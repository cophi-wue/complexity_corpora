Sir
Walter
Elliot
,
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
in
Somersetshire
,
was
a
man
who
,
for
his
own
amusement
,
never
took
up
any
book
but
the
Baronetage
;
there
he
found
occupation
for
an
idle
hour
,
and
consolation
in
a
distressed
one
;
there
his
faculties
were
roused
into
admiration
and
respect
,
by
contemplating
the
limited
remnant
of
the
earliest
patents
;
there
any
unwelcome
sensations
,
arising
from
domestic
affairs
changed
naturally
into
pity
and
contempt
as
he
turned
over
the
almost
endless
creations
of
the
last
century
;
and
there
,
if
every
other
leaf
were
powerless
,
he
could
read
his
own
history
with
an
interest
which
never
failed
.

<EOS>
Precisely
such
had
the
paragraph
originally
stood
from
the
printer
's
hands
;
but
Sir
Walter
had
improved
it
by
adding
,
for
the
information
of
himself
and
his
family
,
these
words
,
after
the
date
of
Mary
's
birth
  
"
Married
,
December
16
,
1810
,
Charles
,
son
and
heir
of
Charles
Musgrove
,
Esq

of
Uppercross
,
in
the
county
of
Somerset
,
"
and
by
inserting
most
accurately
the
day
of
the
month
on
which
he
had
lost
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Then
followed
the
history
and
rise
of
the
ancient
and
respectable
family
,
in
the
usual
terms
;
how
it
had
been
first
settled
in
Cheshire
;
how
mentioned
in
Dugdale
,
serving
the
office
of
high
sheriff
,
representing
a
borough
in
three
successive
parliaments
,
exertions
of
loyalty
,
and
dignity
of
baronet
,
in
the
first
year
of
Charles
II
,
with
all
the
Marys
and
Elizabeths
they
had
married
;
forming
altogether
two
handsome
duodecimo
pages
,
and
concluding
with
the
arms
and
motto
:
 
"
Principal
seat
,
Kellynch
Hall
,
in
the
county
of
Somerset
,
"
and
Sir
Walter
's
handwriting
again
in
this
finale
:
    
<EOS>
"
Heir
presumptive
,
William
Walter
Elliot
,
Esq
.
,
great
grandson
of
the
second
Sir
Walter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Vanity
was
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
's
character
;
vanity
of
person
and
of
situation
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
remarkably
handsome
in
his
youth
;
and
,
at
fifty
-
four
,
was
still
a
very
fine
man
.
<EOS>
Few
women
could
think
more
of
their
personal
appearance
than
he
did
,
nor
could
the
valet
of
any
new
made
lord
be
more
delighted
with
the
place
he
held
in
society
.
<EOS>
He
considered
the
blessing
of
beauty
as
inferior
only
to
the
blessing
of
a
baronetcy
;
and
the
Sir
Walter
Elliot
,
who
united
these
gifts
,
was
the
constant
object
of
his
warmest
respect
and
devotion
.
  
<EOS>
His
good
looks
and
his
rank
had
one
fair
claim
on
his
attachment
;
since
to
them
he
must
have
owed
a
wife
of
very
superior
character
to
any
thing
deserved
by
his
own
.
<EOS>
Lady
Elliot
had
been
an
excellent
woman
,
sensible
and
amiable
;
whose
judgement
and
conduct
,
if
they
might
be
pardoned
the
youthful
infatuation
which
made
her
Lady
Elliot
,
had
never
required
indulgence
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
humoured
,
or
softened
,
or
concealed
his
failings
,
and
promoted
his
real
respectability
for
seventeen
years
;
and
though
not
the
very
happiest
being
in
the
world
herself
,
had
found
enough
in
her
duties
,
her
friends
,
and
her
children
,
to
attach
her
to
life
,
and
make
it
no
matter
of
indifference
to
her
when
she
was
called
on
to
quit
them
.
 
<EOS>
Three
girls
,
the
two
eldest
sixteen
and
fourteen
,
was
an
awful
legacy
for
a
mother
to
bequeath
,
an
awful
charge
rather
,
to
confide
to
the
authority
and
guidance
of
a
conceited
,
silly
father
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
however
,
one
very
intimate
friend
,
a
sensible
,
deserving
woman
,
who
had
been
brought
,
by
strong
attachment
to
herself
,
to
settle
close
by
her
,
in
the
village
of
Kellynch
;
and
on
her
kindness
and
advice
,
Lady
Elliot
mainly
relied
for
the
best
help
and
maintenance
of
the
good
principles
and
instruction
which
she
had
been
anxiously
giving
her
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
This
friend
,
and
Sir
Walter
,
did
not
marry
,
whatever
might
have
been
anticipated
on
that
head
by
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Thirteen
years
had
passed
away
since
Lady
Elliot
's
death
,
and
they
were
still
near
neighbours
and
intimate
friends
,
and
one
remained
a
widower
,
the
other
a
widow
.
  
<EOS>
That
Lady
Russell
,
of
steady
age
and
character
,
and
extremely
well
provided
for
,
should
have
no
thought
of
a
second
marriage
,
needs
no
apology
to
the
public
,
which
is
rather
apt
to
be
unreasonably
discontented
when
a
woman
does
marry
again
,
than
when
she
does
not
;
but
Sir
Walter
's
continuing
in
singleness
requires
explanation
.
<EOS>
Be
it
known
then
,
that
Sir
Walter
,
like
a
good
father
,
(
having
met
with
one
or
two
private
disappointments
in
very
unreasonable
applications
)
,
prided
himself
on
remaining
single
for
his
dear
daughters
'
sake
.
<EOS>
For
one
daughter
,
his
eldest
,
he
would
really
have
given
up
any
thing
,
which
he
had
not
been
very
much
tempted
to
do
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
had
succeeded
,
at
sixteen
,
to
all
that
was
possible
,
of
her
mother
's
rights
and
consequence
;
and
being
very
handsome
,
and
very
like
himself
,
her
influence
had
always
been
great
,
and
they
had
gone
on
together
most
happily
.
<EOS>
His
two
other
children
were
of
very
inferior
value
.
<EOS>
Mary
had
acquired
a
little
artificial
importance
,
by
becoming
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
;
but
Anne
,
with
an
elegance
of
mind
and
sweetness
of
character
,
which
must
have
placed
her
high
with
any
people
of
real
understanding
,
was
nobody
with
either
father
or
sister
;
her
word
had
no
weight
,
her
convenience
was
always
to
give
way
 
<EOS>
she
was
only
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
To
Lady
Russell
,
indeed
,
she
was
a
most
dear
and
highly
valued
god
-
daughter
,
favourite
,
and
friend
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
loved
them
all
;
but
it
was
only
in
Anne
that
she
could
fancy
the
mother
to
revive
again
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
years
before
,
Anne
Elliot
had
been
a
very
pretty
girl
,
but
her
bloom
had
vanished
early
;
and
as
even
in
its
height
,
her
father
had
found
little
to
admire
in
her
,
<EOS>
(
so
totally
different
were
her
delicate
features
and
mild
dark
eyes
from
his
own
)
<EOS>
,
there
could
be
nothing
in
them
,
now
that
she
was
faded
and
thin
,
to
excite
his
esteem
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
indulged
much
hope
,
he
had
now
<EOS>
none
,
of
ever
reading
her
name
in
any
other
page
of
his
favourite
work
.
<EOS>
All
equality
of
alliance
must
rest
with
Elizabeth
,
for
Mary
had
merely
connected
herself
with
an
old
country
family
of
respectability
and
large
fortune
,
and
had
therefore
given
all
the
honour
and
received
none
:
Elizabeth
would
,
one
day
or
other
,
marry
suitably
.
  
<EOS>
It
sometimes
happens
that
a
woman
is
handsomer
at
twenty
-
nine
than
she
was
ten
years
before
;
and
,
generally
speaking
,
<EOS>
if
there
has
been
neither
ill
health
nor
anxiety
,
it
is
a
time
of
life
at
which
scarcely
any
charm
is
lost
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
with
Elizabeth
,
still
the
same
handsome
Miss
Elliot
that
she
had
begun
to
be
thirteen
years
ago
,
and
Sir
Walter
might
be
excused
,
therefore
,
in
forgetting
her
age
,
or
,
at
least
,
be
deemed
only
half
a
fool
,
for
thinking
himself
and
Elizabeth
as
blooming
as
ever
,
amidst
the
wreck
of
the
good
looks
of
everybody
else
;
for
he
could
plainly
see
how
old
all
the
rest
of
his
family
and
acquaintance
were
growing
.
<EOS>
Anne
haggard
,
Mary
coarse
,
every
face
in
the
neighbourhood
worsting
,
and
the
rapid
increase
of
the
crow
's
foot
about
Lady
Russell
's
temples
had
long
been
a
distress
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
did
not
quite
equal
her
father
in
personal
contentment
.
<EOS>
Thirteen
years
had
seen
her
mistress
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
presiding
and
directing
with
a
self
-
possession
and
decision
which
could
never
have
given
the
idea
of
her
being
younger
than
she
was
.
<EOS>
For
thirteen
years
had
she
been
doing
the
honours
,
and
laying
down
the
domestic
law
at
home
,
and
leading
the
way
to
the
chaise
and
four
,
and
walking
immediately
after
Lady
Russell
out
of
all
the
drawing
-
rooms
and
dining
-
rooms
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Thirteen
winters
'
revolving
frosts
had
seen
her
opening
every
ball
of
credit
which
a
scanty
neighbourhood
afforded
,
and
thirteen
springs
shewn
their
blossoms
,
as
she
travelled
up
to
London
with
her
father
,
for
a
few
weeks
'
annual
enjoyment
of
the
great
world
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
remembrance
of
all
this
,
she
had
the
consciousness
of
being
nine
-
and
-
twenty
to
give
her
some
regrets
and
some
apprehensions
;
she
was
fully
satisfied
of
being
still
quite
as
handsome
as
ever
,
but
she
felt
her
approach
to
the
years
of
danger
,
and
would
have
rejoiced
to
be
certain
of
being
properly
solicited
by
baronet
-
blood
within
the
next
twelvemonth
or
two
.
<EOS>
Then
might
she
again
take
up
the
book
of
books
with
as
much
enjoyment
as
in
her
early
youth
,
but
now
she
liked
it
not
.
<EOS>
Always
to
be
presented
with
the
date
of
her
own
birth
and
see
no
marriage
follow
but
that
of
a
youngest
sister
,
made
the
book
an
evil
;
and
more
than
once
,
when
her
father
had
left
it
open
on
the
table
near
her
,
had
she
closed
it
,
with
averted
eyes
,
and
pushed
it
away
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
had
a
disappointment
,
moreover
,
which
that
book
,
and
especially
the
history
of
her
own
family
,
must
ever
present
the
remembrance
of
.
<EOS>
The
heir
presumptive
,
the
very
William
Walter
Elliot
,
Esq
.
,
whose
rights
had
been
so
generously
supported
by
her
father
,
had
disappointed
her
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
,
while
a
very
young
girl
,
as
soon
as
she
had
known
him
to
be
,
in
the
event
of
her
having
no
brother
,
the
future
baronet
,
meant
to
marry
him
,
and
her
father
had
always
meant
that
she
should
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
known
to
them
as
a
boy
;
but
soon
after
Lady
Elliot
's
death
,
Sir
Walter
had
sought
the
acquaintance
,
and
though
his
overtures
had
not
been
met
with
any
warmth
,
he
had
persevered
in
seeking
it
,
making
allowance
for
the
modest
drawing
-
back
of
youth
;
and
,
in
one
of
their
spring
excursions
to
London
,
when
Elizabeth
was
in
her
first
bloom
,
Mr
Elliot
had
been
forced
into
the
introduction
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
at
that
time
a
very
young
man
,
just
engaged
in
the
study
of
the
law
;
and
Elizabeth
found
him
extremely
agreeable
,
and
every
plan
in
his
favour
was
confirmed
.
<EOS>
He
was
invited
to
Kellynch
Hall
;
he
was
talked
of
and
expected
all
the
rest
of
the
year
;
but
he
never
came
.
<EOS>
The
following
spring
he
was
seen
again
in
town
,
found
equally
agreeable
,
again
encouraged
,
invited
,
and
expected
,
and
again
he
did
not
come
;
and
the
next
tidings
were
that
he
was
married
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
pushing
his
fortune
in
the
line
marked
out
for
the
heir
of
the
house
of
Elliot
,
he
had
purchased
independence
by
uniting
himself
to
a
rich
woman
of
inferior
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
has
resented
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
head
of
the
house
,
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
have
been
consulted
,
especially
after
taking
the
young
man
so
publicly
by
the
hand
;
"
For
they
must
have
been
seen
together
,
"
he
observed
,
"
once
at
Tattersall
's
,
and
twice
in
the
lobby
of
the
House
of
Commons
.
"
<EOS>
His
disapprobation
was
expressed
,
but
apparently
very
little
regarded
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
had
attempted
no
apology
,
and
shewn
himself
as
unsolicitous
of
being
longer
noticed
by
the
family
,
as
Sir
Walter
considered
him
unworthy
of
it
:
all
acquaintance
between
them
had
ceased
.
  
<EOS>
This
very
awkward
history
of
Mr
Elliot
was
still
,
after
an
interval
of
several
years
,
felt
with
anger
by
Elizabeth
,
who
had
liked
the
man
for
himself
,
and
still
more
for
being
her
father
's
heir
,
and
whose
strong
family
pride
could
see
only
in
him
a
proper
match
for
Sir
Walter
Elliot
's
eldest
daughter
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
baronet
from
A
to
Z
whom
her
feelings
could
have
so
willingly
acknowledged
as
an
equal
.
<EOS>
Yet
so
miserably
had
he
conducted
himself
,
that
though
she
was
at
this
present
time
(
the
summer
of
1814
)
wearing
black
ribbons
for
his
wife
,
she
could
not
admit
him
to
be
worth
thinking
of
again
.
<EOS>
The
disgrace
of
his
first
marriage
might
,
perhaps
,
as
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
it
perpetuated
by
offspring
,
have
been
got
over
,
had
he
not
done
worse
;
but
he
had
,
as
by
the
accustomary
intervention
of
kind
friends
,
they
had
been
informed
,
spoken
most
disrespectfully
of
them
all
,
most
slightingly
and
contemptuously
of
the
very
blood
he
belonged
to
,
and
the
honours
which
were
hereafter
to
be
his
own
.
<EOS>
This
could
not
be
pardoned
.
  
<EOS>
Such
were
Elizabeth
Elliot
's
sentiments
and
sensations
;
such
the
cares
to
alloy
,
the
agitations
to
vary
,
the
sameness
and
the
elegance
,
the
prosperity
and
the
nothingness
of
her
scene
of
life
;
such
the
feelings
to
give
interest
to
a
long
,
uneventful
residence
in
one
country
circle
,
to
fill
the
vacancies
which
there
were
no
habits
of
utility
abroad
,
no
talents
or
accomplishments
for
home
,
to
occupy
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
another
occupation
and
solicitude
of
mind
was
beginning
to
be
added
to
these
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
growing
distressed
for
money
.
<EOS>
She
knew
,
that
when
he
now
took
up
the
Baronetage
,
it
was
to
drive
the
heavy
bills
of
his
tradespeople
,
and
the
unwelcome
hints
of
Mr
Shepherd
,
his
agent
,
from
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
Kellynch
property
was
good
,
but
not
equal
to
Sir
Walter
's
apprehension
of
the
state
required
in
its
possessor
.
<EOS>
While
Lady
Elliot
lived
,
there
had
been
method
,
moderation
,
and
economy
,
which
had
just
kept
him
within
his
income
;
but
with
her
had
died
all
such
right
-
mindedness
,
and
from
that
period
he
had
been
constantly
exceeding
it
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
possible
for
him
to
spend
less
;
he
had
done
nothing
but
what
Sir
Walter
Elliot
was
imperiously
called
on
to
do
;
but
blameless
as
he
was
,
he
was
not
only
growing
dreadfully
in
debt
,
but
was
hearing
of
it
so
often
,
that
it
became
vain
to
attempt
concealing
it
longer
,
even
partially
,
from
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
had
given
her
some
hints
of
it
the
last
spring
in
town
;
he
had
gone
so
far
even
as
to
say
,
"
Can
we
retrench
?
<EOS>
Does
it
occur
to
you
that
there
is
any
one
article
in
which
we
can
retrench
?
"
<EOS>
and
Elizabeth
,
to
do
her
justice
,
had
,
in
the
first
ardour
of
female
alarm
,
set
seriously
to
think
what
could
be
done
,
and
had
finally
proposed
these
two
branches
of
economy
,
to
cut
off
some
unnecessary
charities
,
and
to
refrain
from
new
furnishing
the
drawing
-
room
;
to
which
expedients
she
afterwards
added
the
happy
thought
of
their
taking
no
present
down
to
Anne
,
as
had
been
the
usual
yearly
custom
.
<EOS>
But
these
measures
,
however
good
in
themselves
,
were
insufficient
for
the
real
extent
of
the
evil
,
the
whole
of
which
Sir
Walter
found
himself
obliged
to
confess
to
her
soon
afterwards
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
had
nothing
to
propose
of
deeper
efficacy
.
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
ill
-
used
and
unfortunate
,
as
did
her
father
;
and
they
were
neither
of
them
able
to
devise
any
means
of
lessening
their
expenses
without
compromising
their
dignity
,
or
relinquishing
their
comforts
in
a
way
not
to
be
borne
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
only
a
small
part
of
his
estate
that
Sir
Walter
could
dispose
of
;
but
had
every
acre
been
alienable
,
it
would
have
made
no
difference
.
<EOS>
He
had
condescended
to
mortgage
as
far
as
he
had
the
power
,
but
he
would
never
condescend
to
sell
.
<EOS>
No
;
he
would
never
disgrace
his
name
so
far
.
<EOS>
The
Kellynch
estate
should
be
transmitted
whole
and
entire
,
as
he
had
received
it
.
  
<EOS>
Their
two
confidential
friends
,
Mr
Shepherd
,
who
lived
in
the
neighbouring
market
town
,
and
Lady
Russell
,
were
called
to
advise
them
;
and
both
father
and
daughter
seemed
to
expect
that
something
should
be
struck
out
by
one
or
the
other
to
remove
their
embarrassments
and
reduce
their
expenditure
,
without
involving
the
loss
of
any
indulgence
of
taste
or
pride
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
,
a
civil
,
cautious
lawyer
,
who
,
whatever
might
be
his
hold
or
his
views
on
Sir
Walter
,
would
rather
have
the
disagreeable
prompted
by
anybody
else
,
excused
himself
from
offering
the
slightest
hint
,
and
only
begged
leave
to
recommend
an
implicit
reference
to
the
excellent
judgement
of
Lady
Russell
,
from
whose
known
good
sense
he
fully
expected
to
have
just
such
resolute
measures
advised
as
he
meant
to
see
finally
adopted
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
was
most
anxiously
zealous
on
the
subject
,
and
gave
it
much
serious
consideration
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
rather
of
sound
than
of
quick
abilities
,
whose
difficulties
in
coming
to
any
decision
in
this
instance
were
great
,
from
the
opposition
of
two
leading
principles
.
<EOS>
She
was
of
strict
integrity
herself
,
with
a
delicate
sense
of
honour
;
but
she
was
as
desirous
of
saving
Sir
Walter
's
feelings
,
as
solicitous
for
the
credit
of
the
family
,
as
aristocratic
in
her
ideas
of
what
was
due
to
them
,
as
anybody
of
sense
and
honesty
could
well
be
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
benevolent
,
charitable
,
good
woman
,
and
capable
of
strong
attachments
,
most
correct
in
her
conduct
,
strict
in
her
notions
of
decorum
,
and
with
manners
that
were
held
a
standard
of
good
-
breeding
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
cultivated
mind
,
and
was
,
generally
speaking
,
rational
and
consistent
;
but
she
had
prejudices
on
the
side
of
ancestry
;
she
had
a
value
for
rank
and
consequence
,
which
blinded
her
a
little
to
the
faults
of
those
who
possessed
them
.
<EOS>
Herself
the
widow
of
only
a
knight
,
she
gave
the
dignity
of
a
baronet
all
its
due
;
and
Sir
Walter
,
independent
of
his
claims
as
an
old
acquaintance
,
an
attentive
neighbour
,
an
obliging
landlord
,
the
husband
of
her
very
dear
friend
,
the
father
of
Anne
and
her
sisters
,
was
,
as
being
Sir
Walter
,
in
her
apprehension
,
entitled
to
a
great
deal
of
compassion
and
consideration
under
his
present
difficulties
.
  
<EOS>
They
must
retrench
;
that
did
not
admit
of
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
very
anxious
to
have
it
done
with
the
least
possible
pain
to
him
and
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
She
drew
up
plans
of
economy
,
she
made
exact
calculations
,
and
she
did
what
nobody
else
thought
of
doing
<EOS>
:
she
consulted
Anne
,
who
never
seemed
considered
by
the
others
as
having
any
interest
in
the
question
.
<EOS>
She
consulted
,
and
in
a
degree
was
influenced
by
her
in
marking
out
the
scheme
of
retrenchment
which
was
at
last
submitted
to
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
Every
emendation
of
Anne
's
had
been
on
the
side
of
honesty
against
importance
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
more
vigorous
measures
,
a
more
complete
reformation
,
a
quicker
release
from
debt
,
a
much
higher
tone
of
indifference
for
everything
but
justice
and
equity
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
we
can
persuade
your
father
to
all
this
,
"
said
Lady
Russell
,
looking
over
her
paper
,
"
much
may
be
done
.
<EOS>
If
he
will
adopt
these
regulations
,
in
seven
years
he
will
be
clear
;
and
I
hope
we
may
be
able
to
convince
him
and
Elizabeth
,
that
Kellynch
Hall
has
a
respectability
in
itself
which
can
not
be
affected
by
these
reductions
;
and
that
the
true
dignity
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
will
be
very
far
from
lessened
in
the
eyes
of
sensible
people
,
by
acting
like
a
man
of
principle
.
<EOS>
What
will
he
be
doing
,
in
fact
,
but
what
very
many
of
our
first
families
have
done
,
or
ought
to
do
?
<EOS>
There
will
be
nothing
singular
in
his
case
;
and
it
is
singularity
which
often
makes
the
worst
part
of
our
suffering
,
as
it
always
does
of
our
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
have
great
hope
of
prevailing
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
serious
and
decided
;
for
after
all
,
the
person
who
has
contracted
debts
must
pay
them
;
and
though
a
great
deal
is
due
to
the
feelings
of
the
gentleman
,
and
the
head
of
a
house
,
like
your
father
,
there
is
still
more
due
to
the
character
of
an
honest
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
principle
on
which
Anne
wanted
her
father
to
be
proceeding
,
his
friends
to
be
urging
him
.
<EOS>
She
considered
it
as
an
act
of
indispensable
duty
to
clear
away
the
claims
of
creditors
with
all
the
expedition
which
the
most
comprehensive
retrenchments
could
secure
,
and
saw
no
dignity
in
anything
short
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
it
to
be
prescribed
,
and
felt
as
a
duty
.
<EOS>
She
rated
Lady
Russell
's
influence
highly
;
and
as
to
the
severe
degree
of
self
-
denial
which
her
own
conscience
prompted
,
she
believed
there
might
be
little
more
difficulty
in
persuading
them
to
a
complete
,
than
to
half
a
reformation
.
<EOS>
Her
knowledge
of
her
father
and
Elizabeth
inclined
her
to
think
that
the
sacrifice
of
one
pair
of
horses
would
be
hardly
less
painful
than
of
both
,
and
so
on
,
through
the
whole
list
of
Lady
Russell
's
too
gentle
reductions
.
  
<EOS>
How
Anne
's
more
rigid
requisitions
might
have
been
taken
is
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
's
had
no
success
at
all
:
could
not
be
put
up
with
,
were
not
to
be
borne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
every
comfort
of
life
knocked
off
!
<EOS>
Journeys
,
London
,
servants
,
horses
,
table
 
contractions
and
restrictions
every
where
!
<EOS>
To
live
no
longer
with
the
decencies
even
of
a
private
gentleman
!
<EOS>
No
,
he
would
sooner
quit
Kellynch
Hall
at
once
,
than
remain
in
it
on
such
disgraceful
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Quit
Kellynch
Hall
.
<EOS>
"
The
hint
was
immediately
taken
up
by
Mr
Shepherd
,
whose
interest
was
involved
in
the
reality
of
Sir
Walter
's
retrenching
,
and
who
was
perfectly
persuaded
that
nothing
would
be
done
without
a
change
of
abode
.
"
<EOS>
Since
the
idea
had
been
started
in
the
very
quarter
which
ought
to
dictate
,
he
had
no
scruple
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
confessing
his
judgement
to
be
entirely
on
that
side
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
appear
to
him
that
Sir
Walter
could
materially
alter
his
style
of
living
in
a
house
which
had
such
a
character
of
hospitality
and
ancient
dignity
to
support
.
<EOS>
In
any
other
place
Sir
Walter
might
judge
for
himself
;
and
would
be
looked
up
to
,
as
regulating
the
modes
of
life
in
whatever
way
he
might
choose
to
model
his
household
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
would
quit
Kellynch
Hall
;
and
after
a
very
few
days
more
of
doubt
and
indecision
,
the
great
question
of
whither
he
should
go
was
settled
,
and
the
first
outline
of
this
important
change
made
out
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
three
alternatives
,
London
,
Bath
,
or
another
house
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
All
Anne
's
wishes
had
been
for
the
latter
.
<EOS>
A
small
house
in
their
own
neighbourhood
,
where
they
might
still
have
Lady
Russell
's
society
,
still
be
near
Mary
,
and
still
have
the
pleasure
of
sometimes
seeing
the
lawns
and
groves
of
Kellynch
,
was
the
object
of
her
ambition
.
<EOS>
But
the
usual
fate
of
Anne
attended
her
,
in
having
something
very
opposite
from
her
inclination
fixed
on
.
<EOS>
She
disliked
Bath
,
and
did
not
think
it
agreed
with
her
;
and
Bath
was
to
be
her
home
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
had
at
first
thought
more
of
London
;
but
Mr
Shepherd
felt
that
he
could
not
be
trusted
in
London
,
and
had
been
skilful
enough
to
dissuade
him
from
it
,
and
make
Bath
preferred
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
much
safer
place
for
a
gentleman
in
his
predicament
:
he
might
there
be
important
at
comparatively
little
expense
.
<EOS>
Two
material
advantages
of
Bath
over
London
had
of
course
been
given
all
their
weight
:
its
more
convenient
distance
from
Kellynch
,
only
fifty
miles
,
and
Lady
Russell
's
spending
some
part
of
every
winter
there
;
and
to
the
very
great
satisfaction
of
Lady
Russell
,
whose
first
views
on
the
projected
change
had
been
for
Bath
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
induced
to
believe
that
they
should
lose
neither
consequence
nor
enjoyment
by
settling
there
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
felt
obliged
to
oppose
her
dear
Anne
's
known
wishes
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
too
much
to
expect
Sir
Walter
to
descend
into
a
small
house
in
his
own
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
Anne
herself
would
have
found
the
mortifications
of
it
more
than
she
foresaw
,
and
to
Sir
Walter
's
feelings
they
must
have
been
dreadful
.
<EOS>
And
with
regard
to
Anne
's
dislike
of
Bath
,
she
considered
it
as
a
prejudice
and
mistake
arising
,
first
,
from
the
circumstance
of
her
having
been
three
years
at
school
there
,
after
her
mother
's
death
;
and
secondly
,
from
her
happening
to
be
not
in
perfectly
good
spirits
<EOS>
the
only
winter
which
she
had
afterwards
spent
there
with
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
was
fond
of
Bath
,
in
short
,
and
disposed
to
think
it
must
suit
them
all
;
and
as
to
her
young
friend
's
health
,
by
passing
all
the
warm
months
with
her
at
Kellynch
Lodge
,
every
danger
would
be
avoided
;
and
it
was
in
fact
,
a
change
which
must
do
both
health
and
spirits
good
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
been
too
little
from
home
,
too
little
seen
.
<EOS>
Her
spirits
were
not
high
.
<EOS>
A
larger
society
would
improve
them
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
her
to
be
more
known
.
  
<EOS>
The
undesirableness
of
any
other
house
in
the
same
neighbourhood
for
Sir
Walter
was
certainly
much
strengthened
by
one
part
,
and
a
very
material
part
of
the
scheme
,
which
had
been
happily
engrafted
on
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
only
to
quit
his
home
,
but
to
see
it
in
the
hands
of
others
;
a
trial
of
fortitude
,
which
stronger
heads
than
Sir
Walter
's
have
found
too
much
.
<EOS>
Kellynch
Hall
was
to
be
let
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
a
profound
secret
,
not
to
be
breathed
beyond
their
own
circle
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
could
not
have
borne
the
degradation
of
being
known
to
design
letting
his
house
.
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
had
once
mentioned
the
word
"
advertise
,
"
but
never
dared
approach
it
again
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
spurned
the
idea
of
its
being
offered
in
any
manner
;
forbad
the
slightest
hint
being
dropped
of
his
having
such
an
intention
;
and
it
was
only
on
the
supposition
of
his
being
spontaneously
solicited
by
some
most
unexceptionable
applicant
,
on
his
own
terms
,
and
as
a
great
favour
,
that
he
would
let
it
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
How
quick
come
the
reasons
for
approving
what
we
like
!
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
had
another
excellent
one
at
hand
,
for
being
extremely
glad
that
Sir
Walter
and
his
family
were
to
remove
from
the
country
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
had
been
lately
forming
an
intimacy
,
which
she
wished
to
see
interrupted
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
the
daughter
of
Mr
Shepherd
,
who
had
returned
,
after
an
unprosperous
marriage
,
to
her
father
's
house
,
with
the
additional
burden
of
two
children
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
clever
young
woman
,
who
understood
the
art
of
pleasing
 
the
art
of
pleasing
,
at
least
,
at
Kellynch
Hall
;
and
who
had
made
herself
so
acceptable
to
Miss
Elliot
,
as
to
have
been
already
staying
there
more
than
once
,
in
spite
of
all
that
Lady
Russell
,
who
thought
it
a
friendship
quite
out
of
place
,
could
hint
of
caution
and
reserve
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
,
indeed
,
had
scarcely
any
influence
with
Elizabeth
,
and
seemed
to
love
her
,
rather
because
she
would
love
her
,
than
because
Elizabeth
deserved
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
received
from
her
more
than
outward
attention
,
nothing
beyond
the
observances
of
complaisance
;
had
never
succeeded
in
any
point
which
she
wanted
to
carry
,
against
previous
inclination
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
repeatedly
very
earnest
in
trying
to
get
Anne
included
in
the
visit
to
London
,
sensibly
open
to
all
the
injustice
and
all
the
discredit
of
the
selfish
arrangements
which
shut
her
out
,
and
on
many
lesser
occasions
had
endeavoured
to
give
Elizabeth
the
advantage
of
her
own
better
judgement
and
experience
;
but
always
in
vain
:
Elizabeth
would
go
her
own
way
;
and
never
had
she
pursued
it
in
more
decided
opposition
to
Lady
Russell
than
in
this
selection
of
Mrs
Clay
;
turning
from
the
society
of
so
deserving
a
sister
,
to
bestow
her
affection
and
confidence
on
one
who
ought
to
have
been
nothing
to
her
<EOS>
but
the
object
of
distant
civility
.
  
<EOS>
From
situation
,
Mrs
Clay
was
,
in
Lady
Russell
's
estimate
,
a
very
unequal
,
and
in
her
character
she
believed
a
very
dangerous
companion
;
and
a
removal
that
would
leave
Mrs
Clay
behind
,
and
bring
a
choice
of
more
suitable
intimates
within
Miss
Elliot
's
reach
,
was
therefore
an
object
of
first
-
rate
importance
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
leave
to
observe
,
Sir
Walter
,
"
said
Mr
Shepherd
one
morning
at
Kellynch
Hall
,
as
he
laid
down
the
newspaper
,
"
that
the
present
juncture
is
much
in
our
favour
.
<EOS>
This
peace
will
be
turning
all
our
rich
naval
officers
ashore
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
all
wanting
a
home
.
<EOS>
Could
not
be
a
better
time
,
Sir
Walter
,
for
having
a
choice
of
tenants
,
very
responsible
tenants
.
<EOS>
Many
a
noble
fortune
has
been
made
during
the
war
.
<EOS>
If
a
rich
admiral
were
to
come
in
our
way
,
Sir
Walter
 
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
would
be
a
very
lucky
man
,
Shepherd
,
"
replied
Sir
Walter
;
"
that
's
all
I
have
to
remark
.
<EOS>
A
prize
indeed
would
Kellynch
Hall
be
to
him
;
rather
the
greatest
prize
of
all
,
let
him
have
taken
ever
so
many
before
;
hey
,
Shepherd
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
laughed
,
as
he
knew
he
must
,
at
this
wit
,
and
then
added
    
<EOS>
"
I
presume
to
observe
,
Sir
Walter
,
that
,
in
the
way
of
business
,
gentlemen
of
the
navy
are
well
to
deal
with
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
little
knowledge
of
their
methods
of
doing
business
;
and
I
am
free
to
confess
that
they
have
very
liberal
notions
,
and
are
as
likely
to
make
desirable
tenants
as
any
set
of
people
one
should
meet
with
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
Sir
Walter
,
what
I
would
take
leave
to
suggest
is
,
that
if
in
consequence
of
any
rumours
getting
abroad
of
your
intention
;
which
must
be
contemplated
as
a
possible
thing
,
because
we
know
how
difficult
it
is
to
keep
the
actions
and
designs
of
one
part
of
the
world
from
the
notice
and
curiosity
of
the
other
;
consequence
has
its
tax
;
I
,
John
Shepherd
,
might
conceal
any
family
-
matters
that
I
chose
,
for
nobody
would
think
it
worth
their
while
to
observe
me
;
but
Sir
Walter
Elliot
has
eyes
upon
him
which
it
may
be
very
difficult
to
elude
;
and
therefore
,
thus
much
I
venture
upon
,
that
it
will
not
greatly
surprise
me
if
,
with
all
our
caution
,
some
rumour
of
the
truth
should
get
abroad
;
in
the
supposition
of
which
,
as
I
was
going
to
observe
,
since
applications
will
unquestionably
follow
,
I
should
think
any
from
our
wealthy
naval
commanders
particularly
worth
attending
to
;
and
beg
leave
to
add
,
that
two
hours
will
bring
me
over
at
any
time
,
to
save
you
the
trouble
of
replying
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
only
nodded
.
<EOS>
But
soon
afterwards
,
rising
and
pacing
the
room
,
he
observed
sarcastically
    
"
There
are
few
among
the
gentlemen
of
the
navy
,
I
imagine
,
who
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
themselves
in
a
house
of
this
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
They
would
look
around
them
,
no
doubt
,
and
bless
their
good
fortune
,
"
said
Mrs
Clay
,
for
Mrs
Clay
was
present
:
her
father
had
driven
her
over
,
nothing
being
of
so
much
use
to
Mrs
Clay
's
health
as
a
drive
to
Kellynch
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
quite
agree
with
my
father
in
thinking
a
sailor
might
be
a
very
desirable
tenant
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
a
good
deal
of
the
profession
;
and
besides
their
liberality
,
they
are
so
neat
and
careful
in
all
their
ways
!
<EOS>
These
valuable
pictures
of
yours
,
Sir
Walter
,
if
you
chose
to
leave
them
,
would
be
perfectly
safe
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
and
about
the
house
would
be
taken
such
excellent
care
of
!
<EOS>
The
gardens
and
shrubberies
would
be
kept
in
almost
as
high
order
as
they
are
now
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
be
afraid
,
Miss
Elliot
,
of
your
own
sweet
flower
gardens
being
neglected
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
As
to
all
that
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Walter
coolly
,
"
supposing
I
were
induced
to
let
my
house
,
I
have
by
no
means
made
up
my
mind
as
to
the
privileges
to
be
annexed
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
particularly
disposed
to
favour
a
tenant
.
<EOS>
The
park
would
be
open
to
him
of
course
,
and
few
navy
officers
,
or
men
of
any
other
description
,
can
have
had
such
a
range
;
but
what
restrictions
I
might
impose
on
the
use
of
the
pleasure
-
grounds
,
is
another
thing
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
fond
of
the
idea
of
my
shrubberies
being
always
approachable
;
and
I
should
recommend
Miss
Elliot
to
be
on
her
guard
with
respect
to
her
flower
garden
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
little
disposed
to
grant
a
tenant
of
Kellynch
Hall
any
extraordinary
favour
,
I
assure
you
,
be
he
sailor
or
soldier
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
Mr
Shepherd
presumed
to
say
    
"
In
all
these
cases
,
there
are
established
usages
which
make
everything
plain
and
easy
between
landlord
and
tenant
.
<EOS>
Your
interest
,
Sir
Walter
,
is
in
pretty
safe
hands
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
me
for
taking
care
that
no
tenant
has
more
than
his
just
rights
.
<EOS>
I
venture
to
hint
,
that
Sir
Walter
Elliot
can
not
be
half
so
jealous
for
his
own
,
as
John
Shepherd
will
be
for
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Anne
spoke
    
"
The
navy
,
I
think
,
who
have
done
so
much
for
us
,
have
at
least
an
equal
claim
with
any
other
set
of
men
,
for
all
the
comforts
and
all
the
privileges
which
any
home
can
give
.
<EOS>
Sailors
work
hard
enough
for
their
comforts
,
we
must
all
allow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
very
true
.
<EOS>
What
Miss
Anne
says
,
is
very
true
,
"
was
Mr
Shepherd
's
rejoinder
,
and
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
certainly
,
"
was
his
daughter
's
;
but
Sir
Walter
's
remark
was
,
soon
afterwards
    
"
<EOS>
The
profession
has
its
utility
,
but
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
any
friend
of
mine
belonging
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
reply
,
and
with
a
look
of
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
it
is
in
two
points
offensive
to
me
;
I
have
two
strong
grounds
of
objection
to
it
.
<EOS>
First
,
as
being
the
means
of
bringing
persons
of
obscure
birth
into
undue
distinction
,
and
raising
men
to
honours
which
their
fathers
and
grandfathers
never
dreamt
of
;
and
secondly
,
as
it
cuts
up
a
man
's
youth
and
vigour
most
horribly
;
a
sailor
grows
old
sooner
than
any
other
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
it
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
A
man
is
in
greater
danger
in
the
navy
of
being
insulted
by
the
rise
of
one
whose
father
,
his
father
might
have
disdained
to
speak
to
,
and
of
becoming
prematurely
an
object
of
disgust
himself
,
than
in
any
other
line
.
<EOS>
One
day
last
spring
,
in
town
,
I
was
in
company
with
two
men
,
striking
instances
of
what
I
am
talking
of
;
Lord
St
Ives
,
whose
father
we
all
know
to
have
been
a
country
curate
,
without
bread
to
eat
;
<EOS>
I
was
to
give
place
to
Lord
St
Ives
,
and
a
certain
Admiral
Baldwin
,
the
most
deplorable
-
looking
personage
you
can
imagine
;
his
face
the
colour
of
mahogany
,
rough
and
rugged
to
the
last
degree
;
all
lines
and
wrinkles
,
nine
grey
hairs
of
a
side
,
and
nothing
but
a
dab
of
powder
at
top
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
heaven
,
who
is
that
old
fellow
?
"
said
I
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
standing
near
,
(
Sir
Basil
Morley
)
.
<EOS>
"
Old
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Basil
,
"
it
is
Admiral
Baldwin
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
take
his
age
to
be
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sixty
,
"
said
I
,
"
or
perhaps
sixty
-
two
.
"
<EOS>
"
Forty
,
"
replied
Sir
Basil
,
"
forty
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Picture
to
yourselves
my
amazement
;
I
shall
not
easily
forget
Admiral
Baldwin
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
quite
so
wretched
an
example
of
what
a
sea
-
faring
life
can
do
;
but
to
a
degree
,
I
know
it
is
the
same
with
them
all
:
they
are
all
knocked
about
,
and
exposed
to
every
climate
,
and
every
weather
,
till
they
are
not
fit
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
they
are
not
knocked
on
the
head
at
once
,
before
they
reach
Admiral
Baldwin
's
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Sir
Walter
,
"
cried
Mrs
Clay
,
"
this
is
being
severe
indeed
.
<EOS>
Have
a
little
mercy
on
the
poor
men
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
all
born
to
be
handsome
.
<EOS>
The
sea
is
no
beautifier
,
certainly
;
sailors
do
grow
old
betimes
;
I
have
observed
it
;
they
soon
lose
the
look
of
youth
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
is
not
it
the
same
with
many
other
professions
,
perhaps
most
other
?
<EOS>
Soldiers
,
in
active
service
,
are
not
at
all
better
off
:
and
even
in
the
quieter
professions
,
there
is
a
toil
and
a
labour
of
the
mind
,
if
not
of
the
body
,
which
seldom
leaves
a
man
's
looks
to
the
natural
effect
of
time
.
<EOS>
The
lawyer
plods
,
quite
care
-
worn
;
the
physician
is
up
at
all
hours
,
and
travelling
in
all
weather
;
and
even
the
clergyman
 
<EOS>
"
she
stopt
a
moment
to
consider
what
might
do
for
the
clergyman
;
 
"
and
even
the
clergyman
,
you
know
is
obliged
to
go
into
infected
rooms
,
and
expose
his
health
and
looks
to
all
the
injury
of
a
poisonous
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
as
I
have
long
been
convinced
,
though
every
profession
is
necessary
and
honourable
in
its
turn
,
it
is
only
the
lot
of
those
who
are
not
obliged
to
follow
any
,
who
can
live
in
a
regular
way
,
in
the
country
,
choosing
their
own
hours
,
following
their
own
pursuits
,
and
living
on
their
own
property
,
without
the
torment
of
trying
for
more
;
it
is
only
their
lot
,
I
say
,
to
hold
the
blessings
of
health
and
a
good
appearance
to
the
utmost
:
<EOS>
I
know
no
other
set
of
men
but
what
lose
something
of
their
personableness
when
they
cease
to
be
quite
young
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
Mr
Shepherd
,
in
this
anxiety
to
bespeak
Sir
Walter
's
good
will
towards
a
naval
officer
as
tenant
,
had
been
gifted
with
foresight
;
for
the
very
first
application
for
the
house
was
from
an
Admiral
Croft
,
with
whom
he
shortly
afterwards
fell
into
company
in
attending
the
quarter
sessions
at
Taunton
;
and
indeed
,
he
had
received
a
hint
of
the
Admiral
from
a
London
correspondent
.
<EOS>
By
the
report
which
he
hastened
over
to
Kellynch
to
make
,
Admiral
Croft
was
a
native
of
Somersetshire
,
who
having
acquired
a
very
handsome
fortune
,
was
wishing
to
settle
in
his
own
country
,
and
had
come
down
to
Taunton
in
order
to
look
at
some
advertised
places
in
that
immediate
neighbourhood
,
which
,
however
,
had
not
suited
him
;
that
accidentally
hearing
 
(
it
was
just
as
he
had
foretold
,
Mr
Shepherd
observed
,
Sir
Walter
's
concerns
could
not
be
kept
a
secret
,
)
 
accidentally
hearing
of
the
possibility
of
Kellynch
Hall
being
to
let
,
and
understanding
his
(
Mr
Shepherd
's
)
connection
with
the
owner
,
he
had
introduced
himself
to
him
in
order
to
make
particular
inquiries
,
and
had
,
in
the
course
of
a
pretty
long
conference
,
expressed
as
strong
an
inclination
for
the
place
as
a
man
who
knew
it
only
by
description
could
feel
;
and
given
Mr
Shepherd
,
in
his
explicit
account
of
himself
,
every
proof
of
his
being
a
most
responsible
,
eligible
tenant
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
who
is
Admiral
Croft
?
<EOS>
"
was
Sir
Walter
's
cold
suspicious
inquiry
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
answered
for
his
being
of
a
gentleman
's
family
,
and
mentioned
a
place
;
and
Anne
,
after
the
little
pause
which
followed
,
added
    
"
He
is
a
rear
admiral
of
the
white
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
Trafalgar
action
,
and
has
been
in
the
East
Indies
since
;
he
was
stationed
there
,
I
believe
,
several
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
take
it
for
granted
,
"
observed
Sir
Walter
,
"
that
his
face
is
about
as
orange
as
the
cuffs
and
capes
of
my
livery
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
hastened
to
assure
him
,
that
Admiral
Croft
was
a
very
hale
,
hearty
,
well
-
looking
man
,
a
little
weather
-
beaten
,
to
be
sure
,
but
not
much
,
and
quite
the
gentleman
in
all
his
notions
and
behaviour
;
not
likely
to
make
the
smallest
difficulty
about
terms
,
only
wanted
a
comfortable
home
,
and
to
get
into
it
as
soon
as
possible
;
knew
he
must
pay
for
his
convenience
;
knew
what
rent
a
ready
-
furnished
house
of
that
consequence
might
fetch
;
should
not
have
been
surprised
if
Sir
Walter
had
asked
more
;
had
inquired
about
the
manor
;
would
be
glad
of
the
deputation
,
certainly
,
but
made
no
great
point
of
it
;
said
he
sometimes
took
out
a
gun
,
but
never
killed
;
quite
the
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
was
eloquent
on
the
subject
;
pointing
out
all
the
circumstances
of
the
Admiral
's
family
,
which
made
him
peculiarly
desirable
as
a
tenant
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
married
man
,
and
without
children
;
the
very
state
to
be
wished
for
.
<EOS>
A
house
was
never
taken
good
care
of
,
Mr
Shepherd
observed
,
without
a
lady
:
<EOS>
he
did
not
know
,
whether
furniture
might
not
be
in
danger
of
suffering
as
much
where
there
was
no
lady
,
as
where
there
were
many
children
.
<EOS>
A
lady
,
without
a
family
,
was
the
very
best
preserver
of
furniture
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
Mrs
Croft
,
too
;
she
was
at
Taunton
with
the
admiral
,
and
had
been
present
almost
all
the
time
they
were
talking
the
matter
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
a
very
well
-
spoken
,
genteel
,
shrewd
lady
,
she
seemed
to
be
,
"
continued
he
;
"
asked
more
questions
about
the
house
,
and
terms
,
and
taxes
,
than
the
Admiral
himself
,
and
seemed
more
conversant
with
business
;
and
moreover
,
Sir
Walter
,
I
found
she
was
not
quite
unconnected
in
this
country
,
any
more
than
her
husband
;
that
is
to
say
,
she
is
sister
to
a
gentleman
who
did
live
amongst
us
once
;
she
told
me
so
herself
:
sister
to
the
gentleman
who
lived
a
few
years
back
at
Monkford
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
what
was
his
name
?
<EOS>
At
this
moment
I
can
not
recollect
his
name
,
though
I
have
heard
it
so
lately
.
<EOS>
Penelope
,
my
dear
,
can
you
help
me
to
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
lived
at
Monkford
:
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
's
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Clay
was
talking
so
eagerly
with
Miss
Elliot
,
that
she
did
not
hear
the
appeal
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
conception
whom
you
can
mean
,
Shepherd
;
I
remember
no
gentleman
resident
at
Monkford
since
the
time
of
old
Governor
Trent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
very
odd
!
<EOS>
I
shall
forget
my
own
name
soon
,
I
suppose
.
<EOS>
A
name
that
I
am
so
very
well
acquainted
with
;
knew
the
gentleman
so
well
by
sight
;
seen
him
a
hundred
times
;
came
to
consult
me
once
<EOS>
,
I
remember
,
about
a
trespass
of
one
of
his
neighbours
;
farmer
's
man
breaking
into
his
orchard
;
wall
torn
down
;
apples
stolen
;
caught
in
the
fact
;
and
afterwards
,
contrary
to
my
judgement
,
submitted
to
an
amicable
compromise
.
<EOS>
Very
odd
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
waiting
another
moment
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
mean
Mr
Wentworth
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
was
all
gratitude
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wentworth
was
the
very
name
!
<EOS>
Mr
Wentworth
was
the
very
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
curacy
of
Monkford
,
you
know
,
Sir
Walter
,
some
time
back
,
for
two
or
three
years
.
<EOS>
Came
there
about
the
year
5
<EOS>
,
I
take
it
.
<EOS>
You
remember
him
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wentworth
?
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
ay
,
 
<EOS>
Mr
Wentworth
,
the
curate
of
Monkford
.
<EOS>
You
misled
me
by
the
term
gentleman
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
speaking
of
some
man
of
property
:
<EOS>
Mr
Wentworth
was
nobody
,
I
remember
;
quite
unconnected
;
nothing
to
do
with
the
Strafford
family
.
<EOS>
One
wonders
how
the
names
of
many
of
our
nobility
become
so
common
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mr
Shepherd
perceived
that
this
connexion
of
the
Crofts
did
them
no
service
with
Sir
Walter
,
he
mentioned
it
no
more
;
returning
,
with
all
his
zeal
,
to
dwell
on
the
circumstances
more
indisputably
in
their
favour
;
their
age
,
and
number
,
and
fortune
;
the
high
idea
they
had
formed
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
and
extreme
solicitude
for
the
advantage
of
renting
it
;
<EOS>
making
it
appear
as
if
they
ranked
nothing
beyond
the
happiness
of
being
the
tenants
of
Sir
Walter
Elliot
:
an
extraordinary
taste
,
certainly
,
could
they
have
been
supposed
in
the
secret
of
Sir
Walter
's
estimate
of
the
dues
of
a
tenant
.
  
<EOS>
It
succeeded
,
however
;
and
though
Sir
Walter
must
ever
look
with
an
evil
eye
on
anyone
intending
to
inhabit
that
house
,
and
think
them
infinitely
too
well
off
in
being
permitted
to
rent
it
on
the
highest
terms
,
he
was
talked
into
allowing
Mr
Shepherd
to
proceed
in
the
treaty
,
and
authorising
him
to
wait
on
Admiral
Croft
,
who
still
remained
at
Taunton
,
and
fix
a
day
for
the
house
being
seen
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
was
not
very
wise
;
but
still
he
had
experience
enough
of
the
world
to
feel
,
that
a
more
unobjectionable
tenant
,
in
all
essentials
,
than
Admiral
Croft
bid
fair
to
be
,
could
hardly
offer
.
<EOS>
So
far
went
his
understanding
;
and
his
vanity
supplied
a
little
additional
soothing
,
in
the
Admiral
's
situation
in
life
,
which
was
just
high
enough
,
and
not
too
high
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
let
my
house
to
Admiral
Croft
,
"
would
sound
extremely
well
;
very
much
better
than
to
any
mere
<EOS>
Mr
 
;
a
Mr
(
save
,
perhaps
,
some
half
dozen
in
the
nation
,
)
always
needs
a
note
of
explanation
.
<EOS>
An
admiral
speaks
his
own
consequence
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
can
never
make
a
baronet
look
small
.
<EOS>
In
all
their
dealings
and
intercourse
,
Sir
Walter
Elliot
must
ever
have
the
precedence
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
done
without
a
reference
to
Elizabeth
:
but
her
inclination
was
growing
so
strong
for
a
removal
,
that
she
was
happy
to
have
it
fixed
and
expedited
by
a
tenant
at
hand
;
and
not
a
word
to
suspend
decision
was
uttered
by
her
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Shepherd
was
completely
empowered
to
act
;
and
no
sooner
had
such
an
end
been
reached
,
than
Anne
,
who
had
been
a
most
attentive
listener
to
the
whole
,
left
the
room
,
to
seek
the
comfort
of
cool
air
for
her
flushed
cheeks
;
and
as
she
walked
along
a
favourite
grove
,
said
,
with
a
gentle
sigh
,
"
A
few
months
more
,
and
he
,
perhaps
,
may
be
walking
here
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
He
was
not
Mr
Wentworth
,
the
former
curate
of
Monkford
,
however
suspicious
appearances
may
be
,
but
a
Captain
Frederick
Wentworth
,
his
brother
,
who
being
made
commander
in
consequence
of
the
action
off
St
Domingo
,
and
not
immediately
employed
,
had
come
into
Somersetshire
,
in
the
summer
of
1806
;
and
having
no
parent
living
,
found
a
home
for
half
a
year
at
Monkford
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
at
that
time
,
a
remarkably
fine
young
man
,
with
a
great
deal
of
intelligence
,
spirit
,
and
brilliancy
;
and
Anne
an
extremely
pretty
girl
,
with
gentleness
,
modesty
,
taste
,
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
Half
the
sum
of
attraction
,
on
either
side
,
might
have
been
enough
,
for
he
had
nothing
to
do
,
and
she
had
hardly
anybody
to
love
;
but
the
encounter
of
such
lavish
recommendations
could
not
fail
.
<EOS>
They
were
gradually
acquainted
,
and
when
acquainted
,
rapidly
and
deeply
in
love
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
had
seen
highest
perfection
in
the
other
,
or
which
had
been
the
happiest
:
<EOS>
she
,
in
receiving
his
declarations
and
proposals
,
or
he
in
having
them
accepted
.
  
<EOS>
A
short
period
of
exquisite
felicity
followed
,
and
but
a
short
one
.
<EOS>
Troubles
soon
arose
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
on
being
applied
to
,
without
actually
withholding
his
consent
,
or
saying
it
should
never
be
,
gave
it
all
the
negative
of
great
astonishment
,
great
coldness
,
great
silence
,
and
a
professed
resolution
of
doing
nothing
for
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
He
thought
it
a
very
degrading
alliance
;
and
Lady
Russell
,
though
with
more
tempered
and
pardonable
pride
,
received
it
as
a
most
unfortunate
one
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
Elliot
,
with
all
her
claims
of
birth
,
beauty
,
and
mind
,
to
throw
herself
away
at
nineteen
;
involve
herself
at
nineteen
in
an
engagement
with
a
young
man
,
who
had
nothing
but
himself
to
recommend
him
,
and
no
hopes
of
attaining
affluence
,
but
in
the
chances
of
a
most
uncertain
profession
,
and
no
connexions
to
secure
even
his
farther
rise
in
the
profession
,
would
be
,
indeed
,
a
throwing
away
,
which
she
grieved
to
think
of
!
<EOS>
Anne
Elliot
,
so
young
;
known
to
so
few
,
to
be
snatched
off
by
a
stranger
without
alliance
or
fortune
;
or
rather
sunk
by
him
into
a
state
of
most
wearing
,
anxious
,
youth
-
killing
dependence
!
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
,
if
by
any
fair
interference
of
friendship
,
any
representations
from
one
who
had
almost
a
mother
's
love
,
and
mother
's
rights
,
it
would
be
prevented
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
had
no
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
lucky
in
his
profession
;
but
spending
freely
,
what
had
come
freely
,
had
realized
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
confident
that
he
should
soon
be
rich
:
full
of
life
and
ardour
<EOS>
,
he
knew
that
he
should
soon
have
a
ship
,
and
soon
be
on
a
station
that
would
lead
to
everything
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
been
lucky
;
he
knew
he
should
be
so
still
.
<EOS>
Such
confidence
,
powerful
in
its
own
warmth
,
and
bewitching
in
the
wit
which
often
expressed
it
,
must
have
been
enough
for
Anne
;
but
Lady
Russell
saw
it
very
differently
.
<EOS>
His
sanguine
temper
,
and
fearlessness
of
mind
,
operated
very
differently
on
her
.
<EOS>
She
saw
in
it
but
an
aggravation
of
the
evil
.
<EOS>
It
only
added
a
dangerous
character
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
brilliant
,
he
was
headstrong
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
had
little
taste
for
wit
,
and
of
anything
approaching
to
imprudence
a
horror
.
<EOS>
She
deprecated
the
connexion
in
every
light
.
  
<EOS>
Such
opposition
,
as
these
feelings
produced
,
was
more
than
Anne
could
combat
.
<EOS>
Young
and
gentle
as
she
was
,
it
might
yet
have
been
possible
to
withstand
her
father
's
ill
-
will
,
though
unsoftened
by
one
kind
word
or
look
on
the
part
of
her
sister
;
but
Lady
Russell
,
whom
she
had
always
loved
and
relied
on
,
could
not
,
with
such
steadiness
of
opinion
,
and
such
tenderness
of
manner
,
be
continually
advising
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
was
persuaded
to
believe
the
engagement
a
wrong
thing
:
<EOS>
indiscreet
,
improper
,
hardly
capable
of
success
,
and
not
deserving
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
a
merely
selfish
caution
,
under
which
she
acted
,
in
putting
an
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
Had
she
not
imagined
herself
consulting
his
good
,
even
more
than
her
own
,
she
could
hardly
have
given
him
up
.
<EOS>
The
belief
of
being
prudent
,
and
self
-
denying
,
principally
for
his
advantage
,
was
her
chief
consolation
,
under
the
misery
of
a
parting
,
a
final
parting
;
and
every
consolation
was
required
,
for
she
had
to
encounter
all
the
additional
pain
of
opinions
,
on
his
side
,
totally
unconvinced
and
unbending
,
and
of
his
feeling
himself
<EOS>
ill
used
by
so
forced
a
relinquishment
.
<EOS>
He
had
left
the
country
in
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
months
had
seen
the
beginning
and
the
end
of
their
acquaintance
;
but
not
with
a
few
months
ended
Anne
's
share
of
suffering
from
it
.
<EOS>
Her
attachment
and
regrets
had
,
for
a
long
time
,
clouded
every
enjoyment
of
youth
,
and
an
early
loss
of
bloom
and
spirits
had
been
their
lasting
effect
.
  
<EOS>
More
than
seven
years
were
gone
since
this
little
history
of
sorrowful
interest
had
reached
its
close
;
and
time
had
softened
down
much
,
perhaps
nearly
all
of
peculiar
attachment
to
him
,
but
she
had
been
too
dependent
on
time
alone
;
no
aid
had
been
given
in
change
of
place
(
except
in
one
visit
to
Bath
soon
after
the
rupture
)
,
or
in
any
novelty
or
enlargement
of
society
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
ever
come
within
the
Kellynch
circle
,
who
could
bear
a
comparison
with
Frederick
Wentworth
,
as
he
stood
in
her
memory
.
<EOS>
No
second
attachment
,
the
only
thoroughly
natural
,
happy
,
and
sufficient
cure
,
at
her
time
of
life
,
had
been
possible
to
the
nice
tone
of
her
mind
,
the
fastidiousness
of
her
taste
,
in
the
small
limits
of
the
society
around
them
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
solicited
,
when
about
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
to
change
her
name
,
by
the
young
man
,
who
not
long
afterwards
found
a
more
willing
mind
in
her
younger
sister
;
and
Lady
Russell
had
lamented
her
refusal
;
for
Charles
Musgrove
was
the
eldest
son
of
a
man
,
whose
landed
property
and
general
importance
were
second
in
that
country
,
only
to
Sir
Walter
's
,
and
of
good
character
and
appearance
;
and
however
Lady
Russell
might
have
asked
yet
for
something
more
,
while
Anne
was
nineteen
,
she
would
have
rejoiced
to
see
her
at
twenty
-
two
so
respectably
removed
from
the
partialities
and
injustice
of
her
father
's
house
,
and
settled
so
permanently
near
herself
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
case
,
Anne
had
left
nothing
for
advice
to
do
;
and
though
Lady
Russell
,
as
satisfied
as
ever
with
her
own
discretion
,
never
wished
the
past
undone
,
she
began
now
to
have
the
anxiety
which
borders
on
hopelessness
for
<EOS>
Anne
's
being
tempted
,
by
some
man
of
talents
and
independence
,
to
enter
a
state
for
which
she
held
her
to
be
peculiarly
fitted
by
her
warm
affections
and
domestic
habits
.
  
<EOS>
They
knew
not
each
other
's
opinion
,
either
its
constancy
or
its
change
,
on
the
one
leading
point
of
Anne
's
conduct
,
for
the
subject
was
never
alluded
to
;
but
Anne
,
at
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
thought
very
differently
from
what
she
had
been
made
to
think
at
nineteen
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
blame
Lady
Russell
<EOS>
,
she
did
not
blame
herself
for
having
been
guided
by
her
;
but
she
felt
that
were
any
young
person
,
in
similar
circumstances
,
to
apply
to
her
for
counsel
,
they
would
never
receive
any
of
such
certain
immediate
wretchedness
,
such
uncertain
future
good
.
<EOS>
She
was
persuaded
that
under
every
disadvantage
of
disapprobation
at
home
,
and
every
anxiety
attending
his
profession
,
all
their
probable
fears
,
delays
,
and
disappointments
,
she
should
yet
have
been
a
happier
woman
in
maintaining
the
engagement
,
than
she
had
been
in
the
sacrifice
of
it
;
and
this
,
she
fully
believed
,
had
the
usual
share
,
had
even
more
than
the
usual
share
of
all
such
solicitudes
and
suspense
been
theirs
,
without
reference
to
the
actual
results
of
their
case
,
which
,
as
it
happened
,
would
have
bestowed
earlier
prosperity
than
could
be
reasonably
calculated
on
.
<EOS>
All
his
sanguine
expectations
,
all
his
confidence
had
been
justified
.
<EOS>
His
genius
and
ardour
had
seemed
to
foresee
and
to
command
his
prosperous
path
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
very
soon
after
their
engagement
ceased
,
got
employ
:
and
all
that
he
had
told
her
would
follow
,
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
He
had
distinguished
himself
,
and
early
gained
the
other
step
in
rank
,
and
must
now
,
by
successive
captures
,
have
made
a
handsome
fortune
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
navy
lists
and
newspapers
for
her
authority
,
but
she
could
not
doubt
his
being
rich
;
and
,
in
favour
of
his
constancy
,
she
had
no
reason
to
believe
him
married
.
  
<EOS>
How
eloquent
could
Anne
Elliot
have
been
!
<EOS>
how
eloquent
,
at
least
,
were
her
wishes
on
the
side
of
early
warm
attachment
,
and
a
cheerful
confidence
in
futurity
,
against
that
over
-
anxious
caution
which
seems
to
insult
exertion
and
distrust
Providence
!
<EOS>
She
had
been
forced
into
prudence
in
her
youth
,
she
learned
romance
as
she
grew
older
:
the
natural
sequel
of
an
unnatural
beginning
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
these
circumstances
,
recollections
and
feelings
,
she
could
not
hear
that
Captain
Wentworth
's
sister
was
likely
to
live
at
Kellynch
without
a
revival
of
former
pain
;
and
many
a
stroll
,
and
many
a
sigh
,
were
necessary
to
dispel
the
agitation
of
the
idea
.
<EOS>
She
often
told
herself
it
was
folly
,
before
she
could
harden
her
nerves
sufficiently
to
feel
the
continual
discussion
of
the
Crofts
and
their
business
no
evil
.
<EOS>
She
was
assisted
,
however
,
by
that
perfect
indifference
and
apparent
unconsciousness
,
among
the
only
three
of
her
own
friends
in
the
secret
of
the
past
,
which
seemed
almost
to
deny
any
recollection
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
do
justice
to
the
superiority
of
Lady
Russell
's
motives
in
this
,
over
those
of
her
father
and
Elizabeth
;
she
could
honour
all
the
better
feelings
of
her
calmness
;
but
the
general
air
of
oblivion
among
them
was
highly
important
from
whatever
it
sprung
;
and
in
the
event
of
Admiral
Croft
's
really
taking
Kellynch
Hall
,
she
rejoiced
anew
over
the
conviction
which
had
always
been
most
grateful
to
her
,
of
the
past
being
known
to
those
three
only
among
her
connexions
,
by
whom
no
syllable
,
she
believed
,
would
ever
be
whispered
,
and
in
the
trust
that
among
his
,
the
brother
only
with
whom
he
had
been
residing
,
had
received
any
information
of
their
short
-
lived
engagement
.
<EOS>
That
brother
had
been
long
removed
from
the
country
and
being
a
sensible
man
,
and
,
moreover
,
a
single
man
at
the
time
,
she
had
a
fond
dependence
on
no
human
creature
's
having
heard
of
it
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
sister
,
Mrs
Croft
,
had
then
been
out
of
England
,
accompanying
her
husband
on
a
foreign
station
,
and
her
own
sister
,
Mary
,
had
been
at
school
while
it
all
occurred
;
and
never
admitted
by
the
pride
of
some
,
and
the
delicacy
of
others
,
to
the
smallest
knowledge
of
it
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
With
these
supports
,
she
hoped
that
the
acquaintance
between
herself
and
the
Crofts
,
which
,
with
Lady
Russell
,
still
resident
in
Kellynch
,
and
Mary
fixed
only
three
miles
off
,
must
be
anticipated
,
need
not
involve
any
particular
awkwardness
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
morning
appointed
for
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
's
seeing
Kellynch
Hall
,
Anne
found
it
most
natural
to
take
her
almost
daily
walk
to
Lady
Russell
's
,
and
keep
out
of
the
way
till
all
was
over
;
when
she
found
it
most
natural
to
be
sorry
that
she
had
missed
the
opportunity
of
seeing
them
.
  
<EOS>
This
meeting
of
the
two
parties
proved
highly
satisfactory
,
and
decided
the
whole
business
at
once
.
<EOS>
Each
lady
was
previously
well
disposed
for
an
agreement
,
and
saw
nothing
,
therefore
,
but
good
manners
in
the
other
;
and
with
regard
to
the
gentlemen
,
there
was
such
an
hearty
good
humour
,
such
an
open
,
trusting
liberality
on
the
Admiral
's
side
,
as
could
not
but
influence
Sir
Walter
,
who
had
besides
been
flattered
into
his
very
best
and
most
polished
behaviour
by
Mr
Shepherd
's
assurances
of
his
being
known
,
by
report
,
to
the
Admiral
,
as
a
model
of
good
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
and
grounds
,
and
furniture
,
were
approved
,
the
Crofts
were
approved
,
terms
,
time
,
every
thing
,
and
every
body
,
was
right
;
and
Mr
Shepherd
's
clerks
were
set
to
work
,
without
there
having
been
a
single
preliminary
difference
to
modify
of
all
that
"
This
indenture
sheweth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
without
hesitation
,
declared
the
Admiral
to
be
the
best
-
looking
sailor
he
had
ever
met
with
,
and
went
so
far
as
to
say
,
that
if
his
own
man
might
have
had
the
arranging
of
his
hair
,
he
should
not
be
ashamed
of
being
seen
with
him
any
where
;
and
the
Admiral
,
with
sympathetic
cordiality
,
observed
to
his
wife
as
they
drove
back
through
the
park
,
"
I
thought
we
should
soon
come
to
a
deal
,
my
dear
,
in
spite
of
what
they
told
us
at
Taunton
.
<EOS>
The
Baronet
will
never
set
the
Thames
on
fire
,
but
there
seems
to
be
no
harm
in
him
.
"
 
<EOS>
reciprocal
compliments
,
which
would
have
been
esteemed
about
equal
.
  
<EOS>
The
Crofts
were
to
have
possession
at
Michaelmas
;
and
as
Sir
Walter
proposed
removing
to
Bath
in
the
course
of
the
preceding
month
,
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
in
making
every
dependent
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
,
convinced
that
Anne
would
not
be
allowed
to
be
of
any
use
,
or
any
importance
,
in
the
choice
of
the
house
which
they
were
going
to
secure
,
was
very
unwilling
to
have
her
hurried
away
so
soon
,
and
wanted
to
make
it
possible
for
her
to
stay
behind
till
she
might
convey
her
to
Bath
herself
after
Christmas
;
but
having
engagements
of
her
own
which
must
take
her
from
Kellynch
for
several
weeks
,
she
was
unable
to
give
the
full
invitation
she
wished
,
and
Anne
though
dreading
the
possible
heats
of
September
in
all
the
white
glare
of
Bath
,
and
grieving
to
forego
all
the
influence
so
sweet
and
so
sad
of
the
autumnal
months
in
the
country
,
did
not
think
that
,
everything
considered
,
she
wished
to
remain
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
most
right
,
and
most
wise
,
and
,
therefore
must
involve
least
suffering
to
go
with
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
Something
occurred
,
however
,
to
give
her
a
different
duty
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
often
a
little
unwell
,
and
always
thinking
a
great
deal
of
her
own
complaints
,
and
always
in
the
habit
of
claiming
Anne
when
anything
was
the
matter
,
was
indisposed
;
and
foreseeing
that
she
should
not
have
a
day
's
health
<EOS>
all
the
autumn
,
entreated
,
or
rather
required
her
,
<EOS>
for
it
was
hardly
entreaty
,
to
come
to
Uppercross
Cottage
,
and
bear
her
company
as
long
as
she
should
want
her
,
instead
of
going
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
possibly
do
without
Anne
,
"
was
Mary
's
reasoning
;
and
Elizabeth
's
reply
was
,
"
Then
I
am
sure
Anne
had
better
stay
,
for
nobody
will
want
her
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
be
claimed
as
a
good
,
though
in
an
improper
style
,
is
at
least
better
than
being
rejected
as
no
good
at
all
;
and
Anne
,
glad
to
be
thought
of
some
use
,
glad
to
have
anything
marked
out
as
a
duty
,
and
certainly
not
sorry
to
have
the
scene
of
it
in
the
country
,
and
her
own
dear
country
,
readily
agreed
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
This
invitation
of
Mary
's
removed
all
Lady
Russell
's
difficulties
,
and
it
was
consequently
soon
settled
that
Anne
should
not
go
to
Bath
till
Lady
Russell
took
her
,
and
that
all
the
intervening
time
should
be
divided
between
Uppercross
Cottage
and
Kellynch
Lodge
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
all
was
perfectly
right
;
but
Lady
Russell
was
almost
startled
by
the
wrong
of
one
part
of
the
Kellynch
Hall
plan
,
when
it
burst
on
her
,
which
was
,
Mrs
Clay
's
being
engaged
to
go
to
Bath
with
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
,
as
a
most
important
and
valuable
assistant
to
the
latter
in
all
the
business
before
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
was
extremely
sorry
that
such
a
measure
should
have
been
resorted
to
at
all
,
wondered
,
grieved
,
and
feared
;
and
the
affront
it
contained
to
Anne
,
in
Mrs
Clay
's
being
of
so
much
use
,
while
Anne
could
be
of
none
,
was
a
very
sore
aggravation
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
herself
was
become
hardened
to
such
affronts
;
but
she
felt
the
imprudence
of
the
arrangement
quite
as
keenly
as
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
With
a
great
deal
of
quiet
observation
,
and
a
knowledge
,
which
she
often
wished
less
,
of
her
father
's
character
,
she
was
sensible
that
results
the
most
serious
to
his
family
from
the
intimacy
were
more
than
possible
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
imagine
that
her
father
had
at
present
an
idea
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
had
freckles
,
and
a
projecting
tooth
,
and
a
clumsy
wrist
,
which
he
was
continually
making
severe
remarks
upon
,
in
her
absence
;
but
she
was
young
,
and
certainly
altogether
well
-
looking
,
and
possessed
,
in
an
acute
mind
and
assiduous
pleasing
manners
,
infinitely
more
dangerous
attractions
than
any
merely
personal
might
have
been
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
so
impressed
by
the
degree
of
their
danger
,
that
she
could
not
excuse
herself
from
trying
to
make
it
perceptible
to
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
had
little
hope
of
success
;
but
Elizabeth
,
who
in
the
event
of
such
a
reverse
would
be
so
much
more
to
be
pitied
than
herself
,
should
never
,
she
thought
,
have
reason
to
reproach
her
for
giving
no
warning
.
  
<EOS>
She
spoke
,
and
seemed
only
to
offend
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
could
not
conceive
how
such
an
absurd
suspicion
should
occur
to
her
,
and
indignantly
answered
for
each
party
's
perfectly
knowing
their
situation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Clay
,
"
said
she
,
warmly
,
"
never
forgets
who
she
is
;
and
as
I
am
rather
better
acquainted
with
her
sentiments
than
you
can
be
,
I
can
assure
you
,
that
upon
the
subject
of
marriage
they
are
particularly
nice
,
and
that
she
reprobates
all
inequality
of
condition
and
rank
more
strongly
than
most
people
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
my
father
,
I
really
should
not
have
thought
that
he
,
who
has
kept
himself
single
so
long
for
our
sakes
,
need
be
suspected
now
.
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Clay
were
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
I
grant
you
,
it
might
be
wrong
to
have
her
so
much
with
me
;
not
that
anything
in
the
world
,
I
am
sure
,
would
induce
my
father
to
make
a
degrading
match
,
but
he
might
be
rendered
unhappy
.
<EOS>
But
poor
Mrs
Clay
who
,
with
all
her
merits
,
can
never
have
been
reckoned
tolerably
pretty
<EOS>
,
I
really
think
poor
Mrs
Clay
may
be
staying
here
in
perfect
safety
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
you
had
never
heard
my
father
speak
of
her
personal
misfortunes
,
though
I
know
you
must
fifty
times
.
<EOS>
That
tooth
of
her
's
and
those
freckles
.
<EOS>
Freckles
do
not
disgust
me
so
very
much
as
they
do
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
a
face
not
materially
disfigured
by
a
few
,
but
he
abominates
them
.
<EOS>
You
must
have
heard
him
notice
Mrs
Clay
's
freckles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
hardly
any
personal
defect
,
"
replied
Anne
,
"
which
an
agreeable
manner
might
not
gradually
reconcile
one
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
very
differently
,
"
answered
Elizabeth
,
shortly
;
"
an
agreeable
manner
may
set
off
handsome
features
,
but
can
never
alter
plain
ones
.
<EOS>
However
,
at
any
rate
,
as
I
have
a
great
deal
more
at
stake
on
this
point
than
anybody
else
can
have
,
I
think
it
rather
unnecessary
in
you
to
be
advising
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
done
;
glad
that
it
was
over
,
and
not
absolutely
hopeless
of
doing
good
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
though
resenting
the
suspicion
,
might
yet
be
made
observant
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
office
of
the
four
carriage
-
horses
was
to
draw
Sir
Walter
,
Miss
Elliot
,
and
Mrs
Clay
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
The
party
drove
off
in
very
good
spirits
;
Sir
Walter
prepared
with
condescending
bows
for
all
the
afflicted
tenantry
and
cottagers
who
might
have
had
a
hint
to
show
themselves
,
and
Anne
walked
up
at
the
same
time
,
in
a
sort
of
desolate
tranquillity
,
to
the
Lodge
,
where
she
was
to
spend
the
first
week
.
  
<EOS>
Her
friend
was
not
in
better
spirits
than
herself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
felt
this
break
-
up
of
the
family
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
Their
respectability
was
as
dear
to
her
as
her
own
,
and
a
daily
intercourse
had
become
precious
by
habit
.
<EOS>
It
was
painful
to
look
upon
their
deserted
grounds
,
and
still
worse
to
anticipate
the
new
hands
they
were
to
fall
into
;
and
to
escape
the
solitariness
and
the
melancholy
of
so
altered
a
village
,
and
be
out
of
the
way
when
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
first
arrived
,
she
had
determined
to
make
her
own
absence
from
home
begin
when
she
must
give
up
Anne
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
their
removal
was
made
together
,
and
Anne
was
set
down
at
Uppercross
Cottage
,
in
the
first
stage
of
Lady
Russell
's
journey
.
  
<EOS>
Uppercross
was
a
moderate
-
sized
village
,
which
a
few
years
back
had
been
completely
in
the
old
English
style
,
containing
only
two
houses
superior
in
appearance
to
those
of
the
yeomen
and
labourers
;
<EOS>
the
mansion
of
the
squire
,
with
its
high
walls
,
great
gates
,
and
old
trees
,
substantial
and
unmodernized
,
and
the
compact
,
tight
parsonage
,
enclosed
in
its
own
neat
garden
,
with
a
vine
and
a
pear
-
tree
trained
round
its
casements
;
but
upon
the
marriage
of
the
young
"
squire
,
it
had
received
the
improvement
of
a
farm
-
house
elevated
into
a
cottage
,
for
his
residence
,
and
Uppercross
Cottage
,
with
its
veranda
,
French
windows
,
and
other
prettiness
,
was
quite
as
likely
to
catch
the
traveller
's
eye
as
the
more
consistent
and
considerable
aspect
and
premises
of
the
Great
House
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
.
  
<EOS>
Here
Anne
had
often
been
staying
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
ways
of
Uppercross
as
well
as
those
of
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
The
two
families
were
so
continually
meeting
,
so
much
in
the
habit
of
running
in
and
out
of
each
other
's
house
at
all
hours
,
that
it
was
rather
a
surprise
to
her
to
find
Mary
alone
;
but
being
alone
,
her
being
unwell
and
out
of
spirits
was
almost
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Though
better
endowed
than
the
elder
sister
,
Mary
had
not
Anne
's
understanding
nor
temper
.
<EOS>
While
well
,
and
happy
,
and
properly
attended
to
,
she
had
great
good
humour
and
excellent
spirits
;
but
any
indisposition
sunk
her
completely
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
resources
for
solitude
;
and
inheriting
a
considerable
share
of
the
Elliot
self
-
importance
,
was
very
prone
to
add
to
every
other
distress
that
of
fancying
herself
neglected
and
ill
-
used
.
<EOS>
In
person
,
she
was
inferior
to
both
sisters
,
and
had
,
even
in
her
bloom
,
only
reached
the
dignity
of
being
"
a
fine
girl
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
now
lying
on
the
faded
sofa
of
the
pretty
little
drawing
-
room
,
the
once
elegant
furniture
of
which
had
been
gradually
growing
shabby
,
under
the
influence
of
four
summers
and
two
children
;
and
,
on
Anne
's
appearing
,
greeted
her
with
    
"
<EOS>
So
,
you
are
come
at
last
!
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
I
should
never
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
ill
I
can
hardly
speak
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
a
creature
the
whole
morning
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
you
unwell
,
"
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
You
sent
me
such
a
good
account
of
yourself
on
Thursday
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
made
the
best
of
it
;
I
always
do
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
very
far
from
well
at
the
time
;
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
was
so
ill
in
my
life
as
I
have
been
all
this
morning
:
very
unfit
to
be
left
alone
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
were
to
be
seized
of
a
sudden
in
some
dreadful
way
,
and
not
able
to
ring
the
bell
!
<EOS>
So
,
Lady
Russell
would
not
get
out
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
she
has
been
in
this
house
three
times
this
summer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
said
what
was
proper
,
and
enquired
after
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Charles
is
out
shooting
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
him
since
seven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
,
though
I
told
him
how
ill
I
was
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
should
not
stay
out
long
;
but
he
has
never
come
back
,
and
now
it
is
almost
one
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
I
have
not
seen
a
soul
this
whole
long
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
your
little
boys
with
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
as
long
as
I
could
bear
their
noise
;
but
they
are
so
unmanageable
that
they
do
me
more
harm
than
good
.
<EOS>
Little
Charles
does
not
mind
a
word
I
say
,
and
Walter
is
growing
quite
as
bad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
will
soon
be
better
now
,
"
replied
Anne
,
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
I
always
cure
you
when
I
come
.
<EOS>
How
are
your
neighbours
at
the
Great
House
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
you
no
account
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
one
of
them
to
-
day
,
except
Mr
Musgrove
,
who
just
stopped
and
spoke
through
the
window
,
but
without
getting
off
his
horse
;
and
though
I
told
him
how
ill
I
was
,
<EOS>
not
one
of
them
have
been
near
me
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
happen
to
suit
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
I
suppose
,
and
they
never
put
themselves
out
of
their
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
will
see
them
yet
,
perhaps
,
before
the
morning
is
gone
.
<EOS>
It
is
early
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
want
them
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
They
talk
and
laugh
a
great
deal
too
much
for
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Anne
,
I
am
so
very
unwell
!
<EOS>
It
was
quite
unkind
of
you
not
to
come
on
Thursday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mary
,
recollect
what
a
comfortable
account
<EOS>
you
sent
me
of
yourself
!
<EOS>
You
wrote
in
the
cheerfullest
manner
,
and
said
you
were
perfectly
well
,
and
in
no
hurry
for
me
;
and
that
being
the
case
,
you
must
be
aware
that
my
wish
would
be
to
remain
with
Lady
Russell
to
the
last
:
and
besides
what
I
felt
on
her
account
,
I
have
really
been
so
busy
,
have
had
so
much
to
do
,
that
I
could
not
very
conveniently
have
left
Kellynch
sooner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
what
can
you
possibly
have
to
do
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
great
many
things
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
More
than
I
can
recollect
in
a
moment
;
but
I
can
tell
you
some
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
making
a
duplicate
of
the
catalogue
of
my
father
's
books
and
pictures
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
several
times
in
the
garden
with
Mackenzie
,
trying
to
understand
,
and
make
him
understand
,
which
of
Elizabeth
's
plants
are
for
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
all
my
own
little
concerns
to
arrange
,
books
and
music
to
divide
,
and
all
my
trunks
to
repack
,
from
not
having
understood
in
time
what
was
intended
as
to
the
waggons
:
and
one
thing
I
have
had
to
do
,
Mary
,
of
a
more
trying
nature
:
going
to
almost
every
house
in
the
parish
,
as
a
sort
of
take
-
leave
.
<EOS>
I
was
told
that
they
wished
it
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
things
took
up
a
great
deal
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
well
!
"
<EOS>
and
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
but
you
have
never
asked
me
one
word
about
our
dinner
at
the
Pooles
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
go
then
?
<EOS>
I
have
made
no
enquiries
,
because
I
concluded
you
must
have
been
obliged
to
give
up
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
I
went
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
well
yesterday
;
nothing
at
all
the
matter
with
me
till
this
morning
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
strange
if
I
had
not
gone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
you
were
well
enough
,
and
I
hope
you
had
a
pleasant
party
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
remarkable
.
<EOS>
One
always
knows
beforehand
what
the
dinner
will
be
,
and
who
will
be
there
;
and
it
is
so
very
uncomfortable
not
having
a
carriage
of
one
's
own
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
took
me
,
and
we
were
so
crowded
!
<EOS>
They
are
both
so
very
large
,
and
take
up
so
much
room
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
always
sits
forward
.
<EOS>
So
,
there
was
I
,
crowded
into
the
back
seat
with
Henrietta
and
Louise
;
and
I
think
it
very
likely
that
my
illness
to
-
day
may
be
owing
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
little
further
perseverance
in
patience
and
forced
cheerfulness
on
Anne
's
side
produced
nearly
a
cure
on
Mary
's
.
<EOS>
She
could
soon
sit
upright
on
the
sofa
,
and
began
to
hope
she
might
be
able
to
leave
it
by
dinner
-
time
.
<EOS>
Then
,
forgetting
to
think
of
it
,
she
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
beautifying
a
nosegay
;
then
,
she
ate
her
cold
meat
;
and
then
she
was
well
enough
to
propose
a
little
walk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
shall
we
go
?
"
<EOS>
said
she
,
when
they
were
ready
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
will
not
like
to
call
at
the
Great
House
before
they
have
been
to
see
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
the
smallest
objection
on
that
account
,
"
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
think
of
standing
on
such
ceremony
with
people
<EOS>
I
know
so
well
as
Mrs
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
they
ought
to
call
upon
you
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
feel
what
is
due
to
you
as
my
sister
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
may
as
well
go
and
sit
with
them
a
little
while
,
and
when
we
have
that
over
,
we
can
enjoy
our
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
always
thought
such
a
style
of
intercourse
highly
imprudent
;
but
she
had
ceased
to
endeavour
to
check
it
,
from
believing
that
,
though
there
were
on
each
side
continual
subjects
of
offence
,
neither
family
could
now
do
without
it
.
<EOS>
To
the
Great
House
accordingly
they
went
,
to
sit
the
full
half
hour
in
the
old
-
fashioned
square
parlour
,
with
a
small
carpet
and
shining
floor
,
to
which
the
present
daughters
of
the
house
were
gradually
giving
the
proper
air
of
confusion
by
a
grand
piano
-
forte
and
a
harp
,
flower
-
stands
and
little
tables
placed
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
could
the
originals
of
the
portraits
against
the
wainscot
,
could
the
gentlemen
in
brown
velvet
and
the
ladies
in
blue
satin
have
seen
what
was
going
on
,
have
been
conscious
of
such
an
overthrow
of
all
order
and
neatness
!
<EOS>
The
portraits
themselves
seemed
to
be
staring
in
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
The
Musgroves
,
like
their
houses
,
were
in
a
state
of
alteration
,
perhaps
of
improvement
.
<EOS>
The
father
and
mother
were
in
the
old
English
style
,
and
the
young
people
in
the
new
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
were
a
very
good
sort
of
people
;
friendly
and
hospitable
,
not
much
educated
,
and
not
at
all
elegant
.
<EOS>
Their
children
had
more
modern
minds
and
manners
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
numerous
family
;
but
the
only
two
grown
up
,
excepting
Charles
,
were
Henrietta
and
Louisa
,
young
ladies
of
nineteen
and
twenty
,
who
had
brought
from
school
at
Exeter
all
the
usual
stock
of
accomplishments
,
and
were
now
like
thousands
of
other
young
ladies
,
living
to
be
fashionable
,
happy
,
and
merry
.
<EOS>
Their
dress
had
every
advantage
,
their
faces
were
rather
pretty
,
their
spirits
extremely
good
,
their
manner
unembarrassed
and
pleasant
;
they
were
of
consequence
at
home
,
and
favourites
abroad
.
<EOS>
Anne
always
contemplated
them
as
some
of
the
happiest
creatures
of
her
acquaintance
;
but
still
,
saved
as
we
all
are
,
by
some
comfortable
feeling
of
superiority
from
wishing
for
the
possibility
of
exchange
,
she
would
not
have
given
up
her
own
more
elegant
and
cultivated
mind
for
all
their
enjoyments
;
and
envied
them
nothing
but
that
seemingly
perfect
good
understanding
and
agreement
together
,
that
good
-
humoured
mutual
affection
,
of
which
she
had
known
so
little
herself
with
either
of
her
sisters
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
received
with
great
cordiality
.
<EOS>
Nothing
seemed
amiss
on
the
side
of
the
Great
House
family
,
which
was
generally
,
as
Anne
very
well
knew
,
the
least
to
blame
.
<EOS>
The
half
hour
was
chatted
away
pleasantly
enough
;
and
she
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
the
end
of
it
,
to
have
their
walking
party
joined
by
both
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
at
Mary
's
particular
invitation
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
had
not
wanted
this
visit
to
Uppercross
,
to
learn
that
a
removal
from
one
set
of
people
to
another
,
though
at
a
distance
of
only
three
miles
,
will
often
include
a
total
change
of
conversation
,
opinion
,
and
idea
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
staying
there
before
,
without
being
struck
by
it
,
or
without
wishing
that
other
Elliots
could
have
her
advantage
in
seeing
how
unknown
,
or
unconsidered
there
,
were
the
affairs
which
at
Kellynch
Hall
were
treated
as
of
such
general
publicity
and
pervading
interest
;
yet
,
with
all
this
experience
,
she
believed
she
must
now
submit
to
feel
that
another
lesson
,
in
the
art
of
knowing
our
own
nothingness
beyond
our
own
circle
,
was
become
necessary
for
her
;
for
certainly
,
coming
as
she
did
,
with
a
heart
full
of
the
subject
which
had
been
completely
occupying
both
houses
in
Kellynch
for
many
weeks
,
she
had
expected
rather
more
curiosity
and
sympathy
than
she
found
in
the
separate
but
very
similar
remark
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
:
"
So
,
Miss
Anne
,
Sir
Walter
and
your
sister
are
gone
;
and
what
part
of
Bath
do
you
think
they
will
settle
in
?
"
<EOS>
and
this
,
without
much
waiting
for
an
answer
;
or
in
the
young
ladies
'
addition
of
,
"
I
hope
we
shall
be
in
Bath
in
the
winter
;
but
remember
,
papa
,
if
we
do
go
,
we
must
be
in
a
good
situation
:
none
of
your
Queen
Squares
for
us
!
"
<EOS>
or
in
the
anxious
supplement
from
Mary
,
of
 
"
Upon
my
word
,
I
shall
be
pretty
well
off
,
when
you
are
all
gone
away
to
be
happy
at
Bath
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
only
resolve
to
avoid
such
self
-
delusion
in
future
,
and
think
with
heightened
gratitude
of
the
extraordinary
blessing
of
having
one
such
truly
sympathising
friend
as
Lady
Russell
.
  
<EOS>
The
Mr
Musgroves
had
their
own
game
to
guard
,
and
to
destroy
,
their
own
horses
,
dogs
,
and
newspapers
to
engage
them
,
and
the
females
were
fully
occupied
in
all
the
other
common
subjects
of
housekeeping
,
neighbours
,
dress
,
dancing
,
and
music
.
<EOS>
She
acknowledged
it
to
be
very
fitting
,
that
every
little
social
commonwealth
should
dictate
its
own
matters
of
discourse
;
and
hoped
,
ere
long
,
to
become
a
not
unworthy
member
of
the
one
she
was
now
transplanted
into
.
<EOS>
With
the
prospect
of
spending
at
least
two
months
at
Uppercross
,
it
was
highly
incumbent
on
her
to
clothe
her
imagination
,
her
memory
,
and
all
her
ideas
in
as
much
of
Uppercross
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
dread
of
these
two
months
.
<EOS>
Mary
was
not
so
repulsive
and
unsisterly
as
Elizabeth
,
nor
so
inaccessible
to
all
influence
of
hers
;
neither
was
there
anything
among
the
other
component
parts
of
the
cottage
inimical
to
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
was
always
on
friendly
terms
with
her
brother
-
in
-
law
;
and
in
the
children
,
who
loved
her
nearly
as
well
,
and
respected
her
a
great
deal
more
than
their
mother
,
she
had
an
object
of
interest
,
amusement
,
and
wholesome
exertion
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Musgrove
was
civil
and
agreeable
;
in
sense
and
temper
he
was
undoubtedly
superior
to
his
wife
,
but
not
of
powers
,
or
conversation
,
or
grace
,
to
make
the
past
,
as
they
were
connected
together
,
at
all
a
dangerous
contemplation
;
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
Anne
could
believe
,
with
Lady
Russell
,
that
a
more
equal
match
might
have
greatly
improved
him
;
and
that
a
woman
of
real
understanding
might
have
given
more
consequence
to
his
character
,
and
more
usefulness
,
rationality
,
and
elegance
to
his
habits
and
pursuits
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
did
nothing
with
much
zeal
,
but
sport
;
and
his
time
was
otherwise
trifled
away
,
without
benefit
from
books
or
anything
else
.
<EOS>
He
had
very
good
spirits
,
which
never
seemed
much
affected
by
his
wife
's
occasional
lowness
,
bore
with
her
unreasonableness
sometimes
to
Anne
's
admiration
,
and
upon
the
whole
,
though
there
was
very
often
a
little
disagreement
(
in
which
she
had
sometimes
more
share
than
she
wished
,
being
appealed
to
by
both
parties
)
,
they
might
pass
for
a
happy
couple
.
<EOS>
They
were
always
perfectly
agreed
in
the
want
of
more
money
,
and
a
strong
inclination
for
a
handsome
present
from
his
father
;
but
here
,
as
on
most
topics
,
he
had
the
superiority
,
for
while
Mary
thought
it
a
great
shame
that
such
a
present
was
not
made
,
he
always
contended
for
his
father
's
having
many
other
uses
for
his
money
,
and
a
right
to
spend
it
as
he
liked
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
management
of
their
children
,
his
theory
was
much
better
than
his
wife
's
,
and
his
practice
not
so
bad
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
manage
them
very
well
,
if
it
were
not
for
Mary
's
interference
,
"
was
what
Anne
often
heard
him
say
,
and
had
a
good
deal
of
faith
in
;
but
when
listening
in
turn
to
Mary
's
reproach
of
"
Charles
spoils
the
children
so
that
I
can
not
get
them
into
any
order
,
"
she
never
had
the
smallest
temptation
to
say
,
"
Very
true
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
least
agreeable
circumstances
of
her
residence
<EOS>
there
was
her
being
treated
with
too
much
confidence
by
all
parties
,
and
being
too
much
in
the
secret
of
the
complaints
of
each
house
.
<EOS>
Known
to
have
some
influence
with
her
sister
,
she
was
continually
requested
,
or
at
least
receiving
hints
to
exert
it
,
beyond
what
was
practicable
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
could
persuade
Mary
not
to
be
always
fancying
herself
ill
,
"
was
Charles
's
language
;
and
,
in
an
unhappy
mood
,
thus
spoke
Mary
:
"
I
do
believe
if
Charles
were
to
see
me
dying
,
he
would
not
think
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
,
Anne
,
if
you
would
,
you
might
persuade
him
that
I
really
am
very
ill
 
<EOS>
a
great
deal
worse
than
I
ever
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
declaration
was
,
"
I
hate
sending
the
children
to
the
Great
House
,
though
their
grandmamma
is
always
wanting
to
see
them
,
for
she
humours
and
indulges
them
to
such
a
degree
,
and
gives
them
so
much
trash
and
sweet
things
,
that
they
are
sure
to
come
back
sick
and
cross
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
"
<EOS>
And
Mrs
Musgrove
took
the
first
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
Anne
,
to
say
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
,
I
can
not
help
wishing
Mrs
Charles
had
a
little
of
your
method
with
those
children
.
<EOS>
They
are
quite
different
creatures
with
you
!
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
,
in
general
they
are
so
spoilt
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
pity
you
can
not
put
your
sister
in
the
way
of
managing
them
.
<EOS>
They
are
as
fine
healthy
children
as
ever
were
seen
,
poor
little
dears
!
<EOS>
without
partiality
;
but
Mrs
Charles
knows
no
more
how
they
should
be
treated
 
!
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
troublesome
they
are
sometimes
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Miss
Anne
,
it
prevents
my
wishing
to
see
them
at
our
house
so
often
as
I
otherwise
should
.
<EOS>
I
believe
Mrs
Charles
is
not
quite
pleased
with
my
not
inviting
them
oftener
;
but
you
know
it
is
very
bad
to
have
children
with
one
that
one
is
obligated
to
be
checking
every
moment
;
"
do
n't
do
this
,
"
and
"
do
n't
do
that
;
"
or
that
one
can
only
keep
in
tolerable
order
by
more
cake
than
is
good
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
this
communication
,
moreover
,
from
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
thinks
all
her
servants
so
steady
,
that
it
would
be
high
treason
to
call
it
in
question
;
but
I
am
sure
,
without
exaggeration
,
that
her
upper
house
-
maid
and
laundry
-
maid
,
instead
of
being
in
their
business
,
are
gadding
about
the
village
,
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
I
meet
them
wherever
I
go
;
and
I
declare
,
I
never
go
twice
into
my
nursery
without
seeing
something
of
them
.
<EOS>
If
Jemima
were
not
the
trustiest
,
steadiest
creature
in
the
world
,
it
would
be
enough
to
spoil
her
;
for
she
tells
me
,
they
are
always
tempting
her
to
take
a
walk
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
And
on
Mrs
Musgrove
's
side
,
it
was
,
"
I
make
a
rule
of
never
interfering
in
any
of
my
daughter
-
in
-
law
's
concerns
,
for
I
know
it
would
not
do
;
but
I
shall
tell
you
,
Miss
Anne
,
because
you
may
be
able
to
set
things
to
rights
,
that
I
have
no
very
good
opinion
of
Mrs
Charles
's
nursery
-
maid
:
I
hear
strange
stories
of
her
;
she
is
always
upon
the
gad
;
and
from
my
own
knowledge
,
I
can
declare
,
she
is
such
a
fine
-
dressing
lady
,
that
she
is
enough
to
ruin
any
servants
she
comes
near
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Charles
quite
swears
by
her
,
I
know
<EOS>
;
but
I
just
give
you
this
hint
,
that
you
may
be
upon
the
watch
;
because
,
if
you
see
anything
amiss
,
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
mentioning
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Again
,
it
was
Mary
's
complaint
,
that
Mrs
Musgrove
was
very
apt
not
to
give
her
the
precedence
that
was
her
due
,
when
they
dined
at
the
Great
House
with
other
families
;
and
she
did
not
see
any
reason
why
she
was
to
be
considered
so
much
at
home
as
to
lose
her
place
.
<EOS>
And
one
day
when
Anne
was
walking
with
only
the
Musgroves
,
one
of
them
after
talking
of
rank
,
people
of
rank
,
and
jealousy
of
rank
,
said
,
"
I
have
no
scruple
of
observing
to
you
,
how
nonsensical
some
persons
are
about
their
place
,
because
all
the
world
knows
how
easy
and
indifferent
you
are
about
it
;
but
I
wish
anybody
could
give
Mary
a
hint
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
if
she
were
not
so
very
tenacious
,
especially
if
she
would
not
be
always
putting
herself
forward
to
take
place
of
mamma
.
<EOS>
Nobody
doubts
her
right
to
have
precedence
of
mamma
,
but
it
would
be
more
becoming
in
her
not
to
be
always
insisting
on
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
mamma
cares
about
it
the
least
in
the
world
,
but
I
know
it
is
taken
notice
of
by
many
persons
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
How
was
Anne
to
set
all
these
matters
to
rights
?
<EOS>
She
could
do
little
more
than
listen
patiently
,
soften
every
grievance
,
and
excuse
each
to
the
other
;
give
them
all
hints
of
the
forbearance
necessary
between
such
near
neighbours
,
and
make
those
hints
broadest
which
were
meant
for
her
sister
's
benefit
.
  
<EOS>
In
all
other
respects
,
her
visit
began
and
proceeded
very
well
.
<EOS>
Her
own
spirits
improved
by
change
of
place
and
subject
,
by
being
removed
three
miles
from
Kellynch
;
Mary
's
ailments
lessened
by
having
a
constant
companion
,
and
their
daily
intercourse
with
the
other
family
,
since
there
was
neither
superior
affection
,
confidence
,
nor
employment
in
the
cottage
,
to
be
interrupted
by
it
,
was
rather
an
advantage
.
<EOS>
It
was
certainly
carried
nearly
as
far
as
possible
,
for
they
met
every
morning
,
and
hardly
ever
spent
an
evening
asunder
;
but
she
believed
they
should
not
have
done
so
well
without
the
sight
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
respectable
forms
in
the
usual
places
,
or
without
the
talking
,
laughing
,
and
singing
of
their
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
She
played
a
great
deal
better
than
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
but
having
no
voice
,
no
knowledge
of
the
harp
,
and
no
fond
parents
,
to
sit
by
and
fancy
themselves
delighted
,
her
performance
was
little
thought
of
,
only
out
of
civility
,
or
to
refresh
the
others
,
as
she
was
well
aware
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
when
she
played
she
was
giving
pleasure
only
to
herself
;
but
this
was
no
new
sensation
.
<EOS>
Excepting
one
short
period
of
her
life
,
she
had
never
,
since
the
age
of
fourteen
,
never
since
the
loss
of
her
dear
mother
,
known
the
happiness
of
being
listened
to
,
or
encouraged
by
any
just
appreciation
or
real
taste
.
<EOS>
In
music
she
had
been
always
used
to
feel
alone
in
the
world
;
and
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
fond
partiality
for
their
own
daughters
'
performance
,
and
total
indifference
to
any
other
person
's
,
gave
her
much
more
pleasure
for
their
sakes
,
than
mortification
for
her
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
at
the
Great
House
was
sometimes
increased
by
other
company
.
<EOS>
The
neighbourhood
was
not
large
,
but
the
Musgroves
were
visited
by
everybody
,
and
had
more
dinner
-
parties
,
and
more
callers
,
more
visitors
by
invitation
and
by
chance
,
than
any
other
family
.
<EOS>
They
were
more
completely
popular
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
were
wild
for
dancing
;
and
the
evenings
ended
,
occasionally
,
in
an
unpremeditated
little
ball
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
family
of
cousins
within
a
walk
of
Uppercross
,
in
less
affluent
circumstances
,
who
depended
on
the
Musgroves
for
all
their
pleasures
:
they
would
come
at
any
time
,
and
help
play
at
anything
,
or
dance
anywhere
;
and
Anne
,
very
much
preferring
the
office
of
musician
to
a
more
active
post
,
played
country
dances
to
them
by
the
hour
together
;
a
kindness
which
always
recommended
her
musical
powers
to
the
notice
of
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
more
than
anything
else
,
and
often
drew
this
compliment
;
 
"
Well
done
,
Miss
Anne
!
<EOS>
very
well
done
indeed
!
<EOS>
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
those
little
fingers
of
yours
fly
about
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
passed
the
first
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
Michaelmas
came
;
and
now
Anne
's
heart
must
be
in
Kellynch
again
.
<EOS>
A
beloved
home
made
over
to
others
;
all
the
precious
rooms
and
furniture
,
groves
,
and
prospects
,
beginning
to
own
other
eyes
and
other
limbs
!
<EOS>
She
could
not
think
of
much
else
on
the
29th
of
September
;
and
she
had
this
sympathetic
touch
in
the
evening
from
Mary
,
who
,
on
having
occasion
to
note
down
the
day
of
the
month
,
exclaimed
,
"
Dear
me
,
is
not
this
the
day
the
Crofts
were
to
come
to
Kellynch
?
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
did
not
think
of
it
before
.
<EOS>
How
low
it
makes
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Crofts
took
possession
with
true
naval
alertness
,
and
were
to
be
visited
.
<EOS>
Mary
deplored
the
necessity
for
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
knew
how
much
she
should
suffer
.
<EOS>
She
should
put
it
off
as
long
as
she
could
;
"
but
was
not
easy
till
she
had
talked
Charles
into
driving
her
over
on
an
early
day
,
and
was
in
a
very
animated
,
comfortable
state
of
imaginary
agitation
,
when
she
came
back
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
very
sincerely
rejoiced
in
there
being
no
means
of
her
going
.
<EOS>
She
wished
,
however
to
see
the
Crofts
,
and
was
glad
to
be
within
when
the
visit
was
returned
.
<EOS>
They
came
:
the
master
of
the
house
was
not
at
home
,
but
the
two
sisters
were
together
;
and
as
it
chanced
that
Mrs
Croft
fell
to
the
share
of
Anne
,
while
the
Admiral
sat
by
Mary
,
and
made
himself
very
agreeable
by
his
good
-
humoured
notice
of
her
little
boys
,
she
was
well
able
to
watch
for
a
likeness
,
and
if
it
failed
her
in
the
features
,
to
catch
it
in
the
voice
,
or
in
the
turn
of
sentiment
and
expression
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
,
though
neither
tall
nor
fat
,
had
a
squareness
,
uprightness
,
and
vigour
of
form
,
which
gave
importance
to
her
person
.
<EOS>
She
had
bright
dark
eyes
,
good
teeth
,
and
altogether
an
agreeable
face
;
though
her
reddened
and
weather
-
beaten
complexion
,
the
consequence
of
her
having
been
almost
as
much
at
sea
as
her
husband
,
made
her
seem
to
have
lived
some
years
longer
in
the
world
than
her
real
eight
-
and
-
thirty
.
<EOS>
Her
manners
were
open
,
easy
,
and
decided
,
like
one
who
had
no
distrust
of
herself
,
and
no
doubts
of
what
to
do
;
without
any
approach
to
coarseness
,
however
,
or
any
want
of
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Anne
gave
her
credit
,
indeed
,
for
feelings
of
great
consideration
towards
herself
,
in
all
that
related
to
Kellynch
,
and
it
pleased
her
:
especially
,
as
she
had
satisfied
herself
in
the
very
first
half
minute
,
in
the
instant
even
of
introduction
,
that
there
was
not
the
smallest
symptom
of
any
knowledge
or
suspicion
on
Mrs
Croft
's
side
,
to
give
a
bias
of
any
sort
.
<EOS>
She
was
quite
easy
on
that
head
,
and
consequently
full
of
strength
and
courage
,
till
for
a
moment
electrified
by
Mrs
Croft
's
suddenly
saying
,
    
<EOS>
"
It
was
you
,
and
not
your
sister
,
I
find
,
that
my
brother
had
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
,
when
he
was
in
this
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
hoped
she
had
outlived
the
age
of
blushing
;
but
the
age
of
emotion
she
certainly
had
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
may
not
have
heard
that
he
is
married
?
"
added
Mrs
Croft
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
now
answer
as
she
ought
;
and
was
happy
to
feel
,
when
Mrs
Croft
's
next
words
explained
it
to
be
Mr
Wentworth
of
whom
she
spoke
,
that
she
had
said
nothing
which
might
not
do
for
either
brother
.
<EOS>
She
immediately
felt
how
reasonable
it
was
,
that
Mrs
Croft
should
be
thinking
and
speaking
of
Edward
,
and
not
of
Frederick
;
and
with
shame
at
her
own
forgetfulness
applied
herself
to
the
knowledge
of
their
former
neighbour
's
present
state
with
proper
interest
.
  
<EOS>
The
rest
was
all
tranquillity
;
till
,
just
as
they
were
moving
,
she
heard
the
Admiral
say
to
Mary
    
<EOS>
"
We
are
expecting
a
brother
of
Mrs
Croft
's
here
soon
;
I
dare
say
you
know
him
by
name
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
cut
short
by
the
eager
attacks
of
the
little
boys
,
clinging
to
him
like
an
old
friend
,
and
declaring
he
should
not
go
;
and
being
too
much
engrossed
by
proposals
of
carrying
them
away
in
his
coat
pockets
,
&
c.
,
to
have
another
moment
for
finishing
or
recollecting
what
he
had
begun
,
Anne
was
left
to
persuade
herself
,
as
well
as
she
could
,
that
the
same
brother
must
still
be
in
question
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
,
however
,
reach
such
a
degree
of
certainty
,
as
not
to
be
anxious
to
hear
whether
anything
had
been
said
on
the
subject
at
the
other
house
,
where
the
Crofts
had
previously
been
calling
.
  
<EOS>
The
folks
of
the
Great
House
were
to
spend
the
evening
of
this
day
at
the
Cottage
;
and
it
being
now
too
late
in
the
year
for
such
visits
to
be
made
on
foot
,
the
coach
was
beginning
to
be
listened
for
,
when
the
youngest
Miss
Musgrove
walked
in
.
<EOS>
That
she
was
coming
to
apologize
,
and
that
they
should
have
to
spend
the
evening
by
themselves
,
was
the
first
black
idea
;
and
Mary
was
quite
ready
to
be
affronted
,
when
Louisa
made
all
right
by
saying
,
that
she
only
came
on
foot
,
to
leave
more
room
for
the
harp
,
which
was
bringing
in
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
tell
you
our
reason
,
"
she
added
,
"
and
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
on
to
give
you
notice
,
that
papa
and
mamma
are
out
of
spirits
this
evening
,
especially
mamma
;
she
is
thinking
so
much
of
poor
Richard
!
<EOS>
And
we
agreed
it
would
be
best
to
have
the
harp
,
for
it
seems
to
amuse
her
more
than
the
piano
-
forte
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
why
she
is
out
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
When
the
Crofts
called
this
morning
,
(
they
called
here
afterwards
,
did
not
they
?
)
,
they
happened
to
say
,
that
her
brother
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
is
just
returned
to
England
,
or
paid
off
,
or
something
,
and
is
coming
to
see
them
almost
directly
;
and
most
unluckily
it
came
into
mamma
's
head
,
when
they
were
gone
,
that
Wentworth
,
or
something
very
like
it
,
was
the
name
of
poor
Richard
's
captain
at
one
time
;
I
do
not
know
when
or
where
,
but
a
great
while
before
he
died
,
poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
And
upon
looking
over
his
letters
and
things
,
she
found
it
was
so
,
and
is
perfectly
sure
that
this
must
be
the
very
man
,
and
her
head
is
quite
full
of
it
,
and
of
poor
Richard
!
<EOS>
So
we
must
be
as
merry
as
we
can
,
that
she
may
not
be
dwelling
upon
such
gloomy
things
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
real
circumstances
of
this
pathetic
piece
of
family
history
were
,
that
the
Musgroves
had
had
the
ill
fortune
of
a
very
troublesome
,
hopeless
son
;
and
the
good
fortune
to
lose
him
before
he
reached
his
twentieth
year
;
that
he
had
been
sent
to
sea
because
he
was
stupid
and
unmanageable
on
shore
;
that
he
had
been
very
little
cared
for
at
any
time
by
his
family
,
though
quite
as
much
as
he
deserved
;
seldom
heard
of
,
and
scarcely
at
all
regretted
,
when
the
intelligence
of
his
death
abroad
had
worked
its
way
to
Uppercross
,
two
years
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
,
in
fact
,
though
his
sisters
were
now
doing
all
they
could
for
him
,
by
calling
him
"
poor
Richard
,
"
been
nothing
better
than
a
thick
-
headed
,
unfeeling
,
unprofitable
Dick
Musgrove
,
who
had
never
done
anything
to
entitle
himself
to
more
than
the
abbreviation
of
his
name
,
living
or
dead
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
several
years
at
sea
,
and
had
,
in
the
course
of
those
removals
to
which
all
midshipmen
are
liable
,
and
especially
such
midshipmen
as
every
captain
wishes
to
get
rid
of
,
been
six
months
on
board
Captain
Frederick
Wentworth
's
frigate
,
the
Laconia
;
and
from
the
Laconia
he
had
,
under
the
influence
of
his
captain
,
written
the
only
two
letters
which
his
father
and
mother
had
ever
received
from
him
during
the
whole
of
his
absence
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
only
two
disinterested
letters
;
all
the
rest
had
been
mere
applications
for
money
.
  
<EOS>
In
each
letter
he
had
spoken
well
of
his
captain
;
but
yet
,
so
little
were
they
in
the
habit
of
attending
to
such
matters
,
<EOS>
so
unobservant
and
incurious
were
they
as
to
the
names
of
men
or
ships
,
that
it
had
made
scarcely
any
impression
at
the
time
;
and
that
Mrs
Musgrove
should
have
been
suddenly
struck
,
this
very
day
,
with
a
recollection
of
the
name
of
Wentworth
,
as
connected
with
her
son
,
seemed
one
of
those
extraordinary
bursts
of
mind
which
do
sometimes
occur
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
gone
to
her
letters
,
and
found
it
all
as
she
supposed
;
and
the
re
-
perusal
of
these
letters
,
after
so
long
an
interval
,
her
poor
son
gone
for
ever
,
and
all
the
strength
of
his
faults
forgotten
,
had
affected
her
spirits
exceedingly
,
and
thrown
her
into
greater
grief
for
him
than
she
had
known
on
first
hearing
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
Mr
Musgrove
was
,
in
a
lesser
degree
,
affected
likewise
;
and
when
they
reached
the
cottage
,
they
were
evidently
in
want
,
first
,
of
being
listened
to
anew
on
this
subject
,
and
afterwards
,
of
all
the
relief
which
cheerful
companions
could
give
them
.
  
<EOS>
To
hear
them
talking
so
much
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
repeating
his
name
so
often
,
puzzling
over
past
years
,
and
at
last
ascertaining
that
it
might
,
that
it
probably
would
,
turn
out
to
be
the
very
same
Captain
Wentworth
whom
they
recollected
meeting
,
once
or
twice
,
after
their
coming
back
from
Clifton
 
<EOS>
a
very
fine
young
man
 
<EOS>
but
they
could
not
say
whether
it
was
seven
or
eight
years
ago
<EOS>
,
was
a
new
sort
of
trial
to
Anne
's
nerves
.
<EOS>
She
found
,
however
,
that
it
was
one
to
which
she
must
inure
herself
.
<EOS>
Since
he
actually
was
expected
in
the
country
,
she
must
teach
herself
to
be
insensible
on
such
points
.
<EOS>
And
not
only
did
it
appear
that
he
was
expected
,
and
speedily
,
but
the
Musgroves
,
in
their
warm
gratitude
for
the
kindness
he
had
shewn
poor
Dick
,
and
very
high
respect
for
his
character
,
stamped
as
it
was
by
poor
Dick
's
having
been
six
months
under
his
care
,
and
mentioning
him
in
strong
,
though
not
perfectly
well
-
spelt
praise
,
as
"
a
fine
dashing
felow
,
only
two
perticular
about
the
schoolmaster
,
"
were
bent
on
introducing
themselves
,
and
seeking
his
acquaintance
,
as
soon
as
they
could
hear
of
his
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
The
resolution
of
doing
so
helped
to
form
the
comfort
of
their
evening
.
    
<EOS>
A
very
few
days
more
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
was
known
to
be
at
Kellynch
,
and
Mr
Musgrove
had
called
on
him
,
and
come
back
warm
in
his
praise
,
and
he
was
engaged
with
the
Crofts
to
dine
at
Uppercross
,
by
the
end
of
another
week
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
great
disappointment
to
Mr
Musgrove
to
find
that
no
earlier
day
could
be
fixed
,
so
impatient
was
he
to
shew
his
gratitude
,
by
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
under
his
own
roof
,
and
welcoming
him
to
all
that
was
strongest
and
best
in
his
cellars
.
<EOS>
But
a
week
must
pass
;
only
a
week
,
in
Anne
's
reckoning
,
and
then
,
she
supposed
,
they
must
meet
;
and
soon
she
began
to
wish
that
she
could
feel
secure
even
for
a
week
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
made
a
very
early
return
to
Mr
Musgrove
's
civility
,
and
she
was
all
but
calling
there
in
the
same
half
hour
.
<EOS>
She
and
Mary
were
actually
setting
forward
for
the
Great
House
,
where
,
as
she
afterwards
learnt
,
they
must
inevitably
have
found
him
,
when
they
were
stopped
by
the
eldest
boy
's
being
at
that
moment
brought
home
in
consequence
of
a
bad
fall
.
<EOS>
The
child
's
situation
put
the
visit
entirely
aside
;
but
she
could
not
hear
of
her
escape
with
indifference
,
even
in
the
midst
of
the
serious
anxiety
which
they
afterwards
felt
on
his
account
.
  
<EOS>
His
collar
-
bone
was
found
to
be
dislocated
,
and
such
injury
received
in
the
back
,
as
roused
the
most
alarming
ideas
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
afternoon
of
distress
,
and
Anne
had
every
thing
to
do
at
once
;
the
apothecary
to
send
for
,
the
father
to
have
pursued
and
informed
,
the
mother
to
support
and
keep
from
hysterics
,
the
servants
to
control
,
the
youngest
child
to
banish
,
and
the
poor
suffering
one
to
attend
and
soothe
;
besides
sending
,
as
soon
as
she
recollected
it
,
proper
notice
to
the
other
house
,
which
brought
her
an
accession
rather
of
frightened
,
enquiring
companions
,
than
of
very
useful
assistants
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
's
return
was
the
first
comfort
;
he
could
take
best
care
of
his
wife
;
and
the
second
blessing
was
the
arrival
of
the
apothecary
.
<EOS>
Till
he
came
and
had
examined
the
child
,
their
apprehensions
were
the
worse
for
being
vague
;
they
suspected
great
injury
,
but
knew
not
where
;
but
now
the
collar
-
bone
was
soon
replaced
,
and
though
Mr
Robinson
felt
and
felt
,
and
rubbed
,
and
looked
grave
,
and
spoke
low
words
both
to
the
father
and
the
aunt
,
still
they
were
all
to
hope
the
best
,
and
to
be
able
to
part
and
eat
their
dinner
in
tolerable
ease
of
mind
;
and
then
it
was
,
just
before
they
parted
,
that
the
two
young
aunts
were
able
so
far
to
digress
from
their
nephew
's
state
,
as
to
give
the
information
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
visit
;
staying
five
minutes
behind
their
father
and
mother
,
to
endeavour
to
express
how
perfectly
delighted
they
were
with
him
<EOS>
,
how
much
handsomer
,
how
infinitely
more
agreeable
they
thought
him
than
any
individual
among
their
male
acquaintance
,
who
had
been
at
all
a
favourite
before
.
<EOS>
How
glad
they
had
been
to
hear
papa
invite
him
to
stay
dinner
,
how
sorry
when
he
said
it
was
quite
out
of
his
power
,
and
how
glad
again
when
he
had
promised
in
reply
to
papa
and
mamma
's
farther
pressing
invitations
to
come
and
dine
with
them
on
the
morrow
 
actually
on
the
morrow
;
and
he
had
promised
it
in
so
pleasant
a
manner
,
as
if
he
felt
all
the
motive
of
their
attention
just
as
he
ought
.
<EOS>
And
in
short
,
he
had
looked
and
said
everything
with
such
exquisite
grace
,
that
they
could
assure
them
all
,
their
heads
were
both
turned
by
him
;
and
off
they
ran
,
quite
as
full
of
glee
as
of
love
,
and
apparently
more
full
of
Captain
Wentworth
than
of
little
Charles
.
  
<EOS>
The
same
story
and
the
same
raptures
were
repeated
,
when
the
two
girls
came
with
their
father
,
through
the
gloom
of
the
evening
,
to
make
enquiries
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
,
no
longer
under
the
first
uneasiness
about
his
heir
,
could
add
his
confirmation
and
praise
,
and
hope
there
would
be
now
no
occasion
for
putting
Captain
Wentworth
off
,
and
only
be
sorry
to
think
that
the
cottage
party
,
probably
,
would
not
like
to
leave
the
little
boy
,
to
give
him
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
;
as
to
leaving
the
little
boy
,
"
both
father
and
mother
were
in
much
too
strong
and
recent
alarm
to
bear
the
thought
;
and
Anne
,
in
the
joy
of
the
escape
,
could
not
help
adding
her
warm
protestations
to
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Musgrove
,
indeed
,
afterwards
,
shewed
more
of
inclination
;
"
the
child
was
going
on
so
well
,
and
he
wished
so
much
to
be
introduced
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
that
,
perhaps
,
he
might
join
them
in
the
evening
;
he
would
not
dine
from
home
,
but
he
might
walk
in
for
half
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
But
in
this
he
was
eagerly
opposed
by
his
wife
,
with
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
no
,
indeed
,
Charles
,
I
can
not
bear
to
have
you
go
away
.
<EOS>
Only
think
if
anything
should
happen
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
child
had
a
good
night
,
and
was
going
on
well
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
a
work
of
time
to
ascertain
that
no
injury
had
been
done
to
the
spine
;
but
Mr
Robinson
found
nothing
to
increase
alarm
,
and
Charles
Musgrove
began
,
consequently
,
to
feel
no
necessity
for
longer
confinement
.
<EOS>
The
child
was
to
be
kept
in
bed
and
amused
as
quietly
as
possible
;
but
what
was
there
for
a
father
to
do
?
<EOS>
This
was
quite
a
female
case
,
and
it
would
be
highly
absurd
in
him
,
who
could
be
of
no
use
at
home
,
to
shut
himself
up
.
<EOS>
His
father
very
much
wished
him
to
meet
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
being
no
sufficient
reason
against
it
,
he
ought
to
go
;
and
it
ended
in
his
making
a
bold
,
public
declaration
,
when
he
came
in
from
shooting
,
of
his
meaning
to
dress
directly
,
and
dine
at
the
other
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
can
be
going
on
better
than
the
child
,
"
said
he
;
"
so
I
told
my
father
,
just
now
,
that
I
would
come
,
and
he
thought
me
quite
right
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
being
with
you
,
my
love
,
I
have
no
scruple
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
would
not
like
to
leave
him
yourself
,
but
you
see
I
can
be
of
no
use
.
<EOS>
Anne
will
send
for
me
if
anything
is
the
matter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Husbands
and
wives
generally
understand
when
opposition
will
be
vain
.
<EOS>
Mary
knew
,
from
Charles
's
manner
of
speaking
,
that
he
was
quite
determined
on
going
,
and
that
it
would
be
of
no
use
to
teaze
him
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
,
therefore
,
till
he
was
out
of
the
room
,
but
as
soon
as
there
was
only
Anne
to
hear
    
"
So
you
and
I
are
to
be
left
to
shift
by
ourselves
,
with
this
poor
sick
child
;
and
not
a
creature
coming
near
us
all
the
evening
!
<EOS>
I
knew
how
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
This
is
always
my
luck
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
disagreeable
going
on
men
are
always
sure
to
get
out
of
it
,
and
Charles
is
as
bad
as
any
of
them
.
<EOS>
Very
unfeeling
!
<EOS>
I
must
say
it
is
very
unfeeling
of
him
to
be
running
away
from
his
poor
little
boy
.
<EOS>
Talks
of
his
being
going
on
so
well
!
<EOS>
How
does
he
know
that
he
is
going
on
well
,
or
that
there
may
not
be
a
sudden
change
half
an
hour
hence
?
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
Charles
would
have
been
so
unfeeling
.
<EOS>
So
here
he
is
to
go
away
and
enjoy
himself
,
and
because
I
am
the
poor
mother
,
I
am
not
to
be
allowed
to
stir
;
and
yet
,
I
am
sure
<EOS>
,
I
am
more
unfit
than
anybody
else
to
be
about
the
child
.
<EOS>
My
being
the
mother
is
the
very
reason
why
my
feelings
should
not
be
tried
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
You
saw
how
hysterical
I
was
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
that
was
only
the
effect
of
the
suddenness
of
your
alarm
 
of
the
shock
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
be
hysterical
again
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
we
shall
have
nothing
to
distress
us
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
understand
Mr
Robinson
's
directions
,
and
have
no
fears
;
and
indeed
,
Mary
,
I
can
not
wonder
at
your
husband
.
<EOS>
Nursing
does
not
belong
to
a
man
;
it
is
not
his
province
.
<EOS>
A
sick
child
is
always
the
mother
's
property
:
her
own
feelings
generally
make
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
am
as
fond
of
my
child
as
any
mother
,
but
I
do
not
know
that
I
am
of
any
more
use
in
the
sick
-
room
than
Charles
,
for
I
can
not
be
always
scolding
and
teazing
the
poor
child
when
it
is
ill
;
and
you
saw
,
this
morning
,
that
if
I
told
him
to
keep
quiet
,
he
was
sure
to
begin
kicking
about
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
nerves
for
the
sort
of
thing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
could
you
be
comfortable
yourself
,
to
be
spending
the
whole
evening
away
from
the
poor
boy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
see
his
papa
can
,
and
why
should
not
I
?
<EOS>
Jemima
is
so
careful
;
and
she
could
send
us
word
every
hour
how
he
was
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
Charles
might
as
well
have
told
his
father
we
would
all
come
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
more
alarmed
about
little
Charles
now
than
he
is
.
<EOS>
I
was
dreadfully
alarmed
yesterday
,
but
the
case
is
very
different
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
if
you
do
not
think
it
too
late
to
give
notice
for
yourself
,
suppose
you
were
to
go
,
as
well
as
your
husband
.
<EOS>
Leave
little
Charles
to
my
care
.
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
can
not
think
it
wrong
while
I
remain
with
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
serious
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Mary
,
her
eyes
brightening
.
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
that
's
a
very
good
thought
,
very
good
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
I
may
just
as
well
go
as
not
,
for
I
am
of
no
use
at
home
 
<EOS>
am
I
?
<EOS>
and
it
only
harasses
me
.
<EOS>
You
,
who
have
not
a
mother
's
feelings
,
are
a
great
deal
the
properest
person
.
<EOS>
You
can
make
little
Charles
do
anything
;
he
always
minds
you
at
a
word
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
great
deal
better
than
leaving
him
only
with
Jemima
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
I
shall
certainly
go
;
I
am
sure
I
ought
if
I
can
,
quite
as
much
as
Charles
,
for
they
want
me
excessively
to
be
acquainted
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
I
know
you
do
not
mind
being
left
alone
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
thought
of
yours
,
indeed
,
Anne
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
and
tell
Charles
,
and
get
ready
directly
.
<EOS>
You
can
send
for
us
,
you
know
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
if
anything
is
the
matter
;
but
I
dare
say
there
will
be
nothing
to
alarm
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
go
,
you
may
be
sure
,
if
I
did
not
feel
quite
at
ease
about
my
dear
child
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
moment
she
was
tapping
at
her
husband
's
dressing
-
room
door
,
and
as
Anne
followed
her
up
stairs
,
she
was
in
time
for
the
whole
conversation
,
which
began
with
Mary
's
saying
,
in
a
tone
of
great
exultation
    
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
with
you
,
Charles
,
for
I
am
of
no
more
use
at
home
than
you
are
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
shut
myself
up
for
ever
with
the
child
,
I
should
not
be
able
to
persuade
him
to
do
anything
he
did
not
like
.
<EOS>
Anne
will
stay
;
Anne
undertakes
to
stay
at
home
and
take
care
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
Anne
's
own
proposal
,
and
so
I
shall
go
with
you
,
which
will
be
a
great
deal
better
,
for
I
have
not
dined
at
the
other
house
since
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
very
kind
of
Anne
,
"
was
her
husband
's
answer
,
"
and
I
should
be
very
glad
to
have
you
go
;
but
it
seems
rather
hard
that
she
should
be
left
at
home
by
herself
,
to
nurse
our
sick
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
now
at
hand
to
take
up
her
own
cause
,
and
the
sincerity
of
her
manner
being
soon
sufficient
to
convince
him
,
where
conviction
was
at
least
very
agreeable
,
he
had
no
farther
scruples
as
to
her
being
left
to
dine
alone
,
though
he
still
wanted
her
to
join
them
in
the
evening
,
when
the
child
might
be
at
rest
for
the
night
,
and
kindly
urged
her
to
let
him
come
and
fetch
her
,
but
she
was
quite
unpersuadable
;
and
this
being
the
case
<EOS>
,
she
had
ere
long
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
set
off
together
in
high
spirits
.
<EOS>
They
were
gone
,
she
hoped
,
to
be
happy
<EOS>
,
however
oddly
constructed
such
happiness
might
seem
;
as
for
herself
,
she
was
left
with
as
many
sensations
of
comfort
,
as
were
,
perhaps
,
ever
likely
to
be
hers
.
<EOS>
She
knew
herself
to
be
of
the
first
utility
to
the
child
;
and
what
was
it
to
her
if
Frederick
Wentworth
were
only
half
a
mile
distant
,
making
himself
agreeable
to
others
?
  
<EOS>
She
would
have
liked
to
know
how
he
felt
as
to
a
meeting
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
indifferent
,
if
indifference
could
exist
under
such
circumstances
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
either
indifferent
or
unwilling
.
<EOS>
Had
he
wished
ever
to
see
her
again
,
he
need
not
have
waited
till
this
time
;
he
would
have
done
what
she
could
not
but
believe
that
in
his
place
she
should
have
done
long
ago
,
when
events
had
been
early
giving
him
the
independence
which
alone
had
been
wanting
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
and
sister
came
back
delighted
with
their
new
acquaintance
,
and
their
visit
in
general
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
music
,
singing
,
talking
,
laughing
,
all
that
was
most
agreeable
;
charming
manners
in
Captain
Wentworth
,
no
shyness
or
reserve
;
they
seemed
all
to
know
each
other
perfectly
,
and
he
was
coming
the
very
next
morning
to
shoot
with
Charles
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
come
to
breakfast
,
but
not
at
the
Cottage
,
though
that
had
been
proposed
at
first
;
but
then
he
had
been
pressed
to
come
to
the
Great
House
instead
,
and
he
seemed
afraid
of
being
in
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
's
way
,
on
account
of
the
child
,
and
therefore
,
somehow
,
they
hardly
knew
how
,
it
ended
in
Charles
's
being
to
meet
him
to
breakfast
at
his
father
's
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
understood
it
.
<EOS>
He
wished
to
avoid
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
inquired
after
her
,
she
found
,
slightly
,
as
might
suit
a
former
slight
acquaintance
,
seeming
to
acknowledge
such
as
she
had
acknowledged
,
actuated
,
perhaps
,
by
the
same
view
of
escaping
introduction
when
they
were
to
meet
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
hours
of
the
Cottage
were
always
later
than
those
of
the
other
house
,
and
on
the
morrow
the
difference
was
so
great
that
Mary
and
Anne
were
not
more
than
beginning
breakfast
when
Charles
came
in
to
say
that
they
were
just
setting
off
,
that
he
was
come
for
his
dogs
,
that
his
sisters
were
following
with
Captain
Wentworth
;
his
sisters
meaning
to
visit
Mary
and
the
child
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
proposing
also
to
wait
on
her
for
a
few
minutes
if
not
inconvenient
;
and
though
Charles
had
answered
for
the
child
's
being
in
no
such
state
as
could
make
it
inconvenient
,
Captain
Wentworth
would
not
be
satisfied
without
his
running
on
to
give
notice
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
very
much
gratified
by
this
attention
,
was
delighted
to
receive
him
,
while
a
thousand
feelings
rushed
on
Anne
,
of
which
this
was
the
most
consoling
,
that
it
would
soon
be
over
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
soon
over
.
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
after
Charles
's
preparation
,
the
others
appeared
;
they
were
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Her
eye
half
met
Captain
Wentworth
's
,
a
bow
,
a
curtsey
passed
;
she
heard
his
voice
;
he
talked
to
Mary
,
said
all
that
was
right
,
said
something
to
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
enough
to
mark
an
easy
footing
;
the
room
seemed
full
,
full
of
persons
and
voices
,
but
a
few
minutes
ended
it
.
<EOS>
Charles
shewed
himself
at
the
window
,
all
was
ready
,
their
visitor
had
bowed
and
was
gone
,
the
Miss
Musgroves
were
gone
too
,
suddenly
resolving
to
walk
to
the
end
of
the
village
with
the
sportsmen
:
the
room
was
cleared
,
and
Anne
might
finish
her
breakfast
as
she
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
over
!
<EOS>
it
is
over
!
"
<EOS>
she
repeated
to
herself
again
and
again
,
in
nervous
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
The
worst
is
over
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
talked
,
but
she
could
not
attend
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
him
.
<EOS>
They
had
met
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
once
more
in
the
same
room
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
,
however
,
she
began
to
reason
with
herself
,
and
try
to
be
feeling
less
.
<EOS>
Eight
years
,
almost
eight
years
had
passed
,
since
all
had
been
given
up
.
<EOS>
How
absurd
to
be
resuming
the
agitation
which
such
an
interval
had
banished
into
distance
and
indistinctness
!
<EOS>
What
might
not
eight
years
do
?
<EOS>
Events
of
every
description
,
changes
,
alienations
,
removals
 
all
,
all
must
be
comprised
in
it
,
and
oblivion
of
the
past
  
how
natural
,
how
certain
too
!
<EOS>
It
included
nearly
a
third
part
of
her
own
life
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
with
all
her
reasoning
,
she
found
,
that
to
retentive
feelings
eight
years
may
be
little
more
than
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
how
were
his
sentiments
to
be
read
?
<EOS>
Was
this
like
wishing
to
avoid
her
?
<EOS>
And
the
next
moment
she
was
hating
herself
for
the
folly
which
asked
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
On
one
other
question
which
perhaps
her
utmost
wisdom
might
not
have
prevented
,
she
was
soon
spared
all
suspense
;
for
,
after
the
Miss
Musgroves
had
returned
and
finished
their
visit
at
the
Cottage
she
had
this
spontaneous
information
from
Mary
:
    
<EOS>
"
Captain
Wentworth
is
not
very
gallant
by
you
,
Anne
,
though
he
was
so
attentive
to
me
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
asked
him
what
he
thought
of
you
,
when
they
went
away
,
and
he
said
,
"
You
were
so
altered
he
should
not
have
known
you
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mary
had
no
feelings
to
make
her
respect
her
sister
's
in
a
common
way
,
but
she
was
perfectly
unsuspicious
of
being
inflicting
any
peculiar
wound
.
  
<EOS>
"
Altered
beyond
his
knowledge
.
"
<EOS>
Anne
fully
submitted
,
in
silent
,
deep
mortification
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
it
was
so
,
and
she
could
take
no
revenge
,
for
he
was
not
altered
,
or
not
for
the
worse
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
acknowledged
it
to
herself
,
and
she
could
not
think
differently
,
let
him
think
of
her
as
he
would
.
<EOS>
No
:
<EOS>
the
years
which
had
destroyed
her
youth
and
bloom
had
only
given
him
a
more
glowing
,
manly
,
open
look
,
in
no
respect
lessening
his
personal
advantages
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
the
same
Frederick
Wentworth
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
altered
that
he
should
not
have
known
her
again
!
"
<EOS>
These
were
words
which
could
not
but
dwell
with
her
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
soon
began
to
rejoice
that
she
had
heard
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
of
sobering
tendency
;
they
allayed
agitation
;
they
composed
,
and
consequently
must
make
her
happier
.
  
<EOS>
Frederick
Wentworth
had
used
such
words
,
or
something
like
them
,
but
without
an
idea
that
they
would
be
carried
round
to
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
thought
her
wretchedly
altered
,
and
in
the
first
moment
of
appeal
,
had
spoken
as
he
felt
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
forgiven
Anne
Elliot
.
<EOS>
She
had
used
him
ill
,
deserted
and
disappointed
him
;
and
worse
,
she
had
shewn
a
feebleness
of
character
in
doing
so
,
which
his
own
decided
,
confident
temper
could
not
endure
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
him
up
to
oblige
others
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
the
effect
of
over
-
persuasion
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
weakness
and
timidity
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
most
warmly
attached
to
her
,
and
had
never
seen
a
woman
since
whom
he
thought
her
equal
;
but
,
except
from
some
natural
sensation
of
curiosity
,
he
had
no
desire
of
meeting
her
again
.
<EOS>
Her
power
with
him
was
gone
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
his
object
to
marry
.
<EOS>
He
was
rich
,
and
being
turned
on
shore
,
fully
intended
to
settle
as
soon
as
he
could
be
properly
tempted
;
actually
looking
round
,
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
all
the
speed
which
a
clear
head
and
a
quick
taste
could
allow
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
heart
for
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
if
they
could
catch
it
;
a
heart
,
in
short
,
for
any
pleasing
young
woman
who
came
in
his
way
,
excepting
Anne
Elliot
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
only
secret
exception
,
when
he
said
to
his
sister
,
in
answer
to
her
suppositions
:
    
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
here
I
am
,
Sophia
,
quite
ready
to
make
a
foolish
match
.
<EOS>
Anybody
between
fifteen
and
thirty
may
have
me
for
asking
.
<EOS>
A
little
beauty
,
and
a
few
smiles
,
and
a
few
compliments
to
the
navy
,
and
I
am
a
lost
man
.
<EOS>
Should
not
this
be
enough
for
a
sailor
,
who
has
had
no
society
among
women
to
make
him
nice
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
said
it
,
she
knew
,
to
be
contradicted
.
<EOS>
His
bright
proud
eye
spoke
the
conviction
that
he
was
nice
;
and
Anne
Elliot
was
not
out
of
his
thoughts
,
when
he
more
seriously
described
the
woman
he
should
wish
to
meet
with
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
strong
mind
,
with
sweetness
of
manner
,
"
made
the
first
and
the
last
of
the
description
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
woman
I
want
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Something
a
little
inferior
I
shall
of
course
put
up
with
,
but
it
must
not
be
much
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
a
fool
,
I
shall
be
a
fool
indeed
,
for
I
have
thought
on
the
subject
more
than
most
men
.
"
    
<EOS>
From
this
time
Captain
Wentworth
and
Anne
Elliot
were
repeatedly
in
the
same
circle
.
<EOS>
They
were
soon
dining
in
company
together
at
Mr
Musgrove
's
,
for
the
little
boy
's
state
could
no
longer
supply
his
aunt
with
a
pretence
for
absenting
herself
;
and
this
was
but
the
beginning
of
other
dinings
and
other
meetings
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
former
feelings
were
to
be
renewed
must
be
brought
to
the
proof
;
former
times
must
undoubtedly
be
brought
to
the
recollection
of
each
;
they
could
not
but
be
reverted
to
;
the
year
of
their
engagement
could
not
but
be
named
by
him
,
in
the
little
narratives
or
descriptions
which
conversation
called
forth
.
<EOS>
His
profession
qualified
him
,
his
disposition
lead
him
,
to
talk
;
and
"
That
was
in
the
year
six
;
"
"
That
happened
before
I
went
to
sea
in
the
year
six
,
"
occurred
in
the
course
of
the
first
evening
<EOS>
they
spent
together
:
and
though
his
voice
did
not
falter
,
and
though
she
had
no
reason
to
suppose
his
eye
wandering
towards
her
while
he
spoke
,
Anne
felt
the
utter
impossibility
,
from
her
knowledge
of
his
mind
,
that
he
could
be
unvisited
by
remembrance
any
more
than
herself
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
the
same
immediate
association
of
thought
,
though
she
was
very
far
from
conceiving
it
to
be
of
equal
pain
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
no
conversation
together
,
no
intercourse
but
what
the
commonest
civility
required
.
<EOS>
Once
so
much
to
each
other
!
<EOS>
Now
nothing
!
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
,
when
of
all
the
large
party
now
filling
the
drawing
-
room
at
Uppercross
,
they
would
have
found
it
most
difficult
to
cease
to
speak
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
,
perhaps
,
of
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
,
who
seemed
particularly
attached
and
happy
,
(
Anne
could
allow
no
other
exceptions
even
among
the
married
couples
)
,
there
could
have
been
no
two
hearts
so
open
,
no
tastes
so
similar
,
no
feelings
so
in
unison
,
no
countenances
so
beloved
.
<EOS>
Now
they
were
as
strangers
;
nay
,
worse
than
strangers
,
for
they
could
never
become
acquainted
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
perpetual
estrangement
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
talked
,
she
heard
the
same
voice
,
and
discerned
the
same
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
very
general
ignorance
of
all
naval
matters
throughout
the
party
;
and
he
was
very
much
questioned
,
and
especially
by
the
two
Miss
Musgroves
,
who
seemed
hardly
to
have
any
eyes
but
for
him
,
as
to
the
manner
of
living
on
board
,
daily
regulations
,
food
,
hours
,
&
c.
,
and
their
surprise
at
his
accounts
,
at
learning
the
degree
of
accommodation
and
arrangement
which
was
practicable
,
drew
from
him
some
pleasant
ridicule
,
which
reminded
Anne
of
the
early
days
when
she
too
had
been
ignorant
,
and
she
too
had
been
accused
of
supposing
sailors
to
be
living
on
board
without
anything
to
eat
,
or
any
cook
to
dress
it
if
there
were
,
or
any
servant
to
wait
,
or
any
knife
and
fork
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
From
thus
listening
and
thinking
,
she
was
roused
by
a
whisper
of
Mrs
Musgrove
's
who
,
overcome
by
fond
regrets
,
could
not
help
saying
    
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
,
if
it
had
pleased
Heaven
to
spare
my
poor
son
,
I
dare
say
he
would
have
been
just
such
another
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
suppressed
a
smile
,
and
listened
kindly
,
while
Mrs
Musgrove
relieved
her
heart
a
little
more
;
and
for
a
few
minutes
,
therefore
,
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
conversation
of
the
others
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
could
let
her
attention
take
its
natural
course
again
,
she
found
the
Miss
Musgroves
just
fetching
the
Navy
List
(
their
own
navy
list
,
the
first
that
had
ever
been
at
Uppercross
)
,
and
sitting
down
together
to
pore
over
it
,
with
the
professed
view
of
finding
out
the
ships
that
Captain
Wentworth
had
commanded
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
first
was
the
Asp
,
I
remember
;
we
will
look
for
the
Asp
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
her
there
.
<EOS>
Quite
worn
out
and
broken
up
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
last
man
who
commanded
her
.
<EOS>
Hardly
fit
for
service
then
.
<EOS>
Reported
fit
for
home
service
for
a
year
or
two
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
was
sent
off
to
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
girls
looked
all
amazement
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Admiralty
,
"
he
continued
,
"
entertain
themselves
now
and
then
,
with
sending
a
few
hundred
men
to
sea
,
in
a
ship
not
fit
to
be
employed
.
<EOS>
But
they
have
a
great
many
to
provide
for
;
and
among
the
thousands
that
may
just
as
well
go
to
the
bottom
as
not
,
it
is
impossible
for
them
to
distinguish
the
very
set
who
may
be
least
missed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Phoo
!
phoo
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
Admiral
,
"
what
stuff
these
young
fellows
talk
!
<EOS>
Never
was
a
better
sloop
than
the
Asp
in
her
day
.
<EOS>
For
an
old
built
sloop
,
you
would
not
see
her
equal
.
<EOS>
Lucky
fellow
to
get
her
!
<EOS>
He
knows
there
must
have
been
twenty
better
men
than
himself
applying
for
her
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Lucky
fellow
to
get
anything
so
soon
,
with
no
more
interest
than
his
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
felt
my
luck
,
Admiral
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
;
"
replied
Captain
Wentworth
,
seriously
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
as
well
satisfied
with
my
appointment
as
you
can
desire
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
object
with
me
at
that
time
to
be
at
sea
;
a
very
great
object
,
I
wanted
to
be
doing
something
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
you
did
.
<EOS>
What
should
a
young
fellow
like
you
do
ashore
for
half
a
year
together
?
<EOS>
If
a
man
had
not
a
wife
,
he
soon
wants
to
be
afloat
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
"
cried
Louisa
,
"
how
vexed
you
must
have
been
when
you
came
to
the
Asp
,
to
see
what
an
old
thing
they
had
given
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
pretty
well
what
she
was
before
that
day
;
"
said
he
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
more
discoveries
to
make
than
you
would
have
as
to
the
fashion
and
strength
of
any
old
pelisse
,
which
you
had
seen
lent
about
among
half
your
acquaintance
ever
since
you
could
remember
,
and
which
at
last
,
on
some
very
wet
day
,
is
lent
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
she
was
a
dear
old
Asp
to
me
.
<EOS>
She
did
all
that
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
I
knew
she
would
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
we
should
either
go
to
the
bottom
together
,
or
that
she
would
be
the
making
of
me
;
and
I
never
had
two
days
of
foul
weather
all
the
time
I
was
at
sea
in
her
;
and
after
taking
privateers
enough
to
be
very
entertaining
,
I
had
the
good
luck
in
my
passage
home
the
next
autumn
,
to
fall
in
with
the
very
French
frigate
I
wanted
.
<EOS>
I
brought
her
into
Plymouth
;
and
here
another
instance
of
luck
.
<EOS>
We
had
not
been
six
hours
in
the
Sound
,
when
a
gale
came
on
,
which
lasted
four
days
and
nights
,
and
which
would
have
done
for
poor
old
Asp
in
half
the
time
;
our
touch
with
the
Great
Nation
not
having
much
improved
our
condition
.
<EOS>
Four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
later
,
and
I
should
only
have
been
a
gallant
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
small
paragraph
at
one
corner
of
the
newspapers
;
and
being
lost
in
only
a
sloop
,
nobody
would
have
thought
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
Anne
's
shudderings
were
to
herself
alone
;
but
the
Miss
Musgroves
could
be
as
open
as
they
were
sincere
,
in
their
exclamations
of
pity
and
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
then
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mrs
Musgrove
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
if
thinking
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
so
then
he
went
away
to
the
Laconia
,
and
there
he
met
with
our
poor
boy
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
my
dear
,
"
<EOS>
(
beckoning
him
to
her
)
,
"
do
ask
Captain
Wentworth
where
it
was
he
first
met
with
your
poor
brother
.
<EOS>
I
always
forgot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
at
Gibraltar
,
mother
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
Dick
had
been
left
ill
at
Gibraltar
,
with
a
recommendation
from
his
former
captain
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
but
,
Charles
,
tell
Captain
Wentworth
,
he
need
not
be
afraid
of
mentioning
poor
Dick
before
me
,
for
it
would
be
rather
a
pleasure
to
hear
him
talked
of
by
such
a
good
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
,
being
somewhat
more
mindful
of
the
probabilities
of
the
case
,
only
nodded
in
reply
,
and
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
girls
were
now
hunting
for
the
Laconia
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
taking
the
precious
volume
into
his
own
hands
to
save
them
the
trouble
,
and
once
more
read
aloud
the
little
statement
of
her
name
and
rate
,
and
present
non
-
commissioned
class
,
observing
over
it
that
she
too
had
been
one
of
the
best
friends
man
ever
had
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
those
were
pleasant
days
when
I
had
the
Laconia
!
<EOS>
How
fast
I
made
money
in
her
.
<EOS>
A
friend
of
mine
<EOS>
and
I
had
such
a
lovely
cruise
together
off
the
Western
Islands
.
<EOS>
Poor
Harville
,
sister
!
<EOS>
You
know
how
much
he
wanted
money
:
worse
than
myself
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
wife
.
<EOS>
Excellent
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
felt
it
all
,
so
much
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
I
wished
for
him
again
the
next
summer
,
when
I
had
still
the
same
luck
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
sure
,
Sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Musgrove
,
"
it
was
a
lucky
day
for
us
,
when
you
were
put
captain
into
that
ship
.
<EOS>
We
shall
never
forget
what
you
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
feelings
made
her
speak
low
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
hearing
only
in
part
,
and
probably
not
having
Dick
Musgrove
at
all
near
his
thoughts
,
looked
rather
in
suspense
,
and
as
if
waiting
for
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
,
"
whispered
one
of
the
girls
;
"
mamma
is
thinking
of
poor
Richard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
dear
fellow
!
"
continued
Mrs
Musgrove
;
"
he
was
grown
so
steady
,
and
<EOS>
such
an
excellent
correspondent
,
while
he
was
under
your
care
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
it
would
have
been
a
happy
thing
,
if
he
had
never
left
you
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
we
are
very
sorry
he
ever
left
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
momentary
expression
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
face
at
this
speech
,
a
certain
glance
of
his
bright
eye
,
and
curl
of
his
handsome
mouth
,
which
convinced
Anne
,
that
instead
of
sharing
in
Mrs
Musgrove
's
kind
wishes
,
as
to
her
son
,
he
had
probably
been
at
some
pains
to
get
rid
of
him
;
but
it
was
too
transient
an
indulgence
of
self
-
amusement
to
be
detected
by
any
who
understood
him
less
than
herself
;
in
another
moment
he
was
perfectly
collected
and
serious
,
and
almost
instantly
afterwards
coming
up
to
the
sofa
,
on
which
she
and
Mrs
Musgrove
were
sitting
,
took
a
place
by
the
latter
,
and
entered
into
conversation
with
her
,
in
a
low
voice
,
about
her
son
,
doing
it
with
so
much
sympathy
and
natural
grace
,
as
shewed
the
kindest
consideration
for
all
that
was
real
and
unabsurd
in
the
parent
's
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
actually
on
the
same
sofa
,
for
Mrs
Musgrove
had
most
readily
made
room
for
him
;
they
were
divided
only
by
Mrs
Musgrove
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
insignificant
barrier
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
was
of
a
comfortable
,
substantial
size
,
infinitely
more
fitted
by
nature
to
express
good
cheer
and
good
humour
,
than
tenderness
and
sentiment
;
and
while
the
agitations
of
Anne
's
slender
form
,
and
pensive
face
,
may
be
considered
as
very
completely
screened
,
Captain
Wentworth
should
be
allowed
some
credit
for
the
self
-
command
with
which
he
attended
to
her
large
fat
sighings
over
the
destiny
of
a
son
,
whom
alive
nobody
had
cared
for
.
  
<EOS>
Personal
size
and
mental
sorrow
have
certainly
no
necessary
proportions
.
<EOS>
A
large
bulky
figure
has
as
good
a
right
to
be
in
deep
affliction
,
as
the
most
graceful
set
of
limbs
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
,
fair
or
not
fair
,
there
are
unbecoming
conjunctions
,
which
reason
will
patronize
in
vain
 
which
taste
can
not
tolerate
 
which
ridicule
will
seize
.
  
<EOS>
The
Admiral
,
after
taking
two
or
three
refreshing
turns
about
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
being
called
to
order
by
his
wife
,
now
came
up
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
without
any
observation
of
what
he
might
be
interrupting
,
thinking
only
of
his
own
thoughts
,
began
with
    
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
been
a
week
later
at
Lisbon
,
last
spring
,
Frederick
,
you
would
have
been
asked
to
give
a
passage
to
Lady
Mary
Grierson
and
her
daughters
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Should
I
?
<EOS>
I
am
glad
I
was
not
a
week
later
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
Admiral
abused
him
for
his
want
of
gallantry
.
<EOS>
He
defended
himself
;
though
professing
that
he
would
never
willingly
admit
any
ladies
on
board
a
ship
of
his
,
excepting
for
a
ball
,
or
a
visit
,
which
a
few
hours
might
comprehend
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
if
I
know
myself
,
"
said
he
,
"
this
is
from
no
want
of
gallantry
towards
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
rather
from
feeling
how
impossible
it
is
,
with
all
one
's
efforts
,
and
all
one
's
sacrifices
,
to
make
the
accommodations
on
board
such
as
women
ought
to
have
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
want
of
gallantry
,
Admiral
,
in
rating
the
claims
of
women
to
every
personal
comfort
high
,
and
this
is
what
I
do
.
<EOS>
I
hate
to
hear
of
women
on
board
,
or
to
see
them
on
board
;
and
no
ship
under
my
command
shall
ever
convey
a
family
of
ladies
anywhere
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
brought
his
sister
upon
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Frederick
!
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
believe
it
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
All
idle
refinement
!
 
<EOS>
Women
may
be
as
comfortable
on
board
,
as
in
the
best
house
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
lived
as
much
on
board
as
most
women
,
and
I
know
nothing
superior
to
the
accommodations
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
have
not
a
comfort
or
an
indulgence
about
me
,
even
at
Kellynch
Hall
,
"
(
with
a
kind
bow
to
Anne
)
,
"
beyond
what
I
always
had
in
most
of
the
ships
I
have
lived
in
;
and
they
have
been
five
altogether
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
to
the
purpose
,
"
replied
her
brother
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
living
with
your
husband
,
and
were
the
only
woman
on
board
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
you
,
yourself
,
brought
Mrs
Harville
,
her
sister
,
her
cousin
,
and
three
children
,
round
from
Portsmouth
to
Plymouth
.
<EOS>
Where
was
this
superfine
,
extraordinary
sort
of
gallantry
of
yours
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
merged
in
my
friendship
,
Sophia
.
<EOS>
I
would
assist
any
brother
officer
's
wife
that
I
could
,
and
I
would
bring
anything
of
Harville
's
from
the
world
's
end
,
if
he
wanted
it
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
imagine
that
I
did
not
feel
it
an
evil
in
itself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Depend
upon
it
,
they
were
all
perfectly
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
might
not
like
them
the
better
for
that
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Such
a
number
of
women
and
children
have
no
right
to
be
comfortable
on
board
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Frederick
,
you
are
talking
quite
idly
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
what
would
become
of
us
poor
sailors
'
wives
,
who
often
want
to
be
conveyed
to
one
port
or
another
,
after
our
husbands
,
if
everybody
had
your
feelings
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
feelings
,
you
see
,
did
not
prevent
my
taking
Mrs
Harville
and
all
her
family
to
Plymouth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
hate
to
hear
you
talking
so
like
a
fine
gentleman
,
and
as
if
women
were
all
fine
ladies
,
instead
of
rational
creatures
.
<EOS>
We
none
of
us
expect
to
be
in
smooth
water
all
our
days
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
"
said
the
Admiral
,
"
when
he
had
got
a
wife
,
he
will
sing
a
different
tune
.
<EOS>
When
he
is
married
,
if
we
have
the
good
luck
to
live
to
another
war
,
we
shall
see
him
do
as
you
and
I
,
and
a
great
many
others
,
have
done
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
him
very
thankful
to
anybody
that
will
bring
him
his
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
that
we
shall
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
I
have
done
,
"
cried
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
"
When
once
married
people
begin
to
attack
me
with
,
 
"
Oh
!
you
will
think
very
differently
,
when
you
are
married
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
only
say
,
"
No
,
I
shall
not
;
"
and
then
they
say
again
,
"
Yes
,
you
will
,
"
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
up
and
moved
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
great
traveller
you
must
have
been
,
ma'am
!
"
said
Mrs
Musgrove
to
Mrs
Croft
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pretty
well
,
ma'am
in
the
fifteen
years
of
my
marriage
;
though
many
women
have
done
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
crossed
the
Atlantic
four
times
,
and
have
been
once
to
the
East
Indies
,
and
back
again
,
and
only
once
;
besides
being
in
different
places
about
home
:
Cork
,
and
Lisbon
,
and
Gibraltar
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
went
beyond
the
Streights
,
and
never
was
in
the
West
Indies
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
call
Bermuda
or
Bahama
,
you
know
,
the
West
Indies
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
had
not
a
word
to
say
in
dissent
;
she
could
not
accuse
herself
of
having
ever
called
them
anything
in
the
whole
course
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
do
assure
you
,
ma'am
,
"
pursued
Mrs
Croft
,
"
that
nothing
can
exceed
the
accommodations
of
a
man
-
of
-
war
<EOS>
;
I
speak
,
you
know
,
of
the
higher
rates
.
<EOS>
When
you
come
to
a
frigate
,
of
course
,
you
are
more
confined
;
though
any
reasonable
woman
may
be
perfectly
happy
in
one
of
them
;
and
I
can
safely
say
,
that
the
happiest
part
of
my
life
has
been
spent
on
board
a
ship
.
<EOS>
While
we
were
together
,
you
know
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
feared
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
!
<EOS>
I
have
always
been
blessed
with
excellent
health
,
and
no
climate
disagrees
with
me
.
<EOS>
A
little
disordered
always
the
first
twenty
-
four
hours
of
going
to
sea
,
but
never
knew
what
sickness
was
afterwards
.
<EOS>
The
only
time
I
ever
really
suffered
in
body
or
mind
,
the
only
time
that
I
ever
fancied
myself
unwell
,
or
had
any
ideas
of
danger
,
was
the
winter
that
I
passed
by
myself
at
Deal
,
when
the
Admiral
(
Captain
Croft
then
)
was
in
the
North
Seas
.
<EOS>
I
lived
in
perpetual
fright
at
that
time
,
and
had
all
manner
of
imaginary
complaints
from
not
knowing
what
to
do
with
myself
,
or
when
I
should
hear
from
him
next
;
but
as
long
as
we
could
be
together
,
nothing
ever
ailed
me
,
and
I
never
met
with
the
smallest
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
,
oh
yes
!
<EOS>
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
Mrs
Croft
,
"
was
Mrs
Musgrove
's
hearty
answer
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
so
bad
as
a
separation
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
it
is
,
for
Mr
Musgrove
always
attends
the
assizes
,
and
I
am
so
glad
when
they
are
over
,
and
he
is
safe
back
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
evening
ended
with
dancing
.
<EOS>
On
its
being
proposed
,
Anne
offered
her
services
,
as
usual
;
and
though
her
eyes
would
sometimes
fill
with
tears
as
she
sat
at
the
instrument
,
she
was
extremely
glad
to
be
employed
,
and
desired
nothing
in
return
but
to
be
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
merry
,
joyous
party
,
and
<EOS>
no
one
seemed
in
higher
spirits
than
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
he
had
every
thing
to
elevate
him
which
general
attention
and
deference
,
and
especially
the
attention
of
all
the
young
women
,
could
do
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Hayters
,
the
females
of
the
family
of
cousins
already
mentioned
,
were
apparently
admitted
to
the
honour
of
being
in
love
with
him
;
and
as
for
Henrietta
and
Louisa
,
they
both
seemed
so
entirely
occupied
by
him
,
that
nothing
but
the
continued
appearance
of
the
most
perfect
good
-
will
between
themselves
could
have
made
it
credible
that
they
were
not
decided
rivals
.
<EOS>
If
he
were
a
little
spoilt
by
such
universal
,
such
eager
admiration
,
who
could
wonder
?
  
<EOS>
These
were
some
of
the
thoughts
which
occupied
Anne
,
while
her
fingers
were
mechanically
at
work
,
proceeding
for
half
an
hour
together
,
equally
without
error
,
and
without
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Once
she
felt
that
he
was
looking
at
herself
,
observing
her
altered
features
,
perhaps
,
trying
to
trace
in
them
the
ruins
of
the
face
which
had
once
charmed
him
;
and
once
she
knew
that
he
must
have
spoken
of
her
;
she
was
hardly
aware
of
it
,
till
she
heard
the
answer
;
but
then
she
was
sure
of
his
having
asked
his
partner
whether
Miss
Elliot
never
danced
?
<EOS>
The
answer
was
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
;
never
;
she
has
quite
given
up
dancing
.
<EOS>
She
had
rather
play
.
<EOS>
She
is
never
tired
of
playing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Once
,
too
,
he
spoke
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
left
the
instrument
on
the
dancing
being
over
,
and
he
had
sat
down
to
try
to
make
out
an
air
which
he
wished
to
give
the
Miss
Musgroves
an
idea
of
.
<EOS>
Unintentionally
she
returned
to
that
part
of
the
room
;
he
saw
her
,
and
,
instantly
rising
,
said
,
with
studied
politeness
    
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
madam
,
this
is
your
seat
;
"
and
though
she
immediately
drew
back
with
a
decided
negative
,
he
was
not
to
be
induced
to
sit
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
did
not
wish
for
more
of
such
looks
and
speeches
.
<EOS>
His
cold
politeness
,
his
ceremonious
grace
,
were
worse
than
anything
.
    
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
was
come
to
Kellynch
as
to
a
home
,
to
stay
as
long
as
he
liked
,
being
as
thoroughly
the
object
of
the
Admiral
's
fraternal
kindness
as
of
his
wife
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
intended
,
on
first
arriving
,
to
proceed
very
soon
into
Shropshire
,
and
visit
the
brother
settled
in
that
country
,
but
the
attractions
of
Uppercross
induced
him
to
put
this
off
.
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
of
friendliness
,
and
of
flattery
,
and
of
everything
most
bewitching
in
his
reception
there
;
the
old
were
so
hospitable
,
the
young
so
agreeable
,
that
he
could
not
but
resolve
to
remain
where
he
was
,
and
take
all
the
charms
and
perfections
of
Edward
's
wife
upon
credit
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
soon
Uppercross
with
him
almost
every
day
.
<EOS>
The
Musgroves
could
hardly
be
more
ready
to
invite
than
he
to
come
,
particularly
in
the
morning
,
when
he
had
no
companion
at
home
,
for
the
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
<EOS>
were
generally
out
of
doors
together
,
interesting
themselves
in
their
new
possessions
,
their
grass
,
and
their
sheep
,
and
dawdling
about
in
a
way
not
endurable
to
a
third
person
,
or
driving
out
in
a
gig
,
lately
added
to
their
establishment
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
there
had
been
but
one
opinion
of
Captain
Wentworth
among
the
Musgroves
and
their
dependencies
.
<EOS>
It
was
unvarying
,
warm
admiration
everywhere
;
but
this
intimate
footing
was
not
more
than
established
,
when
a
certain
Charles
Hayter
returned
among
them
,
to
be
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
it
,
and
to
think
Captain
Wentworth
very
much
in
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
was
the
eldest
of
all
the
cousins
,
and
a
very
amiable
,
pleasing
young
man
,
between
whom
and
Henrietta
there
had
been
a
considerable
appearance
of
attachment
previous
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
introduction
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
orders
;
and
having
a
curacy
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
residence
was
not
required
,
lived
at
his
father
's
house
,
only
two
miles
from
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
A
short
absence
from
home
had
left
his
fair
one
unguarded
by
his
attentions
at
this
critical
period
,
and
when
he
came
back
he
had
the
pain
of
finding
very
altered
manners
,
and
of
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
and
Mrs
Hayter
were
sisters
.
<EOS>
They
had
each
had
money
,
but
their
marriages
had
made
a
material
difference
in
their
degree
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
Mr
Hayter
had
some
property
of
his
own
,
but
it
was
insignificant
compared
with
Mr
Musgrove
's
;
and
while
the
Musgroves
were
in
the
first
class
of
society
in
the
country
,
the
young
Hayters
would
,
from
their
parents
'
inferior
,
retired
,
and
unpolished
way
of
living
,
and
their
own
defective
education
,
have
been
hardly
in
any
class
at
all
,
but
for
their
connexion
with
Uppercross
,
this
eldest
son
of
course
excepted
,
who
had
chosen
to
be
a
scholar
and
a
gentleman
,
and
who
was
very
superior
in
cultivation
and
manners
to
all
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
families
had
always
been
on
excellent
terms
,
there
being
no
pride
on
one
side
,
and
no
envy
on
the
other
,
and
only
such
a
consciousness
of
superiority
in
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
as
made
them
pleased
to
improve
their
cousins
.
<EOS>
Charles
's
attentions
to
Henrietta
had
been
observed
by
her
father
and
mother
without
any
disapprobation
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
a
great
match
for
her
;
but
if
Henrietta
liked
him
,
"
  
and
Henrietta
did
seem
to
like
him
.
  
<EOS>
Henrietta
fully
thought
so
herself
,
before
Captain
Wentworth
came
;
but
from
that
time
Cousin
Charles
had
been
very
much
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
Which
of
the
two
sisters
was
preferred
by
Captain
Wentworth
<EOS>
was
as
yet
quite
doubtful
,
as
far
as
Anne
's
observation
reached
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
was
perhaps
the
prettiest
,
Louisa
had
the
higher
spirits
;
and
she
knew
not
now
,
whether
the
more
gentle
or
the
more
lively
character
were
most
likely
to
attract
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
,
either
from
seeing
little
,
or
from
an
entire
confidence
in
the
discretion
of
both
their
daughters
,
and
of
all
the
young
men
who
came
near
them
,
seemed
to
leave
everything
to
take
its
chance
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
the
smallest
appearance
of
solicitude
or
remark
about
them
in
the
Mansion
-
house
;
but
it
was
different
at
the
Cottage
<EOS>
:
the
young
couple
there
were
more
disposed
to
speculate
and
wonder
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
had
not
been
above
four
or
five
times
in
the
Miss
Musgroves
'
company
,
and
Charles
Hayter
had
but
just
reappeared
,
when
Anne
had
to
listen
to
the
opinions
of
her
brother
and
sister
,
as
to
which
was
the
one
liked
best
.
<EOS>
Charles
gave
it
for
Louisa
,
Mary
for
Henrietta
,
but
quite
agreeing
that
to
have
him
marry
either
could
be
extremely
delightful
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
"
had
never
seen
a
pleasanter
man
in
his
life
;
and
from
what
he
had
once
heard
Captain
Wentworth
himself
say
,
was
very
sure
that
he
had
not
made
less
than
twenty
thousand
pounds
by
the
war
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
fortune
at
once
;
besides
which
,
there
would
be
the
chance
of
what
might
be
done
in
any
future
war
;
and
he
was
sure
Captain
Wentworth
was
as
likely
a
man
to
distinguish
himself
as
any
officer
in
the
navy
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
would
be
a
capital
match
for
either
of
his
sisters
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Upon
my
word
it
would
,
"
replied
Mary
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dear
me
!
<EOS>
If
he
should
rise
to
any
very
great
honours
!
<EOS>
If
he
should
ever
be
made
a
baronet
!
"
<EOS>
Lady
Wentworth
'
sounds
very
well
.
<EOS>
That
would
be
a
noble
thing
,
indeed
,
for
Henrietta
!
<EOS>
She
would
take
place
of
me
then
,
and
Henrietta
would
not
dislike
that
.
<EOS>
Sir
Frederick
and
Lady
Wentworth
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
but
a
new
creation
,
however
,
and
I
never
think
much
of
your
new
creations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
suited
Mary
best
to
think
Henrietta
the
one
preferred
on
the
very
account
of
Charles
Hayter
,
whose
pretensions
she
wished
to
see
put
an
end
to
.
<EOS>
She
looked
down
very
decidedly
upon
the
Hayters
,
and
thought
it
would
be
quite
a
misfortune
to
have
the
existing
connection
between
the
families
renewed
 
very
sad
for
herself
and
her
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
can
not
think
him
at
all
a
fit
match
for
Henrietta
;
and
considering
the
alliances
which
the
Musgroves
have
made
,
she
has
no
right
to
throw
herself
away
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
any
young
woman
has
a
right
to
make
a
choice
that
may
be
disagreeable
and
inconvenient
to
the
principal
part
of
her
family
,
and
be
giving
bad
connections
to
those
who
have
not
been
used
to
them
.
<EOS>
And
,
pray
,
who
is
Charles
Hayter
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
country
curate
.
<EOS>
A
most
improper
match
for
Miss
Musgrove
of
Uppercross
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
however
,
would
not
agree
with
her
here
;
for
besides
having
a
regard
for
his
cousin
,
Charles
Hayter
was
an
eldest
son
,
and
he
saw
things
as
an
eldest
son
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
you
are
talking
nonsense
,
Mary
,
"
was
therefore
his
answer
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
a
great
match
for
Henrietta
,
but
Charles
has
a
very
fair
chance
,
through
the
Spicers
,
of
getting
something
from
the
Bishop
in
the
course
of
a
year
or
two
;
and
you
will
please
to
remember
,
that
he
is
the
eldest
son
;
whenever
my
uncle
dies
,
he
steps
into
very
pretty
property
.
<EOS>
The
estate
at
Winthrop
is
not
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
acres
,
besides
the
farm
near
Taunton
,
which
is
some
of
the
best
land
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
grant
you
,
that
any
of
them
but
Charles
would
be
a
very
shocking
match
for
Henrietta
,
and
indeed
it
could
not
be
;
he
is
the
only
one
that
could
be
possible
;
but
he
is
a
very
good
-
natured
,
good
sort
of
a
fellow
;
and
whenever
Winthrop
comes
into
his
hands
,
he
will
make
a
different
sort
of
place
of
it
,
and
live
in
a
very
different
sort
of
way
;
and
with
that
property
,
he
will
never
be
a
contemptible
man
 
good
,
freehold
property
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
<EOS>
;
Henrietta
might
do
worse
than
marry
Charles
Hayter
;
and
if
she
has
him
,
and
Louisa
can
get
Captain
Wentworth
<EOS>
,
I
shall
be
very
well
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charles
may
say
what
he
pleases
,
"
cried
Mary
to
Anne
,
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
room
,
"
but
it
would
be
shocking
to
have
Henrietta
marry
Charles
Hayter
;
a
very
bad
thing
for
her
,
and
still
worse
for
me
;
and
therefore
it
is
very
much
to
be
wished
that
Captain
Wentworth
may
soon
put
him
quite
out
of
her
head
,
and
I
have
very
little
doubt
that
he
has
.
<EOS>
She
took
hardly
any
notice
of
Charles
Hayter
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
been
there
to
see
her
behaviour
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
liking
Louisa
as
well
as
Henrietta
,
it
is
nonsense
to
say
so
;
for
he
certainly
does
like
Henrietta
a
great
deal
the
best
.
<EOS>
But
Charles
is
so
positive
!
<EOS>
I
wish
you
had
been
with
us
yesterday
,
for
then
you
might
have
decided
between
us
;
and
I
am
sure
you
would
have
thought
as
I
did
,
unless
you
had
been
determined
to
give
it
against
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
dinner
at
Mr
Musgrove
's
had
been
the
occasion
when
all
these
things
should
have
been
seen
by
Anne
;
but
she
had
staid
at
home
,
under
the
mixed
plea
of
a
headache
of
her
own
,
and
some
return
of
indisposition
in
little
Charles
.
<EOS>
She
had
thought
only
of
avoiding
Captain
Wentworth
;
but
an
escape
from
being
appealed
to
as
umpire
was
now
added
to
the
advantages
of
a
quiet
evening
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
views
,
she
deemed
it
of
more
consequence
that
he
should
know
his
own
mind
early
enough
not
to
be
endangering
the
happiness
of
either
sister
,
or
impeaching
his
own
honour
,
than
that
he
should
prefer
Henrietta
to
Louisa
,
or
Louisa
to
Henrietta
.
<EOS>
Either
of
them
would
,
in
all
probability
,
make
him
an
affectionate
,
good
-
humoured
wife
.
<EOS>
With
regard
to
Charles
Hayter
,
she
had
delicacy
which
must
be
pained
by
any
lightness
of
conduct
in
a
well
-
meaning
young
woman
,
and
a
heart
to
sympathize
in
any
of
the
sufferings
it
occasioned
;
but
if
Henrietta
found
herself
mistaken
in
the
nature
of
her
feelings
,
the
alternation
could
not
be
understood
too
soon
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
had
met
with
much
to
disquiet
and
mortify
him
in
his
cousin
's
behaviour
.
<EOS>
She
had
too
old
a
regard
for
him
to
be
so
wholly
estranged
as
might
in
two
meetings
<EOS>
extinguish
every
past
hope
,
and
leave
him
nothing
to
do
but
to
keep
away
from
Uppercross
:
but
there
was
such
a
change
as
became
very
alarming
,
when
such
a
man
as
Captain
Wentworth
was
to
be
regarded
as
the
probable
cause
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
absent
only
two
Sundays
,
and
when
they
parted
,
had
left
her
interested
,
even
to
the
height
of
his
wishes
,
in
his
prospect
of
soon
quitting
his
present
curacy
,
and
obtaining
that
of
Uppercross
instead
.
<EOS>
It
had
then
seemed
the
object
nearest
her
heart
,
that
Dr
Shirley
,
the
rector
,
who
for
more
than
forty
years
had
been
zealously
discharging
all
the
duties
of
his
office
,
but
was
now
growing
too
infirm
for
many
of
them
,
should
be
quite
fixed
on
engaging
a
curate
;
should
make
his
curacy
quite
as
good
as
he
could
afford
,
and
should
give
Charles
Hayter
the
promise
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
advantage
of
his
having
to
come
only
to
Uppercross
,
instead
of
going
six
miles
another
way
;
of
his
having
,
in
every
respect
,
a
better
curacy
;
of
his
belonging
to
their
dear
Dr
Shirley
,
and
of
dear
,
good
<EOS>
Dr
Shirley
's
being
relieved
from
the
duty
which
he
could
no
longer
get
through
without
most
injurious
fatigue
,
had
been
a
great
deal
,
even
to
Louisa
,
but
had
been
almost
everything
to
Henrietta
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
,
alas
!
<EOS>
the
zeal
of
the
business
was
gone
by
.
<EOS>
Louisa
could
not
listen
at
all
to
his
account
of
a
conversation
which
he
had
just
held
with
Dr
Shirley
:
she
was
at
a
window
,
looking
out
for
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
even
Henrietta
had
at
best
only
a
divided
attention
to
give
,
and
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
the
former
doubt
and
solicitude
of
the
negotiation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
am
very
glad
indeed
:
<EOS>
but
I
always
thought
you
would
have
it
;
I
always
thought
you
sure
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
appear
to
me
that
 
in
short
,
you
know
,
Dr
Shirley
must
have
a
curate
,
and
you
had
secured
his
promise
.
<EOS>
Is
he
coming
,
Louisa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
very
soon
after
the
dinner
at
the
Musgroves
,
at
which
Anne
had
not
been
present
,
Captain
Wentworth
walked
into
the
drawing
-
room
at
the
Cottage
,
where
were
only
herself
and
the
little
invalid
Charles
,
who
was
lying
on
the
sofa
.
  
<EOS>
The
surprise
of
finding
himself
almost
alone
with
Anne
Elliot
,
deprived
his
manners
of
their
usual
composure
:
he
started
,
and
could
only
say
,
"
I
thought
the
Miss
Musgroves
had
been
here
:
Mrs
Musgrove
told
me
I
should
find
them
here
,
"
before
he
walked
to
the
window
to
recollect
himself
,
and
feel
how
he
ought
to
behave
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
up
stairs
with
my
sister
:
they
will
be
down
in
a
few
moments
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
"
had
been
Anne
's
reply
,
in
all
the
confusion
that
was
natural
;
and
if
the
child
had
not
called
her
to
come
and
do
something
for
him
,
she
would
have
been
out
of
the
room
the
next
moment
,
and
released
Captain
Wentworth
as
well
as
herself
.
  
<EOS>
He
continued
at
the
window
;
and
after
calmly
and
politely
saying
,
"
I
hope
the
little
boy
is
better
,
"
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
kneel
down
by
the
sofa
,
and
remain
there
to
satisfy
her
patient
;
and
thus
they
continued
a
few
minutes
,
when
,
to
her
very
great
satisfaction
,
she
heard
some
other
person
crossing
the
little
vestibule
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
,
on
turning
her
head
,
to
see
the
master
of
the
house
;
but
it
proved
to
be
one
much
less
calculated
for
making
matters
easy
 
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
,
probably
not
at
all
better
pleased
by
the
sight
of
Captain
Wentworth
than
Captain
Wentworth
had
been
by
the
sight
of
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
attempted
to
say
,
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
Will
you
not
sit
down
?
<EOS>
The
others
will
be
here
presently
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
however
,
came
from
his
window
,
apparently
not
ill
-
disposed
for
conversation
;
but
Charles
Hayter
soon
put
an
end
to
his
attempts
by
seating
himself
near
the
table
,
and
taking
up
the
newspaper
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
returned
to
his
window
.
  
<EOS>
Another
minute
brought
another
addition
.
<EOS>
The
younger
boy
,
a
remarkable
stout
,
forward
child
,
of
two
years
old
,
having
got
the
door
opened
for
him
by
some
one
without
,
made
his
determined
appearance
among
them
,
and
went
straight
to
the
sofa
to
see
what
was
going
on
,
and
put
in
his
claim
to
anything
good
that
might
be
giving
away
.
  
<EOS>
There
being
nothing
to
eat
,
he
could
only
have
some
play
;
and
as
his
aunt
would
not
let
him
tease
his
sick
brother
,
he
began
to
fasten
himself
upon
her
,
as
she
knelt
,
in
such
a
way
that
,
busy
as
she
was
about
Charles
,
she
could
not
shake
him
off
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
to
him
,
ordered
,
entreated
,
and
insisted
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Once
she
did
contrive
to
push
him
away
,
but
the
boy
had
the
greater
pleasure
in
getting
upon
her
back
again
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
said
she
,
"
get
down
this
moment
.
<EOS>
You
are
extremely
troublesome
.
<EOS>
I
am
very
angry
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Walter
,
"
cried
Charles
Hayter
,
"
why
do
you
not
do
as
you
are
bid
?
<EOS>
Do
not
you
hear
your
aunt
speak
?
<EOS>
Come
to
me
,
Walter
,
come
to
cousin
Charles
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
not
a
bit
did
Walter
stir
.
  
<EOS>
In
another
moment
,
however
,
she
found
herself
in
the
state
of
being
released
from
him
;
some
one
was
taking
him
from
her
,
though
he
had
bent
down
her
head
so
much
,
that
his
little
sturdy
hands
were
unfastened
from
around
her
neck
,
and
he
was
resolutely
borne
away
,
before
she
knew
that
Captain
Wentworth
had
done
it
.
  
<EOS>
Her
sensations
on
the
discovery
made
her
perfectly
speechless
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
even
thank
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
hang
over
little
Charles
,
with
most
disordered
feelings
.
<EOS>
His
kindness
in
stepping
forward
to
her
relief
,
the
manner
,
the
silence
in
which
it
had
passed
,
the
little
particulars
of
the
circumstance
,
with
the
conviction
soon
forced
on
her
by
the
noise
he
was
studiously
making
with
the
child
,
that
he
meant
to
avoid
hearing
her
thanks
,
and
rather
sought
to
testify
that
her
conversation
was
the
last
of
his
wants
,
produced
such
a
confusion
of
varying
,
but
very
painful
agitation
,
as
she
could
not
recover
from
,
till
enabled
by
the
entrance
of
Mary
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
to
make
over
her
little
patient
to
their
cares
,
and
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
stay
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
an
opportunity
of
watching
the
loves
and
jealousies
of
the
four
 
<EOS>
they
were
now
altogether
;
but
she
could
stay
for
none
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
Charles
Hayter
was
not
well
inclined
towards
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
strong
impression
of
his
having
said
,
in
a
vext
tone
of
voice
,
after
Captain
Wentworth
's
interference
,
"
You
ought
to
have
minded
me
,
Walter
;
I
told
you
not
to
teaze
your
aunt
;
"
and
could
comprehend
his
regretting
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
do
what
he
ought
to
have
done
himself
.
<EOS>
But
neither
Charles
Hayter
's
feelings
,
nor
anybody
's
feelings
,
could
interest
her
,
till
she
had
a
little
better
arranged
her
own
.
<EOS>
She
was
ashamed
of
herself
,
quite
ashamed
of
being
so
nervous
,
so
overcome
by
such
a
trifle
;
but
so
it
was
,
and
it
required
a
long
application
of
solitude
and
reflection
to
recover
her
.
    
<EOS>
Other
opportunities
of
making
her
observations
could
not
fail
to
occur
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
soon
been
in
company
with
all
the
four
together
often
enough
to
have
an
opinion
,
though
too
wise
to
acknowledge
as
much
at
home
,
where
she
knew
it
would
have
satisfied
neither
husband
nor
wife
;
for
while
she
considered
Louisa
to
be
rather
the
favourite
,
she
could
not
but
think
,
as
far
as
she
might
dare
to
judge
from
memory
and
experience
,
that
Captain
Wentworth
was
not
in
love
with
either
.
<EOS>
They
were
more
in
love
with
him
;
yet
there
it
was
not
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
little
fever
of
admiration
;
but
it
might
,
probably
must
,
end
in
love
with
some
.
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
seemed
aware
of
being
slighted
,
and
yet
Henrietta
had
sometimes
the
air
of
being
divided
between
them
.
<EOS>
Anne
longed
for
the
power
of
representing
to
them
all
what
they
were
about
,
and
of
pointing
out
some
of
the
evils
they
were
exposing
themselves
to
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
attribute
guile
to
any
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
highest
satisfaction
to
her
to
believe
Captain
Wentworth
not
in
the
least
aware
of
the
pain
he
was
occasioning
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
triumph
,
no
pitiful
triumph
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
probably
,
never
heard
,
and
never
thought
of
any
claims
of
Charles
Hayter
.
<EOS>
He
was
only
wrong
in
accepting
the
attentions
(
for
accepting
must
be
the
word
)
of
two
young
women
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
struggle
,
however
,
Charles
Hayter
seemed
to
quit
the
field
.
<EOS>
Three
days
had
passed
without
his
coming
once
to
Uppercross
;
a
most
decided
change
.
<EOS>
He
had
even
refused
one
regular
invitation
to
dinner
;
and
having
been
found
on
the
occasion
by
Mr
Musgrove
with
some
large
books
before
him
,
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
were
sure
all
could
not
be
right
,
and
talked
,
with
grave
faces
,
of
his
studying
himself
to
death
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mary
's
hope
and
belief
that
he
had
received
a
positive
dismissal
from
Henrietta
,
and
her
husband
lived
under
the
constant
dependence
of
seeing
him
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
only
feel
that
Charles
Hayter
was
wise
.
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
about
this
time
Charles
Musgrove
and
Captain
Wentworth
being
gone
a
-
shooting
together
,
as
the
sisters
in
the
Cottage
were
sitting
quietly
at
work
,
they
were
visited
at
the
window
by
the
sisters
from
the
Mansion
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
fine
November
day
,
and
the
Miss
Musgroves
came
through
the
little
grounds
,
and
stopped
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
say
,
that
they
were
going
to
take
a
long
walk
,
and
therefore
concluded
Mary
could
not
like
to
go
with
them
;
and
when
Mary
immediately
replied
,
with
some
jealousy
at
not
being
supposed
a
good
walker
,
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
,
I
should
like
to
join
you
very
much
,
I
am
very
fond
of
a
long
walk
;
<EOS>
"
Anne
felt
persuaded
,
by
the
looks
of
the
two
girls
,
that
it
was
precisely
what
they
did
not
wish
,
and
admired
again
the
sort
of
necessity
which
the
family
habits
seemed
to
produce
,
of
everything
being
to
be
communicated
,
and
everything
being
to
be
done
together
,
however
undesired
and
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
dissuade
Mary
from
going
,
but
in
vain
;
and
that
being
the
case
,
thought
it
best
to
accept
the
Miss
Musgroves
'
much
more
cordial
invitation
to
herself
to
go
likewise
,
as
she
might
be
useful
in
turning
back
with
her
sister
,
and
lessening
the
interference
in
any
plan
of
their
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
imagine
why
they
should
suppose
I
should
not
like
a
long
walk
,
"
said
Mary
,
as
she
went
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
Everybody
is
always
supposing
that
I
am
not
a
good
walker
;
and
yet
they
would
not
have
been
pleased
,
if
we
had
refused
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
When
people
come
in
this
manner
on
purpose
to
ask
us
,
how
can
one
say
no
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
as
they
were
setting
off
,
the
gentlemen
returned
.
<EOS>
They
had
taken
out
a
young
dog
,
who
had
spoilt
their
sport
,
and
sent
them
back
early
.
<EOS>
Their
time
and
strength
,
and
spirits
,
were
,
therefore
,
exactly
ready
for
this
walk
,
and
they
entered
into
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Could
Anne
have
foreseen
such
a
junction
,
she
would
have
staid
at
home
;
but
,
from
some
feelings
of
interest
and
curiosity
,
she
fancied
now
that
it
was
too
late
to
retract
,
and
the
whole
six
set
forward
together
in
the
direction
chosen
by
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
who
evidently
considered
the
walk
as
under
their
guidance
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
object
was
,
not
to
be
in
the
way
of
anybody
;
and
where
the
narrow
paths
across
the
fields
made
many
separations
necessary
,
to
keep
with
her
brother
and
sister
.
<EOS>
Her
pleasure
in
the
walk
must
arise
from
the
exercise
and
the
day
,
from
the
view
of
the
last
smiles
of
the
year
upon
the
tawny
leaves
,
and
withered
hedges
,
and
from
repeating
to
herself
some
few
of
the
thousand
poetical
descriptions
extant
of
autumn
,
that
season
of
peculiar
and
inexhaustible
influence
on
the
mind
of
taste
and
tenderness
,
that
season
which
had
drawn
from
every
poet
,
worthy
of
being
read
,
some
attempt
at
description
,
or
some
lines
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
occupied
her
mind
as
much
as
possible
in
such
like
musings
and
quotations
;
but
it
was
not
possible
,
that
when
within
reach
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
conversation
with
either
of
the
Miss
Musgroves
,
she
should
not
try
to
hear
it
;
yet
she
caught
little
very
remarkable
.
<EOS>
It
was
mere
lively
chat
,
such
as
any
young
persons
,
on
an
intimate
footing
,
might
fall
into
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
engaged
with
Louisa
than
with
Henrietta
.
<EOS>
Louisa
certainly
put
more
forward
for
his
notice
than
her
sister
.
<EOS>
This
distinction
appeared
to
increase
,
and
there
was
one
speech
of
Louisa
's
which
struck
her
.
<EOS>
After
one
of
the
many
praises
of
the
day
,
which
were
continually
bursting
forth
,
Captain
Wentworth
added
:
    
"
What
glorious
weather
for
the
Admiral
and
my
sister
!
<EOS>
They
meant
to
take
a
long
drive
this
morning
;
perhaps
we
may
hail
them
from
some
of
these
hills
.
<EOS>
They
talked
of
coming
into
this
side
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whereabouts
they
will
upset
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
does
happen
very
often
,
I
assure
you
;
but
my
sister
makes
nothing
of
it
;
she
would
as
lieve
be
tossed
out
as
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
You
make
the
most
of
it
,
I
know
,
"
cried
Louisa
,
"
but
if
it
were
really
so
,
I
should
do
just
the
same
in
her
place
.
<EOS>
If
I
loved
a
man
,
as
she
loves
the
Admiral
,
I
would
always
be
with
him
,
nothing
should
ever
separate
us
,
and
I
would
rather
be
overturned
by
him
,
than
driven
safely
by
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
spoken
with
enthusiasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
catching
the
same
tone
;
"
I
honour
you
!
"
<EOS>
And
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
little
while
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
immediately
fall
into
a
quotation
again
.
<EOS>
The
sweet
scenes
of
autumn
were
for
a
while
put
by
,
unless
some
tender
sonnet
,
fraught
with
the
apt
analogy
of
the
declining
year
,
with
declining
happiness
,
and
the
images
of
youth
and
hope
,
and
spring
,
all
gone
together
,
blessed
her
memory
.
<EOS>
She
roused
herself
to
say
,
as
they
struck
by
order
into
another
path
,
"
Is
not
this
one
of
the
ways
to
Winthrop
?
"
<EOS>
But
nobody
heard
,
or
,
at
least
,
nobody
answered
her
.
  
<EOS>
Winthrop
,
however
,
or
its
environs
 
for
young
men
are
,
sometimes
to
be
met
with
,
strolling
about
near
home
 
<EOS>
was
their
destination
;
and
after
another
half
mile
of
gradual
ascent
through
large
enclosures
,
where
the
ploughs
at
work
,
and
the
fresh
made
path
spoke
the
farmer
counteracting
the
sweets
of
poetical
despondence
,
and
meaning
to
have
spring
again
,
they
gained
the
summit
of
the
most
considerable
hill
,
which
parted
Uppercross
and
Winthrop
,
and
soon
commanded
a
full
view
of
the
latter
,
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
other
side
.
  
<EOS>
Winthrop
,
without
beauty
and
without
dignity
,
was
stretched
before
them
an
indifferent
house
,
standing
low
,
and
hemmed
in
by
the
barns
and
buildings
of
a
farm
-
yard
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
exclaimed
,
"
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
here
is
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
I
declare
I
had
no
idea
!
<EOS>
Well
now
,
I
think
we
had
better
turn
back
;
I
am
excessively
tired
.
"
  
<EOS>
Henrietta
,
conscious
and
ashamed
,
and
seeing
no
cousin
Charles
walking
along
any
path
,
or
leaning
against
any
gate
,
was
ready
to
do
as
Mary
wished
;
but
"
No
!
"
said
Charles
Musgrove
,
and
"
No
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Louisa
more
eagerly
,
and
taking
her
sister
aside
,
seemed
to
be
arguing
the
matter
warmly
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
was
very
decidedly
declaring
his
resolution
of
calling
on
his
aunt
,
now
that
he
was
so
near
;
and
very
evidently
,
though
more
fearfully
,
trying
to
induce
his
wife
to
go
too
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
one
of
the
points
on
which
the
lady
shewed
her
strength
;
and
when
he
recommended
the
advantage
of
resting
herself
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
Winthrop
,
as
she
felt
so
tired
,
she
resolutely
answered
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
walking
up
that
hill
again
would
do
her
more
harm
than
any
sitting
down
could
do
her
good
;
"
and
,
in
short
,
her
look
and
manner
declared
,
that
go
she
would
not
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
little
succession
of
these
sort
of
debates
and
consultations
,
it
was
settled
between
Charles
and
his
two
sisters
,
that
he
and
Henrietta
should
just
run
down
for
a
few
minutes
,
to
see
their
aunt
and
cousins
,
while
the
rest
of
the
party
waited
for
them
at
the
top
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Louisa
seemed
the
principal
arranger
of
the
plan
;
and
,
as
she
went
a
little
way
with
them
,
down
the
hill
,
still
talking
to
Henrietta
,
Mary
took
the
opportunity
of
looking
scornfully
around
her
,
and
saying
to
Captain
Wentworth
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
unpleasant
,
having
such
connexions
!
<EOS>
But
,
I
assure
you
,
I
have
never
been
in
the
house
above
twice
in
my
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
received
no
other
answer
,
than
an
artificial
,
assenting
smile
,
followed
by
a
contemptuous
glance
,
as
he
turned
away
,
which
Anne
perfectly
knew
the
meaning
of
.
  
<EOS>
The
brow
of
the
hill
,
where
they
remained
,
was
a
cheerful
spot
:
Louisa
returned
;
and
Mary
,
finding
a
comfortable
seat
for
herself
on
the
step
of
a
stile
,
was
very
well
satisfied
so
long
as
the
others
all
stood
about
her
;
but
when
Louisa
drew
Captain
Wentworth
away
,
to
try
for
a
gleaning
of
nuts
in
an
adjoining
hedge
-
row
,
and
they
were
gone
by
degrees
quite
out
of
sight
and
sound
,
Mary
was
happy
no
longer
;
she
quarrelled
with
her
own
seat
,
was
sure
Louisa
had
got
a
much
better
somewhere
,
and
nothing
could
prevent
her
from
going
to
look
for
a
better
also
.
<EOS>
She
turned
through
the
same
gate
,
but
could
not
see
them
.
<EOS>
Anne
found
a
nice
seat
for
her
,
on
a
dry
sunny
bank
,
under
the
hedge
-
row
,
in
which
she
had
no
doubt
of
their
still
being
,
in
some
spot
or
other
.
<EOS>
Mary
sat
down
for
a
moment
,
but
it
would
not
do
;
she
was
sure
Louisa
had
found
a
better
seat
somewhere
else
,
and
she
would
go
on
till
she
overtook
her
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
really
tired
herself
,
was
glad
to
sit
down
;
and
she
very
soon
heard
Captain
Wentworth
and
Louisa
in
the
hedge
-
row
,
behind
her
,
as
if
making
their
way
back
along
the
rough
,
wild
sort
of
channel
,
down
the
centre
.
<EOS>
They
were
speaking
as
they
drew
near
.
<EOS>
Louisa
's
voice
was
the
first
distinguished
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
in
the
middle
of
some
eager
speech
.
<EOS>
What
Anne
first
heard
was
    
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
I
made
her
go
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bear
that
she
should
be
frightened
from
the
visit
by
such
nonsense
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
would
I
be
turned
back
from
doing
a
thing
that
I
had
determined
to
do
,
and
that
I
knew
to
be
right
,
by
the
airs
and
interference
of
such
a
person
,
or
of
any
person
I
may
say
?
<EOS>
No
,
I
have
no
idea
of
being
so
easily
persuaded
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
made
up
my
mind
,
I
have
made
it
;
and
Henrietta
seemed
entirely
to
have
made
up
hers
to
call
at
Winthrop
to
-
day
;
and
yet
,
she
was
as
near
giving
it
up
,
out
of
nonsensical
complaisance
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
turned
back
then
,
but
for
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
would
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
am
almost
ashamed
to
say
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Happy
for
her
,
to
have
such
a
mind
as
yours
at
hand
!
<EOS>
After
the
hints
you
gave
just
now
,
which
did
but
confirm
my
own
observations
,
the
last
time
I
was
in
company
with
him
,
I
need
not
affect
to
have
no
comprehension
of
what
is
going
on
.
<EOS>
I
see
that
more
than
a
mere
dutiful
morning
visit
to
your
aunt
was
in
question
;
and
woe
betide
him
,
and
her
too
,
when
it
comes
to
things
of
consequence
,
when
they
are
placed
in
circumstances
requiring
fortitude
and
strength
of
mind
,
if
she
have
not
resolution
enough
to
resist
idle
interference
in
such
a
trifle
as
this
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
is
an
amiable
creature
;
but
yours
is
the
character
of
decision
and
firmness
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
If
you
value
her
conduct
or
happiness
,
infuse
as
much
of
your
own
spirit
into
her
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
no
doubt
,
you
have
been
always
doing
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
worst
evil
of
too
yielding
and
indecisive
a
character
,
that
no
influence
over
it
can
be
depended
on
.
<EOS>
You
are
never
sure
of
a
good
impression
being
durable
;
everybody
may
sway
it
.
<EOS>
Let
those
who
would
be
happy
be
firm
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
nut
,
"
said
he
,
catching
one
down
from
an
upper
bough
,
"
to
exemplify
:
a
beautiful
glossy
nut
,
which
,
blessed
with
original
strength
,
has
outlived
all
the
storms
of
autumn
.
<EOS>
Not
a
puncture
,
not
a
weak
spot
anywhere
.
<EOS>
This
nut
,
"
he
continued
,
with
playful
solemnity
,
"
while
so
many
of
his
brethren
have
fallen
and
been
trodden
under
foot
,
is
still
in
possession
of
all
the
happiness
that
a
hazel
nut
can
be
supposed
capable
of
.
"
<EOS>
Then
returning
to
his
former
earnest
tone
 
<EOS>
"
My
first
wish
for
all
whom
I
am
interested
in
,
is
that
they
should
be
firm
.
<EOS>
If
Louisa
Musgrove
would
be
beautiful
and
happy
in
her
November
of
life
,
she
will
cherish
all
her
present
powers
of
mind
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
done
,
and
was
unanswered
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
surprised
Anne
if
Louisa
could
have
readily
answered
such
a
speech
:
words
of
such
interest
,
spoken
with
such
serious
warmth
!
<EOS>
She
could
imagine
what
Louisa
was
feeling
.
<EOS>
For
herself
,
she
feared
to
move
,
lest
she
should
be
seen
.
<EOS>
While
she
remained
,
a
bush
of
low
rambling
holly
protected
her
,
and
they
were
moving
on
.
<EOS>
Before
they
were
beyond
her
hearing
,
however
,
Louisa
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mary
is
good
-
natured
enough
in
many
respects
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
she
does
sometimes
provoke
me
excessively
,
by
her
nonsense
and
pride
 
<EOS>
the
Elliot
pride
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
great
deal
too
much
of
the
Elliot
pride
.
<EOS>
We
do
so
wish
that
Charles
had
married
Anne
instead
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
he
wanted
to
marry
Anne
?
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
Captain
Wentworth
said
    
"
Do
you
mean
that
she
refused
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
;
certainly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
that
happen
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
exactly
know
,
for
Henrietta
and
I
were
at
school
at
the
time
;
but
I
believe
about
a
year
before
he
married
Mary
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
had
accepted
him
.
<EOS>
We
should
all
have
liked
her
a
great
deal
better
;
and
papa
and
mamma
always
think
it
was
her
great
friend
Lady
Russell
's
doing
,
that
she
did
not
.
<EOS>
They
think
Charles
might
not
be
learned
and
bookish
enough
to
please
Lady
Russell
,
and
that
therefore
,
she
persuaded
Anne
to
refuse
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sounds
were
retreating
,
and
Anne
distinguished
no
more
.
<EOS>
Her
own
emotions
still
kept
her
fixed
.
<EOS>
She
had
much
to
recover
from
,
before
she
could
move
.
<EOS>
The
listener
's
proverbial
fate
was
not
absolutely
hers
;
she
had
heard
no
evil
of
herself
,
but
she
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
very
painful
import
.
<EOS>
She
saw
how
her
own
character
was
considered
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
and
there
had
been
just
that
degree
of
feeling
and
curiosity
about
her
in
his
manner
which
must
give
her
extreme
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
could
,
she
went
after
Mary
,
and
having
found
,
and
walked
back
with
her
to
their
former
station
,
by
the
stile
,
felt
some
comfort
in
their
whole
party
being
immediately
afterwards
collected
,
and
once
more
in
motion
together
.
<EOS>
Her
spirits
wanted
the
solitude
and
silence
which
only
numbers
could
give
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
and
Henrietta
returned
,
bringing
,
as
may
be
conjectured
,
Charles
Hayter
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
minutiae
of
the
business
Anne
could
not
attempt
to
understand
;
even
Captain
Wentworth
did
not
seem
admitted
to
perfect
confidence
here
;
but
that
there
had
been
a
withdrawing
on
the
gentleman
's
side
,
and
a
relenting
on
the
lady
's
,
and
that
they
were
now
very
glad
to
be
together
again
,
did
not
admit
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
looked
a
little
ashamed
,
but
very
well
pleased
;
 
Charles
Hayter
exceedingly
happy
:
and
they
were
devoted
to
each
other
almost
from
the
first
instant
of
their
all
setting
forward
for
Uppercross
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
now
marked
out
Louisa
for
Captain
Wentworth
;
nothing
could
be
plainer
;
and
where
many
divisions
were
necessary
,
or
even
where
they
were
not
,
they
walked
side
by
side
nearly
as
much
as
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
In
a
long
strip
of
meadow
land
,
where
there
was
ample
space
for
all
,
they
were
thus
divided
,
forming
three
distinct
parties
;
and
to
that
party
of
the
three
which
boasted
least
animation
,
and
least
complaisance
,
Anne
necessarily
belonged
.
<EOS>
She
joined
Charles
and
Mary
,
and
was
tired
enough
to
be
very
glad
of
Charles
's
other
arm
;
but
Charles
,
though
in
very
good
humour
with
her
,
was
out
of
temper
with
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Mary
had
shewn
herself
disobliging
to
him
,
and
was
now
to
reap
the
consequence
,
which
consequence
was
his
dropping
her
arm
almost
every
moment
to
cut
off
the
heads
of
some
nettles
in
the
hedge
with
his
switch
;
and
when
Mary
began
to
complain
of
it
,
and
lament
her
being
ill
-
used
,
according
to
custom
,
in
being
on
the
hedge
side
,
while
Anne
was
never
incommoded
on
the
other
,
he
dropped
the
arms
of
both
to
hunt
after
a
weasel
which
he
had
a
momentary
glance
of
,
and
they
could
hardly
get
him
along
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
This
long
meadow
bordered
a
lane
,
which
their
footpath
,
at
the
end
of
it
was
to
cross
,
and
when
the
party
had
all
reached
the
gate
of
exit
,
the
carriage
advancing
in
the
same
direction
,
which
had
been
some
time
heard
,
was
just
coming
up
,
and
proved
to
be
Admiral
Croft
's
gig
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
wife
had
taken
their
intended
drive
,
and
were
returning
home
.
<EOS>
Upon
hearing
how
long
a
walk
the
young
people
had
engaged
in
,
they
kindly
offered
a
seat
to
any
lady
who
might
be
particularly
tired
;
it
would
save
her
a
full
mile
,
and
they
were
going
through
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
The
invitation
was
general
,
and
generally
declined
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Musgroves
were
not
at
all
tired
,
and
Mary
was
either
offended
,
by
not
being
asked
before
any
of
the
others
,
or
what
Louisa
called
the
Elliot
pride
could
not
endure
to
make
a
third
in
a
one
horse
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
The
walking
party
had
crossed
the
lane
,
and
were
surmounting
an
opposite
stile
,
and
the
Admiral
was
putting
his
horse
in
motion
again
,
when
Captain
Wentworth
cleared
the
hedge
in
a
moment
to
say
something
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
The
something
might
be
guessed
by
its
effects
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elliot
,
I
am
sure
you
are
tired
,
"
cried
Mrs
Croft
.
<EOS>
"
Do
let
us
have
the
pleasure
of
taking
you
home
.
<EOS>
Here
is
excellent
room
for
three
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
If
we
were
all
like
you
,
I
believe
we
might
sit
four
.
<EOS>
You
must
,
indeed
,
you
must
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
still
in
the
lane
;
and
though
instinctively
beginning
to
decline
,
she
was
not
allowed
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
The
Admiral
's
kind
urgency
came
in
support
of
his
wife
's
;
they
would
not
be
refused
;
they
compressed
themselves
into
the
smallest
possible
space
to
leave
her
a
corner
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
without
saying
a
word
,
turned
to
her
,
and
quietly
obliged
her
to
be
assisted
into
the
carriage
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
he
had
done
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
the
carriage
,
and
felt
that
he
had
placed
her
there
,
that
his
will
and
his
hands
had
done
it
,
that
she
owed
it
to
his
perception
of
her
fatigue
,
and
his
resolution
to
give
her
rest
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
much
affected
by
the
view
of
his
disposition
towards
her
,
which
all
these
things
made
apparent
.
<EOS>
This
little
circumstance
seemed
the
completion
of
all
that
had
gone
before
.
<EOS>
She
understood
him
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
forgive
her
,
but
he
could
not
be
unfeeling
.
<EOS>
Though
condemning
her
for
the
past
,
and
considering
it
with
high
and
unjust
resentment
,
though
perfectly
careless
of
her
,
and
though
becoming
attached
to
another
,
still
he
could
not
see
her
suffer
,
without
the
desire
of
giving
her
relief
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
remainder
of
former
sentiment
;
it
was
an
impulse
of
pure
,
though
unacknowledged
friendship
;
it
was
a
proof
of
his
own
warm
and
amiable
heart
,
which
she
could
not
contemplate
without
emotions
so
compounded
of
pleasure
and
pain
,
that
she
knew
not
which
prevailed
.
  
<EOS>
Her
answers
to
the
kindness
and
the
remarks
of
her
companions
were
at
first
unconsciously
given
.
<EOS>
They
had
travelled
half
their
way
along
the
rough
lane
,
before
she
was
quite
awake
to
what
they
said
.
<EOS>
She
then
found
them
talking
of
"
Frederick
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
means
to
have
one
or
other
of
those
two
girls
,
Sophy
,
"
said
the
Admiral
;
"
but
there
is
no
saying
which
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
running
after
them
,
too
,
long
enough
,
one
would
think
,
to
make
up
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
this
comes
of
the
peace
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
war
now
,
he
would
have
settled
it
long
ago
.
<EOS>
We
sailors
,
Miss
Elliot
,
can
not
afford
to
make
long
courtships
in
time
of
war
.
<EOS>
How
many
days
was
it
,
my
dear
,
between
the
first
time
of
my
seeing
you
and
our
sitting
down
together
in
our
lodgings
at
North
Yarmouth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
not
talk
about
it
,
my
dear
,
"
replied
Mrs
Croft
,
pleasantly
;
"
for
if
Miss
Elliot
were
to
hear
how
soon
we
came
to
an
understanding
<EOS>
,
she
would
never
be
persuaded
that
we
could
be
happy
together
.
<EOS>
I
had
known
you
by
character
,
however
,
long
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
and
I
had
heard
of
you
as
a
very
pretty
girl
,
and
what
were
we
to
wait
for
besides
?
<EOS>
I
do
not
like
having
such
things
so
long
in
hand
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Frederick
would
spread
a
little
more
canvass
,
and
bring
us
home
one
of
these
young
ladies
to
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
Then
there
would
always
be
company
for
them
.
<EOS>
And
very
nice
young
ladies
they
both
are
;
I
hardly
know
one
from
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
good
humoured
,
unaffected
girls
,
indeed
,
"
said
Mrs
Croft
,
in
a
tone
of
calmer
praise
,
such
as
made
Anne
suspect
that
her
keener
powers
might
not
consider
either
of
them
as
quite
worthy
of
her
brother
;
"
and
a
very
respectable
family
.
<EOS>
One
could
not
be
connected
with
better
people
.
<EOS>
My
dear
Admiral
,
that
post
!
<EOS>
we
shall
certainly
take
that
post
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
by
coolly
giving
the
reins
a
better
direction
herself
they
happily
passed
the
danger
;
and
by
once
afterwards
judiciously
putting
out
her
hand
they
neither
fell
into
a
rut
,
nor
ran
foul
of
a
dung
-
cart
;
and
Anne
,
with
some
amusement
at
their
style
of
driving
,
which
she
imagined
no
bad
representation
of
the
general
guidance
of
their
affairs
,
found
herself
safely
deposited
by
them
at
the
Cottage
.
    
<EOS>
The
time
now
approached
for
Lady
Russell
's
return
:
the
day
was
even
fixed
;
and
Anne
,
being
engaged
to
join
her
as
soon
as
she
was
resettled
,
was
looking
forward
to
an
early
removal
to
Kellynch
,
and
beginning
to
think
how
her
own
comfort
was
likely
to
be
affected
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
place
her
in
the
same
village
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
within
half
a
mile
of
him
;
they
would
have
to
frequent
the
same
church
,
and
there
must
be
intercourse
between
the
two
families
.
<EOS>
This
was
against
her
;
but
on
the
other
hand
,
he
spent
so
much
of
his
time
at
Uppercross
,
that
in
removing
thence
she
might
be
considered
rather
as
leaving
him
behind
,
than
as
going
towards
him
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
she
believed
she
must
,
on
this
interesting
question
,
be
the
gainer
,
almost
as
certainly
as
in
her
change
of
domestic
society
,
in
leaving
poor
Mary
for
Lady
Russell
.
  
<EOS>
She
wished
it
might
be
possible
for
her
to
avoid
ever
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
at
the
Hall
:
those
rooms
had
witnessed
former
meetings
which
would
be
brought
too
painfully
before
her
;
but
she
was
yet
more
anxious
for
the
possibility
of
Lady
Russell
and
Captain
Wentworth
never
meeting
anywhere
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
like
each
other
,
and
no
renewal
of
acquaintance
now
could
do
any
good
;
and
were
Lady
Russell
to
see
them
together
,
she
might
think
that
he
had
too
much
self
-
possession
,
and
she
too
little
.
  
<EOS>
These
points
formed
her
chief
solicitude
in
anticipating
her
removal
from
Uppercross
,
where
she
felt
she
had
been
stationed
quite
long
enough
.
<EOS>
Her
usefulness
to
little
Charles
would
always
give
some
sweetness
to
the
memory
of
her
two
months
'
visit
there
,
but
he
was
gaining
strength
apace
,
and
she
had
nothing
else
to
stay
for
.
  
<EOS>
The
conclusion
of
her
visit
,
however
,
was
diversified
in
a
way
which
she
had
not
at
all
imagined
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
after
being
unseen
and
unheard
of
at
Uppercross
for
two
whole
days
,
appeared
again
among
them
to
justify
himself
by
a
relation
of
what
had
kept
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
A
letter
from
his
friend
,
Captain
Harville
,
having
found
him
out
at
last
,
had
brought
intelligence
of
Captain
Harville
's
being
settled
with
his
family
at
Lyme
for
the
winter
;
of
their
being
therefore
,
quite
unknowingly
,
within
twenty
miles
of
each
other
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
had
never
been
in
good
health
since
a
severe
wound
which
he
received
two
years
before
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
's
anxiety
to
see
him
had
determined
him
to
go
immediately
to
Lyme
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
there
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
<EOS>
His
acquittal
was
complete
,
his
friendship
warmly
honoured
,
a
lively
interest
excited
for
his
friend
,
and
his
description
of
the
fine
country
about
Lyme
so
feelingly
attended
to
by
the
party
,
that
an
earnest
desire
to
see
Lyme
themselves
,
and
a
project
for
going
thither
was
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
people
were
all
wild
to
see
Lyme
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
talked
of
going
there
again
himself
,
it
was
only
seventeen
miles
from
Uppercross
;
though
November
,
the
weather
was
by
no
means
bad
;
and
,
in
short
,
Louisa
,
who
was
the
most
eager
of
the
eager
,
having
formed
the
resolution
to
go
,
and
besides
the
pleasure
of
doing
as
she
liked
,
being
now
armed
with
the
idea
of
merit
in
maintaining
her
own
way
,
bore
down
all
the
wishes
of
her
father
and
mother
for
putting
it
off
till
summer
;
and
to
Lyme
they
were
to
go
 
Charles
,
Mary
,
Anne
,
Henrietta
,
Louisa
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
heedless
scheme
had
been
to
go
in
the
morning
and
return
at
night
;
but
to
this
Mr
Musgrove
,
for
the
sake
of
his
horses
,
would
not
consent
;
and
when
it
came
to
be
rationally
considered
,
a
day
in
the
middle
of
November
would
not
leave
much
time
for
seeing
a
new
place
,
after
deducting
seven
hours
,
as
the
nature
of
the
country
required
,
for
going
and
returning
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
consequently
,
to
stay
the
night
there
,
and
not
to
be
expected
back
till
the
next
day
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
This
was
felt
to
be
a
considerable
amendment
;
and
though
they
all
met
at
the
Great
House
at
rather
an
early
breakfast
hour
,
and
set
off
very
punctually
,
<EOS>
it
was
so
much
past
noon
before
the
two
carriages
,
Mr
Musgrove
's
coach
containing
the
four
ladies
,
and
Charles
's
curricle
,
in
which
he
drove
Captain
Wentworth
,
were
descending
the
long
hill
into
Lyme
,
and
entering
upon
the
still
steeper
street
of
the
town
itself
,
that
it
was
very
evident
they
would
not
have
more
than
time
for
looking
about
them
,
before
the
light
and
warmth
of
the
day
were
gone
.
  
<EOS>
After
securing
accommodations
,
and
ordering
a
dinner
at
one
of
the
inns
,
the
next
thing
to
be
done
was
unquestionably
to
walk
directly
down
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
They
were
come
too
late
in
the
year
for
any
amusement
or
variety
which
Lyme
,
as
a
public
place
,
might
offer
.
<EOS>
The
rooms
were
shut
up
,
the
lodgers
almost
all
gone
,
scarcely
any
family
<EOS>
but
of
the
residents
left
;
and
,
as
there
is
nothing
to
admire
in
the
buildings
themselves
,
the
remarkable
situation
of
the
town
,
the
principal
street
almost
hurrying
into
the
water
,
the
walk
to
the
Cobb
,
skirting
round
the
pleasant
little
bay
,
which
,
in
the
season
,
is
animated
with
bathing
machines
and
company
;
the
Cobb
itself
,
its
old
wonders
and
new
improvements
,
with
the
very
beautiful
line
of
cliffs
stretching
out
to
the
east
of
the
town
,
are
what
the
stranger
's
eye
will
seek
;
and
a
very
strange
stranger
it
must
be
,
who
does
not
see
charms
in
the
immediate
environs
of
Lyme
,
to
make
him
wish
to
know
it
better
.
<EOS>
The
scenes
in
its
neighbourhood
,
Charmouth
,
with
its
high
grounds
and
extensive
sweeps
of
country
,
and
still
more
,
its
sweet
,
retired
bay
,
backed
by
dark
cliffs
,
where
fragments
of
low
rock
among
the
sands
,
make
it
the
happiest
spot
for
watching
the
flow
of
the
tide
,
for
sitting
in
unwearied
contemplation
;
the
woody
varieties
of
the
cheerful
village
of
Up
Lyme
;
and
,
above
all
,
Pinny
,
with
its
green
chasms
between
romantic
rocks
,
where
the
scattered
forest
trees
and
orchards
of
luxuriant
growth
,
declare
that
many
a
generation
must
have
passed
away
since
the
first
partial
falling
of
the
cliff
prepared
the
ground
for
such
a
state
,
where
a
scene
so
wonderful
and
so
lovely
is
exhibited
,
as
may
more
than
equal
any
of
the
resembling
scenes
of
the
far
-
famed
Isle
of
Wight
:
these
places
must
be
visited
,
and
visited
again
,
to
make
the
worth
of
Lyme
understood
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
from
Uppercross
passing
down
by
the
now
deserted
and
melancholy
looking
rooms
,
and
still
descending
,
soon
found
themselves
on
the
sea
-
shore
;
and
lingering
only
,
as
all
must
linger
and
gaze
on
a
first
return
to
the
sea
,
who
ever
deserved
to
look
on
it
at
all
,
proceeded
towards
the
Cobb
,
equally
their
object
in
itself
and
on
Captain
Wentworth
's
account
:
for
in
a
small
house
,
near
the
foot
of
an
old
pier
of
unknown
date
,
were
the
Harvilles
settled
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
turned
in
to
call
on
his
friend
;
the
others
walked
on
,
and
he
was
to
join
them
on
the
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
by
no
means
tired
of
wondering
and
admiring
;
and
not
even
Louisa
seemed
to
feel
that
they
had
parted
with
Captain
Wentworth
long
,
when
they
saw
him
coming
after
them
,
with
three
companions
,
all
well
known
already
,
by
description
,
to
be
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
,
and
a
Captain
Benwick
,
who
was
staying
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
had
some
time
ago
been
first
lieutenant
of
the
Laconia
;
and
the
account
which
Captain
Wentworth
had
given
of
him
,
on
his
return
from
Lyme
before
,
his
warm
praise
of
him
as
an
excellent
young
man
and
an
officer
,
whom
he
had
always
valued
highly
,
which
must
have
stamped
him
well
in
the
esteem
of
every
listener
,
had
been
followed
by
a
little
history
of
his
private
life
,
which
rendered
him
perfectly
interesting
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
engaged
to
Captain
Harville
's
sister
,
and
was
now
mourning
her
loss
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
a
year
or
two
waiting
for
fortune
and
promotion
.
<EOS>
Fortune
came
,
his
prize
-
money
as
lieutenant
being
great
;
promotion
,
too
,
came
at
last
;
but
Fanny
Harville
did
not
live
to
know
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
died
the
preceding
summer
while
he
was
at
sea
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
believed
it
impossible
for
man
to
be
more
attached
to
woman
than
poor
Benwick
had
been
to
Fanny
Harville
,
or
to
be
more
deeply
afflicted
under
the
dreadful
change
.
<EOS>
He
considered
his
disposition
as
of
the
sort
which
must
suffer
heavily
,
uniting
very
strong
feelings
with
quiet
,
serious
,
and
retiring
manners
,
and
a
decided
taste
for
reading
,
and
sedentary
pursuits
.
<EOS>
To
finish
the
interest
of
the
story
,
the
friendship
between
him
and
the
Harvilles
seemed
,
if
possible
,
augmented
by
the
event
which
closed
all
their
views
of
alliance
,
and
Captain
Benwick
was
now
living
with
them
entirely
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
had
taken
his
present
house
for
half
a
year
;
his
taste
,
and
his
health
,
and
his
fortune
,
all
directing
him
to
a
residence
inexpensive
,
and
by
the
sea
;
and
the
grandeur
of
the
country
,
and
the
retirement
of
Lyme
in
the
winter
,
appeared
exactly
adapted
to
Captain
Benwick
's
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
The
sympathy
and
good
-
will
excited
towards
Captain
Benwick
was
very
great
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
"
said
Anne
to
herself
,
as
they
now
moved
forward
to
meet
the
party
,
"
he
has
not
,
perhaps
,
a
more
sorrowing
heart
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
his
prospects
so
blighted
for
ever
.
<EOS>
He
is
younger
than
I
am
;
younger
in
feeling
,
if
not
in
fact
;
younger
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
He
will
rally
again
,
and
be
happy
with
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
met
,
and
were
introduced
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
was
a
tall
,
dark
man
,
with
a
sensible
,
benevolent
countenance
;
a
little
lame
;
and
from
strong
features
and
want
of
health
,
looking
much
older
than
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
looked
,
and
was
,
the
youngest
of
the
three
,
and
,
compared
with
either
of
them
,
a
little
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
pleasing
face
and
a
melancholy
air
,
just
as
he
ought
to
have
,
and
drew
back
from
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
,
though
not
equalling
Captain
Wentworth
in
manners
,
was
a
perfect
gentleman
,
unaffected
,
warm
,
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
,
a
degree
less
polished
than
her
husband
,
seemed
,
however
,
to
have
the
same
good
feelings
;
and
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
than
their
desire
of
considering
the
whole
party
as
friends
of
their
own
,
because
the
friends
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
or
more
kindly
hospitable
than
their
entreaties
for
their
all
promising
to
dine
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
,
already
ordered
at
the
inn
,
was
at
last
,
though
unwillingly
,
accepted
as
a
excuse
;
but
they
seemed
almost
hurt
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
have
brought
any
such
party
to
Lyme
,
without
considering
it
as
a
thing
of
course
that
they
should
dine
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
so
much
attachment
to
Captain
Wentworth
in
all
this
,
and
such
a
bewitching
charm
in
a
degree
of
hospitality
so
uncommon
,
so
unlike
the
usual
style
of
give
-
and
-
take
invitations
,
and
dinners
of
formality
and
display
,
that
Anne
felt
her
spirits
not
likely
to
be
benefited
by
an
increasing
acquaintance
among
his
brother
-
officers
.
<EOS>
"
These
would
have
been
all
my
friends
,
"
was
her
thought
;
and
she
had
to
struggle
against
a
great
tendency
to
lowness
.
  
<EOS>
On
quitting
the
Cobb
,
they
all
went
in
-
doors
with
their
new
friends
,
and
found
rooms
so
small
as
none
but
those
who
invite
from
the
heart
could
think
capable
of
accommodating
so
many
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
a
moment
's
astonishment
on
the
subject
herself
;
but
it
was
soon
lost
in
the
pleasanter
feelings
which
sprang
from
the
sight
of
all
the
ingenious
contrivances
and
nice
arrangements
of
Captain
Harville
,
to
turn
the
actual
space
to
the
best
account
,
to
supply
the
deficiencies
of
lodging
-
house
furniture
,
and
defend
the
windows
and
doors
against
the
winter
storms
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
The
varieties
in
the
fitting
-
up
of
the
rooms
,
where
the
common
necessaries
provided
by
the
owner
,
in
the
common
indifferent
plight
,
were
contrasted
with
some
few
articles
of
a
rare
species
of
wood
,
excellently
worked
up
,
and
with
something
curious
and
valuable
from
all
the
distant
countries
Captain
Harville
had
visited
,
were
more
than
amusing
to
Anne
;
connected
as
it
all
was
with
his
profession
,
the
fruit
of
its
labours
,
the
effect
of
its
influence
on
his
habits
,
the
picture
of
repose
and
domestic
happiness
it
presented
,
made
it
to
her
a
something
more
,
or
less
,
than
gratification
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
was
no
reader
;
but
he
had
contrived
excellent
accommodations
,
and
fashioned
very
pretty
shelves
,
for
a
tolerable
collection
of
well
-
bound
volumes
,
the
property
of
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
His
lameness
prevented
him
from
taking
much
exercise
;
but
a
mind
of
usefulness
and
ingenuity
seemed
to
furnish
him
with
constant
employment
within
.
<EOS>
He
drew
,
he
varnished
<EOS>
,
he
carpentered
,
he
glued
;
he
made
toys
for
the
children
;
he
fashioned
new
netting
-
needles
and
pins
with
improvements
;
and
if
everything
else
was
done
,
sat
down
to
his
large
fishing
-
net
at
one
corner
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
thought
she
left
great
happiness
behind
her
when
they
quitted
the
house
;
and
Louisa
,
by
whom
she
found
herself
walking
,
burst
forth
into
raptures
of
admiration
and
delight
on
the
character
of
the
navy
;
their
friendliness
,
their
brotherliness
,
their
openness
,
their
uprightness
;
protesting
that
she
was
convinced
of
sailors
having
more
worth
and
warmth
than
any
other
set
of
men
in
England
;
that
they
only
knew
how
to
live
,
and
they
only
deserved
to
be
respected
and
loved
.
  
<EOS>
They
went
back
to
dress
and
dine
;
and
so
well
had
the
scheme
answered
already
,
that
nothing
was
found
amiss
;
though
its
being
"
so
entirely
out
of
season
,
"
and
the
"
no
thoroughfare
of
Lyme
,
"
and
the
"
no
expectation
of
company
,
"
had
brought
many
apologies
from
the
heads
of
the
inn
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
found
herself
by
this
time
growing
so
much
more
hardened
to
being
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
company
than
she
had
at
first
imagined
could
ever
be
,
that
the
sitting
down
to
the
same
table
with
him
now
,
and
the
interchange
of
the
common
civilities
attending
on
it
(
they
never
got
beyond
)
,
was
become
a
mere
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
The
nights
were
too
dark
for
the
ladies
to
meet
again
till
the
morrow
,
but
Captain
Harville
had
promised
them
a
visit
in
the
evening
;
and
he
came
,
bringing
his
friend
also
,
which
was
more
than
had
been
expected
,
it
having
been
agreed
that
Captain
Benwick
had
all
the
appearance
of
being
oppressed
by
the
presence
of
so
many
strangers
.
<EOS>
He
ventured
among
them
again
,
however
,
though
his
spirits
certainly
did
not
seem
fit
for
the
mirth
of
the
party
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
While
Captains
Wentworth
and
Harville
led
the
talk
on
one
side
of
the
room
,
and
by
recurring
to
former
days
,
supplied
anecdotes
in
abundance
to
occupy
and
entertain
the
others
,
it
fell
to
Anne
's
lot
to
be
placed
rather
apart
with
Captain
Benwick
;
and
a
very
good
impulse
of
her
nature
obliged
her
to
begin
an
acquaintance
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
shy
,
and
disposed
to
abstraction
;
but
the
engaging
mildness
of
her
countenance
,
and
gentleness
of
her
manners
,
soon
had
their
effect
;
and
Anne
was
well
repaid
the
first
trouble
of
exertion
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
a
young
man
of
considerable
taste
in
reading
,
though
principally
in
poetry
;
and
besides
the
persuasion
of
having
given
him
at
least
an
evening
's
indulgence
in
the
discussion
of
subjects
,
which
his
usual
companions
had
probably
no
concern
in
<EOS>
,
she
had
the
hope
of
being
of
real
use
to
him
in
some
suggestions
as
to
the
duty
and
benefit
of
struggling
against
affliction
,
which
had
naturally
grown
out
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
For
,
though
shy
,
he
did
not
seem
reserved
;
it
had
rather
the
appearance
of
feelings
glad
to
burst
their
usual
restraints
;
and
having
talked
of
poetry
,
the
richness
of
the
present
age
,
and
gone
through
a
brief
comparison
of
opinion
as
to
the
first
-
rate
poets
,
trying
to
ascertain
whether
Marmion
or
The
Lady
of
the
Lake
were
to
be
preferred
,
and
how
ranked
the
Giaour
and
The
Bride
of
Abydos
;
and
moreover
,
how
the
Giaour
was
to
be
pronounced
,
he
showed
himself
so
intimately
acquainted
with
all
the
tenderest
songs
of
the
one
poet
,
and
all
the
impassioned
descriptions
of
hopeless
agony
of
the
other
;
he
repeated
,
with
such
tremulous
feeling
,
the
various
lines
which
imaged
a
broken
heart
,
or
a
mind
destroyed
by
wretchedness
,
and
looked
so
entirely
as
if
he
meant
to
be
understood
,
that
she
ventured
to
hope
he
did
not
always
read
only
poetry
,
and
to
say
,
that
she
thought
it
was
the
misfortune
of
poetry
to
be
seldom
safely
enjoyed
by
those
who
enjoyed
it
completely
;
and
that
the
strong
feelings
which
alone
could
estimate
it
truly
were
the
very
feelings
which
ought
to
taste
it
but
sparingly
.
  
<EOS>
His
looks
shewing
him
not
pained
,
but
pleased
with
this
allusion
to
his
situation
,
she
was
emboldened
to
go
on
;
and
feeling
in
herself
the
right
of
seniority
of
mind
<EOS>
,
she
ventured
to
recommend
a
larger
allowance
of
prose
in
his
daily
study
;
and
on
being
requested
to
particularize
,
mentioned
such
works
of
our
best
moralists
,
such
collections
of
the
finest
letters
,
such
memoirs
of
characters
of
worth
and
suffering
,
as
occurred
to
her
at
the
moment
as
calculated
to
rouse
and
fortify
the
mind
by
the
highest
precepts
,
and
the
strongest
examples
of
moral
and
religious
endurances
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
listened
attentively
,
and
seemed
grateful
for
the
interest
implied
;
and
though
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
and
sighs
which
declared
his
little
faith
in
the
efficacy
of
any
books
on
grief
like
his
,
noted
down
the
names
of
those
she
recommended
,
and
promised
to
procure
and
read
them
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
evening
was
over
,
Anne
could
not
but
be
amused
at
the
idea
of
her
coming
to
Lyme
to
preach
patience
and
resignation
to
a
young
man
whom
she
had
never
seen
before
;
nor
could
she
help
fearing
,
on
more
serious
reflection
,
that
,
like
many
other
great
moralists
and
preachers
,
she
had
been
eloquent
on
a
point
in
which
her
own
conduct
would
ill
bear
examination
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
and
Henrietta
,
finding
themselves
the
earliest
of
the
party
the
next
morning
,
agreed
to
stroll
down
to
the
sea
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
They
went
to
the
sands
,
to
watch
the
flowing
of
the
tide
,
which
a
fine
south
-
easterly
breeze
was
bringing
in
with
all
the
grandeur
which
so
flat
a
shore
admitted
.
<EOS>
They
praised
the
morning
;
gloried
in
the
sea
;
sympathized
in
the
delight
of
the
fresh
-
feeling
breeze
 
and
were
silent
;
till
Henrietta
suddenly
began
again
with
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
 
I
am
quite
convinced
that
,
with
very
few
exceptions
,
the
sea
-
air
always
does
good
.
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
its
having
been
of
the
greatest
service
to
Dr
Shirley
,
after
his
illness
,
last
spring
twelve
-
month
.
<EOS>
He
declares
himself
,
that
coming
to
Lyme
for
a
month
,
did
him
more
good
than
all
the
medicine
he
took
;
and
,
that
being
by
the
sea
,
always
makes
him
feel
young
again
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
can
not
help
thinking
it
a
pity
that
he
does
not
live
entirely
by
the
sea
.
<EOS>
I
do
think
he
had
better
leave
Uppercross
entirely
,
and
fix
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
,
Anne
?
<EOS>
Do
not
you
agree
with
me
,
that
it
is
the
best
thing
he
could
do
,
both
for
himself
and
Mrs
Shirley
?
<EOS>
She
has
cousins
here
,
you
know
,
and
many
acquaintance
,
which
would
make
it
cheerful
for
her
,
and
I
am
sure
she
would
be
glad
to
get
to
a
place
where
she
could
have
medical
attendance
at
hand
,
in
case
of
his
having
another
seizure
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
think
it
quite
melancholy
to
have
such
excellent
people
as
Dr
and
Mrs
Shirley
,
who
have
been
doing
good
all
their
lives
,
wearing
out
their
last
days
in
a
place
like
Uppercross
,
where
,
excepting
our
family
,
they
seem
shut
out
from
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
wish
his
friends
would
propose
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
really
think
they
ought
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
to
procuring
a
dispensation
,
there
could
be
no
difficulty
at
his
time
of
life
,
and
with
his
character
.
<EOS>
My
only
doubt
is
,
whether
anything
could
persuade
him
to
leave
his
parish
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
very
strict
and
scrupulous
in
his
notions
;
over
-
scrupulous
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
,
Anne
,
it
is
being
over
-
scrupulous
?
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
it
is
quite
a
mistaken
point
of
conscience
,
when
a
clergyman
sacrifices
his
health
for
the
sake
of
duties
,
which
may
be
just
as
well
performed
by
another
person
?
<EOS>
And
at
Lyme
too
,
only
seventeen
miles
off
,
he
would
be
near
enough
to
hear
,
if
people
thought
there
was
anything
to
complain
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
smiled
more
than
once
to
herself
during
this
speech
,
and
entered
into
the
subject
,
as
ready
to
do
good
by
entering
into
the
feelings
of
a
young
lady
as
of
a
young
man
,
though
here
it
was
good
of
a
lower
standard
,
for
what
could
be
offered
but
general
acquiescence
?
<EOS>
She
said
all
that
was
reasonable
and
proper
on
the
business
;
felt
the
claims
of
Dr
Shirley
to
repose
as
she
ought
;
saw
how
very
desirable
it
was
that
he
should
have
some
active
,
respectable
young
man
,
as
a
resident
curate
,
and
was
even
courteous
enough
to
hint
at
the
advantage
of
such
resident
curate
's
being
married
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
,
"
said
Henrietta
,
very
well
pleased
with
her
companion
,
"
I
wish
Lady
Russell
lived
at
Uppercross
,
and
were
intimate
with
Dr
Shirley
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
heard
of
Lady
Russell
as
a
woman
of
the
greatest
influence
with
everybody
!
<EOS>
I
always
look
upon
her
as
able
to
persuade
a
person
to
anything
!
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
of
her
,
as
I
have
told
you
before
,
quite
afraid
of
her
,
because
she
is
so
very
clever
;
but
I
respect
her
amazingly
,
and
wish
we
had
such
a
neighbour
at
Uppercross
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
amused
by
Henrietta
's
manner
of
being
grateful
,
and
amused
also
that
the
course
of
events
and
the
new
interests
of
Henrietta
's
views
should
have
placed
her
friend
at
all
in
favour
with
any
of
the
Musgrove
family
;
she
had
only
time
,
however
,
for
a
general
answer
,
and
a
wish
that
such
another
woman
were
at
Uppercross
,
before
all
subjects
suddenly
ceased
,
on
seeing
Louisa
and
Captain
Wentworth
coming
towards
them
.
<EOS>
They
came
also
for
a
stroll
till
breakfast
was
likely
to
be
ready
;
but
Louisa
recollecting
,
immediately
afterwards
that
she
had
something
to
procure
at
a
shop
,
invited
them
all
to
go
back
with
her
into
the
town
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
at
her
disposal
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
the
steps
,
leading
upwards
from
the
beach
,
a
gentleman
,
at
the
same
moment
preparing
to
come
down
,
politely
drew
back
,
and
stopped
to
give
them
way
.
<EOS>
They
ascended
and
passed
him
;
and
as
they
passed
,
Anne
's
face
caught
his
eye
,
and
he
looked
at
her
with
a
degree
of
earnest
admiration
,
which
she
could
not
be
insensible
of
.
<EOS>
She
was
looking
remarkably
well
;
<EOS>
her
very
regular
,
very
pretty
features
,
having
the
bloom
and
freshness
of
youth
restored
by
the
fine
wind
which
had
been
blowing
on
her
complexion
,
and
by
the
animation
of
eye
which
it
had
also
produced
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
the
gentleman
,
(
completely
a
gentleman
in
manner
)
admired
her
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
looked
round
at
her
instantly
in
a
way
which
shewed
his
noticing
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
a
momentary
glance
,
a
glance
of
brightness
,
which
seemed
to
say
,
"
That
man
is
struck
with
you
,
and
even
I
,
at
this
moment
,
see
something
like
Anne
Elliot
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
attending
Louisa
through
her
business
,
and
loitering
about
a
little
longer
,
they
returned
to
the
inn
;
and
Anne
,
in
passing
afterwards
quickly
from
her
own
chamber
to
their
dining
-
room
,
had
nearly
run
against
the
very
same
gentleman
,
as
he
came
out
of
an
adjoining
apartment
.
<EOS>
She
had
before
conjectured
him
to
be
a
stranger
like
themselves
,
and
determined
that
a
well
-
looking
groom
,
who
was
strolling
about
near
the
two
inns
as
they
came
back
,
should
be
his
servant
.
<EOS>
Both
master
and
man
being
in
mourning
assisted
the
idea
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
proved
that
he
belonged
to
the
same
inn
as
themselves
;
and
this
second
meeting
,
short
as
it
was
,
also
proved
again
by
the
gentleman
's
looks
,
that
he
thought
hers
very
lovely
,
and
by
the
readiness
and
propriety
of
his
apologies
,
that
he
was
a
man
of
exceedingly
good
manners
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
about
thirty
,
and
though
not
handsome
,
had
an
agreeable
person
.
<EOS>
Anne
felt
that
she
should
like
to
know
who
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
nearly
done
breakfast
,
when
the
sound
of
a
carriage
,
(
almost
the
first
they
had
heard
since
entering
Lyme
)
drew
half
the
party
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
gentleman
's
carriage
,
a
curricle
,
but
only
coming
round
from
the
stable
-
yard
to
the
front
door
;
somebody
must
be
going
away
.
<EOS>
It
was
driven
by
a
servant
in
mourning
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
curricle
made
Charles
Musgrove
jump
up
that
he
might
compare
it
with
his
own
;
the
servant
in
mourning
roused
Anne
's
curiosity
,
and
the
whole
six
were
collected
to
look
,
by
the
time
the
owner
of
the
curricle
was
to
be
seen
issuing
from
the
door
amidst
the
bows
and
civilities
of
the
household
,
and
taking
his
seat
,
to
drive
off
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Captain
Wentworth
,
instantly
,
and
with
half
a
glance
at
Anne
,
<EOS>
"
it
is
the
very
man
we
passed
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Miss
Musgroves
agreed
to
it
;
and
having
all
kindly
watched
him
as
far
up
the
hill
as
they
could
,
they
returned
to
the
breakfast
table
.
<EOS>
The
waiter
came
into
the
room
soon
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
said
Captain
Wentworth
,
immediately
,
"
can
you
tell
us
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
is
just
gone
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Sir
,
a
Mr
Elliot
,
a
gentleman
of
large
fortune
,
came
in
last
night
from
Sidmouth
.
<EOS>
Dare
say
you
heard
the
carriage
,
sir
,
while
you
were
at
dinner
;
and
going
on
now
for
Crewkherne
,
in
his
way
to
Bath
and
London
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Elliot
!
"
<EOS>
Many
had
looked
on
each
other
,
and
many
had
repeated
the
name
,
before
all
this
had
been
got
through
,
even
by
the
smart
rapidity
of
a
waiter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mary
;
"
it
must
be
our
cousin
;
it
must
be
our
Mr
Elliot
,
it
must
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Charles
,
Anne
,
must
not
it
?
<EOS>
In
mourning
,
you
see
,
just
as
our
Mr
Elliot
must
be
.
<EOS>
How
very
extraordinary
!
<EOS>
In
the
very
same
inn
with
us
!
<EOS>
Anne
,
must
not
it
be
our
Mr
Elliot
?
<EOS>
my
father
's
next
heir
?
<EOS>
Pray
sir
,
"
turning
to
the
waiter
,
<EOS>
"
did
not
you
hear
,
did
not
his
servant
say
whether
he
belonged
to
the
Kellynch
family
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
ma'am
,
he
did
not
mention
no
particular
family
;
but
he
said
his
master
was
a
very
rich
gentleman
,
and
would
be
a
baronight
some
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
There
!
you
see
!
"
cried
Mary
in
an
ecstasy
,
"
just
as
I
said
!
<EOS>
Heir
to
Sir
Walter
Elliot
!
<EOS>
I
was
sure
that
would
come
out
,
if
it
was
so
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
that
is
a
circumstance
which
his
servants
take
care
to
publish
,
wherever
he
goes
.
<EOS>
But
,
Anne
,
only
conceive
how
extraordinary
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
looked
at
him
more
.
<EOS>
I
wish
we
had
been
aware
in
time
,
who
it
was
,
that
he
might
have
been
introduced
to
us
.
<EOS>
What
a
pity
that
we
should
not
have
been
introduced
to
each
other
!
<EOS>
Do
you
think
he
had
the
Elliot
countenance
?
<EOS>
I
hardly
looked
at
him
,
I
was
looking
at
the
horses
;
but
I
think
he
had
something
of
the
Elliot
countenance
<EOS>
,
I
wonder
the
arms
did
not
strike
me
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
the
great
-
coat
was
hanging
over
the
panel
,
and
hid
the
arms
,
so
it
did
;
otherwise
,
I
am
sure
,
I
should
have
observed
them
,
and
the
livery
too
;
if
the
servant
had
not
been
in
mourning
,
one
should
have
known
him
by
the
livery
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Putting
all
these
very
extraordinary
circumstances
together
,
"
said
Captain
Wentworth
,
"
we
must
consider
it
to
be
the
arrangement
of
Providence
,
that
you
should
not
be
introduced
to
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
she
could
command
Mary
's
attention
,
Anne
quietly
tried
to
convince
her
that
their
father
and
Mr
Elliot
had
not
,
for
many
years
,
been
on
such
terms
as
to
make
the
power
of
attempting
an
introduction
at
all
desirable
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
however
,
it
was
a
secret
gratification
to
herself
to
have
seen
her
cousin
,
and
to
know
that
the
future
owner
of
Kellynch
was
undoubtedly
a
gentleman
,
and
had
an
air
of
good
sense
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
upon
any
account
,
mention
her
having
met
with
him
the
second
time
;
luckily
Mary
did
not
much
attend
to
their
having
passed
close
by
him
in
their
earlier
walk
,
but
she
would
have
felt
quite
ill
-
used
by
Anne
's
having
actually
run
against
him
in
the
passage
,
and
received
his
very
polite
excuses
,
while
she
had
never
been
near
him
at
all
;
no
,
that
cousinly
little
interview
must
remain
a
perfect
secret
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
you
will
mention
our
seeing
Mr
Elliot
,
the
next
time
you
write
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
I
think
my
father
certainly
ought
to
hear
of
it
;
do
mention
all
about
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
avoided
a
direct
reply
,
but
it
was
just
the
circumstance
which
she
considered
as
not
merely
unnecessary
to
be
communicated
,
but
as
what
ought
to
be
suppressed
.
<EOS>
The
offence
which
had
been
given
her
father
,
many
years
back
,
she
knew
;
Elizabeth
's
particular
share
in
it
she
suspected
;
and
that
Mr
Elliot
's
idea
always
produced
irritation
in
both
was
beyond
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Mary
never
wrote
to
Bath
herself
;
all
the
toil
of
keeping
up
a
slow
and
unsatisfactory
correspondence
with
Elizabeth
fell
on
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
Breakfast
had
not
been
long
over
,
when
they
were
joined
by
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
and
Captain
Benwick
;
with
whom
they
had
appointed
to
take
their
last
walk
about
Lyme
.
<EOS>
They
ought
to
be
setting
off
for
Uppercross
by
one
,
and
in
the
mean
while
were
to
be
all
together
,
and
out
of
doors
as
long
as
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
found
Captain
Benwick
getting
near
her
,
as
soon
as
they
were
all
fairly
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
Their
conversation
the
preceding
evening
did
not
disincline
him
to
seek
her
again
;
and
they
walked
together
some
time
,
talking
as
before
of
Mr
Scott
and
Lord
Byron
,
and
still
as
unable
as
before
,
and
as
unable
as
any
other
two
readers
,
to
think
exactly
alike
of
the
merits
of
either
,
till
something
occasioned
an
almost
general
change
amongst
their
party
,
and
instead
of
Captain
Benwick
<EOS>
,
she
had
Captain
Harville
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Elliot
,
"
said
he
,
speaking
rather
low
,
"
you
have
done
a
good
deed
in
making
that
poor
fellow
talk
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
could
have
such
company
oftener
.
<EOS>
It
is
bad
for
him
,
I
know
,
to
be
shut
up
as
he
is
;
but
what
can
we
do
?
<EOS>
We
can
not
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
that
I
can
easily
believe
to
be
impossible
;
but
in
time
,
perhaps
 
we
know
what
time
does
in
every
case
of
affliction
,
and
you
must
remember
,
Captain
Harville
,
that
your
friend
may
yet
be
called
a
young
mourner
 
only
last
summer
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ay
,
true
enough
,
"
(
with
a
deep
sigh
)
"
only
June
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
not
known
to
him
,
perhaps
,
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
till
the
first
week
of
August
,
when
he
came
home
from
the
Cape
,
just
made
into
the
Grappler
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
Plymouth
dreading
to
hear
of
him
;
he
sent
in
letters
,
but
the
Grappler
was
under
orders
for
Portsmouth
.
<EOS>
There
the
news
must
follow
him
,
but
who
was
to
tell
it
?
<EOS>
not
I.
I
would
as
soon
have
been
run
up
to
the
yard
-
arm
.
<EOS>
Nobody
could
do
it
,
but
that
good
fellow
"
(
pointing
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
)
<EOS>
"
The
Laconia
had
come
into
Plymouth
the
week
before
;
no
danger
of
her
being
sent
to
sea
again
.
<EOS>
He
stood
his
chance
for
the
rest
;
wrote
up
for
leave
of
absence
,
but
without
waiting
the
return
,
travelled
night
and
day
till
he
got
to
Portsmouth
,
rowed
off
to
the
Grappler
that
instant
,
and
never
left
the
poor
fellow
for
a
week
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
he
did
,
and
nobody
else
could
have
saved
poor
James
.
<EOS>
You
may
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
whether
he
is
dear
to
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
did
think
on
the
question
with
perfect
decision
,
and
said
as
much
in
reply
as
her
own
feeling
could
accomplish
,
or
as
his
seemed
able
to
bear
,
for
he
was
too
much
affected
to
renew
the
subject
,
and
when
he
spoke
again
,
it
was
of
something
totally
different
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
's
giving
it
as
her
opinion
that
her
husband
would
have
quite
walking
enough
by
the
time
he
reached
home
,
determined
the
direction
of
all
the
party
in
what
was
to
be
their
last
walk
;
they
would
accompany
them
to
their
door
,
and
then
return
and
set
off
themselves
.
<EOS>
By
all
their
calculations
there
was
just
time
for
this
;
but
as
they
drew
near
the
Cobb
,
there
was
such
a
general
wish
to
walk
along
it
once
more
,
<EOS>
all
were
so
inclined
,
and
Louisa
soon
grew
so
determined
,
that
the
difference
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
it
was
found
,
would
be
no
difference
at
all
;
so
with
all
the
kind
leave
-
taking
,
and
all
the
kind
interchange
of
invitations
and
promises
which
may
be
imagined
,
they
parted
from
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
at
their
own
door
,
and
still
accompanied
by
Captain
Benwick
,
who
seemed
to
cling
to
them
to
the
last
,
proceeded
to
make
the
proper
adieus
to
the
Cobb
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
found
Captain
Benwick
again
drawing
near
her
.
<EOS>
Lord
Byron
's
"
dark
blue
seas
"
could
not
fail
of
being
brought
forward
by
their
present
view
,
and
she
gladly
gave
him
all
her
attention
as
long
as
attention
was
possible
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
drawn
,
perforce
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
too
much
wind
to
make
the
high
part
of
the
new
Cobb
pleasant
for
the
ladies
,
and
they
agreed
to
get
down
the
steps
to
the
lower
,
and
all
were
contented
to
pass
quietly
and
carefully
down
the
steep
flight
,
excepting
Louisa
;
she
must
be
jumped
down
them
by
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
In
all
their
walks
,
he
had
had
to
jump
her
from
the
stiles
;
the
sensation
was
delightful
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
hardness
of
the
pavement
for
her
feet
,
made
him
less
willing
upon
the
present
occasion
;
he
did
it
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
was
safely
down
,
and
instantly
,
to
show
her
enjoyment
,
ran
up
the
steps
to
be
jumped
down
again
.
<EOS>
He
advised
her
against
it
,
thought
the
jar
too
great
;
but
no
,
he
reasoned
and
talked
in
vain
,
she
smiled
and
said
,
"
I
am
determined
I
will
:
"
he
put
out
his
hands
;
she
was
too
precipitate
by
half
a
second
,
she
fell
on
the
pavement
on
the
Lower
Cobb
,
and
was
taken
up
lifeless
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
wound
,
no
blood
,
no
visible
bruise
;
but
her
eyes
were
closed
,
she
breathed
not
,
her
face
was
like
death
.
<EOS>
The
horror
of
the
moment
to
all
who
stood
around
!
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
who
had
caught
her
up
,
knelt
with
her
in
his
arms
,
looking
on
her
with
a
face
as
pallid
as
her
own
,
in
an
agony
of
silence
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
dead
!
<EOS>
she
is
dead
!
"
<EOS>
screamed
Mary
,
catching
hold
of
her
husband
,
and
contributing
with
his
own
horror
to
make
him
immoveable
;
and
in
another
moment
,
Henrietta
,
sinking
under
the
conviction
,
lost
her
senses
too
,
and
would
have
fallen
on
the
steps
,
but
for
Captain
Benwick
and
Anne
,
who
caught
and
supported
her
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
one
to
help
me
?
"
were
the
first
words
which
burst
from
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
tone
of
despair
,
and
as
if
all
his
own
strength
were
gone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
to
him
,
go
to
him
,
"
cried
Anne
,
"
<EOS>
for
heaven
's
sake
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
support
her
myself
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
,
and
go
to
him
.
<EOS>
Rub
her
hands
,
rub
her
temples
;
here
are
salts
;
take
them
,
take
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
obeyed
,
and
Charles
at
the
same
moment
,
disengaging
himself
from
his
wife
,
they
were
both
with
him
;
and
Louisa
was
raised
up
and
supported
more
firmly
between
them
,
and
everything
was
done
that
Anne
had
prompted
,
but
in
vain
;
while
Captain
Wentworth
,
staggering
against
the
wall
for
his
support
,
exclaimed
in
the
bitterest
agony
    
"
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
her
father
and
mother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
surgeon
!
"
said
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
He
caught
the
word
;
it
seemed
to
rouse
him
at
once
,
and
saying
only
  
"
True
,
true
,
a
surgeon
this
instant
,
"
was
darting
away
,
when
Anne
eagerly
suggested
    
"
Captain
Benwick
,
would
not
it
be
better
for
Captain
Benwick
?
<EOS>
He
knows
where
a
surgeon
is
to
be
found
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
one
capable
of
thinking
felt
the
advantage
of
the
idea
,
and
in
a
moment
(
it
was
all
done
in
rapid
moments
)
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
had
resigned
the
poor
corpse
-
like
figure
entirely
to
the
brother
's
care
,
and
was
off
for
the
town
with
the
utmost
rapidity
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
wretched
party
left
behind
,
it
could
scarcely
be
said
which
of
the
three
,
who
were
completely
rational
,
was
suffering
most
:
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
Anne
,
or
Charles
,
who
,
really
a
very
affectionate
brother
,
hung
over
Louisa
with
sobs
of
grief
,
and
could
only
turn
his
eyes
from
one
sister
,
to
see
the
other
in
a
state
as
insensible
,
or
to
witness
the
hysterical
agitations
of
his
wife
,
calling
on
him
for
help
which
he
could
not
give
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
attending
with
all
the
strength
and
zeal
,
and
thought
,
which
instinct
supplied
,
to
Henrietta
,
still
tried
,
at
intervals
,
to
suggest
comfort
to
the
others
,
tried
to
quiet
Mary
,
to
animate
Charles
,
to
assuage
the
feelings
of
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
Both
seemed
to
look
to
her
for
directions
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anne
,
Anne
,
"
cried
Charles
,
"
What
is
to
be
done
next
?
<EOS>
What
,
in
heaven
's
name
,
is
to
be
done
next
?
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
's
eyes
were
also
turned
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Had
not
she
better
be
carried
to
the
inn
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
am
sure
:
carry
her
gently
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
to
the
inn
,
"
repeated
Captain
Wentworth
,
comparatively
collected
,
and
eager
to
be
doing
something
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
carry
her
myself
.
<EOS>
Musgrove
,
take
care
of
the
others
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
report
of
the
accident
had
spread
among
the
workmen
and
boatmen
about
the
Cobb
,
and
many
were
collected
near
them
,
to
be
useful
if
wanted
,
at
any
rate
,
to
enjoy
the
sight
of
a
dead
young
lady
,
nay
,
two
dead
young
ladies
,
for
it
proved
twice
as
fine
as
the
first
report
.
<EOS>
To
some
of
the
best
-
looking
of
these
good
people
Henrietta
was
consigned
,
for
,
though
partially
revived
,
she
was
quite
helpless
;
and
in
this
manner
,
Anne
walking
by
her
side
,
and
Charles
attending
to
his
wife
,
they
set
forward
,
treading
back
with
feelings
unutterable
,
the
ground
,
which
so
lately
,
so
very
lately
,
and
so
light
of
heart
,
they
had
passed
along
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
not
off
the
Cobb
,
before
the
Harvilles
met
them
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
had
been
seen
flying
by
their
house
,
with
a
countenance
which
showed
something
to
be
wrong
;
and
they
had
set
off
immediately
,
informed
and
directed
as
they
passed
,
towards
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Shocked
as
Captain
Harville
was
,
he
brought
senses
and
nerves
that
could
be
instantly
useful
;
and
a
look
between
him
and
<EOS>
his
wife
decided
what
was
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
taken
to
their
house
;
all
must
go
to
their
house
;
and
await
the
surgeon
's
arrival
there
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
listen
to
scruples
:
he
was
obeyed
;
they
were
all
beneath
his
roof
;
and
while
Louisa
,
under
Mrs
Harville
's
direction
,
was
conveyed
up
stairs
,
and
given
possession
of
her
own
bed
,
assistance
,
cordials
,
restoratives
were
supplied
by
her
husband
to
all
who
needed
them
.
  
<EOS>
Louisa
had
once
opened
her
eyes
,
but
soon
closed
them
again
,
without
apparent
consciousness
.
<EOS>
This
had
been
a
proof
of
life
,
however
,
of
service
to
her
sister
;
and
Henrietta
,
though
perfectly
incapable
of
being
in
the
same
room
with
Louisa
,
was
kept
,
by
the
agitation
of
hope
and
fear
,
from
a
return
of
her
own
insensibility
.
<EOS>
Mary
,
too
,
was
growing
calmer
.
  
<EOS>
The
surgeon
was
with
them
almost
before
it
had
seemed
possible
.
<EOS>
They
were
sick
with
horror
,
while
he
examined
;
but
he
was
not
hopeless
.
<EOS>
The
head
had
received
a
severe
contusion
,
but
he
had
seen
greater
injuries
recovered
from
:
he
was
by
no
means
hopeless
;
he
spoke
cheerfully
.
  
<EOS>
That
he
did
not
regard
it
as
a
desperate
case
,
that
he
did
not
say
a
few
hours
must
end
it
,
was
at
first
felt
,
beyond
the
hope
of
most
;
and
the
ecstasy
of
such
a
reprieve
,
the
rejoicing
,
deep
and
silent
,
after
a
few
fervent
ejaculations
of
gratitude
to
Heaven
had
been
offered
,
may
be
conceived
.
  
<EOS>
The
tone
,
the
look
,
with
which
"
Thank
God
!
"
was
uttered
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
Anne
was
sure
could
never
be
forgotten
by
her
;
nor
the
sight
of
him
afterwards
,
as
he
sat
near
a
table
,
leaning
over
it
with
folded
arms
and
face
concealed
,
as
if
overpowered
by
the
various
feelings
of
his
soul
,
and
trying
by
prayer
and
reflection
to
calm
them
.
  
<EOS>
Louisa
's
limbs
had
escaped
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
injury
but
to
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
It
now
became
necessary
for
the
party
to
consider
what
was
best
to
be
done
,
as
to
their
general
situation
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
able
to
speak
to
each
other
and
consult
.
<EOS>
That
Louisa
must
remain
where
she
was
,
however
distressing
to
her
friends
to
be
involving
the
Harvilles
in
such
trouble
,
did
not
admit
a
doubt
.
<EOS>
Her
removal
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
The
Harvilles
silenced
all
scruples
;
and
,
as
much
as
they
could
,
all
gratitude
.
<EOS>
They
had
looked
forward
and
arranged
everything
before
the
others
began
to
reflect
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
must
give
up
his
room
to
them
,
and
get
another
bed
elsewhere
;
and
the
whole
was
settled
.
<EOS>
They
were
only
concerned
that
the
house
could
accommodate
no
more
;
and
yet
perhaps
,
by
"
putting
the
children
away
in
the
maid
's
room
,
or
swinging
a
cot
somewhere
,
"
they
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of
not
finding
room
for
two
or
three
besides
,
supposing
they
might
wish
to
stay
;
though
,
with
regard
to
any
attendance
on
Miss
Musgrove
,
there
need
not
be
the
least
uneasiness
in
leaving
her
to
Mrs
Harville
's
care
entirely
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
was
a
very
experienced
nurse
,
and
her
nursery
-
maid
,
who
had
lived
with
her
long
,
and
gone
about
with
her
everywhere
,
was
just
such
another
.
<EOS>
Between
these
two
,
she
could
want
no
possible
attendance
by
day
or
night
.
<EOS>
And
all
this
was
said
with
a
truth
and
sincerity
of
feeling
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
,
Henrietta
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
were
the
three
in
consultation
,
and
for
a
little
while
it
was
only
an
interchange
of
perplexity
and
terror
.
<EOS>
"
Uppercross
,
the
necessity
of
some
one
's
going
to
Uppercross
;
the
news
to
be
conveyed
;
how
it
could
be
broken
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
;
the
lateness
of
the
morning
;
an
hour
already
gone
since
they
ought
to
have
been
off
;
the
impossibility
of
being
in
tolerable
time
.
<EOS>
"
At
first
,
they
were
capable
of
nothing
more
to
the
purpose
than
such
exclamations
;
but
,
after
a
while
,
Captain
Wentworth
,
exerting
himself
,
said
    
"
We
must
be
decided
,
and
without
the
loss
of
another
minute
.
<EOS>
Every
minute
is
valuable
.
<EOS>
Some
one
must
resolve
on
being
off
for
Uppercross
instantly
.
<EOS>
Musgrove
,
either
you
or
I
must
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
agreed
,
but
declared
his
resolution
of
not
going
away
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
as
little
incumbrance
as
possible
to
Captain
and
Mrs
Harville
;
but
as
to
leaving
his
sister
in
such
a
state
,
he
neither
ought
,
nor
would
.
<EOS>
So
far
it
was
decided
;
and
Henrietta
at
first
declared
the
same
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
was
soon
persuaded
to
think
differently
.
<EOS>
The
usefulness
of
her
staying
!
<EOS>
She
who
had
not
been
able
to
remain
in
Louisa
's
room
,
or
to
look
at
her
,
without
sufferings
which
made
her
worse
than
helpless
!
<EOS>
She
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
she
could
do
no
good
,
yet
was
still
unwilling
to
be
away
,
till
,
touched
by
the
thought
of
her
father
and
mother
<EOS>
,
she
gave
it
up
;
she
consented
,
she
was
anxious
to
be
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
plan
had
reached
this
point
,
when
Anne
,
coming
quietly
down
from
Louisa
's
room
,
could
not
but
hear
what
followed
,
for
the
parlour
door
was
open
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
is
settled
,
Musgrove
,
"
cried
Captain
Wentworth
,
"
that
you
stay
,
and
that
I
take
care
of
your
sister
home
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
the
rest
,
as
to
the
others
,
if
one
stays
to
assist
Mrs
Harville
,
I
think
it
need
be
only
one
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
will
,
of
course
,
wish
to
get
back
to
her
children
;
but
if
Anne
will
stay
,
no
one
so
proper
,
so
capable
as
Anne
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
to
recover
from
the
emotion
of
hearing
herself
so
spoken
of
.
<EOS>
The
other
two
warmly
agreed
with
what
he
said
,
and
she
then
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
stay
,
I
am
sure
;
you
will
stay
and
nurse
her
;
"
cried
he
,
turning
to
her
and
speaking
with
a
glow
,
and
yet
a
gentleness
,
which
seemed
almost
restoring
the
past
.
<EOS>
She
coloured
deeply
,
and
he
recollected
himself
and
moved
away
.
<EOS>
She
expressed
herself
most
willing
,
ready
,
happy
to
remain
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
what
she
had
been
thinking
of
,
and
wishing
to
be
allowed
to
do
.
<EOS>
A
bed
on
the
floor
in
Louisa
's
room
would
be
sufficient
for
her
,
if
Mrs
Harville
would
but
think
so
.
"
  
<EOS>
One
thing
more
,
and
all
seemed
arranged
.
<EOS>
Though
it
was
rather
desirable
that
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
should
be
previously
alarmed
by
some
share
of
delay
;
yet
the
time
required
by
the
Uppercross
horses
to
take
them
back
,
would
be
a
dreadful
extension
of
suspense
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
proposed
,
and
Charles
Musgrove
agreed
,
that
it
would
be
much
better
for
him
to
take
a
chaise
from
the
inn
,
and
leave
Mr
Musgrove
's
carriage
and
horses
to
be
sent
home
the
next
morning
early
,
when
there
would
be
the
farther
advantage
of
sending
an
account
of
Louisa
's
night
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
now
hurried
off
to
get
everything
ready
on
his
part
,
and
to
be
soon
followed
by
the
two
ladies
.
<EOS>
When
the
plan
was
made
known
to
Mary
,
however
,
there
was
an
end
of
all
peace
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
wretched
and
so
vehement
,
complained
so
much
of
injustice
in
being
expected
to
go
away
instead
of
Anne
;
Anne
,
who
was
nothing
to
Louisa
,
while
she
was
her
sister
,
and
had
the
best
right
to
stay
in
Henrietta
's
stead
!
<EOS>
Why
was
not
she
to
be
as
useful
as
Anne
?
<EOS>
And
to
go
home
without
Charles
,
too
,
without
her
husband
!
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
too
unkind
.
<EOS>
And
in
short
,
she
said
more
than
her
husband
could
long
withstand
,
and
as
none
of
the
others
could
oppose
when
he
gave
way
,
there
was
no
help
for
it
;
the
change
of
Mary
for
Anne
was
inevitable
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
never
submitted
more
reluctantly
to
the
jealous
and
ill
-
judging
claims
of
Mary
;
but
so
it
must
be
,
and
they
set
off
for
the
town
,
Charles
taking
care
of
his
sister
,
and
Captain
Benwick
attending
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
gave
a
moment
's
recollection
,
as
they
hurried
along
,
to
the
little
circumstances
which
the
same
spots
had
witnessed
earlier
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
There
she
had
listened
to
Henrietta
's
schemes
for
Dr
Shirley
's
leaving
Uppercross
;
farther
on
,
she
had
first
seen
Mr
Elliot
;
a
moment
seemed
all
that
could
now
be
given
to
any
one
but
Louisa
,
or
those
who
were
wrapt
up
in
her
welfare
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
was
most
considerately
attentive
to
her
;
and
,
united
as
they
all
seemed
by
the
distress
of
the
day
,
she
felt
an
increasing
degree
of
good
-
will
towards
him
,
and
a
pleasure
even
in
thinking
that
it
might
,
perhaps
,
be
the
occasion
of
continuing
their
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
was
on
the
watch
for
them
,
and
a
chaise
and
four
in
waiting
,
stationed
for
their
convenience
in
the
lowest
part
of
the
street
;
but
his
evident
surprise
and
vexation
at
the
substitution
of
one
sister
for
the
other
,
the
change
in
his
countenance
,
the
astonishment
,
the
expressions
begun
and
suppressed
,
with
which
Charles
was
listened
to
,
made
but
a
mortifying
reception
of
Anne
;
or
must
at
least
convince
her
that
she
was
valued
only
as
she
could
be
useful
to
Louisa
.
  
<EOS>
She
endeavoured
to
be
composed
,
and
to
be
just
.
<EOS>
Without
emulating
the
feelings
of
an
Emma
towards
her
Henry
,
she
would
have
attended
on
Louisa
with
a
zeal
above
the
common
claims
of
regard
,
for
his
sake
;
and
she
hoped
he
would
not
long
be
so
unjust
as
to
suppose
she
would
shrink
unnecessarily
from
the
office
of
a
friend
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
while
she
was
in
the
carriage
.
<EOS>
He
had
handed
them
both
in
,
and
placed
himself
between
them
;
and
in
this
manner
,
under
these
circumstances
,
full
of
astonishment
and
emotion
to
Anne
,
she
quitted
Lyme
.
<EOS>
How
the
long
stage
would
pass
;
how
it
was
to
affect
their
manners
;
what
was
to
be
their
sort
of
intercourse
,
she
could
not
foresee
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
quite
natural
,
however
.
<EOS>
He
was
devoted
to
Henrietta
;
always
turning
towards
her
;
and
when
he
spoke
at
all
,
always
with
the
view
of
supporting
her
hopes
and
raising
her
spirits
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
his
voice
and
manner
were
studiously
calm
.
<EOS>
To
spare
Henrietta
from
agitation
seemed
the
governing
principle
.
<EOS>
Once
only
,
when
she
had
been
grieving
over
the
last
ill
-
judged
,
ill
-
fated
walk
to
the
Cobb
,
bitterly
lamenting
that
it
ever
had
been
thought
of
,
he
burst
forth
,
as
if
wholly
overcome
    
"
Do
n't
talk
of
it
,
do
n't
talk
of
it
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
God
!
<EOS>
that
I
had
not
given
way
to
her
at
the
fatal
moment
!
<EOS>
Had
I
done
as
I
ought
!
<EOS>
But
so
eager
and
so
resolute
!
<EOS>
Dear
,
sweet
Louisa
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
wondered
whether
it
ever
occurred
to
him
now
,
to
question
the
justness
of
his
own
previous
opinion
as
to
the
universal
felicity
and
advantage
of
firmness
of
character
;
and
whether
it
might
not
strike
him
that
,
like
all
other
qualities
of
the
mind
,
it
should
have
its
proportions
and
limits
.
<EOS>
She
thought
it
could
scarcely
escape
him
to
feel
that
a
persuadable
temper
might
sometimes
be
as
much
in
favour
of
happiness
as
a
very
resolute
character
.
  
<EOS>
They
got
on
fast
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
astonished
to
recognise
the
same
hills
and
the
same
objects
so
soon
.
<EOS>
Their
actual
speed
,
heightened
by
some
dread
of
the
conclusion
,
made
the
road
appear
<EOS>
but
half
as
long
as
on
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
It
was
growing
quite
dusk
,
however
,
before
they
were
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Uppercross
,
and
there
had
been
total
silence
among
them
for
some
time
,
Henrietta
leaning
back
in
the
corner
,
with
a
shawl
over
her
face
,
giving
the
hope
of
her
having
cried
herself
to
sleep
;
when
,
as
they
were
going
up
their
last
hill
,
Anne
found
herself
all
at
once
addressed
by
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
In
a
low
,
cautious
voice
,
he
said
:
    
"
I
have
been
considering
what
we
had
best
do
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
appear
at
first
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
stand
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
whether
you
had
not
better
remain
in
the
carriage
with
her
,
while
I
go
in
and
break
it
to
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
this
is
a
good
plan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
:
<EOS>
he
was
satisfied
,
and
said
no
more
.
<EOS>
But
the
remembrance
of
the
appeal
remained
a
pleasure
to
her
,
as
a
proof
of
friendship
,
and
of
deference
for
her
judgement
,
a
great
pleasure
;
and
when
it
became
a
sort
of
parting
proof
,
its
value
did
not
lessen
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
distressing
communication
at
Uppercross
was
over
,
and
he
had
seen
the
father
and
mother
quite
as
composed
as
could
be
hoped
,
and
the
daughter
all
the
better
for
being
with
them
,
he
announced
his
intention
of
returning
in
the
same
carriage
to
Lyme
;
and
when
the
horses
were
baited
,
he
was
off
.
  
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
The
remainder
of
Anne
's
time
at
Uppercross
,
comprehending
only
two
days
,
was
spent
entirely
at
the
Mansion
House
;
and
she
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
herself
extremely
useful
there
,
both
as
an
immediate
companion
,
and
as
assisting
in
all
those
arrangements
for
the
future
,
which
,
in
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
distressed
state
of
spirits
,
would
have
been
difficulties
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
an
early
account
from
Lyme
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
Louisa
was
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
No
symptoms
worse
than
before
had
appeared
.
<EOS>
Charles
came
a
few
hours
afterwards
,
to
bring
a
later
and
more
particular
account
.
<EOS>
He
was
tolerably
cheerful
.
<EOS>
A
speedy
cure
must
not
be
hoped
,
but
everything
was
going
on
as
well
as
the
nature
of
the
case
admitted
.
<EOS>
In
speaking
of
the
Harvilles
,
he
seemed
unable
to
satisfy
his
own
sense
of
their
kindness
,
especially
of
Mrs
Harville
's
exertions
as
a
nurse
.
"
<EOS>
She
really
left
nothing
for
Mary
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
and
Mary
had
been
persuaded
to
go
early
to
their
inn
last
night
.
<EOS>
Mary
had
been
hysterical
again
this
morning
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
away
,
she
was
going
to
walk
out
with
Captain
Benwick
,
which
,
he
hoped
,
would
do
her
good
.
<EOS>
He
almost
wished
she
had
been
prevailed
on
to
come
home
the
day
before
;
but
the
truth
was
,
that
Mrs
Harville
left
nothing
for
anybody
to
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
was
to
return
to
Lyme
the
same
afternoon
,
and
his
father
had
at
first
half
a
mind
to
go
with
him
,
but
the
ladies
could
not
consent
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
going
only
to
multiply
trouble
to
the
others
,
and
increase
his
own
distress
;
and
a
much
better
scheme
followed
and
was
acted
upon
.
<EOS>
A
chaise
was
sent
for
from
Crewkherne
,
and
Charles
conveyed
back
a
far
more
useful
person
in
the
old
nursery
-
maid
of
the
family
,
one
who
having
brought
up
all
the
children
,
and
seen
the
very
last
,
the
lingering
and
long
-
petted
Master
Harry
,
sent
to
school
after
his
brothers
,
was
now
living
in
her
deserted
nursery
to
mend
stockings
and
dress
all
the
blains
and
bruises
she
could
get
near
her
,
and
who
,
consequently
,
was
only
too
happy
in
being
allowed
to
go
and
help
nurse
dear
Miss
Louisa
.
<EOS>
Vague
wishes
of
getting
Sarah
thither
,
had
occurred
before
to
Mrs
Musgrove
and
Henrietta
;
but
without
Anne
,
it
would
hardly
have
been
resolved
on
,
and
found
practicable
so
soon
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
indebted
,
the
next
day
,
to
Charles
Hayter
,
for
all
the
minute
knowledge
of
Louisa
,
which
it
was
so
essential
to
obtain
every
twenty
-
four
hours
.
<EOS>
He
made
it
his
business
to
go
to
Lyme
,
and
his
account
was
still
encouraging
.
<EOS>
The
intervals
of
sense
and
consciousness
were
believed
to
be
stronger
.
<EOS>
Every
report
agreed
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
appearing
fixed
in
Lyme
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
to
leave
them
on
the
morrow
,
an
event
which
they
all
dreaded
.
<EOS>
"
What
should
they
do
without
her
?
<EOS>
They
were
wretched
comforters
for
one
another
.
"
<EOS>
And
so
much
was
said
in
this
way
,
that
Anne
thought
she
could
not
do
better
than
impart
among
them
the
general
inclination
to
which
she
was
privy
,
and
persuaded
them
all
to
go
to
Lyme
at
once
.
<EOS>
She
had
little
difficulty
;
it
was
soon
determined
that
they
would
go
;
go
to
-
morrow
,
fix
themselves
at
the
inn
,
or
get
into
lodgings
,
as
it
suited
,
and
there
remain
till
dear
Louisa
could
be
moved
.
<EOS>
They
must
be
taking
off
some
trouble
from
the
good
people
she
was
with
;
they
might
at
least
relieve
Mrs
Harville
from
the
care
of
her
own
children
;
and
in
short
,
they
were
so
happy
in
the
decision
,
that
Anne
was
delighted
with
what
she
had
done
,
and
felt
that
she
could
not
spend
her
last
morning
at
Uppercross
better
than
in
assisting
their
preparations
,
and
sending
them
off
at
an
early
hour
,
though
her
being
left
to
the
solitary
range
of
the
house
was
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
the
last
,
excepting
the
little
boys
at
the
cottage
<EOS>
,
she
was
the
very
last
,
the
only
remaining
one
of
all
that
had
filled
and
animated
both
houses
,
of
all
that
had
given
Uppercross
its
cheerful
character
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
had
made
a
change
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
If
Louisa
recovered
,
it
would
all
be
well
again
.
<EOS>
More
than
former
happiness
would
be
restored
.
<EOS>
There
could
not
be
a
doubt
,
to
her
mind
there
was
none
,
of
what
would
follow
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
A
few
months
hence
,
and
the
room
now
so
deserted
,
occupied
but
by
her
silent
,
pensive
self
,
might
be
filled
again
with
all
that
was
happy
and
gay
,
all
that
was
glowing
and
bright
in
prosperous
love
,
all
that
was
most
unlike
Anne
Elliot
!
  
<EOS>
An
hour
's
complete
leisure
for
such
reflections
as
these
,
on
a
dark
November
day
,
a
small
thick
rain
almost
blotting
out
the
very
few
objects
ever
to
be
discerned
from
the
windows
,
was
enough
to
make
the
sound
of
Lady
Russell
's
carriage
exceedingly
welcome
;
and
yet
,
though
desirous
to
be
gone
,
she
could
not
quit
the
Mansion
House
,
or
look
an
adieu
to
the
Cottage
,
with
its
black
,
dripping
and
comfortless
veranda
,
or
even
notice
through
the
misty
glasses
the
last
humble
tenements
of
the
village
,
without
a
saddened
heart
.
<EOS>
Scenes
had
passed
in
Uppercross
which
made
it
precious
.
<EOS>
It
stood
the
record
of
many
sensations
of
pain
,
once
severe
,
but
now
softened
;
and
of
some
instances
of
relenting
feeling
,
some
breathings
of
friendship
and
reconciliation
,
which
could
never
be
looked
for
again
,
and
which
could
never
cease
to
be
dear
.
<EOS>
She
left
it
all
behind
her
,
all
but
the
recollection
that
such
things
had
been
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
never
entered
Kellynch
since
her
quitting
Lady
Russell
's
house
in
September
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
been
necessary
,
and
the
few
occasions
of
its
being
possible
for
her
to
go
to
the
Hall
she
had
contrived
to
evade
and
escape
from
.
<EOS>
Her
first
return
was
to
resume
her
place
in
the
modern
and
elegant
apartments
of
the
Lodge
,
and
to
gladden
the
eyes
of
its
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
some
anxiety
mixed
with
Lady
Russell
's
joy
in
meeting
her
.
<EOS>
She
knew
who
had
been
frequenting
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
But
happily
,
either
Anne
was
improved
in
plumpness
and
looks
,
or
Lady
Russell
fancied
her
so
;
and
Anne
,
in
receiving
her
compliments
on
the
occasion
,
had
the
amusement
of
connecting
them
with
the
silent
admiration
of
her
cousin
,
and
of
hoping
that
she
was
to
be
blessed
with
a
second
spring
of
youth
and
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
converse
,
she
was
soon
sensible
of
some
mental
change
.
<EOS>
The
subjects
of
which
her
heart
had
been
full
on
leaving
Kellynch
,
and
which
she
had
felt
slighted
,
and
been
compelled
to
smother
among
the
Musgroves
,
were
now
become
but
of
secondary
interest
.
<EOS>
She
had
lately
lost
sight
even
of
her
father
and
sister
and
Bath
.
<EOS>
Their
concerns
had
been
sunk
under
those
of
Uppercross
;
and
when
Lady
Russell
reverted
to
their
former
hopes
and
fears
,
and
spoke
her
satisfaction
in
the
house
in
Camden
Place
,
which
had
been
taken
,
and
her
regret
that
Mrs
Clay
should
still
be
with
them
,
Anne
would
have
been
ashamed
to
have
it
known
how
much
more
she
was
thinking
of
Lyme
and
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
all
her
acquaintance
there
;
how
much
more
interesting
to
her
was
the
home
and
the
friendship
of
the
Harvilles
and
Captain
Benwick
,
than
her
own
father
's
house
in
Camden
Place
,
or
her
own
sister
's
intimacy
with
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
She
was
actually
forced
to
exert
herself
to
meet
Lady
Russell
with
anything
like
the
appearance
of
equal
solicitude
,
on
topics
which
had
by
nature
the
first
claim
on
her
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
awkwardness
at
first
in
their
discourse
on
another
subject
.
<EOS>
They
must
speak
of
the
accident
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
had
not
been
arrived
five
minutes
the
day
before
,
when
a
full
account
of
the
whole
had
burst
on
her
;
but
still
it
must
be
talked
of
<EOS>
,
she
must
make
enquiries
,
she
must
regret
the
imprudence
,
lament
the
result
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
's
name
must
be
mentioned
by
both
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
conscious
of
not
doing
it
so
well
as
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
speak
the
name
,
and
look
straight
forward
to
Lady
Russell
's
eye
,
till
she
had
adopted
the
expedient
of
telling
her
briefly
what
she
thought
of
the
attachment
between
him
and
Louisa
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
told
,
his
name
distressed
her
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
had
only
to
listen
composedly
,
and
wish
them
happy
,
but
internally
her
heart
revelled
in
angry
pleasure
,
in
pleased
contempt
,
that
the
man
who
at
twenty
-
three
had
seemed
to
understand
somewhat
of
the
value
of
an
Anne
Elliot
,
should
,
eight
years
afterwards
,
be
charmed
by
a
Louisa
Musgrove
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
three
or
four
days
passed
most
quietly
,
with
no
circumstance
to
mark
them
excepting
the
receipt
of
a
note
or
two
from
Lyme
,
which
found
their
way
to
Anne
,
she
could
not
tell
how
,
and
brought
a
rather
improving
account
of
Louisa
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
period
,
Lady
Russell
's
politeness
could
repose
no
longer
,
and
the
fainter
self
-
threatenings
of
the
past
became
in
a
decided
tone
,
"
I
must
call
on
Mrs
Croft
;
I
really
must
call
upon
her
soon
.
<EOS>
Anne
,
have
you
courage
to
go
with
me
,
and
pay
a
visit
in
that
house
?
<EOS>
It
will
be
some
trial
to
us
both
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
did
not
shrink
from
it
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
truly
felt
as
she
said
,
in
observing
    
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
are
very
likely
to
suffer
the
most
of
the
two
;
your
feelings
are
less
reconciled
to
the
change
than
mine
.
<EOS>
By
remaining
in
the
neighbourhood
,
I
am
become
inured
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
have
said
more
on
the
subject
;
for
she
had
in
fact
<EOS>
so
high
an
opinion
of
the
Crofts
,
and
considered
her
father
so
very
fortunate
in
his
tenants
,
felt
the
parish
to
be
so
sure
of
a
good
example
,
and
the
poor
of
the
best
attention
and
relief
,
that
however
sorry
and
ashamed
for
the
necessity
of
the
removal
,
she
could
not
but
in
conscience
feel
that
they
were
gone
who
deserved
not
to
stay
,
and
that
Kellynch
Hall
had
passed
into
better
hands
than
its
owners
'
.
<EOS>
These
convictions
must
unquestionably
have
their
own
pain
,
and
severe
was
its
kind
;
but
they
precluded
that
pain
which
Lady
Russell
would
suffer
in
entering
the
house
again
,
and
returning
through
the
well
-
known
apartments
.
  
<EOS>
In
such
moments
Anne
had
no
power
of
saying
to
herself
,
"
These
rooms
ought
to
belong
only
to
us
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
fallen
in
their
destination
!
<EOS>
How
unworthily
occupied
!
<EOS>
An
ancient
family
to
be
so
driven
away
!
<EOS>
Strangers
filling
their
place
!
"
<EOS>
No
,
except
when
she
thought
of
her
mother
,
and
remembered
where
she
had
been
used
to
sit
and
preside
,
she
had
no
sigh
of
that
description
to
heave
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
always
met
her
with
a
kindness
which
gave
her
the
pleasure
of
fancying
herself
a
favourite
,
and
on
the
present
occasion
,
receiving
her
in
that
house
,
there
was
particular
attention
.
  
<EOS>
The
sad
accident
at
Lyme
was
soon
the
prevailing
topic
,
and
on
comparing
their
latest
accounts
of
the
invalid
,
it
appeared
that
each
lady
dated
her
intelligence
from
the
same
hour
of
yestermorn
;
that
Captain
Wentworth
had
been
in
Kellynch
yesterday
(
the
first
time
since
the
accident
)
,
had
brought
Anne
the
last
note
,
which
she
had
not
been
able
to
trace
the
exact
steps
of
;
had
staid
a
few
hours
and
then
returned
again
to
Lyme
,
and
without
any
present
intention
of
quitting
it
any
more
.
<EOS>
He
had
enquired
after
her
,
she
found
,
particularly
;
had
expressed
his
hope
of
Miss
Elliot
<EOS>
's
not
being
the
worse
for
her
exertions
,
and
had
spoken
of
those
exertions
as
great
.
<EOS>
This
was
handsome
,
and
gave
her
more
pleasure
than
almost
anything
else
could
have
done
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
sad
catastrophe
itself
,
it
could
be
canvassed
only
in
one
style
by
a
couple
of
steady
,
sensible
women
,
whose
judgements
had
to
work
on
ascertained
events
;
and
it
was
perfectly
decided
that
it
had
been
the
consequence
of
much
thoughtlessness
and
much
imprudence
;
that
its
effects
were
most
alarming
,
and
that
it
was
frightful
to
think
,
how
long
Miss
Musgrove
's
recovery
might
yet
be
doubtful
,
and
how
liable
she
would
still
remain
to
suffer
from
the
concussion
hereafter
!
<EOS>
The
Admiral
wound
it
up
summarily
by
exclaiming
    
"
Ay
,
a
very
bad
business
indeed
.
<EOS>
A
new
sort
of
way
this
,
for
a
young
fellow
to
be
making
love
,
by
breaking
his
mistress
's
head
,
is
not
it
,
Miss
Elliot
?
<EOS>
This
is
breaking
a
head
and
giving
a
plaster
,
truly
!
"
  
<EOS>
Admiral
Croft
's
manners
were
not
quite
of
the
tone
to
suit
Lady
Russell
,
but
they
delighted
Anne
.
<EOS>
His
goodness
of
heart
and
simplicity
of
character
were
irresistible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
this
must
be
very
bad
for
you
,
"
said
he
,
suddenly
rousing
from
a
little
reverie
,
"
to
be
coming
and
finding
us
here
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
recollected
it
before
,
I
declare
,
but
it
must
be
very
bad
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
do
not
stand
upon
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Get
up
and
go
over
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
if
you
like
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Another
time
,
Sir
,
I
thank
you
,
not
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
whenever
it
suits
you
.
<EOS>
You
can
slip
in
from
the
shrubbery
at
any
time
;
and
there
you
will
find
we
keep
our
umbrellas
hanging
up
by
that
door
.
<EOS>
A
good
place
is
not
it
?
<EOS>
But
,
"
(
checking
himself
)
,
"
you
will
not
think
it
a
good
place
,
for
yours
were
always
kept
in
the
butler
's
room
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
so
it
always
is
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
One
man
's
ways
may
be
as
good
as
another
's
,
but
we
all
like
our
own
best
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
must
judge
for
yourself
,
whether
it
would
be
better
for
you
to
go
about
the
house
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
finding
she
might
decline
it
,
did
so
,
very
gratefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
made
very
few
changes
either
,
"
continued
the
Admiral
,
after
thinking
a
moment
.
"
<EOS>
Very
few
.
<EOS>
We
told
you
about
the
laundry
-
door
,
at
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
That
has
been
a
very
great
improvement
.
<EOS>
The
wonder
was
,
how
any
family
upon
earth
could
bear
with
the
inconvenience
of
its
opening
as
it
did
,
so
long
!
<EOS>
You
will
tell
Sir
Walter
what
we
have
done
,
and
that
Mr
Shepherd
thinks
it
the
greatest
improvement
the
house
ever
had
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
must
do
ourselves
the
justice
to
say
,
that
the
few
alterations
we
have
made
have
been
all
very
much
for
the
better
.
<EOS>
My
wife
should
have
the
credit
of
them
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
very
little
besides
sending
away
some
of
the
large
looking
-
glasses
from
my
dressing
-
room
,
which
was
your
father
's
.
<EOS>
A
very
good
man
,
and
very
much
the
gentleman
<EOS>
I
am
sure
:
<EOS>
but
I
should
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
"
(
looking
with
serious
reflection
)
<EOS>
,
"
I
should
think
he
must
be
rather
a
dressy
man
for
his
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
Such
a
number
of
looking
-
glasses
!
<EOS>
oh
Lord
!
<EOS>
there
was
no
getting
away
from
one
's
self
.
<EOS>
So
I
got
Sophy
to
lend
me
a
hand
,
and
we
soon
shifted
their
quarters
;
and
now
I
am
quite
snug
,
with
my
little
shaving
glass
in
one
corner
,
and
another
great
thing
that
I
never
go
near
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
amused
in
spite
of
herself
,
was
rather
distressed
for
an
answer
,
and
the
Admiral
,
fearing
he
might
not
have
been
civil
enough
,
took
up
the
subject
again
,
to
say
    
"
The
next
time
you
write
to
your
good
father
,
Miss
Elliot
,
pray
give
him
my
compliments
and
Mrs
Croft
's
,
and
say
that
we
are
settled
here
quite
to
our
liking
,
and
have
no
fault
at
all
to
find
with
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast
-
room
chimney
smokes
a
little
,
I
grant
you
,
but
it
is
only
when
the
wind
is
due
north
and
blows
hard
,
which
may
not
happen
three
times
a
winter
.
<EOS>
And
take
it
altogether
,
now
that
we
have
been
into
most
of
the
houses
hereabouts
and
can
judge
,
there
is
not
one
that
we
like
better
than
this
.
<EOS>
Pray
say
so
,
with
my
compliments
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
glad
to
hear
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
and
Mrs
Croft
were
very
well
pleased
with
each
other
:
but
the
acquaintance
which
this
visit
began
was
fated
not
to
proceed
far
at
present
;
for
when
it
was
returned
,
the
Crofts
announced
themselves
to
be
going
away
for
a
few
weeks
,
to
visit
their
connexions
in
the
north
of
the
county
,
and
probably
might
not
be
at
home
again
before
Lady
Russell
would
be
removing
to
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
So
ended
all
danger
to
Anne
of
meeting
Captain
Wentworth
at
Kellynch
Hall
,
or
of
seeing
him
in
company
with
her
friend
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
safe
enough
,
and
she
smiled
over
the
many
anxious
feelings
she
had
wasted
on
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
Though
Charles
and
Mary
had
remained
at
Lyme
much
longer
after
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
going
than
Anne
conceived
<EOS>
they
could
have
been
at
all
wanted
,
they
were
yet
the
first
of
the
family
to
be
at
home
again
;
and
as
soon
as
possible
after
their
return
to
Uppercross
they
drove
over
to
the
Lodge
.
<EOS>
They
had
left
Louisa
beginning
to
sit
up
;
but
her
head
,
though
clear
,
was
exceedingly
weak
,
and
her
nerves
susceptible
to
the
highest
extreme
of
tenderness
;
and
though
she
might
be
pronounced
to
be
altogether
doing
very
well
,
it
was
still
impossible
to
say
when
she
might
be
able
to
bear
the
removal
home
;
and
her
father
and
mother
,
who
must
return
in
time
to
receive
their
younger
children
for
the
Christmas
holidays
,
had
hardly
a
hope
of
being
allowed
to
bring
her
with
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
been
all
in
lodgings
together
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
had
got
Mrs
Harville
's
children
away
as
much
as
she
could
,
every
possible
supply
from
Uppercross
had
been
furnished
,
to
lighten
the
inconvenience
to
the
Harvilles
,
while
the
Harvilles
had
been
wanting
them
to
come
to
dinner
every
day
;
and
in
short
,
it
seemed
to
have
been
only
a
struggle
on
each
side
as
to
which
should
be
most
disinterested
and
hospitable
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
had
her
evils
;
but
upon
the
whole
,
as
was
evident
by
her
staying
so
long
,
she
had
found
more
to
enjoy
than
to
suffer
.
<EOS>
Charles
Hayter
had
been
at
Lyme
oftener
than
suited
her
;
and
when
they
dined
with
the
Harvilles
there
had
been
only
a
maid
-
servant
to
wait
,
and
at
first
Mrs
Harville
had
always
given
Mrs
Musgrove
precedence
;
but
then
,
she
had
received
so
very
handsome
an
apology
from
her
on
finding
out
whose
daughter
she
was
,
and
there
had
been
so
much
going
on
every
day
,
there
had
been
so
many
walks
between
their
lodgings
and
the
Harvilles
,
and
she
had
got
books
from
the
library
,
and
changed
them
so
often
,
that
the
balance
had
certainly
been
much
in
favour
of
Lyme
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
taken
to
Charmouth
too
,
and
she
had
bathed
,
and
she
had
gone
to
church
,
and
there
were
a
great
many
more
people
to
look
at
in
the
church
at
Lyme
than
at
Uppercross
;
and
all
this
,
joined
to
the
sense
of
being
so
very
useful
,
had
made
really
an
agreeable
fortnight
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
enquired
after
Captain
Benwick
,
Mary
's
face
was
clouded
directly
.
<EOS>
Charles
laughed
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
is
very
well
,
I
believe
,
but
he
is
a
very
odd
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
know
what
he
would
be
at
.
<EOS>
We
asked
him
to
come
home
with
us
for
a
day
or
two
:
<EOS>
Charles
undertook
to
give
him
some
shooting
,
and
he
seemed
quite
delighted
,
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
thought
it
was
all
settled
;
when
behold
!
<EOS>
on
Tuesday
night
,
he
made
a
very
awkward
sort
of
excuse
;
"
he
never
shot
'
and
he
had
"
been
quite
misunderstood
,
"
and
he
had
promised
this
<EOS>
and
he
had
promised
that
,
and
<EOS>
the
end
of
it
was
,
I
found
,
that
he
did
not
mean
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
was
afraid
of
finding
it
dull
;
but
upon
my
word
I
should
have
thought
we
were
lively
enough
at
the
Cottage
for
such
a
heart
-
broken
man
as
Captain
Benwick
.
"
  
<EOS>
Charles
laughed
again
and
said
,
"
Now
Mary
,
you
know
very
well
how
it
really
was
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
your
doing
,
"
(
turning
to
Anne
.
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
fancied
that
if
he
went
with
us
,
he
should
find
you
close
by
:
he
fancied
everybody
to
be
living
in
Uppercross
;
and
when
he
discovered
that
Lady
Russell
lived
three
miles
off
,
his
heart
failed
him
,
and
he
had
not
courage
to
come
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
fact
,
upon
my
honour
,
Mary
knows
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mary
did
not
give
into
it
very
graciously
,
whether
from
not
considering
Captain
Benwick
entitled
by
birth
and
situation
to
be
in
love
with
an
Elliot
,
or
from
not
wanting
to
believe
Anne
a
greater
attraction
to
Uppercross
than
herself
,
must
be
left
to
be
guessed
.
<EOS>
Anne
's
good
-
will
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
lessened
by
what
she
heard
.
<EOS>
She
boldly
acknowledged
herself
flattered
,
and
continued
her
enquiries
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
talks
of
you
,
"
cried
Charles
,
"
in
such
terms
 
<EOS>
"
Mary
interrupted
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
Charles
,
I
never
heard
him
mention
Anne
twice
all
the
time
I
was
there
.
<EOS>
I
declare
,
Anne
,
he
never
talks
of
you
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
admitted
Charles
,
"
I
do
not
know
that
he
ever
does
,
in
a
general
way
;
but
however
,
it
is
a
very
clear
thing
that
he
admires
you
exceedingly
.
<EOS>
His
head
is
full
of
some
books
that
he
is
reading
upon
your
recommendation
,
and
he
wants
to
talk
to
you
about
them
;
he
has
found
out
something
or
other
in
one
of
them
which
he
thinks
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
I
can
not
pretend
to
remember
it
,
but
it
was
something
very
fine
 
<EOS>
I
overheard
him
telling
Henrietta
all
about
it
;
and
then
"
Miss
Elliot
'
was
spoken
of
in
the
highest
terms
!
<EOS>
Now
Mary
,
I
declare
it
was
so
<EOS>
,
I
heard
it
myself
,
and
you
were
in
the
other
room
.
<EOS>
"
Elegance
,
sweetness
,
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
there
was
no
end
of
Miss
Elliot
's
charms
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
I
am
sure
,
"
cried
Mary
,
warmly
,
"
it
was
a
very
little
to
his
credit
,
if
he
did
.
<EOS>
Miss
Harville
only
died
last
June
.
<EOS>
Such
a
heart
is
very
little
worth
having
;
is
it
,
Lady
Russell
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
Captain
Benwick
before
I
decide
,
"
said
Lady
Russell
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
you
are
very
likely
to
do
very
soon
,
I
can
tell
you
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
Though
he
had
not
nerves
for
coming
away
with
us
,
and
setting
off
again
afterwards
to
pay
a
formal
visit
here
,
he
will
make
his
way
over
to
Kellynch
one
day
by
himself
,
you
may
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
the
distance
and
the
road
,
and
I
told
him
of
the
church
's
being
so
very
well
worth
seeing
;
for
as
he
has
a
taste
for
those
sort
of
things
<EOS>
,
I
thought
that
would
be
a
good
excuse
,
and
he
listened
with
all
his
understanding
and
soul
;
and
I
am
sure
from
his
manner
that
you
will
have
him
calling
here
soon
.
<EOS>
So
,
I
give
you
notice
,
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
acquaintance
of
Anne
's
will
always
be
welcome
to
me
,
"
was
Lady
Russell
's
kind
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
as
to
being
Anne
's
acquaintance
,
"
said
Mary
,
"
I
think
he
is
rather
my
acquaintance
,
for
I
have
been
seeing
him
every
day
this
last
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
as
your
joint
acquaintance
,
then
,
I
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
find
anything
very
agreeable
in
him
,
I
assure
you
,
ma'am
.
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
the
dullest
young
men
that
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
He
has
walked
with
me
,
sometimes
,
from
one
end
of
the
sands
to
the
other
,
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
at
all
a
well
-
bred
young
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
not
like
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
we
differ
,
Mary
,
"
said
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
Lady
Russell
would
like
him
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
would
be
so
much
pleased
with
his
mind
,
that
she
would
very
soon
see
no
deficiency
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
So
do
I
,
Anne
,
"
said
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
Lady
Russell
would
like
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
just
Lady
Russell
's
sort
.
<EOS>
Give
him
a
book
,
and
he
will
read
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
he
will
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mary
,
tauntingly
.
"
<EOS>
He
will
sit
poring
over
his
book
,
and
not
know
when
a
person
speaks
to
him
,
or
when
one
drop
's
one
's
scissors
,
or
anything
that
happens
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Lady
Russell
would
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
could
not
help
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
said
she
,
"
I
should
not
have
supposed
that
my
opinion
of
any
one
could
have
admitted
of
such
difference
of
conjecture
,
steady
and
matter
of
fact
as
I
may
call
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
really
a
curiosity
to
see
the
person
who
can
give
occasion
to
such
directly
opposite
notions
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
may
be
induced
to
call
here
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
does
,
Mary
,
you
may
depend
upon
hearing
my
opinion
;
but
I
am
determined
not
to
judge
him
beforehand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
like
him
,
I
will
answer
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
began
talking
of
something
else
.
<EOS>
Mary
spoke
with
animation
of
their
meeting
with
,
or
rather
missing
,
Mr
Elliot
so
extraordinarily
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
man
,
"
said
Lady
Russell
,
"
whom
I
have
no
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
His
declining
to
be
on
cordial
terms
with
the
head
of
his
family
,
has
left
a
very
strong
impression
in
his
disfavour
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
decision
checked
Mary
's
eagerness
,
and
stopped
her
short
in
the
midst
of
the
Elliot
countenance
.
  
<EOS>
With
regard
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
though
Anne
hazarded
no
enquiries
,
there
was
voluntary
communication
sufficient
.
<EOS>
His
spirits
had
been
greatly
recovering
lately
as
might
be
expected
.
<EOS>
As
Louisa
improved
,
he
had
improved
,
and
he
was
now
quite
a
different
creature
from
what
he
had
been
the
first
week
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
seen
Louisa
;
and
was
so
extremely
fearful
of
any
ill
consequence
to
her
from
an
interview
,
that
he
did
not
press
for
it
at
all
;
and
,
on
the
contrary
,
seemed
to
have
a
plan
of
going
away
for
a
week
or
ten
days
,
till
her
head
was
stronger
.
<EOS>
He
had
talked
of
going
down
to
Plymouth
for
a
week
,
and
wanted
to
persuade
Captain
Benwick
to
go
with
him
;
but
,
as
Charles
maintained
to
the
last
,
Captain
Benwick
seemed
much
more
disposed
to
ride
over
to
Kellynch
.
  
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
Lady
Russell
and
Anne
were
both
occasionally
thinking
of
Captain
Benwick
,
from
this
time
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
could
not
hear
the
door
-
bell
without
feeling
that
it
might
be
his
herald
;
nor
could
Anne
return
from
any
stroll
of
solitary
indulgence
in
her
father
's
grounds
,
or
any
visit
of
charity
in
the
village
,
without
wondering
whether
she
might
see
him
or
hear
of
him
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
came
not
,
however
.
<EOS>
He
was
either
less
disposed
for
it
than
Charles
had
imagined
,
or
he
was
too
shy
;
and
after
giving
him
a
week
's
indulgence
,
Lady
Russell
determined
him
to
be
unworthy
of
the
interest
which
he
had
been
beginning
to
excite
.
  
<EOS>
The
Musgroves
came
back
to
receive
their
happy
boys
and
girls
from
school
,
bringing
with
them
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
's
little
children
,
to
improve
the
noise
of
Uppercross
,
and
lessen
that
of
Lyme
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
remained
with
Louisa
;
but
all
the
rest
of
the
family
were
again
in
their
usual
quarters
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
and
Anne
paid
their
compliments
to
them
once
,
when
Anne
could
not
but
feel
that
Uppercross
was
already
quite
alive
again
.
<EOS>
Though
neither
Henrietta
,
nor
Louisa
,
nor
Charles
Hayter
,
nor
Captain
Wentworth
were
there
,
the
room
presented
as
strong
a
contrast
as
could
be
wished
to
the
last
state
she
had
seen
it
in
.
  
<EOS>
Immediately
surrounding
Mrs
Musgrove
were
the
little
Harvilles
,
whom
she
was
sedulously
guarding
from
the
tyranny
of
the
two
children
from
the
Cottage
,
expressly
arrived
to
amuse
them
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
was
a
table
occupied
by
some
chattering
girls
,
cutting
up
silk
and
gold
paper
;
and
on
the
other
were
tressels
and
trays
,
bending
under
the
weight
of
brawn
and
cold
pies
,
where
riotous
boys
were
holding
high
revel
;
the
whole
completed
by
a
roaring
Christmas
fire
,
which
seemed
determined
to
be
heard
,
in
spite
of
all
the
noise
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
Charles
and
Mary
also
came
in
,
of
course
,
during
their
visit
,
and
Mr
Musgrove
made
a
point
of
paying
his
respects
to
Lady
Russell
,
and
sat
down
close
to
her
for
ten
minutes
,
talking
with
a
very
raised
voice
,
but
from
the
clamour
of
the
children
on
his
knees
,
generally
in
vain
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fine
family
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
judging
from
her
own
temperament
,
would
have
deemed
such
a
domestic
hurricane
a
bad
restorative
of
the
nerves
,
which
Louisa
's
illness
must
have
so
greatly
shaken
.
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Musgrove
,
who
got
Anne
near
her
on
purpose
to
thank
her
most
cordially
,
again
and
again
,
for
all
her
attentions
to
them
,
concluded
a
short
recapitulation
of
what
she
had
suffered
herself
by
observing
,
with
a
happy
glance
round
the
room
,
that
after
all
she
had
gone
through
,
nothing
was
so
likely
to
do
her
good
as
a
little
quiet
cheerfulness
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
Louisa
was
now
recovering
apace
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
could
even
think
of
her
being
able
to
join
their
party
at
home
,
before
her
brothers
and
sisters
went
to
school
again
.
<EOS>
The
Harvilles
had
promised
to
come
with
her
and
stay
at
Uppercross
,
whenever
she
returned
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
was
gone
,
for
the
present
,
to
see
his
brother
in
Shropshire
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
shall
remember
,
in
future
,
"
said
Lady
Russell
,
as
soon
as
they
were
reseated
in
the
carriage
,
"
not
to
call
at
Uppercross
in
the
Christmas
holidays
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Everybody
has
their
taste
in
noises
as
well
as
in
other
matters
;
and
sounds
are
quite
innoxious
,
or
most
distressing
,
by
their
sort
rather
than
their
quantity
.
<EOS>
When
Lady
Russell
not
long
afterwards
,
was
entering
Bath
on
a
wet
afternoon
,
and
driving
through
the
long
course
of
streets
from
the
Old
Bridge
to
Camden
Place
,
amidst
the
dash
of
other
carriages
,
the
heavy
rumble
of
carts
and
drays
,
the
bawling
of
newspapermen
,
muffin
-
men
and
milkmen
,
and
the
ceaseless
clink
of
pattens
,
she
made
no
complaint
.
<EOS>
No
,
these
were
noises
which
belonged
to
the
winter
pleasures
;
her
spirits
rose
under
their
influence
;
and
like
Mrs
Musgrove
,
she
was
feeling
,
though
not
saying
,
that
after
being
long
in
the
country
,
nothing
could
be
so
good
for
her
as
a
little
quiet
cheerfulness
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
did
not
share
these
feelings
.
<EOS>
She
persisted
in
a
very
determined
,
though
very
silent
disinclination
for
Bath
;
caught
the
first
dim
view
of
the
extensive
buildings
,
smoking
in
rain
,
without
any
wish
of
seeing
them
better
;
felt
their
progress
through
the
streets
to
be
,
however
disagreeable
,
yet
too
rapid
;
for
who
would
be
glad
to
see
her
when
she
arrived
?
<EOS>
And
looked
back
,
with
fond
regret
,
to
the
bustles
of
Uppercross
and
the
seclusion
of
Kellynch
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
's
last
letter
had
communicated
a
piece
of
news
of
some
interest
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
He
had
called
in
Camden
Place
;
had
called
a
second
time
,
a
third
;
had
been
pointedly
attentive
.
<EOS>
If
Elizabeth
and
her
father
did
not
deceive
themselves
,
had
been
taking
much
pains
to
seek
the
acquaintance
,
and
proclaim
the
value
of
the
connection
,
as
he
had
formerly
taken
pains
to
shew
neglect
.
<EOS>
This
was
very
wonderful
if
it
were
true
;
and
Lady
Russell
was
in
a
state
of
very
agreeable
curiosity
and
perplexity
about
Mr
Elliot
,
already
recanting
the
sentiment
she
had
so
lately
expressed
to
Mary
,
of
his
being
"
a
man
whom
she
had
no
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
a
great
wish
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
really
sought
to
reconcile
himself
like
a
dutiful
branch
,
he
must
be
forgiven
for
having
dismembered
himself
from
the
paternal
tree
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
not
animated
to
an
equal
pitch
by
the
circumstance
,
but
she
felt
that
she
would
rather
see
Mr
Elliot
again
than
not
,
which
was
more
than
she
could
say
for
many
other
persons
in
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
put
down
in
Camden
Place
;
and
Lady
Russell
then
drove
to
her
own
lodgings
,
in
Rivers
Street
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
had
taken
a
very
good
house
in
Camden
Place
,
a
lofty
dignified
situation
,
such
as
becomes
a
man
of
consequence
;
and
both
he
and
Elizabeth
were
settled
there
,
much
to
their
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
entered
it
with
a
sinking
heart
,
anticipating
an
imprisonment
of
many
months
,
and
anxiously
saying
to
herself
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
when
shall
I
leave
you
again
?
"
<EOS>
A
degree
of
unexpected
cordiality
,
however
,
in
the
welcome
she
received
,
did
her
good
.
<EOS>
Her
father
and
sister
were
glad
to
see
her
,
for
the
sake
of
shewing
her
the
house
and
furniture
,
and
met
her
with
kindness
.
<EOS>
Her
making
a
fourth
,
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
,
was
noticed
as
an
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
was
very
pleasant
,
and
very
smiling
,
but
her
courtesies
and
smiles
were
more
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
always
felt
that
she
would
pretend
what
was
proper
on
her
arrival
,
but
the
complaisance
of
the
others
was
unlooked
for
.
<EOS>
They
were
evidently
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
she
was
soon
to
listen
to
the
causes
.
<EOS>
They
had
no
inclination
to
listen
to
her
.
<EOS>
After
laying
out
for
some
compliments
of
being
deeply
regretted
in
their
old
neighbourhood
,
which
Anne
could
not
pay
,
they
had
only
a
few
faint
enquiries
to
make
,
before
the
talk
must
be
all
their
own
.
<EOS>
Uppercross
excited
no
interest
,
Kellynch
very
little
:
it
was
all
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
the
pleasure
of
assuring
her
that
Bath
more
than
answered
their
expectations
in
every
respect
.
<EOS>
Their
house
was
undoubtedly
the
best
in
Camden
Place
;
their
drawing
-
rooms
had
many
decided
advantages
over
all
the
others
which
they
had
either
seen
or
heard
of
,
and
the
superiority
was
not
less
in
the
style
of
the
fitting
-
up
,
or
the
taste
of
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
Their
acquaintance
was
exceedingly
sought
after
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
wanting
to
visit
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
drawn
back
from
many
introductions
,
and
still
were
perpetually
having
cards
left
by
people
of
whom
they
knew
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Here
were
funds
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Could
Anne
wonder
that
her
father
and
sister
were
happy
?
<EOS>
She
might
not
wonder
,
but
she
must
sigh
that
her
father
should
feel
no
degradation
in
his
change
,
should
see
nothing
to
regret
in
the
duties
and
dignity
of
the
resident
landholder
,
should
find
so
much
to
be
vain
of
in
the
littlenesses
of
a
town
;
and
she
must
sigh
,
and
smile
,
and
wonder
too
,
as
Elizabeth
threw
open
the
folding
-
doors
and
walked
with
exultation
from
one
drawing
-
room
to
the
other
,
boasting
of
their
space
;
at
the
possibility
of
that
woman
,
who
had
been
mistress
of
Kellynch
Hall
,
finding
extent
to
be
proud
of
between
two
walls
,
perhaps
thirty
feet
asunder
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
all
which
they
had
to
make
them
happy
.
<EOS>
They
had
Mr
Elliot
too
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
a
great
deal
to
hear
of
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
only
pardoned
,
they
were
delighted
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
Bath
about
a
fortnight
;
(
he
had
passed
through
Bath
in
November
,
in
his
way
to
London
,
when
the
intelligence
of
Sir
Walter
's
being
settled
there
had
of
course
reached
him
,
though
only
twenty
-
four
hours
in
the
place
,
but
he
had
not
been
able
to
avail
himself
of
it
;
)
but
he
had
now
been
a
fortnight
in
Bath
,
and
his
first
object
on
arriving
,
had
been
to
leave
his
card
in
Camden
Place
,
following
it
up
by
such
assiduous
endeavours
to
meet
,
and
when
they
did
meet
,
by
such
great
openness
of
conduct
,
such
readiness
to
apologize
for
the
past
,
such
solicitude
to
be
received
as
a
relation
again
,
that
their
former
good
understanding
was
completely
re
-
established
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
not
a
fault
to
find
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
explained
away
all
the
appearance
of
neglect
on
his
own
side
.
<EOS>
It
had
originated
in
misapprehension
entirely
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
had
an
idea
of
throwing
himself
off
;
he
had
feared
that
he
was
thrown
off
,
but
knew
not
why
,
and
delicacy
had
kept
him
silent
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
hint
of
having
spoken
disrespectfully
or
carelessly
of
the
family
and
the
family
honours
,
he
was
quite
indignant
.
<EOS>
He
,
who
had
ever
boasted
of
being
an
Elliot
,
and
whose
feelings
,
as
to
connection
,
were
only
too
strict
to
suit
the
unfeudal
tone
of
the
present
day
.
<EOS>
He
was
astonished
,
indeed
,
but
his
character
and
general
conduct
must
refute
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
refer
Sir
Walter
to
all
who
knew
him
;
and
certainly
,
the
pains
he
had
been
taking
on
this
,
the
first
opportunity
of
reconciliation
,
to
be
restored
to
the
footing
of
a
relation
and
heir
-
presumptive
,
was
a
strong
proof
of
his
opinions
on
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
of
his
marriage
,
too
,
were
found
to
admit
of
much
extenuation
.
<EOS>
This
was
an
article
not
to
be
entered
on
by
himself
;
but
a
very
intimate
friend
of
his
,
a
Colonel
Wallis
,
a
highly
respectable
man
,
perfectly
the
gentleman
,
(
and
not
an
ill
-
looking
man
,
Sir
Walter
added
)
,
who
was
living
in
very
good
style
in
Marlborough
Buildings
,
and
had
,
at
his
own
particular
request
,
been
admitted
to
their
acquaintance
through
Mr
Elliot
,
<EOS>
had
mentioned
one
or
two
things
relative
to
the
marriage
,
which
made
a
material
difference
in
the
discredit
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
had
known
Mr
Elliot
long
,
had
been
well
acquainted
also
with
his
wife
,
had
perfectly
understood
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
She
was
certainly
not
a
woman
of
family
,
but
well
educated
,
accomplished
,
rich
,
and
excessively
in
love
with
his
friend
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
the
charm
.
<EOS>
She
had
sought
him
.
<EOS>
Without
that
attraction
,
not
all
her
money
would
have
tempted
Elliot
,
and
Sir
Walter
was
,
moreover
,
assured
of
her
having
been
a
very
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
great
deal
to
soften
the
business
.
<EOS>
A
very
fine
woman
with
a
large
fortune
,
in
love
with
him
!
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
seemed
to
admit
it
as
complete
apology
;
and
though
Elizabeth
could
not
see
the
circumstance
in
quite
so
favourable
a
light
,
she
allowed
it
be
a
great
extenuation
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
had
called
repeatedly
,
had
dined
with
them
once
,
evidently
delighted
by
the
distinction
of
being
asked
,
for
they
gave
no
dinners
in
general
;
delighted
,
in
short
,
by
every
proof
of
cousinly
notice
,
and
placing
his
whole
happiness
in
being
on
intimate
terms
in
Camden
Place
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
listened
,
but
without
quite
understanding
it
.
<EOS>
Allowances
,
large
allowances
,
she
knew
,
must
be
made
for
the
ideas
of
those
who
spoke
.
<EOS>
She
heard
it
all
under
embellishment
.
<EOS>
All
that
sounded
extravagant
or
irrational
in
the
progress
of
the
reconciliation
might
have
no
origin
but
in
the
language
of
the
relators
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
she
had
the
sensation
of
there
being
something
more
than
immediately
appeared
,
in
Mr
Elliot
's
wishing
,
after
an
interval
of
so
many
years
,
to
be
well
received
by
them
.
<EOS>
In
a
worldly
view
,
he
had
nothing
to
gain
by
being
on
terms
with
Sir
Walter
;
nothing
to
risk
by
a
state
of
variance
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
he
was
already
the
richer
of
the
two
,
and
the
Kellynch
estate
would
as
surely
be
his
hereafter
as
the
title
.
<EOS>
A
sensible
man
,
and
he
had
looked
like
a
very
sensible
man
,
why
should
it
be
an
object
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
could
only
offer
one
solution
;
it
was
,
perhaps
,
for
Elizabeth
's
sake
.
<EOS>
There
might
really
have
been
a
liking
formerly
,
though
convenience
and
accident
had
drawn
him
a
different
way
;
and
now
that
he
could
afford
to
please
himself
,
he
might
mean
to
pay
his
addresses
to
her
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
was
certainly
very
handsome
,
with
well
-
bred
,
elegant
manners
,
and
her
character
might
never
have
been
penetrated
by
Mr
Elliot
,
knowing
her
but
in
public
,
and
when
very
young
himself
.
<EOS>
How
her
temper
and
understanding
might
bear
the
investigation
of
his
present
keener
time
of
life
was
another
concern
and
rather
a
fearful
one
.
<EOS>
Most
earnestly
did
she
wish
that
he
might
not
be
too
nice
,
or
too
observant
if
Elizabeth
were
his
object
;
and
that
Elizabeth
was
disposed
to
believe
herself
so
,
and
that
her
friend
Mrs
Clay
was
encouraging
the
idea
,
seemed
apparent
by
a
glance
or
two
between
them
,
while
Mr
Elliot
's
frequent
visits
were
talked
of
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
mentioned
the
glimpses
she
had
had
of
him
at
Lyme
,
but
without
being
much
attended
to
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
perhaps
,
it
had
been
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
know
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
him
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
They
could
not
listen
to
her
description
of
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
describing
him
themselves
;
Sir
Walter
especially
.
<EOS>
He
did
justice
to
his
very
gentlemanlike
appearance
,
his
air
of
elegance
and
fashion
,
his
good
shaped
face
,
his
sensible
eye
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
"
must
lament
his
being
very
much
under
-
hung
,
a
defect
which
time
seemed
to
have
increased
;
nor
could
he
pretend
to
say
that
ten
years
had
not
altered
almost
every
feature
for
the
worse
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
appeared
to
think
that
he
(
Sir
Walter
)
was
looking
exactly
as
he
had
done
when
they
last
parted
;
"
but
Sir
Walter
had
"
not
been
able
to
return
the
compliment
entirely
,
which
had
embarrassed
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
mean
to
complain
,
however
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
better
to
look
at
than
most
men
,
and
he
had
no
objection
to
being
seen
with
him
anywhere
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
,
and
his
friends
in
Marlborough
Buildings
,
were
talked
of
the
whole
evening
.
"
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
had
been
so
impatient
to
be
introduced
to
them
!
<EOS>
and
Mr
Elliot
so
anxious
that
he
should
!
"
<EOS>
and
there
was
a
Mrs
Wallis
,
at
present
known
only
to
them
by
description
,
as
she
was
in
daily
expectation
of
her
confinement
;
but
Mr
Elliot
spoke
of
her
as
"
a
most
charming
woman
,
quite
worthy
of
being
known
in
Camden
Place
,
"
and
as
soon
as
she
recovered
they
were
to
be
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
thought
much
of
Mrs
Wallis
;
she
was
said
to
be
an
excessively
pretty
woman
,
beautiful
.
"
<EOS>
He
longed
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
He
hoped
she
might
make
some
amends
for
the
many
very
plain
faces
he
was
continually
passing
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
The
worst
of
Bath
was
the
number
of
its
plain
women
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
mean
to
say
that
there
were
no
pretty
women
,
but
the
number
of
the
plain
was
out
of
all
proportion
.
<EOS>
He
had
frequently
observed
,
as
he
walked
,
that
one
handsome
face
would
be
followed
by
thirty
,
or
five
-
and
-
thirty
frights
;
and
once
,
as
he
had
stood
in
a
shop
on
Bond
Street
,
he
had
counted
<EOS>
eighty
-
seven
women
go
by
,
one
after
another
,
without
there
being
a
tolerable
face
among
them
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
frosty
morning
,
to
be
sure
,
a
sharp
frost
,
which
hardly
one
woman
in
a
thousand
could
stand
the
test
of
.
<EOS>
But
still
,
there
certainly
were
a
dreadful
multitude
of
ugly
women
in
Bath
;
and
as
for
the
men
!
<EOS>
they
were
infinitely
worse
.
<EOS>
Such
scarecrows
as
the
streets
were
full
of
!
<EOS>
It
was
evident
how
little
the
women
were
used
to
the
sight
of
anything
tolerable
,
by
the
effect
which
a
man
of
decent
appearance
produced
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
walked
anywhere
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Colonel
Wallis
(
who
was
a
fine
military
figure
,
though
sandy
-
haired
)
without
observing
that
every
woman
's
eye
was
upon
him
;
every
woman
's
eye
was
sure
to
be
upon
Colonel
Wallis
.
"
<EOS>
Modest
Sir
Walter
!
<EOS>
He
was
not
allowed
to
escape
,
however
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
and
Mrs
Clay
united
in
hinting
that
Colonel
Wallis
's
companion
might
have
as
good
a
figure
as
Colonel
Wallis
,
and
certainly
was
not
sandy
-
haired
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mary
looking
?
"
said
Sir
Walter
,
in
the
height
of
his
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
I
saw
her
she
had
a
red
nose
,
but
I
hope
that
may
not
happen
every
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
no
,
that
must
have
been
quite
accidental
.
<EOS>
In
general
she
has
been
in
very
good
health
and
very
good
looks
since
Michaelmas
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
it
would
not
tempt
her
to
go
out
in
sharp
winds
,
and
grow
coarse
,
I
would
send
her
a
new
hat
and
pelisse
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
considering
whether
she
should
venture
to
suggest
that
a
gown
,
or
a
cap
,
would
not
be
liable
to
any
such
misuse
,
when
a
knock
at
the
door
suspended
everything
.
"
<EOS>
A
knock
at
the
door
!
<EOS>
and
so
late
!
<EOS>
It
was
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
Mr
Elliot
?
<EOS>
They
knew
he
was
to
dine
in
Lansdown
Crescent
.
<EOS>
It
was
possible
that
he
might
stop
in
his
way
home
to
ask
them
how
they
did
.
<EOS>
They
could
think
of
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
decidedly
thought
it
Mr
Elliot
's
knock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
was
right
.
<EOS>
With
all
the
state
which
a
butler
and
foot
-
boy
could
give
,
Mr
Elliot
was
ushered
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
,
the
very
same
man
,
with
no
difference
but
of
dress
.
<EOS>
Anne
drew
a
little
back
,
while
the
others
received
his
compliments
,
and
her
sister
his
apologies
for
calling
at
so
unusual
an
hour
,
but
"
he
could
not
be
so
near
without
wishing
to
know
that
neither
she
nor
her
friend
had
taken
cold
the
day
before
,
"
&
c.
&
c
;
which
was
all
as
politely
done
,
and
as
politely
taken
,
as
possible
,
but
her
part
must
follow
then
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
talked
of
his
youngest
daughter
;
"
Mr
Elliot
must
give
him
leave
to
present
him
to
his
youngest
daughter
"
<EOS>
(
there
was
no
occasion
for
remembering
Mary
)
;
and
Anne
,
smiling
and
blushing
,
very
becomingly
shewed
to
Mr
Elliot
the
pretty
features
which
he
had
by
no
means
forgotten
,
and
instantly
saw
,
with
amusement
at
his
little
start
of
surprise
,
that
he
had
not
been
at
all
aware
of
who
she
was
.
<EOS>
He
looked
completely
astonished
,
but
not
more
astonished
than
pleased
;
his
eyes
brightened
!
<EOS>
and
with
the
most
perfect
alacrity
he
welcomed
the
relationship
,
alluded
to
the
past
,
and
entreated
to
be
received
as
an
acquaintance
already
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
as
good
-
looking
as
he
had
appeared
at
Lyme
,
his
countenance
improved
by
speaking
,
and
his
manners
were
so
exactly
what
they
ought
to
be
,
so
polished
,
so
easy
,
so
particularly
agreeable
,
that
she
could
compare
them
in
excellence
to
only
one
person
's
manners
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
the
same
,
but
they
were
,
perhaps
,
equally
good
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
with
them
,
and
improved
their
conversation
very
much
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
his
being
a
sensible
man
.
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
were
enough
to
certify
that
.
<EOS>
His
tone
,
his
expressions
,
his
choice
of
subject
,
his
knowing
where
to
stop
;
it
was
all
the
operation
of
a
sensible
,
discerning
mind
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
,
he
began
to
talk
to
her
of
Lyme
,
wanting
to
compare
opinions
respecting
the
place
,
but
especially
wanting
to
speak
of
the
circumstance
of
their
happening
to
be
guests
in
the
same
inn
at
the
same
time
;
to
give
his
own
route
,
understand
something
of
hers
,
and
regret
that
he
should
have
lost
such
an
opportunity
of
paying
his
respects
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
a
short
account
of
her
party
and
business
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
His
regret
increased
as
he
listened
.
<EOS>
He
had
spent
his
whole
solitary
evening
in
the
room
adjoining
theirs
;
had
heard
voices
,
mirth
continually
;
thought
they
must
be
a
most
delightful
set
of
people
,
longed
to
be
with
them
,
but
certainly
without
the
smallest
suspicion
of
his
possessing
the
shadow
of
a
right
to
introduce
himself
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
but
asked
who
the
party
were
!
<EOS>
The
name
of
Musgrove
would
have
told
him
enough
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
it
would
serve
to
cure
him
of
an
absurd
practice
of
never
asking
a
question
at
an
inn
,
which
he
had
adopted
,
when
quite
a
young
man
,
on
the
principal
of
its
being
very
ungenteel
to
be
curious
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
notions
of
a
young
man
of
one
or
two
and
twenty
,
"
said
he
,
"
<EOS>
as
to
what
is
necessary
in
manners
to
make
him
quite
the
thing
,
are
more
absurd
,
I
believe
,
than
those
of
any
other
set
of
beings
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
folly
of
the
means
they
often
employ
is
only
to
be
equalled
by
the
folly
of
what
they
have
in
view
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
he
must
not
be
addressing
his
reflections
to
Anne
alone
<EOS>
:
he
knew
it
;
he
was
soon
diffused
again
among
the
others
,
and
it
was
only
at
intervals
that
he
could
return
to
Lyme
.
  
<EOS>
His
enquiries
,
however
,
produced
at
length
an
account
of
the
scene
she
had
been
engaged
in
there
,
soon
after
his
leaving
the
place
.
<EOS>
Having
alluded
to
"
an
accident
,
"
he
must
hear
the
whole
.
<EOS>
When
he
questioned
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
began
to
question
also
,
but
the
difference
in
their
manner
of
doing
it
could
not
be
unfelt
.
<EOS>
She
could
only
compare
Mr
Elliot
to
Lady
Russell
,
in
the
wish
of
really
comprehending
what
had
passed
,
and
in
the
degree
of
concern
for
what
she
must
have
suffered
in
witnessing
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
staid
an
hour
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
elegant
little
clock
on
the
mantel
-
piece
had
struck
"
eleven
with
its
silver
sounds
,
"
and
the
watchman
was
beginning
to
be
heard
at
a
distance
telling
the
same
tale
,
before
Mr
Elliot
or
any
of
them
seemed
to
feel
that
he
had
been
there
long
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
have
supposed
it
possible
that
her
first
evening
in
Camden
Place
could
have
passed
so
well
!
    
<EOS>
There
was
one
point
which
Anne
,
on
returning
to
her
family
,
would
have
been
more
thankful
to
ascertain
even
than
Mr
Elliot
's
being
in
love
with
Elizabeth
,
which
was
,
her
father
's
not
being
in
love
with
Mrs
Clay
;
and
she
was
very
far
from
easy
about
it
,
when
she
had
been
at
home
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
On
going
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
,
she
found
there
had
just
been
a
decent
pretence
on
the
lady
's
side
of
meaning
to
leave
them
.
<EOS>
She
could
imagine
Mrs
Clay
to
have
said
,
that
"
now
Miss
Anne
was
come
,
she
could
not
suppose
herself
at
all
wanted
;
"
for
Elizabeth
was
replying
in
a
sort
of
whisper
,
"
That
must
not
be
any
reason
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
feel
it
none
.
<EOS>
She
is
nothing
to
me
,
compared
with
you
;
"
and
she
was
in
full
time
to
hear
her
father
say
,
"
My
dear
madam
,
this
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
As
yet
,
you
have
seen
nothing
of
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
here
only
to
be
useful
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
run
away
from
us
now
.
<EOS>
You
must
stay
to
be
acquainted
with
Mrs
Wallis
,
the
beautiful
Mrs
Wallis
.
<EOS>
To
your
fine
mind
,
I
well
know
the
sight
of
beauty
is
a
real
gratification
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
and
looked
so
much
in
earnest
,
that
Anne
was
not
surprised
to
see
Mrs
Clay
stealing
a
glance
at
Elizabeth
and
herself
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
,
perhaps
,
might
express
some
watchfulness
;
but
the
praise
of
the
fine
mind
did
not
appear
to
excite
a
thought
in
her
sister
.
<EOS>
The
lady
could
not
but
yield
to
such
joint
entreaties
,
and
promise
to
stay
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
same
morning
,
Anne
and
her
father
chancing
to
be
alone
together
,
he
began
to
compliment
her
on
her
improved
looks
;
he
thought
her
"
less
thin
in
her
person
,
in
her
cheeks
;
her
skin
,
her
complexion
,
greatly
improved
;
clearer
,
fresher
.
<EOS>
Had
she
been
using
any
thing
in
particular
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
.
"
<EOS>
"
Merely
Gowland
,
"
he
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
nothing
at
all
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
he
was
surprised
at
that
;
"
and
added
,
"
certainly
you
can
not
do
better
than
to
continue
as
you
are
;
you
can
not
be
better
than
well
;
or
I
should
recommend
Gowland
,
the
constant
use
of
Gowland
,
during
the
spring
months
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
has
been
using
it
at
my
recommendation
,
and
you
see
what
it
has
done
for
her
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
it
has
carried
away
her
freckles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
Elizabeth
could
but
have
heard
this
!
<EOS>
Such
personal
praise
might
have
struck
her
,
especially
as
it
did
not
appear
to
Anne
that
the
freckles
were
at
all
lessened
.
<EOS>
But
everything
must
take
its
chance
.
<EOS>
The
evil
of
a
marriage
would
be
much
diminished
,
if
Elizabeth
were
also
to
marry
.
<EOS>
As
for
herself
,
she
might
always
command
a
home
with
Lady
Russell
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
's
composed
mind
and
polite
manners
were
put
to
some
trial
on
this
point
,
in
her
intercourse
in
Camden
Place
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
Mrs
Clay
in
such
favour
,
and
of
Anne
so
overlooked
,
was
a
perpetual
provocation
to
her
there
;
and
vexed
her
as
much
when
she
was
away
,
as
a
person
in
Bath
who
drinks
the
water
,
gets
all
the
new
publications
,
and
has
a
very
large
acquaintance
,
has
time
to
be
vexed
.
  
<EOS>
As
Mr
Elliot
became
known
to
her
,
she
grew
more
charitable
,
or
more
indifferent
,
towards
the
others
.
<EOS>
His
manners
were
an
immediate
recommendation
;
and
on
conversing
with
him
she
found
the
solid
so
fully
supporting
the
superficial
,
that
she
was
at
first
,
as
she
told
Anne
,
almost
ready
to
exclaim
,
"
Can
this
be
Mr
Elliot
?
"
and
could
not
seriously
picture
to
herself
a
more
agreeable
or
estimable
man
.
<EOS>
Everything
united
in
him
;
good
understanding
,
correct
opinions
,
knowledge
of
the
world
,
and
a
warm
heart
.
<EOS>
He
had
strong
feelings
of
family
attachment
and
family
honour
,
without
pride
or
weakness
;
he
lived
with
the
liberality
of
a
man
of
fortune
,
without
display
;
he
judged
for
himself
in
everything
essential
,
without
defying
public
opinion
in
any
point
of
worldly
decorum
.
<EOS>
He
was
steady
,
observant
,
moderate
,
candid
;
never
run
away
with
by
spirits
or
by
selfishness
,
which
fancied
itself
strong
feeling
;
and
yet
,
with
a
sensibility
to
what
was
amiable
and
lovely
,
and
a
value
for
all
the
felicities
of
domestic
life
,
which
characters
of
fancied
enthusiasm
and
violent
agitation
seldom
really
possess
.
<EOS>
She
was
sure
that
he
had
not
been
happy
in
marriage
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
said
it
,
and
Lady
Russell
saw
it
;
but
it
had
been
no
unhappiness
to
sour
his
mind
,
nor
(
she
began
pretty
soon
to
suspect
)
to
prevent
his
thinking
of
a
second
choice
.
<EOS>
Her
satisfaction
in
Mr
Elliot
outweighed
all
the
plague
of
Mrs
Clay
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
some
years
since
Anne
had
begun
to
learn
that
she
and
her
excellent
friend
could
sometimes
think
differently
;
and
it
did
not
surprise
her
,
therefore
,
that
Lady
Russell
should
see
nothing
suspicious
or
inconsistent
,
nothing
to
require
more
motives
than
appeared
,
in
Mr
Elliot
's
great
desire
of
a
reconciliation
.
<EOS>
In
Lady
Russell
's
view
,
it
was
perfectly
natural
that
Mr
Elliot
,
at
a
mature
time
of
life
,
should
feel
it
a
most
desirable
object
,
and
what
would
very
generally
recommend
him
among
all
sensible
people
,
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
head
of
his
family
;
the
simplest
process
in
the
world
of
time
upon
a
head
naturally
clear
,
and
only
erring
in
the
heyday
of
youth
.
<EOS>
Anne
presumed
,
however
,
still
to
smile
about
it
,
and
at
last
to
mention
"
Elizabeth
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
listened
,
and
looked
,
and
made
only
this
cautious
reply
:
 
"
Elizabeth
!
<EOS>
very
well
;
time
will
explain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
reference
to
the
future
,
which
Anne
,
after
a
little
observation
,
felt
she
must
submit
to
.
<EOS>
She
could
determine
nothing
at
present
.
<EOS>
In
that
house
Elizabeth
must
be
first
;
and
she
was
in
the
habit
of
such
general
observance
as
"
Miss
Elliot
,
"
that
any
particularity
of
attention
seemed
almost
impossible
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
,
too
,
it
must
be
remembered
,
had
not
been
a
widower
seven
months
.
<EOS>
A
little
delay
on
his
side
might
be
very
excusable
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
Anne
could
never
see
the
crape
round
his
hat
,
without
fearing
that
she
was
the
inexcusable
one
,
in
attributing
to
him
such
imaginations
;
for
though
his
marriage
had
not
been
very
happy
,
still
it
had
existed
so
many
years
that
she
could
not
comprehend
a
very
rapid
recovery
from
the
awful
impression
of
its
being
dissolved
.
  
<EOS>
However
it
might
end
,
he
was
without
any
question
their
pleasantest
acquaintance
in
Bath
:
she
saw
nobody
equal
to
him
;
and
it
was
a
great
indulgence
now
and
then
to
talk
to
him
about
Lyme
,
which
he
seemed
to
have
as
lively
a
wish
to
see
again
,
and
to
see
more
of
,
as
herself
.
<EOS>
They
went
through
the
particulars
of
their
first
meeting
a
great
many
times
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
had
looked
at
her
with
some
earnestness
.
<EOS>
She
knew
it
well
;
and
she
remembered
another
person
's
look
also
.
  
<EOS>
They
did
not
always
think
alike
.
<EOS>
His
value
for
rank
and
connexion
she
perceived
was
greater
than
hers
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
merely
complaisance
,
it
must
be
a
liking
to
the
cause
,
which
made
him
enter
warmly
into
her
father
and
sister
's
solicitudes
on
a
subject
which
she
thought
unworthy
to
excite
them
.
<EOS>
The
Bath
paper
one
morning
announced
the
arrival
of
the
Dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
,
and
her
daughter
,
the
Honourable
Miss
Carteret
;
and
all
the
comfort
of
No
.
,
Camden
Place
,
was
swept
away
for
many
days
;
for
the
Dalrymples
(
in
Anne
's
opinion
,
most
unfortunately
)
were
cousins
of
the
Elliots
;
and
the
agony
was
how
to
introduce
themselves
properly
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
never
seen
her
father
and
sister
before
in
contact
with
nobility
,
and
she
must
acknowledge
herself
disappointed
.
<EOS>
She
had
hoped
better
things
from
their
high
ideas
of
their
own
situation
in
life
,
and
was
reduced
to
form
a
wish
which
she
had
never
foreseen
;
a
wish
that
they
had
more
pride
;
for
"
our
cousins
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
;
"
"
our
cousins
,
the
Dalrymples
,
"
sounded
in
her
ears
all
day
long
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
had
once
been
in
company
with
the
late
viscount
,
but
had
never
seen
any
of
the
rest
of
the
family
;
and
the
difficulties
of
the
case
arose
from
there
having
been
a
suspension
of
all
intercourse
by
letters
of
ceremony
,
<EOS>
ever
since
the
death
of
that
said
late
viscount
,
when
,
in
consequence
of
a
dangerous
illness
of
Sir
Walter
's
at
the
same
time
,
there
had
been
an
unlucky
omission
at
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
No
letter
of
condolence
had
been
sent
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
The
neglect
had
been
visited
on
the
head
of
the
sinner
;
for
when
poor
Lady
Elliot
died
herself
,
no
letter
of
condolence
was
received
at
Kellynch
,
and
,
consequently
,
there
was
but
too
much
reason
to
apprehend
that
the
Dalrymples
considered
the
relationship
as
closed
.
<EOS>
How
to
have
this
anxious
business
set
to
rights
,
and
be
admitted
as
cousins
again
,
was
the
question
:
and
it
was
a
question
which
,
in
a
more
rational
manner
,
neither
Lady
Russell
nor
Mr
Elliot
thought
unimportant
.
"
<EOS>
Family
connexions
were
always
worth
preserving
,
good
company
always
worth
seeking
;
Lady
Dalrymple
had
taken
a
house
,
for
three
months
,
in
Laura
Place
,
and
would
be
living
in
style
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
at
Bath
the
year
before
,
and
Lady
Russell
had
heard
her
spoken
of
as
a
charming
woman
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
desirable
that
the
connexion
should
be
renewed
,
if
it
could
be
done
,
without
any
compromise
of
propriety
on
the
side
of
the
Elliots
.
"
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
however
,
would
choose
his
own
means
,
and
at
last
wrote
a
very
fine
letter
of
ample
explanation
,
regret
,
and
entreaty
,
to
his
right
honourable
cousin
.
<EOS>
Neither
Lady
Russell
nor
Mr
Elliot
could
admire
the
letter
;
but
it
did
all
that
was
wanted
,
in
bringing
three
lines
of
scrawl
from
the
Dowager
Viscountess
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
very
much
honoured
,
and
should
be
happy
in
their
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
The
toils
of
the
business
were
over
,
the
sweets
began
.
<EOS>
They
visited
in
Laura
Place
,
they
had
the
cards
of
Dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
,
and
the
Honourable
Miss
Carteret
,
to
be
arranged
wherever
they
might
be
most
visible
:
and
"
Our
cousins
in
Laura
Place
,
"
 
"
Our
cousin
,
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
,
"
were
talked
of
to
everybody
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
ashamed
.
<EOS>
Had
Lady
Dalrymple
and
her
daughter
even
been
very
agreeable
,
she
would
still
have
been
ashamed
of
the
agitation
they
created
,
but
they
were
nothing
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
superiority
of
manner
,
accomplishment
,
or
understanding
.
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
had
acquired
the
name
of
"
a
charming
woman
,
"
because
she
had
a
smile
and
a
civil
answer
for
everybody
.
<EOS>
Miss
Carteret
,
with
still
less
to
say
,
was
so
plain
and
<EOS>
so
awkward
,
that
she
would
never
have
been
tolerated
in
Camden
Place
but
for
her
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
confessed
she
had
expected
something
better
;
but
yet
"
it
was
an
acquaintance
worth
having
;
"
and
when
Anne
ventured
to
speak
her
opinion
of
them
to
Mr
Elliot
,
he
agreed
to
their
being
nothing
in
themselves
,
but
still
maintained
that
,
as
a
family
connexion
,
as
good
company
,
as
those
who
would
collect
good
company
around
them
,
they
had
their
value
.
<EOS>
Anne
smiled
and
said
,
  
"
My
idea
of
good
company
,
Mr
Elliot
,
is
the
company
of
clever
,
well
-
informed
people
,
who
have
a
great
deal
of
conversation
;
that
is
what
I
call
good
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
"
said
he
gently
,
"
that
is
not
good
company
;
that
is
the
best
.
<EOS>
Good
company
requires
only
birth
,
education
,
and
manners
,
and
with
regard
to
education
is
not
very
nice
.
<EOS>
Birth
and
good
manners
are
essential
;
but
a
little
learning
is
by
no
means
a
dangerous
thing
in
good
company
;
on
the
contrary
,
it
will
do
very
well
.
<EOS>
My
cousin
Anne
shakes
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
is
fastidious
.
<EOS>
My
dear
cousin
"
(
sitting
down
by
her
)
,
"
you
have
a
better
right
to
be
fastidious
than
almost
any
other
woman
I
know
;
but
will
it
answer
?
<EOS>
Will
it
make
you
happy
?
<EOS>
Will
it
not
be
wiser
to
accept
the
society
of
those
good
ladies
in
Laura
Place
,
and
enjoy
all
the
advantages
of
the
connexion
as
far
as
possible
?
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
it
,
that
they
will
move
in
the
first
set
in
Bath
this
winter
,
and
as
rank
is
rank
,
your
being
known
to
be
related
to
them
will
have
its
use
in
fixing
your
family
<EOS>
(
our
family
let
me
say
)
in
that
degree
of
consideration
which
we
must
all
wish
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
sighed
Anne
,
"
we
shall
,
indeed
,
be
known
to
be
related
to
them
!
"
<EOS>
then
recollecting
herself
,
and
not
wishing
to
be
answered
,
she
added
,
"
I
certainly
do
think
there
has
been
by
far
too
much
trouble
taken
to
procure
the
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
"
(
smiling
)
"
I
have
more
pride
than
any
of
you
;
but
I
confess
it
does
vex
me
,
that
we
should
be
so
solicitous
to
have
the
relationship
acknowledged
,
which
we
may
be
very
sure
<EOS>
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
dear
cousin
<EOS>
,
you
are
unjust
in
your
own
claims
.
<EOS>
In
London
,
perhaps
,
in
your
present
quiet
style
of
living
,
it
might
be
as
you
say
:
but
in
Bath
;
Sir
Walter
Elliot
and
his
family
will
always
be
worth
knowing
:
always
acceptable
as
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
I
certainly
am
proud
,
too
proud
to
enjoy
a
welcome
which
depends
so
entirely
upon
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
your
indignation
,
"
said
he
;
"
it
is
very
natural
.
<EOS>
But
here
you
are
in
Bath
,
and
the
object
is
to
be
established
here
with
all
the
credit
and
dignity
which
ought
to
belong
to
Sir
Walter
Elliot
.
<EOS>
You
talk
of
being
proud
;
I
am
called
proud
,
I
know
,
and
I
shall
not
wish
to
believe
myself
otherwise
;
for
our
pride
,
if
investigated
,
would
have
the
same
object
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
though
the
kind
may
seem
a
little
different
.
<EOS>
In
one
point
,
I
am
sure
,
my
dear
cousin
,
"
(
he
continued
,
speaking
lower
,
though
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
)
<EOS>
"
in
one
point
,
I
am
sure
,
we
must
feel
alike
.
<EOS>
We
must
feel
that
every
addition
to
your
father
's
society
,
among
his
equals
or
superiors
,
may
be
of
use
in
diverting
his
thoughts
from
those
who
are
beneath
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
seat
which
Mrs
Clay
had
been
lately
occupying
:
a
sufficient
explanation
of
what
he
particularly
meant
;
and
though
Anne
could
not
believe
in
their
having
the
same
sort
of
pride
,
she
was
pleased
with
him
for
not
liking
Mrs
Clay
;
and
her
conscience
admitted
that
his
wishing
to
promote
her
father
's
getting
great
acquaintance
was
more
than
excusable
in
the
view
of
defeating
her
.
    
<EOS>
While
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
assiduously
pushing
their
good
fortune
in
Laura
Place
,
Anne
was
renewing
an
acquaintance
of
a
very
different
description
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
called
on
her
former
governess
,
and
had
heard
from
her
of
there
being
an
old
school
-
fellow
in
Bath
,
who
had
the
two
strong
claims
on
her
attention
of
past
kindness
and
present
suffering
.
<EOS>
Miss
Hamilton
,
now
Mrs
Smith
,
had
shewn
her
kindness
in
one
of
those
periods
of
her
life
when
it
had
been
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
gone
unhappy
to
school
,
grieving
for
the
loss
of
a
mother
whom
she
had
dearly
loved
,
feeling
her
separation
from
home
,
and
suffering
as
a
girl
of
fourteen
,
of
strong
sensibility
and
not
high
spirits
,
must
suffer
at
such
a
time
;
and
Miss
Hamilton
,
three
years
older
than
herself
,
but
still
from
the
want
of
near
relations
and
a
settled
home
,
remaining
another
year
at
school
,
had
been
useful
and
good
to
her
in
a
way
which
had
considerably
lessened
her
misery
,
and
could
never
be
remembered
with
indifference
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Hamilton
had
left
school
,
had
married
not
long
afterwards
,
was
said
to
have
married
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
this
was
all
that
Anne
had
known
of
her
,
till
now
that
their
governess
's
account
brought
her
situation
forward
in
a
more
decided
but
very
different
form
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
widow
and
poor
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
had
been
extravagant
;
and
at
his
death
,
about
two
years
before
,
had
left
his
affairs
dreadfully
involved
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
difficulties
of
every
sort
to
contend
with
,
and
in
addition
to
these
distresses
had
been
afflicted
with
a
severe
rheumatic
fever
,
which
,
finally
settling
in
her
legs
,
had
made
her
for
the
present
a
cripple
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
to
Bath
on
that
account
,
and
was
now
in
lodgings
near
the
hot
baths
,
living
in
a
very
humble
way
,
unable
even
to
afford
herself
the
comfort
of
a
servant
,
and
of
course
almost
excluded
from
society
.
  
<EOS>
Their
mutual
friend
answered
for
the
satisfaction
which
a
visit
from
Miss
Elliot
would
give
Mrs
Smith
,
and
Anne
therefore
lost
no
time
in
going
.
<EOS>
She
mentioned
nothing
of
what
she
had
heard
,
or
what
she
intended
,
at
home
.
<EOS>
It
would
excite
no
proper
interest
there
.
<EOS>
She
only
consulted
Lady
Russell
,
who
entered
thoroughly
into
her
sentiments
,
and
was
most
happy
to
convey
her
as
near
to
Mrs
Smith
's
lodgings
in
Westgate
Buildings
,
as
Anne
chose
to
be
taken
.
  
<EOS>
The
visit
was
paid
,
their
acquaintance
re
-
established
,
their
interest
in
each
other
more
than
re
-
kindled
.
<EOS>
The
first
ten
minutes
had
its
awkwardness
and
its
emotion
.
<EOS>
Twelve
years
were
gone
since
they
had
parted
,
and
each
presented
a
somewhat
different
person
from
what
the
other
had
imagined
.
<EOS>
Twelve
years
had
changed
Anne
from
the
blooming
,
silent
,
unformed
girl
of
fifteen
,
to
the
elegant
little
woman
of
seven
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
every
beauty
except
bloom
,
and
with
manners
as
consciously
right
as
they
were
invariably
gentle
;
and
twelve
years
had
transformed
the
fine
-
looking
,
well
-
grown
Miss
Hamilton
,
in
all
the
glow
of
health
and
confidence
of
superiority
,
into
a
poor
,
infirm
,
helpless
widow
,
receiving
the
visit
of
her
former
protegee
as
a
favour
;
but
all
that
was
uncomfortable
in
the
meeting
had
soon
passed
away
,
and
left
only
the
interesting
charm
of
remembering
former
partialities
and
talking
over
old
times
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
found
in
Mrs
Smith
the
good
sense
and
agreeable
manners
which
she
had
almost
ventured
to
depend
on
,
and
a
disposition
to
converse
and
be
cheerful
beyond
her
expectation
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
dissipations
of
the
past
 
and
she
had
lived
very
much
in
the
world
 
nor
the
restrictions
of
the
present
,
neither
sickness
nor
sorrow
seemed
to
have
closed
her
heart
or
ruined
her
spirits
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
second
visit
she
talked
with
great
openness
,
and
Anne
's
astonishment
increased
.
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
imagine
a
more
cheerless
situation
in
itself
than
Mrs
Smith
's
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
very
fond
of
her
husband
:
she
had
buried
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
used
to
affluence
:
it
was
gone
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
child
to
connect
her
with
life
and
happiness
again
,
no
relations
to
assist
in
the
arrangement
of
perplexed
affairs
,
no
health
to
make
all
the
rest
supportable
.
<EOS>
Her
accommodations
were
limited
to
a
noisy
parlour
,
and
a
dark
bedroom
behind
,
with
no
possibility
of
moving
from
one
to
the
other
without
assistance
,
which
there
was
only
one
servant
in
the
house
to
afford
,
and
she
never
quitted
the
house
but
to
be
conveyed
into
the
warm
bath
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
Anne
had
reason
to
believe
that
she
had
moments
only
of
languor
and
depression
,
to
hours
of
occupation
and
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
How
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
She
watched
,
observed
,
reflected
,
and
finally
determined
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
fortitude
or
of
resignation
only
.
<EOS>
A
submissive
spirit
might
be
patient
,
a
strong
understanding
would
supply
resolution
,
but
here
was
something
more
;
here
was
that
elasticity
of
mind
,
that
disposition
to
be
comforted
,
that
power
of
turning
readily
from
evil
to
good
,
and
of
finding
employment
which
carried
her
out
of
herself
,
which
was
from
nature
alone
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
choicest
gift
of
Heaven
;
and
Anne
viewed
her
friend
as
one
of
those
instances
in
which
,
by
a
merciful
appointment
,
it
seems
designed
to
counterbalance
almost
every
other
want
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
time
,
Mrs
Smith
told
her
,
when
her
spirits
had
nearly
failed
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
call
herself
an
invalid
now
,
compared
with
her
state
on
first
reaching
Bath
.
<EOS>
Then
she
had
,
indeed
,
been
a
pitiable
object
;
for
she
had
caught
cold
on
the
journey
,
and
had
hardly
taken
possession
of
her
lodgings
before
she
was
again
confined
to
her
bed
and
suffering
under
severe
and
constant
pain
;
and
all
this
among
strangers
,
with
the
absolute
necessity
of
having
a
regular
nurse
,
and
finances
at
that
moment
particularly
unfit
to
meet
any
extraordinary
expense
.
<EOS>
She
had
weathered
it
,
however
,
and
could
truly
say
that
it
had
done
her
good
.
<EOS>
It
had
increased
her
comforts
by
making
her
feel
herself
to
be
in
good
hands
.
<EOS>
She
had
seen
too
much
of
the
world
,
to
expect
sudden
or
disinterested
attachment
anywhere
,
but
her
illness
had
proved
to
her
that
her
landlady
had
a
character
to
preserve
,
and
would
not
use
her
ill
;
and
she
had
been
particularly
fortunate
in
her
nurse
,
as
a
sister
of
her
landlady
,
a
nurse
by
profession
,
and
who
had
always
a
home
in
that
house
when
unemployed
,
chanced
to
be
at
liberty
just
in
time
to
attend
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
,
"
said
Mrs
Smith
,
"
besides
nursing
me
most
admirably
,
has
really
proved
an
invaluable
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
could
use
my
hands
she
taught
me
to
knit
,
which
has
been
a
great
amusement
;
and
she
put
me
in
the
way
of
making
these
little
thread
-
cases
,
pin
-
cushions
and
card
-
racks
,
which
you
always
find
me
so
busy
about
,
and
which
supply
me
with
the
means
of
doing
a
little
good
to
one
or
two
very
poor
families
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
large
acquaintance
,
of
course
professionally
,
among
those
who
can
afford
to
buy
,
and
she
disposes
of
my
merchandise
.
<EOS>
She
always
takes
the
right
time
for
applying
.
<EOS>
Everybody
's
heart
is
open
,
you
know
,
when
they
have
recently
escaped
from
severe
pain
,
or
are
recovering
the
blessing
of
health
,
and
Nurse
Rooke
thoroughly
understands
when
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
shrewd
,
intelligent
,
sensible
woman
.
<EOS>
Hers
is
a
line
for
seeing
human
nature
;
and
she
has
a
fund
of
good
sense
and
observation
,
which
,
as
a
companion
,
make
her
infinitely
superior
to
thousands
of
those
who
having
only
received
"
the
best
education
in
the
world
,
"
know
nothing
worth
attending
to
.
<EOS>
Call
it
gossip
,
if
you
will
,
but
when
Nurse
Rooke
has
half
an
hour
's
leisure
to
bestow
on
me
,
she
is
sure
to
have
something
to
relate
that
is
entertaining
and
profitable
:
something
that
makes
one
know
one
's
species
better
.
<EOS>
One
likes
to
hear
what
is
going
on
,
to
be
au
fait
as
to
the
newest
modes
of
being
trifling
and
silly
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
who
live
so
much
alone
,
her
conversation
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
,
is
a
treat
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
far
from
wishing
to
cavil
at
the
pleasure
,
replied
,
"
I
can
easily
believe
it
.
<EOS>
Women
of
that
class
have
great
opportunities
,
and
if
they
are
intelligent
may
be
well
worth
listening
to
.
<EOS>
Such
varieties
of
human
nature
as
they
are
in
the
habit
of
witnessing
!
<EOS>
And
it
is
not
merely
in
its
follies
,
that
they
are
well
read
;
for
they
see
it
occasionally
under
every
circumstance
that
can
be
most
interesting
or
affecting
.
<EOS>
What
instances
must
pass
before
them
of
ardent
,
disinterested
,
self
-
denying
attachment
,
of
heroism
,
fortitude
,
patience
,
resignation
:
of
all
the
conflicts
and
all
the
sacrifices
that
ennoble
us
most
.
<EOS>
A
sick
chamber
may
often
furnish
the
worth
of
volumes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs
Smith
more
doubtingly
,
"
<EOS>
sometimes
it
may
,
though
I
fear
its
lessons
are
not
often
in
the
elevated
style
you
describe
.
<EOS>
Here
and
there
,
human
nature
may
be
great
in
times
of
trial
;
but
generally
speaking
,
it
is
its
weakness
and
not
its
strength
that
appears
in
a
sick
chamber
:
<EOS>
it
is
selfishness
and
impatience
rather
than
generosity
and
fortitude
,
that
one
hears
of
.
<EOS>
There
is
so
little
real
friendship
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
and
unfortunately
"
(
speaking
low
and
tremulously
)
"
there
are
so
many
who
forget
to
think
seriously
till
it
is
almost
too
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
saw
the
misery
of
such
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
husband
had
not
been
what
he
ought
,
and
the
wife
had
been
led
among
that
part
of
mankind
which
made
her
think
worse
of
the
world
than
she
hoped
it
deserved
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
passing
emotion
however
with
Mrs
Smith
;
she
shook
it
off
,
and
soon
added
in
a
different
tone
    
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
suppose
the
situation
my
friend
Mrs
Rooke
is
in
at
present
,
will
furnish
much
either
to
interest
or
edify
me
.
<EOS>
She
is
only
nursing
Mrs
Wallis
of
Marlborough
Buildings
;
a
mere
pretty
,
silly
,
expensive
,
fashionable
woman
,
I
believe
;
and
of
course
will
have
nothing
to
report
but
of
lace
and
finery
.
<EOS>
I
mean
to
make
my
profit
of
Mrs
Wallis
,
however
.
<EOS>
She
has
plenty
of
money
,
and
I
intend
she
shall
buy
all
the
high
-
priced
things
I
have
in
hand
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
called
several
times
on
her
friend
,
before
the
existence
of
such
a
person
was
known
in
Camden
Place
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
it
became
necessary
to
speak
of
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
Elizabeth
and
Mrs
Clay
,
returned
one
morning
from
Laura
Place
,
with
a
sudden
invitation
from
Lady
Dalrymple
for
the
same
evening
,
and
Anne
was
already
engaged
,
to
spend
that
evening
in
Westgate
Buildings
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
sorry
for
the
excuse
.
<EOS>
They
were
only
asked
,
she
was
sure
,
because
Lady
Dalrymple
being
kept
at
home
by
a
bad
cold
,
was
glad
to
make
use
of
the
relationship
which
had
been
so
pressed
on
her
;
and
she
declined
on
her
own
account
with
great
alacrity
 
<EOS>
"
She
was
engaged
to
spend
the
evening
with
an
old
schoolfellow
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
not
much
interested
in
anything
relative
to
Anne
;
but
still
there
were
questions
enough
asked
,
to
make
it
understood
what
this
old
schoolfellow
was
;
and
Elizabeth
was
disdainful
,
and
Sir
Walter
severe
.
  
<EOS>
"
Westgate
Buildings
!
"
said
he
,
"
and
who
is
Miss
Anne
Elliot
to
be
visiting
in
Westgate
Buildings
?
<EOS>
A
Mrs
Smith
.
<EOS>
A
widow
Mrs
Smith
;
and
who
was
her
husband
?
<EOS>
One
of
five
thousand
Mr
Smiths
whose
names
are
to
be
met
with
everywhere
.
<EOS>
And
what
is
her
attraction
?
<EOS>
That
she
is
old
and
sickly
.
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
Miss
Anne
Elliot
,
you
have
the
most
extraordinary
taste
!
<EOS>
Everything
that
revolts
other
people
,
low
company
,
paltry
rooms
,
foul
air
,
disgusting
associations
are
inviting
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
surely
you
may
put
off
this
old
lady
till
to
-
morrow
:
she
is
not
so
near
her
end
,
I
presume
,
but
that
she
may
hope
to
see
another
day
.
<EOS>
What
is
her
age
?
<EOS>
Forty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
she
is
not
one
-
and
-
thirty
;
but
I
do
not
think
I
can
put
off
my
engagement
,
because
it
is
the
only
evening
for
some
time
which
will
at
once
suit
her
and
myself
.
<EOS>
She
goes
into
the
warm
bath
to
-
morrow
,
and
for
the
rest
of
the
week
,
you
know
,
we
are
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
what
does
Lady
Russell
think
of
this
acquaintance
?
"
asked
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
sees
nothing
to
blame
in
it
,
"
replied
Anne
;
"
on
the
contrary
,
she
approves
it
,
and
has
generally
taken
me
when
I
have
called
on
Mrs
Smith
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Westgate
Buildings
must
have
been
rather
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
carriage
drawn
up
near
its
pavement
,
"
observed
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
Russell
's
widow
,
indeed
,
has
no
honours
to
distinguish
her
arms
,
but
still
it
is
a
handsome
equipage
,
and
no
doubt
is
well
known
to
convey
a
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
A
widow
Mrs
Smith
lodging
in
Westgate
Buildings
!
<EOS>
A
poor
widow
barely
able
to
live
,
between
thirty
and
forty
;
a
mere
Mrs
Smith
,
an
every
-
day
Mrs
Smith
,
of
all
people
and
all
names
in
the
world
,
to
be
the
chosen
friend
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot
,
and
to
be
preferred
by
her
to
her
own
family
connections
among
the
nobility
of
England
and
Ireland
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
!
<EOS>
Such
a
name
!
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
,
who
had
been
present
while
all
this
passed
,
now
thought
it
advisable
to
leave
the
room
,
and
Anne
could
have
said
much
,
and
did
long
to
say
a
little
in
defence
of
her
friend
's
not
very
dissimilar
claims
to
theirs
,
but
her
sense
of
personal
respect
to
her
father
prevented
her
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
She
left
it
to
himself
to
recollect
,
that
Mrs
Smith
was
not
the
only
widow
in
Bath
between
thirty
and
forty
,
with
little
to
live
on
,
and
no
surname
of
dignity
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
kept
her
appointment
;
the
others
kept
theirs
,
and
of
course
she
heard
the
next
morning
that
they
had
had
a
delightful
evening
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
the
only
one
of
the
set
absent
,
for
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
had
not
only
been
quite
at
her
ladyship
's
service
themselves
,
but
had
actually
been
happy
to
be
employed
by
her
in
collecting
others
,
and
had
been
at
the
trouble
of
inviting
both
Lady
Russell
and
Mr
Elliot
;
and
Mr
Elliot
had
made
a
point
of
leaving
Colonel
Wallis
early
,
and
Lady
Russell
had
fresh
arranged
all
her
evening
engagements
in
order
to
wait
on
her
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
the
whole
history
of
all
that
such
an
evening
could
supply
from
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
To
her
,
its
greatest
interest
must
be
,
in
having
been
very
much
talked
of
between
her
friend
and
Mr
Elliot
;
in
having
been
wished
for
,
regretted
,
and
at
the
same
time
honoured
for
staying
away
in
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
Her
kind
,
compassionate
visits
to
this
old
schoolfellow
,
sick
and
reduced
,
seemed
to
have
quite
delighted
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
thought
her
a
most
extraordinary
young
woman
;
in
her
temper
,
manners
,
mind
,
a
model
of
female
excellence
.
<EOS>
He
could
meet
even
Lady
Russell
in
a
discussion
of
her
merits
;
and
Anne
could
not
be
given
to
understand
so
much
by
her
friend
,
could
not
know
herself
to
be
so
highly
rated
by
a
sensible
man
,
without
many
of
those
agreeable
sensations
which
her
friend
meant
to
create
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
was
now
perfectly
decided
in
her
opinion
of
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
much
convinced
of
his
meaning
to
gain
Anne
in
time
as
of
his
deserving
her
,
and
was
beginning
to
calculate
the
number
of
weeks
which
would
free
him
from
all
the
remaining
restraints
of
widowhood
,
and
leave
him
at
liberty
to
exert
his
most
open
powers
of
pleasing
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
speak
to
Anne
with
half
the
certainty
she
felt
on
the
subject
,
she
would
venture
on
little
more
than
hints
of
what
might
be
hereafter
,
of
a
possible
attachment
on
his
side
,
of
the
desirableness
of
the
alliance
,
supposing
such
attachment
to
be
real
and
returned
.
<EOS>
Anne
heard
her
,
and
made
no
violent
exclamations
;
she
only
smiled
,
blushed
,
and
gently
shook
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
no
match
-
maker
,
as
you
well
know
,
"
said
Lady
Russell
,
"
being
much
too
well
aware
of
the
uncertainty
of
all
human
events
and
calculations
.
<EOS>
I
only
mean
that
if
Mr
Elliot
should
some
time
hence
pay
his
addresses
to
you
,
and
if
you
should
be
disposed
to
accept
him
,
I
think
there
would
be
every
possibility
of
your
being
happy
together
.
<EOS>
A
most
suitable
connection
everybody
must
consider
it
,
but
I
think
it
might
be
a
very
happy
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Elliot
is
an
exceedingly
agreeable
man
,
and
in
many
respects
I
think
highly
of
him
,
"
said
Anne
;
"
but
we
should
not
suit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
let
this
pass
,
and
only
said
in
rejoinder
,
"
I
own
that
to
be
able
to
regard
you
as
the
future
mistress
of
Kellynch
,
the
future
Lady
Elliot
,
to
look
forward
and
see
you
occupying
your
dear
mother
's
place
,
succeeding
to
all
her
rights
,
and
all
her
popularity
,
as
well
as
to
all
her
virtues
,
would
be
the
highest
possible
gratification
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
your
mother
's
self
in
countenance
and
disposition
;
and
if
I
might
be
allowed
to
fancy
you
such
as
she
was
,
in
situation
and
name
,
and
home
,
presiding
and
blessing
in
the
same
spot
,
and
only
superior
to
her
in
being
more
highly
valued
!
<EOS>
My
dearest
Anne
,
it
would
give
me
more
delight
than
is
often
felt
at
my
time
of
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
obliged
to
turn
away
,
to
rise
,
to
walk
to
a
distant
table
,
and
,
leaning
there
in
pretended
employment
,
try
to
subdue
the
feelings
this
picture
excited
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
her
imagination
and
her
heart
were
bewitched
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
becoming
what
her
mother
had
been
;
of
having
the
precious
name
of
"
Lady
Elliot
"
first
revived
in
herself
;
of
being
restored
to
Kellynch
,
calling
it
her
home
again
,
her
home
for
ever
,
was
a
charm
which
she
could
not
immediately
resist
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
said
not
another
word
,
willing
to
leave
the
matter
to
its
own
operation
;
and
believing
that
,
could
Mr
Elliot
at
that
moment
with
propriety
have
spoken
for
himself
!
 
<EOS>
she
believed
,
in
short
,
what
Anne
did
not
believe
.
<EOS>
The
same
image
of
Mr
Elliot
speaking
for
himself
brought
Anne
to
composure
again
.
<EOS>
The
charm
of
Kellynch
and
of
"
Lady
Elliot
"
all
faded
away
.
<EOS>
She
never
could
accept
him
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
not
only
that
her
feelings
were
still
adverse
to
any
man
save
one
;
her
judgement
,
on
a
serious
consideration
of
the
possibilities
of
such
a
case
was
against
Mr
Elliot
.
  
<EOS>
Though
they
had
now
been
acquainted
a
month
,
she
could
not
be
satisfied
that
she
really
knew
his
character
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
a
sensible
man
,
an
agreeable
man
,
that
he
talked
well
,
professed
good
opinions
,
seemed
to
judge
properly
and
as
a
man
of
principle
,
this
was
all
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
He
certainly
knew
what
was
right
,
nor
could
she
fix
on
any
one
article
of
moral
duty
evidently
transgressed
;
but
yet
she
would
have
been
afraid
to
answer
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
distrusted
the
past
,
if
not
the
present
.
<EOS>
The
names
which
occasionally
dropt
of
former
associates
,
the
allusions
to
former
practices
and
pursuits
,
suggested
suspicions
not
favourable
of
what
he
had
been
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
there
had
been
bad
habits
;
that
Sunday
travelling
had
been
a
common
thing
;
that
there
had
been
a
period
of
his
life
(
and
probably
not
a
short
one
)
<EOS>
when
he
had
been
,
at
least
,
careless
in
all
serious
matters
;
and
,
though
he
might
now
think
very
differently
,
who
could
answer
for
the
true
sentiments
of
a
clever
,
cautious
man
,
grown
old
enough
to
appreciate
a
fair
character
?
<EOS>
How
could
it
ever
be
ascertained
that
his
mind
was
truly
cleansed
?
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
rational
,
discreet
,
polished
,
but
he
was
not
open
.
<EOS>
There
was
never
any
burst
of
feeling
,
any
warmth
of
indignation
or
delight
,
at
the
evil
or
good
of
others
.
<EOS>
This
,
to
Anne
,
was
a
decided
imperfection
.
<EOS>
Her
early
impressions
were
incurable
.
<EOS>
She
prized
the
frank
,
the
open
-
hearted
,
the
eager
character
beyond
all
others
.
<EOS>
Warmth
and
enthusiasm
did
captivate
her
still
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
could
so
much
more
depend
upon
the
sincerity
of
those
who
sometimes
looked
or
said
a
careless
or
a
hasty
thing
,
than
of
those
whose
presence
of
mind
never
varied
,
whose
tongue
never
slipped
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
too
generally
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Various
as
were
the
tempers
in
her
father
's
house
,
he
pleased
them
all
.
<EOS>
He
endured
too
well
,
stood
too
well
with
every
body
.
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
to
her
with
some
degree
of
openness
of
Mrs
Clay
;
had
appeared
completely
to
see
what
Mrs
Clay
was
about
,
and
to
hold
her
in
contempt
;
and
yet
Mrs
Clay
found
him
as
agreeable
as
any
body
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
saw
either
less
or
more
than
her
young
friend
,
for
she
saw
nothing
to
excite
distrust
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
imagine
a
man
more
exactly
what
he
ought
to
be
than
Mr
Elliot
;
nor
did
she
ever
enjoy
a
sweeter
feeling
than
the
hope
of
seeing
him
receive
the
hand
of
her
beloved
Anne
in
Kellynch
church
,
in
the
course
of
the
following
autumn
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
the
beginning
of
February
;
and
Anne
,
having
been
a
month
in
Bath
,
was
growing
very
eager
for
news
from
Uppercross
and
Lyme
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
hear
much
more
than
Mary
had
communicated
.
<EOS>
It
was
three
weeks
since
she
had
heard
at
all
.
<EOS>
She
only
knew
that
Henrietta
was
at
home
again
;
and
that
Louisa
,
though
considered
to
be
recovering
fast
,
was
still
in
Lyme
;
and
she
was
thinking
of
them
all
very
intently
one
evening
,
<EOS>
when
a
thicker
letter
than
usual
from
Mary
was
delivered
to
her
;
and
,
to
quicken
the
pleasure
and
surprise
,
with
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
's
compliments
.
  
<EOS>
The
Crofts
must
be
in
Bath
!
<EOS>
A
circumstance
to
interest
her
.
<EOS>
They
were
people
whom
her
heart
turned
to
very
naturally
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
?
"
cried
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Crofts
have
arrived
in
Bath
?
<EOS>
The
Crofts
who
rent
Kellynch
?
<EOS>
What
have
they
brought
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
letter
from
Uppercross
Cottage
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
those
letters
are
convenient
passports
.
<EOS>
They
secure
an
introduction
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
visited
Admiral
Croft
,
however
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
is
due
to
my
tenant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
listen
no
longer
;
she
could
not
even
have
told
how
the
poor
Admiral
's
complexion
escaped
;
her
letter
engrossed
her
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
begun
several
days
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
February
1st
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Anne
,
 
I
make
no
apology
for
my
silence
,
because
I
know
how
little
people
think
of
letters
in
such
a
place
as
Bath
.
<EOS>
You
must
be
a
great
deal
too
happy
to
care
for
Uppercross
,
<EOS>
which
,
as
you
well
know
,
affords
little
to
write
about
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
very
dull
Christmas
;
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
have
not
had
one
dinner
party
all
the
holidays
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
reckon
the
Hayters
as
anybody
.
<EOS>
The
holidays
,
however
,
are
over
at
last
:
I
believe
no
children
ever
had
such
long
ones
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
I
had
not
.
<EOS>
The
house
was
cleared
yesterday
,
except
of
the
little
Harvilles
;
but
you
will
be
surprised
to
hear
they
have
never
gone
home
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
must
be
an
odd
mother
to
part
with
them
so
long
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
They
are
not
at
all
nice
children
,
in
my
opinion
;
but
Mrs
Musgrove
seems
to
like
them
quite
as
well
,
if
not
better
,
than
her
grandchildren
.
<EOS>
What
dreadful
weather
we
have
had
!
<EOS>
It
may
not
be
felt
in
Bath
,
with
your
nice
pavements
;
but
in
the
country
it
is
of
some
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
had
a
creature
call
on
me
since
the
second
week
in
January
,
except
Charles
Hayter
,
who
had
been
calling
much
oftener
than
was
welcome
.
<EOS>
Between
ourselves
,
I
think
it
a
great
pity
<EOS>
Henrietta
did
not
remain
at
Lyme
as
long
as
Louisa
;
it
would
have
kept
her
a
little
out
of
his
way
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
is
gone
to
-
day
,
to
bring
Louisa
and
the
Harvilles
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
asked
to
dine
with
them
,
however
,
till
the
day
after
,
Mrs
Musgrove
is
so
afraid
of
her
being
fatigued
by
the
journey
,
which
is
not
very
likely
,
considering
the
care
that
will
be
taken
of
her
;
and
it
would
be
much
more
convenient
to
me
to
dine
there
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
you
find
Mr
Elliot
so
agreeable
,
and
wish
I
could
be
acquainted
with
him
too
;
but
I
have
my
usual
luck
:
I
am
always
out
of
the
way
when
any
thing
desirable
is
going
on
;
always
the
last
of
my
family
to
be
noticed
.
<EOS>
What
an
immense
time
Mrs
Clay
has
been
staying
with
Elizabeth
!
<EOS>
Does
she
never
mean
to
go
away
?
<EOS>
But
perhaps
if
she
were
to
leave
the
room
vacant
,
we
might
not
be
invited
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
what
you
think
of
this
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
expect
my
children
to
be
asked
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
can
leave
them
at
the
Great
House
very
well
,
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
.
<EOS>
I
have
this
moment
heard
that
the
Crofts
are
going
to
Bath
almost
immediately
;
they
think
the
Admiral
gouty
.
<EOS>
Charles
heard
it
quite
by
chance
;
they
have
not
had
the
civility
to
give
me
any
notice
,
or
of
offering
to
take
anything
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
improve
at
all
as
neighbours
.
<EOS>
We
see
nothing
of
them
,
and
this
is
really
an
instance
of
gross
inattention
.
<EOS>
Charles
joins
me
in
love
,
and
everything
proper
.
<EOS>
Yours
affectionately
,
  
"
Mary
M
 
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
I
am
very
far
from
well
;
and
Jemima
has
just
told
me
that
the
butcher
says
there
is
a
bad
sore
-
throat
very
much
about
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
I
shall
catch
it
;
and
my
sore
-
throats
,
you
know
,
are
always
worse
than
anybody
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
ended
the
first
part
,
which
had
been
afterwards
put
into
an
envelope
,
containing
nearly
as
much
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
kept
my
letter
open
,
that
I
might
send
you
word
how
Louisa
bore
her
journey
,
and
now
I
am
extremely
glad
I
did
,
having
a
great
deal
to
add
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
I
had
a
note
from
Mrs
Croft
yesterday
,
offering
to
convey
anything
to
you
;
a
very
kind
,
friendly
note
indeed
,
addressed
to
me
,
just
as
it
ought
;
I
shall
therefore
be
able
to
make
my
letter
as
long
as
I
like
.
<EOS>
The
Admiral
does
not
seem
very
ill
,
and
I
sincerely
hope
Bath
will
do
him
all
the
good
he
wants
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
truly
glad
to
have
them
back
again
.
<EOS>
Our
neighbourhood
can
not
spare
such
a
pleasant
family
.
<EOS>
But
now
for
Louisa
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
communicate
that
will
astonish
you
not
a
little
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
Harvilles
came
on
Tuesday
very
safely
,
and
in
the
evening
we
went
to
ask
her
how
she
did
,
when
we
were
rather
surprised
not
to
find
Captain
Benwick
of
the
party
,
for
he
had
been
invited
as
well
as
the
Harvilles
;
and
what
do
you
think
was
the
reason
?
<EOS>
Neither
more
nor
less
than
his
being
in
love
with
Louisa
,
and
not
choosing
to
venture
to
Uppercross
till
he
had
had
an
answer
from
Mr
Musgrove
;
for
it
was
all
settled
between
him
and
her
before
she
came
away
,
and
he
had
written
to
her
father
by
Captain
Harville
.
<EOS>
True
,
upon
my
honour
!
<EOS>
Are
not
you
astonished
?
<EOS>
I
shall
be
surprised
at
least
if
you
ever
received
a
hint
of
it
,
for
I
never
did
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
protests
solemnly
that
she
knew
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
very
well
pleased
,
however
,
for
though
it
is
not
equal
to
her
marrying
Captain
Wentworth
<EOS>
,
it
is
infinitely
better
than
Charles
Hayter
;
and
Mr
Musgrove
has
written
his
consent
,
and
Captain
Benwick
is
expected
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
says
her
husband
feels
a
good
deal
on
his
poor
sister
's
account
;
but
,
however
,
Louisa
is
a
great
favourite
with
both
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mrs
Harville
and
I
quite
agree
that
we
love
her
the
better
for
having
nursed
her
.
<EOS>
Charles
wonders
what
Captain
Wentworth
will
say
;
but
if
you
remember
,
I
never
thought
him
attached
to
Louisa
;
I
never
could
see
anything
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
the
end
,
you
see
,
of
Captain
Benwick
's
being
supposed
to
be
an
admirer
of
yours
.
<EOS>
How
Charles
could
take
such
a
thing
into
his
head
was
always
incomprehensible
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
will
be
more
agreeable
now
.
<EOS>
Certainly
not
a
great
match
for
Louisa
Musgrove
,
but
a
million
times
better
than
marrying
among
the
Hayters
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mary
need
not
have
feared
her
sister
's
being
in
any
degree
prepared
for
the
news
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
in
her
life
been
more
astonished
.
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
and
Louisa
Musgrove
!
<EOS>
It
was
almost
too
wonderful
for
belief
,
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
effort
that
she
could
remain
in
the
room
,
preserve
an
air
of
calmness
,
and
answer
the
common
questions
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Happily
for
her
,
they
were
not
many
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
wanted
to
know
whether
the
Crofts
travelled
with
four
horses
,
and
whether
they
were
likely
to
be
situated
in
such
a
part
of
Bath
as
it
might
suit
Miss
Elliot
and
himself
to
visit
in
;
but
had
little
curiosity
beyond
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
Mary
?
"
said
Elizabeth
;
and
without
waiting
for
an
answer
,
"
And
pray
what
brings
the
Crofts
to
Bath
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
come
on
the
Admiral
's
account
.
<EOS>
He
is
thought
to
be
gouty
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gout
and
decrepitude
!
<EOS>
"
said
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
they
any
acquaintance
here
?
"
asked
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
;
but
I
can
hardly
suppose
that
,
at
Admiral
Croft
's
time
of
life
,
and
in
his
profession
,
he
should
not
have
many
acquaintance
in
such
a
place
as
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suspect
,
"
said
Sir
Walter
coolly
,
"
that
Admiral
Croft
will
be
best
known
in
Bath
as
the
renter
of
Kellynch
Hall
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
may
we
venture
to
present
him
and
his
wife
in
Laura
Place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
think
not
.
<EOS>
Situated
as
we
are
with
Lady
Dalrymple
,
cousins
,
we
ought
to
be
very
careful
not
to
embarrass
her
with
acquaintance
she
might
not
approve
.
<EOS>
If
we
were
not
related
,
it
would
not
signify
;
but
as
cousins
,
she
would
feel
scrupulous
as
to
any
proposal
of
ours
.
<EOS>
We
had
better
leave
the
Crofts
to
find
their
own
level
.
<EOS>
There
are
several
odd
-
looking
men
walking
about
here
,
who
,
I
am
told
,
are
sailors
.
<EOS>
The
Crofts
will
associate
with
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
's
share
of
interest
in
the
letter
;
when
Mrs
Clay
had
paid
her
tribute
of
more
decent
attention
,
in
an
enquiry
after
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
,
and
her
fine
little
boys
,
Anne
was
at
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
In
her
own
room
,
she
tried
to
comprehend
it
.
<EOS>
Well
might
Charles
wonder
how
Captain
Wentworth
would
feel
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
had
quitted
the
field
,
had
given
Louisa
up
,
had
ceased
to
love
,
had
found
he
did
not
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
the
idea
of
treachery
or
levity
,
or
anything
akin
to
ill
usage
between
him
and
his
friend
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
endure
that
such
a
friendship
as
theirs
should
be
severed
unfairly
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Benwick
and
Louisa
Musgrove
!
<EOS>
The
high
-
spirited
,
joyous
-
talking
Louisa
Musgrove
,
and
the
dejected
,
thinking
,
feeling
,
reading
,
Captain
Benwick
,
seemed
each
of
them
everything
that
would
not
suit
the
other
.
<EOS>
Their
minds
most
dissimilar
!
<EOS>
Where
could
have
been
the
attraction
?
<EOS>
The
answer
soon
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
in
situation
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
thrown
together
several
weeks
;
they
had
been
living
in
the
same
small
family
party
:
since
Henrietta
's
coming
away
,
they
must
have
been
depending
almost
entirely
on
each
other
,
and
Louisa
,
just
recovering
from
illness
,
had
been
in
an
interesting
state
,
and
Captain
Benwick
was
not
inconsolable
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
point
which
Anne
had
not
been
able
to
avoid
suspecting
before
;
and
instead
of
drawing
the
same
conclusion
as
Mary
,
from
the
present
course
of
events
,
they
served
only
to
confirm
the
idea
of
his
having
felt
some
dawning
of
tenderness
toward
herself
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
mean
,
however
,
to
derive
much
more
from
it
to
gratify
her
vanity
,
than
Mary
might
have
allowed
.
<EOS>
She
was
persuaded
that
any
tolerably
pleasing
young
woman
who
had
listened
and
seemed
to
feel
for
him
would
have
received
the
same
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
affectionate
heart
.
<EOS>
He
must
love
somebody
.
  
<EOS>
She
saw
no
reason
against
their
being
happy
.
<EOS>
Louisa
had
fine
naval
fervour
to
begin
with
,
and
they
would
soon
grow
more
alike
.
<EOS>
He
would
gain
cheerfulness
,
and
she
would
learn
to
be
an
enthusiast
for
Scott
and
Lord
Byron
;
nay
,
that
was
probably
learnt
already
;
of
course
they
had
fallen
in
love
over
poetry
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Louisa
Musgrove
turned
into
a
person
of
literary
taste
,
and
sentimental
reflection
was
amusing
,
but
she
had
no
doubt
of
its
being
so
.
<EOS>
The
day
at
Lyme
,
the
fall
from
the
Cobb
,
might
influence
her
health
,
her
nerves
,
her
courage
,
her
character
to
the
end
of
her
life
,
as
thoroughly
as
it
appeared
to
have
influenced
her
fate
.
  
<EOS>
The
conclusion
of
the
whole
was
,
that
if
the
woman
who
had
been
sensible
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
merits
could
be
allowed
to
prefer
another
man
,
there
was
nothing
in
the
engagement
to
excite
lasting
wonder
;
and
if
Captain
Wentworth
lost
no
friend
by
it
,
certainly
nothing
to
be
regretted
.
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
not
regret
which
made
Anne
's
heart
beat
in
spite
of
herself
,
and
brought
the
colour
into
her
cheeks
when
she
thought
of
Captain
Wentworth
unshackled
and
free
.
<EOS>
She
had
some
feelings
which
she
was
ashamed
to
investigate
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
much
like
joy
,
senseless
joy
!
  
<EOS>
She
longed
to
see
the
Crofts
;
but
when
the
meeting
took
place
,
it
was
evident
that
no
rumour
of
the
news
had
yet
reached
them
.
<EOS>
The
visit
of
ceremony
was
paid
and
returned
;
and
Louisa
Musgrove
was
mentioned
,
and
Captain
Benwick
,
too
,
without
even
half
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
The
Crofts
had
placed
themselves
in
lodgings
in
Gay
Street
,
perfectly
to
Sir
Walter
's
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
all
ashamed
of
the
acquaintance
,
and
did
,
in
fact
,
think
and
talk
a
great
deal
more
about
the
Admiral
,
than
the
Admiral
ever
thought
or
talked
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
Crofts
knew
quite
as
many
people
in
Bath
as
they
wished
for
,
and
considered
their
intercourse
with
the
Elliots
as
a
mere
matter
of
form
,
and
not
in
the
least
likely
to
afford
them
any
pleasure
.
<EOS>
They
brought
with
them
their
country
habit
of
being
almost
always
together
.
<EOS>
He
was
ordered
to
walk
to
keep
off
the
gout
,
and
Mrs
Croft
seemed
to
go
shares
with
him
in
everything
,
and
to
walk
for
her
life
to
do
him
good
.
<EOS>
Anne
saw
them
wherever
she
went
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
took
her
out
in
her
carriage
almost
every
morning
,
and
she
never
failed
to
think
of
them
,
and
never
failed
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Knowing
their
feelings
as
she
did
,
it
was
a
most
attractive
picture
of
happiness
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
always
watched
them
as
long
as
she
could
,
delighted
to
fancy
<EOS>
she
understood
what
they
might
be
talking
of
,
as
they
walked
along
in
happy
independence
,
or
equally
delighted
to
see
the
Admiral
's
hearty
shake
of
the
hand
when
he
encountered
an
old
friend
,
and
observe
their
eagerness
of
conversation
when
occasionally
forming
into
a
little
knot
of
the
navy
,
Mrs
Croft
looking
as
intelligent
and
keen
as
any
of
the
officers
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
too
much
engaged
with
Lady
Russell
to
be
often
walking
herself
;
but
it
so
happened
that
one
morning
,
about
a
week
or
ten
days
after
the
Croft
's
arrival
,
it
suited
her
best
to
leave
her
friend
,
or
her
friend
's
carriage
,
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
,
and
return
alone
to
Camden
Place
,
and
in
walking
up
Milsom
Street
she
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
with
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
He
was
standing
by
himself
at
a
printshop
window
,
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
in
earnest
contemplation
of
some
print
,
and
she
not
only
might
have
passed
him
unseen
,
but
was
obliged
to
touch
as
well
as
address
him
before
she
could
catch
his
notice
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
perceive
and
acknowledge
her
,
however
,
it
was
done
with
all
his
usual
frankness
and
good
humour
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
treating
me
like
a
friend
.
<EOS>
Here
I
am
,
you
see
,
staring
at
a
picture
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
get
by
this
shop
without
stopping
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
thing
here
is
,
by
way
of
a
boat
!
<EOS>
Do
look
at
it
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
the
like
?
<EOS>
What
queer
fellows
your
fine
painters
must
be
,
to
think
that
anybody
would
venture
their
lives
in
such
a
shapeless
old
cockleshell
as
that
?
<EOS>
And
yet
here
are
two
gentlemen
stuck
up
in
it
mightily
at
their
ease
,
and
looking
about
them
at
the
rocks
and
mountains
,
as
if
they
were
not
to
be
upset
the
next
moment
,
which
they
certainly
must
be
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
that
boat
was
built
!
"
<EOS>
(
laughing
heartily
)
;
"
I
would
not
venture
over
a
horsepond
in
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
"
(
turning
away
)
,
"
now
,
where
are
you
bound
?
<EOS>
Can
I
go
anywhere
for
you
,
or
with
you
?
<EOS>
Can
I
be
of
any
use
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
I
thank
you
,
unless
you
will
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
company
the
little
way
our
road
lies
together
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
will
,
with
all
my
heart
,
and
farther
,
too
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
we
will
have
a
snug
walk
together
,
and
I
have
something
to
tell
you
as
we
go
along
.
<EOS>
There
,
take
my
arm
;
that
's
right
;
I
do
not
feel
comfortable
if
I
have
not
a
woman
there
.
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
what
a
boat
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
taking
a
last
look
at
the
picture
,
as
they
began
to
be
in
motion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
that
you
had
something
to
tell
me
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
have
,
presently
.
<EOS>
But
here
comes
a
friend
,
Captain
Brigden
;
I
shall
only
say
,
"
How
d'ye
do
?
"
<EOS>
as
we
pass
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
stop
.
<EOS>
"
How
d'ye
do
?
"
<EOS>
Brigden
stares
to
see
anybody
with
me
but
my
wife
.
<EOS>
She
,
poor
soul
,
is
tied
by
the
leg
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
blister
on
one
of
her
heels
,
as
large
as
a
three
-
shilling
piece
.
<EOS>
If
you
look
across
the
street
,
you
will
see
Admiral
Brand
coming
down
and
his
brother
.
<EOS>
Shabby
fellows
,
both
of
them
!
<EOS>
I
am
glad
they
are
not
on
this
side
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Sophy
can
not
bear
them
.
<EOS>
They
played
me
a
pitiful
trick
once
:
got
away
with
some
of
my
best
men
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
the
whole
story
another
time
.
<EOS>
There
comes
old
Sir
Archibald
Drew
and
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
Look
,
he
sees
us
;
he
kisses
his
hand
to
you
;
he
takes
you
for
my
wife
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
peace
has
come
too
soon
for
that
younker
.
<EOS>
Poor
old
Sir
Archibald
!
<EOS>
How
do
you
like
Bath
,
Miss
Elliot
?
<EOS>
It
suits
us
very
well
.
<EOS>
We
are
always
meeting
with
some
old
friend
or
other
;
the
streets
full
of
them
every
morning
;
sure
to
have
plenty
of
chat
;
and
then
we
get
away
from
them
all
,
and
shut
ourselves
in
our
lodgings
,
and
draw
in
our
chairs
,
and
are
snug
as
if
we
were
at
Kellynch
,
ay
,
or
as
we
used
to
be
even
at
North
Yarmouth
and
Deal
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
like
our
lodgings
here
the
worse
,
I
can
tell
you
,
for
putting
us
in
mind
of
those
we
first
had
at
North
Yarmouth
.
<EOS>
The
wind
blows
through
one
of
the
cupboards
just
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
When
they
were
got
a
little
farther
,
Anne
ventured
to
press
again
for
what
he
had
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
She
hoped
when
clear
of
Milsom
Street
to
have
her
curiosity
gratified
;
but
she
was
still
obliged
to
wait
,
for
the
Admiral
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
begin
till
they
had
gained
the
greater
space
and
quiet
of
Belmont
;
and
as
she
was
not
really
Mrs
Croft
,
she
must
let
him
have
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
fairly
ascending
Belmont
,
he
began
    
"
<EOS>
Well
,
now
you
shall
hear
something
that
will
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
But
first
of
all
,
you
must
tell
me
the
name
of
the
young
lady
I
am
going
to
talk
about
.
<EOS>
That
young
lady
,
you
know
,
that
we
have
all
been
so
concerned
for
.
<EOS>
The
Miss
Musgrove
,
that
all
this
has
been
happening
to
.
<EOS>
Her
Christian
name
:
I
always
forget
her
Christian
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
had
been
ashamed
to
appear
to
comprehend
so
soon
as
she
really
did
;
but
now
she
could
safely
suggest
the
name
of
"
Louisa
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Miss
Louisa
Musgrove
,
that
is
the
name
.
<EOS>
I
wish
young
ladies
had
not
such
a
number
of
fine
Christian
names
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
be
out
if
they
were
all
Sophys
,
or
something
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
Well
,
this
Miss
Louisa
,
we
all
thought
,
you
know
,
was
to
marry
Frederick
.
<EOS>
He
was
courting
her
week
after
week
.
<EOS>
The
only
wonder
was
,
what
they
could
be
waiting
for
,
till
the
business
at
Lyme
came
;
then
,
indeed
,
it
was
clear
enough
that
they
must
wait
till
her
brain
was
set
to
right
.
<EOS>
But
even
then
there
was
something
odd
in
their
way
of
going
on
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
staying
at
Lyme
,
he
went
off
to
Plymouth
,
and
then
he
went
off
to
see
Edward
.
<EOS>
When
we
came
back
from
Minehead
<EOS>
he
was
gone
down
to
Edward
's
,
and
there
he
has
been
ever
since
.
<EOS>
We
have
seen
nothing
of
him
since
November
.
<EOS>
Even
Sophy
could
not
understand
it
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
the
matter
has
taken
the
strangest
turn
of
all
;
for
this
young
lady
,
the
same
Miss
Musgrove
,
instead
of
being
to
marry
Frederick
,
is
to
marry
James
Benwick
.
<EOS>
You
know
James
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
A
little
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
little
acquainted
with
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
she
is
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
most
likely
they
are
married
already
,
for
I
do
not
know
what
they
should
wait
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
Captain
Benwick
a
very
pleasing
young
man
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
and
I
understand
that
he
bears
an
excellent
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
,
there
is
not
a
word
to
be
said
against
James
Benwick
.
<EOS>
He
is
only
a
commander
,
it
is
true
,
made
last
summer
,
and
these
are
bad
times
for
getting
on
,
but
he
has
not
another
fault
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
An
excellent
,
good
-
hearted
fellow
,
I
assure
you
;
a
very
active
,
zealous
officer
too
,
which
is
more
than
you
would
think
for
,
perhaps
,
for
that
soft
sort
of
manner
does
not
do
him
justice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
you
are
mistaken
there
,
sir
;
I
should
never
augur
want
of
spirit
from
Captain
Benwick
's
manners
.
<EOS>
I
thought
them
particularly
pleasing
,
and
I
will
answer
for
it
,
they
would
generally
please
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
ladies
are
the
best
judges
;
but
James
Benwick
is
rather
too
piano
for
me
;
and
though
very
likely
it
is
all
our
partiality
,
Sophy
and
I
can
not
help
thinking
Frederick
's
manners
better
than
his
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
about
Frederick
more
to
our
taste
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
caught
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
meant
to
oppose
the
too
common
idea
of
spirit
and
gentleness
being
incompatible
with
each
other
,
not
at
all
to
represent
Captain
Benwick
's
manners
as
the
very
best
that
could
possibly
be
;
and
,
after
a
little
hesitation
,
she
was
beginning
to
say
,
"
I
was
not
entering
into
any
comparison
of
the
two
friends
,
"
but
the
Admiral
interrupted
her
with
    
"
<EOS>
And
the
thing
is
certainly
true
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
mere
bit
of
gossip
.
<EOS>
We
have
it
from
Frederick
himself
.
<EOS>
His
sister
had
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
,
in
which
he
tells
us
of
it
,
and
he
had
just
had
it
in
a
letter
from
Harville
,
written
upon
the
spot
,
from
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
they
are
all
at
Uppercross
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
an
opportunity
which
Anne
could
not
resist
;
she
said
,
therefore
,
"
I
hope
,
Admiral
<EOS>
,
I
hope
there
is
nothing
in
the
style
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
letter
to
make
you
and
Mrs
Croft
particularly
uneasy
.
<EOS>
It
did
seem
,
last
autumn
,
as
if
there
were
an
attachment
between
him
and
Louisa
Musgrove
;
but
I
hope
it
may
be
understood
to
have
worn
out
on
each
side
equally
,
and
without
violence
.
<EOS>
I
hope
his
letter
does
not
breathe
the
spirit
of
an
ill
-
used
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
not
at
all
;
there
is
not
an
oath
or
a
murmur
from
beginning
to
end
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
looked
down
to
hide
her
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
Frederick
is
not
a
man
to
whine
and
complain
;
he
has
too
much
spirit
for
that
.
<EOS>
If
the
girl
likes
another
man
better
,
it
is
very
fit
she
should
have
him
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
But
what
I
mean
is
,
that
I
hope
there
is
nothing
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
manner
of
writing
to
make
you
suppose
he
thinks
himself
ill
-
used
by
his
friend
,
which
might
appear
,
you
know
,
without
its
being
absolutely
said
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
that
such
a
friendship
as
has
subsisted
between
him
and
Captain
Benwick
should
be
destroyed
,
or
even
wounded
,
by
a
circumstance
of
this
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
you
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
nothing
at
all
of
that
nature
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
does
not
give
the
least
fling
at
Benwick
;
does
not
so
much
as
say
,
"
I
wonder
at
it
,
I
have
a
reason
of
my
own
for
wondering
at
it
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
you
would
not
guess
,
from
his
way
of
writing
,
that
he
had
ever
thought
of
this
Miss
(
what
's
her
name
?
)
<EOS>
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
very
handsomely
hopes
they
will
be
happy
together
;
and
there
is
nothing
very
unforgiving
in
that
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
Anne
did
not
receive
the
perfect
conviction
which
the
Admiral
meant
to
convey
,
but
it
would
have
been
useless
to
press
the
enquiry
farther
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
satisfied
herself
with
common
-
place
remarks
or
quiet
attention
,
and
the
Admiral
had
it
all
his
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
Frederick
!
"
said
he
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
he
must
begin
all
over
again
with
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
I
think
we
must
get
him
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
Sophy
must
write
,
and
beg
him
to
come
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
Here
are
pretty
girls
enough
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
of
no
use
to
go
to
Uppercross
again
,
for
that
other
Miss
Musgrove
<EOS>
,
I
find
,
is
bespoke
by
her
cousin
,
the
young
parson
.
<EOS>
Do
not
you
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
we
had
better
try
to
get
him
to
Bath
?
"
    
<EOS>
While
Admiral
Croft
was
taking
this
walk
with
Anne
,
and
expressing
his
wish
of
getting
Captain
Wentworth
to
Bath
,
Captain
Wentworth
was
already
on
his
way
thither
.
<EOS>
Before
Mrs
Croft
had
written
,
he
was
arrived
,
and
the
very
next
time
Anne
walked
out
,
she
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
attending
his
two
cousins
and
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
Milsom
Street
.
<EOS>
It
began
to
rain
,
not
much
,
but
enough
to
make
shelter
desirable
for
women
,
and
quite
enough
to
make
it
very
desirable
for
Miss
Elliot
to
have
the
advantage
of
being
conveyed
home
in
Lady
Dalrymple
's
carriage
,
which
was
seen
waiting
at
a
little
distance
;
she
,
Anne
,
and
Mrs
Clay
,
therefore
,
turned
into
Molland
's
,
while
Mr
Elliot
stepped
to
Lady
Dalrymple
,
to
request
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
He
soon
joined
them
again
,
successful
,
of
course
;
Lady
Dalrymple
would
be
most
happy
to
take
them
home
,
and
would
call
for
them
in
a
few
minutes
.
  
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
's
carriage
was
a
barouche
,
and
did
not
hold
more
than
four
with
any
comfort
.
<EOS>
Miss
Carteret
was
with
her
mother
;
consequently
it
was
not
reasonable
to
expect
accommodation
for
all
the
three
Camden
Place
ladies
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
no
doubt
as
to
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
Whoever
suffered
inconvenience
,
she
must
suffer
none
,
but
it
occupied
a
little
time
to
settle
the
point
of
civility
between
the
other
two
.
<EOS>
The
rain
was
a
mere
trifle
,
and
Anne
was
most
sincere
in
preferring
a
walk
with
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
But
the
rain
was
also
a
mere
trifle
to
Mrs
Clay
;
she
would
hardly
allow
it
even
to
drop
at
all
,
and
her
boots
were
so
thick
!
<EOS>
much
thicker
than
Miss
Anne
's
;
and
,
in
short
,
her
civility
rendered
her
quite
as
anxious
to
be
left
to
walk
with
Mr
Elliot
as
Anne
could
be
,
and
it
was
discussed
between
them
with
a
generosity
so
polite
and
so
determined
,
that
the
others
were
obliged
to
settle
it
for
them
;
<EOS>
Miss
Elliot
maintaining
that
Mrs
Clay
had
a
little
cold
already
,
and
Mr
Elliot
deciding
on
appeal
,
that
his
cousin
Anne
's
boots
were
rather
the
thickest
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
fixed
accordingly
,
that
Mrs
Clay
should
be
of
the
party
in
the
carriage
;
and
they
had
just
reached
this
point
,
when
Anne
,
as
she
sat
near
the
window
,
descried
,
most
decidedly
and
distinctly
,
Captain
Wentworth
walking
down
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
Her
start
was
perceptible
only
to
herself
;
but
she
instantly
felt
that
she
was
the
greatest
simpleton
in
the
world
,
the
most
unaccountable
and
absurd
!
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
she
saw
nothing
before
her
;
it
was
all
confusion
.
<EOS>
She
was
lost
,
and
when
she
had
scolded
back
her
senses
,
she
found
the
others
still
waiting
for
the
carriage
,
and
Mr
Elliot
(
always
obliging
)
just
setting
off
for
Union
Street
on
a
commission
of
Mrs
Clay
's
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
felt
a
great
inclination
to
go
to
the
outer
door
;
she
wanted
to
see
if
it
rained
.
<EOS>
Why
was
she
to
suspect
herself
of
another
motive
?
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
must
be
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
She
left
her
seat
,
she
would
go
;
one
half
of
her
should
not
be
always
so
much
wiser
than
the
other
half
,
or
always
suspecting
the
other
of
being
worse
than
it
was
.
<EOS>
She
would
see
if
it
rained
.
<EOS>
She
was
sent
back
,
however
,
in
a
moment
by
the
entrance
of
Captain
Wentworth
himself
,
among
a
party
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
evidently
his
acquaintance
,
and
whom
he
must
have
joined
a
little
below
Milsom
Street
.
<EOS>
He
was
more
obviously
struck
and
confused
by
the
sight
of
her
than
she
had
ever
observed
before
;
he
looked
quite
red
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
,
since
their
renewed
acquaintance
,
she
felt
that
she
was
betraying
the
least
sensibility
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
advantage
of
him
in
the
preparation
of
the
last
few
moments
.
<EOS>
All
the
overpowering
,
blinding
,
bewildering
,
first
effects
of
strong
surprise
were
over
with
her
.
<EOS>
Still
,
however
,
she
had
enough
to
feel
!
<EOS>
It
was
agitation
,
pain
,
pleasure
,
a
something
between
delight
and
misery
.
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
to
her
,
and
then
turned
away
.
<EOS>
The
character
of
his
manner
was
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
have
called
it
either
cold
or
friendly
,
or
anything
so
certainly
as
embarrassed
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
short
interval
,
however
,
he
came
towards
her
,
and
spoke
again
.
<EOS>
Mutual
enquiries
on
common
subjects
passed
:
neither
of
them
,
probably
,
much
the
wiser
for
what
they
heard
,
and
Anne
continuing
fully
sensible
of
his
being
less
at
ease
than
formerly
.
<EOS>
They
had
by
dint
of
being
so
very
much
together
,
got
to
speak
to
each
other
with
a
considerable
portion
of
apparent
indifference
and
calmness
;
but
he
could
not
do
it
now
.
<EOS>
Time
had
changed
him
,
or
Louisa
had
changed
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
consciousness
of
some
sort
or
other
.
<EOS>
He
looked
very
well
,
not
as
if
he
had
been
suffering
in
health
or
spirits
,
and
he
talked
of
Uppercross
,
of
the
Musgroves
,
nay
,
even
of
Louisa
,
and
had
even
a
momentary
look
of
his
own
arch
significance
as
he
named
her
;
but
yet
it
was
Captain
Wentworth
not
comfortable
,
not
easy
,
not
able
to
feign
that
he
was
.
  
<EOS>
It
did
not
surprise
,
but
it
grieved
Anne
to
observe
that
Elizabeth
would
not
know
him
.
<EOS>
She
saw
that
he
saw
Elizabeth
,
that
Elizabeth
saw
him
,
that
there
was
complete
internal
recognition
on
each
side
;
she
was
convinced
that
he
was
ready
to
be
acknowledged
as
an
acquaintance
,
expecting
it
,
and
she
had
the
pain
of
seeing
her
sister
turn
away
with
unalterable
coldness
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
's
carriage
,
for
which
Miss
Elliot
was
growing
very
impatient
,
now
drew
up
;
the
servant
came
in
to
announce
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
beginning
to
rain
again
,
and
altogether
there
was
a
delay
,
and
a
bustle
,
and
a
talking
,
which
must
make
all
the
little
crowd
in
the
shop
understand
that
Lady
Dalrymple
was
calling
to
convey
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
At
last
Miss
Elliot
and
her
friend
,
unattended
but
by
the
servant
,
(
for
there
was
no
cousin
returned
)
,
were
walking
off
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
watching
them
,
turned
again
to
Anne
,
and
by
manner
,
rather
than
words
,
was
offering
his
services
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
"
was
her
answer
,
"
but
I
am
not
going
with
them
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
would
not
accommodate
so
many
.
<EOS>
I
walk
:
I
prefer
walking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
rains
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
very
little
,
Nothing
that
I
regard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
he
said
:
"
Though
I
came
only
yesterday
,
I
have
equipped
myself
properly
for
Bath
already
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
(
pointing
to
a
new
umbrella
)
;
"
I
wish
you
would
make
use
of
it
,
if
you
are
determined
to
walk
;
though
I
think
it
would
be
more
prudent
to
let
me
get
you
a
chair
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
was
very
much
obliged
to
him
,
but
declined
it
all
,
repeating
her
conviction
,
that
the
rain
would
come
to
nothing
at
present
,
and
adding
,
"
I
am
only
waiting
for
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
had
hardly
spoken
the
words
when
Mr
Elliot
walked
in
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
recollected
him
perfectly
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
difference
between
him
and
the
man
who
had
stood
on
the
steps
at
Lyme
,
admiring
Anne
as
she
passed
,
except
in
the
air
and
look
and
manner
of
the
privileged
relation
and
friend
.
<EOS>
He
came
in
with
eagerness
,
appeared
to
see
and
think
only
of
her
,
apologised
for
his
stay
,
was
grieved
to
have
kept
her
waiting
,
and
anxious
to
get
her
away
without
further
loss
of
time
and
before
the
rain
increased
;
and
in
another
moment
they
walked
off
together
,
her
arm
under
his
,
a
gentle
and
embarrassed
glance
,
and
a
"
Good
morning
to
you
!
"
<EOS>
being
all
that
she
had
time
for
,
as
she
passed
away
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
out
of
sight
,
the
ladies
of
Captain
Wentworth
's
party
began
talking
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Elliot
does
not
dislike
his
cousin
,
I
fancy
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
,
that
is
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
One
can
guess
what
will
happen
there
.
<EOS>
He
is
always
with
them
;
half
lives
in
the
family
,
I
believe
.
<EOS>
What
a
very
good
-
looking
man
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
and
Miss
Atkinson
,
who
dined
with
him
once
at
the
Wallises
,
says
he
is
the
most
agreeable
man
she
ever
was
in
company
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
pretty
,
I
think
;
Anne
Elliot
;
very
pretty
,
when
one
comes
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
fashion
to
say
so
,
but
I
confess
I
admire
her
more
than
her
sister
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
so
do
I.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
so
do
I.
No
comparison
.
<EOS>
But
the
men
are
all
wild
after
Miss
Elliot
.
<EOS>
Anne
is
too
delicate
for
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
would
have
been
particularly
obliged
to
her
cousin
,
if
he
would
have
walked
by
her
side
all
the
way
to
Camden
Place
,
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
found
it
so
difficult
to
listen
to
him
,
though
nothing
could
exceed
his
solicitude
and
care
,
and
though
his
subjects
were
principally
such
as
were
wo
nt
to
be
always
interesting
:
praise
,
warm
,
just
,
and
discriminating
,
of
Lady
Russell
,
and
insinuations
highly
rational
against
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
But
just
now
she
could
think
only
of
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
understand
his
present
feelings
,
whether
he
were
really
suffering
much
from
disappointment
or
not
;
and
till
that
point
were
settled
,
she
could
not
be
quite
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
hoped
to
be
wise
and
reasonable
in
time
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
she
must
confess
to
herself
that
she
was
not
wise
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Another
circumstance
very
essential
for
her
to
know
,
was
how
long
he
meant
to
be
in
Bath
;
he
had
not
mentioned
it
,
or
she
could
not
recollect
it
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
only
passing
through
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
more
probable
that
he
should
be
come
to
stay
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
so
liable
as
every
body
was
to
meet
every
body
in
Bath
,
Lady
Russell
would
in
all
likelihood
see
him
somewhere
.
<EOS>
Would
she
recollect
him
?
<EOS>
How
would
it
all
be
?
  
<EOS>
She
had
already
been
obliged
to
tell
Lady
Russell
that
Louisa
Musgrove
was
to
marry
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
It
had
cost
her
something
to
encounter
Lady
Russell
's
surprise
;
and
now
,
if
she
were
by
any
chance
to
be
thrown
into
company
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
her
imperfect
knowledge
of
the
matter
might
add
another
shade
of
prejudice
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
following
morning
Anne
was
out
with
her
friend
,
and
for
the
first
hour
,
in
an
incessant
and
fearful
sort
of
watch
for
him
in
vain
;
but
at
last
,
in
returning
down
Pulteney
Street
,
she
distinguished
him
on
the
right
hand
pavement
at
such
a
distance
as
to
have
him
in
view
the
greater
part
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
other
men
about
him
,
many
groups
walking
the
same
way
,
but
there
was
no
mistaking
him
.
<EOS>
She
looked
instinctively
at
Lady
Russell
;
but
not
from
any
mad
idea
of
her
recognising
him
so
soon
as
she
did
herself
.
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
Lady
Russell
would
perceive
him
till
they
were
nearly
opposite
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
her
however
,
from
time
to
time
,
anxiously
;
and
when
the
moment
approached
which
must
point
him
out
,
though
not
daring
to
look
again
(
for
her
own
countenance
she
knew
was
unfit
to
be
seen
)
<EOS>
,
she
was
yet
perfectly
conscious
of
Lady
Russell
's
eyes
being
turned
exactly
in
the
direction
for
him
 
of
her
being
,
in
short
,
intently
observing
him
.
<EOS>
She
could
thoroughly
comprehend
the
sort
of
fascination
he
must
possess
over
Lady
Russell
's
mind
,
the
difficulty
it
must
be
for
her
to
withdraw
her
eyes
,
the
astonishment
she
must
be
feeling
that
eight
or
nine
years
should
have
passed
over
him
,
and
in
foreign
climes
and
in
active
service
too
,
without
robbing
him
of
one
personal
grace
!
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
Lady
Russell
drew
back
her
head
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
how
would
she
speak
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
wonder
,
"
said
she
,
"
what
has
been
fixing
my
eye
so
long
;
but
I
was
looking
after
some
window
-
curtains
,
which
Lady
Alicia
and
Mrs
Frankland
were
telling
me
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
They
described
the
drawing
-
room
window
-
curtains
of
one
of
the
houses
on
this
side
of
the
way
,
and
this
part
of
the
street
,
as
being
the
handsomest
and
best
hung
of
any
in
Bath
,
but
could
not
recollect
the
exact
number
,
and
I
have
been
trying
to
find
out
which
it
could
be
;
but
I
confess
I
can
see
no
curtains
hereabouts
that
answer
their
description
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
sighed
and
blushed
and
smiled
,
in
pity
and
disdain
,
either
at
her
friend
or
herself
.
<EOS>
The
part
which
provoked
her
most
,
was
that
in
all
this
waste
of
foresight
and
caution
,
she
should
have
lost
the
right
moment
for
seeing
whether
he
saw
them
.
  
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
passed
without
producing
anything
.
<EOS>
The
theatre
or
the
rooms
,
where
he
was
most
likely
to
be
,
were
not
fashionable
enough
for
the
Elliots
,
whose
evening
amusements
were
solely
in
the
elegant
stupidity
of
private
parties
,
in
which
they
were
getting
more
and
more
engaged
;
and
Anne
,
wearied
of
such
a
state
of
stagnation
,
sick
of
knowing
nothing
,
and
fancying
herself
stronger
because
her
strength
was
not
tried
,
was
quite
impatient
for
the
concert
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
concert
for
the
benefit
of
a
person
patronised
by
Lady
Dalrymple
.
<EOS>
Of
course
they
must
attend
.
<EOS>
It
was
really
expected
to
be
a
good
one
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
was
very
fond
of
music
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
only
have
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
him
again
,
she
fancied
she
should
be
satisfied
;
and
as
to
the
power
of
addressing
him
,
she
felt
all
over
courage
if
the
opportunity
occurred
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
had
turned
from
him
,
Lady
Russell
overlooked
him
;
her
nerves
were
strengthened
by
these
circumstances
;
she
felt
that
she
owed
him
attention
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
once
partly
promised
Mrs
Smith
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
;
but
in
a
short
hurried
call
she
excused
herself
and
put
it
off
,
with
the
more
decided
promise
of
a
longer
visit
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
gave
a
most
good
-
humoured
acquiescence
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
"
said
she
;
"
only
tell
me
all
about
it
,
when
you
do
come
.
<EOS>
Who
is
your
party
?
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
named
them
all
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
made
no
reply
;
but
when
she
was
leaving
her
said
,
and
with
an
expression
half
serious
,
half
arch
,
"
Well
,
I
heartily
wish
your
concert
may
answer
;
and
do
not
fail
me
to
-
morrow
if
you
can
come
;
for
I
begin
to
have
a
foreboding
that
I
may
not
have
many
more
visits
from
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
startled
and
confused
;
but
after
standing
in
a
moment
's
suspense
,
was
obliged
,
and
not
sorry
to
be
obliged
,
to
hurry
away
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
his
two
daughters
,
and
Mrs
Clay
,
were
the
earliest
of
all
their
party
at
the
rooms
in
the
evening
;
and
as
Lady
Dalrymple
must
be
waited
for
,
they
took
their
station
by
one
of
the
fires
in
the
Octagon
Room
.
<EOS>
But
hardly
were
they
so
settled
,
when
the
door
opened
again
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
walked
in
alone
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
the
nearest
to
him
,
and
making
yet
a
little
advance
,
she
instantly
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
was
preparing
only
to
bow
and
pass
on
,
but
her
gentle
"
How
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
"
brought
him
out
of
the
straight
line
to
stand
near
her
,
and
make
enquiries
in
return
,
in
spite
of
the
formidable
father
and
sister
in
the
back
ground
.
<EOS>
Their
being
in
the
back
ground
was
a
support
to
Anne
;
she
knew
nothing
of
their
looks
,
and
felt
equal
to
everything
which
she
believed
right
to
be
done
.
  
<EOS>
While
they
were
speaking
,
a
whispering
between
her
father
and
Elizabeth
caught
her
ear
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
distinguish
,
but
she
must
guess
the
subject
;
and
on
Captain
Wentworth
's
making
a
distant
bow
<EOS>
,
she
comprehended
that
her
father
had
judged
so
well
as
to
give
him
that
simple
acknowledgement
of
acquaintance
,
and
she
was
just
in
time
by
a
side
glance
to
see
a
slight
curtsey
from
Elizabeth
herself
.
<EOS>
This
,
though
late
,
and
reluctant
,
and
ungracious
,
was
yet
better
than
nothing
,
and
her
spirits
improved
.
  
<EOS>
After
talking
,
however
,
of
the
weather
,
and
Bath
,
and
the
concert
,
their
conversation
began
to
flag
,
and
so
little
was
said
at
last
,
that
she
was
expecting
him
to
go
every
moment
,
but
he
did
not
<EOS>
;
he
seemed
in
no
hurry
to
leave
her
;
and
presently
with
renewed
spirit
,
with
a
little
smile
,
a
little
glow
,
he
said
    
"
I
have
hardly
seen
you
since
our
day
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
you
must
have
suffered
from
the
shock
,
and
the
more
from
its
not
overpowering
you
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
assured
him
that
she
had
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
frightful
hour
,
"
said
he
,
"
a
frightful
day
!
"
<EOS>
and
he
passed
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
as
if
the
remembrance
were
still
too
painful
,
but
in
a
moment
,
half
smiling
again
,
added
,
"
The
day
has
produced
some
effects
however
;
has
had
some
consequences
which
must
be
considered
as
the
very
reverse
of
frightful
.
<EOS>
When
you
had
the
presence
of
mind
to
suggest
that
Benwick
would
be
the
properest
person
to
fetch
a
surgeon
,
you
could
have
little
idea
of
his
being
eventually
one
of
those
most
concerned
in
her
recovery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
I
could
have
none
.
<EOS>
But
it
appears
 
I
should
hope
it
would
be
a
very
happy
match
.
<EOS>
There
are
on
both
sides
good
principles
and
good
temper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
,
looking
not
exactly
forward
;
"
but
there
,
I
think
,
ends
the
resemblance
.
<EOS>
With
all
my
soul
I
wish
them
happy
,
and
rejoice
over
every
circumstance
in
favour
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
difficulties
to
contend
with
at
home
,
no
opposition
,
no
caprice
,
no
delays
.
<EOS>
The
Musgroves
are
behaving
like
themselves
,
most
honourably
and
kindly
,
only
anxious
with
true
parental
hearts
to
promote
their
daughter
's
comfort
.
<EOS>
All
this
is
much
,
very
much
in
favour
of
their
happiness
;
more
than
perhaps
 
"
  
He
stopped
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
recollection
seemed
to
occur
,
and
to
give
him
some
taste
of
that
emotion
which
was
reddening
Anne
's
cheeks
and
fixing
her
eyes
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
After
clearing
his
throat
,
however
,
he
proceeded
thus
    
<EOS>
"
I
confess
that
I
do
think
there
is
a
disparity
,
too
great
a
disparity
,
and
in
a
point
no
less
essential
than
mind
.
<EOS>
I
regard
Louisa
Musgrove
as
a
very
amiable
,
sweet
-
tempered
girl
,
and
not
deficient
in
understanding
,
but
Benwick
is
something
more
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
clever
man
,
a
reading
man
;
and
I
confess
,
that
I
do
consider
his
attaching
himself
to
her
with
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
the
effect
of
gratitude
,
<EOS>
had
he
learnt
to
love
her
,
because
he
believed
her
to
be
preferring
him
,
it
would
have
been
another
thing
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
reason
to
suppose
it
so
.
<EOS>
It
seems
,
on
the
contrary
,
to
have
been
a
perfectly
spontaneous
,
untaught
feeling
on
his
side
,
and
this
surprises
me
.
<EOS>
A
man
like
him
,
in
his
situation
!
<EOS>
with
a
heart
pierced
,
wounded
,
<EOS>
almost
broken
!
<EOS>
Fanny
Harville
was
a
very
superior
creature
,
and
his
attachment
to
her
was
indeed
attachment
.
<EOS>
A
man
does
not
recover
from
such
a
devotion
of
the
heart
to
such
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
ought
not
;
he
does
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
Either
from
the
consciousness
,
however
,
that
his
friend
had
recovered
,
or
from
other
consciousness
,
he
went
no
farther
;
and
Anne
who
,
in
spite
of
the
agitated
voice
in
which
the
latter
part
had
been
uttered
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
various
noises
of
the
room
,
the
almost
ceaseless
slam
of
the
door
,
and
ceaseless
buzz
of
persons
walking
through
,
had
distinguished
every
word
,
was
struck
,
gratified
,
confused
,
and
beginning
to
breathe
very
quick
,
and
feel
an
hundred
things
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
enter
on
such
a
subject
;
and
yet
,
after
a
pause
,
feeling
the
necessity
of
speaking
,
and
having
not
the
smallest
wish
for
a
total
change
<EOS>
,
she
only
deviated
so
far
as
to
say
    
<EOS>
"
You
were
a
good
while
at
Lyme
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
leave
it
till
Louisa
's
doing
well
was
quite
ascertained
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
too
deeply
concerned
in
the
mischief
to
be
soon
at
peace
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
my
doing
,
solely
mine
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
have
been
obstinate
if
I
had
not
been
weak
.
<EOS>
The
country
round
Lyme
is
very
fine
.
<EOS>
I
walked
and
rode
a
great
deal
;
and
the
more
I
saw
,
the
more
I
found
to
admire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
very
much
like
to
see
Lyme
again
,
"
said
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
!
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
supposed
that
you
could
have
found
anything
in
Lyme
to
inspire
such
a
feeling
.
<EOS>
The
horror
and
distress
you
were
involved
in
,
the
stretch
of
mind
,
the
wear
of
spirits
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
your
last
impressions
of
Lyme
must
have
been
strong
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
last
hours
were
certainly
very
painful
,
"
replied
Anne
;
"
but
when
pain
is
over
,
the
remembrance
of
it
often
becomes
a
pleasure
.
<EOS>
One
does
not
love
a
place
the
less
for
having
suffered
in
it
,
unless
it
has
been
all
suffering
,
nothing
but
suffering
,
which
was
by
no
means
the
case
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
We
were
only
in
anxiety
and
distress
during
the
last
two
hours
,
and
previously
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
So
much
novelty
and
beauty
!
<EOS>
I
have
travelled
so
little
,
that
every
fresh
place
would
be
interesting
to
me
;
but
there
is
real
beauty
at
Lyme
;
and
in
short
"
(
with
a
faint
blush
at
some
recollections
)
,
"
altogether
my
impressions
of
the
place
are
very
agreeable
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
ceased
,
the
entrance
door
opened
again
,
and
the
very
party
appeared
for
whom
they
were
waiting
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
,
Lady
Dalrymple
,
"
was
the
rejoicing
sound
;
and
with
all
the
eagerness
compatible
with
anxious
elegance
,
Sir
Walter
and
his
two
ladies
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
,
escorted
by
Mr
Elliot
and
Colonel
Wallis
,
who
had
happened
to
arrive
nearly
at
the
same
instant
,
advanced
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
others
joined
them
,
and
it
was
a
group
in
which
Anne
found
herself
also
necessarily
included
.
<EOS>
She
was
divided
from
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
Their
interesting
,
almost
too
interesting
conversation
must
be
broken
up
for
a
time
,
but
slight
was
the
penance
compared
with
the
happiness
which
brought
it
on
!
<EOS>
She
had
learnt
,
in
the
last
ten
minutes
,
more
of
his
feelings
towards
Louisa
,
more
of
all
his
feelings
than
she
dared
to
think
of
;
and
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
demands
of
the
party
,
to
the
needful
civilities
of
the
moment
,
with
exquisite
,
though
agitated
sensations
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
good
humour
with
all
.
<EOS>
She
had
received
ideas
which
disposed
her
to
be
courteous
and
kind
to
all
,
and
to
pity
every
one
,
as
being
less
happy
than
herself
.
  
<EOS>
The
delightful
emotions
were
a
little
subdued
,
when
on
stepping
back
from
the
group
,
to
be
joined
again
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
she
saw
that
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
in
time
to
see
him
turn
into
the
Concert
Room
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
;
he
had
disappeared
,
she
felt
a
moment
's
regret
.
<EOS>
But
"
they
should
meet
again
.
<EOS>
He
would
look
for
her
,
he
would
find
her
out
before
the
evening
were
over
,
and
at
present
,
perhaps
,
it
was
as
well
to
be
asunder
.
<EOS>
She
was
in
need
of
a
little
interval
for
recollection
.
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
Lady
Russell
's
appearance
soon
afterwards
,
the
whole
party
was
collected
,
and
all
that
remained
was
to
marshal
themselves
,
and
proceed
into
the
Concert
Room
;
and
be
of
all
the
consequence
in
their
power
,
draw
as
many
eyes
,
excite
as
many
whispers
,
and
disturb
as
many
people
as
they
could
.
  
<EOS>
Very
,
very
happy
were
both
Elizabeth
and
Anne
Elliot
as
they
walked
in
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
arm
in
arm
with
Miss
Carteret
,
and
looking
on
the
broad
back
of
the
dowager
Viscountess
Dalrymple
before
her
,
had
nothing
to
wish
for
which
did
not
seem
within
her
reach
;
and
Anne
 
<EOS>
but
it
would
be
an
insult
to
the
nature
of
Anne
's
felicity
,
to
draw
any
comparison
between
it
and
her
sister
's
;
the
origin
of
one
all
selfish
vanity
,
of
the
other
all
generous
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
saw
nothing
,
thought
nothing
of
the
brilliancy
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Her
happiness
was
from
within
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
bright
and
her
cheeks
glowed
;
but
she
knew
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
thinking
only
of
the
last
half
hour
,
and
as
they
passed
to
their
seats
,
her
mind
took
a
hasty
range
over
it
.
<EOS>
His
choice
of
subjects
,
his
expressions
,
and
still
more
his
manner
and
look
,
had
been
such
as
she
could
see
in
only
one
light
.
<EOS>
His
opinion
of
Louisa
Musgrove
's
inferiority
,
an
opinion
which
he
had
seemed
solicitous
to
give
,
his
wonder
at
Captain
Benwick
,
his
feelings
as
to
a
first
,
strong
attachment
;
sentences
begun
which
he
could
not
finish
,
his
half
averted
eyes
and
more
than
half
expressive
glance
,
all
,
all
declared
that
he
had
a
heart
returning
to
her
at
least
;
that
anger
,
resentment
,
avoidance
,
were
no
more
;
and
that
they
were
succeeded
,
not
merely
by
friendship
and
regard
,
but
by
the
tenderness
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
some
share
of
the
tenderness
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
contemplate
the
change
as
implying
less
.
<EOS>
He
must
love
her
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
thoughts
,
with
their
attendant
visions
,
which
occupied
and
flurried
her
too
much
to
leave
her
any
power
of
observation
;
and
she
passed
along
the
room
without
having
a
glimpse
of
him
,
without
even
trying
to
discern
him
.
<EOS>
When
their
places
were
determined
on
,
and
they
were
all
properly
arranged
,
she
looked
round
to
see
if
he
should
happen
to
be
in
the
same
part
of
the
room
,
but
he
was
not
;
her
eye
could
not
reach
him
;
and
the
concert
being
just
opening
,
she
must
consent
for
a
time
to
be
happy
in
a
humbler
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
was
divided
and
disposed
of
on
two
contiguous
benches
:
Anne
was
among
those
on
the
foremost
,
and
Mr
Elliot
had
manoeuvred
so
well
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
friend
Colonel
Wallis
,
as
to
have
a
seat
by
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Elliot
,
surrounded
by
her
cousins
,
and
the
principal
object
of
Colonel
Wallis
's
gallantry
,
was
quite
contented
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
mind
was
in
a
most
favourable
state
for
the
entertainment
of
the
evening
;
it
was
just
occupation
enough
:
she
had
feelings
for
the
tender
,
spirits
for
the
gay
,
attention
for
the
scientific
,
and
patience
for
the
wearisome
;
and
had
never
liked
a
concert
better
,
at
least
during
the
first
act
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
close
of
it
,
in
the
interval
succeeding
an
Italian
song
,
she
explained
the
words
of
the
song
to
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
They
had
a
concert
bill
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
,
"
said
she
,
"
is
nearly
the
sense
,
or
rather
the
meaning
of
the
words
,
for
certainly
the
sense
of
an
Italian
love
-
song
must
not
be
talked
of
,
but
it
is
as
nearly
the
meaning
as
I
can
give
;
for
I
do
not
pretend
to
understand
the
language
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
very
poor
Italian
scholar
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
see
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
see
you
know
nothing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
knowledge
enough
of
the
language
to
translate
at
sight
<EOS>
these
inverted
,
transposed
,
curtailed
Italian
lines
,
into
clear
,
comprehensible
,
elegant
English
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
say
anything
more
of
your
ignorance
.
<EOS>
Here
is
complete
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
oppose
such
kind
politeness
;
but
I
should
be
sorry
to
be
examined
by
a
real
proficient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
had
the
pleasure
of
visiting
in
Camden
Place
so
long
,
"
replied
he
,
"
without
knowing
something
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot
;
and
I
do
regard
her
as
one
who
is
too
modest
for
the
world
in
general
to
be
aware
of
half
her
accomplishments
,
and
too
highly
accomplished
for
modesty
to
be
natural
in
any
other
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
For
shame
!
<EOS>
for
shame
!
<EOS>
this
is
too
much
flattery
.
<EOS>
I
forget
what
we
are
to
have
next
,
"
turning
to
the
bill
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
said
Mr
Elliot
,
speaking
low
,
"
I
have
had
a
longer
acquaintance
with
your
character
than
you
are
aware
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
How
so
?
<EOS>
You
can
have
been
acquainted
with
it
only
since
I
came
to
Bath
,
excepting
as
you
might
hear
me
previously
spoken
of
in
my
own
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
by
report
long
before
you
came
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
I
had
heard
you
described
by
those
who
knew
you
intimately
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
acquainted
with
you
by
character
many
years
.
<EOS>
Your
person
,
your
disposition
,
accomplishments
,
manner
;
they
were
all
present
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
not
disappointed
in
the
interest
he
hoped
to
raise
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
withstand
the
charm
of
such
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
To
have
been
described
long
ago
to
a
recent
acquaintance
,
by
nameless
people
,
is
irresistible
;
and
Anne
was
all
curiosity
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
,
and
questioned
him
eagerly
;
but
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
delighted
in
being
asked
,
but
he
would
not
tell
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
some
time
or
other
,
perhaps
,
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
mention
no
names
now
;
but
such
,
he
could
assure
her
,
had
been
the
fact
.
<EOS>
He
had
many
years
ago
received
such
a
description
of
Miss
Anne
Elliot
as
had
inspired
him
with
the
highest
idea
of
her
merit
,
and
excited
the
warmest
curiosity
to
know
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
think
of
no
one
so
likely
to
have
spoken
with
partiality
of
her
many
years
ago
as
the
Mr
Wentworth
of
Monkford
,
Captain
Wentworth
's
brother
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
in
Mr
Elliot
's
company
,
but
she
had
not
courage
to
ask
the
question
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
name
of
Anne
Elliot
,
"
said
he
,
"
has
long
had
an
interesting
sound
to
me
.
<EOS>
Very
long
has
it
possessed
a
charm
over
my
fancy
;
and
,
if
I
dared
,
I
would
breathe
my
wishes
that
the
name
might
never
change
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Such
,
she
believed
,
were
his
words
;
but
scarcely
had
she
received
their
sound
,
than
her
attention
was
caught
by
other
sounds
immediately
behind
her
,
which
rendered
every
thing
else
trivial
.
<EOS>
Her
father
and
Lady
Dalrymple
were
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
well
-
looking
man
,
"
said
Sir
Walter
,
"
a
very
well
-
looking
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
fine
young
man
indeed
!
"
said
Lady
Dalrymple
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
More
air
than
one
often
sees
in
Bath
.
<EOS>
Irish
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
just
know
his
name
.
<EOS>
A
bowing
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Wentworth
;
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
of
the
navy
.
<EOS>
His
sister
married
my
tenant
in
Somersetshire
,
the
Croft
,
who
rents
Kellynch
.
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Sir
Walter
had
reached
this
point
,
Anne
's
eyes
had
caught
the
right
direction
,
and
distinguished
Captain
Wentworth
standing
among
a
cluster
of
men
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
As
her
eyes
fell
on
him
,
his
seemed
to
be
withdrawn
from
her
.
<EOS>
It
had
that
appearance
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
she
had
been
one
moment
too
late
;
and
as
long
as
she
dared
observe
,
he
did
not
look
again
:
but
the
performance
was
recommencing
,
and
she
was
forced
to
seem
to
restore
her
attention
to
the
orchestra
and
look
straight
forward
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
could
give
another
glance
,
he
had
moved
away
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
come
nearer
to
her
if
he
would
;
she
was
so
surrounded
and
shut
in
:
but
she
would
rather
have
caught
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
's
speech
,
too
,
distressed
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
longer
any
inclination
to
talk
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
wished
him
not
so
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
act
was
over
.
<EOS>
Now
she
hoped
for
some
beneficial
change
;
and
,
after
a
period
of
nothing
-
saying
amongst
the
party
,
some
of
them
did
decide
on
going
in
quest
of
tea
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
one
of
the
few
who
did
not
choose
to
move
.
<EOS>
She
remained
in
her
seat
,
and
so
did
Lady
Russell
;
but
she
had
the
pleasure
of
getting
rid
of
Mr
Elliot
;
and
she
did
not
mean
,
whatever
she
might
feel
on
Lady
Russell
's
account
,
to
shrink
from
conversation
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
if
he
gave
her
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
She
was
persuaded
by
Lady
Russell
's
countenance
that
she
had
seen
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
come
however
.
<EOS>
Anne
sometimes
fancied
she
discerned
him
at
a
distance
,
but
he
never
came
.
<EOS>
The
anxious
interval
wore
away
unproductively
.
<EOS>
The
others
returned
,
the
room
filled
again
,
benches
were
reclaimed
and
repossessed
,
and
another
hour
of
pleasure
or
of
penance
was
to
be
sat
out
,
<EOS>
another
hour
of
music
was
to
give
delight
or
the
gapes
,
as
real
or
affected
taste
for
it
prevailed
.
<EOS>
To
Anne
,
it
chiefly
wore
the
prospect
of
an
hour
of
agitation
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
quit
that
room
in
peace
without
seeing
Captain
Wentworth
once
more
,
without
the
interchange
of
one
friendly
look
.
  
<EOS>
In
re
-
settling
themselves
there
were
now
many
changes
,
the
result
of
which
was
favourable
for
her
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Wallis
declined
sitting
down
again
,
and
Mr
Elliot
was
invited
by
Elizabeth
and
Miss
Carteret
,
in
a
manner
not
to
be
refused
,
to
sit
between
them
;
and
by
some
other
removals
,
and
a
little
scheming
of
her
own
,
Anne
was
enabled
to
place
herself
much
nearer
the
end
of
the
bench
than
she
had
been
before
,
much
more
within
reach
of
a
passer
-
by
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
do
so
,
without
comparing
herself
with
Miss
Larolles
,
the
inimitable
Miss
Larolles
;
but
still
she
did
it
,
and
not
with
much
happier
effect
;
though
by
what
seemed
prosperity
in
the
shape
of
an
early
abdication
in
her
next
neighbours
,
she
found
herself
at
the
very
end
of
the
bench
before
the
concert
closed
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
her
situation
,
with
a
vacant
space
at
hand
,
when
Captain
Wentworth
was
again
in
sight
.
<EOS>
She
saw
him
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
too
;
yet
he
looked
grave
,
and
seemed
irresolute
,
and
only
by
very
slow
degrees
came
at
last
near
enough
to
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
something
must
be
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
change
was
indubitable
.
<EOS>
The
difference
between
his
present
air
and
what
it
had
been
in
the
Octagon
Room
was
strikingly
great
.
<EOS>
Why
was
it
?
<EOS>
She
thought
of
her
father
,
of
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
Could
there
have
been
any
unpleasant
glances
?
<EOS>
He
began
by
speaking
of
the
concert
gravely
,
more
like
the
Captain
Wentworth
of
Uppercross
;
owned
himself
disappointed
,
had
expected
singing
;
and
in
short
,
must
confess
that
he
should
not
be
sorry
when
it
was
over
.
<EOS>
Anne
replied
,
and
spoke
in
defence
of
the
performance
so
well
,
and
yet
in
allowance
for
his
feelings
so
pleasantly
,
that
his
countenance
improved
,
and
he
replied
again
with
almost
a
smile
.
<EOS>
They
talked
for
a
few
minutes
more
;
the
improvement
held
;
he
even
looked
down
towards
the
bench
,
as
if
he
saw
a
place
on
it
well
worth
occupying
;
when
at
that
moment
a
touch
on
her
shoulder
obliged
Anne
to
turn
round
.
<EOS>
It
came
from
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
He
begged
her
pardon
,
but
she
must
be
applied
to
,
to
explain
Italian
again
.
<EOS>
Miss
Carteret
was
very
anxious
to
have
a
general
idea
of
what
was
next
to
be
sung
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
refuse
;
but
never
had
she
sacrificed
to
politeness
with
a
more
suffering
spirit
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
,
though
as
few
as
possible
,
were
inevitably
consumed
;
and
when
her
own
mistress
again
,
when
able
to
turn
and
look
as
she
had
done
before
,
she
found
herself
accosted
by
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
a
reserved
yet
hurried
sort
of
farewell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
must
wish
her
good
night
;
he
was
going
;
he
should
get
home
as
fast
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Is
not
this
song
worth
staying
for
?
"
said
Anne
,
suddenly
struck
by
an
idea
which
made
her
yet
more
anxious
to
be
encouraging
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
<EOS>
he
replied
impressively
,
"
there
is
nothing
worth
my
staying
for
;
"
and
he
was
gone
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Jealousy
of
Mr
Elliot
!
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
intelligible
motive
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
jealous
of
her
affection
!
<EOS>
Could
she
have
believed
it
a
week
ago
;
three
hours
ago
!
<EOS>
For
a
moment
the
gratification
was
exquisite
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
there
were
very
different
thoughts
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
How
was
such
jealousy
to
be
quieted
?
<EOS>
How
was
the
truth
to
reach
him
?
<EOS>
How
,
in
all
the
peculiar
disadvantages
of
their
respective
situations
,
would
he
ever
learn
of
her
real
sentiments
?
<EOS>
It
was
misery
to
think
of
Mr
Elliot
's
attentions
.
<EOS>
Their
evil
was
incalculable
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
recollected
with
pleasure
the
next
morning
her
promise
of
going
to
Mrs
Smith
,
meaning
that
it
should
engage
her
from
home
at
the
time
when
Mr
Elliot
would
be
most
likely
to
call
;
for
to
avoid
Mr
Elliot
was
almost
a
first
object
.
  
<EOS>
She
felt
a
great
deal
of
good
-
will
towards
him
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
mischief
of
his
attentions
,
she
owed
him
gratitude
and
regard
,
perhaps
compassion
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
help
thinking
much
of
the
extraordinary
circumstances
attending
their
acquaintance
,
of
the
right
which
he
seemed
to
have
to
interest
her
,
by
everything
in
situation
,
by
his
own
sentiments
,
by
his
early
prepossession
.
<EOS>
It
was
altogether
very
extraordinary
;
flattering
,
but
painful
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
to
regret
.
<EOS>
How
she
might
have
felt
had
there
been
no
Captain
Wentworth
in
the
case
,
was
not
worth
enquiry
;
for
there
was
a
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
be
the
conclusion
of
the
present
suspense
good
or
bad
,
her
affection
would
be
his
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Their
union
,
she
believed
,
could
not
divide
her
more
from
other
men
,
than
their
final
separation
.
  
<EOS>
Prettier
musings
of
high
-
wrought
love
and
eternal
constancy
,
could
never
have
passed
along
the
streets
of
Bath
,
than
Anne
was
sporting
with
from
Camden
Place
to
Westgate
Buildings
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
enough
to
spread
purification
and
perfume
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
sure
of
a
pleasant
reception
;
and
her
friend
seemed
this
morning
particularly
obliged
to
her
for
coming
,
seemed
hardly
to
have
expected
her
,
though
it
had
been
an
appointment
.
  
<EOS>
An
account
of
the
concert
was
immediately
claimed
;
and
Anne
's
recollections
of
the
concert
were
quite
happy
enough
to
animate
her
features
and
make
her
rejoice
to
talk
of
it
.
<EOS>
All
that
she
could
tell
she
told
most
gladly
,
but
the
all
was
little
for
one
who
had
been
there
,
and
unsatisfactory
for
such
an
enquirer
as
Mrs
Smith
,
who
had
already
heard
,
through
the
short
cut
of
a
laundress
and
a
waiter
,
rather
more
of
the
general
success
and
produce
of
the
evening
than
Anne
could
relate
,
and
who
now
asked
in
vain
for
several
particulars
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Everybody
of
any
consequence
or
notoriety
in
Bath
was
well
know
by
name
to
Mrs
Smith
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
little
Durands
were
there
,
I
conclude
,
"
said
she
,
"
with
their
mouths
open
to
catch
the
music
,
like
unfledged
sparrows
ready
to
be
fed
.
<EOS>
They
never
miss
a
concert
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
did
not
see
them
myself
,
but
I
heard
Mr
Elliot
say
they
were
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Ibbotsons
,
were
they
there
?
<EOS>
and
the
two
new
beauties
,
with
the
tall
Irish
officer
,
who
is
talked
of
for
one
of
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
know
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
they
were
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Old
Lady
Mary
Maclean
?
<EOS>
I
need
not
ask
after
her
.
<EOS>
She
never
misses
,
I
know
;
and
you
must
have
seen
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
been
in
your
own
circle
;
for
as
you
went
with
Lady
Dalrymple
,
you
were
in
the
seats
of
grandeur
,
round
the
orchestra
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
was
what
I
dreaded
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
very
unpleasant
to
me
in
every
respect
.
<EOS>
But
happily
Lady
Dalrymple
always
chooses
to
be
farther
off
;
and
we
were
exceedingly
well
placed
,
that
is
,
for
hearing
;
I
must
not
say
for
seeing
,
because
I
appear
to
have
seen
very
little
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
you
saw
enough
for
your
own
amusement
.
<EOS>
I
can
understand
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
sort
of
domestic
enjoyment
to
be
known
even
in
a
crowd
,
and
this
you
had
.
<EOS>
You
were
a
large
party
in
yourselves
,
and
you
wanted
nothing
beyond
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ought
to
have
looked
about
me
more
,
"
said
Anne
,
conscious
while
she
spoke
that
there
had
in
fact
been
no
want
of
looking
about
,
that
the
object
only
had
been
deficient
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
you
were
better
employed
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
tell
me
that
you
had
a
pleasant
evening
.
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
your
eye
.
<EOS>
I
perfectly
see
how
the
hours
passed
:
that
you
had
always
something
agreeable
to
listen
to
.
<EOS>
In
the
intervals
of
the
concert
it
was
conversation
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
half
smiled
and
said
,
"
Do
you
see
that
in
my
eye
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
do
.
<EOS>
Your
countenance
perfectly
informs
me
that
you
were
in
company
last
night
with
the
person
whom
you
think
the
most
agreeable
in
the
world
,
the
person
who
interests
you
at
this
present
time
more
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
put
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
blush
overspread
Anne
's
cheeks
.
<EOS>
She
could
say
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
such
being
the
case
<EOS>
,
"
continued
Mrs
Smith
,
after
a
short
pause
,
"
I
hope
you
believe
that
I
do
know
how
to
value
your
kindness
in
coming
to
me
this
morning
.
<EOS>
It
is
really
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
sit
with
me
,
when
you
must
have
so
many
pleasanter
demands
upon
your
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
heard
nothing
of
this
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
in
the
astonishment
and
confusion
excited
by
her
friend
's
penetration
,
unable
to
imagine
how
any
report
of
Captain
Wentworth
could
have
reached
her
.
<EOS>
After
another
short
silence
    
"
Pray
,
"
said
Mrs
Smith
,
"
is
Mr
Elliot
aware
of
your
acquaintance
with
me
?
<EOS>
Does
he
know
that
I
am
in
Bath
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Elliot
!
"
repeated
Anne
,
looking
up
surprised
.
<EOS>
A
moment
's
reflection
shewed
her
the
mistake
she
had
been
under
.
<EOS>
She
caught
it
instantaneously
;
and
recovering
her
courage
with
the
feeling
of
safety
,
soon
added
,
more
composedly
,
"
Are
you
acquainted
with
Mr
Elliot
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
a
good
deal
acquainted
with
him
,
"
replied
Mrs
Smith
,
gravely
,
"
but
it
seems
worn
out
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
great
while
since
we
met
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
at
all
aware
of
this
.
<EOS>
You
never
mentioned
it
before
.
<EOS>
Had
I
known
it
<EOS>
,
I
would
have
had
the
pleasure
of
talking
to
him
about
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
confess
the
truth
,
"
said
Mrs
Smith
,
assuming
her
usual
air
of
cheerfulness
,
"
that
is
exactly
the
pleasure
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
to
talk
about
me
to
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
I
want
your
interest
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
can
be
of
essential
service
to
me
;
and
if
you
would
have
the
goodness
,
my
dear
Miss
Elliot
,
to
make
it
an
object
to
yourself
,
of
course
it
is
done
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
extremely
happy
;
I
hope
you
can
not
doubt
my
willingness
to
be
of
even
the
slightest
use
to
you
,
"
replied
Anne
;
"
but
I
suspect
that
you
are
considering
me
as
having
a
higher
claim
on
Mr
Elliot
,
a
greater
right
to
influence
him
,
than
is
really
the
case
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
have
,
somehow
or
other
,
imbibed
such
a
notion
.
<EOS>
You
must
consider
me
only
as
Mr
Elliot
's
relation
.
<EOS>
If
in
that
light
there
is
anything
which
you
suppose
his
cousin
might
fairly
ask
of
him
,
I
beg
you
would
not
hesitate
to
employ
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
gave
her
a
penetrating
glance
,
and
then
,
smiling
,
said
    
"
I
have
been
a
little
premature
<EOS>
,
I
perceive
;
I
beg
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
waited
for
official
information
,
But
now
,
my
dear
Miss
Elliot
,
as
an
old
friend
,
do
give
me
a
hint
as
to
when
I
may
speak
.
<EOS>
Next
week
?
<EOS>
To
be
sure
by
next
week
I
may
be
allowed
to
think
it
all
settled
,
and
build
my
own
selfish
schemes
on
Mr
Elliot
's
good
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Anne
,
"
nor
next
week
,
nor
next
,
nor
next
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
that
nothing
of
the
sort
you
are
thinking
of
will
be
settled
any
week
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
going
to
marry
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
why
you
imagine
I
am
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
looked
at
her
again
,
looked
earnestly
,
smiled
,
shook
her
head
,
and
exclaimed
    
"
Now
,
how
I
do
wish
I
understood
you
!
<EOS>
How
I
do
wish
I
knew
what
you
were
at
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
idea
that
you
do
not
design
to
be
cruel
,
when
the
right
moment
occurs
.
<EOS>
Till
it
does
come
,
you
know
,
we
women
never
mean
to
have
anybody
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
thing
of
course
among
us
,
that
every
man
is
refused
,
till
he
offers
.
<EOS>
But
why
should
you
be
cruel
?
<EOS>
Let
me
plead
for
my
 
present
friend
<EOS>
I
can
not
call
him
,
but
for
my
former
friend
.
<EOS>
Where
can
you
look
for
a
more
suitable
match
?
<EOS>
Where
could
you
expect
a
more
gentlemanlike
,
agreeable
man
?
<EOS>
Let
me
recommend
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
hear
nothing
but
good
of
him
from
Colonel
Wallis
;
and
who
can
know
him
better
than
Colonel
Wallis
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs
Smith
,
Mr
Elliot
's
wife
has
not
been
dead
much
above
half
a
year
.
<EOS>
He
ought
not
to
be
supposed
to
be
paying
his
addresses
to
any
one
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
these
are
your
only
objections
,
"
cried
Mrs
Smith
,
archly
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
is
safe
,
and
I
shall
give
myself
no
more
trouble
about
him
.
<EOS>
Do
not
forget
me
when
you
are
married
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Let
him
know
me
to
be
a
friend
of
yours
,
and
then
he
will
think
little
of
the
trouble
required
,
which
it
is
very
natural
for
him
now
,
with
so
many
affairs
and
engagements
of
his
own
,
to
avoid
and
get
rid
of
as
he
can
;
very
natural
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
Ninety
-
nine
out
of
a
hundred
would
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
can
not
be
aware
of
the
importance
to
me
.
<EOS>
Well
,
my
dear
Miss
Elliot
,
I
hope
and
trust
<EOS>
you
will
be
very
happy
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
has
sense
to
understand
the
value
of
such
a
woman
.
<EOS>
Your
peace
will
not
be
shipwrecked
as
mine
has
been
.
<EOS>
You
are
safe
in
all
worldly
matters
,
and
safe
in
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
will
not
be
led
astray
;
he
will
not
be
misled
by
others
to
his
ruin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
I
can
readily
believe
all
that
of
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
have
a
calm
decided
temper
,
not
at
all
open
to
dangerous
impressions
.
<EOS>
I
consider
him
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
,
from
any
thing
that
has
fallen
within
my
observation
,
to
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
known
him
long
;
and
he
is
not
a
man
,
I
think
,
to
be
known
intimately
soon
.
<EOS>
Will
not
this
manner
of
speaking
of
him
,
Mrs
Smith
,
convince
you
that
he
is
nothing
to
me
?
<EOS>
Surely
this
must
be
calm
enough
.
<EOS>
And
,
upon
my
word
,
he
is
nothing
to
me
.
<EOS>
Should
he
ever
propose
to
me
(
which
I
have
very
little
reason
to
imagine
he
has
any
thought
of
doing
)
,
I
shall
not
accept
him
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
I
shall
not
.
<EOS>
I
assure
you
,
Mr
Elliot
had
not
the
share
which
you
have
been
supposing
,
in
whatever
pleasure
the
concert
of
last
night
might
afford
:
not
Mr
Elliot
;
it
is
not
Mr
Elliot
that
 
"
  
She
stopped
,
regretting
with
a
deep
blush
that
she
had
implied
so
much
;
but
less
would
hardly
have
been
sufficient
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
would
hardly
have
believed
so
soon
in
Mr
Elliot
's
failure
,
but
from
the
perception
of
there
being
a
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
instantly
submitted
,
and
with
all
the
semblance
of
seeing
nothing
beyond
;
and
Anne
,
eager
to
escape
farther
notice
,
was
impatient
to
know
why
Mrs
Smith
should
have
fancied
she
was
to
marry
Mr
Elliot
;
where
she
could
have
received
the
idea
,
or
from
whom
she
could
have
heard
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
tell
me
how
it
first
came
into
your
head
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
first
came
into
my
head
,
"
replied
Mrs
Smith
,
"
upon
finding
how
much
you
were
together
,
and
feeling
it
to
be
the
most
probable
thing
in
the
world
to
be
wished
for
by
everybody
belonging
to
either
of
you
;
and
you
may
depend
upon
it
that
all
your
acquaintance
have
disposed
of
you
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
heard
it
spoken
of
till
two
days
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
has
it
indeed
been
spoken
of
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
observe
the
woman
who
opened
the
door
to
you
when
you
called
yesterday
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
.
Was
not
it
<EOS>
Mrs
Speed
,
as
usual
,
or
the
maid
?
<EOS>
I
observed
no
one
in
particular
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
my
friend
Mrs
Rooke
;
Nurse
Rooke
;
who
,
by
-
the
-
bye
,
had
a
great
curiosity
to
see
you
,
and
was
delighted
to
be
in
the
way
to
let
you
in
.
<EOS>
She
came
away
from
Marlborough
Buildings
only
on
Sunday
;
and
she
<EOS>
it
was
who
told
me
you
were
to
marry
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
She
had
had
it
from
Mrs
Wallis
herself
,
which
did
not
seem
bad
authority
.
<EOS>
She
sat
an
hour
with
me
on
Monday
evening
,
and
gave
me
the
whole
history
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
whole
history
,
"
repeated
Anne
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
She
could
not
make
a
very
long
history
,
I
think
,
of
one
such
little
article
of
unfounded
news
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
continued
Anne
,
presently
,
"
though
there
is
no
truth
in
my
having
this
claim
on
Mr
Elliot
,
I
should
be
extremely
happy
to
be
of
use
to
you
in
any
way
that
I
could
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
mention
to
him
your
being
in
Bath
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
take
any
message
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
thank
you
:
<EOS>
no
,
certainly
not
.
<EOS>
In
the
warmth
of
the
moment
,
and
under
a
mistaken
impression
,
I
might
,
perhaps
,
have
endeavoured
to
interest
you
in
some
circumstances
;
but
not
now
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
thank
you
,
I
have
nothing
to
trouble
you
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
spoke
of
having
known
Mr
Elliot
many
years
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
before
he
was
married
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
he
was
not
married
when
I
knew
him
first
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
 
were
you
much
acquainted
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Intimately
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Then
do
tell
me
what
he
was
at
that
time
of
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
Mr
Elliot
was
as
a
very
young
man
.
<EOS>
Was
he
at
all
such
as
he
appears
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
seen
Mr
Elliot
these
three
years
,
"
was
Mrs
Smith
's
answer
,
given
so
gravely
that
it
was
impossible
to
pursue
the
subject
farther
;
and
Anne
felt
that
she
had
gained
nothing
but
an
increase
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
silent
:
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
very
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
At
last
    
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
Miss
Elliot
,
"
she
cried
,
in
her
natural
tone
of
cordiality
,
"
I
beg
your
pardon
for
the
short
answers
I
have
been
giving
you
,
but
I
have
been
uncertain
what
I
ought
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
doubting
and
considering
as
to
what
I
ought
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
There
were
many
things
to
be
taken
into
the
account
.
<EOS>
One
hates
to
be
officious
,
to
be
giving
bad
impressions
,
making
mischief
.
<EOS>
Even
the
smooth
surface
of
family
-
union
seems
worth
preserving
,
though
there
may
be
nothing
durable
beneath
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
have
determined
;
I
think
I
am
right
;
I
think
you
ought
to
be
made
acquainted
with
Mr
Elliot
's
real
character
.
<EOS>
Though
I
fully
believe
that
,
at
present
,
you
have
not
the
smallest
intention
of
accepting
him
,
there
is
no
saying
what
may
happen
.
<EOS>
You
might
,
some
time
or
other
,
be
differently
affected
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Hear
the
truth
,
therefore
,
now
,
while
you
are
unprejudiced
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
is
a
man
without
heart
or
conscience
;
a
designing
,
wary
,
cold
-
blooded
being
,
who
thinks
only
of
himself
;
whom
for
his
own
interest
or
ease
,
would
be
guilty
of
any
cruelty
,
or
any
treachery
,
that
could
be
perpetrated
without
risk
of
his
general
character
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
feeling
for
others
.
<EOS>
Those
whom
he
has
been
the
chief
cause
of
leading
into
ruin
,
he
can
neglect
and
desert
without
the
smallest
compunction
.
<EOS>
He
is
totally
beyond
the
reach
of
any
sentiment
of
justice
or
compassion
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
he
is
black
at
heart
,
hollow
and
black
!
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
astonished
air
,
and
exclamation
of
wonder
,
made
her
pause
,
and
in
a
calmer
manner
,
she
added
,
  
"
My
expressions
startle
you
.
<EOS>
You
must
allow
for
an
injured
,
angry
woman
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
try
to
command
myself
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
abuse
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
only
tell
you
what
I
have
found
him
.
<EOS>
Facts
shall
speak
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
intimate
friend
of
my
dear
husband
,
who
trusted
and
loved
him
,
and
thought
him
as
good
as
himself
.
<EOS>
The
intimacy
had
been
formed
before
our
marriage
.
<EOS>
I
found
them
most
intimate
friends
;
and
I
,
too
,
became
excessively
pleased
with
Mr
Elliot
,
and
entertained
the
highest
opinion
of
him
.
<EOS>
At
nineteen
,
you
know
,
one
does
not
think
very
seriously
;
but
Mr
Elliot
appeared
to
me
quite
as
good
as
others
,
and
much
more
agreeable
than
most
others
,
and
we
were
almost
always
together
.
<EOS>
We
were
principally
in
town
,
living
in
very
good
style
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
the
inferior
in
circumstances
;
he
was
then
the
poor
one
;
he
had
chambers
in
the
Temple
,
and
it
was
as
much
as
he
could
do
to
support
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
a
home
with
us
whenever
he
chose
it
;
he
was
always
welcome
;
he
was
like
a
brother
.
<EOS>
My
poor
Charles
,
who
had
the
finest
,
most
generous
spirit
in
the
world
,
would
have
divided
his
last
farthing
with
him
;
and
I
know
that
his
purse
was
open
to
him
;
I
know
that
he
often
assisted
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
must
have
been
about
that
very
period
of
Mr
Elliot
's
life
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
which
has
always
excited
my
particular
curiosity
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
about
the
same
time
that
he
became
known
to
my
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
I
never
knew
him
myself
;
I
only
heard
of
him
;
but
there
was
a
something
in
his
conduct
then
,
with
regard
to
my
father
and
sister
,
and
afterwards
in
the
circumstances
of
his
marriage
,
which
I
never
could
quite
reconcile
with
present
times
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
announce
a
different
sort
of
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
all
,
I
know
it
all
,
"
cried
Mrs
Smith
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
been
introduced
to
Sir
Walter
and
your
sister
before
I
was
acquainted
with
him
,
but
I
heard
him
speak
of
them
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
know
he
was
invited
and
encouraged
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
did
not
choose
to
go
.
<EOS>
I
can
satisfy
you
,
perhaps
,
on
points
which
you
would
little
expect
;
and
as
to
his
marriage
,
I
knew
all
about
it
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
privy
to
all
the
fors
and
againsts
;
I
was
the
friend
to
whom
he
confided
his
hopes
and
plans
;
and
though
I
did
not
know
his
wife
previously
,
her
inferior
situation
in
society
,
indeed
,
rendered
that
impossible
,
yet
I
knew
her
all
her
life
afterwards
,
or
at
least
till
within
the
last
two
years
of
her
life
,
and
can
answer
any
question
you
may
wish
to
put
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
I
have
no
particular
enquiry
to
make
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
understood
they
were
not
a
happy
couple
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
to
know
why
,
at
that
time
of
his
life
,
he
should
slight
my
father
's
acquaintance
as
he
did
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
certainly
disposed
to
take
very
kind
and
proper
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
Why
did
Mr
Elliot
draw
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr
Elliot
,
"
replied
Mrs
Smith
,
"
at
that
period
of
his
life
,
had
one
object
in
view
:
to
make
his
fortune
,
and
by
a
rather
quicker
process
than
the
law
.
<EOS>
He
was
determined
to
make
it
by
marriage
.
<EOS>
He
was
determined
,
at
least
,
not
to
mar
it
by
an
imprudent
marriage
;
and
I
know
it
was
his
belief
(
whether
justly
or
not
,
of
course
I
can
not
decide
)
,
that
your
father
and
sister
,
in
their
civilities
and
invitations
,
were
designing
a
match
between
the
heir
and
the
young
lady
,
and
it
was
impossible
that
such
a
match
should
have
answered
his
ideas
of
wealth
and
independence
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
motive
for
drawing
back
,
I
can
assure
you
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
the
whole
story
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
concealments
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
curious
,
that
having
just
left
you
behind
me
in
Bath
,
my
first
and
principal
acquaintance
on
marrying
should
be
your
cousin
;
and
that
,
through
him
,
I
should
be
continually
hearing
of
your
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
He
described
one
Miss
Elliot
,
and
I
thought
very
affectionately
of
the
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
cried
Anne
,
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
,
"
you
sometimes
spoke
of
me
to
Mr
Elliot
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
I
did
;
very
often
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
boast
of
my
own
Anne
Elliot
,
and
vouch
for
your
being
a
very
different
creature
from
 
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
checked
herself
just
in
time
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
accounts
for
something
which
Mr
Elliot
said
last
night
,
"
cried
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
explains
it
.
<EOS>
I
found
he
had
been
used
to
hear
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
comprehend
how
.
<EOS>
What
wild
imaginations
one
forms
where
dear
self
is
concerned
!
<EOS>
How
sure
to
be
mistaken
!
<EOS>
But
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
have
interrupted
you
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
married
then
completely
for
money
?
<EOS>
The
circumstances
,
probably
,
which
first
opened
your
eyes
to
his
character
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
hesitated
a
little
here
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
those
things
are
too
common
.
<EOS>
When
one
lives
in
the
world
,
a
man
or
woman
's
marrying
for
money
is
too
common
to
strike
one
as
it
ought
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
young
,
and
associated
only
with
the
young
,
and
we
were
a
thoughtless
,
gay
set
,
without
any
strict
rules
of
conduct
.
<EOS>
We
lived
for
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
I
think
differently
now
;
time
and
sickness
and
sorrow
have
given
me
other
notions
;
but
at
that
period
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
reprehensible
in
what
Mr
Elliot
was
doing
.
<EOS>
"
To
do
the
best
for
himself
,
"
passed
as
a
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
was
not
she
a
very
low
woman
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
which
I
objected
to
,
but
he
would
not
regard
.
<EOS>
Money
,
money
,
was
all
that
he
wanted
.
<EOS>
Her
father
was
a
grazier
,
her
grandfather
had
been
a
butcher
,
but
that
was
all
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
fine
woman
,
had
had
a
decent
education
,
was
brought
forward
by
some
cousins
,
thrown
by
chance
into
Mr
Elliot
's
company
,
and
fell
in
love
with
him
;
and
not
a
difficulty
or
a
scruple
was
there
on
his
side
,
with
respect
to
her
birth
.
<EOS>
All
his
caution
was
spent
in
being
secured
of
the
real
amount
of
her
fortune
,
before
he
committed
himself
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
whatever
esteem
Mr
Elliot
may
have
for
his
own
situation
in
life
now
,
as
a
young
man
he
had
not
the
smallest
value
for
it
.
<EOS>
His
chance
for
the
Kellynch
estate
was
something
,
but
all
the
honour
of
the
family
he
held
as
cheap
as
dirt
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
heard
him
declare
,
that
if
baronetcies
were
saleable
,
anybody
should
have
his
for
fifty
pounds
,
arms
and
motto
,
name
and
livery
included
;
but
I
will
not
pretend
to
repeat
half
that
I
used
to
hear
him
say
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
fair
;
and
yet
you
ought
to
have
proof
,
for
what
is
all
this
but
assertion
,
and
you
shall
have
proof
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
dear
Mrs
Smith
,
I
want
none
,
"
cried
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
asserted
nothing
contradictory
to
what
Mr
Elliot
appeared
to
be
some
years
ago
.
<EOS>
This
is
all
in
confirmation
,
rather
,
of
what
we
used
to
hear
and
believe
.
<EOS>
I
am
more
curious
to
know
why
he
should
be
so
different
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
for
my
satisfaction
,
if
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
ring
for
Mary
;
stay
:
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
will
have
the
still
greater
goodness
of
going
yourself
into
my
bedroom
,
and
bringing
me
the
small
inlaid
box
which
you
will
find
on
the
upper
shelf
of
the
closet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
seeing
her
friend
to
be
earnestly
bent
on
it
,
did
as
she
was
desired
.
<EOS>
The
box
was
brought
and
placed
before
her
,
and
Mrs
Smith
,
sighing
over
it
as
she
unlocked
it
,
said
    
"
This
is
full
of
papers
belonging
to
him
,
to
my
husband
;
a
small
portion
only
of
what
I
had
to
look
over
when
I
lost
him
.
<EOS>
The
letter
I
am
looking
for
was
one
written
by
Mr
Elliot
to
him
before
our
marriage
,
and
happened
to
be
saved
;
why
,
one
can
hardly
imagine
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
careless
and
immethodical
,
like
other
men
,
about
those
things
;
and
when
I
came
to
examine
his
papers
,
I
found
it
with
others
still
more
trivial
,
from
different
people
scattered
here
and
there
,
while
many
letters
and
memorandums
of
real
importance
had
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
;
I
would
not
burn
it
,
because
being
even
then
very
little
satisfied
with
Mr
Elliot
,
I
was
determined
to
preserve
every
document
of
former
intimacy
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
another
motive
for
being
glad
that
I
can
produce
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
letter
,
directed
to
"
Charles
Smith
,
Esq
.
<EOS>
Tunbridge
Wells
,
"
and
dated
from
London
,
as
far
back
as
July
,
1803
:
    
"
Dear
Smith
,
 
I
have
received
yours
.
<EOS>
Your
kindness
almost
overpowers
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
nature
had
made
such
hearts
as
yours
more
common
,
but
I
have
lived
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
in
the
world
,
and
have
seen
none
like
it
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
believe
me
,
I
have
no
need
of
your
services
,
being
in
cash
again
.
<EOS>
Give
me
joy
:
I
have
got
rid
of
Sir
Walter
and
<EOS>
Miss.
They
are
gone
back
to
Kellynch
,
and
almost
made
me
swear
to
visit
them
this
summer
;
but
my
first
visit
to
Kellynch
will
be
with
a
surveyor
,
to
tell
me
how
to
bring
it
with
best
advantage
to
the
hammer
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
,
nevertheless
,
is
not
unlikely
to
marry
again
;
he
is
quite
fool
enough
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
,
however
,
they
will
leave
me
in
peace
,
which
may
be
a
decent
equivalent
for
the
reversion
.
<EOS>
He
is
worse
than
last
year
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
any
name
but
Elliot
.
<EOS>
I
am
sick
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
name
of
Walter
I
can
drop
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
and
I
desire
you
will
never
insult
me
with
my
second
W.
again
,
meaning
,
for
the
rest
of
my
life
,
to
be
only
yours
truly
,
 
<EOS>
Wm
.
<EOS>
Elliot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
letter
could
not
be
read
without
putting
Anne
in
a
glow
;
and
Mrs
Smith
,
observing
the
high
colour
in
her
face
,
said
    
"
The
language
,
I
know
,
is
highly
disrespectful
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
forgot
the
exact
terms
,
I
have
a
perfect
impression
of
the
general
meaning
.
<EOS>
But
it
shows
you
the
man
.
<EOS>
Mark
his
professions
to
my
poor
husband
.
<EOS>
Can
any
thing
be
stronger
?
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
immediately
get
over
the
shock
and
mortification
of
finding
such
words
applied
to
her
father
.
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
recollect
that
her
seeing
the
letter
was
a
violation
of
the
laws
of
honour
,
that
no
one
ought
to
be
judged
or
to
be
known
by
such
testimonies
,
that
no
private
correspondence
could
bear
the
eye
of
others
,
before
she
could
recover
calmness
enough
to
return
the
letter
which
she
had
been
meditating
over
,
and
say
    
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
This
is
full
proof
undoubtedly
;
proof
of
every
thing
you
were
saying
.
<EOS>
But
why
be
acquainted
with
us
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
explain
this
too
,
"
cried
Mrs
Smith
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
really
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
I
have
shewn
you
Mr
Elliot
as
he
was
a
dozen
years
ago
,
and
I
will
shew
him
as
he
is
now
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
produce
written
proof
again
,
but
I
can
give
as
authentic
oral
testimony
as
you
can
desire
,
of
what
he
is
now
wanting
,
and
what
he
is
now
doing
.
<EOS>
He
is
no
hypocrite
now
.
<EOS>
He
truly
wants
to
marry
you
.
<EOS>
His
present
attentions
to
your
family
are
very
sincere
:
quite
from
the
heart
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
my
authority
:
his
friend
Colonel
Wallis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Colonel
Wallis
!
<EOS>
you
are
acquainted
with
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
come
to
me
in
quite
so
direct
a
line
as
that
;
it
takes
a
bend
or
two
,
but
nothing
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
stream
is
as
good
as
at
first
;
the
little
rubbish
it
collects
in
the
turnings
is
easily
moved
away
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
talks
unreservedly
to
Colonel
Wallis
of
his
views
on
you
,
which
said
Colonel
Wallis
,
I
imagine
to
be
,
in
himself
,
a
sensible
,
careful
,
discerning
sort
of
character
;
but
Colonel
Wallis
has
a
very
pretty
silly
wife
,
to
whom
he
tells
things
which
he
had
better
not
,
and
he
repeats
it
all
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
in
the
overflowing
spirits
of
her
recovery
,
repeats
it
all
to
her
nurse
;
and
the
nurse
knowing
my
acquaintance
with
you
,
very
naturally
brings
it
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
On
Monday
evening
,
my
good
friend
Mrs
Rooke
let
me
thus
much
into
the
secrets
of
Marlborough
Buildings
.
<EOS>
When
I
talked
of
a
whole
history
,
therefore
,
you
see
I
was
not
romancing
so
much
as
you
supposed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mrs
Smith
,
your
authority
is
deficient
.
<EOS>
This
will
not
do
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
's
having
any
views
on
me
will
not
in
the
least
account
for
the
efforts
he
made
towards
a
reconciliation
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
That
was
all
prior
to
my
coming
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
I
found
them
on
the
most
friendly
terms
when
I
arrived
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
did
;
I
know
it
all
perfectly
,
but
 
"
  
"
Indeed
,
Mrs
Smith
,
we
must
not
expect
to
get
real
information
in
such
a
line
.
<EOS>
Facts
or
opinions
which
are
to
pass
through
the
hands
of
so
many
,
to
be
misconceived
by
folly
in
one
,
and
ignorance
in
another
,
can
hardly
have
much
truth
left
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
give
me
a
hearing
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
be
able
to
judge
of
the
general
credit
due
,
by
listening
to
some
particulars
which
you
can
yourself
immediately
contradict
or
confirm
.
<EOS>
Nobody
supposes
that
you
were
his
first
inducement
.
<EOS>
He
had
seen
you
indeed
,
before
he
came
to
Bath
,
and
admired
you
,
but
without
knowing
it
to
be
you
.
<EOS>
So
says
my
historian
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
Is
this
true
?
<EOS>
Did
he
see
you
last
summer
or
autumn
,
"
somewhere
down
in
the
west
,
"
to
use
her
own
words
,
without
knowing
it
to
be
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
certainly
did
.
<EOS>
So
far
it
is
very
true
.
<EOS>
At
Lyme
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
be
at
Lyme
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
continued
Mrs
Smith
,
triumphantly
,
"
grant
my
friend
the
credit
due
to
the
establishment
of
the
first
point
asserted
.
<EOS>
He
saw
you
then
at
Lyme
,
and
liked
you
so
well
as
to
be
exceedingly
pleased
to
meet
with
you
again
in
Camden
Place
,
as
Miss
Anne
Elliot
,
and
from
that
moment
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
had
a
double
motive
in
his
visits
there
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
another
,
and
an
earlier
,
which
I
will
now
explain
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
anything
in
my
story
which
you
know
to
be
either
false
or
improbable
,
stop
me
.
<EOS>
My
account
states
,
that
your
sister
's
friend
,
the
lady
now
staying
with
you
,
whom
I
have
heard
you
mention
,
came
to
Bath
with
Miss
Elliot
and
Sir
Walter
as
long
ago
as
September
(
in
short
when
they
first
came
themselves
)
,
and
has
been
staying
there
ever
since
;
that
she
is
a
clever
,
insinuating
,
handsome
woman
,
poor
and
plausible
,
and
altogether
such
in
situation
and
manner
,
as
to
give
a
general
idea
,
among
Sir
Walter
's
acquaintance
,
of
her
meaning
to
be
Lady
Elliot
,
and
as
general
a
surprise
that
Miss
Elliot
should
be
apparently
,
blind
to
the
danger
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Smith
paused
a
moment
;
but
Anne
had
not
a
word
to
say
,
and
she
continued
    
<EOS>
"
This
was
the
light
in
which
it
appeared
to
those
who
knew
the
family
,
long
before
you
returned
to
it
;
and
Colonel
Wallis
had
his
eye
upon
your
father
enough
to
be
sensible
of
it
,
though
he
did
not
then
visit
in
Camden
Place
;
but
his
regard
for
Mr
Elliot
gave
him
an
interest
in
watching
all
that
was
going
on
there
,
and
when
Mr
Elliot
came
to
Bath
for
a
day
or
two
,
as
he
happened
to
do
a
little
before
Christmas
,
Colonel
Wallis
made
him
acquainted
with
the
appearance
of
things
,
and
the
reports
beginning
to
prevail
.
<EOS>
Now
you
are
to
understand
,
that
time
had
worked
a
very
material
change
in
Mr
Elliot
's
opinions
as
to
the
value
of
a
baronetcy
.
<EOS>
Upon
all
points
of
blood
and
connexion
he
is
a
completely
altered
man
.
<EOS>
Having
long
had
as
much
money
as
he
could
spend
,
nothing
to
wish
for
on
the
side
of
avarice
or
indulgence
,
he
has
been
gradually
learning
to
pin
his
happiness
upon
the
consequence
he
is
heir
to
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
coming
on
before
our
acquaintance
ceased
,
but
it
is
now
a
confirmed
feeling
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
bear
the
idea
of
not
being
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
,
therefore
,
that
the
news
he
heard
from
his
friend
could
not
be
very
agreeable
,
and
you
may
guess
what
it
produced
;
the
resolution
of
coming
back
to
Bath
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
of
fixing
himself
here
for
a
time
,
with
the
view
of
renewing
his
former
acquaintance
,
and
recovering
such
a
footing
in
the
family
as
might
give
him
the
means
of
ascertaining
the
degree
of
his
danger
,
and
of
circumventing
the
lady
if
he
found
it
material
.
<EOS>
This
was
agreed
upon
between
the
two
friends
as
the
only
thing
to
be
done
;
and
Colonel
Wallis
was
to
assist
in
every
way
that
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
be
introduced
,
and
Mrs
Wallis
was
to
be
introduced
,
and
everybody
was
to
be
introduced
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
came
back
accordingly
;
and
on
application
was
forgiven
,
as
you
know
,
and
re
-
admitted
into
the
family
;
and
there
it
was
his
constant
object
,
and
his
only
object
(
till
your
arrival
added
another
motive
)
,
to
watch
Sir
Walter
and
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
He
omitted
no
opportunity
of
being
with
them
,
threw
himself
in
their
way
,
called
at
all
hours
;
but
I
need
not
be
particular
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
You
can
imagine
what
an
artful
man
would
do
;
and
with
this
guide
,
perhaps
,
may
recollect
what
you
have
seen
him
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
you
tell
me
nothing
which
does
not
accord
with
what
I
have
known
,
or
could
imagine
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
something
offensive
in
the
details
of
cunning
.
<EOS>
The
manoeuvres
of
selfishness
and
duplicity
must
ever
be
revolting
,
but
I
have
heard
nothing
which
really
surprises
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
those
who
would
be
shocked
by
such
a
representation
of
Mr
Elliot
,
who
would
have
difficulty
in
believing
it
;
but
I
have
never
been
satisfied
.
<EOS>
I
have
always
wanted
some
other
motive
for
his
conduct
than
appeared
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
his
present
opinion
,
as
to
the
probability
of
the
event
he
has
been
in
dread
of
;
whether
he
considers
the
danger
to
be
lessening
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lessening
,
I
understand
,
"
replied
Mrs
Smith
.
"
<EOS>
He
thinks
Mrs
Clay
afraid
of
him
,
aware
that
he
sees
through
her
,
and
not
daring
to
proceed
as
she
might
do
in
his
absence
.
<EOS>
But
since
he
must
be
absent
some
time
or
other
,
I
do
not
perceive
how
he
can
ever
be
secure
while
she
holds
her
present
influence
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Wallis
has
an
amusing
idea
,
as
nurse
tells
me
,
that
it
is
to
be
put
into
the
marriage
articles
when
you
and
Mr
Elliot
marry
,
that
your
father
is
not
to
marry
Mrs
Clay
.
<EOS>
A
scheme
,
worthy
of
Mrs
Wallis
's
understanding
,
by
all
accounts
;
but
my
sensible
nurse
Rooke
sees
the
absurdity
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
be
sure
,
ma'am
,
"
said
she
,
"
it
would
not
prevent
his
marrying
anybody
else
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
to
own
the
truth
,
I
do
not
think
nurse
,
in
her
heart
,
is
a
very
strenuous
opposer
of
Sir
Walter
's
making
a
second
match
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
allowed
to
be
a
favourer
of
matrimony
,
you
know
;
and
(
since
self
will
intrude
)
who
can
say
that
she
may
not
have
some
flying
visions
of
attending
the
next
Lady
Elliot
,
through
Mrs
Wallis
's
recommendation
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
know
all
this
,
"
said
Anne
,
after
a
little
thoughtfulness
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
more
painful
to
me
in
some
respects
to
be
in
company
with
him
,
but
I
shall
know
better
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
My
line
of
conduct
will
be
more
direct
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
is
evidently
a
disingenuous
,
artificial
,
worldly
man
,
who
has
never
had
any
better
principle
to
guide
him
than
selfishness
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
Elliot
was
not
done
with
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
had
been
carried
away
from
her
first
direction
,
and
Anne
had
forgotten
,
in
the
interest
of
her
own
family
concerns
,
how
much
had
been
originally
implied
against
him
;
but
her
attention
was
now
called
to
the
explanation
of
those
first
hints
,
and
she
listened
to
a
recital
which
,
if
it
did
not
perfectly
justify
the
unqualified
bitterness
of
Mrs
Smith
,
proved
him
to
have
been
very
unfeeling
in
his
conduct
towards
her
;
very
deficient
both
in
justice
and
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
She
learned
that
(
the
intimacy
between
them
continuing
unimpaired
by
Mr
Elliot
's
marriage
)
they
had
been
as
before
always
together
,
and
Mr
Elliot
had
led
his
friend
into
expenses
much
beyond
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
did
not
want
to
take
blame
to
herself
,
and
was
most
tender
of
throwing
any
on
her
husband
;
but
Anne
could
collect
that
their
income
had
never
been
equal
to
their
style
of
living
,
and
that
from
the
first
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
general
and
joint
extravagance
.
<EOS>
From
his
wife
's
account
of
him
she
could
discern
Mr
Smith
to
have
been
a
man
of
warm
feelings
,
easy
temper
,
careless
habits
,
and
not
strong
understanding
,
much
more
amiable
than
his
friend
,
and
very
unlike
him
,
led
by
him
,
and
probably
despised
by
him
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
,
raised
by
his
marriage
to
great
affluence
,
and
disposed
to
every
gratification
of
pleasure
and
vanity
which
could
be
commanded
without
involving
himself
,
(
for
with
all
his
self
-
indulgence
he
had
become
a
prudent
man
)
,
and
beginning
to
be
rich
,
just
as
his
friend
ought
to
have
found
himself
to
be
poor
,
seemed
to
have
had
no
concern
at
all
for
that
friend
's
probable
finances
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
had
been
prompting
and
encouraging
expenses
which
could
end
only
in
ruin
;
and
the
Smiths
accordingly
had
been
ruined
.
  
<EOS>
The
husband
had
died
just
in
time
to
be
spared
the
full
knowledge
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
had
previously
known
embarrassments
enough
to
try
the
friendship
of
their
friends
,
and
to
prove
that
Mr
Elliot
's
had
better
not
be
tried
;
but
it
was
not
till
his
death
that
the
wretched
state
of
his
affairs
was
fully
known
.
<EOS>
With
a
confidence
in
Mr
Elliot
's
regard
,
more
creditable
to
his
feelings
than
his
judgement
,
Mr
Smith
had
appointed
him
the
executor
of
his
will
;
but
Mr
Elliot
would
not
act
,
and
the
difficulties
and
distress
which
this
refusal
had
heaped
on
her
,
in
addition
to
the
inevitable
sufferings
of
her
situation
,
had
been
such
as
could
not
be
related
without
anguish
of
spirit
,
or
listened
to
without
corresponding
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
was
shewn
some
letters
of
his
on
the
occasion
,
answers
to
urgent
applications
from
Mrs
Smith
,
which
all
breathed
the
same
stern
resolution
of
not
engaging
in
a
fruitless
trouble
,
and
,
under
a
cold
civility
,
the
same
hard
-
hearted
indifference
to
any
of
the
evils
it
might
bring
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreadful
picture
of
ingratitude
and
inhumanity
;
and
Anne
felt
,
at
some
moments
,
that
no
flagrant
open
crime
could
have
been
worse
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
great
deal
to
listen
to
;
all
the
particulars
of
past
sad
scenes
,
all
the
minutiae
of
distress
upon
distress
,
which
in
former
conversations
had
been
merely
hinted
at
,
were
dwelt
on
now
with
a
natural
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
perfectly
comprehend
the
exquisite
relief
,
and
was
only
the
more
inclined
to
wonder
at
the
composure
of
her
friend
's
usual
state
of
mind
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
circumstance
in
the
history
of
her
grievances
of
particular
irritation
.
<EOS>
She
had
good
reason
to
believe
that
some
property
of
her
husband
in
the
West
Indies
,
which
had
been
for
many
years
under
a
sort
of
sequestration
for
the
payment
of
its
own
incumbrances
,
might
be
recoverable
by
proper
measures
;
and
this
property
,
though
not
large
,
would
be
enough
to
make
her
comparatively
rich
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
nobody
to
stir
in
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
would
do
nothing
,
and
she
could
do
nothing
herself
,
equally
disabled
from
personal
exertion
by
her
state
of
bodily
weakness
,
and
from
employing
others
by
her
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
natural
connexions
to
assist
her
even
with
their
counsel
,
and
she
could
not
afford
to
purchase
the
assistance
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
cruel
aggravation
of
actually
straitened
means
.
<EOS>
To
feel
that
she
ought
to
be
in
better
circumstances
,
that
a
little
trouble
in
the
right
place
might
do
it
,
and
to
fear
that
delay
might
be
even
weakening
her
claims
,
was
hard
to
bear
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
this
point
that
she
had
hoped
to
engage
Anne
's
good
offices
with
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
She
had
previously
,
in
the
anticipation
of
their
marriage
,
been
very
apprehensive
of
losing
her
friend
by
it
;
but
on
being
assured
that
he
could
have
made
no
attempt
of
that
nature
,
since
he
did
not
even
know
her
to
be
in
Bath
,
it
immediately
occurred
,
that
something
might
be
done
in
her
favour
by
the
influence
of
the
woman
he
loved
,
and
she
had
been
hastily
preparing
to
interest
Anne
's
feelings
,
as
far
as
the
observances
due
to
Mr
Elliot
's
character
would
allow
,
when
Anne
's
refutation
of
the
supposed
engagement
changed
the
face
of
everything
;
and
while
it
took
from
her
the
new
-
formed
hope
of
succeeding
in
the
object
of
her
first
anxiety
,
left
her
at
least
the
comfort
of
telling
the
whole
story
her
own
way
.
  
<EOS>
After
listening
to
this
full
description
of
Mr
Elliot
,
Anne
could
not
but
express
some
surprise
at
Mrs
Smith
's
having
spoken
of
him
so
favourably
in
the
beginning
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
seemed
to
recommend
and
praise
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
was
Mrs
Smith
's
reply
,
"
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
I
considered
your
marrying
him
as
certain
,
though
he
might
not
yet
have
made
the
offer
,
and
I
could
no
more
speak
the
truth
of
him
,
than
if
he
had
been
your
husband
.
<EOS>
My
heart
bled
for
you
,
as
I
talked
of
happiness
;
and
yet
he
is
sensible
,
he
is
agreeable
,
and
with
such
a
woman
as
you
,
it
was
not
absolutely
hopeless
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
unkind
to
his
first
wife
.
<EOS>
They
were
wretched
together
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
too
ignorant
and
giddy
for
respect
,
and
he
had
never
loved
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
willing
to
hope
that
you
must
fare
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
just
acknowledge
within
herself
such
a
possibility
of
having
been
induced
to
marry
him
,
as
made
her
shudder
at
the
idea
of
the
misery
which
must
have
followed
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
possible
that
she
might
have
been
persuaded
by
Lady
Russell
!
<EOS>
And
under
such
a
supposition
,
which
would
have
been
most
miserable
,
when
time
had
disclosed
all
,
too
late
?
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
desirable
that
Lady
Russell
should
be
no
longer
deceived
;
and
one
of
the
concluding
arrangements
of
this
important
conference
,
which
carried
them
through
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
,
was
,
that
Anne
had
full
liberty
to
communicate
to
her
friend
everything
relative
to
Mrs
Smith
,
in
which
his
conduct
was
involved
.
    
<EOS>
Anne
went
home
to
think
over
all
that
she
had
heard
.
<EOS>
In
one
point
,
her
feelings
were
relieved
by
this
knowledge
of
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
longer
anything
of
tenderness
due
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
stood
as
opposed
to
Captain
Wentworth
,
in
all
his
own
unwelcome
obtrusiveness
;
and
the
evil
of
his
attentions
last
night
,
the
irremediable
mischief
he
might
have
done
,
was
considered
with
sensations
unqualified
,
unperplexed
.
<EOS>
Pity
for
him
was
all
over
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
the
only
point
of
relief
.
<EOS>
In
every
other
respect
,
in
looking
around
her
,
or
penetrating
forward
,
she
saw
more
to
distrust
and
to
apprehend
.
<EOS>
She
was
concerned
for
the
disappointment
and
pain
Lady
Russell
would
be
feeling
;
for
the
mortifications
which
must
be
hanging
over
her
father
and
sister
,
and
had
all
the
distress
of
foreseeing
many
evils
,
without
knowing
how
to
avert
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
most
thankful
for
her
own
knowledge
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
considered
herself
as
entitled
to
reward
for
not
slighting
an
old
friend
like
Mrs
Smith
,
but
here
was
a
reward
indeed
springing
from
it
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
had
been
able
to
tell
her
what
no
one
else
could
have
done
.
<EOS>
Could
the
knowledge
have
been
extended
through
her
family
?
<EOS>
But
this
was
a
vain
idea
.
<EOS>
She
must
talk
to
Lady
Russell
,
tell
her
,
consult
with
her
,
and
having
done
her
best
,
wait
the
event
with
as
much
composure
as
possible
;
and
after
all
,
her
greatest
want
of
composure
would
be
in
that
quarter
of
the
mind
which
could
not
be
opened
to
Lady
Russell
;
in
that
flow
of
anxieties
and
fears
which
must
be
all
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
She
found
,
on
reaching
home
,
that
she
had
,
as
she
intended
,
escaped
seeing
Mr
Elliot
;
that
he
had
called
and
paid
them
a
long
morning
visit
;
but
hardly
had
she
congratulated
herself
,
and
felt
safe
,
when
she
heard
that
he
was
coming
again
in
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
not
the
smallest
intention
of
asking
him
,
"
said
Elizabeth
,
with
affected
carelessness
,
"
but
he
gave
so
many
hints
;
so
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
says
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
I
do
say
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
anybody
in
my
life
spell
harder
for
an
invitation
.
<EOS>
Poor
man
!
<EOS>
I
was
really
in
pain
for
him
;
for
your
hard
-
hearted
sister
,
Miss
Anne
,
seems
bent
on
cruelty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
"
cried
Elizabeth
,
"
I
have
been
rather
too
much
used
to
the
game
to
be
soon
overcome
by
a
gentleman
's
hints
.
<EOS>
However
,
when
I
found
how
excessively
he
was
regretting
that
he
should
miss
my
father
this
morning
,
I
gave
way
immediately
,
for
I
would
never
really
omit
an
opportunity
of
bring
him
and
Sir
Walter
together
.
<EOS>
They
appear
to
so
much
advantage
in
company
with
each
other
.
<EOS>
Each
behaving
so
pleasantly
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
looking
up
with
so
much
respect
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
delightful
!
"
cried
Mrs
Clay
,
not
daring
,
however
,
to
turn
her
eyes
towards
Anne
.
"
<EOS>
Exactly
like
father
and
son
!
<EOS>
Dear
Miss
Elliot
,
may
I
not
say
father
and
son
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
I
lay
no
embargo
on
any
body
's
words
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
have
such
ideas
!
<EOS>
But
,
upon
my
word
,
I
am
scarcely
sensible
of
his
attentions
being
beyond
those
of
other
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Miss
Elliot
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs
Clay
,
lifting
her
hands
and
eyes
,
and
sinking
all
the
rest
of
her
astonishment
in
a
convenient
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
my
dear
Penelope
,
you
need
not
be
so
alarmed
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
did
invite
him
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
sent
him
away
with
smiles
.
<EOS>
When
I
found
he
was
really
going
to
his
friends
at
Thornberry
Park
for
the
whole
day
to
-
morrow
,
I
had
compassion
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
admired
the
good
acting
of
the
friend
,
in
being
able
to
shew
such
pleasure
as
she
did
,
in
the
expectation
and
in
the
actual
arrival
of
the
very
person
whose
presence
must
really
be
interfering
with
her
prime
object
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
but
that
Mrs
Clay
must
hate
the
sight
of
Mr
Elliot
;
and
yet
she
could
assume
a
most
obliging
,
placid
look
,
and
appear
quite
satisfied
with
the
curtailed
license
of
devoting
herself
only
half
as
much
to
Sir
Walter
as
she
would
have
done
otherwise
.
  
<EOS>
To
Anne
herself
it
was
most
distressing
to
see
Mr
Elliot
enter
the
room
;
and
quite
painful
to
have
him
approach
and
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
used
before
to
feel
that
he
could
not
be
always
quite
sincere
,
but
now
she
saw
insincerity
in
everything
.
<EOS>
His
attentive
deference
to
her
father
,
contrasted
with
his
former
language
,
was
odious
;
and
when
she
thought
of
his
cruel
conduct
towards
Mrs
Smith
,
she
could
hardly
bear
the
sight
of
his
present
smiles
and
mildness
,
or
the
sound
of
his
artificial
good
sentiments
.
  
<EOS>
She
meant
to
avoid
any
such
alteration
of
manners
as
might
provoke
a
remonstrance
on
his
side
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
object
to
her
to
escape
all
enquiry
or
eclat
;
but
it
was
her
intention
to
be
as
decidedly
cool
to
him
as
might
be
compatible
with
their
relationship
;
and
to
retrace
,
as
quietly
as
she
could
,
the
few
steps
of
unnecessary
intimacy
she
had
been
gradually
led
along
.
<EOS>
She
was
accordingly
more
guarded
,
and
more
cool
,
than
she
had
been
the
night
before
.
  
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
animate
her
curiosity
again
as
to
how
and
where
he
could
have
heard
her
formerly
praised
;
wanted
very
much
to
be
gratified
by
more
solicitation
;
but
the
charm
was
broken
:
he
found
that
the
heat
and
animation
of
a
public
room
was
necessary
to
kindle
his
modest
cousin
's
vanity
;
he
found
,
at
least
,
that
it
was
not
to
be
done
now
,
by
any
of
those
attempts
which
he
could
hazard
among
the
too
-
commanding
claims
of
the
others
.
<EOS>
He
little
surmised
that
it
was
a
subject
acting
now
exactly
against
his
interest
,
bringing
immediately
to
her
thoughts
all
those
parts
of
his
conduct
which
were
least
excusable
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
some
satisfaction
in
finding
that
he
was
really
going
out
of
Bath
the
next
morning
,
going
early
,
and
that
he
would
be
gone
the
greater
part
of
two
days
.
<EOS>
He
was
invited
again
to
Camden
Place
the
very
evening
of
his
return
;
but
from
Thursday
to
Saturday
evening
his
absence
was
certain
.
<EOS>
It
was
bad
enough
that
a
Mrs
Clay
should
be
always
before
her
;
but
that
a
deeper
hypocrite
should
be
added
to
their
party
,
seemed
the
destruction
of
everything
like
peace
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
humiliating
to
reflect
on
the
constant
deception
practised
on
her
father
and
Elizabeth
;
to
consider
the
various
sources
of
mortification
preparing
for
them
!
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
's
selfishness
was
not
so
complicate
nor
so
revolting
as
his
;
and
Anne
would
have
compounded
for
the
marriage
at
once
,
with
all
its
evils
,
to
be
clear
of
Mr
Elliot
's
subtleties
in
endeavouring
to
prevent
it
.
  
<EOS>
On
Friday
morning
she
meant
to
go
very
early
to
Lady
Russell
,
and
accomplish
the
necessary
communication
;
and
she
would
have
gone
directly
after
breakfast
,
but
that
Mrs
Clay
was
also
going
out
on
some
obliging
purpose
of
saving
her
sister
trouble
,
which
determined
her
to
wait
till
she
might
be
safe
from
such
a
companion
.
<EOS>
She
saw
Mrs
Clay
fairly
off
,
therefore
,
before
she
began
to
talk
of
spending
the
morning
in
Rivers
Street
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
Elizabeth
,
"
I
have
nothing
to
send
but
my
love
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
you
may
as
well
take
back
that
tiresome
book
she
would
lend
me
,
and
pretend
I
have
read
it
through
.
<EOS>
I
really
can
not
be
plaguing
myself
for
ever
with
all
the
new
poems
and
states
of
the
nation
that
come
out
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
quite
bores
one
with
her
new
publications
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
tell
her
so
,
but
I
thought
her
dress
hideous
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
think
she
had
some
taste
in
dress
,
but
I
was
ashamed
of
her
at
the
concert
.
<EOS>
Something
so
formal
and
arrange
in
her
air
!
<EOS>
and
she
sits
so
upright
!
<EOS>
My
best
love
,
of
course
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
mine
,
"
added
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
"
Kindest
regards
.
<EOS>
And
you
may
say
,
that
I
mean
to
call
upon
her
soon
.
<EOS>
Make
a
civil
message
;
but
I
shall
only
leave
my
card
.
<EOS>
Morning
visits
are
never
fair
by
women
at
her
time
of
life
,
who
make
themselves
up
so
little
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
only
wear
rouge
she
would
not
be
afraid
of
being
seen
;
but
last
time
I
called
<EOS>
,
I
observed
the
blinds
were
let
down
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
her
father
spoke
,
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Who
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
Anne
,
remembering
the
preconcerted
visits
,
at
all
hours
,
of
Mr
Elliot
,
would
have
expected
him
,
but
for
his
known
engagement
seven
miles
off
.
<EOS>
After
the
usual
period
of
suspense
,
the
usual
sounds
of
approach
were
heard
,
and
"
Mr
and
Mrs
Charles
Musgrove
"
were
ushered
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Surprise
was
the
strongest
emotion
raised
by
their
appearance
;
but
Anne
was
really
glad
to
see
them
;
and
the
others
were
not
so
sorry
but
that
they
could
put
on
a
decent
air
of
welcome
;
and
as
soon
as
it
became
clear
that
these
,
their
nearest
relations
,
were
not
arrived
with
any
views
of
accommodation
in
that
house
,
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
able
to
rise
in
cordiality
,
and
do
the
honours
of
it
very
well
.
<EOS>
They
were
come
to
Bath
for
a
few
days
with
Mrs
Musgrove
,
and
were
at
the
White
Hart
.
<EOS>
So
much
was
pretty
soon
understood
;
but
till
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
walking
Mary
into
the
other
drawing
-
room
,
and
regaling
themselves
with
her
admiration
,
Anne
could
not
draw
upon
Charles
's
brain
for
a
regular
history
of
their
coming
,
or
an
explanation
of
some
smiling
hints
of
particular
business
,
which
had
been
ostentatiously
dropped
by
Mary
,
as
well
as
of
some
apparent
confusion
as
to
whom
their
party
consisted
of
.
  
<EOS>
She
then
found
that
it
consisted
of
Mrs
Musgrove
,
Henrietta
,
and
Captain
Harville
,
beside
their
two
selves
.
<EOS>
He
gave
her
a
very
plain
,
intelligible
account
of
the
whole
;
a
narration
in
which
she
saw
a
great
deal
of
most
characteristic
proceeding
.
<EOS>
The
scheme
had
received
its
first
impulse
by
Captain
Harville
's
wanting
to
come
to
Bath
on
business
.
<EOS>
He
had
begun
to
talk
of
it
a
week
ago
;
and
by
way
of
doing
something
,
as
shooting
was
over
,
Charles
had
proposed
coming
with
him
,
and
Mrs
Harville
had
seemed
to
like
the
idea
of
it
very
much
,
as
an
advantage
to
her
husband
;
but
Mary
could
not
bear
to
be
left
,
and
had
made
herself
so
unhappy
about
it
,
that
for
a
day
or
two
everything
seemed
to
be
in
suspense
,
or
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
it
had
been
taken
up
by
his
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
His
mother
had
some
old
friends
in
Bath
whom
she
wanted
to
see
;
it
was
thought
a
good
opportunity
for
Henrietta
to
come
and
buy
wedding
-
clothes
for
herself
and
her
sister
;
and
,
in
short
,
it
ended
in
being
his
mother
's
party
,
that
everything
might
be
comfortable
and
easy
to
Captain
Harville
;
and
he
and
Mary
were
included
in
it
by
way
of
general
convenience
.
<EOS>
They
had
arrived
late
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Harville
,
her
children
,
and
Captain
Benwick
,
remained
with
Mr
Musgrove
and
Louisa
at
Uppercross
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
's
only
surprise
was
,
that
affairs
should
be
in
forwardness
enough
for
Henrietta
's
wedding
-
clothes
to
be
talked
of
.
<EOS>
She
had
imagined
such
difficulties
of
fortune
to
exist
there
as
must
prevent
the
marriage
from
being
near
at
hand
;
but
she
learned
from
Charles
that
,
very
recently
,
(
since
Mary
's
last
letter
to
herself
)
,
Charles
Hayter
had
been
applied
to
by
a
friend
to
hold
a
living
for
a
youth
who
could
not
possibly
claim
it
under
many
years
;
and
that
on
the
strength
of
his
present
income
,
with
almost
a
certainty
of
something
more
permanent
long
before
the
term
in
question
,
the
two
families
had
consented
to
the
young
people
's
wishes
,
and
that
their
marriage
was
likely
to
take
place
in
a
few
months
,
quite
as
soon
as
Louisa
's
.
"
And
a
very
good
living
it
was
,
"
Charles
added
:
"
only
five
-
and
-
twenty
miles
from
Uppercross
,
and
in
a
very
fine
country
:
fine
part
of
Dorsetshire
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
some
of
the
best
preserves
in
the
kingdom
,
surrounded
by
three
great
proprietors
,
each
more
careful
and
jealous
than
the
other
;
and
to
two
of
the
three
at
least
,
Charles
Hayter
might
get
a
special
recommendation
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
will
value
it
as
he
ought
,
"
he
observed
,
"
Charles
is
too
cool
about
sporting
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
worst
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
extremely
glad
,
indeed
,
"
cried
Anne
,
"
particularly
glad
that
this
should
happen
;
and
that
of
two
sisters
,
who
both
deserve
equally
well
,
and
who
have
always
been
such
good
friends
,
the
pleasant
prospect
of
one
should
not
be
dimming
those
of
the
other
 
that
they
should
be
so
equal
in
their
prosperity
and
comfort
.
<EOS>
I
hope
your
father
and
mother
are
quite
happy
with
regard
to
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
yes
.
<EOS>
My
father
would
be
well
pleased
if
the
gentlemen
were
richer
,
but
he
has
no
other
fault
to
find
.
<EOS>
Money
,
you
know
,
coming
down
with
money
 
<EOS>
two
daughters
at
once
 
it
can
not
be
a
very
agreeable
operation
,
and
it
streightens
him
as
to
many
things
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
do
not
mean
to
say
they
have
not
a
right
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
fit
they
should
have
daughters
'
shares
;
and
I
am
sure
he
has
always
been
a
very
kind
,
liberal
father
to
me
.
<EOS>
Mary
does
not
above
half
like
Henrietta
's
match
.
<EOS>
She
never
did
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
But
she
does
not
do
him
justice
,
nor
think
enough
about
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
her
attend
to
the
value
of
the
property
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
fair
match
,
as
times
go
;
and
I
have
liked
Charles
Hayter
all
my
life
,
and
I
shall
not
leave
off
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Such
excellent
parents
as
Mr
and
Mrs
Musgrove
,
"
exclaimed
Anne
,
"
should
be
happy
in
their
children
's
marriages
.
<EOS>
They
do
everything
to
confer
happiness
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
What
a
blessing
to
young
people
to
be
in
such
hands
!
<EOS>
Your
father
and
mother
seem
so
totally
free
from
all
those
ambitious
feelings
which
have
led
to
so
much
misconduct
and
misery
,
both
in
young
and
old
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
think
Louisa
perfectly
recovered
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
answered
rather
hesitatingly
,
"
Yes
,
I
believe
I
do
;
very
much
recovered
;
but
she
is
altered
;
there
is
no
running
or
jumping
about
,
no
laughing
or
dancing
;
it
is
quite
different
.
<EOS>
If
one
happens
only
to
shut
the
door
a
little
hard
,
she
starts
and
wriggles
like
a
young
dab
-
chick
in
the
water
;
and
Benwick
sits
at
her
elbow
,
reading
verses
,
or
whispering
to
her
,
all
day
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
could
not
help
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
That
can
not
be
much
to
your
taste
,
I
know
,
"
said
she
;
"
but
I
do
believe
him
to
be
an
excellent
young
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
he
is
.
<EOS>
Nobody
doubts
it
;
and
I
hope
you
do
not
think
I
am
so
illiberal
as
to
want
every
man
to
have
the
same
objects
and
pleasures
as
myself
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
value
for
Benwick
;
and
when
one
can
but
get
him
to
talk
,
he
has
plenty
to
say
.
<EOS>
His
reading
has
done
him
no
harm
,
for
he
has
fought
as
well
as
read
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
brave
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
got
more
acquainted
with
him
last
Monday
than
ever
<EOS>
I
did
before
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
famous
set
-
to
at
rat
-
hunting
<EOS>
all
the
morning
in
my
father
's
great
barns
;
and
he
played
his
part
so
well
that
I
have
liked
him
the
better
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
the
absolute
necessity
of
Charles
's
following
the
others
to
admire
mirrors
and
china
;
but
Anne
had
heard
enough
to
understand
the
present
state
of
Uppercross
,
and
rejoice
in
its
happiness
;
and
though
she
sighed
as
she
rejoiced
,
her
sigh
had
none
of
the
ill
-
will
of
envy
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
would
certainly
have
risen
to
their
blessings
if
she
could
,
but
she
did
not
want
to
lessen
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
The
visit
passed
off
altogether
in
high
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Mary
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
enjoying
the
gaiety
and
the
change
,
and
so
well
satisfied
with
the
journey
in
her
mother
-
in
-
law
's
carriage
with
four
horses
,
and
with
her
own
complete
independence
of
Camden
Place
,
that
she
was
exactly
in
a
temper
to
admire
everything
as
she
ought
,
and
enter
most
readily
into
all
the
superiorities
of
the
house
,
as
they
were
detailed
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
demands
on
her
father
or
sister
,
and
her
consequence
was
just
enough
increased
by
their
handsome
drawing
-
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
was
,
for
a
short
time
,
suffering
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
Mrs
Musgrove
and
all
her
party
ought
to
be
asked
to
dine
with
them
;
but
she
could
not
bear
to
have
the
difference
of
style
,
the
reduction
of
servants
,
which
a
dinner
must
betray
,
witnessed
by
those
who
had
been
always
so
inferior
to
the
Elliots
of
Kellynch
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
struggle
between
propriety
and
vanity
;
but
vanity
got
the
better
,
and
then
Elizabeth
was
happy
again
.
<EOS>
These
were
her
internal
persuasions
:
"
Old
fashioned
notions
;
country
hospitality
;
we
do
not
profess
to
give
dinners
;
few
people
in
Bath
do
;
Lady
Alicia
never
does
;
did
not
even
ask
her
own
sister
's
family
,
though
they
were
here
a
month
:
<EOS>
and
I
dare
say
it
would
be
very
inconvenient
to
Mrs
Musgrove
;
put
her
quite
out
of
her
way
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
she
would
rather
not
come
;
she
can
not
feel
easy
with
us
.
<EOS>
I
will
ask
them
all
for
an
evening
;
that
will
be
much
better
;
that
will
be
a
novelty
and
a
treat
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
seen
two
such
drawing
rooms
before
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
delighted
to
come
to
-
morrow
evening
.
<EOS>
It
shall
be
a
regular
party
,
small
,
but
most
elegant
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
satisfied
Elizabeth
:
<EOS>
and
when
the
invitation
was
given
to
the
two
present
,
and
promised
for
the
absent
,
Mary
was
as
completely
satisfied
.
<EOS>
She
was
particularly
asked
to
meet
Mr
Elliot
,
and
be
introduced
to
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
,
who
were
fortunately
already
engaged
to
come
;
and
she
could
not
have
received
a
more
gratifying
attention
.
<EOS>
Miss
Elliot
was
to
have
the
honour
of
calling
on
Mrs
Musgrove
in
the
course
of
the
morning
;
and
Anne
walked
off
with
Charles
and
Mary
,
to
go
and
see
her
and
Henrietta
directly
.
  
<EOS>
Her
plan
of
sitting
with
Lady
Russell
must
give
way
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
They
all
three
called
in
Rivers
Street
for
a
couple
of
minutes
;
but
Anne
convinced
herself
that
a
day
's
delay
of
the
intended
communication
could
be
of
no
consequence
,
and
hastened
forward
to
the
White
Hart
,
to
see
again
the
friends
and
companions
of
the
last
autumn
,
with
an
eagerness
of
good
-
will
which
many
associations
contributed
to
form
.
  
<EOS>
They
found
Mrs
Musgrove
and
her
daughter
within
,
and
by
themselves
,
and
Anne
had
the
kindest
welcome
from
each
.
<EOS>
Henrietta
was
exactly
in
that
state
of
recently
-
improved
views
,
of
fresh
-
formed
happiness
,
which
made
her
full
of
regard
and
interest
for
everybody
she
had
ever
liked
before
at
all
;
and
Mrs
Musgrove
's
real
affection
had
been
won
by
her
usefulness
when
they
were
in
distress
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
heartiness
,
and
a
warmth
,
and
a
sincerity
which
Anne
delighted
in
the
more
,
from
the
sad
want
of
such
blessings
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
was
entreated
to
give
them
as
much
of
her
time
as
possible
,
invited
for
every
day
and
all
day
long
,
or
rather
claimed
as
part
of
the
family
;
and
,
in
return
,
she
naturally
fell
into
all
her
wonted
ways
of
attention
and
assistance
,
and
on
Charles
's
leaving
them
together
,
was
listening
to
Mrs
Musgrove
's
history
of
Louisa
,
and
to
Henrietta
's
of
herself
,
giving
opinions
on
business
,
and
recommendations
to
shops
;
with
intervals
of
every
help
which
Mary
required
,
from
altering
her
ribbon
to
settling
her
accounts
;
from
finding
her
keys
,
and
assorting
her
trinkets
,
to
trying
to
convince
her
that
she
was
not
ill
-
used
by
anybody
;
which
Mary
,
well
amused
as
she
generally
was
,
in
her
station
at
a
window
overlooking
the
entrance
to
the
Pump
Room
,
<EOS>
could
not
but
have
her
moments
of
imagining
.
  
<EOS>
A
morning
of
thorough
confusion
was
to
be
expected
.
<EOS>
A
large
party
in
an
hotel
ensured
a
quick
-
changing
,
unsettled
scene
.
<EOS>
One
five
minutes
brought
a
note
,
the
next
a
parcel
;
and
Anne
had
not
been
there
half
an
hour
,
when
their
dining
-
room
,
spacious
as
it
was
,
seemed
more
than
half
filled
:
a
party
of
steady
old
friends
were
seated
around
Mrs
Musgrove
,
and
Charles
came
back
with
Captains
Harville
and
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
latter
could
not
be
more
than
the
surprise
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
have
forgotten
to
feel
that
this
arrival
of
their
common
friends
must
be
soon
bringing
them
together
again
.
<EOS>
Their
last
meeting
had
been
most
important
in
opening
his
feelings
;
she
had
derived
from
it
a
delightful
conviction
;
but
she
feared
from
his
looks
,
that
the
same
unfortunate
persuasion
,
which
had
hastened
him
away
from
the
Concert
Room
,
still
governed
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
seem
to
want
to
be
near
enough
for
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
She
tried
to
be
calm
,
and
leave
things
to
take
their
course
,
and
tried
to
dwell
much
on
this
argument
of
rational
dependence
:
 
"
Surely
,
if
there
be
constant
attachment
on
each
side
,
our
hearts
must
understand
each
other
ere
long
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
boy
and
girl
,
to
be
captiously
irritable
,
misled
by
every
moment
's
inadvertence
,
and
wantonly
playing
with
our
own
happiness
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
she
felt
as
if
their
being
in
company
with
each
other
,
under
their
present
circumstances
,
could
only
be
exposing
them
to
inadvertencies
and
misconstructions
of
the
most
mischievous
kind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anne
,
"
cried
Mary
,
still
at
her
window
<EOS>
,
"
there
is
Mrs
Clay
,
I
am
sure
,
standing
under
the
colonnade
,
and
a
gentleman
with
her
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
turn
the
corner
from
Bath
Street
just
now
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
deep
in
talk
.
<EOS>
Who
is
it
?
<EOS>
Come
,
and
tell
me
.
<EOS>
Good
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
recollect
.
<EOS>
It
is
Mr
Elliot
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
cried
Anne
,
quickly
,
"
<EOS>
it
can
not
be
Mr
Elliot
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
leave
Bath
at
nine
this
morning
,
and
does
not
come
back
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
spoke
,
she
felt
that
Captain
Wentworth
was
looking
at
her
,
the
consciousness
of
which
vexed
and
embarrassed
her
,
and
made
her
regret
that
she
had
said
so
much
,
simple
as
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
,
resenting
that
she
should
be
supposed
not
to
know
her
own
cousin
,
began
talking
very
warmly
about
the
family
features
,
and
protesting
still
more
positively
that
it
was
Mr
Elliot
,
calling
again
upon
Anne
to
come
and
look
for
herself
,
but
Anne
did
not
mean
to
stir
,
and
tried
to
be
cool
and
unconcerned
.
<EOS>
Her
distress
returned
,
however
,
on
perceiving
smiles
and
intelligent
glances
pass
between
two
or
three
of
the
lady
visitors
,
as
if
they
believed
themselves
quite
in
the
secret
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
the
report
concerning
her
had
spread
,
and
a
short
pause
succeeded
,
which
seemed
to
ensure
that
it
would
now
spread
farther
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
come
,
Anne
"
cried
Mary
,
"
come
and
look
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
too
late
if
you
do
not
make
haste
.
<EOS>
They
are
parting
;
they
are
shaking
hands
.
<EOS>
He
is
turning
away
.
<EOS>
Not
know
Mr
Elliot
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
You
seem
to
have
forgot
all
about
Lyme
.
"
  
<EOS>
To
pacify
Mary
,
and
perhaps
screen
her
own
embarrassment
,
Anne
did
move
quietly
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
in
time
to
ascertain
that
it
really
was
Mr
Elliot
,
which
she
had
never
believed
,
before
he
disappeared
on
one
side
,
as
Mrs
Clay
walked
quickly
off
on
the
other
;
and
checking
the
surprise
which
she
could
not
but
feel
at
such
an
appearance
of
friendly
conference
between
two
persons
of
totally
opposite
interest
,
she
calmly
said
,
"
Yes
,
it
is
Mr
Elliot
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
He
has
changed
his
hour
of
going
,
I
suppose
,
that
is
all
,
or
I
may
be
mistaken
,
I
might
not
attend
;
"
and
walked
back
to
her
chair
,
recomposed
,
and
with
the
comfortable
hope
of
having
acquitted
herself
well
.
  
<EOS>
The
visitors
took
their
leave
;
and
Charles
,
having
civilly
seen
them
off
,
and
then
made
a
face
at
them
,
and
abused
them
for
coming
,
began
with
    
"
Well
,
mother
,
I
have
done
something
for
you
that
you
will
like
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
the
theatre
,
and
secured
a
box
for
to
-
morrow
night
.
<EOS>
A'n"t
<EOS>
I
a
good
boy
?
<EOS>
I
know
you
love
a
play
;
and
there
is
room
for
us
all
.
<EOS>
It
holds
nine
.
<EOS>
I
have
engaged
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
Anne
will
not
be
sorry
to
join
us
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
We
all
like
a
play
.
<EOS>
Have
not
I
done
well
,
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
was
good
humouredly
beginning
to
express
her
perfect
readiness
for
the
play
,
if
Henrietta
and
all
the
others
liked
it
,
when
Mary
eagerly
interrupted
her
by
exclaiming
    
"
Good
heavens
,
Charles
!
<EOS>
how
can
you
think
of
such
a
thing
?
<EOS>
Take
a
box
for
to
-
morrow
night
!
<EOS>
Have
you
forgot
that
we
are
engaged
to
Camden
Place
to
-
morrow
night
?
<EOS>
and
that
we
were
most
particularly
asked
to
meet
Lady
Dalrymple
and
her
daughter
,
and
Mr
Elliot
,
and
all
the
principal
family
connexions
,
on
purpose
to
be
introduced
to
them
?
<EOS>
How
can
you
be
so
forgetful
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Phoo
!
phoo
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Charles
,
"
what
's
an
evening
party
?
<EOS>
Never
worth
remembering
.
<EOS>
Your
father
might
have
asked
us
to
dinner
,
I
think
,
if
he
had
wanted
to
see
us
.
<EOS>
You
may
do
as
you
like
,
but
I
shall
go
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
Charles
,
I
declare
it
will
be
too
abominable
if
you
do
,
when
you
promised
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
did
not
promise
.
<EOS>
I
only
smirked
and
bowed
,
and
said
the
word
"
happy
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
no
promise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
go
,
Charles
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
unpardonable
to
fail
.
<EOS>
We
were
asked
on
purpose
to
be
introduced
.
<EOS>
There
was
always
such
a
great
connexion
between
the
Dalrymples
and
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Nothing
ever
happened
on
either
side
that
was
not
announced
immediately
.
<EOS>
We
are
quite
near
relations
,
you
know
;
and
Mr
Elliot
too
,
whom
you
ought
so
particularly
to
be
acquainted
with
!
<EOS>
Every
attention
is
due
to
Mr
Elliot
.
<EOS>
Consider
,
my
father
's
heir
:
the
future
representative
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
about
heirs
and
representatives
,
"
cried
Charles
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
one
of
those
who
neglect
the
reigning
power
to
bow
to
the
rising
sun
.
<EOS>
If
I
would
not
go
for
the
sake
of
your
father
,
I
should
think
it
scandalous
to
go
for
the
sake
of
his
heir
.
<EOS>
What
is
Mr
Elliot
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
The
careless
expression
was
life
to
Anne
,
who
saw
that
Captain
Wentworth
was
all
attention
,
looking
and
listening
with
his
whole
soul
;
and
that
the
last
words
brought
his
enquiring
eyes
from
Charles
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
and
Mary
still
talked
on
in
the
same
style
<EOS>
;
he
,
half
serious
and
half
jesting
,
maintaining
the
scheme
for
the
play
,
and
she
,
invariably
serious
,
most
warmly
opposing
it
,
and
not
omitting
to
make
it
known
that
,
however
determined
to
go
to
Camden
Place
herself
,
she
should
not
think
herself
very
well
used
,
if
they
went
to
the
play
without
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
put
it
off
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
you
had
much
better
go
back
and
change
the
box
for
Tuesday
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
pity
to
be
divided
,
and
we
should
be
losing
Miss
Anne
,
too
,
if
there
is
a
party
at
her
father
's
;
and
I
am
sure
neither
Henrietta
nor
I
should
care
at
all
for
the
play
,
if
Miss
Anne
could
not
be
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
felt
truly
obliged
to
her
for
such
kindness
;
and
quite
as
much
so
for
the
opportunity
it
gave
her
of
decidedly
saying
    
"
If
it
depended
only
on
my
inclination
,
ma'am
,
the
party
at
home
(
excepting
on
Mary
's
account
)
would
not
be
the
smallest
impediment
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
pleasure
in
the
sort
of
meeting
,
and
should
be
too
happy
to
change
it
for
a
play
,
and
with
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
it
had
better
not
be
attempted
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
"
She
had
spoken
it
;
but
she
trembled
when
it
was
done
,
conscious
that
her
words
were
listened
to
,
and
daring
not
even
to
try
to
observe
their
effect
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
soon
generally
agreed
that
Tuesday
should
be
the
day
;
Charles
only
reserving
the
advantage
of
still
teasing
his
wife
,
by
persisting
that
he
would
go
to
the
play
to
-
morrow
if
nobody
else
would
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
left
his
seat
,
and
walked
to
the
fire
-
place
;
probably
for
the
sake
of
walking
away
from
it
soon
afterwards
,
and
taking
a
station
,
with
less
bare
-
faced
design
,
by
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
been
long
enough
in
Bath
,
"
said
he
,
"
to
enjoy
the
evening
parties
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
no
.
<EOS>
The
usual
character
of
them
has
nothing
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
card
-
player
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
were
not
formerly
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
You
did
not
use
to
like
cards
;
but
time
makes
many
changes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
yet
so
much
changed
,
"
cried
Anne
,
and
stopped
,
fearing
she
hardly
knew
what
misconstruction
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
a
few
moments
he
said
,
and
as
if
it
were
the
result
of
immediate
feeling
,
"
It
is
a
period
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Eight
years
and
a
half
is
a
period
.
"
  
<EOS>
Whether
he
would
have
proceeded
farther
was
left
to
Anne
's
imagination
to
ponder
over
in
a
calmer
hour
;
for
while
still
hearing
the
sounds
he
had
uttered
,
she
was
startled
to
other
subjects
by
Henrietta
,
eager
to
make
use
of
the
present
leisure
for
getting
out
,
and
calling
on
her
companions
to
lose
no
time
,
lest
somebody
else
should
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
obliged
to
move
.
<EOS>
Anne
talked
of
being
perfectly
ready
,
and
tried
to
look
it
;
but
she
felt
that
could
Henrietta
have
known
the
regret
and
reluctance
of
her
heart
in
quitting
that
chair
,
in
preparing
to
quit
the
room
,
she
would
have
found
,
in
all
her
own
sensations
for
her
cousin
,
in
the
very
security
of
his
affection
,
wherewith
to
pity
her
.
  
<EOS>
Their
preparations
,
however
,
were
stopped
short
.
<EOS>
Alarming
sounds
were
heard
;
other
visitors
approached
,
and
the
door
was
thrown
open
for
Sir
Walter
and
Miss
Elliot
,
whose
entrance
seemed
to
give
a
general
chill
.
<EOS>
Anne
felt
an
instant
oppression
,
and
wherever
she
looked
saw
symptoms
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
The
comfort
,
the
freedom
,
the
gaiety
of
the
room
was
over
,
hushed
into
cold
composure
,
determined
silence
,
or
insipid
talk
,
to
meet
the
heartless
elegance
of
her
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
How
mortifying
to
feel
that
it
was
so
!
  
<EOS>
Her
jealous
eye
was
satisfied
in
one
particular
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
was
acknowledged
again
by
each
,
by
Elizabeth
more
graciously
than
before
.
<EOS>
She
even
addressed
him
once
,
and
looked
at
him
more
than
once
.
<EOS>
Elizabeth
was
,
in
fact
,
revolving
a
great
measure
.
<EOS>
The
sequel
explained
it
.
<EOS>
After
the
waste
of
a
few
minutes
in
saying
the
proper
nothings
,
she
began
to
give
the
invitation
which
was
to
comprise
all
the
remaining
dues
of
the
Musgroves
.
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
evening
,
to
meet
a
few
friends
:
no
formal
party
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
said
very
gracefully
,
and
the
cards
with
which
she
had
provided
herself
,
the
"
Miss
Elliot
at
home
,
"
were
laid
on
the
table
,
with
a
courteous
,
comprehensive
smile
to
all
,
and
one
smile
and
one
card
more
decidedly
for
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
that
Elizabeth
had
been
long
enough
in
Bath
to
understand
the
importance
of
a
man
of
such
an
air
and
appearance
as
his
.
<EOS>
The
past
was
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
present
was
that
Captain
Wentworth
would
move
about
well
in
her
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
card
was
pointedly
given
,
and
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
arose
and
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
The
interruption
had
been
short
,
though
severe
,
and
ease
and
animation
returned
to
most
of
those
they
left
as
the
door
shut
them
out
,
but
not
to
Anne
.
<EOS>
She
could
think
only
of
the
invitation
she
had
with
such
astonishment
witnessed
,
and
of
the
manner
in
which
it
had
been
received
;
a
manner
of
doubtful
meaning
,
of
surprise
rather
than
gratification
,
of
polite
acknowledgement
rather
than
acceptance
.
<EOS>
She
knew
him
;
she
saw
disdain
in
his
eye
,
and
could
not
venture
to
believe
that
he
had
determined
to
accept
such
an
offering
,
as
an
atonement
for
all
the
insolence
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
Her
spirits
sank
.
<EOS>
He
held
the
card
in
his
hand
after
they
were
gone
,
as
if
deeply
considering
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
think
of
Elizabeth
's
including
everybody
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Mary
very
audibly
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wonder
Captain
Wentworth
is
delighted
!
<EOS>
You
see
he
can
not
put
the
card
out
of
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
caught
his
eye
,
saw
his
cheeks
glow
,
and
his
mouth
form
itself
into
a
momentary
expression
of
contempt
,
and
turned
away
,
that
she
might
neither
see
nor
hear
more
to
vex
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
party
separated
.
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
had
their
own
pursuits
,
the
ladies
proceeded
on
their
own
business
,
and
they
met
no
more
while
Anne
belonged
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
was
earnestly
begged
to
return
and
dine
,
and
give
them
all
the
rest
of
the
day
,
but
her
spirits
had
been
so
long
exerted
that
at
present
she
felt
unequal
to
more
,
and
fit
only
for
home
,
where
she
might
be
sure
of
being
as
silent
as
she
chose
.
  
<EOS>
Promising
to
be
with
them
<EOS>
the
whole
of
the
following
morning
,
therefore
,
she
closed
the
fatigues
of
the
present
by
a
toilsome
walk
to
Camden
Place
,
there
to
spend
the
evening
chiefly
in
listening
to
the
busy
arrangements
of
Elizabeth
and
Mrs
Clay
for
the
morrow
's
party
,
the
frequent
enumeration
of
the
persons
invited
,
and
the
continually
improving
detail
of
all
the
embellishments
which
were
to
make
it
the
most
completely
elegant
of
its
kind
in
Bath
,
while
harassing
herself
with
the
never
-
ending
question
,
of
whether
Captain
Wentworth
would
come
or
not
?
<EOS>
They
were
reckoning
him
as
certain
,
but
with
her
it
was
a
gnawing
solicitude
never
appeased
for
five
minutes
together
.
<EOS>
She
generally
thought
he
would
come
,
because
she
generally
thought
he
ought
;
but
it
was
a
case
which
she
could
not
so
shape
into
any
positive
act
of
duty
or
discretion
,
as
inevitably
to
defy
the
suggestions
of
very
opposite
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
She
only
roused
herself
from
the
broodings
of
this
restless
agitation
,
to
let
Mrs
Clay
know
that
she
had
been
seen
with
Mr
Elliot
three
hours
after
his
being
supposed
to
be
out
of
Bath
,
for
having
watched
in
vain
for
some
intimation
of
the
interview
from
the
lady
herself
,
she
determined
to
mention
it
,
and
it
seemed
to
her
there
was
guilt
in
Mrs
Clay
's
face
as
she
listened
.
<EOS>
It
was
transient
:
cleared
away
in
an
instant
;
but
Anne
could
imagine
she
read
there
the
consciousness
of
having
,
by
some
complication
of
mutual
trick
,
or
some
overbearing
authority
of
his
,
been
obliged
to
attend
(
perhaps
for
half
an
hour
)
to
his
lectures
and
restrictions
on
her
designs
on
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
She
exclaimed
,
however
,
with
a
very
tolerable
imitation
of
nature
:
    
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
dear
!
<EOS>
very
true
.
<EOS>
Only
think
,
Miss
Elliot
,
to
my
great
surprise
I
met
with
Mr
Elliot
in
Bath
Street
.
<EOS>
I
was
never
more
astonished
.
<EOS>
He
turned
back
and
walked
with
me
to
the
Pump
Yard
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
prevented
setting
off
for
Thornberry
,
but
I
really
forget
by
what
;
for
I
was
in
a
hurry
,
and
could
not
much
attend
,
and
I
can
only
answer
for
his
being
determined
not
to
be
delayed
in
his
return
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
know
how
early
he
might
be
admitted
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
was
full
of
"
to
-
morrow
,
"
and
it
is
very
evident
that
I
have
been
full
of
it
too
,
ever
since
I
entered
the
house
,
and
learnt
the
extension
of
your
plan
and
all
that
had
happened
,
or
my
seeing
him
could
never
have
gone
so
entirely
out
of
my
head
.
"
    
<EOS>
One
day
only
had
passed
since
Anne
's
conversation
with
Mrs
Smith
;
but
a
keener
interest
had
succeeded
,
and
she
was
now
so
little
touched
by
Mr
Elliot
's
conduct
,
except
by
its
effects
in
one
quarter
,
that
it
became
a
matter
of
course
the
next
morning
,
still
to
defer
her
explanatory
visit
in
Rivers
Street
.
<EOS>
She
had
promised
to
be
with
the
Musgroves
from
breakfast
to
dinner
.
<EOS>
Her
faith
was
plighted
,
and
Mr
Elliot
's
character
,
like
the
Sultaness
Scheherazade
's
head
,
must
live
another
day
.
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
keep
her
appointment
punctually
,
however
;
the
weather
was
unfavourable
,
and
she
had
grieved
over
the
rain
on
her
friends
'
account
,
and
felt
it
very
much
on
her
own
,
before
she
was
able
to
attempt
the
walk
.
<EOS>
When
she
reached
the
White
Hart
,
and
made
her
way
to
the
proper
apartment
,
she
found
herself
neither
arriving
quite
in
time
,
nor
the
first
to
arrive
.
<EOS>
The
party
before
her
were
,
Mrs
Musgrove
,
talking
to
Mrs
Croft
,
and
Captain
Harville
to
Captain
Wentworth
;
and
she
immediately
heard
that
Mary
and
Henrietta
,
too
impatient
to
wait
,
had
gone
out
the
moment
it
had
cleared
,
but
would
be
back
again
soon
,
and
that
the
strictest
injunctions
had
been
left
with
Mrs
Musgrove
to
keep
her
there
till
they
returned
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
to
submit
,
sit
down
,
be
outwardly
composed
,
and
feel
herself
plunged
at
once
in
all
the
agitations
which
she
had
merely
laid
her
account
of
tasting
a
little
before
the
morning
closed
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
delay
,
no
waste
of
time
.
<EOS>
She
was
deep
in
the
happiness
of
such
misery
,
or
the
misery
of
such
happiness
,
instantly
.
<EOS>
Two
minutes
after
her
entering
the
room
,
Captain
Wentworth
said
    
"
We
will
write
the
letter
we
were
talking
of
,
Harville
,
now
,
if
you
will
give
me
materials
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Materials
were
at
hand
,
on
a
separate
table
;
he
went
to
it
,
and
nearly
turning
his
back
to
them
all
,
was
engrossed
by
writing
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
was
giving
Mrs
Croft
the
history
of
her
eldest
daughter
's
engagement
,
and
just
in
that
inconvenient
tone
of
voice
which
was
perfectly
audible
while
it
pretended
to
be
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
Anne
felt
that
she
did
not
belong
to
the
conversation
,
and
yet
,
as
Captain
Harville
seemed
thoughtful
and
not
disposed
to
talk
,
she
could
not
avoid
hearing
many
undesirable
particulars
;
such
as
,
"
how
Mr
Musgrove
and
my
brother
Hayter
had
met
again
and
again
to
talk
it
over
;
what
my
brother
Hayter
had
said
one
day
,
and
what
Mr
Musgrove
had
proposed
the
next
,
and
what
had
occurred
to
my
sister
Hayter
,
and
what
the
young
people
had
wished
,
and
what
I
said
at
first
I
never
could
consent
to
,
but
was
afterwards
persuaded
to
think
might
do
very
well
,
"
and
a
great
deal
in
the
same
style
of
open
-
hearted
communication
:
minutiae
which
,
even
with
every
advantage
of
taste
and
delicacy
,
which
good
Mrs
Musgrove
could
not
give
,
could
be
properly
interesting
only
to
the
principals
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
was
attending
with
great
good
-
humour
,
and
whenever
she
spoke
at
all
,
it
was
very
sensibly
.
<EOS>
Anne
hoped
the
gentlemen
might
each
be
too
much
self
-
occupied
to
hear
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
ma'am
,
all
these
thing
considered
,
"
said
Mrs
Musgrove
,
in
her
powerful
whisper
,
"
though
we
could
have
wished
it
different
,
yet
,
altogether
,
we
did
not
think
it
fair
to
stand
out
any
longer
,
for
Charles
Hayter
was
quite
wild
about
it
,
and
Henrietta
was
pretty
near
as
bad
;
and
<EOS>
so
we
thought
they
had
better
marry
at
once
,
and
make
the
best
of
it
,
as
many
others
have
done
before
them
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
said
I
,
it
will
be
better
than
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
precisely
what
I
was
going
to
observe
,
"
cried
Mrs
Croft
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
have
young
people
settle
on
a
small
income
at
once
,
and
have
to
struggle
with
a
few
difficulties
together
,
than
be
involved
in
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
I
always
think
that
no
mutual
 
"
  
"
Oh
!
dear
Mrs
Croft
,
"
cried
Mrs
Musgrove
,
unable
to
let
her
finish
her
speech
,
"
there
is
nothing
I
so
abominate
for
young
people
as
a
long
engagement
.
<EOS>
It
is
what
I
always
protested
against
for
my
children
.
<EOS>
It
is
all
very
well
,
I
used
to
say
,
for
young
people
to
be
engaged
,
if
there
is
a
certainty
of
their
being
able
to
marry
in
six
months
,
or
even
in
twelve
;
but
a
long
engagement
 
"
  
"
Yes
,
dear
ma'am
,
"
said
Mrs
Croft
,
"
or
an
uncertain
engagement
,
an
engagement
which
may
be
long
.
<EOS>
To
begin
without
knowing
that
at
such
a
time
there
will
be
the
means
of
marrying
,
I
hold
to
be
very
unsafe
and
unwise
,
and
what
I
think
all
parents
should
prevent
as
far
as
they
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
found
an
unexpected
interest
here
.
<EOS>
She
felt
its
application
to
herself
,
felt
it
in
a
nervous
thrill
all
over
her
;
and
at
the
same
moment
that
her
eyes
instinctively
glanced
towards
the
distant
table
,
Captain
Wentworth
's
pen
ceased
to
move
,
his
head
was
raised
,
pausing
,
listening
,
and
he
turned
round
the
next
instant
to
give
a
look
,
one
quick
,
conscious
look
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
ladies
continued
to
talk
,
to
re
-
urge
the
same
admitted
truths
,
and
enforce
them
with
such
examples
of
the
ill
effect
of
a
contrary
practice
as
had
fallen
within
their
observation
,
but
Anne
heard
nothing
distinctly
;
it
was
only
a
buzz
of
words
in
her
ear
,
her
mind
was
in
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
,
who
had
in
truth
been
hearing
none
of
it
,
now
left
his
seat
,
and
moved
to
a
window
,
and
Anne
seeming
to
watch
him
,
though
it
was
from
thorough
absence
of
mind
,
became
gradually
sensible
that
he
was
inviting
her
to
join
him
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
,
and
a
little
motion
of
the
head
,
which
expressed
,
"
Come
to
me
,
I
have
something
to
say
;
"
and
the
unaffected
,
easy
kindness
of
manner
which
denoted
the
feelings
of
an
older
acquaintance
than
he
really
was
,
strongly
enforced
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
She
roused
herself
and
went
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
window
at
which
he
stood
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
from
where
the
two
ladies
were
sitting
,
and
though
nearer
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
table
,
not
very
near
.
<EOS>
As
she
joined
him
,
Captain
Harville
's
countenance
re
-
assumed
the
serious
,
thoughtful
expression
which
seemed
its
natural
character
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
"
said
he
,
unfolding
a
parcel
in
his
hand
,
and
displaying
a
small
miniature
painting
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
know
who
that
is
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
:
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
you
may
guess
who
it
is
for
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
(
in
a
deep
tone
,
)
"
it
was
not
done
for
her
.
<EOS>
Miss
Elliot
,
do
you
remember
our
walking
together
at
Lyme
,
and
grieving
for
him
?
<EOS>
I
little
thought
then
 
but
no
matter
.
<EOS>
This
was
drawn
at
the
Cape
.
<EOS>
He
met
with
a
clever
young
German
artist
at
the
Cape
,
and
in
compliance
with
a
promise
to
my
poor
sister
,
sat
to
him
,
and
was
bringing
it
home
for
her
;
and
I
have
now
the
charge
of
getting
it
properly
set
for
another
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
commission
to
me
!
<EOS>
But
who
else
was
there
to
employ
?
<EOS>
I
hope
I
can
allow
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sorry
,
indeed
,
to
make
it
over
to
another
.
<EOS>
He
undertakes
it
;
"
(
looking
towards
Captain
Wentworth
,
)
"
he
is
writing
about
it
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
quivering
lip
he
wound
up
the
whole
by
adding
,
"
Poor
Fanny
!
<EOS>
she
would
not
have
forgotten
him
so
soon
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
replied
Anne
,
in
a
low
,
feeling
voice
.
<EOS>
"
That
I
can
easily
believe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
in
her
nature
.
<EOS>
She
doted
on
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
would
not
be
the
nature
of
any
woman
who
truly
loved
.
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
smiled
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Do
you
claim
that
for
your
sex
?
"
and
she
answered
the
question
,
smiling
also
,
"
Yes
.
<EOS>
We
certainly
do
not
forget
you
as
soon
as
you
forget
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
perhaps
,
our
fate
rather
than
our
merit
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
help
ourselves
.
<EOS>
We
live
at
home
,
quiet
,
confined
,
and
our
feelings
prey
upon
us
.
<EOS>
You
are
forced
on
exertion
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
a
profession
,
pursuits
,
business
of
some
sort
or
other
,
to
take
you
back
into
the
world
immediately
,
and
continual
occupation
and
change
soon
weaken
impressions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Granting
your
assertion
that
the
world
does
all
this
so
soon
for
men
(
which
,
however
,
I
do
not
think
I
shall
grant
)
,
it
does
not
apply
to
Benwick
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
been
forced
upon
any
exertion
.
<EOS>
The
peace
turned
him
on
shore
at
the
very
moment
,
and
he
has
been
living
with
us
,
in
our
little
family
circle
,
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
very
true
;
I
did
not
recollect
;
but
what
shall
we
say
now
,
Captain
Harville
?
<EOS>
If
the
change
be
not
from
outward
circumstances
,
it
must
be
from
within
;
it
must
be
nature
,
man
's
nature
,
which
has
done
the
business
for
Captain
Benwick
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
it
is
not
man
's
nature
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
it
to
be
more
man
's
nature
than
woman
's
to
be
inconstant
and
forget
those
they
do
love
,
or
have
loved
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
a
true
analogy
between
our
bodily
frames
and
our
mental
;
and
that
as
our
bodies
are
the
strongest
,
so
are
our
feelings
;
capable
of
bearing
most
rough
usage
,
and
riding
out
the
heaviest
weather
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
feelings
may
be
the
strongest
,
"
replied
Anne
,
"
but
the
same
spirit
of
analogy
will
authorise
me
to
assert
that
ours
are
the
most
tender
.
<EOS>
Man
is
more
robust
than
woman
,
but
he
is
not
longer
lived
;
which
exactly
explains
my
view
of
the
nature
of
their
attachments
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
it
would
be
too
hard
upon
you
,
if
it
were
otherwise
.
<EOS>
You
have
difficulties
,
and
privations
,
and
dangers
enough
to
struggle
with
.
<EOS>
You
are
always
labouring
and
toiling
,
exposed
to
every
risk
and
hardship
.
<EOS>
Your
home
,
country
,
friends
,
all
quitted
.
<EOS>
Neither
time
,
nor
health
,
nor
life
,
to
be
called
your
own
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hard
,
indeed
"
(
with
a
faltering
voice
)
,
"
if
woman
's
feelings
were
to
be
added
to
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
never
agree
upon
this
question
,
"
Captain
Harville
was
beginning
to
say
,
when
a
slight
noise
called
their
attention
to
Captain
Wentworth
's
hitherto
perfectly
quiet
division
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
more
than
that
his
pen
had
fallen
down
;
but
Anne
was
startled
at
finding
him
nearer
than
she
had
supposed
,
and
half
inclined
to
suspect
that
the
pen
had
only
fallen
because
he
had
been
occupied
by
them
,
striving
to
catch
sounds
,
which
yet
she
did
not
think
he
could
have
caught
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
finished
your
letter
?
"
said
Captain
Harville
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
quite
,
a
few
lines
more
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
done
in
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
hurry
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
ready
whenever
you
are
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
very
good
anchorage
here
,
"
(
smiling
at
Anne
,
)
"
well
supplied
,
and
want
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
No
hurry
for
a
signal
at
all
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Elliot
,
"
(
lowering
his
voice
,
)
"
as
I
was
saying
we
shall
never
agree
,
I
suppose
,
upon
this
point
.
<EOS>
No
man
and
woman
,
would
,
probably
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
observe
that
all
histories
are
against
you
 
all
stories
,
prose
and
verse
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
such
a
memory
as
Benwick
,
I
could
bring
you
fifty
quotations
in
a
moment
on
my
side
the
argument
,
and
I
do
not
think
I
ever
opened
a
book
in
my
life
which
had
not
something
to
say
upon
woman
's
inconstancy
.
<EOS>
Songs
and
proverbs
,
all
talk
of
woman
's
fickleness
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
will
say
,
these
were
all
written
by
men
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
shall
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
if
you
please
,
no
reference
to
examples
in
books
.
<EOS>
Men
have
had
every
advantage
of
us
in
telling
their
own
story
.
<EOS>
Education
has
been
theirs
in
so
much
higher
a
degree
;
the
pen
has
been
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
allow
books
to
prove
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
shall
we
prove
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
never
shall
.
<EOS>
We
never
can
expect
to
prove
any
thing
upon
such
a
point
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
difference
of
opinion
which
does
not
admit
of
proof
.
<EOS>
We
each
begin
,
probably
,
with
a
little
bias
towards
our
own
sex
;
and
upon
that
bias
build
every
circumstance
in
favour
of
it
which
has
occurred
within
our
own
circle
;
many
of
which
circumstances
(
perhaps
those
very
cases
which
strike
us
the
most
)
may
be
precisely
such
as
can
not
be
brought
forward
without
betraying
a
confidence
,
or
in
some
respect
saying
what
should
not
be
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
"
cried
Captain
Harville
,
in
a
tone
of
strong
feeling
,
"
if
I
could
but
make
you
comprehend
what
a
man
suffers
when
he
takes
a
last
look
at
his
wife
and
children
,
and
watches
the
boat
that
he
has
sent
them
off
in
,
as
long
as
it
is
in
sight
,
and
then
turns
away
and
says
,
"
God
knows
whether
we
ever
meet
again
!
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
I
could
convey
to
you
the
glow
of
his
soul
when
he
does
see
them
again
;
when
,
coming
back
after
a
twelvemonth
's
absence
,
perhaps
,
and
obliged
to
put
into
another
port
,
he
calculates
how
soon
it
be
possible
to
get
them
there
,
pretending
to
deceive
himself
,
and
saying
,
"
They
can
not
be
here
till
such
a
day
,
"
but
all
the
while
hoping
for
them
twelve
hours
sooner
,
and
seeing
them
arrive
at
last
,
as
if
Heaven
had
given
them
wings
,
by
many
hours
sooner
still
!
<EOS>
If
I
could
explain
to
you
all
this
,
and
all
that
a
man
can
bear
and
do
,
and
glories
to
do
,
for
the
sake
of
these
treasures
of
his
existence
!
<EOS>
I
speak
,
you
know
,
only
of
such
men
as
have
hearts
!
"
<EOS>
pressing
his
own
with
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
Anne
eagerly
,
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
do
justice
to
all
that
is
felt
by
you
,
and
by
those
who
resemble
you
.
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
undervalue
the
warm
and
faithful
feelings
of
any
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
!
<EOS>
I
should
deserve
utter
contempt
if
I
dared
to
suppose
that
true
attachment
and
constancy
were
known
only
by
woman
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
believe
you
capable
of
everything
great
and
good
in
your
married
lives
.
<EOS>
I
believe
you
equal
to
every
important
exertion
,
and
to
every
domestic
forbearance
,
so
long
as
 
if
I
may
be
allowed
the
expression
 
so
long
as
you
have
an
object
.
<EOS>
I
mean
while
the
woman
you
love
lives
,
and
lives
for
you
.
<EOS>
All
the
privilege
I
claim
for
my
own
sex
(
it
is
not
a
very
enviable
one
;
you
need
not
covet
it
)
,
is
that
of
loving
longest
,
when
existence
or
when
hope
is
gone
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
immediately
have
uttered
another
sentence
;
her
heart
was
too
full
,
her
breath
too
much
oppressed
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
good
soul
,
"
cried
Captain
Harville
,
putting
his
hand
on
her
arm
,
quite
affectionately
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
quarrelling
with
you
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
think
of
Benwick
,
my
tongue
is
tied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Their
attention
was
called
towards
the
others
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
was
taking
leave
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Frederick
,
you
and
I
part
company
,
I
believe
,
"
said
she
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
home
,
and
you
have
an
engagement
with
your
friend
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
we
may
have
the
pleasure
of
all
meeting
again
at
your
party
,
"
(
turning
to
Anne
.
)
<EOS>
"
We
had
your
sister
's
card
yesterday
,
and
I
understood
Frederick
had
a
card
too
,
though
I
did
not
see
it
;
and
you
are
disengaged
,
Frederick
,
are
you
not
,
as
well
as
ourselves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
was
folding
up
a
letter
in
great
haste
,
and
either
could
not
or
would
not
answer
fully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
he
,
"
very
true
;
here
we
separate
,
but
Harville
and
I
shall
soon
be
after
you
;
that
is
,
Harville
,
if
you
are
ready
,
I
am
in
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
not
be
sorry
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
at
your
service
in
half
a
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Croft
left
them
,
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
having
sealed
his
letter
with
great
rapidity
,
was
indeed
ready
,
and
had
even
a
hurried
,
agitated
air
,
which
shewed
impatience
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
Anne
knew
not
how
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
the
kindest
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
,
God
bless
you
!
"
<EOS>
from
Captain
Harville
,
but
from
him
not
a
word
,
nor
a
look
!
<EOS>
He
had
passed
out
of
the
room
without
a
look
!
  
<EOS>
She
had
only
time
,
however
,
to
move
closer
to
the
table
where
he
had
been
writing
,
when
footsteps
were
heard
returning
;
the
door
opened
,
it
was
himself
.
<EOS>
He
begged
their
pardon
,
but
he
had
forgotten
his
gloves
,
and
instantly
crossing
the
room
to
the
writing
table
,
he
drew
out
a
letter
from
under
the
scattered
paper
,
placed
it
before
Anne
with
eyes
of
glowing
entreaty
fixed
on
her
for
a
time
,
and
hastily
collecting
his
gloves
,
was
again
out
of
the
room
,
almost
before
Mrs
Musgrove
was
aware
of
his
being
in
it
:
the
work
of
an
instant
!
  
<EOS>
The
revolution
which
one
instant
had
made
in
Anne
,
was
almost
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
The
letter
,
with
a
direction
hardly
legible
,
to
"
Miss
A.
E.
 
,
"
was
evidently
the
one
which
he
had
been
folding
so
hastily
.
<EOS>
While
supposed
to
be
writing
only
to
Captain
Benwick
,
he
had
been
also
addressing
her
!
<EOS>
On
the
contents
of
that
letter
depended
all
which
this
world
could
do
for
her
.
<EOS>
Anything
was
possible
,
anything
might
be
defied
rather
than
suspense
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Musgrove
had
little
arrangements
of
her
own
at
her
own
table
;
to
their
protection
she
must
trust
,
and
sinking
into
the
chair
which
he
had
occupied
,
succeeding
to
the
very
spot
where
he
had
leaned
and
written
,
her
eyes
devoured
the
following
words
:
  
"
<EOS>
I
can
listen
no
longer
in
silence
.
<EOS>
I
must
speak
to
you
by
such
means
as
are
within
my
reach
.
<EOS>
You
pierce
my
soul
.
<EOS>
I
am
half
agony
,
half
hope
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
not
that
I
am
too
late
,
that
such
precious
feelings
are
gone
for
ever
.
<EOS>
I
offer
myself
to
you
again
with
a
heart
even
more
your
own
than
when
you
almost
broke
it
,
eight
years
and
a
half
ago
.
<EOS>
Dare
not
say
that
man
forgets
sooner
than
woman
,
that
his
love
has
an
earlier
death
.
<EOS>
I
have
loved
none
but
you
.
<EOS>
Unjust
<EOS>
I
may
have
been
,
weak
and
resentful
I
have
been
,
but
never
inconstant
.
<EOS>
You
alone
have
brought
me
to
Bath
.
<EOS>
For
you
alone
,
I
think
and
plan
.
<EOS>
Have
you
not
seen
this
?
<EOS>
Can
you
fail
to
have
understood
my
wishes
?
<EOS>
I
had
not
waited
even
these
ten
days
,
could
I
have
read
your
feelings
,
as
I
think
you
must
have
penetrated
mine
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
write
.
<EOS>
I
am
every
instant
hearing
something
which
overpowers
me
.
<EOS>
You
sink
your
voice
,
but
I
can
distinguish
the
tones
of
that
voice
when
they
would
be
lost
on
others
.
<EOS>
Too
good
,
too
excellent
creature
!
<EOS>
You
do
us
justice
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
You
do
believe
that
there
is
true
attachment
and
constancy
among
men
.
<EOS>
Believe
it
to
be
most
fervent
,
most
undeviating
,
in
F.
W.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
,
uncertain
of
my
fate
;
but
I
shall
return
hither
,
or
follow
your
party
,
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
A
word
,
a
look
,
will
be
enough
to
decide
whether
I
enter
your
father
's
house
this
evening
or
never
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
a
letter
was
not
to
be
soon
recovered
from
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
's
solitude
and
reflection
might
have
tranquillized
her
;
but
the
ten
minutes
only
which
now
passed
before
she
was
interrupted
,
with
all
the
restraints
of
her
situation
,
could
do
nothing
towards
tranquillity
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
rather
brought
fresh
agitation
.
<EOS>
It
was
overpowering
happiness
.
<EOS>
And
before
she
was
beyond
the
first
stage
of
full
sensation
,
Charles
,
Mary
,
and
Henrietta
all
came
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
absolute
necessity
of
seeming
like
herself
produced
then
an
immediate
struggle
;
but
after
a
while
she
could
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
began
not
to
understand
a
word
they
said
,
and
was
obliged
to
plead
indisposition
and
excuse
herself
.
<EOS>
They
could
then
see
that
she
looked
very
ill
,
were
shocked
and
concerned
,
and
would
not
stir
without
her
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
This
was
dreadful
.
<EOS>
Would
they
only
have
gone
away
,
and
left
her
in
the
quiet
possession
of
that
room
it
would
have
been
her
cure
;
but
to
have
them
all
standing
or
waiting
around
her
was
distracting
,
and
in
desperation
,
she
said
she
would
go
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
my
dear
,
"
cried
Mrs
Musgrove
,
"
go
home
directly
,
and
take
care
of
yourself
,
that
you
may
be
fit
for
the
evening
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Sarah
was
here
to
doctor
you
,
but
I
am
no
doctor
myself
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
ring
and
order
a
chair
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
walk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
chair
would
never
do
.
<EOS>
Worse
than
all
!
<EOS>
To
lose
the
possibility
of
speaking
two
words
to
Captain
Wentworth
in
the
course
of
her
quiet
,
solitary
progress
up
the
town
(
and
she
felt
almost
certain
of
meeting
him
)
could
not
be
borne
.
<EOS>
The
chair
was
earnestly
protested
against
,
and
Mrs
Musgrove
,
who
thought
only
of
one
sort
of
illness
,
having
assured
herself
with
some
anxiety
,
that
there
had
been
no
fall
in
the
case
;
that
Anne
had
not
at
any
time
lately
slipped
down
,
and
got
a
blow
on
her
head
;
that
she
was
perfectly
convinced
of
having
had
no
fall
;
could
part
with
her
cheerfully
,
and
depend
on
finding
her
better
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
Anxious
to
omit
no
possible
precaution
,
Anne
struggled
,
and
said
    
"
I
am
afraid
,
ma'am
,
that
it
is
not
perfectly
understood
.
<EOS>
Pray
be
so
good
as
to
mention
to
the
other
gentlemen
that
we
hope
to
see
your
whole
party
this
evening
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
there
had
been
some
mistake
;
and
I
wish
you
particularly
to
assure
Captain
Harville
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
that
we
hope
to
see
them
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
it
is
quite
understood
,
I
give
you
my
word
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
has
no
thought
but
of
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
;
and
I
should
be
so
very
sorry
.
<EOS>
Will
you
promise
me
to
mention
it
,
when
you
see
them
again
?
<EOS>
You
will
see
them
both
this
morning
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
Do
promise
me
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
To
be
sure
I
will
,
if
you
wish
it
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
if
you
see
Captain
Harville
anywhere
,
remember
to
give
Miss
Anne
's
message
.
<EOS>
But
indeed
,
my
dear
,
you
need
not
be
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Captain
Harville
holds
himself
quite
engaged
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
the
same
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
Anne
could
do
no
more
;
but
her
heart
prophesied
some
mischance
to
damp
the
perfection
of
her
felicity
.
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
very
lasting
,
however
.
<EOS>
Even
if
he
did
not
come
to
Camden
Place
himself
,
it
would
be
in
her
power
to
send
an
intelligible
sentence
by
Captain
Harville
.
<EOS>
Another
momentary
vexation
occurred
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
in
his
real
concern
and
good
nature
,
would
go
home
with
her
;
there
was
no
preventing
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
almost
cruel
.
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
be
long
ungrateful
;
he
was
sacrificing
an
engagement
at
a
gunsmith
's
,
to
be
of
use
to
her
;
and
she
set
off
with
him
,
with
no
feeling
but
gratitude
apparent
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
on
Union
Street
,
when
a
quicker
step
behind
,
a
something
of
familiar
sound
,
gave
her
two
moments
'
preparation
for
the
sight
of
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
He
joined
them
;
but
,
as
if
irresolute
whether
to
join
or
to
pass
on
,
said
nothing
,
only
looked
.
<EOS>
Anne
could
command
herself
enough
to
receive
that
look
,
and
not
repulsively
.
<EOS>
The
cheeks
which
had
been
pale
now
glowed
,
and
the
movements
which
had
hesitated
were
decided
.
<EOS>
He
walked
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
,
Charles
said
    
"
Captain
Wentworth
,
which
way
are
you
going
?
<EOS>
Only
to
Gay
Street
,
or
farther
up
the
town
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
,
"
replied
Captain
Wentworth
,
surprised
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
as
high
as
Belmont
?
<EOS>
Are
you
going
near
Camden
Place
?
<EOS>
Because
,
if
you
are
,
I
shall
have
no
scruple
in
asking
you
to
take
my
place
,
and
give
Anne
your
arm
to
her
father
's
door
.
<EOS>
She
is
rather
done
for
this
morning
,
and
must
not
go
so
far
without
help
,
and
I
ought
to
be
at
that
fellow
's
in
the
Market
Place
.
<EOS>
He
promised
me
the
sight
of
a
capital
gun
<EOS>
he
is
just
going
to
send
off
;
said
he
would
keep
it
unpacked
to
the
last
possible
moment
,
that
I
might
see
it
;
and
if
I
do
not
turn
back
now
,
I
have
no
chance
.
<EOS>
By
his
description
,
a
good
deal
like
the
second
size
double
-
barrel
of
mine
,
which
you
shot
with
one
day
round
Winthrop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
could
not
be
an
objection
.
<EOS>
There
could
be
only
the
most
proper
alacrity
,
a
most
obliging
compliance
for
public
view
;
and
smiles
reined
in
and
spirits
dancing
in
private
rapture
.
<EOS>
In
half
a
minute
Charles
was
at
the
bottom
of
Union
Street
again
,
and
the
other
two
proceeding
together
:
and
soon
words
enough
had
passed
between
them
to
decide
their
direction
towards
the
comparatively
quiet
and
retired
gravel
walk
,
where
the
power
of
conversation
would
make
the
present
hour
a
blessing
indeed
,
and
prepare
it
for
all
the
immortality
which
the
happiest
recollections
of
their
own
future
lives
could
bestow
.
<EOS>
There
they
exchanged
again
those
feelings
and
those
promises
which
had
once
before
seemed
to
secure
everything
,
but
which
had
been
followed
by
so
many
,
many
years
of
division
and
estrangement
.
<EOS>
There
they
returned
again
into
the
past
,
more
exquisitely
happy
,
perhaps
,
in
their
re
-
union
,
than
when
it
had
been
first
projected
;
more
tender
,
more
tried
,
more
fixed
in
a
knowledge
of
each
other
's
character
,
truth
,
and
attachment
;
more
equal
to
act
,
more
justified
in
acting
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
as
they
slowly
paced
the
gradual
ascent
,
heedless
of
every
group
around
them
,
seeing
neither
sauntering
politicians
,
bustling
housekeepers
,
flirting
girls
,
nor
nursery
-
maids
and
children
,
they
could
indulge
in
those
retrospections
and
acknowledgements
,
and
especially
in
those
explanations
of
what
had
directly
preceded
the
present
moment
,
which
were
so
poignant
and
so
ceaseless
in
interest
.
<EOS>
All
the
little
variations
of
the
last
week
were
gone
through
;
and
of
yesterday
and
today
there
could
scarcely
be
an
end
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
not
mistaken
him
.
<EOS>
Jealousy
of
Mr
Elliot
had
been
the
retarding
weight
,
the
doubt
,
the
torment
.
<EOS>
That
had
begun
to
operate
in
the
very
hour
of
first
meeting
her
in
Bath
;
that
had
returned
,
after
a
short
suspension
,
to
ruin
the
concert
;
and
that
had
influenced
him
in
everything
he
had
said
and
done
,
or
omitted
to
say
and
do
,
in
the
last
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
gradually
yielding
to
the
better
hopes
which
her
looks
,
or
words
,
or
actions
occasionally
encouraged
;
it
had
been
vanquished
at
last
by
those
sentiments
and
those
tones
which
had
reached
him
while
she
talked
with
Captain
Harville
;
and
under
the
irresistible
governance
of
which
he
had
seized
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
poured
out
his
feelings
.
  
<EOS>
Of
what
he
had
then
written
,
nothing
was
to
be
retracted
or
qualified
.
<EOS>
He
persisted
in
having
loved
none
but
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
been
supplanted
.
<EOS>
He
never
even
believed
himself
to
see
her
equal
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
indeed
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
:
that
he
had
been
constant
unconsciously
,
nay
unintentionally
;
that
he
had
meant
to
forget
her
,
and
believed
it
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
He
had
imagined
himself
indifferent
,
when
he
had
only
been
angry
;
and
he
had
been
unjust
to
her
merits
,
because
he
had
been
a
sufferer
from
them
.
<EOS>
Her
character
was
now
fixed
on
his
mind
as
perfection
itself
,
maintaining
the
loveliest
medium
of
fortitude
and
gentleness
;
but
he
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
only
at
Uppercross
had
he
learnt
to
do
her
justice
,
and
only
at
Lyme
<EOS>
had
he
begun
to
understand
himself
.
<EOS>
At
Lyme
,
he
had
received
lessons
of
more
than
one
sort
.
<EOS>
The
passing
admiration
of
Mr
Elliot
had
at
least
roused
him
,
and
the
scenes
on
the
Cobb
and
at
Captain
Harville
's
had
fixed
her
superiority
.
  
<EOS>
In
his
preceding
attempts
to
attach
himself
to
Louisa
Musgrove
(
the
attempts
of
angry
pride
)
,
he
protested
that
he
had
for
ever
felt
it
to
be
impossible
;
that
he
had
not
cared
,
could
not
care
,
for
Louisa
;
though
till
that
day
,
till
the
leisure
for
reflection
which
followed
it
,
he
had
not
understood
the
perfect
excellence
of
the
mind
with
which
Louisa
's
could
so
ill
bear
a
comparison
,
or
the
perfect
unrivalled
hold
it
possessed
over
his
own
.
<EOS>
There
,
he
had
learnt
to
distinguish
between
the
steadiness
of
principle
and
the
obstinacy
of
self
-
will
,
between
the
darings
of
heedlessness
and
the
resolution
of
a
collected
mind
.
<EOS>
There
he
had
seen
everything
to
exalt
in
his
estimation
the
woman
he
had
lost
;
and
there
begun
to
deplore
the
pride
,
the
folly
,
the
madness
of
resentment
,
which
had
kept
him
from
trying
to
regain
her
when
thrown
in
his
way
.
  
<EOS>
From
that
period
his
penance
had
become
severe
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
been
free
from
the
horror
and
remorse
attending
the
first
few
days
of
Louisa
's
accident
,
no
sooner
begun
to
feel
himself
alive
again
,
than
he
had
begun
to
feel
himself
,
though
alive
,
not
at
liberty
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
I
was
considered
by
Harville
an
engaged
man
!
<EOS>
That
neither
Harville
nor
his
wife
entertained
a
doubt
of
our
mutual
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
was
startled
and
shocked
.
<EOS>
To
a
degree
,
I
could
contradict
this
instantly
;
but
,
when
I
began
to
reflect
that
others
might
have
felt
the
same
 
<EOS>
her
own
family
,
nay
,
perhaps
herself
 
<EOS>
I
was
no
longer
at
my
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
was
hers
in
honour
if
she
wished
it
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
unguarded
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
thought
seriously
on
this
subject
before
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
considered
that
my
excessive
intimacy
must
have
its
danger
of
ill
consequence
in
many
ways
;
and
that
I
had
no
right
to
be
trying
whether
I
could
attach
myself
to
either
of
the
girls
,
at
the
risk
of
raising
even
an
unpleasant
report
,
were
there
no
other
ill
effects
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
grossly
wrong
,
and
must
abide
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
found
too
late
,
in
short
,
that
he
had
entangled
himself
;
and
that
precisely
as
he
became
fully
satisfied
of
his
not
caring
for
Louisa
at
all
,
he
must
regard
himself
as
bound
to
her
,
if
her
sentiments
for
him
were
what
the
Harvilles
supposed
.
<EOS>
It
determined
him
to
leave
Lyme
,
and
await
her
complete
recovery
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
He
would
gladly
weaken
,
by
any
fair
means
,
whatever
feelings
or
speculations
concerning
him
might
exist
;
and
he
went
,
therefore
,
to
his
brother
's
,
meaning
after
a
while
to
return
to
Kellynch
,
and
act
as
circumstances
might
require
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
six
weeks
with
Edward
,
"
said
he
,
"
and
saw
him
happy
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
no
other
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
deserved
none
.
<EOS>
He
enquired
after
you
very
particularly
;
asked
even
if
you
were
personally
altered
,
little
suspecting
that
to
my
eye
you
could
never
alter
.
"
  
<EOS>
Anne
smiled
,
and
let
it
pass
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
pleasing
a
blunder
for
a
reproach
.
<EOS>
It
is
something
for
a
woman
to
be
assured
,
in
her
eight
-
and
-
twentieth
year
,
that
she
has
not
lost
one
charm
of
earlier
youth
;
but
the
value
of
such
homage
was
inexpressibly
increased
to
Anne
,
by
comparing
it
with
former
words
,
and
feeling
it
to
be
the
result
,
not
the
cause
of
a
revival
of
his
warm
attachment
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
remained
in
Shropshire
,
lamenting
the
blindness
of
his
own
pride
,
and
the
blunders
of
his
own
calculations
,
till
at
once
released
from
Louisa
by
the
astonishing
and
felicitous
intelligence
of
her
engagement
with
Benwick
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
"
said
he
,
"
ended
the
worst
of
my
state
;
for
now
I
could
at
least
put
myself
in
the
way
of
happiness
;
I
could
exert
myself
;
I
could
do
something
.
<EOS>
But
to
be
waiting
so
long
in
inaction
,
and
waiting
only
for
evil
,
had
been
dreadful
.
<EOS>
Within
the
first
five
minutes
I
said
,
"
I
will
be
at
Bath
on
Wednesday
,
"
and
I
was
.
<EOS>
Was
it
unpardonable
to
think
it
worth
my
while
to
come
?
<EOS>
and
to
arrive
with
some
degree
of
hope
?
<EOS>
You
were
single
.
<EOS>
It
was
possible
that
you
might
retain
the
feelings
of
the
past
,
as
I
did
;
and
one
encouragement
happened
to
be
mine
.
<EOS>
I
could
never
doubt
that
you
would
be
loved
and
sought
by
others
,
but
I
knew
to
a
certainty
that
you
had
refused
one
man
,
at
least
,
of
better
pretensions
than
myself
;
and
I
could
not
help
often
saying
,
"
Was
this
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
Their
first
meeting
in
Milsom
Street
afforded
much
to
be
said
,
but
the
concert
still
more
.
<EOS>
That
evening
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
exquisite
moments
.
<EOS>
The
moment
of
her
stepping
forward
in
the
Octagon
Room
to
speak
to
him
:
the
moment
of
Mr
Elliot
's
appearing
and
tearing
her
away
,
and
one
or
two
subsequent
moments
,
marked
by
returning
hope
or
increasing
despondency
,
were
dwelt
on
with
energy
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
see
you
,
"
cried
he
,
"
in
the
midst
of
those
who
could
not
be
my
well
-
wishers
;
to
see
your
cousin
close
by
you
,
conversing
and
smiling
,
and
feel
all
the
horrible
eligibilities
and
proprieties
of
the
match
!
<EOS>
To
consider
it
as
the
certain
wish
of
every
being
who
could
hope
to
influence
you
!
<EOS>
Even
if
your
own
feelings
were
reluctant
or
indifferent
,
to
consider
what
powerful
supports
would
be
his
!
<EOS>
Was
it
not
enough
to
make
the
fool
of
me
which
I
appeared
?
<EOS>
How
could
I
look
on
without
agony
?
<EOS>
Was
not
the
very
sight
of
the
friend
who
sat
behind
you
,
was
not
the
recollection
of
what
had
been
<EOS>
,
the
knowledge
of
her
influence
,
the
indelible
,
immoveable
impression
of
what
persuasion
had
once
done
 
was
it
not
all
against
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
distinguished
,
"
replied
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
You
should
not
have
suspected
me
now
;
the
case
is
so
different
,
and
my
age
is
so
different
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
wrong
in
yielding
to
persuasion
once
,
remember
that
it
was
to
persuasion
exerted
on
the
side
of
safety
,
not
of
risk
.
<EOS>
When
I
yielded
,
I
thought
it
was
to
duty
,
but
no
duty
could
be
called
in
aid
here
.
<EOS>
In
marrying
a
man
indifferent
to
me
,
all
risk
would
have
been
incurred
,
and
all
duty
violated
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
ought
to
have
reasoned
thus
,
"
he
replied
,
"
but
I
could
not
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
derive
benefit
from
the
late
knowledge
I
had
acquired
of
your
character
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
bring
it
into
play
;
it
was
overwhelmed
,
buried
,
lost
in
those
earlier
feelings
which
I
had
been
smarting
under
year
after
year
.
<EOS>
I
could
think
of
you
only
as
one
who
had
yielded
,
who
had
given
me
up
,
who
had
been
influenced
by
any
one
rather
than
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
you
with
the
very
person
who
had
guided
you
in
that
year
of
misery
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
reason
to
believe
her
of
less
authority
now
.
<EOS>
The
force
of
habit
was
to
be
added
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
thought
,
"
said
Anne
,
"
that
my
manner
to
yourself
might
have
spared
you
much
or
all
of
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
your
manner
might
be
only
the
ease
which
your
engagement
to
another
man
would
give
.
<EOS>
I
left
you
in
this
belief
;
and
yet
,
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
see
you
again
.
<EOS>
My
spirits
rallied
with
the
morning
,
and
I
felt
that
I
had
still
a
motive
for
remaining
here
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
Anne
was
at
home
again
,
and
happier
than
any
one
in
that
house
could
have
conceived
.
<EOS>
All
the
surprise
and
suspense
,
and
every
other
painful
part
of
the
morning
dissipated
by
this
conversation
,
she
re
-
entered
the
house
so
happy
as
to
be
obliged
to
find
an
alloy
in
some
momentary
apprehensions
of
its
being
impossible
to
last
.
<EOS>
An
interval
of
meditation
,
serious
and
grateful
,
was
the
best
corrective
of
everything
dangerous
in
such
high
-
wrought
felicity
;
and
she
went
to
her
room
,
and
grew
steadfast
and
fearless
in
the
thankfulness
of
her
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
came
,
the
drawing
-
rooms
were
lighted
up
,
the
company
assembled
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
card
party
,
it
was
but
a
mixture
of
those
who
had
never
met
before
,
and
those
who
met
too
often
;
a
commonplace
business
,
too
numerous
for
intimacy
,
too
small
for
variety
;
but
Anne
had
never
found
an
evening
shorter
.
<EOS>
Glowing
and
lovely
in
sensibility
and
happiness
,
and
more
generally
admired
than
she
thought
about
or
cared
for
,
she
had
cheerful
or
forbearing
feelings
for
every
creature
around
her
.
<EOS>
Mr
Elliot
was
there
;
she
avoided
,
but
she
could
pity
him
.
<EOS>
The
Wallises
,
she
had
amusement
in
understanding
them
.
<EOS>
Lady
Dalrymple
and
Miss
Carteret
 
they
would
soon
be
innoxious
cousins
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
cared
not
for
Mrs
Clay
,
and
had
nothing
to
blush
for
in
the
public
manners
of
her
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
With
the
Musgroves
,
there
was
the
happy
chat
of
perfect
ease
;
with
Captain
Harville
,
the
kind
-
hearted
intercourse
of
brother
and
sister
;
with
Lady
Russell
,
attempts
at
conversation
,
which
a
delicious
consciousness
cut
short
;
with
Admiral
and
Mrs
Croft
,
everything
of
peculiar
cordiality
and
fervent
interest
,
which
the
same
consciousness
sought
to
conceal
;
and
with
Captain
Wentworth
,
some
moments
of
communications
continually
occurring
,
and
always
the
hope
of
more
,
and
always
the
knowledge
of
his
being
there
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
one
of
these
short
meetings
,
each
apparently
occupied
in
admiring
a
fine
display
of
greenhouse
plants
<EOS>
,
that
she
said
    
"
I
have
been
thinking
over
the
past
,
and
trying
impartially
to
judge
of
the
right
and
wrong
,
I
mean
with
regard
to
myself
;
and
I
must
believe
that
I
was
right
,
much
as
I
suffered
from
it
,
that
I
was
perfectly
right
in
being
guided
by
the
friend
whom
you
will
love
better
than
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
To
me
,
she
was
in
the
place
of
a
parent
.
<EOS>
Do
not
mistake
me
,
however
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
saying
that
she
did
not
err
in
her
advice
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
perhaps
,
one
of
those
cases
in
which
advice
is
good
or
bad
only
as
the
event
decides
;
and
for
myself
,
I
certainly
never
should
,
in
any
circumstance
of
tolerable
similarity
,
give
such
advice
.
<EOS>
But
I
mean
,
that
I
was
right
in
submitting
to
her
,
and
that
if
I
had
done
otherwise
,
I
should
have
suffered
more
in
continuing
the
engagement
than
I
did
even
in
giving
it
up
,
because
I
should
have
suffered
in
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
,
as
far
as
such
a
sentiment
is
allowable
in
human
nature
,
nothing
to
reproach
myself
with
;
and
if
I
mistake
not
,
a
strong
sense
of
duty
is
no
bad
part
of
a
woman
's
portion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
her
,
looked
at
Lady
Russell
,
and
looking
again
at
her
,
replied
,
as
if
in
cool
deliberation
    
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
hopes
of
her
being
forgiven
in
time
.
<EOS>
I
trust
to
being
in
charity
with
her
soon
.
<EOS>
But
I
too
have
been
thinking
over
the
past
,
and
a
question
has
suggested
itself
,
whether
there
may
not
have
been
one
person
more
my
enemy
even
than
that
lady
?
<EOS>
My
own
self
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
if
,
when
I
returned
to
England
in
the
year
eight
,
with
a
few
thousand
pounds
,
and
was
posted
into
the
Laconia
,
if
I
had
then
written
to
you
,
would
you
have
answered
my
letter
?
<EOS>
Would
you
,
in
short
,
have
renewed
the
engagement
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Would
I
!
"
was
all
her
answer
;
but
the
accent
was
decisive
enough
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
you
would
!
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
I
did
not
think
of
it
,
or
desire
it
,
as
what
could
alone
crown
all
my
other
success
;
but
I
was
proud
,
too
proud
to
ask
again
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
I
shut
my
eyes
,
and
would
not
understand
you
,
or
do
you
justice
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
recollection
which
ought
to
make
me
forgive
every
one
sooner
than
myself
.
<EOS>
Six
years
of
separation
and
suffering
might
have
been
spared
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sort
of
pain
,
too
,
which
is
new
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
used
to
the
gratification
of
believing
myself
to
earn
every
blessing
that
I
enjoyed
.
<EOS>
I
have
valued
myself
on
honourable
toils
and
just
rewards
.
<EOS>
Like
other
great
men
under
reverses
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
endeavour
to
subdue
my
mind
to
my
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
must
learn
to
brook
being
happier
than
I
deserve
.
"
    
<EOS>
Who
can
be
in
doubt
of
what
followed
?
<EOS>
When
any
two
young
people
take
it
into
their
heads
to
marry
,
they
are
pretty
sure
by
perseverance
to
carry
their
point
,
be
they
ever
so
poor
,
or
ever
so
imprudent
,
or
ever
so
little
likely
to
be
necessary
to
each
other
's
ultimate
comfort
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
bad
morality
to
conclude
with
,
but
I
believe
it
to
be
truth
;
and
if
such
parties
succeed
,
how
should
a
Captain
Wentworth
and
an
Anne
Elliot
,
with
the
advantage
of
maturity
of
mind
,
consciousness
of
right
,
and
one
independent
fortune
between
them
,
fail
of
bearing
down
every
opposition
?
<EOS>
They
might
in
fact
,
have
borne
down
a
great
deal
more
than
they
met
with
,
for
there
was
little
to
distress
them
beyond
the
want
of
graciousness
and
warmth
.
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
made
no
objection
,
and
Elizabeth
did
nothing
worse
than
look
cold
and
unconcerned
.
<EOS>
Captain
Wentworth
,
with
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
and
as
high
in
his
profession
as
merit
and
activity
could
place
him
,
was
no
longer
nobody
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
esteemed
quite
worthy
to
address
the
daughter
of
a
foolish
,
spendthrift
baronet
,
who
had
not
had
principle
or
sense
enough
to
maintain
himself
in
the
situation
in
which
Providence
had
placed
him
,
and
who
could
give
his
daughter
at
present
but
a
small
part
of
the
share
of
ten
thousand
pounds
which
must
be
hers
hereafter
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
,
indeed
,
though
he
had
no
affection
for
Anne
,
and
no
vanity
flattered
,
to
make
him
really
happy
on
the
occasion
,
was
very
far
from
thinking
it
a
bad
match
for
her
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
when
he
saw
more
of
Captain
Wentworth
,
saw
him
repeatedly
by
daylight
,
and
eyed
him
well
,
he
was
very
much
struck
by
his
personal
claims
,
and
felt
that
his
superiority
of
appearance
might
be
not
unfairly
balanced
against
her
superiority
of
rank
;
and
all
this
,
assisted
by
his
well
-
sounding
name
,
enabled
Sir
Walter
at
last
to
prepare
his
pen
,
with
a
very
good
grace
,
for
the
insertion
of
the
marriage
in
the
volume
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
one
among
them
,
whose
opposition
of
feeling
could
excite
any
serious
anxiety
was
Lady
Russell
.
<EOS>
Anne
knew
that
Lady
Russell
must
be
suffering
some
pain
in
understanding
and
relinquishing
Mr
Elliot
,
and
be
making
some
struggles
to
become
truly
acquainted
with
,
and
do
justice
to
Captain
Wentworth
.
<EOS>
This
however
was
what
Lady
Russell
had
now
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
must
learn
to
feel
that
she
had
been
mistaken
with
regard
to
both
;
that
she
had
been
unfairly
influenced
by
appearances
in
each
;
that
because
Captain
Wentworth
's
manners
had
not
suited
her
own
ideas
,
she
had
been
too
quick
in
suspecting
them
to
indicate
a
character
of
dangerous
impetuosity
;
and
that
because
Mr
Elliot
's
manners
had
precisely
pleased
her
in
their
propriety
and
correctness
,
their
general
politeness
and
suavity
,
she
had
been
too
quick
in
receiving
them
as
the
certain
result
of
the
most
correct
opinions
and
well
-
regulated
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
less
for
Lady
Russell
to
do
,
than
to
admit
that
she
had
been
pretty
completely
wrong
,
and
to
take
up
a
new
set
of
opinions
and
of
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
quickness
of
perception
in
some
,
a
nicety
in
the
discernment
of
character
,
a
natural
penetration
,
in
short
,
which
no
experience
in
others
can
equal
,
and
Lady
Russell
had
been
less
gifted
in
this
part
of
understanding
than
her
young
friend
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
a
very
good
woman
,
and
if
her
second
object
was
to
be
sensible
and
well
-
judging
,
her
first
was
to
see
Anne
happy
.
<EOS>
She
loved
Anne
better
than
she
loved
her
own
abilities
;
and
when
the
awkwardness
of
the
beginning
was
over
,
found
little
hardship
in
attaching
herself
as
a
mother
to
the
man
who
was
securing
the
happiness
of
her
other
child
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
family
,
Mary
was
probably
the
one
most
immediately
gratified
by
the
circumstance
.
<EOS>
It
was
creditable
to
have
a
sister
married
,
and
she
might
flatter
herself
with
having
been
greatly
instrumental
to
the
connexion
,
by
keeping
Anne
with
her
in
the
autumn
;
and
as
her
own
sister
must
be
better
than
her
husband
's
sisters
,
it
was
very
agreeable
that
Captain
Wentworth
should
be
a
richer
man
than
either
Captain
Benwick
or
Charles
Hayter
.
<EOS>
She
had
something
to
suffer
,
perhaps
,
when
they
came
into
contact
again
,
in
seeing
Anne
restored
to
the
rights
of
seniority
,
and
the
mistress
of
a
very
pretty
landaulette
;
but
she
had
a
future
to
look
forward
to
,
of
powerful
consolation
.
<EOS>
Anne
had
no
Uppercross
Hall
before
her
,
no
landed
estate
,
no
headship
of
a
family
;
and
if
they
could
but
keep
Captain
Wentworth
from
being
made
a
baronet
,
she
would
not
change
situations
with
Anne
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
be
well
for
the
eldest
sister
if
she
were
equally
satisfied
with
her
situation
,
for
a
change
is
not
very
probable
there
.
<EOS>
She
had
soon
the
mortification
of
seeing
Mr
Elliot
withdraw
,
and
no
one
of
proper
condition
has
since
presented
himself
to
raise
even
the
unfounded
hopes
which
sunk
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
of
his
cousin
Anne
's
engagement
burst
on
Mr
Elliot
most
unexpectedly
.
<EOS>
It
deranged
his
best
plan
of
domestic
happiness
,
his
best
hope
of
keeping
Sir
Walter
single
by
the
watchfulness
which
a
son
-
in
-
law
's
rights
would
have
given
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
discomfited
and
disappointed
,
he
could
still
do
something
for
his
own
interest
and
his
own
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
He
soon
quitted
Bath
;
and
on
Mrs
Clay
's
quitting
it
soon
afterwards
,
and
being
next
heard
of
as
established
under
his
protection
in
London
,
it
was
evident
how
double
a
game
he
had
been
playing
,
and
how
determined
he
was
to
save
himself
from
being
cut
out
by
one
artful
woman
,
at
least
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Clay
's
affections
had
overpowered
her
interest
,
and
she
had
sacrificed
,
for
the
young
man
's
sake
,
the
possibility
of
scheming
longer
for
Sir
Walter
.
<EOS>
She
has
abilities
,
however
,
as
well
as
affections
;
and
it
is
now
a
doubtful
point
whether
his
cunning
,
or
hers
,
may
finally
carry
the
day
;
whether
,
after
preventing
her
from
being
the
wife
of
Sir
Walter
,
he
may
not
be
wheedled
and
caressed
at
last
into
making
her
the
wife
of
Sir
William
.
  
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
doubted
that
Sir
Walter
and
Elizabeth
were
shocked
and
mortified
by
the
loss
of
their
companion
,
and
the
discovery
of
their
deception
in
her
.
<EOS>
They
had
their
great
cousins
,
to
be
sure
,
to
resort
to
for
comfort
;
but
they
must
long
feel
that
to
flatter
and
follow
others
,
without
being
flattered
and
followed
in
turn
,
is
but
a
state
of
half
enjoyment
.
  
<EOS>
Anne
,
satisfied
at
a
very
early
period
of
Lady
Russell
's
meaning
to
love
Captain
Wentworth
as
she
ought
,
had
no
other
alloy
to
the
happiness
of
her
prospects
than
what
arose
from
the
consciousness
of
having
no
relations
to
bestow
on
him
which
a
man
of
sense
could
value
.
<EOS>
There
she
felt
her
own
inferiority
very
keenly
.
<EOS>
The
disproportion
in
their
fortune
was
nothing
;
it
did
not
give
her
a
moment
's
regret
;
but
to
have
no
family
to
receive
and
estimate
him
properly
,
nothing
of
respectability
,
of
harmony
,
of
good
will
to
offer
in
return
for
all
the
worth
and
all
the
prompt
welcome
which
met
her
in
his
brothers
and
sisters
,
was
a
source
of
as
lively
pain
as
her
mind
could
well
be
sensible
of
under
circumstances
of
otherwise
strong
felicity
.
<EOS>
She
had
but
two
friends
in
the
world
to
add
to
his
list
,
Lady
Russell
and
Mrs
Smith
.
<EOS>
To
those
,
however
,
he
was
very
well
disposed
to
attach
himself
.
<EOS>
Lady
Russell
,
in
spite
of
all
her
former
transgressions
,
he
could
now
value
from
his
heart
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
not
obliged
to
say
that
he
believed
her
to
have
been
right
in
originally
dividing
them
,
he
was
ready
to
say
almost
everything
else
in
her
favour
,
and
as
for
Mrs
Smith
,
she
had
claims
of
various
kinds
to
recommend
her
quickly
and
permanently
.
  
<EOS>
Her
recent
good
offices
by
Anne
had
been
enough
in
themselves
,
and
their
marriage
,
instead
of
depriving
her
of
one
friend
,
secured
her
two
.
<EOS>
She
was
their
earliest
visitor
in
their
settled
life
;
and
Captain
Wentworth
,
by
putting
her
in
the
way
of
recovering
her
husband
's
property
in
the
West
Indies
,
by
writing
for
her
,
acting
for
her
,
and
seeing
her
through
all
the
petty
difficulties
of
the
case
with
the
activity
and
exertion
of
a
fearless
man
and
a
determined
friend
,
fully
requited
the
services
which
she
had
rendered
,
or
ever
meant
to
render
,
to
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Smith
's
enjoyments
were
not
spoiled
by
this
improvement
of
income
,
with
some
improvement
of
health
,
and
the
acquisition
of
such
friends
to
be
often
with
,
for
her
cheerfulness
and
mental
alacrity
did
not
fail
her
;
and
while
these
prime
supplies
of
good
remained
,
she
might
have
bid
defiance
even
to
greater
accessions
of
worldly
prosperity
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
been
absolutely
rich
and
perfectly
healthy
,
and
yet
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Her
spring
of
felicity
was
in
the
glow
of
her
spirits
,
as
her
friend
Anne
's
was
in
the
warmth
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Anne
was
tenderness
itself
,
and
she
had
the
full
worth
of
it
in
Captain
Wentworth
's
affection
.
<EOS>
His
profession
was
all
that
could
ever
make
her
friends
wish
that
tenderness
less
,
the
dread
of
a
future
war
all
that
could
dim
her
sunshine
.
<EOS>
She
gloried
in
being
a
sailor
's
wife
,
but
she
must
pay
the
tax
of
quick
alarm
for
belonging
to
that
profession
which
is
,
if
possible
,
more
distinguished
in
its
domestic
virtues
than
in
its
national
importance
.
