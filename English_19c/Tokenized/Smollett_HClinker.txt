Prologue
 
<EOS>
To
Mr

RESPECTED
SIR
,
  	
<EOS>
I
have
received
your
esteemed
favour
of
the
13th
ultimo
,
whereby
it
appeareth
,
that
you
have
perused
those
same
Letters
,
the
which
were
delivered
unto
you
by
my
friend
the
reverend
Mr
Hugo
Behn
;
and
I
am
pleased
to
find
you
think
they
may
be
printed
with
a
good
prospect
of
success
;
in
as
much
as
the
objections
you
mention
,
I
humbly
conceive
,
are
such
as
may
be
redargued
,
if
not
entirely
removed
  
And
,
first
,
in
the
first
place
,
as
touching
what
prosecutions
may
arise
from
printing
the
private
correspondence
of
persons
still
living
,
give
me
leave
,
with
all
due
submission
,
to
observe
,
that
the
Letters
in
question
were
not
written
and
sent
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
;
that
they
have
no
tendency
to
the
mala
fama
,
or
prejudice
of
any
person
whatsoever
;
but
rather
to
the
information
and
edification
of
Mankind
:
so
that
it
becometh
a
sort
of
duty
to
promulgate
them
in
usum
publicum
.
<EOS>
Besides
I
have
consulted
Mr
Davy
Higgins
,
an
eminent
attorney
of
this
place
,
who
,
after
due
inspection
and
consideration
,
declareth
,
That
he
doth
not
think
the
said
Letters
contain
any
matter
which
will
be
held
actionable
in
the
eye
of
the
law
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
if
you
and
I
should
come
to
a
right
understanding
,
I
do
declare
in
verbo
sacerdotis
,
that
in
case
of
any
such
prosecution
,
I
will
take
the
whole
upon
my
own
shoulders
,
even
quoad
fine
and
imprisonment
,
though
,
I
must
confess
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
care
to
undergo
flagellation
:
<EOS>
Tam
ad
turpitudinem
,
quam
ad
amaritudinem
poena
spectans
     
<EOS>
Secondly
,
concerning
the
personal
resentment
of
Mr
Justice
Lismahago
,
I
may
say
,
non
flocci
factio
     
<EOS>
I
would
not
willingly
vilipend
any
Christian
,
if
,
peradventure
,
he
deserveth
that
epithet
:
<EOS>
albeit
,
I
am
much
surprised
that
more
care
is
not
taken
to
exclude
from
the
commission
<EOS>
all
such
vagrant
foreigners
as
may
be
justly
suspected
of
disaffection
to
our
happy
constitution
,
in
church
and
state
   
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
be
so
uncharitable
,
as
to
affirm
positively
,
that
the
said
Lismahago
is
no
better
than
a
Jesuit
in
disguise
;
but
<EOS>
this
I
will
assert
and
maintain
,
totis
viribus
,
that
,
from
the
day
he
qualified
,
he
has
never
been
once
seen
intra
templi
parietes
,
that
is
to
say
,
within
the
parish
church
.
      
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
with
respect
to
what
passed
at
Mr
Kendal
's
table
,
when
the
said
Lismahago
was
so
brutal
in
his
reprehensions
,
I
must
inform
you
,
my
good
sir
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
retire
,
not
by
fear
arising
from
his
minatory
reproaches
,
which
,
as
I
said
above
,
I
value
not
of
a
rush
;
but
from
the
sudden
effect
produced
by
a
barbel
's
row
,
which
I
had
eaten
at
dinner
,
not
knowing
,
that
the
said
row
is
at
certain
seasons
violently
cathartic
,
as
Galen
observeth
in
his
chapter
peri
ichtos
.
      
<EOS>
Fourthly
,
and
lastly
,
with
reference
to
the
manner
in
which
I
got
possession
of
these
Letters
,
it
is
a
circumstance
that
concerns
my
own
conscience
only
;
sufficeth
it
<EOS>
to
say
,
I
have
fully
satisfied
the
parties
in
whose
custody
they
were
;
and
,
by
this
time
,
I
hope
I
have
also
satisfied
you
in
such
ways
,
that
the
last
hand
may
be
put
to
our
agreement
,
and
the
work
proceed
with
all
convenient
expedition
;
in
which
hope
I
rest
,
      
respected
sir
,
your
very
humble
servant
,
      
Jonathan
Dustwich
.
      
<EOS>
PS
<EOS>
I
propose
,
Deo
Volente
,
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
in
the
great
city
,
towards
All
-
hallow
-
tide
,
when
I
shall
be
glad
to
treat
with
you
concerning
a
parcel
of
MS
sermons
,
of
a
certain
clergyman
deceased
;
a
cake
of
the
right
leaven
,
for
the
present
taste
of
the
public
.

To
the
Revd
Mr
Jonathan
Dustwich
,
at

Sir
,
   
<EOS>
I
Received
yours
in
course
of
post
,
and
shall
be
glad
to
treat
with
you
for
the
MS
which
I
have
delivered
to
your
friend
Mr
Behn
;
but
can
by
no
means
comply
with
the
terms
proposed
.
<EOS>
Those
things
are
<EOS>
so
uncertain
 
Writing
is
all
a
lottery
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
loser
by
the
works
of
the
greatest
men
of
the
age
 
<EOS>
I
could
mention
particulars
,
and
name
names
;
but
do
n't
choose
it
 
<EOS>
The
taste
of
the
town
is
so
changeable
.
<EOS>
Then
there
have
been
so
many
letters
upon
travels
lately
published
 
<EOS>
What
between
Smollett
's
,
Sharp
's
,
Derrick
's
,
Thickness
's
,
Baltimore
's
,
and
Baretti
's
,
together
with
Shandy
's
Sentimental
Travels
,
the
public
seems
to
be
cloyed
with
that
kind
of
entertainment
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
will
,
if
you
please
,
run
the
risque
of
printing
and
publishing
,
and
you
shall
have
half
the
profits
of
the
impression
 
You
need
not
take
the
trouble
to
bring
up
your
sermons
on
my
account
 
<EOS>
No
body
reads
sermons
but
Methodists
and
Dissenters
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
am
quite
a
stranger
to
that
sort
of
reading
;
and
the
two
persons
,
whose
judgment
I
depended
upon
in
these
matters
,
are
out
of
the
way
;
one
is
gone
abroad
,
carpenter
of
a
man
of
war
;
and
the
other
has
been
silly
enough
to
abscond
,
in
order
to
avoid
a
prosecution
for
blasphemy
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
great
loser
by
his
going
off
 
<EOS>
He
has
left
a
manual
of
devotion
half
finished
on
my
hands
,
after
having
received
money
for
the
whole
copy
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
soundest
divine
,
and
had
the
most
orthodox
pen
of
all
my
people
;
and
I
never
knew
his
judgment
fail
,
but
in
flying
from
his
bread
and
butter
on
this
occasion
.
      
<EOS>
By
owning
you
was
not
put
in
bodily
fear
by
Lismahago
,
you
preclude
yourself
from
the
benefit
of
a
good
plea
,
over
and
above
the
advantage
of
binding
him
over
.
<EOS>
In
the
late
war
,
I
inserted
in
my
evening
paper
,
a
paragraph
that
came
by
the
post
,
reflecting
upon
the
behaviour
of
a
certain
regiment
in
battle
.
<EOS>
An
officer
of
said
regiment
came
to
my
shop
,
and
,
in
the
presence
of
my
wife
and
journeyman
,
threatened
to
cut
off
my
ears
  
<EOS>
As
I
exhibited
marks
of
bodily
fears
,
more
ways
than
one
,
to
the
conviction
of
the
bye
-
standers
,
I
bound
him
over
;
my
action
lay
,
and
I
recovered
.
<EOS>
As
for
flagellation
,
you
have
nothing
to
fear
,
and
nothing
to
hope
,
on
that
head
 
There
has
been
but
one
printer
flogged
at
the
cart
's
tail
these
thirty
years
;
that
was
Charles
Watson
;
and
he
assured
me
it
was
no
more
than
a
flea
-
bite
.
<EOS>
C

#
#
S
#
#
#
#
has
been
threatened
several
times
by
the
House
of
L
#
#
#
#
;
but
it
came
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
If
an
information
should
be
moved
for
,
and
granted
against
you
,
as
the
editor
of
those
Letters
,
I
hope
you
will
have
honesty
and
wit
enough
to
appear
and
take
your
trial
 
If
you
should
be
sentenced
to
the
pillory
,
your
fortune
is
made
 
<EOS>
As
times
go
,
that
's
a
sure
step
to
honour
and
preferment
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
myself
happy
if
I
can
lend
you
a
lift
;
and
am
,
very
sincerely
,
      
yours

Please
my
kind
service
to
your

,
my
cousin
Madoc

<EOS>
I
have
sent
an
Almanack

Court

kalendar
,
directed
for
him
at
Mr
Sutton
's
bookseller
,
in
Gloucester
,
carriage
paid

which
he
will
please
to
accept
as
a
small
token
of
my
regard
.
<EOS>
My
wife
,
who
is
very
fond
of
toasted
cheese
,
presents
her
compliments
to
him
,
and
begs
to
know
if
there
's
any
of
that
kind
,
which
he
was
so
good
as
to
send
us
last
Christmas
,
to
be
sold
in
London

<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
    
Doctor
,
The
pills
are
good
for
nothing
 
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
swallow
snow
-
balls
to
cool
my
reins
 
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
over
and
over
,
how
hard
I
am
to
move
;
and
at
this
time
of
day
,
I
ought
to
know
something
of
my
own
constitution
.
<EOS>
Why
will
you
be
so
positive
?
<EOS>
Prithee
send
me
another
prescription
 
<EOS>
I
am
as
lame
<EOS>
and
as
much
tortured
in
all
my
limbs
as
if
I
was
broke
upon
the
wheel
:
indeed
,
I
am
equally
distressed
in
mind
and
body
 
<EOS>
As
if
I
had
not
plagues
enough
of
my
own
,
those
children
of
my
sister
are
left
me
for
a
perpetual
source
of
vexation
  
what
business
have
people
to
get
children
to
plague
their
neighbours
?
<EOS>
A
ridiculous
incident
that
happened
yesterday
to
my
niece
Liddy
,
has
disordered
me
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
expect
to
be
laid
up
with
another
sit
of
the
gout
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
I
may
explain
myself
in
my
next
.
<EOS>
I
shall
set
out
to
-
morrow
morning
for
the
Hot
-
Well
at
Bristol
,
where
I
am
afraid
I
shall
stay
longer
than
I
could
wish
.
<EOS>
On
the
receipt
of
this
,
send
Williams
thither
with
my
saddle
-
horse
and
the
demi
pique
.
<EOS>
Tell
Barns
to
thresh
out
the
two
old
ricks
,
and
send
the
corn
to
market
,
and
sell
it
off
to
the
poor
at
a
shilling
a
bushel
under
market
price

<EOS>
I
have
received
a
snivelling
letter
from
Griffin
,
offering
to
make
a
public
submission
and
pay
costs
<EOS>
I
want
none
of
his
submissions
;
neither
will
I
pocket
any
of
his
money
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
is
a
bad
neighhour
,
and
I
desire
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
:
<EOS>
but
as
he
is
purse
-
proud
,
he
shall
pay
for
his
insolence
:
let
him
give
five
pounds
to
the
poor
of
the
parish
,
and
I
'll
withdraw
my
action
;
and
in
the
mean
time
you
may
tell
Prig
to
stop
proceedings

Let
Morgan

a
syllable

her
pay
when

HEAVING

this
importunity

I
send
my
love
to
you
and
Saul
,
being
in
good
health
,
and
hoping
to
heer
the

you

that
you
and

will
take
my
poor
kitten

you
this
cold

<EOS>
We
have
been
all
in
a
sad
taking
here
at
Glostar
 
<EOS>
Miss
Liddy
had
like
to
have
run
away
with
a
player
-
man
,
and
young
master
<EOS>
and
he
would
adone
themselves
a
mischief
;
but
the
squire
applied
to
the
mare
,
and
they
were
bound
over
.
  
<EOS>
Mistress
bid
me
not
speak
a
word
of
the
matter
to
any
Christian
soul
 
<EOS>
no
more
I
shall
:
for
we
servints
should
see
all
and
say
nothing
 
<EOS>
But

DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
AS
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
at
heart
than
to
convince
you
I
am
incapable
of
forgetting
,
or
neglecting
the
friendship
I
made
at
college
<EOS>
,
I
now
begin
that
correspondence
by
letters
,
which
you
and
I
agreed
,
at
parting
,
to
cultivate
.
<EOS>
I
begin
it
sooner
than
I
intended
,
that
you
may
have
it
in
your
power
to
refute
any
idle
reports
which
may
be
circulated
to
my
prejudice
at
Oxford
,
touching
a
foolish
quarrel
,
in
which
I
have
been
involved
on
account
of
my
sister
,
who
had
been
some
time
settled
here
in
a
boarding
-
school
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
came
hither
with
my
uncle
and
aunt
(
who
are
our
guardians
)
to
fetch
her
away
,
I
found
her
a
fine
,
tall
girl
,
of
seventeen
,
with
an
agreeable
person
;
but
remarkably
simple
,
and
quite
ignorant
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
This
disposition
,
and
want
of
experience
,
had
exposed
her
to
the
addresses
of
a
person
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
call
him
who
had
seen
her
at
a
play
;
and
,
with
a
confidence
and
dexterity
peculiar
to
himself
,
found
means
to
be
recommended
to
her
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
the
greatest
accident
I
intercepted
one
of
his
letters
;
as
it
was
my
duty
to
stifle
this
correspondence
in
its
birth
,
I
made
it
my
business
to
find
him
out
,
and
tell
him
very
freely
my
sentiments
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
spark
did
not
like
the
stile
I
used
,
and
behaved
with
abundance
of
mettle
.
<EOS>
Though
his
rank
in
life
which
,
by
the
bye
,
I
am
ashamed
to
declare
)
did
not
entitle
him
to
much
deference
;
yet
as
his
behaviour
was
remarkably
spirited
,
I
admitted
him
to
the
privilege
of
a
gentleman
,
and
something
might
have
happened
,
had
not
we
been
prevented
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
business
took
air
,
I
know
not
how
,
and
made
abundance
of
noise
 
recourse
was
had
to
justice
 
I
was
obliged
to
give
my
word
and
honour
,
&
c.
and
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
we
set
out
for
Bristol
Wells
,
where
I
expect
to
hear
from
you
by
the
return
of
the
post
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
got
into
a
family
of
originals
,
whom
I
may
one
day
attempt
to
describe
for
your
amusement
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
is
a
maiden
of
forty
-
five
,
exceedingly
starched
,
vain
,
and
ridiculous
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
an
odd
kind
of
humorist
,
always
on
the
fret
,
and
so
unpleasant
in
his
manner
,
that
,
rather
than
be
obliged
to
keep
him
company
,
I
'd
resign
all
claim
to
the
inheritance
of
his
estate
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
his
being
tortured
by
the
gout
may
have
soured
his
temper
,
and
,
perhaps
,
I
may
like
him
better
on
further
acquaintance
:
<EOS>
certain
it
is
,
all
his
servants
and
neighbours
in
the
country
,
are
fond
of
him
,
even
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
the
reason
of
which
I
can
not
as
yet
comprehend
.
<EOS>
Remember
me
to
Griffy
Price
,
Gwyn
,
Mansel
,
Basset
,
and
all
the
rest
of
my
old
Cambrian
companions
.
  
<EOS>
Salute
the

maker
in
my
name
 
give
my
service
to
the

and
pray
take
care

poor
Ponto
,
for
the
sake
of
his
old
master
,
who
is
,
and
ever
will
be

<EOS>
DEAR
MADAM
,
HAVING
no
mother
of
my
own
<EOS>
,
I
hope
you
will
give
me
leave
to
disburthen
my
poor
heart
to
you
,
who
have
always
acted
the
part
of
a
kind
parent
to
me
,
ever
since
I
was
put
under
your
care
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
and
indeed
,
my
worthy
governess
may
believe
me
,
when
I
assure
her
,
that
I
never
harboured
a
thought
that
was
otherwise
than
virtuous
;
and
,
if
God
will
give
me
grace
,
I
shall
never
behave
so
as
to
cast
a
reflection
on
the
care
you
have
taken
in
my
education
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
given
just
cause
of
offence
by
my
want
of
prudence
and
experience
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
listened
to
what
the
young
man
said
;
and
it
was
my
duty
to
have
told
you
all
that
passed
,
but
I
was
ashamed
to
mention
it
;
and
then
he
behaved
so
modest
and
respectful
,
and
seemed
to
be
so
melancholy
and
timorous
,
that
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
do
any
thing
that
should
make
him
miserable
and
desperate
.
<EOS>
As
for
familiarities
,
I
do
declare
,
I
never
once
allowed
him
the
favour
of
a
salute
;
and
as
to
the
few
letters
that
passed
between
us
,
they
are
all
in
my
uncle
's
hands
,
and
I
hope
they
contain
nothing
contrary
to
innocence
and
honour
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
still
persuaded
that
he
is
not
what
he
appears
to
be
:
but
time
will
discover
 
mean
while
I
will
endeavour
to
forget
a
connexion
,
which
is
so
displeasing
to
my
family
.
<EOS>
I
have
cried
without
ceasing
,
and
have
not
tasted
any
thing
but
tea
,
since
I
was
harried
away
from
you
;
nor
did
I
once
close
my
eyes
for
three
nights
running
.
  
<EOS>
My
aunt
continues
to
chide
me
severely
when
we
are
by
ourselves
;
but
I
hope
to
soften
her
in
time
,
by
humility
and
submission
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
was
so
dreadfully
passionate
in
the
beginning
,
has
been
moved
by
my
tears
and
distress
;
and
is
now
all
tenderness
and
compassion
;
and
my
brother
is
reconciled
to
me
,
on
my
promise
to
break
off
all
correspondence
with
that
unfortunate
youth
:
but
,
notwithstanding
all
their
indulgence
,
I
shall
have
no
peace
of
mind
till
I
know
my
dear
and
ever
honoured
governess
has
forgiven
her
poor
,
disconsolate
,
forlorn
,
    
Affectionate
humble
servant

death

MY
DEAREST
LETTY
,
I
AM
in
such
a
fright
,
lest
this
should
not
come
safe
to
hand
by
the
conveyance
of
Jarvis
the
carrier
,
that
I
beg
you
will
write
to
me
,
on
the
receipt
of
it
,
directing
to
me
,
under
cover
,
to
Mrs
Winifred
Jerkins
,
my
aunt
's
maid
,
who
is
a
good
girl
,
and
has
been
so
kind
to
me
in
my
affliction
,
that
I
have
made
her
my
confidant
;
as
for
Jarvis
,
he
was
very
shy
of
taking
charge
of
my
letter
and
the
little
parcel
,
because
his
sister
Sally
had
like
to
have
lost
her
place
on
my
account
:
<EOS>
indeed
I
can
not
blame
the
man
for
his
caution
;
but
I
have
made
it
worth
his
while
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
companion
and
bed
-
fellow
,
it
is
a
grievous
addition
to
my
other
misfortunes
,
that
I
am
deprived
of
your
agreeable
company
and
conversation
,
at
a
time
when
I
need
so
much
the
comfort
of
your
good
humour
and
good
sense
;
but
,
I
hope
,
the
friendship
we
contracted
at
the
boarding
-
school
,
will
last
for
life
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
on
my
side
it
will
daily
increase
and
improve
,
as
I
gain
experience
,
and
learn
to
know
the
value
of
a
true
friend
.
  
<EOS>
O
,
my
dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
about
poor
Mr
Wilson
?
<EOS>
I
have
promised
to
break
off
all
correspondence
,
and
,
if
possible
,
to
forget
him
:
<EOS>
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
perceive
that
will
not
be
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
by
no
means
proper
that
the
picture
should
remain
in
my
hands
,
lest
it
should
be
the
occasion
of
more
mischief
,
I
have
sent
it
to
you
by
this
opportunity
,
begging
you
will
either
keep
it
safe
till
better
times
,
or
return
it
to
Mr
Wilson
himself
,
who
,
I
suppose
,
will
make
it
his
business
to
see
you
at
the
usual
place
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
be
low
-
spirited
at
my
sending
back
his
picture
,
you
may
tell
him
I
have
no
occasion
for
a
picture
,
while
the
original
continues
engraved
on
my
 
<EOS>
But
no
<EOS>
;
I
would
not
have
you
tell
him
that
neither
;
because
there
must
be
an
end
of
our
correspondence
  
<EOS>
I
wish
he
may
forget
me
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
peace
;
and
yet
if
he
should
,
he
must
be
a
barbarous
  
<EOS>
But
'
tis
impossible
 
poor
Wilson
can
not
be
false
and
inconstant
:
I
beseech
him
not
to
write
to
me
,
nor
attempt
to
see
me
for
some
time
;
for
,
considering
the
resentment
and
passionate
temper
of
my
brother
Jery
,
such
an
attempt
might
be
attended
with
consequences
which
would
make
us
all
miserable
for
life
 
<EOS>
let
us
trust
to
time
and
the
chapter
of
accidents
;
or
rather
to
that
Providence
which
will
not
fail
,
sooner
or
later
,
to
reward
those
that
walk
in
the
paths
of
honour
and
virtue
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
offer
my
love
to
the
young
ladies
:
but
it
is
not
fit
that
any
of
them
should
know
you
have
received
this
letter
.
  
<EOS>
If
we
go
to
Bath
,
I
shall
send
you
my
simple
remarks
upon
that
famous
centre
of
polite
amusement
,
and
every
other
place
we
may
chance
to
visit

and
I
flatter
myself
that
my

will
be
punctual
in
answering
the

<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
I
HAVE
followed
your
directions
with
some
success
,
and
might
have
been
upon
my
legs
by
this
time
,
<EOS>
had
the
weather
permitted
me
to
use
my
saddle
horse
.
<EOS>
I
rode
out
upon
the
Downs
last
Tuesday
,
in
the
forenoon
,
when
the
sky
,
as
far
as
the
visible
horizon
,
was
without
a
cloud
:
but
before
I
had
gone
a
full
mile
,
I
was
overtaken
instantaneously
by
a
storm
of
rain
that
wet
me
to
the
skin
in
three
minutes
 
whence
<EOS>
it
came
the
devil
knows
;
but
it
has
laid
me
up
(
I
suppose
for
one
fortnight
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
sick
to
hear
people
talk
of
the
fine
air
upon
Clifton
-
Downs
:
how
can
the
air
be
either
agreeable
or
salutary
,
where
the
daemon
of
vapours
descends
in
a
perpetual
drizzle
?
<EOS>
My
confinement
is
the
more
intolerable
,
as
I
am
surrounded
with
domestic
vexations
.
  
<EOS>
My
niece
has
had
a
dangerous
fit
of
illness
,
occasioned
by
that
cursed
incident
at
Gloucester
,
which
I
mentioned
in
my
last
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
a
poor
good
-
natured
simpleton
,
as
soft
as
butter
,
and
as
easily
melted
 
<EOS>
not
that
she
's
a
fool
 
<EOS>
the
girl
's
parts
are
not
despicable
,
and
her
education
has
not
been
neglected
;
that
is
to
say
,
she
can
write
and
spell
,
and
speak
French
,
and
play
upon
the
harpsichord
;
then
she
dances
finely
,
has
a
good
figure
,
and
is
very
well
inclined
;
but
,
she
's
deficient
in
spirit
,
and
so
susceptible
 
and
so
tender
forsooth
!
  
<EOS>
truly
,
she
has
got
a
languishing
eye
,
and
reads
romances
 
<EOS>
Then
there
's
her
brother
,
"
squire
Jery
,
a
pert
jackanapes
,
full
of
college
-
petulance
and
self
-
conceit
;
proud
as
a
German
count
,
and
as
hot
and
hasty
as
a
Welch
mountaineer
.
<EOS>
As
for
that
fantastical
animal
,
my
sister
Tabby
,
you
are
no
stranger
to
her
qualifications
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
<EOS>
,
she
is
sometimes
so
intolerable
,
that
I
almost
think
she
's
the
devil
incarnate
come
to
torment
me
for
my
sins
;
and
yet
I
am
conscious
of
no
sins
that
ought
to
entail
such
family
-
plagues
upon
me
 
why
the
devil
should
not
I
shake
of
these
torments
at
once
?
<EOS>
I
an't
married
to
Tabby
,
thank
Heaven
!
<EOS>
nor
did
I
beget
the
other
two
:
<EOS>
let
them
chose
another
guardian
:
for
my
part
,
I
an't
in
a
condition
to
take
care
of
myself
;
much
less
to
superintend
the
conduct
of
giddy
-
headed
boys
and
girls
.
<EOS>
You
earnestly
desire
to
know
the
particulars
of
our
adventure
at
Gloucester
,
which
are
briefly
these
,
and
I
hope
they
will
go
no
further
:
  
Liddy
had
been
so
long
cooped
up
in
a
boarding
-
school
,
which
,
next
to
a
nunnery
,
is
the
worst
kind
of
seminary
that
ever
was
contrived
for
young
women
,
that
she
became
as
inflammable
as

and

<EOS>
she
fell
in
love
with
one
of
the
actors
 
a
handsome
young
fellow
that
goes
by
the
name
of
Wilson
.
<EOS>
The
rascal
soon
perceived
the
impression
he
had
made
,
and
managed
matters
so
as
to
see
her
at
a
house
where
she
went
to
drink
tea
with
her
governess
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
beginning
of
a
correspondence
,
which
they
kept
up
by
means
of
a
jade
of
a
milliner
who
made
and
dressed
caps
for
the
girls
at
the
boarding
-
school
.
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
Gloucester
,
Liddy
came
to
stay
at
lodgings
with
her
aunt
,
and
Wilson
bribed
the
maid
to
deliver
a
letter
into
her
own
hands
;
but
it
seems
Jery
had
already
acquired
so
much
credit
with
the
maid
,
(
by
what
means
he
best
knows
)
that
she
carried
the
letter
to
him
,
and
so
the
whole
plot
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
The
rash
boy
,
without
saying
a
word
of
the
matter
to
me
,
went
immediately
in
search
of
Wilson
;
and
I
suppose
,
treated
him
with
insolence
enough
.
<EOS>
The
theatrical
hero
was
too
far
gone
in
romance
to
brook
such
usage
:
he
replied
in
blank
verse
,
and
a
formal
challenge
ensued
.
<EOS>
They
agreed
to
meet
early
next
morning
and
decide
the
dispute
with
sword
and
pistol
.
<EOS>
I
heard
nothing
at
all
of
the
affair
,
till
Mr
Morley
came
to
my
bedside
in
the
moring
,
and
told
me
he
was
afraid
my
nephew
was
going
to
fight
,
as
he
had
been
overheard
talking
very
loud
and
vehement
with
Wilson
at
the
young
man
's
lodgings
the
night
before
,
and
afterwards
went
and
bought
powder
and
ball
at
a
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
immediately
,
and
upon
inquiry
found
he
was
just
gone
out
.
<EOS>
I
begged
Morley
to
knock
up
the
mayor
,
that
he
might
interpose
as
a
magistrate
,
and
in
the
mean
time
I
hobbled
after
the
squire
,
whom
I
saw
at
a
distance
walking
at
a
great
pace
towards
the
city
gate
  
in
spite
of
all
my
efforts
,
I
could
not
come
up
till
our
two
combatants
had
taken
their
ground
,
and
were
priming
their
pistols
.
<EOS>
An
old
house
luckily
screened
me
from
their
view
;
so
that
I
rushed
upon
them
at
once
,
before
I
was
perceived
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
confounded
,
and
attempted
to
make
their
escape
different
ways
;
but
Morley
coming
up
with
constables
at
that
instant
,
took
Wilson
into
custody
,
and
Jery
followed
him
quietly
to
the
mayor
's
house
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
I
was
ignorant
of
what
had
passed
the
preceding
day
;
and
neither
of
the
parties
would
discover
a
tittle
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
mayor
observed
that
it
was
great
presumption
in
Wilson
who
was
a
stroller
,
to
proceed
to
such
ex
tremities
with
a
gentleman
of
family
and
fortune
;
and
threatened
to
commit
him
on
the
vagrant
act
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
fellow
bustled
up
with
great
spirit
,
declaring
he
was
a
gentleman
,
and
would
be
treated
as
such
;
but
he
refused
to
explain
himself
further
.
<EOS>
The
master
of
the
company
being
sent
for
,
and
examined
,
touching
the
said
Wilson
,
<EOS>
said
the
young
man
had
engaged
with
him
at
Birmingham
about
six
months
ago
;
but
never
would
take
his
salary
;
that
he
had
behaved
so
well
in
his
private
character
,
as
to
acquire
the
respect
and
good
-
will
of
all
his
acquaintance
,
and
that
the
public
owned
his
merit
,
as
an
actor
,
was
altogether
extraordinary
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
fancy
,
he
will
turn
out
to
be
a
run
-
way
prentice
from
London
 
<EOS>
The
manager
offered
to
bail
him
for
any
sum
,
provided
he
would
give
his
word
and
honour
that
he
would
keep
the
peace
;
but
the
young
gentleman
was
on
his
high
ropes
,
and
would
by
no
means
lay
himself
under
any
restrictions
:
on
the
other
hand
,
Hopefull
,
was
equally
obstinate
;
till
at
length
the
mayor
declared
,
that
If
they
both
refused
to
be
bound
over
,
he
would
immediately
commit
Wilson
as
a
vagrant
to
hard
labour
.
<EOS>
I
own
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
Jery
's
behaviour
on
this
occasion
:
he
said
that
rather
than
Mr
Wilson
should
be
treated
in
such
an
ignominious
manner
,
he
would
give
his
word
and
honour
to
prosecute
the
affair
no
further
while
they
remained
at
Gloucester
 
<EOS>
Wilson
thanked
him
for
his
generous
manner
of
proceeding
,
and
was
discharged
.
<EOS>
On
our
return
to
our
lodgings
,
my
nephew
explained
the
whole
mystery
;
and
I
own
<EOS>
I
was
exceedingly
incensed
.
  
<EOS>
Liddy
being
questioned
on
the
subject
,
and
very
severely
reproached
by
that
wild
-
cat
my
sister
Tabby
,
first
swooned
away
,
then
dissolving
into
a
flood
of
tears
,
confessed
all
the
particulars
of
the
correspondence
,
at
the
same
time
giving
up
three
letters
,
which
was
all
she
had
received
from
her
admirer
.
<EOS>
The
last
,
which
Jery
intercepted
,
I
send
you
inclosed
,
and
when
you
have
read
it
,
I
dare
say
you
wo
n't
wonder
at
the
progress
the
writer
had
made
in
the
heart
of
a
simple
girl
,
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
characters
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
Thinking
it
was
high
time
to
remove
her
from
such
a
dangerous
connection
,
I
carried
her
off
the
very
next
day
to
Bristol
;
but
the
poor
creature
was
so
frightened
and
fluttered
,
by
our
threats
and
expostulations
,
that
she
fell
sick
the
fourth
day
after
our
arrival
at
Clifton
,
and
continued
so
ill
for
a
whole
week
that
her
life
was
despaired
of
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
yesterday
that
Dr
Rigge
declared
her
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
what
I
have
suffered
,
partly
from
the
indiscretion
of
this
poor
child
,
but
much
more
from
the
fear
of
losing
her
entirely
.
<EOS>
This
air
is
intolerably
cold
,
and
the
place
quite
solitary
 
<EOS>
I
never
go
down
to
the
well
without
returning
low
-
spirited
;
for
there
I
meet
with
half
a
dozen
poor
emaciated
creatures
,
with
ghostly
looks
,
in
the
last
stage
of
a
consumption
,
who
have
made
shift
to
linger
through
the
winter
,
like
so
many
exotic
plants
languishing
in
a
hot
-
house
;
but
,
in
all
appearance
,
will
drop
into
their
graves
before
the
sun
has
warmth
enough
to
mitigate
the
rigour
of
this
ungenial
spring
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
think
the
Bath
water
will
be
of
any
service
to
me
,
I
will
go
thither
as
soon
as
my
niece
can
bear
the
motion
of
the
coach
.
  
<EOS>
Tell
Barns
I
am
obliged
to
him
for
his
advice
;
but
do
n't
choose
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
If
Davis
voluntarily
offers
to
give
up
the
farm
,
the
other
shall
have
it
;
but
I
will
not
begin
at
this
time
of
day
to
distress
my
tenants
,
because
they
are
unfortunate
,
and
can
not
make
regular
payments
<EOS>
:
I
wonder
that
Barns
would
think
me
capable
of
such
oppression
 
<EOS>
As
for
Higgins
,
the
fellow
is
a
notorious
poacher
,
to
be
sure
;
and
an
impudent
rascal
to
set
his
snares
in
my
own
paddock
;
but
,
I
suppose
,
he
thought
he
had
some
right
(
especially
in
my
absence
)
to
partake
of
what
nature
seems
to
have
intended
for
common
use
 
you
may
threaten
him
in
my
name
,
as
much
as
you
please
,
and
if
he
repeats
the
offence
,
let
me
know
it
before
you
have
recourse
to
justice
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
a
great
sportsman
,
and
oblige
many
of
your
friends
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
tell
you
to
make
use
of
my
grounds
;
but
it
may
be
necessary
to
hint
,
that
I
'm
more
afraid
of
my
fowling
piece
than
of
my
game
.
<EOS>
When
you
can
spare
two
or
three
brace
of
partridges
,
send
them
over
by
the
stage
coach
,
and
tell
Gwyllim
that
she
fyrgot
to
pack
up
my
flannels
and
wide
shoes
in
the

-
mail
 
<EOS>
I
shall
trouble
you
as
usual
,
from
time
to
time

till
at
last
I
suppose
you
will
be
tired
of
corresponding

MISS

you
are
going

dear
Miss
Melford
!
 
<EOS>
you
are
going

I

not

<EOS>
what

<EOS>
which

I

?
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
I
say
 
<EOS>
all
night
long
have
I
been
tossed
in
a
sea
of
doubts
and
fears
,
uncertainty
and
distraction
,
without
being
able
to
connect
my
thoughts
,
much
less
to
form
any
consistent
plan
of
conduct
 
<EOS>
I
was
even
tempted
to
wish
that
I
had
never
seen
you
;
or
that
you
had
been
less
amiable
,
or
less
compassionate
to
your
poor
Wislon
;
and
yet
it
would
be
detestable
ingratitude
in
me
to
form
such
a
wish
,
considering
how
much
I
am
indebted
to
your
goodness
,
and
the
ineffable
pleasure
I
have
derived
from
your
indulgence
and
approbation
 
Good
God
!
<EOS>
I
never
heard
your
name
mentioned
without
emotion
!
<EOS>
the
most
distant
prospect
of
being
admitted
to
your
company
,
filled
my
whole
soul
with
a
kind
of
pleasing
alarm
!
<EOS>
as
the
time
approached
,
my
heart
beat
with
redoubled
force
,
and
every
nerve
thrilled
with
a
transport
of
expectation
;
but
,
when
I
found
myself
actually
in
your
presence
;
 
when
I
heard
you
speak
;
 
when
I
saw
you
smile
;
when
I
beheld
your
charming
eyes
turned
favourably
upon
me
;
my
breast
was
filled
with
such
tumults
of
delight
,
as
wholly
deprived
me
of
the
power
of
utterance
,
and
wrapt
me
in
a
delirium
of
joy
!
 
<EOS>
encouraged
by
your
sweetness
of
temper
and
affability
,
I
ventured
to
describe
the
feelings
of
my
heart
 
<EOS>
even
then
you
did
not
check
my
presumption
  
<EOS>
you
pitied
my
sufferings
,
and
gave
me
leave
to
hope
 
you
put
a
favourable
 
perhaps
too
favourable
a
construction
,
on
my
appearance
 
<EOS>
certain
it
is
,
<EOS>
I
am
no
player
in
love
 
<EOS>
I
speak
the
language
of
my
own
heart
;
and
have
no
prompter
but
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
there
is
something
in
this
heart
,
which
I
have
not
yet
disclosed
 
<EOS>
I
flattered
myself
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
will
not
 
I
must
not
proceed
 
Dear
Miss
Liddy

<EOS>
for
Heaven
's
sake
,
contrive
,
if
possible
,
some
means
of
letting
me

to
you
before
you
leave
Gloucester
;
otherwise
,
I
know

But
I
begin

again
 
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to

fortitude
 
while
I
am
capable

I

yet
I
am

<EOS>
The

seems
to
deny
me
light
 
<EOS>
a
cloud
hangs
over
me
,
and
there
is
a
dreadful
weight
upon
my
spirits

<EOS>
While
you
stay
in
this

I
shall
continually
hover
about
your

as
the

DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
I
GIVE
Mansel
credit
for
his
invention
,
in
propagating
the
report
that
I
had
a
quarrel
with
a
mountebank
's
merry
Andrew
at
Gloucester
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
too
much
respect
for
every
appendage
of
wit
,
to
quarrel
even
with
the
lowest
buffoonery
;
and
therefore
I
hope
Mansel
<EOS>
and
I
shall
always
be
good
friends
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
,
however
,
approve
of
his
drowning
my
poor
dog
Ponto
,
on
purpose
to
convert
Ovid
's
pleonasm
into
a
punning
epitaph
 
deerant
quoque
Littora
Ponto
:
for
,
that
he
threw
him
into
the
Isis
,
when
it
was
so
high
and
impetuous
,
with
no
other
view
than
to
kill
the
fleas
,
is
an
excuse
that
will
not
hold
water
 
<EOS>
But
I
leave
poor
Ponto
to
his
fate
,
and
hope
Providence
will
take
care
to
accommodate
Mansel
with
a
drier
death
.
    
<EOS>
As
there
is
nothing
that
can
be
called
company
at
the
Well
,
I
am
here
in
a
state
of
absolute
rustication
:
This
,
however
,
gives
me
leisure
to
observe
the
singularities
in
my
uncle
's
character
,
which
seems
to
have
interested
your
curiosity
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
his
disposition
and
mine
,
which
,
like
oil
and
vinegar
,
repelled
one
another
at
first
,
have
now
begun
to
mix
by
dint
of
being
beat
up
together
.
<EOS>
I
was
once
apt
to
believe
him
a
complete
Cynic
;
and
that
nothing
but
the
necessity
of
his
occasions
could
compel
him
to
get
within
the
pale
of
society
  
<EOS>
I
am
now
of
another
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
peevishness
arises
partly
from
bodily
pain
,
and
partly
from
a
natural
excess
of
mental
sensibility
;
for
,
I
suppose
the
mind
as
well
as
the
body
,
is
in
some
cases
endued
with
a
morbid
excess
of
sensation
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
t'other
day
much
diverted
with
a
conversation
that
passed
in
the
Pump
-
room
,
betwixt
him
and
the
famous
Dr
L####n
,
who
is
come
to
ply
at
the
Well
for
patients
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
complaining
of
the
stink
,
occasioned
by
the
vast
quantity
of
mud
and
slime
,
which
the
river
leaves
at
low
ebb
under
the
windows
of
the
Pump
-
room
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
the
exhalations
arising
from
such
a
nuisance
,
could
not
but
be
prejudicial
to
the
weak
lungs
of
many
consumptive
patients
,
who
came
to
drink
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
Doctor
overhearing
this
remark
,
made
up
to
him
,
and
assured
him
he
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
people
in
general
were
so
misled
by
vulgar
prejudices
,
that
philosophy
was
hardly
sufficient
to
undeceive
them
.
<EOS>
Then
humming
thrice
,
he
assumed
a
most
ridiculous
solemnity
of
aspect
,
and
entered
into
a
learned
investigation
of
the
nature
of
stink
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
stink
,
or
stench
,
meant
no
more
than
a
strong
impression
on
the
olfactory
nerves
;
and
might
be
applied
to
substances
of
the
most
opposite
qualities
;
that
in
the
Dutch
language
,
stinken
signified
the
most
agreeable
perfume
,
as
well
as
the
most
fetid
odour
,
as
appears
in
Van
Vloudel
's
translation
of
Horace
,
in
that
beautiful
ode
,
Quis
multa
gracilis
,
&
c.
  
<EOS>
The
words
liquidus
perfusus
odoribus
<EOS>
,
he
translates
van
civet
&
moschata
gestinken
:
<EOS>
that
individuals
differed
toto
coelo
in
their
opinion
of
smells
,
which
,
indeed
,
was
altogether
as
arbitrary
as
the
opinion
of
beauty
;
that
the
French
were
pleased
with
the
putrid
effluvia
of
animal
food
;
and
so
were
the
Hottentots
in
Africa
,
and
the
savages
in
Greenland
;
and
that
the
Negroes
on
the
coast
of
Senegal
would
not
touch
fish
till
it
was
rotten
;
strong
presumptions
in
favour
of
what
is
generally
called
stink
,
as
those
nations
are
in
a
state
of
nature
,
undebauched
by
luxury
,
unseduced
by
whim
and
caprice
:
that
he
had
reason
to
believe
the
stercoraceous
flavour
,
condemned
by
prejudice
as
a
stink
,
<EOS>
was
,
in
fact
,
most
agreeable
to
the
organs
of
smelling
;
for
,
that
every
person
who
pretended
to
nauseate
the
smell
of
another
's
excretions
,
snuffed
up
his
own
with
particular
complacency
;
for
the
truth
of
which
he
appealed
to
all
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
then
present
<EOS>
:
he
said
the
inhabitants
of
Madrid
and
Edinburgh
found
particular
satisfaction
in
breathing
their
own
atmosphere
,
which
was
always
impregnated
with
stercoraceous
effluvia
:
that
the
learned
Dr
B
#
#
#
#
,
in
his
treatise
on
the
Four
digestions
,
explains
in
what
manner
the
volatile
effluvia
from
the
intestines
,
stimulate
and
promote
the
operations
of
the
animal
oeconomy
<EOS>
:
he
affirmed
,
the
last
Grand
Duke
of
Tuscany
,
of
the
Medicis
family
,
who
refined
upon
sensuality
with
the
spirit
of
a
philosopher
,
was
so
delighted
with
that
odour
,
that
he
caused
the
essence
of
ordure
to
be
extracted
,
and
used
it
as
the
most
delicious
perfume
:
that
he
himself
,
(
the
doctor
)
<EOS>
when
he
happened
to
be
low
-
spirited
,
or
fatigued
with
business
,
found
immediate
relief
and
uncommon
satisfaction
from
hanging
over
the
stale
contents
of
a
close
-
stool
,
while
his
servant
stirred
it
about
under
his
nose
;
nor
was
this
effect
to
be
wondered
at
,
when
we
consider
that
this
substance
abounds
with
the
self
-
same
volatile
salts
that
are
so
greedily
smelled
to
by
the
most
delicate
invalids
,
after
they
have
been
extracted
and
sublimed
by
the
chemists
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
company
began
to
hold
their
noses
;
but
the
doctor
,
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
this
signal
,
proceeded
to
shew
,
that
many
fetid
substances
were
not
only
agreeable
but
salutary
;
such
as
assafoelida
,
and
other
medicinal
gums
,
resins
,
roots
and
vegetables
,
over
and
above
burnt
feathers
,
tanpits
,
candle
snuffs
,
&
c.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
used
many
learned
arguments
to
persuade
his
audience
out
of
their
senses
;
and
from
stench
made
a
transition
to
filth
,
which
he
affirmed
was
also
a
mistaken
idea
,
in
as
much
as
objects
so
called
,
were
no
other
than
certain
modifications
of
matter
,
consisting
of
the
same
principles
that
enter
into
the
composition
of
all
created
essences
,
whatever
they
may
be
:
that
in
the
filthiest
production
of
nature
,
a
philosopher
considered
nothing
but
the
earth
,
water
,
salt
,
and
air
of
which
it
was
compounded
:
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
had
no
more
objection
to
drinking
the
dirtiest
ditch
water
,
than
he
had
to
a
glass
of
water
from
the
Hot
Well
,
provided
he
was
assured
there
was
nothing
poisonous
in
the
concrete
.
<EOS>
Then
addressing
himself
to
my
uncle
,
"
Sir
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
you
seem
to
be
of
a
dropsical
habit
,
and
probably
will
soon
have
a
confirmed
ascites
:
if
I
should
be
present
when
you
are
tapped
,
I
will
give
you
a
convincing
proof
of
what
I
assert
,
by
drinking
without
hesitation
the
water
that
comes
out
of
your
abdomen
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
made
wry
faces
at
this
declaration
,
and
my
uncle
changing
colour
,
told
him
he
did
not
desire
any
such
proof
of
his
philosophy
:
"
But
I
should
be
glad
to
know
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
what
makes
you
think
I
am
of
a
dropsical
habit
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
beg
pardon
,
(
replied
the
Doctor
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
your
ancles
are
swelled
,
and
you
seem
to
have
the
facies
leucophlegmatica
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
your
disorder
may
be
oedematous
,
or
gouty
,
or
it
may
be
the
lues
venerea
:
if
you
have
any
reason
to
flatter
yourself
<EOS>
it
is
this
last
,
sir
,
I
will
undertake
to
cure
you
with
three
small
pills
,
even
if
the
disease
should
have
attained
its
utmost
inveteracy
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
it
is
an
arcanum
which
I
have
discovered
,
and
prepared
with
infinite
labour
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
,
I
have
lately
cured
a
woman
in
Bristol
 
a
common
prostitute
,
sir
,
who
had
got
all
the
worst
symptoms
of
the
disorder
;
such
as
nodi
,
tophi
,
and
gummata
,
verrucae
,
cristae
Galli
,
and
a
serpiginous
eruption
,
or
rather
a
pocky
itch
all
over
her
body
.
  
<EOS>
By
that
time
she
had
taken
the
second
pill
,
sir
,
by
Heaven
!
<EOS>
she
was
as
smooth
as
my
hand
,
and
the
third
made
her
as
sound
and
as
fresh
as
a
new
born
infant
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
cried
my
uncle
peevishly
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
reason
to
flatter
myself
that
my
disorder
comes
within
the
efficacy
of
your
nostrum
.
<EOS>
But
,
this
patient
you
talk
of
,
may
not
be
so
sound
at
bottom
as
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
possibly
be
mistaken
:
(
rejoined
the
physician
)
for
I
have
had
communication
with
her
three
times
 
<EOS>
I
always
ascertain
my
cures
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
remark
,
all
the
ladies
retired
to
another
corner
of
the
room
,
and
some
of
them
began
to
spit
 
<EOS>
As
to
my
uncle
,
though
he
was
ruffled
at
first
by
the
doctor
's
saying
he
was
dropsical
,
he
could
not
help
smiling
at
this
ridiculous
confession
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
with
a
view
to
punish
this
original
,
told
him
there
was
a
wart
upon
his
nose
<EOS>
,
that
looked
a
little
suspicious
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
a
judge
of
those
matters
;
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
but
I
understand
that
warts
are
often
produced
by
the
distemper
;
and
that
one
upon
your
nose
seems
to
have
taken
possession
of
the
very
keystone
of
the
bridge
,
which
I
hope
is
in
no
danger
of
falling
.
"
<EOS>
L####n
seemed
a
little
confounded
at
this
remark
,
and
assured
him
it
was
nothing
but
a
common
excrescence
of
the
cuticula
,
but
that
the
bones
were
all
sound
below
;
for
the
truth
of
this
assertion
he
appealed
to
the
touch
,
desiring
he
would
feel
the
part
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
said
it
was
a
matter
of
such
delicacy
to
meddle
with
a
gentleman
's
nose
,
that
he
declined
the
office
 
upon
which
,
the
Doctor
turning
to
me
,
intreated
me
to
do
him
that
favour
.
<EOS>
complied
with
his
request
,
and
handled
it
so
roughly
,
and
he
sneezed
,
and
the
tears
ran
down
hi
-
cheeks
,
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
company
,
and
particularly
of
my
uncle
,
who
burst
out
a
-
laughing
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
been
with
him
;
and
took
notice
,
that
the
part
seemed
to
be
very
tender
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
cried
the
Doctor
)
<EOS>
it
is
naturally
a
tender
part
;
but
to
remove
all
possibility
of
doubt
,
I
will
take
off
the
wart
this
very
night
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
bowed
with
great
solemnity
all
round
,
and
retired
to
his
own
lodgings
,
where
he
applied
a
caustic
to
the
wart
;
but
it
spread
in
such
a
manner
as
to
produce
a
considerable
inflammation
,
attended
with
an
enormous
swelling
;
so
that
when
he
next
appeared
,
his
whole
face
was
overshadowed
by
this
tremendous
nozzle
;
and
the
rueful
eagerness
with
which
he
explained
this
unlucky
accident
,
was
ludicrous
beyond
all
description
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
meeting
the
original
of
a
character
,
which
you
and
I
have
often
laughed
at
in
description
;
and
what
surprizes
me
very
much
,
I
find
the
features
in
the
picture
,
which
has
been
drawn
for
him
,
rather
softened
than
over
-
charged
.
     
<EOS>
As
I
have
something
else
to
say
;
and
this
letter
has
run
to
an
unconscionable
length
,
I
shall
now
give
you
a
little
respite
,
and
trouble
you
again
by
the
very
first
post
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
take
it
in
your
head
to
retaliate
these
double
strokes
upon
    
Your
's
always

Hot

April
20
.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
KNIGHT
,
I
NOW
sit
down
to
execute
the
threat
in
the
tail
of
my
last
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
am
big
with
the
secret
,
and
long
to
be
delivered
.
<EOS>
It
relates
to
my
guardian
,
who
,
you
know
,
is
at
present
our
principal
object
in
view
.
    
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
I
thought
I
had
detected
him
in
such
a
state
of
frailty
,
as
would
but
ill
become
his
years
and
character
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
decent
sort
of
a
woman
,
not
disagreeable
in
her
person
,
that
comes
to
the
Well
,
with
a
poor
emaciated
child
,
far
gone
in
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
I
had
caught
my
uncle
's
eyes
several
times
directed
to
this
person
,
with
a
very
suspicious
expression
in
them
,
and
every
time
he
saw
himself
observed
,
he
hastily
withdrew
them
,
with
evident
marks
of
confusion
 
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
watch
him
more
narrowly
,
and
saw
him
speaking
to
her
privately
in
a
corner
of
the
walk
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
going
down
to
the
Well
one
day
,
I
met
her
half
way
up
the
hill
to
Clifton
,
and
could
not
help
suspecting
she
was
going
to
our
lodgings
by
appointment
,
as
it
was
about
one
o'clock
,
the
hour
when
my
sister
and
I
are
generally
at
the
Pump
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
This
notion
exciting
my
curiosity
,
I
returned
by
a
back
way
,
and
got
unperceived
into
my
own
chamber
,
which
is
contiguous
to
my
uncle
's
apartment
.
<EOS>
Sure
enough
,
the
woman
was
introduced
,
but
not
into
his
bed
-
chamber
;
he
gave
her
audience
,
in
a
parlour
;
so
that
I
was
obliged
to
shift
my
station
to
another
room
,
where
,
however
,
there
was
a
small
chink
in
the
partition
,
through
which
I
could
perceive
what
passed
 
My
uncle
though
a
little
lame
,
rose
up
when
she
came
in
,
and
setting
a
chair
for
her
,
desired
she
would
sit
down
:
then
he
asked
if
she
would
take
a
dish
of
chocolate
,
which
she
declined
,
with
much
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
he
said
,
in
a
croaking
tone
of
voice
which
confounded
me
not
a
little
,
"
Madam
,
I
am
truly
concerned
for
your
misfortunes
;
and
if
this
trifle
can
be
of
any
service
to
you
,
I
beg
you
will
accept
it
without
ceremony
,
"
So
saying
,
he
put
a
bit
of
paper
into
her
hand
,
which
she
opening
with
great
trepidation
,
exclaimed
in
an
ecstasy
,
"
Twenty
pounds
!
<EOS>
O
,
sir
!
"
and
sinking
down
upon
a
settee
,
fainted
away
 
Frightned
at
this
fit
,
and
,
I
suppose
,
afraid
of
calling
for
assistance
,
lest
her
situation
should
give
rise
to
unfavourable
conjectures
,
he
ran
about
the
room
in
distraction
,
making
frightful
grimaces
;
and
,
at
length
,
had
recollection
enough
to
throw
a
little
water
in
her
face
;
by
which
application
she
was
brought
to
herself
:
<EOS>
but
,
then
her
feeling
took
another
turn
.
<EOS>
She
shed
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
cried
aloud
,
"
I
know
not
who
you
are
:
<EOS>
but
,
sure
 
worthy
sir
!
 
<EOS>
generous
sir
!
 
<EOS>
the
distress
of
me
and
my
poor
dying
child
 
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
the
widow
's
prayers
 
if
the
orphan
's
tears
of
gratitude
can
ought
avail
 
gracious
Providence
!
  
<EOS>
Blessings
!
<EOS>
shower
down
eternal
blessings
 
<EOS>
"
Here
she
was
interrupted
by
my
uncle
,
who
muttered
in
a
voice
still
more
and
more
discordant
,
"
For
Heaven
's
sake
be
quiet
,
madam
 
<EOS>
consider
 
the
people
of
the
house
 
"
sdeath
!
<EOS>
ca
n't
you
 
<EOS>
"
All
this
time
she
was
struggling
to
throw
herself
on
her
knees
,
while
he
,
seizing
her
by
the
wrists
,
endeavoured
to
seat
her
upon
the
settee
saying
,
"
Pr'ythee
 
<EOS>
good
<EOS>
now
 
hold
your
tongue
 
<EOS>
"
At
that
instant
,
who
should
burst
into
the
room
but
our
aunt
Tabby
!
<EOS>
of
all
antiquated
maidens
the
most
diabolically
capricious
  
<EOS>
Ever
prying
into
other
people
's
affairs
,
she
had
seen
the
woman
enter
,
and
followed
her
to
the
door
,
where
she
stood
listening
,
but
probably
could
hear
nothing
distinctly
,
except
my
uncle
's
last
exclamation
;
at
which
she
bounced
into
the
parlour
in
a
violent
rage
,
that
dyed
the
tip
of
her
nose
of
a
purple
hue
,
 
<EOS>
"
Fy
upon
you
,
Matt
!
<EOS>
(
cried
she
)
<EOS>
what
doings
are
these
,
to
disgrace
your
own
character
,
and
disparage
your
family
?
 
<EOS>
"
Then
snatched
the
bank
-
note
out
of
the
stranger
's
hand
,
she
went
on
 
"
<EOS>
How
now
,
twenty
pounds
!
 
<EOS>
here
is
temptation
with
a
witness
!
  
<EOS>
Good
woman
,
go
about
your
business
 
<EOS>
Brother
,
brother
,
I
know
not
which
most
to
admire
;
your
concupissins
,
or
your
extravagance
!
 
<EOS>
"
"
Good
God
,
(
exclaimed
the
poor
woman
)
shall
a
worthy
gentleman
's
character
suffer
for
an
action
,
that
does
honour
to
humanity
?
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
,
uncle
's
indignation
was
effectually
rouzed
.
<EOS>
His
face
grew
pale
,
his
teeth
chattered
,
and
his
eyes
flashed
 
"
Sister
,
(
<EOS>
cried
he
,
in
a
voice
like
thunder
)
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
,
<EOS>
your
impertinence
is
exceedingly
provoking
.
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
,
opening
the
door
of
communication
,
thrust
her
into
the
chamber
where
I
stood
,
so
affected
by
the
scene
,
that
the
tears
ran
down
my
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Observing
these
marks
of
emotion
,
"
I
do
n't
wonder
(
said
she
)
to
see
you
concerned
at
the
back
-
slidings
of
so
near
a
relation
;
a
man
of
his
years
and
infirmities
:
These
are
fine
doings
,
truly
 
This
is
a
rare
example
,
set
by
a
guardian
for
the
benefit
of
his
pupils
 
Monstrous
!
<EOS>
incongrous
!
<EOS>
sophistical
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
<EOS>
but
an
act
of
justice
to
set
her
to
rights
;
and
therefore
explained
the
mystery
 
<EOS>
But
she
would
not
be
undeceived
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
would
you
go
for
to
offer
,
for
to
arguesy
me
out
of
my
senses
?
<EOS>
Did'n't
<EOS>
I
hear
him
whispering
to
her
to
hold
her
tongue
?
<EOS>
Did'n't
<EOS>
I
see
her
in
tears
?
<EOS>
Did'n't
<EOS>
I
see
him
struggling
to
throw
her
upon
the
couch
?
<EOS>
O
filthy
!
<EOS>
hideous
!
<EOS>
abominable
!
<EOS>
Child
,
child
,
talk
not
to
me
of
charity
.
  
<EOS>
Who
gives
twenty
pounds
in
charity
?
  
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
stripling
 
You
know
nothing
of
the
world
 
<EOS>
Besides
charity
begins
at
home
 
Twenty
pounds
would
buy
me
a
complete
suit
of
flowered
silk
,
trimmings
and
all
 
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
I
quitted
the
room
,
my
contempt
for
her
,
and
my
respect
for
her
brother
,
being
increased
in
the
same
proportion
.
<EOS>
I
have
since
been
informed
,
that
the
person
,
whom
my
uncle
so
generously
relieved
,
is
the
widow
of
an
ensign
,
who
has
nothing
to
depend
upon
but
the
pension
of
fifteen
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
Well
-
house
give
her
an
excellent
character
.
<EOS>
She
lodges
in
a
garret
,
and
works
very
hard
at
plain
-
work
,
to
support
her
daughter
,
who
is
dying
of
a
consumption
.
<EOS>
I
must
own
,
to
my
shame
,
I
feel
a
strong
inclination
to
follow
my
uncle
's
example
,
in
relieving
this
poor
widow
;
but
,
betwixt
friends
,
I
am
afraid
of
being
detected
in
a
weakness
that
might
entail
the
ridicule
of
the
company
upon
,
    
Dear
Phillips
,
Your

J
Melford

<EOS>
Direct
your

to
all
our

To
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
Hot
Well
,
April
20
.
    
<EOS>
I
UNDERSTAND
your
hint
.
<EOS>
There
are
mysteries
in
physick
,
as
well
as
in
religion
;
which
we
of
the
prophane
have
no
right
to
investigate
 
<EOS>
A
man
must
not
presume
to
use
his
reason
,
unless
he
has
studied
the
categories
,
and
can
chop
logic
by
mode
and
figure
 
Between
friends
,
I
think
,
every
man
of
tolerable
parts
ought
,
at
my
time
of
day
,
to
be
both
physician
and
lawyer
,
as
far
as
his
own
constitution
and
property
are
concerned
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
have
had
an
hospital
these
fourteen
years
within
myself
,
and
studied
my
own
case
with
the
most
painful
attention
;
consequently
may
be
supposed
to
know
something
of
the
matter
,
altho
'
I
have
not
taken
regular
courses
of
phisiology
,
et
cetera
,
et
cetera
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
have
for
some
time
been
of
opinion
,
(
no
offence
,
dear
doctor
)
that
the
sum
of
all
your
medical
discoveries
amounts
to
this
,
that
the
more
you
study
the
less
you
know
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
read
all
that
has
been
written
on
the
Hot
Wells
,
and
what
I
can
collect
from
the
whole
,
is
that
the
water
contains
nothing
but
a
little
salt
,
and
calcarious
earth
,
mixed
in
such
inconsiderable
proportion
,
as
can
have
very
little
,
if
any
,
effect
on
the
animal
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
This
being
the
case
,
I
think
,
the
man
deserves
to
be
fitted
with
a
cap
and
bells
,
who
,
for
such
a
paltry
advantage
as
this
spring
affords
,
sacrifices
his
precious
time
,
which
might
be
employed
in
taking
more
effectual
remedies
,
and
exposes
himself
to
the
dirt
,
the
stench
,
the
chilling
blasts
,
and
perpetual
rains
,
that
render
this
place
to
me
intolerable
.
<EOS>
If
these
waters
,
from
a
small
degree
of
astringency
,
are
of
some
service
in
the
diabetes
,
diarrhea
,
and
night
sweats
,
when
the
secretions
are
to
much
encreased
,
must
not
they
do
harm
in
the
same
pro
portion
,
where
the
humours
are
obstructed
,
as
in
the
asthma
,
scurvy
gout
,
and
dropsy
?
  
<EOS>
Now
we
talk
of
the
dropsy
,
here
is
a
strange
,
fantastical
oddity
,
one
of
your
brethren
,
who
harangues
every
day
in
the
pump
-
room
,
as
if
he
was
hired
to
give
lectures
on
all
subjects
whatsoever
 
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
make
of
him
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
makes
shrewd
remarks
;
at
other
times
,
he
talks
like
the
greatest
simpleton
in
nature
 
<EOS>
He
has
read
a
great
deal
;
but
without
method
or
judgment
,
and
digested
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
believes
every
thing
he
has
read
;
especially
if
it
has
any
thing
of
the
marvellous
in
it
;
and
his
conversation
is
a
surprising
hotch
potch
of
erudition
and
extravagance
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
t'other
day
,
with
great
confidence
,
that
my
case
was
dropsical
;
or
,
as
he
called
it
,
leucophlegmatic
:
A
sure
sign
,
that
his
want
of
experience
is
equal
to
his
presumption
;
for
,
you
know
,
there
is
nothing
analogous
to
the
dropsy
in
my
disorder
 
<EOS>
I
wish
those
impertinent
fellows
,
with
their
ricketty
understandings
,
would
keep
their
advice
for
those
that
ask
it
 
Dropsy
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Sure
I
have
not
lived
to
the
age
of
fifty
-
five
,
and
had
such
experience
of
my
own
disorder
,
and
consulted
you
and
other
eminent
physicians
,
so
often
,
and
so
long
,
to
be
undeceived
by
such
a
  
<EOS>
But
,
without
all
doubt
,
the
man
is
mad
;
and
,
therefore
,
what
he
says
is
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
yesterday
,
a
visit
from
Higgins
;
who
came
hither
under
the
terror
of
your
threats
,
and
brought
me
as
a
present
a
brace
of
hares
;
which
he
owned
he
took
in
my
own
ground
;
and
I
could
not
persuade
the
fellow
that
he
did
wrong
,
or
that
I
would
ever
prosecute
him
for
poaching
 
<EOS>
I
must
desire
you
will
wink
hard
at
the
practises
of
this
rascallion
;
otherwise
I
shall
be
plagued
with
his
presents
;
which
cost
me
more
than
they
are
worth
  
<EOS>
If
I
could
wonder
at
any
thing
Fitzowen
does
,
I
should
be
surprised
at
his
assurance
,
in
desiring
you
to
solicit
my
vote
for
him
,
at
the
next
election
for
the
county
:
for
him
,
who
opposed
me
on
the
like
occasion
,
with
the
most
illiberal
competition
  
<EOS>
You
may
tell
him
civilly
,
that
I
beg
to
be
excused
.
<EOS>
Direct
your
next
for
me
at
Bath
,
whither
I
propose
to
remove
to

morrow
;
not
only
on
my
own
account
,
but
for
the
sake
of
my
niece
,
Liddy
,
who
is
like
to
relapse
.
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
fell
into
a
fit
yesterday
,
while
I
was
cheapening
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
with
a
Jew

pedler
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
there
is
something
still
lurking
in
that
little
heart
of
her

;
which
I
hope
a
change
of
objects
will
remove
.
<EOS>
Let
me
know
what
you
think
of
this
half
-
witted
Doctor
's
impertinent
,
ridiculous
,
and
absurd
notion
of
my
disorder
 
So
far
from
being
dropsical
,
I
am
as
lank
in
the
belly
as
a
grey

hound
;
and
,
by
measuring
my
ancle
with
a

,
I
find
the
swelling
subsides
every
day
 
From
such
doctors
,
good
Lord
deliver
us

I
have
not
yet
taken
any

Bath

because
there
we
can
be
accommodated
at
a

warning

and
I
shall
choose

I

not

your

MY
DEAR
LETTY
,
I
DID
not
intend
to
trouble
you
again
,
till
we
should
be
settled
at
Bath
;
but
having
the
occasion
of
Jarvis
,
I
could
not
let
it
slip
,
especially
as
I
have
something
extraordinary
to
communicate
 
O
,
my
dear
companion
!
<EOS>
what
shall
I
tell
you
?
<EOS>
for
several
days
past
there
was
a
Jew
-
looking
man
,
that
plied
at
the
Wells
with
a
box
of
spectacles
;
and
he
always
eyed
me
so
earnestly
,
that
I
began
to
be
very
uneasy
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
came
to
our
lodgings
at
Clifton
,
and
lingered
about
the
door
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
to
somebody
 
<EOS>
I
was
seized
with
an
odd
kind
of
fluttering
,
and
begged
Win
to
throw
herself
in
his
way
:
but
the
poor
girl
has
weak
nerves
,
and
was
afraid
of
his
beard
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
having
occasion
for
new
glasses
,
called
him
up
stairs
,
and
was
trying
a
pair
of
spectacles
,
when
the
man
,
advancing
to
me
said
,
in
a
whisper
 
O
gracious
!
<EOS>
what
d'ye
think
he
said
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
Wilson
!
"
<EOS>
His
features
struck
me
that
very
moment
 
<EOS>
it
was
Wilson
,
sure
enough
!
<EOS>
but
so
disguised
,
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
know
him
,
if
my
heart
had
not
assisted
in
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
surprised
,
and
so
frightened
,
that
I
fainted
away
;
but
soon
recovered
;
and
found
myself
supported
by
him
on
the
chair
,
while
my
uncle
was
running
about
the
room
,
with
the
spectacles
on
his
nose
calling
for
help
.
<EOS>
I
had
no
opportunity
to
speak
to
him
;
but
our
looks
were
sufficiently
expressive
.
<EOS>
He
was
payed
for
his
glasses
,
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
Then
I
told
Win
who
he
was
,
and
sent
her
after
him
to
the
Pump
-
room
;
where
she
spoke
to
him
,
and
begged
him
in
my
name
to
withdraw
from
the
place
,
that
he
might
not
incur
the
suspicion
of
my
uncle
or
my
brother
,
if
he
did
not
want
to
see
me
die
of
terror
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
The
poor
youth
declared
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
he
had
something
extraordinary
to
communicate
;
and
asked
,
if
she
would
deliver
a
letter
to
me
:
but
this
she
absolutely
refused
,
by
my
order
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
her
obstinate
in
her
refusal
,
he
desired
she
would
tell
me
,
that
he
was
no
longer
a
player
,
but
a
gentleman
;
in
which
character
he
would
very
soon
avow
his
passion
for
me
,
without
fear
of
censure
or
reproach
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
even
discovered
his
name
and
family
;
which
,
to
my
great
grief
,
the
simple
girl
forgot
,
in
the
confusion
occasioned
by
her
being
seen
talking
to
him
by
my
brother
;
who
stopt
her
on
the
road
,
and
asked
what
business
she
had
with
that
rascally
Jew
  
<EOS>
She
pretended
she
was
cheapening
a
stay
-
hook
;
but
was
thrown
into
such
a
quandary
,
that
she
forgot
the
most
material
part
of
the
information
;
and
when
she
came
home
,
went
into
an
hysteric
fit
of
laughing
.
<EOS>
This
transaction
happened
three
days
ago
,
during
which
he
has
not
appeared
;
so
that
I
suppose
he
is
gone
.
<EOS>
Dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
you
see
how
Fortune
takes
pleasure
in
persecuting
your
poor
friend
.
<EOS>
If
you
should
see
him
at
Gloucester
 
<EOS>
or
if
you
have
seen
him
,
and
know
his
real
name
and
family
,
pray
keep
me
no
longer
in
suspence
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
if
he
is
under
no
obligation
to
keep
himself
longer
concealed
,
and
has
a
real
affection
for
me
,
I
should
hope
he
will
,
in
a
little
time
,
declare
himself
to
my
relations
.
<EOS>
Sure
,
if
there
is
nothing
unsuitable
in
the
match
,
they
wo
n't
be
so
cruel
as
to
thwart
my
inclinations
 
<EOS>
O
,
what
happiness
would
then
be
my
portion
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
indulging
the
thought
,
and
pleasing
my
fancy
with
such
agreeable
ideas
;
which
,
after
all
,
perhaps
,
will
never
be
realised
 
<EOS>
But
,
why
should
I
despair
?
<EOS>
who
knows
what
will
happen
?
  
<EOS>
We
set
out
for
Bath
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
am
almost
sorry
for
it
;
as
I
begin
to
be
in
love
with
solitude
,
and
this
is
a
charming
romantic
place
.
<EOS>
The
air
is
so
pure
;
the
Downs
are
so
agreeable
;
the
furze
in
full
blossom
;
the
ground
enamelled
with
daisies
,
and
primroses
,
and
cowslips
;
all
the
trees
bursting
into
leaves
,
and
the
hedges
already
cloathed
with
their
vernal
livery
;
the
mountains
covered
with
flocks
of
sheep
,
and
tender
bleating
wanton
lambkins
playing
,
frisking
and
skipping
from
side
to
side
;
the
groves
resound
with
the
notes
of
black
-
bird
,
thrush
,
and
linnet
;
and
all
night
long
sweet
<EOS>
Philomel
pours
forth
her
ravishingly
-
delightful
song
.
<EOS>
Then
,
for
variety
,
we
go
down
to
the
nymph
of
Bristol
spring
,
where
the
company
is
assembled

dinner

so
good

natured

so
free

so
easy

and
<EOS>
there
we
drink
the
water
so
clear
,
so
pure
,
so
mild

<EOS>
so
charmingly
maukish

<EOS>
There
the
sun
is
so
chearful
and
reviving
;
the
weather
so
soft
;
the
walk
so
agreeable
;
the
prospect
so
amusing

and
the
ships
and
boats
going
up
and
down
the
river
,
close
under
the
windows
of
the
Pump

room
,
afford
such
an
enchanting
variety
of
moveing
pictures
,
as
require
a
much
abler
pen
than
mine
to
describe

<EOS>
To
make
this
place
a
perfect
paradise
to
me
,
nothing
is
wanting
but
an
agreeable
companion
and
sincere
friend
;
such
as
my
dear
miss
Willis
hath
been
,
and
I
hope
still
will
be
,
to
her
ever
faithful
    
Lydia
Melford

<EOS>
Direct

me

still

Jarvis

take

Adieu

<EOS>
To
Sir

Phillips
,
of
Jesus
college

<EOS>
Bath
,
April

<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
<EOS>
,
YOU
have
,
indeed
,
reason
to
be
surprised
,
that
I
should
have
concealed
my
correspondence
with
miss
Blakerby
from
you
,
to
whom
I
disclosed
all
my
other
connections
of
that
nature
;
but
the
truth
is
,
I
never
dreamed
of
any
such
commerce
,
till
your
last
informed
me
,
that
it
had
produced
something
which
could
not
be
much
longer
concealed
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
lucky
circumstance
,
however
,
that
her
reputation
will
not
suffer
any
detriment
,
but
rather
derive
advantage
from
the
discovery
;
which
will
prove
,
at
least
,
that
it
is
not
quite
so
rotten
,
as
most
people
imagined
 
For
my
own
part
,
I
declare
to
you
,
in
all
the
sincerity
of
friendship
,
that
far
from
having
any
amorous
intercourse
with
the
object
in
question
I
never
had
the
least
acquaintance
with
her
person
;
but
,
if
she
is
really
in
the
condition
you
describe
,
I
suspect
Mansel
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
His
visits
to
that
shrine
were
no
secret
;
and
this
attachment
,
added
to
some
good
offices
,
which
you
know
he
has
done
me
,
since
I
left
Alma
-
mater
,
give
me
a
right
to
belive
him
capable
of
saddling
me
with
this
scandal
,
when
my
back
was
turned
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
if
my
name
can
be
of
any
service
to
him
,
he
is
welcome
to
make
use
of
it
;
and
if
the
woman
should
be
abandoned
enough
to
swear
his
bantling
to
me
,
I
must
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
compound
with
the
parish
:
I
shall
pay
the
penalty
without
repining
;
and
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
draw
upon
me
immediately
for
the
sum
required
  
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
I
act
by
the
advice
of
my
uncle
;
who
says
,
I
shall
have
good
-
luck
if
I
pass
through
life
without
being
obliged
to
make
many
more
compositions
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
told
me
last
night
,
with
great
good
humour
that
betwixt
the
age
of
twenty
and
forty
,
he
had
been
obliged
to
provide
for
nine
bastards
,
sworn
to
him
by
women
whom
he
never
saw
 
Mr
Bramble
's
character
,
which
seems
to
interest
you
greatly
,
opens
and
improves
upon
me
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
His
singularities
afford
a
rich
mine
of
entertainment
:
his
understanding
,
so
far
as
I
can
judge
,
is
well
cultivated
:
his
observations
on
life
are
equally
just
,
pertinent
,
and
uncommon
.
<EOS>
He
affects
misanthrophy
,
in
order
to
conceal
the
sensibility
of
a
heart
,
which
is
tender
,
even
to
a
degree
of
weakness
,
This
delicacy
of
feeling
,
or
soreness
of
the
mind
makes
him
timorous
and
fearful
;
but
then
he
is
afraid
of
nothing
so
much
as
of
dishonour
;
and
although
he
is
exceedingly
cautious
of
giving
offence
,
he
will
fire
at
the
least
hint
of
insolence
or
ill
-
breeding
 
Respectable
as
he
is
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
ca
n't
help
being
sometimes
diverted
by
his
little
distresses
;
which
provoke
him
to
let
fly
the
shafts
of
his
satire
,
keen
and
penetrating
as
the
arrows
of
Teucer
 
<EOS>
Our
aunt
,
Tabitha
,
acts
upon
him
as
<EOS>
a
perpetual
grind
-
stone
 
She
is
,
in
all
respects
,
a
striking
contrast
to
her
brother
 
<EOS>
But
I
reserve
her
portrait
for
another
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
Three
days
ago
we
came
hither
from
the
Hot
Well
,
and
took
possession
of
the
first
floor
of
a
lodging
-
house
,
on
the
South
Parade
;
a
situation
which
my
uncle
chose
,
for
its
being
near
the
Bath
,
and
remote
from
the
noise
of
carriages
.
<EOS>
He
was
scarce
warm
in
the
lodgings
when
he
called
for
his
night
cap
,
his
wide
shoes
and
flannel
;
and
declared
himself
invested
with
the
gout
in
his
right
foot
;
though
,
I
believe
,
it
had
as
yet
reached
no
farther
than
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
he
had
reason
to
repent
his
premature
declaration
;
for
our
aunt
Tabitha
found
means
to
make
such
a
clamour
and
confusion
,
before
the
flannels
could
be
produced
from
the
trunk
,
that
one
would
have
imagined
the
house
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
uncle
sat
boiling
with
impatience
,
biting
his
fingers
,
throwing
up
his
eyes
,
and
muttering
ejaculations
;
at
length
he
burst
into
a
kind
of
convulsive
laugh
,
after
which
he
hummed
a
song
;
and
when
the
hurricane
was
over
,
exclaimed
,
"
Blessed
be
God
for
all
things
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
but
the
begining
of
his
troubles
.
<EOS>
Mrs
,
Tabitha
's
favourite
dog
Chowder
,
having
paid
his
compliments
to
a
female
turn
-
spit
,
of
his
own
species
,
in
the
kitchen
,
involved
himself
in
a
quarrel
with
no
fewer
than
five
rivals
,
who
set
upon
him
at
once
,
and
drove
him
up
stairs
to
the
dining
-
room
door
,
with
hideous
noise
:
there
our
aunt
and
her
woman
,
taking
arms
in
his
defence
,
joined
the
concert
;
which
became
truly
diabolical
.
<EOS>
This
fray
being
with
difficulty
suppressed
,
by
the
intervention
of
our
own
foot
-
man
and
the
cook
-
maid
of
the
house
,
the
"
squire
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
expostulate
with
Tabby
,
when
the
town
-
waits
,
in
the
passage
below
,
struck
up
their
musick
,
(
if
musick
it
may
be
called
)
with
such
a
sudden
burst
of
sound
,
as
made
him
start
and
stare
,
with
marks
of
indignation
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
He
had
recollection
enough
to
send
his
servant
with
some
money
to
silence
those
noisy
intruders
;
and
they
were
immediately
dismissed
,
though
not
without
some
opposition
on
the
part
of
Tabitha
,
who
thought
it
but
reasonable
that
he
should
have
more
musick
for
his
money
.
<EOS>
Scarce
had
he
settled
this
knotty
point
,
when
a
strange
kind
of
thumping
and
bouncing
was
heard
right
over
-
head
,
in
the
second
story
,
so
loud
and
violent
as
to
shake
the
whole
building
.
<EOS>
I
own
I
was
exceedingly
provoked
at
this
new
alarm
;
and
before
my
uncle
had
time
to
express
himself
on
the
subject
I
ran
up
stairs
,
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
room
-
door
open
,
I
entered
without
ceremony
,
and
perceived
an
object
,
which
I
can
not
now
recollect
without
laughing
to
excess
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dancing
master
,
with
his
scholar
,
in
the
act
of
teaching
.
<EOS>
The
master
was
blind
of
one
eye
,
and
lame
of
one
foot
,
and
led
about
the
room
his
pupil
,
who
seemed
to
be
about
the
age
of
three
-
score
,
stooped
mortally
,
was
tall
,
raw
-
boned
,
hard
-
favoured
,
with
a
woolen
night
cap
on
his
head
;
and
he
had
stript
off
his
coat
,
that
he
might
be
more
nimble
in
his
motions
 
<EOS>
Finding
himself
intruded
upon
,
by
a
person
he
did
not
know
,
he
forthwith
girded
himself
with
a
long
iron
sword
,
and
advancing
to
me
,
with
a
peremptory
air
,
pronounced
,
in
a
true
Hibernian
accent
,
"
Mister
What
d'ye
cal
lum
,
by
my
should
and
conscience
,
I
am
very
glad
to
sea
you
,
if
you
are
after
coming
in
the
way
of
friendship
;
and
indeed
and
indeed
now
I
believe
you
are
my
friend
sure
enough
,
gra
;
though
I
never
had
the
honour
to
sea
your
face
before
,
my
dear
;
for
becaase
you
come
like
a
friend
,
without
any
ceremony
at
all
,
at
all
 
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
the
nature
of
my
visit
would
not
admit
of
ceremony
;
that
I
was
come
to
desire
he
would
make
less
noise
,
as
there
was
a
sick
gentleman
below
whom
he
had
no
right
to
disturb
with
such
preposterous
doings
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
-
ye
now
,
young
gentleman
,
(
replied
this
original
)
perhaps
,
upon
another
occasion
,
I
might
shivilly
request
you
to
explain
the
maining
of
that
hard
word
,
prepasterous
:
but
there
's
a
time
for
all
things
,
honey
 
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
passed
me
with
great
agility
,
and
,
running
down
stairs
,
found
our
footman
at
the
dining
-
room
door
,
of
whom
he
demanded
admittance
,
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
As
the
fellow
did
not
think
proper
to
refuse
the
request
of
such
a
formidable
figure
,
he
was
immediately
introduced
,
and
addressed
himself
to
my
uncle
in
these
words
:
"
Your
humble
servant
,
good
sir
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
so
prepasterous
,
as
your
son
calls
it
,
but
I
know
the
rules
of
shivility
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
Poor
knight
of
Ireland
<EOS>
,
my
name
is
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
,
of
the
county
of
Galway
;
being
your
fellow
-
lodger
,
I
'm
come
to
pay
my
respects
,
and
to
welcome
you
to
the
South
Parade
,
and
to
offer
my
best
services
to
you
,
and
your
good
lady
,
and
your
pretty
daughter
;
and
even
to
the
young
gentleman
your
son
,
though
he
thinks
me
a
prepasterous
fellow
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
am
to
have
the
honour
to
open
a
ball
next
door
to
morrow
with
lady
Mac
Manus
;
and
being
rusted
in
my
dancing
,
I
was
refreshing
my
memory
with
a
little
exercise
;
but
if
I
had
known
there
was
a
sick
person
below
,
by
Christ
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
sooner
danced
a
hompipe
upon
my
own
head
,
than
walk
the
softest
minuet
over
yours
.
"
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
was
not
a
little
startled
at
his
first
appearance
,
received
his
compliment
with
great
complacency
,
insisted
upon
his
being
seated
,
thanked
him
for
the
honour
of
his
visit
,
and
reprimanded
me
for
my
abrupt
expostulation
with
a
gentleman
of
his
rank
and
character
.
<EOS>
Thus
tutored
,
I
asked
pardon
of
the
knight
,
who
,
forthwith
starting
up
,
embraced
me
so
close
,
that
I
could
hardly
breathe
;
and
assured
me
,
he
loved
me
as
his
own
soul
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
recollecting
his
night
-
cap
,
he
pulled
it
off
in
some
confusion
;
and
,
with
his
bald
-
pate
uncovered
,
made
a
thousand
apologies
to
the
ladies
,
as
he
retired
 
At
that
instant
,
the
Abbey
bel
's
began
to
ring
so
loud
,
that
we
could
not
hear
one
another
speak
;
and
this
peal
,
as
we
afterwards
learned
,
was
for
the
honour
of
Mr
Bullock
,
an
eminent
cow
keeper
of
Tottenham
,
who
had
just
arrived
at
Bath
,
to
drink
the
waters
for
indigestion
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
had
not
time
to
make
his
remarks
upon
the
agreeable
nature
of
this
serenade
,
before
his
ears
were
saluted
with
another
concert
that
interested
him
more
nearly
.
<EOS>
Two
negroes
belonging
to
a
Creole
gentleman
,
who
lodged
in
the
same
house
,
taking
their
station
at
a
window
in
the
stair
-
case
about
ten
feet
from
our
dining
-
room
door
,
began
to
practise
upon
the
French
-
horn
;
and
being
in
the
very
first
rudiments
of
execution
,
produced
such
discordant
sounds
,
as
might
have
discomposed
the
organs
of
an
ass
 
<EOS>
You
may
guess
what
effect
they
had
upon
the
irritable
nerves
of
uncle
:
who
,
with
the
most
admirable
expression
of
splenetic
surprize
in
his
countenance
,
sent
his
man
to
silence
those
dreadful
blasts
,
and
desire
the
musicians
to
practise
in
some
other
place
,
as
they
had
no
right
to
stand
there
and
disturb
all
the
lodgers
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Those
sable
performers
,
far
from
taking
the
hint
,
and
withdrawing
treated
the
messenger
with
great
insolence
;
bidding
him
carry
his
compliments
to
their
master
,
colonel
Rigworm
,
who
would
give
him
a
proper
answer
,
and
a
good
drubbing
into
the
bargain
;
in
the
mean
time
they
continued
their
noise
,
and
even
endeavoured
to
make
it
more
disagreeable
;
laughing
between
whiles
,
at
the
thoughts
of
being
able
to
torment
their
betters
with
impunity
<EOS>
Our
"
squire
,
incensed
at
the
additional
insult
,
immediately
dispatched
the
servant
,
with
his
compliments
to
colonel
Rigworm
;
requesting
that
he
would
order
his
blacks
to
be
quiet
,
as
the
noise
they
made
was
altogether
intolerable
 
to
this
message
,
the
Creole
colonel
replied
,
that
his
horns
had
a
right
to
sound
on
a
common
stair
-
case
;
that
there
they
should
play
for
his
diversion
;
and
that
those
who
did
not
like
the
noise
,
might
look
for
lodgings
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
no
sooner
received
this
reply
than
his
eyes
began
to
glisten
,
his
face
grew
pale
,
and
his
teeth
chattered
.
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
he
slipt
on
his
shoes
,
without
speaking
a
word
,
or
seeming
to
feel
any
further
disturbance
from
the
gout
in
his
toes
.
<EOS>
Then
,
snatching
his
cane
,
he
opened
the
door
and
proceeded
to
the
place
where
the
black
trumpeters
were
posted
.
<EOS>
There
,
without
further
hesitation
,
he
began
to
belabour
them
both
;
and
exerted
himself
with
such
astonishing
vigour
and
agility
,
that
both
their
heads
and
horns
were
broken
in
a
twinkling
,
and
they
ran
howling
down
stairs
to
their
master
's
parlour
door
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
,
following
them
<EOS>
half
way
,
called
aloud
,
that
the
colonel
might
hear
him
,
"
Go
,
rascals
,
and
tell
your
master
what
I
have
done
;
if
he
thinks
himself
injured
,
he
knows
where
to
come
for
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
this
is
but
an
earnest
of
what
you
shall
receive
,
if
ever
you
presume
to
blow
a
horn
again
here
,
while
I
stay
in
the
house
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
retired
to
his
apartment
,
in
expectation
of
hearing
from
the
West
Indian
;
but
the
colonel
prudently
declined
any
farther
prosecution
of
the
dispute
.
<EOS>
My
sister
Liddy
was
frighted
into
a
fit
,
of
which
she
was
no
sooner
recovered
,
than
Mrs
Tabitha
began
a
lecture
upon
patience
;
which
her
brother
interrupted
with
a
most
significant
grin
,
exclaiming
,
"
True
,
sister
,
God
increase
my
patience
and
your
discretion
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
(
added
he
)
<EOS>
what
sort
of
sonata
we
are
to
expect
from
this
overture
,
in
which
the
devil
,
that
presides
over
horrid
sounds
,
hath
given
us
such
variations
of
discord
 
<EOS>
The
trampling
of
porters
,
the
creaking
and
crashing
of
trunks
,
the
snarling
of
curs
,
the
scolding
of
women
,
the
squeaking
and
squalling
of
fiddles
and
hautboys
out
of
tune
,
the
bouncing
of
the
Irish
baronet
over
-
head
,
and
the
bursting
,
belching
,
and
brattling
of
the
French
-
horns
in
the
passage
(
not
to
mention
the
harmonious
peal
that
still
thunders
from
the
Abby
steeple
)
succeeding
one
another
without
interruption
,
like
the
different
parts
of
the
same
concert
,
have
given
me
such
an
idea
of
what
a
poor
invalid
has
to
expect
in
this
temple
,
dedicated
to
Silence
and
Repose
,
that
I
shall
certainly
shift
my
quarters
to
-
morrow
,
and
endeavour
to
effectuate
my
retreat
before
Sir
Ulic
opens
the
ball
with
my
lady
Mac
Manus
;
a
conjunction
that
bodes
me
no
good
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
intimation
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
whose
ears
were
not
quite
so
delicate
as
those
of
her
brother
 
<EOS>
She
said
it
would
be
a
great
folly
to
move
from
such
agreeable
lodgings
,
the
moment
they
were
comfortably
settled
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
he
should
be
such
an
enemy
to
musick
and
mirth
.
<EOS>
She
heard
no
noise
but
of
his
own
making
:
it
was
impossible
to
manage
a
family
in
dumb
-
shew
.
<EOS>
He
might
harp
as
long
as
he
pleased
upon
her
scolding
;
but
she
never
scolded
,
except
for
his
advantage
;
but
he
would
never
be
satisfied
,
even
tho'f
she
should
sweat
blood
and
water
in
his
service
  
<EOS>
I
have
a
great
notion
that
our
aunt
,
who
is
now
declining
into
the
most
desperate
state
of
celibacy
had
formed
some
design
upon
the
heart
of
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
,
which
she
feared
might
be
frustrated
by
our
abrupt
departure
from
these
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
eyeing
her
askance
,
"
Pardon
me
,
sister
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
savage
,
indeed
,
were
I
insensible
of
my
own
felicity
,
in
having
such
a
mild
,
complacent
,
good
-
humoured
,
and
considerate
companion
and
house
-
keeper
;
but
as
I
have
got
a
weak
head
,
and
my
sense
of
hearing
is
painfully
acute
,
before
I
have
recourse
to
plugs
of
wool
and
cotton
,
I
'll
try
whether
I
ca
n't
find
another
lodging
,
where
I
shall
have
more
quiet
and
less
musick
.
"
<EOS>
He
accordingly
dispatched
his
man
upon
this
service
;
and
next
day
he
found
a
small
house
in
Milsham
-
street
,
which
he
hires
by
the
week
.
<EOS>
Here
,
at
least
,
we
enjoy
covenience
and
quiet
within
doors
,
as
much
as
Tabby
's
temper
will
allow
;
but
the
"
squire
still
complains
of
flying
pains
in
the
stomach
and
head
,
for
which
he
bathes
and
drinks
the
waters
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
so
bad
,
however
,
but
that
he
goes
in
person
to
the
pump
,
the
rooms
,
and
the
coffee
-
houses
;
where
he
picks
up
continual
food
for
ridicule
and
satire
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
glean
any
thing
for
your
amusement
,
either
from
his
observation
or
my
own
,
you
shall
have
it
freely
though
I
am
afraid
it
will
poorly
compensate
the
trouble
of
reading
these
tedious
insipid
letters
of
,
    
Dear
Philips
,
yours
always
,
J
Melford
.
    
<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
Bath
,
April

.
    
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
IF
I
did
not
know
that
the
exercise
of
your
profession
has
habituated
you
to
the
hearing
of
complaints
,
I
should
make
a
conscience
of
troubling
you
with
my
correspondence
,
which
may
be
truly
called
the
lamentations
of
Matthew
Bramble
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
can
not
help
thinking
,
I
have
some
right
to
discharge
the
overflowings
of
my
spleen
upon
you
,
whose
province
it
is
to
remove
those
disorders
that
occasioned
it
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
it
is
no
small
allevation
of
my
grievances
,
that
I
have
a
sensible
friend
to
whom
I
can
communicate
my
crusty
humours
,
which
,
by
retention
,
would
grow
intolerably
acrimonious
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
find
nothing
but
disappointment
at
Bath
;
which
is
so
altered
,
that
I
can
scarce
believe
it
is
the
same
place
that
I
frequented
about
thirty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
hear
you
say
,
"
Altered
it
is
,
without
all
doubt
;
but
then
it
is
altered
for
the
better
;
a
truth
which
,
perhaps
you
would
own
without
hesitation
,
if
you
yourself
was
not
altered
for
the
worse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
reflection
may
,
for
aught
I
know
,
be
just
.
<EOS>
The
inconveniences
which
I
overlooked
in
the
high
-
day
of
health
,
will
naturally
strike
with
exaggerated
impression
on
the
irritable
nerves
of
an
invalid
,
surprised
by
premature
old
age
,
and
shattered
with
long
-
suffering
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
believe
,
you
will
not
deny
,
that
this
place
,
which
Nature
and
Providence
seem
to
have
intended
as
a
resource
from
distemper
and
disquiet
,
is
become
the
very
centre
of
racket
and
dissipation
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
peace
,
tranquillity
and
ease
,
so
necessary
to
those
who
labour
under
bad
health
,
weak
nerves
,
and
irregular
spirits
;
here
we
have
nothing
but
noise
,
tumult
,
and
hurry
;
with
the
fatigue
and
slavery
of
maintaining
a
ceremonial
,
more
stiff
,
formal
,
and
oppressive
,
than
the
etiquette
of
a
German
elector
.
<EOS>
A
national
hospital
it
may
be
;
but
one
would
imagine
,
that
none
but
lunaticks
are
admitted
;
and
truly
,
I
will
give
you
leave
to
call
me
so
,
If
I
stay
much
longer
at
Bath
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
shall
take
another
opportunity
to
explain
my
sentiment
at
greater
length
on
this
subject
  
<EOS>
I
was
impatient
to
see
the
boasted
improvements
in
architecture
,
for
which
the
upper
parts
of
the
town
have
been
so
much
celebrated
,
and
,
t'other
day
I
made
a
circuit
of
all
the
new
buildings
.
<EOS>
The
Square
,
though
irregular
,
is
,
on
the
whole
pretty
well
laid
out
,
spacious
,
open
,
and
airy
;
and
,
in
my
opinion
,
by
far
the
most
wholsome
and
agreeable
situation
in
Bath
,
especially
the
upper
side
of
it
;
but
the
avenues
to
it
are
mean
,
dirty
,
dangerous
,
and
indirect
.
<EOS>
Its
communication
with
the
Baths
,
is
through
the
yard
of
an
inn
,
where
the
poor
trembling
valetudinarian
is
carried
in
a
chair
,
betwixt
the
heels
of
a
double
row
of
horses
,
wincing
under
the
curry
-
combs
of
grooms
and
postilions
,
over
and
above
the
hazard
of
being
obstructed
,
or
overturned
by
the
carriages
which
are
continually
making
their
exit
or
their
entrance
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
after
some
chairmen
shall
have
been
maimed
,
and
a
few
lives
lost
by
those
accidents
,
the
corporation
will
think
in
earnest
about
providing
a
more
safe
and
commodious
passage
.
<EOS>
The
Circus
is
a
pretty
banble
;
contrived
for
shew
,
and
looks
like
Vespasian
's
amphitheatre
turned
outside
in
.
<EOS>
If
we
consider
it
in
point
of
magnificence
,
the
great
number
of
small
doors
belonging
to
the
separate
houses
,
the
inconsiderable
height
of
the
different
orders
,
the
affected
ornaments
of
the
architrave
,
which
are
both
childish
and
misplaced
,
and
the
areas
projecting
into
the
street
,
surrounded
with
iron
rails
,
destroy
a
good
part
of
its
effect
upon
the
eye
;
and
,
perhaps
,
we
shall
find
it
still
more
defective
,
if
we
view
it
in
the
light
of
convenience
.
<EOS>
The
figure
of
each
seperate
dwelling
house
,
being
the
segment
of
a
circle
,
must
spoil
the
symmetry
of
the
rooms
,
by
contracting
them
towards
the
street
windows
,
and
leaving
a
larger
sweep
in
the
space
behind
.
<EOS>
If
instead
of
the
areas
and
iron
rails
,
which
seem
to
be
of
very
little
use
,
there
had
been
a
corridore
with
arcades
all
round
,
as
in
Covent
-
Garden
,
the
appearance
of
the
whole
would
have
been
more
magnificent
and
striking
;
those
arcades
would
have
afforded
an
agreeable
covered
walk
,
and
sheltered
the
poor
chairmen
and
their
carriages
from
the
rain
,
which
is
here
almost
perpetual
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
the
chairs
stand
soaking
in
the
open
street
,
from
morning
to
night
,
till
they
become
so
many
boxes
of
weat
leather
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
gouty
and
rheumatic
,
who
are
transported
in
them
from
place
to
place
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
is
a
shocking
inconvenience
,
that
extends
over
the
whole
city
;
and
,
I
am
persuaded
,
it
produces
infinite
mischief
to
the
delicate
and
infirm
;
even
the
close
chairs
,
contrived
for
the
sick
,
by
standing
in
the
open
air
,
have
their
frize
linings
impregnated
like
so
many
spunges
,
with
the
moisture
of
the
atmosphere
,
and
those
cases
of
cold
vapour
must
give
a
charming
check
to
the
perspiration
of
a
patient
,
piping
hot
from
the
Bath
,
with
all
his
pores
wide
open
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
to
return
to
the
Circus
:
it
is
inconvenient
from
its
situation
,
at
so
great
a
distance
from
all
the
markets
,
baths
,
and
places
of
public
entertainment
.
<EOS>
The
only
entrance
to
it
,
through
Gay
-
street
,
is
so
difficult
,
steep
,
and
slippery
,
that
,
in
wet
weather
,
it
must
be
exceedingly
dangerous
,
both
for
those
that
ride
in
carriages
,
and
those
that
walk
a
-
foot
;
and
when
the
street
is
covered
with
snow
,
as
it
was
for
fifteen
days
<EOS>
successively
this
very
winter
,
I
do
n't
see
how
any
individual
could
go
either
up
or
down
,
without
the
most
imminent
hazard
of
broken
bones
.
<EOS>
In
blowing
weather
,
I
am
told
,
most
of
the
houses
in
this
hill
are
smothered
with
smoke
,
forced
down
the
chimneys
,
by
the
gusts
of
wind
reverberated
from
the
hill
behind
,
which
(
I
apprehend
likewise
)
must
render
the
atmosphere
here
more
humid
and
unwholsome
than
it
is
in
the
square
below
;
for
the
clouds
,
formed
by
the
constant
evaporation
from
the
baths
and
rivers
in
the
bottom
,
will
,
in
their
ascent
this
way
,
be
first
attracted
and
detained
by
the
hill
that
rises
close
behind
the
Circus
,
and
load
the
air
with
a
perpetual
succession
of
vapours
:
this
point
,
however
,
may
be
easily
ascertained
by
means
of
an
hygrometer
,
or
a
paper
of
salt
of
tartar
exposed
to
the
action
of
the
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
The
same
artist
,
who
planned
the
Circus
,
has
likewise
projected
a
Crescent
;
when
that
is
finished
,
we
shall
probably
have
a
star
;
and
those
who
are
living
thirty
years
hence
,
may
perhaps
,
see
all
the
signs
of
the
Zodiac
exhibited
in
architecture
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
fantastical
,
are
still
designs
that
denote
some
ingenuity
and
knowledge
in
the
architect
;
but
the
rage
of
building
has
laid
hold
on
such
a
number
of
adventurers
,
that
one
sees
new
houses
starting
up
in
every
outlet
and
every
corner
of
Bath
;
contrived
without
judgment
,
executed
without
solidity
,
and
stuck
together
with
so
little
regard
to
plan
and
propriety
,
that
the
different
lines
of
the
new
rows
and
buildings
interfere
with
,
and
intersect
one
another
in
every
different
angle
of
conjunction
.
<EOS>
They
look
like
the
wreck
of
streets
and
squares
disjointed
by
an
earthquake
,
which
hath
broken
the
ground
into
a
variety
of
holes
and
hillocks
;
or
,
as
if
some
Gothic
devil
had
stuffed
them
altogether
in
a
bag
,
and
left
them
to
stand
higgledy
piggledy
,
just
as
chance
directed
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
a
monster
Bath
will
become
in
a
few
years
,
with
those
growing
excrescences
,
may
be
easily
conceived
:
but
the
want
of
beauty
and
proportion
is
not
the
worst
effect
of
these
new
mansions
;
they
are
built
so
slight
,
with
the
soft
crumbling
stone
found
in
this
neighbourhood
,
that
I
should
never
sleep
quietly
in
one
of
them
,
when
it
blowed
(
as
the
sailors
say
)
a
cap
-
full
of
wind
;
and
,
I
am
persuaded
,
that
my
hind
,
Roger
Williams
,
or
any
man
of
equal
strength
,
would
be
able
to
push
his
foot
through
the
strongest
part
of
their
walls
,
without
any
great
exertion
of
his
muscles
.
<EOS>
All
these
absurdities
arise
from
the
general
tide
of
luxury
,
which
hath
overspread
the
nation
,
and
swept
away
all
,
even
the
very
dregs
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
Every
upstart
of
fortune
,
harnassed
in
the
trappings
of
the
mode
,
presents
himself
at
Bath
,
as
in
the
very
focus
of
observation
  
Clerks
and
factors
from
the
East
Indies
,
loaded
with
the
spoil
of
plundered
provinces
;
planters
,
negro
-
drivers
,
and
hucksters
,
from
our
American
plantations
,
enriched
they
know
not
how
;
agents
,
commissaries
,
and
contractors
,
who
have
fattened
,
in
two
successive
wars
,
on
the
blood
of
the
nation
;
usurers
,
brokers
,
and
jobbers
of
every
kind
;
men
of
low
birth
,
and
no
breeding
,
have
found
themselves
suddenly
translated
into
a
state
of
affluence
,
unknown
to
former
ages
;
and
no
wonder
that
their
brains
should
be
intoxicated
with
pride
,
vanity
,
and
presumption
.
<EOS>
Knowing
no
other
criterion
of
greatness
,
but
the
ostentation
of
wealth
,
they
discharge
their
affluence
without
taste
or
conduct
,
through
every
channel
of
the
most
absurd
extravagance
:
and
all
of
them
hurry
to
Bath
because
here
,
without
any
further
qualification
,
they
can
mingle
with
the
princes
and
nobles
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
Even
the
wives
and
daughters
of
low
tradesmen
,
who
,
like
shovel
-
nosed
sharks
,
prey
upon
the
blubber
of
those
uncouth
whales
of
fortune
,
are
infected
with
the
same
rage
of
displaying
their
importance
;
and
the
slightest
indisposition
serves
them
for
a
pretext
to
insist
upon
being
conveyed
to
Bath
,
where
they
may
hobble
country
dances
and
cotillons
among
lordlings
,
"
squires
,
counsellors
,
and
clergy
.
<EOS>
These
delicate
creatures
from
Bedfordbury
,
Butcher
-
row
,
Crutched
-
Friars
,
and
Botolph
-
lane
,
can
not
Breathe
in
the
gross
air
of
the
Lower
Town
,
or
conform
to
the
vulgar
rules
of
a
common
lodging
-
house
;
the
husband
,
therefore
,
must
provide
an
entire
house
,
or
elegant
apartments
in
the
new
buildings
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
composition
of
what
is
called
the
fashionable
company
at
Bath
;
where
a
very
inconsiderable
proportion
of
genteel
people
are
lost
in
a
mob
of
impudent
plebeians
,
who
have
neither
understanding
nor
judgment
,
nor
the
least
idea
of
propriety
and
decorum
;
and
seem
to
enjoy
nothing
so
much
as
an
opportunity
of
insulting
their
betters
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
the
number
of
people
,
and
the
number
of
houses
,
continue
to
increase
;
and
this
will
ever
be
the
case
,
till
the
streams
that
swell
this
irresistible
torrent
of
folly
and
extravagance
,
shall
either
be
exhausted
,
or
turned
into
other
channels
,
by
incidents
and
events
which
I
do
not
pretend
to
foresee
.
<EOS>
This
,
I
own
,
is
a
subject
on
which
I
can
not
write
with
any
degree
of
patience
;
for
the
mob
is
a
monster
I
never
could
abide
,
either
in
its
head
,
tail
,
midriff
,
or
members
<EOS>
:
I
detest
the
whole
of
it
,
as
a
mass
of
ignorance
,
presumption
,
malice
,
and
brutality
;
and
,
in
this
term
of
reprobation
,
I
include
,
without
respect
of
rank
,
station
,
or
quality
,
all
those
of
both
sexes
,
who
affect
its
manners
,
and
court
its
society
.
    
<EOS>
But
I
have
written
till
my
fingers
are
crampt
,
and
my
nausea
begins
to
return
 
By
your
advice
,
I
sent
to
London
a
few
days
ago
for
half
a
pound
of
Gengzeng
;
though
I
doubt
much
,
whether
that
which
comes
from
America
is
equally
efficacious
with
what
is
brought
from
the
East
Indies
.
<EOS>
Some
years
ago
,
a
friend
of
mine
paid
sixteen
guineas
for
two
ounces
of
it
;
and
,
in
six
months
after
,
it
was
sold
in
the
same
shop
for
five
shillings
the
pound
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
live
in
a
vile
world
of
fraud
and
sophistication
;
so
that
I
know
nothing
of
equal
value
with
the
genuine
friendship
of
a
sensible
man
;
a
rare
jewel
!
<EOS>
which
I
can
not
help
thinking
myself
in
possession
of
,
while
I
repeat
the
old
declaration
,
that
I
am
,
as
usual
,
    
Dear
Lewis
,
Your
affectionate

<EOS>
After
having
been
agitated
in
a
short
hurricane
,
on
my
first
arrival
,
I
have
taken
a
small
house
in
Misham
-
street
,
where
I
am
tolerably
well
lodged
,
for
five
guineas
a
week
.
<EOS>
I
was
yesterday
at
the
Pump
-
room
,
and
drank
about
a
pint
of
the
water
,
which
seems
to
agree
with
my
stomach
;
and
to
-
morrow
morning
<EOS>
I
shall
bathe
,
for
the
first
time
;
<EOS>
so
that
in
a
few
posts
you
may
expect
farther
trouble
;
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
am
glad
to
find
that
the
inoculation
has
succeeded
so
well
with
poor
Joyce
,
and
that
her
face
will
be
but
little
marked
 
<EOS>
If
my
friend
Sir
Thomas
was
a
single
man
,
I
would
not
trust
such
a
handsome
wench
in
his
family
;
but
as
I
have
recommended
her
,
in
a
particular
manner
,
to
the
protection
of
lady
G

who
is
one
of
the
best
women
in
the
world

she
may
go
thither
without
hesitation
,
as
soon
as
she
is
quite
recovered
,
and
fit
for
service
 
<EOS>
Let
her
mother
have
money
to
provide
her
with
necessaries
,
and
she
may
ride
behind
her
brother
on
Bucks
;
but
you
must
lay
strong
injunctions
on
Jack

to
take
particular
care
of
his

MY
DEAREST
COMPANION
,
<EOS>
THE
pleasure
I
received
from
yours
,
which
came
to
hand
yesterday
,
is
not
to
be
expressed
.
<EOS>
Love
and
friendship
are
,
without
doubt
,
charming
passions
;
which
absence
serve
only
to
heighten
and
improve
.
<EOS>
Your
kind
present
of
the
garnet
bracelet
,
I
shall
keep
as
carefully
as
I
preserve
my
own
life
;
and
I
beg
you
will
accept
,
in
return
,
of
my
heart
-
housewife
,
with
the
tortoise
-
shell
memorandum
-
book
,
as
a
trifling
pledge
of
my
unalterable
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Bath
is
to
me
a
new
world
 
<EOS>
All
is
gayety
,
good
-
humour
,
and
diversion
.
<EOS>
The
eye
is
continually
entertained
with
the
splendor
of
dress
and
equipage
;
and
the
ear
with
the
sound
of
coaches
,
chaies
,
chairs
,
and
other
carriages
.
<EOS>
The
merry
bells
ring
round
,
from
morning
till
night
.
<EOS>
Then
we
are
welcomed
by
the
city
waifs
in
our
own
lodging
<EOS>
:
we
have
musick
in
the
pump
-
room
every
morning
,
cotillons
every
fore
-
noon
in
the
rooms
,
balls
twice
a
week
,
and
concerts
every
other
night
,
besides
private
assemblies
and
parties
without
number
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
were
settled
in
lodgings
,
we
were
visited
by
the
master
of
the
Ceremonies
;
pretty
little
gentleman
,
so
sweet
,
so
fine
,
so
civil
,
and
polite
,
that
in
our
country
he
might
pass
for
the
prince
of
Wales
,
then
he
talks
so
charmingly
,
both
in
verse
and
prose
,
that
you
would
be
delighted
to
hear
him
discourse
;
for
you
must
know
he
is
a
great
writer
,
and
has
got
five
tragedies
ready
for
the
stage
.
<EOS>
He
did
us
the
favour
to
dine
with
us
,
by
my
uncle
's
invitation
,
and
next
day
"
squired
my
aunt
and
me
to
every
parth
of
Bath
;
which
to
be
sure
is
an
earthly
paradise
.
<EOS>
The
Square
,
the
Circus
,
and
the
Parades
put
you
in
mind
of
the
sumptuous
palaces
represented
in
prints
and
pictures
;
and
the
new
buildings
,
such
as
Princes
-
row
,
Harlequin's
-
row
,
Bladud's
-
row
,
and
twenty
other
rows
,
look
like
so
many
enchanted
castles
,
raised
on
hanging
terraces
.
    
<EOS>
At
eight
in
the
morning
,
we
go
in
dishabille
to
the
Pump
-
room
;
which
is
crowded
like
a
Welsh
fair
;
and
there
you
see
the
highest
quality
,
and
the
lowest
trades
folks
,
jostling
each
other
,
without
ceremony
,
hail
fellow
well
met
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
musick
playing
in
the
gallery
,
the
heat
and
flavour
of
such
a
crowd
,
and
the
hum
and
buz
of
their
conversation
,
gave
me
the
head
-
ach
and
virtigo
the
first
day
;
but
afterwards
,
all
these
things
became
familiar
,
and
even
agreeable
.
  
<EOS>
Right
under
the
Pump
room
windows
is
the
King
's
Bath
;
a
huge
cistern
,
where
you
see
the
patients
up
to
their
necks
in
hot
water
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
wair
jackets
and
petticoats
of
brown
linen
,
with
chip
hats
,
in
which
they
fix
their
handkerchiefs
to
wipe
the
sweat
from
their
faces
;
but
,
truly
,
whether
it
is
owing
to
the
steam
that
surrounds
them
,
or
the
heat
of
the
water
,
or
the
nature
of
the
dress
,
or
to
all
these
causes
together
,
they
look
so
flushed
,
and
so
frightful
,
that
I
always
turn
my
eyes
another
way
 
<EOS>
My
aunt
,
who
says
every
person
of
fashion
should
make
her
appearance
in
the
bath
,
as
well
as
in
the
abby
church
,
contrived
a
cap
with
cherry
-
coloured
ribands
to
suit
her
complection
,
and
obliged
Win
to
attend
her
yesterday
morning
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
But
really
,
her
eyes
were
so
red
,
that
they
made
mine
water
as
I
viewed
her
from
the
Pump
-
room
;
and
as
for
poor
Win
,
who
wore
a
hat
trimmed
with
blue
,
what
betwixt
her
wan
complection
and
her
fear
,
she
looked
like
the
ghost
of
some
pale
maiden
,
who
had
drowned
herself
for
love
.
<EOS>
When
she
came
out
of
the
bath
,
she
took
assafoetida
drops
,
and
was
fluttered
all
day
;
so
that
we
could
hardly
keep
her
from
going
into
hysterics
:
but
her
mistress
says
it
will
do
her
good
;
and
poor
Win
curtsies
,
with
the
tears
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
content
myself
with
drinking
about
half
a
pint
of
the
water
every
morning
.
    
<EOS>
The
pumper
,
with
his
wife
and
servant
,
attend
within
a
bar
;
and
the
glasses
,
of
different
sizes
,
stand
ranged
in
order
before
them
,
so
that
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
point
at
that
which
you
choose
,
and
it
is
filled
immediately
,
hot
and
sparkling
from
the
pump
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
hot
water
I
could
ever
drink
,
without
being
sick
 
Far
from
having
that
effect
,
it
is
rather
agreable
to
the
taste
,
grateful
to
the
stomach
,
and
reviving
to
the
spirits
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
what
wonderful
cures
it
performs
 
My
uncle
began
with
it
the
other
day
;
but
he
made
wry
faces
in
drinking
,
and
I
'm
afraid
he
will
leave
it
off
 
<EOS>
The
first
day
we
came
to
Bath
,
he
fell
into
a
violent
passion
;
beat
two
black
-
a
-
moors
,
and
I
was
afraid
he
would
have
fought
with
their
master
;
but
the
stranger
proved
a
peaceable
man
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
gout
had
got
into
his
head
,
as
my
aunt
observed
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
believe
,
his
passion
drove
it
away
;
for
he
has
been
remarkably
well
ever
since
.
<EOS>
it
is
a
thousand
pities
he
should
ever
be
troubled
with
that
ugly
distemper
;
for
,
when
he
is
free
from
pain
,
he
is
the
best
tempered
man
upon
earth
;
so
gentle
,
so
generous
,
so
charitable
,
that
every
body
loves
him
;
and
so
good
to
me
<EOS>
,
in
particular
,
that
I
shall
never
be
able
to
shew
the
deep
sense
I
have
of
his
tenderness
and
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Hard
by
the
pump
room
,
is
a
coffee
house
for
the
ladies
;
but
my
aunt
says
,
young
girls
are
not
admitted
,
inasmuch
as
the
conversation
turns
upon
politics
,
scandal
,
philosophy
,
and
other
subjects
above
our
capacity
;
but
we
are
allowed
to
accompany
them
to
the
booksellers
shops
,
which
are
charming
places
of
resort
;
where
we
read
novels
,
plays
,
pamphlets
,
and
news
papers
,
for
so
small
a
subscription
as
a
crown
a
quarter
;
and
in
these
offices
of
intelligence
,
(
as
my
brother
calls
them
)
all
the
reports
of
the
day
,
and
all
the
private
transactions
of
the
Bath
,
are
first
entered
and
discussed
.
<EOS>
From
the
bookseller
's
shop
,
we
make
a
tour
through
the
milliners
and
toy
-
men
;
and
commonly
stop
at
Mr
Gill
's
,
the
pastry
-
cook
,
to
take
a
jelly
,
a
tart
,
or
a
small
bason
of
vermicelli
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
moreover
,
another
place
of
entertainment
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
opposite
to
the
Grove
;
to
which
the
company
cross
over
in
a
boat
 
<EOS>
It
is
called
Spring
Garden
;
a
sweet
retreat
,
laid
out
in
walks
and
ponds
,
and
parterres
of
flowers
;
and
there
is
a
long
room
for
breakfasting
and
dancing
.
<EOS>
As
the
situation
is
low
and
damp
,
and
the
season
has
been
remarkably
wet
,
my
uncle
wo
n't
suffer
me
to
go
thither
,
lest
I
should
catch
cold
:
but
my
aunt
says
it
is
all
a
vulgar
prejudice
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
a
great
many
gentlemen
and
ladies
of
Ireland
frequent
the
place
,
without
seeming
to
be
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
They
say
,
dancing
at
Spring
Gardens
,
when
the
air
is
moist
,
is
recommended
to
them
as
an
excellent
cure
for
the
rheumatism
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
twice
at
the
play
;
where
,
notwithstanding
the
excellence
of
the
performers
,
the
gaiety
of
the
company
,
and
the
decorations
of
the
theatre
,
which
are
very
fine
,
I
could
not
help
reflecting
,
with
a
sigh
,
upon
our
poor
homely
representations
at
Gloucester
 
<EOS>
But
this
,
in
confidence
to
my
dear
Willis
 
<EOS>
You
know
my
heart
and
will
excuse
its
weakness
.
     
<EOS>
After
all
,
the
great
scenes
of
entertainment
at
Bath
,
are
the
two
public
rooms
;
where
the
company
meet
alternately
every
evening
 
<EOS>
They
are
spacious
,
lofty
,
and
when
lighted
up
,
appear
very
striking
.
<EOS>
They
are
generally
crowded
with
well
-
dressed
people
,
who
drink
tea
in
seperate
parties
,
play
at
cards
,
walk
,
or
sit
and
chat
together
,
just
as
they
are
disposed
.
<EOS>
Twice
a
week
there
is
a
ball
;
the
expence
of
which
is
defrayed
by
a
voluntary
subscription
among
the
gentlemen
;
and
every
subscriber
has
three
tickets
.
<EOS>
I
was
there
Friday
last
with
my
aunt
,
under
the
care
of
my
brother
,
who
is
a
subscriber
;
and
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
recommended
his
nephew
,
captain
O
Donaghan
,
to
me
as
a
partner
;
but
Jery
excused
himself
,
by
saying
I
had
got
the
head
-
ach
;
and
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
it
was
really
so
,
though
I
ca
n't
imagine
how
he
knew
it
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
so
hot
,
and
the
smell
so
different
from
what
we
are
used
to
in
the
country
,
that
I
was
quite
feverish
when
we
came
away
.
<EOS>
Aunt
says
it
is
the
effect
of
a
vulgar
constitution
,
reared
among
woods
and
mountains
;
and
,
that
as
I
become
accustomed
to
genteel
company
,
it
will
wear
off
 
<EOS>
Sir
Ulic
was
very
complaisant
,
made
her
a
great
many
high
-
flown
compliments
;
and
when
we
retired
,
handed
her
with
great
ceremony
to
her
chair
.
<EOS>
The
captain
,
I
believe
,
would
have
done
me
the
same
favour
;
but
my
brother
,
seeing
him
advance
,
took
me
under
his
arm
,
and
wished
him
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
The
captain
is
a
pretty
man
,
to
be

there
is

boldness
in

But
I
am
afraid
I
have
put

this

assuring

Bath

DEAR
MOLLY
JONES
,
HEAVING
got
a
frank
,
I
now
return
your
fever
,
which
I
received
by
Mr
Higgins
,
at
the
Hot
Well
,
together
with
the
stockings
,
which
his
wife
footed
for
me
;
but
now
they
are
of
no
survice
.
<EOS>
No
body
wears
such
things
in
this
place
 
<EOS>
O
Molly
!
<EOS>
you
that
live
in
the
country
have
no
deception
of
our
doings
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
Here
is
such
dressing
,
and
fidling
,
and
dancing
,
and
gadding
,
and
courting
,
and
plotting
 
O
gracious
!
<EOS>
if
God
had
not
given
me
a
good
stock
of
discretion
,
what
a
power
of
things
might
not
I
reveal
,
consarning
old
mistress
and
young
mistress
;
Jews
with
beards
,
that
were
no
Jews
;
but
handsome
Christians
,
without
a
hair
upon
their
sin
,
strolling
with
spectacles
,
to
get
speech
of
Miss
Liddy
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
a
dear
sweet
soul
,
as
innocent
as
the
child
unborn
.
<EOS>
She
has
tould
me
all
her
inward
thoughts
,
and
disclosed
her
passion
for
Mr
Wilson
;
and
that
's
not
his
name
neither
;
and
thof
he
acted
among
the
player
-
men
,
he
is
meat
for
their
masters
;
and
she
has
gi'en
me
her
yallow
trollopea
;
which
Mrs
Drab
,
the
manty

maker
,
says
will
look
very
well
when
it
is
scowred
and
smoaked
with

<EOS>
God
he
knows
what
havock
I
shall
make
among
the
mail
-
sex
,
when
I
make
my
first
appearance
in
this
killing
collar
,
with
a
full
soot
of
gaze
,
as
good
as
new
,
that
I
bought
last
Friday
of
madam
Friponeau
,
the
French
mullaner
  
<EOS>
Dear
girl
,
I
have
seen
all
the
fine
shews
of
Bath
;
the
Prades
,
the
Squires
,
and
the
Circlis
,
the
Crashit
,
the
Hottogon
,
and
bloody
Buildings
,
and
Harry
King
's
row
;
and
I
have
been
twice
in
the
Bath
with
mistress
,
and
na'r
a
smoak
upon
our
backs
,
hussy
 
<EOS>
The
first
time
I
was
mortally
afraid
,
and
flustered
all
day
;
and
afterwards
made
believe
that
I
had
got
the
heddick
;
but
mistress
said
,
if
I
did'nt
go
,
I
should
take
a
dose
of
bum
-
taffy
;
and
so
remembring
how
it
worked
Mrs
Gwyllim
a
pennorth
,
I
chose
rather
to
go
again
with
her
into
the
Bath
,
and
then
I
met
with
an
axident
.
<EOS>
I
dropt
my
petticoat
,
and
could
not
get
it
up
from
the
bottom
  
<EOS>
But
what
did
that
signify
?
<EOS>
they
mought
laff
,
but
they
could
see
nothing
;
for
I
was
up
to
the
sin
in
water
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
it
threw
me
into
such
a
gumbustion
,
that
I
know
not
what
I
said
,
nor
what
I
did
,
nor
how
they
got
me
out
,
and
rapt
me
in
a
blanket
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
scoulded
a
little
when
we
got
home
;
but
she
knows
as
I
know
what
's
<EOS>
what
 
<EOS>
Ah
Laud
help
you
!
  
<EOS>
There
is
Sir
Yury
Micligut
,
of
Balnaclinch
,
in
the
cunty
of
Kalloway
 
<EOS>
I
took
down
the
name
from
his
gentleman
,
Mr
O
Frizzle
,
and
he
has
got
an
estate
of
fifteen
hundred
a
year
  
<EOS>
I
am
sure
he
is
both
rich
and
generous
 
<EOS>
But
you
nose
,
Molly
,
I
was
always
famous
for
keeping
secrets
;
and
so
he
was
very
safe
in
trusting
me
with
his
flegm
for
mistress
;
which
,
to
be
sure
,
is
very
honourable
;
for
Mr
O
Frizzle
assures
me
,
he
values
not
her
portion
a
brass
varthing
 
<EOS>
And
,
indeed
,
what
's
poor
ten
thousand
pounds
to
a
Baron
Knight
of
his
fortune
?
<EOS>
and
,
truly
,
I
told
Mr
O
Frizzle
,
that
was
all
she
had
to
trust
to
 
<EOS>
As
for
John
Thomas
,
he
's
a
morass
fellor
 
<EOS>
I
vow
<EOS>
,
I
thought
he
would
a
fit
with
Mr
O
Frizzle
,
because
he
axed
me
to
dance
with
him
at
Spring
Garden
 
<EOS>
But
God
he
knows
I
have
no
thoughts
eyther
of
wan
or
t'other
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
house
news
,
the
worst
is
,
Chowder
has
fallen
off
greatly
from
his
stomick
 
<EOS>
He
eats
nothing
but
white
meats
,
and
not
much
of
that
;
and
wheezes
,
and
seems
to
be
much
bloated
.
<EOS>
The
doctors
think
he
is
threatened
with
a
dropsy
 
Parson
Marrowfat
,
who
has
got
the
same
disorder
,
finds
great
benefit
from
the
waters
;
but
Chowder
seems
to
like
them
no
better
than
the
"
squire
;
and
mistress
says
,
if
his
case
do
n't
take
a
favourable
turn
,
she
will
sartainly
carry
him
to
Aberga'nny
,
to
drink
goats's
-
whey
 
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
poor
dear
honymil
is
lost
for
want
of
axercise
;
for
which
reason
,
she
intends
to
give
him
an
airing
once
a
-
day
upon
the
Downs
,
in
a
post

chaise
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
made
very
creditable
correxions
in
this
here
place
;
where
,
to
be
sure
,
we
have
the
very
squintasense
of
satiety
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Patcher
,
my
lady
Kilmacullock
's
woman
,
and
I
are
sworn
sisters
.
<EOS>
She
has
shewn
me
all
her
secrets
,
and
learned
me
to
wash
gaze
,
and
refrash
rusty
silks
and
bumbeseens
,
by
boiling
them
with
vinegar
,
chamberlye
,
and
stale

My

and
my

But
this
is
all
Greek

If

you

If

remember

<EOS>
I
AM
astonished
,
that
Dr
Lewis
should
take
upon
him
to
give
away
Alderney
,
without
my
privity
and
concurrants
 
<EOS>
What
signifies
my
brother
's
order
?
<EOS>
My
brother
is
little
better
than
Noncompush
.
<EOS>
He
would
give
away
the
shirt
off
his
back
,
and
the
teeth
out
of
his
head
;
nay
,
as
for
that
matter
,
he
would
have
ruinated
the
family
with
his
riciculous
charities
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
my
four
quarters
 
What
between
his
willfulness
and
his
waste
,
his
trumps
,
and
his
frenzy
,
I
lead
the
life
of
an
indented
slave
.
<EOS>
Alderney
gave
four
gallons
a
-
day
,
ever
since
the
calf
was
sent
to
market
.
<EOS>
There
is
so
much
milk
out
of
my
dairy
,
and
the
press
must
stand
still
:
but
I
wo
n't
loose
a
cheese
paring
;
and
the
milk
shall
be
made
good
,
if
the
sarvents
should
go
without
butter
.
<EOS>
If
they
must
needs
have
butter
,
let
them
make
it
of
sheep
's
milk
;
but
then
my
wool
will
suffer
for
want
of
grace
;
so
that
I
must
be
a
looser
on
all
sides
 
<EOS>
Well
,
patience
is
like
a
stout
Welsh
poney
;
it
bears
a
great
deal
,
and
trots
a
great
way
;
but
it
will
tire
at
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
Before
its
long
,
perhaps
I
may
shew
Matt
,
that
I
was
not
born
to
be
the
household
drudge
to
my
dying
day
 
<EOS>
Gwyn
rites
from
Crickhowel
,
that
the
price
of
flannel
is
fallen
three
-
farthings
an
ell
;
and
that
's
another
good
penny
out
of
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
When
I
go
to
market
to
sell
,
my
commodity
stinks
;
but
when
I
want
to
buy
the
commonest
thing
,
the
owner
pricks
it
up
under
my
nose
;
and
it
ca
n't
be
had
for
love
nor
money
 
<EOS>
I
think
every
thing
runs
cross
at
Brambleton
-
hall
  
<EOS>
You
say
the
gander
has
broke
the
eggs
,
which
is
a
phinumenon
I
do
n't
understand
;
for
when
the
fox
carried
off
the
old
goose
last
year
,
he
took
her
place
,
and
hatched
the
eggs
,
and
partected
the
goslings
like
a
tender
parent
 
<EOS>
Then
you
tell
me
the
thunder
has
soured
two
barrels
of
beer
in
the
seller
.
<EOS>
But
how
the
thunder
should
get
there
,
when
the
seller
was
double
-
locked
,
I
ca
n't
comprehend
.
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
I
wo
n't
have
the
beer
thrown
out
,
till
I
see
it
with
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
it
will
recover
 
At
least
it
will
serve
for
vinegar
to
the
sarvents
.
<EOS>
You
may
leave
off
the
fires
in
my
brother
's
chamber
and
mine
,
as
it
is
unsartain
when
we
return
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
Gwyllim
,
you
'll
take
care
there
is
no
waste
;
and
have
an
eye
to
the
maids
,
and
keep
them
to
their
spinning
.
<EOS>
I
think
they
may
go
very
well
without
beer
in
hot
weather
 
<EOS>
It
serves
only
to
inflame
the
blood
and
set
them
a
-
gog
after
the
men
.
<EOS>
Water
will
make
them
fair
,
and
keep
them
cool
and

<EOS>
Do
n't
forget
to
put
up

along

the

<EOS>
DEAR
DICK
,
I
HAVE
done
with
the
waters
;
therefore
your
advice
comes
a
day
too
late
 
<EOS>
I
grant
<EOS>
that
physick
is
no
mystery
of
your
making
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
a
mystery
in
its
own
nature
;
and
,
like
other
mysteries
,
requires
a
strong
gulp
of
faith
to
make
it
go
down
  
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
,
I
went
into
the
King
's
Bath
,
by
the
advice
of
our
friend
Ch
#
#
#
#
,
in
order
to
clear
the
strainer
of
the
skin
,
for
the
benefit
of
a
free
perspiration
;
and
the
first
object
that
saluted
my
eye
,
was
a
child
full
of
scrophulous
ulcers
,
carried
in
the
arms
of
one
of
the
guides
,
under
the
very
noses
of
the
bathers
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
shocked
at
the
sight
,
that
I
retired
immediately
with
indignation
and
disgust
 
<EOS>
Suppose
the
matter
of
those
ulcers
,
floating
on
the
water
,
comes
in
contact
with
my
skin
,
when
the
pores
are
all
open
,
I
would
ask
you
what
must
be
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
Good
Heaven
,
the
very
thought
makes
my
blood
run
cold
;
we
know
not
what
sorea
may
be
running
into
the
water
while
we
are
bathing
,
and
what
sort
of
matter
we
may
thus
imbibe
;
the
king's
-
evil
,
the
scurvy
,
the
cancer
,
and
the
pox
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
the
heat
will
render
the
virus
the
more
volatile
and
penetrating
.
<EOS>
To
purify
myself
from
all
such
contamination
,
I
went
to
the
duke
of
Kingston
's
private
Bath
,
and
there
I
was
almost
suffocated
for
want
of
free
air
;
the
place
was
so
small
,
and
the
steam
so
stifling
.
    
<EOS>
After
all
,
if
the
intention
is
no
more
than
to
wash
the
skin
,
I
am
convinced
that
simple
element
is
more
effectual
than
any
water
impregnated
with
salt
and
iron
;
which
,
being
astringent
,
will
certainly
contract
the
pores
,
and
leave
a
kind
of
crust
upon
the
surface
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
now
as
much
afraid
of
drinking
,
as
of
bathing
;
for
,
after
a
long
conversation
with
the
Doctor
,
about
the
construction
of
the
pump
and
the
cistern
,
it
is
very
far
from
being
clear
with
me
,
that
the
patients
in
the
Pump
-
room
do
n't
swallow
,
the
scourings
of
the
bathers
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
suspecting
,
that
there
is
,
or
may
be
,
some
regurgitation
from
the
bath
into
the
cistern
of
the
pump
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
what
a
delicate
beveridge
is
every
day
quaffed
by
the
drinkers
;
medicated
with
the
sweat
,
and
dirt
,
and
dandriff
;
and
the
abominable
discharges
of
various
kinds
,
from
twenty
different
diseased
bodies
,
parboiling
in
the
kettle
below
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
avoid
this
filthy
composition
,
I
had
recourse
to
the
spring
that
supplies
the
private
baths
on
the
Abbey
-
green
;
but
I
at
once
perceived
something
extraordinary
in
the
taste
and
smell
;
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
I
find
that
the
Roman
baths
in
this
quarter
,
were
found
covered
by
an
old
burying
ground
,
belonging
to
the
Abbey
;
thro
'
which
,
in
all
probability
,
the
water
drains
in
its
passage
.
<EOS>
so
that
as
we
drink
the
decoction
of
living
bodies
at
the
Pump
-
room
,
we
swallow
the
strainings
of
rotten
bones
and
carcases
at
the
private
bath
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
God
<EOS>
,
the
very
idea
turns
my
stomach
!
 
<EOS>
determined
,
as
I
am
,
against
any
farther
use
of
the
Bath
waters
,
this
consideration
would
give
me
little
disturbance
,
if
I
could
find
any
thing
more
pure
,
or
less
pernicious
,
to
quench
my
thirst
;
but
,
although
the
natural
springs
of
excellent
water
are
seen
gushing
spontaneous
on
every
side
,
from
the
hills
that
surround
us
,
the
inhabitants
in
general
,
make
use
of
well
-
water
,
so
impregnated
with
nitre
,
or
alum
,
or
some
other
villanous
mineral
,
that
it
is
equally
ungrateful
to
the
taste
,
and
mischievous
to
the
constitution
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
indeed
,
that
here
,
in
Milshamstreet
,
we
have
a
precarious
and
scanty
supply
from
the
hill
;
which
is
collected
in
an
open
bason
in
the
Circus
,
liable
to
be
defiled
with
dead
dogs
,
cats
,
rats
,
and
every
species
of
nastiness
,
which
the
rascally
populace
may
throw
into
it
,
from
mere
wantonness
and
brutality
.
     
<EOS>
Well
,
there
is
no
nation
that
drinks
so
hoggishly
,
as
the
English
 
<EOS>
What
passes
for
wine
among
us
,
is
not
the
juice
of
the
grape
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
adulterous
mixture
,
brewed
up
of
nauseous
ingredients
,
by
dunces
,
who
are
bunglers
in
the
art
of
poison
-
making
;
and
yet
we
,
and
our
forefathers
,
are
and
have
been
poisoned
by
this
cursed
drench
,
without
taste
or
flavour
 
<EOS>
The
only
genuine
and
wholesome
beveridge
in
England
,
is
London
-
porter
,
and
Dorchester
table
-
beer
;
but
as
for
your
ale
and
your
gin
,
your
cider
,
and
your
perry
,
and
all
the
trashy
family
of
made
wines
,
I
detest
them
as
infernal
compositions
,
contrived
for
the
destruction
of
the
human
species
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
have
I
to
do
with
the
human
species
?
<EOS>
except
a
very
few
friends
,
I
care
not
if
the
whole
was
     
Hark
ye
,
Lewis
<EOS>
,
my
misanthropy
increases
every
day
 
<EOS>
The
longer
I
live
,
I
find
the
folly
and
the
fraud
of
mankind
grow
more
and
more
intolerable
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
not
come
from
Brambleton
hall
;
after
having
lived
in
solitude
so
long
,
I
can
not
bear
the
hurry
and
impertinence
of
the
multitude
;
besides
every
thing
is
sophisticated
in
these
crowded
places
.
<EOS>
Snares
are
laid
for
our
lives
in
every
thing
we
eat
or
drink
:
the
very
air
we
breathe
,
is
loaded
with
contagion
.
<EOS>
We
can
not
even
sleep
,
without
risque
of
insection
.
<EOS>
I
say
,
infection
 
<EOS>
This
place
is
the
rendezvous
of
the
diseased
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
deny
,
that
many
diseases
are
infections
;
even
the
consumption
itself
,
is
highly
infections
.
<EOS>
When
a
person
dies
of
it
in
Italy
,
the
bed
and
bedding
are
destroyed
;
the
other
furniture
is
exposed
to
the
weather
,
and
the
apartment
white
-
washed
,
before
it
is
occupied
by
any
other
living
soul
.
<EOS>
You
'll
allow
,
that
nothing
receives
infection
sooner
,
or
retains
it
longer
,
than
blankets
,
feather
-
beds
,
and
matrasses
 
<EOS>
"
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
how
do
I
know
what
miserable
objects
have
been
stewing
in
the
bed
where
I
now
lie
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
,
Dick
,
you
did
not
put
me
in
mind
of
sending
for
my
own
matrasses
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
I
had
not
been
an
ass
,
I
should
not
have
needed
a
remembrancer
  
<EOS>
There
is
always
some
plaguy
reflection
that
rises
up
in
judgment
against
me
,
and
ruffles
my
spirits
 
Therefore
,
let
us
change
the
subject
     
<EOS>
I
have
other
reasons
for
abridging
my
stay
at
Bath
 
<EOS>
You
know
sister
Tabby
's
complexion
 
<EOS>
If
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
had
been
of
any
other
race
,
I
should
certainly
have
looked
upon
her
as
the
most
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
truth
is
,
she
has
found
means
to
interest
my
affection
;
or
,
rather
,
she
is
beholden
to
the
force
of
prejudice
,
commonly
called
the
ties
of
blood
.
<EOS>
Well
,
this
amiable
maiden
has
actually
commenced
a
flirting
correspondence
with
an
Irish
baronel
of
sixty
-
five
.
<EOS>
His
name
is
sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
.
<EOS>
He
is
said
to
be
much
out
at
elbows
;
and
,
I
believe
,
has
received
false
intelligence
with
respect
to
her
fortune
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
the
connexion
is
exceedingly
ridiculous
,
and
begins
already
to
excite
whispers
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
have
no
intention
to
dispute
her
free
agency
;
though
I
shall
fall
upon
some
expedient
to
undeceive
her
paramour
,
as
to
the
point
which
he
has
principally
in
view
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
her
conduct
in
a
proper
example
for
Liddy
,
who
has
also
attracted
the
notice
of
some
coxcombs
in
the
rooms
;
and
Jery
tells
me
,
he
suspects
a
strapping
fellow
,
the
knight
's
nephew
,
of
some
design
upon
the
girl
's
heart
.
<EOS>
I
shall
,
therefore
,
keep
a
strict
eye
over
her
aunt
and
her
,
and
even
shift
the
scene
,
if
I
find
the
matter
grow
more
serious
 
<EOS>
You
perceive
what
an
agreeable
task
it
must
be
,
to
a
man
of
my
kidney
,
to
have
the
cure
of
such
souls
as
these
 
<EOS>
But
,
hold
,
you
shall
not
have
another
peevish
word

till
the
next
occasion

<EOS>
DEAR
KNIGHT
,
I
THINK
those
people
are
unreasonable
,
who
complain
that
Bath
is
a
contracted
circle
,
in
which
the
same
dull
scenes
perpetually
revolve
,
without
variation
 
<EOS>
I
am
,
on
the
contrary
,
amazed
to
find
so
small
a
place
,
so
crowded
with
entertainment
and
variety
.
<EOS>
London
itself
can
hardly
exhibit
one
species
of
diversion
,
to
which
we
have
not
something
analogous
at
Bath
,
over
and
above
those
singular
advantages
that
are
peculiar
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Here
,
for
example
a
man
has
daily
opportunities
of
seeing
the
most
remarkable
characters
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
He
sees
them
in
their
natural
attitudes
and
true
colours
;
descended
from
their
pedestals
,
and
divested
of
their
formal
draperies
,
undisguised
by
art
and
affectation
 
Here
,
we
have
ministers
of
slate
,
judges
,
generals
,
bishops
,
projectors
,
philosophers
,
wise
,
poets
,
players
,
chemists
,
fiddlers
,
and
bussoons
.
<EOS>
If
he
makes
any
considerable
stay
in
the
place
,
he
is
sure
of
meeting
with
some
particular
friend
,
whom
he
did
not
expect
to
see
;
and
to
me
there
is
nothing
more
agreeable
,
than
such
casual
rencounters
 
Another
entertainment
,
peculiar
to
Bath
,
arises
from
the
general
mixture
of
all
degrees
assembled
in
our
public
rooms
,
without
distinction
of
rank
or
fortune
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
my
uncle
reprobates
,
as
a
monstrous
jumble
of
heterogeneous
principles
;
a
vile
mob
of
noise
and
impertinence
,
without
decency
or
subordination
.
<EOS>
But
this
chaos
is
to
me
a
source
of
infinite
amusement
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
extremely
diverted
,
last
ball
-
night
,
to
see
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
leading
,
with
great
solemnity
,
to
the
upper
end
of
the
room
,
<EOS>
an
antiquated
Abigail
,
dressed
in
her
lady
's
cast
-
clothes
;
whom
he
(
I
suppose
)
mistook
for
some
countess
just
arrived
at
the
Bath
.
<EOS>
The
ball
was
opened
by
a
Scotch
lord
,
with
a
mulatto
heiress
from
St.
Christopher
's
;
and
the
gay
colonel
Tinsel
danced
all
the
evening
with
the
daughter
of
an
eminent
tinman
from
the
borough
of
Southwark
 
<EOS>
Yesterday
morning
,
at
the
Pump
-
room
,
I
saw
a
broken
-
winded
Wapping
landlady
squeeze
through
a
circle
of
peers
,
to
salute
her
brandy
merchant
,
who
stood
by
the
window
,
prop'd
upon
crutches
;
and
a
paralytic
attorney
of
Shoe
-
lane
,
in
shufling
up
to
the
bar
,
kicked
the
shins
of
the
chancellor
of
England
,
while
his
lordship
,
in
a
cut
bob
,
drank
a
glass
of
water
at
the
pump
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
account
for
my
being
pleased
with
these
incidents
,
any
other
way
than
by
saying
,
they
are
truly
ridiculous
in
their
own
nature
,
and
serve
to
heighten
the
humour
in
the
farce
of
life
,
which
I
am
determined
to
enjoy
as
long
as
I
can
.
     
<EOS>
Those
,
follies
that
move
my
uncle
's
spleen
excite
my
laughter
.
<EOS>
He
is
as
tender
as
a
man
without
a
skin
;
who
can
not
bear
the
slightest
touch
without
slinching
.
<EOS>
What
tickles
another
would
give
him
torment
;
and
yet
he
has
what
we
may
call
lucid
intervals
,
when
he
is
remarkably
facetious
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
never
know
a
hypochondraic
<EOS>
so
apt
to
be
infected
with
good
-
humour
.
<EOS>
He
is
the
most
risible
misanthrope
I
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
A
lucky
joke
,
or
any
ludicrous
incident
,
will
set
him
a
-
laughing
immoderately
,
even
in
one
of
his
most
gloomy
paroxysms
;
and
when
the
laugh
is
over
,
he
will
curse
his
own
imbecility
.
<EOS>
In
conversing
with
strangers
,
he
betrays
no
marks
of
disquiet
 
<EOS>
He
is
splenetic
with
his
familiars
only
;
and
not
even
with
them
,
while
they
keep
his
attention
employed
;
but
when
his
spirits
are
not
exerted
externally
,
they
seem
to
recoil
and
to
prey
upon
himself
 
<EOS>
He
has
renounced
the
waters
with
execration
;
but
he
begins
to
find
a
more
efficacious
,
and
,
certainly
,
a
much
more
palatable
remedy
in
the
pleasures
of
society
.
<EOS>
He
has
discovered
some
old
friends
,
among
the
invalids
of
Bath
;
and
,
in
particular
,
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
the
celebrated
James
Quin
,
who
certainly
did
not
come
here
to
drink
water
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
doubt
,
but
that
I
had
the
strongest
curiosity
to
know
this
original
;
and
it
was
gratified
by
Mr
Bramble
,
who
has
had
him
twice
at
our
house
to
dinner
.
    
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
,
Quin
's
character
is
rather
more
respectable
than
it
has
been
generally
represented
.
<EOS>
His
bon
mots
are
in
every
witling
's
mouth
;
but
many
of
them
have
a
rank
flavour
,
which
one
would
be
apt
to
think
was
derived
from
a
natural
grossness
of
idea
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
,
however
,
that
justice
has
not
been
done
the
author
,
by
the
collectors
of
those
Quiniania
;
who
have
let
the
best
of
them
slip
through
their
fingers
,
and
only
retained
such
as
were
suited
to
the
taste
and
organs
of
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
How
far
he
may
relax
in
his
hours
of
jollity
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
;
but
his
general
conversation
is
conducted
by
the
nicest
rules
of
propriety
;
and
Mr
James
Quin
is
,
certainly
,
one
the
best
bred
men
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
only
a
most
agreeable
companion
;
but
(
as
I
am
credibly
informed
)
a
very
honest
man
;
highly
sum
ceptible
of
friendship
,
warm
steady
,
and
evesgenerous
in
his
attachments
;
disdaining
flattery
and
incapable
of
meaness
and
dissimulation
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
judge
,
however
from
Quin
's
eye
alone
<EOS>
I
should
take
him
to
be
proud
,
insolent
,
and
cruel
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
remarkably
severe
and
forbidding
in
his
aspect
;
and
,
I
have
been
told
,
he
was
ever
disposed
to
insult
his
inferiors
and
dependants
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
report
has
influenced
my
opinion
of
his
looks
 
<EOS>
You
know
we
are
the
fools
of
prejudice
.
<EOS>
Howsoever
that
may
be
,
I
have
as
yet
seen
nothing
but
his
favourable
side
:
and
my
uncle
,
who
frequently
confers
with
him
in
a
corner
,
declares
he
is
one
of
the
most
sensible
men
he
ever
knew
 
<EOS>
He
seems
to
have
a
reciprocal
regard
for
old
Square
-
toes
,
whom
he
calls
by
the
familiar
name
of
Matthew
,
and
often
reminds
of
their
old
tavern
-
adventures
:
on
the
other
hand
,
Matthew
's
eyes
sparkle
whenever
Quin
makes
his
appearance
 
Let
him
be
never
so
jarring
and
discordant
,
Quin
puts
him
in
tune
;
and
,
like
treble
and
bass
in
the
same
concert
,
they
make
excellent
musick
together
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
the
conversation
turning
upon
Shakespeare
,
I
could
not
help
saying
,
with
some
emotion
,
that
I
would
give
an
hundred
guineas
to
see
Mr
Quin
act
the
part
of
Falstaff
;
upon
which
,
turning
to
me
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
And
I
would
give
a
thousand
,
young
gentleman
,
(
said
he
)
that
I
could
gratify
your
longing
.
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
and
he
are
perfectly
agreed
in
their
estimate
of
life
;
which
Quin
says
,
would
stink
in
his
nostrils
,
if
he
did
not
steep
it
in
claret
.
    
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
this
phenomenon
in
his
cups
;
and
have
almost
prevailed
upon
my
uncle
to
give
him
a
small
turtle
at
the
Bear
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
I
must
entertain
you
with
an
incident
,
that
seems
to
confirm
the
judgment
of
those
two
cynic
philosophers
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
liberty
to
differ
in
opinion
from
Mr
Bramble
,
when
he
observed
,
that
the
mixture
of
people
in
the
entertainments
of
this
place
was
destructive
of
all
order
and
urbanity
;
that
it
rendered
the
plebeians
insufferably
arrogant
and
troublesome
,
and
vulgarized
the
deportment
and
sentiments
of
those
who
moved
in
the
upper
spheres
of
life
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
such
a
preposterous
coalition
would
bring
us
into
contempt
with
all
our
neighbours
;
and
was
worse
in
fact
than
debasing
the
gold
coin
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
I
argued
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
those
plebeians
who
discovered
such
eagerness
to
imitate
the
dress
and
equipage
of
their
superiors
,
would
likewise
in
time
,
adopt
their
maxims
and
their
manners
be
polished
by
their
conversation
,
and
refined
by
their
example
,
but
when
I
appealed
to
Mr
Quin
,
and
asked
if
he
did
not
think
that
such
an
unreserved
mixture
would
improve
the
whole
mass
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
(
said
he
)
as
a
plate
of
marmalade
would
improve
a
pan
of
sirreverence
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
owned
I
was
not
much
conversant
in
high
-
life
,
but
I
had
seen
what
were
called
polite
assemblies
in
London
and
elswhere
;
that
those
of
Bath
seemed
to
be
as
decent
as
any
;
and
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
the
individuals
that
composed
it
,
would
not
be
found
deficient
in
good
manners
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
"
But
let
us
have
recourse
to
experience
,
(
said
I
)
  
<EOS>
Jack
Holder
,
who
was
intended
for
a
parson
,
has
succeeded
to
an
estate
of
two
thousand
a
year
by
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
at
the
Bath
,
driving
about
in
a
phaeton
and
sour
,
with
French
horns
.
<EOS>
He
has
treated
with
turtle
and
claret
at
all
the
taverns
in
Bath
and
Bristol
,
till
his
guests
are
gorged
with
good
chear
:
he
has
bought
a
dozen
suits
of
fine
clothes
,
by
the
advice
of
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
under
whose
tuition
he
has
entered
himself
:
he
has
lost
some
hundreds
at
billiards
to
sharpers
,
and
taken
one
of
the
nymphs
of
Avon
-
street
into
keeping
;
but
,
finding
all
these
channells
insufficient
to
drain
him
of
his
current
cash
,
his
counsellor
has
engaged
him
to
give
a
general
tea
-
drinking
to
-
morrow
at
Wiltshire
's
room
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
give
it
the
more
ecclat
,
every
table
is
to
be
furnished
with
sweet
-
meats
and
nosegays
;
which
,
however
,
are
not
to
be
touched
till
notice
is
given
by
the
ringing
of
a
bell
,
and
then
the
ladies
may
help
themselves
without
restriction
.
<EOS>
This
will
be
no
bad
way
of
trying
the
company
's
breeding
 
"
    
"
I
will
abide
by
that
experiment
,
(
cried
my
uncle
)
and
if
I
could
find
a
place
to
stand
secure
,
without
the
vortex
of
the
tumult
,
which
I
know
will
ensue
,
I
would
certainly
go
thither
and
enjoy
the
scene
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quin
proposed
that
we
should
take
our
station
in
the
musick
-
gallery
;
and
we
took
his
advice
.
<EOS>
Holder
had
got
thither
before
us
,
with
his
horns
perdue
;
but
we
were
admitted
.
<EOS>
The
tea
-
drinking
passed
as
usual
;
and
the
company
having
risen
from
the
tables
,
were
sauntering
in
groupes
,
in
expectation
of
the
signal
for
attack
,
when
the
bell
beginning
to
ring
,
they
flew
with
eagerness
to
the
desart
,
and
the
whole
place
was
instantly
in
commotion
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
but
justling
,
scrambling
,
pulling
,
snatching
,
struggling
,
scolding
,
and
screaming
.
<EOS>
The
nosegays
were
torn
from
one
another
's
hands
and
bosoms
;
the
glasses
and
china
went
to
wreck
;
the
tables
and
floor
were
strewed
with
comfits
.
<EOS>
Some
cried
;
some
swore
;
and
the
tropes
and
figures
of
Billingsgate
were
used
without
reserve
in
all
their
native
zest
and
flavour
;
nor
were
those
flowers
of
rhetoric
unattended
with
significant
gesticulation
.
<EOS>
Some
snapped
their
fingers
;
some
forked
them
out
;
some
clapped
their
hands
,
and
some
their
back
-
sides
;
at
legth
,
they
fairly
proceeded
to
pulling
caps
,
and
every
thing
seemed
to
presage
a
general
battle
;
when
Holder
ordered
his
horns
to
sound
a
change
with
a
view
to
annimate
the
combatants
,
and
inflame
the
contest
;
but
this
manoeuvre
produced
an
effect
quite
contrary
to
what
he
expected
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
note
of
reproach
that
roused
them
to
an
immediate
sense
of
their
disgraceful
situation
.
<EOS>
They
were
ashamed
of
their
absurd
deportment
,
and
suddenly
desisted
.
<EOS>
They
gathered
up
their
caps
,
rustles
,
and
handkerchiefs
;
and
great
part
of
them
retired
in
silent
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
Quin
laughed
at
this
adventure
;
but
my
uncle
's
delicacy
was
hurt
.
<EOS>
He
hung
his
head
in
manifest
chagrin
,
and
seemed
to
repine
at
the
triumph
of
his
judgment
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
his
victory
was
more
complete
than
he
imagined
;
for
,
as
we
afterwards
learned
,
the
two
amazons
who
singularized
themselves
most
in
the
action
,
did
not
come
from
the
purlies
of
Puddle
-
dock
,
but
from
the
courtly
neighbourhood
of
St.
James
's
palace
.
<EOS>
One
was
a
baroness
,
and
the
other
a
wealthy
knight
's
dowager
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
spoke
not
a
word
,
till
we
had
made
our
retreat
good
to
the
coffee
-
house
;
where
,
taking
off
his
hat
and
wiping
his
forehead
,
"
I
bless
God
(
said
he
)
that
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
did
not
take
the
field
today
!
"
<EOS>
"
I
would
pit
her
for
a
cool
hundred
(
cried
Quin
)
against
the
best
shake
-
bag
of
the
whole
main
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
nothing
could
have
kept
her
at
home
but
the
accident
of
her
having
taken
physick
before
she
knew
the
nature
of
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
for
some
days
furbishing
up
an
old
suit
of
black
velvet
,
to
make
her
appearance
as
Sir
Ulic
's
partner
at
the
next
ball
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
much
to
say
of
this
amiable
kinswoman
;
but
she
has
not
been
properly
introduced
to
your
acquaintance
,
She
is
remarkably
civil
to
Mr
Quin
;
of
whose
sarcastic
humour
<EOS>
she
seems
to
stand
in
awe
;
but
her
caution
is
no
match
for
her
impertinence
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Gwynn
,
(
said
she
the
other
day
)
<EOS>
I
was
once
vastly
entertained
with
your
playing
the
Ghost
of
Gimlet
at
Drury
-
lane
,
when
you
rose
up
through
the
stage
,
with
a
white
face
and
red
eyes
,
and
spoke
of
quails
upon
the
frightful
por
cofine
 
Do
,
pray
,
spout
a
little
the
Ghost
of
Gimlet
.
"
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
(
said
Quin
,
with
a
glance
of
ineffable
disdain
)
<EOS>
the
Ghost
of
Gimlet
is
laid
,
never
to
rise
again
 
"
Insensible
of
his
check
,
she
proceeded
:
"
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
you
looked
and
talked
so
like
a
real
ghost
;
and
then
the
cock
crowed
so
natural
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
you
could
teach
him
to
crow
so
exact
,
in
the
very
nick
of
time
;
but
I
suppose
,
he
's
game
 
An't
<EOS>
he
game
,
Mr
Gwynn
?
<EOS>
"
Dunghill
,
madam
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dung
-
hill
,
or
not
dung
-
hill
,
he
has
got
such
a
clear
counter
-
tenor
,
that
I
wish
I
had
such
another
at
Brambleton
-
hall
,
to
wake
the
maids
of
a
morning
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
where
I
could
find
one
of
his
brood
?
"
<EOS>
"
Probably
in
the
work
-
house
of
St.
Giles
's
parish
,
madam
;
but
I
protest
I
know
not
his
particular
mew
.
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
,
frying
with
vexation
,
cried
,
"
Good
God
,
sister
,
how
you
talk
!
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
twenty
times
,
that
this
gentleman
's
name
is
not
Gwynn
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
Hoity
toity
,
brother
mine
,
(
she
replied
)
<EOS>
no
offence
<EOS>
,
I
hope
 
Gwynn
is
an
honourable
name
,
of
true
old
British
extraction
  
<EOS>
I
thought
the
gentleman
had
been
come
of
Mrs
Helen
Gwynn
,
who
was
of
his
own
profession
;
and
if
so
be
that
were
the
case
,
he
might
be
of
king
Charles
's
breed
,
and
have
royal
blood
in
his
veins
 
"
"
No
,
madam
,
(
answered
Quin
,
with
great
solemnity
)
<EOS>
my
mother
was
not
a
whore
of
such
distinction
 
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
I
am
sometimes
tempted
to
believe
myself
of
royal
descent
;
for
my
inclinations
are
often
arbitrary
  
<EOS>
If
I
was
an
absolute
prince
,
at
this
instant
,
I
believe
I
should
send
for
the
head
of
your
cook
in
a
charger
 
<EOS>
She
has
committed
felony
on
the
person
of
that
John
Dory
;
which
is
mangled
in
a
cruel
manner
,
and
even
presented
without
sauce
 
O
tempora
!
<EOS>
O
mores
!
"
    
<EOS>
This
good
-
humoured
sally
turned
the
conversation
into
a
less
disagreeable
channel
 
<EOS>
But
,
lest
you
should
think
my
scribble
as
tedious
as
Mrs
Tabby
's
clack
,
I
shall
not
add
another
word
,
but
that
I
am
,
as
usual
,
    
yours

<EOS>
Bath
,
April
30
.
    
<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
I
RECEIVED
your
bill
upon
Wiltshire
,
which
was
punctually
honoured
;
but
as
I
do
n't
choose
to
keep
so
much
cash
by
me
,
in
a
common
lodging
-
house
,
I
have
deposited
250l
.
<EOS>
in
the
bank
of
Bath
,
and
shall
take
their
bills
for
it
in
London
,
when
I
leave
this
place
,
where
the
season
draws
to
an
end
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
now
being
a
foot
,
I
am
,
resolved
to
give
Liddy
a
glimpse
of
London
.
<EOS>
She
is
one
of
the
best
hearted
creatures
I
ever
knew
,
and
gains
upon
my
affection
every
day
 
<EOS>
As
for
Tabby
,
I
have
dropt
<EOS>
such
hints
to
the
Irish
baronet
,
concerning
her
fortune
,
<EOS>
as
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
will
cool
the
iardour
of
his
addresses
.
<EOS>
Then
her
pride
will
take
the
alarm
;
and
the
rancour
of
state
maidenhood
being
chased
,
we
shall
hear
nothing
but
slander
and
abuse
of
Sir
Ulick
Mackilligut
 
<EOS>
This
rupture
,
I
foresee
,
will
facilitate
our
departure
from
Bath
;
where
,
at
present
,
Tabby
seems
to
enjoy
herself
with
peculiar
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
detest
it
so
much
,
that
I
should
not
have
been
able
to
stay
so
long
in
the
place
if
I
had
not
discovered
some
old
friends
;
whose
conversation
alleviates
my
disgust
 
Going
to
the
coffee
-
house
one
forenoon
,
I
could
not
help
contemplating
the
company
,
with
equal
surprize
and
compassion
 
<EOS>
We
consisted
of
thirteen
individuals
;
<EOS>
seven
lamed
by
the
gout
,
rheumatism
,
or
palsy
;
three
maimed
by
accident
;
and
the
rest
either
deaf
or
blind
.
<EOS>
One
hobbled
,
another
hopped
,
a
third
dragged
his
legs
after
him
like
a
wounded
snake
,
a
fourth
straddled
betwixt
a
pair
of
long
crutches
,
like
the
mummy
of
a
felon
hanging
in
chains
;
a
fifth
was
bent
into
a
horizontal
position
,
like
a
mounted
telescope
,
shoved
in
by
a
couple
of
chairmen
;
and
a
sixth
was
the
bust
of
a
man
,
<EOS>
set
upright
in
a
wheel
machine
,
which
the
waiter
moved
from
place
to
place
.
    
<EOS>
Being
struck
with
some
of
their
faces
,
I
consulted
the
subscription
book
;
and
,
perceiving
the
names
of
several
old
friends
,
began
to
consider
the
groupe
with
more
attention
.
<EOS>
At
length
I
discovered
rear
admiral
Balderick
,
the
companion
of
my
youth
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
since
he
was
oppointed
lieutenant
of
the
Severn
.
<EOS>
He
was
metamorphosed
into
an
old
man
,
with
a
wooden
leg
and
a
weatherbeaten
face
which
appeared
the
more
ancient
from
his
grey
locks
,
that
were
truly
venerable
 
Sitting
down
at
the
table
,
where
he
was
reading
a
newspaper
,
I
gazed
at
him
for
some
minutes
,
with
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
regret
,
which
made
my
heart
gush
with
tenderness
;
then
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
"
Ah
,
Sam
,
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
forty
years
ago
I
little
thought
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
too
much
moved
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
old
friend
,
sure
enough
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
,
squeezing
my
hand
,
and
surveying
me
eagerly
thro
'
his
glasses
)
<EOS>
I
know
the
looming
of
the
vessel
,
though
she
has
been
hard
strained
since
we
parted
;
but
I
ca
n't
heave
up
the
name
 
<EOS>
"
The
moment
I
told
him
who
I
was
,
he
exclaimed
,
"
Ha
!
Matt
.
<EOS>
my
old
fellow
cruizer
,
still
afloat
!
"
<EOS>
And
,
starting
up
,
hugged
me
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
His
transport
,
however
,
beded
me
no
good
;
for
,
in
saluting
me
,
he
thrust
the
spring
of
his
spectacles
into
my
eye
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
set
his
wooden
stump
upon
my
gouty
toe
;
an
attack
that
made
me
shed
tears
in
sad
earnest
 
<EOS>
After
the
hurry
of
our
recognition
was
over
,
he
pointed
out
two
of
our
common
friends
in
the
room
:
<EOS>
the
bust
was
what
remained
of
colonel
Cockril
,
who
had
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
in
making
an
American
campain
;
and
the
telescope
proved
to
be
my
college
chum
,
sir
Reginald
Bently
;
who
,
with
his
new
title
,
and
unexpected
inheritance
,
commenced
fox
-
hunter
,
without
having
served
his
apprenticeship
to
the
mystery
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
following
the
hounds
through
a
river
,
was
seized
with
an
inflammation
in
his
bowels
,
which
has
contracted
him
into
his
present
attitude
.
    
<EOS>
Our
former
correspondence
was
forthwith
renewed
,
with
the
most
hearty
expressions
of
mutual
good
-
will
;
and
as
we
had
met
so
unexpectedly
,
we
agreed
to
dine
together
that
very
day
at
the
tavern
.
<EOS>
My
friend
Quin
,
being
luckily
unengaged
,
obliged
us
with
his
company
;
and
,
truly
,
this
was
the
most
happy
day
I
have
passed
these
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
,
Lewis
,
having
been
always
together
,
never
tasted
friendship
in
this
high
gout
,
contracted
from
long
absence
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
express
the
half
of
what
I
felt
at
this
casual
meeting
of
three
or
four
companions
,
who
had
been
so
long
separated
,
and
so
roughly
treated
by
the
storms
of
life
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
renovation
of
youth
;
a
kind
of
resuscitation
of
the
dead
,
that
realized
those
interesting
dreams
,
in
which
we
sometimes
retrieve
our
ancient
friends
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
my
enjoyment
was
not
the
less
pleasing
for
being
mixed
with
a
strain
of
melancholy
,
produced
by
the
remembrance
of
past
scene
,
that
conjured
up
the
ideas
of
some
endearing
connexions
,
which
the
hand
of
Death
has
actually
dissolved
.
    
<EOS>
The
spirits
and
good
humour
of
the
company
seemed
to
triumph
over
the
wreck
of
their
constitutions
.
<EOS>
They
had
even
philosophy
enough
to
joke
upon
their
own
calamities
;
such
is
the
power
of
friendship
,
the
sovereign
cordial
of
life
 
I
afterwards
found
,
however
,
that
they
were
not
without
their
moments
,
and
even
hours
of
disquiet
.
<EOS>
Each
of
them
apart
,
in
succeeding
conferences
,
expatiated
upon
his
own
particular
grievances
;
and
they
were
all
malecontents
at
bottom
 
Over
and
above
their
personal
disasters
,
they
thought
themselves
unfortunate
in
the
lottery
of

<EOS>
Balderick
complained
,
that
all
the
recompense
he
had
received
for
his
long
and
hard
service
,
was
the
half
-
pay
of
a
rear
admiral
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
was
mortified
to
see
himself
over
-
topped
by
upstart
generals
,
some
of
whom
he
had
once
commanded
;
and
,
being
a
man
of
a
liberal
turn
,
could
ill
put
up
with
a
moderate
annuity
,
for
which
he
had
sold
,
his
commission
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
baronet
,
having
run
himself
considerably
in
debt
,
on
a
contested
election
,
he
has
been
obliged
to
relinquish
his
seat
in
parliament
,
and
his
seat
in
the
country
at
the
same
time
,
and
put
his
estate
to
nurse
:
but
his
chagrin
,
which
is
the
effect
of
his
own
misconduct
,
does
not
affect
me
half
so
much
as
that
of
the
other
two
;
who
have
acted
honourable
and
distinguished
parts
on
the
great
theatre
,
and
are
now
reduced
to
lead
a
weary
life
in
this
stewpan
of
idleness
and
insignificance
.
<EOS>
They
have
long
left
off
using
the
waters
,
after
having
experienced
their
inefficacy
.
<EOS>
The
diversions
of
the
place
they
are
not
in
a
condition
to
enjoy
.
<EOS>
How
then
do
they
make
shift
to
pass
their
time
?
<EOS>
In
the
forenoon
,
they
crawl
out
to
the
Rooms
or
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
they
take
a
hand
at
whist
,
or
descant
upon
the
General
Advertiser
;
and
their
evenings
they
murder
in
private
parties
,
among
peevish
invalids
,
and
insipid
old
women
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
case
with
a
good
number
of
individuals
,
whom
nature
seems
to
have
intended
for
better
purposes
.
    
<EOS>
About
a
dozen
years
ago
,
many
decent
families
,
restricted
to
small
fortunes
,
besides
those
that
came
hither
on
the
score
of
health
,
were
tempted
to
settle
at
Bath
,
where
they
could
then
live
comfortably
,
and
even
make
a
genteel
appearance
,
at
a
small
expence
:
but
the
madness
of
the
times
has
made
the
place
too
hot
for
them
,
and
they
are
now
obliged
to
think
of
other
migrations
 
Some
have
already
fled
to
the
mountains
of
Wales
,
and
others
have
retired
to
Exeter
.
<EOS>
Thither
,
no
doubt
,
they
will
be
followed
by
the
flood
of
luxury
and
extravagance
,
which
will
drive
them
from
place
to
place
to
the
very
Land
's
End
;
and
there
,
I
suppose
,
they
will
be
obliged
to
ship
themselves
to
some
other
country
.
<EOS>
Bath
is
become
a
mere
sink
of
profligacy
and
extortion
.
<EOS>
Every
article
of
house
-
keeping
is
raised
to
an
enormous
price
;
a
circumstance
no
longer
to
be
wondered
at
,
when
we
know
that
every
petty
retainer
of
fortune
piques
himself
upon
keeping
a
table
,
and
thinks
'
tis
for
the
honour
of
his
character
to
wink
at
the
knavery
of
his
servants
,
who
are
in
a
confederacy
with
the
market
-
people
;
and
,
of
consequence
,
pay
whatever
they
demand
.
<EOS>
Here
is
now
a
mushroom
of
opulence
,
who
pays
a
cook
seventy
guineas
a
week
for
furnishing
him
with
one
meal
a
day
.
<EOS>
This
portentous
frenzy
is
become
so
contagious
,
that
the
very
rabble
and
refuse
of
mankind
are
infected
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
a
negro
-
driver
,
from
Jamaica
,
pay
over
-
night
to
the
master
of
one
of
the
Rooms
,
sixty
-
five
guineas
for
tea
and
coffee
to
the
company
,
and
leave
Bath
next
morning
,
in
such
obscurity
,
that
not
one
of
his
guests
had
the
slightest
idea
of
his
person
,
or
even
made
the
least
inquiry
about
his
name
.
<EOS>
Incidents
of
this
kind
are
frequent
;
and
every
day
teems
with
fresh
absurdities
,
which
are
too
gross
to
make
a
thinking
man
merry
.
  
<EOS>
But
I
feel
the
spleen
creeping
on
me
apace
;
and
therefore
will
indulge
you
with
a
cessation
,
that
you
may
have
no
unnecessary
cause
to
curse
your
correspondence
with
,

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LETTY
,
I
WROTE
you
at
great
length
by
the
post
,
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
last
month
,
to
which
I
refer
you
for
an
account
of
our
proceedings
at
Bath
;
and
I
expect
your
answer
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
But
,
having
this
opportunity
of
a
private
hand
,
I
send
you
two
dozen
of
Bath
-
rings
;
six
of
the
best
of
which
I
desire
you
will
keep
for
yourself
,
and
distribute
the
rest
among
the
young
ladies
,
our
common
friends
,
as
you
shall
think
proper
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
you
will
approve
of
the
mottoes
;
some
of
them
are
not
much
to
my
own
liking
;
but
I
was
obliged
to
take
such
as
I
could
find
ready
manufactured
  
<EOS>
I
am
vexed
,
that
neither
you
nor
I
have
received
any
further
information
of
a
certain
person
  
<EOS>
Sure
it
ca
n't
be
wilful
neglect
!
  
<EOS>
O
my
dear
Willis
!
<EOS>
I
begin
to
be
visited
by
strange
fancies
,
and
to
have
some
melancholy
doubts
;
which
,
however
,
it
would
be
ungenerous
to
harbour
without
further
inquiry
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
has
made
me
a
present
of
a
very
fine
set
of
garnets
,
talks
of
treating
us
with
a
jaunt
to
London
;
which
,
you
may
imagine
,
will
be
highly
agreeable
:
<EOS>
but
I
like
Bath
<EOS>
so
well
,
that
I
hope
he
wo
n't
think
of
leaving
it
till
the
season
is
quite
over
;
and
yet
,
betwixt
friends
,
something
has
happened
to
my
aunt
,
which
will
probably
shorten
our
stay
in
this
place
.
    
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
in
the
forenoon
,
she
went
by
herself
to
a
breakfasting
in
one
of
the
rooms
;
and
,
in
half
an
hour
,
returned
in
great
agitation
,
having
Chowder
along
with
her
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
I
believe
some
accident
must
have
happened
to
that
unlucky
animal
,
which
is
the
great
source
of
all
her
troubles
.
<EOS>
Dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
what
a
pity
it
is
,
that
a
woman
of
her
years
and
discretion
,
should
place
her
affection
upon
such
an
ugly
,
ill
-
conditioned
cur
,
that
snarls
and
snaps
at
every
body
.
<EOS>
I
asked
John
Thomas
,
the
footman
who
attended
her
,
what
was
the
matter
?
<EOS>
and
he
did
nothing
but
grin
!
<EOS>
A
famous
dog
-
doctor
was
sent
for
,
and
undertook
to
cure
the
patient
,
provided
he
might
carry
him
home
to
his
own
house
;
but
his
mistress
would
not
part
with
him
out
of
her
own
sight
 
<EOS>
She
ordered
the
cook
to
warm
cloths
,
which
she
applied
to
his
bowels
,
with
her
own
hand
.
<EOS>
She
gave
up
all
thoughts
of
going
to
the
ball
in
the
evening
;
and
when
Sir
Ulic
came
to
drink
tea
,
refused
to
be
seen
;
so
that
he
went
away
to
look
for
another
partner
.
<EOS>
My
brother
Jery
whistles
and
dances
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
sometimes
shrugs
up
his
shoulders
,
and
sometimes
bursts
out
a
-
laughing
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
sobs
and
scolds
by
turns
;
and
her
woman
,
Win
.
<EOS>
Jenkins
,
Hatch
and
wonders
with
a
foolish
face
of
curiosity
;
and
,
for
my
part
.
<EOS>
I
am
as
curious
as
she
,
but
ashamed
to
ask
questions
.
    
<EOS>
Perhaps
time
will
discover
the
mystery
;
for
if
it
was
any
thing
that
happened
in
the
Rooms
,
it
ca
n't
be
long
concealed
 
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
,
that
last
night
at
supper
,
miss
Bramble
spoke
very
disdainfully
of
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
,
and
asked
her
brother
if
he
intended
to
keep
us
sweltering
all
the
summer
at
Bath
?
"
<EOS>
No
,
sister
Tabitha
,
(
said
he
,
with
an
arch
smile
)
<EOS>
we
shall
retreat
before
the
Dog
days
begin
;
though
I
make
no
doubt
,
that
with
a
little
temperance
and
discretion
,
our
constitutions
might
be
kept
cool
enough
all
the
year
,
even
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
do
n't
know
the
meaning
of
this
insinuation
,
I
wo
n't
pretend
to
make
any
remarks
upon
it
at
present
:
hereafter
,
perhaps
,
I
may
be
able
to
explain
it
more
to
your
satsifaction
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
I
beg
you
will
be
punctual
in
your
correspondence
,
and
continue
to
love
your
ever
faithful
    
Lydia
Melford
.

Bath

To

Watkin
Phillips

Bart
.
<EOS>
of
Jesus
college
,
Oxon

<EOS>
SO
then
Mrs
Blackerby
's
affair
has
proved
a
false
alarm
,
and
I
have
saved
my
money
?
<EOS>
I
wish
,
however
,
her
declaration
had
not
been
so
premature
,
for
though
my
being
thought
capable
of
making
her
a
mother
,
might
have
given
me
some
credit
,
<EOS>
the
reputation
of
an
intrigue
with
such
a
cracked
pitcher
does
me
no
honour
at
all
 
<EOS>
In
my
last
I
told
you
I
had
hopes
of
seeing
Quin
,
in
his
hours
of
elevation
,
at
the
tavern
,
which
is
the
temple
of
mirth
and
good
-
fellowship
;
where
he
,
as
Priest
of
Comus
,
utters
the
inspirations
of
wit
and
humour
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
have
dined
with
his
club
at
the
Three
Tuns
,
and
had
the
honour
to
sit
him
out
.
<EOS>
At
half
an
hour
past
eight
in
the
evening
,
he
was
carried
home
with
six
good
bottles
of
claret
under
his
belt
;
and
it
being
then
Friday
,
he
gave
orders
that
he
should
not
be
disturbed
till
Sunday
at
noon
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
imagine
that
this
dose
had
any
other
effect
upon
his
conversation
,
but
that
of
making
it
more
extravagantly
entertaining
 
He
had
lost
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
indeed
,
several
hours
before
we
parted
,
but
he
retained
all
his
other
faculties
in
perfection
;
and
as
he
gave
vent
to
every
whimsical
idea
as
it
rose
,
I
was
really
astonished
at
the
brilliancy
of
his
thoughts
,
and
the
force
of
his
expression
.
<EOS>
Quin
is
a
real
voluptuary
in
the
articles
of
eating
and
drinking
;
and
so
confirmed
an
epicure
,
in
the
common
acceptation
of
the
term
,
that
he
can
not
put
up
with
ordinary
fare
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
point
of
such
importance
with
him
,
that
he
always
takes
upon
himself
the
charge
of
catering
;
and
a
man
admitted
to
his
mess
,
is
always
sure
of
eating
delicate
victuals
,
and
drinking
excellent
wine
 
<EOS>
He
owns
himself
addicted
to
the
delights
of
the
stomach
,
and
often
jokes
upon
his
own
sensuality
;
but
there
is
nothing
selfish
in
this
appetite
  
<EOS>
He
finds
that
good
chear
unites
good
company
;
exhilerates
the
spirits
,
opens
the
heart
,
<EOS>
banishes
all
restraint
from
conversation
,
and
promotes
the
happiest
purposes
of
social
life
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mr
James
Quin
is
not
a
subject
to
be
discussed
in
the
compass
of
one
letter
;
I
shall
therefore
,
at
present
,
leave
him
to
his
repose
,
and
call
another
of
a
very
different
complexion
.
    
<EOS>
You
desire
to
have
further
acquaintance
with
the
person
of
our
aunt
,
and
promise
yourself
much
entertainment
from
her
connexion
with
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
:
<EOS>
but
in
this
hope
you
are
baulked
already
;
that
connexion
is
dissolved
.
<EOS>
The
Irish
baronet
is
an
old
hound
,
that
finding
her
carrion
,
has
quitted
the
scent
 
I
have
already
told
you
,
that
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
is
a
maiden
of
forty
-
five
.
<EOS>
In
her
person
,
she
is
tall
,
raw
-
boned
,
aukward
,
flat
-
chested
,
and
stooping
;
her
complexion
is
sallow
and
freckled
;
her
eyes
are
not
grey
,
but
greenish
,
like
those
of
a
cat
,
and
generally
inflamed
;
her
hair
is
of
a
sandy
,
or
rather
dusty
hue
;
her
forehead
low
;
her
nose
long
,
sharp
,
and
,
towards
the
extremity
,
always
red
in
cool
weather
;
her
lips
skinny
,
her
mouth
extensive
,
her
teeth
straggling
and
loose
,
of
various
colours
and
conformation
;
and
her
long
neck
shrivelled
into
a
thousand
wrinkles
 
<EOS>
In
her
temper
,
she
is
proud
,
stiff
,
vain
,
imperious
,
prying
,
malicious
,
greedy
,
and
uncharitable
.
<EOS>
In
all
likelihood
,
her
natural
austerity
has
been
soured
by
disappointment
in
love
;
for
her
long
celibacy
is
by
no
means
owing
to
her
dislike
of
matrimony
:
on
the
contrary
,
she
has
left
no
stone
unturned
to
avoid
the
reproachful
epithet
of
old
maid
.
    
<EOS>
Before
I
was
born
,
she
had
gone
such
lengths
in
the
way
of
flirting
with
a
recruiting
officer
,
that
her
reputation
was
a
little
singed
.
<EOS>
She
afterwards
made
advances
to
the
curate
of
the
parish
,
who
dropped
some
distant
hints
about
the
next
presentation
to
the
living
,
which
was
in
her
brother
's
gift
;
but
finding
that
was
already
promised
to
another
,
he
flew
off
at
a
tangent
;
and
Mrs
Tabby
,
in
revenge
,
found
means
to
deprive
him
of
his
cure
.
<EOS>
Her
next
lover
was
lieutenant
of
a
man
of
war
,
a
relation
of
the
family
,
who
did
not
understand
the
refinements
of
the
passion
,
and
expressed
no
aversion
to
grapple
with
cousin
Tabby
in
the
way
of
marriage
;
but
before
matters
could
be
properly
adjusted
,
he
went
out
on
a
cruise
,
and
was
killed
in
an
engagement
with
a
French
frigate
.
<EOS>
Our
aunt
,
though
baffled
so
often
,
did
not
yet
despair
 
<EOS>
She
layed
all
her
-
snares
for
Dr
Lewis
,
who
is
the
fidus
Achates
of
my
uncle
.
<EOS>
She
even
fell
sick
upon
the
occasion
,
and
prevailed
with
Matt
to
interpose
in
her
behalf
with
his
friend
;
but
the
Doctor
being
a
shy
cock
,
would
not
be
caught
with
chaff
,
and
flatly
rejected
the
proposal
:
so
that
Mrs
Tabitha
was
content
to
exert
her
patience
once
more
,
after
having
endeavoured
in
vain
to
effect
a
rupture
betwixt
the
two
friends
;
and
now
she
thinks
proper
to
be
very
civil
to
Lewis
,
who
is
become
necessary
to
her
in
the
way
of
his
profession
.
    
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
are
not
the
only
efforts
she
has
made
towards
a
nearer
conjunction
with
our
sex
.
<EOS>
Her
fortune
was
originally
no
more
than
a
thousand
pounds
;
but
she
gained
an
accession
of
five
hundred
by
the
death
of
a
sister
,
and
the
lieutenant
left
her
three
hundred
in
his
will
.
<EOS>
These
sums
she
has
more
than
doubled
,
by
living
free
of
all
expence
,
in
her
brother
's
house
;
and
dealing
in
cheese
and
Welsh
flannel
,
the
produce
of
his
flocks
and
dairy
.
<EOS>
At
present
her
capital
is
increased
to
about
four
thousand
pounds
;
and
her
avarice
seems
to
grow
every
day
more
and
more
rapacious
;
but
even
this
is
not
so
intolerable
,
as
the
perverseness
of
her
nature
,
which
keeps
the
whole
family
in
disquiet
and
uproar
.
<EOS>
She
is
one
of
those
geniuses
who
find
some
diabolical
enjoyment
in
being
dreaded
and
detested
by
their
fellow
-
creatures
.
    
<EOS>
I
once
told
my
uncle
,
I
was
surprised
that
a
man
of
his
disposition
could
bear
such
a
domestic
plague
,
when
it
could
be
so
easily
removed
 
<EOS>
The
remark
made
him
sore
,
because
it
seemed
to
tax
him
with
want
of
resolution
 
Wrinkling
up
his
nose
,
and
drawing
down
his
eye
-
brows
,
"
A
young
fellow
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
when
he
first
thrusts
his
snout
into
the
world
,
is
apt
to
be
surprised
at
many
things
,
which
a
man
of
experience
knows
to
be
ordinary
and
unavoidable
 
This
precious
aunt
of
yours
is
become
insensibly
a
part
of
my
constitution
 
<EOS>
Damn
her
!
<EOS>
She
's
a
noli
me
tangere
in
my
flesh
,
which
I
can
not
bear
to
be
touched
or
tampered
with
.
<EOS>
"
I
made
no
reply
;
but
shifted
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
He
really
has
an
affection
for
this
original
,
which
maintains
its
ground
in
defiance
of
common
sense
,
and
in
despite
of
that
contempt
which
he
must
certainly
fell
for
her
character
and
understanding
,
Nay
,
I
am
convinced
,
that
she
has
likewise
a
most
virulent
attachment
to
his
person
;
though
her
love
never
shews
itself
but
in
the
shape
of
discontent
;
and
she
persists
in
tormenting
him
out
of
sheer
tenderness
 
<EOS>
The
only
object
within
doors
upon
which
she
bestows
any
marks
of
affection
,
in
the
usual
stile
,
is
her
dog
Chowder
;
a
filthy
our
from
Newfoundland
,
which
she
had
in
a
present
from
the
wife
of
a
skipper
in
Swansey
 
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
she
had
distinguished
this
beast
with
her
favour
on
account
of
his
ugliness
and
ill
-
nature
;
if
it
was
not
,
indeed
,
an
instinctive
sympathy
between
his
disposition
and
her
own
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
she
caresses
him
without
ceasing
;
and
even
harrasses
the
family
in
the
service
of
this
cursed
animal
,
which
,
indeed
,
has
proved
the
proximate
cause
of
<EOS>
her
breach
with
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
she
yesterday
wanted
to
steal
a
march
of
poor
Liddy
,
and
went
to
breakfast
in
the
Room
without
any
other
companion
than
her
dog
,
in
expectation
of
meeting
with
the
Baronet
,
who
had
agreed
to
dance
with
her
in
the
evening
 
Chowder
no
sooner
made
his
appearance
in
the
Room
than
the
master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
incensed
at
his
presumption
,
ran
up
to
drive
him
away
,
and
threatened
him
with
his
foot
;
but
the
other
seemed
to
despise
his
authority
,
and
displaying
a
formidable
case
of
long
,
white
,
sharp
teeth
,
kept
the
puny
monarch
at
bay
 
while
he
stood
under
some
trepidation
,
fronting
his
antagonist
,
and
bawling
to
the
waiter
,
Sir
Ulic
Mackilligut
came
to
his
assistance
;
and
seeming
ignorant
of
the
connexion
between
this
intruder
and
his
mistress
gave
the
former
such
a
kick
in
the
jaws
,
as
sent
him
howling
to
the
door
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
incensed
at
this
outrage
,
ran
after
him
,
squalling
in
a
tone
equally
disagreeable
;
while
the
Baronet
followed
her
on
one
side
,
making
apologies
for
his
mistake
;
and
Derrick
on
the
other
,
making
remonstrances
upon
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
Far
from
being
satisfied
with
the
Knight
's
excuses
,
she
said
she
was
sure
he
was
no
gentleman
;
and
when
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
offered
to
hand
her
into
the
chair
,
she
rapped
him
over
the
knuckles
with
her
fan
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
footman
being
still
at
the
door
,
she
and
Chowder
got
into
the
same
vehicle
,
and
were
carried
off
amidst
the
jokes
of
the
chairmen
and
other
populace
 
<EOS>
I
had
been
riding
out
on
Clerkendown
,
and
happened
to
enter
just
as
the
fracas
was
over
 
<EOS>
The
Baronet
,
coming
up
to
me
with
an
affected
air
of
chagrin
recounted
the
adventure
;
at
which
I
laughed
heartily
,
and
then
his
countenance
cleared
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
soul
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
when
I
saw
a
sort
of
a
wild
baist
,
snarling
with
open
mouth
at
the
Master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
like
the
red
cow
going
to
devour
Tom
Thumb
,
I
could
do
no
less
than
go
to
the
assistance
of
the
little
man
;
but
I
never
dreamt
the
baist
<EOS>
was
one
of
Mrs
Bramble
's
attendants
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
if
I
had
,
he
might
have
made
his
breakfast
upon
Derrick
and
welcome
 
<EOS>
But
,
you
know
,
my
dear
friend
,
how
natural
it
is
for
us
Irishmen
to
blunder
,
and
to
take
the
wrong
sow
by
the
ear
 
<EOS>
However
I
will
confess
judgment
,
and
cry
her
mercy
;
and
'
tis
to
be
hoped
,
a
penitent
sinner
may
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
,
that
as
the
offence
was
not
involuntary
of
his
side
,
it
was
to
be
hoped
he
would
not
find
her
implacable
.
    
<EOS>
But
in
truth
,
all
this
concern
was
dissembled
.
<EOS>
In
his
approaches
of
gallantry
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
he
had
been
misled
by
a
mistake
of
at
least
six
thousand
pounds
,
in
the
calculation
of
her
fortune
;
and
in
this
particular
he
was
just
undeceived
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
incurring
her
displeasure
decently
,
in
such
a
manner
as
would
certainly
annihilate
the
correspondence
;
and
he
could
not
have
taken
a
more
effectual
method
,
than
that
of
beating
her
dog
.
<EOS>
When
he
presented
himself
at
our
door
,
to
pay
his
respects
to
the
offended
fair
,
he
was
refused
admittance
;
and
given
to
understand
,
that
he
should
never
find
her
at
home
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
so
inaccessible
to
Derrick
,
who
came
to
demand
satisfaction
for
the
insult
she
had
offered
to
him
,
even
in
the
verge
of
his
own
court
.
<EOS>
She
knew
it
was
convenient
to
be
well
with
the
master
of
the
Ceremonies
,
while
she
continued
to
frequent
the
Rooms
;
and
,
having
heard
he
was
a
poet
,
began
to
be
afraid
of
making
her
appearance
in
a
ballad
or
lampoon
.
  
<EOS>
She
therefore
made
excuses
for
what
she
had
done
,
imputing
it
to
the
flutter
of
her
spirits
;
and
subscribed
handsomely
for
his
poems
:
so
that
he
was
perfectly
appeased
,
and
overwhelmed
her
with
a
profusion
of
compliment
.
<EOS>
He
even
solicited
a
reconciliation
with
Chowder
;
which
,
however
,
the
latter
declined
;
and
he
declared
,
that
if
he
could
find
a
precedent
in
the
annals
of
the
Bath
,
which
he
would
carefully
examine
for
that
purpose
,
her
favourite
should
be
admitted
to
the
next
public
breakfasting
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
believe
she
will
not
expose
herself
or
him
to
the
risque
of
a
second
disgrace
 
Who
will
supply
the
place
of
Mackilligut
in
her
affections
,
I
can
not
foresee
;
but
nothing
in
the
shape
of
man
can
come
amiss
.
<EOS>
Though
she
is
a
violent
church
-
woman
,
of
the
most
intolerant
zeal
,
I
believe
in
my
conscience
she
would
have
no
objection
,
at
present
,
to
treat
on
the
score
of
matrimony
with
an
Anabaptist
,
Quaker
,
or
Jew
;
and
even
ratify
the
treaty
,
at
the
expence
of
her
own
conversion
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
,
I
think
too
hardly
of
this
kinswoman
;
who
,
I
must
own
,
is
very
little
beholden
to
the
good
opinion
of
    
Yours
,
J
Melford

<EOS>
Bath
,
May
6
.
    
<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
YOU
ask
me
,
why
I
do
n't
take
the
air
a
-
horseback
,
during
this
fine
weather
?
  
<EOS>
In
which
of
the
avenues
of
this
paradise
would
you
have
me
take
that
exercise
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
commit
myself
to
the
highroads
of
London
or
Bristol
,
to
be
stifled
with
dust
,
or
pressed
to
death
in
the
midst
of
post
-
chaises
,
flying
machines
,
waggons
,
and
coal
horses
;
besides
the
troops
of
fine
gentlemen
that
take
to
the
highway
to
shew
their
horsemanship
!
<EOS>
and
the
coaches
of
fine
ladies
,
who
go
thither
to
shew
their
equipages
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
attempt
the
Downs
,
and
fatigue
myself
to
death
in
climbing
up
an
eternal
ascent
,
without
any
hopes
of
reaching
the
summit
?
<EOS>
Know
<EOS>
then
,
I
have
made
divers
desperate
leaps
at
those
upper
regions
;
but
always
fell
backward
into
this
vapour
-
pit
,
exhausted
and
dispirited
by
those
ineffectual
efforts
;
and
here
we
poor
valetudinatians
pant
and
struggle
,
like
so
many
Chinese
gudgeons
,
gasping
in
the
bottom
of
a
punch
bowl
.
<EOS>
By
Heaven
it
is
a
kind
of
inchantment
!
<EOS>
If
I
do
not
speedily
break
the
spell
,
and
escape
,
I
may
chance
to
give
up
the
ghost
in
this
nauseous
stew
of
corruption
 
<EOS>
It
was
but
two
nights
ago
,
that
I
had
like
to
have
made
my
public
exit
,
at
a
minute
's
warning
.
<EOS>
One
of
my
greatest
weaknesses
is
that
of
suffering
myself
to
be
over
-
ruled
by
the
opinion
of
people
,
whose
judgment
I
despise
 
<EOS>
I
own
,
with
shame
and
confusion
of
face
,
that
importunity
of
any
kind
I
can
not
resist
.
<EOS>
This
want
of
courage
and
constancy
is
an
original
flaw
in
my
nature
,
which
you
must
have
often
observed
with
compassion
,
if
not
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
some
of
our
boasted
virtues
may
be
traced
up
to
this
defect
.
     
<EOS>
Without
further
preamble
,
I
was
persuaded
to
go
to
a
ball
,
on
purpose
to
see
Liddy
dance
a
minuet
with
a
young
petulant
jackanapes
,
the
only
son
of
a
wealthy
undertaker
from
London
,
whose
mother
lodges
in
our
neighbourhood
,
and
has
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
Tabby
.
<EOS>
I
sat
a
couple
of
long
hours
,
half
stifled
,
in
the
midst
of
a
noysome
crowd
;
and
could
not
help
wondering
,
that
so
many
hundred
of
those
that
rank
as
rational
creatures
,
could
find
entertainment
in
seeing
a
succession
of
insipid
animals
,
describing
the
same
dull
figure
for
a
whole
evening
,
on
an
area
,
not
much
bigger
than
a
taylor
's
shop
-
board
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
any
beauty
,
grace
,
activity
,
magnificent
dress
,
or
variety
of
any
kind
,
howsoever
absurd
,
to
engage
the
attention
,
and
amuse
the
fancy
,
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
;
but
there
was
no
such
object
:
it
was
a
tiresome
repetition
of
the
same
languid
,
frivolous
scene
,
performed
by
actors
that
seemed
to
sleep
in
all
their
motions
 
<EOS>
The
continual
swimming
of
those
phantoms
before
my
eyes
,
gave
me
a
swimming
of
the
head
;
which
was
also
affected
by
the
fouled
air
,
circulating
through
such
a
number
of
rotten
human
bellows
 
<EOS>
I
therefore
retreated
towards
the
door
,
and
stood
in
the
passage
to
the
next
room
,
talking
to
my
friend
Quin
;
when
an
end
being
put
to
the
minuets
,
the
benches
were
removed
to
make
way
for
the
country
-
dances
;
and
the
multitude
rising
at
once
,
the
whole
atmosphere
was
put
in
commotion
.
<EOS>
Then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
came
rushing
upon
me
,
an
Egyptian
gale
,
so
impregnated
with
pestilential
vapours
,
that
my
nerves
were
overpowered
,
and
I
dropt
sensess
upon
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
easily
conceive
what
a
clamour
and
confusion
this
accident
must
have
produced
,
in
such
an
assembly
 
<EOS>
I
soon
recovered
,
however
,
and
found
myself
in
an
easy
chair
,
supported
by
my
own
people
 
Sister
Tabby
,
in
her
great
tenderness
,
had
put
me
to
the
torture
,
squeezing
my
head
under
her
arm
,
and
stuffing
my
nose
with
spirit
of
hartshorn
,
till
the
whole
inside
was
excoriated
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
got
home
,
than
I
sent
for
doctor
Ch
#
#
#
#
,
who
assured
me
<EOS>
,
I
needed
not
be
alarmed
,
for
my
swooning
was
entirely
occasioned
by
an
accidental
impression
of
fetid
effluvia
upon
nerves
of
uncommon
sensibility
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
other
people
's
nerves
are
constructed
;
but
one
would
imagine
they
must
be
made
of
very
coarse
materials
to
stand
the
shock
of
such
a
horrid
assault
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
compound
of
villanous
smells
,
in
which
the
most
violent
stinks
,
and
the
most
powerful
perfumes
,
contended
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
Imagine
to
yourself
a
high
exalted
essence
of
mingled
odours
,
arising
from
putrid
gums
,
impost
-
humated
lungs
,
sour
flatulencies
,
rank
arm
-
pits
,
sweating
feet
,
running
sores
and
issues
;
plasters
,
ointments
,
and
embrocations
,
hungary
-
water
,
spirit
of
lavander
,
assasoetida
drops
,
musk
,
hartshorn
,
and
sal
volatile
;
besides
a
thousand
frowzy
steams
,
which
I
could
not
analyse
.
<EOS>
Such
,
O
Dick
!
<EOS>
is
the
fragrant
<EOS>
aether
we
breathe
in
the
polite
assemblies
of
Bath
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
atmosphere
I
have
exchanged
for
the
pure
,
elastic
,
animating
air
of
the
Welsh
mountains
 
<EOS>
O
Rus
,
quando
te
aspiciam
!
  
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
the
devil
possessed
me
     
<EOS>
But
few
words
are
best
:
I
have
taken
my
resolution
  
<EOS>
You
may
well
suppose
I
do
n't
intend
to
entertain
the
company
with
a
second
exhibition
 
I
have
promised
,
in
an
evil
hour
,
to
proceed
to
London
,
and
that
promise
shall
be
performed
;
but
my
stay
in
the
metropolis
shall
be
brief
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
,
projected
an
expedition
to
the
North
,
which
,
I
hope
,
will
afford
some
agreable
pastime
.
<EOS>
I
have
never
travelled
farther
that
way
than
Scarborough
;
and
,
I
think
it
is
a
reproach
upon
me
,
as
a
British
freeholder
,
to
have
lived
so
long
without
making
an
excursion
to
the
other

of
the
Tweed

Besides
,
I
have
some
relations
settled
in
Yorkshire

whom
it

not
be
improper
to
introduce
my

his

At

I
have
nothing
to
add

that
Tabby

happily
disentangled

that
I

not
fail
to
make
you
acquainted

from
time

with
the
sequel
of
our

a

perhaps

dispense

<EOS>
DEAR
PHILIPS
,
A
FEW
days
ago
we
were
terribly
alarmed
by
my
uncle
's
fainting
at
the
ball
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
ever
since
cursing
his
own
folly
,
for
going
thither
at
the
request
of
an
impertinent
woman
.
<EOS>
He
declares
,
he
will
sooner
visit
a
house
infected
with
the
plague
,
than
trust
himself
in
such
a
nauseous
spital
for
the
future
,
for
he
swears
the
accident
was
occasioned
by
the
stench
of
the
crowd
;
and
that
he
would
never
desire
a
stronger
proof
of
our
being
made
of
very
gross
materials
,
than
our
having
withstood
the
annoyance
,
by
which
he
was
so
much
discomposed
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
am
very
thankful
for
the
coarseness
of
my
organs
,
being
in
no
danger
of
ever
falling
a
sacrifice
to
the
delicacy
of
my
nose
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
is
extravagantly
delicate
in
all
his
sensations
,
both
of
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
I
was
infomed
by
Dr
Lewis
,
that
he
once
fought
a
duel
with
an
officer
of
the
horse
guards
,
for
turning
aside
to
the
Park
wall
,
on
a
necessary
occasion
,
when
he
was
passing
with
a
lady
under
his
protection
.
<EOS>
His
blood
rises
at
every
instance
of
insolence
and
cruelty
,
even
where
he
himself
is
no
way
concerned
;
and
ingratitude
makes
his
teeth
chatter
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
recital
of
a
generous
,
humane
,
or
grateful
action
,
never
fails
to
draw
from
him
tears
of
approbation
,
which
he
is
often
greatly
distressed
o
conceal
.
    
<EOS>
Yesterday
one
Paunceford
gave
tea
,
on
particular
invitation
 
<EOS>
This
man
,
after
having
been
long
buffeted
by
adversity
,
went
abroad
;
and
Fortune
,
resolved
to
make
him
amends
for
her
former
coyness
,
set
him
all
at
once
up
to
the
very
ears
in
affluence
.
<EOS>
He
has
now
emerged
from
obscurity
,
and
blazes
out
in
all
the
tinsel
of
the
times
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
find
that
he
is
charged
with
any
practices
that
the
law
deems
dishonest
,
or
that
his
wealth
has
made
him
arrogant
and
inaccessible
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
takes
great
pains
to
appear
affable
and
gracious
.
<EOS>
But
they
say
,
he
is
remarkable
for
shrinking
from
his
former
friendships
,
which
were
generally
too
plain
and
homespun
to
appear
amidst
his
present
brilliant
connexions
;
and
that
he
seems
uneasy
at
the
sight
of
some
old
benefactors
,
whom
a
man
of
honour
would
take
pleasure
to
acknowledge
 
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
he
had
so
effectually
engaged
the
company
at
Bath
,
that
when
I
went
with
my
uncle
to
the
coffee
-
house
in
the
evening
,
there
was
not
a
soul
in
the
room
but
one
person
,
seemingly
in
years
,
who
sat
by
the
fire
,
reading
one
of
the
papers
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
taking
his
station
close
by
him
,
"
There
is
such
a
crowd
and
confusion
of
chairs
in
the
passage
to
Simpson
's
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
that
we
could
hardly
get
along
 
<EOS>
I
wish
those
minions
of
fortune
would
fall
upon
more
laudable
ways
of
spending
their
money
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
,
Sir
,
you
like
this
kind
of
entertainment
as
little
as
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
I
have
any
great
relish
for
such
entertainments
,
"
answered
the
other
,
without
taking
his
eyes
off
the
paper
  
"
Mr
Serle
,
(
resumed
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
interrupting
you
;
but
I
ca
n't
resist
the
curiosity
I
have
to
know
if
you
received
a
card
on
this
occasion
?
"
    
<EOS>
The
man
seemed
surprised
at
this
address
,
and
made
some
pause
as
doubtful
what
answer
he
should
make
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
my
curiosity
is
impertinent
,
added
my
uncle
,
but
I
have
a
particular
reason
for
asking
the
favour
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
,
(
replied
Mr
Serle
)
<EOS>
I
shall
gratify
you
without
hesitation
,
by
owning
,
that
I
have
had
no
card
.
<EOS>
But
,
give
me
leave
,
Sir
,
to
ask
in
my
turn
,
what
reason
you
think
I
have
to
expect
such
an
invitation
from
the
gentleman
who
gives
tea
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
have
my
own
reasons
;
(
cried
Mr
Bramble
,
with
some
emotion
)
and
am
convinced
more
than
ever
,
that
this
Paunceford
is
a
contemptible
fellow
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
said
the
other
,
laying
down
the
paper
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
the
honour
to
know
you
,
but
your
discourse
is
a
little
mysterious
,
and
seems
to
require
some
explanation
.
<EOS>
The
person
you
are
pleased
to
treat
so
cavalierly
,
is
a
gentleman
of
some
consequence
in
the
community
;
and
,
for
aught
you
know
,
I
may
also
have
my
particular
reasons
for
defending
his
character
 
"
"
If
I
was
not
convinced
of
the
contrary
,
(
observed
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
gone
so
far
 
"
"
Let
me
tell
you
,
Sir
,
<EOS>
(
said
the
stranger
,
raising
his
voice
)
<EOS>
you
have
gone
too
far
,
in
hazarding
such
reflections
 
"
    
<EOS>
Here
he
was
interrupted
by
my
uncle
;
who
asked
peevishly
,
if
he
was
Don
Quixote
enough
,
at
this
time
of
day
,
to
throw
down
his
gauntler
as
champion
for
a
man
who
had
treated
him
with
such
ungrateful
neglect
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
(
added
he
)
<EOS>
I
shall
never
quarrel
with
you
again
upon
this
subject
;
and
what
I
have
said
now
,
has
been
suggested
as
much
by
my
regard
for
you
,
as
by
my
contempt
of
him
 
"
Mr
Serle
,
then
pulling
off
his
spectacles
,
eyed
my
uncle
very
earnestly
,
saying
,
in
a
mitigated
tone
,
"
Surely
I
am
much
obliged
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
Mr
Bramble
!
<EOS>
I
now
recollect
your
features
,
though
I
have
not
seen
you
these
many
years
.
"
<EOS>
"
We
might
have
been
less
strangers
to
one
another
,
(
answered
the
"
squire
)
if
our
corespondence
had
not
been
interrupted
,
in
consequence
of
a
misunderstanding
,
occasioned
by
this
very
 
,
but
no
matter
  
Mr
Serle
,
I
esteem
your
character
;
and
my
friendship
,
such
as
it
is
,
you
may
freely
command
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
offer
is
too
agreeable
to
be
declined
(
said
he
)
;
I
embrace
it
very
cordially
;
and
,
as
the
first
fruits
of
it
,
request
that
you
will
change
this
subject
,
which
,
with
me
,
is
a
matter
of
peculiar
delicacy
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
owned
he
was
in
the
right
,
and
the
discourse
took
a
more
general
turn
.
<EOS>
Mr
Serle
passed
the
evening
with
us
at
our
lodgings
;
and
appeared
to
be
intelligent
,
and
even
entertaining
;
but
his
disposition
was
rather
of
a
melancholy
hue
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
says
he
is
a
man
of
uncommon
parts
,
and
unquestioned
probity
:
that
his
fortune
,
which
was
originally
small
,
has
been
greatly
hurt
by
a
romantic
spirit
of
generosity
,
which
he
has
often
displayed
,
even
at
the
expence
of
his
discretion
,
in
favour
of
worthless
individuals
 
That
he
had
rescued
Paunceford
from
the
lowest
distress
,
when
he
was
bankrupt
,
both
in
means
and
reputation
  
That
he
had
espoused
his
interests
with
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
broke
,
with
several
friends
and
even
drawn
his
sword
against
my
uncle
,
who
had
particular
reasons
for
questioning
the
moral
character
of
the
said
Paunceford
:
that
,
without
Serle
's
countenance
and
assistance
,
the
other
never
could
have
embraced
the
opportunity
,
which
has
raised
him
to
this
pinnacle
of
wealth
:
that
Paunceford
,
in
the
first
transports
of
his
success
,
had
written
,
from
abroad
,
letters
to
different
correspondents
,
owning
his
obligations
to
Mr
Serle
,
in
the
warmest
terms
of
acknowledgment
,
and
declaring
he
considered
himself
only
as
a
factor
for
the
occasions
of
his
best
friend
:
that
,
without
doubt
,
he
had
made
declarations
of
the
same
nature
to
his
benefactor
himself
,
though
this
last
was
always
silent
and
reserved
on
the
subject
;
but
for
some
years
,
those
tropes
and
figures
of
rhetoric
had
been
disused
:
that
upon
his
return
to
England
,
he
had
been
lavish
in
his
caresses
to
Mr
Serle
,
invited
him
to
his
house
,
and
pressed
him
to
make
it
his
own
:
that
he
had
overwhelmed
him
with
general
professions
,
and
affected
to
express
the
warmest
regard
for
him
,
in
company
of
their
common
acquaintance
;
so
that
every
body
believed
his
gratitude
was
as
liberal
as
his
fortune
;
and
some
went
so
far
as
to
congratulate
Mr
Serle
on
both
.
    
<EOS>
All
this
time
Paunceford
carefully
and
artfully
avoided
particular
discussions
with
his
old
patron
,
who
had
too
much
spirit
to
drop
the
most
distant
hint
of
balancing
the
account
of
obligation
:
that
,
nevertheless
,
a
man
of
his
feelings
could
not
but
resent
this
shocking
return
for
all
his
kindness
;
and
,
therefore
,
he
withdrew
himself
from
the
connexion
,
without
coming
to
the
least
explanation
,
or
speaking
a
syllable
on
the
subject
to
any
living
soul
;
so
that
now
their
correspondence
is
reduced
to
a
slight
salute
with
the
hat
,
when
they
chance
to
meet
in
any
public
place
;
an
accident
that
rarely
happens
,
for
their
walks
lie
different
ways
.
<EOS>
Mr
Paunceford
lives
in
a
palace
,
feeds
upon
dainties
,
is
arrayed
in
sumptuous
apparel
,
appears
in
all
the
pomp
of

,
and
passes

<EOS>
Paunceford
once
resided
in
a
garret
;
where
he
subsisted
upon
sheep
's
trotters
and
cow
-
heel
,
from
which
commons
he
was
translated
to
the
table
of
Serle
,
that
even
abounded
with
good
cheer
;
until
want
of
oeconomy
and
retention
,
reduced
him
to
a
slender
annuity
in
his
decline
of
years
,
that
scarce
affords
the
bare
necessaries
of
life
 
<EOS>
Paunceford
,
however
,
does
him
the
honour
to
speak
of
him
still
,
with
uncommon
regard
;
and
to
declare
what
pleasure
it
would
give
him
to
contribute
in
any
shape
to
his
convenience
:
"
But
you
know
,
(
he
never
fails
to
add
)
<EOS>
he
's
a
shy
kind
of
a
man
 
<EOS>
And
then
such
a
perfect
phillosopher

that
he
looks
upon
all
superfluities

the
most

contempt

I

not

any

They
wo
n't
suffer
the

to
stay
any

;
because
they
have
been
already
above
three

in
the

and
they
look
for
a
couple
of
ginneys
a

piece
at
our
going
away
;
and
this
is
a
perquisite
they
expect
every

being
as
how
no
family
has
a
right
to
stay
longer
than
four
weeks

so
the

she
will
pin

making

in
the
way
of

and
I

I
missed
three
quarters

my

which
was

I
left

,
if
you
sleep
with
your
mouth
open
 
<EOS>
And
so
says
I
to
myself
,
them
things
could
not
go
without
hands
;
and
so
I
'll
watch
their
waters
:
<EOS>
And
so
I
did
with
a
vitness
;
for
then
it
was
I
found
Bett
consarned
with
O
Frizzle
.
<EOS>
And
as
the
cuck
had
thrown
her
slush
at
me
,
because
I
had
taken
part
with
Chowder
,
when
he
sit
with
the
turnspit
,
I
resolved
to
make
a
clear
kitchen
and
throw
some
of
her
fat
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
I
ketched
the
chare
-
woman
going
out
with
her
load
in
the
morning
,
before
she
thought
I
was
up
,
and
brought
her
to
mistress
with
her
whole
cargo
 
Marry
,
<EOS>
what
do'st
think
she
had
got
in
the
name
of
God
?
<EOS>
Her
buckets
were
foaming
full
of
our
best
bear
,
and
her
lap
was
stuffed
with
a
cold
tongue
,
part
of
a
buttock
of
beef
,
half
a
turkey
,
and
a
swinging
lump
of
butter
,
and
the
matter
of
ten
mould
kandles
,
that
had
scarce
ever
been
lit
.
<EOS>
The
cuck
brazened
it
out
,
and
said
it
was
her
rite
to
rummage
the
pantry
;
and
she
was
ready
for
to
go
before
the
mare
:
that
he
had
been
her
potticary
many
years
,
and
would
never
think
of
hurting
a
poor
sarvant
,
for
giving
away
the
scraps
of
the
kitchen
 
<EOS>
I
went
another
way
to
work
with
madam
Betty
,
because
she
had
been
saucy
,
and
called
me
skandelous
names
;
and
said
O
Frizzle
could
n't
abide
me
,
and
twenty
other
odorous
falsehoods
.
<EOS>
I
got
a
varent
from
the
mare
,
and
her
box
being
sarched
by
the
constable
,
my
things
came
out
sure
enuff
;
besides
a
full
pound
of
vax
candles
,
and
a
nite
-
cap
of
mistress
,
that
I
could
sware
to
on
my
cruperal
oaf
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
the
madam
Mopstick
came
upon
her
merry
bones
,
and
as
the
"
squire
would
n't
hare
of
a
persecution
,
she
escaped
a
shewering
:
but
the
longest
day
she
has
to
live
,
she
'll
remember
your
    
humble
sarvant
,

If
the

pray
send

YOU
are
in
the
right
,
<EOS>
dear
Phillips
;
I
do
n't
expect
regular
answers
to
every
letter
 
<EOS>
I
know
a
college
-
life
is
too
circumscribed
to
afford
materials
for
such
quick
returns
of
communication
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
am
continually
shifting
the
scene
,
and
surrounded
with
new
objects
,
some
of
which
are
striking
enough
.
<EOS>
I
shall
therefore
conclude
my
journal
for
your
amusement
;
and
though
,
in
all
appearance
,
it
will
not
treat
of
very
important
or
interesting
particulars
,
it
may
prove
,
perhaps
,
not
altogether
uninstructive
and
unentertaining
.
    
<EOS>
The
musick
,
and
entertainment
of
Bath
are
over
for
this
season
;
and
all
our
gay
birds
of
passage
have
taken
their
flight
to
Bristol
-
well
,
Tunbridge
,
Brighthelmstone
,
Scarborough
,
Horrowgate
,
&
c
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
is
seen
in
this
place
,
but
a
few
broken
-
winded
parsons
,
waddling
like
so
many
crows
long
the
North
Parade
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
a
great
shew
of
the
clergy
at
Bath
;
none
of
your
thin
,
puny
,
yellow
hectic
figures
,
exhausted
with
abstinence
and
hard
study
,
labouring
under
the
morbi
cruditorum
;
but
great
over
-
grown
dignitaries
and
rectors
,
with
rubicund
noses
and
gouty
ancles
,
or
broad
bloated
faces
,
dragging
along
great
swag
bellies
;
the
emblems
of
sloth
and
indigestion
     
Now
we
are
upon
the
subject
of
parsons
,
I
must
tell
you
a
ludicrous
adventure
,
which
was
atchieved
the
other
day
by
Tom
Fastgate
,
whom
you
may
remember
on
the
foundation
of
Queen
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
very
assiduous
to
pin
himself
upon
George
Prankley
,
who
was
a
gentleman
-
commoner
of
Christ
-
church
,
knowing
the
said
<EOS>
Prankley
was
heir
to
a
considerable
estate
,
and
would
have
the
advowson
of
a
good
living
,
the
incumbent
of
which
was
very
old
and
infirm
.
<EOS>
He
studied
his
passions
and
flattered
them
so
effectually
,
as
to
become
his
companion
and
counsellor
;
and
at
last
,
obtained
of
him
a
promise
of
the
presentation
,
when
the
living
should
fall
.
<EOS>
Prankley
,
on
his
uncle
's
death
,
quitted
Oxford
,
and
made
his
first
appearance
in
the
fashionable
world
at
London
;
from
whence
he
came
lately
to
Bath
,
where
he
has
been
exhibiting
himself
among
the
bucks
and
gamesters
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Eastgate
followed
him
hither
;
but
he
should
not
have
quitted
him
for
a
moment
,
at
his
first
emerging
into
life
.
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
known
he
was
a
fantastic
,
foolish
,
fickle
fellow
,
who
would
forget
his
college
-
attachments
the
moment
,
they
ceased
appealing
to
his
senses
.
<EOS>
Tom
met
with
a
cold
reception
from
his
old
friend
;
and
was
,
moreover
,
informed
,
that
he
had
promised
the
living
to
another
man
,
who
had
a
vote
in
the
county
,
where
be
proposed
to
offer
himself
a
candidate
at
the
next
general
election
.
<EOS>
He
now
remembered
nothing
of
Eastgate
,
but
the
freedoms
he
had
used
to
take
with
him
,
while
Tom
had
quietly
stood
his
butt
,
with
an
eye
to
the
benefice
;
and
those
freedoms
he
began
to
repeat
in
common
place
sarcasms
on
his
person
and
his
cloth
,
which
he
uttered
in
the
public
coffee
-
house
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
egregiously
mistaken
in
giving
his
own
wit
credit
for
that
tameness
of
Eastgate
,
which
had
been
entirely
owing
to
prudential
considerations
.
<EOS>
These
being
now
removed
,
he
retorted
his
repartee
with
interest
,
and
found
no
great
difficulty
in
turning
the
laugh
upon
the
aggressor
;
who
,
losing
his
temper
,
called
him
names
,
and
asked
,
If
he
knew
whom
he
talked
to
?
<EOS>
After
much
altercation
,
Prankley
shaking
his
cane
,
bid
him
hold
his
tongue
,
otherwise
he
would
dust
his
cassock
for
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
pretensions
to
such
a
valet
(
said
Tom
)
;
but
if
you
should
do
me
that
office
,
and
overheat
yourself
,
I
have
here
a
good
oaken
towel
at
your
service
.
"
    
<EOS>
Prankley
was
equally
incensed
and
confounded
at
this
reply
.
<EOS>
After
moment
's
pause
,
he
took
him
aside
towards
the
window
;
and
,
pointing
to
the
clump
of
firs
on
Clerken
-
down
,
asked
in
a
whisper
,
if
he
had
spirit
enough
to
meet
him
there
,
with
a
case
of
pistols
,
at
six
o'clock
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
Eastgate
answered
in
the
affirmative
;
and
,
with
a
steady
countenance
,
assured
him
,
he
would
not
fail
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
at
the
hour
he
mentioned
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
retired
;
and
the
challenger
stayed
some
time
in
manifest
agitation
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
Eastgate
,
who
knew
his
man
,
and
had
taken
his
resolution
,
went
to
Prankley
's
lodgings
,
and
roused
him
by
five
o'clock
     
<EOS>
The
"
squire
,
in
all
probability
,
cursed
his
punctuality
in
his
heart
,
but
he
affected
to
talk
big
;
and
having
prepared
his
artillery
over
-
night
,
they
crossed
the
water
at
the
end
of
the
South
Parade
.
<EOS>
In
their
progress
up
the
hill
,
Prankley
often
eyed
the
parson
,
in
hopes
of
perceiving
some
reluctance
in
his
countenance
;
but
as
no
such
marks
appeared
he
attempted
to
intimidate
him
by
word
of
mouth
,
"
If
these
flints
do
their
office
(
said
he
)
,
I
'll
do
thy
business
in
a
few
minutes
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
desire
you
will
do
your
best
(
replied
the
other
)
;
for
my
part
,
I
come
not
here
to
trifle
.
<EOS>
Our
lives
are
in
the
hands
of
God
;
and
one
of
us
already
totters
on
the
brink
of
eternity
 
<EOS>
"
This
remark
seemed
to
make
some
impression
upon
the
"
squire
,
who
changed
countenance
,
and
with
a
faultering
accent
observed
,
"
That
it
ill
became
a
clergyman
to
be
concerned
in
quarrels
and
blood
-
shed
 
"
"
Your
insolence
to
me
(
said
Eastgate
)
<EOS>
I
should
have
bore
with
patience
,
had
not
you
cast
the
most
infamous
reflection
upon
my
order
,
the
honour
of
which
I
think
myself
in
duty
bound
to
maintain
,
even
at
the
expence
of
my
heart
's
blood
;
and
surely
it
can
be
no
crime
to
put
out
of
the
world
a
profligate
wretch
,
without
any
sense
of
principle
,
morality
,
or
religion
 
<EOS>
"
"
Thou
may'st
take
away
my
life
,
(
cried
Prankley
,
in
great
perturbation
)
but
do
n't
go
to
murder
my
character
.
  
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
has't
got
no
conscience
?
"
<EOS>
"
My
conscience
is
perfectly
quiet
(
replied
the
other
)
;
and
now
,
sir
,
we
are
upon
the
spot
 
Take
your
ground
as
near
as
you
please
;
prime
your
pistol
;
and
the
Lord
,
of
his
infinite
mercy
,
have
compassion
upon
your
miserable
soul
!
"
    
<EOS>
This
ejaculation
he
pronounced
in
a
loud
solemn
tone
,
with
his
hat
off
<EOS>
and
his
eyes
lifted
up
;
then
drawing
a
large
horse
-
pistol
,
he
presented
,
and
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
action
.
<EOS>
Prankley
took
his
distance
,
and
endeavoured
to
prime
,
but
his
hand
shook
with
such
violence
,
that
he
found
this
operation
impracticable
 
<EOS>
His
antagonist
,
seeing
how
it
was
with
him
,
offered
his
assistance
,
and
advanced
for
the
purpose
;
when
the
poor
"
squire
,
exceedingly
alarmed
at
what
he
had
heard
and
seen
,
desired
the
action
might
be
deferred
till
next
day
,
as
he
had
not
settled
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
ha'nt
made
my
will
(
said
he
)
;
my
sisters
are
not
provided
for
;
and
I
just
now
recollect
and
old
promise
,
which
my
conscience
tells
me
I
ought
to
perform
 
I
'll
first
convince
thee
,
<EOS>
that
I
'm
not
a
wretch
without
principle
,
and
then
thou
shalt
have
an
opportunity
to
take
my
life
,
which
thou
seem'st
to
thirst
after
so
eagerly
 
<EOS>
"
    
Eastgate
understood
the
hint
;
and
told
him
,
that
one
day
should
break
no
squares
;
adding
,
"
God
forbid
that
I
should
be
the
means
of
hindering
you
from
acting
the
part
of
an
honest
man
,
and
a
dutiful
brother
 
<EOS>
"
By
virtue
of
this
cessation
they
returned
peaceably
together
.
<EOS>
Prankley
forthwith
made
out
the
presentation
of
the
living
,
and
delivered
it
to
Eastgate
,
telling
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
had
now
settled
his
affairs
,
and
was
ready
to
attend
him
to
the
Firgrove
;
but
Tom
declared
he
could
not
think
of
lifting
his
hand
against
the
life
of
so
great
a
benefactor
 
<EOS>
He
did
more
:
when
they
next
met
at
the
coffee
-
house
,
he
asked
pardon
of
Mr
Prankley
,
if
in
his
passion
he
had
said
any
thing
to
give
him
offence
;
and
the
"
squire
was
so
gracious
as
to
forgive
him
with
a
cordial
shake
of
the
hand
,
declaring
that
he
did
not
like
to
be
a
variance
with
an
old
college
-
companion
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
however
,
he
left
Bath
abruptly
;
and
then
Eastgate
told
me
all
these
particulars
,
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
effects
of
his
own
sagacity
,
by
which
he
has
secured
a
living
worth
160l
.

annum

Of
my

I
have
nothing

present

but
that

He

To

<EOS>
DEAR
DICK
,
I
SHALL
to
-
morrow
set
out
for
London
,
where
I
have
bespoke
lodgings
,
at
Mr
Norton
's
Golden
-
square
.
<EOS>
Although
I
am
no
admirer
of
Bath
,
I
shall
leave
it
with
regret
;
because
I
must
part
with
some
old
friends
,
whom
,
in
all
probability
,
I
shall
never
see
again
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
coffee
-
house
conversation
,
I
had
often
heard
very
extraordinary
encomiums
passed
on
the
performances
of
Mr
T
#
#
#
#
a
gentleman
residing
in
this
place
,
who
paints
landscapes
for
his
amusement
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
no
great
confidence
in
the
taste
and
judgment
of
coffee
-
house
connoisseurs
,
and
never
received
much
pleasure
from
this
branch
of
the
art
,
those
general
praises
made
no
impression
at
all
on
my
curiosity
;
but
at
the
request
of
a
particular
friend
,
I
went
yesterday
to
see
the
pieces
,
which
had
been
so
warmly
commended
  
I
must
own
I
am
no
judge
of
painting
,
though
very
fond
of
pictures
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
imagine
that
my
senses
would
play
me
so
false
,
as
to
betray
me
into
admiration
of
any
thing
that
was
very
bad
;
but
,
true
it
is
,
I
have
often
overlooked
capital
beauties
,
in
pieces
of
extraordinary
merit
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
not
totally
devoid
of
taste
,
however
,
this
young
gentleman
of
Bath
is
the
best
landscape
painter
now
living
:
I
was
struck
with
his
performances
in
such
a
manner
,
as
I
had
never
been
by
painting
before
.
<EOS>
His
trees
not
only
have
a
richness
of
foilage
and
warmth
of
colouring
,
which
delights
the
view
;
but
also
a
certain
magnificence
in
the
disposition
,
and
spirit
in
the
expression
,
which
I
can
not
describe
.
<EOS>
His
management
of
the
chiaro
obscuro
,
or
light
and
shadow
,
especially
gleams
of
sun
-
shine
,
is
altogether
wonderful
,
both
in
the
contrivance
and
execution
;
and
he
is
so
happy
in
his
perspective
,
and
marking
his
distances
at
sea
,
by
a
progressive
series
of
ships
,
vessels
,
capes
,
and
promontories
,
that
I
could
not
help
thinking
,
I
had
a
distant
view
of
thirty
leagues
upon
the
back
-
ground
of
the
picture
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
any
taste
for
ingenuity
left
in
degenerate
age
,
fast
thinking
into
barbarism
,
this
artist
,
I
apprehend
,
will
make
a
capital
figure
,
as
soon
as
his
works
are
known
     
Two
days
ago
,
I
was
favoured
with
a
visit
by
Mr
Fitz
-
owen
;
who
,
with
great
formality
,
solicited
my
vote
and
interest
at
the
general
election
.
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
have
been
shocked
at
the
confidence
of
this
man
;
though
it
was
remarkable
,
considering
what
had
passed
between
him
and
me
on
a
former
occasion
 
<EOS>
These
visits
are
mere
matter
of
form
,
which
a
candidate
makes
to
every
elector
;
even
to
those
who
,
he
knows
,
are
engaged
in
the
interest
of
his
competitor
,
lest
he
should
expose
himself
to
the
imputation
of
pride
,
at
a
time
when
it
is
expected
he
should
appear
humble
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
know
nothing
so
object
as
the
behaviour
of
a
man
canvassing
for
a
seat
in
a
parliament
 
<EOS>
This
mean
prostration
,
(
to
borough
-
electors
,
especially
)
has
,
I
imagine
,
contributed
in
a
great
measure
to
raise
that
spirit
of
insolence
among
the
vulgar
;
which
,
like
the
devil
,
will
be
found
very
difficult
to
lay
.
<EOS>
Be
that
<EOS>
as
it
may
,
I
was
in
some
confusion
at
the
effrontery
of
Fitz
-
owen
;
but
I
soon
recollected
myself
,
and
told
him
,
I
had
not
yet
determined
for
when
I
should
give
my
vote
,
not
whether
I
should
give
it
for
any
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
,
is
I
look
upon
both
candidates
in
the
same
light
;
and
should
think
myself
a
traitor
to
the
constitution
of
my
country
,
if
I
voted
for
either
.
<EOS>
If
every
elector
would
bring
the
same
consideration
home
to
his
conscience
,
we
should
not
have
such
reason
to
exclaim
against
the
venality
of
p####ts
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
all
a
pack
of
venal
and
corrupted
rascals
;
so
lost
to
all
sense
of
honestly
,
and
all
tenderness
of
character
,
that
,
in
a
little
time
,
I
am
fully
persuaded
,
nothing
will
be
infamous
but
virtue
and
public
-
spirit
.

,
who
is
really
an
enthusiast
in
patriotism
,
and
represented
the
capital
in
several
successive
parliaments
,
declared
to
me
t'other
day
,
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
,
that
he
had
lived
above
thirty
years
in
the
city
of
London
,
and
dealt
in
the
way
of
commerce
with
all
the
citizens
of
note
in
their
turns
;
but
that
,
as
he
should
answer
to
God
,
he
had
never
,
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
,
found
above
three
or
four
whom
he
could
call
thoroughly
honest
:
a
declaration
,
which
was
rather
mortifying
than
surprizing
to
me
;
who
have
sourd
so
few
men
of
worth
in
the
course
of
my
acquaintance
,
that
they
serve
only
as
exceptions
;
which
,
in
the
grammarian
's
phrase
,
confirm
and
prove
a
general
canon
  
<EOS>
I
know
you

saw
imperfectly
through
the
mist
of
prejudice
,
and
I
am
rankled
by
the
spleen
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
you
are
partly
in
the
right
;
for
I
have
perceived
that
my
opinion
of
mankind
,
like
mercury
in
the
thermometor
,
rises
and
falls
according
to
the
variations
of
the
weather
.
    
<EOS>
Pray
settle
accounts
with
Barnes
;
take
what
money
of
mine
is
in
his
hands
,
and
give
him
acquittance
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
Davis
has
stock
or
credit
enough
to
do
justice
to
the
farm
,
give
him
a
discharge
for
the
rent
that
is
due
:
this
will
animate
his
industry
;
for
I
know
that
nothing
is
so
discouraging
to
a
farmer
,
as
the
thoughts
of
being
in
arreats
with
his
landlord
.
<EOS>
He
becomes
dispirited
,
and
neglects
his
labour
;
and
so
the
farm
goes
to
wreck
.
<EOS>
Tabby
has
been
clamouring
for
some
days
about
the
lamb
's
skin
,
which
Williams
,
the
hind
,
begged
of
me
,
when
he
was
last
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
take
it
back
,
paying
the
fellow
the
full
value
of
it
,
that
I
may
have
some
peace
in
my
own
house
;
and
let
him
keep
his
own
counsel
,
if
he
means
to
keep
his
place
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
presume
to
despite
or
censure
any
poor
man
,
for
suffering
himself
to
be
henpecked
;
conscious
how
I
myself
am
obliged
to
truckle
to
a
domestic
daemon
;
even
though
(
blessed
be
God

<EOS>
she
is
not
yoked
with
me
for
life
,
in
the
matrimonial
waggon
 
She
has
quarrelled
with
the
servants
of
the

about
vails
;
and
such
intolerable
scolding
ensued
on
both
sides

that
I
have
been
fain
to
appease
the
cook
and
chamber

by
stealth

I

got

my

I
suppose

I

surprized

you
would
offer

put
my

the

<EOS>
I
have
toiled

As

ne'er

There
's
a

at

consumptive
;
and
<EOS>
the
Scots

have
begun

already

in
such
quantities

that
there
is
not

I
'll
have

sent
twice

sold

so

I
hope

you

not
go
to
put
any
more
such
phims
in
my

To
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
of
Jesus
college

Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
WITHOUT
waiting
for
your
answer
to
my
last
,
I
proceed
to
give
you
an
account
of
our
journey
to
London
,
which
has
not
been
wholly
barren
of
adventure
.
<EOS>
Tuesday
last
,
the
"
squire
took
his
place
in
a
hired
coach
and
four
,
accompanied
by
his
sister
and
mine
,
and
Mrs
Tabby
's
maid
,
Winifred
Jenkins
,
whose
province
it
was
to
support
Chowder
on
a
cushion
in
her
lap
.
<EOS>
I
could
scarce
refrain
from
laughing
,
when
I
looked
into
the
vehicle
,
and
saw
that
animal
sitting
opposite
to
my
uncle
,
like
any
other
passenger
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
,
ashamed
of
his
situation
,
blushed
to
the
eyes
:
and
,
calling
to
the
postillions
to
drive
on
,
pulled
the
glass
up
in
my
face
.
<EOS>
I
,
and
his
servant
John
Thomas
,
attended
them
on
horseback
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
worth
mentioning
occurred
,
till
we
arrived
on
the
edge
of
Marlborough
Downs
.
<EOS>
There
one
of
the
four
horses
fell
,
in
going
down
hill
at
a
round
trot
;
and
the
postillion
behind
,
endeavouring
to
stop
the
carriage
,
pulled
it
on
one
side
into
a
deep
rut
,
where
it
was
fairly
overturned
.
<EOS>
I
had
rode
on
about
two
hundred
yards
before
;
but
,
hearing
a
loud
scream
,
galloped
back
and
dismounted
,
to
give
what
assistance
was
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
When
I
looked
into
the
coach
,
I
could
see
nothing
distinctly
,
but
the
nether
end
of
Jenkins
,
who
was
kicking
her
heels
and
squalling
with
great
vociferation
.
<EOS>
All
on
a
sudden
,
my
uncle
thrust
up
his
bar
pate
,
and
bolted
through
the
window
,
as
nimble
as
a
grashopper
,
having
made
use
of
poor
Win
's
posteriors
as
a
step
in
rise
in
his
ascent
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
(
who
had
likewise
quitted
his
horse
)
dragged
this
forlorn
damsel
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
through
the
same
opening
.
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Bramble
,
pulling
the
door
off
its
hinges
with
a
jerk
,
laid
hold
on
Liddy
's
arm
,
and
brought
her
to
the
light
;
very
much
frighted
,
but
little
hurt
.
<EOS>
It
fell
to
my
share
to
deliver
our
aunt
Tabitha
,
who
had
lost
her
cap
in
the
struggle
;
and
being
rather
more
than
half
frantic
,
with
rage
and
terror
,
was
no
bad
representation
of
one
of
the
sister
Furies
that
guard
the
gates
of
hell
 
<EOS>
She
expressed
no
sort
of
concern
for
her
brother
,
who
ran
about
in
the
cold
,
without
his
periwig
,
and
worked
with
the
most
astonishing
agility
,
in
helping
to
disentangle
the
horses
from
the
carriage
:
but
she
cried
,
in
a
tone
of
distraction
,
"
Chowder
!
<EOS>
Chowder
!
<EOS>
my
dear
Chowder
!
<EOS>
my
poor
Chowder
is
certainly
killed
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
case
 
<EOS>
Chowder
,
after
having
tore
my
uncle
's
leg
in
the
confusion
of
the
fall
,
had
retreated
under
the
seat
,
and
from
thence
the
footman
drew
him
by
the
neck
;
for
which
good
office
he
bit
his
fingers
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
,
who
is
naturally
surly
,
was
so
provoked
at
this
assault
,
that
he
saluted
his
ribs
with
a
hearty
kick
,
exclaiming
,
"
Damn
the
nasty
son
of
a
bitch
,
and
them
that
he
belongs
to
!
"
<EOS>
A
benediction
,
which
was
by
no
means
lost
upon
the
implacable
virago
his
mistress
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
however
,
prevailed
upon
her
,
to
retire
into
a
peasant
's
house
,
near
the
scene
of
action
,
where
his
head
and
hers
were
covered
,
and
poor
Jenkins
had
a
fit
 
<EOS>
Our
next
care
was
to
apply
some
sticking
-
plaister
to
the
wound
in
his
leg
,
which
exhibited
the
impression
of
Chowder
's
teeth
;
but
he
never
opened
his
lips
against
the
delinquent
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabby
,
alarmed
at
this
scene
,
"
You
say
nothing
,
Matt
(
cried
she
)
;
but
I
know
your
mind
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
spite
you
have
to
that
poor
unfortunate
animal
!
<EOS>
I
know
you
intend
to
take
his
life
away
!
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
,
upon
my
honour
!
<EOS>
(
replied
the
"
squire
,
with
sarcastic
smile
)
<EOS>
I
should
be
incapable
of
harbouring
any
such
cruel
design
against
an
object
so
amiable
and
inoffensive
;
even
if
he
had
not
the
happiness
to
be
your
favourite
.
"
    
<EOS>
John
Thomas
was
not
so
delicate
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
,
whether
really
alarmed
for
his
life
,
or
instigated
by
the
desire
of
revenge
,
came
in
,
and
bluntly
demanded
,
that
the
dog
should
be
put
to
death
;
on
the
supposition
,
that
if
ever
he
should
run
mad
hereafter
,
he
,
who
had
been
bit
by
him
,
would
be
infected
 
My
uncle
calmly
argued
upon
the
absurdity
of
his
opinion
,
observing
,
that
he
himself
was
in
the
same
predicament
,
and
would
certainly
take
the
precaution
he
proposed
,
if
he
was
not
sure
he
ran
no
risque
of
infection
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Thomas
continued
obstinate
;
and
,
at
length
,
declared
,
that
if
the
dog
was
not
shot
immediately
,
he
himself
would
be
his
executioner
 
<EOS>
This
declaration
opened
the
flood
-
gates
of
Tabby
's
eloquence
,
which
would
have
shamed
the
first
rate
oratress
of
Billingsgate
.
<EOS>
The
footman
retorted
in
the
same
stile
;
and
the
"
squire
dismissed
him
from
his
service
,
after
having
prevented
me
from
giving
him
a
good
horse
-
whipping
for
his
insolËnce
.
    
<EOS>
The
coach
being
adjusted
,
another
difficulty
occurred
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
absolutely
refused
to
enter
it
again
,
unless
another
driver
could
be
found
to
take
the
place
of
the
postillion
;
who
,
she
affirmed
,
had
overturned
the
carriage
from
malice
aforethought
  
<EOS>
After
much
dispute
,
the
man
resigned
his
place
to
a
shabby
country
fellow
,
who
undertook
to
go
as
far
as
Marlborough
,
where
they
could
be
better
provided
;
and
at
that
place
we
arrived
about
one
o'clock
,
without
farther
impediment
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Bramble
,
however
,
found
new
matter
of
offence
;
which
,
indeed
,
she
had
a
particular
genius
for
extracting
at
will
from
almost
every
incident
in
life
.
<EOS>
We
had
scarce
entered
the
room
at
Marlborough
,
where
we
stayed
to
dine
,
when
she
exhibited
a
formal
complaint
against
the
poor
fellow
who
had
superseded
the
postillion
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
he
was
such
a
beggarly
rascal
,
that
he
had
ne'er
a
shirt
to
his
back
;
and
had
the
impudence
to
shock
her
sight
by
shewing
his
bare
posteriors
,
for
which
act
of
indelicacy
he
deserved
to
be
set
in
the
stocks
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
confirmed
the
assertion
,
with
respect
to
his
nakedness
,
observing
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
had
a
skin
as
fair
as
alabaster
.
    
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
heinous
offence
,
indeed
,
(
cried
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
let
us
hear
what
the
fellow
has
to
say
in
his
own
vindication
.
<EOS>
"
He
was
accordingly
summoned
and
made
his
appearance
,
which
was
equally
queer
and
pathetic
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
about
twenty
years
of
age
,
of
a
middling
size
,
with
bandy
legs
,
stooping
shoulders
,
high
forehead
,
sandy
locks
,
pinking
eyes
,
flat
nose
,
and
long
chin
 
but
<EOS>
his
complexion
was
of
a
sickly
yellow
:
his
looks
denoted
famine
;
and
the
rags
that
he
wore
<EOS>
,
could
hardly
conceal
what
decency
requires
to
be
covered
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
having
surveyed
him
attentively
,
said
,
with
an
ironical
expression
in
his
countenance
,
"
An't
you
<EOS>
ashamed
,
fellow
,
to
ride
postilion
without
a
shirt
to
cover
your
backside
from
the
view
of
the
ladies
in
the
coach
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
,
an
please
your
noble
honour
(
answered
the
man
)
;
but
necessity
has
no
law
,
as
the
saying
is
 
And
more
than
that
,
it
was
an
accident
 
<EOS>
My
breeches
cracked
behind
,
after
I
had
got
into
the
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
"
You
're
an
impudent
varlet
,
(
cried
Mrs
Tabby
)
for
presuming
to
ride
before
persons
of
fashion
without
a
shirt
 
<EOS>
"
"
I
am
so
,
an
please
your
worthy
ladyship
(
said
he
)
;
but
I
'm
a
poor
Wiltshire
lad
.
  
<EOS>
I
ha'nt
a
shirt
in
the
world
,
that
I
can
call
my
own
,
nor
a
rag
of
clothes
,
an
please
your
ladyship
,
but
what
you
see
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
friend
,
nor
relation
upon
earth
to
help
me
out
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
fever
and
ague
these
six
months
,
and
spent
all
I
had
in
the
world
upon
doctors
,
and
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
;
and
,
saving
your
ladyship
's
good
presence
<EOS>
,
I
ha'n't
broke
bread
these
four
and
twenty
hours
 
"
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Bramble
,
turning
from
him
,
said
,
she
had
never
seen
such
a
filthy
tatterdemalion
,
and
bid
him
begone
;
observing
,
that
he
would
fill
the
room
full
of
vermin
 
<EOS>
Her
brother
darted
a
significant
glance
at
her
,
as
she
retired
with
Liddy
into
another
apartment
;
and
then
asked
the
man
if
he
was
known
to
any
person
in
Marlborough
?
  
<EOS>
When
he
answered
,
that
the
landlord
of
the
inn
had
known
him
from
his
infancy
;
mine
host
was
immediately
called
,
and
being
interrogated
on
the
subject
,
declared
that
the
young
fellow
's
name
was
Humphrey
Clinker
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
been
a
love
-
begotten
babe
,
brought
up
in
the
work
-
house
,
and
put
out
apprentice
by
the
parish
to
a
country
black
-
smith
,
who
died
before
<EOS>
the
boy
's
time
was
out
:
that
he
had
for
some
time
worked
under
his
ostler
,
as
a
helper
and
extra
-
postilion
,
till
he
was
taken
ill
of
the
ague
,
which
disabled
him
from
getting
his
bread
:
that
,
having
sold
or
pawned
every
thing
he
had
in
the
world
for
his
cure
and
subsistence
,
he
became
so
miserable
and
shabby
,
that
he
disgraced
the
stable
,
and
was
dismissed
;
but
that
he
never
heard
any
thing
to
the
prejudice
of
his
character
in
other
respects
.
"
<EOS>
So
that
the
fellow
being
sick
and
destitute
,
(
said
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
you
turned
him
out
to
die
in
the
streets
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
pay
the
poor
's
rate
(
replied
the
other
)
,
and
I
have
no
right
to
maintain
idle
vagrants
either
in
sickness
or
health
:
besides
,
such
a
miserable
object
would
have
brought
a
discredit
upon
my
house
 
"
    
"
You
perceive
(
said
the
"
squire
turning
to
me
)
<EOS>
our
landlord
is
a
Christian
of
bowels
 
Who
shall
presume
to
censure
the
morals
of
the
age
when
the
very
publicans
exhibit
such
examples
of
humanity
?
  
<EOS>
Hark
ye
,
Clinker
<EOS>
,
you
are
a
most
notorious
offender
 
<EOS>
You
stand
<EOS>
convicted
of
sickness
,
hunger
,
wretchedness
and
want
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
it
does
not
belong
to
me
to
punish
criminals
,
I
will
only
take
upon
me
the
task
of
giving
you
a
word
of
advice
 
Get
a
shirt
with
all
convenient
dispatch
,
that
your
nakedness
may
not
henceforward
give
offence
to
travelling
gentlewomen
,
especially
maidens
in
years
 
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
put
a
guinea
in
the
hand
of
the
poor
fellow
,
who
stood
staring
at
him
in
silence
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
till
the
landlord
pushed
him
out
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
,
as
our
aunt
stept
into
the
coach
,
she
observed
,
with
some
marks
of
satisfaction
,
that
the
postillion
,
who
rode
next
to
her
,
was
not
a
shabby
wretch
like
the
ragamuffin
who
had
drove
them
to
Marlborough
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
difference
was
very
conspicuous
:
this
was
a
smart
fellow
,
with
a
narrow
brimmed
hat
,
with
gold
cording
,
a
cut
bob
,
a
decent
blue
jacket
,
leather
breeches
,
and
a
clean
linen
shirt
,
pussed
above
the
waist
-
band
.
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
the
castle
on
Spin
-
hill
,
where
we
lay
,
this
new
postillion
was
remarkably
assiduous
,
in
bringing
in
the
loose
parcels
;
and
,
at
length
,
displayed
the
individual
countenance
of
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
had
metamorphosed
himself
in
this
manner
,
by
relieving
from
pawn
part
of
his
own
cloaths
,
with
the
money
he
had
received
from
Mr
Bramble
.
    
<EOS>
Howsoever
pleased
the
rest
of
the
company
were
with
such
a
favourable
change
in
the
appearance
of
this
poor
creature
,
it
soured
on
the
stomach
of
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
had
not
yet
digested
the
affront
of
his
naked
skin
 
<EOS>
She
tossed
her
nose
in
disdain
,
saying
,
she
supposed
her
brother
had
taken
him
into
favour
,
because
he
had
insulted
her
with
his
obscenity
;
that
a
fool
and
his
money
were
soon
parted
:
but
that
if
Matt
.
<EOS>
intended
to
take
the
fellow
with
him
to
London
,
she
would
not
go
a
foot
further
that
way
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
said
nothing
with
his
tongue
,
though
his
looks
were
sufficiently
expressive
;
and
next
morning
Clinker
-
did
not
appear
,
so
that
we
proceeded
without
further
alteration
to
Salt
-
hill
,
where
we
proposed
to
dine
 
There
,
the
first
person
that
came
to
the
side
of
the
coach
,
and
began
to
adjust
the
footboard
,
was
no
other
than
Humphry
Clinker
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
handed
out
Mrs
Bramble
,
she
eyed
him
with
a
furious
look
,
and
passed
into
the
house
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
embarrassed
,
and
asked
him
peevishly
what
had
brought
him
hither
?
<EOS>
The
fellow
said
,
his
honour
had
been
so
good
to
him
,
that
he
had
not
the
heart
to
part
with
him
;
that
he
would
follow
him
to
the
world
's
end
,
and
serve
him
all
the
days
of
his
life
without
fee
or
reward
     
Mr
Bramble
did
not
know
whether
to
chide
or
laugh
at
this
declaration
 
<EOS>
He
foresaw
much
contradiction
on
the
side
of
Tabby
;
and
,
on
the
other
hand
,
he
could
not
but
be
pleased
with
the
gratitude
of
Clinker
,
as
well
as
with
the
simplicity
of
his
character
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
was
inclined
to
take
you
into
my
service
,
(
said
he
)
what
are
your
qualifications
?
<EOS>
what
are
you
good
for
"
<EOS>
"
An
please
your
honour
,
(
answered
this
original
)
<EOS>
I
can
read
and
write
,
and
do
the
business
of
the
stable
indifferent
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
I
can
dress
a
horse
,
and
shoe
him
,
and
bleed
and
rowel
him
;
and
as
for
the
practise
of
sow
-
gelding
,
I
wo
n't
turn
my
back
on
e'er
a
he
in
the
county
of
Wilts
 
<EOS>
Then
I
can
make
hog
's
puddings
and
hob
nails
,
mend
kettles
,
and
tin
sauce
-
pans
 
<EOS>
"
Here
uncle
burst
out
a
laughing
;
and
enquired
,
what
other
accomplishments
he
was
master
of
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
something
of
a
single
-
stick
,
and
psalmody
,
(
proceeded
Clinker
)
<EOS>
I
can
play
upon
the
jew
's
harp
,
sing
Black
-
ey'd
Susan
,
Arthur
o'Bradley
and
divers
other
songs
;
I
can
dance
a
Welsh
jig
,
and
Nancy
Dawson
;
wrestle
a
fall
with
any
lad
of
my
inches
,
when
I
'm
in
heart
;
and
,
under
correction
,
I
can
find
a
hare
when
your
honour
wants
a
bit
of
game
.
"
<EOS>
"
Foregad
!
thou
art
a
complete
fellow
,
(
cried
my
uncle
,
still
laughing
)
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
take
thee
into
my
family
 
Pr'ythee
<EOS>
,
go
and
try
if
thou
canst
make
peace
with
my
sister
 
Thou
hast
<EOS>
given
her
much
offence
by
shewing
her
thy
naked
tail
.
"
    
<EOS>
Clinker
accordingly
followed
us
into
the
room
,
cap
in
hand
,
where
,
addressing
himself
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
"
May
it
please
your
ladyship
's
worship
(
cried
he
)
to
pardon
and
forgive
my
offences
,
and
,
with
God
's
assistance
,
I
shall
take
care
that
my
tail
shall
never
rise
up
in
judgment
against
me
,
to
offend
your
ladyship
again
 
Do
,
pray
,
<EOS>
good
,
sweet
,
beautiful
lady
,
take
compassion
on
a
poor
sinner
 
<EOS>
God
bless
your
noble
countenance
;
I
am
sure
you
are
too
handsome
and
generous
to
bear
malice
 
I
will
serve
you
on
my
bended
knees
,
by
night
and
by
day
,
by
land
and
by
water
;
and
all
for
the
love
and
pleasure
of
serving
such
an
excellent
lady
 
"
    
<EOS>
This
compliment
and
humiliation
had
some
effect
upon
Tabby
;
but
she
made
no
reply
;
and
Clinker
,
taking
silence
for
consent
,
gave
his
attendance
at
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
's
natural
awkwardness
and
the
flutter
of
his
spirits
were
productive
of
repeated
blunders
in
the
course
of
his
attendance
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
spilt
part
of
a
custard
upon
her
right
shoulder
;
and
starting
back
,
trod
upon
Chowder
,
who
set
up
a
dismal
howl
 
<EOS>
Poor
Humphry
was
so
disconcerted
at
this
double
mistake
that
he
dropt
the
china
dish
,
which
broke
into
a
thousand
pieces
;
then
,
falling
down
upon
his
knees
,
remained
in
that
posture
gaping
,
with
a
most
ludicrous
aspect
of
distress
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Bramble
slew
to
the
dog
,
and
,
snatching
him
in
her
arms
,
presented
him
to
her
brother
,
saying
,
"
This
is
all
a
concerted
scheme
against
this
unfortunate
animal
,
whose
only
crime
is
its
regard
for
me
 
<EOS>
Here
it
is
:
kill
it
at
once
:
<EOS>
and
then
you
'll
be
satisfied
.
"
    
<EOS>
Clinker
,
hearing
these
words
,
and
taking
them
in
the
literal
acceptation
,
got
up
in
some
hurry
,
and
,
seizing
a
knife
from
the
side
-
board
,
cried
,
"
Not
here
,
an
please
your
ladyship
 
<EOS>
it
will
daub
the
room
 
<EOS>
Give
him
to
me
<EOS>
and
I
'll
carry
him
in
the
ditch
by
the
road
side
 
<EOS>
"
To
this
proposal
he
received
no
other
answer
,
than
a
hearty
box
on
the
ear
,
that
made
him
stagger
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
(
said
she
to
her
brother
)
<EOS>
am
I
to
be
affronted
by
every
mangy
hound
that
you
pick
up
in
the
highway
?
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
your
sending
this
rascallion
about
his
business
immediately
 
"
"
For
God
's
sake
,
sister
,
compose
yourself
,
(
said
my
uncle
)
and
consider
,
that
the
poor
fellow
is
innocent
of
any
intention
to
give
you
offence
 
"
"
Innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
"
 
(
cried
Humphry
.
)
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
plainly
,
(
exclaimed
this
implacable
maiden
)
<EOS>
he
acts
by
your
direction
;
and
you
are
resolved
to
support
him
in
his
impudence
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
bad
return
for
all
the
services
I
have
done
you
;
for
nursing
you
in
your
sickness
,
managing
your
family
,
and
keeping
you
from
ruining
yourself
by
your
own
imprudence
 
<EOS>
But
now
you
shall
part
with
that
rascal
or
me
,
upon
the
spot
,
without
faith
:
loss
of
time
;
and
the
world
shall
see
,
whether
you
have
more
regard
for
your
own
flesh
and
blood
,
or
for
a
beggarly
foundling
,
taken
from
the
dunghill
 
"
    
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
's
eyes
began
to
glisten
,
and
his
teeth
to
chatter
.
<EOS>
"
If
stated
fairly
,
(
said
he
,
raising
his
voice
)
<EOS>
the
question
is
,
whether
I
have
spirit
to
shake
off
an
intollerable
yoke
,
by
one
effort
of
resolution
,
or
meanness
enough
to
do
an
act
of
cruelty
and
injustice
,
to
gratify
the
rancour
of
a
capricious
woman
 
Hark
ye
,
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
I
will
now
propose
an
alternative
in
my
turn
 
<EOS>
Either
discard
your
four
-
footed
favourite
,
or
give
me
leave
to
bid
you
eternally
adieu
 
<EOS>
For
I
am
determined
that
he
and
I
shall
live
no
longer
under
the
same
roof
;
and
now
to
dinner
with
what
appetite
<EOS>
you
may
 
<EOS>
"
Thunder
-
struck
at
this
declaration
,
she
sat
down
in
a
corner
;
and
,
after
a
pause
of
some
minutes
,
"
Sure
I
do
n't
understand
you
,
Matt
!
<EOS>
(
said
the
)
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
spoke
in
plain
English
 
<EOS>
"
answered
the
"
squire
,
with
a
peremptory
look
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
,
(
resumed
this
virago
,
effectually
humbled
)
<EOS>
it
is
your
prerogative
to
command
,
and
my
duty
to
obey
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
dispose
of
the
dog
in
this
place
;
but
if
you
'll
allow
him
to
go
in
the
coach
to
London
,
I
give
you
my
word
,
he
shall
never
trouble
you
again
 
"
    
Her
brother
,
entirely
disarmed
by
this
mild
reply
,
declared
,
she
could
ask
him
nothing
in
reason
that
he
would
refuse
;
adding
,
"
I
hope
,
sister
,
you
have
never
found
me
deficient
in
natural
affection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
immediately
rose
,
and
,
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
kissed
him
on
the
cheek
:
he
returned
her
embrace
with
great
emotion
,
Liddy
sobbed
,
Win

<EOS>
Jenkins
cackled
,
Chowder
capered
,
and
Clinker
skipped
about
,
rubbing
his
hands
for
joy
of
this
reconciliation
.
    
<EOS>
Concord
being
thus
restored
,
we
finished
our
meal
with
comfort
;
and
in
the
evening
arrived
at
London
,
without
having
met
with
any
other
adventure
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
seems
to
be
much
mended
by
the
hint
she
received
from
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
graciously
pleased
to
remove
her
displeasure
from
Clinker
,
who
is
now
retained
as
a
footman
;
and
in
a
day
or
two
will
make
his
appearance
in
a
new
suit
of
livery
;
but
as
he
is
little
acquainted
with
London
,
we
have
taken
an
occasional
valet
,
whom
I
intend
hereafter
to
hire
as
my
own
servant
.
<EOS>
We
lodge
in
Golden
-
square
,
at
the
house
of
one
Mrs
Norton
,
a
decent
sort
of
a
woman
,
who
takes
great
pains
to
make
us
all
easy
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
proposes
to
make
a
circuit
of
all
the
remarkable
scenes
of
this
metropolis
,
for
the
entertainment
of
his
pupils
;
but
as
both
you
and
I
are
already
acquainted
with
most
of
those
he
will
visit
,
and
with
some
others
he
little
dreams
of
,
I
shall
only
communicate
what
will
be
in
some
measure
new
to
your
observation

Remember
me
to
our

me

To
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
LONDON
is
literally
new
to
me
;
new
in
its
streets
,
houses
,
and
even
in
its
situation
;
as
the
Irishman
said
,
"
London
is
now
gone
out
of
town
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
left
open
fields
,
producing
hay
and
corn
,
I
now
find
covered
with
streets
,
and
squares
,
and
palaces
,
and
churches
.
<EOS>
I
am
credibly
informed
that
in
the
space
of
seven
years
,
eleven
thousand
new
houses
have
been
built
in
one
quarter
of
Westminster
,
exclusive
of
what
is
daily
added
to
other
parts
of
this
unweildy
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Pimlico
and
Knightsbridge
are
now
almost
joined
to
Chelsea
and
Kensington
;
and
if
this
infatuation
continues
for
half
a
century
,
I
suppose
the
whole
county
of
Middlesex
will
be
covered
with
brick
.
    
<EOS>
It
must
be
allowed
,
indeed
for
the
credit
of
the
present
age
,
that
London
and
Westminster
are
much
better
paved
and
lighted
than
they
were
formerly
.
<EOS>
The
new
streets
are
spacious
,
regular
and
airy
;
and
the
houses
generally
convenient
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
at
Blackfriars
is
a
noble
monument
of
taste
and
public
spirit
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
they
stumbled
upon
a
work
of
such
magnificence
and
utility
.
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
these
improvements
,
the
capital
is
become
an
overgrown
monster
;
which
,
like
a
dropsical
head
,
will
in
time
leave
the
body
and
extremities
without
nourishment
and
support
.
<EOS>
The
absurdity
will
appear
in
its
full
force
,
when
we
consider
,
that
one
sixth
part
of
the
natives
of
this
whole
extensive
kingdom
,
is
crowded
within
the
bills
of
Mortality
.
<EOS>
What
wonder
that
our
villages
are
depopulated
,
and
our
farms
in
want
of
day
-
labourers
?
<EOS>
The
abolition
of
small
farms
,
is
but
one
cause
of
the
decrease
of
population
.
<EOS>
Indeed
the
incredible
increase
of
horses
and
black
cattle
,
to
answer
the
purposes
of
luxury
,
requires
a
prodigious
quantity
of
hay
and
grass
,
which
are
raised
and
managed
without
much
labour
;
but
a
number
of
hands
will
always
be
wanted
for
the
different
branches
of
agriculture
,
whether
the
farms
be
large
or
small
.
<EOS>
The
tide
of
luxury
has
swept
all
the
inhabitants
from
the
open
country
 
The
poorest
"
squire
,
as
well
as
the
richest
peer
,
must
have
his
house
in
town
,
and
make
a
figure
with
an
extraordinary
number
of
domestics
.
<EOS>
The
plough
-
boys
,
cow
-
herds
,
and
lower
hinds
,
are
debauched
and
seduced
by
the
appearance
and
discourse
of
those
coxcombs
in
livery
,
when
they
make
their
summer
excursions
.
<EOS>
They
desert
their
dirt
and
drudgery
,
and
swarm
up
to
London
,
in
hopes
of
getting
into
service
,
where
they
can
live
luxuriously
and
wear
fine
clothes
,
without
being
obliged
to
work
;
for
idleness
is
natural
to
man
 
Great
numbers
of
these
,
being
disappointed
in
their
expectation
,
become
thieves
and
sharpers
;
and
London
being
an
immense
wilderness
,
in
which
there
is
neither
watch
nor
ward
of
any
signification
,
nor
any
order
or
police
,
affords
them
lurking
-
places
as
well
as
prey
.
    
<EOS>
There
are
many
causes
that
contribute
to
the
daily
increase
of
this
enormous
mass
;
but
they
may
be
all
resolved
into
the
grand
source
of
luxury
and
corruption
 
About
five
and
twenty
years
ago
,
very
few
,
even
of
the
most
opulent
citizens
of
London
,
kept
any
equipage
,
or
even
any
servants
in
livery
.
<EOS>
Their
tables
produced
nothing
but
plain
boiled
and
roasted
,
with
a
bottle
of
port
and
a
tankard
of
beer
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
every
trader
in
any
degree
of
credit
,
every
broker
and
attorney
,
maintains
a
couple
of
footmen
,
a
coachman
and
postillion
.
<EOS>
He
has
his
town
-
house
,
and
his
country
-
house
,
his
coach
,
and
his
postchaise
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
daughters
appear
in
the
richest
stuffs
,
bespangled
with
diamonds
.
<EOS>
They
frequent
the
court
,
the
opera
,
the
theatre
,
and
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
They
hold
assemblies
at
their
own
houses
:
they
make
sumptuous
entertainments
,
and
treat
with
the
richest
wines
of
Bourdeaux
,
Burgundy
,
and
Champagne
.
<EOS>
The
substantial
tradesman
,
who
wo

to
pass
his
evenings
at
the
ale
-
house
for
four

pence
half
penny
,
now
spends
three
shillings
at
the
tavern
,
while
his
wife
keeps
card
-
tables
at
home
;
she
must
likewise
have
fine
clothes
,
her
chaise
,
or
pad
,
with
country
lodgings
,
and
go
three
times
a
week
to
public
diversions
.
<EOS>
Every
clerk
,
apprentice
,
and
even
waiter
of
tavern
or
Coffee
-
house
,
maintains
a
gelding
by
himself
,
or
in
partnership
,
and
assumes
the
air
and
apparel
of
a
petit
maitre
 
<EOS>
The
gayest
places
of
public
entertainment
are
filled
with
fashionable
figures
;
which
,
upon
enquiry
,
will
be
found
to
be
journeymen
taylors
,
servingmen
,
and
abigails
,
disguised
like
their
betters
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
is
no
distinction
or
subordination
lest
 
<EOS>
The
different
departments
of
life
are
jumbled
together
 
<EOS>
The
hod
-
carrier
,
the
low
mechanic
,
the
tapster
,
the
publican
,
the
shop
-
keeper
,
the
pettisogger
,
the
citizen
,
and
courtier
,
all
tread
upon
the
kibes
of
one
another
:
actuated
by
the
demons
of
profligacy
and
licentiousness
,
they
are
seen
every
where
,
rambling
,
riding
,
rolling
,
rushing
,
justling
,
mixing
,
bouncing
,
cracking
,
and
crashing
in
one
vile
ferment
of
stupidity
and
corruption
 
<EOS>
All
is
tumult
and
hurry
;
one
would
imagine
they
were
impelled
by
some
disorder
of
the
brain
,
that
will
not
suffer
them
to
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
The
foot
-
passengers
run
along
as
if
they
were
pursued
by
bailiffs
.
<EOS>
The
porters
and
chairmen
trot
with
their
burdens
.
<EOS>
People
,
who
keep
their
own
equipages
,
drive
through
the
streets
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
Even
citizens
,
physicians
,
and
apothecaries
,
glide
in
their
chariots
like
lightning
.
<EOS>
The
hackney
-
coachmen
make
their
horses
smoke
,
and
the
pavement
shakes
under
them
;
and
I
have
actually
seen
a
waggon
pass
through
Piccadilly
at
the
hand
-
gallop
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
whole
nation
seems
to
be
running
out
of
their
wits
.
    
<EOS>
The
diversions
of
the
times
are
not
ill
-
suited
to
the
genius
of
this
incongrous
monster
,
called
the
public
.
<EOS>
Give
it
noise
,
confusion
,
glare
,
and
glitter
;
it
has
no
idea
of
elegance
and
propriety
 
<EOS>
What
are
the
amusements
at
Ranclagh
?
<EOS>
One
half
of
the
company
are
following
one
another
's
tails
,
in
an
eternal
circle
;
like
so
many
blind
asses
in
an
olive
-
mill
;
where
they
can
neither
discourse
,
distinguish
,
nor
be
distinguished
;
while
the
other
half
are
drinking
hot
water
,
under
the
denomination
of
tea
,
till
nine
or
ten
o'clock
at
night
,
to
keep
them
awake
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
orchestra
,
the
vocal
musick
especially
,
it
is
well
for
the
performers
that
they
can
not
be
heard
distinctly
.
<EOS>
Vauxhall
is
a
composition
of
baubles
,
overcharged
with
paltry
ornaments
,
ill
-
conceived
,
and
poorly
executed
;
without
any
unity
of
design
,
or
propriety
of
disposition
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
unnatural
assembly
of
objects
,
fantastically
illuminated
in
broken
masses
;
seemingly
contrived
to
dazzle
the
eyes
and
divert
the
imagination
of
the
vulgar
 
Here
a
wooden
lion
,
there
a
stone
statue
;
in
one
place
,
a
range
of
things
like
coffee
-
house
boxes
,
covered
atop
;
in
another
,
a
parcel
of
ale
-
house
benches
;
in
a
third
,
a
puppet
shew
representation
of
a
tin
cascade
;
in
a
fourth
,
a
gloomy
cave
of
a
circular
form
,
like
a
sepulchral
vault
half
-
lighted
;
in
a
fifth
,
a
scanty
slip
of
grass
-
plat
,
that
would
not
afford
pasture
sufficient
for
an
ass
's
colt
.
<EOS>
The
walks
,
which
nature
seems
to
have
intended
for
solitude
,
shade
,
and
silence
,
are
filled
with
crowds
of
noisy
people
,
sucking
up
the
nocturnal
rheums
of
an
aguish
climate
;
and
through
these
gay
scenes
,
a
few
lamps
glimmer
like
so
many
farthing
candles
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
see
a
number
of
well
-
dressed
people
,
of
both
sexes
,
sitting
on
the
covered
benches
,
exposed
to
the
eyes
of
the
mob
;
and
,
which
is
worse
,
to
the
cold
,
raw
,
night
-
air
,
devouring
sliced
beef
,
and
swilling
port
,
and
punch
,
and
cider
,
I
ca
n't
help
compassionating
their
temerity
,
while
I
despise
their
want
of
taste
and
decorum
;
but
,
when
they
course
along
those
damp
and
gloomy
walks
,
or
crowd
together
upon
the
wet
gravel
,
without
any
other
cover
than
the
cope
of
Heaven
,
listening
to
a
song
,
which
one
half
of
them
can
not
possibly
hear
,
how
can
I
help
supposing
they
are
actually
possessed
by
a
spirit
more
absurd
and
pernicious
than
any
thing
we
meet
with
in
the
precincts
of
Bedlam
?
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
the
proprietors
of
this
,
and
other
public
gardens
of
inferior
note
,
in
the
skirts
of
the
metropolis
,
are
,
in
some
shape
,
connected
with
the
faculty
of
physic
,
and
the
company
of
undertakers
;
for
,
considering
that
eagerness
in
the
pursuit
of
what
is
called
pleasure
,
which
now
predominates
through
every
rank
and
denomination
of
life
,
I
am
persuaded
,
that
more
gouts
,
rheumatisms
,
catarrhs
,
and
consumptions
are
caught
in
these
nocturnal
pastimes
,
sub
die
,
than
from
all
the
risques
and
accidents
to
which
a
life
of
toil
and
danger
is
exposed
.
    
<EOS>
These
and
other
observations
,
which
I
have
made
in
this
excursion
,
will
shorten
my
stay
at
London
,
and
send
me
back
with
a
double
relish
to
my
solitude
and
mountains
;
but
I
shall
return
by
a
different
route
from
that
which
brought
me
to
town
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
some
old
friends
,
who
constantly
resided
in
this
virtuous
metropolis
,
but
they
are
so
changed
in
manners
,
and
disposition
,
that
we
hardly
know
or
care
for
one
another
 
<EOS>
In
our
journey
from
Bath
,
my
sister
Tabby
provoked
me
into
a
transport
of
passion
;
during
which
,
like
a
man
who
has
drank
himself
pot
valiant
,
I
talked
to
her
in
such
a
stile
of
authority
and
resolution
,
as
produced
a
most
blessed
effect
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
dog
have
been
remarkably
quiet
and
orderly
,
ever
since
this
expostulation
.
<EOS>
How
long
this
agreeable
calm
will
last
,
Heaven
above
knows
 
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
the
exercise
of
travelling
has
been
of
service
to
my
health
;
a
circumstance
,
which
encourages
me
to
proceed
in
my
projected
expedition
to
the
North
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
,
in
the
mean
time
,
for
the
benefit
and
amusement
of
my
pupils
,
explore
the
depths
of
this
chaos
;
this
mishapen
and
monstrous
capital
,
without
head
or
tail
,
members
or
proportion
.
    
<EOS>
Thomas
was
so
insolent
to
my
sister
on
the
road
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
turn
him
off
abruptly
,
betwixt
Chippenham
and
Marlborough
,
where
our
coach
was
overturned
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
was
always
sullen
and
selfish
;
but
,
if
he
should
return
to
the
country
,
you
may
give
him
a
character
for
honestly
and
sobriety
;
and
,
provided
he
behaves
with
proper
respect
to
the
family

let
him
have
a
couple
of
guineas

the
name
    
yours

MY
DEAR
LETTY
<EOS>
,
INEXPRESSIBLE
was
the
pleasure
I
received
from
yours
of
the
25th

which
was
last
night
put
into

<EOS>
I
rejoice
to
hear
that
my

good
health

still
more

that
she
no
longer
retains
any
displeasure
towards
her
poor
Liddy
<EOS>
,
I
am
sorry
you
have
lost
the
society
of
the
agreeable
miss
Vaughan
;
but
,
I
hope
,
you
wo
n't
have
cause
much
longer
to
regret
the
departure
of
your
school
companions
,
as
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
your
parents
will
,
in
a
little
time
,
bring
you
into
the
world
,
where
you
are
so
well
,
qualified
to
make
a
distinguished
figure
.
<EOS>
When
that
is
the
case
,
I
flatter
myself
you
<EOS>
and
I
shall
meet
again
,
and
be
happy
together
;
and
even
improve
the
friendship
which
we
contracted
in
our
tender
years
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
at
least
I
can
promise
 
It
shall
not
be
for
the
want
of
my
utmost
endeavours

if
our
intimacy
does
not
continue
for
life

About
five
days
ago
we
arrived
in
London
,
after
an
easy
journey
from
Bath
;
during
which
,
however
,
we
were
overturned
,
and
met
with
some
other
little
incidents
,
which
had
like
to
have
occasioned
a
misunderstanding
betwixt
my
uncle
and
aunt
;
but
now
,
thank
God
,
they
are
happily
reconciled
:
we
live
in
harmony
together
,
and
every
day
make
parties
to
see
the
wonders
of
this
vast
metropolis
,
which
,
however
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
describe
;
for
I
have
not
as
yet
seen
one
hundredth
part
of
its
curiosities
,
and
I
am
quite
in
a
maze
of
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
The
cities
of
London
and
Westminster
are
spread
out
into
an
incredible
extent
.
<EOS>
The
streets
,
squares
,
rows
,
lanes
,
and
alleys
,
are
innumerable
.
<EOS>
Palaces
,
public
buildings
,
and
churches
,
rise
in
every
quarter
;
and
among
these
last
,
St.
Paul
's
appears
with
the
most
astonishing
preeminence
.
<EOS>
They
say
it
is
not
so
large
as
St.
Peter
's
at
Rome
;
but
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
have
no
idea
of
any
earthly
temple
more
grand
and
magnificent
.
    
<EOS>
But
even
these
superb
objects
are
not
so
striking
as
the
crowds
of
people
that
swarm
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
I
at
first
imagined
,
that
some
great
assembly
was
just
dismissed
,
and
wanted
to
stand
aside
till
the
multitude
should
pass
;
but
this
human
tide
continues
to
slow
,
without
interruption
or
abatement
,
from
morn
till
night
.
<EOS>
Then
there
is
such
an
infinity
of
gay
equipages
,
coaches
,
chariots
,
chaises
,
and
other
carriages
,
continually
rolling
and
shifting
before
your
eyes
,
that
one
's
head
grows
giddy
looking
at
them
;
and
the
imagination
is
quite
confounded
with
splendour
and
variety
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
the
prospect
by
water
less
grand
,
and
astonishing
than
that
by
land
<EOS>
:
you
see
three
stupendous
bridges
,
joining
the
opposite
banks
of
a
broad
,
deep
,
and
rapid
river
;
so
vast
,
so
stately
,
so
elegant
,
that
they
seem
to
be
the
work
of
giants
<EOS>
:
betwixt
them
,
the
whole
surface
of
the
Thames
is
covered
with
small
vessels
,
barges
,
boats
,
and
wherries
,
passing
to
and
fro
;
and
below
the
three
bridges
,
such
a
prodigious
forest
of
masts
,
for
miles
together
,
that
you
would
think
all
the
ships
in
the
universe
were
here
assembled
.
<EOS>
All
that
you
read
of
wealth
and
grandeur
in
the
Arabian
Night
's
Entertainment
,
and
the
Persian
Tales
,
concerning
Bagdad
,
Dialbekir
,
Damascus
,
Ispahan
,
and
Samarkand
,
is
here
realized
.
    
<EOS>
Ranelagh
looks
like
the
inchanted
palace
of
a
genie
,
adorned
with
the
most
exquisite
performances
of
painting
,
carving
,
and
gilding
,
enlightened
with
a
thousand
golden
lamps
,
that
emulate
the
noon
-
day
sun
;
crowded
with
the
great
,
the
rich
,
the
gay
,
the
happy
,
and
the
fair
;
glittering
with
cloth
of
gold
and
silver
,
lace
,
embroidery
,
and
precious
stones
.
<EOS>
While
these
exulting
sons
and
daughters
of
felicity
tread
this
round
of
pleasure
,
or
regale
in
different
parties
,
and
separate
lodges
,
with
fine
imperial
tea
and
other
delicious
refreshments
,
their
ears
are
entertained
with
the
most
ravishing
delights
of
musick
,
both
instrumental
and
vocal
.
<EOS>
There
I
heard
the
famous
Tenducci
,
a
thing
from
Italy
 
<EOS>
It
looks
for
all
the
world
like
a
man
,
though
they
say
it
is
not
.
  
<EOS>
The
voice
,
to
be
sure
,
is
neither
man
's
nor
woman
's
;
but
it
is
more
melodious
than
either
;
and
it
warbled
so
divinely
,
that
,
while
I
listened
,
I
really
thought
myself
in
paradise
.
    
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
,
in
a
charming
moon
-
light
evening
,
we
embarked
at
Ranelagh
for
Vauxhall
,
in
a
wherry
,
<EOS>
so
light
and
slender
<EOS>
,
that
we
looked
like
so
many
fairies
sailing
in
a
nut
-
shell
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
being
apprehensive
of
catching
cold
upon
the
water
,
went
round
in
the
coach
,
and
my
aunt
would
have
accompanied
him
,
but
he
would
not
suffer
me
to
go
by
water
if
she
went
by
land
;
and
therefore
she
favoured
us
with
her
company
,
as
she
perceived
I
had
a
curiosity
to
make
this
agreeable
voyage
 
After
all
,
the
vessel
was
sufficiently
loaded
;
for
,
besides
the
watermen
,
there
was
my
brother
Jery
,
and
a
friend
of
his
,
one
Mr
Parton
,
a
country
gentleman
,
of
a
good
fortune
,
who
had
dined
at
our
house
 
<EOS>
The
pleasure
of
this
little
excursion
was
,
however
,
damped
,
by
my
being
sadly
frighted
at
our
landing
;
where
there
was
a
terrible
confusion
of
whorries
,
and
a
crowd
of
people
hawling
,
and
swearing
,
and
quarrelling
:
nay
,
a
parcel
of
ugly
-
looking
fellows
<EOS>
came
running
into
the
water
,
and
laid
hold
on
our
boat
with
great
violence
,
to
pull
it
ashore
;
nor
would
they
quit
their
hold
till
my
brother
struck
one
of
them
over
the
head
with
his
cane
.
<EOS>
But
this
flutter
was
fully
recompensed
by
the
pleasures
of
Vauxhall
;
which
I
no
sooner
entered
,
than
I
was
dazzled
and
confounded
with
the
variety
of
beauties
that
rushed
all
at
once
upon
my
eye
.
<EOS>
Image
to
yourself
,
my
dear
Letty
,
a
spacious
garden
,
part
laid
out
in
delightful
walks
,
bounded
with
high
hedges
and
trees
,
and
paved
with
gravel
;
part
exhibiting
a
wonderful
assemblage
of
the
most
picturesque
and
striking
objects
,
pavilions
,
lodges
,
groves
,
grottoes
,
lawns
,
temples
,
and
cascades
;
porticoes
,
colonades
,
and
rotundos
;
adorned
with
pillars
,
statues
,
and
painting
:
<EOS>
the
whole
illuminated
with
an
infinite
number
of
lamps
,
disposed
in
different
figures
of
suns
,
stars
,
and
constellations
;
the
place
crowded
with
the
gayest
company
,
ranging
thro
'
those
blissful
shades
,
or
supping
in
different
lodges
,
on
cold
collations
,
enlivened
with
mirth
,
freedom
,
and
good
humour
,
and
animated
by
an
excellent
band
of
musick
.
<EOS>
Among
the
vocal
performers
I
had
the
happiness
to
hear
the
celebrated
Mrs
#
#
#
#
,
whose
voice
was
so
loud
and
so
shrill
,
that
it
made
my
head
ake
through
excess
of
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
In
about
half
an
hour
after
we
arrived
we
were
joined
by
my
uncle
,
who
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
place
.
<EOS>
People
of
experience
and
infirmity
,
my
dear
Letty
,
see
with
very
different
eyes
from
those
that
such
as
you
<EOS>
and
I
make
use
of
 
Our
evening
's
entertainment
<EOS>
was
interrupted
by
an
unlucky
accident
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
remotest
walks
we
were
surprised
with
a
sudden
shower
,
that
set
the
whole
company
a
running
,
and
drove
us
in
heaps
,
one
upon
another
,
into
the
rotundo
;
where
my
uncle
,
finding
himself
wet
,
began
to
be
very
peevish
and
urgent
to
be
gone
.
<EOS>
My
brother
went
to
look
for
the
coach
,
and
found
it
with
much
difficulty
;
but
as
it
could
not
hold
us
all
,
Mr
Barton
stayed
behind
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
the
carriage
could
be
brought
up
to
the
gate
,
in
the
confusion
,
notwithstanding
the
utmost
endeavours
of
our
new
footman
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
lost
his
scratch
periwig
,
and
got
a
broken
head
in
the
scuffle
.
<EOS>
The
moment
we
were
seated
,
my
aunt
pulled
off
my
uncle
's
shoes
,
and
carefully
wrapped
his
poor
feet
in
her
capuchin
;
then
she
gave
him
a
mouth
-
full
of
cordial
,
which
she
always
keeps
in
her
pocket
,
and
his
clothes
were
shifted
as
soon
as
we
arrived
at
our
lodgings
;
so
that
,
blessed
be
God
,
he
escaped
a
severe
cold
,
of
which
he
was
in
great
terror
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
Mr
Barton
,
I
must
tell
you
in
confidence
,
he
was
a
little
particular
;
but
,
perhaps
,
I
mistake
his
complaisance
;
and
I
wish
I
may
,
for
his
sake
  
<EOS>
You
know
the
condition
of
my
poor
heart
;
which
,
in
spite
of
hard
usage
 
<EOS>
And
yet
I
ought
not
to
complain
:
nor
will
I
,
till
,
farther
information
.
    
<EOS>
Besides
Ranelagh
and
Vauxhall
,
I
have
been
at
Mrs
Cornely
's
assembly
,
which
,
for
the
rooms
,
the
company
,
the
dresses
,
and
decorations
,
surpasses
all
description
;
but
as
I
have
no
great
turn
for
card
-
playing
,
I
have
not
yet
entered
thoroughly
into
the
spirit
of
the
place
:
Indeed
I
am
still
such
a
country
hoyden
,
that
I
could
hardly
find
patience
to
be
put
in
a
condition
to
appear
,
yet
I
was
not
above
six
hours
under
the
hands
of
the
hair
-
dresser
,
who
stuffed
my
head
with
as
much
black
wool
as
would
have
made
a
quilted
petticoat
;
and
,
after
all
,
it
was
the
smallest
head
in
the
assembly
,
except
my
aunt
's
 
She
,
to
be
sure
,
was
so
particular
with
her
rumpt
gown
and
petticoat
,
her
scanty
curls
,
her
lappet
-
head
,
deep
triple
ruffles
,
and
high
stays
,
that
every
body
looked
at
her
with
surprise
;
some
whispered
,
and
some
tittered
;
and
lady
Griskin
,
by
whom
we
were
introduced
,
flatly
told
her
,
<EOS>
she
was
twenty
good
years
behind
the
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
is
a
person
of
fashion
,
to
whom
we
have
the
honour
to
be
related
.
<EOS>
She
keeps
a
small
rout
at
her
own
house
,
never
exceeding
ten
or
a
dozen
card
-
tables
,
but
these
are
frequented
by
the
best
company
in
town
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
so
obliging
as
to
introduce
my
aunt
and
me
to
some
of
her
particular
friends
of
quality
,
who
treat
us
with
the
most
familiar
good
humour
<EOS>
:
we
have
once
dined
with
her
,
and
she
takes
the
trouble
to
direct
us
in
all
our
motions
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
happy
as
to
have
gained
her
good
will
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
sometimes
adjusts
my
cap
with
her
own
hands
;
and
she
has
given
me
a
kind
invitation
to
stay
with
her
all
the
winter
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
has
been
cruelly
declined
by
my
uncle
,
who
seems
to
be
(
I
know
not
how
)
prejudiced
against
the
good
lady
;
for
,
whenever
my
aunt
happens
to
speak
in
her
commendation
,
I
observe
that
he
makes
wry
faces
,
though
he
says
nothing
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
these
grimaces
may
be
the
effect
of
pain
arising
from
the
gout
and
rheumatism
,
with
which
he
is
sadly
distressed
 
To
me
,
however
,
he
is
always
good
natured
and
generous
,
even
beyond
my
wish
.
<EOS>
Since
we
came
hither
,
he
has
made
me
a
present
of
a
suit
of
clothes
,
with
trimmings
and
laces
,
which
cost
more
money
than
I
shall
mention
;
and
Jery
,
at
his
desire
,
has
given
me
my
mother
's
diamond
drops
,
which
are
ordered
to
be
set
a
-
new
;
so
that
it
wo
n't
be
his
fault
if
I
do
not
glitter
among
the
stars
of
the
fourth
or
fifth
magnitude
.
<EOS>
I
wish
my
weak
head
may
not
grow
giddy
in
the
midst
of
all
this
gallantry
and
dissipation
;
though
,
as
yet
,
I
can
safely
declare
,
I
could
gladly
give
up
all
these
tumultuous
pleasures
,
for
country
solitude
,
and
a
happy
retreat
with
those
we
love
;
among
whom
,
my
dear
Willis
will
always
possess
the
first
place
in
the
breast
of
her
    
ever
affectionate
,
Lydia
Melford
.

To

<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
I
SEND
you
this
letter
,
franked
by
our
old
friend
Barton
;
<EOS>
who
is
as
much
altered
as
it
was
possible
for
a
man
of
his
kidney
to
be
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
careless
<EOS>
,
indolent
sloven
we
knew
at
Oxford
<EOS>
,
I
found
him
a
busy
talkative
politician
;
a
petre
-
maitre
in
his
dress
,
and
a
ceremonious
courtier
in
his
manners
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
gall
enough
in
his
constitution
to
be
inflamed
with
the
rancour
of
party
,
so
as
to
deal
in
scurrilous
invectives
;
but
,
since
he
obtained
a
place
,
he
is
become
a
warm
partizan
of
the
ministry
,
and
sees
every
thing
through
such
an
exaggerating
medium
,
as
to
me
,
who
are
happily
of
no
party
,
is
altogether
incomprehensible
 
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
the
fumes
of
faction
not
only
disturb
the
faculty
of
reason
,
but
also
pervert
the
organs
of
sense
;
and
I
would
lay
an
hundred
guineas
to
ten
,
that
if
Barton
on
one
side
,
and
the
most
consciencious
patriot
in
the
opposition
on
the
other
,
were
to
draw
,
upon
honour
,
the
picture
of
the
k
#
#
#
#
or
m
#
#
#
#
,
you
and
I
,
who
are
still
uninfected
,
and
unbiased
,
would
find
both
painters
equally
distant
from
the
truth
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
however
,
must
be
allowed
for
the
honour
of
Barton
,
he
never
breaks
out
into
illiberal
abuse
,
far
less
endeavours
,
by
infamous
calumnies
,
to
blast
the
moral
character
of
any
individual
,
on
the
other
side
.
    
<EOS>
Ever
since
we
came
hither
,
he
has
been
remarkably
assiduous
in
his
attention
to
our
family
;
an
attention
,
which
in
a
man
of
his
indolence
and
avocations
,
I
should
have
thought
altogether
odd
,
and
even
unnatural
,
had
not
I
perceived
that
my
sister
Liddy
has
made
some
impression
upon
his
heart
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
have
any
objection
to
his
trying
his
fortune
in
this
pursuit
;
if
an
opulent
estate
,
and
a
great
stock
of
good
-
nature
are
sufficient
qualifications
in
a
husband
,
to
render
the
marriage
-
state
happy
for
life
,
she
may
be
happy
with
Barton
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
imagine
,
there
is
something
else
required
to
engage
and
secure
the
affection
of
a
woman
of
sense
and
delicacy
:
something
which
nature
has
denied
our
friend
 
Liddy
seems
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
.
<EOS>
When
he
addresses
himself
to
her
in
discourse
,
she
seems
to
listen
with
reluctance
,
and
industriously
avoids
all
particular
communication
;
but
in
proportion
to
her
coyness
,
our
aunt
is
coming
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
goes
more
than
half
way
to
meet
his
advances
;
she
mistakes
,
or
affects
to
mistake
,
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
his
courtesy
,
which
is
rather
formal
and
fulsome
<EOS>
;
she
returns
his
compliments
with
hyperbolical
interest
,
she
persecutes
him
with
her
civilities
at
table
,
she
appeals
to
him
for
ever
in
conversation
,
she
sighs
,
and
flirts
,
and
ogles
,
and
by
her
hideous
affectation
and
impertinence
,
drives
the
poor
courtier
to
the
very
extremity
of
his
complaisance
:
in
short
,
she
seems
to
have
undertaken
the
siege
of
Barton
's
heart
,
and
carries
on
her
approaches
in
such
a
desperate
manner
,
that
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
will
not
be
obliged
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
his
aversion
to
this
inamorata
struggling
with
his
acquired
affability
,
and
his
natural
fear
of
giving
offence
,
throws
him
into
a
kind
of
distress
which
is
extremely
ridiculous
.
    
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
,
he
persuaded
my
uncle
and
me
to
accompany
him
to
St.
James
's
,
where
he
undertook
took
to
make
us
acquainted
with
the
persons
of
all
the
great
men
in
the
kingdom
;
and
,
indeed
,
there
was
a
great
assemblage
of
distinguished
characters
,
for
it
was
a
high
festival
at
court
.
<EOS>
Our
conductor
performed
his
promise
with
great
punctuality
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
out
almost
every
individual
of
both
sexes
,
and
generally
introduced
them
to
our
notice
,
with
a
flourish
of
panegyrick
 
Seeing
the
King
approach
,
"
There
comes
(
said
he
)
the
most
amiable
sovereign
that
ever
swayed
the
sceptre
of
England
;
the
deliciae
humani
generis
;
Augustus
,
in
patronizing
merit
;
Titus
Vespasian
in
generosity
;
Tragan
in
benificence
;
and
Marcus
Aurelius
,
in
philosophy
.
"
<EOS>
"
A
very
honest
kind
hearted
gentleman
(
added
my
uncle
)
;
he
's
too
good
for
the
times
.
<EOS>
A
king
of
England
should
have
a
spice
of
the
devil
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Barton
,
then
turning
to
the
duke
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
proceeded
,
  
"
You
know
the
duke
;
that
illustrious
hero
,
who
trod
rebellion
under
his
feet
,
and
secured
us
in
possession
of
every
thing
we
ought
to
hold
dear
,
as
Englishmen
and
Christians
.
<EOS>
Mark
what
an
eye
<EOS>
,
how
penetrating
,
yet
pacific
!
<EOS>
what
dignity
in
his
mein
!
<EOS>
what
humanity
in
his
aspect
 
Even
malice
must
own
,
that
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
officers
in
Christendom
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
he
be
(
said
Mr
Bramble
)
;
but
who
are
these
young
gentlemen
that
stand
beside
him
?
"
<EOS>
"
Those
!
<EOS>
(
cried
our
friend
)
<EOS>
those
are
his
royal
nephews
;
the
princes
of
the
blood
.
<EOS>
Sweet
young
princes
!
<EOS>
the
sacred
pledges
of
the
Protestant
line
;
so
spirited
so
sensible
,
so
princely
 
"
"
Yes
;
very
sensible
!
<EOS>
very
spirited
!
<EOS>
(
said
my
uncle
,
interrupting
him
)
but
see
the
queen
!
<EOS>
ha
,
there
's
the
queen
 
<EOS>
There
's
the
queen
!
<EOS>
let
me
see
 
<EOS>
Let
me
see
 
<EOS>
Where
are
my
glasses
?
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
there
's
meaning
in
that
eye
 
<EOS>
There
's
sentiment
 
<EOS>
There
's
expression
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr
Barton
,
what
figure
do
you
call
next
?
<EOS>
"
The
next
person
he
pointed
out
,
was
the
favourite
yearl
;
who
stood
solitary
by
one
of
the
windows
 
<EOS>
"
Behold
yon
northern
star
,
(
said
he
)
shorn
of
his
beams
 
<EOS>
"
"
What
!
<EOS>
the
Caledonian
luminary
,
that
lately
blazed
so
bright
in
our
hemisphere
!
<EOS>
methinks
,
at
present
,
it
glimmers
through
a
fog
;
like
Saturn
without
his
ring
,
bleak
and
dim
,
and
distant
 
<EOS>
Ha
,
there
's
the
other
great
phenomenon
,
the
grand
pensionary
,
that
weather
-
cock
of
patriotism
that
veers
about
in
every
point
of
the
political
compass
,
and
still
feels
the
wind
of
popularity
in
his
tail
.
<EOS>
He
too
,
like
a
portentous
comet
,
has
risen
above
the
court
horizon
;
but
how
long
he
will
continue
to
ascend
,
it
is
not
easy
to
foretell
,
considering
his
great
eccentricity
 
<EOS>
Who
are
those
two
satellites
that
attend
his
motions
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Barton
told
him
their
names
,
"
To
their
characters
(
said
Mr
Bramble
)
<EOS>
I
am
no
stranger
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
without
a
drop
of
red
blood
in
his
veins
,
has
a
cold
,
intoxicating
vapour
in
his
head
;
and
,
rancour
enough
in
his
heart
to
inoculate
and
affect
a
whole
nation
.
<EOS>
The
other
is
(
I
hear
)
intended
for
a
share
in
the
ad####n
,
and
the
pensionary
vouches
for
his
being
duly
qualified
 
<EOS>
The
only
instance
I
ever
heard
of
his
sagacity
,
was
his
deserting
his
former
patron
,
when
he
found
him
declining
in
power
,
and
in
disgrace
with
the
people
.
<EOS>
Without
principle
,
talent
,
or
intelligence
,
he
is
as
ungracious
as
a
hog
,
greedy
as
a
vulture
and
thievish
as
a
jackdaw
;
but
,
it
must
be
owned
,
he
is
no
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
He
pretends
to
no
virtue
,
and
takes
no
pains
to
disguise
his
character
 
<EOS>
His
ministry
will
be
attended
with
one
advantage
,
no
man
will
be
disappointed
by
his
breach
of
promise
,
as
no
mortal
ever
trusted
to
his
word
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
lord
#
#
#
#
first
discovered
this
happy
genius
,
and
for
what
purpose
lord
 
has
now
adopted
him
:
but
one
would
think
,
that
as
amber
has
a
power
to
attract
dirt
,
and
straws
,
and
chaff
,
a
minister
is
endued
with
the
same
kind
of
faculty
,
to
lick
up
every
knave
and
blockhead
in
his
way
 
<EOS>
"
His
eulogium
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
old
duke
of
N
#
#
#
#
;
who
,
squeezing
into
the
circle
with
a
busy
face
of
importance
,
trust
his
head
into
every
countenance
,
as
if
he
had
been
in
search
of
some
body
,
to
whom
he
wanted
to
impart
something
of
great
consequence
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
had
been
formerly
known
to
him
,
bowed
as
he
passed
,
and
the
duke
,
seeing
himself
saluted
so
respectfully
by
a
well
-
dressed
person
,
was
not
slow
in
returning
the
curtesy
 
<EOS>
He
even
came
up
,
and
,
and
taking
him
cordially
by
the
hand
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
Mr
A
#
#
#
#
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
you
 
<EOS>
How
long
have
you
been
come
from
abroad
?
  
<EOS>
How
did
you
leave
our
good
friends
,
the
Dutch
?
<EOS>
The
king
of
Prussia
do
n't
think
of
another
war
,
ah
?
  
<EOS>
He
's
a
great
king
!
<EOS>
a
great
conqueror
!
<EOS>
a
very
great
conqueror

<EOS>
Your
Alexanders
and
Hannibals
were
nothing
at
all
to
him
,
Sir####Corporals

<EOS>
drummers
!
<EOS>
dross
!
<EOS>
mere
trash
 
<EOS>
Damned
trash
,
heh
?
 
<EOS>
"
 
His
grace
being
by
this
time
out
of
breath
,
my
uncle
took
the
opportunity
to
tell
him
he
had
not
been
out
of
England
,
that
his
name
was
Bramble
,
and
that
he
had
the
honour
to
sit
in
the
last
parliament
but
one
of
the
late
king
,
as
representative
for
the
borough
of
Dymkymraig
.
"
<EOS>
Odso
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
duke
)
<EOS>
I
remember
you
perfectly
well
,
my
dear
Mr
Bramble
 
<EOS>
You
was
always
a
good
and
loyal
subject
 
a
staunch
friend
to
administration
  
<EOS>
I
made
your
brother
an
Irish
bishop
 
<EOS>
Pardon
me
,
my
lord
,
(
said
the
"
squire
)
<EOS>
I
,
once
had
a
brother
,
but
he
was
a
captain
in
the
army
 
<EOS>
"
"
Ha
!
said
his
grace
)
<EOS>
he
was
so
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
3But
<EOS>
who
was
the
bishop
then
?
<EOS>
Bishop
<EOS>
Blackberry
 
<EOS>
Sure
it
was
Bishop
Blackberry
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
relation
of
yours
 
"
"
Very
likely
,
my
lord
(
replied
my
uncle
)
;
the
Blackberry
is
the
fruit
of
the
Bramble
 
<EOS>
But
,
I
believe
,
the
Bishop
is
not
a
berry
of
our
bush
 
<EOS>
"
"
No
more
he
is
 
No
more
he
is
,
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
duke
)
<EOS>
there
you
gave
me
a
scratch
,
<EOS>
good
Mr
Bramble
,
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
 
<EOS>
Well
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
at
Lincoln's
-
inn
-
fields
  
<EOS>
You
know
the
way
 
Times
are
altered
.
<EOS>
Though
I
have
lost
the
power
,
I
retain
the
inclination
 
<EOS>
Your
very
humble
servant
,
good
Mr
Blackberry
 
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
shoved
to
another
corner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
fine
old
gentleman
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Mr
Barton
)
<EOS>
what
spirits
!
<EOS>
what
a
memory
!
  
<EOS>
He
never
forgets
an
old
friend
.
"
<EOS>
"
He
does
me
too
much
honour
,
(
observed
our
"
squire
)
to
rank
me
among
the
number
 
<EOS>
Whilst
I
sat
in
parliament
,
I
never
voted
with
the
ministry
but
<EOS>
three
times
,
when
my
conscience
told
me
they
were
in
the
right
:
however
,
if
he
still
keeps
levee
,
I
will
carry
my
nephew
thither
,
that
he
may
see
,
and
learn
to
avoid
the
scene
;
for
,
I
think
,
an
English
gentleman
never
appears
to
such
disadvantage
,
as
at
the
levee
of
a
minister
 
<EOS>
Of
his
grace
I
shall
say
nothing
at
present
,
but
that
for
thirty
years
he
was
the
constant
and
common
but
of
ridicule
and
execration
.
<EOS>
He
was
generally
laughed
at
as
an
ape
in
politics
,
whose
office
and
influence
served
only
to
render
his
folly
the
more
notorious
;
and
the
opposition
cursed
him
,
as
the
indefatigable
drudge
of
a
first
-
mover
,
who
was
justly
stiled
and
stigmatized
as
the
father
of
corruption
:
but
this
ridiculous
ape
,
this
venal
drudge
,
no
sooner
lost
the
places
he
was
so
ill
qualified
to
fill
,
and
unfurled
the
banners
of
faction
,
than
he
was
metamorphosed
into
a
pattern
of
public
virtue
;
the
very
people
who
reviled
him
before
,
now
extolled
him
to
the
skies
,
as
a
wise
,
experienced
statesman
,
chief
pillar
of
the
Protestant
succession
,
and
corner
stone
of
English
liberty
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
how
Mr
Barton
reconciles
these
contradictions
,
without
obliging
us
to
resign
all
title
to
the
privilege
of
common
sense
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sir
,
(
answered
Barton
)
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
justify
the
extravagations
of
the
multitude
;
who
,
I
suppose
,
were
as
wild
in
their
former
censure
,
as
in
their
present
praise
:
but
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
attend
you
on
Thursday
next
to
his
grace
's
levee
;
<EOS>
where
,
I
'm
afraid
<EOS>
,
we
shall
not
be
crowded
with
company
;
for
,
yon
know
,
there
's
a
wide
difference
between
his
present
office
of
president
of
the
council
,
and
his
former
post
of
first
lord
commissioner
of
the
treasury
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
communicative
friend
having
announced
all
the
remarkable
characters
of
both
sexes
,
that
appeared
at
court
,
we
resolved
to
adjourn
,
and
retired
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
stair
-
case
,
there
was
a
crowd
of
lacqueys
and
chairmen
,
and
in
the
midst
of
them
stood
Humphry
Clinker
,
exalted
upon
a
stool
,
with
his
hat
in
one
,
hand
and
a
paper
in
the
other
,
in
the
act
of
holding
forth
to
the
people
 
Before
we
could
inquire
into
the
meaning
of
this
exhibition
<EOS>
,
he
perceived
his
master
,
thrust
the
paper
into
his
pocket
,
descended
from
his
elevation
,
bolted
through
the
crowd
,
and
brought
up
the
carriage
to
the
gate
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
said
nothing
till
we
were
seated
,
when
after
having
looked
at
me
earnestly
for
some
time
,
he
burst
out
a
-
laughing
,
and
asked
if
I
knew
upon
what
subject
Glinker
was
holding
forth
to
the
mob
?
  
<EOS>
"
If
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
the
fellow
is
turned
mountebank
,
I
must
turn
him
out
of
my
service
,
otherwise
he
'll
make
Merry
Andrews
of
us
all
 
<EOS>
"
I
observed
that
,
in
all
probability
,
he
had
studied
medicine
under
his
master
,
who
was
a
farrier
.
     
<EOS>
At
dinner
,
the
"
squire
asked
him
,
if
he
had
ever
practised
physic
?
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
an
please
your
honour
,
(
said
he
)
among
brute
beasts
;
but
I
never
meddle
with
rational
creatures
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
whether
you
rank
in
that
class
<EOS>
the
audience
you
was
haranguing
in
the
court
at
St.
James
's
,
<EOS>
but
I
should
be
glad
to
know
what
kind
of
powders
you
was
distributing
;
and
whether
you
had
a
good
sale
  
"
Sale
,
sir
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Clinker
)
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
never
be
base
enough
to
sell
for
gold
and
silver
,
what
freely
comes
of
God
's
grace
.
<EOS>
I
distributed
nothing
,
an
like
your
honour
,
but
a
word
of
advice
to
my
fellows
in
servitude
and
sin
.
"
<EOS>
"
Advice
concerning
what
?
"
<EOS>
"
Concerning
profane
swearing
,
an
please
your
honour
;
so
horrid
and
shocking
,
that
it
made
my
hair
stand
on
end
.
"
"
Nay
,
if
thou
can'st
cure
them
of
that
disease
,
I
shall
think
thee
a
wonderful
doctor
indeed
 
"
"
Why
not
cure
them
,
my
good
master
?
<EOS>
the
hearts
of
those
poor
people
are
not
so
stubborn
as
your
honour
seems
to
think
 
<EOS>
Make
them
first
sensible
that
you
have
nothing
in
view
but
their
good
,
then
they
will
listen
with
patience
,
and
easily
be
convinced
of
the
sin
and
folly
of
a
practice
that
affords
neither
profit
nor
pleasure
 
<EOS>
"
At
this
remark
,
our
uncle
changed
colour
,
and
looked
round
the
company
,
conscious
that
his
own
withers
were
not
altogether
unwrung
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
Clinker
,
(
said
he
)
if
you
should
have
eloquence
enough
to
persuade
the
vulgar
,
to
resign
those
tropes
and
figures
of
rhetoric
,
there
will
be
little
or
nothing
left
to
distinguish
their
conversation
from
that
of
their
betters
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
then
your
honour
knows
,
their
conversation
will
be
void
of
offence
;
and
,
at
the
day
of
judgment
,
there
will
be
no
distinction
of
persons

Humphry
gowing
down
stairs
to
fetch
up
a
bottle
of
wine
,
my
uncle
congratulated
his
sister
upon
having
such
a
reformer
in
the
family
;
when
Mrs
Tabitha
declared
,
he
was
a
sober
civilized
fellow
,
very
respectful
,
and
very
industrious
;
and
,
she
believed
,
a
good
Christian
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
One
would
think
,
Clinker
must
really
have
some
very
extraordinary
talent
,
to
ingratiate
himself
in
this
manner
with
a
virago
of
her
character
,
so
fortified
against
him
with
prejudice
and
resentment
;
but
the
truth
is
,
since
the
adventure
of
Salt
-
hill
,
Mrs
Tabby
seems
to
be
entirely
changed
.
<EOS>
She
has
left
off
scolding
the
servants
,
an
exercise
which
was
grown
habitual
and
even
seemed
necessary
to
her
constitution
;
and
is
become
so
indifferent
to
Chowder
,
as
to
part
with
him
in
a
present
to
lady
Griskin
,
who
proposes
to
bring
the
breed
of
him
into
fashion
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
is
the
widow
of
sir
Timothy
Griskin
,
a
distant
relation
of
our
family
.
<EOS>
She
enjoys
a
jointure
of
five
hundred
pounds
a
-
year
,
and
makes
shift
to
spend
three
times
that
sum
.
<EOS>
Her
character
before
marriage
was
a
little
equivocal
;
but
at
present
she
lives
in
the
bon
ton
,
keeps
card
tables
,
gives
private
suppers
to
select
friends
,
and
is
visited
by
persons
of
the
first
fashion
 
<EOS>
She
has
been
remarkably
civil
to
us
all
,
and
cultivates
my
uncle
with
the
most
particular
regard
;
but
the
more
she
strokes
him
,
the
more
his
bristles
seem
to
rise
 
To
her
compliments
he
makes
very
laconic
and
dry
returns
 
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
she
sent
us
a
pottle
of
fine
strawberries
,
which
he
did
not
receive
without
signs
of
disgust
,
muttering
from
the
Aeneid
,
timeo
Danaos
et
Dona
ferentes
.
<EOS>
She
has
twice
called
for
Liddy
,
of
a
forenoon
,
to
take
an
airing
in
the
coach
;
but
Mrs
Tabby
was
always
so
alert
,
(
I
suppose
by
his
direction
)
that
she
never
could
have
the
niece
without
her
aunt
's
company
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
endeavoured
to
sound
Square
-
toes
on
this
subject
;
but
he
carefully
avoids
all
explanation
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
now
,
dear
Phillips
,
filled
a
whole
sheet
;
and
if
you
have
read
it
to
an
end
,
I
dare
say
,
you
are
as
tired
as
    
your
humble

<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
YES
,
Doctor
I
have
seen
the
British
Museum
;
which
is
a
noble
collection
,
and
even
stupendous
,
if
we
consider
it
was
made
by
a
private
man
,
a
physician
,
who
was
obliged
to
make
his
own
fortune
at
the
same
time
:
but
great
as
the
collection
is
,
it
would
appear
more
striking
if
it
was
arranged
in
one
spacious
saloon
,
instead
of
being
divided
into
different
apartments
,
which
it
does
not
entirely
fill
 
<EOS>
I
could
wish
the
series
of
medals
was
connected
,
and
the
whole
of
the
animal
,
vegetable
,
and
mineral
kingdoms
completed
,
by
adding
to
each
at
the
public
expence
,
those
articles
that
are
wanting
.
<EOS>
It
would
likewise
be
a
great
improvement
.
<EOS>
with
respect
to
the
library
,
if
the
deficiencies
were
made
up
,
by
purchasing
all
the
books
of
character
that
are
not
to
be
found
already
in
the
collection
 
<EOS>
They
might
be
classed
in
centuries
,
according
to
the
dates
of
their
publication
,
and
catalogues
printed
of
them
and
the
manuscripts
,
for
the
information
of
those
that
want
to
consult
,
or
compile
from
such
authorities
.
<EOS>
I
could
also
wish
for
the
honour
of
the
nation
,
that
there
was
a
complete
apparatus
for
a
course
of
mathematics
,
mechanics
,
and
experimental
philosophy
;
and
a
good
salary
settled
upon
an
able
professor
,
who
should
give
regular
lectures
on
these
subjects
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
is
all
idle
speculation
,
which
will
never
be
reduced
to
practice
 
<EOS>
Considering
the
temper
of
the
times
,
it
is
a
wonder
to
see
any
institution
whatsoever
established
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
public
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
party
is
risen
to
a
kind
of
phrenzy
,
unknown
to
former
ages
,
or
rather
degenerated
to
a
total
extinction
of
honesty
and
candour
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
observed
,
for
some
time
,
that
the
public
papers
are
become
the
infamous
vehicles
of
the
most
cruel
and
perfidious
defamation
:
<EOS>
every
rancorous
knave
 
<EOS>
every
desperate
incendiary
,
that
can
afford
to
spend
half
a
crown
or
three
shillings
,
<EOS>
may
skulk
behind
the
press
of
a
news
-
monger
,
and
have
a
stab
at
the
first
character
in
the
kingdom
,
without
running
the
least
hazard
of
detection
,
or
punishment
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
made
acquaintance
with
a
Mr
Barton
,
whom
Jery
knew
at
Oxford
;
a
good
sort
of
a
man
,
though
most
ridiculously
warped
in
his
political
principles
;
but
his
partiality
is
the
less
offensive
,
as
it
never
appears
in
the
stile
of
scurrility
and
abuse
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
member
of
parliament
,
and
a
retainer
to
the
court
;
and
his
whole
conversation
turns
upon
the
virtues
and
perfections
of
the
ministers
,
who
are
his
patrons
.
<EOS>
T'other
day
,
when
he
was
bedaubing
one
of
those
worthies
,
with
the
most
fulsome
praise
,
I
told
him
I
had
seen
the
same
nobleman
characterised
very
differently
,
in
one
of
the
daily
-
papers
;
indeed
,
so
stigmatized
,
that
if
one
half
of
what
was
said
of
him
was
true
,
he
must
be
not
only
unfit
to
rule
,
but
even
unfit
to
live
:
that
those
impeachments
had
been
repeated
again
and
again
,
with
the
addition
of
fresh
matter
;
and
that
as
he
had
taken
no
steps
towards
his
own
vindication
,
I
began
to
think
there
was
some
foundation
for
the
charge
.
"
<EOS>
And
pray
,
sir
,
(
said
Mr
Barton
)
<EOS>
what
steps
would
you
have
him
take
?
  
<EOS>
Suppose
he
should
prosecute
the
publisher
,
who
screens
the
anonymous
accuser
,
and
bring
him
to
the
pillory
for
a
libel
;
this
is
so
far
from
being
counted
a
punishment
,
in
terrorem
,
that
it
will
probably
make
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
multitude
immediately
take
him
into
their
protection
,
as
a
martyr
to
the
cause
of
defamation
,
which
they
have
always
espoused
 
<EOS>
They
pay
his
fine
,
they
contribute
to
the
increase
of
his
stock
,
his
shop
his
crowded
with
customers
and
the
sale
of
his
paper
<EOS>
rises
in
proportion
to
the
scandal
it
contains
.
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
prosecutor
is
inveighed
against
as
a
tyrant
and
oppressor
,
for
having
chosen
to
proceed
by
the
way
of
information
,
which
is
deemed
a
grievance
;
but
if
he
lays
an
action
for
damages
,
he
must
prove
the
damage
,
and
I
leave
you
to
judge
,
whether
a
gentleman
's
character
may
not
be
brought
into
contempt
,
and
all
his
views
in
life
blasted
by
calumny
,
without
his
being
able
to
specify
the
particulars
of
the
damage
he
has
sustained
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
The
spirit
of
defamation
is
a
kind
of
heresy
,
that
thrives
under
persecution
.
<EOS>
The
liberty
of
the
press
is
a
term
of
great
efficacy
;
and
,
like
that
of
the
Protestant
religion
,
has
often
served
the
purposes
of
sedition
 
<EOS>
A
minister
,
therefore
,
must
arm
himself
with
patience
,
and
bear
those
attacks
without
repining
 
Whatever
mischief
they
may
do
in
other
respects
,
the
certainly
contribute
in
one
particular
,
to
the
advantage
of
government
;
for
those
defamotory
articles
have
multiplied
papers
in
such
a
manner
,
and
augmented
their
sale
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
duty
upon
stamps
and
advert
sements
has
made
a
very
considerable
addition
to
the
revenue
.
<EOS>
"
Certain
it
is
,
a
gentleman
's
honour
is
a
very
delicate
subject
to
be
handled
by
a
jury
,
composed
of
men
,
who
can
not
be
supposed
remarkable
either
for
sentiment
or
impartiality
  
<EOS>
In
such
a
case
,
indeed
,
the
defendant
is
tried
,
not
only
by
his
peers
but
also
by
his
party
;
and
I
really
think
,
that
,
of
all
patriots
,
he
is
the
most
resolute
who
exposes
himself
to
such
detraction
,
for
the
sake
of
his
country
 
<EOS>
If
,
from
the
ignorance
or
partiality
of
juries
,
a
gentleman
can
have
no
redress
from
law
,
for
being
defamed
in
a
pamphlet
or
news
-
paper
,
I
know
<EOS>
but
one
other
method
of
proceeding
against
the
publisher
,
which
is
attended
with
some
risque
,
but
has
been
practised
successfully
,
more
than
once
,
in
my
remembrance
 
<EOS>
A
regiment
of
horse
was
represented
,
in
one
of
the
news
-
papers
,
as
having
misbehaved
at
Dettingen
;
a
captain
of
that
regiment
broke
the
publisher
's
bones
telling
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
if
he
went
to
law
,
he
should
certainly
have
the
like
salutation
from
every
officer
of
the
corps
.
<EOS>
Governor
#
#
#
#
took
the
same
satisfaction
on
the
ribs
of
an
author
,
who
traduced
him
by
name
in
a
periodical
paper
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
a
low
fellow
of
the
same
class
,
who
,
being
turned
out
of
Venice
for
his
impudence
and
scurrility
,
retired
to
Lugano
,
a
town
of
the
Grisons
,
(
a
free
people
,
God
wot
)
where
he
found
a
printing
press
,
from
whence
he
squirted
his
filth
at
some
respectable
characters
in
the
republic
,
which
he
had
been
obliged
to
abandon
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
,
finding
him
out
of
the
reach
of
legal
chastisement
,
employed
certain
useful
instruments
,
such
as
may
be
found
in
all
countries
,
to
give
him
the
bastinado
;
which
,
being
repeated
more
than
once
,
effectually
stopt
the
current
of
his
abuse
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
like
every
other
privilege
,
it
must
be
restrained
within
certain
bounds
;
for
if
it
is
carried
to
a
breach
of
law
,
religion
,
and
charity
,
it
becomes
one
of
the
greatest
evils
that
ever
annoyed
the
community
.
<EOS>
If
the
lowest
ruffian
may
stab
your
good
name
with
impunity
in
England
,
will
you
be
so
uncandid
as
to
exclaim
against
Italy
for
the
practice
of
common
assassination
?
<EOS>
To
what
purpose
is
our
property
secured
,
if
our
moral
character
is
left
defencless
?
<EOS>
People
thus
bated
,
grow
desperate
;
and
the
despair
of
being
able
to
preserve
one
's
character
,
untainted
by
such
vermin
,
produces
a
total
neglect
of
same
;
so
that
one
of
the
chief
incitements
to
the
practice
of
virtue
is
effectually
destroyed
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Barton
's
last
consideration
,
respecting
the
stamp
duty
,
is
equally
wise
and
laudable
with
another
maxim
which
has
been
long
adopted
by
our
financiers
,
namely
,
to
connive
at
drunkenness
,
riot
,
and
dissipation
,
because
they
inhance
the
receipt
of
the
excise
;
not
reflecting
,
that
in
providing
this
temporary
convenience
,
they
are
destroying
the
morals
,
health
,
and
industry
of
the
people
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
my
contempt
for
those
who
flatter
a
minister
,
I
think
there
is
something
still
more
despicable
in
flattering
a
mob
.
<EOS>
When
I
see
a
man
of
birth
,
education
,
and
fortune
,
put
himself
on
a
level
with
the
dregs
of
the
people
,
mingle
with
low
mechanics
,
feed
with
them
at
the
same
board
,
and
drink
with
them
in
the
same
cup
,
flatter
their
prejudices
,
harangue
in
praise
of
their
virtues
,
expose
themselves
to
the
belchings
of
their
beer
,
the
fumes
of
their
tobacco
,
the
grossness
of
their
familiarity
,
and
the
impertinence
of
their
conversation
,
I
can
not
help
despising
him
,
as
a
man
guilty
of
the
vilest
prostitution
,
in
order
to
effect
a
purpose
equally
selfish
and
illiberal
.
    
<EOS>
I
should
renounce
politics
the
more
willingly
,
if
I
could
find
other
topics
of
conversation
,
discussed
with
more
modesty
and
candour
;
but
the
daemon
of
party
seems
to
have
usurped
every
department
of
life
.
<EOS>
Even
the
world
of
literature
and
taste
is
divided
into
the
most
virulent
factions
,
which
revile
,
decry
,
and
traduce
the
works
of
one
another
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
I
went
to
return
an
afternoon
's
visit
to
a
gentleman
of
my
acquaintance
,
at
whose
house
I
found
one
of
the
authors
of
the
present
age
,
who
has
written
with
some
success
 
<EOS>
As
I
had
read
one
or
two
of
his
performances
,
which
gave
me
pleasure
,
I
was
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
know
his
person
;
but
his
discourse
,
and
deportment
destroyed
all
the
impressions
which
his
writings
had
made
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
took
upon
him
to
decide
dogmatically
upon
every
subject
,
without
deigning
to
shew
the
least
cause
for
his
differing
from
the
general
opinions
of
mankind
,
as
if
it
had
been
our
duty
to
acquiesce
in
the
ipse
dixit
of
this
new
Pythagoras
.
<EOS>
He
rejudged
the
characters
of
all
the
principal
authors
,
who
had
died
within
a
century
of
the
present
time
;
and
,
in
this
revision
,
paid
no
sort
of
regard
to
the
reputation
they
had
acquired
 
Milton
was
harsh
and
prosaic
;
Dryden
,
languid
and
verbose
;
Butler
and
Swift
,
without
humour
;
Congreve
,
without
wit
;
and
Pope
destitute
of
any
sort
of
poetical
merit
 
<EOS>
As
for
his
cotemporaries
,
he
could
not
bear
to
hear
one
of
them
mentioned
with
any
degree
of
applause
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
dunces
,
pedants
,
plagiaries
,
quacks
,
and
impostors
;
and
you
could
not
name
a
single
performance
,
but
what
was
tame
,
stupid
,
and
insipid
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
that
this
writer
had
nothing
to
charge
his
conscience
with
,
on
the
side
of
flattery
;
for
,
I
understand
,
he
was
never
known
to
praise
one
line
that
was
written
,
even
by
those
with
whom
he
lived
on
terms
of
good
fellowship
.
<EOS>
This
arrogance
and
presumption
,
in
depreciating
authors
,
for
whose
reputation
the
company
may
be
interested
,
is
such
an
insult
upon
the
understanding
,
as
I
could
not
bear
without
wincing
.
    
<EOS>
I
desired
to
know
his
reasons
for
decrying
some
works
,
which
had
afforded
me
uncommon
pleasure
;
and
,
as
demonstration
did
not
seem
to
be
his
talent
,
I
dissented
from
his
opinion
with
great
freedom
.
<EOS>
Having
been
spoiled
by
the
deference
and
humility
of
his
hearers
,
he
did
not
bear
contradiction
with
much
temper
;
and
the
dispute
might
have
grown
warm
,
had
it
not
been
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
rival
bard
,
at
whose
appearance
he
always
quits
the
place
 
They
are
of
different
cabals
,
and
have
been
at
open
war
these
twenty
years
 
<EOS>
If
the
other
was
dogmatical
,
this
genius
was
declamatory
:
he
did
not
discourse
,
but
harangue
;
and
his
orations
were
equally
tedious
and
turgid
.
<EOS>
He
too
pronounces
ex
cathedra
upon
the
characters
of
his
cotemporaries
;
and
though
he
scruples
not
to
deal
out
praise
,
even
lavishly
,
to
the
lowest
reptile
in
Grub
-
street
who
will
either
flatter
him
in
private
,
or
mount
the
public
rostrum
as
his
panegyrist
,
he
damns
all
the
other
writers
of
the
age
,
with
the
utmost
insolence
and
rancour
 
<EOS>
One
is
a
blunderbuss
as
being
a
native
of
Ireland
;
another
,
a
half
-
starved
louse
of
literature
,
from
the
banks
of
the
Tweed
;
a
third
,
an
ass
,
because
he
enjoys
a
pension
from
the
government
;
a
fourth
,
the
very
angel
of
dulness
;
because
he
succeeded
in
a
species
of
writing
in
which
this
Aristarchus
had
sailed
;
a
fifth
,
who
presumed
to
make
strictures
upon
one
of
his
performances
,
he
holds
as
a
bug
in
criticism
,
whose
stench
is
more
offensive
than
his
sting
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
except
himself
and
his
myrmidons
,
there
is
not
a
man
of
genius
or
learning
in
the
three
kingdoms
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
success
of
those
,
who
have
written
without
the
pale
of
this
confederacy
,
he
imputes
it
entirely
to
want
of
taste
in
the
public
;
not
considering
,
that
to
the
approbation
of
that
very
tasteless
public
,
he
himself
owes
all
the
consequence
he
has
in
life
.
    
<EOS>
Those
originals
are
not
fit
for
conversation
.
<EOS>
If
they
would
maintain
the
advantage
they
have
gained
by
their
writing
,
they
should
never
appear
but
upon
paper
 
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
am
shocked
to
find
a
man
have
sublime
ideas
in
his
head
,
and
nothing
but
illiberal
sentiments
in
his
heart
 
<EOS>
The
human
soul
will
be
generally
found
most
defective
in
the
article
of
candour
 
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
,
no
mind
was
ever
wholly
exempt
from
envy
;
which
,
perhaps
,
may
have
been
implanted
,
as
an
instinct
essential
to
our
nature
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
we
sometimes
palliate
this
vice
,
under
the
specious
name
of
emulation
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
a
person
remarkably
generous
,
humane
,
moderate
,
and
apparently
self
-
denying
,
who
could
not
hear
even
a
friend
commended
,
without
betraying
marks
of
uneasiness
;
as
if
that
commendation
had
implied
an
odious
comparison
to
his
prejudice
,
and
every
wreath
of
praise
added
to
the
other
's
character
,
was
a
garland
plucked
from
his
own
temples
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
malignant
species
of
jealousy
,
of
which
I
stand
acquitted
in
my
own
conscience
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
is
a
vice
,
or
an
infirmity
,
I
leave
you
to
inquire
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
another
point
,
which
I
would
much
rather
see
determined
;
whether
the
world
was
always
as
contemptible
,
as
it
appears
to
me
at
present
?
  
<EOS>
If
the
morals
of
mankind
have
not
contracted
an
extaraordinary
degree
of
depravity
,
within
these
thirty
years
,
then
must
I
be
infected
with
the
common
vice
of
old
men
,
difficilis
,
querulus
,
laudatur
temporis
acti
;
or
,
which
is
more
probable
,
the
impetuous
pursuits
and
avocations
of
youth
have
formerly
hindered
me
from
observing
those
rotten
parts
of
human
nature
,
which
now
appear
so
offensively
to
my
observation
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
been
at
court
,
and
change
,
and
every
where
;
and
every
where
we
find
food
for
spleen
,
and
subject
for
ridicule
 
<EOS>
My
new
servant
,
Humphry
Clinker
,
turns
out
a
great
original
;
and
Tabby
is
a
changed
creature
 
She
has
parted
with
Chowder
;
and
does
nothing
but
smile
,
like
Malvolio
in
the
play
 
<EOS>
I
'll
be
hanged
if
she
is
not
acting
a
part
which
is
not
natural
to
her
disposition
,
for
some
purpose
which
I
have
not
yet
discovered
.
    
<EOS>
With
respect
to
the
characters
of
mankind
,
my
curiosity
is
quite
satisfied
:
I
have
done
with
the
science
of
men
,
and
must
now
endeavour
to
amuse
myself
with
the
novelty
of
things
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
at
present
,
by
a
violent
effort
of
the
mind
,
forced
from
my
natural
bias
;
but
this
power
ceasing
to
act
,
I
shall
return
to
my
solitude
with
redoubled
velocity
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
I
see
,
and
hear
,
and
feel
,
in
this
great
reservoir
of
folly
,
knavery
,
and
sophistication
,
coutributes
to
inhance
the
value
of
a
country
life
,
in
the
sentiments
of
    
yours
always

Mr

having

me
a

I

I

he
went
away
in

at

warning

<EOS>
He
and
Chowder
could
not
agree
,
and
so
they
fitt
upon
the

,
and
Chowder
bitt
his
thumb
,
and
he
swore
he
would
do
him
a
mischief
,
and
he
spoke
saucy
to
mistress
,
whereby
the
"
squire
turn'd
him
off
in
gudgeon
;
and
by
God
's
providence
we
picked
up
another
footman
called
Umphry
Klinker
;
a
good
sole
as
ever
broke
bread

which
shews
that
a
scalded
cat
may
prove
a
good
mouser
,
and
a

be
staunch

thof
he
has
got

O

<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
of
London
?
<EOS>
All
the
towns
that
ever
I
beheld
in
my
born

days
,
are
no
more
than
Welsh
barrows
and
crumblecks
to
this
wonderful
sitty
!
<EOS>
Even
Bath
itself
is
put
a
fillitch
,
in

naam
of
God
 
One
would
think
there
's
no
end
of
the
streets
,
but
the
land
's
end
<EOS>
,
Then
there
's
such
a
power
of
people
,
going
hurry
skurry

<EOS>
Such
a
racket
of
coxes
!
<EOS>
Such

<EOS>
So
many
strangers

!
<EOS>
O
gracious
!
<EOS>
my
poor
Welsh
brain
has
been
spinning
like
a
top
ever
since
I
came
hither
!
<EOS>
And
I
have
seen
the
Park
,
and
the
paleass
of
Saint
Gimses
,
and
the
king
's
and
the
queen
's
magisterial
pursing
,
and
the
sweet
young
princes
,
and
the
hillyfents

and
all
the
rest
of
the
royal

<EOS>
Last
week
I
went
with
mistress
to
the
Tower
,
to
see
the
crowns
and
wild
beastis
;
and
there
was
a
monstracious
lion
,
which
teeth
half
a
quarter
long
;
and
a
gentleman
bid
me
not
to
go
near
him
,
if
I
was
n't
a
maid
;
being
as
how
he
would
roar
,
and
tear
,
and
play
the
dickens
 
<EOS>
Now
I
had
no
mind
to
go
near
him
;
for
I
can
not
abide
such
dangerous
honeymils
,
not
I
 
<EOS>
but
,
mistress
would
go
;
and
the
beast
kept
such
a
roaring
and
bouncing
,
that
I
tho't
he
would
have
broke
his
cage
and
devoured
us
all
;
and
the
gentleman
titered
forsooth
;
but
I
'll
go
to
death
upon
it
,
I
will
,
that
my
lady
is
as
good
,
a
sirchin
,
as
the
child
unborn
;
and
,
therefore
,
either
the
gentleman
told
a
sib
,
or
the
lion
oft
to
be
set
in
the
stocks
for
bearing
false
witness
again
his
neighbour
;
for
the
commandment
sayeth
,
Thou
shalt
not
bear
false
witness
against
thy
neighbour
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
afterwards
of
a
party
at
Sadler
's
wells
,
where
I
saw
such
tumbling
and
dancing
upon
ropes
and
wires
,
that
I
was
frightened
,
and
ready
to
go
into
a
fit
 
<EOS>
I
tho't
<EOS>
it
was
all
inchantment

and
,
believing
myself
bewitched

began
for
to
cry
 
<EOS>
You
knows
as
how
the
witches
in
Wales
fly

sticks

but
here
was
flying

firing

blowing

swinging

rolling
of
wheel
barrows
upon
a

(
God

<EOS>
no
thicker

a

they
must

A
fine
gentleman

with
a
pig's

tail

and
a
golden
ford
by
his
side

came
to
com

fit

and
offered
for
to
treat
me
with
a
pint
of
wind

but
I
would
not
stay

and
<EOS>
so
,
in
going
through
the
dark
passage
,
he
began
to
shew
his
cloven
futt
,
and
went
for
to
be
rude
;
my
fellow

Umphry
Klinker

bid
him
be
sivil

and
he
gave
the

a

I
sackens

Mr
Klinker
wa'n't
long

<EOS>
With
a
good
oaken
sapling
he
dusted
his

for
all
his
golden

and
,
sipping
me
under
his

carried
me

DEAR
WAT
,
I
MENTIONED
in
my
last
,
my
uncle
's
design
of
going
to
the
duke
of
N
#
#
#
#
's
levee
;
which
design
has
been
executed
accordingly
.
<EOS>
His
grace
has
been
so
long
accustomed
to
this
kind
of
homage
,
that
though
the
place
he
now
fills
does
not
imply
the
tenth
part
of
the
influence
,
which
he
exerted
in
his
former
office
,
he
has
given
his
friends
to
understand
,
that
they
can
not
oblige
him
in
any
thing
more
,
than
in
contributing
to
support
the
shadow
of
that
power
which
he
no
longer
retains
in
substance
;
and
therefore
he
has
still
public
days
,
on
which
they
appear
at
his
levee
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
went
thither
with
Mr
Barton
,
who
,
being
one
of
the
duke
's
adherents
,
undertook
to
be
our
introducer
 
<EOS>
The
room
was
pretty
well
filled
with
people
,
in
a
great
variety
of
dress
;
but
there
was
no
more
than
one
gown
and
cassock
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
was
told
his
grace
had
,
while
he
was
minister
,
preferred
almost
every
individual
that
now
filled
the
bench
of
bishops
in
the
house
of
lords
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
the
gratitude
of
the
clergy
is
like
their
charity
,
which
shuns
the
light
 
<EOS>
Mr
Barton
was
immediately
accosted
by
a
person
,
<EOS>
well
striken
in
years
,
tall
,
and
raw
boned
,
with
a
hooked
nose
,
and
an
arch
leer
,
that
indicated
,
at
least
,
as
much
cunning
as
sagacity
.
<EOS>
Our
conductor
saluted
him
,
by
the
name
of
captain
C
#
#
#
#
,
and
afterwards
informed
us
<EOS>
he
was
a
man
of
shrewd
parts
,
whom
the
government
occasionally
employed
in
secret
services
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
had
the
history
of
him
more
at
large
,
from
another
quarter
 
He
had
been
,
many
years
ago
,
concerned
in
fraudulent
practices
,
as
a
merchant
in
France
;
and
being
convicted
of
some
of
them
was
sent
to
the
gallies
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
was
delivered
by
the
interest
of
the
late
duke
of
Ormond
,
to
whom
he
had
recommended
himself
in
a
letter
,
as
his
name
-
sake
and
relation
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
in
the
sequel
employed
by
our
ministry
as
a
spy
;
and
in
the
war
of
1740
,
traversed
all
Spain
,
as
well
as
France
,
in
the
disguise
of
a
capuchin
,
at
the
extreme
hazard
of
his
life
,
in
as
much
as
the
court
of
Madrid
had
actually
got
scent
of
him
,
and
given
orders
to
apprehend
him
at
St.
Sebastian
's
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
had
fortunately
retired
but
a
few
hours
before
the
order
arrived
.
<EOS>
This
and
other
hair
-
breadth
"
scapes
he
pleaded
so
effectually
as
a
merit
with
the
English
ministry
,
that
they
allowed
him
a
comfortable
pension
,
which
he
now
enjoys
in
his
old
age
 
<EOS>
He
has
still
access
to
all
the
ministers
<EOS>
,
ard
is
said
to
be
consulted
by
them
on
many
subjects
,
as
a
man
of
uncommon
understanding
and
great
experience
 
<EOS>
He
is
,
in
fact
,
a
fellow
of
some
parts
,
and
invincible
assurance
;
and
,
in
his
discourse
,
he
assumes
such
an
air
of
self
-
sufficiency
,
as
may
very
well
impose
upon
some
of
the
shallow
politicians
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
not
at
the
helm
of
the
administration
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
is
not
belied
,
this
,
is
not
the
only
imposture
of
which
he
is
guilty
 
<EOS>
They
say
,
he
is
at
bottom
not
only
a
Roman
-
catholic
,
but
really
a
priest
;
<EOS>
and
while
he
pretends
to
disclose
to
our
state
-
pilots
all
the
springs
that
move
the
cabinet
of
Versailles
,
he
is
actually
picking
up
intelligence
for
the
service
of
the
French
minister
 
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
captain
C
#
#
#
#
entered
into
conversation
with
us
in
the
most
familiar
manner
,
and
treated
the
duke
's
character
without
any
ceremony
 
"
This
wife
-
acre
(
said
he
)
is
still
a
-
bed
;
and
I
think
,
the
best
thing
he
can
do
,
is
to
sleep
on
till
Christmas
;
for
,
when
he
gets
up
,
he
does
nothing
but
expose
his
own
folly
.
  
<EOS>
Since
Granville
was
turned
out
,
there
has
been
no
minister
in
this
nation
worth
the
meal
that
whitened
his
periwig
 
<EOS>
They
are
so
ignorant
,
they
scarce
know
a
crab
from
a
cauliflower
:
<EOS>
and
then
they
are
such
dunces
<EOS>
,
that
,
there
's
no
making
them
comprehend
the
plainest
proposition
 
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
the
war
,
this
poor
half
-
witted
creature
told
me
,
in
a
great
fright
that
thirty
thousand
French
had
marched
from
Acadie
to
Cape
Breton
"
 
"
Where
did
they
find
transports
?
"
<EOS>
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
"
Transports
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
they
marched
by
land
 
"
"
By
land
to
the
island
of
Cape
Breton
?
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
is
Cape
Breton
an
island
?
"
<EOS>
Certainly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
are
you
sure
of
that
?
<EOS>
"
When
I
pointed
it
out
in
the
map
he
examined
it
earnestly
with
his
spectacles
;
then
,
taking
me
in
his
arms
,
"
My
dear
C
#
#
#
#
!
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
you
always
bring
us
good
news
 
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
directly
,
and
tell
the
king
that
Cape
Breton
is
an
island
 
"
    
<EOS>
He
seemed
disposed
to
entertain
us
with
more
anecdotes
of
this
nature
,
at
the
expence
of
his
grace
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
Algerine
ambassador
;
a
venerable
Turk
,
with
a
long
white
beard
,
attended
by
his
dragoman
,
or
interpreter
,
and
another
officer
of
his
household
,
who
had
got
no
stockings
to
his
legs
 
Captain
C
#
#
#
#
immediately
spoke
with
an
air
of
authority
to
a
servant
in
waiting
,
bidding
him
go
and
tell
the
duke
to
rise
,
as
there
was
a
great
deal
of
company
come
,
and
,
among
others
,
the
ambassador
from
Algiers
  
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
us
,
"
This
poor
Turk
(
said
he
)
notwithstanding
his
grey
beard
,
is
a
greenhorn
  
<EOS>
He
has
been
several
years
resident
in
London
,
and
is
still
ignorant
of
our
political
revolutions
.
<EOS>
This
visit
is
intended
for
the
prime
minister
of
England
;
but
you
'll
see
how
this
wife
duke
will
receive
it
as
a
mark
of
attachment
to
his
own
person
 
<EOS>
"
Certain
it
is
,
the
duke
seemed
eager
to
acknowledge
the
complement
 
A
door
opening
,
he
suddenly
bolted
out
,
with
a
shaving
cloth
under
his
chin
,
his
face
frothed
up
to
the
eyes
with
soap
lather
;
and
running
up
to
the
ambassador
,
grinned
hideous
in
his
face
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mahomet
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
God
love
your
long
beard
<EOS>
,
I
hope
the
dey
will
make
you
a
horsetail
at
the
next
promotion
,
ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
  
<EOS>
Have
but
a
moment
's
patience
,
and
I
'll
send
to
you
in
a
twinkling
 
"
<EOS>
So
saying
he
retreated
into
his
den
,
leaving
the
Turk
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
however
,
he
said
something
to
his
interpreter
,
the
meaning
of
which
I
had
great
curiosity
to
know
,
as
he
turned
up
his
eyes
while
he
spoke
,
expressing
astonishment
,
mixed
with
devotion
  
<EOS>
We
were
gratified
by
means
of
the
communicative
captain
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
conversed
with
the
dragoman
as
an
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
Ibrahim
,
the
ambassador
,
who
had
mistaken
his
grace
for
the
minister
's
fool
,
was
no
sooner
undeceived
by
the
interpreter
,
than
he
exclaimed
to
this
effect
 
"
Holy
prophet
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
that
this
nation
prospers
,
seeing
it
is
governed
by
the
counsel
of
idiots
;
a
series
of
men
,
whom
all
good
mussulmen
revere
as
the
organs
of
immediate
inspiration
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ibrahim
was
favoured
with
a
particular
audience
of
short
duration
;
after
which
the
duke
conducted
him
to
the
door
,
and
then
returned
to
diffuse
his
gracious
looks
among
the
crowd
of
his
worshippers
.
    
<EOS>
As
Mr
Barton
advanced
to
present
me
to
his
grace
,
it
was
my
fortune
to
attract
his
notice
,
before
I
was
announced
 
<EOS>
He
forthwith
met
me
more
than
half
way
,
and
,
seizing
me
by
the
hand
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
sir
Francis
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
this
is
so
kind
 
<EOS>
I
vow
to
gad
!
<EOS>
I
am
so
obliged
 
Such
attention
to
a
poor
broken
minister
 
<EOS>
Well
 
Pray
when
does
your
excellency
set
sail
?
  
<EOS>
For
God
's
sake
have
a
care
of
your
health
,
and
eat
stewed
prunes
in
the
passage
 
Next
to
your
own
precious
health
,
pray
,
my
dear
excellency
,
take
care
of
the
five
Nations
 
Our
good
friends
the
Five
Nations
 
<EOS>
The
Toryrories
,
the
Maccolmacks
,
the
Out

the
Crickets
,
and
the
Kickshaws
 
Let'em
have
plenty
of
blankets
,
and
stinkubus

and
wampum
;
and
your
excellency
wo
n't
fail
to
scour
the

and
boil
the

and
bury

<EOS>
Ha
,
ha

"
When
he
had
uttered
this
rhapsody
,
with
his
usual
precipitation
<EOS>
Mr
Barton
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
I
was
neither
Sir
Francis
nor
St.
Francis
;
but
simply
Mr
Melford
,
nephew
to
Mr
Bramble
;
who
,
stepping
forward
,
made
his
bow
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Odso
!
<EOS>
no
more
it
is
Sir
Francis
 
(
said
this
wife
statesman
)
<EOS>
Mr
Melford
,
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
 
<EOS>
I
sent
you
an
engineer
to
fortify
your
dock
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
 
your
servant
Mr
Bramble
 
<EOS>
How
dy'e
,
good
Mr
Bramble
?
<EOS>
Your
nephew
is
a
pretty
young
fellow
 
Faith
and
troth
,
a
very
pretty
fellow
!
  
<EOS>
His
father
is
my
old
friend
 
<EOS>
How
does
he
hold
it
?
<EOS>
Still
troubled
with
that
damned
disorder
,
ha
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
lord
,
(
replied
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
all
his
troubles
are
over
 
<EOS>
He
has
been
dead
these
fifteen
years
.
"
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
how
 
Yes
,
faith
!
<EOS>
now
I
remember
:
he
is
dead
,
sure
enough
 
Well
,
and
how
 
does
the
young
gentleman
stand
for
Haverford
West
?
<EOS>
or
 
a
 
<EOS>
what
dy'e
 
<EOS>
my
dear
Mr
Milfordhaven
,
I
'll
do
you
all
the
service
in
my
power
 
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
some
credit
left
 
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
then
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
I
was
still
a
minor
;
and
that
we
had
no
intention
to
trouble
him
at
present
for
any
favour
whatsoever
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
hither
with
my
nephew
(
added
he
)
to
pay
our
respects
to
your
grace
;
and
I
may
venture
to
say
that
his
views
and
mine
are
at
least
as
disinterested
as
those
of
any
individual
in
this
assembly
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
Mr
Brambleberry
!
<EOS>
you
do
me
infinite
honour
 
<EOS>
I
shall
always
rejoice
to
see
you
and
your
hopeful
nephew
,
Mr
Milfordhaven
 
<EOS>
My
credit
,
such
as
it
is
<EOS>
,
you
may
command
 
<EOS>
I
wish
we
had
more
friends
of
your
kidney
 
"
    
Then
,
turning
to
Captain
C
#
#
#
#
,
"
Ha
,
C
#
#
#
#
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
what
news
,
C
#
#
#
#
?
<EOS>
How
does
the
world
wag
?
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
"
The
world
wags
much
after
the
old
fashion
,
my
lord
(
answered
the
captain
)
:
the
politicians
of
London
and
Westminster
have
begun
again
to
wag
their
tongues
against
your
grace
and
your
short
-
lived
popularity
wags
like
a
feather
,
which
the
next
puff
of
antiministerial
calumny
will
blow
away
 
"
"
A
pack
of
rascals
(
cried
the
duke
)
 
Tories
,
Jacobites
,
rebels
;
one
half
of
them
would
wag
their
heels
at
Tyburn
,
if
they
had
their
deserts
 
"
So
saying
,
he
wheeled
about
;
and
,
going
round
the
levee
,
spoke
to
every
individual
,
with
the
most
courteous
familiarity
;
but
he
scarce
ever
opened
his
mouth
without
making
some
blunder
,
in
relation
to
the
person
or
business
of
the
party
with
whom
he
conversed
;
so
that
he
really
looked
like
a
comedian
hired
to
burlesque
the
character
of
a
minister
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
person
of
a
very
prepossessing
appearance
coming
in
,
his
grace
ran
up
,
and
,
hugging
him
in
his
arms
,
with
the
appellation
of
"
My
dear
Ch####s
!
"
<EOS>
led
him
forthwith
into
the
inner
apartment
,
or
Sanctum
Sanctorum
of
this
political
temple
.
<EOS>
"
That
(
said
Captain
C
#
#
#
#
)
is
my
friend
C####T
#
#
#
#
,
almost
the
only
man
of
parts
who
has
any
concern
in
the
present
administration
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
would
have
no
concern
at
all
in
the
matter
,
if
the
ministry
did
not
find
it
absolutely
necessary
to
make
use
of
his
talents
upon
some
particular
occasions
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
common
business
of
the
nation
,
it
is
carried
on
in
a
constant
routine
by
the
clerks
of
the
different
offices
,
otherwise
the
wheels
of
government
would
be
wholly
stopt
amidst
the
abrupt
succession
of
ministers
,
every
one
more
ignorant
than
his
predecessor
 
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
what
a
fine
hovel
we
should
be
in
,
if
all
the
clerks
of
the
treasury
,
of
the
secretaries
,
the
war
office
,
and
the
admiralty
,
should
take
it
in
their
heads
to
throw
up
their
places
in
imitation
of
the
great
pensioner
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
to
return
to
C####T
#
#
#
#
;
he
certainly
knows
more
than
all
the
ministry
and
all
the
opposition
,
if
their
heads
were
laid
together
,
and
talks
like
an
angel
on
a
vast
variety
of
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
really
be
a
great
man
,
if
he
had
any
consistency
or
stability
of
character
 
<EOS>
Then
it
must
be
owned
,
he
wants
courage
,
otherwise
he
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
cowed
by
the
great
political
bully
,
for
whose
understanding
he
has
justly
a
very
great
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
as
much
afraid
of
that
overbearing
Hector
,
as
ever
school
-
boy
was
of
his
pedagogue
;
and
yet
this
Hector
,
I
shrewdly
suspect
,
is
no
more
than
a
craven
at
bottom
 
<EOS>
Besides
this
defect
,
C
#
#
#
#
has
another
,
which
he
is
at
too
little
pains
to
hide
 
<EOS>
There
's
no
faith
to
be
given
to
his
assertions
,
and
no
trust
to
be
put
in
his
promises
 
However
to
give
the
Devil
his
due
<EOS>
,
he
's
very
good
-
natured
;
and
even
friendly
,
when
close
urged
in
the
way
of
solicitation
  
<EOS>
As
for
principle
,
that
's
out
of
the
question
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
's
a
wit
and
an
orator
,
extremely
entertaining
,
and
he
shines
very
often
at
the
expence
even
of
those
ministers
to
whom
he
is
a
retainer
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
mark
of
great
imprudence
,
by
which
he
has
made
them
all
his
enemies
<EOS>
,
whatever
face
they
may
put
upon
the
matter
:
and
sooner
or
later
he
'll
have
cause
to
wish
he
had
been
able
to
keep
his
own
counsel
 
<EOS>
I
have
several
times
cautioned
him
on
this
subject
;
<EOS>
but
'
tis
all
preaching
to
the
desart
 
<EOS>
His
vanity
runs
away
with
his
descretion
 
<EOS>
"
I
could
not
help
thinking
the
captain
himself
might
have
been
the
better
for
some
hints
of
the
same
nature
.
  
<EOS>
His
panegyrick
,
excluding
principle
and
veracity
,
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
contest
I
once
over
-
heard
,
in
the
way
of
altercation
,
betwixt
two
apple
-
women
in
Spring
-

We
did
not
wait
for
Mr
T
#
#
#
#
's
coming
forth
;
but
after
captain
C
#
#
#
#
had
characterised
all
the
originals
in
waiting
,
we
adjourned
to
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
we
had
buttered
muffins
and
tea
to
breakfast
,
the
said
captain
still
favouring
us
with
his
company
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
my
uncle
was
so
diverted
with
his
anecdotes
,
that
he
asked
him
to
dinner
,
and
treated
him
with
a
fine
turbot
,
to
which
he
did
ample
justice
 
<EOS>
That
same
evening
I
spent
at
the
tavern
with
some
friends
,
one
of
whom
let
me
into
C
#
#
#
#
's
character
,
which
Mr
Bramble
no
sooner
understood
,
than
he
expressed
some
concern
for
the
connection
he
had
made
and
resolved
to
disengage
himself
from
it
without
,
ceremony
.
    
<EOS>
We
are
become
members
of
the
Society
for
the
Encouragement
of
the
Arts
,
and
have
assisted
at
some
of
their
deliberations
,
which
were
conducted
with
equal
spirit
and
sagacity
 
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
extremely
fond
of
the
institution
,
which
will
certainly
be
productive
of
great
advantages
to
the
public
,
if
,
from
its
democratical
form
,
it
does
not
degenerate
into
cabal
and
corruption
 
<EOS>
You
are
already
acquainted
with
his
aversion
to
the
influence
of
the
multitude
,
which
he
affirms
,
is
incompatible
with
excellence
,
and
subversive
of
order
 
<EOS>
Indeed
his
detestation
of
the
mob
has
been
heightened
by
fear
,
ever
since
he
fainted
in
the
room
at
Bath
;
and
this
apprehension
has
prevented
him
from
going
to
the
Little
Theatre
in
the
Hay
-
market
,
and
other
places
of
entertainment
,
to
which
,
however
,
I
have
had
the
honour
to
attend
the
ladies
.
    
<EOS>
It
grates
old
Square
-
Toes
to
reflect
,
that
it
is
not
in
his
power
to
enjoy
even
the
most
elegant
diversions
of
the
capital
,
without
the
participation
of
the
vulgar
;
for
they
now
thrust
themselves
into
all
assemblies
,
from
a
ridotto
at
St.
James
's
,
to
a
hop
at
Rotherhithe
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
lately
seen
our
old
acquaintance
<EOS>
Dick
Ivy
,
who
we
imagined
had
died
of
dram
-
drinking
;
but
he
is
lately
emerged
from
the
Fleet
,
by
means
of
a
pamphlet
which
he
wrote
and
published
against
the
government
with
some
success
.
<EOS>
The
sale
of
this
performance
enabled
him
to
appear
in
clean
linen
,
and
he
is
now
going
about
soliciting
subscriptions
,
for
his
Poems
;
but
his
breeches
are
not
yet
in
the
most
decent
order
.
    
<EOS>
Dick
certainly
deserves
some
countenance
for
his
intrepidity
and
perseverance
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
the
power
of
disappointment
,
nor
even
of
damnation
,
to
drive
him
to
despair
 
<EOS>
After
some
unsuccessful
essays
in
the
way
of
poetry
,
he
commenced
brandy
-
merchant
,
and
I
believe
his
whole
stock
ran
out
through
his
own
bowels
;
then
he
consorted
with
a
milkwoman
,
who
kept
a
cellar
in
Petty
France
:
but
he
could
not
make
his
quarters
good
,
he
was
dislodged
and
driven
up
stairs
into
the
kennel
by
a
corporal
in
the
second
regiment
of
foot
-
guards
 
<EOS>
He
was
afterwards
the
laureat
of
Blackfriers
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
was
a
natural
transition
to
the
Fleet
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
formerly
miscarried
in
panegyric
,
he
now
turned
his
thoughts
to
satire
,
and
really
seems
to
have
some
talent
for
abuse
.
<EOS>
If
he
can
hold
out
till
the
meeting
of
the
parliament
,
and
be
prepared
for
another
charge
,
in
all
probability
Dick
will
mount
the
pillory
,
or
obtain
a
pension
,
in
either
of
which
events
his
fortune
will
be
made
 
Mean
while
he
has
acquired
some
degree
of
consideration
with
the
respectable
writers
of
the
age
;
and
as
I
have
subscribed
for
his
works
,
he
did
me
the
favour
t'other
night
to
introduce
me
to
a
society
of
those
geniuses
;
but
I
found
them
exceeding
formal
and
reserved
  
<EOS>
They
seemed
afraid
and
jealous
of
one
another
,
and
sat
in
a
state
of
mutual
repulsion
,
like
so
many
particles
of
vapour
,
each
surrounded
by
its
own
electrified
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
Dick
,
who
has
more
vivacity
than
judgment
,
tried
more
than
once
to
enliven
the
conversation
;
sometimes
making
an
effort
at
wit
,
sometimes
letting
off
a
pun
,
and
sometimes
discharging
a
conundrum
;
nay
at
length
he
started
a
dispute
upon
the
hackneyed
comparison
betwixt
blank
verse
and
rhyme
,
and
the
professors
opened
with
great
clamour
;
but
,
instead
of
keeping
to
the
subject
,
they
launched
out
into
tedious
dissertations
on
the
poetry
of
the
ancients
;
and
one
of
them
who
had
been
a
school
-
master
,
displayed
his
whole
knowledge
of
prosody
,
gleaned
from
Disputer
and
Ruddiman
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
I
ventured
to
say
,
I
did
not
see
how
the
subject
in
question
could
be
at
all
elucidated
by
the
practice
of
the
ancients
,
who
certainly
had
neither
blank
verse
nor
rhyme
in
their
poems
,
which
were
measured
by
feet
,
whereas
ours
are
reckoned
by
the
number
of
syllables
 
<EOS>
This
remark
seemed
to
give
umbrage
to
the
pedant
,
who
forthwith
involved
himself
in
a
cloud
of
Greek
and
Latin
quotations
,
which
nobody
attempted
to
dispel
 
A
confused
hum
of
insipid
observations
and
comments
ensued
;
and
,
upon
the
whole
,
I
never
passed
a
duller
evening
in
my
life
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
without
all
doubt
,
some
of
them
were
men
of
learning
,
wit
,
and
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
As
they
are
afraid
of
making
free
with
one
another
,
they
should
bring
each
his
but
,
or
whet
-
stone
,
along
with
him
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
says
,
he
never
desires
to
meet
with
more
than
one
wit
at
a
time
 
One
wit
like
a
nuckle
of
ham
in
soup
,
gives
a
zest
and
flavour
to
the
dish
;
but
more
than
one
serves
only
to
spoil
the
pottage
 
<EOS>
And
now
I
'm
afraid
I
have
given
you
an
unconscionable
mess
,
without
any
flavour
at
all
,
for
which
,
I
suppose
,
you
will
bestow
your
benedictions
upon
    
your
friend
and
servant

To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
YOUR
fable
of
the
monkey
and
the
pig
,
is
what
the
Italians
call
ben
trovata
:
but
I
shall
not
repeat
it
to
my
apothecary
,
who
is
a
proud
Scotchman
,
very
thin
skinned
,
and
,
for
aught
I
know
,
may
have
his
degree
in
his
pocket
 
<EOS>
A
right
Scotchman
has
always
two
strings
to
his
bow
,
and
is
in
utrumque
paratus
 
Certain
<EOS>
it
is
,
I
have
not
"
scaped
a
scouring
;
but
I
believe
,
by
means
of
that
scouring
,
I
have
"
scaped
something
worse
,
perhaps
a
tedious
fit
of
the
gout
or
rheumatism
;
for
my
appetite
began
to
flagg
,
and
I
had
certain
croakings
in
the
bowels
which
boded
me
no
good
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
am
not
yet
quite
free
of
these
remembrances
,
which
warn
me
to
be
gone
from
this
centre
of
infection
     
<EOS>
What
temptation
can
a
man
of
my
turn
and
temperament
<EOS>
have
,
to
live
in
a
place
where
every
corner
teems
with
fresh
objects
of
detestation
and
disgust
?
<EOS>
What
kind
of
taste
and
organs
must
those
people
have
,
who
really
prefer
the
adulterate
enjoyments
of
the
town
to
the
genuine
pleasures
of
a
country
retreat
?
<EOS>
Most
people
,
I
know
,
are
originally
seduced
by
vanity
,
ambition
,
and
childish
curiosity
;
which
can
not
be
gratified
,
but
in
the
busy
haunts
of
men
:
but
,
in
the
course
of
this
gratification
,
their
very
organs
of
sense
are
perverted
,
and
they
become
habitually
lost
to
every
relish
of
what
is
genuine
and
excellent
in
its
own
nature
.
    
<EOS>
Shall
I
state
the
difference
between
my
town
grievances
,
and
my
country
comforts
?
<EOS>
At
Brambleton
-
hall
,
I
have
elbow
-
room
within
doors
,
and
breathe
a
clear
,
elastic
,
salutary
air
 
I
enjoy
refreshing
sleep
,
which
is
never
disturbed
by
horrid
noise
,
nor
interrupted
,
but
in
a
morning
,
by
the
sweet
twitter
of
the
martlet
at
my
window
 
<EOS>
I
drink
the
virgin
lymph
,
pure
and
crystalline
as
it
gushes
from
the
rock
,
or
the
sparkling
beverage
,
home
brewed
from
malt
of
my
own
making
;
or
I
indulge
with
cider
,
which
my
own
orchard
affords
;
or
with
claret
of
the
best
growth
,
imported
for
my
own
use
,
by
a
correspondent
on
whose
integrity
I
can
depend
;
my
bread
is
sweet
and
nourishing
,
made
from
my
own
wheat
,
ground
in
my
own
mill
,
and
baked
in
my
own
oven
,
my
table
is
,
in
a
great
measure
,
furnished
from
my
own
ground
;
my
five
-
year
old
mutton
,
fed
on
the
fragrant
herbage
of
the
mountains
,
that
might
vie
with
venison
in
juice
and
flavour
;
my
delicious
veal
,
fattened
with
nothing
but
the
mother
's
milk
,
that
fills
the
dish
with
gravy
;
my
poultry
from
the
barn
-
door
,
that
never
knew
confinement
,
but
when
they
were
at
roost
;
my
rabbits
panting
from
the
warren
;
my
game
fresh
from
the
moors
;
my
trout
and
salmon
struggling
from
the
stream
;
oysters
from
their
native
banks
;
and
herrings
,
with
other
sea
-
fish
,
I
can
eat
in
four
hours
after
they
are
taken
 
My
sallads
,
roots
,
and
pot
-
herbs
,
my
own
garden
yeilds
in
plenty
and
perfection
;
the
produce
of
the
natural
soil
,
prepared
by
moderate
cultivation
.
<EOS>
The
same
soil
affords
all
the
different
fruits
which
England
may
call
her
own
,
so
that
my
desert
is
every
day
fresh
-
gathered
from
the
tree
;
my
dairy
flows
with
nectarious
tides
of
milk
and
cream
,
from
whence
we
derive
abundance
of
excellent
butter
,
curds
,
and
cheese
;
and
the
refuse
fattens
my
pigs
,
that
are
destined
for
hams
and
bacon
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
by
times
,
and
rise
with
the
sun
 
<EOS>
I
make
shift
to
pass
the
hours
without
weariness
or
regret
,
and
am
not
destitute
of
amusements
within
doors
,
when
the
weather
will
not
permit
me
to
go
abroad
 
<EOS>
I
read
,
and
chat
,
and
play
at
billiards
,
cards
,
or
back
-
gammon
 
<EOS>
Without
doors
,
I
superintend
my
farm
,
and
execute
plans
of
improvement
,
the
effects
of
which
I
enjoy
with
unspeakable
delight
 
<EOS>
Nor
do
I
take
less
pleasure
in
seeing
my
tenants
thrive
under
my
auspices
,
and
the
poor
live
comfortably
by
the
employment
which
I
provide
 
<EOS>
You
know
I
have
one
or
two
sensible
friends
,
to
whom
I
can
open
all
my
heart
;
a
blessing
which
,
perhaps
,
I
might
have
sought
in
vain
among
the
crowded
scenes
of
life
:
there
are
few
others
of
more
humble
parts
,
whom
I
esteem
for
their
integrity
;
and
their
conversation
I
find
inoffensive
,
though
not
very
entertaining
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
I
live
in
the
midst
of
honest
men
,
and
trusty
dependants
,
who
,
I
flatter
myself
,
have
a
disinterested
attachment
to
my
person
 
You
,
yourself
,
my
dear
Doctor
,
can
vouch
for
the
truth
of
these
assertions
.
    
<EOS>
Now
mark
the
contrast
at
London
 
<EOS>
I
am
pent
up
in
frowzy
lodgings
,
where
there
is
not
room
enough
to
swing
a
cat
;
and
I
breathe
the
steams
of
endless
putrefaction
;
and
these
would
,
undoubtedly
,
produce
a
pestilence
,
if
they
were
not
qualified
by
the
gross
acid
of
sea
-
coal
,
which
is
itself
a
pernicious
nuisance
to
lungs
of
any
delicacy
of
texture
:
but
even
this
boasted
corrector
can
not
prevent
those
languid
,
sallow
looks
,
<EOS>
that
distinguish
the
inhabitants
of
London
from
those
ruddy
swains
that
lead
a
country
life
 
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
after
mid
-
night
,
jaded
and
restless
from
the
dissipations
of
the
day
 
I
start
every
hour
from
my
sleep
,
at
the
horrid
noise
of
the
watchmen
bawling
the
hour
through
every
street
,
and
thundering
at
every
door
;
a
set
of
useless
fellows
,
who
serve
no
other
purpose
but
that
of
disturbing
the
repose
of
the
inhabitants
;
and
by
five
o'clock
I
start
out
of
bed
,
in
consequence
of
the
still
more
dreadful
alarm
made
by
the
country
carts
,
and
noisy
rustics
bellowing
green
pease
under
my
window
.
<EOS>
If
I
would
drink
water
,
I
must
quaff
the
maukish
contents
of
an
open
aqueduct
,
exposed
to
all
manner
of
defilement
;
or
swallow
that
which
comes
from
the
river
Thames
,
impregnated
with
all
the
filth
of
London
and
Westminster
 
<EOS>
Human
excrement
is
the
least
offensive
part
of
the
concrete
,
which
is
composed
of
all
the
drugs
,
minerals
,
and
poisons
,
used
in
mechanics
and
manufacture
,
enriched
with
the
putryfying
carcases
of
beasts
and
men
;
and
mixed
with
the
scourings
of
all
the
wash
-
tubs
,
kennels
,
and
common
sewers
within
the
bills
of
mortality
.
    
<EOS>
This
is
the
agreeable
potation
,
extolled
by
the
Londoners
,
as
the
finest
water
in
the
universe
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
intoxicating
potion
,
sold
for
wine
,
it
is
a
vile
,
unpalatable
,
and
pernicious
sophistication
,
balderdashed
with
cider
,
corn
-
spirit
,
and
the
juice
of
sloes
.
<EOS>
In
an
action
at
law
,
laid
against
a
carman
for
having
slaved
a
cask
of
port
,
it
appeared
from
the
evidence
of
the
cooper
,
that
there
were
not
above
five
gallons
of
real
wine
in
the
whole
pipe
,
which
held
above
a
hundred
,
and
even
that
had
been
brewed
and
adulterated
by
the
merchant
at
Oporto
.
<EOS>
The
bread
I
eat
in
London
,
is
a
deleterious
paste
,
mixed
up
with
chalk
,
alum
and
bone
-
ashes
;
insipid
to
the
taste
,
and
destructive
to
the
constitution
.
<EOS>
The
good
people
are
not
ignorant
of
this
adulteration
;
but
they
prefer
it
to
wholesome
bread
,
because
it
is
whiter
than
the
meal
of
corn
:
thus
they
sacrifice
their
taste
and
their
health
,
and
the
lives
of
their
tender
infants
,
to
a
most
absurd
gratification
of
a
mis
-
judging
eye
;
and
the
miller
,
or
the
baker
,
is
obliged
to
poison
them
and
their
families
,
in
order
to
live
by
his
profession
.
<EOS>
The
same
monstrous
depravity
appears
in
their
veal
,
which
is
bleached
by
repeated
bleedings
,
and
other
villanous
arts
,
till
there
is
not
a
drop
of
juice
left
in
the
body
,
and
the
poor
animal
is
paralytic
before
it
dies
;
so
void
of
all
taste
,
nourishment
,
and
savour
,
that
a
man
might
dine
as
comfortably
on
a
white
fricasee
of
kid
-
skin
gloves
,
or
chip
hats
from
Leghorn
.
    
<EOS>
As
they
have
discharged
the
natural
colour
from
their
bread
,
their
butchers
meat
,
and
poultry
,
their
cutlets
,
ragouts
,
fricassees
,
and
sauces
of
all
kinds
;
so
they
insist
upon
having
the
complexion
of
their
pot
-
herbs
mended
,
even
at
the
hazard
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
you
will
hardly
believe
they
can
be
so
mad
as
to
boil
their
greens
with
brass
halfpence
,
in
order
to
improve
their
colour
;
and
yet
nothing
is
more
true
 
Indeed
,
without
this
improvement
in
the
colour
,
they
have
no
personal
merit
.
<EOS>
They
are
produced
in
an
artificial
soil
,
and
taste
of
nothing
but
the
dunghills
,
from
whence
they
spring

<EOS>
My
cabbage
,
cauliflower
,
and
"
sparagus
in
the
country
,
are
as
much
superior
in
flavour
to
those
that
are
sold
in
Covent
-
garden
,
as
my
heath
-
mutton
is
to
that
of
St.
James's
-
market
;
which
in
fact
,
is
neither
lamb
nor
mutton
,
but
something
betwixt
the
two
,
gorged
in
the
rank
fens
of
Lincoln

Essex

pale

coarse

frowzy

As
for
the
pork
,
it
is
an
abominable
carnivorous
animal
,
fed
with
horseflesh
and
distillers
grains
;
and
the
poultry
is
all
rotten
,
in
consequence
of
a
fever
,
occasioned
by
the
infamous
practice
of
sewing
up
the
gut
,
that
they
may
be
the

fattened
in
coops

in
consequence
of
this
cruel
retention

<EOS>
Of
the
fish
,
I
need
say
nothing
in
this
hot
weather
,
but
that
it
comes
sixty

seventy
,
fourscore
and
a
hundred
miles
by
land

carriage
;
a
circumstance
sufficient
,
without
any
comment
,
to
turn
a
Dutchman

stomach

even

his
nose
was
not
saluted

with
the
sweet

fresh

This
is
not
the

nevertheless
,
it
may
not
be
amiss
to
mention
,
that
the

Colchester
are
kept
in
slime
-
pits
,
occasionally
overflowed
by
the
sea
;
and
that
the
green
colour
,
so
much
admired
by
the
voluptuaries
of
this
metropolis
,
is
occasioned
by
the
vitriolic
scum
,
which
rises
on
the
surface
of
the
stagnant

stinking

<EOS>
Our
rabbits
are
bred
and
fed
in
a
poulterer
's
cellar
,
where
they
have
neither
air

exercise

consequently
they
must
be
firm
in
flesh
,
and
delicious
in
flavour

there
is
no
game
to
be
had
for
love
or

<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
that
Covent
-
Garden
affords
some
good
fruit
;
which
,
however
,
is
always
engrossed
by
a
few
individuals
of
over
-
grown
fortune
,
at
an
exorbitant
price
;
so
that
little
else
than
the
refuse
of
the
market
falls
to
the
share
of
the
community
;
and
that
is
distributed
by
such
filthy
hands
,
as
I
can
not
look
at
without
loathing
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
yesterday
that
I
saw
a
dirty
barrow
-
bunter
,
in
the
street
,
cleaning
her
dusty
fruit
with
her
own
spittle
;
and
who
knows
but
some
fine
lady
of
St.
James
's
parish
might
admit
into
her
delicate
mouth
those
very
cherries
,
which
had
been
rolled
and
moistened
between
the
filthy
,
and
,
perhaps
,
ulcerated
chops
of
a
St.

huckster
 
<EOS>
I
need
not
dwell
upon
the
pallid
,
contaminated
mash
,
which
they
call
strawberries
;
soiled
and
tossed
by
greasy
paws
through
twenty
baskets
crusted
with
dirt
and
then
presented
with
the
worst
milk
,
<EOS>
thickened
with
the
worst
flour
into
a
bad
likeness
of
cream
:
but
the
milk
itself
should
not
pass
unanalysed
,
the
produce
of
faded
cabbage
-
leaves
and
sour
draff
,
lowered
with
hot
water
,
frothed
with
bruised
snails
,
carried
through
the
streets
in
open
pails
,
exposed
to
foul
rinsings
,
discharged
from
doors
and
windows
,
spittle
,
snot

and
tobacco
-
quids
from
foot
passengers
,
overflowings
from
mud

,
spatterings
from
coach

dirt
and
trash
chucked
into
it
by
roguish
boys
for
the
joke's

sake
,
the
spewings
of
infants
,
who
have
slabbered
in
the
tin

measure
,
which
is
thrown
back
in
that
condition
among
the
milk
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
next
customer
;
and
,
finally
,
the
vermin
that
drops
from
the
rags
of
the
nasty
drab
that
vends
this
precious
mixture
,
under
the
respectable
denomination
of

<EOS>
I
shall
conclude
this
catalogues
of
London
dainties
,
with
that
table
-
beer
,
guiltless
of
hops
and
malt
,
vapid
and
nauseous
;
much
fitter
to
facilitate
the
operation
of
a
vomit
,
than
to
quench
thirst
and
promote
digestion
;
the
tallowy
rancid
mass
,
called
butter
,
manufactured
with
candle
-
grease
and
kitchen
-
stuff
;
and
their
fresh
eggs
,
imported
from
France
and
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
all
these
enormities
might
be
remedied
with
a
very
little
attention
to
the
article
of
police
,
or
civil
regulation
;
but
the
wise
patriots
of
London
have
taken
it
into
their
heads
,
that
all
regulation
is
inconsistent
with
liberty
;
and
that
every
man
ought
to
live
in
his
own
way
,
without
restraint
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
as
there
is
not
sense
enough
left
among
them
,
to
be
discomposed
by
the
nuisances
I
have
mentioned
,
they
may
,
for
aught
I
care
,
wallow
in
the
mire
of
their
own
pollution

A
companionable
man
will
,
undoubtedly
,
put
up
with
many
inconveniences
for
the
sake
of
enjoying
agreeable

A

,
the

a

which

ought

taken

what
is
the

that
I

tempted

for
its

to
mortify
my
senses

compound
with
such
uncleanness

abhors

All

any

Even
in

those

DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
IN
my
last
,
I
mentioned
my
having
spent
an
evening
with
a
society
of
authors
,
who
seemed
to
be
jealous
and
afraid
of
one
another
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
not
at
all
surprised
to
hear
me
say
I
was
disappointed
in
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
may
be
very
entertaining
and
instructive
upon
paper
,
(
said
he
)
and
exceedingly
dull
in
common
discourse
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
,
that
those
who
shine
most
in
private
company
,
are
but
secondary
stars
in
the
constellation
of
genius
 
A
small
stock
of
ideas
is
more
easily
managed
,
and
sooner
displayed
than
a
great
quantity
crowded
together
.
<EOS>
There
is
very
seldom
any
thing
extraordinary
in
the
appearance
and
address
of
a
good
writer
;
whereas
a
dull
author
generally
distinguishes
himself
by
some
oddity
or
extravagance
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
I
fancy
,
that
an
assembly
of
Grubs
must
be
very
diverting
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
curiosity
being
excited
by
this
hint
,
I
consulted
my
friend
Dick
Ivy
,
who
undertook
to
gratify
it
the
very
next
day
,
which
was
Sunday
last
.
  
<EOS>
He
carried
me
to
dine
with
S
#
#
#
#
,
whom
you
and
I
have
long
known
by
his
writings
.
  
<EOS>
He
lives
in
the
skirts
of
the
town
,
and
every
Sunday
his
house
is
open
to
all
unfortunate
brothers
of
the
quill
,
whom
he
treats
with
beef
,
pudding
,
and
potatoes
,
port
,
punch
,
and
Calvert
's
entire
butt
beer
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
fixed
upon
the
first
day
of
the
week
for
the
exercise
of
his
hospitality
,
because
some
of
his
guests
could
not
enjoy
it
on
any
other
,
for
reasons
that
I
need
not
explain
.
<EOS>
I
was
civilly
received
in
a
plain
,
yet
decent
habitation
,
which
opened
backwards
into
a
very
pleasant
garden
,
kept
in
excellent
order
;
and
indeed
,
I
saw
,
none
of
the
outward
signs
of
authorship
,
either
in
the
house
or
the
landlord
,
who
is
one
of
those
few
writers
of
the
age
that
stand
upon
their
own
foundation
,
without
patronage
,
and
above
dependence
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
nothing
characteristic
in
the
entertainer
,
the
company
made
ample
amends
for
his
want
of
singularity
.
    
<EOS>
At
two
in
the
after
-
noon
,
I
found
myself
one
of
ten
mess
-
mates
seated
at
table
;
and
,
I
question
,
if
the
whole
kingdom
could
produce
such
another
assemblage
of
originals
.
<EOS>
Among
their
peculiarities
,
I
do
not
mention
those
of
dress
,
which
may
be
purely
accidental
.
<EOS>
What
struck
me
were
oddities
originally
produced
by
affectation
,
and
afterwards
confirmed
by
habit
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
wore
spectacles
at
dinner
,
and
another
,
his
hat
flapped
;
though
(
as
Ivy
told
me
)
<EOS>
the
first
was
noted
for
having
a
seaman
's
eye
,
when
a
bailiff
was
in
the
wind
;
and
the
other
was
never
known
to
labour
under
any
weakness
or
defect
of
vision
,
except
about
five
years
ago
,
when
he
was
complimented
with
a
couple
of
black
eyes
by
a
player
,
with
whom
he
had
quarrelled
in
his
drink
.
<EOS>
A
third
wore
a
laced
stocking
,
and
made
use
of
crutches
,
because
,
once
in
his
life
,
he
had
been
laid
up
with
a
broken
leg
,
though
no
man
could
leap
over
a
stick
with
more
agility
.
<EOS>
A
fourth
had
contracted
such
an
antipathy
to
the
country
,
that
he
insisted
upon
sitting
with
his
back
towards
the
window
that
looked
into
the
garden
,
and
when
a
dish
of
cauliflower
was
set
upon
the
table
,
he
snuffed
up
volatile
salts
to
keep
him
from
fainting
;
yet
this
delicate
person
was
the
son
of
a
cottager
,
born
under
a
hedge
,
and
had
many
years
run
wild
among
asses
on
a
common
.
<EOS>
A
fifth
affected
distraction
 
<EOS>
When
spoke
to
,
he
always
answered
from
the
purpose
  
sometimes
he
suddenly
started
up
,
and
rapped
out
a
dreadful
oath
 
sometimes
he
burst
out
a
-
laughing
  
<EOS>
then
he
folded
his
arms
,
and
sighed
 
<EOS>
and
then
he
hissed
like
fifty
serpents
.
    
<EOS>
At
first
,
I
really
thought
he
was
mad
,
and
,
as
he
sat
near
me
,
began
to
be
under
some
apprehensions
for
my
own
safety
,
when
our
landlord
,
perceiving
me
alarmed
,
assured
me
aloud
that
I
had
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
"
The
gentleman
(
said
he
)
is
trying
to
act
a
part
,
for
which
he
is
by
no
means
qualified
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
all
the
inclination
in
the
world
,
it
is
not
in
his
power
to
be
mad
.
<EOS>
His
spirits
are
too
flat
to
be
kindled
into
frenzy
.
<EOS>

An

stuttering

replied
our
landlord
;
tho
'
,
<EOS>
God
knows
,
there
is
no

.
<EOS>
"
It
seems
,
this
wag
,
after
having
made
some
abortive
attempts
in
plain
speaking
,
had
recourse
to
this
defect
,
by
means
of
which
he
frequently
extorted
the
laugh
of
the
company
,
without
the
least
expence
of
genius
;
and
that
imperfection
,
which
he
had
at
first
counterfeited
,
was
now
become
so
habitual
,
that
he
could
not
lay
it
aside
.
    
<EOS>
A
certain
winking
genius
,
who
wore
yellow
gloves
at
dinner
,
had
on
his
first
introduction
,
taken
such
offence
at
S
#
#
#
#
,
because
he
looked
and
talked
,
and
ate
and
drank
like
any
other
man
,
that
he
spoke
contemptuously
of
his
understanding
ever
after
,
and
never
would
repeat
his
visit
,
until
he
had
exhibited
the
following
proof
of
his
caprice
.
<EOS>
Wat
Wyvil
,
the
poet
,
having
made
some
unsuccessful
advances
towards
an
intimacy
with
S
#
#
#
#
,
at
last
gave
him
to
understand
,
by
a
third
person
,
that
he
had
written
a
poem
in
his
praise
,
and
a
satire
against
his
person
;
that
if
he
would
admit
him
to
his
house
,
the
first
should
be
immediately
sent
to
press
;
but
that
if
he
persisted
in
declining
his
friendship
,
he
would
publish
the
satire
without
delay
.
<EOS>
S
#
#
#
#
replied
,
that
he
looked
upon
Wyvil
's
panegyrick
,
as
in
effect
,
a
species
of
infamy
,
and
would
resent
it
accordingly
with
a
good
cudgel
;
but
if
he
published
the
satire
,
he
might
deserve
his
compassion
,
and
had
nothing
to
fear
from
his
revenge
.
<EOS>
Wyvil
having
considered
the
alternative
,
resolved
to
mortify
S
#
#
#
#
by
printing
the
panegyrick
,
for
which
he
received
a
found
drubbing
.
<EOS>
Then
he
swore
the
peace
against
the
agressor
,
who
,
in
order
to
avoid
a
prosecution
,
at
law
,
admitted
him
to
his
good
graces
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
singularity
in
S
#
#
#
#
's
conduct
on
this
occasion
,
that
reconciled
him
to
the
yellow
-
gloved
philosopher
,
who
owned
he
had
some
genius
,
and
from
that
period
cultivated
his
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
Curious
to
know
upon
what
subjects
the
several
talents
of
my
fellow
-
guests
were
employed
,
I
applied
to
my
communicative
friend
Dick
Ivy
,
who
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
most
of
them
were
,
or
had
been
,
understrappers
,
or
journeymen
,
to
more
creditable
authors
,
for
whom
they
translated
,
collated
,
and
compiled
,
in
the
business
of
book
-
making
;
and
that
all
of
them
had
,
at
different
times
,
laboured
in
the
service
of
our
landlord
,
though
they
had
now
set
up
for
themselves
in
various
departments
of
literature
.
<EOS>
Not
only
their
talents
,
but
also
their
nations
and
dialects
were
so
various
,
that
our
conversation
resembled
the
confusion
of
tongues
at
Babel
.
    
<EOS>
We
had
the
Irish
brogue
the
Scotch
accent
,
and
foreign
Idiom
,
twanged
off
by
the
most
discordant
vociferation
;
for
,
as
they
all
spoke
together
,
no
man
had
any
chance
to
be
heard
,
unless
he
could
bawl
lowder
than
his
fellows
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
however
,
there
was
nothing
pedantic
in
their
discourse
;
they
carefully
avoided
all
learned
disquisitions
,
and
endeavoured
to
be
facetious
;
nor
did
their
endeavours
always
miscarry
 
some
droll
repartee
passed
,
and
much
laughter
was
excited
;
and
if
any
individual
lost
his
temper
so
far
as
to
transgress
the
bounds
of
decorum
,
he
was
effectually
checked
by
the
master
of
the
feast
,
who
exerted
a
sort
of
paternal
authority
over
this
irritable
tribe
.

The
most
learned
philosopher
of
the
whole
collection
,
who
had
been
expelled
the
university
for
atheism
,
has
made
great
progress
in
a
refutation
of
lord
Bolingbroke
's
metaphysical
works
,
which
is
said
to
be
equally
ingenious
and
orthodox
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
he
has
been
presented
to
the
grand
jury
as
a
public
nuisance
,
for
having
blasphemed
in
an
alehouse
on
the
Lord

The
Irishman
is
a
political
writer
,
and
goes
by
the
name
of
my
Lord
Potatoe
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
pamphlet
in
vindication
of
a
minister
,
hoping
his
zeal
would
be
rewarded
by
some
place
or
pension
;
but
finding
himself
neglected
in
that
quarter
,
he
whispered
about
that
the
pamphlet
was
written
by
the
minister
himself
,
and
he
published
an
answer
to
his
own
production
.
<EOS>
In
this
he
addressed
the
author
,
under
the
title
of
your
lordship
,
with
such
solemnity
,
that
the
public
swallowed
the
deceit
,
and
bought
up
the
whole
impression
.

The
wise
politicians
of
the
metropolis
declared
they
were
both
masterly
performances
,
and
chuckled
over
the
flimsey
reveries
of
an
ignorant
garetteer
,
as
the
profound
speculations
of
a
veteran
statesman
,
acquainted
with
all
the
secrets
of
the
cabinet
.
<EOS>
The
imposture
was
detected
in
the
sequel
;
and
our
Hibernian

retains
no

of
his
assumed

Opposite
to
me
sat
a
Piedmontese
,
who
had
obliged
the
public
with
a
humourous
satire
,
intituled
,
The
Balance
of
the
English
Poets
,
a
performance
which
evinced
the
great
modesty
and
taste
of
the
author
,
and
,
in
particular
,
his
intimacies
with
the
elegancies
of
the
English

.

The
sage
,
who
laboured
under
the
agrofobia
or
horror
of
green
fields
,
had
just
finished
a
treatise
on
practical
agriculture
,
though
in
fact
he
had
never
seen
corn
growing
in
his
life
,
and
was
so
ignorant
of
grain
,
that
our
entertainer
,
in
the
face
of
the
whole
company
,
made
him
own
,
that
a
plate
of
hominy
was
the
best
rice
pudding
he
had
ever
eat
.
    
<EOS>
The
stutterer
had
almost
finished
his
travels
through
Europe
and
part
of
Asia
,
without
ever
budging
beyond
the
liberties
of
the
King
's
Bench
,
except
in
term
time
,
with
a
tipstaff
for
his
companion
;
and
as
for
little
Tim
Cropdale
,
the
most
facetious
member
of
the
whole
society
,
he
had
happily
wound
up
the
catastrophe
of
a
virgin
tragedy
,
from
the
exhibition
of
which
he
promised
himself
a
large
fund
of
profit
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
Tim
had
made
shift
to
live
many
years
by
writing
novels
,
at
the
rate
of
five
pounds
a
volume
;
but
that
branch
of
business
is
now
engrossed
by
female
authors
,
who
publish
merely
for
the
propagation
of
virtue
,
with
so
much
ease
,
and
spirit
,
and
delicacy
,
and
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
,
and
all
in
the
serene
tranquillity
of
high
life
,
that
the
reader
is
not
only
inchanted
by
their
genius
,
but
reformed
by
their
morality
.
    
<EOS>
After
dinner
we
adjourned
into
the
garden
,
where
,
I
observed
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
gave
a
short
separate
audience
to
every
individual
in
a
small
remote
filbert
walk
,
from
whence
most
of
them
dropped
off
one
after
another
,
without
further
ceremony
;
but
they
were
replaced
by
fresh
recruits
of
the
same
clan
,
who
came
to
make
an
afternoon
's
visit
;
and
,
among
others
,
a
spruce
bookseller
,
called
Birkin
,
who
rode
his
own
gelding
,
and
made
his
appearance
in
a
pair
of
new
jemmy
boots
,
with
massy
spurs
of
plate
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
reason
that
this
midwife
of
the
muses
used
exercise
a
-
horseback
,
for
he
was
too
fat
to
walk
a
-
foot
,
and
he
underwent
some
sarcasms
from
Tim
Cropdale
,
on
his
unwieldy
size
and
inaptitude
for
motion
.
<EOS>
Birkin
,
who
took
umbrage
at
this
poor
author
's
petulence
in
presuming
to
joke
upon
a
man
so
much
richer
than
himself
,
told
him
,
he
was
not
so
unwieldy
but
that
he
could
move
the
marshalsea
court
for
a
writ
,
and
even
overtake
him
with
it
,
if
he
did
not
very
speedily
come
and
settle
accounts
with
him
,
respecting
the
expence
of
publishing
his
last
Ode
to
the
king
of
Prussia
,
of
which
he
had
sold
but
three
,
and
one
of
them
was
to
Whitfield
the
methodist
.
<EOS>
Tim
affected
to
receive
this
intimation
with
good
humour
,
saying
,
he
expected
in
a
post
or
two
,
from
Potsdam
,
a
poem
of
thanks
from
his
Prussian
majesty
,
who
knew
very
well
how
to
pay
poets
in
their
own
coin
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
he
proposed
,
that
Mr
Birkin
and
he
should
run
three
times
round
the
garden
for
a
bowl
of
punch
,
to
be
drank
at
Ashley
's
in
the
evening
,
and
he
would
run
boots
against
stockings
.
<EOS>
The
bookseller
,
who
valued
himself
upon
his
mettle
,
was
persuaded
to
accept
the
challenge
,
and
he
forthwith
resigned
his
boots
to
Cropdale
,
who
,
when
he
had
put
them
on
,
was
no
bad
representation
of
Captain
Pistol
in
the
play
.
    
<EOS>
Every
thing
being
adjusted
,
they
started
together
with
great
impetuosity
,
and
,
in
the
second
round
,
Birkin
had
clearly
the
advantage
,
larding
the
lean
earth
as
he
puff'd
along
.
<EOS>
Cropdale
had
no
mind
to
contest
the
victory
further
,
but
,
in
a
twinkling
,
disappeared
through
the
back
-
door
of
the
garden
,
which
opened
into
a
private
lane
,
that
had
communication
with
the
high
road
.
  
<EOS>
The
spectators
immediately
began
to
hallo
,
"
Stole
away
!
"
<EOS>
and
Birkin
set
off
in
pursuit
of
him
with
great
eagerness
;
but
he
had
not
advanced
twenty
yards
in
the
lane
,
when
a
thorn
running
into
his
foot
,
sent
him
hopping
back
into
the
garden
,
roaring
with
pain
,
and
swearing
with
vexation
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
delivered
from
this
annoyance
by
the
Scotchman
,
who
had
been
bred
to
surgery
,
he
looked
about
him
wildly
,
exclaiming
,
"
Sure
,
the
fellow
wo
n't
be
such
a
rogue
as
to
run
clear
away
with
my
boots
!
"
<EOS>
Our
landlord
,
having
reconnoitred
the
shoes
he
had
left
,
which
,
indeed
,
hardly
deserved
that
name
,
"
Pray
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
Mr
Birkin
,
wa'n't
your
boots
made
of
calf
-
skin
?
"
<EOS>
"
Calfskin
or
cow
skin
(
replied
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
'll
find
a
slip
of
sheep
-
skin
that
will
do
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
I
lost
twenty
pounds
by
his
farce
,
which
you
persuaded
me
to
buy
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
out
of
pocket
five
pounds
by
his
damn'd
ode
;
and
now
this
pair
of
boots
,
bran
new
,
cost
me
thirty
shillings
,
as
per
receipt
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
affair
of
the
boots
is
felony
 
transportation
.
  
<EOS>
I
'll
have
the
dog
indicted
at
the
Old
Bailey
  
<EOS>
I
will
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
revenged
,
even
though
I
should
lose
my
debt
in
consequence
of
his
conviction
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
said
nothing
at
present
,
but
accommodated
him
with
a
pair
of
shoes
;
then
ordered
his
servant
to
rub
him
down
,
and
comfort
him
with
a
glass
of
rum
punch
,
which
seemed
,
in
a
great
measure
,
to
cool
the
rage
of
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
(
said
our
landlord
)
<EOS>
this
is
no
more
than
a
humbug
in
the
way
of
wit
;
though
it
deserves
a
more
respectable
epithet
,
when
considered
as
an
effort
of
invention
.
<EOS>
Tim
being
,
I
suppose
,
out
of
credit
with
the
cordwainer
,
fell
upon
this
ingenious
expedient
to
supply
the
want
of
shoes
,
knowing
that
Mr
Birkin
,
who
loves
humour
,
would
himself
relish
the
joke
upon
a
little
recollection
.
<EOS>
Cropdale
literally
lives
by
his
wit
,
which
he
has
exercised
upon
all
his
friends
in
their
turns
.
<EOS>
He
once
borrowed
my
poney
for
five
or
six
days
to
go
to
Salisbury
,
and
sold
him
in
Smithfield
at
his
return
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
joke
of
such
a
serious
nature
,
that
,
in
the
first
transports
of
my
passion
,
I
had
some
thoughts
of
prosecuting
him
for
horse
-
stealing
;
and
even
when
my
resentment
had
in
some
measure
subsided
,
as
he
industriously
avoided
me
<EOS>
,
I
vowed
,
I
would
take
satisfaction
on
his
ribs
with
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
seeing
him
at
some
distance
in
the
street
,
coming
towards
me
,
I
began
to
prepare
my
cane
for
action
,
and
walked
in
the
shadow
of
a
porter
,
that
he
might
not
perceive
me
soon
enough
to
make
his
escape
;
but
,
in
the
very
instant
I
had
lifted
up
the
instrument
of
correction
,
I
found
Tim
Cropdale
metamorphosed
into
a
miserable
blind
wretch
,
feeling
his
way
with
a
long
stick
from
post
to
post
,
and
rolling
about
two
bald
unlighted
orbs
instead
of
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
was
exceedingly
shocked
at
having
so
narrowly
escaped
the
concern
and
disgrace
that
would
have
attended
such
a
misapplication
of
vengeance
;
<EOS>
but
,
next
day
,
Tim
prevailed
on
a
friend
of
mine
to
come
and
solicit
my
forgiveness
,
and
offer
his
note
,
payable
in
six
weeks
,
for
the
price
of
the
poney
.
  
<EOS>
This
gentleman
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
the
blind
man
was
no
other
than
Cropdale
,
who
having
seen
me
advancing
,
and
guessing
my
intent
,
had
immediately
converted
himself
into
the
object
aforesaid
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
so
diverted
at
the
ingenuity
of
the
evasion
,
that
I
agreed
to
pardon
his
offence
,
refusing
his
note
,
however
,
that
I
might
keep
a
prosecution
for
felony
hanging
over
his
head
,
as
a
security
for
his
future
good
behaviour
 
<EOS>
But
Timothy
would
by
no
means
trust
himself
in
my
hands
till
the
note
was
accepted
 
<EOS>
then
he
made
his
appearance
at
my
door
as
a
blind
beggar
,
and
imposed
in
such
a
manner
upon
my
man
,
who
had
been
his
old
acquaintance
and
pot
-
companion
,
that
the
fellow
threw
the
door
in
his
face
and
even
threatened
to
give
him
the
bastinado
.
<EOS>
Hearing
a
noise
in
the
hall
,
I
went
thither
,
and
immediately
recollecting
the
figure
I
had
passed
in
the
street
,
accosted
him
by
his
own
name
,
to
the
unspeakable
astonishment
of
the
footman
.
"
    
<EOS>
Berkin
declared
he
loved
a
joke
as
well
as
another
;
but
asked
if
any
of
the
company
could
tell
where
Mr
Cropdale
lodged
,
that
he
might
send
him
a
proposal
about
restitution
,
before
the
boots
should
be
made
away
with
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
willingly
give
him
a
pair
of
new
shoes
,
(
said
he
)
and
half
a
guinea
into
the
bargain
,
for
the
boots
,
which
fitted
me
like
a
glove
,
and
I
sha
n't
be
able
to
get
the
fellows
of
them
till
the
good
weather
for
riding
is
over

<EOS>
The
stuttering
wit
declared
,
that
the
only
secret
which
Cropdale
ever
kept
,
was
the
place
of
his
lodgings
;
but
,
he
believed
,
that
during
the
heats
of
summer
,
he
commonly
took
his
repose
upon
a
bulk
,
or
indulged
himself
in
fresco
with
one
of
the
kennel
-
nymphs
,
under
the
portico
of
St.
Martin
's
church
.
"
<EOS>
Pox
on
him
(
cried
the
bookseller
)
<EOS>
he
might
as
well
have
taken
my
whip
and
spurs
 
In
that
case
,
he
might
have
been
tempted
to
steal
another
horse
,
and
then
he
would
have
rid
to
the
devil
of
course
.
"
    
<EOS>
After
coffee
I
took
my
leave
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
with
proper
acknowledgments
of
his
civility
,
and
was
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
entertainment
of
the
day
,
though
not
yet
satisfied
with
respect
to
the
nature
of
this
connexion
betwixt
a
man
of
character
in
the
literary
world
,
and
a
parcel
of
authorlings
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
would
never
be
able
to
acquire
any
degree
of
reputation
by
their
labours
.
<EOS>
On
this
head
I
interrogated
my
conductor
,
Dick
Ivy
,
who
answered
me
to
this
effect
:
"
One
would
imagine
S
#
#
#
#
had
some
view
to
his
own
interest
in
giving
countenance
and
assistance
to
those
people
,
whom
he
knows
to
be
bad
men
,
as
well
as
bad
writers
;
but
,
if
he
has
any
such
view
,
he
will
find
himself
disappointed
;
for
if
he
is
so
vain
as
to
imagine
he
can
make
them
subservient
to
his
schemes
of
profit
or
ambition
,
they
are
cunning
enough
to
make
him
their
property
in
the
mean
time
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
one
of
the
company
you
have
seen
to
-
day
(
myself
excepted
)
<EOS>
who
does
not
owe
him
particular
obligations
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
them
he
bailed
out
of
a
spunging
-
house
,
and
afterwards
paid
the
debt
 
another
he
translated
into
his
family
,
and
cloathed
,
when
he
was
turned
out
half
-
naked
from
gaol
in
consequence
of
an
act
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtors
 
<EOS>
a
third
,
who
was
reduced
to
a
woollen
night
-
cap
,
and
lived
upon
sheep's
-
trotters
,
up
three
pair
of
stairs
backward
in
Butcher
-
row
<EOS>
,
he
took
into
present
pay
and
free
quarters
,
and
enabled
him
to
appear
as
a
gentleman
,
without
having
the
fear
of
sheriff
's
officers
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Those
who
are
in
distress
he
supplies
with
money
when
he
has
it
,
and
with
his
credit
when
he
is
out
of
cash
.
<EOS>
When
they
want
business
,
he
either
finds
employment
for
them
in
his
own
service
,
or
recommends
them
to
booksellers
to
execute
some
project
he
has
formed
for
their
subsistence
.
<EOS>
They
are
always
welcome
to
his
table
,
(
which
,
though
plain
,
is
plentiful
)
and
to
his
good
offices
as
far
as
they
will
go
;
and
when
they
see
occasion
,
they
make
use
of
his
name
with
the
most
petulant
familiarity
;
<EOS>
nay
,
they
do
not
even
scruple
to
arrogate
to
themselves
the
merit
of
some
of
his
performances
,
and
have
been
known
to
sell
their
own
lucubrations
as
the
produce
of
his
brain
.
<EOS>
The
Scotchman
you
saw
at
dinner
once
personated
him
at
an
ale
-
house
in
West
-
Smithfield
,
and
,
in
the
character
of
S
#
#
#
#
,
had
his
head
broke
by
a
cow
-
keeper
,
for
having
spoke
disrespectfully
of
the
Christian
religion
;
but
he
took
the
law
of
him
in
his
own
person
,
and
the
assailant
was
fain
to
give
him
ten
pounds
to
withdraw
his
action
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
observed
,
that
all
this
appearance
of
liberality
on
the
side
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
was
easily
accounted
for
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
flattered
him
in
private
,
and
engaged
his
adversaries
in
public
;
and
yet
I
was
astonished
,
when
I
recollected
that
I
often
had
seen
this
writer
virulently
abused
in
papers
,
poems
,
and
pamphlets
,
and
not
a
pen
was
drawn
in
his
defence
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
be
more
astonished
(
said
he
)
when
I
assure
you
,
those
very
guests
whom
you
saw
at
his
table
to
-
day
,
were
the
authors
of
great
part
of
that
abuse
;
and
he
himself
is
well
aware
of
their
particular
favours
,
for
they
are
all
eager
to
detect
and
betray
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
doing
the
devil
's
work
for
nothing
(
cried
I.
)
<EOS>
What
should
induce
them
to
revile
their
benefactor
without
provocation
?
"
<EOS>
"
Envy
(
answered
Dick
)
is
the
general
incitement
;
but
they
are
galled
by
an
additional
scourge
of
provocation
.
<EOS>
S
#
#
#
#
directs
a
literary
journal
,
in
which
their
productions
are
necessarily
brought
to
trial
;
and
though
many
of
them
have
been
treated
with
such
lenity
and
favour
as
they
little
deserved
,
yet
the
slightest
censure
,
such
as
,
perhaps
,
could
not
be
avoided
with
any
pretensions
to
candour
and
impartiality
,
has
rankled
in
the
hearts
of
those
authors
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
have
taken
immediate
vengeance
on
the
critic
in
anonymous
libels
,
letters
,
and
lampoons
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
all
the
writers
of
the
age
,
good
,
bad
,
and
indifferent
,
from
the
moment
he
assumed
this
office
,
became
his
enemies
,
either
professed
or
in
petto
,
except
those
of
his
friends
who
knew
they
had
nothing
to
fear
from
his
strictures
;
and
he
must
be
a
wiser
man
than
me
,
who
can
tell
what
advantage
or
satisfaction
he
derives
from
having
brought
such
a
nest
of
hornets
about
his
ears
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
owned
,
that
was
a
point
which
might
deserve
consideration
;
but
still
I
expressed
a
desire
to
know
his
real
motives
for
continuing
his
friendship
to
a
set
of
rascals
equally
ungrateful
and
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
did
not
pretend
to
assign
any
reasonable
motive
;
that
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
the
man
was
,
in
point
of
conduct
,
a
most
incorrigible
fool
;
that
,
though
he
pretended
to
have
a
knack
at
hitting
off
characters
,
he
blundered
strangely
in
the
distribution
of
his
favours
,
which
were
generally
bestowed
on
the
most
undeserving
of
those
who
had
recourse
to
his
assistance
;
that
,
indeed
,
this
preference
was
not
so
much
owing
to
want
of
discernment
as
to
want
of
resolution
,
for
he
had
not
fortitude
enough
to
resist
the
importunity
even
of
the
most
worthless
;
and
,
as
he
did
not
know
the
value
of
money
,
there
was
very
little
merit
in
parting
with
it
so
easily
:
that
his
pride
was
gratified
in
seeing
himself
courted
by
such
a
number
of
literary
dependants
;
that
,
probably
,
he
delighted
in
hearing
them
expose
and
traduce
one
another
;
and
,
finally
,
from
their
information
,
he
became
acquainted
with
all
the
transactions
of
Grub
-
street
,
which
he
had
some
thoughts
of
compiling
,
for
the
entertainment
of
the
public
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
suspecting
,
from
Dick
's
discourse
,
that
he
had
some
particular
grudge
against
S
#
#
#
#
,
upon
whose
conduct
he
had
put
the
worst
construction
it
would
bear
;
and
,
by
dint
of
cross
-
examination
<EOS>
,
I
found
he
was
not
at
all
satisfied
with
the
character
which
had
been
given
in
the
Review
of
his
last
performance
,
though
it
had
been
treated
civilly
,
in
consequence
of
the
author
's
application
to
the
critic
.
<EOS>
By
all
accounts
,
S
#
#
#
#
is
not
without
weakness
and
caprice
;
but
he
is
certainly
good
-
humoured
and
civilized
;
nor
do
I
find
,
that
there
is
any
thing
over
-
bearing
,
cruel
,
or
implacable
in
his
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
dwelt
so
long
upon
authors
,
that
you
will
perhaps
suspect
I
intend
to
enroll
myself
among
the
fraternity
;
but
,
if
I
were
actually
qualified
for
the
profession
,
it
is
at
best
but
a
desperate
resource
against
starving
,
as
it
affords
no
provision
for
old
age
and
infirmity
.

MY
DEAR
LETTY
,
THERE
is
something
on
my
spirits
,
which
I
should
not
venture
to
communicate
by
the
post
,
but
having
the
opportunity
of
Mrs
Brentwood
's
return
,
I
seize
it
eagerly
,
to
disburden
my
poor
heart
,
which
is
oppressed
with
fear
and
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
O
Letty
!
<EOS>
what
a
miserable
situation
it
is
,
to
be
without
a
friend
to
whom
one
can
apply
for
counsel
and
consolation
in
distress
!
<EOS>
I
hinted
in
my
last
,
that
one
Mr
Barton
had
been
very
particular
in
his
civilities
:
<EOS>
I
can
no
longer
mistake
his
meaning
 
<EOS>
he
has
formally
professed
himself
my
admirer
;
and
,
after
a
thousand
assiduities
,
perceiving
I
made
but
a
cold
return
to
his
addresses
,
he
had
recourse
to
the
mediation
of
lady
Griskin
,
who
has
acted
the
part
of
a
very
warm
advocate
in
his
behalf
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
my
dear
Willis
,
her
ladyship
overacts
her
part
 
<EOS>
she
not
only
expatiates
on
the
ample
fortune
,
the
great
connexions
,
and
the
unblemished
character
of
Mr
Barton
,
but
she
takes
the
trouble
to
catechise
me
;
and
,
two
days
ago
,
peremptorily
told
me
,
that
a
girl
of
my
age
could
not
possibly
resist
so
many
considerations
,
if
her
heart
was
not
pre
-
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
This
insinuation
threw
me
into
such
a
flutter
,
that
she
could
not
but
observe
my
disorder
;
and
,
presuming
upon
the
discovery
,
insisted
upon
my
making
her
the
confidante
of
my
passion
.
<EOS>
But
,
although
I
had
not
such
command
of
myself
as
to
conceal
the
emotion
of
my
heart
,
I
am
not
such
a
child
as
to
disclose
its
secrets
to
a
person
who
would
certainly
use
them
to
its
prejudice
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
it
was
no
wonder
if
I
was
out
of
countenance
,
at
her
introducing
a
subject
of
conversation
so
unsuitable
to
my
years
and
inexperience
;
that
I
believed
Mr
Barton
was
a
very
worthy
gentleman
,
and
I
was
much
obliged
to
him
for
his
good
opinion
;
but
the
affections
were
involuntary
,
and
mine
,
in
particular
,
had
as
yet
made
no
concessions
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
She
shook
her
head
with
an
air
of
distrust
that
made
me
tremble
;
and
observed
,
that
if
my
affections
were
free
,
they
would
submit
to
the
decision
of
prudence
,
especially
when
enforced
by
the
authority
of
those
who
had
a
right
to
direct
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
This
remark
implied
a
design
to
interest
my
uncle
or
my
aunt
,
perhaps
my
brother
,
in
behalf
of
Mr
Barton
's
passion
;
and
I
am
sadly
afraid
that
my
aunt
is
already
gained
over
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
in
the
afternoon
,
he
had
been
walking
with
us
in
the
Park
,
and
stopping
in
our
return
at
a
toyshop
,
he
presented
her
with
a
very
fine
snuff
-
box
,
and
me
with
a
gold
etuis
,
which
I
resolutely
refused
,
till
she
commanded
me
to
accept
it
on
pain
of
her
displeasure
:
nevertheless
,
being
still
unsatisfied
with
respect
to
the
propriety
of
receiving
this
toy
,
I
signified
my
doubts
to
my
brother
,
who
said
he
would
consult
my
uncle
on
the
subject
,
and
seemed
to
think
Mr
Barton
had
been
rather
premature
in
his
presents
.
    
<EOS>
What
will
be
the
result
of
this
consultation
,
Heaven
knows
;
but
I
am
afraid
it
will
produce
an
explanation
with
Mr
Barton
,
who
will
,
no
doubt
,
avow
his
passion
,
and
solicit
their
consent
to
a
connexion
which
my
soul
abhors
;
for
,
my
dearest
Letty
,
it
is
not
in
my
power
to
love
Mr
Barton
,
even
if
my
heart
was
untouched
by
any
other
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Not
that
there
is
any
thing
disagreeable
about
his
person
,
but
there
is
a
total
want
of
that
nameless
charm
whice
captivates
and
controls
the
inchanted
spirit
 
<EOS>
at
least
,
he
appears
to
me
to
have
this
defect
;
but
if
he
had
all
the
engaging
qualifications
which
a
man
can
possess
,
they
would
be
excited
in
vain
against
that
constancy
,
which
,
I
flatter
myself
,
is
the
characteristic
of
my
nature
.
<EOS>
No
,
my
dear
Willis
,
I
may
be
involved
in
fresh
troubles
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
,
from
the
importunities
of
this
gentleman
and
the
violence
of
my
relations
;
but
my
heart
is
incapable
of
change
.
    
<EOS>
You
know
,
I
put
no
faith
in
dreams
;
and
yet
I
have
been
much
disturbed
by
one
that
visited
me
last
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
in
a
church
,
where
a
certain
person
,
whom
you
know
,
was
on
the
point
of
being
married
to
my
aunt
;
that
the
clergyman
was
Mr
Barton
,
and
that
poor
forlorn
I
stood
weeping
in
a
corner
,
half
naked
,
and
without
shoes
or
stockings

Now
,
I
know
there
is
nothing
so
childish
as
to
be
moved
by
those
vain
illusions
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
in
spite
of
all
my
reason
,
this
hath
made
a
strong
impression
upon
my
mind
,
which
begins
to
be
very
gloomy
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
have
another
more
substantial
cause
of
affliction
 
I
have
some
religious
scruples
,
my
dear
friend
,
which
lie
heavy
on
my
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
persuaded
to
go
to
the
Tabernacle
,
where
I
heard
a
discourse
that
affected
me
deeply
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
prayed
fervently
to
be
enlightened
,
but
as
yet
I
am
not
sensible
of
these
inward
motions
,
those
operations
of
grace
,
which
are
the
signs
of
a
regenerated
spirit
;
and
therefore
I
begin
to
be
in
terrible
apprehensions
about
the
state
of
my
poor
soul
.
<EOS>
Some
of
our
family
have
had
very
uncommon
accessions
,
particularly
my
aunt
and
Mrs
Jenkins
,
who
sometimes
speak
as
if
they
were
really
inspired
;
so
that
I
am
not
like
to
want
for
either
exhortation
or
example
,
to
purify
my
thoughts
,
and
recall
them
from
the
vanities
of
this
world
,
which
,
indeed
,
I
would
willingly
resign
,
if
it
was
in
my
power
;
but
to
make
this
sacrifice
,
I
must
be
enabled
by
such
assistance
from
above
as
hath
not
yet
been
indulged
to
.

unfortunate
friend

Sir

<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
<EOS>
THE
moment
I
received
your
letter
,
I
began
to
execute
your
commission
 
With
the
assistance
of
mine
host
at
the
Bull
and
Gate
,
I
discovered
the
place
to
which
your
fugitive
valet
had
retreated
,
and
taxed
him
with
his
dishonesty
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
was
in
manifest
confusion
at
sight
of
me
,
but
he
denied
the
charge
with
great
confidence
,
till
I
told
him
,
that
if
he
would
give
up
the
watch
which
was
a
family
piece
,
he
might
keep
the
money
and
the
clothes
,
and
go
to
the
devil
his
own
way
,
at
his
leisure
;
but
if
he
rejected
this
proposal
,
I
would
deliver
him
forthwith
to
the
constable
,
whom
I
had
provided
for
that
purpose
,
and
he
would
carry
him
before
the
justice
without
further
delay
.
<EOS>
After
some
hesitation
,
he
desired
to
speak
with
me
in
the
next
room
,
where
he
produced
the
watch
,
with
all
its
appendages
,
and
I
have
delivered
it
to
our
landlord
,
to
be
sent
you
by
the
first
safe
conveyance
 
So
much
for
business
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
grow
vain
,
upon
your
saying
you
find
entertainment
in
my
letters
;
barren
,
as
they
certainly
late
,
of
incident
and
importance
,
because
your
amusement
must
arise
,
not
from
the
matter
,
but
from
the
manner
,
which
you
know
is
all
my
own
 
Animated
,
therefore
,
by
the
approbation
of
a
person
,
whose
nice
taste
and
consummate
judgment
<EOS>
I
can
no
longer
doubt
,
I
will
chearfully
proceed
with
our
memoirs
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
determined
we
shall
set
out
next
week
for
Yorkshire
,
I
went
to
-
day
in
the
forenoon
with
my
uncle
to
see
a
carriage
,
belonging
to
a
coachmaker
in
our
neighbourhood
 
Turning
down
a
narrow
lane
,
behind
Long
-
acre
,
we
perceived
a
crowd
of
people
standing
at
a
door
;
which
,
it
seems
,
opened
into
a
kind
of
a
methodist
meeting
,
and
were
informed
,
that
a
footman
was
then
holding
forth
to
the
congregation
within
.
<EOS>
Curious
to
see
this
phenomenon
,
we
squeezed
into
the
place
with
much
difficulty
;
and
who
should
this
preacher
be
,
but
<EOS>
the
identical
Humphry
Clinker
.
<EOS>
He
had
finished
his
sermon
,
and
given
out
a
psalm
,
the
first
stave
of
which
he
sung
with
peculiar
graces
 
<EOS>
But
if
we
were
astonished
to
see
Clinker
in
the
pulpit
,
we
were
altogether
confounded
at
finding
all
the
females
of
our
family
among
the
audience
 
<EOS>
There
was
lady
Griskin
,
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
my
sister
Liddy
,
and
Mr
Barton
,
and
all
of
them
joined
in
the
psalmody
,
with
strong
marks
of
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
keep
my
gravity
on
this
ludicrous
occasion
;
but
old
Square
-
toes
was
differently
affected
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
struck
him
,
was
the
presumption
of
his
lacquey
,
whom
he
commanded
to
come
down
,
with
such
an
air
of
authority
as
Humphry
did
not
think
proper
to
disregard
.
<EOS>
He
descended
immediately
,
and
all
the
people
were
in
commotion
.
<EOS>
Barton
looked
exceedingly
sheepish
,
lady
Griskin
flirted
her
fan
,
Mrs
Tabby
groaned
in
spirit
,
Liddy
changed
countenance
,
and
Mrs
Jenkins
sobbed
as
if
her
heart
was
breaking
 
My
uncle
,
with
a
sneer
,
asked
pardon
of
the
ladies
,
for
having
interrupted
their
devotion
,
saying
,
he
had
particular
business
with
the
preacher
,
whom
he
ordered
to
call
a
hackney
-
coach
.
<EOS>
This
being
immediately
brought
up
to
the
end
of
the
lane
,
he
handed
Liddy
into
it
,
and
my
aunt
and
<EOS>
I
following
him
<EOS>
,
we
drove
home
,
without
taking
any
further
notice
of
the
rest
of
the
company
,
who
still
remained
in
silent
astonishment
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
perceiving
Liddy
in
great
trepidation
,
assumed
a
milder
aspect
,
bidding
her
be
under
no
concern
,
for
he
was
not
at
all
displeased
at
any
thing
she
had
done
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
(
said
he
)
to
your
being
religiously
inclined
;
but
I
do
n't
think
my
servant
is
a
proper
ghostly
director
,
for
a
devotee
of
your
sex
and
character
  
if
,
in
fact
,
(
as
I
rather
believe
)
<EOS>
your
aunt
is
not
the
sole
conductress
of
this
machine
 
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Tabitha
made
no
answer
,
but
threw
up
the
whites
of
her
eyes
,
as
if
in
the
act
of
ejaculation
 
<EOS>
Poor
Liddy
said
she
had
no
right
to
the
title
of
a
devotee
;
that
she
thought
there
was
no
harm
in
hearing
a
pious
discourse
,
even
if
it
came
from
a
footman
,
especially
as
her
aunt
was
present
;
but
that
if
she
had
erred
from
ignorance
,
she
hoped
he
would
excuse
it
,
as
she
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
living
under
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
,
pressing
her
hand
with
a
tender
smile
,
said
she
was
a
good
girl
,
and
that
he
did
not
believe
her
capable
of
doing
any
thing
that
could
give
him
the
least
umbrage
or
disgust
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
our
lodgings
,
he
commanded
Mr
Clinker
to
attend
him
up
stairs
,
and
spoke
to
him
in
these
words
 
"
Since
you
are
called
upon
by
the
spirit
to
preach
and
to
teach
,
it
is
high
time
to
lay
aside
the
livery
of
an
earthly
master
;
and
,
for
my
part
,
I
am
unworthy
to
have
an
apostle
in
my
service
 
"
"
I
hope
(
said
Humphry
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
failed
in
my
duty
to
your
honour
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
a
vile
wretch
if
I
did
,
considering
the
misery
from
which
your
charity
and
compassion
relieved
me
 
but
having
an
inward
admonition
of
the
spirit
 
<EOS>
"
"
An
admonition
of
the
devil
 
(
cried
the
"
squire
,
in
a
passion
)
<EOS>
What
admonition
,
you
blockhead
?
  
<EOS>
What
right
has
such
a
fellow
as
you
to
set
up
for
a
reformer
?
"
<EOS>
"
Begging
your
honour
's
pardon
,
(
replied
Clinker
)
may
not
the
new
light
of
God
's
grace
shine
upon
the
poor
and
the
ignorant
in
their
humility
,
as
well
as
upon
the
wealthy
,
and
the
philosopher
in
all
his
pride
of
human
learning
?
"
<EOS>
"
What
you
imagine
to
be
the
new
light
of
grace
,
(
said
his
master
)
<EOS>
I
take
to
be
a
deceitful
vapour
,
glimmering
through
a
crack
in
your
upper
story
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
Mr
Clinker
,
I
will
have
no
light
in
my
family
but
what
pays
the
king
's
taxes
,
unless
it
be
the
light
of
reason
,
which
you
do
n't
pretend
to
follow
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Humphry
)
<EOS>
the
light
of
reason
is
no
more
,
in
comparison
to
the
light
I
mean
,
than
a
farthing
candle
to
the
sun
at
noon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Very
true
,
(
said
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
the
one
will
serve
to
shew
you
your
way
,
and
the
other
to
dazzle
and
confound
your
weak
brain
 
Hark
-
ye
,
Clinker
,
you
are
either
an
hypocritical
knave
,
or
a
wrong
-
headed
enthusiast
;
and
,
in
either
case
,
unfit
for
my
service
 
<EOS>
If
you
are
a
quack
in
sanctity
and
devotion
,
you
will
find
it
an
easy
matter
to
impose
upon
silly
women
,
and
others
of
crazed
understanding
,
who
will
contribute
lavishly
for
your
support
 
if
you
are
really
seduced
by
the
reveries
of
a
disturbed
imagination
,
the
sooner
you
lose
your
senses
entirely
,
the
better
for
yourself
and
the
community
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
some
charitable
person
might
provide
you
with
a
dark
room
and
clean
straw
in
Bedlam
,
where
it
would
not
be
in
your
power
to
infect
others
with
your
fanaticism
;
whereas
,
if
you
have
just
reflection
enough
left
to
maintain
the
character
of
a
chosen
vessel
in
the
meetings
of
the
godly
,
you
and
your
hearers
will
be
misled
by
a
Will
-
i'the
-
wisp
,
from
one
error
into
another
,
till
you
are
plunged
into
religious
frenzy
;
and
then
,
perhaps
,
you
will
hang
yourself
in
despair
 
"
"
<EOS>
Which
the
lord
of
his
infinite
mercy
forbid
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
affrighted
Clinker
.
)
<EOS>
It
is
very
possible
<EOS>
I
may
be
under
the
temptation
of
the
devil
,
who
wants
to
wreck
me
on
the
rocks
of
spiritual
pride
 
<EOS>
Your
honour
says
,
I
am
either
a
knave
or
a
madman
;
now
,
as
I
'll
assure
your
honour
I
am
no
knave
,
it
follows
that
I
must
be
mad
;
therefore
,
I
beseech
your
honour
,
upon
my
knees
,
to
take
my
case
into
consideration
<EOS>
,
that
means
my
be
used
for
my
recovery
 
"
    
The
"
squire
could
not
help
smiling
at
the
poor
fellow
's
simplicity
,
and
promised
to
take
care
of
him
,
provided
he
would
mind
the
business
of
his
place
,
without
running
after
the
new
light
of
Methodism
:
<EOS>
but
Mrs
Tabitha
took
offence
at
his
humility
,
which
she
interpreted
into
poorness
of
spirit
and
worldly
mindedness
.
  
<EOS>
She
upbraided
him
with
the
want
of
courage
to
suffer
for
conscience
sake
;
she
observed
,
that
if
he
should
lose
his
place
for
bearing
testimony
to
the
truth
,
Providence
would
not
fail
to
find
him
another
,
perhaps
more
advantageous
;
and
,
declaring
that
it
could
not
be
very
agreeable
to
live
in
a
family
where
an
inquisition
was
established
,
retired
to
another
room
in
great
agitation
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
followed
her
with
a
significant
look
;
then
,
turning
to
the
preacher
,
"
You
hear
what
my
sister
says
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
live
with
me
upon
such
terms
as
I
have
prescribed
,
the
vineyard
of
Methodism
lies
before
you
,
and
she
seems
very
well
disposed
to
reward
your
labour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
willingly
give
offence
to
any
soul
upon
earth
(
answered
Humphry
)
;
her
ladyship
has
been
very
good
to
me
,
ever
since
we
came
to
London
;
and
surely
she
has
a
heart
turned
for
religious
exercises
,
and
both
she
and
lady
Griskin
sing
psalms
and
hymns
like
two
cherubims
:
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
I
'm
bound
to
love
and
obey
your
honour
.
  
<EOS>
It
becometh
not
such
a
poor
ignorant
fellow
as
me
to
hold
dispute
with
gentlemen
of
rank
and
learning
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
matter
of
knowledge
,
I
am
no
more
than
a
beast
in
comparison
of
your
honour
;
therefore
I
submit
,
and
,
with
God
's
grace
,
I
will
follow
you
to
the
world
's
end
,
if
you
do
n't
think
me
too
far
gone
to
be
out
of
confinement
.
"
    
<EOS>
His
master
promised
to
keep
him
for
some
time
longer
on
trial
;
then
desired
to
know
in
what
manner
lady
Griskin
and
Mr
Barton
came
to
join
their
religious
society
.
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
that
her
ladyship
was
the
person
who
first
carried
my
aunt
and
sister
to
the
tabernacle
,
whither
he
attended
them
,
and
had
his
devotion
kindled
by
Mr
W
#
#
#
#
's
preaching
:
that
he
was
confirmed
in
this
new
way
by
the
preacher
's
sermons
,
which
he
had
bought
and
studied
with
great
attention
:
that
his
discourse
and
prayers
had
brought
over
Mrs
Jenkins
and
the
house
-
maid
to
the
same
way
of
thinking
;
but
as
for
Mr
Barton
,
he
had
never
seen
him
at
service
before
this
day
,
when
he
came
in
company
with
<EOS>
lady
Griskin
 
Humphry
moreover
owned
,
that
he
had
been
encouraged
to
mount
the
rostrum
by
the
example
and
success
of
a
weaver
,
who
was
much
followed
as
a
powerful
minister
:
that
on
his
first
trial
,
he
found
himself
under
such
strong
impulsions
,
as
made
him
believe
he
was
certainly
moved
by
the
Spirit
;
and
that
he
had
assisted
in
lady
Griskin
's
,
and
several
private
houses
,
at
exercises
of
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
was
no
sooner
informed
that
her
ladyship
had
acted
as
the
primum
mobile
of
this
confederacy
,
than
he
concluded
she
had
only
made
use
of
Clinker
as
a
tool
,
subservient
to
the
execution
of
some
design
,
to
the
true
secret
of
which
he
was
an
utter
stranger
 
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
her
ladyship
's
brain
was
a
perfect
mill
for
projects
;
and
that
she
and
Tabby
had
certainly
engaged
in
some
secret
treaty
,
the
nature
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
I
thought
it
was
no
difficult
matter
to
perceive
the
drift
of
Mrs
Tabitha
,
which
was
to
ensnare
the
heart
of
Barton
,
and
that
in
all
likelihood
my
lady
Griskin
acted
as
her
auxiliary
:
that
this
supposition
would
account
for
their
endeavours
to
convert
him
to
Methodism
;
an
event
which
would
occasion
a
connexion
of
souls
that
might
be
easily
improved
into
a
matrimonial
union

My
uncle
seemed
to
be
much
diverted
by
the
thoughts
of
this
scheme
's
succeeding
;
but
I
gave
him
to
understand
that
Barton
was
pre
-
engaged
:
that
he
had
the
day
before
made
a
present
of
an
etuis
to
Liddy
,
which
her
aunt
had
obliged
her
to
receive
,
with
a
view
,
no
doubt
,
to
countenance
her
own
accepting
of
a
snuff
-
box
at
the
same
time
:
that
my
sister
having
made
me
acquainted
with
this
incident
,
I
had
desired
an
explanation
of
Mr
Barton
,
who
declared
his
intentions
were
honourable
,
and
expressed
his
hope
that
I
would
have
no
objections
to
his
alliance
:
that
I
had
thanked
him
for
the
honour
he
intended
our
family
;
but
told
him
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
consult
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
who
were
her
guardians
,
and
their
approbation
being
obtained
,
I
could
have
no
objection
to
his
proposal
;
though
I
was
persuaded
that
no
violence
would
be
offered
to
my
sister
's
inclinations
,
in
a
transaction
that
so
nearly
interested
the
happiness
of
her
future
life
:
that
he
had
assured
me
,
he
should
never
think
of
availing
himself
of
a
guardian
's
authority
,
unless
he
could
render
his
addresses
agreeable
to
the
young
lady
herself
;
and
that
he
would
immediately
demand
permission
of
Mr
and
Miss
Bramble
to
make
Liddy
a
tender
of
his
hand
and
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
The
"
squire
was
not
insensible
to
the
advantages
of
such
a
match
,
and
declared
he
would
promote
it
with
all
his
influence
;
but
when
I
took
notice
that
there
seemed
to
be
an
aversion
on
the
side
of
Liddy
,
he
said
he
would
found
her
on
the
subject
;
and
if
her
reluctance
was
such
as
would
not
be
easily
overcome
,
he
would
civilly
decline
the
proposal
of
Mr
Barton
:
for
he
thought
that
,
in
the
choice
of
a
husband
,
a
young
woman
ought
not
to
sacrifice
the
feelings
of
her
heart
for
any
considerations
upon
earth
 
<EOS>
"
Liddy
is
not
so
desperate
(
said
he
)
as
to
worship
fortune
at
such
an
expence
.
<EOS>
"
I
take
it
for
granted
this
whole
affair
will
end
in
smoke
;
though
there
seems
to
be
a
storm
brewing
in
the
quarter
of
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
sat
with
all
the
sullen
dignity
of
silence
at
dinner
,
seemingly
pregnant
with
complaint
and
expostulation
.
<EOS>
As
she
hath
certainly
marked
Barton
for
her
own
prey
,
she
can
not
possibly
favour
his
suit
to
Liddy
,
and
therefore
I
expect
something
extraordinary
will
attend
his
declaring
himself
my
sister
's
admirer
.
<EOS>
This
declaration
will
certainly
be
made
in
form
,
as
soon
as
the
lover
can
pick
up
resolution
enough
to
stand
the
brunt
of
Mrs
Tabby
's
disappointment
;
for
he
is
,
without
doubt
,
aware
of
her
designs
upon
his
person
.
  
<EOS>
The
particulars
of
the
denouement
you
shall
know
in
due
season
:

while
I
am

London

<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Lewis
,
THE
deceitful
calm
was
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
I
am
plunged
again
in
a
sea
of
vexation
,
and
the
complaints
in
my
stomach
and
bowels
are
returned
;
so
that
I
suppose
I
shall
be
disabled
from
prosecuting
the
excursion
I
had
planned
 
What
the
devil
had
I
to
do
,
to
come
a
plague
hunting
with
a
leash
of
females
in
my
train
?
<EOS>
Yesterday
my
precious
sister
(
who
by
the
bye
,
has
been
for
some
time
a
professed
Methodist
)
came
into
my
apartment
,
attended
by
Mr
Barton
,
and
desired
an
audience
with
a
very
stately
air
 
<EOS>
"
Brother
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
this
gentleman
has
something
to
propose
,
which
I
flatter
my
self
,
will
be
the
more
acceptable
,
as
it
will
rid
you
of
a
troublesome
companion
.
"
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Barton
proceeded
to
this
effect
 
"
I
am
,
indeed
,
extremely
ambitious
of
being
allied
to
your
family
,
Mr
Bramble
,
and
I
hope
you
will
see
no
cause
to
interpose
your
authority
.
"
<EOS>
"
As
for
authority
(
said
Tabby
,
interrupting
him
with
some
warmth
)
<EOS>
I
know
of
none
that
he
has
a
right
to
use
on
this
occasion
 
<EOS>
If
I
pay
him
the
compliment
of
making
him
acquainted
with
the
step
I
intend
to
take
,
it
is
all
he
can
expect
in
reason
 
<EOS>
This
is
as
much
as
I
believe
he
would
do
by
me
,
if
he
intended
to
change
his
own
situation
in
life
 
In
a
word
,
brother
,
I
am
so
sensible
of
Mr
Barton
's
extraordinary
merit
,
that
I
have
been
prevailed
upon
to
alter
my
resolution
of
living
a
single
life
,
and
to
put
my
happiness
in
his
hands
,
by
vesting
him
with
a
legal
title
to
my
person
and
fortune
,
such
as
they
are
.
<EOS>
The
business
at
present
,
is
to
have
the
writings
drawn
;
and
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you
,
if
you
will
recommend
a
lawyer
to
me
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
"
    
You
may
guess
what
an
effect
this
overture
had
upon
me
,
who
,
from
the
information
of
my
nephew
,
expected
that
Barton
was
to
make
a
formal
declaration
of
his
passion
for
Liddy
;
I
could
not
help
gazing
in
silent
astonishment
,
alternately
at
Tabby
and
her
supposed
admirer
,
which
last
hung
his
head
in
the
most
aukward
confusion
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
retired
,
on
pretence
of
being
suddenly
seized
with
a
vertigo
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
affected
much
concern
,
and
would
have
had
him
make
use
of
a
bed
in
the
house
;
but
he
insisted
upon
going
home
,
that
he
might
have
recourse
to
some
drops
,
which
he
kept
for
such
emergencies
,
and
his
inamorata
acquiesced
,
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
I
was
exceedingly
puzzled
at
this
adventure
(
tho
'
I
suspected
the
truth
)
and
did
not
know
in
what
manner
to
demean
myself
towards
Mrs
Tabitha
,
when
Jery
came
in
and
told
me
,
he
had
just
seen
Mr
Barton
alight
from
his
chariot
at
lady
Griskin
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
incident
seemed
,
to
threaten
a
visit
from
her
ladyship
,
with
which
we
were
honoured
accordingly
in
less
than
half
an
hour
 
<EOS>
"
I
find
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
there
has
been
a
match
of
cross
purposes
among
you
,
good
folks
;
and
I
'm
come
to
set
you
to
rights
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
presented
me
with
the
folowling
billet
:
    
<EOS>
"
Dear
Sir
,
I
no
sooner
recollected
myself
from
the
extreme
confusion
I
was
thrown
into
,
by
that
unlucky
mistake
of
your
sister
,
than
I
thought
it
my
duty
to
assure
you
,
that
my
devoirs
to
Mrs
Bramble
never
exceeded
the
bounds
of
ordinary
civility
,
and
that
my
heart
is
unalterably
fixed
upon
Miss
Liddy
Melford
,
as
I
had
the
honour
to
declare
to
her
brother
,
when
he
questioned
me
upon
that
subject
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
has
been
so
good
as
to
charge
herself
,
not
only
with
the
delivery
of
this
note
,
but
also
with
the
task
of
undeceiving
Mrs
Bramdle
,
for
whom
I
have
the
most
profound
respect
and
veneration
,
tho
'
<EOS>
my
affection
being
otherwise
engaged
,
is
no
longer
in
the
power
of
,
Sir
,
    
"
Your
very
humble
Servant
,
Ralph
Barton
.
"
    
<EOS>
Having
cast
my
eyes
over
this
billet
,
I
told
her
ladyship
that
I
would
no
longer
retard
the
friendly
office
she
had
undertaken
;
and
I
and
Jery
forthwith
retired
into
another
room
.
<EOS>
There
we
soon
perceived
the
conversation
grow
very
warm
betwixt
the
two
ladies
;
and
,
at
length
,
could
distinctly
hear
certain
terms
of
altercation
,
which
we
could
no
longer
delay
interrupting
,
with
any
regard
to
decorum
.
<EOS>
When
we
entered
the
scene
of
contention
,
we
found
Liddy
had
joined
the
disputants
,
and
stood
trembling
betwixt
them
,
as
is
if
she
had
been
afraid
they
would
have
proceeded
to
something
more
practicable
than
words
 
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
's
face
was
like
the
full
moon
in
a
storm
of
wind
,
glaring
,
fiery
,
and
portentous
;
while
Tabby
looked
grim
and
ghastly
,
with
an
aspect
breathing
discord
and
dismay
.
  
<EOS>
Our
appearance
put
a
stop
to
their
mutual
revilings
;
but
her
ladyship
turning
to
me
,
"
Cousin
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
saying
I
have
met
with
a
very
ungrateful
return
from
this
lady
,
for
the
pains
I
have
taken
to
serve
her
family
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
family
is
much
obliged
to
your
ladyship
,
(
cried
Tabby
,
with
a
kind
of
hysterical
giggle
)
but
we
have
no
right
to
the
good
offices
of
such
an
honourable
go
-
between
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
,
for
all
that
,
good
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
,
(
resumed
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
shall
be
content
with
the
reflection
,
that
virtue
is
its
own
reward
;
and
it
shall
not
be
my
fault
if
you
continue
to
make
yourself
ridiculous
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
who
has
no
little
interest
of
his
own
to
serve
,
will
no
doubt
,
contribute
all
in
his
power
to
promote
a
match
betwixt
Mr
Barton
and
his
niece
,
which
will
be
equally
honourable
and
advantageous
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
Miss
Liddy
herself
will
have
no
objection
to
a
measure
so
well
calculated
to
make
her
happy
in
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
Ladyship
's
pardon
,
(
exclaimed
Liddy
,
with
great
vivacity
)
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
but
misery
to
expect
from
such
a
measure
;
and
I
hope
my
guardians
will
have
too
much
compassion
,
to
barter
my
peace
of
mind
for
any
consideration
of
interest
or
fortune
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
Miss
Liddy
!
<EOS>
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
you
have
profited
by
the
example
of
your
good
aunt
 
<EOS>
I
comprehend
your
meaning
,
and
will
explain
it
when
I
have
a
proper
opportunity
 
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
I
shall
take
my
leave
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
your
most
obedient
,
and
devoted
humble
servant
<EOS>
,
"
said
she
,
advancing
close
up
to
my
sister
,
and
curtsying
so
low
,
that
I
thought
she
intended
to
squat
herself
down
on
the
floor
 
<EOS>
This
salutation
Tabby
returned
with
equal
solemnity
;
and
the
expression
of
the
two
faces
,
while
they
continued
in
this
attitude
,
would
be
no
bad
subject
for
a
pencil
like
that
of
the
incomparable
Hogarth
,
if
any
such
should
ever
appear
again
,
in
these
times
of
dullness
and
degeneracy
.
    
<EOS>
Jery
accompanied
her
ladyship
to
her
house
,
that
he
might
have
an
opportunity
to
restore
the
etuis
to
Barton
,
and
advise
him
to
give
up
his
suit
,
which
was
so
disagreeable
to
his
sister
,
against
whom
,
however
,
he
returned
much
irritated
.
  
<EOS>
Lady
Griskn
had
assured
him
,
that
Liddy
's
heart
was
pre
-
occupied
;
and
immediately
the
idea
of
Wilson
recurring
to
his
imagination
,
his
family
-
pride
,
took
the
alarm
 
<EOS>
He
denounced
vengeance
against
that
adventurer
,
and
was
disposed
to
be
very
peremptory
with
his
sister
;
but
I
desired
he
would
suppress
his
resentment
,
until
I
should
have
talked
with
her
in
private
.
    
<EOS>
The
poor
girl
,
when
I
earnestly
pressed
her
on
this
head
,
owned
,
with
a
flood
of
tears
,
that
Wilson
had
actually
come
to
the
Hot
Well
at
Bristol
,
and
even
introduced
himself
into
our
lodgings
as
a
Jew
pedler
;
but
that
nothing
had
passed
betwixt
them
,
further
than
her
begging
him
to
withdraw
immediately
,
if
he
had
any
regard
for
her
peace
of
mind
:
that
he
had
disappeared
accordingly
,
after
having
attempted
to
prevail
upon
my
sister
's
maid
to
deliver
a
letter
;
which
,
however
,
she
refused
to
receive
,
though
she
had
consented
to
carry
a
message
,
importing
that
he
was
a
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
and
that
in
a
very
little
time
,
he
would
avow
his
passion
in
that
character
 
<EOS>
She
confessed
,
that
although
he
had
not
kept
his
word
in
this
particular
,
he
was
not
yet
altogether
indifferent
to
her
affection
;
but
solemnly
promised
,
she
would
never
carry
on
any
correspondence
with
him
,
or
any
other
admirer
,
for
the
future
,
without
the
privity
and
approbation
of
her
brother
and
me
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
declaration
,
she
made
her
own
peace
with
Jery
;
but
the
hot
-
headed
boy
is
more
than
ever
incensed
against
Wilson
,
whom
he
now
considers
as
an
impostor
,
that
harbours
some
infamous
design
upon
the
honour
of
his
family
 
<EOS>
As
for
Barton
,
he
was
not
a
little
mortified
to
find
his
present
returned
,
and
his
addresses
so
unfavourably
received
;
but
he
is
not
a
man
to
be
deeply
affected
by
such
disappointments
;
and
I
know
not
whether
he
is
not
as
well
pleased
at
being
discarded
by
Liddy
,
as
he
would
have
been
with
a
permission
to
prosecute
his
pretensions
,
at
the
risque
of
being
every
day
exposed
to
the
revenge
or
machinations
of
Tabby
,
who
is
not
to
be
slighted
with
impunity
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
not
much
time
to
moralize
on
these
occurrences
;
for
the
house
was
visited
by
a
constable
and
his
gang
with
a
warrant
from
justice
Buzzard
,
to
search
the
box
of
Humphry
Clinker
,
my
footman
,
who
was
just
apprehended
as
a
highwayman
 
<EOS>
This
incident
threw
the
whole
family
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
My
sister
scolded
the
constable
for
presuming
to
enter
the
lodgings
of
a
gentleman
on
such
an
errand
,
without
having
first
asked
and
obtained
permission
;
her
maid
was
frightened
into
sits
,
and
Liddy
shed
tears
of
compassion
for
the
unfortunate
Clinker
,
in
whose
box
,
however
,
nothing
was
found
to
confirm
the
suspicion
of
robbery
    
For
my
own
part
,
I
made
no
doubt
of
the
fellow
's
being
mistaken
for
some
other
person
,
and
I
went
directly
to
the
justice
,
in
order
to
procure
his
discharge
;
but
there
I
found
the
matter
much
more
serious
than
I
expected
 
<EOS>
Poor
Clinker
stood
trembling
at
the
bar
,
surrounded
by
thief
-
takers
;
and
,
at
a
little
distance
,
a
thick
,
squat
fellow
,
a
postillion
,
his
accuser
,
who
had
seized
him
in
the
street
,
and
swore
positively
to
his
person
,
that
the
said
Clinker
had
,
on
the
15th
day
of
March
last
,
on
Blackheath
,
robbed
a
gentleman
in
a
postchaise
,
which
he
(
the
postillion
drove
)
 
<EOS>
This
deposition
was
sufficient
to
justify
his
commitment
;
and
he
was
sent
accordingly
to
Clerkenwell
prison
,
whither
Jery
accompanied
him
in
the
coach
,
in
order
to
recommend
him
properly
to
the
keeper
,
that
he
may
want
for
no
convenience
which
the
place
affords
.
    
<EOS>
The
spectators
,
who
assembled
to
see
this
highwayman
,
were
sagacious
enough
to
discern
something
very
villanous
in
his
aspect
,
which
(
begging
their
pardon
)
is
the
very
picture
of
simplicity
;
and
the
justice
himself
put
a
very
unfavourable
construction
upon
some
of
his
answers
which
,
he
said
,
favoured
of
the
ambiguity
and
equivocation
of
an
old
offender
;
but
,
in
my
opinion
,
it
would
have
been
more
just
and
humane
to
impute
them
to
the
confusion
into
which
we
may
suppose
a
poor
country
lad
to
be
thrown
on
such
an
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
am
still
persuaded
he
is
innocent
;
and
in
this
persuasion
,
I
can
do
no
less
than
use
my
utmost
endeavours
that
he
may
not
be
oppressed
 
<EOS>
I
shall
,
to
-
morrow
,
send
my
nephew
to
wait
on
the
gentleman
who
was
robbed
,
and
beg
he
will
have
the
humanity
to
go
and
see
the
prisoner
;
that
in
case
he
should
find
him
quite
different
from
the
person
of
the
highwayman
,
he
may
bear
testimony
in
his
behalf
  
Howsoever
<EOS>
it
may
fare
with
Clinker
,
this
cursed
affair
will
be
to
me
productive
of
intolerable
chagrin
 
<EOS>
I
have
already
caught
a
dreadful
cold
,
by
rushing
into
the
open
air
from
the
justice
's
parlour
,
where
I
had
been
stewing
in
the
crowd
;
and
tho
'
I
should
not
be
laid
up
with
the
gout
,
as
I
believe
I
shall
<EOS>
,
I
must
stay
at
London
for
some
weeks
,
till
this
poor
devil
comes
to
his
trial
at
Rochester
;
so
that
,
in
all
probability
,
my
Northern
expedition
is
blown
up
.
    
<EOS>
If
you
can
find
any
thing
in
your
philosophical
budget
,
to
console
me
in
the
midst
of
these
distresses
and
apprehensions
,
pray
let
it
be
communicated
to
    
Your
unfortunate
friend

DEAR
WAT
,
THE
farce
is
finished
,
and
another
piece
of
a
graver
cast
brought
upon
the
stage
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
made
a
desperate
attack
upon
Barton
,
who
had
no
other
way
of
saving
himself
,
but
by
leaving
her
in
possession
of
the
field
,
and
avowing
his
pretensions
to
Liddy
,
by
whom
he
has
been
rejected
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
acted
as
his
advocate
and
agent
on
this
occasion
,
with
such
zeal
as
embroiled
her
with
Mrs
Tabitha
,
and
a
high
scene
of
altercation
passed
betwixt
<EOS>
these
two
religionists
,
which
might
have
come
to
action
,
had
not
my
uncle
interposed
.
<EOS>
They
are
,
however
,
reconciled
,
in
consequence
of
an
event
which
hath
involved
us
all
in
trouble
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
the
poor
preacher
,
Humphry
Clinker
,
is
now
exercising
his
ministry
among
the
felons
in
Clerkenwell
prison
.
  
<EOS>
A
postillion
having
sworn
a
robbery
against
him
,
no
bail
could
be
taken
,
and
he
was
committed
to
goal
,
notwithstanding
all
the
remonstrances
and
interest
my
uncle
could
make
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
All
things
considered
,
the
poor
fellow
can
not
possibly
be
guilty
,
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
believe
,
he
runs
some
risque
of
being
hanged
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
his
examination
,
he
answered
with
such
hesitation
and
reserve
,
as
persuaded
most
of
the
people
,
who
crowded
the
place
,
that
he
was
really
a
knave
,
and
the
justice
's
remarks
confirmed
their
opinion
.
<EOS>
Exclusive
of
my
uncle
and
myself
,
there
was
only
one
person
who
seemed
inclined
to
favour
the
culprit
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
,
well
dressed
,
and
from
the
manner
in
which
he
cross
-
examined
the
evidence
,
we
took
it
for
granted
,
that
he
was
a
student
in
one
of
the
inns
of
courts
 
<EOS>
He
freely
checked
the
justice
for
some
uncharitable
inferences
he
made
to
the
prejudice
of
the
prisoners
,
and
even
ventured
to
dispute
with
his
worship
on
certain
points
of
law
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
provoked
at
the
unconnected
and
dubious
answers
of
Clinker
,
who
seemed
in
danger
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
his
own
simplicity
,
exclaimed
,
"
In
the
Name
of
God
,
if
you
are
innocent
,
say
so
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
call
myself
innocent
,
while
my
conscience
is
burdened
with
sin
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
then
,
you
did
commit
this
robbery
?
"
resumed
his
master
,
"
"
<EOS>
No
,
sure
(
said
he
)
blessed
<EOS>
be
the
Lord
<EOS>
,
I
'm
free
of
that
guilt
.
"
    
<EOS>
Here
the
justice
interposed
,
observing
,
that
the
man
seemed
inclined
to
make
a
discovery
by
turning
king
's
evidence
,
and
desired
the
clerk
to
take
his
confession
;
upon
which
Humphry
declared
,
that
he
looked
upon
confession
to
be
a
popish
fraud
,
invented
by
the
whore
of
Babylon
.
<EOS>
The
Templar
,
affirmed
,
that
the
poor
fellow
was
non
compos
;
and
exhorted
the
justice
to
discharge
him
as
a
lunatic
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
very
well
(
added
he
)
that
the
robbery
in
question
was
not
committed
by
the
prisoner
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
thief
-
takers
grinned
at
one
another
;
and
Mr
Justice
Buzzard
replied
with
great
emotion
,
<EOS>
"
Mr
Martin
,
I
desire
you
will
mind
your
own
business
;
I
shall
convince
you
one
of
these
days
that
I
understand
mine
.
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
there
was
no
remedy
;
the
mittimus
was
made
out
,
and
poor
Clinker
sent
to
prison
in
a
hackney
-
coach
,
guarded
by
the
constable
,
and
accompanied
by
your
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
By
the
way
,
I
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
hear
this
retainer
to
justice
bid
the
prisoner
to
keep
up
his
spirits
,
for
that
he
did
not
at
all
doubt
,
but
that
he
would
get
off
for
a
few
weeks
confinement
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
his
worship
knew
very
well
that
Clinker
was
innocent
of
the
fact
,
and
that
the
real
highwayman
,
who
robbed
the
chaise
,
was
no
other
than
that
very
individual
Mr
Martin
,
who
had
pleaded
so
strenuously
for
honest
Humphry
.
    
<EOS>
Confounded
at
this
information
,
I
asked
,
"
Why
then
is
he
suffered
to
go
about
at
his
liberty
,
and
this
poor
innocent
fellow
treated
as
a
malefactor
?
"
<EOS>
"
We
have
exact
intelligence
of
all
Mr
Martin
's
transactions
;
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
but
as
yet
there
is
no
evidence
sufficient
for
his
conviction
;
and
as
for
this
young
man
,
the
justice
could
do
no
less
than
commit
him
,
as
the
postillion
swore
point
-
blank
to
his
identity
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
if
this
rascally
postillion
should
persist
in
the
falsity
to
which
he
is
sworn
,
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
this
innocent
lad
may
be
brought
to
the
gallows
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
constable
observed
,
that
he
would
have
time
enough
to
prepare
for
his
trial
,
and
might
prove
an
alibi
;
or
perhaps
,
Martin
might
be
apprehended
and
convicted
for
another
fact
;
in
which
case
,
he
might
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
this
affair
upon
himself
;
or
finally
,
if
these
chances
should
fail
,
and
the
evidence
stand
good
against
Clinker
,
the
jury
might
recommend
him
to
mercy
,
in
consideration
of
his
youth
,
especially
if
this
should
appear
to
be
the
first
fact
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
.
    
<EOS>
Humphry
owned
he
could
not
pretend
to
recollect
where
he
had
been
on
the
day
when
the
robbery
was
committed
,
much
less
prove
a
circumstance
of
that
kind
so
far
back
as
six
months
,
though
he
knew
he
had
been
sick
of
the
fever
and
ague
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
prevent
him
from
going
about
 
then
,
turning
up
his
eyes
,
he
ejaculated
,
"
The
Lord
's
will
be
done
!
<EOS>
if
it
be
my
fate
to
suffer
,
I
hope
I
shall
not
disgrace
the
faith
,
of
which
,
though
unworthy
,
I
make
profession
.
"
    
<EOS>
When
I
expressed
my
surprize
,
that
the
accuser
should
persist
in
charging
Clinker
,
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
the
real
robber
,
who
stood
before
him
,
and
to
whom
,
indeed
,
Humphry
bore
not
the
smallest
resemblance
;
the
constable
(
who
was
himself
a
thief
-
taker
)
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Martin
was
the
best
qualified
for
business
of
all
the
gentlemen
on
the
road
he
had
ever
known
;
that
he
always
acted
on
his
own
bottom
,
without
partner
or
correspondent
,
and
never
went
to
work
,
but
when
he
was
cool
and
sober
;
that
his
courage
and
presence
of
mind
never
failed
him
;
that
his
address
was
genteel
,
and
his
behaviour
void
of
all
cruelty
and
insolence
;
that
he
never
encumbered
himself
with
watches
or
trinkets
,
nor
even
with
bank
-
notes
,
but
always
dealt
for
ready
money
,
and
that
in
the
current
coin
of
the
kingdom
;
and
that
he
could
disguise
himself
and
his
horse
in
such
a
manner
,
that
,
after
the
action
,
it
was
impossible
to
recognize
either
the
one
or
the
other
 
"
This
great
man
(
said
he
)
has
reigned
paramount
in
all
the
roads
within
fifty
miles
of
London
above
fifteen
months
,
and
has
done
more
business
in
that
time
,
than
all
the
rest
of
the
profession
put
together
;
for
those
who
pass
through
his
hands
,
are
so
delicately
dealt
with
,
that
they
have
no
desire
to
give
him
the
least
disturbance
;
but
for
all
that
,
his
race
is
almost
run
 
he
is
now
fluttering
about
justice
,
like
a
moth
about
a
candle
 
there
are
so
many
lime
-
twigs
laid
in
his
way
,
that
I
'll
bet
a
cool
hundred
,
he
swings
before
Christmas
.
"
    
<EOS>
Shall
I
own
to
you
,
that
this
portrait
,
drawn
by
a
ruffian
,
heightened
by
what
I
myself
had
observed
in
his
deportment
,
has
interested
me
warmly
in
the
fate
of
poor
Martin
,
whom
nature
seems
to
have
intended
for
a
useful
and
honourable
member
of
that
community
upon
which
he
now
preys
for
subsistence
?
<EOS>
It
seems
he
lived
some
time
as
a
clerk
to
a
tember
merchant
,
whose
daughter
Martin
having
privately
married
,
was
discarded
,
and
his
wife
turned
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
long
survive
her
marriage
;
and
Martin
,
turning
fortune
-
hunter
,
could
not
supply
his
occasions
any
other
way
,
than
by
taking
to
the
road
,
in
which
he
has
travelled
hitherto
with
uncommon
success
.
  
<EOS>
He
pays
his
respects
regularly
to
Mr
Justice
Buzzard
,
the
thief
-
catcher
-
general
of
this
metropolis
,
and
sometimes
they
smoke
a
pipe
together
very
lovingly
,
when
the
conversation
generally
turns
upon
the
nature
of
evidence
.
  
<EOS>
The
justice
has
giving
him
fair
warning
to
take
care
of
himself
,
and
he
has
received
his
caution
in
good
part
.
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
has
baffled
all
the
vigilance
,
art
,
and
activity
of
Buzzard
and
his
emissaries
,
with
such
conduct
as
would
have
done
honour
to
the
genius
of
a
Caesar
or
a
Turenne
;
but
he
has
one
weakness
which
has
proved
fatal
to
all
the
heroes
of
his
tribe
,
namely
,
an
indiscreet
devotion
to
the
fair
sex
,
and
in
all
probability
,
he
will
be
attacked
on
this
defenceless
quarter
.
    
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
I
saw
the
body
of
poor
Clinker
consigned
to
the
gaoler
of
Clerkenwell
,
to
whose
indulgence
I
recommended
him
so
effectually
,
that
he
received
him
in
the
most
hospitable
manner
,
though
there
was
a
necessity
for
equipping
him
with
a
suit
of
irons
,
in
which
he
made
a
very
rueful
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
seemed
as
much
affected
by
my
uncle
's
kindness
,
as
by
his
own
misfortune
.
<EOS>
When
I
assured
him
,
that
nothing
should
be
left
undone
for
procuring
his
enlargment
,
and
making
his
confinement
easy
in
the
mean
time
,
he
fell
down
on
his
knees
,
and
kissing
my
hand
,
which
he
bathed
with
his
tears
,
"
O
"
squire
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
,
sobbing
)
<EOS>
what
shall
I
say
?
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
 
no
 
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
speak
 
my
poor
heart
is
bursting
with
gratitude
to
you
and
my
dear
  
dear
 
generous
 
noble
benefactor
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
protest
,
the
scene
became
so
pathetic
,
that
I
was
fain
to
force
myself
away
,
and
returned
to
my
uncle
,
who
sent
me
in
the
afternoon
with
a
compliment
to
one
Mr
Mead
,
the
person
who
had
been
robbed
on
Black
-
heath
.
<EOS>
As
I
did
not
find
him
at
home
,
I
left
a
message
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
called
at
our
lodgings
this
morning
,
and
very
humanely
agreed
to
visit
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
lady
Criskin
had
come
to
make
her
formal
compliments
of
condolance
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
on
this
domestic
calamity
;
and
that
prudent
maiden
,
whose
passion
was
now
cooled
,
thought
proper
to
receive
her
ladyship
so
civilly
,
that
a
reconciliation
immediately
ensued
.
<EOS>
These
two
ladies
resolved
to
comfort
the
poor
prisoner
in
their
own
persons
,
and
Mr
Mead
and
I
"
squired
them
to
Clerkenwell
,
my
uncle
being
detained
at
home
by
some
slight
complaints
in
his
stomach
and
bowels
.
    
<EOS>
The
turnkey
,
who
received
us
at
Clerkenwell
,
looked
remarkably
sullen
;
and
when
we
enquired
for
Clinker
,
"
I
do
n't
care
if
the
devil
had
him
;
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
here
has
been
nothing
but
canting
and
praying
since
the
fellow
entered
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
Rabbit
him
!
<EOS>
the
tap
will
be
ruined
 
we
han't
sold
a
cask
of
beer
,
nor
a
dozen
of
wine
,
since
he
paid
his
garnish
 
<EOS>
the
gentlemen
get
drunk
with
nothing
but
your
damned
religion
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
believe
as
how
your
man
deals
with
the
devil
.
  
<EOS>
Two
or
three
as
bold
hearts
as
ever
took
the
air
upon
Hounslow
,
have
been
blubbering
all
night
;
and
if
the
fellow
an't
speedily
removed
by
Habeas
Corpus
,
or
otherwise
,
I
'll
be
damn'd
<EOS>
if
there
's
a
grain
of
true
spirit
left
within
these
walls
 
we
sha
n't
have
a
soul
to
do
credit
to
the
place
,
or
make
his
exit
like
a
true
-
born
Englishman
 
damn
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
there
will
be
nothing
but
snivelling
in
the
cart
 
<EOS>
we
shall
all
die
like
so
many
psalm
singing
weavers
.
"
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
we
found
that
Humphry
was
,
at
that
very
instant
,
haranguing
the
felons
in
the
chapel
;
and
that
the
gaoler
's
wife
and
daughter
,
together
with
my
aunt
's
woman
,
Win
.
<EOS>
Jenkins
,
and
our
house
-
maid
,
were
among
the
audience
,
which
we
immediately
joined
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
any
thing
so
strongly
picturesque
as
this
congregation
of
felons
clanking
their
chains
,
in
the
midst
of
whom
stood
orator
Clinker
,
expatiating
,
in
a
transport
of
fervour
,
on
the
torments
of
hell
,
denounced
in
scripture
against
evil
-
doers
,
comprehending
murderers
,
robbers
,
thieves
,
and
whoremongers
.
<EOS>
The
variety
of
attention
exhibited
in
the
faces
of
those
ragamuffins
,
formed
a
groupe
that
would
not
have
disgraced
the
pencil
of
a
Raphael
.
<EOS>
In
one
it
denoted
admiration
;
in
another
,
doubt
;
in
a
third
,
disdain
;
in
a
fourth
,
contempt
;
in
a
fifth
terror
;
in
a
sixth
,
derision
;
and
in
a
seventh
,
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
she
was
in
tears
,
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
;
but
whether
for
her
own
sins
,
or
the
misfortune
of
Clinker
,
I
can
not
pretend
to
say
.
<EOS>
The
other
females
seemed
to
listen
with
a
mixture
of
wonder
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
The
gaoler
's
wife
declared
he
was
a
saint
in
trouble
,
saying
,
she
wished
from
her
heart
,
there
was
such
another
good
soul
,
like
him
,
in
every
gaol
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Mead
,
having
earnestly
surveyed
the
preacher
,
declared
his
appearance
was
so
different
from
that
of
the
person
who
robbed
him
on
Black
-
heath
,
that
he
could
freely
make
oath
he
was
not
the
man
:
<EOS>
But
Humphry
himself
was
by
this
time
pretty
well
rid
of
all
apprehensions
of
being
hanged
;
for
he
had
been
the
night
<EOS>
before
solemnly
tried
and
acquitted
by
his
fellow
prisoners
,
some
of
whom
he
had
already
converted
to
methodism
.
<EOS>
He
now
made
proper
acknowledgments
for
the
honour
of
our
visit
,
and
was
permitted
to
kiss
the
hands
of
the
ladies
,
who
assured
him
,
he
might
depend
upon
their
friendship
and
protection
.
<EOS>
Lady
Griskin
,
in
her
great
zeal
,
exhorted
his
fellow
-
prisoners
to
profit
by
the
precious
opportunity
of
having
such
a
saint
in
bonds
among
them
,
and
turn
over
a
new
leaf
for
the
benefit
of
their
poor
souls
;
and
,
that
her
admonition
might
have
the
greater
effect
,
she
reinforced
it
with
her
bounty
.
    
<EOS>
While
she
and
Mrs
Tabby
returned
in
the
coach
with
the
two
maid
-
servants
,
I
waited
on
Mr
Mead
to
the
house
of
justice
Buzzard
,
who
,
having
heard
his
declaration
,
said
his
oath
could
be
of
no
use
at
present
,
but
that
he
would
be
a
material
evidence
for
the
prisoner
at
his
trial
;
so
that
there
seems
to
be
no
remedy
but
patience
for
poor
Clinker
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
same
virtue
,
or
medicine
,
will
be
necessary
for
us
all
,
the
"
squire
in
particular
,
who
had
set
his
heart
upon
his
excursion
to
the
northward
.
    
<EOS>
While
we
were
visiting
honest
Humphry
in
Clerkenwell
prison
,
my
uncle
received
a
much
more
extraordinary
visit
at
his
own
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Mr
Martin
,
of
whom
I
have
made
such
honourable
mention
,
desired
permission
to
pay
him
his
respects
,
and
was
admitted
accordingly
.
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
that
having
observed
him
,
at
Mr
Buzzard
's
,
a
good
deal
disturbed
by
what
had
happened
to
his
servant
,
he
had
come
to
assure
him
he
had
nothing
to
apprehend
for
Clinker
's
life
;
for
if
it
was
possible
that
any
jury
could
find
him
guilty
upon
such
evidence
,
he
,
Martin
himself
,
would
produce
in
court
a
person
,
whose
deposition
would
bring
him
off
clear
as
the
sun
at
noon
.
  
<EOS>
Sure
,
the
fellow
would
not
be
so
romantic
as
to
take
the
robbery
upon
himself
!
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
the
postillion
was
an
infamous
fellow
,
who
had
been
a
dabbler
in
the
same
profession
,
and
saved
his
life
at
the
Old
Bailey
by
impeaching
his
companions
;
that
being
now
reduced
to
great
poverty
,
he
had
made
this
desperate
push
,
to
swear
away
the
life
of
an
innocent
man
,
in
hopes
of
having
the
reward
upon
his
conviction
;
but
that
he
would
find
himself
miserably
disappointed
,
for
the
justice
and
his
myrmidons
were
determined
to
admit
of
no
interloper
in
this
branch
of
business
;
and
that
he
did
not
at
all
doubt
but
that
they
would
find
matter
enough
to
shop
the
evidence
himself
before
the
next
gaol
delivery
.
<EOS>
He
affirmed
,
that
all
these
circumstances
were
well
known
to
the
justice
;
and
that
his
severity
to
Clinker
was
no
other
than
a
hint
to
his
master
to
make
him
a
present
in
private
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
his
candour
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
This
hint
,
however
,
was
so
unpalatable
to
Mr
Bramble
,
that
he
declared
,
with
great
warmth
he
would
rather
confine
himself
for
life
to
London
'
which
he
detested
,
than
be
at
liberty
to
leave
it
to
-
morrow
,
in
consequence
of
encouraging
corruption
in
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
Hearing
,
however
,
how
favourable
Mr
Mead
's
report
had
been
for
the
prisoner
,
he
is
resolved
to
take
the
advice
of
counsel
in
what
manner
to
proceed
for
his
immediate
enlargement
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
in
a
day
or
two
this
troublesome
business
may
be
discussed
;
and
in
this
hope
we
are
preparing
for
our
journey
.
<EOS>
If
our
endeavours
do
not
miscarry
;
we
shall
have
taken
the
field
before
you
hear
again
from
    
Yours
,

<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
THANK
Heaven
!
<EOS>
dear
Lewis
,
the
clouds
are
dispersed
,
and
I
have
now
the
clearest
prospect
of
my
summer
campaign
,
which
,
I
hope
,
I
shall
be
able
to
begin
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
took
the
advice
of
counsel
,
with
respect
to
the
case
of
Clinker
,
in
whose
favour
a
lucky
incident
has
intervened
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
who
accused
him
,
has
had
his
own
battery
turned
upon
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
,
he
was
apprehended
for
a
robbery
on
the
highway
,
and
committed
on
the
evidence
of
an
accomplice
.
<EOS>
Clinker
,
having
moved
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
,
was
brought
before
the
lord
chief
justice
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
an
affidavit
of
the
gentleman
who
had
been
robbed
,
importing
that
the
said
Clinker
was
not
the
person
who
stopped
him
on
the
highway
,
as
well
as
in
consideration
of
the
postillion
's
character
and
present
circumstances
,
was
pleased
to
order
,
that
my
servant
should
be
admitted
to
bail
,
and
he
has
been
discharged
accordingly
,
to
the
unspeakable
satisfaction
of
our
whole
family
,
to
which
he
has
recommended
himself
in
an
extraordinary
manner
,
not
only
by
his
obliging
deportment
,
but
by
his
talents
of
preaching
,
praying
,
and
singing
psalms
,
which
he
has
exercised
with
such
effect
,
that
even
Tabby
respects
him
as
a
chosen
vessel
.
<EOS>
If
there
was
any
thing
like
affectation
or
hypocrisy
in
this
excess
of
religion
,
I
would
not
keep
him
in
my
service
;
but
,
so
far
as
I
can
observe
,
the
fellow
's
character
is
downright
simplicity
,
warmed
with
a
kind
of
enthusiasm
,
which
renders
him
very
susceptible
of
gratitude
and
attachment
to
his
benefactors
.
    
<EOS>
As
he
is
an
excellent
horseman
,
and
understands
farriery
,
I
have
bought
a
stout
gelding
for
his
use
,
that
he
may
attend
us
on
the
road
,
and
have
an
eye
to
our
cattle
,
in
case
the
coachman
should
not
mind
his
business
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
who
is
to
ride
his
own
saddle
horse
,
has
taken
,
upon
trial
,
a
servant
just
come
from
abroad
with
his
former
master
,
sir
William
Strollop
,
who
vouches
for
his
honesty
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
,
whose
name
is
Dutton
,
seems
to
be
a
petit
-
maitre
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
got
a
smattering
of
French
,
bows
,
and
grins
,
and
shrugs
,
and
takes
snuff
a
la
mode
de
France
,
but
values
himself
chiefly
upon
his
skill
and
dexterity
in
hair
-
dressing
 
<EOS>
If
I
am
not
much
deceived
by
appearance
,
he
is
,
in
all
respects
,
the
very
contrast
of
Humphry
Clinker
.
    
<EOS>
My
sister
has
made
up
matters
with
lady
Griskin
;
though
,
I
must
own
,
I
should
not
have
been
sorry
to
see
that
connexion
entirely
destroyed
:
but
Tabby
is
not
of
a
disposition
to
forgive
Barton
,
who
,
I
understand
,
is
gone
to
his
seat
in
Berkshire
for
the
summer
season
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspecting
,
that
in
the
treaty
of
peace
,
which
has
been
lately
ratified
betwixt
<EOS>
those
two
females
,
it
is
stipulated
,
that
her
ladyship
shall
use
her
best
endeavours
to
provide
an
agreeable
help
mate
for
our
sister
Tabitha
,
who
seems
to
be
quite
desperate
in
her
matrimonial
designs
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
the
match
-
maker
is
to
have
a
valuable
consideration
in
the
way
of
brokerage
,
which
she
will
most
certainly
deserve
,
if
she
can
find
any
man
in
his
senses
,
who
will
yoke
with
Mrs
Bramble
from
motives
of
affection
or
interest
.
    
<EOS>
I
find
my
spirits
and
my
health
affect
each
other
reciprocally
 
<EOS>
that
is
to
say
,
every
thing
that
discomposes
my
mind
,
produces
a
correspondent
disorder
in
my
body
;
and
my
bodily
complaints
are
remarkably
mitigated
by
those
considerations
that
dissipate
the
clouds
of
mental
chagrin
 
<EOS>
The
imprisonment
of
Clinker
brought
on
those
symptoms
which
I
mentioned
in
my
last
,
and
now
they
are
vanished
at
his
discharge
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
indeed
,
I
took
some
of
the
tincture
of
ginseng
,
prepared
according
to
your
prescription
,
and
found
it
exceedingly
grateful
to
the
stomach
;
but
the
pain
and
sickness
continued
to
return
,
after
short
intervals
,
till
the
anxiety
of
my
mind
was
entirely
removed
,
and
then
I
found
myself
perfectly
at
ease
.
<EOS>
We
have
had
fair
weather
these
ten
days
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
Londoners
,
who
think
it
portentous
.
<EOS>
If
you
enjoy
the
same
indulgence
in
Wales
,
I
hope
Barns
has
got
my
hay
made
,
and
safe
cocked
,
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
As
we
shall
be
in
motion
for
some
weeks
,
I
can
not
expect
to
hear
from
you
as
usual
;
but
I
shall
continue
to
write
from
every
place
at
which
we
make
any
halt
,
that
you
may
know
our
track
,
in
case
it
should
be
necessary
to
communicate
any
thing
to

DEAR
MARY
,
HAVING
the
occasion
of
my
cousin
Jenkins
of
Aberga'ny
,
I
send
you
,
as
a
token
,
a
turkey
-
shell
comb
,
a
kiple
of
yards
of
green
ribbon
,
and
a
sarment
upon
the
nothingness
of
good
works
,
which
was
preached
in
the
Tabernacle
;
and
you
will
also
receive
a
horn
-
buck
for
Saul
,
whereby
she
may
learn
her
letters
;
for
I
'm
much
consarned
about
the
state
of
her
poor
sole
 
and
what
are
all
the
pursuits
of
this
life
to
the
consarns
of
that
immortal
part
?
  
<EOS>
What
is
life
but
a
veil
of
affliction
?
  
<EOS>
O
Mary
!
<EOS>
the
whole
family
have
been
in
such
a
constipation
!
  
<EOS>
Mr
Clinker
has
been
in
trouble
,
but
the
gates
of
hell
have
not
been
able
to
prevail
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
His
virtue
is
like
poor
gould
,
seven
times
tried
in
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
was
tuck
up
for
a
rubbery
,
and
had
before
gustass
Busshard
,
who
made
his
mittamouse
;
and
the
pore
youth
was
sent
to
prison
upon
the
false
oaf
of
a
willian
,
that
wanted
to
sware
his
life
away
for
the
looker
of
cain
.
    
<EOS>
The
"
squire
did
all
in
his
power
,
but
could
not
prevent
his
being
put
in
chains
,
and
confined
among
common
manufactors
,
where
he
stud
like
an
innocent
sheep
in
the
midst
of
wolves
and
tygers
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
knows
,
what
mought
have
happened
to
this
pyehouse
young
man
,
if
master
had
not
applied
to
Apias
Korkus
,
who
lives
with
the
ould
bailiff
,
and
is
,
they
say
,
five
hundred
years
ould
,
(
God
bless
us
!
)
<EOS>
and
a
congeror
:
<EOS>
but
,
if
he
be
,
sure
I
am
he
do
n't
deal
with
the
devil
,
otherwise
he
would
n't
have
fought
out
Mr
Clinker
,
as
he
did
,
in
spite
of
stone
walls
,
iron
bolts
,
and
double
locks
,
that
flew
open
at
his
command
;
for
Ould
Scratch
has
not
a
greater
enemy
upon
hearth
than
Mr
Clinker
,
who
is
,
indeed
,
a
very
powerfull
labourer
in
the
Lord
's
vineyard
.
<EOS>
I
do
no
more
than
yuse
the
words
of
my
good
lady
,
who
has
got
the
infectual
calling
;
and
,
I
trust
,
that
even
myself
,
though
unworthy
,
shall
find
grease
to
be
excepted
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Liddy
has
been
touch'd
<EOS>
to
the
quick
,
but
is
a
little
timorsome
:
howsomever
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
but
she
,
and
all
of
us
,
will
be
brought
,
by
the
endeavours
of
Mr
Clinker
,
to
produce
blessed
fruit
of
generation
and
repentance
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
master
and
the
young
"
squire
,
they
have
as
yet
had
narro
glimpse
of
the
new
light
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
as
how
their
harts
are
hardened
by
worldly
wisdom
,
which
,
as
the
pyebill
faith
,
is
foolishness
in
the
sight

O
Mary

pray
without
seizing
for
grease
to
prepare
you
for
the
operations
of
this
wonderful
instrument
,
which
,
I
hope
,
will
be
exorcised
this
winter
upon
you
and
others
at
Brambleton

<EOS>
To

morrow
,
we
are
to
set
out
in
a
cox
and
four
for
Yorkshire
;
and
,
I
believe
,
we
shall
travel
that
way
far
,
and
far
,
and
farther
than
I
can
tell
;
but
I
sha
n't
go
so
far
as
to
forget
my
friends
;
and
Mary
Jones
will
always
be
remembered
as
one
of
them
by
her
    
humble
sarvant

MRS

<EOS>
,
I
CAN'T
help
thinking
it
very
strange
,
that
I
never
had
an
answer
to
the
letter
I
wrote
you
some
weeks
ago
from
Bath
,
concerning
the
four
bear
,
the
gander
,
and
the
maids
eating
butter
,
which
I
wo
n't
allow
to
be
wasted
 
<EOS>
We
are
now
going
upon
a
long
gurney
to
the
north
,
whereby
I
desire
you
will
redouble
your
care
and
circumflexion
,
that
the
family
may
be
well
manged
in
our
absence
;
for
,
you
know
,
you
must
render
account
,
not
only
to
your
earthly
master
,
but
also
to
him
that
is
above
:
and
if
you
are
found
a
good
and
faithful
sarvant
,
great
will
be
your
reward
in
heaven
.
<EOS>
I
hope
there
will
be
twenty
stun
of
cheese
ready
for
market
by
the
time
I
get
huom
,
and
as
much
owl
spun

as
will
make
half
a
dozen

and
that
the
savings
of
the
butter

milk
will
fetch
me
a
good
penny
before

,
as
the
two
pigs
are
to
be
fed
for
baking
with
bitchmast
and
acrons

<EOS>
I
wrote
to
doctor
Lews
for
the
same
purpuss
,
but
he
never
had
the
good
manners
to
take
the
least
notice
of
my
letter
;
for
which
reason
,
I
shall
never
favour
him
with
another
,
though
he
beshits
me
on
his
bended
knees
.
<EOS>
You
will
do
well
to
keep
a
watchfull
eye
over
the
hind
Villiams
,
who
is
one

and
,
I
believe
,
no
better

he
should
be
at
bottom

<EOS>
God
forbid
that
I
should
lack
christian
charity
;
but
charity
begins
at
huom

and
sure
nothing
can
be
a
more
charitable
work
than
to
rid
the
family
of
such
vermine
.
<EOS>
I
do
suppose
,
that
the
brindled
cow
has
been
had
to
the

that
old
Moll
has
had
another

<EOS>
Pray
order
every

for
the

and
be
frugal

and
keep

<EOS>
If
I
had
a
private
opportunity

I
would
send

some

to
sing
instead
of
profane

DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
THE
very
day
after
I
wrote
my
last
,
Clinker
was
set
at
liberty
 
<EOS>
As
Martin
had
foretold
,
the
accuser
was
himself
committed
for
a
robbery
,
upon
unquestionable
evidence
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
for
some
time
in
the
snares
of
the
thief
-
taking
society
;
who
,
resenting
his
presumption
in
attempting
to
incroach
upon
their
monopoly
of
impeachment
,
had
him
taken
up
and
committed
to
Newgate
,
on
the
deposition
of
an
accomplice
,
who
has
been
admitted
as
evidence
for
the
king
.
<EOS>
The
postillion
being
upon
record
as
an
old
offender
,
the
chief
justice
made
no
scruple
of
admitting
Clinker
to
bail
,
when
he
perused
the
affidavit
of
Mr
Mead
,
importing
that
the
said
Clinker
was
not
the
person
that
robbed
him
on
Blackheath
;
and
honest
Humphry
was
discharged
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
home
,
he
expressed
great
eagerness
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
master
,
and
here
his
elocution
failed
him
,
but
his
silence
was
pathetic
;
he
fell
down
at
his
feet
,
and
embraced
his
knees
,
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
,
which
my
uncle
did
not
see
without
emotion
 
<EOS>
He
took
snuff
in
some
confusion
;
and
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
gave
him
his
blessing
in
something
more
substantial
than
words
 
<EOS>
"
Clinker
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
am
so
well
convinced
,
both
of
your
honesty
and
courage
,
that
I
am
resolved
to
make
you
my
life
-
guard
-
man
on
the
highway
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
was
accordingly
provided
with
a
case
of
pistols
,
and
a
carbine
to
be
slung
a
-
cross
his
shoulders
;
and
every
other
preparation
being
made
<EOS>
,
we
set
out
last
Thursday
,
at
seven
in
the
morning
;
my
uncle
,
with
the
three
women
in
the
coach
;
Humphry
,
well
mounted
on
a
black
gelding
bought
for
his
use
:
myself
a
-
horseback
,
attended
by
my
new
valet
,
Mr
Dutton
,
an
exceeding
coxcomb
,
fresh
from
his
travels
,
whom
I
have
taken
upon
trial
 
<EOS>
The
fellow
wears
a
solitaire
,
uses
paint
,
and
takes
rappee
with
all
the
grimace
of
a
French
marquis
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
however
,
he
is
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
jack
-
boots
,
leather
breeches
,
a
scarlet
waistcoat
,
with
gold
binding
,
a
laced
hat
,
a
hanger
,
a
French
posting
-
whip
in
his
hand
,
and
his
hair
en
queue
.
    
<EOS>
Before
we
had
gone
nine
miles
,
my
horse
lost
one
of
his
shoes
;
so
that
I
was
obliged
to
stop
at
Barnet
to
have
another
,
while
the
coach
proceeded
at
an
easy
pace
over
the
common
.
<EOS>
About
a
mile
short
of
Hatfield
,
the
postillions
,
stopping
the
carriage
,
gave
notice
to
Clinker
that
there
were
two
suspicious
fellows
a
-
horseback
,
at
the
end
of
a
lane
,
who
seemed
waiting
to
attack
the
coach
.
<EOS>
Humphry
forthwith
apprised
my
uncle
,
declaring
he
would
stand
by
him
to
the
last
drop
of
his
blood
;
and
,
unslinging
his
carbine
,
prepared
for
action
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
had
pistols
in
the
pockets
of
the
coach
,
and
resolved
to
make
use
of
them
directly
;
but
he
was
effectually
prevented
by
his
female
companions
,
who
slung
themselves
about
his
neck
,
and
screamed
in
concert
 
At
that
instant
,
who
should
come
up
at
a
hand
-
gallop
,
but
Martin
,
the
highway
-
man
,
who
,
advancing
to
the
coach
,
begged
the
ladies
would
compose
themselves
for
a
moment
;
then
,
desiring
Clinker
to
follow
him
to
the
charge
,
he
pulled
a
pistol
out
of
his
bosom
,
and
they
rode
up
together
to
give
battle
to
the
rogues
,
who
,
having
fired
at
a
great
distance
,
fled
across
the
common
.
<EOS>
They
were
in
pursuit
of
the
fugitives
when
I
came
up
,
not
a
little
alarmed
at
the
shrieks
in
the
coach
,
where
I
found
my
uncle
in
a
violent
rage
,
without
his
periwig
,
struggling
to
disentangle
himself
from
Tabby
and
the
other
two
,
and
swearing
with
great
vociferation
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
time
to
interpose
,
Martin
and
Clinker
returned
from
the
pursuit
,
and
the
former
payed
his
compliments
with
great
politeness
,
giving
us
to
understand
,
that
the
fellows
had
scampered
off
,
and
that
he
believed
they
were
a
couple
of
raw
"
prentices
from
London
.
<EOS>
He
commended
Clinker
for
his
courage
,
and
said
,
if
he
would
give
him
leave
,
he
would
have
the
honour
to
accompany
us
as
far
as
Stevenage
,
where
he
had
some
business
.
    
<EOS>
The
"
squire
,
having
recollected
and
adjusted
himself
,
was
the
first
to
laugh
at
his
own
situation
;
;
but
it
was
not
without
difficulty
,
that
Tabby
's
arms
could
be
untwisted
from
his
neck
,
Liddy
's
teeth
chattered
,
and
Jenkins
was
threatened
with
a
fit
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
had
communicated
to
my
uncle
the
character
of
Martin
,
as
it
was
described
by
the
constable
,
and
he
was
much
struck
with
its
singularity
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
suppose
the
fellow
had
any
design
on
our
company
,
which
was
so
numerous
and
well
armed
;
he
therefore
thanked
him
for
the
service
he
had
just
done
them
,
said
he
would
be
glad
of
his
company
,
and
asked
him
to
dine
with
us
at
Hatfield
.
<EOS>
This
invitation
might
not
have
been
agreeable
to
the
ladies
,
had
they
known
the
real
profession
of
our
guest
,
but
this
was
a
secret
to
all
,
except
my
uncle
and
myself
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
<EOS>
however
,
would
by
no
means
consent
to
proceed
with
a
case
of
loaded
pistols
in
the
coach
,
and
they
were
forthwith
discharged
in
complaisance
to
her
and
the
rest
of
the
women
.
    
<EOS>
Being
gratified
in
this
particular
,
she
became
remarkably
good
-
humoured
,
and
at
dinner
behaved
in
the
most
affable
manner
to
Mr
Martin
,
with
whose
polite
address
and
agreeable
conversation
she
seemed
to
be
much
taken
.
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
the
landlord
accosting
me
in
the
yard
,
asked
,
with
a
significant
look
,
if
the
gentleman
that
rode
the
sorrel
belonged
to
our
company
?
  
<EOS>
I
understood
his
meaning
,
but
answered
no
;
that
he
had
come
up
with
us
on
the
common
,
and
helped
us
to
drive
away
two
fellows
,
that
looked
like
highwaymen
 
<EOS>
He
nodded
three
times
distinctly
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
he
knows
his
cue
.
<EOS>
Then
he
inquired
,
if
one
of
those
men
was
mounted
on
a
bay
mare
,
and
the
other
on
a
chesnut
gelding
with
a
white
streak
down
his
forehead
?
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
he
assured
me
,
they
had
robbed
three
post
-
chaises
<EOS>
this
very
morning
 
<EOS>
I
inquired
,
in
my
turn
,
if
Mr
Martin
was
of
his
acquaintance
?
<EOS>
and
,
nodding
thrice
again
,
he
answered
,
that
he
had
seen
the
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
Before
we
left
Hatfield
,
my
uncle
,
fixing
his
eyes
on
Martin
with
such
expression
,
as
is
more
easily
conceived
than
described
,
asked
,
if
he
often
travelled
that
road
?
<EOS>
and
he
replied
with
a
look
which
denoted
his
understanding
the
question
,
that
he
very
seldom
did
business
in
that
part
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
this
adventurer
favoured
us
with
his
company
to
the
neighbourhood
of
Stevenage
,
where
he
took
his
leave
of
the
coach
and
me
,
in
very
polite
terms
,
and
turned
off
upon
a
crossroad
,
that
led
to
a
village
on
the
left
.
  
<EOS>
At
supper
,
Mrs
Tabby
was
very
full
in
the
praise
of
Mr
Martin
's
good
-
sense
and
good
-
breeding
,
and
seemed
to
regret
that
she
had
not
a
further
opportunity
to
make
some
experiment
upon
his
affection
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
my
uncle
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
receive
from
the
waiter
,
a
billet
couched
in
these
words
:
     
"
Sir
,
I
could
easily
perceive
from
your
looks
,
when
I
had
the
honour
to
converse
with
you
at
Hatfield
,
that
my
character
is
not
unknown
to
you
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
you
wo
n't
think
it
strange
,
that
I
should
be
glad
to
change
my
present
way
of
life
,
for
any
honest
occupation
,
<EOS>
let
it
be
ever
so
humble
,
that
will
afford
me
bread
in
moderation
,
and
sleep
in
safety
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
think
I
flatter
,
when
I
say
,
that
from
the
moment
I
was
witness
to
your
generous
concern
in
the
cause
of
your
servant
<EOS>
,
I
conceived
a
particular
esteem
and
veneration
for
your
person
;
and
yet
what
I
say
is
true
.
<EOS>
I
should
think
myself
happy
,
if
I
could
be
admitted
into
your
protection
and
service
,
as
a
house
-
steward
,
clerk
,
butler
,
or
bailiff
,
for
either
of
which
places
<EOS>
I
think
myself
tolerably
well
qualified
;
and
,
sure
I
am
,
I
should
not
be
found
deficient
in
gratitude
and
fidelity
:
at
the
same
time
,
I
am
very
sensible
how
much
you
must
deviate
from
the
common
maxims
of
discretion
,
even
in
putting
my
professions
to
the
trial
;
but
I
do
n't
look
upon
you
as
a
person
that
thinks
in
the
ordinary
stile
;
and
the
delicacy
of
my
situation
will
,
I
know
,
justify
this
address
to
a
heart
warmed
with
benificence
and
compassion
.
  
<EOS>
Understanding
you
are
going
pretty
far
north
,
I
shall
take
an
opportunity
to
throw
myself
in
your
way
again
,
before
you
reach
the
borders
of
Scotland
;
and
I
hope
,
by
that
time
,
you
will
have
taken
into
consideration
the
truly
distressful
case
of
,
    
"
honoured
sir
,
your
very
humble
,
and
devoted
servant
,
Edward
Martin
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
"
squire
,
having
perused
this
letter
,
put
it
into
my
hand
without
saying
a
syllable
and
,
when
I
had
read
it
,
we
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
From
a
certain
sparkling
in
his
eyes
,
I
discovered
there
was
more
in
his
heart
,
than
he
cared
to
express
with
his
tongue
,
in
favour
of
poor
Martin
;
and
this
was
precisely
my
own
feeling
,
which
he
did
not
fail
to
discern
,
by
the
same
means
of
communication
 
<EOS>
"
What
shall
we
do
(
said
he
)
to
save
this
poor
sinner
from
the
gallows
,
and
make
him
a
useful
member
of
the
commonwealth
?
<EOS>
And
yet
the
proverb
says
,
Save
a
thief
from
the
gallows
,
and
he
'll
cut
your
throat
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
,
I
really
believed
Martin
was
capable
of
giving
the
proverb
the
lie
;
and
that
I
should
heartily
concur
in
any
step
he
might
take
in
favour
of
his
solicitation
.
<EOS>
We
mutually
resolved
to
deliberate
upon
the
subject
,
and
in
the
mean
time
,
proceeded
on
our
journey
.
<EOS>
The
roads
,
having
been
broke
up
by
the
heavy
rains
in
the
spring
,
were
so
rough
,
that
although
we
travelled
very
slowly
,
the
jolting
occasioned
such
pain
to
my
uncle
,
that
he
was
become
exceedingly
peevish
when
we
arrived
at
this
place
,
which
lies
about
eight
miles
from
the

Harrigate
-
water
,
so
celebrated
for
its
efficacy
in
the
scurvy
and
other
distempers
,
is
supplied
from
a
copious
spring
,
in
the
hollow
of
a
wild
common
,
round
<EOS>
which
,
a
good
many
houses
have
been
built
for
the
convenience
of
drinkers
,
though
few
of
them
are
inhabited
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
company
lodge
at
some
distance
,
in
five
separate
inns
,
situated
in
different
parts
of
the
common
,
<EOS>
from
whence
they
go
every
morning
to
the
well
,
in
their
own
carriages
.
<EOS>
The
lodgers
of
each
inn
form
a
distinct
society
,
that
eat
together
;
and
there
is
a
commodious
,
public
room
,
where
they
breakfast
in
dishabille
,
at
separate
tables
,
from
eight
o'clock
till
eleven
,
as
they
chance
or
choose
to
come
in
 
Here
also
they
drink
tea
in
the
afternoon
,
and
play
at
cards
or
dance
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
One
custom
,
however
,
prevails
,
which
I
look
upon
as
a
solecism
in
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
treat
with
tea
in
their
turns
;
and
even
girls
of
sixteen
are
not
extempted
from
this
shameful
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
public
ball
by
subscription
every
night
at
one
of
the
houses
,
to
which
all
the
company
from
the
others
are
admitted
by
tickets
;
and
indeed
,
Harrigate
,
treads
upon
the
heels
of
Bath
,
in
the
articles
of
gaiety
and
dissipation
  
with
this
difference
,
however
,
that
here
we
are
more
sociable
and
familiar
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
inns
is
already
full
up
to
the
very
garrets
,
having
no
less
than
fifty
lodgers
,
and
as
many
servants
.
<EOS>
Our
family
does
not
exceed
thirty
-
six
;
and
I
should
be
sorry
to
see
the
number
augmented
,
as
our
accommodations
wo
n't
admit
of
much
increase
.
    
<EOS>
At
present
,
the
company
is
more
agreeable
than
one
could
expect
from
an
accidental
assemblage
of
persons
who
are
utter
strangers
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
There
seems
to
be
a
general
disposition
among
us
to
maintain
good
fellowship
,
and
promote
the
purposes
of
humanity
,
in
favour
of
those
who
come
hither
on
the
score
of
health
.
<EOS>
I
see
several
faces
which
we
left
at
Bath
,
although
the
majority
are
of
the
Northern
counties
,
and
may
come
from
Scotland
for
the
benefit
of
these
waters
 
In
such
a
variety
,
there
must
be
some
originals
,
among
whom
Mrs
Tabitha
Bramble
is
not
the
most
inconsiderable
  
No
place
where
there
is
such
an
intercourse
between
the
sexes
,
can
be
disagreeable
to
a
lady
of
her
views
and
temperament
 
<EOS>
She
has
had
some
warm
disputes
at
table
,
with
a
lame
parson
from
Northumberland
,
on
the
new
birth
,
and
the
insignificance
of
moral
virtue
;
and
her
arguments
have
been
reinforced
by
an
old
Scotch
lawyer
,
in
a
tye
-
periwig
,
who
,
though
he
has
lost
his
teeth
,
and
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
can
still
wag
his
tongue
with
great
volubility
.
<EOS>
He
has
paid
her
such
fulsome
compliments
,
upon
her
piety
and
learning
,
as
seem
to
have
won
her
heart
;
and
she
,
in
her
turn
,
treats
him
with
such
attention
as
indicates
a
design
upon
his
person
;
but
,
by
all
acounts
,
he
is
too
much
a
fox
to
be
inveigled
into
any
snare
that
she
can
lay
for
his
affection
.
    
<EOS>
We
do
not
purpose
to
stay
long
at
Harrigate
,
though
,
at
present
,
it
is
our
head
quarters
,
<EOS>
from
whence
we
shall
make
some
excursions
,
to
visit
two
or
three
of
our
rich
relations
,
who
are
settled
in
this
county
.
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
remember
me
to
all
our
friends
of
Jesus
,
and
allow
me
to
be
still

To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
CONSIDERING
the
tax
we
pay
for
turnpikes
,
the
roads
of
this
country
constitute
a
most
intolerable
grievance
.
<EOS>
Between
Newark
and
Weatherby
,
I
have
suffered
more
from
jolting
and
swinging
,
than
ever
I
felt
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
,
although
the
carriage
is
remarkably
commodious
and
well
hung
,
and
the
postillions
were
very
careful
in
driving
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
safely
housed
at
the
New
Inn
at
Harrigate
,
whither
I
came
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
,
rather
than
with
any
view
of
advantage
to
my
health
;
and
truly
,
after
having
considered
all
the
parts
and
particulars
of
the
place
I
can
not
account
for
the
concourse
of
people
one
finds
here
,
upon
any
other
principle
but
that
of
caprice
,
which
seems
to
be
the
character
of
our
nation
.
    
<EOS>
Harrigate
is
a
wild
common
,
bare
and
bleak
without
tree
or
shrub
,
or
the
least
signs
of
cultivation
;
and
the
people
who
come
to
drink
the
water
,
are
crowded
together
in
paltry
inns
,
where
the
few
tolerable
rooms
are
monopolized
by
the
friends
and
favourites
of
the
house
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
lodgers
are
obliged
to
put
up
with
dirty
holes
,
where
there
is
neither
space
,
air
,
nor
convenience
.
<EOS>
My
apartment
is
about
ten
feet
square
;
and
when
the
folding
bed
is
down
,
there
is
just
room
sufficient
to
pass
between
it
and
the
fire
.
<EOS>
One
might
expect
,
indeed
,
that
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
a
fire
at
midsummer
;
but
here
the
climate
is
so
backward
,
that
an
ash
tree
,
which
our
landlord
has
planted
before
my
window
,
is
just
beginning
to
put
forth
its
leaves
;
and
I
am
fain
to
have
my
bed
warmed
every
night
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
water
,
which
is
said
to
have
effected
so
many
surprising
cures
,
I
have
drank
it
once
,
and
the
first
draught
has
cured
me
of
all
desire
to
repeat
the
medicine
.
  
<EOS>
Some
people
say
it
smells
of
rotten
eggs
,
and
other
's
compare
it
to
the
scourings
of
a
foul
gun
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
generally
supposed
to
be
strongly
impregnated
with
sulphur
;
and
Dr
Shaw
,
in
his
book
upon
mineral
waters
,
says
,
he
has
seen
flakes
of
sulphur
floating
in
the
well
 
Pace
tanti
viri
;
I
,
for
my
part
,
have
never
observed
any
thing
like
sulphur
,
either
in
or
or
about
the
well
,
neither
<EOS>
do
I
find
that
any
brimstone
has
ever
been
extracted
from
the
water
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
smell
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
judge
from
my
own
organs
,
it
is
exactly
that
of
bilge
-
water
;
and
the
saline
taste
of
it
seems
to
declare
,
that
it
is
nothing
else
than
salt
water
putrified
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
hold
my
nose
with
one
hand
,
while
I
advanced
the
glass
to
my
mouth
with
the
other
;
and
after
I
had
made
shift
to
swallow
it
,
my
stomach
could
hardly
retain
what
it
had
received
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
effects
it
produced
were
sickness
,
griping
,
and
insurmountable
disgust
 
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
mention
it
without
puking
.
  
<EOS>
The
world
is
strangely
misled
by
the
affectation
of
singularity
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
help
suspecting
,
that
this
water
owes
its
reputation
in
a
great
measure
to
its
being
so
strikingly
offensive
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
same
kind
of
analogy
,
a
German
doctor
has
introduced
hemlock
and
other
poisons
,
as
specifics
,
into
the
materia
medica
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
,
<EOS>
that
all
the
cures
ascribed
to
the
Harrigate
water
,
would
have
been
as
efficaciously
,
and
infinitely
more
agreeably
performed
by
the
internal
and
external
use
of
sea
-
water
.
<EOS>
Sure
I
am
,
this
last
is
much
less
nauseous
to
the
taste
and
smell
,
and
much
more
gentle
in
its
operation
as
a
purge
,
as
well
as
more
extensive
in
its
medical
qualities
.
    
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
,
we
went
across
the
country
to
visit
"
squire
Burdock
,
who
married
a
first
cousin
of
my
father
,
an
heiress
,
who
brought
him
an
estate
of
a
thousand
a
year
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
is
a
declared
opponent
of
the
ministry
in
parliament
;
and
,
having
an
opulent
fortune
,
piques
himself
upon
living
in
the
country
,
and
maintaining
old
English
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
this
is
a
phrase
very
much
used
by
the
English
themselves
,
both
in
words
and
writing
;
but
I
never
heard
of
it
out
of
the
island
,
except
by
way
of
irony
and
sarcasm
.
<EOS>
What
the
hospitality
of
our
forefathers
has
been
,
I
should
be
glad
to
see
recorded
,
rather
in
the
memoirs
of
strangers
who
have
visited
our
country
,
and
were
the
proper
objects
and
judges
of
such
hospitality
,
than
in
the
discourse
and
lucubrations
of
the
modern
English
,
who
seem
to
describe
it
from
theory
and
conjecture
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
we
are
generally
looked
upon
by
foreigners
,
as
a
people
totally
destitute
of
this
virtue
;
and
I
never
was
in
any
country
abroad
,
where
I
did
not
meet
with
persons
of
distinction
who
complained
of
having
been
inhospitably
used
in
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
A
gentleman
of
France
,
Italy
,
or
Germany
,
who
has
entertained
and
lodged
an
Englishman
at
his
house
,
when
he
afterwards
meets
with
his
guest
at
London
,
is
asked
to
dinner
at
the
Saracen
's
head
,
the
Turk's
-
head
the
Boar's
-
head
,
or
the
Bear
,
eats
raw
beef
and
butter
,
drinks
execrable
port
,
and
is
allowed
to
pay
his
share
of
the
reckoning
.
    
<EOS>
But
to
return
from
this
digression
,
which
my
feeling
for
the
honour
of
my
country
obliged
me
to
make
 
our
Yorkshire
cousin
has
been
a
mighty
fox
-
hunter
before
the
Lord
;
but
now
he
is
too
fat
and
unweildy
to
leap
ditches
and
five
bar
-
gates
;
nevertheless
he
still
keeps
a
pack
of
hounds
,
which
are
well
exercised
;
and
his
huntsman
every
night
entertains
him
with
the
adventures
of
the
day
's
chace
,
which
he
recites
in
a
tone
and
terms
that
are
extremely
curious
and
significant
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
his
broad
brawn
is
scratched
by
one
of
his
grooms
.
  
<EOS>
This
fellow
,
it
seems
,
having
no
inclination
to
curry
any
beast
out
of
the
stable
,
was
at
great
pains
to
scollop
his
nails
in
such
a
manner
that
the
blood
followed
at
every
stroke
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
in
hopes
that
he
would
be
dissmissed
from
this
disagreable
office
,
but
the
event
turned
out
contrary
to
his
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
His
master
declared
he
was
the
best
scratcher
in
the
family
;
and
now
he
will
not
suffer
any
other
servant
to
draw
a
nail
upon
his
carcase
.
    
<EOS>
The
"
squire
's
lady
is
very
proud
,
without
being
stiff
or
inaccessible
.
  
<EOS>
She
receives
even
her
inferiors
in
point
of
fortune
with
a
kind
of
arrogant
civility
;
but
then
she
thinks
she
has
a
right
to
treat
them
with
the
most
ungracious
freedoms
of
speech
,
and
never
fails
to
let
them
know
she
is
sensible
of
her
own
superior
affluence
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
she
speaks
well
of
no
living
soul
,
and
has
not
one
single
friend
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
hates
her
mortally
;
but
,
although
the
brute
is
sometimes
so
very
powerful
in
him
that
he
will
have
his
own
way
,
he
generally
truckles
to
her
dominion
,
and
dreads
like
a
school
-
boy
,
the
lash
of
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
she
is
afraid
of
provoking
him
too
far
,
lest
he
should
make
some
desperate
effort
to
shake
of
her
yoke
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
therefore
,
acquiesces
in
the
proofs
he
daily
gives
of
his
attachment
to
the
liberty
of
an
English
freeholder
,
by
saying
and
doing
,
at
his
own
table
,
whatever
gratifies
the
brutality
of
his
disposition
,
or
contributes
to
the
case
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
The
house
,
tho
'
large
,
is
neither
elegant
nor
comfortable
 
<EOS>
It
looks
like
a
great
inn
,
crowded
with
travellers
,
who
dine
at
the
landlord
's
ordinary
,
where
there
is
a
great
profusion
of
victuals
and
drink
,
but
mine
host
seems
to
be
misplaced
;
and
I
would
rather
dine
upon
filberts
with
a
hermit
,
than
feed
upon
venison
with
a
hog
.
<EOS>
The
footmen
might
be
aptly
compared
to
the
waiters
of
a
tavern
,
if
they
were
more
serviceable
and
less
rapacious
;
but
they
are
generally
insolent
and
inattentive
,
and
so
greedy
,
that
,
I
think
,
I
can
dine
better
,
and
for
less
expence
,
at
the
Star
and
Garter
in
Pall
-
mall
,
than
at
our
cousin
's
castle
in
Yorkshire
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
is
also
blessed
with
an
only
son
,
about
two
and
twenty
,
just
returned
from
Italy
,
a
complete
fidler
and
dillettante
;
and
he
slips
no
opportunity
of
manifesting
the
most
perfect
contempt
for
his
own
father
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
,
there
was
a
family
of
foreigners
at
the
house
,
on
a
visit
to
this
virtuoso
,
with
whom
they
had
been
acquainted
at
the
Spa
;
it
was
the
count
de
Melville
,
with
his
lady
,
on
their
way
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Mr
Burdock
had
met
with
an
accident
,
in
consequence
of
which
both
the
count
and
I
would
have
retired
but
the
young
gentleman
and
his
mother
insisted
upon
our
staying
dinner
;
and
their
serenity
seemed
to
be
so
little
ruffled
by
what
had
happened
,
that
we
complied
with
their
invitation
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
had
been
brought
home
over
night
in
his
postchaise
,
so
terribly
belaboured
about
the
pate
,
that
he
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
stupesaction
,
and
had
ever
since
remained
speechless
.
<EOS>
A
country
apothecary
,
called
Grieve
,
who
lived
in
a
neighbouring
village
,
having
been
called
to
his
assistance
,
had
let
him
blood
,
and
applied
a
poultice
to
his
head
,
declaring
,
that
he
had
no
fever
,
nor
any
other
bad
symptom
but
the
loss
of
speech
,
if
he
really
had
lost
that
faculty
.
<EOS>
But
the
young
"
squire
said
this
practitioner
was
an
ignorantaccio
,
that
there
was
a
fracture
in
the
cranium
,
and
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
having
him
trepanned
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
His
mother
espousing
this
opinion
,
had
sent
an
express
to
York
for
a
surgeon
to
perform
the
operation
,
and
he
was
already
come
with
his
"
prentice
and
instruments
.
<EOS>
Having
examined
the
patient
's
head
,
he
began
to
prepare
his
dressings
;
though
Grieve
still
retained
his
first
opinion
that
there
was
no
fracture
,
and
was
the
more
confirmed
in
it
as
the
"
squire
had
passed
the
night
in
profound
sleep
,
uninterrupted
by
any
catching
or
convulsion
.
<EOS>
The
York
surgeon
said
he
could
not
tell
whether
there
was
a
fracture
,
until
he
should
take
of
the
scalp
,
but
,
at
any
rate
,
the
operation
might
be
of
service
,
in
giving
vent
to
any
blood
that
might
be
extravasated
,
either
above
or
below
the
dura
mater
.
<EOS>
The
lady
and
her
son
were
clear
for
trying
the
experiment
;
and
Grieve
was
dismissed
with
some
marks
of
contempt
;
which
,
perhaps
,
he
owed
to
the
plainness
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
about
the
middle
age
,
wore
his
own
black
hair
without
any
sort
of
dressing
;
by
his
garb
,
one
would
have
taken
him
for
a
quaker
,
but
he
had
none
of
the
stiffness
of
that
sect
,
on
the
contrary
,
he
was
very
submissive
,
respectful
,
and
remarkably
taciturn
.
    
<EOS>
Leaving
the
ladies
in
an
apartment
by
themselves
,
we
adjourned
to
the
patient
's
chamber
,
where
the
dressings
and
instruments
were
displayed
in
order
upon
a
pewter
dish
.
<EOS>
The
operator
,
laying
aside
his
coat
and
periwig
,
equipped
himself
with
a
night
-
cap
,
apron
,
and
sleeves
,
while
his
"
prentice
and
footman
,
seizing
the
"
squire
's
head
,
began
to
place
it
in
a
proper
posture
.
  
<EOS>
But
mark
what
followed
.
  
<EOS>
The
patient
,
bolting
upright
in
the
bed
,
collared
each
of
these
assistants
with
the
grasp
of
Hercules
,
exclaiming
,
in
a
bellowing
tone
,
"
I
ha'n't
lived
so
long
in
Yorkshire
to
be
trepanned
by
such
vermin
as
you
;
"
and
leaping
on
the
floor
,
put
on
his
breeches
quietly
,
to
the
astonishment
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
The
surgeon
still
insisted
upon
the
operation
,
alledging
it
was
now
plain
that
the
brain
was
injured
,
and
desiring
the
servants
to
put
him
into
bed
again
;
but
no
body
would
venture
to
execute
his
orders
,
or
even
to
interpose
:
when
the
"
squire
turned
him
and
his
assistants
out
of
doors
,
and
threw
his
apparatus
out
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
asserted
his
prerogative
,
and
put
on
his
cloaths
with
the
help
of
a
valet
,
the
count
,
with
my
nephew
and
me
,
were
introduced
by
his
son
,
and
received
with
his
usual
stile
of
rustic
civility
;
then
turning
to
signor
Macaroni
,
with
a
sarcastic
grin
,
"
I
tell
thee
<EOS>
what
,
Dick
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
a
man
's
scull
is
not
to
be
bored
every
time
his
head
is
broken
;
and
I
'll
convince
thee
and
thy
mother
,
that
I
know
as
many
tricks
as
e'er
<EOS>
an
old
fox
in
the
West
Riding
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
We
afterwards
understood
he
had
quarrelled
at
a
public
house
with
an
exciseman
,
whom
he
challenged
to
a
bout
at
single
stick
,
in
which
he
had
been
worsted
;
and
that
the
shame
of
this
defeat
had
tied
up
his
tongue
.
<EOS>
As
for
madam
,
she
had
shewn
no
concern
for
his
disaster
,
and
now
heard
of
his
recovery
without
emotion
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
taken
some
little
notice
of
my
sister
and
niece
,
though
rather
with
a
view
to
indulge
her
own
petulance
,
than
out
of
any
sentiment
of
regard
to
our
family
.
  
<EOS>
She
said
Liddy
was
a
fright
,
and
ordered
her
woman
to
adjust
her
head
before
dinner
;
but
she
would
not
meddle
with
Tabby
,
whose
spirit
,
she
soon
perceived
,
was
not
to
be
irritated
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
At
table
,
she
acknowledged
me
so
far
as
to
say
she
had
heard
of
my
father
;
though
she
hinted
,
that
he
had
disobliged
her
family
by
making
a
poor
match
in
Wales
.
<EOS>
She
was
disagreeably
familiar
in
her
inquiries
about
our
circumstances
;
and
asked
,
if
I
intended
to
bring
up
my
nephew
to
the
law
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
,
that
,
as
he
had
an
independent
fortune
,
he
should
follow
no
profession
but
that
of
a
country
gentleman
;
and
that
I
was
not
without
hopes
of
procuring
for
him
a
seat
in
parliament
.
 
<EOS>
"
pray
,
cousin
,
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
what
may
his
fortune
be
?
"
<EOS>
When
I
answered
,
that
with
what
I
should
be
able
to
give
him
,
he
would
have
better
than
two
thousand
a
year
,
she
replied
,
with
a
disdainful
toss
of
her
head
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
preserve
his
independence
on
such
a
paltry
provision
.
    
<EOS>
Not
a
little
nettled
at
this
arrogant
remark
,
I
told
her
,
I
had
the
honour
to
sit
in
parliament
with
her
father
,
when
he
had
little
more
than
half
that
income
;
and
I
believed
there
was
not
a
more
independent
and
incorruptible
member
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ay
;
but
times
are
changed
,
(
cried
the
"
squire
)
 
<EOS>
Country
gentlemen
<EOS>
now
-
a
-
days
,
live
after
another
fashion
.
  
<EOS>
My
table
alone
stands
me
in
a
cool
thousand
a
quarter
,
though
I
raise
my
own
stock
,
import
my
own
liquors
,
and
have
every
thing
at
the
first
hand
.
  
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
I
keep
open
house
,
and
receive
all
comers
,
for
the
honour
of
Old
England
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
,
(
said
I
)
'
<EOS>
tis
a
wonder
you
can
maintain
it
at
so
small
an
expence
;
but
every
private
gentleman
is
not
expected
to
keep
a
caravansera
for
the
accommodation
of
travellers
:
indeed
,
if
every
individual
lived
in
the
same
stile
,
you
would
not
have
such
a
number
of
guests
at
your
table
,
of
consequence
<EOS>
your
hospitality
would
not
shine
so
bright
for
the
glory
of
the
West
Riding
.
<EOS>
"
The
young
"
squire
,
tickled
by
this
ironical
observation
,
exclaimed
,
"
O
che
burla
:
"
  
<EOS>
his
mother
eyed
me
in
silence
with
a
supercilious
air
:
and
the
father
of
the
feast
,
taking
a
bumper
of
October
,
"
My
service
to
you
,
cousin
Bramble
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
always
heard
there
was
something
keen
and
biting
in
the
air
of
the
Welsh
mountains
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
was
much
pleased
with
the
count
de
Melville
,
who
is
sensible
,
easy
,
and
polite
;
and
the
countess
is
the
most
amiable
woman
I
ever
beheld
.
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
they
took
leave
of
their
entertainers
,
and
the
young
gentleman
,
mounting
his
horse
,
undertook
to
conduct
their
coach
through
the
park
,
while
one
of
their
servants
rode
round
to
give
notice
to
the
rest
,
whom
they
had
left
at
a
public
house
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
moment
their
backs
were
turned
,
the
censorious
daemon
took
possession
of
our
Yorkshire
landlady
and
our
sister
Tabitha
.
  
<EOS>
The
former
observed
,
that
the
countess
was
a
good
sort
of
a
body
,
but
totally
ignorant
of
good
breeding
,
consequently
aukward
in
her
address
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
said
he
did
not
pretend
to
the
breeding
of
any
thing
but
colts
;
but
that
the
jade
would
be
very
handsome
,
if
she
was
a
litle
more
in
flesh
.
"
<EOS>
Handsome
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Tabby
)
<EOS>
she
has
indeed
a
pair
of
black
eyes
without
any
meaning
;
but
then
there
is
not
a
good
features
in
her
face
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
what
you
call
good
features
in
Wales
;
(
replied
our
landlord
)
but
the'll
pass
in
Yorkshire
.
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Liddy
,
he
added
,
"
What
say
you
,
my
pretty
Redstreak
?
 
<EOS>
what
is
your
opinion
of
the
countess
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
(
cried
Liddy
with
great
emotion
)
<EOS>
she
's
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tabby
chid
her
for
talking
with
such
freedom
in
company
;
and
the
lady
of
the
house
said
,
in
a
contemptuous
tone
,
she
supposed
miss
had
been
brought
up
at
some
country
boarding
-
school
.
    
<EOS>
Our
conversation
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
young
gentleman
,
who
galloped
into
the
yard
all
aghast
,
exclaiming
,
that
the
coach
was
attacked
by
a
great
number
of
highwaymen
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
and
I
rushing
out
,
found
his
own
and
his
servant
's
horse
ready
saddled
in
the
stable
,
with
pistols
in
the
caps
.
  
<EOS>
We
mounted
instantly
,
ordering
Clinker
and
Dutton
to
follow
with
all
possible
expedition
;
but
notwithstanding
all
the
speed
we
could
make
,
the
action
was
over
before
we
arrived
,
and
the
count
with
his
lady
safely
lodged
at
the
house
of
Grieve
,
who
signalized
himself
in
a
very
remarkable
manner
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
At
the
turning
of
a
lane
,
that
led
to
the
village
where
the
count
's
servants
remained
,
a
couple
of
robbers
a
-
horseback
suddenly
appeared
,
with
their
pistols
advanced
:
<EOS>
one
kept
the
coachman
in
awe
,
and
the
other
demanded
the
count
's
money
,
while
the
young
"
squire
went
off
at
full
speed
without
ever
casting
a
look
behind
.
<EOS>
The
count
desiring
the
thief
to
withdraw
his
pistol
,
as
the
lady
was
in
great
terror
,
delivered
his
purse
without
making
the
least
resistance
:
but
not
satisfied
with
this
,
booty
;
which
was
pretty
considerable
,
the
rascal
nsisted
upon
rifling
her
of
her
ear
-
rings
and
necklace
,
and
the
countess
screamed
with
affright
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
exasperated
at
the
violence
with
which
she
was
threatened
,
wrested
the
pistol
out
of
the
fellow
's
hand
,
and
turning
it
upon
him
,
snapped
it
in
his
face
;
but
the
robber
knowing
there
was
no
charge
in
it
,
drew
another
from
his
bosom
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
killed
him
on
the
spot
,
had
not
his
life
been
saved
by
a
wonderful
interposition
.
<EOS>
Grieve
,
the
apothecary
,
chancing
to
pass
that
very
instant
,
ran
up
to
the
coach
,
and
with
a
crab
stick
,
which
was
all
the
weapon
he
had
,
brought
the
fellow
to
the
ground
with
the
first
blow
;
then
seizing
his
pistol
,
presented
it
to
his
colleague
,
who
fired
his
piece
at
random
,
and
fled
without
further
opposition
.
<EOS>
The
other
was
secured
by
the
assistance
of
the
count
and
the
coachman
;
and
his
legs
being
tied
under
the
belly
of
his
own
horse
,
Grieve
conducted
him
to
the
village
,
whither
also
the
carriage
proceeded
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
great
difficulty
the
countess
could
be
kept
from
swooning
;
but
at
last
she
was
happily
conveyed
to
the
house
of
the
apothecary
,
who
went
into
the
shop
to
prepare
some
drops
for
her
,
while
his
wife
and
daughter
administered
to
her
in
another
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
I
found
the
count
standing
in
the
kitchen
with
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
and
expressing
much
impatience
to
see
his
protector
,
whom
as
yet
he
had
scarce
found
time
to
thank
for
the
essential
service
he
had
done
him
and
the
countess
 
<EOS>
The
daughter
passing
at
the
same
time
with
a
glass
of
water
,
monsieur
de
Melville
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
her
figure
which
was
strikingly
engaging
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
(
said
the
parson
)
<EOS>
she
is
the
prettiest
girl
,
and
the
best
girl
in
all
my
parish
;
if
I
could
give
my
son
an
estate
of
ten
thousand
a
year
,
he
should
have
my
consent
to
lay
it
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
If
Mr
Grieve
had
been
as
solicitous
about
getting
money
,
as
he
has
been
in
performing
all
the
duties
of
a
primitive
Christian
,
Fy
would
not
have
hung
so
long
upon
his
hands
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
is
her
name
?
"
said
I.
"
Sixteen
years
ago
(
answered
the
vicar
)
<EOS>
I
christened
her
by
the
names
of
Seraphina
Melvilia
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
how
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
count
eagerly
)
<EOS>
sure
you
said
Seraphina
Melvilia
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
did
;
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
Mr
Grieve
told
me
those
were
the
names
of
two
noble
persons
abroad
,
to
whom
he
had
been
obliged
for
more
than
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
count
,
without
speaking
another
syllable
,
rushed
into
the
parlour
,
crying
,
"
This
is
your
"
god
-
daughter
,
my
dear
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Grieve
,
then
seizing
the
countess
by
the
hand
,
exclaimed
with
great
agitation
,
"
O
madam
!
 
<EOS>
O
sir
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
 
<EOS>
I
am
your
poor
Eleanor
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
my
Seraphina
Melvilia
.
  
<EOS>
O
child
!
<EOS>
these
are
the
count
and
countess
of
Melville
,
the
generous
 
the
glorious
benefactors
of
thy
once
unhappy
parents
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
countess
rising
from
her
seat
,
threw
her
arms
about
the
neck
of
the
amiable
Seraphina
,
and
clapsed
her
to
her
breast
with
great
tenderness
,
while
she
herself
was
embraced
by
the
weeping
mother
.
<EOS>
This
moving
scene
was
completed
by
the
entrance
of
Grieve
himself
,
who
falling
on
his
knees
before
the
count
,
Behold
(
said
he
)
a
penitent
,
who
at
length
can
look
upon
his
patron
without
shrinking
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Ferdinand
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
,
raising
and
folding
him
in
his
arms
)
<EOS>
the
play
fellow
of
my
infancy
 
<EOS>
the
companion
of
my
youth
!
  
<EOS>
Is
it
to
you
<EOS>
then
I
am
indebted
for
my
life
?
"
<EOS>
"
Heaven
has
heard
my
prayer
,
(
said
the
other
)
and
given
me
an
opportunity
to
prove
myself
not
altogether
unworthy
of
your
clemency
and
protection
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
kissed
the
hand
of
the
countess
,
while
monsieur
de
Melville
saluted
his
wife
and
lovely
daughter
,
and
all
of
us
were
greatly
affected
by
this
pathetic
recognition
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
Grieve
was
no
other
than
Ferdinand
count
Fathom
,
whose
adventures
were
printed
many
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Being
a
sincere
convert
to
virtue
,
he
had
changed
his
name
,
that
he
might
elude
the
inquiries
of
the
count
,
whose
generous
allowance
he
determined
to
forego
,
that
he
might
have
no
dependence
but
upon
his
own
industry
and
moderation
.
<EOS>
He
had
accordingly
settled
in
this
village
as
a
practitioner
in
surgery
and
physic
,
and
for
some
years
wrestled
with
all
the
miseries
of
indigence
,
which
,
however
,
he
and
his
wife
had
borne
with
the
most
exemplary
resignation
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
by
dint
of
unwearied
attention
to
the
duties
of
his
profession
,
which
he
exercised
with
equal
humanity
and
success
,
he
had
acquired
a
tolerable
share
of
business
among
the
farmers
and
common
people
,
which
enabled
him
to
live
in
a
decent
manner
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
scarce
even
seen
to
smile
;
was
unaffectedly
pious
;
and
all
the
time
he
could
spare
from
the
avocations
of
his
employment
he
spent
in
educating
his
daughter
,
and
in
studying
for
his
own
improvement
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
adventurer
Fathom
was
,
under
the
name
of
Grieve
,
universally
respected
among
the
commonalty
of
this
district
,
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
These
particulars
I
learned
from
the
vicar
,
when
we
quitted
the
room
,
that
they
might
be
under
no
restraint
in
their
mutual
effusions
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
that
Grieve
will
be
pressed
to
leave
off
business
,
and
re
-
unite
himself
to
the
count
's
family
;
and
as
the
countess
seemed
extremely
fond
of
his
daughter
,
she
will
in
all
probability
insist
upon
Seraphina
's
accompanying
her
to
Scotland
.
    
<EOS>
Having
paid
our
compliments
to
these
noble
persons
,
we
returned
to
the
"
squires
,
where
we
expected
an
invitation
to
pass
the
night
,
which
was
wet
and
raw
;
but
it
seems
"
squire
Burdock
's
hospitality
reached
not
so
far
for
the
honour
of
Yorkshire
:
we
departed
in
the
evening
,
and
lay
at
an
inn
,
where
I
caught
cold
.
    
<EOS>
In
hope
of
riding
it
down
before
it
could
take
fast
hold
on
my
constitution
,
I
resolved
to
visit
another
relation
,
one
Mr
Pimpernel
,
who
lived
about
a
dozen
miles
from
the
place
where
we
lodged
.
<EOS>
Pimpernel
,
being
the
youngest
of
four
sons
,
was
bred
an
attorney
at
Furnival's
-
inn
;
but
all
his
elder
brothers
dying
<EOS>
,
he
got
himself
called
to
the
bar
for
the
honour
of
his
family
,
and
soon
after
this
preferment
,
succeeded
to
his
father
's
estate
,
which
was
very
considerable
.
<EOS>
He
carried
home
with
him
all
the
knavish
chicanery
of
the
lowest
pettifogger
,
together
with
a
wife
whom
he
had
purchased
of
a
drayman
for
twenty
pounds
;
and
he
soon
found
means
to
obtain
a
Dedimus
as
an
acting
justice
of
peace
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
only
a
sordid
miser
in
his
disposition
,
but
his
avarice
is
mingled
with
a
spirit
of
despotism
,
which
is
truly
diabolical
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
a
brutal
husband
,
an
unnatural
parent
,
a
harsh
master
,
an
oppressive
landlord
,
a
litigious
neighbour
,
and
a
partial
magistrate
.
  
<EOS>
Friends
he
has
none
;
and
in
point
of
hospitality
and
good
breeding
,
our
cousin
Burdock
is
a
prince
in
comparison
of
this
ungracious
miscreant
,
whose
house
is
the
lively
representation
of
a
goal
.
<EOS>
Our
reception
was
suitable
to
the
character
I
have
sketched
.
<EOS>
Had
it
depended
upon
the
wife
,
we
should
have
been
kindly
treated
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
really
a
good
sort
of
a
woman
,
in
spite
of
her
low
original
,
and
well
respected
in
the
country
;
but
she
has
not
interest
enough
in
her
own
house
to
command
a
draught
of
table
-
beer
,
far
less
to
bestow
any
kind
of
education
on
her
children
,
who
run
about
,
like
ragged
colts
,
in
a
state
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Pox
on
him
!
<EOS>
he
is
such
a
dirty
fellow
,
that
I
have
not
patience
to
prosecute
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
By
the
time
we
reached
Harrigate
,
I
began
to
be
visited
by
certain
rheumatic
symptoms
.
<EOS>
The
Scoth
lawyer
,
Mr
Micklewhimmen
,
recommended
a
hot
bath
of
these
waters
so
earnestly
that
I
was
over
-
persuaded
to
try
the
experiment
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
used
it
often
with
success
,
and
always
stayed
an
hour
in
the
bath
,
which
was
a
tub
filled
with
Harrigate
water
,
heated
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
hardly
bear
the
smell
of
a
single
tumbler
when
cold
,
you
may
guess
how
my
nose
was
regaled
by
the
steams
arising
from
a
hot
bath
of
the
same
fluid
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
I
was
conducted
into
a
dark
hole
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
the
tub
smoaked
and
stunk
like
the
pot
of
Acheron
,
in
one
corner
,
and
in
another
stood
a
dirty
bed
provided
with
thick
blankets
,
in
which
I
was
to
sweat
after
coming
out
of
the
bath
.
<EOS>
My
heart
seemed
to
die
within
me
when
I
entered
this
dismal
bagnio
,
and
sound
my
brain
assaulted
by
such
insufferable
effluvia
.
  
<EOS>
I
cursed
Micklewhimmen
for
not
considering
that
my
organs
were
formed
on
this
side
of
the
Tweed
;
but
being
ashamed
to
recoil
upon
the
treshold
,
I
submitted
to
the
process
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
endured
all
but
real
suffocation
for
above
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
tub
,
I
was
moved
to
the
bed
and
wrapped
in
blankets
 
<EOS>
There
I
lay
a
full
hour
panting
with
intollerable
heat
;
but
not
the
least
moisture
appearing
on
my
skin
,
I
was
carried
to
my
chamber
,
and
passed
the
night
without
closing
an
eye
,
in
such
a
flutter
of
spirits
as
rendered
me
the
most
miserable
wretch
in
being
.
<EOS>
I
should
certainly
have
run
distracted
,
if
the
rarefaction
of
my
blood
,
occasioned
by
that
Stygian
bath
,
had
not
burst
the
vessels
,
and
produced
a
violent
haemorage
,
which
,
though
dreadful
and
alarming
,
removed
the
horrible
disquiet
.
  
<EOS>
I
lost
two
pounds
of
blood
,
and
more
,
on
this
occasion
;
and
find
myself
still
weak
and
languid
;
but
,
I
believe
,
a
little
exercise
will
forward
my
recovery
;
and
therefore
I
am
resolved
to
set
out
to
-
morrow
for
York
,
in
my
way
to
Scarborough
,
where
I
propose
to
brace
up
my
fibres
by
a
sea
-
bathing
,
which
,
I
know
,
is
one
of
your
favourite
specifics
.
<EOS>
There
is
however
,
one
disease
,
for
which
you
have
found
as
yet
no
specific
,
and
that
is
old
age
,
of
which
this
tedious
unconnected
epistle
is
an
infallible
symptom
:
 
what
,
therefore
,
can
not
be
cured
,
must
be
endured
,
by
you
,
as
well
as
by
    
Yours

DEAR
KNIGHT
,
THE
manner
of
living
at
Harrigate
was
so
agreeable
to
my
disposition
,
that
I
left
the
place
with
some
regret
 
Our
aunt
Tabby
would
have
probably
made
some
objection
to
our
departing
so
soon
,
had
not
an
accident
embroiled
her
with
Mr
Micklewhimmen
,
the
Scotch
advocate
,
on
whose
heart
she
had
been
practising
,
from
the
second
day
after
our
arrival
 
<EOS>
That
original
,
though
seemingly
precluded
from
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
had
turned
his
genius
to
good
account
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
by
dint
of
groaning
,
and
whining
,
he
had
excited
the
compassion
of
the
company
so
effectually
,
that
an
old
lady
,
who
occupied
the
very
best
apartment
in
the
house
,
gave
it
up
for
his
ease
and
convenience
.
<EOS>
When
his
man
led
him
into
the
Long
Room
,
all
the
females
were
immediately
in
commotion
.
  
<EOS>
One
set
an
elbow
-
chair
;
another
shook
up
the
cushion
;
a
third
brought
a
stool
;
and
a
fourth
a
pillow
,
for
the
accommondation
of
his
feet
 
<EOS>
Two
ladies
(
of
whom
Tabby
was
always
one
)
supported
him
into
the
dining
-
room
,
and
placed
him
properly
at
the
table
;
and
his
taste
was
indulged
with
a
succession
of
delicacies
,
culled
by
their
fair
hands
.
<EOS>
All
this
attention
he
repaid
with
a
profusion
of
compliments
and
benedictions
,
which
were
not
the
less
agreeable
for
being
delivered
in
the
Scottish
dialect
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mrs
Tabitha
,
his
respects
were
particulary
addressed
to
her
,
and
did
not
fail
to
mingle
them
with
religious
reflections
,
touching
free
grace
,
knowing
her
bias
to
methodism
,
which
he
also
professed
upon
a
calvinistical
model
.
    
<EOS>
For
my
part
I
could
not
help
thinking
this
lawyer
was
not
such
an
invalid
as
he
pretended
to
be
.
<EOS>
I
observed
he
eat
very
heartily
three
times
a
-
day
;
and
tho
'
his
bottle
was
marked
stomachic
tincture
,
he
had
recourse
to
it
so
often
,
and
seemed
to
swallow
it
with
such
peculiar
relish
,
that
I
suspected
it
was
not
compounded
in
the
apothecary
's
shop
,
or
the
chemist
's
laboratory
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
while
he
was
earnest
in
discourse
with
Mrs
Tabitha
,
and
his
servant
had
gone
out
on
some
occasion
or
other
,
I
dexterously
exchanged
the
labels
,
and
situation
of
his
bottle
and
mine
;
and
having
tasted
his
tincture
,
found
it
was
excellent
claret
.
<EOS>
I
forthwith
handed
it
about
to
some
of
my
neighbours
,
and
it
was
quite
emptied
before
Mr
Micklewhimmen
had
occasion
to
repeat
his
draught
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
turning
about
,
he
took
hold
of
my
bottle
,
instead
of
his
own
,
and
,
filling
a
large
glass
,
drank
to
the
health
of
Mrs
Tabitha
 
<EOS>
It
had
scarce
touched
his
lips
when
he
perceived
the
change
which
had
been
put
upon
him
,
and
was
at
first
a
little
out
of
countenance
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
retire
within
himself
,
in
order
to
deliberate
,
and
in
half
a
minute
his
resolution
was
taken
;
addressing
himself
to
our
quater
,
<EOS>
"
I
give
the
gentleman
credit
for
his
wit
(
said
he
)
;
it
was
a
gude
practical
joke
;
but
sometimes
hi
joci
in
seria
ducunt
mala
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
,
for
his
own
sake
,
he
has
na
drank
all
the
liccor
;
for
it
was
a
vara
poorful
infusion
of
jallop
in
Bourdeaux
wine
:
as
it
's
possible
he
may
ha
ta'en
sic
a
dose
as
will
produce
a
terrible
catastrophe
in
his
ain
booels
.
"
     
<EOS>
By
far
the
greater
part
of
the
contents
had
fallen
to
the
share
of
a
young
clothier
from
Leeds
,
who
had
come
to
make
a
figure
at
Harrigate
,
and
was
,
in
effect
,
a
great
coxcomb
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
view
to
laugh
at
his
fellow
guests
,
as
well
as
to
mortify
the
lawyer
,
that
he
had
emptied
the
bottle
,
when
it
came
to
his
turn
,
and
he
had
laughed
accordingly
:
but
now
his
mirth
gave
way
to
his
apprehension
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
spit
,
to
make
wry
faces
and
writhe
himself
into
various
contorsions
 
<EOS>
"
Damn
the
stuff
,
(
cried
he
,
)
I
thought
it
had
a
villainous
twang
 
<EOS>
pah
!
<EOS>
He
that
would
cozen
a
Scot
mun
get
oop
betimes
and
take
old
Scratch
for
his
counsellor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
troth
,
mester
whet
d'ye
ca'um
,
(
replied
the
lawyer
)
<EOS>
your
wit
has
run
you
into
a
filthy
puddle
 
<EOS>
I
'm
truly
consarned
for
your
waeful
case
 
<EOS>
The
best
advice
I
can
give
you
,
in
sic
a
delemma
,
is
to
send
an
express
to
Rippon
for
doctor
Waugh
,
without
delay
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
swallow
all
the
oil
and
butter
you
can
find
in
the
hoose
,
to
defend
your
poor
stomach
and
intastins
from
the
villication
of
the
particles
of
the
jallap
,
which
is
vara
violent
,
even
when
taken
in
moderation
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
poor
clothier
's
torments
had
already
begun
:
he
retired
,
roaring
with
pain
,
to
his
own
chamber
;
the
oil
was
swallowed
,
and
the
doctor
sent
for
;
but
before
he
arrived
,
the
miserable
patient
had
made
such
discharges
upwards
and
downwards
,
that
nothing
remained
to
give
him
further
offence
;
and
this
double
evacuation
was
produced
by
imagination
alone
;
for
what
he
had
drank
was
genuine
wine
of
Bourdeaux
,
which
the
lawyer
had
brought
from
Scotland
for
his
own
private
use
.
<EOS>
The
clothier
,
finding
the
joke
turn
out
so
expensive
and
disagreeable
,
quitted
the
house
next
morning
,
leaving
the
triumph
to
Micklewhimmen
,
who
enjoyed
it
internally
,
without
any
outward
signs
of
exultation
;
 
on
the
contrary
,
he
affected
to
pity
the
young
man
for
what
he
had
suffered
,
and
acquired
fresh
credit
from
this
shew
of
moderation
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
about
the
middle
of
the
night
,
which
succeeded
this
adventure
,
that
the
vent
of
the
kitchen
chimney
being
foul
,
the
foot
took
fire
,
and
the
alarm
was
given
in
a
dreadful
manner
 
<EOS>
Every
body
leaped
naked
out
of
bed
,
and
in
a
minute
the
whole
house
was
filled
with
cries
and
confusion
 
There
were
two
stairs
in
the
house
,
and
to
these
we
naturally
ran
;
but
they
were
both
so
blocked
up
,
by
the
people
pressing
upon
one
another
,
that
it
seemed
impossible
to
pass
,
without
throwing
down
and
trampling
upon
the
women
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
anarchy
,
Mr
Micklewhimmen
,
with
a
leathern
portmanteau
on
his
back
,
came
running
as
nimble
as
a
buck
along
the
passage
;
and
Tabby
,
in
her
under
petticoat
,
endeavouring
to
hook
him
under
the
arm
,
that
she
might
escape
thro
'
his
protection
,
he
very
fairly
pushed
her
down
,
crying
,
"
Na
,
na
,
gude
faith
,
charity
begins
at
hame
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Without
paying
the
least
respect
to
the
shrieks
and
intreaties
of
his
female
friends
,
he
charged
through
the
midst
of
the
crowd
,
overturning
every
thing
that
opposed
him
,
and
actually
fought
his
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
stair
-
case
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
Clinker
had
found
a
ladder
,
by
which
he
entered
the
window
of
my
uncle
's
chamber
,
where
our
family
was
assembled
,
and
proposed
that
we
should
make
our
exit
successively
by
that
conveyance
.
<EOS>
The
"
squire
exhorted
his
sister
to
begin
the
descent
;
but
,
before
she
could
resolve
,
her
woman
,
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
in
a
transport
of
terror
,
threw
herself
out
at
the
window
upon
the
ladder
,
while
Humphry
dropped
upon
the
ground
,
that
he
might
receive
her
in
her
descent
 
<EOS>
This
maiden
was
just
as
she
had
started
out
of
bed
,
the
moon
shone
very
bright
,
and
a
fresh
breeze
of
wind
blowing
,
none
of
Mrs
Winifred
's
beauties
could
possibly
escape
the
view
of
the
fortunate
Clinker
,
whose
heart
was
not
able
to
withstand
the
united
force
of
so
many
charms
;
at
least
,
I
am
much
mistaken
,
if
he
has
not
been
her
humble
slave
from
that
moment
 
<EOS>
He
received
her
in
his
arms
,
and
,
giving
her
his
coat
to
protect
her
from
the
weather
,
ascended
again
with
admirable
dexterity
.
    
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
the
landlord
of
the
house
called
out
with
an
audible
voice
,
that
the
fire
was
extinguished
,
and
the
ladies
had
nothing
to
fear
:
this
was
a
welcome
note
to
the
audience
,
and
produced
an
immediate
effect
;
the
shrieking
ceased
,
and
a
confused
sound
of
expostulation
ensued
.
<EOS>
I
conducted
Mrs
Tabitha
and
my
sister
to
their
own
chamber
,
where
Liddy
fainted
away
;
but
was
soon
brought
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Then
I
went
to
offer
my
services
to
the
other
ladies
,
who
might
want
assistance
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
scudding
through
the
passage
to
their
several
apartments
;
and
as
the
thoroughfair
was
lighted
by
two
lamps
,
I
had
a
pretty
good
observation
of
them
in
their
transit
;
but
,
as
most
of
them
were
naked
to
the
smock
,
and
all
their
heads
shrowded
in
huge
night
-
caps
,
I
could
not
distinguish
one
face
from
another
,
though
I
recognized
some
of
their
voices
 
<EOS>
These
were
generally
plaintive
;
some
wept
,
some
scolded
,
and
some
prayed
 
<EOS>
I
lifted
up
one
poor
old
gentlewoman
,
who
had
been
overturned
and
sore
bruised
by
a
multitude
of
feet
;
and
this
was
also
the
case
with
the
lame
parson
from
Northumberland
,
whom
Micklewhimmen
had
in
his
passage
overthrown
,
though
not
with
impunity
;
for
the
cripple
,
in
falling
,
gave
him
such
a
good
pelt
on
the
head
with
his
crutch
,
that
the
blood
followed
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
this
lawyer
,
he
waited
below
till
the
hurly
-
burly
was
over
,
and
then
stole
softly
to
his
own
chamber
,
from
whence
he
did
not
venture
to
make
a
second
sally
till
eleven
in
the
forenoon
,
when
he
was
led
into
the
public
room
by
his
own
servant
and
another
assistant
,
groaning
most
woefully
,
with
a
bloody
napkin
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
things
were
greatly
altered
 
The
selfish
brutality
of
his
behaviour
on
the
stairs
had
steeled
their
hearts
against
all
his
arts
and
address
 
Not
a
soul
offered
to
accommodate
him
with
a
chair
,
cushion
,
or
footstool
;
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
on
a
hard
wooden
bench
 
<EOS>
In
that
position
,
he
looked
around
with
a
rueful
aspect
,
and
,
bowing
very
low
,
said
,
in
a
whining
tone
,
"
Your
most
humble
servant
,
ladies
 
<EOS>
Fire
is
a
dreadful
calamity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fire
purifies
gold
,
and
it
tries
friendship
,
"
cried
Mrs
Tabitha
,
bridling
.
<EOS>
"
Yea
,
madam
(
replied
Micklewhimmen
)
and
it
trieth
discretion
also
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
discretion
consists
in
forsaking
,
a
friend
in
adversity
,
you
are
eminently
possessed
of
that
virtue
,
"
resumed
our
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
Na
,
madam
(
rejoined
the
advocate
)
<EOS>
well
I
wot
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
claim
any
merit
from
the
mode
of
my
retreat
 
<EOS>
Ye'll
please
to
observe
,
ladies
,
there
are
twa
independent
principles
that
actuate
our
nature
 
<EOS>
One
is
instinct
,
which
we
have
in
common
with
the
brute
creation
,
and
the
other
is
reason
 
<EOS>
Noo
,
in
certain
great
emergencies
,
when
the
faculty
of
reason
is
suspended
,
instinct
takes
the
lead
,
and
,
when
this
predominates
,
having
no
affinity
with
reason
,
it
pays
no
sort
of
regard
to
its
connections
;
it
only
operates
for
the
benefit
of
the
individual
,
and
that
by
the
most
expeditious
and
effectual
means
;
therefore
,
begging
your
pardon
,
ladies
,
I
'm
no
accountable
in
foro
conscientiae
,
for
what
I
did
,
while
under
the
influence
of
this
irresistable
pooer
.
"
    
<EOS>
Here
my
uncle
interposing
,
"
I
should
be
glad
to
know
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
whether
it
was
instinct
that
prompted
you
to
retreat
with
bag
and
baggage
;
for
,
I
think
,
you
had
a
portmanteau
on
your
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
lawyer
answered
,
without
hesitation
,
"
Gif
I
might
tell
my
mind
freely
,
without
incurring
the
suspicion
of
presumption
,
I
should
think
it
was
something
superior
to
either
reason
or
instinct
which
suggested
that
measure
,
and
this
on
a
twafald
account
:
in
the
first
place
,
the
portmanteau
contained
the
writings
of
a
worthy
nobleman
's
estate
;
and
their
being
burned
,
would
have
occasioned
a
loss
that
could
not
be
repaired
:
<EOS>
secondly
,
my
good
angel
seems
to
have
laid
the
portmantle
on
my
shoulders
,
by
way
of
defence
,
to
sustain
the
violence
of
a
most
inhuman
blow
,
from
the
crutch
of
a
reverend
clergyman
,
which
,
even
in
spite
of
that
medium
,
hath
wounded
me
sorely
,
even
unto
the
pericranium
.
"
<EOS>
By
your
own
doctrine
(
cried
the
parson
,
who
chanced
to
be
present
)
<EOS>
I
am
not
accountable
for
the
blow
,
which
was
the
effect
of
instinct
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
crave
your
pardon
,
reverend
sir
(
said
the
other
)
instinct
never
acts
but
for
the
preservation
of
the
individual
;
but
your
preservation
was
out
of
the
case
 
<EOS>
You
had
already
received
the
damage
,
and
therefore
the
blow
must
be
imputed
to
revenge
,
which
is
a
sinful
passion
,
that
ill
becomes
any
Christian
,
especially
a
Protestant
divine
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
most
reverend
doctor
,
gin
<EOS>
I
had
a
mind
to
plea
<EOS>
,
the
law
would
hauld
my
libel
relevant
.
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
damage
is
pretty
equal
on
both
sides
(
cried
the
parson
)
;
your
head
is
broke
,
and
my
crutch
is
snapped
in
the
middle
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
you
will
repair
the
one
,
I
will
be
at
the
expence
of
curing
the
other
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
sally
raised
the
laugh
against
Micklewhimmen
,
who
began
to
look
grave
;
when
my
uncle
,
in
order
to
change
the
discourse
,
observed
,
that
instinct
had
been
very
kind
to
him
in
another
respect
;
for
it
had
restored
to
him
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
which
,
in
his
exit
,
he
had
moved
with
surprising
agility
.
  
<EOS>
He
replied
,
that
it
was
the
nature
of
fear
to
brace
up
the
nerves
;
and
mentioned
some
surprising
feats
of
strength
and
activity
performed
by
persons
under
the
impulse
of
terror
;
but
he
complained
,
that
,
in
his
own
particular
,
the
effects
had
ceased
,
when
the
cause
was
taken
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
squire
said
,
he
would
lay
a
tea
-
drinking
on
his
head
,
that
he
should
dance
a
Scotch
measure
,
without
making
a
false
step
;
and
the
advocate
grinning
,
called
for
the
piper
.
  
<EOS>
A
fiddler
being
at
hand
,
this
original
started
up
,
with
his
bloody
napkin
over
his
black
tye
-
periwig
,
and
acquitted
himself
in
such
a
manner
,
as
excited
the
mirth
of
the
whole
company
;
but
he
could
not
regain
the
good
graces
of
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
did
not
understand
the
principle
of
instinct
;
and
the
lawyer
did
not
think
it
worth
his
while
to
proceed
to
further
demonstration
.
    
<EOS>
From
Harrigate
we
came
hither
,
by
the
way
of
York
,
and
here
we
shall
tarry
for
some
days
,
as
my
uncle
and
Tabitha
are
both
resolved
to
make
use
of
the
waters
.
<EOS>
Scarborough
,
though
a
paltry
town
,
is
romantic
,
from
its
situation
along
a
cliff
that
overhangs
the
sea
.
<EOS>
The
harbour
is
formed
by
a
small
elbow
of
land
that
runs
out
as
a
natural
mole
,
directly
opposite
to
the
town
;
and
on
that
side
is
the
castle
,
which
stands
very
high
,
of
considerable
extent
,
and
,
before
the
invention
of
gun
-
powder
,
was
counted
impregnable
.
<EOS>
At
the
other
end
of
Scarborough
are
two
public
rooms
for
the
use
of
the
company
,
who
resort
to
this
place
in
the
summer
,
to
drink
the
waters
or
bathe
in
the
sea
;
and
the
diversions
are
pretty
much
on
the
same
footing
here
as
at
Bath
.
<EOS>
The
Spa
is
a
little
way
beyond
the
town
,
on
this
side
,
under
a
cliff
,
within
a
few
paces
of
the
sea
,
and
thither
the
drinkers
go
every
morning
in
dishabille
;
but
the
descent
is
by
a
great
number
of
steps
,
which
invalids
find
very
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
Betwixt
the
well
and
the
harbour
<EOS>
,
the
bathing
machines
are
ranged
along
the
beach
,
with
all
their
proper
utensils
and
attendants
 
You
have
never
seen
one
of
these
machines
 
Image
to
yourself
a
small
,
snug
,
wooden
chamber
,
fixed
upon
a
wheel
-
carriage
,
having
a
door
at
each
end
and
on
each
side
a
little
window
above
,
a
bench
below
 
The
bather
,
ascending
into
this
apartment
by
wooden
steps
,
shuts
himself
in
,
and
begins
to
undress
,
while
the
attendant
yokes
a
horse
to
the
end
next
the
sea
,
and
draws
the
carriage
forwards
,
till
the
surface
of
the
water
is
on
a
level
with
the
floor
of
the
dressing
-
room
,
then
he
moves
and
fixes
the
horse
to
the
other
end
 
<EOS>
The
person
within
being
stripped
,
opens
the
door
to
the
sea
-
ward
,
where
he
finds
the
guide
ready
,
and
plunges
headlong
into
the
water
 
After
having
bathed
,
he
re
-
ascends
into
the
apartment
,
by
the
steps
which
had
been
shifted
for
that
purpose
,
and
puts
on
his
clothes
at
his
leisure
,
while
the
carriage
is
drawn
back
again
upon
the
dry
land
;
so
that
he
has
nothing
further
to
do
,
but
to
open
the
door
,
and
come
down
as
he
went
up
 
Should
he
be
so
weak
or
ill
as
to
require
a
servant
to
put
off
and
on
his
clothes
,
there
is
room
enough
in
the
apartment
for
half
a
dozen
people
.
<EOS>
The
guides
who
attend
the
ladies
in
the
water
,
are
of
their
own
sex
,
and
they
and
the
female
bathers
have
a
dress
of
flannel
for
the
sea
;
nay
,
they
are
provided
with
other
conveniencies
for
the
support
of
decorum
.
<EOS>
A
certain
number
of
the
machines
are
fitted
with
tilts
,
that
project
from
the
sea
-
ward
ends
of
them
,
so
as
to
screen
the
bathers
from
the
view
of
all
persons
whatsoever
 
<EOS>
The
beach
is
admirably
adapted
for
this
practice
,
the
descent
being
gently
gradual
,
and
the
sand
soft
as
velvet
;
but
then
the
machines
can
be
used
only
at
a
certain
time
of
the
tide
,
which
varies
every
day
;
so
that
sometimes
the
bathers
are
obliged
to
rise
very
early
in
the
morning
  
For
my
part
<EOS>
,
I
love
swimming
as
an
exercise
,
and
can
enjoy
it
at
all
times
of
the
tide
,
without
the
formality
of
an
apparatus
.
  
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
often
plunged
together
into
the
Isis
;
but
the
sea
is
a
much
more
noble
bath
,
for
health
as
well
as
pleasure
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
conceive
what
a
flow
of
spirits
it
gives
,
and
how
it
braces
every
sinew
of
the
human
frame
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
enumerate
half
the
diseases
which
are
every
day
cured
by
sea
-
bathing
,
you
might
justly
say
you
had
received
a
treatise
,
instead
of
a
letter
,
from
    
your
affectionate
friend
,
and
servant

Scarborough
,
July
1
.
     
<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
found
all
the
benefit
I
expected
at
Scarborough
,
where
I
have
been
these
eight
days
  
<EOS>
From
Harrigate
we
come
hither
by
the
way
of
York
,
where
we
stayed
only
one
day
to
visit
the
Castle
,
the
Minster
,
and
the
Assemblyroom
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
which
was
heretofore
a
fortress
,
is
now
converted
to
a
prison
,
and
is
the
best
,
in
all
respects
,
I
ever
saw
at
home
or
abroad
  
<EOS>
It
stands
in
a
high
situation
,
extremely
well
ventilated
;
and
has
a
spacious
area
within
the
walls
,
for
the
health
;
and
convenience
of
all
the
prisoners
,
except
those
whom
it
is
necessary
to
secure
in
close
confinement
  
<EOS>
Even
these
last
have
all
the
comforts
that
the
nature
of
their
situation
can
admit
.
<EOS>
Here
the
assizes
are
held
,
in
a
rang
;
of
buildings
erected
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
Minster
,
I
know
not
how
to
distinguish
it
,
except
by
its
great
size
and
the
height
of
its
spire
,
from
those
other
ancient
churches
in
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
,
which
used
to
be
called
monuments
of
Gothic
architecture
;
but
it
is
now
agreed
,
that
this
stile
is
Saracen
rather
than
Gothic
;
and
,
I
suppose
,
it
was
first
imported
into
England
from
Spain
,
great
part
of
which
was
under
the
dominion
of
the
Moors
.
<EOS>
Those
British
architects
,
who
adopted
this
stile
,
do
n't
seem
to
have
considered
the
propriety
of
their
adoption
.
<EOS>
The
climate
of
the
coutry
,
possessed
by
the
Moors
or
Saracens
,
both
in
Africa
and
Spain
,
was
so
exceedingly
hot
and
dry
,
that
those
who
built
places
of
worship
for
the
multitude
,
employed
their
talents
in
contriving
edefices
that
should
be
cool
;
and
,
for
this
purpose
,
nothing
could
be
better
adopted
than
those
buildings
;
vast
,
narrow
,
dark
,
and
lofty
,
impervious
to
the
sun
-
beams
,
and
having
little
communication
with
the
scorched
external
atmosphere
;
but
ever
affording
a
refreshing
coolness
,
like
subterranean
cellars
in
the
heats
of
summer
,
or
natural
caverns
in
the
bowels
of
huge
mountains
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
could
be
more
preposterous
,
than
to
imitate
such
a
mode
of
architecture
in
a
country
like
England
,
where
the
climate
is
cold
,
and
the
air
eternally
loaded
with
vapours
;
and
where
,
of
consequence
,
the
builder
's
intention
should
be
to
keep
the
people
dry
and
warm
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
never
entered
the
Abbey
church
at
Bath
but
once
,
and
the
moment
I
stept
over
the
threshold
,
I
found
myself
chilled
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
bones
  
<EOS>
When
we
consider
,
that
in
our
churches
,
in
general
,
we
breathe
a
gross
stagnated
air
,
surcharged
with
damps
from
vaults
,
tombs
,
and
charnel
-
houses
<EOS>
,
may
we
not
term
them
so
many
magazines
of
rheums
,
created
for
the
benefit
of
the
medical
faculty
?
<EOS>
and
safety
aver
,
that
more
bodies
are
lost
,
than
souls
saved
,
by
going
to
church
,
in
the
winter
especially
,
which
may
be
said
to
engross
eight
months
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
,
what
offence
it
would
give
to
tender
consciences
,
if
the
house
of
God
was
made
more
comfortable
,
or
less
dangerous
to
the
health
of
valetudinarians
;
and
whether
it
would
not
be
an
encouragement
to
piety
,
as
well
as
the
salvation
of
many
lives
,
if
the
place
of
worship
was
well
floored
,
wainscotted
,
warmed
,
and
ventilated
,
and
its
area
kept
sacred
from
the
pollution
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
The
practice
of
burying
in
churches
was
the
effect
of
ignorant
superstition
,
influinced
by
knavish
priests
,
who
pretended
that
the
devil
could
have
no
power
over
the
defunct
,
if
he
was
interred
in
holy
ground
;
and
this
,
indeed
,
is
the
only
reason
that
can
be
given
for
consecrating
all
cemeteries
,
even
at
this
day
.
    
<EOS>
The
external
appearance
of
an
old
cathedral
can
not
be
but
displeasing
to
the
eye
of
every
man
who
has
any
idea
of
propriety
and
proportion
,
even
though
he
may
be
ignorant
of
architecture
as
a
science
;
and
the
long
slender
spire
puts
one
in
mind
of
a
criminal
impaled
,
with
a
sharp
stake
rising
up
through
his
shoulder
  
These
towers
,
or
steeples
,
were
likewise
borrowed
from
the
Mahometans
who
,
having
no
bells
,
used
such
minarets
for
the
purpose
of
calling
the
people
to
prayers
  
<EOS>
They
may
be
of
further
use
,
however
,
for
making
observations
and
signals
;
but
I
would
vote
for
their
being
distinct
from
the
body
of
the
church
,
because
they
serve
only
to
make
the
pile
more
barbarous
,
or
Saracencial
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
of
this
Arabic
architecture
in
the
assembly
Room
,
which
seems
to
me
to
have
been
built
upon
a
design
of
Palladio
,
and
might
be
converted
into
an
elegant
place
of
worship
;
but
it
is
indifferently
contrived
for
that
sort
of
idolatry
which
is
performed
in
it
at
present
:
the
grandeur
of
the
fane
gives
a
diminutive
effect
to
the
little
painted
divinities
that
are
adored
in
it
,
and
and
company
,
on
a
ball
night
,
must
look
like
an
assembly
of
fantastic
fairies
,
revelling
by
moonlight
among
the
columns
of
a
Grecian
temple
.
    
<EOS>
Scarborough
seems
to
be
falling
off
,
in
point
of
reputation
  
<EOS>
All
these
places
(
Bath
excepted
)
have
their
vogue
,
and
then
the
fashion
changes
  
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
,
there
are
fifty
spaws
in
England
as
efficatious
and
salutary
as
that
of
Scarborough
,
though
they
have
not
yet
risen
to
fame
;
and
,
perhaps
,
never
will
,
<EOS>
unless
some
medical
encomiast
should
find
an
interest
in
displaying
their
virtues
to
the
public
view
  
Be
that
as
it
may
,
recourse
will
always
be
had
to
this
place
for
the
convenience
of
sea
-
bathing
,
while
this
practise
prevails
;
but
it
were
to
be
wished
,
they
would
make
the
beach
more
accessible
to
invalids
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
here
met
with
my
old
acquaintance
,
H####t
;
whom
you
have
often
heard
me
mention
as
one
of
the
most
original
characters
upon
earth
  
<EOS>
I
first
knew
him
at
Venice
,
and
afterwards
saw
him
in
different
parts
of
Italy
,
where
he
was
well
known
by
the
nick
-
name
of
Cavallo
Bianco
,
from
his
appearing
<EOS>
always
mounted
on
a
pale
horse
,
like
Death
in
the
Revelations
.
<EOS>
You
must
remember
the
account
I
once
gave
you
of
a
curious
dispute
he
had
at
Constantinople
,
with
a
couple
of
Turks
in
defence
of
the
Christian
religion
;
a
dispute
from
which
he
acquired
the
epithet
of
Demonstrator
  
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
H
#
#
#
#
owns
no
religion
but
that
of
nature
;
but
,
on
this
occasion
,
he
was
stimulated
to
shew
his
parts
,
for
the
honour
of
his
country
  
<EOS>
Some
years
ago
,
being
in
the
Campidoglio
at
Rome
,
he
made
up
to
the
bust
of
Jupiter
,
and
,
bowing
very
low
,
exclaimed
in
the
Italian
language
<EOS>
,
"
I
hope
,
sir
,
if
ever
you
get
your
head
above
water
again
,
you
will
remember
that
I
paid
my
respects
to
you
in
your
adversity
.
<EOS>
"
This
sally
was
reported
to
the
cardinal
Camerlengo
,
and
by
him
laid
before
pope
Benedict
XIV
who
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
extravagance
of
the
address
,
and
said
to
the
cardinal
,
"
Those
English
heretics
think
they
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
devil
in
their
own
way
.
"
    
<EOS>
Indeed
H
#
#
#
#
was
the
only
Englishman
I
ever
knew
,
who
had
resolution
enough
to
live
in
his
own
way
,
in
the
midst
of
foreigners
;
for
,
neither
in
dress
,
diet
,
customs
,
or
conversation
,
did
he
deviate
one
title
from
the
manner
in
which
he
had
been
brought
up
.
<EOS>
About
twelve
years
ago
,
he
began
a
Giro
or
circuit
,
which
he
thus
performed
  
<EOS>
At
Naples
,
where
he
fixed
his
headquarters
,
he
embarked
for
Marseilles
,
from
whence
he
travelled
with
a
Voiturin
to
Antibes
  
<EOS>
There
he
took
his
passage
to
Genoa
and
Lorici
;
from
which
last
place
he
proceeded
,
by
the
way
of
Cambratina
,
to
Pisa
and
Florence
  
<EOS>
After
having
halted
some
time
in
this
metropolis
,
he
set
out
with
a
Vetturino
for
Rome
,
where
he
reposed
himself
a
few
weeks
,
and
then
continued
his
route
for
Naples
,
in
order
to
wait
for
the
next
opportunity
of
embarkation
  
After
having
twelve
times
described
this
circle
,
he
lately
flew
off
at
a
tangent
to
visit
some
trees
at
his
country
-
house
in
England
,
which
he
had
planted
above
twenty
years
ago
,
after
the
plan
of
the
double
colonade
in
the
piazza
of
St.
Peter
's
at
Rome
  
<EOS>
He
came
hither
to
Scarborough
,
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
noble
friend
and
former
pupil
,
the
M
#
#
#
#
of
G
#
#
#
#
,
and
,
forgetting
that
he
is
now
turned
of
seventy
,
sacrificed
so
liberally
to
Bacchus
,
that
next
day
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
the
opoplexy
,
which
has
a
little
impaired
his
memory
;
but
he
retains
all
the
oddity
of
his
character
in
perfection
,
and
is
going
back
to
Italy
,
by
the
way
Geneva
,
that
he
may
have
a
conference
with
his
friend
Voltaire
,
about
giving
the
last
blow
to
the
Christian
superstition
  
<EOS>
He
intends
to
take
shipping
here
for
Holland
or
Hamburgh
;
for
it
is
a
matter
of
great
indifference
to
him
at
what
part
of
the
continent
he
first
lands
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
was
going
abraod
the
last
time
,
he
took
his
passage
in
a
ship
bound
for
Leghorn
,
and
his
baggage
was
actually
embarked
.
<EOS>
In
going
down
the
river
by
water
,
he
was
by
mistake
put
on
board
of
another
vessel
under
sail
;
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
understood
she
was
bound
to
Petersburgh
 
"
Petersburgh
,
  
Petersburgh
 
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
if
I
go
along
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
He
forthwith
struck
a
bargain
with
the
captain
;
bought
a
couple
of
shirts
of
the
mate
,
and
was
safe
conveyed
to
the
court
of
Muscovy
,
from
whence
he
travelled
by
land
to
receive
his
baggage
at
Leghorn
  
<EOS>
He
is
now
more
likely
than
ever
to
execute
a
whim
of
the
same
nature
;
and
I
will
hold
any
wager
,
that
as
he
can
not
be
supposed
to
live
much
longer
,
according
to
the
course
of
nature
,
his
exit
will
be
as
odd
as
his
life
has
been
extravagant
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
to
return
from
one
humorist
to
another
;
you
must
know
I
have
received
benefit
,
both
from
the
chalybeate
and
the
sea
,
and
would
have
used
them
longer
,
had
not
a
most
ridiculous
adventure
,
by
making
me
the
town
-
talk
,
obliged
me
to
leave
the
place
;
for
I
ca
n't
bear
the
thoughts
of
affording
a
spectacle
to
the
multitude
  
Yesterday
morning
,
at
six
o'clock
,
I
went
down
to
the
bathing
-
place
,
attended
by
my
servant
Clinker
,
who
waited
on
the
beach
as
usual
  
<EOS>
The
wind
blowing
from
the
north
,
and
the
weather
being
hazy
,
the
water
proved
so
chill
,
that
when
I
rose
from
my
first
plunge
,
I
could
not
help
sobbing
and
bawling
out
,
from
the
effects
of
the
cold
.
<EOS>
Clinker
,
who
heard
me
cry
,
and
saw
me
indistinctly
a
good
way
without
the
guide
,
buffetting
the
waves
,
took
it
for
granted
<EOS>
I
was
drowning
,
and
rushing
into
the
sea
,
cloathes
and
all
,
overturned
the
guide
in
his
hurry
to
save
his
master
.
<EOS>
I
had
swam
out
a
few
strokes
,
when
hearing
a
noise
,
I
turned
about
and
saw
Clinker
,
already
up
to
his
neck
,
advancing
towards
me
,
with
all
the
wildness
of
terror
in
his
aspect
  
<EOS>
Afraid
he
would
get
out
of
his
depth
,
I
made
haste
to
meet
him
,
when
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
seized
me
by
one
ear
,
and
dragged
me
bellowing
with
pain
upon
the
dry
beach
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
the
people
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
there
assembled
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
so
exasperated
by
the
pain
of
my
ear
,
and
the
disgrace
of
being
exposed
in
such
an
attitude
,
that
,
in
the
first
transport
,
I
struck
him
down
;
then
,
running
back
into
the
sea
,
took
shelter
,
in
the
machine
where
my
clothes
had
been
deposited
.
<EOS>
I
soon
recollected
myself
so
far
as
to
do
justice
to
the
poor
fellow
,
who
,
in
great
simplicity
of
heart
,
had
acted
from
motives
of
fidelity
and
affection
  
Opening
the
door
of
the
machine
,
which
was
immediately
drawn
on
shore
,
I
saw
him
standing
by
the
wheel
,
dropping
like
a
water
-
work
,
and
trembling
from
head
to
foot
;
partly
from
cold
,
and
partly
from
the
dread
of
having
offended
his
master
  
<EOS>
I
made
my
acknowledgements
for
the
blow
he
had
received
,
assured
him
I
was
not
angry
,
and
insisted
upon
his
going
home
immediately
,
to
shift
his
clothes
:
a
command
which
he
could
hardly
find
in
his
heart
to
execute
,
so
<EOS>
well
disposed
was
he
to
furnish
the
mob
with
further
entertainment
at
my
expence
.
<EOS>
Clinker
's
intention
was
laudable
without
all
doubt
,
but
,
nevertheless
,
I
am
a
sufferer
by
his
simplicity
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
a
burning
-
heat
,
and
a
strange
buzzing
noise
in
that
ear
,
ever
since
it
was
so
roughly
treated
;
and
I
can
not
walk
the
street
without
being
pointed
at
,
as
the
monster
that
was
hauled
naked
ashore
upon
the
beach
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
affirm
that
folly
is
often
more
provoking
than
knavery
,
aye
and
more
mischievous
too
;
and
whether
a
man
had
not
better
choose
a
sensible
rogue
,
than
an
honest
simpleton
for
his
servant
,
is
no
matter
of
doubt
with
    
yours

DEAR
WATT
,
WE
made
a
precipitate
retreat
from
Scarborough
,
owing
to
the
excess
of
delicacy
of
our
"
squire
,
who
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
being
praetereuntium
digito
monstratus
.
    
<EOS>
One
morning
,
while
he
was
bathing
in
the
sea
,
his
man
Clinker
took
it
in
his
head
,
that
his
master
was
in
danger
of
drowning
;
and
,
in
this
conceit
,
plunging
into
the
water
,
he
lugged
him
out
naked
on
the
beach
,
and
almost
pulled
off
his
ear
in
the
operation
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
this
atchievement
was
relished
by
Mr
Bramble
,
who
is
impatient
,
irascible
,
and
has
the
most
extravagant
ideas
of
decency
and
decorum
in
the
oeconomy
of
his
own
person
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
ebullition
of
his
choler
,
he
knocked
Clinker
down
with
his
fist
;
but
he
afterwards
made
him
amends
for
his
outrage
,
and
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
further
notice
of
the
people
,
among
whom
this
incident
had
made
him
remarkable
,
he
resolved
to
leave
Scarborough
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
We
set
out
accordingly
over
the
moors
,
by
the
way
of
Whitby
,
and
began
our
journey
betimes
,
in
hopes
of
reaching
Stockton
that
night
;
but
in
this
hope
we
were
disappointed
  
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
,
crossing
a
deep
gutter
,
made
by
atorrent
,
the
coach
was
so
hard
strained
,
that
one
of
the
irons
,
which
connect
the
frame
,
snapt
,
and
the
leather
sling
on
the
same
side
,
cracked
in
the
middle
  
<EOS>
The
shock
was
so
great
,
that
my
sister
Liddy
struck
her
headagainst
Mrs
Tabitha
's
nose
with
such
violence
that
the
blood
flowed
:
and
Win
.
<EOS>
Jenkins
was
darted
through
a
small
window
,
in
that
part
of
the
carriage
next
the
horses
,
where
she
stuck
like
a
bawd
in
the
pillory
,
till
she
was
released
by
the
hand
of
Mr
Bramble
.
<EOS>
We
were
eight
miles
distant
from
any
place
where
we
could
be
supplied
with
chaises
,
and
it
was
impossible
to
proceed
with
the
coach
,
until
the
damage
should
be
repaired
  
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
we
discovered
a
black
-
smith
's
forge
on
the
edge
of
a
small
common
,
about
half
a
mile
from
the
scene
of
our
disaster
,
and
thither
the
postilions
made
shift
to
draw
the
carriage
slowly
,
while
the
company
walked
a
-
foot
;
but
we
found
the
black
-
smith
had
been
dead
some
days
;
and
his
wife
,
who
had
been
lately
delivered
,
was
deprived
of
her
senses
,
under
the
care
of
a
nurse
,
hired
by
the
parish
.
<EOS>
We
were
exceedingly
mortified
at
this
disappointment
,
which
,
however
,
was
surmounted
by
the
help
of
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
is
a
surprising
compound
of
genius
and
simplicity
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
tools
of
the
defunct
,
together
with
some
coals
in
the
smithy
,
he
unscrewed
the
damaged
iron
in
a
twinkling
,
and
,
kindling
a
fire
,
united
the
broken
pieces
with
equal
dexterity
and
dispatch
  
While
he
was
at
work
upon
this
operation
,
the
poor
woman
in
the
straw
,
struck
with
the
well
-
known
sound
of
the
hammer
and
anvil
,
started
up
,
and
,
notwithstanding
all
the
nurse
's
efforts
,
came
running
into
the
smithy
,
where
,
throwing
her
arms
about
Clinker
's
neck
,
"
Ah
,
Jacob
!
<EOS>
(
cried
she
)
<EOS>
how
could
you
leave
me
in
such
a
condition
?
"
    
<EOS>
This
incident
was
too
pathetic
to
occasion
mirth
  
<EOS>
it
brought
tears
into
the
eyes
of
all
present
.
<EOS>
The
poor
widow
was
put
to
bed
again
;
and
we
did
not
leave
the
village
without
doing
something
for
her
benefit
  
<EOS>
Even
Tabitha
's
charity
was
awakened
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
tender
-
hearted
Humphry
Clinker
,
he
hammered
the
iron
and
wept
at
the
same
time
  
<EOS>
But
his
ingenuity
was
not
confined
to
his
own
province
of
farrier
and
black
-
smith
  
<EOS>
it
was
necessary
to
join
the
leather
sling
,
which
had
been
broke
;
and
this
service
he
likewise
performed
,
by
means
of
a
broken
awl
,
which
he
new
-
pointed
and
ground
,
a
little
hemp
,
which
he
spun
into
lingels
,
and
a
few
tacks
which
he
made
for
the
purpose
  
Upon
the
whole
<EOS>
,
we
were
in
a
condition
to
proceed
in
a
little
more
than
one
hour
;
but
even
this
delay
obliged
us
to
pass
the
night
at
Gisborough
  
<EOS>
Next
day
we
crossed
the
Tees
at
Stockton
,
which
is
a
neat
agreeable
town
;
and
there
we
resolved
to
dine
,
with
purpose
to
lie
at
Durham
.
    
<EOS>
Whom
should
we
meet
in
the
yard
,
when
we
alighted
,
but
Martin
the
adventurer
?
<EOS>
Having
handed
out
the
ladies
,
and
conducted
them
into
an
apartment
,
where
he
payed
his
compliments
to
Mrs
Tabby
,
with
his
usual
address
,
he
begged
leave
to
speak
to
my
uncle
in
another
room
;
and
there
,
in
some
confusion
,
he
made
an
apology
for
having
taken
the
liberty
to
trouble
him
with
a
letter
at
Stevenage
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
his
hope
,
that
Mr
Bramble
had
bestowed
some
consideration
on
his
unhappy
case
,
and
repeated
his
desire
of
being
taken
into
his
service
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
calling
me
into
the
room
,
told
him
,
that
we
were
both
very
well
inclined
to
rescue
him
from
a
way
of
life
that
was
equally
dangerous
and
dishonourable
;
and
that
he
should
have
no
scruples
in
trusting
to
his
gratitude
and
fidelity
if
he
had
any
employment
for
him
,
which
he
thought
would
suit
his
qualifications
and
his
circumstances
;
but
that
all
the
departments
he
had
mentioned
in
his
letter
,
were
filled
up
by
persons
of
whose
conduct
he
had
no
reason
to
complain
;
of
consequence
he
could
not
,
without
injustice
,
deprive
any
one
of
them
of
his
bread
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
declared
himself
ready
to
assist
him
in
any
feasible
project
,
either
with
his
purse
or
credit
.
    
<EOS>
Martin
seemed
deeply
touched
at
this
declaration
  
<EOS>
The
tear
started
in
his
eye
,
while
he
said
,
in
a
faultering
accent
  
<EOS>
"
Worthy
sir
 
<EOS>
your
generosity
oppresses
me
  
<EOS>
I
never
dreamed
of
troubling
you
for
any
pecuniary
assistance
 
<EOS>
indeed
I
have
no
occasion
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
lucky
at
billiards
and
betting
in
different
places
,
at
Buxton
Harrigate
,
Scarborough
,
and
Newcastle
races
,
that
my
stock
in
ready
-
money
amounts
to
three
hundred
pounds
,
which
I
would
willingly
employ
,
in
prosecuting
some
honest
scheme
of
life
;
but
my
friend
,
justice
Buzzard
,
has
set
so
many
springs
for
my
life
,
that
I
am
under
the
necessity
of
either
retiring
immediately
to
a
remote
part
of
the
country
,
where
I
can
enjoy
the
protection
of
some
generous
patron
,
or
of
quitting
the
kingdom
altogether
  
<EOS>
It
is
upon
this
alternative
that
I
now
beg
leave
to
ask
your
advice
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
information
of
all
your
route
,
since
I
had
the
honour
to
see
you
at
Stevenage
;
and
supposing
you
would
come
this
way
from
Scarborough
<EOS>
,
I
came
hither
last
night
from
Darlington
,
to
pay
you
my
respects
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
provide
you
with
an
asylum
in
the
country
(
replied
my
uncle
;
)
but
a
life
of
indolence
and
obscurity
would
not
suit
with
your
active
and
enterprising
disposition
  
I
would
therefore
advise
you
to
try
your
fortune
in
the
East
Indies
  
I
will
give
you
a
letter
to
a
friend
in
London
,
who
will
recommend
you
to
the
direction
,
for
a
commission
in
the
company
's
service
;
and
if
that
can
not
be
obtained
,
you
will
at
least
be
received
as
a
volunteer
 
in
which
case
,
you
may
pay
for
your
passage
,
and
I
shall
undertake
to
procure
you
such
credentials
,
that
you
will
not
be
long
without
a
commission
.
"
    
<EOS>
Martin
embraced
the
proposal
with
great
eagerness
;
it
was
therefore
resolved
,
that
he
should
sell
his
horse
,
and
take
a
passage
by
sea
for
London
,
to
execute
the
project
without
delay
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
he
accompanied
us
to
Durham
,
where
we
took
up
our
quarters
for
that
night
  
Here
,
being
furnished
with
letters
from
my
uncle
,
he
took
his
leave
of
us
,
with
strong
symptoms
of
gratitude
and
attachment
,
and
set
out
for
Sunderland
,
in
order
to
embark
in
the
first
collier
,
bound
for
the
river
Thames
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
gone
half
an
hour
,
when
we
were
joined
by
another
character
,
which
promised
something
extraordinary
  
A
tall
,
meager
figure
,
answering
,
with
his
horse
,
the
description
of
Don
Quixote
mounted
on
Rozinante
,
appeared
in
the
twilight
at
the
inn
door
,
while
my
aunt
and
Liddy
stood
at
a
window
in
the
dining
-
room
  
<EOS>
He
wore
a
coat
,
the
cloth
of
which
had
once
been
scarlet
,
trimmed
with
Brandenburgs
,
not
totally
deprived
of
their
metal
,
and
he
had
holster
-
caps
and
housing
of
the
same
stuff
and
same
antiquity
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
ladies
at
the
window
above
he
endeavoured
to
dismount
with
the
most
graceful
air
he
could
assume
;
but
the
ostler
neglecting
to
hold
the
stirrup
when
he
wheeled
off
his
right
foot
,
and
stood
with
his
whole
weight
on
the
other
,
the
girth
unfortunately
gave
way
,
the
saddle
turned
,
<EOS>
down
came
the
cavalier
to
the
ground
,
and
his
hat
and
periwig
falling
off
,
displayed
a
head
-
piece
of
various
colours
,
patched
and
plaistered
in
a
woeful
condition
  
<EOS>
The
ladies
,
at
the
window
above
,
shrieked
with
affright
,
on
the
supposition
that
the
stranger
had
received
some
notable
damage
in
his
fall
;
but
the
greatest
injury
he
had
sustained
arose
from
the
dishonour
of
his
descent
,
aggravated
by
the
disgrace
of
exposing
the
condition
of
his
cranium
;
for
certain
plebeians
that
were
about
the
door
,
laughed
aloud
,
in
the
belief
that
the
captain
had
got
either
a
seald
head
,
or
a
broken
head
,
both
equaily
opprobrious
.
    
<EOS>
He
forthwith
leaped
up
in
a
fury
,
and
snatching
one
of
his
pistols
,
threatened
to
put
the
ostler
to
death
,
when
another
squall
from
the
women
checked
his
resentment
.
<EOS>
He
then
bowed
to
the
window
,
while
he
kissed
the
butt
-
end
of
his
pistol
,
which
he
replaced
;
adjusting
his
wig
in
great
confusion
,
and
led
his
horse
into
the
stable
  
By
this
time
I
had
come
to
the
door
,
and
could
not
help
gazing
at
the
strange
figure
that
presented
itself
to
my
view
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
measured
above
six
feet
in
height
,
had
he
stood
upright
;
but
he
stooped
very
much
;
was
very
narrow
in
the
shoulders
,
and
very
thick
in
the
calves
of
his
legs
,
which
were
cased
in
black
spatterdashes
  
As
for
his
thighs
,
they
were
long
and
slender
,
like
those
of
a
grasshopper
;
his
face
was
,
at
least
,
half
a
yard
in
length
,
brown
and
shrivelled
,
with
projecting
cheek
-
bones
,
<EOS>
little
grey
eyes
on
the
greenish
hue
,
large
hook
-
nose
,
a
pointed
chin
,
a
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
<EOS>
,
very
ill
furnished
with
teeth
,
and
a
high
,
narrow
fore
-
head
,
well
furrowed
with
wrinkles
.
<EOS>
His
horse
was
exactly
in
the
stile
of
its
rider
;
a
resurrection
of
dry
bones
,
which
(
as
we
afterwards
learned
)
<EOS>
he
valued
exceedingly
,
as
the
only
present
he
had
ever
received
in
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
Having
seen
this
favourite
steed
properly
accommodated
in
the
stable
,
he
sent
up
his
compliments
to
the
ladies
,
begging
permission
to
thank
them
in
person
for
the
marks
of
concern
they
had
shewn
at
his
disaster
in
the
court
-
yard
  
<EOS>
As
the
"
squire
said
they
could
not
decently
decline
his
visit
,
he
was
shewn
up
stairs
,
and
paid
his
respects
in
the
Scotch
dialect
,
with
much
formality
  
<EOS>
"
Laddies
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
perhaps
ye
may
be
scandaleezed
at
the
appearance
my
heed
made
,
when
it
was
uncovered
by
accident
;
but
I
can
assure
you
,
the
condition
you
saw
it
in
,
is
neither
the
effects
of
disease
,
nor
of
drunkenness
;
but
an
honest
scar
received
in
the
service
of
my
country
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
gave
us
to
understand
,
that
having
been
wounded
at
Ticonderoga
,
in
America
,
a
party
of
Indians
rifled
him
,
scalped
him
,
broke
his
scull
with
the
blow
of
a
tomahawk
,
and
left
him
for
dead
on
the
field
of
battle
;
but
that
being
afterwards
found
with
signs
of
life
,
he
had
been
cured
in
the
French
hospital
,
though
the
loss
of
substance
could
not
be
repaired
;
so
that
the
scull
was
left
naked
in
several
places
,
and
these
he
covered
with
patches
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
no
hold
by
which
an
Englishman
is
sooner
taken
than
that
of
compassion
  
<EOS>
We
were
immediately
interested
in
behalf
of
this
veteran
  
<EOS>
Even
Tabby
's
heart
was
melted
;
but
our
pity
was
warmed
with
indignation
,
when
we
learned
,
that
in
the
course
of
two
sanguinary
wars
,
he
had
been
wounded
,
maimed
,
mutilated
,
taken
,
and
enslaved
,
without
ever
having
attained
a
higher
rank
than
that
of
lieutenant
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
eyes
gleamed
,
and
his
nether
lip
quivered
,
while
he
exclaimed
,
"
I
vow
to
God
,
sir
,
your
case
is
a
reproach
to
the
service
  
<EOS>
The
injustice
you
have
met
with
is
so
flagrant
 
"
"
I
must
crave
your
pardon
,
sir
,
(
cried
the
other
interrupting
him
)
<EOS>
I
complain
of
no
injustice
  
<EOS>
I
purchased
an
ensigncy
thirty
years
ago
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
service
,
rose
to
be
a
lieutenant
,
according
to
my
seniority
 
"
<EOS>
"
But
in
such
a
length
of
time
,
(
resumed
the
"
squire
)
<EOS>
you
must
have
seen
a
great
many
young
officers
put
over
your
head
 
"
"
Nevertheless
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
cause
to
murmur
  
<EOS>
They
bought
their
preferment
with
their
money
  
<EOS>
I
had
no
money
to
carry
to
market
 
<EOS>
that
was
my
misfortune
;
but
nobody
was
to
blame
 
<EOS>
"
"
What
!
<EOS>
no
friend
to
advance
a
sum
of
money
?
<EOS>
"
(
said
Mr
Bramble
.
)
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
I
might
have
borrowed
money
for
the
purchase
of
a
company
(
answered
the
other
;
)
but
that
loan
must
have
been
refunded
;
and
I
did
not
choose
to
incumber
myself
with
a
debt
of
a
thousand
pounds
,
to
be
payed
from
an
income
of
ten
shillings
a
-
day
.
"
<EOS>
"
So
you
have
spent
the
best
part
of
your
life
,
(
cried
Mr
Bramble
)
<EOS>
your
youth
,
your
blood
,
and
your
constitution
,
amidst
the
dangers
,
the
difficulties
,
the
horrors
and
hardships
of
war
,
for
the
consideration
of
three
or
four
shillings
a
-
day
 
a
consideration
 
"
"
Sir
,
(
replied
the
Scot
,
with
great
warmth
)
<EOS>
you
are
the
man
that
does
me
injustice
,
if
you
say
or
think
I
have
been
actuated
by
any
such
paultry
consideration
  
<EOS>
I
am
a
gentleman
;
and
entered
the
service
as
other
gentlemen
do
,
with
such
hopes
and
sentiments
as
honourable
ambition
inspires
  
If
I
have
not
been
lucky
in
the
lottery
of
life
,
so
neither
do
I
think
myself
unfortunate
  
<EOS>
I
owe
no
man
a
farthing
;
I
can
always
command
a
clean
shirt
,
a
mutton
-
chop
,
and
a
truss
of
straw
;
and
when
I
die
,
I
shall
leave
effects
sufficient
to
defray
the
expence
of
my
burial
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
assured
him
,
he
had
no
intention
to
give
him
the
least
offence
,
by
the
observations
he
had
made
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
spoke
from
a
sentiment
of
friendly
regard
to
his
interest
  
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
thanked
him
with
a
stiffness
of
civility
,
which
nettled
our
old
gentleman
,
who
perceived
that
his
moderation
was
all
affected
;
for
,
whatsoever
his
tongue
might
declare
,
his
whole
appearance
denoted
dissatisfaction
  
<EOS>
In
short
without
pretending
to
judge
of
his
military
merit
,
I
think
I
may
affirm
,
that
this
Caledonian
is
a
self
-
conceited
pedant
,
aukward
,
rude
,
and
disputacious
  
<EOS>
He
has
had
the
benefit
of
a
school
-
education
,
seems
to
have
read
a
good
number
of
books
,
his
memory
is
tenacious
,
and
he
pretends
to
speak
several
different
languages
;
but
he
is
so
addicted
to
wrangling
,
that
he
will
cavil
at
the
clearest
truths
,
and
,
in
the
pride
of
argumentation
,
attempt
to
reconcile
contradictions
  
Whether
his
address
and
qualifications
are
really
of
that
stamp
which
is
agreeable
to
the
taste
of
our
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
,
or
that
indefatigable
maiden
is
determined
to
shoot
at
every
sort
of
game
,
<EOS>
certain
it
is
she
has
begun
to
practise
upon
the
heart
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
favoured
us
with
his
company
to
supper
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
many
other
things
to
say
of
this
man
of
war
,
which
I
shall
communicate
in
a
post
or
two
;
<EOS>
mean
<EOS>
while
,
it
is
but
reasonable
that
you
should
be
indulged
with
some
respite
from
those
weary
lucubrations
of
    
yours

<EOS>
To
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart%
of
Jesus
college
,
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
IN
my
last
I
treated
you
with
a
high
flavoured
dish
,
in
the
character
of
the
Scotch
lieutenant
,
and
I
must
present
him
once
more
for
your
entertainment
.
<EOS>
It
was
our
fortune
to
feed
upon
him
the
best
part
of
three
days
;
and
I
do
not
doubt
that
he
will
start
again
in
our
way
before
we
shall
have
finished
our
northern
excursion
.
<EOS>
The
day
after
our
meeting
with
him
at
Durham
proved
so
tempestuous
that
we
did
not
choose
to
proceed
on
our
journey
;
and
my
uncle
persuaded
him
to
stay
till
the
weather
should
clear
up
,
giving
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
general
invitation
to
our
mess
.
<EOS>
The
man
has
certainly
gathered
a
whole
budget
of
shrewd
observations
,
but
he
brings
them
forth
in
such
an
ungracious
manner
as
would
be
extremely
disgusting
,
if
it
was
not
marked
by
that
characteristic
oddity
which
never
fails
to
attract
the
attention
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
Mr
Bramble
discoursed
,
and
even
disputed
,
on
different
subjects
in
war
,
policy
,
the
belles
lettres
,
law
,
and
metaphysics
;
and
sometimes
they
were
warmed
into
such
altercation
as
seemed
to
threaten
an
abrupt
dissolution
of
their
society
;
but
Mr
Bramble
set
a
guard
over
his
own
irascibility
,
the
more
vigilantly
as
the
officer
was
his
guest
;
and
when
,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
,
he
began
to
wax
warm
,
the
other
prudently
cooled
in
the
same
proportion
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
chancing
to
accost
her
brother
by
the
familiar
diminutive
of
Matt
,
"
Pray
,
sir
,
(
said
the
lieutenant
)
is
your
name
Matthias
?
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
,
it
is
one
of
our
uncle
's
foibles
to
be
ashamed
of
his
name
Matthew
,
because
it
is
puritanical
;
and
this
question
chagrined
him
so
much
,
that
he
answered
,
"
No
,
by
G####d
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
in
a
very
abrupt
tone
of
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
The
Scot
took
umbrage
at
the
manner
of
this
reply
,
and
bristling
up
,
"
If
I
had
known
(
said
he
)
that
you
did
not
care
to
tell
your
name
,
I
should
not
have
asked
the
question
  
<EOS>
The
leddy
called
you
Matt
,
and
I
naturally
thought
it
was
Matthias
:
 
perhaps
,
it
may
be
Methuselah
,
or
Metrodorus
,
or
Metellus
,
or
Mathurinus
,
or
Malthinnus
,
or
Matamoros
,
or
 
"
"
No
,
(
cried
my
uncle
laughing
)
<EOS>
it
is
neither
of
those
,
captain
:
 
<EOS>
my
name
is
Matthew
Bramble
,
at
your
service
  
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
I
have
a
foolish
pique
at
the
name
of
Matthew
,
because
it
favours
of
those
canting
hypocrites
,
who
,
in
Cromwell
's
time
,
christened
all
their
children
by
names
taken
from
the
scripture
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
foolish
pique
,
indeed
,
(
cried
Mrs
Tabby
)
and
even
sinful
,
to
fall
out
with
your
name
because
it
was
taken
from
holy
writ
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
you
to
know
<EOS>
,
you
was
called
after
great
-
uncle
Matthew
ap
Madoc
<EOS>
ap
Meredith
,
esquire
,
of
Llanwysthin
,
in
Montgomeryshire
,
justice
of
the
quorum
,
and
crusty
ruttleorum
,
a
gentleman
of
great
worth
and
property
,
descended
in
a
straight
line
,
by
the
female
side
,
from
LLewellyn
,
prince
of
Wales
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
genealogical
anecdote
seemed
to
make
some
impression
upon
the
North
-
Briton
,
who
bowed
very
low
to
the
descendants
of
Llewellyn
,
and
observed
that
he
himself
had
the
honour
of
a
scriptural
nomination
.
<EOS>
The
lady
expressing
a
desire
of
knowing
his
address
,
he
said
,
he
signed
himself
Lieutenant
Obadiah
Lismahago
;
and
,
in
order
to
assist
her
memory
,
he
presented
her
with
a
slip
of
paper
inscribed
with
these
three
words
,
which
she
repeated
with
great
emphasis
,
declaring
,
it
was
one
of
the
most
noble
and
sonorous
names
she
had
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
Obadiah
was
an
adventitious
appellation
,
derived
from
his
great
grand
-
father
,
who
had
been
one
of
the
original
covenanters
;
but
Lismahago
was
the
family
surname
,
taken
from
a
place
in
Scotland
so
called
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
dropped
some
hints
about
the
antiquity
of
his
pedigree
,
adding
,
with
a
smile
of
self
-
denial
,
Sed
genus
<EOS>
et
proavos
,
et
quae
non
fecimas
ipsi
,
vix
ea
nostra
voco
,
which
quotation
he
explained
in
difference
to
the
ladies
;
and
Mrs
Tabitha
did
not
fail
to
compliment
him
on
his
modesty
in
waving
the
merit
of
his
ancestry
,
<EOS>
adding
that
it
was
the
less
necessary
to
him
,
as
he
had
such
a
considerable
fund
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
She
now
began
to
glew
herself
to
his
favour
with
the
grossest
adulation
.
  
<EOS>
She
expatiated
upon
the
antiquity
and
virtues
of
the
Scotish
nation
,
upon
their
valour
,
probity
,
learning
,
and
politeness
.
  
<EOS>
She
even
descended
to
encomiums
on
his
own
personal
address
,
his
gallantry
,
good
sense
,
and
erudition
.
  
<EOS>
She
appealed
to
her
brother
,
whether
the
captain
was
not
the
very
image
of
our
cousin
governor
Griffith
.
  
<EOS>
She
discovered
a
surprizing
eagerness
to
know
the
particulars
of
his
life
,
and
asked
a
thousand
questions
concerning
his
atchievements
in
war
;
all
which
Mr
Lismahago
answered
with
a
sort
of
jesuitical
reserve
,
affecting
a
reluctance
to
satisfy
her
curiosity
on
a
subject
that
concerned
his
own
exploits
.
    
<EOS>
By
dint
of
her
interrogations
,
however
,
we
learned
,
that
he
and
ensign
Murphy
had
made
their
escape
from
the
French
hospital
at
Montreal
,
and
taken
to
the
woods
,
in
hope
of
reaching
some
English
settlement
;
but
mistaking
their
route
,
they
fell
in
with
a
party
of
Miamis
,
who
carried
them
away
in
captivity
.
<EOS>
The
intention
of
these
Indians
was
to
give
one
of
them
as
an
adopted
son
to
a
venerable
sachem
,
who
had
lost
his
own
in
the
course
of
the
war
,
and
to
sacrifice
the
other
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
.
<EOS>
Murphy
,
as
being
the
younger
and
handsomer
of
the
two
,
was
designed
to
fill
the
place
of
the
deceased
,
not
only
as
the
son
of
the
sachem
,
but
as
the
spouse
of
a
beautiful
squaw
,
to
whom
his
predecessor
had
been
betrothed
;
but
in
passing
through
the
different
whigwhams
or
villages
of
the
Miamis
,
poor
Murphy
was
so
mangled
by
the
women
and
children
,
who
have
the
privilege
of
torturing
all
prisoners
in
their
passage
,
that
,
by
the
time
they
arrived
at
the
place
of
the
sachem
's
residence
,
he
was
rendered
altogether
unfit
for
the
purposes
of
marriage
:
it
was
determined
therefore
,
in
the
assembly
of
the
warriors
that
ensign
Murphy
should
be
brought
to
the
stake
,
and
that
the
lady
should
be
given
to
lieutenant
Lismahago
,
who
had
likewise
received
his
share
of
torments
,
though
they
had
not
produced
emasculation
.
  
<EOS>
A
joint
of
one
finger
had
been
cut
,
or
rather
sawed
off
with
a
rusty
knife
;
one
of
his
great
toes
was
crushed
into
a
mass
betwixt
two
stones
;
some
of
his
teeth
were
drawn
,
or
dug
out
with
a
crooked
nail
;
splintered
reeds
had
been
thrust
up
his
nostrils
and
other
tender
parts
;
and
the
calves
of
his
legs
had
been
blown
up
with
mines
of
gunpowder
dug
in
the
flesh
with
the
sharp
point
of
a
tomahawk
.
    
<EOS>
The
Indians
themselves
allowed
that
Murphy
died
with
great
heroism
,
singing
,
as
his
death
song
,
the
drimmendoo
,
in
concert
with
Mr
Lismahago
,
who
was
present
at
the
solemnity
.
<EOS>
After
the
warriors
and
the
matrons
had
made
a
hearty
meal
upon
the
muscular
flesh
which
they
pared
from
the
victim
,
and
had
applied
a
great
variety
of
tortures
,
which
he
bore
without
flinching
,
an
old
lady
,
with
a
sharp
knife
,
scooped
out
one
of
his
eyes
,
and
put
a
burning
coal
in
the
socket
.
<EOS>
The
pain
of
this
operation
was
so
exquisite
that
he
could
not
help
bellowing
,
upon
which
the
audience
raised
a
shout
of
exultation
,
and
one
of
the
warriors
stealing
behind
him
,
gave
him
the
coup
de
grace
with
a
hatchet
.
    
<EOS>
Lismahago
's
bride
,
the
squaw
Squinkinacoosta
,
distinguished
herself
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
She
shewed
a
great
superiority
of
genius
in
the
tortures
which
she
contrived
and
executed
with
her
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
She
vied
with
the
stoutest
warrior
in
eating
the
flesh
of
the
sacrifice
;
and
after
all
the
other
females
were
fuddled
with
dram
-
drinking
,
she
was
not
so
intoxicated
but
that
she
was
able
to
play
the
game
of
the
platter
with
the
conjuring
sachem
,
and
afterwards
go
through
the
ceremony
of
her
own
wedding
,
which
was
consummated
that
same
evening
.
<EOS>
The
captain
had
lived
very
happily
with
this
accomplished
squaw
for
two
years
,
during
which
she
bore
him
a
son
,
who
is
now
the
representative
of
his
mother
's
tribe
;
but
,
at
length
,
to
his
unspeakable
grief
,
she
had
died
of
a
fever
,
occasioned
by
eating
too
much
raw
bear
,
which
they
had
killed
in
a
hunting
excursion
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Mr
Lismahago
was
elected
sachem
,
acknowledged
first
warrior
of
the
Badger
tribe
,
and
dignified
with
the
name
or
epithet
of
Occacanastaogarora
,
which
signifies
nimble
as
a
weasel
;
but
all
these
advantages
and
honours
he
was
obliged
to
resign
,
in
consequence
of
being
exchanged
for
the
orator
of
the
community
,
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
by
the
Indians
that
were
in
alliance
with
the
English
.
<EOS>
At
the
peace
,
he
had
sold
out
upon
half
-
pay
,
and
was
returned
to
Britain
,
with
a
view
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
life
in
his
own
country
,
where
he
hoped
to
find
some
retreat
where
his
slender
finances
would
afford
him
a
decent
subsistence
.
<EOS>
Such
are
the
out
-
lines
of
Mr
Lismahago
's
history
,
to
which
Tabitha
did
seriously
incline
her
ear
;
 
indeed
<EOS>
,
she
seemed
to
be
taken
with
the
same
charms
that
captivated
the
heart
of
desdemona
,
who
loved
the
Moor
for
the
dangers
he
had
passed
.
    
<EOS>
The
description
of
poor
Murphy
's
sufferings
,
which
threw
my
sister
Liddy
into
a
swoon
,
extracted
some
sighs
from
the
breast
of
Mrs
Tabby
:
when
she
understood
he
had
been
rendered
unfit
for
marriage
,
she
began
to
spit
,
and
ejaculated
,
"
Jesus
,
what
cruel
barbarians
!
"
<EOS>
and
she
made
wry
faces
at
the
lady
's
nuptial
repast
;
but
she
was
eagerly
curious
to
know
the
particulars
of
her
marriage
-
dress
;
whether
she
wore
high
breasted
stays
or
boddice
,
a
robe
of
silk
or
velvet
,
and
laces
of
Mechlin
or
minionette
 
<EOS>
she
supposed
,
as
the
were
connected
with
the
French
,
she
used
rouge
,
and
had
her
hair
dressed
in
the
Parisian
fashion
.
<EOS>
The
captain
would
have
declined
giving
a
categorical
explanation
of
all
these
particulars
,
observing
,
in
general
,
that
the
Indians
were
too
tenacious
of
their
own
customs
to
adopt
the
modes
of
any
nation
whatsoever
:
he
said
,
moreover
,
that
neither
the
simplicity
of
their
manners
,
nor
the
commerce
of
their
country
,
would
admit
of
those
articles
of
luxury
which
are
deemed
magnificence
in
Europe
;
and
that
they
were
too
virtuous
and
sensible
to
encourage
the
introduction
of
any
fashion
which
might
help
to
render
them
corrupt
and
effeminate
.
    
<EOS>
These
observations
served
only
to
inflame
her
desire
of
knowing
the
particulars
about
which
she
had
enquired
;
and
,
with
all
his
evasion
,
he
could
not
help
discovering
the
following
circumstances
 
that
his
princess
had
neither
shoes
,
stockings
,
shift
,
nor
any
kind
of
linen
 
that
her
bridal
dress
consisted
of
a
petticoat
of
red
bays
,
and
a
fringed
blanket
,
fastened
about
her
shoulders
with
a
copper
skewer
;
but
of
ornaments
she
had
great
plenty
.
  
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
curiously
plaited
,
and
interwoven
with
bobbins
of
human
bone
 
<EOS>
one
eylid
was
painted
green
,
and
the
other
yellow
;
the
cheeks
were
blue
,
the
lips
white
,
the
teeth
red
,
and
there
was
a
black
list
drawn
down
the
middle
of
the
forehead
as
far
as
the
tip
of
the
nose
 
a
couple
of
gaudy
parrot
's
feathers
were
stuck
through
the
division
of
the
nostrils
 
there
was
a
blue
stone
set
in
the
chin
 
<EOS>
her
ear
-
rings
consisted
of
two
pieces
of
hickery
,
of
the
size
and
shape
of
drumsticks
 
<EOS>
her
arms
and
legs
were
adorned
with
bracelets
of
wampum
 
her
breast
glittered
with
numerous
strings
of
glass
beads
  
<EOS>
she
were
a
curious
pouch
,
or
pocket
,
of
woven
grass
,
elegantly
painted
with
various
colours
 
about
her
neck
<EOS>
was
hung
the
fresh
scalp
of
a
Mohawk
warrior
,
whom
her
deceased
lover
had
lately
slain
in
battle
 
and
finally
,
she
was
anointed
from
head
to
foot
with
bear
's
grease
,
which
sent
forth
a
most
agreable
odour
.
    
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
that
these
paraphernalia
would
not
have
been
much
admired
by
a
modern
fine
lady
;
but
Mrs
Tabitha
was
resolved
to
approve
of
all
the
captain
's
connections
.
  
<EOS>
She
wished
,
indeed
,
the
squaw
had
been
better
provided
with
linen
;
but
she
owned
there
was
much
taste
and
fancy
in
her
ornaments
;
she
made
no
doubt
,
therefore
,
that
madam
Squinkinacoosta
was
a
young
lady
of
good
sense
and
rare
accomplishments
,
and
a
good
christian
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
Then
she
asked
whether
his
consort
had
been
high
-
church
or
low
-
church
,
presbyterian
or
anabaptist
,
or
had
been
favoured
with
any
glimmering
of
the
new
light
of
the
gospel
!
<EOS>
When
he
confessed
that
she
and
her
whole
nation
were
utter
strangers
to
the
christian
faith
,
she
gazed
at
him
with
signs
of
astonishment
,
and
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
chanced
to
be
in
the
room
uttered
a
hollow
groan

After
some
pause
,
"
In
the
name
of
God
,
captain
Lismahago
,
(
cried
she
)
<EOS>
what
religion
do
they
profess
?
"
<EOS>
"
As
to
religion
,
madam
,
(
answered
the
lieutenant
)
it
is
among
those
Indians
a
matter
of
great
simplicity
 
they
never
heard
of
any
Alliance
between
Church
and
State
.
  
<EOS>
They
in
general
,
worship
two
contending
principles
;
one
the
fountain
of
all
Good
,
the
other
the
source
of
evil
.
  
<EOS>
The
common
people
there
,
as
in
other
countries
,
run
into
the
absurdities
of
superstition
;
but
sensible
men
pay
adoration
to
a
Supreme
Being
,
who
created
and
sustains
the
universe
.
"
<EOS>
"
O
!
<EOS>
what
pity
,
(
exclaimed
the
pious
Tabby
)
that
some
holy
man
has
not
been
inspired
to
go
and
convert
these
poor
heathens
!
"
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
told
her
,
that
while
he
resided
among
them
,
two
French
missionaries
arrived
,
in
order
to
convert
them
to
the
catholic
religion
;
but
when
they
talked
of
mysteries
and
revelations
,
which
they
could
neither
explain
nor
authenticate
,
and
called
in
the
evidence
of
miracles
which
they
believed
upon
hearsay
:
when
they
taught
,
that
the
Supreme
Creator
of
Heaven
and
Earth
had
allowed
his
only
son
,
his
own
equal
in
power
and
glory
to
enter
the
bowels
of
a
woman
,
to
be
born
as
a
human
creature
,
to
be
insulted
,
flagellated
,
and
even
executed
as
a
malefactor
;
when
they
pretended
to
create
God
himself
,
to
swallow
,
digest
,
revive
,
and
multiply
him
ad
infinitum
,
by
the
help
of
a
little
flour
and
water
,
the
Indians
were
shocked
at
the
impiety
of
their
presumption
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
examined
by
the
assembly
of
the
sachems
,
who
desired
them
to
prove
the
divinity
of
their
mission
by
some
miracle
.
  
<EOS>
They
answered
,
that
it
was
not
in
their
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
really
sent
by
Heaven
for
our
conversion
,
(
said
one
of
the
sachems
)
<EOS>
you
would
certainly
have
some
supernatural
endowments
,
at
least
you
would
have
the
gift
of
tongues
,
in
order
to
explain
your
doctrine
;
to
the
different
nations
among
which
you
are
employed
;
but
you
are
so
ignorant
of
our
language
that
you
can
not
express
yourselves
even
on
the
most
trifling
subjects
.
"
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
assembly
were
convinced
of
their
being
cheats
,
and
even
suspected
them
of
being
spies
:
  
<EOS>
They
ordered
them
a
bag
of
Indian
corn
a
-
piece
,
and
apointed
a
guide
to
conduct
them
to
the
frontiers
;
but
the
millionaires
having
more
zeal
than
discretion
,
refused
to
quit
the
vineyard
.
  
<EOS>
They
persisted
in
saying
mass
,
in
preaching
,
baptizing
,
and
squabbling
with
the
conjurers
,
or
priests
of
the
country
,
till
they
had
thrown
the
whole
community
into
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
assembly
proceeded
to
try
them
as
impious
impostors
,
who
represented
the
Almighty
as
a
trifling
,
weak
,
capricious
being
,
and
pretended
to
make
,
unmake
,
and
reproduce
him
at
pleasure
:
they
were
,
therefore
,
convicted
of
blasphemy
and
sedition
,
and
condemned
to
the
stake
,
where
they
died
singing
salve
regina
,
in
a
rapture
of
joy
,
for
the
crown
of
martyrdom
which
they
had
thus
obtained
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
conversation
,
lieutenant
Lismahago
dropt
some
hints
by
which
it
appeared
he
himself
was
a
free
-
thinker
.
<EOS>
Our
aunt
seemed
to
be
startled
at
certain
sarcasms
he
threw
out
against
the
creed
of
saint
Athanasius
.
  
<EOS>
He
dwelt
much
upon
the
words
,
reason
,
philosophy
,
and
contradiction
in
terms
 
he
bid
defiance
to
the
eternity
of
hell
-
fire
;
and
even
threw
such
squibs
at
the
immortality
of
the
soul
,
as
singed
a
little
the
whiskers
of
Mrs
Tabitha
's
faith
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
she
began
to
look
upon
Lismahago
as
a
prodigy
of
learning
and
sagacity
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
could
be
no
longer
insensible
to
the
advances
she
made
towards
his
affection
;
and
although
there
was
something
repulsive
in
his
nature
,
he
overcame
it
so
far
as
to
make
some
return
to
her
civilities
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
he
thought
it
would
be
no
bad
scheme
,
in
a
superannuated
lieutenant
on
half
-
pay
,
to
effect
a
conjunction
with
an
old
maid
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
had
fortune
enough
to
keep
him
easy
and
comfortable
in
the
fag
-
end
of
his
days
.
  
<EOS>
An
ogling
correspondence
forthwith
commenced
between
this
amiable
pair
of
originals
.
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
sweeten
the
natural
accidity
of
his
discourse
with
the
treacle
of
compliment
and
commendation
.
  
<EOS>
He
from
time
to
time
offered
her
snuff
,
of
which
he
himself
took
great
quantities
,
and
even
made
her
a
present
of
a
purse
of
silk
grass
,
woven
by
the
hands
of
the
amiable
Squinkinacoosta
,
who
had
used
it
as
a
shot
-
pouch
in
her
hunting
-
expeditions
.
    
<EOS>
From
Doncaster
northwards
,
all
the
windows
of
all
the
inns
are
scrawled
with
doggrel
rhimes
,
in
abuse
of
the
Scotch
nation
;
and
what
surprised
me
very
much
,
I
did
not
perceive
one
line
written
in
the
way
of
recrimination
  
<EOS>
Curious
to
hear
what
Lismahago
would
say
on
this
subject
<EOS>
,
I
pointed
out
to
him
a
very
scurrilous
epigram
against
his
countrymen
,
which
was
engraved
on
one
of
the
windows
of
the
parlour
where
we
sat
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
it
with
the
most
starched
composure
;
and
when
I
asked
his
opinion
of
the
poetry
,
"
It
is
vara
terse
and
vara
poignant
(
he
said
)
;
but
with
the
help
of
a
wat
dish
-
clout
it
might
be
rendered
more
clear
and
parspicous
.
  
<EOS>
I
marvel
much
that
some
modern
wit
has
not
published
a
collection
of
these
essays
under
the
title
of
the
Glazier
's
Triumph
over
Sawney
the
Scot
  
<EOS>
I
'm
persuaded
it
would
be
a
vara
agreeable
offering
to
the
patriots
of
London
and
Westminster
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
expressed
some
surprize
that
the
natives
of
Scotland
,
who
travel
this
way
,
had
not
broke
all
the
windows
upon
the
road
,
"
With
submission
,
(
replied
the
lieutenant
)
<EOS>
that
were
but
<EOS>
shallow
Policy
 
<EOS>
it
would
only
serve
to
make
the
satire
more
cutting
and
severe
;
and
,
I
think
,
it
is
much
better
to
let
it
stand
in
the
window
,
than
have
it
presented
in
the
reckoning
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
jaws
began
to
quiver
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
the
scribblers
of
such
infamous
stuff
deserved
to
be
scourged
at
the
cart
's
tail
for
disgracing
their
country
with
such
monuments
of
malice
and
stupidity
.
  
<EOS>
"
These
vermin
(
said
he
)
do
not
consider
,
that
they
are
affording
their
fellow
-
subjects
,
whom
they
abuse
,
continual
matter
of
self
-
gratulation
,
as
well
as
the
means
of
executing
the
most
manly
vengeance
that
can
be
taken
for
such
low
,
illiberal
attacks
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
admire
the
philosophic
forbearance
of
the
Scots
,
as
much
as
I
despise
the
insolence
of
those
wretched
libellers
,
which
is
a
kin
to
the
arrogance
of
the
village
cock
,
who
never
crows
but
upon
his
own
dunghill
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
captain
,
with
an
affectation
of
candour
,
observed
,
that
men
of
illeberal
minds
were
produced
in
every
soil
;
that
in
supposing
those
were
the
sentiments
of
the
English
in
general
,
he
should
pay
too
great
a
compliment
to
his
own
country
,
which
was
not
of
consequence
enough
to
attract
the
envy
of
such
a
flourishing
and
powerful
people
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabby
broke
forth
again
in
praise
of
his
moderation
,
and
declared
that
Scotland
was
the
soil
which
produced
every
virtue
under
heaven
.
  
<EOS>
When
Lismahago
took
his
leave
for
the
night
,
she
asked
her
brother
if
the
captain
was
not
the
prettiest
gentleman
he
had
ever
seen
;
and
whether
there
was
not
something
wonderfully
engaging
in
his
aspect
?
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
having
eyed
her
some
time
in
silence
,
"
Sister
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
is
,
for
aught
I
know
,
an
honest
man
,
and
a
good
officer
 
he
has
a
considerable
share
of
understanding
,
and
a
title
to
more
encouragement
than
he
seems
to
have
met
with
in
life
;
but
I
can
not
,
with
a
safe
conscience
,
affirm
,
that
he
is
the
prettiest
gentleman
I
ever
saw
;
neither
can
I
discern
any
engaging
charm
in
his
countenance
,
which
,
I
vow
to
Gad
,
is
,
on
the
contrary
,
very
hard
favoured
and
forbidding
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
have
endeavoured
to
ingratiate
myself
with
this
North
-
Briton
,
who
is
really
a
curiosity
;
but
he
has
been
very
shy
of
my
conversation
ever
since
I
laughed
at
his
asserting
that
the
English
tongue
was
spoke
with
more
propriety
at
Edinburgh
than
at
London
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
me
with
a
double
squeeze
of
souring
in
his
aspect
,
"
If
the
old
definition
be
true
,
(
said
he
)
that
risibility
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
a
rational
creature
,
the
English
are
the
most
distinguished
for
rationality
of
any
people
I
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
"
I
owned
that
the
English
were
easily
struck
with
any
thing
that
appeared
ludicrous
,
and
apt
to
laugh
accordingly
;
but
it
did
not
follow
,
that
,
because
they
were
more
given
to
laughter
,
they
had
more
rationality
than
their
neighbours
:
I
said
,
such
an
inference
would
be
an
injury
to
the
Scots
,
who
were
by
no
means
defective
in
rationality
,
though
generally
supposed
little
subject
to
the
impressions
of
humour
.
    
<EOS>
The
captain
answered
,
that
this
supposition
must
have
been
deduced
either
from
their
conversation
or
their
compositions
,
of
which
the
English
could
not
possibly
judge
with
precision
,
as
they
did
not
understand
the
dialect
used
by
the
Scots
in
common
discourse
,
as
well
as
in
their
works
of
humour
.
<EOS>
When
I
desired
to
know
that
those
works
of
humour
were
,
he
mentioned
a
considerable
number
of
pieces
,
which
he
insisted
were
equal
in
point
of
humour
to
any
thing
extant
in
any
language
dead
or
living
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
in
particular
,
recommended
a
collection
of
detached
poems
,
in
two
small
volumes
,
intituled
,
The
Ever
-
green
,
and
the
works
of
Allan
Ramsay
,
which
I
intend
to
provide
myself
with
at
Edinburgh
.
  
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
a
North
-
Briton
is
seen
to
a
disadvantage
in
an
English
company
,
because
he
speaks
in
a
dialect
that
they
ca
n't
relish
,
and
in
a
phraseology
which
they
do
n't
understand
.
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
finds
himself
under
a
restraint
,
which
is
a
great
enemy
to
wit
and
humour
.
  
<EOS>
These
are
faculties
which
never
appear
in
full
lustre
,
but
when
the
mind
is
perfectly
at
ease
,
and
,
as
an
excellent
writer
says
,
enjoys
her
elbow
-
room
.
    
<EOS>
He
proceeded
to
explain
his
assertion
that
the
English
language
was
spoken
with
greater
propriety
at
Edinburgh
than
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
what
we
generally
called
the
Scottish
dialect
was
,
in
fact
,
true
,
genuine
old
English
,
with
a
mixture
of
some
French
terms
and
idioms
,
adopted
in
a
long
intercourse
betwixt
the
French
and
Scotch
nations
;
that
the
modern
English
,
from
affectation
and
false
refinement
,
had
weakened
,
and
even
corrupted
their
language
,
by
throwing
out
the
guttural
sounds
,
altering
the
pronounciation
and
the
quantity
,
and
disusing
many
words
and
terms
of
great
significance
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
these
innovations
,
the
works
of
our
best
poets
,
such
as
Chaucer
,
Spenser
,
and
even
Shakespeare
,
were
become
,
in
many
parts
,
unintelligible
to
the
natives
of
South
-
Britain
,
whereas
the
Scots
,
who
retain
the
ancient
language
,
understand
them
without
the
help
of
a
glossary
.
"
<EOS>
For
instance
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
how
have
your
commentators
been
puzzled
by
the
following
expression
in
the
Tempest
 
<EOS>
He
's
gentle
and
not
fearful
;
as
if
it
was
a
paralogism
to
say
,
that
being
gentle
,
he
must
of
course
be
courageous
:
but
the
truth
is
,
one
of
the
original
meanings
if
not
the
sole
meaning
,
of
that
word
was
,
noble
,
high
-
minded
;
and
to
this
day
a
Scotch
woman
,
in
the
situation
of
the
young
lady
in
the
Tempest
,
would
express
herself
nearly
in
the
same
terms
 
Do
n't
provoke
him
;
for
being
gentle
,
that
is
high
spirited
,
he
wo
n't
tamely
bear
an
insult
.
<EOS>
Spenser
,
in
the
very
first
stanza
of
his
Fairy
Queen
,
says
,
"
    
"
A
gentle
knight
was
pricking
on
the
plain
;
"
"
which
knight
,
far
from
being
tame
and
fearful
,
was
so
stout
that
"
"
Nothing
did
he
dread
,
but
ever
was
ydrad
.
"
    
<EOS>
To
prove
that
we
had
impaired
the
energy
of
our
language
by
false
refinement
,
he
mentioned
the
following
words
,
which
,
though
widely
different
in
signification
,
are
pronounced
exactly
in
the
same
manner
 
wright
,
write
,
right
,
rite
;
but
among
the
Scots
,
these
words
are
as
different
in
pronunciation
,
as
they
are
in
meaning
and
orthography
;
and
this
is
the
case
with
many
others
which
he
mentioned
by
way
of
illustration
.
  
<EOS>
He
,
moreover
,
took
notice
that
we
had
(
for
what
reason
he
could
never
learn
)
altered
the
sound
of
our
vowels
from
that
which
is
retained
by
all
the
nations
in
Europe
;
an
alteration
which
rendered
the
language
extremely
difficult
to
foreigners
,
and
made
it
almost
impractible
to
lay
down
general
rules
for
orthography
and
pronunciation
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
the
vowels
were
no
longer
simple
sounds
in
the
mouth
of
an
Englishman
,
who
pronounced
both
i
and
u
as
diphthongs
.
<EOS>
(
Finally
,
he
affirmed
,
that
we
mumbled
our
speech
with
our
lips
and
teeth
,
and
ran
the
words
together
without
pause
or
distinction
,
in
such
a
manner
that
a
foreigner
,
though
he
understood
English
tolerably
well
,
was
often
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
a
Scotchman
to
explain
what
a
native
of
England
had
said
in
his
own
language
.
    
<EOS>
The
truth
of
this
remark
was
confirmed
by
Mr
Bramble
from
his
own
experience
;
but
he
accounted
for
it
on
another
principle
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
the
same
observation
would
hold
in
all
languages
;
that
a
Swiss
talking
French
was
more
easily
understood
than
a
Parisian
,
by
a
foreigner
who
had
not
made
himself
master
of
the
language
;
because
every
language
had
its
peculiar
recitative
,
and
it
would
always
require
more
pains
,
attention
,
and
practice
,
to
acquire
both
the
words
and
the
music
,
than
to
learn
the
words
only
;
and
yet
no
body
would
deny
,
that
the
one
was
imperfect
without
the
other
!
<EOS>
he
therefore
apprehend
,
that
the
Scotchman
and
the
Swiss
were
better
understood
by
learners
,
because
they
spoke
the
words
only
,
without
the
music
,
which
they
could
not
rehearse
.
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
this
check
might
have
damped
the
North
-
Briton
;
but
it
served
only
to
agitate
his
humour
for
disputation
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
if
every
nation
had
its
own
recitative
or
music
,
the
Scots
had
theirs
,
and
the
Scotchman
who
had
not
yet
acquired
the
cadence
of
the
English
,
would
naturally
use
his
own
in
speaking
their
language
;
therefore
,
if
he
was
better
understood
than
the
native
,
his
recitative
must
be
more
intelligible
than
that
of
the
English
;
of
consequence
the
dialect
of
the
Scots
had
an
advantage
over
that
of
their
fellow
-
subjects
,
and
this
was
another
strong
presumption
that
the
modern
English
had
corrupted
their
language
in
the
article
of
pronunciation
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
was
,
by
this
time
,
become
so
polemical
,
that
every
time
he
opened
his
mouth
out
flew
a
paradox
,
which
he
maintained
with
all
the
enthusiasm
of
altercation
;
but
all
his
paradoxes
favoured
strong
of
a
partiality
for
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
He
undertook
to
prove
that
poverty
was
a
blessing
to
a
nation
;
that
oatmeal
was
preferable
to
wheat
-
flour
;
and
that
the
worship
of
Cloacina
,
in
temples
which
admitted
both
sexes
,
and
every
rank
of
votaries
promiscuously
,
was
a
filthy
species
of
idolatry
that
outraged
every
idea
of
delicacy
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
I
did
not
so
much
wonder
at
his
broaching
these
doctrines
,
as
at
the
arguments
,
equally
whimsical
and
ingenious
,
which
he
adduced
in
support
of
them
.
    
<EOS>
In
fine
,
lieutenant
Lismahago
is
a
curiosity
which
I
have
not
yet
sufficiently
perused
;
and
therefore
I
shall
be
sorry
when
we
lose
his
company
,
though
<EOS>
,
God
knows
,
there
is
nothing
very
amiable
in
his
manner
or
disposition
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
goes
directly
to
the
south
-
west
division
of
Scotland
,
and
we
proceed
in
the
road
to
Berwick
,
we
shall
part
to
-
morrow
at
a
place
called
Felton
-
bridge
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
this
separation
will
be
very
grievous
to
our
aunt
Mrs
Tabitha
,
unless
she
has
received
some
flattering
assurance
of
his
meeting
her
again
.
<EOS>
If
I
fail
in
my
purpose
of
entertaining
you
with
these
unimportant
occurrences
,
they
will
at
least
serve
as
exercises
of
patience
,
for
which
you
are
indebted
to

Yours

To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
I
HAVE
now
reached
the
northern
extremity
of
England
,
and
see
,
close
to
my
chamber
-
window
,
the
Tweed
gliding
through
the
arches
of
that
bridge
which
connects
this
suburb
to
the
town
of
Berwick
.
  
<EOS>
Yorkshire
you
have
seen
,
and
therefore
I
shall
say
nothing
of
that
opulent
province
.
<EOS>
The
city
of
Durham
appears
like
a
confused
heap
of
stones
and
brick
,
accumulated
so
as
to
cover
a
mountain
,
round
which
a
river
winds
its
brawling
course
.
<EOS>
The
streets
are
generally
narrow
,
dark
,
and
unpleasant
,
and
many
of
them
almost
impassible
in
consequence
of
their
declivity
.
<EOS>
The
cathedral
is
a
huge
gloomy
pile
;
but
the
clergy
are
well
lodged
.
  
<EOS>
The
bishop
lives
in
a
princely
manner
 
<EOS>
the
golden
prebends
keep
plentiful
tables
 
<EOS>
and
,
I
am
told
,
there
is
some
good
sociable
company
in
the
place
;
but
the
country
,
when
viewed
from
the
top
of
Gateshead
Fell
,
which
extends
to
Newcastle
,
exhibits
the
highest
scene
of
cultivation
that
ever
I
beheld
.
<EOS>
As
for
Newcastle
,
it
lies
mostly
in
a
bottom
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Tyne
,
and
makes
an
appearance
still
more
disagreeable
than
that
of
Durham
;
but
it
is
rendered
populous
and
rich
by
industry
and
commerce
;
and
the
country
lying
on
both
sides
the
river
,
above
the
town
,
yields
a
delightful
prospect
of
agriculture
and
plantation
.
<EOS>
Morpeth
and
Alnwick
are
neat
,
pretty
towns
,
and
this
last
is
famous
for
the
castle
which
has
belonged
so
many
ages
to
the
noble
house
of
Piercy
,
earls
of
Northumberland
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
,
doubtless
,
a
large
edifice
,
containing
a
great
number
of
apartments
,
and
stands
in
a
commanding
situation
;
but
the
strength
of
it
seems
to
have
consisted
not
so
much
in
its
site
,
or
the
manner
in
which
it
is
fortified
,
as
in
the
valour
of
its
defendants
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventures
since
we
left
Scarborough
,
are
scarce
worth
reciting
;
and
yet
I
must
make
you
acquainted
with
my
sister
Tabby
's
progress
in
husband
-
hunting
,
after
her
disappointments
at
Bath
and
London
.
<EOS>
She
had
actually
begun
to
practise
upon
a
certain
adventurer
,
who
was
in
fact
a
highwayman
by
profession
;
but
he
had
been
used
to
snares
much
more
dangerous
than
any
she
could
lay
,
and
escaped
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
Then
she
opened
her
batteries
upon
an
old
weather
-
beaten
Scotch
lieutenant
,
called
Lismahago
,
who
joined
us
at
Durham
,
and
is
,
I
think
,
one
of
the
most
singular
personages
I
ever
encountered
.
  
<EOS>
His
manner
is
as
harsh
as
his
countenance
;
but
his
peculiar
turn
of
thinking
,
and
his
pack
of
knowledge
made
up
of
the
remnants
of
rarieties
,
rendered
his
conversation
desirable
,
in
spite
of
his
pedantry
and
ungracious
address
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
met
with
a
crab
-
apple
in
a
hedge
,
which
I
have
been
tempted
to
eat
for
its
flavour
,
even
while
I
was
disgusted
by
its
austerity
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
contradiction
is
naturally
so
strong
in
Lismahago
,
that
I
believe
in
my
conscience
he
has
rummaged
,
and
read
,
and
studied
with
indefatigable
attention
,
in
order
to
qualify
himself
to
refute
established
maxims
,
and
thus
raise
trophies
for
the
gratification
of
polemical
pride
.
  
<EOS>
Such
is
the
asperity
of
self
-
conceit
,
that
he
will
not
even
acquiesce
in
a
transient
compliment
made
to
his
own
individual
in
particular
,
or
to
his
country
in
general
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
observed
,
that
he
must
have
read
a
vast
number
of
books
to
be
able
to
discourse
on
such
a
variety
of
subjects
,
he
declared
he
had
read
little
or
nothing
,
and
asked
how
he
should
find
books
among
the
woods
of
America
,
where
he
had
spent
the
greatest
part
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
remarking
that
the
Scots
in
general
were
famous
for
their
learning
,
he
denied
the
imputation
,
and
defied
him
to
prove
it
from
their
works
.
  
<EOS>
"
the
Scots
(
said
he
)
have
a
slight
tincture
of
letters
,
with
which
they
make
a
parade
among
people
who
are
more
illiterate
than
themselves
;
but
they
may
be
said
to
float
on
the
surface
of
science
,
and
they
have
made
very
small
advances
in
the
useful
arts
.
"
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
(
cried
Tabby
)
<EOS>
all
the
world
allows
that
the
Scots
behave
gloriously
in
fighting
and
conquering
the
savages
of
America
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
can
assure
you
,
madam
,
you
have
been
misinformed
(
replied
the
lieutenant
)
;
in
that
continent
the
Scots
did
nothing
more
than
their
duty
,
nor
was
there
one
corps
in
his
majesty
's
service
that
distinguished
itself
more
than
another
.
  
<EOS>
Those
who
affected
to
extol
the
Scots
for
superior
merit
,
were
no
friends
to
that
nation
.
"
    
<EOS>
Though
he
himself
made
free
with
his
countrymen
,
he
would
not
suffer
any
other
person
to
glance
a
sarcasm
at
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
company
chancing
to
mention
lord
B
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
's
inglorious
peace
,
the
lieutenant
immediately
took
up
the
cudgels
in
his
lordship
's
favour
,
and
argued
very
strenuously
to
prove
that
it
was
the
most
honourable
and
advantageous
peace
that
England
had
ever
made
since
the
foundation
of
the
monarchy
.
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
between
friends
,
he
offered
such
reasons
on
this
subject
,
that
I
was
really
confounded
,
if
not
convinced
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
not
allow
that
the
Scots
abounded
above
their
proportion
in
the
army
and
navy
of
Great
-
Britain
,
or
that
the
English
had
any
reason
to
say
his
countrymen
had
met
with
extraordinary
encouragement
in
the
service
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
a
South
and
North
-
Briton
(
said
he
)
are
competitors
for
a
place
or
commission
,
which
is
in
the
disposal
of
an
English
minister
or
an
English
general
,
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
the
preference
will
not
be
given
to
the
native
of
England
,
who
has
so
many
advantages
over
his
rival
.
  
<EOS>
First
and
formost
,
he
has
in
his
favour
that
laudable
partiality
,
which
,
Mr
Addison
says
,
never
fails
to
cleave
to
the
heart
of
an
Englishman
;
secondly
,
he
has
more
powerful
connexions
,
and
a
greater
share
of
parliamentary
interest
,
by
which
those
contests
are
generally
decided
;
and
lastly
,
he
has
a
greater
command
of
money
to
smooth
the
way
to
his
success
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
know
no
Scotch
officer
,
who
has
risen
in
the
army
above
the
rank
of
a
subaltern
,
without
purchasing
every
degree
of
preferment
either
with
money
or
recruits
;
but
<EOS>
I
know
many
gentlemen
of
that
country
,
who
,
for
want
of
money
and
interest
,
have
grown
grey
in
the
rank
of
lieutenants
;
whereas
very
few
instances
of
this
ill
-
fortune
are
to
be
found
among
the
natives
of
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
I
would
insinuate
that
my
countrymen
have
the
least
reason
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
Preferment
in
the
service
,
like
success
in
any
other
branch
of
traffic
,
will
naturally
favour
those
who
have
the
greatest
stock
of
cash
and
credit
,
merit
and
capacity
being
supposed
equal
on
all
sides
.
"
    
<EOS>
But
the
most
hardy
of
all
this
original
's
positions
were
these
:
  
That
commerce
would
,
sooner
or
later
,
prove
the
ruin
of
every
nation
,
where
it
flourishes
to
any
extent
  
That
the
parliament
was
the
rotten
part
of
the
British
constitution
 
that
the
liberty
of
the
press
was
a
national
evil
 
and
that
the
boasted
institution
of
juries
,
as
managed
in
England
was
productive
of
shameful
perjury
and
flagrant
injustice
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
traffic
was
an
enemy
to
all
the
liberal
passions
of
the
soul
,
founded
on
the
thirst
of
lucre
,
a
sordid
disposition
to
take
advantage
of
the
necessities
of
our
fellow
-
creatures
.
  
<EOS>
He
affirmed
,
the
nature
of
commerce
was
such
,
that
it
could
not
be
fixed
or
perpetuated
,
but
,
having
slowed
to
a
certain
height
,
would
immediately
begin
to
ebb
,
and
to
continue
till
the
channels
should
be
left
almost
dry
;
but
there
was
no
instance
of
the
tide
's
rising
a
second
time
to
any
considerable
influx
in
the
same
nation
.
<EOS>
Mean
while
the
sudden
affluence
occasioned
by
trade
,
forced
open
all
the
sluices
of
luxury
,
and
overflowed
the
land
with
every
species
of
profligacy
and
corruption
,
a
total
pravity
of
manners
would
ensue
,
and
this
must
be
attended
with
bankruptcy
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
He
observed
of
the
parliament
,
that
the
practice
of
buying
boroughs
,
and
canvassing
for
votes
,
was
an
avowed
system
of
venality
,
already
established
on
the
ruins
of
principle
,
integrity
,
faith
,
and
good
order
,
in
consequence
of
which
the
elected
and
the
elector
,
and
,
in
short
,
the
whole
body
of
the
people
,
were
equally
and
universally
contaminated
and
corrupted
.
<EOS>
He
affirmed
,
that
of
a
parliament
thus
constituted
,
the
crown
would
always
have
influence
enough
to
secure
a
great
majority
in
its
dependence
,
from
the
great
number
of
posts
,
places
,
and
pensions
it
had
to
bestow
;
that
such
a
parliament
would
(
as
it
had
already
done
)
<EOS>
lengthen
the
term
of
its
sitting
and
authority
,
whenever
the
prince
should
think
it
for
his
interest
to
continue
the
representatives
;
for
without
doubt
,
they
had
the
same
right
to
protract
their
authority
ad
infinitum
,
as
they
had
to
extend
it
from
three
to
seven
years
  
With
a
parliament
,
therefore
,
dependent
upon
the
crown
,
devoted
to
the
prince
,
and
supported
by
a
standing
army
,
garbled
and
modelled
for
the
purpose
,
<EOS>
any
king
of
England
may
,
and
probably
some
ambitious
sovereign
will
,
totally
overthrow
all
the
bulwarks
of
the
constitution
;
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
prince
of
a
high
spirit
will
tamely
submit
to
be
thwarted
in
all
his
measures
,
abused
and
insulted
by
a
populace
of
unbridled
ferocity
,
when
he
has
it
in
his
power
to
crush
all
opposition
under
his
feet
with
the
concurrence
of
the
legislature
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
should
always
consider
the
liberty
of
the
press
as
a
national
evil
,
while
it
enabled
the
vilest
reptile
to
soil
the
lustre
of
the
most
shining
merit
,
and
furnished
the
most
infamous
incendiary
with
the
means
of
disturbing
the
peace
,
and
destroying
the
good
order
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
He
owned
,
however
,
that
,
under
due
restrictions
,
it
would
be
a
valuable
privilege
;
but
affirmed
,
that
at
present
there
was
a
no
law
in
England
sufficient
to
restrain
it
within
proper
bounds
,
    
With
respect
to
juries
,
he
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
:
  
<EOS>
Juries
are
generally
composed
of
illiterate
plebeians
,
apt
to
be
mistaken
,
easily
misled
,
and
open
to
sinister
influence
;
for
if
either
of
the
parties
to
be
tried
,
can
gain
over
one
of
the
twelve
jurors
,
he
has
secured
the
verdict
in
his
favour
;
the
jurymen
thus
brought
over
,
will
,
in
despight
of
all
evidence
and
conviction
,
generally
hold
out
till
his
fellows
are
fatigued
,
and
harassed
,
and
starved
into
concurrence
;
in
which
case
the
verdict
is
unjust
,
and
the
jurors
are
all
perjured
:
but
cases
will
often
occur
,
when
the
jurors
are
really
divided
in
opinion
,
and
each
side
is
convinced
in
opposition
to
the
other
;
but
no
verdict
will
be
received
,
unless
they
are
unanimous
,
and
they
are
all
bound
,
not
only
in
conscience
,
but
by
oath
,
to
judge
and
declare
according
to
their
conviction
.
  
<EOS>
What
then
will
be
the
consequence
?
  
<EOS>
They
must
either
starve
in
company
,
or
one
side
must
sacrifice
their
conscience
to
their
convenience
,
and
join
in
a
verdict
which
they
believe
to
be
false
.
<EOS>
This
absurdity
is
avoided
in
Sweden
,
where
a
bare
majority
is
sufficient
;
and
in
Scotland
,
where
two
thirds
of
the
jury
are
required
to
concur
in
the
verdict
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
not
imagine
that
all
these
deductions
were
made
on
his
part
,
without
contradiction
on
mine
 
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
the
truth
is
,
I
found
myself
piqued
in
point
of
honour
,
at
his
pretending
to
be
so
much
wiser
than
his
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
I
questioned
all
his
assertions
,
started
innumerable
objections
,
argued
and
wrangled
with
uncommon
perseverance
,
and
grew
very
warm
,
and
even
violent
in
the
debate
.
  
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
was
puzzled
,
and
once
or
twice
,
I
think
,
fairly
refuted
;
but
from
those
falls
he
rose
again
,
like
Antaeus
,
with
redoubled
vigour
,
till
at
length
<EOS>
I
was
tired
,
exhausted
,
and
really
did
not
know
how
to
proceed
,
when
luckily
he
dropped
a
hint
,
by
which
he
discovered
he
had
been
bred
to
the
law
;
a
confession
which
enabled
me
to
retire
from
the
dispute
with
a
good
grace
,
as
it
could
not
be
supposed
that
a
man
like
me
,
who
had
been
bred
to
nothing
,
should
be
able
to
cope
with
a
veteran
in
his
own
profession
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
however
,
that
I
shall
for
some
time
continue
to
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
upon
many
observations
which
this
original
discharged
.
    
<EOS>
Whether
our
sister
Tabby
was
really
struck
with
his
conversation
,
or
is
resolved
to
throw
at
every
thing
she
meets
in
the
shape
of
a
man
,
till
she
can
fasten
the
matrimonial
noose
,
<EOS>
certain
it
is
,
she
has
taken
desperate
strides
towards
the
affection
of
Lismahago
,
who
can
not
be
said
to
have
met
her
half
way
,
tho
'
he
does
not
seem
altogether
insensible
to
her
civilities
  
<EOS>
She
insinuated
more
than
once
<EOS>
how
happy
we
should
be
to
have
his
company
through
that
part
of
Scotland
which
we
proposed
to
visit
,
<EOS>
till
at
length
he
plainly
told
us
,
that
his
road
was
totally
different
from
that
which
we
intended
to
take
;
that
,
for
his
part
,
his
company
would
be
of
very
little
service
to
us
in
our
progress
,
as
he
was
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
country
,
which
he
had
left
in
his
early
youth
,
consequently
,
he
could
neither
direct
us
in
our
inquiries
,
nor
introduce
us
to
any
family
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
was
stimulated
by
an
irresistible
impulse
to
revisit
the
paternus
lar
,
or
patria
domus
,
though
he
expected
little
satisfaction
,
inasmuch
as
he
understood
that
his
nephew
,
the
present
possessor
,
was
but
ill
qualified
to
support
the
honour
of
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
He
assured
us
,
however
,
as
we
design
to
return
by
the
west
road
,
that
he
will
watch
our
motions
,
and
endeavour
to
pay
his
respects
to
us
at
Dumsries
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
took
his
leave
of
us
at
a
place
half
way
<EOS>
betwixt
Morpeth
and
Alnwick
,
and
pranced
away
in
great
state
,
mounted
on
a
tall
,
meagre
,
raw
-
boned
,
shambling
grey
gelding
,
without
e'er
a
tooth
in
his
head
,
the
very
counter
-
part
of
the
rider
;
and
,
indeed
,
the
appearance
of
the
two
was
so
picturesque
,
that
I
would
give
twenty
guineas
to
have
them
tolerably
represented
on
canvas
.
    
<EOS>
Northumberland
is
a
fine
county
,
extending
to
the
Tweed
,
which
is
a
pleasant
pastoral
stream
;
but
you
will
be
surprised
when
I
tell
you
that
the
English
side
of
that
river
is
neither
so
well
cultivated
nor
so
populous
as
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
The
farms
are
thinly
scattered
,
the
lands
uninclosed
,
and
scarce
a
gentleman
's
seat
is
to
be
seen
in
some
miles
from
the
Tweed
;
whereas
the
Scots
are
advanced
in
crowds
to
the
very
brink
of
the
river
,
so
that
you
may
reckon
above
thirty
good
houses
,
in
the
compass
of
a
few
miles
,
belonging
to
proprietors
whose
ancestors
had
fortified
castles
in
the
same
situations
,
a
circumstance
that
shews
<EOS>
what
dangerous
neighbours
the
Scots
must
have
formerly
been
to
the
northern
counties
of
England
.
    
<EOS>
Our
domestic
oeconomy
continues
on
the
old
footing
  
<EOS>
My
sister
Tabby
still
adheres
to
methodism
,
and
had
the
benefit
of
a
sermon
at
Wesley
's
meeting
in
Newcastle
;
but
I
believe
the
passion
of
love
has
in
some
measure
abated
the
fervour
of
devotion
both
in
her
and
her
woman
,
Mrs
Jenkins
,
about
whose
good
graces
there
has
been
a
violent
contest
betwixt
my
nephew
's
valet
,
Mr
Dutton
,
and
my
man
,
Humphry
Clinker
.
  
<EOS>
Jery
has
been
obliged
to
interpose
his
authority
to
keep
the
peace
;
and
to
him
,
I
have
left
the
discussion
of
that
important
affair
,
which
had
like
to
have
kindled
the
flames
of
discord
in
the
family
of
    
Yours
always

<EOS>
DEAR
WAT
,
IN
my
two
last
<EOS>
you
had
so
much
of
Lismahago
,
that
I
suppose
you
are
glad
he
is
gone
off
the
stage
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
now
descend
to
domestic
occurrences
.
  
<EOS>
Love
,
it
seems
,
is
resolved
to
assert
his
dominion
over
all
the
females
of
our
family
.
  
<EOS>
After
having
practised
upon
poor
Liddy
's
heart
,
and
played
strange
vagaries
with
our
aunt
Mrs
Tabitha
,
he
began
to
run
riot
in
the
affections
of
her
woman
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
whom
I
have
had
occasion
to
mention
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
our
memoirs
.
<EOS>
Nature
intended
Jenkins
for
something
very
different
from
the
character
of
her
mistress
;
yet
custom
and
habit
have
effected
a
wonderful
resemblance
betwixt
them
in
many
particulars
.
<EOS>
Win
,
to
be
sure
,
is
much
younger
and
more
agreeable
in
her
person
;
she
is
likewise
tender
-
hearted
and
benevolent
,
qualities
for
which
her
mistress
is
by
no
means
remarkable
,
no
more
than
she
is
for
being
of
a
timorous
disposition
,
and
much
subject
to
fits
of
the
mother
,
which
are
the
infirmities
of
Win
's
constitution
:
but
then
she
seems
to
have
adopted
Mrs
Tabby
's
manner
with
her
cast
cloaths
.
  
<EOS>
She
dresses
and
endeavours
to
look
like
her
mistress
,
although
her
own
looks
are
much
more
engaging
.
  
<EOS>
She
enters
into
her
scheme
of
oeconomy
,
learns
her
phrases
,
repeats
her
remarks
,
imitates
her
stile
in
scolding
the
inferior
servants
,
and
,
finally
,
subscribes
implicitly
to
her
system
of
devotion
  
<EOS>
This
,
indeed
,
she
found
the
more
agreeable
,
as
it
was
in
a
great
measure
introduced
and
confirmed
by
the
ministry
of
Clinker
,
with
whose
personal
merit
she
seems
to
have
been
struck
ever
since
he
exhibited
the
pattern
of
his
naked
skin
at
Marlborough
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
though
Humphry
had
this
double
hank
upon
her
inclinations
,
and
exerted
all
his
power
to
maintain
the
conquest
he
had
made
,
he
found
it
impossible
to
guard
it
on
the
side
of
vanity
,
where
poor
Win
was
as
frail
as
any
female
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
rascal
Dutton
professed
himself
her
admirer
,
and
,
by
dint
of
his
outlandish
qualifications
,
threw
his
rival
Clinker
out
of
the
saddle
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Humphry
may
be
compared
to
an
English
pudding
,
composed
of
good
wholesome
flour
and
suet
,
and
Dutton
to
a
syllabub
or
iced
froth
,
which
,
though
agreeable
to
the
taste
,
has
nothing
solid
or
substantial
.
<EOS>
The
traitor
not
only
dazzled
her
with
his
second
-
hand
finery
,
but
he
fawned
,
and
flattered
,
and
cringed
 
he
taught
her
to
take
rappee
,
and
presented
her
with
a
snuff
-
box
of
papier
mache
 
<EOS>
he
supplied
her
with
a
powder
for
her
teeth
 
<EOS>
he
mended
her
complexion
,
and
he
dressed
her
hair
in
the
Paris
fashion
 
<EOS>
he
undertook
to
be
her
French
master
and
her
dancing
-
master
,
as
well
as
friseur
,
and
thus
imperceptibly
wound
himself
into
her
good
graces
.
<EOS>
Clinker
perceived
the
progress
he
had
made
,
and
repined
in
secret
.
  
<EOS>
He
attempted
to
open
her
eyes
in
the
way
of
exhortation
,
and
,
finding
it
produced
no
effect
,
had
recourse
to
prayer
.
<EOS>
At
Newcastle
,
while
he
attended
Mrs
Tabby
to
the
methodist
meeting
,
his
rival
accompanied
Mrs
Jenkins
to
the
play
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
silk
coat
,
made
at
Paris
for
his
former
master
,
with
a
tawdry
waistcoat
of
tarnished
brocard
;
he
wore
his
hair
in
a
great
bag
with
a
huge
solitaire
,
and
a
long
sword
dangled
from
his
thigh
.
<EOS>
The
lady
was
all
of
a
flutter
with
faded
lutestring
,
washed
gauze
,
and
ribands
three
times
refreshed
;
but
she
was
most
remarkable
for
the
frisure
of
her
head
,
which
rose
,
like
a
pyramid
,
seven
inches
above
the
scalp
,
and
her
face
was
primed
and
patched
from
the
chin
up
to
the
eyes
;
nay
,
the
gallant
himself
had
spared
neither
red
nor
white
in
improving
the
nature
of
his
own
complexion
.
<EOS>
In
this
attire
,
they
walked
together
through
the
high
street
to
the
theatre
,
and
as
they
passed
for
players
ready
dressed
for
acting
,
they
reached
it
unmolested
;
but
as
it
was
still
light
when
they
returned
,
and
by
that
time
the
people
had
got
information
of
their
real
character
and
condition
,
they
hissed
and
hooted
all
the
way
,
and
Mrs
Jenkins
was
all
bespattered
with
dirt
,
as
well
as
insulted
with
the
opprobious
name
of
painted
Jezabel
,
so
that
her
fright
and
mortification
threw
her
into
an
hysteric
fit
the
moment
she
came
home
.
    
<EOS>
Clinker
was
so
incensed
at
Dutton
,
whom
he
considered
as
the
cause
of
her
disgrace
,
that
he
upbraided
him
severely
for
having
turned
the
poor
young
woman
's
brain
.
<EOS>
The
other
affected
to
treat
him
with
contempt
,
and
mistaking
his
forbearance
for
want
of
courage
,
threatened
to
horse
-
whip
him
into
good
manners
.
<EOS>
Humphry
then
came
to
me
,
humbly
begging
I
would
give
him
leave
to
chastise
my
servant
for
his
insolence
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
challenged
me
to
fight
him
at
sword
's
point
(
said
he
)
;
but
I
might
as
well
challenge
him
to
make
a
horse
-
shoe
,
or
a
plough
-
iron
;
for
I
know
no
more
of
the
one
than
he
does
of
the
other
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
doth
not
become
servants
to
use
those
weapons
,
or
to
claim
the
privilege
of
gentlemen
to
kill
one
another
when
they
fall
out
;
moreover
,
I
would
not
have
his
blood
upon
my
conscience
for
ten
thousand
times
the
profit
or
satisfaction
I
should
get
by
his
death
;
but
if
your
honour
wo
n't
be
angry
,
I
'll
engage
to
gee
'
en
a
good
drubbing
,
that
,
may
hap
,
will
do
'
en
service
,
and
I
'll
take
care
<EOS>
it
shall
do
'
en
no
harm
.
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
I
had
no
objection
to
what
he
proposed
,
provided
he
could
manage
matters
so
as
not
to
be
found
the
aggressor
,
in
case
Dutton
should
prosecute
him
for
an
assault
and
battery
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
licensed
,
he
retired
;
and
that
same
evening
easily
provoked
his
rival
to
strike
the
first
blow
,
which
Clinker
returned
with
such
interest
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
call
for
quarter
,
declaring
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
would
exact
severe
and
bloody
satisfaction
the
moment
we
should
pass
the
border
,
when
he
could
run
him
through
the
body
without
fear
of
the
consequence
.
  
<EOS>
This
scene
passed
in
presence
of
lieutenant
Lismahago
,
who
encouraged
Clinker
to
hazard
a
thrust
of
cold
iron
with
his
antagonist
.
"
<EOS>
Cold
iron
(
cried
Humphry
)
<EOS>
I
shall
never
use
against
the
life
of
any
human
creature
;
but
I
am
so
far
from
being
afraid
of
his
cold
iron
,
that
I
shall
use
nothing
in
my
defence
but
a
good
cudgel
,
which
shall
always
be
at
his
service
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
mean
time
,
the
fair
cause
of
this
contest
;
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
seemed
overwhelmed
with
affliction
,
and
Mr
Clinker
acted
much
on
the
reserve
,
though
he
did
not
presume
to
find
fault
with
her
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
The
dispute
between
the
two
rivals
was
soon
brought
to
a
very
unexpected
issue
.
<EOS>
Among
our
fellow
-
lodgers
at
Berwick
,
was
a
couple
from
London
,
bound
to
Edinburgh
,
on
the
voyage
of
matrimony
.
<EOS>
The
female
was
the
daughter
and
heiress
of
a
pawn
-
broker
deceased
,
who
had
given
her
guardians
the
slip
,
and
put
herself
under
the
tuition
of
a
tall
Hibernian
,
who
had
conducted
her
thus
far
in
quest
of
a
clergyman
to
unite
them
in
marriage
,
without
the
formalities
required
by
the
law
of
England
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
the
lover
had
behaved
on
the
road
,
so
as
to
decline
in
favour
of
his
inamorata
;
but
,
in
all
probability
,
Dutton
perceived
a
coldness
on
her
side
,
which
encouraged
him
to
whisper
,
it
was
a
pity
she
should
have
cast
her
affections
upon
a
taylor
,
which
he
affirmed
the
Irishman
to
be
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
compleated
her
disgust
,
of
which
my
man
taking
the
advantage
,
began
to
recommend
himself
to
her
good
graces
,
and
the
smooth
-
tongued
rascal
found
no
difficulty
to
insinuate
himself
into
the
place
of
her
heart
from
which
the
other
had
been
discarded
.
  
<EOS>
Their
resolution
was
immediately
taken
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
before
day
,
while
poor
Teague
lay
snoring
a
-
bed
,
his
indefatigable
rival
ordered
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
set
out
with
the
lady
for
Coldstream
,
a
few
miles
up
the
Tweed
,
where
there
was
a
person
who
dealt
in
this
branch
of
commerce
,
and
they
were
noosed
,
before
the
Irishman
ever
dreamt
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
got
up
at
six
o'clock
,
and
found
the
bird
was
flown
,
he
made
such
a
noise
as
alarmed
the
whole
house
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
first
persons
he
encountered
,
was
the
postilion
returned
from
Coldstream
,
where
he
had
been
witness
to
the
marriage
,
and
over
and
above
an
handsome
gratuity
,
had
received
a
bride
's
favour
,
which
he
now
wore
in
his
cap
  
<EOS>
When
the
forsaken
lover
understood
they
were
actually
married
.
<EOS>
and
set
out
for
London
;
and
that
Dutton
had
discovered
to
the
lady
,
that
he
(
the
Hibernian
)
was
a
taylor
,
he
had
like
to
have
run
distracted
.
<EOS>
He
tore
the
riband
from
the
fellow
's
cap
,
and
beat
about
his
ears
.
<EOS>
He
swore
he
would
pursue
him
to
the
gates
of
hell
,
and
ordered
a
post
-
chaise
and
four
to
be
got
ready
as
soon
as
possible
;
but
,
recollecting
that
his
finances
would
not
admit
of
this
way
of
travelling
,
he
was
obliged
to
countermand
this
order
.
    
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
knew
nothing
at
all
of
what
had
happened
,
till
the
postilion
brought
me
the
keys
of
my
trunk
and
portmanteau
,
which
he
had
received
from
Dutton
,
who
sent
me
his
respects
,
hoping
I
would
excuse
him
for
his
abrupt
departure
,
as
it
was
a
step
upon
which
his
fortune
depended
  
Before
I
had
time
to
make
my
uncle
acquainted
with
this
event
,
the
Irishman
burst
into
my
chamber
,
without
any
introduction
,
exclaiming
,
  
"
<EOS>
But
my
soul
,
your
sarvant
has
robbed
me
of
five
thousand
pounds
,
and
I
'll
have
satisfaction
,
if
I
should
be
hanged
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
asked
him
who
he
was
,
"
My
name
(
said
he
)
is
Master
Macloughlin
 
<EOS>
but
it
should
be
Leighlin
Oneale
,
<EOS>
for
I
am
come
from
Ter
-
Owen
the
Great
;
and
so
I
am
as
good
a
gentleman
as
any
in
Ireland
;
and
that
rouge
,
your
sarvant
,
said
I
was
a
taylor
,
which
was
as
big
a
lie
as
if
he
had
called
me
the
pope
  
<EOS>
I
'm
a
man
of
fortune
,
and
have
spent
all
I
had
;
and
so
being
in
distress
,
Mr
Coshgrave
,
the
fashioner
in
Shuffolk
-
street
,
tuck
me
out
,
and
made
me
his
own
private
secretary
:
by
the
same
token
,
I
was
the
last
he
bailed
;
for
his
freinds
obliged
him
to
tie
himself
up
,
that
he
would
bail
no
more
above
ten
pounds
;
for
why
,
because
as
how
,
he
could
not
refuse
any
body
that
asked
,
and
therefore
in
time
would
have
robbed
himself
of
his
whole
fortune
,
and
,
if
he
had
lived
long
at
that
rate
,
must
have
died
bankrupt
very
soon
 
<EOS>
and
so
I
made
my
addresses
to
Miss
Skinner
,
a
young
lady
of
five
thousand
pounds
fortune
,
who
agreed
to
take
me
for
better
nor
worse
;
and
,
to
be
sure
,
this
day
would
have
put
me
in
possession
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
that
rogue
,
your
sarvant
,
who
came
like
a
tief
,
and
stole
away
my
property
,
and
made
her
believe
I
was
a
taylor
;
and
that
she
was
going
to
marry
the
ninth
part
of
a
man
:
<EOS>
but
the
devil
burn
my
soul
,
if
ever
I
catch
him
on
the
mountains
of
Tulloghobegly
,
if
I
do
n't
shew
him
that
I
'm
nine
times
as
good
<EOS>
a
man
as
he
,
or
e'er
a
bug
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
When
he
had
rung
out
his
first
alarm
,
I
told
him
I
was
sorry
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
so
jockied
;
but
it
was
no
business
of
mine
;
and
that
the
fellow
who
robbed
him
of
his
bride
,
had
likewise
robbed
me
of
my
servant
  
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
I
tell
you
then
,
(
cried
he
,
)
<EOS>
that
rogue
was
his
true
Christian
name
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
I
had
but
one
fair
trust
with
him
upon
the
sod
,
I
'd
give
him
lave
to
brag
all
the
rest
of
his
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
hearing
the
noise
,
came
in
,
and
being
informed
of
this
adventure
,
began
to
comfort
Mr
Oneale
for
the
lady
's
elopement
;
observing
that
he
seemed
to
have
had
a
lucky
escape
,
that
it
was
better
she
should
elope
before
,
than
after
marriage
  
<EOS>
The
Hibernian
was
of
a
very
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
If
he
had
been
once
married
,
she
might
have
eloped
as
soon
as
she
pleased
;
he
would
have
taken
care
that
she
should
not
have
carried
her
fortune
along
with
her
  
<EOS>
Ah
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
she
's
a
Judas
Iscariot
,
and
has
betrayed
me
with
a
kiss
;
and
,
like
Judas
,
she
carried
the
bag
,
and
has
not
left
me
money
enough
to
bear
my
expences
back
to
London
;
and
so
as
I
'm
come
to
this
pass
,
and
the
rogue
that
was
the
occasion
of
it
has
left
you
without
a
sarvant
,
you
may
put
me
in
his
place
;
and
by
Jasus
,
it
is
the
best
thing
you
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
begged
to
be
excused
,
declaring
I
could
put
up
with
any
inconvenience
,
rather
than
treat
as
a
footman
the
descendant
of
Tir
owen
the
Great
.
<EOS>
I
advised
him
to
return
to
his
friend
,
Mr
Cosgrave
,
and
take
his
passage
from
Newcastle
by
sea
,
towards
which
I
made
him
a
small
present
,
and
he
retired
,
seemingly
resigned
to
his
evil
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
upon
trial
a
Scotchman
,
called
Archy
M'Alpin
,
an
old
soldier
,
whose
last
master
,
a
colonel
,
lately
died
at
Berwick
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
is
old
and
withered
;
but
he
has
been
recommended
to
me
for
his
fidelity
,
by
Mrs
Humphreys
,
a
very
good
sort
of
a
woman
who
keeps
the
inn
at
Tweedmouth
,
and
is
much
respected
by
all
the
travellers
on
this
road
.
    
<EOS>
Clinker
,
without
doubt
,
thinks
himself
happy
in
the
removal
of
a
dangerous
rival
,
and
he
is
too
good
a
christian
,
to
repine
at
Dutton
's
success
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs
Jenkins
will
have
reason
to
congratulate
herself
upon
this
event
,
when
she
coolly
reflects
upon
the
matter
;
for
,
howsoever
she
was
forced
from
her
poise
for
a
season
,
by
snares
laid
for
her
vanity
,
Humphry
is
certainly
the
north
-
star
to
which
the
needle
of
her
affection
would
have
pointed
at
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
At
present
,
the
same
vanity
is
exceedingly
mortified
,
upon
finding
herself
abandoned
by
her
new
admirer
,
in
favour
of
another
inamorata
.
<EOS>
She
received
the
news
with
a
violent
burst
of
laughter
which
soon
brought
on
a
fit
of
crying
;
and
this
gave
the
finishing
blow
to
the
patience
of
her
mistress
,
which
had
held
out
beyond
all
expectation
.
<EOS>
She
now
opened
all
those
flood
-
gates
of
reprehension
,
which
had
been
shut
so
long
.
<EOS>
She
not
only
reproached
her
with
her
levity
and
indiscretion
,
but
attacked
her
on
the
score
of
religion
,
declaring
roundly
that
she
was
in
a
state
of
apostacy
and
reprobation
;
and
finally
,
threatened
to
send
her
a
-
packing
at
this
extremity
of
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
All
the
family
interceded
for
poor
Winifrid
,
not
even
excepting
her
slighted
swain
,
Mr
Clinker
,
who
,
on
his
knees
,
implored
and
obtained
her
pardon
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
,
however
,
another
consideration
that
gave
Mrs
Tabitha
some
disturbance
.
<EOS>
At
Newcastle
,
the
servants
had
been
informed
by
some
wag
,
that
there
was
nothing
to
eat
in
Scotland
,
but
oat
meal
and
sheep
's
heads
;
and
Lieutenant
Lismahago
being
consulted
,
what
he
said
served
rather
to
confirm
than
to
refute
the
report
.
<EOS>
Our
aunt
being
apprised
of
this
circumstance
,
very
gravely
advised
her
brother
to
provide
a
sumpter
horse
with
store
of
hams
,
tongues
,
bread
,
biscuit
,
and
other
articles
for
our
subsistence
,
in
the
course
of
our
peregrination
,
and
Mr
Bramble
,
as
gravely
replied
,
that
he
would
take
the
hint
into
consideration
:
but
,
finding
no
such
provision
was
made
,
she
now
revived
the
proposal
,
observing
that
there
was
a
tolerable
market
at
Berwick
,
where
we
might
be
supplied
;
and
that
my
man
's
horse
would
serve
as
a
beast
of
burden
  
<EOS>
The
"
squire
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
,
eyed
her
askance
with
a
look
of
ineffable
contempt
;
and
after
some
pause
,
"
Sister
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
persuade
myself
you
are
serious
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
so
little
acquainted
with
the
geography
of
the
island
,
that
she
imagined
we
could
not
go
to
Scotland
but
by
sea
;
and
,
after
we
had
passed
through
the
town
of
Berwick
,
when
he
told
her
we
were
upon
Scottish
ground
,
she
could
hardly
believe
the
assertion
  
<EOS>
If
the
truth
must
be
told
,
the
South
Britons
in
general
are
woefully
ignorant
in
this
particular
.
<EOS>
What
,
between
want
of
curiosity
,
and
traditional
sarcasms
,
the
effect
of
ancient
animosity
,
the
people
at
the
other
end
of
the
island
know
as
little
of
Scotland
as
of
Japan
.
    
<EOS>
If
I
had
never
been
in
Wales
,
I
should
have
been
more
struck
with
the
manifest
difference
in
appearance
betwix
the
peasants
and
commonalty
on
different
sides
of
the
Tweed
.
<EOS>
The
boors
of
Northumberland
are
lusty
fellows
,
fresh
complexioned
,
cleanly
,
and
well
cloathed
;
but
the
labourers
in
Scotland
are
generally
lank
,
lean
,
hard
-
featured
,
sallow
,
soiled
,
and
shabby
,
and
their
little
pinched
blue
caps
have
a
beggarly
effect
.
<EOS>
The
cattle
are
much
in
the
same
stile
with
their
drivers
,
meagre
,
stunted
,
and
ill
equipt
.
<EOS>
When
I
talked
to
my
uncle
on
this
subject
,
he
said
,
"
Though
all
the
Scottish
hinds
would
not
bear
to
be
compared
with
those
of
the
rich
counties
of
South
Britain
,
they
would
stand
very
well
in
competition
with
the
peasants
of
France
,
Italy
,
and
Savoy
 
not
to
mention
the
mountaineers
of
Wales
,
and
the
red
-
shanks
of
Ireland
.
"
    
<EOS>
We
entered
Scotland
by
a
frightful
moor
of
sixteen
miles
,
which
promises
very
little
for
the
interior
parts
of
the
kingdom
;
but
the
prospect
mended
as
we
advanced
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
Dunbar
,
which
is
a
neat
little
town
,
situated
on
the
sea
-
side
,
we
lay
at
a
country
inn
,
where
our
entertainment
far
exceeded
our
expectation
;
but
for
this
we
can
not
give
the
Scot
credit
,
as
the
landlord
is
a
native
of
England
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
we
dined
at
Haddington
,
which
has
been
a
place
of
some
consideration
,
but
is
now
gone
to
decay
;
and
in
the
evening
arrived
at
this
metropolis
,
of
which
I
can
say
very
little
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
romantic
,
from
its
situation
on
the
declivity
of
a
hill
,
having
a
fortified
castle
at
the
top
,
and
a
royal
palace
at
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
that
strikes
the
nose
of
a
stranger
,
shall
be
nameless
;
but
what
first
strikes
the
eye
,
is
the
unconscionable
height
of
the
houses
,
which
generally
rise
to
five
,
six
,
seven
,
and
eight
stories
,
and
,
in
some
places
,
(
as
I
am
assured
)
to
twelve
.
<EOS>
This
manner
of
building
,
attended
with
numberless
inconveniences
,
must
have
been
originally
owing
to
want
of
room
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
the
town
seems
to
be
full
of
people
:
but
their
looks
,
their
language
,
and
their
customs
,
are
so
different
from
ours
,
that
I
can
hardly
believe
myself
in
Great
-
Britain
.
    
<EOS>
The
inn
at
which
we
put
up
,
(
if
it
may
be
so
called
)
was
so
filthy
and
disagreeable
in
all
respects
.
<EOS>
that
my
uncle
began
to
fret
,
and
his
gouty
symptom
,
to
recur
  
Recollecting
,
however
,
that
he
had
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
one
Mr
Mitchelson
,
a
lawyer
,
he
sent
it
by
his
servant
,
with
a
compliment
,
importing
that
he
would
wait
upon
him
next
day
in
person
;
but
that
gentleman
visited
us
immediately
,
and
insisted
upon
our
going
to
his
own
house
,
until
he
could
provide
lodgings
for
our
accommodation
.
<EOS>
We
gladly
accepted
of
his
invitation
,
and
repaired
to
his
house
,
where
we
were
treated
with
equal
elegance
and
hospitality
,
to
the
utter
confusion
of
our
aunt
,
whose
prejudices
,
though
beginning
to
give
way
,
were
not
yet
entirely
removed
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
by
the
assistance
of
our
friend
,
we
are
settled
in
convenient
lodgings
,
up
four
pair
of
stairs
,
in
the
High
-
stret
,
the
fourth
story
being
,
in
this
city
,
reckoned
more
genteel
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
The
air
is
,
in
all
probability
,
the
better
;
but
it
requires
good
lungs
to
breathe
it
at
this
distance
above
the
surface
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
do
remain
above
it
,
whether
higher
or
lower
;
provided
I
breathe
at
all
,
    
I
shall
ever
be

Phillips

To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
,
THAT
part
of
Scotland
contiguous
to
Berwick
nature
seems
to
have
intended
as
a
barrier
between
two
hostile
nations
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
brown
desert
of
considerable
extent
,
that
produces
nothing
but
heath
and
fern
;
and
what
rendered
it
the
more
dreary
when
we
passed
,
there
was
a
thick
fog
that
hindered
us
from
seeing
above
twenty
yards
from
the
carriage
  
<EOS>
My
sister
began
to
make
wry
faces
,
and
use
her
smelling
-
bottle
;
Liddy
looked
blank
,
and
Mrs
Jenkins
dejected
;
but
in
a
few
hours
these
clouds
were
dissipated
;
the
sea
appeared
upon
our
right
and
on
the
left
the
mountains
retired
a
little
,
leaving
an
agreeable
plain
betwixt
them
and
the
beach
;
but
,
what
surprised
us
all
,
this
plain
,
to
the
extent
of
several
miles
,
was
covered
with
as
fine
wheat
as
ever
<EOS>
I
saw
in
the
most
fertile
parts
of
South
Britain
  
<EOS>
This
plentiful
crop
is
raised
in
the
open
field
,
without
any
inclosure
,
or
other
manure
than
the
alga
marina
,
or
sea
-
weed
,
which
abounds
on
this
coast
;
a
circumstance
which
shews
that
the
soil
and
climate
are
favourable
;
but
that
agriculture
in
this
country
is
not
yet
brought
to
tha
perfection
which
it
has
attained
in
England
.
<EOS>
Inclosures
would
not
only
keep
the
grounds
warm
,
and
the
several
fields
distinct
,
but
would
also
protect
the
crop
from
the
high
winds
,
which
are
so
frequent
in
this
part
of
the
island
.

Dunbar
is
well
situated
for
trade
,
and
has
a
curious
bason
,
where
ships
of
small
burden
may
be
perfectly
secure
;
but
there
is
little
appearance
of
business
in
the
place
  
<EOS>
From
thence
,
all
the
way
to
Edinburgh
,
there
is
a
continual
succession
of
fine
seats
,
belonging
to
noblemen
and
gentlemen
;
and
as
each
is
surrounded
by
its
own
parks
and
plantation
,
they
produce
a
very
pleasing
effect
in
a
country
which
lies
otherwise
open
and
exposed
.
<EOS>
At
Dunbar
there
is
a
noble
park
,
with
a
lodge
,
belonging
to
the
Duke
of
Roxburg
,
where
Oliver
Cromwell
had
his
head
-
quarters
,
when
Lesley
,
at
the
head
of
a
Scotch
army
,
took
possession
of
the
mountains
in
the
neighoourhood
,
and
hampered
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
embark
and
get
away
by
sea
,
had
not
the
fanaticism
of
the
enemy
forfeited
the
advantage
which
they
had
obtained
by
their
general
's
conduct
  
Their
ministers
,
by
exhortation
,
prayer
,
assurance
,
and
prophecy
,
instigated
them
to
go
down
and
slay
the
Philistines
in
Gilgal
,
and
they
quitted
their
ground
accordingly
,
notwithstanding
all
that
Lesley
could
do
to
restrain
the
madness
of
their
enthusiasm
  
<EOS>
When
Oliver
saw
them
in
motion
,
he
exclaimed
,
"
Praised
be
the
Lord
,
he
hath
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
his
servant
!
"
and
ordered
his
troops
to
sing
a
psalm
of
thanksgiving
,
while
they
advanced
in
order
to
the
plain
,
where
the
Scots
were
routed
with
great
slaughter
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
neighbourhood
of
Haddington
,
there
is
a
gentleman
's
house
,
in
the
building
of
which
,
and
the
improvements
about
,
it
,
he
is
said
to
have
expended
forty
thousand
pounds
:
<EOS>
but
I
can
not
say
I
was
much
pleased
with
either
the
architecture
or
the
situation
;
though
it
has
in
front
a
pastoral
stream
,
the
banks
of
which
are
laid
out
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
.
<EOS>
I
intended
to
pay
my
respects
to
lord
Elibank
,
whom
I
had
the
honour
to
know
at
London
many
years
ago
.
<EOS>
He
lives
in
this
part
of
Lothian
;
but
was
gone
to
the
North
,
on
a
visit
  
<EOS>
You
have
often
heard
me
mention
this
nobleman
,
whom
I
have
long
revered
for
his
humanity
and
universal
intelligence
,
over
and
above
the
entertainment
arising
from
the
originality
of
his
character
  
At
Musselburgh
,
however
,
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
drink
tea
with
my
old
friend
Mr
Cardonel
;
and
at
his
house
I
met
with
Dr
C
#
#
#
#
,
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
whose
humour
and
conversation
inflamed
me
with
a
desire
of
being
better
acquainted
with
his
person
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
that
these
Scots
make
their
way
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
.
    
<EOS>
This
place
is
but
four
miles
from
Edinburgh
,
towards
which
we
proceeded
along
the
sea
-
shore
,
upon
a
firm
bottom
of
smooth
sand
,
which
the
tide
had
left
uncovered
in
its
retreat
  
Edinburgh
,
from
this
avenue
,
is
not
seen
to
much
advantage
  
<EOS>
We
had
only
an
imperfect
view
of
the
castle
and
upper
parts
of
the
town
,
which
varied
incessantly
according
to
the
inflexions
of
the
road
,
and
exhibited
the
appearance
of
detatched
spires
and
turrets
,
belonging
to
some
magnificent
edifice
in
ruins
.
<EOS>
The
palace
of
Holyrood
-
house
stands
on
the
left
,
as
you
enter
the
Canongate
  
<EOS>
This
is
a
street
continued
from
hence
to
the
gate
called
Nether
Bow
,
which
is
now
taken
away
;
so
that
there
is
no
interruption
for
a
long
mile
,
from
the
bottom
to
the
top
of
the
hill
on
which
the
Castle
stands
in
a
most
imperial
situation
  
Considering
its
fine
pavement
,
its
width
,
and
the
lofty
houses
on
each
side
<EOS>
,
this
would
be
undoubtedly
one
of
the
noblest
streets
in
Europe
,
if
an
ugly
mass
of
mean
buildings
,
called
the
Lucken
-
Booths
,
had
not
thrust
itself
,
by
what
accident
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
into
the
middle
of
the
way
,
like
Middle
-
Row
in
Holborn
.
<EOS>
The
city
stands
upon
two
hills
,
and
the
bottom
between
them
;
and
,
with
all
its
defects
,
may
very
well
pass
for
the
capital
of
a
moderate
kingdom
  
<EOS>
It
is
full
of
people
,
and
continually
resounds
with
the
noise
of
coaches
and
other
carriages
,
for
luxury
as
well
as
commerce
.
<EOS>
As
far
as
I
can
perceive
,
her
is
no
want
of
provisions
  
<EOS>
The
beef
and
mutton
are
as
delicate
here
as
in
Wales
;
the
sea
affords
plenty
of
good
fish
;
the
bread
is
remarkably
fine
;
and
the
water
is
excellent
,
though
I
'm
afraid
not
in
sufficient
quantity
to
answer
all
the
purposes
of
cleanliness
and
convenience
;
articles
in
which
,
it
must
be
allowed
,
our
fellow
-
subjects
are
a
little
defective
  
<EOS>
The
water
is
brought
in
leadden
pipes
from
a
mountain
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
a
cistern
on
the
Castle
-
hill
,
from
whence
it
is
distributed
to
public
conduits
in
different
part
of
the
city
  
From
these
it
is
carried
in
barrels
,
on
the
backs
of
male
and
female
porters
,
up
two
,
three
,
four
,
five
,
six
,
seven
,
and
eight
pair
of
stairs
,
for
the
use
of
particular
families
  
<EOS>
Every
story
is
a
complete
house
,
occupied
by
a
separate
family
;
and
the
stair
being
common
to
them
all
,
is
generally
left
in
a
very
filthy
condition
;
a
man
must
tread
with
great
circumspection
to
get
safe
housed
with
unpolluted
shoes
  
<EOS>
Nothing
can
form
a
stronger
contrast
,
than
the
difference
betwixt
the
outside
and
inside
of
the
door
;
for
the
good
women
of
this
metropolis
are
remarkably
nice
in
the
ornaments
and
propriety
of
their
apartments
,
as
if
they
were
resolved
to
transfer
the
imputation
from
the
individual
to
the
public
.
<EOS>
You
are
no
stranger
to
their
method
of
discharging
all
their
impurities
from
their
windows
,
at
a
certain
hour
of
the
night
,
as
the
custom
is
in
Spain
,
Portugal
,
and
some
parts
of
France
and
Italy
  
A
practice
to
which
I
can
by
no
means
be
reconciled
;
for
notwithstanding
all
the
care
that
is
taken
by
their
scavengers
to
remove
this
nuisance
every
morning
by
break
of
day
,
enough
still
remains
to
offend
the
eyes
,
as
well
as
other
organs
of
those
whom
use
has
not
hardened
against
all
delicacy
of
sensation
.
    
<EOS>
The
inhabitans
seem
insensible
to
these
impressions
,
and
are
apt
to
imagine
the
disgust
that
we
avow
is
little
better
than
affectation
;
but
they
ought
to
have
some
compassion
for
strangers
,
who
have
not
been
used
to
this
kind
of
sufferance
;
and
consider
,
whither
it
may
not
be
worth
while
to
take
some
pains
to
vindicate
themselves
from
the
reproach
that
,
on
this
account
,
they
bear
among
their
neighbours
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
surpising
height
of
their
houses
,
it
is
absurd
in
many
respects
;
but
in
one
particular
light
I
can
not
view
it
without
horror
;
that
is
,
the
dreadful
situation
of
all
the
families
above
,
in
case
the
common
stair
case
should
be
rendered
impassible
by
a
fire
in
the
lower
stories
  
<EOS>
In
order
to
prevent
the
shocking
consequences
that
must
attend
such
an
accident
,
it
would
be
a
right
measure
to
open
doors
of
communication
from
one
house
to
another
,
on
every
story
,
by
which
the
people
might
fly
from
such
a
terrible
visitation
.
<EOS>
In
all
parts
of
the
world
,
we
see
the
force
of
habit
prevailing
over
all
the
dictates
of
convenience
and
sagacity
  
<EOS>
All
the
people
of
business
at
Edinburgh
,
and
even
the
genteel
company
,
may
be
seen
standing
in
crowds
every
day
,
from
one
to
two
in
the
afternoon
,
in
the
open
street
,
at
a
place
where
formerly
stood
a
market
-
cross
,
which
(
by
the
bye
)
was
a
curious
piece
of
Gothick
architecture
,
still
to
be
seen
in
lord
Sommerville
's
garden
in
this
neighbourhood
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
the
people
stand
in
the
open
street
from
the
force
of
custom
,
rather
than
move
a
few
yards
to
an
Exchange
that
stands
empty
on
one
side
,
or
to
the
parliament
-
close
on
the
other
,
which
is
a
noble
square
,
adorned
with
a
fine
equestrian
statute
of
king
Charles
II
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
thus
assembled
,
are
entertained
with
a
variety
of
tunes
,
played
upon
a
set
of
bells
,
fixed
in
a
steeple
hard
by
  
As
these
bells
are
well
-
toned
,
and
the
musician
,
who
has
a
salary
from
the
city
,
for
playing
upon
them
with
keys
,
is
no
bad
performer
,
the
entertainment
is
really
agreeable
,
and
very
striking
to
the
ears
of
a
stranger
.
    
<EOS>
The
public
inns
of
Edinburgh
,
are
still
worse
than
those
of
London
;
but
by
means
of
a
worthy
gentleman
,
to
whom
I
was
recommended
,
we
have
got
decent
lodgings
in
the
house
of
a
widow
gentlewoman
,
of
the
name
of
Lockhart
;
and
here
I
shall
stay
until
I
have
seen
every
thing
that
is
remarkable
in
and
about
this
capital
.
<EOS>
I
now
begin
to
feel
the
good
effects
of
exercise
  
<EOS>
I
eat
like
a
farmer
,
sleep
from
mid
-
night
till
eight
in
the
morning
without
interruption
,
and
enjoy
a
constant
tide
of
spirits
,
equally
distant
from
inanition
and
excess
;
but
whatever
ebbs
or
flows
my
constitution
may
undergo
,
my
heart
will
still
declare
that
I
am

Dear

THE

squire
has
been
so
kind
as
to
rap
my
bit
of
nonsense
under
the
kiver
of
his
own
sheet
  
<EOS>
O

Mary

<EOS>
Mary
Jones

<EOS>
I
have
had
trials
and
trembulation
.
<EOS>
God
help
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
vixen
:
and
a
griffin
these
many
days
  
<EOS>
Sattin
has
had
power
to
tempt
me
in
the
shape
of
van
Ditton
,
the
young
"
squire
's
wally
de
shamble
;
but
by
God
's
grease
he
did
not
purvail
  
<EOS>
I
thoft
as
how
,
there
was
no
arm
in
going
to
play
at
Newcastle
,
with
my
hair
dressed
in
the
Parish
Fashion
;
and
as
for
the
trifle
of
paint
,
he
said
as
how
my
complexion
wanted
rouch
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
let
him
put
it
on
with
a
little
Spanish
owl
;
but
a
mischievous
mob
of
colliers
,
and
such
promiscous
ribble
rabble
,
that
could
bare
no
smut
but
their
own
,
attacked
us
in
the
street
,
and
called
me
hoar
and
painted
Issabel
,
and
splashed
my
close
,
and
spoiled
me
a
complete
set
of
blond
lace
triple
ruffles
,
not
a
pin
the
worse
for
the
ware
  
<EOS>
They
cost
me
seven
good
sillings
,
to
lady
Griskin
's
woman
at
London
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
axed
Mr
Clinker
what
they
meant
by
calling
me
Issabel
,
he
put
the
byebill
into
my
hand
,
and
I
read
of
van
Issabel
a
painted
harlot
,
that
was
thrown
out
of
a
vindore
,
and
the
dogs
came
and
licked
her
blood
  
<EOS>
But
I
am
no
harlot
;
and
,
with
God
's
blessing
,
no
dog
shall
have
my
poor
blood
to
lick
:
marry
,
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
,
amen
!
<EOS>
As
for
Ditton
,
after
all
his
courting
,
and
his
compliment
,
he
stole
away
an
Irishman
's
bride
,
and
took
a
French
leave
of
me
and
his
master
;
but
I
vally
not
his
going
a
farting
;
but
I
have
had
hanger
on
his
account
  
<EOS>
Mistress
scoulded
like
mad
;
thof
I
have
the
comfit
that
all
the
family
took
my
part
,
and
even
Mr
Clinker
pleaded
for
me
on
his
bended
knee
;
thof
,
God
<EOS>
he
knows
,
he
had
raisins
enuff
to
complain
;
but
he
's
a
good
sole
,
abounding
with
Christian
meekness
,
and
one
day
will
meet
with
his
reward
.
    
<EOS>
And
now
,
dear
Mary
,
we
have
got
to
Haddingborrough
,
among
the
Scots
,
who
are
civil
enuff
for
our
money
,
thof
<EOS>
I
do
n't
speak
their
lingo
  
<EOS>
But
they
should
not
go
for
to
impose
upon
foreigners
;
for
the
bills
in
their
houses
say
,
they
have
different
easements
to
let
;
and
behold
there
is
nurro
geaks
in
the
whole
kingdom
,
nor
any
thing
for
poor
servants
,
but
a
barrel
with
a
pair
of
tongs
thrown
a
cross
;
and
all
the
chairs
in
the
family
are
emptied
into
this
here
barrel
once
aday
;
and
at
ten
o'clock
at
night
the
whole
cargo
is
flung
out
of
a
back
vindore
that
looks
into
some
street
or
lane
,
and
the
maid
calls
gardy
loo
to
the
passengers
,
which
signifies
Lord
have
mercy
upon
you
!
<EOS>
and
this
is
done
every
night
in
every
house
in
Haddingborrough
;
so
you
may
guess
,
Mary
Jones
,
what
a
sweet
savour
comes
from
such
a
number
of
profuming
pans
;
but
they
say
it
is
wholesome
,
and
,
truly
,
I
believe
it
is
;
for
being
in
the
vapours
,
and
thinking
of
Issabel
and
Mr
Clinker
,
I
was
going
into
a
fit
of
astericks
,
<EOS>
when
this
fiff
,
saving
your
presence
,
took
me
by
the
nose
so
powerfully
that
I
sneezed
three
times
,
and
found
myself
wonderfully
refreshed
;
and
this
to
be
sure
is
the
raisin
why
there
are
no
fits
in
Haddingborrough
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
likewise
made
believe
,
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
oat
-
meal
and
seeps
-
heads
;
but
if
I
had
n't
been
a
fool
,
I
mought
have
known
there
could
be
no
heads
without
kerkasses
  
<EOS>
This
very
blessed
day
I
dined
upon
a
delicate
leg
of
Velsh
mutton
and
cully
-

I
leave

pore

Mr
Clinker
tells
me
here
is
a
great
call
of
the
gospel

but
I
wish
some
of
our
family
be
not
fallen
off
from
the
rite
way
  
<EOS>
O
,
if
I
was
given
to
tail
-
baring
,
I
have
my
own
secrets
to
discover
  
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
deal
of
huggling
and
flurtation
betwixt
mistress
and
an
ould
Scots
officer
,
called
Kismycago
.
<EOS>
He
looks
for
all
the
orld
like
the
scare
-
crow
that
our
gardener
set
up
to
frite
away
the
sparrows

and
what
will
come
of
it

the
Lord

come
what
will

it

never

I
menchioned
a

the

Remember
me
kindly

they
got
the

<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
IF
I
stay
much
longer
at
Edinburgh
,
I
shall
be
changed
into
a
downright
Caledonian
  
My
uncle
observes
,
that
I
have
alredy
acquired
something
of
the
country
accent
.
<EOS>
The
people
here
are
so
social
and
attentive
in
their
civilities
to
strangers
,
that
I
am
insensibly
sucked
into
the
channel
of
their
manners
and
customs
,
although
they
are
in
fact
much
more
different
from
ours
than
you
can
imagine
  
<EOS>
That
difference
,
however
,
which
struck
me
very
much
at
my
first
arrival
,
I
now
hardly
perceive
,
and
my
ear
is
perfectly
reconciled
to
the
Scotch
accent
,
which
I
find
even
agreeable
in
the
mouth
of
a
pretty
woman
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
sort
of
Doric
dialect
,
which
gives
an
idea
of
amiable
simplicity
  
<EOS>
You
can
not
imagine
how
we
have
been
caressed
and
feasted
in
the
good
town
of
Edinburgh
,
of
which
we
are
become
free
denizens
and
guild
brothers
,
by
the
special
favour
of
the
magistracy
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
a
whimsical
commission
from
Bath
,
to
a
citizen
of
this
metropolis
  
Quin
understanding
our
intention
to
visit
Edinburgh
,
pulled
out
a
guinea
,
and
desired
the
favour
I
would
drink
it
at
a
tavern
,
with
a
particular
friend
and
bottle
-
companion
of
his
,
one
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
C
#
#
#
#
,
a
lawyer
of
this
city
  
<EOS>
I
charged
myself
with
the
commission
,
and
,
taking
the
guinea
,
"
You
see
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
I
have
pocketed
your
bounty
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
(
replied
Quin
,
laughing
)
;
and
a
head
-
ake
into
the
bargain
,
if
you
drink
fair
,
"
I
made
use
of
this
introduction
to
Mr
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
received
me
with
open
arms
,
and
gave
me
the
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
according
to
the
cartel
.
<EOS>
He
had
provided
a
company
of
jolly
fellows
,
among
whom
I
found
myself
extremely
happy
;
and
did
Mr
C
#
#
#
#
and
Quin
all
the
justice
in
my
power
;
<EOS>
but
,
alas
,
I
was
no
more
than
a
tiro
among
a
troop
of
veterans
,
who
had
compassion
upon
my
youth
,
and
conveyed
me
home
in
the
morning
,
by
what
means
I
know
not
  
<EOS>
Quin
was
mistaken
,
however
,
as
to
the
head
-
ake
;
the
claret
was
too
good
to
treat
me
so
roughly
.
    
<EOS>
While
Mr
Bramble
holds
conferences
with
the
graver
literati
of
the
place
,
and
our
females
are
entertained
at
visits
by
the
Scotch
ladies
,
who
are
the
best
and
kindest
creatures
upon
earth
,
I
pass
my
time
among
the
bucks
of
Edinburgh
;
who
,
with
a
great
share
of
spirit
and
vivacity
,
have
a
certain
shrewdness
and
self
-
command
that
is
not
often
found
among
their
neighbours
,
in
the
high
-
day
of
youth
and
exultation
  
Not
a
hint
escapes
a
Scotchman
that
can
be
be
interpreted
into
offence
by
any
individual
in
the
company
;
and
national
reflections
are
never
heard
  
<EOS>
In
this
particular
,
I
must
own
,
we
are
both
unjust
and
ungrateful
to
the
Scots
;
<EOS>
for
,
as
far
as
I
am
able
to
judge
,
the
have
a
real
esteem
for
,
the
natives
of
South
-
Britain
:
and
never
mention
our
country
,
but
with
expressions
of
regard
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
they
are
far
from
being
servile
imitators
of
our
modes
and
fashionable
vices
.
<EOS>
All
their
customs
and
regulations
of
public
and
private
oeconomy
,
of
business
and
diversion
,
are
in
their
own
stile
.
<EOS>
This
remarkably
predominates
in
their
looks
,
their
dress
,
and
manner
,
their
music
,
and
even
their
cookery
.
<EOS>
Our
"
squire
declares
,
that
he
knows
not
another
people
upon
earth
,
so
strongly
marked
with
a
national
character
  
<EOS>
Now
we
are
upon
the
article
of
cookery
,
I
must
own
,
some
of
their
dishes
are
savoury
,
and
even
delicate
;
but
I
am
not
yet
Scotchman
enough
to
relish
their
singed
sheep's
-
head
and
haggice
,
which
were
provided
at
our
request
,
one
day
at
Mr
Mitchelson
's
,
where
we
dined
  
The
first
put
me
in
mind
of
the
history
of
Congo
,
in
which
I
had
read
of
negro
's
heads
sold
publickly
in
the
markets
;
the
last
,
being
a
mess
of
minced
lights
,
livers
,
suet
,
oat
-
meal
,
onions
,
and
pepper
,
inclosed
in
a
sheep
's
stomach
,
had
a
very
sudden
effect
upon
mine
,
and
the
delicate
Mrs
Tabby
changed
colour
;
when
the
cause
of
our
disgust
was
instantaneously
removed
at
the
nod
of
our
entertainer
.
<EOS>
The
Scots
in
general
,
are
attached
to
this
composition
,
with
a
sort
of
national
fondness
,
as
well
as
to
their
oat
-
meal
bread
;
which
is
presented
at
every
table
,
in
thin
triangular
cakes
,
baked
upon
a
plate
of
iron
,
called
a
gridle
;
and
these
,
many
of
the
natives
,
even
in
the
higher
ranks
of
like
,
prefer
to
wheaten
-
bread
,
which
they
have
here
in
perfection
  
<EOS>
You
know
we
used
to
vex
poor
Murray
of
Baliol
-
college
,
by
asking
,
if
there
was
really
no
fruit
but
turnips
in
Scotland
?
  
<EOS>
Sure
enough
,
I
have
seen
turnips
make
their
appearance
,
not
as
a
desert
,
but
by
way
of
hors
d
'
oeuvres
,
or
whets
,
as
radishes
are
served
up
betwixt
more
substantial
dishes
in
France
and
Italy
;
but
it
must
be
observed
,
that
the
turnips
of
this
country
are
as
much
superior
in
sweetness
,
delicacy
,
and
flavour
,
to
those
of
England
,
as
a
musk
-
melon
is
to
the
stock
of
a
common
cabbage
.
<EOS>
They
are
small
and
conical
,
of
a
yellowish
colour
,
with
a
very
thin
skin
;
and
,
over
and
above
their
agreeable
taste
,
are
valuable
for
their
antiscorbutic
quality
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
fruit
now
in
season
,
such
as
cherries
,
gooseberries
,
and
currants
,
there
is
no
want
of
them
at
Edinburgh
;
and
in
the
gardens
of
some
gentlemen
,
who
live
in
this
neighbourhood
,
there
is
now
a
very
favourable
appearance
of
apricots
,
peaches
,
nectarines
,
and
even
grapes
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
have
seen
a
very
fine
shew
of
pine
-
apples
within
a
few
miles
of
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
we
have
no
reason
to
be
surprised
at
these
particulars
,
when
we
consider
how
little
difference
there
is
,
in
fact
,
betwixt
<EOS>
this
climate
and
that
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
All
the
remarkable
places
in
the
city
and
its
avenues
,
for
ten
miles
around
,
we
have
visited
,
much
to
our
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
In
the
Castle
are
some
royal
apartments
,
where
the
sovereign
occasionally
resided
;
and
here
are
carefully
preserved
the
regalia
of
the
kingdom
,
consisting
of
a
crown
,
<EOS>
said
to
be
of
great
value
,
a
sceptre
,
and
a
sword
of
state
,
adorned
with
jewels
  
Of
these
symbols
of
sovereignty
,
the
people
are
exceedingly
jealous
  
<EOS>
A
report
being
spread
,
during
the
sitting
of
the
union
-
parliament
,
that
they
were
removed
to
London
,
such
a
tumult
arose
,
that
the
lord
commissioner
would
have
been
torn
in
pieces
,
if
he
had
not
produced
them
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
populace
.
    
<EOS>
The
palace
of
Holyrood
-
house
is
an
elegant
piece
of
architecture
,
but
sunk
in
an
obscure
,
and
as
I
take
it
,
unwholesome
bottom
,
where
one
would
imagine
it
had
been
placed
on
purpose
to
be
concealed
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
are
lofty
,
but
unfurnished
;
and
as
for
the
pictures
of
the
Scottish
kings
,
from
Fergus
I
,
to
king
William
,
they
are
paultry
daubings
,
mostly
by
the
same
hand
,
painted
either
from
the
imagination
,
or
porters
hired
to
sit
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
All
the
diversions
of
London
we
enjoyed
at
Edinburgh
,
in
a
small
compass
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
well
-
conducted
concert
,
in
which
several
gentlemen
performed
on
different
instruments
  
<EOS>
The
Scots
are
all
musicians
  
<EOS>
Every
man
you
meet
plays
on
the
flute
,
the
violin
,
or
violoncello
;
and
there
is
one
nobleman
,
whose
compositions
are
universally
admired
  
Our
company
of
actors
is
very
tolerable
;
and
a
subscription
is
now
on
foot
for
building
a
new
theatre
;
but
their
assemblies
please
me
above
all
other
publick
exhibitions
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
been
at
the
hunters
ball
,
where
I
was
really
astonished
to
see
such
a
number
of
fine
women
  
<EOS>
The
English
,
who
have
never
crossed
the
Tweed
,
imagine
erroneously
,
that
the
Scotch
ladies
are
not
remarkable
for
personal
attractions
;
but
,
I
can
declare
with
a
safe
conscience
,
I
never
saw
so
many
handsome
females
together
,
as
were
assembled
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
At
the
Leith
races
,
the
best
company
comes
hither
from
the
remoter
provinces
;
so
that
,
I
suppose
,
we
had
all
the
beauty
of
the
kingdom
concentrated
as
it
were
into
one
focus
;
which
was
,
indeed
,
so
vehement
,
that
my
heart
could
hardly
resist
its
power
  
Between
friends
,
it
has
sustained
some
damage
from
the
bright
eyes
of
the
charming
miss
R####n
,
whom
I
had
the
honour
to
dance
with
at
the
ball
  
<EOS>
The
countess
of
Melvile
attracted
all
eyes
,
and
the
admiration
of
all
present
  
<EOS>
She
was
accompanied
by
the
agreeable
miss
Grieve
,
who
made
many
conquests
;
nor
did
my
sister
Liddy
pass
unnoticed
in
the
assembly
  
<EOS>
She
is
become
a
toast
at
Edinburgh
,
by
the
name
of
the
Fair
Cambrian
,
and
has
already
been
the
occasion
of
much
wine
-
shed
;
but
the
poor
girl
met
with
an
accident
at
the
ball
,
which
has
given
us
great
disturbance
.
    
<EOS>
A
young
gentleman
,
the
express
image
of
that
rascal
Wilson
,
went
up
to
ask
her
to
dance
a
minuet
;
and
his
sudden
appearance
shocked
her
so
much
,
that
she
fainted
away
  
<EOS>
I
call
Wilson
a
rascal
,
because
,
if
he
had
been
really
a
gentleman
,
with
honourable
intentions
,
he
would
have
,
ere
now
,
appeared
in
his
own
character
  
<EOS>
I
must
own
,
my
blood
boil
's
with
indignation
when
I
think
of
that
fellow
's
presumption
;
and
Heaven
confound
me
if
I
do
n't
  
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
be
so
womanish
as
to
rail
  
<EOS>
Time
will
,
perhaps
,
furnish
occasion
  
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
<EOS>
the
cause
of
Liddy
's
disorder
remains
a
secret
.
<EOS>
The
lady
directress
of
the
ball
,
thinking
she
was
overcome
by
the
heat
of
the
place
,
and
her
conveyed
to
another
room
,
where
she
soon
recovered
so
well
,
as
to
return
and
join
in
the
country
-
dances
,
in
which
the
Scotch
lasses
acquit
themselves
with
such
spirit
and
agility
,
as
put
their
partners
to
the
height
of
their
mettle
  
<EOS>
I
believe
our
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
,
had
entertained
hopes
of
being
able
to
do
some
execution
among
the
cavaliers
at
this
assembly
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
several
days
in
consultation
with
milliners
and
mantuamakers
,
preparing
for
the
occasion
,
at
which
she
made
her
appearance
in
a
full
suit
of
damask
,
so
thick
and
heavy
,
that
the
sight
of
it
alone
,
at
this
season
of
the
year
,
was
sufficient
to
draw
drops
of
sweat
from
any
man
of
ordinary
imagination
  
<EOS>
She
danced
one
minuet
with
our
friend
,
Mr
Mitchelson
,
who
favoured
her
so
far
,
in
the
spirit
of
hospitality
and
politeness
;
and
she
was
called
out
a
second
time
by
the
young
laird
of
Ballymawhawple
,
who
,
coming
in
by
accident
,
could
not
readily
find
any
other
partner
;
but
as
the
first
was
a
married
man
,
and
the
second
payed
no
particular
homage
to
her
charms
,
which
were
also
over
-
looked
by
the
rest
of
the
company
,
she
became
dissatisfied
and
censorious
  
<EOS>
At
supper
,
she
observed
that
the
Scotch
gentlemen
made
a
very
good
figure
,
when
they
were
a
little
improved
by
travelling
;
and
therefore
it
was
pity
they
did
not
all
take
the
benefit
of
going
abroad
  
<EOS>
She
said
the
women
were
aukward
,
masculine
creatures
;
that
,
in
dancing
,
they
lifted
their
legs
like
so
many
colts
;
that
they
had
no
idea
of
graceful
motion
,
and
put
on
their
clothes
in
a
frightful
manner
;
but
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
Tabby
herself
was
the
most
ridiculous
figure
,
and
the
worst
dressed
of
the
whole
assembly
  
<EOS>
The
neglect
of
the
male
sex
rendered
her
malcontent
and
peevish
;
she
now
found
fault
with
every
thing
at
Edinburgh
,
and
teized
her
brother
to
leave
the
place
,
when
she
was
suddenly
reconciled
to
it
on
a
religous
consideration
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
sect
of
fanaticks
,
who
have
separated
themselves
from
the
established
kirk
,
under
the
name
of
Seceders
  
<EOS>
They
acknowledge
no
earthly
head
of
the
church
,
reject
lay
-
patronage
,
and
maintain
the
methodist
doctrines
of
the
new
birth
,
the
new
light
,
the
efficacy
of
grace
,
the
insufficiency
of
works
,
and
the
operations
of
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
,
attended
by
Humpry
Clinker
,
was
introduced
to
one
of
their
conventicles
,
where
they
both
received
much
edification
;
and
she
has
had
the
good
fortune
to
come
acquainted
with
a
pious
Christian
,
called
Mr
Moffat
,
who
is
very
powerful
in
prayer
,
and
often
assists
her
in
private
exercises
of
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
I
never
saw
such
a
concourse
of
genteel
company
at
any
races
in
England
,
as
appeared
on
the
course
of
Leith
  
Hard
by
,
in
the
fields
called
the
Links
,
the
citizens
of
Edinburgh
divert
themselves
at
a
game
called
golf
,
in
which
they
use
a
curious
kind
of
bats
,
tipt
with
horn
,
and
small
elastic
balls
of
leather
,
stuffed
with
feathers
,
rather
less
than
tennis
balls
,
but
of
a
much
harder
consistence
  
This
they
strike
with
such
force
and
dexterity
from
one
hole
to
another
,
that
they
will
fly
to
an
incredible
distance
.
<EOS>
Of
this
diversion
the
Scots
are
so
fond
,
that
when
the
weather
will
permit
,
you
may
see
a
multitude
of
all
ranks
,
from
the
senator
of
justice
to
the
lowest
tradesmen
,
mingled
together
in
their
shirts
,
and
following
the
balls
with
the
utmost
eagerness
  
Among
others
,
I
was
shewn
one
particular
set
of
golfers
,
the
youngest
of
whom
was
turned
of
fourscore
  
<EOS>
They
were
all
gentlemen
of
independent
fortunes
,
who
had
amused
themselves
with
this
pastime
for
the
best
part
of
a
century
,
without
having
ever
felt
the
least
alarm
from
sickness
or
disgust
;
and
they
never
went
to
bed
,
without
having
each
the
best
part
of
a
gallon
of
claret
in
his
belly
.
<EOS>
Such
uninterrupted
exercise
,
cooperating
with
the
keen
air
from
the
sea
,
must
,
without
all
doubt
,
keep
the
appetite
always
on
edge
,
and
steel
the
constitution
against
all
the
common
attacks
of
distemper
.
    
<EOS>
The
Leith
races
gave
occasion
to
another
entertainment
of
a
very
singular
nature
  
<EOS>
There
is
at
Edinburgh
a
society
or
corporation
of
errand
-
boys
,
called
cawdies
,
who
ply
in
the
streets
at
night
with
paper
lanthorns
,
and
are
very
serviceable
in
carrying
messages
  
<EOS>
These
fellows
,
though
shabby
in
their
appearance
,
and
rudely
familiar
in
their
address
,
are
wonderfully
acute
,
and
so
noted
for
fidelity
,
that
there
is
no
instance
of
a
cawdy
's
having
betrayed
his
trust
  
<EOS>
Such
is
their
intelligence
,
that
they
know
,
not
only
every
individual
of
the
place
,
but
also
every
stranger
,
by
that
time
he
has
been
four
and
twenty
hours
in
Edinburgh
;
and
no
transaction
,
even
the
most
private
,
can
escape
their
notice
  
<EOS>
They
are
particularly
famous
for
their
dexterity
in
executing
one
of
the
functions
of
Mercury
;
though
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
never
employed
them
in
this
department
of
business
  
<EOS>
Had
I
occasion
for
any
service
of
this
nature
,
my
own
man
Archy
M'Alpine
,
is
as
well
qualified
as
e'er
<EOS>
a
cawdie
in
Edinburgh
;
and
I
am
much
mistaken
,
if
he
has
not
been
heretofore
of
their
fraternity
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
may
,
they
resolved
to
give
a
dinner
and
a
ball
at
Leith
,
to
which
they
formally
invited
all
the
young
noblemen
and
gentlemen
that
were
at
the
races
;
and
this
invitation
was
reinforced
by
an
assurance
that
all
the
celebrated
ladies
of
pleasure
would
grace
the
entertainment
with
their
company
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
a
card
on
this
occasion
,
and
went
thither
with
half
a
dozen
of
my
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
large
half
the
cloth
was
laid
on
a
long
range
of
tables
joined
together
,
and
here
the
company
seated
themselves
,
to
the
number
of
about
fourscore
,
lords
,
and
lairds
,
and
other
gentlemen
,
courtezans
and
cawdies
mingled
together
,
as
the
slaves
and
their
masters
were
in
the
time
of
the
Saturnalia
in
ancient
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
The
toastmaster
,
who
sat
at
the
upper
end
,
was
one
Cawdie
Fraser
,
a
veteran
pimp
,
distinguished
for
his
humour
and
sagacity
,
well
known
and
much
respected
in
his
profession
by
all
the
guests
,
male
and
female
,
that
were
here
assembled
  
<EOS>
He
had
bespoke
the
dinner
and
the
wine
he
had
taken
care
that
all
his
brethren
should
appear
in
decent
apparel
and
clean
linen
;
and
he
himself
wore
a
periwig
with
three
tails
,
in
honour
of
the
festival
.
  
<EOS>
I
assure
you
the
banquet
was
both
elegant
and
plentiful
,
and
seasoned
with
a
thousand
sallies
,
that
promoted
a
general
spirit
of
mirth
and
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
desert
,
Mr
Fraser
proposed
the
following
toasts
,
which
I
do
n't
pretend
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gibb
's
contract
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
beggar
's
bennison
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
King
and
kirk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Great
-
Britain
and
Ireland
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
filling
a
bumper
,
and
turning
to
me
,
"
Mester
Malford
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
may
a
'
unkindness
cease
betwixt
John
Bull
and
his
sister
Moggy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
next
person
he
singled
out
,
was
a
nobleman
who
had
been
long
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ma
lord
,
(
cried
Fraser
)
<EOS>
here
is
a
bumper
to
a
'
those
noblemen
who
have
virtue
enough
to
spend
their
rents
in
their
ain
countray
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
afterwards
addressed
himself
to
a
member
of
parliament
in
these
words
:
  
"
Mester
 
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
ye'll
ha
'
nae
objection
to
my
drinking
,
Disgrace
and
dule
to
ilka
Scot
,
that
sells
his
conscience
and
his
vote
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
discharged
a
third
sarcasm
at
a
person
very
gaily
dressed
,
who
had
risen
from
small
beginnings
,
and
made
a
considerabls
fortune
at
play
.
  
<EOS>
Filling
his
glass
,
and
calling
him
by
name
,
"
Lang
life
(
said
he
)
to
the
wylie
loon
that
gangs
a
-
field
with
a
toom
poke
at
his
lunzie
,
and
comes
hame
with
a
sackful
of
siller
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
these
toasts
being
received
with
loud
bursts
of
applause
,
Mr
Fraser
called
for
pint
glasses
,
and
filled
his
own
to
the
brim
:
then
standing
up
,
and
all
his
brethen
following
his
example
,
"
Ma
lords
and
gentlemen
(
cried
he
)
,
here
is
a
cup
of
thanks
for
the
great
and
undeserved
honour
you
have
done
your
poor
errand
-
boys
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
and
they
drank
off
their
glasses
in
a
trice
,
and
,
quitting
their
seat
,
took
their
station
each
behind
one
of
the
other
guests
;
 
exclaiming
,
"
<EOS>
Noo
we
're
your
honours
cawdies
again
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
nobleman
who
had
bore
the
first
brunt
of
Mr
Fraser
's
satire
,
objected
to
his
abdication
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
as
the
company
was
assembled
by
invitation
from
the
cawdies
,
he
expected
they
were
to
be
entertained
at
their
expence
.
"
<EOS>
By
no
means
,
my
lords
,
(
cried
Fraser
)
<EOS>
I
wad
na
be
guilty
of
sic
presumption
for
the
wide
warld
  
<EOS>
I
never
affronted
a
gentleman
since
I
was
born
;
and
sure
at
his
age
,
I
wonnot
offer
an
indignity
to
sic
an
honourable
convention
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
(
said
his
Lordship
)
as
you
have
expended
some
wit
,
you
have
a
right
to
save
your
money
.
<EOS>
You
have
given
me
good
counsel
,
and
I
take
it
in
good
part
.
<EOS>
As
you
have
voluntarily
quitted
your
seat
,
I
will
take
your
place
with
the
leave
of
the
good
company
,
ahd
think
myself
happy
to
be
hailed
,
Father
of
the
Feast
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
forthwith
elected
into
the
chair
,
and
complimented
in
a
bumper
in
his
new
character
.
    
<EOS>
The
claret
continued
to
circulate
without
interruption
,
till
the
glasses
seemed
to
dance
upon
the
table
,
and
this
,
perhaps
,
was
a
hint
to
the
ladies
to
call
for
music
  
<EOS>
At
eight
in
the
evening
the
ball
began
in
another
apartment
:
at
midnight
we
went
to
supper
;
but
it
was
broad
day
before
I
found
the
way
to
my
lodgings
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
his
Lordship
had
a
swinging
bill
to
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
;
I
have
lived
so
riotously
for
some
weeks
,
that
my
uncle
begins
to
be
alarmed
on
the
score
of
my
constitution
,
and
very
seriously
observes
,
that
all
his
own
infirmities
are
owing
to
such
excesses
indulged
in
his
youth
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
says
it
would
be
more
for
the
advantage
of
my
soul
as
well
as
body
,
if
,
instead
of
frequenting
these
scenes
of
debauchery
,
I
would
accompany
Mr
Moffat
and
her
to
hear
a
sermon
of
the
reverend
Mr
M'Corkindale
.
  
<EOS>
Clinker
often
exhorts
me
,
with
a
groan
,
to
take
care
of
my
precious
health
;
and
even
Archy
M'Alpine
,
when
he
happens
to
be
overtaken
,
(
which
is
oftener
the
case
than
I
could
wish
)
reads
me
a
long
lecture
upon
temperance
and
sobriety
;
and
is
so
very
wise
and
sententious
,
that
,
if
I
could
provide
him
with
a
professor
's
chair
,
I
would
willingly
give
up
the
benefit
of
his
admonitions
and
service
together
;
for
I
was
tutorsick
at
alma
mater
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
however
,
so
much
engrossed
by
the
gaieties
of
Edinburgh
,
but
that
I
find
time
to
make
parties
in
the
family
way
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
not
only
seen
all
the
villas
and
villages
within
ten
miles
of
the
capital
,
but
we
have
also
crossed
the
Firth
,
which
is
an
arm
of
the
sea
seven
miles
broad
,
that
divides
Lothian
from
the
shire
,
or
,
as
the
Scots
call
it
,
the
kingdom
of
Fife
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
number
of
large
open
sea
-
boats
that
ply
on
this
passage
from
Leith
to
Kinghorn
,
which
is
a
borough
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
our
whole
family
embarked
three
days
ago
,
excepting
my
sister
,
who
,
being
exceedingly
fearful
of
the
water
,
was
left
to
the
care
of
Mrs
Mitchelson
.
<EOS>
We
had
an
easy
and
quick
passage
into
Fife
,
where
we
visited
a
number
of
poor
towns
on
the
sea
-
side
,
including
St.
Andrew
's
,
which
is
the
skeleton
of
a
venerable
city
;
but
we
were
much
better
pleased
with
some
noble
and
elegant
seats
and
castles
,
of
which
there
is
a
great
number
in
that
part
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
we
took
boat
again
on
our
return
to
Leith
with
fair
wind
and
agreeable
weather
;
but
we
had
not
advanced
half
-
way
when
the
sky
was
suddenly
overcast
,
and
the
wind
changing
.
<EOS>
blew
directly
in
our
teeth
;
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
turn
,
or
tack
the
rest
,
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
gale
increased
to
a
storm
of
wind
and
rain
,
attended
with
such
a
fog
,
that
we
could
not
see
the
town
of
Leith
,
to
which
we
were
bound
,
nor
even
the
castle
of
Edinburgh
,
notwithstanding
its
high
situation
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
doubted
but
that
we
were
all
alarmed
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
And
at
the
same
time
,
most
of
the
passengers
were
seized
with
a
nausea
that
produced
violent
retchings
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
desired
her
brother
to
order
the
boatmen
to
put
back
to
Kinghorn
,
and
this
expedient
he
actually
proposed
;
but
they
assured
him
there
was
no
danger
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
finding
them
obstinate
,
began
to
scold
,
and
insisted
upon
my
uncle
's
exerting
his
authority
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
.
<EOS>
Sick
and
peevish
as
he
was
,
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
this
wise
proposal
,
telling
her
,
that
his
commission
did
not
extend
so
far
,
and
,
if
it
did
,
he
should
let
the
people
take
their
own
way
;
for
he
thought
it
would
be
great
presumption
in
him
to
direct
them
in
the
exercise
of
their
own
profession
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Winifred
Jenklns
made
a
general
clearance
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
joined
her
both
in
prayer
and
ejaculation
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
took
it
for
granted
that
we
should
not
be
long
in
this
world
,
he
offered
some
spiritual
consolation
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
who
rejected
it
with
great
disgust
,
bidding
him
keep
his
sermons
for
those
who
had
leisure
to
hear
such
nonsense
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
sat
,
recollected
in
himself
,
without
speaking
;
my
man
Archy
had
recourse
to
a
brandy
-
bottle
,
with
which
he
made
so
free
,
that
I
imagined
he
had
sworn
to
die
of
drinking
any
thing
rather
than
sea
-
water
:
but
the
brandy
had
no
more
effect
upon
him
in
the
way
of
intoxication
,
than
if
it
had
been
sea
water
in
good
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
myself
,
I
was
too
much
engrossed
by
the
sickness
at
my
stomach
,
to
think
of
any
thing
else
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
sea
swelled
mountains
high
,
the
boat
pitched
with
such
violence
,
as
if
it
had
been
going
to
pieces
;
the
cordage
rattled
,
the
wind
roared
;
the
lightning
flashed
,
the
thunder
bellowed
,
and
the
rain
descended
in
a
deluge
  
<EOS>
Every
time
the
vessel
was
put
about
,
we
ship'd
<EOS>
a
sea
that
drenched
us
all
to
the
skin
.
  
<EOS>
When
by
dint
of
turning
,
we
thought
to
have
cleared
the
pier
head
,
we
were
driven
to
leeward
,
and
then
the
boatmen
themselves
began
to
fear
that
the
tide
would
fail
before
we
should
fetch
up
our
lee
-
way
:
the
next
trip
,
however
,
brought
us
into
smooth
water
,
and
we
were
safely
landed
on
the
quay
,
about
one
o'clook
in
the
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
(
cried
Tabby
,
when
she
found
herself
on
terra
firma
,
)
<EOS>
we
must
all
have
perished
,
if
we
had
not
been
the
particular
care
of
Providence
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
(
replied
my
uncle
)
but
I
am
much
of
the
honest
highlander
's
mind
 
after
he
had
made
such
a
passage
as
this
:
his
friend
told
him
he
was
much
indebted
to
Providence
;
  
Certainly
,
(
said
Donald
)
but
,
by
my
saul
,
mon
,
I'se
ne'er
trouble
Providence
again
,
so
long
as
the
brig
of
Stirling
stands
.

You

the

I
do
n't
find
that

in

from
this

but
poor
Liddy
is
in

I
'm
afraid
this
unfortunate
girl
is
uneasy
in
her
mind
;
and
this
apprehension
distracts
me
,
for
she
is
really
an
amiable
creature

We

set
out

To
Dr
Lewis

<EOS>
I
SHOULD
be
very
ungrateful
,
dear
Lewis
,
if
I
did
not
find
myself
disposed
to
think
and
speak
favourably
of
this
people
,
among
whom
I
have
met
with
more
kindness
,
hospitality
,
and
rational
entertainment
,
in
a
few
weeks
,
than
ever
I
received
in
any
other
country
during
the
whole
course
of
my
life
.
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
the
gratitude
excited
by
these
benefits
may
interfere
with
the
impartiality
of
my
remarks
;
for
a
man
is
as
apt
to
be
prepossessed
by
particular
favours
as
to
be
prejudiced
by
private
motives
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
partial
,
there
is
,
at
least
,
some
merit
in
my
conversion
from
illiberal
prejudices
which
had
grown
up
with
my
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
impressions
which
an
Englishman
receives
in
this
country
,
will
not
contribute
to
the
removal
of
his
prejudices
;
because
he
refers
every
thing
he
sees
to
a
comparison
with
the
same
articles
in
his
own
country
;
and
this
comparison
is
unfavourable
to
Scotland
in
all
its
exteriors
,
such
as
the
face
of
the
country
in
respect
to
cultivation
,
the
appearance
of
the
bulk
of
the
people
,
and
the
language
of
conversation
in
general
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
far
convinced
by
Mr
Lismahago
's
arguments
,
buttl
at
<EOS>
I
think
the
Scots
would
do
well
,
for
their
own
sakes
,
to
adopt
the
English
idioms
and
pronunciation
;
those
of
them
especially
,
who
are
resolved
to
push
their
fortunes
in
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
by
experience
,
how
easily
an
Englishman
is
influenced
by
the
ear
,
and
how
apt
he
is
to
laugh
,
when
he
hears
his
own
language
spoken
with
a
foreign
or
provincial
accent
  
I
have
known
a
member
of
the
house
of
commons
speak
with
great
energy
and
precision
,
without
being
able
to
engage
attention
,
because
his
observations
were
made
in
the
Scotch
dialect
,
which
(
no
offence
to
lieutenant
Lismahago
)
certainly
gives
a
clownish
air
even
to
sentiments
of
the
greatest
dignity
and
decorum
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
declared
my
opinion
on
this
head
to
some
of
the
most
sensible
men
of
this
country
,
observing
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
if
they
would
employ
a
few
natives
of
England
to
teach
the
pronunciation
of
our
vernacular
tongue
,
in
twenty
years
there
would
be
no
difference
,
in
point
of
dialect
,
between
the
youth
of
Edinburgh
and
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
The
civil
regulations
of
this
kingdom
and
metropolis
are
taken
from
very
different
models
from
those
of
England
,
except
in
a
few
particular
establishments
,
the
necessary
consequences
of
the
union
.
  
<EOS>
Their
college
of
justice
is
a
bench
of
great
dignity
,
filled
with
judges
of
character
and
ability
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
heard
some
causes
tried
before
this
venerable
tribunal
;
and
was
very
much
pleased
with
the
pleadings
of
their
advocates
,
who
are
by
no
means
deficient
either
in
argument
or
elocution
.
<EOS>
The
Scottish
legislation
is
founded
,
in
a
great
measure
,
on
the
civil
law
;
consequently
,
their
proceedings
vary
from
those
of
the
English
tribunals
;
but
,
I
think
,
they
have
the
advantage
of
us
in
their
method
of
examining
witnesses
apart
,
and
in
the
constitution
of
their
jury
,
by
which
they
certainly
avoid
the
evil
which
I
mentioned
in
my
last
from
Lismahago
's
observation
.
    
<EOS>
The
university
of
Edinburgh
is
supplied
with
excellent
professors
in
all
the
sciences
;
and
the
medical
school
,
in
particular
,
is
famous
all
over
Europe
.
  
<EOS>
The
students
of
this
art
have
the
best
opportunity
of
learning
it
to
perfection
,
in
all
its
branches
,
as
there
are
different
courses
for
the
theory
of
medicine
,
and
the
practice
of
medicine
;
for
anatomy
,
chemistry
,
botany
,
and
the
materia
medica
,
over
and
above
those
of
mathematics
and
experimental
philosophy
;
and
all
these
are
given
by
men
of
distinguished
talents
.
<EOS>
What
renders
this
part
of
education
still
more
complete
,
is
the
advantage
of
attending
the
infirmary
,
which
is
the
best
instituted
charitable
foundation
that
I
ever
knew
.
<EOS>
Now
we
are
talking
of
charities
,
here
are
several
hospitals
,
exceedingly
well
endowed
,
and
maintained
under
admirable
regulations
;
and
these
are
not
only
useful
,
but
ornamental
to
the
city
.
<EOS>
Among
these
,
I
shall
only
mention
the
general
work
-
house
,
in
which
all
the
poor
,
not
otherwise
provided
for
,
are
employed
,
according
to
their
different
abilities
,
with
such
judgment
and
effect
,
that
they
nearly
maintain
themselves
by
their
labour
,
and
there
is
not
a
beggar
to
be
seen
within
the
precincts
of
this
metropolis
.
<EOS>
It
was
Glasgow
that
set
the
example
of
this
establishment
,
abour
thirty
years
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Even
the
kirk
of
Scotland
,
so
long
reproached
with
fanaticism
and
canting
,
abounds
at
present
with
ministers
celebrated
for
their
learning
,
and
respectable
for
their
moderation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
heard
their
sermons
with
equal
astonishment
and
pleasure
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
people
of
Edinburgh
no
longer
think
dirt
and
cob
-
webs
essential
to
the
house
of
god
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
their
churches
have
admitted
such
ornaments
as
would
have
excited
sedition
,
even
in
England
,
a
little
more
than
a
century
ago
;
and
psalmody
is
here
practised
and
taught
by
a
professor
from
the
cathedral
of
Durham
:
  
<EOS>
I
should
not
be
surprised
,
in
a
few
years
,
to
hear
it
accompanied
with
an
organ
.
    
<EOS>
Edinburgh
is
a
hot
-
bed
of
genius
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
made
acquainted
with
many
authors
of
the
first
distinction
;
such
as
the
two
Humes
,
Robertson
,
Smith
,
Wallace
,
Blair
,
Ferguson
,
Wilkie
,
&
c.
<EOS>
and
I
have
found
them
all
as
agreeable
in
conversation
as
they
are
instructive
and
entertaining
in
their
writings
.
<EOS>
These
acquaintances
I
owe
to
the
friendship
of
Dr
Carlyle
,
who
wants
nothing
but
inclination
to
figure
with
the
rest
upon
paper
.
<EOS>
The
magistracy
of
Edinburgh
is
changed
every
year
by
election
,
and
seems
to
be
very
well
adapted
both
for
state
and
authority
.
  
<EOS>
The
lord
provost
is
equal
in
dignity
to
the
lord
mayor
of
London
;
and
the
four
bailies
are
equivalent
to
the
rank
of
aldermen
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
dean
of
guild
,
who
takes
cognizance
of
mercantile
affairs
;
a
treasurer
;
a
town
-
clerk
;
and
the
council
is
composed
of
deacons
,
one
of
whom
is
returned
every
year
,
in
rotation
,
as
representative
of
every
company
of
artificers
or
handicraftsmen
.
<EOS>
though
this
city
,
from
the
nature
of
its
situation
,
can
never
be
made
either
very
convenient
or
very
cleanly
,
it
has
nevertheless
,
an
air
of
magnificence
that
commands
respect
.
  
<EOS>
The
castle
is
an
instance
of
the
sublime
in
scite
and
architecture
.
  
<EOS>
Its
fortifications
are
kept
in
good
order
,
and
there
is
always
in
it
a
garrison
of
regular
soldiers
,
which
is
relieved
every
year
;
but
it
is
incapable
of
sustaining
a
siege
carried
on
according
to
the
modern
operations
of
war
.
  
<EOS>
The
castle
hill
,
which
extends
from
the
outward
gate
to
the
upper
end
of
the
high
-
street
,
is
used
as
a
public
walk
for
the
citizens
,
and
commands
a
prospect
,
equally
extensive
and
delightful
,
over
the
county
of
Fife
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
Frith
,
and
all
along
the
sea
-
coast
,
which
is
covered
with
a
succession
of
towns
that
would
seem
to
indicate
a
considerable
share
of
commerce
;
but
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
,
these
towns
have
been
falling
to
decay
ever
since
the
union
,
by
which
the
Scots
were
in
a
great
measure
deprived
of
their
trade
with
France
.
  
<EOS>
The
palace
of
Holy
-
rood
-
house
is
a
jewel
in
architecture
,
thrust
into
a
hollow
where
it
can
not
be
seen
;
a
situation
which
was
certainly
not
chosen
by
the
ingenious
architect
,
who
must
have
been
confined
to
the
scite
of
the
old
palace
,
which
was
a
convent
.
<EOS>
Edinburgh
is
considerably
extended
on
the
south
side
,
where
there
are
divers
little
elegant
squares
built
in
the
English
manner
;
and
the
citizens
have
planned
some
improvements
on
the
north
,
which
,
when
put
in
execution
,
will
add
greatly
to
the
beauty
and
convenience
of
this
capital
.
    
<EOS>
The
sea
-
port
is
Leith
,
a
flourishing
town
,
about
a
mile
from
the
city
in
the
harbour
of
which
I
have
seen
above
one
hundred
ships
lying
all
together
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
I
had
the
curiosity
to
cross
the
Frith
in
a
passage
-
boat
,
and
stayed
two
days
in
Fife
,
which
is
remarkably
fruitful
in
corn
,
and
exhibits
a
surprising
number
of
fine
seats
,
elegantly
built
,
and
magnificently
furnished
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
incredible
number
of
noble
houses
in
every
part
of
Scotland
that
I
have
seen
.
  
<EOS>
Dalkeith
,
Pinkie
,
Yester
and
lord
Hopton
's
,
all
of
them
within
four
or
five
miles
of
Edinburgh
,
are
princely
palaces
,
in
every
one
of
which
a
sovereign
might
reside
at
his
ease
.
  
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
Scots
affect
these
monuments
of
grandeur
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
may
be
allowed
to
mingle
censure
with
my
remarks
upon
a
people
I
revere
,
I
must
observe
,
that
their
weak
side
seems
to
be
vanity
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
that
even
their
hospitality
is
not
quite
free
of
ostentation
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
have
discovered
among
them
uncommon
pains
taken
to
display
their
fine
linen
,
of
which
,
indeed
,
they
have
great
plenty
,
their
furniture
,
plate
,
house
keeping
and
variety
of
wines
,
in
which
article
,
it
must
be
owned
,
they
are
profuse
,
if
not
prodigal
.
  
<EOS>
A
burgher
of
Edinburgh
,
not
content
to
vie
with
a
citizen
of
London
,
who
has
ten
times
his
fortune
,
must
excel
him
in
the
expence
as
well
as
elegance
of
the
entertainments
.
    
<EOS>
Though
the
villas
of
the
Scotch
nobility
and
gentry
have
generally
an
air
of
grandeur
and
state
,
I
think
their
gardens
and
parks
are
not
comparable
to
those
of
England
;
a
circumstance
the
more
remarkable
,
as
I
was
told
by
the
ingenious
Mr
Phillip
Miller
of
Chelsea
,
that
almost
all
the
gardeners
of
Souht
-
Britain
were
natives
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
The
verdure
of
this
country
is
not
equal
to
that
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
The
pleasure
grounds
are
,
in
my
opinion
,
not
so
well
laid
out
according
to
the
genius
loci
;
nor
are
the
lawns
,
and
walks
,
and
hedges
kept
in
such
delicate
order
.
  
<EOS>
The
trees
are
planted
in
prudish
rows
,
which
have
not
such
an
agreeable
natural
effect
,
as
when
they
are
thrown
into
irregular
groupes
,
with
intervening
glades
;
and
the
firs
,
which
they
generally
raise
around
their
houses
,
look
dull
and
funeral
in
the
summer
season
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
confess
,
indeed
,
that
they
yield
serviceable
timber
,
and
good
shelter
against
the
northern
blasts
;
that
they
grow
and
thrive
in
the
most
barren
soil
,
and
continually
perspire
a
fine
balsam
of
turpentine
,
which
must
render
the
air
very
salutary
and
sanative
to
the
lungs
of
a
tender
texture
.
    
<EOS>
Tabby
and
I
have
been
both
frightned
in
our
return
by
sea
from
the
coast
of
Fife
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
afraid
of
drowning
,
and
<EOS>
I
of
catching
cold
,
in
consequence
of
being
drenched
with
sea
-
water
;
but
my
fears
,
as
well
as
her
's
,
have
been
happily
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
now
in
perfect
health
;
I
wish
I
could
say
the
same
of
Liddy
.
  
<EOS>
Something
uncommon
is
the
matter
with
that
poor
child
;
her
colour
fades
her
appetite
fails
,
and
her
spirits
flag
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
become
moping
and
melancholy
,
and
is
often
found
in
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
suspects
internal
uneasiness
on
account
of
Wilson
,
and
denounces
vengeance
against
that
adventurer
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
,
it
seems
,
strongly
affected
at
the
ball
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
one
Mr
Gordon
,
who
strongly
resembles
the
said
Wilson
;
but
I
am
rather
suspicious
that
she
caught
cold
by
being
overheated
with
dancing
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
consulted
Dr
Gregory
,
an
eminent
physician
of
an
amiable
character
,
who
advises
the
hiland
air
,
and
the
use
of
goat
-
milk
whey
,
which
,
surely
,
can
not
have
a
bad
effect
upon
a
patient
who
was
born
and
bred
among
the
mountains
of
Wales
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
opinion
is
the
more
agreeable
,
as
we
shall
find
those
remedies
in
the
very
place
which
I
proposed
as
the
utmost
extent
of
our
expedition
  
<EOS>
I
mean
the
borders
of
Argyle
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Smollet
,
one
of
the
judges
of
the
commissary
court
,
which
is
now
sitting

has
very
kindly
insisted
upon
our
lodging
at
his
country
house
,
on
the
banks
of
Lough
-
Lomond
,
about
fourteen
miles
beyond
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
For
this
last
city
we
shall
set
out
in
two
days
,
and
take
Stirling
in
our
way
,
well
provided
with
recommendations
from
our
friends
at
Edinburgh
,
whom
,
I
protest
,
I
shall
leave
with
much
regret

<EOS>
I
am
so
far
from
thinking
it
any
hardship
to
live
in
this
country
,
that
,
if
I

lead
a

Edinburgh
would
certainly
be

Dear
knight
,
I
AM
now
little
short
of
the
Ultima
Thule
,
if
this
appellation
properly
belongs
to
the
Orkneys
or
Hebrides
.
<EOS>
These
last
are
now
lying
before
me
,
to
the
amount
of
some
hundred
,
scattered
up
and
down
the
Deucalidonian
sea
,
affording
the
most
picturesque
and
romantic
prospect
I
ever
beheld
   
<EOS>
I
write
this
letter
in
a
gentleman
's
house
,
near
the
town
of
Inverary
,
which
may
be
deemed
the
capital
of
the
West
Highlands
,
famous
for
nothing
so
much
as
for
the
stately
castle
begun
,
and
actually
covered
in
by
the
late
duke
of
Argyle
,
at
a
prodigious
expence
  
Whether
it
will
ever
be
completely
finished
<EOS>
is
a
question
     
<EOS>
But
,
to
take
things
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
We
left
Edinburgh
ten
days
ago
;
and
the
further
North
we
proceed
,
we
find
Mrs
Tabitha
the
less
manageable
;
so
that
her
inclinations
are
not
of
the
nature
of
the
loadstone
;
they
point
not
towards
the
pole
.
<EOS>
What
made
her
leave
Edinburgh
with
reluctance
at
last
,
if
we
may
believe
her
own
assertions
,
was
a
dispute
which
she
left
unfinished
with
Mr
Moffat
,
touching
the
eternity
of
hell
torments
.
<EOS>
That
gentleman
,
as
he
advanced
in
years
,
began
to
be
sceptical
on
this
head
,
till
,
at
length
he
declared
open
war
against
the
common
acception
of
the
word
eternal
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
persuaded
,
that
eternal
signifies
no
more
than
an
indefinite
number
of
years
;
and
that
the
most
enormous
sinner
may
be
quit
for
nine
millions
,
nine
hundred
thousand
,
nine
hundred
and
ninety
-
nine
years
of
hell
fire
;
which
term
or
period
,
as
he
very
well
observes
,
forms
but
an
inconsiderable
drop
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
ocean
of
eternity
  
<EOS>
For
this
mitigation
he
contends
,
as
a
system
agreeable
to
the
ideas
of
goodness
and
mercy
,
which
we
annex
to
the
supreme
<EOS>
Being
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
seemed
willing
to
adopt
this
doctrine
in
favour
of
the
wicked
,
but
he
hinted
,
that
no
person
whatever
was
so
righteous
as
to
be
exempted
entirely
from
punishment
in
a
future
state
;
and
that
the
most
pious
Christian
upon
earth
might
think
himself
very
happy
to
get
off
for
a
fast
of
seven
or
eight
thousand
years
in
the
midst
of
fire
and
brimstone
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
revolted
at
this
dogma
,
which
filled
her
at
once
with
horror
and
indignation
  
<EOS>
She
had
recourse
to
the
opinion
of
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
roundly
declared
it
was
the
popish
doctrine
of
purgatory
,
and
quoted
scripture
in
defence
of
the
fire
everlasting
,
prepared
for
the
devil
and
his
angels
  
<EOS>
The
reverend
mester
Mackcorkendale
,
and
all
the
theologists
and
saints
of
that
persuasion
were
consulted
,
and
some
of
them
had
doubts
about
the
matter
;
which
doubts
and
scruples
had
begun
to
infect
our
aunt
,
when
we
took
our
departure
from
Edinburgh
.
    
<EOS>
We
passed
through
Linlithgow
,
where
there
was
an
elegant
royal
palace
,
which
is
now
gone
to
decay
,
as
well
as
the
town
itself
  
<EOS>
This
too
is
pretty
much
the
case
with
Stirling
,
though
it
still
boasts
of
a
fine
old
castle
,
in
which
the
kings
of
Scotland
were
wo
nt
to
reside
in
their
minority
  
<EOS>
But
Glasgow
is
the
pride
of
Scotland
,
and
,
indeed
,
it
might
very
well
pass
for
an
elegant
and
flourishing
city
in
any
part
of
Christendom
.
<EOS>
There
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
received
into
the
house
of
Mr
Moore
,
an
eminent
surgeon
,
to
whom
we
were
recommended
by
one
of
our
friends
at
Edinburgh
;
and
,
truly
,
he
could
not
have
done
us
more
essential
service
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moore
is
a
merry
facetious
companion
,
sensible
and
shrewd
,
with
a
considerable
fund
of
humour
;
and
his
wife
an
agreeable
woman
,
well
bred
,
kind
,
and
obliging
  
Kindness
,
which
I
take
to
be
the
essence
of
good
-
nature
and
humanity
,
is
the
distinguishing
characteristic
of
the
Scotch
ladies
in
their
own
country
  
<EOS>
Our
landlord
shewed
us
every
thing
,
and
introduced
us
to
all
the
world
at
Glasgow
;
where
,
through
his
recommendation
,
we
were
complimented
with
the
freedom
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
trade
and
opulence
of
this
place
,
it
can
not
but
abound
with
gaiety
and
diversions
  
<EOS>
Here
is
a
great
number
of
young
fellows
that
rival
the
youth
of
the
capital
in
spirit
and
expence
;
and
I
was
soon
convinced
,
that
all
the
female
beauties
of
Scotland
were
not
assembled
at
the
hunters
ball
in
Edinburgh
  
<EOS>
The
town
of
Glasgow
flourishes
in
learning
,
as
well
as
in
commerce
  
<EOS>
Here
is
an
university
,
with
professors
in
all
the
different
branches
of
science
,
liberally
endowed
,
and
judiciously
chosen
  
<EOS>
It
was
vacation
time
when
I
passed
,
so
that
I
could
not
entirely
satisfy
my
curiosity
;
but
their
mode
of
education
is
certainly
preferable
to
ours
in
some
respects
  
The
students
are
not
left
to
the
private
instruction
of
tutors
;
but
taught
in
public
schools
or
classes
,
each
science
by
its
particular
professor
or
regent
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
in
raptures
with
Glasgow
  
<EOS>
He
not
only
visited
all
the
manufactures
of
the
place
,
but
made
excursions
all
round
,
to
Hamilton
,
Paisley
,
Renfrew
,
and
every
other
place
within
a
dozen
miles
,
where
there
was
any
thing
remarkable
to
be
seen
in
art
or
nature
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
exercise
,
occasioned
by
these
jaunts
,
was
of
service
to
my
sister
Liddy
,
whose
appetite
and
spirits
begin
to
revive
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
displayed
her
attractions
as
usual
,
and
actually
belived
she
had
entangled
one
Mr
Maclellan
,
a
rich
inkle
manufacturer
,
in
her
snares
;
but
when
matters
came
to
an
explanation
,
it
appeared
that
his
attachment
was
altogether
spiritual
,
founded
upon
an
intercourse
of
devotion
,
at
the
meeting
of
Mr
John
Wesley
;
who
,
in
the
course
of
his
evangelical
mission
,
had
come
hither
in
person
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
we
set
out
for
the
banks
of
Lough
-
Lomond
,
passing
through
the
little
borough
of
Dumbarton
,
or
(
as
my
uncle
will
have
it
)
<EOS>
Dunbritton
,
where
there
is
a
castle
more
curious
than
any
thing
of
the
kind
I
had
ever
seen
  
<EOS>
It
is
honoured
with
a
particular
description
by
the
elegant
Buchannan
,
as
an
arx
inexpugnabilis
,
and
,
indeed
,
it
must
have
been
impregnable
by
the
ancient
manner
of
besieging
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
rock
of
considerable
extent
,
rising
with
a
double
top
,
in
an
angle
formed
by
the
confluence
of
two
rivers
,
the
Clyde
and
the
Leven
;
perpendicular
and
inaccessible
on
all
sides
,
except
in
one
place
where
the
entrance
is
fortified
;
and
there
is
no
rising
-
ground
in
the
neighbourhood
from
whence
<EOS>
it
could
be
damaged
by
any
kind
of
battery
.
    
<EOS>
From
Dumbarton
,
the
west
Highlands
appear
in
the
form
of
huge
,
dusky
mountains
,
piled
one
over
another
;
but
this
prospect
is
not
at
all
surprising
to
a
native
of
Glamorgan
  
<EOS>
We
have
fixed
our
headquarters
at
Cameron
,
a
very
neat
country
-
house
belonging
to
comissary
Smollet
,
where
we
found
every
sort
of
accommodation
we
could
desire
  
<EOS>
It
is
situated
like
a
Druid
's
temple
,
in
a
grove
of
oak
,
close
by
the
side
of
Lough
-
Lomond
,
which
is
a
surprising
body
of
pure
transparent
water
,
unfathomably
deep
in
many
places
,
six
or
seven
miles
broad
,
four
and
twenty
miles
in
length
,
displaying
above
twenty
green
islands
,
covered
with
wood
;
some
of
them
cultivated
for
corn
,
and
many
of
them
stocked
with
red
deer
  
<EOS>
They
belong
to
different
gentlemen
,
whose
seats
are
scattered
along
the
banks
of
the
lake
,
which
are
agreeably
romantic
beyond
all
conception
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
have
left
the
women
at
Cameron
,
as
Mrs
Tabitha
would
by
no
means
trust
herself
again
upon
the
water
,
and
to
come
hither
<EOS>
it
was
necessary
to
cross
a
small
inlet
of
the
sea
,
in
an
open
ferry
-
boat
  
<EOS>
This
country
appears
more
and
more
wild
and
savage
the
further
we
advance
;
and
the
people
are
as
different
from
the
Low
-
land
Scots
,
in
their
looks
,
garb
,
and
language
,
as
the
mountaineers
of
Brecknock
are
from
the
inhabitants
of
Herefordshire
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
Lowlanders
want
to
drink
a
chear
-
upping
-
cup
,
they
go
to
the
public
house
,
called
the
Change
-
house
,
and
call
for
a
chopine
of
two
-
penny
,
which
is
a
thin
,
yeasty
beverage
,
made
of
malt
;
not
quite
so
strong
as
the
table
-
beer
of
England
  
<EOS>
This
is
brought
in
a
pewter
stoop
,
shaped
like
a
skittle
,
from
whence
it
is
emptied
into
a
quaff
;
that
is
,
a
curious
cup
made
of
different
pieces
of
wood
,
such
as
box
and
ebony
,
cut
into
little
staves
,
joined
alternately
,
and
secured
with
delicate
hoops
,
have
two
ears
or
handles
  
<EOS>
It
holds
about
a
gill
,
is
sometimes
tipt
round
the
mouth
with
silver
,
and
has
a
plate
of
the
same
metal
at
bottom
,
with
the
landlord
's
cypher
engraved
  
<EOS>
The
Highlanders
,
on
the
contrary
,
despise
this
liquor
,
and
regale
themselves
with
whisky
;
a
malt
spirit
,
as
strong
as
geneva
,
which
they
swallow
in
great
quantities
,
without
any
signs
of
inebriation
.
<EOS>
They
are
used
to
it
from
the
cradle
,
and
find
it
an
excellent
preservative
against
the
winter
cold
,
which
must
be
extreme
on
these
mountains
  
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
it
is
given
with
great
success
to
infants
,
as
a
cordial
in
the
confluent
small
-
pox
,
when
the
eruption
seems
to
flag
,
and
the
symptoms
grow
unfavourable
  
The
Highlanders
are
used
to
eat
much
more
animal
food
than
falls
to
the
share
of
their
neighbours
in
the
Low
-
country
  
<EOS>
They
delight
in
hunting
;
having
plenty
of
deer
and
other
game
,
with
a
great
number
of
sheep
,
goats
,
and
black
cattle
running
wild
,
which
they
scruple
not
to
kill
as
venison
,
without
being
at
much
pains
to
ascertain
the
property
.
    
<EOS>
Inverary
is
but
a
poor
town
,
though
it
stands
immediately
under
the
protection
of
the
duke
of
Argyle
,
who
is
a
mighty
prince
in
this
part
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
The
peasants
live
in
wretched
cabbins
,
and
seem
very
poor
;
but
the
gentlemen
are
tolerably
well
lodged
,
and
so
loving
to
strangers
,
that
a
man
runs
some
risque
of
his
life
from
their
hospitality
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
observed
that
the
poor
Highlanders
are
now
seen
to
disadvantage
  
<EOS>
They
have
been
not
only
disarmed
by
act
of
parliament
;
but
also
deprived
of
their
ancient
garb
,
which
was
both
graceful
and
convenient
;
and
what
is
a
greater
hardship
still
,
they
are
compelled
to
wear
breeches
;
a
restraint
which
they
can
not
bear
with
any
degree
of
patience
:
indeed
,
the
majority
wear
them
,
not
in
the
proper
place
,
but
on
poles
or
long
staves
over
their
shoulders
  
<EOS>
They
are
even
debarred
the
use
of
their
striped
stuff
,
called
Tartane
,
which
was
their
own
manufacture
,
prized
by
them
above
all
the
velvets
,
brocards
,
and
tissues
of
Europe
and
Asia
.
<EOS>
They
now
lounge
along
in
loose
great
coats
,
of
coarse
russet
,
equally
mean
and
cumbersome
,
and
betray
manifest
marks
of
dejection
  
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
the
government
could
not
have
taken
a
more
effectual
method
to
break
their
national
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
had
princely
sport
in
hunting
the
flag
on
these
mountains
  
<EOS>
These
are
the
lonely
hills
of
Morven
,
where
Fingal
and
his
heroes
enjoyed
the
same
pastime
:
I
feel
an
enthusiastic
pleasure
when
I
survey
the
brown
heath
that
Ossian
wo
nt
to
tread
;
and
hear
the
wind
whistle
through
the
bending
grass
  
<EOS>
When
I
enter
our
landlord
's
hall
,
I
look
for
the
suspended
harp
of
that
divine
bard
,
and
listen
in
hopes
of
hearing
the
aerial
sound
of
his
respected
spirit
  
<EOS>
The
Poems
of
Ossian
are
in
every
mouth

A
famous
antiquarian
of
this
country
,
the
laird
of
Mackfarlane
,
at
whose
house
we
dined
a
few
days
ago
,
can
repeat
them
all
in
the
original
Gaelick
,
which
has
a
great
affinity
to
the
Welch
,
not
only
in
the
general
sound
,
but
also
in
a
great
number
of
adical
words
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
they
are
both
sprung
from
the
same
origin
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
a
little
surprised
,
when
asking
a
Highlander
one
day
,
if
he
knew
where
we
should
find
any
game
?
<EOS>
he
replied
,
"
bu
niel
Sassenagh
,
"
which
signifies
no
English
:
<EOS>
the
very
same
answer
I
should
have
received
from
a
Welchman
,
and
almost
in
the
same
words
.
<EOS>
The
Highlanders
have
no
other
name
for
the
people
of
the
Low
-
country
,
but
Sassenagh
,
or
Saxons
;
a
strong
presumption
,
that
the
Lowland
Scots
and
the
English
are
derived
from
the
same
stock
  
<EOS>
The
peasants
of
these
hills
strongly
resemble
those
of
Wales
in
their
looks
,
their
manners
,
and
habitations
;
every
thing
I
see
,
and
hear
,
and
feel
,
seems
Welch
  
<EOS>
The
mountains
,
vales
,
and
streams
;
the
air
and
climate
;
the
beef
,
mutton
,
and
game
,
are
all
Welch
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
owned
,
however
,
that
this
people
are
better
provided
than
we
in
some
articles
  
<EOS>
They
have
plenty
of
red
deer
and
roebuck
,
which
are
fat
and
delicious
at
this
season
of
the
year
  
Their
sea
teems
with
amazing
quantities
of
the
finest
fish
in
the
world
;
and
they
find
means
to
procure
very
good
claret
at
a
very
small
expence
.

ian
,
signifying
Dougal
,
the
son
of
James
,
the
son
of
Dougal
,
the
son
of
John
  
<EOS>
He
has
travelled
in
the
course
of
his
education
,
and
is
disposed
to
make
certain
alterations
in
his
domestic
oeconomy
;
but
he
finds
it
impossible
to
abolish
the
ancient
customs
of
the
family
;
some
of
which
are
ludicrous
enough
  
<EOS>
His
piper
,
for
example
,
who
is
an
hereditary
officer
of
the
household
,
will
not
part
with
the
least
particle
of
his
privileges
  
<EOS>
He
has
a
right
to
wear
the
kilt
,
or
ancient
Highland
dress
,
with
the
purse
,
pistol
,
and
durk
 
a
broad
yellow
ribbon
,
fixed
to
the
chanter
-
pipe
,
is
thrown
over
his
shoulder
,
and
trails
along
the
ground
,
while
he
performs
the
function
of
his
minstrelsy
;
and
this
,
I
suppose
,
is
analogous
to
the
pennon
or
flag
which
was
formerly
carried
before
every
knight
in
battle
  
<EOS>
He
plays
before
the
laird
every
Sunday
in
his
way
to
the
kirk
,
which
he
circles
three
times
,
performing
the
family
march
,
which
implies
defiance
to
all
the
enemies
of
the
clan
;
and
every
morning
he
plays
a
full
hour
by
the
clock
,
in
the
great
hall
,
marching
backwards
and
forwards
all
the
time
,
with
a
solemn
pace
,
attended
by
the
laird
's
kinsmen
,
who
seem
much
delighted
with
the
music
  
<EOS>
In
this
exercise
,
he
indulges
them
with
a
variety
of
pibrachs
or
airs
,
suited
to
the
different
passions
,
which
he
would
either
excite
or
assuage
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Campbell
himself
,
who
performs
very
well
on
the
violin
,
has
an
invincible
antipathy
to
the
sound
of
the
Highland
bag
-
pipe
,
which
sings
in
the
nose
with
a
most
alarming
twang
,
and
,
indeed
,
is
quite
intolerable
to
ears
of
common
sensibility
,
when
aggravated
by
the
echo
of
a
vaulted
hall
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
begged
the
piper
would
have
some
mercy
upon
him
,
and
dispense
with
this
part
of
the
morning
service
  
<EOS>
A
consultation
of
the
clan
being
held
on
this
occasion
,
it
was
unanimously
agreed
,
that
the
laird
's
request
could
not
be
granted
without
a
dangerous
encroachment
upon
the
customs
of
the
family
  
<EOS>
The
piper
declared
,
he
could
not
give
up
for
a
moment
the
privilege
he
derived
from
his
ancestors
;
nor
would
the
laird
's
relations
forego
an
entertainment
which
they
valued
above
all
others
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
remedy
;
Mr
Campbell
,
being
obliged
to
acquiesce
,
is
fain
to
stop
his
ears
with
cotton
;
to
fortify
his
head
with
three
or
four
night
-
caps
,
and
every
morning
retire
into
the
penetralia
of
his
habitation
,
in
order
to
avoid
this
diurnal
annoyance
.
<EOS>
When
the
music
ceases
,
he
produces
himself
at
an
open
window
that
looks
into
the
court
-
yard
,
which
is
by
this
time
filled
with
a
crowd
of
his
vassals
and
dependents
,
who
worship
his
first
appearance
,
by
uncovering
their
heads
,
and
bowing
to
the
earth
with
the
most
humble
prostration
.
<EOS>
As
all
these
people
have
something
to
communicate
in
the
way
of
proposal
,
complaint
,
or
petition
,
they
wait
patiently
till
the
laird
comes
forth
,
and
,
following
him
in
his
walks
,
are
favoured
each
with
a
short
audience
in
his
turn
.
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
,
he
dispatched
above
an
hundred
different
solicitors
,
in
walking
with
us
to
the
house
of
a
neighbouring
gentleman
,
where
we
dined
by
invitation
.
<EOS>
Our
landlord
's
house
-
keeping
is
equally
rough
and
hospitable
,
and
favours
much
of
simplicity
of
ancient
times
:
the
great
hall
,
paved
with
flat
stones
,
is
about
forty
-
five
feet
by
twenty
-
two
,
and
serves
not
only
for
a
dining
-
room
,
but
also
for
a
bed
-
chamber
to
gentlemen
-
dependents
and
hangers
-
on
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
half
a
dozen
occasional
beds
are
ranged
on
each
side
along
the
wall
.
<EOS>
These
are
made
of
fresh
heath
,
pulled
up
by
the
roots
,
and
disposed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
make
a
very
agreeable
couch
,
where
they
lie
,
without
any
other
covering
than
the
plaid
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
I
were
indulged
with
separate
chambers
and
down
beds
,
which
we
begged
to
exchange
for
a
layer
of
heath
;
and
indeed
I
never
slept
so
much
to
my
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
soft
and
elastic
,
but
the
plant
,
being
in
flower
,
diffused
an
agreeable
fragrance
which
is
wonderfully
refreshing
and
restorative
.
    
<EOS>
Yesterday
we
were
invited
to
the
funeral
of
an
old
lady
,
the
grand
-
mother
of
a
gentleman
in
this
neighbourhood
,
and
found
ourselves
in
the
midst
of
fifty
people
,
who
were
regaled
with
a
sumptuous
feast
,
accompanied
by
the
music
of
a
dozen
pipers
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
meeting
had
all
the
air
of
a
grand
festival
;
and
the
guests
did
such
honour
to
the
entertainment
,
that
many
of
them
could
not
stand
when
we
were
reminded
of
the
business
on
which
we
had
met
.
<EOS>
The
company
forthwith
taking
horse
,
rode
in
a
very
irregular
cavalcade
to
the
place
of
interment
,
a
church
,
at
the
distance
of
two
long
miles
from
the
castle
.
<EOS>
On
our
arrival
,
however
,
we
found
we
had
committed
a
small
oversight
,
in
leaving
the
corpse
behind
;
so
that
we
were
obliged
to
wheel
about
,
and
met
the
old
gentlewoman
half
way
,
carried
upon
poles
by
the
nearest
relations
of
her
family
,
and
attended
by
the
coronach
,
composed
of
a
multitude
of
old
hags
,
who
tore
their
hair
,
beat
their
breasts
,
and
howled
most
hideously
.
<EOS>
At
the
grave
,
the
orator
,
or
 
senachie
,
pronounced
the
panegyric
of
the
defunct
,
every
period
being
confirmed
by
a
yell
of
the
coronach
.
<EOS>
The
body
was
committed
to
the
earth
,
the
pipers
playing
a
pibroch
all
the
time
;
and
all
the
company
standing
uncovered
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
was
closed
with
the
discharge
of
pistols
;
then
we
returned
to
the
castle
,
resumed
the
bottle
,
and
by
midnight
there
was
not
a
sober
person
in
the
family
,
the
females
exepted
.
<EOS>
The
squire
and
I
were
,
with
some
difficulty
,
permitted
to
retire
with
our
landlord
in
the
evening
;
but
our
intertainer
was
a
little
chagrined
at
our
retreat
;
and
afterwards
seemed
to
think
it
a
disparagement
to
his
family
,
that
not
above
a
hundred
gallons
of
whiskey
had
been
drank
upon
such
a
solemn
occasion
.
<EOS>
This
morning
we
got
up
by
four
,
to
hunt
the
roebuck
,
and
,
in
half
an
hour
,
found
breakfast
ready
served
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
hunters
consisted
of
Sir
George
Colquhoun
and
me
,
as
strangers
,
(
my
uncle
not
choosing
to
be
of
the
party
)
of
the
laird
in
person
,
the
laird
's
brother
,
the
laird
's
brother
's
son
,
the
laird
's
sister
's
son
,
the
laird
's
father
's
brother
's
son
,
,
and
all
their
foster
brothers
,
who
are
counted
parcel
of
the
family
:
but
we
were
attended
by
an
infinite
number
of
Gaellys
,
or
ragged
Highlanders
,
without
shoes
or
stockings
.
    
<EOS>
The
following
articles
formed
our
morning
's
repast
:
one
kit
of
boiled
eggs
;
a
second
,
full
of
butter
;
a
third
,
full
of
cream
;
an
entire
cheese
,
made
of
goat
's
milk
;
a
large
earthen
pot
full
of
honey
;
the
best
part
of
a
ham
;
a
cold
venison
pasty
;
a
bushel
of
oat
meal
,
made
in
thin
cakes
and
bannocks
,
with
a
small
wheaten
loaf
in
the
middle
for
the
strangers
;
a
large
stone
bottle
full
of
whisky
,
another
of
brandy
,
and
a
kilderkin
of
ale
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
ladle
chained
to
the
cream
kit
,
with
curious
wooden
bickers
to
be
filled
from
this
reservoir
.
<EOS>
The
spirits
were
drank
out
of
a
silver
quaff
,
and
the
ale
out
of
horns
:
<EOS>
great
justice
was
done
to
the
collation
by
the
guests
in
general
;
one
of
them
in
particular
ate
above
two
dozen
of
hard
eggs
,
with
a
proportionable
quantity
of
bread
,
butter
,
and
honey
;
nor
was
one
drop
of
liquor
left
upon
the
board
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
a
large
roll
of
tobacco
was
presented
by
way
of
desart
,
and
every
individual
took
a
comfortable
quid
to
prevent
,
the
bad
effects
of
the
morning
air
.
<EOS>
We
had
a
fine
chase
over
the
mountains
,
after
a
roebuck
,
which
we
killed
,
and
I
got
home
time
enough
to
drink
tea
with
Mrs
Campbell
and
our
"
squire
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
we
shall
set
out
on
our
return
for
Cameron
.
<EOS>
We
propose
to
cross
the
Firth
of
Clyde
,
and
take
the
towns
of
Greenock
and
Port
-
Glasgow
in
our
way
.
<EOS>
This
circuit
being
finished
,
we
shall
turn
our
faces
to
the
south
,
and
follow
the
sun
with
augmented
velocity
,
in
order
to
enjoy
the
rest
of
the
autumn
in
England
,
where
Boreas
is
not
quite
so
biting
as
he
begins
already
to
be
on
the
tops
of
these
northern
hills
.
<EOS>
But
our
progress
from
place
to
place
shall
continue
to
be
specified
in
these
detached
journals

To

<EOS>
DEAR
DICK
,
ABOUT
a
fornight
is
now
elapsed
since
we
left
the
capital
of
Scotland
,
directing
our
course
towards
Stirling
,
where
we
lay
  
<EOS>
The
castle
of
this
place
is
such
another
as
that
of
Edinburgh
,
and
affords
a
surprising
prospect
of
the
windings
of
the
river
Forth
,
which
are
so
extraordinary
,
that
the
distance
from
hence
to
Alloa
,
by
land
,
is
but
four
miles
,
and
by
water
it
is
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
Alloa
is
a
neat
thriving
town
,
that
depends
in
a
great
measure
on
the
commerce
of
Glasgow
,
the
merchants
of
which
send
hither
tobacco
and
other
articles
,
to
be
deposited
in
warehouses
for
exportation
from
the
Frith
of
Forth
.
<EOS>
In
our
way
hither
we
visited
a
flourishing
iron
-
work
,
where
,
instead
of
burning
wood
,
they
use
coal
,
which
they
have
the
art
of
clearing
in
such
a
manner
as
frees
it
from
the
sulphur
,
that
would
otherwise
,
render
the
metal
too
brittle
for
working
.
<EOS>
Excellent
coal
is
found
in
almost
every
part
of
Scotland
.
    
<EOS>
The
soil
of
this
district
produces
scarce
any
other
grain
but
oats
and
barley
;
perhaps
because
it
is
poorly
cultivated
,
and
almost
altogether
uninclosed
.
<EOS>
The
few
inclosures
they
have
consist
of
paultry
walls
of
loose
stones
gathered
from
the
fields
,
which
indeed
they
cover
,
as
if
they
had
been
scattered
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
When
I
expressed
my
surprize
that
the
peasants
did
not
discumber
their
grounds
of
these
stones
;
a
gentleman
,
well
acquainted
with
the
theory
as
well
as
practice
of
farming
,
assured
me
that
the
stones
,
far
from
being
prejudicial
,
were
serviceable
to
the
crop
.
<EOS>
This
philosoper
had
ordered
a
field
of
his
own
to
be
cleared
,
manured
and
sown
with
barley
,
and
the
produce
was
more
scanty
than
before
.
<EOS>
He
caused
the
stones
to
be
replaced
,
and
next
year
the
crop
was
as
good
as
ever
.
<EOS>
The
stones
were
removed
a
second
time
,
and
the
harvest
failed
;
they
were
again
brought
back
,
and
the
ground
retrieved
its
fertility
.
<EOS>
The
same
experiment
has
been
tried
in
different
parts
of
Scotland
with
the
same
success
  
Astonished
at
this
information
,
I
desired
to
know
in
what
manner
he
accounted
for
this
strange
phenomenon
;
and
he
said
there
were
three
ways
in
which
the
stons
might
be
serviceable
.
<EOS>
They
might
possibly
restrain
an
excess
in
the
perspiration
of
the
earth
,
analogous
to
colliquative
sweats
,
by
which
the
human
body
is
sometimes
wasted
and
consumed
.
<EOS>
They
might
act
as
so
many
sences
to
protect
the
tender
blade
from
the
piercing
winds
of
the
spring
;
or
,
by
multiplying
the
reflexion
of
the
sun
,
they
might
increase
the
warmth
so
as
to
mitigate
the
natural
chilness
of
the
soil
and
climate
  
<EOS>
But
,
surely
,
this
excessive
perspiration
might
be
more
effectually
checked
by
different
kinds
of
manure
,
such
as
ashes
,
lime
,
chalk
,
or
marl
,
of
which
last
<EOS>
it
seems
there
are
many
pits
in
this
kingdom
:
<EOS>
as
for
the
warmth
,
it
would
be
much
more
;
equally
obtained
by
inclosures
;
one
half
of
the
ground
which
is
now
covered
,
would
be
retrieved
;
the
cultivation
would
require
less
labour
;
and
the
ploughs
,
harrows
,
and
horses
,
would
not
suffer
half
the
damage
which
they
now
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
These
north
-
western
parts
are
by
no
means
fertile
in
corn
.
<EOS>
The
ground
is
naturally
barren
and
moorish
.
<EOS>
The
peasants
are
poorly
lodged
,
meagre
in
their
looks
,
mean
in
their
apparel
,
and
remarkably
dirty
.
<EOS>
This
last
reproach
they
might
easily
wash
off
by
means
of
those
lakes
,
rivers
,
and
rivulets
of
pure
water
,
with
which
they
are
so
liberally
supplied
by
nature
.
<EOS>
Agriculture
can
not
be
expected
to
flourish
where
the
farms
are
small
,
the
leases
short
,
and
the
husbandman
begins
upon
a
rack
rent
,
without
a
sufficient
stock
to
answer
the
purposes
of
improvement
.
<EOS>
The
granaries
of
Scotland
are
the
banks
of
the
Tweed
,
the
counties
of
East
and
Mid
-
Lothian
,
the
Carse
of
Gowrie
,
in
Perthshire
,
equal
in
fertility
to
any
part
of
England
,
and
some
tracts
in
Aberdeenshire
and
Murray
,
where
I
am
told
the
harvest
is
more
early
than
in
Northumberland
,
although
they
lie
above
two
degrees
farther
north
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
strong
curiosity
to
visit
many
places
beyond
the
Forth
and
the
Tay
,
such
as
Perth
,
Dundee
,
Montrose
,
and
Aberdeen
,
which
are
towns
equally
elegant
and
thriving
;
but
the
season
is
too
far
advanced
,
to
admit
of
this
addition
to
my
original
plan
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
so
far
happy
as
to
have
seen
Glasgow
,
which
,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
and
judgment
,
is
one
of
the
prettiest
towns
in
Europe
;
and
,
without
all
doubt
,
it
is
one
of
the
most
flourishing
in
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
it
is
a
perfect
bee
-
hive
in
point
of
industry
.
<EOS>
It
stands
partly
on
a
gentle
declivity
;
but
the
greatest
part
of
it
is
in
a
plain
,
watered
by
the
river
Clyde
.
<EOS>
The
streets
are
straight
,
open
,
airy
,
and
well
paved
;
and
the
houses
lofty
and
well
built
of
hewn
stone
.
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
of
the
town
,
there
is
venerable
cathedral
,
that
may
be
compared
with
York
-
minster
or
Westminster
;
and
,
about
the
middle
of
the
descent
from
this
to
the
Cross
,
is
the
college
,
a
respectable
pile
of
building
,
with
all
manner
of
accommodation
for
the
professors
and
students
,
including
an
elegant
library
,
and
an
observatory
well
provided
with
astronomical
instruments
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
inhabitants
is
said
to
amount
to
thirty
thousand
;
and
marks
of
opulence
and
independency
appear
in
every
quarter
of
this
commercial
city
,
which
,
however
,
is
not
without
its
inconveniences
and
detects
:
The
water
of
their
public
pumps
is
generally
hard
and
brackish
,
an
imperfection
the
less
excusable
,
as
the
river
Clyde
runs
by
their
doors
,
in
the
lower
part
of
the
town
,
and
there
are
rivulets
and
springs
above
the
cathedral
,
sufficient
to
fill
a
large
reservoir
with
excellent
water
,
which
might
be
thence
distributed
to
all
the
different
parts
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
It
is
of
more
consequence
to
consult
the
health
of
the
inhabitants
in
this
article
,
than
to
employ
so
much
attention
in
beautifying
their
town
with
new
streets
,
squares
,
and
churches
.
<EOS>
Another
defect
,
not
so
easily
remedied
,
is
the
shallowness
of
the
river
,
which
will
not
float
vessels
of
any
burden
within
ten
or
twelve
miles
of
the
city
;
so
that
the
merchants
are
obliged
to
load
and
unload
their
ships
at
Greenock
and
Port
-
Glasgow
,
situated
about
fourteen
miles
nearer
the
mouth
of
the
Firth
,
where
it
is
about
two
miles
broad
.
    
<EOS>
The
people
of
Glasgow
have
a
noble
spirit
of
enterprise
  
<EOS>
Mr
Moore
,
a
surgeon
,
to
whom
I
was
recommended
from
Edinburgh
,
introuduced
me
to
all
the
principal
merchants
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Here
I
became
acquainted
with
Mr
Cochran
,
who
may
be
stiled
one
of
the
sages
of
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
He
was
first
magistrate
at
the
time
of
the
last
rebellion
.
<EOS>
I
sat
as
member
when
he
was
examined
in
the
house
of
commons
;
upon
which
occasion
Mr
P
#
#
#
#
observed
he
had
never
heard
such
a
sensible
evidence
given
at
that
bar
  
<EOS>
I
was
also
introduced
to
Dr
John
Gordon
,
a
patriot
of
a
truly
Roman
spirit
,
who
is
the
father
of
the
linen
manufacture
in
this
place
,
and
was
the
great
promoter
of
the
city
work
-
house
,
infirmary
,
and
other
works
of
public
utility
.
<EOS>
Had
he
lived
in
ancient
Rome
,
he
would
have
been
honoured
with
a
statue
at
the
public
expence
.
<EOS>
I
moreover
conversed
with
one
Mr
G####ssf####d
,
whom
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
merchants
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
war
,
he
is
said
to
have
had
at
one
time
five
and
twenty
ships
,
with
their
cargoes
,
his
own
property
,
and
to
have
traded
for
above
half
a
million
sterling
a
year
.
<EOS>
The
last
war
was
a
fortunate
period
for
the
commerce
of
Glasgow
  
<EOS>
The
merchants
,
considering
that
their
ships
bound
for
America
,
launching
out
at
once
into
the
Atlantic
by
the
north
of
Ireland
,
pursued
a
track
very
little
frequented
by
privateers
,
resolved
to
insure
one
another
and
saved
a
very
considerable
sum
by
this
resolution
,
as
few
or
none
of
their
ships
were
taken
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
I
have
a
sort
of
national
attachment
to
this
part
of
Scotland
  
<EOS>
The
great
church
dedicated
to
St.
Mongah
,
the
river
Clyde
,
and
other
particulars
that
smack
of
our
Welch
language
and
customs
,
contribute
to
flatter
me
with
the
notion
,
that
these
people
are
the
descendants
of
the
Britons
,
who
once
possessed
this
country
.
<EOS>
Without
all
question
,
this
was
a
Cumbrian
kingdom
:
<EOS>
its
capital
was
Dumbarton
(
a
corruption
of
Dunbritton
)
which
still
exists
as
a
royal
borough
,
at
the
influx
of
the
Clyde
and
Leven
,
ten
miles
below
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
The
same
neighbourhood
gave
birth
to
St.
Patrick
,
the
apostle
of
Ireland
,
at
a
place
where
there
is
still
a
church
and
village
,
which
retain
his
name
.
<EOS>
Hard
by
are
some
vestiges
of
the
famous
Roman
wall
,
built
in
the
reign
of
Antonine
,
from
the
Clyde
to
the
Forth
,
and
fortified
with
castles
,
to
restrain
the
incursions
of
the
Scots
or
Caledonians
,
who
inhabited
the
west
-
Highlands
.
<EOS>
In
a
line
parallel
to
this
wall
,
the
merchants
of
Gsasgow
have
determined
to
make
a
navigable
canal
betwixt
the
two
Friths
,
which
will
be
of
incredible
advantage
to
their
commerce
,
in
transporting
merchandize
from
one
side
of
the
island
to
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
From
Glasgow
we
travelled
along
the
Clyde
,
which
is
a
delightful
stream
,
adorned
on
both
sides
with
villas
,
towns
,
and
,
villages
.
<EOS>
Here
is
no
want
of
groves
,
and
meadows
,
and
corn
-
fields
interspersed
;
but
on
this
side
of
Glasgow
,
there
is
little
other
grain
than
oats
and
barley
;
the
first
are
much
better
,
the
last
much
worse
,
than
those
of
the
same
species
in
England
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
there
is
so
little
rye
,
which
is
a
grain
that
will
thrive
in
almost
any
soil
,
and
it
is
still
more
surprising
,
that
the
cultivation
of
potatoes
should
be
so
much
neglected
in
the
Highlands
,
where
the
poor
people
have
not
meal
enough
to
supply
them
with
bread
through
the
winter
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
river
are
the
towns
of
Paisley
and
Rensrew
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
from
an
inconsiderable
village
,
is
become
one
of
the
most
flourishing
places
of
the
kingdom
,
enriched
by
the
linen
,
cambrick
,
flowered
lawn
,
and
silk
manufactures
.
<EOS>
It
was
formerly
noted
for
a
rich
monastery
of
the
monks
of
Clugney
,
who
wrote
the
famous
Scoti
-
Chronicon
called
The
Black
Book
of
Paisley
.
<EOS>
The
old
abbey
still
remains
,
converted
into
a
dwelling
-
house
,
belonging
to
the
carl
of
Dundonald
.
<EOS>
Renfrew
is
a
pretty
town
,
on
the
banks
of
the
Clyde
,
capital
of
the
shire
,
which
was
heretofore
the
patrimony
of
the
Stuart
family
,
and
gave
the
title
of
baron
to
the
king
's
eldest
son
,
which
is
still
assumed
by
the
prince
of
Wales
.
    
<EOS>
The
Clyde
we
left
a
little
on
our
left
-
hand
at
Dumbritton
,
where
it
widens
into
an
aestuary
or
frith
,
being
augmented
by
the
influx
of
the
Leven
.
<EOS>
On
this
spot
stands
the
castle
formerly
called
Alcluyd
,
washed
by
these
two
rivers
on
all
sides
,
except
a
narrow
isthmus
,
which
at
every
spring
-
tide
is
overflowed
.
<EOS>
The
whole
is
a
great
curiosity
,
from
the
quality
and
form
of
the
rock
,
as
well
as
from
the
nature
of
its
situation
.
  
<EOS>
We
now
crossed
the
water
of
Leven
,
which
,
though
nothing
near
so
considerable
as
the
Clyde
,
is
much
more
transparent
,
pastoral
,
and
delightful
.
<EOS>
This
charming
stream
is
the
outlet
of
Lough
-
Lomond
,
and
through
a
tract
of
four
miles
pursues
its
winding
course
,
murmuring
over
a
bed
of
pebbles
,
till
it
joins
the
Frith
at
Dumbritton
.
<EOS>
A
very
little
above
its
source
,
on
the
lake
,
stands
the
house
of
Cameron
,
belonging
to
Mr
Smollett
,
so
embosomed
in
an
oak
wood
,
that
we
did
not
see
it
till
we
were
within
fifty
yards
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
the
Lago
di
Garda
,
Albano
,
De
Vico
,
Bolsena
,
and
Geneva
,
and
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
prefer
Lough
-
Lomond
to
them
all
;
a
preference
which
is
certainly
owing
to
the
verdant
islands
that
seem
to
float
upon
its
surface
,
affording
the
most
inchanting
objects
of
repose
to
the
excursive
view
.
<EOS>
Nor
are
the
banks
destitute
of
beauties
,
which
even
partake
of
the
sublime
.
<EOS>
On
this
side
they
display
a
sweet
variety
of
woodland
,
corn
-
field
,
and
pasture
,
with
several
agreeable
villas
emerging
as
it
were
out
of
the
lake
,
till
,
at
some
distance
,
the
prospect
terminates
in
huge
mountains
covered
with
heath
,
which
being
in
the
bloom
,
affords
a
very
rich
covering
of
purple
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
here
is
romantic
beyond
imagination
.
<EOS>
This
country
is
justly
stiled
the
Arcadia
of
Scotland
;
and
I
do
n't
doubt
<EOS>
but
it
may
vie
with
Arcadia
in
every
thing
but
climate

<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
excels
it
in
verdure

wood

What

seven

and
in
many
above
a

having
four

twenty
habitable

some

finally

communicating

by
sending
off

It

There

an

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
IF
I
was
disposed
to
be
critical
,
I
should
say
this
house
of
Cameron
is
too
near
the
lake
,
which
approaches
,
on
one
side
,
to
within
six
or
seven
yards
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
placed
in
a
higher
site
,
which
would
have
afforded
a
more
extensive
prospect
and
a
drier
atmosphere
;
but
this
imperfection
is
not
chargeable
on
the
present
proprietor
,
who
purchased
it
ready
built
,
rather
than
be
at
the
trouble
of
repairing
his
own
family
-
house
of
Bonhill
,
which
stands
two
miles
from
hence
on
the
Leven
,
so
surrounded
with
plantation
,
that
it
used
to
be
known
by
the
name
of
the
Mavis
(
or
thrush
)
<EOS>
Nest
.
<EOS>
Above
that
house
is
a
romantic
glen
or
clift
of
a
mountain
,
covered
with
hanging
woods
having
at
bottom
a
stream
of
fine
water
that
forms
a
number
of
cascades
in
its
descent
to
join
the
Leven
,
so
that
the
scene
is
quite
enchanting
.
<EOS>
A
captain
of
a
man
of
war
,
who
had
made
the
circuit
of
the
globe
with
Mr
Anson
,
being
conducted
to
this
glen
,
exclaimed
,
"
Juan
Fernandez
,
by
God
!
"
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
this
country
would
be
a
perfect
paradise
,
if
it
was
not
,
like
Wales
,
cursed
with
a
weeeping
climate
,
owing
to
the
same
causes
in
both
,
the
neighbourhood
of
high
mountains
,
and
a
westerly
situation
,
exposed
to
the
vapours
of
the
Atlantic
ocean
.
<EOS>
This
air
,
however
,
notwithstanding
its
humidity
,
is
so
healthy
,
that
the
natives
are
scarce
ever
visited
by
any
other
disease
than
the
small
-
pox
,
and
certain
cutaneous
evils
,
which
are
the
effects
of
dirty
living
,
the
great
and
general
reproach
of
the
commonalty
of
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Here
are
a
great
many
living
monuments
of
longaevity
;
and
among
the
rest
a
person
,
whom
I
treat
with
singular
respect
,
as
a
venerable
druid
,
who
has
lived
near
ninety
years
,
without
pain
or
sickness
,
among
oaks
of
his
own
planting
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
once
proprietor
of
these
lands
:
but
being
of
a
projecting
spirit
,
some
of
his
schemes
miscarried
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
part
with
his
possession
,
which
hath
shifted
hands
two
or
three
times
since
that
period
;
but
every
succeeding
proprietor
hath
done
every
thing
in
his
power
,
to
make
his
old
age
easy
and
comfortable
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
sufficiency
to
procure
the
necessaries
of
life
;
and
he
and
his
old
woman
resided
in
a
small
convenient
farm
-
house
,
having
a
little
garden
which
he
cultivates
with
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
This
ancient
couple
live
in
great
health

Mr
Smollett
calls
him
the
admiral
,
because
he
insists
upon
steering
his
pleasure
-
boat
upon
the
lake
;
and
he
spends
most
of
his
time
in
ranging
through
the
woods
,
which
he
declares
he
enjoys
as
much
as
if
they
were
still
his
own
property
  
<EOS>
I
asked
him
the
other
day
,
if
he
was
never
sick
,
and
he
answered
,
Yes
;
he
had
a
slight
fever
the
year
before
the
union
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
not
deaf
,
I
should
take
much
pleasure
in
his
conversation
;
for
he
is
very
intelligent
and
his
memory
is
surprisingly
retensive
  
<EOS>
These
are
the
happy
effects
of
temperance
,
exercise
,
and
good
nature
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
his
innocence
,
however
,
he
was
the
cause
of
great
perturbation
to
my
man
Clinker
,
whose
natural
superstition
has
been
much
injured
,
by
the
histories
of
witches
,
fairies
,
ghosts
,
and
goblins
,
which
he
has
heard
in
this
country
  
<EOS>
On
the
evening
after
our
arrival
,
Humphry
strolled
into
the
Wood
,
in
the
course
of
his
meditation
,
and
all
at
once
the
admiral
stood
before
him
,
under
the
shadow
of
a
spreading
oak
.
<EOS>
Through
the
fellow
is
far
from
being
timorous
in
cases
that
are
not
supposed
preternatural
,
he
could
not
stand
the
sight
of
this
apparition
,
but
ran
into
the
kitchen
,
with
his
hair
standing
on
end
,
staring
wildly
,
and
deprived
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Jenkins
,
seeing
him
in
this
condition
,
screamed
aloud
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
,
he
has
seen
something
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
was
alarmed
,
and
the
whole
house
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
recruited
with
a
dram
,
I
desired
him
to
explain
the
meaning
of
all
this
agitation
;
and
,
with
some
reluctance
,
he
owned
he
had
seen
a
spirit
,
in
the
shape
of
an
old
man
with
a
white
beard
,
a
black
cap
,
and
a
plaid
night
gown
.
<EOS>
He
was
undeceived
by
the
admiral
in
person
,
who
coming
in
at
this
juncture
,
appeared
to
be
a
creature
of
real
flesh
and
blood
.
    
<EOS>
Do
you
know
how
we
fare
in
this
Scottish
paradise
?
<EOS>
We
make
free
with
our
landlord
's
mutton
,
which
is
excellent
,
his
poultry
-
yard
,
his
garden
,
his
dairy
,
and
his
cellar
,
which
are
all
well
stored
.
<EOS>
We
have
delicious
salmon
,
pike
,
trout
,
perch
,
par
,
&
c.
at
the
door
,
for
the
taking
.
<EOS>
The
Frith
of
Clyde
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
hill
,
supplies
us
with
mullet
,
red
and
grey
,
cod
,
mackarel
,
whiting
,
and
a
variety
of
sea
fish
,
including
the
finest
fresh
herrings
I
ever
tasted
.
<EOS>
We
have
sweet
,
juicy
beef
,
and
tolerable
veal
,
with
delicate
bread
from
the
little
town
of
Dumbritton
;
and
plenty
of
partridge
,
growse
,
heath
-
cock
,
and
other
game
in
presents
.
    
<EOS>
We
have
been
visited
by
all
the
gentlemen
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
have
entertained
us
at
their
houses
,
not
barely
with
hospitality
,
but
with
such
marks
of
cordial
affection
,
as
one
would
wish
to
find
among
near
relations
,
after
an
absence
of
many
years
.
    
<EOS>
I
told
you
,
in
my
last
,
I
had
projected
an
excursion
to
the
Highlands
,
which
project
I
have
now
happily
executed
,
under
the
auspices
of
Sir
George
Colquhoun
,
a
colonel
in
the
Dutch
service
,
who
offered
himself
as
our
conductor
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
Leaving
our
women
at
Cameron
,
to
the
care
and
inspection
of
Lady
H
#
#

#
C
#

#

,
we
set
out
on
horseback
for
Inverary
,
the
county
town
of
Argyle
,
and
dined
on
the
road
with
the
Laird
of
Macfarlane
,
the
greatest
genealogist
I
ever
knew
in
any
country
,
and
perfectly
acquainted
with
all
the
antiquities
of
Scotland
.
    
<EOS>
The
duke
of
Argyle
has
an
old
castle
at
Inverary
,
where
he
resides
when
he
is
in
Scotland
;
and
hard
by
is
the
shell
of
a
noble
Gothic
palace
,
built
by
the
last
duke
,
which
,
when
finished
,
will
be
a
great
ornament
to
this
part
of
the
Highlands
.
<EOS>
As
for
Inverary
,
it
is
a
place
of
very
little
importance
.
<EOS>
This
country
is
amazingly
wild
,
especially
towards
the
mountains
,
which
are
heaped
upon
the
backs
of
one
another
,
making
a
most
stupendous
appearance
of
savage
nature
,
with
hardly
any
signs
of
cultivation
,
or
even
of
population
.
<EOS>
All
is
sublimity
,
silence
and
solitude
.
<EOS>
The
people
live
together
in
glens
or
bottoms
,
where
they
are
sheltered
from
the
cold
and
storms
of
winter
:
but
there
is
a
margin
of
plain
ground
spread
along
the
sea
side
,
which
is
well
inhabited
and
improved
by
the
arts
of
husbandry
;
and
this
I
take
to
be
one
of
the
most
agreeable
tracts
of
the
whole
island
;
the
sea
not
only
keeps
it
warm
,
and
suplies
it
with
fish
,
but
affords
one
of
the
most
ravishing
prospects
in
the
whole
world
;
I
mean
the
appearance
of
the
Hebrides
,
or
Western
Islands
,
to
the
number
of
three
hundred
,
scattered
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
,
in
the
most
agreeable
confusion
.
<EOS>
As
the
soil
and
climate
of
the
Highlands
are
but
ill
adapted
to
the
cultivation
of
corn
,
the
people
apply
themselves
chiefly
to
the
breeding
and
feeding
of
black
cattle
,
which
turn
to
good
account
,
Those
animals
run
wild
all
the
winter
,
without
any
shelter
or
subsistance
,
but
what
they
can
find
among
the
heath
.
<EOS>
When
the
snow
lies
so
deep
and
hard
,
that
they
can
not
penetrate
to
the
roots
of
the
grass
,
they
make
a
diurnal
progress
,
guided
by
a
sure
instinct
,
to
the
sea
-
side
at
low
water
,
where
they
feed
on
the
alga
marina
,
and
other
plants
that
grow
upon
the
beach
.
    
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
branch
of
husbandry
,
which
requires
very
little
attendance
and
labour
,
is
one
of
the
principal
causes
of
that
idleness
and
want
of
industry
,
which
distinguishes
these
mountaineers
in
their
own
country
  
When
they
come
forth
into
the
world
they
become
a
diligent
and
alert
as
any
people
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
They
are
undoubtedly
a
very
distinct
-
species
from
their
fellow
-
subjects
of
the
Lowlands
,
against
whom
they
indulge
an
ancient
spirit
of
animosity
;
and
this
difference
is
very
discernible
even
among
persons
of
family
and
education
.
<EOS>
The
Lowlanders
are
generally
cool
and
circumspect
,
the
Highlanders
fiery
and
ferocious
:
but
this
violence
of
their
passions
serves
only
to
inflame
the
zeal
of
their
devotion
to
strangers
,
which
is
truly
enthusiastic
.
    
<EOS>
We
proceeded
about
twenty
miles
beyond
Inverary
,
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
,
a
friend
of
our
conductor
,
where
we
stayed
a
few
days
,
and
were
feasted
in
such
a
manner
,
that
I
began
to
dread
the
consequence
to
my
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
solitude
that
prevails
among
these
mountains
,
there
is
no
want
of
people
in
the
Highlands
,
I
am
credibly
informed
that
the
duke
of
Argyle
can
assemble
five
thousand
men
in
arms
,
of
his
own
clan
and
surname
,
which
is
Campbell
;
and
there
is
besides
a
tribe
of
the
same
appellations
,
whose
chief
is
the
Earl
of
Breadalbine
.
<EOS>
The
Macdonalds
are
as
numerous
,
and
remarkably
warlike
:
<EOS>
the
Camerons
,
M'Leods
,
Frasers
,
Grants
,
M'Kenzies
,
M'Kays
,
M'Phersons
,
M'Intoshes
,
are
powerful
clans
;
so
that
if
all
the
Highlanders
,
including
the
inhabitants
of
the
Isles
,
were
united
,
they
could
bring
into
the
field
an
army
of
forty
thousand
fighting
men
,
capable
of
undertaking
the
most
dangerous
enterprize
.
<EOS>
We
have
lived
to
see
four
thousand
of
them
,
without
discipline
,
throw
the
whole
kingdom
of
Great
Britain
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
They
attacked
and
defeated
two
armies
of
regular
troops
,
accustomed
to
service
.
<EOS>
They
penetrated
into
the
centre
of
England
;
and
afterwards
marched
back
with
deliberation
,
in
the
face
of
two
other
armies
,
through
an
enemy
's
country
,
where
every
precaution
was
taken
to
cut
off
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
any
other
people
in
Europe
,
who
,
without
the
use
or
knowledge
of
arms
,
will
attack
regular
forces
sword
in
hand
,
if
their
chief
will
head
them
in
battle
.
<EOS>
When
disciplined
,
they
can
not
fail
of
being
excellent
soldiers
.
<EOS>
They
do
not
walk
like
the
generality
of
mankind
,
but
trot
and
bounce
like
deer
,
as
if
they
moved
upon
springs
.
<EOS>
They
greatly
excel
the
Lowlanders
in
all
the
exercises
that
require
agility
;
the
are
incredibly
abstemious
,
and
patient
of
hunger
and
fatigue
;
so
steeled
against
the
weather
,
that
in
travelling
,
even
when
the
ground
is
covered
with
snow
,
they
never
look
for
a
house
,
or
any
other
shelter
but
their
plaid
,
in
which
they
wrap
themselves
up
,
and
go
to
sleep
under
the
cope
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
Such
people
,
in
quality
of
soldiers
,
must
be
invincible
,
when
the
business
is
to
perform
quick
marches
in
a
difficult
country
,
to
strike
sudden
strokes
,
beat
up
the
enemy
's
quarters
,
harass
their
cavalry
,
and
perform
expeditions
without
the
formality
of
magazines
,
baggage
,
forage
,
and
artillery
.
<EOS>
The
chieftainship
of
the
Higlanders
is
a
very
dangerous
influence
operating
at
the
extremity
of
the
island
,
where
the
eyes
and
hands
of
government
can
not
be
supposed
to
see
and
act
with
precision
and
vigour
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
break
the
force
of
clanship
,
administration
has
always
practised
the
political
maxim
,
Divide
et
impera
.
<EOS>
The
legislature
hath
not
only
disarmed
these
mountaineers
,
but
also
deprived
them
of
their
ancient
garb
,
which
contributed
in
a
great
measure
to
keep
up
their
military
spirit
;
and
their
slavish
tenures
are
dissolved
by
act
of
parliament
;
so
that
they
are
at
present
as
free
and
independent
of
their
chiefs
,
as
the
law
can
make
them
:
but
the
original
attachment
still
remains
,
and
is
founded
on
something
prior
to
the
feudal
system
,
about
which
the
writers
of
this
age
have
made
such
a
pother
,
as
if
it
was
a
new
discovery
,
like
the
Copernican
system
.
<EOS>
:
Every
peculiarity
of
policy
,
custom
,
and
even
temperament
,
is
affectedly
traced
to
this
origin
,
as
if
the
feudal
constitution
had
not
been
common
to
almost
all
the
natives
of
Europe
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
expect
to
see
the
use
of
trunk
-
hose
and
buttered
ale
ascribed
to
the
influence
of
the
feudal
system
.
<EOS>
The
connection
between
the
clans
and
their
chiefs
is
,
without
all
doubt
,
patriarchal
.
<EOS>
It
is
founded
on
hereditary
regard
and
affection
,
cherished
through
a
long
succession
of
ages
.
<EOS>
The
clan
consider
the
chief
as
their
father
,
they
bear
his
name
,
they
believe
themselves
descended
from
his
family
,
and
they
obeyed
him
as
their
lord
,
with
all
the
ardour
of
filial
love
and
veneration
;
while
he
,
on
his
part
,
exerts
a
paternal
authority
,
commanding
,
chastising
,
rewarding
,
protecting
,
and
maintaining
them
as
his
own
children
.
<EOS>
If
the
legislature
would
entirely
destroy
this
connection
,
it
must
compel
the
Highlanders
to
change
their
habitation
and
their
names
.
<EOS>
Even
this
experiment
has
been
formerly
tried
without
success
  
<EOS>
In
the
reign
of
James
VI
a
battle
was
fought
within
a
few
short
miles
of
this
place
,
between
two
clans
,
the
M'Gregors
and
the
Colquhouns
,
in
which
the
latter
were
defeated
:
the
Laird
of
M'Gregor
made
such
a
barbarous
use
of
his
victory
,
that
he
was
forfeited
and
outlawed
by
act
of
parliament
:
his
lands
were
given
to
the
family
of
Montrose
,
and
his
clan
were
obliged
to
change
their
name
.
<EOS>
The
obeyed
so
far
,
as
to
call
themselves
severally
Campbell
,
Graham
,
or
Drummond
,
the
surnames
of
the
families
of
Argyle
,
Montrose
,
and
Perth
,
that
they
might
enjoy
the
protection
of
those
houses
;
but
they
still
added
M'Gregor
to
their
new
appellation
;
and
as
their
chief
was
deprived
of
his
estate
,
they
robbed
and
plundered
for
his
subsistence
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Cameron
of
Lochiel
,
the
chief
of
that
clan
,
whose
father
was
attainted
for
having
been
concerned
in
the
last
rebellion
,
returning
from
France
in
obedience
to
a
proclamation
and
act
of
parliament
,
passed
at
the
beginning
of
the
late
war
,
payed
a
visit
to
his
own
country
,
and
hired
a
farm
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
father
's
house
,
which
had
been
burnt
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
clan
,
though
ruined
and
scattered
,
no
sooner
heard
of
his
arrival
than
they
stocked
to
him
from
all
quarters
,
to
welcome
his
return
,
and
in
a
few
days
stocked
his
farm
with
seven
hundred
black
cattle
,
which
they
had
saved
in
the
general
wreck
of
their
affairs
:
but
their
beloved
chief
,
who
was
a
promising
youth
,
did
not
live
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
their
fidelity
and
attachment
.
    
<EOS>
The
most
effectual
method
<EOS>
I
know
to
weaken
,
and
at
length
destroy
this
influence
,
is
to
employ
the
commonalty
in
such
a
manner
to
give
them
a
taste
of
property
and
independence
  
<EOS>
In
vain
the
government
grants
them
advantageous
leases
on
the
forfeited
estates
,
if
they
have
no
property
to
prosecute
the
means
of
improvement
  
<EOS>
The
sea
is
an
exhaustible
fund
of
riches
;
but
the
fishery
can
not
be
carried
on
without
vessels
,
casks
,
salt
,
lines
,
nets
,
and
other
tackle

<EOS>
I
conversed
with
a
sensible
man
of
this
country
,
who
,
from
a
real
spirit
of
patriotism
,
had
set
up
a
fishery
on
the
coast
,
and
a
manufacture
of
coarse
linen
,
for
the
employment
of
the
poor
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
Cod
is
here
in
such
plenty
,
that
he
told
me
he
had
seen
seven
hundred
taken
on
one
line
,
at
one
hawl
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
observed
,
however
,
that
the
line
was
of
immense
length
,
and
had
two
thousand
hooks
,
baited
with
muscles
;
but
the
fish
was
so
superior
to
the
cod
caught
on
the
banks
of
Newfoundland
,
that
his
corespondent
at
Lisbon
sold
them
immediately
at
his
own
price
,
although
Lent
was
just
over
when
they
arrived
,
and
the
people
might
be
supposed
quite
cloyed
with
this
kind
of
diet

manufacture
was
likewise
in
a
prosperous
way
,
when
the
late
war
intervening
,
all
his
best
hands
were
pressed
into
the
service
.
    
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
expected
,
that
the
gentlemen
of
this
country
should
execute
commercial
schemes
to
render
their
vassals
independent
;
nor
,
indeed
,
are
such
schemes
suited
to
their
way
of
life
and
inclination
;
but
a
company
of
merchants
might
,
with
proper
management
,
turn
to
good
account
a
fishery
established
in
this
part
of
Scotland
  
<EOS>
Our
people
have
a
strange
itch
to
colonize
America
,
when
the
uncultivated
parts
of
our
own
island
might
be
settled
to
greater
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
rambled
through
the
mountains
and
glens
of
Argyle
,
we
visited
the
adjacent
islands
of
Ila
,
Jura
,
Mull
,
and
Icolmkill
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
,
we
saw
the
remains
of
a
castle
,
built
in
a
lake
,
where
Macdonald
,
lord
or
king
of
the
isles
,
formerly
resided
.
<EOS>
Jura
is
famous
for
having
given
birth
to
one
Mackcrain
,
who
lived
one
hundred
and
eighty
years
in
one
house
,
and
died
in
the
reign
of
Charles
the
Second
.
<EOS>
Mull
affords
several
bays
,
where
there
is
safe
anchorage
<EOS>
;
in
one
of
which
,
the
Florida
,
a
ship
of
the
Spanish
armada
,
was
blown
up
by
one
of
Mr
Smollett
's
ancestors
  
About
forty
years
ago
,
John
duke
of
Argyle
is
said
to
have
consulted
the
Spanish
registers
,
by
which
it
appeared
,
that
this
ship
had
the
military
chest
on
board
  
<EOS>
He
employed
experienced
divers
to
examine
the
wreck
;
and
they
found
the
hull
of
the
vessel
still
entire
,
but
so
covered
with
sand
,
that
they
could
not
make
their
way
between
decks
;
however
,
they
picked
up
several
pieces
of
plate
,
that
were
scattered
about
in
the
bay
,
and
a
couple
of
fine
brass
cannon
.
    
<EOS>
I
colmkill
,
or
Iona
,
is
a
small
island
which
St.
Columba
chose
for
his
habitation
  
<EOS>
It
was
respected
for
its
sanctity
,
and
college
or
seminary
of
ecclesiastics
  
Part
of
its
church
is
still
standing
,
with
the
tombs
of
several
Scottish
,
Irish
,
and
Danish
sovereigns
,
who
were
here
intered
  
<EOS>
These
islanders
are
very
bold
and
dexterous
watermen
,
consequently
the
better
adapted
to
the
fishery
:
in
their
manners
they
are
less
savage
and
impetuous
than
their
countrymen
on
the
continent
;
and
they
speak
the
Erse
or
Gaelick
in
its
greatest
purity
.
    
<EOS>
Having
sent
round
our
Horses
by
land
,
we
embarked
in
the
district
of
Cowal
,
for
Greenock
,
which
is
a
neat
little
town
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
Frith
,
with
a
curious
harbour
,
formed
by
three
stone
jetties
,
carried
out
a
good
way
into
the
sea
  
Newport
-
Glasgow
<EOS>
is
such
another
place
,
about
two
miles
higher
up
  
<EOS>
Both
have
a
face
of
business
and
plenty
,
and
are
supported
entirely
by
the
shipping
of
Glasgow
,
of
which
I
counted
sixty
large
vessels
in
these
harbours
  
Taking
boat
again
at
Newport
,
we
were
in
less
than
an
hour
landed
on
the
other
side
,
within
two
short
miles
of
our
head
-
quarters
,
where
we
found
our
women
in
good
health
and
spirits
  
<EOS>
They
had
been
two
days
before
joined
by
Mr
Smollett
and
his
lady
,
to
whom
we
have
such
obligations
as
I
can
not
mention
,
even
to
you
,
without
blushing
.
    
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
we
shall
bid
adieu
to
the
Scotch
Arcadia
,
and
begin
our
progress
to
the
southward
,
taking
our
way
by
Lanerk
and
Nithsdale
,
to
the
west
borders
of
England
.
<EOS>
I
have
received
so
much
advantage
and
satisfaction
from
this
tour
,
that
if
my
health
suffers
no
revolution
in
the
winter
,
I
believe
I
shall
be
tempted
to
undertake
another
expedition
to
the
Northern
extremity
of
Caithness
,
unencumbered
by
those
impediments
which
now
clog

MY
DEAREST
LETTY
<EOS>
,
NEVER
did
poor
prisoner
long
for
deliverance
,
more
than
I
have
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
disburden
my
cares
into
your
friendly
bosom
;
and
the
occasion
which
now
presents
itself
,
is
little
less
than
miraculous

Honest
Saunders
Macawly
,
the
travelling
Scotchman
,
who
goes
every
year
to
Wales
,
is
now
at
Glasgow
,
buying
goods
,
and
coming
to
pay
his
respects
to
our
family
;
has
undertaken
to
deliver
this
letter
into
your
own
hand
   
<EOS>
We
have
been
six
weeks
in
Scotland
,
and
seen
the
principal
towns
of
the
kingdom
,
where
we
have
been
treated
with
great
civility
  
<EOS>
The
people
are
very
courteous
;
and
the
country
being
exceedingly
romantic
,
suits
my
turn
and
inclinations
  
<EOS>
I
contracted
some
friendships
at
Edinburgh
,
which
is
a
large
and
lofty
city
,
full
of
gay
company
;
and
,
in
particular
,
commenced
an
intimate
correspondence
with
one
miss
R####t####n
,
an
amiable
young
lady
of
my
own
age
,
whose
charms
seemed
to
soften
,
and
even
to
subdue
the
stubborn
heart
of
my
brother
Jery
;
but
he
no
sooner
left
the
place
than
he
relapsed
into
his
former
insensibility
  
<EOS>
I
feel
,
however
,
that
this
indifference
is
not
the
family
-
constitution
  
I
never
admitted
but
one
idea
of
love
,
and
that
has
taken
such
root
in
my
heart
,
as
to
be
equally
proof
against
all
the
pulls
of
discretion
,
and
the
frests
of
neglect
.
    
<EOS>
Dear
Letty
!
<EOS>
I
had
an
alarming
adventure
at
the
hunters
ball
in
Edinburgh
  
<EOS>
While
I
sat
discoursing
with
a
friend
in
a
corner
,
all
at
once
the
very
image
of
Wilson
stood
before
me
,
dressed
exactly
as
he
was
in
the
character
of
Aimwell
!
<EOS>
It
was
one
Mr
Gordon
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
before
  
Shocked
at
the
sudden
apparition
,
I
fainted
away
,
and
threw
the
whole
assembly
in
confusion
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
cause
of
my
disorder
remained
a
secret
to
every
body
but
my
brother
,
who
was
likewise
struck
with
the
resemblance
,
and
scolded
after
we
came
home
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
sensible
of
Jery
's
affection
,
and
know
he
spoke
as
well
with
a
view
to
my
own
interest
and
happiness
,
as
in
regard
to
the
honour
of
the
family
;
but
I
can
not
bear
to
have
my
wounds
probed
severely
  
<EOS>
I
was
not
so
much
affected
by
the
censure
he
passed
upon
my
own
indiscretion
,
as
with
the
reflection
he
made
on
the
conduct
of
Wilson
  
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
if
he
was
really
the
gentleman
he
pretended
to
be
,
and
harboured
nothing
but
honourable
designs
,
he
would
have
vindicated
his
pretensions
in
the
face
of
day
  
<EOS>
This
remark
made
a
deep
impression
upon
my
mind
  
I
endeavoured
to
conceal
my
thoughts
;
and
this
endeavour
had
a
bad
effect
upon
my
health
and
spirits
;
so
it
was
thought
necessary
that
I
should
go
to
the
Highlands
,
and
drink
the
goat
-
milk
-
whey
.
    
<EOS>
We
went
accordingly
to
Lough
-
Lomond
,
one
of
the
most
enchanting
spots
in
the
whole
world
;
and
what
with
this
remedy
,
which
I
had
every
morning
fresh
from
the
mountains
,
and
the
pure
air
,
and
chearful
company
,
I
have
recovered
my
flesh
and
appetite
;
though
there
is
something
still
at
bottom
,
which
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
air
,
exercise
,
company
,
or
medicine
to
remove
  
These
incidents
would
not
touch
me
so
nearly
,
if
I
had
a
sensible
confidant
to
sympathize
with
my
affliction
,
and
comfort
me
with
wholesome
advice
  
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
of
this
kind
,
except
Win
.
<EOS>
Jenkins
,
who
is
really
a
good
body
in
the
main
,
but
very
ill
qualified
for
such
an
office
  
<EOS>
The
poor
creature
is
weak
in
her
nerves
,
as
well
as
in
her
understanding
;
otherwise
I
might
have
known
the
true
name
and
character
of
that
unfortunate
youth
  
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
call
him
unfortunate
?
<EOS>
perhaps
the
epithet
is
more
applicable
to
me
for
having
listened
to
the
false
professions
of
  
But
,
hold
!
<EOS>
I
have
as
yet
no
right
,
and
sure
I
have
no
inclination
to
believe
any
thing
to
the
prejudice
of
his
honour
  
<EOS>
In
that
reflection
I
shall
still
exert
my
patience
  
<EOS>
As
for
Mrs
Jenkins
,
she
herself
is
really
an
object
of
compassion
  
Between
vanity
,
methodism
,
and
love
,
her
head
,
is
almost
turned
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
more
regard
for
her
however
,
if
she
had
been
more
constant
in
the
object
of
her
affection
;
but
,
truly
,
she
aimed
at
conquest
,
and
flirted
at
the
same
time
with
my
uncle
's
footman
,
Humphry
Clinker
,
who
is
really
a
deserving
young
man
,
and
one
Dutton
,
my
brother
's
valet
de
chambre
,
a
debauched
fellow
;
who
,
leaving
Win
.
<EOS>
in
the
lurch
,
ran
away
with
another
man
's
bride
at
Berwick
.
    
<EOS>
My
dear
Willis
,
I
am
am
truly
ashamed
of
my
own
sex
  
<EOS>
We
complain
of
advantages
which
the
men
take
of
our
youth
,
inexperience
,
sensibility
,
and
all
that
;
but
I
have
seen
enough
to
believe
,
that
our
sex
in
general
make
it
their
business
to
ensnare
the
other
;
and
for
this
purpose
,
employ
arts
which
are
by
no
means
to
be
justified
  
<EOS>
In
point
of
constancy
,
they
certainly
have
nothing
to
reproach
the
male
part
of
the
creation
  
<EOS>
My
poor
aunt
,
without
any
regard
to
her
years
and
imperfections
,
has
gone
to
market
with
her
charms
in
every
place
where
she
thought
she
had
the
least
chance
to
dispose
of
her
person
,
which
,
however
,
hangs
still
heavy
on
her
hands
  
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
she
has
used
even
religion
as
a
decoy
,
though
it
has
not
answered
her
expectation
  
<EOS>
She
has
been
praying
,
preaching
,
and
catechising
among
the
methodists
,
with
whom
this
country
abounds
;
and
pretends
to
have
such
manifestations
and
revelations
,
as
even
Clinker
himself
can
hardly
believe
,
though
the
poor
fellow
is
half
crazy
with
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
As
for
Jenkins
,
she
affects
to
take
all
her
mistress
's
reveries
for
gospel
  
<EOS>
She
has
also
her
heart
-
heavings
and
motions
of
the
spirit
;
and
God
forgive
me
if
I
think
uncharitably
,
but
all
this
seems
to
me
to
be
down
-
right
hypocrisy
and
deceit
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
the
poor
girl
imposes
on
herself
  
<EOS>
She
is
generally
in
a
flutter
,
and
is
much
subject
to
vapours
  
<EOS>
Since
we
came
to
Scotland
,
she
has
seen
apparitions
,
and
pretends
to
prophesy
  
<EOS>
If
I
could
put
faith
in
all
these
supernatural
visitations
,
I
should
think
myself
abandoned
of
grace
;
for
I
have
neither
seen
,
heard
,
nor
felt
any
thing
of
this
nature
,
although
I
endeavour
to
discharge
the
duties
of
religion
with
all
the
sincerity
,
zeal
,
and
devotion
,
that
is
in
the
power
of
,

DEAR
MARY
,
SAUNDERS
MACULLY
,
the
Scotchman
who
pushes
directly
for
Vails
,
has
promised
to
give
it
you
into
your
own
hand
,
and
therefore
I
would
not
miss
the
opportunity
to
let
you
now
as
I
am
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
;
and
yet
I
have
been
on
the
brink
of
the
other
world
since
I
sent
you
my
last
letter
.
  
<EOS>
We
went
by
sea
to
another
kingdom
called
Fife
,
and
coming
back
,
had
like
to
have
gone
to
pot
in
a
storm
.
  
<EOS>
What
between
the
frite
and
sickness
,
I
thought
I
should
have
brought
my
heart
up
;
even
Mr
Clinker
was
not
his
own
man
for
eight
and
forty
hours
,
after
we
got
ashore
  
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
some
folks
that
we
scaped
drounding
;
for
mistress
was
very
frexious
,
and
seemed
but
indifferently
prepared
for
a
change
;
but
,
thank
God
,
she
was
soon
put
in
a
better
frame
by
the
private
exaltations
of
the
reverend
Mr
Macrcodile
.
  
<EOS>
We
afterwards
churned
to
Starling
and
Grascow
,
which
are
a
kiple
of
handsome
towns
;
and
then
we
went
to
a
gentleman
's
house
at
Loff
-
Loming
,
which
is
a
wonderful
sea
of
fresh
water
,
with
a
power
of
hylands
in
the
midst
<EOS>
on't
  
<EOS>
They
say
as
how
it
has
got
ne'er
a
bottom
,
and
was
made
by
a
musician
;
and
,
truly
,
I
believe
it
;
for
it
is
not
in
the
course
of
nature
.
  
<EOS>
It
has
got
waves
without
wind
,
fish
without
sins
,
and
a
floating
byland
;
and
one
of
them
is
a
crutchyard
,
where
the
dead
are
buried
;
and
always
before
the
person
dies
,
a
bell
rings
of
itself
to
give
warning
.
    
<EOS>
O
Mary
!
<EOS>
this
is
the
land
of
congyration
  
<EOS>
The
bell
knolled
when
we
were
there
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
lights
,
and
heard
lamentations
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
,
our
landlord
,
has
got
another
house
,
which
he
was
fain
to
quit
,
<EOS>
on
account
of
a
mischievous
ghost
,
that
would
not
suffer
people
to
lie
in
their
beds
.
  
<EOS>
The
fairies
dwell
in
a
hole
of
Kairmann
,
a
mounting
hard
by

and
they
steal
away
the
good
women
that
are
in
the
straw
,
if
so
be
as
how
there
a'n't
<EOS>
a
horshoe
nailed
to
the
door
:
and
I
was
shewn
an
ould
vitch
,
called
Elspath
Ringavey
,
with
a
red
petticoat
,
bleared
eyes
,
and
a
mould
of
grey
bristles
on
her
sin
.
  
<EOS>
That
she
mought
do
me
no
harm
,
I
crossed
her
hand
with
a
taster
,
and
bid
her
tell
my
fortune
;
and
she
told
me
such
things
  
descriving
Mr
Clinker
to
a
hair
 
<EOS>
but
it
shall
ne'er
be
said
,
that
I
menchioned
a
word
of
the
matter
.
  
<EOS>
As
I
was
troubled
with
sits
,
the
advised
me
to
bathe
in
the
toss
,
which
was
holy
water
;
and
<EOS>
so
I
went
in
the
morning
to
a
private
place
along
with
the
house
-
maid
,
and
we
bathed
in
our
birth
-
day
soot
,
after
the
fashion
of
the
country
;
and
behold
,
whilst
we
dabbled
in
the
loff
,
sir
George
Coon
started
up
with
a
gun
;
but
we
clapt
our
hands
to
our
faces
,
and
passed
by
him
to
the
place
where
we
had
left
our
smocks
  
<EOS>
A
civil
gentleman
would
have
turned
his
head
another
way
.
  
<EOS>
My
comfit
is
,
he
new
not
which
was
which
,
and
,
as
the
saying
is
,
all
cats
in
the
dark
are
grey
.
  
<EOS>
Whilst
we
stayed
at
Loff
-
Loming
,
he
and
our
two
squires
went
three
or
four
days
churning
among
the
wild
men
of
the
mountings
;
a
parcel
of
felvidges
that
lie
in
caves
among
the
rocks
,
devour
young
children
,
speak
Velch
,
but
the
vords
are
different
.
<EOS>
Our
ladies
would
not
part
with
Mr
Clinker
,
because
he
is
so
stout
,
and
so
pyehouse
,
that
he
fears
neither
man
nor
devils
,
if
so
be
as
they
do
n't
take
him
by
surprise
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
was
once
so
flurried
by
an
operition
,
that
he
had
like
to
have
founded
.
  
<EOS>
He
made
belive
as
if
it
had
been
the
ould
edmiral
;
but
the
ould
edmiral
could
not
have
made
his
air
to
stand
on
end
,
and
his
teeth
to
shatter
;
but
he
said
so
in
prudence
,
that
the
ladies
mought
not
be
affear'd
.
<EOS>
Miss
Liddy
has
been
puny

and

<EOS>
I

her

As

<EOS>
Her

but
,
for

she

she

proper

DEAR
KNIGHT
,
ONCE
more
I
tread
upon
English
ground
,
which
I
like
not
the
worse
for
the
six
week
's
ramble
<EOS>
I
have
made
among
the
woods
and
mountains
of
Caledonia
;
no
offence
to
the
land
of
cakes
,
where
bannocks
grow
upon
straw
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
my
uncle
in
such
health
and
spirits
and
he
now
enjoys
.
<EOS>
Liddy
is
perfectly
recovered
;
and
Mrs
Tabitha
has
no
reason
to
complain
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
believe
,
she
was
,
till
yesterday
,
inclined
to
give
the
whole
Scotch
nation
to
the
devil
,
as
a
pack
of
insensible
brutes
,
upon
whom
her
accomplishments
had
been
displayed
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
At
every
place
where
we
halted
,
did
she
mount
the
stage
,
and
flourished
her
rusty
arms
,
without
being
able
to
make
one
conquest
.
<EOS>
One
of
her
last
essays
was
against
the
heart
of
sir
George
Calquhoun
,
with
whom
she
fought
all
the
weapons
more
than
twice
over
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
grave
and
gay
by
turns
 
<EOS>
she
moralized
and
methodized
 
<EOS>
she
laughed
,
and
romped
,
and
danced
,
and
sung
,
and
sighed
,
and
ogled
,
and
lisped
,
and
stuttered
,
and
flattered
 
but
all
was
preaching
to
the
desart
  
<EOS>
The
baronet
,
being
a
well
-
bred
man
,
carried
his
civilities
as
far
as
she
could
in
conscience
expect
,
and
,
if
evil
tongues
are
to
be
believed
,
some
degrees
farther
;
but
he
was
too
much
a
veteran
in
gallantry
,
as
well
as
in
war
,
to
fall
into
any
ambuscade
that
she
could
lay
for
his
affection
.
  
<EOS>
While
we
were
absent
in
the
Highlands
,
she
practised
also
upon
the
laird
of
Ladrishmore
,
and
even
gave
him
the
rendezvous
in
the
wood
of
Drumscailloch
;
but
the
laird
had
such
a
reverend
care
of
his
own
reputation
,
that
he
came
attended
with
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
and
nothing
passed
but
spiritual
communication
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
these
miscarriages
,
our
aunt
suddenly
recollected
lieutenant
Lismahago
.
<EOS>
whom
,
ever
since
our
first
arrival
at
Edinburgh
,
she
seemed
to
have
utterly
forgot
;
but
now
she
expressed
her
hopes
of
seeing
him
at
Dumfries
,
according
to
his
promise
.
    
<EOS>
We
set
out
from
Glasgow
by
the
way
of
Lanerk
,
the
country
-
town
of
Clydesdale
,
in
the
neighbourhood
of
which
,
the
whole
river
Clyde
,
rushing
down
a
steep
rock
,
forms
a
very
noble
and
stupendous
cascade
.
<EOS>
Next
day
we
were
obliged
to
halt
in
a
small
borough
,
until
the
carriage
,
which
had
received
some
damage
,
should
be
repaired
;
and
here
we
met
with
an
incident
which
warmly
interested
the
benevolent
spirit
of
Mr
Bramble
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
stood
at
the
window
of
an
inn
that
fronted
the
public
prison
,
a
person
arrived
on
horseback
,
genteelly
,
tho
'
plainly
,
dressed
in
a
blue
frock
,
<EOS>
with
his
own
hair
cut
short
,
and
a
gold
-
laced
hat
upon
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
Alighting
,
and
giving
his
horse
to
the
landlord
,
he
advanced
to
an
old
man
who
was
at
work
in
paving
the
street
,
and
accosted
him
in
these
words
:
"
This
is
hard
work
for
such
an
old
man
as
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
took
the
instrument
out
of
his
hand
,
and
began
to
thump
the
pavement
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
few
strokes
,
"
Have
you
never
a
son
(
said
he
)
to
ease
you
of
this
labour
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
an
please
your
honour
,
(
replied
the
senior
)
<EOS>
I
have
three
hopeful
lads
,
but
,
at
present
,
they
are
out
of
the
way
.
"
<EOS>
"
Honour
not
me
(
cried
the
stranger
)
;
it
more
becomes
me
to
honour
your
grey
hair
.
  
<EOS>
Where
are
those
sons
you
talk
of
?
<EOS>
"
The
ancient
paviour
said
,
his
eldest
son
was
a
captain
in
the
East
-
Indies
;
and
the
youngest
had
lately
inlisted
as
a
soldier
;
in
hopes
of
prospering
like
his
brother
.
<EOS>
The
gentleman
desiring
to
know
what
was
become
of
the
second
,
he
wiped
his
eyes
,
and
owned
,
he
had
taken
upon
him
his
old
father
's
debts
,
for
which
he
was
now
in
the
prison
hard
by
.
    
<EOS>
The
traveller
made
three
quick
steps
towards
the
gaol
,
then
turning
short
,
"
Tell
me
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
has
that
unnatural
captain
sent
you
nothing
to
relive
your
distresses
?
"
<EOS>
"
Call
him
not
unnatural
(
replied
the
the
other
)
;
God
's
blessing
be
upon
him
!
<EOS>
he
sent
me
a
great
deal
of
money
;
but
I
made
a
bad
use
of
it
;
I
lost
it
by
being
security
for
a
gentleman
that
was
my
landlord
,
and
was
stript
of
all
I
had
in
the
world
besides
.
"
<EOS>
At
that
instant
a
young
man
,
thrusting
out
his
head
and
neck
between
two
iron
bars
in
the
prison
window
,
exclaimed
,
"
Father
!
<EOS>
father
!
<EOS>
if
my
brother
William
is
in
life
,
that
's
he
!
<EOS>
"
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
!
 
<EOS>
(
cried
the
stranger
,
clasping
the
old
man
in
his
arms
,
and
shedding
a
flood
of
tears
)
 
<EOS>
I
am
your
son
<EOS>
Willy
,
sure
enough
!
<EOS>
Before
the
father
,
who
was
quite
confounded
,
could
make
any
return
to
this
tenderness
,
a
decent
old
woman
bolting
out
from
the
door
of
a
poor
habitation
,
cried
,
"
<EOS>
Where
is
my
bairn
?
<EOS>
where
is
my
dear
Willy
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
captain
no
sooner
beheld
her
,
than
he
quitted
his
father
,
and
ran
into
her
embrace
.
    
<EOS>
I
can
assure
you
,
my
uncle
,
who
saw
and
heard
every
thing
that
passed
,
was
as
much
moved
as
any
one
of
the
parties
concerned
in
this
pathetic
recognition
.
  
<EOS>
He
sobbed
,
and
wept
,
and
clapped
his
hands
,
and
hollowed
,
and
finally
ran
down
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
captain
had
retired
with
his
parents
,
and
all
the
inhabitants
of
the
place
were
assembled
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
,
nevertheless
,
pressed
thro
'
the
crowd
,
and
entering
the
house
,
"
Captain
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
beg
the
favour
of
your
acquaintance
  
<EOS>
I
would
have
travelled
a
hundred
miles
to
see
this
affecting
scene
;
and
I
shall
think
myself
happy
,
if
you
and
your
parents
will
dine
with
me
at
the
public
house
.
<EOS>
"
The
captain
thanked
him
for
his
kind
invitation
,
which
,
he
said
,
he
would
accept
with
pleasure
;
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
he
could
not
think
of
eating
or
drinking
,
while
his
poor
brother
was
in
trouble
.
  
<EOS>
He
forthwith
deposited
a
sum
equal
to
the
debt
in
the
hands
of
the
magistrate
,
who
ventured
to
set
his
brother
at
liberty
without
farther
process
;
and
then
the
whole
family
repaired
to
the
inn
with
my
uncle
,
attended
by
the
crowd
,
the
individuals
of
which
shook
their
townsman
by
the
hand
,
while
he
returned
their
caresses
without
the
least
sign
of
pride
or
affectation
.
    
<EOS>
This
honest
favourite
of
fortune
,
whose
name
was
Brown
,
told
my
uncle
,
that
he
had
been
bred
a
weaver
,
and
,
about
eighteen
years
ago
,
had
from
a
spirit
of
idleness
and
dissipation
,
enlisted
as
a
soldier
in
the
service
of
the
East
-
India
company
;
that
,
in
the
course
of
duty
,
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
attract
the
notice
and
approbation
of
lord
Clive
,
who
preferred
him
from
one
step
to
another
,
till
he
attained
the
rank
of
captain
and
pay
-
master
to
the
regiment
,
in
which
capacities
he
had
honestly
amassed
above
twelve
thousand
pounds
,
and
,
at
the
peace
,
resigned
his
commission
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
sent
several
remittances
to
his
father
,
who
received
the
first
only
,
consisting
of
one
hundred
pounds
;
the
second
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
a
bankrupt
;
and
the
third
had
been
consigned
to
a
gentleman
of
Scotland
,
who
died
before
it
arrived
;
so
that
it
still
remained
to
be
accounted
for
by
his
executors
.
<EOS>
He
now
presented
the
old
man
with
fifty
pounds
for
his
present
occasions
,
over
and
above
bank
notes
for
one
hundred
,
which
he
had
deposited
for
his
brother
's
release
.
  
<EOS>
He
brought
along
with
him
a
deed
ready
executed
,
by
which
he
settled
a
perpetuity
of
four
-
score
pounds
upon
his
parents
,
to
be
inherited
by
their
other
two
sons
after
their
decease
.
  
<EOS>
He
promised
to
purchase
a
commission
for
his
youngest
brother
;
to
take
the
other
as
his
own
partner
in
a
manufacture
which
he
intended
to
set
up
,
to
give
employment
and
bread
to
the
industrious
;
and
to
give
five
hundred
pounds
,
by
way
of
dower
,
to
his
sister
,
who
had
married
a
farmer
in
low
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
Finally
,
he
gave
fifty
pounds
to
the
poor
of
the
town
where
he
was
born
,
and
feasted
all
the
inhabitants
without
exception
.
    
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
so
charmed
with
the
character
of
captain
Brown
,
that
he
drank
his
health
three
times
successively
at
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
was
proud
of
his
acquaintance
;
that
he
was
an
honour
to
his
country
,
and
had
in
some
measure
redeemed
human
nature
from
the
reproach
of
pride
,
selfishness
,
and
ingratitude
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
was
as
much
pleased
with
the
modesty
as
with
the
filial
virtue
of
this
honest
soldier
,
who
assumed
no
merit
from
his
success
,
and
said
very
little
of
his
own
transactions
,
though
the
answers
he
made
to
our
inquiries
were
equally
sensible
and
laconic
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
behaved
very
graciously
to
him
untill
<EOS>
she
understood
that
he
was
going
to
make
a
tender
of
his
hand
to
a
person
of
low
estate
,
who
had
been
his
sweet
-
heart
while
he
worked
as
a
journeyman
weaver
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
was
no
sooner
made
acquainted
with
this
design
,
than
she
starched
up
her
behaviour
with
a
double
proportion
of
reserve
;
and
when
the
company
broke
up
,
she
observed
,
with
a
toss
of
her
nose
,
that
Brown
was
a
civil
fellow
enough
,
considering
the
lowness
of
his
origin
;
but
that
Fortune
,
though
she
had
mended
his
circumstances
,
was
incapable
to
raise
his
ideas
,
which
were
still
humble
and
plebeian
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
day
that
succeeded
this
adventure
,
we
went
some
miles
out
of
our
road
to
see
Drumlanrig
,
a
seat
belonging
to
the
duke
of
Queensbury
,
which
appears
like
a
magnificent
palace
erected
by
magic
,
in
the
midst
of
a
wilderness
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
a
princely
mansion
,
with
suitable
parks
and
plantations
,
rendered
still
more
striking
by
the
nakedness
of
the
surrounding
country
,
which
is
one
of
the
wildest
tracts
in
all
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
This
wildness
,
however
,
is
different
from
that
of
the
Highlands
;
for
here
the
mountains
,
instead
of
heath
,
are
covered
with
a
fine
green
sward
,
affording
pasture
to
innumerable
flocks
of
sheep
.
<EOS>
But
the
fleeces
of
this
country
,
called
Nithsdale
,
are
not
comparable
to
the
wool
of
Galloway
,
which
is
said
to
equal
that
of
Salisbury

Having
passed
the
night
at
the
castle
of
Drumlanrig
,
by
invitation
from
the
duke
himself
,
who
is
one
of
the
best
men
that
ever
breathed
,
we
prosecuted
our
journey
to
Dumfries
,
a
very
elegant
trading
town
near
the
borders
of
England
,
where
we
found
plenty
of
good
provision
and
excellent
wine
,
at
very
reasonable
prices
,
and
the
accommodation
as
good
in
all
respects
as
in
any
part
of
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
was
confined
to
Scotland
for
life
,
I
would
choose
Dumfries
as
the
place
of
my
residence
.
<EOS>
Here
we
made
enquiries
about
captain
Lismahago
,
of
whom
hearing
no
tidings
,
we
proceeded
,
by
the
Solway
Frith
,
to
Carlisle
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
the
Solway
sands
,
upon
which
travellers
pass
at
low
water
,
are
exceedingly
dangerous
,
because
,
as
the
tide
makes
,
they
become
quick
in
different
places
,
and
the
flood
rushes
in
so
impetuously
,
that
passengers
are
often
overtaken
by
the
sea
,
and
perish
.
    
<EOS>
In
crossing
these
treacherous
Syrtes
with
a
guide
we
perceived
a
drowned
horse
,
which
Humphry
Clinker
,
after
due
inspection
,
declared
to
be
the
very
identical
beast
which
Mr
Lismahago
rode
when
he
parted
with
us
at
Felton
-
bridge
in
Northumberland
.
<EOS>
This
information
,
which
seemed
to
intimate
that
our
friend
the
lieutenant
had
shared
the
fate
of
his
horse
,
affected
us
all
,
and
above
all
our
aunt
Tabitha
,
who
shed
salt
tears
,
and
obliged
Clinker
to
pull
a
few
hairs
out
of
the
dead
horse
's
tail
,
to
be
worn
in
a
ring
as
a
remembrance
of
his
master
:
but
<EOS>
her
grief
and
ours
was
not
of
long
duration
;
for
one
of
the
first
persons
we
saw
in
Carlisle
,
was
the
lieutenant
in
propria
persona
,
bargaining
with
a
horse
-
dealer
for
another
steed
,
in
the
yard
of
the
inn
where
we
alighted
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Bramble
was
the
first
that
perceived
him
,
and
screamed
as
if
she
had
seen
a
ghost
;
and
truly
,
at
a
proper
time
and
place
,
he
might
very
well
have
passed
for
an
inhabitant
of
another
world
;
for
he
was
more
meagre
and
grim
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
We
received
him
the
more
cordially
for
having
supposed
he
hath
been
drowned
;
and
he
was
not
deficient
in
expressions
of
satisfaction
at
this
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
us
,
he
had
enquired
for
us
at
Dumfries
,
and
been
informed
by
a
travelling
merchant
from
Glascow
,
that
we
had
resolved
to
return
by
the
way
of
Coldstream
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
,
that
,
in
passing
the
sands
without
a
guide
,
his
horse
had
knocked
up
;
and
he
himself
must
have
perished
,
if
he
had
not
been
providentially
relieved
by
a
returned
post
-
chaise
.
  
<EOS>
He
moreover
gave
us
to
understand
,
that
his
scheme
of
settling
in
his
own
country
having
miscarried
,
he
was
so
far
on
his
way
to
London
,
with
a
view
to
embark
for
North
-
America
;
where
he
intended
to
pass
the
rest
of
his
days
among
his
old
friends
the
Miamis
,
and
amuse
himself
in
finishing
the
education
of
the
son
he
had
by
his
beloved
Squinkinacoosta
.
    
<EOS>
This
project
was
by
no
means
agreeable
to
our
good
aunt
,
who
expatiated
upon
the
fatigues
and
dangers
that
would
attend
such
a
long
voyage
by
sea
,
and
afterwards
such
a
tedious
journey
by
land
  
<EOS>
She
enlarged
particularly
on
the
risque
he
would
run
with
respect
to
the
concerns
of
his
precious
soul
,
among
savages
who
had
not
yet
received
the
glad
tidings
of
salvation
;
and
she
hinted
that
his
abandoning
Great
-
Britain
might
,
perhaps
,
prove
fatal
to
the
inclinations
of
some
deserving
person
,
whom
he
was
qualified
to
make
happy
for
life
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
who
is
really
a
Don
Quixote
in
generosity
,
understanding
that
Lismahago
's
real
reason
for
leaving
Scotland
was
the
impossibility
of
subsisting
in
it
with
any
decency
upon
the
wretched
provision
of
a
subaltern
's
half
-
pay
,
began
to
be
warmly
interested
on
the
side
of
compassion
  
<EOS>
He
thought
it
very
hard
,
that
a
gentleman
,
who
had
served
his
country
with
honour
,
should
be
driven
by
necessity
to
spend
his
old
age
,
among
the
refuse
of
mankind
,
in
such
a
remote
part
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
He
discoursed
with
me
upon
the
subject
;
observing
,
that
he
would
willingly
offer
the
lieutenant
an
asylum
at
brambleton
-
hall
,
if
he
did
not
foresee
that
his
singularities
and
humour
of
contradiction
would
render
him
an
intolerable
housemate
,
though
his
conversation
at
some
time
might
be
both
instructive
and
entertaining
:
but
as
there
seemed
to
be
something
particular
in
his
attention
to
Mrs
Thabitha
,
he
and
I
agreed
in
opinion
,
that
this
intercourse
should
be
encouraged
,
and
improved
,
if
possible
,
into
a
matrimonial
union
;
in
which
case
there
would
be
a
comfortable
provision
for
both
;
and
they
might
be
settled
in
a
house
of
their
own
,
so
that
Mrs
Bramble
should
have
no
more
of
their
company
than
he
desired
.
    
<EOS>
In
pursuance
of
this
design
,
Lismahago
has
been
invited
to
pass
the
winter
at
Brambleton
-
hall
,
as
it
will
be
time
enough
to
execute
his
American
project
in
the
spring
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
taken
time
to
consider
of
this
proposal
;
mean
while
,
he
will
keep
us
company
as
far
as
we
travel
in
the
road
to
Bristol
,
where
he
has
hopes
of
getting
a
passage
for
America
.
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
but
that
he
will
postpone
his
voyage
,
and
prosecute
his
addresses
to
a
happy
consummation
;
and
sure
,
if
it
produces
any
fruit
,
it
must
be
of
a
very
peculiar
flavour
.
<EOS>
As
the
weather
continues
favourable
,
I
believe
,
we
shall
take
the
Peak
of
Derbyshire
and
Buxton
Wells
in
our
way
.
  
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
from
the
first
place
where
we
make
any
stay
,
you
shall
hear
again
from
    
Yours
always

To

<EOS>
DEAR
DOCTOR
,
THE
peasantry
of
Scotland
are
certainly
on
a
poor
footing
all
over
the
kingdom
;
and
yet
they
look
better
,
and
are
better
cloathed
than
those
of
the
same
rank
in
Burgundy
,
and
many
other
places
of
France
and
Italy
;
nay
,
I
will
venture
to
say
they
are
better
fed
notwithstanding
the
boasted
wine
of
these
foreign
countries
.
<EOS>
The
country
people
of
North
-
Britain
live
chiefly
on
oat
-
meal
,
and
milk
,
cheese
,
butter
,
and
some
garden
-
stuff
,
with
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
pickled
-
herring
,
by
way
of
delicacy
;
but
flesh
-
meat
<EOS>
they
seldom
or
never
taste
;
nor
any
kind
of
strong
liquor
,
except
two
-
penny
,
at
times
of
uncommon
festivity
  
Their
breakfast
is
a
kind
of
hasty
pudding
,
of
oat
-
meal
or
pease
-
meal
,
eaten
with
milk
.
<EOS>
They
have
commonly
pottage
to
dinner
,
composed
of
cale
or
cole
,
leeks
,
barley
or
big
,
and
butter
;
and
this
is
reinforced
with
bread
and
cheese
,
made
of
skimmed
-
milk
  
<EOS>
At
night
they
sup
on
sowens
or
flummery
of
oatmeal
  
<EOS>
In
a
scarcity
of
oats
,
they
use
the
meal
of
barley
and
pease
,
which
is
both
nourishing
and
palatable
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
have
potatoes
;
and
you
find
parsnips
in
every
peasant
's
garden
  
<EOS>
They
are
cloathed
with
a
coarse
kind
of
russet
of
their
own
making
,
which
is
both
decent
and
warm
  
<EOS>
They
dwell
in
poor
huts
,
built
of
loose
stones
and
turf
,
without
any
mortar
,
having
a
fire
place
or
hearth
in
the
middle
,
generally
made
of
an
old
mill
-
stone
,
and
a
hole
at
top
to
let
out
the
smoke
.
    
<EOS>
These
people
,
however
,
are
content
,
and
wonderfully
sagacious
  
<EOS>
All
of
them
read
the
Bible
,
and
are
even
qualified
to
dispute
upon
the
articles
of
their
faith
;
which
,
in
those
parts
I
have
seen
,
is
entirely
Presbyterian
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
,
that
the
inhabitants
of
Aberdeenshire
are
still
more
acute
.
<EOS>
I
once
knew
a
Scotch
gentleman
at
London
,
who
had
declared
war
against
this
part
of
his
countrymen
;
and
swore
that
the
impudence
and
knavery
of
the
Scots
,
in
that
quarter
,
had
brought
a
reproach
upon
the
whole
nation
.
    
<EOS>
The
river
Clyde
,
above
Glasgow
,
is
quite
pastoral
;
and
the
banks
of
it
are
every
where
adorned
with
fine
villas
.
<EOS>
From
the
sea
to
its
source
,
we
may
reckon
the
seats
of
many
families
of
the
first
rank
,
such
as
the
duke
of
Argyle
at
Roseneath
,
the
earl
of
Bute
in
the
isle
of
that
name
,
the
earl
of
Glencairn
at
Finlayston
;
lord
Blantyre
at
Areskine
,
the
dutchess
of
Douglas
at
Bothwell
,
duke
Hamilton
at
Hamilton
,
the
duke
of
Douglas
at
Douglas
,
and
the
earl
of
Hyndford
at
Carmichael
-
Hamilton
is
a
noble
palace
,
magnificently
furnished
;
and
hard
by
is
the
village
of
that
name
,
one
of
the
neatest
little
towns
I
have
seen
in
any
country
.
<EOS>
The
old
castle
of
Douglas
being
burned
to
the
ground
by
accident
,
the
late
duke
resolved
,
as
head
of
the
first
family
in
Scotland
,
to
have
the
largest
house
in
the
kingdom
,
and
ordered
a
plan
for
this
purpose
;
but
there
was
only
one
wing
of
it
finished
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
be
hoped
that
his
nephew
,
who
is
now
in
possession
of
his
great
fortune
,
will
complete
the
design
of
his
predecessor
  
Clydesdale
is
in
general
populous
and
rich
,
containing
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
,
who
were
independent
in
their
fortune
;
but
it
produces
more
cattle
than
corn
  
<EOS>
This
is
also
the
case
with
Tweedale
,
through
part
of
which
we
passed
,
and
Nisdale
,
which
is
generally
rough
,
wild
,
and
mountainous
  
These
hills
are
covered
with
sheep
;
and
this
is
the
small
delicious
mutton
,
so
much
preferable
to
that
of
the
London
-
market
.
<EOS>
As
their
feeding
costs
so
little
,
the
sheep
are
not
killed
till
five
years
old
,
when
their
flesh
,
juices
,
and
flavour
,
are
in
perfection
;
but
their
fleeces
are
much
damaged
by
the
tar
,
with
which
they
are
smeared
to
preserve
them
from
the
rot
in
winter
,
during
which
they
run
wild
night
and
day
,
and
thousands
are
lost
under
huge
wreaths
of
snow
  
'
<EOS>
Tis
pity
the
farmers
can
not
contrive
some
means
to
shelter
this
useful
animal
from
the
inclemencies
of
a
rigorous
climate
,
especially
from
the
perpetual
rains
,
which
are
more
prejudicial
than
the
greatest
extremity
of
cold
weather
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
little
river
Nid
,
is
situated
the
castle
of
Drumlanrig
,
one
of
the
noblest
seats
in
Great
-
Britain
,
belonging
to
the
duke
of
Queensberry
;
one
of
those
few
noblemen
whose
goodness
of
heart
does
honour
to
human
-
nature
  
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
enter
into
a
description
of
this
palace
,
which
is
really
an
instance
of
the
sublime
in
magnificence
,
as
well
as
in
situation
,
and
puts
one
in
mind
of
the
beautiful
city
of
Palmyra
rising
like
a
vision
in
the
midst
of
the
wilderness
.
<EOS>
His
grace
keeps
open
house
,
and
lives
with
great
splendour
  
<EOS>
He
did
us
the
honour
to
receive
us
with
great
courtesy
,
and
detain
us
all
night
,
together
with
above
twenty
other
guests
,
with
all
their
servants
and
horses
,
to
a
very
considerable
number
  
The
dutchess
was
equally
gracious
,
and
took
our
ladies
under
her
immediate
protection
.
<EOS>
The
longer
I
live
,
I
see
more
reason
to
believe
that
prejudices
of
education
are
never
wholly
eradicated
,
even
when
they
are
discovered
to
be
erroneous
and
absurd
.
<EOS>
Such
habits
of
thinking
as
interest
<EOS>
the
grand
passions
,
cleave
to
the
human
heart
in
such
a
manner
,
that
though
an
effort
of
reason
may
force
them
from
their
hold
for
a
moment
,
this
violence
no
sooner
ceases
,
than
they
resume
their
grasp
with
an
encreased
elasticity
and
adhesion
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
led
into
this
reflection
,
by
what
passed
at
the
duke
's
table
after
supper
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
turned
upon
the
vulgar
notions
of
spirits
and
omens
,
that
prevail
among
the
commonalty
of
North
-
Britain
,
and
,
all
the
company
agreed
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
One
gentleman
however
told
a
remarkable
story
of
himself
,
by
way
of
speculation
  
"
Being
on
a
party
of
hunting
in
the
North
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
visit
an
old
friend
,
whom
I
had
not
seen
for
twenty
years
<EOS>
So
long
he
had
been
retired
and
sequestered
from
all
his
acquaintance
,
and
lived
in
a
moping
melancholy
way
,
much
afflicted
with
lowness
of
spirits
,
occasioned
by
the
death
of
his
wife
,
whom
he
had
loved
with
uncommon
affection
.
<EOS>
As
he
resided
in
a
remote
part
of
the
country
,
and
we
were
five
gentlemen
with
as
many
servants
,
we
carried
some
provision
with
us
from
the
next
market
town
,
lest
we
should
find
him
unprepared
for
our
reception
:
<EOS>
The
roads
being
bad
<EOS>
,
we
did
not
arrive
at
the
house
till
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
were
agreeably
surprised
to
find
a
very
good
dinner
ready
in
the
kitchen
,
and
the
cloth
laid
with
six
covers
.
<EOS>
My
friend
himself
appeared
in
his
best
apparel
at
the
gate
,
and
received
us
with
open
arms
,
telling
me
he
had
been
expecting
us
these
two
hours
  
<EOS>
Astonished
at
this
declaration
,
I
asked
who
had
given
him
intelligence
of
our
coming
?
<EOS>
and
he
smiled
without
making
any
other
reply
  
However
,
presuming
upon
our
former
intimacy
<EOS>
,
I
afterwards
insisted
upon
knowing
;
and
he
told
me
,
very
gravely
,
he
had
seen
me
in
a
vision
of
the
second
sight
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
called
in
the
evidence
of
his
steward
,
who
solemnly
declared
,
that
his
master
had
the
day
before
apprised
him
of
my
coming
,
with
four
other
strangers
,
and
ordered
him
to
provide
accordingly
;
in
consequence
of
which
intimatition
,
he
had
prepared
the
dinner
which
we
were
then
eating
;
and
laid
the
covers
according
to
the
number
foretold
.
<EOS>
"
The
incident
we
all
owned
to
be
remarkable
,
and
I
endeavoured
to
account
for
it
by
natural
means
.
<EOS>
I
observed
,
that
as
the
gentleman
was
of
a
visionary
turn
,
the
casual
idea
,
or
remembrance
of
his
old
friend
,
might
suggest
those
circumstances
,
which
accident
had
for
once
realized
;
but
that
in
all
probability
he
had
seen
many
visions
of
the
same
kind
,
which
were
never
verified
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
company
directly
dissented
from
my
opinion
;
but
from
the
objections
that
were
hinted
,
I
could
plainly
perceive
,
that
the
majority
were
persuaded
there
was
something
more
extraordinary
in
the
case
.
    
<EOS>
Another
gentleman
of
the
company
addressing
himself
to
me
,
"
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
(
said
he
)
a
deceased
imagination
is
very
apt
to
produce
visions
;
but
we
must
find
some
other
method
to
account
for
something
of
this
kind
,
that
happened
within
these
eight
days
in
my
neighbourhood
  
<EOS>
A
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
who
can
not
be
deemed
a
visionary
in
any
sense
of
the
word
,
was
near
his
own
gate
,
in
the
twilight
,
visited
by
his
grandfather
,
who
has
been
dead
these
fifteen
years
  
<EOS>
The
spectre
was
mounted
seemingly
on
the
very
horse
he
used
to
ride
,
with
an
angry
and
terrible
countenance
,
and
said
something
,
which
his
grandson
,
in
the
confusion
of
his
fear
,
could
not
understand
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
all
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
up
a
huge
horsewhip
,
and
applied
it
with
great
violence
to
his
back
and
shoulders
,
on
which
I
saw
the
impression
with
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
apparition
was
afterwards
seen
by
the
sexton
of
the
parish
,
hovering
about
the
tomb
where
his
body
lies
interred
;
as
the
man
declared
to
several
persons
in
the
village
,
before
he
knew
what
had
happened
to
the
gentleman
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
actually
came
to
me
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
in
order
to
make
oath
of
these
particulars
,
which
,
however
,
I
declined
administering
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
grandson
of
the
defunct
,
he
is
a
sober
,
sensible
,
worldly
-
minded
fellow
,
too
intent
upon
schemes
of
interest
to
give
into
reveries
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
willingly
concealed
the
affair
;
but
he
bawled
out
in
the
first
transport
of
his
fear
,
and
running
into
the
house
,
exposed
his
back
and
his
sconce
to
the
whole
family
;
so
that
there
was
no
denying
it
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
the
common
discourse
of
the
country
,
that
this
appearance
and
behaviour
of
the
old
man
's
spirit
,
portends
some
great
calamity
to
the
family
,
and
the
good
-
woman
has
actually
taken
to
her
bed
in
this
apprehension
.
"
    
<EOS>
Though
I
did
not
pretend
to
explain
this
mystery
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
did
not
at
all
doubt
,
but
it
would
one
day
appear
to
be
a
deception
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
a
scheme
executed
by
some
enemy
of
h
person
who
had
sustained
the
assault
;
but
<EOS>
still
the
gentleman
insisted
upon
the
clearness
of
the
evidence
,
and
the
concurrence
of
testimony
,
by
which
two
creditable
witnesses
,
without
any
communication
one
with
another
,
affirmed
the
appearance
of
the
same
man
,
with
whose
person
they
were
both
well
acquainted
  
<EOS>
From
Drumlanrig
we
pursued
the
course
of
the
Nid
to
Dumfries
,
which
stands
several
miles
above
the
place
where
the
river
falls
into
the
sea
;
and
is
,
after
Glasgow
,
the
handsomest
town
I
have
seen
in
Scotland
  
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
,
indeed
,
seem
to
have
proposed
that
city
as
their
model
;
not
only
in
beautifying
their
town
and
regulating
its
police
,
but
also
in
prosecuting
their
schemes
of
commerce
and
manufacture
,
by
which
they
are
grown
rich
and
opulent
.
    
<EOS>
We
re
-
entered
England
,
by
the
way
of
Carlisle
,
where
we
accidently
met
with
our
friend
Lismahago
,
whom
we
had
in
vain
enquired
after
at
Dumfries
and
other
places
  
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
the
captain
,
like
the
prophets
of
old
,
is
but
little
honoured
in
his
own
country
,
which
he
has
now
renounced
for
ever
  
<EOS>
He
gave
me
the
following
particulars
of
his
visit
to
his
native
soil
  
<EOS>
In
his
way
to
the
place
of
his
nativity
,
he
learned
that
his
nephew
had
married
the
daughter
of
a
burgeois
,
who
directed
a
weaving
manufacture
,
and
had
gone
into
partnership
with
his
father
in
-
law
:
chagrined
with
this
information
,
he
had
arrived
at
the
gate
in
the
twilight
,
where
he
heard
the
sound
of
treddles
in
the
great
hall
,
which
had
exasperated
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
had
like
to
have
lost
his
senses
:
while
he
was
thus
transported
with
indignation
,
his
nephew
chanced
to
come
forth
,
when
,
being
no
longer
master
of
his
passion
,
he
cried
,
"
Degenerate
rascal
!
<EOS>
you
have
made
my
father
's
house
a
den
of
thieves
;
"
and
at
the
same
time
chastised
him
with
his
horse
-
whip
;
then
,
riding
round
the
adjoining
village
,
he
had
visited
the
burying
-
ground
of
his
ancestors
by
moon
-
light
;
and
,
having
paid
his
respects
to
their
manes
,
travelled
all
night
to
another
part
of
the
country
  
Finding
the
head
of
his
family
in
such
a
disgraceful
situation
,
all
his
own
friends
dead
or
removed
from
the
places
of
their
former
residence
,
and
the
expence
of
living
encreased
to
double
of
what
it
had
been
,
when
he
first
left
his
native
country
,
he
had
bid
it
an
eternal
adieu
,
and
was
determined
to
seek
for
repose
among
the
forests
of
America
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
no
longer
at
a
loss
to
account
for
the
apparition
,
which
had
been
described
at
Drumlanrig
;
and
when
I
repeated
the
story
to
the
lieutenant
,
he
was
much
pleased
to
think
his
resentment
had
been
so
much
more
effectual
than
he
intended
;
and
he
owned
,
he
might
at
such
an
hour
,
and
in
such
an
equipage
,
very
well
pass
for
the
ghost
of
his
father
,
whom
he
was
said
greatly
to
resemble
  
Between
friends
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
Lismahago
will
find
a
retreat
without
going
so
far
as
the
wigwams
of
the
Miamis
.
<EOS>
My
sister
Tabby
is
making
continual
advances
to
him
,
in
the
way
of
affection
;
and
,
if
I
may
trust
to
appearances
,
the
captain
is
disposed
to
take
opportunity
by
the
forelock
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
intend
to
encourage
this
correspondence
,
and
shall
be
glad
to
see
them
united
  
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
we
shall
find
a
way
to
settle
them
comfortably
in
our
own
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
I
,
and
my
servants
,
will
get
rid
of
a
very
troublesome
and
tyrannic
gouvernante
;
and
I
shall
have
the
benefit
of
Lismahago
's
conversation
,
without
being
obliged
to
take
more
of
his
company
than
I
desire
;
for
though
an
olla
is
a
high
-
flavoured
dish
,
I
could
not
bear
to
dine
upon
it
every
day
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
I
am
much
pleased
with
Manchester
,
which
is
one
of
the
most
agreeable
and
flourishing
towns
in
Great
-
Britain
;
and
I
perceive
that
this
is
the
place
which
hath
animated
the
spirit
,
and
suggested
the
chief
manufactures
of
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
We
propose
to
visit
Chatsworth
,
the
Peak
,
and
Buxton
,
from
which
last
place
we
shall
proceed
directly
homewards
,
though
by
easy
journies
.
<EOS>
If
the
season
has
been
as
favourable
in
Wales
as
in
the
North

your

is
happily
finished

and
we
have
nothing
left
to
think
of
but
our
October
,
of
which
let
Barns
be
properly
reminded
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
me
much
better
in
flesh
than
I
was
at
our
parting
;
and
this
short
separation
has
given
a
new
edge
to
those
sentiments
of
friendships
with
which
I
always
have
been
,
and
ever
shall
be

By

burn

have
the

dusted

the

well

As

I
do
suppose
there
is
a

chickings

guzzlings
about
the

and
a
brave
kergo

and
that

been

saving

make

I
exhorted

<EOS>
DEAR
LEWIS
LISMAHAGO
is
more
paradoxical
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
The
late
gulp
he
had
of
his
native
air
,
seems
to
have
blown
fresh
spirit
into
all
his
polemical
faculties
.
<EOS>
I
congratulated
him
the
other
day
on
the
present
flourishing
state
of
his
country
,
observing
that
the
Scots
were
now
in
a
fair
way
to
wipe
off
the
national
reproach
of
poverty
,
and
expressing
my
satisfaction
at
the
happy
effects
of
the
union
,
so
conspicuous
in
the
improvement
if
their
agriculture
,
commerce
,
manufactures
,
and
manners
  
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
screwing
up
his
features
into
a
look
of
dissent
and
disgust
,
commented
on
my
remarks
to
this
effect
  
<EOS>
"
Those
who
reproach
a
nation
for
its
poverty
,
when
it
is
not
owing
to
the
profligacy
or
vice
of
the
people
,
deserve
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
Lacedaemonians
were
poorer
than
the
Scots
,
when
they
took
the
lead
among
all
the
free
states
of
Greece
,
and
were
esteemed
above
them
all
for
their
valour
and
their
virtue
.
<EOS>
The
most
respectable
heroes
of
ancient
Rome
,
such
as
Fabricius
,
Cincinnatus
,
and
Regulus
,
were
poorer
than
the
poorest
freeholder
in
Scotland
;
and
there
are
at
this
day
individuals
in
North
-
Britain
,
one
of
whom
can
produce
more
gold
and
silver
than
the
whole
public
of
Rome
could
raise
at
those
times
when
her
public
virtue
shone
with
unrivalled
lustre
;
and
poverty
was
so
far
from
being
a
reproach
,
that
it
added
fresh
laurels
to
her
fame
,
because
it
indicated
a
noble
contempt
of
wealth
,
which
was
proof
against
all
the
arts
of
corruption
  
<EOS>
If
poverty
be
a
subject
for
reproach
,
it
follows
that
wealth
is
the
object
of
esteem
and
veneration
  
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
there
are
Jews
and
others
in
Amsterdam
and
London
,
enriched
by
usury
,
peculation
,
and
different
species
of
fraud
and
extortion
,
who
are
more
estimable
than
the
most
virtuous
and
illustrious
members
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
An
absurdity
which
no
man
in
his
senses
will
offer
to
maintain
.
  
<EOS>
Riches
are
certainly
no
proof
of
merit
:
<EOS>
nay
,
they
are
often
(
if
not
most
commonly
)
acquired
by
persons
of
sordid
minds
and
mean
talents
:
nor
do
they
give
any
intrinsic
worth
to
the
possessor
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
tend
to
pervert
his
understanding
,
and
render
this
morals
more
depraved
.
<EOS>
But
granting
that
poverty
were
really
matter
of
reproach
,
it
can
not
be
justly
imputed
to
Scotland
.
<EOS>
No
country
is
poor
that
can
supply
its
inhabitants
with
the
necessaries
of
life

and
even
afford
articles

<EOS>
Scotland
is
rich
in
natural
advantages
:
it
produces
every
species
of
provision
in
abundance
,
vast
herds
of
cattle
and
flocks
of
sheep
,
with
a
great
number
of
horses
;
prodigious
quantities
of
wool
and
flax
,
with
plenty
of
copse
wood
,
and
in
some
parts
large
forests
of
timber
.
<EOS>
The
earth
is
still
more

The

abounds
with
excellent
fish

displays
a
surprising
number
of
cities
,
towns
,
villas
,
and
villages
,
swarming
with
people
;
and
there
seems
to
be
no
want
of
art
,
industry
,
government
,
and
police
:
such
a
kingdom
can
never
be
called
poor
,
in
any
sense
of
the
word
,
though
there
may
be
many
others
more
powerful
and
opulent
.
<EOS>
But
the
proper
use
of
those
advantages
,
and
the
present
prosperity
of
the
Scots
,
you
seem
to
derive
from
the
union
of
the
two
kingdoms
!
"
    
<EOS>
I
said
,
I
supposed
he
would
not
deny
that
the
appearance
of
the
country
was
much
mended
;
that
the
people
lived
better
,
had
more
trade
,
and
a
greater
quantity
of
money
circulating
since
the
union
,
than
before
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
safely
admit
these
premises
,
(
answered
the
lieutenant
)
without
subscribing
to
your
inference
.
<EOS>
The
difference
you
mention
<EOS>
,
I
should
take
to
be
the
natural
progress
of
improvement
  
Since
that
period
,
other
nations
,
such
as
the
Swedes
,
the
Danes
,
and
in
particular
the
French
,
have
greatly
increased
in
commerce
,
without
any
such
cause
assigned
.
<EOS>
Before
the
union
,
there
was
a
remarkable
spirit
of
trade
among
the
Scots
,
as
appeared
in
the
case
of
their
Darien
company
,
in
which
they
had
embarked
on
less
than
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
sterling
;
and
in
the
flourishing
state
of
the
maritime
towns
in
Fife
,
and
on
the
eastern
coast
,
enriched
by
their
trade
with
France
,
which
failed
in
consequence
of
the
union
.
<EOS>
The
only
solid
commercial
advantage
reaped
from
that
measure
,
was
the
privilege
of
trading
to
the
English
plantations
;
yet
,
excepting
Glasgow
and
Dumfries
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
any
other
Scotch
towns
concerned
in
that
traffick
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
,
I
conceive
the
Scots
were
losers
by
the
union
.
  
<EOS>
They
lost
the
independency
of
their
state
,
the
greatest
prop
of
national
spirit
;
they
lost
their
parliament
,
and
their
courts
of
justice
were
subjected
to
the
revision
and
supremacy
of
an
English
tribunal
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Softly
,
captain
,
(
cried
I
)
<EOS>
you
can
not
be
said
to
have
lost
your
own
parliament
,
while
you
are
represented
in
that
of
Great
-
Britain
.
"
<EOS>
"
True
,
(
said
he
,
with
a
sarcastic
grin
)
in
debates
of
national
competition
,
the
sixteen
peers
and
forty
-
five
commoners
of
Scotland
,
must
make
a
formidable
figure
in
the
scale
,
against
the
whole
English
legislature
.
"
<EOS>
"
Be
that
as
it
may
,
(
I
observed
)
while
I
had
the
honour
to
sit
in
the
lower
house
,
the
Scotch
members
had
always
the
majority
on
their
side
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
,
Sir
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
they
generally
side
with
the
majority
;
so
much
the
worse
for
their
constituents
.
<EOS>
But
even
this
evil
is
not
the
worst
they
have
sustained
by
the
union
.
<EOS>
Their
trade
has
been
saddled
with
grievous
impositions
,
and
every
article
of
living
severely
taxed
,
to
pay
the
interest
of
enormous
debts
,
contracted
by
the
English
,
in
support
of
measures
and
connections
in
which
the
Scots
had
no
interest
nor
concern
.
<EOS>
"
I
begged
he
would
at
least
allow
,
that
by
the
union
the
Scots
were
admitted
to
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
English
subjects
;
by
which
means
multitudes
of
them
were
provided
for
in
the
army
and
navy
,
and
got
fortunes
in
different
parts
of
England
,
and
its
dominions
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
these
,
(
said
he
)
become
English
subjects
;
to
all
intents
and
purposes
,
and
are
in
a
great
measure
lost
to
their
mother
-
country
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
of
rambling
and
adventure
has
been
always
peculiar
to
the
natives
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
not
met
with
encouragement
in
England
,
they
would
have
served
and
settled
,
as
formerly
,
in
other
countries
,
such
as
Muscovy
,
Sweden
,
Denmark
,
Poland
,
Germany
,
France
,
Piedmont
,
and
Italy
,
in
all
which
nations
their
descendents
continue
to
flourish
even
at
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
my
patience
began
to
fail
,
and
I
exclaimed
,
"
For
God
's
sake
,
what
has
England
got
by
this
union
which
,
you
say
,
has
been
so
productive
of
misfortune
to
the
Scots
.
"
<EOS>
"
Great
and
manifold
are
the
advantages
which
England
derives
from
the
union
(
said
Lismahago
,
in
a
solemn
tone
.
)
<EOS>
First
and
foremost
,
the
settlement
of
the
protestant
succession
,
a
point
which
the
English
ministry
drove
with
such
eagerness
that
no
stone
was
left
unturned
,
to
cajole
and
bribe
a
few
leading
men
,
to
cram
the
union
down
the
throats
of
the
Scottish
nation
,
who
where
surprisingly
reverse
to
the
expedient
.
<EOS>
They
gained
by
it
a
considerable
addition
of
territory
,
extending
their
dominion
to
the
sea
on
all
sides
of
the
island
,
thereby
shutting
up
all
back
-
doors
against
the
enterprizes
of
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
They
got
an
accession
of
above
a
million
of
useful
subjects
,
constituting
a
never
-
failing
nursery
of
seamen
,
soldiers
,
labourers
,
and
mechanics
;
a
most
valuable
acquisition
to
a
trading
country
,
exposed
to
foreign
wars
,
and
obliged
to
maintain
a
number
of
settlements
in
all
the
four
quarters
of
the
globe
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
seven
years
,
during
the
last
war
,
Scotland
furnished
the
English
army
and
navy
with
seventy
thousand
men
,
over
and
above
those
who
migrated
to
their
colonies
,
or
mingled
with
them
at
home
in
the
civil
departments
of
life
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
very
considerable
and
seasonable
supply
to
a
nation
,
whose
people
had
been
for
many
years
decreasing
in
number
,
and
whose
lands
and
manufactures
were
actually
suffering
for
want
of
hands
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
remind
you
of
the
hackneyed
maxim
,
that
to
a
nation
in
such
circumstances
,
a
supply
of
industrious
people
is
a
supply
of
wealth
;
nor
repeat
an
observation
,
which
is
now
received
as
an
eternal
truth
,
even
among
the
English
themselves
,
that
the
Scots
who
settle
in
South
-
Britain
,
are
remarkably
sober
,
orderly
,
and
industrious
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
allowed
the
truth
of
this
remark
,
adding
,
that
by
their
industry
,
oeconomy
,
and
circumspection
,
many
of
them
in
England
,
as
well
as
in
her
colonies
,
amassed
large
fortunes
,
with
which
they
returned
to
their
own
country
,
and
this
was
so
much
lost
to
South
-
Britain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
leave
,
sir
,
(
said
he
)
to
assure
you
,
that
in
your
fact
you
are
mistaken
,
and
in
your
deduction
,
erroneous
.
  
<EOS>
Not
one
in
two
hundred
that
leave
Scotland
ever
returns
to
settle
in
his
own
country
;
and
the
few
that
do
return
,
carry
thither
nothing
that
can
possibly
diminish
the
stock
of
South
-
Britain
;
for
none
of
their
treasure
stagnates
in
Scotland
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
continual
circulation
,
like
that
of
the
blood
in
the
human
body
,
and
England
is
the
heart
,
to
which
all
the
streams
which
it
distributes
are
refunded
and
returned
:
nay
,
in
consequence
of
that
luxury
which
our
connexion
with
England
hath
greatly
encouraged
,
if
not
introduced
,
all
the
produce
of
our
lands
,
and
all
the
profits
of
our
trade
,
are
engrossed
by
the
natives
of
South
-
Britain
;
for
you
will
find
that
the
exchange
between
the
two
kingdoms
is
always
against
Scotland
;
and
that
she
retains
neither
gold
nor
silver
sufficient
for
her
own
circulation
.
  
<EOS>
The
Scots
,
not
content
with
their
own
manufactures
and
produce
,
which
would
very
well
answer
all
necessary
occasions
,
seem
to
vie
with
each
other
in
purchasing
superfluities
from
England
;
such
as
broadcloth
,
velvets
,
stuffs
,
silks
,
lace
,
furs
,
jewels
,
furniture
of
all
sorts
,
sugar
,
rum
,
tea
,
chocolate
,
and
coffee
;
in
a
word
,
not
only
every
mode
of
the
most
extravagant
luxury
,
but
even
many
articles
of
convenience
,
which
they
might
find
as
good
,
and
much
cheaper
in
their
own
country
.
<EOS>
For
all
these
particulars
,
I
conceive
,
England
may
touch
about
one
million
sterling
a
-
year
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
pretend
to
make
an
exact
calculation
;
perhaps
,
it
may
be
something
less
,
and
,
perhaps
,
a
great
deal
more
.
  
<EOS>
The
annual
revenue
arising
from
all
the
private
estates
of
Scotland
can
not
fall
short
of
a
million
sterling
;
and
,
I
should
imagine
,
their
trade
will
amount
to
as
much
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
know
,
the
linen
manufacture
alone
returns
near
half
a
million
,
exclusive
of
the
home
-
consumption
of
that
article
.
  
<EOS>
If
,
therefore
,
North
-
Britain
pays
a
ballance
of
a
million
annually
to
England
,
I
insist
upon
it
,
that
country
is
more
valuable
to
her
in
the
way
of
commerce
,
than
any
colony
in
her
possession
,
over
and
above
the
other
advantages
which
I
have
specified
:
therefore
,
they
are
no
friends
,
either
to
England
or
to
truth
,
who
affect
to
depreciate
the
northern
part
of
the
united
kingdom
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
I
must
own
,
I
was
at
first
a
little
nettled
to
find
myself
schooled
in
so
many
particulars
.
<EOS>
Though
I
did
not
receive
all
his
assertions
as
gospel
,
I
was
not
prepared
to
refute
them
;
and
I
can
not
help
now
acquiescing
in
his
remarks
so
far
as
to
think
,
that
the
contempt
for
Scotland
,
which
prevails
too
much
on
this
side
the
Tweed
,
is
founded
on
prejudice
and
error
.
  
<EOS>
After
some
recollection
,
"
Well
,
captain
,
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
you
have
argued
stoutly
for
the
importance
of
your
own
country
:
for
my
part
,
I
have
such
a
regard
for
our
fellow
-
subjects
of
North
-
Britain
,
that
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
the
day
,
when
your
peasants
can
afford
to
give
all
their
oats
to
their
cattle
,
hogs
and
poultry
,
and
indulge
themselves
with
good
wheaten
loaves
,
instead
of
such
poor
,
unpalitable
,
and
inflammatory
diet
.
<EOS>
"
Here
again
I
brought
myself
into
a
premunire
with
the
disputaceous
Caledonian
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
hoped
he
should
never
see
the
common
people
lifted
out
of
that
sphere
for
which
they
were
intended
by
nature
and
the
course
of
things
;
that
they
might
have
some
reason
to
complain
of
their
bread
,
if
it
were
mixed
,
like
that
of
Norway
,
with
saw
-
dust
and
fish
-
bones
;
but
that
oatmeal
was
he
apprehended
,
as
nourishing
and
salutary
as
wheat
-
flour
,
and
the
Scots
in
general
thought
it
at
least
as
savoury
.
  
<EOS>
He
affirmed
,
that
a
mouse
,
which
,
in
the
article
of
self
-
preservation
,
might
be
supposed
to
act
from
infallible
instinct
,
would
always
prefer
oats
to
wheat
,
as
appeared
from
experience
;
for
,
in
a
place
where
there
was
a
parcel
of
each
,
that
animal
had
never
begun
to
feed
upon
the
latter
till
all
the
oats
were
consumed
;
for
their
nutritive
quality
,
he
appealed
to
the
hale
,
robust
constitutions
of
the
people
who
lived
chiefly
upon
oat
-
meal
;
and
,
instead
of
being
inflammatory
,
he
asserted
,
that
it
was
a
cooling
sub
-
acid
,
balsamic
and
mucilaginous
;
insomuch
,
that
in
all
inflammatory
distempers
,
recourse
was
had
to
water
-
gruel
,
and
flummery
made
of
oatmeal
.
    
<EOS>
"
At
least
(
said
I
)
give
me
leave
to
wish
them
such
a
degree
of
commerce
as
may
enable
them
to
follow
their
own
inclinations
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forbid
!
<EOS>
(
cried
this
philosopher
)
<EOS>
Woe
be
to
that
nation
,
where
the
multitude
is
at
liberty
to
follow
their
own
inclinations
!
<EOS>
Commerce
is
undoubtedly
a
blessing
,
while
restrained
within
its
proper
channels
;
but
a
glut
of
wealth
brings
along
with
it
a
glut
of
evils
;
it
brings
false
taste
,
false
appetite
,
false
wants
,
profusion
,
venality
,
contempt
of
order
,
engendering
a
spirit
of
licentiousness
,
insolence
,
and
faction
<EOS>
,
that
keeps
the
community
in
continual
ferment
,
and
in
time
destroys
all
the
distinctions
of
civil
society
;
so
that
universal
anarchy
and
uproar
must
ensue
.
<EOS>
Will
any
sensible
man
affirm
,
that
the
national
advantages
of
opulence
are
to
be
sought
on
these
terms
?
<EOS>
No
,
sure
;
but
I
am
one
of
those
,
who
think
,
that
,
by
proper
regulations
,
commerce
may
produce
every
national
benefit
,
without
the
allay
of
such
concomitant
evils
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
dogmata
of
my
friend
Lismahago
,
whom
I
describe
the
more
circumstantially
as
I
firmly
believe
he
will
set
up
his
rest
in
Monmouthshire
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
while
I
was
alone
with
him
,
he
asked
,
in
some
confusion
,
if
I
should
have
any
objection
to
the
success
of
a
gentleman
and
soldier
,
provided
he
should
be
so
fortunate
as
to
engage
my
sister
's
affection
.
<EOS>
I
answered
,
without
hesitation
,
that
my
sister
was
old
enough
to
judge
for
herself
;
and
that
I
should
be
very
far
from
disapproving
any
resolution
she
might
take
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
His
eyes
sparkled
at
this
declaration
.
<EOS>
He
declared
,
he
should
think
himself
the
happiest
man
on
earth
to
be
connected
with
my
family
;
and
that
he
should
never
be
weary
of
giving
me
proofs
of
his
gratitude
and
attachment
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Tabby
and
he
are
already
agreed
;
in
which
case
,
we
shall
have
a
wedding
at
Brambleton
-
hall
,
and
you
shall
give
away
the
bride
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
the
least
thing
you
can
do
,
by
way
of
atonement
for
your
former
cruelty
to
that
poor
love
-
sick
maiden
,
who
has
been
so
long
a
thorn
in
the
side
of
    
Yours

been

not
much
relish
either
the

DEAR
WAT

ADVENTURES
begin

we
advance
to

<EOS>
Lismahago
has
now
professed
himself
the
admirer
of

carries
on
his
addresses
under
the

we
shall
certainly
have
a
wedding
by
Christmas
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
you
was
present
at
the
nuptials
,
to
help
me
to
throw
the
stocking
,
and
perform
other
ceremonies
peculiar
to
that
occasion
  
<EOS>
I
am
sure
it
will
be
productive
of
some
diversion
;
and
,
truly
,
it
would
be
worth
your
while
to
come
across
the
country
on
purpose
to
see
two
such
original
figures
in
bed
together
,
with
their
laced
night
-
caps
;
he
,
the
emblem
of
good
cheer
,
and
she
,
the
picture
of
good
-
nature
.
<EOS>
All
this
agreeable
prospect
was
clouded
,
and
had
well
nigh
vanished
entirely
,
in
consequence
of
a
late
misunderstanding
between
the
future
brothers
-
in
-
law
,
which
,
however
,
is
now
happily
removed
.
    
<EOS>
A
few
days
ago
,
my
uncle
and
I
,
going
to
visit
a
relation
,
met
with
lord
Oxmington
at
his
house
,
who
asked
us
to
dine
with
him
next
day
,
and
we
accepted
the
invitation
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
leaving
our
women
under
he
case
of
captain
Lismahago
,
at
the
inn
where
we
had
loged
the
preceding
night
,
in
a
little
town
,
about
a
mile
from
his
lordship
's
dwelling
,
we
went
at
the
hour
appointed
,
and
had
a
fashionable
meal
served
up
with
much
ostentation
to
a
company
of
about
a
dozen
persons
,
none
of
whom
we
had
ever
seen
before
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
is
much
more
remarkable
for
his
pride
and
caprice
,
than
for
his
hospitality
and
understanding
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
appeared
,
that
he
considered
his
guests
merely
as
objects
to
shine
upon
,
so
as
to
reflect
the
lustre
of
his
own
magnificence
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
much
state
,
but
no
courtesy
;
and
a
great
deal
of
compliment
without
any
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
desert
was
removed
,
our
noble
entertainer
proposed
three
general
toasts
;
then
calling
for
a
glass
of
wine
,
and
bowing
all
round
,
wished
us
a
good
afternoon
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
signal
for
the
company
to
break
up
,
and
they
obeyed
it
immediately
,
all
except
our
"
squire
,
who
was
greatly
shocked
at
the
manner
of
this
dismission
.
  
<EOS>
He
changed
countenance
,
bit
his
lips
in
silence
,
but
still
kept
his
seat
,
so
that
his
lordship
found
himself
obliged
to
give
us
another
hint
,
by
saying
,
he
should
be
glad
to
see
us
another
time
,
"
there
is
no
time
like
the
time
present
<EOS>
(
cried
Mr
Bramble
)
;
your
lordship
has
not
yet
drank
a
bumper
to
the
best
in
Christendom
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
'll
drink
no
more
bumpers
to
-
day
(
answered
our
landlord
)
;
and
I
am
sorry
to
see
you
have
drank
too
many
.
  
<EOS>
Order
the
gentleman
's
carriage
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
rose
and
retired
abruptly
;
our
"
squire
starting
up
at
the
same
time
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
eying
him
with
a
most
ferocious
aspect
.
<EOS>
The
master
having
vanished
in
this
manner
,
our
uncle
bad
one
of
the
servants
to
see
what
was
to
pay
;
and
the
fellow
answering
,
"
This
is
no
inn
,
"
"
I
cry
you
mercy
,
(
cried
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
it
is
not
;
if
it
were
,
the
landlord
would
be
more
civil
.
  
<EOS>
There
's
a
guinea
,
however
;
take
it
,
and
tell
your
lord
,
that
I
shall
not
leave
the
country
till
I
have
had
an
opportunity
to
thank
him
in
person
for
his
politeness
and
hospitality
.
"
    
<EOS>
We
then
walked
down
stairs
through
a
double
range
of
lacqueys
,
and
getting
into
the
chaise
,
proceeded
homewards
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
the
"
squire
much
ruffled
,
I
ventured
to
disapprove
of
his
resentment
,
observing
,
that
as
lord
Oxmington
was
well
known
to
have
his
brain
very
ill
timbered
,
a
sensible
man
should
rather
laugh
,
than
be
angry
at
his
ridiculous
want
of
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
took
umbrage
at
my
presuming
to
be
wiser
than
he
upon
this
occasion
;
and
told
me
,
that
as
he
had
always
thought
for
himself
in
every
occurrence
in
life
,
he
would
still
use
the
same
privilege
,
with
my
good
leave
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
returned
to
our
inn
,
he
closetted
Lismahago
;
and
having
explained
his
grievance
,
desired
that
gentleman
to
go
and
demand
satisfaction
of
lord
Oxmington
in
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
charged
himself
with
this
commission
,
and
immediately
set
out
a
horseback
for
his
lordship
's
house
attended
,
at
his
own
request
,
by
my
man
Archy
Macalpine
,
who
had
been
used
to
military
service
;
and
truly
,
if
Macalpine
had
been
mounted
upon
an
ass
,
this
couple
might
have
passed
for
the
knight
of
La
Mancha
and
his
"
squire
Panza
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
after
some
demur
that
Lismahago
obtained
a
private
audience
,
at
which
he
formally
defied
his
lordship
to
single
combat
,
in
the
name
of
Mr
Bramble
,
and
desired
him
to
appoint
the
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
Lord
Oxmington
was
so
confounded
at
this
unexpected
message
,
that
he
could
not
,
for
some
time
,
make
any
articulate
reply
;
but
stood
staring
at
the
lieutenant
with
manifest
marks
of
perturbation
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
ringing
a
bell
with
great
vehemence
,
he
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
a
commoner
send
a
challenge
to
a
peer
of
the
realm
!
  
<EOS>
Privilege
!
privilege
!
  
<EOS>
Here
's
a
person
brings
me
a
challenge
from
the
Welchman
that
dined
at
my
table
 
<EOS>
An
impudent
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
My
wine
is
not
yet
out
of
his
head
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
whole
house
was
immediately
in
commotion
.
  
<EOS>
Macalpine
made
a
soldierly
retreat
with
the
two
horses
;
but
the
captain
was
suddenly
surrounded
and
disarmed
by
the
footmen
,
whom
a
French
valet
de
chambre
headed
in
this
exploit
;
his
sword
was
passed
through
a
close
-
stool
,
and
his
person
through
the
horse
pond
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
plight
he
returned
to
the
inn
,
half
mad
with
his
disgrace
.
  
<EOS>
So
violent
was
the
rage
of
his
indignation
,
that
he
mistook
its
object
  
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
quarrel
with
Mr
Bramble
;
he
said
,
he
had
been
dishonoured
on
his
account
,
and
he
looked
for
reparation
at
his
hands
.
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
's
back
was
up
in
a
moment
;
and
he
desired
him
to
explain
his
pretensions
  
"
Either
compel
lord
Oxmington
to
give
me
satisfaction
,
(
cried
he
)
or
give
it
me
in
your
own
person
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
latter
part
of
the
alternative
is
the
most
easy
and
expeditious
(
replied
the
"
squire
,
starting
up
)
:
if
you
are
disposed
for
a
walk
,
I
'll
attend
you
this
moment
.
"
    
<EOS>
Here
they
were
interrupted
by
Mrs
Tabby
,
who
had
overhead
all
that
passed
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
burst
into
the
room
,
and
running
betwixt
them
,
in
great
agitation
,
"
Is
this
your
regard
for
me
,
(
said
she
to
the
lieutenant
)
to
seek
the
life
of
my
brother
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lismahago
,
who
seemed
to
grow
cool
as
my
uncle
grew
hot
,
assured
her
he
had
a
very
great
respect
for
Mr
Bramble
,
but
he
had
still
more
for
his
own
honour
,
which
had
suffered
pollution
;
but
if
that
could
be
once
purified
,
he
should
have
no
further
cause
of
dissatisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
squire
said
,
he
should
have
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
vindicate
the
lieutenant
's
honour
;
but
,
as
he
had
now
carved
for
himself
,
he
might
swallow
and
digest
it
as
well
as
he
could
 
in
a
word
,
what
betwixt
the
meditation
of
Mrs
Tabitha
,
the
recollection
of
the
captain
,
who
perceived
he
had
gone
too
far
,
and
the
remonstrances
if
your
humble
servant
,
who
joined
them
at
this
juncture
,
those
two
originals
were
perfectly
reconciled
;
and
then
we
proceeded
to
deliberate
upon
the
means
of
taking
vengeance
for
the
insults
they
had
received
from
the
petulent
peer
;
for
,
until
that
aim
should
be
accomplished
,
Mr
Bramble
swore
,
with
great
emphasis
,
that
he
would
not
leave
the
inn
where
we
now
lodged
,
even
if
he
should
pass
his
Christmas
on
the
spot
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
our
deliberations
,
we
next
day
,
in
the
forenoon
,
proceeded
in
a
body
to
his
lordship
's
house
,
all
of
us
,
with
our
servants
,
including
the
coachman
,
mounted
a
horseback
,
with
our
pistols
loaded
and
ready
primed
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
prepared
for
action
,
we
paraded
solemnly
and
slowly
before
his
lordship
's
gate
,
which
we
passed
three
times
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
could
not
but
see
us
,
and
suspect
the
cause
of
our
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
After
dinner
we
returned
,
and
performed
the
same
cavalcade
,
which
was
again
repeated
the
morning
following
;
but
we
had
no
occasion
to
persist
in
these
manoeuvres
.
  
<EOS>
About
noon
,
we
were
visited
by
the
gentleman
,
at
whose
house
we
had
first
seen
lord
Oxmington
.
  
<EOS>
He
now
came
to
make
apologies
in
the
name
of
his
lordship
,
who
declared
he
had
no
intention
to
give
offence
to
my
uncle
in
practising
what
had
been
always
the
custom
of
his
house
;
and
that
as
for
the
indignities
which
had
been
put
upon
the
officer
,
they
were
offered
without
his
lordship
's
knowledge
,
at
the
instigation
of
his
valet
de
chambre
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
,
(
said
my
uncle
in
a
peremptory
tone
)
<EOS>
I
shall
be
contented
with
lord
Oxmington
's
personal
excuses
;
and
I
hope
my
friend
will
be
satisfied
with
his
lordship
's
turning
that
insolent
rascal
out
of
his
service
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sir
(
cried
Lismahago
)
<EOS>
I
must
insist
upon
taking
personal
vengeance
for
the
personal
injuries
I
have
sustained
.
"
    
<EOS>
After
some
debate
,
the
affair
was
adjusted
in
this
manner
.
  
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
meeting
us
at
our
friend
's
house
,
declared
he
was
sorry
for
what
had
happened
;
and
that
he
had
no
intention
to
give
umbrage
  
<EOS>
The
valet
de
chambre
asked
pardon
of
the
lieutenant
upon
his
knees
,
when
Lismahago
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
present
,
gave
him
a
violent
kick
on
the
face
,
which
laid
him
on
his
back
,
exclaimed
in
a
furious
tone
,
"
Oui
je
te
pardome
,
gens
foutre
.
"
    
<EOS>
Such
was
the
fortunate
issue
of
this
perilous
adventure
,
which
threatened
abundance
of
vexation
to
our
family
;
for
the
"
squire
is
one
of
those
who
will
sacrifice
both
life
and
fortune
,
rather
than
leave
what
they
conceive
to
be
the
least
speck
or
blemish
upon
their
honour
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
had
no
sooner
pronounced
his
apology
,
with
a
very
bad
grace
,
than
he
went
away
in
some
disorder
,
and
,
I
dare
say
,
he
will
never
invite
another
Welchman
to
his
table
.
    
<EOS>
We
forthwith
quitted
the
field
of
this
atchievement
,
in
order
to
prosecute
our
journey
;
but
we
follow
no
determinate
course
  
<EOS>
We
make
small
deviations
,
to
see
the
remarkable
towns
,
villas
,
and
curiosities
on
each
side
of
our
route
;
so
that
we
advance
by
slow
steps
towards
the
borders
of
Monmouthshire
:
<EOS>
but
in
the
midst
of
these
irregular
motions
,
there
is
no
abberration
nor
eccentricity
in
that
affection
with
which
I
am
,
dear
Wat
,
    
Yours
always
,
J
Melford

To

<EOS>
DEAR
DICK
,
<EOS>
AT
what
time
of
life
may
a
man
think
himself
exempted
from
the
necessity
of
sacrificing
his
repose
to
the
punctilios
of
a
contemptible
world
?
<EOS>
I
have
been
engaged
in
a
ridiculous
adventure
,
which
I
shall
recount
at
meeting
;
and
this
,
I
hope
,
will
not
be
much
longer
delayed
,
as
we
have
now
performed
almost
all
our
visits
,
and
seen
every
thing
that
I
think
has
any
right
to
retard
us
in
our
journey
homewards
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
ago
,
understanding
by
accident
,
that
my
old
friend
Baynard
was
in
the
country
,
I
would
not
pass
so
near
his
habitation
without
paying
him
a
visit
,
though
our
correspondence
had
been
interrupted
for
a
long
course
of
years
.
    
<EOS>
I
felt
myself
very
sensibly
affected
by
the
ideas
of
our
past
intimacy
,
as
we
approached
the
place
where
we
had
spent
so
many
happy
days
together
;
but
when
we
arrived
at
the
house
,
I
could
not
recognize
any
one
of
those
objects
,
which
had
been
so
deeply
impressed
upon
my
remembrance
  
<EOS>
The
tall
oaks
that
shaded
the
avenue
,
had
been
cut
down
,
and
the
iron
gates
at
the
end
of
it
removed
,
together
with
the
high
wall
that
surrounded
the
court
yard
.
<EOS>
The
house
itself
,
which
was
formerly
a
convent
of
Cistercian
monks
,
had
a
venerable
appearance
;
and
along
the
front
that
looked
into
the
garden
,
was
a
stone
gallery
,
which
afforded
me
many
an
agreeable
walk
,
when
I
was
disposed
to
be
contemplative
  
<EOS>
Now
the
old
front
is
covered
with
a
screen
of
modern
architecture
;
so
that
all
without
is
Grecian
,
and
all
within
Gothic
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
garden
,
which
was
well
stocked
with
the
best
fruit
which
England
could
produce
,
there
is
not
now
the
least
vestige
remaining
of
trees
,
walls
,
or
hedges
  
<EOS>
Nothing
appears
but
a
naked
circus
of
loose
sand
,
with
a
dry
bason
and
a
leaden
Triton
in
the
middle
.
    
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
that
Baynard
,
at
his
father
's
death
,
had
a
clear
estate
of
fifteen
hundred
pounds
a
-
year
,
and
was
in
other
respects
extremely
well
qualified
to
make
a
respectable
figure
in
the
commonwealth
;
but
,
what
with
some
excesses
of
youth
,
and
the
expence
of
a
contested
election
,
he
in
a
few
years
found
himself
encumbered
with
a
debt
of
ten
thousand
pounds
,
which
he
resolved
to
discharge
by
means
of
a
prudent
marriage
  
<EOS>
He
accordingly
married
a
miss
Thompson
,
whose
fortune
amounted
to
double
the
sum
that
he
owed
  
<EOS>
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
citizen
,
who
had
failed
in
trade
;
but
her
fortune
came
by
an
uncle
,
who
died
in
the
East
-
Indies
  
Her
own
parents
being
dead
,
she
lived
with
a
maiden
aunt
,
who
had
superintended
her
education
;
and
,
in
all
appearance
,
was
well
enough
qualified
for
the
usual
porposes
of
the
married
state
  
<EOS>
Her
virtues
,
however
,
stood
rather
upon
a
negative
;
than
a
positive
foundation
  
<EOS>
She
was
neither
proud
,
insolent
,
nor
capricious
,
nor
given
to
scandal
,
nor
addicted
to
gaming
,
nor
inclined
to
gallantry
  
She
could
read
,
and
write
,
and
dance
,
and
sing
,
and
play
upon
the
harpsichord
,
and
smatter
French
,
and
take
a
hand
at
whist
and
ombre
;
but
even
these
accomplishments
she
possessed
by
halves
  
<EOS>
She
excelled
in
nothing
.
<EOS>
Her
conversation
was
flat
,
her
stile
mean
,
and
her
expression
embarrassed
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
her
character
was
totally
insipid
.
<EOS>
Her
person
was
not
disagreeable
;
but
there
was
nothing
graceful
in
her
address
,
nor
engaging
in
her
manners
;
and
she
was
so
ill
qualified
to
do
the
honours
of
the
house
,
that
when
she
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
one
was
always
looking
for
the
mistress
of
the
family
in
some
other
place
.
    
<EOS>
Baynard
had
flattered
himself
that
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
mould
such
a
subject
after
his
own
fashion
,
and
that
she
would
chearfully
enter
into
his
views
,
which
were
wholly
turned
to
domestic
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
to
reside
always
in
the
country
,
of
which
he
was
fond
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
to
cultivate
his
estate
,
which
was
very
improvable
;
to
enjoy
the
exercise
of
rural
diversions
;
to
maintain
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
with
some
friends
that
were
settled
in
his
neighbourhood
;
to
keep
a
comfortable
house
,
without
suffering
his
expence
to
exceed
the
limits
of
his
income
:
and
to
find
pleasure
and
employment
for
his
wife
in
the
management
and
avocations
of
her
own
family
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
a
visionary
scheme
,
which
he
never
was
able
to
realize
.
<EOS>
His
wife
was
as
ignorant
as
a
new
-
born
babe
of
every
thing
that
related
to
the
conduct
of
a
family
;
and
she
had
no
idea
of
a
country
life
  
<EOS>
Her
understanding
did
not
reach
so
far
as
to
comprehend
the
first
principles
of
discretion
;
and
,
indeed
,
if
her
capacity
had
been
better
than
it
was
,
her
natural
indolence
would
not
have
permitted
her
to
abandon
a
certain
routine
,
to
which
she
had
been
habituated
.
<EOS>
she
had
not
taste
enough
to
relish
any
national
enjoyment
;
but
her
ruiling
passion
was
vanity
,
not
that
species
which
arises
from
self
-
conceit
of
superior
accomplishments
,
but
that
which
is
of
a
bastard
and
idiot
nature
,
excited
by
shew
and
ostentation
,
which
implies
not
even
the
least
consciousness
of
any
personal
merit
.
    
<EOS>
The
nuptial
peale
of
noise
and
nonsense
being
rung
out
in
all
the
usual
changes
<EOS>
,
Mr
Baynard
thought
it
high
time
to
make
her
acquainted
with
the
particulars
of
the
plan
which
he
had
projected
  
<EOS>
He
told
her
that
his
fortune
,
though
sufficient
to
afford
all
the
comforts
of
life
,
was
not
ample
enough
to
command
all
the
superfluities
of
pomp
and
pageantry
,
which
,
indeed
,
were
equally
absurd
and
intolerable
  
<EOS>
He
therefore
hoped
she
would
have
no
objection
to
their
leaving
London
in
the
spring
,
when
he
would
take
the
opportunity
to
dismiss
some
unnecessary
domestics
,
whom
he
had
hired
for
the
occasion
of
their
marriage
  
<EOS>
She
heard
him
in
silence
,
and
after
some
pause
,
"
<EOS>
So
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
buried
in
the
country
!
"
<EOS>
He
was
so
confounded
at
this
reply
,
that
he
could
not
speak
for
some
minutes
:
at
length
he
told
her
he
was
much
mortified
to
find
he
had
proposed
any
thing
that
was
disagreeable
to
her
ideas
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
(
added
he
)
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
more
than
to
lay
down
a
comfortable
plan
of
living
within
the
bounds
of
our
fortune
,
which
is
but
moderate
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
you
are
the
best
judge
of
your
own
affairs
  
<EOS>
My
fortune
,
I
know
,
does
not
exceed
twenty
thousand
pounds
  
<EOS>
Yet
,
even
with
that
pittance
,
I
might
have
had
a
husband
who
would
not
have
begrudged
me
a
house
in
London
 
"
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
(
cried
poor
Baynard
,
in
the
utmost
agitation
)
<EOS>
you
do
n't
think
me
so
sordid
  
<EOS>
I
only
hinted
what
I
thought
  
<EOS>
But
,
I
do
n't
pretend
to
impose
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
,
(
resumed
the
lady
)
<EOS>
it
is
your
prerogative
to
command
,
and
my
duty
to
obey
 
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
burst
into
tears
and
retired
to
her
chamber
,
where
she
was
joined
by
her
aunt
  
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
to
recollect
himself
,
and
act
with
vigour
of
mind
on
this
occasion
;
but
was
betrayed
by
the
tenderness
of
his
nature
,
which
was
the
greatest
defect
of
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
aunt
in
tears
,
and
the
niece
in
a
fit
,
which
held
her
the
best
part
of
eight
hours
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
she
began
to
talk
incoherently
about
death
and
her
dear
husband
,
who
had
sat
by
her
all
this
time
,
and
now
pressed
her
hand
to
his
lips
,
in
a
transport
of
grief
and
penitance
for
the
offence
he
had
given
  
From
thence
forward
,
he
carefully
avoided
mentioning
the
country
;
and
they
continued
to
be
sucked
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
vortex
of
extravagance
and
dissipation
,
leading
what
is
called
a
fashionable
life
in
town
  
About
the
latter
end
of
July
,
however
,
Mrs
Baynard
,
in
order
to
exhibit
a
proof
of
conjugal
obedience
,
desired
of
her
own
accord
,
that
they
might
pay
a
visit
to
his
country
house
,
as
there
was
no
company
left
in
London
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
excused
himself
from
this
excursion
,
which
was
no
part
of
the
oeconomical
plan
he
had
proposed
;
but
she
insisted
upon
making
this
sacrifice
to
his
taste
and
prejudices
,
and
away
they
went
with
such
an
equipage
as
astonished
the
whole
country
  
<EOS>
All
that
remained
of
the
season
was
engrossed
by
receiving
and
returning
visits
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
,
in
this
intercourse
,
it
was
discovered
that
sir
John
Chickwell
had
a
house
-
steward
and
one
footman
in
livery
more
than
the
complement
of
Mr
Baynard
's
household
.
<EOS>
This
remark
was
made
by
the
aunt
at
table
,
and
assented
to
by
the
husband
,
who
observed
that
sir
John
Chickwell
might
very
well
afford
to
keep
more
servants
than
were
found
in
the
family
of
a
man
who
had
not
half
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Baynard
eat
no
supper
that
evening
;
but
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
which
completed
her
triumph
over
the
spirit
of
her
consort
.
<EOS>
The
two
supernumerary
servants
were
added
  
The
family
plate
was
sold
for
old
silver
,
and
a
new
service
procured
;
fashionable
furniture
was
provided
,
and
the
whole
house
turned
topsy
turvy
.
    
<EOS>
At
their
return
to
London
,
in
the
beginning
of
winter
,
he
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
communicated
these
particulars
to
me
in
confidence
.
<EOS>
Before
his
marriage
,
he
had
introduced
me
to
the
lady
as
his
particular
friend
;
and
I
now
offered
in
that
character
,
to
lay
before
her
the
necessity
of
reforming
her
oeconomy
,
if
she
had
any
regard
to
the
interest
of
her
own
family
,
or
complaisance
for
the
inclinations
of
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
But
Baynard
declined
my
offer
,
on
the
supposition
that
his
wife
's
nerves
were
to
delicate
to
bear
expostulation
;
and
that
it
would
only
serve
to
overwhelm
her
with
such
distress
as
would
make
himself
miserable
.
<EOS>
Baynard
is
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
had
she
proved
a
termagant
,
he
would
have
known
how
to
deal
with
her
;
but
either
by
accident
or
instinct
,
she
fastened
upon
the
weak
side
of
his
soul
,
and
held
it
so
fast
,
that
he
has
been
in
subjection
ever
since
  
I
afterwards
advised
him
to
carry
her
abroad
to
France
or
Italy
,
where
he
might
gratify
her
vanity
for
half
the
expence
it
cost
him
in
England
;
and
this
advice
he
followed
accordingly
  
<EOS>
She
was
agreeably
flattered
with
the
idea
of
seeing
and
knowing
foreign
parts
,
and
foreign
fashions
;
of
being
presented
to
sovereigns
,
and
living
familiarly
with
princes
.
<EOS>
She
forthwith
seized
the
hint
which
I
had
thrown
out
on
purpose
,
and
even
pressed
Mr
Baynard
to
hasten
his
departure
;
so
that
in
a
few
weeks
they
crossed
the
sea
to
France
,
with
a
moderate
train
,
<EOS>
still
including
the
aunt
;
who
was
her
bosom
counsellor
,
and
abetted
her
in
all
her
opposition
to
her
husband
's
<EOS>
will
  
<EOS>
Since
that
period
,
I
have
had
little
or
no
opportunity
to
renew
our
former
correspondence
  
All
that
I
knew
of
his
transactions
,
amounted
to
no
more
than
that
after
an
absence
of
two
years
,
they
returned
so
little
improved
in
oeconomy
,
that
they
launched
out
into
a
new
ocean
of
extravagance
,
which
,
at
length
,
obliged
him
to
mortgage
his
estate
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
she
had
bore
him
three
children
,
of
which
the
last
only
survives
,
a
puny
boy
of
twelve
or
thirteen
,
who
will
be
ruined
in
his
education
by
the
indulgence
of
his
mother
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
Baynard
,
neither
his
own
good
sense
,
nor
the
dread
of
indigence
,
nor
the
consideration
of
his
children
,
has
been
of
force
sufficient
to
stimulate
him
into
the
resolution
of
breaking
at
once
the
shameful
spell
by
which
he
seems
enchanted
  
With
a
taste
capable
of
the
most
refined
enjoyment
,
a
heart
glowing
with
all
the
warmth
of
friendship
and
humanity
,
and
<EOS>
a
disposition
strongly
turned
to
the
more
rational
pleasures
of
a
retired
and
country
life
,
he
is
hurried
about
in
a
perpetual
tumult
,
amidst
a
mob
of
beings
pleased
with
rattles
,
baubles
,
and
gew
-
gaws
,
so
void
of
sense
and
distinction
,
that
even
the
most
acute
philosophy
would
find
it
a
very
hard
task
to
discover
for
what
wise
purpose
of
providence
they
were
created
  
<EOS>
Friendship
is
not
to
be
found
;
nor
can
the
amusements
for
which
he
sighs
be
enjoyed
within
the
rotation
of
absurdity
,
to
which
he
is
doomed
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
has
long
resigned
all
views
of
improving
his
fortune
by
management
and
attention
to
the
exercise
of
husbandry
,
in
which
he
delighted
;
and
as
to
domestic
happiness
,
not
the
least
glimpse
of
hope
remains
to
amuse
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
Thus
blasted
in
all
his
prospects
,
he
could
not
fail
to
be
overwhelmed
with
melancholy
and
chagrin
,
which
have
preyed
upon
his
health
and
spirits
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
is
now
threatened
with
a
consumption
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
a
sketch
of
the
man
,
whom
the
other
day
I
went
to
visit
  
<EOS>
At
the
gate
we
found
a
great
number
of
powdered
lacquies
,
but
no
civility
  
<EOS>
After
we
had
sat
a
considerable
time
in
the
coach
,
we
were
told
,
that
Mr
Baynard
had
rode
out
,
and
that
his
lady
was
dressing
;
but
we
were
introduced
to
a
parlour
,
so
very
fine
and
delicate
,
that
in
all
appearance
it
was
designed
to
be
seen
only
,
not
inhabited
.
<EOS>
The
chairs
and
couches
were
carved
,
gilt
,
and
covered
with
rich
damask
,
so
smooth
and
sleek
,
that
they
looked
as
if
they
had
never
been
sat
upon
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
carpet
on
the
floor
;
but
the
boards
were
rubbed
and
waxed
in
such
a
manner
,
that
we
could
not
walk
,
but
were
obliged
to
slide
along
them
;
and
as
for
the
stove
,
it
was
too
bright
and
polished
to
be
polluted
with
sea
-
coal
,
or
stained
by
the
smoke
of
any
gross
material
fire
  
<EOS>
When
we
had
remained
above
half
an
hour
sacrificing
to
the
inhospitable
powers
in
this
temple
of
cold
reception
,
my
friend
Baynard
arrived
,
and
understanding
we
were
in
the
house
,
made
his
appearance
,
so
meagre
,
yellow
,
and
dejected
that
I
really
should
not
have
known
him
,
had
I
met
with
him
in
any
other
place
  
Running
up
to
me
,
with
great
eagerness
,
he
strained
me
in
his
embrace
,
and
his
heart
was
so
full
,
that
for
some
minutes
he
could
not
speak
  
Having
saluted
us
all
round
,
he
perceived
our
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
conducting
us
into
another
apartment
,
which
had
fire
in
the
chimney
,
called
for
chocolate
  
<EOS>
Then
,
withdrawing
,
he
returned
with
a
compliment
from
his
wife
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
presented
his
son
Harry
,
a
shambling
,
blear
-
eyed
boy
,
in
the
habit
of
a
hussar
;
very
rude
,
forward
,
and
impertinent
  
His
father
would
have
sent
him
to
a
boarding
-
school
,
but
his
mamma
and
aunt
would
not
hear
of
his
lying
out
of
the
house
;
so
that
there
was
a
clergyman
engaged
as
his
tutor
in
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
As
it
was
but
just
turned
of
twelve
,
and
the
whole
house
was
in
commotion
to
prepare
a
formal
entertainment
,
I
forsaw
it
would
be
late
before
we
dined
,
and
propsed
a
walk
to
Mr
Baynard
,
that
we
might
converse
together
freely
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
perambulation
,
when
I
expressed
some
surprise
that
he
had
returned
so
soon
from
Italy
,
he
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
his
going
abroad
had
not
at
all
answered
the
purpose
for
which
he
left
England
;
that
although
the
expence
of
living
was
not
so
great
in
Italy
as
at
home
,
respect
being
had
to
the
same
rank
of
life
in
both
countries
,
it
had
been
found
necessary
for
him
to
lift
himself
above
his
usual
stile
,
that
he
might
be
on
some
footing
with
the
counts
,
marquises
,
and
cavalieres
,
with
whom
he
kept
company
  
<EOS>
He
was
obliged
to
hire
a
great
number
of
servants
,
to
take
off
a
great
variety
of
rich
cloaths
,
and
to
keep
a
sumptuous
table
for
the
fashionable
scorocconi
of
the
country
;
who
,
without
a
consideration
of
this
kind
,
would
not
have
payed
any
attention
to
an
untitled
foreigner
,
let
his
family
or
fortune
be
ever
so
respectable
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
Mrs
Baynard
was
continually
surrounded
by
a
train
of
expensive
loungers
,
under
the
denominations
of
language
-
masters
,
musicians
,
painters
,
and
ciceroni
;
and
had
actually
fallen
into
the
disease
of
buying
pictures
and
antiques
upon
her
own
judgment
,
which
was
far
from
being
infallible
  
<EOS>
At
length
she
met
with
an
affront
,
which
gave
her
a
disgust
to
Italy
,
and
drove
her
back
to
England
with
some
precipitation
.
<EOS>
By
means
of
frequenting
the
dutchess
of
B
#
#
#
#
's
conversazione
,
while
her
grace
was
at
Rome
Mrs
Baynard
became
acquainted
with
all
the
fashionable
people
of
that
city
,
and
was
admitted
to
their
assemblies
without
scruple
  
<EOS>
Thus
favoured
,
she
conceived
too
great
an
idea
of
her
own
importance
,
and
when
the
dutchess
left
Rome
,
resolved
to
have
a
conversazione
that
should
leave
the
Romans
no
room
to
regret
her
grace
's
departure
.
<EOS>
She
provided
hands
for
a
musical
entertainment
,
and
sent
bighetti
of
invitation
to
every
person
of
distinction
;
but
not
one
Roman
of
the
female
sex
appeared
at
her
assembly
  
<EOS>
She
was
that
night
seized
with
a
violent
fit
,
and
kept
her
bed
three
days
,
<EOS>
at
the
expiration
of
which
she
declared
that
the
air
of
Italy
would
be
the
ruin
of
her
constitution
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
prevent
this
catastrophe
,
she
was
speedily
removed
to
Geneva
,
from
whence
they
returned
to
England
by
the
way
of
Lyons
and
Paris
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
arrived
at
Calais
,
she
had
purchased
such
a
quantity
of
silks
,
stuffs
,
and
laces
,
that
it
was
necessary
to
hire
a
vessel
to
smuggle
them
over
,
and
this
vessel
was
taken
by
a
custom
-
house
cutter
;
so
that
they
lost
the
whole
cargo
,
which
had
cost
them
above
eight
hundred
pounds
.
    
<EOS>
It
now
appeared
,
that
her
travels
had
produced
no
effect
upon
her
,
but
that
of
making
her
more
expensive
and
fantastic
than
ever
:
  
She
affected
to
lead
the
fashion
,
not
only
in
point
of
female
dress
,
but
in
every
article
of
taste
and
connoisseurship
.
<EOS>
She
made
a
drawing
of
the
new
facade
to
the
house
in
the
country
;
she
pulled
up
the
trees
,
and
pulled
down
the
walls
of
the
garden
,
so
as
to
let
in
the
easterly
wind
,
which
Mr
Baynard
's
ancestors
had
been
at
great
pains
to
exclude
.
<EOS>
To
shew
her
taste
in
laying
out
ground
,
she
seized
in
-
into
her
own
hand
a
farm
of
two
hundred
acres
,
about
a
mile
from
the
house
,
which
she
parcelled
out
into
walks
and
shrubberies
,
having
a
great
bason
in
the
middle
,
into
which
she
poured
a
whole
stream
that
turned
two
mills
,
and
afforded
the
best
trout
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
The
bottom
of
the
bason
,
however
,
was
so
ill
secured
,
that
it
would
not
hold
the
water
which
strained
through
the
earth
,
and
made
a
bog
of
the
whole
plantation
:
in
a
word
,
the
ground
,
which
formerly
payed
him
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
a
year
,
now
cost
him
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
keep
in
it
tolerable
order
,
over
and
above
the
first
expence
of
trees
,
shrubs
,
flowers
,
turf
,
and
gravel
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
an
inch
of
garden
ground
left
about
the
house
,
nor
a
tree
that
produced
fruit
of
any
kind
;
nor
did
he
raise
a
truss
of
hay
,
or
a
bushel
of
oats
for
his
horses
,
nor
had
he
a
single
cow
to
afford
him
milk
for
his
tea
;
far
less
did
he
ever
dream
of
feeding
his
own
mutton
,
pigs
,
and
poultry
:
every
article
of
house
-
keeping
,
even
the
most
inconsiderable
,
was
brought
from
the
next
market
town
,
at
the
distance
of
five
miles
,
and
<EOS>
thither
they
sent
a
courier
every
morning
to
fetch
hot
rolls
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Baynard
fairly
owned
that
he
spent
double
his
income
,
and
that
in
a
few
years
he
should
be
obliged
to
sell
his
estate
for
the
payment
of
his
creditors
.
<EOS>
He
said
his
wife
had
such
delicate
nerves
,
and
such
imbecility
of
spirit
,
that
she
could
neither
bear
remonstrance
,
be
it
ever
so
gentle
,
nor
practise
any
scheme
of
retrenchment
,
even
if
she
perceived
the
necessity
of
such
a
measure
.
<EOS>
He
had
therefore
ceased
struggling
against
the
stream
,
and
endeavoured
to
reconcile
himself
to
ruin
,
by
reflecting
that
his
child
,
at
least
,
would
inherit
his
mother
's
fortune
,
which
was
secured
to
him
by
the
contract
of
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
The
detail
which
he
gave
me
of
his
affairs
,
filled
me
at
once
with
grief
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
I
inveighed
bitterly
against
the
indiscretion
of
his
wife
,
and
reproached
him
with
his
unmanly
acquiescence
under
the
absurd
tyranny
which
she
exerted
.
<EOS>
I
exhorted
him
to
recollect
his
resolution
,
and
make
one
effectual
effort
to
disengage
himself
from
a
thraldom
,
equally
shameful
and
pernicious
.
<EOS>
I
offered
him
all
the
assistance
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
I
undertook
to
regulate
his
affairs
,
and
even
to
bring
about
a
reformation
in
his
family
,
if
he
would
only
authorise
me
to
execute
the
plan
I
should
form
for
his
advantage
.
<EOS>
I
was
so
effected
by
the
subject
,
that
I
could
not
help
mingling
tears
with
my
remonstrances
,
and
Baynard
was
so
penetrated
with
these
marks
of
my
affection
,
that
he
lost
all
power
of
utterance
.
<EOS>
He
pressed
me
to
his
breast
with
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
and
wept
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
exclaimed
,
"
Friendship
is
undoubtedly
the
most
precious
balm
of
life
!
<EOS>
Your
words
,
dear
Bramble
,
have
in
a
great
measure
recalled
me
from
an
abyss
of
despondence
,
in
which
I
have
been
long
overwhelmed
  
<EOS>
I
will
,
upon
honour
,
make
you
acquainted
with
a
distinct
state
of
my
affairs
,
and
,
as
far
as
I
am
able
to
go
will
follow
the
course
you
prescribe
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
certain
lengths
which
my
nature
  
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
there
are
tender
connexions
,
of
which
a
batchelor
has
no
idea
  
<EOS>
Shall
I
own
my
weakness
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
making
that
woman
uneasy
 
"
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
(
cried
I
)
<EOS>
she
has
seen
you
unhappy
for
a
series
of
years
 
unhappy
from
her
misconduct
,
without
ever
shewing
the
least
inclination
to
alleviate
your
distress
 
"
"
Nevertheless
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
she
loves
me
with
the
most
warm
affection
;
but
these
are
incongruities
in
the
composition
of
the
human
mind
which
I
hold
to
be
inexplicable
.
"
    
<EOS>
I
was
shocked
at
his
infatuation
,
and
changed
the
subject
,
after
we
had
agreed
to
maintain
a
close
correspondence
for
the
future
  
<EOS>
He
then
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
he
had
two
neighbours
,
who
,
like
himself
,
were
driven
by
their
wives
at
full
speed
,
in
the
high
road
to
bankruptcy
and
ruin
.
<EOS>
All
the
three
husbands
were
of
dispositions
very
different
from
each
other
,
and
,
according
to
this
variation
,
their
consorts
were
admirably
suited
to
the
purpose
of
keeping
them
all
three
in
subjection
.
<EOS>
The
views
of
the
ladies
were
exactly
the
same
.
<EOS>
They
vied
in
grandeur
,
that
is
,
in
ostentation
,
with
the
wife
of
Sir
Charles
Chickwell
,
who
had
four
times
their
fortune
;
and
she
again
piqued
herself
upon
making
an
equal
figure
with
a
neighbouring
peeress
,
whose
revenue
trebled
her
own
.
<EOS>
Here
then
was
the
fable
of
the
frog
and
the
ox
,
realized
in
four
different
instances
within
the
same
county
:
<EOS>
one
large
fortune
,
and
three
moderate
estates
,
in
a
fair
way
of
being
burst
by
the
inflamation
of
female
vanity
;
and
in
three
of
these
instances
,
three
different
forms
of
female
tyranny
were
exercised
.
<EOS>
Mr
Baynard
was
subjugated
by
practising
upon
the
tenderness
of
his
nature
.
<EOS>
Mr
Milksan
,
being
of
a
timorous
disposition
,
truckled
to
the
insolence
of
a
termagant
.
<EOS>
Mr
Sowerby
,
who
was
of
a
temper
neither
to
be
moved
by
fits
,
nor
driven
by
menaces
,
had
the
fortune
to
be
fitted
with
a
helpmate
,
who
assailed
him
with
the
weapons
of
irony
and
satire
;
sometimes
sneering
in
the
way
of
compliment
;
sometimes
throwing
out
sarcastic
comparisons
,
implying
reproaches
upon
his
want
of
taste
,
spirit
,
and
generosity
:
by
which
means
she
stimulated
his
passions
from
one
act
of
extravagance
to
another
,
just
as
the
circumstances
of
her
vanity
required
.
    
<EOS>
All
these
three
ladies
have
at
this
time
the
same
number
of
horses
,
carriages
,
and
servants
in
and
out
of
livery
;
the
same
variety
of
dress
;
the
same
quantity
of
plate
and
china
;
the
like
ornaments
in
furniture
;
and
in
their
entertainments
they
endeavour
to
exceed
one
another
in
the
variety
,
delicacy
,
and
expence
of
their
dishes
.
<EOS>
I
believe
it
will
be
found
upon
enquiry
,
that
nineteen
out
of
twenty
,
who
are
ruined
by
extravagance
,
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
ridiculous
pride
and
vanity
of
silly
women
,
whose
parts
are
held
in
contempt
by
the
very
men
whom
they
pillage
and
enslave
.
<EOS>
Thank
heaven
,
Dick
,
that
among
all
the
follies
,
and
weaknesses
of
human
nature
,
I
have
not
yet
fallen
into
that
of
matrimony
.
    
<EOS>
After
Baynard
<EOS>
and
I
had
discussed
all
these
matters
at
leisure
,
we
returned
towards
the
house
,
and
met
Jery
with
our
two
women
,
who
had
come
forth
to
take
the
air
,
as
the
lady
of
the
mansion
had
not
yet
made
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mrs
Baynard
did
not
produce
herself
,
till
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
dinner
was
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Then
her
husband
brought
her
into
the
parlour
,
accompanied
by
her
aunt
and
son
,
and
she
received
us
with
a
coldness
of
reserve
sufficient
to
freeze
the
very
soul
of
hospitality
.
<EOS>
Though
she
knew
I
had
been
the
intimate
friend
of
her
husband
,
and
had
often
seen
me
with
him
in
London
,
she
shewed
no
marks
of
recognition
or
regard
,
when
I
addressed
myself
to
her
in
the
most
friendly
terms
of
salutation
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
even
express
the
common
complement
of
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
:
or
,
I
hope
you
have
enjoyed
your
health
since
we
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
;
or
some
such
words
of
course
:
nor
did
she
once
open
her
mouth
in
the
way
of
welcome
to
my
sister
and
my
niece
:
but
sat
in
silence
like
a
statue
,
with
an
aspect
of
insensibility
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
,
the
model
upon
which
she
had
been
formed
,
was
indeed
the
very
essence
of
insipid
formality
:
but
the
boy
was
very
pert
and
impudent
,
and
prated
without
ceasing
.
    
<EOS>
At
dinner
,
the
lady
maintained
the
same
ungracious
indifference
,
never
speaking
but
in
whispers
to
her
aunt
?
<EOS>
and
as
to
the
repast
,
it
was
made
up
of
a
parcel
of
kickshaws
,
contrived
by
a
Frence
cook
,
without
one
substantial
article
adapted
to
the
satisfaction
of
an
English
appetite
.
<EOS>
The
pottage
was
little
better
than
bread
soaked
in
dish
-
washing
,
lukewarm
.
<EOS>
The
ragouts
looked
as
if
they
had
been
once
eaten
and
half
digested
:
the
fricassees
were
involved
in
a
nasty
yellow
poultice
;
and
the
rotis
were
scorched
and
stinking
,
for
the
honour
of
the
fumet
.
<EOS>
The
desert
consisted
of
faded
fruit
and
iced
froth
,
a
good
emblem
of
our
landlady
's
character
;
the
table
-
beer
was
sour
,
the
water
foul
,
and
the
wine
vapid
;
but
there
was
a
parade
of
plate
and
china
,
and
a
powdered
lacquey
stood
behind
every
chair
,
except
those
of
the
master
and
mistress
of
the
house
,
who
were
served
by
two
valets
dressed
like
gentleman
.
<EOS>
We
dined
in
a
large
old
Gothic
parlour
,
which
was
formerly
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
paved
with
marble
,
and
,
notwithstanding
the
fire
,
which
had
been
kindled
about
an
hour
,
struck
me
with
such
a
chill
sensation
,
that
when
I
entered
it
the
teeth
chattered
in
my
jaws
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
every
thing
was
cold
,
comfortless
and
disgusting
,
except
the
looks
of
my
friend
Baynard
,
which
declared
the
warmth
of
his
affection
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
After
dinner
we
withdrew
into
another
apartment
,
where
the
boy
began
to
be
impertinently
troublesome
to
my
niece
Liddy
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
a
play
-
fellow
,
forsooth
;
and
would
have
romped
with
her
,
<EOS>
had
she
encouraged
his
advances
  
<EOS>
He
was
even
so
impudent
as
to
snatch
a
kiss
,
at
which
she
changed
countenance
,
and
seemed
uneasy
;
and
though
his
father
checked
him
for
the
rudeness
of
his
behaviour
,
he
became
so
outrageous
as
to
thrust
his
hand
in
her
bosom
:
an
insult
to
which
she
did
not
tamely
submit
,
though
one
of
the
mildest
creatures
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
sparkling
with
resentment
,
she
started
up
,
and
lent
him
such
a
box
in
the
ear
,
as
sent
him
staggering
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
"
Miss
Melford
,
(
cried
his
father
)
<EOS>
you
have
treated
him
with
the
utmost
propriety
  
<EOS>
I
am
only
sorry
that
the
impertinence
of
any
child
of
mine
should
have
occasioned
this
exertion
of
your
spirit
,
which
I
can
not
but
applaud
and
admire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
wife
was
so
far
from
assenting
to
the
candour
of
his
apology
,
that
she
rose
from
table
,
and
,
taking
her
son
by
the
hand
,
"
Come
,
child
,
(
<EOS>
said
she
)
<EOS>
your
father
can
not
abide
you
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
retired
with
this
hopeful
youth
,
and
was
followed
by
her
gouvernante
:
<EOS>
but
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
deigned
to
take
the
least
notice
of
the
company
.
    
<EOS>
Baynard
was
exceedingly
disconcerted
;
but
I
perceived
his
uneasiness
was
tinctured
with
resentment
,
and
derived
a
good
omen
from
this
discovery
.
<EOS>
I
ordered
the
horses
to
be
put
to
the
carriage
,
and
,
though
he
made
some
efforts
to
detain
us
all
night
,
I
insisted
upon
leaving
the
house
immediately
;
but
,
before
I
went
away
,
I
took
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
again
in
private
.
<EOS>
I
said
every
thing
I
could
recollect
,
to
animate
his
endeavours
in
shaking
off
those
shameful
trammels
.
<EOS>
I
made
no
scruple
to
declare
,
that
his
wife
was
unworthy
of
that
tender
complaisance
which
he
had
shewn
for
her
foibles
:
that
she
was
dead
to
all
the
genuine
sentiments
of
conjugal
affection
;
insensible
of
her
own
honour
and
interest
,
and
seemingly
destitute
of
common
sense
and
reflection
,
I
conjured
him
to
remember
what
he
owed
to
his
father
's
house
,
to
his
own
reputation
,
and
to
his
family
,
including
even
this
unreasonable
woman
herself
,
who
was
driving
on
blindly
to
her
own
destruction
.
<EOS>
I
advised
him
to
form
a
plan
for
retrenching
superfluous
expence
,
and
try
to
convince
the
aunt
of
the
necessity
for
such
a
reformation
,
that
she
might
gradually
prepare
her
niece
for
its
execution
;
and
I
exhorted
him
to
turn
that
disagreeable
piece
of
formality
out
of
the
house
,
if
he
should
find
her
averse
to
his
proposal
.
    
<EOS>
Here
he
interrupted
me
with
a
sigh
,
observing
that
such
a
step
would
undoubtedly
be
fatal
to
Mrs
Baynard
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
lose
all
patience
(
cried
I
)
to
hear
you
talk
so
weakly
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Baynard
's
fits
will
never
hurt
her
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
believe
in
my
conscience
they
are
all
affected
:
I
am
sure
she
has
no
feeling
for
your
distresses
;
and
,
when
you
are
ruined
,
she
will
appear
to
have
no
feeling
for
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Finally
,
I
took
his
word
and
honour
,
that
he
would
make
an
effort
,
such
as
I
had
advised
;
that
he
would
form
a
plan
of
oeconomy
,
and
,
if
he
found
it
impracticable
without
my
assistance
,
he
would
come
to
Bath
in
the
winter
,
where
I
promised
to
give
him
the
meeting
,
and
contribute
all
in
my
power
to
the
retrieval
of
his
affairs
  
With
this
mutual
engagement
we
parted
;
and
I
shall
think
myself
supremely
happy
,
if
,
by
my
means
,
a
worthy
man
,
whom
I
love
and
esteem
,
can
be
saved
from
misery
,
disgrace
and
despair
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
only
one
friend
more
to
visit
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
but
he
is
of
a
complexion
very
different
from
that
of
Baynard
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
memention
Sir
Thomas
Bullford
,
whom
I
knew
in
Italy
.
<EOS>
He
is
now
become
a
country
gentleman
;
but
,
being
disabled
by
the
gout
from
enjoying
any
amusement
abroad
,
he
entertains
himself
within
doors
,
by
keeping
open
house
for
all
comers
,
and
playing
upon
the
oddities
and
humours
of
his
company
:
but
he
himself
is
generally
the
greatest
original
at
his
table
.
<EOS>
He
is
very
good
-
humoured
,
talks
much
,
and
laughs
without
ceasing
.
<EOS>
I
am
told
that
all
the
use
he
makes
of
his
understanding
at
present
,
is
to
excite
mirth
,
by
exhibiting
his
guests
in
ludicrous
attitudes
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
far
we
may
furnish
him
with
entertainment
of
this
kind
,
but
I
am
resolved
to
beat
up
his
quarters
,
partly
with
a
view
to
laugh
with
the
knight
himself
,
and
partly
to
pay
my
respects
to
his
lady
,
a
good
-
natured
sensible
woman
,
with
whom
he
lives
upon
very
easy
terms
,
although
she
has
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
bring
him
an
heir
to
his
estate
.
    
<EOS>
And
now
,
dear
Dick
,
I
must
tell
you
for
your
comfort
,
that
you
are
the
only
man
upon
earth
to
whom
I
would
presume
to
send
such
a
long
-
winded
epistle
,
which
I
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
curtail
,
because
the
subject
interested
the
warmest
passions
of
my
heart
;
neither
will
I
make
any
other
apology
to
a
corespondent
who
has
been
so
long
accustomed
to
the
impertinence
of
    
Matt

Sept.

<EOS>
To
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bar
t.
at
Oxon
,
    
DEAR
KNIGHT
,
I
BELIEVE
,
there
is
something
mischievous
in
my
disposition
,
for
nothing
diverts
me
so
much
as
to
see
certain
characters
tormented
with
false
terrors
.
  
<EOS>
We
last
night
lodged
at
the
house
of
sir
Thomas
Bullford
,
an
old
friend
of
my
uncle
,
a
jolly
fellow
,
of
moderate
intellects
,
who
,
in
spite
of
the
gout
,
which
had
lamed
him
,
is
resolved
to
be
merry
to
the
last
;
and
mirth
he
has
a
particular
nack
in
extracting
from
his
guests
,
let
their
humour
be
never
so
caustic
or
refractory
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
our
company
,
there
was
in
the
house
a
fat
-
headed
justice
of
the
peace
,
called
Frogmore
,
and
a
country
practioner
in
surgery
,
who
seemed
to
be
our
landlord
's
chief
companion
and
confidant
.
  
<EOS>
We
found
the
knight
sitting
on
a
couch
,
with
his
cruches
by
his
side
,
and
his
feet
supported
on
cushions
;
but
he
received
us
with
a
hearty
welcome
,
and
seemed
greatly
rejoiced
at
our
arrival
.
  
<EOS>
After
tea
we
were
entertained
with
a
sonata
on
the
harpsichord
by
lady
Bullford
,
who
sung
and
played
to
admiration
;
but
sir
Thomas
seemed
to
be
a
little
asinine
in
the
article
of
ears
,
though
he
affected
to
be
in
raptures
;
and
begged
his
wife
to
favour
us
with
an
arietta
of
her
own
composing
.
  
<EOS>
This
arietta
,
however
,
she
no
sooner
began
to
perform
,
than
he
and
the
justice
fell
asleep
;
but
the
moment
she
ceased
playing
,
the
knight
waked
snorting
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
O
cara
!
<EOS>
what
d'ye
think
,
gentlemen
?
<EOS>
Will
you
talk
any
more
of
your
Pargolesi
and
your
Corelli
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
thrust
his
tongue
in
one
cheek
,
and
leered
with
one
eye
at
the
doctor
and
me
,
who
sat
on
his
left
hand
.
  
<EOS>
He
concluded
the
pantomime
with
a
loud
laugh
,
which
he
could
command
at
all
times
extempore
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
disorder
,
he
did
not
do
penance
at
supper
,
nor
did
he
ever
refuse
his
glass
when
the
toast
went
round
,
but
rather
encouraged
a
quick
circulation
,
both
by
precept
and
example
.
    
<EOS>
I
soon
perceived
the
doctor
had
made
himself
very
necessary
to
the
baronet
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
the
whetstone
of
his
wit
,
the
but
of
his
satire
,
and
his
operator
in
certain
experiments
of
humour
,
which
were
occasionally
tried
upon
strangers
  
<EOS>
Justice
Frogmore
was
an
excellent
subject
for
this
species
of
philosophy
;
sleek
and
corpulent
,
solemn
and
shallow
,
he
had
studied
Burn
with
uncommon
application
,
but
he
studied
nothing
so
much
as
the
art
of
living
(
that
is
,
eating
)
well
.
  
<EOS>
This
fat
buck
had
often
offorded
good
sport
to
our
landlord
;
and
he
was
frequently
started
with
tolerable
success
,
in
the
course
of
this
evening
;
but
the
baronet
's
appetite
for
redicule
seemed
to
be
chiefly
exited
by
the
appearance
,
address
,
and
conversation
of
Lismahago
,
whom
he
attempted
in
all
the
different
modes
of
exposition
;
but
he
put
me
in
mind
of
a
contest
that
I
once
saw
betwixt
a
young
hound
and
and
old
hedge
-
hog
  
<EOS>
The
dog
turned
him
over
and
over
,
and
bounced
,
and
barked
,
and
mumbled
;
but
as
often
as
he
attempted
to
bite
,
he
felt
a
prickle
in
his
jaws
,
and
recoiled
in
manifest
confusion
:
  
<EOS>
The
captain
,
when
left
to
himself
,
will
not
fail
to
turn
his
ludicrous
side
to
the
company
,
but
if
any
man
attempts
to
force
him
into
that
attitude
,
he
becomes
stubborn
as
a
mule
,
and
unmanageable
as
an
elephant
unbroke
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
tolerable
jokes
were
cracked
upon
the
justice
who
eat
a
most
unconscionable
supper
,
and
,
among
other
things
,
a
large
plate
of
broiled
mushrooms
,
which
he
had
no
sooner
swallowed
than
the
doctor
observed
,
with
great
gravity
,
that
they
were
of
the
kind
called
champignons
,
which
in
some
constitutions
had
a
poisonous
effect
  
Mr
Frogmore
,
startled
at
this
remark
,
asked
,
in
some
confusion
,
why
he
had
not
been
so
kind
as
to
give
him
that
notice
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
He
answered
,
that
he
took
it
for
granted
,
by
his
eating
them
so
heartily
,
that
he
was
used
to
the
dish
;
but
as
he
seemed
to
be
under
some
apprehension
,
he
prescribed
a
bumper
of
plague
water
,
which
the
justice
drank
off
immediately
,
and
retired
to
rest
,
not
without
marks
of
terror
and
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
At
midnight
we
were
shewn
to
our
different
chambers
,
and
in
half
an
hour
,
I
was
fast
asleep
in
bed
;
but
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
<EOS>
I
was
waked
with
a
dismal
cry
of
Fire
!
<EOS>
and
starting
up
,
ran
to
the
window
in
my
shirt
.
  
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
and
stormy
;
and
a
number
of
people
half
-
dressed
ran
backwards
and
forwards
thro
'
the
court
-
yard
,
with
links
and
lanterns
,
seemingly
in
the
utmost
hurry
and
trepidation
.
  
<EOS>
Slipping
on
my
cloaths
in
a
twinkling
,
I
ran
down
stairs
,
and
,
upon
inquiry
,
found
the
fire
was
confined
to
a
backstair
,
which
led
to
a
detached
apartment
where
Lismahago
lay
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
lieutenant
was
alarmed
by
a
bawling
at
his
window
,
which
was
in
the
second
story
,
but
he
could
not
find
his
cloaths
in
the
dark
,
and
his
room
-
door
was
locked
on
the
outside
  
The
servants
called
to
him
,
that
the
house
had
been
robbed
;
that
,
without
all
doubt
,
the
villians
had
taken
away
his
cloaths
,
fastened
the
door
,
and
set
the
house
on
fire
,
for
the
staircase
was
in
flames
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
the
poor
lieutenant
ran
about
the
room
naked
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
,
poping
out
his
head
at
the
window
between
whiles
,
and
imploring
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
the
knight
in
person
was
brought
out
in
his
chair
,
attended
by
my
uncle
and
all
the
family
,
including
our
aunt
Tabitha
,
who
screamed
,
and
cried
,
and
tore
her
hair
,
as
if
she
had
been
distracted
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
had
already
ordered
his
people
to
bring
a
long
ladder
,
which
was
applied
to
the
captain
's
window
and
now
he
exhorted
him
earnestly
to
descend
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
of
much
rhetoric
to
persuade
Lismahago
,
who
forthwith
made
his
exit
by
the
window
,
roaring
all
the
time
to
the
people
below
to
hold
fast
the
ladder
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
gravity
of
the
occasion
,
it
was
impossible
to
behold
this
scene
without
being
seized
with
an
inclination
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
The
rueful
aspect
of
the
lieutenant
in
his
shirt
with
a
quilted
night
-
cap
fastened
under
his
chin
,
and
his
long
lank
limbs
and
posteriors
,
exposed
to
the
wind
,
made
a
very
picturesque
appearance
,
when
illumined
by
the
links
and
torches
which
the
servants
held
up
to
light
him
in
his
descent
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
company
stood
round
the
ladder
,
except
the
knight
,
who
sat
in
his
chair
,
exclaiming
from
time
to
time
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
save
the
gentleman
's
life

<EOS>
O

<EOS>

your

,
dear
captain
  
<EOS>
I
'm
rejoiced
to
see
thee
safe
and
found
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lismahago
was
received
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
by
his
inamorata
,
who
snatching
a
blanket
from
one
of
the
maids
,
wrapped
it
about
his
body
;
two
men
-
servants
took
him
under
the
arms
,
and
a
female
conducted
him
to
the
green
room
,
still
accompanied
by
Mrs
Tabitha
,
who
saw
him
fairly
put
to
bed
.
  
<EOS>
During
this
whole
transaction
,
he
spoke
not
a
syllable
,
but
looked
exceeding
grim
,
sometimes
at
one
,
sometimes
at
another
of
the
spectators
,
who
now
adjourned
in
a
body
to
the
parlour
where
we
had
supped
,
every
one
surveying
another
with
marks
of
astonishment
and
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
The
knight
being
seated
in
an
easy
chair
,
seized
my
uncle
by
the
hand
,
and
bursting
into
a
long
and
loud
laugh
,
"

"
After
all
then
,
(
cried
Mr
Bramble
very
gravely
)
<EOS>
this
was
no
more
than
a
false
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
been
frightened
out
of
our
beds
,
and
almost
out
of
our
senses
,
for
the
joke

sake

<EOS>
"
Aye

cried
our
landlord
)

Have

replied
our

squire

;
we
are
not
yet
come
to
the
catastrophe
;
and
pray
God
it
may
not
turn
out
a
tragedy
instead
of
a
farce
.
  
<EOS>
The
captain
is
one
of
those
saturnine
subjects
,
who
have
no
idea
of
humour
.
  
<EOS>
He
never
laughs
in
his
own
person
;
nor
can
he
bear
that
other
people
should
laugh
at
his
expence
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
the
subject
had
been
properly
chosen
,
the
joke
was
too
severe
in
all
conscience
.
"
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
knight
)
<EOS>
I
could
not
have
bated
him
an
ace
<EOS>
had
he
been
my
own
father
;
and
as
for
the
subject
,
such
another
does
not
present
itself
once
in
half
a
century
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Tabitha
interposing
,
and
bridling
up
,
declared
,
she
did
not
see
that
Mr
Lismahago
was
a
fitter
subject
for
ridicule
than
the
knight
himself
;
and
that
she
was
very
much
afraid
,
he
would
very
soon
find
he
had
mistaken
his
man
  
<EOS>
The
baronet
was
a
good
deal
disconcerted
by
this
intimation
,
saying
,
that
he
must
be
a
Goth
and
a
barbarian
,
if
he
did
not
enter
into
the
spirit
of
such
a
happy
and
humorous
contrivance
.
  
<EOS>
He
begged
,
however
that
Mr
Bramble
and
his
sister
would
bring
him
to
reason
;
and
this
request
was
reinforced
by
lady
Bullford
,
who
did
not
fail
to
read
the
baronet
a
lecture
upon
this
indiscretion
,
which
lecture
he
received
with
submission
on
one
side
of
his
face
,
and
a
leer
upon
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
We
now
went
to
bed
for
the
second
time
;
and
before
I
got
up
,
my
uncle
had
visited
Lismahago
in
the
green
room
,
and
used
such
arguments
with
him
,
that
when
we
met
in
the
parlour
he
seemed
to
be
quite
appeased
.
  
<EOS>
He
received
the
knight
's
apology
with
a
good
grace
,
and
even
professed
himself
pleased
at
finding
he
had
contributed
to
the
diversion
of
the
company
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
laughing
heartily
;
and
then
desired
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
in
token
of
perfect
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
putting
his
hand
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
pulled
out
,
instead
of
his
own
Scotch
mull
,
a
very
fine
gold
snuff
box
,
which
he
no
sooner
perceived
than
he
said
,
"
Here
is
a
small
mistake
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
mistake
at
all
(
cried
the
baronet
)
:
a
fair
exchange
is
no
robbery
.
  
<EOS>
Oblige
me
so
far
,
captain
,
as
to
let
me
keep
your
mull
as
a
memorial
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
said
the
lieutenant
)
<EOS>
the
mull
is
much
at
your
service
;
but
this
machine
I
can
by
no
means
retain
.
  
<EOS>
It
looks
like
compounding
a
sort
of
felony
in
the
code
of
honour
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
but
there
may
be
another
joke
in
this
conveyance
;
and
I
do
n't
find
myself
disposed
to
be
brought
upon
the
stage
again
.
  
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
presume
to
make
free
with
your
pockets
,
but
I
beg
you
will
put
it
up
again
with
your
own
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
with
a
certain
austerity
of
aspect
,
he
presented
the
snuff
-
box
to
the
knight
,
who
received
it
in
some
confusion
,
and
restored
the
mull
,
which
he
would
by
no
means
keep
,
except
on
the
terms
of
exchange
.
    
<EOS>
This
transaction
was
like
to
give
a
grave
cast
to
the
conversation
,
when
my
uncle
took
notice
that
Mr
Justice
Frogmore
had
not
made
his
appearance
either
at
the
night
-
alarm
,
or
now
at
the
general
rendezvous
.
  
<EOS>
The
baronet
hearing
Frogmore
mentioned
,
"
Odso
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
I
had
forgot
the
justice
.
  
<EOS>
Pr'ythee
,
doctor
,
go
and
bring
him
out
of
his
kennel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
laughing
till
his
sides
were
well
shaken
,
he
said
he
would
shew
the
captain
,
that
he
was
not
the
only
person
of
the
drama
exhibited
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
night
-
scene
,
it
could
not
affect
the
justice
,
who
had
been
purposely
lodged
in
the
farther
end
of
the
house
,
remote
from
the
noise
,
and
lulled
with
a
dose
of
opium
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
Mr
Justice
was
led
into
the
parlour
in
his
night
-
cap
and
loose
morning
gown
,
rolling
his
head
from
side
to
side
,
and
groaning
piteously
all
the
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jesu
!
<EOS>
neighbour
<EOS>
Frogmore
,
(
exclaimed
the
baronet
)
<EOS>
what
is
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
you
look
as
if
you
was
not
a
man
for
this
world
.
  
<EOS>
Set
him
down
softly
on
the
couch
 
poor
gentleman
!
  
<EOS>
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
  
<EOS>
What
makes
him
so
pale
,
and
yellow
,
and
bloated
?
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
Thomas
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
justice
)
<EOS>
I
doubt
'
tis
all
over
with
me
  
<EOS>
Those
mushrooms
I
eat
at
your
table
have
done
my
business
 
ah
!
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
hey
!
"
<EOS>
"
Now
the
Lord
forbid
!
<EOS>
(
said
the
other
)
 
<EOS>
what
!
<EOS>
man
,
have
a
good
heart
.
  
<EOS>
How
does
thy
stomach
feel
?
 
<EOS>
hah
?
"
    
<EOS>
To
this
interrogation
he
made
no
reply
,
but
throwing
aside
his
night
gown
,
<EOS>
discovered
that
his
waistcoat
would
not
meet
upon
his
belly
by
five
good
inches
at
least
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
protect
us
all
!
<EOS>
(
cried
sir
Thomas
)
 
what
a
melancholy
spectacle
!
  
<EOS>
never
did
I
see
a
man
so
suddenly
swelled
,
but
when
he
was
either
just
dead
,
or
just
dying
.
  
<EOS>
Doctor
,
can'st
thou
do
nothing
for
this
poor
object
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
the
case
is
quite
desperate
(
said
the
surgeon
)
,
but
I
would
advise
Mr
Frogmore
to
settle
his
affairs
with
all
expedition
;
the
parson
may
come
and
pray
by
him
,
while
I
prepare
a
clyster
and
an
emetic
draught
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
justice
,
rolling
his
languid
eyes
,
ejaculated
with
great
fervency
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
Christ
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
he
begged
the
surgeon
,
in
the
name
of
God
,
to
dispatch
  
"
<EOS>
As
for
my
wordly
affairs
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
they
are
all
settled
but
one
mortgage
,
which
must
be
left
to
my
heirs
 
but
my
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
my
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
my
poor
soul
?
 
<EOS>
miserable
sinner
that
I
am
!
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
pr'ythee
my
dear
boy
,
compose
thyself
(
resumed
the
knight
)
;
consider
the
mercy
of
heaven
is
infinite
;
thou
can'st
not
have
any
sins
of
a
very
deep
dye
on
thy
conscience
,
or
the
devil
's
in't
.
"
<EOS>
"
Name
not
the
devil
(
exclaimed
the
terrified
Frogmore
)
,
I
have
more
sins
to
answer
for
than
the
world
dreams
of
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
friend
,
I
have
been
sly
 
sly
 
damn'd
sly
!
  
<EOS>
Send
for
the
parson
without
loss
of
time
,
and
put
me
to
bed
for
I
am
posting
to
eternity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
accordingly
raised
from
the
couch
,
and
supported
by
two
servants
,
who
led
him
back
to
his
room
;
but
before
he
quitted
the
parlour
,
he
entreated
the
good
company
to
assist
him
with
their
prayers
.
  
<EOS>
He
added
,
"
Take
warning
by
me
who
am
suddenly
cut
off
in
my
prime
,
like
a
flower
of
the
field
;
and
God
forgive
you
,
sir
Thomas
,
for
suffering
such
poisonous
tresh
to
be
eaten
at
your
table
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
removed
out
of
hearing
,
than
the
baronet
abandoned
himself
to
a
violent
fit
of
laughing
,
in
which
he
was
joined
by
the
greatest
part
of
the
company
;
but
we
could
hardly
prevent
the
good
lady
from
going
to
undeceive
the
patient
,
by
discovering
,
that
while
he
slept
his
waistcoat
had
been
straitened
by
the
contrivance
of
the
surgeon
;
and
that
the
disorder
in
his
stomach
and
bowels
was
occasioned
by
some
animonial
wine
,
which
he
had
taken
over
night
,
under
the
denomination
of
plague
-
water
.
  
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
think
that
his
apprehension
might
put
an
end
to
his
life
;
the
knight
swore
he
was
no
such
chicken
,
but
a
tough
old
rogue
,
that
would
live
long
enough
to
plague
all
his
neighbours
.
<EOS>
Upon
enquiry
,
we
found
his
character
did
not
entitle
him
to
much
compassion
or
respect
,
and
therefore
we
let
our
landlord
's
humour
take
its
course
.
  
<EOS>
A
clyster
was
actually
administered
by
an
old
woman
of
the
family
who
had
been
sir
Thomas
's
nurse
,
and
the
patient
took
a
draught
made
with
oxymel
of
squills
to
forward
the
operation
of
the
antimonial
wine
,
which
had
been
retarded
by
the
opiate
of
the
preceding
night
.
<EOS>
He
was
visited
by
the
vicar
,
who
read
prayers
,
and
began
to
take
an
account
of
the
state
of
his
soul
,
when
those
medicines
produced
their
effect
;
so
that
the
parson
was
obliged
to
hold
his
nose
while
he
poured
forth
spiritual
consolation
from
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
The
same
expedient
was
used
by
the
knight
and
me
,
who
,
with
the
doctor
,
entered
the
chamber
at
this
juncture
,
and
found
Frogmore
enthroned
on
an
easy
-
chair
,
under
the
pressure
of
a
double
evacuation
.
<EOS>
The
short
intervals
betwixt
<EOS>
every
heave
he
employed
in
crying
for
mercy
,
confessing
his
sins
,
or
asking
the
vicar
's
opinion
of
his
case
;
and
the
vicar
answered
,
in
a
solemn
snuffling
tone
,
that
heightened
the
ridicule
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
The
emetic
having
done
its
office
,
the
doctor
interfered
,
and
ordered
the
patient
to
be
put
in
bed
again
.
<EOS>
When
he
examined
the
egista
,
and
felt
his
pulse
,
he
declared
that
much
of
the
virus
was
discharged
,
and
,
giving
him
a
composing
draught
,
assured
him
he
had
good
hopes
of
his
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
This
welcome
hint
he
received
with
the
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes
,
protesting
<EOS>
,
that
if
he
should
recover
,
he
would
always
think
himself
indebted
for
his
life
to
the
great
skill
and
tenderness
of
his
doctor
,
whose
hand
he
squeezed
with
great
fervor
;
and
thus
he
was
left
to
his
repose
.
    
<EOS>
We
were
pressed
to
stay
dinner
,
that
we
might
be
witness
of
his
resuscitation
but
my
uncle
insisted
upon
our
departing
before
noon
,
that
we
might
reach
this
town
before
it
should
be
dark
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
lady
Bullford
conducted
us
into
the
garden
to
see
a
fish
-
pond
just
finished
,
which
Mr
Bramble
censured
as
being
too
near
the
parlour
,
where
the
knight
now
fat
by
himself
,
dozing
in
an
-
elbow
chair
after
the
fatigues
of
his
morning
atchievement
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
situation
he
reclined
,
with
his
feet
wrapped
in
flannel
,
and
supported
in
a
line
with
his
body
,
when
the
door
flying
open
with
a
violent
shock
lieutenant
Lismahago
rushed
into
the
room
with
horror
in
his
looks
,
exclaiming
,
"
A
mad
dog
!
<EOS>
a
mad
dog
!
"
and
throwing
up
the
window
sash
,
leaped
into
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
,
waked
by
this
tremendous
exclamation
,
started
up
and
forgetting
his
gout
,
followed
the
lieutenant
's
example
by
a
kind
of
instinctive
impulse
.
  
<EOS>
He
not
only
bolted
thro
'
the
window
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
,
but
ran
up
to
his
middle
in
the
pond
before
he
gave
the
least
sign
of
recollection
.
<EOS>
Then
the
captain
began
to
bawl
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
pray
take
care
of
the
gentleman
!
 
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
mind
<EOS>
your
footing
,
my
dear
boy
!
 
<EOS>
get
warm
blankets
 
<EOS>
comfort
his
poor
carcase
 
<EOS>
warm
the
bed
in
the
green
room
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Lady
Bullford
was
thunder
-
struck
at
this
phenomenon
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
gazed
in
silent
astonishment
,
while
the
servants
hastened
to
assist
their
master
,
who
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
back
into
the
parlour
without
speaking
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
Being
instantly
accommodated
with
dry
clothes
and
flannels
,
comforted
with
a
cordial
,
and
replaced
in
statu
quo
,
one
of
the
maids
was
ordered
to
chafe
,
his
lower
extremities
,
an
operation
in
consequence
of
which
his
senses
seemed
to
return
and
his
good
humour
to
revive
.
  
<EOS>
As
we
had
followed
him
into
the
room
,
he
looked
at
every
individual
in
his
turn
,
with
a
certain
ludicrous
expression
in
his
countenance
,
but
fixed
his
eye
in
particular
upon
Lismahago
,
who
presented
him
with
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
and
when
he
took
it
in
silence
,
"
Sir
Thomas
Bullford
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
all
your
favours
,
and
some
of
them
I
have
endeavoured
to
repay
in
your
own
coin
.
"
<EOS>
"
Give
me
thy
hand
(
cried
the
baronet
)
;
thou
hast
indeed
payed
me
Scot
and
lot
;
and
even
left
a
ballance
in
my
hands
,
for
which
,
in
presence
of
this
company
,
I
promise
to
be
accountable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
laughed
very
heartily
,
and
even
seemed
to
enjoy
the
retaliation
which
had
been
exacted
at
his
own
expence
;
but
lady
Bullford
looked
very
grave
;
and
in
all
probability
thought
the
lieutenant
had
carried
his
resentment
too
far
,
considering
that
her
husband
was
valetudinary
 
but
,
according
to
the
proverb
,
<EOS>
he
that
will
play
at
bowls
must
expect
to
meet
with
rubbers
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
seen
a
tame
bear
,
very
diverting
when
properly
managed
,
become
a
very
dangerous
wild
beast
when
teized
for
the
entertainment
of
the
spectators
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Lismahago
,
he
seemed
to
think
the
fright
and
the
cold
bath
would
have
a
good
effect
upon
his
patient
's
constitution
;
but
the
doctor
hinted
some
apprehension
that
the
gouty
matter
might
,
by
such
a
sudden
shock
,
be
repelled
from
the
extremities
and
thrown
upon
some
of
the
more
vital
parts
of
the
machine
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
be
very
sorry
to
see
this
prognostic
verified
upon
our
facetious
landlord
,
who
told
Mrs
Tabitha
at
parting
,
that
he
hoped
she
would
remember
him
in
the
distribution
of
the
bride
's
favours
,
as
he
had
taken
so
much
pains
to
put
the
captain
's
parts
and
mettle
to
the
proof
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
am
afraid
our
"
squire
will
appear
to
be
the
greatest
sufferer
by
the
baronet
's
wit
;
for
his
constitution
is
by
no
means
calculated
for
night
-
alarms
.
  
<EOS>
He
has
yawned
and
shivered
all
day
,
and
gone
to
bed
without
supper
;
so
that
,
as
we
have
got
into
good
quarters
,
I
imagine
we
shall
make
a
halt
to
-
morrow
;
in
which
case
,
you
will
have
at
least
one
day
's
respite
from
the
persecution
of

Melford

<EOS>
dear

Jones

MISS
Liddy
is
so
good
as
to
unclose
me
in
a
kiver
as
fur
as
Gloster
,
and
the
carrier
will
bring
it
to
hand
  
<EOS>
God
send
us
all
safe
to
Monmouthshire
,
for
I
'm
quite
jaded
with
rambling
  
'
<EOS>
Tis
<EOS>
a
true
saying
,
live
and
learn
  
<EOS>
O
woman
,
what
chuckling
and
changing
have
I
seen
!
  
<EOS>
Well
,
there
's
nothing
sartain
in
this
world
  
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
that
mistriss
,
after
all
the
pains
taken
for
the
good
of
her
prusias
sole
,
would
go
for
to
throw
away
her
poor
body
?
<EOS>
that
she
would
cast
the
heys
of
infection
upon
such
a
carrying
-
crow
as
Lashmyhago
!
<EOS>
as
old
as
Matthewfullin
,
as
dry
as
a
red
herring
,
and
as
pore
as
a
starved
veezel
  
<EOS>
O
,
Molly
;
hadst
thou
seen
him
come
down
the
ladder
,
in
a
shurt
<EOS>
so
scanty
,
tht
it
would
not
kiver
his
nakedness
!
  
<EOS>
The
young
"
squire
called
him
Dunquickset
;
but
he
looked
for
all
the
world
like
Cradoc
-
ap
-
Morgan
,
the
ould
tinker
,
that
suffered
at
Abergany
for
steeling
of
kettle
  
<EOS>
Then
he
's
a
profane
scuffle
,
and
,
as
Mr
Clinker
says
,
no
better
than
an
impfiddle
,
continually
playing
upon
the
pyebill
and
the
new
-
burth
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
has
as
little
manners
as
money
;
for
he
cant't
say
a
civil
word
,
much
more
make
me
a
present
of
a
pair
of
gloves
for
good
-
will
;
but
he
looks
as
if
he
wanted
to
be
very
forewood
and
familiar
  
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
that
ever
a
gentlewoman
of
years
and
discretion
should
tare
her
air
,
and
cry
and
disporridge
herself
for
such
a
nubjack
!
<EOS>
as
the
song
goes
      
<EOS>
"
I
vow
she
would
fain
have
a
burd
<EOS>
That
bids
such
a
price
for
an
owl
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
but
for
,
sartain
,
he
must
have
dealt
with
some
Scotch
musician
to
bring
her
to
this
pass
  
<EOS>
As
for
me
,
I
put
my
trust
in
the
Lord
;
and
I
have
got
a
slice
of
witch
elm
sowed
in
the
gathers
of
my
under
petticoat
;
and
Mr
Clinker
assures
me
,
that
by
the
new
light
of
grease
,
I
may
deify
the
devil
and
all
his
work
  
<EOS>
But
I
nose
what
I
nose
  
<EOS>
If
mistriss
should
take
up
with
Lashmyhago
,
this
is
no
sarvice
for
me
  
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
there
's
no
want
of
places
;
and
if
it
wan't
for
wan
thing
,
I
would
  
but
,
no
matter
  
Madam
Baynar
's
woman
has
twenty
good
pounds
a
-
year
and
parquisites
;
and
dresses
like
a
parson
of
distinkson
  
<EOS>
I
dined
with
her
and
the
valley
de
shambles
,
with
bags
and
golden
jackets
;
but
there
was
nothing
kimfittable
to
eat
,
being
as
how
they
live
upon
board
,
and
having
nothing
but
a
piss
of
could
cuddling
tart
and
some
blamangey
,
I
was
tuck
with
the
cullick
,
and
a
murcy
it
was
that
mistriss
had
her
viol
of
assings
in
the
cox
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
I
think
for
sartain
this
match
will
go
forewood
;
for
things
are
come
to
a
creesus
;
and
have
seen
with
my
own
hays
,
such
smuggling
  
<EOS>
But
I
scorn
for
to
exclose
the
secrets
of
the
family
;
and
if
it
wance
comes
to
marrying
,
who
nose
but
<EOS>
the
frolick
may
go
round
  
<EOS>
I
believes
as
how
,
Miss
Liddy
would
have
no
reversion
if
her
swan
would
appear
;
and
you
would
be
surprised
,
Molly
,
to
receive
a
bride
's
fever
from
your
humble
servant
 
<EOS>
but
this
is
all
suppository
,
dearl

and
I
have
sullenly
promised
to
Mr
Clinker
,
that
neither
man

woman

shall
no
<EOS>
that
arrow
said
a

<EOS>
I
hopes
to

burn
a

see

To

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
LETTY
,
THIS
method
of
writing
to
you
from
time
to
time
,
without
any
hopes
of
an
answer
,
affords
me
,
I
own
,
<EOS>
some
ease
and
satisfaction
in
the
midst
of
my
dispuiet
,
as
it
in
some
degree
lightens
the
burden
of
affliction
;
but
it
is
at
best
a
very
imperfect
enjoyment
of
friendship
,
because
it
admits
of
no
return
of
confidence
and
good
counsel
  
<EOS>
I
would
give
the
whole
world
to
have
your
company
for
a
single
day
  
<EOS>
I
am
heartily
tired
of
this
itinerant
way
of
life
  
<EOS>
I
am
quite
dizzy
with
a
perpetual
succession
of
objects
  
<EOS>
Besides
it
is
impossible
to
travel
such
a
length
of
way
,
without
being
exposed
to
inconveniences
,
dangers
,
and
disagreeable
accidents
,
which
prove
very
grievous
to
a
poor
creature
of
weak
nerves
like
me
,
and
make
me
pay
very
dear
for
the
gratification
of
my
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
never
intended
me
for
the
busy
world
  
<EOS>
I
long
for
repose
and
solitude
,
where
I
can
enjoy
that
disinterested
friendship
which
is
not
to
be
found
among
crowds
,
and
indulge
those
pleasing
reveries
that
shun
the
hurry
and
tumult
of
fashionable
society
  
<EOS>
Unexperienced
as
I
am
in
the
commerce
of
life
,
I
have
seen
enough
to
give
me
a
disgust
to
the
generality
of
those
who
carry
it
on
  
<EOS>
There
is
such
malice
,
treachery
,
and
dissimulation
,
even
among
professed
friends
and
intimate
companions
,
as
can
not
fail
to
strike
a
virtuous
mind
with
horror
;
and
when
Vice
quits
the
stage
for
a
moment
,
her
place
is
immediately
occupied
by
Folly
;
which
is
often
too
serious
to
excite
any
thing
but
compassion
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
ought
to
be
silent
on
the
foibles
of
my
poor
aunt
;
but
with
you
,
my
dear
Willis
,
I
have
no
secrets
;
and
,
truly
,
her
weaknesses
are
such
as
can
not
be
concealed
.
<EOS>
Since
the
first
moment
we
arrived
at
Bath
,
she
has
been
employed
constantly
in
spreading
nets
for
the
other
sex
;
and
at
length
,
she
has
caught
a
superannuated
lieutenant
,
who
is
in
a
fair
way
to
make
her
change
her
name
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
and
my
brother
seem
to
have
no
objection
to
this
extraordinary
match
,
which
,
I
make
no
doubt
,
will
afford
abundance
of
matter
of
conversation
and
mirth
;
for
my
part
,
I
am
too
sensible
of
my
own
weaknesses
,
to
be
diverted
with
those
of
other
people
  
<EOS>
At
present
,
I
have
something
at
heart
that
employs
my
whole
attention
,
and
keeps
my
mind
in
the
utmost
terror
and
suspense
.
    
<EOS>
Yesterday
in
the
forenoon
,
as
I
stood
with
my
brother
at
the
parlour
window
of
an
inn
,
where
we
had
lodged
,
a
person
passed
a
-
horseback
,
whom
(
gracious
Heaven
!
)
<EOS>
I
instantly
discovered
to
be
Wilson
!
<EOS>
He
wore
a
white
riding
-
coat
,
with
the
cape
buttoned
up
to
his
chin
;
looked
remarkably
pale
,
and
passed
at
a
round
trot
,
without
seeming
to
observe
us
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
could
not
see
us
;
for
there
was
a
blind
that
concealed
us
from
the
view
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
how
I
was
affected
at
this
apparition
  
<EOS>
The
light
forsook
my
eyes
;
and
I
was
seized
with
such
a
palpitation
and
trembling
,
that
I
could
not
stand
.
<EOS>
I
sat
down
upon
a
couch
,
and
strove
to
compose
myself
,
that
my
brother
might
not
perceive
my
agitation
;
but
it
was
impossible
to
escape
his
prying
eyes
  
<EOS>
He
had
observed
the
object
that
alarmed
me
;
and
,
doubtless
,
knew
him
at
the
first
glance
  
He
now
looked
at
me
with
a
stern
countenance
;
then
he
ran
out
into
the
street
,
to
see
what
road
the
unfortunate
horseman
had
taken
  
He
afterwards
dispatched
his
man
for
further
intelligence
,
and
seemed
to
meditate
some
violent
design
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
being
out
of
order
,
we
remained
another
night
at
the
inn
;
and
all
day
long
Jery
acted
the
part
of
an
indefatigable
spy
upon
my
conduct
  
<EOS>
He
watched
my
very
looks
with
such
eagerness
of
attention
,
as
if
he
would
have
penetrated
into
the
utmost
recesses
of
my
heart
  
<EOS>
This
may
be
owing
to
his
regard
for
my
honour
,
if
it
is
not
the
effect
of
his
own
pride
;
but
he
is
so
hot
,
and
violent
,
and
unrelenting
,
that
the
sight
of
him
alone
throws
me
into
a
flutter
;
and
really
it
will
not
be
in
my
power
to
afford
him
any
share
of
my
affection
,
if
he
persists
in
persecuting
me
at
this
rate
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
has
formed
some
scheme
of
vengeance
,
which
will
make
me
completely
wretched
!
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
suspects
some
collusion
from
this
appearance
of
Wilson
  
Good
God
!
<EOS>
did
he
really
appear
?
<EOS>
or
was
it
only
a
phantom
,
a
pale
spectre
to
apprise
me
of
his
death
?
    
<EOS>
O
Letty
,
what
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
where
shall
I
turn
for
advice
and
consolation
?
 
<EOS>
shall
I
implore
the
protection
of
my
uncle
,
who
has
been
always
kind
and
compassionate
?
  
<EOS>
This
must
be
my
last
resource
.
  
<EOS>
I
dread
the
thoughts
of
making
him
uneasy
;
and
would
rather
suffer
a
thousand
deaths
than
live
the
cause
of
dissension
in
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
perceive
the
meaning
of
Wilson
's
coming
hither
:
 
<EOS>
perhaps
,
he
was
in
quest
of
us
,
in
order
to
disclose
his
real
name
and
situation
:
 
but
wherefore
pass
without
staying
to
make
the
least
inquiry
?
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Willis
,
I
am
lost
in
conjecture
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
closed
an
eye
since
I
saw
him
.
  
<EOS>
All
night
long
have
I
been
tossed
about
from
one
imagination
to
another
.
  
<EOS>
The
reflection
finds
no
resting
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
prayed
,
and
sighed
,
and
wept
plentifully
.
  
<EOS>
If
this
terrible
suspense
continues
much
longer
,
I
shall
have
another
fit
of
illness
,
and
then
the
whole
family
will
be
in
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
If
it
was
consistent
with
the
wise
purposes
of
Providence
,
would
I
were
in
my
grave
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
my
duty
to
be
resigned
.
  
<EOS>
My
dearest
Letty
,
excuse
my
weakness
 
excuse
these
blots
 
<EOS>
my
tears
fall
so
fast
that
I
can
not
keep
the
paper
dry
 
<EOS>
yet
I
ought
to
consider
that
I
have
as
yet
no
cause
to
despair
 
<EOS>
but
I
am
such
a
faint
-
hearted
timorous
creature
!
    
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
my
uncle
is
much
better
than
he
was
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
resolved
to
pursue
our
journey
strait
to
Wales
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
we
shall
take
Gloucester
in
our
way
 
that
hope
chears
my
poor
heart
  
<EOS>
I
shall
once
more
embrace
my
best
beloved
Willis
,
and
pour
all
my
griefs
into
her
friendly
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
O
heaven
!
<EOS>
is
it
possible
that
such
happiness
is
reserved
for
    
The
dejected

<EOS>
DEAR
WATKIN
,
I
YESTERDAY
met
with
an
incident
which
I
believe
you
will
own
to
be
very
surprising
  
<EOS>
As
I
stood
with
Liddy
at
the
window
of
the
inn
where
we
had
lodged
,
who
should
pass
by
but
<EOS>
Wilson
a
-
horseback
:
  
<EOS>
I
could
not
be
mistaken
in
the
person
,
for
I
had
a
full
view
of
him
as
he
advanced
;
I
plainly
perceived
by
my
sister
's
confusion
that
she
recognized
him
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
equally
astonished
and
incensed
at
his
appearance
,
which
I
could
not
but
interpret
into
an
insult
,
or
something
worse
.
<EOS>
I
ran
out
at
the
gate
,
and
,
seeing
him
turn
the
corner
of
the
street
,
I
dispatched
my
servant
to
observe
his
motions
,
but
the
fellow
was
too
late
to
bring
me
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
,
however
,
that
there
was
an
inn
,
called
the
Red
Lion
,
at
that
end
of
the
town
,
where
he
supposed
the
horseman
had
alighted
,
but
that
the
would
not
enquire
without
further
orders
.
<EOS>
I
sent
him
back
immediately
to
know
what
strangers
were
in
the
house
,
and
he
returned
with
a
report
that
there
was
one
Mr
Wilson
lately
arrived
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
information
I
charged
him
with
a
note
directed
to
that
gentleman
,
desiring
him
to
meet
me
in
half
an
hour
in
a
certain
field
at
the
town
's
end
,
with
a
case
of
pistols
,
in
order
to
decide
the
difference
which
could
not
be
determined
at
our
last
rencounter
:
but
I
did
not
think
proper
to
subscribe
the
billet
.
<EOS>
My
man
assured
me
he
had
delivered
it
into
his
own
hand
;
and
,
that
having
read
it
,
he
declared
he
would
wait
upon
the
gentleman
at
the
place
and
time
appointed
.
    
<EOS>
M'Alpine
being
an
old
soldier
,
and
luckily
sober
at
the
time
,
I
entrusted
him
with
my
secret
.
<EOS>
I
ordered
him
to
be
within
call
,
and
,
having
given
him
a
letter
to
be
delivered
to
my
uncle
in
case
of
accident
,
I
repaired
to
the
rendezvous
,
which
was
an
inclosed
field
at
a
little
distance
from
the
highway
.
<EOS>
I
found
my
antagonist
had
already
taken
his
ground
,
wrapped
in
a
dark
horseman
's
coat
,
with
a
laced
hat
flapped
over
his
eyes
;
but
what
was
my
astonishment
,
when
,
throwing
off
this
wrapper
,
he
appeared
to
be
a
person
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
!
<EOS>
He
had
one
pistol
stuck
in
a
leather
belt
,
and
another
in
his
hand
ready
for
action
,
and
,
advancing
a
few
steps
,
called
to
know
if
I
was
ready
  
<EOS>
I
answered
,
"
No
,
"
and
desired
a
parley
:
upon
which
he
turned
the
muzzle
of
his
piece
towards
the
earth
;
then
replaced
it
in
his
belt
,
and
met
me
half
way
  
<EOS>
When
I
assured
him
he
was
not
the
man
I
expected
to
meet
<EOS>
,
he
said
,
it
might
be
so
:
that
he
had
received
a
slip
of
paper
directed
to
Mr
Wilson
,
requesting
him
to
come
hither
;
and
that
as
there
was
no
other
in
the
place
of
that
name
,
he
naturally
concluded
the
note
was
intended
for
him
,
and
him
only
  
<EOS>
I
then
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
I
had
been
injured
by
a
person
who
assumed
that
name
,
which
person
I
had
actually
seen
within
the
hour
,
passing
through
the
street
on
horseback
;
that
hearing
there
was
a
Mr
Wilson
at
the
Red
Lion
<EOS>
,
I
took
it
for
granted
<EOS>
he
was
the
man
,
and
in
that
belief
had
writ
the
billet
;
and
I
expressed
my
surprize
,
that
he
,
who
was
a
stranger
to
me
and
my
concerns
,
should
give
me
such
a
rendezvous
,
without
taking
the
trouble
to
demand
a
previous
explanation
  
<EOS>
He
replied
,
that
there
was
no
other
of
his
name
in
the
whole
county
;
that
no
such
horseman
had
alighted
at
the
Red
Lion
since
nine
o'clock
,
when
he
arrived
 
that
having
had
the
honour
to
serve
his
majesty
,
he
thought
he
could
not
decently
decline
any
invitation
of
this
kind
,
from
what
quarter
soever
it
might
come
;
and
that
if
any
explanation
was
necessary
,
it
did
not
belong
to
him
to
demand
it
,
but
to
the
gentleman
who
summoned
him
into
the
field
  
<EOS>
Vexed
as
I
was
at
this
adventure
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
help
admiring
the
coolness
of
this
officer
,
whose
open
countenance
prepossessed
me
in
his
favour
.
  
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
be
turned
of
forty
;
wore
his
own
short
black
hair
,
which
curled
naturally
about
his
ears
,
and
was
very
plain
in
his
apparel
  
When
I
begged
pardon
for
the
trouble
I
had
given
him
,
he
received
my
apology
with
great
good
humour
.
  
<EOS>
He
told
me
that
he
lived
about
ten
miles
off
,
at
a
small
farm
-
house
,
which
would
afford
me
tolerable
lodging
,
if
I
would
come
and
take
the
diversion
of
hunting
with
him
for
a
few
weeks
;
in
which
case
we
might
,
perhaps
,
find
out
the
man
who
had
given
me
offence
  
<EOS>
I
thanked
him
very
sincerely
for
his
courteous
offer
,
which
,
I
told
him
,
I
was
not
at
liberty
to
accept
at
present
,
on
account
of
my
being
engaged
in
a
family
partie
;
and
so
we
parted
,
with
mutual
professions
of
good
will
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
Now
tell
me
,
dear
knight
,
what
am
I
to
make
of
this
singular
adventure
?
  
<EOS>
Am
I
to
suppose
that
the
horseman
I
saw
was
really
a
thing
of
flesh
and
blood
,
or
a
bubble
that
vanished
into
air
?
 
<EOS>
or
must
I
imagine
Liddy
knows
more
of
the
matter
than
she
choose
to
disclose
?
  
<EOS>
If
I
thought
her
capable
of
carrying
on
any
clandestine
correspondence
with
such
a
fellow
,
I
should
at
once
discard
all
tenderness
,
and
forget
that
she
was
connected
with
me
by
the
ties
of
blood
  
<EOS>
But
how
is
it
possible
that
a
girl
of
her
simplicity
and
inexperience
,
should
maintain
such
an
intercouse
,
surrounded
,
as
she
is
,
with
so
many
eyes
,
destitute
of
all
opportunity
,
and
shifting
quarters
every
day
of
her
life
!
  
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
has
solemnly
promised
 
<EOS>
No
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
the
girl
so
base
 
<EOS>
so
insensible
to
the
honour
of
her
family
.
  
<EOS>
What
disturbs
me
chiefly
,
is
the
impression
which
these
occurrences
seem
to
make
upon
her
spirits
  
<EOS>
These
are
the
symptoms
from
which
I
conclude
that
the
rascal
has
still
a
hold
on
her
affection
 
<EOS>
surely
I
have
a
right
to
call
him
a
rascal
,
and
to
conclude
that
his
designs
are
infamous
  
<EOS>
But
it
shall
be
my
fault
if
he
does
not
one
day
repent
his
presumption
  
<EOS>
I
confess
I
can
not
think
,
much
less
write
on
this
subject
,
with
any
degree
of
temper
or
patience
;
I
shall
therefore
conclude
with
telling
you
,
that
we
hope
to
be
in
Wales
by
the
latter
end
of
the
month
:
<EOS>
but
before
that
period
you
will
probably
hear
again
from
    
your
affectionate
J
Melford
.
    
Oct.
4
.
    
<EOS>
To
Sir
Watkin
Phillips
,
Bart
.
<EOS>
at
Oxon
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
PHILLIPS
,
WHEN
I
wrote
to
you
by
last
post
,
I
did
not
imagine
I
should
be
tempted
to
trouble
you
again
so
soon
:
but
I
now
sit
down
with
a
heart
so
full
that
it
can
not
contain
itself
;
though
I
am
under
such
agitation
of
spirits
,
that
you
are
to
expect
neither
method
or
connexion
in
this
address
  
<EOS>
We
have
been
this
day
within
a
hair
's
breath
of
losing
honest
Mathew
Bramble
,
in
consequence
of
a
cursed
accident
,
which
I
will
endeavour
to
explain
.
  
<EOS>
In
crossing
the
country
to
get
into
the
post
road
,
it
was
necessary
to
ford
a
river
,
and
we
that
were
a
-
horseback
passed
without
any
danger
on
difficulty
;
but
a
great
quantity
of
rain
having
fallen
last
night
and
this
morning
,
there
was
such
an
accumulation
of
water
,
that
a
mill
-
head
gave
way
,
just
as
the
coach
was
passing
under
it
,
and
the
flood
rushed
down
with
such
impetuosity
,
as
first
floated
,
and
then
fairly
overturned
the
carriage
in
the
middle
of
the
stream
  
Lismahago
and
I
,
and
the
two
servants
,
alighting
instantaneously
,
ran
into
the
river
to
give
all
the
assistance
in
our
power
.
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
,
Mrs
Tabitha
,
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
uppermost
,
was
already
half
way
out
of
the
coach
window
,
when
her
lover
approaching
,
disengaged
her
entirely
;
but
,
whether
his
foot
slipt
or
the
burden
was
too
great
,
they
fell
over
head
and
ears
in
each
others
arms
.
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
more
than
once
to
get
up
,
and
even
to
disentagle
himself
from
her
embrace
,
but
she
hung
about
his
neck
like
a
mill
-
stone
(
no
bad
emblem
of
matrimony
,
)
and
if
my
man
had
not
proved
a
staunch
auxiliary
,
those
two
lovers
would
in
all
probability
have
gone
hand
in
hand
to
the
shades
below
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
was
too
much
engaged
to
take
any
cognizance
of
their
distress
.
  
<EOS>
I
snatched
out
my
sister
by
the
hair
of
the
head
,
and
,
dragging
her
to
the
bank
,
recollected
that
my
uncle
had
not
yet
appeared
  
Rushing
again
into
the
stream
,
I
met
Clinker
hauling
ashore
<EOS>
Mrs
Jenkins
,
who
looked
like
a
mermaid
with
her
hair
dishevelled
about
her
ears
;
but
,
when
I
asked
if
his
master
was
safe
,
he
forthwith
shook
her
from
him
,
and
she
must
have
gone
to
pot
,
if
a
miller
had
not
seasonably
come
to
her
relief
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Humphry
,
he
flew
like
lightning
to
the
coach
,
that
was
by
this
time
filled
with
water
,
and
,
diving
into
it
,
brought
up
the
poor
"
squire
,
to
all
appearance
,
deprived
of
life
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
in
my
power
to
describe
what
I
felt
at
this
melancholy
spectacle
  
<EOS>
it
was
such
an
agony
as
baffles
all
description
!
<EOS>
The
faithful
Clinker
,
taking
him
up
in
his
arms
,
as
if
he
had
been
an
infant
of
six
months
,
carried
him
ashore
,
howling
most
petiously
all
the
way
,
and
I
followed
him
in
a
transport
of
grief
and
consternation
  
<EOS>
When
he
was
laid
upon
the
grass
,
and
turned
from
side
to
side
,
a
great
quantity
of
water
ran
out
at
his
mouth
,
then
he
opened
his
eyes
,
and
fetched
a
deep
sigh
  
Clinker
perceiving
these
signs
of
life
,
immediately
tied
up
his
arm
with
a
garter
,
and
,
pulling
out
a
horse
-
sleam
,
let
him
blood
in
the
farrier
stile
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
a
few
drops
only
issued
from
the
orifice
;
but
the
limb
being
chafed
,
in
a
little
time
the
blood
began
to
flow
in
a
continued
stream
,
and
he
uttered
some
incoherent
words
,
which
were
the
most
welcome
sounds
that
ever
saluted
my
ear
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
country
inn
heard
by
,
the
landlord
of
which
had
by
this
time
come
with
his
people
to
give
their
assistance
.
  
<EOS>
Thither
my
uncle
being
carried
,
was
undressed
and
put
to
bed
,
wrapped
in
warm
blankets
;
but
having
been
moved
too
soon
,
he
fainted
away
,
and
once
more
lay
without
sense
or
motion
,
notwithstanding
all
the
efforts
of
Clinker
and
the
landlord
,
who
bathed
his
temples
with
Hungary
water
,
and
held
a
smelling
bottle
to
his
nose
.
<EOS>
As
I
had
heared
of
the
efficacy
of
salt
in
such
cases
,
I
ordered
all
that
was
in
the
house
to
be
laid
under
his
head
and
body
;
and
whither
this
application
had
the
desired
effect
,
or
nature
of
herself
prevailed
,
he
,
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
began
to
breathe
regularly
,
and
soon
retrieved
his
recollection
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
all
the
by
-
standers
.
<EOS>
As
for
Clinker
,
his
brain
seemed
to
be
affected
.
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
,
and
wept
,
and
danced
about
in
such
a
distracted
manner
,
that
the
landlord
very
judiciously
conveyed
him
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
,
seeing
me
dropping
wet
,
comprehended
the
whole
of
what
had
happened
,
and
asked
if
all
the
company
was
safe
?
  
<EOS>
Being
answered
in
all
the
affirmative
,
he
insisted
on
my
putting
on
dry
clothes
?
<EOS>
and
,
having
swallowed
a
little
warm
wine
,
desired
he
might
be
left
to
his
repose
.
<EOS>
Before
I
went
to
shift
myself
,
I
inquired
about
the
rest
of
the
family
  
<EOS>
I
found
Mrs
Tabitha
still
delirious
from
her
fright
,
discharging
very
copiously
the
water
she
had
swallowed
.
<EOS>
She
was
supported
by
the
captain
,
distilling
drops
from
his
uncurled
periwig
,
so
lank
and
so
dank
,
that
he
looked
like
father
Thame
without
his
sedges
,
embracing
Isis
,
while
she
cascaded
in
his
urn
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Jenkins
was
present
also
,
in
a
loose
bedgown
,
without
either
cap
or
handkerchief
;
but
she
seemed
to
be
as
little
compos
mentis
as
her
mistress
,
and
acted
so
many
cross
purposes
in
the
course
of
her
attendance
,
that
,
between
the
two
,
Lismahago
had
occasion
for
all
his
philosophy
.
<EOS>
As
for
Liddy
,
I
thought
the
poor
girl
would
have
actually
lost
her
senses
.
<EOS>
The
good
woman
of
the
house
had
shifted
her
linen
,
and
put
her
into
bed
;
but
she
was
seized
with
the
idea
that
her
uncle
had
perished
,
and
in
this
persuasion
made
a
dismal
out
-
cry
;
nor
did
she
pay
the
least
regard
to
what
I
said
,
when
I
solemnly
assured
her
he
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
hearing
the
noise
,
and
being
informed
of
her
apprehension
,
desired
she
might
be
brought
into
his
chamber
;
and
she
no
sooner
received
this
intimation
,
than
she
ran
thither
half
naked
,
with
the
wildest
expression
of
eagerness
in
her
countenance
  
Seeing
the
"
squire
sitting
up
in
the
bed
,
she
sprung
forwards
,
and
,
throwing
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
exclaimed
in
a
most
pathetic
tone
,
"
<EOS>
Are
you
 
<EOS>
Are
you
indeed
my
uncle
 
<EOS>
My
dear
uncle
!
 
<EOS>
My
best
friend
!
<EOS>
My
father
!
  
<EOS>
Are
you
really
living
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
an
illusion
of
my
poor
brain
!
"
<EOS>
Honest
Matthew
was
so
much
affected
,
that
he
could
not
help
shedding
tears
,
while
he
kissed
her
forehead
,
saying
,
"
My
dear
Liddy
,
I
hope
I
shall
live
long
enough
to
shew
how
sensible
I
am
of
your
affection
  
<EOS>
But
your
spirits
are
fluttered
,
child
  
<EOS>
You
want
rest
  
<EOS>
Go
to
bed
and
compose
yourself
  
<EOS>
Well
,
I
will
(
she
replied
)
 
but
still
methinks
<EOS>
this
can
not
be
real
  
<EOS>
The
coach
was
full
of
water
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
was
under
us
all
  
Gracious
God
!
  
<EOS>
You
was
under
water
  
<EOS>
How
did
you
get
out
?
 
<EOS>
tell
me
that
?
<EOS>
or
I
shall
think
this
is
all
a
deception
 
"
<EOS>
"
In
what
manner
I
was
brought
out
,
I
know
as
little
as
you
do
,
my
dear
(
said
the
"
squire
)
;
and
truly
that
is
a
circumstance
of
which
I
want
to
be
informed
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
have
given
him
a
detail
of
the
whole
adventure
,
but
he
would
not
hear
me
until
I
should
change
my
clothes
;
so
that
I
had
only
time
to
tell
him
,
that
he
owed
his
life
to
the
courage
and
fidelity
of
Clinker
;
and
having
given
him
this
hint
,
I
conducted
my
sister
to
her
own
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
This
accident
happened
about
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
in
little
more
than
an
hour
the
hurricane
was
all
over
;
but
as
the
carriage
was
found
to
be
so
much
damaged
,
that
it
could
not
proceed
without
considerable
repairs
,
a
blacksmith
and
wheelwright
were
immediately
sent
for
to
the
next
market
-
town
,
and
we
congratulated
ourselves
upon
being
housed
at
an
inn
,
which
,
though
remote
from
the
post
-
road
,
afforded
exceeding
good
lodging
.
<EOS>
The
women
being
pretty
well
composed
,
and
the
men
all
a
-
foot
,
my
uncle
sent
for
his
servant
,
and
,
in
the
presence
of
Lismahago
and
me
,
accosted
him
in
these
words
  
"
<EOS>
So
,
Clinker
,
I
find
you
are
resolved
I
sha
n't
die
by
water
  
<EOS>
As
you
have
fished
me
up
from
the
bottom
at
your
own
risque
,
you
are
at
least
entitled
to
all
the
money
that
was
in
my
pocket
,
and
there
it
is
 
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
presented
him
with
a
purse
containing
thirty
guineas
,
and
a
ring
nearly
of
the
same
value
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Clinker
)
<EOS>
your
honour
shall
excuse
me
  
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
fellow
;
but
I
have
a
heart
  
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
if
your
honour
did
but
know
how
I
rejoiced
to
see
  
<EOS>
Blessed
be
his
holy
name
,
that
made
me
the
humble
instrument
  
<EOS>
But
as
for
the
lucre
of
gain
,
I
renounce
it
  
<EOS>
I
have
done
no
more
than
my
duty
  
<EOS>
No
more
than
I
would
have
done
for
the
most
worthless
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
  
<EOS>
No
more
than
I
would
have
done
for
captain
Lismahago
,
or
Archy
Macalpine
,
or
any
sinner
upon
earth
  
<EOS>
But
for
your
worship
,
I
would
go
through
fire
as
well
as
water
 
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
believe
it
,
Humphry
(
said
the
"
squire
)
;
but
as
you
think
it
was
your
duty
to
save
my
life
at
the
hazard
of
your
own
,
I
think
it
is
mine
to
express
the
sense
I
have
of
your
extraordinary
fidelity
and
attachment
  
<EOS>
I
insist
upon
your
receiving
this
small
token
of
my
gratitude
;
but
do
n't
imagine
that
I
look
upon
this
as
an
adequate
recompense
for
the
service
you
have
done
me
  
<EOS>
I
have
determined
to
settle
thirty
pounds
a
-
year
upon
you
for
life
;
and
I
desire
these
gentlemen
will
bear
witness
to
this
my
intention
,
of
which
I
have
a
memorandum
in
my
pocketbook
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
make
me
thankful
for
all
these
mercies
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Clinker
,
sobbing
)
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
poor
bankrupt
from
the
beginning
 
your
honour
's
goodness
found
me
,
when
I
was
 
<EOS>
naked
  
when
I
was
 
sick
and
forlorn
  
<EOS>
I
understand
your
honour
's
looks
  
I
would
not
give
offence
 
<EOS>
but
my
heart
is
very
full
 
and
if
your
worship
wo
n't
give
me
leave
to
speak
,
 
I
must
vent
it
in
prayers
to
heaven
for
my
benefactor
.
<EOS>
"
When
he
quitted
the
room
,
Lismahago
said
,
he
should
have
a
much
better
opinion
of
his
honesty
,
if
he
did
not
whine
and
ca
nt
so
abominably
;
but
that
he
had
always
observed
those
weeping
and
praying
follows
were
hypocrites
at
bottem
.
<EOS>
Mr
Bramble
made
no
reply
to
this
sarcastic
remark
,
proceeding
from
the
lieutenant
's
resentment
of
Clinker
's
having
,
in
pure
simplicity
of
heart
,
ranked
him
with
M'Alpine
and
the
sinners
of
the
earth
,
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
being
called
to
receive
some
orders
about
the
beds
,
told
the
"
squire
that
his
house
was
very
much
at
his
service
,
but
he
was
sure
he
should
not
have
the
honour
to
lodge
him
and
his
company
.
<EOS>
He
gave
us
to
understand
that
his
master
,
who
lived
hard
by
,
would
not
suffer
us
to
be
at
a
publick
house
,
when
there
was
accommodation
for
us
at
his
own
;
and
that
,
if
he
had
not
dined
abroad
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
would
have
undoubtedly
come
to
offer
his
services
at
our
first
arrival
.
<EOS>
He
then
launched
out
in
praise
of
that
gentleman
,
whom
he
had
served
as
butler
,
representing
him
as
a
perfect
miracle
of
goodness
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
a
person
of
great
learning
,
and
allowed
to
be
the
best
farmer
in
the
country
:
 
that
he
had
a
lady
who
was
as
much
beloved
as
himself
,
and
an
only
son
,
a
very
hopeful
young
gentleman
,
just
recovered
from
a
dangerous
fever
,
which
had
like
to
have
proved
fatal
to
the
whole
family
;
for
,
if
the
son
had
died
,
he
was
sure
the
parents
would
not
have
survived
their
loss
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
finished
the
encomium
of
Mr
Dennison
,
when
this
gentleman
arrived
in
a
postchaise
,
and
his
appearance
seemed
to
justify
all
that
had
been
said
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
is
pretty
well
advanced
in
years
,
but
hale
,
robust
,
and
florid
,
with
an
ingenuous
countenance
,
expressive
of
good
sense
and
humanity
.
<EOS>
Having
condoled
with
us
on
the
accident
which
had
happened
,
he
said
he
was
come
to
conduct
us
to
his
habitation
,
where
we
should
be
less
incommoded
than
at
such
a
paultry
inn
,
and
expressed
his
hope
that
the
ladies
would
not
be
the
worse
for
going
thither
in
his
carriage
,
as
the
distance
was
not
above
a
quarter
of
mile
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
having
made
a
proper
return
to
this
courteous
exhibition
,
eyed
him
attentively
,
and
then
asked
if
he
had
not
been
at
Oxford
,
a
commoner
of
Queen
's
college
?
<EOS>
When
Mr
Dennison
answered
,
"
Yes
,
"
with
some
marks
of
surprise
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
then
(
said
our
"
squire
)
and
let
us
see
if
you
can
recollect
the
features
of
an
old
friend
,
whom
you
have
not
seen
these
forty
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
gentleman
,
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
and
gazing
at
him
earnestly
,
 
"
I
protest
,
(
cried
he
,
)
<EOS>
I
do
think
I
recall
the
idea
of
Matthew
Loyd
of
Glamorganshire
,
who
was
student
of
Jesus
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
remembered
,
my
dear
friend
,
Charles
Dennison
,
(
exclaimed
my
uncle
,
pressing
him
to
his
brest
)
,
I
am
the
very
identical
Matthew
Loyd
of
Glamorgan
.
"
<EOS>
Clinker
,
who
had
just
entered
the
room
with
some
coals
for
the
fire
,
no
sooner
heard
these
words
,
than
,
throwing
down
the
scuttle
on
the
toes
of
Lismahago
,
he
began
to
caper
as
if
he
was
mad
,
crying
  
"
Matthew
Loyd
of
Glamorgan
!
  
<EOS>
O
Providence
!
  
<EOS>
Matthew
Loyd
of
Glamorgan
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
clasping
my
uncle
's
knees
,
he
went
on
in
this
manner
  
"
<EOS>
Your
worship
must
forgive
me
  
<EOS>
Matthew
Loyd
of
Glamorgan
!
  
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
Sir
!
  
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
contain
myself
!
  
<EOS>
I
shall
lose
my
senses
 
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
thou
hast
lost
them
already
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
(
said
the
"
squire
,
peevishly
)
prithee
Clinker
be
quiet
  
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
  
<EOS>
Humphery
,
fumbling
in
his
bosom
,
pulled
out
an
old
wooden
snuff
-
box
,
which
he
presented
in
great
trepidation
to
his
master
,
who
,
opening
it
immediately
,
perceived
a
small
cornelian
seal
,
and
two
scraps
of
paper
  
<EOS>
At
sight
of
these
articles
he
started
,
and
changed
colour
,
and
,
casting
his
eye
upon
the
inscriptions
  
"
Ha
!
 
<EOS>
how
!
 
<EOS>
what
!
 
<EOS>
where
(
cried
he
)
is
the
person
here
named
?
"
<EOS>
Clinker
,
knocking
his
own
breast
,
could
hardly
pronounce
these
words
  
"
Here
 
here
 
<EOS>
here
is
Matthew
Loyd
,
as
the
certificate
sheweth
  
Humphry
Clinker
was
the
name
of
the
farrier
that
took
me
"
prentice
"
  
"
And
who
gave
you
these
tokens
,
"
  
said
my
uncle
,
<EOS>
hastily
  
"
My
poor
mother
on
her
death
-
bed
"
 
replied
the
other
  
"
And
who
was
your
mother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dorothy
Twyford
,
an
"
please
your
honour
,
heretofore
bar
-
keeper
at
the
Angel
at
Chippenham
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
why
were
not
these
tokens
produced
before
?
"
<EOS>
"
My
mother
told
me
she
had
wrote
to
Glamorganshire
,
at
the
time
of
my
birth
,
but
had
no
answer
;
and
that
afterwards
,
when
she
made
enquiry
,
there
was
no
such
person
in
that
county
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
so
in
consequence
of
my
changing
my
name
and
going
abroad
at
that
very
time
,
the
poor
mother
and
thou
have
been
left
to
want
and
misery
  
<EOS>
I
am
really
shocked
at
the
consequence
of
my
own
folly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
laying
his
hand
on
Clinker
's
head
,
he
added
,
"
Stand
forth
,
Matthew
Loyd
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
gentlemen
,
how
the
sins
of
my
youth
rise
up
in
judgment
against
me
  
<EOS>
Here
is
my
direction
written
with
my
own
hand
,
and
a
seal
which
I
left
at
the
woman
's
request
;
and
this
is
a
certificate
of
the
child
's
baptism
,
signed
by
the
curate
of
the
parish
.
<EOS>
"
The
company
were
not
a
little
surprised
at
this
discovery
,
upon
which
Mr
Dennison
facetiously
congratulated
both
the
father
and
the
son
:
for
my
part
,
I
shook
my
new
found
cousin
heartily
by
the
hand
,
and
Lismahago
complimented
him
with
the
tears
in
his
eyes
,
for
he
had
been
hopping
about
the
room
,
swearing
in
broad
Scotch
,
and
bellowing
with
the
pain
occasioned
by
the
fall
of
the
coal
-
scuttle
upon
his
foot
.
<EOS>
He
had
even
vowed
to
drive
the
saul
out
of
the
body
of
that
mad
rascal
:
but
,
perceiving
the
unexpected
turn
which
things
had
taken
,
he
wished
him
joy
of
his
good
fortune
,
observing
that
it
went
very
near
his
heart
,
as
he
was
like
to
be
a
great
toe
out
of
pocket
by
the
discovery
  
Mr
Dennison
now
desired
to
know
for
what
reason
my
uncle
had
changed
the
name
by
which
he
knew
him
at
Oxford
,
and
our
"
squire
satisfied
him
,
by
answering
to
this
effect
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
my
mother
's
name
,
which
was
Loyd
,
as
heir
to
her
lands
in
Glamorganshire
;
but
,
when
I
came
of
age
,
I
sold
that
property
,
in
order
to
clear
my
paternal
estate
,
and
resumed
my
real
name
;
so
that
I
am
now
Matthew
Bramble
of
Brambleton
-
hall
in
Monmouthshire
,
at
your
service
;
and
this
is
my
nephew
Jeremy
Melford
of
Belfield
,
in
the
county
of
Glamorgan
.
<EOS>
"
At
that
instant
the
ladies
entered
the
room
,
he
presented
Mrs
Tabitha
as
his
sister
,
and
Liddy
as
his
niece
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
saluted
them
very
cordially
,
and
seemed
struck
with
the
appearance
of
my
sister
,
whom
he
could
not
help
surveying
with
a
mixture
of
complacency
and
surprize
  
<EOS>
"
Sister
,
(
said
my
uncle
)
<EOS>
there
is
a
poor
relation
that
recommends
himself
to
your
good
graces
  
<EOS>
The
quondam
Humphry
Clinker
is
methmorpaosed
into
Matthew
Loyd
;
and
claims
the
honour
of
being
your
carnal
kinsman
 
in
short
,
the
rogue
proves
to
be
a
crab
of
my
own
planting
in
the
days
of
hot
blood
and
unrestrained
libertinism
.
<EOS>
"
Clinker
had
by
this
time
dropt
upon
one
knee
,
by
the
side
of
Mrs
Tabitha
,
who
,
eyeing
him
askance
,
and
flirting
her
fan
with
marks
of
agitation
,
thought
proper
,
after
some
conflict
,
to
hold
out
her
hand
for
him
to
kiss
,
saying
,
with
a
demure
aspect
,
"
Brother
,
you
have
been
very
wicked
:
but
I
hope
you
'll
live
to
see
the
folly
of
your
ways
  
<EOS>
I
am
very
sorry
to
say
<EOS>
the
young
man
,
whom
you
have
this
day
acknowledged
,
has
more
grace
and
religion
,
by
the
gift
of
God
,
than
you
with
all
your
profane
learning
,
and
repeated
opportunity
  
<EOS>
I
do
think
he
has
got
the
trick
of
the
eye
,
and
the
tip
of
the
nose
of
my
uncle
Loyd
of
Flluydwellyn
and
as
for
the
long
chin
,
it
is
the
very
moral
of
the
governor
's
  
Brother
,
as
you
have
changed
his
name
,
pray
change
his
dress
also
;
that
livery
doth
not
become
any
person
that
hath
got
our
blood
in
his
veins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Liddy
seemed
much
pleased
with
this
acquisition
to
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
him
by
the
hand
,
declaring
she
should
always
be
proud
to
own
her
connexion
with
a
virtuous
young
man
,
who
had
given
so
many
proofs
of
his
gratitude
and
affection
to
her
uncle
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
extremely
fluttered
between
her
surprize
at
this
discovery
,
and
the
apprehension
of
losing
her
sweet
-
heart
,
exclaimed
in
a
giggling
tone
,
 
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
joy
,
Mr
Clinker
  
<EOS>
Floyd
 
I
would
say
 
hi

hi

hi

<EOS>
you
'll
be
so
proud
you
wo
n't
look
at
your
poor
fellow
servants

oh
,
oh
,
oh
!
"
<EOS>
Honest
Clinker
owned
he
was
overjoyed
at
his
good
fortune
,
which
was
greater
than
he
deserved
  
"
But
wherefore
should
I
be
proud
?
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
a
poor
object
conceived
in
sin
,
and
brought
forth
in
iniquity
,
nursed
in
a
parish
work
-
house
and
bred
in
a
smithy
  
<EOS>
Whenever
I
seem
proud
,
Mrs
Jenkins
,
I
beg
of
you
to
put
me
in
mind
of
the
condition
I
was
in
,
when
I
first
saw
you
between
Chippenham
and
Marlborough
.
"
    
<EOS>
When
this
momentous
affair
was
discussed
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
concerned
,
the
weather
being
dry
,
the
ladies
declined
the
carriage
;
so
that
we
walked
all
together
to
Mr
Dennison
's
house
,
where
we
found
the
tea
ready
prepared
by
his
lady
,
an
amiable
matron
,
who
received
us
with
all
the
benevolence
of
hospitality
.
  
<EOS>
The
house
is
old
fashioned
and
irregular
,
but
lodgeable
and
commodious
.
<EOS>
To
the
south
it
has
the
river
in
front
,
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
;
and
on
the
north
,
there
is
a
rising
ground
,
covered
with
an
agreeable
plantation
;
the
greens
and
walks
are
kept
in
the
nicest
order
,
and
all
is
rural
and
romantic
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
yet
seen
the
young
gentleman
,
who
is
on
a
visit
to
a
friend
in
the
neighbourhood
,
from
whose
house
he
is
not
expected
till
to
-
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
as
there
is
a
man
going
to
the
next
market
-
town
with
letters
for
the
post
,
I
take
this
opportunity
to
send
you
the
history
of
this
day
,
which
has
been
remarkably
full
of
adventures
;
and
you
will
own
<EOS>
I
give
you
them
like
a
beef
-
steak
at
Dolly
's
,
hot
and
hot
,
without
ceremony
and
parade
,
just
as
they
come
from
the
recollection
of
    
yours
,
J
Melford
.
    
<EOS>
To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
DEAR
DICK
,
SINCE
the
last
trouble
I
gave
you
,
I
have
met
with
a
variety
of
incidents
,
some
of
them
of
a
singular
nature
,
which
I
reserve
as
a
fund
for
conversation
;
but
there
are
others
so
interesting
,
that
they
will
not
keep
in
petto
till
meeting
.
    
<EOS>
Know
<EOS>
then
,
it
was
a
thousand
pounds
to
a
six
-
pence
,
that
you
should
now
be
executing
my
will
,
instead
of
perusing
my
letter
!
<EOS>
Two
days
ago
,
our
coach
was
overturned
in
the
midst
of
a
rapid
river
,
where
my
life
was
saved
with
the
utmost
difficulty
,
by
the
courage
,
activity
,
and
presence
of
mind
of
my
servant
Humphry
Clinker
  
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
most
surprising
circumstance
of
the
adventure
  
<EOS>
The
said
Humphry
Clinker
proves
to
be
Matthew
Loyd
,
natural
son
of
one
Matthew
Loyd
of
Glamorgan
,
of
<EOS>
you
know
any
such
person
  
<EOS>
You
see
,
Doctor
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
your
philosophy
,
it
is
not
without
some
reason
that
we
Welshmen
ascribe
such
energy
to
the
force
of
blood
  
<EOS>
But
we
shall
discuss
this
point
on
some
future
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
only
discovery
which
I
made
in
consequence
of
our
disaster
  
<EOS>
We
happened
to
be
wrecked
upon
a
friendly
shore
  
<EOS>
The
lord
of
the
manor
is
no
other
than
Charles
Dennison
,
our
fellow
-
rake
at
Oxford
  
<EOS>
We
are
now
happily
housed
with
that
gentleman
,
who
has
really
attained
to
that
pitch
of
rural
felicity
,
at
which
I
have
been
aspiring
these
twenty
years
in
vain
.
<EOS>
He
is
blessed
with
a
consort
,
whose
disposition
is
suited
to
his
own
in
all
respects
;
tender
,
generous
,
and
benevolent
  
<EOS>
She
,
moreover
,
possesses
an
uncommon
share
of
understanding
,
fortitude
,
and
discretion
,
and
is
admirably
qualified
to
be
his
companion
,
confidant
,
counseller
,
and
coadjutrix
.
<EOS>
These
excellent
persons
have
an
only
son
,
about
nineteen
years
of
age
,
just
such
a
youth
as
they
could
have
wished
that
Heaven
would
bestow
to
fill
up
the
measure
of
their
enjoyment
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
they
know
no
other
allay
to
their
happiness
,
but
their
apprehension
and
anxiety
about
the
life
and
concern
,
of
this
beloved
object
.
    
<EOS>
Our
old
friend
,
who
had
the
misfortune
to
be
a
second
brother
,
was
bred
to
the
law
,
and
even
called
to
the
bar
;
but
he
did
not
find
himself
qualified
to
shine
in
that
province
,
and
had
very
little
inclination
for
his
profession
  
<EOS>
He
disobliged
his
father
,
by
marrying
for
love
,
without
any
consideration
of
fortune
;
so
that
he
had
little
or
no
-
think
to
depend
upon
for
some
years
but
his
practice
,
which
afforded
him
a
bare
subsistance
;
and
the
prospect
of
an
increasing
family
,
began
to
give
him
disturbance
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
his
father
dying
,
was
succeeded
by
his
elder
brother
,
a
fox
-
hunter
,
and
a
sot
,
who
neglected
his
affairs
,
insulted
and
oppressed
his
servants
,
and
in
a
few
years
had
well
nigh
ruined
the
estate
,
when
he
was
happily
carried
off
by
a
fever
,
the
immediate
consequence
of
a
debauch
.
<EOS>
Charles
,
with
the
approbation
of
his
wife
,
immediately
determined
to
quit
business
,
and
retire
into
the
country
,
although
this
resolution
was
strenuously
and
zealously
opposed
by
every
individual
,
whom
he
consulted
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Those
who
had
tried
the
experiment
,
assured
him
that
he
could
not
pretend
to
breathe
in
the
country
for
less
than
the
double
of
what
his
estate
produced
;
that
,
in
order
to
be
upon
the
footing
of
a
gentleman
,
he
would
be
obliged
to
keep
horses
,
hounds
,
carriages
,
with
a
suitable
number
of
servants
,
and
maintain
an
elegant
table
for
the
entertainment
of
his
neighbours
;
the
farming
was
a
mystery
,
known
only
to
those
who
had
been
bred
up
to
it
from
the
cradle
,
the
success
of
it
depending
not
only
upon
skill
and
industry
,
but
also
upon
such
attention
and
oeconomy
as
no
gentleman
could
be
supposed
to
give
or
practice
;
accordingly
every
attempt
made
by
gentlemen
miscarried
,
and
not
a
few
had
been
ruined
by
their
prosecution
of
agriculture
  
<EOS>
Nay
,
they
affirmed
that
he
would
find
it
cheaper
to
buy
hay
and
oats
for
his
cattle
,
and
to
go
to
market
for
poultry
,
eggs
,
kitchen
herbs
,
and
roots
,
and
every
the
most
inconsiderable
article
of
house
-
keeping
,
than
to
have
those
articles
produced
on
his
own
ground
.
    
<EOS>
These
objections
did
not
deter
Mr
Dennison
,
because
they
were
chiefly
founded
on
the
supposition
,
that
he
would
be
obliged
to
lead
a
life
of
extravagance
and
dissipation
,
which
he
and
his
consort
equally
detested
,
despised
,
and
determined
to
avoid
  
<EOS>
The
objects
he
had
in
view
,
were
health
of
body
,
peace
of
mind
,
and
the
private
satisfaction
of
domestic
quiet
,
unallyed
by
actual
want
,
and
uninterrupted
by
the
fears
of
indigence
  
<EOS>
He
was
very
moderate
in
his
estimate
of
the
necessaries
,
and
even
of
the
comforts
of
life
  
<EOS>
He
required
nothing
but
wholsome
air
,
pure
water
,
agreeable
exercise
,
plain
diet
,
convenient
lodging
,
and
decent
apparel
.
<EOS>
He
reflected
,
that
if
a
peasant
without
education
,
or
any
great
share
of
natural
sagacity
,
could
maintain
a
large
family
,
and
even
become
opulent
upon
a
farm
,
for
which
he
payed
an
annual
rent
of
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
to
the
landlord
,
surely
he
himself
might
hope
for
some
success
from
his
industry
,
having
no
rent
to
pay
<EOS>
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
three
or
four
hundered
pounds
a
-
year
to
receive
  
<EOS>
He
considered
,
that
the
earth
was
an
indulgent
mother
<EOS>
,
that
yielded
her
fruits
to
all
her
children
without
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
had
studied
the
theory
of
agriculture
with
a
degree
of
eagerness
and
delight
;
and
he
could
not
conceive
there
was
any
mystery
in
the
practice
,
but
what
he
should
be
able
to
disclose
by
dint
of
care
and
application
.
<EOS>
With
respect
to
houshould
expence
,
he
entered
into
a
minute
detail
and
investigation
,
by
which
he
perceived
the
assertions
of
his
friends
were
altogether
erroneous
  
<EOS>
He
found
he
should
save
sixty
pounds
a
-
year
in
the
single
article
of
house
-
rent
,
and
as
much
more
in
pocket
-
money
and
contingencies
;
that
even
butcher's
-
meat
was
twenty
per
cent
.
<EOS>
cheaper
in
the
country
than
in
London
;
but
that
poultry
,
and
almost
every
other
circumstance
of
house
-
keeping
,
might
be
had
for
less
than
one
half
of
what
they
cost
in
town
;
besides
,
a
considerable
saving
on
the
side
of
dress
,
in
being
delivered
from
the
oppressive
imposition
of
ridiculous
modes
,
invented
by
ignorance
,
and
adobted
by
folly
.
    
<EOS>
As
to
the
danger
of
vying
with
the
rich
in
pomp
and
equipage
,
it
never
gave
him
the
least
disturbance
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
turned
of
forty
,
and
,
having
lived
half
that
time
in
the
busy
scenes
of
life
,
was
well
skilled
in
the
science
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
There
can
not
be
in
nature
a
more
contemptible
figure
than
that
of
man
,
who
with
five
hundered
a
year
presumes
to
rival
in
expence
a
neighbour
who
possesses
five
times
that
income
  
<EOS>
His
ostentation
,
far
from
concealing
,
seves
only
to
discover
his
indigence
,
and
render
his
vanity
the
more
shocking
;
for
it
attracts
the
eyes
of
censure
,
and
excites
the
spirit
of
inquiry
.
<EOS>
There
is
not
a
family
in
the
county
,
nor
a
servant
in
his
own
house
,
nor
a
farmer
in
the
parish
,
but
what
knows
the
utmost
farthing
that
his
lands
produce
,
and
all
these
behold
him
with
scorn
or
compassion
.
<EOS>
I
am
surprised
that
these
reflections
do
not
occur
to
persons
in
this
unhappy
dilemma
,
and
produce
a
salutary
effect
;
but
the
truth
is
,
of
all
the
passions
incident
to
human
man
nature
,
vanity
is
that
which
most
effectually
perverts
the
faculties
of
the
understanding
;
nay
,
it
sometimes
becomes
so
incredibly
depraved
,
as
to
aspire
at
infamy
,
and
find
pleasure
in
bearing
the
stigmas
of
reproach
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
now
given
you
a
sketch
of
the
character
and
situation
of
Mr
Dennison
,
when
he
came
down
to
take
possession
of
his
estate
;
but
as
the
messenger
,
who
carries
the
letters
to
the
next
town
is
just
setting
off
,
I
shall
reserve
what
further
I
have
to
say
on
this
subject
,
till
the
next
post
,
when
you
shall
certainly
hear
from
    
yours
always

To
Dr
Lewis
.
  
<EOS>
ONCE
more
dear
doctor
,
I
resume
the
pen
for
your
amusement
  
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
morning
after
our
arrival
that
,
walking
out
with
my
friend
,
Mr
Dennison
,
I
could
not
help
breaking
forth
into
the
warmest
expressions
of
applause
at
the
beauty
of
the
scence
,
which
is
really
inchanting
;
and
I
signified
,
in
particular
,
how
much
I
was
pleased
with
the
disposition
of
some
detached
groves
,
that
afforded
at
once
shelter
and
ornament
to
his
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
"
When
I
took
possession
of
these
lands
,
about
two
and
twenty
years
ago
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
there
was
not
a
tree
standing
within
a
mile
of
the
house
,
except
those
of
an
old
neglected
orchard
,
which
produced
nothing
but
leaves
and
moss
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
gloomy
month
of
November
,
when
I
arrived
,
and
found
the
house
in
such
a
condition
,
that
it
might
have
been
justly
stiled
the
tower
of
desolution
.
  
<EOS>
The
court
-
yard
was
covered
with
nettles
and
docks
,
and
the
garden
exhibited
such
a
rank
plantation
of
weeds
as
I
had
never
seen
before
;
 
the
window
-
shutters
were
falling
in
pieces
;
 
the
sashes
broken
;
 
and
owls
and
jack
-
daws
had
taken
possession
of
the
chimnies
.
  
<EOS>
The
prospect
within
was
still
more
dreary
.
  
<EOS>
All
was
dark
,
and
damp
and
dirty
beyond
description
;
  
<EOS>
the
rain
penetrated
in
several
parts
of
the
roof
;
 
in
some
apartments
the
very
floors
had
given
way
;
 
the
hangings
were
parted
from
the
walls
,
and
shaking
in
mouldy
remnants
;
 
the
glasses
were
dropping
out
of
their
frames
;
 
the
family
-
pictures
were
covered
with
dust
;
 
and
all
the
chairs
and
tables
worm
-
eaten
and
crazy
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
bed
in
the
house
that
could
be
used
,
except
one
old
-
fashioned
machine
,
with
a
high
gilt
tester
,
and
fringed
curtains
of
yellow
mohair
,
which
had
been
,
for
aught
I
know
,
two
centuries
in
the
family
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
was
no
furniture
but
the
utensils
of
the
kitchen
;
and
the
cellar
afforded
nothing
but
a
few
empty
butts
and
barrels
,
that
stunk
so
abominably
,
that
I
would
not
suffer
any
body
to
enter
it
until
I
had
slashed
a
considerable
quanity
of
gun
-
powder
to
qualify
the
foul
air
within
.
    
<EOS>
"
An
old
cottager
and
his
wife
,
who
were
hired
to
lie
in
the
house
,
had
left
it
with
precipitation
,
alledging
,
among
other
causes
of
retreat
,
that
they
could
not
sleep
for
frightful
noises
,
and
that
my
poor
brother
certainly
walked
after
his
death
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
house
appeared
uninhabitable
;
the
barn
,
stable
,
and
our
houses
were
in
ruins
;
all
the
fences
broken
down
,
and
the
fields
lying
waste
.
    
<EOS>
"
The
farmer
who
kept
the
key
never
dreamed
I
had
any
intention
to
live
upon
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
He
rented
a
farm
of
sixty
pounds
,
and
his
lease
was
just
expiring
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
formed
a
scheme
of
being
appointed
bailiff
to
the
estate
,
and
of
converting
the
house
and
the
adjacent
grounds
to
his
own
use
.
  
<EOS>
A
hint
of
his
intention
I
received
from
the
curate
at
my
first
arrival
;
I
therefore
did
not
pay
much
regard
to
what
he
said
by
way
of
discouraging
me
from
coming
to
settle
in
the
country
;
but
I
was
a
little
startled
when
he
gave
me
warning
that
he
should
quit
the
farm
at
the
expiration
of
his
lease
,
unless
I
would
abate
considerably
in
the
rent
.
    
<EOS>
"
At
this
period
I
accidentally
became
acquainted
with
a
person
,
whose
friendship
laid
the
foundation
of
all
my
prosperity
.
<EOS>
In
the
next
market
-
town
,
I
chanced
to
dine
at
an
inn
with
a
Mr
Wilson
,
who
was
lately
come
to
settle
in
the
neighbourhood
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
lieutenant
of
a
man
of
war
;
but
quitted
the
sea
in
some
disgust
,
and
married
the
only
daughter
of
farmer
Bland
,
who
lives
in
this
parish
,
and
has
acquired
a
good
fortune
in
the
way
of
husbandry
.
  
<EOS>
Wilson
is
one
of
the
best
natured
men
I
ever
knew
;
brave
,
frank
,
obliging
,
and
ingenous
.
  
<EOS>
He
liked
my
conversation
,
I
was
charmed
with
his
liberal
manner
;
an
acquaintance
immediately
commenced
,
and
this
was
soon
improved
into
a
frendship
without
reserve
  
<EOS>
There
are
characters
which
,
like
similar
particulars
of
matter
strongly
attract
each
other
  
<EOS>
He
forthwith
introduced
me
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
farmer
Bland
,
who
was
well
acquainted
with
every
acre
of
my
estate
,
of
consequence
well
qualified
to
advise
me
on
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
<EOS>
I
was
inclined
to
embrace
a
country
life
,
and
even
to
amuse
myself
with
the
occupations
of
farming
,
he
approved
of
my
design
  
<EOS>
He
gave
me
to
understand
that
all
my
farms
were
underlet
;
that
the
estate
was
capable
of
great
improvement
;
that
there
was
plenty
of
chalk
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
that
my
own
ground
produced
excellent
marle
for
manure
.
  
<EOS>
With
respect
to
the
farm
,
which
was
like
to
fall
into
my
hands
,
he
said
he
would
willingly
take
it
at
the
present
rent
;
but
at
the
same
time
owned
,
that
if
I
would
expend
two
hundred
pounds
in
enclosures
,
it
would
be
worth
more
than
double
the
sum
.
    
<EOS>
"
Thus
encouraged
,
I
began
the
execution
of
my
scheme
without
further
delay
,
and
plunged
into
a
sea
of
expence
,
though
I
had
no
fund
in
reserve
,
and
the
whole
produce
of
the
estate
did
not
exceed
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
  
<EOS>
In
one
week
,
my
house
was
made
weather
tight
,
and
thoroughly
cleansed
from
top
to
bottom
;
then
it
was
well
ventilated
by
throwing
all
the
doors
and
windows
open
,
and
making
blazing
fires
of
wood
in
every
chimney
from
the
kitchen
to
the
garrets
  
<EOS>
The
floors
were
repaired
,
the
sashes
new
glazed
,
and
out
of
the
old
furniture
of
the
whole
house
,
I
made
a
shift
to
fit
up
a
parlour
and
three
chambers
in
a
plain
yet
decent
manner
.
  
<EOS>
The
court
yard
was
cleared
of
weeds
and
rubbish
,
and
my
friend
Wilson
charged
himself
with
the
dressing
of
the
garden
;
bricklayers
were
set
at
work
upon
the
barn
and
stable
;
and
labourers
engaged
to
restore
the
fences
,
and
begin
the
work
of
hedging
and
ditching
,
under
the
direction
of
farmer
Bland
,
at
whose
recommendation
I
hired
a
careful
hind
to
lie
in
the
house
,
and
keep
constant
fires
in
the
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
"
Having
taken
these
measures
,
I
returned
to
London
,
where
I
forthwith
sold
off
my
houshold
-
furniture
,
and
,
in
three
weeks
from
my
first
visit
,
brought
my
wife
hither
to
keep
her
Christmas
.
  
<EOS>
Considering
the
gloomy
season
of
the
year
,
the
dreariness
of
the
place
,
and
the
decayed
aspect
of
our
habitation
,
I
was
afraid
that
her
resolution
would
sink
under
the
sudden
translation
from
a
town
-
life
to
such
a
melancholy
state
of
rustication
;
but
I
was
agreeably
disappointed
  
<EOS>
She
found
the
reality
less
uncomfortable
than
the
picture
I
had
drawn
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
indeed
,
things
were
mended
in
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
The
out
-
houses
had
risen
out
of
their
ruins
;
the
pigeon
-
house
was
re
-
built
,
and
replenished
by
Wilson
,
who
also
put
my
garden
in
decent
order
,
and
provided
a
good
stock
of
poultry
,
which
made
an
agreeable
figure
in
my
yard
;
and
the
house
,
on
the
whole
,
looked
like
the
habitation
of
human
creatures
  
<EOS>
Farmer
Bland
spared
me
a
milch
-
cow
for
my
family
,
and
an
ordinary
saddle
-
horse
for
my
servant
to
go
to
market
at
the
next
town
.
  
<EOS>
I
hired
a
country
lad
for
a
footman
;
the
hind
's
daughter
was
my
house
-
maid
,
and
my
wife
had
brought
a
cook
-
maid
from
London
.
    
<EOS>
"
Such
was
my
family
when
I
began
housekeeping
in
this
place
,
with
three
hundred
pounds
in
my
pocket
,
raised
from
the
sale
of
my
superfluous
furniture
  
<EOS>
I
knew
we
should
find
occupation
enough
through
the
day
to
employ
our
time
;
but
I
dreaded
the
long
winter
evenings
;
yet
for
these
too
we
found
a
remedy
.
  
<EOS>
The
curate
who
was
a
single
man
,
soon
became
so
naturalized
to
the
family
,
that
he
generally
lay
in
the
house
;
and
his
company
was
equally
agreeable
and
useful
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
modest
man
,
a
good
scholar
,
and
perfectly
well
qualified
to
instruct
me
in
such
country
matters
as
I
wanted
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Wilson
brought
his
wife
to
see
us
,
and
she
became
so
fond
of
Mrs
Dennison
,
that
she
said
she
never
was
so
happy
as
when
she
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
her
conversation
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
then
a
fine
buxom
country
lass
,
exceedingly
docile
,
and
as
good
-
natured
as
her
husband
Jack
Wilson
;
so
that
a
friendship
ensued
among
the
women
,
which
hath
continued
to
this
day
.
    
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
Jack
,
he
hath
been
my
constant
companion
,
counseller
,
and
commissary
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
for
a
hundred
pounds
you
should
leave
my
house
without
seeing
him
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
is
an
universal
genius
 
<EOS>
his
talent
are
really
astonishing
  
<EOS>
He
is
an
excellent
carpenter
,
joiner
,
and
turner
,
and
a
cunning
artist
in
iron
and
brass
.
  
<EOS>
He
not
only
superintended
my
oeconomy
,
but
also
presided
over
my
pastimes
.
  
<EOS>
He
taught
me
to
brew
beer
,
to
make
cyder
,
perry
,
mead
,
usquebaugh
,
and
plague
-
water
;
to
cook
several
outlandish
delicacies
,
such
as
ollas
,
pepper
-
pots
,
pillaws
,
corys
,
chabobs
,
and
stufatas
.
  
<EOS>
He
understands
all
manner
of
games
from
chess
down
to
chuck
-
farthing
,
sings
a
good
song
,
plays
upon
the
violin
,
and
dances
a
hornpipe
with
surprising
agility
.
  
<EOS>
He
and
I
walked
,
and
rode
,
and
hunted
,
and
fished
together
,
without
minding
the
vicissitudes
of
the
weather
;
and
I
am
persuaded
that
in
a
raw
,
moist
climate
,
like
this
of
England
,
continual
exercise
is
as
necessary
as
food
to
the
preservation
of
the
individual
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
two
and
twenty
years
,
there
has
not
been
one
hour
's
interruption
or
abatement
in
the
friendship
subsisting
between
Wilson
's
family
and
mine
;
and
,
what
is
a
rare
instance
of
good
fortune
,
that
friendship
is
continued
to
our
children
.
  
<EOS>
His
son
and
mine
are
nearly
of
the
same
age
and
the
same
disposition
;
they
have
been
bred
up
together
at
the
same
school
and
college
,
and
love
each
other
with
the
warmest
affection
.
    
<EOS>
"
By
Wilson
's
means
,
I
likewise
formed
an
acquaintance
with
a
sensible
physician
,
who
lives
in
the
next
market
-
town
;
and
his
sister
,
an
agreeable
old
maiden
,
passed
the
Christmas
holydays
at
our
house
.
  
<EOS>
Mean
while
I
began
my
farming
with
great
eagerness
,
and
that
very
winter
planted
these
groves
that
please
you
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
nighbouring
gentry
,
I
had
no
trouble
from
that
quarter
during
my
first
campaign
;
they
were
all
gone
to
town
before
I
settled
in
the
country
;
and
by
the
summer
I
had
taken
measure
to
defend
myself
from
their
attacks
.
  
<EOS>
When
a
gay
equipage
came
to
my
gates
,
I
was
never
at
home
;
those
who
visited
me
in
a
modest
way
,
I
received
;
and
according
to
the
remarks
I
made
on
their
characters
and
conversation
,
either
rejected
their
advances
,
or
returned
their
civility
  
<EOS>
I
was
in
general
despised
among
the
fashionable
company
,
as
a
low
fellow
,
both
in
breeding
and
circumstances
;
nevertheless
,
I
found
a
few
individuals
of
moderate
fortune
,
who
gladly
adopted
my
stile
of
living
;
and
many
others
would
have
acceeded
to
our
society
,
had
they
not
been
prevented
by
the
pride
,
envy
,
and
ambition
of
their
wives
and
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
Those
,
in
times
of
luxury
and
dissipation
,
are
the
rocks
upon
which
all
the
small
estates
in
the
country
are
wrecked
.
    
<EOS>
"
I
reserved
in
my
own
hands
,
some
acres
of
ground
adjacent
to
the
house
,
for
making
experiments
in
agriculture
,
according
to
the
directions
of
Lyle
,
Tull
,
Hart
,
Duhamel
,
and
others
who
have
written
on
this
subject
;
and
qualified
their
theory
with
the
practical
observations
of
farmer
Bland
,
who
was
my
great
master
in
the
art
of
Husbandry
.
  
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
became
enamoured
of
a
country
life
;
and
my
success
greatly
exceeded
my
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
I
drained
bogs
,
burned
heath
,
grubbed
up
furze
and
fern
;
I
planted
copse
and
willows
where
nothing
else
would
grow
;
I
gradually
inclosed
all
my
farms
and
made
such
improvements
,
that
my
estate
now
yields
me
clear
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
my
wife
and
I
have
enjoyed
uninterrupted
health
,
and
regular
flow
of
spirits
,
except
on
a
very
few
occasions
,
when
our
chearfulness
was
invaded
by
such
accidents
as
are
inseparable
from
the
condition
of
life
.
  
<EOS>
I
lost
two
children
in
their
infancy
,
by
the
small
-
pox
,
so
that
I
have
one
son
only
,
in
whom
all
our
hopes
are
centered
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
yesterday
to
visit
a
friend
,
with
whom
he
has
stayed
all
night
,
but
he
will
be
here
to
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
I
shall
this
day
have
the
pleasure
of
presenting
him
to
you
and
your
family
;
and
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
you
will
find
him
not
altogether
unworthy
of
your
affection
.
    
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
either
I
am
blinded
by
the
partiality
of
a
parent
,
or
he
is
a
boy
of
a
very
amiable
character
;
and
yet
his
conduct
has
given
us
unspeakable
disquiet
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
we
had
projected
a
match
between
him
and
a
gentleman
's
daughter
in
the
next
county
,
who
will
in
all
probability
be
heiress
to
a
considerable
fortune
;
but
,
it
seems
,
he
had
a
personal
disgust
to
the
alliance
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
then
at
Cambridge
,
and
tried
to
gain
time
on
various
pretences
;
but
being
pressed
in
letters
by
his
mother
and
me
to
give
a
definitive
answer
,
he
fairly
gave
his
tutor
the
slip
,
and
disappeared
about
eight
months
ago
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
took
this
rash
step
,
he
wrote
me
a
letter
,
explaining
his
objections
to
the
match
,
and
declaring
,
that
he
would
keep
himself
concealed
until
he
would
understand
that
his
parents
would
dispense
with
his
contracting
an
engagement
that
must
make
him
miserable
for
life
,
and
he
prescribed
the
form
of
advertising
in
a
certain
news
-
paper
,
by
which
he
might
be
apprized
of
our
sentiments
on
this
subject
.
    
<EOS>
"
You
may
easily
conceive
how
much
we
were
alarmed
and
afflicted
by
this
elopement
,
which
he
had
made
without
droping
the
least
hint
to
his
companion
Charles
Wilson
,
who
belonged
to
the
same
college
.
  
<EOS>
We
resolved
to
punish
him
with
the
appearance
of
neglect
,
in
hopes
that
he
would
return
of
his
own
accord
;
but
he
maintained
his
purpose
till
the
young
lady
chose
a
partner
for
herself
;
then
he
produced
himself
,
and
made
his
peace
by
the
mediation
of
Wilson
.
  
<EOS>
Suppose
we
should
unite
our
families
by
joining
him
with
your
niece
,
who
is
one
of
the
most
lovely
creatures
I
ever
beheld
.
  
<EOS>
My
wife
is
already
as
fond
of
her
as
if
she
were
her
own
child
,
and
I
have
a
presentiment
that
my
son
will
be
captivated
by
her
at
first
sight
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
all
our
family
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
then
such
an
alliance
;
but
,
my
dear
friend
,
candour
obliges
me
to
tell
you
,
that
I
am
afraid
Liddy
's
heart
is
not
wholly
disengaged
  
<EOS>
there
is
a
cursed
obstacle
 
"
"
You
mean
the
young
stroler
at
Gloucester
(
said
he
)
  
<EOS>
You
are
surprised
that
I
should
know
this
circumstance
;
but
you
will
be
more
surprised
when
I
tell
you
that
stroller
is
no
other
than
my
son
George
Dennison
  
<EOS>
That
was
the
character
he
assumed
in
his
eclipse
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
am
,
indeed
,
astonished
and
overjoyed
,
(
cried
I
)
and
shall
be
happy
beyond
expression
to
see
your
proposal
take
effect
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
then
gave
me
to
understand
that
the
young
gentleman
,
at
his
emerging
from
concealment
,
had
disclosed
his
passion
for
Miss
Melford
,
the
niece
of
Mr
Bramble
of
Monmouthshire
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr
Dennison
little
dreamed
that
this
was
his
old
friend
Matthew
Loyd
,
he
nevertheless
furnished
his
son
with
proper
credentials
,
and
he
had
been
at
Bath
,
London
,
and
many
other
places
in
quest
of
us
,
to
make
himself
and
his
pretensions
known
  
<EOS>
The
bad
success
of
his
inquiry
had
such
an
effect
upon
his
spirits
,
that
immediately
at
his
return
he
was
seized
with
a
dangerous
fever
,
which
overwhelmed
his
parents
with
terror
and
affliction
;
but
he
was
now
happily
recovered
,
though
still
weak
and
disconsolate
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
joining
us
in
our
walk
,
I
informed
him
of
these
circumstances
,
with
which
he
was
wonderfully
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
declared
he
would
promote
the
match
to
the
utmost
of
his
power
,
and
that
he
longed
to
embrace
young
Mr
Dennison
as
his
friend
and
brother
.
  
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
father
went
to
desire
his
wife
to
communicate
this
discovery
gradually
to
Liddy
,
that
her
delicate
nerves
might
not
suffer
too
sudden
a
shock
;
and
I
imparted
the
particulars
to
my
sister
Tabby
,
who
expressed
some
surprize
,
not
altogether
unmixed
,
I
believe
,
with
an
emotion
of
envy
;
for
,
though
she
could
have
no
objection
to
an
alliance
at
once
so
honourable
and
advantageous
,
she
hesitated
in
giving
her
consent
,
on
pretence
of
the
youth
and
inexperience
of
the
parties
:
at
length
,
however
,
she
acquiesced
,
in
consequence
of
having
consulted
with
captain
Lismahago
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
took
care
to
be
in
the
way
when
his
son
arrived
at
the
gate
,
and
,
without
giving
him
time
or
opportunity
to
make
an
enquiry
about
the
strangers
,
brought
him
up
stairs
to
be
presented
to
Mr
Loyd
and
his
family
  
<EOS>
The
first
person
he
saw
,
when
he
entered
the
room
,
was
Liddy
,
who
,
notwithstanding
all
her
preparation
,
stood
trembling
in
the
utmost
confusion
  
<EOS>
At
sight
of
this
object
he
was
fixed
motionless
to
the
floor
,
and
,
gazing
at
her
with
the
utmost
eagerness
of
astonishment
,
exclaimed
,
"
Sacred
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
!
  
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
wherefore
 
.
<EOS>
"
Here
his
speech
failing
he
stood
straining
his
eyes
,
in
the
most
emphatic
silence
  
"
George
(
said
his
father
)
<EOS>
this
is
my
friend
Mr
Loyd
.
"
<EOS>
Roused
at
this
intimation
,
he
turned
and
received
my
salute
,
when
I
said
,
"
Young
gentleman
,
if
you
had
trusted
me
with
your
secret
at
our
last
meeting
,
we
should
have
parted
upon
better
terms
.
<EOS>
"
Before
he
could
make
any
answer
,
Jery
came
round
and
stood
before
him
with
open
arms
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
started
and
changed
colour
;
but
after
a
short
pause
,
he
rushed
into
his
embrace
,
and
they
hugged
one
another
as
if
they
had
been
intimate
friends
from
their
infancy
:
then
he
payed
his
respects
to
Mrs
Tabitha
,
and
advancing
to
Liddy
,
"
Is
it
possible
,
(
cried
he
)
that
my
senses
do
not
play
me
false
!
  
<EOS>
That
I
see
Miss
Melford
under
my
father
's
roof
 
that
I
am
permitted
to
speak
to
her
without
giving
offence
 
and
that
her
relations
have
honoured
me
with
their
countenance
and
protection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Liddy
blushed
,
and
trembled
,
and
faultered
  
"
To
be
sure
,
sir
,
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
it
is
a
very
surprising
circumstance
 
a
great
 
a
providential
  
<EOS>
I
really
know
not
what
I
say
  
<EOS>
but
I
beg
<EOS>
you
will
think
I
have
said
what
's
agreeable
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Dennison
interposing
said
,
"
Compose
yourselves
,
my
dear
children
.
  
<EOS>
Your
mutual
happiness
shall
be
our
peculiar
care
.
<EOS>
"
The
son
going
up
to
his
mother
,
kissed
one
hand
;
my
niece
bathed
the
other
with
her
tears
;
and
the
good
old
lady
pressed
them
both
in
their
turns
to
her
breast
  
<EOS>
The
lovers
were
too
much
affected
to
get
rid
of
their
embarrassment
for
one
day
;
but
the
scene
was
much
enlivened
by
the
arrival
of
Jack
Wilson
,
who
brought
,
as
usual
,
some
game
of
his
own
killing
  
His
honest
countenance
was
a
good
letter
of
recommendation
.
  
<EOS>
I
received
him
like
a
dear
friend
after
a
long
separation
;
and
I
could
not
help
wondering
to
see
him
shake
Jery
by
the
hand
as
an
old
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
,
indeed
,
been
acquainted
some
days
,
in
consequence
of
a
diverting
incident
,
which
I
shall
explain
at
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
That
same
night
a
consultation
was
held
upon
the
concerns
of
the
lovers
,
when
the
match
was
formally
agreed
to
,
and
all
the
marriage
-
articles
were
settled
without
the
least
dispute
.
  
<EOS>
My
nephew
and
I
promised
to
make
Liddy
's
fortune
five
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
declared
,
he
would
make
over
one
half
of
his
estate
immediately
to
his
son
,
and
that
his
daughter
-
in
-
law
should
be
secured
in
a
jointure
of
four
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
Tabby
proposed
,
that
,
considering
their
youth
,
they
should
undergo
one
year
at
least
of
probation
before
the
indissoluble
knot
should
be
tied
;
but
the
young
gentleman
being
very
impatient
and
importunate
,
and
the
scheme
implying
that
the
young
couple
should
live
in
the
house
,
under
the
wings
of
his
parents
,
we
resolved
to
make
them
happy
without
further
delay
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
law
requires
that
the
parties
should
be
some
weeks
resident
in
the
parish
,
we
shall
stay
here
till
the
ceremony
is
performed
  
<EOS>
Mr
Lismahago
requests
that
he
may
take
the
benefit
of
the
same
occasion
;
so
that
next
Sunday
the
banns
will
be
published
for
all
four
together
.
  
<EOS>
I
doubt
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
pass
my
Christmas
with
you
at
Brambleton
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
so
agreeably
situated
in
this
place
,
that
I
have
no
desire
to
shift
my
quarters
;
and
I
foresee
,
that
when
the
day
of
separation
comes
,
there
will
be
abundance
of
sorrow
on
all
sides
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
we
must
make
the
most
of
those
blessings
which
Heaven
bestows
.
  
<EOS>
Considering
how
you
are
tethered
by
your
profession
,
I
can
not
hope
to
see
you
so
far
from
home
;
yet
the
distance
does
not
exceed
a
summer's
-
day
's
journey
,
and
Charles
Dennison
,
who
desires
to
be
remembered
to
you
,
would
be
rejoiced
to
see
his
old
compotator
;
but
as
I
am
now
stationary
,
I
expected
regular
answers
to
the
epistles
of
    
Yours
invariably
,
Matt

<EOS>
DEAR
WAT
,
EVERY
day
is
now
big
with
incidents
and
discovery
  
<EOS>
Young
Mr
Dennison
proves
to
be
no
other
than
that
identical
person
whom
I
have
execrated
so
long
under
the
name
of
Wilson
  
<EOS>
He
had
eloped
from
college
at
Cambridge
,
to
avoid
a
match
that
he
detested
,
and
acted
in
different
parts
of
the
country
as
a
stroller
,
untill
the
lady
in
question
made
choice
of
a
husband
for
herself
<EOS>
then
he
returned
to
his
father
,
and
disclosed
his
passion
for
Liddy
,
which
met
with
the
approbation
of
his
parents
,
though
the
father
little
imagined
that
Mr
Bramble
was
his
old
companion
Matthew
Loyd
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
being
empowered
to
make
honourable
proposals
to
my
uncle
and
me
,
had
been
in
search
of
us
all
over
England
,
without
effect
;
and
he
<EOS>
it
was
whom
I
had
seen
pass
on
horseback
by
the
window
of
the
inn
,
where
I
stood
with
my
sister
,
but
he
little
dreamed
that
we
were
in
the
house
  
<EOS>
As
for
the
real
Mr
Wilson
,
whom
I
called
forth
to
combat
,
by
mistake
,
he
is
the
neighbour
and
intimate
friend
of
old
Mr
Dennison
,
and
this
connection
had
suggested
to
the
son
the
idea
of
taking
that
name
while
he
remained
in
obscurity
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
easily
conceive
what
pleasure
<EOS>
I
must
have
felt
on
discovering
that
the
honour
of
your
family
was
in
no
danger
from
the
conduct
of
a
sister
,
whom
I
love
with
uncommon
affection
;
that
,
instead
of
debasing
her
sentiments
and
views
to
a
wretched
stroller
,
she
had
really
captivated
the
heart
of
a
gentleman
,
her
equal
in
rank
and
superior
in
fortune
;
and
that
,
as
his
parents
approved
of
his
attachment
,
I
was
on
the
eve
of
acquiring
a
brother
-
in
-
law
so
worthy
of
my
friendship
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
George
Dennison
is
,
without
all
question
,
one
of
the
most
accomplished
young
fellows
in
England
.
<EOS>
His
person
is
at
once
elegant
and
manly
,
and
his
understanding
highly
cultivated
.
<EOS>
Though
his
spirit
is
lofty
,
his
heart
is
kind
;
and
his
manner
so
engaging
,
as
to
command
veneration
and
love
,
even
from
malice
and
indifference
.
<EOS>
When
I
weigh
my
own
character
with
his
,
I
am
ashamed
to
find
myself
so
light
in
the
balance
;
but
the
comparison
excites
no
envy
  
<EOS>
I
propose
him
as
a
model
for
imitation
  
I
have
endeavoured
to
recommend
myself
to
his
friendship
,
and
hope
I
have
already
found
a
place
in
his
affection
.
<EOS>
I
am
,
however
,
mortified
to
reflect
what
flagrant
injustice
we
every
day
commit
,
and
what
absurd
judgment
we
form
,
in
viewing
objects
through
the
falsifying
medium
of
prejudice
and
passion
,
Had
you
asked
me
a
few
days
ago
,
the
picture
of
Wilson
the
player
,
I
should
have
drawn
a
portrait
very
unlike
the
real
person
and
character
of
George
Dennison
  
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
the
greatest
advantage
acquired
in
travelling
and
perusing
mankind
in
the
original
,
is
that
of
dispelling
those
shameful
clouds
that
darken
the
faculties
of
the
mind
,
preventing
it
from
judging
with
candour
and
precision
.
    
<EOS>
The
real
Wilson
is
a
great
original
,
and
the
best
tempered
,
companionable
man
I
ever
knew
  
<EOS>
I
question
if
ever
he
was
angry
or
low
spirited
in
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
makes
no
pretensions
to
letters
;
but
he
is
an
adept
in
every
thing
else
that
can
be
either
useful
or
entertaining
.
<EOS>
Among
other
qualifications
,
he
is
a
complete
sportsman
,
and
counted
the
best
shot
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
He
and
Dennison
,
and
Lismahago
and
I
,
attended
by
Clinker
,
went
a
shooting
yesterday
,
and
made
great
havock
among
-
the
partridges
  
To
-
morrow
<EOS>
we
shall
take
the
field
against
the
woodcocks
and
snipes
,
<EOS>
In
the
evening
we
dance
and
sing
,
or
play
at
commerce
,
loo
and
quadrille
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
is
an
elegant
poet
,
and
has
written
some
detached
pieces
on
the
subject
of
his
passion
for
Liddy
,
which
must
be
very
flattering
to
the
vanity
of
a
young
woman
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
is
one
of
the
greatest
theatrical
geniuses
that
ever
appeared
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
entertains
us
with
reciting
favourite
speeches
from
our
best
plays
.
<EOS>
We
are
resolved
to
convert
the
great
hall
into
a
theatre
,
and
get
up
the
Beaux
Stratagem
without
delay
  
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
make
no
contemptible
figure
in
the
character
of
Scrub
;
and
Lismahago
will
be
very
great
in
Captain
Gibbet
  
<EOS>
Wilson
undertakes
to
entertain
the
country
people
with
Harlequin
Skeleton
,
for
which
he
has
got
a
jacket
ready
painted
with
his
own
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Our
society
is
really
enchanting
.
<EOS>
Even
the
severity
of
Lismahago
relaxes
,
and
the
vinegar
of
Mrs
Tabby
is
remarkably
dulcified
,
ever
since
it
was
agreed
that
she
should
take
precedency
of
her
niece
in
being
first
noosed
:
for
,
you
must
know
,
the
day
is
fixed
for
Liddy
's
marriage
;
and
the
banns
for
both
couples
have
been
already
once
published
in
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
The
captain
earnestly
begged
that
one
trouble
might
serve
for
all
,
and
Tabitha
assented
with
a
vile
affectation
of
reluctance
.
<EOS>
Her
inamorata
,
who
came
hither
very
slenderly
equipt
,
has
sent
for
his
baggage
to
London
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
will
not
arrive
in
time
for
the
wedding
;
but
it
is
of
no
great
consequence
,
as
every
thing
is
to
be
transacted
with
the
utmost
privacy
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
directions
are
given
for
making
out
the
contracts
of
marriage
;
which
are
very
favourable
for
both
females
;
Liddy
will
be
secured
in
a
good
jointure
;
and
her
aunt
will
remain
mistress
of
her
own
fortune
,
except
one
half
of
the
interest
,
which
her
husband
shall
have
a
right
to
enjoy
for
his
natural
life
:
I
think
this
is
as
little
in
conscience
as
can
be
done
for
a
man
who
yokes
with
such
a
partner
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
These
expectants
seem
to
be
so
happy
,
that
if
Mr
Dennison
had
an
agreeable
daughter
,
I
believe
,
I
should
be
for
making
the
third
couple
in
this
country
dance
.
<EOS>
The
humour
seems
to
be
infectious
;
for
Clinker
,
alias
Loyd
,
has
a
month
's
mind
to
play
the
fool
,
in
the
same
fashion
,
with
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
.
<EOS>
He
has
even
sounded
me
on
the
subject
;
but
I
have
given
him
no
encouragement
to
prosecute
this
scheme
  
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
thought
he
might
do
better
,
as
there
was
no
engagement
nor
promise
subsisting
;
that
I
did
not
know
what
designs
my
uncle
might
have
formed
for
his
advantage
;
but
I
was
of
opinion
,
that
he
should
not
,
at
present
,
run
the
risque
of
disobliging
him
by
any
premature
application
of
this
nature
  
Honest
Humphry
protested
,
he
would
suffer
death
sooner
than
do
or
say
any
thing
that
should
give
offence
to
the
"
squire
<EOS>
but
he
owned
he
had
a
kindness
for
the
young
woman
and
had
reason
to
think
she
looked
upon
him
with
a
favourable
eye
;
that
he
considered
this
mutual
manifestation
of
good
will
,
as
an
engagement
understood
,
which
ought
to
be
binding
to
the
conscience
of
an
honest
man
;
and
he
hoped
the
"
squire
<EOS>
and
I
would
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
when
we
should
be
at
leisure
to
bestow
any
thought
about
the
matter
  
<EOS>
I
believe
he
is
in
the
right
;
and
we
shall
find
time
to
take
his
case
into
consideration
  
<EOS>
You
see
we
are
fixed
for
some
weeks
at
least
,
and
as
you
have
had
a
long
respite
,
I
hope
you
will
begin
immediately
to
discharge
the
arrears
due
to
    
<EOS>

affectionate

<EOS>
MY
DEAR
,
DEAR
LETTY
,
NEVER
did
I
sit
down
to
write
in
such
agitation
as
I
now
feel
  
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
few
days
,
we
have
met
with
a
number
of
incidents
so
wonderful
and
interesting
,
that
all
my
ideas
are
thrown
into
confusion
and
perplexity
  
<EOS>
You
must
not
expect
either
method
or
coherence
in
what
I
am
going
to
relate
 
my
dearest
Willis
.
<EOS>
Since
my
last
,
the
aspect
of
affairs
is
totally
changed
!
 
<EOS>
and
so
changed
!
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
would
fain
give
you
a
regular
detal
  
<EOS>
In
passing
a
river
,
about
eight
days
ago
,
our
coach
was
overturned
,
and
some
of
us
narrowly
escaped
with
life
  
<EOS>
My
uncle
had
well
nigh
perished
  
<EOS>
O
Heaven
,
I
can
not
reflect
upon
that
circumstance
without
horror
  
<EOS>
I
should
have
lost
my
best
friend
,
my
father
and
protector
,
but
for
the
resolution
and
activity
of
his
servant
Humphry
Clinker
,
whom
Providence
really
seems
to
have
placed
near
him
for
the
necessity
of
this
occasion
.
  
<EOS>
I
would
not
be
thought
superstitious
;
but
surely
he
acted
from
a
stronger
impulse
than
common
fidelity
  
<EOS>
Was
it
not
the
voice
of
nature
that
loudly
called
upon
him
to
save
the
life
of
his
own
father
?
<EOS>
for
,
O
Letty
,
it
was
discovered
that
Humphry
Clinker
was
my
uncle
's
natural
son
.
    
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
instant
,
a
gentleman
,
who
came
to
offer
us
his
assistance
,
and
invite
us
to
his
house
,
turned
out
to
be
a
very
old
friend
of
Mr
Bramble
  
<EOS>
His
name
is
Mr
Dennison
,
one
of
the
worthiest
men
living
;
and
his
lady
is
a
perfect
saint
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
They
have
an
only
son
 
who
do
you
think
is
this
only
son
?
  
<EOS>
O
Lety
!
 
<EOS>
O
gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
how
my
heart
palpitates
,
when
I
tell
you
that
this
only
son
of
Mr
Dennison
,
is
that
very
identical
youth
who
,
under
the
name
of
Wilson
,
has
made
such
ravage
in
my
heart
!
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
friend
!
<EOS>
Wilson
and
I
are
now
lodged
in
the
same
house
,
and
converse
together
freely
  
His
father
approves
of
his
sentiments
in
my
favour
;
his
father
loves
me
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
parent
,
my
uncle
,
my
aunt
,
and
my
brother
,
no
longer
oppose
my
inclinations
  
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
they
have
agreed
to
make
us
happy
without
delay
;
and
in
three
weeks
or
a
month
,
if
no
unforeseen
accident
intervenes
,
your
friend
Lydia
Melford
,
will
have
changed
her
name
and
condition
  
<EOS>
I
say
,
if
no
accident
intervenes
,
because
such
a
torrent
of
success
makes
me
tremble
!
  
<EOS>
I
wish
there
may
not
be
something
treacherous
in
this
sudden
reconciliation
of
fortune
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
merit
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
title
to
such
felicity
?
<EOS>
Far
from
enjoying
the
prospect
that
lies
before
me
,
my
mind
is
harassed
with
a
continued
tumult
,
made
up
of
hopes
and
wishes
,
doubts
and
apprehensions
  
<EOS>
I
can
neither
eat
nor
sleep
,
and
my
spirits
are
in
perpetual
flutter
.
  
<EOS>
I
more
than
ever
feel
that
vacancy
in
my
heart
,
which
your
presence
alone
can
fill
.
  
<EOS>
The
mind
,
in
every
disquit
,
seeks
to
repose
itself
on
the
bosom
of
a
friend
;
and
this
is
such
trial
as
I
really
know
not
how
to
support
without
your
company
and
counsel
  
<EOS>
I
must
therefore
,
dear
Letty
,
put
your
friendship
to
the
test
  
<EOS>
I
must
beg
you
will
come
and
do
the
last
offices
of
maidenhood
to
your
companion
Lydia
Melford
.
    
<EOS>
This
letter
goes
enclosed
in
one
to
our
worthy
governess
,
from
Mrs
Dennison
,
entreating
her
to
interpose
,
with
your
mamma
,
that
you
may
be
allowed
to
favour
us
with
your
company
on
this
occasion
;
and
I
flatter
myself
that
no
material
objection
can
be
made
to
our
request
  
<EOS>
The
distance
from
hence
to
Gloucester
,
does
not
exceed
one
hundred
miles
,
and
the
roads
are
good
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Clinker
,
alias
Loyd
,
shall
be
sent
over
to
attend
your
motions
 
if
you
step
into
the
post

chaise
,
with
your
maid
Betty
Barker

at
seven
in
the

,
you
will
arrive
by

in
the
afternoon
at
the

where
there
is
good
accommodation

<EOS>
There
you
shall
be
met
by
my
brother
and
myself
,
who
will
next
day
conduct
you
to
this
place
,
where
,
I
am
sure
,
you
will
find
yourself
perfectly
at
your
ease
in
the
midst
of
an
agreeable
society
.
  
<EOS>
Dear
Letty
,
I
will
take
no
refusal
 
if
you
have
any
friendship
 
<EOS>
any
humanity
 
<EOS>
you
will
come
.
  
<EOS>
I
desire
that
immediate
application
may
be
made
to
your
mamma
;
and
that
the
moment
her
permission
is
obtained
,
you
will
apprise
    
Your
ever
faithful

DEAR
MADAM
,
Though
I
was
not
so
fortunate
as
to
be
favoured
with
an
answer
to
the
letter
with
which
I
troubled
you
in
the
spring
,
I
still
flatter
myself
that
you
retain
some
regard
for
me
and
my
concerns
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
the
care
and
tenderness
with
which
I
was
treated
,
under
your
roof
and
tuition
,
demand
the
warmest
returns
of
gratitude
and
affection
on
my
part
,
and
these
sentiments
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
I
shall
cherish
to
my
dying
day
  
<EOS>
At
present
,
I
think
it
my
duty
to
make
you
acquainted
with
the
happy
issue
of
that
indiscretion
by
which
I
incurred
your
displeasure
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
madam
,
the
slighted
Wilson
is
metamorphosed
into
George
Dennison
,
only
son
and
heir
of
a
gentleman
,
whose
character
is
second
to
none
in
England
,
as
you
may
understand
upon
inquiry
.
<EOS>
My
guardians
,
my
brother
and
I
,
are
now
in
his
house
;
and
an
immediate
union
of
the
two
families
is
to
take
place
in
the
persons
of
the
young
gentlemen
and
your
poor
Lydia
Melford
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
easily
conceive
how
imbarrassing
this
situation
must
be
to
a
young
inexperienced
creature
like
me
,
of
weak
nerves
and
strong
apprehensions
;
and
how
much
the
presence
of
a
friend
and
confidante
would
encourage
and
support
me
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
that
of
all
the
young
ladies
,
Miss
Willis
was
she
that
possessed
the
greatest
share
of
my
confidence
and
affection
;
and
,
therefore
,
I
fervently
wish
to
have
the
happiness
of
her
company
at
this
interesting
crisis
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Dennison
,
who
is
the
object
of
universal
love
and
esteem
,
has
,
at
my
request
,
written
to
you
on
this
subject
,
and
I
now
beg
leave
to
reinforce
her
solicitation
.
  
<EOS>
My
dear
Mrs
Jermyn
!
<EOS>
my
ever
honoured
governess
!
<EOS>
let
me
conjure
you
by
that
fondness
which
once
distinguished
your
favourate
Liddy
!
<EOS>
by
that
benevolence
of
heart
which
disposes
you
to
promote
the
happiness
of
your
fellow
-
creatures
in
general
!
<EOS>
lend
a
favourable
ear
to
my
petition
,
and
use
your
influence
with
Letty
's
mamma
,
that
my
most
earnest
desire
may
be
gratified
.
<EOS>
Should
I
be
indulged
in
this
particular
,
I
will
engage
to
return
her
safe
,
and
even
to
accompany
her
to
Gloucester
,
where
,
if
you
will
give
me
leave
,
I
will
present
to
you
,
under
another
name
,
    
<EOS>
Dear
madam

I
have
met
with
so
many
axidents
,
surprisals
,
and
terrifications
,
that
I
am
in
a

believe
I
shall
never

my
own

again

<EOS>
Last
week
I
was
dragged
out
of
a
river
like
a
drowned
rat
,
and
lost
a
bran
-
new
night
-
cap
,
with
a
sulfur
stay
-
hook
,
that
cost
me
a
good
half
-
a

crown
,
and
an
odd
shoe
of
green
gallow
monkey
;
besides
wetting
my
cloaths
and
taring
my
smuck
,
and
an
ugly
gash
made
in
the
back
part
of
my
thy
,
by
the
stump
of
a
tree
 
to
be
sure
Mr
Clinker
tuck
me
out
of
the
cox
;
but
he
left
me
on
my
back
in
the
water
,
to
go
to
the
"
squire
;
and
I
mought
have
had
a
watry
grave
,
if
a
millar
had
not
brought
me
to
the
dry
land
  
<EOS>
But
,
O

<EOS>
what
choppings

The

<EOS>
We
are
all
together
in

all
parties
have
agreed
to
the
match
,
and
in
a

the
surrymony
will
be
performed

But
this

not

wedding

<EOS>
Mistriss

have

in

<EOS>
Last
Sunday
in

crutch
,
if
my

be
trusted
,
the
clark
called
the

betwixt

and
Tapitha
Brample
,
spinster
;
he
mought
as

have
called
her
inkle

weaver
,
for
she
never
spun
an
hank
of
yarn
in
her
life
 
<EOS>
young
"
squire
Dollison
and
miss
Liddy
made
the
second
kipple
;
and
there
might
have
been
a
turd
,
but
times
are
changed
with
Mr
Clinker
  
<EOS>
O
Molly
!
<EOS>
what
do'st
think
?
<EOS>
Mr
Clinker
is
found
to
be
a
pye
-
blow
of
our
own
"
squire
,
and
his
rite
naam
is
Mr
Mattew
Loyd
(
thof
God
<EOS>
he
nose
how
that
can
be
)
;
and
he
is
not
out
of
livery
,
and
wares
ruffles
  
<EOS>
but
I
knew
him
when
he
was
out
at
elbows
,
and
had
not
a
rag
to
kiver
his
pistereroes
;
so
he
need
not
hold
his
head
so
high
  
<EOS>
He
is
for
certain
very
umble
and
compleasant
,
and
purtests
as
how
he
has
the
same
regard
as
before
;
but
that
he
is
no
longer
his
own
master
,
and
can
not
portend
to
marry
without
the
"
squire
's
consent
  
<EOS>
He
says
we
must
wait
with
patience
,
and
trust
to
Providence
,
and
such
nonsense
  
<EOS>
But
if
so
be
as
how
his
regard
be
the
same
,
why
stand
shilly*shally
?
<EOS>
Why
not
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
,
and
speak
to
the
"
squire
without
loss
of
time
?
  
<EOS>
What
subjection
can
the
"
squire
make
to
our
coming
together
?
  
<EOS>
Thof
my
father
wan't
a
gentleman
<EOS>
,
my

was

I
did
n't
come
on

My

Mr

(

had
best
look

his
tacle
  
<EOS>
There
be
other
chaps
in
the
market
,
as
the
saying
is
  
What
would
he
say
if
I
should
except
the
foot
and
sarvice
of
the
young
"
squire
's
valley
?
<EOS>
Mr
Machappy
is
a
gentleman
born
,
and
has
been
a
broad
in
the
wars
  
<EOS>
He
has
a
world
of
buck
larning
,
and
speak
French
,
and
Ditch
,
and
Scotch
,
and
all
manner
of
outlandish
lingoes
;
to
be
sure
he
's
a
little
the
worse
for
the
ware
,
and
is
much
given
to
drink
;
but
then
he
's
good
-
tempered
in
his
liquor
,
and
a
prudent
woman
mought
wind
him
about
her
finger
  
<EOS>
But
I
have
no
thoughts
of
him
<EOS>
,
I
'll
assure
you
  
I
scorn
for
to
do
,
or
to
say

or
to
think
any
thing
that
mought
give
unbreech
to
Mr
Loyd
,
without
furder
occasion
  
<EOS>
But
then
I
have
such
vapours
,
Molly
 
I
sit
and
cry
by
myself
,
and
take
ass
of
etida
,
and
smill
to
burnt
fathers

and
kindal

snuffs
;
and
I
pray
constantly
for
grease
,
that
I
may
have
a
glimpse
of
the
new

light
,
to
shew
me
the
way
through
this
wretched
veil
of
tares
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
I
want
for
nothing
in
this
family
of
love
,
where
every
sole

so
kind

so
courteous
that
wan

To

<EOS>
DEAR
DICK
,
YOU
can
not
imagine
what
pleasure
I
have
in
seeing
your
hand
writing
,
after
such
a
long
cessation
on
your
side
of
our
correspondence
  
<EOS>
Yet
Heaven
knows
,
<EOS>
I
have
often
seen
your
hand
 
writing
with
disgust
  
<EOS>
I
mean
,
when
it
appeared
in
abbreviations
of
apothecary
's
Latin
  
<EOS>
I
like
your
hint
of
making
interest
for
the
reversica
of
the
collector
's
place
,
for
Mr
Lismahago
,
who
is
much
pleased
with
the
scheme
,
and
presents
you
with
his
compliments
and
best
thanks
for
thinking
<EOS>
so
kind
of
his
concerns
  
<EOS>
The
man
seems
to
mend
,
upon
further
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
That
harsh
reserve
,
which
formed
a
disagreeable
huik
about
his
character
,
begins
to
peel
off
in
the
course
of
our
communication
  
<EOS>
I
have
great
hopes
that
he
and
Tabby
will
be
as
happily
paired
as
any
two
draught
animals
in
the
kingdom
;
and
I
make
no
doubt
,
but
that
he
will
prove
a
valuable
acquisition
to
our
little
society
,
in
the
article
of
conversation
,
by
the
fire
-
side
in
winter
    
<EOS>
Your
objection
to
my
passing
this
season
of
the
year
at
such
a
distance
from
home
would
have
more
weight
if
I
did
not
find
myself
perfectly
at
my
ease
where
I
am
,
and
my
health
so
much
improved
,
that
I
am
disposed
to
bid
defiance
to
gout
and
rheumatism
  
<EOS>
I
begin
to
think
I
have
put
my
self
on
the
superannuated
list
too
soon
,
and
absurdly
sought
for
health
in
the
retreats
of
laziness
  
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
that
all
valetudinarians
are
too
sedentary
,
too
regular
,
and
too
cautious
 
<EOS>
we
should
sometimes
increase
the
motion
of
the
machine
,
to
unclog
the
wheels
of
life
;
and
now
and
then
take
a
plunge
amidst
the
waves
of
excess
,
in
order
to
case
-
harden
the
constitution
.
<EOS>
I
have
even
found
a
change
of
company
as
necessary
as
a
change
of
air
,
to
promote
a
vigorous
circulation
of
the
spirits
,
which
is
the
very
essence
and
critertion
of
good
health
.
    
<EOS>
Since
my
last
,
I
have
been
performing
the
duties
of
friendship
,
that
required
a
great
deal
of
exercise
,
from
which
I
hope
to
derive
some
benefit
  
Understanding
,
by
the
greatest
accident
in
the
world
,
that
Mr
Baynard
's
wife
was
dangerously
ill
of
a
pleuritic
fever
,
I
borrowed
Dennison
's
postchaise
,
and
went
a
-
cross
the
country
to
his
habitation
,
attended
only
by
Loyd
(
quondam
Clinker
)
on
horseback
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
distance
is
not
above
thirty
miles
,
I
arrived
about
four
in
the
afternoon
,
and
meeting
the
physician
at
the
door
,
was
informed
that
his
patient
had
just
expired
  
<EOS>
I
was
instantly
.
<EOS>
seized
with
a
violent
emotion
,
but
it
was
not
grief
  
<EOS>
The
family
being
in
confusion
,
I
ran
up
stairs
into
the
chamber
,
where
,
indeed
,
they
were
all
assembled
  
The
aunt
stood
wringing
her
hands
in
a
kind
of
stupefaction
of
sorrow
,
but
my
friend
acted
all
the
extravagancies
of
affliction
  
<EOS>
He
held
the
body
in
his
arms
,
and
poured
forth
such
a
lamentation
,
that
one
would
have
thought
he
had
lost
the
most
amiable
consort
and
valuable
companion
upon
earth
.
    
<EOS>
Affection
may
certainly
exist
independant
of
esteem
;
nay
,
the
same
object
may
be
lovely
in
one
respect
,
and
detestable
in
another
  
The
mind
has
a
surprising
faculty
of
accommodating
,
and
even
attaching
itself
,
in
such
a
manner
,
by
dint
of
use
to
things
that
are
in
their
own
nature
disagreeable
and
even
pernicious
,
that
it
can
not
bear
to
be
delivered
from
them
without
reluctance
and
regret
.
<EOS>
Baynard
was
so
absorbed
in
his
delirium
,
that
he
did
not
perceive
me
when
I
entered
,
and
desired
one
of
the
women
to
conduct
the
aunt
into
her
own
chamber
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
begged
the
tutor
to
withdraw
the
boy
,
who
stood
gaping
in
a
corner
,
very
little
affected
with
the
distress
of
the
scene
  
These
steps
being
taken
.
<EOS>
I
waited
till
the
first
violence
of
my
friend
's
transport
was
abated
,
then
disengaged
him
gently
from
the
melancholy
object
,
and
led
him
by
the
hand
into
another
apartment
;
though
he
struggled
so
hard
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
his
valet
de
chambre
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
he
recollected
himself
,
and
folding
me
in
his
arms
,
"
This
(
cried
he
)
is
a
friendly
office
,
indeed
!
  
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
you
came
hither
;
but
,
I
think
,
Heaven
sent
you
to
prevent
my
going
distracted
  
O
Matthew
!
<EOS>
I
have
lost
my
dear
Harriet
!
 
<EOS>
my
poor
,
gentle
,
tender
creature
,
that
loved
me
with
such
warmth
and
purity
of
affection
  
my
constant
companion
of
twenty
years
!
  
<EOS>
She
's
gone
 
<EOS>
she
's
gone
for
ever
!
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
where
is
she
?
  
<EOS>
Death
shall
not
part
us
!
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
started
up
,
and
could
hardly
be
with
-
held
from
returning
to
the
scene
we
had
quitted
  
<EOS>
You
will
perceive
it
would
have
been
very
absurd
for
me
to
argue
with
a
man
that
talked
so
madly
.
  
<EOS>
On
all
such
occasions
,
the
first
torrent
of
passion
must
be
allowed
to
subside
gradually
.
  
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
beguile
his
attention
by
starting
little
hints
and
insinuating
other
objects
of
discourse
imperceptably
;
and
being
exceedingly
pleased
in
my
own
mind
at
this
event
,
I
exerted
myself
with
such
an
extraordinary
flow
of
spirits
as
was
attended
with
success
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
hours
,
he
was
calm
enough
to
hear
reason
,
and
even
own
that
Heaven
could
not
have
interposed
more
effectually
to
rescue
him
from
disgrace
and
ruin
  
That
he
might
not
,
however
,
relapse
into
weaknesses
for
want
of
company
,
I
passed
the
night
in
his
chamber
,
in
a
little
tent
bed
brought
thither
on
purpose
;
and
well
it
was
<EOS>
I
took
this
precaution
,
for
he
started
up
in
bed
several
times
,
and
would
have
played
the
fool
,
if
I
had
not
been
present
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
he
was
in
a
condition
to
talk
of
business
,
and
vested
me
with
full
authority
over
his
household
,
which
I
began
to
exercise
without
loss
of
time
,
tho
'
not
before
he
knew
and
approved
of
the
scheme
I
had
projected
for
his
advantage
.
  
<EOS>
He
would
have
quitted
the
house
immediately
;
but
this
retreat
I
opposed
.
  
<EOS>
Far
from
encouraging
a
temporary
disgust
,
which
might
degenerate
into
an
habitual
aversion
,
I
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
attach
him
more
than
ever
to
his
Household
Gods
  
<EOS>
I
gave
directions
for
the
funeral
to
be
as
private
as
was
consistent
with
decency
;
I
wrote
to
London
,
that
an
inventory
and
estimate
might
be
made
of
the
furniture
and
effects
in
his
town
-
house
,
and
gave
notice
to
the
landlord
,
that
Mr
Baynard
should
quit
the
premises
at
Lady
-
day
;
I
set
a
person
at
work
to
take
account
of
every
thing
in
the
country
-
house
,
including
horses
,
carriages
,
and
harness
;
I
settled
the
young
gentleman
at
a
boarding
-
school
,
kept
by
a
clergyman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
thither
<EOS>
he
went
without
reluctance
,
as
soon
as
he
knew
that
he
was
to
be
troubled
no
more
with
his
tutor
,
whom
we
dismissed
.
  
<EOS>
The
aunt
continued
very
sullen
,
and
never
appeared
at
table
,
though
Mr
Baynard
payed
his
respects
to
her
every
day
in
her
own
chamber
;
there
also
she
held
conferences
with
the
waiting
-
woman
and
other
servants
of
the
family
:
but
,
the
moment
her
niece
was
interred
,
she
went
away
in
a
post
-
chase
prepared
for
that
purpose
:
<EOS>
she
did
not
leave
the
house
,
however
,
without
giving
Mr
Baynard
to
understand
,
that
the
wardrobe
of
her
niece
was
the
perquisite
of
her
woman
;
accordingly
that
worthless
drab
received
all
the
clothes
,
laces
,
and
linen
of
her
deceased
mistress
,
to
the
value
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
at
a
moderate
computation
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
step
I
took
was
to
disband
that
legion
of
supernumerary
domestics
,
who
had
preyed
so
long
upon
the
vitals
of
my
friend
:
a
parcel
of
idle
drones
,
so
intolerably
insolent
,
that
they
even
treated
their
own
master
with
the
most
contemptuous
neglect
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
generally
hired
by
his
wife
,
according
to
the
recommendation
of
her
woman
,
and
these
were
the
only
patrons
to
whom
they
payed
the
least
deference
.
<EOS>
I
had
therefore
uncommon
satisfaction
in
clearing
the
house
of
those
vermin
.
<EOS>
The
woman
of
the
deceased
,
and
a
chambermaid
,
a
valet
de
chambre
,
a
butler
,
a
French
cook
,
a
master
gardener
,
two
footmen
,
and
a
coachman
,
I
payed
off
,
and
turned
out
of
the
house
immediately
,
paying
to
each
a
month
's
wages
in
lieu
of
warning
.
<EOS>
Those
whom
I
retained
,
consisted
of
a
female
cook
,
who
had
been
assistant
to
the
Frenchman
,
a
house
-
maid
,
an
old
lacquey
,
a
postilion
,
and
under
-
gardener
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
removed
at
once
a
huge
mountain
of
expence
and
care
from
the
shoulders
of
my
friend
,
who
could
hardly
believe
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
,
when
he
found
himself
so
suddenly
and
effectually
relieved
.
<EOS>
His
heart
,
however
,
was
still
subject
to
vibrations
of
tenderness
,
which
returned
at
certain
intervals
,
extorting
sighs
,
and
tears
,
and
exclamations
of
grief
and
impatience
but
these
sits
grew
every
day
less
violent
and
less
frequent
,
till
at
length
his
reason
obtained
a
complete
victory
over
the
infirmities
of
his
nature
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
an
accurate
inquiry
into
the
state
of
his
affairs
,
I
find
his
debts
amount
to
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
for
eighteen
thousand
pounds
of
which
sum
his
estate
is
mortgaged
;
and
as
he
pays
five
percent
.
<EOS>
interest
,
and
some
of
his
farms
are
unoccupied
,
he
does
not
receive
above
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
clear
from
his
lands
,
over
and
above
the
interest
of
his
wife
's
fortune
,
which
produce
eight
hundred
pounds
annually
.
<EOS>
For
lightening
this
heavy
burden
,
I
devised
the
following
expedient
.
  
<EOS>
His
wife
's
jewels
,
together
with
his
superfluous
plate
and
furniture
in
both
houses
,
his
horses
and
carriages
,
which
are
already
advertised
to
be
sold
by
auction
,
will
,
according
to
the
estimate
,
produce
two
thousand
five
hundred
pounds
in
ready
money
,
with
which
the
debt
will
be
immediately
reduced
to
eighteen
thousand
pounds
  
I
have
undertaken
to
find
him
ten
thousand
pounds
at
four
per
cent
.
<EOS>
by
which
means
he
will
save
one
hundred
a
-
year
in
the
article
of
interest
,
and
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
borrow
the
other
eight
thousand
on
the
same
terms
.
<EOS>
According
to
his
own
scheme
of
a
country
life
,
he
says
he
can
live
comfortably
for
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
;
but
,
as
he
has
a
son
to
educate
,
he
will
allow
him
five
hundred
;
then
there
will
be
an
accumulating
fund
of
seven
hundred
a
-
year
,
principal
and
interest
,
to
pay
off
the
incumbrance
;
and
,
I
think
,
we
may
modestly
add
three
hundred
,
on
the
presumption
of
new
-
leasing
and
improving
the
vacant
farms
:
so
that
,
in
a
couple
of
years
,
I
suppose
there
will
be
above
a
thousand
a
-
year
appropriated
to
liquidate
a
debt
of
sixteen
thousand
.
    
<EOS>
We
forthwith
began
to
class
and
set
apart
the
articles
designed
for
sale
,
under
the
direction
of
an
upholder
from
London
;
and
,
that
nobody
in
the
house
might
be
idle
,
commenced
our
reformation
without
doors
,
as
well
as
within
.
<EOS>
With
Baynard
's
good
leave
,
I
ordered
the
gardener
to
turn
the
rivulet
into
its
old
channel
to
refresh
the
fainting
Naiads
,
who
had
so
long
languished
among
mouldring
roots
,
withered
leaves
,
and
dry
pebbles
.
  
<EOS>
The
shrubbery
is
condemned
to
extirpation
;
and
the
pleasure
ground
will
be
restored
to
its
original
use
of
corn
-
field
and
pasture
.
  
<EOS>
Orders
are
given
for
rebuilding
the
walls
of
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
for
planting
clumps
of
firs
,
intermingled
with
beech
and
chestnut
,
at
the
east
end
,
which
is
now
quite
exposed
to
the
surly
blasts
that
come
from
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
All
these
works
being
actually
begun
,
and
the
house
and
auction
left
to
the
care
and
management
of
a
reputable
attorney
,
I
brought
Baynard
along
with
me
in
the
chaise
,
and
made
him
acquainted
with
Dennison
,
whose
goodness
of
heart
would
not
fail
to
engage
his
esteem
and
affection
.
  
<EOS>
He
is
indeed
charmed
with
our
society
in
general
,
and
declares
that
he
never
saw
the
theory
of
true
pleasure
reduced
to
practice
before
.
  
<EOS>
I
really
believe
it
would
not
be
an
easy
task
to
find
such
a
number
of
individuals
assembled
under
one
roof
,
more
happy
than
we
are
at
present
.
    
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
,
however
,
in
confidence
,
I
suspect
Tabby
of
tergiversation
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
been
so
long
accustomed
to
that
original
,
that
I
know
all
the
caprices
of
her
heart
,
and
can
often
perceive
her
designs
while
they
are
yet
in
embrio
  
<EOS>
She
attached
herself
to
Lismahago
for
no
other
reason
but
that
she
despaired
of
making
a
more
agreeable
conquest
.
  
<EOS>
At
present
,
if
I
am
not
much
mistaken
in
my
observation
,
she
would
gladly
convert
the
widowhood
of
Baynard
to
her
own
advantage
  
Since
he
arrived
,
she
has
behaved
very
coldly
to
the
captain
,
and
strove
to
fasten
on
the
other
's
heart
,
with
the
hooks
of
overstrained
civility
.
  
<EOS>
These
must
be
the
instinctive
efforts
of
her
constitution
,
rather
than
the
effects
of
any
deliberate
design
;
for
matters
are
carried
to
such
a
length
with
the
lieutenant
,
that
she
could
not
retract
with
any
regard
to
conscience
or
reputation
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
will
meet
with
nothing
but
indifference
or
aversion
on
the
side
of
Baynard
,
who
has
too
much
sense
to
think
of
such
a
partner
at
any
time
,
and
too
much
delicacy
to
admit
a
thought
of
any
such
connexion
at
the
present
juncture
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
I
have
prevailed
upon
her
to
let
him
have
four
thousand
pounds
at
four
per
cent
.
<EOS>
towards
paying
of
his
mortgage
.
<EOS>
Young
Dennison
has
agreed
that
Liddy
's
fortune
shall
be
appropriated
to
the
same
purpose
,
on
the
same
terms
.
  
<EOS>
His
father
will
fell
out
three
thousand
pounds
stock
for
his
accommodation
.
  
<EOS>
Farmer
Bland
has
,
at
the
desire
of
Wilson
,
undertaken
for
two
thousand
;
and
I
must
make
an
effort
to
advance
what
further
will
be
required
to
take
my
friend
out
of
the
hands
of
the
Philistines
.
<EOS>
He
is
so
pleased
with
the
improvements
made
on
his
estate
,
which
is
all
cultivated
like
a
garden
,
that
he
has
entered
himself
as
a
pupil
in
farming
to
Mr
Dennison
,
and
resolved
to
attach
himself
wholly
to
the
practice
of
husbandry
.
    
<EOS>
Every
thing
is
now
prepared
for
our
double
wedding
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
-
articles
for
both
couples
are
drawn
and
executed
;
and
the
ceremony
only
waits
until
the
parties
shall
have
been
resident
in
the
parish
the
term
prescribed
by
law
.
<EOS>
Young
Dennison
betrays
some
symptoms
of
impatience
;
but
,
Lismahago
bears
this
necessary
delay
with
the
temper
of
a
philosopher
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
the
captain
does
not
stand
altogether
on
the
foundation
of
personal
merit
.
<EOS>
Besides
his
half
-
pay
,
amounting
to
two
and
forty
pounds
a
year
,
this
indefatigable
oeconomist
has
amassed
eight
hundred
pounds
which
he
has
secured
in
the
funds
.
<EOS>
This
sum
arises
partly
from
his
pay
's
running
up
while
he
remained
among
the
indians
;
partly
from
what
he
received
as
a
consideration
for
the
difference
between
his
full
appointment
and
the
half
-
pay
,
to
which
he
is
now
restricted
;
and
partly
from
the
profits
of
a
little
traffic
he
drove
in
peltry
,
during
his
fachemship
among
the
Miamis
.
    
<EOS>
Liddy
's
fears
and
perplexities
have
been
much
assuaged
by
the
company
of
one
Miss
Willis
,
who
had
been
her
intimate
companion
at
the
boarding
-
school
.
<EOS>
Her
parents
had
been
earnestly
solicited
to
allow
her
making
this
friendly
visit
on
such
an
extraordinary
occasion
;
and
two
days
ago
she
arrived
with
her
mother
,
who
did
not
choose
that
she
should
come
without
a
proper
governante
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
is
very
sprightly
,
handsome
,
and
agreeable
,
and
the
mother
<EOS>
a
mighty
good
sort
of
a
woman
;
so
that
their
coming
adds
considerably
to
our
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
But
we
shall
have
a
third
couple
yoked
in
the
matrimonial
chain
.
<EOS>
Mr
Clinker
Loyd
has
made
humble
remonstrance
,
through
the
canal
of
my
nephew
,
setting
forth
the
sincere
love
and
affection
mutually
subsisting
between
him
and
Mrs
Winifred
Jenkins
,
and
praying
my
consent
to
their
coming
together
for
life
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
wished
that
Mr
Clinker
had
kept
out
of
this
scrape
;
but
as
the
nymph
's
happiness
is
at
stake
,
and
she
has
had
already
some
fits
in
the
way
of
despondence
,
I
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
tragical
catastrophe
,
has
given
him
leave
to
play
the
fool
,
in
imitation
of
his
betters
;
and
I
suppose
we
shall
in
time
have
a
whole
litter
of
his
progeny
at
Brambleton
-
hall
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
is
stout
and
lusty
,
very
sober
and
conscientious
;
and
the
wench
seems
to
be
as
great
an
enthusiast
in
love
as
in
religion
.
    
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
think
of
employing
him
some
other
way
,
that
the
parish
may
not
be
overstocked
  
<EOS>
you
know
he
has
been
bred
a
farrier
,
consequently
belongs
to
the
faculty
;
and
as
he
is
very
docile
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
,
with
your
good
instruction
,
he
may
be
,
in
a
little
time
,
qualified
to
act
as
a
Welch
apothecary
.
<EOS>
Tabby
who
never
did
a
favour
with
a
good
grace
,
has
consented
,
with
great
reluctance
,
to
this
match
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
hurts
her
pride
,
as
she
now
considers
Clinker
,
in
the
light
of
a
relation
;
but
,
I
believe
,
her
objections
are
of
a
more
selfish
nature
.
<EOS>
She
declares
she
can
not
think
of
retaining
the
wife
of
Mathew
Loyd
in
the
character
of
a
servant
;
and
she
foresees
,
that
on
such
an
occasion
the
woman
will
expect
some
gratification
for
her
past
services
.
<EOS>
As
for
Clinker
,
exclusive
of
other
considerations
,
he
is
so
trusty
,
brave
,
affectionate
,
and
alert
,
and
I
owe
him
such
personal
obligations
,
that
he
merits
more
than
all
the
indulgence
that
can
possibly
be
shewn
him
,
by
    
yours
,
Matt

,
    
DEAR
KNIGHT
,
THE
fatal
knot
are
now
tied
.
<EOS>
The
comedy
is
near
a
close
;
and
the
curtain
is
ready
to
drop
:
but
,
the
latter
scenes
of
this
act
I
shall
recapitulate
in
order
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
ago
,
my
uncle
made
an
excursion
a
cross
the
country
,
and
brought
hither
a
particular
friend
,
one
Mr
Baynard
,
who
has
just
lost
his
wife
,
and
was
for
some
time
disconsolate
,
though
by
all
accounts
he
had
much
more
cause
for
joy
than
for
sorrow
at
this
event
.
  
<EOS>
His
countenance
,
however
,
clears
up
apace
;
and
he
appears
to
be
a
person
of
rare
accomplishments
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
have
received
another
still
more
agreeable
reinforcement
to
our
company
,
by
the
arrival
of
Miss
Willis
from
Gloucester
.
<EOS>
She
was
Liddy
's
bosom
friend
at
the
boarding
-
school
,
and
being
earnestly
solicited
to
assist
at
the
nuptials
,
her
mother
was
so
obliging
as
to
grant
my
sister
's
request
,
and
even
to
come
with
her
in
person
.
<EOS>
Liddy
,
accompanied
by
George
Dennison
and
me
,
gave
them
the
meeting
half
-
way
,
and
next
day
conducted
them
hither
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Miss
Willis
is
a
charming
girl
,
and
,
in
point
of
disposition
,
an
agreeable
contrast
to
my
sister
,
who
is
rather
too
grave
and
sentimental
for
my
turn
of
mind
  
<EOS>
The
other
is
gay
,
frank
,
a
little
giddy
,
and
always
good
-
humoured
.
<EOS>
She
has
,
moreover
,
a
genteel
fortune
,
is
well
born
,
and
remarkably
handsome
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
Phillips
!
<EOS>
if
these
qualities
were
permanent
if
her
humour
would
never
change
,
nor
her
beauties
decay
,
what
efforts
would
I
not
make
  
But
these
are
idle
reflections
  
<EOS>
my
destiny
must
one
day
be
fulfilled
.
    
<EOS>
At
present
we
pass
the
time
as
agreeably
as
we
can
  
We
have
got
up
several
farces
which
afforded
unspeakable
entertainment
by
the
effects
they
produced
among
the
country
people
,
who
are
admitted
to
all
our
exhibitions
  
<EOS>
Two
nights
ago
Jack
Wilson
acquired
great
applause
in
Harlequin
Skeleton
,
and
Lismahago
surprized
us
all
in
the
character
of
Pierot
.
  
<EOS>
His
long
lank
sides
,
and
strong
marked
features
,
were
all
peculiarly
adapted
to
his
part
.
  
<EOS>
He
appeared
with
a
ludicrous
stare
,
from
which
he
had
discharged
all
meaning
:
he
adopted
the
impressions
of
fear
and
amazement
so
naturally
,
that
many
of
the
audience
were
infected
by
his
looks
;
but
when
the
skeleton
held
him
in
chase
,
his
horror
became
most
divertingly
picturesque
,
and
seemed
to
endow
him
with
such
praeternatural
agility
as
confounded
all
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lively
representation
of
Death
in
pursuit
of
Consumption
,
and
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
commonalty
,
that
some
of
them
shrieked
aloud
,
and
others
ran
out
of
the
hall
in
the
utmost
consternation
.
    
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
only
instance
in
which
the
lieutenant
has
already
excited
our
wonder
.
<EOS>
His
temper
which
had
been
soured
and
shrivelled
by
disappointment
and
chagrin
,
is
now
swelled
out
,
and
smoothed
like
a
raisin
in
plum
-
porridge
.
<EOS>
From
being
reserved
and
punctilious
,
he
is
become
easy
and
obliging
.
<EOS>
He
cracks
jokes
,
laughs
and
banters
with
the
most
facetious
familiarity
;
and
,
in
a
word
,
enters
into
all
our
schemes
of
merriment
and
pastime
  
<EOS>
The
other
day
his
baggage
arrived
in
the
waggon
from
London
,
contained
in
two
large
trunks
and
a
long
deal
box
not
unlike
a
coffin
.
<EOS>
The
trunks
were
filled
with
his
wardrobe
,
which
he
displayed
for
the
entertainment
of
the
company
,
and
he
freely
owned
,
that
it
consisted
chiefly
of
the
opima
spolia
taken
in
battle
.
<EOS>
What
he
selected
for
his
wedding
suit
,
was
a
tarnished
white
cloth
faced
with
blue
velvet
,
embroidered
with
silver
;
but
,
he
valued
himself
most
upon
a
tye
-
periwig
,
in
which
he
had
made
his
first
appearance
as
a
lawyer
above
thirty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
This
machine
had
been
in
buckle
ever
since
,
and
now
all
the
servants
in
the
family
were
employed
to
frizz
it
out
for
the
occasion
,
which
was
yesterday
celebrated
at
the
parish
church
.
<EOS>
George
Dennison
and
his
bride
were
distinguished
by
nothing
extraordinary
in
their
apparel
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
lightened
with
eagerness
and
joy
,
and
she
trembled
with
coyness
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
gave
her
away
,
and
her
friend
Willis
supported
her
during
the
ceremony
.
    
<EOS>
But
my
aunt
and
her
paramour
took
the
pas
,
and
formed
,
indeed
,
such
a
pair
of
originals
,
as
,
I
believe
,
all
England
could
not
parallel
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
in
the
stile
of
1739
;
and
the
day
being
cold
,
put
on
a
manteel
of
green
velvet
laced
with
gold
;
but
this
was
taken
off
by
the
bridegroom
,
who
threw
over
her
shoulders
a
fur
cloak
of
American
fables
,
valued
at
four
score
guineas
,
a
present
equally
agreeable
and
unexpected
.
<EOS>
Thus
accoutred
,
she
was
led
up
to
the
altar
by
Mr
Dennison
,
who
did
the
office
of
her
father
:
<EOS>
Lismahago
advanced
in
the
military
step
with
his
French
coat
reaching
no
farther
than
the
middle
of
his
thigh
,
his
campaign
wig
that
surpasses
all
description
,
and
a
languishing
leer
upon
his
countenance
,
in
which
there
seemed
to
be
something
arch
and
ironical
.
<EOS>
The
ring
,
which
he
put
upon
her
finger
,
he
had
concealed
till
the
moment
it
was
used
.
<EOS>
He
now
produced
it
with
an
air
of
self
-
complacency
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
curious
antique
,
set
with
rose
diamonds
;
he
told
us
afterwards
,
it
had
been
in
his
family
two
hundred
years
,
and
was
a
present
from
his
grandmother
.
<EOS>
These
circumstances
agreeably
flattered
the
pride
of
our
aunt
Tabitha
,
which
had
already
found
uncommon
gratification
in
the
captain
's
generosity
;
for
he
had
,
in
the
morning
,
presented
my
uncle
with
a
fine
bear
's
skin
,
and
a
Spanish
fowling
-
piece
,
and
me
with
a
case
of
pistols
curiously
mounted
with
silver
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
gave
Mrs
Jenkins
an
Indian
purse
,
made
of
silk
grass
,
containing
twenty
crown
pieces
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
this
young
lady
,
with
the
assistance
of
Mr
Loyd
,
formed
the
third
couple
who
yesterday
sacrificed
to
Hymen
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
you
in
my
last
,
that
he
had
recourse
to
my
mediation
,
which
I
employed
successfully
with
my
uncle
;
but
Mrs
Tabitha
held
out
till
the
love
-
sick
Jenkins
had
two
fits
of
the
mother
;
then
she
relented
,
and
those
two
cooing
turtles
were
caged
for
life
  
<EOS>
Our
aunt
made
an
effort
of
generosity
in
furnishing
the
bride
with
her
superfluties
of
clothes
and
linen
,
and
her
example
was
followed
by
my
sister
;
nor
did
Mr
Bramble
<EOS>
and
I
neglect
her
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
day
of
peace
offering
  
<EOS>
Mr
Dennison
insisted
upon
Liddy
's
accepting
two
bank
notes
of
one
hundred
pounds
each
,
as
pocket
-
money
;
and
his
lady
gave
her
a
diamond
necklace
of
double
that
value
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
besides
,
a
mutual
exchange
of
tokens
among
the
individuals
of
the
two
families
thus
happily
united
    
<EOS>
As
George
Dennison
and
his
partner
were
judged
improper
objects
of
mirth
,
Jack
Wilson
had
resolved
to
execute
some
jokes
on
Lismahago
,
and
after
supper
began
to
ply
him
with
bumpers
,
when
the
ladies
had
retired
;
but
the
captain
perceiving
his
drift
,
begged
for
quarter
,
alledging
that
the
adventure
,
in
which
he
had
engaged
,
was
a
very
serious
matter
;
and
that
it
would
be
more
the
part
of
a
good
Christian
to
pray
that
he
might
be
strengthened
,
than
to
impede
his
endeavours
to
finish
the
adventure
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
spared
accordingly
,
and
permitted
to
ascend
the
nuptial
couch
with
all
his
senses
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
he
and
his
consort
sat
in
state
,
like
Saturn
and
Cybele
,
while
the
benediction
-
posset
was
drank
;
and
a
cake
being
broken
over
the
head
of
Mrs
Tabitha
Lismahago
,
the
fragments
were
distributed
among
the
bystanders
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
antient
Britons
,
on
the
supposition
that
every
person
who
ate
of
this
hallowed
cake
,
should
that
night
have
a
vision
of
the
man
or
woman
whom
Heaven
designed
<EOS>
should
be
his
or
her
wedded
mate
.
    
<EOS>
The
weight
of
Wilson
's
waggery
fell
upon
honest
Humphry
and
his
spouse
,
who
were
bedded
in
an
upper
room
,
with
the
usual
ceremony
of
throwing
the
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
This
being
performed
,
and
the
company
withdrawn
,
a
sort
of
catterwauling
ensued
,
when
Jack
found
means
to
introduce
a
real
cat
shod
with
walnut
-
shells
,
which
galloping
along
the
boards
,
made
such
a
dreadful
noise
as
effectually
discomposed
our
lovers
.
  
<EOS>
Winifried
screamed
aloud
,
and
shrunk
under
the
bed
-
cloaths
.
  
<EOS>
Mr
Loyd
,
believing
that
Satan
was
come
to
buffet
him
in
propria
persona
,
laid
aside
all
carnal
thoughts
,
and
began
to
pray
aloud
with
great
fervency
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
poor
animal
,
being
more
afraid
than
either
,
leaped
into
the
bed
,
and
meauled
with
the
most
piteous
exclamation
.
  
<EOS>
Loyd
,
thus
informed
of
the
nature
of
the
annoyance
,
rose
and
set
the
door
wide
open
,
so
that
this
troublesome
visitan
retreated
with
great
expedition
;
then
securing
himself
,
by
means
of
a
double
bolt
,
from
a
second
intrusion
,
he
was
left
to
enjoy
his
good
fortune
without
further
disturbance
.
    
<EOS>
If
one
may
judge
from
the
looks
of
the
parties
,
they
are
all
very
well
satisfied
with
what
has
passed
,
  
george
Dennison
and
his
wife
are
too
delicate
to
exhibit
any
strong
-
marked
signs
of
their
mutual
satisfaction
,
but
their
eyes
are
sufficiently
expressive
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs
Tabitha
Lismahago
is
rather
fulsome
in
signifying
her
approbation
of
the
captain
's
love
;
while
his
deportment
is
the
very
pink
of
gallantry
,
  
He
sighs
,
and
ogles
,
and
languishes
at
this
amiable
object
;
kisses
her
hand
,
mutters
ejaculations
of
rapture
,
and
sings
tender
airs
;
and
,
no
doubt
,
laughs
internally
at
her
folly
in
believing
him
sincere
.
  
<EOS>
In
order
to
shew
how
little
his
vigour
was
impaired
by
the
fatigues
of
the
proceeding
day
,
he
this
morning
danced
a
Highland
saraband
over
a
naked
back
-
sword
,
and
leaped
so
high
,
that
I
believe
he
would
make
no
contemptible
figure
as
a
vaulter
at
Sadler
's
Wells
  
<EOS>
Mr
Matthew
Loyd
,
when
asked
how
he
relishes
his
bargain
,
throws
up
his
eyes
,
crying
,
"
For
what
we
have
received
,
Lord
make
us
thankful
:
amen
.
"
  
<EOS>
His
helpmate
giggles
,
and
holds
her
hand
before
her
eyes
,
affecting
to
be
ashamed
of
having
been
in
bed
with
a
man
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
all
these
widgeons
enjoy
the
novelty
of
their
situation
;
but
,
perhaps
their
note
will
be
changed
,
when
they
are
better
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
the
decoy
.
    
<EOS>
As
Mrs
Willis
can
not
be
persuaded
to
stay
,
and
Liddy
is
engaged
by
promise
to
accompany
her
daughter
back
to
Gloucester
,
I
fancy
there
will
be
a
general
migration
from
hence
,
and
that
most
of
us
will
spend
the
Christmas
holidays
at
Bath
;
in
which
case
,
I
shall
certainly
find
an
opportunity
to
beat
up
your
quarters
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
I
suppose
,
you
are
sick
of
alma
mater
,
and
even
ready
to
execute
that
scheme
of
peregrination
,
which
was
last
year
concerted
between
you
and
    
your
affectionate
J
Melford

DEAR
DOCTOR
,
   
MY
niece
Liddy
is
now
happily
settled
for
life
;
and
captain
Lismahago
has
taken
Tabby
off
my
hands
;
so
that
I
have
nothing
further
to
do
,
but
to
comfort
my
friend
Baynard
,
and
provide
for
my
son
Loyd
,
who
is
also
fairly
joined
to
Mrs
<EOS>
Winifred
Jenkins
  
<EOS>
You
are
an
excellent
genious
at
hints
.

Dr
Arbuthnot

but
a
type
of
Dr
Lewis
in
that
respect
.
  
<EOS>
What
you
observe
of
the
vestry
-
clerk
deserves
consideration
.
  
<EOS>
I
make
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
Matthew
Loyd
is
well
enough
qualified
for
the
office
;
but
,
at
present
,
you
must
find
room
for
him
in
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
His
incorruptible
honesty
and
indefatigable
care
will
be
serviceable
in
superintending
the
oeconomy
of
my
farm
;
tho
'
I
do
n't
mean
that
he
will
interfere
with
Bayns
,
of
whom
I
have
no
cause
to
complain
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
just
returned
with
Baynard
,
from
a
second
trip
to
his
house
,
where
every
thing
is
regulated
to
his
satisfaction
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
review
the
apartments
without
tears
and
lamentation
,
so
that
he
is
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
be
left
alone
;
therefore
I
will
not
part
with
him
till
the
spring
,
when
he
intends
to
plunge
into
the
avocation
of
husbandry
,
which
will
at
once
employ
and
amuse
his
attention
.
  
<EOS>
Charles
Dennison
has
promised
to
stay
with
him
a
fortnight
,
to
set
him
fairly
afloat
in
his
improvements
;
and
Jack
Wilson
will
see
him
from
time
to
time
;
besides
he
has
a
few
friends
in
the
country
,
whom
his
new
plan
of
life
will
not
exclude
from
his
society
.
  
<EOS>
In
less
than
a
year
I
make
no
doubt
but
he
will
find
himself
perfectly
at
ease
both
in
his
mind
and
body
,
for
the
one
had
dangerously
affected
the
other
;
and
I
shall
enjoy
the
exquisite
pleasure
of
seeing
my
friend
rescued
from
misery
and
contempt

Mrs
:
Willis
being
determined
to
return
with
her
daughter
,
in
a
few
days
,
to
Gloucester
,
our
plan
has
undergone
some
alteration
.
  
<EOS>
Jery
has
persuaded
his
brother
-
in
-
law
to
carry
his
wife
to
Bath
;
and
I
believe
his
parents
will
accompany
him
thither
.
  
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
have
no
intention
to
take
that
route
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
something
very
extraordinary
that
will
induce
me
to
revisit
either
Bath
or
London
.
<EOS>
My
sister
and
her
husband
,
Baynard
and
I
,
will
take
leave
of
them
at
Gloucester
,
and
make
the
best
of
our
way
to
Brambleton
-
hall
,
where
I
desire
you
will
prepare
a
good
chine
and
turkey
for
our
Christmas
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
You
must
also
employ
your
medical
skill
in
defending
me
from
the
attacks
of
the
gout
,
that
I
may
be
in
good
case
to
receive
the
rest
of
our
company
,
who
promise
to
visit
us
in
their
return
from
the
Bath
.
<EOS>
As
I
have
laid
in
a
considerable
stock
of
health
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
you
will
not
have
much
trouble
with
me
in
the
way
of
physic
,
but
I
intend
to
work
you
on
the
side
of
exercise
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
got
an
excellent
fowling
-
piece
from
Mr
Lismahago
,
who
is
a
keen
sportsman
,
and
we
shall
take
the
heath
in
all
weathers
.
<EOS>
That
this
scheme
of
life
may
be
prosecuted
the
more
effectually
,
I
intend
to
renounce
all
sedentary
amusements
,
particularly
that
of
writing
long
letters
;
a
resolution
,
which
,
had
I
taken
it
sooner
,
might
have
saved
you
the
trouble
which
you
have
lately
taken
in
reading
the
tedious
epistles
of
    
Matt

GOOD

MRS

HEAVEN

for

purposes
<EOS>
hath
ordained
that
I
should
change
my

in

,
so
that
I
am
not
to
be
considered
any
more
as
manger
of
my

<EOS>
but
as
I
can
not
surrender
up
my
stewardship
till
I
have
settled

Williams

I
desire
you
will
get

Mrs

to
a

can
not
remain

therefore
,
I
wish
you
would
cast
about
for
some
creditable
body
to
be
with
me
in
her
room
  
<EOS>
If
she
can
spin
,
and
is
mistress
of
plain
-
work
,
so
much
the
better
 
<EOS>
but
she
must
not
expect
extravagant
wages
  
having
a
family
of
my
own
,
I
must
be
more
occumenical
than
ever
