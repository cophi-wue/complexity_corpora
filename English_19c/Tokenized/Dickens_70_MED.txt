The
Dawn
 
An
ancient
English
Cathedral
Tower
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
the
ancient
English
Cathedral
tower
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
The
well
-
known
massive
gray
square
tower
of
its
old
Cathedral
?
 
<EOS>
How
can
that
be
here
!
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
spike
of
rusty
iron
in
the
air
,
between
the
eye
and
it
,
from
any
point
of
the
real
prospect
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
spike
that
intervenes
,
and
who
has
set
it
up
?
 
<EOS>
Maybe
it
is
set
up
by
the
Sultan
's
orders
for
the
impaling
of
a
horde
of
Turkish
robbers
,
one
by
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
,
for
cymbals
clash
,
and
the
Sultan
goes
by
to
his
palace
in
long
procession
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
scimitars
flash
in
the
sunlight
,
and
thrice
ten
thousand
dancing
-
girls
strew
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
follow
white
elephants
caparisoned
in
countless
gorgeous
colours
,
and
infinite
in
number
and
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
Cathedral
Tower
rises
in
the
background
,
where
it
can
not
be
,
and
still
no
writhing
figure
is
on
the
grim
spike
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
!
 
<EOS>
Is
the
spike
so
low
a
thing
as
the
rusty
spike
on
the
top
of
a
post
of
an
old
bedstead
that
has
tumbled
all
awry
?
 
<EOS>
Some
vague
period
of
drowsy
laughter
must
be
devoted
to
the
consideration
of
this
possibility
.
   
<EOS>
Shaking
from
head
to
foot
,
the
man
whose
scattered
consciousness
has
thus
fantastically
pieced
itself
together
,
at
length
rises
,
supports
his
trembling
frame
upon
his
arms
,
and
looks
around
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
in
the
meanest
and
closest
of
small
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
ragged
window
-
curtain
,
the
light
of
early
day
steals
in
from
a
miserable
court
.
 
<EOS>
He
lies
,
dressed
,
across
a
large
unseemly
bed
,
upon
a
bedstead
that
has
indeed
given
way
under
the
weight
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Lying
,
also
dressed
and
also
across
the
bed
,
not
longwise
,
are
a
Chinaman
,
a
Lascar
,
and
a
haggard
woman
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
first
are
in
a
sleep
or
stupor
;
the
last
is
blowing
at
a
kind
of
pipe
,
to
kindle
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
she
blows
,
and
shading
it
with
her
lean
hand
,
concentrates
its
red
spark
of
light
,
it
serves
in
the
dim
morning
as
a
lamp
to
show
him
what
he
sees
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Another
?
"
says
this
woman
,
in
a
querulous
,
rattling
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
Have
another
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
looks
about
him
,
with
his
hand
to
his
forehead
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ye've
smoked
as
many
as
five
since
ye
come
in
at
midnight
,
"
the
woman
goes
on
,
as
she
chronically
complains
.
 
<EOS>
"
Poor
me
,
poor
me
,
my
head
is
so
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Them
two
come
in
after
ye
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
<EOS>
poor
me
<EOS>
,
the
business
is
slack
,
is
slack
!
 
<EOS>
Few
Chinamen
about
the
Docks
,
and
fewer
Lascars
,
and
no
ships
coming
in
,
these
say
!
 
<EOS>
Here
's
another
ready
for
ye
,
deary
.
 
<EOS>
Ye'll
remember
like
a
good
soul
,
wo
n't
ye
,
that
the
market
price
is
dreffle
high
just
now
?
 
<EOS>
More
nor
three
shillings
and
sixpence
for
a
thimbleful
!
 
<EOS>
And
ye'll
remember
that
nobody
but
me
(
and
Jack
Chinaman
t'other
side
the
court
;
but
he
ca
n't
do
it
as
well
as
me
)
<EOS>
has
the
true
secret
of
mixing
it
?
 
<EOS>
Ye'll
pay
up
accordingly
,
deary
,
wo
n't
ye
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
blows
at
the
pipe
as
she
speaks
,
and
,
occasionally
bubbling
at
it
,
inhales
much
of
its
contents
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
me
,
O
me
,
my
lungs
is
weak
,
my
lungs
is
bad
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
nearly
ready
for
ye
,
deary
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
<EOS>
poor
me
,
poor
me
<EOS>
,
my
poor
hand
shakes
like
to
drop
off
!
 
<EOS>
I
see
ye
coming
-
to
,
and
I
ses
to
my
poor
self
,
<EOS>
"
I
'll
have
another
ready
for
him
,
and
he
'll
bear
in
mind
the
market
price
of
opium
,
and
pay
according
.
"
 
<EOS>
O
my
poor
head
!
 
<EOS>
I
makes
my
pipes
of
old
penny
ink
-
bottles
,
ye
see
,
deary
---
this
is
one
---
and
<EOS>
I
fits
-
in
a
mouthpiece
,
this
way
,
and
I
takes
my
mixter
out
of
this
thimble
with
this
little
horn
spoon
;
and
so
I
fills
,
deary
.
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
poor
nerves
!
 
<EOS>
I
got
Heavens
-
hard
drunk
for
sixteen
year
afore
<EOS>
I
took
to
this
;
but
this
do
n't
hurt
me
,
not
to
speak
of
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
takes
away
the
hunger
as
well
as
wittles
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
hands
him
the
nearly
-
emptied
pipe
,
and
sinks
back
,
turning
over
on
her
face
.
   
<EOS>
He
rises
unsteadily
from
the
bed
,
lays
the
pipe
upon
the
hearth
-
stone
,
draws
back
the
ragged
curtain
,
and
looks
with
repugnance
at
his
three
companions
.
 
<EOS>
He
notices
that
the
woman
has
opium
-
smoked
herself
into
a
strange
likeness
of
the
Chinaman
.
 
<EOS>
His
form
of
cheek
,
eye
,
and
temple
,
and
his
colour
,
are
repeated
in
her
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Chinaman
convulsively
wrestles
with
one
of
his
many
Gods
or
Devils
,
perhaps
,
and
snarls
horribly
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lascar
laughs
and
dribbles
at
the
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
The
hostess
is
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
visions
can
SHE
have
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
the
waking
man
muses
,
as
he
turns
her
face
towards
him
,
and
stands
looking
down
at
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Visions
of
many
butchers
'
shops
,
and
public
-
houses
,
and
much
credit
?
 
<EOS>
Of
an
increase
of
hideous
customers
,
and
this
horrible
bedstead
set
upright
again
,
and
this
horrible
court
swept
clean
?
 
<EOS>
What
can
she
rise
to
,
under
any
quantity
of
opium
,
higher
than
that
!
<EOS>
---
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
bends
down
his
ear
,
to
listen
to
her
mutterings
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unintelligible
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
watches
the
spasmodic
shoots
and
darts
that
break
out
of
her
face
and
limbs
,
like
fitful
lightning
out
of
a
dark
sky
,
some
contagion
in
them
seizes
upon
him
:
 
insomuch
that
he
has
to
withdraw
himself
to
a
lean
arm
-
chair
by
the
hearth
---
placed
there
,
perhaps
,
for
such
emergencies
---
and
to
sit
in
it
,
holding
tight
,
until
he
has
got
the
better
of
this
unclean
spirit
of
imitation
.
   
<EOS>
Then
he
comes
back
,
pounces
on
the
Chinaman
,
and
seizing
him
with
both
hands
by
the
throat
,
turns
him
violently
on
the
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chinaman
clutches
the
aggressive
hands
,
resists
,
gasps
,
and
protests
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
say
?
"
   
<EOS>
A
watchful
pause
.
   
<EOS>
"
Unintelligible
!
"
   
<EOS>
Slowly
loosening
his
grasp
as
he
listens
to
the
incoherent
jargon
with
an
attentive
frown
,
he
turns
to
the
Lascar
and
fairly
drags
him
forth
upon
the
floor
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
falls
,
the
Lascar
starts
into
a
half
-
risen
attitude
,
glares
with
his
eyes
,
lashes
about
him
fiercely
with
his
arms
,
and
draws
a
phantom
knife
.
 
<EOS>
It
then
becomes
apparent
that
the
woman
has
taken
possession
of
this
knife
,
for
safety
's
sake
;
for
,
she
too
starting
up
,
and
restraining
and
expostulating
with
him
,
the
knife
is
visible
in
her
dress
,
not
in
his
,
when
they
drowsily
drop
back
,
side
by
side
.
   
<EOS>
There
has
been
chattering
and
clattering
enough
between
them
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
When
any
distinct
word
has
been
flung
into
the
air
,
it
has
had
no
sense
or
sequence
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
"
unintelligible
!
"
<EOS>
is
again
the
comment
of
the
watcher
,
made
with
some
reassured
nodding
of
his
head
,
and
a
gloomy
smile
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
lays
certain
silver
money
on
the
table
,
finds
his
hat
,
gropes
his
way
down
the
broken
stairs
,
gives
a
good
morning
to
some
rat
-
ridden
doorkeeper
,
in
bed
in
a
black
hutch
beneath
the
stairs
,
and
passes
out
.
   
<EOS>
That
same
afternoon
,
the
massive
gray
square
tower
of
an
old
Cathedral
rises
before
the
sight
of
a
jaded
traveller
.
 
<EOS>
The
bells
are
going
for
daily
vesper
service
,
and
he
must
needs
attend
it
,
one
would
say
,
from
his
haste
to
reach
the
open
Cathedral
door
.
<EOS>
The
choir
are
getting
on
their
sullied
white
robes
,
in
a
hurry
,
when
he
arrives
among
them
,
gets
on
his
own
robe
,
and
falls
into
the
procession
filing
in
to
service
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Sacristan
locks
the
iron
-
barred
gates
that
divide
the
sanctuary
from
the
chancel
,
and
all
of
the
procession
having
scuttled
into
their
places
,
hide
their
faces
;
and
then
the
intoned
words
,
"
WHEN
THE
WICKED
MAN
---
"
rise
among
groins
of
arches
and
beams
of
roof
,
awakening
muttered
thunder
.

Chapter

.
<EOS>
A
dean
,
and
a
chapter
<EOS>
also
 
Whosoever
has
observed
that
sedate
and
clerical
bird
,
the
rook
<EOS>
,
may
perhaps
have
noticed
that
when
he
wings
his
way
homeward
towards
nightfall
,
in
a
sedate
and
clerical
company
,
two
rooks
will
suddenly
detach
themselves
from
the
rest
,
will
retrace
their
flight
for
some
distance
,
and
will
there
poise
and
linger
;
conveying
to
mere
men
the
fancy
that
it
is
of
some
occult
importance
to
the
body
politic
,
that
this
artful
couple
should
pretend
to
have
renounced
connection
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
Similarly
,
service
being
over
in
the
old
Cathedral
with
the
square
tower
,
and
the
choir
scuffling
out
again
,
and
divers
venerable
persons
of
rook
-
like
aspect
dispersing
,
two
of
these
latter
retrace
their
steps
,
and
walk
together
in
the
echoing
Close
.
   
<EOS>
Not
only
is
the
day
waning
,
but
the
year
.
 
<EOS>
The
low
sun
is
fiery
and
yet
cold
behind
the
monastery
ruin
,
and
the
Virginia
creeper
on
the
Cathedral
wall
has
showered
half
its
deep
-
red
leaves
down
on
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
rain
this
afternoon
,
and
a
wintry
shudder
goes
among
the
little
pools
on
the
cracked
,
uneven
flag
-
stones
,
and
through
the
giant
elm
-
trees
as
they
shed
a
gust
of
tears
.
 
<EOS>
Their
fallen
leaves
lie
strewn
thickly
about
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
leaves
,
in
a
timid
rush
,
seek
sanctuary
within
the
low
arched
Cathedral
door
;
but
two
men
coming
out
resist
them
,
and
cast
them
forth
again
with
their
feet
;
this
done
,
one
of
the
two
locks
the
door
with
a
goodly
key
,
and
the
other
flits
away
with
a
folio
music
-
book
.

the

interposes
in

this
touch
of
correction
,
as
who
should
say
:
 
"
<EOS>
You
may
offer
bad

<EOS>
Mr
Tope
,
Chief
Verger
and
Showman
,
and
accustomed
to
be
high
with
excursion
parties
,
declines
with
a
silent
loftiness
to
perceive
that
any
suggestion
has
been
tendered
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
and
how
has
Mr

been
taken

,
as
Mr
Crisparkle
has
remarked
,
it
is
better
to

repeats
the
Dean
;

"
I
would

That

Mr

interposes
with
the

touch
as
before

"

not

by

indirect
homage

condescendingly
remarks
,
"

be
preferable

"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Jasper
's
breathing
was
so
remarkably
short
"
---
<EOS>
thus
discreetly
does
Mr
Tope
work
his
way
round
the
sunken
rock
---
"
when
he
came
in
,
that
it
distressed
him
mightily
to
get
his
notes
out
:
 
which
was
perhaps
the
cause
of
<EOS>
his
having
a
kind
of
fit
on
him
after
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
His
memory
grew
DAZED
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tope
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
Reverend
Mr
Crisparkle
,
shoots
this
word
out
,
as
defying
him
to
improve
upon
it
:
 
"
and
a
dimness
and
giddiness
crept
over
him
as
strange
as
ever
<EOS>
I
saw
:
 
though
he
did
n't
seem
to
mind
it
particularly
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
a
little
time
and
a
little
water
brought
him
out
of
his
DAZE
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tope
repeats
the
word
and
its
emphasis
,
with
the
air
of
saying
:
 
"
As
I
HAVE
made
a
success
,
I
'll
make
it
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Jasper
has
gone
home
quite
himself

has
he
?
"
asked
the
Dean
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
Reverence
,
he
has
gone
home
quite
himself
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'm
glad
to
see
he
's
having
his
fire
kindled
up
,
for
it
's
chilly
after
the
wet
,
and
the
Cathedral
had
both
a
damp
feel

They
all
three
look
towards
an
old
stone
gatehouse
crossing
the
Close
,
with
an
arched
thoroughfare
passing
beneath
it
.
 
<EOS>
Through
its
latticed
window
,
a
fire
shines
out
upon
the
fast
-
darkening
scene
,
involving
in
shadow
the
pendent
masses
of
ivy
and
creeper
covering
the
building
's
front
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
deep
Cathedral
-
bell
strikes
the
hour
,
a
ripple
of
wind
goes
through
these
at
their
distance
,
like
a
ripple
of
the
solemn
sound
that
hums
through
tomb
and
tower
,
broken
niche
and
defaced
statue
,
in
the
pile
close
at
hand

"
Is
Mr
Jasper
's
nephew
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
the
Dean
asks
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
Verger
,
"
but
expected
.
 
<EOS>
There
's
his
own
solitary
shadow
betwixt
his
two
windows
---
the
one
looking
this
way
,
and
the
one
looking
down
into
the
High
Street
---
drawing
his
own
curtains
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
says
the
Dean
,
with
a
sprightly
air
of
breaking
up
the
little
conference
,
<EOS>
"
I
hope
Mr
Jasper
's
heart
may
not
be
too
much
set
upon
his
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
Our
affections
,
however
laudable
,
in
this
transitory
world
,
should
never
master
us
;
we
should
guide
them
,
guide
them
.
 
<EOS>
I
find
I
am
not
disagreeably
reminded
of
my
dinner
,
by
hearing
my
dinner
-
bell
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
you
will
,
before
going
home
,
look
in
on
Jasper
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
Mr
Dean
.
 
<EOS>
And
tell
him
that
you
had
the
kindness
to
desire
to
know
how
he
was
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay

do
so

With
a
pleasant
air
of
patronage

the
Dean
as
nearly
cocks
his
quaint
hat
as

Dean

directs
his

The

with

He
looks
older

often
do

His
voice

deep

good

his

are
good

his
manner
is
a

sombre

His
room
is
a
little
sombre

may
have
had
its
influence
in
forming
his
manner

It
is

in

the
unfinished

of
a
blooming
schoolgirl
hanging
over
the
chimneypiece

her
flowing
brown
hair
tied
with
a
blue
riband

her
beauty
remarkable
for

quite
childish

almost
babyish
,
touch
of
saucy
discontent

comically
conscious
of
itself

(
There
is
not
the

artistic
merit
in
this

clear
that

humorously

revengefully

With
the
check
upon
him
of
being
unsympathetically
restrained
in
a
genial
outburst
of
enthusiasm
,
Mr

stands
still
,

looks
on
intently
at
the
young
fellow

divesting
himself
of
his
outward

forth

Once

exacting

watchful

devoted
affection

is
always

now

ever
afterwards
,
on

Mr

opens
a
door
at
the
upper
end
of
the

,
and
discloses
a
small
inner
room
pleasantly
lighted

prepared

a

in

setting

Fixed
as
the
look

is

there
is
yet
in
it
some
strange
power

suddenly
including
the

As

(

is
little
more

lays
a
hand
on
Jasper

Jasper
cordially

gaily
lays

interposes
,
taking

at

Little
to

glancing
up

sketch

complacency

then
shutting
one
eye

taking
a
corrected
prospect

it
over

bridge

in

"

,
in

tone
of
gentle
deprecation

Tut

<EOS>
Yes

Jack
,
it
's
all
very
well
for
YOU

<EOS>
YOU
can
take
it
easily
.
 
<EOS>
YOUR

is
not
laid
down
to
scale

lined

dotted
out
for
you

can

<EOS>
Life

is
a
plum
with
the
natural
bloom
on
;
it
has
n't
been
over

carefully
wiped
off

you

"
Good
Heaven

Jack

There
's
a
strange
film
come
over
your

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
,
with
a
forced
smile
,
stretches
out
his
right
hand
,
as
if
at
once
to
disarm
apprehension
and
gain
time
to
get
better
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
says
faintly
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
taking
opium
for
a
pain
---
an
agony
---
that
sometimes
overcomes
me
.
 
<EOS>
The
effects
of
the
medicine
steal
over
me
like
a
blight
or
a
cloud
,
and
pass
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
them
in
the
act
of
passing
;
they
will
be
gone
directly

<EOS>
Look
away

<EOS>
They
will
go
all
the
sooner

"
   
<EOS>
With
a
scared
face
the
younger
man
complies
by
casting
his
eyes
downward
at
the
ashes
on
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
Not
relaxing
his
own
gaze
on
the
fire
,
but
rather
strengthening
it
with
a
fierce
,
firm
grip
upon
his
elbow
-
chair
,
the
elder
sits
for
a
few
moments
rigid
,
and
then
,
with
thick
drops
standing
on
his
forehead
,
and
a
sharp
catch
of
his
breath
,
becomes
as
he
was
before
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
so
subsiding
in
his
chair
,
his
nephew
gently
and
assiduously
tends
him
while
he
quite
recovers
.
 
<EOS>
When
Jasper
is
restored
,
he
lays
a
tender
hand
upon
his
nephew
's
shoulder
,
and
,
in
a
tone
of
voice
less
troubled
than
the
purport
of
his
words
---
indeed
with
something
of
raillery
or
banter
in
 
it
---
thus
addresses
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
said
to
be
a
hidden
skeleton
in
every
house
;
but
you
thought
there
was
none
in
mine
,
dear
Ned
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
,
Jack
,
I
did
think
so
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
when
I
come
to
consider
that
even
in
Pussy
's
house
---
if
she
had
one
---
and
in
mine
---
if
I
had
one
---
"
   
"
You
were
going
to
say
(
but
that
I
interrupted
you
in
spite
of
myself
)
<EOS>
what
a
quiet
life
mine
is
.
 
<EOS>
No
whirl
and
uproar
around
me
,
no
distracting
commerce
or
calculation
,
no
risk
,
no
change
of
place
<EOS>
,
myself
devoted
to
the
art
I
pursue
,
my
business
my
pleasure
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
was
going
to
say
something
of
the
kind
,
Jack
;
but
you
see
,
<EOS>
you
,
speaking
of
yourself
,
almost
necessarily
leave
out
much
that
I
should
have
put
in
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
:
 
I
should
have
put
in
the
foreground
your
being
so
much
respected
as
Lay
Precentor
,
or
Lay
Clerk
,
or
<EOS>
whatever
you
call
it
,
of
this
Cathedral
;
your
enjoying
the
reputation
of
having
done
such
wonders
with
the
choir
;
your
choosing
your
society
,
and
holding
such
an
independent
position
in
this
queer
old
place
;
your
gift
of
teaching
(
why
,
even
Pussy
,
who
do
n't
like
being
taught
,
says
there
never
was
such
a
Master
as
you
are
!
)
,
and
your
connexion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
saw
what
you
were
tending
to
.
 
<EOS>
I
hate
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hate
it
,
Jack
?
"
 
<EOS>
(
Much
bewildered
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
I
hate
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
cramped
monotony
of
my
existence
grinds
me
away
by
the
grain
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
our
service
sound
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
Quite
celestial
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
often
sounds
to
me
quite
devilish
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
so
weary
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
echoes
of
my
own
voice
among
the
arches
seem
to
mock
me
with
my
daily
drudging
round
.
 
<EOS>
No
wretched
monk
who
droned
his
life
away
in
that
gloomy
place
,
before
me
,
can
have
been
more
tired
of
it
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
take
for
relief
(
and
did
take
)
to
carving
demons
out
of
the
stalls
and
seats
and
desks
.
 
<EOS>
What
shall
I
do
?
 
<EOS>
Must
I
take
to
carving
them
out
of
my
heart
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
so
exactly
found
your
niche
in
life
,
Jack
,
"
Edwin
Drood
returns
,
astonished
,
bending
forward
in
his
chair
to
lay
a
sympathetic
hand
on
Jasper
's
knee
,
and
looking
at
him
with
an
anxious
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
think
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
suppose
they
do
,
"
says
Edwin
,
meditating
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pussy
thinks
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
did
she
tell
you
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
last
time
I
was
here
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
when
.
 
<EOS>
Three
months
ago
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
she
phrase
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
she
only
said
that
she
had
become
your
pupil
,
and
that
you
were
made
for
your
vocation
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
younger
man
glances
at
the
portrait
.
 
<EOS>
The
elder
sees
it
in
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anyhow
,
my
dear
Ned
,
"
Jasper
resumes
,
as
he
shakes
his
head
with
a
grave
cheerfulness
,
"
I
must
subdue
myself
to
my
vocation
:
 
which
is
much
the
same
thing
outwardly
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
too
late
to
find
another
now
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
confidence
between
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
shall
be
sacredly
preserved
,
Jack
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
reposed
it
in
you
,
because
---
"
   
"
I
feel
it
,
I
assure
you
.
 
<EOS>
Because
we
are
fast
friends
,
and
because
you
love
and
trust
me
,
as
I
love
and
trust
you
.
 
<EOS>
Both
hands
,
Jack
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
each
stands
looking
into
the
other
's
eyes
,
and
as
the
uncle
holds
the
nephew
's
hands
,
the
uncle
thus
proceeds
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
now
,
do
n't
you
,
that
even
a
poor
monotonous
chorister
and
grinder
of
music
---
in
his
niche
---
may
be
troubled
with
some
stray
sort
of
ambition
,
aspiration
,
restlessness
,
dissatisfaction
,
what
shall
we
call
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
Jack
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
remember
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Jack
,
I
only
ask
you
,
am
I
likely
to
forget
what
you
have
said
with
so
much
feeling
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
it
as
a
warning
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
the
act
of
having
his
hands
released
,
and
of
moving
a
step
back
,
Edwin
pauses
for
an
instant
to
consider
the
application
of
these
last
words
.
 
<EOS>
The
instant
over
,
he
says
,
sensibly
touched
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
am
but
<EOS>
a
shallow
,
surface
kind
of
fellow
,
Jack
,
and
that
my
headpiece
is
none
of
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
need
n't
say
I
am
young
;
and
perhaps
I
shall
not
grow
worse
as
I
grow
older
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
hope
I
have
something
impressible
within
me
,
which
feels
---
<EOS>
deeply
feels
---
the
disinterestedness
of
your
painfully
laying
your
inner
self
bare
,
as
a
warning
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
's
steadiness
of
face
and
figure
becomes
so
marvellous
that
his
breathing
seems
to
have
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
fail
to
notice
,
Jack
,
that
it
cost
you
a
great
effort
,
and
that
you
were
very
much
moved
,
and
very
unlike
your
usual
self
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
knew
that
you
were
extremely
fond
of
me
,
but
I
really
was
not
prepared
for
your
,
as
I
may
say
,
sacrificing
yourself
to
me
in
that
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
,
becoming
a
breathing
man
again
without
the
smallest
stage
of
transition
between
the
two
extreme
states
,
lifts
his
shoulders
,
laughs
,
and
waves
his
right
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
do
n't
put
the
sentiment
away
,
Jack
;
please
do
n't
;
for
I
am
very
much
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
that
unhealthy
state
of
mind
which
you
have
so
powerfully
described
is
attended
with
some
real
suffering
,
and
is
hard
to
bear
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
me
reassure
you
,
Jack
,
as
to
the
chances
of
its
overcoming
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
am
in
the
way
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
some
few
months
less
than
another
year
,
you
know
,
I
shall
carry
Pussy
off
from
school
as
Mrs
Edwin
Drood
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
then
go
engineering
into
the
East
,
and
Pussy
with
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
we
have
our
little
tiffs
now
,
arising
out
of
a
certain
unavoidable
flatness
that
attends
our
love
-
making
,
owing
to
its
end
being
all
settled
beforehand
,
still
I
have
no
doubt
of
our
getting
on
capitally
then
,
when
it
's
done
and
ca
n't
be
helped
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Jack
,
to
go
back
to
the
old
song
I
was
freely
quoting
at
dinner
(
and
who
knows
old
songs
better
than
you
?
)
,
my
wife
shall
dance
,
and
I
will
sing
,
so
merrily
pass
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
Of
Pussy
's
being
beautiful
there
can
not
be
a
doubt
;
---
<EOS>
and
when
you
are
good
besides
,
Little
Miss
Impudence
,
"
once
more
apostrophising
the
portrait
<EOS>
,
"
I
'll
burn
your
comic
likeness
,
and
paint
your
music
-
master
another

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
,
with
his
hand
to
his
chin
,
and
with
an
expression
of
musing
benevolence
on
his
face
,
has
attentively
watched
every
animated
look
and
gesture
attending
the
delivery
of
these
words
.
<EOS>
He
remains
in
that
attitude
after
they
,
are
spoken
,
as
if
in
a
kind
of
fascination
attendant
on
his
strong
interest
in
the
youthful
spirit
that
he
loves
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
says
with
a
quiet
smile
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
be
warned
,
then
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

Jack

<EOS>
"
No

Jack

not
by
you

<EOS>
Besides
that
I
do
n't
really
consider
myself
in
danger
,
I
do
n't
like
your
putting
yourself
in
that
position

"
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
we
go
and
walk
in
the
churchyard
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means

<EOS>
You
wo
n't
mind
my
slipping
out
of
it
for
half
a
moment
to
the
Nuns

Only
gloves

years
old

Rather
poetical

<EOS>
Mr
Jasper

still
in
the

attitude
,
murmurs
:
 
"

Nothing

so

The

<EOS>
For
sufficient
reasons
,
which
this
narrative
will
itself
unfold
as
it
advances
,
a
fictitious
name
must
be
bestowed
upon
the
old
Cathedral
town
.
 
<EOS>
Let
it
stand
in
these
pages
as
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
once
possibly
known
to
the
Druids
by
another
name
,
and
certainly
to
the
Romans
by
another
,
and
to
the
Saxons
by
another
,
and
to
the
Normans
by
another
;
and
a
name
more
or
less
in
the
course
of
many
centuries
can
be
of
little
moment
to
its
dusty
chronicles
.
   
<EOS>
An
ancient
city
,
Cloisterham
,
and
<EOS>
no
meet
dwelling
-
place
for
any
one
with
hankerings
after
the
noisy
world
.
 
<EOS>
A
monotonous
,
silent
city
,
deriving
an
earthy
flavour
throughout
from
its
Cathedral
crypt
,
and
so
abounding
in
vestiges
of
monastic
graves
,
that
the
Cloisterham
children
grow
small
salad
in
the
dust
of
abbots
and
abbesses
,
and
make
dirt
-
pies
of
nuns
and
friars
;
while
every
ploughman
in
its
outlying
fields
renders
to
once
puissant
Lord
Treasurers
,
Archbishops
,
Bishops
,
and
such
-
like
,
the
attention
which
the
Ogre
in
the
story
-
book
desired
to
render
to
his
unbidden
visitor
,
and
grinds
their
bones
to
make
his
bread
.
   
<EOS>
A
drowsy
city
,
Cloisterham
,
whose
inhabitants
seem
to
suppose
,
with
an
inconsistency
more
strange
than
rare
,
that
all
its
changes
lie
behind
it
,
and
that
there
are
no
more
to
come
.
 
<EOS>
A
queer
moral
to
derive
from
antiquity
,
yet
older
than
any
traceable
antiquity
.
 
<EOS>
So
silent
are
the
streets
of
Cloisterham
(
though
prone
to
echo
on
the
smallest
provocation
)
,
that
of
a
summer
-
day
the
sunblinds
of
its
shops
scarce
dare
to
flap
in
the
south
wind
;
while
the
sun
-
browned
tramps
,
who
pass
along
and
stare
,
quicken
their
limp
a
little
,
that
they
may
the
sooner
get
beyond
the
confines
of
its
oppressive
respectability
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
feat
not
difficult
of
achievement
,
seeing
that
the
streets
of
Cloisterham
city
are
little
more
than
one
narrow
street
by
which
you
get
into
it
and
get
out
of
it
:
 
the
rest
being
mostly
disappointing
yards
with
pumps
in
them
and
no
thoroughfare
---
exception
made
of
the
Cathedral
-
close
,
and
a
paved
Quaker
settlement
,
in
colour
and
general
confirmation
very
like
a
Quakeress
's
bonnet
,
up
in
a
shady
corner
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
a
city
of
another
and
a
bygone
time
is
Cloisterham
,
with
its
hoarse
Cathedral
-
bell
,
its
hoarse
rooks
hovering
about
the
Cathedral
tower
,
its
hoarser
and
less
distinct
rooks
in
the
stalls
far
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
Fragments
of
old
wall
,
saint
's
chapel
,
chapter
-
house
,
convent
and
monastery
,
have
got
incongruously
or
obstructively
built
into
many
of
its
houses
and
gardens
,
much
as
kindred
jumbled
notions
have
become
incorporated
into
many
of
its
citizens
'
minds
.
<EOS>
All
things
in
it
are
of
the
past
.
 
<EOS>
Even
its
single
pawnbroker
takes
in
no
pledges
,
nor
has
he
for
a
long
time
,
but
offers
vainly
an
unredeemed
stock
for
sale
,
of
which
the
costlier
articles
are
dim
and
pale
old
watches
apparently
in
a
slow
perspiration
,
tarnished
sugar
-
tongs
with
ineffectual
legs
,
and
odd
volumes
of
dismal
books
.
<EOS>
The
most
abundant
and
the
most
agreeable
evidences
of
progressing
life
in
Cloisterham
are
the
evidences
of
vegetable
life
in
many
gardens
;
even
its
drooping
and
despondent
little
theatre
has
its
poor
strip
of
garden
,
receiving
the
foul
fiend
,
when
he
ducks
from
its
stage
into
the
infernal
regions
,
among
scarlet
-
beans
or
oyster
-
shells
,
according
to
the
season
of
the
year
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
Cloisterham
stands
the
Nuns
'
House
:
 
a
venerable
brick
edifice
,
whose
present
appellation
is
doubtless
derived
from
the
legend
of
its
conventual
uses
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
trim
gate
enclosing
its
old
courtyard
is
a
resplendent
brass
plate
flashing
forth
the
legend
:
 
<EOS>
"
Seminary
for
Young
Ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
house
-
front
is
so
old
and
worn
,
and
the
brass
plate
is
so
shining
and
staring
,
that
the
general
result
has
reminded
imaginative
strangers
of
a
battered
old
beau
with
a
large
modern
eye
-
glass
stuck
in
his
blind
eye
.
   
<EOS>
Whether
the
nuns
of
yore
,
being
of
a
submissive
rather
than
a
stiff
-
necked
generation
,
habitually
bent
their
contemplative
heads
to
avoid
collision
with
the
beams
in
the
low
ceilings
of
the
many
chambers
of
their
House
;
whether
they
sat
in
its
long
low
windows
telling
their
beads
for
their
mortification
,
instead
of
making
necklaces
of
them
for
their
adornment
;
whether
they
were
ever
walled
up
alive
in
odd
angles
and
jutting
gables
of
the
building
for
having
some
ineradicable
leaven
of
busy
mother
Nature
in
them
which
has
kept
the
fermenting
world
alive
ever
since
;
these
may
be
matters
of
interest
to
its
haunting
ghosts
(
if
any
)
,
but
constitute
no
item
in
Miss
Twinkleton
's
half
-
yearly
accounts
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
neither
of
Miss
Twinkleton
's
inclusive
regulars
,
nor
of
her
extras
.
<EOS>
The
lady
who
undertakes
the
poetical
department
of
the
establishment
at
so
much
(
or
so
little
)
<EOS>
a
quarter
has
no
pieces
in
her
list
of
recitals
bearing
on
such
unprofitable
questions
.
   
<EOS>
As
,
in
some
cases
of
drunkenness
,
and
in
others
of
animal
magnetism
,
there
are
two
states
of
consciousness
which
never
clash
,
but
each
of
which
pursues
its
separate
course
as
though
it
were
continuous
instead
of
broken
(
thus
,
if
I
hide
my
watch
when
I
am
drunk
,
I
must
be
drunk
again
before
I
can
remember
where
)
,
so
Miss
Twinkleton
has
two
distinct
and
separate
phases
of
being
.
 
<EOS>
Every
night
,
the
moment
the
young
ladies
have
retired
to
rest
,
does
Miss
Twinkleton
smarten
up
her
curls
a
little
,
brighten
up
her
eyes
a
little
,
and
become
a
sprightlier
Miss
Twinkleton
than
the
young
ladies
have
ever
seen
.
 
<EOS>
Every
night
,
at
the
same
hour
,
does
Miss
Twinkleton
resume
the
topics
of
the
previous
night
,
comprehending
the
tenderer
scandal
of
Cloisterham
,
of
which
she
has
no
knowledge
<EOS>
whatever
by
day
,
and
references
to
a
certain
season
at
Tunbridge
Wells
(
airily
called
by
Miss
Twinkleton
in
this
state
of
her
existence
"
The
Wells
"
)
,
notably
the
season
wherein
a
certain
finished
gentleman
(
compassionately
called
by
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
this
stage
of
her
existence
,
"
Foolish
Mr
Porters
"
)
revealed
a
homage
of
the
heart
,
whereof
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
her
scholastic
state
of
existence
,
is
as
ignorant
as
a
granite
pillar
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
's
companion
in
both
states
of
existence
,
and
equally
adaptable
to
either
,
is
one
<EOS>
Mrs
Tisher
:
 
a
deferential
widow
with
a
weak
back
,
a
chronic
sigh
,
and
a
suppressed
voice
,
who
looks
after
the
young
ladies
'
wardrobes
,
and
leads
them
to
infer
that
she
has
seen
better
days
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
this
is
the
reason
why
it
is
an
article
of
faith
with
the
servants
,
handed
down
from
race
to
race
,
that
the
departed
Tisher
was
a
hairdresser
.
   
<EOS>
The
pet
pupil
of
the
Nuns
'
House
is
Miss
Rosa
Bud
,
of
course
called
Rosebud
;
wonderfully
pretty
,
wonderfully
childish
,
wonderfully
whimsical
.
 
<EOS>
An
awkward
interest
(
awkward
because
romantic
)
attaches
to
Miss
Bud
in
the
minds
of
the
young
ladies
,
on
account
of
its
being
known
to
them
that
a
husband
has
been
chosen
for
her
by
will
and
bequest
,
and
that
her
guardian
is
bound
down
to
bestow
her
on
that
husband
when
he
comes
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
her
seminarial
state
of
existence
,
has
combated
the
romantic
aspect
of
this
destiny
by
affecting
to
shake
her
head
over
it
behind
Miss
Bud
's
dimpled
shoulders
,
and
to
brood
on
the
unhappy
lot
of
that
doomed
little
victim
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
no
better
effect
---
possibly
some
unfelt
touch
of
foolish
Mr
Porters
has
undermined
the
endeavour
---
than
to
evoke
from
the
young
ladies
an
unanimous
bedchamber
cry
of
"
O
,
what
a
pretending
old
thing
Miss
Twinkleton
is
,
my
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Nuns
'
House
is
never
in
such
a
state
of
flutter
as
when
this
allotted
husband
calls
to
see
little
Rosebud
.
 
<EOS>
(
It
is
unanimously
understood
by
the
young
ladies
that
he
is
lawfully
entitled
to
this
privilege
,
and
that
if
Miss
Twinkleton
disputed
it
,
she
would
be
instantly
taken
up
and
transported
.
)
 
<EOS>
When
his
ring
at
the
gate
-
bell
is
expected
,
or
takes
place
,
every
young
lady
who
can
,
under
any
pretence
,
look
out
of
window
,
looks
out
of
window
;
while
every
young
lady
who
is
"
practising
,
"
practises
out
of
time
;
and
the
French
class
becomes
so
demoralised
that
the
mark
goes
round
as
briskly
as
the
bottle
at
a
convivial
party
in
the
last
century
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
the
day
next
after
the
dinner
of
two
at
the
gatehouse
,
the
bell
is
rung
with
the
usual
fluttering
results

"
Mr
Edwin
Drood

Miss
Rosa

"
   
<EOS>
This
is
the
announcement
of
the
parlour
-
maid
in
chief
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
,
with
an
exemplary
air
of
melancholy
on
her
,
turns
to
the
sacrifice
,
and
says
,
"
You
may
go
down
,
my
dear

"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Bud
goes
down
,
followed
by
all
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Edwin
Drood
is
waiting
in
Miss
Twinkleton
's
own
parlour
:
 
a
dainty
room
,
with
nothing
more
directly
scholastic
in
it
than
a
terrestrial
and
a
celestial
globe
.
 
<EOS>
These
expressive
machines
imply
(
to
parents
and
guardians
)
that
even
when
Miss
Twinkleton
retires
into
the
bosom
of
privacy
,
duty
may
at
any
moment
compel
her
to
become
a
sort
of
Wandering
Jewess
,
scouring
the
earth
and
soaring
through
the
skies
in
search
of
knowledge
for
her
pupils
.
   
<EOS>
The
last
new
maid
,
who
has
never
seen
the
young
gentleman
Miss
Rosa
is
engaged
to
,
and
who
is
making
his
acquaintance
between
the
hinges
of
the
open
door
,
left
open
for
the
purpose
,
stumbles
guiltily
down
the
kitchen
stairs
,
as
a
charming
little
apparition
,
with
its
face
concealed
by
a
little
silk
apron
thrown
over
its
head
,
glides
into
the
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
IT
IS
so
ridiculous
!
"
<EOS>
says
the
apparition
,
stopping
and
shrinking
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't

Eddy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
what

Rosa

"
   
<EOS>
"
Do

come
any
nearer

<EOS>
It
IS
so
absurd

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
absurd
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
whole
thing
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
IS
so
absurd
to
be
an
engaged
orphan
<EOS>
and
it
IS
so
absurd
to
have
the
girls
and
the
servants
scuttling
about
after
one
,
like
mice
in
the
wainscot
;
and
it
IS
so
absurd
to
be
called
upon
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
apparition
appears
to
have
a
thumb
in
the
corner
of
its
mouth
while
making
this
complaint
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
give
me
an
affectionate
reception
,
Pussy
,
I
must
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well

I
will
in
a
minute
,
Eddy
,
but
<EOS>
I
ca

just
yet

<EOS>
How
are
you

"
<EOS>
(
very
shortly

<EOS>
"
I
am
unable

that
I

much
the
better

seeing
you

Pussy

"
   
<EOS>
This
second
remonstrance
brings
a
dark
,
bright
,
pouting
eye
out
from
a
corner
of
the
apron
;
but
it
swiftly
becomes
invisible
again
,
as
the
apparition
exclaims
:
 
<EOS>
"
O
good
gracious
!
<EOS>
you
have
had
half
your
hair
cut
off
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
done
better
to
have
had
my
head
cut
off
,
I
think
,
"
says
Edwin
,
rumpling
the
hair
in
question
,
with
a
fierce
glance
at
the
looking
-
glass
,
and
giving
an
impatient
stamp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
go
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
you
need
n't
go
just
yet
,
Eddy
.
 
<EOS>
The
girls
would
all
be
asking
questions
why
you
went
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Once
for
all
,
Rosa
,
will
you
uncover
that
ridiculous
little
head
of
yours
and
give
me
a
welcome
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
apron
is
pulled
off
the
childish
head
,
as
its
wearer
replies
:
"
<EOS>
You
're
very
welcome
,
Eddy
.
 
<EOS>
There

<EOS>
I
'm
sure
that
's
nice

<EOS>
Shake
hands

<EOS>
No

I
ca

you

because
I
've

an
acidulated
drop
in
my

"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
at
all
glad
to

me

O

Go

<EOS>
It
is
the
custom
of
that
excellent
lady
when
these
visits
occur
,
to
appear
every
three
minutes
,
either
in
her
own
person
or
in
that
of
Mrs
Tisher
,
and
lay
an
offering
on
the
shrine
of
Propriety
by
affecting
to
look
for
some
desiderated
article
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
Miss
Twinkleton
,
gracefully
gliding
in
and
out
,
says
in
passing
:
 
<EOS>
"
How

the

<EOS>
The
smallest
encouragement
thankfully
received
.
 
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
pass
your
birthday
,
Pussy
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Delightfully
!
 
<EOS>
Everybody
gave
me
a
present
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
had
a
feast
.
<EOS>
And
we
had
a
ball
at
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
feast
and
a
ball
,
eh
?
 
<EOS>
These
occasions
seem
to
go
off
tolerably
well
without
me
,
Pussy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
De
-
lightfully
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Rosa
,
in
a
quite
spontaneous
manner
,
and
without
the
least
pretence
of
reserve
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
And
what
was
the
feast
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tarts
,
oranges
,
jellies
,
and
shrimps
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
partners
at
the
ball
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
danced
with
one
another
,
of
course
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
some
of
the
girls
made
game
to
be
their
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
It
WAS
so
droll
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
anybody
make
game
to
be
---
"
   
"
To
be
you
?
 
<EOS>
O
dear
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
"
cries
Rosa
,
laughing
with
great
enjoyment
.
 
<EOS>
"
That
was
the
first
thing
done
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
did
it
pretty
well
,
"
says
Edwin
rather
doubtfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
it
was
excellent
!
<EOS>
---
I
would
n't
dance
with
you
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
scarcely
seems
to
see
the
force
of
this
;
begs
to
know
if
he
may
take
the
liberty
to
ask
why
?
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
was
so
tired
of
you
,
"
returns
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
quickly
adds
,
and
pleadingly
too
,
seeing
displeasure
in
his
face
:
 
<EOS>
"
Dear
Eddy
,
you
were
just
as
tired
of
me
,
you
know
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
I
say
so
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
so
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
ever
say
so
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
only
showed
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
she
did
it
so
well
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Rosa
,
in
a
sudden
ecstasy
with
her
counterfeit
betrothed
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
me
that
she
must
be
a
devilish
impudent
girl
,
"
says
Edwin
Drood
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
,
Pussy
,
you
have
passed
your
last
birthday
in
this
old
house
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
yes
!
"
<EOS>
Rosa
clasps
her
hands
,
looks
down
with
a
sigh
,
and
shakes
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
be
sorry
,
Rosa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
the
poor
old
place
.
 
<EOS>
Somehow
,
I
feel
as
if
it
would
miss
me
,
when
I
am
gone
so
far
away
,
so
young
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
had
better
stop
short
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
looks
up
at
him
with
a
swift
bright
look
;
next
moment
shakes
her
head
,
sighs
,
and
looks
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
,
is
it
,
Pussy
,
that
we
are
both
resigned
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
nods
her
head
again
,
and
after
a
short
silence
,
quaintly
bursts
out
with
:
 
"
You
know
we
must
be
married
,
and
married
from
here
,
Eddy
,
or
the
poor
girls
will
be
so
dreadfully
disappointed
!
"
   
<EOS>
For
the
moment
there
is
more
of
compassion
,
both
for
her
and
for
himself
,
in
her
affianced
husband
's
face
,
than
there
is
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
checks
the
look
,
and
asks
:
 
"
Shall
I
take
you
out
for
a
walk
,
Rosa
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
dear
does
not
seem
at
all
clear
on
this
point
,
until
her
face
,
which
has
been
comically
reflective
,
brightens
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
,
yes
,
Eddy
;
let
us
go
for
a
walk
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
.
 
<EOS>
You
shall
pretend
that
you
are
engaged
to
somebody
else
,
and
I
'll
pretend
that
I
am
not
engaged
to
anybody
,
and
then
we
sha
n't
quarrel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
that
will
prevent
our
falling
out
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
will
.
 
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
Pretend
to
look
out
of
window
---
Mrs
Tisher
!
"
   
<EOS>
Through
a
fortuitous
concourse
of
accidents
,
the
matronly
Tisher
heaves
in
sight
,
says
,
in
rustling
through
the
room
like
the
legendary
ghost
of
a
dowager
in
silken
skirts
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
see
Mr
Drood
well
;
though
I
need
n't
ask
,
if
I
may
judge
from
his
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
I
disturb
no
one
;
but
there
WAS
a
paper
-
knife
---
<EOS>
O
,
thank
you
,
I
am
sure
!
"
and
disappears
with
her
prize
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
other
thing
you
must
do
,
Eddy
,
to
oblige
me
,
"
says
Rosebud
.
<EOS>
"
The
moment
we
get
into
the
street
,
you
must
put
me
outside
,
and
keep
close
to
the
house
yourself
---
squeeze
and
graze
yourself
against
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
all
means
,
Rosa
,
if
you
wish
it
.
 
<EOS>
Might
I
ask
why
?
"
   
"
O
!
<EOS>
because
I
do
n't
want
the
girls
to
see
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fine
day
;
but
would
you
like
me
to
carry
an
umbrella
up
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
foolish
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
n't
got
polished
leather
boots
on
,
"
pouting
,
with
one
shoulder
raised
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
that
might
escape
the
notice
of
the
girls
,
even
if
they
did
see
me
,
"
remarks
Edwin
,
looking
down
at
his
boots
with
a
sudden
distaste
for
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
escapes
their
notice
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
I
know
what
would
happen
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
would
begin
reflecting
on
me
by
saying
(
for
THEY
are
free
)
that
they
never
will
on
any
account
engage
themselves
to
lovers
without
polished
leather
boots
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
for
leave
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
That
discreet
lady
being
indeed
heard
without
,
inquiring
of
nobody
in
a
blandly
conversational
tone
as
she
advances
:
 
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
!
<EOS>
Are
you
quite
sure
you
saw
my
mother
-
of
-
pearl
button
-
holder
on
the
work
-
table
in
my
room
?
<EOS>
"
is
at
once
solicited
for
walking
leave
,
and
graciously
accords
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
soon
the
young
couple
go
out
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
taking
all
precautions
against
the
discovery
of
the
so
vitally
defective
boots
of
Mr
Edwin
Drood
:
 
<EOS>
precautions
,
let
us
hope
,
effective
for
the
peace
of
Mrs
Edwin
Drood
that
is
to
be
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
way
shall
we
take
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
replies
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
to
the
Lumps
-
of
-
Delight
shop
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
the
---
?
"
   
"
A
Turkish
sweetmeat
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
My
gracious
me
,
do
n't
you
understand
anything
?
 
<EOS>
Call
yourself
an
Engineer
,
and
not
know
THAT
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
should
I
know
it
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
am
very
fond
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
O
!
<EOS>
I
forgot
what
we
are
to
pretend
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
need
n't
know
anything
about
them
;
never
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
he
is
gloomily
borne
off
to
the
Lumps
-
of
-
Delight
shop
,
where
Rosa
makes
her
purchase
,
and
,
after
offering
some
to
him
(
which
he
rather
indignantly
declines
)
,
begins
to
partake
of
it
with
great
zest
:
 
previously
taking
off
and
rolling
up
a
pair
of
little
pink
gloves
,
like
rose
-
leaves
,
and
occasionally
putting
her
little
pink
fingers
to
her
rosy
lips
,
to
cleanse
them
from
the
Dust
of
Delight
that
comes
off
the
Lumps
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
be
a
good
-
tempered
Eddy
,
and
pretend
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
you
are
engaged
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
am
engaged
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
she
nice
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Charming
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tall
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Immensely
tall
!
"
 
<EOS>
Rosa
being
short
.
   
<EOS>
"
Must
be
gawky
,
I
should
think

is
Rosa
's
quiet
commentary
.
   
<EOS>

I
beg
your
pardon
;
not
at
all

contradiction
rising
in
him

What

termed
a
fine
woman

a
splendid
woman

"
   
<EOS>
"
Big
nose
,
no
doubt
,
"
is
the
quiet
commentary
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
little
one
,
certainly
,
"
is
the
quick
reply
,
(
Rosa
's
being
a
little
one
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Long
pale
nose
,
with
a
red
knob
in
the
middle
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
the
sort
of
nose
,
"
says
Rosa
,
with
a
satisfied
nod
,
and
tranquilly
enjoying
the
Lumps
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
DON'T
know
the
sort
of
nose
,
Rosa
,
"
with
some
warmth
;
"
because
it
's
nothing
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
pale
nose
,
Eddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
 
Determined
not
to
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
red
nose
?
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
red
noses
.
 
<EOS>
However
;
to
be
sure
she
can
always
powder
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
would
scorn
to
powder
it
,
"
says
Edwin
,
becoming
heated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Would
she
?
 
<EOS>
What
a
stupid
thing
she
must
be
!
 
<EOS>
Is
she
stupid
in
everything
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
in
nothing
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
pause
,
in
which
the
whimsically
wicked
face
has
not
been
unobservant
of
him
,
Rosa
says
:
   
"
<EOS>
And
this
most
sensible
of
creatures
likes
the
idea
of
being
carried
off
to
Egypt
;
<EOS>
does
she
,
Eddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
She
takes
a
sensible
interest
in
triumphs
of
engineering
skill
:
 
especially
when
they
are
to
change
the
whole
condition
of
an
undeveloped
country
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Lor
!
"
says
Rosa
,
shrugging
her
shoulders
,
with
a
little
laugh
of
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
object
,
"
Edwin
inquires
,
with
a
majestic
turn
of
his
eyes
downward
upon
the
fairy
figure
:
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
object
,
Rosa
,
to
her
feeling
that
interest

"
   
<EOS>
"
Object
?
<EOS>
my
dear
Eddy
!
 
<EOS>
But
really
,
does
n't
she
hate
boilers
and
things
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
for
her
not
being
so
idiotic
as
to
hate
Boilers
,
"
he
returns
with
angry
emphasis
;
"
though
I
can
not
answer
for
her
views
about
Things

really
not
understanding
what
Things
are
meant

<EOS>

But
do

hate

Certainly
not

Very

At

Why
should
she
be
such
a

tall

as
to
hate

Rosa

Ah

you
should
hear
Miss

often
nodding
her
head

much
enjoying

bore
about

Tiresome
old

And
then
there
was
Belzoni

dragged
out

legs

half

choked
with
bats

dust

All
the

hope
it
hurt
him

quite

<EOS>
The
two
youthful
figures
,
side
by
side
,
but
not
now
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
wander
discontentedly
about
the
old
Close
;
and
each
sometimes
stops
and
slowly
imprints
a
deeper
footstep
in
the
fallen
leaves

Well

silence

cries
Rosa
,
in
a
little
burst
of
comical
contradictory
spleen
.
   
<EOS>
"
Somehow

other

I
never

come
right
in

says
Edwin

sighing

becoming
resigned

How
is
it
possible

that
you
ever
can
come
right
when
you
're
always
wrong

as

I

dead

sure
I

he

his

concern
you

<EOS>
"
It
is
nearly
time
for
your
return

Rosa

We

not
had
a

happy
walk

have
we

"
   
<EOS>
"
A
happy
walk
?
 
<EOS>
A
detestably
unhappy
walk
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
go
up
-
stairs
<EOS>
the
moment
I
get
in
and
cry
till
I
ca
n't
take
my
dancing
lesson
,
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
be
friends
,
Rosa

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Rosa
,
shaking
her
head
and
bursting
into
real
tears
<EOS>
,
"
I
wish
we
COULD
be
friends
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
because
we
ca
n't
be
friends
,
that
we
try
one
another
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
young
little
thing
<EOS>
,
Eddy
,
to
have
an
old
heartache
;
but
I
really
,
really
have
,
sometimes
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
angry
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
one
yourself
too
often

We
should
both
of
us
have
done
better
,
if
What
is
to
be
had
been
left
What
might
have
been
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
a
little
serious
thing
now
,
and
not
teasing
you
.
<EOS>
Let
each
of
us
forbear
,
this
one
time
,
on
our
own
account

and
on
the

"
   
<EOS>
Disarmed
by
this
glimpse
of
a
woman
's
nature
in
the
spoilt
child
,
though
for
an
instant
disposed
to
resent
it
as
seeming
to
involve
the
enforced
infliction
of
himself
upon
her
,
Edwin
Drood
stands
watching
her
as
she
childishly
cries
and
sobs
,
with
both
hands
to
the
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
,
and
then
---
she
becoming
more
composed
,
and
indeed
beginning
in
her
young
inconstancy
to
laugh
at
herself
for
having
been
so
moved
---
leads
her
to
a
seat
hard
by
,
under
the
elm
-
trees
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
clear
word
of
understanding
,
Pussy
dear

<EOS>
I
am
not
clever
out
of
my

come
to
think
of
it

I
do

I

clever

I
want
to
do
right

There
is
not

there
may
be

I
really
do
n't
see
my
way
to
what
I
want
to
say
,

I
must
say
it
before
we
part

there
is
not
any
other
young

"
   
"
<EOS>
O
no
,
Eddy
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
generous
of
you
to
ask
me
;
but
no
,
no
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
have
come
very
near
to
the
Cathedral
windows
,
and
at
this
moment
the
organ
and
the
choir
sound
out
sublimely
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
sit
listening
to
the
solemn
swell
,
the
confidence
of
last
night
rises
in
young
Edwin
Drood
's
mind
,
and
he
thinks
how
unlike
this
music
is
to
that
discordance
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
fancy
I
can
distinguish
Jack
's
voice
,
"
is
his
remark
in
a
low
tone
in
connection
with
the
train
of
thought
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
me
back
at
once
,
please
,
"
urges
his
Affianced
,
quickly
laying
her
light
hand
upon
his
wrist
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
will
all
be
coming
out
directly
;
let

get
away

<EOS>
O

what
a
resounding
chord
!
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
let
us
stop
to
listen
to
it
;
let
us
get
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
hurry
is
over
as
soon
as
they
have
passed
out
of
the
Close
.
<EOS>
They
go
arm
-
in
-
arm
now
,
gravely
and
deliberately
enough
,
along
the
old
High
-
street
,
to
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
gate
,
the
street
being
within
sight
empty
,
Edwin
bends
down
his
face
to
Rosebud
's
.
   
<EOS>
She
remonstrates
,
laughing
,
and
is
a
childish
schoolgirl
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eddy
,
no
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
too
sticky
to
be
kissed
.
 
<EOS>
But
give
me
your
hand
,
and
I
'll
blow
a
kiss
into
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
does
so
.
 
<EOS>
She
breathes
a
light
breath
into
it
and
asks
,
retaining
it
and
looking
into
it
:
---
   
<EOS>
"
Now
say
,
what
do
you
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
See
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
thought
you
Egyptian
boys
could
look
into
a
hand
and
see
all
sorts
of
phantoms
.
 
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
see
a
happy
Future
?
"
   
<EOS>
For
certain
,
neither
of
them
sees
a
happy
Present
,
as
the
gate
opens
and
closes
,
and
one
goes
in
,
and
the
other
goes
away

<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
 
<EOS>
Accepting
the
Jackass
as
the
type
of
self
-
sufficient
stupidity
and
conceit
---
a
custom
,
perhaps
,
like
some
few
other
customs
,
more
conventional
than
fair
---
then
the
purest
jackass
in
Cloisterham
is
Mr
Thomas
Sapsea
,
Auctioneer
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
"
dresses
at
"
the
Dean
;
has
been
bowed
to
for
the
Dean
,
in
mistake
;
has
even
been
spoken
to
in
the
street
as
My
Lord
,
under
the
impression
that
he
was
the
Bishop
come
down
unexpectedly
,
without
his
chaplain
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
is
very
proud
of
this
,
and
of
his
voice
,
and
of
his
style
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
even
(
in
selling
landed
property
)
tried
the
experiment
of
slightly
intoning
in
his
pulpit
,
to
make
himself
more
like
what
he
takes
to
be
the
genuine
ecclesiastical
article
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
in
ending
a
Sale
by
Public
Auction
,
Mr
Sapsea
finishes
off
with
an
air
of
bestowing
a
benediction
on
the
assembled
brokers
,
which
leaves
the
real
Dean
---
a
modest
and
worthy
gentleman
---
far
behind
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
has
many
admirers
;
indeed
,
the
proposition
is
carried
by
a
large
local
majority
,
even
including
non
-
believers
in
his
wisdom
,
that
he
is
a
credit
to
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
He
possesses
the
great
qualities
of
being
portentous
and
dull
,
and
of
having
a
roll
in
his
speech
,
and
another
roll
in
his
gait
;
not
to
mention
a
certain
gravely
flowing
action
with
his
hands
,
as
if
he
were
presently
going
to
Confirm
the
individual
with
whom
he
holds
discourse
.
 
<EOS>
Much
nearer
sixty
years
of
age
than
fifty
,
with
a
flowing
outline
of
stomach
,
and
horizontal
creases
in
his
waistcoat
;
reputed
to
be
rich
;
voting
at
elections
in
the
strictly
respectable
interest
;
morally
satisfied
that
nothing
but
<EOS>
he
himself
has
grown
since
he
was
a
baby
;
how
can
dunder
-
headed
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
be
otherwise
than
a
credit
to
Cloisterham
,
and
society
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
's
premises
are
in
the
High
-
street
,
over
against
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
of
about
the
period
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
irregularly
modernised
here
<EOS>
and
there
,
as
steadily
deteriorating
generations
found
,
more
and
more
,
that
they
preferred
air
and
light
to
Fever
and
the
Plague
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
doorway
is
a
wooden
effigy
,
about
half
life
-
size
,
representing
Mr
Sapsea
's
father
,
in
a
curly
wig
and
toga
,
in
the
act
of
selling
.
 
<EOS>
The
chastity
of
the
idea
,
and
the
natural
appearance
of
the
little
finger
,
hammer
,
and
pulpit
,
have
been
much
admired
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
sits
in
his
dull
ground
-
floor
sitting
-
room
,
giving
first
on
his
paved
back
yard
;
and
then
on
his
railed
-
off
garden
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
has
a
bottle
of
port
wine
on
a
table
before
the
fire
---
the
fire
is
an
early
luxury
,
but
pleasant
on
the
cool
,
chilly
autumn
evening
---
and
is
characteristically
attended
by
his
portrait
,
his
eight
-
day
clock
,
and
his
weather
-
glass
.
 
<EOS>
Characteristically
,
because
he
would
uphold
himself
against
mankind
,
his
weather
-
glass
against
weather
,
and
his
clock
against
time
.
   
<EOS>
By
Mr
Sapsea
's
side
on
the
table
are
a
writing
-
desk
and
writing
materials
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
at
a
scrap
of
manuscript
,
Mr
Sapsea
reads
it
to
himself
with
a
lofty
air
,
and
then
,
slowly
pacing
the
room
with
his
thumbs
in
the
arm
-
holes
of
his
waistcoat
,
repeats
it
from
memory
:
 
so
internally
,
though
with
much
dignity
,
that
the
word
"
Ethelinda
"
is
alone
audible
.
   
<EOS>
There
are
three
clean
wineglasses
in
a
tray
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
His
serving
-
maid
entering
,
and
announcing
"
Mr
Jasper
is
come
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
Mr
Sapsea
waves
"
Admit
him
,
"
and
draws
two
wineglasses
from
the
rank
,
as
being
claimed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Glad
to
see
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
congratulate
myself
on
having
the
honour
of
receiving
you
here
for
the
first
time
.
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
does
the
honours
of
his
house
in
this
wise
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
good
.
 
<EOS>
The
honour
is
mine
and
the
self
-
congratulation
is
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
pleased
to
say
so
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
assure
you
that
it
is
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
receive
you
in
my
humble
home
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
is
what
I
would
not
say
to
everybody
.
"
 
<EOS>
Ineffable
loftiness
on
Mr
Sapsea
's
part
accompanies
these
words
,
as
leaving
the
sentence
to
be
understood
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
easily
believe
that
your
society
can
be
a
satisfaction
to
a
man
like
myself
;
nevertheless
,
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
for
some
time
desired
to
know
you
,
Mr
Sapsea
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
,
sir
,
have
long
known
you
by
reputation
as
a
man
of
taste
.
<EOS>
Let
me
fill
your
glass
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
,
sir
,
"
says
Mr
Sapsea
,
filling
his
own
:
   
<EOS>
"
When
the
French
come
over
,
May
we
meet
them
at
Dover
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
a
patriotic
toast
in
Mr
Sapsea
's
infancy
,
and
he
is
therefore
fully
convinced
of
its
being
appropriate
to
any
subsequent
era
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
scarcely
be
ignorant
,
Mr
Sapsea
,
"
observes
Jasper
,
watching
the
auctioneer
with
a
smile
as
the
latter
stretches
out
his
legs
before
the
fire
,
"
that
you
know
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
"
is
the
chuckling
reply
,
"
I
think
I
know
something
of
it
;
something
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Your
reputation
for
that
knowledge
has
always
interested
and
surprised
me
,
and
made
me
wish
to
know
you
.
 
<EOS>
For
Cloisterham
is
a
little
place
.
 
<EOS>
Cooped
up
in
it
myself
,
I
know
nothing
beyond
it
,
and
feel
it
to
be
a
very
little
place
.

<EOS>
"
If
I
have
not
gone

Mr
Sapsea
begins
,
and
then
stops
:

foreign

They
have
come

me
in

business

I
have
improved
upon
my
opportunities

<EOS>
Put
it
that
I
take
an
inventory

make

<EOS>
I
see
a
French
clock

<EOS>
I
never
saw
him
before
,
in
my

but
I
instantly
lay
my
finger
on
him
and
say
"
Paris

"
 
<EOS>
I
see
some
cups
and
saucers
of
Chinese
make
,
equally
strangers
to
me
personally
:
 
<EOS>
I
put
my
finger
on
them
,
then
<EOS>
and
there
,
and
I
say
"
Pekin
,
Nankin
,
and
Canton

<EOS>
It
is
the
same
with
Japan
,
with
Egypt
,
and
with
bamboo
and
sandalwood
from
the
East
Indies
;
I
put
my
finger
on
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
my
finger
on
the
North
Pole
before
now
,
and
said
"
Spear

for
half
a

<EOS>
"
   
"
Really

<EOS>
A
very
remarkable
way

acquiring

men

things

I
mention
it

Mr

rejoins

with

it

Mr

fills

again

holding
it
up

which
is
BUT
a
trifle

still
has
required
some
thought

sir

some
little
fever

I
ought
perhaps
to
describe

<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
,
in
the
act
of
yawning
behind
his
wineglass
,
puts
down
that
screen
and
calls
up
a
look
of
interest
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
little
impaired
in
its
expressiveness

his
having
a
shut

with

Half
a
dozen
years
ago

so

Mr
Sapsea
proceeds
,

<EOS>
when
I
had
enlarged
my
mind
up
to
---
I
will
not
say
to
what
it
now
is
,
for
that
might
seem
to
aim
at
too
much
,
but
up
to
the
pitch
of
wanting
another
mind
to
be
absorbed
in
it
---
I
cast
my
eye
about
me
for
a
nuptial
partner
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
as
I
say
,
it
is
not
good
for
man
to
be
alone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
appears
to
commit
this
original
idea
to
memory
.

"
Miss
Brobity
at
that
time
kept
,
I
will
not
call
it
the
rival
establishment
to
the
establishment
at
the
Nuns
'
House
opposite
,
but
I
will
call
it
the
other
parallel
establishment
down
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
did
have
it
that
she
showed
a
passion
for
attending
my
sales
,
when
they
took
place
on
half
holidays
,
or
in
vacation
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
did
put
it
about
,
that
she
admired
my
style
.
 
<EOS>
The
world
did
notice
that
as
time
flowed
by
,
my
style
became
traceable
in
the
dictation
-
exercises
of
Miss
Brobity
's
pupils
.
 
<EOS>
Young
man

a
whisper
even
sprang
up
in
obscure
malignity

that
one
ignorant
and
besotted
Churl
(
a
parent
)
<EOS>
so
committed
himself
as
to
object
to
it
by
name

<EOS>
But
I
do
not
believe
this
.
 
<EOS>
For
is
it
likely
that
any
human
creature
in
his
right
senses
would
so
lay
himself
open
to
be
pointed
at
,
by
what
I
call
the
finger
of
scorn
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
shakes
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
Not
in
the
least
likely
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
,
in
a
grandiloquent
state
of
absence
of
mind
,
seems
to
refill
his
visitor
's
glass
,
which
is
full
already
;
and
does
really
refill
his
own
,
which
is
empty
.
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Brobity
's
Being
,
young
man
,
was
deeply
imbued
with
homage
to
Mind
.
 
<EOS>
She
revered
Mind
,
when
launched
,
or
,
as
I
say
,
precipitated
,
on
an
extensive
knowledge
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
made
my
proposal
,
she
did
me
the
honour
to
be
so
overshadowed
with
a
species
of
Awe
,
as
to
be
able
to
articulate
only
the
two
words
,
"
O
Thou
!
"
<EOS>
meaning
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Her
limpid
blue
eyes
were
fixed
upon
me
,
her
semi
-
transparent
hands
were
clasped
together
,
pallor
overspread
her
aquiline
features
,
and
,
though
encouraged
to
proceed
,
she
never
did
proceed
a
word
further
.
 
<EOS>
I
disposed
of
the
parallel
establishment
by
private
contract
,
and
we
became
as
nearly
one
as
could
be
expected
under
the
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
never
could
,
and
she
never
did
<EOS>
,
find
a
phrase
satisfactory
to
her
perhaps
-
too
-
favourable
estimate
of
my
intellect
.
 
<EOS>
To
the
very
last
(
feeble
action
of
liver
)
,
she
addressed
me
in
the
same
unfinished
terms
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
has
closed
his
eyes
as
the
auctioneer
has
deepened
his
voice
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
abruptly
opens
them
,
and
says
,
in
unison
with
the
deepened
voice
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
---
rather
as
if
stopping
himself
on
the
extreme
verge
of
adding
---
"
men
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
since
,
"
says
Mr
Sapsea
,
with
his
legs
stretched
out
,
and
solemnly
enjoying
himself
with
the
wine
and
the
fire
,
"
what
you
behold
me
;
I
have
been
since
a
solitary
mourner
;
I
have
been
since
,
as
I
say
,
wasting
my
evening
conversation
on
the
desert
air
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
I
have
reproached
myself
;
but
there
have
been
times
when
I
have
asked
myself
the
question
:
 
What
if
her
husband
had
been
nearer
on
a
level
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
If
she
had
not
had
to
look
up
quite
so
high
,
what
might
the
stimulating
action
have
been
upon
the
liver
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
says
,
with
an
appearance
of
having
fallen
into
dreadfully
low
spirits
,
that
he
"
supposes
it
was
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
can
only
suppose
so

sir
,
"
Mr
Sapsea
coincides
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
say
,
Man
proposes
,
Heaven
disposes
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
or
may
not
be
putting
the
same
thought
in
another
form
;
but
that
is
the
way
I
put
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
murmurs
assent
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr
Jasper
,
"
resumes
the
auctioneer
,
producing
his
scrap
of
manuscript
<EOS>
,
"

Mr

complying

sees

reads

Whose
Knowledge
of

Though
somewhat

Never
brought
him
acquainted
with
A
SPIRIT
More
capable
of
LOOKING
UP
TO
HIM

<EOS>
STRANGER

And
ask
thyself

Question

CANST
THOU

LIKEWISE

<EOS>
If
Not

WITH
A
BLUSH
RETIRE

<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
having
risen
and
stationed
himself
with
his
back
to
the
fire
,
for
the
purpose
of
observing
the
effect
of
these
lines
on
the
countenance
of
a
man
of
taste
,
consequently
has
his
face
towards
the
door
,
when
his
serving
-
maid
,
again
appearing
,
announces
,
"
Durdles
is
come
,
sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
promptly
draws
forth
and
fills
the
third
wineglass
,
as
being
now
claimed
,
and
replies
,
"
Show
Durdles
in

<EOS>
"
   
"
Admirable

<EOS>
quoth
Mr
Jasper
,
handing
back
the
paper
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
approve
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Impossible
not
to
approve
.
 
<EOS>
Striking
,
characteristic
,
and
complete
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
auctioneer
inclines
his
head
,
as
one
accepting
his
due
and
giving
a
receipt
;
and
invites
the
entering
Durdles
to
take
off
that
glass
of
wine
(
handing
the
same
)
,
for
it
will
warm
him
.
   
<EOS>
Durdles
is
a
stonemason
;
chiefly
in
the
gravestone
,
tomb
,
and
monument
way
,
and
wholly
of
their
colour
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
is
better
known
in
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
the
chartered
libertine
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Fame
trumpets
him
a
wonderful
workman
---
which
,
for
aught
that
anybody
knows
,
he
may
be
(
as
he
never
works
)
;
and
a
wonderful
sot
---
which
everybody
knows
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
Cathedral
crypt
he
is
better
acquainted
than
any
living
authority
;
it
may
even
be
than
any
dead
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
the
intimacy
of
this
acquaintance
began
in
his
habitually
resorting
to
that
secret
place
,
to
lock
-
out
the
Cloisterham
boy
-
populace
,
and
sleep
off
fumes
of
liquor
:
 
he
having
ready
access
to
the
Cathedral
,
as
contractor
for
rough
repairs
.
 
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
may
,
he
does
know
much
about
it
,
and
,
in
the
demolition
of
impedimental
fragments
of
wall
,
buttress
,
and
pavement
,
has
seen
strange
sights
.
 
<EOS>
He
often
speaks
of
himself
in
the
third
person
;
perhaps
,
being
a
little
misty
as
to
his
own
identity
,
when
he
narrates
;
perhaps
impartially
adopting
the
Cloisterham
nomenclature
in
reference
to
a
character
of
acknowledged
distinction
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
he
will
say
,
touching
his
strange
sights
:
 
<EOS>
"
Durdles
come
upon
the
old
chap
,
"
in
reference
to
a
buried
magnate
of
ancient
time
and
high
degree
,
"
by
striking
right
into
the
coffin
with
his
pick
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
chap
gave
Durdles
a
look
with
his
open
eyes
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Is
your
name
Durdles
?
 
<EOS>
Why
,
my
man
,
I
've
been
waiting
for
you
a
devil
of
a
time
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
turned
to
powder
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
a
two
-
foot
rule
always
in
his
pocket
,
and
a
mason
's
hammer
all
but
always
in
his
hand
,
Durdles
goes
continually
sounding
and
tapping
all
about
and
about
the
Cathedral
;
and
whenever
he
says
to
Tope
:
 
<EOS>
"
Tope
,
here
's
another
old
'
un
in
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
Tope
announces
it
to
the
Dean
as
an
established
discovery
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
suit
of
coarse
flannel
with
horn
buttons
,
a
yellow
neckerchief
with
draggled
ends
,
an
old
hat
more
russet
-
coloured
than
black
,
and
laced
boots
of
the
hue
of
his
stony
calling
,
Durdles
leads
a
hazy
,
gipsy
sort
of
life
,
carrying
his
dinner
about
with
him
in
a
small
bundle
,
and
sitting
on
all
manner
of
tombstones
to
dine
.
 
<EOS>
This
dinner
of
Durdles
's
has
become
quite
a
Cloisterham
institution
:
not
only
because
of
his
never
appearing
in
public
without
it
,
but
because
of
its
having
been
,
on
certain
renowned
occasions
,
taken
into
custody
along
with
Durdles
(
as
drunk
and
incapable
)
,
and
exhibited
before
the
Bench
of
justices
at
the
townhall
.
 
<EOS>
These
occasions
,
however
,
have
been
few
and
far
apart
:
 
Durdles
being
as
seldom
drunk
as
sober
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
he
is
an
old
bachelor
,
and
he
lives
in
a
little
antiquated
hole
of
a
house
that
was
never
finished
:
 
<EOS>
supposed
to
be
built
,
so
far
,
of
stones
stolen
from
the
city
wall
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
abode
there
is
an
approach
,
ankle
-
deep
in
stone
chips
,
resembling
a
petrified
grove
of
tombstones
,
urns
,
draperies
,
and
broken
columns
,
in
all
stages
of
sculpture
.
 
<EOS>
Herein
two
journeymen
incessantly
chip
,
while
other
two
journeymen
,
who
face
each
other
,
incessantly
saw
stone
;
dipping
as
regularly
in
and
out
of
their
sheltering
sentry
-
boxes
,
as
if
they
were
mechanical
figures
emblematical
of
Time
and
Death
.
   
<EOS>
To
Durdles
,
when
he
had
consumed
his
glass
of
port
,
Mr
Sapsea
intrusts
that
precious
effort
of
his
Muse
.
 
<EOS>
Durdles
unfeelingly
takes
out
his
two
-
foot
rule
,
and
measures
the
lines
calmly
,
alloying
them
with
stone
-
grit
.
   
<EOS>

This

leaves
you
to

---
Is
this

"

Mr

,
with
an
Author
's
anxiety
to
rush
into
publication
,
replies
that
it
can
not

takes

unlocks

let

doggedly

is
the
heaviest
of
the
three

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
'em
much
of
a
muchness
,
I
expect
,
"
says
Durdles
.
<EOS>
"
They
all
belong
to
monuments
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
open
Durdles
's
work
.
<EOS>
Durdles
keeps
the
keys
of
his
work
mostly
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
they
're
much
used
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
the
bye
,
"
it
comes
into
Jasper
's
mind
to
say
,
as
he
idly
examines
the
keys
,
"
I
have
been
going
to
ask
you
,
many
a
day
,
and
have
always
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
they
sometimes
call
you
Stony
Durdles
,
do
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Cloisterham
knows
me
as
Durdles
,
Mr
Jasper
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
of
that
,
of
course
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
boys
sometimes
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
O
!
<EOS>
if
you
mind
them
young
imps
of
boys
---
"
Durdles
gruffly
interrupts
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mind
them
any
more
than
you
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
discussion
the
other
day
among
the
Choir
,
whether
Stony
stood
for
Tony
;
"
clinking
one
key
against
another
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
Take
care
of
the
wards
,
Mr
Jasper
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
whether
Stony
stood
for
Stephen
;
"
clinking
with
a
change
of
keys
.
   
<EOS>
(
"
You
ca
n't
make
a
pitch
pipe
of
'em
,
Mr
Jasper
.
"
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Or
whether
the
name
comes
from
your
trade
.
 
<EOS>
How
stands
the
fact
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
weighs
the
three
keys
in
his
hand
,
lifts
his
head
from
his
idly
stooping
attitude
over
the
fire
,
and
delivers
the
keys
to
Durdles
with
an
ingenuous
and
friendly
face
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
stony
one
is
a
gruff
one
likewise
,
and
that
hazy
state
of
his
is
always
an
uncertain
state
,
highly
conscious
of
its
dignity
,
and
prone
to
take
offence
.
 
<EOS>
He
drops
his
two
keys
back
into
his
pocket
one
by
one
,
and
buttons
them
up
;
he
takes
his
dinner
-
bundle
from
the
chair
-
back
on
which
he
hung
it
when
he
came
in
;
he
distributes
the
weight
he
carries
,
by
tying
the
third
key
up
in
it
,
as
though
he
were
an
Ostrich
,
and
liked
to
dine
off
cold
iron
;
and
he
gets
out
of
the
room
,
deigning
no
word
of
answer
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
then
proposes
a
hit
at
backgammon
,
which
,
seasoned
with
his
own
improving
conversation
,
and
terminating
in
a
supper
of
cold
roast
beef
and
salad
,
beguiles
the
golden
evening
until
pretty
late
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
's
wisdom
being
,
in
its
delivery
to
mortals
,
rather
of
the
diffuse
than
the
epigrammatic
order
,
is
by
no
means
expended
even
then
;
but
his
visitor
intimates
that
he
will
come
back
for
more
of
the
precious
commodity
on
future
occasions
,
and
Mr
Sapsea
lets
him
off
for
the
present
,
to
ponder
on
the
instalment
he
carries
away
.
    
Chapter
5
.
<EOS>
Mr
Durdles
and
friend
 
John
Jasper
,
on
his
way
home
through
the
Close
,
is
brought
to
a
stand
-
still
by
the
spectacle
of
Stony
Durdles
,
dinner
-
bundle
and
all
,
leaning
his
back
against
the
iron
railing
of
the
burial
-
ground
enclosing
it
from
the
old
cloister
-
arches
;
and
a
hideous
small
boy
in
rags
flinging
stones
at
him
as
a
well
-
defined
mark
in
the
moonlight
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
stones
hit
him
,
and
sometimes
they
miss
him
,
but
Durdles
seems
indifferent
to
either
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
The
hideous
small
boy
,
on
the
contrary
,
whenever
he
hits
Durdles
,
blows
a
whistle
of
triumph
through
a
jagged
gap
,
convenient
for
the
purpose
,
in
the
front
of
his
mouth
,
where
half
his
teeth
are
wanting
;
and
whenever
he
misses
him
,
yelps
out
"
Mulled
agin
!
"
and
tries
to
atone
for
the
failure
by
taking
a
more
correct
and
vicious
aim
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
doing
to
the
man
?
"
<EOS>
demands
Jasper
,
stepping
out
into
the
moonlight
from
the
shade
.
   
<EOS>
"
Making
a
cock
-
shy
of
him
,
"
replies
the
hideous
small
boy
.
   
<EOS>
"
Give
me
those
stones
in
your
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
'll
give
'em
you
down
your
throat
,
if
you
come
a
-
ketching
hold
of
me
,
"
says
the
small
boy
,
shaking
himself
loose
,
and
backing
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
smash
your
eye
,
if
you
do
n't
look
out
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Baby
-
Devil
that
you
are
,
what
has
the
man
done
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
wo
n't
go
home
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
that
to
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
gives
me
a
'
apenny
to
pelt
him
home
if
I
ketches
him
out
too
late
,
"
says
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
chants
,
like
a
little
savage
,
half
stumbling
and
half
dancing
among
the
rags
and
laces
of
his
dilapidated
boots
:

<EOS>
---
with
a
comprehensive
sweep
on
the
last
word
,
and
one
more
delivery
at
Durdles
.
   
<EOS>
This
would
seem
to
be
a
poetical
note
of
preparation
,
agreed
upon
,
as
a
caution
to
Durdles
to
stand
clear
if
he
can
,
or
to
betake
himself
homeward
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
invites
the
boy
with
a
beck
of
his
head
to
follow
him
(
feeling
it
hopeless
to
drag
him
,
or
coax
him
)
,
and
crosses
to
the
iron
railing
where
the
Stony
(
and
stoned
)
<EOS>
One
is
profoundly
meditating
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
this
thing
,
this
child
?
"
asks
Jasper
,
at
a
loss
for
a
word
that
will
define
this
thing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Deputy

says
Durdles
,
with
a
nod
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is

Then
withdrawing
into

he

<EOS>
The
relations
between
Durdles
and
Deputy
are
of
a
capricious
kind
;
for
,
on
Durdles
's
turning
himself
about
with
the
slow
gravity
of
beery
suddenness
,
Deputy
makes
a
pretty
wide
circuit
into
the
road
and
stands
on
the
defensive
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
never
cried

Warning
before

says
Durdles
,
unexpectedly
reminded
of
,
or
imagining
,
an
injury
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
lie

I
did

"
says
Deputy
,
in
his
only
form
of
polite
contradiction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Own
brother

sir

"
observes
Durdles
,
turning
himself
about
again
,
and
as
unexpectedly
forgetting
his
offence
as
he
had
recalled
or
conceived
it
;
"
own
brother

Peter
the
Wild
Boy

<EOS>
But
I
gave

an

"
   
<EOS>
"
At
which
he
takes
aim

"
<EOS>
Mr

suggests
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
it
,
sir
,
"
returns
Durdles
,
quite
satisfied
;
"
at
which
he
takes
aim
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
him
in
hand
and
gave
him
an
object
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
he
before
?
 
<EOS>
A
destroyer
.
 
<EOS>
What
work
did
he
do
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
but
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
What
did
he
earn
by
it
?
 
<EOS>
Short
terms

<EOS>
Not

but
what
he
stoned
,
for
want
of
an
enlightened

<EOS>
I
put
that
enlightened
object
before
him
,
and
now
he
can
turn
his
honest
halfpenny
by
the
three
penn'orth
a

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder

"
   
<EOS>
"
He

Mr

<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
n't
know
what
this
scheme
of
mine
comes
to

"
pursues
Durdles
,
considering
about
it
with
the
same
sodden
gravity
;
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
may
precisely
call
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
a
sort

National

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
not

"
replies
Jasper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
not

"
assents
Durdles
;
"
then
we
wo
n't
try
to
give
it
a
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
still
keeps
behind
us
,
"
repeats
Jasper
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
;
"
is
he
to
follow
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
help
going
round
by
the
Travellers
'
Twopenny
,
if
we
go
the
short
way
,
which
is
the
back
way
,
"
Durdles
answers
,
"
and
we
'll
drop
him
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
they
go
on
;
<EOS>
Deputy
,
as
a
rear
rank
one
,
taking
open
order
,
and
invading
the
silence
of
the
hour
and
place
by
stoning
every
wall
,
post
,
pillar
,
and
other
inanimate
object
,
by
the
deserted
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anything
new
down
in
the
crypt
,
Durdles
?
"
asks
John
Jasper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Anything
old
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
mean

"
growls
Durdles
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
ai
n't
a
spot
for
novelty
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Any
new
discovery
on
your
part
,
I
meant
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
old
'
un
under
the
seventh
pillar
on
the
left
as
you
go
down
the
broken
steps
of
the
little
underground
chapel
as
formerly
was
;
I
make
him
out
(
so
fur
as
I
've
made
him
out
yet
)
to
be
one
of
them
old
'
<EOS>
uns
with
a
crook
.
 
<EOS>
To
judge
from
the
size
of
the
passages
in
the
walls
,
and
of
the
steps
and
doors
,
by
which
they
come
and
went
,
<EOS>
them
crooks
must
have
been
a
good
deal
in
the
way
of
the
old
'
uns
!
 
<EOS>
Two
on
'em
meeting
promiscuous
must
have
hitched
one
another
by
the
mitre
pretty
often

I
should
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Without
any
endeavour
to
correct
the
literality
of
this
opinion
,
Jasper
surveys
his
companion
---
covered
from
head
to
foot
with
old
mortar
,
lime
,
and
stone
grit
---
as
though
he
,
Jasper
,
were
getting
imbued
with
a
romantic
interest
in
his
weird
life
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
curious
existence
.
"
   
<EOS>
Without
furnishing
the
least
clue
to
the
question
,
whether
he
receives
this
as
a
compliment
or
as
quite
the
reverse
,
Durdles
gruffly
answers
:
 
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
another
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
inasmuch
as
my
lot
is
cast
in
the
same
old
earthy
,
chilly
,
never
-
changing
place
,
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
much
more
mystery
and
interest
in
your
connection
with
the
Cathedral
than
in
mine
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
beginning
to
have
some
idea
of
asking
you
to
take
me
on
as
a
sort
of
student
,
or
free
'
prentice
,
under
you
,
and
to
let
me
go
about
with
you
sometimes
,
and
see
some
of
these
odd
nooks
in
which
you
pass
your
days
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Stony
One
replies
,
in
a
general
way
,
"
All
right
.
 
<EOS>
Everybody
knows
where
to
find
Durdles
,
when
he
's
wanted
.
"
 
<EOS>
Which
,
if
not
strictly
true
,
is
approximately
so
,
if
taken
to
express
that
Durdles
may
always
be
found
in
a
state
of
vagabondage
somewhere
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
I
dwell
upon
most

says
Jasper
,
pursuing
his
subject
of
romantic
interest
,
"
is
the
remarkable
accuracy
with
which
you
would
seem

find
out
where

What
is
the

<EOS>
That
bundle

in

me
hold
it

<EOS>
Durdles
has
stopped
and
backed
a
little
(
Deputy
,
attentive
to
all
his
movements
,
immediately
skirmishing
into
the
road
)
,
and
was
looking
about
for
some
ledge
or
corner
to
place
his
bundle
on
,
when
thus
relieved
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
you

me
my

<EOS>
(
Here
he
strikes
the
pavement
,
and
the
attentive
Deputy
skirmishes
at
a
rather
wider
range
,
as
supposing
that
his

says
Durdles
,
drawing
out
his
two

foot
rule
(
Deputy
meanwhile
skirmishing
nearer
,
as
suspecting
that
Treasure

be
about
to
be
discovered
,
which
may
somehow
lead
to
his

enrichment

the
delicious

that

says
,
after
good
sounding
:

by

receiving
the

I
worked

Durdles
comes

<EOS>
returns
Deputy
,
having
caught
the
halfpenny
,
and
appearing
by
this
mystic
word
to
express
his
assent
to
the
arrangement
.
   
<EOS>
They
have
but
to
cross
what
was
once
the
vineyard
,
belonging
to
what
was
once
the
Monastery
,
to
come
into
the
narrow
back
lane
<EOS>
wherein
stands
the
crazy
wooden
house
of
two
low
stories
currently
known
as
the
Travellers
'
Twopenny
:
---
a
house
all
warped
and
distorted
,
like
the
morals
of
the
travellers
,
with
scant
remains
of
a
lattice
-
work
porch
over
the
door
,
and
also
of
a
rustic
fence
before
its
stamped
-
out
garden
;
by
reason
of
the
travellers
being
so
bound
to
the
premises
by
a
tender
sentiment
(
or
so
fond
of
having
a
fire
by
the
roadside
in
the
course
of
the
day
)
,
that
they
can
never
be
persuaded
or
threatened
into
departure
,
without
violently
possessing
themselves
of
some
wooden
forget
-
me
-
not
,
and
bearing
it
off
.
   
<EOS>
The
semblance
of
an
inn
is
attempted
to
be
given
to
this
wretched
place
by
fragments
of
conventional
red
curtaining
in
the
windows
,
which
rags
are
made
muddily
transparent
in
the
night
-
season
by
feeble
lights
of
rush
or
cotton
dip
burning
dully
in
the
close
air
of
the
inside
.
 
<EOS>
As
Durdles
and
Jasper
come
near
,
they
are
addressed
by
an
inscribed
paper
lantern
over
the
door
,
setting
forth
the
purport
of
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
also
addressed
by
some
half
-
dozen
other
hideous
small
boys
---
whether
twopenny
lodgers
or
followers
or
hangers
-
on
of
such
,
who
knows
!
---
who
,
as
if
attracted
by
some
carrion
-
scent
of
Deputy
in
the
air
,
start
into
the
moonlight
,
as
vultures
might
gather
in
the
desert
,
and
instantly
fall
to
stoning
him
and
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
you
young
brutes
,
"
cries
Jasper
angrily
,
"
and
let
us
go
by
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
remonstrance
being
received
with
yells
and
flying
stones
,
according
to
a
custom
of
late
years
comfortably
established
among
the
police
regulations
of
our
English
communities
,
where
Christians
are
stoned
on
all
sides
,
as
if
the
days
of
Saint
Stephen
were
revived
,
Durdles
remarks
of
the
young
savages
,
with
some
point
,
that
"
they
have
n't
got
an
object
,
"
and
leads
the
way
down
the
lane
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
the
lane
,
Jasper
,
hotly
enraged
,
checks
his
companion
and
looks
back
.
 
<EOS>
All
is
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Next
moment
,
a
stone
coming
rattling
at
his
hat
,
and
a
distant
yell
of
"
Wake
-
Cock
!
<EOS>
Warning
!
"
<EOS>
followed
by
a
crow
,
as
from
some
infernally
-
hatched
Chanticleer
,
apprising
him
under
whose
victorious
fire
he
stands
,
he
turns
the
corner
into
safety
,
and
takes
Durdles
home
:
 
Durdles
stumbling
among
the
litter
of
his
stony
yard
as
if
he
were
going
to
turn
head
foremost
into
one
of
the
unfinished
tombs
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
returns
by
another
way
to
his
gatehouse
,
and
entering
softly
with
his
key
,
finds
his
fire
still
burning
.
 
<EOS>
He
takes
from
a
locked
press
a
peculiar
-
looking
pipe
,
which
he
fills
---
but
not
with
tobacco
---
and
,
having
adjusted
the
contents
of
the
bowl
,
very
carefully
,
with
a
little
instrument
,
ascends
an
inner
staircase
of
only
a
few
steps
,
leading
to
two
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
is
his
own
sleeping
chamber
:
 
<EOS>
the
other
is
his
nephew

.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
light
in
each
.
   
<EOS>
His
nephew
lies
asleep
,
calm
and
untroubled
.
 
<EOS>
John
Jasper
stands
looking
down
upon
him
,
his
unlighted
pipe
in
his
hand
,
for
some
time
,
with
a
fixed
and
deep
attention
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
hushing
his
footsteps
,
he
passes
to
his
own
room
,
lights
his
pipe
,
and
delivers
himself
to
the
Spectres
it
invokes
at

The
Reverend
Septimus
Crisparkle
(
Septimus
,
because
six
little
brother
Crisparkles
before
him
went
out
,
one
by
one
,
as
they
were
born
,
like
six
weak
little
rushlights
,
as
they
were
lighted
)
,
having
broken
the
thin
morning
ice
near
Cloisterham
Weir
with
his
amiable
head
,
much
to
the
invigoration
of
his
frame
,
was
now
assisting
his
circulation
by
boxing
at
a
looking
-
glass
with
great
science
and
prowess
.
 
<EOS>
A
fresh
and
healthy
portrait
<EOS>
the
looking
-
glass
presented
of
the
Reverend
Septimus
,
feinting
and
dodging
with
the
utmost
artfulness
,
and
hitting
out
from
the
shoulder
with
the
utmost
straightness
,
while
his
radiant
features
teemed
with
innocence
,
and
soft
-
hearted
benevolence
beamed
from
his
boxing
-
gloves
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
breakfast
-
time
yet
,
for
Mrs
Crisparkle
---
mother
,
not
wife
of
the
Reverend
Septimus
---
was
only
just
down
,
and
waiting
for
the
urn
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Reverend
Septimus
left
off
at
this
very
moment
to
take
the
pretty
old
lady
's
entering
face
between
his
boxing
-
gloves
and
kiss
it
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
so
with
tenderness
,
the
Reverend
Septimus
turned
to
again
,
countering
with
his
left
,
and
putting
in
his
right
,
in
a
tremendous
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
every
morning
of
my
life
,
that
you
'll
do
it
at
last
,
Sept

"
remarked
the
old
lady
,
looking
on
;
"
and
so
you
will
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
what
,
Ma
dear

"
   
<EOS>
"
Break

Here

Ma

<EOS>
Look

"
<EOS>
In
a
concluding
round
of
great
severity
,
the
Reverend
Septimus
administered
and
escaped
all
sorts
of
punishment
,
and
wound
up
by
getting
the
old
lady
's
cap
into
Chancery
---
<EOS>
such
is
the
technical
term
used
in
scientific
circles
by
the
learned
in
the
Noble
Art
---
with
a
lightness
of
touch
that
hardly
stirred
the
lightest
lavender
or
cherry
riband
on
it
.
 
<EOS>
Magnanimously
releasing
the
defeated
,
just
in
time
to
get
his
gloves
into
a
drawer
and
feign
to
be
looking
out
of
window
in
a
contemplative
state
of
mind
when
a
servant
entered
,
the
Reverend
Septimus
then
gave
place
to
the
urn
and
other
preparations
for
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
These
completed
,
and
the
two
alone
again
,
it
was
pleasant
to
see
(
or
would
have
been
,
if
there
had
been
any
one
to
see
it
,
which
there
never
was
)
,
<EOS>
the
old
lady
standing
to
say
the
Lord
's
Prayer
aloud
,
and
her
son
,
Minor
Canon
nevertheless
,
standing
with
bent
head
to
hear
it
<EOS>
,
he
being
within
five
years
of
forty
:
 
much
as
he
had
stood
to
hear
the
same
words
from
the
same
lips
when
he
was
within
five
months
of

<EOS>
What
is
prettier
than
an
old
lady
---
except
a
young
lady
---
when
her
eyes
are
bright
,
when
her
figure
is
trim
and
compact
,
when
her
face
is
cheerful
and
calm
,
when
her
dress
is
as
the
dress
of
a
china
shepherdess
:
 
so
dainty
in
its
colours
,
so
individually
assorted
to
herself
,
so
neatly
moulded
on
her
?
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
prettier
,
thought
the
good
Minor
Canon
frequently
,
when
taking
his
seat
at
table
opposite
his
long
-
widowed
mother
.
 
<EOS>
Her
thought
at
such
times
may
be
condensed
into
the
two
words
that
oftenest
did
duty
together
in
all
her
conversations
:
 
"
My
Sept
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
a
good
pair
to
sit
breakfasting
together
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
For
Minor
Canon
Corner
was
a
quiet
place
in
the
shadow
of
the
Cathedral
,
which
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
,
the
echoing
footsteps
of
rare
passers
,
the
sound
of
the
Cathedral
bell
,
or
the
roll
of
the
Cathedral
organ
,
seemed
to
render
more
quiet
than
absolute
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Swaggering
fighting
men
had
had
their
centuries
of
ramping
and
raving
about
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
and
beaten
serfs
had
had
their
centuries
of
drudging
and
dying
there
,
and
powerful
monks
had
had
their
centuries
of
being
sometimes
useful
and
sometimes
harmful
there
,
and
behold
they
were
all
gone
out
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
and
so
much
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
one
of
the
highest
uses
of
their
ever
having
been
there
,
was
,
that
there
might
be
left
behind
,
that
blessed
air
of
tranquillity
which
pervaded
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
and
that
serenely
romantic
state
of
the
mind
---
productive
for
the
most
part
of
pity
and
forbearance
---
which
is
engendered
by
a
sorrowful
story
that
is
all
told
,
or
a
pathetic
play
that
is
played
out
.

were
the

they
sat
at

And
what

inquired
the

Canon
,
giving
proof
of
a
wholesome

vigorous
appetite

does
the

say

<EOS>
The
pretty
old
lady
,
after
reading
it
,
had
just
laid
it
down
upon
the
breakfast
-
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
She
handed
it
over
to
her
son
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
the
old
lady
was
exceedingly
proud
of
her
bright
eyes
being
so
clear
that
she
could
read
writing
without
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
Her
son
was
also
so
proud
of
the
circumstance
,
and
so
dutifully
bent
on
her
deriving
the
utmost
possible
gratification
from
it
,
that
he
had
invented
the
pretence
that
he
himself
could
NOT
read
writing
without
spectacles
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
he
now
assumed
a
pair
,
of
grave
and
prodigious
proportions
,
which
not
only
seriously
inconvenienced
his
nose
and
his
breakfast
,
but
seriously
impeded
his
perusal
of
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
he
had
the
eyes
of
a
microscope
and
a
telescope
combined
,
when
they
were
unassisted
.

"

the

folding

Of

In

said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Septimus
took
off
his
spectacles
,
that
he
might
see
her
face
,
as
he
exclaimed
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
should
he
write
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
me

bless

returned
the
old
lady
,
"
you
do
n't
see
the
context

<EOS>
Give
it
back
to
me
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Glad
to
get
his
spectacles
off
<EOS>
(
for
they
always
made
his
eyes
water
)
,
her
son
obeyed
:
 
<EOS>
murmuring
that
his
sight
for
reading
manuscript
got
worse
and
worse
daily
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
I
write
,
"
"
his
mother
went
on
,
reading
very
perspicuously
and
precisely
,
"
"
from
the
chair
,
to
which
I
shall
probably
be
confined
for
some
hours
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Septimus
looked
at
the
row
of
chairs
against
the
wall
,
with
a
half
-
protesting
and
half
-
appealing
countenance
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
We
have
,
"
"
the
old
lady
read
on
with
a
little
extra
emphasis
,
"
"
a
meeting
of
our
Convened
Chief
Composite
Committee
of
Central
and
District
Philanthropists
,
at
our
Head
Haven
as
above
;
and
it
is
their
unanimous
pleasure
that
I
take
the
chair
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
Septimus
breathed
more
freely
,
and
muttered
:
 
"
O
!
if
he
comes
to
THAT
,
let
him
,
"
   
"
"
Not
to
lose
a
day
's
post
,
I
take
the
opportunity
of
a
long
report
being
read
,
denouncing
a
public
miscreant
---
"
"
   
"
It
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
,
"
interposed
the
gentle
Minor
Canon
,
laying
down
his
knife
and
fork
to
rub
his
ear
in
a
vexed
manner
,
"
that
these
Philanthropists
are
always
denouncing
somebody
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
another
most
extraordinary
thing
that
they
are
always
so
violently
flush
of
miscreants
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
"
Denouncing
a
public
miscreant
---
"
"
---
the
old
lady
resumed
,
"
"
to
get
our
little
affair
of
business
off
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
with
my
two
wards
,
Neville
and
Helena
Landless
,
on
the
subject
of
their
defective
education
,
and
they
give
in
to
the
plan
proposed
;
as
I
should
have
taken
good
care
they
did
,
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
.
"
<EOS>
"
   
"
And
it
is
another
most
extraordinary
thing
,
"
remarked
the
Minor
Canon
in
the
same
tone
as
before
,
"
that
these
philanthropists
are
so
given
to
seizing
their
fellow
-
creatures
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
,
and
(
as
one
may
say
)
bumping
them
into
the
paths
of
peace
.
<EOS>
---
I
beg
your
pardon
,
<EOS>
Ma
dear
,
for
interrupting
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
"
Therefore
,
dear
Madam
,
you
will
please
prepare
your
son
,
the
Rev.
Mr
Septimus
,
to
expect
Neville
as
an
inmate
to
be
read
with
,
on
Monday
next
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
Helena
will
accompany
him
to
Cloisterham
,
to
take
up
her
quarters
at
the
Nuns
'
House
,
the
establishment
recommended
by
yourself
and
son
jointly
.
 
<EOS>
Please
likewise
to
prepare
for
her
reception
and
tuition
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
terms
in
both
cases
are
understood
to
be
exactly
as
stated
to
me
in
writing
by
yourself
,
when
I
opened
a
correspondence
with
you
on
this
subject
,
after
the
honour
of
being
introduced
to
you
at
your
sister
's
house
in
town
here
.
 
<EOS>
With
compliments
to
the
Rev.
 
Mr
Septimus
,
I
am
,
Dear
Madam
,
<EOS>
Your
affectionate
brother
(
In
Philanthropy
)
,
LUKE
HONEYTHUNDER
.
"
"
   
"
Well
,
Ma
,
"
said
Septimus
,
after
a
little
more
rubbing
of
his
ear
,
"
we
must
try
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
can
be
no
doubt
that
we
have
room
for
an
inmate
,
and
that
I
have
time
to
bestow
upon
him
,
and
inclination
too
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
confess
to
feeling
rather
glad
that
he
is
not
Mr
Honeythunder
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Though
that
seems
wretchedly
prejudiced
---
does
it
not
?
<EOS>
---
for
I
never
saw
him
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
a
large
man
,
Ma
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
call
him
a
large
man
,
my
dear
,
"
the
old
lady
replied
after
some
hesitation
,
"
but
that
his
voice
is
so
much
larger
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Than
himself
?
"
   
"
<EOS>
Than
anybody
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
"
said
Septimus
.
 
<EOS>
And
finished
his
breakfast
as
if
the
flavour
of
the
Superior
Family
Souchong
,
and
also
of
the
ham
and
toast
and
eggs
,
were
a
little
on
the

Mrs
Crisparkle
's
sister
,
another
piece
of
Dresden
china
,
and
matching
her
so
neatly
that
they
would
have
made
a
delightful
pair
of
ornaments
for
the
two
ends
of
any
capacious
old
-
fashioned
chimneypiece
,
and
by
right
should
never
have
been
seen
apart
,
was
the
childless
wife
of
a
clergyman
holding
Corporation
preferment
in
London
City
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Honeythunder
in
his
public
character
of
Professor
of
Philanthropy
had
come
to
know
Mrs
Crisparkle
during
the
last
re
-
matching
of
the
china
ornaments
(
in
other
words
during
her
last
annual
visit
to
her
sister
)
,
after
a
public
occasion
of
a
philanthropic
nature
,
when
certain
devoted
orphans
of
tender
years
had
been
glutted
with
plum
buns
,
and
plump
bumptiousness
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
all
the
antecedents
known
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
of
the
coming
pupils
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
,
Ma
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
after
thinking
the
matter
over
,
"
that
the
first
thing
to
be
done
,
is
,
to
put
these
young
people
as
much
at
their
ease
as
possible
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
disinterested
in
the
notion
,
because
we
can
not
be
at
our
ease
with
them
unless
they
are
at
their
ease
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Jasper
's
nephew
is
down
here
at
present
;
and
like
takes
to
like
,
and
youth
takes
to
youth
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
a
cordial
young
fellow
,
and
we
will
have
him
to
meet
the
brother
and
sister
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
three
.
 
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
think
of
asking
him
,
without
asking
Jasper
.
<EOS>
That
's
four
.
 
<EOS>
Add
Miss
Twinkleton
and
the
fairy
bride
that
is
to
be
,
and
<EOS>
that
's
six
.
 
<EOS>
Add
our
two
selves
,
and
that
's
eight
.
 
<EOS>
Would
eight
at
a
friendly
dinner
at
all
put
you
out
,
Ma
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nine
would
,
Sept
,
"
returned
the
old
lady
,
visibly
nervous
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Ma
,
I
particularise
eight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
exact
size
of
the
table
and
the
room
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
it
was
settled
that
way
:
 
and
when
Mr
Crisparkle
called
with
his
mother
upon
Miss
Twinkleton
,
to
arrange
for
the
reception
of
Miss
Helena
Landless
at
the
Nuns
'
House
,
the
two
other
invitations
having
reference
to
that
establishment
were
proffered
and
accepted
.
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
did
,
indeed
,
glance
at
the
globes
,
as
regretting
that
they
were
not
formed
to
be
taken
out
into
society
;
but
became
reconciled
to
leaving
them
behind
.
 
<EOS>
Instructions
were
then
despatched
to
the
Philanthropist
for
the
departure
and
arrival
,
in
good
time
for
dinner
,
of
Mr
Neville
and
Miss
Helena
;
and
stock
for
soup
became
fragrant
in
the
air
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
.
   
<EOS>
In
those
days
there
was
no
railway
to
Cloisterham
,
and
Mr
Sapsea
said
there
never
would
be
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
said
more
;
he
said
there
never
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
marvellous
to
consider
,
it
has
come
to
pass
,
in
these
days
,
that
Express
Trains
do
n't
think
Cloisterham
worth
stopping
at
,
but
yell
and
whirl
through
it
on
their
larger
errands
,
casting
the
dust
off
their
wheels
as
a
testimony
against
its
insignificance
.
 
<EOS>
Some
remote
fragment
of
Main
Line
to
somewhere
else
,
there
was
,
which
was
going
to
ruin
the
Money
Market
if
it
failed
,
and
Church
and
State
if
it
succeeded
,
and
(
of
course
)
,
the
Constitution
,
whether
or
no
;
but
even
that
had
already
so
unsettled
Cloisterham
traffic
,
that
the
traffic
,
deserting
the
high
road
,
came
sneaking
in
from
an
unprecedented
part
of
the
country
by
a
back
stable
-
way
,
for
many
years
labelled
at
the
corner
:
 
<EOS>
"
Beware
of
the
Dog
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
this
ignominious
avenue
of
approach
,
Mr
Crisparkle
repaired
,
awaiting
the
arrival
of
a
short
,
squat
omnibus
,
with
a
disproportionate
heap
of
luggage
on
the
roof
---
like
a
little
Elephant
with
infinitely
too
much
Castle
---
which
was
then
the
daily
service
between
Cloisterham
and
external
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
vehicle
lumbered
up
,
Mr
Crisparkle
could
hardly
see
anything
else
of
it
for
a
large
outside
passenger
seated
on
the
box
,
with
his
elbows
squared
,
and
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
compressing
the
driver
into
a
most
uncomfortably
small
compass
,
and
glowering
about
him
with
a
strongly
-
marked
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Cloisterham
?
"
demanded
the
passenger
,
in
a
tremendous
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
,
"
replied
the
driver
,
rubbing
himself
as
if
he
ached
,
after
throwing
the
reins
to
the
ostler
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
I
never
was
so
glad
to
see
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tell
your
master
to
make
his
box
-
seat
wider
,
then
,
"
returned
the
passenger
.
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
is
morally
bound
---
and
ought
to
be
legally
,
under
ruinous
penalties
---
to
provide
for
the
comfort
of
his
fellow
-
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
driver
instituted
,
with
the
palms
of
his
hands
,
a
superficial
perquisition
into
the
state
of
his
skeleton
;
which
seemed
to
make
him
anxious
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
I
sat
upon
you
?
"
asked
the
passenger
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
"
said
the
driver
,
as
if
he
did
n't
like
it
at
all
.
   
<EOS>
"
Take
that
card
,
my
friend
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
wo
n't
deprive
you
on
it
,
"
returned
the
driver
,
casting
his
eyes
over
it
with
no
great
favour
,
without
taking
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
good
of
it
to
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Be
a
Member
of
that
Society
,
"
said
the
passenger
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
shall
I
get
by
it
?
"
asked
the
driver
.
   
<EOS>
"
Brotherhood
,
"
returned
the
passenger
,
in
a
ferocious
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thankee
,
"
said
the
driver
,
very
deliberately
,
as
he
got
down
;
"
my
mother
was
contented
with
myself
,
and
so
am
I.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
no
brothers
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
have
them
,
"
replied
the
passenger
,
also
descending
,
"
whether
you
like
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
your
brother
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
say
!
"
<EOS>
expostulated
the
driver
,
becoming
more
chafed
in
temper
,
"
not
too
fur
!
 
<EOS>
The
worm
WILL
,
when
---
"
   
<EOS>
But
here
,
Mr
Crisparkle
interposed
,
remonstrating
aside
,
in
a
friendly
voice
:
 
"
Joe
,
Joe
,
Joe
!
<EOS>
do
n't
forget
yourself
,
Joe
,
my
good
fellow

"
<EOS>
and
then
,
when
Joe
peaceably
touched
his
hat
,
accosting
the
passenger
with
:
 
"
Mr
Honeythunder
?
"
   
"
That
is
my
name
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Crisparkle

"
   
<EOS>
"
Reverend
Mr
Septimus
?
 
<EOS>
Glad
to
see
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
and
Helena
are
inside
.
 
<EOS>
Having
a
little
succumbed
of
late
,
under
the
pressure
of
my
public
labours
,
I
thought
I
would
take
a
mouthful
of
fresh
air
,
and
come
down
with
them
,
and
return
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
So
you
are
the
Reverend
Mr
Septimus
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
surveying
him
on
the
whole
with
disappointment
,
and
twisting
a
double
eyeglass
by
its
ribbon
,
as
if
he
were
roasting
it
,
but
not
otherwise
using
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hah
!
 
<EOS>
I
expected
to
see
you
older
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will

was
the
good
-
humoured
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
Eh
?
"
demanded
Mr
Honeythunder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
a
poor
little
joke
.
 
<EOS>
Not
worth
repeating
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Joke
?
 
<EOS>
Ay
;
I
never
see
a
joke
,
"
Mr
Honeythunder
frowningly
retorted
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
joke
is
wasted
upon
me
,
sir

<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
 
<EOS>
Helena
and
Neville
,
come
here
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
has
come
down
to
meet
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
An
unusually
handsome
lithe
young
fellow
,
and
an
unusually
handsome
lithe
girl
;
much
alike
;
both
very
dark
,
and
very
rich
in
colour
;
she
of
almost
the
gipsy
type
;
something
untamed
about
them
both
;
a
certain
air
upon
them
of
hunter
and
huntress
;
yet
withal
a
certain
air
of
being
the
objects
of
the
chase
,
rather
than
the
followers
.
<EOS>
Slender
,
supple
,
quick
of
eye
and
limb
;
half
shy
,
half
defiant
;
fierce
of
look
;
an
indefinable
kind
of
pause
coming
and
going
on
their
whole
expression
,
both
of
face
and
form
,
which
might
be
equally
likened
to
the
pause
before
a
crouch
or
a
bound
.
 
<EOS>
The
rough
mental
notes
made
in
the
first
five
minutes
by
Mr
Crisparkle
would
have
read
thus
,
VERBATIM
.
   
<EOS>
He
invited
Mr
Honeythunder
to
dinner
,
with
a
troubled
mind
(
for
the
discomfiture
of
the
dear
old
china
shepherdess
lay
heavy
on
it
)
,
and
gave
his
arm
to
Helena
Landless
.
 
<EOS>
Both
she
and
her
brother
,
as
they
walked
all
together
through
the
ancient
streets
,
took
great
delight
in
what
he
pointed
out
of
the
Cathedral
and
the
Monastery
ruin
,
and
wondered
---
<EOS>
so
his
notes
ran
on
---
much
as
if
they
were
beautiful
barbaric
captives
brought
from
some
wild
tropical
dominion
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Honeythunder
walked
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
shouldering
the
natives
out
of
his
way
,
and
loudly
developing
a
scheme
he
had
,
for
making
a
raid
on
all
the
unemployed
persons
in
the
United
Kingdom
,
laying
them
every
one
by
the
heels
in
jail
,
and
forcing
them
,
on
pain
of
prompt
extermination
,
to
become
philanthropists
.
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Crisparkle
had
need
of
her
own
share
of
philanthropy
when
she
beheld
this
very
large
and
very
loud
excrescence
on
the
little
party
.
 
<EOS>
Always
something
in
the
nature
of
a
Boil
upon
the
face
of
society
,
Mr
Honeythunder
expanded
into
an
inflammatory
Wen
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
was
not
literally
true
,
as
was
facetiously
charged
against
him
by
public
unbelievers
,
that
he
called
aloud
to
his
fellow
-
creatures
:
 
<EOS>
"
Curse
your
souls
and
bodies
,
come
here
and
be
blessed
!
"
<EOS>
still
his
philanthropy
was
of
that
gunpowderous
sort
that
the
difference
between
it
and
animosity
was
hard
to
determine
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
to
abolish
military
force
,
but
you
were
first
to
bring
all
commanding
officers
who
had
done
their
duty
,
to
trial
by
court
-
martial
for
that
offence
,
and
shoot
them
.
<EOS>
You
were
to
abolish
war
,
but
were
to
make
converts
by
making
war
upon
them
,
and
charging
them
with
loving
war
as
the
apple
of
their
eye
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
to
have
no
capital
punishment
,
but
were
first
to
sweep
off
the
face
of
the
earth
all
legislators
,
jurists
,
and
judges
,
who
were
of
the
contrary
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
to
have
universal
concord
,
and
were
to
get
it
by
eliminating
all
the
people
who
would
n't
,
or
conscientiously
could
n't
,
be
concordant
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
to
love
your
brother
as
yourself
,
but
after
an
indefinite
interval
of
maligning
him
(
very
much
as
if
you
hated
him
)
,
and
calling
him
all
manner
of
names
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
things
,
you
were
to
do
nothing
in
private
,
or
on
your
own
account
.
 
<EOS>
You
were
to
go
to
the
offices
of
the
Haven
of
Philanthropy
,
and
put
your
name
down
as
a
Member
and
a
Professing
Philanthropist
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
you
were
to
pay
up
your
subscription
,
get
your
card
of
membership
and
your
riband
and
medal
,
and
were
evermore
to
live
upon
a
platform
,
and
evermore
to
say
what
Mr
Honeythunder
said
,
and
what
the
Treasurer
said
,
and
what
the
sub
-
Treasurer
said
,
and
what
the
Committee
said
,
and
what
the
sub
-
Committee
said
,
and
what
the
Secretary
said
,
and
what
the
Vice
-
Secretary
said
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
was
usually
said
in
the
unanimously
-
carried
resolution
under
hand
and
seal
,
to
the
effect
:
 
"
That
this
assembled
Body
of
Professing
Philanthropists
views
,
with
indignant
scorn
and
contempt
,
not
unmixed
with
utter
detestation
and
loathing
abhorrence
"
---
in
short
,
the
baseness
of
all
those
who
do
not
belong
to
it
,
and
pledges
itself
to
make
as
many
obnoxious
statements
as
possible
about
them
,
without
being
at
all
particular
as
to
facts
.
   
<EOS>
The
dinner
was
a
most
doleful
breakdown
.
 
<EOS>
The
philanthropist
deranged
the
symmetry
of
the
table
,
sat
himself
in
the
way
of
the
waiting
,
blocked
up
the
thoroughfare
,
and
drove
Mr
Tope
(
who
assisted
the
parlour
-
maid
)
to
the
verge
of
distraction
by
passing
plates
and
dishes
on
,
over
his
own
head
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
could
talk
to
anybody
,
because
he
held
forth
to
everybody
at
once
,
as
if
the
company
had
no
individual
existence
,
but
were
a
Meeting
.
 
<EOS>
He
impounded
the
Reverend
Mr
Septimus
,
as
an
official
personage
to
be
addressed
,
or
kind
of
human
peg
to
hang
his
oratorical
hat
on
,
and
fell
into
the
exasperating
habit
,
common
among
such
orators
,
of
impersonating
him
as
a
wicked
and
weak
opponent
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
he
would
ask
:
 
"
And
will
you
,
sir
,
now
stultify
yourself
by
telling
me
"
---
and
so
forth
,
when
the
innocent
man
had
not
opened
his
lips
,
nor
meant
to
open
them
.
 
<EOS>
Or
he
would
say
:
 
<EOS>
"
Now
see
,
sir
,
to
what
a
position
you
are
reduced
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
leave
you
no
escape
.
 
<EOS>
After
exhausting
all
the
resources
of
fraud
and
falsehood
,
during
years
upon
years
;
after
exhibiting
a
combination
of
dastardly
meanness
with
ensanguined
daring
,
such
as
the
world
has
not
often
witnessed
;
you
have
now
the
hypocrisy
to
bend
the
knee
before
the
most
degraded
of
mankind
,
and
to
sue
and
whine
and
howl
for
mercy
!
"
<EOS>
Whereat
the
unfortunate
Minor
Canon
would
look
,
in
part
indignant
and
in
part
perplexed
;
while
his
worthy
mother
sat
bridling
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
and
the
remainder
of
the
party
lapsed
into
a
sort
of
gelatinous
state
,
in
which
there
was
no
flavour
or
solidity
,
and
very
little
resistance
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
gush
of
philanthropy
that
burst
forth
when
the
departure
of
Mr
Honeythunder
began
to
impend
,
must
have
been
highly
gratifying
to
the
feelings
of
that
distinguished
man
.
 
<EOS>
His
coffee
was
produced
,
by
the
special
activity
of
Mr
Tope
,
a
full
hour
before
he
wanted
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
sat
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
for
about
the
same
period
,
lest
he
should
overstay
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
four
young
people
were
unanimous
in
believing
that
the
Cathedral
clock
struck
three
-
quarters
,
when
it
actually
struck
but
one
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
estimated
the
distance
to
the
omnibus
at
five
-
and
-
twenty
minutes
'
walk
,
when
it
was
really
five
.
 
<EOS>
The
affectionate
kindness
of
the
whole
circle
hustled
him
into
his
greatcoat
,
and
shoved
him
out
into
the
moonlight
,
as
if
he
were
a
fugitive
traitor
with
whom
they
sympathised
,
and
a
troop
of
horse
were
at
the
back
door
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
and
his
new
charge
,
who
took
him
to
the
omnibus
,
were
so
fervent
in
their
apprehensions
of
his
catching
cold
,
that
they
shut
him
up
in
it
instantly
and
left
him
,
with
still
half
-
an
-
hour
to
spare
.

More
confidences
than
one
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
very
little
of
that
gentleman
,
sir
,
"
said
Neville
to
the
Minor
Canon
as
they
turned
back
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
very
little
of
your
guardian
?
"
the
Minor
Canon
repeated
.
   
<EOS>
"
Almost
nothing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
came
he
---
"
   
"
To
BE
my
guardian
?
 
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
know
that
we
come
(
my
sister
and
I
)
from
Ceylon
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
no
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
at
that
.
 
<EOS>
We
lived
with
a
stepfather
there
.
 
<EOS>
Our
mother
died
there
,
when
we
were
little
children
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
had
a
wretched
existence
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
him
our
guardian
,
and
he
was
a
miserly
wretch
who
grudged
us
food
to
eat
,
and
clothes
to
wear
.
 
<EOS>
At
his
death
,
he
passed
us
over
to
this
man
;
for
no
better
reason
that
I
know
of
,
than
his
being
a
friend
or
connexion
of
his
,
whose
name
was
always
in
print
and
catching
his
attention
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
was
lately
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
lately
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
This
stepfather
of
ours
was
a
cruel
brute
as
well
as
a
grinding
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
<EOS>
well
he
died
when
he
did
,
or
I
might
have
killed
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
stopped
short
in
the
moonlight
and
looked
at
his
hopeful
pupil
in
consternation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
surprise
you
,
sir
?
"
he
said
,
with
a
quick
change
to
a
submissive
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
shock
me
;
unspeakably
shock
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
pupil
hung
his
head
for
a
little
while
,
as
they
walked
on
,
and
then
said
:
 
"
You
never
saw
him
beat
your
sister
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
beat
mine
,
more
than
once
or
twice
,
and
I
never
forgot
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
not
even
a
beloved
and
beautiful
sister
's
tears
under
dastardly
ill
-
usage
;
"
he
became
less
severe
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
as
his
indignation
rose
;
"
could
justify
those
horrible
expressions
that
you
used
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
I
used
them
,
and
especially
to
you
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
to
recall
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
permit
me
to
set
you
right
on
one
point
.
 
<EOS>
You
spoke
of
my
sister
's
tears
.
 
<EOS>
My
sister
would
have
let
him
tear
her
to
pieces
,
before
she
would
have
let
him
believe
that
he
could
make
her
shed
a
tear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
reviewed
those
mental
notes
of
his
,
and
was
neither
at
all
surprised
to
hear
it
,
nor
at
all
disposed
to
question
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
will
think
it
strange
,
sir
,
"
---
this
was
said
in
a
hesitating
voice
---
"
that
I
should
so
soon
ask
you
to
allow
me
to
confide
in
you
,
and
to
have
the
kindness
to
hear
a
word
or
two
from
me
in
my
defence
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Defence
?
"
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
repeated
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
on
your
defence
,
Mr
Neville
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
am
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
I
know
I
should
be
,
if
you
were
better
acquainted
with
my
character
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr
Neville
,
"
was
the
rejoinder
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
if
you
leave
me
to
find
it
out
?
"
   
"
Since
it
is
your
pleasure
,
sir
,
"
answered
the
young
man
,
with
a
quick
change
in
his
manner
to
sullen
disappointment
:
 
"
since
it
is
your
pleasure
to
check
me
in
my
impulse
,
I
must
submit
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
the
tone
of
this
short
speech
which
made
the
conscientious
man
to
whom
it
was
addressed
uneasy
.
 
<EOS>
It
hinted
to
him
that
he
might
,
without
meaning
it
,
turn
aside
a
trustfulness
beneficial
to
a
mis
-
shapen
young
mind
and
perhaps
to
his
own
power
of
directing
and
improving
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
within
sight
of
the
lights
in
his
windows
,
and
he
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
turn
back
and
take
a
turn
or
two
up
and
down
,
Mr
Neville
,
or
you
may
not
have
time
to
finish
what
you
wish
to
say
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
hasty
in
thinking
that
I
mean
to
check
you
.
 
<EOS>
Quite
the
contrary
.
 
<EOS>
I
invite
your
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
invited
it
,
sir
,
without
knowing
it
,
ever
since
I
came
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
"
ever
since
,
"
as
if
I
had
been
here
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
we
came
here
(
my
sister
and
I
)
to
quarrel
with
you
,
and
affront
you
,
and
break
away
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
?
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
at
a
dead
loss
for
anything
else
to
say
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
we
could
not
know
what
you
were
beforehand
,
sir
;
could
we
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Clearly
not
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
having
liked
no
one
else
with
whom
we
have
ever
been
brought
into
contact
,
we
had
made
up
our
minds
not
to
like
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Really
?
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
we
do
like
you
,
sir
,
and
we
see
an
unmistakable
difference
between
your
house
and
your
reception
of
us
,
and
anything
else
we
have
ever
known
.
 
<EOS>
This
---
and
my
happening
to
be
alone
with
you
---
and
everything
around
us
seeming
so
quiet
and
peaceful
after
Mr
Honeythunder
's
departure
---
and
Cloisterham
being
so
old
and
grave
and
beautiful
,
with
the
moon
shining
on
it
<EOS>
---
these
things
inclined
me
to
open
my
heart
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
quite
understand
,
Mr
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
is
salutary
to
listen
to
such
influences
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
describing
my
own
imperfections
,
sir
,
I
must
ask
you
not
to
suppose
that
I
am
describing
my
sister
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
has
come
out
of
the
disadvantages
of
our
miserable
life
,
as
much
better
than
I
am
,
as
that
Cathedral
tower
is
higher
than
those
chimneys
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
in
his
own
breast
was
not
so
sure
of
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
,
sir
,
from
my
earliest
remembrance
,
to
suppress
a
deadly
and
bitter
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
made
me
secret
and
revengeful
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
always
tyrannically
held
down
by
the
strong
hand
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
driven
me
,
in
my
weakness
,
to
the
resource
of
being
false
and
mean
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
stinted
of
education
,
liberty
,
money
,
dress
,
the
very
necessaries
of
life
,
the
commonest
pleasures
of
childhood
,
the
commonest
possessions
of
youth
.
 
<EOS>
This
has
caused
me
to
be
utterly
wanting
in
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
emotions
,
or
remembrances
,
or
good
instincts
---
I
have
not
even
a
name
for
the
thing
,
you
see
!
<EOS>
---
that
you
have
had
to
work
upon
in
other
young
men
to
whom
you
have
been
accustomed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
evidently
true
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
encouraging
,
"
thought
Mr
Crisparkle
as
they
turned
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
to
finish
with
,
sir
:
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
brought
up
among
abject
and
servile
dependents
,
of
an
inferior
race
,
and
I
may
easily
have
contracted
some
affinity
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
I
do
n't
know
but
that
it
may
be
a
drop
of
what
is
tigerish
in
their
blood
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
in
the
case
of
that
remark
just
now
,
"
thought
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
a
last
word
of
reference
to
my
sister
,
sir
(
we
are
twin
children
)
,
you
ought
to
know
,
to
her
honour
,
that
nothing
in
our
misery
ever
subdued
her
,
though
it
often
cowed
me
.
 
<EOS>
When
we
ran
away
from
it
(
we
ran
away
four
times
in
six
years
,
to
be
soon
brought
back
and
cruelly
punished
)
,
the
flight
was
always
of
her
planning
and
leading
.
 
<EOS>
Each
time
she
dressed
as
a
boy
,
and
showed
the
daring
of
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
<EOS>
we
were
seven
years
old
when
we
first
decamped
;
but
I
remember
,
when
I
lost
the
pocket
-
knife
with
which
she
was
to
have
cut
her
hair
short
,
how
desperately
she
tried
to
tear
it
out
,
or
bite
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
further
to
say
,
sir
,
except
that
I
hope
you
will
bear
with
me
and
make
allowance
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
that
,
Mr
Neville
,
you
may
be
sure
,
"
returned
the
Minor
Canon
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
preach
more
than
I
can
help
,
and
I
will
not
repay
your
confidence
with
a
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
entreat
you
to
bear
in
mind
,
very
seriously
and
steadily
,
that
if
I
am
to
do
you
any
good
,
it
can
only
be
with
your
own
assistance
;
and
that
you
can
only
render
that
,
efficiently
,
by
seeking
aid
from
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
do
my
part
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
,
Mr
Neville
,
I
will
try
to
do
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Here
is
my
hand
on
it
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
our
endeavours
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
now
standing
at
his
house
-
door
,
and
a
cheerful
sound
of
voices
and
laughter
was
heard
within
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
take
one
more
turn
before
going
in
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
for
I
want
to
ask
you
a
question
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
said
you
were
in
a
changed
mind
concerning
me
,
you
spoke
,
not
only
for
yourself
,
but
for
your
sister
too
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
I
did
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Mr
Neville
,
but
I
think
you
have
had
no
opportunity
of
communicating
with
your
sister
,
since
I
met
you
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Honeythunder
was
very
eloquent
;
but
perhaps
I
may
venture
to
say
,
without
ill
-
nature
,
that
he
rather
monopolised
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
May
you
not
have
answered
for
your
sister
without
sufficient
warrant
?
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
shook
his
head
with
a
proud
smile
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
yet
,
what
a
complete
understanding
can
exist
between
my
sister
and
me
,
though
no
spoken
word
---
perhaps
hardly
as
much
as
a
look
---
may
have
passed
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
She
not
only
feels
as
I
have
described
,
but
she
very
well
knows
that
I
am
taking
this
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
,
both
for
her
and
for
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
looked
in
his
face
,
with
some
incredulity
;
but
his
face
expressed
such
absolute
and
firm
conviction
of
the
truth
of
what
he
said
,
that
Mr
Crisparkle
looked
at
the
pavement
,
and
mused
,
until
they
came
to
his
door
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
for
one
more
turn
,
sir
,
this
time
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
with
a
rather
heightened
colour
rising
in
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
for
Mr
Honeythunder
's
---
I
think
you
called
it
eloquence
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
(
somewhat
slyly
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
<EOS>
yes
,
I
called
it
eloquence
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
But
for
Mr
Honeythunder
's
eloquence
,
I
might
have
had
no
need
to
ask
you
what
I
am
going
to
ask
you
.
 
<EOS>
This
Mr
Edwin
Drood
,
sir
:
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
's
the
name
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
correct
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
D
-
r
-
double
o
-
d
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Does
he
---
or
did
he
---
read
with
you
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
Mr
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
He
comes
here
visiting
his
relation
,
Mr
Jasper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
Miss
Bud
his
relation
too
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
(
"
Now
,
why
should
he
ask
that
,
with
sudden
superciliousness
?
"
thought
Mr
Crisparkle
.
)
 
<EOS>
Then
he
explained
,
aloud
,
what
he
knew
of
the
little
story
of
their
betrothal
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
THAT
'S
it
<EOS>
,
is
it
?
"
said
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
understand
his
air
of
proprietorship
now
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
said
so
evidently
to
himself
,
or
to
anybody
rather
than
Mr
Crisparkle
,
that
the
latter
instinctively
felt
as
if
to
notice
it
would
be
almost
tantamount
to
noticing
a
passage
in
a
letter
which
he
had
read
by
chance
over
the
writer
's
shoulder
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
they
re
-
entered
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
was
seated
at
the
piano
as
they
came
into
his
drawing
-
room
,
and
was
accompanying
Miss
Rosebud
while
she
sang
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
consequence
of
his
playing
the
accompaniment
without
notes
,
and
of
her
being
a
heedless
little
creature
,
very
apt
to
go
wrong
,
that
he
followed
her
lips
most
attentively
,
with
his
eyes
as
well
as
hands
;
carefully
and
softly
hinting
the
key
-
note
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Standing
with
an
arm
drawn
round
her
,
but
with
a
face
far
more
intent
on
Mr
Jasper
than
on
her
singing
,
stood
Helena
,
between
whom
and
her
brother
an
instantaneous
recognition
passed
,
in
which
Mr
Crisparkle
saw
,
or
thought
he
saw
,
the
understanding
that
had
been
spoken
of
,
flash
out
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
then
took
his
admiring
station
,
leaning
against
the
piano
,
opposite
the
singer
;
Mr
Crisparkle
sat
down
by
the
china
shepherdess
;
Edwin
Drood
gallantly
furled
and
unfurled
Miss
Twinkleton
's
fan
;
and
that
lady
passively
claimed
that
sort
of
exhibitor
's
proprietorship
in
the
accomplishment
on
view
,
which
Mr
Tope
,
the
Verger
,
daily
claimed
in
the
Cathedral
service
.
   
<EOS>
The
song
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sorrowful
strain
of
parting
,
and
the
fresh
young
voice
was
very
plaintive
and
tender
.
 
<EOS>
As
Jasper
watched
the
pretty
lips
,
and
ever
and
again
hinted
the
one
note
,
as
though
it
were
a
low
whisper
from
himself
,
the
voice
became
less
steady
,
until
all
at
once
the
singer
broke
into
a
burst
of
tears
,
and
shrieked
out
,
with
her
hands
over
her
eyes
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
bear
this
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
frightened
!
 
<EOS>
Take
me
away
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
one
swift
turn
of
her
lithe
figures
<EOS>
Helena
laid
the
little
beauty
on
a
sofa
,
as
if
she
had
never
caught
her
up
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
on
one
knee
beside
her
,
and
with
one
hand
upon
her
rosy
mouth
,
while
with
the
other
she
appealed
to
all
the
rest
,
Helena
said
to
them
:
 
"
It
's
nothing
;
it
's
all
over
;
do
n't
speak
to
her
for
one
minute
,
and
she
is
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
's
hands
had
,
in
the
same
instant
,
lifted
themselves
from
the
keys
,
and
were
now
poised
above
them
,
as
though
he
waited
to
resume
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
attitude
he
yet
sat
quiet
:
 
not
even
looking
round
,
when
all
the
rest
had
changed
their
places
and
were
reassuring
one
another
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pussy
's
not
used
to
an
audience
;
that
's
the
fact
,
"
said
Edwin
Drood
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
got
nervous
,
and
could
n't
hold
out
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
Jack
,
you
are
such
a
conscientious
master
,
and
require
so
much
,
that
I
believe
you
make
her
afraid
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
wonder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
wonder
,
"
repeated
Helena
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
Jack
,
you
hear
!
 
<EOS>
You
would
be
afraid
of
him
,
under
similar
circumstances
,
would
n't
you
,
Miss
Landless
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
under
any
circumstances
,
"
returned
Helena
.
   
<EOS>
Jasper
brought
down
his
hands
,
looked
over
his
shoulder
,
and
begged
to
thank
Miss
Landless
for
her
vindication
of
his
character
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
fell
to
dumbly
playing
,
without
striking
the
notes
,
while
his
little
pupil
was
taken
to
an
open
window
for
air
,
and
was
otherwise
petted
and
restored
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
brought
back
,
his
place
was
empty
.
 
<EOS>
"
Jack
's
gone
,
Pussy
,
"
Edwin
told
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
more
than
half
afraid
he
did
n't
like
to
be
charged
with
being
the
Monster
who
had
frightened
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
she
answered
never
a
word
,
and
shivered
,
as
if
they
had
made
her
a
little
too
cold
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
now
opining
that
indeed
these
were
late
hours
,
Mrs
Crisparkle
,
for
finding
ourselves
outside
the
walls
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
that
we
who
undertook
the
formation
of
the
future
wives
and
mothers
of
England
(
the
last
words
in
a
lower
voice
,
as
requiring
to
be
communicated
in
confidence
)
were
really
bound
(
voice
coming
up
again
)
to
set
a
better
example
than
one
of
rakish
habits
,
wrappers
were
put
in
requisition
,
and
the
two
young
cavaliers
volunteered
to
see
the
ladies
home
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
soon
done
,
and
the
gate
of
the
Nuns
'
House
closed
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
The
boarders
had
retired
,
and
only
Mrs
Tisher
in
solitary
vigil
awaited
the
new
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bedroom
being
within
Rosa
's
,
very
little
introduction
or
explanation
was
necessary
,
before
she
was
placed
in
charge
of
her
new
friend
,
and
left
for
the
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
blessed
relief
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
dreading
all
day
,
that
I
should
be
brought
to
bay
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
are
not
many
of
us
,
"
returned
Rosa
,
"
and
we
are
good
-
natured
girls
;
at
least
the
others
are
;
I
can
answer
for
them
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
answer
for
you
,
"
laughed
Helena
,
searching
the
lovely
little
face
with
her
dark
,
fiery
eyes
,
and
tenderly
caressing
the
small
figure
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
a
friend
to
me
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
my
being
a
friend
to
you
seems
too
absurd
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
I
am
such
a
mite
of
a
thing
,
and
you
are
so
womanly
and
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
You
seem
to
have
resolution
and
power
enough
to
crush
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
shrink
into
nothing
by
the
side
of
your
presence
even
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
neglected
creature
,
my
dear
,
unacquainted
with
all
accomplishments
,
sensitively
conscious
that
I
have
everything
to
learn
,
and
deeply
ashamed
to
own
my
ignorance
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
you
acknowledge
everything
to
me
!
"
said
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
pretty
one
,
can
I
help
it
?
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
fascination
in
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
is
there
though
?
"
<EOS>
pouted
Rosa
,
half
in
jest
and
half
in
earnest
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
a
pity
Master
Eddy
does
n't
feel
it
more
!
"
   
<EOS>
Of
course
her
relations
towards
that
young
gentleman
had
been
already
imparted
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
surely
he
must
love
you
with
all
his
heart
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Helena
,
with
an
earnestness
that
threatened
to
blaze
into
ferocity
if
he
did
n't
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
?
 
<EOS>
O
,
well
,
I
suppose
he
does
,
"
said
Rosa
,
pouting
again
;
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
I
have
no
right
to
say
he
does
n't
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
's
my
fault
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
am
not
as
nice
to
him
as
I
ought
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
IS
so
ridiculous
!
"
   
<EOS>
Helena
's
eyes
demanded
what
was
.
   
<EOS>
"
WE
are
,
"
said
Rosa
,
answering
as
if
she
had
spoken
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
are
such
a
ridiculous
couple
.
 
<EOS>
And
we
are
always
quarrelling
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
we
both
know
we
are
ridiculous
,
my
dear
!
"
 
<EOS>
Rosa
gave
that
answer
as
if
it
were
the
most
conclusive
answer
in
the
world
.
   
<EOS>
Helena
's
masterful
look
was
intent
upon
her
face
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
she
impulsively
put
out
both
her
hands
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
You
will
be
my
friend
and
help
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
my
dear
,
I
will
,
"
replied
Rosa
,
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
childishness
that
went
straight
and
true
to
her
heart
;
"
I
will
be
as
good
a
friend
as
such
a
mite
of
a
thing
can
be
to
such
a
noble
creature
as
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
be
a
friend
to
me
,
please
;
I
do
n't
understand
myself
:
 
<EOS>
and
I
want
a
friend
who
can
understand
me
,
very
much
indeed
.

Landless
kissed
her
,
and
retaining
both
her
hands
<EOS>
said
:
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Mr
Jasper
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
turned
aside
her
head
in
answering
:
 
"
Eddy
's
uncle
,
and
my
music
-
master
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
not
love
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ugh
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
put
her
hands
up
to
her
face
,
and
shook
with
fear
or
horror
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
that
he
loves
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
,
do
n't
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosa
,
dropping
on
her
knees
,
and
clinging
to
her
new
resource
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
of
it
!
 
<EOS>
He
terrifies
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
haunts
my
thoughts
,
like
a
dreadful
ghost
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
that
I
am
never
safe
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
he
could
pass
in
through
the
wall
when
he
is
spoken
of
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
actually
did
look
round
,
as
if
she
dreaded
to
see
him
standing
in
the
shadow
behind
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Try
to
tell
me
more
about
it
,
darling
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
will
,
I
will
.
 
<EOS>
Because
you
are
so
strong
.
 
<EOS>
But
hold
me
the
while
,
and
stay
with
me
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
child
!
 
<EOS>
You
speak
as
if
he
had
threatened
you
in
some
dark
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
never
spoken
to
me
about
---
that
.
 
<EOS>
Never
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
has
he
done
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
made
a
slave
of
me
with
his
looks
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
forced
me
to
understand
him
,
without
his
saying
a
word
;
and
he
has
forced
me
to
keep
silence
,
without
his
uttering
a
threat
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
play
,
he
never
moves
his
eyes
from
my
hands
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
sing
,
he
never
moves
his
eyes
from
my
lips
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
corrects
me
,
and
strikes
a
note
,
or
a
chord
,
or
plays
a
passage
,
he
himself
is
in
the
sounds
,
whispering
that
he
pursues
me
as
a
lover
,
and
commanding
me
to
keep
his
secret
.
 
<EOS>
I
avoid
his
eyes
,
but
he
forces
me
to
see
them
without
looking
at
them
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
a
glaze
comes
over
them
(
which
is
sometimes
the
case
)
,
and
he
seems
to
wander
away
into
a
frightful
sort
of
dream
in
which
he
threatens
most
,
he
obliges
me
to
know
it
,
and
to
know
that
he
is
sitting
close
at
my
side
,
more
terrible
to
me
than
ever
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
this
imagined
threatening
,
pretty
one
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
threatened
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
never
even
dared
to
think
or
wonder
what
it
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
was
this
all
,
to
-
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
was
all
;
except
that
to
-
night
when
he
watched
my
lips
so
closely
as
I
was
singing
,
besides
feeling
terrified
I
felt
ashamed
and
passionately
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
he
kissed
me
,
and
I
could
n't
bear
it
,
but
cried
out
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
never
breathe
this
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
Eddy
is
devoted
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
said
to
-
night
that
you
would
not
be
afraid
of
him
,
under
any
circumstances
,
and
that
gives
me
---
who
am
so
much
afraid
of
him
---
<EOS>
courage
to
tell
only
you
.
 
<EOS>
Hold
me
!
<EOS>
Stay
with
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
too
frightened
to
be
left
by
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
lustrous
gipsy
-
face
drooped
over
the
clinging
arms
and
bosom
,
and
the
wild
black
hair
fell
down
protectingly
over
the
childish
form
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
slumbering
gleam
of
fire
in
the
intense
dark
eyes
,
though
they
were
then
softened
with
compassion
and
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Let
whomsoever
it
most
concerned
look
well
to
it

Daggers

The
two
young
men
,
having
seen
the
damsels
,
their
charges
,
enter
the
courtyard
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
finding
themselves
coldly
stared
at
by
the
brazen
door

plate
,
as
if
the
battered
old
beau
with
the
glass

insolent

look

look

from

of

<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
my
other
good
fortune
?
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
has
made
his
remark
in
a
watchfully
advancing
,
and
yet
furtive
and
shy
manner
,
very
expressive
of
that
peculiar
air
already
noticed
,
of
being
at
once
hunter
and
hunted
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
has
made
his
retort
with
an
abruptness
not
at
all
polite
.
 
<EOS>
They
stop
and
interchange
a
rather
heated
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
"
says
Neville
,
"
there
is
no
offence
,
Mr
Drood
,
in
my
innocently
referring
to
your
betrothal
?
"
   
"
By
George
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Edwin
,
leading
on
again
at
a
somewhat
quicker
pace
;
"
everybody
in
this
chattering
old
Cloisterham
refers
to
it
<EOS>
I
wonder
no
public
-
house
has
been
set
up
,
with
my
portrait
for
the
sign
of
The
Betrothed
's
Head
.
 
<EOS>
Or
Pussy
's
portrait
.
 
<EOS>
One
or
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
accountable
for
Mr
Crisparkle
's
mentioning
the
matter
to
me
,
quite
openly
,
"
Neville
begins
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
;
that
's
true
;
you
are
not
,
"
Edwin
Drood
assents
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
resumes
Neville
,
"
I
am
accountable
for
mentioning
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
so
,
on
the
supposition
that
you
could
not
fail
to
be
highly
proud
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Now
,
there
are
these
two
curious
touches
of
human
nature
working
the
secret
springs
of
this
dialogue
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
Landless
is
already
enough
impressed
by
Little
Rosebud
,
to
feel
indignant
that
Edwin
Drood
(
far
below
her
)
should
hold
his
prize
so
lightly
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
Drood
is
already
enough
impressed
by
Helena
,
to
feel
indignant
that
Helena
's
brother
(
far
below
her
)
should
dispose
of
him
so
coolly
,
and
put
him
out
of
the
way
so
entirely
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
the
last
remark
had
better
be
answered
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
says
Edwin
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
Mr
Neville
"
<EOS>
(
adopting
that
mode
of
address
from
Mr
Crisparkle
)
,
"
that
what
people
are
proudest
of
,
they
usually
talk
most
about
;
I
do
n't
know
either
,
that
what
they
are
proudest
of
,
they
most
like
other
people
to
talk
about
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
live
a
busy
life
,
and
I
speak
under
correction
by
you
readers
,
who
ought
to
know
everything
,
and
I
daresay
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
both
become
savage
;
Mr
Neville
out
in
the
open
;
Edwin
Drood
under
the
transparent
cover
of
a
popular
tune
,
and
a
stop
now
and
then
to
pretend
to
admire
picturesque
effects
in
the
moonlight
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
seem
to
me
very
civil
in
you
,
"
remarks
Neville
,
at
length
,
"
to
reflect
upon
a
stranger
who
comes
here
,
not
having
had
your
advantages
,
to
try
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
to
be
sure
,
I
was
not
brought
up
in
"
busy
life
,
"
and
my
ideas
of
civility
were
formed
among
Heathens
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
the
best
civility
,
whatever
kind
of
people
we
are
brought
up
among
,
"
retorts
Edwin
Drood
,
"
is
to
mind
our
own
business
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
set
me
that
example
,
I
promise
to
follow
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
you
take
a
great
deal
too
much
upon
yourself
?
"
is
the
angry
rejoinder
,
"
and
that
in
the
part
of
the
world
I
come
from
,
you
would
be
called
to
account
for
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
whom
,
for
instance
?
"
asks
Edwin
Drood
,
coming
to
a
halt
,
and
surveying
the
other
with
a
look
of
disdain
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
here
a
startling
right
hand
is
laid
on
Edwin
's
shoulder
,
and
Jasper
stands
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
it
would
seem
that
he
,
too
,
has
strolled
round
by
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
has
come
up
behind
them
on
the
shadowy
side
of
the
road
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ned
,
Ned
,
Ned
!
"
<EOS>
he
says
;
"
we
must
have
no
more
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
overheard
high
words
between
you
two
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
,
my
dear
boy
,
you
are
almost
in
the
position
of
host
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
You
belong
,
as
it
were
,
to
the
place
,
and
in
a
manner
represent
it
towards
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
is
a
stranger
,
and
you
should
respect
the
obligations
of
hospitality
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
Mr
Neville
,
"
laying
his
left
hand
on
the
inner
shoulder
of
that
young
gentleman
,
and
thus
walking
on
between
them
<EOS>
,
hand
to
shoulder
on
either
side
:
"
you
will
pardon
me
;
but
I
appeal
to
you
to
govern
your
temper
too
.
<EOS>
Now
,
what
is
amiss
?
 
<EOS>
But
why
ask
!
 
<EOS>
Let
there
be
nothing
amiss
,
and
the
question
is
superfluous
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
all
three
on
a
good
understanding
,
are
we
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
silent
struggle
between
the
two
young
men
who
shall
speak
last
,
Edwin
Drood
strikes
in
with
:
 
"
So
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
Jack
,
there
is
no
anger
in
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nor
in
me
,
"
says
Neville
Landless
,
though
not
so
freely
;
or
perhaps
so
carelessly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
if
Mr
Drood
knew
all
that
lies
behind
me
,
far
away
from
here
,
he
might
know
better
how
it
is
that
sharp
-
edged
words
have
sharp
edges
to
wound
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
says
Jasper
,
in
a
soothing
manner
,
"
we
had
better
not
qualify
our
good
understanding
.
 
<EOS>
We
had
better
not
say
anything
having
the
appearance
of
a
remonstrance
or
condition
;
it
might
not
seem
generous
.
 
<EOS>
Frankly
and
freely
,
you
see
there
is
no
anger
in
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
Frankly
and
freely
,
there
is
no
anger
in
you
,
Mr
Neville
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
at
all
,
Mr
Jasper
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Still
,
not
quite
so
frankly
or
so
freely
;
or
,
be
it
said
once
again
,
not
quite
so
carelessly
perhaps
.
   
<EOS>
"
All
over
then
!
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
bachelor
gatehouse
is
a
few
yards
from
here
,
and
the
heater
is
on
the
fire
,
and
the
wine
and
glasses
are
on
the
table
,
and
it
is
not
a
stone
's
throw
from
Minor
Canon
Corner
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
,
you
are
up
and
away
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
carry
Mr
Neville
in
with
us
,
to
take
a
stirrup
-
cup
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
Jack
.
"
   
"
And
with
all
mine
,
Mr
Jasper
.
"
 
Neville
feels
it
impossible
to
say
less
,
but
would
rather
not
go
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
an
impression
upon
him
that
he
has
lost
hold
of
his
temper
;
feels
that
Edwin
Drood
's
coolness
,
so
far
from
being
infectious
,
makes
him
red
-
hot
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
,
still
walking
in
the
centre
,
hand
to
shoulder
on
either
side
,
beautifully
turns
the
Refrain
of
a
drinking
song
,
and
they
all
go
up
to
his
rooms
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
the
first
object
visible
,
when
he
adds
the
light
of
a
lamp
to
that
of
the
fire
,
is
the
portrait
over
the
chimneypicce
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
an
object
calculated
to
improve
the
understanding
between
the
two
young
men
,
as
rather
awkwardly
reviving
the
subject
of
their
difference
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
both
glance
at
it
consciously
,
but
say
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
,
however
(
who
would
appear
from
his
conduct
to
have
gained
but
an
imperfect
clue
to
the
cause
of
their
late
high
words
)
,
directly
calls
attention
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
recognise
that
picture
,
Mr
Neville
?
"
shading
the
lamp
to
throw
the
light
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
recognise
it
,
but
it
is
far
from
flattering
the
original
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
you
are
hard
upon
it

<EOS>
It
was
done
by
Ned
,
who
made
me
a
present
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
that
,
Mr
Drood
.
"
 
<EOS>
Neville
apologises
,
with
a
real
intention
to
apologise
;
"
if
I
had
known
I
was
in
the
artist
's
presence
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
O
,
a
joke
,
sir
,
a
mere
joke
,
"
Edwin
cuts
in
,
with
a
provoking
yawn
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
little
humouring
of
Pussy
's
points
!
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
paint
her
gravely
,
one
of
these
days
,
if
she
's
good
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
air
of
leisurely
patronage
and
indifference
with
which
this
is
said
,
as
the
speaker
throws
himself
back
in
a
chair
and
clasps
his
hands
at
the
back
of
his
head
,
as
a
rest
for
it
,
is
very
exasperating
to
the
excitable
and
excited
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
looks
observantly
from
the
one
to
the
other
,
slightly
smiles
,
and
turns
his
back
to
mix
a
jug
of
mulled
wine
at
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
require
much
mixing
and
compounding
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
Mr
Neville
,
"
says
Edwin
,
quick
to
resent
the
indignant
protest
against
himself
in
the
face
of
young
Landless
,
which
is
fully
as
visible
as
the
portrait
,
or
the
fire
,
or
the
lamp
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
that
if
you
painted
the
picture
of
your
lady
love
---
"
   
"
I
ca
n't
paint
,
"
is
the
hasty
interruption
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
your
misfortune
,
and
not
your
fault
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
if
you
could
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
you
could
,
I
suppose
you
would
make
her
(
no
matter
what
she
was
in
reality
)
,
Juno
,
Minerva
,
Diana
,
and
Venus
,
all
in
one
.
 
<EOS>
Eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
lady
love
,
and
I
ca
n't
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
to
try
my
hand
,
"
says
Edwin
,
with
a
boyish
boastfulness
getting
up
in
him
,
"
on
a
portrait
of
Miss
Landless
<EOS>
---
in
earnest
,
mind
you
;
in
earnest
---
you
should
see
what
I
could
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
sister
's
consent
to
sit
for
it
being
first
got
,
I
suppose
?
 
<EOS>
As
it
never
will
be
got
,
I
am
afraid
I
shall
never
see
what
you
can
do
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
bear
the
loss
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
turns
round
from
the
fire
,
fills
a
large
goblet
glass
for
Neville
,
fills
a
large
goblet
glass
for
Edwin
,
and
hands
each
his
own
;
then
fills
for
himself
,
saying
:
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Mr
Neville
<EOS>
,
we
are
to
drink
to
my
nephew
,
Ned
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
his
foot
that
is
in
the
stirrup
---
metaphorically
---
our
stirrup
-
cup
is
to
be
devoted
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Ned
,
my
dearest
fellow
,
my
love
!
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
sets
the
example
of
nearly
emptying
his
glass
,
and
Neville
follows
it
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
Drood
says
,
"
Thank
you
both
very
much
,
"
and
follows
the
double
example
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
him
,
"
cries
Jasper
,
stretching
out
his
hand
admiringly
and
tenderly
,
though
rallyingly
too
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
where
he
lounges
so
easily
,
Mr
Neville
!
 
<EOS>
The
world
is
all
before
him
where
to
choose
.
 
<EOS>
A
life
of
stirring
work
and
interest
,
a
life
of
change
and
excitement
,
a
life
of
domestic
ease
and
love
!
 
<EOS>
Look
at
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
Drood
's
face
has
become
quickly
and
remarkably
flushed
with
the
wine
;
so
has
the
face
of
Neville
Landless
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
still
sits
thrown
back
in
his
chair
,
making
that
rest
of
clasped
hands
for
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
See
how
little
he
heeds
it
all
!
"
 
<EOS>
Jasper
proceeds
in
a
bantering
vein
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
hardly
worth
his
while
to
pluck
the
golden
fruit
that
hangs
ripe
on
the
tree
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
consider
the
contrast
,
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
no
prospect
of
stirring
work
and
interest
,
or
of
change
and
excitement
,
or
of
domestic
ease
and
love
.
 
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
no
prospect
(
unless
you
are
more
fortunate
than
I
am
,
which
may
easily
be
)
,
but
the
tedious
unchanging
round
of
this
dull
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
soul
,
Jack
,
"
says
Edwin
,
complacently
,
"
I
feel
quite
apologetic
for
having
my
way
smoothed
as
you
describe
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
know
what
I
know
,
Jack
,
and
it
may
not
be
so
very
easy
as
it
seems
,
after
all
.
 
<EOS>
May
it
,
Pussy
?
"
 
<EOS>
To
the
portrait
,
with
a
snap
of
his
thumb
and
finger
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
got
to
hit
it
off
yet
;
have
n't
we
,
Pussy
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
what
I
mean
,
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
His
speech
has
become
thick
and
indistinct
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
,
quiet
and
self
-
possessed
,
looks
to
Neville
,
as
expecting
his
answer
or
comment
.
 
<EOS>
When
Neville
speaks
,
HIS
speech
is
also
thick
and
indistinct
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
might
have
been
better
for
Mr
Drood
to
have
known
some
hardships
,
"
he
says
,
defiantly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
"
retorts
Edwin
,
turning
merely
his
eyes
in
that
direction
<EOS>
,
"
pray
why
might
it
have
been
better
for
Mr
Drood
to
have
known
some
hardships
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
"
Jasper
assents
,
with
an
air
of
interest
;
"
let
us
know
why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
they
might
have
made
him
more
sensible
,
"
says
Neville
,
"
of
good
fortune
that
is
not
by
any
means
necessarily
the
result
of
his
own
merits
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
quickly
looks
to
his
nephew
for
his
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
YOU
known
hardships
,
may
I
ask
?
"
says
Edwin
Drood
,
sitting
upright
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
quickly
looks
to
the
other
for
his
retort
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
what
have
they
made
you
sensible
of
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
's
play
of
eyes
between
the
two
holds
good
throughout
the
dialogue
,
to
the
end
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
once
before
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
nothing
of
the
sort
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
That
you
take
a
great
deal
too
much
upon
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
added
something
else
to
that
,
if
I
remember
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
say
something
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
it
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
that
in
the
part
of
the
world
I
come
from
,
you
would
be
called
to
account
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
there
?
"
cries
Edwin
Drood
,
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
long
way
off
,
I
believe
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
<EOS>
;
I
see
!
 
<EOS>
That
part
of
the
world
is
at
a
safe
distance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
here
,
then
,
"
rejoins
the
other
,
rising
in
a
fury
.
 
<EOS>
"
Say
anywhere
!
 
<EOS>
Your
vanity
is
intolerable
,
your
conceit
is
beyond
endurance
;
you
talk
as
if
you
were
some
rare
and
precious
prize
,
instead
of
a
common
boaster
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
a
common
fellow
,
and
a
common
boaster
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Pooh
,
pooh
<EOS>
,
"
says
Edwin
Drood
,
equally
furious
,
but
more
collected
;
"
how
should
you
know
?
 
<EOS>
You
may
know
a
black
common
fellow
,
or
a
black
common
boaster
,
when
you
see
him
(
and
no
doubt
you
have
a
large
acquaintance
that
way
)
;
but
you
are
no
judge
of
white
men
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
insulting
allusion
to
his
dark
skin
infuriates
Neville
to
that
violent
degree
,
that
he
flings
the
dregs
of
his
wine
at
Edwin
Drood
,
and
is
in
the
act
of
flinging
the
goblet
after
it
,
when
his
arm
is
caught
in
the
nick
of
time
by
Jasper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ned
,
my
dear
fellow
!
"
<EOS>
he
cries
in
a
loud
voice
;
"
I
entreat
you
,
<EOS>
I
command
you
,
to
be
still
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
has
been
a
rush
of
all
the
three
,
and
a
clattering
of
glasses
and
overturning
of
chairs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mr
Neville
,
for
shame
!
 
<EOS>
Give
this
glass
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
Open
your
hand
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
WILL
have
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
Neville
throws
him
off
,
and
pauses
for
an
instant
,
in
a
raging
passion
,
with
the
goblet
yet
in
his
uplifted
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
dashes
it
down
under
the
grate
,
with
such
force
that
the
broken
splinters
fly
out
again
in
a
shower
;
and
he
leaves
the
house
.
   
<EOS>
When
he
first
emerges
into
the
night
air
,
nothing
around
him
is
still
or
steady
;
nothing
around
him
shows
like
what
it
is
;
he
only
knows
that
he
stands
with
a
bare
head
in
the
midst
of
a
blood
-
red
whirl
,
waiting
to
be
struggled
with
,
and
to
struggle
to
the
death
.
   
<EOS>
But
,
nothing
happening
,
and
the
moon
looking
down
upon
him
as
if
he
were
dead
after
a
fit
of
wrath
<EOS>
,
he
holds
his
steam
-
hammer
beating
head
and
heart
,
and
staggers
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
becomes
half
-
conscious
of
having
heard
himself
bolted
and
barred
out
,
like
a
dangerous
animal
;
and
thinks
what
shall
he
do
?
   
<EOS>
Some
wildly
passionate
ideas
of
the
river
dissolve
under
the
spell
of
the
moonlight
on
the
Cathedral
and
the
graves
,
and
the
remembrance
of
his
sister
,
and
the
thought
of
what
he
owes
to
the
good
man
who
has
but
that
very
day
won
his
confidence
and
given
him
his
pledge
.
 
<EOS>
He
repairs
to
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
and
knocks
softly
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
Mr
Crisparkle
's
custom
to
sit
up
last
of
the
early
household
,
very
softly
touching
his
piano
and
practising
his
favourite
parts
in
concerted
vocal
music
.
 
<EOS>
The
south
wind
that
goes
where
it
lists
,
by
way
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
on
a
still
night
,
is
not
more
subdued
than
Mr
Crisparkle
at
such
times
,
regardful
of
the
slumbers
of
the
china
shepherdess
.
   
<EOS>
His
knock
is
immediately
answered
by
Mr
Crisparkle
himself
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
opens
the
door
,
candle
in
hand
,
his
cheerful
face
falls
,
and
disappointed
amazement
is
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Neville
!
 
<EOS>
In
this
disorder
!
 
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
to
Mr
Jasper
's
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Minor
Canon
props
him
by
the
elbow
with
a
strong
hand
(
in
a
strictly
scientific
manner
,
worthy
of
his
morning
trainings
)
,
and
turns
him
into
his
own
little
book
-
room
,
and
shuts
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
begun
ill
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
begun
dreadfully
ill
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
true
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
sober
,
Mr
Neville
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
I
am
not
,
sir
,
though
I
can
satisfy
you
at
another
time
that
I
have
had
a
very
little
indeed
to
drink
,
and
that
it
overcame
me
in
the
strangest
and
most
sudden
manner
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Neville
,
Mr
Neville
,
"
says
the
Minor
Canon
,
shaking
his
head
with
a
sorrowful
smile
;
"
I
have
heard
that
said
before
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
---
my
mind
is
much
confused
,
but
<EOS>
I
think
---
it
is
equally
true
of
Mr
Jasper
's
nephew
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
is
the
dry
rejoinder
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
quarrelled
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
He
insulted
me
most
grossly
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
heated
that
tigerish
blood
<EOS>
I
told
you
of
to
-
day
,
before
then
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Neville
,
"
rejoins
the
Minor
Canon
,
mildly
,
but
firmly
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
request
you
not
to
speak
to
me
with
that
clenched
right
hand
.
<EOS>
Unclench
it
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
goaded
me
,
sir
,
"
pursues
the
young
man
,
instantly
obeying
,
"
beyond
my
power
of
endurance
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
whether
or
no
he
meant
it
at
first
,
but
he
did
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
meant
it
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
sir
,
"
with
an
irrepressible
outburst
,
"
in
the
passion
into
which
he
lashed
me
,
I
would
have
cut
him
down
if
I
could
,
and
I
tried
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
clenched
that
hand
again
,
"
is
Mr
Crisparkle
's
quiet
commentary
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
your
room
,
for
I
showed
it
you
before
dinner
;
but
I
will
accompany
you
to
it
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
Your
arm
,
if
you
please
.
 
<EOS>
Softly
,
for
the
house
is
all
a
-
bed
.
"
   
<EOS>
Scooping
his
hand
into
the
same
scientific
elbow
-
rest
as
before
,
and
backing
it
up
with
the
inert
strength
of
his
arm
,
as
skilfully
as
a
Police
Expert
,
and
with
an
apparent
repose
quite
unattainable
by
novices
,
Mr
Crisparkle
conducts
his
pupil
to
the
pleasant
and
orderly
old
room
prepared
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
the
young
man
throws
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
,
flinging
his
arms
upon
his
reading

The
gentle
Minor
Canon
has
had
it
in
his
thoughts
to
leave
the
room
,
without
a
word
.
 
<EOS>
But
looking
round
at
the
door
,
and
seeing
this
dejected
figure
,
he
turns
back
to
it
,
touches
it
with
a
mild
hand
,
says
"
Good
night
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
sob
is
his
only
acknowledgment
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
have
had
many
a
worse
;
perhaps
,
could
have
had
few
better
.
   
<EOS>
Another
soft
knock
at
the
outer
door
attracts
his
attention
as
he
goes
down

stairs
.
 
<EOS>
He
opens
it
to
Mr
Jasper

holding
in
his
hand
the
pupil
's
hat
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
an
awful
scene
with
him
,
"
says
Jasper
,
in
a
low
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Has
it
been
so
bad
as
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Murderous
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
remonstrates
:
 
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
Do
not
use
such
strong
words
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
might
have
laid
my
dear
boy
dead
at
my
feet
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
fault
of
his
,
that
he
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
I
was
,
through
the
mercy
of
God
,
swift
and
strong
with
him
,
he
would
have
cut
him
down
on
my
hearth
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
phrase
smites
home
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
thinks
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
his
own
words
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Seeing
what
I
have
seen
to
-
night
,
and
hearing
what
I
have
heard
,
"
adds
Jasper
,
with
great
earnestness
,
"
I
shall
never
know
peace
of
mind
when
there
is
danger
of
those
two
coming
together
,
with
no
one
else
to
interfere

<EOS>
It
was
horrible
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
something
of
the
tiger
in
his
dark
blood
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
thinks
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
so
he
said
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You

my
dear
sir

"
pursues
Jasper
,
taking
his
hand
,
"
even
you
,
have
accepted
a
dangerous
charge

"
   
<EOS>
"
You
need
have
no
fear
for
me
,
Jasper

"
returns
Mr
Crisparkle
,
with
a
quiet
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
I

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
none
for
myself
,
"
returns
Jasper
,
with
an
emphasis
on
the
last
pronoun
,
"
because
I
am
not
,
nor
am
I
in
the
way
of
being
,
the
object
of
his
hostility
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
may
be
,
and
my
dear

has
been
.
<EOS>
Good
night

<EOS>
Mr

goes
in
,
with
the
hat
that
has
so
easily
,
so
almost
imperceptibly
,
acquired
the
right
to
be
hung
up

<EOS>
Birds
in
the
bush
 
Rosa
,
having
no
relation
that
she
knew
of
in
the
world
,
had
,
from
the
seventh
year
of
her
age
,
known
no
home
<EOS>
but
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
no
mother
but
Miss
Twinkleton
.
 
<EOS>
Her
remembrance
of
her
own
mother
was
of
a
pretty
little
creature
like
herself
(
not
much
older
than
herself
<EOS>
it
seemed
to
her
)
,
who
had
been
brought
home
in
her
father
's
arms
,
drowned
.
 
<EOS>
The
fatal
accident
had
happened
at
a
party
of
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
Every
fold
and
colour
in
the
pretty
summer
dress
,
and
even
the
long
wet
hair
,
with
scattered
petals
of
ruined
flowers
still
clinging
to
it
,
as
the
dead
young
figure
,
in
its
sad
,
sad
beauty
lay
upon
the
bed
,
were
fixed
indelibly
in
Rosa
's
recollection
.
 
<EOS>
So
were
the
wild
despair
and
the
subsequent
bowed
-
down
grief
of
her
poor
young
father
,
who
died
broken
-
hearted
on
the
first
anniversary
of
that
hard
day
.
   
<EOS>
The
betrothal
of
Rosa
grew
out
of
the
soothing
of
his
year
of
mental
distress
by
his
fast
friend
and
old
college
companion
,
Drood
:
 
who
likewise
had
been
left
a
widower
in
his
youth
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
,
too
,
went
the
silent
road
into
which
all
earthly
pilgrimages
merge
,
some
sooner
,
and
some
later
;
and
thus
the
young
couple
had
come
to
be
as
they
were
.
   
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
pity
surrounding
the
little
orphan
girl
when
she
first
came
to
Cloisterham
,
had
never
cleared
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
taken
brighter
hues
as
she
grew
older
,
happier
,
prettier
;
now
it
had
been
golden
,
now
roseate
,
and
now
azure
;
but
it
had
always
adorned
her
with
some
soft
light
of
its
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
desire
to
console
and
caress
her
,
had
caused
her
to
be
treated
in
the
beginning
as
a
child
much
younger
than
her
years
;
the
same
desire
had
caused
her
to
be
still
petted
when
she
was
a
child
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Who
should
be
her
favourite
,
who
should
anticipate
this
or
that
small
present
,
or
do
her
this
or
that
small
service
;
who
should
take
her
home
for
the
holidays
;
who
should
write
to
her
the
oftenest
when
they
were
separated
,
and
whom
she
would
most
rejoice
to
see
again
when
they
were
reunited
;
even
these
gentle
rivalries
were
not
without
their
slight
dashes
of
bitterness
in
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
Well
for
the
poor
Nuns
in
their
day
,
if
they
hid
no
harder
strife
under
their
veils
and
rosaries
!
   
<EOS>
Thus
Rosa
had
grown
to
be
an
amiable
,
giddy
,
wilful
,
winning
little
creature
;
spoilt
,
in
the
sense
of
counting
upon
kindness
from
all
around
her
;
but
not
in
the
sense
of
repaying
it
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
Possessing
an
exhaustless
well
of
affection
in
her
nature
,
its
sparkling
waters
had
freshened
and
brightened
the
Nuns
'
House
for
years
,
and
yet
its
depths
had
never
yet
been
moved
:
 
<EOS>
what
might
betide
when
that
came
to
pass
;
what
developing
changes
might
fall
upon
the
heedless
head
,
and
light
heart
,
then
;
remained
to
be
seen
.
   
<EOS>
By
what
means
the
news
that
there
had
been
a
quarrel
between
the
two
young
men
overnight
,
involving
even
some
kind
of
onslaught
by
Mr
Neville
upon
Edwin
Drood
,
got
into
Miss
Twinkleton
's
establishment
before
breakfast
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
brought
in
by
the
birds
of
the
air
,
or
came
blowing
in
with
the
very
air
itself
,
when
the
casement
windows
were
set
open
;
whether
the
baker
brought
it
kneaded
into
the
bread
,
or
the
milkman
delivered
it
as
part
of
the
adulteration
of
his
milk
;
or
the
housemaids
,
beating
the
dust
out
of
their
mats
against
the
gateposts
,
received
it
in
exchange
deposited
on
the
mats
by
the
town
atmosphere
;
<EOS>
certain
it
is
that
the
news
permeated
every
gable
of
the
old
building
before
Miss
Twinkleton
was
down
,
and
that
Miss
Twinkleton
herself
received
it
through
Mrs
Tisher
,
while
yet
in
the
act
of
dressing
;
or
(
as
she
might
have
expressed
the
phrase
to
a
parent
or
guardian
of
a
mythological
turn
)
of
sacrificing
to
the
Graces
.
   
<EOS>
Miss

<EOS>
Miss
Landless
's
brother
had
thrown
a
knife
at
Mr
Edwin
Drood

<EOS>
A
knife
became
suggestive
of
a
fork
;
and
Miss
Landless
's
brother
had
thrown
a
fork
at
Mr
Edwin
Drood
.
   
<EOS>
As
in
the
governing
precedence
of
Peter
Piper
,
alleged
to
have
picked
the
peck
of
pickled
pepper
,
it
was
held
physically
desirable
to
have
evidence
of
the
existence
of
the
peck
of
pickled
pepper
which
Peter
Piper
was
alleged
to
have
picked
;
so
,
in
this
case
,
it
was
held
psychologically
important
to
know
why
Miss
Landless
's
brother
threw
a
bottle
,
knife
,
or
fork
-
or
bottle
,
knife
,
AND
fork
---
for
the
cook
had
been
given
to
understand
it
was
all
three
---
at
Mr
Edwin
Drood
?
   
<EOS>
Well
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Landless
's
brother
had
said
he
admired
Miss
Bud
.
<EOS>
Mr
Edwin
Drood
had
said
to
Miss
Landless
's
brother
that
he
had
no
business
to
admire
Miss
Bud
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Landless
's
brother
had
then
"
up'd
"
<EOS>
(
this
was
the
cook
's
exact
information
)
with
the
bottle
,
knife
,
fork
,
and
decanter
<EOS>
(
the
decanter
now
coolly
flying
at
everybody
's
head
,
without
the
least
introduction
)
,
and
thrown
them
all
at
Mr
Edwin
Drood
.
   
<EOS>
Poor
little
Rosa
put
a
forefinger
into
each
of
her
ears
when
these
rumours
began
to
circulate
,
and
retired
into
a
corner
,
beseeching
not
to
be
told
any
more
;
but
Miss
Landless
,
begging
permission
of
Miss
Twinkleton
to
go
and
speak
with
her
brother
,
and
pretty
plainly
showing
that
she
would
take
it
if
it
were
not
given
,
struck
out
the
more
definite
course
of
going
to
Mr
Crisparkle
's
for
accurate
intelligence
.
   
<EOS>
When
she
came
back
(
being
first
closeted
with
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
order
that
anything
objectionable
in
her
tidings
might
be
retained
by
that
discreet
filter
)
,
she
imparted
to
Rosa
only
,
what
had
taken
place
;
dwelling
with
a
flushed
cheek
on
the
provocation
her
brother
had
received
,
but
almost
limiting
it
to
that
last
gross
affront
as
crowning
"
some
other
words
between
them
,
"
and
,
out
of
consideration
for
her
new
friend
,
passing
lightly
over
the
fact
that
the
other
words
had
originated
in
her
lover
's
taking
things
in
general
so
very
easily
.
 
<EOS>
To
Rosa
direct
,
she
brought
a
petition
from
her
brother
that
she
would
forgive
him
;
and
,
having
delivered
it
with
sisterly
earnestness
,
made
an
end
of
the
subject
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
reserved
for
Miss
Twinkleton
to
tone
down
the
public
mind
of
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
That
lady
,
therefore
,
entering
in
a
stately
manner
what
plebeians
might
have
called
the
school
-
room
,
but
what
,
in
the
patrician
language
of
the
head
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
was
euphuistically
,
not
to
say
round
-
aboutedly
,
denominated
"
the
apartment
allotted
to
study
,
"
and
saying
with
a
forensic
air
,
"
Ladies
!
"
<EOS>
all
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Tisher
at
the
same
time
grouped
herself
behind
her
chief
,
as
representing
Queen
Elizabeth
's
first
historical
female
friend
at
Tilbury
fort
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
then
proceeded
to
remark
that
Rumour
,
Ladies
,
had
been
represented
by
the
bard
of
Avon
---
needless
were
it
to
mention
the
immortal
SHAKESPEARE
,
also
called
the
Swan
of
his
native
river
,
not
improbably
with
some
reference
to
the
ancient
superstition
that
that
bird
of
graceful
plumage
(
Miss
Jennings
will
please
stand
upright
)
sang
sweetly
on
the
approach
of
death
,
for
which
we
have
no
ornithological
authority
,
---
Rumour
,
Ladies
,
had
been
represented
by
that
bard

Rumour
in
Cloisterham
<EOS>
(
Miss
Ferdinand
will
honour
me
with
her
attention
)
was
no
exception
to
the
great
limner

portrait
of
Rumour
elsewhere
.
 
<EOS>
A
slight
FRACAS
between
two
young
gentlemen
occurring
last
night
within
a
hundred
miles
of
these
peaceful
walls
(
Miss
Ferdinand
,
being
apparently
incorrigible
,
will
have
the
kindness
to
write
out
this
evening
,
in
the
original
language
,
the
first
four
fables
of
our
vivacious
neighbour
,
Monsieur
La
Fontaine
)
had
been
very
grossly
exaggerated
by
Rumour
's
voice
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
first
alarm
and
anxiety
arising
from
our
sympathy
with
a
sweet
young
friend
,
not
wholly
to
be
dissociated
from
one
of
the
gladiators
in
the
bloodless
arena
in
question
(
the
impropriety
of
Miss
Reynolds
's
appearing
to
stab
herself
in
the
hand
with
a
pin
,
is
far
too
obvious
,
and
too
glaringly
unladylike
,
to
be
pointed
out
)
,
we
descended
from
our
maiden
elevation
to
discuss
this
uncongenial
and
this
unfit
theme
.
 
<EOS>
Responsible
inquiries
having
assured
us
that
it
was
but
one
of
those
"
airy
nothings
"
pointed
at
by
the
Poet
(
whose
name
and
date
of
birth
Miss
Giggles
will
supply
within
half
an
hour
)
<EOS>
,
we
would
now
discard
the
subject
,
and
concentrate
our
minds
upon
the
grateful
labours
of
the
day
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
subject
so
survived
all
day
,
nevertheless
,
that
Miss
Ferdinand
got
into
new
trouble
by
surreptitiously
clapping
on
a
paper
moustache
at
dinner
-
time
,
and
going
through
the
motions
of
aiming
a
water
-
bottle
at
Miss
Giggles
,
who
drew
a
table
-
spoon
in
defence
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
Rosa
thought
of
this
unlucky
quarrel
a
great
deal
,
and
thought
of
it
with
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
she
was
involved
in
it
,
as
cause
,
or
consequence
,
or
what
not
,
through
being
in
a
false
position
altogether
as
to
her
marriage
engagement
.
 
<EOS>
Never
free
from
such
uneasiness
when
she
was
with
her
affianced
husband
,
it
was
not
likely
that
she
would
be
free
from
it
when
they
were
apart
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
too
,
she
was
cast
in
upon
herself
,
and
deprived
of
the
relief
of
talking
freely
with
her
new
friend
,
because
the
quarrel
had
been
with
Helena
's
brother
,
and
Helena
undisguisedly
avoided
the
subject
as
a
delicate
and
difficult
one
to
herself
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
critical
time
,
of
all
times
,
Rosa
's
guardian
was
announced
as
having
come
to
see
her
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
had
been
well
selected
for
his
trust
,
as
a
man
of
incorruptible
integrity
,
but
certainly
for
no
other
appropriate
quality
discernible
on
the
surface
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
arid
,
sandy
man
,
who
,
if
he
had
been
put
into
a
grinding
-
mill
,
looked
as
if
he
would
have
ground
immediately
into
high
-
dried
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
scanty
flat
crop
of
hair
,
in
colour
and
consistency
like
some
very
mangy
yellow
fur
tippet
;
it
was
so
unlike
hair
,
that
it
must
have
been
a
wig
,
but
for
the
stupendous
improbability
of
anybody
's
voluntarily
sporting
such
a
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
play
of
feature
that
his
face
presented
,
was
cut
deep
into
it
,
in
a
few
hard
curves
that
made
it
more
like
work
;
and
he
had
certain
notches
in
his
forehead
,
which
looked
as
though
Nature
had
been
about
to
touch
them
into
sensibility
or
refinement
,
when
she
had
impatiently
thrown
away
the
chisel
,
and
said
:
 
"
I
really
can
not
be
worried
to
finish
off
this
man
;
let
him
go
as
he
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
too
great
length
of
throat
at
his
upper
end
,
and
too
much
ankle
-
bone
and
heel
at
his
lower
;
with
an
awkward
and
hesitating
manner
;
with
a
shambling
walk
;
and
with
what
is
called
a
near
sight
---
which
perhaps
prevented
his
observing
how
much
white
cotton
stocking
he
displayed
to
the
public
eye
,
in
contrast
with
his
black
suit
---
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
still
had
some
strange
capacity
in
him
of
making
on
the
whole
an
agreeable
impression
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
was
discovered
by
his
ward
,
much
discomfited
by
being
in
Miss
Twinkleton
's
company
in
Miss
Twinkleton
's
own
sacred
room
.
<EOS>
Dim
forebodings
of
being
examined
in
something
,
and
not
coming
well
out
of
it
,
seemed
to
oppress
the
poor
gentleman
when
found
in
these
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
how
much
improved
you
are
.
 
<EOS>
Permit
me
to
hand
you
a
chair
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
rose
at
her
little
writing
-
table
,
saying
,
with
general
sweetness
,
as
to
the
polite
Universe
:
 
"
Will
you
permit
me
to
retire
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
madam
,
on
my
account
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
that
you
will
not
move
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
entreat
permission
to
MOVE
,
"
returned
Miss
Twinkleton
,
repeating
the
word
with
a
charming
grace
;
"
but
I
will
not
withdraw
,
since
you
are
so
obliging
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
wheel
my
desk
to
this
corner
window
,
shall
I
be
in
the
way
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Madam
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
way
!
"
   
"
You
are
very
kind
.
---
Rosa
,
my
dear
,
you
will
be
under
no
restraint
,
I
am
sure
.
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Grewgious
,
left
by
the
fire
with
Rosa
,
said
again
:
 
"
My
dear
,
how
do
you
do
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
see
you
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
having
waited
for
her
to
sit
down
,
sat
down
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
visits
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
are
,
like
those
of
the
angels
---
<EOS>
not
that
I
compare
myself
to
an
angel
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
by
any
means
,
"
assented
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
merely
refer
to
my
visits
,
which
are
few
and
far
between
.
 
<EOS>
The
angels
are
,
we
know
very
well
,
up
-
stairs
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
looked
round
with
a
kind
of
stiff
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
refer
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
laying
his
hand
on
Rosa
's
,
as
the
possibility
thrilled
through
his
frame
of
his
otherwise
seeming
to
take
the
awful
liberty
of
calling
Miss
Twinkleton
my
dear
<EOS>
;
"
I
refer
to
the
other
young
ladies
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
resumed
her
writing
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
a
sense
of
not
having
managed
his
opening
point
quite
as
neatly
as
he
might
have
desired
,
smoothed
his
head
from
back
to
front
as
if
he
had
just
dived
,
and
were
pressing
the
water
out
---
this
smoothing
action
,
however
superfluous
,
was
habitual
with
him
---
and
took
a
pocket
-
book
from
his
coat
-
pocket
,
and
a
stump
of
black
-
lead
pencil
from
his
waistcoat
-
pocket
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
made
,
"
he
said
,
turning
the
leaves
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
made
a
guiding
memorandum
or
so
---
as
I
usually
do
,
for
I
have
no
conversational
powers
<EOS>
whatever
---
to
which
I
will
,
with
your
permission
,
my
dear
,
refer
.
 
<EOS>
"
Well
and
happy
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Truly
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
well
and
happy
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
You
look
so
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
indeed
,
sir
,
"
answered
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
For
which
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
a
bend
of
his
head
towards
the
corner
window
,
"
our
warmest
acknowledgments
are
due
,
and
I
am
sure
are
rendered
,
to
the
maternal
kindness
and
the
constant
care
and
consideration
of
the
lady
whom
I
have
now
the
honour
to
see
before
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
point
,
again
,
made
but
a
lame
departure
from
Mr
Grewgious
,
and
never
got
to
its
destination
;
for
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
feeling
that
the
courtesies
required
her
to
be
by
this
time
quite
outside
the
conversation
,
was
biting
the
end
of
her
pen
,
and
looking
upward
,
as
waiting
for
the
descent
of
an
idea
from
any
member
of
the
Celestial
Nine
who
might
have
one
to
spare
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
smoothed
his
smooth
head
again
,
and
then
made
another
reference
to
his
pocket
-
book
;
lining
out
"
well
and
happy
,
"
as
disposed
of
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
,
"
is
my
next
note
.
 
<EOS>
A
dry
subject
for
a
young
lady
,
but
an
important
subject
too
.
 
<EOS>
Life
is
pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
.
 
<EOS>
Death
is
---
"
 
A
sudden
recollection
of
the
death
of
her
two
parents
seemed
to
stop
him
,
and
he
said
in
a
softer
tone
,
and
evidently
inserting
the
negative
as
an
after
-
thought
:
 
"
Death
is
NOT
pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
voice
was
as
hard
and
dry
as
himself
,
and
Fancy
might
have
ground
it
straight
,
like
himself
,
into
high
-
dried
snuff
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
through
the
very
limited
means
of
expression
that
he
possessed
,
he
seemed
to
express
kindness
.
 
<EOS>
If
Nature
had
but
finished
him
off
,
kindness
might
have
been
recognisable
in
his
face
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
But
if
the
notches
in
his
forehead
would
n't
fuse
together
,
and
if
his
face
would
work
and
could
n't
play
,
what
could
he
do
,
poor
man
!
   
<EOS>
"
"
Pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
You
find
your
allowance
always
sufficient
for
your
wants
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
wanted
for
nothing
,
and
therefore
it
was
ample
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
you
are
not
in
debt
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
laughed
at
the
idea
of
being
in
debt
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
to
her
inexperience
,
a
comical
vagary
of
the
imagination
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
stretched
his
near
sight
to
be
sure
that
this
was
her
view
of
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
comment
,
with
a
furtive
glance
towards
Miss
Twinkleton
,
and
lining
out
pounds
,
shillings
,
and
pence
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
spoke
of
having
got
among
the
angels
!
 
<EOS>
So
I
did
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
felt
what
his
next
memorandum
would
prove
to
be
,
and
was
blushing
and
folding
a
crease
in
her
dress
with
one
embarrassed
hand
,
long
before
he
found
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
"
Marriage
.
"
 
Hem
!
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
carried
his
smoothing
hand
down
over
his
eyes
and
nose
,
and
even
chin
,
before
drawing
his
chair
a
little
nearer
,
and
speaking
a
little
more
confidentially
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
now
touch
,
my
dear
,
upon
the
point
that
is
the
direct
cause
of
my
troubling
you
with
the
present
visit
.
 
<EOS>
Othenwise
,
being
a
particularly
Angular
man
<EOS>
,
I
should
not
have
intruded
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
last
man
to
intrude
into
a
sphere
for
which
I
am
so
entirely
unfitted
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
,
on
these
premises
,
as
if
I
was
a
bear
---
with
the
cramp
---
in
a
youthful
Cotillon
.
"
   
<EOS>
His
ungainliness
gave
him
enough
of
the
air
of
his
simile
to
set
Rosa
off
laughing
heartily
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
strikes
you
in
the
same
light
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
perfect
calmness
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
to
my
memorandum
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Edwin
has
been
to
and
fro
here
,
as
was
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
mentioned
that
,
in
your
quarterly
letters
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
like
him
,
and
he
likes
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
LIKE
him
very
much
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
said
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
her
guardian
,
for
whose
ear
the
timid
emphasis
was
much
too
fine
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
correspond
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
write
to
one
another
,
"
said
Rosa
,
pouting
,
as
she
recalled
their
epistolary
differences
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
is
the
meaning
that
I
attach
to
the
word
"
correspond
"
in
this
application
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
.
 
<EOS>
All
goes
well
,
time
works
on
,
and
at
this
next
Christmas
-
time
it
will
become
necessary
,
as
a
matter
of
form
,
to
give
the
exemplary
lady
in
the
corner
window
,
to
whom
we
are
so
much
indebted
,
business
notice
of
your
departure
in
the
ensuing
half
-
year
.
 
<EOS>
Your
relations
with
her
are
far
more
than
business
relations
,
no
doubt
;
but
a
residue
of
business
remains
in
them
,
and
business
is
business
ever
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
particularly
Angular
man
,
"
proceeded
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
if
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
to
mention
it
,
"
and
I
am
not
used
to
give
anything
away
.
 
<EOS>
If
,
for
these
two
reasons
,
some
competent
Proxy
would
give
YOU
away
,
I
should
take
it
very
kindly
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
intimated
,
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
,
that
she
thought
a
substitute
might
be
found
,
if
required
.
   
<EOS>
"
Surely
,
surely
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
For
instance
,
the
gentleman
who
teaches
Dancing
here
---
he
would
know
how
to
do
it
with
graceful
propriety
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
advance
and
retire
in
a
manner
satisfactory
to
the
feelings
of
the
officiating
clergyman
,
and
of
yourself
,
and
the
bridegroom
,
and
all
parties
concerned
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
---
I
am
a
particularly
Angular
man
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
screw
it
out
at
last
:
 
"
and
should
only
blunder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
sat
still
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
her
mind
had
not
got
quite
so
far
as
the
ceremony
yet
,
but
was
lagging
on
the
way
there
.
   
<EOS>
"
Memorandum
,
"
Will
.
"
 
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
referring
to
his
notes
,
disposing
of
"
Marriage
"
with
his
pencil
,
and
taking
a
paper
from
his
pocket
;
"
<EOS>
although
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
before
possessed
you
with
the
contents
of
your
father
's
will
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
right
at
this
time
to
leave
a
certified
copy
of
it
in
your
hands
.
 
<EOS>
And
although
Mr
Edwin
is
also
aware
of
its
contents
,
I
think
it
right
at
this
time
likewise
to
place
a
certified
copy
of
it
in
Mr
Jasper
's
hand
---
"
   
"
Not
in
his
own
!
"
<EOS>
asked
Rosa
,
looking
up
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Can
not
the
copy
go
to
Eddy
himself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
my
dear
,
if
you
particularly
wish
it
;
but
I
spoke
of
Mr
Jasper
as
being
his
trustee
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
particularly
wish
it
,
if
you
please
,
"
said
Rosa
,
hurriedly
and
earnestly
;
"
I
do
n't
like
Mr
Jasper
to
come
between
us
,
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
natural
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
that
your
young
husband
should
be
all
in
all
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
You
observe
that
I
say
,
I
suppose
.
 
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
I
am
a
particularly
Unnatural
man
,
and
I
do
n't
know
from
my
own
knowledge
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
looked
at
him
with
some
wonder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
"
he
explained
,
"
that
young
ways
were
never
my
ways
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
the
only
offspring
of
parents
far
advanced
in
life
,
and
I
half
believe
I
was
born
advanced
in
life
myself
.
 
<EOS>
No
personality
is
intended
towards
the
name
you
will
so
soon
change
,
when
I
remark
that
while
the
general
growth
of
people
seem
to
have
come
into
existence
,
buds
,
I
seem
to
have
come
into
existence
a
chip
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
a
chip
---
and
a
very
dry
one
---
when
I
first
became
aware
of
myself
.
<EOS>
Respecting
the
other
certified
copy
,
your
wish
shall
be
complied
with
.
 
<EOS>
Respecting
your
inheritance
,
I
think
you
know
all
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
an
annuity
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
The
savings
upon
that
annuity
,
and
some
other
items
to
your
credit
,
all
duly
carried
to
account
,
with
vouchers
,
will
place
you
in
possession
of
a
lump
-
sum
of
money
,
rather
exceeding
Seventeen
Hundred
Pounds
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
empowered
to
advance
the
cost
of
your
preparations
for
your
marriage
out
of
that
fund
.
 
<EOS>
All
is
told
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Will
you
please
tell
me
,
"
said
Rosa
,
taking
the
paper
with
a
prettily
knitted
brow
,
but
not
opening
it
:
 
<EOS>
"
whether
I
am
right
in
what
I
am
going
to
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
can
understand
what
you
tell
me
,
so
very
much
better
than
what
I

My
poor
papa
and
Eddy
's
father
made
their
agreement
together
,
as
very
dear
and
firm
and
fast
friends
,
in
order
that
we
,
too
,
might
be
very
dear
and
firm
and
fast
friends
after
them
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
.
"
   
"
<EOS>
For
the
lasting
good
of
both
of
us
,
and
the
lasting
happiness
of
both
of
us
?
"
   
"
Just
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
we
might
be
to
one
another
even
much
more
than
they
had
been
to
one
another
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
so
.

"
It
was
not
bound
upon
Eddy
,
and
it
was
not
bound
upon
me
,
by
any
forfeit
,
in
case
---
"
   
"
Do
n't
be
agitated
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
case
that
it
brings
tears
into
your
affectionate
eyes
even
to
picture
to
yourself
---
in
the
case
of
your
not
marrying
one
another
---
no
,
no
forfeiture
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
You
would
then
have
been
my
ward
until
you
were
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
No
worse
would
have
befallen
you
.
 
<EOS>
Bad
enough
perhaps
!

<EOS>

And
Eddy
?

<EOS>

He
would
have
come
into
his
partnership
derived
from
his
father
,
and
into
its
arrears
to
his
credit
(
if
any
)
,
on
attaining
his
majority
,
just

now

Rosa
,
with
her
perplexed
face
and
knitted
brow
,
bit
the
corner
of
her
attested
copy
,
as
she
sat
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
looking
abstractedly
on
the
floor
,
and
smoothing
it
with
her
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
<EOS>
this
betrothal
is
a
wish
,
a
sentiment
,
a
friendly
project
,
tenderly
expressed
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
That
it
was
strongly
felt
,
and
that
there
was
a
lively
hope
that
it
would
prosper
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
When
you
were
both
children
,
you
began
to
be
accustomed
to
it
,
and
it
HAS
prospered
.
 
<EOS>
But
circumstances
alter
cases
;
and
I
made
this
visit
to
-
day
,
partly
,
indeed
principally
,
to
discharge
myself
of
the
duty
of
telling
you
,
my
dear
,
that
two
young
people
can
only
be
betrothed
in
marriage
(
except
as
a
matter
of
convenience
,
and
therefore
mockery
and
misery
)
of
their
own
free
will
,
their
own
attachment
,
and
their
own
assurance
(
it
may
or
it
may
not
prove
a
mistaken
one
,
but
we
must
take
our
chance
of
that
)
,
that
they
are
suited
to
each
other
,
and
will
make
each
other
happy
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
to
be
supposed
,
for
example
,
that
if
either
of
your
fathers
were
living
now
,
and
had
any
mistrust
on
that
subject
,
his
mind
would
not
be
changed
by
the
change
of
circumstances
involved
in
the
change
of
your
years
?
<EOS>
Untenable
,
unreasonable
,
inconclusive
,
and
preposterous
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
said
all
this
,
as
if
he
were
reading
it
aloud
;
or
,
still
more
,
as
if
he
were
repeating
a
lesson
.
 
<EOS>
So
expressionless
of
any
approach
to
spontaneity
were
his
face
and
manner
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
,
my
dear

"
he
added
,
blurring
out
"
Will
"
with
his
pencil
,
"
discharged
myself
of
what
is
doubtless
a
formal
duty
in
this

still
a
duty
in
such
a
case

there
any

of
yours

I

<EOS>
Rosa
shook
her
head
,
with
an
almost
plaintive
air
of
hesitation
in
want
of
help
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
instruction
that
I
can
take
from
you
with
reference
to
your

<EOS>
"
I

I
should
like
to
settle
them
with
Eddy
first

Rosa
,
plaiting
the

in
her
dress
.
   
<EOS>
"
Surely

"
returned
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
two

Is
the

expected
shortly

has
gone
away
only
this

back

Nothing
could
happen
better

<EOS>
You
will
,
on
his
return
at
Christmas
,
arrange
all
matters
of
detail
with
him
;
you
will
then
communicate
with
me

I
will
discharge
myself
(

of
my

"
Could
I

"
said
Rosa
,
rising
,
as
he
jerked
out
of
his
chair
in
his
ungainly
way
:
 
"
could
I
ask
you
,
most
kindly
to
come
to
me
at
Christmas

if
I
had
anything
particular
to
say
to
you

"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
certainly

certainly

"
he
rejoined
;
apparently
---
if
such
a
word
can
be
used
of
one
who
had
no
apparent
lights
or
shadows
about
him
---
complimented
by
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
a
particularly
Angular
man
,
I
do
not
fit
smoothly
into
the
social
circle
,
and
consequently
I
have
no
other
engagement
at
Christmas
-
time
than
to
partake
,
on
the
twenty

fifth
,
of
a
boiled
turkey
and
celery
sauce
with
a

with
a
particularly
Angular

have
the
good
fortune
to
possess

being
a
Norfolk
farmer
,
sends
him
up
(
the
turkey
up
)
,
as
a
present
to
me
,
from
the
neighbourhood
of
Norwich
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
be
quite
proud
of
your
wishing

see
me

my

<EOS>
As

Receiver

so
very
few

DO
wish

see
me

that
the
novelty
would
be
bracing

"
   
<EOS>
For
his
ready
acquiescence
,
the
grateful
Rosa
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
,
stood
on
tiptoe
,
and
instantly
kissed
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord

cried
Mr

<EOS>

Miss
Twinkleton

I
have
had
a

"
Nay

rejoined
Miss

rising
with

condescension
:

not
incumbrance

<EOS>
Not

I

said
Mr

stammering
a
little
,
"
that
when
a
distinguished
visitor
(
not
that
I
am
one
:
 
far
from

)
goes
to
a
school
(
not
that
this
is
one
:
 
far
from

)
<EOS>
,
he
asks
for
a
holiday
,
or
some
sort
of
grace
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
now
the
afternoon
in
the
---
College
---
of
which
you
are
the
eminent
head
,
the
young
ladies
might
gain
nothing
,
except
in
name
,
by
having
the
rest
of
the
day
allowed
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
if
there
is
any
young
lady
at
all
under
a
cloud
,
might
I
solicit
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Mr
Grewgious

Mr
Grewgious

cried
Miss
Twinkleton
,
with
a
chastely
-
rallying
forefinger
.
 
<EOS>
"
O

Fie

<EOS>
But
as
Miss
Ferdinand
is
at
present
weighed
down
by
an
incubus
"
---
Miss
Twinkleton
might
have
said
a
pen
-
and
-
ink
-
ubus
of
writing
out
Monsieur
La
Fontaine
---
<EOS>
"
go
to
her
,
Rosa
my
dear
,
and
tell
her
the
penalty
is
remitted
,
in
deference
to
the
intercession
of
your
guardian
,
Mr
Grewgious
.
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
here
achieved
a
curtsey
,
suggestive
of
marvels
happening
to
her
respected
legs
,
and
which
she
came
out
of
nobly
,
three
yards
behind
her
starting
-
point
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
held
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
call
on
Mr
Jasper
before
leaving
Cloisterham
,
Mr
Grewgious
went
to
the
gatehouse
,
and
climbed
its
postern
stair
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Jasper
's
door
being
closed
,
and
presenting
on
a
slip
of
paper
the
word
"
Cathedral
,
"
the
fact
of
its
being
service
-
time
was
borne
into
the
mind
of
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
descended
the
stair
again
,
and
,
crossing
the
Close
,
paused
at
the
great
western
folding
-
door
of
the
Cathedral
,
which
stood
open
on
the
fine
and
bright
,
though
short
-
lived
,
afternoon
,
for
the
airing
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
peeping
in
<EOS>
,
"
it
's
like
looking
down
the
throat
of
Old
Time
.
"
   
<EOS>
Old
Time
heaved
a
mouldy
sigh
from
tomb
and
arch
and
vault
;
and
gloomy
shadows
began
to
deepen
in
corners
;
and
damps
began
to
rise
from
green
patches
of
stone
;
and
jewels
,
cast
upon
the
pavement
of
the
nave
from
stained
glass
by
the
declining
sun
,
began
to
perish
.
<EOS>
Within
the
grill
-
gate
of
the
chancel
,
up
the
steps
surmounted
loomingly
by
the
fast
-
darkening
organ
,
white
robes
could
be
dimly
seen
,
and
one
feeble
voice
,
rising
and
falling
in
a
cracked
,
monotonous
mutter
,
could
at
intervals
be
faintly
heard
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
free
outer
air
,
the
river
,
the
green
pastures
,
and
the
brown
arable
lands
,
the
teeming
hills
and
dales
,
were
reddened
by
the
sunset
:
while
the
distant
little
windows
in
windmills
and
farm
homesteads
,
shone
,
patches
of
bright
beaten
gold
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Cathedral
,
all
became
gray
,
murky
,
and
sepulchral
,
and
the
cracked
monotonous
mutter
went
on
like
a
dying
voice
,
until
the
organ
and
the
choir
burst
forth
,
and
drowned
it
in
a
sea
of
music
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
sea
fell
,
and
the
dying
voice
made
another
feeble
effort
,
and
then
the
sea
rose
high
,
and
beat
its
life
out
,
and
lashed
the
roof
,
and
surged
among
the
arches
,
and
pierced
the
heights
of
the
great
tower
;
and
then
the
sea
was
dry
,
and
all
was
still
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
had
by
that
time
walked
to
the
chancel
-
steps
,
where
he
met
the
living
waters
coming
out
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
is
the
matter
?
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
Jasper
accosted
him
,
rather
quickly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
been
sent
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
down
of
my
own
accord
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
my
pretty
ward
's
,
and
am
now
homeward
bound
again
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
found
her
thriving
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Blooming
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
Most
blooming
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
came
to
tell
her
,
seriously
,
what
a
betrothal
by
deceased
parents
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
is
it
---
according
to
your
judgment
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
noticed
the
whiteness
of
the
lips
that
asked
the
question
,
and
put
it
down
to
the
chilling
account
of
the
Cathedral
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
merely
came
to
tell
her
that
it
could
not
be
considered
binding
,
against
any
such
reason
for
its
dissolution
as
a
want
of
affection
,
or
want
of
disposition
to
carry
it
into
effect
,
on
the
side
of
either
party
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
,
had
you
any
especial
reason
for
telling
her
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
answered
somewhat
sharply
:
 
"
The
especial
reason
of
doing
my
duty
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
Simply
that
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
added
:
 
"
Come
,
Mr
Jasper
;
I
know
your
affection
for
your
nephew
,
and
that
you
are
quick
to
feel
on
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
I
assure
you
that
this
implies
not
the
least
doubt
of
,
or
disrespect
to
,
your
nephew
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
could
not
,
"
returned
Jasper
,
with
a
friendly
pressure
of
his
arm
,
as
they
walked
on
side
by
side
,
"
speak
more
handsomely
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
pulled
off
his
hat
to
smooth
his
head
,
and
,
having
smoothed
it
,
nodded
it
contentedly
,
and
put
his
hat
on
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
wager
,
"
said
Jasper
,
smiling
---
<EOS>
his
lips
were
still
so
white
that
he
was
conscious
of
it
,
and
bit
and
moistened
them
while
speaking
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
wager
that
she
hinted
no
wish
to
be
released
from
Ned
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
will
win
your
wager
,
if
you
do
,
"
retorted
Mr
Grewgious
.
<EOS>
"
We
should
allow
some
margin
for
little
maidenly
delicacies
in
a
young
motherless
creature
,
under
such
circumstances
,
I
suppose
;
it
is
not
in
my
line
;
what
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
Because
,
"
proceeded
Mr
Grewgious
,
who
had
all
this
time
very
knowingly
felt
his
way
round
to
action
on
his
remembrance
of
what
she
had
said
of
Jasper
himself
:
 
"
because
she
seems
to
have
some
little
delicate
instinct
that
all
preliminary
arrangements
had
best
be
made
between
Mr
Edwin
Drood
and
herself
,
do
n't
you
see
?
 
<EOS>
She
do
n't
want
us
,
<EOS>
do
n't
you
know
?
<EOS>
"
   
Jasper
touched
himself
on
the
breast
,
and
said
,
somewhat
indistinctly
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
mean
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
touched
himself
on
the
breast
,
and
said
:
 
"
I
mean
us
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
let
them
have
their
little
discussions
and
councils
together
,
when
Mr
Edwin
Drood
comes
back
here
at
Christmas
;
and
then
you
and
I
will
step
in
,
and
put
the
final
touches
to
the
business
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
"
So
,
you
settled
with
her
that
you
would
come
back
at
Christmas
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
see
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
you
quite
fairly
said
just
now
,
there
is
such
an
exceptional
attachment
between
my
nephew
and
me
,
that
I
am
more
sensitive
for
the
dear
,
fortunate
,
happy
,
happy
fellow
than
for
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
only
right
that
the
young
lady
should
be
considered
,
as
you
have
pointed
out
,
and
that
I
should
accept
my
cue
from
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
accept
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
that
at
Christmas
they
will
complete
their
preparations
for
May
,
and
that
their
marriage
will
be
put
in
final
train
by
themselves
,
and
that
nothing
will
remain
for
us
but
to
put
ourselves
in
train
also
,
and
have
everything
ready
for
our
formal
release
from
our
trusts
,
on
Edwin
's
birthday
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
my
understanding
,
"
assented
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
they
shook
hands
to
part
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
bless
them
both
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
save
them
both
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jasper
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
bless
them
,
"
remarked
the
former
,
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
save
them
,
"
returned
the
latter
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
there
any
difference
?

Chapter
10
.
<EOS>
Smoothing
the
way
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
often
enough
remarked
that
women
have
a
curious
power
of
divining
the
characters
of
men
,
which
would
seem
to
be
innate
and
instinctive
;
seeing
that
it
is
arrived
at
through
no
patient
process
of
reasoning
,
that
it
can
give
no
satisfactory
or
sufficient
account
of
itself
,
and
that
it
pronounces
in
the
most
confident
manner
even
against
accumulated
observation
on
the
part
of
the
other
sex
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
has
not
been
quite
so
often
remarked
that
this
power
(
fallible
,
like
every
other
human
attribute
)
is
for
the
most
part
absolutely
incapable
of
self
-
revision
;
and
that
when
it
has
delivered
an
adverse
opinion
which
by
all
human
lights
is
subsequently
proved
to
have
failed
,
it
is
undistinguishable
from
prejudice
,
in
respect
of
its
determination
not
to
be
corrected
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
very
possibility
of
contradiction
or
disproof
,
however
remote
,
communicates
to
this
feminine
judgment
from
the
first
,
in
nine
cases
out
of
ten
,
the
weakness
attendant
on
the
testimony
of
an
interested
witness
;
so
personally
and
strongly
does
the
fair
diviner
connect
herself
with
her
divination
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
do
n't
you
think
,
Ma
dear
,
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
to
his
mother
one
day
as
she
sat
at
her
knitting
in
his
little
book
-
room
,
"
that
you
are
rather
hard
on
Mr
Neville
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
do
NOT
,
Sept
,
"
returned
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
discuss
it
,
Ma
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
objection
to
discuss
it
,
Sept.
 
<EOS>
I
trust
,
my
dear
,
I
am
always
open
to
discussion
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
vibration
in
the
old
lady
's
cap
,
as
though
she
internally
added
:
 
"
<EOS>
and
I
should
like
to
see
the
discussion
that
would
change
MY
mind
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
,
Ma
,
"
said
her
conciliatory
son
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
nothing
like
being
open
to
discussion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
not
,
my
dear
,
"
returned
the
old
lady
,
evidently
shut
to
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
,
on
that
unfortunate
occasion
,
commits
himself
under
provocation
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
under
mulled
wine
,
"
added
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
admit
the
wine
.
 
<EOS>
Though
I
believe
the
two
young
men
were
much
alike
in
that
regard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
not
,
Ma
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
I
DON'T
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
 
<EOS>
"
Still
,
I
am
quite
open
to
discussion
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Ma
,
I
can
not
see
how
we
are
to
discuss
,
if
you
take
that
line
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Blame
Mr
Neville
for
it
,
Sept
,
and
not
me
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
with
stately
severity
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Ma
!
<EOS>
why
Mr
Neville
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
Mrs
Crisparkle
,
retiring
on
first
principles
,
"
he
came
home
intoxicated
,
and
did
great
discredit
to
this
house
,
and
showed
great
disrespect
to
this
family
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
not
to
be
denied
,
Ma
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
,
and
he
is
now
,
very
sorry
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
for
Mr
Jasper
's
well
-
bred
consideration
in
coming
up
to
me
,
next
day
,
after
service
,
in
the
Nave
itself
,
with
his
gown
still
on
,
and
expressing
his
hope
that
I
had
not
been
greatly
alarmed
or
had
my
rest
violently
broken
,
I
believe
I
might
never
have
heard
of
that
disgraceful
transaction
,
"
said
the
old
lady
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
candid
,
Ma
,
I
think
I
should
have
kept
it
from
you
if
I
could
:
 
though
I
had
not
decidedly
made
up
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
following
Jasper
out
,
to
confer
with
him
on
the
subject
,
and
to
consider
the
expediency
of
his
and
my
jointly
hushing
the
thing
up
on
all
accounts
,
when
I
found
him
speaking
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Then
it
was
too
late
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Too
late
,
indeed
,
Sept.
 
He
was
still
as
pale
as
gentlemanly
ashes
at
what
had
taken
place
in
his
rooms
overnight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
HAD
kept
it
from
you
,
Ma
,
you
may
be
sure
it
would
have
been
for
your
peace
and
quiet
,
and
for
the
good
of
the
young
men
,
and
in
my
best
discharge
of
my
duty
according
to
my
lights
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
old
lady
immediately
walked
across
the
room
and
kissed
him
:
saying
,
"
Of
course
,
my
dear
Sept
,
I
am
sure
of
that
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
it
became
the
town
-
talk
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
rubbing
his
ear
,
as
his
mother
resumed
her
seat
,
and
her
knitting
,
"
and
passed
out
of
my
power
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
said
then
,
Sept
,
"
returned
the
old
lady
,
"
<EOS>
that
I
thought
ill
of
Mr
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
say
now
,
that
I
think
ill
of
Mr
Neville
.
<EOS>
And
I
said
then
,
and
I
say
now
,
that
I
hope
Mr
Neville
may
come
to
good
,
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
will
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
cap
vibrated
again
considerably
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
hear
you
say
so
,
Ma
---
"
   
"
I
am
sorry
to
say
so
,
my
dear
,
"
interposed
the
old
lady
,
knitting
on
firmly
,
"
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
---
For
,
"
pursued
the
Minor
Canon
,
"
it
is
undeniable
that
Mr
Neville
is
exceedingly
industrious
and
attentive
,
and
that
he
improves
apace
,
and
that
he
has
---
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
say
---
an
attachment
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
merit
in
the
last
article
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
quickly
;
"
and
if
he
says
there
is
,
I
think
the
worse
of
him
for
the
boast
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
,
my
dear
Ma
,
he
never
said
there
was
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
,
"
returned
the
old
lady
;
"
still
,
I
do
n't
see
that
it
greatly
signifies
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
impatience
in
the
pleasant
look
with
which
Mr
Crisparkle
contemplated
the
pretty
old
piece
of
china
as
it
knitted
;
but
there
was
,
certainly
,
a
humorous
sense
of
its
not
being
a
piece
of
china
to
argue
with
very
closely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Besides
,
Sept
,
ask
yourself
what
he
would
be
without
his
sister
.
<EOS>
You
know
what
an
influence
she
has
over
him
;
you
know
what
a
capacity
she
has
;
you
know
that
whatever
he
reads
with
you
,
he
reads
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
Give
her
her
fair
share
of
your
praise
,
and
how
much
do
you
leave
for
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
At
these
words
Mr
Crisparkle
fell
into
a
little
reverie
,
in
which
he
thought
of
several
things
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
times
he
had
seen
the
brother
and
sister
together
in
deep
converse
over
one
of
his
own
old
college
books
;
now
,
in
the
rimy
mornings
,
when
he
made
those
sharpening
pilgrimages
to
Cloisterham
Weir
;
now
,
in
the
sombre
evenings
,
when
he
faced
the
wind
at
sunset
,
having
climbed
his
favourite
outlook
,
a
beetling
fragment
of
monastery
ruin
;
and
the
two
studious
figures
passed
below
him
along
the
margin
of
the
river
,
in
which
the
town
fires
and
lights
already
shone
,
making
the
landscape
bleaker
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
how
the
consciousness
had
stolen
upon
him
that
in
teaching
one
,
he
was
teaching
two
;
and
how
he
had
almost
insensibly
adapted
his
explanations
to
both
minds
---
that
with
which
his
own
was
daily
in
contact
,
and
that
which
he
only
approached
through
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
gossip
that
had
reached
him
from
the
Nuns
'
House
,
to
the
effect
that
Helena
,
whom
he
had
mistrusted
as
so
proud
and
fierce
,
submitted
herself
to
the
fairy
-
bride
(
as
he
called
her
)
,
and
learnt
from
her
what
she
knew
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
of
the
picturesque
alliance
between
those
two
,
externally
so
very
different
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
---
perhaps
most
of
all
---
could
it
be
that
these
things
were
yet
<EOS>
but
so
many
weeks
old
,
and
had
become
an
integral
part
of
his
life
?
   
<EOS>
As
,
whenever
the
Reverend
Septimus
fell
a
-
musing
,
his
good
mother
took
it
to
be
an
infallible
sign
that
he
"
wanted
support
,
"
the
blooming
old
lady
made
all
haste
to
the
dining
-
room
closet
,
to
produce
from
it
the
support
embodied
in
a
glass
of
Constantia
and
a
home
-
made
biscuit
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
most
wonderful
closet
,
worthy
of
Cloisterham
and
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
.
 
<EOS>
Above
it
,
a
portrait
of
Handel
in
a
flowing
wig
beamed
down
at
the
spectator
,
with
a
knowing
air
of
being
up
to
the
contents
of
the
closet
,
and
a
musical
air
of
intending
to
combine
all
its
harmonies
in
one
delicious
fugue
.
 
<EOS>
No
common
closet
with
a
vulgar
door
on
hinges
,
openable
all
at
once
,
and
leaving
nothing
to
be
disclosed
by
degrees
,
this
rare
closet
had
a
lock
in
mid
-
air
,
where
two
perpendicular
slides
met
;
the
one
falling
down
,
and
the
other
pushing
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
upper
slide
,
on
being
pulled
down
(
leaving
the
lower
a
double
mystery
)
,
revealed
deep
shelves
of
pickle
-
jars
,
jam
-
pots
,
tin
canisters
,
spice
-
boxes
,
and
agreeably
outlandish
vessels
of
blue
and
white
,
the
luscious
lodgings
of
preserved
tamarinds
and
ginger
.
 
<EOS>
Every
benevolent
inhabitant
of
this
retreat
had
his
name
inscribed
upon
his
stomach
.
 
<EOS>
The
pickles
,
in
a
uniform
of
rich
brown
double
-
breasted
buttoned
coat
,
and
yellow
or
sombre
drab
continuations
,
announced
their
portly
forms
,
in
printed
capitals
,
as
Walnut
,
Gherkin
,
Onion
,
Cabbage
,
Cauliflower
,
Mixed
,
and
other
members
of
that
noble
family
.
 
<EOS>
The
jams
,
as
being
of
a
less
masculine
temperament
,
and
as
wearing
curlpapers
,
announced
themselves
in
feminine
caligraphy
,
like
a
soft
whisper
,
to
be
Raspberry
,
Gooseberry
,
Apricot
,
Plum
,
Damson
,
Apple
,
and
Peach
.
<EOS>
The
scene
closing
on
these
charmers
,
and
the
lower
slide
ascending
,
oranges
were
revealed
,
attended
by
a
mighty
japanned
sugar

box
,
to
temper
their
acerbity
if
unripe

Home

made

waited
at
the
Court
of
these

,
accompanied
by
a
goodly
fragment
of
plum

cake
,
and
various
slender
ladies
'
fingers
,
to
be
dipped
into
sweet
wine
and
kissed
.
 
<EOS>
Lowest
of
all
,
a
compact
leaden

vault
enshrined
the
sweet
wine
and
a
stock
of
cordials
:

whence
issued
whispers

There
was
a
crowning
air
upon
this
closet
of
closets
,
of
having
been
for
ages
hummed
through
by
the
Cathedral
bell
and
organ
,
until
those
venerable
bees
had
made
sublimated
honey
of
everything
in
store
;
and
it
was
always
observed
that
every
dipper
among
the
shelves
(
deep
,
as
has
been
noticed
,
and
swallowing
up
head
,
shoulders
,
and
elbows
)
came
forth
again
mellow
-
faced
,
and
seeming
to
have
undergone
a
saccharine
transfiguration
.
   
<EOS>
The
Reverend
Septimus
yielded
himself
up
quite
as
willing
a
victim
to
a
nauseous
medicinal
herb
-
closet
,
also
presided
over
by
the
china
shepherdess
,
as
to
this
glorious
cupboard
.
 
<EOS>
To
what
amazing
infusions
of
gentian
,
peppermint
,
gilliflower
,
sage
,
parsley
,
thyme
,
rue
,
rosemary
,
and
dandelion
,
did
his
courageous
stomach
submit
itself
!
 
<EOS>
In
what
wonderful
wrappers
,
enclosing
layers
of
dried
leaves
,
would
he
swathe
his
rosy
and
contented
face
,
if
his
mother
suspected
him
of
a
toothache
!
 
<EOS>
What
botanical
blotches
would
he
cheerfully
stick
upon
his
cheek
,
or
forehead
,
if
the
dear
old
lady
convicted
him
of
an
imperceptible
pimple
there
!
 
<EOS>
Into
this
herbaceous
penitentiary
,
situated
on
an
upper
staircase
-
landing
:
 
a
low
and
narrow
whitewashed
cell
,
where
bunches
of
dried
leaves
hung
from
rusty
hooks
in
the
ceiling
,
and
were
spread
out
upon
shelves
,
in
company
with
portentous
bottles
:
 
would
the
Reverend
Septimus
submissively
be
led
,
like
the
highly
popular
lamb
who
has
so
long
and
unresistingly
been
led
to
the
slaughter
,
and
there
would
he
,
unlike
that
lamb
,
bore
nobody
but
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Not
even
doing
that
much
,
so
that
the
old
lady
were
busy
and
pleased
,
he
would
quietly
swallow
what
was
given
him
,
merely
taking
a
corrective
dip
of
hands
and
face
into
the
great
bowl
of
dried
rose
-
leaves
,
and
into
the
other
great
bowl
of
dried
lavender
,
and
then
would
go
out
,
as
confident
in
the
sweetening
powers
of
Cloisterham
Weir
and
a
wholesome
mind
,
as
Lady
Macbeth
was
hopeless
of
those
of
all
the
seas
that
roll
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
present
instance
the
good
Minor
Canon
took
his
glass
of
Constantia
with
an
excellent
grace
,
and
,
so
supported
to
his
mother
's
satisfaction
,
applied
himself
to
the
remaining
duties
of
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
In
their
orderly
and
punctual
progress
they
brought
round
Vesper
Service
and
twilight
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cathedral
being
very
cold
,
he
set
off
for
a
brisk
trot
after
service
;
the
trot
to
end
in
a
charge
at
his
favourite
fragment
of
ruin
,
which
was
to
be
carried
by
storm
,
without
a
pause
for
breath
.
   
<EOS>
He
carried
it
in
a
masterly
manner
,
and
,
not
breathed
even
then
,
stood
looking
down
upon
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
The
river
at
Cloisterham
is
sufficiently
near
the
sea
to
throw
up
oftentimes
a
quantity
of
seaweed
.
 
<EOS>
An
unusual
quantity
had
come
in
with
the
last
tide
,
and
this
,
and
the
confusion
of
the
water
,
and
the
restless
dipping
and
flapping
of
the
noisy
gulls
,
and
an
angry
light
out
seaward
beyond
the
brown
-
sailed
barges
that
were
turning
black
,
foreshadowed
a
stormy
night
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
mind
he
was
contrasting
the
wild
and
noisy
sea
with
the
quiet
harbour
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
when
Helena
and
Neville
Landless
passed
below
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
the
two
together
in
his
thoughts
all
day
,
and
at
once
climbed
down
to
speak
to
them
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
footing
was
rough
in
an
uncertain
light
for
any
tread
save
that
of
a
good
climber
;
but
the
Minor
Canon
was
as
good
a
climber
as
most
men
,
and
stood
beside
them
before
many
good
climbers
would
have
been
half
-
way
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
wild
evening
,
Miss
Landless
!
 
<EOS>
Do
you
not
find
your
usual
walk
with
<EOS>
your
brother
too
exposed
and
cold
for
the
time
of
year
?
 
<EOS>
Or
at
all
events
,
when
the
sun
is
down
,
and
<EOS>
the
weather
is
driving
in
from
the
sea
?
"
   
<EOS>
Helena
thought
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
their
favourite
walk
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
retired
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
retired
,
"
assented
Mr
Crisparkle
,
laying
hold
of
his
opportunity
straightway
,
and
walking
on
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
place
of
all
others
where
one
can
speak
without
interruption
,
as
I
wish
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
,
I
believe
you
tell
your
sister
everything
that
passes
between
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everything
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Consequently
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
<EOS>
your
sister
is
aware
that
I
have
repeatedly
urged
you
to
make
some
kind
of
apology
for
that
unfortunate
occurrence
which
befell
on
the
night
of
your
arrival
here
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
saying
it
he
looked
to
her
,
and
not
to
him
;
therefore
it
was
she
,
and
not
he
,
who
replied
:
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
call
it
unfortunate
,
Miss
Helena
,
"
resumed
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
forasmuch
as
it
certainly
has
engendered
a
prejudice
against
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
notion
about
,
that
he
is
a
dangerously
passionate
fellow
,
of
an
uncontrollable
and
furious
temper
:
 
<EOS>
he
is
really
avoided
as
such
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
he
is
,
poor
fellow
,
"
said
Helena
,
with
a
look
of
proud
compassion
at
her
brother
,
expressing
a
deep
sense
of
his
being
ungenerously
treated
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
quite
sure
of
it
,
from
your
saying
so
;
but
what
you
tell
me
is
confirmed
by
suppressed
hints
and
references
that
I
meet
with
every
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
Mr
Crisparkle
again
resumed
,
in
a
tone
of
mild
though
firm
persuasion
,
"
is
not
this
to
be
regretted
,
and
ought
it
not
to
be
amended
?
 
<EOS>
These
are
early
days
of
Neville
's
in
Cloisterham
,
and
I
have
no
fear
of
his
outliving
such
a
prejudice
,
and
proving
himself
to
have
been
misunderstood
.
 
<EOS>
But
how
much
wiser
to
take
action
at
once
,
than
to
trust
to
uncertain
time
!
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
apart
from
its
being
politic
,
it
is
right
.
 
<EOS>
For
there
can
be
no
question
that
Neville
was
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
provoked
,
"
Helena
submitted
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
was
the
assailant
,
"
Mr
Crisparkle
submitted
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
in
silence
,
until
Helena
raised
her
eyes
to
the
Minor
Canon
's
face
,
and
said
,
almost
reproachfully
:
 
"
<EOS>
O
Mr
Crisparkle
,
would
you
have
<EOS>
Neville
throw
himself
at
young
Drood
's
feet
,
or
at
Mr
Jasper
's
,
who
maligns
him
every
day
?
 
<EOS>
In
your
heart
you
can
not
mean
it
.
 
<EOS>
From
your
heart
you
could
not
do
it
,
if
his
case
were
yours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
represented
to
Mr
Crisparkle
,
Helena
,
"
said
Neville
,
with
a
glance
of
deference
towards
his
tutor
,
"
that
if
I
could
do
it
from
my
heart
,
I
would
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
,
and
I
revolt
from
the
pretence
.
 
<EOS>
You
forget
however
,
that
to
put
the
case
to
Mr
Crisparkle
as
his
own
,
is
to
 
suppose
to
have
done
what
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
his
pardon
,
"
said
Helena
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
"
remarked
Mr
Crisparkle
,
again
laying
hold
of
his
opportunity
,
<EOS>
though
with
a
moderate
and
delicate
touch
,
"
you
both
instinctively
acknowledge
that
Neville
did
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
Then
why
stop
short
,
and
not
otherwise
acknowledge
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
no
difference
,
"
asked
Helena
,
with
a
little
faltering
in
her
manner
;
"
between
submission
to
a
generous
spirit
,
and
submission
to
a
base
or
trivial
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
Before
the
worthy
Minor
Canon
was
quite
ready
with
his
argument
in
reference
to
this
nice
distinction
,
Neville
struck
in
:
   
<EOS>
"
Help
me
to
clear
myself
with
Mr
Crisparkle
,
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
Help
me
to
convince
him
that
I
can
not
be
the
first
to
make
concessions
without
mockery
and
falsehood
.
 
<EOS>
My
nature
must
be
changed
before
I
can
do
so
,
and
it
is
not
changed
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sensible
of
inexpressible
affront
,
and
deliberate
aggravation
of
inexpressible
affront
,
and
I
am
angry
.
 
<EOS>
The
plain
truth
is
,
I
am
still
as
angry
when
I
recall
that
night
as
I
was
that
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Neville
,
"
hinted
the
Minor
Canon
,
with
a
steady
countenance
,
"
you
have
repeated
that
former
action
of
your
hands
,
which
I
so
much
dislike
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
sir
,
but
it
was
involuntary
.
 
<EOS>
I
confessed
that
I
was
still
as
angry
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
confess
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
that
I
hoped
for
better
things
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
disappoint
you
,
sir
,
but
it
would
be
far
worse
to
deceive
you
,
and
I
should
deceive
you
grossly
if
I
pretended
that
you
had
softened
me
in
this
respect
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
may
come
when
your
powerful
influence
will
do
even
that
with
the
difficult
pupil
whose
antecedents
you
know
;
but
it
has
not
come
yet
.
 
<EOS>
Is
this
so
,
and
in
spite
of
my
struggles
against
myself
,
Helena
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
,
whose
dark
eyes
were
watching
the
effect
of
what
he
said
on
Mr
Crisparkle
's
face
,
replied
---
to
Mr
Crisparkle
,
not
to
him
:
"
It
is
so
.
"
 
<EOS>
After
a
short
pause
,
she
answered
the
slightest
look
of
inquiry
conceivable
,
in
her
brother
's
eyes
,
with
as
slight
an
affirmative
bend
of
her
own
head
;
and
he
went
on
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
yet
had
the
courage
to
say
to
you
,
sir
,
what
in
full
openness
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
said
when
you
first
talked
with
me
on
this
subject
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
easy
to
say
,
and
I
have
been
withheld
by
a
fear
of
its
seeming
ridiculous
,
which
is
very
strong
upon
me
down
to
this
last
moment
,
and
might
,
but
for
my
sister
,
prevent
my
being
quite
open
with
you
even
now
.
<EOS>
---
I
admire
Miss
Bud
,
sir
,
so
very
much
,
that
I
can
not
bear
her
being
treated
with
conceit
or
indifference
;
and
<EOS>
even
if
I
did
not
feel
that
I
had
an
injury
against
young
Drood
on
my
own
account
,
I
should
feel
that
I
had
an
injury
against
him
on
hers
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
in
utter
amazement
,
looked
at
Helena
for
corroboration
,
and
met
in
her
expressive
face
full
corroboration
,
and
a
plea
for
advice
.
   
<EOS>
"
The
young
lady
of
whom
you
speak
is
,
as
you
know
,
Mr
Neville
,
shortly
to
be
married
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
gravely
;
"
therefore
your
admiration
,
if
it
be
of
that
special
nature
which
you
seem
to
indicate
,
is
outrageously
misplaced
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
is
monstrous
that
you
should
take
upon
yourself
to
be
the
young
lady
's
champion
against
her
chosen
husband
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
you
have
seen
them
only
once
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
has
become
your
sister
's
friend
;
and
I
wonder
that
your
sister
,
even
on
her
behalf
,
has
not
checked
you
in
this
irrational
and
culpable
fancy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
She
has
tried
,
sir
,
but
uselessly
.
 
<EOS>
Husband
or
no
husband
,
that
fellow
is
incapable
of
the
feeling
with
which
I
am
inspired
towards
the
beautiful
young
creature
whom
he
treats
like
a
doll
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
he
is
as
incapable
of
it
,
as
he
is
unworthy
of
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
she
is
sacrificed
in
being
bestowed
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
say
that
I
love
her
,
and
despise
and
hate
him
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
with
a
face
so
flushed
,
and
a
gesture
so
violent
,
that
his
sister
crossed
to
his
side
,
and
caught
his
arm
,
remonstrating
,
"
Neville
,
Neville
!
"
   
<EOS>
Thus
recalled
to
himself
,
he
quickly
became
sensible
of
having
lost
the
guard
he
had
set
upon
his
passionate
tendency
,
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
,
as
one
repentant
and
wretched
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
watching
him
attentively
,
and
at
the
same
time
meditating
how
to
proceed
,
walked
on
for
some
paces
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
he
spoke
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
,
Mr
Neville
,
I
am
sorely
grieved
to
see
in
you
more
traces
of
a
character
as
sullen
,
angry
,
and
wild
,
as
the
night
now
closing
in
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
of
too
serious
an
aspect
to
leave
me
the
resource
of
treating
the
infatuation
you
have
disclosed
,
as
undeserving
serious
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
I
give
it
very
serious
consideration
,
and
I
speak
to
you
accordingly
.
 
<EOS>
This
feud
between
you
and
young
Drood
must
not
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
permit
it
to
go
on
any
longer
,
knowing
what
I
now
know
from
you
,
and
you
living
under
my
roof
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
prejudiced
and
unauthorised
constructions
your
blind
and
envious
wrath
may
put
upon
his
character
,
it
is
a
frank
,
good
-
natured
character
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
can
trust
to
it
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
pray
observe
what
I
am
about
to
say
.
 
<EOS>
On
reflection
,
and
on
your
sister
's
representation
,
I
am
willing
to
admit
that
,
in
making
peace
with
young
Drood
,
you
have
a
right
to
be
met
half
-
way
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
engage
that
you
shall
be
,
and
even
that
young
Drood
shall
make
the
first
advance
.
 
<EOS>
This
condition
fulfilled
,
you
will
pledge
me
the
honour
of
a
Christian
gentleman
that
the
quarrel
is
for
ever
at
an
end
on
your
side
.
 
<EOS>
What
may
be
in
your
heart
when
you
give
him
your
hand
,
can
only
be
known
to
the
Searcher
of
all
hearts
;
but
it
will
never
go
well
with
you
,
if
there
be
any
treachery
there
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
,
as
to
that
;
next
as
to
what
I
must
again
speak
of
as
your
infatuation
.
 
<EOS>
I
understand
it
to
have
been
confided
to
me
,
and
to
be
known
to
no
other
person
<EOS>
save
your
sister
and
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Do
I
understand
aright
?
"
   
<EOS>
Helena
answered
in
a
low
voice
:
 
"
It
is
only
known
to
us
three
who
are
here
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
at
all
known
to
the
young
lady
,
your
friend
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
no
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
require
you
,
then
,
to
give
me
your
similar
and
solemn
pledge
,
Mr
Neville
,
that
it
shall
remain
the
secret
it
is
,
and
that
you
will
take
no
other
action
whatsoever
upon
it
than
endeavouring
(
and
that
most
earnestly
)
to
erase
it
from
your
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
tell
you
that
it
will
soon
pass
;
I
will
not
tell
you
that
it
is
the
fancy
of
the
moment
;
I
will
not
tell
you
that
such
caprices
have
their
rise
and
fall
among
the
young
and
ardent
every
hour
;
I
will
leave
you
undisturbed
in
the
belief
that
it
has
few
parallels
or
none
,
that
it
will
abide
with
you
a
long
time
,
and
that
it
will
be
very
difficult
to
conquer
.
 
<EOS>
So
much
the
more
weight
shall
I
attach
to
the
pledge
I
require
from
you
,
when
it
is
unreservedly
given
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
twice
or
thrice
essayed
to
speak
,
but
failed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
leave
you
with
your
sister
,
whom
it
is
time
you
took
home
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
me
alone
in
my
room
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
not
leave
us
yet
,
"
Helena
implored
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Another
minute
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
,
"
said
Neville
,
pressing
his
hand
upon
his
face
,
"
have
needed
so
much
as
another
minute
,
if
you
had
been
less
patient
with
me
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
less
considerate
of
me
,
and
less
unpretendingly
good
and
true
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
if
in
my
childhood
I
had
known
such
a
guide
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Follow
your
guide
now
,
Neville
,
"
murmured
Helena
,
"
and
follow
him
to
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
was
that
in
her
tone
which
broke
the
good
Minor
Canon
's
voice
,
or
it
would
have
repudiated
her
exaltation
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
laid
a
finger
on
his
lips
,
and
looked
towards
her
brother
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
say
that
I
give
both
pledges
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
out
of
my
innermost
heart
,
and
to
say
that
there
is
no
treachery
in
it
,
is
to
say
nothing
!
"
 
<EOS>
Thus
Neville
,
greatly
moved
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
forgiveness
for
my
miserable
lapse
into
a
burst
of
passion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
mine
,
Neville
,
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
with
whom
forgiveness
lies
,
as
the
highest
attribute
conceivable
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Helena
,
you
and
your
brother
are
twin
children
.
 
<EOS>
You
came
into
this
world
with
the
same
dispositions
,
and
you
passed
your
younger
days
together
surrounded
by
the
same
adverse
circumstances
.
 
<EOS>
What
you
have
overcome
in
yourself
,
can
you
not
overcome
in
him
?
 
<EOS>
You
see
the
rock
that
lies
in
his
course
.
 
<EOS>
Who
<EOS>
but
you
can
keep
him
clear
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
but
you
,
sir
?
"
replied
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
my
influence
,
or
my
weak
wisdom
,
compared
with
yours
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
wisdom
of
Love
,
"
returned
the
Minor
Canon
,
"
and
it
was
the
highest
wisdom
ever
known
upon
this
earth
,
remember
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
mine
---
but
the
less
said
of
that
commonplace
commodity
the
better
.
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
took
the
hand
he
offered
her
,
and
gratefully
and
almost
reverently
raised
it
to
her
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
Tut
!
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
softly
,
"
I
am
much
overpaid
!
"
and
turned
away
.
   
<EOS>
Retracing
his
steps
towards
the
Cathedral
Close
,
he
tried
,
as
he
went
along
in
the
dark
,
to
think
out
the
best
means
of
bringing
to
pass
what
he
had
promised
to
effect
,
and
what
must
somehow
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
probably
be
asked
to
marry
them
,
"
he
reflected
,
"
and
I
would
they
were
married
and
gone
!
 
<EOS>
But
this
presses
first
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
debated
principally
whether
he
should
write
to
young
Drood
,
or
whether
he
should
speak
to
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
The
consciousness
of
being
popular
with
the
whole
Cathedral
establishment
inclined
him
to
the
latter
course
,
and
the
well
-
timed
sight
of
the
lighted
gatehouse
decided
him
to
take
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
strike
while
the
iron
is
hot
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
see
him
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
was
lying
asleep
on
a
couch
before
the
fire
,
when
,
having
ascended
the
postern
-
stair
,
and
received
no
answer
to
his
knock
at
the
door
,
Mr
Crisparkle
gently
turned
the
handle
and
looked
in
.
<EOS>
Long
afterwards
he
had
cause
to
remember
how
Jasper
sprang
from
the
couch
in
a
delirious
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
,
and
crying
out
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
Who
did
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
I
,
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
glare
of
his
eyes
settled
down
into
a
look
of
recognition
,
and
he
moved
a
chair
or
two
,
to
make
a
way
to
the
fireside
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
dreaming
at
a
great
rate
,
and
am
glad
to
be
disturbed
from
an
indigestive
after
-
dinner
sleep
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
mention
that
you
are
always
welcome
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
confident
,
"
returned
Mr
Crisparkle
,
as
he
sat
himself
down
in
the
easy
-
chair
placed
for
him
,
"
that
my
subject
will
at
first
sight
be
quite
as
welcome
as
myself
;
but
I
am
a
minister
of
peace
,
and
I
pursue
my
subject
in
the
interests
of
peace
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
Jasper
,
I
want
to
establish
peace
between
these
two
young
fellows
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
very
perplexed
expression
took
hold
of
Mr
Jasper
's
face
;
a
very
perplexing
expression
too
,
for
Mr
Crisparkle
could
make
nothing
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
was
Jasper
's
inquiry
,
in
a
low
and
slow
voice
,
after
a
silence
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
the
"
How
"
I
come
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
want
to
ask
you
to
do
me
the
great
favour
and
service
of
interposing
with
your
nephew
<EOS>
(
I
have
already
interposed
with
Mr
Neville
)
,
and
getting
him
to
write
you
a
short
note
,
in
his
lively
way
,
saying
that
he
is
willing
to
shake
hands
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
a
good
-
natured
fellow
he
is
,
and
what
influence
you
have
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
without
in
the
least
defending
Mr
Neville
,
we
must
all
admit
that
he
was
bitterly
stung
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
turned
that
perplexed
face
towards
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
continuing
to
observe
it
,
found
it
even
more
perplexing
than
before
,
inasmuch
as
it
seemed
to
denote
<EOS>
(
which
could
hardly
be
)
<EOS>
some
close
internal
calculation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
you
are
not
prepossessed
in
Mr
Neville
's
favour
,
"
the
Minor
Canon
was
going
on
,
when
Jasper
stopped
him
:
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
cause
to
say
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
;
and
I
admit
his
lamentable
violence
of
temper
,
though
I
hope
he
and
I
will
get
the
better
of
it
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
exacted
a
very
solemn
promise
from
him
as
to
his
future
demeanour
towards
your
nephew
,
if
you
do
kindly
interpose
;
and
I
am
sure
he
will
keep
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
always
responsible
and
trustworthy
,
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
really
feel
sure
that
you
can
answer
for
him
so
confidently
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
perplexed
and
perplexing
look
vanished
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
you
relieve
my
mind
of
a
great
dread
,
and
a
heavy
weight
,
"
said
Jasper
;
"
I
will
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
delighted
by
the
swiftness
and
completeness
of
his
success
,
acknowledged
it
in
the
handsomest
terms
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
it
,
"
repeated
Jasper
,
"
for
the
comfort
of
having
your
guarantee
against
my
vague
and
unfounded
fears
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
laugh
---
but
do
you
keep
a
Diary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
line
for
a
day
;
not
more
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
line
for
a
day
would
be
quite
as
much
as
my
uneventful
life
would
need
,
Heaven
knows
,
"
said
Jasper
,
taking
a
book
from
a
desk
,
"
but
that
my
Diary
is
,
in
fact
,
a
Diary
of
Ned
's
life
too
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
laugh
at
this
entry
;
you
will
guess
when
it
was
made
:
   
"
<EOS>
"
Past
midnight
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
After
what
I
have
just
now
seen
,
I
have
a
morbid
dread
upon
me
of
some
horrible
consequences
resulting
to
my
dear
boy
,
that
I
can
not
reason
with
or
in
any
way
contend
against
.
 
<EOS>
All
my
efforts
are
vain
.
 
<EOS>
The
demoniacal
passion
of
this
Neville
Landless
,
his
strength
in
his
fury
,
and
his
savage
rage
for
the
destruction
of
its
object
,
appal
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
profound
is
the
impression
,
that
twice
since
I
have
gone
into
my
dear
boy
's
room
,
to
assure
myself
of
his
sleeping
safely
,
and
not
lying
dead
in
his
blood
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
another
entry
next
morning
:
   
"
<EOS>
"
Ned
up
and
away
.
 
<EOS>
Light
-
hearted
and
unsuspicious
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
laughed
when
I
cautioned
him
,
and
said
he
was
as
good
a
man
as
Neville
Landless
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
might
be
,
but
he
was
not
as
bad
a
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
continued
to
make
light
of
it
,
but
I
travelled
with
him
as
far
as
I
could
,
and
left
him
most
unwillingly
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
unable
to
shake
off
these
dark
intangible
presentiments
of
evil
---
if
feelings
founded
upon
staring
facts
are
to
be
so
called
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Again
and
again
,
"
said
Jasper
,
in
conclusion
,
twirling
the
leaves
of
the
book
before
putting
it
by
,
"
I
have
relapsed
into
these
moods
,
as
other
entries
show
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
have
now
your
assurance
at
my
back
,
and
shall
put
it
in
my
book
,
and
make
it
an
antidote
to
my
black
humours
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
an
antidote
,
I
hope
,
"
returned
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
as
will
induce
you
before
long
to
consign
the
black
humours
to
the
flames
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
be
the
last
to
find
any
fault
with
you
this
evening
,
when
you
have
met
my
wishes
so
freely
;
but
I
must
say
,
Jasper
,
that
your
devotion
to
your
nephew
has
made
you
exaggerative
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
my
witness
,
"
said
Jasper
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
"
what
my
state
of
mind
honestly
was
,
that
night
,
before
I
sat
down
to
write
,
and
in
what
words
I
expressed
it
.
 
<EOS>
You
remember
objecting
to
a
word
I
used
,
as
being
too
strong
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
stronger
word
than
any
in
my
Diary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
.
 
<EOS>
Try
the
antidote
,
"
rejoined
Mr
Crisparkle
;
"
and
may
it
give
you
a
brighter
and
better
view
of
the
case
!
 
<EOS>
We
will
discuss
it
no
more
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
to
thank
you
for
myself
,
thank
you
sincerely
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
shall
find
,
"
said
Jasper
,
as
they
shook
hands
,
"
that
I
will
not
do
the
thing
you
wish
me
to
do
,
by
halves
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
that
Ned
,
giving
way
at
all
,
shall
give
way
thoroughly
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
after
this
conversation
,
he
called
on
Mr
Crisparkle
with
the
following
letter
:
   
"
MY
DEAR
JACK
,
   
"
<EOS>
I
am
touched
by
your
account
of
your
interview
with
Mr
Crisparkle
,
whom
I
much
respect
and
esteem
.
 
<EOS>
At
once
I
openly
say
that
I
forgot
myself
on
that
occasion
quite
as
much
as
Mr
Landless
did
,
and
that
I
wish
that
bygone
to
be
a
bygone
,
and
all
to
be
right
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Look
here
,
<EOS>
dear
old
boy
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Mr
Landless
to
dinner
on
Christmas
Eve
(
the
better
the
day
the
better
the
deed
)
,
and
<EOS>
let
there
be
only
we
three
,
and
let
us
shake
hands
all
round
there
and
then
,
and
say
no
more
about
it
.

<EOS>
"
You
expect
Mr
Neville
,
then
?

Mr

<EOS>

I
count
upon
his
coming

Mr

Chapter
11
.
<EOS>
A
picture
and
a
ring
 
Behind
the
most
ancient
part
of
Holborn
,
London
,
where
certain
gabled
houses
some
centuries
of
age
still
stand
looking
on
the
public
way
,
as
if
disconsolately
looking
for
the
Old
Bourne
that
has
long
run
dry
,
is
a
little
nook
composed
of
two
irregular
quadrangles
,
called
Staple
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
those
nooks
,
the
turning
into
which
out
of
the
clashing
street
,
imparts
to
the
relieved
pedestrian
<EOS>
the
sensation
of
having
put
cotton
in
his
ears
,
and
velvet
soles
on
his
boots
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
one
of
those
nooks
where
a
few
smoky
sparrows
twitter
in
smoky
trees
,
as
though
they
called
to
one
another
,
"
Let
us
play
at
country
,
"
and
where
a
few
feet
of
garden
-
mould
and
a
few
yards
of
gravel
enable
them
to
do
that
refreshing
violence
to
their
tiny
understandings
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
it
is
one
of
those
nooks
which
are
legal
nooks
;
and
it
contains
a
little
Hall
,
with
a
little
lantern
in
its
roof
:
 
to
what
obstructive
purposes
devoted
,
and
at
whose
expense
,
this
history
knoweth
not
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
days
when
Cloisterham
took
offence
at
the
existence
of
a
railroad
afar
off
,
as
menacing
that
sensitive
constitution
,
the
property
of
us
Britons
:
 
the
odd
fortune
of
which
sacred
institution
<EOS>
it
is
to
be
in
exactly
equal
degrees
croaked
about
,
trembled
for
,
and
boasted
of
,
whatever
happens
to
anything
,
anywhere
in
the
world
:
 
in
those
days
no
neighbouring
architecture
of
lofty
proportions
had
arisen
to
overshadow
Staple
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
The
westering
sun
bestowed
bright
glances
on
it
,
and
the
south
-
west
wind
blew
into
it
unimpeded
.
   
<EOS>
Neither
wind
nor
sun
,
however
,
favoured
Staple
Inn
one
December
afternoon
towards
six
o'clock
,
when
it
was
filled
with
fog
,
and
candles
shed
murky
and
blurred
rays
through
the
windows
of
all
its
then
-
occupied
sets
of
chambers
;
notably
from
a
set
of
chambers
in
a
corner
house
in
the
little
inner
quadrangle
,
presenting
in
black
and
white
over
its
ugly
portal
the
mysterious
inscription
:
    
P*J*T
 
1747
   
<EOS>
In
which
set
of
chambers
,
never
having
troubled
his
head
about
the
inscription
,
unless
to
bethink
himself
at
odd
times
on
glancing
up
at
it
,
that
haply
<EOS>
it
might
mean
Perhaps
John
Thomas
,
or
Perhaps
Joe
Tyler
,
sat
Mr
Grewgious
writing
by
his
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Who
could
have
told
,
by
looking
at
Mr
Grewgious
,
whether
he
had
ever
known
ambition
or
disappointment
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
bred
to
the
Bar
,
and
had
laid
himself
out
for
chamber
practice
;
to
draw
deeds
;
"
convey
the
wise
it
call
,
"
as
Pistol
says
.
 
<EOS>
But
Conveyancing
and
he
had
made
such
a
very
indifferent
marriage
of
it
that
they
had
separated
by
consent
---
if
there
can
be
said
to
be
separation
where
there
has
never
been
coming
together
.
   
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
Coy
Conveyancing
would
not
come
to
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
wooed
,
not
won
,
and
they
went
their
several
ways
.
 
<EOS>
But
an
Arbitration
being
blown
towards
him
by
some
unaccountable
wind
,
and
he
gaining
great
credit
in
it
as
one
indefatigable
in
seeking
out
right
and
doing
right
,
a
pretty
fat
Receivership
was
next
blown
into
his
pocket
by
a
wind
more
traceable
to
its
source
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
by
chance
,
he
had
found
his
niche
.
 
<EOS>
Receiver
and
Agent
now
,
to
two
rich
estates
,
and
deputing
their
legal
business
,
in
an
amount
worth
having
,
to
a
firm
of
solicitors
on
the
floor
below
,
he
had
snuffed
out
his
ambition
(
supposing
him
to
have
ever
lighted
it
)
,
and
had
settled
down
with
his
snuffers
for
the
rest
of
his
life
under
the
dry
vine
and
fig
-
tree
of
P*J*T
,
who
planted
in
seventeen
-
forty
-
seven
.
   
<EOS>
Many
accounts
and
account
-
books
,
many
files
of
correspondence
,
and
several
strong
boxes
,
garnished
Mr
Grewgious
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
They
can
scarcely
be
represented
as
having
lumbered
it
,
so
conscientious
and
precise
was
their
orderly
arrangement
.
 
<EOS>
The
apprehension
of
dying
suddenly
,
and
leaving
one
fact
or
one
figure
with
any
incompleteness
or
obscurity
attaching
to
it
,
would
have
stretched
Mr
Grewgious
stone
-
dead
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
largest
fidelity
to
a
trust
was
the
life
-
blood
of
the
man
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
sorts
of
life
-
blood
that
course
more
quickly
,
more
gaily
,
more
attractively
;
but
there
is
no
better
sort
in
circulation
.
   
<EOS>
There
was
no
luxury
in
his
room
.
 
<EOS>
Even
its
comforts
were
limited
to
its
being
dry
and
warm
,
and
having
a
snug
though
faded
fireside
.
<EOS>
What
may
be
called
its
private
life
was
confined
to
the
hearth
,
and
all
easy
-
chair
,
and
an
old
-
fashioned
occasional
round
table
that
was
brought
out
upon
the
rug
after
business
hours
,
from
a
corner
where
it
elsewise
remained
turned
up
like
a
shining
mahogany
shield
.
 
<EOS>
Behind
it
,
when
standing
thus
on
the
defensive
,
was
a
closet
,
usually
containing
something
good
to
drink
.
 
<EOS>
An
outer
room
was
the
clerk
's
room
;
Mr
Grewgious
's
sleeping
-
room
was
across
the
common
stair
;
and
he
held
some
not
empty
cellarage
at
the
bottom
of
the
common
stair
.
 
<EOS>
Three
hundred
days
in
the
year
,
at
least
,
he
crossed
over
to
the
hotel
in
Furnival
's
Inn
for
his
dinner
,
and
after
dinner
crossed
back
again
,
to
make
the
most
of
these
simplicities
until
it
should
become
broad
business
day
once
more
,
with
P*J*T
,
date
seventeen
-
forty
-
seven
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Grewgious
sat
and
wrote
by
his
fire
that
afternoon
,
so
did
the
clerk
of
Mr
Grewgious
sit
and
write
by
HIS
fire
.
 
<EOS>
A
pale
,
puffy
-
faced
,
dark
-
haired
person
of
thirty
,
with
big
dark
eyes
that
wholly
wanted
lustre
,
and
a
dissatisfied
doughy
complexion
,
that
seemed
to
ask
to
be
sent
to
the
baker
's
,
this
attendant
was
a
mysterious
being
,
possessed
of
some
strange
power
over
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
As
though
he
had
been
called
into
existence
,
like
a
fabulous
Familiar
,
by
a
magic
spell
which
had
failed
when
required
to
dismiss
him
,
he
stuck
tight
to
Mr
Grewgious
's
stool
,
although
Mr
Grewgious
's
comfort
and
convenience
would
manifestly
have
been
advanced
by
dispossessing
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
gloomy
person
with
tangled
locks
,
and
a
general
air
of
having
been
reared
under
the
shadow
of
that
baleful
tree
of
Java
which
has
given
shelter
to
more
lies
than
the
whole
botanical
kingdom
,
Mr
Grewgious
,
nevertheless
,
treated
him
with
unaccountable
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Bazzard
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
on
the
entrance
of
his
clerk
:
looking
up
from
his
papers
as
he
arranged
them
for
the
night
:
"
what
is
in
the
wind
besides
fog
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Drood
,
"
said
Bazzard
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
of
him
?
"
   
"
Has
called
,
"
said
Bazzard
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
might
have
shown
him
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
doing
it
,
"
said
Bazzard
.
   
<EOS>
The
visitor
came
in
accordingly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
me
!
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
looking
round
his
pair
of
office
candles
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
had
called
and
merely
left
your
name
and
gone
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
you
do
,
Mr
Edwin
?
 
<EOS>
Dear
me
,
you
're
choking
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
this
fog
,
"
returned
Edwin
;
"
and
it
makes
my
eyes
smart
,
like
Cayenne
pepper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
really
so
bad
as
that
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
undo
your
wrappers
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
fortunate
<EOS>
I
have
so
good
a
fire
;
but
Mr
Bazzard
has
taken
care
of
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
I
have
n't
,
"
said
Mr
Bazzard
at
the
door
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
then
it
follows
that
I
must
have
taken
care
of
myself
without
observing
it
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
seated
in
my
chair
.
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
!
 
<EOS>
Coming
out
of
such
an
atmosphere
,
in
MY
chair
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
took
the
easy
-
chair
in
the
corner
;
and
the
fog
he
had
brought
in
with
him
,
and
the
fog
he
took
off
with
his
greatcoat
and
neck
-
shawl
,
was
speedily
licked
up
by
the
eager
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
look
,
"
said
Edwin
,
smiling
,
"
as
if
I
had
come
to
stop
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
---
By
the
by
,
"
cried
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
excuse
my
interrupting
you
;
do
stop
.
 
<EOS>
The
fog
may
clear
in
an
hour
or
two
.
 
<EOS>
We
can
have
dinner
in
from
just
across
Holborn
.
 
<EOS>
You
had
better
take
your
Cayenne
pepper
here
than
outside
;
pray
stop
and
dine
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Edwin
,
glancing
about
him
as
though
attracted
by
the
notion
of
a
new
and
relishing
sort
of
gipsy
-
party
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
YOU
are
very
kind
to
join
issue
with
a
bachelor
in
chambers
,
and
take
pot
-
luck
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
'll
ask
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
dropping
his
voice
,
and
speaking
with
a
twinkling
eye
,
as
if
inspired
with
a
bright
thought
:
 
"
I
'll
ask
Bazzard
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
n't
like
it
else
.
<EOS>
---
Bazzard
!
"
   
<EOS>
Bazzard
reappeared
.
   
<EOS>
"
Dine
presently
with
Mr
Drood
and
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
ordered
to
dine
,
of
course
I
will
,
sir
,
"
was
the
gloomy
answer
.
   
<EOS>
"
Save
the
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
ordered
;
you
're
invited
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Bazzard
;
"
in
that
case
I
do
n't
care
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
And
perhaps
you
would
n't
mind
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
stepping
over
to
the
hotel
in
Furnival
's
,
and
asking
them
to
send
in
materials
for
laying
the
cloth
.
 
<EOS>
For
dinner
we
'll
have
a
tureen
of
the
hottest
and
strongest
soup
available
,
and
we
'll
have
the
best
made
-
dish
that
can
be
recommended
,
and
we
'll
have
a
joint
(
such
as
a
haunch
of
mutton
)
,
and
we
'll
have
a
goose
,
or
a
turkey
,
or
any
little
stuffed
thing
of
that
sort
that
may
happen
to
be
in
the
bill
of
fare
---
in
short
,
we
'll
have
whatever
there
is
on
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
liberal
directions
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
issued
with
his
usual
air
of
reading
an
inventory
,
or
repeating
a
lesson
,
or
doing
anything
else
by
rote
.
 
<EOS>
Bazzard
,
after
drawing
out
the
round
table
,
withdrew
to
execute
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
little
delicate
,
you
see
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
after
his
clerk
's
departure
,
"
about
employing
him
in
the
foraging
or
commissariat
department
.
 
<EOS>
Because
he
might
n't
like
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
seems
to
have
his
own
way
,
sir
,
"
remarked
Edwin
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
own
way
?
"
returned
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
dear
no
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
,
you
quite
mistake
him
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
his
own
way
,
he
would
n't
be
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
where
he
would
be
!
"
<EOS>
Edwin
thought
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
only
thought
it
,
because
Mr
Grewgious
came
and
stood
himself
with
his
back
to
the
other
corner
of
the
fire
,
and
his
shoulder
-
blades
against
the
chimneypiece
,
and
collected
his
skirts
for
easy
conversation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
take
it
,
without
having
the
gift
of
prophecy
,
that
you
have
done
me
the
favour
of
looking
in
to
mention
that
you
are
going
down
yonder
---
where
I
can
tell
you
,
you
are
expected
---
and
to
offer
to
execute
any
little
commission
from
me
to
my
charming
ward
,
and
perhaps
to
sharpen
me
up
a
bit
in
any
proceedings
?
 
<EOS>
Eh
,
Mr
Edwin
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
called
,
sir
,
before
going
down
,
as
an
act
of
attention
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Of
attention
!
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
of
course
,
not
of
impatience
?
"
   
"
Impatience
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
had
meant
to
be
arch
---
not
that
he
in
the
remotest
degree
expressed
that
meaning
---
and
had
brought
himself
into
scarcely
supportable
proximity
with
the
fire
,
as
if
to
burn
the
fullest
effect
of
his
archness
into
himself
,
as
other
subtle
impressions
are
burnt
into
hard
metals
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
archness
suddenly
flying
before
the
composed
face
and
manner
of
his
visitor
,
and
only
the
fire
remaining
,
he
started
and
rubbed
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
lately
been
down
yonder
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
rearranging
his
skirts
;
"
and
that
was
what
I
referred
to
,
when
I
said
I
could
tell
you
you
are
expected
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
;
I
knew
that
Pussy
was
looking
out
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
keep
a
cat
down
there
?
"
asked
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
Edwin
coloured
a
little
as
he
explained
:
 
"
I
call
Rosa
Pussy
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
really
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
smoothing
down
his
head
;
"
that
's
very
affable
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
glanced
at
his
face
,
uncertain
whether
or
no
he
seriously
objected
to
the
appellation
.
 
<EOS>
But
Edwin
might
as
well
have
glanced
at
the
face
of
a
clock
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
pet
name
,
sir
,
"
he
explained
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Umps
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
a
nod
.
 
<EOS>
But
with
such
an
extraordinary
compromise
between
an
unqualified
assent
and
a
qualified
dissent
,
that
his
visitor
was
much
disconcerted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
PRosa
---
"
Edwin
began
by
way
of
recovering
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
PRosa
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
say
Pussy
,
and
changed
my
mind
;
---
did
she
tell
you
anything
about
the
Landlesses
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No

said
Mr
Grewgious

<EOS>
"
What
is
the
Landlesses

An

A

<EOS>

A

PRosa

Mr
Grewgious
struck
in

with
a
fixed
face

<EOS>
"
She
is
a
strikingly
handsome
girl

Neither

Mr

Bazzard
returned
,
accompanied
by
two
waiters
---
an
immovable
waiter
,
and
a
flying
waiter
;
and
the
three
brought
in
with
them
as
much
fog
as
gave
a
new
roar
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
The
flying
waiter
,
who
had
brought
everything
on
his
shoulders
,
laid
the
cloth
with
amazing
rapidity
and
dexterity
;
while
the
immovable
waiter
,
who
had
brought
nothing
,
found
fault
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
flying
waiter
then
highly
polished
all
the
glasses
he
had
brought
,
and
the
immovable
waiter
looked
through
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
flying
waiter
then
flew
across
Holborn
for
the
soup
,
and
flew
back
again
,
and
then
took
another
flight
for
the
made
-
dish
,
and
flew
back
again
,
and
then
took
another
flight
for
the
joint
and
poultry
,
and
flew
back
again
,
and
between
whiles
took
supplementary
flights
for
a
great
variety
of
articles
,
as
it
was
discovered
from
time
to
time
that
the
immovable
waiter
had
forgotten
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
But
let
<EOS>
the
flying
waiter
cleave
the
air
as
he
might
,
he
was
always
reproached
on
his
return
by
the
immovable
waiter
for
bringing
fog
with
him
,
and
being
out
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
the
repast
,
by
which
time
the
flying
waiter
was
severely
blown
,
the
immovable
waiter
gathered
up
the
tablecloth
under
his
arm
with
a
grand
air
,
and
having
sternly
(
not
to
say
with
indignation
)
looked
on
at
the
flying
waiter
while
he
set
the
clean
glasses
round
,
directed
a
valedictory
glance
towards
Mr
Grewgious
,
conveying
:
"
<EOS>
Let
it
be
clearly
understood
between
us
that
the
reward
is
mine
,
and
that
Nil
is
the
claim
of
this
slave
,
"
and
pushed
the
flying
waiter
before
him
out
of
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
highly
-
finished
miniature
painting
representing
My
Lords
of
the
Circumlocution
Department
,
Commandership
-
in
-
Chief
of
any
sort
,
Government
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
an
edifying
little
picture
to
be
hung
on
the
line
in
the
National
Gallery
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
fog
had
been
the
proximate
cause
of
this
sumptuous
repast
,
so
the
fog
served
for
its
general
sauce
.
 
<EOS>
To
hear
the
out
-
door
clerks
sneezing
,
wheezing
,
and
beating
their
feet
on
the
gravel
was
a
zest
far
surpassing
Doctor
Kitchener
's
.
 
<EOS>
To
bid
,
with
a
shiver
,
the
unfortunate
flying
waiter
shut
the
door
before
he
had
opened
it
,
was
a
condiment
of
a
profounder
flavour
than
Harvey
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
let
it
be
noticed
,
parenthetically
,
that
the
leg
of
this
young
man
,
in
its
application
to
the
door
,
evinced
the
finest
sense
of
touch
:
always
preceding
himself
and
tray
(
with
something
of
an
angling
air
about
it
)
,
by
some
seconds
:
 
and
always
lingering
after
he
and
the
tray
had
disappeared
,
like
Macbeth
's
leg
when
accompanying
him
off
the
stage
with
reluctance
to
the
assassination
of
Duncan
.
   
<EOS>
The
host
had
gone
below
to
the
cellar
,
and
had
brought
up
bottles
of
ruby
,
straw
-
coloured
,
and
golden
drinks
,
which
had
ripened
long
ago
in
lands
where
no
fogs
are
,
and
had
since
lain
slumbering
in
the
shade
.
 
<EOS>
Sparkling
and
tingling
after
so
long
a
nap
,
they
pushed
at
their
corks
to
help
the
corkscrew
(
like
prisoners
helping
rioters
to
force
their
gates
)
,
and
danced
out
gaily
.
 
<EOS>
If
P*J*T
in
seventeen
-
forty
-
seven
,
or
in
any
other
year
of
his
period
,
drank
such
wines
---
then
,
for
a
certainty
,
P*J*T
was
Pretty
Jolly
<EOS>
Too
.
   
<EOS>
Externally
,
Mr
Grewgious
showed
no
signs
of
being
mellowed
by
these
glowing
vintages
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
his
drinking
them
,
they
might
have
been
poured
over
him
in
his
high
-
dried
snuff
form
,
and
run
to
waste
,
for
any
lights
and
shades
they
caused
to
flicker
over
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
was
his
manner
influenced
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
his
wooden
way
,
he
had
observant
eyes
for
Edwin
;
and
when
at
the
end
of
dinner
,
he
motioned
Edwin
back
to
his
own
easy
-
chair
in
the
fireside
corner
,
and
Edwin
sank
luxuriously
into
it
after
very
brief
remonstrance
,
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
he
turned
his
seat
round
towards
the
fire
too
,
and
smoothed
his
head
and
face
,
might
have
been
seen
looking
at
his
visitor
between
his
smoothing
fingers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bazzard
!
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
suddenly
turning
to
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
follow
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bazzard
;
who
had
done
his
work
of
consuming
meat
and
drink
in
a
workmanlike
manner
,
though
mostly
in
speechlessness
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
drink
to
you
,
Bazzard
;
Mr
Edwin
,
success
to
Mr
Bazzard
!
"
   
"
Success
to
Mr
Bazzard
!
"
echoed
Edwin
,
with
a
totally
unfounded
appearance
of
enthusiasm
,
and
with
the
unspoken
addition
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
in
,
I
wonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
May
!
"
pursued
Mr
Grewgious
---
"
I
am
not
at
liberty
to
be
definite
---
May
!
<EOS>
---
my
conversational
powers
are
so
very
limited
that
I
know
I
shall
not
come
well
out
of
this
---
<EOS>
May
!
<EOS>
---
it
ought
to
be
put
imaginatively
,
but
I
have
no
imagination
---
<EOS>
May
!
---
the
thorn
of
anxiety
is
as
nearly
the
mark
as
I
am
likely
to
get
---
May
it
come
out
at
last
!
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Bazzard
,
with
a
frowning
smile
at
the
fire
,
put
a
hand
into
his
tangled
locks
,
as
if
the
thorn
of
anxiety
were
there
;
then
into
his
waistcoat
,
as
if
it
were
there
;
then
into
his
pockets
,
as
if
it
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
these
movements
he
was
closely
followed
by
the
eyes
of
Edwin
,
as
if
that
young
gentleman
expected
to
see
the
thorn
in
action
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
produced
,
however
,
and
Mr
Bazzard
merely
said
:
 
"
I
follow
you
,
sir
,
and
I
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
jingling
his
glass
on
the
table
with
one
hand
,
and
bending
aside
under
cover
of
the
other
,
to
whisper
to
Edwin
,
"
to
drink
to
my
ward
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
put
Bazzard
first
.
<EOS>
He
might
n't
like
it
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
was
said
with
a
mysterious
wink
;
or
what
would
have
been
a
wink
,
if
,
in
Mr
Grewgious
's
hands
,
it
could
have
been
quick
enough
.
 
<EOS>
So
Edwin
winked
responsively
,
without
the
least
idea
what
he
meant
by
doing
so
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
I
devote
a
bumper
to
the
fair
and
fascinating
Miss
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
Bazzard
,
the
fair
and
fascinating
Miss
Rosa
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
follow
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Bazzard
,
"
and
I
pledge
you
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
do
I
!
"
said
Edwin
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
,
"
cried
Mr
Grewgious
,
breaking
the
blank
silence
which
of
course
ensued
:
 
though
why
these
pauses
SHOULD
come
upon
us
when
we
have
performed
any
small
social
rite
,
not
directly
inducive
of
self
-
examination
or
mental
despondency
,
who
can
tell
?
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
particularly
Angular
man
,
and
yet
I
fancy
(
if
I
may
use
the
word
,
not
having
a
morsel
of
fancy
)
,
that
I
could
draw
a
picture
of
a
true
lover
's
state
of
mind
,
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
us
follow
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Bazzard
,
"
and
have
the
picture
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Edwin
will
correct
it
where
it
's
wrong
,
"
resumed
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
and
will
throw
in
a
few
touches
from
the
life
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
say
it
is
wrong
in
many
particulars
,
and
wants
many
touches
from
the
life
,
for
I
was
born
a
Chip
,
and
have
neither
soft
sympathies
nor
soft
experiences
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
I
hazard
the
guess
that
the
true
lover
's
mind
is
completely
permeated
by
the
beloved
object
of
his
affections
.
 
<EOS>
I
hazard
the
guess
that
her
dear
name
is
precious
to
him
,
can
not
be
heard
or
repeated
without
emotion
,
and
is
preserved
sacred
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
has
any
distinguishing
appellation
of
fondness
for
her
,
it
is
reserved
for
her
,
and
is
not
for
common
ears
.
 
<EOS>
A
name
that
it
would
be
a
privilege
to
call
her
by
,
being
alone
with
her
own
bright
self
<EOS>
,
it
would
be
a
liberty
,
a
coldness
,
an
insensibility
,
almost
a
breach
of
good
faith
,
to
flaunt
elsewhere
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
to
see
Mr
Grewgious
sitting
bolt
upright
,
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
continuously
chopping
this
discourse
out
of
himself
:
 
much
as
a
charity
boy
with
a
very
good
memory
might
get
his
catechism
said
:
 
and
evincing
no
correspondent
emotion
<EOS>
whatever
,
unless
in
a
certain
occasional
little
tingling
perceptible
at
the
end
of
his
nose
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
picture
,
"
Mr
Grewgious
proceeded
,
"
goes
on
to
represent
(
under
correction
from
you
,
Mr
Edwin
)
,
the
true
lover
as
ever
impatient
to
be
in
the
presence
or
vicinity
of
the
beloved
object
of
his
affections
;
as
caring
very
little
for
his
case
in
any
other
society
;
and
as
constantly
seeking
that
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
to
say
seeking
that
,
as
a
bird
seeks
its
nest
,
I
should
make
an
ass
of
myself
,
because
that
would
trench
upon
what
I
understand
to
be
poetry
;
and
I
am
so
far
from
trenching
upon
poetry
at
any
time
,
that
I
never
,
to
my
knowledge
,
got
within
ten
thousand
miles
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
am
besides
totally
unacquainted
with
the
habits
of
birds
,
except
the
birds
of
Staple
Inn
,
who
seek
their
nests
on
ledges
,
and
in
gutter
-
pipes
and
chimneypots
,
not
constructed
for
them
by
the
beneficent
hand
of
Nature
.
 
<EOS>
I
beg
,
therefore
,
to
be
understood
as
foregoing
the
bird's
-
nest
.
 
<EOS>
But
my
picture
does
represent
the
true
lover
as
having
no
existence
separable
from
that
of
the
beloved
object
of
his
affections
,
and
as
living
at
once
a
doubled
life
and
a
halved
life
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
do
not
clearly
express
what
I
mean
by
that
,
it
is
either
for
the
reason
that
having
no
conversational
powers
,
I
can
not
express
what
I
mean
,
or
that
having
no
meaning
,
I
do
not
mean
what
I
fail
to
express
.
 
<EOS>
Which
,
to
the
best
of
my
belief
,
is
not
the
case
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
had
turned
red
and
turned
white
,
as
certain
points
of
this
picture
came
into
the
light
.
 
<EOS>
He
now
sat
looking
at
the
fire
,
and
bit
his
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
speculations
of
an
Angular
man
,
"
resumed
Mr
Grewgious
,
still
sitting
and
speaking
exactly
as
before
,
"
are
probably
erroneous
on
so
globular
a
topic
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
figure
to
myself
(
<EOS>
subject
,
as
before
,
to
Mr
Edwin
's
correction
)
,
that
there
can
be
no
coolness
,
no
lassitude
,
no
doubt
,
no
indifference
,
no
half
fire
and
half
smoke
state
of
mind
,
in
a
real
lover
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
am
I
at
all
near
the
mark
in
my
picture
?
"
   
<EOS>
As
abrupt
in
his
conclusion
as
in
his
commencement
and
progress
,
he
jerked
this
inquiry
at
Edwin
,
and
stopped
when
one
might
have
supposed
him
in
the
middle
of
his
oration
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
sir
,
"
stammered
Edwin
,
"
as
you
refer
the
question
to
me
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
I
refer
it
to
you
,
as
an
authority
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
say
,
then
,
sir
,
"
Edwin
went
on
,
embarrassed
,
"
that
the
picture
you
have
drawn
is
generally
correct
;
but
I
submit
that
perhaps
you
may
be
rather
hard
upon
the
unlucky
lover
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Likely
so
,
"
assented
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
likely
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
hard
man
in
the
grain
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
may
not
show
,
"
said
Edwin
,
"
all
he
feels
;
or
he
may
not
---
"
   
<EOS>
There
he
stopped
so
long
,
to
find
the
rest
of
his
sentence
,
that
Mr
Grewgious
rendered
his
difficulty
a
thousand
times
the
greater
by
unexpectedly
striking
in
with
:
   
<EOS>
"
No
to
be
sure
;
he
MAY
not
!
"
   
<EOS>
After
that
,
they
all
sat
silent
;
the
silence
of
Mr
Bazzard
being
occasioned
by
slumber
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
responsibility
is
very
great
,
though
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
at
length
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Edwin
nodded
assent
,
with
HIS
eyes
on
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
let
him
be
sure
that
he
trifles
with
no
one
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
neither
with
himself
,
nor
with
any
other
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
bit
his
lip
again
,
and
still
sat
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
not
make
a
plaything
of
a
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
Woe
betide
him
if
he
does
!
 
<EOS>
Let
him
take
that
well
to
heart
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
Though
he
said
these
things
in
short
sentences
,
much
as
the
supposititious
charity
boy
just
now
referred
to
might
have
repeated
a
verse
or
two
from
the
Book
of
Proverbs
,
there
was
something
dreamy
(
for
so
literal
a
man
)
in
the
way
in
which
he
now
shook
his
right
forefinger
at
the
live
coals
in
the
grate
,
and
again
fell
silent
.
   
<EOS>
But
not
for
long
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
sat
upright
and
stiff
in
his
chair
,
he
suddenly
rapped
his
knees
,
like
the
carved
image
of
some
queer
Joss
or
other
coming
out
of
its
reverie
,
and
said
:
 
"
We
must
finish
this
bottle

Mr
Edwin
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
help
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
help
Bazzard
too
,
though
he
IS
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
He
might
n't
like
it
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
helped
them
both
,
and
helped
himself
,
and
drained
his
glass
,
and
stood
it
bottom
upward
on
the
table
,
as
though
he
had
just
caught
a
bluebottle
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr
Edwin
,
"
he
proceeded
,
wiping
his
mouth
and
hands
upon
his
handkerchief
:
 
"
to
a
little
piece
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
You
received
from
me
,
the
other
day
,
a
certified
copy
of
Miss
Rosa
's
father
's
will
.
 
<EOS>
You
knew
its
contents
before
,
but
you
received
it
from
me
as
a
matter
of
business
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
sent
it
to
Mr
Jasper
,
but
for
Miss
Rosa
's
wishing
it
to
come
straight
to
you
,
in
preference
.
 
<EOS>
You
received
it
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Quite
safely
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
should
have
acknowledged
its
receipt
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
business
being
business
<EOS>
all
the
world
over
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
you
did
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
meant
to
have
acknowledged
it
when
I
first
came
in
this
evening
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
business
-
like
acknowledgment
,
"
returned
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
however
,
let
that
pass
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
in
that
document
you
have
observed
a
few
words
of
kindly
allusion
to
its
being
left
to
me
to
discharge
a
little
trust
,
confided
to
me
in
conversation
,
at
such
time
as
I
in
my
discretion
may
think
best
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Edwin
,
it
came
into
my
mind
just
now
,
when
I
was
looking
at
the
fire
,
that
I
could
,
in
my
discretion
,
acquit
myself
of
that
trust
at
no
better
time
than
the
present
.
 
<EOS>
Favour
me
with
your
attention
,
half
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
,
singled
out
by
the
candle
-
light
the
key
he
wanted
,
and
then
,
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
,
went
to
a
bureau
or
escritoire
,
unlocked
it
,
touched
the
spring
of
a
little
secret
drawer
,
and
took
from
it
an
ordinary
ring
-
case
made
for
a
single
ring
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
in
his
hand
,
he
returned
to
his
chair
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
held
it
up
for
the
young
man
to
see
,
his
hand
trembled
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Edwin
,
this
rose
of
diamonds
and
rubies
delicately
set
in
gold
,
was
a
ring
belonging
to
Miss
Rosa
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
removed
from
her
dead
hand
,
in
my
presence
,
with
such
distracted
grief
as
I
hope
it
may
never
be
my
lot
to
contemplate
again
.
 
<EOS>
Hard
man
as
I
am
,
I
am
not
hard
enough
for
that
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
bright
these
stones
shine
!
"
<EOS>
opening
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
the
eyes
that
were
so
much
brighter
,
and
that
so
often
looked
upon
them
with
a
light
and
a
proud
heart
,
have
been
ashes
among
ashes
,
and
dust
among
dust
,
some
years
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
any
imagination
(
which
it
is
needless
to
say
I
have
not
)
,
I
might
imagine
that
the
lasting
beauty
of
these
stones
was
almost
cruel
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
closed
the
case
again
as
he
spoke
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
ring
was
given
to
the
young
lady
who
was
drowned
so
early
in
her
beautiful
and
happy
career
,
by
her
husband
,
when
they
first
plighted
their
faith
to
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
he
who
removed
it
from
her
unconscious
hand
,
and
it
was
he
who
,
when
his
death
drew
very
near
,
placed
it
in
mine
.
 
<EOS>
The
trust
in
which
I
received
it
,
was
,
that
,
you
and
Miss
Rosa
growing
to
manhood
and
womanhood
,
and
your
betrothal
prospering
and
coming
to
maturity
,
I
should
give
it
to
you
to
place
upon
her
finger
.
 
<EOS>
Failing
those
desired
results
,
it
was
to
remain
in
my
possession
.
"
   
<EOS>
Some
trouble
was
in
the
young
man
's
face
,
and
some
indecision
was
in
the
action
of
his
hand
,
as
Mr
Grewgious
,
looking
steadfastly
at
him
,
gave
him
the
ring
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
placing
it
on
her
finger
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
will
be
the
solemn
seal
upon
your
strict
fidelity
to
the
living
and
the
dead
.
<EOS>
You
are
going
to
her
,
to
make
the
last
irrevocable
preparations
for
your
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
Take
it
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
young
man
took
the
little
case
,
and
placed
it
in
his
breast
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
anything
should
be
amiss
,
if
anything
should
be
even
slightly
wrong
,
between
you
;
if
you
should
have
any
secret
consciousness
that
you
are
committing
yourself
to
this
step
for
no
higher
reason
than
because
you
have
long
been
accustomed
to
look
forward
to
it
;
then
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
I
charge
you
once
more
,
by
the
living
and
by
the
dead
,
to
bring
that
ring
back
to
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
Here
Bazzard
awoke
himself
by
his
own
snoring
;
and
,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
,
sat
apoplectically
staring
at
vacancy
,
as
defying
vacancy
to
accuse
him
of
having
been
asleep
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bazzard
!
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
harder
than
ever
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
follow
you
,
sir
,
"
said
Bazzard
,
"
and
I
have
been
following
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
discharge
of
a
trust
,
I
have
handed
Mr
Edwin
Drood
a
ring
of
diamonds
and
rubies
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
?
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
reproduced
the
little
case
,
and
opened
it
;
and
Bazzard
looked
into
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
follow
you
both
,
sir
,
"
returned
Bazzard
,
"
and
I
witness
the
transaction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Evidently
anxious
to
get
away
and
be
alone
,
Edwin
Drood
now
resumed
his
outer
clothing
,
muttering
something
about
time
and
appointments
.
 
<EOS>
The
fog
was
reported
no
clearer
(
by
the
flying
waiter
,
who
alighted
from
a
speculative
flight
in
the
coffee
interest
)
,
but
he
went
out
into
it
;
and
Bazzard
,
after
his
manner
,
"
followed
"
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
left
alone
,
walked
softly
and
slowly
to
and
fro
,
for
an
hour
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
restless
to
-
night
,
and
seemed
dispirited
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
I
have
done
right
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
appeal
to
him
seemed
necessary
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
hard
to
lose
the
ring
,
and
yet
it
must
have
gone
from
me
very
soon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
closed
the
empty
little
drawer
with
a
sigh
,
and
shut
and
locked
the
escritoire
,
and
came
back
to
the
solitary
fireside
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
ring
,
"
he
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
it
come
back
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
My
mind
hangs
about
her
ring
very
uneasily
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
is
explainable
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
had
it
so
long
,
and
I
have
prized
it
so
much
!
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
---
"
   
<EOS>
He
was
in
a
wondering
mood
as
well
as
a
restless
;
for
,
though
he
checked
himself
at
that
point
,
and
took
another
walk
,
he
resumed
his
wondering
when
he
sat
down
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
(
for
the
ten
-
thousandth
time
,
and
what
a
weak
fool
<EOS>
I
,
for
what
can
it
signify
now
!
)
<EOS>
whether
he
confided
the
charge
of
their
orphan
child
to
me
,
because
he
knew
---
<EOS>
Good
God
,
how
like
her
mother
she
has
become
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
ever
so
much
as
suspected
that
some
one
doted
on
her
,
at
a
hopeless
,
speechless
distance
,
when
he
struck
in
and
won
her
.
 
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
it
ever
crept
into
his
mind
who
that
unfortunate
some
one
was
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
I
shall
sleep
to
-
night
!
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
will
shut
out
the
world
with
the
bedclothes
,
and
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
crossed
the
staircase
to
his
raw
and
foggy
bedroom
,
and
was
soon
ready
for
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Dimly
catching
sight
of
his
face
in
the
misty
looking
-
glass
<EOS>
,
he
held
his
candle
to
it
for
a
moment
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
likely
some
one
,
YOU
,
to
come
into
anybody
's
thoughts
in
such
an
aspect
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
there
!
 
<EOS>
Get
to
bed
,
poor
man
,
and
cease
to
jabber
!
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
extinguished
his
light
,
pulled
up
the
bedclothes
around
him
,
and
with
another
sigh
shut
out
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
there
are
such
unexplored
romantic
nooks
in
the
unlikeliest
men
,
that
even
old
tinderous
and
touchwoody
P*J*T

at
some
odd
times

<EOS>
A
night
with
Durdles
 
<EOS>
When
Mr
Sapsea
has
nothing
better
to
do
,
towards
evening
,
and
finds
the
contemplation
of
his
own
profundity
becoming
a
little
monotonous
in
spite
of
the
vastness
of
the
subject
,
he
often
takes
an
airing
in
the
Cathedral
Close
and
thereabout
.
 
<EOS>
He
likes
to
pass
the
churchyard
with
a
swelling
air
of
proprietorship
,
and
to
encourage
in
his
breast
a
sort
of
benignant
-
landlord
feeling
,
in
that
he
has
been
bountiful
towards
that
meritorious
tenant
,
Mrs
Sapsea
,
and
has
publicly
given
her
a
prize
.
 
<EOS>
He
likes
to
see
a
stray
face
or
two
looking
in
through
the
railings
,
and
perhaps
reading
his
inscription
.
 
<EOS>
Should
he
meet
a
stranger
coming
from
the
churchyard
with
a
quick
step
,
he
is
morally
convinced
that
the
stranger
is
"
with
a
blush
retiring
,
"
as
monumentally
directed
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
's
importance
has
received
enhancement
,
for
he
has
become
Mayor
of
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
Without
mayors
,
and
many
of
them
,
it
can
not
be
disputed
that
the
whole
framework
of
society
---
Mr
Sapsea
is
confident
that
he
invented
that
forcible
figure
---
would
fall
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Mayors
have
been
knighted
for
"
going
up
"
with
addresses
:
explosive
machines
intrepidly
discharging
shot
and
shell
into
the
English
Grammar
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
may
"
go
up
"
with
an
address
.
 
<EOS>
Rise
,
Sir
Thomas
Sapsea
!
 
<EOS>
Of
such
is
the
salt
of
the
earth
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
has
improved
the
acquaintance
of
Mr
Jasper
,
since
their
first
meeting
to
partake
of
port
,
epitaph
,
backgammon
,
beef
,
and
salad
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
has
been
received
at
the
gatehouse
with
kindred
hospitality
;
and
on
that
occasion
Mr
Jasper
seated
himself
at
the
piano
,
and
sang
to
him
,
tickling
his
ears
---
figuratively
---
long
enough
to
present
a
considerable
area
for
tickling
.
 
<EOS>
What
Mr
Sapsea
likes
in
that
young
man
is
,
that
he
is
always
ready
to
profit
by
the
wisdom
of
his
elders
,
and
that
he
is
sound
,
sir
,
at
the
core
.
 
<EOS>
In
proof
of
which
,
he
sang
to
Mr
Sapsea
that
evening
,
no
kickshaw
ditties
,
favourites
with
national
enemies
,
but
gave
him
the
genuine
George
the
Third
home
-
brewed
;
exhorting
him
(
as
"
my
brave
boys
"
)
to
reduce
to
a
smashed
condition
all
other
islands
but
this
island
,
and
all
continents
,
peninsulas
,
isthmuses
,
promontories
,
and
other
geographical
forms
of
land
soever
,
besides
sweeping
the
seas
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
rendered
it
pretty
clear
that
Providence
made
a
distinct
mistake
in
originating
so
small
a
nation
of
hearts
of
oak
,
and
so
many
other
verminous
peoples
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
,
walking
slowly
this
moist
evening
near
the
churchyard
with
his
hands
behind
him
,
on
the
look
-
out
for
a
blushing
and
retiring
stranger
,
turns
a
corner
,
and
comes
instead
into
the
goodly
presence
of
the
Dean
,
conversing
with
the
Verger
and
Mr
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
makes
his
obeisance
,
and
is
instantly
stricken
far
more
ecclesiastical
than
any
Archbishop
of
York
or
Canterbury
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
evidently
going
to
write
a
book
about
us
,
Mr
Jasper
,
"
quoth
the
Dean
;
"
to
write
a
book
about
us
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
We
are
very
ancient
,
and
we
ought
to
make
a
good
book
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
not
so
richly
endowed
in
possessions
as
in
age
;
but
perhaps
you
will
put
THAT
in
your
book
,
among
other
things
,
and
call
attention
to
our
wrongs
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tope
,
as
in
duty
bound
,
is
greatly
entertained
by
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
really
have
no
intention
at
all
,
sir
,
"
replies
Jasper
,
"
of
turning
author
or
archaeologist
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
a
whim
of
mine
.
 
<EOS>
And
even
for
my
whim
,
Mr
Sapsea
here
is
more
accountable
than
I
am
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
so
,
Mr
Mayor
?
"
says
the
Dean
,
with
a
nod
of
good
-
natured
recognition
of
his
Fetch
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
is
that
,
Mr
Mayor
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
aware
,
"
Mr
Sapsea
remarks
,
looking
about
him
for
information
,
"
to
what
the
Very
Reverend
the
Dean
does
me
the
honour
of
referring
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
falls
to
studying
his
original
in
minute
points
of
detail
.
   
<EOS>
"
Durdles

Mr
Tope
hints

<EOS>
"
Ay

<EOS>
the
Dean
echoes
;
"
Durdles
,
Durdles
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
truth
is
,
sir
,
"
explains
Jasper
,
"
that
my
curiosity
in
the
man
was
first
really
stimulated
by
Mr
Sapsea

Mr
Sapsea
's
knowledge
of
mankind
and
power
of
drawing
out
whatever
is
recluse
or
odd
around
him
,
first
led
to
my
bestowing
a
second
thought
upon
the
man
:
 
though
of
course
I
had
met
him
constantly
about
.
 
<EOS>
You
would
not
be
surprised
by
this
,
Mr
Dean
,
if
you
had
seen
Mr
Sapsea
deal
with
him
in
his
own
parlour
,
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Sapsea
,
picking
up
the
ball
thrown
to
him
with
ineffable
complacency
and
pomposity
;
"
<EOS>
yes
,
yes
.
 
<EOS>
The
Very
Reverend
the
Dean
refers
to
that
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
I
happened
to
bring
Durdles
and
Mr
Jasper
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
regard
Durdles
as
a
Character
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
character
,
Mr
Sapsea
,
that
with
a
few
skilful
touches
you
turn
inside
out
,
"
says
Jasper
.
   
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
not
quite
that
,
"
returns
the
lumbering
auctioneer
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
a
little
influence
over
him
,
perhaps
;
and
a
little
insight
into
his
character
,
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
The
Very
Reverend
the
Dean
will
please
to
bear
in
mind
that
I
have
seen
the
world
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mr
Sapsea
gets
a
little
behind
the
Dean
,
to
inspect
his
coat
-
buttons
.
   
<EOS>
"
Well
!
"
says
the
Dean
,
looking
about
him
to
see
what
has
become
of
his
copyist
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
hope
,
Mr
Mayor
,
you
will
use
your
study
and
knowledge
of
Durdles
to
the
good
purpose
of
exhorting
him
not
to
break
our
worthy
and
respected
Choir
-
Master
's
neck
;
we
can
not
afford
it
;
his
head
and
voice
are
much
too
valuable
to
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tope
is
again
highly
entertained
,
and
,
having
fallen
into
respectful
convulsions
of
laughter
,
subsides
into
a
deferential
murmur
,
importing
that
surely
any
gentleman
would
deem
it
a
pleasure
and
an
honour
to
have
his
neck
broken
,
in
return
for
such
a
compliment
from
such
a
source
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
take
it
upon
myself
,
sir
,
"
observes
Sapsea
loftily
,
"
to
answer
for
Mr
Jasper
's
neck
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
tell
Durdles
to
be
careful
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
mind
what
I
say
.
 
<EOS>
How
is
it
at
present
endangered
?
<EOS>
"
he
inquires
,
looking
about
him
with
magnificent
patronage
.
   
<EOS>
"
Only
by
my
making
a
moonlight
expedition
with
Durdles
among
the
tombs
,
vaults
,
towers
,
and
ruins
,
"
returns
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
remember
suggesting
,
when
you
brought
us
together
,
that
,
as
a
lover
of
the
picturesque
,
it
might
be
worth
my
while
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
remember
!
"
replies
the
auctioneer
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
solemn
idiot
really
believes
that
he
does
remember
.
   
<EOS>
"
Profiting
by
your
hint
,
"
pursues
Jasper
,
"
I
have
had
some
day
-
rambles
with
the
extraordinary
old
fellow
,
and
we
are
to
make
a
moonlight
hole
-
and
-
corner
exploration
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
here
he
is
,
"
says
the
Dean
.
   
<EOS>
Durdles
with
his
dinner
-
bundle
in
his
hand
,
is
indeed
beheld
slouching
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
Slouching
nearer
,
and
perceiving
the
Dean
,
he
pulls
off
his
hat
,
and
is
slouching
away
with
it
under
his
arm
,
when
Mr
Sapsea
stops
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mind
you
take
care
of
my
friend
,
"
is
the
injunction
Mr
Sapsea
lays
upon
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
friend
o
'
yourn
is
dead
?
"
asks
Durdles
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
orders
has
come
in
for
any
friend
o
'
yourn
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
my
live
friend
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
!
<EOS>
him
?
"
says
Durdles
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
can
take
care
of
himself
,
can
Mister
Jarsper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
take
care
of
him
too
,
"
says
Sapsea
.
   
<EOS>
Whom
Durdles
(
there
being
command
in
his
tone
)
<EOS>
surlily
surveys
from
head
to
foot
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
submission
to
his
Reverence
the
Dean
,
if
you
'll
mind
what
concerns
you
,
Mr
Sapsea
,
Durdles
<EOS>
he
'll
mind
what
concerns
him
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
're
out
of
temper
,
"
says
Mr
Sapsea
,
winking
to
the
company
to
observe
how
smoothly
he
will
manage
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
friend
concerns
me
,
and
Mr
Jasper
is
my
friend
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
are
my
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
get
into
a
bad
habit
of
boasting
,
"
retorts
Durdles
,
with
a
grave
cautionary
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
'll
grow
upon
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
out
of
temper
,
"
says
Sapsea
again
;
reddening
,
but
again
sinking
to
the
company
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
own
to
it
,
"
returns
Durdles
;
"
I
do
n't
like
liberties
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
winks
a
third
wink
to
the
company
,
as
who
should
say
:
"
I
think
you
will
agree
with
me
that
I
have
settled
HIS
business
;
"
and
stalks
out
of
the
controversy
.
   
<EOS>
Durdles
then
gives
the
Dean
a
good
evening
,
and
adding
,
as
he
puts
his
hat
on
,
"
You
'll
find
me
at
home
,
Mister
Jarsper
,
as
agreed
,
when
you
want
me
;
I
'm
a
-
going
home
to
clean
myself
,
"
soon
slouches
out
of
sight
.
 
<EOS>
This
going
home
to
clean
himself
is
one
of
the
man
's
incomprehensible
compromises
with
inexorable
facts
;
he
,
and
his
hat
,
and
his
boots
,
and
his
clothes
,
never
showing
any
trace
of
cleaning
,
but
being
uniformly
in
one
condition
of
dust
and
grit
.
   
<EOS>
The
lamplighter
now
dotting
the
quiet
Close
with
specks
of
light
,
and
running
at
a
great
rate
up
and
down
his
little
ladder
with
that
object
---
his
little
ladder
under
the
sacred
shadow
of
whose
inconvenience
generations
had
grown
up
,
and
which
all
Cloisterham
would
have
stood
aghast
at
the
idea
of
abolishing
---
the
Dean
withdraws
to
his
dinner
,
Mr
Tope
to
his
tea
,
and
Mr
Jasper
to
his
piano
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
with
no
light
but
that
of
the
fire
,
he
sits
chanting
choir
-
music
in
a
low
and
beautiful
voice
,
for
two
or
three
hours
;
in
short
,
until
it
has
been
for
some
time
dark
,
and
the
moon
is
about
to
rise
.
   
<EOS>
Then
he
closes
his
piano
softly
,
softly
changes
his
coat
for
a
pea
-
jacket
,
with
a
goodly
wicker
-
cased
bottle
in
its
largest
pocket
,
and
putting
on
a
low
-
crowned
,
flap
-
brimmed
hat
,
goes
softly
out
.
<EOS>
Why
does
he
move
so
softly
to
-
night
?
 
<EOS>
No
outward
reason
is
apparent
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Can
there
be
any
sympathetic
reason
crouching
darkly
within
him
?
   
<EOS>
Repairing
to
Durdles
's
unfinished
house
,
or
hole
in
the
city
wall
,
and
seeing
a
light
within
it
<EOS>
,
he
softly
picks
his
course
among
the
gravestones
,
monuments
,
and
stony
lumber
of
the
yard
,
already
touched
here
and
there
,
sidewise
,
by
the
rising
moon
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
journeymen
have
left
their
two
great
saws
sticking
in
their
blocks
of
stone
;
and
two
skeleton
journeymen
out
of
the
Dance
of
Death
might
be
grinning
in
the
shadow
of
their
sheltering
sentry
-
boxes
,
about
to
slash
away
at
cutting
out
the
gravestones
of
the
next
two
people
destined
to
die
in
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
Likely
enough
,
the
two
think
little
of
that
now
,
being
alive
,
and
perhaps
merry
.
 
<EOS>
Curious
,
to
make
a
guess
at
the
two
;
---
or
say
one
of
the
two
!
   
<EOS>
"
Ho
!
 
<EOS>
Durdles
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
light
moves
,
and
he
appears
with
it
at
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
seem
to
have
been
"
cleaning
himself
"
with
the
aid
of
a
bottle
,
jug
,
and
tumbler
;
for
no
other
cleansing
instruments
are
visible
in
the
bare
brick
room
with
rafters
overhead
and
no
plastered
ceiling
,
into
which
he
shows
his
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ready
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
,
Mister
Jarsper
.
 
<EOS>
Let
the
old
uns
come
out
if
they
dare
,
when
we
go
among
their
tombs
.
 
<EOS>
My
spirit
is
ready
for
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
mean
animal
spirits
,
or
ardent
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
one
's
the
t'other
,
"
answers
Durdles
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
mean
'em
both
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
takes
a
lantern
from
a
hook
,
puts
a
match
or
two
in
his
pocket
wherewith
to
light
it
,
should
there
be
need
;
and
they
go
out
together
,
dinner
-
bundle
and
all
.
   
<EOS>
Surely
an
unaccountable
sort
of
expedition
!
 
<EOS>
That
Durdles
himself
,
who
is
always
prowling
among
old
graves
,
and
ruins
,
like
a
Ghoul
---
that
he
should
be
stealing
forth
to
climb
,
and
dive
,
and
wander
without
an
object
,
is
nothing
extraordinary
;
but
that
the
Choir
-
Master
or
any
one
else
should
hold
it
worth
his
while
to
be
with
him
,
and
to
study
moonlight
effects
in
such
company
is
another
affair
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
an
unaccountable
sort
of
expedition
,
therefore
!
   
<EOS>
"
'
Ware
that
there
mound
by
the
yard
-
gate
,
Mister
Jarsper
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lime
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
stops
,
and
waits
for
him
to
come
up
,
for
he
lags
behind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
you
call
quick
-
lime
?
"
   
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
"
says
Durdles
;
"
quick
enough
to
eat
your
boots
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
little
handy
stirring
,
quick
enough
to
eat
your
bones
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
go
on
,
presently
passing
the
red
windows
of
the
Travellers
'
Twopenny
,
and
emerging
into
the
clear
moonlight
of
the
Monks
'
Vineyard
.
 
<EOS>
This
crossed
<EOS>
,
they
come
to
Minor
Canon
Corner
:
 
of
which
the
greater
part
lies
in
shadow
until
the
moon
shall
rise
higher
in
the
sky
.
   
<EOS>
The
sound
of
a
closing
house
-
door
strikes
their
ears
,
and
two
men
come
out
.
 
<EOS>
These
are
Mr
Crisparkle
and
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
,
with
a
strange
and
sudden
smile
upon
his
face
,
lays
the
palm
of
his
hand
upon
the
breast
of
Durdles
,
stopping
him
where
he
stands
.
   
<EOS>
At
that
end
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
the
shadow
is
profound
in
the
existing
state
of
the
light
:
 
at
that
end
,
too
,
there
is
a
piece
of
old
dwarf
wall
,
breast
high
,
the
only
remaining
boundary
of
what
was
once
a
garden
,
but
is
now
the
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
and
Durdles
would
have
turned
this
wall
in
another
instant
;
but
,
stopping
so
short
,
stand
behind
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Those
two
are
only
sauntering
,
"
Jasper
whispers
;
"
they
will
go
out
into
the
moonlight
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
keep
quiet
here
,
or
they
will
detain
us
,
or
want
to
join
us
,
or
what
not
.
"
   
<EOS>
Durdles
nods
assent
,
and
falls
to
munching
some
fragments
from
his
bundle
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
folds
his
arms
upon
the
top
of
the
wall
,
and
,
with
his
chin
resting
on
them
,
watches
.
 
<EOS>
He
takes
no
note
whatever
of
the
Minor
Canon
,
but
watches
Neville
,
as
though
his
eye
were
at
the
trigger
of
a
loaded
rifle
,
and
he
had
covered
him
,
and
were
going
to
fire
.
 
<EOS>
A
sense
of
destructive
power
is
so
expressed
in
his
face
,
that
even
Durdles
pauses
in
his
munching
,
and
looks
at
him
,
with
an
unmunched
something
in
his
cheek
.
   
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Mr
Crisparkle
and
Neville
walk
to
and
fro
,
quietly
talking
together
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
say
,
can
not
be
heard
consecutively
;
but
Mr
Jasper
has
already
distinguished
his
own
name
more
than
once
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
day
of
the
week
,
"
Mr
Crisparkle
can
be
distinctly
heard
to
observe
,
as
they
turn
back
;
"
and
the
last
day
of
the
week
is
Christmas
Eve
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
certain
of
me
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
echoes
were
favourable
at
those
points
,
but
as
the
two
approach
,
the
sound
of
their
talking
becomes
confused
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
word
"
confidence
,
"
shattered
by
the
echoes
,
but
still
capable
of
being
pieced
together
,
is
uttered
by
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
draw
still
nearer
,
this
fragment
of
a
reply
is
heard
:
 
"
Not
deserved
yet
,
but
shall
be
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
they
turn
away
again
,
Jasper
again
hears
his
own
name
,
in
connection
with
the
words
from
Mr
Crisparkle
:
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
that
I
said
I
answered
for
you
confidently
.
"
<EOS>
Then
the
sound
of
their
talk
becomes
confused
again
;
they
halting
for
a
little
while
,
and
some
earnest
action
on
the
part
of
Neville
succeeding
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
move
once
more
,
Mr
Crisparkle
is
seen
to
look
up
at
the
sky
,
and
to
point
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
slowly
disappear
;
passing
out
into
the
moonlight
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
Corner
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
until
they
are
gone
,
that
Mr
Jasper
moves
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
he
turns
to
Durdles
,
and
bursts
into
a
fit
of
laughter
.
 
<EOS>
Durdles
,
who
still
has
that
suspended
something
in
his
cheek
,
and
who
sees
nothing
to
laugh
at
,
stares
at
him
until
Mr
Jasper
lays
his
face
down
on
his
arms
to
have
his
laugh
out
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Durdles
bolts
the
something
,
as
if
desperately
resigning
himself
to
indigestion
.
   
<EOS>
Among
those
secluded
nooks
there
is
very
little
stir
or
movement
after
dark
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
little
enough
in
the
high
tide
of
the
day
,
but
there
is
next
to
none
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
that
the
cheerfully
frequented
High
Street
lies
nearly
parallel
to
the
spot
(
the
old
Cathedral
rising
between
the
two
)
,
and
is
the
natural
channel
in
which
the
Cloisterham
traffic
flows
,
a
certain
awful
hush
pervades
the
ancient
pile
,
the
cloisters
,
and
the
churchyard
,
after
dark
,
which
not
many
people
care
to
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
the
first
hundred
citizens
of
Cloisterham
,
met
at
random
in
the
streets
at
noon
,
if
they
believed
in
Ghosts
,
they
would
tell
you
no
;
but
put
them
to
choose
at
night
between
these
eerie
Precincts
and
the
thoroughfare
of
shops
,
and
you
would
find
that
ninety
-
nine
declared
for
the
longer
round
and
the
more
frequented
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
of
this
is
not
to
be
found
in
any
local
superstition
that
attaches
to
the
Precincts
---
<EOS>
albeit
a
mysterious
lady
,
with
a
child
in
her
arms
and
a
rope
dangling
from
her
neck
,
has
been
seen
flitting
about
there
by
sundry
witnesses
as
intangible
as
herself
---
but
it
is
to
be
sought
in
the
innate
shrinking
of
dust
with
the
breath
of
life
in
it
from
dust
out
of
which
the
breath
of
life
has
passed
;
also
,
in
the
widely
diffused
,
and
almost
as
widely
unacknowledged
,
reflection
:
 
"
<EOS>
If
the
dead
do
,
under
any
circumstances
,
become
visible
to
the
living
,
these
are
such
likely
surroundings
for
the
purpose
that
I
,
the
living
,
will
get
out
of
them
as
soon
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hence
,
when
Mr
Jasper
and
Durdles
pause
to
glance
around
them
,
before
descending
into
the
crypt
by
a
small
side
door
,
of
which
the
latter
has
a
key
,
the
whole
expanse
of
moonlight
in
their
view
is
utterly
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
One
might
fancy
that
the
tide
of
life
was
stemmed
by
Mr
Jasper
's
own
gatehouse
.
 
<EOS>
The
murmur
of
the
tide
is
heard
beyond
;
but
no
wave
passes
the
archway
,
over
which
his
lamp
burns
red
behind
his
curtain
,
as
if
the
building
were
a
Lighthouse
.
   
<EOS>
They
enter
,
locking
themselves
in
,
descend
the
rugged
steps
,
and
are
down
in
the
Crypt
.
 
<EOS>
The
lantern
is
not
wanted
,
for
the
moonlight
strikes
in
at
the
groined
windows
,
bare
of
glass
,
the
broken
frames
for
which
cast
patterns
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
The
heavy
pillars
which
support
the
roof
engender
masses
of
black
shade
,
but
between
them
there
are
lanes
of
light
.
 
<EOS>
Up
and
down
these
lanes
they
walk
,
Durdles
discoursing
of
the
"
old
uns
"
he
yet
counts
on
disinterring
,
and
slapping
a
wall
,
in
which
he
considers
"
a
whole
family
on
'em
"
to
be
stoned
and
earthed
up
,
just
as
if
he
were
a
familiar
friend
of
the
family
.
 
<EOS>
The
taciturnity
of
Durdles
is
for
the
time
overcome
by
Mr
Jasper
's
wicker
bottle
,
which
circulates
freely
;
---
in
the
sense
,
that
is
to
say
,
that
its
contents
enter
freely
into
Mr
Durdles
's
circulation
,
while
Mr
Jasper
only
rinses
his
mouth
once
,
and
casts
forth
the
rinsing
.
   
<EOS>
They
are
to
ascend
the
great
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
steps
by
which
they
rise
to
the
Cathedral
,
Durdles
pauses
for
new
store
of
breath
.
 
<EOS>
The
steps
are
very
dark
,
but
out
of
the
darkness
they
can
see
the
lanes
of
light
they
have
traversed
.
 
<EOS>
Durdles
seats
himself
upon
a
step
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
seats
himself
upon
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
odour
from
the
wicker
bottle
(
which
has
somehow
passed
into
Durdles
's
keeping
)
soon
intimates
that
the
cork
has
been
taken
out
;
but
this
is
not
ascertainable
through
the
sense
of
sight
,
since
neither
can
descry
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
in
talking
,
they
turn
to
one
another
,
as
though
their
faces
could
commune
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
good
stuff
,
Mister
Jarsper
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
good
stuff
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
---
I
bought
it
on
purpose
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
show
,
you
see
,
the
old
uns
do
n't
,
Mister
Jarsper
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
a
more
confused
world
than
it
is
,
if
they
could
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
WOULD
lead
towards
a
mixing
of
things
,
"
Durdles
acquiesces
:
 
pausing
on
the
remark
,
as
if
the
idea
of
ghosts
had
not
previously
presented
itself
to
him
in
a
merely
inconvenient
light
,
domestically
or
chronologically
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
think
there
may
be
Ghosts
of
other
things
,
though
not
of
men
and
women
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
things
?
 
<EOS>
Flower
-
beds
and
watering
-
pots
?
<EOS>
horses
and
harness
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
Sounds
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
sounds
?
"
   
"
Cries
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
cries
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
Chairs
to
mend
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
screeches
.
 
<EOS>
Now
I
'll
tell
you
,
Mr
Jarsper
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
a
bit
till
I
put
the
bottle
right
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
the
cork
is
evidently
taken
out
again
,
and
replaced
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
NOW
it
's
right
!
 
<EOS>
This
time
last
year
,
only
a
few
days
later
,
I
happened
to
have
been
doing
what
was
correct
by
the
season
,
in
the
way
of
giving
it
the
welcome
it
had
a
right
to
expect
,
when
them
town
-
boys
set
on
me
at
their
worst
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
I
gave
'em
the
slip
,
and
turned
in
here
.
 
<EOS>
And
here
I
fell
asleep
.
 
<EOS>
And
what
woke
me
?
 
<EOS>
The
ghost
of
a
cry
.
 
<EOS>
The
ghost
of
one
terrific
shriek
,
which
shriek
was
followed
by
the
ghost
of
the
howl
of
a
dog
:
 
a
long
,
dismal
,
woeful
howl
,
such
as
a
dog
gives
when
a
person
's
dead
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
MY
last
Christmas
Eve
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
is
the
very
abrupt
,
and
,
one
might
say
,
fierce
retort
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
made
inquiries
everywhere
about
,
and
,
that
no
living
ears
but
mine
heard
either
that
cry
or
that
howl
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
say
they
was
both
ghosts
;
though
why
they
came
to
me
,
I
've
never
made
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
another
kind
of
man
,
"
says
Jasper
,
scornfully
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
I
thought
myself
,
"
answers
Durdles
with
his
usual
composure
;
"
and
yet
I
was
picked
out
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
had
risen
suddenly
,
when
he
asked
him
what
he
meant
,
and
he
now
says
,
"
Come
;
we
shall
freeze
here
;
lead
the
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
Durdles
complies
,
not
over
-
steadily
;
opens
the
door
at
the
top
of
the
steps
with
the
key
he
has
already
used
;
and
so
emerges
on
the
Cathedral
level
,
in
a
passage
at
the
side
of
the
chancel
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
the
moonlight
is
so
very
bright
again
that
the
colours
of
the
nearest
stained
-
glass
window
are
thrown
upon
their
faces
.
 
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
unconscious
Durdles
,
holding
the
door
open
for
his
companion
to
follow
,
as
if
from
the
grave
,
is
ghastly
enough
,
with
a
purple
hand
across
his
face
,
and
a
yellow
splash
upon
his
brow
;
but
he
bears
the
close
scrutiny
of
his
companion
in
an
insensible
way
,
although
it
is
prolonged
while
the
latter
fumbles
among
his
pockets
for
a
key
confided
to
him
that
will
open
an
iron
gate
,
so
to
enable
them
to
pass
to
the
staircase
of
the
great
tower
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
and
the
bottle
are
enough
for
you
to
carry
,
"
he
says
,
giving
it
to
Durdles
;
"
hand
your
bundle
to
me
;
I
am
younger
and
longer
-
winded
than
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
Durdles
hesitates
for
a
moment
between
bundle
and
bottle
;
but
gives
the
preference
to
the
bottle
as
being
by
far
the
better
company
,
and
consigns
the
dry
weight
to
his
fellow
-
explorer
.
   
<EOS>
Then
they
go
up
the
winding
staircase
of
the
great
tower
,
toilsomely
,
turning
and
turning
,
and
lowering
their
heads
to
avoid
the
stairs
above
,
or
the
rough
stone
pivot
around
which
they
twist
.
<EOS>
Durdles
has
lighted
his
lantern
,
by
drawing
from
the
cold
,
hard
wall
a
spark
of
that
mysterious
fire
which
lurks
in
everything
,
and
,
guided
by
this
speck
,
they
clamber
up
among
the
cobwebs
and
the
dust
.
 
<EOS>
Their
way
lies
through
strange
places
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
or
thrice
<EOS>
they
emerge
into
level
,
low
-
arched
galleries
,
whence
they
can
look
down
into
the
moon
-
lit
nave
;
and
where
Durdles
,
waving
his
lantern
,
waves
the
dim
angels
'
heads
upon
the
corbels
of
the
roof
,
seeming
to
watch
their
progress
.
 
<EOS>
Anon
they
turn
into
narrower
and
steeper
staircases
,
and
the
night
-
air
begins
to
blow
upon
them
,
and
the
chirp
of
some
startled
jackdaw
or
frightened
rook
precedes
the
heavy
beating
of
wings
in
a
confined
space
,
and
the
beating
down
of
dust
and
straws
upon
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
leaving
their
light
behind
a
stair
---
for
it
blows
fresh
up
here
<EOS>
---
they
look
down
on
Cloisterham
,
fair
to
see
in
the
moonlight
:
 
its
ruined
habitations
and
sanctuaries
of
the
dead
,
at
the
tower
's
base
:
 
its
moss
-
softened
red
-
tiled
roofs
and
red
-
brick
houses
of
the
living
,
clustered
beyond
:
 
<EOS>
its
river
winding
down
from
the
mist
on
the
horizon
,
as
though
that
were
its
source
,
and
already
heaving
with
a
restless
knowledge
of
its
approach
towards
the
sea
.
   
<EOS>
Once
again
,
an
unaccountable
expedition
this
!
 
<EOS>
Jasper
(
always
moving
softly
with
no
visible
reason
)
contemplates
the
scene
,
and
especially
that
stillest
part
of
it
which
the
Cathedral
overshadows
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
contemplates
Durdles
quite
as
curiously
,
and
Durdles
is
by
times
conscious
of
his
watchful
eyes
.
   
<EOS>
Only
by
times
,
because
Durdles
is
growing
drowsy
.
 
<EOS>
As
aeronauts
lighten
the
load
they
carry
,
when
they
wish
to
rise
,
similarly
Durdles
has
lightened
the
wicker
bottle
in
coming
up
.
 
<EOS>
Snatches
of
sleep
surprise
him
on
his
legs
,
and
stop
him
in
his
talk
.
 
<EOS>
A
mild
fit
of
calenture
seizes
him
,
in
which
he
deems
that
the
ground
so
far
below
,
is
on
a
level
with
the
tower
,
and
would
as
lief
walk
off
the
tower
into
the
air
as
not
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
his
state
when
they
begin
to
come
down
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
aeronauts
make
themselves
heavier
when
they
wish
to
descend
,
similarly
Durdles
charges
himself
with
more
liquid
from
the
wicker
bottle
,
that
he
may
come
down
the
better
.
   
<EOS>
The
iron
gate
attained
and
locked
---
but
not
before
Durdles
has
tumbled
twice
,
and
cut
an
eyebrow
open
once
---
they
descend
into
the
crypt
again
,
with
the
intent
of
issuing
forth
as
they
entered
.
<EOS>
But
,
while
returning
among
those
lanes
of
light
,
Durdles
becomes
so
very
uncertain
,
both
of
foot
and
speech
,
that
he
half
drops
,
half
throws
himself
down
,
by
one
of
the
heavy
pillars
,
scarcely
less
heavy
than
itself
,
and
indistinctly
appeals
to
his
companion
for
forty
winks
of
a
second
each
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
have
it
so
,
or
must
have
it
so
,
"
replies
Jasper
,
"
I
'll
not
leave
you
here
.
 
<EOS>
Take
them
,
while
I
walk
to
and
fro
.
"
   
<EOS>
Durdles
is
asleep
at
once
;
and
in
his
sleep
he
dreams
a
dream
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
not
much
of
a
dream
,
considering
the
vast
extent
of
the
domains
of
dreamland
,
and
their
wonderful
productions
;
it
is
only
remarkable
for
being
unusually
restless
and
unusually
real
.
 
<EOS>
He
dreams
of
lying
there
,
asleep
,
and
yet
counting
his
companion
's
footsteps
as
he
walks
to
and
fro
.
 
<EOS>
He
dreams
that
the
footsteps
die
away
into
distance
of
time
and
of
space
,
and
that
something
touches
him
,
and
that
something
falls
from
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Then
something
clinks
and
gropes
about
,
and
he
dreams
that
he
is
alone
for
so
long
a
time
,
that
the
lanes
of
light
take
new
directions
as
the
moon
advances
in
her
course
.
 
<EOS>
From
succeeding
unconsciousness
he
passes
into
a
dream
of
slow
uneasiness
from
cold
;
and
painfully
awakes
to
a
perception
of
the
lanes
of
light
---
really
changed
,
much
as
he
had
dreamed
---
and
Jasper
walking
among
them
,
beating
his
hands
and
feet
.
   
<EOS>
"
Holloa
!
"
<EOS>
Durdles
cries
out
,
unmeaningly
alarmed
.
   
<EOS>
"
Awake
at
last
?
<EOS>
"
says
Jasper
,
coming
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
that
your
forties
have
stretched
into
thousands
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
have
though
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
time
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
 
<EOS>
The
bells
are
going
in
the
Tower
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
strike
four
quarters
,
and
then
the
great
bell
strikes
.
   
<EOS>
"
Two
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Durdles
,
scrambling
up
;
"
why
did
n't
you
try
to
wake
me
,
Mister
Jarsper
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
.
 
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
have
tried
to
wake
the
dead
---
your
own
family
of
dead
,
up
in
the
corner
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
touch
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Touch
you
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Shook
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
Durdles
recalls
that
touching
something
in
his
dream
,
he
looks
down
on
the
pavement
,
and
sees
the
key
of
the
crypt
door
lying
close
to
where
he
himself
lay
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
dropped
you
,
did
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
says
,
picking
it
up
,
and
recalling
that
part
of
his
dream
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
gathers
himself
up
again
into
an
upright
position
,
or
into
a
position
as
nearly
upright
as
he
ever
maintains
,
he
is
again
conscious
of
being
watched
by
his
companion
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
?
"
says
Jasper
,
smiling
,
"
are
you
quite
ready
?
 
<EOS>
Pray
do
n't
hurry
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
me
get
my
bundle
<EOS>
right
,
Mister
Jarsper
,
and
I
'm
with
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
ties
it
afresh
,
he
is
once
more
conscious
that
he
is
very
narrowly
observed
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
suspect
me
of
,
Mister
Jarsper
?
"
<EOS>
he
asks
,
with
drunken
displeasure
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
them
as
has
any
suspicions
of
Durdles
name
'
em
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
suspicions
of
you
,
my
good
Mr
Durdles
;
but
I
have
suspicions
that
my
bottle
was
filled
with
something
stiffer
than
either
of
us
supposed
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
also
have
suspicions
,
"
Jasper
adds
,
taking
it
from
the
pavement
and
turning
it
bottom
upwards
,
"
that
it
's
empty
.
"
   
<EOS>
Durdles
condescends
to
laugh
at
this
.
 
<EOS>
Continuing
to
chuckle
when
his
laugh
is
over
,
<EOS>
as
though
remonstrant
with
himself
on
his
drinking
powers
,
he
rolls
to
the
door
and
unlocks
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
pass
out
,
and
Durdles
relocks
it
,
and
pockets
his
key
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
thousand
thanks
for
a
curious
and
interesting
night
,
"
says
Jasper
,
giving
him
his
hand
;
"
you
can
make
your
own
way
home
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
so
!
"
<EOS>
answers
Durdles
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
was
to
offer
Durdles
the
affront
to
show
him
his
way
home
,
he
would
n't
go
home
.
   
<EOS>
Durdles
would
n't
go
home
till
morning
;
<EOS>
And
THEN
Durdles
would
n't
go
home
,
   
Durdles
would
n't
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
with
the
utmost
defiance
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
Mister
Jarsper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Each
is
turning
his
own
way
,
when
a
sharp
whistle
rends
the
silence
,
and
the
jargon
is
yelped
out
:
   
<EOS>
Widdy
widdy

<EOS>
I
---

<EOS>
Widdy
Widdy
Wake

cock
warning

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Instantly
afterwards
,
a
rapid
fire
of
stones
rattles
at
the
Cathedral
wall
,
and
the
hideous
small
boy
is
beheld
opposite
,
dancing
in
the
moonlight
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
!
 
<EOS>
Is
that
baby
-
devil
on
the
watch
there
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Jasper
in
a
fury
:
 
so
quickly
roused
,
and
so
violent
,
that
he
seems
an
older
devil
himself
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
shed
the
blood
of
that
impish
wretch
!
 
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
do
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
Regardless
of
the
fire
,
<EOS>
though
it
hits
him
more
than
once
,
he
rushes
at
Deputy
,
collars
him
,
and
tries
to
bring
him
across
.
 
<EOS>
But
Deputy
is
not
to
be
so
easily
brought
across
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
diabolical
insight
into
the
strongest
part
of
his
position
,
he
is
no
sooner
taken
by
the
throat
than
he
curls
up
his
legs
,
forces
his
assailant
to
hang
him
,
as
it
were
,
and
gurgles
in
his
throat
,
and
screws
his
body
,
and
twists
,
as
already
undergoing
the
first
agonies
of
strangulation
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
for
it
but
to
drop
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
instantly
gets
himself
together
,
backs
over
to
Durdles
,
and
cries
to
his
assailant
,
gnashing
the
great
gap
in
front
of
his
mouth
with
rage
and
malice
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
blind
yer
,
s'elp
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
'll
stone
yer
eyes
out
,
s'elp
me
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
have
yer
eyesight
,
bellows
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
dodging
behind
Durdles
,
and
snarling
at
Jasper
,
now
from
this
side
of
him
,
and
now
from
that
:
 
prepared
,
if
pounced
upon
,
to
dart
away
in
all
manner
of
curvilinear
directions
,
and
,
if
run
down
after
all
,
to
grovel
in
the
dust
,
and
cry
:
 
"
Now
,
hit
me
when
I
'm
down
!
 
<EOS>
Do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
hurt
the
boy
,
Mister
Jarsper
,
"
urges
Durdles
,
shielding
him
.
"
<EOS>
Recollect
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
followed
us
to
-
night
,
when
we
first
came
here
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yer

<EOS>
"
replies
Deputy
,
in
his
one
form
of
polite
contradiction
.
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
been
prowling
near
us
ever
since
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yer
lie
,
I
have

"
returns
Deputy
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd

"
   
<EOS>
(
with
the
usual
rhythm
and
dance
,
though
dodging
behind
Durdles
)
,
"
it
ai
n't
ANY
fault
,
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Take
him
home
,
then
,
"
retorts
Jasper
,
ferociously
,
though
with
a
strong
check
upon
himself
,
"
and
let
my
eyes
be
rid
of
the
sight
of
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
Deputy
,
with
another
sharp
whistle
,
at
once
expressing
his
relief
,
and
his
commencement
of
a
milder
stoning
of
Mr
Durdles
,
begins
stoning
that
respectable
gentleman
home
,
as
if
he
were
a
reluctant
ox
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
goes
to
his
gatehouse
,
brooding
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
,
as
everything
comes
to
an
end
,
the
unaccountable
expedition
comes
to
an
end
---
for
the
time
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
13
.
<EOS>
Both
at
their
best
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
's
establishment
was
about
to
undergo
a
serene
hush
.
<EOS>
The
Christmas
recess
was
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
What
had
once
,
and
at
no
remote
period
,
been
called
,
even
by
the
erudite
Miss
Twinkleton
herself
,
"
the
half
;
"
but
what
was
now
called
,
as
being
more
elegant
,
and
more
strictly
collegiate
,
"
the
term
,
"
would
expire
to
-
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
A
noticeable
relaxation
of
discipline
had
for
some
few
days
pervaded
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
Club
suppers
had
occurred
in
the
bedrooms
,
and
a
dressed
tongue
had
been
carved
with
a
pair
of
scissors
,
and
handed
round
with
the
curling
tongs
.
 
<EOS>
Portions
of
marmalade
had
likewise
been
distributed
on
a
service
of
plates
constructed
of
curlpaper
;
and
cowslip
wine
had
been
quaffed
from
the
small
squat
measuring
glass
in
which
little
Rickitts
(
a
junior
of
weakly
constitution
)
took
her
steel
drops
daily
.
 
<EOS>
The
housemaids
had
been
bribed
with
various
fragments
of
riband
,
and
sundry
pairs
of
shoes
more
or
less
down
at
heel
,
to
make
no
mention
of
crumbs
in
the
beds
;
the
airiest
costumes
had
been
worn
on
these
festive
occasions
;
and
the
daring
Miss
Ferdinand
had
even
surprised
the
company
with
a
sprightly
solo
on
the
comb
-
and
-
curlpaper
,
until
suffocated
in
her
own
pillow
by
two
flowing
-
haired
executioners
.
   
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
the
only
tokens
of
dispersal
.
 
<EOS>
Boxes
appeared
in
the
bedrooms
(
where
they
were
capital
at
other
times
)
,
and
a
surprising
amount
of
packing
took
place
,
out
of
all
proportion
to
the
amount
packed
.
 
<EOS>
Largess
,
in
the
form
of
odds
and
ends
of
cold
cream
and
pomatum
,
and
also
of
hairpins
,
was
freely
distributed
among
the
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
On
charges
of
inviolable
secrecy
,
confidences
were
interchanged
respecting
golden
youth
of
England
expected
to
call
,
"
at
home
,
"
on
the
first
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Giggles
(
deficient
in
sentiment
)
did
indeed
profess
that
she
,
for
her
part
,
acknowledged
such
homage
by
making
faces
at
the
golden
youth
;
but
this
young
lady
was
outvoted
by
an
immense
majority
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
last
night
before
a
recess
,
it
was
always
expressly
made
a
point
of
honour
that
nobody
should
go
to
sleep
,
and
that
Ghosts
should
be
encouraged
by
all
possible
means
.
 
<EOS>
This
compact
invariably
broke
down
,
and
all
the
young
ladies
went
to
sleep
very
soon
,
and
got
up
very
early
.
   
<EOS>
The
concluding
ceremony
came
off
at
twelve
o'clock
on
the
day
of
departure
;
when
Miss
Twinkleton
,
supported
by
Mrs
Tisher
,
held
a
drawing
-
room
in
her
own
apartment
(
the
globes
already
covered
with
brown
Holland
)
,
where
glasses
of
white
-
wine
and
plates
of
cut
pound
-
cake
were
discovered
on
the
table
.
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
then
said
:
 
Ladies
,
another
revolving
year
had
brought
us
round
to
that
festive
period
at
which
the
first
feelings
of
our
nature
bounded
in
our
---
Miss
Twinkleton
was
annually
going
to
add
"
bosoms
,
"
but
annually
stopped
on
the
brink
of
that
expression
,
and
substituted
"
hearts
.
"
 
<EOS>
Hearts
;
our
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
Again
a
revolving
year
,
ladies
,
had
brought
us
to
a
pause
in
our
studies
---
let
us
hope
our
greatly
advanced
studies
---
and
,
like
the
mariner
in
his
bark
,
the
warrior
in
his
tent
,
the
captive
in
his
dungeon
,
and
the
traveller
in
his
various
conveyances
,
we
yearned
for
home
.
 
<EOS>
Did
we
say
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
in
the
opening
words
of
Mr
Addison
's
impressive
tragedy
:
   
<EOS>
"
The
dawn
is
overcast
,
the
morning
lowers
,
And
heavily
in
clouds
brings
on
the
day
,
The
great
,
th
'
important
day
---
?
"
   
<EOS>
Not
so
.
 
<EOS>
From
horizon
to
zenith
all
was
COULEUR
DE
ROSE
,
for
all
was
redolent
of
our
relations
and
friends
.
 
<EOS>
Might
WE
find
THEM
prospering
as
WE
expected
;
might
THEY
find
US
prospering
as
THEY
expected
!
 
<EOS>
Ladies
,
we
would
now
,
with
our
love
to
one
another
,
wish
one
<EOS>
another
good
-
bye
,
and
happiness
,
until
we
met
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
time
should
come
for
our
resumption
of
those
pursuits
which
(
here
a
general
depression
set
in
all
round
)
,
pursuits
which
,
pursuits
which
;
---
then
let
us
ever
remember
what
was
said
by
the
Spartan
General
,
in
words
too
trite
for
repetition
,
at
the
battle
it
were
superfluous
to
specify
.
   
<EOS>
The
handmaidens
of
the
establishment
,
in
their
best
caps
,
then
handed
the
trays
,
and
the
young
ladies
sipped
and
crumbled
,
and
the
bespoken
coaches
began
to
choke
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Then
leave
-
taking
was
not
long
about
;
and
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
saluting
each
young
lady
's
cheek
,
confided
to
her
an
exceedingly
neat
letter
,
addressed
to
her
next
friend
at
law
,
"
with
Miss
Twinkleton
's
best
compliments
"
in
the
corner
.
 
<EOS>
This
missive
she
handed
with
an
air
as
if
it
had
not
the
least
connexion
with
the
bill
,
but
were
something
in
the
nature
of
a
delicate
and
joyful
surprise
.
   
<EOS>
So
many
times
had
Rosa
seen
such
dispersals
,
and
so
very
little
<EOS>
did
she
know
of
any
other
Home
,
that
she
was
contented
to
remain
where
she
was
,
and
was
even
better
contented
than
ever
before
,
having
her
latest
friend
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
her
latest
friendship
had
a
blank
place
in
it
of
which
she
could
not
fail
to
be
sensible
.
 
<EOS>
Helena
Landless
,
having
been
a
party
to
her
brother
's
revelation
about
Rosa
,
and
having
entered
into
that
compact
of
silence
with
Mr
Crisparkle
,
shrank
from
any
allusion
to
Edwin
Drood
's
name
.
 
<EOS>
Why
she
so
avoided
it
,
was
mysterious
to
Rosa
,
but
she
perfectly
perceived
the
fact
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
the
fact
,
she
might
have
relieved
her
own
little
perplexed
heart
of
some
of
its
doubts
and
hesitations
,
by
taking
Helena
into
her
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
had
no
such
vent
:
 
<EOS>
she
could
only
ponder
on
her
own
difficulties
,
and
wonder
more
and
more
why
this
avoidance
of
Edwin
's
name
should
last
,
now
that
she
knew
---
for
so
much
Helena
had
told
her
---
that
a
good
understanding
was
to
be
reestablished
between
the
two
young
men
,
when
Edwin
came
down
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
have
made
a
pretty
picture
,
so
many
pretty
girls
kissing
Rosa
in
the
cold
porch
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
that
sunny
little
creature
peeping
out
of
it
<EOS>
(
unconscious
of
sly
faces
carved
on
spout
and
gable
peeping
at
her
)
,
and
waving
farewells
to
the
departing
coaches
,
as
if
she
represented
the
spirit
of
rosy
youth
abiding
in
the
place
to
keep
it
bright
and
warm
in
its
desertion
.
<EOS>
The
hoarse
High
Street
became
musical
with
the
cry
,
in
various
silvery
voices
,
"
Good
-
bye
,
Rosebud
darling
!
"
and
the
effigy
of
Mr
Sapsea
's
father
over
the
opposite
doorway
seemed
to
say
to
mankind
:
"
Gentlemen
,
favour
me
with
your
attention
to
this
charming
little
last
lot
left
behind
,
and
bid
with
a
spirit
worthy
of
the
occasion
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
the
staid
street
,
so
unwontedly
sparkling
,
youthful
,
and
fresh
for
a
few
rippling
moments
,
ran
dry
,
and
Cloisterham
was
itself
again
.
   
<EOS>
If
Rosebud
in
her
bower
now
waited
Edwin
Drood
's
coming
with
an
uneasy
heart
,
Edwin
for
his
part
was
uneasy
too
.
 
<EOS>
With
far
less
force
of
purpose
in
his
composition
than
the
childish
beauty
,
crowned
by
acclamation
fairy
queen
of
Miss
Twinkleton
's
establishment
,
he
had
a
conscience
,
and
Mr
Grewgious
had
pricked
it
.
 
<EOS>
That
gentleman
's
steady
convictions
of
what
was
right
and
what
was
wrong
in
such
a
case
as
his
,
were
neither
to
be
frowned
aside
nor
laughed
aside
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
not
be
moved
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
the
dinner
in
Staple
Inn
,
and
but
for
the
ring
he
carried
in
the
breast
pocket
of
his
coat
,
he
would
have
drifted
into
their
wedding
-
day
without
another
pause
for
real
thought
,
loosely
trusting
that
all
would
go
well
,
left
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
serious
putting
him
on
his
truth
to
the
living
and
the
dead
had
brought
him
to
a
check
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
either
give
the
ring
to
Rosa
,
or
he
must
take
it
back
.
 
<EOS>
Once
put
into
this
narrowed
way
of
action
,
it
was
curious
that
he
began
to
consider
Rosa
's
claims
upon
him
more
unselfishly
than
he
had
ever
considered
them
before
,
and
began
to
be
less
sure
of
himself
than
he
had
ever
been
in
all
his
easy
-
going
days
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
guided
by
what
she
says
,
and
by
how
we
get
on
,
"
was
his
decision
,
walking
from
the
gatehouse
to
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whatever
comes
of
it
,
I
will
bear
his
words
in
mind
,
and
try
to
be
true
to
the
living
and
the
dead
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
was
dressed
for
walking
.
 
<EOS>
She
expected
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
,
frosty
day
,
and
Miss
Twinkleton
had
already
graciously
sanctioned
fresh
air
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
got
out
together
before
it
became
necessary
for
either
Miss
Twinkleton
,
or
the
deputy
high
-
priest
Mrs
Tisher
,
to
lay
even
so
much
as
one
of
those
usual
offerings
on
the
shrine
of
Propriety
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Eddy
,
"
said
Rosa
,
when
they
had
turned
out
of
the
High
Street
,
and
had
got
among
the
quiet
walks
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
Cathedral
and
the
river
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
say
something
very
serious
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
thinking
about
it
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
be
serious
with
you
too
,
<EOS>
Rosa
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
be
serious
and
earnest
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Eddy
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
will
not
think
me
unkind
because
I
begin
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
will
not
think
I
speak
for
myself
only
,
because
I
speak
first
?
 
<EOS>
That
would
not
be
generous
,
would
it
?
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
you
are
generous
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
I
hope
I
am
not
ungenerous
to
you
,
Rosa
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
called
her
Pussy
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
Never
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
there
is
no
fear
,
"
pursued
Rosa
,
"
of
our
quarrelling
,
is
there
?
 
<EOS>
Because
,
Eddy
,
"
clasping
her
hand
on
his
arm
,
"
we
have
so
much
reason
to
be
very
lenient
to
each
other
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
will
be
,
Rosa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
dear
good
boy
!
 
<EOS>
Eddy
,
let
us
be
courageous
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
change
to
brother
and
sister
from
this
day
forth
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
be
husband
and
wife
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
   
<EOS>
Neither
spoke
again
for
a
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
But
after
that
pause
he
said
,
with
some
effort
:
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
know
that
this
has
been
in
both
our
minds
,
Rosa
,
and
<EOS>
of
course
I
am
in
honour
bound
to
confess
freely
that
it
does
not
originate
with
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
nor
with
you
,
dear
,
"
she
returned
,
with
pathetic
earnestness
.
"
<EOS>
That
sprung
up
between
us
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
not
truly
happy
in
our
engagement
;
I
am
not
truly
happy
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
O
,
I
am
so
sorry
,
so
sorry
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
there
she
broke
into
tears
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
deeply
sorry
too
,
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
Deeply
sorry
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
for
you
,
poor
boy
!
 
<EOS>
And
I
for
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
This
pure
young
feeling
,
this
gentle
and
forbearing
feeling
of
each
towards
the
other
,
brought
with
it
its
reward
in
a
softening
light
that
seemed
to
shine
on
their
position
.
 
<EOS>
The
relations
between
them
did
not
look
wilful
,
or
capricious
,
or
a
failure
,
in
such
a
light
;
they
became
elevated
into
something
more
self
-
denying
,
honourable
,
affectionate
,
and
true
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
we
knew
yesterday
,
"
said
Rosa
,
as
she
dried
her
eyes
,
"
and
we
did
know
yesterday
,
and
on
many
,
many
yesterdays
,
that
we
were
far
from
right
together
in
those
relations
which
were
not
of
our
own
choosing
,
what
better
could
we
do
to
-
day
than
change
them
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
natural
that
we
should
be
sorry
,
and
you
see
how
sorry
we
both
are
;
but
how
much
better
to
be
sorry
now
than
then
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
it
would
be
too
late
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
we
should
be
angry
,
besides
.
"
   
<EOS>
Another
silence
fell
upon
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
,
"
said
Rosa
innocently
,
"
you
could
n't
like
me
then
;
and
you
can
always
like
me
now
,
for
I
shall
not
be
a
drag
upon
you
,
or
a
worry
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
can
always
like
you
now
,
and
your
sister
will
not
tease
or
trifle
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
often
did
when
I
was
not
your
sister
,
and
I
beg
your
pardon
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
us
come
to
that
,
Rosa
;
or
I
shall
want
more
pardoning
than
I
like
to
think
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
Eddy
;
you
are
too
hard
,
my
generous
boy
,
upon
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
sit
down
,
brother
,
on
these
ruins
,
and
let
me
tell
you
how
it
was
with
us
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
know
,
for
I
have
considered
about
it
very
much
since
you
were
here
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
You
liked
me
,
did
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
You
thought
I
was
a
nice
little
thing
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Everybody
thinks
that
,
Rosa
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
they
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
knitted
her
brow
musingly
for
a
moment
,
and
then
flashed
out
with
the
bright
little
induction
:
 
<EOS>
"
Well
,
but
say
they
do
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
it
was
not
enough
that
you
should
think
of
me
only
as
other
people
did
;
now
,
was
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
point
was
not
to
be
got
over
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
enough
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
is
just
what
I
mean
;
that
is
just
how
it
was
with
us
,
"
said
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
liked
me
very
well
,
and
you
had
grown
used
to
me
,
and
had
grown
used
to
the
idea
of
our
being
married
.
 
<EOS>
You
accepted
the
situation
as
an
inevitable
kind
of
thing
,
did
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
It
was
to
be
,
you
thought
,
and
why
discuss
or
dispute
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
new
and
strange
to
him
to
have
himself
presented
to
himself
so
clearly
,
in
a
glass
of
her
holding
up
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
always
patronised
her
,
in
his
superiority
to
her
share
of
woman
's
wit
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
but
another
instance
of
something
radically
amiss
in
the
terms
on
which
they
had
been
gliding
towards
a
life
-
long
bondage
?
   
<EOS>
"
All
this
that
I
say
of
you
is
true
of
me
as
well
,
Eddy
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
it
was
,
I
might
not
be
bold
enough
to
say
it
.
 
<EOS>
Only
,
the
difference
between
us
was
,
that
by
little
and
little
there
crept
into
my
mind
a
habit
of
thinking
about
it
,
instead
of
dismissing
it
.
 
<EOS>
My
life
is
not
so
busy
as
yours
,
you
see
,
and
I
have
not
so
many
things
to
think
of
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
thought
about
it
very
much
,
and
I
cried
about
it
very
much
too
(
though
that
was
not
your
fault
,
poor
boy
)
;
when
all
at
once
my
guardian
came
down
,
to
prepare
for
my
leaving
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
I
tried
to
hint
to
him
that
I
was
not
quite
settled
in
my
mind
,
but
I
hesitated
and
failed
,
and
he
did
n't
understand
me
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
a
good
,
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
put
before
me
so
kindly
,
<EOS>
and
yet
so
strongly
,
how
seriously
we
ought
to
consider
,
in
our
circumstances
,
that
I
resolved
to
speak
to
you
the
next
moment
we
were
alone
and
grave
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
seemed
to
come
to
it
easily
just
now
,
because
I
came
to
it
all
at
once
,
do
n't
think
it
was
so
really
,
Eddy
,
for
O
<EOS>
,
it
was
very
,
very
hard
,
and
O
,
I
am
very
,
very
sorry
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
full
heart
broke
into
tears
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
,
and
they
walked
by
the
river
-
side
together
.
   
<EOS>
"
Your
guardian
has
spoken
to
me
too
,
Rosa
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
before
I
left
London
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
right
hand
was
in
his
breast
,
seeking
the
ring
;
but
he
checked
it
,
as
he
thought
:
 
"
If
I
am
to
take
it
back
,
why
should
I
tell
her
of
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
that
made
you
more
serious
about
it
,
did
n't
it
,
Eddy
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
I
had
not
spoken
to
you
,
as
I
have
,
you
would
have
spoken
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
can
tell
me
so
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
it
to
be
ALL
my
doing
,
though
it
IS
so
much
better
for
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
should
have
spoken
;
I
should
have
put
everything
before
you
;
I
came
intending
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
never
could
have
spoken
to
you
as
you
have
spoken
to
me
,
Rosa
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
you
mean
so
coldly
or
unkindly
,
Eddy
,
please
,
if
you
can
help
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
so
sensibly
and
delicately
,
so
wisely
and
affectionately
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
my
dear
brother
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
kissed
his
hand
in
a
little
rapture
.
<EOS>
"
The
dear
girls
will
be
dreadfully
disappointed
,
"
added
Rosa
,
laughing
,
with
the
dewdrops
glistening
in
her
bright
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
have
looked
forward
to
it
so
,
poor
pets
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
I
fear
it
will
be
a
worse
disappointment
to
Jack
,
"
said
Edwin
Drood
,
with
a
start
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
Jack
!
"
   
<EOS>
Her
swift
and
intent
look
at
him
as
he
said
the
words
could
no
more
be
recalled
than
a
flash
of
lightning
can
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
appeared
as
though
she
would
have
instantly
recalled
it
,
if
she
could
;
for
she
looked
down
,
confused
,
and
breathed
quickly
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
doubt
its
being
a
blow
to
Jack
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
merely
replied
,
and
that
evasively
and
hurriedly
:
 
<EOS>
Why
should
she
?
 
<EOS>
She
had
not
thought
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
,
to
her
,
to
have
so
little
to
do
with
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
!
<EOS>
can
you
suppose
that
any
one
so
wrapped
up
in
another
---
Mrs
Tope
's
expression
:
 
not
mine
---
as
Jack
is
in
me
,
could
fail
to
be
struck
all
of
a
heap
by
such
a
sudden
and
complete
change
in
my
life
?
 
<EOS>
I
say
sudden
,
because
it
will
be
sudden
to
HIM
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
She
nodded
twice
or
thrice
,
and
her
lips
parted
as
if
she
would
have
assented
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
uttered
no
sound
,
and
her
breathing
was
no
slower
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
shall
I
tell
Jack
?
"
said
Edwin
,
ruminating
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
less
occupied
with
the
thought
,
he
must
have
seen
her
singular
emotion
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
never
thought
of
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
broken
to
him
,
before
the
town
-
crier
knows
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
dine
with
the
dear
fellow
to
-
morrow
and
next
day
---
Christmas
Eve
and
Christmas
Day
---
but
it
would
never
do
to
spoil
his
feast
-
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
worries
about
me
,
and
moddley
-
coddleys
in
the
merest
trifles
.
 
<EOS>
The
news
is
sure
to
overset
him
.
 
<EOS>
How
on
earth
shall
this
be
broken
to
Jack
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
told
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Rosa
!
<EOS>
who
ought
to
be
in
our
confidence
,
if
not
Jack
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
guardian
promised
to
come
down
,
if
I
should
write
and
ask
him
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
do
so
.
 
<EOS>
Would
you
like
to
leave
it
to
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
bright
idea
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Edwin
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
other
trustee
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
more
natural
.
 
<EOS>
He
comes
down
,
he
goes
to
Jack
,
he
relates
what
we
have
agreed
upon
,
and
he
states
our
case
better
than
we
could
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
already
spoken
feelingly
to
you
,
he
has
already
spoken
feelingly
to
me
,
and
he
'll
put
the
whole
thing
feelingly
to
Jack
.
 
<EOS>
That
's
it
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
coward
,
Rosa
,
but
to
tell
you
a
secret
,
I
am
a
little
afraid
of
Jack
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
you
are
not
afraid
of
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosa
,
turning
white
,
and
clasping
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sister
Rosa
,
sister
Rosa
,
what
do
you
see
from
the
turret
?
"
said
Edwin
,
rallying
her
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
dear
girl
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
frightened
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Most
unintentionally
,
but
I
am
as
sorry
as
if
I
had
meant
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
Could
you
possibly
suppose
for
a
moment
,
from
any
loose
way
of
speaking
of
mine
,
that
I
was
literally
afraid
of
the
dear
fond
fellow
?
 
<EOS>
What
I
mean
is
,
that
he
is
subject
to
a
kind
of
paroxysm
,
or
fit
<EOS>
---
I
saw
him
in
it
once
---
and
I
do
n't
know
<EOS>
but
that
so
great
a
surprise
,
coming
upon
him
direct
from
me
whom
he
is
so
wrapped
up
in
,
might
bring
it
on
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
Which
---
and
this
is
the
secret
<EOS>
I
was
going
to
tell
you
---
is
another
reason
for
your
guardian
's
making
the
communication
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
so
steady
,
precise
,
and
exact
,
that
he
will
talk
Jack
's
thoughts
into
shape
,
in
no
time
:
 
whereas
with
me
Jack
is
always
impulsive
and
hurried
,
and
,
I
may
say
,
almost
womanish
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
seemed
convinced
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
from
her
own
very
different
point
of
view
of
"
Jack
,
"
she
felt
comforted
and
protected
by
the
interposition
of
Mr
Grewgious
between
herself
and
him
.
   
<EOS>
And
now
,
Edwin
Drood
's
right
hand
closed
again
upon
the
ring
in
its
little
case
,
and
again
was
checked
by
the
consideration
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
certain
,
now
,
that
I
am
to
give
it
back
to
him
;
then
why
should
I
tell
her
of
it
?
"
 
<EOS>
That
pretty
sympathetic
nature
which
could
be
so
sorry
for
him
in
the
blight
of
their
childish
hopes
of
happiness
together
,
and
could
so
quietly
find
itself
alone
in
a
new
world
to
weave
fresh
wreaths
of
such
flowers
as
it
might
prove
to
bear
,
the
old
world
's
flowers
being
withered
,
would
be
grieved
by
those
sorrowful
jewels
;
and
to
what
purpose
?
 
<EOS>
Why
should
it
be
?
 
<EOS>
They
were
but
a
sign
of
broken
joys
and
baseless
projects
;
in
their
very
beauty
they
were
(
as
the
unlikeliest
of
men
had
said
)
<EOS>
almost
a
cruel
satire
on
the
loves
,
hopes
,
plans
,
of
humanity
,
which
are
able
to
forecast
nothing
,
and
are
so
much
brittle
dust
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
be
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
restore
them
to
her
guardian
when
he
came
down
;
he
in
his
turn
would
restore
them
to
the
cabinet
from
which
he
had
unwillingly
taken
them
;
and
there
,
like
old
letters
or
old
vows
,
or
other
records
of
old
aspirations
come
to
nothing
,
they
would
be
disregarded
,
until
,
being
valuable
,
they
were
sold
into
circulation
again
,
to
repeat
their
former
round
.
   
<EOS>
Let
them
be
.
 
<EOS>
Let
them
lie
unspoken
of
,
in
his
breast
.
 
<EOS>
However
distinctly
or
indistinctly
he
entertained
these
thoughts
,
he
arrived
at
the
conclusion
,
Let
them
be
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
mighty
store
of
wonderful
chains
that
are
for
ever
forging
,
day
and
night
,
in
the
vast
iron
-
works
of
time
and
circumstance
,
there
was
one
chain
forged
in
the
moment
of
that
small
conclusion
,
riveted
to
the
foundations
of
heaven
and
earth
,
and
gifted
with
invincible
force
to
hold
and
drag
.
   
<EOS>
They
walked
on
by
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
They
began
to
speak
of
their
separate
plans
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
quicken
his
departure
from
England
,
and
she
would
remain
where
she
was
,
at
least
as
long
as
Helena
remained
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
dear
girls
should
have
their
disappointment
broken
to
them
gently
,
and
,
as
the
first
preliminary
,
Miss
Twinkleton
should
be
confided
in
by
Rosa
,
even
in
advance
of
the
reappearance
of
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
be
made
clear
in
all
quarters
that
she
and
Edwin
were
the
best
of
friends
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
never
been
so
serene
an
understanding
between
them
since
they
were
first
affianced
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
one
reservation
on
each
side
;
on
hers
,
that
she
intended
through
her
guardian
to
withdraw
herself
immediately
from
the
tuition
of
her
music
-
master
;
on
his
,
that
he
did
already
entertain
some
wandering
speculations
whether
it
might
ever
come
to
pass
that
he
would
know
more
of
Miss
Landless
.
   
<EOS>
The
bright
,
frosty
day
declined
as
they
walked
and
spoke
together
.
<EOS>
The
sun
dipped
in
the
river
far
behind
them
,
and
the
old
city
lay
red
before
them
,
as
their
walk
drew
to
a
close
.
 
<EOS>
The
moaning
water
cast
its
seaweed
duskily
at
their
feet
,
when
they
turned
to
leave
its
margin
;
and
the
rooks
hovered
above
them
with
hoarse
cries
,
darker
splashes
in
the
darkening
air
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
prepare
Jack
for
my
flitting
soon
,
"
said
Edwin
,
in
a
low
voice
,
"
and
I
will
but
see
your
guardian
when
he
comes
,
and
then
go
before
they
speak
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
will
be
better
done
without
my
being
by
.
 
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
know
we
have
done
right
,
Rosa
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
know
we
are
better
so
,
even
now
?
"
   
"
And
shall
be
far
,
far
better
so
by
-
and
-
by
.
"
   
<EOS>
Still
there
was
that
lingering
tenderness
in
their
hearts
towards
the
old
positions
they
were
relinquishing
,
that
they
prolonged
their
parting
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
among
the
elm
-
trees
by
the
Cathedral
,
where
they
had
last
sat
together
,
they
stopped
as
by
consent
,
and
Rosa
raised
her
face
to
his
,
as
she
had
never
raised
it
in
the
old
days
;
---
for
they
were
old
already
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
you
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
kissed
each
other
fervently
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
please
take
me
home
,
Eddy
,
and
let
me
be
by
myself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
round
,
Rosa
,
"
he
cautioned
her
,
as
he
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
and
led
her
away
.
 
<EOS>
"
Did
n't
you
see
Jack
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
!
 
<EOS>
Where
?
"
   
"
Under
the
trees
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
us
,
as
we
took
leave
of
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
he
little
thinks
we
have
parted
.
 
<EOS>
This
will
be
a
blow
to
him
,
I
am
much
afraid
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
hurried
on
,
without
resting
,
and
hurried
on
until
they
had
passed
under
the
gatehouse
into
the
street
;
once
there
,
she
asked
:
   
"
<EOS>
Has
he
followed
us
?
 
<EOS>
You
can
look
without
seeming
to
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
behind
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
is
!
 
<EOS>
He
has
just
passed
out
under
the
gateway
.
 
<EOS>
The
dear
,
sympathetic
old
fellow
likes
to
keep
us
in
sight
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
will
be
bitterly
disappointed
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
pulled
hurriedly
at
the
handle
of
the
hoarse
old
bell
,
and
the
gate
soon
opened
.
 
<EOS>
Before
going
in
,
she
gave
him
one
last
,
wide
<EOS>
,
wondering
look
,
as
if
she
would
have
asked
him
with
imploring
emphasis
:
 
"
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
do
n't
you
understand
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
out
of
that
look
he
vanished
from
her
view
.

Chapter

.
<EOS>
When
shall
these
three
meet
again
?
 
<EOS>
Christmas
Eve
in
Cloisterham
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
strange
faces
in
the
streets
;
a
few
other
faces
,
half
strange
and
half
familiar
,
once
the
faces
of
Cloisterham
children
,
now
the
faces
of
men
and
women
who
come
back
from
the
outer
world
at
long
intervals
to
find
the
city
wonderfully
shrunken
in
size
,
as
if
it
had
not
washed
by
any
means
well
in
the
meanwhile
.
 
<EOS>
To
these
,
the
striking
of
the
Cathedral
clock
,
and
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
from
the
Cathedral
tower
,
are
like
voices
of
their
nursery
time
.
 
<EOS>
To
such
as
these
,
it
has
happened
in
their
dying
hours
afar
off
,
that
they
have
imagined
their
chamber
-
floor
to
be
strewn
with
the
autumnal
leaves
fallen
from
the
elm
-
trees
in
the
Close
:
 
<EOS>
so
have
the
rustling
sounds
and
fresh
scents
of
their
earliest
impressions
revived
when
the
circle
of
their
lives
was
very
nearly
traced
,
and
the
beginning
and
the
end
were
drawing
close
together
.
   
<EOS>
Seasonable
tokens
are
about
.
 
<EOS>
Red
berries
shine
here
and
there
in
the
lattices
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
;
Mr
and
Mrs
Tope
are
daintily
sticking
sprigs
of
holly
into
the
carvings
and
sconces
of
the
Cathedral
stalls
,
as
if
they
were
sticking
them
into
the
coat
-
button
-
holes
of
the
Dean
and
Chapter
.
 
<EOS>
Lavish
profusion
is
in
the
shops
:
 
particularly
in
the
articles
of
currants
,
raisins
,
spices
,
candied
peel
,
and
moist
sugar
.
 
<EOS>
An
unusual
air
of
gallantry
and
dissipation
is
abroad
;
evinced
in
an
immense
bunch
of
mistletoe
hanging
in
the
greengrocer
's
shop
doorway
,
and
a
poor
little
Twelfth
Cake
,
culminating
in
the
figure
of
a
Harlequin
---
such
a
very
poor
little
Twelfth
Cake
,
that
one
would
rather
called
it
a
Twenty
-
fourth
Cake
or
a
Forty
-
eighth
Cake
---
to
be
raffled
for
at
the
pastrycook
's
,
terms
one
shilling
per
member
.
 
<EOS>
Public
amusements
are
not
wanting
.
 
<EOS>
The
Wax
-
Work
which
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
the
reflective
mind
of
the
Emperor
of
China
is
to
be
seen
by
particular
desire
during
Christmas
Week
only
,
on
the
premises
of
the
bankrupt
livery
-
stable
-
keeper
up
the
lane
;
and
a
new
grand
comic
Christmas
pantomime
is
to
be
produced
at
the
Theatre
:
 
<EOS>
the
latter
heralded
by
the
portrait
of
Signor
Jacksonini
the
clown
,
saying
"
How
do
you
do
to
-
morrow
?
"
quite
as
large
as
life
,
and
almost
as
miserably
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
Cloisterham
is
up
and
doing
:
though
from
this
description
the
High
School
and
Miss
Twinkleton
's
are
to
be
excluded
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
former
establishment
the
scholars
have
gone
home
,
every
one
of
them
in
love
with
one
of
Miss
Twinkleton
's
young
ladies
(
who
knows
nothing
about
it
)
;
and
only
the
handmaidens
flutter
occasionally
in
the
windows
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
It
is
noticed
,
by
the
bye
,
that
these
damsels
become
,
within
the
limits
of
decorum
,
more
skittish
when
thus
intrusted
with
the
concrete
representation
of
their
sex
,
than
when
dividing
the
representation
with
Miss
Twinkleton
's
young
ladies
.
   
<EOS>
Three
are
to
meet
at
the
gatehouse
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
How
does
each
one
of
the
three
get
through
the
day
?
   
<EOS>
Neville
Landless
,
though
absolved
from
his
books
for
the
time
by
Mr
Crisparkle
---
whose
fresh
nature
is
by
no
means
insensible
to
the
charms
of
a
holiday
---
reads
and
writes
in
his
quiet
room
,
with
a
concentrated
air
,
until
it
is
two
hours
past
noon
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
sets
himself
to
clearing
his
table
,
to
arranging
his
books
,
and
to
tearing
up
and
burning
his
stray
papers
.
 
<EOS>
He
makes
a
clean
sweep
of
all
untidy
accumulations
,
puts
all
his
drawers
in
order
,
and
leaves
no
note
or
scrap
of
paper
undestroyed
,
save
such
memoranda
as
bear
directly
on
his
studies
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
turns
to
his
wardrobe
,
selects
a
few
articles
of
ordinary
wear
---
among
them
,
change
of
stout
shoes
and
socks
for
walking
---
and
packs
these
in
a
knapsack
.
<EOS>
This
knapsack
is
new
,
and
he
bought
it
in
the
High
Street
yesterday
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
purchased
,
at
the
same
time
and
at
the
same
place
,
a
heavy
walking
-
stick
;
strong
in
the
handle
for
the
grip
of
the
hand
,
and
iron
-
shod
.
 
<EOS>
He
tries
this
,
swings
it
,
poises
it
,
and
lays
it
by
,
with
the
knapsack
,
on
a
window
-
seat
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
his
arrangements
are
complete
.
   
<EOS>
He
dresses
for
going
out
,
and
is
in
the
act
of
going
---
indeed
has
left
his
room
,
and
has
met
the
Minor
Canon
on
the
staircase
,
coming
out
of
his
bedroom
upon
the
same
story
---
when
he
turns
back
again
for
his
walking
-
stick
,
thinking
he
will
carry
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
who
has
paused
on
the
staircase
,
sees
it
in
his
hand
on
his
immediately
reappearing
,
takes
it
from
him
,
and
asks
him
with
a
smile
how
he
chooses
a
stick
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Really
I
do
n't
know
that
I
understand
the
subject
,
"
he
answers
.
<EOS>
"
I
chose
it
for
its
weight
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Much
too
heavy
,
Neville
;
MUCH
too
heavy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
To
rest
upon
in
a
long
walk
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Rest
upon
?
<EOS>
"
repeats
Mr
Crisparkle
,
throwing
himself
into
pedestrian
form
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
rest
upon
it
;
you
merely
balance
with
it

"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
know
better
,
with
practice
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
not
lived
in
a
walking
country
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
,
"
says
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Get
into
a
little
training
,
and
we
will
have
a
few
score
miles
together
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
leave
you
nowhere
now
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
come
back
before
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
not
,
as
we
dine
early
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
gives
him
a
bright
nod
and
a
cheerful
good
-
bye
;
expressing
(
not
without
intention
)
absolute
confidence
and
ease
   
Neville
repairs
to
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
requests
that
Miss
Landless
may
be
informed
that
her
brother
is
there
,
by
appointment
.
 
<EOS>
He
waits
at
the
gate
,
not
even
crossing
the
threshold
;
for
he
is
on
his
parole
not
to
put
himself
in
Rosa
's
way
.
   
<EOS>
His
sister
is
at
least
as
mindful
of
the
obligation
they
have
taken
on
themselves
as
he
can
be
,
and
loses
not
a
moment
in
joining
him
.
<EOS>
They
meet
affectionately
,
avoid
lingering
there
,
and
walk
towards
the
upper
inland
country
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
going
to
tread
upon
forbidden
ground
,
Helena
,
"
says
Neville
,
when
they
have
walked
some
distance
and
are
turning
;
"
you
will
understand
in
another
moment
that
I
can
not
help
referring
to
---
what
shall
I
say
?
---
my
infatuation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Had
you
not
better
avoid
it
,
Neville
?
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
can
hear
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
hear
,
my
dear
,
what
Mr
Crisparkle
has
heard
,
and
heard
with
approval
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
can
hear
so
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
it
is
this
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
only
unsettled
and
unhappy
myself
,
but
I
am
conscious
of
unsettling
and
interfering
with
other
people
.
<EOS>
How
do
I
know
that
,
but
for
my
unfortunate
presence
,
you
,
and
---
and
---
the
rest
of
that
former
party
,
our
engaging
guardian
excepted
,
might
be
dining
cheerfully
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
to
-
morrow
?
 
<EOS>
Indeed
it
probably
would
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
see
too
well
that
I
am
not
high
in
the
old
lady
's
opinion
,
and
it
is
easy
to
understand
what
an
irksome
clog
I
must
be
upon
the
hospitalities
of
her
orderly
house
---
especially
at
this
time
of
year
---
when
I
must
be
kept
asunder
from
this
person
,
and
there
is
such
a
reason
for
my
not
being
brought
into
contact
with
that
person
,
and
an
unfavourable
reputation
has
preceded
me
with
such
another
person
;
and
so
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
put
this
very
gently
to
Mr
Crisparkle
,
for
you
know
his
self
-
denying
ways
;
but
still
I
have
put
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
have
laid
much
greater
stress
upon
at
the
same
time
is
,
that
I
am
engaged
in
a
miserable
struggle
with
myself
,
and
that
a
little
change
and
absence
may
enable
me
to
come
through
it
the
better
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
weather
being
bright
and
hard
,
I
am
going
on
a
walking
expedition
,
and
intend
taking
myself
out
of
everybody
's
way
(
my
own
included
,
I
hope
)
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
to
come
back
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
going
quite
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
much
better
without
company
,
even
if
there
were
any
one
<EOS>
but
you
to
bear
me
company
,
my
dear
Helena
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Crisparkle
entirely
agrees
,
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Entirely
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
but
that
at
first
he
was
inclined
to
think
it
rather
a
moody
scheme
,
and
one
that
might
do
a
brooding
mind
harm
.
 
<EOS>
But
we
took
a
moonlight
walk
last
Monday
night
,
to
talk
it
over
at
leisure
,
and
I
represented
the
case
to
him
as
it
really
is
.
 
<EOS>
I
showed
him
that
I
do
want
to
conquer
myself
,
and
that
,
this
evening
well
got
over
,
it
is
surely
better
that
I
should
be
away
from
here
just
now
,
than
here
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
hardly
help
meeting
certain
people
walking
together
here
,
and
that
could
do
no
good
,
and
is
certainly
not
the
way
to
forget
.
 
<EOS>
A
fortnight
hence
,
that
chance
will
probably
be
over
,
for
the
time
;
and
when
it
again
arises
for
the
last
time
,
why
,
I
can
again
go
away
.
 
<EOS>
Farther
,
I
really
do
feel
hopeful
of
bracing
exercise
and
wholesome
fatigue
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
Mr
Crisparkle
allows
such
things
their
full
weight
in
the
preservation
of
his
own
sound
mind
in
his
own
sound
body
,
and
that
his
just
spirit
is
not
likely
to
maintain
one
set
of
natural
laws
for
himself
and
another
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
He
yielded
to
my
view
of
the
matter
,
when
convinced
that
I
was
honestly
in
earnest
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
with
his
full
consent
,
I
start
to
-
morrow
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Early
enough
to
be
not
only
out
of
the
streets
,
but
out
of
hearing
of
the
bells
,
when
the
good
people
go
to
church
.
"
   
<EOS>
Helena
thinks
it
over
,
and
thinks
well
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
doing
so
<EOS>
,
she
would
do
so
;
but
she
does
originally
,
out
of
her
own
mind
,
think
well
of
it
,
as
a
healthy
project
,
denoting
a
sincere
endeavour
and
an
active
attempt
at
self
-
correction
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
inclined
to
pity
him
,
poor
fellow
,
for
going
away
solitary
on
the
great
Christmas
festival
;
but
she
feels
it
much
more
to
the
purpose
to
encourage
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
does
encourage
him
.
   
<EOS>
He
will
write
to
her
?
   
<EOS>
He
will
write
to
her
every
alternate
day
,
and
tell
her
all
his
adventures
.
   
<EOS>
Does
he
send
clothes
on
in
advance
of
him
?
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
dear
Helena
,
no
.
 
Travel
like
a
pilgrim
,
with
wallet
and
staff
.
<EOS>
My
wallet
---
or
my
knapsack
---
is
packed
,
and
ready
for
strapping
on
;
and
here
is
my
staff
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
hands
it
to
her
;
she
makes
the
same
remark
as
Mr
Crisparkle
,
that
it
is
very
heavy
;
and
gives
it
back
to
him
,
asking
what
wood
it
is
?
 
<EOS>
Iron
-
wood
.
   
<EOS>
Up
to
this
point
he
has
been
extremely
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
the
having
to
carry
his
case
with
her
,
and
therefore
to
present
it
in
its
brightest
aspect
,
has
roused
his
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
the
having
done
so
with
success
,
is
followed
by
a
revulsion
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
day
closes
in
,
and
the
city
-
lights
begin
to
spring
up
before
them
,
he
grows
depressed
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
were
not
going
to
this
dinner
,
Helena
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Dear
Neville
,
is
it
worth
while
to
care
much
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
Think
how
soon
it
will
be
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
soon
it
will
be
over
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeats
gloomily
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
like
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
moment
's
awkwardness
,
she
cheeringly
represents
to
him
,
but
it
can
only
last
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
quite
sure
of
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
felt
as
sure
of
everything
else
,
as
I
feel
of
myself
,
"
he
answers
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
strangely
you
speak
,
dear
!
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
Helena
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
I
do
n't
like
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
strange
dead
weight
there
is
in
the
air
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
calls
his
attention
to
those
copperous
clouds
beyond
the
river
,
and
says
that
the
wind
is
rising
.
 
<EOS>
He
scarcely
speaks
again
,
until
he
takes
leave
of
her
,
at
the
gate
of
the
Nuns
'
House
.
 
<EOS>
She
does
not
immediately
enter
,
when
they
have
parted
,
but
remains
looking
after
him
along
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
he
passes
the
gatehouse
,
reluctant
to
enter
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
Cathedral
clock
chiming
one
quarter
,
with
a
rapid
turn
he
hurries
in
.
   
<EOS>
And
so
HE
goes
up
the
postern
stair
.
   
<EOS>
Edwin
Drood
passes
a
solitary
day
.
 
<EOS>
Something
of
deeper
moment
than
he
had
thought
,
has
gone
out
of
his
life
;
and
in
the
silence
of
his
own
chamber
he
wept
for
it
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
image
of
Miss
Landless
still
hovers
in
the
background
of
his
mind
,
the
pretty
little
affectionate
creature
,
so
much
firmer
and
wiser
than
he
had
supposed
,
occupies
its
stronghold
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
with
some
misgiving
of
his
own
unworthiness
that
he
thinks
of
her
,
and
of
what
they
might
have
been
to
one
another
,
if
he
had
been
more
in
earnest
some
time
ago
;
if
he
had
set
a
higher
value
on
her
;
if
,
instead
of
accepting
his
lot
in
life
as
an
inheritance
of
course
,
he
had
studied
the
right
way
to
its
appreciation
and
enhancement
.
 
<EOS>
And
still
,
for
all
this
,
and
though
there
is
a
sharp
heartache
in
all
this
,
the
vanity
and
caprice
of
youth
sustain
that
handsome
figure
of
Miss
Landless
in
the
background
of
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
That
was
a
curious
look
of
Rosa
's
when
they
parted
at
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Did
it
mean
that
she
saw
below
the
surface
of
his
thoughts
,
and
down
into
their
twilight
depths
?
 
<EOS>
Scarcely
that
,
for
it
was
a
look
of
astonished
and
keen
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
He
decides
that
he
can
not
understand
it
,
though
it
was
remarkably
expressive
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
only
waits
for
Mr
Grewgious
now
,
and
will
depart
immediately
after
having
seen
him
,
he
takes
a
sauntering
leave
of
the
ancient
city
and
its
neighbourhood
.
 
<EOS>
He
recalls
the
time
when
Rosa
and
he
walked
here
or
there
,
mere
children
,
full
of
the
dignity
of
being
engaged
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
children
!
<EOS>
he
thinks
,
with
a
pitying
sadness
.
   
<EOS>
Finding
that
his
watch
has
stopped
,
he
turns
into
the
jeweller
's
shop
,
to
have
it
wound
and
set
.
 
<EOS>
The
jeweller
is
knowing
on
the
subject
of
a
bracelet
,
which
he
begs
leave
to
submit
,
in
a
general
and
quite
aimless
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
suit
(
he
considers
)
<EOS>
a
young
bride
,
to
perfection
;
especially
if
of
a
rather
diminutive
style
of
beauty
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
the
bracelet
but
coldly
looked
at
,
the
jeweller
invites
attention
to
a
tray
of
rings
for
gentlemen
;
here
is
a
style
of
ring
,
now
,
he
remarks
---
a
very
chaste
signet
---
which
gentlemen
are
much
given
to
purchasing
,
when
changing
their
condition
.
 
<EOS>
A
ring
of
a
very
responsible
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
date
of
their
wedding
-
day
engraved
inside
,
several
gentlemen
have
preferred
it
to
any
other
kind
of
memento
.
   
<EOS>
The
rings
are
as
coldly
viewed
as
the
bracelet
.
 
<EOS>
Edwin
tells
the
tempter
that
he
wears
no
jewellery
but
his
watch
and
chain
,
which
were
his
father
's
;
and
his
shirt
-
pin
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
I
was
aware
of
,
"
is
the
jeweller
's
reply
,
"
for
Mr
Jasper
dropped
in
for
a
watch
-
glass
the
other
day
,
and
,
in
fact
,
I
showed
these
articles
to
him
,
remarking
that
if
he
SHOULD
wish
to
make
a
present
to
a
gentleman
relative
,
on
any
particular
occasion
---
But
he
said
with
a
smile
that
he
had
an
inventory
in
his
mind
of
all
the
jewellery
his
gentleman
relative
ever
wore
;
namely
,
his
watch
and
chain
,
and
his
shirt
-
pin
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Still
(
the
jeweller
considers
)
<EOS>
that
might
not
apply
to
all
times
,
though
applying
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twenty
minutes
past
two
,
Mr
Drood
,
I
set
your
watch
at
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
recommend
you
not
to
let
it
run
down
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
Edwin
takes
his
watch
,
puts
it
on
,
and
goes
out
,
thinking
:
 
"
<EOS>
Dear
old
Jack
!
 
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
make
an
extra
crease
in
my
neckcloth
,
he
would
think
it
worth
noticing
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
strolls
about
and
about
,
to
pass
the
time
until
the
dinner
-
hour
.
<EOS>
It
somehow
happens
that
Cloisterham
seems
reproachful
to
him
to
-
day
;
has
fault
to
find
with
him
,
as
if
he
had
not
used
it
well
;
but
is
far
more
pensive
with
him
than
angry
.
 
<EOS>
His
wonted
carelessness
is
replaced
by
a
wistful
looking
at
,
and
dwelling
upon
,
all
the
old
landmarks
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
soon
be
far
away
,
and
may
never
see
them
again
,
he
thinks
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
youth
!
 
<EOS>
Poor
youth
!
   
<EOS>
As
dusk
draws
on
,
he
paces
the
Monks
'
Vineyard
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
walked
to
and
fro
,
full
half
an
hour
by
the
Cathedral
chimes
,
and
it
has
closed
in
dark
,
before
he
becomes
quite
aware
of
a
woman
crouching
on
the
ground
near
a
wicket
gate
in
a
corner
.
 
<EOS>
The
gate
commands
a
cross
bye
-
path
,
little
used
in
the
gloaming
;
and
the
figure
must
have
been
there
all
the
time
,
though
he
has
but
gradually
and
lately
made
it
out
.
   
<EOS>
He
strikes
into
that
path
,
and
walks
up
to
the
wicket
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
a
lamp
near
it
,
he
sees
that
the
woman
is
of
a
haggard
appearance
,
and
that
her
weazen
chin
is
resting
on
her
hands
,
and
that
her
eyes
are
staring
---
with
an
unwinking
,
blind
sort
of
steadfastness
---
before
her
.
   
<EOS>
Always
kindly
,
but
moved
to
be
unusually
kind
this
evening
,
and
having
bestowed
kind
words
on
most
of
the
children
and
aged
people
he
has
met
,
he
at
once
bends
down
,
and
speaks
to
this
woman
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ill
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
deary
,
"
she
answers
,
without
looking
at
him
,
and
with
no
departure
from
her
strange
blind
stare
.
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
blind
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
lost
,
homeless
,
faint
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
,
that
you
stay
here
in
the
cold
so
long
,
without
moving
?
"
   
<EOS>
By
slow
and
stiff
efforts
,
she
appears
to
contract
her
vision
until
it
can
rest
upon
him
;
and
then
a
curious
film
passes
over
her
,
and
she
begins
to
shake
.
   
<EOS>
He
straightens
himself
,
recoils
a
step
,
and
looks
down
at
her
in
a
dread
amazement
;
for
he
seems
to
know
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
he
thinks
,
next
moment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Like
Jack
that
night
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
he
looks
down
at
her
,
she
looks
up
at
him
,
and
whimpers
:
 
<EOS>
"
My
lungs
is
weakly
;
my
lungs
is
dreffle
bad
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
me
,
poor
me
,
my
cough
is
rattling
dry
!
"
and
coughs
in
confirmation
horribly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
come
from
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
from
London
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
(
Her
cough
still
rending
her
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Back
to
London
,
<EOS>
deary
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
here
,
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
,
and
I
ai
n't
found
it
.
 
<EOS>
Look'ee
,
deary
;
give
me
three
-
and
-
sixpence
,
and
do
n't
you
be
afeard
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
get
back
to
London
then
,
and
trouble
no
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
in
a
business
.
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
Ah
,
me
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
slack
,
it
's
slack
,
and
times
is
very
bad
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
but
I
can
make
a
shift
to
live
by
it
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
eat
opium
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Smokes
it
,
"
she
replies
with
difficulty
,
still
racked
by
her
cough
.
 
<EOS>
"
Give
me
three
-
and
-
sixpence
,
and
I
'll
lay
it
out
well
,
and
get
back
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
do
n't
give
me
three
-
and
-
sixpence
,
do
n't
give
me
a
brass
farden
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
give
me
three
-
and
-
sixpence
,
deary
,
I
'll
tell
you
something
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
counts
the
money
from
his
pocket
,
and
puts
it
in
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
instantly
clutches
it
tight
,
and
rises
to
her
feet
with
a
croaking
laugh
of
satisfaction
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
ye
!
 
<EOS>
Hark'ee
,
dear
genl'mn
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
your
Chris'en
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edwin
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Edwin
,
Edwin
,
Edwin
,
"
she
repeats
,
trailing
off
into
a
drowsy
repetition
of
the
word
;
and
then
asks
suddenly
:
 
<EOS>
"
Is
the
short
of
that
name
Eddy
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
sometimes
called
so
,
"
he
replies
,
with
the
colour
starting
to
his
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
sweethearts
call
it
so
?
<EOS>
"
she
asks
,
pondering
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
know
?
"
   
"
Have
n't
you
a
sweetheart
,
upon
your
soul
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
None
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
is
moving
away
,
with
another
"
Bless
ye
,
and
thank'ee
,
deary
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
when
he
adds
:
 
"
You
were
to
tell
me
something
;
you
may
as
well
do
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
was
,
so
<EOS>
I
was
.
 
<EOS>
Well
,
then
.
 
<EOS>
Whisper
.
 
<EOS>
You
be
thankful
that
your
name
ai
n't
Ned
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
looks
at
her
quite
steadily
,
as
he
asks
:
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
it
's
a
bad
name
to
have
just
now
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
a
bad
name
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
threatened
name
.
 
<EOS>
A
dangerous
name
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
proverb
says
that
threatened
men
live
long
,
"
he
tells
her
,
lightly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
Ned
<EOS>
---
so
threatened
is
he
,
wherever
he
may
be
while
I
am
a
-
talking
to
you
,
deary
---
should
live
to
all
eternity
!
"
replies
the
woman
.
   
<EOS>
She
has
leaned
forward
to
say
it
in
his
ear
,
with
her
forefinger
shaking
before
his
eyes
,
and
now
huddles
herself
together
,
and
with
another
"
Bless
ye
,
and
thank'ee
!
<EOS>
"
goes
away
in
the
direction
of
the
Travellers
'
Lodging
House
.
   
<EOS>
This
is
not
an
inspiriting
close
to
a
dull
day
.
 
<EOS>
Alone
,
in
a
sequestered
place
,
surrounded
by
vestiges
of
old
time
and
decay
,
it
rather
has
a
tendency
to
call
a
shudder
into
being
.
 
<EOS>
He
makes
for
the
better
-
lighted
streets
,
and
resolves
as
he
walks
on
to
say
nothing
of
this
to
-
night
,
but
to
mention
it
to
Jack
(
who
alone
calls
him
Ned
)
,
as
an
odd
coincidence
,
to
-
morrow
;
of
course
only
as
a
coincidence
,
and
not
as
anything
better
worth
remembering
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
it
holds
to
him
,
as
many
things
much
better
worth
remembering
never
did
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
another
mile
or
so
,
to
linger
out
before
the
dinner
-
hour
;
and
,
when
he
walks
over
the
bridge
and
by
the
river
,
the
woman
's
words
are
in
the
rising
wind
,
in
the
angry
sky
,
in
the
troubled
water
,
in
the
flickering
lights
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
some
solemn
echo
of
them
even
in
the
Cathedral
chime
,
which
strikes
a
sudden
surprise
to
his
heart
as
he
turns
in
under
the
archway
of
the
gatehouse
.
   
<EOS>
And
so
HE
goes
up
the
postern
stair
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
passes
a
more
agreeable
and
cheerful
day
than
either
of
his
guests
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
music
-
lessons
to
give
in
the
holiday
season
,
his
time
is
his
own
,
but
for
the
Cathedral
services
.
 
<EOS>
He
is
early
among
the
shopkeepers
,
ordering
little
table
luxuries
that
his
nephew
likes
.
 
<EOS>
His
nephew
will
not
be
with
him
long
,
he
tells
his
provision
-
dealers
,
and
so
must
be
petted
and
made
much
of
.
 
<EOS>
While
out
on
his
hospitable
preparations
,
he
looks
in
on
Mr
Sapsea
;
and
mentions
that
dear
Ned
,
and
that
inflammable
young
spark
of
Mr
Crisparkle
's
,
are
to
dine
at
the
gatehouse
to
-
day
,
and
make
up
their
difference
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
is
by
no
means
friendly
towards
the
inflammable
young
spark
.
 
<EOS>
He
says
that
his
complexion
is
"
Un
-
English
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
when
Mr
Sapsea
has
once
declared
anything
to
be
Un
-
English
,
he
considers
that
thing
everlastingly
sunk
in
the
bottomless
pit
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
is
truly
sorry
to
hear
Mr
Sapsea
speak
thus
,
for
he
knows
right
well
that
Mr
Sapsea
never
speaks
without
a
meaning
,
and
that
he
has
a
subtle
trick
of
being
right
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
(
by
a
very
remarkable
coincidence
)
is
of
exactly
that
opinion
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
is
in
beautiful
voice
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
pathetic
supplication
to
have
his
heart
inclined
to
keep
this
law
,
he
quite
astonishes
his
fellows
by
his
melodious
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
never
sung
difficult
music
with
such
skill
and
harmony
,
as
in
this
day
's
Anthem
.
 
<EOS>
His
nervous
temperament
is
occasionally
prone
to
take
difficult
music
a
little
too
quickly
;
to
-
day
,
his
time
is
perfect
.
   
<EOS>
These
results
are
probably
attained
through
a
grand
composure
of
the
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
The
mere
mechanism
of
his
throat
is
a
little
tender
,
for
he
wears
,
both
with
his
singing
-
robe
and
with
his
ordinary
dress
,
a
large
black
scarf
of
strong
close
-
woven
silk
,
slung
loosely
round
his
neck
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
composure
is
so
noticeable
,
that
Mr
Crisparkle
speaks
of
it
as
they
come
out
from
Vespers
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
must
thank
you
,
Jasper
,
for
the
pleasure
with
which
I
have
heard
you
to
-
day
.
 
<EOS>
Beautiful
!
 
<EOS>
Delightful
!
 
<EOS>
You
could
not
have
so
outdone
yourself
,
I
hope
,
without
being
wonderfully
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
AM
wonderfully
well
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Nothing
unequal
,
"
says
the
Minor
Canon
,
with
a
smooth
motion
of
his
hand
:
 
<EOS>
"
nothing
unsteady
,
nothing
forced
,
nothing
avoided
;
all
thoroughly
done
in
a
masterly
manner
,
with
perfect
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
so
,
if
it
is
not
too
much
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
One
would
think
,
Jasper
,
you
had
been
trying
a
new
medicine
for
that
occasional
indisposition
of
yours
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
really
?
 
<EOS>
That
's
well
observed
;
for
I
have
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
stick
to
it
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
says
Mr
Crisparkle
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
with
friendly
encouragement
,
"
stick
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
congratulate
you
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
pursues
,
as
they
come
out
of
the
Cathedral
,
"
on
all
accounts
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
walk
round
to
the
Corner
with
you
,
if
you
do
n't
object
;
I
have
plenty
of
time
before
my
company
come
;
and
I
want
to
say
a
word
to
you
,
which
I
think
you
will
not
be
displeased
to
hear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
speaking
,
the
other
evening
,
of
my
black
humours
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
's
face
falls
,
and
he
shakes
his
head
deploringly
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
you
know
,
that
I
should
make
you
an
antidote
to
those
black
humours
;
and
you
said
you
hoped
I
would
consign
them
to
the
flames
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
still
hope
so
,
Jasper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
With
the
best
reason
in
the
world
!
 
<EOS>
I
mean
to
burn
this
year
's
Diary
at
the
year
's
end
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
you
---
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
brightens
greatly
as
he
thus
begins
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
anticipate
me
.
 
<EOS>
Because
I
feel
that
I
have
been
out
of
sorts
,
gloomy
,
bilious
,
brain
-
oppressed
,
whatever
it
may
be
.
 
<EOS>
You
said
I
had
been
exaggerative
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
have
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
's
brightened
face
brightens
still
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
see
it
then
,
because
I
WAS
out
of
sorts
;
but
I
am
in
a
healthier
state
now
,
and
I
acknowledge
it
with
genuine
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
a
great
deal
of
a
very
little
;
that
's
the
fact
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
me
good
,
"
cries
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
to
hear
you
say
it
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
leading
a
monotonous
life
,
"
Jasper
proceeds
,
"
and
getting
his
nerves
,
or
his
stomach
,
out
of
order
,
dwells
upon
an
idea
until
it
loses
its
proportions
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
my
case
with
the
idea
in
question
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
shall
burn
the
evidence
of
my
case
,
when
the
book
is
full
,
and
begin
the
next
volume
with
a
clearer
vision
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
better
,
"
says
Mr
Crisparkle
,
stopping
at
the
steps
of
his
own
door
to
shake
hands
,
"
than
I
could
have
hoped
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
naturally
,
"
returns
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
had
but
<EOS>
little
reason
to
hope
that
I
should
become
more
like
yourself
.
 
<EOS>
You
are
always
training
yourself
to
be
,
mind
and
body
,
as
clear
as
crystal
,
and
you
always
are
,
and
never
change
;
whereas
I
am
a
muddy
,
solitary
,
moping
weed
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
I
have
got
over
that
mope
.
 
<EOS>
Shall
I
wait
,
while
you
ask
if
Mr
Neville
has
left
for
my
place
?
 
<EOS>
If
not
,
he
and
I
may
walk
round
together
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
,
"
says
Mr
Crisparkle
,
opening
the
entrance
-
door
with
his
key
,
"
that
he
left
some
time
ago
;
at
least
I
know
he
left
,
and
I
think
he
has
not
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
'll
inquire
.
 
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
come
in
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
company
wait
,
"
said
Jasper
,
with
a
smile
.
   
<EOS>
The
Minor
Canon
disappears
,
and
in
a
few
moments
returns
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
thought
,
Mr
Neville
has
not
come
back
;
indeed
,
as
he
remembers
now
,
Mr
Neville
said
he
would
probably
go
straight
to
the
gatehouse
.
   
<EOS>
"
Bad
manners
in
a
host
!
"
says
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
company
will
be
there
before
me
!
 
<EOS>
What
will
you
bet
that
I
do
n't
find
my
company
embracing
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
bet
---
or
I
would
,
if
ever
I
did
bet
,
"
returns
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
that
your
company
will
have
a
gay
entertainer
this
evening
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
nods
,
and
laughs
good
-
night
!
   
<EOS>
He
retraces
his
steps
to
the
Cathedral
door
,
and
turns
down
past
it
to
the
gatehouse
.
 
<EOS>
He
sings
,
in
a
low
voice
and
with
delicate
expression
,
as
he
walks
along
.
 
<EOS>
It
still
seems
as
if
a
false
note
were
not
within
his
power
to
-
night
,
and
as
if
nothing
could
hurry
or
retard
him
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
thus
under
the
arched
entrance
of
his
dwelling
,
he
pauses
for
an
instant
in
the
shelter
to
pull
off
that
great
black
scarf
,
and
bang
it
in
a
loop
upon
his
arm
.
 
<EOS>
For
that
brief
time
,
his
face
is
knitted
and
stern
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
immediately
clears
,
as
he
resumes
his
singing
,
and
his
way
.
   
<EOS>
And
so
HE
goes
up
the
postern
stair
.
   
<EOS>
The
red
light
burns
steadily
all
the
evening
in
the
lighthouse
on
the
margin
of
the
tide
of
busy
life
.
 
<EOS>
Softened
sounds
and
hum
of
traffic
pass
it
and
flow
on
irregularly
into
the
lonely
Precincts
;
but
very
little
else
goes
by
,
save
violent
rushes
of
wind
.
 
<EOS>
It
comes
on
to
blow
a
boisterous
gale
.
   
<EOS>
The
Precincts
are
never
particularly
well
lighted
;
but
the
strong
blasts
of
wind
blowing
out
many
of
the
lamps
(
in
some
instances
shattering
the
frames
too
,
and
bringing
the
glass
rattling
to
the
ground
)
,
they
are
unusually
dark
to
-
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
darkness
is
augmented
and
confused
,
by
flying
dust
from
the
earth
,
dry
twigs
from
the
trees
,
and
great
ragged
fragments
from
the
rooks
'
nests
up
in
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
The
trees
themselves
<EOS>
so
toss
and
creak
,
as
this
tangible
part
of
the
darkness
madly
whirls
about
,
that
they
seem
in
peril
of
being
torn
out
of
the
earth
:
 
while
ever
and
again
a
crack
,
and
a
rushing
fall
,
denote
that
some
large
branch
has
yielded
to
the
storm
.
   
<EOS>
Not
such
power
of
wind
has
blown
for
many
a
winter
night
.
 
<EOS>
Chimneys
topple
in
the
streets
,
and
people
hold
to
posts
and
corners
,
and
to
one
another
,
to
keep
themselves
upon
their
feet
.
 
<EOS>
The
violent
rushes
abate
not
,
but
increase
in
frequency
and
fury
until
at
midnight
,
when
the
streets
are
empty
,
the
storm
goes
thundering
along
them
,
rattling
at
all
the
latches
,
and
tearing
at
all
the
shutters
,
as
if
warning
the
people
to
get
up
and
fly
with
it
,
rather
than
have
the
roofs
brought
down
upon
their
brains
.
   
<EOS>
Still
,
the
red
light
burns
steadily
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
is
steady
but
the
red
light
.
   
<EOS>
All
through
the
night
the
wind
blows
,
and
abates
not
.
 
<EOS>
But
early
in
the
morning
,
when
there
is
barely
enough
light
in
the
east
to
dim
the
stars
,
it
begins
to
lull
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
with
occasional
wild
charges
,
like
a
wounded
monster
dying
,
it
drops
and
sinks
;
and
at
full
daylight
it
is
dead
.
   
<EOS>
It
is
then
seen
that
the
hands
of
the
Cathedral
clock
are
torn
off
;
that
lead
from
the
roof
has
been
stripped
away
,
rolled
up
,
and
blown
into
the
Close
;
and
that
some
stones
have
been
displaced
upon
the
summit
of
the
great
tower
.
 
<EOS>
Christmas
morning
though
it
be
,
it
is
necessary
to
send
up
workmen
,
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
damage
done
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
led
by
Durdles
,
go
aloft
;
while
Mr
Tope
and
a
crowd
of
early
idlers
gather
down
in
Minor
Canon
Corner
,
shading
their
eyes
and
watching
for
their
appearance
up
there
.
   
<EOS>
This
cluster
is
suddenly
broken
and
put
aside
by
the
hands
of
Mr
Jasper
;
all
the
gazing
eyes
are
brought
down
to
the
earth
by
his
loudly
inquiring
of
Mr
Crisparkle
,
at
an
open
window
:
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
nephew
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
been
here
.
 
<EOS>
Is
he
not
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
down
to
the
river
last
night
,
with
Mr
Neville
,
to
look
at
the
storm
,
and
has
not
been
back
.
 
<EOS>
Call
Mr
Neville
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
left
this
morning
,
early
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Left
this
morning
early
?
 
<EOS>
Let
me
in
!
<EOS>
let
me
in
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
more
looking
up
at
the
tower
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
assembled
eyes
are
turned
on
Mr
Jasper
,
white
,
half
-
dressed
,
panting
,
and
clinging
to
the
rail
before
the
Minor
Canon
's
house
.

Chapter
15
.
<EOS>
Impeached
 
Neville
Landless
had
started
so
early
and
walked
at
so
good
a
pace
,
that
when
the
church
-
bells
began
to
ring
in
Cloisterham
for
morning
service
,
he
was
eight
miles
away
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
wanted
his
breakfast
by
that
time
,
having
set
forth
on
a
crust
of
bread
,
he
stopped
at
the
next
roadside
tavern
to
refresh
.
   
<EOS>
Visitors
in
want
of
breakfast
---
unless
they
were
horses
or
cattle
,
for
which
class
of
guests
<EOS>
there
was
preparation
enough
in
the
way
of
water
-
trough
and
hay
<EOS>
---
were
so
unusual
at
the
sign
of
The
Tilted
Wagon
,
that
it
took
a
long
time
to
get
the
wagon
into
the
track
of
tea
and
toast
and
bacon
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
in
the
interval
,
sitting
in
a
sanded
parlour
,
wondering
in
how
long
a
time
after
he
had
gone
,
the
sneezy
fire
of
damp
fagots
would
begin
to
make
somebody
else
warm
.
   
<EOS>
Indeed
,
The
Tilted
Wagon
,
as
a
cool
establishment
on
the
top
of
a
hill
,
where
the
ground
before
the
door
was
puddled
with
damp
hoofs
and
trodden
straw
;
where
a
scolding
landlady
slapped
a
moist
baby
(
with
one
red
sock
on
and
one
wanting
)
,
in
the
bar
;
where
the
cheese
was
cast
aground
upon
a
shelf
,
in
company
with
a
mouldy
tablecloth
and
a
green
-
handled
knife
,
in
a
sort
of
cast
-
iron
canoe
;
where
the
pale
-
faced
bread
shed
tears
of
crumb
over
its
shipwreck
in
another
canoe
;
where
the
family
linen
,
half
washed
and
half
dried
,
led
a
public
life
of
lying
about
;
where
everything
to
drink
was
drunk
out
of
mugs
,
and
everything
else
was
suggestive
of
a
rhyme
to
mugs
;
The
Tilted
Wagon
,
all
these
things
considered
,
hardly
kept
its
painted
promise
of
providing
good
entertainment
for
Man
and
Beast
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
Man
,
in
the
present
case
,
was
not
critical
,
but
took
what
entertainment
he
could
get
,
and
went
on
again
after
a
longer
rest
than
he
needed
.
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
at
some
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
house
,
hesitating
whether
to
pursue
the
road
,
or
to
follow
a
cart
track
between
two
high
hedgerows
,
which
led
across
the
slope
of
a
breezy
heath
,
and
evidently
struck
into
the
road
again
by
-
and
-
by
.
 
<EOS>
He
decided
in
favour
of
this
latter
track
,
and
pursued
it
with
some
toil
;
the
rise
being
steep
,
and
the
way
worn
into
deep
ruts
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
labouring
along
,
when
he
became
aware
of
some
other
pedestrians
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
were
coming
up
at
a
faster
pace
than
his
,
he
stood
aside
,
against
one
of
the
high
banks
,
to
let
them
pass
.
 
<EOS>
But
their
manner
was
very
curious
.
 
<EOS>
Only
four
of
them
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Other
four
slackened
speed
,
and
loitered
as
intending
to
follow
him
when
he
should
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
remainder
of
the
party
(
half
-
a
-
dozen
perhaps
)
turned
,
and
went
back
at
a
great
rate
.
   
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
four
behind
him
,
and
he
looked
at
the
four
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
all
returned
his
look
.
 
<EOS>
He
resumed
his
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
four
in
advance
went
on
,
constantly
looking
back
;
the
four
in
the
rear
came
closing
up
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
all
ranged
out
from
the
narrow
track
upon
the
open
slope
of
the
heath
,
and
this
order
was
maintained
,
let
him
diverge
as
he
would
to
either
side
,
there
was
no
longer
room
to
doubt
that
he
was
beset
by
these
fellows
.
 
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
as
a
last
test
;
and
they
all
stopped
.
    
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
attend
upon
me
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
the
whole
body
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
a
pack
of
thieves
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
answer
him
,
"
said
one
of
the
number
;
he
did
not
see
which
.
<EOS>
"
Better
be
quiet
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Better
be
quiet
?
"
repeated
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
said
so
?
"
   
<EOS>
Nobody
replied
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
good
advice
,
whichever
of
you
skulkers
gave
it
,
"
he
went
on
angrily
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
submit
to
be
penned
in
between
four
men
there
,
and
four
men
there
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
to
pass
,
and
I
mean
to
pass
,
those
four
in
front
.
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
all
standing
still
;
himself
included
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
eight
men
,
or
four
men
,
or
two
men
,
set
upon
one
,
"
he
proceeded
,
growing
more
enraged
,
"
the
one
has
no
chance
but
to
set
his
mark
upon
some
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
by
the
Lord
,
I
'll
do
it
,
if
I
am
interrupted
any
farther
!
"
   
<EOS>
Shouldering
his
heavy
stick
,
and
quickening
his
pace
,
he
shot
on
to
pass
the
four
ahead
.
 
<EOS>
The
largest
and
strongest
man
of
the
number
changed
swiftly
to
the
side
on
which
he
came
up
,
and
dexterously
closed
with
him
and
went
down
with
him
;
but
not
before
the
heavy
stick
had
descended
smartly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
!
"
<EOS>
said
this
man
in
a
suppressed
voice
,
as
they
struggled
together
on
the
grass
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fair
play
!
 
<EOS>
His
is
the
build
of
a
girl
to
mine
,
and
he
's
got
a
weight
strapped
to
his
back
besides
.
<EOS>
Let
him
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
'll
manage
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
After
a
little
rolling
about
,
in
a
close
scuffle
which
caused
the
faces
of
both
to
be
besmeared
with
blood
,
the
man
took
his
knee
from
Neville
's
chest
,
and
rose
,
saying
:
 
"
<EOS>
There
!
 
<EOS>
Now
take
him
arm
-
in
-
arm
,
any
two
of
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
immediately
done
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
to
our
being
a
pack
of
thieves
,
Mr
Landless
,
"
said
the
man
,
as
he
spat
out
some
blood
,
and
wiped
more
from
his
face
;
"
you
know
better
than
that
at
midday
.
 
<EOS>
We
would
n't
have
touched
you
if
you
had
n't
forced
us
.
 
<EOS>
We
're
going
to
take
you
round
to
the
high
road
,
anyhow
,
and
you
'll
find
help
enough
against
thieves
there
,
if
you
want
it
.
<EOS>
---
Wipe
his
face
,
somebody
;
see
how
it
's
a
-
trickling
down
him
!
"
   
<EOS>
When
his
face
was
cleansed
,
Neville
recognised
in
the
speaker
,
Joe
,
driver
of
the
Cloisterham
omnibus
,
whom
he
had
seen
but
once
,
and
that
on
the
day
of
his
arrival
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
I
recommend
you
for
the
present
,
is
<EOS>
,
do
n't
talk
,
Mr
Landless
.
 
<EOS>
You
'll
find
a
friend
waiting
for
you
,
at
the
high
road
---
gone
ahead
by
the
other
way
when
we
split
into
two
parties
---
and
you
had
much
better
say
nothing
till
you
come
up
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
that
stick
along
,
somebody
else
,
and
let
's
be
moving
!
"
   
<EOS>
Utterly
bewildered
,
Neville
stared
around
him
and
said
not
a
word
.
<EOS>
Walking
between
his
two
conductors
,
who
held
his
arms
in
theirs
,
he
went
on
,
as
in
a
dream
,
until
they
came
again
into
the
high
road
,
and
into
the
midst
of
a
little
group
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
who
had
turned
back
were
among
the
group
;
and
its
central
figures
were
Mr
Jasper
and
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
's
conductors
took
him
up
to
the
Minor
Canon
,
and
there
released
him
,
as
an
act
of
deference
to
that
gentleman
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
all
this
,
sir
?
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
I
feel
as
if
I
had
lost
my
senses
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Neville
,
the
group
closing
in
around
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
my
nephew
?
"
asked
Mr
Jasper
,
wildly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Where
is
your
nephew
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Neville
,
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you
ask
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
"
retorted
Jasper
,
"
because
you
were
the
last
person
in
his
company
,
and
he
is
not
to
be
found
.
"
   
"
Not
to
be
found
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Neville
,
aghast
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
stay
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Permit
me
,
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Neville
,
you
are
confounded
;
collect
your
thoughts
;
it
is
of
great
importance
that
you
should
collect
your
thoughts
;
attend
to
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
,
sir
,
but
I
seem
mad
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
left
Mr
Jasper
last
night
with
Edwin
Drood
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
At
what
hour
?
"
   
"
Was
it
at
twelve
o'clock
?
"
asked
Neville
,
with
his
hand
to
his
confused
head
,
and
appealing
to
Jasper
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
right
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
;
<EOS>
"
the
hour
Mr
Jasper
has
already
named
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
went
down
to
the
river
together
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
Undoubtedly
.
 
<EOS>
To
see
the
action
of
the
wind
there
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
followed
?
 
<EOS>
How
long
did
you
stay
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
About
ten
minutes
;
I
should
say
not
more
.
 
<EOS>
We
then
walked
together
to
your
house
,
and
he
took
leave
of
me
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Did
he
say
that
he
was
going
down
to
the
river
again
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
he
was
going
straight
back
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
bystanders
looked
at
one
another
,
and
at
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
Mr
Jasper
,
who
had
been
intensely
watching
Neville
,
said
,
in
a
low
,
distinct
,
suspicious
voice
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
are
those
stains
upon
his
dress
?
"
   
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
blood
upon
his
clothes
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
here
are
the
same
stains
upon
this
stick
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jasper
,
taking
it
from
the
hand
of
the
man
who
held
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
know
the
stick
to
be
his
,
and
he
carried
it
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
this
mean
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
name
of
God
,
say
what
it
means
,
Neville
!
"
urged
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
man
and
I
,
"
said
Neville
,
pointing
out
his
late
adversary
,
"
had
a
struggle
for
the
stick
just
now
,
and
you
may
see
the
same
marks
on
him
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
What
was
I
to
suppose
,
when
I
found
myself
molested
by
eight
people
?
 
<EOS>
Could
I
dream
of
the
true
reason
when
they
would
give
me
none
at
all
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
admitted
that
they
had
thought
it
discreet
to
be
silent
,
and
that
the
struggle
had
taken
place
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
the
very
men
who
had
seen
it
looked
darkly
at
the
smears
which
the
bright
cold
air
had
already
dried
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
return
,
Neville
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
;
"
of
course
you
will
be
glad
to
come
back
to
clear
yourself
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Landless
will
walk
at
my
side
,
"
the
Minor
Canon
continued
,
looking
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Neville
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
set
forth
on
the
walk
back
;
and
the
others
,
with
one
exception
,
straggled
after
them
at
various
distances
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
walked
on
the
other
side
of
Neville
,
and
never
quitted
that
position
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
silent
,
while
Mr
Crisparkle
more
than
once
repeated
his
former
questions
,
and
while
Neville
repeated
his
former
answers
;
also
,
while
they
both
hazarded
some
explanatory
conjectures
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
obstinately
silent
,
because
Mr
Crisparkle
's
manner
directly
appealed
to
him
to
take
some
part
in
the
discussion
,
and
no
appeal
would
move
his
fixed
face
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
drew
near
to
the
city
,
and
it
was
suggested
by
the
Minor
Canon
that
they
might
do
well
in
calling
on
the
Mayor
at
once
,
he
assented
with
a
stern
nod
;
but
he
spake
no
word
until
they
stood
in
Mr
Sapsea
's
parlour
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
being
informed
by
Mr
Crisparkle
of
the
circumstances
under
which
they
desired
to
make
a
voluntary
statement
before
him
,
Mr
Jasper
broke
silence
by
declaring
that
he
placed
his
whole
reliance
,
humanly
speaking
,
on
Mr
Sapsea
's
penetration
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
conceivable
reason
why
his
nephew
should
have
suddenly
absconded
,
unless
Mr
Sapsea
could
suggest
one
,
and
then
he
would
defer
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
intelligible
likelihood
of
his
having
returned
to
the
river
,
and
been
accidentally
drowned
in
the
dark
,
unless
it
should
appear
likely
to
Mr
Sapsea
,
and
then
again
he
would
defer
.
<EOS>
He
washed
his
hands
as
clean
as
he
could
of
all
horrible
suspicions
,
unless
it
should
appear
to
Mr
Sapsea
that
some
such
were
inseparable
from
his
last
companion
before
his
disappearance
(
not
on
good
terms
with
previously
)
,
and
then
,
once
more
,
he
would
defer
.
 
<EOS>
His
own
state
of
mind
,
he
being
distracted
with
doubts
,
and
labouring
under
dismal
apprehensions
,
was
not
to
be
safely
trusted
;
but
Mr
Sapsea
's
was
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
case
had
a
dark
look
;
in
short
(
and
here
his
eyes
rested
full
on
Neville
's
countenance
)
,
an
Un
-
English
complexion
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
this
grand
point
,
he
wandered
into
a
denser
haze
and
maze
of
nonsense
than
even
a
mayor
might
have
been
expected
to
disport
himself
in
,
and
came
out
of
it
with
the
brilliant
discovery
that
to
take
the
life
of
a
fellow
-
creature
<EOS>
was
to
take
something
that
did
n't
belong
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
He
wavered
whether
or
no
he
should
at
once
issue
his
warrant
for
the
committal
of
Neville
Landless
to
jail
,
under
circumstances
of
grave
suspicion
;
and
he
might
have
gone
so
far
as
to
do
it
but
for
the
indignant
protest
of
the
Minor
Canon
:
 
who
undertook
for
the
young
man
's
remaining
in
his
own
house
,
and
being
produced
by
his
own
hands
,
whenever
demanded
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
then
understood
Mr
Sapsea
to
suggest
that
the
river
should
be
dragged
,
that
its
banks
should
be
rigidly
examined
,
that
particulars
of
the
disappearance
should
be
sent
to
all
outlying
places
and
to
London
,
and
that
placards
and
advertisements
should
be
widely
circulated
imploring
Edwin
Drood
,
if
for
any
unknown
reason
he
had
withdrawn
himself
from
his
uncle
's
home
and
society
,
to
take
pity
on
that
loving
kinsman
's
sore
bereavement
and
distress
,
and
somehow
inform
him
that
he
was
yet
alive
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Sapsea
was
perfectly
understood
,
for
this
was
exactly
his
meaning
<EOS>
(
though
he
had
said
nothing
about
it
)
;
and
measures
were
taken
towards
all
these
ends
immediately
.
   
<EOS>
It
would
be
difficult
to
determine
which
was
the
more
oppressed
with
horror
and
amazement
:
 
<EOS>
Neville
Landless
,
or
John
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
Jasper
's
position
forced
him
to
be
active
,
while
Neville
's
forced
him
to
be
passive
,
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
choose
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Each
was
bowed
down
and
broken
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
earliest
light
of
the
next
morning
,
men
were
at
work
upon
the
river
,
and
other
men
---
most
of
whom
volunteered
for
the
service
---
were
examining
the
banks
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
livelong
day
the
search
went
on
;
upon
the
river
,
with
barge
and
pole
,
and
drag
and
net
;
upon
the
muddy
and
rushy
shore
,
with
jack
-
boots
,
hatchet
,
spade
,
rope
,
dogs
,
and
all
imaginable
appliances
.
 
<EOS>
Even
at
night
,
the
river
was
specked
with
lanterns
,
and
lurid
with
fires
;
far
-
off
creeks
,
into
which
the
tide
washed
as
it
changed
,
had
their
knots
of
watchers
,
listening
to
the
lapping
of
the
stream
,
and
looking
out
for
any
burden
it
might
bear
;
remote
shingly
causeways
near
the
sea
,
and
lonely
points
off
which
there
was
a
race
of
water
,
had
their
unwonted
flaring
cressets
and
rough
-
coated
figures
when
the
next
day
dawned
;
but
no
trace
of
Edwin
Drood
revisited
the
light
of
the
sun
.
   
<EOS>
All
that
day
,
again
,
the
search
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
in
barge
and
boat
;
and
now
ashore
among
the
osiers
,
or
tramping
amidst
mud
and
stakes
and
jagged
stones
in
low
-
lying
places
,
where
solitary
watermarks
and
signals
of
strange
shapes
showed
like
spectres
,
John
Jasper
worked
and
toiled
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
no
purpose
;
for
still
no
trace
of
Edwin
Drood
revisited
the
light
of
the
sun
.
   
<EOS>
Setting
his
watches
for
that
night
again
,
so
that
vigilant
eyes
should
be
kept
on
every
change
of
tide
,
he
went
home
exhausted
.
<EOS>
Unkempt
and
disordered
,
bedaubed
with
mud
that
had
dried
upon
him
,
and
with
much
of
his
clothing
torn
to
rags
,
he
had
but
just
dropped
into
his
easy
-
chair
,
when
Mr
Grewgious
stood
before
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
is
strange
news
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
"
Strange
and
fearful
news
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
had
merely
lifted
up
his
heavy
eyes
to
say
it
,
and
now
dropped
them
again
as
he
drooped
,
worn
out
,
over
one
side
of
his
easy
-
chair
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
smoothed
his
head
and
face
,
and
stood
looking
at
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
is
your
ward
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jasper
,
after
a
time
,
in
a
faint
,
fatigued
voice
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
little
thing
!
 
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
her
condition
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
his
sister
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Jasper
,
as
before
.
   
<EOS>
"
Whose
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
curtness
of
the
counter
-
question
,
and
the
cool
,
slow
manner
in
which
,
as
he
put
it
,
Mr
Grewgious
moved
his
eyes
from
the
fire
to
his
companion
's
face
,
might
at
any
other
time
have
been
exasperating
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
depression
and
exhaustion
,
Jasper
merely
opened
his
eyes
to
say
:
 
"
The
suspected
young
man
's
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suspect
him
?
"
asked
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
to
think
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
make
up
my
mind
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
I
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
as
you
spoke
of
him
as
the
suspected
young
man
,
I
thought
you
HAD
made
up
your
mind
.
<EOS>
---
I
have
just
left
Miss
Landless
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
her
state
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Defiance
of
all
suspicion
,
and
unbounded
faith
in
her
brother
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
pursued
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
it
is
not
of
her
that
I
came
to
speak
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
of
my
ward
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
communication
to
make
that
will
surprise
you
.
 
<EOS>
At
least
,
it
has
surprised
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Jasper
,
with
a
groaning
sigh
,
turned
wearily
in
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
put
it
off
till
to
-
morrow
?
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
I
warn
you
,
that
I
think
it
will
surprise
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
More
attention
and
concentration
came
into
John
Jasper
's
eyes
as
they
caught
sight
of
Mr
Grewgious
smoothing
his
head
again
,
and
again
looking
at
the
fire
;
but
now
,
with
a
compressed
and
determined
mouth
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Jasper
,
becoming
upright
in
his
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
provokingly
slowly
and
internally
,
as
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
fire
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
might
have
known
it
sooner
;
she
gave
me
the
opening
;
but
I
am
such
an
exceedingly
Angular
man
,
that
it
never
occurred
to
me
<EOS>
;
I
took
all
for
granted
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Jasper
once
more
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
alternately
opening
and
shutting
the
palms
of
his
hands
as
he
warmed
them
at
the
fire
,
and
looking
fixedly
at
him
sideways
,
and
never
changing
either
his
action
or
his
look
in
all
that
followed
,
went
on
to
reply
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
young
couple
,
the
lost
youth
and
Miss
Rosa
,
my
ward
,
though
so
long
betrothed
,
and
so
long
recognising
their
betrothal
,
and
so
near
being
married
<EOS>
---
"
   
Mr
Grewgious
saw
a
staring
white
face
,
and
two
quivering
white
lips
,
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
saw
two
muddy
hands
gripping
its
sides
.
 
<EOS>
But
for
the
hands
,
he
might
have
thought
he
had
never
seen
the
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
---
This
young
couple
came
gradually
to
the
discovery
(
made
on
both
sides
pretty
equally
,
I
think
)
,
that
they
would
be
happier
and
better
,
both
in
their
present
and
their
future
lives
,
as
affectionate
friends
,
or
say
rather
as
brother
and
sister
,
than
as
husband
and
wife
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
saw
a
lead
-
coloured
face
in
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
on
its
surface
dreadful
starting
drops
or
bubbles
,
as
if
of
steel
.
   
<EOS>
"
This
young
couple
formed
at
length
the
healthy
resolution
of
interchanging
their
discoveries
,
openly
,
sensibly
,
and
tenderly
.
<EOS>
They
met
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
innocent
and
generous
talk
,
they
agreed
to
dissolve
their
existing
,
and
their
intended
,
relations
,
for
ever
and
ever
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
saw
a
ghastly
figure
rise
,
open
-
mouthed
,
from
the
easy
-
chair
,
and
lift
its
outspread
hands
towards
its
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
One
of
this
young
couple
,
and
that
one
your
nephew
,
fearful
,
however
,
that
in
the
tenderness
of
your
affection
for
him
you
would
be
bitterly
disappointed
by
so
wide
a
departure
from
his
projected
life
,
forbore
to
tell
you
the
secret
,
for
a
few
days
,
and
left
it
to
be
disclosed
by
me
,
when
I
should
come
down
to
speak
to
you
,
and
he
would
be
gone
.
 
<EOS>
I
speak
to
you
,
and
he
is
gone
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
saw
the
ghastly
figure
throw
back
its
head
,
clutch
its
hair
with
its
hands
,
and
turn
with
a
writhing
action
from
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
now
said
all
I
have
to
say
:
 
except
that
this
young
couple
parted
,
firmly
,
though
not
without
tears
and
sorrow
,
on
the
evening
when
you
last
saw
them
together
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
heard
a
terrible
shriek
,
and
saw
no
ghastly
figure
,
sitting
or
standing
;
saw
nothing
but
a
heap
of
torn
and
miry
clothes
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
Not
changing
his
action
even
then
,
he
opened
and
shut
the
palms
of
his
hands
as
he
warmed
them
,
and
looked
down
at
it

<EOS>
Devoted
 
When
John
Jasper
recovered
from
his
fit
or
swoon
,
he
found
himself
being
tended
by
Mr
and
Mrs
Tope
,
whom
his
visitor
had
summoned
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
His
visitor
,
wooden
of
aspect
,
sat
stiffly
in
a
chair
,
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
,
watching
his
recovery
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
 
<EOS>
You
've
come
to
nicely
now
,
sir
,
"
said
the
tearful
Mrs
Tope
;
"
you
were
thoroughly
worn
out
,
and
no
wonder
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
man
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
his
usual
air
of
repeating
a
lesson
,
"
can
not
have
his
rest
broken
,
and
his
mind
cruelly
tormented
,
and
his
body
overtaxed
by
fatigue
,
without
being
thoroughly
worn
out
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
have
alarmed
you
?
"
<EOS>
Jasper
apologised
faintly
,
when
he
was
helped
into
his
easy
-
chair
.
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
I
thank
you
,
"
answered
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
too
considerate
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
I
thank
you
,
"
answered
Mr
Grewgious
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
some
wine
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Tope
,
"
and
the
jelly
that
I
had
ready
for
you
,
and
that
you
would
n't
put
your
lips
to
at
noon
,
though
I
warned
you
what
would
come
of
it
,
you
know
,
and
you
not
breakfasted
;
and
you
must
have
a
wing
of
the
roast
fowl
that
has
been
put
back
twenty
times
if
it
's
been
put
back
once
.
 
<EOS>
It
shall
all
be
on
table
in
five
minutes
,
and
this
good
gentleman
belike
will
stop
and
see
you
take
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
good
gentleman
replied
with
a
snort
,
which
might
mean
yes
,
or
no
,
or
anything
or
nothing
,
and
which
Mrs
Tope
would
have
found
highly
mystifying
,
but
that
her
attention
was
divided
by
the
service
of
the
table
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
will
take
something
with
me
?
"
said
Jasper
,
as
the
cloth
was
laid
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
get
a
morsel
down
my
throat
,
I
thank
you
,
"
answered
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
Jasper
both
ate
and
drank
almost
voraciously
.
 
<EOS>
Combined
with
the
hurry
in
his
mode
of
doing
it
,
was
an
evident
indifference
to
the
taste
of
what
he
took
,
suggesting
that
he
ate
and
drank
to
fortify
himself
against
any
other
failure
of
the
spirits
,
far
more
than
to
gratify
his
palate
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
in
the
meantime
sat
upright
,
with
no
expression
in
his
face
,
and
a
hard
kind
of
imperturbably
polite
protest
all
over
him
:
 
as
though
he
would
have
said
,
in
reply
to
some
invitation
to
discourse
;
"
I
could
n't
originate
the
faintest
approach
to
an
observation
on
any
subject
<EOS>
whatever
,
I
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
"
said
Jasper
,
when
he
had
pushed
away
his
plate
and
glass
,
and
had
sat
meditating
for
a
few
minutes
:
 
<EOS>
"
do
you
know
that
I
find
some
crumbs
of
comfort
in
the
communication
with
which
you
have
so
much
amazed
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
DO
you
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Mr
Grewgious
,
pretty
plainly
adding
the
unspoken
clause
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
,
I
thank
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
recovering
from
the
shock
of
a
piece
of
news
of
my
dear
boy
,
so
entirely
unexpected
,
and
so
destructive
of
all
the
castles
I
had
built
for
him
;
and
after
having
had
time
to
think
of
it
;
yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
glad
to
pick
up
your
crumbs
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
dryly
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
there
not
,
or
is
there
---
if
I
deceive
myself
,
tell
me
so
,
and
shorten
my
pain
---
is
there
not
,
or
is
there
,
hope
that
,
finding
himself
in
this
new
position
,
and
becoming
sensitively
alive
to
the
awkward
burden
of
explanation
,
in
this
quarter
,
and
that
,
and
the
other
,
with
which
it
would
load
him
,
he
avoided
the
awkwardness
,
and
took
to
flight
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
thing
might
be
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
pondering
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
thing
has
been
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
read
of
cases
in
which
people
,
rather
than
face
a
seven
days
'
wonder
,
and
have
to
account
for
themselves
to
the
idle
and
impertinent
,
have
taken
themselves
away
,
and
been
long
unheard
of
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
believe
such
things
have
happened
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
pondering
still
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
had
,
and
could
have
,
no
suspicion
,
"
pursued
Jasper
,
eagerly
following
the
new
track
,
"
that
the
dear
lost
boy
had
withheld
anything
from
me
---
most
of
all
,
such
a
leading
matter
as
this
<EOS>
---
what
gleam
of
light
was
there
for
me
in
the
whole
black
sky
?
 
<EOS>
When
I
supposed
that
his
intended
wife
was
here
,
and
his
marriage
close
at
hand
,
how
could
I
entertain
the
possibility
of
his
voluntarily
leaving
this
place
,
in
a
manner
that
would
be
so
unaccountable
,
capricious
,
and
cruel
?
 
<EOS>
But
now
that
I
know
what
you
have
told
me
,
is
there
no
little
chink
through
which
day
pierces
?
 
<EOS>
Supposing
him
to
have
disappeared
of
his
own
act
,
is
not
his
disappearance
more
accountable
and
less
cruel
?
 
<EOS>
The
fact
of
his
having
just
parted
from
your
ward
,
is
in
itself
a
sort
of
reason
for
his
going
away
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
make
his
mysterious
departure
the
less
cruel
to
me
,
it
is
true
;
but
it
relieves
it
of
cruelty
to
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
could
not
but
assent
to
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
even
as
to
me
,
"
continued
Jasper
,
still
pursuing
the
new
track
,
with
ardour
,
and
,
as
he
did
so
,
brightening
with
hope
:
 
"
he
knew
that
you
were
coming
to
me
;
he
knew
that
you
were
intrusted
to
tell
me
what
you
have
told
me
;
if
your
doing
so
has
awakened
a
new
train
of
thought
in
my
perplexed
mind
,
it
reasonably
follows
that
,
from
the
same
premises
,
he
might
have
foreseen
the
inferences
that
I
should
draw
.
 
<EOS>
Grant
that
he
did
foresee
them
;
and
even
the
cruelty
to
me
---
and
who
am
I
!
---
<EOS>
John
Jasper
,
Music
Master
,
vanishes
!
"
<EOS>
---
   
Once
more
,
Mr
Grewgious
could
not
but
assent
to
this
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
my
distrusts
,
and
terrible
distrusts
they
have
been
,
"
said
Jasper
;
"
but
your
disclosure
,
overpowering
as
it
was
at
first
---
showing
me
that
my
own
dear
boy
had
had
a
great
disappointing
reservation
from
me
,
who
so
fondly
loved
him
,
kindles
hope
within
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
do
not
extinguish
it
when
I
state
it
,
but
admit
it
to
be
a
reasonable
hope
.
 
<EOS>
I
begin
to
believe
it
possible
:
"
here
he
clasped
his
hands
:
 
"
that
he
may
have
disappeared
from
among
us
of
his
own
accord
,
and
that
he
may
yet
be
alive
and
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
came
in
at
the
moment
.
 
<EOS>
To
whom
Mr
Jasper
repeated
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
believe
it
possible
that
he
may
have
disappeared
of
his
own
accord
,
and
may
yet
be
alive
and
well
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
taking
a
seat
,
and
inquiring
:
 
<EOS>
"
Why
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
repeated
the
arguments
he
had
just
set
forth
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
had
been
less
plausible
than
they
were
,
the
good
Minor
Canon
's
mind
would
have
been
in
a
state
of
preparation
to
receive
them
,
as
exculpatory
of
his
unfortunate
pupil
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
,
too
,
did
really
attach
great
importance
to
the
lost
young
man
's
having
been
,
so
immediately
before
his
disappearance
,
placed
in
a
new
and
embarrassing
relation
towards
every
one
acquainted
with
his
projects
and
affairs
;
and
the
fact
seemed
to
him
to
present
the
question
in
a
new
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
stated
to
Mr
Sapsea
,
when
we
waited
on
him
,
"
said
Jasper
:
 
as
he
really
had
done
:
 
"
that
there
was
no
quarrel
or
difference
between
the
two
young
men
at
their
last
meeting
.
 
<EOS>
We
all
know
that
their
first
meeting
was
unfortunately
very
far
from
amicable
;
but
all
went
smoothly
and
quietly
when
they
were
last
together
at
my
house
.
 
<EOS>
My
dear
boy
was
not
in
his
usual
spirits
;
he
was
depressed
---
I
noticed
that
---
and
I
am
bound
henceforth
to
dwell
upon
the
circumstance
the
more
,
now
that
I
know
there
was
a
special
reason
for
his
being
depressed
:
 
<EOS>
a
reason
,
moreover
,
which
may
possibly
have
induced
him
to
absent
himself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
pray
to
Heaven
it
may
turn
out
so
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
pray
to
Heaven
it
may
turn
out
so
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Jasper
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
<EOS>
---
and
Mr
Grewgious
should
now
know
likewise
---
that
I
took
a
great
prepossession
against
Mr
Neville
Landless
,
arising
out
of
his
furious
conduct
on
that
first
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
came
to
you
,
extremely
apprehensive
,
on
my
dear
boy
's
behalf
,
of
his
mad
violence
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
I
even
entered
in
my
Diary
,
and
showed
the
entry
to
you
,
that
I
had
dark
forebodings
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
ought
to
be
possessed
of
the
whole
case
.
 
<EOS>
He
shall
not
,
through
any
suppression
of
mine
,
be
informed
of
a
part
of
it
,
and
kept
in
ignorance
of
another
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
him
to
be
good
enough
to
understand
that
the
communication
he
has
made
to
me
has
hopefully
influenced
my
mind
,
in
spite
of
its
having
been
,
before
this
mysterious
occurrence
took
place
,
profoundly
impressed
against
young
Landless
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
fairness
troubled
the
Minor
Canon
much
.
 
<EOS>
He
felt
that
he
was
not
as
open
in
his
own
dealing
.
 
<EOS>
He
charged
against
himself
reproachfully
that
he
had
suppressed
,
so
far
,
the
two
points
of
a
second
strong
outbreak
of
temper
against
Edwin
Drood
on
the
part
of
Neville
,
and
of
the
passion
of
jealousy
having
,
to
his
own
certain
knowledge
,
flamed
up
in
Neville
's
breast
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
convinced
of
Neville
's
innocence
of
any
part
in
the
ugly
disappearance
;
and
yet
so
many
little
circumstances
combined
so
woefully
against
him
,
that
he
dreaded
to
add
two
more
to
their
cumulative
weight
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
among
the
truest
of
men
;
but
he
had
been
balancing
in
his
mind
,
much
to
its
distress
,
whether
his
volunteering
to
tell
these
two
fragments
of
truth
,
at
this
time
,
would
not
be
tantamount
to
a
piecing
together
of
falsehood
in
the
place
of
truth
.
   
<EOS>
However
,
here
was
a
model
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
hesitated
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Addressing
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
one
placed
in
authority
by
the
revelation
he
had
brought
to
bear
on
the
mystery
(
and
surpassingly
Angular
Mr
Grewgious
became
when
he
found
himself
in
that
unexpected
position
)
,
Mr
Crisparkle
bore
his
testimony
to
Mr
Jasper
's
strict
sense
of
justice
,
and
,
expressing
his
absolute
confidence
in
the
complete
clearance
of
his
pupil
from
the
least
taint
of
suspicion
,
sooner
or
later
,
avowed
that
his
confidence
in
that
young
gentleman
had
been
formed
,
in
spite
of
his
confidential
knowledge
that
his
temper
was
of
the
hottest
and
fiercest
,
and
that
it
was
directly
incensed
against
Mr
Jasper
's
nephew
,
by
the
circumstance
of
his
romantically
supposing
himself
to
be
enamoured
of
the
same
young
lady
.
 
<EOS>
The
sanguine
reaction
manifest
in
Mr
Jasper
was
proof
even
against
this
unlooked
-
for
declaration
.
 
<EOS>
It
turned
him
paler
;
but
he
repeated
that
he
would
cling
to
the
hope
he
had
derived
from
Mr
Grewgious
;
and
that
if
no
trace
of
his
dear
boy
were
found
,
leading
to
the
dreadful
inference
that
he
had
been
made
away
with
,
he
would
cherish
unto
the
last
stretch
of
possibility
the
idea
,
that
he
might
have
absconded
of
his
own
wild
will
.
   
<EOS>
Now
,
it
fell
out
that
Mr
Crisparkle
,
going
away
from
this
conference
still
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
,
and
very
much
troubled
on
behalf
of
the
young
man
whom
he
held
as
a
kind
of
prisoner
in
his
own
house
,
took
a
memorable
night
walk
.
   
<EOS>
He
walked
to
Cloisterham
Weir
.
   
<EOS>
He
often
did
so
,
and
consequently
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
his
footsteps
tending
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
preoccupation
of
his
mind
so
hindered
him
from
planning
any
walk
,
or
taking
heed
of
the
objects
he
passed
,
that
his
first
consciousness
of
being
near
the
Weir
,
was
derived
from
the
sound
of
the
falling
water
close
at
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
did
I
come
here
!
"
<EOS>
was
his
first
thought
,
as
he
stopped
.
   
<EOS>
"
Why
did
I
come
here
!
"
<EOS>
was
his
second
.
   
<EOS>
Then
,
he
stood
intently
listening
to
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
A
familiar
passage
in
his
reading
,
about
airy
tongues
that
syllable
men
's
names
,
rose
so
unbidden
to
his
ear
<EOS>
,
that
he
put
it
from
him
with
his
hand
,
as
if
it
were
tangible
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
starlight
.
 
<EOS>
The
Weir
was
full
two
miles
above
the
spot
to
which
the
young
men
had
repaired
to
watch
the
storm
.
 
<EOS>
No
search
had
been
made
up
here
,
for
the
tide
had
been
running
strongly
down
,
at
that
time
of
the
night
of
Christmas
Eve
,
and
the
likeliest
places
for
the
discovery
of
a
body
,
if
a
fatal
accident
had
happened
under
such
circumstances
,
all
lay
---
both
when
the
tide
ebbed
,
and
when
it
flowed
again
---
between
that
spot
and
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
The
water
came
over
the
Weir
,
with
its
usual
sound
on
a
cold
starlight
night
,
and
little
could
be
seen
of
it
;
yet
Mr
Crisparkle
had
a
strange
idea
that
something
unusual
hung
about
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
He
reasoned
with
himself
:
 
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
Where
was
it
?
 
<EOS>
Put
it
to
the
proof
.
 
<EOS>
Which
sense
did
it
address
?
   
<EOS>
No
sense
reported
anything
unusual
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
listened
again
,
and
his
sense
of
hearing
again
checked
the
water
coming
over
the
Weir
,
with
its
usual
sound
on
a
cold
starlight
night
.
   
<EOS>
Knowing
very
well
that
the
mystery
with
which
his
mind
was
occupied
,
might
of
itself
give
the
place
this
haunted
air
,
he
strained
those
hawk
's
eyes
of
his
for
the
correction
of
his
sight
.
<EOS>
He
got
closer
to
the
Weir
,
and
peered
at
its
well
-
known
posts
and
timbers
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
in
the
least
unusual
was
remotely
shadowed
forth
.
<EOS>
But
he
resolved
that
he
would
come
back
early
in
the
morning
.
   
<EOS>
The
Weir
ran
through
his
broken
sleep
,
all
night
,
and
he
was
back
again
at
sunrise
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
bright
frosty
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
composition
before
him
,
when
he
stood
where
he
had
stood
last
night
,
was
clearly
discernible
in
its
minutest
details
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
surveyed
it
closely
for
some
minutes
,
and
was
about
to
withdraw
his
eyes
,
when
they
were
attracted
keenly
to
one
spot
.
   
<EOS>
He
turned
his
back
upon
the
Weir
,
and
looked
far
away
at
the
sky
,
and
at
the
earth
,
and
then
looked
again
at
that
one
spot
.
 
<EOS>
It
caught
his
sight
again
immediately
,
and
he
concentrated
his
vision
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
lose
it
now
,
though
it
was
but
such
a
speck
in
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
It
fascinated
his
sight
.
 
<EOS>
His
hands
began
plucking
off
his
coat
.
 
<EOS>
For
it
struck
him
that
at
that
spot
---
a
corner
of
the
Weir
---
something
glistened
,
which
did
not
move
and
come
over
with
the
glistening
water
-
drops
,
but
remained
stationary
.
   
<EOS>
He
assured
himself
of
this
,
he
threw
off
his
clothes
,
he
plunged
into
the
icy
water
,
and
swam
for
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Climbing
the
timbers
,
he
took
from
them
,
caught
among
their
interstices
by
its
chain
,
a
gold
watch
,
bearing
engraved
upon
its
back
E*D.
   
<EOS>
He
brought
the
watch
to
the
bank
,
swam
to
the
Weir
again
,
climbed
it
,
and
dived
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
every
hole
and
corner
of
all
the
depths
,
and
dived
and
dived
and
dived
,
until
he
could
bear
the
cold
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
His
notion
was
,
that
he
would
find
the
body
;
he
only
found
a
shirt
-
pin
sticking
in
some
mud
and
ooze
.
   
<EOS>
With
these
discoveries
he
returned
to
Cloisterham
,
and
,
taking
Neville
Landless
with
him
,
went
straight
to
the
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
was
sent
for
,
the
watch
and
shirt
-
pin
were
identified
,
Neville
was
detained
,
and
the
wildest
frenzy
and
fatuity
of
evil
report
rose
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
of
that
vindictive
and
violent
nature
,
that
but
for
his
poor
sister
,
who
alone
had
influence
over
him
,
and
out
of
whose
sight
he
was
never
to
be
trusted
,
he
would
be
in
the
daily
commission
of
murder
.
 
<EOS>
Before
coming
to
England
he
had
caused
to
be
whipped
to
death
sundry
"
Natives
"
---
nomadic
persons
,
encamping
now
in
Asia
,
now
in
Africa
,
now
in
the
West
Indies
,
and
now
at
the
North
Pole
---
vaguely
supposed
in
Cloisterham
to
be
always
black
,
always
of
great
virtue
,
always
calling
themselves
Me
,
and
everybody
else
Massa
or
Missie
(
according
to
sex
)
,
and
always
reading
tracts
of
the
obscurest
meaning
,
in
broken
English
,
but
always
accurately
understanding
them
in
the
purest
mother
tongue
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
nearly
brought
Mrs
Crisparkle
's
grey
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
.
<EOS>
(
Those
original
expressions
were
Mr
Sapsea
's
.
)
 
<EOS>
He
had
repeatedly
said
he
would
have
Mr
Crisparkle
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
repeatedly
said
he
would
have
everybody
's
life
,
and
become
in
effect
the
last
man
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
brought
down
to
Cloisterham
,
from
London
,
by
an
eminent
Philanthropist
,
and
why
?
 
<EOS>
Because
that
Philanthropist
had
expressly
declared
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
owe
it
to
my
fellow
-
creatures
that
he
should
be
,
in
the
words
of
BENTHAM
,
where
he
is
the
cause
of
the
greatest
danger
to
the
smallest
number
.
"
   
<EOS>
These
dropping
shots
from
the
blunderbusses
of
blunderheadedness
might
not
have
hit
him
in
a
vital
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
to
stand
against
a
trained
and
well
-
directed
fire
of
arms
of
precision
too
.
<EOS>
He
had
notoriously
threatened
the
lost
young
man
,
and
had
,
according
to
the
showing
of
his
own
faithful
friend
and
tutor
who
strove
so
hard
for
him
,
a
cause
of
bitter
animosity
(
created
by
himself
,
and
stated
by
himself
)
,
against
that
ill
-
starred
fellow
.
<EOS>
He
had
armed
himself
with
an
offensive
weapon
for
the
fatal
night
,
and
he
had
gone
off
early
in
the
morning
,
after
making
preparations
for
departure
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
found
with
traces
of
blood
on
him
;
truly
,
they
might
have
been
wholly
caused
as
he
represented
,
but
they
might
not
,
also
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
search
-
warrant
being
issued
for
the
examination
of
his
room
,
clothes
,
and
so
forth
,
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
destroyed
all
his
papers
,
and
rearranged
all
his
possessions
,
on
the
very
afternoon
of
the
disappearance
.
 
<EOS>
The
watch
found
at
the
Weir
was
challenged
by
the
jeweller
as
one
he
had
wound
and
set
for
Edwin
Drood
,
at
twenty
minutes
past
two
on
that
same
afternoon
;
and
it
had
run
down
,
before
being
cast
into
the
water
;
and
it
was
the
jeweller
's
positive
opinion
that
it
had
never
been
re
-
wound
.
 
<EOS>
This
would
justify
the
hypothesis
that
the
watch
was
taken
from
him
not
long
after
he
left
Mr
Jasper
's
house
at
midnight
,
in
company
with
the
last
person
seen
with
him
,
and
that
it
had
been
thrown
away
after
being
retained
some
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Why
thrown
away
?
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
murdered
,
and
so
artfully
disfigured
,
or
concealed
,
or
both
,
as
that
the
murderer
hoped
identification
to
be
impossible
,
except
from
something
that
he
wore
,
assuredly
the
murderer
would
seek
to
remove
from
the
body
the
most
lasting
,
the
best
known
,
and
the
most
easily
recognisable
,
things
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Those
things
would
be
the
watch
and
shirt
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
his
opportunities
of
casting
them
into
the
river
;
if
he
were
the
object
of
these
suspicions
,
they
were
easy
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
he
had
been
seen
by
many
persons
,
wandering
about
on
that
side
of
the
city
---
indeed
on
all
sides
of
it
---
in
a
miserable
and
seemingly
half
-
distracted
manner
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
choice
of
the
spot
,
obviously
such
criminating
evidence
had
better
take
its
chance
of
being
found
anywhere
,
rather
than
upon
himself
,
or
in
his
possession
.
 
<EOS>
Concerning
the
reconciliatory
nature
of
the
appointed
meeting
between
the
two
young
men
,
very
little
could
be
made
of
that
in
young
Landless
's
favour
;
for
it
distinctly
appeared
that
the
meeting
originated
,
not
with
him
,
but
with
Mr
Crisparkle
,
and
that
it
had
been
urged
on
by
Mr
Crisparkle
;
and
who
could
say
how
unwillingly
,
or
in
what
ill
-
conditioned
mood
,
his
enforced
pupil
had
gone
to
it
?
 
<EOS>
The
more
his
case
was
looked
into
,
the
weaker
it
became
in
every
point
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
broad
suggestion
that
the
lost
young
man
had
absconded
,
was
rendered
additionally
improbable
on
the
showing
of
the
young
lady
from
whom
he
had
so
lately
parted
;
for
;
what
did
she
say
,
with
great
earnestness
and
sorrow
,
when
interrogated
?
 
<EOS>
That
he
had
,
expressly
and
enthusiastically
,
planned
with
her
,
that
he
would
await
the
arrival
of
her
guardian
,
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
,
be
it
observed
<EOS>
,
he
disappeared
before
that
gentleman
appeared
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
suspicions
thus
urged
and
supported
,
Neville
was
detained
,
and
re
-
detained
,
and
the
search
was
pressed
on
every
hand
,
and
Jasper
laboured
night
and
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
nothing
more
was
found
.
 
<EOS>
No
discovery
being
made
,
which
proved
the
lost
man
to
be
dead
,
it
at
length
became
necessary
to
release
the
person
suspected
of
having
made
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
was
set
at
large
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
consequence
ensued
which
Mr
Crisparkle
had
too
well
foreseen
.
 
<EOS>
Neville
must
leave
the
place
,
for
the
place
shunned
him
and
cast
him
out
.
 
<EOS>
Even
had
it
not
been
so
,
the
dear
old
china
shepherdess
would
have
worried
herself
to
death
with
fears
for
her
son
,
and
with
general
trepidation
occasioned
by
their
having
such
an
inmate
.
 
<EOS>
Even
had
that
not
been
so
,
the
authority
to
which
the
Minor
Canon
deferred
officially
,
would
have
settled
the
point
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
quoth
the
Dean
,
"
human
justice
may
err
,
but
it
must
act
according
to
its
lights
.
 
<EOS>
The
days
of
taking
sanctuary
are
past
.
 
<EOS>
This
young
man
must
not
take
sanctuary
with
us
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
mean
that
he
must
leave
my
house
,
sir
?
"
   
"
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
returned
the
prudent
Dean
,
"
<EOS>
I
claim
no
authority
in
your
house
.
 
<EOS>
I
merely
confer
with
you
,
on
the
painful
necessity
you
find
yourself
under
,
of
depriving
this
young
man
of
the
great
advantages
of
your
counsel
and
instruction
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
lamentable
,
sir
,
"
Mr
Crisparkle
represented
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Very
much
so
,
"
the
Dean
assented
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
it
be
a
necessity
---
"
Mr
Crisparkle
faltered
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
you
unfortunately
find
it
to
be
,
"
returned
the
Dean
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
bowed
submissively
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
to
prejudge
his
case
,
sir
,
but
I
am
sensible
<EOS>
that
---
"
   
"
<EOS>
Just
so
.
 
<EOS>
Perfectly
.
 
<EOS>
As
you
say
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
interposed
the
Dean
,
nodding
his
head
smoothly
,
"
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
alternative
,
as
your
good
sense
has
discovered
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
entirely
satisfied
of
his
perfect
innocence
,
sir
,
nevertheless
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
-
e
-
ell
!
"
said
the
Dean
,
in
a
more
confidential
tone
,
and
slightly
glancing
around
him
,
"
I
would
not
say
so
,
generally
.
 
<EOS>
Not
generally
.
 
<EOS>
Enough
of
suspicion
attaches
to
him
to
---
<EOS>
no
,
I
think
I
would
not
say
so
,
generally
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
bowed
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
become
us
,
perhaps
,
"
pursued
the
Dean
,
"
to
be
partisans
.
 
<EOS>
Not
partisans
.
 
<EOS>
We
clergy
keep
our
hearts
warm
and
our
heads
cool
,
and
we
hold
a
judicious
middle
course
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
object
,
sir
,
to
my
having
stated
in
public
,
emphatically
,
that
he
will
reappear
here
,
whenever
any
new
suspicion
may
be
awakened
,
or
any
new
circumstance
may
come
to
light
in
this
extraordinary
matter
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
,
"
returned
the
Dean
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
yet
,
do
you
know
,
I
do
n't
think
,
"
with
a
very
nice
and
neat
emphasis
on
those
two
words
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
DON'T
THINK
I
would
state
it
emphatically
.
 
<EOS>
State
it
?
 
<EOS>
Ye

<EOS>
But
emphatically
?
 
<EOS>
No
-

<EOS>
I
THINK
not

<EOS>
In
point
of
fact
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
keeping
our
hearts
warm
and
our
heads
cool
,
we
clergy
need
do
nothing
emphatically
.
"
   
<EOS>
So
Minor
Canon
Row
knew
Neville
Landless
no
more
;
and
he
went
whithersoever
he
would
,
or
could
,
with
a
blight
upon
his
name
and
fame
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
then
that
John
Jasper
silently
resumed
his
place
in
the
choir
.
 
<EOS>
Haggard
and
red
-
eyed
,
his
hopes
plainly
had
deserted
him
,
his
sanguine
mood
was
gone
,
and
all
his
worst
misgivings
had
come
back
.
 
<EOS>
A
day
or
two
afterwards
,
while
unrobing
,
he
took
his
Diary
from
a
pocket
of
his
coat
,
turned
the
leaves
,
and
with
an
impressive
look
,
and
without
one
spoken
word
,
handed
this
entry
to
Mr
Crisparkle
to
read
:
   
"
My
dear
boy
is
murdered
.
 
<EOS>
The
discovery
of
the
watch
and
shirt
-
pin
convinces
me
that
he
was
murdered
that
night
,
and
that
his
jewellery
was
taken
from
him
to
prevent
identification
by
its
means
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
delusive
hopes
I
had
founded
on
his
separation
from
his
betrothed
wife
<EOS>
,
I
give
to
the
winds
.
 
<EOS>
They
perish
before
this
fatal
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
I
now
swear
,
and
record
the
oath
on
this
page
,
That
I
nevermore
will
discuss
this
mystery
with
any
human
creature
until
I
hold
the
clue
to
it
in
my
hand

<EOS>
That
I
never
will
relax
in
my
secrecy

That
I
will
fasten
the
crime

That
I

and
Mr
Crisparkle
sat
in
a
waiting
-
room
in
the
London
chief
offices
of
the
Haven
of
Philanthropy
,
until
he
could
have
audience
of
Mr
Honeythunder
.
   
<EOS>
In
his
college
days
of
athletic
exercises
,
Mr
Crisparkle
had
known
professors
of
the
Noble
Art
of
fisticuffs
,
and
had
attended
two
or
three
of
their
gloved
gatherings
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
now
an
opportunity
of
observing
that
as
to
the
phrenological
formation
of
the
backs
of
their
heads
,
the
Professing
Philanthropists
were
uncommonly
like
the
Pugilists
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
development
of
all
those
organs
which
constitute
,
or
attend
,
a
propensity
to
"
pitch
into
"
your
fellow
-
creatures
,
the
Philanthropists
were
remarkably
favoured
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
several
Professors
passing
in
and
out
,
with
exactly
the
aggressive
air
upon
them
of
being
ready
for
a
turn
-
up
with
any
Novice
who
might
happen
to
be
on
hand
,
that
Mr
Crisparkle
well
remembered
in
the
circles
of
the
Fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Preparations
were
in
progress
for
a
moral
little
Mill
somewhere
on
the
rural
circuit
,
and
other
Professors
were
backing
this
or
that
Heavy
-
Weight
as
good
for
such
or
such
speech
-
making
hits
,
so
very
much
after
the
manner
of
the
sporting
publicans
,
that
the
intended
Resolutions
might
have
been
Rounds
.
 
<EOS>
In
an
official
manager
of
these
displays
much
celebrated
for
his
platform
tactics
,
Mr
Crisparkle
recognised
(
in
a
suit
of
black
)
<EOS>
the
counterpart
of
a
deceased
benefactor
of
his
species
,
an
eminent
public
character
,
once
known
to
fame
as
Frosty
-
faced
Fogo
,
who
in
days
of
yore
superintended
the
formation
of
the
magic
circle
with
the
ropes
and
stakes
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
only
three
conditions
of
resemblance
wanting
between
these
Professors
and
those
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
the
Philanthropists
were
in
very
bad
training
:
much
too
fleshy
,
and
presenting
,
both
in
face
and
figure
,
a
superabundance
of
what
is
known
to
Pugilistic
Experts
as
Suet
Pudding
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
the
Philanthropists
had
not
the
good
temper
of
the
Pugilists
,
and
used
worse
language
.
 
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
their
fighting
code
stood
in
great
need
of
revision
,
as
empowering
them
not
only
to
bore
their
man
to
the
ropes
,
but
to
bore
him
to
the
confines
of
distraction
;
also
to
hit
him
when
he
was
down
,
hit
him
anywhere
<EOS>
and
anyhow
,
kick
him
,
stamp
upon
him
,
gouge
him
,
and
maul
him
behind
his
back
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
last
particulars
the
Professors
of
the
Noble
Art
were
much
nobler
than
the
Professors
of
Philanthropy
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
was
so
completely
lost
in
musing
on
these
similarities
and
dissimilarities
,
at
the
same
time
watching
the
crowd
which
came
and
went
by
,
always
,
as
it
seemed
,
on
errands
of
antagonistically
snatching
something
from
somebody
,
and
never
giving
anything
to
anybody
,
that
his
name
was
called
before
he
heard
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
at
length
responding
,
he
was
shown
by
a
miserably
shabby
and
underpaid
stipendiary
Philanthropist
(
who
could
hardly
have
done
worse
if
he
had
taken
service
with
a
declared
enemy
of
the
human
race
)
to
Mr
Honeythunder
's
room
.
   
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
"
said
Mr
Honeythunder
,
in
his
tremendous
voice
,
like
a
schoolmaster
issuing
orders
to
a
boy
of
whom
he
had
a
bad
opinion
,
"
sit
down
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
seated
himself
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Honeythunder
having
signed
the
remaining
few
score
of
a
few
thousand
circulars
,
calling
upon
a
corresponding
number
of
families
without
means
to
come
forward
,
stump
up
instantly
,
and
be
Philanthropists
,
or
go
to
the
Devil
,
another
shabby
stipendiary
Philanthropist
(
highly
disinterested
,
if
in
earnest
)
gathered
these
into
a
basket
and
walked
off
with
them
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
said
Mr
Honeythunder
,
turning
his
chair
half
round
towards
him
when
they
were
alone
,
and
squaring
his
arms
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
and
his
brows
knitted
,
as
if
he
added
,
I
am
going
to
make
short
work
of
YOU
:
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
we
entertain
different
views
,
you
and
I
,
sir
,
of
the
sanctity
of
human
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
we
?
"
returned
the
Minor
Canon
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
do
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Might
I
ask
you
,
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
:
 
<EOS>
"
what
are
your
views
on
that
subject
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
human
life
is
a
thing
to
be
held
sacred
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Might
I
ask
you
,
"
pursued
the
Minor
Canon
as
before
:
 
"
what
you
suppose
to
be
my
views
on
that
subject
?
"
   
"
By
George
,
sir
!
"
returned
the
Philanthropist
,
squaring
his
arms
still
more
,
as
he
frowned
on
Mr
Crisparkle
:
 
<EOS>
"
they
are
best
known
to
yourself
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Readily
admitted
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
began
by
saying
that
we
took
different
views
,
you
know
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
<EOS>
(
or
you
could
not
say
so
)
<EOS>
you
must
have
set
up
some
views
as
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Pray
,
what
views
HAVE
you
set
up
as
mine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
man
---
and
a
young
man
,
"
said
Mr
Honeythunder
,
as
if
that
made
the
matter
infinitely
worse
,
and
he
could
have
easily
borne
the
loss
of
an
old
one
,
"
swept
off
the
face
of
the
earth
by
a
deed
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
call
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Murder
,
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
call
the
doer
of
that
deed
,
sir
?
   
<EOS>
"
A
murderer
,
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
you
admit
so
much
,
sir
,
"
retorted
Mr
Honeythunder
,
in
his
most
offensive
manner
;
"
and
I
candidly
tell
you
that
I
did
n't
expect
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
Here
he
lowered
heavily
at
Mr
Crisparkle
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
explain
what
you
mean
by
those
very
unjustifiable
expressions
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
sit
here
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
Philanthropist
,
raising
his
voice
to
a
roar
,
"
to
be
browbeaten
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
the
only
other
person
present
,
no
one
can
possibly
know
that
better
than
I
do
,
"
returned
the
Minor
Canon
very
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
interrupt
your
explanation
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Murder
!
"
proceeded
Mr
Honeythunder
,
in
a
kind
of
boisterous
reverie
,
with
his
platform
folding
of
his
arms
,
and
his
platform
nod
of
abhorrent
reflection
after
each
short
sentiment
of
a
word
.
"
<EOS>
Bloodshed
!
 
<EOS>
Abel
!
 
<EOS>
Cain
!
 
<EOS>
I
hold
no
terms
with
Cain
.
 
<EOS>
I
repudiate
with
a
shudder
the
red
hand
when
it
is
offered
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Instead
of
instantly
leaping
into
his
chair
and
cheering
himself
hoarse
,
as
the
Brotherhood
in
public
meeting
assembled
would
infallibly
have
done
on
this
cue
,
Mr
Crisparkle
merely
reversed
the
quiet
crossing
of
his
legs
,
and
said
mildly
:
 
"
Do
n't
let
me
interrupt
your
explanation
---
when
you
begin
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Commandments
say
,
no
murder
.
 
<EOS>
NO
murder
,
sir
!
"
proceeded
Mr
Honeythunder
,
platformally
pausing
as
if
he
took
Mr
Crisparkle
to
task
for
having
distinctly
asserted
that
they
said
:
 
You
may
do
a
little
murder
,
and
then
leave
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
they
also
say
,
you
shall
bear
no
false
witness
,
"
observed
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Enough
!
"
bellowed
Mr
Honeythunder
,
with
a
solemnity
and
severity
that
would
have
brought
the
house
down
at
a
meeting
,
"
E
-
e
-
nough

<EOS>
My
late
wards
being
now
of
age
,
and
I
being
released
from
a
trust
which
I
can
not
contemplate
without
a
thrill
of
horror
,
there
are
the
accounts
which
you
have
undertaken
to
accept
on
their
behalf
,
and
there
is
a
statement
of
the
balance
which
you
have
undertaken
to
receive
,
and
which
you
can
not
receive
too
soon
.
 
<EOS>
And
let
me
tell
you
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
wish
that
,
as
a
man
and
a
Minor
Canon
,
you
were
better
employed
,
"
with
a
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
Better
employed
,
"
with
another
nod
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bet
-
ter
em
-
ployed

"
<EOS>
with
another
and
the
three
nods
added
up
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
rose
;
a
little
heated
in
the
face
,
but
with
perfect
command
of
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Honeythunder
,
"
he
said
,
taking
up
the
papers
referred
to
:
 
"
my
being
better
or
worse
employed
than
I
am
at
present
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
opinion
.
 
<EOS>
You
might
think
me
better
employed
in
enrolling
myself
a
member
of
your
Society
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
indeed
,
sir
!
"
retorted
Mr
Honeythunder
,
shaking
his
head
in
a
threatening
manner
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
better
for
you
if
you
had
done
that
long
ago
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
otherwise
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Or
,
"
said
Mr
Honeythunder
,
shaking
his
head
again
,
"
I
might
think
one
of
your
profession
better
employed
in
devoting
himself
to
the
discovery
and
punishment
of
guilt
than
in
leaving
that
duty
to
be
undertaken
by
a
layman
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
may
regard
my
profession
from
a
point
of
view
which
teaches
me
that
its
first
duty
is
towards
those
who
are
in
necessity
and
tribulation
,
who
are
desolate
and
oppressed
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
have
quite
clearly
satisfied
myself
that
it
is
no
part
of
my
profession
to
make
professions
,
I
say
no
more
of
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
owe
it
to
Mr
Neville
,
and
to
Mr
Neville
's
sister
(
and
in
a
much
lower
degree
to
myself
)
,
to
say
to
you
that
I
KNOW
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
full
possession
and
understanding
of
Mr
Neville
's
mind
and
heart
at
the
time
of
this
occurrence
;
and
that
,
without
in
the
least
colouring
or
concealing
what
was
to
be
deplored
in
him
and
required
to
be
corrected
,
I
feel
certain
that
his
tale
is
true
.
<EOS>
Feeling
that
certainty
,
I
befriend
him
.
 
<EOS>
As
long
as
that
certainty
shall
last
,
I
will
befriend
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
any
consideration
could
shake
me
in
this
resolve
,
I
should
be
so
ashamed
of
myself
for
my
meanness
,
that
no
man
's
good
opinion
---
no
,
nor
no
woman
's
---
so
gained
,
could
compensate
me
for
the
loss
of
my
own
.
"
   
<EOS>
Good
fellow
!
<EOS>
manly
fellow
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
so
modest
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
more
self
-
assertion
in
the
Minor
Canon
than
in
the
schoolboy
who
had
stood
in
the
breezy
playing
-
fields
keeping
a
wicket
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
simply
and
staunchly
true
to
his
duty
alike
in
the
large
case
and
in
the
small
.
 
<EOS>
So
all
true
souls
ever
are
.
 
<EOS>
So
every
true
soul
ever
was
,
ever
is
,
and
ever
will
be
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
nothing
little
to
the
really
great
in
spirit
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
who
do
you
make
out
did
the
deed
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Mr
Honeythunder
,
turning
on
him
abruptly
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
forbid
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
that
in
my
desire
to
clear
one
man
I
should
lightly
criminate
another
!
 
<EOS>
I
accuse
no
one
,
"
   
"
Tcha
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Honeythunder
with
great
disgust
;
for
this
was
by
no
means
the
principle
on
which
the
Philanthropic
Brotherhood
usually
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
,
sir
,
you
are
not
a
disinterested
witness
,
we
must
bear
in
mind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
an
interested
one
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mr
Crisparkle
,
smiling
innocently
,
at
a
loss
to
imagine
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
certain
stipend
,
sir
,
paid
to
you
for
your
pupil
,
which
may
have
warped
your
judgment
a
bit
,
"
said
Mr
Honeythunder
,
coarsely
.
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
I
expect
to
retain
it
still
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
returned
,
enlightened
;
"
do
you
mean
that
too
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
professional
Philanthropist
,
getting
up
and
thrusting
his
hands
down
into
his
trousers
-
pockets
,
"
I
do
n't
go
about
measuring
people
for
caps
.
 
<EOS>
If
people
find
I
have
any
about
me
that
fit
'em
,
they
can
put
'em
on
and
wear
'em
,
if
they
like
.
<EOS>
That
's
their
look
out
:
 
not
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
eyed
him
with
a
just
indignation
,
and
took
him
to
task
thus
:
   
"
<EOS>
Mr
Honeythunder
,
I
hoped
when
I
came
in
here
that
I
might
be
under
no
necessity
of
commenting
on
the
introduction
of
platform
manners
or
platform
manoeuvres
among
the
decent
forbearances
of
private
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
you
have
given
me
such
a
specimen
of
both
<EOS>
,
that
I
should
be
a
fit
subject
for
both
if
I
remained
silent
respecting
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
detestable
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
do
n't
suit
YOU
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
They
are
,
"
repeated
Mr
Crisparkle
,
without
noticing
the
interruption
,
"
detestable
.
 
<EOS>
They
violate
equally
the
justice
that
should
belong
to
Christians
,
and
the
restraints
that
should
belong
to
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
You
assume
a
great
crime
to
have
been
committed
by
one
whom
I
,
acquainted
with
the
attendant
circumstances
,
and
having
numerous
reasons
on
my
side
,
devoutly
believe
to
be
innocent
of
it
.
<EOS>
Because
I
differ
from
you
on
that
vital
point
,
what
is
your
platform
resource
?
 
<EOS>
Instantly
to
turn
upon
me
,
charging
that
I
have
no
sense
of
the
enormity
of
the
crime
itself
,
but
am
its
aider
and
abettor
!
 
<EOS>
So
,
another
time
---
taking
me
as
representing
your
opponent
in
other
cases
---
you
set
up
a
platform
credulity
;
a
moved
and
seconded
and
carried
-
unanimously
profession
of
faith
in
some
ridiculous
delusion
or
mischievous
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
I
decline
to
believe
it
,
and
you
fall
back
upon
your
platform
resource
of
proclaiming
that
I
believe
nothing
;
that
because
I
will
not
bow
down
to
a
false
God
of
your
making
,
I
deny
the
true
God
!
 
<EOS>
Another
time
you
make
the
platform
discovery
that
War
is
a
calamity
,
and
you
propose
to
abolish
it
by
a
string
of
twisted
resolutions
tossed
into
the
air
like
the
tail
of
a
kite
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
admit
the
discovery
to
be
yours
in
the
least
,
and
I
have
not
a
grain
of
faith
in
your
remedy
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
your
platform
resource
of
representing
me
as
revelling
in
the
horrors
of
a
battle
-
field
like
a
fiend
incarnate
!
<EOS>
Another
time
,
in
another
of
your
undiscriminating
platform
rushes
,
you
would
punish
the
sober
for
the
drunken
.
 
<EOS>
I
claim
consideration
for
the
comfort
,
convenience
,
and
refreshment
of
the
sober
;
and
you
presently
make
platform
proclamation
that
I
have
a
depraved
desire
to
turn
Heaven
's
creatures
into
swine
and
wild
beasts
!
 
<EOS>
In
all
such
cases
your
movers
,
and
your
seconders
,
and
your
supporters
 
---
your
regular
Professors
of
all
degrees
,
run
amuck
like
so
many
mad
Malays
;
habitually
attributing
the
lowest
and
basest
motives
with
the
utmost
recklessness
<EOS>
(
let
me
call
your
attention
to
a
recent
instance
in
yourself
for
which
you
should
blush
)
,
and
quoting
figures
which
you
know
to
be
as
wilfully
onesided
as
a
statement
of
any
complicated
account
that
should
be
all
Creditor
side
and
no
Debtor
,
or
all
Debtor
side
and
no
Creditor
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
it
is
,
Mr
Honeythunder
,
that
I
consider
the
platform
a
sufficiently
bad
example
and
a
sufficiently
bad
school
,
even
in
public
life
;
but
hold
that
,
carried
into
private
life
,
it
becomes
an
unendurable
nuisance
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
These
are
strong
words
,
sir
!
"
exclaimed
the
Philanthropist
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
hope
so
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
morning
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
walked
out
of
the
Haven
at
a
great
rate
,
but
soon
fell
into
his
regular
brisk
pace
,
and
soon
had
a
smile
upon
his
face
as
he
went
along
,
wondering
what
the
china
shepherdess
would
have
said
if
she
had
seen
him
pounding
Mr
Honeythunder
in
the
late
little
lively
affair
.
 
<EOS>
For
Mr
Crisparkle
had
just
enough
of
harmless
vanity
to
hope
that
he
had
hit
hard
,
and
to
glow
with
the
belief
that
he
had
trimmed
the
Philanthropic
Jacket
pretty
handsomely
.
   
<EOS>
He
took
himself
to
Staple
Inn
,
but
not
to
P*J*T
and
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
Full
many
a
creaking
stair
he
climbed
before
he
reached
some
attic
rooms
in
a
corner
,
turned
the
latch
of
their
unbolted
door
,
and
stood
beside
the
table
of
Neville
Landless
.
   
<EOS>
An
air
of
retreat
and
solitude
hung
about
the
rooms
and
about
their
inhabitant
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
much
worn
,
and
so
were
they
.
 
<EOS>
Their
sloping
ceilings
,
cumbrous
rusty
locks
and
grates
,
and
heavy
wooden
bins
and
beams
,
slowly
mouldering
withal
,
had
a
prisonous
look
,
and
he
had
the
haggard
face
of
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
sunlight
shone
in
at
the
ugly
garret
-
window
,
which
had
a
penthouse
to
itself
thrust
out
among
the
tiles
;
and
on
the
cracked
and
smoke
-
blackened
parapet
beyond
,
some
of
the
deluded
sparrows
of
the
place
rheumatically
hopped
,
like
little
feathered
cripples
who
had
left
their
crutches
in
their
nests
;
and
there
was
a
play
of
living
leaves
at
hand
that
changed
the
air
,
and
made
an
imperfect
sort
of
music
in
it
that
would
have
been
melody
in
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
The
rooms
were
sparely
furnished
,
but
with
good
store
of
books
.
<EOS>
Everything
expressed
the
abode
of
a
poor
student
.
 
<EOS>
That
Mr
Crisparkle
had
been
either
chooser
,
lender
,
or
donor
of
the
books
,
or
that
he
combined
the
three
characters
,
<EOS>
might
have
been
easily
seen
in
the
friendly
beam
of
his
eyes
upon
them
as
he
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
goes
it
,
Neville
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
good
heart
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
and
working
away
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
wish
your
eyes
were
not
quite
so
large
and
not
quite
so
bright
,
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
,
slowly
releasing
the
hand
he
had
taken
in
his
.
   
<EOS>
"
They
brighten
at
the
sight
of
you
,
"
returned
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
"
If
you
were
to
fall
away
from
me
,
they
would
soon
be
dull
enough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Rally
,
rally
!
"
urged
the
other
,
in
a
stimulating
tone
.
 
<EOS>
"
Fight
for
it
,
Neville
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
dying
,
I
feel
as
if
a
word
from
you
would
rally
me
;
if
my
pulse
had
stopped
,
I
feel
as
if
your
touch
would
make
it
beat
again
,
"
said
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
HAVE
rallied
,
and
am
doing
famously
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
turned
him
with
his
face
a
little
more
towards
the
light
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
a
ruddier
touch
here
,
Neville
,
"
he
said
,
indicating
his
own
healthy
cheek
by
way
of
pattern
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
want
more
sun
to
shine
upon
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
drooped
suddenly
,
as
he
replied
in
a
lowered
voice
:
 
"
I
am
not
hardy
enough
for
that
,
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
become
so
,
but
I
can
not
bear
it
yet
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
had
gone
through
those
Cloisterham
streets
as
I
did
;
if
you
had
seen
,
as
I
did
,
those
averted
eyes
,
and
the
better
sort
of
people
silently
giving
me
too
much
room
to
pass
,
that
I
might
not
touch
them
or
come
near
them
,
you
would
n't
think
it
quite
unreasonable
that
I
can
not
go
about
in
the
daylight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
poor
fellow
!
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
,
in
a
tone
so
purely
sympathetic
that
the
young
man
caught
his
hand
,
"
I
never
said
it
was
unreasonable
;
never
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
should
like
you
to
do
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
that
would
give
me
the
strongest
motive
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
yet
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
persuade
myself
that
the
eyes
of
even
the
stream
of
strangers
I
pass
in
this
vast
city
look
at
me
without
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
I
feel
marked
and
tainted
,
even
when
I
go
out
---
as
I
do
only
---
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
darkness
covers
me
then
,
and
I
take
courage
from
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
stood
looking
down
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
have
changed
my
name
,
"
said
Neville
,
"
I
would
have
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
you
wisely
pointed
out
to
me
,
I
ca
n't
do
that
,
for
it
would
look
like
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
could
have
gone
to
some
distant
place
,
I
might
have
found
relief
in
that
,
but
the
thing
is
not
to
be
thought
of
,
for
the
same
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Hiding
and
escaping
would
be
the
construction
in
either
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
a
little
hard
to
be
so
tied
to
a
stake
,
and
innocent
;
but
I
do
n't
complain
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
expect
no
miracle
to
help
you
,
Neville
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
compassionately
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
know
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
ordinary
fulness
of
time
and
circumstances
is
all
I
have
to
trust
to
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
will
right
you
at
last
,
Neville
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
believe
,
and
I
hope
I
may
live
to
know
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
perceiving
that
the
despondent
mood
into
which
he
was
falling
cast
a
shadow
on
the
Minor
Canon
,
and
(
it
may
be
)
<EOS>
feeling
that
the
broad
hand
upon
his
shoulder
was
not
then
quite
as
steady
as
its
own
natural
strength
had
rendered
it
when
it
first
touched
him
just
now
,
he
brightened
and
said
:
   
"
<EOS>
Excellent
circumstances
for
study
,
anyhow
!
<EOS>
and
you
know
,
Mr
Crisparkle
,
what
need
I
have
of
study
in
all
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
mention
that
you
have
advised
me
to
study
for
the
difficult
profession
of
the
law
,
specially
,
and
that
of
course
I
am
guiding
myself
by
the
advice
of
such
a
friend
and
helper
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
good
friend
and
helper
!
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
He
took
the
fortifying
hand
from
his
shoulder
,
and
kissed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
beamed
at
the
books
,
but
not
so
brightly
as
when
he
had
entered
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
gather
from
your
silence
on
the
subject
that
my
late
guardian
is
adverse
,
Mr
Crisparkle
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Minor
Canon
answered
:
 
"
Your
late
guardian
is
a
---
a
most
unreasonable
person
,
and
it
signifies
nothing
to
any
reasonable
person
whether
he
is
ADverse
,
PERverse
,
or
the
REverse
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
for
me
that
I
have
enough
with
economy
to
live
upon
,
"
sighed
Neville
,
half
wearily
and
half
cheerily
,
"
while
I
wait
to
be
learned
,
and
wait
to
be
righted
!
 
<EOS>
Else
I
might
have
proved
the
proverb
,
that
while
the
grass
grows
,
the
steed
starves
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
opened
some
books
as
he
said
it
,
and
was
soon
immersed
in
their
interleaved
and
annotated
passages
;
while
Mr
Crisparkle
sat
beside
him
,
expounding
,
correcting
,
and
advising
.
 
<EOS>
The
Minor
Canon
's
Cathedral
duties
made
these
visits
of
his
difficult
to
accomplish
,
and
only
to
be
compassed
at
intervals
of
many
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
as
serviceable
as
they
were
precious
to
Neville
Landless
.
   
<EOS>
When
they
had
got
through
such
studies
as
they
had
in
hand
,
they
stood
leaning
on
the
window
-
sill
,
and
looking
down
upon
the
patch
of
garden
.
 
<EOS>
"
Next
week
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
you
will
cease
to
be
alone
,
and
will
have
a
devoted
companion
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
"
returned
Neville
,
"
this
seems
an
uncongenial
place
to
bring
my
sister
to
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
think
so
,
"
said
the
Minor
Canon
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
is
duty
to
be
done
here
;
and
there
are
womanly
feeling
,
sense
,
and
courage
wanted
here
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
meant
,
"
explained
Neville
,
"
that
the
surroundings
are
so
dull
and
unwomanly
,
and
that
Helena
can
have
no
suitable
friend
or
society
here
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
have
only
to
remember
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
that
you
are
here
yourself
,
and
that
she
has
to
draw
you
into
the
sunlight
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
They
were
silent
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
Mr
Crisparkle
began
anew
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
we
first
spoke
together
,
Neville
,
you
told
me
that
your
sister
had
risen
out
of
the
disadvantages
of
your
past
lives
as
superior
to
you
as
the
tower
of
Cloisterham
Cathedral
is
higher
than
the
chimneys
of
Minor
Canon
Corner
.
 
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Right
well
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
inclined
to
think
it
at
the
time
an
enthusiastic
flight
.
 
<EOS>
No
matter
what
I
think
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
What
I
would
emphasise
is
,
that
under
the
head
of
Pride
your
sister
is
a
great
and
opportune
example
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Under
ALL
heads
that
are
included
in
the
composition
of
a
fine
character
,
she
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Say
so
;
but
take
this
one
.
 
<EOS>
Your
sister
has
learnt
how
to
govern
what
is
proud
in
her
nature
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
dominate
it
even
when
it
is
wounded
through
her
sympathy
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
she
has
suffered
deeply
in
those
same
streets
where
you
suffered
deeply
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
her
life
is
darkened
by
the
cloud
that
darkens
yours
.
 
<EOS>
But
bending
her
pride
into
a
grand
composure
that
is
not
haughty
or
aggressive
,
but
is
a
sustained
confidence
in
you
and
in
the
truth
,
she
has
won
her
way
through
those
streets
until
she
passes
along
them
as
high
in
the
general
respect
as
any
one
who
treads
them
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
and
hour
of
her
life
since
Edwin
Drood
's
disappearance
,
she
has
faced
malignity
and
folly
---
for
you
---
as
only
a
brave
nature
well
directed
can
.
 
<EOS>
So
it
will
be
with
her
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
Another
and
weaker
kind
of
pride
might
sink
broken
-
hearted
,
but
never
such
a
pride
as
hers
:
 
which
knows
no
shrinking
,
and
can
get
no
mastery
over
her
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
pale
cheek
beside
him
flushed
under
the
comparison
,
and
the
hint
implied
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
do
all
I
can
to
imitate
her
,
"
said
Neville
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
so
,
and
be
a
truly
brave
man
,
as
she
is
a
truly
brave
woman
,
"
answered
Mr
Crisparkle
stoutly
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
growing
dark
.
 
<EOS>
Will
you
go
my
way
with
me
,
when
it
is
quite
dark
?
 
<EOS>
Mind
!
<EOS>
it
is
not
I
who
wait
for
darkness
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
replied
,
that
he
would
accompany
him
directly
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Crisparkle
said
he
had
a
moment
's
call
to
make
on
Mr
Grewgious
as
an
act
of
courtesy
,
and
would
run
across
to
that
gentleman
's
chambers
,
and
rejoin
Neville
on
his
own
doorstep
,
if
he
would
come
down
there
to
meet
him
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
bolt
upright
as
usual
,
sat
taking
his
wine
in
the
dusk
at
his
open
window
;
his
wineglass
and
decanter
on
the
round
table
at
his
elbow
;
himself
and
his
legs
on
the
window
-
seat
;
only
one
hinge
in
his
whole
body
,
like
a
bootjack
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
reverend
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
abundant
offers
of
hospitality
,
which
were
as
cordially
declined
as
made
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
is
your
charge
getting
on
over
the
way
in
the
set
that
I
had
the
pleasure
of
recommending
to
you
as
vacant
and
eligible
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
replied
suitably
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
you
approve
of
them
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
because
I
entertain
a
sort
of
fancy
for
having
him
under
my
eye
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Grewgious
had
to
turn
his
eye
up
considerably
before
he
could
see
the
chambers
,
the
phrase
was
to
be
taken
figuratively
and
not
literally
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
how
did
you
leave
Mr
Jasper
,
reverend
sir
?
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
had
left
him
pretty
well
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
where
did
you
leave
Mr
Jasper
,
reverend
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
had
left
him
at
Cloisterham
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
when
did
you
leave
Mr
Jasper
,
reverend
sir
?
"
 
<EOS>
That
morning
.
   
<EOS>
"
Umps
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
did
n't
say
he
was
coming
,
perhaps
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Coming
where
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Anywhere
,
for
instance
?
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Because
here
he
is
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
who
had
asked
all
these
questions
,
with
his
preoccupied
glance
directed
out
at
window
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
do
n't
look
agreeable
,
does
he
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
was
craning
towards
the
window
,
when
Mr
Grewgious
added
:
   
"
<EOS>
If
you
will
kindly
step
round
here
behind
me
,
in
the
gloom
of
the
room
,
and
will
cast
your
eye
at
the
second
-
floor
landing
window
in
yonder
house
,
I
think
you
will
hardly
fail
to
see
a
slinking
individual
in
whom
I
recognise
our
local
friend
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Umps
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
added
,
turning
his
face
so
abruptly
that
his
head
nearly
came
into
collision
with
Mr
Crisparkle
's
:
 
"
what
should
you
say
that
our
local
friend
was
up
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
last
passage
he
had
been
shown
in
the
Diary
returned
on
Mr
Crisparkle
's
mind
with
the
force
of
a
strong
recoil
,
and
he
asked
Mr
Grewgious
if
he
thought
it
possible
that
Neville
was
to
be
harassed
by
the
keeping
of
a
watch
upon
him
?
   
<EOS>
"
A
watch
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
Mr
Grewgious
musingly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Which
would
not
only
of
itself
haunt
and
torture
his
life
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
warmly
,
"
but
would
expose
him
to
the
torment
of
a
perpetually
reviving
suspicion
,
whatever
he
might
do
,
or
wherever
he
might
go
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
!
<EOS>
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
musingly
still
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
I
see
him
waiting
for
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
doubt
you
do
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
WOULD
you
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
my
getting
up
to
see
you
out
,
and
to
go
out
to
join
him
,
and
to
go
the
way
that
you
were
going
,
and
to
take
no
notice
of
our
local
friend
?
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
entertain
a
sort
of
fancy
for
having
HIM
under
my
eye
to
-
night
,
do
you
know
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
with
a
significant
need
complied
;
and
rejoining
Neville
,
went
away
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
dined
together
,
and
parted
at
the
yet
unfinished
and
undeveloped
railway
station
:
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
to
get
home
<EOS>
;
Neville
to
walk
the
streets
,
cross
the
bridges
,
make
a
wide
round
of
the
city
in
the
friendly
darkness
,
and
tire
himself
out
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
midnight
when
he
returned
from
his
solitary
expedition
and
climbed
his
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
hot
,
and
the
windows
of
the
staircase
were
all
wide
open
.
 
<EOS>
Coming
to
the
top
,
it
gave
him
a
passing
chill
of
surprise
<EOS>
(
there
being
no
rooms
but
his
up
there
)
to
find
a
stranger
sitting
on
the
window
-
sill
,
more
after
the
manner
of
a
venturesome
glazier
than
an
amateur
ordinarily
careful
of
his
neck
;
in
fact
,
so
much
more
outside
the
window
than
inside
,
as
to
suggest
the
thought
that
he
must
have
come
up
by
the
water
-
spout
instead
of
the
stairs
.
   
<EOS>
The
stranger
said
nothing
until
Neville
put
his
key
in
his
door
;
then
,
seeming
to
make
sure
of
his
identity
from
the
action
,
he
spoke
:
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
he
said
,
coming
from
the
window
with
a
frank
and
smiling
air
,
and
a
prepossessing
address
;
"
the
beans
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
was
quite
at
a
loss
.
   
<EOS>
"
Runners
,
"
said
the
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Scarlet
.
 
<EOS>
Next
door
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
"
returned
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
the
mignonette
and
wall
-
flower
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
same
,
"
said
the
visitor
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
walk
in
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
lighted
his
candles
,
and
the
visitor
sat
down
.
 
<EOS>
A
handsome
gentleman
,
with
a
young
face
,
but
with
an
older
figure
in
its
robustness
and
its
breadth
of
shoulder
<EOS>
;
say
a
man
of
eight
-
and
-
twenty
,
or
at
the
utmost
thirty
;
so
extremely
sunburnt
that
the
contrast
between
his
brown
visage
and
the
white
forehead
shaded
out
of
doors
by
his
hat
,
and
the
glimpses
of
white
throat
below
the
neckerchief
,
would
have
been
almost
ludicrous
but
for
his
broad
temples
,
bright
blue
eyes
,
clustering
brown
hair
,
and
laughing
teeth
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
noticed
,
"
said
he
;
"
---
my
name
is
Tartar
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
inclined
his
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
noticed
(
excuse
me
)
that
you
shut
yourself
up
a
good
deal
,
and
that
you
seem
to
like
my
garden
aloft
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
would
like
a
little
more
of
it
,
I
could
throw
out
a
few
lines
and
stays
between
my
windows
and
yours
,
which
the
runners
would
take
to
directly
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
have
some
boxes
,
both
of
mignonette
and
wall
-
flower
,
that
I
could
shove
on
along
the
gutter
(
with
a
boathook
I
have
by
me
)
to
your
windows
,
and
draw
back
again
when
they
wanted
watering
or
gardening
,
and
shove
on
again
when
they
were
ship
-
shape
;
so
that
they
would
cause
you
no
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
take
this
liberty
without
asking
your
permission
,
so
<EOS>
I
venture
to
ask
it
.
 
<EOS>
Tartar
,
corresponding
set
,
next
door
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
kind
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
I
ought
to
apologise
for
looking
in
so
late
.
 
<EOS>
But
having
noticed
(
excuse
me
)
that
you
generally
walk
out
at
night
,
I
thought
I
should
inconvenience
you
least
by
awaiting
your
return
.
<EOS>
I
am
always
afraid
of
inconveniencing
busy
men
,
being
an
idle
man
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
have
thought
so
,
from
your
appearance
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
?
 
<EOS>
I
take
it
as
a
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
I
was
bred
in
the
Royal
Navy
,
and
was
First
Lieutenant
when
I
quitted
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
an
uncle
disappointed
in
the
service
leaving
me
his
property
on
condition
that
I
left
the
Navy
,
I
accepted
the
fortune
,
and
resigned
my
commission
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lately
,
I
presume
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
had
had
twelve
or
fifteen
years
of
knocking
about
first
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
some
nine
months
before
you
;
I
had
had
one
crop
before
you
came
.
 
<EOS>
I
chose
this
place
,
because
,
having
served
last
in
a
little
corvette
,
I
knew
I
should
feel
more
at
home
where
I
had
a
constant
opportunity
of
knocking
my
head
against
the
ceiling
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
would
never
do
for
a
man
who
had
been
aboard
ship
from
his
boyhood
to
turn
luxurious
all
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
,
again
;
having
been
accustomed
to
a
very
short
allowance
of
land
all
my
life
,
I
thought
I
'd
feel
my
way
to
the
command
of
a
landed
estate
,
by
beginning
in
boxes
.
"
   
<EOS>
Whimsically
as
this
was
said
,
there
was
a
touch
of
merry
earnestness
in
it
that
made
it
doubly
whimsical
.
   
<EOS>
"
However
,
"
said
the
Lieutenant
,
"
I
have
talked
quite
enough
about
myself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
way
,
I
hope
;
it
has
merely
been
to
present
myself
to
you
naturally
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
liberty
I
have
described
,
it
will
be
a
charity
,
for
it
will
give
me
something
more
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
are
not
to
suppose
that
it
will
entail
any
interruption
or
intrusion
on
you
,
for
that
is
far
from
my
intention
.
"
   
<EOS>
Neville
replied
that
he
was
greatly
obliged
,
and
that
he
thankfully
accepted
the
kind
proposal
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
glad
to
take
your
windows
in
tow
,
"
said
the
Lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
what
I
have
seen
of
you
when
I
have
been
gardening
at
mine
,
and
you
have
been
looking
on
,
I
have
thought
you
(
excuse
me
)
rather
too
studious
and
delicate
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
ask
,
is
your
health
at
all
affected
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
undergone
some
mental
distress
,
"
said
Neville
,
confused
,
"
which
has
stood
me
in
the
stead
of
illness
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
"
said
Mr
Tartar
.
   
<EOS>
With
the
greatest
delicacy
he
shifted
his
ground
to
the
windows
again
,
and
asked
if
he
could
look
at
one
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
On
Neville
's
opening
it
,
he
immediately
sprang
out
,
as
if
he
were
going
aloft
with
a
whole
watch
in
an
emergency
,
and
were
setting
a
bright
example
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
"
cried
Neville
,
"
do
n't
do
that
!
 
<EOS>
Where
are
you
going
Mr
Tartar
?
 
<EOS>
You
'll
be
dashed
to
pieces
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
well
!
"
said
the
Lieutenant
,
coolly
looking
about
him
on
the
housetop
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
taut
and
trim
here
.
 
<EOS>
Those
lines
and
stays
shall
be
rigged
before
you
turn
out
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
May
I
take
this
short
cut
home
,
and
say
good
-
night
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tartar
!
"
urged
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
!
 
<EOS>
It
makes
me
giddy
to
see
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tartar
,
with
a
wave
of
his
hand
and
the
deftness
of
a
cat
,
had
already
dipped
through
his
scuttle
of
scarlet
runners
without
breaking
a
leaf
,
and
"
gone
below
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
his
bedroom
window
-
blind
held
aside
with
his
hand
,
happened
at
the
moment
to
have
Neville
's
chambers
under
his
eye
for
the
last
time
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
Fortunately
his
eye
was
on
the
front
of
the
house
and
not
the
back
,
or
this
remarkable
appearance
and
disappearance
might
have
broken
his
rest
as
a
phenomenon
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Grewgious
seeing
nothing
there
,
not
even
a
light
in
the
windows
,
his
gaze
wandered
from
the
windows
to
the
stars
,
as
if
he
would
have
read
in
them
something
that
was
hidden
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
us
would
,
if
we
could
;
but
none
of
us
so
much
as
know
our
letters
in
the
stars
yet
---
or
seem
likely
to
do
it
,
in
this
state
of
existence
---
and
few
languages
can
be
read
until
their
alphabets
are
mastered
.
    
Chapter
18
.
<EOS>
A
settler
in
Cloisterham
 
<EOS>
At
about
this
time
a
stranger
appeared
in
Cloisterham
;
a
white
-
haired
personage
,
with
black
eyebrows
.
 
<EOS>
Being
buttoned
up
in
a
tightish
blue
surtout
,
with
a
buff
waistcoat
and
gray
trousers
,
he
had
something
of
a
military
air
,
but
he
announced
himself
at
the
Crozier
(
the
orthodox
hotel
,
where
he
put
up
with
a
portmanteau
)
as
an
idle
dog
who
lived
upon
his
means
;
and
he
farther
announced
that
he
had
a
mind
to
take
a
lodging
in
the
picturesque
old
city
for
a
month
or
two
,
with
a
view
of
settling
down
there
altogether
.
 
<EOS>
Both
announcements
were
made
in
the
coffee
-
room
of
the
Crozier
,
to
all
whom
it
might
or
might
not
concern
,
by
the
stranger
as
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
empty
fireplace
,
waiting
for
his
fried
sole
,
veal
cutlet
,
and
pint
of
sherry
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
waiter
(
business
being
chronically
slack
at
the
Crozier
)
represented
all
whom
it
might
or
might
not
concern
,
and
absorbed
the
whole
of
the
information
.
   
<EOS>
This
gentleman
's
white
head
was
unusually
large
,
and
his
shock
of
white
hair
was
unusually
thick
and
ample
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
waiter
,
"
he
said
,
shaking
his
shock
of
hair
,
as
a
Newfoundland
dog
might
shake
his
before
sitting
down
to
dinner
,
"
that
a
fair
lodging
for
a
single
buffer
might
be
found
in
these
parts
,
eh
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
had
no
doubt
of
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Something
old
,
"
said
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
"
Take
my
hat
down
for
a
moment
from
that
peg
,
will
you
?
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
want
it
;
look
into
it
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
see
written
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
read
:
 
"
Datchery
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
know
my
name
,
"
said
the
gentleman
;
"
Dick
Datchery
.
 
<EOS>
Hang
it
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
saying
something
old
is
what
I
should
prefer
,
something
odd
and
out
of
the
way
;
something
venerable
,
architectural
,
and
inconvenient
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
good
choice
of
inconvenient
lodgings
in
the
town
,
sir
,
I
think
,
"
replied
the
waiter
,
with
modest
confidence
in
its
resources
that
way
;
"
indeed
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
we
could
suit
you
that
far
,
however
particular
you
might
be
.
 
<EOS>
But
a
architectural
lodging
!
"
<EOS>
That
seemed
to
trouble
the
waiter
's
head
,
and
he
shook
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anything
Cathedraly
,
now
,
"
Mr
Datchery
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Tope
,
"
said
the
waiter
,
brightening
,
as
he
rubbed
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
"
would
be
the
likeliest
party
to
inform
in
that
line
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
is
Mr
Tope
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Dick
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
The
waiter
explained
that
he
was
the
Verger
,
and
that
Mrs
Tope
had
indeed
once
upon
a
time
let
lodgings
herself
or
offered
to
let
them
;
but
that
as
nobody
had
ever
taken
them
,
Mrs
Tope
's
window
-
bill
,
long
a
Cloisterham
Institution
,
had
disappeared
;
probably
had
tumbled
down
one
day
,
and
never
been
put
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
call
on
Mrs
Tope
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
"
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
So
when
he
had
done
his
dinner
,
he
was
duly
directed
to
the
spot
,
and
sallied
out
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Crozier
being
an
hotel
of
a
most
retiring
disposition
,
and
the
waiter
's
directions
being
fatally
precise
,
he
soon
became
bewildered
,
and
went
boggling
about
and
about
the
Cathedral
Tower
,
whenever
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
it
,
with
a
general
impression
on
his
mind
that
Mrs
Tope
's
was
somewhere
very
near
it
,
and
that
,
like
the
children
in
the
game
of
hot
boiled
beans
and
very
good
butter
,
he
was
warm
in
his
search
when
he
saw
the
Tower
,
and
cold
when
he
did
n't
see
it
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
getting
very
cold
indeed
when
he
came
upon
a
fragment
of
burial
-
ground
in
which
an
unhappy
sheep
was
grazing
.
 
<EOS>
Unhappy
,
because
a
hideous
small
boy
was
stoning
it
through
the
railings
,
and
had
already
lamed
it
in
one
leg
,
and
was
much
excited
by
the
benevolent
sportsmanlike
purpose
of
breaking
its
other
three
legs
,
and
bringing
it
down
.
   
<EOS>
"
'
It
'
i
m
agin
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
boy
,
as
the
poor
creature
leaped
;
"
and
made
a
dint
in
his
wool
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
!
"
said
Mr
Datchery
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
see
you
have
lamed
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yer

"
returned
the
sportsman
.
 
<EOS>
"

Come

<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
"
Stay

and

"
   
<EOS>
"
Ow

I

and

which

Topeseses
,
when
Topeseses

t'other

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
on

then
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
brisk
dialogue
concluded
,
the
boy
led
the
way
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
stopped
at
some
distance
from
an
arched
passage
,
pointing
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lookie

<EOS>
"
Indeed

"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
with
a
second
look
of
some
interest
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes

;
t'other

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
little
way
in

<EOS>
"
Good

"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
producing
a
shilling
.
 
<EOS>
"
You

"
   
<EOS>

"
I
tell

you

because
I

<EOS>
So
the

<EOS>

Deputy

"
   
<EOS>
The
boy
instantly
darted
off
with
the
shilling
,
lest
Mr
Datchery
should
repent
,
but
stopped
at
a
safe
distance
,
on
the
happy
chance
of
his
being
uneasy
in
his
mind
about
it
,
to
goad
him
with
a
demon
dance
expressive
of
its
irrevocability
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
,
taking
off
his
hat
to
give
that
shock
of
white
hair
of
his
another
shake
,
seemed
quite
resigned
,
and
betook
himself
whither
he
had
been
directed
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tope
's
official
dwelling
,
communicating
by
an
upper
stair
with
Mr
Jasper
's
(
hence
Mrs
Tope
's
attendance
on
that
gentleman
)
,
was
of
very
modest
proportions
,
and
partook
of
the
character
of
a
cool
dungeon
.
 
<EOS>
Its
ancient
walls
were
massive
,
and
its
rooms
rather
seemed
to
have
been
dug
out
of
them
,
than
to
have
been
designed
beforehand
with
any
reference
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
main
door
opened
at
once
on
a
chamber
of
no
describable
shape
,
with
a
groined
roof
,
which
in
its
turn
opened
on
another
chamber
of
no
describable
shape
,
with
another
groined
roof
:
 
their
windows
small
,
and
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
chambers
,
close
as
to
their
atmosphere
,
and
swarthy
as
to
their
illumination
by
natural
light
,
were
the
apartments
which
Mrs
Tope
had
so
long
offered
to
an
unappreciative
city
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
,
however
,
was
more
appreciative
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
if
he
sat
with
the
main
door
open
he
would
enjoy
the
passing
society
of
all
comers
to
and
fro
by
the
gateway
,
and
would
have
light
enough
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
that
if
Mr
and
Mrs
Tope
,
living
overhead
,
used
for
their
own
egress
and
ingress
a
little
side
stair
that
came
plump
into
the
Precincts
by
a
door
opening
outward
,
to
the
surprise
and
inconvenience
of
a
limited
public
of
pedestrians
in
a
narrow
way
,
he
would
be
alone
,
as
in
a
separate
residence
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
the
rent
moderate
,
and
everything
as
quaintly
inconvenient
as
he
could
desire
.
 
<EOS>
He
agreed
,
therefore
,
to
take
the
lodging
then
and
there
,
and
money
down
,
possession
to
be
had
next
evening
,
<EOS>
on
condition
that
reference
was
permitted
him
to
Mr
Jasper
as
occupying
the
gatehouse
,
of
which
on
the
other
side
of
the
gateway
,
the
Verger
's
hole
-
in
-
the
-
wall
was
an
appanage
or
subsidiary
part
.
   
<EOS>
The
poor
dear
gentleman
was
very
solitary
and
very
sad
,
Mrs
Tope
said
,
but
she
had
no
doubt
he
would
"
speak
for
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
Mr
Datchery
had
heard
something
of
what
had
occurred
there
last
winter
?
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
had
as
confused
a
knowledge
of
the
event
in
question
,
on
trying
to
recall
it
,
as
he
well
could
have
.
 
<EOS>
He
begged
Mrs
Tope
's
pardon
when
she
found
it
incumbent
on
her
to
correct
him
in
every
detail
of
his
summary
of
the
facts
,
but
pleaded
that
he
was
merely
a
single
buffer
getting
through
life
upon
his
means
as
idly
as
he
could
,
and
that
so
many
people
were
so
constantly
making
away
with
so
many
other
people
,
as
to
render
it
difficult
for
a
buffer
of
an
easy
temper
to
preserve
the
circumstances
of
the
several
cases
unmixed
in
his
mind
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
proving
willing
to
speak
for
Mrs
Tope
,
Mr
Datchery
,
who
had
sent
up
his
card
,
was
invited
to
ascend
the
postern
staircase
.
 
<EOS>
The
Mayor
was
there
,
Mr
Tope
said
;
but
he
was
not
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
company
,
as
he
and
Mr
Jasper
were
great
friends
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
beg
pardon
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
making
a
leg
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
as
he
addressed
himself
equally
to
both
gentlemen
;
"
a
selfish
precaution
on
my
part
,
and
not
personally
interesting
to
anybody
but
myself
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
a
buffer
living
on
his
means
,
and
having
an
idea
of
doing
it
in
this
lovely
place
in
peace
and
quiet
,
for
remaining
span
of
life
,
I
beg
to
ask
if
the
Tope
family
are
quite
respectable
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Jasper
could
answer
for
that
without
the
slightest
hesitation
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
enough
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
friend
the
Mayor
,
"
added
Mr
Jasper
,
presenting
Mr
Datchery
with
a
courtly
motion
of
his
hand
towards
that
potentate
;
"
whose
recommendation
is
actually
much
more
important
to
a
stranger
than
that
of
an
obscure
person
like
myself
,
will
testify
in
their
behalf
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Worshipful
the
Mayor
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
with
a
low
bow
,
"
places
me
under
an
infinite
obligation
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
good
people
,
sir
,
Mr

Mrs
Tope

said
Mr

with
condescension

<EOS>
"
Very
good

<EOS>
Very

<EOS>
Very

<EOS>
Much
approved

Chapter

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
Worshipful
the
Mayor
gives
them
a
character
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
"
of
which
they
may
indeed
be
proud
.
 
<EOS>
I
would
ask
His
Honour
(
if
I
might
be
permitted
)
whether
there
are
not
many
objects
of
great
interest
in
the
city
which
is
under
his
beneficent
sway
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Sapsea
,
"
an
ancient
city
,
and
an
ecclesiastical
city
.
 
<EOS>
We
are
a
constitutional
city
,
as
it
becomes
such
a
city
to
be
,
and
we
uphold
and
maintain
our
glorious
privileges
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
Honour
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
bowing
,
"
inspires
me
with
a
desire
to
know
more
of
the
city
,
and
confirms
me
in
my
inclination
to
end
my
days
in
the
city
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Retired
from
the
Army

sir

"
suggested
Mr
Sapsea
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
Honour
the
Mayor
does
me
too
much
credit

"
returned
Mr
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
"
Navy

sir

"
suggested
Mr
Sapsea
.
   
<EOS>
"
Again

repeated
Mr
Datchery
,
"
His
Honour
the
Mayor
does
me
too
much
credit

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Diplomacy
is
a
fine
profession
,
"
said
Mr
Sapsea
,
as
a
general
remark
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
,
I
confess
,
His
Honour
the
Mayor
is
too
many
for
me
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
with
an
ingenious
smile
and
bow
;
"
even
a
diplomatic
bird
must
fall
to
such
a
gun
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Now
this
was
very
soothing
.
 
<EOS>
Here
was
a
gentleman
of
a
great
,
not
to
say
a
grand
,
address
,
accustomed
to
rank
and
dignity
,
really
setting
a
fine
example
how
to
behave
to
a
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
that
third
-
person
style
of
being
spoken
to
,
that
Mr
Sapsea
found
particularly
recognisant
of
his
merits
and
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
crave
pardon

said
Mr
Datchery

<EOS>
"
His
Honour
the
Mayor
will
bear
with

forgotten

I
am
returning
home
,
and
if
you
would
like
to
take
the
exterior
of
our

your

I

be

point
it
out

His
Honour
the
Mayor
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
"
is
more
than
kind
and
gracious
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Datchery
,
when
he
had
made
his
acknowledgments
to
Mr
Jasper
,
could
not
be
induced
to
go
out
of
the
room
before
the
Worshipful
,
the
Worshipful
led
the
way
down
-
stairs
;
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
following
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
and
his
shock
of
white
hair
streaming
in
the
evening
breeze
.
   
<EOS>
"
Might
I
ask
His
Honour
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
"
whether
that
gentleman
we
have
just
left
is
the
gentleman
of
whom
I
have
heard
in
the
neighbourhood
as
being
much
afflicted
by
the
loss
of
a
nephew
,
and
concentrating
his
life
on
avenging
the
loss
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
is
the
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
John
Jasper
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
His
Honour
allow
me
to
inquire
whether
there
are
strong
suspicions
of
any
one
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
More
than
suspicions
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Sapsea
;
"
all
but
certainties
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Only
think
now
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
proof
,
sir
,
proof
must
be
built
up
stone
by
stone
,
"
said
the
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
I
say
,
the
end
crowns
the
work
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
enough
that
justice
should
be
morally
certain
;
she
must
be
immorally
certain
---
legally
,
that
is
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
Honour
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
,
"
reminds
me
of
the
nature
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
Immoral
.
 
<EOS>
How
true
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
say
,
sir
,
"
pompously
went
on
the
Mayor
,
"
the
arm
of
the
law
is
a
strong
arm
,
and
a
long
arm
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
the
may
I
put
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
strong
arm

a
long
arm

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
How
forcible
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
And
yet
,
again
,
how
true
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
Mr
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
without
betraying
,
what
I
call
the
secrets
of
the
prison

house
,
"
said
Mr
Sapsea
;
"
the
secrets

the
prison

house
is
the
term
I
used
on

bench

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
other
term
than
His
Honour
's
would
express
it
?
"
said
Mr
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Without
,
I
say
,
betraying
them
,
I
predict
to
you
,
knowing
the
iron
will
of
the
gentleman
we
have
just
left
<EOS>
(
I
take
the
bold
step
of
calling
it
iron
,
on
account
of
its
strength
)
,
that
in
this
case
the
long
arm
will
reach
,
and
the
strong
arm
will
strike
.
<EOS>
---
This
is
our
Cathedral
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
judges
are
pleased
to
admire
it
,
and
the
best
among
our
townsmen
own
to
being
a
little
vain
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
All
this
time
Mr
Datchery
had
walked
with
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
and
his
white
hair
streaming
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
an
odd
momentary
appearance
upon
him
of
having
forgotten
his
hat
,
when
Mr
Sapsea
now
touched
it
;
and
he
clapped
his
hand
up
to
his
head
as
if
with
some
vague
expectation
of
finding
another
hat
upon
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Pray
be
covered
,
sir
,
"
entreated
Mr
Sapsea
;
<EOS>
magnificently
plying
:
"
<EOS>
I
shall
not
mind
it
,
I
assure
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
Honour
is
very
good
,
but
I
do
it
for
coolness
,
"
said
Mr
Datchery
.
   
<EOS>
Then
Mr
Datchery
admired
the
Cathedral
,
and
Mr
Sapsea
pointed
it
out
as
if
he
himself
had
invented
and
built
it
:
 
there
were
a
few
details
indeed
of
which
he
did
not
approve
,
but
those
he
glossed
over
,
as
if
the
workmen
had
made
mistakes
in
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cathedral
disposed
of
,
he
led
the
way
by
the
churchyard
,
and
stopped
to
extol
the
beauty
of
the
evening
---
by
chance
---
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
Mrs
Sapsea
's
epitaph
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
by
the
by
,
"
said
Mr
Sapsea
,
appearing
to
descend
from
an
elevation
to
remember
it
all
of
a
sudden
;
like
Apollo
shooting
down
from
Olympus
to
pick
up
his
forgotten
lyre
;
"
THAT
is
one
of
our
small
lions
.
 
<EOS>
The
partiality
of
our
people
has
made
it
so
,
and
strangers
have
been
seen
taking
a
copy
of
it
now
and
then
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
judge
of
it
myself
,
for
it
is
a
little
work
of
my
own
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
troublesome
to
turn
,
sir
;
I
may
say
,
difficult
to
turn
with
elegance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
became
so
ecstatic
over
Mr
Sapsea
's
composition
,
that
,
in
spite
of
his
intention
to
end
his
days
in
Cloisterham
,
and
therefore
his
probably
having
in
reserve
many
opportunities
of
copying
it
,
he
would
have
transcribed
it
into
his
pocket
-
book
on
the
spot
,
but
for
the
slouching
towards
them
of
its
material
producer
and
perpetuator
,
Durdles
,
whom
Mr
Sapsea
hailed
,
not
sorry
to
show
him
a
bright
example
of
behaviour
to
superiors
.
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
Durdles
!
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
mason
,
sir

one
of
our
Cloisterham
worthies

everybody
here

Durdles

<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
do
it
if
I

him

"
growled
Durdles
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
're
a

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
surely
do
n't

returned
Mr

,
"
any
more
than
for
His
Honour

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
's
His

"
demanded
Durdles
.
   
<EOS>
"
His
Honour
the
Mayor
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
never
was
brought
afore
him
,
"
said
Durdles
,
with
anything
but
the
look
of
a
loyal
subject
of
the
mayoralty
,
"
and
it
'll
be
time
enough
for
me
to
Honour
him
when
I
am

<EOS>
Until

"
<EOS>
"
   
Here
,
Deputy
(
preceded
by
a
flying
oyster
-
shell
)
appeared
upon
the
scene
,
and
requested
to
have
the
sum
of
threepence
instantly
"
chucked
"
to
him
by
Mr
Durdles
,
whom
he
had
been
vainly
seeking
up
and
down
,
as
lawful
wages
overdue
.
 
<EOS>
While
that
gentleman
,
with
his
bundle
under
his
arm
,
slowly
found
and
counted
out
the
money
,
Mr
Sapsea
informed
the
new
settler
of
Durdles
's
habits
,
pursuits
,
abode
,
and
reputation
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
suppose

stranger
might
come
to
see
you

your
works
,
Mr
Durdles

at
any
odd
time

said
Mr
Datchery
upon
that
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Any

welcome

come

returned
Durdles
,
with
a
penny
between
his
teeth
and
certain
halfpence
in
his
hands
;
"
or
if
he
likes
to
make
it
twice

'll
be
doubly

"
   
<EOS>
Deputy
,
with
a
piercing
broadside
of
whistle
through
the
whole
gap
in
his
mouth
,
as
a

<EOS>
The
Worshipful

the
Worshipper
then
passed
on
together
until
they
parted
,
with
many
ceremonies
,
at
the
Worshipful
's
door
;
even
then
the
Worshipper
carried
his
hat
under
his
arm
,
and
gave
his
streaming
white
hair
to
the
breeze

Said
Mr
Datchery
to
himself
that
night

looked
at

white
hair
in
the
gas

lighted
looking

glass
over
the

out

Cloisterham
is
so
bright

sunny
in
these
summer
days

that
the
Cathedral
and
the
monastery
-
ruin
show
as
if
their
strong
walls
were
transparent

A
soft
glow
seems
to
shine
from
within
them

rather
than
upon
them
from
without

such
is
their
mellowness
as
they
look
forth
on
the
hot
corn

fields
and
the
smoking
roads
that
distantly
wind
among
them

The
Cloisterham

blush
with

<EOS>
Time
was
when
travel
-
stained
pilgrims
rode
in
clattering
parties
through
the
city
's
welcome
shades
;
time
is
when
wayfarers
,
leading
a
gipsy
life
between
haymaking
time
and
harvest
,
and
looking
as
if
they
were
just
made
of
the
dust
of
the
earth
,
<EOS>
so
very
dusty
are
they
,
lounge
about
on
cool
door

steps
,
trying
to
mend
their
unmendable
shoes
,
or
giving
them
to
the
city
kennels
as
a
hopeless
job
,
and
seeking
others
in
the
bundles
that
they
carry
,
along
with
their
yet
unused
sickles
swathed
in
bands
of
straw
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
the
more
public
pumps
there
is
much
cooling
of
bare
feet
,
together
with
much
bubbling
and
gurgling
of
drinking
with
hand
to
spout
on
the
part
of
these
Bedouins
;
the
Cloisterham
police
meanwhile
looking
askant
from
their
beats
with
suspicion
,
and
manifest
impatience
that
the
intruders
should
depart
from
within
the
civic
bounds
,
and
once
more
fry
themselves
on
the
simmering
high

On
the
afternoon
of
such
a
day
,
when
the
last
Cathedral
service
is
done
,
and
when
that
side
of
the
High

on
which
the
Nuns

stands
is
in
grateful
shade
,
save
where
its
quaint
old
garden
opens
to
the
west
between
the
boughs

trees
,
a
servant
informs
Rosa
,
to
her
terror
,
that
Mr

desires
to
see

If
he
had
chosen
his

for
finding
her

he
could
have
done
no
better

Perhaps
he
has
chosen
it

Helena

Miss

cried

helplessly

The

replies
,
that
Mr

never
asked
the
question
.
   
<EOS>
That
he
said
he
knew
she
was
at

and
begged
she
might
be
told
that
he
asked
to
see
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
What

I
do

<EOS>
what
shall
I
do

"
<EOS>
thinks
Rosa
,
clasping
her
hands
.
   
<EOS>
Possessed
by
a
kind
of
desperation
,
she
adds
in
the
next
breath
,
that
she
will
come
to
Mr
Jasper
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
She
shudders
at
the
thought
of
being
shut
up
with
him
in
the
house
;
but
many
of
its
windows
command
the
garden
,
and
she
can
be
seen
as
well
as
heard
there
,
and
can
shriek
in
the
free
air
and
run
away
.
 
<EOS>
Such
is
the
wild
idea
that
flutters
through
her
mind
.
   
<EOS>
She
has
never
seen
him
since
the
fatal
night
,
except
when
she
was
questioned
before
the
Mayor
,
and
then
he
was
present
in
gloomy
watchfulness
,
as
representing
his
lost
nephew
and
burning
to
avenge
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
hangs
her
garden
-
hat
on
her
arm
,
and
goes
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
she
sees
him
from
the
porch
,
leaning
on
the
sun
-
dial
,
the
old
horrible
feeling
of
being
compelled
by
him
,
asserts
its
hold
upon
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
feels
that
she
would
even
then
go
back
,
but
that
he
draws
her
feet
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
not
resist
,
and
sits
down
,
with
her
head
bent
,
on
the
garden
-
seat
beside
the
sun
-
dial
.
 
<EOS>
She
can
not
look
up
at
him
for
abhorrence
,
but
she
has
perceived
that
he
is
dressed
in
deep
mourning
.
 
<EOS>
So
is
she
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
at
first
;
but
the
lost
has
long
been
given
up
,
and
mourned
for
,
as
dead
.
   
<EOS>
He
would
begin
by
touching
her
hand
.
 
<EOS>
She
feels
the
intention
,
and
draws
her
hand
back
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
are
then
fixed
upon
her
,
she
knows
,
though
her
own
see
nothing
but
the
grass
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
waiting
,
"
he
begins
,
"
for
some
time
,
to
be
summoned
back
to
my
duty
near
you

<EOS>
After
several
times
forming
her
lips
,
which
she
knows
he
is
closely
watching
,
into
the
shape
of
some
other
hesitating
reply
,
and
then
into
none
,
she
answers
:
 
"
Duty
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
The
duty
of
teaching
you

serving
you
as
your

master

I
have
left

Not
left

Discontinued

discontinued
it
under
the
shock
that
we
have
all
felt
so
acutely
.
 
<EOS>
When
will
you
resume
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
?
 
<EOS>
You
could
have
done
no
more
if
you
had
loved
my
dear
boy
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
love
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosa
,
with
a
flash
of
anger
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
not
quite
---
not
quite
in
the
right
way
<EOS>
,
shall
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
Not
in
the
intended
and
expected
way
.
 
<EOS>
Much
as
my
dear
boy
was
,
unhappily
,
too
self
-
conscious
and
self
-
satisfied
<EOS>
(
I
'll
draw
no
parallel
between
him
and
you
in
that
respect
)
to
love
as
he
should
have
loved
,
or
as
any
one
in
his
place
would
have
loved
---
must
have
loved
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
sits
in
the
same
still
attitude
,
but
shrinking
a
little
more
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Then
,
to
be
told
that
you
discontinued
your
study
with
me
,
was
to
be
politely
told
that
you
abandoned
it
altogether
?
<EOS>
"
he
suggested
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
says
Rosa
,
with
sudden
spirit
,
"
The
politeness
was
my
guardian
's
,
not
mine
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
him
that
I
was
resolved
to
leave
off
,
and
that
I
was
determined
to
stand
by
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
you
still
are
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
still
am
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
beg
not
to
be
questioned
any
more
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
will
not
answer
any
more
;
I
have
that
in
my
power
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
is
so
conscious
of
his
looking
at
her
with
a
gloating
admiration
of
the
touch
of
anger
on
her
,
and
the
fire
and
animation
it
brings
with
it
,
that
even
as
her
spirit
rises
,
it
falls
again
,
and
she
struggles
with
a
sense
of
shame
,
affront
,
and
fear
,
much
as
she
did
that
night
at
the
piano
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
question
you
any
more
,
since
you
object
to
it
so
much
;
I
will
confess
---
<EOS>
"
   
"
I
do
not
wish
to
hear
you
,
sir
,
"
cries
Rosa
,
rising
.
   
<EOS>
This
time
he
does
touch
her
with
his
outstretched
hand
.
 
<EOS>
In
shrinking
from
it
,
she
shrinks
into
her
seat
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
must
sometimes
act
in
opposition
to
our
wishes
,
"
he
tells
her
in
a
low
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
must
do
so
now
,
or
do
more
harm
to
others
than
you
can
ever
set
right
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
harm
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Presently
,
presently
.
 
<EOS>
You
question
ME
,
you
see
,
and
surely
that
's
not
fair
when
you
forbid
me
to
question
you
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
will
answer
the
question
presently
.
 
<EOS>
Dearest
Rosa
!
<EOS>
Charming
Rosa
!
"
   
<EOS>
She
starts
up
again
.
   
<EOS>
This
time
he
does
not
touch
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
face
looks
so
wicked
and
menacing
,
as
he
stands
leaning
against
the
sun
-
dial
-
setting
,
as
it
were
,
his
black
mark
upon
the
very
face
of
day
---
that
her
flight
is
arrested
by
horror
as
she
looks
at
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
forget
how
many
windows
command
a
view
of
us
,
"
he
says
,
glancing
towards
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
touch
you
again
;
I
will
come
no
nearer
to
you
than
I
am
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
and
there
will
be
no
mighty
wonder
in
your
music
-
master
's
leaning
idly
against
a
pedestal
and
speaking
with
you
,
remembering
all
that
has
happened
,
and
our
shares
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
my
beloved
.
"
   
<EOS>
She
would
have
gone
once
more
---
was
all
but
gone
---
and
once
more
his
face
,
darkly
threatening
what
would
follow
if
she
went
,
has
stopped
her
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
at
him
with
the
expression
of
the
instant
frozen
on
her
face
,
she
sits
down
on
the
seat
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Rosa
,
even
when
my
dear
boy
was
affianced
to
you
<EOS>
,
I
loved
you
madly
;
even
when
I
thought
his
happiness
in
having
you
for
his
wife
was
certain
,
I
loved
you
madly
;
even
when
I
strove
to
make
him
more
ardently
devoted
to
you
,
I
loved
you
madly
;
even
when
he
gave
me
the
picture
of
your
lovely
face
so
carelessly
traduced
by
him
,
which
I
feigned
to
hang
always
in
my
sight
for
his
sake
,
but
worshipped
in
torment
for
years
<EOS>
,
I
loved
you
madly
;
in
the
distasteful
work
of
the
day
,
in
the
wakeful
misery
of
the
night
,
girded
by
sordid
realities
,
or
wandering
through
Paradises
and
Hells
of
visions
into
which
I
rushed
,
carrying
your
image
in
my
arms
,
I
loved
you
madly
.
"
   
<EOS>
If
anything
could
make
his
words
more
hideous
to
her
than
they
are
in
themselves
,
it
would
be
the
contrast
between
the
violence
of
his
look
and
delivery
,
and
the
composure
of
his
assumed
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
endured
it
all
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
So
long
as
you
were
his
,
or
so
long
as
I
supposed
you
to
be
his
,
I
hid
my
secret
loyally
.
 
<EOS>
Did
I
not
?
"
   
<EOS>
This
lie
,
so
gross
,
while
the
mere
words
in
which
it
is
told
are
so
true
,
is
more
than
Rosa
can
endure
.
 
<EOS>
She
answers
with
kindling
indignation
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
were
as
false
throughout
,
sir
,
as
you
are
now
.
<EOS>
You
were
false
to
him
,
daily
and
hourly
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
made
my
life
unhappy
by
your
pursuit
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
that
you
made
me
afraid
to
open
his
generous
eyes
,
and
that
you
forced
me
,
for
his
own
trusting
,
good
,
good
sake
,
to
keep
the
truth
from
him
,
that
you
were
a
bad
,
bad
man
!
"
   
<EOS>
His
preservation
of
his
easy
attitude
rendering
his
working
features
and
his
convulsive
hands
absolutely
diabolical
,
he
returns
,
with
a
fierce
extreme
of
admiration
:
   
<EOS>
"
How
beautiful
you
are
!
 
<EOS>
You
are
more
beautiful
in
anger
than
in
repose
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
ask
you
for
your
love
;
give
me
yourself
and
your
hatred
;
give
me
yourself
and
that
pretty
rage
;
give
me
yourself
and
that
enchanting
scorn
;
it
will
be
enough
for
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
Impatient
tears
rise
to
the
eyes
of
the
trembling
little
beauty
,
and
her
face
flames
;
but
as
she
again
rises
to
leave
him
in
indignation
,
and
seek
protection
within
the
house
,
he
stretches
out
his
hand
towards
the
porch
,
as
though
he
invited
her
to
enter
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
,
you
rare
charmer
,
you
sweet
witch
,
that
you
must
stay
and
hear
me
,
or
do
more
harm
than
can
ever
be
undone
.
 
<EOS>
You
asked
me
what
harm
.
 
<EOS>
Stay
,
and
I
will
tell
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
,
and
I
will
do
it
!
"
   
<EOS>
Again
Rosa
quails
before
his
threatening
face
,
though
innocent
of
its
meaning
,
and
she
remains
.
 
<EOS>
Her
panting
breathing
comes
and
goes
as
if
it
would
choke
her
;
but
with
a
repressive
hand
upon
her
bosom
,
she
remains
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
my
confession
that
my
love
is
mad
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
mad
,
that
had
the
ties
between
me
and
my
dear
lost
boy
been
one
silken
thread
less
strong
,
I
might
have
swept
even
him
from
your
side
,
when
you
favoured
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
A
film
come
over
the
eyes
she
raises
for
an
instant
,
as
though
he
had
turned
her
faint
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Even
him
,
"
he
repeats
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
even
him
!
 
<EOS>
Rosa
,
you
see
me
<EOS>
and
you
hear
me
.
 
<EOS>
Judge
for
yourself
whether
any
other
admirer
shall
love
you
and
live
,
whose
life
is
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
show
you
how
mad
my
love
is
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
hawked
through
the
late
inquiries
by
Mr
Crisparkle
,
that
young
Landless
had
confessed
to
him
that
he
was
a
rival
of
my
lost
boy
.
 
<EOS>
That
is
an
inexpiable
offence
in
my
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
Mr
Crisparkle
knows
under
my
hand
that
I
have
devoted
myself
to
the
murderer
's
discovery
and
destruction
,
be
he
whom
he
might
,
and
that
I
determined
to
discuss
the
mystery
with
no
one
until
I
should
hold
the
clue
in
which
to
entangle
the
murderer
as
in
a
net
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
since
worked
patiently
to
wind
and
wind
it
round
him
;
and
it
is
slowly
winding
as
I
speak
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
belief
,
if
you
believe
in
the
criminality
of
Mr
Landless
,
is
not
Mr
Crisparkle
's
belief
,
and
he
is
a
good
man
,
"
Rosa
retorts
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
belief
is
my
own
;
and
I
reserve
it
,
worshipped
of
my
soul
!
<EOS>
Circumstances
may
accumulate
so
strongly
EVEN
AGAINST
AN
INNOCENT
MAN
,
that
directed
,
sharpened
,
and
pointed
,
they
may
slay
him
.
 
<EOS>
One
wanting
link
discovered
by
perseverance
against
a
guilty
man
,
proves
his
guilt
,
however
slight
its
evidence
before
,
and
he
dies
.
<EOS>
Young
Landless
stands
in
deadly
peril
either
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
really
suppose
,
"
Rosa
pleads
with
him
,
turning
paler
,
"
that
I
favour
Mr
Landless
,
or
that
Mr
Landless
has
ever
in
any
way
addressed
himself
to
me
,
you
are
wrong
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
puts
that
from
him
with
a
slighting
action
of
his
hand
and
a
curled
lip
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
show
you
how
madly
I
love
you

<EOS>
More
madly
now

I
am
willing
to
renounce
the
second
object
that
has
arisen
in
my
life

divide
it
with
you

henceforth

no
object

I

he
observes
with
a
smile
,
as
he
folds
his
hands
upon
the
sun
-
dial
and
leans
his
chin
upon
them
,
so
that
his
talk
would
seem
from
the
windows
(
faces
occasionally
come
and
go
there
)
to
be
of
the
airiest
and
playfullest
---
"
I
am
unconsciously
giving
offence
by
questioning
again

I
will
simply
make
statements

therefore
,

not
put
questions

<EOS>
You

good

you
do
care

Then
remove

Stop

<EOS>
Rosa
puts
her
hands
to
her
temples
,
and
,
pushing
back
her
hair
,
looks
wildly
and
abhorrently
at
him
,
as
though
she
were
trying
to
piece
together
what
it
is
his
deep
purpose
to
present
to
her
only
in
fragments
.
   
<EOS>
"
Reckon
up
nothing
at
this
moment

angel

but
the
sacrifices
that
I
lay
at
those
dear
feet
,
which
I
could
fall
down
among
the
vilest
ashes
and
kiss
,
and
put
upon
my
head
as
a
poor
savage
might
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
my
fidelity

my
dear
boy
after
death

Tread
upon
it

<EOS>
With
an
action
of
his
hands

as
though
he
cast
down
something
precious
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
inexpiable
offence

my
adoration

Spurn
it
!

With
a
similar
action

my

<EOS>
The
frightful
vehemence
of
the
man
,
now
reaching
its
full
height
,
so
additionally
terrifies
her
as
to
break
the
spell
that
has
held
her
to
the
spot

She
swiftly
moves
towards

in
an
instant
he
is
at

speaking
in

ear

,
love
you
,
love
you
!
 
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
cast
me
off
now
---
but
you
will
not
---
you
would
never
be
rid
of
me
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
should
come
between
us

<EOS>
I
would
pursue
you
to
the
death

<EOS>
The
handmaid
coming
out
to
open
the
gate
for
him
,
he
quietly
pulls
off
his
hat
as
a
parting
salute
,
and
goes
away
with
no
greater
show
of
agitation
than
is
visible
in
the
effigy
of
Mr
Sapsea

father
opposite

Rosa
faints
in
going
up
-
stairs
,
and
is
carefully
carried
to
her
room
and
laid
down
on
her
bed
.
 
<EOS>
A
thunderstorm
is
coming
on
,
the
maids
say
,
and
the
hot
and
stifling
air
has
overset
the
pretty
dear
:
 
<EOS>
no
wonder
;
they
have
felt
their
own
knees
all
of
a
tremble
all
day
long

Chapter
20
.
<EOS>
A
flight
 
Rosa
no
sooner
came
to
herself
than
the
whole
of
the
late
interview
was
before
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
even
seemed
as
if
it
had
pursued
her
into
her
insensibility
,
and
she
had
not
had
a
moment
's
unconsciousness
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
to
do
,
she
was
at
a
frightened
loss
to
know
:
 
<EOS>
the
only
one
clear
thought
in
her
mind
was
,
that
she
must
fly
from
this
terrible
man
.
   
<EOS>
But
where
could
she
take
refuge
,
and
how
could
she
go
?
 
<EOS>
She
had
never
breathed
her
dread
of
him
to
any
one
but
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
If
she
went
to
Helena
,
and
told
her
what
had
passed
,
that
very
act
might
bring
down
the
irreparable
mischief
that
he
threatened
he
had
the
power
,
and
that
she
knew
he
had
the
will
,
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
more
fearful
he
appeared
to
her
excited
memory
and
imagination
,
the
more
alarming
her
responsibility
appeared
;
seeing
that
a
slight
mistake
on
her
part
,
either
in
action
or
delay
,
might
let
his
malevolence
loose
on
Helena
's
brother
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
's
mind
throughout
the
last
six
months
had
been
stormily
confused
.
 
<EOS>
A
half
-
formed
,
wholly
unexpressed
suspicion
tossed
in
it
,
now
heaving
itself
up
,
and
now
sinking
into
the
deep
;
now
gaining
palpability
,
and
now
losing
it
.
 
<EOS>
Jasper
's
self
-
absorption
in
his
nephew
when
he
was
alive
,
and
his
unceasing
pursuit
of
the
inquiry
how
he
came
by
his
death
,
if
he
were
dead
,
were
themes
so
rife
in
the
place
,
that
no
one
appeared
able
to
suspect
the
possibility
of
foul
play
at
his
hands
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
asked
herself
the
question
,
"
Am
I
so
wicked
in
my
thoughts
as
to
conceive
a
wickedness
that
others
can
not
imagine
?
"
 
<EOS>
Then
she
had
considered
<EOS>
,
Did
the
suspicion
come
of
her
previous
recoiling
from
him
before
the
fact
?
 
<EOS>
And
if
so
,
was
not
that
a
proof
of
its
baselessness
?
<EOS>
Then
she
had
reflected
,
"
What
motive
could
he
have
,
according
to
my
accusation
?
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
ashamed
to
answer
in
her
mind
,
"
The
motive
of
gaining
ME
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
covered
her
face
,
as
if
the
lightest
shadow
of
the
idea
of
founding
murder
on
such
an
idle
vanity
were
a
crime
almost
as
great
.
   
<EOS>
She
ran
over
in
her
mind
again
,
all
that
he
had
said
by
the
sun
-
dial
in
the
garden
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
persisted
in
treating
the
disappearance
as
murder
,
consistently
with
his
whole
public
course
since
the
finding
of
the
watch
and
shirt
-
pin
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
afraid
of
the
crime
being
traced
out
,
would
he
not
rather
encourage
the
idea
of
a
voluntary
disappearance
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
even
declared
that
if
the
ties
between
him
and
his
nephew
had
been
less
strong
,
he
might
have
swept
"
even
him
"
away
from
her
side
.
 
<EOS>
Was
that
like
his
having
really
done
so
?
 
<EOS>
He
had
spoken
of
laying
his
six
months
'
labours
in
the
cause
of
a
just
vengeance
at
her
feet
.
 
<EOS>
Would
he
have
done
that
,
with
that
violence
of
passion
,
if
they
were
a
pretence
?
<EOS>
Would
he
have
ranged
them
with
his
desolate
heart
and
soul
,
his
wasted
life
,
his
peace
and
his
despair
?
 
<EOS>
The
very
first
sacrifice
that
he
represented
himself
as
making
for
her
,
was
his
fidelity
to
his
dear
boy
after
death
.
 
<EOS>
Surely
these
facts
were
strong
against
a
fancy
that
scarcely
dared
to
hint
itself
.
 
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
so
terrible
a
man
!
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
poor
girl
(
for
what
could
she
know
of
the
criminal
intellect
,
which
its
own
professed
students
perpetually
misread
,
because
they
persist
in
trying
to
reconcile
it
with
the
average
intellect
of
average
men
,
instead
of
identifying
it
as
a
horrible
wonder
apart
)
could
get
by
no
road
to
any
other
conclusion
than
that
he
WAS
a
terrible
man
,
and
must
be
fled
from
.
   
<EOS>
She
had
been
Helena
's
stay
and
comfort
during
the
whole
time
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
constantly
assured
her
of
her
full
belief
in
her
brother
's
innocence
,
and
of
her
sympathy
with
him
in
his
misery
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
never
seen
him
since
the
disappearance
,
nor
had
Helena
ever
spoken
one
word
of
his
avowal
to
Mr
Crisparkle
in
regard
of
Rosa
,
<EOS>
though
as
a
part
of
the
interest
of
the
case
it
was
well
known
far
and
wide
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
Helena
's
unfortunate
brother
,
to
her
,
and
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
assurance
she
had
given
her
odious
suitor
was
strictly
true
,
though
it
would
have
been
better
(
she
considered
now
)
if
she
could
have
restrained
herself
from
so
giving
it
.
 
<EOS>
Afraid
of
him
as
the
bright
and
delicate
little
creature
was
,
her
spirit
swelled
at
the
thought
of
his
knowing
it
from
her
own
lips
.
   
<EOS>
But
where
was
she
to
go
?
 
<EOS>
Anywhere
beyond
his
reach
,
was
no
reply
to
the
question
.
 
<EOS>
Somewhere
must
be
thought
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
determined
to
go
to
her
guardian
,
and
to
go
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
The
feeling
she
had
imparted
to
Helena
on
the
night
of
their
first
confidence
,
was
so
strong
upon
her
---
the
feeling
of
not
being
safe
from
him
,
and
of
the
solid
walls
of
the
old
convent
being
powerless
to
keep
out
his
ghostly
following
of
her
---
that
no
reasoning
of
her
own
could
calm
her
terrors
.
 
<EOS>
The
fascination
of
repulsion
had
been
upon
her
so
long
,
and
now
culminated
so
darkly
,
that
she
felt
as
if
he
had
power
to
bind
her
by
a
spell
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
out
at
window
,
even
now
,
as
she
rose
to
dress
,
the
sight
of
the
sun
-
dial
on
which
he
had
leaned
when
he
declared
himself
,
turned
her
cold
,
and
made
her
shrink
from
it
,
as
though
he
had
invested
it
with
some
awful
quality
from
his
own
nature
.
   
<EOS>
She
wrote
a
hurried
note
to
Miss
Twinkleton
,
saying
that
she
had
sudden
reason
for
wishing
to
see
her
guardian
promptly
,
and
had
gone
to
him
;
also
,
entreating
the
good
lady
not
to
be
uneasy
,
for
all
was
well
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
hurried
a
few
quite
useless
articles
into
a
very
little
bag
,
left
the
note
in
a
conspicuous
place
,
and
went
out
,
softly
closing
the
gate
after
her
.
   
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
been
even
in
Cloisterham
High
Street
alone
.
 
<EOS>
But
knowing
all
its
ways
and
windings
very
well
,
she
hurried
straight
to
the
corner
from
which
the
omnibus
departed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
at
that
very
moment
,
going
off
.
   
<EOS>
"
Stop
and
take
me
,
if
you
please
,
Joe
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
go
to
London
.
"
   
<EOS>
In
less
than
another
minute
she
was
on
her
road
to
the
railway
,
under
Joe
's
protection
.
<EOS>
Joe
waited
on
her
when
she
got
there
,
put
her
safely
into
the
railway
carriage
,
and
handed
in
the
very
little
bag
after
her
,
as
though
it
were
some
enormous
trunk
,
hundredweights
heavy
,
which
she
must
on
no
account
endeavour
to
lift
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
you
go
round
when
you
get
back
,
and
tell
Miss
Twinkleton
that
you
saw
me
safely
off
,
Joe
   
"
It
shall
be
done
,
<EOS>
Miss.
"
   
"
<EOS>
With
my
love
,
please
,
Joe
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Miss
---
<EOS>
and
I
would
n't
mind
having
it
myself
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
Joe
did
not
articulate
the
last
clause
;
only
thought
it
.
   
<EOS>
Now
that
she
was
whirling
away
for
London
in
real
earnest
,
Rosa
was
at
leisure
to
resume
the
thoughts
which
her
personal
hurry
had
checked
.
 
<EOS>
The
indignant
thought
that
his
declaration
of
love
soiled
her
;
that
she
could
only
be
cleansed
from
the
stain
of
its
impurity
by
appealing
to
the
honest
and
true
;
supported
her
for
a
time
against
her
fears
,
and
confirmed
her
in
her
hasty
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
But
as
the
evening
grew
darker
and
darker
,
and
the
great
city
impended
nearer
and
nearer
,
the
doubts
usual
in
such
cases
began
to
arise
.
<EOS>
Whether
this
was
not
a
wild
proceeding
,
after
all
;
how
Mr
Grewgious
might
regard
it
;
whether
she
should
find
him
at
the
journey
's
end
;
how
she
would
act
if
he
were
absent
;
what
might
become
of
her
,
alone
,
in
a
place
so
strange
and
crowded
;
how
if
she
had
but
waited
and
taken
counsel
first
;
whether
,
if
she
could
now
go
back
,
she
would
not
do
it
thankfully
;
a
multitude
of
such
uneasy
speculations
disturbed
her
,
more
and
more
as
they
accumulated
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
train
came
into
London
over
the
housetops
;
and
down
below
lay
the
gritty
streets
with
their
yet
un
-
needed
lamps
a
-
glow
,
on
a
hot
,
light
,
summer
night
.
   
<EOS>
"
Hiram
Grewgious
,
Esquire
,
Staple
Inn
,
London
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
all
Rosa
knew
of
her
destination
;
but
it
was
enough
to
send
her
rattling
away
again
in
a
cab
,
through
deserts
of
gritty
streets
,
where
many
people
crowded
at
the
corner
of
courts
and
byways
to
get
some
air
,
and
where
many
other
people
walked
with
a
miserably
monotonous
noise
of
shuffling
of
feet
on
hot
paving
-
stones
,
and
where
all
the
people
and
all
their
surroundings
were
so
gritty
and
so
shabby
!
   
<EOS>
There
was
music
playing
here
and
there
,
but
it
did
not
enliven
the
case
.
 
<EOS>
No
barrel
-
organ
mended
the
matter
,
and
no
big
drum
beat
dull
care
away
.
 
<EOS>
Like
the
chapel
bells
that
were
also
going
here
and
<EOS>
there
,
they
only
seemed
to
evoke
echoes
from
brick
surfaces
,
and
dust
from
everything
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
flat
wind
-
instruments
,
they
seemed
to
have
cracked
their
hearts
and
souls
in
pining
for
the
country
.
   
<EOS>
Her
jingling
conveyance
stopped
at
last
at
a
fast
-
closed
gateway
,
which
appeared
to
belong
to
somebody
who
had
gone
to
bed
very
early
,
and
was
much
afraid
of
housebreakers
;
Rosa
,
discharging
her
conveyance
,
timidly
knocked
at
this
gateway
,
and
was
let
in
,
very
little
bag
and
all
,
by
a
watchman
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Does
Mr
Grewgious
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Grewgious
lives
there
,
Miss
,
"
said
the
watchman
,
pointing
further
in
.
   
<EOS>
So
Rosa
went
further
in
,
and
,
when
the
clocks
were
striking
ten
,
stood
on
P*J*T
's
doorsteps
,
wondering
what
P*J*T
had
done
with
his
street
-
door
.
   
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
painted
name
of
Mr
Grewgious
,
she
went
up
-
stairs
and
softly
tapped
and
tapped
several
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
one
answering
,
and
Mr
Grewgious
's
door
-
handle
yielding
to
her
touch
,
she
went
in
,
and
saw
her
guardian
sitting
on
a
window
-
seat
at
an
open
window
,
with
a
shaded
lamp
placed
far
from
him
on
a
table
in
a
corner
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
drew
nearer
to
him
in
the
twilight
of
the
room
.
 
<EOS>
He
saw
her
,
and
he
said
,
in
an
undertone
:
 
"
Good
Heaven
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
fell
upon
his
neck
,
with
tears
,
and
then
he
said
,
returning
her
embrace
:
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
child
,
my
child
!
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
were
your
mother
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
But
what
,
what
,
what
,
"
he
added
,
soothingly
,
"
has
happened
?
 
<EOS>
My
dear
,
what
has
brought
you
here
?
 
<EOS>
Who
has
brought
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
one
.
 
<EOS>
I
came
alone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
me
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Came
alone
!
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
write
to
me
to
come
and
fetch
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
time
.
 
<EOS>
I
took
a
sudden
resolution
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
,
poor
Eddy
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
fellow
,
poor
fellow
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
His
uncle
has
made
love
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
it
,
"
said
Rosa
,
at
once
with
a
burst
of
tears
,
and
a
stamp
of
her
little
foot
;
"
I
shudder
with
horror
of
him
,
and
I
have
come
to
you
to
protect
me
and
all
of
us
from
him
,
if
you
will
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
,
"
cried
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
a
sudden
rush
of
amazing
energy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Damn
him
!
   
<EOS>
"
Confound
his
politics
!
<EOS>
Frustrate
his
knavish
tricks
!
<EOS>
On
Thee
his
hopes
to
fix
?
<EOS>
Damn
him
again
!
"
<EOS>
"
   
After
this
most
extraordinary
outburst
,
Mr
Grewgious
,
quite
beside
himself
,
plunged
about
the
room
,
to
all
appearance
undecided
whether
he
was
in
a
fit
of
loyal
enthusiasm
,
or
combative
denunciation
.
   
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
said
,
wiping
his
face
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
my
dear
,
but
you
will
be
glad
to
know
I
feel
better
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
no
more
just
now
,
or
I
might
do
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
be
refreshed
and
cheered
.
<EOS>
What
did
you
take
last
?
 
<EOS>
Was
it
breakfast
,
lunch
,
dinner
,
tea
,
or
supper
?
 
<EOS>
And
what
will
you
take
next
?
 
<EOS>
Shall
it
be
breakfast
,
lunch
,
dinner
,
tea
,
or
supper
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
respectful
tenderness
with
which
,
on
one
knee
before
her
,
he
helped
her
to
remove
her
hat
,
and
disentangle
her
pretty
hair
from
it
,
was
quite
a
chivalrous
sight
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
who
,
knowing
him
only
on
the
surface
,
would
have
expected
chivalry
---
<EOS>
and
of
the
true
sort
,
too
;
not
the
spurious
---
from
Mr
Grewgious
?
   
<EOS>
"
Your
rest
too
must
be
provided
for
,
"
he
went
on
;
"
and
you
shall
have
the
prettiest
chamber
in
Furnival
's
.
 
<EOS>
Your
toilet
must
be
provided
for
,
and
you
shall
have
everything
that
an
unlimited
head
chambermaid
---
by
which
expression
<EOS>
I
mean
a
head
chambermaid
not
limited
as
to
outlay
---
can
procure
.
 
<EOS>
Is
that
a
bag
?
"
<EOS>
he
looked
hard
at
it
;
sooth
to
say
,
it
required
hard
looking
at
to
be
seen
at
all
in
a
dimly
lighted
room
:
 
"
and
is
it
your
property
,
my
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
sir
.
 
<EOS>
I
brought
it
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
an
extensive
bag
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
candidly
,
"
though
admirably
calculated
to
contain
a
day
's
provision
for
a
canary
-
bird
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
brought
a
canary
-
bird
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
smiled
and
shook
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
had
,
he
should
have
been
made
welcome
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
and
I
think
he
would
have
been
pleased
to
be
hung
upon
a
nail
outside
and
pit
himself
against
our
Staple
sparrows
;
whose
execution
must
be
admitted
to
be
not
quite
equal
to
their
intention
.
 
<EOS>
Which
is
the
case
with
so
many
of
us
!
 
<EOS>
You
did
n't
say
what
meal
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Have
a
nice
jumble
of
all
meals
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
thanked
him
,
but
said
she
could
only
take
a
cup
of
tea
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
after
several
times
running
out
,
and
in
again
,
to
mention
such
supplementary
items
as
marmalade
,
eggs
,
watercresses
,
salted
fish
,
and
frizzled
ham
,
ran
across
to
Furnival
's
without
his
hat
,
to
give
his
various
directions
.
 
<EOS>
And
soon
afterwards
they
were
realised
in
practice
,
and
the
board
was
spread
.
   
<EOS>
"
Lord
bless
my
soul
,
"
cried
Mr
Grewgious
,
putting
the
lamp
upon
it
,
and
taking
his
seat
opposite
Rosa
;
"
what
a
new
sensation
for
a
poor
old
Angular
bachelor
,
to
be
sure
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
's
expressive
little
eyebrows
asked
him
what
he
meant
?
   
<EOS>
"
The
sensation
of
having
a
sweet
young
presence
in
the
place
,
that
whitewashes
it
,
paints
it
,
papers
it
,
decorates
it
with
gilding
,
and
makes
it
Glorious
!
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
me
!
 
<EOS>
Ah
me
!
"
   
<EOS>
As
there
was
something
mournful
in
his
sigh
,
Rosa
,
in
touching
him
with
her
tea
-
cup
,
ventured
to
touch
him
with
her
small
hand
too
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ahem
!
 
<EOS>
Let
's
talk
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Do
you
always
live
here
,
sir
?
"
asked
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
dear
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
always
alone
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Always
alone
;
except
that
I
have
daily
company
in
a
gentleman
by
the
name
of
Bazzard
,
my
clerk
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
HE
does
n't
live
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
goes
his
way
,
after
office
hours
.
 
<EOS>
In
fact
,
he
is
off
duty
here
,
altogether
,
just
at
present
;
and
a
firm
down
-
stairs
,
with
which
I
have
business
relations
,
lend
me
a
substitute
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
extremely
difficult
to
replace
Mr
Bazzard
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
must
be
very
fond
of
you
,
"
said
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
bears
up
against
it
with
commendable
fortitude
if
he
is
,
"
returned
Mr
Grewgious
,
after
considering
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
I
doubt
if
he
is
.
 
<EOS>
Not
particularly
so
.
 
<EOS>
You
see
,
he
is
discontented
,
poor
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
is
n't
he
contented
?
<EOS>
"
was
the
natural
inquiry
.
   
<EOS>
"
Misplaced
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
great
mystery
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
's
eyebrows
resumed
their
inquisitive
and
perplexed
expression
.
   
<EOS>
"
So
misplaced
,
"
Mr
Grewgious
went
on
,
"
that
I
feel
constantly
apologetic
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
feels
(
though
he
does
n't
mention
it
)
that
I
have
reason
to
be
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
had
by
this
time
grown
so
very
mysterious
,
that
Rosa
did
not
know
how
to
go
on
.
 
<EOS>
While
she
was
thinking
about
it
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
suddenly
jerked
out
of
himself
for
the
second
time
:
   
<EOS>
"
Let
's
talk
.
 
<EOS>
We
were
speaking
of
Mr
Bazzard
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
secret
,
and
moreover
it
is
Mr
Bazzard
's
secret
;
but
the
sweet
presence
at
my
table
makes
me
so
unusually
expansive
,
that
I
feel
I
must
impart
it
in
inviolable
confidence
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
Mr
Bazzard
has
done
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
dear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosa
,
drawing
her
chair
a
little
nearer
,
and
her
mind
reverting
to
Jasper
<EOS>
,
"
nothing
dreadful
,
I
hope
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
He
has
written
a
play
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
in
a
solemn
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
A
tragedy
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
seemed
much
relieved
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
nobody
,
"
pursued
Mr
Grewgious
in
the
same
tone
,
"
will
hear
,
on
any
account
<EOS>
whatever
,
of
bringing
it
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
looked
reflective
,
and
nodded
her
head
slowly
;
as
who
should
say
,
"
Such
things
are
,
and
why
are
they
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
know
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
I
could
n't
write
a
play
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
a
bad
one
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
said
Rosa
,
innocently
,
with
her
eyebrows
again
in
action
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
was
under
sentence
of
decapitation
,
and
was
about
to
be
instantly
decapitated
,
and
an
express
arrived
with
a
pardon
for
the
condemned
convict
Grewgious
if
he
wrote
a
play
,
I
should
be
under
the
necessity
of
resuming
the
block
,
and
begging
the
executioner
to
proceed
to
extremities
,
---
meaning
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
passing
his
hand
under
his
chin
,
"
the
singular
number
,
and
this
extremity
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
appeared
to
consider
what
she
would
do
if
the
awkward
supposititious
case
were
hers
.
   
<EOS>
"
Consequently
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
<EOS>
Mr
Bazzard
would
have
a
sense
of
my
inferiority
to
himself
under
any
circumstances
;
but
when
I
am
his
master
,
you
know
,
the
case
is
greatly
aggravated
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
shook
his
head
seriously
,
as
if
he
felt
the
offence
to
be
a
little
too
much
,
though
of
his
own
committing
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
came
you
to
be
his
master
,
sir
?
"
asked
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
A
question
that
naturally
follows
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
's
talk
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bazzard
's
father
,
being
a
Norfolk
farmer
,
would
have
furiously
laid
about
him
with
a
flail
,
a
pitch
-
fork
,
and
every
agricultural
implement
available
for
assaulting
purposes
,
on
the
slightest
hint
of
his
son
's
having
written
a
play
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
son
,
bringing
to
me
the
father
's
rent
(
which
I
receive
)
,
imparted
his
secret
,
and
pointed
out
that
he
was
determined
to
pursue
his
genius
,
and
that
it
would
put
him
in
peril
of
starvation
,
and
that
he
was
not
formed
for
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
For
pursuing
his
genius
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
for
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
deny
the
position
,
that
Mr
Bazzard
was
not
formed
to
be
starved
,
and
Mr
Bazzard
then
pointed
out
that
it
was
desirable
that
I
should
stand
between
him
and
a
fate
so
perfectly
unsuited
to
his
formation
.
 
<EOS>
In
that
way
Mr
Bazzard
became
my
clerk
,
and
he
feels
it
very
much
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
he
is
grateful
,
"
said
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
quite
mean
that
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
mean
,
that
he
feels
the
degradation
.
 
<EOS>
There
are
some
other
geniuses
that
Mr
Bazzard
has
become
acquainted
with
,
who
have
also
written
tragedies
,
<EOS>
which
likewise
nobody
will
on
any
account
whatever
hear
of
bringing
out
,
and
these
choice
spirits
dedicate
their
plays
to
one
another
in
a
highly
panegyrical
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Bazzard
has
been
the
subject
of
one
of
these
dedications
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
you
know
,
I
never
had
a
play
dedicated
to
ME
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
looked
at
him
as
if
she
would
have
liked
him
to
be
the
recipient
of
a
thousand
dedications
.
   
<EOS>
"
Which
again
,
naturally
,
rubs
against
the
grain
of
Mr
Bazzard
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
is
very
short
with
me
sometimes
,
and
then
I
feel
that
he
is
meditating
,
"
This
blockhead
is
my
master
!
 
<EOS>
A
fellow
who
could
n't
write
a
tragedy
on
pain
of
death
,
and
who
will
never
have
one
dedicated
to
him
with
the
most
complimentary
congratulations
on
the
high
position
he
has
taken
in
the
eyes
of
posterity
!
"
 
<EOS>
Very
trying
,
very
trying
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
in
giving
him
directions
,
I
reflect
beforehand
:
 
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
may
not
like
this
,
"
or
"
He
might
take
it
ill
if
I
asked
that
;
"
and
so
we
get
on
very
well
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
better
than
I
could
have
expected
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
tragedy
named
,
sir
?
"
asked
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Strictly
between
ourselves
,
"
answered
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
it
has
a
dreadfully
appropriate
name
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
called
The
Thorn
of
Anxiety
.
<EOS>
But
Mr
Bazzard
hopes
---
and
I
hope
---
that
it
will
come
out
at
last
.
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
not
hard
to
divine
that
Mr
Grewgious
had
related
the
Bazzard
history
thus
fully
,
at
least
quite
as
much
for
the
recreation
of
his
ward
's
mind
from
the
subject
that
had
driven
her
there
,
as
for
the
gratification
of
his
own
tendency
to
be
social
and
communicative
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
"
he
said
at
this
point
,
"
if
you
are
not
too
tired
to
tell
me
more
of
what
passed
to
-
day
---
but
only
if
you
feel
quite
able
---
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
digest
it
the
better
,
if
I
sleep
on
it
to
-
night
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
,
composed
now
,
gave
him
a
faithful
account
of
the
interview
.
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
often
smoothed
his
head
while
it
was
in
progress
,
and
begged
to
be
told
a
second
time
those
parts
which
bore
on
Helena
and
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
When
Rosa
had
finished
,
he
sat
grave
,
silent
,
and
meditative
for
a
while
.
   
<EOS>
"
Clearly
narrated
,
"
was
his
only
remark
at
last
,
"
and
,
I
hope
,
clearly
put
away
here
,
"
smoothing
his
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
"
See
,
my
dear
,
"
taking
her
to
the
open
window
,
"
where
they
live
!
 
<EOS>
The
dark
windows
over
yonder
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
may
go
to
Helena
to
-
morrow
?
"
asked
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
sleep
on
that
question
to
-
night
,
"
he
answered
doubtfully
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
let
me
take
you
to
your
own
rest
,
for
you
must
need
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
With
that
Mr
Grewgious
helped
her
to
get
her
hat
on
again
,
and
hung
upon
his
arm
the
very
little
bag
that
was
of
no
earthly
use
,
and
led
her
by
the
hand
(
with
a
certain
stately
awkwardness
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
walk
a
minuet
)
across
Holborn
,
and
into
Furnival
's
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
hotel
door
,
he
confided
her
to
the
Unlimited
head
chambermaid
,
and
said
that
while
she
went
up
to
see
her
room
,
he
would
remain
below
,
in
case
she
should
wish
it
exchanged
for
another
,
or
should
find
that
there
was
anything
she
wanted
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
's
room
was
airy
,
clean
,
comfortable
,
almost
gay
.
 
<EOS>
The
Unlimited
had
laid
in
everything
omitted
from
the
very
little
bag
(
that
is
to
say
,
everything
she
could
possibly
need
)
,
and
Rosa
tripped
down
the
great
many
stairs
again
,
to
thank
her
guardian
for
his
thoughtful
and
affectionate
care
of
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
at
all
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
infinitely
gratified
;
"
it
is
I
who
thank
you
for
your
charming
confidence
and
for
your
charming
company
.
 
<EOS>
Your
breakfast
will
be
provided
for
you
in
a
neat
,
compact
,
and
graceful
little
sitting
-
room
(
appropriate
to
your
figure
)
,
and
I
will
come
to
you
at
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
do
n't
feel
very
strange
indeed
,
in
this
strange
place
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
no
,
I
feel
so
safe
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
may
be
sure
that
the
stairs
are
fire
-
proof
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
and
that
any
outbreak
of
the
devouring
element
would
be
perceived
and
suppressed
by
the
watchmen
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
mean
that
,
"
Rosa
replied
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
I
feel
so
safe
from
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
stout
gate
of
iron
bars
to
keep
him
out
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
smiling
;
"
and
Furnival
's
is
fire
-
proof
,
and
specially
watched
and
lighted
,
and
I
live
over
the
way
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
stoutness
of
his
knight
-
errantry
,
he
seemed
to
think
the
last
-
named
protection
all
sufficient
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
spirit
he
said
to
the
gate
-
porter
as
he
went
out
,
"
If
some
one
staying
in
the
hotel
should
wish
to
send
across
the
road
to
me
in
the
night
,
a
crown
will
be
ready
for
the
messenger
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
the
same
spirit
,
he
walked
up
and
down
outside
the
iron
gate
for
the
best
part
of
an
hour
,
with
some
solicitude
;
occasionally
looking
in
between
the
bars
,
as
if
he
had
laid
a
dove
in
a
high
roost
in
a
cage
of
lions
,
and
had
it
on
his
mind
that
she
might
tumble
out
.

<EOS>
A
recognition
 
<EOS>
Nothing
occurred
in
the
night
to
flutter
the
tired
dove
;
and
the
dove
arose
refreshed
.
 
<EOS>
With
Mr
Grewgious
,
when
the
clock
struck
ten
in
the
morning
,
came
Mr
Crisparkle
,
who
had
come
at
one
plunge
out
of
the
river
at
Cloisterham
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
was
so
uneasy
,
Miss
Rosa
,
"
he
explained
to
her
,
"
and
came
round
to
Ma
and
me
with
your
note
,
in
such
a
state
of
wonder
,
that
,
to
quiet
her
,
I
volunteered
on
this
service
by
the
very
first
train
to
be
caught
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
I
wished
at
the
time
that
you
had
come
to
me
;
but
now
I
think
it
best
that
you
did
AS
you
did
,
and
came
to
your
guardian
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
think
of
you
,
"
Rosa
told
him
;
"
but
Minor
Canon
Corner
was
so
near
him
---
"
   
"
I
understand
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
natural
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
all
that
you
told
me
last
night
,
my
dear
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
I
should
have
written
it
to
him
immediately
;
but
his
coming
was
most
opportune
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
was
particularly
kind
of
him
to
come
,
for
he
had
<EOS>
but
just
gone
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
settled
,
"
asked
Rosa
,
appealing
to
them
both
,
"
what
is
to
be
done
for
Helena
and
her
brother
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
really
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
I
am
in
great
perplexity
.
 
<EOS>
If
even
Mr
Grewgious
,
whose
head
is
much
longer
than
mine
,
and
who
is
a
whole
night
's
cogitation
in
advance
of
me
,
is
undecided
,
what
must
I
be
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
Unlimited
here
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
---
after
having
rapped
,
and
been
authorised
to
present
herself
---
announcing
that
a
gentleman
wished
for
a
word
with
another
gentleman
named
Crisparkle
,
if
any
such
gentleman
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
If
no
such
gentleman
were
there
,
he
begged
pardon
for
being
mistaken
.
   
<EOS>
"
Such
a
gentleman
is
here
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
but
is
engaged
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
a
dark
gentleman
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Rosa
,
retreating
on
her
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
Miss
,
more
of
a
brown
gentleman
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
sure
not
with
black
hair
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Rosa
,
taking
courage
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Quite
sure
of
that
,
<EOS>
Miss.
 
Brown
hair
and
blue
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
,
"
hinted
Mr
Grewgious
,
with
habitual
caution
,
"
it
might
be
well
to
see
him
,
reverend
sir
,
if
you
do
n't
object
.
 
<EOS>
When
one
is
in
a
difficulty
or
at
a
loss
,
one
never
knows
in
what
direction
a
way
out
may
chance
to
open
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
business
principle
of
mine
,
in
such
a
case
,
not
to
close
up
any
direction
,
but
to
keep
an
eye
on
every
direction
that
may
present
itself
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
relate
an
anecdote
in
point
,
but
that
it
would
be
premature
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
Miss
Rosa
will
allow
me
,
then
?
 
<EOS>
Let
the
gentleman
come
in
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
came
in
;
apologised
,
with
a
frank
but
modest
grace
,
for
not
finding
Mr
Crisparkle
alone
;
turned
to
Mr
Crisparkle
,
and
smilingly
asked
the
unexpected
question
:
 
"
Who
am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
are
the
gentleman
I
saw
smoking
under
the
trees
in
Staple
Inn
,
a
few
minutes
ago
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
True
.
 
<EOS>
There
I
saw
you
.
 
<EOS>
Who
else
am
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
concentrated
his
attention
on
a
handsome
face
,
much
sunburnt
;
and
the
ghost
of
some
departed
boy
seemed
to
rise
,
gradually
and
dimly
,
in
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
The
gentleman
saw
a
struggling
recollection
lighten
up
the
Minor
Canon
's
features
,
and
smiling
again
,
said
:
 
"
What
will
you
have
for
breakfast
this
morning
?
 
<EOS>
You
are
out
of
jam
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
moment
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr
Crisparkle
,
raising
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Give
me
another
instant
!
 
<EOS>
Tartar
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
two
shook
hands
with
the
greatest
heartiness
,
and
then
went
the
wonderful
length
---
for
Englishmen
---
of
laying
their
hands
each
on
the
other
's
shoulders
,
and
looking
joyfully
each
into
the
other
's
face
.
   
<EOS>
"
My
old
fag
!
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
old
master
!
"
said
Mr
Tartar
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
saved
me
from
drowning
!
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
which
you
took
to
swimming
,
you
know
!
"
said
Mr
Tartar
.
   
<EOS>
"
God
bless
my
soul
!
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Amen
!
"
said
Mr
Tartar
.
   
<EOS>
And
then
they
fell
to
shaking
hands
most
heartily
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
Imagine
,
"
exclaimed
Mr
Crisparkle
,
with
glistening
eyes
:
 
<EOS>
"
Miss
Rosa
Bud
and
Mr
Grewgious
,
imagine
Mr
Tartar
,
when
he
was
the
smallest
of
juniors
,
diving
for
me
,
catching
me
,
a
big
heavy
senior
,
by
the
hair
of
the
head
,
and
striking
out
for
the
shore
with
me
like
a
water
-
giant
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Imagine
my
not
letting
him
sink
,
as
I
was
his
fag
!
"
said
Mr
Tartar
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
truth
being
that
he
was
my
best
protector
and
friend
,
and
did
me
more
good
than
all
the
masters
put
together
,
an
irrational
impulse
seized
me
to
pick
him
up
,
or
go
down
with
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
Permit
me
,
sir
,
to
have
the
honour
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
advancing
with
extended
hand
,
"
for
an
honour
I
truly
esteem
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
proud
to
make
your
acquaintance
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
you
did
n't
take
cold
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
were
not
inconvenienced
by
swallowing
too
much
water
.
<EOS>
How
have
you
been
since
?
"
   
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
apparent
that
Mr
Grewgious
knew
what
he
said
,
though
it
was
very
apparent
that
he
meant
to
say
something
highly
friendly
and
appreciative
.
   
<EOS>
If
Heaven
,
Rosa
thought
,
had
but
sent
such
courage
and
skill
to
her
poor
mother
's
aid
!
 
<EOS>
And
he
to
have
been
so
slight
and
young
then
!
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
complimented
upon
it
,
I
thank
you
;
but
I
think
I
have
an
idea
,
"
Mr
Grewgious
announced
,
after
taking
a
jog
-
trot
or
two
across
the
room
,
so
unexpected
and
unaccountable
that
they
all
stared
at
him
,
doubtful
whether
he
was
choking
or
had
the
cramp
---
<EOS>
"
I
THINK
I
have
an
idea
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
Mr
Tartar
's
name
as
tenant
of
the
top
set
in
the
house
next
the
top
set
in
the
corner
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr
Tartar
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
so
far
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
right
so
far
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tick
that
off
;
"
which
he
did
,
with
his
right
thumb
on
his
left
.
 
<EOS>
"
Might
you
happen
to
know
the
name
of
your
neighbour
in
the
top
set
on
the
other
side
of
the
party
-
wall
?
"
<EOS>
coming
very
close
to
Mr
Tartar
,
to
lose
nothing
of
his
face
,
in
his
shortness
of
sight
.
   
<EOS>
"
Landless
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tick
that
off
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
taking
another
trot
,
and
then
coming
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
personal
knowledge
,
I
suppose
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Slight
,
but
some
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Tick
that
off
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
taking
another
trot
,
and
again
coming
back
.
 
<EOS>
"
Nature
of
knowledge
,
Mr
Tartar
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
seemed
to
be
a
young
fellow
in
a
poor
way
,
and
I
asked
his
leave
---
only
within
a
day
or
so
---
to
share
my
flowers
up
there
with
him
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
extend
my
flower
-
garden
to
his
windows
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Would
you
have
the
kindness
to
take
seats
?
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
.
<EOS>
"
I
HAVE
an
idea
!
"
   
<EOS>
They
complied
;
Mr
Tartar
none
the
less
readily
,
for
being
all
abroad
;
and
Mr
Grewgious
,
seated
in
the
centre
,
with
his
hands
upon
his
knees
,
thus
stated
his
idea
,
with
his
usual
manner
of
having
got
the
statement
by
heart
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
as
yet
make
up
my
mind
whether
it
is
prudent
to
hold
open
communication
under
present
circumstances
,
and
on
the
part
of
the
fair
member
of
the
present
company
,
with
Mr
Neville
or
Miss
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
reason
to
know
that
a
local
friend
of
ours
(
on
whom
I
beg
to
bestow
a
passing
but
a
hearty
malediction
,
with
the
kind
permission
of
my
reverend
friend
)
sneaks
to
and
fro
,
and
dodges
up
and
down
.
 
<EOS>
When
not
doing
so
himself
,
he
may
have
some
informant
skulking
about
,
in
the
person
of
a
watchman
,
porter
,
or
such
-
like
hanger
-
on
of
Staple
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
Miss
Rosa
very
naturally
wishes
to
see
her
friend
Miss
Helena
,
and
it
would
seem
important
that
at
least
Miss
Helena
(
if
not
her
brother
too
,
through
her
)
should
privately
know
from
Miss
Rosa
's
lips
what
has
occurred
,
and
what
has
been
threatened
.
 
<EOS>
Am
I
agreed
with
generally
in
the
views
I
take
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
entirely
coincide
with
them
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
who
had
been
very
attentive
.
   
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
no
doubt
I
should
,
"
added
Mr
Tartar
,
smiling
,
"
if
I
understood
them
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Fair
and
softly
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
we
shall
fully
confide
in
you
directly
,
if
you
will
favour
us
with
your
permission
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
our
local
friend
should
have
any
informant
on
the
spot
,
it
is
tolerably
clear
that
such
informant
can
only
be
set
to
watch
the
chambers
in
the
occupation
of
Mr
Neville
.
 
<EOS>
He
reporting
,
to
our
local
friend
,
who
comes
and
goes
there
,
our
local
friend
would
supply
for
himself
,
from
his
own
previous
knowledge
,
the
identity
of
the
parties
.
 
<EOS>
Nobody
can
be
set
to
watch
all
Staple
,
or
to
concern
himself
with
comers
and
goers
to
other
sets
of
chambers
:
unless
,
indeed
,
mine
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
understand
to
what
you
tend
,
"
said
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
and
highly
approve
of
your
caution
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
need
n't
repeat
that
I
know
nothing
yet
of
the
why
and
wherefore
,
"
said
Mr
Tartar
;
"
but
I
also
understand
to
what
you
tend
,
so
let
me
say
at
once
that
my
chambers
are
freely
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
cried
Mr
Grewgious
,
smoothing
his
head
triumphantly
,
"
now
we
have
all
got
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
You
have
it
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
,
"
said
Rosa
,
blushing
a
little
as
Mr
Tartar
looked
quickly
towards
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
you
go
over
to
Staple
with
Mr
Crisparkle
and
Mr
Tartar
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
;
"
I
going
in
and
out
,
and
out
and
in
alone
,
in
my
usual
way
;
you
go
up
with
those
gentlemen
to
Mr
Tartar
's
rooms
;
you
look
into
Mr
Tartar
's
flower
-
garden
;
you
wait
for
Miss
Helena
's
appearance
there
,
or
you
signify
to
Miss
Helena
that
you
are
close
by
;
and
you
communicate
with
her
freely
,
and
no

<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
much
afraid
I
shall
be
<EOS>
---
"
   
"
Be
what
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
Mr
Grewgious
,
as
she
hesitated
.
 
<EOS>
"
Not
frightened
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
that
,
"
said
Rosa
,
shyly
;
"
in
Mr
Tartar
's
way
.
 
<EOS>
We
seem
to
be
appropriating
Mr
Tartar
's
residence
so
very
coolly
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
protest
to
you
,
"
returned
that
gentleman
,
"
that
I
shall
think
the
better
of
it
for
evermore
,
if
your
voice
sounds
in
it
only
once
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
,
not
quite
knowing
what
to
say
about
that
,
cast
down
her
eyes
,
and
turning
to
Mr
Grewgious
,
dutifully
asked
if
she
should
put
her
hat
on
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
being
of
opinion
that
she
could
not
do
better
,
she
withdrew
for
the
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
took
the
opportunity
of
giving
Mr
Tartar
a
summary
of
the
distresses
of
Neville
and
his
sister
;
the
opportunity
was
quite
long
enough
,
as
the
hat
happened
to
require
a
little
extra
fitting
on
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
gave
his
arm
to
Rosa
,
and
Mr
Crisparkle
walked
,
detached
,
in
front
.
   
<EOS>
"
Poor
,
poor
Eddy
!
<EOS>
"
thought
Rosa
,
as
they
went
along
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
waved
his
right
hand
as
he
bent
his
head
down
over
Rosa
,
talking
in
an
animated
way
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
so
powerful
or
so
sun
-
browned
when
it
saved
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
thought
Rosa
,
glancing
at
it
;
"
but
it
must
have
been
very
steady
and
determined
even
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
told
her
he
had
been
a
sailor
,
roving
everywhere
for
years
and
years
.
   
<EOS>
"
When
are
you
going
to
sea
again
?
"
asked
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Never
!
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
wondered
what
the
girls
would
say
if
they
could
see
her
crossing
the
wide
street
on
the
sailor
's
arm
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
fancied
that
the
passers
-
by
must
think
her
very
little
and
very
helpless
,
contrasted
with
the
strong
figure
that
could
have
caught
her
up
and
carried
her
out
of
any
danger
,
miles
and
miles
without
resting
.
   
<EOS>
She
was
thinking
further
,
that
his
far
-
seeing
blue
eyes
looked
as
if
they
had
been
used
to
watch
danger
afar
off
,
and
to
watch
it
without
flinching
,
drawing
nearer
and
nearer
:
 
<EOS>
when
,
happening
to
raise
her
own
eyes
,
she
found
that
he
seemed
to
be
thinking
something
about
THEM
.
   
<EOS>
This
a
little
confused
Rosebud
,
and
may
account
for
her
never
afterwards
quite
knowing
how
she
ascended
(
with
his
help
)
to
his
garden
in
the
air
,
and
seemed
to
get
into
a
marvellous
country
that
came
into
sudden
bloom
like
the
country
on
the
summit
of
the
magic
bean
-
stalk
.
 
<EOS>
May
it
flourish
for
ever
!
    
<EOS>
Chapter
22
.
<EOS>
A
gritty
state
of
things
comes
on
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
's
chambers
were
the
neatest
,
the
cleanest
,
and
the
best
-
ordered
chambers
ever
seen
under
the
sun
,
moon
,
and
stars
.
 
<EOS>
The
floors
were
scrubbed
to
that
extent
,
that
you
might
have
supposed
the
London
blacks
emancipated
for
ever
,
and
gone
out
of
the
land
for
good
.
 
<EOS>
Every
inch
of
brass
-
work
in
Mr
Tartar
's
possession
was
polished
and
burnished
,
till
it
shone
like
a
brazen
mirror
.
 
<EOS>
No
speck
,
nor
spot
,
nor
spatter
soiled
the
purity
of
any
of
Mr
Tartar
's
household
gods
,
large
,
small
,
or
middle
-
sized
.
 
<EOS>
His
sitting
-
room
was
like
the
admiral
's
cabin
,
his
bath
-
room
was
like
a
dairy
,
his
sleeping
-
chamber
,
fitted
all
about
with
lockers
and
drawers
,
<EOS>
was
like
a
seedsman
's
shop
;
and
his
nicely
-
balanced
cot
just
stirred
in
the
midst
,
as
if
it
breathed
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
belonging
to
Mr
Tartar
had
quarters
of
its
own
assigned
to
it
:
 
his
maps
and
charts
had
their
quarters
;
his
books
had
theirs
;
his
brushes
had
theirs
;
his
boots
had
theirs
;
his
clothes
had
theirs
;
his
case
-
bottles
had
theirs
;
his
telescopes
and
other
instruments
had
theirs
.
 
<EOS>
Everything
was
readily
accessible
.
 
<EOS>
Shelf
,
bracket
,
locker
,
hook
,
and
drawer
were
equally
within
reach
,
and
were
equally
contrived
with
a
view
to
avoiding
waste
of
room
,
and
providing
some
snug
inches
of
stowage
for
something
that
would
have
exactly
fitted
nowhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
His
gleaming
little
service
of
plate
was
so
arranged
upon
his
sideboard
as
that
a
slack
salt
-
spoon
would
have
instantly
betrayed
itself
;
his
toilet
implements
were
so
arranged
upon
his
dressing
-
table
as
that
a
toothpick
of
slovenly
deportment
could
have
been
reported
at
a
glance
.
 
<EOS>
So
with
the
curiosities
he
had
brought
home
from
various
voyages
.
 
<EOS>
Stuffed
,
dried
,
repolished
,
or
otherwise
preserved
,
according
to
their
kind
;
birds
,
fishes
,
reptiles
,
arms
,
articles
of
dress
,
shells
,
seaweeds
,
grasses
,
or
memorials
of
coral
reef
;
each
was
displayed
in
its
especial
place
,
and
each
could
have
been
displayed
in
no
better
place
.
 
<EOS>
Paint
and
varnish
seemed
to
be
kept
somewhere
out
of
sight
,
in
constant
readiness
to
obliterate
stray
finger
-
marks
wherever
any
might
become
perceptible
in
Mr
Tartar
's
chambers
.
 
<EOS>
No
man
-
of
-
war
was
ever
kept
more
spick
and
span
from
careless
touch
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
bright
summer
day
,
a
neat
awning
was
rigged
over
Mr
Tartar
's
flower
-
garden
as
only
a
sailor
can
rig
it
,
and
there
was
a
sea
-
going
air
upon
the
whole
effect
,
so
delightfully
complete
,
that
the
flower
-
garden
might
have
appertained
to
stern
-
windows
afloat
,
and
the
whole
concern
might
have
bowled
away
gallantly
with
all
on
board
,
if
Mr
Tartar
had
only
clapped
to
his
lips
the
speaking
-
trumpet
that
was
slung
in
a
corner
,
and
given
hoarse
orders
to
heave
the
anchor
up
,
look
alive
there
,
men
,
and
get
all
sail
upon
her
!
   
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
doing
the
honours
of
this
gallant
craft
was
of
a
piece
with
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
When
a
man
rides
an
amiable
hobby
that
shies
at
nothing
and
kicks
nobody
,
it
is
only
agreeable
to
find
him
riding
it
with
a
humorous
sense
of
the
droll
side
of
the
creature
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
man
is
a
cordial
and
an
earnest
man
by
nature
,
and
withal
is
perfectly
fresh
and
genuine
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
is
ever
seen
to
greater
advantage
than
at
such
a
time
.
 
<EOS>
So
Rosa
would
have
naturally
thought
(
even
if
she
had
n't
been
conducted
over
the
ship
with
all
the
homage
due
to
the
First
Lady
of
the
Admiralty
,
or
First
Fairy
of
the
Sea
)
,
that
it
was
charming
to
see
and
hear
Mr
Tartar
half
laughing
at
,
and
half
rejoicing
in
,
his
various
contrivances
.
 
<EOS>
So
Rosa
would
have
naturally
thought
,
anyhow
,
that
the
sunburnt
sailor
showed
to
great
advantage
<EOS>
when
,
the
inspection
finished
,
he
delicately
withdrew
out
of
his
admiral
's
cabin
,
beseeching
her
to
consider
herself
its
Queen
,
and
waving
her
free
of
his
flower
-
garden
with
the
hand
that
had
had
Mr
Crisparkle
's
life
in
it
.
   
<EOS>
"
Helena
!
 
<EOS>
Helena
Landless
!
 
<EOS>
Are
you
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
speaks
to
me
?
 
<EOS>
Not
Rosa
?
"
 
<EOS>
Then
a
second
handsome
face
appearing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
my
darling
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
did
you
come
here
,
dearest
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
---
I
do
n't
quite
know
,
"
said
Rosa
with
a
blush
;
"
unless
I
am
dreaming
!
"
   
<EOS>
Why
with
a
blush
?
 
<EOS>
For
their
two
faces
were
alone
with
the
other
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
Are
blushes
among
the
fruits
of
the
country
of
the
magic
bean
-
stalk
?
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
dreaming
,
"
said
Helena
,
smiling
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
take
more
for
granted
if
I
were
.
 
<EOS>
How
do
we
come
together
---
or
so
near
together
---
so
very
unexpectedly
?
"
   
<EOS>
Unexpectedly
indeed
,
among
the
dingy
gables
and
chimney
-
pots
of
P*J*T
's
connection
,
and
the
flowers
that
had
sprung
from
the
salt
sea
.
 
<EOS>
But
Rosa
,
waking
,
told
in
a
hurry
how
they
came
to
be
together
,
and
all
the
why
and
wherefore
of
that
matter
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
Mr
Crisparkle
is
here
,
"
said
Rosa
,
in
rapid
conclusion
;
"
and
,
could
you
believe
it
?
<EOS>
long
ago
he
saved
his
life
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
could
believe
any
such
thing
of
Mr
Crisparkle
,
"
returned
Helena
,
with
a
mantling
face
.
   
<EOS>
(
More
blushes
in
the
bean
-
stalk
country
!
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
it
was
n't
Crisparkle
,
"
said
Rosa
,
quickly
putting
in
the
correction
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
,
love
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
very
nice
of
Mr
Crisparkle
to
be
saved
,
"
said
Rosa
,
"
and
he
could
n't
have
shown
his
high
opinion
of
Mr
Tartar
more
expressively
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
Mr
Tartar
who
saved
him
.
"
   
<EOS>
Helena
's
dark
eyes
looked
very
earnestly
at
the
bright
face
among
the
leaves
,
and
she
asked
,
in
a
slower
and
more
thoughtful
tone
:
   
"
Is
Mr
Tartar
with
you
now
,
dear
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
;
because
he
has
given
up
his
rooms
to
me
---
to
us
,
I
mean
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
beautiful
place
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
like
the
inside
of
the
most
exquisite
ship
that
ever
sailed
.
<EOS>
It
is
like
<EOS>
---
it
is
like
---
"
   
"
Like
a
dream
?
"
suggested
Helena
.
   
<EOS>
Rosa
answered
with
a
little
nod
,
and
smelled
the
flowers
.
   
<EOS>
Helena
resumed
,
after
a
short
pause
of
silence
,
during
which
she
seemed
(
or
it
was
Rosa
's
fancy
)
to
compassionate
somebody
:
 
"
My
poor
Neville
is
reading
in
his
own
room
,
the
sun
being
so
very
bright
on
this
side
just
now
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
he
had
better
not
know
that
you
are
so
near
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
I
think
so
too
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosa
very
readily
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
"
pursued
Helena
,
doubtfully
,
"
that
he
must
know
by
-
and
-
by
all
you
have
told
me
;
but
I
am
not
sure
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
Mr
Crisparkle
's
advice
,
my
darling
.
 
<EOS>
Ask
him
whether
I
may
tell
Neville
as
much
or
as
little
of
what
you
have
told
me
as
I
think
best
.
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
subsided
into
her
state
-
cabin
,
and
propounded
the
question
.
<EOS>
The
Minor
Canon
was
for
the
free
exercise
of
Helena
's
judgment
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
very
much
,
"
said
Helena
,
when
Rosa
emerged
again
with
her
report
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ask
him
whether
it
would
be
best
to
wait
until
any
more
maligning
and
pursuing
of
Neville
on
the
part
of
this
wretch
shall
disclose
itself
,
or
to
try
to
anticipate
it
:
 
I
mean
,
so
far
as
to
find
out
whether
any
such
goes
on
darkly
about
us
?
"
   
<EOS>
The
Minor
Canon
found
this
point
so
difficult
to
give
a
confident
opinion
on
,
that
,
after
two
or
three
attempts
and
failures
,
he
suggested
a
reference
to
Mr
Grewgious
.
 
<EOS>
Helena
acquiescing
,
he
betook
himself
(
with
a
most
unsuccessful
assumption
of
lounging
indifference
)
across
the
quadrangle
to
P*J*T
's
,
and
stated
it
.
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
held
decidedly
to
the
general
principle
,
that
if
you
could
steal
a
march
upon
a
brigand
or
a
wild
beast
,
you
had
better
do
it
;
and
he
also
held
decidedly
to
the
special
case
,
that
John
Jasper
was
a
brigand
and
a
wild
beast
in
combination
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
advised
,
Mr
Crisparkle
came
back
again
and
reported
to
Rosa
,
who
in
her
turn
reported
to
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
She
now
steadily
pursuing
her
train
of
thought
at
her
window
,
considered
thereupon
.
   
<EOS>
"
We
may
count
on
Mr
Tartar
's
readiness
to
help
us
,
Rosa
?
<EOS>
"
she
inquired
.
   
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Rosa
shyly
thought
so
.
 
<EOS>
O
yes
,
Rosa
shyly
believed
she
could
almost
answer
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
should
she
ask
Mr
Crisparkle
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
authority
on
the
point
as
good
as
his
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Helena
,
sedately
,
"
and
you
need
n't
disappear
again
for
that
.
"
 
<EOS>
Odd
of
Helena
!
   
<EOS>
"
You
see
,
Neville
,
"
Helena
pursued
after
more
reflection
,
"
knows
no
one
else
here
:
 
<EOS>
he
has
not
so
much
as
exchanged
a
word
with
any
one
else
here
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Tartar
would
call
to
see
him
openly
and
often
;
if
he
would
spare
a
minute
for
the
purpose
,
frequently
;
if
he
would
even
do
so
,
almost
daily
;
something
might
come
of
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Something
might
come
of
it
,
dear
?
"
repeated
Rosa
,
surveying
her
friend
's
beauty
with
a
highly
perplexed
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Something
might
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
Neville
's
movements
are
really
watched
,
and
if
the
purpose
really
is
to
isolate
him
from
all
friends
and
acquaintance
and
wear
his
daily
life
out
grain
by
grain
(
which
would
seem
to
be
the
threat
to
you
)
,
does
it
not
appear
likely
,
"
said
Helena
,
"
that
his
enemy
would
in
some
way
communicate
with
Mr
Tartar
to
warn
him
off
from
Neville
?
 
<EOS>
In
which
case
,
we
might
not
only
know
the
fact
,
but
might
know
from
Mr
Tartar
what
the
terms
of
the
communication
were
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
see
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
And
immediately
darted
into
her
state
-
cabin
again
.
   
<EOS>
Presently
her
pretty
face
reappeared
,
with
a
greatly
heightened
colour
,
and
she
said
that
she
had
told
Mr
Crisparkle
,
and
that
Mr
Crisparkle
had
fetched
in
Mr
Tartar
,
and
that
Mr
Tartar
---
"
who
is
waiting
now
,
in
case
you
want
him
,
"
added
Rosa
,
with
a
half
look
back
,
and
in
not
a
little
confusion
between
the
inside
of
the
state
-
cabin
and
out
---
had
declared
his
readiness
to
act
as
she
had
suggested
,
and
to
enter
on
his
task
that
very
day
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
thank
him
from
my
heart
,
"
said
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
tell
him
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
Again
not
a
little
confused
between
the
Flower
-
garden
and
the
Cabin
,
Rosa
dipped
in
with
her
message
,
and
dipped
out
again
with
more
assurances
from
Mr
Tartar
,
and
stood
wavering
in
a
divided
state
between
Helena
and
him
,
which
proved
that
confusion
is
not
always
necessarily
awkward
,
but
may
sometimes
present
a
very
pleasant
appearance
.
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
darling
,
"
said
Helena
,
"
we
will
be
mindful
of
the
caution
that
has
restricted
us
to
this
interview
for
the
present
,
and
will
part
.
 
<EOS>
I
hear
Neville
moving
too
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
going
back
?
<EOS>
"
   
"
<EOS>
To
Miss
Twinkleton
's
?
"
asked
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
O
,
I
could
never
go
there
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
indeed
,
after
that
dreadful
interview
!
"
said
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
where
ARE
you
going
,
pretty
one
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Now
I
come
to
think
of
it
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Rosa
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
settled
nothing
at
all
yet
,
but
my
guardian
will
take
care
of
me
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
uneasy
,
dear
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sure
to
be
somewhere
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
(
It
did
seem
likely
.
)
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
shall
hear
of
my
Rosebud
from
Mr
Tartar
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Helena
.
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
;
from
---
"
Rosa
looked
back
again
in
a
flutter
,
instead
of
supplying
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
one
thing
before
we
part
,
dearest
Helena
.
 
<EOS>
Tell
me
---
that
you
are
sure
,
sure
,
sure
,
I
could
n't
help
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Help
it
,
love
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Help
making
him
malicious
and
revengeful
.
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
hold
any
terms
with
him
,
could
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
how
I
love
you
,
darling
,
"
answered
Helena
,
with
indignation
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
would
sooner
see
you
dead
at
his
wicked
feet
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
great
comfort
to
me
!
 
<EOS>
And
you
will
tell
your
poor
brother
<EOS>
so
,
wo
n't
you
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
will
give
him
my
remembrance
and
my
sympathy
?
 
<EOS>
And
you
will
ask
him
not
to
hate
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
With
a
mournful
shake
of
the
head
,
as
if
that
would
be
quite
a
superfluous
entreaty
,
Helena
lovingly
kissed
her
two
hands
to
her
friend
,
and
her
friend
's
two
hands
were
kissed
to
her
;
and
then
she
saw
a
third
hand
(
a
brown
one
)
appear
among
the
flowers
and
leaves
,
and
help
her
friend
out
of
sight
.
   
<EOS>
The
refection
that
Mr
Tartar
produced
in
the
Admiral
's
Cabin
by
merely
touching
the
spring
knob
of
a
locker
and
the
handle
of
a
drawer
,
was
a
dazzling
enchanted
repast
.
 
<EOS>
Wonderful
macaroons
,
glittering
liqueurs
,
magically
-
preserved
tropical
spices
,
and
jellies
of
celestial
tropical
fruits
,
displayed
themselves
profusely
at
an
instant
's
notice
.
 
<EOS>
But
Mr
Tartar
could
not
make
time
stand
still
;
and
time
,
with
his
hard
-
hearted
fleetness
<EOS>
,
strode
on
so
fast
,
that
Rosa
was
obliged
to
come
down
from
the
bean
-
stalk
country
to
earth
and
her
guardian
's
chambers
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
what
is
to
be
done
next
?
<EOS>
To
put
the
same
thought
in
another
form
;
what
is
to
be
done
with
you
?
"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
could
only
look
apologetically
sensible
of
being
very
much
in
her
own
way
and
in
everybody
else
's
.
 
<EOS>
Some
passing
idea
of
living
,
fireproof
,
up
a
good
many
stairs
in
Furnival
's
Inn
for
the
rest
of
her
life
,
was
the
only
thing
in
the
nature
of
a
plan
that
occurred
to
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
has
come
into
my
thoughts
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
that
as
the
respected
lady
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
occasionally
repairs
to
London
in
the
recess
,
with
the
view
of
extending
her
connection
,
and
being
available
for
interviews
with
metropolitan
parents
,
if
any
---
whether
,
until
we
have
time
in
which
to
turn
ourselves
round
,
we
might
invite
Miss
Twinkleton
to
come
and
stay
with
you
for
a
month
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Stay
<EOS>
where
,
sir
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Whether
,
"
explained
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
we
might
take
a
furnished
lodging
in
town
for
a
month
,
and
invite
Miss
Twinkleton
to
assume
the
charge
of
you
in
it
for
that
period
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
afterwards
?
<EOS>
"
hinted
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
afterwards
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
we
should
be
no
worse
off
than
we
are
now
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
that
might
smooth
the
way
,
"
assented
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
Then
let
us
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
rising
,
"
go
and
look
for
a
furnished
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
acceptable
to
me
than
the
sweet
presence
of
last
evening
,
for
all
the
remaining
evenings
of
my
existence
;
but
these
are
not
fit
surroundings
for
a
young
lady
.
<EOS>
Let
us
set
out
in
quest
of
adventures
,
and
look
for
a
furnished
lodging
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Mr
Crisparkle
here
,
about
to
return
home
immediately
,
will
no
doubt
kindly
see
Miss
Twinkleton
,
and
invite
that
lady
to
co
-
operate
in
our
plan
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
,
willingly
accepting
the
commission
,
took
his
departure
;
Mr
Grewgious
and
his
ward
set
forth
on
their
expedition
.
   
<EOS>
As
Mr
Grewgious
's
idea
of
looking
at
a
furnished
lodging
was
to
get
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
to
a
house
with
a
suitable
bill
in
the
window
,
and
stare
at
it
;
and
then
work
his
way
tortuously
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
stare
at
that
;
and
then
not
go
in
,
but
make
similar
trials
of
another
house
,
with
the
same
result
;
their
progress
was
but
slow
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
bethought
himself
of
a
widowed
cousin
,
divers
times
removed
,
of
Mr
Bazzard
's
,
who
had
once
solicited
his
influence
in
the
lodger
world
,
and
who
lived
in
Southampton
Street
,
Bloomsbury
Square
.
<EOS>
This
lady
's
name
,
stated
in
uncompromising
capitals
of
considerable
size
on
a
brass
door
-
plate
,
and
yet
not
lucidly
as
to
sex
or
condition
,
was
BILLICKIN
.
   
<EOS>
Personal
faintness
,
and
an
overpowering
personal
candour
,
were
the
distinguishing
features
of
Mrs
Billickin
's
organisation
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
languishing
out
of
her
own
exclusive
back
parlour
,
with
the
air
of
having
been
expressly
brought
-
to
for
the
purpose
,
from
an
accumulation
of
several
swoons
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
hope
I
see
you
well
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs
Billickin
,
recognising
her
visitor
with
a
bend
.
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
quite
well
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
,
ma'am
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Mr
Grewgious
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
well
,
"
said
Mrs
Billickin
,
becoming
aspirational
with
excess
of
faintness
,
"
as
I
hever
ham
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
ward
and
an
elderly
lady
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
wish
to
find
a
genteel
lodging
for
a
month
or
so
.
 
<EOS>
Have
you
any
apartments
available
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
returned
Mrs
Billickin
,
"
I
will
not
deceive
you
;
far
from
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
HAVE
apartments
available
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
This
with
the
air
of
adding
:
 
<EOS>
"
Convey
me
to
the
stake
,
if
you
will
;
but
while
I
live
,
I
will
be
candid
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
what
apartments
,
ma'am
?
"
asked
Mr
Grewgious
,
cosily
.
 
<EOS>
To
tame
a
certain
severity
apparent
on
the
part
of
Mrs
Billickin
.
   
<EOS>
"
There
is
this
sitting
-
room
---
which
,
call
it
what
you
will
,
it
is
the
front
parlour
,
Miss
,
"
said
Mrs
Billickin
,
impressing
Rosa
into
the
conversation
:
 
"
the
back
parlour
being
what
I
cling
to
and
never
part
with
;
and
there
is
two
bedrooms
at
the
top
of
the
'
ouse
with
gas
laid
on
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
tell
you
that
your
bedroom
floors
is
firm
,
for
firm
they
are
not
.
 
<EOS>
The
gas
-
fitter
himself
allowed
,
that
to
make
a
firm
job
,
he
must
go
right
under
your
jistes
,
and
it
were
not
worth
the
outlay
as
a
yearly
tenant
so
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
piping
is
carried
above
your
jistes
,
and
it
is
best
that
it
should
be
made
known
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
and
Rosa
exchanged
looks
of
some
dismay
,
though
they
had
not
the
least
idea
<EOS>
what
latent
horrors
this
carriage
of
the
piping
might
involve
.
 
<EOS>
Mrs
Billickin
put
her
hand
to
her
heart
,
as
having
eased
it
of
a
load
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
The
roof
is
all
right
,
no
doubt
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
plucking
up
a
little
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
returned
Mrs
Billickin
,
"
if
I
was
to
tell
you
,
sir
,
that
to
have
nothink
above
you
<EOS>
is
to
have
a
floor
above
you
<EOS>
,
I
should
put
a
deception
upon
you
which
I
will
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
No

<EOS>
Your
slates
WILL
rattle
loose
at
that

in
windy
weather

I

<EOS>
sir

be
you

to
keep
your
slates
tight

try
how
you

"
 
<EOS>
Here
Mrs
Billickin
,
having
been
warm
with
Mr
Grewgious
,
cooled
a
little
,
not
to
abuse
the
moral
power
she
held
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
Consequent
,
"
proceeded
Mrs
Billickin
,
more
mildly
,
but
still
firmly
in
her
incorruptible
candour
:
 
<EOS>
"
consequent
<EOS>
it
would
be
worse
than
of
no
use
for
me
to
trapse
and
travel
up
to
the
top
of
the
'
ouse
with
you
,
and
for
you
to
say
,
"
Mrs
Billickin
,
what
stain
do
I
notice
in
the
ceiling
,
for
a
stain
I
do
consider
it
?
"
<EOS>
and
for
me
to
answer
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
understand
you
,
sir
.
"
 
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
I
will
not
be
so
underhand
.
 
<EOS>
I
DO
understand
you
before
you
pint
it
out

<EOS>
It
is
the
wet
,
sir

<EOS>
It
do
come
in

and
it
do
not
come
in
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
lay
dry
there
half
your
lifetime
;
but
the
time
will
come
,
and
it
is
best
that
you
should
know
it
,
when
a
dripping
sop
would
be
no
name
for
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
looked
much
disgraced
by
being
prefigured
in
this
pickle
.
   
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
other
apartments
,
ma'am
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Grewgious

"
returned
Mrs
Billickin
,
with
much
solemnity
,
"
I
have

<EOS>
You
ask
me

I

and
my
open

my
honest
answer
air
<EOS>
,
I
have
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
and
second
floors

wacant
,

sweet
rooms

"
   
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
!
 
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
against
THEM
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
comforting
himself
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
replied
Mrs
Billickin
,
"
pardon
me
,
there
is
the
stairs
.
 
<EOS>
Unless
your
mind
is
prepared
for
the
stairs
,
it
will
lead
to
inevitable
disappointment
.
 
<EOS>
You
can
not
,
Miss
,
"
said
Mrs
Billickin
,
addressing
Rosa
reproachfully
,
"
place
a
first
floor
,
and
far
less
a
second
,
on
the
level
footing
"
of
a
parlour
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
you
can
not
do
it
,
Miss
,
it
is
beyond
your
power
,
and
wherefore
try
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Billickin
put
it
very
feelingly
,
as
if
Rosa
had
shown
a
headstrong
determination
to
hold
the
untenable
position
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
we
see
these
rooms
,
ma'am
?
"
inquired
her
guardian
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
returned
Mrs
Billickin
,
"
you
can
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
disguise
it
from
you
,
sir
;
you
can
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mrs
Billickin
then
sent
into
her
back
parlour
for
her
shawl
(
it
being
a
state
fiction
,
dating
from
immemorial
antiquity
,
that
she
could
never
go
anywhere
without
being
wrapped
up
)
,
and
having
been
enrolled
by
her
attendant
,
led
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
She
made
various
genteel
pauses
on
the
stairs
for
breath
,
and
clutched
at
her
heart
in
the
drawing
-
room
as
if
it
had
very
nearly
got
loose
,
and
she
had
caught
it
in
the
act
of
taking
wing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
second

said
Mr
Grewgious
,
on
finding
the
first
satisfactory
.
   
<EOS>
"
Mr
Grewgious
,
"
replied
Mrs
Billickin
,
turning
upon
him
with
ceremony
,
as
if
the
time
had
now
come
when
a
distinct
understanding
on
a
difficult
point
must
be
arrived
at
,
and
a
solemn
confidence
established
,
"
the
second
floor
is
over
this
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Can
we
see
that
too
,
ma'am
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mrs
Billickin
,
"
it
is
open
as
the
day
.
"
   
<EOS>
That
also
proving
satisfactory
,
Mr
Grewgious
retired
into
a
window
with
Rosa
for
a
few
words
of
consultation
,
and
then
asking
for
pen
and
ink
,
sketched
out
a
line
or
two
of
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
Mrs
Billickin
took
a
seat
,
and
delivered
a
kind
of
Index
to
,
or
Abstract
of
,
the
general
question
.
   
<EOS>
"
Five

said
Mrs
Billickin
,
"
is
only
reasonable
to
both

<EOS>
It

not
Bond

but
it
is
not
pretended
that

<EOS>
Neither

it
attempted
to

why

<EOS>
She
emphasised
the
prepositions
as
marking
a
subtle
but
immense
difference
.
 
<EOS>
"
Dogs

not

<EOS>
Besides

"
   
<EOS>
By
this
time
Mr
Grewgious
had
his
agreement
-
lines
,
and
his
earnest
-
money
,
ready
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
have
signed
it

said
,
"

<EOS>

Mr

said
Mrs
Billickin
in
a
new
burst
of
candour
,
"
no

<EOS>
You
must
excuse
the

"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
stared
at
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
The

used

said
Mrs

<EOS>
Mr

stared
at
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
Mr
Grewgious
,
you
must
excuse
me
.
 
<EOS>
So
long
as
this

ouse
is
known
indefinite
as
Billickin

and
so
long
as
it
is
a

be

,
near

or
down

and
what

so
long
I
feel
safe

<EOS>
But
commit
myself
to
a
solitary
female
statement
,
no
,
Miss
!
<EOS>
Nor
would
you
for
a
moment
wish
,
"
said
Mrs
Billickin
,
with
a
strong
sense
of
injury
,
"
to
take
that
advantage
of
your
sex
,
if
you
were
not
brought
to
it
by
inconsiderate
example

"
   
<EOS>
Rosa
reddening
as
if
she
had
made
some
most
disgraceful
attempt
to
overreach
the
good
lady
,
besought
Mr
Grewgious
to
rest
content
with
any
signature
.
 
<EOS>
And
accordingly
,
in
a
baronial
way
,
the
sign
-
manual
BILLICKIN
got
appended
to
the
document
.
   
<EOS>
Details
were
then
settled
for
taking
possession
on
the
next
day
but
one
,
when
Miss
Twinkleton
might
be
reasonably
expected
;
and
Rosa
went
back
to
Furnival
's
Inn
on
her
guardian
's
arm
.
   
<EOS>
Behold
Mr
Tartar
walking
up
and
down
Furnival
's
Inn
,
checking
himself
when
he
saw
them
coming
,
and
advancing
towards
them
!
   
<EOS>
"
It
occurred
to
me
,
"
hinted
Mr
Tartar
,
"
that
we
might
go
up
the
river
,
the
weather
being
so
delicious
and
the
tide
serving
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
boat
of
my
own
at
the
Temple
Stairs
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
been
up
the
river
for
this
many
a
day
,
"
said
Mr
Grewgious
,
tempted
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
was
never
up
the
river
,
"
added
Rosa
.
   
<EOS>
Within
half
an
hour
they
were
setting
this
matter
right
by
going
up
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
The
tide
was
running
with
them
,
the
afternoon
was
charming
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
's
boat
was
perfect
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
and
Lobley
<EOS>
(
Mr
Tartar
's
man
)
pulled
a
pair
of
oars
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
had
a
yacht
,
it
seemed
,
lying
somewhere
down
by
Greenhithe
;
and
Mr
Tartar
's
man
had
charge
of
this
yacht
,
and
was
detached
upon
his
present
service
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
jolly
-
favoured
man
,
with
tawny
hair
and
whiskers
,
and
a
big
red
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
dead
image
of
the
sun
in
old
woodcuts
,
his
hair
and
whiskers
answering
for
rays
all
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
Resplendent
in
the
bow
of
the
boat
,
he
was
a
shining
sight
,
with
a
man
-
of
-
war
's
man
's
shirt
on
---
or
off
,
according
to
opinion
---
and
his
arms
and
breast
tattooed
all
sorts
of
patterns
.
 
<EOS>
Lobley
seemed
to
take
it
easily
,
and
so
did
Mr
Tartar
;
yet
their
oars
bent
as
they
pulled
,
and
the
boat
bounded
under
them
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Tartar
talked
as
if
he
were
doing
nothing
,
to
Rosa
who
was
really
doing
nothing
,
and
to
Mr
Grewgious
who
was
doing
this
much
that
he
steered
all
wrong
;
but
what
did
that
matter
,
when
a
turn
of
Mr
Tartar
's
skilful
wrist
,
or
a
mere
grin
of
Mr
Lobley
's
over
the
bow
,
put
all
to
rights
!
 
<EOS>
The
tide
bore
them
on
in
the
gayest
and
most
sparkling
manner
,
until
they
stopped
to
dine
in
some
ever
-
lastingly
-
green
garden
,
needing
no
matter
-
of
-
fact
identification
here
;
and
then
the
tide
obligingly
turned
---
being
devoted
to
that
party
alone
for
that
day
;
and
as
they
floated
idly
among
some
osier
-
beds
,
Rosa
tried
what
she
could
do
in
the
rowing
way
,
and
came
off
splendidly
,
being
much
assisted
;
and
Mr
Grewgious
tried
what
he
could
do
,
and
came
off
on
his
back
,
doubled
up
with
an
oar
under
his
chin
,
being
not
assisted
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Then
there
was
an
interval
of
rest
under
boughs
(
such
rest
!
)
<EOS>
what
time
Mr
Lobley
mopped
,
and
,
arranging
cushions
,
stretchers
,
and
the
like
,
danced
the
tight
-
rope
<EOS>
the
whole
length
of
the
boat
like
a
man
to
whom
shoes
were
a
superstition
and
stockings
slavery
;
and
then
came
the
sweet
return
among
delicious
odours
of
limes
in
bloom
,
and
musical
ripplings
;
and
,
all
too
soon
,
the
great
black
city
cast
its
shadow
on
the
waters
,
and
its
dark
bridges
spanned
them
as
death
spans
life
,
and
the
everlastingly
-
green
garden
seemed
to
be
left
for
everlasting
,
unregainable
and
far
away
.
   
<EOS>
"
Can
not
people
get
through
life
without
gritty
stages
,
I
wonder
?
"
<EOS>
Rosa
thought
next
day
,
when
the
town
was
very
gritty
again
,
and
everything
had
a
strange
and
an
uncomfortable
appearance
of
seeming
to
wait
for
something
that
would
n't
come
.
 
<EOS>
NO
.
 
<EOS>
She
began
to
think
,
that
,
now
the
Cloisterham
school
-
days
had
glided
past
and
gone
,
the
gritty
stages
would
begin
to
set
in
at
intervals
and
make
themselves
wearily
known
!
   
<EOS>
Yet
what
did
Rosa
expect
?
 
<EOS>
Did
she
expect
Miss
Twinkleton
?
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
duly
came
.
 
<EOS>
Forth
from
her
back
parlour
issued
the
Billickin
to
receive
Miss
Twinkleton
,
and
War
was
in
the
Billickin
's
eye
from
that
fell
moment
.
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
brought
a
quantity
of
luggage
with
her
,
having
all
Rosa
's
as
well
as
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
Billickin
took
it
ill
that
Miss
Twinkleton
's
mind
,
being
sorely
disturbed
by
this
luggage
,
failed
to
take
in
her
personal
identity
with
that
clearness
of
perception
which
was
due
to
its
demands
.
 
<EOS>
Stateliness
mounted
her
gloomy
throne
upon
the
Billickin
's
brow
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
Miss
Twinkleton
,
in
agitation
taking
stock
of
her
trunks
and
packages
,
of
which
she
had
seventeen
,
particularly
counted
in
the
Billickin
herself
as
number
eleven
,
the
B
found
it
necessary
to
repudiate
.
   
<EOS>
"
Things
can
not
too
soon
be
put
upon
the
footing
,
"
said
she
,
with
a
candour
so
demonstrative
as
to
be
almost
obtrusive
,
"
that
the
person
of
the
'
ouse
is
not
a
box
nor
yet
a
bundle
,
nor
a
carpet
-
bag
.
 
<EOS>
No
,
I
am
'
ily
obleeged
to
you
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
nor
yet
a
beggar
.
"
   
<EOS>
This
last
disclaimer
had
reference
to
Miss
Twinkleton
's
distractedly
pressing
two
-
and
-
sixpence
on
her
,
instead
of
the
cabman
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
cast
off
,
Miss
Twinkleton
wildly
inquired
,
"
which
gentleman
"
was
to
be
paid
?
 
<EOS>
There
being
two
gentlemen
in
that
position
<EOS>
(
Miss
Twinkleton
having
arrived
with
two
cabs
)
,
each
gentleman
on
being
paid
held
forth
his
two
-
and
-
sixpence
on
the
flat
of
his
open
hand
,
and
,
with
a
speechless
stare
and
a
dropped
jaw
,
displayed
his
wrong
to
heaven
and
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Terrified
by
this
alarming
spectacle
,
Miss
Twinkleton
placed
another
shilling
in
each
hand
;
at
the
same
time
appealing
to
the
law
in
flurried
accents
,
and
recounting
her
luggage
this
time
with
the
two
gentlemen
in
,
who
caused
the
total
to
come
out
complicated
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
two
gentlemen
,
each
looking
very
hard
at
the
last
shilling
grumblingly
,
as
if
it
might
become
eighteen
-
pence
if
he
kept
his
eyes
on
it
,
descended
the
doorsteps
,
ascended
their
carriages
,
and
drove
away
,
leaving
Miss
Twinkleton
on
a
bonnet
-
box
in
tears
.
   
<EOS>
The
Billickin
beheld
this
manifestation
of
weakness
without
sympathy
,
and
gave
directions
for
"
a
young
man
to
be
got
in
"
to
wrestle
with
the
luggage
.
 
<EOS>
When
that
gladiator
had
disappeared
from
the
arena
,
peace
ensued
,
and
the
new
lodgers
dined
.
   
<EOS>
But
the
Billickin
had
somehow
come
to
the
knowledge
that
Miss
Twinkleton
kept
a
school
.
 
<EOS>
The
leap
from
that
knowledge
to
the
inference
that
Miss
Twinkleton
set
herself
to
teach
HER
something
,
was
easy
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
do
it
,
"
soliloquised
the
Billickin
;
"
I
am
not
your
pupil
,
<EOS>
whatever
she
,
"
meaning
Rosa
,
"
may
be
,
poor
thing
!
"
   
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
,
on
the
other
hand
,
having
changed
her
dress
and
recovered
her
spirits
,
was
animated
by
a
bland
desire
to
improve
the
occasion
in
all
ways
,
and
to
be
as
serene
a
model
as
possible
.
<EOS>
In
a
happy
compromise
between
her
two
states
of
existence
,
she
had
already
become
,
with
her
workbasket
before
her
,
the
equably
vivacious
companion
with
a
slight
judicious
flavouring
of
information
,
when
the
Billickin
announced
herself
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
hide
from
you
,
ladies
,
"
said
the
B
,
enveloped
in
the
shawl
of
state
,
"
<EOS>
for
it
is
not
my
character
to
hide
neither
my
motives
nor
my
actions
,
that
I
take
the
liberty
to
look
in
upon
you
to
express
a
'
ope
that
your
dinner
was
to
your
liking
.
 
<EOS>
Though
not
Professed
but
<EOS>
Plain
,
still
her
wages
should
be
a
sufficient
object
to
her
to
stimilate
to
soar
above
mere
roast
and
biled
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
dined
very
well
indeed
,
"
said
Rosa
,
"
thank
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Accustomed
,
"
said
Miss
Twinkleton
with
a
gracious
air
,
which
to
the
jealous
ears
of
the
Billickin
seemed
to
add
"
my
good
woman
"
---
"
accustomed
to
a
liberal
and
nutritious
,
yet
plain
and
salutary
diet
,
we
have
found
no
reason
to
bemoan
our
absence
from
the
ancient
city
,
and
the
methodical
household
,
in
which
the
quiet
routine
of
our
lot
has
been
hitherto
cast
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
think
it
well
to
mention
to
my
cook
,
"
observed
the
Billickin
with
a
gush
of
candour
,
"
which
I
'
ope
<EOS>
you
will
agree
with
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
was
a
right
precaution
,
that
the
young
lady
being
used
to
what
we
should
consider
here
but
<EOS>
poor
diet
,
had
better
be
brought
forward
by
degrees
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
a
rush
from
scanty
feeding
to
generous
feeding
,
and
from
what
you
may
call
messing
to
what
you
may
call
method
,
do
require
a
power
of
constitution
which
is
not
often
found
in
youth
,
particular
when
undermined
by
boarding
-
school
!
"
   
<EOS>
It
will
be
seen
that
the
Billickin
now
openly
pitted
herself
against
Miss
Twinkleton
,
as
one
whom
she
had
fully
ascertained
to
be
her
natural
enemy
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
remarks
,
"
returned
Miss
Twinkleton
,
from
a
remote
moral
eminence
,
"
are
well
meant
,
I
have
no
doubt
;
but
you
will
permit
me
to
observe
that
they
develop
a
mistaken
view
of
the
subject
,
which
can
only
be
imputed
to
your
extreme
want
of
accurate
information
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
My
informiation
,
"
retorted
the
Billickin
,
throwing
in
an
extra
syllable
for
the
sake
of
emphasis
at
once
polite
and
powerful
---
"
my
informiation
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
were
my
own
experience
,
which
I
believe
is
usually
considered
to
be
good
guidance
.
 
<EOS>
But
whether
so
or
not
,
I
was
put
in
youth
to
a
very
genteel
boarding
-
school
,
the
mistress
being
no
less

yourself

of
about
your
own
age
or
it
may
be
some
years
younger

and
a
poorness
of
blood
flowed
from
the
table
which
has
run
through
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Very
likely
,
"
said
Miss
Twinkleton
,
still
from
her
distant
eminence
;
"
and
very
much
to
be
deplored
.
<EOS>
---
Rosa
,
my
dear
,
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
work
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Miss
Twinkleton
,
"
resumed
the
Billickin
,
in
a
courtly
manner
,
"
before
retiring
on
the
'
int
,
as
a
lady
should
,
I
wish
to
ask
of
yourself
,
as
a
lady
,
whether
I
am
to
consider
that
my
words
is
doubted
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
aware
on
what
ground
<EOS>
you
cherish
such
a
supposition
,
"
began
Miss
Twinkleton
,
when
the
Billickin
neatly
stopped
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
Do
not
,
if
you
please
,
put
suppositions
betwixt
my
lips
where
none
such
have
been
imparted
by
myself
.
 
<EOS>
Your
flow
of
words
is
great
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
and
no
doubt
is
expected
from
you
by
your
pupils
,
and
no
doubt
is
considered
worth
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
NO
doubt
,
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
But
not
paying
for
flows
of
words
,
and
not
asking
to
be
favoured
with
them
here
,
I
wish
to
repeat
my
question
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
refer
to
the
poverty
of
your
circulation
,
"
began
Miss
Twinkleton
,
when
again
the
Billickin
neatly
stopped
her
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
used
no
such
expressions
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
If
you
refer
,
then
,
to
the
poorness
of
your
blood
---
"
   
"
Brought
upon
me
,
"
stipulated
the
Billickin
,
expressly
,
"
at
a
boarding
-
school
---
"
   
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
resumed
Miss
Twinkleton
,
"
all
I
can
say
is
,
that
I
am
bound
to
believe
,
on
your
asseveration
,
that
it
is
very
poor
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
forbear
adding
,
that
if
that
unfortunate
circumstance
influences
your
conversation
,
it
is
much
to
be
lamented
,
and
it
is
eminently
desirable
that
your
blood
were
richer
.
<EOS>
---
Rosa
,
my
dear
,
how
are
you
getting
on
with
your
work
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Hem
!
 
<EOS>
Before
retiring
,
Miss
,
"
proclaimed
the
Billickin
to
Rosa
,
loftily
cancelling
Miss
Twinkleton
,
"
I
should
wish
it
to
be
understood
between
yourself
and
me
that
my
transactions
in
future
is
with
you
alone
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
no
elderly
lady
here
,
Miss
,
none
older
than
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
highly
desirable
arrangement
,
Rosa
my
dear
,
"
observed
Miss
Twinkleton
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
,
Miss
,
"
said
the
Billickin
,
with
a
sarcastic
smile
,
"
that
I
possess
the
Mill
I
have
heard
of
,
in
which
old
single
ladies
could
be
ground
up
young
<EOS>
(
what
a
gift
it
would
be
to
some
of
us
)
,
but
that
I
limit
myself
to
you
totally
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
I
have
any
desire
to
communicate
a
request
to
the
person
of
the
house
,
Rosa
my
dear
,
"
observed
Miss
Twinkleton
with
majestic
cheerfulness
,
"
I
will
make
it
known
to
you
,
and
you
will
kindly
undertake
,
I
am
sure
,
that
it
is
conveyed
to
the
proper
quarter
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Good
-
evening
,
Miss
,
"
said
the
Billickin
,
at
once
affectionately
and
distantly
.
 
<EOS>
"
Being
alone
in
my
eyes
,
I
wish
you
good
-
evening
with
best
wishes
,
and
do
not
find
myself
drove
,
I
am
truly
'
appy
to
say
,
into
expressing
my
contempt
for
an
indiwidual
,
unfortunately
for
yourself
,
belonging
to
you
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
Billickin
gracefully
withdrew
with
this
parting
speech
,
and
from
that
time
Rosa
occupied
the
restless
position
of
shuttlecock
between
these
two
battledores
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
done
without
a
smart
match
being
played
out
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
on
the
daily
-
arising
question
of
dinner
,
Miss
Twinkleton
would
say
,
the
three
being
present
together
:
   
"
Perhaps
,
my
love
,
you
will
consult
with
the
person
of
the
house
,
whether
she
can
procure
us
a
lamb
's
fry
;
or
,
failing
that
,
a
roast
fowl
.
"
   
<EOS>
On
which
the
Billickin
would
retort
(
Rosa
not
having
spoken
a
word
)
,
"
If
you
was
better
accustomed
to
butcher
's
meat
,
Miss
,
you
would
not
entertain
the
idea
of
a
lamb
's
fry
.
 
<EOS>
Firstly
,
because
lambs
has
long
been
sheep
,
and
secondly
,
because
there
is
such
things
as
killing
-
days
,
and
there
is
not
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
roast
fowls
,
Miss
,
why
you
must
be
quite
surfeited
with
roast
fowls
,
letting
alone
your
buying
,
when
you
market
for
yourself
,
the
agedest
of
poultry
with
the
scaliest
of
legs
,
quite
as
if
you
was
accustomed
to
picking
'em
out
for
cheapness
.
 
<EOS>
Try
a
little
inwention
,
<EOS>
Miss.
 
Use
yourself
to
'
ousekeeping
a
bit
.
 
<EOS>
Come
now
,
think
of
somethink
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
To
this
encouragement
,
offered
with
the
indulgent
toleration
of
a
wise
and
liberal
expert
,
Miss
Twinkleton
would
rejoin
,
reddening
:
   
"
<EOS>
Or
,
my
dear
,
you
might
propose
to
the
person
of
the
house
a
duck
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Miss
!
"
the
Billickin
would
exclaim
(
still
no
word
being
spoken
by
Rosa
)
,
"
you
do
surprise
me
when
you
speak
of
ducks
!
 
<EOS>
Not
to
mention
that
they
're
getting
out
of
season
and
very
dear
,
it
really
strikes
to
my
heart
to
see
you
have
a
duck
;
for
the
breast
,
which
is
the
only
delicate
cuts
in
a
duck
,
always
goes
in
a
direction
which
I
can
not
imagine
where
,
and
your
own
plate
comes
down
so
miserably
skin
-
and
-
bony
!
 
<EOS>
Try
again
,
<EOS>
Miss.
 
Think
more
of
yourself
,
and
less
of
others
.
 
<EOS>
A
dish
of
sweetbreads
now
,
or
a
bit
of
mutton
.
 
<EOS>
Something
at
which
you
can
get
your
equal
chance
.
"
   
<EOS>
Occasionally
the
game
would
wax
very
brisk
indeed
,
and
would
be
kept
up
with
a
smartness
rendering
such
an
encounter
as
this
quite
tame
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Billickin
almost
invariably
made
by
far
the
higher
score
;
and
would
come
in
with
side
hits
of
the
most
unexpected
and
extraordinary
description
,
when
she
seemed
without
a
chance
.
   
<EOS>
All
this
did
not
improve
the
gritty
state
of
things
in
London
,
or
the
air
that
London
had
acquired
in
Rosa
's
eyes
of
waiting
for
something
that
never
came
.
 
<EOS>
Tired
of
working
,
and
conversing
with
Miss
Twinkleton
<EOS>
,
she
suggested
working
and
reading
:
 
to
which
Miss
Twinkleton
readily
assented
,
as
an
admirable
reader
,
of
tried
powers
.
 
<EOS>
But
Rosa
soon
made
the
discovery
that
Miss
Twinkleton
did
n't
read
fairly
.
 
<EOS>
She
cut
the
love
-
scenes
,
interpolated
passages
in
praise
of
female
celibacy
,
and
was
guilty
of
other
glaring
pious
frauds
.
 
<EOS>
As
an
instance
in
point
,
take
the
glowing
passage
:
 
"
Ever
dearest
and
best
adored
,
---
said
Edward
,
clasping
the
dear
head
to
his
breast
,
and
drawing
the
silken
hair
through
his
caressing
fingers
,
from
which
he
suffered
it
to
fall
like
golden
rain
,
---
ever
dearest
and
best
adored
,
let
us
fly
from
the
unsympathetic
world
and
the
sterile
coldness
of
the
stony
-
hearted
,
to
the
rich
warm
Paradise
of
Trust
and
Love
.
"
 
<EOS>
Miss
Twinkleton
's
fraudulent
version
tamely
ran
thus
:
 
"
Ever
engaged
to
me
with
the
consent
of
our
parents
on
both
sides
,
and
the
approbation
of
the
silver
-
haired
rector
of
the
district
,
---
said
Edward
,
respectfully
raising
to
his
lips
the
taper
fingers
so
skilful
in
embroidery
,
tambour
,
crochet
,
and
other
truly
feminine
arts
,
---
let
me
call
on
thy
papa
ere
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
's
dawn
has
sunk
into
the
west
,
and
propose
a
suburban
establishment
,
lowly
it
may
be
,
but
within
our
means
,
where
he
will
be
always
welcome
as
an
evening
guest
,
and
where
every
arrangement
shall
invest
economy
,
and
constant
interchange
of
scholastic
acquirements
with
the
attributes
of
the
ministering
angel
to
domestic
bliss
.
"
   
<EOS>
As
the
days
crept
on
and
nothing
happened
,
the
neighbours
began
to
say
that
the
pretty
girl
at
Billickin
's
,
who
looked
so
wistfully
<EOS>
and
so
much
out
of
the
gritty
windows
of
the
drawing
-
room
,
seemed
to
be
losing
her
spirits
.
 
<EOS>
The
pretty
girl
might
have
lost
them
but
for
the
accident
of
lighting
on
some
books
of
voyages
and
sea
-
adventure
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
compensation
against
their
romance
,
Miss
Twinkleton
,
reading
aloud
,
made
the
most
of
all
the
latitudes
and
longitudes
,
bearings
,
winds
,
currents
,
offsets
,
and
other
statistics
(
which
she
felt
to
be
none
the
less
improving
because
they
expressed
nothing
whatever
to
her
)
;
while
Rosa
,
listening
intently
,
made
the
most
of
what
was
nearest
to
her
heart
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
both
did
better
than
before
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
23
.
<EOS>
The
dawn
again
 
<EOS>
Although
Mr
Crisparkle
and
John
Jasper
met
daily
under
the
Cathedral
roof
,
nothing
at
any
time
passed
between
them
having
reference
to
Edwin
Drood
,
after
the
time
,
more
than
half
a
year
gone
by
,
when
Jasper
mutely
showed
the
Minor
Canon
the
conclusion
and
the
resolution
entered
in
his
Diary
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
that
they
ever
met
,
though
so
often
,
without
the
thoughts
of
each
reverting
to
the
subject
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
likely
that
they
ever
met
,
though
so
often
,
without
a
sensation
on
the
part
of
each
that
the
other
was
a
perplexing
secret
to
him
.
<EOS>
Jasper
as
the
denouncer
and
pursuer
of
Neville
Landless
,
and
Mr
Crisparkle
as
his
consistent
advocate
and
protector
,
must
at
least
have
stood
sufficiently
in
opposition
to
have
speculated
with
keen
interest
on
the
steadiness
and
next
direction
of
the
other
's
designs
.
 
<EOS>
But
neither
ever
broached
the
theme
.
   
<EOS>
False
pretence
not
being
in
the
Minor
Canon
's
nature
,
he
doubtless
displayed
openly
that
he
would
at
any
time
have
revived
the
subject
,
and
even
desired
to
discuss
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
determined
reticence
of
Jasper
,
however
,
was
not
to
be
so
approached
.
 
<EOS>
Impassive
,
moody
,
solitary
,
resolute
,
so
concentrated
on
one
idea
,
and
on
its
attendant
fixed
purpose
,
that
he
would
share
it
with
no
fellow
-
creature
<EOS>
,
he
lived
apart
from
human
life
.
 
<EOS>
Constantly
exercising
an
Art
which
brought
him
into
mechanical
harmony
with
others
,
and
which
could
not
have
been
pursued
unless
he
and
they
had
been
in
the
nicest
mechanical
relations
and
unison
,
it
is
curious
to
consider
that
the
spirit
of
the
man
was
in
moral
accordance
or
interchange
with
nothing
around
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
indeed
he
had
confided
to
his
lost
nephew
,
before
the
occasion
for
his
present
inflexibility
arose
.
   
<EOS>
That
he
must
know
of
Rosa
's
abrupt
departure
,
and
that
he
must
divine
its
cause
,
was
not
to
be
doubted
.
 
<EOS>
Did
he
suppose
that
he
had
terrified
her
into
silence
?
<EOS>
or
did
he
suppose
that
she
had
imparted
to
any
one
---
to
Mr
Crisparkle
himself
,
for
instance
---
the
particulars
of
his
last
interview
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
Mr
Crisparkle
could
not
determine
this
in
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
but
admit
,
however
,
as
a
just
man
,
that
it
was
not
,
of
itself
,
a
crime
to
fall
in
love
with
Rosa
,
any
more
than
it
was
a
crime
to
offer
to
set
love
above
revenge
.
   
<EOS>
The
dreadful
suspicion
of
Jasper
,
which
Rosa
was
so
shocked
to
have
received
into
her
imagination
,
appeared
to
have
no
harbour
in
Mr
Crisparkle
's
.
 
<EOS>
If
it
ever
haunted
Helena
's
thoughts
or
Neville
's
,
neither
gave
it
one
spoken
word
of
utterance
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Grewgious
took
no
pains
to
conceal
his
implacable
dislike
of
Jasper
,
yet
he
never
referred
it
,
however
distantly
,
to
such
a
source
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
reticent
as
well
as
an
eccentric
man
;
and
he
made
no
mention
of
a
certain
evening
when
he
warmed
his
hands
at
the
gatehouse
fire
,
and
looked
steadily
down
upon
a
certain
heap
of
torn
and
miry
clothes
upon
the
floor
.
   
<EOS>
Drowsy
Cloisterham
,
whenever
it
awoke
to
a
passing
reconsideration
of
a
story
above
six
months
old
and
dismissed
by
the
bench
of
magistrates
,
was
pretty
equally
divided
in
opinion
whether
John
Jasper
's
beloved
nephew
had
been
killed
by
his
treacherously
passionate
rival
,
or
in
an
open
struggle
;
or
had
,
for
his
own
purposes
,
spirited
himself
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
then
lifted
up
its
head
,
to
notice
that
the
bereaved
Jasper
was
still
ever
devoted
to
discovery
and
revenge
;
and
then
dozed
off
again
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
condition
of
matters
,
all
round
,
at
the
period
to
which
the
present
history
has
now
attained
.
   
<EOS>
The
Cathedral
doors
have
closed
for
the
night
;
and
the
Choir
-
master
,
on
a
short
leave
of
absence
for
two
or
three
services
,
sets
his
face
towards
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
travels
thither
by
the
means
by
which
Rosa
travelled
,
and
arrives
,
as
Rosa
arrived
,
on
a
hot
,
dusty
evening
.
   
<EOS>
His
travelling
baggage
is
easily
carried
in
his
hand
,
and
he
repairs
with
it
on
foot
,
to
a
hybrid
hotel
in
a
little
square
behind
Aldersgate
Street
,
near
the
General
Post
Office
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
hotel
,
boarding
-
house
,
or
lodging
-
house
,
at
its
visitor
's
option
.
<EOS>
It
announces
itself
,
in
the
new
Railway
Advertisers
,
as
a
novel
enterprise
,
timidly
beginning
to
spring
up
.
 
<EOS>
It
bashfully
,
almost
apologetically
,
gives
the
traveller
to
understand
that
it
does
not
expect
him
,
on
the
good
old
constitutional
hotel
plan
,
to
order
a
pint
of
sweet
blacking
for
his
drinking
,
and
throw
it
away
;
but
insinuates
that
he
may
have
his
boots
blacked
instead
of
his
stomach
,
and
maybe
also
have
bed
,
breakfast
,
attendance
,
and
a
porter
up
all
night
,
for
a
certain
fixed
charge
.
 
<EOS>
From
these
and
similar
premises
,
many
true
Britons
in
the
lowest
spirits
deduce
that
the
times
are
levelling
times
,
except
in
the
article
of
high
roads
,
of
which
there
will
shortly
be
not
one
in
England
.
   
<EOS>
He
eats
without
appetite
,
and
soon
goes
forth
again
.
 
<EOS>
Eastward
and
still
eastward
through
the
stale
streets
he
takes
his
way
,
until
he
reaches
his
destination
:
 
a
miserable
court
,
specially
miserable
among
many
such
.
   
<EOS>
He
ascends
a
broken
staircase
,
opens
a
door
,
looks
into
a
dark
stifling
room
,
and
says
:
 
"
Are
you
alone
here
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Alone
,
deary
;
worse
luck
for
me
,
and
better
for
you
,
"
replies
a
croaking
voice
.
 
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
come
in
,
whoever
you
be
:
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
see
you
till
I
light
a
match
,
yet
I
seem
to
know
the
sound
of
your
speaking
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
acquainted
with
you
,
ai
n't
I
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Light
your
match
,
and
try
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
I
will
,
deary
,
so
I
will
;
but
my
hand
that
shakes
,
as
I
ca
n't
lay
it
on
a
match
all
in
a
moment
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
cough
so
,
<EOS>
that
,
put
my
matches
where
I
may
,
I
never
find
'em
there
.
 
<EOS>
They
jump
and
start
,
as
I
cough
and
cough
,
like
live
things
.
 
<EOS>
Are
you
off
a
voyage
,
deary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Not
seafaring
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Well
,
there
's
land
customers
,
and
there
's
water
customers
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
a
mother
to
both
.
 
<EOS>
Different
from
Jack
Chinaman
t'other
side
the
court
.
 
<EOS>
He
ai
n't
a
father
to
neither
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
ai
n't
got
the
true
secret
of
mixing
,
though
he
charges
as
much
as
me
that
has
,
and
more
if
he
can
get
it
.
 
<EOS>
Here
's
a
match
,
and
now
where
's
the
candle
?
 
<EOS>
If
my
cough
takes
me
,
I
shall
cough
out
twenty
matches
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
I
gets
a
light
.
"
   
<EOS>
But
she
finds
the
candle
,
and
lights
it
,
before
the
cough
comes
on
.
<EOS>
It
seizes
her
in
the
moment
of
success
,
and
she
sits
down
rocking
herself
to
and
fro
,
and
gasping
at
intervals
:
 
<EOS>
"
O
,
my
lungs
is
awful
bad
!
<EOS>
my
lungs
is
wore
away
to
cabbage
-
nets
!
"
<EOS>
until
the
fit
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
During
its
continuance
she
has
had
no
power
of
sight
,
or
any
other
power
not
absorbed
in
the
struggle
;
but
as
it
leaves
her
,
she
begins
to
strain
her
eyes
,
and
as
soon
as
she
is
able
to
articulate
,
she
cries
,
staring
:
   
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
's
you
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Are
you
so
surprised
to
see
me
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
never
should
have
seen
you
again
,
deary
.
 
<EOS>
I
thought
you
was
dead
,
and
gone
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
suppose
you
could
have
kept
away
,
alive
,
so
long
,
from
the
poor
old
soul
with
the
real
receipt
for
mixing
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
are
in
mourning
too
!
 
<EOS>
Why
did
n't
you
come
and
have
a
pipe
or
two
of
comfort
?
 
<EOS>
Did
they
leave
you
money
,
perhaps
,
and
so
you
did
n't
want
comfort
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Who
was
they
as
died
,
deary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
relative
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Died
of
what
,
lovey
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
Death
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
We
are
short
to
-
night
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
woman
,
with
a
propitiatory
laugh
.
 
<EOS>
"
Short
and
snappish
we
are
!
 
<EOS>
But
we
're
out
of
sorts
for
want
of
a
smoke
.
 
<EOS>
We
've
got
the
all
-
overs
,
have
n't
us
,
deary
?
 
<EOS>
But
this
is
the
place
to
cure
'em
in
;
this
is
the
place
where
the
all
-
overs
is
smoked
off
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
ready
,
then
,
"
replies
the
visitor
,
"
as
soon
as
you
like
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
divests
himself
of
his
shoes
,
loosens
his
cravat
,
and
lies
across
the
foot
of
the
squalid
bed
,
with
his
head
resting
on
his
left
hand
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
you
begin
to
look
like
yourself
,
"
says
the
woman
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
begin
to
know
my
old
customer
indeed
!
 
<EOS>
Been
trying
to
mix
for
yourself
this
long
time
,
poppet
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
taking
it
now
<EOS>
and
then
in
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Never
take
it
your
own
way
.
 
<EOS>
It
ai
n't
good
for
trade
,
and
it
ai
n't
good
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
Where
's
my
ink
-
bottle
,
and
where
's
my
thimble
,
and
where
's
my
little
spoon
?
 
<EOS>
He
's
going
to
take
it
in
a
artful
form
now
,
my
deary
dear
!
"
   
<EOS>
Entering
on
her
process
,
and
beginning
to
bubble
and
blow
at
the
faint
spark
enclosed
in
the
hollow
of
her
hands
,
she
speaks
from
time
to
time
,
in
a
tone
of
snuffling
satisfaction
,
without
leaving
off
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
speaks
,
he
does
so
without
looking
at
her
,
and
as
if
his
thoughts
were
already
roaming
away
by
anticipation
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
pretty
many
smokes
ready
for
you
,
first
and
last
,
have
n't
I
,
chuckey
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
A
good
many
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
When
you
first
come
,
you
was
quite
new
to
it
;
warn't
ye
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
was
easily
disposed
of
,
then
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
you
got
on
in
the
world
,
and
was
able
by
-
and
-
by
to
take
your
pipe
with
the
best
of
'em
,
warn't
ye
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ah
;
and
the
worst
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
ready
for
you
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
sweet
singer
you
was
when
you
first
come
!
 
<EOS>
Used
to
drop
your
head
,
and
sing
yourself
off
like
a
bird
!
 
<EOS>
It
's
ready
for
you
now
,
deary
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
takes
it
from
her
with
great
care
,
and
puts
the
mouthpiece
to
his
lips
.
 
<EOS>
She
seats
herself
beside
him
,
ready
to
refill
the
pipe
.
   
<EOS>
After
inhaling
a
few
whiffs
in
silence
,
he
doubtingly
accosts
her
with
:
   
"
<EOS>
Is
it
as
potent
as
it
used
to
be
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
speak
of
,
deary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
should
I
speak
of
,
but
what
I
have
in
my
mouth
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
just
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Always
the
identical
same
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
does
n't
taste
so
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
slower
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
more
used
to
it
,
you
see
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
may
be
the
cause
,
certainly
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
stops
,
becomes
dreamy
,
and
seems
to
forget
that
he
has
invited
her
attention
.
 
<EOS>
She
bends
over
him
,
and
speaks
in
his
ear
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'm
attending
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
Says
you
just
now
,
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
Says
I
now
,
I
'm
attending
to
ye
.
 
<EOS>
We
was
talking
just
before
of
your
being
used
to
it
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
know
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
only
thinking
.
 
<EOS>
Look
here
.
 
<EOS>
Suppose
you
had
something
in
your
mind
;
something
you
were
going
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
deary
;
something
I
was
going
to
do
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
But
had
not
quite
determined
to
do
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Might
or
might
not
do
,
you
understand
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
.
"
 
<EOS>
With
the
point
of
a
needle
she
stirs
the
contents
of
the
bowl
.
   
<EOS>
"
Should
you
do
it
in
your
fancy
,
when
you
were
lying
here
doing
this
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
nods
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
"
Over
and
over
again
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Just
like
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
done
it
hundreds
of
thousands
of
times
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
to
be
hoped
it
was
pleasant
to
do
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
It
WAS
pleasant
to
do
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
says
this
with
a
savage
air
,
and
a
spring
or
start
at
her
.
<EOS>
Quite
unmoved
<EOS>
she
retouches
and
replenishes
the
contents
of
the
bowl
with
her
little
spatula
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
her
intent
upon
the
occupation
,
he
sinks
into
his
former
attitude
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
journey
,
a
difficult
and
dangerous
journey
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
subject
in
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
A
hazardous
and
perilous
journey
,
over
abysses
where
a
slip
would
be
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
Look
down
,
look
down
!
 
<EOS>
You
see
what
lies
at
the
bottom
there
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
has
darted
forward
to
say
it
,
and
to
point
at
the
ground
,
as
though
at
some
imaginary
object
far
beneath
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
looks
at
him
,
as
his
spasmodic
face
approaches
close
to
hers
,
and
not
at
his
pointing
.
 
<EOS>
She
seems
to
know
what
the
influence
of
her
perfect
quietude
would
be
;
if
so
,
she
has
not
miscalculated
it
,
for
he
subsides
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
I
have
told
you
I
did
it
here
hundreds
of
thousands
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
I
say
?
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
millions
and
billions
of
times
.
 
<EOS>
I
did
it
so
often
,
and
through
such
vast
expanses
of
time
,
that
when
it
was
really
done
,
it
seemed
not
worth
the
doing
,
it
was
done
so
soon
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
journey
you
have
been
away
upon
,
"
she
quietly
remarks
.
   
<EOS>
He
glares
at
her
as
he
smokes
;
and
then
,
his
eyes
becoming
filmy
,
answers
:
 
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
journey
.
"
   
<EOS>
Silence
ensues
.
 
<EOS>
His
eyes
are
sometimes
closed
and
sometimes
open
.
<EOS>
The
woman
sits
beside
him
,
very
attentive
to
the
pipe
,
which
is
all
the
while
at
his
lips
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
warrant
,
"
she
observes
,
when
he
has
been
looking
fixedly
at
her
for
some
consecutive
moments
,
with
a
singular
appearance
in
his
eyes
of
seeming
to
see
her
a
long
way
off
,
instead
of
so
near
him
:
"
I
'll
warrant
you
made
the
journey
in
a
many
ways
,
when
you
made
it
so
often
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
No
,
always
in
one
way
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Always
in
the
same
way
?
"
   
"
Ay
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
In
the
way
in
which
it
was
really
made
at
last
?
"
   
"
Ay
.
"
   
"
And
always
took
the
same
pleasure
in
harping
on
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
.
"
   
<EOS>
For
the
time
he
appears
unequal
to
any
other
reply
than
this
lazy
monosyllabic
assent
.
 
<EOS>
Probably
to
assure
herself
that
it
is
not
the
assent
of
a
mere
automaton
,
she
reverses
the
form
of
her
next
sentence
.
   
<EOS>
"
Did
you
never
get
tired
of
it
,
deary
,
and
try
to
call
up
something
else
for
a
change
?
"
   
<EOS>
He
struggles
into
a
sitting
posture
,
and
retorts
upon
her
:
 
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
 
<EOS>
What
did
I
want
?
 
<EOS>
What
did
I
come
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
gently
lays
him
back
again
,
and
before
returning
him
the
instrument
he
has
dropped
,
revives
the
fire
in
it
with
her
own
breath
;
then
says
to
him
,
coaxingly
:
   
<EOS>
"
Sure
,
sure
,
sure
!
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
yes
!
 
<EOS>
Now
I
go
along
with
you
.
 
<EOS>
You
was
too
quick
for
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
now
.
 
<EOS>
You
come
o
'
purpose
to
take
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
Why
,
I
might
have
known
it
,
through
its
standing
by
you
so
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
answers
first
with
a
laugh
,
and
then
with
a
passionate
setting
of
his
teeth
:
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
came
on
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
could
not
bear
my
life
,
I
came
to
get
the
relief
,
and
I
got
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
WAS
one
!
 
<EOS>
It
WAS
one
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
repetition
with
extraordinary
vehemence
,
and
the
snarl
of
a
wolf
.
   
<EOS>
She
observes
him
very
cautiously
,
as
though
mentally
feeling
her
way
to
her
next
remark
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
:
 
"
There
was
a
fellow
-
traveller
,
deary
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
breaks
into
a
ringing
laugh
,
or
rather
yell
.
   
<EOS>
"
To

,
"
he
cries
,
"
how
often
fellow
-
traveller
,
and
yet
not
know
it
!
 
<EOS>
To
think
how
many
times
he
went
the
journey
,
and
never
saw
the
road
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
kneels
upon
the
floor
,
with
her
arms
crossed
on
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
,
close
by
him
,
and
her
chin
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
crouching
attitude
she
watches
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
pipe
is
falling
from
his
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
She
puts
it
back
,
and
laying
her
hand
upon
his
chest
,
moves
him
slightly
from
side
to
side
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
he
speaks
,
as
if
she
had
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
!
 
<EOS>
I
always
made
the
journey
first
,
before
the
changes
of
colours
and
the
great
landscapes
and
glittering
processions
began
.
<EOS>
They
could
n't
begin
till
it
was
off
my
mind
.
 
<EOS>
I
had
no
room
till
then
for
anything
else
.
"
   
<EOS>
Once
more
he
lapses
into
silence
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
she
lays
her
hand
upon
his
chest
,
and
moves
him
slightly
to
and
fro
,
as
a
cat
might
stimulate
a
half
-
slain
mouse
.
 
<EOS>
Once
more
he
speaks
,
as
if
she
had
spoken
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
?
 
<EOS>
I
told
you
so
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
comes
to
be
real
at
last
,
it
is
so
short
that
it
seems
unreal
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
Hark
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
deary
.
 
<EOS>
I
'm
listening
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Time
and
place
are
both
at
hand
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
is
on
his
feet
,
speaking
in
a
whisper
,
and
as
if
in
the
dark
.
   
<EOS>
"
Time
,
place
,
and
fellow
-
traveller
,
"
she
suggests
,
adopting
his
tone
,
and
holding
him
softly
by
the
arm
.
   
<EOS>
"
How
could
the
time
be
at
hand
unless
the
fellow
-
traveller
was
?
<EOS>
Hush
!
 
<EOS>
The
journey
's
made
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
So
soon
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
what
I
said
to
you
.
 
<EOS>
So
soon
.
 
<EOS>
Wait
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
vision
.
 
<EOS>
I
shall
sleep
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
too
short
and
easy
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
a
better
vision
than
this
;
this
is
the
poorest
of
all
.
<EOS>
No
struggle
,
no
consciousness
of
peril
,
no
entreaty
---
and
yet
I
never
saw
THAT
before
.
"
 
With
a
start
.
   
<EOS>
"
Saw
what
,
deary
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Look
at
it
!
 
<EOS>
Look
what
a
poor
,
mean
,
miserable
thing
it
is
!
 
<EOS>
THAT
must
be
real
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
over
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
has
accompanied
this
incoherence
with
some
wild
unmeaning
gestures
;
but
they
trail
off
into
the
progressive
inaction
of
stupor
,
and
he
lies
a
log
upon
the
bed
.
   
<EOS>
The
woman
,
however
,
is
still
inquisitive
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
repetition
of
her
cat
-
like
action
she
slightly
stirs
his
body
again
,
and
listens
;
stirs
again
,
and
listens
;
whispers
to
it
,
and
listens
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
it
past
all
rousing
for
the
time
,
she
slowly
gets
upon
her
feet
,
with
an
air
of
disappointment
,
and
flicks
the
face
with
the
back
of
her
hand
in
turning
from
it
.
   
<EOS>
But
she
goes
no
further
away
from
it
than
the
chair
upon
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
She
sits
in
it
,
with
an
elbow
on
one
of
its
arms
,
and
her
chin
upon
her
hand
,
intent
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
heard
ye
say
once
<EOS>
,
"
she
croaks
under
her
breath
,
"
I
heard
ye
say
once
,
when
I
was
lying
where
you
're
lying
,
and
you
were
making
your
speculations
upon
me
,
"
Unintelligible
!
"
 
<EOS>
I
heard
you
say
so
,
of
two
more
than
me
.
 
<EOS>
But
do
n't
ye
be
too
sure
always
<EOS>
;
do
n't
be
ye
too
sure
,
beauty
!
"
   
<EOS>
Unwinking
,
cat
-
like
,
and
intent
<EOS>
,
she
presently
adds
:
 
"
Not
so
potent
as
it
once
was
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
not
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
more
right
there
.
 
<EOS>
Practice
makes
perfect
.
 
<EOS>
I
may
have
learned
the
secret
how
to
make
ye
talk
,
deary
.
"
   
<EOS>
He
talks
no
more
,
whether
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
Twitching
in
an
ugly
way
from
time
to
time
,
both
as
to
his
face
and
limbs
,
he
lies
heavy
and
silent
.
 
<EOS>
The
wretched
candle
burns
down
;
the
woman
takes
its
expiring
end
between
her
fingers
,
lights
another
at
it
,
crams
the
guttering
frying
morsel
deep
into
the
candlestick
,
and
rams
it
home
with
the
new
candle
,
as
if
she
were
loading
some
ill
-
savoured
and
unseemly
weapon
of
witchcraft
;
the
new
candle
in
its
turn
burns
down
;
and
still
he
lies
insensible
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
what
remains
of
the
last
candle
is
blown
out
,
and
daylight
looks
into
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
It
has
not
looked
very
long
,
when
he
sits
up
,
chilled
and
shaking
,
slowly
recovers
consciousness
of
where
he
is
,
and
makes
himself
ready
to
depart
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
receives
what
he
pays
her
with
a
grateful
,
"
Bless
ye
,
bless
ye
,
deary
!
"
and
seems
,
tired
out
,
to
begin
making
herself
ready
for
sleep
as
he
leaves
the
room
.
   
<EOS>
But
seeming
may
be
false
or
true
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
false
in
this
case
;
for
,
the
moment
the
stairs
have
ceased
to
creak
under
his
tread
,
she
glides
after
him
,
muttering
emphatically
:
 
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
miss
ye
twice
!
"
   
<EOS>
There
is
no
egress
from
the
court
but
by
its
entrance
.
 
<EOS>
With
a
weird
peep
from
the
doorway
,
she
watches
for
his
looking
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
does
not
look
back
before
disappearing
,
with
a
wavering
step
.
 
<EOS>
She
follows
him
,
peeps
from
the
court
,
sees
him
still
faltering
on
without
looking
back
,
and
holds
him
in
view
.
   
<EOS>
He
repairs
to
the
back
of
Aldersgate
Street
,
where
a
door
immediately
opens
to
his
knocking
.
 
<EOS>
She
crouches
in
another
doorway
,
watching
that
one
,
and
easily
comprehending
that
he
puts
up
temporarily
at
that
house
.
 
<EOS>
Her
patience
is
unexhausted
by
hours
.
 
<EOS>
For
sustenance
she
can
,
and
does
,
buy
bread
within
a
hundred
yards
,
and
milk
as
it
is
carried
past
her
.
   
<EOS>
He
comes
forth
again
at
noon
,
having
changed
his
dress
,
but
carrying
nothing
in
his
hand
,
and
having
nothing
carried
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
not
going
back
into
the
country
,
therefore
,
just
yet
.
 
<EOS>
She
follows
him
a
little
way
,
hesitates
,
instantaneously
turns
confidently
,
and
goes
straight
into
the
house
he
has
quitted
.
   
<EOS>
"
Is
the
gentleman
from
Cloisterham
indoors
?
   
<EOS>
"
Just
gone
out
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Unlucky
.
 
<EOS>
When
does
the
gentleman
return
to
Cloisterham
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
six
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
   
"
Bless
ye
and
thank
ye
.
 
<EOS>
May
the
Lord
prosper
a
business
where
a
civil
question
,
even
from
a
poor
soul
,
is
so
civilly
answered
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
miss
ye
twice
!
"
<EOS>
repeats
the
poor
soul
in
the
street
,
and
not
so
civilly
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
lost
ye
last
,
where
that
omnibus
you
got
into
nigh
your
journey
's
end
plied
betwixt
the
station
and
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
I
was
n't
so
much
as
certain
that
you
even
went
right
on
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Now
I
know
ye
did
.
 
<EOS>
My
gentleman
from
Cloisterham
<EOS>
,
I
'll
be
there
before
ye
,
and
bide
your
coming
.
 
<EOS>
I
've
swore
my
oath
that
I
'll
not
miss
ye
twice
!
"
   
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
that
same
evening
the
poor
soul
stands
in
Cloisterham
High
Street
,
looking
at
the
many
quaint
gables
of
the
Nuns
'
House
,
and
getting
through
the
time
as
she
best
can
until
nine
o'clock
;
at
which
hour
she
has
reason
to
suppose
that
the
arriving
omnibus
passengers
may
have
some
interest
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
friendly
darkness
,
at
that
hour
,
renders
it
easy
for
her
to
ascertain
whether
this
be
so
or
not
;
and
it
is
so
,
for
the
passenger
not
to
be
missed
twice
arrives
among
the
rest
.
   
<EOS>
"
Now
let
me
see
what
becomes
of
you
.
 
<EOS>
Go
on
!
"
   
<EOS>
An
observation
addressed
to
the
air
,
and
yet
it
might
be
addressed
to
the
passenger
,
so
compliantly
does
he
go
on
along
the
High
Street
until
he
comes
to
an
arched
gateway
,
at
which
he
unexpectedly
vanishes
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
soul
quickens
her
pace
;
is
swift
,
and
close
upon
him
entering
under
the
gateway
;
but
only
sees
a
postern
staircase
on
one
side
of
it
,
and
on
the
other
side
an
ancient
vaulted
room
,
in
which
a
large
-
headed
,
gray
-
haired
gentleman
is
writing
,
under
the
odd
circumstances
of
sitting
open
to
the
thoroughfare
and
eyeing
all
who
pass
,
as
if
he
were
toll
-
taker
of
the
gateway
:
 
though
the
way
is
free
.
   
<EOS>
"
Halloa
!
"
<EOS>
he
cries
in
a
low
voice
,
seeing
her
brought
to
a
stand
-
still
:
 
"
who
are
you
looking
for
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
gentleman
passed
in
here
this
minute
,
sir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Of
course
there
was
.
 
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
with
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Where
do
he
live
,
deary
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Live
?
 
<EOS>
Up
that
staircase
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Bless
ye
!
 
<EOS>
Whisper
.
 
<EOS>
What
's
his
name
,
deary
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Surname
Jasper
,
Christian
name
John
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
John
Jasper
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Has
he
a
calling
,
good
gentleman
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Calling
?
 
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Sings
in
the
choir
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
the
spire
?
"
   
"
Choir
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
rises
from
his
papers
,
and
comes
to
his
doorstep
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
what
a
cathedral
is
?
"
he
asks
,
jocosely
.
   
<EOS>
The
woman
nods
.
   
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
looks
puzzled
,
casting
about
in
her
mind
to
find
a
definition
,
when
it
occurs
to
her
that
it
is
easier
to
point
out
the
substantial
object
itself
,
massive
against
the
dark
-
blue
sky
and
the
early
stars
.
   
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Go
in
there
at
seven
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
you
may
see
Mr
John
Jasper
,
and
hear
him
too
.
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
Thank
ye
!
 
<EOS>
Thank
ye
!
"
   
<EOS>
The
burst
of
triumph
in
which
she
thanks
him
does
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
single
buffer
of
an
easy
temper
living
idly
on
his
means
.
 
<EOS>
He
glances
at
her
;
clasps
his
hands
behind
him
,
as
the
wo
nt
of
such
buffers
is
;
and
lounges
along
the
echoing
Precincts
at
her
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
Or
,
"
he
suggests
,
with
a
backward
hitch
of
his
head
,
"
you
can
go
up
at
once
to
Mr
Jasper
's
rooms
there
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
eyes
him
with
a
cunning
smile
,
and
shakes
her
head
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
want
to
speak
to
him
?
"
   
<EOS>
She
repeats
her
dumb
reply
,
and
forms
with
her
lips
a
soundless
"
<EOS>
No
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
can
admire
him
at
a
distance
three
times
a
day
,
whenever
you
like
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
a
long
way
to
come
for
that
,
though
.
"
   
<EOS>
The
woman
looks
up
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
If
Mr
Datchery
thinks
she
is
to
be
so
induced
to
declare
where
she
comes
from
,
he
is
of
a
much
easier
temper
than
she
is
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
acquits
him
of
such
an
artful
thought
,
as
he
lounges
along
,
like
the
chartered
bore
of
the
city
,
with
his
uncovered
gray
hair
blowing
about
,
and
his
purposeless
hands
rattling
the
loose
money
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
.
   
<EOS>
The
chink
of
the
money
has
an
attraction
for
her
greedy
ears
.
<EOS>
"
Would
n't
you
help
me
to
pay
for
my
traveller
's
lodging
,
dear
gentleman
,
and
to
pay
my
way
along
?
 
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
soul
<EOS>
,
I
am
indeed
,
and
troubled
with
a
grievous
cough
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
You
know
the
travellers
'
lodging
,
I
perceive
,
and
are
making
directly
for
it
,
"
is
Mr
Datchery
's
bland
comment
,
still
rattling
his
loose
money
.
 
<EOS>
"
Been
here
often
,
my
good
woman
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Once
in
all
my
life
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Ay
,
ay
?
"
   
<EOS>
They
have
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
the
Monks
'
Vineyard
.
 
<EOS>
An
appropriate
remembrance
,
presenting
an
exemplary
model
for
imitation
,
is
revived
in
the
woman
's
mind
by
the
sight
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
She
stops
at
the
gate
,
and
says
energetically
:
   
<EOS>
"
By
this
token
,
though
you
may
n't
believe
it
,
That
a
young
gentleman
gave
me
three
-
and
-
sixpence
as
I
was
coughing
my
breath
away
on
this
very
grass
.
 
<EOS>
I
asked
him
for
three
-
and
-
sixpence
,
and
he
gave
it
me
.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Was
n't
it
a
little
cool
to
name
your
sum
?
"
<EOS>
hints
Mr
Datchery
,
still
rattling
.
 
<EOS>
"
Is
n't
it
customary
to
leave
the
amount
open
?
<EOS>
Might
n't
it
have
had
the
appearance
,
to
the
young
gentleman
---
only
the
appearance
---
that
he
was
rather
dictated
to
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
Look'ee
here
,
deary
<EOS>
,
"
she
replies
,
in
a
confidential
and
persuasive
tone
,
"
I
wanted
the
money
to
lay
it
out
on
a
medicine
as
does
me
good
,
and
as
I
deal
in
.
 
<EOS>
I
told
the
young
gentleman
so
,
and
he
gave
it
me
,
and
I
laid
it
out
honest
to
the
last
brass
farden
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
lay
out
the
same
sum
in
the
same
way
now
;
and
if
you
'll
give
it
me
,
I
'll
lay
it
out
honest
to
the
last
brass
farden
again
,
upon
my
soul
!
"
   
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
medicine
?
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
honest
with
you
beforehand
,
as
well
as
after
.
 
<EOS>
It
's
opium
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
,
with
a
sudden
change
of
countenance
,
gives
her
a
sudden
look
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
's
opium
,
deary
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
more
nor
less
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
's
like
a
human
creetur
so
far
,
that
you
always
hear
what
can
be
said
against
it
,
but
seldom
what
can
be
said
in
its
praise
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
begins
very
slowly
to
count
out
the
sum
demanded
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
Greedily
watching
his
hands
,
she
continues
to
hold
forth
on
the
great
example
set
him
.
   
<EOS>
"
It
was
last
Christmas
Eve
,
just
arter
dark
,
the
once
that
I
was
here
afore
,
when
the
young
gentleman
gave
me
the
three
-
and
-
six
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
stops
in
his
counting
,
finds
he
has
counted
wrong
,
shakes
his
money
together
,
and
begins
again
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
the
young
gentleman
's
name
,
"
she
adds
,
"
was
Edwin
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
drops
some
money
,
stoops
to
pick
it
up
,
and
reddens
with
the
exertion
as
he
asks
:
   
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
the
young
gentleman
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
   
<EOS>
"
I
asked
him
for
it
,
and
he
told
it
me
.
 
<EOS>
I
only
asked
him
the
two
questions
,
what
was
his
Chris'en
name
,
and
whether
he
'd
a
sweetheart
?
 
<EOS>
And
he
answered
,
Edwin
,
and
he
had
n't
.
"
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
pauses
with
the
selected
coins
in
his
hand
,
rather
as
if
he
were
falling
into
a
brown
study
of
their
value
,
and
could
n't
bear
to
part
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
woman
looks
at
him
distrustfully
,
and
with
her
anger
brewing
for
the
event
of
his
thinking
better
of
the
gift
;
but
he
bestows
it
on
her
as
if
he
were
abstracting
his
mind
from
the
sacrifice
,
and
with
many
servile
thanks
she
goes
her
way
.
   
<EOS>
John
Jasper
's
lamp
is
kindled
,
and
his
lighthouse
is
shining
when
Mr
Datchery
returns
alone
towards
it
.
 
<EOS>
As
mariners
on
a
dangerous
voyage
,
approaching
an
iron
-
bound
coast
,
may
look
along
the
beams
of
the
warning
light
to
the
haven
lying
beyond
it
that
may
never
be
reached
,
so
Mr
Datchery
's
wistful
gaze
is
directed
to
this
beacon
,
and
beyond
.
   
<EOS>
His
object
in
now
revisiting
his
lodging
is
merely
to
put
on
the
hat
which
seems
so
superfluous
an
article
in
his
wardrobe
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
half
-
past
ten
by
the
Cathedral
clock
when
he
walks
out
into
the
Precincts
again
;
he
lingers
and
looks
about
him
,
as
though
,
the
enchanted
hour
when
Mr
Durdles
may
be
stoned
home
having
struck
,
he
had
some
expectation
of
seeing
the
Imp
who
is
appointed
to
the
mission
of
stoning
him
.
   
<EOS>
In
effect
,
that
Power
of
Evil
is
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
Having
nothing
living
to
stone
at
the
moment
,
he
is
discovered
by
Mr
Datchery
in
the
unholy
office
of
stoning
the
dead
,
through
the
railings
of
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
The
Imp
finds
this
a
relishing
and
piquing
pursuit
;
firstly
,
because
their
resting
-
place
is
announced
to
be
sacred
;
and
secondly
,
because
the
tall
headstones
are
sufficiently
like
themselves
,
on
their
beat
in
the
dark
,
to
justify
the
delicious
fancy
that
they
are
hurt
when
hit
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
hails
with
him
:
 
"
Halloa
,
Winks
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
acknowledges
the
hail
with
:
 
"
Halloa
,
Dick
!
"
 
<EOS>
Their
acquaintance
seemingly
having
been
established
on
a
familiar
footing
.
   
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
I
say
,
"
he
remonstrates
,
"
do
n't
yer

<EOS>
I

The

the

up
all

Puffer

assents
Deputy

with
a
shrewd

of

and
smoking
an
imaginary

with
his

very

on

He
greatly
prolongs
the

in
his
ecstasy

and
smites
his
leg
,
and
doubles
himself
up
in
a
fit
of
shrill
laughter

<EOS>
"
How

He
separates
the
syllables
with
his
former
zest
,
and
,
not
finding
his
sense
of
the
ludicrous
sufficiently
relieved
by
stamping
about
on
the
pavement
,
breaks
into
a
slow
and
stately
dance
,
perhaps
supposed
to
be
performed
by
the
Dean
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
receives
the
communication
with
a
well
-
satisfied
though
pondering
face
,
and
breaks
up
the
conference
.
 
<EOS>
Returning
to
his
quaint
lodging
,
and
sitting
long
over
the
supper
of
bread
-
and
-
cheese
and
salad
and
ale
which
Mrs
Tope
has
left
prepared
for
him
,
he
still
sits
when
his
supper
is
finished
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
rises
,
throws
open
the
door
of
a
corner
cupboard
,
and
refers
to
a
few
uncouth
chalked
strokes
on
its
inner
side
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
like
,
"
says
Mr
Datchery
,
"
the
old
tavern
way
of
keeping
scores
.
<EOS>
Illegible
except
to
the
scorer
.
 
<EOS>
The
scorer
not
committed

the
scored
debited
with
what

against

<EOS>
Hum

<EOS>
A
very
small
score
this
;
a
very
poor
score
!
"
   
<EOS>
He
sighs
over
the
contemplation
of
its
poverty
,
takes
a
bit
of
chalk
from
one
of
the
cupboard
shelves
,
and
pauses
with
it
in
his
hand
,
uncertain
what
addition
to
make
to
the
account
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
think
a
moderate
stroke
,
"
he
concludes
,
"
is
all
I
am
justified
in
scoring
up
;
"
so
,
suits
the
action
to
the
word
,
closes
the
cupboard
,
and
goes
to
bed
.
   
<EOS>
A
brilliant
morning
shines
on
the
old
city
.
 
<EOS>
Its
antiquities
and
ruins
are
surpassingly
beautiful
,
with
a
lusty
ivy
gleaming
in
the
sun
,
and
the
rich
trees
waving
in
the
balmy
air
.
 
<EOS>
Changes
of
glorious
light
from
moving
boughs
,
songs
of
birds
,
scents
from
gardens
,
woods
,
and
fields
---
or
,
rather
,
from
the
one
great
garden
of
the
whole
cultivated
island
in
its
yielding
time
---
penetrate
into
the
Cathedral
,
subdue
its
earthy
odour
,
and
preach
the
Resurrection
and
the
Life
.
 
<EOS>
The
cold
stone
tombs
of
centuries
ago
grow
warm
;
and
flecks
of
brightness
dart
into
the
sternest
marble
corners
of
the
building
,
fluttering
there
like
wings
.
   
<EOS>
Comes
Mr
Tope
with
his
large
keys
,
and
yawningly
unlocks
and
sets
open
.
 
<EOS>
Come
Mrs
Tope
and
attendant
sweeping
sprites
.
 
<EOS>
Come
,
in
due
time
,
organist
and
bellows
-
boy
,
peeping
down
from
the
red
curtains
in
the
loft
,
fearlessly
flapping
dust
from
books
up
at
that
remote
elevation
,
and
whisking
it
from
stops
and
pedals
.
 
<EOS>
Come
sundry
rooks
,
from
various
quarters
of
the
sky
,
back
to
the
great
tower
;
who
may
be
presumed
to
enjoy
vibration
,
and
to
know
that
bell
and
organ
are
going
to
give
it
them
.
 
<EOS>
Come
a
very
small
and
straggling
congregation
indeed
:
 
chiefly
from
Minor
Canon
Corner
and
the
Precincts
.
 
<EOS>
Come
Mr
Crisparkle
,
fresh
and
bright
;
and
his
ministering
brethren
,
not
quite
so
fresh
and
bright
.
 
<EOS>
Come
the
Choir
in
a
hurry
(
always
in
a
hurry
,
and
struggling
into
their
nightgowns
at
the
last
moment
,
like
children
shirking
bed
)
,
and
comes
John
Jasper
leading
their
line
.
 
<EOS>
Last
of
all
comes
Mr
Datchery
into
a
stall
,
one
of
a
choice
empty
collection
very
much
at
his
service
,
and
glancing
about
him
for
Her
Royal
Highness
the
Princess
Puffer
.
   
<EOS>
The
service
is
pretty
well
advanced
before
Mr
Datchery
can
discern
Her
Royal
Highness
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
that
time
he
has
made
her
out
,
in
the
shade
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
behind
a
pillar
,
carefully
withdrawn
from
the
Choir
-
master
's
view
,
but
regards
him
with
the
closest
attention
.
 
<EOS>
All
unconscious
of
her
presence
,
he
chants
and
sings
.
 
<EOS>
She
grins
when
he
is
most
musically
fervid
,
and
<EOS>
---
yes
,
Mr
Datchery
sees
her
do
it
!
---
shakes
her
fist
at
him
behind
the
pillar
's
friendly
shelter
.
   
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
looks
again
,
to
convince
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
again
!
 
<EOS>
As
ugly
and
withered
as
one
of
the
fantastic
carvings
on
the
under
brackets
of
the
stall
seats
,
as
malignant
as
the
Evil
One
,
as
hard
as
the
big
brass
eagle
holding
the
sacred
books
upon
his
wings
(
and
,
according
to
the
sculptor
's
representation
of
his
ferocious
attributes
,
not
at
all
converted
by
them
)
,
she
hugs
herself
in
her
lean
arms
,
and
then
shakes
both
fists
at
the
leader
of
the
Choir
.
   
<EOS>
And
at
that
moment
,
outside
the
grated
door
of
the
Choir
,
having
eluded
the
vigilance
of
Mr
Tope
by
shifty
resources
in
which
he
is
an
adept
,
Deputy
peeps
,
sharp
-
eyed
,
through
the
bars
,
and
stares
astounded
from
the
threatener
to
the
threatened
.
   
<EOS>
The
service
comes
to
an
end
,
and
the
servitors
disperse
to
breakfast
.
 
<EOS>
Mr
Datchery
accosts
his
last
new
acquaintance
outside
,
when
the
Choir
(
as
much
in
a
hurry
to
get
their
bedgowns
off
,
as
they
were
but
now
to
get
them
on
)
have
