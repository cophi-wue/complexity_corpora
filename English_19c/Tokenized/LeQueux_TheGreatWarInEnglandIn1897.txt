Growled
by
thoughtful
,
stern
-
visaged
men
,
gasped
with
bated
breath
by
pale
-
faced
,
terrified
women
,
the
startling
news
passed
quickly
round
the
Avenue
Theatre
from
gallery
to
boxes
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
was
swift
,
complete
,
crushing
.
<EOS>
Actors
and
audience
were
appalled
.
 
<EOS>
Though
it
was
a
gay
comic
opera
that
was
being
performed
for
the
first
time
,
entertainers
and
entertained
lost
all
interest
in
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
were
amazed
,
dismayed
,
awestricken
.
<EOS>
Amusement
was
nauseating
;
War
,
with
all
its
attendant
horrors
,
was
actually
upon
them
!
<EOS>
The
popular
tenor
,
one
of
the
idols
of
the
hour
,
blundered
over
his
lines
and
sang
terribly
out
of
tune
,
but
the
hypercritical
first
-
night
audience
passed
the
defect
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
They
only
thought
of
what
might
happen
;
of
the
dark
cavernous
future
that
lay
before
.
 
<EOS>
War
had
been
declared
against
Britain
--
Britain
,
the
Empire
that
had
so
long
rested
in
placid
sea
-
girt
security
,
confident
of
immunity
from
attack
,
was
to
be
invaded
!
<EOS>
The
assertion
seemed
preposterous
.
 
<EOS>
Some
,
after
reading
eagerly
the
newspapers
still
damp
from
the
press
,
smiled
incredulously
,
half
inclined
to
regard
the
startling
intelligence
as
a
mere
fabrication
by
alarmists
,
or
a
perfected
phase
of
the
periodical
war
-
scare
which
sensational
journalists
annually
launch
upon
the
world
during
what
is
technically
known
as
the
"
gooseberry
"
season
.
 
<EOS>
Other
readers
,
however
,
recollecting
the
grave
political
crises
on
the
Continent
,
set
their
teeth
firmly
,
silent
and
dumfounded
.
<EOS>
Upon
many
merchants
and
City
men
the
news
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
,
for
financial
ruin
stared
them
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
Evidently
a
desperate
attempt
would
be
made
by
the
enemy
to
land
on
English
soil
.
<EOS>
Already
the
startled
playgoers
could
hear
in
their
excited
imagination
the
clash
of
arms
mingling
with
the
triumphant
yell
of
the
victor
,
and
the
stifled
,
despairing
cry
of
the
hapless
victim
.
<EOS>
But
who
,
they
wondered
,
would
be
the
victim
?
<EOS>
Would
Britannia
ever
fall
to
the
dust
with
broken
trident
and
shattered
shield
?
<EOS>
Would
her
neck
ever
lie
under
the
heel
of
the
foreign
invader
?
<EOS>
No
,
never
--
while
Britons
could
fight
.
 
<EOS>
The
theatre
,
in
its
garish
blaze
of
electricity
,
and
crowded
with
well
-
dressed
men
and
women
,
presented
a
brilliant
appearance
,
which
had
suddenly
become
strangely
incongruous
with
the
feelings
of
the
audience
.
<EOS>
In
the
boxes
,
where
youth
and
beauty
smiled
,
the
bouquets
which
had
been
provided
by
the
management
gave
to
the
theatre
a
bright
,
artistic
touch
of
colour
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
pungent
odour
they
diffused
had
become
sickening
.
<EOS>
Intermingled
with
other
flowers
there
were
many
tuberoses
.
<EOS>
They
are
funereal
blossoms
,
ineffably
emblematic
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
There
is
death
in
their
breath
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
astounding
news
fell
upon
the
house
the
performance
was
drawing
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
A
moment
before
,
every
one
had
been
silent
and
motionless
,
listening
with
rapt
attention
to
the
tenor
's
plaintive
love
song
,
and
admiring
the
grace
of
the
fair
heroine
,
but
as
the
terrible
truth
dawned
upon
them
they
rose
,
amid
a
scene
of
the
wildest
excitement
.
<EOS>
The
few
papers
that
had
been
purchased
at
fabulous
prices
at
the
doors
were
eagerly
scanned
,
many
of
the
sheets
being
torn
into
shreds
in
the
mad
struggle
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
alarming
telegrams
they
contained
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
the
agitation
nearly
approached
a
panic
,
while
above
the
hum
and
din
the
hoarse
,
strident
voices
of
running
newsmen
could
be
heard
outside
,
yelling
,
"
War
declared
against
England
!
<EOS>
Expected
landing
of
the
enemy
!
<EOS>
Extrur
-
speshal
!
"
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
hidden
terror
in
the
word
"
War
"
that
at
first
held
the
amazed
playgoers
breathless
and
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
its
significance
appeared
so
grim
,
so
fatal
,
so
fraught
with
appalling
consequences
.
 
<EOS>
War
had
been
actually
declared
!
<EOS>
There
was
no
averting
it
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
stern
reality
.
 
<EOS>
No
adroit
diplomatic
negotiations
could
stem
the
advancing
hordes
of
foreign
invaders
;
Ministers
and
ambassadors
were
as
useless
pawns
,
for
two
great
nations
had
had
the
audacity
to
combine
in
the
projected
attack
upon
Great
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
incredible
,
impossible
.
<EOS>
True
,
a
Great
War
had
long
been
predicted
,
forecasts
had
been
given
of
coming
conflicts
,
and
European
nations
had
for
years
been
gradually
strengthening
their
armies
and
perfecting
their
engines
of
war
,
in
the
expectation
of
being
plunged
into
hostilities
.
<EOS>
Modern
improvements
in
arms
and
ammunition
had
so
altered
the
conditions
of
war
,
that
there
had
long
been
a
feeling
of
insecurity
even
among
those
Powers
who
,
a
few
years
before
,
had
felt
themselves
strong
enough
to
resist
any
attack
,
however
violent
.
<EOS>
War
-
scares
had
been
plentiful
,
crises
in
France
,
Germany
,
and
Russia
of
frequent
occurrence
;
still
,
no
one
dreamed
that
Moloch
was
in
their
midst
--
that
the
Great
War
,
so
long
foreshadowed
,
had
in
reality
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
on
this
hot
,
oppressive
Saturday
night
in
August
the
extra
-
special
editions
of
the
papers
contained
news
that
startled
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
ran
as
follows:--

The
most
intense
excitement
has
been
caused
here
by
a
totally
    
unexpected
and
amazing
announcement
made
this
afternoon
by
the
    
Minister
of
Foreign
Affairs
to
the
French
Ambassador
.
<EOS>
It
appears
    
that
the
Minister
has
addressed
to
the
French
representative
a
    
short
note
in
which
<EOS>
the
following
extraordinary
passage
    
occurs:--
     
"
The
earnest
negotiations
between
the
Imperial
Government
and
    
Great
Britain
for
a
durable
pacification
of
Bosnia
not
having
    
led
to
the
desired
accord
,
His
Majesty
the
Tsar
,
my
august
    
master
,
sees
himself
compelled
,
to
his
regret
,
to
have
recourse
    
to
force
of
arms
.
<EOS>
Be
therefore
so
kind
as
to
inform
your
    
Government
that
from
to
-
day
Russia
considers
herself
in
a
state
    
of
war
with
Great
Britain
,
and
requests
that
France
will
    
immediately
comply
with
the
obligations
of
the
alliance
signed
    
by
President
Carnot
on
February
23rd
,
1892

<EOS>
A
circular
note
has
also
been
addressed
by
the
Russian
Foreign
    
Office
to
its
ambassadors
at
the
principal
Courts
of
Europe
,
    
stating
that
,
for
reasons
assigned
,
the
Tsar
has
resolved
to
    
commence
hostilities
against
Great
Britain
,
and
has
given
his
    
Armies
and
Navy
orders
to
commence
the
invasion
.
     
<EOS>
This
declaration
has
,
no
doubt
,
been
contemplated
by
the
Russian
    
Government
for
several
days
.
<EOS>
During
the
past
week
the
French
    
Ambassador
has
twice
had
private
audience
of
the
Tsar
,
and
soon
    
after
11
A.M.
to
-
day
he
had
a
long
interview
at
the
Ministry
of
    
Foreign
Affairs
.
<EOS>
It
is
understood
that
the
Minister
of
War
was
    
also
present
.
     
<EOS>
No
official
notification
of
the
Declaration
of
War
has
been
    
given
to
the
British
Ambassador
.
<EOS>
This
has
created
considerable
    
surprise
.

Large
posters
,
headed
"
A
Manifesto
of
His
Majesty
the
Emperor
of
    
Russia
,
"
and
addressed
to
his
subjects
,
are
being
posted
up
in
    
the
Nevski
Prospekt
.
<EOS>
In
this
document
the
Tsar
says--
     
<EOS>
"
Our
faithful
and
beloved
subjects
know
the
strong
interest
    
which
we
have
constantly
felt
in
the
destinies
of
our
Empire
.
    
<EOS>
Our
desire
for
the
pacification
of
our
western
frontier
has
been
    
shared
by
the
whole
Russian
nation
,
which
now
shows
itself
ready
    
to
bear
fresh
sacrifices
to
alleviate
the
position
of
those
    
oppressed
by
British
rule
.
<EOS>
The
blood
and
property
of
our
    
faithful
subjects
have
always
been
dear
to
us
,
and
our
whole
    
reign
attests
our
constant
solicitude
to
preserve
to
Russia
the
    
benefits
of
peace
.
<EOS>
This
solicitude
never
failed
to
actuate
my
    
father
during
events
which
occurred
recently
in
Bulgaria
,
    
Austro
-
Hungary
,
and
Bosnia
.
<EOS>
Our
object
,
before
all
,
was
to
    
effect
an
amelioration
in
the
position
of
our
people
on
the
    
frontier
by
means
of
pacific
negotiations
,
and
in
concert
with
    
the
great
European
Powers
,
our
allies
and
friends
.
<EOS>
Having
,
    
however
,
exhausted
our
pacific
efforts
,
we
are
compelled
by
the
    
haughty
obstinacy
of
Great
Britain
to
proceed
to
more
decisive
    
acts
.
<EOS>
A
feeling
of
equity
and
of
our
own
dignity
enjoins
it
.
<EOS>
By
    
her
recent
acts
Great
Britain
places
us
under
the
necessity
of
    
having
recourse
to
arms
.
<EOS>
Profoundly
convinced
of
the
justice
of
    
our
cause
,
we
make
known
to
our
faithful
subjects
that
we
    
declare
war
against
Great
Britain
.
<EOS>
In
now
invoking
a
blessing
    
upon
our
valiant
armies
,
we
give
the
order
for
an
invasion
of
    
England

This
manifesto

and
impetuous
agitation
had
ever
before
been
witnessed
within
those
walls
.
<EOS>
Some
enthusiast
of
the
pit
,
springing
to
his
feet
,
and
drawing
a
large
red
handkerchief
from
his
pocket
,
waved
it
,
shouting--
 
<EOS>
"
Three
cheers
for
good
Old
England
!
"
<EOS>
to
which
,
after
a
moment
's
silence
,
the
audience
responded
lustily
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
almost
before
the
last
sound
had
died
away
,
another
patriot
of
the
people
mounted
upon
his
seat
,
crying--
 
<EOS>
"
No
one
need
fear
.
<EOS>
The
British
Lion
will
quickly
hold
the
French
Eagle
and
the
Russian
Bear
within
his
jaws
.
<EOS>
Let
the
enemy
come
;
we
will
mow
them
down
like
hay
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
raised
a
combined
laugh
and
cheer
,
though
it
sounded
forced
and
hollow
.
<EOS>
Immediately
,
however
,
some
buoyant
spirits
in
the
gallery
commenced
singing
"
Rule
,
Britannia
,
"
the
chorus
of
which
was
taken
up
vigorously
,
the
orchestra
assisting
by
playing
the
last
verse
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
,
the
scene
in
the
streets
was
one
of
momentarily
increasing
excitement
.
<EOS>
The
news
had
spread
with
marvellous
rapidity
,
and
the
whole
city
was
agog
.
<EOS>
An
elbowing
,
waving
,
stormy
crowd
surged
down
the
Strand
to
Trafalgar
Square
,
where
an
impromptu
demonstration
was
being
held
,
the
Government
being
denounced
by
its
opponents
,
and
spoken
of
with
confidence
by
its
supporters
.
<EOS>
The
Radical
,
the
Socialist
,
the
Anarchist
,
each
aired
his
views
,
and
through
the
throng
a
hoarse
threatening
murmur
condensed
into
three
words
,
"
Down
with
Russia
!
<EOS>
Down
with
France
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
cry
,
echoed
by
a
thousand
throats
,
mingled
weirdly
with
the
shouts
of
the
newsmen
and
the
snatches
of
patriotic
songs
.
 
<EOS>
London
was
anxious
,
fevered
,
and
turbulent
,
that
hot
,
moonless
August
night
.
<EOS>
At
that
hour
all
the
shops
were
closed
,
and
the
streets
only
lighted
by
the
lamps
.
<EOS>
From
the
unlighted
windows
the
indistinct
shapes
of
heads
looking
out
on
the
scene
could
be
distinguished
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
pavements
of
Piccadilly
and
Knightsbridge
knots
of
people
stood
arguing
and
wrangling
over
the
probable
turn
of
events
.
<EOS>
From
uncouth
Whitechapel
to
artistic
Kensington
,
from
sylvan
Highgate
to
the
villadom
of
Dulwich
,
the
amazing
intelligence
had
been
conveyed
by
the
presses
of
Fleet
Street
,
which
were
still
belching
forth
tons
of
damp
news
-
sheets
.
<EOS>
At
first
there
was
confidence
among
the
people
;
nevertheless
little
by
little
this
confidence
diminished
,
and
curiosity
gave
place
to
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
All
was
shrouded
in
the
darkest
gloom
.
<EOS>
In
the
atmosphere
was
a
strange
and
terrible
oppression
that
seemed
to
weigh
down
men
and
crush
them
.
<EOS>
London
was
,
it
appeared
,
walled
in
by
the
unknown
and
the
unexpected
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
all
,
England
was
strong
;
it
was
the
mighty
British
Empire
;
it
was
the
world
.
<EOS>
What
was
there
to
fear
?
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
So
the
people
continued
to
shout
,
"
Down
with
France
!
<EOS>
Down
with
the
Autocrat
!
<EOS>
Down
with
the
Tsar
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
young
man
,
who
had
been
sitting
alone
in
the
stalls
,
had
risen
,
electrified
at
the
alarming
news
,
and
rushing
out
,
hailed
a
passing
cab
,
and
drove
rapidly
away
up
Northumberland
Avenue
.
<EOS>
This
conduct
was
remarkable
,
for
Geoffrey
Engleheart
was
scarcely
the
man
to
flinch
when
danger
threatened
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
,
athletic
young
fellow
of
twenty
-
six
,
with
wavy
brown
hair
,
a
dark
,
smartly
-
trimmed
moustache
,
and
handsome
,
well
-
cut
features
.
<EOS>
He
was
happy
and
easy
-
going
,
always
overflowing
with
genuine
_
bonhomie
_
.
<EOS>
As
the
younger
son
of
a
very
distinguished
officer
,
he
contrived
to
employ
himself
for
a
couple
of
hours
a
day
at
the
Foreign
Office
,
where
,
although
a
clerk
,
he
held
a
very
responsible
position
.
<EOS>
Belonging
to
a
rather
good
set
,
he
was
a
member
of
several
fashionable
clubs
,
and
lived
in
cosy
,
well
-
furnished
chambers
in
St.
James
's
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Driving
first
to
the
house
of
his
_
fiancee
_
,
Violet
Vayne
,
at
Rutland
Gate
,
he
informed
her
family
of
the
startling
intelligence
;
then
,
re
-
entering
the
conveyance
,
he
subsequently
alighted
before
the
door
of
his
chambers
.
<EOS>
As
he
paid
the
cabman
,
an
ill
-
clad
man
pushed
a
newspaper
into
his
face
,
crying
,
"
'
Ere

<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Geoffrey
started
.
<EOS>
He
staggered
,
his
heart
gave
a
bound
,
and
his
face
blanched
.
<EOS>
Thrusting
half
a
crown
into
the
man
's
dirty
palm
,
he
grasped
the
paper
,
and
rushing
upstairs
to
his
sitting
-
room
,
cast
himself
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
In
breathless
eagerness
he
glanced
at
the
front
page
of
the
journal
,
and
read
the
following:--
     
SCANDAL
<EOS>
AT
<EOS>
THE
FOREIGN
OFFICE
.
    
<EOS>
A
STATE
SECRET
DIVULGED
.
     
<EOS>
An
extraordinary
rumour
is
going
the
round
of
the
Service
clubs
    
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
is
alleged
that
the
present
Declaration
of
War
    
would
have
been
impossible
but
for
the
treachery
of
some
person
    
through
whose
hands
the
transcript
of
a
secret
treaty
between
    
England
and
Germany
passed
to
-
day
.
     
<EOS>
A
prominent
Cabinet
Minister
,
on
being
questioned
by
our
    
reporter
on
the
subject
,
admitted
that
he
had
heard
the
rumour
,
    
but
declined
to
make
any
definite
statement
whether
or
not
it
    
was
true
.
     
<EOS>
There
must
be
a
good
deal
behind
the
rumour
of
treachery
,
    
inasmuch
as
none
of
the
prominent
men
who
have
already
been
    
interviewed
gave
a
denial
to
the
statement
.
 
<EOS>
Geoffrey
sat
pale
and
motionless
,
with
eyes
fixed
upon
the
printed
words
.
<EOS>
He
read
and
re
-
read
them
until
the
lines
danced
before
his
gaze
,
and
he
crushed
the
paper
in
his
hands
,
and
cast
it
from
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
French
clock
on
the
mantelshelf
chimed
the
hour
of
one
upon
its
silvery
bell
;
the
lamp
spluttered
and
burned
dim
.
<EOS>
Still
he
did
not
move
;
he
was
dumfounded
,
rooted
to
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Blacker
and
blacker
grew
the
crowd
outside
.
<EOS>
The
density
of
the
cloud
that
hung
over
all
portended
some
direful
tragedy
.
<EOS>
The
impending
disaster
made
itself
felt
.
<EOS>
An
alarming
sense
of
calmness
filled
the
streets
.
<EOS>
A
silence
had
suddenly
fallen
,
and
was
becoming
complete
and
threatening
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
that
was
about
to
issue
from
these
black
storm
-
clouds
?
<EOS>
Who
could
tell
?
    
CHAPTER
III
.
 
<EOS>
ARMING
FOR
THE
STRUGGLE
.
  
<EOS>
London
was
amazed
.
 
<EOS>
The
provinces
were
awestricken
,
paralysed
by
the
startling
suddenness
with
which
the
appalling
news
of
the
invasion
had
been
flashed
to
them
.
<EOS>
Bewildered
,
the
people
could
not
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
Only
slowly
did
the
vivid
and
terrible
truth
dawn
individually
upon
the
millions
north
and
south
,
and
then
,
during
the
Day
of
Rest
,
they
crowded
to
the
newspaper
and
telegraph
offices
,
loudly
clamouring
for
further
details
of
the
overwhelming
catastrophe
that
threatened
.
<EOS>
They
sought
for
information
from
London
;
they
expected
London
,
the
mighty
,
all
-
powerful
capital
,
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
blazing
Sunday
the
dust
rose
from
the
impatient
,
perspiring
crowds
in
towns
and
cities
,
and
the
cool
night
brought
no
rest
from
a
turmoil
now
incessant
.
<EOS>
Never
before
were
such
scenes
of
intense
enthusiasm
witnessed
in
England
,
Wales
,
and
Scotland
,
for
this
was
the
first
occasion
on
which
the
public
felt
the
presence
of
invaders
at
their
very
doors
.
 
<EOS>
A
mighty
force
was
on
its
way
to
ruin
their
homes
,
to
sweep
from
them
their
hard
-
earned
savings
,
to
crush
,
to
conquer
--
to
kill
them
!
 
<EOS>
Fierce
antagonism
rose
spontaneously
in
every
Briton
's
heart
,
and
during
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
day
,
at
every
barracks
throughout
the
country
,
recruiting
-
sergeants
were
besieged
by
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
men
eager
to
accept
the
Queen
's
shilling
,
and
strike
for
their
country
's
honour
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
danger
,
of
hardship
,
of
the
fickle
fortune
of
the
fight
,
the
determination
to
assist
in
the
struggle
rose
instantly
within
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
York
,
Chester
,
Edinburgh
,
and
Portsmouth
,
volunteers
came
forward
by
hundreds
.
<EOS>
All
were
enthusiastic
,
undrilled
,
but
ready
to
use
their
guns
--
genuinely
heroic
patriots
of
our
land
,
such
as
are
included
in
no
other
nation
than
the
British
.
<EOS>
Pluck
,
zeal
for
the
public
safety
,
and
an
intense
partisanship
towards
their
fellows
induced
thousands
to
join
the
colours
--
many
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
sink
later
beneath
a
foeman
's
bullet
,
unknown
,
unhonoured
heroes
!
 
<EOS>
Already
the
Cabinet
had
held
a
hurried
meeting
,
at
which
it
had
been
decided
to
call
out
the
whole
of
the
Reserves
.
<EOS>
Of
this
the
War
Office
and
Admiralty
had
been
notified
,
and
the
Queen
had
given
her
sanction
to
the
necessary
proclamations
,
with
the
result
that
telegraphic
orders
had
been
issued
to
general
officers
commanding
and
to
officers
commanding
Reservists
to
mobilise
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
The
posters
containing
the
proclamation
,
which
are
always
kept
in
readiness
in
the
hands
of
officers
commanding
Regimental
Districts
,
were
issued
immediately
,
and
exhibited
on
all
public
places
throughout
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
On
the
doors
of
town
halls
,
churches
,
chapels
,
police
stations
,
military
barracks
,
and
in
the
windows
of
post
offices
,
these
notices
were
posted
within
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
Crowds
everywhere
collected
to
read
them
,
and
the
greatest
enthusiasm
was
displayed
.
<EOS>
Militia
,
Yeomanry
,
Volunteers
,
all
were
called
out
,
and
men
on
reading
the
Mobilisation
Order
lost
no
time
in
obtaining
their
accoutrements
and
joining
their
depots
.
<EOS>
The
national
danger
was
imminent
,
and
towards
their
"
places
of
concentration
"
all
categories
of
Her
Majesty
's
forces
were
already
moving
.
<EOS>
In
every
Regimental
District
the
greatest
activity
was
displayed
.
<EOS>
No
country
maintains
in
peace
the
full
complement
,
or
anything
approaching
the
full
complement
of
transport
which
its
Armies
require
;
<EOS>
hence
vehicles
and
horses
to
complete
the
Army
Service
Corps
companies
,
and
for
the
supplemental
service
,
were
being
immediately
requisitioned
from
far
and
near
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
many
anomalies
discovered
during
this
critical
period
was
,
that
while
transport
could
thus
be
rapidly
requisitioned
,
yet
the
impressment
of
civilians
as
drivers
and
caretakers
of
the
animals
was
not
permitted
by
the
law
;
therefore
on
all
hands
the
organisation
of
this
requisitioned
transport
was
fraught
with
the
utmost
difficulty
,
the
majority
of
owners
and
employees
refusing
to
come
forward
voluntarily
.
<EOS>
Registered
horses
were
quickly
collected
,
but
they
were
far
from
sufficient
for
the
requirements
,
and
the
want
of
animals
caused
loud
outcries
from
every
Regimental
District
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
scheme
was
the
constitution
of
a
Field
Army
of
four
cavalry
brigades
and
three
army
corps
,
with
behind
them
a
semi
-
mobile
force
made
up
of
thirty
-
three
Volunteer
infantry
brigades
and
eighty
-
four
Volunteer
batteries
of
position
.
<EOS>
The
garrisons
having
been
provided
for
<EOS>
,
the
four
cavalry
brigades
and
the
1st
and
2nd
Army
Corps
were
to
be
composed
entirely
of
Regulars
,
the
3rd
Army
Corps
being
made
up
of
Regulars
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
.
<EOS>
Organised
in
brigades
,
the
Yeomanry
were
attached
to
the
various
infantry
brigades
or
divisions
of
the
Field
Army
,
and
the
Regular
Medical
Staff
Corps
being
much
too
weak
,
was
strengthened
from
companies
of
the
Volunteer
Medical
Staff
Corps
.
<EOS>
In
brief
,
the
scheme
was
the
formation
of
a
composite
Field
Army
,
backed
by
a
second
line
of
partially
trained
Auxiliaries
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
general
scheme
to
set
in
battle
order
<EOS>
our
land
forces
for
home
defence
was
,
no
doubt
,
well
devised
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
from
the
first
moment
the
most
glaring
defects
in
the
working
out
of
details
were
everywhere
manifested
.
<EOS>
Stores
were
badly
disposed
,
there
was
a
sad
want
of
clothing
,
camp
equipment
,
and
arms
,
and
the
arrangements
for
the
joining
of
Reservists
were
throughout
defective
.
<EOS>
Again
,
the
whole
Reserve
had
been
left
totally
untrained
from
the
day
the
men
left
the
colours
;
and
having
in
view
the
fact
that
all
leading
authorities
in
Europe
had
,
times
without
number
,
told
us
that
the
efficiency
of
an
Army
depended
on
drill
,
discipline
,
and
shooting
,
what
could
be
expected
from
a
system
which
relied
in
great
part
for
the
safety
of
the
country
on
a
Reserve
,
the
members
of
which
were
undisciplined
,
undrilled
,
and
unpractised
in
shooting
for
periods
ranging
from
nine
years
in
the
Guards
to
five
years
in
the
case
of
the
Line
?
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
mobilisation
not
a
single
regiment
in
the
United
Kingdom
was
ready
to
move
forward
to
the
front
as
it
stood
on
parade
!
<EOS>
Not
an
officer
,
not
a
man
,
was
prepared
.
<EOS>
England
had
calmly
slept
for
years
,
while
military
reforms
had
been
effected
in
every
other
European
country
.
<EOS>
Now
she
had
been
suddenly
and
rudely
awakened
!
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
it
was
commented
upon
that
no
practical
peace
trial
of
the
mobilisation
scheme
had
ever
been
made
.
<EOS>
Little
wonder
was
there
,
then
,
that
incomplete
details
hampered
rapid
movements
,
or
that
the
carrying
out
of
the
definite
and
distinct
programme
was
prevented
by
gaps
occurring
which
could
not
be
discovered
until
the
working
of
the
system
had
been
tested
by
actual
experiment
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
this
past
apathy
of
the
authorities
,
amounting
to
little
less
than
criminal
negligence
,
<EOS>
that
formed
the
text
of
the
vehement
outpourings
of
Anarchists
,
Socialists
,
and
"
No
War
"
partisans
.
<EOS>
A
practical
test
of
the
efficiency
of
the
scheme
to
concentrate
our
forces
should
have
taken
place
even
at
the
risk
of
public
expenditure
,
instead
of
making
the
experiment
when
the
enemy
were
actually
at
our
doors
.
 
<EOS>
Another
anomaly
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
public
,
ought
long
ago
to
have
been
removed
,
was
the
fact
that
the
billeting
of
troops
on
the
march
on
the
inhabitants
of
the
United
Kingdom
,
other
than
owners
of
hotels
,
inns
,
livery
stables
,
and
public
-
houses
,
is
illegal
,
while
troops
when
not
on
the
march
can
not
be
billeted
at
all
!
<EOS>
At
many
points
of
concentration
this
absurd
and
antiquated
regulation
,
laid
down
by
the
Army
Act
in
1881
,
was
severely
felt
.
<EOS>
Public
buildings
,
churches
,
and
schools
had
to
be
hired
for
the
accommodation
of
the
troops
,
and
those
others
who
could
not
find
private
persons
hospitable
enough
to
take
them
in
were
compelled
to
bivouac
where
they
could
.
<EOS>
Of
tents
they
had
scarcely
any
,
and
many
regiments
were
thus
kept
homeless
and
badly
fed
several
days
before
moving
forward
!
 
<EOS>
Was
there
any
wonder
,
then
,
that
some
men
should
lose
heart
?
<EOS>
Did
not
such
defects
portend
--
nay
,
invite
disaster
?
 
<EOS>
Strange
though
it
may
seem
,
Geoffrey
Engleheart
was
one
of
but
two
persons
in
England
who
had
on
that
Saturday
anticipated
this
sudden
Declaration
of
War
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
hot
night
,
without
heed
of
the
wild
turbulence
outside
,
regardless
of
the
songs
of
patriots
,
of
gleeful
shouts
of
Anarchists
,
that
,
mingling
into
a
dull
roar
,
penetrated
the
heavy
curtains
before
the
window
of
his
room
,
he
sat
with
brows
knit
and
gaze
transfixed
.
 
<EOS>
Words
now
and
then
escaped
his
compressed
lips
.
<EOS>
They
were
low
and
ominous
;
utterances
of
blank
despair
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
 
<EOS>
THE
SPY
.
  
<EOS>
Count
von
Beilstein
was
a
polished
cosmopolitan
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
many
ways
a
very
remarkable
man
.
 
<EOS>
In
London
society
he
was
as
popular
as
he
had
previously
been
in
Paris
and
in
Berlin
.
<EOS>
Well
-
preserved
and
military
-
looking
,
he
retained
the
vigour
,
high
spirits
,
and
spruce
step
of
youth
,
spent
his
money
freely
,
and
led
the
almost
idyllic
life
of
a
careless
bachelor
in
the
Albany
.
 
<EOS>
Since
his
partnership
with
Sir
Joseph
Vayne
,
the
well
-
known
shipowner
,
father
of
Geoffrey
's
_
fiancee
_
,
he
had
taken
up
a
prominent
position
in
commercial
circles
,
was
a
member
of
the
London
Chamber
of
Commerce
,
took
an
active
part
in
the
various
deliberations
of
that
body
,
and
in
the
City
was
considered
a
man
of
considerable
importance
.
 
<EOS>
How
we
of
the
world
,
however
shrewd
,
are
deceived
by
outward
appearances
!
 
<EOS>
Of
the
millions
in
London
there
were
but
two
men
who
knew
the
truth
;
who
were
aware
of
the
actual
position
held
by
this
German
landed
proprietor
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
Count
's
friends
little
dreamed
that
under
the
outward
cloak
of
careless
ease
induced
by
wealth
there
was
a
mind
endowed
with
a
cunning
that
was
extraordinary
,
and
an
ingenuity
that
was
marvellous
.
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
,
Karl
von
Beilstein
,
who
posed
as
the
owner
of
the
great
Beilstein
estates
,
extending
along
the
beautiful
valley
of
the
Moselle
,
between
Alf
and
Cochem
,
was
not
an
aristocrat
at
all
,
and
possessed
no
estate
more
tangible
than
the
proverbial
chateau
in
Spain
.

COUNT
VON
BEILSTEIN
WAS
A
SPY
!
"
]
 
<EOS>
Count
von
Beilstein
was
a
_
spy
_
!
 
<EOS>
His
life
had
been
a
strangely
varied
one
;
few
men
perhaps
had
seen
more
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
His
biography
was
recorded
in
certain
police
registers
.
<EOS>
Born
in
the
Jews
'
quarter
at
Frankfort
,
he
had
,
at
an
early
age
,
turned
adventurer
,
and
for
some
years
was
well
known
at
Monte
Carlo
as
a
successful
gamester
.
<EOS>
But
the
Fickle
Goddess
at
last
forsook
him
,
and
under
another
name
he
started
a
bogus
loan
office
in
Brussels
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
did
not
last
long
,
for
the
police
one
night
made
a
raid
on
the
place
,
only
to
discover
that
Monsieur
had
flown
.
<EOS>
An
extensive
robbery
of
diamonds
in
Amsterdam
,
a
theft
of
bonds
while
in
transit
between
Hanover
and
Berlin
,
and
the
forgery
of
a
large
quantity
of
Russian
rouble
notes
,
were
events
which
followed
in
quick
succession
,
and
in
each
of
them
the
police
detected
the
adroit
hand
of
the
man
who
now
called
himself
the
Count
von
Beilstein
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
by
sheer
ill
-
luck
,
he
fell
into
the
grip
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
St.
Petersburg
,
where
he
had
opened
an
office
in
the
Bolshaia
,
and
started
as
a
diamond
dealer
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
genuine
transactions
he
obtained
possession
of
gems
worth
nearly
L20,000
,
and
decamped
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Russian
police
were
quickly
at
his
heels
,
and
he
was
arrested
in
Riga
,
being
subsequently
tried
and
condemned
by
the
Assize
Court
at
St.
Petersburg
to
twelve
years
'
exile
in
Siberia
.
<EOS>
In
chains
,
with
a
convoy
of
convicts
he
crossed
the
Urals
,
and
tramped
for
weeks
on
the
snow
-
covered
Siberian
Post
Road
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
still
appears
on
the
register
at
the
forwarding
prison
of
Tomsk
,
with
a
note
stating
that
he
was
sent
on
to
the
silver
mines
of
Nertchinsk
,
the
most
dreaded
in
Asiatic
Russia
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
,
strangely
enough
,
within
twelve
months
of
his
sentence
he
appeared
at
Royat
-
les
-
Bains
,
in
Auvergne
,
posing
as
a
Count
,
and
living
expensively
at
one
of
the
best
hotels
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
reason
for
all
this
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
Government
,
when
he
was
sentenced
,
were
well
aware
of
his
perfect
training
as
a
cosmopolitan
adventurer
,
of
his
acquaintance
with
persons
of
rank
,
and
of
his
cool
unscrupulousness
.
<EOS>
Hence
it
was
that
one
night
<EOS>
while
on
the
march
along
the
Great
Post
Road
to
that
bourne
whence
few
convicts
return
,
it
was
hinted
to
him
by
the
captain
of
Cossacks
,
that
he
might
obtain
his
liberty
,
and
a
good
income
in
addition
,
if
he
consented
to
become
a
secret
agent
of
the
Tsar
.
 
<EOS>
The
authorities
desired
him
to
perform
a
special
duty
;
would
he
consent
?
<EOS>
He
could
exchange
a
life
of
heavy
toil
in
the
Nertchinsk
mines
for
one
of
comparative
idleness
and
ease
.
<EOS>
The
offer
was
tempting
,
and
he
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
it
was
announced
to
his
fellow
-
convicts
that
the
Tsar
had
pardoned
him
;
his
leg
-
fetters
were
thereupon
struck
off
,
and
he
started
upon
his
return
to
St.
Petersburg
to
receive
instructions
as
to
the
delicate
mission
he
was
to
perform
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
became
the
Count
von
Beilstein
,
and
his
subsequent
actions
all
betrayed
the
most
remarkable
daring
,
forethought
,
and
tact
.
<EOS>
With
one
object
in
view
he
exercised
an
amount
of
patience
that
was
almost
incredible
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
minor
missions
were
entrusted
to
him
by
his
official
taskmasters
on
the
banks
of
the
Neva
,
and
in
each
he
acquitted
himself
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
was
a
thoroughly
patriotic
subject
of
the
Kaiser
,
with
tastes
strongly
anti
-
Muscovite
,
and
after
his
partnership
with
Sir
Joseph
Vayne
he
resided
in
London
,
and
mixed
a
good
deal
with
military
men
,
because
he
had
,
he
said
,
held
a
commission
in
a
Hussar
regiment
in
the
Fatherland
,
and
took
the
liveliest
interest
in
all
military
matters
.
 
<EOS>
Little
did
those
officers
dream
that
the
information
he
gained
about
improvements
in
England
's
defences
was
forwarded
in
regular
and
carefully
-
written
reports
to
the
Russian
War
Office
,
or
that
the
Tsar
's
messenger
who
carried
weekly
despatches
between
the
Russian
Ambassador
in
London
and
his
Government
frequently
took
with
him
a
packet
containing
plans
and
tracings
which
bore
marginal
notes
in
the
angular
handwriting
of
the
popular
Count
von
Beilstein
!
 
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
of
this
memorable
day
when
the
startling
news
of
the
Declaration
of
War
had
reached
England
,
a
telegram
had
been
handed
to
the
Tsar
's
secret
agent
while
he
was
still
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
read
it
through
;
then
stared
thoughtfully
up
at
the
ceiling
.
 
<EOS>
The
message
,
in
code
,
from
Berlin
,
stated
that
a
draft
of
a
most
important
treaty
between
Germany
and
England
had
been
despatched
from
the
German
Foreign
Office
,
and
would
arrive
in
London
that
day
.
<EOS>
The
message
concluded
with
the
words
,
"
It
is
imperative
that
we
should
have
a
copy
of
this
document
,
or
at
least
a
summary
of
its
contents
,
immediately
.
"
 
<EOS>
Although
sent
from
Berlin
,
the
Count
was
well
aware
that
it
was
an
order
from
the
Foreign
Minister
in
St.
Petersburg
,
<EOS>
the
message
being
transmitted
to
Berlin
first
,
and
then
retransmitted
to
London
,
in
order
to
avoid
any
suspicion
that
might
arise
in
the
case
of
messages
exchanged
direct
with
the
Russian
capital
.
<EOS>
Having
read
the
telegram
through
several
times
,
he
whistled
to
himself
,
rose
quickly
,
dressed
,
and
breakfasted
.
<EOS>
While
having
his
meal
,
he
gave
some
instructions
to
Grevel
,
his
valet
,
and
sent
him
out
upon
an
errand
,
at
the
same
time
expressing
his
intention
of
waiting
in
until
his
return
.
 
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
"
the
Count
said
,
as
his
man
was
going
out
,
"
be
careful
to
arouse
no
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Simply
make
your
inquiries
in
the
proper
quarter
,
and
come
back
immediately
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
,
as
Geoffrey
Engleheart
was
busy
writing
alone
in
his
room
at
the
Foreign
Office
,
he
was
interrupted
by
the
opening
of
the
door
.
 
<EOS>
"
Hulloa
,
dear
boy
!
<EOS>
I
've
found
my
way
up
here
by
myself
.
<EOS>
Busy
,
as
usual
,
I
see
!
<EOS>
"
cried
a
cheery
voice
as
the
door
slowly
opened
,
and
Geoffrey
looking
up
saw
it
was
his
friend
the
Count
,
well
groomed
and
fashionably
attired
in
glossy
silk
hat
,
perfect
-
fitting
frock
coat
,
and
varnished
boots
.
<EOS>
He
called
very
frequently
upon
Engleheart
,
and
had
long
ago
placed
himself
on
excellent
terms
with
the
messengers
and
doorkeepers
,
who
looked
upon
him
as
a
most
generous
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
Engleheart
exclaimed
,
rising
and
shaking
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
really
forgive
me
,
Count
,
but
I
quite
forgot
my
appointment
with
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
,
pray
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
a
glance
at
the
paper
till
you
've
finished
,
"
and
casting
himself
into
a
chair
near
the
window
he
took
up
the
_
Times
_
and
was
soon
absorbed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
in
silence
,
while
Engleheart
wrote
on
,
calmly
unconscious
that
there
was
a
small
rent
in
the
newspaper
the
Count
was
reading
,
and
that
through
it
he
could
plainly
see
each
word
of
the
treaty
as
it
was
transcribed
from
the
secret
code
and
written
down
in
plain
English
.
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
excuse
me
for
ten
minutes
?
"
<EOS>
Geoffrey
exclaimed
presently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Cabinet
Council
is
sitting
,
and
I
have
to
run
over
to
see
Lord
Stanbury
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
After
I
return
I
must
make
another
copy
of
this
paper
,
and
then
I
shall
be
free
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
Count
,
casting
the
newspaper
wearily
aside
,
glanced
at
his
watch
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
's
half
-
past
one
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
be
another
half
-
hour
,
if
not
more
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
really
think
,
old
fellow
,
I
'll
go
on
down
to
Hurlingham
.
<EOS>
I
arranged
to
meet
the
Vaynes
at
two
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
right
.
<EOS>
I
'll
run
down
in
a
cab
as
soon
as
I
can
get
away
,
"
answered
Engleheart
.
 
<EOS>
"
Good
.
<EOS>
Come
on
as
soon
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
Violet
will
be
expecting
you
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Of
course
I
shall
,
"
replied
his
unsuspicious
friend
,
and
they
shook
hands
,
after
which
the
Count
put
on
his
hat
and
sauntered
jauntily
out
.
 
<EOS>
In
Parliament
Street
he
jumped
into
his
phaeton
,
but
instead
of
driving
to
Hurlingham
gave
his
man
orders
to
proceed
with
all
speed
to
the
General
Post
Office
,
St.
Martin's
-
le
-
Grand
.
<EOS>
Within
half
an
hour
from
the
time
he
had
shaken
the
hand
of
his
unsuspecting
friend
,
a
message
in
code
--
to
all
intents
and
purposes
a
commercial
despatch
--
was
on
its
way
to
"
Herr
Brandt
,
116
Friedrich
Strasse
,
Berlin
.
"
 
<EOS>
That
message
contained
an
exact
transcript
of
the
secret
treaty
!

THE
RUSSIAN
SPY
'S
TELEGRAM
.
]
 
<EOS>
Almost
immediately
after
the
Count
had
left
,
Geoffrey
made
a
discovery
.
<EOS>
From
the
floor
he
picked
up
a
small
gold
pencil
-
case
which
he
knew
belonged
to
von
Beilstein
.
 
<EOS>
Engleheart
was
sorely
puzzled
to
know
why
the
Count
should
require
a
pencil
if
not
to
write
,
and
it
momentarily
flashed
across
his
mind
that
he
might
have
copied
portions
of
the
treaty
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
minute
he
dismissed
the
suspicion
as
ungrounded
and
preposterous
,
and
placing
the
pencil
in
his
pocket
went
in
search
of
Lord
Stanbury
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
statement
he
read
in
the
_
People
_
later
,
alleging
treachery
at
the
Foreign
Office
,
that
recalled
the
incident
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Then
the
horrible
truth
dawned
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
how
probable
it
was
that
he
had
been
tricked
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
mine
was
already
laid
;
that
the
only
thing
that
had
prevented
an
explosion
that
would
shake
the
whole
world
had
been
the
absence
of
definite
knowledge
as
to
the
exact
terms
of
the
alliance
between
England
,
Germany
,
Italy
,
and
Austria

on
our
southern
and
eastern
shores
spent
a
terribly
anxious
time
,
peering
from
their
points
of
vantage
out
into
the
cavernous
darkness
where
no
light
glimmered
.
<EOS>
The
Harbour
Defence
Flotilla
was
in
readiness
,
and
under
the
black
cliffs
sentinels
kept
watch
with
every
nerve
strained
to
its
highest
tension
,
for
the
safety
of
England
now
depended
upon
their
alertness
.
<EOS>
The
great
waves
crashed
and
roared
,
and
the
mist
,
obscuring
the
light
of
vessels
passing
up
and
down
the
Channel
,
seemed
to
grow
more
dense
as
the
hours
wore
on
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
feverish
excitement
that
had
spread
everywhere
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
,
the
troops
were
,
a
couple
of
hours
after
the
receipt
of
the
alarming
news
in
London
,
already
being
mobilised
and
on
their
way
south
and
east
by
special
trains
.
<EOS>
Men
,
arms
,
ammunition
,
and
stores
were
hurried
forward
to
repel
attack
,
and
in
the
War
Office
and
Admiralty
,
where
the
staffs
had
been
suddenly
called
together
,
the
greatest
activity
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Messages
had
been
flashed
along
the
wires
in
every
direction
giving
orders
to
mobilise
and
concentrate
at
certain
points
,
and
these
instructions
were
being
obeyed
with
that
promptness
for
which
British
soldiers
and
sailors
are
proverbial
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
high
officials
at
the
War
Office
looked
grave
,
and
although
affecting
unconcern
,
now
and
then
whispered
ominously
together
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
the
situation
was
critical
.
<EOS>
An
immediate
and
adequate
naval
defence
was
just
possible
,
but
the
Channel
Squadron
was
manoeuvring
off
the
Irish
coast
,
and
both
the
Coastguard
Squadron
and
the
Steam
Reserve
at
the
home
ports
were
very
weak
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
our
land
army
that
we
had
to
trust
,
and
they
were
divided
in
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
to
mobilise
a
sufficient
force
in
time
to
bar
the
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Military
experts
did
not
overlook
the
fact
that
to
Dunkirk
,
Calais
,
Boulogne
,
Dieppe
,
Fecamp
,
Havre
,
Honfleur
,
and
Cherbourg
ran
excellent
lines
of
railway
,
with
ample
rolling
-
stock
,
all
Government
property
,
and
at
the
beck
and
call
of
the
French
War
Minister
.
<EOS>
In
the
various
ports
there
was
adequate
wharf
accommodation
and
plenty
of
steam
tonnage
.
<EOS>
From
the
brief
official
despatches
received
from
Paris
before
the
cutting
of
the
wires
,
it
was
apparent
that
the
French
War
Office
had
laid
its
plans
with
much
forethought
and
cunning
,
and
had
provided
against
any
_
contretemps
_
.
<EOS>
An
army
of
carpenters
and
engineers
had
been
put
to
work
in
the
ports
to
alter
the
fittings
of
such
of
the
merchant
steamers
as
were
destined
to
convey
horses
,
and
these
fittings
,
prepared
beforehand
,
were
already
in
position
.
<EOS>
Four
army
corps
had
for
several
weeks
been
manoeuvring
in
Normandy
,
so
that
the
Reservists
had
become
accustomed
to
their
work
,
and
in
excellent
condition
for
war
;
therefore
these
facts
,
coupled
with
the
strong
support
certain
to
be
rendered
by
the
warships
of
the
Tsar
,
led
experts
to
regard
the
outlook
as
exceedingly
gloomy
.
 
<EOS>
For
years
military
and
naval
men
had
discussed
the
possibilities
of
invasion
,
haggled
over
controversial
points
,
but
had
never
arrived
at
any
definite
opinion
as
to
the
possibility
of
an
enemy
's
success
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
the
defences
of
the
country
were
to
be
tested
.
 
<EOS>
Our
great
Empire
was
at
stake
.
 
<EOS>
The
power
of
steam
to
cause
rapid
transit
by
land
and
sea
,
the
uncertainty
of
the
place
of
disembarkment
,
and
the
great
weight
of
modern
naval
artillery
,
combined
to
render
the
defences
of
England
on
the
coast
itself
most
uncertain
and
hazardous
,
and
to
cause
grave
doubts
to
arise
in
the
minds
of
those
who
at
that
critical
moment
were
directing
the
forward
movement
of
the
forces
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
public
,
whose
national
patriotism
found
vent
in
expressions
of
confidence
in
the
Regular
Army
and
Volunteers
,
were
ignorant
of
the
facts
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
two
great
Powers
had
combined
to
crush
our
island
stronghold
,
and
were
eager
that
hostilities
should
commence
in
order
that
the
enemy
should
be
taught
a
severe
lesson
for
their
presumption
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
knew
nothing
of
the
plain
truth
,
that
although
the
1st
Army
Corps
at
Aldershot
would
be
ready
to
move
at
a
few
hours
'
notice
,
yet
it
was
hopeless
to
try
and
prevent
the
disembarkation
of
the
French
army
corps
along
a
long
line
of
unprotected
coast
by
the
action
of
a
land
force
only
one
-
third
of
their
strength
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
by
the
water
's
edge
,
the
lonely
posts
were
kept
through
the
night
by
patient
,
keen
-
sighted
sentinels
,
ready
at
any
moment
to
raise
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
But
the
dense
mist
that
overhung
everything
was
tantalising
,
hiding
friend
and
foe
alike
,
and
no
sound
could
be
heard
above
the
heavy
roar
of
the
waters
as
they
rolled
in
over
the
rocks
.
 
<EOS>
London
,
infuriated
,
enthusiastic
,
turbulent
,
knew
no
sleep
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
was
at
fever
-
heat
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
soon
after
daybreak
,
there
came
the
first
news
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
warships
had
suddenly
appeared
through
the
fog
off
the
Sussex
coast
,
and
had
lost
no
time
in
asserting
their
presence
and
demanding
a
large
sum
from
the
Mayor
of
Newhaven
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
first
-
class
battery
cruiser
_
Tage
_
,
the
_
Devastation
_
,
the
_
Pothuau
_
,
the
_
Arethuse
_
and
others
,
finding
that
their
demand
was
unheeded
,
at
once
commenced
shelling
the
town
.
<EOS>
Although
our
Coastguard
Squadron
and
first
-
class
Steam
Reserve
had
mobilised
,
yet
they
had
received
orders
and
sailed
away
no
one
knew
whither
.
<EOS>
The
forts
replied
vigorously
,
but
the
fire
of
the
enemy
in
half
an
hour
had
wrought
terrible
havoc
both
in
the
town
and
in
the
forts
,
where
several
of
the
guns
had
been
rendered
useless
and
a
number
of
men
had
been
killed
.
<EOS>
Hostilities
had
commenced
.
 
<EOS>
Never
during
the
century
had
such
scenes
been
witnessed
in
the
streets
of
London
as
on
that
memorable
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
The
metropolis
was
thrilled
.
 
<EOS>
Dawn
was
spreading
,
saffron
tints
were
in
the
sky
heralding
the
sun
's
coming
.
<EOS>
Yet
Regent
Street
,
Piccadilly
,
and
the
Strand
,
usually
entirely
deserted
at
that
hour
on
a
Sabbath
morning
,
were
crowded
as
if
it
were
midday
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
there
was
excitement
.
<EOS>
Crowds
waited
in
front
of
the
newspaper
offices
in
Fleet
Street
,
boys
with
strident
voices
sold
the
latest
editions
of
the
papers
,
men
continued
their
snatches
of
patriotic
ballads
,
while
women
were
blanched
and
scared
,
and
children
clung
to
their
mothers
'
skirts
timidly
,
vaguely
fearing
an
unknown
terror
.
 
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
coming
events
was
black
and
dim
,
like
a
funeral
pall
.
<EOS>
The
fate
of
our
Empire
hung
upon
a
thread
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
-
four
hours
ago
England
was
smiling
,
<EOS>
content
in
the
confidence
of
its
perfect
safety
and
immunity
from
invasion
;
yet
all
the
horrors
of
war
had
,
with
a
startling
,
appalling
suddenness
,
fallen
and
bewildered
it
.
<EOS>
The
booming
of
French
cannon
at
Newhaven
formed
the
last
salute
of
many
a
brave
Briton
who
fell
shattered
and
lifeless
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sun
rose
crimson
from
the
grey
misty
sea
,
the
work
of
destruction
increased
in
vigour
.
<EOS>
From
the
turrets
of
the
floating
monsters
smoke
and
flame
poured
forth
in
continuous
volume
,
while
shot
and
shell
were
hurled
into
the
town
of
Newhaven
,
which
,
it
was
apparent
,
was
the
centre
of
the
enemy
's
attack
,
and
where
,
owing
to
the
deepening
of
the
harbour
,
troops
could
effect
a
landing
under
cover
of
the
fire
from
the
ironclads
.
 
<EOS>
Frightful
havoc
was
wrought
by
the
shells
among
the
houses
of
the
little
town
,
and
one
falling
on
board
the
Brighton
Railway
Company
's
mail
steamer
_
Paris
_
,
lying
alongside
the
station
quay
,
set
her
on
fire
.
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
railway
station
and
quays
were
blazing
furiously
,
while
the
flames
leaped
up
about
the
ship
,
wrapping
themselves
about
the
two
white
funnels
and
darting
from
every
porthole
.
 
<EOS>
The
Custom
House
opposite
quickly
ignited
,
and
the
inflammable
nature
of
its
contents
caused
the
fire
to
assume
enormous
proportions
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
bombardment
was
kept
up
,
the
forts
on
shore
still
replying
with
regularity
,
steadiness
,
and
precision
,
and
the
armoured
coast
train
of
the
1st
Sussex
Artillery
Volunteers
,
under
Captain
Brigden
,
rendering
excellent
service
.
<EOS>
In
one
of
the
forts
a
man
was
standing
in
front
of
a
small
camera
-
obscura
,
on
the
glass
of
which
were
a
number
of
mysterious
marks
.
<EOS>
This
glass
reflected
the
water
and
the
ships
;
and
as
he
stood
by
calmly
with
his
hand
upon
a
keyboard
,
he
watched
the
reflections
of
the
hostile
vessels
moving
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
glass
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
he
saw
a
French
gunboat
,
after
a
series
of
smartly
-
executed
manoeuvres
,
steaming
straight
over
one
of
the
marks
,
and
,
quick
as
lightning
,
his
finger
pressed
one
of
the
electric
keys
.
<EOS>
A
terrific
explosion
followed
,
and
a
column
of
green
water
shot
up
at
the
same
instant
.
<EOS>
The
gunboat
_
Lavel
_
had
been
suddenly
blown
almost
out
of
the
water
by
a
submarine
mine
!
<EOS>
Broken
portions
of
her
black
hull
turned
over
and
sank
,
and
<EOS>
mangled
remains
of
what
a
second
before
had
been
a
crew
of
enthusiastic
Frenchmen
floated
for
a
few
moments
on
the
surface
,
then
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Not
a
soul
on
board
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
Along
the
telegraph
line
from
the
signal
-
station
on
Beachy
Head
news
of
the
blowing
up
of
the
enemy
's
gunboat
was
flashed
to
London
,
and
when
,
an
hour
later
,
it
appeared
in
the
newspapers
,
the
people
went
half
mad
with
excitement
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
how
they
miscalculated
the
relative
strength
of
the
opposing
forces
!
 
<EOS>
They
were
unaware
that
our
Channel
Fleet
,
our
Coastguard
Squadron
,
and
our
Reserve
were
steaming
away
,
leaving
our
southern
shores
_
practically
unprotected
_
!

CHAPTER
VI
.
 
<EOS>
LANDING
OF
THE
FRENCH
IN
SUSSEX
.
  
<EOS>
The
Briton
is
,
alas
!
<EOS>
too
prone
to
underrate
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
It
is
this
national
egotism
,
this
fatal
over
-
confidence
,
that
has
led
to
most
of
the
reverses
we
have
sustained
in
recent
wars
.
 
<EOS>
The
popular
belief
that
one
Briton
is
as
good
as
half
a
dozen
foreigners
,
is
a
fallacy
which
ought
to
be
at
once
expunged
from
the
minds
of
every
one
.
<EOS>
The
improved
and
altered
conditions
under
which
international
hostilities
are
carried
on
nowadays
scarcely
even
admit
of
a
hand
-
to
-
hand
encounter
,
and
the
engines
of
destruction
designed
by
other
European
Powers
being
quite
as
perfect
as
our
own
,
tact
and
cunning
have
now
taken
the
place
of
pluck
and
perseverance
.
<EOS>
The
strong
arm
avails
but
<EOS>
little
in
modern
warfare
;
strategy
is
everything
.
 
<EOS>
Into
Brighton
,
an
hour
after
dawn
,
the
enemy
's
vessels
were
pouring
volley
after
volley
of
deadly
missiles
.
<EOS>
A
party
had
landed
from
the
French
flagship
,
and
,
summoning
the
Mayor
,
had
demanded
a
million
pounds
.
<EOS>
This
not
being
forthcoming
,
they
had
commenced
shelling
the
town
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
,
for
the
most
part
,
directed
against
the
long
line
of
shops
and
private
residences
in
King
's
Road
and
at
Hove
,
and
in
half
an
hour
over
a
hundred
houses
had
been
demolished
.
<EOS>
The
palatial
Hotel
Metropole
stood
a
great
gaunt
ruin
.
<EOS>
Shells
had
carried
large
portions
of
the
noble
building
away
,
and
a
part
of
the
ruin
had
caught
fire
and
was
burning
unchecked
,
threatening
to
consume
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Church
steeples
had
been
knocked
over
like
ninepins
,
and
explosive
missiles
dropped
in
the
centre
of
the
town
every
moment
,
sweeping
the
streets
with
deadly
effect
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
met
with
little
or
no
opposition
.
<EOS>
Our
first
line
of
defence
,
our
Navy
,
was
missing
!
<EOS>
The
Admiralty
were
unaware
of
the
whereabouts
of
three
whole
Fleets
that
had
mobilised
,
and
the
ships
remaining
in
the
Channel
,
exclusive
of
the
Harbour
Defence
Flotilla
,
were
practically
useless
.
 
<EOS>
At
Eastbourne
,
likewise
,
where
a
similar
demand
had
been
made
,
shot
fell
thick
as
hail
,
and
shells
played
fearful
havoc
with
the
handsome
boarding
-
houses
and
hotels
that
line
the
sea
front
.
<EOS>
From
the
redoubt
,
the
Wish
Tower
,
and
a
battery
on
the
higher
ground
towards
Beachy
Head
,
as
well
as
a
number
of
other
hastily
constructed
earthworks
,
a
reply
was
made
to
the
enemy
's
fire
,
and
the
guns
in
the
antiquated
martello
towers
,
placed
at
intervals
along
the
beach
,
now
and
then
sent
a
shot
towards
the
vessels
.
<EOS>
But
such
an
attempt
to
keep
the
great
ironclads
at
bay
was
absurdly
futile
.
<EOS>
One
after
another
shells
from
the
monster
guns
of
the
Russian
ship
_
Pjotr
Velikij
_
,
and
the
armoured
cruisers
_
Gerzog
Edinburskij
_
,
_
Krejser
_
,
and
_
Najezdnik
_
,
crashed
into
these
out
-
of
-
date
coast
defences
,
and
effectually
silenced
them
.
<EOS>
In
Eastbourne
itself
the
damage
wrought
was
enormous
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
shells
fell
and
exploded
in
Terminus
and
Seaside
Roads
,
while
the
aristocratic
suburb
of
Upperton
,
built
on
the
hill
behind
the
town
,
was
exposed
to
and
bore
the
full
brunt
of
the
fray
.
<EOS>
The
fine
modern
Queen
Anne
and
Elizabethan
residences
were
soon
mere
heaps
of
burning
debris
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
houses
fell
,
burying
their
occupants
,
and
those
people
who
rushed
out
into
the
roads
for
safety
were
,
for
the
most
part
,
either
overwhelmed
by
debris
,
or
had
their
limbs
shattered
by
flying
pieces
of
shell
.
 
<EOS>
The
situation
was
awful
.
<EOS>
The
incessant
thunder
of
cannon
,
the
screaming
of
shells
whizzing
through
the
air
,
to
burst
a
moment
later
and
send
a
dozen
or
more
persons
to
an
untimely
grave
,
the
crash
of
falling
walls
,
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
dust
,
and
the
blazing
of
ignited
wreckage
,
combined
to
produce
a
scene
more
terrible
than
any
witnessed
in
England
during
the
present
century
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
was
the
outcome
of
one
man
's
indiscretion
and
the
cunning
duplicity
of
two
others
!
 
<EOS>
At
high
noon
Newhaven
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
The
attack
had
been
so
entirely
unexpected
that
the
troops
mobilised
and
sent
there
<EOS>
had
arrived
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
town
was
being
sacked
,
and
the
harbour
was
in
the
possession
of
the
French
,
who
were
landing
their
forces
in
great
numbers
.
<EOS>
From
Dieppe
and
Havre
transports
were
arriving
,
and
discharging
their
freights
of
fighting
men
and
guns
under
cover
of
the
fire
from
the
French
warships
lying
close
in
land
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
the
steps
taken
during
the
last
twenty
years
to
improve
the
condition
of
our
forces
on
land
and
sea
,
this
outbreak
of
hostilities
found
us
far
from
being
in
a
state
of
preparedness
for
war
.
<EOS>
England
,
strangely
enough
,
has
never
yet
fully
realised
that
the
conditions
of
war
have
entirely
changed
.
<EOS>
In
days
gone
by
,
when
troops
and
convoys
could
move
but
slowly
,
the
difficulty
of
providing
for
armies
engaged
in
operations
necessarily
limited
their
strength
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
quite
different
.
<EOS>
Improved
communications
have
given
to
military
operations
astonishing
rapidity
,
and
the
facilities
with
which
large
masses
of
troops
,
guns
,
and
stores
can
now
be
transported
to
great
distances
has
had
the
effect
of
proportionately
increasing
numbers
.
<EOS>
As
a
result
of
this
,
with
the
exception
of
our
own
island
,
Europe
was
armed
to
the
teeth
.
<EOS>
Yet
a
mobilisation
arrangement
that
was
faulty
and
not
clearly
understood
by
officers
or
men
,
was
the
cause
of
the
enemy
being
allowed
to
land
.
<EOS>
It
is
remarkable
that
the
military
authorities
had
not
acted
upon
the
one
principle
admitted
on
every
side
,
namely
,
that
the
only
effective
defence
consists
of
attack
.
<EOS>
The
attack
,
to
succeed
,
should
have
been
sudden
and
opportune
,
and
the
Army
should
have
been
so
organised
that
on
the
occurrence
of
war
a
force
of
adequate
strength
would
have
been
at
once
available
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
we
missed
our
chance
to
secure
this
inestimable
advantage
afforded
by
the
power
of
striking
the
first
blow
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
an
old
and
true
saying
,
that
"
England
's
best
bulwarks
were
her
wooden
walls
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
no
longer
wooden
,
but
it
still
remains
an
admitted
fact
that
England
's
strongest
bulwarks
should
be
her
Navy
,
and
that
any
other
nation
may
be
possessed
of
an
equally
good
one
;
also
that
our
best
bulwark
should
be
equal
to
,
or
approach
,
the
fighting
power
of
the
bulwarks
owned
by
any
two
possible
hostile
nations
.
 
<EOS>
To
be
strong
is
to
stave
off
war
;
to
be
weak
is
to
invite
attack
.
<EOS>
It
was
our
policy
of
_
laissez
faire
_
,
a
weak
Navy
and
an
Army
bound
up
with
red
tape
,
that
caused
this
disastrous
invasion
of
England
.
<EOS>
Had
our
Fleet
been
sufficient
for
its
work
,
invasion
would
have
remained
a
threat
,
and
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Our
Navy
was
not
only
our
first
,
but
our
last
line
of
defence
from
an
Imperial
point
of
view
;
for
,
as
a
writer
in
the
_
Army
and
Navy
Gazette
_
pointed
out
in
1893
,
it
was
equally
manifest
and
unquestionable
that
without
land
forces
to
act
as
the
spearhead
to
the
Navy
's
over
-
sea
shaft
,
the
offensive
tactics
so
essential
to
a
thorough
statesmanlike
defensive
policy
could
not
be
carried
out
.
<EOS>
Again
,
the
mobility
and
efficiency
of
our
Regular
Army
should
have
been
such
that
the
victory
of
our
Fleet
could
be
speedily
and
vigorously
followed
by
decisive
blows
on
the
enemy
's
territory
.
 
<EOS>
Already
the
news
of
the
landing
of
the
enemy
had
--
besides
causing
a
thrill
such
as
had
never
before
been
known
in
our
"
tight
little
island"--produced
its
effect
upon
the
price
of
food
in
London
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
In
England
we
had
only
five
days
'
bread
-
stuffs
,
and
as
the
majority
of
our
supplies
came
from
Russia
the
price
of
bread
trebled
within
twelve
hours
,
and
the
ordinary
necessaries
of
life
were
proportionately
dearer
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
dice
had
been
thrown
,
and
the
sixes
lay
with
Moloch
.

CHAPTER
VII
.
 
<EOS>
BOMB
OUTRAGES
IN
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
Sunday
,
scenes
were
witnessed
in
the
metropolis
which
were
of
the
most
disgraceful
character
.
<EOS>
The
teeming
city
,
from
dawn
till
midnight
,
was
in
a
feverish
turmoil
,
the
throngs
in
its
streets
discussing
the
probable
turn
of
affairs
,
singing
patriotic
songs
,
and
giving
vent
to
utterances
of
heroic
intentions
interspersed
with
much
horse
play
.
 
<EOS>
In
Trafalgar
Square
,
the
hub
of
London
,
a
mass
meeting
of
Anarchists
and
Socialists
was
held
,
at
which
the
Government
and
military
authorities
were
loudly
denounced
for
what
was
termed
their
criminal
apathy
to
the
interests
and
welfare
of
the
nation
.
<EOS>
The
Government
,
it
was
contended
,
had
betrayed
the
country
by
allowing
the
secret
of
the
German
alliance
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
its
enemies
,
and
the
Ministers
,
adjudged
unworthy
the
confidence
of
the
nation
,
were
by
the
resolutions
adopted
called
upon
to
resign
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
crisis
was
an
excuse
for
Anarchism
to
vent
its
grievances
against
law
and
order
,
and
,
unshackled
,
it
had
spread
with
rapidity
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
In
"
The
Square
"
the
scarlet
flag
and
the
Cap
of
Liberty
were
everywhere
in
evidence
,
and
,
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
the
police
,
the
leaders
of
Anarchy
openly
advocated
outrage
,
incendiarism
,
and
murder
.
<EOS>
At
length
the
police
resolved
to
interfere
,
and
this
was
the
signal
for
a
terrible
uprising
.
<EOS>
The
huge
mob
,
which
in
the
mellow
sunset
filled
the
great
Square
and
blocked
all
its
approaches
,
became
a
seething
,
surging
mass
of
struggling
humanity
.
<EOS>
The
attack
by
the
police
,
who
were
ordered
to
disperse
them
,
only
incensed
them
further
against
the
authorities
,
whom
they
blamed
for
the
catastrophe
that
had
befallen
our
country
.
<EOS>
Angry
and
desperate
<EOS>
they
fought
with
the
police
,
using
both
revolvers
and
knives
.
 
<EOS>
The
scene
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
The
scum
of
the
metropolis
had
congregated
to
wage
war
against
their
own
compatriots
whom
they
classed
among
enemies
,
and
for
an
hour
in
the
precincts
of
the
Square
the
struggle
was
for
life
.
<EOS>
Dozens
of
constables
were
shot
dead
,
hundreds
of
Anarchists
and
Socialists
received
wounds
from
batons
,
many
succumbing
to
their
injuries
,
or
being
trampled
to
death
by
the
dense
mob
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
repetition
of
that
historic
day
known
as
"
Bloody
Sunday
,
"
only
the
fight
was
more
desperate
and
the
consequences
far
worse
,
and
such
as
would
disgrace
any
civilised
city
.
 
<EOS>
Before
sundown
the
police
had
been
vanquished
;
and
as
no
soldiers
could
be
spared
,
Anarchism
ran
riot
in
the
Strand
,
Pall
Mall
,
St.
Martin
's
Lane
,
Northumberland
Avenue
,
and
Parliament
Street
.
<EOS>
Pale
,
determined
men
,
with
faces
covered
with
blood
,
and
others
with
their
clothes
in
shreds
,
shouted
hoarse
cries
of
victory
,
as
,
headed
by
a
torn
red
flag
,
they
rushed
into
Pall
Mall
and
commenced
breaking
down
the
shutters
of
shops
and
looting
them
.
<EOS>
Men
were
knocked
down
and
murdered
,
and
the
rioters
,
freed
from
all
restraint
,
commenced
sacking
all
establishments
where
it
was
expected
spoil
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
At
one
bank
in
Pall
Mall
they
succeeded
,
after
some
difficulty
,
in
breaking
open
the
strong
room
with
explosives
,
and
some
forty
or
fifty
of
the
rebels
with
eager
greediness
shared
the
gold
and
notes
they
stole
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
Strand
corner
of
the
Square
a
squad
of
police
was
being
formed
,
in
order
to
co
-
operate
with
some
reinforcements
which
were
arriving
,
when
suddenly
there
was
a
terrific
explosion
.
 
<EOS>
A
bomb
filled
with
picric
acid
had
been
thrown
by
an
Anarchist
,
and
when
the
smoke
cleared
,
the
shattered
remains
of
thirty
-
four
constables
lay
strewn
upon
the
roadway
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
but
<EOS>
the
first
of
a
series
of
dastardly
outrages
.
<EOS>
The
advice
of
the
Anarchist
leaders
in
their
inflammatory
speeches
had
been
acted
upon
,
and
in
half
an
hour
a
number
of
bomb
explosions
had
occurred
in
the
vicinity
,
each
doing
enormous
damage
,
and
killing
numbers
of
innocent
persons
.
<EOS>
After
the
petard
had
been
thrown
in
Trafalgar
Square
a
loud
explosion
was
almost
immediately
afterwards
heard
in
Parliament
Street
,
and
it
was
soon
known
that
a
too
successful
attempt
had
been
made
to
blow
up
the
Premier
's
official
residence
in
Downing
Street
.
<EOS>
The
programme
of
the
outrages
had
apparently
been
organised
,
for
almost
before
the
truth
was
known
another
even
more
disastrous
explosion
occurred
in
the
vestibule
of
the
War
Office
in
Pall
Mall
,
which
wrecked
the
lower
part
of
the
building
,
and
blew
to
atoms
the
sentry
on
duty
,
and
killed
a
number
of
clerks
who
were
busy
at
their
important
duties
in
the
apartments
on
the
ground
floor
.
 
<EOS>
Through
Pall
Mall
and
along
Whitehall
<EOS>
the
mob
ran
,
crying
"
Down
with
the
Government
!
<EOS>
Kill
the
traitors
!
<EOS>
Kill
them
!
"
<EOS>
About
three
thousand
of
the
more
lawless
,
having
looted
a
number
of
shops
,
rushed
to
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
arriving
there
just
in
time
to
witness
the
frightful
havoc
caused
by
the
explosion
of
two
terribly
powerful
bombs
that
had
been
placed
in
St.
Stephen
's
Hall
and
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
A
section
of
the
exultant
rioters
had
gained
access
to
the
National
Gallery
,
where
they
carried
on
ruthless
destruction
among
the
priceless
paintings
there
.
<EOS>
Dozens
of
beautiful
works
were
slashed
with
knives
,
others
were
torn
down
,
and
many
,
cut
from
their
frames
,
were
flung
to
the
howling
crowd
outside
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
some
one
screamed
,
"
What
do
we
want
with
Art
?
<EOS>
Burn
down
the
useless
palace
!
<EOS>
Burn
it
!
<EOS>
Burn
it
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
cry
was
taken
up
by
thousands
of
throats
,
and
on
every
hand
the
rebels
inside
the
building
were
urged
to
set
fire
to
it
.
<EOS>
Intoxicated
with
success
,
maddened
by
anger
at
the
action
of
the
police
,
and
confident
that
they
had
gained
a
signal
victory
over
the
law
,
they
piled
together
a
number
of
historic
paintings
in
one
of
the
rooms
,
and
then
ignited
them
.
<EOS>
The
flames
leaped
to
the
ceiling
,
spread
to
the
woodwork
,
and
thence
,
with
appalling
rapidity
,
to
the
other
apartments
.
<EOS>
The
windows
cracked
,
and
clouds
of
smoke
and
tongues
of
fire
belched
forth
from
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
now
grown
dusk
.
<EOS>
The
furious
,
demoniacal
rabble
surging
in
the
Square
set
up
loud
,
prolonged
cheering
when
they
saw
the
long
dark
building
burning
.
<EOS>
In
delight
they
paused
in
their
work
of
destruction
,
watching
the
flames
growing
brighter
as
they
burst
through
the
roof
,
licking
the
central
dome
;
and
while
the
timber
crackled
and
the
fire
roared
,
casting
a
lurid
glare
upon
the
tall
buildings
round
and
lighting
up
the
imposing
facade
of
the
Grand
Hotel
<EOS>
,
they
cheered
vociferously
and
sang
the
"
Marseillaise
"
until
the
smoke
half
choked
them
and
their
throats
grew
hoarse
.
 
<EOS>
These
denizens
of
the
slums
,
these
criminal
crusaders
against
the
law
,
were
not
yet
satiated
by
their
wild
reckless
orgies
.
<EOS>
Unchecked
,
they
had
run
riot
up
and
down
the
Strand
,
and
there
was
scarcely
a
man
among
them
who
had
not
in
his
pocket
some
of
the
spoils
from
jewellers
'
or
from
banks
.
<EOS>
In
the
glare
of
the
flames
the
white
bloodstained
faces
wore
a
determined
expression
as
they
stood
collecting
their
energies
for
some
other
atrocious
outrage
against
their
so
-
called
enemies
,
the
rich
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
first
menace
of
excesses
,
dwellers
in
the
locality
had
left
their
houses
and
fled
headlong
for
safety
to
other
parts
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
majority
escaped
,
but
many
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
rioters
,
and
were
treated
with
scant
humanity
.
<EOS>
Men
and
women
were
struck
down
and
robbed
,
even
strangled
or
shot
if
they
resisted
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
frightful
--
a
terrible
realisation
of
Anarchist
prophecies
that
had
rendered
the
authorities
absolutely
helpless
.
<EOS>
On
the
one
hand
,
an
enemy
had
landed
on
our
shores
with
every
chance
of
a
successful
march
to
London
,
while
on
the
other
the
revolutionary
spirit
had
broken
out
unmistakably
among
the
criminal
class
,
and
lawlessness
and
murder
were
everywhere
rife
.
 
<EOS>
The
homes
of
the
people
were
threatened
by
double
disaster
--
by
the
attack
of
both
enemy
and
"
friend
.
"
<EOS>
The
terrible
bomb
outrages
and
their
appalling
results
had
completely
disorganised
the
police
,
and
although
reinforcements
had
been
telegraphed
for
from
every
division
in
London
,
the
number
of
men
mustered
at
Scotland
Yard
was
not
yet
sufficient
to
deal
effectually
with
the
irate
and
rapidly
increasing
mob
.
 
<EOS>
As
evening
wore
on
the
scenes
in
the
streets
around
the
Square
were
terrible
.
<EOS>
Pall
Mall
was
congested
by
the
angry
mob
who
were
wrecking
the
clubs
,
when
suddenly
the
exultant
cries
were
succeeded
by
terrified
shrieks
mingled
with
fierce
oaths
.
<EOS>
Each
man
fought
with
his
neighbour
,
and
many
men
and
women
,
crushed
against
iron
railings
,
stood
half
suffocated
and
helpless
.
<EOS>
The
National
Gallery
was
burning
fiercely
,
flames
from
the
great
burning
pile
shot
high
in
the
air
,
illuminating
everything
with
their
flood
of
crimson
light
,
and
the
wind
,
blowing
down
the
crowded
thoroughfare
,
carried
smoke
,
sparks
,
and
heat
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
Distant
shrieks
were
heard
in
the
direction
of
the
Square
,
and
suddenly
the
crowd
surged
wildly
forward
.
<EOS>
Gaol
-
birds
from
the
purlieus
of
Drury
Lane
robbed
those
who
had
valuables
or
money
upon
them
,
and
committed
brutal
assaults
upon
the
unprotected
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
,
however
,
there
was
a
flash
,
and
the
deafening
sound
of
firearms
at
close
quarters
was
followed
by
the
horrified
shrieks
of
the
yelling
mob
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
the
sound
was
repeated
.
<EOS>
Around
them
bullets
whistled
,
and
men
and
women
fell
forward
dead
and
wounded
with
terrible
curses
upon
their
lips
.
 
<EOS>
The
10th
Hussars
had
just
arrived
from
Hounslow
,
and
having
received
hurried
orders
to
clear
away
the
rioters
,
were
shooting
them
down
like
dogs
,
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
On
every
hand
cries
of
agony
and
despair
rose
above
the
tumult

<EOS>
Then
a
silence
followed
,
for
the
street
was
thickly
strewn
with
corpses

CHAPTER

<EOS>
FATEFUL
DAYS
FOR
THE
OLD
FLAG
.
  
<EOS>
A
cloudy
moonless
night
,
with
a
gusty
wind
which
now
and
then
swept
the
tops
of
the
forest
trees
,
causing
the
leaves
to
surge
like
a
summer
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Withered
branches
creaked
and
groaned
,
and
a
dog
howled
dismally
down
in
Flimwell
village
,
half
a
mile
away
.
<EOS>
Leaning
with
his
back
against
the
gnarled
trunk
of
a
giant
oak
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
,
his
ears
alert
for
the
slightest
sound
,
his
hand
upon
his
loaded
magazine
rifle
,
Geoffrey
Engleheart
stood
on
outpost
duty
.
<EOS>
Dressed
in
a
rough
shooting
suit
,
with
a
deerstalker
hat
and
an
improvised
kit
strapped
upon
his
back
,
he
was
half
hidden
by
the
tall
bracken
.
<EOS>
Standing
motionless
in
the
deep
shadow
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
wide
stretch
of
sloping
meadows
,
he
waited
,
ready
,
at
the
slightest
appearance
of
the
enemy
's
scouts
,
to
raise
the
alarm
and
call
to
arms
those
who
were
sleeping
in
the
forest
after
their
day
's
march
.
 
<EOS>
The
City
Civilian
Volunteer
Battalion
which
he
had
joined
was
on
its
way
to
take
part
in
the
conflict
,
which
every
one
knew
would
be
desperate
.
<EOS>
Under
the
command
of
Major
Mansford
,
an
experienced
elderly
officer
who
had
long
since
retired
from
the
Lancashire
Regiment
,
but
who
had
at
once
volunteered
to
lead
the
battalion
of
young
patriots
,
they
had
left
London
by
train
for
Maidstone
,
whence
they
marched
by
way
of
Linton
,
Marden
,
and
Goudhurst
to
Frith
Wood
,
where
they
had
bivouacked
for
the
night
on
the
Sussex
border
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
known
that
Russian
scouts
had
succeeded
in
getting
as
far
as
Wadhurst
,
and
it
was
expected
that
one
of
the
French
reconnoitring
parties
must
,
in
their
circuitous
survey
,
pass
the
border
of
the
wood
on
their
way
back
to
their
own
lines
.
<EOS>
Up
to
the
present
they
had
been
practically
unmolested
.
<EOS>
The
British
army
was
now
mobilised
,
and
Kent
,
Sussex
,
and
Hampshire
were
overrun
with
soldiers
.
<EOS>
Every
household
gave
men
accommodation
voluntarily
,
every
hostelry
,
from
the
aristocratic
hotels
of
the
watering
-
places
to
the
unassuming
Red
Lions
of
the
villages
,
was
full
of
Britain
's
brave
defenders
.
<EOS>
The
echoes
of
old
-
world
village
streets
of
thatched
houses
with
quaint
gables
were
awakened
night
and
day
by
the
rumbling
of
heavy
artillery
,
the
shouts
of
the
drivers
as
they
urged
along
their
teams
,
and
the
rattle
of
ammunition
carts
and
of
ambulance
waggons
,
while
on
every
high
road
leading
south
battalions
were
on
the
march
,
and
eager
to
come
within
fighting
range
of
the
audacious
foreigners
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
peaceful
people
of
the
villages
gazed
,
wondered
,
and
admired
,
thinking
some
manoeuvres
were
about
to
take
place
--
for
military
manoeuvres
always
improve
village
trade
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
very
quickly
disillusioned
.
<EOS>
When
they
knew
the
truth
--
that
the
enemy
was
actually
at
their
doors
,
that
the
grey
-
coated
masses
of
the
Russian
legions
were
lying
like
packs
of
wolves
in
the
undulating
country
between
Heathfield
,
Etchingham
,
and
the
sea
--
they
were
panic
-
stricken
and
appalled
.
<EOS>
They
watched
the
stream
of
redcoats
passing
their
doors
,
cheering
them
,
while
those
who
were
their
guests
were
treated
to
the
best
fare
their
hosts
could
provide
.
 
<EOS>
Tommy
Atkins
was
now
the
idol
of
the
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Apparently
the
enemy
,
having
established
themselves
,
were
by
no
means
anxious
to
advance
with
undue
haste
.
<EOS>
Having
landed
,
they
were
,
it
was
ascertained
,
awaiting
the
arrival
of
further
reinforcements
and
armaments
from
both
Powers
;
but
nothing
definite
was
known
of
this
,
except
some
meagre
details
that
had
filtered
through
the
American
cables
,
all
direct
telegraphic
communication
with
the
Continent
having
now
been
cut
off
.
 
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
Moloch
had
grinned
.
<EOS>
He
had
sharpened
his
sickle
for
the
terrible
carnage
that
was
to
spread
through
Albion
's
peaceful
land
.
 
<EOS>
Terrible
was
the
panic
that
the
invasion
had
produced
in
the
North
.
 
<EOS>
Food
had
risen
to
exorbitant
prices
.
<EOS>
In
the
great
manufacturing
centres
the
toiling
millions
were
already
feeling
the
pinch
of
starvation
,
for
with
bread
at
ninepence
a
small
loaf
,
meat
at
a
prohibitive
figure
,
and
the
factories
stopped
,
they
were
compelled
to
remain
with
empty
stomachs
and
idle
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Birmingham
,
Manchester
,
Liverpool
,
Newcastle
,
and
the
larger
towns
presented
a
gloomy
,
sorry
aspect
.
<EOS>
Business
was
suspended
,
the
majority
of
the
shops
were
closed
,
the
banks
barred
and
bolted
,
and
the
only
establishments
where
any
trade
flourished
were
the
taverns
and
music
halls
.
<EOS>
These
were
crowded
.
<EOS>
Drink
flowed
,
gold
jingled
,
and
the
laughter
at
wild
jest
or
the
thunder
of
applause
which
greeted
dancing
girls
and
comic
vocalists
was
still
as
hearty
as
of
old
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
there
was
a
sordid
craving
for
amusement
which
was
a
reflex
of
the
war
fever
.
<EOS>
The
people
made
merry
,
for
ere
long
they
might
be
cut
down
by
a
foeman
's
steel
.
 
<EOS>
Restless
impatience
thrilled
the
community
from
castle
to
cottage
,
intensified
by
the
vain
clamourings
of
Anarchist
mobs
in
the
greater
towns
.
<EOS>
As
in
London
,
these
shock
-
headed
agitators
held
high
revel
,
protesting
against
everything
and
everybody
--
now
railing
,
now
threatening
,
but
always
mustering
converts
to
their
harebrained
doctrines
.
<EOS>
In
Manchester
they
were
particularly
strong
.
<EOS>
A
number
of
serious
riots
had
occurred
in
Deansgate
and
in
Market
Street
.
<EOS>
The
mob
wrecked
the
Queen
's
Hotel
,
smashed
numbers
of
windows
in
Lewis
's
great
emporium
,
looted
the
_
Guardian
_
office
,
and
set
fire
to
the
Town
Hall
.
<EOS>
A
portion
of
the
latter
only
was
burned
,
the
fire
brigade
managing
to
subdue
the
flames
before
any
very
serious
damage
was
occasioned
.
<EOS>
Although
the
police
made
hundreds
of
arrests
,
and
the
stipendiary
sat
from
early
morning
until
late
at
night
,
Anarchist
demonstrations
were
held
every
evening
in
the
city
and
suburbs
,
always
resulting
in
pillage
,
incendiarism
,
and
not
unfrequently
in
murder
.
<EOS>
In
grey
,
money
-
making
Stockport
,
in
grimy
Salford
,
in
smoky
Pendleton
,
and
even
in
aristocratic
Eccles
,
these
demonstrations
were
held
,
and
the
self
-
styled
"
soldiers
of
the
social
revolution
"
marched
over
the
granite
roads
,
headed
by
a
dirty
scarlet
flag
,
hounding
down
the
Government
,
and
crying
shame
upon
them
for
the
apathy
with
which
they
had
regarded
the
presence
of
the
bearded
Caucasian
Tcherkesses
of
the
White
Tsar
.
 
<EOS>
The
kingdom
was
in
wild
turmoil
,
for
horror
heaped
upon
horror
.
<EOS>
Outrages
that
commenced
in
London
were
repeated
with
appalling
frequency
in
the
great
towns
in
the
provinces
.
<EOS>
An
attempt
had
been
made
to
assassinate
the
Premier
while
speaking
in
the
Town
Hall
,
Birmingham
,
the
bomb
which
was
thrown
having
killed
two
hard
-
working
reporters
who
were
writing
near
;
but
the
Prime
Minister
,
who
seemed
to
lead
a
charmed
existence
,
escaped
without
a
scratch
.
 
<EOS>
In
Liverpool
,
where
feeling
against
the
War
Office
ran
high
,
there
were
several
explosions
,
two
of
which
occurred
in
Bold
Street
,
and
were
attended
by
loss
of
life
,
while
a
number
of
incendiary
fires
occurred
at
the
docks
.
<EOS>
At
Bradford
the
Town
Hall
was
blown
up
,
and
the
troops
were
compelled
to
fire
on
a
huge
mob
of
rioters
,
who
,
having
assembled
at
Manningham
,
were
advancing
to
loot
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
cavalry
barracks
at
York
was
the
scene
of
a
terrific
explosion
,
which
killed
three
sentries
and
maimed
twenty
other
soldiers
;
while
at
Warwick
Assizes
,
during
the
hearing
of
a
murder
trial
,
some
unknown
scoundrel
threw
a
petard
at
the
judge
,
killing
him
instantly
on
the
bench
.
 
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
but
few
instances
of
the
wild
lawlessness
and
terrible
anarchy
that
prevailed
in
Britain
,
for
only
the
most
flagrant
cases
of
outrage
were
reported
in
the
newspapers
,
their
columns
being
filled
with
the
latest
intelligence
from
the
seat
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
said
that
over
the
border
the
people
were
more
law
-
abiding
.
<EOS>
The
Scotch
,
too
canny
to
listen
to
the
fiery
declamations
of
hoarse
and
shabby
agitators
,
preferred
to
trust
to
British
pluck
and
the
strong
arm
of
their
brawny
Highlanders
.
<EOS>
In
Caledonia
the
seeds
of
Anarchy
fell
on
stony
ground
.
 
<EOS>
In
Northern
and
Midland
towns
,
however
,
the
excitement
increased
hourly
.
<EOS>
It
extended
everywhere
.
<EOS>
From
Ventnor
to
the
Pentlands
,
from
Holyhead
to
the
Humber
,
from
Scilly
to
the
Nore
,
every
man
and
every
woman
existed
in
fearfulness
of
the
crash
that
was
impending
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
known
throughout
the
breadth
of
our
land
that
the
Government
policy
was
faulty
,
that
War
Office
and
Admiralty
organisation
was
a
rotten
make
-
believe
,
and
,
worst
of
all
,
that
what
critics
had
long
ago
said
as
to
the
inadequacy
of
our
naval
defence
,
even
with
the
ships
built
under
the
programme
of
1894
,
had
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
proved
to
be
true
.
 
<EOS>
The
suspense
was
awful
.
<EOS>
Those
who
were
now
living
in
the
peaceful
atmospheres
of
their
homes
,
surrounded
by
neighbours
and
friends
in
the
centre
of
a
great
town
,
and
feeling
a
sense
of
security
,
might
within
a
few
days
be
shot
down
by
French
rifles
,
or
mowed
down
brutally
by
gleaming
Cossack
_
shushkas
_
.
<EOS>
The
advance
of
the
enemy
was
expected
daily
,
hourly
;
and
the
people
in
the
North
waited
,
staggered
,
breathless
,
and
terrified
.
<EOS>
Men
eagerly
scanned
the
newspapers
;
women
pressed
their
children
to
their
breasts
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
mining
districts
the
shock
had
not
inspired
the
same
amount
of
fear
as
at
the
ports
and
in
the
manufacturing
centres
.
<EOS>
Possibly
it
was
because
work
was
still
proceeding
in
the
pits
,
and
constant
work
prevents
men
from
becoming
restless
,
or
troubling
themselves
about
a
nation
's
woes
.
<EOS>
Toilers
who
worked
below
knew
that
foreign
invaders
had
landed
,
and
that
the
Militia
and
Volunteers
had
been
called
out
,
but
they
vaguely
believed
that
,
the
seat
of
war
being
away
down
south
--
a
very
long
distance
in
the
imagination
of
most
of
them
--
everything
would
be
over
before
they
could
be
called
upon
to
take
part
in
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
coal
and
iron
must
be
got
,
they
argued
,
and
while
they
had
work
they
had
little
time
for
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
great
numbers
of
stalwart
young
miners
enrolled
themselves
in
the
local
Volunteer
corps
,
and
burned
to
avenge
the
affront
to
their
country
and
their
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
Those
were
indeed
fateful
,
ever
-
to
-
be
-
remembered
days
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
this
weary
,
anxious
watching
,
this
constant
dread
of
what
might
next
occur
,
an
item
of
news
was
circulated
which
caused
the
greatest
rejoicing
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Intelligence
reached
New
York
,
by
cable
from
France
,
that
Germany
had
combined
with
England
against
the
Franco
-
Russian
alliance
,
that
her
vast
army
had
been
mobilised
,
and
that
already
the
brave
,
well
-
drilled
legions
of
the
Emperor
William
had
crossed
the
Vosges
,
and
passed
the
frontier
into
France
.
<EOS>
A
sharp
battle
had
been
fought
near
Givet
,
and
that
,
as
well
as
several
other
French
frontier
towns
which
fell
in
1870
,
were
again
in
the
hands
of
the
Germans
.
 
<EOS>
How
different
were
German
methods
to
those
of
the
British
!
 
<EOS>
With
a
perfect
scheme
of
attack
,
every
detail
of
which
had
been
long
thought
out
,
and
which
worked
without
a
hitch
,
the
Kaiser
's
forces
were
awaiting
the
word
of
command
to
march
onward
--
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
For
years
--
ever
since
they
taught
France
that
severe
lesson
in
the
last
disastrous
war
--
it
had
been
the
ambition
of
every
German
cavalryman
to
clink
his
spurs
on
the
asphalte
of
the
Boulevards
.
<EOS>
Now
they
were
actually
on
their
way
towards
their
goal
!
 
<EOS>
The
papers
were
full
of
these
latest
unexpected
developments
,
the
details
of
which
,
necessarily
meagre
owing
to
the
lack
of
direct
communication
,
were
eagerly
discussed
.
<EOS>
It
was
believed
that
Germany
would
,
in
addition
to
defending
her
Polish
frontier
and
attacking
France
,
also
send
a
naval
squadron
from
Kiel
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tsar
's
spy
had
been
foiled
,
and
Russia
and
France
now
knew
they
had
made
a
false
move
!
<EOS>
Russia
's
rapid
and
decisive
movement
was
intended
to
prevent
the
signing
of
the
secret
alliance
,
and
to
bar
England
and
Germany
from
joining
hands
.
<EOS>
But
happily
the
sly
machinations
of
the
Count
von
Beilstein
,
the
released
convict
and
adventurer
,
had
in
a
measure
failed
,
for
Germany
had
considered
it
diplomatic
to
throw
in
her
fortune
with
Great
Britain
in
this
desperate
encounter
.
 
<EOS>
A
feeling
of
thankfulness
spread
through
the
land
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
was
plain
that
if
Germany
intended
to
wield
the
double
-
handled
sword
of
conquest
in
France
,
she
would
have
few
troops
to
spare
to
send
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
those
dark
days
,
full
of
agonising
suspense
,
dragged
on
slowly
.
<EOS>
The
French
well
knew
the
imminent
danger
that
threatened
their
own
country
,
yet
they
could
not
possibly
withdraw
.
<EOS>
Mad
enthusiasts
always
!
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
war
to
the
death
,
they
decided
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
could
not
be
averted
.
<EOS>
So
Britons
unsheathed
their
steel
,
and
held
themselves
in
readiness
for
a
fierce
and
desperate
fray
.
 
<EOS>
The
invasion
had
indeed
been
planned
by
our
enemies
with
marvellous
forethought
and
cunning
.
<EOS>
There
was
treachery
in
the
Intelligence
Department
of
the
British
Admiralty
,
foul
treachery
which
placed
our
country
at
the
mercy
of
the
invader
,
and
sacrificed
thousands
of
lives
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
following
the
sudden
Declaration
of
War
,
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
telegraph
bureau
at
Whitehall
,
whose
duty
it
had
been
to
send
the
telegrams
ordering
the
naval
mobilisation
,
was
found
lying
dead
beside
the
telegraph
instrument
--
stabbed
to
the
heart
!
<EOS>
Inquiries
were
made
,
and
it
was
found
that
one
of
the
clerks
,
a
young
Frenchman
who
had
been
taken
on
temporarily
at
a
low
salary
,
was
missing
.
<EOS>
It
was
further
discovered
that
the
murder
had
been
committed
hours
before
,
immediately
the
Mobilisation
Orders
had
been
sent
;
further
,
that
fictitious
telegrams
had
been
despatched
cancelling
them
,
and
ordering
the
Channel
Fleet
away
to
the
Mediterranean
,
the
Coastguard
Squadron
to
Land
's
End
,
and
the
first
-
class
Reserve
ships
to
proceed
to
the
North
of
Scotland
in
search
of
the
enemy
!
<EOS>
Thus
,
owing
to
these
orders
sent
by
the
murderer
,
England
was
left
unprotected
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
the
truth
was
known
efforts
were
made
to
cancel
the
forged
orders
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Our
Fleets
had
already
sailed
!

CHAPTER
IX
.
 
<EOS>
COUNT
VON
BEILSTEIN
AT
HOME
.
  
<EOS>
Karl
von
Beilstein
sat
in
his
own
comfortable
saddlebag
-
chair
,
in
his
chambers
in
the
Albany
,
lazily
twisting
a
cigarette
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
table
at
his
elbow
was
spread
sheet
319
of
the
Ordnance
Survey
Map
of
England
,
which
embraced
that
part
of
Sussex
where
the
enemy
were
encamped
.
<EOS>
With
red
and
blue
pencils
he
had
been
making
mystic
marks
upon
it
,
and
had
at
last
laid
it
aside
with
a
smile
of
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
She
thought
she
had
me
in
her
power
,
"
he
muttered
ominously
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
The
wolf
!
<EOS>
If
she
knew
everything
,
she
could
make
me
crave
again
at
her
feet
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
Happily
she
is
in
ignorance
;
therefore
that
trip
to
a
more
salubrious
climate
that
I
anticipated
is
for
the
present
postponed
.
<EOS>
I
have
silenced
her
,
and
am
still
master
of
the
situation
--
still
the
agent
of
the
Tsar
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Uttering
a
low
laugh
,
he
gave
his
cigarette
a
final
twist
,
and
then
regarded
it
critically
.
 
<EOS>
The
door
opened
to
admit
his
valet
,
Grevel
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
message
from
the
Embassy
.
<EOS>
The
man
is
waiting
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
His
master
opened
the
note
which
was
handed
to
him
,
read
it
with
contracted
brows
,
and
said--
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
him
that
the
matter
shall
be
arranged
as
quickly
as
possible
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
else
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
leaving
London
,
and
shall
not
be
back
for
a
week
--
perhaps
longer
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
With
a
slight
yawn
he
rose
and
passed
into
his
dressing
-
room
,
while
his
servant
went
to
deliver
his
message
to
the
man
in
waiting
.
<EOS>
The
note
had
produced
a
marked
effect
upon
the
spy
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
order
from
his
taskmasters
in
St.
Petersburg
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
must
be
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
was
of
vital
consequence
in
carrying
out
the
very
delicate
mission
intrusted
to
him
,
a
mission
which
it
would
require
all
his
tact
and
cunning
to
execute
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
emerged
into
his
sitting
-
room
again
,
so
completely
disguised
that
even
his
most
intimate
acquaintances
would
have
failed
to
recognise
him
.
<EOS>
Attired
in
rusty
black
,
with
clean
shaven
face
and
walking
with
a
scholarly
stoop
,
he
had
transformed
himself
from
the
foppish
man
-
about
-
town
to
a
needy
country
parson
,
whose
cheap
boots
were
down
at
heel
,
and
in
the
lappel
of
whose
coat
was
displayed
a
piece
of
worn
and
faded
blue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
Pierre
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
his
man
,
who
entered
at
his
summons
.
<EOS>
"
While
I
am
away
keep
your
eyes
and
ears
open
.
<EOS>
If
there
is
a
shadow
of
suspicion
in
any
quarter
,
burn
all
my
papers
,
send
me
warning
through
the
Embassy
,
and
clear
out
yourself
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Should
matters
assume
a
really
dangerous
aspect
,
you
must
get
down
to
the
Russian
lines
,
where
they
will
pass
you
through
,
and
put
you
on
board
one
of
our
ships
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Has
the
Ministry
at
Petersburg
promised
us
protection
at
last
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
we
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
When
the
game
is
up
among
these
lambs
,
we
shall
calmly
go
over
to
the
other
side
and
witness
the
fun
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
In
what
direction
are
you
now
going
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
,
"
replied
the
spy
,
as
he
unlocked
a
drawer
in
a
small
cabinet
in
a
niche
by
the
fireplace
and
took
from
it
a
long
Circassian
knife
.
<EOS>
Drawing
the
bright
blade
from
its
leathern
sheath
,
he
felt
its
keen
double
edge
with
his
fingers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
like
a
razor
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
desperate
errand
--
eh
?
"
queried
the
valet
,
with
a
grin
,
noticing
how
carefully
the
Count
placed
the
murderous
weapon
in
his
inner
pocket
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Desperate
.
<EOS>
A
word
sometimes
means
death
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
simple
rural
vicar
strode
out
and
down
the
stairs
,
leaving
the
crafty
Pierre
in
wonderment
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
the
latter
exclaimed
in
disgust
,
when
the
receding
footsteps
had
died
away
.
"
<EOS>
So
you
vainly
imagine
,
my
dear
Karl
,
that
you
have
your
heel
upon
my
neck
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
It
is
good
for
me
that
you
do
n't
give
me
credit
for
being
a
little
more
wideawake
,
otherwise
you
would
see
that
you
are
raking
the
chestnuts
from
the
fire
for
me
.
<EOS>
_
Bien
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
I
am
silent
,
docile
,
obedient
;
I
merely
wait
for
you
to
burn
your
fingers
,
then
the
whole
of
the
money
will
be
mine
to
enjoy
,
while
you
will
be
in
the
only
land
where
the
Tsar
does
not
require
secret
agents
.
<EOS>
Vain
,
avaricious
fool
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
You
'll
be
in
your
grave
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
Von
Beilstein
meanwhile
sped
along
down
the
Haymarket
and
Pall
Mall
to
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
The
clock
on
the
stone
tower
of
the
Horse
Guards
showed
it
was
one
o'clock
,
and
,
with
apparently
aimless
purpose
,
he
lounged
about
on
the
broad
pavement
outside
Old
Scotland
Yard
,
immediately
opposite
the
dark
facade
of
the
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
His
hawk
's
eye
carefully
scrutinised
every
single
person
of
the
busy
throng
entering
or
leaving
the
building
.
<EOS>
There
was
great
activity
at
the
naval
headquarters
,
and
the
courtyard
was
crowded
with
persons
hurrying
in
and
out
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
after
a
short
but
vigilant
watch
,
he
turned
quickly
so
as
to
be
unobserved
,
and
moved
slowly
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
cause
of
this
sudden
manoeuvre
was
the
appearance
of
a
well
-
dressed
,
dark
-
bearded
man
of
about
forty
,
having
the
appearance
of
a
naval
officer
in
mufti
,
who
emerged
hastily
from
the
building
with
a
handbag
in
his
hand
,
and
crossed
the
courtyard
to
the
kerb
,
where
he
stood
looking
up
and
down
the
thoroughfare
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
man
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
von
Beilstein
,
under
his
breath
.
"
<EOS>
He
wants
a
cab
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
where
he
's
going
?
"
 
<EOS>
Five
minutes
later
the
naval
officer
was
in
a
hansom
,
driving
towards
Westminster
Bridge
,
while
,
at
a
little
distance
behind
,
the
Tsar
's
agent
was
following
in
another
conveyance
.
<EOS>
Once
on
the
trail
,
the
Count
never
left
his
quarry
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
bridge
,
they
drove
on
rapidly
through
the
crowded
,
turbulent
streets
of
South
London
to
the
Elephant
and
Castle
,
and
thence
down
the
Old
Kent
Road
to
the
New
Cross
Station
of
the
South
-
Eastern
Railway
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
protest
against
the
action
of
the
Government
,
and
in
order
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
establishing
direct
communication
with
London
in
case
of
British
reverses
,
the
lines
from
the
metropolis
to
the
south
had
been
wrecked
by
the
Anarchists
.
<EOS>
On
the
Chatham
and
Dover
Railway
,
Penge
tunnel
had
been
blown
up
,
on
the
Brighton
line
two
bridges
near
Croydon
had
been
similarly
treated
,
and
on
the
South
-
Eastern
four
bridges
in
Rotherhithe
and
Bermondsey
had
been
broken
up
and
rendered
impassable
by
dynamite
,
while
at
Haysden
,
outside
Tunbridge
,
the
rails
had
also
been
torn
up
for
a
considerable
distance
.
<EOS>
Therefore
traffic
to
the
south
from
London
termini
had
been
suspended
,
and
the
few
persons
travelling
were
compelled
to
take
train
at
the
stations
in
the
remoter
southern
suburbs
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
unsuspecting
officer
stepped
into
the
booking
-
office
,
his
attention
was
not
attracted
by
the
quiet
and
seedy
clergyman
who
lounged
near
enough
to
overhear
him
purchase
a
first
-
class
ticket
for
Deal
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
descended
to
the
platform
the
spy
obtained
a
third
-
class
ticket
to
the
same
destination
,
and
leisurely
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Travelling
by
the
same
train
,
they
were
compelled
to
alight
at
Haysden
and
walk
over
the
wrecked
permanent
way
into
Tunbridge
,
from
which
place
they
journeyed
to
Deal
,
arriving
there
about
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Throughout
,
it
was
apparent
to
the
crafty
watcher
that
the
man
he
was
following
was
doing
his
utmost
to
escape
observation
,
and
this
surmise
was
strengthened
by
his
actions
on
arriving
at
the
quaint
old
town
,
now
half
ruined
;
for
,
instead
of
going
to
a
first
-
class
hotel
,
he
walked
on
until
he
came
to
Middle
Street,--a
narrow
little
thoroughfare
,
redolent
of
fish
,
running
parallel
with
the
sea,--and
<EOS>
took
up
quarters
at
the
Mariners
'
Rest
Inn
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
low
,
old
-
fashioned
little
place
,
with
sanded
floors
,
a
smoke
-
blackened
taproom
,
a
rickety
time
-
mellowed
bar
,
with
a
comfortable
little
parlour
beyond
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
latter
room
,
used
in
common
by
the
guests
,
on
the
following
day
the
visitor
from
London
first
met
the
shabby
parson
from
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
The
man
from
the
Admiralty
seemed
in
no
mood
for
conversation
;
nevertheless
,
after
a
preliminary
chat
upon
the
prospect
of
the
invasion
,
they
exchanged
cards
,
and
the
vicar
gradually
became
confidential
.
<EOS>
With
a
pious
air
he
related
how
he
had
been
to
Canterbury
to
conduct
a
revival
mission
which
had
turned
out
marvellously
successful
,
crowds
having
to
be
turned
away
at
every
service
,
and
how
he
was
now
enjoying
a
week
's
vacation
before
returning
to
his
poor
but
extensive
parish
in
Hertfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
this
inn
,
because
I
am
bound
to
practise
a
most
rigid
economy
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
charmed
with
it
.
<EOS>
One
sees
so
much
character
here
in
these
rough
toilers
of
the
sea
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
his
friend
,
whose
card
bore
the
words
"
Commander
Yerbery
,
R.N.
"
<EOS>
"
Being
a
sailor
myself
,
I
prefer
this
homely
little
inn
,
with
its
fisher
folk
as
customers
,
to
a
more
pretentious
and
less
comfortable
establishment
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Are
you
remaining
here
long
?
"
asked
his
clerical
friend
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
--
I
really
do
n't
know
,
"
answered
the
officer
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Possibly
a
day
or
so
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
spy
did
not
pursue
the
subject
further
,
but
conducted
himself
with
an
amiability
which
caused
his
fellow
-
traveller
to
regard
him
as
"
a
real
good
fellow
for
a
parson
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Together
they
smoked
the
long
clays
of
the
hostelry
,
they
sat
in
the
taproom
of
an
evening
and
conversed
with
the
fishermen
who
congregated
there
,
and
frequently
strolled
along
by
the
shore
to
Walmer
,
or
through
the
fields
to
Cottingham
Court
Farm
,
or
Sholden
.
<EOS>
Constantly
,
however
,
Commander
Yerbery
kept
his
eyes
seaward
.
<EOS>
Was
he
apprehensive
lest
Russian
ironclads
should
return
,
and
again
bombard
the
little
town
;
or
was
he
expecting
some
mysterious
signal
from
some
ship
in
the
Downs
?
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
X.
 
<EOS>
A
DEATH
DRAUGHT
.
  
<EOS>
On
several
occasions
the
spy
had
,
with
artful
ingenuity
,
endeavoured
to
discover
the
object
of
Commander
Yerbery
's
sojourn
,
but
upon
that
point
he
preserved
a
silence
that
was
impenetrable
.
<EOS>
In
their
wanderings
about
the
town
they
saw
on
every
side
the
havoc
caused
by
the
bombardment
which
had
taken
place
three
days
previously
.
<EOS>
Whole
rows
of
houses
facing
the
sea
had
been
carried
away
by
the
enemy
's
shells
,
and
the
once
handsome
church
spire
was
now
a
mere
heap
of
smouldering
debris
.
<EOS>
The
barracks
,
which
had
been
one
of
the
objects
of
attack
,
had
suffered
most
severely
.
<EOS>
Melinite
had
been
projected
into
them
,
exploding
with
devastating
effect
,
and
demolishing
the
buildings
,
which
fell
like
packs
of
cards
.
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
the
enemy
had
sailed
away
,
apparently
thinking
the
strategical
position
of
the
place
worthless
.
 
<EOS>
And
all
this
had
been
brought
about
by
this
despicable
villain
--
the
man
who
had
now
wrapped
himself
in
the
cloak
of
sanctity
,
and
who
,
beaming
with
well
-
feigned
good
fellowship
,
walked
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
the
man
upon
whom
he
was
keeping
the
most
vigilant
observation
!
<EOS>
By
night
sleep
scarcely
came
to
his
eyes
,
but
in
his
little
room
,
with
its
clean
old
-
fashioned
dimity
blinds
and
hangings
,
he
lay
awake,--scheming
,
planning
,
plotting
,
preparing
for
the
master
-
stroke
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
,
after
they
had
been
there
three
days
,
he
stood
alone
in
his
bedroom
with
the
door
closed
.
<EOS>
From
his
inner
pocket
he
drew
forth
the
keen
Circassian
blade
that
reposed
there
,
and
gazed
thoughtfully
upon
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
he
muttered
,
suddenly
rousing
himself
,
as
if
a
thought
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
strong
.
<EOS>
He
might
shout
,
and
then
I
should
be
caught
like
a
rat
in
a
trap
.
"
 
<EOS>
Replacing
the
knife
in
his
pocket
,
he
took
from
his
vest
a
tiny
phial
he
always
carried
;
then
,
after
noiselessly
locking
the
door
,
he
took
from
the
same
pocket
a
small
cube
of
lump
sugar
.
<EOS>
Standing
by
the
window
he
uncorked
the
little
bottle
,
and
with
steady
hand
allowed
one
single
drop
of
the
colourless
liquid
to
escape
and
fall
upon
the
sugar
,
which
quickly
absorbed
it
,
leaving
a
small
darkened
stain
.
<EOS>
This
sugar
he
placed
in
a
locked
drawer
to
dry
,
and
,
putting
away
the
phial
,
descended
to
join
his
companion
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
they
were
sitting
together
in
the
private
parlour
behind
the
bar
,
smoking
and
chatting
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
-
fashioned
,
smoke
-
begrimed
room
,
with
low
oak
ceiling
and
high
wainscot,--a
room
in
which
many
a
seafarer
had
found
rest
and
comfort
after
the
toils
and
perils
of
the
deep
,
a
room
in
which
many
a
stirring
tale
of
the
sea
has
been
related
,
and
in
which
one
of
our
best
-
known
nautical
writers
has
gathered
materials
for
his
stirring
ocean
romances
.
 
<EOS>
Although
next
the
bar
,
there
is
no
entrance
on
that
side
,
neither
is
there
any
glass
,
therefore
the
apartment
is
entirely
secluded
from
the
public
portion
of
the
inn
.
<EOS>
At
midnight
the
hearty
Boniface
and
his
wife
and
servant
had
retired
,
and
the
place
was
silent
,
but
the
officer
and
his
fellow
-
guest
still
sat
with
their
pipes
.
<EOS>
The
parson
,
as
became
one
who
exhibited
the
blue
pledge
of
temperance
in
his
coat
,
sipped
his
coffee
,
while
the
other
had
whisky
,
lemon
,
and
a
small
jug
of
hot
water
beside
him
.
<EOS>
The
spy
had
been
using
the
sugar
,
and
the
basin
was
close
to
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
His
companion
presently
made
a
movement
to
reach
it
,
when
the
pleasant
-
spoken
vicar
took
up
the
tongs
quickly
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
Allow
me
to
assist
you
.
<EOS>
One
lump
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
thanks
,
"
replied
the
other
,
holding
his
glass
for
the
small
cube
to
be
thrown
in
.
<EOS>
Then
he
added
the
lemon
,
whisky
,
and
hot
water
.
<EOS>
Beilstein
,
betraying
no
excitement
,
continued
the
conversation
,
calmly
refilled
his
pipe
,
and
watched
his
companion
sip
the
deadly
potion
.
 
<EOS>
Karl
von
Beilstein
had
reduced
poisoning
to
a
fine
art
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
muscle
of
his
face
contracted
,
though
his
keen
eyes
never
left
the
other
's
countenance
.
 
<EOS>
They
talked
on
,
the
Commander
apparently
unaffected
by
the
draught
;
his
friend
smilingly
complacent
and
confident
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
without
warning
,
the
officer
's
face
grew
ashen
pale
and
serious
.
<EOS>
A
violent
tremor
shook
his
stalwart
frame
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
--
I
feel
very
strange
,
"
he
cried
,
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
A
most
curious
sensation
has
come
over
me
--
a
sensation
as
if
--
as
if
--
ah
!
heavens
!
<EOS>
Help
,
help!--I
--
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
breathe
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
mild
-
mannered
parson
jumped
to
his
feet
,
and
stood
before
his
friend
,
watching
the
hideous
contortions
of
his
face
.
 
<EOS>
"
Assistance
!
"
<EOS>
his
victim
gasped
,
sinking
inertly
back
in
the
high
-
backed
Windsor
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fetch
me
a
doctor
--
quick
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
man
addressed
<EOS>
took
no
heed
of
the
appeal
.
<EOS>
He
stood
calmly
by
,
contemplating
with
satisfaction
his
villainous
work
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ca
n't
you
see
--
I'm
ill
?
<EOS>
"
the
dying
man
cried
in
a
feeble
,
piteous
voice
.
<EOS>
"
My
throat
and
head
are
burning
.
<EOS>
Give
me
water--_water
_
!
"
 
<EOS>
Still
the
spy
remained
motionless
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
--
you
refuse
to
assist
me
--
you
scoundrel
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
hoarsely
,
in
dismay
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
it
all
now
!
<EOS>
_
God
!
<EOS>
You
've
poisoned
me
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
With
a
frantic
effort
he
half
-
raised
himself
in
his
chair
,
but
fell
back
in
a
heap
;
his
arms
hanging
helplessly
at
his
side
.
<EOS>
His
breath
came
and
went
in
short
hard
gasps
;
the
death
-
rattle
was
already
in
his
throat
,
and
with
one
long
deep
-
drawn
sigh
the
last
breath
left
the
body
,
and
the
light
gradually
died
out
of
the
agonised
face
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
as
thought
the
Count
unbuttoned
the
dead
man
's
coat
,
and
searching
his
pockets
took
out
a
large
white
official
envelope
bearing
in
the
corner
the
blue
stamp
of
the
Admiralty
.
<EOS>
It
was
addressed
to
"
Sir
Michael
Culme
-
Seymour
,
Admiral
commanding
the
Channel
Squadron
,
"
and
was
marked
"
Private
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
spy
,
as
he
tore
open
the
envelope
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
mistaken
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
He
was
waiting
until
the
flagship
came
into
the
Downs
to
deliver
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
envelope
contained
a
letter
accompanied
by
a
chart
of
the
South
Coast
,
upon
which
were
certain
marks
at
intervals
in
red
with
minute
directions
,
as
well
as
a
copy
of
the
code
of
secret
signals
in
which
some
slight
alterations
had
lately
been
made
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
fortune
!
"
cried
the
Count
gleefully
,
after
reading
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
Their
plans
and
the
secret
of
their
signals
,
too
,
are
now
ours
!
<EOS>
The
Embassy
were
correct
in
their
surmise
.
<EOS>
With
these
the
French
and
Russian
ships
will
be
able
to
act
swiftly
,
and
sweep
the
British
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Now
for
London
as
quickly
as
possible
,
for
the
information
will
be
absolutely
invaluable
.
"
 
<EOS>
Without
a
final
glance
at
the
corpse
,
huddled
up
in
its
chair
,
he
put
on
his
hat
,
and
stealing
noiselessly
from
the
house
,
set
out
in
the
moonlight
to
walk
swiftly
by
way
of
Great
Mongeham
and
Waldershare
to
Shepherd
's
Well
station
,
whence
he
could
get
by
train
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
immense
importance
of
these
secret
documents
he
had
not
overrated
.
<EOS>
Their
possession
would
enable
the
Russian
ships
to
decipher
many
of
the
hitherto
mysterious
British
signals
.
 
<EOS>
The
spy
had
accomplished
his
mission
!

CHAPTER
XI
.
 
<EOS>
THE
MASSACRE
AT
EASTBOURNE
.
  
<EOS>
Hourly
the
most
alarming
reports
were
being
received
at
the
War
Office
,
and
at
newspaper
offices
throughout
the
country
,
of
the
rapidly
-
increasing
forces
of
the
invaders
,
who
were
still
landing
in
enormous
numbers
.
<EOS>
Vague
rumours
were
also
afloat
of
desperate
encounters
at
sea
between
our
Coastguard
Squadron
that
had
returned
and
the
French
and
Russian
ironclads
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
definite
,
however
,
was
known
.
<EOS>
News
travelled
slowly
,
and
was
always
unreliable
.
 
<EOS>
Mobilisation
was
being
hurried
forward
with
all
possible
speed
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
so
sudden
had
been
the
descent
of
the
enemy
,
that
Eastbourne
,
Newhaven
,
and
Seaford
had
already
fallen
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Into
the
half
-
wrecked
town
of
Eastbourne
regiment
after
regiment
of
Russian
infantry
had
been
poured
by
the
transports
_
Samojed
_
and
_
Artelscik
_
,
while
two
regiments
of
dragoons
,
one
of
Cossacks
,
and
many
machine
-
gun
sections
had
also
been
landed
,
in
addition
to
a
quantity
of
French
infantry
from
the
other
vessels
.
<EOS>
The
streets
of
the
usually
clean
,
well
-
ordered
town
were
strewn
with
the
debris
of
fallen
houses
and
shops
that
had
been
wrecked
by
Russian
shells
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
's
Hotel
at
Splash
Point
,
with
its
tiers
of
verandahs
and
central
spire
,
stood
out
a
great
gaunt
blackened
ruin
.
 
<EOS>
Along
Terminus
Road
<EOS>
the
grey
-
coated
hordes
of
the
Great
White
Tsar
looted
the
shops
,
and
showed
no
quarter
to
those
who
fell
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
The
Grand
Hotel
,
the
Burlington
,
the
Cavendish
,
and
others
,
were
quickly
transformed
into
barracks
,
as
well
as
the
half
-
ruined
Town
Hall
,
and
the
Floral
Hall
at
Devonshire
Park
.
 
<EOS>
Robbery
,
outrage
,
and
murder
ran
riot
in
the
town
,
which
only
a
few
days
before
had
been
a
fashionable
health
resort
,
crowded
by
aristocratic
idlers
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
unoffending
persons
had
been
killed
by
the
merciless
fire
from
the
enemy
's
battleships
,
and
hundreds
more
were
being
shot
down
in
the
streets
for
attempting
a
feeble
resistance
.
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
,
surrounded
on
all
sides
by
the
enemy
,
were
powerless
.
 
<EOS>
The
huge
guns
of
the
_
Pamyat
Azova
_
,
the
_
Imperator
Nicolai
I.
_
,
the
_
Pjotr
Velikij
_
,
the
_
Krejser
_
,
the
_
Najezdnik
_
,
and
others
,
had
belched
forth
their
death
-
dealing
missiles
with
an
effect
that
was
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
The
thunder
of
cannon
had
ceased
,
but
was
now
succeeded
by
the
sharp
cracking
of
Russian
rifles
,
as
those
who
,
desperately
guarding
their
homes
and
their
loved
ones
,
and
making
a
stand
against
the
invaders
,
were
shot
down
like
dogs
.
<EOS>
A
crowd
of
townspeople
collected
in
the
open
space
outside
the
railway
station
,
prepared
to
bar
the
advance
of
the
Russians
towards
the
Old
Town
and
Upperton
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
it
was
a
forlorn
hope
for
an
unarmed
mob
to
attempt
any
such
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
A
Russian
officer
suddenly
shouted
a
word
of
command
that
brought
a
company
of
infantry
to
the
halt
,
facing
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Another
word
and
a
hundred
rifles
were
discharged
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
they
flashed
,
and
the
volley
was
repeated
until
the
streets
were
covered
with
dead
and
dying
,
and
the
few
who
were
not
struck
turned
and
fled
,
leaving
the
invaders
to
advance
unopposed
.
 
<EOS>
Horrible
were
the
deeds
committed
that
night
.
<EOS>
English
homes
were
desecrated
,
ruined
,
and
burned
.
<EOS>
Babes
were
murdered
before
the
eyes
of
their
parents
,
many
being
impaled
by
gleaming
Russian
bayonets
;
fathers
were
shot
down
in
the
presence
of
their
wives
and
children
,
and
sons
were
treated
in
a
similar
manner
.

<EOS>
The
massacre
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Ruin
and
desolation
were
on
every
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
of
the
Tsar
,
savage
and
inhuman
,
showed
no
mercy
to
the
weak
and
unprotected
.
<EOS>
They
jeered
and
laughed
at
piteous
appeal
,
and
with
fiendish
brutality
enjoyed
the
destruction
which
everywhere
they
wrought
.
 
<EOS>
Many
a
cold
-
blooded
murder
was
committed
,
many
a
brave
Englishman
fell
beneath
the
heavy
whirling
sabres
of
Circassian
Cossacks
,
the
bayonets
of
French
infantry
,
or
the
deadly
hail
of
machine
guns
.
<EOS>
Battalion
after
battalion
of
the
enemy
,
fierce
and
ruthless
,
clambered
on
over
the
debris
in
Terminus
Road
,
enthusiastic
at
finding
their
feet
upon
English
soil
.
<EOS>
The
flames
of
the
burning
buildings
in
various
parts
of
the
town
illuminated
the
place
with
a
bright
red
glare
that
fell
upon
dark
bearded
faces
,
in
every
line
of
which
was
marked
determination
and
fierce
hostility
.
<EOS>
Landing
near
Langney
Point
,
many
of
the
battalions
entered
the
town
from
the
east
,
destroying
all
the
property
they
came
across
on
their
line
of
advance
,
and
,
turning
into
Terminus
Road
,
then
continued
through
Upperton
and
out
upon
the
road
leading
to
Willingdon
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
forces
,
who
came
ashore
close
to
Holywell
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
,
advanced
direct
over
Warren
Hill
,
and
struck
due
north
towards
Sheep
Lands
.
 
<EOS>
At
about
a
mile
from
the
point
where
the
road
from
Eastdean
crosses
that
to
Jevington
,
the
force
encamped
in
a
most
advantageous
position
upon
Willingdon
Hill
,
while
the
Russians
who
advanced
direct
over
St.
Anthony
's
Hill
,
and
those
who
marched
through
Eastbourne
,
united
at
a
point
on
the
Lewes
Road
near
Park
Farm
,
and
after
occupying
Willingdon
village
,
took
up
a
position
on
the
high
ground
that
lies
between
it
and
Jevington
.
 
<EOS>
From
a
strategic
point
of
view
the
positions
of
both
forces
were
carefully
chosen
.
<EOS>
The
commanding
officers
were
evidently
well
acquainted
with
the
district
,
for
while
the
French
commanded
Eastbourne
and
a
wide
stretch
of
the
Downs
,
the
Russians
also
had
before
them
an
extensive
tract
of
country
extending
in
the
north
to
Polegate
,
in
the
west
to
the
Fore
Down
and
Lillington
,
and
in
the
east
beyond
Willingdon
over
Pevensey
Levels
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
night
powerful
search
-
lights
from
the
French
and
Russian
ships
swept
the
coast
continually
,
illuminating
the
surrounding
hills
and
lending
additional
light
to
the
ruined
and
burning
town
.
<EOS>
Before
the
sun
rose
,
however
,
the
majority
of
the
invading
vessels
had
rounded
Beachy
Head
,
and
had
steamed
away
at
full
speed
down
Channel
.

<EOS>
Daylight
revealed
the
grim
realities
of
war
.
<EOS>
It
showed
Eastbourne
with
its
handsome
buildings
scorched
and
ruined
,
its
streets
blocked
by
fallen
walls
,
and
trees
which
had
once
formed
shady
boulevards
torn
up
and
broken
,
its
shops
looted
,
<EOS>
its
tall
church
steeples
blown
away
,
its
railway
station
wrecked
,
and
its
people
massacred
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
their
life
-
blood
was
wet
upon
the
pavements
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
and
Russian
legions
,
ever
increasing
,
covered
the
hills
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
guns
of
the
French
artillery
and
the
lighter
but
more
deadly
machine
guns
of
the
Russians
had
already
been
placed
in
position
,
and
were
awaiting
the
order
to
move
north
and
commence
the
assault
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
!
<EOS>
Nothing
could
now
be
done
to
improve
the
rotten
state
of
our
defences
.
<EOS>
The
invasion
had
begun
,
and
Britain
,
handicapped
alike
on
land
and
on
sea
,
must
arm
and
fight
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
By
Tuesday
night
,
three
days
after
the
Declaration
of
War
,
two
French
and
half
a
Russian
army
corps
,
amounting
to
90,000
officers
and
men
,
with
10,000
horses
and
1500
guns
and
waggons
,
had
landed
,
in
addition
to
which
reinforcements
constantly
arrived
from
the
French
Channel
and
Russian
Baltic
ports
,
until
the
number
of
the
enemy
on
English
soil
was
estimated
at
over
300,000
.
 
<EOS>
The
overwhelming
descent
on
our
shores
had
been
secretly
planned
by
the
enemy
with
great
forethought
,
every
detail
having
been
most
carefully
arranged
.
<EOS>
The
steam
tonnage
in
the
French
harbours
was
ample
and
to
spare
,
for
many
of
the
vessels
,
being
British
,
had
been
at
once
seized
on
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
interruption
of
the
mail
and
telegraphic
services
between
the
two
countries
left
us
in
total
ignorance
of
the
true
state
of
affairs
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
for
weeks
an
army
of
carpenters
and
engineers
had
been
at
work
preparing
the
necessary
fittings
,
which
were
afterwards
placed
in
position
on
board
the
ships
destined
to
convey
horses
and
men
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
deceive
the
other
Powers
,
a
large
number
of
military
transport
vessels
had
been
fitted
out
at
Brest
for
a
bogus
expedition
to
Dahomey
.
<EOS>
These
ships
actually
put
to
sea
on
the
day
previous
to
the
Declaration
of
War
,
and
on
Saturday
night
,
at
the
hour
when
the
news
reached
Britain
,
they
had
already
embarked
guns
,
horses
,
and
waggons
at
the
Channel
ports
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
the
Tsar
's
manifesto
had
been
issued
the
Russian
Volunteer
Fleet
was
mobilised
,
and
transports
which
had
long
been
held
in
readiness
in
the
Baltic
harbours
embarked
men
and
guns
,
and
,
one
after
another
,
steamed
away
for
England
without
the
slightest
confusion
or
any
undue
haste
.

CHAPTER
XII
.
 
<EOS>
IN
THE
EAGLE
'S
TALONS
.
  
<EOS>
Many
British
military
and
naval
writers
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
a
surprise
invasion
without
any
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
enemy
to
gain
more
than
a
partial
and
temporary
control
of
the
Channel
.
<EOS>
Although
an
attack
on
territory
without
having
previously
command
of
the
sea
had
generally
been
foredoomed
to
failure
,
it
had
been
long
ago
suggested
by
certain
military
officers
in
the
course
of
lectures
at
the
United
Service
Institution
,
that
under
certain
conditions
such
invasion
was
possible
,
and
that
France
might
ere
long
be
ruled
by
some
ambitious
soldier
who
might
be
tempted
to
try
a
sudden
dash
on
_
le
perfide
Albion
_
.
<EOS>
They
pointed
out
that
at
worst
it
would
entail
on
France
the
loss
of
three
or
four
army
corps
,
a
loss
no
greater
than
she
would
suffer
in
one
short
land
campaign
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
at
that
time
very
little
notice
was
taken
of
such
criticisms
and
illustrations
,
for
Britons
had
always
been
prone
to
cast
doubts
upon
the
power
of
other
nations
to
convey
troops
by
sea
,
to
embark
them
,
or
to
land
them
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
many
suggestions
directed
towards
increasing
the
mobility
and
efficiency
of
the
Army
were
,
like
other
warnings
,
cast
aside
,
the
prevailing
opinion
in
the
country
being
that
sudden
invasion
was
an
absolute
impossibility
.
 
<EOS>
Predictions
of
prophets
that
had
so
long
been
scorned
,
derided
,
and
disregarded
by
an
apathetic
British
public
were
rapidly
being
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
Coming
events
had
cast
dark
shadows
that
had
been
unheeded
,
and
now
the
unexpected
bursting
of
the
war
cloud
produced
panic
through
our
land
.
 
<EOS>
General
Sir
Archibald
Alison
struck
an
alarming
note
of
warning
when
he
wrote
in
_
Blackwood
_
in
December
1893
:
"
No
one
can
look
carefully
into
the
present
state
of
Europe
without
feeling
convinced
that
it
can
not
continue
long
in
its
present
condition
.
<EOS>
Every
country
is
maintaining
an
armed
force
out
of
all
proportion
to
its
resources
and
population
,
and
the
consequent
strain
upon
its
monetary
system
and
its
industrial
population
is
ever
increasing
,
and
must
sooner
or
later
become
unbearable
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
had
never
been
sufficiently
impressed
upon
the
British
public
,
that
when
mobilised
for
war
,
and
with
all
the
Reserves
called
out
,
Russia
had
at
her
command
2,722,000
officers
and
men
,
while
France
could
put
2,715,000
into
the
field
,
making
a
total
force
of
the
Franco
-
Russian
Armies
of
5,437,000
men
,
with
9920
field
guns
and
1,480,000
horses
.
 
<EOS>
This
well
-
equipped
force
was
almost
equal
to
the
combined
Armies
of
the
Triple
Alliance
,
Germany
possessing
2,441,000
,
Austria
1,590,000
,
and
Italy
1,909,000
,
a
total
of
5,940,000
officers
and
men
,
with
8184
field
guns
and
813,996
horses
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
these
enormous
totals
,
how
ridiculously
small
appeared
the
British
Army
,
with
its
Regular
forces
at
home
and
abroad
amounting
to
only
211,600
of
all
ranks
,
225,400
Volunteers
,
and
74,000
Reserves
,
or
511,000
fighting
men
!
<EOS>
Of
these
,
only
63,000
Regulars
remained
in
England
and
Wales
,
therefore
our
Reserves
and
Volunteers
were
the
chief
defenders
of
our
homes
.
 
<EOS>
What
a
mere
handful
<EOS>
they
appeared
side
by
side
with
these
huge
European
Armies
!
 
<EOS>
Was
it
not
surprising
that
in
such
circumstances
the
constant
warnings
regarding
the
weakness
of
our
Navy
--
the
force
upon
which
the
very
life
of
our
Empire
depended
--
should
have
been
unheeded
by
the
too
confident
public
?
 
<EOS>
When
we
were
told
plainly
by
a
well
-
known
authority
that
the
number
of
our
war
vessels
was
miserably
inadequate
,
that
we
were
10,000
men
and
1000
officers
short
,
and
,
among
other
things
,
that
a
French
cruiser
had
,
for
all
practical
purposes
,
three
times
the
fighting
efficiency
of
an
English
cruiser
,
no
one
troubled
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
any
one
aroused
from
his
foolishly
apathetic
confidence
in
British
supremacy
at
sea
.
<EOS>
True
,
our
Navy
was
strengthened
to
a
certain
extent
in
1894
,
but
hard
facts
,
solemn
warnings
,
gloomy
forebodings
,
all
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
cast
aside
among
the
"
scares
"
which
crop
up
periodically
in
the
press
during
a
Parliamentary
recess
,
and
which
,
on
the
hearing
of
a
murder
trial
,
or
a
Society
scandal
,
at
once
fizzle
out
and
are
dismissed
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
rude
awakening
to
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
,
Service
men
now
remembered
distinctly
the
prophetic
words
of
the
few
students
of
probable
invasion
.
<EOS>
Once
they
had
regarded
them
as
based
on
wild
improbabilities
,
but
now
they
admitted
that
the
facts
were
as
represented
,
and
that
critics
had
foreseen
catastrophe
.
 
<EOS>
Already
active
steps
had
been
taken
towards
the
defence
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
serious
defects
in
the
mobilisation
scheme
,
the
1st
Army
Corps
,
formed
at
Aldershot
under
Sir
Evelyn
Wood
,
and
three
cavalry
brigades
,
were
now
in
the
field
,
while
the
other
army
corps
were
being
rapidly
conveyed
southwards
.
 
<EOS>
Independently
of
the
Field
Army
,
the
Volunteers
had
mobilised
,
and
were
occupying
the
lines
north
and
south
of
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
This
force
of
Volunteer
infantry
consisted
of
108,300
officers
and
men
,
of
whom
73,000
,
with
212
guns
,
were
placed
on
the
line
south
of
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
It
stretched
along
the
hills
from
Guildford
in
Surrey
to
Halstead
in
Kent
,
with
intermediate
concentration
points
at
Box
Hill
and
Caterham
.
<EOS>
At
the
latter
place
an
efficient
garrison
had
been
established
,
consisting
of
4603
of
all
ranks
of
the
North
London
Brigade
,
4521
of
the
West
London
,
5965
of
the
South
London
,
5439
of
the
Surrey
,
and
6132
of
the
Lancashire
and
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
This
force
was
backed
by
eleven
16-pounder
batteries
of
the
1st
Norfolk
from
Yarmouth
,
the
1st
Sussex
from
Brighton
,
the
1st
Newcastle
and
the
2nd
Durham
from
Seaham
,
and
ten
40-pounder
batteries
of
the
3rd
and
6th
Lancashire
from
Liverpool
,
the
9th
Lancashire
from
Bolton
,
the
1st
Cheshire
from
Chester
,
the
1st
Cinque
Ports
from
Dover
,
and
the
2nd
Cinque
Ports
from
St.
Leonards
.
<EOS>
At
Halstead
,
on
the
left
flank
,
there
were
massed
about
20,470
Volunteer
infantry
,
these
being
made
up
of
the
South
Wales
Brigade
4182
,
Welsh
Border
5192
,
the
North
Midland
5225
,
and
the
South
Midland
5970
.
<EOS>
The
eleven
16-pounder
batteries
came
from
the
Woolwich
Arsenal
,
Monmouth
,
Shropshire
,
and
Stafford
Corps
,
and
five
40-pounder
batteries
from
the
Preston
Corps
.
 
<EOS>
To
Guildford
4471
infantry
in
the
Home
Counties
Brigade
and
4097
in
the
Western
Counties
were
assigned
,
while
the
guns
consisted
of
four
40-pounder
batteries
from
the
York
and
Leeds
Corps
,
the
16-pounder
batteries
of
the
Fife
,
Highland
,
and
Midlothian
Corps
being
unable
,
as
yet
,
to
get
south
on
account
of
the
congested
state
of
all
the
northern
railways
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
same
reason
,
too
,
the
force
at
Box
Hill
,
the
remaining
post
in
the
south
line
of
defence
,
was
a
very
weak
one
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
Volunteers
assigned
were
mostly
Scottish
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
Glasgow
Brigade
8000
of
all
ranks
arrived
,
with
4000
from
the
South
of
Scotland
Brigade
;
but
the
Highland
Brigade
of
4400
men
,
all
enthusiastically
patriotic
,
and
the
16-pounder
batteries
from
Ayr
and
Lanark
,
were
compelled
,
to
their
chagrin
,
to
wait
at
their
headquarters
for
several
days
before
the
railways
--
every
resource
of
which
was
strained
to
their
utmost
limits
--
could
move
them
forward
to
the
seat
of
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
five
heavy
batteries
of
the
Aberdeen
and
North
York
Corps
succeeded
in
getting
down
to
their
place
of
concentration
early
,
as
likewise
did
the
16-pounder
battery
from
Galloway
.
<EOS>
Volunteers
also
undertook
the
defences
north
of
the
metropolis
,
and
a
strong
line
,
consisting
of
a
number
of
provincial
brigades
,
stretched
from
Tilbury
to
Brentwood
and
Epping
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
Volunteer
holds
no
romantic
notions
of
"
death
or
glory
,
"
but
is
none
the
less
prepared
to
do
his
duty
,
and
is
always
ready
"
to
do
anything
,
and
to
go
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Every
officer
and
every
man
of
this
great
force
which
had
mounted
guard
north
and
south
of
the
Thames
was
resolved
to
act
his
part
bravely
,
and
,
if
necessary
,
lay
down
his
life
for
his
country
's
honour
.
 
<EOS>
At
their
posts
on
the
Surrey
Hills
,
ready
at
any
moment
to
go
into
action
,
and
firmly
determined
that
no
invader
should
enter
the
vast
Capital
of
the
World
,
they
impatiently
awaited
the
development
of
the
situation
,
eager
to
face
and
annihilate
their
foreign
foe
.
 
<EOS>
Britannia
had
always
been
justly
proud
of
her
Volunteer
forces
,
although
their
actual
strength
in
time
of
invasion
had
never
before
been
demonstrated
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
the
test
which
had
been
applied
showed
that
,
with
an
exception
of
rarest
occurrence
,
every
man
had
responded
to
this
hasty
call
to
arms
,
and
that
on
active
service
they
were
as
fearless
and
courageous
as
any
body
of
Regulars
ever
put
in
the
field
.

Every

was
alive

danger

CHAPTER
XIII
.
 
<EOS>
FIERCE
FIGHTING
IN
THE
CHANNEL
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
Channel
disastrous
events
of
a
most
exciting
character
were
now
rapidly
occurring
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
Seaford
Bay
,
Pevensey
Bay
,
and
off
Brighton
and
the
Mares
at
Cuckmere
Haven
,
the
enemy
's
transports
,
having
landed
troops
and
stores
,
rode
at
anchor
,
forming
a
line
of
retreat
in
case
of
reverses
,
while
many
fast
French
cruisers
steamed
up
and
down
,
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
any
British
merchant
or
mail
steamers
which
,
ignorant
of
the
hostilities
,
entered
the
Channel
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
and
crews
of
these
steamers
were
in
most
cases
so
utterly
surprised
that
they
fell
an
easy
prey
to
the
marauding
vessels
,
many
being
captured
and
taken
to
French
ports
without
a
shot
being
fired
.
<EOS>
Other
vessels
,
on
endeavouring
to
escape
,
were
either
overhauled
or
sunk
by
the
heavy
fire
of
pursuing
cruisers
.
<EOS>
One
instance
was
that
of
the
fast
mail
steamer
_
Carpathian
_
,
belonging
to
the
Union
Steamship
Company
,
which
,
entering
the
Channel
on
a
voyage
from
Cape
Town
to
Southampton
,
was
attacked
off
the
Eddystone
by
the
Russian
armoured
cruiser
_
Gerzog
Edinburskij
_
.
<EOS>
The
panic
on
board
was
indescribable
,
over
a
hundred
steerage
passengers
being
killed
or
mutilated
by
the
shells
from
the
bow
guns
of
the
cruiser
,
and
the
captain
himself
being
blown
to
atoms
by
an
explosion
which
occurred
when
a
shot
struck
and
carried
away
the
forward
funnel
.
<EOS>
After
an
exciting
chase
,
the
_
Carpathian
_
was
sunk
near
Start
Point
,
and
of
the
five
hundred
passengers
and
crew
scarcely
<EOS>
a
single
person
survived
.
 
<EOS>
This
terrible
work
of
destruction
accomplished
,
the
Russian
cruiser
turned
westward
again
to
await
further
prey
.
<EOS>
As
she
steamed
away
,
however
,
another
ship
rounded
the
Start
following
at
full
speed
in
her
wake
.
<EOS>
This
vessel
,
which
was
flying
the
British
flag
,
was
the
barbette
-
ship
_
Centurion
_
.
<EOS>
Already
her
captain
had
witnessed
the
attack
and
sinking
of
the
_
Carpathian
_
,
but
from
a
distance
too
great
to
enable
him
to
assist
the
defenceless
liner
,
and
he
was
now
on
his
way
to
attack
the
Tsar
's
cruiser
.
<EOS>
Almost
immediately
she
was
noticed
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
later
she
drew
within
range
,
and
soon
the
two
ships
were
engaged
in
a
most
desperate
encounter
.
<EOS>
The
gunners
on
the
_
Centurion
_
,
seeing
the
Russian
cross
flying
defiantly
,
and
knowing
the
frightful
havoc
already
wrought
on
land
by
the
enemy
,
worked
with
that
pluck
and
indomitable
energy
characteristic
of
the
Britisher
.
<EOS>
Shot
after
shot
was
exchanged
,
but
hissed
and
splashed
without
effect
until
the
ships
drew
nearer
,
and
then
nearly
every
shell
struck
home
.
<EOS>
The
rush
of
flame
from
the
quick
-
firing
guns
of
the
_
Centurion
_
was
continuous
,
and
the
firing
was
much
more
accurate
than
that
of
her
opponent
,
nevertheless
the
latter
was
manipulated
with
remarkable
skill
.
 
<EOS>
The
roar
of
the
guns
was
deafening
.
<EOS>
Clouds
of
smoke
rose
so
thickly
that
the
vessels
could
scarcely
distinguish
each
other
.
<EOS>
But
the
firing
was
almost
continuous
,
until
suddenly
a
shell
struck
the
_
Centurion
_
abaft
the
funnel
,
and
for
a
moment
stilled
her
guns
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
for
long
,
for
in
a
few
moments
she
recovered
from
the
shock
,
and
her
guns
were
again
sending
forth
shells
with
regularity
and
precision
.
<EOS>
Again
a
shell
struck
the
_
Centurion
_
,
this
time
carrying
away
one
of
her
funnels
and
killing
a
large
number
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
captain
,
still
as
cool
as
if
standing
on
the
hearthrug
of
the
smoking
-
room
of
the
United
Service
Club
,
took
his
vessel
closer
,
continuing
the
fire
,
heedless
of
the
fact
that
the
Russian
shells
striking
his
ship
were
playing
such
fearful
havoc
with
it
.
<EOS>
Every
preparation
had
been
made
for
a
desperate
fight
to
the
death
,
when
suddenly
a
shot
struck
the
vessel
,
causing
her
to
reel
and
shiver
.
 
<EOS>
So
well
had
the
Russians
directed
their
fire
that
the
British
vessel
could
not
reply
.
<EOS>
One
of
her
29-tonners
had
been
blown
completely
off
its
carriage
,
and
lay
shattered
with
men
dead
all
around
,
while
two
of
her
quick
-
firing
broadside
guns
had
been
rendered
useless
,
and
she
had
sustained
other
injuries
of
a
very
serious
character
,
besides
losing
nearly
half
her
men
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
silent
,
riding
to
the
swell
,
when
wild
exultant
shouts
in
Russian
went
up
from
the
enemy
's
ship
,
mingling
with
the
heavy
fire
they
still
kept
up
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
however
,
even
while
the
victorious
shouts
resounded
,
the
captain
of
the
_
Centurion
_
,
still
cool
and
collected
,
swung
round
his
vessel
,
and
turning
,
touched
one
of
the
electric
knobs
at
his
hand
.
<EOS>
As
he
did
so
a
long
silvery
object
shot
noiselessly
from
the
side
of
the
ship
,
and
plunged
with
a
splash
into
the
rising
waves
.
 
<EOS>
Seconds
seemed
hours
.
<EOS>
For
a
whole
three
minutes
the
captain
waited
;
then
,
disappointed
,
he
turned
away
with
an
expression
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
The
torpedo
had
missed
its
mark
,
and
every
moment
lost
might
determine
their
fate
.
<EOS>
With
guns
still
silent
he
again
adroitly
manoeuvred
his
ship
.
<EOS>
Once
again
he
touched
the
electric
knob
,
and
again
a
torpedo
,
released
from
its
tube
,
sped
rapidly
through
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
dull
and
muffled
explosion
from
the
Russian
cruiser
sounded
.
<EOS>
Above
the
dense
smoke
a
flame
shot
high
,
with
great
columns
of
spray
,
as
the
guns
suddenly
ceased
their
thunder
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
dead
stillness
,
broken
only
by
the
wash
of
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
smoke
clearing
showed
the
debris
of
the
_
Gerzog
Edinburskij
_
fast
sinking
beneath
the
restless
waters
.
<EOS>
Some
splinters
precipitated
into
the
air
had
fallen
with
loud
splashes
in
every
direction
,
and
amid
the
victorious
shouts
of
the
British
bluejackets
the
disabled
ship
,
with
its
fluttering
Russian
cross
,
slowly
disappeared
for
ever
,
carrying
down
every
soul
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
The
torpedo
,
striking
her
amidships
,
had
blown
an
enormous
hole
right
through
her
double
bottom
,
and
torn
her
transverse
bulkheads
away
so
much
that
her
watertight
doors
were
useless
for
keeping
her
afloat
,
even
for
a
few
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Partially
crippled
as
she
was
,
the
_
Centurion
_
steamed
slowly
westward
,
until
at
noon
on
the
following
day
she
fell
in
with
a
division
of
the
Coastguard
Squadron
,
which
,
acting
under
the
fictitious
telegraphic
orders
of
the
French
spy
,
had
been
to
Land
's
End
,
but
which
,
now
the
enemy
had
landed
,
<EOS>
had
received
genuine
orders
from
the
Admiralty
.
 
<EOS>
Compared
with
the
number
and
strength
of
the
French
and
Russian
vessels
mustered
in
the
Channel
,
this
force
was
so
small
as
to
appear
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
To
send
this
weak
defending
division
against
the
mighty
power
of
the
invaders
was
sheer
madness
,
and
everybody
on
board
knew
it
.
<EOS>
The
vessels
were
weaker
in
every
detail
than
those
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
At
full
speed
the
British
vessels
steamed
on
throughout
that
day
,
until
at
8
P.M.
,
when
about
twenty
miles
south
of
Selsey
Bill
,
they
were
joined
by
forces
from
the
Solent
.
<EOS>
These
consisted
of
the
turret
-
ship
_
Monarch
_
,
the
turret
-
ram
_
Rupert
_
,
the
barbette
-
ship
_
Rodney
_
,
the
belted
cruiser
_
Aurora
_
,
and
the
coast
defence
armour
-
clads
_
Cyclops
_
and
_
Gorgon
_
,
together
with
a
number
of
torpedo
boats
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
calm
,
but
moonless
,
and
without
delay
the
vessels
all
continued
the
voyage
up
Channel
silently
,
with
lights
extinguished
.
 
<EOS>
Two
hours
later
the
officers
noticed
that
away
on
the
horizon
a
light
suddenly
flashed
twice
and
then
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
enemy
's
ships
had
signalled
the
approach
of
the
defenders
!
 
<EOS>
This
caused
the
British
Admiral
to
alter
his
course
slightly
,
and
the
vessels
steamed
along
in
the
direction
the
light
had
shown
.
 
<EOS>
In
turrets
and
in
broadside
batteries
there
was
a
deep
hush
of
expectation
.
<EOS>
Officers
and
men
standing
at
their
quarters
scarcely
spoke
.
<EOS>
All
felt
the
fight
must
be
most
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
in
the
far
distance
a
small
patch
of
light
in
the
sky
showed
the
direction
of
Brighton
,
and
almost
immediately
the
Admiral
signalled
to
the
cruisers
<EOS>
_
Aurora
_
,
_
Galatea
_
,
and
_
Narcissus
_
,
and
the
new
battleship
_
Hannibal
_
,
built
under
the
1894
programme
,
to
detach
themselves
with
six
torpedo
boats
,
and
take
an
easterly
course
,
in
order
to
carry
out
instructions
which
he
gave
.
<EOS>
These
tactics
caused
considerable
comment
.
 
<EOS>
The
orders
were
to
make
straight
for
Eastbourne
,
and
to
suddenly
attack
and
destroy
any
of
the
hostile
transports
that
were
lying
there
,
<EOS>
the
object
being
twofold
--
firstly
,
to
cut
off
the
enemy
's
line
of
retreat
,
and
secondly
,
to
prevent
the
vessels
from
being
used
for
the
purpose
of
landing
further
reinforcements
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
2
A.M.
this
gallant
little
division
had
,
by
careful
manoeuvring
,
and
assisted
by
a
slight
mist
which
now
hung
over
the
sea
,
rounded
Beachy
Head
without
being
discovered
,
and
had
got
outside
Pevensey
Bay
about
eight
miles
from
land
.
<EOS>
Here
a
number
of
Russian
transports
and
service
steamers
were
lying
,
among
them
being
the
_
Samojed
_
and
_
Olaf
_
,
_
Krasnaya
Gorka
_
and
_
Vladimir
_
,
with
two
smaller
ones
--
the
_
Dnepr
_
and
the
_
<EOS>
Artelscik
_
.
 
<EOS>
Silently
,
and
without
showing
any
lights
,
a
British
torpedo
boat
sped
quickly
along
to
where
the
dark
outline
of
a
ship
loomed
through
the
mist
,
and
,
having
ascertained
that
it
was
the
_
Olaf
_
,
drew
up
quickly
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
elapsed
,
all
being
quiet
.
<EOS>
Then
suddenly
a
bright
flash
was
followed
by
a
fearful
explosion
,
and
the
bottom
of
the
Tsar
's
vessel
being
completely
ripped
up
by
the
torpedo
,
she
commenced
to
settle
down
immediately
,
before
any
of
those
on
board
could
save
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
scarcely
recovered
from
their
surprise
and
confusion
when
three
other
loud
explosions
occurred
,
and
in
each
case
transport
vessels
were
blown
up
.
<EOS>
British
torpedo
boats
,
darting
hither
and
thither
between
the
Russian
ships
,
were
dealing
terrible
blows
from
which
no
vessel
could
recover
.
<EOS>
So
active
were
they
,
indeed
,
that
within
the
space
of
fifteen
minutes
six
transports
had
been
blown
up
,
as
well
as
the
first
-
class
torpedo
boat
_
Abo
_
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
life
was
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
Simultaneously
with
the
first
explosion
,
the
guns
of
the
_
Aurora
_
,
_
Galatea
_
,
and
_
Narcissus
_
thundered
out
a
terrible
salute
.
<EOS>
The
bright
search
-
lights
of
the
Russian
cruisers
and
of
the
battleship
_
Navarin
_
immediately
swept
the
sea
,
and
through
the
mist
discerned
the
British
ships
.
<EOS>
The
lights
served
only
to
show
the
latter
the
exact
position
of
the
enemy
,
and
again
our
guns
belched
forth
shot
and
shell
with
disastrous
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Quickly
,
however
,
the
Russian
vessels
replied
.
<EOS>
Flame
flashed
continuously
from
the
turret
of
the
_
Navarin
_
and
the
port
guns
of
the
_
Opricnik
_
and
the
_
Najezdnik
_
,
while
the
search
-
lights
were
at
the
same
time
shut
off
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
fire
was
very
ineffectual
,
but
gradually
as
the
vessels
crept
closer
to
each
other
<EOS>
the
encounter
became
more
and
more
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
The
Russian
torpedo
boats
_
Vzryv
_
,
_
Vindava
_
,
and
_
Kotlinj
_
were
immediately
active
,
and
the
_
Narcissus
_
had
a
very
narrow
escape
,
a
Whitehead
torpedo
passing
right
under
her
bows
,
while
one
British
torpedo
boat
,
which
at
the
same
moment
was
endeavouring
to
launch
its
deadly
projectile
at
the
_
Navarin
_
,
was
sent
to
the
bottom
by
a
single
shot
from
the
_
Najezdnik
_
.
 
<EOS>
The
combat
was
desperate
and
terrible
.
<EOS>
That
the
British
had
been
already
successful
in
surprising
and
sinking
a
torpedo
boat
and
six
of
the
hostile
transports
was
true
;
nevertheless
the
number
of
Russian
ships
lying
there
was
much
greater
than
the
British
Admiral
had
anticipated
,
and
,
to
say
the
least
,
the
four
vessels
now
found
themselves
in
a
most
critical
position
.
 
<EOS>
The
_
Navarin
_
alone
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
Tsar
's
battleships
,
and
,
in
addition
to
the
seven
cruisers
and
nine
torpedo
boats
,
comprised
an
overwhelming
force
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
English
warships
held
their
own
,
pouring
forth
an
incessant
fire
.
<EOS>
Each
gun
's
crew
knew
they
were
face
to
face
with
death
,
but
,
inspired
by
the
coolness
of
their
officers
,
they
worked
on
calmly
and
indefatigably
.
<EOS>
Many
of
their
shots
went
home
with
frightful
effect
.
<EOS>
One
shell
which
burst
over
the
magazine
of
the
_
Lieut
.
<EOS>
Iljin
_
ripped
up
her
deck
and
caused
severe
loss
of
life
,
while
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
one
of
the
heavy
turret
guns
of
the
_
Navarin
_
had
been
disabled
,
and
two
more
Russian
torpedo
boats
sunk
.
<EOS>
Our
torpedo
boat
destroyers
operating
on
the
Channel
seaboard
were
performing
excellent
work
,
the
_
Havock
_
,
_
Shark
_
,
_
Hornet
_
,
_
Dart
_
,
_

_
Teaser

_
Janus
_
,
_
<EOS>
Surly
_
,
and
_
Porcupine
_
all
being
manoeuvred
with
splendid
success
.
<EOS>
Several
,
however
,
were
lost
while
sweeping
out
the
enemy
's
torpedo
boat
shelters
,
including
the
_
Ardent
_
,
_
Charger
_
,
_

]
 
<EOS>
But
the
British
vessels
were
now
suffering
terribly
,
hemmed
in
as
they
were
by
the
enemy
,
with
shells
falling
upon
them
every
moment
,
and
their
decks
swept
by
the
withering
fire
of
machine
guns
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
after
a
shell
had
burst
in
the
stern
of
the
_
Aurora
_
,
she
ceased
firing
and
swung
round
,
almost
colliding
with
the
_
Narcissus
_
.
<EOS>
Her
steam
steering
-
gear
had
,
alas
!
<EOS>
been
broken
by
the
shot
,
and
for
a
few
moments
her
officers
lost
control
over
her
.
 
<EOS>
A
Russian
torpedo
boat
in
shelter
behind
the
_
Navarin
_
,
now
seeing
its
chance
,
darted
out
and
launched
its
projectile
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
of
the
_
Aurora
_
,
aware
of
their
danger
,
seemed
utterly
powerless
to
avert
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
terrible
moment
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
later
the
torpedo
struck
,
the
cruiser
rose
as
if
she
had
ridden
over
a
volcano
,
and
then
,
as
she
gradually
settled
down
,
the
dark
sea
rolled
over
as
gallant
a
crew
as
ever
sailed
beneath
the
White
Ensign
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
the
_
Navarin
_
exchanged
rapid
signals
with
a
number
of
ships
which
were
approaching
with
all
speed
from
the
direction
of
Hastings
,
and
the
captains
of
the
three
remaining
British
vessels
saw
that
they
had
fallen
into
a
trap
.
 
<EOS>
The
_
Narcissus
_
had
been
drawn
between
two
fires
.
<EOS>
Both
her
funnels
had
been
shot
away
,
two
of
her
broadside
guns
were
useless
,
and
she
had
sustained
damage
to
her
engines
;
nevertheless
,
her
captain
,
with
the
dogged
perseverance
of
a
British
sailor
,
continued
the
desperate
combat
.
<EOS>
With
the
first
flush
of
dawn
the
fog
had
lifted
,
but
there
was
scarcely
sufficient
wind
to
spread
out
the
British
ensign
,
which
still
waved
with
lazy
defiance
.
 
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
her
was
the
ponderous
_
Navarin
_
,
from
the
turret
of
which
shells
were
projected
with
monotonous
regularity
,
while
on
the
other
the
British
cruiser
was
attacked
vigorously
by
the
_
Najezdnik
_
.
<EOS>
The
_
Narcissus
_
,
however
,
quickly
showed
the
Russians
what
she
could
do
against
such
overwhelming
odds
,
for
presently
she
sent
a
shot
from
one
of
her
20-ton
guns
right
under
the
turret
of
the
_
Navarin
_
,
causing
a
most
disastrous
explosion
on
board
that
vessel
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
her
6-inch
breechloaders
pounded
away
at
her
second
antagonist
,
and
sank
a
torpedo
boat
manoeuvring
near
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
_
Galatea
_
and
the
_
Hannibal
_
were
in
an
equally
serious
predicament
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
torpedo
boats
swarmed
around
them
,
while
the
cruisers
_
Opricnik
_
,
_
Admiral
Korniloff
_
,
_
Rynda
_
,
and
several
other
vessels
,
kept
up
a
hot
,
incessant
fire
,
which
was
returned
energetically
by
the
British
vessels
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
was
magnificent
,
appalling
!
<EOS>
In
the
spreading
dawn
,
the
great
ships
manoeuvring
smartly
,
each
strove
to
obtain
points
of
vantage
,
and
vied
with
each
other
in
their
awful
work
of
destruction
.
<EOS>
The
activity
of
the
British
torpedo
boats
,
darting
here
and
there
,
showed
that
those
who
manned
them
were
utterly
reckless
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
As
they
sped
about
,
it
was
indeed
marvellous
how
they
escaped
destruction
,
for
the
Russians
had
more
than
double
the
number
of
boats
,
and
their
speed
was
quite
equal
to
our
own
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
British
boats
followed
up
their
successes
by
other
brilliant
deeds
of
daring
,
for
one
of
them
,
with
a
sudden
dash
,
took
the
_
Rynda
_
off
her
guard
,
and
sent
a
torpedo
at
her
with
awful
result
,
while
a
few
moments
later
two
terrific
explosions
sounded
almost
simultaneously
above
the
thunder
of
the
guns
,
and
it
was
then
seen
that
the
unprotected
cruiser
_
Asia
_
,
and
the
last
remaining
transport
the
_
Krasnaya
Gorka
_
,
were
both
sinking
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
ghastly
spectacle
.
 
<EOS>
Hoarse
despairing
shrieks
went
up
from
hundreds
of
Russian
sailors
who
fought
and
struggled
for
life
in
the
dark
rolling
waters
,
and
three
British
torpedo
boats
humanely
rescued
a
great
number
of
them
.
<EOS>
Many
,
however
,
sank
immediately
with
their
vessels
,
while
some
strong
swimmers
struck
out
for
the
distant
shore
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
without
exception
,
all
these
succumbed
to
exhaustion
ere
they
could
reach
the
land
,
and
the
long
waves
closed
over
them
as
they
threw
up
their
arms
and
sank
into
the
deep
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
first
few
minutes
following
this
sudden
disaster
to
the
enemy
the
firing
ceased
,
and
the
_
Navarin
_
ran
up
signals
.
<EOS>
This
action
attracted
the
attention
of
the
officers
of
the
British
vessels
to
the
approaching
ships
,
and
to
their
amazement
and
dismay
they
discovered
that
they
were
a
squadron
of
the
enemy
who
had
returned
unexpectedly
from
the
direction
of
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
ships
,
in
their
half
-
crippled
condition
,
could
not
possibly
withstand
such
an
onslaught
as
they
knew
was
about
to
be
made
upon
them
,
for
the
enemy
's
reinforcements
consisted
of
the
steel
barbette
-
ships
_
Gangut
_
,
_
Alexander
II
.
<EOS>
_
,
and
_
Nicolai
I.
_
,
of
the
Baltic
Fleet
,
the
great
turret
-
ship
_
Petr
Veliky
_
,
the
_
Rurik
_
,
a
very
powerful
central
-
battery
belted
cruiser
of
over
ten
thousand
tons
,
two
new
cruisers
of
the
same
type
that
had
been
recently
completed
,
the
_
Enara
_
and
_
Ischma
_
,
with
three
other
cruisers
and
a
large
flotilla
of
torpedo
boats
.
<EOS>
Accompanying
them
were
the
French
10,000-ton
armoured
barbette
-
ship
_
Magenta
_
,
the
central
-
battery
ship
_
Richelieu
_
,
the
armoured
turret
-
ship
_
Tonnerre
_
,
and
the
_
Hoche
_
,
one
of
the
finest
vessels
of
our
Gallic
neighbour
's
Navy
,
as
well
as
the
torpedo
cruisers
_
Hirondelle
_
and
_
Fleurus
_
,
and
a
number
of
swift
torpedo
boats
and
"
catchers
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
captains
of
the
British
vessels
saw
that
in
the
face
of
such
a
force
defeat
was
a
foregone
conclusion
;
therefore
they
could
do
nothing
but
retreat
hastily
towards
Newhaven
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
the
division
of
the
British
Coastguard
Squadron
which
had
gone
there
for
the
same
purpose
as
they
had
rounded
Beachy
Head
,
namely
,
to
destroy
the
enemy
's
transports
.
 
<EOS>
Without
delay
the
three
vessels
swung
round
with
all
speed
and
were
quickly
headed
down
Channel
,
while
the
remaining
attendant
torpedo
boats
,
noticing
this
sudden
retreat
,
also
darted
away
.
<EOS>
This
manoeuvre
did
not
,
of
course
,
proceed
unchecked
,
the
enemy
being
determined
they
should
not
escape
.
<EOS>
Signals
were
immediately
made
by
the
_
Alexander
II
.
<EOS>
_
,
the
flagship
,
and
the
_
Petr
Veliky
_
and
_
Enara
_
,
being
within
range
,
blazed
forth
a
storm
of
shell
upon
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
The
shots
,
however
,
fell
wide
,
and
ricochetted
over
the
water
,
sending
up
huge
columns
of
spray
;
whereupon
the
_
Narcissus
_
and
_
Galatea
_
replied
steadily
with
their
6-inch
guns
,
while
the
heavy
guns
of
the
_
Hannibal
_
were
also
quickly
brought
into
play
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
_
Magenta
_
and
_
Tonnerre
_
with
the
_
Alger
_
,
_
Cecille
_
,
and
_
Sfax
_
,
started
in
pursuit
,
and
an
intensely
exciting
chase
commenced
.
<EOS>
The
engines
of
the
British
vessels
were
run
at
the
highest
possible
pressure
,
but
the
French
ships
proved
several
knots
swifter
.
<EOS>
As
they
steamed
at
full
speed
around
Beachy
Head
towards
Seaford
Bay
<EOS>
the
enemy
gradually
overhauled
them
.
<EOS>
The
brisk
fire
which
was
being
kept
up
soon
began
to
tell
,
for
all
three
retreating
ships
had
lost
many
men
,
and
the
scenes
of
bloodshed
on
board
were
frightful
.
 
<EOS>
Eagerly
the
officers
swept
the
horizon
with
their
glasses
to
discover
signs
of
friendly
aid
,
but
none
hove
in
sight
.
<EOS>
All
three
ships
were
weak
,
their
guns
disabled
,
with
whole
guns
'
crews
lying
dead
around
,
and
many
of
the
officers
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
In
strength
,
in
speed
,
in
armaments
--
in
fact
,
in
everything
--
they
were
inferior
to
their
opponents
,
and
they
saw
it
was
a
question
of
sheer
force
,
not
one
of
courage
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
either
be
compelled
to
surrender
to
the
Tricolor
,
or
deliberately
seek
the
grave
.
<EOS>
With
such
a
force
bearing
down
upon
them
,
escape
seemed
absolutely
impossible
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
 
<EOS>
BATTLE
OFF
BEACHY
HEAD
.
  
<EOS>
The
sun
at
last
broke
forth
brilliantly
,
betokoning
another
blazing
day
.
 
<EOS>
Having
regard
to
the
fact
that
both
the
Channel
Fleet
and
the
reserve
had
been
sent
on
futile
errands
by
our
enemy
's
secret
agent
,
and
the
superior
forces
against
which
the
British
had
all
along
had
to
fight
,
they
had
most
assuredly
shown
what
tact
and
courage
could
effect
.
 
<EOS>
Opposite
<EOS>
the
Belle
Tout
lighthouse
a
disaster
occurred
to
the
_
Narcissus
_
.
<EOS>
During
the
fight
one
of
her
engines
had
been
injured
,
and
this
being
now
strained
to
its
utmost
limit
had
suddenly
broken
down
altogether
,
with
the
result
that
the
vessel
gradually
slackened
speed
,
and
the
_
Sfax
_
and
_
Alger
_
bore
down
quickly
upon
her
,
pouring
into
her
a
heavy
fire
from
their
5-tonners
.
<EOS>
The
reply
was
a
weak
one
from
her
quick
-
firing
guns
,
her
heavy
arms
having
nearly
all
been
disabled
.
 
<EOS>
Onward
steamed
the
_
Galatea
_
and
_
Hannibal
_
,
keeping
up
a
running
fire
with
the
four
vessels
pursuing
them
,
while
the
two
cruisers
engaging
the
_
Narcissus
_
<EOS>
continued
their
strenuous
endeavours
to
silence
her
guns
.
<EOS>
The
British
sailors
,
however
,
still
undaunted
,
quickly
showed
their
opponents
that
all
the
arms
workable
would
be
brought
into
play
by
directing
a
most
vigorous
fire
upon
their
pursuers
,
blowing
away
one
of
the
funnels
of
the
_
Alger
_
,
and
disabling
one
of
her
large
bow
guns
.
 
<EOS>
Just
then
,
however
,
while
the
_
Narcissus
_
was
discharging
a
broadside
,
a
torpedo
boat
crept
under
her
stern
and
sent
forth
its
submerged
projectile
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
there
was
a
hush
of
expectation
,
then
a
dull
explosion
sounded
as
the
cruiser
,
apparently
rent
in
twain
,
plunged
stern
foremost
into
the
sea
,
and
with
her
ensign
still
flying
gradually
disappeared
without
a
soul
on
board
being
able
to
save
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
_
Galatea
_
and
_
Hannibal
_
,
with
their
torpedo
boats
,
were
sustaining
serious
injuries
from
the
heavy
bow
fire
,
and
there
seemed
every
possibility
that
they
too
would
share
the
same
terrible
fate
as
the
_
Narcissus
_
,
when
suddenly
one
of
the
officers
of
the
_
Galatea
_
discovered
three
vessels
approaching
.
<EOS>
The
"
demand
"
was
immediately
hoisted
,
and
responded
to
by
both
vessels
running
up
private
signals
.
<EOS>
With
an
expression
of
satisfaction
he
directed
the
attention
of
the
captain
to
the
fact
,
for
the
flags
of
the
first
-
named
vessel
showed
her
to
be
the
British
turret
-
ship
_
Monarch
_
,
and
those
of
the
second
the
great
barbette
-
ship
_
Rodney
_
,
while
a
moment
later
it
was
discerned
that
the
third
vessel
was
the
_
Gorgon
_
.
 
<EOS>
Even
as
they
looked
,
other
masts
appeared
upon
the
horizon
,
and
then
they
knew
relief
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Both
vessels
ran
up
signals
,
while
the
men
,
encouraged
by
the
knowledge
that
some
powerful
British
ironclads
were
bearing
down
to
their
aid
in
indented
line
ahead
,
worked
with
increased
vigour
to
keep
the
enemy
at
bay
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fierce
,
sanguinary
fight
.
<EOS>
Fire
vomited
from
all
the
vessels
'
battered
works
,
and
the
scuppers
ran
with
blood
.
<EOS>
The
French
vessels
,
having
apparently
also
noticed
the
relief
approaching
,
did
not
seem
inclined
to
fight
,
but
were
nevertheless
compelled
,
and
not
for
a
single
instant
did
the
firing
from
the
attacked
vessels
cease
.
<EOS>
Their
guns
showed
constant
bursts
of
flame
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
,
however
,
the
_
Rodney
_
drew
within
range
.
<EOS>
A
puff
of
white
smoke
from
her
barbette
,
and
the
_
Cecille
_
received
a
taste
of
her
quick
-
firing
guns
,
the
shots
from
which
struck
her
amidships
,
killing
a
large
number
of
her
men
,
and
tearing
up
her
deck
.
<EOS>
This
was
followed
by
deafening
discharges
from
the
four
25-ton
guns
of
the
_
Monarch
_
,
while
the
_
Gorgon
_
and
a
number
of
other
vessels
as
they
approached
all
took
part
in
the
conflict
,
the
engagement
quickly
becoming
general
.
<EOS>
With
great
precision
the
British
directed
their
fire
,
and
the
French
vessels
soon
prepared
to
beat
a
retreat
,
when
,
without
warning
,
a
frightful
explosion
occurred
on
board
the
_
Hirondelle
_
,
and
wreckage
mingled
with
human
limbs
shot
into
the
air
amid
a
great
sheet
of
flame
.
 
<EOS>
The
magazine
had
exploded
!
<EOS>
The
scene
on
board
the
doomed
vessel
,
even
as
witnessed
from
the
British
ships
,
was
awful
.
<EOS>
Terrified
men
left
their
guns
,
and
,
rushing
hither
and
thither
,
sought
means
of
escape
.
<EOS>
But
the
boats
had
already
been
smashed
by
shots
from
the
British
cruisers
,
and
all
knew
that
death
was
inevitable
.
 
<EOS>
The
burning
ship
slowly
foundered
beneath
them
,
and
as
they
rushed
about
in
despair
they
fell
back
into
the
roaring
flames
.
<EOS>
A
British
torpedo
boat
rescued
about
a
dozen
;
but
presently
,
with
a
heavy
list
,
the
warship
suddenly
swung
round
,
and
,
bow
first
,
disappeared
into
the
green
sunlit
sea
,
leaving
only
a
few
poor
wretches
,
who
,
after
struggling
vainly
on
the
surface
for
a
few
moments
,
also
went
down
to
the
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
The
carnage
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
men
were
being
launched
into
eternity
,
while
upon
the
horizon
both
east
and
west
dozens
of
ships
of
both
invaders
and
defenders
were
rapidly
approaching
,
and
all
would
,
ere
long
,
try
conclusions
.
 
<EOS>
Before
half
an
hour
had
passed
,
a
fierce
battle
,
as
sanguinary
as
any
in
the
world
's
history
,
had
commenced
.
<EOS>
The
cruisers
,
acting
as
satellites
to
the
battleships
forming
the
two
opposing
fighting
lines
,
had
quickly
commenced
a
series
of
fierce
skirmishes
and
duels
,
all
the
most
destructive
engines
of
modern
warfare
being
brought
into
play
.
 
<EOS>
The
division
of
our
Channel
Fleet
that
had
at
last
returned
consisted
of
the
powerful
battleship
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
,
flying
the
Admiral
's
flag
;
the
barbette
-
ships
_
Anson
_
,
_
Howe
_
,
_
Camperdown
_
,
and
_
Benbow
_
;
the
turret
-
ships
_
Thunderer
_
and
_
Conqueror
_
;
the
cruisers
_
Mersey
_
,
_
Terpsichore
_
,
_
Melampus
_
,
_
Tribune
_
,
_
Latona
_
,
_
Immortalite
_
,
and
_
Barham
_
;
with
the
torpedo
gunboats
_
Spanker
_
and
_
Speedwell
_
,
and
nineteen
torpedo
boats
.
 
<EOS>
The
forces
of
the
invaders
were
more
than
double
that
of
the
British
,
for
,
in
addition
to
the
vessels
already
enumerated
,
the
reinforcements
consisted
of
the
French
battleships
_
Amiral
Baudin
_
,
_
Formidable
_
,
_
Amiral
Duperre
_
,
_
Brennus
_
,
_
Trehouart
_

_
Jemappes
_
,
_
Terrible
_

_
Caiman
_
,
_
Courbet
_
,
_
Devastation
_
,
_
Redoubtable
_
,
and
_
Furieux
_
,
together
with
nine
cruisers
,
and
thirty
-
eight
_
torpilleurs
de
haute
mer
_
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
very
commencement
the
fighting
was
at
close
quarters
,
and
the
storm
of
shot
and
shell
caused
death
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
With
such
an
overwhelming
force
at
his
disposal
,
Admiral
Maigret
,
the
French
commander
,
had
been
enabled
to
take
up
a
position
which
boded
ill
for
the
defenders
,
nevertheless
the
British
Admiral
on
board
<EOS>
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
was
determined
to
exert
every
effort
to
repulse
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
thick
of
the
fight
the
great
flagship
steamed
along
,
her
compartments
closed
,
her
stokeholds
screwed
down
,
her
four
67-ton
guns
hurling
great
shots
from
her
barbettes
,
and
her
smaller
arms
pouring
out
a
continuous
deadly
fire
upon
the
French
ship
_
Indomptable
_
on
the
one
side
,
and
the
great
Russian
armoured
cruiser
_
Nicolai
I.
_
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
latter
the
British
vessel
's
shells
played
with
a
terribly
devastating
effect
,
bringing
down
the
large
forward
mast
and
the
machine
guns
in
her
fighting
tops
,
and
then
,
while
the
crew
worked
to
get
the
wreckage
clear
,
the
Maxim
,
Nordenfelt
,
and
Hotchkiss
guns
of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
suddenly
rattled
out
,
sweeping
with
their
metal
hail
her
opponent
's
deck
,
and
mowing
down
those
who
were
cutting
adrift
the
fallen
rigging
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
a
shell
struck
one
of
the
pair
of
guns
in
the
_
Nicolai
's
_
turret
,
rendering
it
useless
,
and
then
the
captain
of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
,
who
had
been
standing
in
the
conning
-
tower
calmly
awaiting
his
chance
,
touched
three
electric
knobs
in
rapid
succession
.
<EOS>
The
engines
throbbed
,
the
great
ship
moved
along
at
increasing
speed
through
dense
clouds
of
stifling
smoke
,
and
as
she
did
<EOS>
so
the
captain
shouted
an
order
which
had
the
effect
of
suddenly
turning
the
vessel
,
and
while
her
great
barbette
guns
roared
,
the
ram
of
the
British
vessel
crashed
into
the
broadside
of
the
Tsar
's
ship
with
a
terrific
impact
which
caused
her
to
shiver
from
stem
to
stern
.

Then
,
as
the
big
guns
in
her
rear
barbette
thundered
out
upon
the
_
Indomptable
_
,
whose
engines
had
broken
down
,
she
drew
gradually
back
from
the
terrible
breach
her
ram
had
made
under
the
water
-
line
of
her
opponent
,
and
the
latter
at
once
commenced
to
sink
.
<EOS>
The
force
of
the
impact
had
been
so
great
that
the
Russian
's
hull
was
absolutely
broken
in
two
,
and
as
the
iron
stretched
and
rent
like
paper
,
she
heaved
slowly
over
,
"
turning
turtle
,
"
and
carrying
down
with
her
over
three
hundred
officers
and
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
captain
now
turned
his
attention
to
the
French
ship
,
which
had
been
joined
in
the
attack
by
the
_
Brennus
_
,
the
fire
from
whose
58-ton
guns
at
close
quarters
played
great
havoc
with
the
British
flagship
's
superstructure
.
<EOS>
A
second
later
,
however
,
the
captain
of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
caught
the
_
Indomptable
_
in
an
unguarded
moment
,
and
,
springing
towards
one
of
the
electric
knobs
before
him
,
pressed
it
.
<EOS>
This
had
the
effect
of
ejecting
a
torpedo
from
one
of
the
bow
tubes
,
and
so
well
directed
was
it
that
a
few
seconds
later
there
was
a
deafening
report
,
as
part
of
the
stern
portion
of
the
French
ship
was
blown
away
,
raising
great
columns
of
spray
.
 
<EOS>
The
situation
was
awful
,
and
the
loss
of
life
everywhere
enormous
.
<EOS>
Dense
,
blinding
smoke
,
and
the
choking
fumes
of
melinite
,
obscured
the
sun
,
and
in
the
darkness
thus
caused
the
flames
from
the
guns
shed
a
lurid
light
upon
decks
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
.
<EOS>
The
cruisers
and
scouts
by
which
our
battleships
were
surrounded
cut
off
many
of
the
French
torpedo
boats
,
but
a
large
number
got
right
in
among
the
fleet
,
and
some
terrible
disasters
were
thus
caused
.
<EOS>
Once
inside
the
circle
of
British
cruisers
,
all
fire
directed
at
the
boats
was
as
dangerous
to
our
own
ships
as
to
the
enemy
's
boats
.
 
<EOS>
The
superiority
of
the
French
torpedo
boats
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
keenly
felt
by
the
British
,
for
in
the
course
of
the
first
hour
five
of
our
cruisers
--
the
_
Terpsichore
_
,
_
Galatea
_
,
_
Melampus
_
,
_
Tribune
_
,
_
Mersey
_
,
the
turret
-
ship
_
Conqueror
_
,
and
the
battleships
_
Hannibal
_
and
_
Rodney
_
,
had
been
blown
up
.
<EOS>
As
compared
with
these
losses
,
those
of
the
enemy
were
at
this
stage
by
no
means
small
.
<EOS>
The
French
had
lost
two
cruisers
and
four
torpedo
boats
,
and
the
Russians
one
battleship
,
three
cruisers
,
and
six
torpedo
boats
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
,
with
all
these
fearful
odds
against
them
,
still
continued
a
galling
fire
.
<EOS>
The
_
Camperdown
_
,
_
Anson
_
,
and
_
Benbow
_
,
steaming
together
in
line
,
belched
a
storm
of
shell
from
their
barbettes
,
which
caused
wholesale
destruction
among
the
crowd
of
ships
engaging
them
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
withering
fire
of
the
enemy
was
telling
terribly
upon
the
comparatively
small
force
of
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
Upon
all
three
battleships
the
casualties
were
frightful
,
and
on
board
each
one
or
more
of
the
heavy
guns
had
been
disabled
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
shot
,
penetrating
a
weak
point
in
the
armour
of
the
_
Anson
_
,
entered
her
engine
-
room
,
disabling
a
portion
of
her
machinery
,
while
a
moment
later
a
shell
from
the
_
Amiral
Duperre
_
fell
close
to
her
broadside
torpedo
discharge
,
and
a
fragment
of
the
shell
coming
into
contact
with
the
striker
of
a
torpedo
,
just
as
it
was
about
to
leave
its
tube
,
caused
a
terrific
and
disastrous
explosion
between
the
decks
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
horrifying
.
<EOS>
The
torpedo
contained
over
70
lb
.
of
gun
-
cotton
,
therefore
the
devastating
nature
of
the
explosion
may
be
readily
imagined
.
<EOS>
Over
a
hundred
men
were
blown
to
atoms
,
and
the
whole
six
of
the
broadside
guns
were
more
or
less
disabled
.
 
<EOS>
A
second
later
,
however
,
a
shell
from
the
_
Benbow
_
struck
the
_
Amiral
Duperre
_
,
carrying
away
the
greater
portion
of
her
conning
-
tower
,
and
killing
her
captain
instantly
,
while
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
torpedo
from
one
of
the
British
boats
struck
her
bows
with
a
frightful
detonation
,
blowing
an
enormous
hole
in
them
.
<EOS>
The
catastrophe
was
complete
.
<EOS>
The
crew
of
the
doomed
ship
,
panic
-
stricken
,
left
their
guns
and
commenced
to
launch
the
only
two
boats
that
remained
uninjured
;
but
ere
this
could
be
accomplished
,
the
_
Trehouart
_
,
which
suddenly
went
astern
,
apparently
to
avoid
a
torpedo
,
crashed
into
her
,
with
the
result
that
she
heeled
right
over
and
quickly
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
_
Camperdown
_
,
fighting
fiercely
with
the
_
Requin
_
,
the
_
Terrible
_
,
and
the
_
Courbet
_
,
was
suffering
terrible
damage
from
bow
to
stern
;
nevertheless
her
guns
kept
up
an
incessant
torrent
of
shot
,
until
suddenly
,
just
after
one
of
her
shells
had
struck
right
under
the
turret
of
the
_
Terrible
_
,
there
was
a
deafening
report
,
the
air
was
filled
with
dense
smoke
,
and
the
French
ship
,
with
her
engines
disabled
,
commenced
to
fill
and
sink
.
 
<EOS>
A
portion
of
the
shell
had
penetrated
to
her
magazine
,
and
she
had
blown
up
,
nearly
half
her
crew
being
killed
by
the
terrific
force
of
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
remaining
men
,
however
,
scrambled
on
board
the
_
Caiman
_
,
which
by
some
means
had
come
into
slight
collision
with
her
;
but
scarcely
had
the
last
terrified
man
left
the
sinking
vessel
,
when
the
_
Camperdown
's
_
powerful
ram
entered
the
_
Caiman
's
_
bows
,
breaking
her
hull
,
and
she
also
foundered
,
carrying
down
with
her
not
only
her
own
crew
,
but
also
the
survivors
of
the
_
Terrible
_
.
 
<EOS>
This
success
was
witnessed
with
satisfaction
by
the
British
Admiral
,
who
nevertheless
saw
how
seriously
weakened
was
his
force
,
and
how
critical
was
the
position
of
his
few
remaining
ships
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
remained
quite
cool
,
for
the
heavy
guns
of
the
steel
monster
in
whose
conning
-
tower
he
stood
<EOS>
continued
thundering
forth
their
projectiles
,
and
the
White
Ensign
still
loomed
defiantly
through
the
dense
black
smoke
,
fluttering
in
the
freshening
breeze
that
was
now
springing
up
.
 
<EOS>
Although
a
number
of
the
enemy
's
vessels
had
been
sunk
,
he
knew
the
issue
must
be
fatal
to
his
force
,
for
they
were
now
surrounded
by
a
number
of
ships
so
vastly
superior
to
them
in
armament
and
speed
,
that
to
die
fighting
was
their
only
course
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
cockpits
were
full
,
true
British
indomitable
courage
was
showing
itself
everywhere
on
board
our
ships
.
<EOS>
Officers
by
words
of
encouragement
incited
their
men
to
splendid
heroic
deeds
,
and
guns
'
crews
,
with
dark
determined
faces
,
seeing
only
death
ahead
,
resolved
to
fight
and
struggle
to
the
last
for
the
honour
of
the
Union
Jack
,
which
should
never
be
surmounted
by
the
Tricolor
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
later
,
the
captain
,
standing
with
the
Admiral
,
who
had
just
entered
the
conning
-
tower
of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
,
suddenly
uttered
a
cry
of
dismay
,
and
with
transfixed
,
horrified
gaze
pointed
with
his
finger
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Breathlessly
the
Admiral
looked
in
the
direction
indicated
.
 
<EOS>
Though
one
of
the
bravest
men
in
the
Navy
,
and
on
his
breast
he
wore
the
Victoria
Cross
,
his
eyes
fell
upon
a
sight
that
appalled
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
critical
moment
.
 
<EOS>
A
small
French
vessel
,
the
unarmoured
cruiser
_
Faucon
_
,
had
crept
up
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
The
attention
of
the
British
officers
had
been
,
until
that
moment
,
concentrated
upon
the
three
powerful
battleships
,
the
_
Requin
_
,
the
_
Devastation
_
,
and
the
_
Jemappes
_
,
which
kept
up
their
hot
fire
upon
the
flagship
,
causing
terrible
destruction
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
the
British
Admiral
saw
himself
surrounded
by
the
enemy
,
and
the
sight
which
caused
his
heart
to
beat
quickly
was
a
distinct
line
of
bubbles
upon
the
water
,
advancing
with
terrific
speed
,
showing
that
a
torpedo
had
been
ejected
from
the
_
Faucon
_
directly
at
his
ship
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
conning
-
tower
all
knew
their
danger
,
but
not
a
man
spoke
.
<EOS>
Both
the
Admiral
and
the
captain
at
the
same
instant
saw
the
death
-
dealing
projectile
advancing
,
and
both
retained
their
coolness
and
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
The
captain
,
shouting
an
order
,
sprang
back
and
touched
one
of
the
electric
signals
,
which
was
instantly
responded
to
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
work
of
a
second
.
<EOS>
The
great
engines
roared
and
throbbed
,
and
the
huge
vessel
,
propelled
backwards
by
its
13,000
horse
-
power
,
swung
steadily
round
just
as
the
torpedo
glanced
off
her
bow
obliquely
.
<EOS>
The
crew
of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
had
never
been
nearer
death
than
at
that
instant
.
<EOS>
Had
the
ironclad
not
halted
in
her
course
,
the
striker
of
the
torpedo
would
have
come
square
upon
her
bows
,
and
one
of
the
finest
vessels
of
the
British
Navy
would
have
probably
gone
to
the
bottom
.
 
<EOS>
The
_
Faucon
_
was
not
given
an
opportunity
to
make
a
second
attempt
.
<EOS>
The
captain
of
the
_
Anson
_
had
witnessed
how
narrowly
the
British
flagship
had
escaped
,
and
immediately
turned
his
great
guns
upon
the
little
vessel
,
with
the
result
that
her
quick
-
firing
guns
were
quickly
rendered
useless
,
her
hull
was
torn
up
like
paper
,
and
she
slowly
sank
without
offering
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
Shots
came
from
the
frowning
barbettes
of
the
_
Camperdown
_
,
_
Benbow
_
,
and
the
turrets
of
the
_
Monarch
_
rapidly
,
the
damage
and
loss
of
life
suffered
by
the
enemy
now
being
enormous
.
<EOS>
The
three
French
battleships
engaging
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
at
close
quarters
received
terrible
punishment
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
75-ton
guns
of
the
_
Requin
_
had
been
rendered
useless
,
her
deck
had
been
torn
up
,
and
her
bulwarks
had
been
carried
away
,
together
with
her
funnel
and
forward
mast
.
<EOS>
The
rear
barbette
gun
of
the
_
Jemappes
_
had
been
thrown
off
its
mounting
,
and
a
shell
striking
the
port
side
battery
,
had
burst
against
the
forward
bulkhead
,
and
wrought
horrible
destruction
among
the
guns
'
crews
.
 
<EOS>
The
three
powerful
French
vessels
pouring
their
fire
upon
the
British
flagship
,
and
finding
themselves
being
raked
by
the
heavy
fire
of
their
adversary
,
signalled
the
_
Tonnerre
_
and
_
Furieux
_
to
assist
them
.
<EOS>
Both
vessels
drew
nearer
,
and
soon
afterwards
commenced
pounding
at
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
.
 
<EOS>
The
_
Anson
_
,
however
,
noticed
the
dangerous
position
of
the
British
flagship
,
and
,
having
manoeuvred
adroitly
,
succeeded
in
getting
under
way
,
and
with
her
great
forward
guns
thundering
,
she
crashed
her
ram
into
the
_
Furieux
_
,
and
sank
her
,
while
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
torpedo
,
discharged
from
one
of
the
British
boats
,
struck
the
_
Tonnerre
_
right
amidships
,
dealing
her
a
blow
from
which
she
could
never
recover
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
later
,
the
_
Gangut
_
,
fighting
desperately
at
close
quarters
with
the
_
Camperdown
_
,
had
part
of
her
armoured
casemate
blown
away
,
and
the
British
battleship
followed
up
this
success
by
directing
a
torpedo
at
her
in
such
a
manner
that
,
although
she
drew
back
quickly
to
avoid
it
,
she
nevertheless
received
it
right
under
her
stern
.
<EOS>
Some
ammunition
on
board
that
vessel
also
exploded
,
and
the
effect
was
frightful
,
for
fragments
of
wood
,
iron
,
and
human
bodies
were
precipitated
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
The
loss
of
life
,
although
heavy
on
the
British
side
,
was
nevertheless
far
greater
on
board
the
enemy
's
ships
.
<EOS>
The
continuity
and
precision
of
the
British
fire
wrought
awful
destruction
.
<EOS>
Between
the
decks
of
many
of
the
French
and
Russian
ships
the
carnage
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Among
wrecked
guns
and
mountings
lay
headless
and
armless
bodies
;
human
limbs
shattered
by
shells
were
strewn
in
all
directions
upon
decks
slippery
with
blood
.
<EOS>
The
shrieks
of
the
dying
were
drowned
by
the
roar
and
crash
of
the
guns
,
the
deafening
explosion
of
shells
,
and
the
rending
of
iron
and
steel
as
the
projectiles
pierced
armourplates
,
destroying
everything
with
which
they
came
in
contact
.
 
<EOS>
The
noon
had
passed
,
and
as
the
day
wore
on
other
catastrophes
occurred
involving
further
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
was
the
accidental
ramming
of
the
_
Sfax
_
by
the
French
battleship
_
Redoubtable
_
,
which
managed
,
however
,
to
save
the
greater
portion
of
the
crew
,
although
her
engines
broke
down
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
afternoon
the
fire
from
the
British
ships
seemed
to
increase
rather
than
diminish
,
notwithstanding
each
vessel
flying
the
White
Ensign
<EOS>
fought
more
than
one
of
the
enemy
's
ships
,
and
in
doing
so
constantly
received
shots
that
spread
death
and
destruction
between
the
decks
.
<EOS>
Still
,
amid
the
blinding
smoke
,
the
din
of
battle
,
and
the
constant
roaring
of
the
guns
,
British
bluejackets
with
smoke
-
begrimed
faces
worked
enthusiastically
for
the
defence
of
Old
England
.
<EOS>
Many
heroic
deeds
were
performed
that
memorable
afternoon
,
and
many
a
gallant
hero
was
sent
to
an
untimely
grave
.
 
<EOS>
On
board
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
<EOS>
_
the
destruction
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
By
four
o'clock
many
of
the
guns
had
been
disabled
,
half
the
crew
had
perished
,
and
the
decks
ran
with
the
life
-
blood
of
Britain
's
gallant
defenders
.
<EOS>
The
captain
had
been
struck
upon
the
forehead
by
a
flying
fragment
of
shell
,
causing
a
fearful
wound
;
yet
,
with
his
head
enveloped
in
a
hastily
improvised
bandage
,
he
stuck
to
his
post
.
<EOS>
He
was
engaging
the
_
Redoubtable
_
and
getting
the
worst
of
it
,
when
suddenly
,
having
manoeuvred
once
or
twice
,
he
turned
to
his
lieutenant
,
saying
,
"
Lay
guns
,
ahead
full
speed
,
and
prepare
to
ram
.
<EOS>
"
The
officer
addressed
transmitted
the
order
,
and
a
few
moments
later
,
as
her
guns
thundered
forth
,
the
bows
of
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
entered
the
broadside
of
the
French
ship
with
a
loud
crash
,
ripping
her
almost
in
half
.
 
<EOS>
Backing
again
quickly
as
the
_
Redoubtable
_
sank
<EOS>
,
she
suddenly
received
a
shock
which
made
her
reel
and
shiver
.
<EOS>
A
shell
from
the
Russian
flagship
had
struck
under
her
stern
barbette
,
but
,
failing
to
penetrate
the
armour
,
glanced
off
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Fiercer
and
more
fierce
became
the
fight
.
<EOS>
A
well
-
directed
shot
from
one
of
the
67-ton
guns
on
the
_
Anson
's
_
rear
barbette
struck
the
conning
-
tower
of
the
_
Magenta
_
,
blowing
it
away
,
killing
the
captain
and
those
who
were
directing
the
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
was
sinking
,
but
the
battle
still
raged
with
unabated
fury
.
<EOS>
Each
side
struggled
desperately
for
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
The
British
,
fighting
nobly
against
what
had
all
along
been
overwhelming
odds
,
had
succeeded
in
sinking
some
of
the
enemy
's
finest
ships
,
and
inflicting
terrible
loss
upon
the
crews
of
the
others
;
yet
the
British
Admiral
,
on
viewing
the
situation
,
was
compelled
to
admit
that
he
was
outnumbered
,
and
that
a
continuance
of
the
struggle
would
inevitably
result
in
the
loss
of
other
of
his
ships
.
<EOS>
There
still
remained
three
of
the
enemy
's
vessels
to
each
one
of
the
British
.
<EOS>
His
ships
were
all
more
or
less
crippled
,
therefore
a
successful
stand
against
the
still
overwhelming
force
would
be
sheer
madness
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
the
sort
of
man
to
show
the
white
feather
;
nevertheless
a
retreat
upon
Portsmouth
had
now
become
a
matter
of
policy
,
and
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
a
few
minutes
later
ran
up
signals
intimating
to
the
other
vessels
her
intention
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
British
Squadron
moved
away
down
Channel
the
hoarse
exultant
shouts
of
the
enemy
filled
the
air
.
<EOS>
But
the
fighting
became
even
more
desperate
,
and
for
over
an
hour
there
was
a
most
exciting
chase
.
<EOS>
The
running
fire
did
little
harm
to
the
retreating
ships
,
but
their
stern
guns
played
terrible
havoc
with
the
French
and
Russian
torpedo
boats
,
which
were
picked
off
one
after
another
with
remarkable
rapidity
.
 
<EOS>
Off
Littlehampton
one
of
the
Russian
ships
ran
up
signals
,
and
immediately
the
enemy
's
ships
slackened
.
<EOS>
Apparently
they
had
no
desire
to
follow
further
west
,
for
after
a
few
parting
shots
they
turned
and
stood
away
up
Channel
again
,
while
the
surviving
ships
of
the
British
Squadron
steamed
onward
in
the
blood
-
red
track
of
the
dying
day
.
 
<EOS>
At
their
head
was
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
,
battered
,
and
bearing
marks
of
the
deadly
strife
;
but
bright
against
the
clear
,
calm
evening
sky
,
the
British
flag
,
half
of
which
had
been
shot
away
,
still
fluttered
out
in
the
cool
breeze
of
sunset
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
Lion
had
shown
his
teeth
.
<EOS>
Alas
,
that
our
Navy
should
have
been
so
weak
!
<EOS>
Several
of
the
ships
had
had
their
engines
severely
damaged
or
broken
,
but
our
margin
of
additional
strength
was
so
small
that
we
had
no
vessels
wherewith
to
replace
those
compelled
to
return
to
port
.
 
<EOS>
The
struggle
in
this
,
the
first
naval
battle
in
the
defence
of
our
Empire
,
had
been
desperate
,
and
the
loss
of
life
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
The
First
Act
of
the
most
sanguinary
drama
of
modern
nations
had
closed
.
 
<EOS>
What
would
be
its
_
denouement

<EOS>
THE
DOOM
OF
HULL
.
  
<EOS>
In
Hull
forty
-
eight
long
weary
hours
of
anxious
suspense
and
breathless
excitement
had
passed
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
dark
,
the
sky
overcast
,
and
there
was
in
the
air
that
oppressive
sultry
stillness
precursory
of
a
storm
.
 
<EOS>
Church
clocks
had
chimed
ten
,
yet
most
of
the
shops
were
still
open
,
and
the
well
-
lighted
streets
of
the
drab
old
Yorkshire
town
were
filled
by
a
pale
-
faced
,
terror
-
stricken
crowd
surging
down
the
thoroughfares
towards
the
Victoria
Pier
.
<EOS>
A
panic
had
suddenly
been
created
an
hour
before
by
the
issue
of
an
extra
-
special
edition
of
the
Hull
evening
paper
,
the
_
Daily
News
_
,
containing
a
brief
telegram
in
large
type
,
as
follows:--
     
<EOS>
The
Coastguard
at
Donna
Nook
report
that
a
strong
force
of
    
Russian
war
vessels
,
including
the
turret
-
ship
_
Sevastopol
_
and
    
the
barbette
-
ships
_
Sinope
_
and
_
Cizoi
Veliky
_
,
have
just
hove
    
in
sight
and
are
making
for
the
Humber
.
<EOS>
Lloyd
's
signal
station
    
on
Spurn
Point
has
also
intimated
that
hostile
ships
coming
from
    
the
south
are
lying
-
to
just
beyond
the
Lightship
.
 
<EOS>
The
papers
sold
more
quickly
than
they
could
be
printed
,
a
shilling
each
being
given
for
copies
by
the
excited
townspeople
,
who
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
suddenly
realised
that
the
enemy
was
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Men
and
boys
with
bundles
of
limp
papers
,
damp
from
the
press
,
rushed
along
Whitefriargate
,
away
in
every
direction
into
the
suburbs
,
shouting
the
appalling
intelligence
in
hoarse
,
strident
tones
that
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
quieter
thoroughfares
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
even
as
purchasers
of
papers
read
the
few
lines
of
print
under
the
dim
uncertain
light
of
street
lamps
,
the
dull
booming
of
distant
guns
fell
upon
their
ears
,
and
the
populace
,
wildly
excited
,
made
their
way
with
one
accord
towards
the
Victoria
Pier
,
to
glean
the
latest
news
,
and
ascertain
the
true
significance
of
the
repeated
firing
.
 
<EOS>
Was
Hull
in
danger
?
<EOS>
Would
the
enemy
advance
up
the
river
and
bombard
the
town
?
<EOS>
These
all
-
important
questions
were
on
every
one
's
tongue
,
and
as
the
thousands
of
all
classes
rushed
hither
and
thither
,
wild
rumours
of
the
enemy
's
intentions
spread
and
increased
the
horror
.
 
<EOS>
Within
an
hour
of
the
publication
of
the
first
intimation
of
the
presence
of
the
invaders
the
excitement
had
become
intense
,
and
the
narrow
streets
and
narrower
bridges
had
become
congested
by
a
terror
-
stricken
multitude
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
thunder
of
heavy
guns
shook
the
town
,
causing
windows
to
clatter
,
and
the
people
standing
on
the
pier
and
along
the
riverside
strained
their
eyes
into
the
cavernous
darkness
towards
the
sea
.
<EOS>
But
they
could
discern
nothing
.
<EOS>
Across
at
New
Holland
,
two
miles
away
,
lamps
twinkled
,
but
the
many
lights
--
red
,
white
,
and
green
--
that
stud
the
broad
river
for
the
guidance
of
the
mariner
had
,
since
the
Declaration
of
War
,
been
extinguished
.
<EOS>
The
familiar
distant
lights
that
had
never
failed
to
shine
seaward
at
Salt
End
and
Thorngumbald
no
longer
shed
their
radiance
,
and
from
the
revolving
lights
at
Spurn
<EOS>
no
stream
of
brilliancy
now
flashed
away
upon
the
rolling
waters
of
the
North
Sea
.
<EOS>
The
buoys
had
been
cut
adrift
,
the
Bull
Lightship
taken
from
her
moorings
,
and
the
entrance
to
Grimsby
harbour
was
unillumined
.
<EOS>
Not
a
star
appeared
in
the
sky
,
for
all
was
dark
,
black
,
and
threatening
.
<EOS>
Through
the
hot
,
heavy
atmosphere
the
roar
of
cannon
came
from
the
direction
of
Spurn
Point
,
and
as
the
sounds
of
the
shots
fell
upon
the
ears
of
the
anxious
watchers
,
they
stood
aghast
,
wondering
what
would
be
their
destiny
.
 
<EOS>
The
suspense
was
awful
.
<EOS>
Men
,
women
,
and
children
,
with
scared
faces
,
stood
in
groups
in
the
market
-
place
,
in
Queen
Street
,
and
in
High
Street
,
discussing
the
situation
.
<EOS>
This
question
,
however
,
was
already
engaging
the
attention
of
the
municipal
and
military
authorities
,
for
on
hearing
the
alarming
news
the
Mayor
,
with
shrewd
promptitude
,
walked
quickly
to
the
Town
Hall
,
and
held
a
hurried
informal
consultation
with
Mr.
Charles
Wilson
,
Mr.
Arthur
Wilson
,
Mr.
Richardson
,
Major
Wellsted
,
Alderman
Woodhouse
,
and
a
number
of
aldermen
and
councillors
.
<EOS>
All
knew
the
town
was
in
peril
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
could
have
but
one
object
in
entering
the
Humber
.
<EOS>
Yet
it
was
agreed
that
no
steps
could
be
taken
at
such
brief
notice
to
defend
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
guardship
_
Edinburgh
_
had
been
withdrawn
to
form
part
of
the
squadron
upon
which
they
would
be
compelled
to
rely
,
with
the
batteries
at
Paull
and
the
submarine
mines
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
evident
by
the
firing
that
an
attack
upon
the
British
Squadron
had
commenced
.
<EOS>
The
shadow
of
impending
disaster
had
fallen
.
 
<EOS>
Working
men
,
hurrying
towards
the
pier
,
stopped
their
leader
,
Mr.
Millington
,
and
tried
to
learn
what
was
being
done
,
while
many
of
the
leading
townsfolk
were
thronged
around
for
information
,
and
were
centres
of
excited
groups
in
Whitefriargate
.
<EOS>
The
boatmen
,
sharply
questioned
on
every
hand
,
were
as
ignorant
of
the
state
of
affairs
as
those
seeking
information
,
so
nothing
could
be
done
except
to
wait
.
 
<EOS>
Women
and
children
of
the
middle
and
upper
classes
,
regardless
of
their
destination
,
were
being
hurried
away
by
anxious
fathers
.
<EOS>
Every
train
leaving
Hull
was
filled
to
overflowing
by
those
fleeing
from
the
advance
of
the
Russians
,
and
on
the
roads
inland
to
Beverley
,
Selby
,
and
Market
Weighton
crowds
of
every
class
hurried
away
to
seek
some
place
of
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
just
before
eleven
o'clock
,
the
thousands
anxiously
peering
over
the
wide
,
dark
waters
<EOS>
saw
away
on
the
bank
,
three
miles
distant
,
two
beams
of
white
light
,
which
slowly
swept
both
reaches
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
search
-
lights
of
the
battery
at
Paull
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
bright
streaks
shone
out
and
disappeared
when
they
were
followed
by
a
terrific
cannonade
from
the
forts
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
those
standing
on
the
Victoria
Pier
could
discern
the
enemy
's
ships
.
<EOS>
How
many
there
were
it
was
impossible
at
that
moment
to
tell
,
but
instantly
their
guns
flashed
and
thundered
at
the
forts
in
reply
.
<EOS>
Far
away
seaward
could
also
be
heard
low
booming
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
vessels
were
creeping
carefully
up
the
Humber
,
being
compelled
to
take
constant
soundings
on
account
of
the
removal
of
the
buoys
,
and
evidently
guided
by
foreign
pilots
who
had
for
years
been
permitted
to
take
vessels
up
and
down
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Moments
dragged
on
like
hours
,
each
bringing
the
town
of
Hull
nearer
its
fate
.
<EOS>
The
people
knew
it
,
but
were
powerless
.
<EOS>
They
stood
awaiting
the
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
The
Russian
force
,
besides
the
three
vessels
already
mentioned
,
included
the
armoured
cruiser
_
Dimitri
Donskoi
_
,
the
central
-
battery
ship
<EOS>
_
Kniaz
Pojarski
_
,
the
cruiser
_
Pamyat
Merkuriya
_
,
two
of
the
new
armoured
cruisers
,
_
Mezen
_
and
_
Syzran
_
,
of
the
_
Rurik
_
type
,
the
corvette
_
Razboynik
_
<EOS>
,
the
torpedo
gunboats
_
Griden
_
and
_
Gaidamak
_
,
and
the
armoured
gunboat
_
Gremyastchy
_
,
with
several
torpedo
boats
.
 
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
they
had
manoeuvred
to
pass
Spurn
Point
and
ascend
the
river
was
remarkable
,
and
astounded
the
officers
in
the
forts
at
Paull
.
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
were
not
aware
that
each
captain
of
those
vessels
possessed
a
copy
of
the
British
secret
code
and
other
important
information
compiled
from
the
documents
filched
from
the
body
of
the
Admiralty
messenger
by
the
Count
von
Beilstein
at
the
Mariners
'
Rest
at
Deal
!
 
<EOS>
The
possession
of
this
secret
knowledge
,
which
was
,
of
course
,
unknown
to
our
Admiralty
,
enabled
the
captains
of
the
Russian
vessels
to
evade
sunken
hulks
and
other
obstructions
,
and
take
some
of
their
ships
slowly
up
the
river
,
bearing
well
on
the
Lincolnshire
coast
,
so
as
to
keep
,
until
the
last
moment
,
out
of
the
range
of
the
search
-
lights
at
Paull
.
<EOS>
Then
,
on
the
first
attack
from
the
batteries
,
they
suddenly
replied
with
such
a
hail
of
shell
,
that
from
the
first
moment
it
was
clear
that
the
strength
of
the
fort
with
its
obsolete
guns
was
totally
inadequate
.
 
<EOS>
The
roar
of
the
cannonade
was
incessant
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
deafening
explosions
the
townspeople
of
Hull
rushed
up
and
down
the
streets
screaming
and
terrified
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
great
shell
fell
with
a
dull
thud
in
Citadel
Street
,
close
to
a
crowd
of
excited
women
,
and
exploding
a
second
later
,
blew
a
number
of
them
to
atoms
,
and
wrecked
the
fronts
of
several
houses
.
 
<EOS>
This
served
to
increase
the
panic
.
<EOS>
The
people
were
on
the
verge
of
madness
with
fright
and
despair
.
<EOS>
Thousands
seized
their
money
and
jewellery
and
fled
away
upon
the
roads
leading
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
Others
hid
away
their
valuables
,
and
preferred
to
remain
;
the
crisis
had
come
,
and
as
Britons
they
determined
to
face
it
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
Russian
ships
,
lying
broadside
-
on
in
positions
carefully
selected
to
avoid
the
electro
-
contact
mines
,
poured
their
terrible
fire
upon
the
land
battery
at
Paull
,
their
torpedo
boats
darted
hither
and
thither
with
extraordinary
rapidity
.
<EOS>
Several
were
sunk
by
shots
from
the
battery
,
but
four
piquet
boats
in
the
darkness
at
last
managed
to
creep
up
,
and
after
searching
,
seized
the
cable
connecting
the
mines
with
the
Submarine
Mining
Station
at
Paull
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
discovered
just
at
the
critical
moment
by
means
of
one
of
the
British
search
-
lights
,
and
upon
the
hostile
boats
a
frightful
cascade
of
projectiles
was
poured
by
the
quick
-
firing
guns
of
the
battery
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
,
alas
,
too
late
!
<EOS>
The
cable
had
been
cut
.
<EOS>
To
the
whole
of
the
wires
a
small
electric
battery
had
in
a
moment
been
attached
,
and
as
the
guns
of
the
fort
crashed
out
there
were
a
series
of
dull
explosions
under
the
bed
of
the
river
across
the
channel
from
Foul
Holme
Sand
to
Killingholme
Haven
,
and
from
Paull
Coastguard
Station
to
the
Skitter
.
 
<EOS>
The
dark
water
rose
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
mines
had
been
simultaneously
fired
!
 
<EOS>
Cheers
rang
out
from
the
Russian
vessels
,
sounding
above
the
heavy
cannonade
.
<EOS>
The
destruction
of
this
most
important
portion
of
the
defences
of
the
Humber
had
been
accomplished
by
the
boats
just
at
the
very
instant
when
they
were
shattered
by
British
shells
,
and
ere
the
waters
grew
calm
again
the
last
vestige
of
the
boats
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
officers
at
Paull
worked
on
with
undaunted
courage
,
striving
by
every
means
in
their
power
to
combat
with
the
superior
forces
.
<EOS>
In
a
measure
,
too
,
they
were
successful
,
for
such
havoc
did
the
shells
play
with
the
gunboat
_
Gremyastchy
_
that
she
slowly
foundered
,
and
her
crew
were
compelled
to
abandon
her
.
<EOS>
A
portion
of
the
men
were
rescued
by
the
_
Syzran
_
,
but
two
boatloads
were
precipitated
into
the
water
,
and
nearly
all
were
drowned
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
big
guns
of
the
_
Dimitri
Donskoi
_
were
disabled
,
and
the
loss
of
life
on
several
of
the
ships
was
considerable
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
firing
was
still
incessant
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
9-ton
guns
of
the
_
Kniaz
Pojarski
_
and
the
four
131/2-tonners
of
the
_
Mezen
_
threw
their
terrible
missiles
upon
the
defences
at
Paull
with
frightful
effect
,
until
at
length
,
after
a
most
desperate
,
stubborn
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
British
commander
of
the
battery
,
and
after
half
the
defending
force
had
been
killed
,
the
guns
suddenly
ceased
.
 
<EOS>
Both
land
and
sea
defences
had
been
broken
down
!
<EOS>
The
Russians
were
now
free
to
advance
upon
Hull
!
 
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
was
lost
.
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
after
the
guns
of
Paull
had
been
silenced
,
the
enemy
's
ships
,
moving
very
cautiously
forward
,
opened
a
withering
fire
upon
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
horrors
of
that
bombardment
were
frightful
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
of
the
first
shots
,
fired
almost
simultaneously
from
the
two
big
guns
of
the
_
Syzran
_
,
the
panic
became
indescribable
.
<EOS>
Both
shells
burst
with
loud
detonations
and
frightfully
devastating
effect
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
striking
one
of
the
domes
of
the
Dock
Office
,
carried
it
bodily
away
,
at
the
same
time
killing
several
persons
;
while
the
other
,
crashing
upon
the
Exchange
,
unroofed
it
,
and
blew
away
the
colossal
statue
of
Britannia
which
surmounted
the
parapet
on
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Surely
this
was
an
omen
of
impending
disaster
!
 
<EOS>
Ere
the
horrified
inhabitants
could
again
draw
breath
,
the
air
was
rent
by
a
terrific
crash
,
as
simultaneously
flame
rushed
from
the
guns
of
the
_
Kniaz
Pojarski
_
,
the
_
Pamyat
Merkuriya
_
,
and
the
_
Mezen
_
,
and
great
shells
were
hurled
into
the
town
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
The
place
trembled
and
shook
as
if
struck
by
an
earthquake
,
and
everywhere
walls
fell
and
buildings
collapsed
.

Long
bright
beams
of
the
search

lights
swept
the
town
and
neighbouring
country
,
lighting
up
the
turbulent
streets
like
day
,
and
as
the
crowds
rushed
headlong
from
the
river
,
shot
and
shell
struck
in

killing
hundreds

starving

Lying
off
Salt

the
_
Cizoi
Veliky
_
,
which
had
now
come
up
the
river
in
company
with
two
torpedo
boats
,
poured
from
her
barbette
a
heavy
fire
upon
the
Alexandra
Dock
and
Earle
's
shipbuilding
yard
,
while
the
other
vessels
,
approaching
nearer
,
wrought
terrible
destruction
with
every
shot
in
various
other
parts
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
many
streets
were
impassable
,
owing
to
the
fallen
buildings
,
and
in
dozens
of
places
the
explosion
of
the
melinite
shells
had
set
on
fire
the
ruined
houses
.
 
<EOS>
Missiles
hurled
from
such
close
quarters
by
such
heavy
guns
wrought
the
most
fearful
havoc
.
<EOS>
Naturally
,
the
Russian
gunners
,
discovering
the
most
prominent
buildings
with
their
search
-
lights
,
aimed
at
them
and
destroyed
many
of
the
public
edifices
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
first
prominent
structures
to
topple
and
fall
was
the
Wilberforce
Monument
,
and
then
,
in
rapid
succession
,
shots
carried
away
another
dome
of
the
Dock
Office
,
and
the
great
square
towers
of
St.
John
's
and
Holy
Trinity
Churches
.
<EOS>
The
gaudily
gilded
equestrian
statue
of
King
William
III
.
<EOS>
was
flung
from
its
pedestal
and
smashed
by
a
heavy
shot
,
which
entered
a
shop
opposite
,
completely
wrecking
it
;
and
two
shells
,
striking
the
handsome
offices
of
the
Hull
Banking
Company
at
the
corner
of
Silver
Street
,
reduced
the
building
to
a
heap
of
ruins
.
<EOS>
Deadly
shells
fell
in
quick
succession
in
Paragon
Street
,
and
at
the
North
-
Eastern
Railway
Station
,
where
the
lines
and
platforms
were
torn
up
,
and
the
Station
Hotel
,
being
set
on
fire
,
was
soon
burning
fiercely
,
for
the
flames
spread
unchecked
here
,
as
in
every
other
quarter
.
<EOS>
Church
spires
fell
crashing
into
neighbouring
houses
,
whole
rows
of
shops
were
demolished
in
Whitefriargate
,
High
Street
,
and
Saville
Street
,
and
roads
were
everywhere
torn
up
by
the
enemy
's
exploding
missiles
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
a
moment
was
there
a
pause
in
this
awful
work
of
destruction
;
not
for
a
moment
was
the
frightful
massacre
of
the
inhabitants
suspended
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
sole
object
was
apparently
to
weaken
the
northern
defences
of
London
by
drawing
back
the
Volunteer
battalions
to
the
north
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
reason
to
bombard
after
the
fort
had
been
silenced
,
yet
they
had
decided
to
destroy
the
town
and
cause
the
most
widespread
desolation
possible
.
 
<EOS>
Flame
flashed
from
the
muzzles
of
those
great
desolating
guns
so
quickly
as
to
appear
like
one
brilliant
,
incessant
light
.
<EOS>
Shells
from
the
_
Cizoi
Veliky
_
fell
into
the
warehouses
around
the
Alexandra
Dock
,
and
these
,
with
the
fine
new
grain
warehouses
on
each
side
of
the
river
Hull
,
were
blazing
furiously
with
a
terrible
roar
.
<EOS>
High
into
the
air
great
tongues
of
flame
leaped
,
their
volume
increased
by
the
crowd
of
ships
in
the
dock
also
igniting
in
rapid
succession
,
shedding
a
lurid
glare
over
the
terrible
scene
,
and
lighting
up
the
red
,
angry
sky
.
<EOS>
The
long
range
of
warehouses
,
filled
with
inflammable
goods
,
at
the
edge
of
the
Albert
and
William
Wright
Docks
,
were
on
fire
,
while
the
warehouses
of
the
Railway
Dock
,
together
with
a
large
number
of
Messrs.
Thomas
Wilson
's
fine
steamers
,
were
also
in
flames
.
<EOS>
Such
a
hold
had
the
flames
obtained
that
no
power
could
arrest
them
,
and
as
the
glare
increased
it
was
seen
by
those
flying
for
their
lives
that
the
whole
of
the
port
was
now
involved
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
petroleum
stores
of
the
Anglo
-
American
Company
,
struck
by
a
shell
,
exploded
a
few
moments
later
with
a
most
terrific
and
frightful
detonation
which
shook
the
town
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
seemed
as
if
both
town
and
river
were
enveloped
in
one
great
sheet
of
flame
,
then
,
as
blazing
oil
ran
down
the
gutters
on
every
side
,
fierce
fires
showed
,
and
whole
streets
were
alight
from
end
to
end
.
 
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
persons
perished
in
the
flames
,
hundreds
were
shot
down
by
the
fragments
of
flying
missiles
,
and
hundreds
more
were
buried
under
falling
ruins
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
roar
of
flames
mingled
with
the
shrieks
of
the
dying
.
<EOS>
Shells
striking
the
Royal
Infirmary
burst
in
the
wards
,
killing
many
patients
in
their
beds
,
and
setting
fire
to
the
building
,
while
others
,
crashing
through
the
roof
of
the
Theatre
Royal
,
carried
away
one
of
the
walls
and
caused
the
place
to
ignite
.
<EOS>
One
shot
from
the
13-ton
gun
of
the
_
Syzran
_
tore
its
way
into
the
nave
of
Holy
Trinity
Church
,
and
,
exploding
,
blew
out
the
three
beautiful
windows
and
wrecked
the
interior
,
while
another
from
the
same
gun
demolished
one
of
the
corner
buildings
of
the
new
Market
Hall
.
<EOS>
The
handsome
tower
of
the
Town
Hall
,
struck
by
a
shell
just
under
the
dial

came
down
with
a
frightful
crash
,
completely
blocking
Lowgate
with
its
debris
,
and
almost
at
the
same
instant
a
shot
came
through
the
dome
of
the
Council
Chamber
,
totally
destroying
the
apartment
.
 
<EOS>
The
Mariners
'
Hospital
and
Trinity
House
suffered
terribly
,
many
of
the
inmates
of
the
former
being
blown
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
One
shot
completely
demolished
the
Savings
Bank
at
the
corner
of
George
Street
,
and
a
shell
exploding
under
the
portico
of
the
Great
Thornton
Street
Chapel
blew
out
the
whole
of
its
dark
facade
.

Another
,
striking
the
extensive
premises
of
a
firm
of
lead
merchants
at
the
corner
of
Brook
and
Paragon
Streets
,
swept
away
the
range
of
buildings
like
grass
before
the
scythe
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Queen

,
Humber
,
Victoria
,
and
Prince

Docks
the
congested
crowd
of
idle
merchant
ships
were
enveloped
in
flames
that
wrapped
themselves
about
the
rigging
,
and
,
crackling
,
leaped
skyward
.
<EOS>
The
Orphanage
at
Spring

,
the
Artillery

and
Wilberforce
House
were
all
burning
;
in
fact

in
the
course
of
the
two
hours
during
which
the
bombardment
lasted
hardly
a
building

escaped

The

far
away
up
Spring

Anlaby

been
destroyed

Soon
after
two

when
the
Russian

ceased
their
thunder

the
whole

was
as
one
huge

the
intense

caused
the
Russian
Admiral

move
his

quickly

TERROR
ON
THE
TYNE

<EOS>
England
was
thrilled
,
dismayed
,
petrified

The
wholesale
massacre
at
Eastbourne
and
the
terrible
details
of
the
bombardment
of
Hull
had
spread
increased
horror
everywhere
throughout
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
Terror
reigned
on
the
Tyneside
.
<EOS>
Hospitals
,
asylums
,
and
public
institutions
,
crowded
with
affrighted
inmates
,
had
no
food
to
distribute
.
<EOS>
In
Newcastle
,
in
Shields
,
in
Jarrow
,
and
in
Gateshead
the
poor
were
idle
and
hungry
,
while
the
wealthy
were
feverishly
apprehensive
.
<EOS>
A
Sabbath
quiet
had
fallen
on
the
great
silent
highway
of
the
Tyne
.
<EOS>
In
those
blazing
days
and
breathless
nights
there
was
an
unbroken
stillness
that
portended
dire
disaster

In
the
enormous
crowded
districts
on
each
side
of
the
river
the
gaunt
spectre
Starvation
stalked
through
the
cheerless
homes
of
once
industrious
toilers
,
and
the
inmates
pined
and
died
.
<EOS>
So
terrible
was
the
distress
already
,
that
domestic
pets
were
being
killed
and
eaten
,
dogs
and
cats
being
no
uncommon
dish
,
the
very
offal
thrown
aside
being
greedily
devoured
by
those
slowly
succumbing
to
a
horrible
death
.
<EOS>
Awful
scenes
of
suffering
and
blank
despair
were
being
witnessed
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
after
the
enemy
had
ascended
the
Humber
and
dealt
such
a
decisive
blow
at
Hull
,
the
port
of
South
Shields
was
suddenly
alarmed
by
information
telegraphed
from
the
Coastguard
on
Harton
Down
Hill
,
about
a
mile
south
of
the
town
,
to
the
effect
that
they
had
sighted
a
number
of
French
and
Russian
ships
.
 
<EOS>
Panic
at
once
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
broad
market
-
place
was
filled
by
a
terror
-
stricken
crowd
of
townspeople
,
while
the
seafaring
population
surged
down
King
Street
and
Ocean
Road
,
across
the
park
to
the
long
South
Pier
at
the
entrance
to
the
Tyne
,
eager
to
reassure
themselves
that
the
enemy
had
no
designs
upon
their
town
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
dull
red
afterglow
that
lit
up
the
broad
bay
of
golden
sand
between
Trow
Point
and
the
pier
,
a
huge
vessel
suddenly
loomed
dark
upon
the
sky
line
,
and
,
as
she
approached
,
those
watching
anxiously
through
glasses
made
her
out
as
the
great
steel
turret
-
ship
_
Lazare
Carnot
_
,
flying
the
French
Tricolor
.
<EOS>
Immediately
following
her
came
a

torpedo
boats

in
addition
to
those
which
were
at

As
the
vessels
steamed
onward
at
full
speed
,
the
people
rushed
from
the
pier
back
again
into
the
town
in
wild
disorder

while
the
Coastguard
at
Spanish
Battery
on
the
north
shore
of
the
estuary
,
having
now
discovered
the
presence

the
menacing

at

telegraphed
the
intelligence
up
to

most
profound
sensation
was
immediately
caused

The
news
spread
everywhere

knew
that

oppressor
was
upon
them

Suddenly
,
without
warning
,
smoke
tumbled
over
the
bows
of
the
_
Lazare
Carnot
_
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
low
boom
,
and
one
of
the
ponderous
guns
in
her
turret
sent
forth
an
enormous
shell
,
which
struck
the
battery
at
Trow
Point
,
blowing
away
a
portion
of
a
wall
.
 
<EOS>
A
moment
later
the
battery
replied
with
their
9-tonners
,
sending
forth
shot
after
shot
,
most
of
which
,
however
,
ricochetted
away
over
the
glassy
sea
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
signal
for
a
fight
which
quickly
became
desperate
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
half
a
dozen
of
the
ships
lay
broadside
on
,
and
the
great
guns
of
the
_
Massena
_
and
_
Neptune
_
,
with
those
of
four
other
vessels
,
opened
a
terrible
fire
upon
the
fort
,
casting
their
shells
upon
the
British
gunners
with
frightful
effect
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
battery
the
Armstrong
disappearing
guns
were
worked
to
their
utmost
capacity
,
and
the
shots
of
the
defenders
played
havoc
with
the
smaller
craft
,
three
torpedo
boats
and
a
"
catcher
"
being
sunk
in
as
many
minutes
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
_
Active
_
,
_
Bonaventure
_
,
_
Cambrian
_
,
_
Canada
_
,
and
_
Archer
<EOS>
_
of
the
Reserve
Squadron
,
now
on
its
way
from
the
north
of
Scotland
in
consequence
of
orders
from
the
Admiralty
having
reached
it
,
rounded
Sharpness
Point
,
and
steamed
full
upon
the
enemy
's
ships
.
 
<EOS>
The
conflict
was
fierce
,
but
quickly
ended
.
 
<EOS>
Heavy
fire
was
kept
up
from
the
fort
at
Tynemouth
,
from
Spanish
Battery
,
from
Trow
Battery
,
and
from
several
new
batteries
with
disappearing
guns
between
the
Groyne
and
the
quarry
at
Trow
,
that
had
been
constructed
and
manned
since
the
mobilisation
by
Volunteers
,
consisting
of
the
1st
Newcastle
Volunteer
Engineers
,
the
3rd
Durham
Volunteer
Artillery
,
and
the
4th
Durham
Light
Infantry
from
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
assistance
received
by
the
British
ships
from
the
land
was
of
but
little
avail
,
for
a
Russian
torpedo
boat
sent
forth
its
messenger
of
death
at
the
third
-
class
cruiser
_
Canada
_
,
blowing
her
up
,
while
the
engines
of
both
the
_
Active
_
and
_
Bonaventure
_
were
so
seriously
damaged
as
to
be
practically
useless
.
<EOS>
Rapid
signalling
by
the
semaphore
at
Spanish
Battery
had
placed
the
defenders
on
the
alert
,
and
although
the
British
were
suffering
so
heavily
on
account
of
their
minority
,
still
the
enemy
were
everywhere
feeling
the
effect
of
the
hot
and
unexpected
reception
.
 
<EOS>
Before
half
an
hour
had
passed
two
Russian
gunboats
had
been
torpedoed
,
and
the
French
cruiser
_
D'Estaing
_
,
having
caught
fire
,
was
burning
furiously
,
many
of
her
crew
perishing
at
their
guns
.

<EOS>
The
_
Lazare
Carnot
_
and
the
_
Massena
_
,
heedless
of
the
fire
from
the
shore
,
<EOS>
steamed
at
half
speed
across
the
estuary
until
they
were
opposite
the
Tynemouth
Battery
,
when
they
suddenly
opened
fire
,
being
quickly
joined
by
six
French
and
Russian
cruisers
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
contact
mines
were
being
blown
up
by
piquet
boats
,
who
,
although
suffering
heavily
from
the
fire
from
the
shore
,
nevertheless
continued
their
task
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
seen
how
utterly
inadequate
were
the
defences
of
the
Tyne
,
and
what
negligence
had
been
displayed
on
the
part
of
the
War
Office
in
not
providing
at
Tynemouth
adequate
means
of
warding
off
or
successfully
coping
with
an
attack
.
 
<EOS>
From
behind
the
tall
grey
lighthouse
a
few
guns
were
thundering
,
but
in
face
of
the
overwhelming
force
at
sea
it
was
but
a
sorry
attempt
.
<EOS>
One
shot
from
the
battery
severely
damaged
the
superstructure
of
the
_
Lazare
Carnot
_
,
another
cut
through
the
funnel
of
the
_
Neptune
_
,
carrying
it
away
,
and
a
third
entering
the
magazine
of
one
of
the
small
cruisers
caused
it
to
explode
with
serious
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
devastating
effect
of
the
enemy
's
shells
on
the
obsolete
defences
of
Tynemouth
was
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
Enclosed
in
the
fortifications
were
the
crumbling
ruins
of
the
ancient
Priory
,
with
its
restored
chapel
,
a
graveyard
,
and
an
old
Castle
that
had
been
converted
into
artillery
barracks
.
<EOS>
As
flame
and
smoke
rushed
continuously
from
the
barbettes
,
turrets
,
and
broadsides
of
the
hostile
ships
,
the
shots
brought
down
the
bare
,
dark
old
walls
of
the
Priory
,
and
,
crashing
into
the
Castle
,
played
havoc
with
the
building
.
<EOS>
The
lantern
of
the
lighthouse
,
too
,
was
carried
away
,
probably
by
a
shot
flying
accidentally
wide
,
and
every
moment
death
and
desolation
was
being
spread
throughout
the
fort
.
<EOS>
Such
a
magnificent
natural
position
,
commanding
as
it
did
the
whole
estuary
of
the
Tyne
,
should
have
been
rendered
impregnable
,
yet
,
as
it
remained
in
1894
,
so
it
stood
on
this
fatal
day
,
a
typical
example
of
War
Office
apathy
and
shortsightedness
.
 
<EOS>
Its
guns
were
a
mere
make
-
believe
,
that
gave
the
place
an
appearance
of
strength
that
it
did
not
possess
.
<EOS>
In
the
North
Battery
,
on
the
left
side
,
commanding
a
broad
sweep
of
sea
beyond
Sharpness
,
only
one
gun
,
a
64-pounder
,
was
mounted
,
the
remaining
five
rotting
platforms
being
unoccupied
!
<EOS>
At
the
extreme
point
,
to
command
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
a
single
5-tonner
was
placed
well
forward
with
great
ostentation
,
its
weight
,
calibre
,
and
other
details
having
been
painted
up
in
conspicuous
white
letters
,
for
the
delectation
of
an
admiring
public
<EOS>
admitted
to
view
the
Priory
.
<EOS>
The
South
Battery
,
a
trifle
stronger
,
was
,
nevertheless
,
a
sheer
burlesque
,
its
weakness
being
a
disgrace
to
the
British
nation
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
in
the
whole
of
the
battery
the
upper
defences
had
long
been
known
to
experts
to
be
obsolete
,
and
the
lower
ones
totally
inadequate
for
the
resistance
they
should
have
been
able
to
offer
.
 
<EOS>
Was
it
any
wonder
,
then
,
that
the
shells
of
the
enemy
should
cause
such
frightful
destruction
?
<EOS>
Among
the
British
artillerymen
there
was
no
lack
of
courage
,
for
they
exerted
every
muscle
in
their
gallant
efforts
to
repulse
the
foe
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
handicapped
as
they
were
by
lack
of
efficient
arms
and
properly
constructed
fortifications
,
their
heroic
struggles
were
futile
,
and
they
sacrificed
their
lives
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
deadly
hail
from
the
floating
monsters
swept
away
the
whole
of
the
ancient
Priory
walls
,
demolishing
the
old
red
brick
barracks
,
blowing
up
the
Castle
gateway
,
wrecking
the
guardroom
,
and
igniting
the
Priory
Chapel
.
<EOS>
The
loss
of
life
was
terrible
,
the
whole
of
the
men
manning
the
5-ton
gun
pointing
seaward
having
been
killed
by
a
single
shell
that
burst
among
them
,
while
everywhere
else
men
of
the
Royal
Artillery
,
and
those
of
the
Tynemouth
Volunteer
Artillery
,
who
were
assisting
,
were
killed
or
maimed
by
the
incessant
rain
of
projectiles
.
 
<EOS>
Night
clouds
gathered
black
and
threatening
,
and
it
appeared
as
if
the
enemy
were
carrying
all
before
them
.
<EOS>
The
French
battleship
_
Neptune
_
,
seeing
the
guns
of
all
three
batteries
had
been
considerably
weakened
,
was
steaming
slowly
into
the
mouth
of
the
Tyne
,
followed
by
the
Russian
cruiser
_
Syzran
_
,
when
suddenly
two
terrific
explosions
occurred
,
shaking
both
North
and
South
Shields
to
their
very
foundations
.
<EOS>
High
into
the
air
the
water
rose
,
and
it
was
then
seen
that
two
submarine
mines
had
been
exploded
simultaneously
by
electric
current
from
the
Tynemouth
Battery
,
and
that
both
vessels
had
been
completely
blown
up
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
force
of
the
explosion
,
that
the
hull
of
the
_
Neptune
_
,
a
great
armour
-
clad
of
over
ten
thousand
tons
,
had
been
ripped
up
like
paper
,
and
of
her
crew
scarcely
a
man
escaped
,
while
the
cruiser
had
been
completely
broken
in
half
,
and
many
of
her
crew
blown
to
atoms
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
this
success
of
the
defenders
been
realised
when
it
was
followed
by
another
,
for
a
second
later
a
British
torpedo
boat
succeeded
in
blowing
up
with
all
hands
<EOS>
the
French
torpedo
gunboat
_
Lance
_
.
 
<EOS>
These
reverses
,
however
,
caused
but
little
dismay
among
the
invaders
,
for
<EOS>
ere
long
the
British
cruisers
had
been
driven
off
,
the
guns
at
Trow
had
been
silenced
,
while
those
at
Spanish
Battery
and
Tynemouth
could
only
keep
up
a
desultory
fire
.
<EOS>
Then
,
in
the
falling
gloom
,
ship
after
ship
,
guided
by
foreign
pilots
,
and
carefully
evading
a
number
of
hulks
that
had
been
placed
near
the
estuary
,
entered
the
Tyne
,
pouring
forth
their
heavy
monotonous
fire
into
North
Shields
and
South
Shields
.
<EOS>
Skilfully
as
the
despairing
defenders
managed
their
submarine
mines
,
they
only
succeeded
in
destroying
three
more
of
the
enemy
's
ships
,
the
French
torpedo
gunboats
_
Iberville
_
and
_
Cassini
_
and
the
cruiser
<EOS>
_
Desaix
_
,
the
crews
perishing
.
 
<EOS>
Not
for
a
moment
was
there
a
cessation
of
the
cannonade
as
the
smaller
ships
of
the
enemy
advanced
up
the
river
,
and
the
damage
wrought
by
their
shells
was
enormous
.
<EOS>
Tynemouth
had
already
suffered
heavily
,
many
of
the
streets
being
in
flames
.
<EOS>
The
tower
of
St.
Saviour
's
Church
had
fallen
,
the
conspicuous
spire
of
the
Congregational
Chapel
had
been
shot
away
,
the
Piers
Office
had
been
reduced
to
ruins
,
and
the
long
building
of
the
Royal
Hotel
completely
wrecked
.
<EOS>
The
houses
facing
Percy
Park
had
in
many
cases
been
shattered
,
a
shell
exploding
under
the
archway
of
the
Bath
Hotel
had
demolished
it
,
and
the
handsome
clock
tower
at
the
end
of
the
road
had
been
hurled
down
and
scattered
.
 
<EOS>
Slackening
opposite
the
Scarp
,
the
gunboats
and
cruisers
belched
forth
shot
and
shell
upon
North
Shields
,
aiming
first
at
the
more
conspicuous
objects
,
such
as
the
Sailors
'
Home
,
the
Custom
House
,
the
tall
tower
of
Christ
Church
,
and
the
Harbour
Master
's
office
,
either
totally
destroying
them
or
injuring
them
irreparably
,
while
the
houses
on
Union
Quay
and
those
in
Dockway
Square
and
in
adjoining
streets
,
from
the
gasometers
down
to
the
Town
Hall
,
were
also
swept
by
shells
.
<EOS>
Resistance
was
made
from
Fort
Clifford
on
the
one
side
of
the
town
,
from
a
position
occupied
by
a
battery
of
the
Durham

who
had
mounted
guns
on
the
hill
behind
Smith

Yard
,
and
also
by
the
submarine
mines
of
the
Tyne
Division
Volunteer
Miners

but
it
was
most
ineffectual

and
,
when
night
fell
,
hundreds
of
terror
-
stricken
persons
had
been
killed

and
the
town
was
on
fire

the
flames
illuminating
the

lurid
brilliancy

In
South

tragic
scenes
were
being
enacted
.
<EOS>
Shells
flying
about
the
town
from
the
river
on
the
one
side
and
the
sea
on
the
other
exploded
in
the
streets
,
blowing
unfortunate
men
,
women
,
and
children
into
atoms
,
wrecking
public
buildings
,
and
setting
fire
to
the
cherished
homes
of
the
toilers
.
<EOS>
The
congested
blocks
of
buildings
around
Panash
Point
were
one
huge
furnace
;
the
Custom
House
,
the
River
Police
Station
,
and
the
Plate

were
wrecked
,
while
a
shell
exploding
in
one
of
the
petroleum
tanks
on
the
Commissioners
'
Wharf
<EOS>
caused
it
to
burst
with
fearful
effect
.
<EOS>
The
queer
old
turret
of
St.

fell
with
a
crash
,
the
Church
of
St.

was
practically
demolished
,
and
the

vicinity
unroofed

<EOS>
The

a

As
evening

came
slowly
up
the
Tyne
,
heedless
of
the
strenuous
opposition
with
which
they
were
met
by
Volunteer
Artillery

who

having
established

poured

sought
refuge
in

so
escaped

hundreds
lost
their

to
atoms
the
French
gunboat
_
Gabes
_
,
and
at
the
same
time
seriously
injured
the
propeller
of
the
cruiser
_
Cosamo
_
.
<EOS>
This
vessel
subsequently
broke
down
,
and
a
second
mine
fired
from
the
shore
destroyed
her
also
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
invaders
steadily
advanced
up
the
broad
river
,
blowing
up
obstacles
,
dealing
decisive
blows
,
and
destroying
human
life
and
valuable
property
with
every
shot
from
their
merciless
weapons
.
 
<EOS>
The
panic
that
night
in
Newcastle
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
The
streets
were
in
a
turmoil
of
excitement
,
for
the
reports
from
Tynemouth
had
produced
the
most
intense
alarm
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
the
first
intelligence
the
Free
Library
Committee
of
the
City
Council
happened
to
be
sitting
,
and
the
chairman
,
Alderman
H.
W.
Newton
,
the
popular
representative
of
All
Saints
'
North
,
formally
announced
it
to
his
colleagues
,
among
whom
was
the
Mayor
.
<EOS>
The
committee
broke
up
in
confusion
,
and
an
excited
consultation
followed
,
in
which
Councillors
Durnford
,
Fitzgerald
,
and
Flowers
,
with
Alderman
Sutton
,
took
part
.
<EOS>
Capt

<EOS>
Nicholls
,
the
Chief
Constable
,
Major
A.
M.
Potter
of
the
1st
Northumberland
Artillery
,
<EOS>
Lieut.-Col
.
<EOS>
Angus
of
the
1st
Newcastle
Volunteer
Artillery
,
Lieut.-Col
.
<EOS>
Palmer
and
Major
Emley
of
the
Volunteer
Engineers
,
Mr.
Hill
Motum
,
and
Mr.
Joseph
Cowen
also
entered
the
room
and
engaged
in
the
discussion
.
 
<EOS>
At
such
a
hasty
informal
meeting
,
nothing
,
however
,
could
be
done
.
<EOS>
The
Mayor
and
Councillors
were
assured
by
the
Volunteer
officers
that
everything
possible
under
the
circumstances
had
been
arranged
for
the
defence
of
the
Tyne
.
<EOS>
Property
worth
millions
was
at
stake
,
and
now
that
the
news
had
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
the
streets
around
the
Town
Hall
were
filled
with
crowds
of
excited
,
breathless
citizens
,
anxious
to
know
what
steps
were
being
taken
to
insure
their
protection
.
 
<EOS>
So
loudly
did
they
demand
information
,
that
the
Mayor
was
compelled
to
appear
for
a
moment
and
address
a
few
words
to
them
,
assuring
them
that
arrangements
had
been
made
which
he
hoped
would
be
found
adequate
to
repel
the
foe
.
<EOS>
This
appeased
them
in
a
measure
,
and
the
crowd
dispersed
;
but
in
the
other
thoroughfares
the
excitement
was
intensified
,
and
famished
thousands
rushed
aimlessly
about
,
many
going
out
upon
the
High
Level
and
Low
Level
Bridges
and
straining
their
eyes
down
the
river
in
endeavour
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Heavy
and
continuous
firing
could
be
heard
as
the
dark
evening
dragged
on
,
and
presently
,
just
before
nine
o'clock
,
the
anxious
ones
upon
the
bridges
saw
the
flash
of
guns
as
the
invading
vessels
rounded
the
sharp
bend
of
the
river
at
the
ferry
beyond
Rotterdam
Wharf
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
caused
the
people
to
rush
panic
-
stricken
up
into
the
higher
parts
of
Newcastle
or
across
the
bridges
into
Gateshead
,
and
from
both
towns
a
rapid
exodus
was
taking
place
,
thousands
fleeing
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
From
gun
-
vessels
,
torpedo
gunboats
,
and
cruisers
,
shot
and
shell
poured
in
continuous
streams
into
the
wharves
,
shipping
,
and
congested
masses
of
houses
on
either
bank
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
along
City
Road
,
St.
Lawrence
Road
,
Quality
Row
,
and
Byker
Bank
,
on
the
outskirts
of
Newcastle
,
suffered
severely
,
while
shots
damaged
the
great
Ouseburn
Viaduct
,
wrecked
St.
Dominic
's
Roman
Catholic
Chapel
,
and
blew
away
the
roof
of
the
new
Board
School
,
a
prominent
feature
of
the
landscape
.
 
<EOS>
Several
shells
fell
and
exploded
in
Jesmond
Vale
.
<EOS>
One
burst
and
set
fire
to
the
Sandyford
Brewery
,
and
one
or
two
falling
in
Portland
Road
caused
widespread
destruction
and
terrible
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
The
London
and
Hamburg
Wharves
,
with
the
shipping
lying
near
,
were
soon
blazing
furiously
,
and
all
along
Quay
Side
,
right
up
to
the
Guildhall
,
shops
and
offices
were
every
moment
being
destroyed
and
swept
away
.
<EOS>
New
Greenwich
and
South
Shore
on
the
Gateshead
side
were
vigorously
attacked
,
and
many
shots
fired
over
the
Salt
Marshes
fell
in
the
narrow
thoroughfares
that
lie
between
Sunderland
Road
and
Brunswick
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
enemy
's
ships
the
Volunteer
batteries
on
the
commanding
positions
on
either
side
of
the
high
banks
poured
a
galling
fire
,
one
battery
at
the
foot
of
the
Swing
Bridge
on
the
Gateshead
side
effecting
terrible
execution
.
<EOS>
Their
guns
had
been
well
laid
,
and
the
salvoes
of
shell
played
about
the
French
gun
-
vessels
and
torpedo
boats
,
causing
frightful
destruction
among
the
crews
.
<EOS>
Both
Newcastle
and
Gateshead
,
lying
so
much
higher
than
the
river
,
were
in
a
certain
measure
protected
,
and
the
high
banks
afforded
a
wide
command
over
the
waterway
.
<EOS>
At
various
points
,
including
the
entrances
to
the
High
Level
Bridge
,
at
the
Side
,
the
Close
,
New
Chatham
,
and
the
Rabbit
Banks
,
the
Volunteers
had
opened
fire
,
and
were
keeping
up
a
terrible
cannonade
.
<EOS>
The
dark
river
reflected
the
red
light
which
flashed
forth
every
moment
from
gun
muzzles
,
while
search
-
lights
from
both
ships
and
shore
were
constantly
streaming
forth
,
and
the
thunder
of
war
shook
the
tall
factory
chimneys
to
their
very
foundations
.
 
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
strenuous
opposition
,
the
invading
ships
kept
up
a
vigorous
fire
,
which
,
aimed
high
,
fell
in
the
centre
of
Newcastle
with
most
appalling
effect
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
crowds
in
Newgate
and
Pilgrim
Streets
shells
exploded
,
blowing
dozens
of
British
citizens
to
atoms
and
tearing
out
the
fronts
of
shops
.
<EOS>
One
projectile
,
aimed
at
the
strangely
shaped
tower
of
St.
Nicholas
'
Cathedral
,
struck
it
,
and
swept
away
the
thin
upper
portion
,
and
another
,
crashing
into
the
sloping
roof
of
the
grim
,
time
-
mellowed
relic
Black
Gate
,
shattered
it
,
and
tore
away
part
of
the
walls
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
castle
and
the
railway
bridge
were
also
blown
up
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
bombardment
,
and
the
square
tower
of
St.
John
's
fell
with
a
sudden
crash
right
across
the
street
,
completely
blocking
it
.
<EOS>
From
end
to
end
Grainger
Street
was
swept
by
French
melinite
shells
,
which
,
bursting
in
rapid
succession
,
filled
the
air
with
tiny
flying
fragments
,
each
as
fatal
as
a
bullet
fired
from
a
rifle
.
<EOS>
The
French
shell
is
much
more
formidable
than
ours
,
for
,
while
the
latter
breaks
into
large
pieces
,
the
former
is
broken
up
into
tiny
and
exceedingly
destructive
fragments
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
terrible
panic
a
shot
cut
its
way
through
the
Earl
Grey
Monument
,
causing
it
to
fall
,
many
persons
being
crushed
to
death
beneath
the
stones
,
while
both
the
Central
Exchange
and
the
Theatre
Royal
were
now
alight
,
shedding
a
brilliant
glare
skyward
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
too
,
the
whole
of
Quay
Side
was
a
mass
of
roaring
,
crackling
flames
,
the
thin
spire
of
St.
Mary
's
Roman
Catholic
Cathedral
had
been
shot
away
,
Bainbridge
's
great
emporium
was
blazing
furiously
,
and
the
Art
Club
premises
had
taken
fire
.
<EOS>
One
shot
had
fallen
at
the
back
of
the
Town
Hall
,
and
torn
an
enormous
hole
in
the
wall
,
while
another
,
entering
the
first
floor
of
the
County
Hotel
,
had
burst
with
awful
force
,
and
carried
away
the
greater
part
of
its
gloomy
facade
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Central
Station
opposite
,
dozens
of
shells
had
exploded
,
and
it
was
now
on
fire
,
hopelessly
involved
together
with
the
adjoining
Station
Hotel
.
<EOS>
The
grey
front
of
the
imposing
<EOS>
_
Chronicle
_
building
had
been
wrecked
by
a
shell
that
had
descended
upon
the
roof
,
and
a
row
of
dark
old
-
fashioned
houses
in
Eldon
Square
had
been
demolished
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
fate
had
been
shared
by
the
Co
-
operative
Wholesale
Society
's
warehouse
,
the
Fish
Market
,
the
_
Journal
_
office
,
and
both
the
Crown
and
Metropole
Hotels
at
the
bottom
of
Clayton
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
the
firing
continued
;
the
terrified
citizens
were
granted
no
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
Royal
Arcade
was
blown
to
atoms
,
the
new
red
brick
buildings
of
the
Prudential
Assurance
Company
were
set
on
fire
,
and
were
blazing
with
increasing
fury
.
<EOS>
The
building
of
the
North
British
and
Mercantile
Assurance
Company
,
the
Savings
Bank
at
the
corner
of
Newgate
Street
,
and
the
Empire
Theatre
were
wrecked
.
<EOS>
Along
New
Bridge
Street
dozens
of
houses
were
blown
to
pieces
,
several
fine
residences
in
Ellison
Place
were
utterly
demolished
and
blocked
the
roadway
with
their
debris
,
and
the
whole
city
,
from
the
river
up
to
Brandling
Village
,
was
swept
time
after
time
by
salvoes
of
devastating
shots
.
<EOS>
Rows
of
houses
fell
,
and
in
hundreds
the
terrified
people
were
massacred
.
<EOS>
Away
over
the
Nun
's
Moor
shells
were
hurled
and
burst
,
and
others
were
precipitated
into
the
great
Armstrong
works
at
Elswick
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
in
the
midst
of
the
incessant
thunder
,
a
series
of
terrific
explosions
occurred
,
and
the
great
High
Level
Bridge
collapsed
,
and
fell
with
an
awful
crash
into
the
Tyne
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
placed
dynamite
under
the
huge
brick
supports
,
and
blown
them
up
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
the
Swing
Bridge
was
treated
in
similar
manner
;
but
the
enemy
,
under
the
galling
fire
from
the
Volunteer
batteries
,
were
now
losing
frightfully
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
new
guns
at
the
Elswick
works
were
brought
into
action
,
and
several
ironclads
in
the
course
of
construction
afforded
cover
to
those
desperately
defending
their
homes
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
blow
of
the
invaders
had
been
struck
at
a
most
inopportune
moment
,
and
was
evidently
the
result
of
an
order
that
had
been
imperfectly
understood
.
<EOS>
It
caused
them
to
suffer
a
greater
disaster
than
they
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Six
torpedo
boats
and
two
gun
-
vessels
had
passed
under
the
bridge
,
and
,
lying
off
the
Haughs
,
were
firing
into
the
Elswick
works
at
the
moment
when
the
bridges
were
demolished
,
and
the
debris
,
falling
across
the
stream
,
cut
off
all
means
of
escape
.

<EOS>
The
defenders
,
noticing
this
,
worked
on
,
pounding
away
at
the
hostile
craft
with
merciless
monotony
,
until
one
after
another
the
French
and
Russians
were
blown
to
atoms
,
and
their
vessels
sank
beneath
them
into
the
dark
,
swirling
waters
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
proceeding
,
two
mines
,
one
opposite
Hill
Gate
,
at
Gateshead
,
and
the
other
near
the
Rotterdam
Wharf
,
on
the
Newcastle
side
,
were
fired
by
the
Volunteer
Engineers
,
who
thus
succeeded
in
blowing
up
two
more
French
gunboats
,
while
the
battery
at
the
foot
of
the
Swing
Bridge
sank
two
more
torpedo
boats
,
and
that
in
front
of
the
Chemical
Works
at
Gateshead
sent
a
shell
into
the
"
vitals
"
of
one
of
the
most
powerful
torpedo
gunboats
,
with
the
result
that
she
blew
up
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
enemy
were
being
cut
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
Seeing
the
trap
into
which
their
vessels
had
fallen
above
the
ruined
bridges
,
and
feeling
that
they
had
caused
sufficient
damage
,
they
turned
,
and
with
their
guns
still
belching
forth
flame
,
steamed
at
half
speed
back
again
towards
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
allowed
to
escape
so
easily
,
for
the
mines
recently
laid
by
the
Volunteers
were
now
brought
into
vigorous
play
,
and
in
the
long
reach
of
the
river
between
High
Walker
and
Wallsend
no
fewer
than
six
more
of
the
enemy
's
gun
and
torpedo
boats
had
their
bottoms
blown
out
,
and
their
crews
torn
limb
from
limb
.
 
<EOS>
Flashed
throughout
the
land
,
the
news
of
the
enemy
's
repulse
,
though
gained
at
such
enormous
loss
,
excited
a
feeling
of
profound
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
The
injury
inflicted
on
the
invaders
had
been
terrible
,
and
from
that
attack
upon
the
Tyne
they
had
been
hurled
reeling
back
the
poorer
by
the
loss
of
a
whole
fleet
of
torpedo
and
gun
boats
,
one
of
the
most
effective
arms
of
their
squadrons
,
while
the
sea
had
closed
over
one
of
France
's
proudest
battleships
,
the
_
Neptune
_
,
and
no
fewer
than
four
of
her
cruisers
.
 
<EOS>
The
surviving
vessels
,
which
retreated
round
the
Black
Middens
and
gained
the
open
sea
,
all
more
or
less
had
their
engines
crippled
,
and
not
half
the
men
that
had
manned
them
escaped
alive
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
wrought
incalculable
damage
,
it
is
true
,
for
part
of
Newcastle
was
burning
,
and
the
loss
of
life
had
been
terrible
;
yet
they
were
driven
back
by
the
Volunteers
'
desperately
vigorous
fire
,
and
the
lives
of
many
thousands
in
Newcastle
and
Gateshead
had
thus
been
saved
at
the
eleventh
hour
by
British
patriots
.

Alas

it
was
a
black
day
in
England

history

Was
this
to
be
a

suddenly

<EOS>
Days
passed
--
dark
,
dismal
,
dispiriting
.
<EOS>
Grim
-
visaged
War
had
crushed
all
joy
and
gaiety
from
British
hearts
,
and
fierce
patriotism
and
determination
to
fight
on
until
the
bitter
end
mingled
everywhere
with
hunger
,
sadness
,
and
despair
.
<EOS>
British
homes
had
been
desecrated
,
British
lives
had
been
sacrificed
,
and
through
the
land
the
invaders
rushed
ravaging
with
fire
and
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Whole
towns
had
been
overwhelmed
and
shattered
,
great
tracts
of
rich
land
in
Sussex
and
Hampshire
had
been
laid
waste
,
and
the
people
,
powerless
against
the
enormous
forces
sweeping
down
upon
them
,
had
been
mercilessly
mowed
down
and
butchered
by
Cossacks
,
whose
brutality
was
fiendish
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
there
were
reports
of
horrible
atrocities
,
of
heartless
murders
,
and
wholesale
slaughter
of
the
helpless
and
unoffending
.
 
<EOS>
The
situation
,
both
in
Great
Britain
and
on
the
Continent
,
was
most
critical
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
declaration
of
hostilities
by
France
and
Russia
had
resulted
in
a
great
war
in
which
nearly
all
European
nations
were
involved
.
<EOS>
Germany
had
sent
her
enormous
land
forces
over
her
frontiers
east
and
west
,
successfully
driving
back
the
French
along
the
Vosges
,
and
occupying
Dijon
,
Chalons
-
sur
-
Saone
,
and
Lyons
.
<EOS>
Valmy
,
Nancy
,
and
Metz
had
again
been

In
Poland
,
however
,
neither
Germans
nor
Austrians
had
met
with
such
success
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
battle
had
been
fought
at
Thorn
between
the
Tsar
's
forces
and
the
Germans
,
and
the
former
,
after
a
desperate
stand
,
were
defeated
,
and
the
Uhlans
,
dragoons
,
and
infantry
of
the
Fatherland
had
swept
onward
up
the
valley
of
the
Vistula
to
Warsaw
.
<EOS>
Here
the
resistance
offered
by
General
Bodisco
was
very
formidable
,
but
the
city
was
besieged
,
while
fierce
fighting
was
taking
place
all
across
the
level
country
that
lay
between
the
Polish
capital
and
the
Prussian
frontier
.
<EOS>
Austrians
and
Hungarians
fought
fiercely
,
the
Tyrolese
Jaegers
displaying
conspicuous
bravery
at
Brody
,
Cracow
,
Jaroslav
,
and
along
the
banks
of
the
San
,
and
they
had
succeeded
up
to
the
present
in
preventing
the
Cossacks
and
Russian
infantry
from
reaching
the
Carpathians
,
although
an
Austrian
army
corps
advancing
into
Russia
along
the
Styr
had
been
severely
cut
up
and
forced
to
retreat
back
to

<EOS>
Italy
had
burst
her
bonds
.
<EOS>
Her
Bersaglieri
,
cuirassiers
,
Piedmontese
cavalry
,
and
carabiniers
had
marched
along
the
Corniche
road
into
Provence
,
and
,
having
occupied
Nice
,
Cannes
,
and
Draguigan
,
were
on
their
way
to
attack
Marseilles
,
while
the
Alpine
infantry
,
taking
the
road
over
Mont
Cenis
,
had
,
after
very
severe
fighting
in
the
beautiful
valley
between
Susa
and
Bardonnechia
,
at
last
occupied
Modane
and
Chambery
,
and
now
intended
joining
hands
with
the
Germans
at
Lyons
.
 
<EOS>
France
was
now
receiving
greater
punishment
than
she
had
anticipated
,
and
even
those
members
of
the
Cabinet
and
Deputies
who
were
responsible
for
the
sudden
invasion
of
England
were
compelled
to
admit
that
they
had
made
a
false
move
.
<EOS>
The
frontiers
were
being
ravaged
,
and
although
the
territorial
regiments
remaining
were
considered
sufficient
to
repel
attack
,
yet
the
Army
of
the
Saone
had
already
been
cut
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
In
these
circumstances
,
France
,
knowing
the
great
peril
she
ran
in
prolonging
the
invasion
of
Britain
,
was
desperately
anxious
to
make
the
British
sue
for
peace
,
so
that
she
could
turn
her
attention
to
events
at
home
,
and
therefore
,
although
in
a
measure
contravening
International
Law
,
she
had
instructed
her
Admirals
to
bombard
British
seaports
and
partially
-
defended
towns
.
 
<EOS>
Although
the
guns
of
the
hostile
fleet
had
wrought
such
appalling
havoc
on
the
Humber
,
on
the
Tyne
,
and
along
the
coast
of
Kent
and
Sussex
,
nevertheless
the
enemy
had
only
secured
a
qualified
success
.
<EOS>
The
cause
of
all
the
disasters
that
had
befallen
us
,
of
the
many
catastrophes
on
land
and
sea
,
was
due
to
the
wretchedly
inadequate
state
of
our
Navy
,
although
the
seven
new
battleships
and
six
cruisers
commenced
in
1894
were
now
complete
and
afloat
.
 
<EOS>
Had
we
possessed
an
efficient
Navy
the
enemy
could
never
have
approached
our
shores
.
<EOS>
We
had
not
a
sufficient
number
of
ships
to
replace
casualties
.
<EOS>
Years
behind
in
nearly
every
essential
point
,
Britain
had
failed
to
give
her
cruisers
either
speed
or
guns
equal
in
strength
to
those
of
other
nations
.
<EOS>
Our
guns
were
the
worst
in
the
world
,
no
fewer
than
47
vessels
still
mounting
350
old
muzzleloaders
,
weapons
discarded
by
every
other
European
Navy
.
 
<EOS>
For
years
it
had
been
a
race
between
the
hare
and
the
tortoise
.
<EOS>
We
had
remained
in
dreamy
unconsciousness
of
danger
,
while
other
nations
had
quickly
taken
advantage
of
all
the
newly
-
discovered
modes
of
destruction
that
make
modern
warfare
so
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
odds
against
us
in
nearly
every
particular
,
the
British
losses
had
been
nothing
as
compared
with
those
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
This
spoke
much
for
British
pluck
and
pertinacity
.
<EOS>
With
a
force
against
them
of
treble
their
strength
,
British
bluejackets
had
succeeded
in
sinking
a
number
of
the
finest
and
most
powerful
ships
of
France
and
Russia
.
<EOS>
France
had
lost
the
_

The
losses
the

had
sustained

in

included

The

this
enormous
force
had
,
of
course
,
not
been
effected
without
an
infliction
of
loss
upon
the
defenders

the
British

bore
no

those

<EOS>
True

the

had
,
alas

been
sacrificed

the
fine

gone

performed
heroic
deeds
worthy

what

Still
the

were
striking
swift

terrible

On

the
loss

had
been
appalling

The
bombardment
of
Brighton
,
the
sack
of
Eastbourne
,
and
the
occupation
of
the
Downs
by
the

had
been
effected
only
by
wholesale
rapine
and
awful
bloodshed
,
and
Britain
waited
breathlessly
,
wondering
in
what
direction
the
next
catastrophe
would
occur
.
 
<EOS>
Such

In

Special

were
being

Washington
for
the
purpose

discussing
the
advisability

influential

waited
upon

all
the

were
interviewed
by
the

New

the

showing
a
great
preponderance
of
feeling

taken

In
British
colonies
throughout

the

most
intense
excitement
prevailed

Already
bodies

From

embarked

the
Northern

had
been
strengthened
in
anticipation
of
a
movement
south
by

the
French

Pondichery

An

with
the

of
the
British

on
the
China
Station
had
,
after
hard
fighting

occupied
a
portion
of
the

,
while
part
of
the

had
gone
farther
south
and
commenced
operations
in
French
Cochin

China
by
a
vigorous
attack
on

Armed

On

intense
patriotism
spread
through
Canada

and
from
the
shores
of
Lake

away
to

Vancouver
<EOS>
a

was
at

In
Quebec

Montreal

mass
meetings
were
held
,
urging
the
Dominion
Government
to
allow
a
force
of
Volunteers
to
go
to
England
without
delay
;
and
this
universal
demand
was
the
more
gratifying
when
it
was
remembered
that
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
population
were
themselves
French

<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
knowledge
that
Britain
was
in
danger
was
sufficient
to
arouse
patriotism
everywhere
,
and
within
a
few
days
20,000
Volunteers
were
enrolled
,
and
these
,
before
a
fortnight
had
passed
,
were
on
their

Great

a

days
later
,
to
the
strains

the
first

landed

as

marched
through

the
people

delighted
at
this
practical
demonstration
of
sympathy

wrung
the

Vessel

vessel

escorted

arrived

discharged
their
regiments

men
to
whom
the
knowledge
of
Britain

danger
had
been
sufficient
incentive
to
induce
them
to
act
their

Then

when
the
last

had
arrived

they
were
formed

Melbourne

Then

Crowds

with

demanding

Although

Day

the

kept
paying

The

the

the
eager

those
feverishly
anxious

fearing

formed

As

close

Many

banks

high

that
the
very
fact
of
being
a
depositor
was
a
hall
-
mark
of
a
man

prosperity

while
others
were
minor

was
mainly
with
small

One

In
the
West
End
the
starving
poor
had
formed
processions

and
marched
through
Mayfair
and
Belgravia
demanding
bread

while
Anarchists
held
council
in
front

heedless

powerless

If

A

then
forced
an
entry
to
the
wine
vaults
at

and
swallowed
priceless
vintages
from
pewter

Hogsheads

rabble

<EOS>
Murder
and
incendiarism
were
committed
in
every
quarter
,
and
many
serious
and
desperate
conflicts
occurred
between
the
rioters
and
the
law
-
abiding
patriotic
citizens
.
 
<EOS>
Enthusiasm
was
displayed
by
even
the
latter
,
when
an
infuriated
mob
one
night
surrounded
Albert
Gate
House
,
the
French
Embassy
,
and
,
breaking
open
the
door
,
entered
it
,
and
flung
the
handsome
furniture
from
the
windows
.
 
<EOS>
Those
below
made
a
huge
pile
in
the
street
,
and
when
the
whole
of
the
movable
effects
had
been
got
out
,
the
crowd
set
fire
to
them
,
and
also
to
the
great
mansion
,
at
the
same
time
cheering
lustily
,
and
singing
"
Rule
,
Britannia
,
"
as
they
watched
the
flames
leap
up
and
consume
both
house
and
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
The
servants
of
the
Embassy
had
fortunately
escaped
,
otherwise
they
would
no
doubt
have
fared
badly
at
the
hands
of
the
lawless
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
fire
had
burned
itself
out
,
however
,
a
suggestion
was
spread
,
and
the
mob
with
one
accord
rushed
to
the
Russian
Embassy
in
Chesham
Place
.
 
<EOS>
This
house
was
also
entered
,
and
the
furniture
flung
pell
-
mell
from
the
windows
,
that
too
large
to
pass
through
being
broken
up
in
the
rooms
,
and
the
fragments
thrown
to
the
shouting
crowd
below
.
 
<EOS>
Chairs
,
tables
,
ornaments
,
mirrors
,
bedding
,
kitchen
utensils
,
and
crockery
were
thrown
out
,
carpets
were
taken
up
,
and
curtains
and
cornices
torn
down
by
ruthless
denizens
of
Whitechapel
and
Shoreditch
,
who
,
maddened
by
drink
,
were
determined
to
destroy
everything
belonging
to
the
countries
which
had
brought
disaster
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
,
when
nearly
all
the
furniture
had
been
removed
,
some
man
,
wild
-
haired
and
excited
,
emerged
into
the
street
,
with
a
great
flag
he
had
discovered
in
one
of
the
attics
.
<EOS>
With
a
shout
of
delight
he
unfurled
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
large
yellow
one
,
upon
which
was
depicted
a
huge
black
double
eagle
;
the
flag
that
had
been
hoisted
at
the
Embassy
on
various
State
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
Its
appearance
was
greeted
by
a
fearful
howl
of
rage
,
and
the
infuriated
people
,
falling
upon
the
man
who
waved
it
,
tore
it
into
shreds
,
which
they
afterwards
cast
into
the
bonfire
they
had
made
for
the
Ambassador
's
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
archives
the
secret
papers
and
reports
of
spies
were
taken
,
and
,
being
torn
into
fragments
,
were
scattered
from
an
upper
window
to
the
winds
,
until
at
last
,
men
,
snatching
up
flaring
brands
from
the
huge
bonfire
,
rushed
into
the
dismantled
mansion
,
and
,
having
poured
petroleum
in
many
of
the
apartments
,
ignited
them
.
 
<EOS>
Flames
quickly
spread
through
the
house
,
belching
forth
from
the
windows
,
and
,
ascending
,
had
soon
burst
through
the
roof
,
illuminating
the
neighbourhood
with
a
bright
,
fitful
glare
.
<EOS>
The
mob
,
as
the
flames
leaped
up
and
crackled
,
screamed
with
fiendish
delight
.
<EOS>
From
thousands
of
hoarse
throats
there
went
up
loud
cries
of
"
Down
with
the
Tsar
!
<EOS>
Down
with
Russia
!
"
<EOS>
And
as
the
great
bonfire
died
down
,
and
the
roof
of
the
Embassy
collapsed
with
a
crash
,
causing
the
flames
to
shoot
higher
and
roar
more
vigorously
,
they
sang
with
one
accord
,
led
by
a
man
who
had
mounted
some
railings
,
the
stirring
British
song
,
"
The
Union
Jack
of
Old
England
.
"
 
<EOS>
Although
the
colonies
had
shown
how
zealously
they
were
prepared
to
guard
the
interests
of
the
Mother
Country
,
their
public
spirit
was
eclipsed
by
the
spontaneous
outburst
of
patriotism
which
occurred
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
Mass
meetings
were
being
held
in
Belfast
,
Dublin
,
Cork
,
Waterford
,
Limerick
,
Londonderry
,
Sligo
,
Armagh
,
Dundalk
,
Newry
,
and
dozens
of
other
places
,
at
which
men
of
all
grades
of
society
unanimously
decided
by
resolution
to
raise
Volunteer
regiments
to
take
arms
against
the
foe
.
 
<EOS>
The
knowledge
of
Britain
's
danger
had
aroused
the
patriotic
feelings
of
the
people
,
and
they
were
determined
to
give
their
sovereign
a
proof
of
their
allegiance
,
cost
what
it
might
.
 
<EOS>
The
movement
was
a
general
one
.
<EOS>
Nationalists
and
Unionists
vied
in
their
eagerness
to
demonstrate
their
love
for
the
Empire
,
and
that
part
of
it
which
was
now
in
danger
.
 
<EOS>
Already
the
Irish
Reserve
forces
had
been
mobilised
and
sent
to
their
allotted
stations
.
<EOS>
The
3rd
Irish
Rifles
from
Newtownards
,
the
5th
Battalion
from
Downpatrick
,
and
the
6th
from
Dundalk
,
were
at
Belfast
under
arms
;
the
Donegal
Artillery
from
Letterkenny
had
already
gone
to
Harwich
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
the
east
coast
;
and
both
the
Londonderry
and
Sligo
Artillery
had
gone
to
Portsmouth
;
while
the
3rd
Irish
Fusiliers
from
Armagh
were
at
Plymouth
,
and
the
4th
Battalion
from
Cavan
had
left
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
the
Severn
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
differences
of
political
opinion
had
previously
existed
between
them
on
the
question
of
Home
Rule
,
were
forgotten
by
the
people
in
the
face
of
the
great
danger
which
threatened
the
Empire
to
which
they
belonged
.
<EOS>
The
national
peril
welded
the
people
together
,
and
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
marched
to
lay
down
their
lives
,
if
necessary
,
in
the
work
of
driving
back
the
invader
.
 
<EOS>
Within
six
days
of
this
spontaneous
outburst
of
patriotism
,
25,000
Irishmen
of
all
creeds
and
political
opinions
were
on
their
way
to
assist
their
English
comrades
.
<EOS>
As
might
have
been
expected
,
the
greater
number
of
these
Volunteers
came
from
the
North
of
Ireland
,
but
every
district
sent
its
sons
,
eager
to
take
part
in
the
great
struggle
.
<EOS>
At
the
great
meetings
held
at
Dublin
,
Belfast
,
Cork
,
Limerick
,
Wexford
,
Waterford
,
Strabane
,
Newtown
-
Stewart
,
Downpatrick
,
Ballymena
,
and
dozens
of
other
places
all
over
the
country
,
from
the
Giant
's
Causeway
to
Cape
Clear
,
and
from
Dublin
to
Galway
Bay
,
the
most
intense
enthusiasm
was
shown
,
and
men
signed
their
names
to
the
roll
in
hundreds
,
many
subscribing
large
sums
to
defray
the
cost
of
equipment
and
other
expenses
.
<EOS>
Each
passenger
or
mail
boat
from
Larne
to
Stranraer
,
from
Dublin
to
Holyhead
,
every
steamer
from
Belfast
to
Whitehaven
and
Liverpool
,
brought
over
well
-
armed
contingents
of
stalwart
men
,
who
,
after
receiving
hearty
receptions
of
the
most
enthusiastic
and
flattering
description
,
were
moved
south
to
Stamford
in
Lincolnshire
as
quickly
as
the
disorganised
railway
service
would
allow
.
 
<EOS>
The
object
of
the
military
authorities
in
concentrating
them
at
this
point
was
to
strengthen
the
great
force
of
defenders
now
marching
south
.
<EOS>
Detraining
at
Stamford
,
the
commanding
officer
had
orders
to
march
to
Oundle
,
by
way
of
King
's
Cliffe
and
Fotheringhay
,
and
there
remain
until
joined
by
a
brigade
of
infantry
with
the
Canadians
coming
from
Leicestershire
.
<EOS>
The
great
body
of
men
at
length
mustered
,
answered
the
roll
,
and
marched
through
the
quiet
old
-
world
streets
of
Stamford
,
and
out
upon
the
broad
highway
to
King
's
Cliffe
on
the
first
stage
of
their
journey
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
early
morning
.
<EOS>
In
the
sunlight
the
dew
still
glistened
like
diamonds
on
the
wayside
,
as
regiment
after
regiment
,
with
firm
,
steady
step
,
and
shouldering
their
rifles
,
bravely
passed
away
through
the
fields
of
ripe
uncut
corn
,
eager
to
unite
with
a
force
of
Regulars
,
and
strike
their
first
blow
for
their
country
's
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Sturdy
fishermen
from
the
rough
shores
of
Donegal
marched
side
by
side
with
townsmen
and
artisans
from
Dublin
,
Belfast
,
and
Limerick
;
<EOS>
sons
of
wealthy
manufacturers
in
Antrim
and
Down
bore
arms
with
stalwart
peasantry
from
Kerry
and
Tipperary
;
while
men
whose
poor
but
cherished
cabins
overlooked
Carlingford
Lough
,
united
with
fearless
patriots
from
Carlow
,
Wexford
,
and
Waterford
.
 
<EOS>
Since
they
landed
on
English
soil
,
they
had
met
with
a
boundless
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
rural
districts
the
distress
was
not
yet
so
great
as
in
the
larger
towns
;
consequently
at
King
's
Cliffe
,
when
the
first
detachment
halted
for
rest
in
the
long
straggling
street
of
the
typical
English
village
,
the
bells
of
the
quaint
old
church
were
rung
,
and
villagers
gave
their
defenders
bread
,
cheese
,
and
draughts
of
ale
.
<EOS>
While
the
men
were
standing
at
ease
and
eating
heartily
,
two
officers
entered
Bailey
's
,
the
village
grocery
store
,
which
served
as
post
office
,
and
received
a
cipher
telegraphic
despatch
.
<EOS>
They
emerged
into
the
roadway
immediately
,
and
their
faces
showed
that
some
unforeseen
event
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
A
third
officer
was
summoned
,
and
a
hurried
and
secret
consultation
took
place
as
they
stood
together
opposite
the
Cross
Keys
Inn
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
can
we
do
it
?
"
<EOS>
queried
the
youngest
of
the
trio
,
aloud
,
pulling
on
his
gloves
,
and
settling
the
hang
of
his
sword
.
 
<EOS>
The
grave
elder
man
,
commander
of
the
brigade
,
glanced
quickly
at
his
watch
,
with
knit
brows
.
 
<EOS>
"
Do
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
with
a
marked
Irish
accent
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
dash
for
life
;
but
the
boys
are
fresh
,
and
as
duty
calls
,
we
must
push
onward
,
even
though
we
may
be
marching
to
our
doom
.
<EOS>
Go
,
"
he
said
to
the
youngest
of
his
two
companions
,
"
tell
them
we
are
moving
,
and
that
our
advance
guard
will
reach
them
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
young
lieutenant
hurried
over
to
the
little
shop
,
and
as
he
did
so
the
colonel
gave
an
order
,
and
a
bugle
awoke
the
echoes
of
the
village
.
 
<EOS>
Quick
words
of
command
sounded
down
the
quaint
,
ancient
street
,
followed
by
the
sharp
click
of
arms
.
<EOS>
Again
officers
'
voices
sounded
loud
and
brief
,
and
at
the
word
"
March
!
"
<EOS>
the
great
body
of
stern
loyalists
moved
onward
over
the
bridge
,
and
up
the
School
Hill
on
to
the
long
winding
road
which
led
away
through
Apesthorpe
and
historic
Fotheringhay
to
Oundle
.
 
<EOS>
The
message
from
the
front
had
been
immediately
responded
to
,
for
a
few
minutes
later
the
excited
villagers
stood
watching
the
rearguard
disappearing
in
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
heavy
tread
of
the
thousand
feet
upon
the
white
highway
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
.
 
<EOS>
RUSSIAN
ADVANCE
IN
THE
MIDLANDS
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
land
the
grey
-
coated
hordes
of
the
White
Tsar
spread
like
locusts
--
their
track
marked
by
death
and
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
Both
French
and
Russian
troops
had
taken
up
carefully
selected
positions
on
the
Downs
,
and
,
backed
by
the
enormous
reinforcements
now
landed
,
were
slowly
advancing
.
<EOS>
Every
detail
of
the
surprise
invasion
had
apparently
been
carefully
considered
,
for
immediately
after
the
fierce
battle
off
Beachy
Head
a
number
of
French
and
Russian
cruisers
were
despatched
to
the
Channel
ports
in
order
to
threaten
them
,
so
as
to
prevent
many
of
the
troops
in
Hampshire
,
Dorset
,
and
Devon
from
moving
to
their
place
of
assembly
.
<EOS>
Consequently
large
bodies
of
British
troops
were
compelled
to
remain
inactive
,
awaiting
probable
local
attacks
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
invaders
lost
no
time
in
extending
their
flanks
preparatory
to
a
general
advance
,
and
very
quickly
they
were
in
possession
of
all
the
high
ground
from
Polegate
to
Steyning
Down
,
while
Cossack
patrols
were
out
on
the
roads
towards
Cuckfield
and
West
Grinstead
,
and
demonstrations
were
made
in
the
direction
of
Horsham
,
where
a
strong
force
of
British
troops
had
hastily
collected
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
long
hot
days
passed
,
the
Volunteers
forming
the
line
of
defence
south
of
London
had
not
been
idle
.
<EOS>
A
brigade
of
infantry
had
been
pushed
forward
to
Balcombe
,
and
with
this
the
British
were
now
watching
the
high
ground
that
stretched
across
to
Horsham
.
 
<EOS>
The
advance
of
the
enemy
had
not
,
of
course
,
been
accomplished
without
terrible
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
A
division
of
the
Regulars
from
Parkhurst
,
Portsmouth
,
and
Winchester
,
which
had
been
hurried
down
to
Arundel
to
occupy
a
strong
defensive
position
near
that
town
,
had
come
into
contact
with
the
enemy
,
and
some
desperate
fighting
ensued
.
<EOS>
Outposts
had
been
thrown
across
the
river
Arun
,
and
about
midnight
a
patrol
of
the
2nd
Cavalry
Brigade
from
Petersfield
,
supported
by
infantry
,
had
been
suddenly
attacked
close
to
Ashington
village
.
<EOS>
Under
a
vigorous
fire
they
were
unfortunately
compelled
to
fall
back
fighting
,
and
were
almost
annihilated
,
for
it
was
only
then
ascertained
that
the
enemy
were
moving
in
great
force
,
evidently
with
the
intention
of
obtaining
possession
of
the
heights
as
far
as
Cocking
,
West
Dean
,
and
Chichester
,
and
so
threaten
Portsmouth
from
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
The
survivors
of
this
cavalry
patrol
succeeded
in
recrossing
the
Arun
,
but
their
losses
were
exceedingly
heavy
.
 
<EOS>
At
daybreak
the
enemy
were
visible
from
Arundel
,
and
shot
and
shell
were
poured
into
them
from
the
batteries
established
along
the
hills
to
Houghton
.
<EOS>
So
heavy
was
the
British
fire
that
the
Russians
were
compelled
to
seek
cover
,
and
their
advance
in
this
direction
was
,
for
this
time
,
checked
.
 
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
although
occupying
an
excellent
position
,
were
,
however
,
not
sufficiently
strong
to
successfully
cope
with
the
onward
rush
of
invaders
,
and
could
do
little
else
beyond
watching
them
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
Russians
,
displaying
great
tactical
skill
,
and
led
by
men
who
had
thoroughly
studied
the
geography
of
the
South
of
England
,
had
gained
a
distinct
advantage
,
for
they
had
secured
their
left
flank
from
attack
,
so
that
they
could
now
advance
northward
to
Horsham
and
Balcombe
practically
unmolested
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
general
movement
commenced
at
noon
,
when
an
advance
was
made
by
two
enormous
columns
of
the
enemy
,
one
of
which
proceeded
by
way
of
Henfield
and
Partridge
Green
and
the
other
by
Cooksbridge
and
Keynes
,
the
third
column
remaining
in
Sussex
to
protect
the
base
of
operations
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Horsham
had
been
occupied
by
a
portion
of
the
2nd
division
of
the
1st
Army
Corps
with
a
12-pounder
,
a
9-pounder
field
battery
,
and
a
field
company
of
the
Royal
Engineers
,
and
had
been
placed
in
a
state
of
hasty
defence
.
<EOS>
Walls
had
been
loopholed
,
fences
had
been
cut
down
,
and
various
preparations
made
for
holding
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
Our
forces
were
,
nevertheless
,
sadly
lacking
in
numbers
.
<EOS>
A
cavalry
patrol
of
one
of
our
flying
columns
was
captured
by
Cossacks
at
Cowfold
,
and
the
neglect
on
the
part
of
the
commander
of
this
column
to
send
out
his
advance
guard
sufficiently
far
,
resulted
in
it
being
hurled
back
upon
the
main
body
in
great
disorder
.
<EOS>
Then
,
seeing
the
success
everywhere
attending
their
operations
,
the
invaders
turned
their
attention
to
the
British
line
of
communication
between
Horsham
and
Arundel
,
and
succeeded
in
breaking
it
at
Billinghurst
and
at
Petworth
.
 
<EOS>
Fierce
fighting
spread
all
over
Sussex
,
and
everywhere
many
lives
were
being
sacrificed
for
Britain
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
alas
!
<EOS>
with
their
weak
and
totally
inadequate
forces
,
could
make
but
a
sorry
stand
against
the
overwhelming
masses
of
French
and
Russians
,
yet
they
acted
with
conspicuous
bravery
to
sustain
the
honour
of
their
native
land
.
<EOS>
Villages
and
towns
were
devastated
,
rural
homes
were
sacked
and
burned
,
and
everywhere
quiet
,
unoffending
,
but
starving
Britons
were
being
put
to
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Over
Sussex
the
reign
of
terror
was
awful
.
<EOS>
The
pastures
were
stained
by
Britons
'
life
-
blood
,
and
in
all
directions
our
forces
,
though
displaying
their
characteristic
courage
,
were
being
routed
.
<EOS>
At
Horsham
they
were
utterly
defeated
after
a
fierce
and
bloody
encounter
,
in
which
the
enemy
also
lost
very
heavily
;
yet
the
cause
of
the
British
reverse
was
due
solely
to
a
defective
administration
.
<EOS>
Hurriedly
massed
in
the
town
from
Aldershot
by
way
of
Guildford
,
they
had
,
owing
to
the
short
-
sighted
policy
of
the
War
Office
,
arrived
without
a
sufficient
supply
of
either
transport
or
ammunition
.
<EOS>
Night
was
falling
as
they
detrained
,
and
in
the
hopeless
confusion
battalion
commanders
could
not
find
their
brigade
headquarters
,
and
brigadiers
could
not
find
their
staff
.
 
<EOS>
This
extraordinary
muddle
resulted
in
the
fresh
troops
,
instead
of
being
sent
forward
to
reinforce
the
outposts
,
being
kept
in
town
,
while
the
jaded
,
ill
-
fed
men
,
who
had
already
been
on
the
alert
many
hours
,
were
utterly
unable
to
resist
the
organised
attack
which
was
made
before
daybreak
.
 
<EOS>
Though
they
made
a
gallant
stand
and
fought
on
with
desperate
determination
,
yet
at
last
the
whole
of
them
were
driven
back
in
confusion
,
and
with
appalling
loss
,
upon
their
supports
,
and
the
latter
,
who
held
out
bravely
,
were
at
last
also
compelled
to
fall
back
upon
their
reserves
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
which
included
half
a
battery
of
artillery
stationed
at
Wood
's
Farm
and
Toll
Bar
,
held
the
enemy
in
temporary
check
;
but
when
the
heavy
French
artillery
was
at
length
brought
up
,
the
invaders
were
enabled
to
cut
the
railway
,
destroy
the
half
battery
at
Wood
's
Farm
,
turn
the
British
right
flank
,
and
compel
them
to
retreat
hastily
from
Horsham
and
fly
to
defensive
positions
at
Guildford
and
Dorking
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
adroit
manoeuvre
the
enemy
succeeded
in
taking
over
two
hundred
prisoners
,
capturing
the
guns
of
the
12-pounder
field
battery,--which
had
not
been
brought
into
play
for
the
simple
reason
that
only
ammunition
for
9-pounders
had
been
collected
in
the
town,--and
seizing
a
large
quantity
of
stores
and
ammunition
of
various
kinds
.
 
<EOS>
This
success
gave
the
enemy
the
key
to
the
situation
.
 
<EOS>
As
on
sea
,
so
on
land
,
our
blundering
defensive
policy
had
resulted
in
awful
disaster
.
<EOS>
Sufficient
attention
had
never
been
paid
to
detail
,
and
the
firm
-
rooted
idea
that
Britain
could
never
be
invaded
had
caused
careless
indifference
to
minor
matters
of
vital
importance
to
the
stability
of
our
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
The
contrast
between
the
combined
tactics
of
the
enemy
and
those
of
our
forces
was
especially
noticeable
when
the
cavalry
patrol
of
the
British
flying
column
was
captured
on
the
Cowfield
road
and
the
column
defeated
.
<EOS>
The
commander
of
the
column
,
a
well
-
known
officer
,
unfortunately
,
like
many
others
,
had
had
very
little
experience
of
combined
tactics
,
and
looked
upon
cavalry
not
merely
as
"
the
eyes
and
ears
of
an
army
,
"
but
as
the
army
itself
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
defect
that
was
disastrous
.
<EOS>
For
many
years
past
it
had
never
appeared
quite
clear
whether
British
cavalry
were
intended
to
act
_
en
masse
_
in
warfare
,
or
simply
as
scouts
or
mounted
infantry
,
therefore
their
training
had
been
uncertain
.
<EOS>
The
Home
establishment
of
our
cavalry
was
supposed
to
be
about
12,000
men
,
but
owing
to
a
parsimonious
administration
only
about
half
that
number
had
horses
,
and
in
some
corps
less
than
a
half
.
<EOS>
Another
glaring
defect
was
the
division
of
many
regiments
into
detachments
stationed
in
various
towns
,
the
inevitable
result
of
this
being
that
many
such
detachments
were
without
regimental
practice
for
months
,
and
there
were
many
who
had
not
manoeuvred
with
a
force
of
all
arms
_
for
years
<EOS>
_
!
 
<EOS>
Army
organisation
proved
a
miserable
failure
.
 
<EOS>
The
supply
of
ammunition
was
totally
inadequate
,
and
a
disgrace
to
a
nation
which
held
its
head
above
all
others
.
<EOS>
It
was
true
that
depots
had
been
established
at
various
centres
,
yet
with
strange
oversight
no
provision
had
been
made
for
the
work
of
ammunition
trains
.
 
<EOS>
Originally
it
had
been
intended
that
men
for
this
most
important
duty
should
be
found
by
the
Reserves
,
and
that
the
horses
should
be
those
privately
registered
;
nevertheless
it
was
found
necessary
at
the
very
last
moment
to
weaken
our
artillery
by
detailing
experienced
men
for
duty
with
the
ammunition
column
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
horses
which
were
registered
for
service
were
found
to
be
totally
unfit
,
and
very
few
of
the
remainder
had
been
previously
trained
.
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
those
which
were
required
for
the
cavalry
regiments
--
nearly
six
thousand
--
the
best
men
in
the
regiments
had
to
be
told
off
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
invasion
to
hurriedly
train
and
prepare
these
animals
for
service
,
when
they
should
have
been
available
to
proceed
to
any
part
of
the
kingdom
at
twenty
-
four
hours
'
notice
.
<EOS>
By
such
defects
mobilisation
was
foredoomed
to
failure
.
 
<EOS>
The
scheme
,
instead
of
being
so
arranged
as
to
be
carried
out
without
confusion
,
resulted
in
muddle
and
farcical
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
the
infantry
,
owing
to
the
recent
departure
of
the
Indian
drafts
,
had
been
considerably
weakened
,
many
battalions
being
found
on
mobilisation
very
disorganised
and
inefficient
.
<EOS>
As
an
instance
,
out
of
one
battalion
at
Aldershot
,
which
was
on
paper
1000
strong
,
200
had
been
sent
away
to
India
,
while
of
the
remainder
more
than
half
had
only
seen
twelve
months
'
service
,
and
a
large
percentage
were
either
under
eighteen
years
of
age
or
were
"
special
enlistments
,
"
namely
,
below
the
minimum
standard
of
height
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
battalion
compared
very
unfavourably
with
the
majority
of
Volunteer
regiments,--those
of
the
Stafford
Brigade
,
for
instance,--the
average
service
of
the
men
in
those
regiments
being
over
five
years
,
and
the
average
age
twenty
-
seven
years
.
<EOS>
British
officers
had
long
ago
foreseen
all
these
defects
,
and
many
others
,
yet
they
had
preserved
an
enforced
silence
.
<EOS>
They
themselves
were
very
inefficiently
trained
in
manoeuvring
,
for
,
with
one
or
two
exceptions
,
there
were
no
stations
in
the
kingdom
where
forces
were
sufficiently
numerous
to
give
the
majority
of
the
superior
officers
practice
in
handling
combined
bodies
of
troops
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
in
practical
experience
in
the
field
they
were
far
behind
both
French
and
Russians
,
and
it
was
this
very
serious
deficiency
that
now
became
everywhere
apparent
.
 
<EOS>
British
troops
,
fighting
valiantly
,
struggled
to
protect
their
native
land
,
which
they
determined
should
never
fall
under
the
thrall
of
the
invader
.
<EOS>
But
alas
!
<EOS>
their
resistance
,
though
stubborn
and
formidable
,
was
nevertheless
futile
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
lines
of
defence
were
broken
.
 
<EOS>
The
Russian
Eagle
spread
his
black
wings
to
the
sun
,
and
with
joyous
shouts
the
dense
grey
white
masses
of
the
enemy
marched
on
over
the
dusty
<EOS>
Sussex
roads
northward
towards
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
battle
of
Horsham
,
the
gigantic
right
column
of
the
invaders
,
consisting
mostly
of
French
troops
,
followed
up
the
defenders
to
Guildford
and
Dorking
,
preparatory
to
an
attack
upon
London
;
while
the
left
column
,
numbering
150,000
French
and
Russians
of
all
arms
,
pushed
on
through
Alfold
to
Haslemere
,
then
through
Farnham
and
Odiham
to
Swallowfield
,
all
of
which
towns
they
sacked
and
burned
,
the
terrified
inhabitants
being
treated
with
scant
mercy
.
<EOS>
As
the
majority
of
the
defenders
were
massed
in
Kent
,
South
Surrey
,
and
Sussex
,
the
enemy
advanced
practically
unmolested
,
and
at
sunrise
one
morning
a
terrible
panic
was
created
in
Reading
by
the
sudden
descent
upon
the
town
of
a
great
advance
guard
of
10,000
Russians
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
were
appalled
.
<EOS>
They
could
offer
no
resistance
against
the
cavalry
,
who
,
tearing
along
the
straight
high
road
from
Swallowfield
,
swept
down
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Along
this
road
the
whole
gigantic
force
was
moving
,
and
the
Cossack
skirmishers
,
spurring
on
across
the
town
,
passed
away
through
the
Railway
Works
,
and
halted
at
the
bridge
that
spans
the
Thames
at
Caversham
.
<EOS>
They
occupied
it
at
once
,
in
order
to
prevent
it
being
blown
up
before
the
main
body
arrived
,
and
a
brisk
fight
ensued
with
the
small
body
of
defenders
that
had
still
remained
at
the
Brigade
depot
on
the
Purley
Road
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
as
the
French
and
Russian
advance
guard
came
along
,
they
devastated
the
land
with
fire
and
sword
.
<EOS>
The
farms
along
the
road
were
searched
,
and
afterwards
set
on
fire
,
while
not
a
house
at
Three
Mile
Cross
escaped
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
town
from
Whitley
Hill
,
the
great
mass
of
troops
,
working
in
extended
order
,
came
slowly
on
,
and
,
followed
by
140,000
of
the
main
body
and
1000
guns
,
carried
everything
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
No
power
could
stem
the
advancing
tide
of
the
Muscovite
legions
,
and
as
they
poured
into
the
town
in
dense
compact
bodies
,
hundreds
of
townspeople
were
shot
down
ruthlessly
,
merely
because
they
attempted
to
defend
their
homes
.
<EOS>
From
the
Avenue
Works
away
to
the
Cemetery
,
and
from
the
Railway
Station
to
Leighton
Park
,
the
streets
swarmed
with
soldiers
of
the
Tsar
,
who
entered
almost
every
house
in
search
of
plunder
,
and
fired
out
of
sheer
delight
in
bloodshed
upon
hundreds
who
were
flying
for
their
lives
.
 
<EOS>
Men
,
women
,
even
children
,
were
slaughtered
.
<EOS>
The
massacre
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Neither
life
nor
property
was
respected
;
in
every
thoroughfare
brutal
outrages
and
murders
were
committed
,
and
English
homes
were
rendered
desolate
.
 
<EOS>
Almost
the
first
buildings
attacked
were
the
great
factories
of
Messrs.
Huntley
&
Palmer
,
whose
3000
hands
were
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
idle
owing
to
the
famine
.
<EOS>
The
stores
were
searched
for
biscuits
,
and
afterwards
the
whole
factory
was
promptly
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
The
Great
Western
,
Queen
's
,
and
George
Hotels
were
searched
from
garret
to
cellar
,
and
the
wines
and
beer
found
in
the
latter
were
drunk
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
With
the
scant
provisions
found
,
several
of
the
regiments
made
merry
during
the
morning
,
while
others
pursued
their
devastating
work
.
<EOS>
The
banks
were
looted
,
St.
Mary
's
,
Greyfriars
'
,
and
St.
Lawrence
's
Churches
were
burned
,
and
Sutton
&
Sons
'
buildings
and
the
Railway
Works
shared
the
same
fate
,
while
out
in
the
direction
of
Prospect
Hill
Park
all
the
houses
were
sacked
,
and
those
occupants
who
remained
to
guard
their
household
treasures
were
put
to
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
invaders
displayed
the
most
fiendish
brutality
,
and
the
small
force
of
British
troops
who
had
engaged
the
Russian
advance
guard
were
,
after
a
most
fiercely
contested
struggle
,
completely
annihilated
,
not
,
however
,
before
they
had
successfully
placed
charges
of
gun
-
cotton
under
the
bridge
and
blown
it
up
,
together
with
a
number
of
Cossacks
who
had
taken
possession
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
only
checked
the
enemy
's
progress
temporarily
,
for
the
right
flank
crossed
at
Sonning
,
and
as
the
main
body
had
with
them
several
pontoon
sections
,
by
noon
the
pontoons
were
in
position
,
and
the
long
line
of
cavalry
,
infantry
,
artillery
,
and
engineers
,
leaving
behind
Reading
,
now
in
flames
,
crossed
the
Thames
and
wound
away
along
the
road
to
Banbury
,
which
quaint
old
town
,
immortalised
in
nursery
rhyme
,
they
sacked
and
burned
,
destroying
the
historic
Cross
,
and
regaling
themselves
upon
the
ale
found
in
the
cellars
of
the
inns
,
the
Red
and
White
Lions
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
again
continued
their
march
,
practically
unmolested
;
while
Oxford
was
also
entered
and
sacked
.
 
<EOS>
True
,
scouts
reported
strong
forces
of
the
defenders
advancing
across
from
Market
Harborough
,
Kettering
,
and
Oundle
,
and
once
or
twice
British
outposts
had
sharp
encounters
with
the
Russians
along
the
hills
between
Ladbrooke
and
Daventry
,
resulting
in
serious
losses
on
both
sides
;
nevertheless
the
gigantic
force
of
Russians
still
proceeded
,
sweeping
away
every
obstacle
from
their
path
.
 
<EOS>
On
leaving
Banbury
,
the
enemy
,
marching
in
column
of
route
,
took
the
road
through
Stratford
-
on
-
Avon
to
Wootton
Wawen
,
where
a
halt
for
twenty
-
four
hours
was
made
in
order
to
mature
plans
for
an
organised
attack
on
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
Wootton
Hall
,
after
being
looted
,
was
made
the
headquarters
,
and
from
thence
was
issued
an
order
on
the
following
day
which
caused
Warwick
and
Leamington
to
be
swept
and
burned
by
the
invaders
,
who
afterwards
broke
into
two
divisions
.
<EOS>
One
body
,
consisting
of
50,000
men
,
including
an
advance
guard
of
5000
,
took
the
right
-
hand
road
from
Wootton
to
Birmingham
,
through
Sparkbrook
;
while
the
remaining
100,000
bore
away
to
the
left
through
Ullenhall
and
Holt
End
to
the
extremity
of
the
Hagley
Hills
,
intending
to
occupy
them
.
<EOS>
They
had
already
been
informed
that
strong
defences
had
been
established
at
King
's
Norton
,
in
the
immediate
vicinity
,
and
knew
that
severe
fighting
must
inevitably
ensue
;
therefore
they
lost
no
time
in
establishing
themselves
along
the
high
ground
between
Redditch
and
Barnt
Green
,
in
a
position
commanding
the
two
main
roads
south
from
Dudley
and
Birmingham
.
 
<EOS>
That
a
most
desperate
stand
would
be
made
for
the
defence
of
the
Metropolis
of
the
Midlands
<EOS>
the
Russian
commander
was
well
aware
.
<EOS>
After
the
long
march
his
troops
were
jaded
,
so
,
bivouacing
in
Hewell
Park
,
he
awaited
for
nearly
two
days
the
reports
of
his
spies
.
<EOS>
These
were
not
so
reassuring
as
he
had
anticipated
,
for
it
appeared
that
the
high
ground
south
of
the
city
,
notably
at
King
's
Norton
,
Northfield
,
Harborne
,
Edgbaston
,
and
along
the
Hagley
Road
,
was
occupied
by
strong
bodies
of
troops
and
a
large
number
of
guns
,
and
that
every
preparation
had
been
made
for
a
stubborn
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
appeared
that
at
the
entrance
to
the
city
at
Sparkbrook
,
which
road
had
been
taken
by
the
right
column
,
very
little
resistance
was
likely
to
be
offered
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
positions
occupied
by
the
defenders
had
been
very
carefully
chosen
as
the
most
advantageous
the
Russian
commander
was
bound
to
admit
,
and
although
he
possessed
such
a
large
body
of
men
it
would
require
considerable
tactical
skill
to
dislodge
the
defenders
in
order
to
prevent
them
covering
with
their
guns
the
country
over
which
the
Russian
division
,
taking
the
right
-
hand
roads
,
must
travel
.

THE
BATTLEFIELD
OF
BIRMINGHAM
.
]
 
<EOS>
During
that
day
an
encounter
of
a
most
fierce
description
occurred
between
hostile
reconnoitring
parties
on
the
road
between
Bromsgrove
Lickey
and
Northfield
.
<EOS>
The
road
gradually
ascended
with
a
walled
-
in
plantation
on
either
side
,
and
the
enemy
were
proceeding
at
a
comfortable
pace
when
suddenly
a
number
of
rifles
rattled
out
simultaneously
,
and
then
it
was
discovered
that
the
wall
had
been
loopholed
,
and
that
the
British
were
pouring
upon
them
a
deadly
hail
from
which
there
was
no
shelter
.
<EOS>
The
walls
bristled
with
rifles
,
and
from
them
came
a
storm
of
bullets
that
killed
and
wounded
dozens
of
the
invaders
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
showed
considerable
daring
,
for
while
the
magazine
rifles
poured
forth
their
deadly
shower
,
they
rallied
and
charged
up
the
hill
in
the
face
of
the
fearful
odds
against
them
.
<EOS>
For
ten
minutes
or
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
fighting
was
a
desperate
hand
-
to
-
hand
one
,
the
enemy
entering
the
plantation
with
a
dash
that
surprised
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
Gradually
,
although
outnumbered
by
the
Russians
,
the
British
at
length
,
by
dint
of
the
most
strenuous
effort
and
hard
fighting
,
succeeded
in
inflicting
frightful
loss
upon
the
invaders
,
and
the
latter
,
after
a
most
desperate
stand
,
eventually
retreated
in
confusion
down
into
the
valley
,
leaving
nearly
two
-
thirds
of
the
party
dead
or
dying
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
,
whose
losses
were
very
small
,
had
shown
the
invaders
that
they
meant
to
defend
Birmingham
,
and
that
every
inch
of
ground
they
gained
would
have
to
be
won
by
sheer
fighting
.
<EOS>
An
hour
later
another
fierce
encounter
occurred
in
the
same
neighbourhood
,
and
of
the
4000
Russians
who
had
advanced
along
that
road
not
<EOS>
900
returned
to
the
main
body
,
such
havoc
the
British
Maxims
caused
;
while
at
the
same
time
a
further
disaster
occurred
to
the
enemy
in
another
direction
,
for
away
at
Tanworth
their
outposts
had
been
completely
annihilated
,
those
who
were
not
killed
being
taken
prisoners
by
the
3rd
South
Staffordshire
Volunteers
,
who
,
under
Colonel
E.
Nayler
,
acted
with
conspicuous
bravery
.
<EOS>
In
every
direction
the
enemy
's
outposts
and
advance
guards
were
being
harassed
,
cut
up
,
and
hurled
back
in
disorder
with
heavy
loss
,
therefore
the
Russian
commander
decided
that
a
sudden
and
rapid
movement
forward
in
order
to
effect
a
junction
with
his
right
column
was
the
only
means
by
which
the
position
could
be
carried
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
events
were
occurring
rapidly
all
over
the
country
south
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
commander
of
the
Russian
left
column
,
deciding
to
commence
the
attack
forthwith
,
moved
on
his
forces
just
before
midnight
in
order
to
commence
the
onslaught
before
daybreak
,
knowing
the
British
forces
always
relieve
their
outposts
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
Again
,
it
was
necessary
to
advance
under
cover
of
darkness
in
order
to
prevent
the
defenders
'
artillery
,
which
now
commanded
the
road
between
Alcester
and
Moseley
,
firing
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Having
received
a
message
from
the
right
column
stating
that
their
advance
guard
had
pushed
on
to
Olton
End
with
outposts
at
Sheldon
and
Yardley
,
and
announcing
their
intention
of
advancing
through
Sparkbrook
upon
the
city
before
dawn
,
the
commanding
officer
,
leaving
some
artillery
at
Barnt
Green
,
and
sending
on
cavalry
to
Stourbridge
and
Cradley
to
turn
the
English
flank
at
Halesowen
,
manoeuvred
rapidly
,
bringing
the
main
body
of
cavalry
and
infantry
back
to
Alvechurch
,
thence
across
to
Weatheroak
,
and
then
striking
due
north
,
again
marched
by
the
three
roads
leading
to
King
's
Norton
.
 
<EOS>
The
high
ground
here
he
knew
was
strongly
defended
,
<EOS>
and
it
was
about
a
quarter
to
two
o'clock
when
the
British
,
by
means
of
their
search
-
lights
,
discovered
the
great
dark
masses
advancing
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Quickly
their
guns
opened
fire
,
and
the
sullen
booming
of
cannon
was
answered
by
the
Russian
battery
near
Barnt
Green
.
<EOS>
Over
Birmingham
the
noise
was
heard
,
and
had
volumes
of
terrible
significance
for
the
turbulent
crowds
who
filled
the
broad
thoroughfares
.
<EOS>
The
search
-
lights
used
by
both
invaders
and
defenders
turned
night
into
day
,
and
the
battle
proceeded
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
carefully
prepared
their
plans
,
for
almost
at
the
same
moment
that
they
assaulted
the
position
at
King
's
Norton
,
a
battery
of
Russian
artillery
opened
a
terrible
fire
from
the
hill
at
Tanner
's
Green
,
while
the
attacking
column
extended
their
right
across
to
Colebrook
Hall
,
with
intent
to
push
across
to
Moseley
Station
,
and
thus
gain
the
top
of
the
ridge
of
the
ground
in
the
rear
of
the
British
positions
,
and
so
hem
in
the
British
force
and
allow
the
right
column
to
advance
through
Small
Heath
and
Sparkbrook
unchecked
.
 
<EOS>
These
simultaneous
attacks
met
in
the
valley
separating
the
parallel
ridges
held
by
the
Russians
and
British
,
and
the
fighting
became
at
once
fierce
and
stubborn
.
<EOS>
A
furious
infantry
fire
raged
for
over
an
hour
in
the
valley
between
the
excellent
position
held
by
the
defenders
at
King
's
Norton
and
the
lower
wooded
ridge
occupied
by
the
Russians
,
who
had
succeeded
in
capturing
half
a
British
battery
who
held
it
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
bareness
of
the
slope
,
the
Russians
went
down
into
battle
without
cover
,
cut
up
terribly
by
the
British
infantry
fire
,
and
by
the
shell
fire
from
the
King
's
Norton
batteries
.
<EOS>
From
the
British
trenches
between
Broad
Meadow
and
Moundsley
Hall
a
galling
fire
was
poured
,
and
Russian
infantry
fell
in
hundreds
over
the
undulating
fields
between
the
high
road
to
Alcester
and
the
Blithe
River
.
 
<EOS>
From
a
ridge
on
the
Stratford
Road
,
near
Monkspath
Street
,
heavy
Russian
artillery
opened
fire
just
before
dawn
,
and
played
terrible
havoc
with
the
British
guns
,
which
on
the
sky
-
line
opposite
afforded
a
mark
.
<EOS>
As
time
crept
on
there
was
no
cessation
in
the
thunder
on
either
side
,
while
away
along
the
valleys
a
most
bloody
encounter
was
in
progress
.
<EOS>
The
whole
stretch
of
country
was
one
huge
battlefield
.
<EOS>
British
and
Russians
fell
in
hundreds
,
nay
,
in
thousands
.
 
<EOS>
The
losses
on
every
side
were
appalling

the
fortune
of
war
trembled
in
the

CHAPTER
XIX
.
 
<EOS>
FALL
OF
BIRMINGHAM
.
  
<EOS>
The
battle
outside
Birmingham
was
long
,
fierce
,
and
furious
.
<EOS>
No
more
desperately
contested
engagement
had
ever
occurred
in
the
history
of
the
British
Empire
.
<EOS>
From
the
very
first
moment
of
the
fight
it
was
apparent
that
the
struggle
would
be
a
fearful
one
,
both
sides
possessing
advantages
;
the
British
by
reason
of
the
magnificent
defensive
positions
they
occupied
,
and
the
Russians
by
reason
of
their
overwhelming
numbers
.
<EOS>
Against
a
defending
force
of
50,000
of
all
arms
,
150,000
invaders
--
the
majority
of
whom
were
Russians
--
were
now
fighting
,
and
the
combat
was
necessarily
long
and
deadly
.
<EOS>
British
Volunteers
were
conspicuous
everywhere
by
their
bravery
;
the
Canadians
rendered
most
valuable
assistance
,
firing
from
time
to
time
with
excellent
precision
,
and
holding
their
position
with
splendid
courage
;
while
the
Irish
Brigade
,
who
had
moved
rapidly
from
King
's
Cliffe
by
train
and
road
,
and
had
arrived
in
time
,
now
held
their
own
in
a
position
close
to
Kingsheath
House
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
principal
buildings
in
Birmingham
had
during
the
past
day
or
two
been
converted
into
hospitals
,
amongst
others
the
Post
Office
,
where
the
trained
nurses
received
very
valuable
assistance
from
the
female
clerks
.
<EOS>
A
train
full
of
British
wounded
was
captured
early
in
the
evening
at
Barnt
Green
.
<EOS>
It
contained
regular
troops
and
civilians
from
the
Stratford
force
which
had
fallen
back
to
Alcester
,
and
the
train
had
been
sent
on
from
there
in
the
hope
that
it
would
get
through
before
the
enemy
were
able
to
cut
the
line
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
accomplished
,
for
the
Russians
inhumanely
turned
out
the
wounded
and
filled
the
train
with
their
own
troops
and
ammunition
.
<EOS>
Then
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
Birmingham
railway
man
of
French
nationality
who
had
been
acting
as
spy
,
the
train
proceeded
to
New
Street
Station
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
the
officials
at
the
station
to
cope
with
the
enemy
,
for
they
had
only
expected
their
own
wounded
,
or
they
would
,
of
course
,
have
wrecked
the
train
by
altering
the
points
before
it
arrived
in
the
station
.
<EOS>
The
Russians
therefore
detrained
,
and
,
led
by
their
spy
,
made
a
dash
along
the
subway
leading
to
the
lifts
ascending
to
the
Post
Office
.
<EOS>
These
were
secured
,
and
the
Office
was
soon
captured
by
the
Russians
,
who
not
only
thereby
obtained
a
footing
in
the
very
centre
of
the
town
from
which
there
was
not
much
chance
of
dislodging
them
before
Birmingham
fell
,
but
they
had
also
obtained
possession
of
the
most
important
telegraph
centre
for
the
North
and
Midland
districts
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
first
flush
of
dawn
the
whole
of
the
country
from
Kings
Norton
right
across
to
Solihull
was
one
huge
battlefield
,
and
when
the
sun
rose
,
bright
and
glorious
,
its
rays
were
obscured
by
the
clouds
of
smoke
which
hung
like
a
funeral
pall
over
hill
and
dale
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
period
the
principal
Russian
battery
on
the
Stratford
Road
was
short
of
ammunition
,
and
,
seeing
this
,
the
strong
British
battery
at
Northfield
moved
quickly
up
into
a
commanding
position
at
Drake
's
Cross
,
not
,
however
,
before
it
had
been
considerably
weakened
by
the
Russian
fire
from
Bromsgrove
Lickey
.
<EOS>
During
this
time
,
however
,
detachments
of
Canadian
marksmen
had
been
detailed
with
no
other
purpose
than
to
sweep
the
Russian
road
at
the
exposed
points
of
its
course
,
and
to
fire
at
everything
and
everybody
exposed
on
the
ridge
.
<EOS>
This
was
most
effective
,
and
for
quite
half
an
hour
prevented
any
supply
of
ammunition
reaching
the
enemy
,
thus
giving
the
British
battery
an
opportunity
to
establish
itself
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
both
batteries
of
defenders
opened
fire
simultaneously
upon
the
Russian
guns
,
and
so
thickly
fell
the
shots
,
that
although
ammunition
had
by
this
time
been
brought
up
,
the
enemy
's
power
in
that
quarter
was
completely
broken
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
the
fierce
struggle
was
confined
to
cavalry
and
infantry
.
<EOS>
Troops
of
Cossacks
,
sweeping
up
the
banks
of
the
Arrow
,
encountered
British
Hussars
and
cut
into
them
with
frightful
effect
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
fighting
hard
as
the
day
wore
on
,
hindered
the
enemy
from
gaining
any
material
advantage
,
though
the
latter
forced
the
outer
line
of
the
British
shelter
trenches
on
the
slopes
below
the
position
of
King
's
Norton
.
<EOS>
The
Canadians
had
laid
mines
in
front
of
their
trenches
,
which
were
exploded
just
as
the
head
of
the
Russian
assaulting
parties
were
massed
above
them
,
and
large
numbers
of
the
Tsar
's
infantry
were
blown
into
atoms
.
 
<EOS>
Bullets
were
singing
along
the
valleys
like
swarms
of
angry
wasps
,
and
the
Russian
losses
in
every
direction
were
enormous
.
 
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
the
fighting
continued
.
<EOS>
The
British
held
good
positions
,
with
an
inner
line
of
defence
across
from
Selly
Oak
,
Harborne
,
and
Edgbaston
,
to
the
high
crest
on
the
Hagley
Road
,
close
to
the
Fountain
,
while
the
Russians
swarmed
over
the
country
in
overwhelming
numbers
.
<EOS>
The
frightful
losses
the
latter
were
sustaining
by
reason
of
the
defenders
'
artillery
fire
did
not
,
however
,
disconcert
them
.
<EOS>
But
for
the
huge
right
column
of
invaders
advancing
on
Birmingham
by
way
of
Acock
's
Green
,
it
seemed
an
even
match
,
yet
as
afternoon
passed
the
firing
in
the
valley
swelled
in
volume
,
and
the
mad
clamour
of
battle
still
surged
up
into
the
blue
cloudless
heavens
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
could
see
on
the
sky
-
line
the
British
reinforcements
as
they
came
up
from
Halesowen
by
the
road
close
to
their
battery
on
the
bare
spot
near
the
edge
of
their
right
flank
,
and
it
was
decided
at
four
o'clock
to
deliver
a
counter
flank
attack
on
the
left
edge
of
the
British
position
,
simultaneously
with
a
renewed
strenuous
assault
by
the
tirailleurs
from
below
.
<EOS>
Soon
this
desperate
manoeuvre
was
commenced
,
and
although
the
marching
ground
was
good
,
the
British
guns
swept
them
with
their
terrible
fire
,
and
hundreds
of
the
Tsar
's
soldiers
dyed
the
meadows
with
their
blood
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fierce
,
mad
dash
.
<EOS>
The
British
attacked
vigorously
on
every
side
,
fought
bravely
,
straining
every
nerve
to
repulse
their
foe
.
 
<EOS>
The
battle
had
been
the
most
fiercely
contested
of
any
during
the
struggle
,
and
in
this
desperate
assault
on
King
's
Norton
the
Russians
had
suffered
appalling
losses
.
<EOS>
The
valleys
and
slopes
were
strewn
with
dead
and
dying
,
and
a
bullet
had
struck
the
British
commander
,
mortally
wounding
him

As
he
was
borne
away
to
the
ambulance
waggon
,
the
last
words
on
that
noble
soldier
's
lips
were
a
fervent
wish
for
good
fortune
to
the
arms
of
the
Queen
he
had
served
so
well
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
British
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
outnumbered
,
and
at
last
retreating
in
disorder
,
were
followed
over
the
hills
to
Halesowen
and
utterly
routed
,
while
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
marching
up
the
Bristol
and
Pershore
Roads
,
extended
their
left
across
to
Harborne
and
Edgbaston
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
however
,
the
guns
placed
on
the
edge
of
the
city
along
the
Hagley
Road
near
the
Fountain
,
and
in
Beech
Lane
close
to
the
Talbot
Inn
,
as
well
as
the
Volunteer
batteries
near
St.
Augustine
's
Church
and
Westfield
Road
,
opened
fire
upon
the
advancing
legions
.
<EOS>
The
two
lower
roads
taken
by
the
enemy
were
well
commanded
by
the
British
guns
,
and
the
Volunteers
,
with
the
Canadians
and
Irish
,
again
rendered
most
valuable
assistance
,
everywhere
displaying
cool
and
conspicuous
courage
.
<EOS>
The
walls
of
the
new
villas
along
the
Hagley
Road
,
Portland
Road
,
and
Beech
Lane
had
been
placed
in
a
state
of
hasty
defence
,
and
rifles
bristled
everywhere
,
but
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
long
range
of
purple
hills
<EOS>
the
fight
was
in
the
balance
.
<EOS>
The
British
,
as
they
stood
,
could
almost
keep
back
the
foe
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
not
quite
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
soon
a
concentric
rush
for
the
hill
,
and
as
the
cannons
thundered
and
rifles
rattled
,
hundreds
of
the
grey
-
coats
fell
back
and
rolled
down
the
steep
slope
dead
and
dying
,
but
the
others
pushed
on
in
face
of
the
frowning
defences
,
used
their
bayonets
with
desperate
energy
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
loud
shouts
in
Russian
told
that
the
ridge
had
been
cleared
and
the
position
won
.
<EOS>
The
battle
had
been
long
and
terrible
;
the
carnage
awful
!
 
<EOS>
The
British
,
making
a
last
desperate
stand
,
fought
a
fierce
hand
-
to
-
hand
struggle
,
but
ere
long
half
their
number
lay
helpless
in
the
newly
-
made
suburban
roads
,
and
the
remainder
were
compelled
to
leave
their
guns
in
possession
of
the
enemy
and
fly
north
to
Sandwell
to
save
themselves
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
they
fled
,
the
Russians
turned
the
British
guns
near
St.
Augustine
's
upon
them
,
causing
havoc
in
their
rear
.
 
<EOS>
The
shattered
left
column
of
the
enemy
,
having
at
length
broken
down
the
British
defences
,
raised
loud
victorious
yells
,
and
,
after
reorganising
,
marched
down
the
Hagley
Road
upon
the
city
,
fighting
from
house
to
house
the
whole
way
.
<EOS>
The
gardens
in
front
of
these
houses
,
however
,
aided
the
defenders
greatly
in
checking
the
advance
.
 
<EOS>
The
sacrifice
of
human
life
during
those
hours
from
daybreak
to
sundown
had
been
frightful
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
,
from
Great
Packington
to
Halesowen
,
was
strewn
with
blood
-
smeared
corpses
.
 
<EOS>
Having
regard
to
the
fact
that
the
defending
force
consisted
of
only
50,000
men
against
100,000
Russians
,
the
losses
inflicted
upon
the
latter
spoke
volumes
for
British
pluck
and
military
skill
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
field
10,000
Russians
lay
dead
,
30,000
were
wounded
,
and
2000
were
prisoners
,
while
the
defenders
'
total
loss
in
killed
and
wounded
only
amounted
to
20,000
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
reinforcements
,
numbering
50,000
,
from
the
right
column
,
which
were
by
this
time
coming
up
with
all
speed
from
Acock
's
Green
,
the
Russians
,
in
their
terribly
jaded
and
demoralised
state
,
could
not
have
marched
upon
the
city
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
however
,
the
occupation
commenced
as
night
drew
on
;
the
fighting
that
followed
being
principally
done
by
the
reinforcements
.
 
<EOS>
Leaving
no
fewer
than
42,000
men
dead
,
wounded
,
and
captured
,
the
invaders
pushed
on
into
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
Though
the
citizens
'
losses
had
already
been
terrific
,
nevertheless
they
found
that
they
were
still
determined
to
hold
out
.
<EOS>
In
all
the
principal
roads
leading
into
the
city
barricades
had
been
formed
,
and
behind
them
were
bands
of
desperate
men
,
well
equipped
,
and
prepared
to
fight
on
to
the
bitter
end
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
in
the
Hagley
Road
had
been
constructed
at
the
junction
of
Monument
Road
,
and
as
the
skirmishers
and
advance
guard
approached
,
offered
a
most
desperate
resistance
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
a
vigorous
rifle
fire
that
poured
from
the
improvised
defences
,
three
Maxims
were
brought
into
play
from
the
roofs
of
large
houses
,
and
these
,
commanding
the
whole
road
as
far
as
its
junction
with
Beech
Lane
,
literally
mowed
down
the
enemy
as
they
approached
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
Russians
rushed
upon
the
defenders
'
position
,
only
to
be
hurled
back
again
by
the
leaden
hail
,
which
fell
so
thickly
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
body
of
troops
to
withstand
it
.
<EOS>
By
this
the
invaders
'
advance
was
temporarily
checked
,
but
it
was
not
long
before
they
established
a
battery
at
the
corner
of
Norfolk
Road
,
and
poured
shell
upon
the
barricade
with
frightful
effect
.
<EOS>
Quickly
the
guns
were
silenced
,
and
the
Russians
at
last
breaking
down
the
barrier
,
engaged
in
a
conflict
at
close
quarters
with
the
defenders
.
 
<EOS>
The
road
along
to
Five
Ways
was
desperately
contested
.
<EOS>
The
slaughter
on
both
sides
was
awful
,
for
a
detachment
of
Russians
coming
up
the
Harborne
Road
had
been
utterly
annihilated
and
swept
away
by
the
rifle
fire
of
defenders
concealed
behind
loopholed
walls
.
<EOS>
At
Five
Ways
the
entrance
to
each
of
the
five
broad
converging
thoroughfares
had
been
strongly
barricaded
,
and
as
the
enemy
pressed
forward
the
British
machine
guns
established
there
caused
terrible
havoc
.
<EOS>
Behind
those
barricades
men
of
Birmingham
of
every
class
,
armed
with
all
sorts
of
guns
,
hastily
obtained
from
Kynoch
's
and
other
factories
,
struggled
for
the
defence
of
their
homes
and
loved
ones
,
working
with
a
dash
and
energy
that
greatly
disconcerted
the
enemy
,
who
had
imagined
that
,
in
view
of
their
victory
in
the
battle
,
little
resistance
would
be
offered
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
darkness
that
had
now
fallen
the
scenes
in
the
streets
were
frightful
.
<EOS>
The
only
light
was
the
flash
from
gun
-
muzzles
and
the
glare
of
flames
consuming
private
houses
and
public
buildings
.
<EOS>
The
civilian
defenders
,
reinforced
by
Regular
soldiers
,
Militia
,
and
Volunteers
,
had
made
such
excellent
preparations
for
defence
,
and
offered
such
strenuous
opposition
,
that
almost
every
foot
the
Russians
gained
in
the
direction
of
the
centre
of
the
city
was
fought
for
hand
to
hand
.
<EOS>
Both
right
and
left
Russian
columns
were
now
advancing
up
the
Coventry
,
Stratford
,
Moseley
,
Pershore
,
and
Bristol
Roads
,
and
in
each
of
those
thoroughfares
the
barricades
were
strongly
constructed
,
and
,
being
armed
with
Maxims
,
wrought
frightful
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
,
however
,
one
after
another
of
these
defences
fell
by
reason
of
the
organised
attacks
by
such
superior
numbers
,
and
the
Russians
marched
on
,
killing
with
bayonet
and
sword
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
city
,
as
the
night
passed
,
the
fighting
in
the
streets
everywhere
was
of
the
fiercest
and
most
sanguinary
description
.
<EOS>
In
Corporation
Street
a
huge
barricade
with
machine
guns
had
been
constructed
opposite
the
Victoria
Law
Courts
,
and
,
assisted
by
200
Volunteers
,
who
,
inside
the
latter
building
,
fired
from
the
windows
,
the
enemy
were
held
in
check
for
several
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
shells
fell
from
the
Russian
guns
in
the
midst
of
the
defenders
,
and
,
bursting
,
decimated
them
in
a
horrible
manner
;
yet
through
the
long
close
night
there
was
never
a
lack
of
brave
men
to
step
into
the
breach
and
take
up
the
arms
of
their
dead
comrades
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
only
when
the
enemy
succeeded
in
setting
fire
to
the
Courts
,
and
compelling
the
defenders
to
cease
their
vigorous
rifle
fire
from
the
windows
,
that
the
position
was
won
;
and
not
until
hundreds
of
Russians
lay
dead
or
dying
in
the
street
.
 
<EOS>
In
New
Street
the
Irish
Volunteers
distinguished
themselves
conspicuously
.
<EOS>
After
the
retreat
they
had
been
withdrawn
with
the
Canadians
into
the
city
,
and
,
waiting
in
the
side
thoroughfares
at
the
opposite
end
of
New
Street
,
held
themselves
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
the
enemy
rushed
along
in
their
direction
,
an
order
was
given
,
and
they
formed
up
,
and
stretching
across
the
street
,
met
them
with
volley
after
volley
of
steady
firing
;
then
,
rushing
onward
with
fixed
bayonets
,
charged
almost
before
the
Russians
were
aware
of
their
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Without
a
thought
of
his
own
personal
safety
,
every
Irishman
cast
himself
into
the
thick
of
the
fray
,
and
,
backed
by
a
strong
body
of
Canadians
and
fusiliers
<EOS>
,
they
succeeded
in
cutting
their
way
completely
into
the
invaders
,
and
driving
them
back
into
Corporation
Street
,
where
they
were
forced
right
under
the
fire
of
four
Maxims
that
had
just
at
that
moment
been
brought
into
position
outside
the
Exchange
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
these
guns
rattled
out
simultaneously
,
and
the
Russians
,
unable
to
advance
,
and
standing
at
the
head
of
the
long
broad
thoroughfare
,
were
swept
down
with
awful
swiftness
and
with
scarcely
any
resistance
.
<EOS>
So
sudden
had
been
their
fate
,
that
of
a
force
over
two
thousand
strong
,
not
more
than
a
dozen
escaped
,
although
the
defenders
were
taken
in
rear
by
the
force
of
500
Russians
who
had
occupied
the
Post
Office
on
the
previous
night
.
 
<EOS>
From
Corporation
Street
a
brilliant
,
ruddy
glow
suffused
the
sky
,
as
both
the
Law
Courts
and
the
Grand
Theatre
were
in
flames
,
while
St.
Mary
's
Church
and
the
Market
Hall
had
also
been
fired
by
incendiaries
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
panic
and
confusion
,
conflagrations
were
breaking
out
everywhere
,
flames
bursting
forth
from
several
fine
shops
in
New
Street
which
had
already
been
sacked
and
wrecked
.
<EOS>
Maddened
by
their
success
,
by
the
thirst
for
the
blood
of
their
enemies
,
and
the
rash
deeds
of
incendiaries
,
the
Muscovite
legions
spread
over
the
whole
city
,
and
outrage
and
murder
were
common
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
Away
up
Great
Hampton
Street
and
Hockley
Hill
<EOS>
the
jewellery
factories
were
looted
,
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
pounds
worth
of
gems
and
gold
were
carried
off
,
while
the
Mint
was
entered
,
afterwards
being
burned
because
only
copper
coins
were
found
there
,
and
the
pictures
in
the
Art
Gallery
were
wantonly
slashed
by
sabres
and
bayonets
.
 
<EOS>
The
scenes
on
that
memorable
night
were
awful
.
<EOS>
Birmingham
,
one
of
the
most
wealthy
cities
in
the
kingdom
,
fell
at
last
,
after
a
most
stubborn
resistance
,
for
just
before
day
broke
the
overwhelming
forces
of
Russia
occupying
the
streets
commenced
to
drive
out
the
defenders
,
and
shoot
down
those
who
turned
to
resist
.
<EOS>
From
Bordesley
to
Handsworth
,
and
from
Smethwick
to
Aston
,
the
city
was
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
banks
in
New
Street
were
broken
open
,
and
the
gold
stuffed
into
the
pockets
of
the
uncouth
dwellers
on
the
Don
and
the
Volga
,
Chamberlain
's
Memorial
was
wrecked
,
and
Queen
's
College
occupied
by
infantry
.
<EOS>
Cossack
officers
established
themselves
in
the
Grand
and
Queen
's
Hotels
,
and
their
men
were
billeted
at
the
Midland
,
Union
,
Conservative
,
and
other
Clubs
,
and
at
many
minor
hotels
and
buildings
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
dawn
had
spread
,
whole
rows
of
shops
were
burning
,
their
brilliant
glare
illuminating
the
streets
that
ran
with
blood
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fearful
scene
of
death
and
desolation
.
 
<EOS>
The
majority
of
the
citizens
had
fled
,
leaving
everything
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
,
who
still
continued
their
work
of
pillage
.
<EOS>
In
the
streets
the
bodies
of
10,000
Russians
and
3000
British
lay
unheeded
,
while
no
fewer
than
9000
of
the
enemy
's
infantry
had
been
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
The
headquarters
of
the
Russian
army
had
at
last
been
established
in
a
British
city
,
for
over
the
great
Council
House
there
now
lazily
flapped
in
the
fresh
morning
breeze
the
great
yellow
-
and
-
black
flag
of
the
Tsar
Alexander
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Russian
General
,
finding
he
had
lost
the
enormous
force
of
61,000
men
,
spent
the
grey
hours
of
dawn
in
nervous
anxiousness
,
pacing
the
room
in
which
he
had
installed
himself
,
contemplating
the
frightful
disaster
,
and
undecided
how
next
to
act
.
 
<EOS>
An
incident
illustrative
of
the
fierceness
of
the
fight
outside
the
city
was
published
in
the
_
Times
_
several
days
later
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
extract
from
a
private
letter
written
by
Lieut
.
<EOS>
J.
G.
Morris
of
the
3rd
Battalion
of
the
York
and
Lancaster
Regiment
,
and
was
as
follows:--
 
<EOS>
"
The
sun
that
day
was
blazing
and
merciless
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
morning
our
battalion
had
lost
heavily
in
the
valley
,
when
suddenly
at
about
twelve
o'clock
the
enemy
apparently
received
reinforcements
,
and
we
were
then
driven
back
upon
Weatheroak
by
sheer
force
of
numbers
,
and
afterwards
again
fell
further
back
towards
our
position
on
the
high
ground
in
Hagley
Road

"
In
this
hasty
retreat
I
found
myself
with
a
sergeant
and
eighteen
men
pursued
by
a
large
skirmishing
party
of
Russians
.
<EOS>
All
we
could
do
was
to
fly
before
them
.
<EOS>
This
we
did
,
until
at
length
,
turning
into
Beech
Lane
,
we
found
ourselves
before
a
small
,
low
-
built
ancient
hostelry
,
the
King
's
Head
Inn
,
with
a
dilapidated
and
somewhat
crude
counterfeit
presentment
of
King
George
II
.
<EOS>
outside
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
unoccupied
,
and
I
decided
immediately
to
enter
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
count
on
every
one
of
my
men
;
therefore
very
soon
we
were
inside
,
and
had
barricaded
the
little
place
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
we
accomplished
this
when
the
first
shots
rang
out
,
and
in
a
few
moments
the
space
outside
where
the
cross
-
roads
meet
literally
swarmed
with
Russians
,
who
quickly
extended
,
and
,
seeking
cover
at
the
junction
of
each
of
the
five
roads
,
commenced
a
terrific
fusillade
.
<EOS>
The
windows
from
which
we
fired
were
smashed
,
the
woodwork
splintered
everywhere
,
and
so
thickly
came
the
bullets
that
my
men
had
to
exercise
the
utmost
caution
in
concealing
themselves
while
firing
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
one
man
had
been
struck
and
lay
dead
by
my
side
,
while
at
the
same
time
the
terrible
truth
suddenly
dawned
upon
me
that
our
ammunition
could
not
last
out
.
<EOS>
Regulating
the
firing
,
I
rushed
to
one
of
the
back
windows
that
commanded
the
valley
down
to
Harborne
,
and
saw
advancing
along
the
road
in
our
direction
,
and
raising
a
cloud
of
dust
,
about
a
thousand
Russian
cavalry
and
infantry
.
 
<EOS>
"
Back
again
to
the
front
room
I
dashed
,
just
in
time
to
witness
the
enemy
make
a
wild
rush
towards
us
.
<EOS>
Our
slackened
fire
had
deceived
them
,
and
as
the
storming
party
dashed
forward
,
they
were
met
by
vigorous
volleys
from
our
magazine
rifles
,
which
knocked
over
dozens
,
and
compelled
the
remainder
to
again
retire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Again
the
enemy
made
a
desperate
onslaught
,
and
again
we
succeeded
in
hurling
them
back
,
and
stretching
dead
a
dozen
or
more
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
great
force
of
Russians
was
moving
slowly
up
the
hill
,
and
I
knew
that
to
hold
the
place
much
longer
would
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
From
the
rear
of
the
building
a
vigorous
attack
had
now
commenced
,
and
moving
more
men
round
to
the
rear
,
so
that
our
fire
would
command
the
sloping
approach
to
the
house
,
I
gave
an
order
to
fire
steadily
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
my
sergeant
and
two
other
men
had
been
severely
wounded
,
and
although
the
former
had
had
his
arm
broken
,
and
was
near
fainting
from
loss
of
blood
,
nevertheless
he
kept
up
,
resting
his
rifle
-
barrel
upon
the
shattered
window
-
ledge
,
and
pouring
out
the
deadly
contents
of
his
magazine
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
few
minutes
afterwards
a
bullet
shattered
my
left
hand
,
and
the
man
who
crouched
next
to
me
under
the
window
was
a
second
later
shot
through
the
heart
,
and
fell
back
dead
among
the
disordered
furniture
.
 
<EOS>
"
Still
not
a
man
hesitated
,
not
a
word
of
despair
was
uttered
.
<EOS>
We
all
knew
that
death
stared
us
in
the
face
,
and
that
to
face
it
bravely
was
a
Briton
's
duty
.
<EOS>
Only
once
I
shouted
above
the
din
:
'
Do
your
best
,
boys
!
<EOS>
Remember
we
we
are
all
Britons
,
and
those
vermin
outside
have
wrecked
our
homes
and
killed
those
we
love
.
<EOS>
Let
's
have
our
revenge
,
even
if
we
die
for
it
!
'
 
<EOS>
"
'
We
'll
stick
to
'em
till
the
very
last
,
sir
,
never
fear
,
'
cheerily
replied
one
young
fellow
as
he
reloaded
his
gun
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
ere
he
could
raise
it
to
fire
,
a
bullet
struck
him
in
the
throat
.
<EOS>
He
staggered
back
,
and
a
few
moments
later
was
a
corpse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Undaunted
,
however
,
my
men
determined
to
sell
their
lives
as
dearly
as
possible
,
and
continued
their
fire
,
time
after
time
repelling
the
attack
,
and
sweeping
away
the
grey
-
coats
as
they
emerged
from
behind
the
low
walls
.
 
<EOS>
"
Three
more
men
had
fallen
in
as
many
seconds
,
and
another
,
staggering
back
against
the
wall
,
held
his
hand
to
his
breast
,
where
he
had
received
a
terrible
and
mortal
wound
.
<EOS>
Our
situation
at
that
moment
was
most
critical
.
<EOS>
Only
two
rounds
remained
to
each
of
my
nine
brave
fellows
,
yet
not
a
man
wavered
.
 
<EOS>
"
Looking
,
I
saw
in
the
fading
twilight
the
dark
masses
of
the
enemy
moving
up
the
steep
road
,
and
at
that
moment
a
round
was
fired
with
effect
upon
those
who
had
surrounded
us
.
<EOS>
One
more
round
only
remained
.
<EOS>
Then
we
meant
to
die
fighting
.
<EOS>
Blinding
smoke
suddenly
filled
the
half
-
wrecked
room
,
and
we
knew
that
the
enemy
had
succeeded
in
setting
fire
to
the
taproom
underneath
!
 
<EOS>
"
I
stepped
forward
,
and
shouted
for
the
last
time
the
order
to
my
brave
comrades
to
fire
.
<EOS>
Nine
rifles
rang
out
simultaneously
;
but
I
had
,
I
suppose
,
showed
myself
imprudently
,
for
<EOS>
at
the
same
second
I
felt
a
sharp
twinge
in
the
shoulder
,
and
knew
that
I
had
been
struck
.
<EOS>
The
rest
was
all
a
blank
.
 
<EOS>
"
When
I
regained
my
senses
I
found
myself
lying
in
Sandwell
Hall
,
with
doctors
bandaging
my
wounds
,
and
then
I
learned
that
we
had
been
rescued
just
in
time
,
and
that
my
nine
comrades
had
all
escaped
the
fate
they
had
faced
with
dogged
disregard
for
their
own
safety
,
and
such
noble
devotion
to
their
Queen
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
black
day
for
Britain
.
<EOS>
During
the
long
hours
of
that
fierce
,
mad
struggle
many
Victoria
Crosses
were
earned
,
but
the
majority
of
those
who
performed
deeds
worthy
of
such
decoration
,
alas
!
<EOS>
fell
to
the
earth
,
dead

CHAPTER
XX
.
 
<EOS>
OUR
REVENGE
IN
THE
MEDITERRANEAN
.
  
<EOS>
Many
important
events
had
occurred
in
the
Mediterranean
since
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
of
the
sudden
Declaration
of
War
,
the
ships
forming
the
British
Mediterranean
Squadron
were
at
Larnaka
,
Cyprus
,
and
on
receipt
of
the
alarming
intelligence
,
the
Admiral
sailed
immediately
for
Malta
.
<EOS>
On
arrival
there
,
he
heard
that
a
strong
force
of
French
vessels
had
been
despatched
to
Gibraltar
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
any
British
ships
from
getting
out
of
the
Mediterranean
in
order
to
strengthen
the
Channel
Squadron
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
he
waited
for
some
days
at
Malta
,
in
hourly
expectation
of
instructions
,
which
came
at
length
about
two
o'clock
one
morning
,
and
an
hour
later
the
Squadron
sailed
westward
for
an
unknown
destination
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Fleet
in
those
waters
was
notoriously
inadequate
in
comparison
with
those
of
France
and
Russia
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
three
of
the
battleships
constructed
under
the
1894
programme
,
the
_
Jupiter
_
,
_
Caesar
_
,
and
_
Victorious
_
,
with
the
cruisers
_
Diana
_
and
_
Dido
_
;
the
ironclads
_
Collingwood
_
,
_
Dreadnought
_
,
_
Hood
_
,
_
Inflexible
_
,
_
Nile
_
,
_
Ramillies
_
,
_
Repulse
_
,
<EOS>
_
Sans
Pareil
_
,
_
Trafalgar
_
,
_
Magnificent
_
,
_
Empress
of
India
_
,
and
_
Revenge
_
;
the
cruisers
_
Arethusa
_
,
_
Edgar
_
,
_
Fearless
_
,
<EOS>
_
Hawke
_
,
_
Scout
_
,

Orlando
_
,
_
Undaunted
_
<EOS>
;
the
torpedo
ram
_
Polyphemus
_
;
the
torpedo
gun
-
vessel
_
Sandfly
_
;
the
sloops
_
Dolphin
_
,
_
Gannet
_
,
_
Melita
_
,
and
_
Bramble
_
;
and
the
despatch
vessel
_
Surprise
_
,
with
twenty
-
two
torpedo
boats
and
six
destroyers
.
 
<EOS>
The
information
received
by
our
Fleet
at
Malta
was
to
the
effect
that
the
French
force
at
Gibraltar
was
so
strong
that
a
successful
attack
was
out
of
the
question
;
while
the
Russian
Mediterranean
and
Black
Sea
Fleets
,
the
strength
of
which
was
considerable
,
were
also
known
to
be
approaching
for
the
purpose
of
co
-
operating
with
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
addition
of
three
new
battleships
and
two
new
cruisers
to
our
force
in
the
Mediterranean
,
the
utter
inadequacy
of
our
Navy
was
still
very
apparent
.
<EOS>
For
years
the
British
public
had
demanded
that
a
dozen
more
new
battleships
should
be
constructed
in
case
of
casualties
,
but
these
demands
were
unheeded
,
and
during
the
three
years
that
had
passed
we
had
lost
our
naval
supremacy
,
for
<EOS>
France
and
Russia
combined
were
now
considerably
stronger
.
<EOS>
France
alone
had
150
fighting
pennants
available
along
her
southern
shores
,
against
our
59
;
and
the
Tsar
's
ships
were
all
strong
,
well
-
equipped
,
and
armed
with
guns
of
the
latest
type
.
 
<EOS>
As
was
feared
from
the
outset
,
the
Russian
Black
Sea
Fleet
had
struck
for
the
Suez
Canal
,
England
's
highway
to
the
East
.
<EOS>
Egypt
,
the
Bosphorus
,
Gibraltar
,
and
Tripoli
in
the
grasp
of
the
enemy
,
meant
supremacy
in
the
East
,
and
a
situation
that
would
not
be
tolerated
by
either
Italy
or
Austria
.
<EOS>
Therefore
the
British
Admiral
,
recognising
the
seriousness
of
the
situation
,
and
having
received
instructions
to
return
home
and
assist
in
the
defence
of
Britain
,
mustered
his
forces
and
cleared
for
action
.
<EOS>
The
events
that
occurred
immediately
afterwards
are
best
related
in
the
graphic
and
interesting
narrative
which
was
subsequently
written
to
a
friend
by
Captain
Neville
Reed
of
the
great
steel
battleship
_
Ramillies
_
,
and
afterwards
published
,
together
with
the
accompanying
sketch
,
in
the
_
Illustrated
London
News
_
,
as
follows:--
 
<EOS>
"
After
leaving
Malta
,
we
rounded
the
Adventure
Bank
off
the
Sicilian
coast
,
and
headed
due
north
past
Elba
and
on
to
the
Gulf
of
Genoa
.
<EOS>
From
Spezia
we
received
despatches
,
and
after
anchoring
for
twelve
hours,--during
which
time
we
were
busy
completing
our
preparations,--sailed
at
midnight
westward
.
<EOS>
Off
St.
Tropez
,
near
the
Hyeres
Islands
,
in
obedience
to
signals
from
the
flagship
,
the
_
Empress
of
India
<EOS>
_
,
the
ironclads
_
Jupiter
_
,
_
Sans
Pareil
_
,
_
Repulse
_
,
with
the
cruisers
_
Edgar
_
,
_
Dido
_
,
_
Diana
_
,
_
Orlando
_
,
_
Undaunted
_
,
and
_
Scout
_
,
the
sloop
_
Gannet
_
,
and
five
torpedo
boats
,
detached
themselves
from
the
Squadron
,
and
after
exchanging
further
signals
,
bore
away
due
south
.
<EOS>
Giving
the
shore
a
wide
offing
,
we
steamed
along
throughout
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
Mediterranean
had
not
yet
been
the
scene
of
any
bloody
or
fatal
conflict
,
but
as
we
cut
our
way
through
the
calm
sunlit
waters
with
a
brilliant
cerulean
sky
above
,
the
contrast
between
our
bright
and
lovely
surroundings
and
the
terrible
realities
of
the
situation
during
those
breathless
hours
of
suspense
still
dwells
distinctly
in
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
our
duty
to
fight
the
enemy
,
to
beat
him
,
and
to
pass
through
the
Straits
of
Gibraltar
and
help
our
comrades
at
home
.
<EOS>
Every
man
,
although
totally
unaware
of
his
present
destination
,
felt
that
at
last
the
moment
had
come
when
the
supreme
ambition
of
his
life
was
to
be
realised
,
and
he
was
to
strike
a
blow
for
his
country
's
honour
.
 
<EOS>
"
Apparently
our
Admiral
was
in
no
hurry
.
<EOS>
He
no
doubt
was
awaiting
events
,
for
at
sunset
we
lay
-
to
about
thirty
miles
south
of
La
Ciotat
,
and
spent
the
calm
bright
night
restlessly
anxious
and
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
hush
of
expectation
over
the
ship
,
and
scarcely
a
sound
broke
the
quiet
save
the
lapping
of
the
water
against
the
smooth
sides
of
the
ironclad
,
and
no
sign
of
force
except
the
swish
of
the
waves
falling
on
either
side
of
the
formidable
and
deadly
ram
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
after
seven
bells
in
the
morning
watch
,
however
,
we
resumed
our
voyage
,
and
turning
,
went
north
again
.
<EOS>
Then
,
for
the
first
time
,
we
knew
the
Admiral
's
intentions
.
<EOS>
An
ultimatum
had
already
been
given
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
We
were
to
bombard
Marseilles
!
<EOS>
_
 
<EOS>
"
Three
hours
later
we
came
within
view
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Seen
from
the
sea
it
has
a
certain
amount
of
picturesqueness
.
<EOS>
In
the
foreground
there
is
the
harbour
,
with
a
barren
group
of
islands
at
its
entrance
,
and
behind
masses
of
yellow
houses
covering
an
extensive
valley
,
and
white
villas
dotted
over
a
semicircle
of
green
hills
stretching
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Prominent
in
the
landscape
is
the
church
of
Notre
Dame
de
la
Garde
,
perched
on
the
eminence
on
the
right
;
while
on
the
left
there
stands
on
an
island
the
Chateau
d'If
,
rendered
immortal
by
the
adventures
of
Monte
Cristo
;
and
behind
,
on
the
broad
Quai
de
la
Joliette
,
rises
the
fine
Cathedral
,
built
in
alternate
courses
of
black
and
white
stone
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
handsome
and
wealthy
city
,
with
its
fine
shady
boulevard
,
the
Cannebiere
running
through
its
centre
from
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
right
down
to
the
old
port
<EOS>
whence
<EOS>
the
mail
steamers
depart
.
<EOS>
This
city
,
teeming
with
life
,
it
was
our
duty
to
lay
in
ruins
!
 
<EOS>
"
Knowing
how
strongly
fortified
it
was
,
that
upon
each
of
those
hills
were
great
batteries
ready
at
a
given
signal
to
pour
out
their
deadly
hail
,
and
that
under
the
blue
waters
were
mines
which
might
be
exploded
from
the
shore
at
any
moment
,
we
made
preparations
for
counter
-
mining
,
and
then
cautiously
approached
within
range
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
however
,
having
got
into
position
and
laid
our
guns
,
we
received
the
anxiously
expected
order
,
and
a
few
moments
later
opened
a
terrific
and
almost
simultaneous
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
Through
my
glass
I
could
clearly
distinguish
the
terrible
confusion
being
caused
in
the
streets
as
our
shells
fell
and
burst
on
the
Quai
de
la
Joliette
,
in
the
Cannebiere
,
and
the
Boulevard
de
l'Empereur
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
first
taste
of
our
guns
had
produced
a
terrible
panic
,
for
a
shell
from
the
_
Dreadnought
_
,
lying
next
to
us
,
had
struck
the
tower
of
the
Cathedral
and
brought
down
a
great
quantity
of
masonry
,
while
another
shell
from
one
of
our
67-ton
guns
,
bursting
in
the
Palais
de
Justice
with
terrible
effect
,
had
ignited
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
our
first
shot
,
and
the
gun
had
been
well
sighted
;
but
ere
we
fired
again
such
a
storm
of
shell
burst
upon
us
that
I
confess
for
a
moment
I
stood
in
my
conning
-
tower
motionless
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
On
all
sides
the
French
had
apparently
established
batteries
.
<EOS>
From
the
great
Fort
St.
Jean
at
the
entrance
to
the
port
,
and
from
the
Batterie
du
Phare
on
the
opposite
side
,
flame
and
smoke
belched
from
heavy
guns
continuously
.
<EOS>
From
a
small
battery
in
the
Chateau
d'If
,
from
another
on
the
rocky
promontory
on
the
right
known
as
the
Edoume
,
from
a
number
of
smaller
ones
established
on
the
hills
of
l'Oriol
and
the
Citadel
,
as
well
as
from
the
great
fortress
of
Notre
Dame
de
la
Garde
on
the
highest
hill
,
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
city
,
there
came
an
incessant
thunder
,
and
dozens
of
shots
ricochetted
over
the
placid
water
towards
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
moments
,
however
,
my
67-tonners
were
again
adding
to
the
deafening
roar
,
my
ten
6-inch
quick
-
firing
guns
were
sending
out
their
messengers
of
death
,
and
my
smaller
arms
,
consisting
of
3
and
16-pounders
,
were
acting
their
part
in
the
sudden
outburst
.
<EOS>
We
had
attacked
the
town
without
intention
of
investment
,
but
simply
to
destroy
it
,
and
as
the
minutes
slipped
by
,
and
I
peered
through
my
glass
,
I
could
see
how
devastating
were
our
enormous
modern
shells
.
 
<EOS>
"
All
our
guns
were
now
trained
upon
the
forts
,
and
the
bombardment
was
most
vigorous
.
<EOS>
The
six
coast
-
defence
ships
,
which
endeavoured
to
drive
us
off
,
we
quickly
put
out
of
action
,
capturing
one
,
torpedoing
two
,
and
disabling
the
three
others
;
while
up
to
the
present
,
although
a
number
of
shots
from
the
land
batteries
had
struck
us
,
we
sustained
no
serious
damage
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
were
avenging
Hull
and
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
Into
the
panic
-
stricken
town
we
were
pouring
an
unceasing
storm
of
shell
,
which
swept
away
whole
streets
of
handsome
buildings
,
and
killed
hundreds
of
those
flying
for
safety
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
Watching
,
I
saw
one
shot
from
one
of
my
bow
barbette
guns
crash
into
the
roof
of
the
fine
new
Hotel
du
Louvre
,
in
the
Cannebiere
.
<EOS>
The
French
Tricolor
on
the
flagstaff
toppled
over
into
the
street
,
and
a
second
later
the
clouds
of
smoke
and
the
debris
which
shot
up
showed
plainly
the
awful
results
of
the
bursting
shell
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
after
time
my
67-tonners
crashed
and
roared
,
<EOS>
time
after
time
I
pressed
my
fingers
upon
the
little
knobs
in
the
conning
-
tower
,
and
huge
projectiles
were
discharged
right
into
the
forts
.
<EOS>
In
conjunction
with
the
never
-
ceasing
fire
of
companion
ships
,
we
rained
iron
in
a
continuous
stream
that
wrought
havoc
in
the
defences
and
destroyed
all
the
buildings
that
offered
targets
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
the
Arsenal
behind
the
Palais
de
Justice
was
laid
in
ruins
,
the
fine
Hotel
de
Ville
was
a
mere
heap
of
smouldering
debris
,
the
Bourse
,
and
the
great
Library
in
the
Boulevard
du
Musee
were
half
wrecked
by
shells
,
and
the
Custom
House
,
the
Gendarmerie
,
and
the
Prefecture
were
burning
furiously
.
<EOS>
The
Chateau
du
Phare
on
the
headland
at
the
entrance
to
the
fort
was
suffering
frightfully
,
and
the
shells
that
had
struck
the
Citadel
and
the
fort
of
Notre
Dame
had
been
terribly
effective
.
<EOS>
Every
part
of
the
city
from
the
Promenade
du
Prado
to
the
Botanical
Gardens
was
being
swept
continuously
by
our
fire
,
and
from
the
black
smoke
curling
upward
in
the
sunlight
we
knew
that
many
broad
handsome
streets
were
in
flames
.
<EOS>
Excited
over
their
work
of
revenge
,
my
guns
'
crews
worked
on
with
a
contemptuous
disregard
for
the
withering
fire
being
poured
upon
us
from
the
land
.
<EOS>
They
meant
,
they
said
,
to
teach
the
Frenchmen
a
lesson
,
and
they
certainly
did
.
<EOS>
Around
us
shots
from
the
batteries
fell
thickly
,
sending
up
huge
columns
of
water
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
shell
struck
the
_
Ramillies
_
forward
in
front
of
the
barbette
,
and
burst
like
the
rending
of
a
thundercloud
.
<EOS>
The
deck
was
torn
up
,
a
dozen
men
were
maimed
or
killed
,
poor
fellows
!
<EOS>
but
the
solid
face
of
the
barbette
held
its
own
,
and
the
muzzles
of
our
two
great
guns
remained
untouched
.
 
<EOS>
"
Several
shots
from
the
Notre
Dame
Fort
and
the
Endoume
Battery
then
struck
us
in
quick
succession
.
<EOS>
One
was
particularly
disastrous
,
for
,
crashing
into
the
battery
on
the
port
side
,
it
burst
,
disabling
one
of
the
6-inch
guns
,
and
killing
the
whole
gun
's
crew
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
frightful
,
for
the
whole
space
around
was
wrecked
,
and
not
a
man
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
"
Such
are
the
fortunes
of
war
!
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
we
turned
our
heavy
guns
upon
the
Endoume
Battery
,
perched
up
upon
the
rocky
headland
,
and
together
with
the
_
Empress
of
India
_
and
the
_
Victorious
_
<EOS>
thundered
forth
our
great
projectiles
upon
it
in
a
manner
which
must
have
been
terribly
disconcerting
.
<EOS>
The
battery
replied
vigorously
at
first
,
but
the
_
Nile
_
,
noticing
the
direction
in
which
we
had
turned
our
attention
,
trained
her
guns
upon
the
same
fort
,
and
let
loose
a
perfect
hail
of
devastating
shell
.
<EOS>
Without
ceasing
for
a
second
,
we
played
upon
it
,
and
could
distinguish
even
with
the
naked
eye
how
completely
we
were
destroying
it
,
until
half
an
hour
later
we
found
that
the
Frenchmen
had
ceased
to
reply
.
<EOS>
We
had
silenced
their
guns
,
and
,
in
fact
,
totally
wrecked
the
fort
.
 
<EOS>
"
Several
of
our
vessels
were
,
however
,
severely
feeling
the
fire
from
the
Notre
Dame
Fortress
and
that
of
St.
Jean
.
<EOS>
Nearly
one
hundred
men
on
board
<EOS>
the
_
Trafalgar
_
had
been
killed
;
while
two
shots
,
entering
one
of
the
broadside
batteries
of
the
flagship
,
had
caused
frightful
havoc
,
and
had
blown
to
atoms
over
forty
men
and
three
officers
.
<EOS>
A
torpedo
boat
that
had
approached
the
French
coast
-
defence
ship
just
before
she
was
captured
had
been
sunk
by
a
shot
,
but
the
crew
were
fortunately
all
rescued
,
after
much
difficulty
,
by
the
sloop
_
Dolphin
_
,
which
had
severely
suffered
herself
from
the
vigorous
fire
from
the
Batterie
du
Phare
.
<EOS>
The
funnel
of
the
_
Nile
_
had
been
carried
away
by
a
shot
from
the
Citadel
,
while
among
the
more
conspicuous
British
losses
was
a
serious
catastrophe
which
had
occurred
on
board
the
_
Hood
_
by
the
premature
explosion
of
a
torpedo
,
by
which
a
sub
-
lieutenant
and
thirty
-
three
men
were
launched
into
eternity
,
and
sixteen
men
very
severely
wounded
.
<EOS>
The
engines
of
the
_
Arethusa
_
were
also
broken
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
smoke
rising
from
the
bombarded
city
increased
every
moment
in
density
,
and
even
in
the
daylight
we
could
distinguish
the
flames
.
<EOS>
The
centre
of
Marseilles
was
burning
furiously
,
and
the
fire
was
now
spreading
unchecked
.
<EOS>
One
of
our
objects
had
been
to
destroy
the
immense
quantity
of
war
stores
,
and
in
this
we
were
entirely
successful
.
<EOS>
We
had
turned
our
united
efforts
upon
the
Fort
St.
Jean
down
at
the
harbour
entrance
and
that
of
Notre
Dame
high
on
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Pounding
away
at
these
,
time
slipped
by
until
the
sun
sank
in
a
blaze
of
crimson
and
gold
.
<EOS>
Both
forts
made
a
gallant
defence
,
but
each
of
our
shots
went
home
,
and
through
my
glasses
I
watched
the
awful
result
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
terrific
report
caused
the
whole
city
to
tremble
.
<EOS>
One
of
our
shots
had
apparently
entered
the
powder
magazine
in
the
Fort
St.
Jean
,
and
it
had
blown
up
,
producing
an
appalling
catastrophe
from
which
the
fortress
could
never
recover
.

"
By
this
time
the
whole
of
the
shipping
in
the
docks
was
burning
furiously
,
and
the
congested
part
of
the
city
lying
between
the
port
and
the
Lyons
Railway
Station
was
like
a
huge
furnace
.
<EOS>
The
sight
was
one
of
terrible
grandeur
.
 
<EOS>
"
Presently
,
just
as
the
sun
sank
behind
the
grey
night
clouds
,
we
ceased
fire
,
and
then
gazed
with
calm
satisfaction
upon
the
result
of
our
bombardment
.
<EOS>
We
had
treated
a
French
city
in
the
same
manner
as
the
French
and
Russians
had
treated
our
own
homes
,
and
we
could
look
upon
this
scene
of
destruction
and
death
without
a
pang
of
remorse
.
<EOS>
But
that
was
not
all
.
<EOS>
When
our
guns
were
silent
we
could
distinctly
hear
vigorous
rifle
firing
at
the
back
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Then
we
knew
the
truth
.
 
<EOS>
"
While
we
had
been
attacking
Marseilles
from
the
sea
,
the
Italians
,
who
a
week
before
had
crossed
the
frontier
,
and
with
the
Germans
occupied
Lyons
,
had
co
-
operated
with
us
on
land
,
and
the
terror
-
stricken
Marseillais
,
hemmed
in
by
fire
and
bullets
on
either
side
,
had
been
swept
away
in
thousands
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
scenes
in
the
streets
were
,
we
afterwards
learnt
,
awful
;
and
although
the
garrison
offered
a
desperate
resistance
to
the
Italians
along
the
valley
near
the
Chateau
des
Fleurs
,
most
of
them
were
killed
,
and
nearly
three
thousand
of
their
number
taken
prisoners
.
<EOS>
But
the
Italians
were
unable
to
enter
Marseilles
themselves
,
as
,
long
before
they
had
succeeded
in
breaking
up
the
land
defences
,
we
had
set
the
place
on
fire
,
and
now
,
as
night
fell
,
the
great
city
was
one
mass
of
flames
,
the
lurid
light
from
which
illuminated
sky
and
sea
with
a
bright
red
glare
.

The
blazing
African
sun
was
fading

flooding
the
calm
sapphire
Mediterranean
with
its
blood
-
red
afterglow

<EOS>
The
air
was
oppressive
,
the
wind
blew
hot
from
the
desert
,
and
shoals
of
tiny
green
birds
were
chattering
before
roosting
in
the
oasis
of
tall
date
palms
that
cast
long
shadows
over
the
sun

baked
stones
of
the
Place

Everything
was
of
a
dazzling
whiteness
,
relieved
only
by
the
blue
sky
and
sea
.
<EOS>
The
broad
,
handsome
Square
was
almost
deserted
,
the
jalousies
of
the
European
houses
were
still
closed
,
and
although
a
few
people
were
sipping
absinthe
at
the
cafes
,
the
siesta
was
not
yet
over
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
corner
of
the
Square
the
Mosque
of
Djama
-
el

Djedid
,
with
its
dome
and
minarets
,
stood
out
intensely
white
against
the
bright
,
cloudless
sky
,
its
spotless
cleanliness
causing
the
white
-
washed
houses
of
Europeans
to
appear
yellow
and
dingy
;
and
as
the
_

stood
on
one
of
the
minarets
with
arms
uplifted
,
calling
the
Faithful
to
prayer
,
idle
Moors

Arabs
,
who
had
been
lying
asleep
in
the
shadow
during
the
afternoon
,
rose
quickly
,
rearranged
their
burnouses
,
and
entered
the
Mosque
in
order
to
render
thanks
to
Allah

Darkness
crept
on
after
a
brief
twilight

Moorish
women
,
wrapped
in
their
white
_

,
wearing
their
ugly
baggy
trousers
,
and
veiled
to
the
eyes
,
waddled
along
slowly
and
noiselessly
among
the
palms
,
and
gradually
a
gay
cosmopolitan
crowd
assembled
in
the
Place
to
enjoy
the
_

_
after
the
terrible
heat
of
the
day
,
and
to
listen
to
the
fine
band
of
the
1st
Zouaves
,
which
had
already
taken
up
its
stand
in
the
centre
of
the
Square
,
and
was
now
playing
one
of
Strauss

dreamy
waltzes
.
 
<EOS>
The
night
was
bright
and
starlit
,
one
of
those
calm
,
mystic
evenings
peculiar
to
North
Africa
.
<EOS>
All
was
peaceful
,
but
no
moon
had
yet
risen
.
<EOS>
The
city
wore
its
gay
air
of
carelessness
.
<EOS>
White
-
robed
Moors
and
red
-
fezzed
Arabs
,
negroes
from
the
Soudan
,
and
Biskris
in
their
blue
burnouses
,
lounged
,
chattered
,
and
promenaded
,
while
the
cafes
and
bazaars
around
were
full
of
life
,
and
<EOS>
the
warm
,
balmy
air
was
laden
with
the
scent
of
flowers
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
without
warning
,
the
whole
place
was
illuminated
by
a
brilliant
light
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Slowly
it
swept
the
town
,
and
a
few
seconds
later
other
bright
beams
shot
forth
,
lighting
up
the
quays
,
the
terraces
of
white
,
flat
-
roofed
houses
,
and
the
Moorish
city
on
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Then
,
before
the
promenaders
could
realise
the
cause
,
a
loud
booming
was
heard
at
sea
,
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
shell
fell
,
and
,
exploding
in
the
midst
of
them
,
blew
a
dozen
Moors
and
Arabs
into
atoms
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
the
cannonade
increased
,
and
the
battery
in
the
centre
of
the
harbour
replied
.
<EOS>
Then
firing
seemed
to
proceed
from
all
quarters
,
and
a
storm
of
shell
suddenly
crashed
upon
the
town
with
the
most
appalling
effect
.
 
<EOS>
British
war
-
vessels
had
crept
up
within
range
,
and
were
pouring
the
vials
of
Britain
's
wrath
upon
the
ancient
city
of
the
Deys
!
 
<EOS>
The
detachment
of
vessels
which
,
led
by
the
new
battleship
_
Jupiter
_
,
went
south
from
St.
Tropez
,
had
received
instructions
to
destroy
Algiers
and
return
with
all
speed
to
Cagliari
,
in
Sardinia
,
to
await
further
instructions
.
<EOS>
The
bombardment
of
the
two
cities
simultaneously
was
in
order
to
draw
off
the
French
Squadron
from
the
position
it
had
taken
up
near
Gibraltar
,
so
that
the
British
could
fight
and
then
run
past
them
into
the
Atlantic
.
 
<EOS>
How
far
the
manoeuvre
succeeded
is
shown
in
the
few
interesting
details
of
the
bombardment
given
in
the
course
of
an
interview
which
a
reporter
of
the
_
Daily
Telegraph
_
had
with
Lieut
.
<EOS>
George
Ingleton
,
of
the
first
-
class
cruiser
_
Edgar
_
.
<EOS>
The
officer
<EOS>
said:--
 
<EOS>
"
We
arrived
off
Algiers
two
hours
after
sundown
,
and
after
an
inspection
with
search
-
lights
,
began
to
let
fly
with
our
big
guns
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
the
Al
-
Djefna
Battery
in
the
centre
of
the
harbour
replied
,
and
a
moment
later
a
very
rigorous
fire
was
poured
forth
from
Fort
Neuf
on
the
right
and
Forts
Bab
-
Azzoun
and
Conde
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
All
four
were
very
strong
,
and
in
conjunction
with
coast
-
defence
vessels
offered
a
most
vigorous
resistance
.
<EOS>
So
suddenly
did
we
fire
upon
the
town
,
that
a
frightful
panic
must
have
been
caused
.
<EOS>
Before
we
had
fired
half
a
dozen
times
,
a
shot
from
one
of
our
22-tonners
crashed
into
the
dome
of
the
Mosque
and
totally
demolished
it
,
while
another
particularly
well
-
aimed
shell
struck
the
Mairie
,
a
big
handsome
building
on
the
Boulevard
de
la
Republique
,
facing
the
sea
,
tearing
out
a
portion
of
the
front
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
our
guns
upon
the
long
row
of
shops
,
banks
,
and
hotels
which
formed
the
Boulevard
,
we
pounded
away
most
effectively
,
while
several
of
our
other
vessels
attended
to
the
forts
.
 
<EOS>
"
During
the
first
half
-
hour
the
four
warships
of
the
enemy
gave
us
considerable
trouble
,
but
very
soon
our
torpedoes
had
sunk
two
of
them
,
and
the
other
two
were
quickly
captured
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
,
under
the
hot
fire
from
the
forts
,
the
bombardment
grew
exciting
.
<EOS>
Shells
were
ricochetting
on
the
water
all
round
us
,
but
our
search
-
lights
being
now
shut
off
,
we
offered
a
very
indistinct
target
to
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
On
nearly
all
our
ships
,
however
,
there
were
some
slight
casualties
.
<EOS>
A
shell
severely
damaged
the
superstructure
of
the
_
Jupiter
_
,
while
others
rendered
useless
several
of
her
machine
guns
.
<EOS>
A
shell
penetrated
the
_
Gannet
_
,
unfortunately
killing
fourteen
bluejackets
;
and
had
it
not
been
that
the
deck
of
the
_
Edgar
_
was
protected
throughout
,
the
consequences
to
us
would
also
have
been
very
serious
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
our
two
22-ton
guns
rendered
valuable
service
,
and
contributed
in
no
small
measure
to
the
demolition
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
the
outset
we
could
see
that
Algiers
was
totally
unprepared
for
attack
,
and
,
continuing
our
fire
calmly
and
regularly
,
we
watched
the
flames
bursting
forth
in
every
part
of
the
town
and
leaping
skyward
.
<EOS>
On
shore
the
guns
kept
up
their
roaring
thunder
,
although
by
aid
of
glasses
we
could
detect
how
effectual
were
our
shells
in
wrecking
the
fortifications
and
laying
in
ruins
the
European
quarter
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
we
were
dealing
terrible
blows
which
shook
the
city
to
its
foundations
.
<EOS>
The
formidable
city
walls
availed
them
nothing
,
for
we
could
drop
our
shells
anywhere
we
pleased
,
either
on
the
hill
at
Mustapha
or
upon
the
pretty
Moorish
villas
that
lined
the
shore
at
St.
Eugene
.
 
<EOS>
"
Blazing
away
at
long
range
upon
the
town
,
we
spread
destruction
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Houses
toppled
like
packs
of
cards
,
mosques
were
blown
into
the
air
,
and
public
buildings
swept
away
like
grains
of
sand
before
the
sirocco
.
<EOS>
Under
such
a
fire
thousands
of
natives
and
Europeans
must
have
perished
,
for
we
were
determined
to
carry
out
our
intentions
,
and
teach
the
invaders
a
lesson
they
were
not
likely
to
easily
forget
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
our
heavy
guns
crashed
,
while
our
6-inch
quick
-
firers
kept
up
their
roar
,
and
our
machine
guns
rattled
continuously
.
<EOS>
As
the
hours
went
by
,
and
we
continued
our
work
of
merciless
destruction
,
we
were
hit
once
or
twice
,
but
beyond
the
loss
of
two
men
and
some
unimportant
damage
we
escaped
further
punishment
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
roar
of
our
guns
was
deafening
,
and
the
smoke
hung
over
the
calm
sea
like
a
storm
-
cloud
.
<EOS>
Still
we
kept
on
in
the
face
of
the
galling
fire
from
the
shore
,
and
before
midnight
had
the
satisfaction
of
witnessing
a
magnificent
spectacle
,
for
the
isolated
conflagrations
gradually
united
and
the
whole
town
was
in
flames
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
accomplished
our
work
,
so
with
cheers
for
Old
England
we
gave
a
parting
shot
,
and
turning
were
soon
steaming
away
towards
the
Sicilian
coast
,
leaving
Algiers
a
mass
of
roaring
flame
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
journey
was
uneventful
until
just
before
noon
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
I
was
at
that
time
on
duty
,
and
suddenly
,
to
my
surprise
,
detected
a
number
of
ships
.
<EOS>
By
the
aid
of
our
glasses
,
the
captain
and
I
found
to
our
dismay
that
a
number
of
the
most
powerful
vessels
of
the
Russian
Fleet
were
bearing
down
upon
us
!
<EOS>
All
our
other
vessels
had
made
the
same
discovery
,
and
I
must
confess
that
the
meeting
was
somewhat
disconcerting
.
<EOS>
The
strength
of
the
Russian
ironclads
was
such
as
to
cause
our
hearts
to
beat
more
quickly
.
<EOS>
To
engage
that
great
force
meant
certain
defeat
,
while
it
was
necessary
that
our
Admiral
off
Marseilles
should
know
of
the
whereabouts
of
this
hostile
squadron
,
therefore
we
resolved
to
get
away
.
<EOS>
But
although
we
altered
our
course
and
put
on
all
speed
,
we
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
At
last
we
determined
at
all
hazards
to
stick
to
our
guns
so
long
as
we
were
afloat
,
and
as
the
first
of
the
Tsar
's
ironclads
drew
within
range
,
one
of
our
22-tonners
thundered
.
<EOS>
The
white
smoke
,
driven
forward
,
tumbled
over
our
bows
.
<EOS>
We
had
spoken
the
first
word
of
battle
!

<EOS>
A
NAVAL
FIGHT
AND
ITS
CONSEQUENCES
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
great
naval
force
of
the
Tsar
,
with
which
we
were
now
face
to
face
,
"
continued
Lieutenant
Ingleton
in
his
narrative
,
"
consisted
of
the
new
battleship
_
Petropavlovsk
_
of
10,960
tons
,
with
a
speed
of
17
knots
;
the
great
turret
-
ship
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
_
of
8076
tons
;
the
two
new
barbette
-
ships
_
Kama
_
and
_
Vologda
_
of
the
_
Cizoi
Veliky
_
type
;
the
_
Tchesme
_
of
10,181
tons
,
the
_
Gheorghy
Pobyednosets
_
of
10,280
tons
,
and
the
powerful
_
Tria
Sviatitelia
_
of
12,480
tons
;
the
two
enormous
new
cruisers
_
Tiumen
_
and
_
Minsk
_
,
both
of
17,000
tons
,
and
running
at
20
knots
;
the
_
Vladimir
Monomach
_
of
5754
tons
;
the
armoured
gunboat
_
Otvazny
_
,
and
the
new
rams
_
Admiral
Seniavine
_
and
_
Admiral
Uschakoff
_
,
with
thirty
torpedo
boats
,
including
the
_
Kodor
_
,
_
Reni
_
,
_
Anakria
_
,
and
_
Adler
_
,
<EOS>
the
latter
being
able
to
run
at
27.4
knots
.
 
<EOS>
"
Against
such
a
gigantic
force
as
this
our
small
force
of
vessels
and
torpedo
boats
presented
but
a
sorry
appearance
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
we
had
fired
the
first
shot
,
and
were
now
determined
to
die
rather
than
haul
down
our
colours
.
<EOS>
As
our
guns
thundered
,
those
of
the
_
Jupiter
_
,
_
Repulse
_
,
<EOS>
_
Sans
Pareil
_
,
_
Undaunted
_
,
_
Orlando
_
,
<EOS>
_
Diana
_
,
_
Scout
_
,
and
_
Gannet
_
joined
in
noisy
chorus
.
<EOS>
The
12-inch
guns
in
the
turrets
of
the
_
Petropavlovsk
_
and
the
four
big
guns
in
the
barbettes
of
the
_
Tria
Sviatitelia
<EOS>
_
crashed
out
together
,
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
we
found
ourselves
being
swept
from
stem
to
stern
by
the
enemy
's
shells
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
battleships
were
all
well
armoured
,
and
had
a
much
heavier
shell
fire
than
the
vessels
of
either
France
or
Britain
.
<EOS>
We
were
both
in
columns
of
divisions
in
line
ahead
,
but
from
the
first
moment
of
the
engagement
our
position
was
critical
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
terrific
and
deadly
storm
burst
upon
us
from
the
enemy
's
tops
,
while
his
heavy
guns
kept
up
an
incessant
thunder
.
<EOS>
With
such
an
enormous
force
against
us
,
it
was
apparent
to
every
man
on
board
that
disaster
was
imminent
.
<EOS>
It
had
,
alas
!
<EOS>
never
been
graven
sufficiently
deep
upon
the
public
mind
<EOS>
how
absurdly
weak
we
were
in
the
Mediterranean
.
<EOS>
Here
,
as
in
all
other
squadrons
,
every
grade
of
officer
from
commander
downwards
was
deficient
in
numbers
,
and
the
ships
in
commission
had
for
years
been
so
much
below
their
complement
that
the
work
had
only
been
carried
on
with
great
difficulty
.
<EOS>
Other
ships
at
home
had
been
obliged
to
wait
until
a
sufficient
number
of
merchant
seamen
and
half
-
trained
engine
-
room
staff
could
be
scraped
together
to
provide
the
semblance
of
a
crew
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
successive
British
Governments
of
both
parties
had
subordinated
national
necessities
to
a
desire
to
evade
a
material
increase
in
taxation
,
and
now
at
last
our
Mediterranean
Squadron
were
compelled
to
face
the
inevitable
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
insidious
cunning
and
patient
methods
to
which
the
Russians
resort
in
order
to
attain
their
aims
and
break
their
boundaries
had
once
more
been
illustrated
.
<EOS>
They
had
,
by
dint
of
extraordinary
chicanery
,
secured
absolute
possession
of
the
small
Turkish
peninsula
known
as
Mount
Athos
.
<EOS>
Situated
near
the
entrance
of
the
Gulf
of
Salonica
,
it
was
a
paramount
strategical
position
,
and
its
possessor
was
now
enabled
to
keep
watch
upon
Macedonia
,
and
in
the
meantime
be
very
near
the
Dardanelles
,
and
also
Asia
Minor
.
<EOS>
The
possession
was
accomplished
in
a
curiously
secret
manner
,
showing
to
what
extent
Russian
foresight
and
artifice
is
carried
.
<EOS>
For
years
past
the
_
Societe
Slav
de
Bienfaisance
_
had
been
sending
,
through
a
bank
in
Salonica
,
large
sums
of
money
to
further
the
aim
.
<EOS>
To
the
casual
observer
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
about
this
,
for
the
Russians
had
established
on
the
lofty
heights
several
monasteries
,
converting
the
place
into
a
clerical
settlement
.
<EOS>
This
fact
was
pointed
out
by
the
_
Pall
Mall
Gazette
_
as
far
back
as
1893
,
but
the
British
public
at
that
time
failed
to
detect
any
Russian
intrigue
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gradually
,
however
,
Muscovite
roubles
purchased
the
surrounding
property
,
and
Greek
convents
were
reduced
to
poverty
while
Russian
institutions
flourished
and
increased
.
<EOS>
But
,
strangely
enough
,
the
inmates
of
these
monasteries
were
suddenly
discovered
to
be
mock
clerics
,
and
then
it
was
disclosed
that
under
the
cover
of
monastic
garments
and
robes
were
to
be
found
the
Tsar
's
soldiers
,
performing
a
three
years
'
special
and
specific
military
service
!
 
<EOS>
"
Yet
,
owing
to
the
Sultan
's
weakness
,
to
the
almighty
backsheesh
,
and
to
the
shortsightedness
of
Turkish
statesmen
,
the
Russians
were
not
dislodged
,
but
the
position
was
actually
ceded
to
them
,
with
the
result
that
they
had
now
firmly
established
themselves
where
they
were
enabled
to
counteract
British
action
and
influence
.
<EOS>
A
naval
station
had
been
established
for
their
Mediterranean
Squadron
at
Poros
,
off
the
eastern
coast
of
the
Peloponnesus
,
some
fifteen
miles
due
south
of
the
island
of
AEgina
.
<EOS>
Here
there
were
three
miles
of
deep
water
safe
from
sea
attack
,
with
an
arsenal
and
dockyard
,
on
the
very
weakest
point
along
the
line
of
our
highway
between
England
and
India
!
<EOS>
Such
was
the
manner
in
which
our
power
in
the
Mediterranean
had
been
undermined
!
 
<EOS>
"
There
was
,
however
,
no
time
for
reflection
amid
the
deafening
roar
.
<EOS>
This
Black
Sea
Fleet
that
had
burst
its
bonds
and
passed
through
the
Dardanelles
intended
to
sweep
us
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
notwithstanding
the
terrible
fire
pouring
upon
us
from
these
great
and
powerful
ships
,
each
fully
equipped
with
the
latest
and
most
improved
arms
,
fully
manned
by
well
-
trained
men
,
and
fresh
for
the
fray
,
we
held
our
quarters
,
determined
to
show
the
forces
of
the
Tsar
defiance
.
<EOS>
Even
though
every
man
of
us
might
be
sent
to
an
untimely
grave
,
the
Russian
flag
should
never
surmount
the
White
Ensign
of
Britain
.
<EOS>
We
were
determined
,
so
we
set
our
teeth
,
and
showed
a
firm
and
vigorous
front
to
the
foe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
two
22-tonners
rendered
admirable
service
,
and
the
cannonade
kept
up
from
our
3
and
6-pounder
quick
-
firing
guns
was
playing
havoc
with
the
Russian
<EOS>
belted
cruiser
<EOS>
_
Vladimir
Monomach
_
lying
on
our
port
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
vessel
was
slightly
larger
than
ourselves
,
carrying
much
heavier
armaments
,
including
four
13-ton
guns
,
and
twelve
<EOS>
4-tonners
.
<EOS>
She
was
indeed
a
very
formidable
opponent
,
<EOS>
nevertheless
we
did
our
best
,
and
,
blazing
away
at
close
quarters
,
soon
succeeded
in
silencing
the
starboard
13-tonner
nearest
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
Just
at
this
moment
I
found
we
were
being
attacked
on
the
port
bow
by
the
enormous
new
turret
-
ship
_
Petropavlovsk
_
and
the
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
_
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
heavy
12-inch
guns
of
the
former
thundered
almost
simultaneously
,
and
both
shells
striking
us
almost
amidships
,
caused
us
such
a
shock
that
for
a
second
I
stood
breathless
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
a
few
moments
,
however
,
it
was
reported
that
our
'
vitals
'
had
fortunately
escaped
,
and
we
continued
firing
as
if
no
catastrophe
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
damage
caused
by
those
two
shells
was
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
_
Jupiter
_
,
steaming
about
two
miles
away
on
our
starboard
quarter
,
was
apparently
holding
her
own
against
the
barbette
-
ships
_
Tchesme
_
and
_
Gheorghy
Pobyednosets
_
,
the
cruiser
<EOS>
_
Tiumen
_
,
one
of
the
largest
in
the
world
,
and
the
new
ram
_
Admiral
Seniavine
_
.
<EOS>
The
four
attacking
vessels
,
as
seen
through
the
dense
smoke
,
were
pouring
into
the
British
ship
a
deadly
fire
;
yet
,
judging
from
the
fallen
tops
and
disabled
engines
of
the
_
Gheorghy
Pobyednosets
_
and
the
wrecked
superstructure
of
the
_
Tchesme
_
,
the
_
Jupiter
's
_
heavy
armaments
were
executing
good
work
,
notwithstanding
the
strength
of
the
_
Tchesme
's
_
six
50-ton
guns
,
admirably
arranged
in
pairs
in
the
centre
of
the
vessel
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
_
Diana
_
and
<EOS>
_
Sans
Pareil
_
,
lying
near
to
one
another
,
were
desperately
resisting
the
vigorous
attack
made
by
the
_
Admiral
Uschakoff
_
,
_
Minsk
_
,
_
Otvazny
_
,
_
Kama
_
,
and
_
Vologda
_
;
and
here
again
,
amid
smoke
and
flying
debris
,
I
could
distinguish
that
the
67-tonners
of
the
_
Repulse
_
,
in
co
-
operation
with
the
lighter
weapons
of
the
_
Undaunted
_
,
were
giving
the
enemy
a
taste
of
what
British
courage
could
accomplish
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
sea
around
us
simply
swarmed
with
Russian
torpedo
boats
,
and
it
required
all
our
vigilance
to
evade
their
continued
attacks
.
<EOS>
Before
an
hour
had
passed
we
had
succeeded
in
sinking
two
by
shots
from
our
6-inch
guns
,
and
several
more
were
sent
to
the
bottom
by
well
-
aimed
projectiles
from
the
_
Dido
_
and
_
Jupiter
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
for
ourselves
,
projectiles
were
sweeping
across
our
deck
like
hail
,
and
under
the
incessant
and
fearful
fire
we
were
suffering
frightfully
.
<EOS>
Over
sixty
of
our
men
and
a
sub
-
lieutenant
had
been
killed
,
while
forty
-
nine
were
severely
wounded
.
<EOS>
Once
I
had
occasion
to
go
below
,
and
between
decks
the
sight
that
met
my
gaze
was
awful
.
 
<EOS>
"
Around
two
of
the
quick
-
firing
guns
on
our
port
quarter
lay
the
guns
'
crews
,
mutilated
by
shells
from
the
_
Vladimir
Monomach
_
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
killed
almost
instantly
while
standing
bravely
at
their
posts
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
appalling
.
<EOS>
The
mangled
masses
of
humanity
amid
which
the
surgeons
were
at
work
were
awful
to
look
upon
,
and
I
rushed
up
again
with
the
terrible
scene
photographed
indelibly
upon
my
memory
.
 
<EOS>
"
Meanwhile
the
ship
was
in
the
greatest
peril
.
<EOS>
The
continual
bursting
of
shells
upon
her
shook
and
shattered
her
,
and
she
trembled
violently
as
,
time
after
time
,
her
own
guns
uttered
their
thundering
reply
to
her
enemies
.
<EOS>
Heeling
now
this
way
,
now
that
,
as
the
helm
was
put
hard
over
to
avoid
a
blow
,
the
situation
on
board
was
intensely
exciting
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
were
terrible
moments
.
<EOS>
The
captain
suddenly
noticed
the
movements
of
the
_
Vladimir
Monomach
_
,
and
divined
her
intentions
.
<EOS>
She
had
ceased
firing
,
and
by
a
neatly
executed
manoeuvre
was
preparing
to
ram
us
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
our
helm
was
put
over
again
,
and
the
_
Edgar
_
answered
to
it
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
"
'
Ready
bow
tube
!
'
<EOS>
I
heard
the
captain
shout
hoarsely
.
<EOS>
He
waited
a
few
moments
,
allowing
the
Russian
ironclad
to
partially
perform
her
evolution
,
then
just
as
she
came
almost
into
collision
with
us
he
shrieked
'
Fire
bow
tube
!
'
<EOS>
at
the
same
time
bringing
us
over
further
to
port
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
seconds
seemed
hours
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
was
a
loud
explosion
,
a
great
column
of
water
rose
under
the
Russian
's
bow
,
and
we
knew
the
torpedo
had
struck
.
<EOS>
At
that
moment
,
too
,
even
while
the
water
was
still
in
the
air
,
one
of
our
torpedo
boats
which
had
crept
up
under
the
_
Vladimir
Monomach
's
_
stern
sent
another
torpedo
at
her
,
which
also
hit
its
mark
and
ripped
her
up
.
<EOS>
Turning
our
guns
upon
the
armoured
cruiser
,
we
poured
volley
after
volley
into
her
,
but
she
did
not
reply
,
for
her
men
were
panic
-
stricken
,
and
she
was
sinking
fast
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
_
Petropavlovsk
_
,
leaving
us
,
endeavoured
to
rescue
her
crew
,
but
ere
a
dozen
men
were
saved
,
she
settled
down
bow
foremost
,
and
disappeared
into
the
deep
,
carrying
down
with
her
nearly
five
hundred
officers
and
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
_
kept
up
her
fire
upon
us
,
and
a
few
moments
later
I
witnessed
another
disaster
,
for
a
shot
from
one
of
her
bow
guns
struck
the
torpedo
boat
that
had
just
assisted
us
,
and
sank
it
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
later
a
loud
explosion
in
the
direction
of
the
_
Sans
Pareil
<EOS>
_
attracted
my
attention
,
and
,
turning
<EOS>
,
I
saw
amid
the
smoke
-
clouds
debris
precipitated
high
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
A
shot
from
one
of
her
111-ton
guns
had
penetrated
to
the
magazine
of
the
_
Admiral
Seniavine
_
,
which
had
exploded
,
causing
a
frightful
disaster
on
board
that
vessel
,
and
just
at
the
same
moment
a
cheer
from
the
crew
of
one
of
our
6-inch
guns
prompted
me
to
look
for
the
cause
,
which
I
found
in
the
fact
that
they
had
shot
the
Russian
colours
completely
away
from
the
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
_
.
 
<EOS>
"
Again
another
frightful
explosion
sounded
loud
above
the
incessant
din
,
and
to
my
satisfaction
I
saw
a
great
column
of
water
rise
around
the
_
Admiral
Uschakoff
_
,
which
,
fighting
at
close
quarters
with
the
_
Dido
_
,
had
apparently
been
torpedoed
.
<EOS>
Not
satisfied
with
this
,
the
captain
of
the
_
Dido
_
,
keeping
his
machine
guns
going
,
turned
his
vessel
and
discharged
a
second
Whitehead
,
which
also
struck
with
such
terrible
effect
that
the
Russian
ship
began
at
once
to
sink
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
blue
waves
closed
for
ever
over
her
tops
,
ere
a
score
or
so
out
of
her
crew
of
300
could
be
rescued
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
nearly
three
bells
,
and
the
sun
was
setting
.
<EOS>
A
galling
fire
from
the
machine
guns
in
the
foretop
of
the
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
_
suddenly
swept
our
deck
,
killing
a
dozen
poor
fellows
who
were
at
work
clearing
away
some
debris
,
and
at
the
same
moment
a
shot
from
one
of
her
52-ton
guns
crashed
into
our
port
quarter
,
and
must
have
caused
terrible
havoc
among
the
guns
'
crews
.
<EOS>
A
moment
later
we
were
dismayed
by
the
report
that
our
steering
-
gear
had
been
broken
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
seconds
we
were
helplessly
swinging
round
under
the
awful
fire
which
was
now
pouring
from
the
great
guns
of
the
Russian
ironclad
,
and
our
captain
was
making
strenuous
efforts
to
recover
control
of
the
ship
,
when
I
saw
the
torpedo
boat
<EOS>
_
Anakria
_
shoot
suddenly
across
our
bows
,
then
quickly
slacken
as
she
got
to
starboard
of
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
second
later
I
realised
her
intention
,
and
shouted
frantically
.
<EOS>
A
line
of
bubbles
had
appeared
on
the
surface
advancing
swiftly
towards
us
.
<EOS>
She
had
ejected
a
torpedo
straight
at
us
,
and
I
stood
petrified
,
not
daring
to
breathe
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
moment
later
there
came
a
terrific
explosion
right
underneath
us
,
followed
by
a
harsh
tearing
sound
as
iron
plates
were
torn
asunder
like
tinfoil
,
and
the
ship
's
side
was
ripped
completely
up
.
<EOS>
The
_
Edgar
_
heaved
high
and
plunged
heavily
,
a
great
column
of
water
rose
high
above
her
masts
,
and
the
air
seemed
filled
with
flying
fragments
of
iron
and
wood
.
<EOS>
The
vessel
rocked
and
swayed
so
that
we
could
not
keep
our
feet
,
and
then
gradually
heeling
over
,
causing
her
guns
to
shift
,
she
went
down
before
a
soul
on
board
could
launch
a
boat
.
 
<EOS>
"
At
the
moment
of
the
explosion
I
felt
a
sharp
twinge
in
the
back
,
and
found
that
I
had
been
struck
by
a
flying
splinter
of
steel
.
<EOS>
The
strain
of
those
hours
had
been
terrible
,
and
of
the
events
that
followed
I
can
only
recollect
two
things
.
<EOS>
I
remember
finding
myself
struggling
alone
in
the
water
with
a
shower
of
bullets
from
the
_
Dvenadsat
Apostoloff
's
_
tops
sending
up
little
splashes
about
me
.
<EOS>
Then
I
felt
my
strength
failing
,
my
limbs
seemed
paralysed
,
and
I
could
no
longer
strike
out
to
save
myself
.
<EOS>
Abandoning
all
hope
,
I
was
sinking
,
when
suddenly
a
rope
was
flung
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
remember
how
frantically
I
clutched
it
,
and
that
a
few
moments
later
I
was
hauled
aboard
a
torpedo
boat
;
but
for
days
afterwards
I
lay
hovering
'
twixt
life
and
death
,
oblivious
to
all
.
<EOS>
I
was
one
of
the
thirteen
only
who
were
saved
out
of
a
crew
of
327
brave
officers
and
men
.
"
 
<EOS>
Such
a
ghastly
disaster
could
only
produce
profound
dismay
among
those
who
manned
the
remaining
British
vessels
.
<EOS>
Straining
every
nerve
to
uphold
the
honour
of
Britain
,
the
guns
'
crews
of
the
_
Jupiter
_
,
_
Sans
Pareil
_
,
_
Repulse
_
,
and
_
Undaunted
_
,
with
smoke
-
begrimed
hands
and
faces
,
worked
on
with
that
indomitable
energy
begotten
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Regardless
of
the
awful
rain
of
shot
and
shell
,
they
reloaded
and
fired
with
calm
,
dogged
self
-
possession
,
the
officers
on
all
four
vessels
inspiring
their
men
by
various
deeds
of
valour
,
and
preserving
such
discipline
under
fire
as
none
but
British
sailors
could
.
<EOS>
The
British
naval
officer
is
full
of
undaunted
defiance
and
contempt
for
his
foes
;
but
,
above
all
,
he
is
a
strict
disciplinarian
,
and
to
this
our
country
in
a
great
measure
owes
the
supremacy
our
Navy
has
hitherto
enjoyed
upon
the
seas
.
<EOS>
During
the
fight
the
vessels
had
been
moving
in
a
north
-
easterly
direction
,
and
although
the
Russians
were
unaware
of
the
fact
,
Her
Majesty
's
ships
had
therefore
continued
in
their
course
.
<EOS>
Hence
,
just
as
a
cool
breeze
sprang
up
at
sundown
,
soon
after
the
_
Edgar
_
had
sunk
,
a
line
of
low
dark
cliffs
was
sighted
ahead
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
of
the
_
Diana
_
,
watching
anxiously
through
their
glasses
,
distinguished
the
distant
crest
of
Mount
Genargentu
gradually
appearing
against
the
clear
evening
sky
,
and
then
they
knew
that
they
were
off
Sardinia
,
outside
the
Gulf
of
Oristano
.
 
<EOS>
Altering
their
course
,
they
headed
due
north
,
still
keeping
up
a
running
fire
,
but
the
Russians
prevented
them
making
headway
.
 
<EOS>
All
our
vessels
were
suffering
frightfully
,
when
there
was
a
sudden
explosion
,
and
,
to
the
Englishmen
's
dismay
,
it
was
seen
that
a
torpedo
had
struck
the
_
Undaunted
_
nearly
amidships
.
<EOS>
Still
the
doomed
vessel
managed
to
evade
a
second
attack
,
and
by
a
desperate
manoeuvre
the
captain
succeeded
in
turning
and
heading
for
land
.
 
<EOS>
The
remaining
ships
,
in
their
terribly
crippled
condition
,
would
,
the
Russians
anticipated
,
soon
fall
an
easy
prey
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
with
their
crews
decimated
,
their
guns
disabled
,
and
their
machinery
damaged
,
the
British
vessels
still
continued
firing
,
the
men
resolved
to
go
down
at
their
quarters
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
escape
was
hopeless
,
and
every
moment
they
saw
their
comrades
being
swept
away
by
the
great
exploding
projectiles
of
the
Tsar
's
heavy
guns
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
dismayed
.
<EOS>
To
do
their
utmost
for
the
defence
of
Britain
,
to
keep
afloat
as
long
as
possible
,
and
to
die
like
Britons
with
faces
towards
the
foe
,
was
their
duty
.
<EOS>
Pale
and
desperate
,
they
were
fighting
for
their
country
and
their
Queen
,
knowing
that
only
a
grave
in
the
deep
and
the
honour
of
those
at
home
would
be
the
reward
of
their
bravery
--
that
at
any
moment
they
might
be
launched
into
the
unknown
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
was
a
loud
shouting
on
board
the
_
Jupiter
_
,
and
signals
were
,
a
moment
later
,
run
up
to
her
half
-
wrecked
top
.
<EOS>
The
captain
of
the
_
Dido
_
,
noticing
this
,
looked
to
ascertain
the
cause
,
and
saw
away
on
the
horizon
to
the
north
,
whence
the
dark
night
clouds
were
rising
,
a
number
of
strange
craft
.
<EOS>
Snatching
up
his
glass
,
he
directed
it
on
the
strangers
,
and
discovered
that
they
were
Italian
warships
,
and
were
exchanging
rapid
signals
with
the
captain
.
<EOS>
They
were
promising
assistance
!
 
<EOS>
Cheers
rang
loudly
through
the
British
vessels
,
when
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
the
truth
became
known
,
and
the
guns
'
crews
worked
with
redoubled
energy
,
while
the
Russians
,
noticing
the
approaching
ships
,
were
apparently
undecided
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
They
were
given
but
little
time
for
reflection
,
however
,
for
within
half
an
hour
the
first
of
the
great
Italian
ironclads
,
the
_
Lepanto
_
,
opened
fire
upon
the
_
Petropavlovsk
_
,
and
was
quickly
followed
by
others
,
until
the
action
became
general
all
round
.
 
<EOS>
Aid
had
arrived
just
in
time
,
and
the
British
vessels
,
with
engines
broken
,
stood
away
at
some
distance
,
leaving
matters
for
the
nonce
to
the
powerful
Italian
Squadron
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
a
very
formidable
one
,
and
its
appearance
caused
the
Russian
Admiral
such
misgivings
that
he
gave
orders
to
retreat
,
a
manoeuvre
attempted
unsuccessfully
.
<EOS>
The
Italian
Fleet
,
as
it
loomed
up
in
the
falling
gloom
,
included
no
fewer
than
twenty
-
six
warships
and
forty
-
three
torpedo
boats
.
<EOS>
The
vessels
consisted
of
the
barbette
-
ship
_
<EOS>
Lepanto
_
of
15,000
tons
;
the
_
Sardegna

Ruggiero

of
11,000

;
the

_
Dandolo
_
and
_

_
of
the

size
;
the

;
the
armoured

_
Ancona

,

,
and
_

_
,
and
the
_
San

,
each

about
4500

;
the

_
Andrea

<EOS>
the

_
,
and
thirty
-
eight
others
.
 
<EOS>
With
such
a
force
descending
upon
the
Russian
ships
,
which
had
already
been
very
severely
punished
by
the
vigorous
fire
of
the
British
,
there
was
little
wonder
that
the
Tsar
's
vessels
should
endeavour
to
escape
.
<EOS>
The
Italian
Fleet
had
already
bombarded
and
destroyed
Ajaccio
two
days
ago
,
and
,
steaming
south
from
the
Corsican
capital
,
had
anchored
for
twenty
-
four
hours
off
Cape
della
Caccia
,
near
Alghero
,
in
the
north
of
Sardinia
.
<EOS>
Then
again
taking
a
southerly
course
in
the
expectation
of
joining
hands
with
the
British
Mediterranean
Squadron
,
which
was
on
its
way
from
Marseilles
to
Cagliari
,
they
had
fallen
in
with
the
three
crippled
ships
.
 
<EOS>
Without
hesitation
the
powerful
Italian
ironclads
,
several
of
which
were
among
the
finest
in
the
world
,
opened
a
terrific
fire
upon
the
Russian

and
as
darkness
fell
the
sight
was
one
of
appalling
grandeur

From
all
sides
flame
rushed
from
turrets
and
barbettes
in
vivid
flashes
,
while
the
Maxims
in
the

poured
out
their
deadly
showers
of
bullets

The

of
the

Ruggiero

crashed
and
roared
time
after
time
,
their
great
shots
causing
frightful
havoc
among
the
Russian
ships
,
the
four
100-tonners
of
the

_
and
the
67-tonners
of
the

,

_
,
and
_

_
simply
knocking
to
pieces
the
_

.
<EOS>
The
Russian
ships
were
receiving
terrible
blows
on
every
hand
.
<EOS>
With
their
search
-
lights
beaming
forth
in
all
directions
,
the
ships
were
fighting
fiercely
,
pounding
away
at
each
other
with
deafening
din
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
,
however
,
before
this
vigorous
attack
of
the
Italians
began
to
tell
,
for
within
an
hour
of
the
first
shot
from
the
_
<EOS>
Lepanto
_
<EOS>
the
fine
Russian
battleship
_
Gheorghy
Pobyednosets
_
and
the
great
new
cruiser
_
Minsk
_
of
17,000
tons
had
been
rammed
and
sunk
,
the
former
by
the
_
Duilio
_
,
and
the
latter
by
the
_
Re
Umberto
_
,
while
the
_
Tchesme
_
and
the
gunboat
_
Otvazny
_
had
been
torpedoed
,
and
scarcely
a
soul
saved
out
of
1500
men
who
were
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
Explosions
were
occurring
in
quick
succession
,
and
red
glares
flashed
momentarily
over
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Hither
and
thither
as
the
Italian
torpedo
boats
darted
they
ejected
their
missiles
,
and
the
rapid
and
terrible
fire
from
the
leviathans
of
Italy
,
pouring
into
every
one
of
the
remaining
ships
of
the
Tsar
,
killed
hundreds
who
were
striving
to
defend
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
_
Sicilia
_
,
which
had
been
fighting
the
Russian
flagship
,
the
_
Tria
Sviatitelia
_
,
at
close
quarters
,
and
had
blown
away
her
conning
-
tower
and
greater
portion
of
her
superstructure
,
performed
a
neat
evolution
,
and
crashed
her
ram
right
into
her
opponent
's
broadside
,
breaking
her
almost
in
half
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
there
was
a
terrific
explosion
on
board
,
and
then
the
doomed
vessel
sank
into
the
dark
rolling
sea
,
carrying
with
her
the
Russian
Admiral
and
all
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Quickly
this
success
was
followed
by
others
--
the
blowing
up
of
the
monster
new
cruiser
_
Tiumen
_
,
the
sinking
of
the
_
Adler
_
and
four
other
Russian
torpedo
boats
,
occurring
in
rapid
succession
.
<EOS>
Seeing
with
what
rapidity
and
irresistible
force
they
were
being
swept
from
the
sea
,
the
remainder
of
the
Tsar
's
shattered
fleet
struck
their
flags
and
called
for
quarter
,
not
,
however
,
before
the
torpedo
boat
_
Kodor
_
had
been
sunk
.
<EOS>
The
Russians
thus
captured
were
the

_
of
10,960

,
the

CHAPTER

.
 
<EOS>
PANIC
IN
LANCASHIRE
.
  
<EOS>
The
Russians
were
within
gunshot
of
Manchester
!
<EOS>
A
profound
sensation
was
caused
in
that
city
about
eight
o'clock
on
the
evening
of
September
6th
,
by
an
announcement
made
by
the
_
Evening
News_--which
still
appeared
in
fitful
editions
--
that
a
Cossack
patrol
had
been
seen
on
the
road
between
Macclesfield
and
Alderley
,
and
that
it
was
evident
,
from
the
manner
of
the
Russian
advance
,
that
they
meant
to
attack
the
city
almost
immediately
.
 
<EOS>
The
utmost
alarm
was
caused
,
and
the
streets
were
everywhere
crowded
by
anxious
,
starving
throngs
,
eager
to
ascertain
fuller
details
,
but
unable
to
gather
anything
further
beyond
the
wild
conjectures
of
idle
gossip
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
city
which
,
on
the
outbreak
of
war
,
was
one
of
the
most
prosperous
in
the
world
,
was
now
but
a
sorry
semblance
of
its
former
self
.
<EOS>
Heated
,
excited
,
turbulent
,
its
streets
echoed
with
the
heartrending
wails
of
despairing
crowds
,
its
factories
were
idle
,
its
shops
closed
,
and
its
people
were
succumbing
to
the
horrible
,
lingering
death
which
is
the
result
of
starvation
.
 
<EOS>
Wealth
availed
them
naught
.
<EOS>
Long
ago
the
last
loaf
had
been
devoured
,
the
last
sack
of
flour
had
been
divided
,
and
the
rich
living
in
the
suburbs
now
felt
the
pinch
of
hunger
quite
as
acutely
as
factory
operatives
,
who
lounged
,
hands
in
pockets
,
about
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Manchester
,
like
most
other
towns
in
England
,
had
come
to
the
end
of
her
supplies
,
and
death
and
disease
now
decimated
the
more
populous
districts
,
while
those
who
had
left
the
city
and
tramped
north
had
fared
no
better
,
and
hundreds
dropped
and
died
by
the
roadside
.
 
<EOS>
The
situation
in
Lancashire
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
At
Liverpool
a
few
vessels
were
arriving
from
America
,
under
escort
of
British
cruisers
,
bringing
supplies
,
but
these
were
mostly
purchased
at
enormously
high
rates
,
and
sent
to
London
by
way
of
Manchester
and
Sheffield
,
railway
communication
by
that
route
being
still
open
.
<EOS>
This
fact
becoming
known
in
Manchester
caused
the
greatest
indignation
,
and
the
people
,
rendered
desperate
by
hunger
,
succeeded
on
several
occasions
in
stopping
the
trains
,
and
appropriating
the
food
they
carried
.
<EOS>
The
situation
in
Manchester
was
one
of
constant
excitement
,
and
fear
that
the
enemy
should
repeat
the
success
they
had
achieved
at
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
The
hundreds
of
thousands
of
hungry
ones
who
flocked
Manchester
streets
and
the
grimy
thoroughfares
of
Stockport
,
Ashton
,
Oldham
,
Bolton
,
and
other
great
towns
in
the
vicinity
,
feared
that
they
,
like
the
people
of
Birmingham
,
would
be
put
to
the
sword
by
the
ruthless
invaders
.
 
<EOS>
The
week
that
had
elapsed
had
been
an
eventful
one
,
fraught
with
many
horrors
.
<EOS>
After
the
success
of
the
Russians
at
Birmingham
,
the
British
troops
,
both
Regulars
,
Volunteers
,
and
improvised
,
fell
back
and
formed
up
north
of
the
city
,
being
practically
nothing
more
than
a
strong
line
of
outposts
without
reserves
,
extending
from
Dudley
,
through
West
Bromwich
and
Sutton
Park
,
to
Tamworth
.
<EOS>
This
scheme
,
however
,
was
ill
-
devised
,
for
the
defenders
,
in
order
to
act
successfully
,
should
have
fallen
back
much
further
,
and
concentrated
their
forces
at
one
or
two
strategical
points
on
the
line
to
Manchester
,
as
it
had
been
ascertained
from
spies
that
a
swift
and
vigorous
attack
on
that
city
was
meditated
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
following
the
taking
of
Birmingham
was
devoted
by
the
enemy
to
the
reorganisation
of
their
forces
,
and
the
rearrangement
of
their
transport
and
ammunition
train
.
<EOS>
Large
quantities
of
waggons
and
war
stores
of
all
kinds
had
been
found
in
the
town
and
annexed
by
the
victors
,
and
at
Kynoch
's
Factory
at
Aston
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
rounds
of
ammunition
had
been
seized
.
<EOS>
These
had
been
made
for
a
foreign
government
,
and
fitted
both
rifles
and
machine
guns
of
the
Russians
.
 
<EOS>
Having
thus
reorganised
,
the
Russians
,
leaving
10,000
men
in
Birmingham
as
a
base
,
resumed
their
march
north
on
the
third
day
.
<EOS>
The
left
flank
,
consisting
of
2000
cavalry
and
12,000
infantry
,
took
the
road
through
West
Bromwich
to
Wednesbury
and
Bilston
,
but
quickly
found
themselves
entrapped
,
for
on
account
of
the
many
canals
their
cavalry
were
unable
to
act
,
and
their
transport
was
cut
off
.
<EOS>
The
miners
and
factory
men
had
armed
themselves
,
and
,
acting
in
conjunction
with
the
British
troops
from
Dudley
and
Great
Barr
,
succeeded
,
after
some
hard
fighting
around
Tipton
and
Coseley
,
in
completely
annihilating
the
enemy
,
taking
5000
prisoners
and
killing
the
remaining
9000
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
right
flank
had
passed
out
of
Birmingham
by
way
of
Castle
Bromwich
,
and
had
advanced
without
opposition
through
Wishaw
and
Tamworth
to
Lichfield
,
driving
the
defenders
before
them
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
main
column
,
however
,
were
not
allowed
to
go
north
without
a
most
desperate
endeavour
on
the
part
of
our
men
to
hold
them
in
check
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
ever
British
courage
showed
itself
it
was
during
those
dark
days
.
<EOS>
Advancing
through
Aston
and
Perry
to
Sutton
along
the
ancient
highway
,
Icknield
Street
,
the
Russians
sent
a
large
force
through
the
woods
to
the
high
ground
between
Wild
Green
and
Maney
.
<EOS>
Here
the
British
had
established
strong
batteries
,
but
after
some
desperate
fighting
these
were
at
length
captured
,
the
enemy
losing
heavily
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
fierce
fighting
occurred
in
Sutton
Park
and
across
at
Aldridge
,
the
defenders
making
the
most
strenuous
efforts
to
break
the
force
of
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
All
was
,
alas
!
<EOS>
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
British
,
outnumbered
as
before
,
were
compelled
to
fall
back
fighting
,
with
the
result
that
the
enemy
's
main
column
,
pushing
on
,
effected
a
junction
with
its
right
flank
,
which
had
bivouaced
on
Wittington
Heath
,
near
Lichfield
,
and
occupied
the
barracks
there
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
following
the
invaders
broke
into
two
columns
and
marched
again
north
,
practically
in
battle
formation
,
the
right
column
continuing
along
Icknield
Street
,
through
Burton
,
Derby
,
Bakewell
,
and
Marple
,
driving
back
the
defenders
,
while
the
left
column
took
a
route
that
lay
through
the
hilly
and
wooded
country
near
Cannock
Chase
.
<EOS>
Both
columns
,
advancing
in
echelon
of
division
,
with
cavalry
on
their
flanks
,
were
constantly
harassed
in
the
rear
by
the
British
,
and
in
their
advance
lost
numbers
of
waggons
and
a
large
quantity
of
ammunition
;
but
they
succeeded
in
travelling
so
quickly
north
that
they
were
actually
marching
on
Manchester
before
the
people
in
that
city
could
realise
it
.
<EOS>
Signal
acts
of
bravery
were
being
everywhere
reported
,
but
what
could
individual
heroism
effect
against
the
fearful
odds
we
had
to
face
?
 
<EOS>
Thousands
of
men
in
Bolton
,
Bury
,
Oldham
,
Wigan
,
Rochdale
,
and
other
neighbouring
towns
had
already
armed
themselves
,
and
,
on
hearing
that
Manchester
was
threatened
,
poured
into
the
city
to
act
their
part
bravely
in
its
defence
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
admitted
that
the
British
General
commanding
had
,
on
gaining
knowledge
of
the
intentions
of
the
Russians
,
taken
every
precaution
in
his
power
to
prevent
an
advance
on
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
Our
troops
which
had
been
defeated
and
driven
back
from
Birmingham
,
had
at
once
retreated
north
to
the
Peak
district
,
and
about
one
-
quarter
of
the
number
had
taken
up
excellent
defensive
positions
there
,
while
the
remainder
,
with
small
reinforcements
of
Regulars
drawn
from
Lancaster
,
Warrington
,
Bury
,
Chester
,
Wrexham
,
Burnley
,
Ashton
-
under
-
Lyne
,
York
,
Halifax
,
and
as
far
distant
as
Carlisle
,
had
,
in
addition
to
those
from
Manchester
,
been
massed
along
the
north
bank
of
the
Mersey
from
Stockport
to
Flixton
,
with
a
line
of
communication
stretching
across
to
Woodley
Junction
,
and
thence
over
Glossop
Dale
to
the
Peak
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
Manchester
was
defended
by
a
force
of
38,000
cavalry
,
infantry
,
Volunteers
,
and
colonials
,
against
the
Russian
army
,
consisting
of
the
remaining
65,000
of
the
force
which
attacked
Birmingham
,
and
reinforcements
of
10,000
infantry
and
5000
cavalry
that
had
been
pushed
rapidly
forward
from
Sussex
over
the
ground
that
the
main
body
had
travelled
.
<EOS>
The
total
force
of
Russians
was
therefore
80,000
.
 
<EOS>
From
Stockport
,
the
north
bank
of
the
Mersey
to
its
confluence
with
the
Irwell
past
Flixton
was
well
guarded
.
<EOS>
Earthworks
had
been
raised
,
trenches
dug
,
walls
had
been
loopholed
,
and
houses
placed
in
a
state
of
hasty
defence

<EOS>
Among
the
reinforcements
now
under

were
several

<EOS>
That
a
desperate
and
bloody
fray
was
imminent
,
every
one
knew
,
and
the
people
were
trusting
to
the
defensive
line
on
the
river
bank
to
protect
them
from
the
foreign
destroyer
.
<EOS>
Would
they
be
strong
enough
to
effectively
resist
?
<EOS>
Would
they
be
able
to
drive
back
the
Russians
and
defeat
them
?
 
<EOS>
The
people
of
Lancashire
who
condemned
our
military
administration
did
not
do
so
without
cause
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
claimed
by
many
that
England
could
never
be
invaded
;
nevertheless
our
course
should
have
been
to
prepare
for
possible
events
.
<EOS>
Our
Army
,
being
small
,
should
have
been
better
equipped
and
armed
,
as
well
as
trained
to
balance
weakness
in
numbers
.
<EOS>
Again
,
there
had
always
existed
a
hideous
hindrance
to
the
efficiency
of
the
Auxiliaries
--
the
arms
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
Martini
-
Henrys
carried
by
the
Volunteers
bore
date
of
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
,
and
their
barrels
were
so
worn
they
could
not
be
fired
accurately
;
while
others
possessed
the
Snider
,
which
was
practically
a
smoothbore
from
wear
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
use
of
weapons
surpassed
in
power
by
those
of
other
nations
?
<EOS>
It
was
an
unpalatable
truth
that
had
now
at
last
dawned
upon
Britain
,
that
in
arming
her
soldiers
she
was
far
behind
the
rest
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
While
Manchester
spent
the
sultry
night
in
feverish
excitement
at
the
knowledge
that
the
enemy
had
advanced
almost
to
their
doors
,
the
British
outposts
were
being
harassed
by
the
enemy
,
who
,
flushed
with
success
,
were
advancing
gradually
onward
towards
the
line
of
defence
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
front
had
been
suddenly
widely
extended
,
evidently
aiming
at
a
concentric
attack
on
Manchester
,
and
an
attempt
to
wholly
envelop
the
defenders
'
position
by
cavalry
operating
on
both
flanks
.
 
<EOS>
Some
terribly
desperate
encounters
took
place
during
a
frightful
thunderstorm
which
lasted
a
portion
of
the
night
,
and
many
a
brave
Briton
fell
while
performing
valiant
deeds
for
the
honour
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
The
anxiety
within
the
British
lines
that
hot
night
was
intense
.
 
<EOS>
Reports
coming
in
told
of
fierce
fighting
all
along
the
line
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
midnight
a
British
patrol
,
supported
by
cavalry
,
that
had
been
sent
out
from
Northenden
to
Baguley
,
was
suddenly
attacked
by
a
party
of
Russians
,
who
lay
in
ambush
close
to
Wythenshaw
Hall
.
<EOS>
A
short
but
fierce
fight
ensued
,
but
the
British
,
knowing
that
part
of
the
country
well
,
succeeded
in
totally
annihilating
their
antagonists
.
<EOS>
The
firing
,
however
,
attracted
attention
in
the
Russian
lines
,
with
the
result
that
a
second
attack
was
quickly
made
upon
them
,
compelling
them
to
retire
up
the
hill
at
Lawton
Moor
,
where
they
dashed
into
a
small
wood
,
closely
pressed
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
The
attack
was
desperate
.
<EOS>
There
is
something
terrible
in
a
fight
in
a
wood
at
night
.
<EOS>
The
combatants
could
see
nothing
save
an
occasional
flash
in
the
impenetrable
darkness
,
and
hoarse
cries
went
up
from
the
mysterious
inferno
.
<EOS>
Neither
invader
nor
defender
could
distinguish
each
other
,
and
in
the
half
-
hour
that
followed
,
many
a
Russian
shot
his
comrade
in
mistake
for
his
foe
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
defenders
,
finding
that
the
slightest
rustling
of
boughs
brought
down
a
volley
from
magazine
rifles
,
stood
motionless
,
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
,
and
waited
anxiously
,
until
at
last
the
enemy
,
seeing
that
their
efforts
to
drive
them
out
were
useless
,
withdrew
,
and
went
off
towards
Baguley
.
 
<EOS>
In
another
direction
,
close
to
Henbury
,
near
Macclesfield
,
a
squadron
of
British
cavalry
surprised
a
small
outpost
camp
of
Russians
,
and
cut
it
up
terribly
,
killing
half
the
number
;
but
pushing
on
to
Marthall
,
six
miles
across
country
,
they
came
into
collision
with
a
body
of
Russian
dragoons
,
and
after
a
very
fierce
encounter
were
compelled
to
fall
back
again
after
considerable
loss
.
<EOS>
On
the
outskirts
of
Northwich
,
and
on
the
borders
of
Delamere
Forest
,
skirmishes
occurred
,
resulting
in
serious
loss
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
A
reconnoitring
party
of
Russians
was
totally
swept
away
and
every
man
killed
,
by
a
British
party
who
were
concealed
in
an
old
farm
building
close
to
Alderley
village
;
while
another
engaged
in
surveying
the
roads
to
Altrincham
had
been
forced
to
retreat
,
leaving
half
their
number
dead
or
wounded
on
the
edge
of
Tatton
Park

CHAPTER

<EOS>
THE
EVE
OF
BATTLE
.
  
<EOS>
Some
idea
of
the
gallant
conduct
of
our
Volunteers
during
the
night
may
be
gathered
from
the
following
extract
from
a
letter
by
Lieutenant
John
Rowling
of
the
2nd
Volunteer
Battalion
of
the
East
Lancashire
Regiment
,
to
a
friend
a
few
days
afterwards
.
<EOS>
He
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
You
will
no
doubt
have
heard
something
about
the
warm
work
we
had
on
the
night
before
the
Battle
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
The
city
,
as
you
know
,
was
covered
on
the
south
by
a
long
straggling
line
of
outposts
,
extending
practically
from
Stockport
to
Altrincham
.
<EOS>
Late
in
the
afternoon
of
September
6th
we
received
an
order
to
proceed
to
Mere
,
about
four
miles
from
Altrincham
,
having
been
detailed
to
form
the
section
of
the
outposts
from
New
Tatton
to
Goodier
's
Green
,
and
on
arrival
at
Mere
half
of
our
force
of
600
was
left
in
reserve
there
;
the
supports
were
moved
about
half
a
mile
down
Watling
Street
,
and
the
remainder
was
divided
into
three
piquets
,
No
.
1
at
Bentley
Hurst
Farm
,
No
.
2
at
Moss
Cottage
,
and
No
.
3
near
Mereplatt
Farm
,
with
four
double
sentry
posts
out
in
front
of
each
piquet
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
command
of
No
.
2
picket
,
with
Anderson
and
Wishton
as
subs
,
and
as
soon
as
I
returned
to
the
piquet
,
after
posting
the
sentries
,
I
sent
the
former
with
two
sections
to
form
a
detached
post
at
Over
Tabley
,
and
instructed
him
to
send
a
reconnoitring
patrol
as
far
down
Watling
Street
as
he
might
consider
consistent
with
safety
.
<EOS>
Anderson
posted
his
men
,
and
returned
to
me
about
ten
o'clock
with
a
corporal
and
two
men
,
bringing
in
a
man
who
had
been
pointed
out
to
him
at
Over
Tabley
as
a
suspicious
character
--
<EOS>
in
fact
,
he
was
said
to
be
a
spy
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
staying
at
an
inn
there
for
two
or
three
days
,
and
had
very
little
luggage
.
<EOS>
Anderson
had
examined
his
portmanteau
,
but
found
nothing
there
;
and
as
the
man
refused
to
give
any
account
of
himself
,
he
made
him
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Fresh
fires
were
continually
breaking
out
,
therefore
I
thought
it
best
to
waste
no
time
questioning
him
,
but
took
him
into
a
room
at
Moss
Cottage
,
where
he
was
thoroughly
searched
.
<EOS>
Notes
were
found
upon
him
from
which
it
was
evident
that
he
had
been
obtaining
information
for
the
enemy
for
some
time
,
and
,
better
still
,
particulars
of
their
proposed
operations
for
the
investment
of
Manchester
,
showing
that
they
were
advancing
in
our
direction
along
the
old
Watling
Street
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
sent
the
prisoner
under
escort
to
the
commander
of
the
outposts
,
and
at
the
same
time
sent
word
to
Nos
.
1
and
3
piquets
,
after
which
Anderson
and
I
went
down
to
Over
Tabley
,
leaving
Wishton
in
charge
of
No
.
2
.
<EOS>
The
machine
gun
that
had
been
allotted
to
my
piquet
<EOS>
I
also
ordered
to
Over
Tabley
,
and
on
arrival
there
we
threw
up
barricades
,
hastily
constructed
of
barrels
,
doors
,
and
logs
,
banked
with
earth
,
across
the
road
between
the
Vicarage
and
the
church
.
<EOS>
A
quantity
of
barbed
wire
was
found
in
the
village
,
and
this
came
in
very
useful
,
for
we
stretched
several
lengths
of
it
across
the
roads
on
the
off
-
side
of
the
barricade
.
 
<EOS>
"
There
were
under
thirty
of
us
,
but
every
man
was
determined
to
do
his
duty
unflinchingly
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
it
was
past
eleven
,
and
very
dark
,
yet
there
was
just
light
enough
to
train
the
gun
on
to
the
centre
of
the
cross
-
roads
by
Dairyhouse
Farm
.
<EOS>
Very
soon
we
could
hear
the
enemy
approaching
,
and
as
their
spy
had
not
met
them
outside
,
they
evidently
concluded
that
the
village
was
unoccupied
,
and
advanced
in
comparatively
close
order
,
Cossacks
leading
,
and
the
infantry
so
close
that
there
was
practically
no
division
between
their
vanguard
and
mainguard
.
<EOS>
The
first
section
of
Cossacks
very
soon
found
our
first
wire
,
and
the
whole
of
their
horses
came
to
grief
.
<EOS>
Those
in
the
rear
,
thinking
probably
that
there
was
no
other
obstruction
in
the
way
,
spurred
their
horses
and
galloped
over
their
friends
,
only
to
meet
with
a
similar
fate
further
on
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
pioneers
doubled
up
,
and
began
to
cut
the
wires
,
and
fearing
that
the
infantry
in
the
rear
would
soon
deploy
,
I
gave
the
order
for
independent
firing
.
<EOS>
The
Russians
stood
it
for
some
minutes
,
and
attempted
to
reply
,
but
not
a
man
of
ours
was
visible
,
and
they
soon
retreated
to
Tabley
Hall
,
where
I
had
no
means
of
following
them
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
remembered
that
we
were
all
Volunteers
,
the
Regulars
being
on
the
Stockport
flank
of
the
outpost
line
.
<EOS>
My
men
behaved
splendidly
,
and
the
firing
was
excellent
from
first
to
last
.
"
 
<EOS>
About
the
same
time
as
the
unsuccessful
attack
was
made
on
the
outposts
at
Mere
<EOS>
,
the
British
line
was
broken
through
at
Heald
Green
and
Appletree
.
 
<EOS>
A
cavalry
patrol
,
supported
by
infantry
,
was
feeling
its
way
along
the
road
to
Wilmslow
,
and
had
passed
Willow
Farm
,
at
which
point
the
road
runs
beside
the
railway
embankment
.
 
<EOS>
The
storm
had
burst
,
the
thunder
rolled
incessantly
,
rain
fell
in
torrents
,
and
the
lightning
played
about
them
,
causing
their
arms
to
gleam
in
its
vivid
flashes
.
 
<EOS>
Slowly
,
and
without
undue
noise
,
the
patrol
was
wending
its
way
up
the
hill
towards
Finney
Green
,
when
suddenly
there
was
a
terrific
rattle
of
musketry
,
and
they
discovered
to
their
surprise
that
the
enemy
,
who
were
occupying
the
embankment
of
the
North
-
Western
Railway
on
their
left
,
were
pouring
upon
them
a
fire
sufficient
to
blanch
the
cheek
of
the
bravest
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Along
the
embankment
for
a
mile
or
more
were
stationed
infantry
with
magazine
rifles
,
and
in
addition
they
had
brought
two
machine
guns
into
play
with
appalling
effect
.
<EOS>
So
sudden
did
this
galling
fire
open
upon
them
,
that
men
and
horses
fell
without
being
able
to
fire
a
shot
in
return
.
<EOS>
British
infantry
,
however
,
stood
their
ground
,
and
as
the
lightning
flashed
,
disclosing
the
position
of
the
enemy
,
every
Russian
who
dared
to
stand
up
or
show
himself
was
promptly
picked
off
.
<EOS>
But
against
the
awful
rain
of
deadly
bullets
ejected
from
the
machine
guns
,
at
the
rate
of
600
a
minute
,
no
force
could
make
a
successful
defence
.
 
<EOS>
Many
British
heroes
fell
pierced
by
a
dozen
bullets
;
still
their
comrades
,
seeking
what
shelter
<EOS>
they
could
,
continued
the
defensive
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
over
the
dismal
muddy
road
the
survivors
of
the
cavalry
galloped
back
,
and
quickly
reported
to
the
commander
of
the
piquet
at
Appletree
that
the
enemy
were
in
strong
force
on
the
other
side
of
the
embankment
between
Oaklands
and
Wilmslow
Park
,
and
as
they
had
heard
a
train
run
into
Wilmslow
Station
and
stop
,
it
was
evident
that
the
enemy
had
reopened
the
line
from
Crewe
,
and
intended
concentrating
part
of
their
reinforcements
to
the
general
advance
.
<EOS>
The
facts
that
the
enemy
had
succeeded
in
cutting
all
the
telegraph
lines
in
the
district
,
and
had
now
obtained
complete
control
over
the
railway
,
were
most
alarming
,
and
the
outlook
of
the
defenders
was
rendered
doubly
serious
by
the
large
force
they
were
compelled
to
keep
east
of
Stockport
,
and
in
the
Peak
district
,
to
prevent
the
invaders
getting
round
to
attack
Manchester
from
the
north
.
 
<EOS>
On
receipt
of
the
news
of
the
disaster
to
the
patrol
,
the
commander
of
the
piquet
at
Appletree
immediately
sent
information
to
the
commander
of
the
piquet
posted
at
the
railway
station
at
Cheadle
Hulme
;
but
by
a
strange
oversight
,
due
no
doubt
to
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
sent
no
report
to
the
commander
of
the
outposts
.
<EOS>
The
infantry
engaging
the
Russians
on
the
embankment
,
though
exhibiting
most
gallant
courage
,
were
so
exposed
that
it
was
little
wonder
they
were
soon
completely
annihilated
,
only
half
a
dozen
escaping
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
must
have
detrained
a
large
number
of
troops
at
Wilmslow
,
for
the
British
cavalry
scouts
were
quickly
followed
up
by
Cossacks
and
the
Tsar
's
Dragoons
.
<EOS>
Quickly
the
sentries
between
Heald
Green
and
Appletree
were
driven
back
on
their
piquets
,
the
latter
extending
in
skirmishing
order
.
<EOS>
Such
a
manoeuvre
,
however
,
proved
fatal
in
the
darkness
and
on
the
heavy
ploughed
land
over
which
they
were
fighting
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
very
few
succeeded
in
reaching
the
supports
,
and
when
they
did
,
they
all
fell
back
hurriedly
on
the
reserves
at
Pimgate
.
 
<EOS>
[

THE
BATTLEFIELD
OF
MANCHESTER
.
]
 
<EOS>
Then
the
commander
of
the
piquet
at
Cheadle
Hulme
Station
,
finding
that
he
must
inevitably
be
attacked
by
road
and
rail
,
set
the
station
on
fire
,
and
with
the
assistance
of
the
railway
officials
blew
up
a
large
portion
of
the
permanent
way
with
dynamite
,
thus
cutting
off
the
enemy
's
means
of
communication
.
<EOS>
This
accomplished
,
he
fell
back
upon
his
supports
at
Adswood
,
and
they
,
at
about
2
A.M.
,
retreated
with
the
reserves
to
the
embankment
of
the
North
-
Western
Railway
which
carries
the
line
from
Stockport
to
Whaley
Bridge
,
and
took
up
a
strong
position
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
Stockport
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
town
was
defended
on
three
sides
by
railway
embankments
,
which
were
now
occupied
by
strong
bodies
of
Regulars
,
with
several
Maxims
.
<EOS>
One
embankment
ran
from
the
west
boundary
of
the
town
to
Middlewood
Junction
,
another
from
Middlewood
to
Marple
,
and
a
third
from
Marple
to
Mayercroft
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
night
the
defenders
were
in
hourly
expectation
that
an
attack
would
be
made
upon
their
positions
,
with
the
object
of
investing
Stockport
as
a
preliminary
to
the
assault
on
the
defensive
lines
north
of
the
Mersey
;
but
the
enemy
apparently
had
other
objects
,
and
the
disaster
to
the
British
cavalry
patrol
on
the
Wilmslow
road
was
,
unfortunately
,
followed
by
a
second
and
more
serious
one
.
<EOS>
The
Cossacks
and
Dragoons
that
followed
the
British
cavalry
scouts
overtook
them
just
as
they
had
joined
their
reserves
,
a
short
distance
beyond
Pimgate
,
about
half
-
past
two
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
fight
ensued
,
and
the
force
of
British
cavalry
and
infantry
was
gradually
drawn
into
a
cunningly
-
devised
trap
,
and
then
there
suddenly
appeared
a
great
force
of
Russians
,
who
simply
swept
down
upon
them
,
slaughtering
the
whole
of
them
with
brutal
ferocity
,
not
,
however
,
before
they
had
fought
desperately
,
and
inflicted
enormous
loss
upon
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Having
totally
annihilated
that
detachment
of
defenders
,
the
Russians
marched
into
Cheadle
,
and
,
after
sacking
the
little
town
,
burned
it
,
together
with
the
Grange
,
the
Print
Works
,
the
railway
station
,
<EOS>
St.
Mary
's
Church
,
and
a
number
of
large
mills
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
army
of
the
Tsar
had
bivouaced
,
reserving
its
strength
for
a
desperate
dash
upon
Manchester
.
<EOS>
But
the
British
outposts
stood
wakeful
and
vigilant
,
ready
at
any
moment
to
sound
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
To
those
entrenched
beyond
the
winding
Mersey
,
soaked
by
the
heavy
rain
,
and
spending
the
dark
hours
in
anxiety
,
there
came
over
the
dismal
country
the
sound
of
distant
rifle
-
firing
mingling
with
the
roll
of
the
thunder
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
they
knew
that
every
man
would
be
fighting
for
his
life
against
the
great
hordes
of
invaders
who
would
descend
upon
them
swiftly
and
mercilessly
.
<EOS>
Across
the
country
from
the
Peak
away
to
Chester
,
the
Briton
bravely
faced
his
foe
,
anxious
and
vigilant
,
awaiting
breathlessly
the
progress
of
events
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
passed
the
stormy
,
oppressive
night
,
till
the
grey
dawn
of
a
fateful
day
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
 
<EOS>
MANCHESTER
ATTACKED
BY
RUSSIANS
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
first
streak
of
daylight
the
anxious
,
excited
crowds
of
men
and
women
,
surging
up
and
down
the
principal
streets
of
Manchester
,
were
alarmed
by
the
sounds
of
heavy
firing
.
<EOS>
A
terrible
panic
instantly
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
battle
had
actually
commenced
!
 
<EOS>
Half
-
starved
operatives
,
with
pale
,
wan
faces
,
stood
in
groups
in
Deansgate
,
Market
Street
,
Piccadilly
,
and
London
Road
,
while
men
,
armed
with
any
weapons
they
could
obtain
,
rushed
out
along
the
main
roads
to
the
south
of
the
city
to
assist
in
its
defence
.
<EOS>
Lancashire
men
exhibited
commendable
patriotism
,
even
though
they
had
not
hesitated
to
criticise
the
administration
of
our
War
Department
;
for
now
at
the
critical
hour
not
a
man
flinched
from
his
duty
,
both
old
and
young
taking
up
arms
for
their
country
's
honour
.
 
<EOS>
During
the
eventful
night
at
all
approaches
to
the
city
from
the
south
<EOS>
the
roads
had
been
thrown
into
a
state
of
hasty
defence
.
<EOS>
A
formidable
barricade
had
been
constructed
at
a
point
in
the
Stretford
Road
close
to
the
Botanical
Gardens
to
prevent
the
enemy
from
advancing
up
the
Chester
or
Stretford
New
Roads
;
another
was
thrown
up
at
the
junction
of
Chorlton
Road
,
Withington
Road
,
Upper
Chorlton
Road
,
and
Moss
Lane
West
;
a
third
opposite
Rusholme
Hall
prevented
any
march
up
the
Wilmslow
Road
;
while
others
of
minor
strength
blocked
the
Anson
Road
close
to
the
Elms
,
the
London
Road
at
Longsight
,
the
Hyde
Road
opposite
Belle
Vue
Prison
,
and
at
Ivy
Place
in
the
Ashton
Old
Road
.
 
<EOS>
These
had
all
been
raised
out
of
any
materials
that
came
to
hand
.
<EOS>
Barrels
,
brick
rubbish
,
planks
,
doors
,
flooring
of
houses
hastily
torn
up
,
and
scaffold
poles
lashed
together
;
in
fact
,
the
barriers
were
huge
piles
of
miscellaneous
and
portable
articles
,
even
furniture
from
neighbouring
houses
being
utilised
,
while
lengths
of
iron
railings
and
wire
torn
from
fences
played
an
important
part
in
these
hastily
-
built
defences
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
,
armed
with
rifles
,
shot
-
guns
,
pistols
,
knives
,
and
any
other
weapon
that
came
handiest
,
the
men
of
Manchester
waited
,
breathlessly
impatient
in
the
expectation
of
attack
.
 
<EOS>
As
dawn
spread
bright
and
rosy
,
and
the
mist
cleared
from
the
low
meadows
beside
the
Mersey
,
the
distant
firing
was
continuous
,
and
the
one
or
two
shells
that
fell
and
burst
in
the
centre
of
the
city
were
precursory
of
an
awful
sanguinary
struggle
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
a
person
in
that
densely
populated
area
had
slept
that
night
,
and
the
streets
were
everywhere
full
,
the
most
exciting
and
heartrending
scenes
being
witnessed
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
crowd
that
assembled
in
Albert
Square
was
addressed
by
the
Mayor
from
the
steps
of
the
Town
Hall
,
and
urged
to
strain
every
muscle
to
drive
back
the
invaders
,
in
order
that
the
disaster
at
Birmingham
should
not
be
repeated
.
<EOS>
Even
as
he
spoke
,
in
the
interval
of
wild
cheering
and
the
energetic
singing
of
the
National
Anthem
and
"
Rule
,
Britannia
,
"
the
distant
crackling
of
rifles
and
the
low
booming
of
field
guns
could
be
heard
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
din
of
battle
--
<EOS>
the
catastrophe
caused
by
the
cunning
spy
Von
Beilstein
,
who
was
still
living
in
luxury
in
London
,
and
who
still
posed
as
the
friend
of
Geoffrey
Engleheart
and
Violet
Vayne
!
 
<EOS>
Geoffrey
was
still
with
the
Volunteers
assisting
in
the
defence
of
London
,
but
the
French
spy
who
had
sent
the
forged
orders
to
our
Navy
had
apparently
made
good
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
in
Manchester
,
the
sound
of
the
guns
aroused
that
patriotic
enthusiasm
latent
in
the
heart
of
every
Briton
.
<EOS>
True
,
they
were
weary
,
famished
,
ill
from
lack
of
food
,
yet
they
were
fiercely
determined
that
the
invader
should
never
tread
their
streets
,
nor
should
incendiaries
burn
or
Russian
artillery
destroy
their
handsome
buildings
--
monuments
of
England
's
wealth
and
greatness
.
<EOS>
In
St.
Peter
's
Square
,
at
a
mass
meeting
attended
by
nearly
twelve
thousand
people
,
a
demonstration
was
made
against
the
enemy
,
and
it
was
resolved
that
every
man
should
act
his
part
in
the
struggle
,
and
that
no
quarter
should
be
shown
the
legions
of
the
Tsar
;
while
at
another
impromptu
meeting
held
in
Piccadilly
,
in
the
open
space
opposite
the
Infirmary
,
the
conduct
of
the
Russians
before
Birmingham
was
denounced
;
and
some
speakers
,
using
violent
language
,
lashed
their
hearers
into
a
frenzy
of
mad
excitement
,
causing
an
eager
rush
to
the
barricades
in
readiness
for
the
terrible
fray
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
sun
shone
out
pale
and
yellow
in
the
stormy
sky
,
the
fighting
spread
quickly
down
the
Mersey
banks
from
Haughton
away
to
Flixton
.
<EOS>
It
became
fiercest
around
Stockport
,
and
over
the
level
pastures
the
white
smoke
of
rifles
puffed
from
every
bush
,
wall
,
and
fence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Russians
were
the
superior
force
,
for
,
while
all
were
trained
soldiers
,
not
more
than
a
third
of
the
defenders
had
taken
the
Queen
's
shilling
,
and
not
more
than
half
of
them
had
ever
had
an
hour
's
drill
in
their
lives
.
<EOS>
They
were
simply
volunteers
who
had
found
their
own
arms
and
banded
for
the
defence
of
their
homes
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
of
the
Tsar
,
trained
under
the
most
rigorous
discipline
,
had
considerably
improved
in
tactics
,
in
drill
,
and
in
munitions
of
war
since
the
Crimea,--a
fact
overlooked
by
the
majority
of
Britons,--and
they
had
now
taken
possession
of
every
strategical
position
where
batteries
might
be
established
.
<EOS>
After
fierce
fighting
over
Lyme
Park
across
to
Norbury
Hall
,
in
which
the
Russians
lost
very
heavily
owing
to
the
British
gun
fire
from
the
railway
embankment
,
a
great
charge
was
made
by
an
enormous
body
of
infantry
,
who
succeeded
,
after
several
futile
attempts
,
in
carrying
the
position
,
and
driving
the
British
artillerymen
back
to
the
road
which
runs
from
Stockport
to
Marple
.
 
<EOS>
The
embankment
which
thus
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
Muscovite
infantry
formed
one
of
the
strongest
defences
of
Stockport
,
therefore
they
at
once
moved
the
guns
up
towards
Davenport
Station
,
and
commenced
shelling
the
city
with
the
defenders
'
own
guns
!
 
<EOS>
The
panic
caused
in
Stockport
was
awful
,
when
without
warning
shells
commenced
to
explode
in
the
crowded
barricaded
streets
,
but
the
Russians
were
not
allowed
to
have
things
their
own
way
for
long
.
<EOS>
The
British
batteries
on
the
opposite
railway
embankment
between
Heaton
Norris
and
New
Mills
formed
up
at
the
junction
almost
opposite
Davenport
,
and
opened
a
terrific
fire
upon
the
captured
guns
.
 
<EOS>
For
half
an
hour
this
continued
,
and
the
Russians
,
standing
in
an
exposed
position
right
on
the
sky
-
line
,
were
being
swept
away
by
British
shells
,
when
suddenly
the
enemy
were
joined
by
reinforcements
,
whereupon
a
small
force
of
British
infantry
,
who
had
been
brought
quickly
along
,
unperceived
by
the
enemy
from
Marple
,
suddenly
swarmed
up
the
embankment
at
Norbury
,
and
,
charging
along
to
the
Russian
position
,
added
a
strong
rifle
fire
to
that
of
their
artillery
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
commanding
the
British
batteries
watched
the
infantry
advance
through
his
field
glass
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
suddenly
ceased
his
fire
,
so
as
to
allow
the
infantry
to
make
the
dash
for
which
they
were
preparing
.
<EOS>
A
heliograph
signal
was
flashed
from
the
batteries
,
and
then
,
without
hesitation
,
the
order
was
given
to
charge
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
terribly
exciting
moment
.
<EOS>
If
they
succeeded
they
would
in
all
probability
save
Stockport
.
<EOS>
If
they
were
driven
back
the
town
was
doomed
.
 
<EOS>
With
admirable
pluck
the
British
rushed
upon
the
guns
,
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
fierce
struggle
hand
to
hand
.
<EOS>
Russians
,
although
making
a
most
desperate
stand
,
were
every
moment
being
impaled
on
British
bayonets
,
or
,
pierced
by
bullets
,
they
rolled
down
the
slopes
into
ditches
covered
in
stagnant
slime
.
<EOS>
Hacked
to
pieces
by
the
small
but
gallant
force
of
Britons
,
the
enemy
were
forced
at
last
to
give
in
and
retire
,
leaving
more
than
half
their
number
killed
;
but
with
admirable
tact
,
the
fugitives
were
forced
down
the
bank
nearest
the
British
batteries
.
<EOS>
Thus
they
fell
into
a
trap
,
for
as
soon
as
they
attempted
to
recover
themselves
,
and
make
a
dash
to
reorganise
their
line
of
communications
,
two
British
Maxims
uttered
their
sharp
rattle
,
and
the
whole
force
were
simply
mowed
down
where
they
stood
.
 
<EOS>
The
fight
had
been
a
most
desperate
one
,
but
,
thanks
to
the
heroic
charge
of
the
British
infantry
,
Stockport
was
again
safe
,
and
the
guns
once
more
in
the
hands
of
her
defenders
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
fighting
of
the
fiercest
possible
description
was
taking
place
across
the
meadows
lying
between
Norbury
and
Bramhall
,
and
the
Russians
,
unable
to
withstand
the
withering
British
fire
,
were
gradually
forced
back
to
Cheadle
Hulme
,
where
they
were
surprised
by
the
defenders
and
utterly
routed
.
<EOS>
So
great
was
the
slaughter
,
that
it
is
estimated
that
in
this
engagement
alone
,
after
the
recapture
of
the
guns
by
the
British
,
over
4000
Russians
were
shot
down
and
3000
taken
prisoners
!
 
<EOS>
The
Russians
,
finding
how
desperate
was
the
resistance
,
and
how
heavily
they
were
losing
,
quickly
brought
up
strong
reinforcements
upon
Cheadle
,
and
,
after
a
fiercely
-
contested
conflict
,
succeeded
in
driving
back
the
small
British
force
,
they
being
compelled
to
retreat
back
over
the
Mersey
to
Parr
's
Wood
and
Didsbury
,
afterwards
blowing
up
the
bridges
,
and
keeping
up
a
hot
fire
from
the
bank
,
where
a
large
body
of
Volunteers
were
already
entrenched
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
,
although
they
were
unable
to
save
Cheadle
from
being
burned
,
they
succeeded
,
by
reason
of
the
excellence
of
their
position
and
the
admirable
tactics
they
displayed
,
in
mowing
down
another
2000
of
the
Tsar
's
soldiers
.
<EOS>
In
this
instance
the
laurels
remained
with
a
portion
of
the
Manchester
Volunteer
Brigade
,
the
effect
of
whose
rifle
fire
was
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
now
about
ten
o'clock
,
and
the
sky
had
cleared
for
a
brilliant
day
.
<EOS>
At
Chapel
-
en
-
le
-
Frith
a
large
detachment
of
Cossacks
had
been
swept
away
by
a
body
of
British
Hussars
who
had
suddenly
descended
upon
Whitehough
,
while
almost
at
the
same
moment
a
British
battery
that
had
been
hastily
established
on
Chinley
Churn
succeeded
in
wiping
out
a
body
of
infantry
that
was
advancing
with
all
speed
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Yeardsley
Hall
.
<EOS>
But
one
of
the
most
sanguinary
portions
of
the
battle
was
the
conflict
which
spread
westward
from
Cheadle
across
to
Altrincham
,
Lymm
,
and
Warrington
.
<EOS>
Already
Altrincham
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
The
fine
villas
of
wealthy
Manchester
tradesmen
and
manufacturers
,
deserted
by
their
owners
,
had
been
entered
by
the
uncouth
Muscovites
and
sacked
.
<EOS>
Every
nook
and
corner
had
been
searched
for
plate
,
jewellery
,
and
money
,
paintings
had
been
ruthlessly
torn
down
,
furniture
broken
and
burned
,
and
Russian
troopers
had
made
merry
in
many
a
handsome
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Old
Field
Hall
and
Timperly
Hall
had
both
been
ransacked
and
set
on
fire
with
petroleum
,
while
every
house
at
Dunham
Massey
had
been
destroyed
by
incendiaries
.
 
<EOS>
Elated
over
their
successes
,
the
Russians
were
collecting
their
forces
preparatory
to
a
decisive
rush
over
the
Mersey
to
Stretford
,
intending
to
take
that
place
,
and
advance
by
that
route
upon
Manchester
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
who
had
been
warned
of
this
through
spies
,
awaited
their
chance
,
and
suddenly
,
when
the
Russians
least
expected
an
attack
,
a
body
of
British
cavalry
,
backed
by
infantry
,
crossed
the
Mersey
,
and
sweeping
down
the
level
turnpike
road
to
Sale
,
came
upon
their
opponents
before
they
were
aware
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
A
small
body
of
British
Hussars
,
with
some
Lancashire
Yeomanry
,
made
a
splendid
charge
,
exhibiting
magnificent
courage
,
and
cut
their
way
clean
through
the
Russian
lines
with
irresistible
force
;
while
the
infantry
,
advancing
cautiously
,
and
taking
every
advantage
of
the
small
cover
afforded
on
that
level
country
,
poured
forth
a
deadly
rifle
fire
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
so
gallant
was
this
charge
,
that
the
Tsar
's
forces
were
almost
annihilated
.
<EOS>
They
endeavoured
to
make
a
stand
near
the
cross
-
roads
leading
from
Carrington
Moss
,
but
the
rifle
fire
of
the
defenders
was
so
heavy
that
they
dropped
by
hundreds
under
the
deadly
rain
of
British
bullets
.
 
<EOS>
The
disaster
to
the
Russians
being
signalled
back
by
them
to
their
reserves
at
Tatton
Park
and
around
Knutsford
,
had
the
effect
of
bringing
up
an
enormous
force
of
infantry
.
<EOS>
Signallers
were
at
work
in
all
directions
,
and
those
who
watched
the
progress
of
the
action
found
the
next
two
hours
full
of
exciting
moments
.
<EOS>
It
was
apparent
at
once
that
the
Russians
had
marked
out
Stretford
as
the
gate
by
which
they
intended
to
enter
Manchester
,
but
they
must
have
been
misled
by
their
spies
as
to
the
strength
of
the
defenders
in
this
direction
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
they
had
surveyed
the
whole
of
the
southern
line
defending
the
city
,
they
could
not
have
discovered
a
point
more
strongly
fortified
;
therefore
it
was
a
somewhat
curious
fact
that
they
should
have
concentrated
their
forces
upon
that
part
.
<EOS>
Possibly
it
was
because
they
had
formed
an
opinion
by
studying
their
Ordnance
Maps
--
so
generously
provided
for
them
by
the
British
Department
of
Agriculture
at
a
cost
of
one
shilling
each
--
that
,
if
they
succeeded
in
breaking
the
defence
at
Stretford
,
they
would
also
secure
the
road
running
in
a
circular
direction
up
to
Barton
,
by
which
means
they
could
enter
Manchester
by
way
of
Eccles
,
Pendleton
,
and
Salford
at
the
same
time
as
the
march
through
Trafford
.
<EOS>
Such
a
design
was
,
of
course
,
cleverly
planned
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
admitted
that
,
from
a
strategical
point
of
view
,
the
taking
of
Stretford
would
mean
the
fall
of
Manchester
,
a
fact
which
the
Russian
commanding
officer
had
not
overlooked
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
soldiers
of
the
Tsar
had
reckoned
without
their
hosts
.
<EOS>
They
only
saw
along
the
Mersey
a
thin
and
apparently
weak
line
of
defence
,
a
massing
of
defenders
without
undue
ostentation
and
without
any
particular
show
of
strength
.
<EOS>
A
balloon
sent
up
by
the
Russians
to
reconnoitre
from
Sale
had
been
fired
at
and
brought
down
by
the
defenders
,
but
with
this
exception
scarcely
a
shot
had
been
fired
north
of
the
Mersey
.
<EOS>
Britons
were
watching
and
waiting
.
<EOS>
Their
foe
,
ridiculing
the
idea
that
a
town
like
Manchester
,
almost
utterly
devoid
of
positions
whereon
batteries
might
be
established
,
could
be
successfully
defended
,
therefore
kept
up
a
desultory
fire
upon
the
British
detachment
that
had
swept
away
their
advance
guard
,
in
the
meantime
covering
the
massing
of
their
enormous
force
.
<EOS>
This
latter
consisted
of
Cossacks
,
guards
,
infantry
,
artillery
,
and
two
companies
of
engineers
,
with
pontoon
sections
,
as
well
as
a
ballooning
party
and
two
field
hospitals
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
detachment
that
had
crossed
the
river
were
,
however
,
unaware
of
the
enemy
's
intention
until
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
manoeuvres
of
the
Russians
were
being
watched
by
a
British
balloon
sent
up
from
Old
Trafford
,
but
the
signals
made
by
the
aeronaut
were
unfortunately
unobserved
by
the
party
,
so
desperately
were
they
fighting
;
otherwise
a
disaster
which
befell
them
on
the
sudden
rush
of
the
enemy
towards
the
river
might
possibly
have
been
averted
.
<EOS>
However
,
no
blame
could
be
attached
to
the
officer
in
charge
of
the
detachment
.
<EOS>
The
men
acted
their
part
bravely
,
and
displayed
that
courage
of
which
the
Briton
speaks
with
justifiable
pride
,
even
though
,
alas
!
<EOS>
they
fell
,
every
one
of
them
fighting
till
the
last
,
their
bodies
being
afterwards
frightfully
mangled
by
horses
'
hoofs
,
as
hundreds
of
Cossacks
rode
over
them
.
<EOS>
Not
a
man
of
that
party
escaped
,
but
each
one
had
once
more
shown
the
world
what
pluck
and
courage
could
accomplish
,
and
had
gone
to
his
grave
as
a
sacrifice
for
his
country
and
his
Queen
.

GALLANT
DEEDS
BY
CYCLISTS
.
  
<EOS>
Noon
came
and
went
.
<EOS>
The
fighting
grew
fiercer
around
Manchester
,
and
the
excitement
more
intense
within
the
barricaded
,
starving
city
.
<EOS>
Through
the
wildly
agitated
crowds
of
women
of
all
classes
,
from
manufacturers
'
wives
to
factory
girls
,
who
moved
up
and
down
Deansgate
,
Market
Street
,
and
many
other
principal
thoroughfares
,
feverishly
anxious
for
the
safety
of
their
husbands
and
brothers
manning
the
improvised
defences
,
rumours
of
terrible
disaster
spread
like
wildfire
,
and
caused
loud
wailing
and
lamentation
.
 
<EOS>
Now
rumour
told
of
huge
British
successes
away
beyond
the
Mersey
,
a
report
which
elated
the
pale
-
faced
hungry
ones
,
but
this
being
followed
quickly
by
a
further
report
that
a
force
of
the
defenders
had
been
cut
up
and
utterly
annihilated
outside
Eccles
,
the
cheering
died
away
,
and
give
place
to
deep
,
long
-
drawn
sighs
and
murmurings
of
despair
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
dusty
,
perspiring
throngs
<EOS>
the
hot
noonday
sun
beat
down
mercilessly
,
the
low
rumbling
of
artillery
sounded
gradually
closer
and
more
distinct
,
and
the
smoke
of
burning
buildings
in
Sale
and
Altrincham
slowly
ascending
hung
in
the
clear
sky
a
black
ominous
cloud
.
 
<EOS>
By
about
two
o'clock
the
line
of
defence
south
of
the
Mersey
had
been
nearly
all
withdrawn
,
leaving
,
however
,
the
defending
line
running
south
-
east
of
Stockport
to
Buxton
and
the
Peak
.
<EOS>
Although
Cheadle
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
's
hands
,
an
English
battery
,
established
near
the
railway
at
Bamford
,
commanded
the
road
from
Cheadle
to
Stockport
,
and
British
infantry
,
supported
by
artillery
,
were
strongly
entrenched
from
Bramhall
Moor
through
Norbury
,
Poynton
,
Wardsend
,
Booth
Green
,
and
Bollington
,
then
turning
east
through
Macclesfield
Forest
to
Buxton
.
<EOS>
This
line
was
being
hourly
strengthened
,
and
although
not
strong
enough
to
take
the
offensive
,
it
was
too
strong
for
the
Russians
to
attack
.
 
<EOS>
[

<EOS>
All
the
bridges
over
the
Mersey
,
from
Glazebrook
to
Stockport
,
had
been
prepared
for
demolition
,
but
it
was
not
intended
to
carry
this
out
except
as
a
last
resource
.
<EOS>
Cavalry
and
cyclist
scouts
who
were
left
on
the
south
of
the
Mersey
had
withdrawn
across
the
bridges
,
after
exchanging
shots
with
the
skirmishers
of
the
advance
guards
of
the
enemy
who
quickly
lined
the
banks
.
<EOS>
The
bridges
north
of
Cheadle
were
then
blown
up
,
and
the
defenders
were
well
posted
in
Parr
Wood
,
near
where
it
was
believed
the
enemy
would
attempt
to
ford
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
Russians
contented
themselves
with
exchanging
a
few
shots
with
the
defenders
until
half
an
hour
later
,
when
some
of
their
batteries
had
been
established
,
and
then
the
passage
of
the
Mersey
at
Northenden
was
commenced
,
under
cover
of
the
guns
of
the
Russians
near
the
Convalescent
Hospital
,
north
of
Cheadle
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Russian
scouts
approached
the
river
three
British
outposts
could
be
seen
in
the
wood
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
however
,
driven
in
by
some
Cossacks
,
who
forded
the
river
and
attempted
to
enter
the
wood
,
but
were
all
immediately
killed
by
hidden
skirmishers
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
engineers
were
meanwhile
busy
building
a
pontoon
bridge
,
which
they
soon
completed
,
and
they
then
crossed
after
a
short
opposition
,
rapidly
deploying
to
right
and
left
in
order
to
surround
Didsbury
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
the
first
force
to
cross
the
Mersey
,
consisted
of
two
battalions
of
the
Kazan
Regiment
and
two
battalions
of
the
Vladimir
,
with
two
9-pounder
and
one
6-pounder
field
batteries
and
100
cavalry
.
<EOS>
Didsbury
had
been
put
in
a
state
of
hasty
defence
,
and
was
held
by
two
battalions
of
the
defenders
,
who
also
established
a
Volunteer
battery
at
Bank
Hall
,
and
lined
the
railway
embankment
in
force
as
far
as
Chorlton
-
with
-
Hardy
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
battery
at
the
Convalescent
Home
had
rendered
the
wood
almost
untenable
,
but
it
was
soon
silenced
by
the
well
-
directed
fire
of
the
British
Volunteer
battery
,
and
the
wood
was
then
re
-
entered
by
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
however
,
a
large
number
of
the
enemy
had
taken
up
positions
in
it
,
and
the
British
were
once
more
gradually
driven
back
.
 
<EOS>
One
section
,
consisting
of
six
cyclists
,
with
a
light
machine
gun
mounted
on
a
double
cycle
,
was
told
off
under
Sergeant
Irons
of
the
Royal
Lancaster
,
to
defend
a
junction
of
two
paths
about
half
-
way
through
the
dense
wood
,
and
as
the
latter
was
still
occupied
by
the
defenders
,
the
enemy
could
only
make
slow
progress
,
and
the
cavalry
could
only
move
by
the
paths
.
 
<EOS>
Irons
,
taking
advantage
of
a
bend
in
the
path
,
dismounted
his
men
,
who
,
having
drawn
up
their
cycles
under
cover
,
were
formed
up
each
side
of
the
road
to
support
the
gun
.
<EOS>
About
thirty
Russian
dragoons
,
with
their
infantry
,
who
were
working
through
the
wood
,
were
soon
upon
them
,
and
,
seeing
such
a
small
force
barring
the
way
,
the
cavalry
charged
.
 
<EOS>
They
,
however
,
met
with
such
a
terribly
hot
reception
that
only
two
reached
the
guns
,
and
these
were
immediately
shot
.
<EOS>
The
stand
made
by
these
seven
men
was
a
most
noteworthy
instance
of
the
indomitable
courage
of
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
In
those
critical
moments
they
remained
calm
and
collected
,
obeying
the
orders
of
their
sergeant
as
coolly
as
if
they
had
been
drilling
in
the
barrack
square
.
<EOS>
But
their
position
was
one
of
momentarily
increasing
peril
,
for
bullets
whistled
about
them
,
and
the
force
against
them
was
an
overwhelming
one
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
horses
and
men
who
had
fallen
blocked
the
road
,
and
Irons
therefore
gave
the
order
to
fall
in
,
as
the
sound
of
firing
had
now
drawn
many
of
the
enemy
's
skirmishers
towards
the
spot
.
 
<EOS>
Irons
then
re
-
formed
his
squad
,
one
of
whom
had
been
shot
and
another
wounded
,
and
,
taking
the
wounded
man
with
them
,
retired
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
were
moving
off
the
corporal
was
wounded
in
the
shoulder
,
and
Irons
himself
received
a
bullet
in
the
left
arm
.
<EOS>
About
two
hundred
yards
nearer
Didsbury
<EOS>
there
was
a
clearing
,
with
farm
buildings
on
both
sides
of
the
road
,
and
these
had
been
loopholed
and
occupied
by
a
small
force
of
Volunteers
.
<EOS>
Irons
,
sending
the
wounded
man
on
to
Didsbury
,
remained
here
with
his
gun
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
the
position
was
vigorously
attacked
.
 
<EOS>
The
conflict
which
ensued
was
of
the
fiercest
description
.
<EOS>
The
mere
handful
of
defenders
fought
with
such
desperate
courage
that
the
great
body
of
Russians
which
surrounded
them
were
from
the
first
moment
gradually
swept
away
by
the
steady
and
precise
fire
from
the
farm
.
<EOS>
Around
the
buildings
the
enemy
swarmed
in
overwhelming
numbers
,
but
every
man
who
showed
himself
was
promptly
picked
off
by
Britons
shooting
almost
as
coolly
as
if
they
were
competing
for
prizes
at
Bisley
.
 
<EOS>
Sergeant
Irons
'
small
machine
gun
,
with
its
single
barrel
,
rattled
out
continuously
,
shedding
its
rain
of
lead
in
all
directions
,
while
from
muzzles
of
Martini
rifles
peeping
over
walls
and
from
windows
there
came
a
continuous
stream
of
bullets
,
which
played
frightful
havoc
with
the
foe
.
<EOS>
Within
the
first
ten
minutes
two
men
of
the
defending
force
had
been
shot
dead
and
one
wounded
;
still
,
their
comrades
never
lost
heart
,
for
they
were
determined
that
their
position
should
never
fall
into
the
enemy
's
hands
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
officer
who
was
directing
the
operations
of
the
attacking
party
rose
and
shouted
in
Russian
to
encourage
his
men
,
but
in
a
moment
an
English
bullet
struck
him
,
and
,
with
a
loud
cry
,
he
fell
forward
over
the
body
of
a
dragoon
,
shot
through
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
The
stand
the
cyclists
and
their
companions
made
was
unparalleled
.
<EOS>
They
fought
on
heroically
,
knowing
the
importance
of
the
position
they
held
,
and
how
,
if
it
were
taken
,
other
and
more
serious
British
casualties
must
follow
.
<EOS>
Firing
steadily
and
with
caution
,
they
displayed
such
bravery
that
even
the
Russians
themselves
were
compelled
to
secretly
admire
them
;
and
at
last
,
after
nearly
half
an
hour
's
desperate
fighting
,
the
Tsar
's
soldiers
found
themselves
so
terribly
cut
up
that
they
were
forced
to
retire
,
leaving
more
than
half
their
number
dead
and
many
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
had
been
in
progress
,
the
British
battery
had
totally
destroyed
the
Russian
pontoon
,
and
thus
all
means
of
retreat
for
this
portion
of
the
invading
force
were
cut
off
.
<EOS>
About
ten
thousand
men
had
crossed
the
river
at
this
point
,
and
although
they
had
deployed
at
first
,
they
had
all
been
gradually
driven
into
the
wood
by
the
fire
from
the
railway
embankment
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
pontoon
was
destroyed
,
the
British
commenced
to
advance
through
the
wood
,
slowly
driving
back
the
Russians
,
who
then
endeavoured
to
make
for
Stretford
along
the
north
bank
of
the
river
;
but
on
seeing
their
intention
a
brigade
of
defenders
was
immediately
pushed
along
the
railway
,
and
two
regiments
of
cavalry
were
hurried
down
the
road
to
Chorlton
.
 
<EOS>
These
succeeded
in
heading
the
enemy
,
and
,
suddenly
swooping
down
,
they
destroyed
the
rest
of
the
Cossacks
who
had
escaped
from
the
wood
,
as
well
as
the
remainder
of
the
force
who
had
attacked
the
farm
.
 
<EOS>
Another
British
battery
was
then
hurried
forward
,
and
after
a
stubborn
fight
the
remainder
of
the
invaders
who
had
crossed
surrendered
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
attack
alone
the
Russians
lost
in
killed
and
wounded
200
cavalry
and
nearly
2000
infantry
and
artillery
,
while
Stretford
and
Stockport
still
remained
safe
.
<EOS>
But
along
the
long
line
east
and
west
the
battle
raged
with
increasing
fierceness
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
was
a
terrible
one
on
every
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
of
Lymm
had
been
sacked
,
and
was
now
burning
,
while
hundreds
of
unoffending
men
,
women
,
and
children
living
in
the
quiet
Cheshire
villages
had
been
wantonly
massacred
by
the
Muscovites
.
<EOS>
The
latter
were
,
however
,
now
suffering
well
-
merited
punishment
,
for
in
this
bloody
battle
they
were
falling
dead
in
hundreds
.

<EOS>
GREAT
BATTLE
ON
THE
MERSEY
.
  
<EOS>
The
long
blazing
day
was
one
of
many
battles
and
much
toilsome
combat
.
 
<EOS>
Fighting
spread
over
a
front
of
nearly
nine
miles
,
and
during
the
engagement
one
wing
of
the
Russians
was
swung
across
three
miles
.
<EOS>
Hour
after
hour
the
tremendous
warfare
raged
between
the
armies
of
Queen
Victoria
and
the
Tsar
,
and
the
bloodshed
was
everywhere
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
Small
parties
of
the
Russian
Telegraph
Corps
had
ferried
over
the
Ship
Canal
and
the
Mersey
near
Latchford
,
and
wires
were
run
out
,
and
posts
established
connecting
the
headquarters
at
Altrincham
,
on
the
south
of
the
river
,
with
the
well
-
advanced
guard
stations
on
the
Liverpool
Road
towards
Manchester
at
Woolstone
,
Hollinfare
,
and
Lower
Irlam
.
 
<EOS>
Sending
forth
a
huge
division
of
infantry
upon
his
left
,
and
three
brigades
of
cavalry
in
the
centre
,
the
Russian
General
struck
hard
at
the
British
line
between
Stretford
and
Chorlton
-
with
-
Hardy
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
beyond
Ashton
-
on
-
Mersey
<EOS>
the
battle
was
also
growing
in
intensity
,
and
rifle
and
cannon
were
noisily
engaged
.
<EOS>
A
strong
force
of
Russian
infantry
was
at
once
pushed
across
to
Partington
,
where
they
succeeded
in
crossing
the
Ship
Canal
and
the
Mersey
,
subsequently
joining
their
advance
guard
at
Lower
Irlam
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
reserves
at
Newton
-
in
-
Makerfield
,
however
,
swept
down
upon
them
,
and
a
terrible
fight
quickly
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
advanced
very
steadily
by
section
rushes
,
keeping
under
good
firing
discipline
as
they
went
,
and
the
enemy
were
driven
on
towards
Flixton
,
where
they
were
simply
swept
away
by
the
12-pounder
batteries
established
there
,
while
at
the
same
time
their
wires
crossing
the
Mersey
were
cut
,
and
communication
with
their
headquarters
thus
interrupted
.
 
<EOS>
While
this
was
in
progress
,
another
and
more
important
attack
was
being
made
on
Stretford
.
<EOS>
The
heavy
artillery
fire
and
the
affairs
of
outposts
in
the
earlier
stages
of
the
battle
had
been
followed
by
a
carefully
-
regulated
long
-
range
fire
of
infantry
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
The
tactics
the
Russians
had
displayed
were
as
follows:--They
had
gradually
developed
their
infantry
in
front
of
the
Stretford
position
,
and
brought
their
pontoons
in
readiness
for
a
dash
over
the
river
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
some
tentative
movements
,
designed
to
feel
the
strength
of
our
forces
massed
at
this
important
point
,
they
apparently
determined
to
carry
it
at
any
cost
.
 
<EOS>
On
their
right
flank
the
enemy
were
losing
very
heavily
.
<EOS>
A
telegraphic
message
received
at
Altrincham
gave
the
headquarters
alarming
news
of
constant
reverses
.
<EOS>
A
strong
force
of
infantry
marching
along
the
banks
of
the
Etherow
from
Compstall
,
intending
to
get
to
Hyde
by
way
of
Mottram
and
Godley
Junction
,
had
been
attacked
by
British
infantry
and
a
couple
of
9-pounders
,
and
totally
annihilated
;
while
at
the
same
time
,
about
a
thousand
men
attacking
a
British
battery
on
the
hill
at
Charlesworth
had
been
cut
up
and
forced
to
retreat
,
being
followed
by
some
Lancers
right
down
to
Ludworth
Houses
,
where
they
were
nearly
all
killed
or
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
times
without
number
during
that
memorable
day
the
Russians
made
fierce
attacks
upon
our
positions
on
the
edge
of
the
Peak
district
,
but
on
each
occasion
they
were
hurled
back
with
fearful
loss
by
the
thin
line
of
defenders
holding
the
high
ground
.
 
<EOS>
A
battery
we
had
established
on
the
crown
of
the
hill
at
Werneth
was
charged
again
and
again
by
Cossacks
and
Dragoons
,
but
our
men
,
displaying
cool
courage
at
the
critical
moments
,
fought
desperately
,
and
mowed
down
the
foe
in
a
manner
that
was
remarkable
.
 
<EOS>
The
Russians
,
having
decided
to
carry
Stretford
,
were
making
vigorous
demonstrations
towards
the
Peak
,
and
in
the
direction
of
Flixton
,
in
order
to
distract
our
attention
.
<EOS>
They
occupied
us
at
many
points
in
the
vast
semicircle
,
and
by
thus
engaging
us
all
along
the
line
,
endeavoured
apparently
to
prevent
us
from
reinforcing
the
point
at
Stretford
which
they
intended
gaining
.
<EOS>
Both
invaders
and
defenders
gradually
extended
in
order
to
meet
outflanking
movements
,
and
this
was
the
cause
of
another
sudden
British
success
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
foregone
conclusion
that
such
an
extension
would
exceed
the
limits
of
defensive
power
on
one
side
or
the
other
,
and
then
blows
would
be
struck
with
the
object
of
breaking
the
too
extended
line
.
 
<EOS>
What
occurred
is
,
perhaps
,
best
related
by
one
of
the
special
correspondents
of
the
_
Daily
News
_
,
who
,
in
his
account
of
the
battle
,
published
two
days
later
,
said--
 
<EOS>
"
About
three
o'clock
I
was
at
Barton
with
the
force
of
infantry
who
were
holding
the
road
to
Warrington
,
when
we
unexpectedly
received
telegraphic
information
from
headquarters
of
a
rapid
extension
of
the
enemy
's
left
flank
.
<EOS>
A
brigade
which
I
accompanied
was
pushed
on
at
once
down
to
Hollinfare
,
where
we
reinforced
those
who
had
been
so
successful
in
cutting
up
the
enemy
at
Lower
Irlam
half
an
hour
before
.
<EOS>
We
then
extended
along
the
Liverpool
Road
,
past
Warrington
,
as
far
as
Widnes
.
<EOS>
I
remained
with
a
small
detachment
at
Hollinfare
awaiting
developments
,
when
suddenly
we
were
informed
that
the
enemy
had
thrown
a
pontoon
bridge
over
the
Mersey
at
its
confluence
with
the
Bollin
,
and
that
a
great
body
of
infantry
,
with
machine
guns
,
had
left
Lymm
,
where
they
had
been
lying
inactive
,
and
were
already
crossing
.
<EOS>
There
were
not
more
than
one
hundred
of
us
,
mostly
men
of
the
Loyal
Lancashire
from
Preston
and
a
few
of
the
Manchester
Regiment
;
but
at
the
word
of
command
we
dashed
down
the
road
for
nearly
a
mile
,
and
then
leaving
it
,
doubled
across
the
fields
to
Rixton
Old
Hall
,
where
we
obtained
cover
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Russians
had
chosen
the
most
advantageous
spot
they
could
find
to
cross
,
for
on
the
opposite
bank
there
was
a
small
thick
wood
,
and
in
this
they
remained
quite
concealed
until
they
suddenly
dashed
out
and
got
across
.
<EOS>
Numbers
had
already
reached
our
side
and
were
deploying
,
when
our
rifles
spoke
out
sharply
,
and
,
judging
from
the
manner
in
which
the
enemy
were
exposed
,
our
fire
was
quite
unexpected
.
<EOS>
About
thirty
of
our
men
,
kneeling
behind
a
wall
,
kept
up
a
vigorous
fire
,
emptying
their
magazines
with
excellent
effect
upon
the
grey
-
coats
swarming
over
the
improvised
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
"
Still
it
was
impossible
to
keep
them
back
,
for
the
force
effecting
a
passage
<EOS>
was
very
much
larger
than
we
had
anticipated
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
few
minutes
later
,
having
ascertained
the
extent
of
the
attack
,
our
signallers
opened
communication
with
Higher
Irlam
,
and
the
information
was
conveyed
on
to
Barton
,
whence
the
heliograph
flashed
the
news
down
to
Stretford
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suddenly
,
however
,
in
the
midst
of
a
shady
clump
of
trees
there
was
a
loud
rattle
and
continuous
flashing
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
brought
a
10-barrelled
Nordenfelt
into
play
,
and
it
was
raining
bullets
upon
us
at
the
rate
of
a
thousand
a
minute
!
 
<EOS>
"
The
wall
behind
which
I
was
crouching
was
struck
by
a
perfect
hail
of
lead
,
and
there
was
a
loud
whistling
about
my
ears
that
was
particularly
disconcerting
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
our
men
had
in
their
sudden
dash
for
the
defence
secured
an
excellent
position
,
and
only
three
were
killed
and
five
wounded
by
this
sudden
outburst
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
struggle
during
the
next
few
minutes
was
the
most
desperate
I
have
ever
witnessed
.
<EOS>
At
the
moment
of
peril
our
men
displayed
magnificent
pluck
.
<EOS>
They
seemed
utterly
unconcerned
at
their
imminent
danger
,
and
lay
or
crouched
,
firing
independently
with
calm
precision
.
<EOS>
A
dozen
or
so
fell
wounded
,
however
,
and
a
sergeant
who
knelt
next
to
me
,
and
who
was
shooting
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
,
was
shot
through
the
heart
,
and
fell
dead
while
in
the
act
of
making
an
observation
to
me
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
men
who
had
attacked
us
were
a
fierce
-
looking
set
,
mostly
composed
of
Tchuwakes
and
Mordwa
from
the
central
district
of
the
Volga
,
and
renowned
as
among
the
best
infantry
that
the
Tsar
can
command
.
 
<EOS>
"
Rifles
bristled
from
every
bit
of
cover
around
us
,
and
it
was
really
marvellous
that
we
scored
such
success
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
only
by
reason
of
the
courageous
conduct
of
every
individual
man
that
the
successful
stand
was
made
against
such
overwhelming
numbers
.
<EOS>
We
knew
that
if
the
enemy
forced
the
passage
and
annihilated
us
,
they
would
then
be
enabled
to
outflank
our
force
,
and
get
round
to
Eccles
and
Pendlebury
--
a
disaster
which
might
result
in
the
rapid
investment
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Therefore
we
fought
on
,
determined
to
do
our
very
utmost
to
stem
the
advancing
tide
of
destroyers
.
 
<EOS>
"
Time
after
time
our
rifles
rattled
,
and
time
after
time
the
deadly
Nordenfelt
sent
its
hail
of
bullets
around
us
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
however
,
we
heard
increased
firing
on
our
right
,
and
then
welcome
signals
reached
us
from
Martinscroft
Green
.
<EOS>
We
greeted
them
with
loud
cheering
,
for
a
force
of
our
infantry
and
cavalry
had
returned
along
the
road
from
Warrington
,
and
,
working
in
extended
order
,
were
bearing
down
upon
the
foe
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
ceased
firing
in
that
direction
,
and
ere
long
we
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
enemy
's
pontoon
blown
up
,
and
then
,
with
their
retreat
cut
off
,
they
became
demoralised
,
and
were
driven
into
the
open
,
where
we
picked
them
off
so
rapidly
that
scarcely
one
man
of
the
1500
who
had
set
his
foot
upon
the
Lancashire
bank
survived
.
 
<EOS>
"
From
first
to
last
our
men
fought
magnificently
.
<EOS>
The
whole
engagement
was
a
brilliant
and
almost
unequalled
display
of
genuine
British
bravery
,
and
all
I
can
hope
is
that
the
defenders
of
London
will
act
their
part
with
equal
courage
when
the
decisive
struggle
comes
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
 
<EOS>
THE
FATE
OF
THE
VANQUISHED
.
  
<EOS>
While
this
vigorous
attack
on
the
right
flank
was
in
progress
,
the
enemy
made
a
sudden
dash
upon
Stretford
.
 
<EOS>
The
edge
of
the
town
itself
--
or
rather
suburb
--
lies
but
a
short
distance
from
the
Mersey
,
and
the
turnpike
road
runs
straight
away
over
the
river
through
Sale
and
Altrincham
to
Northwich
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
town
nearest
the
river
a
road
leading
down
from
Barton
joins
the
main
road
,
and
at
the
junction
is
a
large
red
-
brick
modern
hotel
,
the
Old
Cock
,
while
adjoining
is
the
Manchester
Tramway
Company
's
stable
and
terminus
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
behind
lies
a
high
embankment
,
which
carries
the
railway
from
Manchester
to
Liverpool
,
while
the
Mersey
itself
,
though
not
wide
,
has
steep
banks
with
earthworks
thrown
up
to
prevent
floods
.
<EOS>
Hence
the
force
holding
this
position
found
ready
-
made
defences
which
were
now
of
the
utmost
value
.
 
<EOS>
The
defenders
here
included
three
batteries
of
Royal
Artillery
,
one
battalion
of
the
Manchester
Regiment
,
the
2nd
Volunteer
Battalion
of
the
same
regiment
,
and
one
of
the
Lancashire
Fusiliers
,
a
field
company
of
Engineers
,
half
the
14th
<EOS>
(
King
's
)
Hussars
with
their
machine
gun
section
,
and
a
company
of
signallers
.
<EOS>
Trenches
had
been
dug
at
various
points
,
and
earthworks
thrown
up
all
along
the
line
from
Chorlton
over
to
Flixton
.
<EOS>
Across
the
junction
of
the
two
roads
opposite
the
Old
Cock
a
great
barricade
had
been
constructed
,
and
behind
this
was
a
powerful
battery
that
commanded
the
level
country
away
towards
Altrincham
.
<EOS>
The
bridges
carrying
the
road
and
railway
over
the
river
had
both
been
demolished
by
engineers
,
and
many
other
precautions
had
been
taken
to
prevent
the
enemy
forcing
a
passage
across
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
with
a
swiftness
that
was
surprising
,
the
expected
assault
was
made
.
<EOS>
Its
strength
was
terrific
,
and
the
carnage
on
both
sides
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
dash
across
was
effected
by
the
Russians
from
the
rifle
range
near
Old
Hall
,
and
this
was
rapidly
followed
by
another
from
the
bank
opposite
the
battery
at
Stretford
,
while
further
down
a
third
attack
was
made
near
Mersey
House
,
close
to
Ashton
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
three
,
the
strongest
,
of
course
,
was
that
upon
Stretford
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
,
by
a
good
deal
of
neat
manoeuvring
,
brought
their
main
body
within
the
triangle
bounded
on
the
one
side
by
the
road
from
Cheadle
to
Altrincham
,
on
the
second
by
the
road
from
the
latter
place
to
the
river
,
and
the
third
by
the
river
itself
.
 
<EOS>
Pontoons
were
floated
at
many
points
,
and
while
some
cavalry
forded
the
river
,
infantry
and
artillery
rapidly
crossed
in
the
face
of
a
terrific
fire
which
was
pouring
upon
them
.
 
<EOS>
Smokeless
powder
being
used
,
the
positions
of
the
invaders
were
not
obscured
,
and
it
could
be
seen
that
the
British
were
effecting
terrible
execution
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
the
foe
who
were
in
the
act
of
crossing
were
picked
off
,
and
shells
falling
upon
the
pontoons
destroyed
them
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
were
quickly
replaced
,
and
the
force
of
the
Tsar
,
by
reason
of
the
overwhelming
numbers
that
had
hurled
themselves
upon
Stretford
,
succeeded
,
after
a
desperately
-
contested
fight
,
in
breaking
the
line
of
defence
between
Chorlton
-
with
-
Hardy
and
Fallowfield
,
and
advancing
by
short
rushes
upon
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
British
infantry
in
their
trenches
behaved
splendidly
,
and
made
the
roads
from
Old
Hall
at
Sale
right
along
to
Partington
quite
untenable
,
so
the
continuous
advance
of
the
enemy
cost
them
very
dearly
.
 
<EOS>
Russian
shells
bursting
in
Stretford
killed
and
injured
large
numbers
of
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
Two
of
them
struck
the
Old
Cock
in
rapid
succession
,
almost
completely
demolishing
it
,
but
the
debris
was
quickly
manned
,
and
rifles
soon
spoke
from
its
ruined
walls
.
<EOS>
Again
,
a
shell
exploding
in
the
large
tram
stables
,
set
a
hay
store
on
fire
,
and
this
burned
furiously
,
while
away
in
the
centre
of
the
town
the
Public
Library
and
a
number
of
shops
in
the
vicinity
had
also
been
ignited
in
a
similar
manner
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
thousands
of
grey
-
coats
swarming
over
the
country
fell
in
such
enormous
numbers
upon
the
British
rifle
pits
on
the
Mersey
bank
,
that
the
first
line
of
defence
was
at
length
utterly
broken
down
;
but
in
doing
this
the
enemy
's
front
had
become
much
exposed
,
whereupon
the
Maxims
on
the
railway
embankment
between
the
river
and
Barton
suddenly
burst
forth
a
perfect
hail
of
bullets
,
and
in
a
short
time
a
whole
division
of
Russian
infantry
,
cavalry
,
and
artillery
had
been
literally
swept
out
of
existence
.
 
<EOS>
The
batteries
down
in
the
Stretford
Road
,
combined
with
those
on
the
embankment
,
had
up
to
this
moment
played
greater
havoc
with
the
foe
than
any
other
.
<EOS>
The
men
of
the
Manchester
Regiment
,
both
Regulars
and
Volunteers
,
were
displaying
the
greatest
coolness
;
but
unfortunately
the
Lancashire
Fusiliers
and
the
Loyal
North
Lancashire
,
who
had
manned
the
trenches
,
had
been
partially
annihilated
,
the
majority
lying
dead
,
their
bodies
scattered
over
the
level
fields
and
roads
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
notwithstanding
the
strenuous
opposition
of
the
British
batteries
at
this
point
,
the
Russians
were
bringing
up
huge
reinforcements
from
Altrincham
,
Cheadle
,
and
Northenden
,
and
by
establishing
strong
batteries
commanding
Stretford
,
they
at
last
,
about
five
o'clock
,
succeeded
in
killing
nearly
half
the
gallant
defenders
,
and
driving
back
the
survivors
up
the
Barton
Road
.
 
<EOS>
The
tide
of
grey
-
coats
rushing
onward
,
captured
the
British
guns
,
and
although
the
batteries
on
the
railway
embankment
still
held
out
,
and
the
enemy
suffered
heavily
from
their
Maxims
,
yet
they
pressed
on
into
Stretford
town
,
and
commenced
to
sack
it
.
<EOS>
Messrs.
Williams
,
Deacon
's
Bank
,
was
entered
,
the
safes
blown
open
,
and
large
sums
in
gold
and
notes
abstracted
,
shops
were
entered
and
looted
,
and
houses
ransacked
for
jewellery
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
Stretford
fell
.
 
<EOS>
Its
streets
ran
with
blood
;
and
on
,
over
the
bodies
of
its
brave
defenders
,
the
hordes
of
the
Great
White
Tsar
marched
towards
Manchester
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
British
batteries
on
the
railway
embankment
had
also
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
Russians
,
who
were
now
driving
the
survivors
over
towards
Barton
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
,
however
,
retreat
without
a
most
desperate
resistance
.
<EOS>
A
row
of
thatched
and
white
-
washed
cottages
at
the
bend
of
the
road
they
held
for
a
long
time
,
emptying
their
magazine
rifles
with
deadly
effect
upon
their
pursuers
,
but
at
last
they
were
driven
north
,
and
half
an
hour
later
joined
their
comrades
who
had
massed
at
Barton
,
but
who
had
been
attacked
in
great
force
and
fallen
back
in
good
order
to
Pendleton
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
enemy
,
having
pierced
the
line
of
outposts
,
had
occupied
Barton
and
Eccles
.
<EOS>
At
the
former
place
they
had
set
on
fire
a
number
of
factories
,
and
out
of
mere
desire
to
cause
as
much
damage
to
property
as
possible
,
they
had
blown
up
both
the
bridge
that
carried
the
road
over
the
Ship
Canal
,
and
also
destroyed
the
magnificent
swinging
aqueduct
which
carried
the
Bridgewater
Canal
over
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
This
great
triumph
of
engineering
--
one
of
the
most
successful
feats
of
the
decade
--
was
blown
into
the
air
by
charges
of
gun
-
cotton
,
and
now
lay
across
the
Ship
Canal
a
heap
of
fallen
masonry
and
twisted
iron
cantilevers
,
while
the
water
from
the
Bridgewater
Canal
was
pouring
out
in
thousands
of
tons
,
threatening
to
flood
the
surrounding
district
,
and
the
church
opposite
had
been
wrecked
by
the
terrific
force
of
the
explosion
.
 
<EOS>
A
frightful
panic
had
been
caused
in
Manchester
by
these
reverses
.
<EOS>
The
scenes
in
the
streets
were
indescribable
.
<EOS>
At
the
barricades
,
however
,
the
enemy
met
with
a
desperate
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
Three
great
columns
were
marching
on
Manchester
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
having
broken
the
line
of
defence
near
Fallowfield
,
divided
into
two
divisions
;
one
,
advancing
up
the
Wilmslow
Road
,
stormed
the
great
barricade
opposite
Rusholme
Hall
,
while
the
other
appeared
on
the
Withington
Road
,
and
commenced
to
engage
the
defences
that
had
been
thrown
across
Moss
Lane
and
Chorlton
Road
.
<EOS>
The
second
column
advanced
to
where
Eccles
Old
Road
joins
Broad
Street
at
Pendleton
;
and
the
third
,
sweeping
along
up
the
Stretford
Road
,
met
with
a
terrific
resistance
at
the
Botanic
Gardens
at
Trafford
,
the
walls
of
which
,
on
either
side
of
the
road
,
were
loopholed
and
manned
by
infantry
and
artillery
;
while
opposite
,
the
Blind
Asylum
was
held
by
a
regiment
of
infantry
,
and
a
strong
barricade
,
with
a
battery
of
12-pounders
,
had
been
established
a
little
further
towards
the
city
,
at
the
junction
of
the
Chester
and
Stretford
New
Roads
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
advanced
here
in
enormous
force
;
but
,
seeing
the
formidable
defences
,
a
number
of
cavalry
and
infantry
turned
off
along
the
Trafford
Road
,
blew
up
the
bridge
of
the
Ship
Canal
in
order
to
prevent
a
pursuing
force
of
British
cavalry
from
following
,
and
after
setting
fire
to
the
great
dock
warehouses
and
crowd
of
idle
ships
,
continued
along
to
Eccles
New
Road
,
where
,
however
,
they
were
met
by
another
force
of
our
Hussars
,
and
totally
routed
and
cut
up
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
point
the
tide
of
battle
turned
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
half
-
past
five
,
and
the
sun
was
sinking
when
the
Russian
forces
prepared
for
their
final
onslaught
.
<EOS>
Cossacks
and
Dragoons
charged
again
and
again
,
and
infantry
with
bayonets
fixed
rushed
onward
to
the
barricades
in
huge
grey
legions
,
only
to
be
met
by
a
sweeping
rain
of
British
bullets
,
which
filled
the
roads
with
great
heaps
of
dead
.
<EOS>
In
these
defences
,
rendered
doubly
strong
by
the
patriotic
action
of
the
stalwart
civilians
of
Manchester
,
the
invaders
could
make
no
breach
,
and
before
every
one
of
them
they
fell
in
thousands
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
in
the
entrenchments
saw
the
foe
were
falling
back
,
and
found
the
attack
growing
weaker
.
<EOS>
Then
signals
were
made
,
and
they
raised
a
long
hearty
cheer
when
the
truth
was
flashed
to
them
.

ATTACKING
THE
BARRICADE

]
 
<EOS>
The
news
was
inspiriting
,
and
they
fought
on
with
redoubled
energy
,
for
they
knew
that
the
great
body
of
reserves
from
Ashton
-
under
-
Lyne
,
Hyde
,
and
Compstall
,
as
well
as
those
who
had
been
occupying
the
hills
on
the
edge
of
the
Peak
,
had
been
pushed
right
past
Stretford
to
Barton
,
and
were
now
advancing
like
a
huge
fan
,
outflanking
the
Russians
and
attacking
them
in
their
rear
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
tactics
were
excellent
,
for
while
the
invaders
were
attacked
by
cavalry
and
infantry
on
the
one
side
,
the
defenders
manning
the
barricades
made
a
sudden
sortie
,
cutting
their
way
into
them
with
<EOS>
bayonet
rushes
which
they
could
not
withstand
,
and
which
had
a
terribly
fatal
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
Tsar
's
forces
,
unable
to
advance
or
retreat
,
and
being
thus
completely
surrounded
,
still
fought
on
,
and
as
they
refused
to
surrender
,
were
literally
massacred
by
thousands
by
British
troops
,
while
many
guns
and
horses
were
captured
,
thousands
of
rounds
of
ammunition
seized
,
and
many
men
taken
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
The
fight
in
that
evening
hour
was
the
most
fiercely
contested
of
any
during
that
day
.
<EOS>
The
fate
of
Manchester
was
in
the
hands
of
our
gallant
soldiers
,
who
,
although
necessarily
losing
heavily
before
such
an
enormous
army
,
behaved
with
a
courage
that
was
magnificent
,
and
which
was
deserving
the
highest
commendation
that
could
be
bestowed
.
 
<EOS>
As
dusk
gathered
into
darkness
,
the
enemy
were
being
forced
back
towards
the
Mersey
over
the
roads
they
had
so
recently
travelled
,
but
still
fighting
,
selling
their
lives
dearly
.
<EOS>
The
highways
and
fields
were
strewn
with
their
dead
and
dying
,
for
while
infantry
fired
into
their
front
from
the
cover
of
houses
and
walls
,
our
cavalry
,
with
whirling
sabres
,
fell
upon
them
and
hacked
them
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Neither
Cossacks
nor
Dragoons
proved
a
match
for
our
Hussars
,
Lancers
,
and
Yeomanry
,
and
even
in
face
of
the
machine
guns
which
the
Russians
brought
into
play
in
an
endeavour
to
break
the
line
and
escape
,
our
infantry
dashed
on
with
grand
and
magnificent
charges
,
quickly
seizing
the
Nordenfelts
,
turning
their
own
guns
against
them
,
and
letting
loose
a
fire
that
mowed
down
hundreds
.
 
<EOS>
Across
the
neighbouring
country
our
forces
swept
in
good
attack
formation
,
and
all
along
that
great
line
,
nearly
six
miles
in
length
,
the
slaughter
of
Russians
was
frightful
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
falling
gloom
fire
flashed
from
the
muzzles
of
rifles
,
cannon
,
and
machine
guns
,
and
far
above
the
terrible
din
sounded
shrill
cries
of
pain
and
hoarse
shouts
of
despair
as
the
great
Army
that
had
devastated
our
beloved
country
with
fire
and
sword
was
gradually
annihilated
.
<EOS>
In
those
roads
in
the
south
of
the
city
the
scenes
of
bloodshed
were
awful
,
as
a
force
of
over
20,000
Russians
were
slaughtered
because
they
would
not
yield
up
their
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Outside
Stretford
<EOS>
a
last
desperate
stand
was
made
,
but
ere
long
some
British
cavalry
came
thundering
along
,
and
cut
them
down
in
a
frightful
manner
,
while
about
the
same
time
a
Russian
flying
column
was
annihilated
over
at
Davy
-
Hulme
;
away
at
Carrington
a
retreating
brigade
of
infantry
which
had
escaped
over
the
river
was
suddenly
pounced
upon
by
the
defenders
and
slaughtered
;
and
at
Altrincham
the
enemy
's
headquarters
were
occupied
,
and
the
staff
taken
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Ere
the
Russian
General
could
be
forced
to
surrender
,
however
,
he
placed
a
revolver
to
his
head
,
and
in
full
view
of
a
number
of
his
officers
,
blew
his
brains
out
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
moon
shone
out
from
behind
a
dark
bank
of
cloud
just
before
midnight
,
she
shed
her
pale
light
upon
the
wide
battlefield
on
both
sides
of
the
Mersey
,
whereon
lay
the
bodies
of
no
fewer
than
30,000
Russians
and
12,000
British
,
while
40,000
Russians
and
16,000
British
lay
wounded
,
nearly
10,000
Russians
having
been
disarmed
and
marched
into
the
centre
of
the
city
as
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
The
victory
had
only
been
achieved
at
the
eleventh
hour
by
dint
of
great
courage
and
forethought
,
and
being
so
swift
and
effectual
<EOS>
it
was
magnificent
.
 
<EOS>
Manchester
was
safe
,
and
the
public
rejoicings
throughout
that
night
were
unbounded
.
 
<EOS>
The
loss
of
life
was
too
awful
for
reflection
,
for
12,000
of
Britain
's
heroes
--
men
who
had
won
the
battle
--
were
lying
with
their
white
lifeless
faces
upturned
to
the
twinkling
stars

<EOS>
A
SHABBY
WAYFARER
.
  
<EOS>
In
Sussex
the
situation
was
now
most
critical
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
between
the
French
invaders
and
the
line
of
Volunteers
defending
London
was
long
and
desperate
,
but
our
civilian
soldiers
were
bearing
their
part
bravely
,
showing
how
Britons
could
fight
,
and
day
after
day
repelling
the
repeated
assaults
with
a
vigour
that
at
once
proved
their
efficiency
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
after
the
battle
at
Manchester
had
been
fought
and
won
,
a
man
with
slouching
gait
and
woeful
countenance
,
attired
in
a
cheap
suit
of
shabby
grey
,
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
Granton
Hotel
,
at
Granton
,
and
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
gazed
thoughtfully
out
over
the
broad
waters
of
the
Firth
of
Forth
,
to
where
the
Fifeshire
hills
loomed
dark
upon
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
Slowly
his
keen
eyes
wandered
away
eastward
to
the
open
sea
,
an
extensive
view
of
which
he
obtained
from
the
flight
of
steps
whereon
he
stood
,
and
then
with
a
sigh
of
disappointment
he
buttoned
his
coat
,
and
,
grasping
his
stick
,
descended
,
and
walked
at
a
leisurely
pace
along
the
road
through
Newhaven
to
Leith
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
-
night
.
<EOS>
To
-
night
at
sundown
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
to
himself
,
as
he
bent
his
head
to
the
wind
.
 
<EOS>
Involuntarily
he
placed
his
hand
to
his
hip
to
reassure
himself
that
a
letter
he
carried
was
still
safe
.
 
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
"
I
declare
I
feel
quite
timid
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Everything
is
so
quiet
here
;
the
houses
look
deserted
,
and
everybody
seems
to
have
left
the
place
.
<EOS>
Surely
they
can
have
no
suspicion
,
and
--
and
if
they
had
?
<EOS>
What
does
it
matter?--eh
,
what
?
"
 
<EOS>
Quickening
his
pace
,
he
passed
down
the
long
,
quaint
street
of
Newhaven
,
lined
on
each
side
by
ancient
fishermen
's
cottages
,
and
then
,
crossing
the
railway
,
passed
under
the
wall
of
Leith
Fort
,
whereon
a
couple
of
sentries
were
pacing
.
<EOS>
Glancing
up
at
the
two
artillerymen
,
with
the
half
-
dozen
obsolete
guns
behind
them
,
and
their
background
of
grass
-
grown
mounds
and
buildings
,
the
wayfarer
smiled
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
how
different
would
be
the
scene
at
this
spot
ere
long
.
 
<EOS>
Leith
Fort
was
a
sort
of
fortified
back
-
garden
.
<EOS>
The
railway
ran
close
to
the
sea
,
parallel
with
which
<EOS>
was
the
highway
,
and
upon
higher
ground
at
the
back
was
a
block
of
buildings
,
before
which
a
few
black
old
cannon
were
placed
in
formidable
array
,
and
in
such
a
position
as
to
be
fully
exposed
to
any
destructive
projectiles
fired
from
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
On
went
the
down
-
at
-
heel
wayfarer
,
his
shifty
eyes
ever
on
the
alert
,
viewing
with
suspicion
the
one
or
two
persons
he
met
.
<EOS>
Apparently
he
was
expecting
the
arrival
of
some
craft
,
for
his
gaze
was
constantly
turned
towards
the
wide
expanse
of
grey
water
,
eager
to
detect
the
smallest
speck
upon
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
regarded
him
critically
might
have
noticed
something
remarkable
about
his
appearance
,
yet
not
even
his
most
intimate
friends
would
have
recognised
in
this
broken
-
down
,
half
-
starved
clerk
,
who
had
arrived
at
Granton
that
morning
,
after
tramping
over
from
Glasgow
,
the
popular
man
-
about
-
town
,
the
Count
von
Beilstein
!
 
<EOS>
"
Those
fools
will
soon
be
swept
away
into
eternity
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
,
as
he
glanced
back
in
the
direction
of
the
fort
.
<EOS>
"
They
will
have
an
opportunity
of
tasting
Russian
lead
,
and
of
practising
with
their
guns
,
which
are
only
fit
for
a
museum
.
<EOS>
They
mount
guard
to
defend
an
attack
!
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
They
seek
their
own
destruction
,
for
no
force
can
withstand
that
which
will
presently
appear
to
give
them
a
sudden
rousing
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
elevated
--
blown
into
the
air
,
together
with
their
miserable
guns
,
their
barracks
,
and
the
whole
of
their
antiquated
paraphernalia
.
<EOS>
And
to
me
the
world
owes
this
national
catastrophe
!
<EOS>
I
am
the
looker
-
on
.
<EOS>
These
British
have
a
proverb
that
the
looker
-
on
sees
most
of
the
game
.
<EOS>
_
Bien
!
<EOS>
that
is
full
of
truth
.
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
chuckled
to
himself
,
pursuing
his
way
at
the
same
pace
,
now
and
then
glancing
back
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
no
one
dogged
his
footsteps
.
<EOS>
Darkness
had
crept
on
quickly
as
he
passed
along
through
the
open
country
at
Fillyside
and
entered
Portobello
,
the
little
watering
-
place
so
popular
with
holiday
makers
from
Edinburgh
during
the
summer
.
<EOS>
Along
the
deserted
promenade
he
strolled
leisurely
from
end
to
end
,
and
passing
out
of
the
town
through
Joppa
,
came
at
length
to
that
rugged
shore
between
the
Salt
Pans
and
Eastfield
.
<EOS>
The
tide
was
out
,
so
,
leaving
the
road
,
he
walked
on
in
the
darkness
over
the
shingles
until
he
came
to
a
small
cove
,
and
a
moment
later
two
men
confronted
him
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
sentences
in
Russian
were
rapidly
exchanged
between
the
spy
and
the
men
,
and
then
the
latter
at
once
guided
him
to
where
a
boat
lay
in
readiness
,
but
concealed
.
<EOS>
Five
minutes
later
the
Count
was
being
rowed
swiftly
but
silently
away
into
the
darkness
by
six
stalwart
men
belonging
to
one
of
the
Tsar
's
battleships
.
 
<EOS>
The
oars
dipped
regularly
as
the
boat
glided
onwards
,
but
no
word
was
exchanged
,
until
about
twenty
minutes
later
the
men
suddenly
stopped
pulling
,
a
rope
thrown
by
a
mysterious
but
vigilant
hand
whistled
over
their
heads
and
fell
across
them
,
and
then
they
found
themselves
under
the
dark
side
of
a
huge
ironclad
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
new
battleship
,
_
Admiral
Orlovski
_
,
which
had
only
just
left
the
Baltic
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Without
delay
the
spy
climbed
on
board
,
and
was
conducted
at
once
by
a
young
officer
into
the
Admiral
's
private
cabin
.
 
<EOS>
A
bearded
,
middle
-
aged
man
,
in
handsome
naval
uniform
,
who
was
poring
over
a
chart
,
rose
as
he
entered
.
<EOS>
The
spy
,
bowing
,
said
briefly
in
Russian--
 
<EOS>
"
I
desire
to
see
Prince
Feodor
Mazaroff
,
Admiral
of
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
at
your
service
,
m'sieur
,
"
the
other
replied
in
French
,
motioning
him
to
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
Count
,
seating
himself
,
tossed
his
hat
carelessly
upon
the
table
,
explaining
that
he
had
been
sent
by
the
Russian
Intelligence
Department
as
bearer
of
certain
important
documents
which
would
materially
assist
him
in
his
operations
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
observed
the
Prince
,
"
I
received
a
telegram
from
the
Ministry
at
Petersburg
before
I
left
Christiansand
,
telling
me
to
await
you
here
,
and
that
you
would
furnish
various
information
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
That
I
am
ready
to
do
as
far
as
lies
in
my
power
,
"
replied
the
Count
,
taking
from
his
hip
pocket
a
bulky
packet
,
sealed
with
three
great
daubs
of
black
wax
.
<EOS>
This
he
handed
to
the
Prince
,
saying
,
"
It
contains
maps
of
the
country
between
Edinburgh
and
Glasgow
,
specially
prepared
by
our
Secret
Service
,
together
with
a
marked
chart
of
the
Firth
of
Forth
,
and
full
detailed
information
regarding
the
troops
remaining
to
defend
this
district
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Admiral
broke
the
seals
,
and
glanced
eagerly
through
the
contents
,
with
evident
satisfaction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Now
,
what
is
the
general
condition
of
the
south
of
Scotland
?
<EOS>
"
the
Prince
asked
,
lounging
back
,
twirling
his
moustache
with
a
self
-
satisfied
air
.
 
<EOS>
"
Totally
unprepared
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
believed
that
any
attack
will
be
made
.
<EOS>
The
military
left
north
of
the
Cheviots
after
mobilisation
were
sent
south
to
assist
in
the
defence
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Let
us
hope
our
expedition
to
-
night
will
meet
with
success
.
<EOS>
We
are
now
one
mile
east
of
Craig
Waugh
,
and
in
an
hour
our
big
guns
will
arouse
Leith
from
its
lethargy
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
watch
the
fun
from
deck
,
and
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
knowledge
of
the
district
.
<EOS>
Is
the
fort
at
Leith
likely
to
offer
any
formidable
resistance
?
"
continued
the
Admiral
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
the
information
here
is
somewhat
vague
upon
that
point
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
The
place
is
useless
,
"
replied
the
spy
,
as
he
stretched
out
his
hand
and
took
a
pencil
and
paper
from
the
Prince
's
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
"
See
!
<EOS>
I
will
sketch
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
In
the
character
of
a
starving
workman
who
desired
to
volunteer
I
called
there
,
and
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
good
view
of
the
interior
.
<EOS>
They
have
a
few
modern
guns
,
but
the
remainder
are
old
muzzleloaders
,
which
against
such
guns
as
you
have
on
board
here
will
be
worse
than
useless
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
he
rapidly
sketched
a
plan
of
the
defences
in
a
neat
and
accurate
manner
,
acquired
by
long
practice
.
<EOS>
"
The
most
serious
resistance
will
,
however
,
be
offered
from
Inchkeith
Island
,
four
miles
off
Leith
.
<EOS>
There
has
lately
been
established
there
a
new
fort
,
containing
guns
of
the
latest
type
.
<EOS>
A
plan
of
the
place
,
which
I
succeeded
in
obtaining
a
few
days
ago
,
is
,
you
will
find
,
pinned
to
the
chart
of
the
Firth
of
Forth
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Admiral
opened
out
the
document
indicated
,
and
closely
examined
the
little
sketch
plan
appended
.
<EOS>
On
the
chart
were
a
number
of
small
squares
marked
in
scarlet
,
surrounded
by
a
blue
circle
to
distinguish
them
more
readily
from
the
dots
of
red
which
pointed
out
the
position
of
the
lights
.
<EOS>
These
squares
,
prepared
with
the
utmost
care
by
von
Beilstein
,
showed
the
position
of
certain
submarine
mines
,
a
plan
of
which
he
had
succeeded
in
obtaining
by
one
of
his
marvellous
master
-
strokes
of
finesse
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thanks
to
you
,
Count
,
our
preparations
are
now
complete
,
"
observed
the
Prince
,
offering
the
spy
a
cigarette
from
his
silver
case
,
and
taking
one
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Our
transports
,
with
three
army
corps
,
numbering
nearly
60,000
men
and
200
guns
,
are
at
the
present
moment
lying
12
miles
north
of
the
Bass
Rock
,
awaiting
orders
to
enter
the
Firth
,
therefore
I
think
when
we
land
we
<EOS>
shall"--
 
<EOS>
A
ray
of
brilliant
white
light
streamed
for
a
moment
through
the
port
of
the
cabin
,
and
then
disappeared
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
,
jumping
to
his
feet
,
looked
out
into
the
darkness
,
and
saw
the
long
beam
sweeping
slowly
round
over
the
water
,
lighting
up
the
ships
of
his
squadron
in
rapid
succession
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
search
-
lights
of
Inchkeith
!
<EOS>
"
he
gasped
,
with
an
imprecation
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
idea
we
were
within
their
range
,
but
now
they
have
discovered
us
there
's
no
time
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
I
must
leave
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
,
of
course
,
remain
on
board
,
and
land
with
us
"
;
and
a
moment
later
he
rushed
on
deck
,
and
shouted
an
order
which
was
promptly
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
was
a
low
booming
,
and
in
another
second
a
column
of
dark
water
rose
as
the
first
shot
ricochetted
about
five
hundred
yards
from
their
bows
.
<EOS>
Orders
shouted
in
Russian
echoed
through
the
ship
,
numbers
of
signals
were
exchanged
rapidly
with
the
other
vessels
,
and
the
sea
suddenly
became
alive
with
torpedo
boats
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
British
guns
sounded
like
distant
thunder
,
and
shots
fell
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Russian
ships
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
soon
as
the
men
were
at
their
quarters
,
electric
signals
rang
from
the
conning
-
tower
of
the
_
Admiral
Orlovski
_
,
and
one
of
her
56-tonners
crashed
and
roared
from
her
turret
,
and
a
shot
sped
away
towards
where
the
light
showed
.
<EOS>
The
noise
immediately
became
deafening
as
the
guns
from
nine
other
ships
thundered
almost
simultaneously
,
sending
a
perfect
hail
of
shell
upon
the
island
fort
.
<EOS>
In
the
darkness
the
scene
was
one
of
most
intense
excitement
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
the
spy
found
himself
amidst
the
din
of
battle
,
and
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
his
nerves
were
somewhat
shaken
as
he
stood
in
a
convenient
corner
watching
the
working
of
one
of
the
great
guns
in
the
turret
,
which
regularly
ran
out
and
added
its
voice
to
the
incessant
thunder
.
    
<EOS>
CHAPTER
XXIX
.
 
<EOS>
LANDING
OF
THE
ENEMY
AT
LEITH
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
vessels
were
now
under
steam
and
approaching
Inchkeith
,
when
suddenly
two
shells
struck
the
_
Admiral
Orlovski
_
amidships
,
carrying
away
a
portion
of
her
superstructure
.
 
<EOS>
Several
of
the
other
vessels
were
also
hit
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
and
shortly
afterwards
a
torpedo
boat
under
the
stern
of
the
flagship
was
struck
by
a
shell
,
and
sank
with
all
hands
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
Russian
vessels
poured
out
their
storm
of
shell
upon
the
fort
,
now
only
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distant
;
but
the
British
fire
still
continued
as
vigorous
and
more
effective
than
at
first
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
flagship
was
struck
,
this
time
on
the
port
quarter
,
but
the
shot
glanced
off
her
armour
into
the
sea
;
while
a
moment
later
another
shell
struck
one
of
her
fighting
tops
,
and
,
bursting
,
wrecked
two
of
the
machine
guns
,
and
killed
half
a
dozen
unfortunate
fellows
who
had
manned
them
.
<EOS>
The
debris
fell
heavily
upon
the
deck
,
and
the
disaster
,
being
witnessed
by
the
spy
,
caused
him
considerable
anxiety
for
his
own
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Even
as
he
looked
he
suddenly
noticed
a
brilliant
flash
from
one
of
the
cruisers
lying
a
little
distance
away
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
terrific
report
,
and
amid
flame
and
smoke
wreckage
shot
high
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
An
explosion
had
occurred
in
the
magazine
,
and
it
was
apparent
the
ship
was
doomed
!
<EOS>
Other
disasters
to
the
Russians
followed
in
quick
succession
.
<EOS>
A
cruiser
which
was
lying
near
the
Herwit
light
-
buoy
blazing
away
upon
the
fort
,
suddenly
rolled
heavily
and
gradually
heeled
over
,
the
water
around
her
being
thrown
into
the
air
by
an
explosion
beneath
the
surface
.
<EOS>
A
contact
mine
had
been
fired
,
and
the
bottom
of
the
ship
had
been
practically
blown
out
,
for
<EOS>
a
few
minutes
later
she
went
down
with
nearly
every
soul
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
moment
this
disaster
occurred
,
the
_
Admiral
Orlovski
_
,
still
discharging
her
heavy
guns
,
was
about
half
-
way
between
the
Briggs
and
the
Pallas
Rock
,
when
a
search
-
light
illuminated
her
from
the
land
,
and
a
heavy
fire
was
suddenly
opened
upon
her
from
Leith
Fort
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
at
once
replied
to
,
and
while
five
of
the
vessels
kept
up
their
fire
upon
Inchkeith
,
the
three
others
turned
their
attention
towards
Leith
,
and
commenced
to
bombard
it
with
common
shell
.
 
<EOS>
How
effectual
were
their
efforts
the
spy
could
at
once
see
,
for
in
the
course
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
notwithstanding
the
defence
offered
by
Leith
Fort
and
several
batteries
on
Arthur
's
Seat
,
at
Granton
Point
,
Wardie
Bush
,
and
at
Seaside
Meadows
,
near
Portobello
,
fires
were
breaking
out
in
various
quarters
of
the
town
,
and
factories
and
buildings
were
now
burning
with
increasing
fury
.
<EOS>
The
great
paraffin
refinery
had
been
set
on
fire
,
and
the
flames
,
leaping
high
into
the
air
,
shed
a
lurid
glare
far
away
over
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
Shells
,
striking
the
Corn
Exchange
,
wrecked
it
,
and
one
,
flying
away
over
the
fort
,
burst
in
the
Leith
Distillery
,
with
the
result
that
the
place
was
set
on
fire
,
and
soon
burned
with
almost
equal
fierceness
with
the
paraffin
works
.
<EOS>
The
shipping
in
the
Edinburgh
,
Albert
,
and
Victoria
Docks
was
ablaze
,
and
the
drill
vessel
H.M.S.
_
Durham
_
had
been
shattered
and
was
burning
.
<EOS>
A
great
row
of
houses
in
Lindsay
Road
had
fallen
prey
to
the
flames
,
while
among
the
other
large
buildings
on
fire
were
the
Baltic
Hotel
,
the
great
goods
station
of
the
North
British
Railway
,
and
the
National
Bank
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
In
addition
to
being
attacked
from
the
forts
on
the
island
,
and
on
land
,
the
Russians
were
now
being
vigorously
fired
upon
by
the
British
Coastguard
ship
_
Imperieuse
_
,
which
,
with
the
cruiser
_
Active
_
,
and
the
gunboat
cruisers
_
Cockchafer
_
,
_
Firm
_
,
and
_
Watchful
_
,
had
now
come
within
range
.
<EOS>
Soon
,
however
,
the
enemy
were
reinforced
by
several
powerful
vessels
,
and
in
the
fierce
battle
that
ensued
the
British
ships
were
driven
off
.
<EOS>
Then
by
reason
of
the
reinforcements
which
the
Russians
brought
up
,
and
the
great
number
of
transports
which
were
now
arriving
,
the
defence
,
desperate
though
it
had
been
,
alas
!
<EOS>
broke
down
,
and
before
midnight
the
invader
set
his
foot
upon
Scottish
soil
.

POSITIONS
FOR

<EOS>
Ere
the
sun
rose
,
a
huge
force
of
60,000
men
had
commenced
a
march
upon
Edinburgh
and
Glasgow
!
 
<EOS>
Events
on
shore
during
that
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
night
were
well
described
by
Captain
Tiller
of
the
Royal
Artillery
,
stationed
at
Leith
Fort
,
who
,
in
a
letter
written
to
his
young
wife
at
Carlisle
,
on
the
following
day
,
gave
the
following
narrative:--
 
<EOS>
"
Disaster
has
fallen
upon
us
.
<EOS>
The
Russians
have
landed
in
Scotland
,
and
the
remnant
of
our
force
which
was
at
Leith
has
fallen
back
inland
.
<EOS>
On
Friday
,
just
after
nightfall
,
we
were
first
apprised
of
our
danger
by
hearing
heavy
firing
from
the
sea
in
the
direction
of
Inchkeith
Fort
,
and
all
civilians
were
sent
on
inland
,
while
we
prepared
for
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
"
Very
soon
a
number
of
ships
were
visible
,
some
of
them
being
evidently
transports
,
and
as
they
were
observed
taking
soundings
,
it
was
clear
that
an
immediate
landing
was
intended
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
it
was
a
light
night
,
and
while
two
Volunteer
field
batteries
were
sent
out
along
the
coast
west
to
Cramond
and
east
to
Fisherrow
,
we
completed
our
arrangements
in
the
fort
.
<EOS>
With
such
antiquated
weapons
as
were
at
our
disposal
defeat
was
a
foregone
conclusion
,
and
we
knew
that
to
annoy
the
enemy
and
delay
their
landing
would
be
the
extent
of
our
resistance
.
<EOS>
Some
of
our
guns
were
,
of
course
,
of
comparatively
recent
date
,
and
our
supply
of
ammunition
was
fair
,
but
the
Volunteer
guns
were
antiquated
40-pounder
muzzleloaders
,
which
ought
to
have
been
withdrawn
years
ago
,
and
the
gunners
had
had
very
little
field
training
.
<EOS>
The
arrangements
for
horsing
the
guns
were
also
very
inefficient
,
and
they
had
no
waggons
or
transport
.
<EOS>
Most
of
our
forces
having
been
drawn
south
,
the
only
infantry
available
was
a
battalion
and
a
half
--
really
a
provisional
battalion
,
for
it
was
composed
of
portions
of
two
Volunteer
rifle
regiments
,
with
a
detachment
of
Regulars
.
<EOS>
Our
Regular
artillery
detachment
was
,
unfortunately
,
very
inadequate
,
for
<EOS>
although
the
armament
of
the
fort
had
been
recently
strengthened
,
the
force
had
been
weakened
just
before
the
outbreak
of
war
by
the
despatch
of
an
Indian
draft
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
apparent
that
the
enemy
would
not
attempt
to
destroy
our
position
,
but
land
and
carry
it
by
assault
;
therefore
,
while
the
Inchkeith
guns
kept
them
at
bay
,
we
undermined
our
fort
,
opened
our
magazines
,
and
got
ready
for
a
little
target
practice
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Volunteer
batteries
sent
eastward
had
been
ordered
to
do
what
execution
they
could
,
and
then
,
in
the
case
of
a
reverse
,
to
retire
through
Portobello
and
Duddingston
to
Edinburgh
,
and
those
on
the
west
were
to
go
inland
to
Ratho
;
while
we
were
resolved
to
hold
the
fort
as
long
as
possible
,
and
if
at
last
we
were
compelled
to
retire
we
intended
to
blow
up
the
place
before
leaving
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
we
found
the
Russian
flagship
within
range
,
we
opened
fire
upon
her
,
and
this
action
caused
a
perfect
storm
of
projectiles
to
be
directed
upon
us
.
<EOS>
The
town
was
soon
in
flames
,
the
shipping
in
the
harbour
sank
,
and
the
martello
tower
was
blown
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Our
search
-
light
was
very
soon
brought
into
requisition
,
and
by
its
aid
some
of
the
boats
of
the
enemy
's
transports
were
sunk
,
while
others
came
to
grief
on
the
Black
Rocks
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
the
enemy
had
turned
their
search
-
lights
in
every
direction
where
they
could
see
firing
,
and
very
soon
our
Volunteer
batteries
were
silenced
,
and
then
Granton
harbour
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
's
landing
parties
.
<EOS>
Having
first
rendered
their
guns
useless
,
the
survivors
fell
back
to
Corstorphine
Hill
,
outside
Edinburgh
,
and
we
soon
afterwards
received
intelligence
that
the
Russians
were
landing
at
Granton
in
thousands
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
although
our
garrison
was
so
weak
and
inexperienced
,
we
nevertheless
kept
up
a
vigorous
fire
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
saw
how
Inchkeith
Fort
had
been
silenced
,
and
how
our
Volunteer
batteries
had
been
destroyed
,
and
knew
that
sooner
or
later
we
must
share
the
same
fate
,
and
abandon
our
position
.
<EOS>
As
boatload
after
boatload
of
Russians
attempted
to
land
,
we
either
sank
them
by
shots
from
our
guns
or
swept
them
with
a
salvo
of
bullets
from
our
Maxims
;
yet
as
soon
as
we
had
hurled
back
one
landing
party
others
took
its
place
.
 
<EOS>
"
Many
were
the
heroic
deeds
our
gunners
performed
that
night
,
as
hand
to
hand
they
fought
,
and
annihilated
the
Russians
who
succeeded
in
landing
;
but
in
this
frightful
struggle
we
lost
heavily
,
and
at
length
,
when
all
hope
of
an
effective
defence
had
been
abandoned
,
we
placed
electric
wires
in
the
magazine
,
and
the
order
was
given
to
retire
.
<EOS>
This
we
did
,
leaving
our
search
-
light
in
position
in
order
to
deceive
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
Half
our
number
had
been
killed
,
and
we
sped
across
to
Bonnington
,
running
out
a
wire
along
the
ground
as
we
went
.
<EOS>
The
Russians
,
now
landing
rapidly
in
great
force
,
swarmed
into
the
fort
and
captured
the
guns
and
ammunition
,
while
a
party
of
infantry
pursued
us
.
<EOS>
But
we
kept
them
back
for
fully
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
until
we
knew
that
the
fort
would
be
well
garrisoned
by
the
invaders
;
then
we
sent
a
current
through
the
wire
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
explosion
that
ensued
was
deafening
,
and
its
effect
appalling
.
<EOS>
Never
have
I
witnessed
a
more
awful
sight
.
<EOS>
Hundreds
of
tons
of
all
sorts
of
explosives
and
ammunition
were
fired
simultaneously
by
the
electric
spark
,
and
the
whole
fort
,
with
nearly
six
hundred
of
the
enemy
,
who
were
busy
establishing
their
headquarters
,
were
in
an
instant
blown
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
For
several
moments
the
space
around
us
where
we
stood
seemed
filled
with
flying
debris
,
and
the
mangled
remains
of
those
who
a
second
before
had
been
elated
beyond
measure
by
their
success
.
 
<EOS>
"
Those
were
terribly
exciting
moments
,
and
for
a
few
seconds
there
was
a
cessation
of
the
firing
.
<EOS>
Quickly
,
however
,
the
bombardment
was
resumed
,
and
although
we
totally
annihilated
the
force
pursuing
us
,
we
fell
back
to
Restalrig
,
and
at
length
gained
the
battery
that
had
been
established
on
Arthur
's
Seat
,
and
which
was
now
keeping
up
a
heavy
fire
upon
the
Russian
transports
lying
out
in
the
Narrow
Deep
.
<EOS>
Subsequently
we
went
on
to
Dalkeith
.
<EOS>
Our
situation
is
most
critical
in
every
respect
,
but
we
are
expecting
reinforcements
,
and
a
terrible
battle
is
imminent
.

Thus
the
Russians
landed
three
corps
of
20,000
each
where
they
were
least
expected
,
and
at
once
prepared
to
invest
Edinburgh
and
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
boats
which
came
ashore
at
Leith
that
night
,
after
the
blowing
up
of
the
fort
,
brought
several
large
mysterious
-
looking
black
boxes
,
which
were
handled
with
infinite
care
by
the
specially
selected
detachment
of
men
who
had
been
told
off
to
take
charge
of
them
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
locks
were
the
official
seals
of
the
Russian
War
Office
;
and
even
the
men
themselves
,
unaware
of
their
contents
,
looked
upon
them
with
a
certain
amount
of
suspicion
,
handling
them
very
gingerly
,
and
placing
them
in
waggons
which
they
seized
from
a
builder
's
yard
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
alone
knew
the
character
of
these
mysterious
consignments
,
and
as
they
superintended
the
landing
,
whispered
together
excitedly
.
<EOS>
The
news
of
the
invasion
,
already
telegraphed
throughout
Scotland
from
end
to
end
,
caused
the
utmost
alarm
;
but
had
the
people
known
what
those
black
boxes
,
the
secret
of
which
was
so
carefully
guarded
,
contained
,
they
would
have
been
dismayed
and
appalled
.
 
<EOS>
Truth
to
tell
,
the
Russians
were
about
to
try
a
method
of
wholesale
and
awful
destruction
,
which
,
although
vaguely
suggested
in
time
of
peace
,
had
never
yet
been
tested
in
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
If
successful
,
they
knew
it
would
cause
death
and
desolation
over
an
inconceivably
wide
area
,
and
prove
at
once
a
most
extraordinary
and
startling
development
of
modern
warfare
.
<EOS>
The
faces
of
a
whole
army
,
however
brave
,
would
blanch
before
its
terrific
power
,
and
war
in
every
branch
,
on
land
and
on
sea
,
would
become
revolutionised
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
boxes
remained
locked
and
guarded
.
<EOS>
The
secret
was
to
be
kept
until
the
morrow
,
when
the
first
trial
was
ordered
to
be
made
,
and
the
officers
in
charge
expressed
an
opinion
between
themselves
that
a
blow
would
then
be
struck
that
would
at
once
startle
and
terrify
the
whole
world

CHAPTER
XXX
.
 
<EOS>
ATTACK
ON
EDINBURGH
.
  
<EOS>
In
attacking
Edinburgh
the
besiegers
at
once
discovered
they
had
a
much
more
difficult
task
than
they
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
The
Russian
onslaught
had
been
carefully
planned
.
<EOS>
Landing
just
before
dawn
,
the
1st
Corps
,
consisting
of
about
twenty
thousand
men
,
marched
direct
to
Glasgow
by
way
of
South
Queensferry
and
Kirkliston
,
and
through
Linlithgow
,
sacking
and
burning
all
three
towns
in
the
advance
.
 
<EOS>
The
3rd
Army
Corps
succeeded
,
after
some
very
sharp
skirmishing
,
in
occupying
the
Pentland
Hills
,
in
order
to
protect
the
flanks
of
the
first
force
,
while
a
strong
detachment
was
left
behind
to
guard
the
base
at
Leith
.
<EOS>
The
2nd
Corps
meanwhile
marched
direct
upon
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
The
defenders
,
consisting
of
Militia
,
Infantry
,
Artillery
,
the
local
Volunteers
left
behind
during
the
mobilisation
,
and
a
large
number
of
civilians
from
the
neighbouring
towns
,
who
had
hastily
armed
on
hearing
the
alarming
news
,
were
quickly
massed
in
three
divisions
on
the
Lammermuir
Hills
,
along
the
hills
near
Peebles
,
and
on
Tinto
Hill
,
near
Lanark
.
 
<EOS>
The
Russian
army
corps
which
marched
from
Leith
upon
Edinburgh
about
seven
o'clock
on
the
following
morning
met
with
a
most
desperate
resistance
.
<EOS>
On
Arthur
's
Seat
a
strong
battery
had
been
established
by
the
City
of
Edinburgh
Artillery
,
under
Col
.
J.
F.
Mackay
,
and
the
1st
Berwickshire
,
under
Col
.
A.
Johnston
;
and
on
the
higher
parts
of
the
Queen
's
Drive
,
overlooking
the
crooked
little
village
of
Duddingston
,
guns
of
the
1st
Forfarshire
,
under
Col
.
Stewart
-
Sandeman
,
V.D.
,
flashed
and
shed
forth
torrents
of
bullets
and
shell
,
which
played
havoc
with
the
enemy
's
infantry
coming
up
the
Portobello
and
Musselburgh
roads
.
<EOS>
Batteries
on
the
Braid
and
Blackford
Hills
commanded
the
southern
portion
of
the
city
;
while
to
the
west
,
the
battery
on
Corstorphine
Hill
prevented
the
enemy
from
pushing
along
up
the
high
road
from
Granton
.
 
<EOS>
Between
Jock
's
Lodge
and
Duddingston
Mills
the
Russians
,
finding
cover
,
commenced
a
sharp
attack
about
nine
o'clock
;
but
discovering
,
after
an
hour
's
hard
fighting
,
that
to
attempt
to
carry
the
defenders
'
position
was
futile
,
they
made
a
sudden
retreat
towards
Niddry
House
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
commander
,
observing
this
,
and
suspecting
their
intention
to
make
a
circuit
and
enter
the
city
by
way
of
Newington
,
immediately
set
his
field
telegraph
to
work
,
and
sent
news
on
to
the
infantry
brigade
at
Blackford
.
 
<EOS>
This
consisted
mainly
of
the
Queen
's
Volunteer
Rifle
Brigade
(
Royal
Scots
)
,
under
Col
.
T.
W.
Jones
,
V.D.
;
the
4th
,
5th
,
6th
,
7th
,
and
8th
Volunteer
Battalions
of
the
Royal
Scots
,
under
Col

W.
U.

,
V.D.
,
Col

<EOS>
Sir
G.
D.
Clerk
,
Col
.
P.
Dods
,
and
Col
.
G.
F.
Melville
<EOS>
respectively
,
with
a
company
of
engineers
.
<EOS>
The
intelligence
they
received
placed
them
on
the
alert
,
and
ere
long
the
enemy
extended
his
flank
in
an
endeavour
to
enter
Newington
.
<EOS>
The
bridges
already
prepared
for
demolition
by
the
defenders
were
now
promptly
blown
up
,
and
in
the
sharp
fight
that
ensued
the
enemy
were
repulsed
with
heavy
loss
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
formidable
division
of
the
3rd
Russian
Army
Corps
guarding
the
base
at
Leith
had
attacked
the
Corstorphine
position
,
finding
their
headquarters
untenable
under
its
fire
,
and
although
losing
several
guns
and
a
large
number
of
men
,
they
succeeded
,
after
about
an
hour
's
hard
fighting
,
in
storming
the
hill
and
sweeping
away
the
small
but
gallant
band
of
defenders
.
 
<EOS>
The
fight
was
long
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
struggle
to
the
death
.
<EOS>
Over
the
whole
historic
battle
-
ground
from
the
Tweed
to
the
Forth
,
fighting
spread
,
and
everywhere
the
loss
of
life
was
terrible
.
 
<EOS>
The
long
autumn
day
passed
slowly
,
yet
hostilities
continued
as
vigorous
and
sanguinary
as
they
had
begun
.
<EOS>
Before
the
sun
sank
many
a
brave
Briton
lay
dead
or
dying
,
but
many
more
Muscovites
had
been
sent
to
that
bourne
whence
none
return
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
the
British
line
of
communications
was
broken
between
Temple
and
Eddleston
,
the
outposts
at
the
latter
place
having
been
surprised
and
slaughtered
.
<EOS>
But
although
the
enemy
strove
hard
to
break
down
the
lines
of
defence
and
invest
Edinburgh
,
yet
time
after
time
they
were
hurled
back
with
fearful
loss
.
<EOS>
Colinton
and
Liberton
were
sacked
and
burned
by
the
Tsar
's
forces
.
<EOS>
On
every
hand
the
Russians
spread
death
and
destruction
;
still
the
defenders
held
their
own
,
and
when
the
fighting
ceased
after
nightfall
Edinburgh
was
still
safe
.
<EOS>
Strong
barricades
manned
by
civilians
had
been
hastily
thrown
up
near
the
station
in
Leith
Walk
,
in
London
Road
opposite
the
Abbey
Church
,
in
Inverleith
Row
,
in
Clerk
Street
and
Montague
Street
,
while
all
the
bridges
over
the
Water
of
Leith
had
been
blown
up
with
gun
-
cotton
;
quick
-
firing
guns
had
been
posted
on
Calton
Hill
and
at
the
Castle
,
while
in
St.
Andrew
's
Square
a
battery
had
been
established
by
the
1st
Haddington
Volunteer
Artillery
,
under
Major
J.
J.
Kelly
,
who
had
arrived
in
haste
from
Dunbar
,
and
this
excellent
position
commanded
a
wide
stretch
of
country
away
towards
Granton
.
 
<EOS>
At
dead
of
night
,
under
the
calm
,
bright
stars
,
a
strange
scene
might
have
been
witnessed
.
<EOS>
In
the
deep
shadow
cast
by
the
wall
of
an
old
and
tumble
-
down
barn
near
the
cross
-
roads
at
Niddry
,
about
three
miles
from
Edinburgh
,
two
Russian
infantry
officers
were
in
earnest
conversation
.
<EOS>
They
stood
leaning
upon
a
broken
fence
,
talking
in
a
half
-
whisper
in
French
,
so
that
the
half
-
dozen
privates
might
not
understand
what
they
said
.
<EOS>
The
six
men
were
busy
unpacking
several
strange
black
cases
,
handling
the
contents
with
infinite
care
.
<EOS>
Apparently
three
of
the
boxes
contained
a
quantity
of
fine
silk
,
carefully
folded
,
while
another
contained
a
number
of
square
,
dark
-
looking
packages
,
which
,
when
taken
out
,
were
packed
in
order
upon
a
strong
net
which
was
first
spread
upon
the
grass
.
<EOS>
Ropes
were
strewn
over
the
ground
in
various
directions
,
the
silk
was
unfolded
,
and
presently
,
when
all
the
contents
had
been
minutely
inspected
by
the
two
officers
with
lanterns
,
a
small
tube
was
taken
from
a
box
that
had
remained
undisturbed
,
and
fastened
into
an
object
shaped
like
a
bellows
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
all
preparations
were
satisfactorily
completed
,
the
six
men
threw
themselves
upon
the
grass
to
snatch
an
hour
's
repose
,
while
the
officers
returned
to
their
previous
positions
,
leaning
against
the
broken
fence
,
and
gravely
discussing
their
proposals
for
the
morrow
's
gigantic
sensation
.
<EOS>
The
elder
of
the
two
was
explaining
to
his
companion
the
nature
of
the
_
coup
_
which
they
intended
to
deliver
,
and
the
mode
in
which
it
would
be
made
.
<EOS>
So
engrossed
were
they
in
the
contemplation
of
the
appalling
results
that
would
accrue
<EOS>
,
they
did
not
observe
that
they
were
standing
beneath
a
small
square
hole
in
the
wall
of
the
barn
;
neither
did
they
notice
that
from
this
aperture
a
dark
head
protruded
for
a
second
and
then
quick
as
lightning
withdrew
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
like
a
shadow
,
and
disappeared
instantly
!
 
<EOS>
Ten
minutes
later
a
mysterious
figure
was
creeping
cautiously
along
under
the
hedge
of
the
high
road
to
Newington
in
the
direction
of
the
British
lines
.
<EOS>
Crawling
along
the
grass
,
and
pausing
now
and
then
with
his
ear
to
the
ground
,
listening
,
he
advanced
by
short
,
silent
stages
,
exercising
the
greatest
caution
,
<EOS>
well
aware
that
death
would
be
his
fate
<EOS>
should
he
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
In
wading
the
Braid
Burn
he
almost
betrayed
himself
to
a
Russian
sentry
;
but
at
last
,
after
travelling
for
over
an
hour
,
risking
discovery
at
any
moment
,
he
at
length
passed
the
British
outposts
beyond
Liberton
,
and
ascended
the
Braid
Hills
to
the
headquarters
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
he
told
the
General
commanding
was
at
first
looked
upon
as
ludicrous
.
<EOS>
In
the
dim
candlelight
in
the
General
's
tent
he
certainly
looked
a
disreputable
derelict
,
his
old
and
tattered
clothes
wet
through
,
his
hands
cut
by
stones
and
bleeding
,
and
his
face
half
covered
with
mud
.
<EOS>
The
three
officers
who
were
with
the
General
laughed
when
he
dashed
in
excitedly
,
and
related
the
conversation
he
had
overheard
;
yet
when
he
subsequently
went
on
to
describe
in
detail
what
he
had
witnessed
,
and
when
they
remembered
that
this
tramp
was
an
artilleryman
who
had
long
ago
been
conspicuous
by
his
bravery
at
El
Teb
,
and
an
ingenious
inventor
,
their
expression
of
amusement
gave
way
to
one
of
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
The
General
,
who
had
been
writing
,
thoughtfully
tapped
the
little
camp
table
before
him
with
his
pen
.
"
<EOS>
So
they
intend
to
destroy
us
and
wreck
the
city
by
that
means
,
now
that
their
legitimate
tactics
have
failed
!
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
credit
that
such
is
their
intention
;
yet
if
they
should
be
successful
--
<EOS>
if"--
 
<EOS>
"
But
they
will
not
be
successful
,
sir
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
send
some
one
to
assist
me
,
and
allow
me
to
act
as
I
think
fit
,
I
will
frustrate
their
dastardly
design
,
and
the
city
shall
be
saved
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
at
liberty
to
act
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
You
know
their
plans
,
and
I
have
perfect
confidence
in
you
,
Mackenzie
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
,
however
,
mention
a
word
of
the
enemy
's
intention
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
It
would
terrify
the
men
;
and
although
I
do
not
doubt
their
bravery
,
yet
the
knowledge
of
such
a
horrible
fate
hanging
over
them
must
necessarily
increase
their
anxiety
,
and
thus
prevent
them
from
doing
their
best
.
<EOS>
We
are
weak
,
but
remember
we
are
all
Britons
.
<EOS>
Now
come
,
"
he
added
,
"
sit
there
,
upon
that
box
,
and
explain
at
once
what
is
your
scheme
of
defence
against
this
extraordinary
attack
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
the
fearless
man
to
whom
the
General
had
entrusted
the
defence
of
Edinburgh
obeyed
,
and
commenced
to
explain
what
means
he
intended
to
take
--
a
desperate
but
well
-
devised
plan
,
which
drew
forth
words
of
the
highest
commendation
from
the
commanding
officer
and
those
with
him
.
<EOS>
They
knew
that
the
fate
of
Edinburgh
hung
in
the
balance
,
and
that
if
the
city
were
taken
it
would
be
the
first
step
towards
their
downfall
.

CHAPTER
XXXI
.
 
<EOS>
"
THE
DEMON
OF
WAR
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Two
hours
later
,
just
before
the
break
of
day
,
British
bugles
sounded
,
and
the
camp
on
the
Braid
Hills
was
immediately
astir
.
<EOS>
That
the
enemy
were
about
to
test
the
efficiency
of
a
new
gigantic
engine
of
war
was
unknown
except
to
the
officers
and
the
brave
man
who
had
risked
his
life
in
order
to
obtain
the
secret
of
the
foeman
's
plans
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
the
British
General
was
trusting
,
and
as
with
knit
brows
and
anxious
face
<EOS>
the
grey
-
haired
officer
stood
at
the
door
of
his
tent
gazing
across
the
burn
to
Blackford
Hill
,
he
was
wondering
whether
he
had
yet
obtained
his
coign
of
vantage
.
<EOS>
From
the
case
slung
round
his
shoulder
<EOS>
he
drew
his
field
glasses
and
turned
them
upon
a
clump
of
trees
near
the
top
of
the
hill
,
straining
his
eyes
to
discover
any
movement
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
crest
of
the
hill
two
Volunteer
artillery
batteries
were
actively
preparing
for
the
coming
fray
,
but
as
yet
it
was
too
dark
to
discern
anything
among
the
distant
clump
of
trees
;
so
,
replacing
his
glasses
<EOS>
,
the
commanding
officer
re
-
entered
his
tent
and
bent
for
a
long
time
over
the
Ordnance
Map
under
the
glimmering
,
uncertain
light
of
a
guttering
candle
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
Russians
were
busily
completing
their
arrangements
for
striking
an
appalling
blow
.
 
<EOS>
Concealed
by
a
line
of
trees
and
a
number
of
farm
buildings
,
the
little
section
of
the
enemy
had
worked
indefatigably
for
the
past
two
hours
,
and
now
in
the
grey
dawn
the
contents
of
the
mysterious
boxes
,
a
long
dark
monster
,
lay
upon
the
grass
,
moving
restlessly
,
trying
to
free
itself
from
its
trammels
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
huge
and
curiously
-
shaped
air
-
ship
,
and
was
to
be
used
for
dropping
great
charges
of
melinite
and
steel
bombs
filled
with
picric
acid
into
the
handsome
historic
city
of
Edinburgh
!
<EOS>
Some
of
the
shells
were
filled
with
sulphurous
acid
,
carbon
dioxide
,
and
other
deadly
compounds
,
the
intent
being
to
cause
suffocation
over
wide
areas
by
the
volatilisation
of
liquid
gases
!
 
<EOS>
This
controllable
electric
balloon
,
a
perfection
of
M.
Gaston
Tissandier
's
invention
a
few
years
before
,
was
,
as
it
lay
upon
the
grass
,
nearly
inflated
and
ready
to
ascend
,
elongated
in
form
,
and
filled
with
hydrogen
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
140
feet
long
,
63
feet
in
diameter
through
the
middle
,
and
the
envelope
was
of
fine
cloth
coated
with
an
impermeable
varnish
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
were
horizontal
shafts
of
flexible
walnut
laths
,
fastened
with
silk
belts
along
the
centre
,
and
over
the
balloon
a
netting
of
ribbons
was
placed
,
and
to
this
the
car
was
connected
.
<EOS>
On
each
of
the
four
sides
was
a
screw
propeller
12
feet
in
diameter
,
driven
by
bichromate
of
potassium
batteries
and
a
dynamo
-
electric
motor
.
<EOS>
The
propellers
were
so
arranged
that
the
balloon
could
keep
head
to
a
hurricane
,
and
when
proceeding
with
the
wind
would
deviate
immediately
from
its
course
by
the
mere
pulling
of
a
lever
by
the
aeronaut
.
 
<EOS>
Carefully
packed
in
the
car
were
large
numbers
of
the
most
powerful
infernal
machines
,
ingeniously
designed
to
effect
the
most
awful
destruction
if
hurled
into
a
thickly
-
populated
centre
.
<EOS>
Piled
in
the
smallest
possible
compass
were
square
steel
boxes
,
some
filled
with
melinite
,
dynamite
,
and
an
explosive
strongly
resembling
cordite
,
only
possessing
twice
its
strength
,
each
with
fulminating
compounds
,
while
others
contained
picric
acid
fitted
with
glass
detonating
tubes
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
this
gigantic
engine
,
which
might
totally
wreck
a
city
and
kill
every
inhabitant
in
half
an
hour
<EOS>
while
at
an
altitude
of
61/2
miles
,
had
rightly
been
named
by
the
Pole
who
had
perfected
Tissandier
's
invention--"The
Demon
of
War
.
<EOS>
"
 
While
the
two
officers
of
the
Russian
balloon
section
,
both
experienced
aeronauts
,
were
finally
examining
minutely
every
rope
,
ascertaining
that
all
was
ready
for
the
ascent
,
away
on
Blackford
Hill
one
man
,
pale
and
determined
,
with
coat
and
vest
thrown
aside
,
was
preparing
a
counterblast
to
the
forthcoming
attack
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
the
clump
of
trees
,
but
with
its
muzzle
pointing
towards
Bridgend
,
a
long
,
thin
gun
of
an
altogether
strange
type
had
been
brought
into
position
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
four
times
the
size
of
a
Maxim
,
which
it
resembled
somewhat
in
shape
,
only
the
barrel
was
much
longer
,
the
store
of
ammunition
being
contained
in
a
large
steel
receptacle
at
the
side
,
wherein
also
was
some
marvellously
-
contrived
mechanism
.
<EOS>
The
six
gunners
who
were
assisting
Mackenzie
at
length
completed
their
work
,
and
the
gun
having
been
carefully
examined
by
the
gallant
man
in
charge
and
two
of
the
officers
who
had
been
in
the
tent
with
the
General
during
the
midnight
consultation
,
Mackenzie
,
with
a
glance
in
the
yet
hazy
distance
where
the
enemy
had
bivouaced
,
pulled
over
a
small
lever
,
which
immediately
started
a
dynamo
.
 
<EOS>
"
In
three
minutes
we
shall
be
ready
for
action
,
"
he
said
,
glancing
at
his
watch
;
and
then
,
turning
a
small
wheel
which
raised
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
so
as
to
point
it
at
a
higher
angle
in
the
direction
of
the
sky
,
he
waited
until
the
space
of
time
he
had
mentioned
had
elapsed
.
 
<EOS>
The
officers
stood
aside
conversing
in
an
undertone
.
<EOS>
This
man
Mackenzie
had
invented
this
strange
-
looking
weapon
,
and
only
one
had
been
made
.
<EOS>
It
had
some
months
before
been
submitted
to
the
War
Office
,
but
they
had
declined
to
take
it
up
,
believing
that
a
patent
they
already
possessed
was
superior
to
it
;
yet
Mackenzie
had
nevertheless
thrown
his
whole
soul
into
his
work
,
and
meant
now
to
show
his
superiors
its
penetrative
powers
,
and
put
its
capabilities
to
practical
test
.
<EOS>
Again
he
glanced
at
his
watch
,
and
quickly
pulled
back
another
lever
,
which
caused
the
motor
to
revolve
at
twice
the
speed
,
and
the
gun
to
emit
a
low
hissing
sound
,
like
escaping
steam
.
<EOS>
Then
he
stepped
back
to
the
officers
,
saying--
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
now
prepared
.
<EOS>
It
will
go
up
as
straight
and
quickly
as
a
rocket
,
but
we
must
catch
it
before
it
ascends
two
miles
,
for
the
clouds
hang
low
,
and
we
may
lose
it
more
quickly
than
we
imagine
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
gunners
stood
in
readiness
,
and
the
two
officers
looked
away
over
Craigmillar
towards
the
grey
distant
sea
.
<EOS>
Dawn
was
spreading
now
,
and
the
haze
was
gradually
clearing
.
<EOS>
They
all
knew
the
attempt
would
be
made
ere
long
,
before
it
grew
much
lighter
,
so
they
stood
at
their
posts
in
readiness
,
Mackenzie
with
his
hand
upon
the
lever
which
would
regulate
the
discharge
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
moments
of
breathless
expectancy
.
<EOS>
Minute
after
minute
went
by
,
but
not
a
word
was
spoken
,
for
every
eye
was
turned
upon
the
crest
of
a
certain
ridge
nearly
three
miles
away
,
at
a
point
where
the
country
was
well
wooded
.
 
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
had
thus
elapsed
,
when
Mackenzie
suddenly
shouted
,
"
Look
,
lads
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
There
she
goes
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
Now
,
let
's
teach
'em
what
Scots
can
do
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
there
rose
from
behind
the
ridge
a
great
dark
mass
,
looking
almost
spectral
in
the
thin
morning
mist
.
<EOS>
For
a
moment
it
seemed
to
poise
and
swing
as
if
uncertain
in
its
flight
,
then
quickly
it
shot
straight
up
towards
the
sky
.
 
<EOS>
"
Ready
?
<EOS>
"
shouted
Mackenzie
,
his
momentary
excitement
having
given
place
to
great
coolness
.
<EOS>
The
men
at
their
posts
all
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
Mackenzie
bent
and
waited
for
a
few
seconds
sighting
the
gun
,
while
the
motor
hummed
with
terrific
speed
.
<EOS>
Then
shouting
"
Fire
!
"
<EOS>
he
drew
back
the
lever
.
 
<EOS>
The
gun
discharged
,
but
there
was
no
report
,
only
a
sharp
hiss
as
the
compressed
air
released
commenced
to
send
charge
after
charge
of
dynamite
automatically
away
into
space
in
rapid
succession
!
 
<EOS>
None
dared
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
was
intense
.
<EOS>
They
watched
the
effect
upon
the
Russian
balloon
,
but
to
their
dismay
saw
it
still
rapidly
ascending
and
unharmed
!
 
<EOS>
It
had
altered
its
course
,
and
instead
of
drifting
away
seaward
was
now
travelling
towards
Duddingston
,
and
making
straight
for
Edinburgh
,
passing
above
the
Russian
camp
.
 
<EOS>
"
Missed
!
<EOS>
_
missed
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
Mackenzie
shrieked
,
turning
back
the
lever
and
arresting
the
discharge
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
four
miles
off
now
,
and
we
can
carry
seven
and
three
-
quarters
to
hit
a
fixed
object
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
lads
,
the
fate
of
Auld
Reekie
is
now
in
your
hands
!
<EOS>
Ready
?
"
 
<EOS>
Again
he
bent
and
sighted
the
gun
,
raising
the
muzzle
higher
than
the
balloon
so
as
to
catch
it
on
the
ascent
.
<EOS>
The
motor
hummed
louder
and
louder
,
the
escaping
air
hissed
and
turned
into
liquid
by
the
enormous
pressure
,
then
with
a
glance
at
the
gauge
he
yelled
"
Fire
!
"
and
pulled
back
the
lever
.
 
<EOS>
Dynamite
shells
,
ejected
at
the
rate
of
50
a
minute
,
rushed
from
the
muzzle
,
and
sped
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Demon
of
War
,
with
its
whirling
propellers
,
continued
on
its
swift
,
silent
mission
of
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
"
Missed
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
one
of
the
men
,
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"
See
!
<EOS>
it
's
gone
!
<EOS>
We've
--
<EOS>
good
heavens!--_why
,
we
've
lost
it
--
lost
it

<EOS>
"
 
Mackenzie
,
who
had
been
glancing
that
moment
at
the
gauges
,
gazed
eagerly
up
,
and
staggered
back
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
disappeared
!
"
<EOS>
he
gasped
.
"
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
They
've
outwitted
us
,
the
brutes
,
and
nothing
<EOS>
now
can
save
Edinburgh
from
destruction
!
<EOS>
_
"
 
Officers
and
men
stood
aghast
,
with
blanched
faces
,
scarce
knowing
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
The
destructive
forces
in
that
controllable
balloon
were
more
than
sufficient
to
lay
the
whole
of
Edinburgh
in
ruins
;
and
then
,
no
doubt
,
the
enemy
would
attempt
by
the
same
means
to
destroy
the
British
batteries
on
the
neighbouring
hills
.
<EOS>
Already
,
along
the
valleys
fighting
had
begun
,
for
rapid
firing
could
be
heard
in
the
direction
of
Gilmerton
,
and
now
and
then
the
British
guns
on
the
Braid
Hills
behind
spoke
out
sharply
to
the
Russians
who
had
occupied
Loanhead
,
and
the
distant
booming
of
cannon
could
be
heard
incessantly
from
Corstorphine
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
loud
,
exultant
cry
from
Mackenzie
caused
his
companions
to
strain
their
eyes
away
to
Duddingston
,
and
there
they
saw
high
in
the
air
the
monster
aerial
machine
gradually
looming
through
the
mist
,
a
vague
and
shadowy
outline
.
<EOS>
It
had
passed
through
a
bank
of
cloud
,
and
was
gradually
reappearing
.
 
<EOS>
"
Quick
!
<EOS>
There
's
not
a
moment
to
lose
!
"
<EOS>
shrieked
Mackenzie
,
springing
to
the
lever
with
redoubled
enthusiasm
,
an
example
followed
by
the
others
.
 
<EOS>
The
motor
revolved
so
rapidly
that
it
roared
,
the
gauges
ran
high
,
the
escaping
air
hissed
so
loudly
that
Mackenzie
was
compelled
to
shout
at
the
top
of
his
voice
"
Ready
?
"
<EOS>
as
for
a
third
time
he
took
careful
aim
at
the
misty
object
now
six
miles
distant
.
 
<EOS>
The
War
Demon
was
still
over
the
Russian
camp
,
and
in
a
few
moments
,
travelling
at
that
high
rate
of
speed
,
it
would
pass
over
Arthur
's
Seat
,
and
be
enabled
to
drop
its
deadly
compounds
in
Princes
Street
.
<EOS>
But
Mackenzie
set
his
teeth
,
and
muttered
something
under
his
breath
.
 
<EOS>
"
_
<EOS>
Now
!
<EOS>
_
<EOS>
"
he
ejaculated
,
as
he
suddenly
pulled
the
lever
,
and
for
the
last
time
sent
forth
the
automatic
shower
of
destructive
shells
.
 
<EOS>
A
second
later
there
was
a
bright
flash
from
above
as
if
the
sun
itself
had
burst
,
and
then
came
a
most
terrific
explosion
,
which
caused
the
earth
to
tremble
where
they
stood
.
<EOS>
The
clouds
were
rent
asunder
by
the
frightful
detonation
,
and
down
upon
the
Russian
camp
the
debris
of
their
ingenious
invention
fell
in
a
terrible
death
-
dealing
shower
.
<EOS>
The
annihilation
of
the
dastardly
plot
to
wreck
the
city
was
complete
.
<EOS>
Small
dynamite
shells
from
Mackenzie
's
pneumatic
gun
had
struck
the
car
of
the
balloon
,
and
by
the
firing
of
half
a
ton
of
explosives
<EOS>
the
enemy
was
in
an
instant
hoist
with
his
own
petard
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
debris
fell
within
the
Russian
lines
,
some
fifty
or
sixty
picric
-
acid
bombs
--
awful
engines
of
destruction
--
which
had
not
been
exploded
in
mid
-
air
,
crashed
into
the
Muscovite
ranks
,
and
,
bursting
,
killed
and
wounded
hundreds
of
infantrymen
and
half
a
regiment
of
Cossacks
.
<EOS>
One
,
bursting
in
the
enemy
's
headquarters
,
seriously
injured
several
members
of
the
staff
;
while
another
,
falling
among
the
Engineers
'
transport
,
exploded
a
great
quantity
of
gun
-
cotton
,
which
in
its
turn
killed
a
number
of
men
and
horses
.
 
<EOS>
The
disaster
was
awful
in
its
suddenness
,
appalling
in
its
completeness
.
<EOS>
The
aeronauts
,
totally
unprepared
for
such
an
attack
,
had
been
blown
to
atoms
just
when
within
an
ace
of
success
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune
had
favoured
Britain
,
and
,
thanks
to
Mackenzie
's
vigilance
and
his
pneumatic
dynamite
gun
,
which
the
Government
had
rejected
as
a
worthless
weapon
,
the
grey
old
city
of
Edinburgh
was
still
safe
.
 
<EOS>
But
both
Russians
and
Britons
had
now
mustered
their
forces
,
and
this
,
the
first
note
sounded
of
a
second
terrific
and
desperately
-
fought
battle
,
portended
success
for
Britain
's
gallant
army
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
notwithstanding
the
disaster
<EOS>
the
enemy
sustained
by
the
blowing
up
of
their
balloon
,
their
2nd
Army
Corps
,
together
with
the
portion
of
the
3rd
Army
Corps
operating
from
their
base
at
Leith
,
succeeded
,
after
terribly
hard
fighting
and
heavy
losses
,
in
at
length
forcing
back
the
defenders
from
the
Braid
and
Blackford
Hills
,
and
the
Corstorphine
position
having
already
been
occupied
,
they
were
then
enabled
to
invest
Edinburgh
.
<EOS>
That
evening
fierce
sanguinary
fights
took
place
in
the
streets
,
for
the
people
held
the
barricades
until
the
last
moment
,
and
the
batteries
on
Calton
Hill
,
in
St.
Andrew
's
Square
,
and
at
the
Castle
effected
terrible
execution
in
conjunction
with
those
on
Arthur
's
Seat
.
<EOS>
Still
the
enemy
by
their
overwhelming
numbers
gradually
broke
down
these
defences
,
and
,
after
appalling
slaughter
on
both
sides
,
occupied
the
city
.
<EOS>
The
fighting
was
fiercest
along
Princes
Street
,
Lothian
Road
,
and
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Scotland
Street
Station
,
while
along
Cumberland
and
Great
King
Streets
the
enemy
were
swept
away
in
hundreds
by
British
Maxims
brought
to
bear
from
Drummond
Place
.
<EOS>
Along
Canongate
from
Holyrood
to
Moray
House
,
and
in
Lauriston
Place
and
the
Grassmarket
,
hand
-
to
-
hand
struggles
took
place
between
the
patriotic
civilians
and
the
foe
.
<EOS>
From
behind
their
barricades
men
of
Edinburgh
fought
valiantly
,
and
everywhere
inflicted
heavy
loss
;
<EOS>
still
the
enemy
,
pressing
onward
,
set
fire
to
a
number
of
public
buildings
,
including
the
Register
Office
,
the
Royal
Exchange
,
the
University
,
the
Liberal
and
New
Clubs
,
and
Palace
Hotel
,
with
many
other
buildings
in
Princes
Street
.
<EOS>
The
fires
,
which
broke
out
rapidly
in
succession
,
were
caused
for
the
purpose
of
producing
a
panic
,
and
in
this
the
enemy
were
successful
,
for
the
city
was
quickly
looted
,
and
the
scenes
of
ruin
,
death
,
and
desolation
that
occurred
in
its
streets
that
night
were
awful
.

In
every
quarter
the
homes

were
entered
by
the
ruthless
invader
,
who
wrecked
the
cherished
household
gods

CHAPTER
XXXII
.
 
<EOS>
FRIGHTFUL
SLAUGHTER
OUTSIDE
GLASGOW
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
misfortune
,
a
national
calamity
;
yet
our
troops
did
not
lose
heart
.
<EOS>
Commanded
as
they
were
by
Britons
,
astute
,
loyal
,
and
fearless
,
they
,
after
fighting
hard
,
fell
back
from
Edinburgh
in
order
,
and
husbanded
their
force
for
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
soon
after
dawn
the
Russians
found
themselves
severely
attacked
.
<EOS>
Exultant
over
their
success
,
they
had
,
while
sacking
Edinburgh
,
left
their
base
at
Leith
very
inadequately
protected
,
with
the
result
that
the
defenders
,
swooping
suddenly
down
upon
the
town
,
succeeded
,
with
the
assistance
of
four
coast
-
defence
ships
and
a
number
of
torpedo
boats
,
in
blowing
up
most
of
the
Russian
transports
,
and
seizing
their
ammunition
and
provisions
.
 
<EOS>
Such
an
attack
was
,
of
course
,
very
vigorously
defended
,
but
it
was
a
smart
manoeuvre
on
the
part
of
the
British
General
,
and
enabled
him
,
after
cutting
off
the
enemy
's
line
of
retreat
,
to
turn
suddenly
and
attack
the
Russians
who
were
continuing
their
destructive
campaign
through
the
streets
of
Edinburgh
.
<EOS>
This
bold
move
on
the
part
of
the
defenders
was
totally
unexpected
by
the
foe
,
which
accounted
for
the
frightful
loss
of
life
that
was
sustained
on
the
Russian
side
,
and
the
subsequent
clever
tactics
which
resulted
in
the
driving
out
of
the
invaders
from
Edinburgh
,
and
British
troops
reoccupying
that
city
.

<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
1st
Russian
Army
Corps
,
which
on
landing
had
at
once
set
out
towards
Glasgow
,
had
marched
on
in
a
great
extended
line
,
sacking
the
various
towns
through
which
they
passed
.
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
from
Linlithgow
,
Airdrie
,
and
Coatbridge
were
looted
and
burned
,
while
further
south
,
Motherwell
,
Hamilton
,
and
Bothwell
shared
the
same
fate
.
<EOS>
About
20,000
men
,
together
with
11,000
who
had
been
forced
to
evacuate
Edinburgh
,
had
at
length
advanced
a
little
beyond
Coatbridge
,
and
,
in
preparation
for
a
vigorous
siege
of
Glasgow
,
halted
within
seven
miles
of
the
city
,
with
flanks
extended
away
south
to
Motherwell
and
on
to
Wishaw
,
and
north
as
far
as
Chryston
and
Kirkintilloch
.
 
<EOS>
In
Glasgow
the
excitement
was
intense
,
and
surging
crowds
filled
the
streets
night
and
day
.
<EOS>
The
fall
of
Edinburgh
had
produced
the
greatest
sensation
,
and
the
meagre
news
of
the
disaster
telegraphed
had
scarcely
been
supplemented
when
the
report
of
the
retaking
of
"
Auld
Reekie
"
came
to
hand
,
causing
great
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
it
was
known
that
over
thirty
thousand
trained
soldiers
were
on
their
way
to
the
banks
of
the
Clyde
,
and
Glasgow
was
fevered
and
turbulent
.
<EOS>
The
scanty
business
that
had
lately
been
done
was
now
at
a
standstill
,
and
the
meagre
supplies
that
reached
there
from
America
not
being
half
sufficient
for
the
enormous
population
,
the
city
was
already
starving
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
in
other
towns
,
great
barricades
had
been
thrown
up
,
and
those
in
Gallowgate
and
Duke
Street
,
thoroughfares
by
which
Glasgow
might
be
entered
by
way
of
Parkhead
and
Dennistoun
,
were
soon
manned
by
loyal
and
patriotic
bands
of
civilians
.
<EOS>
Other
barriers
were
constructed
at
St.
Rollox
Station
,
in
Canning
Street
,
in
Monteith
Row
,
and
in
Great
Western
,
Dumbarton
,
and
Govan
Roads
.
 
<EOS>
South
of
the
river
,
Eglinton
Street
and
the
roads
at
Crosshill
were
barricaded
,
and
in
New
City
and
Garscube
Roads
in
the
north
<EOS>
there
were
also
strong
defences
.
<EOS>
All
were
held
by
enthusiastic
bodies
of
men
who
had
hastily
armed
themselves
,
confident
in
the
belief
that
our
Volunteers
and
the
small
body
of
Regulars
would
not
allow
the
invader
to
march
in
force
upon
their
city
without
a
most
determined
resistance
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
the
alarming
news
reached
Glasgow
that
the
enemy
had
actually
sacked
and
burned
Coatbridge
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
they
could
commence
looting
the
shops
in
Gallowgate
,
and
their
heavy
tramp
would
be
heard
on
the
granite
of
Trongate
and
Argyle
Street
!
<EOS>
Throughout
the
city
the
feeling
of
insecurity
increased
,
and
hourly
the
panic
assumed
greater
proportions
.
 
<EOS>
The
sun
that
day
was
obscured
by
dark
thunder
-
clouds
,
the
swirling
Clyde
flowed
on
black
beneath
its
many
bridges
,
and
the
outlook
was
everywhere
gloomy
and
ominous
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
away
on
the
hills
to
southward
,
our
small
force
of
soldiers
and
Volunteers
had
narrowly
watched
the
onward
tide
of
destroyers
,
and
carefully
laid
their
plans
.
<EOS>
The
manner
in
which
the
defensive
operations
were
conducted
is
perhaps
best
related
in
a
letter
written
by
Captain
Boyd
Drummond
of
the
1st
Battalion
Princess
Louise
's
(
Argyll
and
Sutherland
)
Highlanders
,
to
a
friend
in
London
,
and
which
was
published
with
the
accompanying
sketch
in
the
_
Daily
Graphic
_
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
as
follows:--"On
the
second
day
after
the
Russians
had
landed
<EOS>
,
Colonel
Cumberland
of
'
Ours
'
received
orders
to
move
us
from
Lanark
,
and
reconnoitre
as
far
as
possible
along
the
Carluke
road
,
with
a
view
to
taking
up
a
position
to
cover
the
advance
of
the
division
,
which
had
during
the
morning
been
considerably
reinforced
by
nearly
half
the
centre
division
from
Peebles
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
our
battalion
with
two
machine
guns
,
Colonel
Cumberland
was
in
command
of
the
1st
,
2nd
,
3rd
,
and
4th
Volunteer
Battalions
from
Greenock
,
Paisley
,
Pollokshaws
,
and
Stirling
respectively
,
the
1st
Dumbarton
from
Helensburgh
,
the
Highland
Borderers
,
and
the
Renfrew
Militia
,
together
with
a
section
of
field
artillery
,
a
field
company
of
Royal
Engineers
,
and
about
forty
cavalry
and
cyclists
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
Carluke
early
in
the
afternoon
,
we
awaited
the
return
of
scouts
,
who
had
been
pushed
on
in
advance
to
beyond
Wishaw
,
in
the
direction
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
having
reported
that
the
Russians
had
withdrawn
from
Wishaw
,
we
at
once
moved
on
to
Law
Junction
,
about
a
mile
from
that
town
,
and
finally
took
up
a
position
for
the
night
near
Waterloo
,
commanding
Wishaw
and
Overtown
.
 
<EOS>
"
Beyond
the
junction
,
towards
Glasgow
,
the
railway
,
which
the
enemy
evidently
did
not
intend
to
use
,
had
been
destroyed
,
but
scouts
from
Morningside
reported
that
the
line
to
Edinburgh
had
not
been
cut
,
and
that
the
permanent
way
remained
uninjured
.
<EOS>
Colonel
Cumberland
therefore
told
off
the
right
half
battalion
,
with
a
machine
gun
,
a
section
of
Engineers
,
and
six
cyclists
,
to
take
up
a
position
near
the
road
between
Newmains
and
Morningside
,
with
instructions
to
form
piquets
and
patrol
the
roads
north
and
east
.
<EOS>
I
was
with
No
.
1
Company
,
but
,
being
senior
captain
present
,
the
chief
gave
me
command
of
this
detachment
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
such
a
responsibility
had
been
conferred
upon
me
;
therefore
I
was
determined
not
to
be
caught
napping
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
we
arrived
at
our
ground
,
I
sent
two
cyclists
out
to
Newmains
and
two
to
Morningside
,
with
orders
to
glean
what
information
they
could
,
and
to
wait
in
the
villages
until
further
orders
,
unless
they
sighted
the
enemy
's
outposts
,
or
discovered
anything
important
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
sent
out
my
piquets
,
I
took
my
own
company
and
six
of
the
Engineers
down
to
Morningside
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
villagers
,
who
had
escaped
when
a
portion
of
the
invaders
passed
through
on
the
previous
night
,
had
returned
,
and
the
cyclists
gathered
from
them
that
we
were
close
upon
the
heels
of
the
Russian
rearguard
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
the
railway
had
not
been
destroyed
,
I
thought
that
possibly
the
invaders
intended
to
use
the
line
_
via
_
Mid
-
Calder
,
and
therefore
examined
the
station
closely
.
<EOS>
While
engaged
in
this
,
one
of
the
Engineers
suddenly
discovered
a
wire
very
carefully
concealed
along
the
line
,
and
as
we
followed
it
up
500
yards
each
way
,
and
could
find
no
connection
with
the
instrument
at
the
station
office
<EOS>
,
I
at
once
concluded
that
it
was
the
enemy
's
field
telegraph
,
forming
means
of
communication
between
their
headquarters
at
Airdrie
and
the
division
that
still
remained
in
the
Pentlands
.
 
<EOS>
"
Cutting
the
wire
,
and
attaching
the
ends
to
the
instrument
in
the
station
,
I
left
three
Engineers
,
all
expert
telegraphists
,
to
tap
the
wire
,
and
they
,
with
the
right
half
company
,
under
Lieutenant
Compton
,
formed
a
detached
post
at
this
point
.
<EOS>
I
also
left
the
cyclists
to
convey
to
me
any
messages
which
might
be
received
on
the
instrument
,
and
then
proceeded
to
Newmains
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
now
a
mere
heap
of
smouldering
ruins
;
but
,
as
at
Morningside
,
some
of
the
terrified
villagers
had
returned
,
and
they
stated
that
early
in
the
morning
they
had
seen
small
detachments
of
Russian
cavalry
pass
through
from
Bankle
,
and
proceed
north
along
the
Cleland
road
.
 
<EOS>
"
Leaving
the
left
half
company
here
with
the
other
Engineers
and
the
two
cyclists
,
under
Lieutenant
Planck
,
with
orders
to
block
the
road
and
railway
bridge
,
I
returned
to
my
piquet
line
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
later
,
however
,
a
cyclist
rode
up
with
a
copy
of
a
message
which
had
been
sent
from
the
Russian
headquarters
on
the
Pentlands
to
the
Glasgow
investing
force
.
<EOS>
The
message
was
in
cipher
,
but
,
thanks
to
the
information
furnished
by
the
spy
who
was
captured
near
Manchester
,
we
were
now
aware
of
some
of
the
codes
used
by
the
invaders
,
and
I
sent
the
messenger
on
to
the
Colonel
at
once
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
staff
was
able
to
transcribe
it
sufficiently
to
show
that
some
disaster
had
occurred
to
the
enemy
on
the
Pentlands
,
for
it
concluded
with
an
order
withdrawing
the
troops
from
Glasgow
,
in
order
to
reinforce
the
3rd
Army
Corps
in
the
fierce
battle
that
was
now
proceeding
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
stated
in
the
message
that
despatches
followed
,
so
at
once
we
were
all
on
the
alert
.
 
<EOS>
"
Almost
immediately
afterwards
news
was
received
over
our
own
telegraph
from
Carstairs
,
stating
that
a
terrific
battle
had
been
fought
along
the
valleys
between
Leadburn
,
Linton
,
and
Dolphinton
,
in
which
we
had
suffered
very
severely
,
but
we
had
nevertheless
gained
a
decisive
victory
,
for
from
dawn
until
the
time
of
telegraphing
it
was
estimated
that
no
fewer
than
12,000
Russians
had
been
killed
or
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
appeared
that
our
forces
on
the
Lammermuirs
had
moved
quickly
,
and
,
extending
along
the
ridges
,
through
Tynehead
,
and
thence
to
Heriot
,
and
on
to
Peebles
,
joined
hands
with
the
division
at
that
place
before
dawn
,
and
,
when
it
grew
light
,
had
made
a
sudden
and
desperate
attack
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
,
who
had
imagined
himself
in
a
safe
position
,
was
unprepared
,
and
from
the
first
moment
of
the
attack
the
slaughter
was
awful
.
<EOS>
As
noon
wore
on
the
battle
had
increased
,
until
now
the
invaders
had
been
outflanked
,
and
mowed
down
in
such
a
frightful
manner
,
that
the
survivors
,
numbering
nearly
six
thousand
of
all
ranks
,
had
,
finding
their
urgent
appeal
to
their
forces
at
Airdrie
met
with
no
response
,
and
imagining
that
they
too
had
been
defeated
,
at
last
surrendered
,
and
were
taken
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
receipt
of
this
intelligence
,
Colonel
Cumberland
executed
a
manoeuvre
that
was
a
marvel
of
forethought
and
smartness
.
<EOS>
The
appeal
to
Airdrie
for
help
had
,
of
course
,
not
been
received
,
but
in
its
place
he
ordered
a
message
in
Russian
to
be
sent
along
the
enemy
's
field
telegraph
to
the
force
advancing
on
Glasgow
in
the
following
words
:
'
Remain
at
Airdrie
.
<EOS>
Do
not
advance
on
Glasgow
before
we
join
you
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
are
defeated
with
heavy
losses
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Our
advance
guard
will
be
with
you
in
twenty
-
four
hours
.
<EOS>
Signed
--
Drukovitch
.
'
 
<EOS>
"
This
having
been
despatched
,
he
reported
by
telegraph
to
the
headquarters
at
Carstairs
what
he
had
done
,
and
then
our
whole
force
immediately
moved
as
far
as
Bellshill
,
in
the
direction
of
Glasgow
.
<EOS>
Here
we
came
across
the
Russian
outposts
,
and
a
sharp
fight
ensued
.
<EOS>
After
half
an
hour
,
however
,
we
succeeded
in
cutting
them
off
and
totally
annihilating
them
,
afterwards
establishing
ourselves
in
Bellshill
until
reinforcements
could
arrive
.
<EOS>
We
were
now
only
six
miles
from
the
Russian
headquarters
at
Airdrie
,
and
they
,
on
receipt
of
our
fictitious
message
,
had
withdrawn
from
the
Clyde
bank
,
and
extended
farther
north
over
the
hills
as
far
as
Milngavie
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
were
thus
enabled
to
watch
and
wait
in
Bellshill
undisturbed
throughout
the
night
;
and
while
the
enemy
were
eagerly
expecting
their
legions
of
infantry
who
were
to
swoop
down
and
conquer
Glasgow
,
we
remained
content
in
the
knowledge
that
the
hour
of
conquest
was
close
at
hand
.
 
<EOS>
"
A
short
,
hasty
rest
,
and
we
were
astir
again
long
before
the
dawn
.
<EOS>
Just
at
daybreak
,
however
,
the
advance
guard
of
our
force
from
Carstairs
,
which
had
been
on
the
march
during
the
night
,
came
into
touch
with
us
,
and
in
an
hour
the
combined
right
and
centre
divisions
of
the
British
had
opened
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
"
Our
fighting
front
extended
from
Wishaw
right
across
to
Condorrat
,
with
batteries
on
Torrance
and
the
hill
at
New
Monkland
,
while
another
strong
line
was
pushed
across
from
Cambuslang
to
Parkhead
,
and
thence
to
Millerston
,
for
the
protection
of
Glasgow
.
 
<EOS>
"
Thus
,
almost
before
our
guns
uttered
their
voice
of
defiance
,
we
had
surrounded
the
enemy
,
and
throughout
the
morning
the
fighting
was
most
sanguinary
and
desperate
.
<EOS>
Our
batteries
did
excellent
service
;
still
,
it
must
be
remembered
we
had
attacked
a
well
-
trained
force
of
over
thirty
thousand
men
,
and
they
had
many
more
guns
than
we
possessed
.
<EOS>
No
doubt
the
fictitious
despatch
we
had
sent
had
prevented
the
Russian
commander
from
advancing
on
Glasgow
during
the
night
,
as
he
had
intended
;
and
now
,
finding
himself
so
vigorously
attacked
by
two
divisions
which
he
believed
had
been
cut
up
and
annihilated
,
all
his
calculations
were
completely
upset
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
was
well
for
us
that
this
was
so
<EOS>
,
otherwise
we
might
have
fared
much
worse
than
we
did
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Cossacks
and
Dragoons
wrought
frightful
havoc
among
our
infantry
;
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
the
fire
discipline
of
the
latter
was
magnificent
.
<EOS>
Every
bit
of
cover
on
the
hills
seem
to
bristle
with
hidden
rifles
,
that
emptied
their
magazines
without
smoke
and
with
fatal
effect
.
<EOS>
Many
a
gallant
dash
was
made
by
our
men
,
the
Volunteers
especially
displaying
conspicuous
courage
.
<EOS>
The
1st
Dumbartonshire
Volunteers
,
under
Col
.
Thomson
,
V.D.
,
the
1st
Renfrewshire
,
under
Col
.
Lamont
,
V.D.
,
and
the
4th
Battalion
Argyll
and
Sutherland
Highlanders
,
under
Col
.
D.
M'Fayden
,
V.D.
,
operated
together
with
magnificent
success
,
for
they
completely
cut
up
a
strong
Russian
detachment
on
the
Glasgow
road
beyond
Uddingston
,
driving
them
out
of
the
wood
near
Daldowie
,
and
there
annihilating
them
,
and
afterwards
holding
their
own
on
the
banks
of
the
North
Calder
without
suffering
very
much
loss
.
<EOS>
They
handled
their
Maxims
as
smartly
as
any
body
of
Regulars
;
and
indeed
,
throughout
the
day
their
performances
everywhere
were
marked
by
steady
discipline
and
cool
courage
that
was
in
the
highest
degree
commendable
.
 
<EOS>
"
About
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
the
battle
was
at
its
height
.
<EOS>
Under
the
blazing
sun
that
beat
down
upon
us
mercilessly
,
my
battalion
fought
on
,
feeling
confident
that
the
enemy
were
gradually
being
defeated
.
<EOS>
The
slaughter
everywhere
was
frightful
,
and
the
green
hillsides
and
fields
were
covered
with
dead
and
dying
soldiers
of
the
Tsar
.
<EOS>
The
grey
coats
were
soaked
with
blood
,
and
dark
,
ugly
stains
dyed
the
grass
of
the
fertile
meadows
beside
the
winding
Clyde
.
<EOS>
Since
their
sudden
landing
in
Scotland
,
the
enemy
's
early
successes
had
been
followed
by
defeat
after
defeat
.
<EOS>
Their
transports
had
been
destroyed
,
their
ammunition
and
stores
seized
,
both
their
2nd
and
3rd
Army
Corps
had
been
totally
annihilated
,
leaving
nearly
twelve
thousand
men
in
our
hands
as
prisoners
,
and
now
the
defeat
of
this
force
of
picked
regiments
,
who
had
,
on
landing
,
immediately
marched
straight
across
Scotland
,
would
effect
a
crushing
and
decisive
blow
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
struggle
was
terrific
,
the
din
deafening
,
the
wholesale
butchery
appalling
.
<EOS>
Our
men
knew
they
were
fighting
for
Caledonia
and
their
Queen
,
and
their
conduct
,
from
the
first
moment
of
hostilities
,
until
stray
bullets
laid
them
low
one
after
another
,
was
magnificent
;
they
were
splendid
examples
of
the
true
,
loyal
,
and
fearless
Briton
,
who
will
fight
on
even
while
his
life
-
blood
ebbs
.
 
<EOS>
"
Evening
fell
,
but
the
continuous
firing
did
not
cease
.
<EOS>
The
sun
sank
red
and
angry
into
dark
storm
-
clouds
behind
the
long
range
of
purple
hills
beyond
the
Clyde
,
but
the
clash
of
arms
continued
over
hill
and
dale
on
the
east
of
Glasgow
,
and
<EOS>
we
,
exerting
every
effort
in
our
successful
attempt
to
hold
the
five
converging
roads
near
Broomhouse
,
knew
not
which
side
were
victors
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suddenly
I
received
orders
to
send
over
a
small
detachment
to
block
the
two
roads
at
Baillieston
,
the
one
a
main
road
leading
up
from
Coatbridge
,
and
the
other
from
the
hilly
country
around
Old
Monkland
,
where
the
struggle
was
fiercest
.
<EOS>
Sending
Lieutenant
Planck
over
immediately
with
a
detachment
and
several
cyclists
,
I
followed
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
found
he
had
blocked
both
roads
in
the
centre
of
the
little
Scotch
village
,
and
had
occupied
the
inn
situated
between
the
two
roads
,
leaving
just
sufficient
space
for
his
cyclists
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Looking
towards
the
city
we
could
see
that
the
hills
on
our
left
were
occupied
by
British
redcoats
.
<EOS>
In
the
village
the
quaint
little
low
-
built
cottages
,
with
their
stairs
outside
,
were
all
closed
and
deserted
,
and
the
place
seemed
strangely
quiet
after
the
exciting
scenes
and
ceaseless
deafening
din
.
 
<EOS>
"
Taking
six
of
Planck
's
men
and
the
cyclists
about
a
mile
towards
Coatbridge
,
I
posted
them
at
the
cross
-
roads
beyond
Rhind
House
,
sending
the
cyclists
out
along
the
valley
to
Dikehead
.
<EOS>
All
was
quiet
in
our
immediate
vicinity
for
some
time
,
until
suddenly
we
discerned
the
cyclists
coming
back
.
<EOS>
They
reported
that
they
had
seen
cavalry
.
<EOS>
This
,
then
,
must
be
a
detachment
of
the
enemy
,
who
in
all
probability
were
retreating
.
<EOS>
I
at
once
sent
the
cyclists
back
to
inform
Planck
,
and
to
tell
him
we
should
not
take
a
hand
in
the
game
until
we
had
allowed
them
to
pass
<EOS>
and
they
had
discovered
his
barricade
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
we
could
distinctly
hear
them
approaching
.
<EOS>
We
were
all
well
under
cover
,
but
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
only
an
escort
.
 
<EOS>
"
They
were
galloping
,
and
had
evidently
come
a
long
distance
by
some
circuitous
route
,
and
had
not
taken
part
in
the
fighting
.
<EOS>
I
counted
five
--
two
Cossacks
in
advance
,
then
about
forty
yards
behind
a
shabbily
-
dressed
civilian
on
horseback
,
and
about
forty
yards
behind
him
two
more
Cossacks
.
<EOS>
They
appeared
to
expect
no
interruption
,
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
Cossacks
were
escorting
the
civilian
over
to
the
Russian
position
away
beyond
Hogganfield
Loch
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
clear
,
I
formed
my
men
up
on
each
side
of
the
road
to
await
events
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
had
no
occasion
to
remain
long
in
expectation
,
for
soon
afterwards
the
stillness
was
broken
by
shouts
and
a
few
rapid
shots
,
and
then
we
could
hear
two
horses
galloping
back
.
<EOS>
One
was
riderless
,
and
a
corporal
who
attempted
to
stop
it
was
knocked
down
and
seriously
injured
;
but
the
other
had
a
rider
,
and
as
he
neared
us
I
could
see
he
was
the
civilian
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
must
stop
him
at
all
costs
.
 
<EOS>
"
So
,
ordering
the
men
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
to
lie
down
,
we
gave
him
a
section
volley
from
one
side
as
he
rushed
past
.
<EOS>
The
horse
was
badly
hit
,
and
stumbled
,
throwing
its
rider
,
who
was
at
once
secured
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
him
from
disposing
of
anything
,
we
bound
him
securely
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
Cossacks
had
been
shot
and
the
other
two
captured
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
civilian
,
and
in
his
saddle
-
bags
,
we
found
a
number
of
cipher
despatches
,
elaborate
plans
showing
how
Glasgow
was
defended
,
and
an
autograph
letter
from
the
Russian
General
Drukovitch
,
giving
him
instructions
to
enter
Glasgow
alone
by
way
of
Partick
,
and
to
await
him
there
until
the
city
fell
.
 
<EOS>
"
But
the
city
was
never
invested
.
<EOS>
An
hour
after
we
had
sent
this
mysterious
civilian
--
who
spoke
English
with
a
foreign
accent
--
over
to
the
Colonel
,
our
onslaught
became
doubly
desperate
.
<EOS>
In
the
dusk
,
regiment
after
regiment
of
Russians
were
simply
swept
away
by
the
cool
and
deliberate
fire
of
the
British
,
who
,
being
reinforced
by
my
battalion
and
others
,
wrought
splendid
execution
in
the
enemy
's
main
body
,
forced
back
upon
us
at
Baillieston
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
as
night
fell
,
a
report
was
spread
that
General
Drukovitch
had
surrendered
.
<EOS>
This
proved
true
.
<EOS>
With
his
2nd
and
3rd
Army
Corps
annihilated
,
and
his
transports
and
base
in
our
hands
,
he
was
compelled
to
acknowledge
himself
vanquished
;
therefore
,
by
nine
o'clock
hostilities
had
ceased
,
and
during
that
night
nearly
six
thousand
survivors
of
the
1st
Russian
Army
Corps
were
taken
prisoners
,
and
marched
in
triumph
into
Glasgow
amid
the
wildest
excitement
of
the
populace
.
<EOS>
This
desperate
attempt
to
invest
Glasgow
had
cost
the
Russians
no
fewer
than
25,000
men
in
killed
and
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
capture
we
effected
near
Baillieston
turned
out
to
be
of
a
most
important
character
.
<EOS>
When
searched
at
headquarters
,
a
visiting
-
card
was
found
concealed
upon
the
man
,
and
this
gave
our
Colonel
a
clue
.
<EOS>
The
man
has
since
been
identified
by
one
of
his
intimate
friends
as
a
person
well
known
in
London
society
,
who
poses
as
a
wealthy
German
,
the
Count
von
Beilstein
!
<EOS>
It
is
alleged
that
he
has
for
several
years
been
living
in
the
metropolis
and
acting
as
an
expert
spy
in
the
Secret
Service
of
the
Tsar
.
<EOS>
He
was
sent
handcuffed
,
under
a
strong
escort
,
to
London
a
few
days
after
the
battle
,
and
if
all
I
hear
be
true
,
some
highly
sensational
disclosures
will
be
made
regarding
his
adventurous
career
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII

<EOS>
MARCH
OF
THE
FRENCH
ON
LONDON
.
  
<EOS>
South
of
the
Thames
,
where
the
gigantic
force
of
French
and
Russians
,
numbering
nearly
two
hundred
thousand
of
all
arms
,
had
been
prevented
from
attacking
London
by
our
Volunteers
and
Regulars
massed
along
the
Surrey
Hills
,
the
slaughter
on
both
sides
had
been
frightful
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
was
indeed
not
for
a
dynasty
,
but
for
the
very
existence
of
Britain
as
an
independent
nation
.
 
<EOS>
Sussex
had
been
devastated
,
but
Kent
still
held
out
,
and
Chatham
remained
in
the
possession
of
the
defenders
.
 
<EOS>
The
rout
of
the
British
at
Horsham
prior
to
the
march
of
the
left
column
of
invaders
to
Birmingham
was
succeeded
by
defeat
after
defeat
,
the
engagements
each
day
illustrating
painfully
that
by
force
of
overwhelming
numbers
the
invaders
were
gradually
nearing
their
goal
--
the
mighty
Capital
of
our
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
Gallant
stands
were
made
by
our
Regulars
at
East
Grinstead
,
Crawley
,
Alfold
,
and
from
Haslemere
across
Hind
Head
Common
to
Frensham
.
<EOS>
At
each
of
these
places
,
long
,
desperately
-
fought
battles
with
the
French
had
taken
place
through
the
hot
September
days,--our
Regular
forces
confident
in
the
stubborn
resistance
that
would
be
offered
by
the
long
unbroken
line
of
Volunteers
occupying
the
range
of
hills
behind
.
<EOS>
Our
signallers
had
formed
a
long
line
of
stations
from
Reculvers
and
Star
Hill
,
south
of
the
Medway
Fortress
,
to
Blue
Bell
Hill
,
between
Chatham
and
Maidstone
,
thence
through
Snodland
,
Wrotham
,
Westerham
,
and
Limpsfield
to
Caterham
,
and
from
there
on
through
Reigate
Park
,
Boxhill
,
St.
Martha
's
,
and
over
the
Hog
's
Back
to
Aldershot
.
<EOS>
With
flags
in
day
and
lamps
by
night
messages
constantly
passed
,
and
communication
was
thus
maintained
by
this
means
as
well
as
by
the
field
telegraph
,
which
,
however
,
on
several
occasions
had
been
cut
by
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
although
our
soldiers
fought
day
after
day
with
that
pluck
characteristic
of
the
true
Briton
,
fortune
nevertheless
seemed
to
have
forsaken
us
,
and
even
although
we
inflicted
frightful
losses
upon
the
French
all
round
,
still
they
gradually
forced
back
the
defenders
over
the
Surrey
border
.
<EOS>
Terror
,
ruin
,
and
death
had
been
spread
by
the
invading
Gauls
.
<EOS>
English
homes
were
sacked
,
French
soldiers
bivouaced
in
Sussex
pastures
,
and
the
ripening
corn
was
trodden
down
and
stained
with
blood
.
<EOS>
The
white
dusty
highways
leading
from
London
to
the
sea
were
piled
with
unheeded
corpses
that
were
fearful
to
gaze
upon
,
yet
Britannia
toiled
on
undaunted
in
this
desperate
struggle
for
the
retention
of
her
Empire
.
 
<EOS>
After
our
defeat
at
Horsham
,
the
Russians
had
contented
themselves
by
merely
driving
back
the
defenders
to
a
line
of
resistance
from
Aldershot
to
the
north
of
Bagshot
,
and
then
they
had
marched
onward
to
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
From
Horsham
,
however
,
two
columns
of
the
invaders
,
mostly
French
,
and
numbering
over
twenty
thousand
each
,
had
advanced
on
Guildford
and
Dorking
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
a
strong
demonstration
was
made
by
the
enemy
in
the
country
north
of
Eastbourne
and
Hailsham
,
by
which
the
whole
of
the
district
in
the
triangle
from
Bexhill
to
Heathfield
,
and
thence
to
Cuckfield
and
Steyning
,
fell
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
The
British
,
however
,
had
massed
a
strong
force
to
prevent
the
enemy
making
their
way
into
West
Kent
,
and
still
held
their
own
along
the
hills
stretching
from
Crowborough
to
Ticehurst
,
and
from
Etchingham
,
through
Brightling
and
Ashburnham
,
down
to
Battle
and
Hastings
.
 
<EOS>
The
north
of
London
had
during
the
weeks
of
hostilities
been
strongly
guarded
by
Volunteers
and
Regulars
,
for
information
of
a
contemplated
landing
in
Essex
had
been
received
;
and
although
the
defenders
had
not
yet
fired
a
shot
,
they
were
eagerly
looking
forward
to
a
chance
of
proving
their
worth
,
as
their
comrades
in
other
parts
of
England
had
already
done
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
tactics
of
the
invaders
could
not
be
understood
,
for
it
had
been
concluded
that
they
would
naturally
follow
up
their
successes
on
landing
with
a
rapid
advance
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
of
course
,
evident
that
the
vigorous
demonstrations
made
in
the
North
and
other
parts
of
Britain
were
intended
with
a
view
to
drawing
as
many
troops
as
possible
from
the
defence
of
London
,
and
dispose
of
them
in
detail
before
surrounding
the
capital
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
to
the
dismay
of
the
enemy
,
no
blow
they
delivered
in
other
parts
of
our
country
had
had
the
desired
effect
of
weakening
the
defensive
lines
around
London
.
<EOS>
At
the
opening
of
the
campaign
it
had
been
the
enemy
's
intention
to
reduce
London
by
a
blockade
,
which
could
perhaps
have
been
successfully
carried
out
<EOS>
had
they
landed
a
strong
force
in
Essex
.
<EOS>
The
troops
who
were
intended
to
land
there
were
,
however
,
sent
to
Scotland
instead
,
and
the
fact
that
they
had
been
annihilated
outside
Glasgow
resulted
in
a
decision
to
march
at
once
upon
the
metropolis
.
 
<EOS>
Advancing
from
Horsham
,
the
French
right
column
,
numbering
20,000
men
with
about
70
guns
,
<EOS>
had
,
after
desperate
fighting
,
at
last
reached
Leatherhead
,
having
left
a
battalion
in
support
at
Dorking
.
<EOS>
The
British
had
resolutely
contested
every
step
the
French
had
advanced
,
and
the
slaughter
around
Dorking
had
been
awful
,
while
the
fighting
across
Fetcham
Downs
and
around
Ockley
and
Bear
Green
had
resulted
in
frightful
loss
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Regulars
and
Volunteers
,
notwithstanding
their
gallantry
,
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
gradually
driven
back
by
the
enormous
numbers
that
had
commenced
the
onslaught
,
and
were
at
last
thrown
back
westward
in
disorder
,
halting
at
Ripley
.
<EOS>
Here
the
survivors
snatched
a
hasty
rest
,
and
they
were
during
the
night
reinforced
by
a
contingent
of
Regulars
who
had
come
over
from
Windsor
and
Hounslow
.
<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
these
reinforcements
,
the
Colonel
,
well
knowing
how
serious
was
the
situation
now
our
first
line
of
defence
had
been
broken
,
sent
out
a
flying
column
from
Ripley
,
while
the
main
body
marched
to
Great
Bookham
,
with
the
result
that
Leatherhead
,
now
in
the
occupation
of
the
French
,
was
from
both
sides
vigorously
attacked
.
<EOS>
The
British
flying
column
threatening
the
enemy
from
the
north
was
,
however
,
quickly
checked
by
the
French
guns
,
and
in
the
transmission
of
an
order
a
most
serious
blunder
occurred
,
leading
to
the
impossibility
of
a
retreat
upon
Ripley
,
for
unfortunately
the
order
,
wrongly
given
,
resulted
in
the
blowing
up
by
mistake
of
the
bridges
over
the
river
Mole
by
which
they
had
crossed
,
and
which
they
wanted
to
use
again
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
was
that
for
a
time
this
force
was
compelled
to
remain
,
at
terrible
cost
,
right
under
the
fire
of
the
French
entrenched
position
at
Leatherhead
;
but
the
enemy
were
fortunately
not
strong
enough
to
follow
up
this
advantage
,
and
as
they
occupied
a
strong
strategical
position
they
were
content
to
await
the
arrival
of
their
huge
main
body
,
now
on
the
move
,
and
which
they
expected
would
reach
Leatherhead
during
that
night
.
<EOS>
After
more
fierce
fighting
,
lasting
one
whole
breathless
day
,
the
defenders
were
annihilated
,
while
their
main
body
approaching
from
the
south
also
fell
into
a
trap
.
<EOS>
For
several
hours
a
fierce
battle
also
raged
between
Dorking
and
Mickleham
.
<EOS>
The
British
battery
on
Box
Hill
wrought
awful
havoc
in
the
French
lines
,
yet
gradually
the
enemy
silenced
our
guns
and
cut
up
our
forces
.
 
<EOS>
The
invaders
were
now
advancing
in
open
order
over
the
whole
of
Sussex
and
the
west
of
Kent
,
and
on
the
same
day
as
the
battle
was
fought
at
Leatherhead
,
the
high
ground
south
of
Sevenoaks
,
extending
from
Wimlet
Hill
to
Chart
Common
,
fell
into
their
hands
,
the
British
suffering
severely
;
while
two
of
our
Volunteer
batteries
in
the
vicinity
were
surprised
and
seized
by
a
French
flying
column
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
another
French
column
,
numbering
nearly
twenty
thousand
infantry
and
cavalry
,
had
advanced
from
Alfold
,
burning
Ewhurst
and
Cranley
,
and
after
a
desperately
-
contested
engagement
they
captured
the
British
batteries
on
the
hills
at
Hascombe
and
Hambledon
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
the
French
advance
guard
,
though
suffering
terrible
loss
,
successfully
attacked
the
battery
of
Regulars
on
the
hill
at
Wonersh
,
and
Godalming
having
been
invested
,
they
commenced
another
vigorous
attack
upon
the
strong
line
of
British
Regulars
and
Volunteers
at
Guildford
,
where
about
fourteen
thousand
men
were
massed
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
hills
from
Gomshall
to
Seale
our
brave
civilian
defenders
had
remained
throughout
the
hostilities
ready
to
repel
any
attack
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
as
the
days
passed
,
and
no
demonstration
had
been
made
in
their
direction
,
they
had
grown
impatient
,
until
at
length
this
sudden
and
ferocious
onslaught
had
been
made
,
and
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
with
an
advancing
army
of
almost
thrice
their
strength
.
<EOS>
Among
the
Volunteer
battalions
holding
the
position
were

Commencing
before

,
the
battle
was
fierce
and
sanguinary
almost
from
the
time
the
first
shots
were
exchanged
.

The
eight
60-pounder

in

manned

commanded

effected
splendid
defensive
work

Indeed
,
it
was
this
redoubt
,
with
three
new
ones
between
Guildford
and
Gomshall
,
and
another
on
the
Hog
's
Back
,
which
held
the
enemy
in
check
for
a
considerable
time
;
and
had
there
been
a
larger
number
of
a
similar
strength
,
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
French
would
ever
have
accomplished
their
design
upon
Guildford
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pewley
Fort
,
built
in
the
solid
chalk
,
and
surrounded
by
a
wide
ditch
,
kept
up
a
continuous
fire
upon
the
dense
masses
of
the
enemy
,
and
swept
away
hundreds
of
unfortunate
fellows
as
they
rushed
madly
onward
;
while
the
Volunteer
batteries
and
the
Maxims
of
the
infantry
battalions
poured
upon
the
invaders
a
devastating
hail
of
lead
.
 
<EOS>
From
Farnham
,
the
line
through
Odiham
and
Aldershot
was
held
by
a
force
increasing
hourly
in
strength
;
therefore
the
enemy
were
unable
to
get
over
to
Farnborough
to
outflank
the
defenders
.
<EOS>
Through
that
brilliant
,
sunny
September
day
the
slaughter
was
terrible
in
every
part
of
the
enemy
's
column
,
and
it
was
about
noon
believed
that
they
would
find
their
positions
at
Wonersh
and
Godalming
untenable
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
with
a
dogged
persistency
unusual
to
our
Gallic
neighbours
,
they
continued
to
fight
with
unquelled
vigour
.

the
1st
and
2nd
Wiltshire
,
holding
very
important
ground
over
against
Puttenham
,
bore
their
part
with
magnificent
courage
,
but
were
at
length
cut
up
in
a
most
horrible
manner
;
while
the
1st
Bedfordshire
,
who
,
with
a
body
of
Regulars
valiantly
held
the
road
running
over
the
hills
from
Gomshall
to
Merrow
,
fought
splendidly
;
but
they
too
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
subsequently
annihilated
.
 
<EOS>
Over
hill
and
dale
,
stretching
away
to
the
Sussex
border
,
the
rattle
and
din
of
war
sounded
incessantly
,
and
as
hour
after
hour
passed
,
hundreds
of
Britons
and
Frenchmen
dyed
the
brown
,
sun
-
baked
grass
with
their
blood
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
Volunteer
battalions
who
had
manoeuvred
over
that
ground
at
many
an
Eastertide
had
little
dreamed
that
they
would
have
one
day
to
raise
their
rifles
in
earnest
for
the
defence
of
their
home
and
Queen
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
practice
they
had
had
now
served
them
well
,
for
in
one
instance
the
1st
Berkshire
succeeded
by
a
very
smart
manoeuvre
in
totally
sweeping
away
several
troops
of
Cuirassiers
,
while
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
half
an
infantry
battalion
of
Regulars
attacked
a
large
force
of
Zouaves
on
the
Compton
Road
,
and
fought
them
successfully
almost
hand
to
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
long
,
toilsome
day
the
battle
continued
with
unabated
fury
,
and
as
the
sun
went
down
there
was
no
cessation
of
hostilities
.
<EOS>
A
force
of
our
Regulars
,
extending
from
Farnham
over
Hind
Head
Common
,
fell
suddenly
upon
a
large
body
of
French
infantry
,
and
,
outflanking
them
,
managed
--
after
a
most
frightful
encounter
,
in
which
they
lost
nearly
half
their
men
--
to
totally
annihilate
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
connection
with
this
incident
,
a
squadron
of
the
5th
Dragoon
Guards
made
a
magnificent
charge
up
a
steep
hill
literally
to
the
muzzles
of
the
guns
of
a
French
battery
,
and
by
their
magnificent
pluck
captured
it
.
<EOS>
Still
,
notwithstanding
the
bravery
of
our
defenders
,
and
their
fierce
determination
to
sweep
away
their
foe
,
it
seemed
when
the
sun
finally
disappeared
that
the
fortunes
of
war
were
once
more
against
us
,
for
the
French
had
now
received
huge
reinforcements
,
and
Dorking
and
Leatherhead
having
already
passed
into
their
hands
two
days
previously
,
they
were
enabled
to
make
their
final
assault
a
most
savage
and
terrific
one
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
frightful
;
it
crushed
us
!
<EOS>
In
the
falling
gloom
our
men
fought
desperately
for
their
lives
,
but
,
alas
!
<EOS>
one
after
another
our
positions
were
carried
by
the
invaders
literally
at
the
point
of
the
bayonet
,
and
ere
the
moon
rose
<EOS>
Guildford
had
fallen
into
the
enemy
's
hands
,
and
our
depleted
battalions
had
been
compelled
to
retire
in
disorder
east
to
Effingham
and
west
to
Farnham
.
<EOS>
Those
who
went
to
Effingham
joined
at
midnight
the
column
who
had
made
an
unsuccessful
effort
to
recover
Leatherhead
,
and
then
bivouaced
in
Oldlands
Copse
.
<EOS>
The
number
of
wounded
in
the
battles
of
Guildford
and
Leatherhead
was
enormous
.
<EOS>
At
Mickleham
the
British
hospital
flag
floated
over
St.
Michael
's
Church
,
the
Priory
at
Cherkley
,
Chapel
Farm
,
and
on
Mickleham
Hall
,
a
portion
of
which
still
remained
intact
,
although
the
building
had
been
looted
by
Zouaves
.
<EOS>
In
Leatherhead
the
French
had
established
hospitals
at
Givons
Grove
,
Vale
Lodge
,
Elmbank
,
and
in
the
Church
of
St.
Mary
and
the
parish
church
at
Fetcham
.
<EOS>
At
Guildford
,
in
addition
to
the
field
hospitals
on
Albury
Downs
and
behind
St.
Catherine
's
Hill
,
Holden
,
Warren
,
and
Tyting
Farms
,
Sutton
Place
and
Loseley
were
filled
with
wounded
French
infantrymen
and
British
prisoners
,
and
many
schools
and
buildings
,
including
the
Guildhall
in
Guildford
town
,
bore
the
red
cross
.
 
<EOS>
At
two
most
important
strategic
points
the
first
line
defending
London
had
now
been
broken
,
and
the
British
officers
knew
that
it
would
require
every
effort
on
our
part
to
recover
our
lost
advantages
.
<EOS>
The
metropolis
was
now
seriously
threatened
;
for
soon
after
dawn
on
the
following
day
two
great
French
columns
,
one
from
Guildford
and
the
other
from
Leatherhead
,
were
advancing
north
towards
the
Thames
!
<EOS>
The
enemy
had
established
telegraphic
communication
between
the
two
towns
,
and
balloons
that
had
been
sent
up
from
Guildford
and
Ashstead
to
reconnoitre
had
reported
that
the
second
line
of
the
British
defence
had
been
formed
from
Kingston
,
through
Wimbledon
,
Tooting
,
Streatham
,
and
Upper
Norwood
,
and
thence
across
_
via
_
Sydenham
to
Lewisham
and
Greenwich
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
upon
this
second
line
of
defence
that
the
French
,
with
their
enormous
force
of
artillery
,
now
marched
.
<EOS>
The
Leatherhead
column
,
with
their
main
body
about
one
day
's
march
behind
,
took
the
route
through
Epsom
to
Mitcham
,
while
the
troops
from
Guildford
pushed
on
through
Ripley
,
Cobham
,
and
Esher
.
 
<EOS>
This
advance
occupied
a
day
,
and
when
a
halt
was
made
for
the
night
the
enemy
's
front
extended
from
Walton
to
Thames
Ditton
,
thence
across
Kingston
Common
and
Malden
to
Mitcham
.
<EOS>
Bivouacing
,
they
faced
the
British
second
line
of
defence
,
and
waited
for
the
morrow
to
commence
their
onslaught
.
<EOS>
In
London
the
alarming
news
of
the
enemy
's
success
caused
a
panic
such
as
had
never
before
been
experienced
in
the
metropolis
.
<EOS>
During
the
long
anxious
weeks
that
the
enemy
had
been
held
within
bounds
by
our
Volunteers
,
London
had
never
fully
realised
what
bombardment
would
mean
.
<EOS>
While
the
French
were
beyond
the
Surrey
Hills
,
Londoners
felt
secure
;
and
the
intelligence
received
of
the
enemy
's
utter
rout
at
Newcastle
,
Manchester
,
Edinburgh
,
and
Glasgow
added
considerably
to
this
sense
of
security
.
 
<EOS>
London
,
alas
!
<EOS>
was
starving
.
<EOS>
Business
was
suspended
;
trains
no
longer
left
the
termini
;
omnibuses
,
trams
,
and
cabs
had
ceased
running
,
the
horses
having
been
pressed
into
military
service
,
and
those
which
had
not
had
been
killed
and
eaten
.
<EOS>
The
outlook
everywhere
,
even
during
those
blazing
sunny
days
and
clear
moonlit
nights
,
was
cheerless
and
dispiriting
.
<EOS>
The
bright
sun
seemed
strangely
incongruous
with
the
black
war
-
clouds
that
overhung
the
gigantic
city
,
with
its
helpless
,
starving
,
breathless
millions
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
sun
-
baked
,
dusty
streets
the
roar
of
traffic
no
longer
sounded
,
but
up
and
down
the
principal
thoroughfares
of
the
City
and
the
West
End
the
people
prowled
,
lean
and
hungry
--
emaciated
victims
of
this
awful
struggle
between
nations
--
seeking
vainly
for
food
to
satisfy
the
terrible
pangs
consuming
them
.
<EOS>
The
hollow
cheek
,
the
thin
,
sharp
nose
,
the
dark
-
ringed
glassy
eye
of
one
and
all
,
told
too
plainly
of
the
widespread
suffering
,
and
little
surprise
was
felt
at
the
great
mortality
in
every
quarter
.
 
<EOS>
In
Kensington
and
Belgravia
the
distress
was
quite
as
keen
as
in
Whitechapel
and
Hackney
,
and
both
rich
and
poor
mingled
in
the
gloomy
,
dismal
streets
,
wandering
aimlessly
over
the
great
Modern
Babylon
,
which
the
enemy
were
now
plotting
to
destroy
.
 
<EOS>
The
horrors
of
those
intensely
anxious
days
of
terror
were
unspeakable
.
<EOS>
The
whole
machinery
of
life
in
the
Great
City
had
been
disorganised
,
and
now
London
lay
like
an
octopus
,
with
her
long
arms
extended
in
every
direction
,
north
and
south
of
the
Thames
,
inert
,
helpless
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
Over
the
gigantic
Capital
of
the
World
hung
the
dark
Shadow
of
Death
.
<EOS>
By
day
and
by
night
its
ghastly
presence
could
be
felt
;
its
hideous
realities
crushed
the
heart
from
those
who
would
face
the
situation
with
smiling
countenance
.
<EOS>
London
's
wealth
availed
her
not
in
this
critical
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Grim
,
spectral
,
unseen
<EOS>
,
the
Destroying
Angel
held
the
sword
over
her
,
ready
to
strike
!

CHAPTER
XXXIV
.
 
<EOS>
LOOTING
IN
THE
SUBURBS
.
  
<EOS>
While
famished
men
crept
into
Hyde
Park
and
Kensington
Gardens
and
there
expired
under
the
trees
of
absolute
hunger
,
and
starving
women
with
babes
at
their
breasts
sank
upon
doorsteps
and
died
,
the
more
robust
Londoners
had
,
on
hearing
of
the
enemy
's
march
on
the
metropolis
,
gone
south
to
augment
the
second
line
of
defence
.
<EOS>
For
several
weeks
huge
barricades
had
been
thrown
up
in
the
principal
roads
approaching
London
from
the
south
.
<EOS>
The
strongest
of
these
were
opposite
the
Convalescent
Home
on
Kingston
Hill
,
in
Coombe
Lane
close
to
Raynes
Park
Station
,
in
the
Morden
Road
at
Merton
Abbey
,
opposite
Lynwood
in
the
Tooting
Road
;
while
nearer
London
,
on
the
same
road
,
there
was
a
strong
one
with
machine
guns
on
the
crest
of
Balham
Hill
,
and
another
in
Clapham
Road
.
<EOS>
At
Streatham
Hill
,
about
one
hundred
yards
from
the
hospital
,
earthworks
had
been
thrown
up
,
and
several
guns
brought
into
position
;
while
at
Beulah
Hill
,
Norwood
,
opposite
the
Post
Office
at
Upper
Sydenham
,
at
the
Half
Moon
at
Herne
Hill
,
and
in
many
of
the
roads
between
Honor
Oak
and
Denmark
Hill
,
barricades
had
been
constructed
and
banked
up
with
bags
and
baskets
filled
with
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Though
these
defences
were
held
by
enthusiastic
civilians
of
all
classes,--professional
men
,
artisans
,
and
tradesmen,--yet
our
second
line
of
defence
,
distinct
,
of
course
,
from
the
local
barricades
,
was
a
very
weak
one
.
<EOS>
We
had
relied
upon
our
magnificent
strategic
positions
on
the
Surrey
Hills
,
and
had
not
made
sufficient
provision
in
case
of
a
sudden
reverse
.
<EOS>
Our
second
line
,
stretching
from
Croydon
up
to
South
Norwood
,
thence
to
Streatham
and
along
the
railway
line
to
Wimbledon
and
Kingston
,
was
composed
of
a
few
battalions
of
Volunteers
,
detachments
of
Metropolitan
police
,
Berks
and
Bucks
constabulary
,
London
firemen
and
postmen
,
the
Corps
of
Commissionaires
--
in
fact
,
every
body
of
drilled
men
who
could
be
requisitioned
to
handle
revolver
or
rifle
.
<EOS>
These
were
backed
by
great
bodies
of
civilians
,
and
behind
stood
the
barricades
with
their
insignificant
-
looking
but
terribly
deadly
machine
guns
.
 
<EOS>
The
railways
had
,
on
the
first
news
of
the
enemy
's
success
at
Leatherhead
and
Guildford
,
all
been
cut
up
,
and
in
each
of
the
many
bridges
spanning
the
Thames
between
Kingston
and
the
Tower
great
charges
of
gun
-
cotton
had
been
placed
,
so
that
they
might
be
blown
up
at
any
instant
,
and
thus
prevent
the
enemy
from
investing
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
Day
dawned
again
at
last
--
dull
and
grey
.
<EOS>
It
had
rained
during
the
night
,
and
the
roads
,
wet
and
muddy
,
were
unutterably
gloomy
as
our
civilian
defenders
looked
out
upon
them
,
well
knowing
that
ere
long
<EOS>
a
fierce
attack
would
be
made
.
<EOS>
In
the
night
the
enemy
had
been
busy
laying
a
field
telegraph
from
Mitcham
to
Kingston
,
through
which
messages
were
now
being
continually
flashed
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
just
as
the
British
outposts
were
being
relieved
,
the
French
commenced
a
vigorous
attack
,
and
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
fighting
extended
along
the
whole
line
.
<EOS>
Volunteers
,
firemen
,
policemen
,
Commissionaires
,
and
civilians
all
fought
bravely
,
trusting
to
one
hope
,
namely
,
that
before
they
were
defeated
the
enemy
would
be
outflanked
and
attacked
in
their
rear
by
a
British
force
from
the
Surrey
Hills
.
<EOS>
They
well
knew
that
to
effectually
bar
the
advance
of
this
great
body
of
French
<EOS>
was
out
of
all
question
,
yet
they
fought
on
with
creditable
tact
,
and
in
many
instances
inflicted
serious
loss
upon
the
enemy
's
infantry
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
,
however
,
French
field
guns
were
trained
upon
them
,
and
amid
the
roar
of
artillery
line
after
line
of
heroic
Britons
fell
shattered
to
earth
.
<EOS>
Amid
the
rattle
of
musketry
,
the
crackling
of
the
machine
guns
,
and
the
booming
of
16-pounders
,
brave
Londoners
struggled
valiantly
against
the
masses
of
wildly
excited
Frenchmen
;
yet
every
moment
the
line
became
slowly
weakened
,
and
the
defenders
were
gradually
forced
back
upon
their
barricades
.
<EOS>
The
resistance
which
the
French
met
with
was
much
more
determined
than
they
had
anticipated
;
in
fact
,
a
small
force
of
Volunteers
holding
the
Mitcham
Road
,
at
Streatham
,
fought
with
such
splendid
bravery
,
that
they
succeeded
alone
and
unaided
in
completely
wiping
out
a
battalion
of
French
infantry
,
and
capturing
two
field
guns
and
a
quantity
of
ammunition
.
<EOS>
For
this
success
,
however
,
they
,
alas
!
<EOS>
paid
dearly
,
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
a
large
body
of
cavalry
and
infantry
coming
over
from
Woodlands
descended
upon
them
and
totally
annihilated
them
,
with
the
result
that
Streatham
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
French
,
and
a
few
guns
placed
in
the
high
road
soon
made
short
work
of
the
earthworks
near
the
hospital
.
<EOS>
Under
the
thick
hail
of
bursting
shells
<EOS>
the
brave
band
who
manned
the
guns
were
at
last
compelled
to
abandon
them
,
and
the
enemy
were
soon
marching
unchecked
into
Stockwell
and
Brixton
,
extending
their
right
,
with
the
majority
of
their
artillery
,
across
Herne
Hill
,
Dulwich
,
and
Honor
Oak
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
a
desperate
battle
was
being
fought
around
Kingston
.
<EOS>
The
barricade
on
Kingston
Hill
held
out
for
nearly
three
hours
,
but
was
at
last
captured
by
the
invaders
,
and
of
those
who
had
manned
it
not
a
man
survived
.
<EOS>
Mitcham
and
Tooting
had
fallen
in
the
first
hour
of
the
engagement
,
the
barricade
at
Lynwood
had
been
taken
,
and
hundreds
of
the
houses
in
Balham
had
been
looted
by
the
enemy
in
their
advance
into
Clapham
.
 
<EOS>
Nearly
the
whole
morning
it
rained
in
torrents
,
and
both
invaders
and
defenders
were
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
covered
with
blood
and
mud
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
British
pluck
showed
itself
in
this
desperate
resistance
on
the
part
of
these
partially
-
trained
defenders
.
<EOS>
At
the
smaller
barricades
in
the
suburban
jerry
-
built
streets
,
Britons
held
their
own
and
checked
the
advance
with
remarkable
coolness
;
yet
,
as
the
dark
,
stormy
day
wore
on
,
the
street
defences
were
one
after
another
broken
down
and
destroyed
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
by
three
o'clock
that
afternoon
the
enemy
ran
riot
through
the
whole
district
,
from
Lower
Sydenham
to
Kingston
.
<EOS>
Around
the
larger
houses
on
Sydenham
Hill
one
of
the
fiercest
fights
occurred
,
but
at
length
the
defenders
were
driven
down
into
Lordship
Lane
,
and
the
houses
on
the
hill
were
sacked
,
and
some
of
them
burned
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
proceeding
,
a
great
force
of
French
artillery
came
over
from
Streatham
,
and
before
dusk
five
great
batteries
had
been
established
along
the
Parade
in
front
of
the
Crystal
Palace
,
and
on
Sydenham
Hill
and
One
Tree
Hill
;
while
other
smaller
batteries
were
brought
into
position
at
Forest
Hill
,
Gipsy
Hill
,
Tulse
Hill
,
Streatham
Hill
,
and
Herne
Hill
;
and
further
towards
London
about
twenty
French
12-pounders
and
a
number
of
new
quick
-
firing
weapons
of
long
range
and
a
very
destructive
character
were
placed
along
the
top
of
Camberwell
Grove
and
Denmark
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
defences
of
London
had
been
broken
.
<EOS>
The
track
of
the
invaders
was
marked
by
ruined
homes
and
heaps
of
corpses
,
and
London
's
millions
knew
on
this
eventful
night
that
the
enemy
were
now
actually
at
their
doors
.
<EOS>
In
Fleet
Street
,
in
the
Strand
,
in
Piccadilly
,
the
news
spread
from
mouth
to
mouth
as
darkness
fell
that
the
enemy
were
preparing
to
launch
their
deadly
shells
into
the
City
.
<EOS>
This
increased
the
panic
.
<EOS>
The
people
were
in
a
mad
frenzy
of
excitement
,
and
the
scenes
everywhere
were
terrible
.
<EOS>
Women
wept
and
wailed
,
men
uttered
words
of
blank
despair
,
and
children
screamed
at
an
unknown
terror
.
 
<EOS>
The
situation
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
From
the
Embankment
away
on
the
Surrey
side
could
be
seen
a
lurid
glare
in
the
sky
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
reflection
of
a
great
fire
in
Vassall
Road
,
Brixton
,
the
whole
street
being
burned
by
the
enemy
,
together
with
the
great
block
of
houses
lying
between
the
Cowley
and
Brixton
Roads
.
 
<EOS>
London
waited
.
<EOS>
Dark
storm
-
clouds
scudded
across
the
moon
.
<EOS>
The
chill
wind
swept
up
the
river
,
and
moaned
mournfully
in
doors
and
chimneys
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
without
warning
,
just
as
Big
Ben
had
boomed
forth
one
o'clock
,
the
thunder
of
artillery
shook
the
windows
,
and
startled
the
excited
crowds
.
<EOS>
Great
shells
crashed
into
the
streets
,
remained
for
a
second
,
and
then
burst
with
deafening
report
and
appalling
effect
.
 
<EOS>
In
Trafalgar
Square
,
Fleet
Street
,
and
the
Strand
the
deadly
projectiles
commenced
to
fall
thickly
,
wrecking
the
shops
,
playing
havoc
with
the
public
buildings
,
and
sweeping
hundreds
of
men
and
women
into
eternity
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
withstand
their
awful
force
,
and
the
people
,
rushing
madly
about
like
frightened
sheep
,
felt
that
this
was
indeed
their
last
hour
.
 
<EOS>
In
Ludgate
Hill
the
scene
was
awful
.
<EOS>
Shots
fell
with
monotonous
regularity
,
bursting
everywhere
,
and
blowing
buildings
and
men
into
atoms
.
<EOS>
The
French
shells
were
terribly
devastating
;
the
reek
of
melinite
poisoned
the
air
.
<EOS>
Shells
striking
St.
Paul
's
Cathedral
brought
down
the
right
-
hand
tower
,
and
crashed
into
the
dome
;
while
others
set
on
fire
a
long
range
of
huge
drapery
warehouses
behind
it
,
the
glare
of
the
roaring
flames
causing
the
great
black
Cathedral
to
stand
out
in
bold
relief
.
 
<EOS>
The
bombardment
had
actually
commenced
!
<EOS>
London
,
the
proud
Capital
of
the
World
,
was
threatened
with
destruction

CHAPTER
XXXV
.
 
<EOS>
LONDON
BOMBARDED
.
  
<EOS>
The
Hand
of
the
Destroyer
had
reached
England
's
mighty
metropolis
.
<EOS>
The
lurid
scene
was
appalling
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
stormy
sky
the
red
glare
from
hundreds
of
burning
buildings
grew
brighter
,
and
in
every
quarter
flames
leaped
up
and
black
smoke
curled
slowly
away
in
increasing
volume
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
were
unaware
of
the
events
that
had
occurred
in
Surrey
that
day
.
<EOS>
Exhausted
,
emaciated
,
and
ashen
pale
,
the
hungry
people
had
endured
every
torture
.
<EOS>
Panic
-
stricken
,
they
rushed
hither
and
thither
in
thousands
up
and
down
the
principal
thoroughfares
,
and
as
they
tore
headlong
away
in
this
_
sauve
qui
peut
_
to
the
northern
suburbs
,
the
weaker
fell
and
were
trodden
under
foot
.
 
<EOS>
Men
fought
for
their
wives
and
families
,
dragging
them
away
out
of
the
range
of
the
enemy
's
fire
,
which
apparently
did
not
extend
beyond
the
line
formed
by
the
Hackney
Road
,
City
Road
,
Pentonville
Road
,
Euston
Road
,
and
Westbourne
Park
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
terrible
rush
to
escape
many
delicate
ladies
were
crushed
to
death
,
and
numbers
of
others
,
with
their
children
,
sank
exhausted
,
and
perished
beneath
the
feet
of
the
fleeing
millions
.
 
<EOS>
Never
before
had
such
alarm
been
spread
through
London
;
never
before
had
such
awful
scenes
of
destruction
been
witnessed
.
<EOS>
The
French
Commander
-
in
-
chief
,
who
was
senior
to
his
Russian
colleague
,
had
been
killed
,
and
his
successor
being
unwilling
to
act
in
concert
with
the
Muscovite
staff
,
a
quarrel
ensued
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
quarrel
which
caused
the
bombardment
of
London
,
totally
against
the
instructions
of
their
respective
Governments
.
<EOS>
The
bombardment
was
,
in
fact
,
wholly
unnecessary
,
and
was
in
a
great
measure
due
to
some
confused
orders
received
by
the
French
General
from
his
Commander
-
in
-
chief
.
<EOS>
Into
the
midst
of
the
surging
,
terrified
crowds
that
congested
the
streets
on
each
side
of
the
Thames
,
shells
filled
with
melinite
dropped
,
and
,
bursting
,
blew
hundreds
of
despairing
Londoners
to
atoms
.
<EOS>
Houses
were
shattered
and
fell
,
public
buildings
were
demolished
,
factories
were
set
alight
,
and
the
powerful
exploding
projectiles
caused
the
Great
City
to
reel
and
quake
.
<EOS>
Above
the
constant
crash
of
bursting
shells
,
the
dull
roar
of
the
flames
,
and
the
crackling
of
burning
timbers
,
terrific
detonations
now
and
then
were
heard
,
as
buildings
,
filled
with
combustibles
,
were
struck
by
shots
,
and
,
exploding
,
spread
death
and
ruin
over
wide
areas
.
<EOS>
The
centre
of
commerce
,
of
wealth
,
of
intellectual
and
moral
life
was
being
ruthlessly
wrecked
,
and
its
inhabitants
massacred
.
<EOS>
Apparently
it
was
not
the
intention
of
the
enemy
to
invest
the
city
at
present
,
fearing
perhaps
that
the
force
that
had
penetrated
the
defences
was
not
sufficiently
large
to
accomplish
such
a
gigantic
task
;
therefore
they
had
commenced
this
terrible
bombardment
as
a
preliminary
measure
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
streets
of
South
London
the
people
rushed
along
,
all
footsteps
being
bent
towards
the
bridges
;
but
on
every
one
of
them
the
crush
was
frightful
--
indeed
,
so
great
was
it
that
in
several
instances
the
stone
balustrades
were
broken
,
and
many
helpless
,
shrieking
persons
were
forced
over
into
the
dark
swirling
waters
below
.
<EOS>
The
booming
of
the
batteries
was
continuous
,
the
bursting
of
the
shells
was
deafening
,
and
every
moment
was
one
of
increasing
horror
.
<EOS>
Men
saw
their
homes
swept
away
,
and
trembling
women
clung
to
their
husbands
,
speechless
with
fear
.
<EOS>
In
the
City
,
in
the
Strand
,
in
Westminster
,
and
West
End
streets
the
ruin
was
even
greater
,
and
the
destruction
of
property
enormous
.
 
<EOS>
Westward
,
both
great
stations
at
Victoria
,
with
the
adjoining
furniture
repositories
and
the
Grosvenor
Hotel
,
were
burning
fiercely
;
while
the
Wellington
Barracks
had
been
partially
demolished
,
and
the
roof
of
St.
Peter
's
Church
blown
away
.
<EOS>
Two
shells
falling
in
the
quadrangle
of
Buckingham
Palace
had
smashed
every
window
and
wrecked
some
of
the
ground
-
floor
apartments
,
but
nevertheless
upon
the
flagstaff
,
amidst
the
dense
smoke
and
showers
of
sparks
flying
upward
,
there
still
floated
the
Royal
Standard
.
<EOS>
St.
James
's
Palace
,
Marlborough
House
,
Stafford
House
,
and
Clarence
House
,
standing
in
exposed
positions
,
were
being
all
more
or
less
damaged
;
several
houses
in
Carlton
House
Terrace
had
been
partially
demolished
,
and
a
shell
striking
the
Duke
of
York
's
Column
soon
after
the
commencement
of
the
bombardment
,
caused
it
to
fall
,
blocking
Waterloo
Place
.
 
<EOS>
Time
after
time
shells
whistled
above
and
fell
with
a
crash
and
explosion
,
some
in
the
centre
of
the
road
,
tearing
up
the
paving
,
and
others
striking
the
clubs
in
Pall
Mall
,
blowing
out
many
of
those
noble
time
-
mellowed
walls
.
<EOS>
The
portico
of
the
Athenaeum
had
been
torn
away
like
pasteboard
,
the
rear
premises
of
the
War
Office
had
been
pulverised
,
and
the
Carlton
,
Reform
,
and
United
Service
Clubs
suffered
terrible
damage
.
<EOS>
Two
shells
striking
the
Junior
Carlton
crashed
through
the
roof
,
and
exploding
almost
simultaneously
,
brought
down
an
enormous
heap
of
masonry
,
which
fell
across
the
roadway
,
making
an
effectual
barricade
;
while
at
the
same
moment
shells
began
to
fall
thickly
in
Grosvenor
Place
and
Belgrave
Square
,
igniting
many
houses
,
and
killing
some
of
those
who
remained
in
their
homes
petrified
by
fear
.
 
<EOS>
Up
Regent
Street
shells
were
sweeping
with
frightful
effect
.
<EOS>
The
Cafe
Monico
and
the
whole
block
of
buildings
surrounding
it
was
burning
,
and
the
flames
leaping
high
,
presented
a
magnificent
though
appalling
spectacle
.
<EOS>
The
front
of
the
London
Pavilion
had
been
partially
blown
away
,
and
of
the
two
uniform
rows
of
shops
forming
the
Quadrant
many
had
been
wrecked
.
<EOS>
From
Air
Street
to
Oxford
Circus
,
and
along
Piccadilly
to
Knightsbridge
,
there
fell
a
perfect
hail
of
shell
and
bullets
.
<EOS>
Devonshire
House
had
been
wrecked
,
and
the
Burlington
Arcade
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
thin
pointed
spire
of
St.
James
's
Church
had
fallen
,
every
window
in
the
Albany
was
shattered
,
several
houses
in
Grosvenor
Place
had
suffered
considerably
,
and
a
shell
that
struck
the
southern
side
of
St.
George
's
Hospital
had
ignited
it
,
and
now
at
2
A.M.
,
in
the
midst
of
this
awful
scene
of
destruction
and
disaster
,
the
helpless
sick
were
being
removed
into
the
open
streets
,
where
bullets
whistled
about
them
and
fragments
of
explosive
shells
whizzed
past
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
night
wore
on
London
trembled
and
fell
.
<EOS>
Once
Mistress
of
the
World
,
she
was
now
,
alas
!
<EOS>
sinking
under
the
iron
hand
of
the
invader
.
<EOS>
Upon
her
there
poured
a
rain
of
deadly
missiles
that
caused
appalling
slaughter
and
desolation
.
<EOS>
The
newly
introduced
long
-
range
guns
,
and
the
terrific
power
of
the
explosives
with
which
the
French
shells
were
charged
,
added
to
the
horrors
of
the
bombardment
;
for
although
the
batteries
were
so
far
away
as
to
be
out
of
sight
,
yet
the
unfortunate
people
,
overtaken
by
their
doom
,
were
torn
limb
from
limb
by
the
bursting
bombs
.
 
<EOS>
Over
the
roads
lay
men
of
London
,
poor
and
rich
,
weltering
in
their
blood
,
their
lower
limbs
shattered
or
blown
completely
away
.
<EOS>
With
wide
-
open
haggard
eyes
,
in
their
death
agony
they
gazed
around
at
the
burning
buildings
,
at
the
falling
debris
,
and
upward
at
the
brilliantly
-
illumined
sky
.
<EOS>
With
their
last
breath
they
gasped
prayers
for
those
they
loved
,
and
sank
to
the
grave
,
hapless
victims
of
Babylon
's
downfall
.
 
<EOS>
Every
moment
the
Great
City
was
being
devastated
,
every
moment
the
catastrophe
was
more
complete
,
more
awful
.
<EOS>
In
the
poorer
quarters
of
South
London
whole
streets
were
swept
away
,
and
families
overwhelmed
by
their
own
demolished
homes
.
<EOS>
Along
the
principal
thoroughfares
shop
fronts
were
shivered
,
and
the
goods
displayed
in
the
windows
strewn
about
the
roadway
.
 
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
three
a
frightful
disaster
occurred
at
Battersea
.
<EOS>
Very
few
shells
had
dropped
in
that
district
,
when
suddenly
one
fell
right
in
the
very
centre
of
a
great
petroleum
store
.
<EOS>
The
effect
was
frightful
.
<EOS>
With
a
noise
that
was
heard
for
twenty
miles
around
,
the
whole
of
the
great
store
of
oil
exploded
,
blowing
the
stores
themselves
high
into
the
air
,
and
levelling
all
the
buildings
in
the
vicinity
.
<EOS>
In
every
direction
burning
oil
was
projected
over
the
roofs
of
neighbouring
houses
,
dozens
of
which
at
once
caught
fire
,
while
down
the
streets
there
ran
great
streams
of
blazing
oil
,
which
spread
the
conflagration
in
every
direction
.
<EOS>
Showers
of
sparks
flew
upwards
,
the
flames
roared
and
crackled
,
and
soon
fires
were
breaking
out
in
all
quarters
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
the
clocks
were
striking
a
quarter
to
four
,
a
great
shell
struck
the
Victoria
Tower
of
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
bringing
it
down
with
a
terrific
crash
.
<EOS>
This
disaster
was
quickly
followed
by
a
series
of
others
.
<EOS>
A
shell
fell
through
the
roof
of
Westminster
Abbey
,
setting
the
grand
old
historic
building
on
fire
;
another
tore
away
the
columns
from
the
front
of
the
Royal
Exchange
;
and
a
third
carried
away
one
of
the
square
twin
towers
of
St.
Mary
Woolnoth
,
at
the
corner
of
Lombard
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Along
this
latter
thoroughfare
banks
were
wrecked
,
and
offices
set
on
fire
;
while
opposite
,
in
the
thick
walls
of
the
Bank
of
England
,
great
breaches
were
being
made
.
<EOS>
The
Mansion
House
escaped
any
very
serious
injury
,
but
the
dome
of
the
Stock
Exchange
was
carried
away
;
and
in
Queen
Victoria
Street
,
from
end
to
end
,
enormous
damage
was
caused
to
the
rows
of
fine
business
premises
;
while
further
east
the
Monument
,
broken
in
half
,
came
down
with
a
noise
like
thunder
,
demolishing
many
houses
on
Fish
Street
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
drapery
warehouses
in
Wood
Street
,
Bread
Street
,
Friday
Street
,
Foster
Lane
,
and
St.
Paul
's
Churchyard
suffered
more
or
less
.
<EOS>
Ryland
's
,
Morley
's
,
and
Cook
's
were
all
alight
and
burning
fiercely
;
while
others
were
wrecked
and
shattered
,
and
their
contents
blown
out
into
the
streets
.
<EOS>
The
quaint
spire
of
St.
Bride
's
had
fallen
,
and
its
bells
lay
among
the
debris
in
the
adjoining
courts
;
both
the
half
-
wrecked
offices
of
the
_
Daily
Telegraph
_
and
the
_
Daily
Chronicle
_
were
being
consumed
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
clock
-
tower
of
the
Law
Courts
fell
about
four
o'clock
with
a
terrific
crash
,
completely
blocking
the
Strand
at
Temple
Bar
,
and
demolishing
the
much
-
abused
Griffin
Memorial
;
while
at
the
same
moment
two
large
holes
were
torn
in
the
roof
of
the
Great
Hall
,
the
small
black
turret
above
fell
,
and
the
whole
of
the
glass
in
the
building
was
shivered
into
fragments
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
amazing
how
widespread
was
the
ruin
caused
by
each
of
the
explosive
missiles
.
<EOS>
Considering
the
number
of
guns
employed
by
the
French
in
this
cruel
and
wanton
destruction
of
property
,
the
desolation
they
were
causing
was
enormous
.
<EOS>
This
was
owing
to
the
rapid
extension
of
their
batteries
over
the
high
ground
from
One
Tree
Hill
through
Peckham
to
Greenwich
,
and
more
especially
to
the
wide
ranges
of
their
guns
and
the
terrific
power
of
their
shells
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
the
ordinary
projectiles
filled
with
melinite
,
charges
of
that
extremely
powerful
substance
lignine
dynamite
were
hurled
into
the
city
,
and
,
exploded
by
a
detonator
,
swept
away
whole
streets
,
and
laid
many
great
public
buildings
in
ruins
;
while
steel
shells
,
filled
with
some
arrangement
of
liquid
oxygen
and
blasting
gelatine
,
produced
frightful
effects
,
for
nothing
could
withstand
them
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
these
,
discharged
from
the
battery
on
Denmark
Hill
,
fell
in
the
quadrangle
behind
Burlington
House
,
and
levelled
the
Royal
Academy
and
the
surrounding
buildings
.
<EOS>
Again
a
terrific
explosion
sounded
,
and
as
the
smoke
cleared
it
was
seen
that
a
gelatine
shell
had
fallen
among
the
many
turrets
of
the
Natural
History
Museum
,
and
the
front
of
the
building
fell
out
with
a
deafening
crash
,
completely
blocking
the
Cromwell
Road
.
 
<EOS>
London
lay
at
the
mercy
of
the
invaders
.
<EOS>
So
swiftly
had
the
enemy
cut
their
way
through
the
defences
and
opened
their
hail
of
destroying
missiles
,
that
the
excited
,
starving
populace
were
unaware
of
what
had
occurred
until
dynamite
began
to
rain
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Newspapers
had
ceased
to
appear
;
and
although
telegraphic
communication
was
kept
up
with
the
defenders
on
the
Surrey
Hills
by
the
War
Office
,
yet
no
details
of
the
events
occurring
there
had
been
made
public
for
fear
of
spies
.
<EOS>
Londoners
had
remained
in
ignorance
,
and
,
alas
!
<EOS>
had
awaited
their
doom
.
<EOS>
Through
the
long
sultry
night
the
situation
was
one
of
indescribable
panic
and
disaster
.
 
<EOS>
The
sky
had
grown
a
brighter
red
,
and
the
streets
within
the
range
of
the
enemy
's
guns
,
now
deserted
,
were
in
most
cases
blocked
by
burning
ruins
and
fallen
telegraph
wires
;
while
about
the
roadways
lay
the
shattered
corpses
of
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
upon
whom
the
shells
had
wrought
their
frightful
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
bodies
,
mutilated
,
torn
limb
from
limb
,
were
sickening
to
gaze
upon

BABYLON

<EOS>
Dynamite
had
shattered
Charing
Cross
Station
and
the
Hotel
,
for
its
smoke
-
begrimed
facade
had
been
torn
out
,
and
the
station
yard
was
filled
with
a
huge
pile
of
smouldering
debris
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
of
the
Strand
from
Villiers
Street
to
Temple
Bar
scarcely
a
window
had
been
left
intact
,
and
the
roadway
itself
was
quite
impassable
,
for
dozens
of
buildings
had
been
overthrown
by
shells
,
and
what
in
many
cases
had
been
handsome
shops
were
now
heaps
of
bricks
,
slates
,
furniture
,
and
twisted
girders

The
rain
of
fire
continued
.
<EOS>
Dense
black
smoke
rising
in
a
huge
column
from
St.
Martin
's
Church
showed
plainly
what
was
the
fate
of
that
noble
edifice
,
while
fire
had
now
broken
out
at
the
Tivoli
Music
Hall
,
and
the
clubs
on
Adelphi
Terrace
were
also
falling
a
prey
to
the
flames
.
 
<EOS>
The
burning
of
Babylon
was
a
sight
of
awful
,
appalling
grandeur
.
 
<EOS>
The
few
people
remaining
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Strand
who
escaped
the
flying
missiles
and
falling
buildings
,
sought
what
shelter
they
could
,
and
stood
petrified
by
terror
,
knowing
that
every
moment
might
be
their
last
,
not
daring
to
fly
into
the
streets
leading
to
Holborn
,
where
they
could
see
the
enemy
's
shells
were
still
falling
with
unabated
regularity
and
frightful
result
,
their
courses
marked
by
crashing
buildings
and
blazing
ruins
.
 
<EOS>
Looking
from
Charing
Cross
,
the
Strand
seemed
one
huge
glaring
furnace
.
<EOS>
Flames
belched
from
windows
on
either
side
,
and
,
bursting
through
roofs
,
great
tongues
of
fire
shot
upwards
;
blazing
timbers
fell
into
the
street
;
and
as
the
buildings
became
gutted
,
and
the
fury
of
the
devouring
element
was
spent
,
shattered
walls
tottered
and
fell
into
the
roadway
.
<EOS>
The
terrific
heat
,
the
roar
of
the
flames
,
the
blinding
smoke
,
the
stifling
fumes
of
dynamite
,
the
pungent
,
poisonous
odour
of
melinite
,
the
clouds
of
dust
,
the
splinters
of
stone
and
steel
,
and
the
constant
bursting
of
shells
,
combined
to
render
the
scene
the
most
awful
ever
witnessed
in
a
single
thoroughfare
during
the
history
of
the
world
.

From
Kensington

from

from
Clapham

the
vast

of
congested

tortuous

was
being
swept
continually

South

the
loss

enormous

either
maimed
by
flying
fragments

burned
to

The

frightful

London

the

egotistically
considered
herself
the
impregnable
Citadel

fell
to

She

frozen
by

Her

swept
away

her

in

her

Along

where
the
French

were
established

the
deafening

had
smashed
nearly
all
the

Tulse

One

all

unable

<EOS>
Neither
of
the
ammunition
trains
of
the
two
columns
of
the
enemy
had
arrived
,
for
,
although
the
bombarding
batteries
were
unaware
of
it
,
both
had
been
captured
and
blown
up
by
British
Volunteers
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
this
that
the
hostile
guns
were
at
last
compelled
to
cease
their
thunder
,
and
to
this
fact
also
was
due
the
fortunes
of
the
defenders
in
the
events
immediately
following
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Volunteers
occupying
the
line
of
defence
north
of
London
,
through
Epping
and
Brentwood
to
Tilbury
,
had
for
the
past
three
weeks
been
in
daily
expectation
of
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
the
invaders
to
land
in
Essex
,
and
were
amazed
at
witnessing
this
sudden
bombardment
.
<EOS>
From
their
positions
on
the
northern
heights
they
could
distinctly
see
how
disastrous
was
the
enemy
's
fire
,
and
although
they
had
been
informed
by
telegraph
of
the
reverses
we
had
sustained
at
Guildford
and
Leatherhead
,
yet
they
had
no
idea
that
the
actual
attack
on
the
metropolis
would
be
made
so
swiftly
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
lost
not
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
evident
that
the
enemy
had
no
intention
of
effecting
a
landing
in
Essex
;
therefore
,
with
commendable
promptitude
,
they
decided
to
move
across
the
Thames
immediately
,
to
reinforce
their
comrades
in
Surrey

Paddington

Kensington

thence
to

force

our
Regular

cavalry

who
were
on
their
way
to
outflank
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
Attacking
a
detachment
of

Tooting
,
they
captured
several
guns
,
destroyed
the
enemy
's
field
telegraph
,
and
proceeded
at
once
to
Streatham
,
where
the
most
desperate
resistance
was
offered
.
<EOS>
A
fierce
fight
occurred
across
Streatham
Common
,
and
over
to
Lower
Norwood
and
Gipsy
Hill
,
in
which
both
sides
lost
very
heavily

<EOS>
Nevertheless
our
Volunteers
from
Essex
,
although
they
had
been
on
the
march
the
greater
part
of
the
night
,
fought
bravely
,
and
inflicted
terrible
punishment
upon

foe

<EOS>
The
3rd

4th
Volunteer
Battalions
of
the
Gordon
Highlanders
and
the
1st
Norfolk
,
attacking
a
French
position
near
the
mouth
of
the
railway
tunnel
,
displayed
conspicuous
bravery
,
and
succeeded
in
completely
annihilating
their
opponents
;
while
in
an
opposite
direction
,
towards
Tooting
,
several
troops
of
French
cavalry
were
cut
up
and
taken
prisoners
by
two
battalions
of
Royal
Highlanders
.
 
<EOS>
The
batteries
on
Streatham
Hill
having
been
assaulted
and
taken
,
the
force
of
defenders
pushed
quickly
onward
to
Upper
Norwood
,
where
our
cavalry
,
sweeping
along
Westow
Hill
and
Church
Street
,
fell
upon
the
battery
in
front
of
the
Crystal
Palace
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
,
owing
to
the
interruption
of
their
field
telegraph
,
were
unaware
of
their
presence
,
and
were
completely
surprised
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
French
infantrymen
rushed
into
the
Crystal
Palace
Hotel
,
the
White
Swan
,
Stanton
Harcourt
,
the
Knoll
,
Rocklands
,
and
other
houses
at
both
ends
of
the
Parade
,
and
from
the
windows
poured
forth
withering
volleys
from
their
Lebels
.
<EOS>
Our
cavalry
,
riding
down
the
broad
Parade
,
used
their
sabres
upon
the
artillerymen
,
and
the
whole
of
the
French
troops
were
quickly
in
a
confused
mass
,
unable
to
act
with
effect
,
and
suffering
appallingly
from
the
steady
fire
of
our
Volunteers
,
who
very
soon
cleared
the
enemy
from
the
White
Swan
,
and
,
having
been
drawn
up
outside
,
poured
forth
a
galling
rifle
fire
right
along
the
enemy
's
position
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
was
loud
shouting
,
and
the
British
"
Cease
fire
"
sounded
.
<EOS>
The
French
,
though
fighting
hard
,
were
falling
back
gradually
down
the
hill
towards
Sydenham
Station
,
when
suddenly
shots
were
heard
,
and
turbaned
cavalry
came
riding
into
them
at
a
terrific
pace
from
the
rear
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
officers
recognised
the
new
-
comers
as
a
squadron
of
Bengal
Lancers
!
<EOS>
At
last
India
had
sent
us
help
,
and
our
men
sent
up
a
loud
cheer
.
<EOS>
A
large
force
of
cavalry
and
infantry
,
together
with
two
regiments
of
Goorkas
,
had
,
it
appeared
,
been
landed
at
Sheerness
.
<EOS>
They
had
contemplated
landing
in
Hampshire
,
but
,
more
unfortunate
than
some
of
their
compatriots
who
had
effected
a
landing
near
Southampton
,
they
were
driven
through
the
Straits
of
Dover
by
the
enemy
's
cruisers
.
<EOS>
Marching
north
in
company
with
a
force
from
Chatham
,
they
had
earlier
that
morning
attacked
and
routed
the
enemy
's
right
flank
at
Blackheath
,
and
,
after
capturing
the
battery
of
the
foe
at
Greenwich
,
greater
part
of
the
escort
of
which
had
been
sent
over
to
Lewisham
an
hour
before
,
they
slaughtered
a
battalion
of
Zouaves
,
and
had
then
extended
across
to
Denmark
Hill
,
where
a
sanguinary
struggle
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
on
Dog
Kennel
,
Red
Post
,
Herne
,
and
Tulse
Hills
turned
their
deadly
machine
guns
upon
them
,
and
for
a
long
time
all
the
positions
held
out
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
by
reason
of
a
splendid
charge
made
by
the
Bengal
Lancers
,
the
battery
at
Red
Post
Hill
was
taken
and
the
enemy
slaughtered
.
<EOS>
During
the
next
half
-
hour
a
fierce
hand
-
to
-
hand
struggle
took
place
up
Dog
Kennel
Hill
from
St.
Saviour
's
Infirmary
,
and
presently
,
when
the
defenders
gained
the
spur
of
the
hill
,
they
fought
the
enemy
gallantly
in
Grove
Lane
,
Private
Road
,
Bromar
Road
,
Camberwell
Grove
,
and
adjoining
roads
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
the
Indian
cavalry
charged
,
and
the
Goorkas
,
with
their
keen
knives
,
hacked
their
way
into
those
of
the
enemy
who
rallied
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
an
hour
the
struggle
continued
desperately
,
showers
of
bullets
from
magazine
rifles
sweeping
along
the
usually
quiet
suburban
thoroughfares
,
until
the
roads
were
heaped
with
dead
and
dying
,
and
the
houses
on
either
side
bore
evidence
of
the
bloody
fray
.
<EOS>
Then
at
last
the
guns

In

Georgian
days

when

walked
daily
under

in

Square
,
when
Macklin
was
playing
the
"
Man
of

and
when
traitors

heads
blackened
on
Temple

this
colony
was
one
of
the
most
rural
,
exclusive
,
and
gay
in
the
vicinity
of
London
.
<EOS>
Alas

how
it
has
decayed

<EOS>
Cheap
"

have
sprung
up
around
it
,
the
hand
of
the

Vandal
has
touched
it
,
the
sound
of
traffic
roars
about
it
;
yet
still
there
is
a
charm
in
those
quaint
old
gardens
of
a
forgotten
era
.
<EOS>
From
under
the
dark
yew
hedges
the
jonquils
still
peep
out
early
--
the
flowers
themselves
are
those
old

and
<EOS>
the
tea
roses
still
blossom
on
the
crumbling
walls
and
fill
the
air
with
their
fragrance
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
terrible
struggle
the
walls
were
used
as
defences
,
the
bushes
were
torn
down
and
trampled
under
foot
,
and
the
flowers
hung
broken
on
their
stalks
,
bespattered
with
men

<EOS>
Proceeding
south
again
,
the

successfully
attacked
the
strong
batteries
on
One

at
Honor
Oak
,
and
on
Sydenham
Hill
and
Forest
Hill
,
and
then
extending
across

the
Crystal

,
had
joined
hands
with
our
Volunteers
from
Essex
,
where
they
were
now
wreaking
vengeance
for
the
ruthless
destruction
caused
in
London

The
bloodshed
along
the
Crystal

was
fearful
.

The
French

,
overwhelmed

that

that
had
effected
that
terribly
effectual
bombardment
from
Sydenham

not
more

By
noon
many
of
the

on
Westow

and
private

on
College

and
Sydenham

had
been
wantonly
ignited
by
the
enemy
;
but
when
the
firing
ceased
some
hours
later
,
the
roads
were
heaped
with
the
corpses
of
those
whose
mission
it
had
been
to
destroy
London

Of
all
those
batteries
which
had
caused
such
frightful
desolation
and
loss
of
life
during
the
night
,
not
one
now
remained

<EOS>
The
two
French
columns
had
been
swiftly
wiped
out
of
existence
;
and
although
our
forces
had
suffered
very
considerably
,
they
nevertheless
were
able
to
go
south
to
Croydon
later
that
afternoon
,
in
order
to
take
part
in
resisting
the
vigorous
and
desperate
attack
which
they

sooner

later
be
made
by
the
whole
French

massed
beyond
the
Surrey

The

Assistance

arrived
tardily
,
for
the

during
the
night
had
been
enormous
;
nevertheless
at
this
the
eleventh
hour
we
had
inflicted
upon

a
crushing

now
England
waited

trembling

FIGHTING
ON
THE
SURREY
HILLS

<EOS>
Our
valiant
defenders
were
striking
swift
,
decisive
blows
for
England
's
honour
.
<EOS>
The
French
,
demoralised
by
their
severe
defeat
in
the
south
of
London
,
and
suffering
considerable
loss
in
every
other
direction
,
fought
desperately
during
the
two
days
following
the
disastrous
bombardment
.
 
<EOS>
In
darkness
and
sunlight
fierce
contests
took
place
along
the
Surrey
Hills
,
where
our
Volunteers
,
under
Major
-
Gen
.
<EOS>
Lord
Methuen
,
were
still
entrenched
.
<EOS>
Every
copse
bristled
with
rifles
;
red
coats
gleamed
among
the
foliage
,
and
winding
highways
were
,
alas
!
<EOS>
strewn
with
corpses
.
<EOS>
Guildford
had
again
been
reoccupied
by
our
Regulars
,
who
were
reorganising
;
and
Leatherhead
,
holding
out
for
another
day
,
was
retaken
,
after
a
terribly
hard
-
fought
battle
,
by
the
Highland
,
South
of
Scotland
,
and
Glasgow
Brigades
,
with
the

Ayrshire

<EOS>
In
such
a
splendid
and
gallant
manner
had
our
comparatively
small
force
manoeuvred
,
that
on
the
second
night
following
the
bombardment
the
whole
of
the
invaders
who
had
penetrated
beyond
our
line
of
defence
towards
the
metropolis
had
been
completely
wiped
out
,
in
addition
to
which
the
breach
in
our
line
had
been
filled
up
by
strong
reinforcements
,
and
the
enemy
driven
from
the
high
ground
between
Box
Hill
and
Guildford
.
 
<EOS>
The
invaders
,
finding
how
vigorously
we
repelled
any
attack
,
made
terrific
onslaughts
on
our
position
at
various
points
they
believed
were
vulnerable
,
but
everywhere
they
were
hurled
back
with
appalling
slaughter
.
<EOS>
Volunteers
from
Australia
and
the
Cape
,
in
addition
to
the
other
contingent
of
10,000
Indian
native
troops
,
had
been
landed
near
Southampton
,
and
had
advanced
to
assist
in
this
terrific
struggle
,
upon
the
result
of
which
the
future
of
our
Empire
depended
.
<EOS>
Among
these
Colonials
were
500
Victorian
Rangers
,
900
Victoria
Mounted
Rifles
,
and
seven
companies
of
Queensland
Mounted
Infantry
,
with
two
ambulance
corps
.
 
<EOS>
The
Indians
landed
in
splendid
form
,
having
brought
their
full
war
equipment
with
them
without
any
contribution
<EOS>
whatever
from
the
Home
Government
,
as
it
will
be
remembered
they
did
when
they
landed
at
Malta
during
Lord
Beaconsfield
's
administration
.
<EOS>
Having
received
intelligence
of
the
movements
of
the
two
columns
of
the
enemy
that
had
gone
to
London
after
taking
Leatherhead
and
Guildford
,
they
pushed
on
to
Petworth
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
they
arrived
there
,
however
,
both
towns
had
been
recaptured
by
the
British
,
who
were
then
being
severely
harassed
by
the
enemy
massed
along
the
south
side
of
our
defensive
line
.
<EOS>
Although
numerically
inferior
to
the
enemy
occupying
that
part
of
the
country
,
the
Indians
were
already
well
accustomed
to
actual
warfare
,
the
majority
having
been
engaged
in
operations
against
the
hill
tribes
;
therefore
the
commander
decided
to
push
on
at
once
,
and
endeavour
to
outflank
the
large
French
force
who
with
some
Russian
infantry
had
again
attacked
Guildford
,
and
the
manner
in
which
this
was
accomplished
was
a
single
illustration
of
the
valuable
assistance
the
Indians
rendered
us
in
these
days
of
bloodshed
and
despair
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
native
officers
of
a
Sikh
regiment
,
the
Subadar
Banerji
Singh
,
having
served
with
Sir
Peter
Lumsden
's
expeditionary
force
some
years
before
,
had
frequently
come
into
contact
with
the
Russians
,
and
could
speak
Russian
better
than
some
of
the
soldiers
of
the
Tsar
's
Asiatic
corps
.
<EOS>
The
commander
of
the
Indian
force
,
determined
that
his
men
should
strike
their
blow
and
sustain
their
reputation
,
advanced
with
great
caution
from
Petworth
,
and
late
in
the
afternoon
of
the
second
evening
after
the
bombardment
of
London
,
two
Sikhs
scouting
in
front
of
the
advance
guard
sighted
a
Russian
bivouac
on
the
road
on
the
other
side
of
the
Wye
Canal
beyond
Loxwood
Bridge
,
which
latter
had
been
demolished
.
<EOS>
The
Indians
were
thereupon
halted
on
the
road
which
runs
through
the
wood
near
Plaistow
,
and
the
officers
held
council
.
<EOS>
Their
information
was
unfortunately
very
meagre
and
their
knowledge
of
the
country
necessarily
vague
;
but
the
Subadar
Banerji
Singh
,
who
was
of
unusually
fair
complexion
,
volunteered
to
don
a
Russian
uniform
,
which
had
been
taken
with
other
property
from
a
dead
officer
found
upon
the
road
,
and
endeavour
in
that
disguise
to
penetrate
the
enemy
's
lines
.
 
<EOS>
Towards
dusk
he
set
out
on
his
perilous
journey
,
and
,
on
arriving
at
the
wrecked
bridge
,
shouted
over
to
two
Russian
sentries
,
explaining
that
he
had
been
wounded
and
left
behind
after
the
fight
at
Haslemere
,
and
requesting
their
assistance
to
enable
him
to
cross
.
<EOS>
Believing
him
to
be
one
of
their
infantry
officers
,
they
told
him
there
were
no
means
of
crossing
unless
he
could
swim
,
as
their
engineers
had
sounded
the
canal
before
blowing
up
the
bridge
,
and
had
found
it
twenty
feet
deep
.
 
<EOS>
Banerji
Singh
questioned
them
artfully
as
to
the
position
of
their
column
,
which
they
said
intended
,
in
co
-
operation
with
a
great
force
of
French
cavalry
and
infantry
,
to
again
attack
Guildford
at
dawn
;
and
further
,
they
told
him
in
confidence
that
the
rearguard
to
which
they
belonged
only
numbered
about
two
thousand
men
,
who
had
halted
for
the
night
with
the
transport
waggons
on
the
Guildford
road
,
about
two
miles
north
of
Alfold
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
after
further
confidences
,
they
suggested
that
he
should
continue
along
the
canal
bank
for
about
a
mile
and
a
half
,
where
there
was
a
bridge
still
intact
,
and
near
which
he
would
find
the
rearguard
.
 
<EOS>
Thanking
them
,
he
withdrew
into
the
falling
gloom
,
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
entered
the
presence
of
his
commanding
officer
,
who
,
of
course
,
was
delighted
with
the
information
thus
elicited
.
<EOS>
The
Subadar
had
carefully
noted
all
the
features
of
the
canal
bank
and
broken
bridge
,
and
the
valuable
knowledge
he
had
obtained
was
at
once
put
to
account
,
and
the
General
at
once
formed
his
force
into
two
divisions
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
issuing
instructions
for
the
following
day
,
he
gave
orders
for
a
bivouac
for
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
The
pioneers
,
however
,
were
far
from
idle
.
<EOS>
During
the
night
they
worked
with
unflagging
energy
,
quietly
preparing
a
position
for
the
guns
to
cover
the
contemplated
passage
at
Loxwood
Bridge
,
and
before
day
broke
the
guns
were
mounted
,
and
the
Engineers
were
ready
for
action
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
there
was
sufficient
light
the
laying
of
the
pontoon
commenced
,
but
was
at
once
noticed
by
the
Russians
,
who
opened
fire
,
and
very
soon
it
was
evident
that
information
had
been
conveyed
to
the
enemy
's
rearguard
,
and
that
they
were
returning
to
contest
the
passage
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
one
division
of
the
Indians
,
setting
out
before
daybreak
,
had
been
cautiously
working
round
to
the
main
road
crossing
the
canal
north
of
Alfold
,
and
succeeded
in
getting
over
soon
after
the
majority
of
the
Russian
rearguard
had
left
for
the
assistance
of
the
detachment
at
Loxwood
Bridge
,
and
,
after
a
sharp
,
decisive
fight
,
succeeded
in
capturing
the
whole
of
the
transport
waggons
.
<EOS>
The
Engineers
,
with
the
Indians
,
had
in
the
meantime
succeeded
in
completing
their
pontoon
under
cover
of
the
guns
,
and
the
second
division
of
the
Indians
,
dark
-
faced
,
daring
fellows
,
rushed
across
to
the
opposite
bank
,
and
descended
upon
the
enemy
with
frightful
effect
.
<EOS>
In
the
hot
engagement
that
followed
,
the
Russians
,
now
attacked
in
both
front
and
rear
,
were
totally
annihilated
,
and
thus
the
whole
of
the
reserve
ammunition
of
the
force
assaulting
Guildford
fell
into
our
hands
.
 
<EOS>
This
victory
on
the
enemy
's
left
flank
caused
the
tide
of
events
to
turn
in
our
favour
,
for
the
huge
Russian
and
French
columns
that
intended
to
again
carry
the
hills
from
Dorking
to
Guildford
were
hampered
by
want
of
ammunition
,
and
so
vigorously
did
our
Volunteers
along
the
hills
defend
the
repeated
attacks
,
that
the
invaders
were
again
driven
back
.
<EOS>
Then
,
as
they
drew
south
to
recover
themselves
,
they
were
attacked
on
their
left
by
a
large
body
of
our
Regulars
,
and
in
the
rear
by
the
Indians
and
Australians
.
<EOS>
Over
the
country
stretching
across
from
Cranley
through
Ewhurst
,
Ockley
,
Capel
,
and
Newdigate
to
Horley
,
the
fighting
spread
,
as
each
side
struggled
desperately
for
the
mastery
.
 
<EOS>
The
fate
of
England
,
nay
,
of
our
vast
British
Empire
,
was
in
the
hands
of
those
of
her
stalwart
sons
of
many
races
who
were
now
wielding
valiantly
the
rifle
and
the
sword
.

Through
that
blazing
September
day
,
while
the
people
of
London
wailed
among
the
ruins
of
their
homes
,
and
,
breathlessly
anxious

awaited
news

,
the
whole

East

the
southern

<EOS>
Following
the
desperate
struggle
off
Sardinia
,
in
which
Italy
had
rendered
us
such
valuable
help
,
our
Mediterranean
Squadron
attacked
the
French
Fleet
off
Cape
Tresforcas
,
on
the
coast
of
Morocco
,
and
after
a
terrific
battle
,
extending
over
two
days
,
defeated
them
with
heavy
loss
,
several
of
the
enemy
's
vessels
being
torpedoed
and
sunk
,
two
of
them
rammed
,
and
one
so
badly
damaged
that
her
captain
ran
her
ashore
on
Alboran
Island
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
hard
-
earned
victory
,
our
Squadron
passed
out
of
the
Mediterranean
,
and
,
returning
home
,
had
joined
hands
with
the
battered
remnant
of
our
Channel
Fleet
,
now
reinforced
by
several
vessels
recalled
from
foreign
stations
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
while
the
enemy
marched
upon
London
,
we
had
collected
our
naval
strength
on
the
south
coast
,
and
at
length
made
a
final
descent
upon
the
enemy
in
British
waters
.
<EOS>
The
British
vessels
that
passed
Beachy
Head
coming
up
Channel
on
the
night
of
the
bombardment
of
London
included
the

the

and
a

,
and

.
"
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
hour
that
our
vessels
were
passing
Beachy
Head
,
the
Coastguard
at
Sandwich
Battery
were
suddenly
alarmed
by
electric
signals
being
flashed
from
a
number
of
warships
that
were
slowly
passing
the
Gull
Stream
revolving
light
towards
the
Downs
.
<EOS>
The
sensation
these
lights
caused
among
the
Coastguard
and
Artillery
was
immediately
dispelled
when
it
was
discovered
that
the
warships
were
not
hostile
,
but
friendly
;
that
the
Kaiser
had
sent
a
German
Squadron
,
in
two
divisions
,
to
assist
us
,
and
that
these
vessels
were
on
their
way
to
unite
with
our
own
Fleet
.
<EOS>
The
first
division
,
it
was
ascertained
,
consisted
of
the
_
Baden
_
,
flying
the
flag
of
Vice
-
Admiral
Koester
;
the
_
Sachen
_
,
commanded
by
Prince
Henry
of
Prussia
;
the
_
Wuertemberg
_
,
and
the
_
Bayern_--all
of
7400
tons
,
and
each
carrying
18
guns
and
nearly
400
men
;
while
the
despatch
boat
_
Pfeil
_
,
<EOS>
the
new
dynamite
cruiser
_
Trier
_
,
and
a
number
of
torpedo
boats
,
accompanied
them
.
<EOS>
The
second
division
,
under
Rear
-
Admiral
von
Diederichs
on
board
the
_
Koenig
Wilhelm
_
,
consisted
of
the
_
Brandenburg
_
,
_
Kuerfurst
Friedrich
Wilhelm
_
,
and
_
Woerth
_
,
each
of
10,300
tons
,
and
carrying
32
guns
;
the
_
Deutschland
_
and
the
_
Friedrich
der
Grosse
_
,
with
the
despatch
vessel
_
Wacht
_
,
and
several
torpedo
gunboats
and
other
craft
.
 
<EOS>
Before
dawn
,
the
British
and
German
Fleets
united
near
South
Sand
Head
light
,
off
the
South
Foreland
,
and
it
was
decided
to
commence
the
attack
without
delay
.
<EOS>
Turning
west
again
,
the
British
ships
,
accompanied
by
those
of
the
Emperor
William
,
proceeded
slowly
down
Channel
in
search
of
the
enemy
,
which
they
were
informed
by
signal
had
been
sighted
by
the
Coastguard
at
East
Wear
,
near
Folkestone
,
earlier
in
the
night
.
<EOS>
Just
as
day
broke
,
however
,
when
the
defenders
were
opposite
Dymchurch
,
about
eight
miles
from
land
,
the
enemy
were
discovered
in
force
.
<EOS>
Apparently
the
French
and
Russian
Fleets
had
combined
,
and
were
preparing
for
a
final
descent
upon
Dover
,
or
an
assault
upon
the
Thames
defences
;
and
it
could
be
seen
that
,
with
both
forces
so
strong
,
the
fight
would
inevitably
be
one
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
Little
time
was
occupied
in
preliminaries
.
<EOS>
Soon
our
ships
were
within
range
in
fighting
formation
in
single
column
in
line
abreast
,
while
the
French
,
under
Admiral
le
Bourgeois
,
advanced
in
single
column
in
line
ahead
.
<EOS>
The
French
flagship
,
leading
,
was
within
2000
yards
of
the
British
line
,
and
had
not
disclosed
the
nature
of
her
attack
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
's
Admiral
had
signalled
to
the
ships
astern
of
him
to
follow
his
motions
together
,
as
nearly
as
possible
to
concentrate
their
guns
at
point
blank
,
right
ahead
,
and
to
pour
their
shot
on
the
instant
of
passing
our
ships
.
<EOS>
He
had
but
three
minutes
to
decide
upon
the
attack
,
and
as
he
apparently
elected
to
pierce
the
centre
of
our
line
,
the
British
had
no
time
to
counteract
him
.
<EOS>
The
French
Admiral
therefore
continued
his
course
,
and
as
he
passed
between
the
_
Camperdown
_
and
_
Blenheim
_
,
he
discharged
his
guns
,
receiving
the
British
broadsides
and
bow
fire
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
,
however
,
it
was
seen
that
the
French
attack
had
been
frustrated
,
and
as
dawn
spread
the
fighting
increased
,
and
the
lines
became
broken
.
<EOS>
The
ponderous
guns
of
the
battleships
thundered
,
and
ere
long
the
whole
of
the
great
naval
force
was
engaged
in
this
final
struggle
for
England
's
freedom
.
<EOS>
The
three
powerful
French
battleships
,
_
Jaureguiberry
_
,
_
Jemappes
_
,
and
_
Devastation
_
,
and
the
submarine
torpedo
boat
_
Gustave
Zede
_
,
fiercely
attacked
the
_
Brandenburg
_
and
the
_
Koenig
Wilhelm
_
;
while
the
_
Camperdown
_
,
_
Anson
_
,
_
Dreadnought
_
,
and
_
Warspite
_
fought
desperately
with
half
a
dozen
of
the
enemy
's
battleships
,
all
of
which
suffered
considerably
.
<EOS>
Our
torpedo
boats
,
darting
swiftly
hither
and
thither
,
performed
much
effective
service
,
and
many
smart
manoeuvres
were
carried
out
by
astute
officers
in
command
of
those
wasps
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
In
one
instance
a
torpedo
boat
,
which
had
designs
upon
a
Russian
ironclad
,
obtained
cover
by
sending
in
front
of
her
a
gunboat
which
emitted
an
immense
quantity
of
dense
smoke
.
<EOS>
This
of
course
obscured
from
view
the
torpedo
boat
under
the
gunboat
's
stern
,
and
those
on
board
the
Tsar
's
battleship
pounded
away
at
the
gunboat
,
unconscious
of
the
presence
of
the
dangerous
little
craft
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
gunboat
got
level
with
the
battleship
,
however
,
the
torpedo
boat
emerged
from
the
cloud
of
smoke
,
and
,
darting
along
,
ejected
its
Whitehead
with
such
precision
that
five
minutes
later
the
Russian
leviathan
sank
beneath
the
dark
green
waters
.
<EOS>
Almost
at
the
same
moment
,
the
new
German
dynamite
cruiser
destroyed
a
French
cruiser
,
and
a
fierce
and
sanguinary
encounter
took
place
between
the
_
Immortalite
_
and
the
_
Trehouart
_
.
<EOS>
The
former
's
pair
of
22-tonners
,
in
combination
with
her
ten
6-inch
guns
,
wrought
awful
havoc
on
board
the
French
vessel
;
nevertheless
,
from
the
turret
of
her
opponent
there
came
a
deadly
fire
which
spread
death
and
destruction
through
the
ship
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
the
Frenchman
swung
round
,
and
with
her
quick
-
firing
guns
shedding
a
deadly
storm
of
projectiles
,
came
full
upon
the
British
vessel
.
<EOS>
The
impact
and
the
angle
at
which
she
was
struck
was
not
,
however
,
sufficient
to
ram
her
,
consequently
the
two
vessels
became
entangled
,
and
amid
the
rain
of
bullets
the
Frenchmen
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
board
our
ship
.
<EOS>
A
few
who
managed
to
spring
upon
the
_
Immortalite
's
_
deck
were
cut
down
instantly
,
but
a
couple
of
hundred
fully
armed
men
were
preparing
to
make
a
rush
to
overpower
our
bluejackets
.
<EOS>
On
board
the
British
cruiser
,
however
,
the
enemy
's
intentions
had
been
divined
,
and
certain
precautions
taken
.
<EOS>
The
_
Fusiliers
Marins
_
,
armed
with
Lebels
and
cutlasses
,
suddenly
made
a
desperate
,
headlong
rush
upon
the
British
cruiser
's
deck
,
but
just
as
fifty
of
them
gained
their
goal
,
a
great
hose
attached
to
one
of
the
boilers
was
brought
into
play
,
and
scalding
water
poured
upon
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
This
,
in
addition
to
some
hand
charges
at
that
moment
thrown
,
proved
successful
in
repelling
the
attack
;
but
just
as
the
survivors
retreated
in
disorder
there
was
a
dull
explosion
,
and
then
it
was
evident
,
from
the
confusion
on
board
the
French
ship
,
that
she
had
been
torpedoed
by
a
German
boat
,
and
was
sinking
.
 
<EOS>
Humanely
,
our
vessel
,
the
_
Immortalite
_
rescued
the
whole
of
her
opponent
's
men
ere
<EOS>
she
sank
;
<EOS>
but
it
was
found
that
in
the
engagement
her
captain
and
half
her
crew
had
been
killed
.
<EOS>
On
every
hand
the
fight
continued
with
unabated
fierceness
;
every
gun
was
worked
to
its
utmost
capacity
,
and
amid
the
smoke
and
din
every
vessel
was
swept
from
stem
to
stern
.
<EOS>
As
morning
wore
on
,
the
enemy
met
with
one
or
two
successes
.
<EOS>
Our
two
new
cruisers
_
Terrible
_
and
_
<EOS>
Powerful
_
had
been
sunk
by
French
torpedoes
;
the
_
Hood
_
had
been
rammed
by
the
_
Amiral
Baudin
_
,
and
gone
to
the
bottom
with
nearly
every
soul
on
board
;
while
the
German
despatch
boat
_
Wacht
_
had
been
captured
,
and
seven
of
our
torpedo
boats
had
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
During
the
progress
of
the
fight
,
the
vessels
came
gradually
nearer
Dungeness
,
and
at
eleven
o'clock
they
were
still
firing
at
each
other
,
with
appalling
results
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
At
such
close
quarters
did
this
great
battle
occur
,
that
the
loss
of
life
was
awful
,
and
throughout
the
ships
the
destruction
was
widespread
and
frightful
.
<EOS>
About
noon
the
enemy
experienced
two
reverses
.
<EOS>
The
French
battleship
_
Formidable
_
blew
up
with
a
terrific
report
,
filling
the
air
with
debris
,
her
magazine
having
exploded
;
while
just
at
that
moment
the
_
Courbet
_
,
whose
48-tonners
had
caused
serious
damage
to
the
_
Warspite
_
,
was
suddenly
rammed
and
sunk
by
the
_
Empress
of
India
<EOS>
_
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
the
decisive
battle
,
was
the
most
vigorously
contested
naval
fight
during
the
whole
of
the
hostilities
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
The
steel
leviathans
of
the
sea
were
being
rent
asunder
and
pulverised
by
the
terribly
destructive
modern
arms
,
and
amid
the
roar
and
crashing
of
the
guns
,
shells
were
bursting
everywhere
,
carrying
away
funnels
,
fighting
tops
,
and
superstructures
,
and
wrecking
the
crowded
spaces
between
the
decks
.
<EOS>
Turrets
and
barbettes
were
torn
away
,
guns
dismounted
by
the
enormous
shells
from
heavy
guns
;
steel
armour
was
torn
up
and
thrown
aside
like
paper
,
and
many
shots
entering
broadsides
,
passed
clean
through
and
out
at
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Whitehead
torpedoes
,
carrying
heavy
charges
of
gun
-
cotton
,
exploded
now
and
then
under
the
enemy
's
ships
;
while
both
British
and
French
torpedo
boat
"
destroyers
,
"
running
at
the
speed
of
an
ordinary
train
,
were
sinking
or
capturing
where
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
dull
,
gloomy
afternoon
the
battle
continued
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
our
ships
met
with
serious
reverses
,
for
the
_

was
sunk
by
the
Russian
flagship
_
Alexander

.
<EOS>
_
,
assisted
by
two
French

,
and
this
catastrophe
was
followed
almost
immediately
by
the
torpedoing
of
the
new
British
cruiser

the
capture

]
 
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
however
,
the
vessels
had
approached
within
three
miles
of
Dungeness
,
and
the
_
Camperdown
_
,
_
Empress

,
<EOS>
_
Royal

_
,
_

_

,
lying
near
one
another
,
fought
nine
of
the
enemy

vessels
,
inflicting
upon
them
terrible
punishment
.
<EOS>
Shots
from
the
67-tonners
of
the
_
Empress

<EOS>
_
,
_
Royal

and
_
Camperdown
_
,
<EOS>
combined
with
those
from
the
22-tonners
of
the
_
Warspite
_
,
swept
the
enemy
's
vessels
with
devastating
effect
,
and
during
the
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
that
the
fight
between
these
vessels
lasted
,
the
scene
of
destruction
was
appalling
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
with
a
brilliant
flash
and
deafening
detonation
,
the
Russian
flagship
_
Alexander
II
.
<EOS>
_
,
one
of
the
vessels
now
engaging
the
five
British
ships
,
blew
up
and
sank
,
and
ere
the
enemy
could
recover
from
the
surprise
this
disaster
caused
them
,
the
_
Camperdown
_
rammed
the
_
Amiral
Baudin
_
,
while
the
_
Warspite
_
sank
the
French
cruiser
_
Cecille
_
,
the
submarine
boat
_
Gustave
Zede
_
,
and
afterwards
captured
the
torpedo
gunboat
_
Bombe
_
.
 
<EOS>
This
rapid
series
of
terrible
disasters
apparently
demoralised
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
They
fought
recklessly
,
and
amid
the
din
and
confusion
two
Russian
vessels
collided
,
and
were
so
seriously
damaged
that
both
settled
down
,
their
crews
being
rescued
by
British
torpedo
boats
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterwards
,
however
,
a
frightful
explosion
rent
the
air
with
a
deafening
sound
that
dwarfed
into
insignificance
the
roar
of
the
heavy
guns
,
and
the
French
battleship
_
Jaureguiberry
_
was
completely
broken
into
fragments
,
scarcely
any
of
her
hull
remaining
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
were
amazed
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
another
explosion
occurred
,
even
louder
than
the
first
.
<EOS>
For
a
second
the
French
battleship
_
Devastation
_
,
which
had
been
engaging
the
_
Royal
Sovereign
_
,
was
obscured
by
a
brilliant
flash
,
then
,
as
fragments
of
steel
and
human
limbs
were
precipitated
on
every
side
,
it
was
seen
that
that
vessel
also
had
been
completely
blown
out
of
the
water
!
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
stood
appalled
.
<EOS>
The
defenders
themselves
were
at
first
dumfounded
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
later
,
however
,
it
became
known
throughout
the
British
ships
that
the
battery
at
Dungeness
,
two
miles
and
a
half
distant
,
were
rendering
assistance
with
the
new
pneumatic
gun
,
the
secret
of
which
the
Government
had
guarded
so
long
and
so
well
.
<EOS>
Five
years
before
,
this
frightfully
deadly
weapon
had
been
tested
,
and
proved
so
successful
that
the
one
gun
made
was
broken
up
and
the
plans
preserved
with
the
utmost
secrecy
in
a
safe
at
the
War
Office
.
<EOS>
Now
,
however
,
several
of
the
weapons
had
been
constructed
,
and
one
of
them
had
been
placed
in
the
battery
at
Dungeness
.
<EOS>
The
British
vessels
drew
off
to
watch
the
awful
effect
of
the
fire
from
these
marvellous
and
terribly
destructive
engines
of
modern
warfare
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
would
not
surrender
,
so
time
after
time
the
deafening
explosions
sounded
,
and
time
after
time
the
hostile
ships
were
shattered
into
fragments
.
 
<EOS>
Each
shot
fired
by
this
new
pneumatic
gun
contained
900
lbs
.
<EOS>
of
dynamite
,
which
could
strike
effectively
at
four
miles
!
<EOS>
The
result
of
such
a
charge
exploding
on
a
ship
was
appalling
;
the
force
was
terrific
,
and
could
not
be
withstood
by
the
strongest
vessel
ever
constructed
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
great
armoured
vessels
were
being
pulverised
as
easily
as
glass
balls
struck
by
bullets
,
and
every
moment
hundreds
of
poor
fellows
were
being
hurled
into
eternity
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
enemy
discovered
the
distant
source
of
the
fire
,
and
prepared
to
escape
beyond
range
;
but
in
this
they
were
unsuccessful
,
for
,
after
a
renewed
and
terrific
fight
,
in
which
three
French
ironclads
were
sunk
and
two
of
our
cruisers
were
torpedoed
,
our
force
and
our
allies
the
Germans
succeeded
in
capturing
the
remainder
of
the
hostile
ships
and
torpedo
boats
.
 
<EOS>
The
struggle
had
been
frightful
,
but
the
victory
was
magnificent
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
the
British
ships
steamed
along
the
Sussex
coast
and
captured
the
whole
of
the
French
and
Russian
transports
,
the
majority
of
which
were
British
vessels
that
had
been
seized
while
lying
in
French
and
Russian
ports
at
the
time
war
was
declared
.
<EOS>
The
vessels
were
lying
between
Beachy
Head
and
Selsey
Bill
,
and
by
their
capture
the
enemy
's
means
of
retreat
were
at
once
totally
cut
off
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
the
British
Navy
had
shown
itself
worthy
of
its
reputation
,
and
England
regained
the
supremacy
of
the
seas
.

CHAPTER
XXXIX
.
 
<EOS>
THE
DAY
OF
RECKONING
.
  
<EOS>
The
Day
of
Reckoning
dawned
.
 
<EOS>
On
land
the
battle
was
terrific
;
the
struggle
was
the
most
fierce
and
bloody
of
any
during
the
invasion
.
<EOS>
The
British
Regulars
holding
the
high
ground
along
from
Crowborough
to
Ticehurst
,
and
from
Etchingham
,
through
Brightling
and
Ashburnham
,
down
to
Battle
,
advanced
in
a
huge
fighting
line
upon
the
enemy
's
base
around
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
The
onslaught
was
vigorously
repelled
,
and
the
battle
across
the
Sussex
Downs
quickly
became
a
most
wild
and
sanguinary
one
;
but
as
the
day
passed
,
although
the
defenders
were
numerically
very
weak
,
they
nevertheless
gradually
effected
terrible
slaughter
,
capturing
the
whole
of
the
enemy
's
stores
,
and
taking
nearly
five
thousand
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
In
Kent
the
French
had
advanced
from
East
Grinstead
through
Edenbridge
,
extending
along
the
hills
south
of
Westerham
,
and
in
consequence
of
these
rapid
successes
the
depot
of
stores
and
ammunition
which
had
been
maintained
at
Sevenoaks
was
being
removed
to
Bromley
by
rail
;
but
as
the
officer
commanding
the
British
troops
at
Eynsford
could
see
that
it
would
most
probably
be
impossible
to
get
them
all
away
before
Sevenoaks
was
attacked
,
orders
were
issued
that
at
a
certain
hour
the
remainder
should
be
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
force
covering
the
removal
only
consisted
of
two
battalions
of
the
Duke
of
Cambridge
's
Own
(
Middlesex
)
Regiment
and
half
a
squadron
of
the
9th
Lancers

the

north
of
Sevenoaks
from
Luddesdown
through
Stanstead

Farnborough

<EOS>
The
events
which
occurred
outside
Sevenoaks
are
perhaps
best
described
by
Capt
.
A.
E.
Brown
,
of
the
4th
V.B.
West
Surrey
Regiment
,
who
was
acting
as
one
of
the
special
correspondents
of
the
_
Standard
_
.
<EOS>
He
wrote--
 
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
command
of
a
piquet
consisting
of
fifty
men
of
my
regiment
at
Turvan
's
Farm
,
and
about
three
hours
before
the
time
to
destroy
the
remainder
of
the
stores
at
Sevenoaks
<EOS>
my
sentries
were
suddenly
driven
in
by
the
enemy
,
who
were
advancing
from
the
direction
of
Froghall
.
<EOS>
As
I
had
orders
to
hold
the
farm
at
any
cost
,
we
immediately
prepared
for
action
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
we
had
a
fair
supply
of
provisions
and
plenty
of
ammunition
,
for
since
War
had
broken
out
the
place
had
been
utilised
as
a
kind
of
outlying
fort
,
although
at
this
time
only
my
force
occupied
it
.
<EOS>
Our
equipment
included
two
machine
guns
,
and
it
was
mainly
by
the
aid
of
these
we
were
saved
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
strength
of
the
attacking
force
appeared
to
be
about
four
battalions
of
French
infantry
and
a
battalion
of
Zouaves
,
with
two
squadrons
of
Cuirassiers
.
<EOS>
Their
intention
was
,
no
doubt
,
to
cut
the
railway
line
near
Twitton
,
and
thus
prevent
the
removal
of
the
Sevenoaks
stores
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
cavalry
scouts
came
within
range
we
gave
them
a
few
sharp
volleys
,
and
those
who
were
able
immediately
retired
in
disorder
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
however
,
the
farm
was
surrounded
,
but
I
had
previously
sent
information
to
our
reserves
,
and
suggested
that
a
sharp
watch
should
be
kept
upon
the
line
from
Twitton
to
Sevenoaks
,
for
of
course
I
could
do
nothing
with
my
small
force
.
<EOS>
Dusk
was
now
creeping
on
,
and
as
the
enemy
remained
quiet
for
a
short
time
it
seemed
as
though
they
intended
to
assault
our
position
when
it
grew
dark
.
 
<EOS>
"
Before
night
set
in
,
however
,
my
messenger
,
who
had
managed
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
enemy
,
returned
,
with
a
letter
from
a
brother
officer
stating
that
a
great
naval
battle
had
been
fought
in
the
Channel
;
and
further
,
that
the
enemy
's
retreat
had
been
cut
off
,
and
that
the
Kentish
defenders
had
already
retaken
the
invaders
'
base
at
Eastbourne
.
<EOS>
If
we
could
,
therefore
,
still
hold
the
Surrey
Hills
,
there
was
yet
a
chance
of
thoroughly
defeating
the
French
and
Russians
,
even
though
one
strong
body
was
reported
as
having
taken
Guildford
and
Leatherhead
,
and
was
now
marching
upon
London
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
evening
drew
on
we
could
hear
heavy
firing
in
the
direction
of
Sevenoaks
,
but
as
we
also
heard
a
train
running
<EOS>
it
became
evident
that
we
still
held
the
station
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
soon
after
dark
there
was
a
brilliant
flash
<EOS>
which
for
a
second
lit
up
the
country
around
like
day
,
and
a
terrific
report
followed
.
<EOS>
We
knew
the
remainder
of
our
stores
and
ammunition
had
been
demolished
in
order
that
it
should
not
fall
into
the
enemy
's
hands
!
 
<EOS>
"
Shortly
afterwards
we
were
vigorously
attacked
,
and
our
position
quickly
became
almost
untenable
by
the
dozens
of
bullets
projected
in
every
direction
where
the
flash
of
our
rifles
could
be
seen
.
<EOS>
Very
soon
some
of
the
farm
outbuildings
fell
into
the
hands
of
the
Frenchmen
,
and
they
set
them
on
fire
,
together
with
a
number
of
haystacks
,
in
order
to
burn
us
out
.
<EOS>
This
move
,
however
,
proved
pretty
disastrous
to
them
,
for
the
leaping
flames
quickly
rendered
it
light
as
day
,
and
showed
them
up
,
while
at
the
same
time
flashes
from
our
muzzles
were
almost
invisible
to
them
.
<EOS>
Thus
we
were
enabled
to
bring
our
two
machine
guns
into
action
,
and
break
up
every
party
of
Frenchmen
who
showed
themselves
.
<EOS>
Away
over
Sevenoaks
there
was
a
glare
in
the
sky
,
for
the
enemy
were
looting
and
burning
the
town
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
however
,
our
men
who
had
been
defending
the
place
had
retreated
to
Dunton
Green
after
blowing
up
the
stores
,
and
there
they
re
-
formed
and
were
quickly
moving
off
in
the
direction
of
Twitton
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
they
had
heard
the
commencement
of
the
attack
on
us
,
and
the
commander
,
halting
his
force
,
had
sent
out
scouts
towards
Chevening
,
and
it
appeared
they
reached
us
just
at
the
moment
the
enemy
had
fired
the
stacks
.
<EOS>
They
worked
splendidly
,
and
,
after
going
nearly
all
round
the
enemy
's
position
,
returned
and
reported
to
their
Colonel
,
who
at
once
resolved
to
relieve
us
.
 
<EOS>
"
As
may
be
imagined
,
we
were
in
a
most
critical
position
by
this
time
,
especially
as
we
were
unaware
that
assistance
was
so
near
.
<EOS>
We
had
been
ordered
to
hold
the
farm
,
and
we
meant
to
do
it
as
long
as
breath
remained
in
our
bodies
.
<EOS>
All
my
men
worked
magnificently
,
and
displayed
remarkable
coolness
,
even
at
the
moment
when
death
stared
us
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
The
reports
of
the
scouts
enabled
their
Colonel
to
make
his
disposition
very
carefully
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
the
enemy
were
almost
completely
surrounded
.
<EOS>
We
afterwards
learnt
that
our
reserves
at
Stockholm
Wood
had
sent
out
a
battalion
,
which
fortunately
came
in
touch
with
the
survivors
of
the
Sevenoaks
force
just
as
they
opened
a
desperate
onslaught
upon
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
the
fierce
flames
and
blinding
smoke
from
the
burning
stacks
belching
in
our
faces
,
we
fought
on
with
fire
around
us
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
As
the
fire
drew
nearer
to
us
<EOS>
the
heat
became
intense
,
the
showers
of
sparks
galled
us
almost
as
much
as
the
enemy
's
bullets
,
and
some
of
us
had
our
eyebrows
and
hair
singed
by
the
fierce
flames
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
as
much
as
we
could
do
to
keep
our
ammunition
from
exploding
;
nevertheless
we
kept
up
our
stream
of
lead
,
pouring
volley
after
volley
upon
those
who
had
attacked
us
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
with
such
a
barrier
of
flame
and
obscuring
smoke
between
us
we
could
see
but
little
in
the
darkness
beyond
,
and
we
all
knew
that
if
we
emerged
from
cover
we
should
be
picked
off
easily
and
not
a
man
would
survive
.
<EOS>
The
odds
were
against
us
.
<EOS>
More
than
twenty
of
my
brave
fellows
had
fired
their
last
shot
,
and
now
lay
with
their
dead
upturned
faces
looking
ghastly
in
the
brilliant
glare
,
while
a
number
of
others
had
sunk
back
wounded
.
<EOS>
The
heat
was
frightful
,
the
smoke
stifling
,
and
I
had
just
given
up
all
hope
of
relief
,
and
had
set
my
teeth
,
determined
to
die
like
an
Englishman
should
,
when
we
heard
a
terrific
volley
of
musketry
at
close
quarters
,
and
immediately
afterwards
a
dozen
British
bugles
sounded
the
charge
.
<EOS>
The
scene
of
carnage
that
followed
was
terrible
.
<EOS>
Our
comrades
gave
one
volley
from
their
magazines
rifles
,
and
then
charged
with
the
bayonet
,
taking
the
enemy
completely
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Frenchmen
tried
to
rally
,
but
in
vain
,
and
among
those
huge
burning
barns
and
blazing
ricks
they
all
fell
or
were
captured
.
<EOS>
Dozens
of
them
struggled
valiantly
till
the
last
;
but
,
refusing
to
surrender
,
they
were
slaughtered
amid
a
most
frightful
scene
of
blood
and
fire
.
<EOS>
The
events
of
that
night
were
horrible
,
and
the
true
extent
of
the
losses
on
both
sides
was
only
revealed
when
the
flames
died
down
and
the
parting
clouds
above
heralded
another
grey
and
toilsome
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
Late
on
the
previous
evening
the
advance
guard
of
the
enemy
proceeding
north
towards
Caterham
came
in
touch
with
the
defenders
north
of
Godstone
.
<EOS>
The
French
cavalry
had
seized
Red
Hill
Junction
Station
at
sundown
,
and
some
of
their
scouts
suddenly
came
upon
a
detached
post
of
the
17th
Middlesex
Volunteers
at
Tyler
's
Green
,
close
to
Godstone
.
<EOS>
A
very
sharp
skirmish
ensued
,
but
the
Volunteers
,
although
suffering
severe
losses
,
held
their
own
,
and
the
cavalry
went
off
along
the
Oxted
Road
.
<EOS>
This
being
reported
to
the
British
General
,
special
orders
were
at
once
sent
to
Col
.
Trotter
,
the
commander
of
this
section
of
the
outpost
line
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
reports
of
the
inhabitants
and
of
scouts
sent
out
in
plain
clothes
,
it
was
believed
that
the
French
intended
massing
near
Tandridge
,
and
that
they
would
therefore
wait
for
supports
before
attempting
to
break
through
our
outpost
line
,
which
still
remained
intact
from
the
high
ground
east
of
Leatherhead
to
the
hills
north
of
Sevenoaks
.
<EOS>
During
the
night
Oxted
and
Godstone
were
occupied
by
the
enemy
,
and
early
in
the
morning
their
advance
guard
,
consisting
of
four
battalions
of
infantry
,
a
squadron
of
cavalry
,
a
battalion
of
Zouaves
,
and
a
section
of
field
artillery
,
proceeded
north
in
two
columns
,
one
along
the
Roman
road
leading
past
Rook
's
Nest
,
and
the
other
past
Flinthall
Farm
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
latter
place
the
sentries
of
the
17th
Middlesex
fell
back
upon
their
piquets
,
and
both
columns
of
the
enemy
came
into
action
simultaneously
.
<EOS>
The
French
infantry
on
the
high
road
soon
succeeded
in
driving
back
the
Volunteer
piquet
upon
the
supports
,
under
Lieut
.
<EOS>
Michaelis
,
stationed
at
the
junction
of
the
Roman
road
with
that
leading
to
Godstone
Quarry
.
<EOS>
A
strong
barricade
with
two
deep
trenches
in
front
had
here
been
constructed
,
and
as
soon
as
the
survivors
of
the
piquet
got
under
cover
,
two
of
the
defenders
'
machine
guns
opened
fire
from
behind
the
barricade
,
assisted
at
the
same
moment
by
a
battery
on
Gravelly
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
artillery
had
gone
on
towards
Flinthall
Farm
,
but
in
passing
the
north
edge
of
Rook
's
Nest
Park
their
horses
were
shot
by
some
Inniskilling
Fusiliers
lying
in
ambush
,
and
by
these
two
reverses
,
combined
with
the
deadly
fire
from
the
two
machine
guns
at
the
farm
,
the
column
was
very
quickly
thrown
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
decided
to
make
a
counter
attack
,
and
the
available
companies
at
this
section
of
the
outpost
line
,
under
Col
.
Brown
and
Col
.
Roche
,
succeeded
,
after
nearly
two
hours
'
hard
fighting
,
in
retaking
Godstone
and
Oxted
,
compelling
the
few
survivors
of
the
enemy
's
advance
guard
to
fall
back
to
Blindley

<EOS>
In
the
meantime
our
troops
occupying
the
line
from
Halstead
to
Chatham
and
Maidstone
went
down
into
battle
,
attacking
the
French
right
wing
at
the
same
time
as
the
Indians
were
attacking
their
left
,
while
the
Volunteers
from
the
Surrey
Hills
engaged
the
main
body
.
<EOS>
The
day
was
blazing
hot
,
the
roads
dusty
,
and
there
was
scarce
a
breath
of
wind
.
<EOS>
So
hot
,
indeed
,
was
it
,
that
many
on
both
sides
fell
from
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
sheer
starvation
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
although
the
force
of
the
invaders
was
nearly
twice
the
numerical
strength
of
the
defenders
,
the
latter
fought
on
with
undaunted
courage
,
striking
their
swift
,
decisive
blows
for
England
and
their
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
The
enemy
,
now
driven
into
a
triangle
,
fought
with
demoniacal
strength
,
and
that
frenzied
courage
begotten
of
despair
.
<EOS>
On
the
hills
around
Sevenoaks
and
across
to
the
valley
at
Otford
,
the
slaughter
of
the
French
was
fearful
.
<EOS>
Britons
fighting
for
their
homes
and
their
country
were
determined
that
Britannia
should
still
be
Ruler
of
the

From

by

totally
cut
up

Over

however

they
rallied
,
and
some
brilliant
charges
by
Cossacks
,
the
slaughter
of
a
portion
of
our
advance
guard
,
and
the
capture
of
one
of
our
Volunteer

on
Botley

,
checked
our

<EOS>
The
French
,
finding
their
right
flank
being
so
terribly
cut
up
,
had
suddenly
altered
their
tactics
,
and
were
now
concentrating
their
forces
upon
the
Volunteer
position
at
Caterham
in
an
endeavour
to
break
through

position
held
by

West

suffered
severely

owing
to
the
repeated
charges
of
the
French
Dragoons
along
the
highway
between
Oxted

,
nevertheless
the

But
into

the

put
his
whole
strength

from
noon

four
o'clock
the

a
fierce

who
lay
with
blanched

bloodless

prepared

the

they
defeated

drove
them
back
,
and
slaughtered
them
in
a
manner
that
to
a
non

was
horrible
and
appalling
.
<EOS>
Time
after
time
,
the
enemy
,
still
being
harassed
by
the
British
Regulars
on
their
right
,
charged
up
the
valley
,
in
order
to
take
the
battery
at
Harestone
Farm
;
but
on
each
occasion
few
of
those
who
dashed
forward
survived
.
<EOS>
The
dusty
roads
,
the
grassy
slopes
,
and
the
ploughed
lands
were
covered
with
corpses
,
and
blood
draining
into
the
springs
and
rivulets
tinged
their
crystal
waters
.
 
<EOS>
As
afternoon
passed
and
the
battle
continued
,
it
was
by
no
means
certain
that
success
in
this
fierce
final
struggle
would
lie
with
us
.
<EOS>
Having
regard
to
the
enormous
body
of
invaders
now
concentrated
on
the
Surrey
border
,
and
striving
by
every
device
to
force
a
passage
through
our
lines
,
our
forces
,
spread
over
such
a
wide
area
and
outflanking
them
,
were
necessarily
weak
.
<EOS>
It
was
therefore
only
by
the
excellent
tactics
displayed
by
our
officers
,
and
the
magnificent
courage
of
the
men
themselves
,
that
we
had
been
enabled
to
hold
back
these
overwhelming
masses
,
which
had
already
desolated
Sussex
with
fire
and
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Our
Regulars
operating
along
the
old
Roman
highway
through
Blindley
Heath
--
where
the
invaders
were
making
a
desperate
stand
--
and
over
to
Lingfield
,
succeeded
,
after
very
hard
fighting
,
in
clearing
the
enemy
off
the
railway
embankment
from
Crowhurst
along
to
South
Park
Farm
,
and
following
them
up
,
annihilated
them
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
,
just
at
sundown
,
a
strong
division
of
the
enemy
were
outflanked
at
Godstone
,
and
,
refusing
to
lay
down
their
arms
,
were
simply
swept
out
of
existence
,
scarcely
a
single
man
escaping
.
<EOS>
Thus
forced
back
from
,
perhaps
,
the
most
vulnerable
point
in
our
defences
,
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
were
then
driven
away
upon
Redhill
,
still
fighting
fiercely
.
<EOS>
Over
Redstone
Hill
,
through
Mead
Vale
,
and
across
Reigate
Park
to
the
Heath
,
the
enemy
were
shot
down
in
hundreds
by
our
Regulars
;
while
our
Volunteers
,
whose
courage
never
deserted
them
,
engaged
the
French
in
hand
-
to
-
hand
encounters
through
the
streets
of
Redhill
and
Reigate
,
as
far
as
Underhill
Park
.
 
<EOS>
In
Hartswood
a
company
of
the
4th
East
Surrey
Rifles
,
under
Major
S.
B.
Wheaton
,
V.D.
,
were
lying
in
ambush
,
when
suddenly
among
the
trees
they
caught
glimpses
of
red
,
baggy
trousers
,
and
scarlet
,
black
-
tasselled
fezes
,
and
a
few
seconds
later
they
found
that
a
large
force
of
Zouaves
were
working
through
the
wood
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
elapsed
,
and
the
combat
commenced
.
<EOS>
The
Algerians
fought
like
demons
,
and
with
bullet
and
bayonet
inflicted
terrible
punishment
upon
us
;
but
as
they
emerged
into
the
road
preparatory
to
firing
a
volley
into
the
thickets
,
they
were
surprised
by
a
company
of
the
2nd
Volunteer
Battalion
of
the
East
Surrey
Regiment
,
under
Capt
.
<EOS>
Pott
,
who
killed
and
wounded
half
their
number
,
and
took
the
remainder
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
Gradually
our
Volunteer
brigades
occupying
the
long
range
of
hills
united
with
our
Regulars
still
on
the
enemy
's
right
from
Reigate
to
Crawley
,
and
closed
down
upon
the
foe
,
slowly
narrowing
the
sphere
of
their
operations
,
and
by
degrees
forcing
them
back
due
westward
.
<EOS>
Russians
and
French
,
who
had
attacked
Dorking
,
had
by
this
time
been
defeated
with
heavy
loss
,
and
by
dusk
the
main
body
had
been
thrown
back
to
Newdigate
,
where
in
Reffold
's
Copse
one
or
two
very
sanguinary
encounters
occurred
.
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
not
always
in
our
favour
,
for
the
Civil
Service
Volunteers
here
sustained
very
heavy
losses
.
<EOS>
On
the
railway
embankment
,
and
on
the
road
running
along
the
crest
of
the
hill
to
Dorking
,
the
French
made
a
stand
,
and
there
wrought
frightful
execution
among
our
men
with
their
machine
guns
.
<EOS>
Around
Beare
Green
,
Trout
's
Farm
,
and
behind
the
"
White
Hart
"
at
Holmwood
,
the
enemy
rapidly
brought
their
guns
into
play
,
and
occupied
such
strong
strategic
positions
that
as
night
drew
on
it
became
evident
that
they
intended
to
remain
there
until
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
defenders
had
but
little
cover
,
and
consequently
felt
the
withering
fire
of
the
French
very
severely
.
<EOS>
The
latter
had
entrenched
themselves
,
and
now
in
the
darkness
it
was
difficult
for
our
men
to
discern
their
exact
position
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
situation
of
our
forces
became
very
serious
and
unsafe
as
night
proceeded
;
but
at
length
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
a
strong
force
of
British
Regulars
,
including
the
Sikhs
and
a
detachment
of
Australians
,
swept
along
the
road
from
Dorking
,
and
came
suddenly
upon
the
French
patrols
.
<EOS>
These
were
slaughtered
with
little
resistance
,
and
almost
before
the
enemy
were
aware
of
it
,
the
whole
position
was
completely
surrounded
.
 
<EOS>
Our
men
then
used
their
field
search
-
lights
with
very
great
advantage
;
for
,
as
the
enemy
were
driven
out
into
the
open
,
they
were
blinded
by
the
glare
,
and
fell
an
easy
prey
to
British
rifles
;
while
the
Frenchmen
's
own
machine
guns
were
turned
upon
them
with
frightful
effect
,
their
battalions
being
literally
mowed
down
by
the
awful
hail
of
bullets
.

night
the
battle
still
raged
furiously
.
<EOS>
The
enemy
fought
on
with
reckless
,
unparalleled
daring
.
<EOS>
Chasseurs
and
Zouaves
,
Cuirassiers
,
Dragoons
,
and
infantry
from
the
Loire
and
the
Rhone
struggled
desperately
,
contesting
every
step
,
and
confident
of
ultimate
victory
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
enemy
had
at
last
,
by
the
splendid
tactics
of
the
defenders
,
been
forced
into
a
gradually
contracting
square
,
bounded
by
Dorking
and
Guildford
in
the
north
,
and
Horsham
and
Billinghurst
in
the
south
,
and
soon
after
midnight
,
with
a
concentric
movement
from
each
of
the
four
corners
,
British
Regulars
and
Volunteers
advanced
steadily
upon
the
foe
,
surrounding
and
slaughtering
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
horrors
of
that
night
were
frightful
;
the
loss
of
life
on
every
hand
enormous
.
<EOS>
Britannia
had
husbanded
her
full
strength
until
this
critical
moment
;
for
now
,
when
the
fate
of
her
Empire
hung
upon
a
single
thread
,
she
sent
forth
her
valiant
sons
,
who
fell
upon
those
who
had
desecrated
and
destroyed
their
homes
,
and
wreaked
a
terrible
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
Through
the
dark
,
sultry
hours
this
awful
destruction
of
life
continued
with
unabated
fury
,
and
many
a
Briton
closed
with
his
foe
in
death
embrace
,
or
fell
forward
mortally
wounded
.
<EOS>
Of
British
heroes
there
were
many
that
night
,
for
true
pluck
showed
itself
everywhere
,
and
Englishmen
performed
many
deeds
worthy
their
traditions
as
the
most
courageous
and
undaunted
among
nations
.

Although
the
French
Commander
-
in
-
chief
had
been
killed
,
yet
the
enemy
still
fought
on
tenaciously
,
holding
their
ground
on
Leith
Hill
and
through
Pasture
Wood
to
Wotton
and
Abinger
,
until
at

,
when
the
saffron
streak
in

heralded
another
blazing
day
,
the
straggling
,
exhausted
remnant
of
the
once
-
powerful
legions
of
France

Russia
,
perspiring
,
dust
-
covered
,
and
bloodstained
,
finding
they
stood
alone
,
and
that
the
whole
of
Sussex

Surrey
had
been
swept
and
their
comrades
slaughtered
,
laid
down
their

and
eventually
surrendered

<EOS>
After
these
three
breathless
days
of
butchery
and
bloodshed
England
was
at
last
victorious
!
 
<EOS>
In
this
final
struggle
for
Britain

freedom
the
invader
had
been
crushed
and
his
power
broken
;
for
,
thanks
to
our
gallant
citizen
soldiers

the
enemy
that
had
for
weeks
overrun
our
smiling
land
like
packs
of
hungry
wolves
,
wantonly
burning
our
homes
and
massacring
the
innocent

,
had
at

met
with
their
well

merited
deserts
,
and
now
lay
spread
over
the
miles
of
pastures
,
cornfields
,
and
forests

stark
,
cold

dead

<EOS>
Britain
had
at

vanquished
the
two
powerful
nations
that
had
sought
by
ingenious
conspiracy
to
accomplish
her
downfall
.
 
<EOS>
Thousands
of
her
brave
sons
had
,
alas
!
<EOS>
fallen
while
fighting
under
the
British
flag
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
principal
streets
of
her
gigantic
capital
were
only
parallel
lines
of
gaunt
,
blackened
ruins
,
and
many
of
her
finest
cities
lay
wrecked
,
shattered
,
and
desolate
;
yet
this
terrible
ordeal
had
happily
not
weakened
her
power
one
iota
,
nor
had
she
been
ousted
from
her
proud
position
as
chief
among
the
mighty
Empires
of
the
world

<EOS>
Three
days
after
the
great
and
decisive
battle
of
Caterham
,
the
British
troops
,
with
their
compatriots
from
the
Cape
,
Australia
,
Canada
,
and
India
,
entered
London
triumphantly
,
bringing
with
them
some
thousands
of
French

Russian
prisoners
.
<EOS>
In
the
streets
,
as
,
ragged
and
dusty
,
Britain
's
defenders
passed
through
on
their
way
to
a
great
Open

Air
Thanksgiving
Service
in
Hyde
Park
,
there
were
scenes
of
the
wildest
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
With
heartfelt
gratitude
,
the
people
,
scrambling
over
the
debris
heaped
each
side
of
the
streets

cheered
themselves
hoarse
;
<EOS>
the

grasping
the

weeping

,
raising

The
glad

caused
rejoicings
everywhere

<EOS>
England
,
feeling
herself
free

breathed
again

In
every
church
and
chapel
through
the
United
Kingdom
special
Services
of
Thanksgiving
for
deliverance
from
the
invaders
'
thrall
were
held
,
while
in
every
town
popular
fetes
were
organised
,
and
delighted
Britons
gaily
celebrated
their
magnificent
and
overwhelming
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
disastrous
struggle
between
nations
France
had
suffered
frightfully
.
<EOS>
Paris
,
bombarded
and
burning
,
capitulated
on
the
day
following
the
battle
of
Caterham
,
and
the
legions
of
the
Kaiser
marched
up
the
Boulevards
with
their
brilliant
cavalry
uniforms
flashing
in
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Over
the
Hotel
de
Ville
,
the
Government
buildings
on
the
Quai
d'Orsay
,
and
the
Ministries
of
War
and
Marine
,
the
German
flag
was
hoisted
,
and
waved
lazily
in
the
autumn
breeze
,
while
the
Emperor
William
himself
had
an
interview
with
the
French
President
at
the
Elysee
.
 
<EOS>
That
evening
all
France
knew
that
Paris
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
England
was
already
shipping
back
to
Dieppe
and
Riga
her
prisoners
of
war
,
and
negotiations
for
peace
had
commenced
.
<EOS>
As
security
against
any
further
attempts
on
England
,
Italian
troops
were
occupying
the
whole
of
Southern
France
from
Grenoble
to
Bordeaux
;
and
the
Germans
,
in
addition
to
occupying
Paris
,
had
established
their
headquarters
in
Moghilev
,
and
driven
back
the
Army
of
the
Tsar
far
beyond
the
Dnieper
.
 
<EOS>
From
both
France
and
Russia
,
Germany
demanded
huge
indemnities
,
as
well
as
a
large
tract
of
territory
in
Poland
,
and
the
whole
of
the
vast
Champagne
country
from
Givet
,
on
the
Belgian
frontier
,
down
to
the
Saone
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
days
later
France
was
forced
to
accept
the
preliminaries
of
a
treaty
which
we
proposed
.
<EOS>
This
included
the
cession
to
us
of
Algiers
,
with
its
docks
and
harbour
,
so
that
we
might
establish
another
naval
station
in
the
Mediterranean
,
and
the
payment
of
an
indemnity
of
L250,000,000
.
<EOS>
Our
demands
upon
Russia
at
the
same
time
were
that
she
should
withdraw
all
her
troops
from
Bokhara
,
and
should
cede
to
us
the
whole
of
that
portion
of
the
Trans
-
Caspian
territory
lying
between
the
mouths
of
the
Oxus
and
Kizil
Arvat
,
thence
along
the
Persian
frontier
to
Zulfikai
,
along
the
Afghan
frontier
to
Karki
,
and
from
there
up
the
bank
of
the
Oxus
to
the
Aral
Sea
.
<EOS>
This
vast
area
of
land
included
the
cities
of
Khiva
and
Merv
,
the
many
towns
around
Kara
Khum
,
the
country
of
the
Kara
Turkomans
,
the
Tekeh
and
the
Yomuts
,
and
the
annexation
of
it
by
Britain
would
effectually
prevent
the
Russians
ever
advancing
upon
India
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
these
huge
demands
,
in
addition
to
the
smaller
ones
by
Italy
and
Austria
,
a
Peace
Conference
was
opened
at
Brussels
without
delay
,
and
at
length
France
and
her
Muscovite
ally
,
both
vanquished
and
ruined
,
were
compelled
to
accept
the
proposals
of
Britain
and
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
on
November
16th
,
1897
,
the
Treaty
of
Peace
was
signed
,
and
eight
days
later
was
ratified
.
<EOS>
Then
the
huge
forces
of
the
Kaiser
gradually
withdrew
into
Germany
,
and
the
soldiers
of
King
Humbert
recrossed
the
Alps
,
while
we
shipped
back
the
remainder
of
our
prisoners
,
reopened
our
trade
routes
,
and
commenced
rebuilding
our
shattered
cities
.

CHAPTER
XLI
.
 
<EOS>
DAWN
.
  
<EOS>
A
raw
,
cold
December
morning
in
London
.
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
a
statuesque
sentry
on
the
Horse
Guards
'
Parade
,
the
wide
open
space
was
deserted
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
long
been
light
,
and
a
heavy
yellow
mist
still
hung
over
the
grass
in
St.
James
's
Park
.
 
<EOS>
A
bell
clanged
mournfully
.
<EOS>
Big
Ben
chimed
the
hour
,
and
then
boomed
forth
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
An
icy
wind
swept
across
the
gravelled
square
.
<EOS>
The
bare
,
black
branches
of
the
stunted
trees
creaked
and
groaned
,
and
the
lonely
sentry
standing
at
ease
before
his
box
rubbed
his
hands
and
shivered
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
side
door
opened
,
and
there
emerged
a
small
procession
.
<EOS>
Slowly
there
walked
in
front
a
clergyman
bare
-
headed
,
reciting
with
solemn
intonation
the
Burial
Service
.
<EOS>
Behind
him
,
with
unsteady
step
and
bent
shoulders
,
a
trembling
man
with
blanched
,
haggard
face
,
and
a
wild
look
of
terror
in
his
dark
,
deep
-
sunken
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
shabby
morning
-
coat
tightly
buttoned
,
and
his
hands
in
bracelets
of
steel
were
behind
his
back
.
 
<EOS>
Glancing
furtively
around
at
the
grey
dismal
landscape
,
he
shuddered
.
<EOS>
Beside
and
behind
him
soldiers
tramped
on
in
silence
.
 
<EOS>
The
officer
's
sword
grated
along
the
gravel
.
 
<EOS>
Suddenly
a
word
of
command
caused
them
to
halt
against
a
wall
,
and
a
sergeant
,
stepping
forward
,
took
a
handkerchief
and
tied
it
over
the
eyes
of
the
quivering
culprit
,
who
now
stood
with
his
back
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Another
word
from
the
officer
,
and
the
party
receded
some
distance
,
leaving
the
man
alone
.
<EOS>
The
monotonous
nasal
utterances
of
the
chaplain
still
sounded
as
four
privates
advanced
,
and
,
halting
,
stood
in
single
rank
before
the
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>

<EOS>
They
raised
their
rifles
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
momentary
pause
.
<EOS>
In
the
distance
a
dog
howled
dismally
.
 
<EOS>
A
sharp
word
of
command
broke
the
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
second
later
,
as
four
rifles
rang
out
simultaneously
,
the
condemned
man
tottered
forward
and
fell
heavily
on
the
gravel
,
shot
through
the
heart
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
spy
and
murderer
,
Karl
von
Beilstein
!
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
brought
from
Glasgow
to
London
in
order
that
certain
information
might
be
elicited
from
him
,
and
after
his
actions
had
been
thoroughly
investigated
by
a
military
court
,
he
had
been
sentenced
to
death
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
his
past
was
revealed
by
his
valet
Grevel
,
and
it
was
proved
that
,
in
addition
to
bringing
the
great
disaster
upon
England
,
he
had
also
betrayed
the
country
whose
roubles
purchased
his
cunningly
-
obtained
secrets
.
 
<EOS>
Geoffrey
Engleheart
,
although
gallantly
assisting
in
the
fight
outside
Leatherhead
,
and
subsequently
showing
conspicuous
bravery
during
the
Battle
of
Caterham
,
fortunately
escaped
with
nothing
more
severe
than
a
bullet
wound
in
the
arm
.
<EOS>
During
the
searching
private
inquiry
held
at
the
Foreign
Office
after
peace
was
restored
,
he
explained
the
whole
of
the
circumstances
,
and
was
severely
reprimanded
for
his
indiscretion
;
but
as
no
suspicion
of
von
Beilstein
's
real
motive
had
been
aroused
prior
to
the
Declaration
of
War
,
and
as
it
was
proved
that
Geoffrey
was
entirely
innocent
of
any
complicity
in
the
affair
,
he
was
,
at
the
urgent
request
of
Lord
Stanbury
,
allowed
to
resume
his
duties
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
he
was
married
to
Violet
Vayne
,
and
Sir
Joseph
,
having
recovered
those
of
his
ships
that
had
been
seized
by
the
Russian
Government
,
was
thereby
enabled
to
give
his
daughter
a
handsome
dowry
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
French
clerk
who
had
been
engaged
at
the
Admiralty
,
and
who
had
committed
murder
for
gold
,
escaped
to
Spain
,
and
,
after
being
hunted
by
English
and
Spanish
detectives
for
many
weeks
,
he
became
apparently
overwhelmed
by
remorse
.
<EOS>
Not
daring
to
show
himself
by
day
,
nor
to
claim
the
money
that
had
been
promised
him
,
he
had
tramped
on
through
the
snow
from
village
to
village
in
the
unfrequented
valleys
of
Lerida
,
while
his
description
was
being
circulated
throughout
the
Continent
.
<EOS>
Cold
,
weary
,
and
hungry
,
he
one
night
entered
the
Posada
de
las
Pijorras
at
the
little
town
of
Oliana
,
at
the
foot
of
the
Sierra
del
Cadi
.
<EOS>
Calling
for
wine
,
he
took
up
a
dirty
crumpled
copy
of
the
Madrid
_
Globo
_
,
three
days
old
.
<EOS>
A
paragraph
,
headed
"
The
Missing
Spy
,
"
caught
his
eyes
,
and
,
reading
eagerly
,
he
found
to
his
dismay
that
the
police
were
aware
that
he
had
been
in
Huesca
a
week
before
,
and
were
now
using
bloodhounds
to
track
him
!
 
<EOS>
The
paper
fell
from
his
nerveless
grasp
.
<EOS>
The
wine
at
his
elbow
he
swallowed
at
one
gulp
,
and
,
tossing
down
his
last
real
upon
the
table
<EOS>
,
he
rose
and
stumbled
away
blindly
into
the
darkness
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
wintry
dawn
spread
in
that
silent
,
distant
valley
,
it
showed
a
corpse
lying
in
the
snow
with
face
upturned
.
<EOS>
In
the
white
wrinkled
brow
was
a
small
dark
-
blue
hole
from
which
blood
had
oozed
over
the
pallid
cheek
,
leaving
an
ugly
stain
.
<EOS>
The
staring
eyes
were
wide
open
,
with
a
look
of
unutterable
horror
in
them
,
and
beside
the
thin
clenched
hand
lay
a
revolver
,
one
chamber
of
which
had
been
discharged
!

The
dreary
gloom
of
winter
passed
,
and
there
dawned
a
new
era
of
prosperity
for
England
.
 
<EOS>
Dark
days
were
succeeded
by
a
period
of
happiness
and
rejoicing
,
and
Britannia
,
grasping
her
trident
again

seated
herself

Ruler
