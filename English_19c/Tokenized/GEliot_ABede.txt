The
Workshop
  
<EOS>
With
a
single
drop
of
ink
for
a
mirror
,
the
Egyptian
sorcerer
undertakes
to
reveal
to
any
chance
comer
far
-
reaching
visions
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
undertake
to
do
for
you
,
reader
.
<EOS>
With
this
drop
of
ink
at
the
end
of
my
pen
,
I
will
show
you
the
roomy
workshop
of
Mr.
Jonathan
Burge
,
carpenter
and
builder
,
in
the
village
of
Hayslope
,
as
it
appeared
on
the
eighteenth
of
June
,
in
the
year
of
our
Lord
1799
.
  
<EOS>
The
afternoon
sun
was
warm
on
the
five
workmen
there
,
busy
upon
doors
and
window
-
frames
and
wainscoting
.
<EOS>
A
scent
of
pine
-
wood
from
a
tentlike
pile
of
planks
outside
the
open
door
mingled
itself
with
the
scent
of
the
elder
-
bushes
which
were
spreading
their
summer
snow
close
to
<EOS>
the
open
window
opposite
;
the
slanting
sunbeams
shone
through
the
transparent
shavings
that
flew
before
the
steady
plane
,
and
lit
up
the
fine
grain
of
the
oak
panelling
which
stood
propped
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
On
a
heap
of
those
soft
shavings
a
rough
,
grey
shepherd
dog
had
made
himself
a
pleasant
bed
,
and
was
lying
with
his
nose
between
his
fore
-
paws
,
occasionally
wrinkling
his
brows
to
cast
a
glance
at
the
tallest
of
the
five
workmen
,
who
was
carving
a
shield
in
the
centre
of
a
wooden
mantelpiece
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
this
workman
that
the
strong
barytone
belonged
which
was
heard
above
the
sound
of
plane
and
hammer
singing
         
Awake
,
my
soul
,
and
with
the
sun
     
Thy
daily
stage
of
duty
run
;
     
Shake
off
dull
sloth
...
  
<EOS>
Here
some
measurement
was
to
be
taken
which
required
more
concentrated
attention
,
and
the
sonorous
voice
subsided
into
a
low
whistle
;
but
it
presently
broke
out
again
with
renewed
vigour
         
<EOS>
Let
all
thy
converse
be
sincere
,
     
Thy
conscience
as
the
noonday
clear
.
  
<EOS>
Such
a
voice
could
only
come
from
a
broad
chest
,
and
the
broad
chest
belonged
to
a
large
-
boned
,
muscular
man
nearly
six
feet
high
,
with
a
back
so
flat
and
a
head
<EOS>
so
well
poised
that
when
he
drew
himself
up
to
take
a
more
distant
survey
of
his
work
,
he
had
the
air
of
a
soldier
standing
at
ease
.
<EOS>
The
sleeve
rolled
up
above
the
elbow
<EOS>
showed
an
arm
that
was
likely
to
win
the
prize
for
feats
of
strength
;
yet
the
long
supple
hand
,
with
its
broad
finger
-
tips
,
looked
ready
for
works
of
skill
.
<EOS>
In
his
tall
stalwartness
Adam
Bede
was
a
Saxon
,
and
justified
his
name
;
but
the
jet
-
black
hair
,
made
the
more
noticeable
by
its
contrast
with
the
light
paper
cap
,
and
the
keen
glance
of
the
dark
eyes
that
shone
from
under
strongly
marked
,
prominent
and
mobile
eyebrows
,
indicated
a
mixture
of
Celtic
blood
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
large
and
roughly
hewn
,
and
when
in
repose
had
no
other
beauty
than
such
as
belongs
to
an
expression
of
good
-
humoured
honest
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
clear
at
a
glance
that
the
next
workman
is
Adam
's
brother
.
<EOS>
He
is
nearly
as
tall
;
he
has
the
same
type
of
features
,
the
same
hue
of
hair
and
complexion
;
but
the
strength
of
the
family
likeness
seems
only
to
render
more
conspicuous
the
remarkable
difference
of
expression
both
in
form
and
face
.
<EOS>
Seth
's
broad
shoulders
have
a
slight
stoop
;
his
eyes
are
grey
;
his
eyebrows
have
less
prominence
and
more
repose
than
his
brother
's
;
and
his
glance
,
instead
of
being
keen
,
is
confiding
and
benign
.
<EOS>
He
has
thrown
off
his
paper
cap
,
and
you
see
that
his
hair
is
not
thick
and
straight
,
like
Adam
's
,
but
thin
and
wavy
,
allowing
you
to
discern
the
exact
contour
of
a
coronal
arch
that
predominates
very
decidedly
over
the
brow
.
  
<EOS>
The
idle
tramps
always
felt
sure
they
could
get
a
copper
from
Seth
;
they
scarcely
ever
spoke
to
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
The
concert
of
the
tools
and
Adam
's
voice
was
at
last
broken
by
Seth
,
who
,
lifting
the
door
at
which
he
had
been
working
intently
,
placed
it
against
the
wall
,
and
said
,
"
There
!
<EOS>
I
've
finished
my
door
to
-
day
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
workmen
all
looked
up
;
Jim
Salt
,
a
burly
,
red
-
haired
man
known
as
Sandy
Jim
,
paused
from
his
planing
,
and
Adam
said
to
Seth
,
with
a
sharp
glance
of
surprise
,
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Dost
think
thee'st
finished
the
door
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
sure
,
"
said
Seth
,
with
answering
surprise
;
"
what
's
awanting
to't
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
loud
roar
of
laughter
from
the
other
three
workmen
made
Seth
look
round
confusedly
.
<EOS>
Adam
did
not
join
in
the
laughter
,
but
there
was
a
slight
smile
on
his
face
as
he
said
,
in
a
gentler
tone
than
before
,
"
Why
,
thee'st
forgot
the
panels
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
laughter
burst
out
afresh
as
Seth
clapped
his
hands
to
his
head
,
and
coloured
over
brow
and
crown
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hoorray
!
"
shouted
a
small
lithe
fellow
called
Wiry
Ben
,
running
forward
and
seizing
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
hang
up
th
'
door
at
fur
end
<EOS>
o
'
th
'
shop

Seth
Bede
,
the
Methody
,
his
work
.
"
<EOS>
Here

Jim
,

's
hould
o
'
th
'
red
pot

<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
!
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
Let
it
alone
,
Ben
Cranage
.
<EOS>
You
'll
mayhap
be
making
such
a
slip
yourself
some
day
;
you
'll
laugh
o
'
th
'
other
side
<EOS>
o
'
your
mouth
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Catch
me
at
it
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
good
while
afore
my
head
's
full
o
'
th
'
Methodies
,
"
said
Ben
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
it
's
often
full
o
'
drink
,
and
that
's
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Ben
,
however
,
had
now
got
the
"
red
pot
"
in
his
hand
,
and
was
about
to
begin
writing
his
inscription
,
making
,
by
way
of
preliminary
,
an
imaginary
S
in
the
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
it
alone
,
will
you
?
"
<EOS>
Adam
called
out
,
laying
down
his
tools
,
striding
up
to
Ben
,
and
seizing
his
right
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Let
it
alone
,
or
I
'll
shake
the
soul
out
o
'
your
body
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Ben
shook
in
Adam
's
iron
grasp
,
but
,
like
a
plucky
small
man
as
he
was
,
he
did
n't
mean
to
give
in
.
<EOS>
With
his
left
hand
he
snatched
the
brush
from
his
powerless
right
,
and
made
a
movement
as
if
he
would
perform
the
feat
of
writing
with
his
left
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
Adam
turned
him
round
,
seized
his
other
shoulder
,
and
,
pushing
him
along
,
pinned
him
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
But
now
Seth
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
be
,
Addy
,
let
be
.
<EOS>
Ben
will
be
joking
.
<EOS>
Why
,
he
's
i
'
the
right
to
laugh
at
me
 
<EOS>
I
canna
help
laughing
at
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
sha
n't
loose
him
till
he
promises
to
let
the
door
alone
,
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Ben
,
lad
,
"
said
Seth
,
in
a
persuasive
tone
,
"
do
n't
let
's
have
a
quarrel
about
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
Adam
will
have
his
way
.
<EOS>
You
may
's
well
try
to
turn
a
waggon
in
a
narrow
lane
.
<EOS>
Say
you
'll
leave
the
door
alone
,
and
make
an
end
on't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
binna
frighted
at
Adam
,
"
said
Ben
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
donna
mind
sayin
'
as
I
'll
let
'
t
alone
at
your
askin

,
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
that
's
wise
of
you
,
Ben
,
"
said
Adam
,
laughing
and
relaxing
his
grasp
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
returned
to
their
work
now
;
but
Wiry
Ben
,
having
had
the
worst
in
the
bodily
contest
,
was
bent
on
retrieving
that
humiliation
by
a
success
in
sarcasm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Which
was
ye
thinkin

on

Seth

he
began
 
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
and
hear
her
,
Ben

"
said
Seth
,
good
-
humouredly
;
"
she
's
going
to
preach
on
the
Green
to

night

happen
ye'd
get
something

Ye

<EOS>
"
All

No

neither

Only

"
  
"
Come

said
Adam
,
rather
sternly
,
"
you

Never

That

between

"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
laugh
at
this
thrust
of
Adam
's
,
but
Seth
said
,
very
seriously
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
Addy
,
thee
mustna
say
as
anybody
's
religion
's
like
thick

Thee
dostna
believe
but
what
the
dissenters
and
the
Methodists
have
got
<EOS>
the
root
o
'
the
matter
as
well
as
the
church
folks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Seth
,
lad
;
I
'm
not
for
laughing
at
no
man
's
religion
.
<EOS>
Let
'em
follow
their
consciences
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
Only
I
think
it
'
ud
be
better
if
their
consciences
'
ud
let
'em
stay
quiet
<EOS>
i
'
the
church
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
deal
to
be
learnt
there
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
such
a
thing
as
being
oversperitial
;
we
must
have
something
beside
<EOS>
Gospel
i
'
this
world
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
canals
,
an
'
th
'
aqueduc
's
,
an
'
th
'
coal
-
pit
engines
,
and
Arkwright
's
mills
there
at
Cromford
;
a
man
must
learn
summat
beside
Gospel
to
make
them
things
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
But
t
'
hear
some
o
'
<EOS>
them
preachers
,
you
'd
think
as
a
man
must
be
doing
nothing
all
's
life
but
shutting
's
eyes
and
looking
what
's
agoing
on
inside
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
a
man
must
have
<EOS>
the
love
o
'
God
in
his
soul
,
and
the
Bible
's
God
's
word
.
<EOS>
But
what
does
the
Bible
say
?
<EOS>
Why
,
it
says
as
God
put
his
sperrit
into
the
workman
as
built
the
tabernacle
,
to
make
him
do
all
the
carved
work
and
things
as
wanted
a
nice
hand
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
my
way
o

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

"
said
Sandy
Jim
,
who
had
paused
from
his
planing
to
shift
his
planks
while
Adam
was
speaking
;
"
that
's
the

By

"
  
<EOS>
"
There

observed

gravely
.

<EOS>
But
thee

<EOS>
It

the

if

gets
religion

he

do

Seth

said
Adam
,
taking
no
notice
of
the
sarcasm
against
himself
,
"

"
  
<EOS>
All
hands
worked
on
in
silence
for
some
minutes
,
until
the
church
clock
began
to
strike
six
.
<EOS>
Before
the
first
stroke
had
died
away
,
Sandy
Jim
had
loosed
his
plane
and
was
reaching
his
jacket
;
Wiry
Ben
had
left
a
screw
half
driven
in
,
and
thrown
his
screwdriver
into
his
tool
-
basket
;
Mum
Taft
,
who
,
true
to
his
name
,
had
kept
silence
throughout
the
previous
conversation
,
had
flung
down
his
hammer
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
lifting
it
;
and
Seth
,
too
,
had
straightened
his
back
,
and
was
putting
out
his
hand
towards
his
paper
cap
.
<EOS>
Adam
alone
had
gone
on
with
his
work
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
But
observing
the
cessation
of
the
tools
,
he
looked
up
,
and
said
,
in
a
tone
of
indignation
,
"
<EOS>
Look
there
,
now
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
abide
to

the

much

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
looked
a
little
conscious
,
and
began
to
be
slower
in
his
preparations
for
going
,
but
Mum
Taft
broke
silence
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>

Nonsense

said
Adam
,
still
wrathful
;
"

?
<EOS>

to

drop
down
as

was

,
before

fairly
struck
,
just
as

<EOS>
"
Bodderation

exclaimed
Wiry
Ben
;
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
exit
speech
,
which
he
considered
effective
,
Wiry
Ben
shouldered
his
basket
and
left
the
workshop
,
quickly
followed
by
Mum
Taft
and
Sandy
Jim
.
<EOS>
Seth
lingered
,
and
looked
wistfully
at
Adam
,
as
if
he
expected
him
to
say
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shalt
go
home
before
thee
go'st
to
the
preaching
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
asked
,
looking
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
I
've
got
my
hat
and
things
at
Will
Maskery
's
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
be
home
before
going
for

.
<EOS>
I
'll
happen

Dinah
Morris
safe
home
,
if
she
's
willing
.
<EOS>
There
's
nobody
comes
with
her
from
Poyser
's
,
thee
know'st
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
'll
tell
mother
not
to
look
for
thee
,
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
artna
going
to
Poyser
's
thyself
to
-
night
?
"
said
Seth
rather
timidly
,
as
he
turned
to
leave
the
workshop
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
'm
going
to
th
'
school
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Gyp
had
kept
his
comfortable
bed
,
only
lifting
up
his
head
and
watching
Adam
more
closely
as
he
noticed
the
other
workmen
departing
.
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
did
Adam
put
his
ruler
in
his
pocket
,
and
begin
to
twist
his
apron
round
his
waist
,
than
Gyp
ran
forward
and
looked
up
in
his
master
's
face
with
patient
expectation
.
<EOS>
If
Gyp
had
had
a
tail
he
would
doubtless
have
wagged
it
,
but
being
destitute
of
that
vehicle
for
his
emotions
,
he
was
like
many
other
worthy
personages
,
destined
to
appear
more
phlegmatic
than
nature
had
made
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Art
ready
for
the
basket
,
eh
,
Gyp
?
"
said
Adam
,
with
the
same
gentle
modulation
of
voice
as
when
he
spoke
to
Seth
.
  
<EOS>
Gyp
jumped
and
gave
a
short
bark
,
as
much
as
to
say
,
"
Of
course
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
,
he
had
not
a
great
range
of
expression
.
  
<EOS>
The
basket
was
the
one
which
on
workdays
held
Adam
's
and
Seth
's
dinner
;
and
no
official
,
walking
in
procession
,
could
look
more
resolutely
unconscious
of
all
acquaintances
than
Gyp
with
his
basket
,
trotting
at
his
master
's
heels
.
  
<EOS>
On
leaving
the
workshop
Adam
locked
the
door
,
took
the
key
out
,
and
carried
it
to
the
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
woodyard
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
low
house
,
with
smooth
grey
thatch
and
buff
walls
,
looking
pleasant
and
mellow
in
the
evening
light
.
<EOS>
The
leaded
windows
were
bright
and
speckless
,
and
the
door
-
stone
was
as
clean
as
a
white
boulder
at
ebb
tide
.
<EOS>
On
the
door
-
stone
stood
a
clean
old
woman
,
in
a
dark
-
striped
linen
gown
,
a
red
kerchief
,
and
a
linen
cap
,
talking
to
some
speckled
fowls
which
appeared
to
have
been
drawn
towards
her
by
an
illusory
expectation
of
cold
potatoes
or
barley
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
's
sight
seemed
to
be
dim
,
for
she
did
not
recognize
Adam
till
he
said
,
"
Here
's
the
key
,
Dolly
;
lay
it
down
for
me
in
the
house
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,

but
wunna

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No

Dolly
,
thank
you
;
I
'm
off
home
.
<EOS>
Good
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
hastened
with
long
strides
,
Gyp
close
to
his
heels
,
out
of
the
workyard
,
and
along
the
highroad
leading
away
from
the
village
and
down
to
the
valley
.
<EOS>
As
he
reached
the
foot
of
the
slope
,
an
elderly
horseman
,
with
his
portmanteau
strapped
behind
him
,
stopped
his
horse
when
Adam
had
passed
him
,
and
turned
round
to
have
another
long
look
at
the
stalwart
workman
in
paper
cap
,
leather
breeches
,
and
dark
-
blue
worsted
stockings
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
unconscious
of
the
admiration
he
was
exciting
,
presently
struck
across
the
fields
,
and
now
broke
out
into
the
tune
which
had
all
day
long
been
running
in
his
head
:
       
<EOS>
Let
all
thy
converse
be
sincere
,
     
Thy
conscience
as
the
noonday
clear
;
     
For
God
's
all
-
seeing
eye
surveys
     
<EOS>
Thy
secret
thoughts
,
thy
works
and
ways
.
    
<EOS>
The
Preaching
  
About
a
quarter
to
seven
there
was
an
unusual
appearance
of
excitement
in
the
village
of
Hayslope
,
and
through
the
whole
length
of
its
little
street
,
from
the
Donnithorne
Arms
to
the
churchyard
gate
,
the
inhabitants
had
evidently
been
drawn
out
of
their
houses
by
something
more
than
the
pleasure
of
lounging
in
the
evening
sunshine
.
<EOS>
The
Donnithorne
Arms
stood
at
the
entrance
of
the
village
,
and
a
small
farmyard
and
stackyard
which
flanked
it
,
indicating
that
there
was
a
pretty
take
of
land
attached
to
the
inn
,
gave
the
traveller
a
promise
of
good
feed
for
himself
and
his
horse
,
which
might
well
console
him
for
the
ignorance
in
which
the
weather
-
beaten
sign
left
him
as
to
the
heraldic
bearings
of
that
ancient
family
,
the
Donnithornes
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Casson
,
the
landlord
,
had
been
for
some
time
standing
at
the
door
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
balancing
himself
on
his
heels
and
toes
and
looking
towards
a
piece
of
unenclosed
ground
,
with
a
maple
in
the
middle
of
it
,
which
he
knew
to
be
the
destination
of
certain
grave
-
looking
men
and
women
whom
he
had
observed
passing
at
intervals
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Casson
's
person
was
by
no
means
of
that
common
type
which
can
be
allowed
to
pass
without
description
.
<EOS>
On
a
front
view
it
appeared
to
consist
principally
of
two
spheres
,
bearing
about
the
same
relation
to
each
other
as
the
earth
and
the
moon
:
that
is
to
say
,
the
lower
sphere
might
be
said
,
at
a
rough
guess
,
to
be
thirteen
times
larger
than
the
upper
which
naturally
performed
the
function
of
a
mere
satellite
and
tributary
.
<EOS>
But
here
the
resemblance
ceased
,
for
Mr.
Casson
's
head
was
not
at
all
a
melancholy
-
looking
satellite
nor
was
it
a
"
spotty
globe
,
"
as
Milton
has
irreverently
called
the
moon
;
on
the
contrary
,
no
head
and
face
could
look
more
sleek
and
healthy
,
and
its
expression
 
which
was
chiefly
confined
to
a
pair
of
round
and
ruddy
cheeks
,
the
slight
knot
and
interruptions
forming
the
nose
and
eyes
being
scarcely
worth
<EOS>
mention
 
<EOS>
was
one
of
jolly
contentment
,
only
tempered
by
that
sense
of
personal
dignity
which
usually
made
itself
felt
in
his
attitude
and
bearing
.
<EOS>
This
sense
of
dignity
could
hardly
be
considered
excessive
in
a
man
who
had
been
butler
to
"
the
family
"
for
fifteen
years
,
and
who
,
in
his
present
high
position
,
was
necessarily
very
much
in
contact
with
his
inferiors
.
<EOS>
How
to
reconcile
his
dignity
with
the
satisfaction
of
his
curiosity
by
walking
towards
the
Green
was
the
problem
that
Mr.
Casson
had
been
revolving
in
his
mind
for
the
last
five
minutes
;
but
when
he
had
partly
solved
it
by
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
,
and
thrusting
them
into
the
armholes
of
his
waistcoat
,
by
throwing
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
providing
himself
with
an
air
of
contemptuous
indifference
to
whatever
might
fall
under
his
notice
,
his
thoughts
were
diverted
by
the
approach
of
the
horseman
whom
we
lately
saw
pausing
to
have
another
look
at
our
friend
Adam
,
and
who
now
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
the
Donnithorne
Arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
off
the
bridle
and
give
him
a
drink
,
ostler
,
"
said
the
traveller
to
the
lad
in
a
smock
-
frock
,
who
had
come
out
of
the
yard
at
the
sound
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
up
in
your
pretty
village
,
landlord
?
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
getting
down
.
<EOS>
"
There
seems
to
be
quite
a
stir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
Methodis

preaching

<EOS>
sir
;
it
's
been
gev
hout
as
a
young
woman

going

Green

"
answered
Mr.
Casson
,
in
a
treble
and
wheezy
voice
,
with
a
slightly
mincing
accent
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
please
to
step
in
,

saw
in

about
half
an

before

up

<EOS>
a
carpenter

a

marching

Parson

But
he

a

peppery

<EOS>
"

"
  
<EOS>
The
traveller
put
his
horse
into
a
quick
walk
up
the
village
,
but
when
he
approached
the
Green
,
the
beauty
of
the
view
that
lay
on
his
right
hand
,
the
singular
contrast
presented
by
the
groups
of
villagers
with
the
knot
of
Methodists
near
the
maple
,
and
perhaps
yet
more
,
curiosity
to
see
the
young
female
preacher
,
proved
too
much
for
his
anxiety
to
get
to
the
end
of
his
journey
,
and
he
paused
.
  
<EOS>
The
Green
lay
at
the
extremity
of
the
village
,
and
from
it
the
road
branched
off
in
two
directions
,
one
leading
farther
up
the
hill
by
the
church
,
and
the
other
winding
gently
down
towards
the
valley
.
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
the
Green
that
led
towards
the
church
,
the
broken
line
of
thatched
cottages
was
continued
nearly
to
the
churchyard
gate
;
but
on
the
opposite
northwestern
side
,
there
was
nothing
to
obstruct
the
view
of
gently
swelling
meadow
,
and
wooded
valley
,
and
dark
masses
of
distant
hill
.
<EOS>
That
rich
undulating
district
of
Loamshire
to
which
Hayslope
belonged
lies
close
to
a
grim
outskirt
of
Stonyshire
,
overlooked
by
its
barren
hills
as
a
pretty
blooming
sister
may
sometimes
be
seen
linked
in
the
arm
of
a
rugged
,
tall
,
swarthy
brother
;
and
in
two
or
three
hours
'
ride
the
traveller
might
exchange
a
bleak
treeless
region
,
intersected
by
lines
of
cold
grey
stone
,
for
one
where
his
road
wound
under
the
shelter
of
woods
,
or
up
swelling
hills
,
muffled
with
hedgerows
and
long
meadow
-
grass
and
thick
corn
;
and
where
at
every
turn
he
came
upon
some
fine
old
country
-
seat
nestled
in
the
valley
or
crowning
the
slope
,
some
homestead
with
its
long
length
of
barn
and
its
cluster
of
golden
ricks
,
some
grey
steeple
looking
out
from
a
pretty
confusion
of
trees
and
thatch
and
dark
-
red
tiles
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
such
a
picture
as
this
last
that
Hayslope
Church
had
made
to
the
traveller
as
he
began
to
mount
the
gentle
slope
leading
to
its
pleasant
uplands
,
and
now
from
his
station
near
the
Green
he
had
before
him
in
one
view
<EOS>
nearly
all
the
other
typical
features
of
this
pleasant
land
.
<EOS>
High
up
against
the
horizon
were
the
huge
conical
masses
of
hill
,
like
giant
mounds
intended
to
fortify
this
region
of
corn
and
grass
against
the
keen
and
hungry
winds
of
the
north
;
not
distant
enough
to
be
clothed
in
purple
mystery
,
but
with
sombre
greenish
sides
visibly
specked
with
sheep
,
whose
motion
was
only
revealed
by
memory
,
not
detected
by
sight
;
wooed
from
day
to
day
by
the
changing
hours
,
but
responding
with
no
change
in
themselves
 
left
for
ever
grim
and
sullen
after
the
flush
of
morning
,
the
winged
gleams
of
the
April
noonday
,
the
parting
crimson
glory
of
the
ripening
summer
sun
.
<EOS>
And
directly
below
them
the
eye
rested
on
a
more
advanced
line
of
hanging
woods
,
divided
by
bright
patches
of
pasture
or
furrowed
crops
,
and
not
yet
deepened
into
the
uniform
leafy
curtains
of
high
summer
,
but
still
showing
the
warm
tints
of
the
young
oak
and
the
tender
green
of
the
ash
and
lime
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
valley
,
where
the
woods
grew
thicker
,
as
if
they
had
rolled
down
and
hurried
together
from
the
patches
left
smooth
on
the
slope
,
that
they
might
take
the
better
care
of
the
tall
mansion
which
lifted
its
parapets
and
sent
its
faint
blue
summer
smoke
among
them
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
there
was
a
large
sweep
of
park
and
a
broad
glassy
pool
in
front
of
that
mansion
,
but
the
swelling
slope
of
meadow
would
not
let
our
traveller
see
them
from
the
village
green
.
<EOS>
He
saw
instead
a
foreground
which
was
just
as
lovely
 
<EOS>
the
level
sunlight
lying
like
transparent
gold
among
the
gently
curving
stems
of
the
feathered
grass
and
the
tall
red
sorrel
,
and
the
white
ambels
of
the
hemlocks
lining
the
bushy
hedgerows
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
moment
in
summer
when
the
sound
of
the
scythe
being
whetted
makes
us
cast
more
lingering
looks
at
the
flower
-
sprinkled
tresses
of
the
meadows
.
  
<EOS>
He
might
have
seen
other
beauties
in
the
landscape
if
he
had
turned
a
little
in
his
saddle
and
looked
eastward
,
beyond
Jonathan
Burge
's
pasture
and
woodyard
towards
the
green
corn
-
fields
and
walnut
-
trees
of
the
Hall
Farm
;
but
apparently
there
was
more
interest
for
him
in
the
living
groups
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Every
generation
in
the
village
was
there
,
from
old
"
Feyther
Taft
"
in
his
brown
worsted
night
-
cap
,
who
was
bent
nearly
double
,
but
seemed
tough
enough
to
keep
on
his
legs
a
long
while
,
leaning
on
his
short
stick
,
down
to
the
babies
with
their
little
round
heads
lolling
forward
in
quilted
linen
caps
.
<EOS>
Now
and
then
there
was
a
new
arrival
;
perhaps
a
slouching
labourer
,
who
,
having
eaten
his
supper
,
came
out
to
look
at
the
unusual
scene
with
a
slow
bovine
gaze
,
willing
to
hear
what
any
one
had
to
say
in
explanation
of
it
,
but
by
no
means
excited
enough
to
ask
a
question
.
<EOS>
But
all
took
care
not
to
join
the
Methodists
on
the
Green
,
and
identify
themselves
in
that
way
with
the
expectant
audience
,
for
there
was
not
one
of
them
that
would
not
have
disclaimed
the
imputation
of
having
come
out
to
hear
the
"
preacher
woman
"
 
they
had
only
come
out
to
see
"
what
war
a
-
goin
'
on
,
like
.
<EOS>
"
The
men
were
chiefly
gathered
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
blacksmith
's
shop
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
imagine
them
gathered
in
a
knot
.
<EOS>
Villagers
never
swarm
:
a
whisper
is
unknown
among
them
,
and
they
seem
almost
as
incapable
of
an
undertone
as
a
cow
or
a
stag
.
<EOS>
Your
true
rustic
turns
his
back
on
his
interlocutor
,
throwing
a
question
over
his
shoulder
as
if
he
meant
to
run
away
from
the
answer
,
and
walking
a
step
or
two
farther
off
when
the
interest
of
the
dialogue
culminates
.
<EOS>
So
the
group
in
the
vicinity
of
the
blacksmith
's
door
was
by
no
means
a
close
one
,
and
formed
no
screen
in
front
of
Chad
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
himself
,
who
stood
with
his
black
brawny
arms
folded
,
leaning
against
the
door
-
post
,
and
occasionally
sending
forth
a
bellowing
laugh
at
his
own
jokes
,
giving
them
a
marked
preference
over
the
sarcasms
of
Wiry
Ben
,
who
had
renounced
the
pleasures
of
the
Holly
Bush
for
the
sake
of
seeing
life
under
a
new
form
.
<EOS>
But
both
styles
of
wit
were
treated
with
equal
contempt
by
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rann
's
leathern
apron
and
subdued
griminess
can
leave
no
one
in
any
doubt
that
he
is
the
village
shoemaker
;
<EOS>
the
thrusting
out
of
his
chin
and
stomach
and
the
twirling
of
his
thumbs
are
more
subtle
indications
,
intended
to
prepare
unwary
strangers
for
the
discovery
that
they
are
in
the
presence
of
the
parish
clerk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Old
Joshway
,
"
as
he
is
irreverently
called
by
his
neighbours
,
is
in
a
state
of
simmering
indignation
;
but
he
has
not
yet
opened
his
lips
except
to
say
,
in
a
resounding
bass
undertone
,
like
the
tuning
of
a
violoncello
,
"
Sehon
,
King
of
the
Amorites
;
for
His
mercy
endureth
for
ever
;
and
Og
the
King
of
Basan
:
for
His
mercy
endureth
for
ever
"
 
a
quotation
which
may
seem
to
have
slight
bearing
on
the
present
occasion
,
but
,
as
with
every
other
anomaly
,
adequate
knowledge
will
show
it
to
be
a
natural
sequence
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rann
was
inwardly
maintaining
the
dignity
of
the
Church
in
the
face
of
this
scandalous
irruption
of
Methodism
,
and
as
that
dignity
was
bound
up
with
his
own
sonorous
utterance
of
the
responses
,
his
argument
naturally
suggested
a
quotation
from
the
psalm
he
had
read
the
last
Sunday
afternoon
.
  
<EOS>
The
stronger
curiosity
of
the
women
had
drawn
them
quite
to
the
edge
of
the
Green
,
where
they
could
examine
more
closely
the
Quakerlike
costume
and
odd
deportment
of
the
female
Methodists
.
<EOS>
Underneath
the
maple
there
was
a
small
cart
,
which
had
been
brought
from
the
wheelwright
's
to
serve
as
a
pulpit
,
and
round
this
a
couple
of
benches
and
a
few
chairs
had
been
placed
.
<EOS>
Some
of
the
Methodists
were
resting
on
these
,
with
their
eyes
closed
,
as
if
wrapt
in
prayer
or
meditation
.
<EOS>
Others
chose
to
continue
standing
,
and
had
turned
their
faces
towards
the
villagers
with
a
look
of
melancholy
compassion
,
which
was
highly
amusing
to
Bessy
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
's
buxom
daughter
,
known
to
her
neighbours
as
Chad
's
Bess
,
who
wondered
"
why
the
folks
war
amakin
'
faces
a
that'ns
.
<EOS>
"
Chad
's
Bess
was
the
object
of
peculiar
compassion
,
because
her
hair
,
being
turned
back
under
a
cap
which
was
set
at
the
top
of
her
head
,
exposed
to
view
an
ornament
of
which
she
was
much
prouder
than
of
her
red
cheeks
 
namely
,
a
pair
of
large
round
ear
-
rings
with
false
garnets
in
them
,
ornaments
condemned
not
only
by
the
Methodists
,
but
by
her
own
cousin
and
namesake
Timothy
's
Bess
,
who
,
with
much
cousinly
feeling
,
often
wished
<EOS>
"
them
ear
-
rings
"
might
come
to
good
.
  
<EOS>
Timothy
's
Bess
,
though
retaining
her
maiden
appellation
among
her
familiars
,
had
long
been
the
wife
of
Sandy
Jim
,
and
possessed
a
handsome
set
of
matronly
jewels
,
of
which
it
is
enough
to
mention
the
heavy
baby
she
was
rocking
in
her
arms
,
and
the
sturdy
fellow
of
five
in
knee
-
breeches
,
and
red
legs
,
who
had
a
rusty
milk
-
can
round
his
neck
by
way
of
drum
,
and
was
very
carefully
avoided
by
Chad
's
small
terrier
.
<EOS>
This
young
olive
-
branch
,
notorious
under
the
name
of
Timothy
's
Bess
's
Ben
,
being
of
an
inquiring
disposition
,
unchecked
by
any
false
modesty
,
had
advanced
beyond
the
group
of
women
and
children
,
and
was
walking
round
the
Methodists
,
looking
up
in
their
faces
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
beating
his
stick
against
the
milk
-
can
by
way
of
musical
accompaniment
.
<EOS>
But
one
of
the
elderly
women
bending
down
to
take
him
by
the
shoulder
,
with
an
air
of
grave
remonstrance
,
Timothy
's
Bess
's
Ben
first
kicked
out
vigorously
,
then
took
to
his
heels
and
sought
refuge
behind
his
father
's
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ye

said
Sandy
Jim
,
with
some
paternal
pride
,
"

continued
,
as

sauntered
up
towards
the

said
Mr.

,
with
some
dignity
;
"

Mr.

with
a
long
treble
intonation
,
"

<EOS>
I
mun

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Several
of
the
men
followed
Ben
's
lead
,
and
the
traveller
pushed
his
horse
on
to
the
Green
,
as
Dinah
walked
rather
quickly
and
in
advance
of
her
companions
towards
the
cart
under
the
maple
-
tree
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
near
Seth
's
tall
figure
,
she
looked
short
,
but
when
she
had
mounted
the
cart
,
and
was
away
from
all
comparison
,
she
seemed
above
the
middle
height
of
woman
,
though
in
reality
she
did
not
exceed
it
 
an
effect
which
was
due
to
the
slimness
of
her
figure
and
the
simple
line
of
her
black
stuff
dress
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
was
struck
with
surprise
as
he
saw
her
approach
and
mount
the
cart
 
surprise
,
not
so
much
at
the
feminine
delicacy
of
her
appearance
,
as
at
the
total
absence
of
self
-
consciousness
in
her
demeanour
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
up
his
mind
to
see
her
advance
with
a
measured
step
and
a
demure
solemnity
of
countenance
;
he
had
felt
sure
that
her
face
would
be
mantled
with
the
smile
of
conscious
saintship
,
or
else
charged
with
denunciatory
bitterness
.
<EOS>
He
knew
but
two
types
of
Methodist
 
the
ecstatic
and
the
bilious
.
<EOS>
But
Dinah
walked
as
simply
as
if
she
were
going
to
market
,
and
seemed
as
unconscious
of
her
outward
appearance
as
a
little
boy
:
there
was
no
blush
,
no
tremulousness
,
which
said
,
"
I
know
you
think
me
a
pretty
woman
,
too
young
to
preach
"
;
no
casting
up
or
down
of
the
eyelids
,
no
compression
of
the
lips
,
no
attitude
of
the
arms
that
said
,
"
But
you
must
think
of
me
as
a
saint
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
held
no
book
in
her
ungloved
hands
,
but
let
them
hang
down
lightly
crossed
before
her
,
as
she
stood
and
turned
her
grey
eyes
on
the
people
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
keenness
in
the
eyes
;
they
seemed
rather
to
be
shedding
love
than
making
observations
;
they
had
the
liquid
look
which
tells
that
the
mind
is
full
of
what
it
has
to
give
out
,
rather
than
impressed
by
external
objects
.
<EOS>
She
stood
with
her
left
hand
towards
the
descending
sun
,
and
leafy
boughs
screened
her
from
its
rays
;
but
in
this
sober
light
the
delicate
colouring
of
her
face
seemed
to
gather
a
calm
vividness
,
like
flowers
at
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
oval
face
,
of
a
uniform
transparent
whiteness
,
with
an
egg
-
like
line
of
cheek
and
chin
,
a
full
but
firm
mouth
,
a
delicate
nostril
,
and
a
low
perpendicular
brow
,
surmounted
by
a
rising
arch
of
parting
between
smooth
locks
of
pale
reddish
hair
.
<EOS>
The
hair
was
drawn
straight
back
behind
the
ears
,
and
covered
,
except
for
an
inch
or
two
above
the
brow
,
by
a
net
Quaker
cap
.
<EOS>
The
eyebrows
,
of
the
same
colour
as
the
hair
,
were
perfectly
horizontal
and
firmly
pencilled
;
the
eyelashes
,
though
no
darker
,
were
long
and
abundant
 
<EOS>
nothing
was
left
blurred
or
unfinished
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
faces
that
make
one
think
of
white
flowers
with
light
touches
of
colour
on
their
pure
petals
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
had
no
peculiar
beauty
,
beyond
that
of
expression
;
they
looked
so
simple
,
so
candid
,
so
gravely
loving
,
that
no
accusing
scowl
,
no
light
sneer
could
help
melting
away
before
their
glance
.
<EOS>
Joshua
Rann
gave
a
long
cough
,
as
if
he
were
clearing
his
throat
in
order
to
come
to
a
new
understanding
with
himself
;
Chad
Cranage
lifted
up
his
leather
skull
-
cap
and
scratched
his
head
;
and
Wiry
Ben
wondered
how
Seth
had
the
pluck
to
think
of
courting
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
sweet
woman
,
"
the
stranger
said
to
himself
,
"
but
surely
nature
never
meant
her
for
a
preacher
.
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
was
one
of
those
who
think
that
nature
has
theatrical
properties
and
,
with
the
considerate
view
of
facilitating
art
and
psychology
,
"
makes
up
,
"
her
characters
,
so
that
there
may
be
no
mistake
about
them
.
<EOS>
But
Dinah
began
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friends
,
"
she
said
in
a
clear
but
not
loud
voice
"
let
us
pray
for
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
closed
her
eyes
,
and
hanging
her
head
down
a
little
continued
in
the
same
moderate
tone
,
as
if
speaking
to
some
one
quite
near
her
:
"
Saviour
of
sinners
!
<EOS>
When
a
poor
woman
laden
with
sins
,
went
out
to
the
well
to
draw
water
,
she
found
Thee
sitting
at
the
well
.
<EOS>
She
knew
Thee
<EOS>
not
<EOS>
;
she
had
not
sought
Thee
;
her
mind
was
dark
;
her
life
was
unholy
.
<EOS>
But
Thou
didst
speak
to
her
,
Thou
didst
teach
her
,
Thou
didst
show
her
that
her
life
lay
open
before
Thee
,
and
yet
Thou
wast
ready
to
give
her
that
blessing
which
she
had
never
sought
.
<EOS>
Jesus
,
Thou
art
in
the
midst
of
us
,
and
Thou
knowest
all
men
:
if
there
is
any
here
like
that
poor
woman
 
if
their
minds
are
dark
,
their
lives
unholy
 
if
they
have
come
out
not
seeking
Thee
,
not
desiring
to
be
taught
;
deal
with
them
according
to
the
free
mercy
which
Thou
didst
show
to
her
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
them
,
Lord
,
open
their
ears
to
my
message
,
bring
their
sins
to
their
minds
,
and
make
them
thirst
for
that
salvation
which
Thou
art
ready
to
give
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Thou
art
with
Thy
people
still
:
they
see
Thee
in
the
night
-
watches
,
and
their
hearts
burn
within
them
as
Thou
talkest
with
them
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
And
Thou
art
near
to
those
who
have
not
known
Thee
:
open
their
eyes
that
they
may
see
Thee
 
see
Thee
weeping
over
them
,
and
saying
'
Ye
will
not
come
unto
me
that
ye
might
have
life
'
 
see
Thee
hanging
on
the
cross
and
saying
,
'
Father
,
forgive
them
,
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
'
 
see
Thee
<EOS>
as
Thou
wilt
come
again
in
Thy
glory
to
judge
them
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
Amen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
opened
her
eyes
again
and
paused
,
looking
at
the
group
of
villagers
,
who
were
now
gathered
rather
more
closely
on
her
right
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friends
,
"
she
began
,
raising
her
voice
a
little
,
"
you
have
<EOS>
all
of
you
been
to
church
,
and
I
think
you
must
have
heard
the
clergyman
read
these
words
:
"
The
Spirit
of
the
Lord
is
upon
me
,
because
he
hath
anointed
me
to
preach
the
gospel
to
the
poor
.
"
<EOS>
Jesus
Christ
spoke
those
words
 
<EOS>
he
said
he
came
TO
PREACH
THE
GOSPEL
<EOS>
TO
THE
POOR
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
you
ever
thought
about
those
words
much
,
but
I
will
tell
you
when
I
remember
first
hearing
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
on
just
such
a
sort
of
evening
as
this
,
when
I
was
a
little
girl
,
and
my
aunt
as
brought
me
up
took
me
to
hear
a
good
man
preach
out
of
doors
,
just
as
we
are
here
.
<EOS>
I
remember
his
face
well
<EOS>
:
he
was
a
very
old
man
,
and
had
very
long
white
hair
;
his
voice
was
very
soft
and
beautiful
,
not
like
any
voice
I
had
ever
heard
before
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
little
girl
and
scarcely
knew
anything
,
and
this
old
man
seemed
to
me
such
a
different
sort
of
a
man
from
anybody
<EOS>
I
had
ever
seen
before
that
<EOS>
I
thought
he
had
perhaps
come
down
from
the
sky
to
preach
to
us
,
and
I
said
,
"
Aunt
,
will
he
go
back
to
the
sky
to
-
night
,
like
the
picture
in
the
Bible
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
man
of
God
was
Mr.
Wesley
,
who
spent
his
life
in
doing
what
our
blessed
Lord
did
 
preaching
the
Gospel
to
the
poor
 
<EOS>
and
he
entered
into
his
rest
eight
years
ago
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
know
more
about
him
years
after
,
but
I
was
a
foolish
thoughtless
child
then
,
and
I
remembered
only
one
thing
he
told
us
in
his
sermon
.
<EOS>
He
told
us
as
"
Gospel
"
meant
"
good
news
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Gospel
,
you
know
,
is
what
the
Bible
tells
us
about
God
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
that
now
!
<EOS>
Jesus
Christ
did
really
come
down
from
heaven
,
as
I
,
like
a
silly
child
,
thought
Mr.
Wesley
did
;
and
what
he
came
down
for
was
to
tell
good
news
about
God
to
the
poor
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
and
me
,
dear
friends
,
are
poor
.
<EOS>
We
have
been
brought
up
in
poor
cottages
and
have
been
reared
on
oat
-
cake
,
and
lived
coarse
;
and
we
have
n't
been
to
school
much
,
nor
read
books
,
and
we
do
n't
know
much
about
anything
<EOS>
but
what
happens
just
round
us
.
<EOS>
We
are
just
the
sort
of
people
that
want
to
hear
good
news
.
<EOS>
For
when
anybody
's
well
off
,
they
do
n't
much
mind
about
hearing
news
from
distant
parts
;
but
if
a
poor
man
or
woman
's
in
trouble
and
has
hard
work
to
make
out
a
living
,
they
like
to
have
a
letter
to
tell
'em
they
've
got
a
friend
as
will
help
'em
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
we
ca
n't
help
knowing
something
about
God
,
even
if
we
've
never
heard
the
Gospel
,
the
good
news
that
our
Saviour
brought
us
.
<EOS>
For
we
know
everything
comes
from
God
:
do
n't
you
say
almost
every
day
,
"
This
and
that
will
happen
,
please
God
,
"
and
<EOS>
"
We
shall
begin
to
cut
the
grass
soon
,
please
God
to
send
us
a
little
more
sunshine
"
?
<EOS>
We
know
very
well
we
are
altogether
in
the
hands
of
God
.
<EOS>
We
did
n't
bring
ourselves
into
the
world
,
we
ca
n't
keep
ourselves
alive
while
we
're
sleeping
;
the
daylight
,
and
the
wind
,
and
the
corn
,
and
the
cows
to
give
us
milk
 
<EOS>
everything
we
have
comes
from
God
.
<EOS>
And
he
gave
us
our
souls
and
put
love
between
parents
and
children
,
and
husband
and
wife
.
<EOS>
But
is
that
as
much
as
we
want
to
know
about
God
?
<EOS>
We
see
he
is
great
and
mighty
,
and
can
do
what
he
will
:
we
are
lost
,
as
if
we
was
struggling
in
great
waters
,
when
we
try
to
think
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
perhaps
doubts
come
into
your
mind
like
this
:
Can
God
take
much
notice
of
us
poor
people
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
only
made
the
world
for
the
great
and
the
wise
and
the
rich
.
<EOS>
It
does
n't
cost
him
much
to
give
us
our
little
handful
of
victual
and
bit
of
clothing
;
but
how
do
we
know
he
cares
for
us
any
more
than
we
care
for
the
worms
and
things
in
the
garden
,
so
as
we
rear
our
carrots
and
onions
?
<EOS>
Will
God
take
care
of
us
when
we
die
?
<EOS>
And
has
he
any
comfort
for
us
when
we
are
lame
and
sick
and
helpless
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
too
,
he
is
angry
with
us
;
else
why
does
the
blight
come
,
and
the
bad
harvests
,
and
the
fever
,
and
all
sorts
of
pain
and
trouble
?
<EOS>
For
our
life
is
full
of
trouble
,
and
if
God
sends
us
good
,
he
seems
to
send
bad
too
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
?
<EOS>
How
is
it
?
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
dear
friends
,
we
are
in
sad
want
of
good
news
about
God
;
and
what
does
other
good
news
signify
if
we
have
n't
that
?
<EOS>
For
everything
else
comes
to
an
end
,
and
when
we
die
we
leave
it
all
.
<EOS>
But
God
lasts
when
everything
else
is
gone
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
do
if
he
is
not
our
friend
?
"
  
<EOS>
Then
Dinah
told
how
the
good
news
had
been
brought
,
and
how
the
mind
of
God
towards
the
poor
had
been
made
manifest
in
the
life
of
Jesus
,
dwelling
on
its
lowliness
and
its
acts
of
mercy
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
see
,
dear
friends
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
Jesus
spent
his
time
almost
all
in
doing
good
to
poor
people
;
he
preached
out
of
doors
to
them
,
and
he
made
friends
of
poor
workmen
,
and
taught
them
and
took
pains
with
them
.
<EOS>
Not
but
what
he
did
good
to
the
rich
too
,
for
he
was
full
of
love
to
all
men
,
only
he
saw
as
the
poor
were
more
in
want
of
his
help
.
<EOS>
So
he
cured
the
lame
and
the
sick
and
the
blind
,
and
he
worked
miracles
to
feed
the
hungry
because
,
he
said
,
he
was
sorry
for
them
;
and
he
was
very
kind
to
the
little
children
and
comforted
those
who
had
lost
their
friends
;
and
he
spoke
very
tenderly
to
poor
sinners
that
were
sorry
for
their
sins
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
would
n't
you
love
such
a
man
if
you
saw
him
 
if
he
were
here
in
this
village
?
<EOS>
What
a
kind
heart
he
must
have
!
<EOS>
What
a
friend
he
would
be
to
go
to
in
trouble
!
<EOS>
How
pleasant
it
must
be
to
be
taught
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
dear
friends
,
who
WAS
this
man
?
<EOS>
Was
he
only
a
good
man
 
a
very
good
man
,
and
no
more
 
like
our
dear
Mr.
Wesley
,
who
has
been
taken
from
us?
...
<EOS>
He
was
the
Son
of
God
 
"
in
the
image
of
the
Father
,
"
the
Bible
says
;
<EOS>
that
means
,
just
like
God
,
who
is
the
beginning
and
end
of
all
things
 
<EOS>
the
God
we
want
to
know
about
.
<EOS>
So
then
,
all
the
love
that
Jesus
showed
to
the
poor
is
the
same
love
that
God
has
for
us
.
<EOS>
We
can
understand
what
Jesus
felt
,
because
he
came
in
a
body
like
ours
and
spoke
words
such
as
we
speak
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
We
were
afraid
to
think
what
God
was
before
 
<EOS>
the
God
who
made
the
world
and
the
sky
and
the
thunder
and
lightning
.
<EOS>
We
could
never
see
him
;
we
could
only
see
the
things
he
had
made
;
and
some
of
these
things
was
very
terrible
,
so
as
we
might
well
tremble
when
we
thought
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
our
blessed
Saviour
has
showed
us
what
God
is
in
a
way
us
poor
ignorant
people
can
understand
;
he
has
showed
us
what
God
's
heart
is
,
what
are
his
feelings
towards
us
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
let
us
see
a
little
more
about
what
Jesus
came
on
earth
for
.
<EOS>
Another
time
he
said
,
"
I
came
to
seek
and
to
save
that
which
was
lost
"
;
and
another
time
,
"
I
came
not
to
call
the
righteous
but
sinners
to
repentance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
LOST!
...
<EOS>
SINNERS!
...
<EOS>
Ah
,
dear
friends
,
does
that
mean
you
and
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
the
traveller
had
been
chained
to
the
spot
against
his
will
by
the
charm
of
Dinah
's
mellow
treble
tones
,
which
had
a
variety
of
modulation
like
that
of
a
fine
instrument
touched
with
the
unconscious
skill
of
musical
instinct
.
<EOS>
The
simple
things
she
said
seemed
like
novelties
,
as
a
melody
strikes
us
with
a
new
feeling
when
we
hear
it
sung
by
the
pure
voice
of
a
boyish
chorister
;
the
quiet
depth
of
conviction
with
which
she
spoke
seemed
in
itself
an
evidence
for
the
truth
of
her
message
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
she
had
thoroughly
arrested
her
hearers
.
<EOS>
The
villagers
had
pressed
nearer
to
her
,
and
there
was
no
longer
anything
but
grave
attention
on
all
faces
.
<EOS>
She
spoke
slowly
,
though
quite
fluently
,
often
pausing
after
a
question
,
or
before
any
transition
of
ideas
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
change
of
attitude
,
no
gesture
;
the
effect
of
her
speech
was
produced
entirely
by
the
inflections
of
her
voice
,
and
when
she
came
to
the
question
,
"
Will
God
take
care
of
us
when
we
die
?
<EOS>
"
she
uttered
it
in
such
a
tone
of
plaintive
appeal
that
the
tears
came
into
some
of
the
hardest
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
had
ceased
to
doubt
,
as
he
had
done
at
the
first
glance
,
that
she
could
fix
the
attention
of
her
rougher
hearers
,
but
still
he
wondered
whether
she
could
have
that
power
of
rousing
their
more
violent
emotions
,
which
must
surely
be
a
necessary
seal
of
her
vocation
as
a
Methodist
preacher
,
until
she
came
to
the
words
,
"
Lost
!
 
<EOS>
Sinners
!
<EOS>
"
when
there
was
a
great
change
in
her
voice
and
manner
.
<EOS>
She
had
made
a
long
pause
before
the
exclamation
,
and
the
pause
seemed
to
be
filled
by
agitating
thoughts
that
showed
themselves
in
her
features
.
<EOS>
Her
pale
face
became
paler
;
the
circles
under
her
eyes
deepened
,
as
they
did
when
tears
half
-
gather
without
falling
;
and
the
mild
loving
eyes
took
an
expression
of
appalled
pity
,
as
if
she
had
suddenly
discerned
a
destroying
angel
hovering
over
the
heads
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
Her
voice
became
deep
and
muffled
,
but
there
was
still
no
gesture
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
less
like
the
ordinary
type
of
the
Ranter
than
Dinah
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
preaching
as
she
heard
others
preach
,
but
speaking
directly
from
her
own
emotions
and
under
the
inspiration
of
her
own
simple
faith
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
she
had
entered
into
a
new
current
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
became
less
calm
,
her
utterance
more
rapid
and
agitated
,
as
she
tried
to
bring
home
to
the
people
their
guilt
,
their
wilful
darkness
,
their
state
of
disobedience
to
God
 
as
she
dwelt
on
the
hatefulness
of
sin
,
the
Divine
holiness
,
and
the
sufferings
of
the
Saviour
,
by
which
a
way
had
been
opened
for
their
salvation
.
<EOS>
At
last
it
seemed
as
if
,
in
her
yearning
desire
to
reclaim
the
lost
sheep
,
she
could
not
be
satisfied
by
addressing
her
hearers
as
a
body
.
<EOS>
She
appealed
first
to
one
and
then
to
another
,
beseeching
them
with
tears
to
turn
to
God
while
there
was
yet
time
;
painting
to
them
the
desolation
of
their
souls
,
lost
in
sin
,
feeding
on
the
husks
of
this
miserable
world
,
far
away
from
God
their
Father
;
and
then
the
love
of
the
Saviour
,
who
was
waiting
and
watching
for
their
return
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
many
a
responsive
sigh
and
groan
from
her
fellow
-
Methodists
,
but
the
village
mind
does
not
easily
take
fire
,
and
a
little
smouldering
vague
anxiety
that
might
easily
die
out
again
was
the
utmost
effect
Dinah
's
preaching
had
wrought
in
them
at
present
.
<EOS>
Yet
no
one
had
retired
,
except
the
children
and
"
old
Feyther
Taft
,
"
who
being
too
deaf
to
catch
many
words
,
had
some
time
ago
gone
back
to
his
inglenook
.
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
was
feeling
very
uncomfortable
,
and
almost
wishing
he
had
not
come
to
hear
Dinah
;
he
thought
what
she
said
would
haunt
him
somehow
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
could
n't
help
liking
to
look
at
her
and
listen
to
her
,
though
he
dreaded
every
moment
that
she
would
fix
her
eyes
on
him
and
address
him
in
particular
.
<EOS>
She
had
already
addressed
Sandy
Jim
,
who
was
now
holding
the
baby
to
relieve
his
wife
,
and
the
big
soft
-
hearted
man
had
rubbed
away
some
tears
with
his
fist
,
with
a
confused
intention
of
being
a
better
fellow
,
going
less
to
the
Holly
Bush
down
by
the
Stone
-
pits
,
and
cleaning
himself
more
regularly
of
a
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
In
front
of
Sandy
Jim
stood
Chad
's
Bess
,
who
had
shown
an
unwonted
quietude
and
fixity
of
attention
ever
since
Dinah
had
begun
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Not
that
the
matter
of
the
discourse
had
arrested
her
at
once
,
for
she
was
lost
in
a
puzzling
speculation
as
to
what
pleasure
and
satisfaction
there
could
be
in
life
to
a
young
woman
who
wore
a
cap
like
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
Giving
up
this
inquiry
in
despair
,
she
took
to
studying
Dinah
's
nose
,
eyes
,
mouth
,
and
hair
,
and
wondering
whether
it
was
better
to
have
such
a
sort
of
pale
face
as
that
,
or
fat
red
cheeks
and
round
black
eyes
like
her
own
.
<EOS>
But
gradually
the
influence
of
the
general
gravity
told
upon
her
,
and
she
became
conscious
of
what
Dinah
was
saying
.
<EOS>
The
gentle
tones
,
the
loving
persuasion
,
did
not
touch
her
,
but
when
the
more
severe
appeals
came
she
began
to
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
Poor
Bessy
had
always
been
considered
a
naughty
girl
;
she
was
conscious
of
it
;
if
it
was
necessary
to
be
very
good
,
it
was
clear
she
must
be
in
a
bad
way
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
find
her
places
at
church
as
Sally
Rann
could
,
she
had
often
been
tittering
when
she
"
curcheyed
"
to
Mr.
Irwine
;
and
these
religious
deficiencies
were
accompanied
by
a
corresponding
slackness
in
the
minor
morals
,
for
Bessy
belonged
unquestionably
to
that
unsoaped
lazy
class
of
feminine
characters
with
whom
you
may
venture
to
"
eat
an
egg
,
an
apple
,
or
a
nut
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
this
she
was
generally
conscious
of
,
and
hitherto
had
not
been
greatly
ashamed
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
began
to
feel
very
much
as
if
the
constable
had
come
to
take
her
up
and
carry
her
before
the
justice
for
some
undefined
offence
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
terrified
sense
that
God
,
whom
she
had
always
thought
of
as
very
far
off
,
was
very
near
to
her
,
and
that
Jesus
was
close
by
looking
at
her
,
though
she
could
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
For
Dinah
had
that
belief
in
visible
manifestations
of
Jesus
,
which
is
common
among
the
Methodists
,
and
she
communicated
it
irresistibly
to
her
hearers
<EOS>
:
she
made
them
feel
that
he
was
among
them
bodily
,
and
might
at
any
moment
show
himself
to
them
in
some
way
that
would
strike
anguish
and
penitence
into
their
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
turning
to
the
left
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
a
point
above
the
heads
of
the
people
.
"
<EOS>
See
where
our
blessed
Lord
stands
and
weeps
and
stretches
out
his
arms
towards
you
.
<EOS>
Hear
what
he
says
:
"
How
often
would
I
have
gathered
you
as
a
hen
gathereth
her
chickens
under
her
wings
,
and
ye
would
not!"
...
and
ye
would
not
,
"
she
repeated
,
in
a
tone
of
pleading
reproach
,
turning
her
eyes
on
the
people
again
.
"
<EOS>
See
the
print
of
the
nails
on
his
dear
hands
and
feet
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
sins
that
made
them
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
How
pale
and
worn
he
looks
!
<EOS>
He
has
gone
through
all
that
great
agony
in
the
garden
,
when
his
soul
was
exceeding
sorrowful
even
unto
death
,
and
the
great
drops
of
sweat
fell
like
blood
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
They
spat
upon
him
and
buffeted
him
,
they
scourged
him
,
they
mocked
him
,
they
laid
the
heavy
cross
on
his
bruised
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Then
they
nailed
him
up
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
pain
!
<EOS>
His
lips
are
parched
with
thirst
,
and
they
mock
him
still
in
this
great
agony
;
yet
with
those
parched
lips
he
prays
for
them
,
"
Father
,
forgive
them
,
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
.
"
<EOS>
Then
a
horror
of
great
darkness
fell
upon
him
,
and
he
felt
what
sinners
feel
when
they
are
for
ever
shut
out
from
God
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
last
drop
in
the
cup
of
bitterness
.
<EOS>
"
My
God
,
my
God
!
"
he
cries
,
"
why
hast
Thou
forsaken
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
All
this
he
bore
for
you
!
<EOS>
For
you
 
<EOS>
and
you
never
think
of
him
;
for
you
 
<EOS>
and
you
turn
your
backs
on
him
;
you
do
n't
care
what
he
has
gone
through
for
you
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
is
not
weary
of
toiling
for
you
:
he
has
risen
from
the
dead
,
he
is
praying
for
you
at
the
right
hand
of
God
 
"
Father
,
forgive
them
,
for
they
know
not
what
they
do
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
is
upon
this
earth
too
;
he
is
among
us
;
he
is
there
close
to
you
now
;
I
see
his
wounded
body
and
his
look
of
love
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Dinah
turned
to
Bessy
Cranage
,
whose
bonny
youth
and
evident
vanity
had
touched
her
with
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
child
!
<EOS>
Poor
child
!
<EOS>
He
is
beseeching
you
,
and
you
do
n't
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
You
think
of
ear
-
rings
and
fine
gowns
and
caps
,
and
you
never
think
of
the
Saviour
who
died
to
save
your
precious
soul
.
<EOS>
Your
cheeks
will
be
shrivelled
one
day
,
your
hair
will
be
grey
,
your
poor
body
will
be
thin
and
tottering
!
<EOS>
Then
you
will
begin
to
feel
that
your
soul
is
not
saved
;
then
you
will
have
to
stand
before
God
dressed
in
your
sins
,
in
your
evil
tempers
and
vain
thoughts
.
<EOS>
And
Jesus
,
who
stands
ready
to
help
you
now
,
wo
n't
help
you
then
;
because
you
wo
n't
have
him
to
be
your
Saviour
,
he
will
be
your
judge
.
<EOS>
Now
he
looks
at
you
with
love
and
mercy
and
says
,
"
Come
to
me
that
you
may
have
life
"
;
then
he
will
turn
away
from
you
,
and
say
,
"
Depart
from
me
into
ever
-
lasting
fire
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
Poor
Bessy
's
wide
-
open
black
eyes
began
to
fill
with
tears
,
her
great
red
cheeks
and
lips
became
quite
pale
,
and
her
face
was
distorted
like
a
little
child
's
before
a
burst
of
crying
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
poor
blind
child
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dinah
went
on
,
"
think
if
it
should
happen
to
you
as
it
once
happened
to
a
servant
of
God
in
the
days
of
her
vanity
.
<EOS>
SHE
thought
of
her
lace
caps
and
saved
all
her
money
to
buy
'em
;
she
thought
nothing
about
how
she
might
get
a
clean
heart
and
a
right
spirit
 
she
only
wanted
to
have
better
lace
than
other
girls
.
<EOS>
And
one
day
when
she
put
her
new
cap
on
and
looked
in
the
glass
,
she
saw
a
bleeding
Face
crowned
with
thorns
.
<EOS>
That
face
is
looking
at
you
now
"
 
here
<EOS>
Dinah
pointed
to
a
spot
close
in
front
of
Bessy
 
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
tear
off
those
follies
!
<EOS>
Cast
them
away
from
you
,
as
if
they
were
stinging
adders
.
<EOS>
They
ARE
stinging
you
 
they
are
poisoning
your
soul
 
they
are
dragging
you
down
into
a
dark
bottomless
pit
,
where
you
will
sink
for
ever
,
and
for
ever
,
and
for
ever
,
further
away
from
light
and
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bessy
could
bear
it
no
longer
:
a
great
terror
was
upon
her
,
and
wrenching
her
ear
-
rings
from
her
ears
,
she
threw
them
down
before
her
,
sobbing
aloud
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
Chad
,
frightened
lest
he
should
be
"
laid
hold
on
"
too
,
this
impression
on
the
rebellious
Bess
striking
him
as
nothing
less
than
a
miracle
,
walked
hastily
away
and
began
to
work
at
his
anvil
by
way
of
reassuring
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Folks
mun

<EOS>
me
for
that
<EOS>
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
Dinah
began
to
tell
of
the
joys
that
were
in
store
for
the
penitent
,
and
to
describe
in
her
simple
way
the
divine
peace
and
love
with
which
the
soul
of
the
believer
is
filled
 
how
the
sense
of
God
's
love
turns
poverty
into
riches
and
satisfies
the
soul
so
that
no
uneasy
desire
vexes
it
<EOS>
,
no
fear
alarms
it
:
how
,
at
last
,
the
very
temptation
to
sin
is
extinguished
,
and
heaven
is
begun
upon
earth
,
because
no
cloud
passes
between
the
soul
and
God
,
who
is
its
eternal
sun
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friends
,
"
she
said
at
last
,
"
brothers
and
sisters
,
whom
I
love
as
those
for
whom
my
Lord
has
died
,
believe
me
,
I
know
what
this
great
blessedness
is
;
and
because
I
know
it
,
I
want
you
to
have
it
too
.
<EOS>
I
am
poor
,
like
you
:
I
have
to
get
my
living
with
my
hands
;
but
no
lord
nor
lady
can
be
so
happy
as
me
,
if
they
have
n't
got
the
love
of
God
in
their
souls
.
<EOS>
Think
what
it
is
 
not
to
hate
anything
but
sin
;
to
be
full
of
love
to
every
creature
;
to
be
frightened
at
nothing
;
to
be
sure
that
all
things
will
turn
to
good
;
not
to
mind
pain
,
because
it
is
our
Father
's
will
;
to
know
that
nothing
 
<EOS>
no
,
not
if
the
earth
was
to
be
burnt
up
,
or
the
waters
come
and
drown
us
 
nothing
could
part
us
from
God
who
loves
us
,
and
who
fills
our
souls
with
peace
and
joy
,
because
we
are
sure
that
whatever
he
wills
is
holy
,
just
,
and
good
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friends
,
come
and
take
this
blessedness
;
it
is
offered
to
you
;
it
is
the
good
news
that
Jesus
came
to
preach
to
the
poor
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
like
the
riches
of
this
world
,
so
that
the
more
one
gets
the
less
the
rest
can
have
.
<EOS>
God
is
without
end
;
his
love
is
without
end
 
<EOS>
"
       
Its
streams
the
whole
creation
reach
,
     
<EOS>
So
plenteous
is
the
store
;
     
Enough
for
all
,
enough
for
each
,
     
Enough
for
evermore
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
had
been
speaking
at
least
an
hour
,
and
the
reddening
light
of
the
parting
day
seemed
to
give
a
solemn
emphasis
to
her
closing
words
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
who
had
been
interested
in
the
course
of
her
sermon
as
if
it
had
been
the
development
of
a
drama
 
for
there
is
this
sort
of
fascination
in
all
sincere
unpremeditated
eloquence
,
which
opens
to
one
the
inward
drama
of
the
speaker
's
emotions
 
now
turned
his
horse
aside
and
pursued
his
way
,
while
Dinah
said
,
"
Let
us
sing
a
little
,
dear
friends
"
;
and
as
he
was
still
winding
down
the
slope
,
the
voices
of
the
Methodists
reached
him
,
rising
and
falling
in
that
strange
blending
of
exultation
and
sadness
which
belongs
to
the
cadence
of
a
hymn
.
    
<EOS>
After
the
Preaching
  
IN
less
than
an
hour
from
that
time
,
Seth
Bede
was
walking
by
Dinah
's
side
along
the
hedgerow
-
path
that
skirted
the
pastures
and
green
corn
-
fields
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
Dinah
had
taken
off
her
little
Quaker
bonnet
again
,
and
was
holding
it
in
her
hands
that
she
might
have
a
freer
enjoyment
of
the
cool
evening
twilight
,
and
Seth
could
see
the
expression
of
her
face
quite
clearly
as
he
walked
by
her
side
,
timidly
revolving
something
he
wanted
to
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
expression
of
unconscious
placid
gravity
 
of
absorption
in
thoughts
that
had
no
connection
with
the
present
moment
or
with
her
own
personality
 
an
expression
that
is
most
of
all
discouraging
to
a
lover
.
<EOS>
Her
very
walk
was
discouraging
:
it
had
that
quiet
elasticity
that
asks
for
no
support
.
<EOS>
Seth
felt
this
dimly
;
he
said
to
himself
,
"
She
's
too
good
and
holy
for
any
man
,
let
alone
me
,
"
and
the
words
he
had
been
summoning
rushed
back
again
before
they
had
reached
his
lips
.
<EOS>
But
another
thought
gave
him
courage
:
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
man
could
love
her
better
and
leave
her
freer
to
follow
the
Lord
's
work
.
<EOS>
"
They
had
been
silent
for
many
minutes
now
,
since
they
had
done
talking
about
Bessy
Cranage
;
Dinah
seemed
almost
to
have
forgotten
Seth
's
presence
,
and
her
pace
was
becoming
so
much
quicker
that
the
sense
of
their
being
only
a
few
minutes
'
walk
from
the
yard
-
gates
of
the
Hall
Farm
at
last
gave
Seth
courage
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
quite
made
up
your
mind
to
go
back
to
Snowfield
o
'
Saturday
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Dinah
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
called
there
.
<EOS>
It
was
borne
in
upon
my
mind
while
I
was
meditating
on
Sunday
night
,
as
Sister
Allen
,
who
's
in
a
decline
,
is
in
need
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
as
plain
as
we
see
that
bit
of
thin
white
cloud
,
lifting
up
her
poor
thin
hand
and
beckoning
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
this
morning
when
I
opened
the
Bible
for
direction
,
the
first
words
my
eyes
fell
on
were
,
"
<EOS>
And
after
we
had
seen
the
vision
,
immediately
we
endeavoured
to
go
into
Macedonia
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
was
n't
for
that
clear
showing
of
the
Lord
's
will
,
I
should
be
loath
to
go
,
for
my
heart
yearns
over
my
aunt
and
her
little
ones
,
and
that
poor
wandering
lamb
Hetty
Sorrel
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
much
drawn
out
in
prayer
for
her
of
late
,
and
I
look
on
it
as
a
token
that
there
may
be
mercy
in
store
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
grant
it
,
"
said
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
I
doubt
Adam
's
heart
is
so
set
on
her
,
he
'll
never
turn
to
anybody
else
;
and
yet
it
'
ud
go
to
my
heart
if
he
was
to
marry
her
,
for
I
canna
think
as
she
'd
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
deep
mystery
 
<EOS>
the
way
the
heart
of
man
turns
to
one
woman
out
of
all
the
rest
he
's
seen
i
'
the
world
,
and
makes
it
easier
for
him
to
work
seven
year
for
HER
,
like
Jacob
did
for
Rachel
,
sooner
than
have
any
other
woman
for
th
'
asking
.
<EOS>
I
often
think
of
them
words
,
"
And
Jacob
served
seven
years
for
Rachel
;
and
they
seemed
to
him
but
a
few
days
for
the
love
he
had
to
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
those
words
'
ud
come
true
with
me
,
Dinah
,
if
so
be
you
'd
give
me
hope
as
I
might
win
you
after
seven
years
was
over
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
think
a
husband
'
ud
be
taking
up
too
much
o
'
your
thoughts
,
because
St.
Paul
says
,
"
She
that
's
married
careth
for
the
things
of
the
world
how
she
may
please
her
husband
"
;
and
may
happen
you
'll
think
me
overbold
to
speak
to
you
about
it
again
,
after
what
you
told
me
o
'
<EOS>
your
mind
last
Saturday
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
been
thinking
it
over
again
by
night
and
by
day
,
and
I
've
prayed
not
to
be
blinded
by
my
own
desires
,
to
think
what
's
only
good
for
me
must
be
good
for
you
too
.
<EOS>
And
it
seems
to
me
there
's
more
texts
for
your
marrying
than
ever
you
can
find
against
it
.
<EOS>
For
St.
Paul
says
as
plain
as
can
be
in
another
place
,
"
I
will
that
the
younger
women
marry
,
bear
children
,
guide
the
house
,
give
none
occasion
to
the
adversary
to
speak
reproachfully
"
;
and
then
"
two
are
better
than
one
"
;
and
that
holds
good
with
marriage
as
well
as
with
other
things
.
<EOS>
For
we
should
be
o
'
one
heart
and
o
'
one
mind
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
We
both
serve
the
same
Master
,
and
are
striving
after
the
same
gifts
;
and
I
'd
never
be
the
husband
to
make
a
claim
on
you
as
could
interfere
with
your
doing
the
work
God
has
fitted
you
for
.
<EOS>
I
'd
make
a
shift
,
and
fend
indoor
and
out
,
to
give
you
more
liberty
 
more
than
you
can
have
now
,
for
you
've
got
to
get
your
own
living
now
,
and
I
'm
strong
enough
to
work
for
us
both
.

When
Seth
had
once
begun
to
urge
his
suit
,
he
went
on
earnestly
and
almost
hurriedly
,
lest
Dinah
should
speak
some
decisive
word
before
he
had
poured
forth
all
the
arguments
he
had
prepared
.
<EOS>
His
cheeks
became
flushed
as
he
went
on
his
mild
grey
eyes
filled
with
tears
,
and
his
voice
trembled
as
he
spoke
the
last
sentence
.
<EOS>
They
had
reached
one
of
those
very
narrow
passes
between
two
tall
stones
,
which
performed
the
office
of
a
stile
in
Loamshire
,
and
Dinah
paused
as
she
turned
towards
Seth
and
said
,
in
her
tender
but
calm
treble
notes
,
"
Seth
Bede
,
I
thank
you
for
your
love
towards
me
,
and
if
I
could
think
of
any
man
as
more
than
a
Christian
brother
,
I
think
it
would
be
you
.
<EOS>
But
my
heart
is
not
free
to
marry
.
<EOS>
That
is
good
for
other
women
,
and
it
is
a
great
and
a
blessed
thing
to
be
a
wife
and
mother
;
but
"
as
God
has
distributed
to
every
man
,
as
the
Lord
hath
called
every
man
,
so
let
him
walk
.
<EOS>
"
God
has
called
me
to
minister
to
others
,
not
to
have
any
joys
or
sorrows
of
my
own
,
but
to
rejoice
with
them
that
do
rejoice
,
and
to
weep
with
those
that
weep
.
<EOS>
He
has
called
me
to
speak
his
word
,
and
he
has
greatly
owned
my
work
.
<EOS>
It
could
only
be
on
a
very
clear
showing
that
I
could
leave
the
brethren
and
sisters
at
Snowfield
,
who
are
favoured
with
very
little
of
this
world
's
good
;
where
the
trees
are
few
,
so
that
a
child
might
count
them
,
and
there
's
very
hard
living
for
the
poor
in
the
winter
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
given
me
to
help
,
to
comfort
,
and
strengthen
the
little
flock
there
and
to
call
in
many
wanderers
;
and
my
soul
is
filled
with
these
things
from
my
rising
up
till
my
lying
down
.
<EOS>
My
life
is
too
short
,
and
God
's
work
is
too
great
for
me
to
think
of
making
a
home
for
myself
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
've
not
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
your
words
,
Seth
,
<EOS>
for
when
I
saw
as
your
love
was
given
to
me
,
I
thought
it
might
be
a
leading
of
Providence
for
me
to
change
my
way
of
life
,
and
that
we
should
be
fellow
-
helpers
;
and
I
spread
the
matter
before
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
But
whenever
I
tried
to
fix
my
mind
on
marriage
,
and
our
living
together
,
other
thoughts
always
came
in
 
the
times
when
I
've
prayed
by
the
sick
and
dying
,
and
the
happy
hours
I
've
had
preaching
,
when
my
heart
was
filled
with
love
,
and
the
Word
was
given
to
me
abundantly
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
've
opened
the
Bible
for
direction
,
I
've
always
lighted
on
some
clear
word
to
tell
me
where
my
work
lay
.
<EOS>
I
believe
what
you
say
,
Seth
,
that
you
would
try
to
be
a
help
and
not
a
hindrance
to
my
work
;
but
I
see
that
our
marriage
is
not
God
's
will
 
<EOS>
He
draws
my
heart
another
way
.
<EOS>
I
desire
to
live
and
die
without
husband
or
children
.
<EOS>
I
seem
to
have
no
room
in
my
soul
for
wants
and
fears
of
my
own
,
it
has
pleased
God
to
fill
my
heart
so
full
with
the
wants
and
sufferings
of
his
poor
people
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
unable
to
reply
,
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
as
they
were
nearly
at
the
yard
-
gate
,
he
said
,
"
Well
,
Dinah
,
I
must
seek
for
strength
to
bear
it
,
and
to
endure
as
seeing
Him
who
is
invisible
.
<EOS>
But
I
feel
now
how
weak
my
faith
is
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
,
when
you
are
gone
,
I
could
never
joy
in
anything
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
's
something
passing
the
love
of
women
as
I
feel
for
you
,
for
I
could
be
content
without
your
marrying
me
if
I
could
go
and
live
at
Snowfield
and
be
near
you
.
<EOS>
I
trusted
as
the
strong
love
God
has
given
me
towards
you
<EOS>
was
a
leading
for
us
both
;
but
it
seems
it
was
only
meant
for
my
trial
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
feel
more
for
you
than
I
ought
to
feel
for
any
creature
,
for
I
often
ca
n't
help
saying
of
you
what
the
hymn
says
         
<EOS>
In
darkest
shades
if
she
appear
,
     
My
dawning
is
begun
;
     
She
is
my
soul
's
bright
morning
-
star
,
     
<EOS>
And
she
my
rising
sun
.
  
<EOS>
That
may
be
wrong
,
and
I
am
to
be
taught
better
.
<EOS>
But
you
would
n't
be
displeased
with
me
if
things
turned
out
so
as
I
could
leave
this
country
and
go
to
live
at
Snowfield
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Seth
;
but
I
counsel
you
to
wait
patiently
,
and
not
lightly
to
leave
your
own
country
and
kindred
.
<EOS>
Do
nothing
without
the
Lord
's
clear
bidding
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
bleak
and
barren
country
there
,
not
like
this
land
of
Goshen
you
've
been
used
to
.
<EOS>
We
must
n't
be
in
a
hurry
to
fix
and
choose
our
own
lot
;
we
must
wait
to
be
guided
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'd
let
me
write
you
a
letter
,
Dinah
,
if
there
was
anything
I
wanted
to
tell
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sure
;
let
me
know
if
you
're
in
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
continually
in
my
prayers
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
had
now
reached
the
yard
-
gate
,
and
Seth
said
,
"
I
wo
n't
go
in
,
Dinah
,
so
farewell
.
"
<EOS>
He
paused
and
hesitated
after
she
had
given
him
her
hand
,
and
then
said
,
"
There
's
no
knowing
but
what
you
may
see
things
different
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
a
new
leading
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
leave
that
,
Seth
.
<EOS>
It
's
good
to
live
only
a
moment
at
a
time
,
as
I
've
read
in
one
of
Mr.
Wesley
's
books
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
for
you
and
me
to
lay
plans
;
we
've
nothing
to
do
but
to
obey
and
to
trust
.
<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
pressed
his
hand
with
rather
a
sad
look
in
her
loving
eyes
,
and
then
passed
through
the
gate
,
while
Seth
turned
away
to
walk
lingeringly
home
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
taking
the
direct
road
,
he
chose
to
turn
back
along
the
fields
through
which
he
and
Dinah
had
already
passed
;
and
I
think
his
blue
linen
handkerchief
was
very
wet
with
tears
long
before
he
had
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
time
for
him
to
set
his
face
steadily
homewards
.
<EOS>
He
was
but
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
had
only
just
learned
what
it
is
to
love
 
to
love
with
that
adoration
which
a
young
man
gives
to
a
woman
whom
he
feels
to
be
greater
and
better
than
himself
.
<EOS>
Love
of
this
sort
is
hardly
distinguishable
from
religious
feeling
.
<EOS>
What
deep
and
worthy
love
is
so
,
whether
of
woman
or
child
,
or
art
or
music
.
<EOS>
Our
caresses
,
our
tender
words
,
our
still
rapture
under
the
influence
of
autumn
sunsets
,
or
pillared
vistas
,
or
calm
majestic
statues
,
or
Beethoven
symphonies
all
bring
with
them
the
consciousness
that
they
are
mere
waves
and
ripples
in
an
unfathomable
ocean
of
love
and
beauty
;
our
emotion
in
its
keenest
moment
passes
from
expression
into
silence
,
our
love
at
its
highest
flood
rushes
beyond
its
object
and
loses
itself
in
the
sense
of
divine
mystery
.
<EOS>
And
this
blessed
gift
of
venerating
love
has
been
given
to
too
many
humble
craftsmen
since
the
world
began
for
us
to
feel
any
surprise
that
it
should
have
existed
in
the
soul
of
a
Methodist
carpenter
half
a
century
ago
,
while
there
was
yet
a
lingering
after
-
glow
from
the
time
when
Wesley
and
his
fellow
-
labourer
fed
on
the
hips
and
haws
of
the
Cornwall
hedges
,
after
exhausting
limbs
and
lungs
in
carrying
a
divine
message
to
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
That
afterglow
has
long
faded
away
;
and
the
picture
we
are
apt
to
make
of
Methodism
in
our
imagination
is
not
an
amphitheatre
of
green
hills
,
or
the
deep
shade
of
broad
-
leaved
sycamores
,
where
a
crowd
of
rough
men
and
weary
-
hearted
women
drank
in
a
faith
which
was
a
rudimentary
culture
,
which
linked
their
thoughts
with
the
past
,
lifted
their
imagination
above
the
sordid
details
of
their
own
narrow
lives
,
and
suffused
their
souls
with
the
sense
of
a
pitying
,
loving
,
infinite
Presence
,
sweet
as
summer
to
the
houseless
needy
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
possible
that
to
some
of
my
readers
Methodism
may
mean
nothing
more
than
low
-
pitched
gables
up
dingy
streets
,
sleek
grocers
,
sponging
preachers
,
and
hypocritical
jargon
 
elements
which
are
regarded
as
an
exhaustive
analysis
of
Methodism
in
many
fashionable
quarters
.
  
<EOS>
That
would
be
a
pity
;
for
I
can
not
pretend
that
Seth
and
Dinah
were
anything
else
than
Methodists
 
not
indeed
of
that
modern
type
which
reads
quarterly
reviews
and
attends
in
chapels
with
pillared
porticoes
,
but
of
a
very
old
-
fashioned
kind
.
<EOS>
They
believed
in
present
miracles
,
in
instantaneous
conversions
,
in
revelations
by
dreams
and
visions
;
they
drew
lots
,
and
sought
for
Divine
guidance
by
opening
the
Bible
at
hazard
;
having
a
literal
way
of
interpreting
the
Scriptures
,
which
is
not
at
all
sanctioned
by
approved
commentators
;
and
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
represent
their
diction
as
correct
,
or
their
instruction
as
liberal
.
<EOS>
Still
 
if
I
have
read
religious
history
aright
 
faith
,
hope
,
and
charity
have
not
always
been
found
in
a
direct
ratio
with
a
sensibility
to
the
three
concords
,
and
it
is
possible
 
thank
Heaven
!
 
<EOS>
to
have
very
erroneous
theories
and
very
sublime
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
raw
bacon
which
clumsy
Molly
spares
from
her
own
scanty
store
that
she
may
carry
it
to
her
neighbour
's
child
to
"
stop
the
fits
,
"
may
be
a
piteously
inefficacious
remedy
;
but
the
generous
stirring
of
neighbourly
kindness
that
prompted
the
deed
has
a
beneficent
radiation
that
is
not
lost
.
  
<EOS>
Considering
these
things
,
we
can
hardly
think
Dinah
and
Seth
beneath
our
sympathy
,
accustomed
as
we
may
be
to
weep
over
the
loftier
sorrows
of
heroines
in
satin
boots
and
crinoline
,
and
of
heroes
riding
fiery
horses
,
themselves
ridden
by
still
more
fiery
passions
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
Seth
!
<EOS>
He
was
never
on
horseback
in
his
life
except
once
,
when
he
was
a
little
lad
,
and
Mr.
Jonathan
Burge
took
him
up
behind
,
telling
him
to
"
hold
on
tight
"
;
and
instead
of
bursting
out
into
wild
accusing
apostrophes
to
God
and
destiny
,
he
is
resolving
,
as
he
now
walks
homewards
under
the
solemn
starlight
,
to
repress
his
sadness
,
to
be
less
bent
on
having
his
own
will
,
and
to
live
more
for
others
,
as
Dinah
does
.
    
<EOS>
Home
and
Its
Sorrows
  
<EOS>
A
GREEN
valley
with
a
brook
running
through
it
,
full
almost
to
overflowing
with
the
late
rains
,
<EOS>
overhung
by
low
stooping
willows
.
<EOS>
Across
this
brook
a
plank
is
thrown
,
and
over
this
plank
Adam
Bede
is
passing
with
his
undoubting
step
,
followed
close
by
Gyp
with
the
basket
;
evidently
making
his
way
to
the
thatched
house
,
with
a
stack
of
timber
by
the
side
of
it
,
about
twenty
yards
up
the
opposite
slope
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
of
the
house
is
open
,
and
an
elderly
woman
is
looking
out
;
but
she
is
not
placidly
contemplating
the
evening
sunshine
;
she
has
been
watching
with
dim
eyes
the
gradually
enlarging
speck
which
for
the
last
few
minutes
she
has
been
quite
sure
<EOS>
is
her
darling
son
Adam
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
Bede
loves
her
son
with
the
love
of
a
woman
to
whom
her
first
-
born
has
come
late
in
life
.
<EOS>
She
is
an
anxious
,
spare
,
yet
vigorous
old
woman
,
clean
as
a
snowdrop
.
<EOS>
Her
grey
hair
is
turned
neatly
back
under
a
pure
linen
cap
with
a
black
band
<EOS>
round
it
<EOS>
;
her
broad
chest
is
covered
with
a
buff
neckerchief
,
and
below
this
you
see
a
sort
of
short
bedgown
made
of
blue
-
checkered
linen
,
tied
round
the
waist
and
descending
to
the
hips
,
<EOS>
from
whence
there
is
a
considerable
length
of
linsey
-
woolsey
petticoat
.
<EOS>
For
Lisbeth
is
tall
,
and
in
other
points
too
there
is
a
strong
likeness
between
her
and
her
son
Adam
.
<EOS>
Her
dark
eyes
are
somewhat
dim
now
 
perhaps
from
too
much
crying
 
but
her
broadly
marked
eyebrows
are
still
black
,
her
teeth
are
sound
,
and
as
she
stands
knitting
rapidly
and
unconsciously
with
her
work
-
hardened
hands
,
she
has
as
firmly
upright
an
attitude
as
when
she
is
carrying
a
pail
of
water
on
her
head
from
the
spring
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
same
type
of
frame
and
the
same
keen
activity
of
temperament
in
mother
and
son
,
but
it
was
not
from
her
that
Adam
got
his
well
-
filled
brow
and
his
expression
of
large
-
hearted
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
Family
likeness
has
often
a
deep
sadness
in
it
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
that
great
tragic
dramatist
,
knits
us
together
by
bone
and
muscle
,
and
divides
us
by
the
subtler
web
of
our
brains
;
blends
yearning
and
repulsion
;
and
ties
us
by
our
heart
-
strings
to
the
beings
that
jar
us
at
every
movement
.
<EOS>
We
hear
a
voice
with
the
very
cadence
of
our
own
uttering
the
thoughts
we
despise
;
we
see
eyes
 
ah
,
so
like
our
mother
's
!
 
<EOS>
averted
from
us
in
cold
alienation
;
and
our
last
darling
child
startles
us
with
the
air
and
gestures
of
the
sister
we
parted
from
in
bitterness
long
years
ago
.
<EOS>
The
father
to
whom
we
owe
our
best
heritage
 
the
mechanical
instinct
,
the
keen
sensibility
to
harmony
,
the
unconscious
skill
of
the
modelling
hand
 
galls
us
and
puts
us
to
shame
by
his
daily
errors
;
the
long
-
lost
mother
,
whose
face
we
begin
to
see
in
the
glass
as
our
own
wrinkles
come
,
once
fretted
our
young
souls
with
her
anxious
humours
and
irrational
persistence
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
such
a
fond
anxious
mother
's
voice
that
you
hear
,
as
Lisbeth
says
,
"
Well
,
my
lad
,
it
's
gone
seven
by
th
'
clock
.
<EOS>
Thee't
<EOS>
allays
stay
till
the
last
child
's
born

<EOS>
Thee
wants
thy

I
'll

<EOS>
Where
's
Seth
?
<EOS>
Gone
arter
some
o

,
I
reckon
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
Seth
's
at
no
harm
,
mother
,
thee
mayst
be
sure
.
<EOS>
But
where
's
father
?
"
said
Adam
quickly
,
as
he
entered
the
house
and
glanced
into
the
room
on
the
left
hand
,
which
was
used
as
a
workshop
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
n't
he
done
the
coffin
for
Tholer
?
<EOS>
There
's
the
stuff
standing
just
as
I
left
it
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Done
the
coffin
?
"
said
Lisbeth
,
following
him
,
and
knitting
uninterruptedly
,
though
she
looked
at
her
son
very
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
,
my
lad
,
he
went
aff
to
Treddles'on
<EOS>
this
forenoon
,
an
's
niver
come
back
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
he
's
got
to
th
'
"
Waggin
Overthrow
"
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
A
deep
flush
of
anger
passed
rapidly
over
Adam
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
but
threw
off
his
jacket
and
began
to
roll
up
his
shirt
-
sleeves
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
art
goin'
to
do
,
Adam
?
"
said
the
mother
,
with
a
tone
and
look
of
alarm
.
"
<EOS>
Thee
wouldstna
go
to
work
again
,
wi'out
<EOS>
ha'in
<EOS>
thy
bit
o
'
supper
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
too
angry
to
speak
,
walked
into
the
workshop
.
<EOS>
But
his
mother
threw
down
her
knitting
,
and
,
hurrying
after
him
,
took
hold
of
his
arm
,
and
said
,
in
a
tone
of
plaintive
remonstrance
,
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
my
lad
,
my
lad
,
thee
munna
go
wi'out
<EOS>
thy
supper
;
there
's
the
taters
wi
'
the
gravy
in
'em
,
just
as
thee
lik'st
'em
.
<EOS>
I
saved
'em
o
'
purpose
for
thee
.
<EOS>
Come
an
'
ha
'
thy
supper
,
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
be
!
"
said
Adam
impetuously
,
shaking
her
off
and
seizing
one
of
the
planks
that
stood
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
fine
talking
about
having
supper
when
here
's
a
coffin
promised
to
be
ready
at
Brox'on
by
seven
o'clock
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
ought
to
ha
'
been
there
now
,
and
not
a
nail
struck
yet
.
<EOS>
My
throat
's
too
full
to
swallow
victuals
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thee
canstna
get
the
coffin
ready
,
"
said
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee't
work
thyself
to
death
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
take
thee
all
night
to
do't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
signifies
how
long
it
takes
me
?
<EOS>
Is
n't
the
coffin
promised
?
<EOS>
Can
they
bury
the
man
without
a
coffin
?
<EOS>
I
'd
work
my
right
hand
off
sooner
than
deceive
people
with
lies
<EOS>
i
'
that
way
.
<EOS>
It
makes
me
mad
to
think
on't
.
<EOS>
I
shall
overrun
these
doings
before
long
.
<EOS>
I
've
stood
enough
of
'
em

"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lisbeth
did
not
hear
this
threat
for
the
first
time
,
and
if
she
had
been
wise
<EOS>
she
would
have
gone
away
quietly
and
said
nothing
for
the
next
hour
.
<EOS>
But
one
of
the
lessons
a
woman
most
rarely
learns
is
never
to
talk
to
an
angry
or
a
drunken
man
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
sat
down
on
the
chopping
bench
and
began
to
cry
,
and
by
the
time
she
had
cried
enough
to
make
her
voice
very
piteous
,
she
burst
out
into
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
's
voice
became
louder
,
and
choked
with
sobs
 
a
sort
of
wail
,
the
most
irritating
of
all
sounds
where
real
sorrows
are
to
be
borne
and
real
work
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
Adam
broke
in
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mother
,
do
n't
cry
and
talk
so
.
<EOS>
Have
n't
I
got
enough
to
vex
me
without
that
?
<EOS>
What
's
th
'
use
o
'
telling
me
things
as
I
only
think
too
much
on
every
day
?
<EOS>
If
I
didna
think
on
'em
,
why
should
I
do
as
I
do
,
for
the
sake
<EOS>
o
'
keeping
things
together
here
?
<EOS>
But
I
hate
to
be
talking
where
it
's
no
use
:
I
like
to
keep
my
breath
for
doing
i'stead
o
'
talking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
thee

<EOS>
But

<EOS>
Thee

thy

more

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
better
than
speaking
soft
and
letting
things
go
the
wrong
way
,
I
reckon
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
If
I
was
n't
sharp
with
him
he
'd
sell
every
bit
o

stuff
<EOS>
i

th

yard
and
spend
it
on
drink
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
's
a
duty
to
be
done
by
my
father
,
but
it
is
n't
my
duty
to
encourage
him
in
running
headlong
to
ruin
.
<EOS>
And
what
has
Seth
got
to
do
with
it
?
<EOS>
The
lad
does
no
harm
as
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
But
leave
me
alone
,
Mother
,
and
let
me
get
on
with
the
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
dared
not
say
any
more
;
but
she
got
up
and
called
Gyp
,
thinking
to
console
herself
somewhat
for
Adam
's
refusal
of
the
supper
she
had
spread
out
in
the
loving
expectation
of
looking
at
him
while
he
ate
it
,
by
feeding
Adam
's
dog
with
extra
liberality
.
<EOS>
But
Gyp
was
watching
his
master
with
wrinkled
brow
and
ears
erect
,
puzzled
at
this
unusual
course
of
things
;
and
though
he
glanced
at
Lisbeth
when
she
called
him
,
and
moved
his
fore
-
paws
uneasily
,
<EOS>
well
knowing
that
she
was
inviting
him
to
supper
,
he
was
in
a
divided
state
of
mind
,
and
remained
seated
on
his
haunches
,
again
fixing
his
eyes
anxiously
on
his
master
.
<EOS>
Adam
noticed
Gyp
's
mental
conflict
,
and
though
his
anger
had
made
him
less
tender
than
usual
to
his
mother
,
it
did
not
prevent
him
from
caring
as
much
as
usual
for
his
dog
.
<EOS>
We
are
apt
to
be
kinder
to
the
brutes
that
love
us
than
to
the
women
that
love
us
.
<EOS>
Is
it
because
the
brutes
are
dumb
?
  
<EOS>
"
Go
,
Gyp
;
go
,
lad
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
said
,
in
a
tone
of
encouraging
command
;
and
Gyp
,
apparently
satisfied
that
duty
and
pleasure
were
one
,
followed
Lisbeth
into
the
house
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
had
he
licked
up
his
supper
than
he
went
back
to
his
master
,
while
Lisbeth
sat
down
alone
to
cry
over
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
Women
who
are
never
bitter
and
resentful
are
often
the
most
querulous
;
and
if
Solomon
was
as
wise
as
he
is
reputed
to
be
,
I
feel
sure
that
when
he
compared
a
contentious
woman
to
a
continual
dropping
on
a
very
rainy
day
,
he
had
not
a
vixen
in
his
eye
 
a
fury
with
long
nails
,
acrid
and
selfish
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
it
,
he
meant
a
good
creature
,
who
had
no
joy
but
in
the
happiness
of
the
loved
ones
whom
she
contributed
to
make
uncomfortable
,
putting
by
all
the
tid
-
bits
for
them
and
spending
nothing
on
herself
.
<EOS>
Such
a
woman
as
Lisbeth
,
for
example
 
at
once
patient
and
complaining
,
self
-
renouncing
and
exacting
,
brooding
the
livelong
day
over
what
happened
yesterday
and
what
is
likely
to
happen
to
-
morrow
,
and
crying
very
readily
both
at
the
good
and
the
evil
.
<EOS>
But
a
certain
awe
mingled
itself
with
her
idolatrous
love
of
Adam
,
and
when
he
said
,
"
Leave
me
alone
,
"
she
was
always
silenced
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
hours
passed
,
to
the
loud
ticking
of
the
old
day
-
clock
and
the
sound
of
Adam
's
tools
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
called
for
a
light
and
a
draught
of
water
<EOS>
(
beer
was
a
thing
only
to
be
drunk
on
holidays
)
,
and
Lisbeth
ventured
to
say
as
she
took
it
in
,
"
Thy
supper
stan
's
ready
for
thee
,
when
thee
lik'st
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Donna
thee
sit
up
,
mother
,
"
said
Adam
,
in
a
gentle
tone
.
<EOS>
He
had
worked
off
his
anger
now
,
and
whenever
he
wished
to
be
especially
kind
to
his
mother
,
he
fell
into
his
strongest
native
accent
and
dialect
,
<EOS>
with
which
at
other
times
his
speech
was
less
deeply
tinged
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
see
to
Father
when
he
comes
home
;
maybe
he
wonna
come
at
all
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
easier
if
thee't
<EOS>
i

bed

<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
I
'll
bide
till
Seth
comes
.
<EOS>
He
wonna
be
long
now
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
then
past
nine
by
the
clock
,
which
was
always
in
advance
of
the
days
,
and
before
it
had
struck
ten
the
latch
was
lifted
and
Seth
entered
.
<EOS>
He
had
heard
the
sound
of
the
tools
as
he
was
approaching
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
"
how
is
it
as
Father
's
working
so
late
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
none
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
thy
feyther
as

workin

"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
was
going
on
,
for
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
Seth
,
and
usually
poured
into
his
ears
all
the
querulousness
which
was
repressed
by
her
awe
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
Seth
had
never
in
his
life
spoken
a
harsh
word
to
his
mother
,
and
timid
people
always
wreak
their
peevishness
on
the
gentle
.
<EOS>
But
Seth
,
with
an
anxious
look
,
had
passed
into
the
workshop
and
said
,
"
Addy
,
how
's
this
?
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Father
's
forgot
the
coffin
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
lad
,
th
'
old
tale
;
but
I
shall
get
it
done
,
"
said
Adam
,
looking
up
and
casting
one
of
his
bright
keen
glances
at
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
thee
?
<EOS>
Thee't
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
's
eyes
were
red
,
and
there
was
a
look
of
deep
depression
on
his
mild
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Addy
,
but
it
's
what
must
be
borne
,
and
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
Why
,
thee'st
never
been
to
the
school
,
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
School
?
<EOS>
No
,
that
screw
can
wait
,
"
said
Adam
,
hammering
away
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
take
my
turn
now
,
and
do
thee
go
to
bed
,
"
said
Seth
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
lad
,
I
'd
rather
go
on
,
now
I
'm
in
harness
.
<EOS>
Thee't
<EOS>
help
me
to
carry
it
to
Brox'on
when
it
's
done

<EOS>
I
'll
call
thee
up
at

<EOS>
Go
and
eat
thy
supper
,
and
shut
the
door
so
as
I
may
n't
hear
Mother
's
talk

"
  
<EOS>
Seth
knew
that
Adam
always
meant
what
he
said
,
and
was
not
to
be
persuaded
into
meaning
anything
else
.
<EOS>
So
he
turned
,
with
rather
a
heavy
heart
,
into
the
house
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
's
niver

said
Lisbeth

Thee'st

it

a

about

not

<EOS>
I
'll
just
look
in
at
Adam
again
,
and
see
if
he
'll
let
me
go
on
with
the
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
'
a
drop
o
'
warm
broth
?
"
said
Lisbeth
,
whose
motherly
feeling
now
got
the
better
of
her
"
nattering
"
habit
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
set
two
-
three
sticks
a

light
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Mother
,
thank
thee
;
thee't
very
good
,
"
said
Seth
,
gratefully
;
and
encouraged
by
this
touch
of
tenderness
,
he
went
on
:
"
Let
me
pray
a
bit
with
thee
for
Father
,
and
Adam
,
and
all
of
us
 
<EOS>
it
'll
comfort
thee
,
happen
,
more
than
thee
thinkst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
've
nothin'
to
say
again
'
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
,
though
disposed
always
to
take
the
negative
side
in
her
conversations
with
Seth
,
had
a
vague
sense
that
there
was
some
comfort
and
safety
in
the
fact
of
his
piety
,
and
that
it
somehow
relieved
her
from
the
trouble
of
any
spiritual
transactions
on
her
own
behalf
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
mother
and
son
knelt
down
together
,
and
Seth
prayed
for
the
poor
wandering
father
and
for
those
who
were
sorrowing
for
him
at
home
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
came
to
the
petition
that
Adam
might
never
be
called
to
set
up
his
tent
in
a
far
country
,
but
that
his
mother
might
be
cheered
and
comforted
by
his
presence
all
the
days
of
her
pilgrimage
,
Lisbeth
's
ready
tears
flowed
again
,
and
she
wept
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
rose
from
their
knees
,
Seth
went
to
Adam
again
and
said
,
"
Wilt
only
lie
down
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
let
me
go
on
the
while
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
Seth
,
no
.
<EOS>
Make
Mother
go
to
bed
,
and
go
thyself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Meantime
Lisbeth
had
dried
her
eyes
,
and
now
followed
Seth
,
holding
something
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
brown
-
and
-
yellow
platter
containing
the
baked
potatoes
with
the
gravy
in
them
and
bits
of
meat
which
she
had
cut
and
mixed
among
them
.
<EOS>
Those
were
dear
times
,
when
wheaten
bread
and
fresh
meat
were
delicacies
to
working
people
.
<EOS>
She
set
the
dish
down
rather
timidly
on
the
bench
by
Adam
's
side
and
said
,
"
Thee
canst
pick
a
bit
while
thee't
workin
'
.
<EOS>
I
'll
bring
thee
<EOS>
another
drop
o
'
water
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
Mother
,
do
,
"
said
Adam
,
kindly
;
"
I
'm
getting
very
thirsty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
all
was
quiet
;
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
in
the
house
but
the
loud
ticking
of
the
old
day
-
clock
and
the
ringing
of
Adam
's
tools
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
very
still
:
when
Adam
opened
the
door
to
look
out
at
twelve
o'clock
,
the
only
motion
seemed
to
be
in
the
glowing
,
twinkling
stars
;
every
blade
of
grass
was
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
Bodily
haste
and
exertion
usually
leave
our
thoughts
very
much
at
the
mercy
of
our
feelings
and
imagination
;
and
it
was
so
to
-
night
with
Adam
.
<EOS>
While
his
muscles
were
working
lustily
,
his
mind
seemed
as
passive
as
a
spectator
at
a
diorama
:
scenes
of
the
sad
past
,
and
probably
sad
future
,
floating
before
him
and
giving
place
one
to
the
other
in
swift
succession
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
how
it
would
be
to
-
morrow
morning
,
when
he
had
carried
the
coffin
to
Broxton
and
was
at
home
again
,
having
his
breakfast
:
his
father
perhaps
would
come
in
ashamed
to
meet
his
son
's
glance
 
would
sit
down
,
looking
older
and
more
tottering
than
he
had
done
the
morning
before
,
and
hang
down
his
head
,
examining
the
floor
-
quarries
;
while
Lisbeth
would
ask
him
how
he
supposed
the
coffin
had
been
got
ready
,
that
he
had
slinked
off
and
left
undone
 
for
Lisbeth
was
always
the
first
to
utter
the
word
of
reproach
,
although
she
cried
at
Adam
's
severity
towards
his
father
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
it
will
go
on
,
worsening
and
worsening
,
"
thought
Adam
;
"
there
's
no
slipping
uphill
again
,
and
no
standing
still
when
once
you
'
ve
begun
to
slip
down
.
"
<EOS>
And
then
the
day
came
back
to
him
when
he
was
a
little
fellow
and
used
to
run
by
his
father
's
side
,
proud
to
be
taken
out
to
work
,
and
prouder
still
to
hear
his
father
boasting
to
his
fellow
-
workmen
how
"
the
little
chap
had
an
uncommon
notion
o
'
carpentering
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
fine
active
fellow
his
father
was
then
!
<EOS>
When
people
asked
Adam
whose
little
lad
he
was
,
he
had
a
sense
of
distinction
as
he
answered
,
"
I
'm
Thias
Bede
's
lad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
quite
sure
everybody
knew
<EOS>
Thias
Bede
 
<EOS>
did
n't
he
make
the
wonderful
pigeon
-
house
at
Broxton
parsonage
?
<EOS>
Those
were
happy
days
,
especially
when
Seth
,
who
was
three
years
the
younger
,
began
to
go
out
working
too
,
and
Adam
began
to
be
a
teacher
as
well
as
a
learner
.
<EOS>
But
then
came
the
days
of
sadness
,
when
Adam
was
someway
on
in
his
teens
,
and
Thias
began
to
loiter
at
the
public
-
houses
,
and
Lisbeth
began
to
cry
at
home
,
and
to
pour
forth
her
plaints
in
the
hearing
of
her
sons
.
<EOS>
Adam
remembered
well
the
night
of
shame
and
anguish
when
he
first
saw
his
father
quite
wild
and
foolish
,
shouting
a
song
out
fitfully
among
his
drunken
companions
at
the
"
Waggon
Overthrown
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
run
away
once
when
he
was
only
eighteen
,
making
his
escape
in
the
morning
twilight
with
a
little
blue
bundle
over
his
shoulder
,
and
his
"
mensuration
book
"
in
his
pocket
,
and
saying
to
himself
very
decidedly
that
he
could
bear
the
vexations
of
home
no
longer
 
he
would
go
and
seek
his
fortune
,
setting
up
his
stick
at
the
crossways
and
bending
his
steps
the
way
it
fell
.
<EOS>
But
by
the
time
he
got
to
Stoniton
,
the
thought
of
his
mother
and
Seth
,
left

everything
without
him

became
too
importunate
,
and
his
resolution
failed
him

<EOS>
He
came
back
the
next
day
,
but
the
misery
and
terror
his
mother
had
gone
through
in
those
two
days
had
haunted
her
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

"
<EOS>
Adam
said
to
himself
to
-
night
,
"
that
must
never
happen
again
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
make
a
poor
balance
when
my
doings
are
cast
up
at
the
last

if
my
poor
old
mother
stood
o

the
wrong
side

<EOS>
My
back
's
broad
enough
and
strong
enough
;
I
should
be
no
better
than
a
coward
to
go
away
and
leave
the
troubles
to
be
borne
by
them
as
are
n't
half
so
able
.
<EOS>
"
They
that
are
strong
ought
to
bear
the
infirmities
of
those
that
are
weak
,
and
not
to
please
themselves
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
text
wants
no
candle
to
show't
;
it
shines
by
its
own
light
.
<EOS>
It
's
plain
enough
you
get
into
the
wrong
road
<EOS>
i

<EOS>
this
life
if
you
run
after
this
and
that
only
for
the
sake
o

making
things
easy
and
pleasant
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
A
pig
may
poke
his
nose
into
the
trough
and
think
o
'
nothing
outside
it
;
but
if
you
've
got
a
man
's
heart
and
soul
in
you

you
ca

<EOS>
Nay

nay

I
'll

out

Father

a

What

<EOS>
I

and
the

"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
a
smart
rap
,
as
if
with
a
willow
wand
,
was
given
at
the
house
door
,
and
Gyp
,
instead
of
barking
,
as
might
have
been
expected
,
gave
a
loud
howl
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
very
much
startled
,
went
at
once
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
there
;
all
was
still
,
as
when
he
opened
it
an
hour
before
;
the
leaves
were
motionless
,
and
the
light
of
the
stars
showed
the
placid
fields
on
both
sides
of
the
brook
quite
empty
of
visible
life
.
<EOS>
Adam
walked
round
the
house
,
and
still
saw
nothing
except
a
rat
which
darted
into
the
woodshed
as
he
passed
.
<EOS>
He
went
in
again
,
wondering
;
the
sound
was
so
peculiar
that
the
moment
he
heard
it
it
called
up
the
image
of
the
willow
wand
striking
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
help
a
little
shudder
,
as
he
remembered
how
often
his
mother
had
told
him
of
just
such
a
sound
coming
as
a
sign
when
some
one
was
dying
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
not
a
man
to
be
gratuitously
superstitious
,
but
he
had
the
blood
of
the
peasant
in
him
as
well
as
of
the
artisan
,
and
a
peasant
can
no
more
help
believing
in
a
traditional
superstition
than
a
horse
can
help
trembling
when
he
sees
a
camel
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
had
that
mental
combination
which
is
at
once
humble
in
the
region
of
mystery
and
keen
in
the
region
of
knowledge
:
it
was
the
depth
of
his
reverence
quite
as
much
as
his
hard
common
sense
which
gave
him
his
disinclination
to
doctrinal
religion
,
and
he
often
checked
Seth
's
argumentative
spiritualism
by
saying
,
"
Eh
,
it
's
a
big
mystery
;
thee
know'st
but
little
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
it
happened
that
Adam
was
at
once
penetrating
and
credulous
.
<EOS>
If
a
new
building
had
fallen
down
and
he
had
been
told
that
this
was
a
divine
judgment
,
he
would
have
said
,
"
May
be
;
but
the
bearing
o
'
the
roof
and
walls
was
n't
right
,
else
it
would
n't
ha
'
come
down
"
;
yet
he
believed
in
dreams
and
prognostics
,
and
to
his
dying
day
he
bated
his
breath
a
little
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
stroke
with
the
willow
wand
.
<EOS>
I
tell
it
as
he
told
it
,
not
attempting
to
reduce
it
to
its
natural
elements
 
in
our
eagerness
to
explain
impressions
,
we
often
lose
our
hold
of
the
sympathy
that
comprehends
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
had
the
best
antidote
against
imaginative
dread
in
the
necessity
for
getting
on
with
the
coffin
,
and
for
the
next
ten
minutes
his
hammer
was
ringing
so
uninterruptedly
,
that
other
sounds
,
if
there
were
any
,
might
well
be
overpowered
.
<EOS>
A
pause
came
,
however
,
when
he
had
to
take
up
his
ruler
,
and
now
again
came
the
strange
rap
,
and
again
Gyp
howled
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
at
the
door
without
the
loss
of
a
moment
;
but
again
all
was
still
,
and
the
starlight
showed
there
was
nothing
but
the
dew
-
laden
grass
in
front
of
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
for
a
moment
thought
uncomfortably
about
his
father
;
but
of
late
years
he
had
never
come
home
at
dark
hours
from
Treddleston
,
and
there
was
every
reason
for
believing
that
he
was
then
sleeping
off
his
drunkenness
at
the
"
Waggon
Overthrown
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
to
Adam
,
the
conception
of
the
future
was
so
inseparable
from
the
painful
image
of
his
father
that
the
fear
of
any
fatal
accident
to
him
was
excluded
by
the
deeply
infixed
fear
of
his
continual
degradation
.
<EOS>
The
next
thought
that
occurred
to
him
was
one
that
made
him
slip
off
his
shoes
and
tread
lightly
upstairs
,
to
listen
at
the
bedroom
doors
.
<EOS>
But
both
Seth
and
his
mother
were
breathing
regularly
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
came
down
and
set
to
work
again
,
saying
to
himself
,
"
I
wo
n't
open
the
door
again
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
staring
about
to
catch
sight
of
a
sound
.
<EOS>
Maybe
there
's
a
world
about
us
as
we
ca
n't
see
,
but
th
'
ear
's
quicker
than
the
eye
and
catches
a
sound
from't
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
Some
people
think
they
get
a
sight
on't
too
,
but
they
're
mostly
folks
whose
eyes
are
not
much
use
to
'em
at
anything
else
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
think
it
's
better
to
see
when
your
perpendicular
's
true
than
to
see
a
ghost
.
"
  
<EOS>
Such
thoughts
as
these
are
apt
to
grow
stronger
and
stronger
as
daylight
quenches
the
candles
and
the
birds
begin
to
sing
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
the
red
sunlight
shone
on
the
brass
nails
that
formed
the
initials
on
the
lid
of
the
coffin
,
any
lingering
foreboding
from
the
sound
of
the
willow
wand
was
merged
in
satisfaction
that
the
work
was
done
and
the
promise
redeemed
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
to
call
Seth
,
for
he
was
already
moving
overhead
,
and
presently
came
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
lad
,
"
said
Adam
,
as
Seth
made
his
appearance
,
"
the
coffin
's
done
,
and
we
can
take
it
over
to
Brox'on
,
and
be
back
again
before
half
after
six
<EOS>
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
a
mouthful
o
'
oat
-
cake
,
and
then
we
'll
be
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
coffin
was
soon
propped
on
the
tall
shoulders
of
the
two
brothers
,
and
they
were
making
their
way
,
followed
close
by
Gyp
,
out
of
the
little
woodyard
into
the
lane
at
the
back
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
Broxton
over
the
opposite
slope
,
and
their
road
wound
very
pleasantly
along
lanes
and
across
fields
,
where
the
pale
woodbines
and
the
dog
-
roses
were
scenting
the
hedgerows
,
and
the
birds
were
twittering
and
trilling
in
the
tall
leafy
boughs
of
oak
and
elm
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
strangely
mingled
picture
 
the
fresh
youth
of
the
summer
morning
,
with
its
Edenlike
peace
and
loveliness
,
the
stalwart
strength
of
the
two
brothers
in
their
rusty
working
clothes
,
and
the
long
coffin
on
their
shoulders
.
<EOS>
They
paused
for
the
last
time
before
a
small
farmhouse
outside
the
village
of
Broxton
.
<EOS>
By
six
o'clock
the
task
was
done
,
the
coffin
nailed
down
,
and
Adam
and
Seth
were
on
their
way
home
.
<EOS>
They
chose
a
shorter
way
homewards
,
which
would
take
them
across
the
fields
and
the
brook
in
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
not
mentioned
to
Seth
what
had
happened
in
the
night
,
but
he
still
retained
sufficient
impression
from
it
himself
to
say
,
"
Seth
,
lad
,
if
Father
is
n't
come
home
by
the
time
we
've
had
our
breakfast
,
I
think
it
'll
be
as
well
for
thee
to
go
over
to
Treddles'on
and
look
after
him
,
and
thee
canst
get
me
the
brass
wire
I
want
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
about
losing
an
hour
at
thy
work
;
we
can
make
that
up
.
<EOS>
What
dost
say
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
willing
,
"
said
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
see
what
clouds
have
gathered
since
we
set
out
.
<EOS>
I
'm
thinking
we
shall
have
more
rain
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
sore
time
for
th
'
haymaking
if
the
meadows
are
flooded
again
.
<EOS>
The
brook
's
fine
and
full
now
:
another
day
's
rain
'
ud
cover
the
plank
,
and
we
should
have
to
go
round
by
the
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
coming
across
the
valley
now
,
and
had
entered
the
pasture
through
which
the
brook
ran
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
that
sticking
against
the
willow
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Seth
,
beginning
to
walk
faster
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
rose
to
his
mouth
:
the
vague
anxiety
about
his
father
was
changed
into
a
great
dread
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
to
Seth
,
but
ran
forward
preceded
by
Gyp
,
who
began
to
bark
uneasily
;
and
in
two
moments
he
was
at
the
bridge
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
what
the
omen
meant
,
then
!
<EOS>
And
the
grey
-
haired
father
,
of
whom
he
had
thought
with
a
sort
of
hardness
a
few
hours
ago
,
as
certain
to
live
to
be
a
thorn
in
his
side
was
perhaps
even
then
struggling
with
that
watery
death
!
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
thought
that
flashed
through
Adam
's
conscience
,
before
he
had
time
to
seize
the
coat
and
drag
out
the
tall
heavy
body
.
<EOS>
Seth
was
already
by
his
side
,
helping
him
,
and
when
they
had
it
on
the
bank
,
the
two
sons
in
the
first
moment
knelt
and
looked
with
mute
awe
at
the
glazed
eyes
,
forgetting
that
there
was
need
for
action
 
forgetting
everything
but
that
their
father
lay
dead
before
them
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
run
to
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
loud
whisper
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
back
to
thee
in
a
minute
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Lisbeth
was
busy
preparing
her
sons
'
breakfast
,
and
their
porridge
was
already
steaming
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Her
kitchen
always
looked
the
pink
of
cleanliness
,
but
this
morning
she
was
more
than
usually
bent
on
making
her
hearth
and
breakfast
-
table
look
comfortable
and
inviting
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
lads
'
ull
be
fine
an
'
hungry
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
half
-
aloud
,
as
she
stirred
the
porridge
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
good
step
to
Brox'on
,
an
'
it
's
hungry

<EOS>
Eh

again
afore
the

out

<EOS>
Eh

poor
mon

he
takes
it
quiet
enough
;
there
's
no
denyin

that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
now
Lisbeth
heard
the
heavy
"
thud
"
of
a
running
footstep
on
the
turf
,
and
,
turning
quickly
towards
the
door
,
she
saw
Adam
enter
,
looking
so
pale
and
overwhelmed
that
she
screamed
aloud
and
rushed
towards
him
before
he
had
time
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
Mother
,
"
Adam
said
,
rather
hoarsely
,
"
do
n't
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
Father
's
tumbled
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
Belike
we
may
bring
him
round
again
.
<EOS>
Seth
and
me
are
going
to
carry
him
in
.
<EOS>
Get
a
blanket
and
make
it
hot
as
the
fire
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
reality
Adam
was
convinced
that
his
father
was
dead
but
he
knew
there
was
no
other
way
of
repressing
his
mother
's
impetuous
wailing
grief
than
by
occupying
her
with
some
active
task
which
had
hope
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
ran
back
to
Seth
,
and
the
two
sons
lifted
the
sad
burden
in
heart
-
stricken
silence
.
<EOS>
The
wide
-
open
glazed
eyes
were
grey
,
like
Seth
's
,
and
had
once
looked
with
mild
pride
on
the
boys
before
whom
Thias
had
lived
to
hang
his
head
in
shame
.
<EOS>
Seth
's
chief
feeling
was
awe
and
distress
at
this
sudden
snatching
away
of
his
father
's
soul
;
but
Adam
's
mind
rushed
back
over
the
past
in
a
flood
of
relenting
and
pity
.
<EOS>
When
death
,
the
great
Reconciler
,
has
come
,
it
is
never
our
tenderness
that
we
repent
of
,
but
our
severity
.
    
<EOS>
The
Rector
  
<EOS>
BEFORE
twelve
o'clock
there
had
been
some
heavy
storms
of
rain
,
and
the
water
lay
in
deep
gutters
on
the
sides
of
the
gravel
walks
in
the
garden
of
Broxton
Parsonage
;
the
great
Provence
roses
had
been
cruelly
tossed
by
the
wind
and
beaten
by
the
rain
,
and
all
the
delicate
-
stemmed
border
flowers
had
been
dashed
down
and
stained
with
the
wet
soil
.
<EOS>
A
melancholy
morning
 
because
it
was
nearly
time
hay
-
harvest
should
begin
,
and
instead
of
that
the
meadows
were
likely
to
be
flooded
.
  
<EOS>
But
people
who
have
pleasant
homes
get
indoor
enjoyments
that
they
would
never
think
of
but
for
the
rain
.
<EOS>
If
it
had
not
been
a
wet
morning
,
Mr.
Irwine
would
not
have
been
in
the
dining
-
room
playing
at
chess
with
his
mother
,
and
he
loves
both
his
mother
and
chess
quite
well
enough
to
pass
some
cloudy
hours
very
easily
by
their
help
.
<EOS>
Let
me
take
you
into
that
dining
-
room
and
show
you
the
Rev.
Adolphus
Irwine
,
Rector
of
Broxton
,
Vicar
of
Hayslope
,
and
Vicar
of
Blythe
,
a
pluralist
at
whom
the
severest
Church
reformer
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
look
sour
.
<EOS>
We
will
enter
very
softly
and
stand
still
in
the
open
doorway
,
without
awaking
the
glossy
-
brown
setter
who
is
stretched
across
the
hearth
,
with
her
two
puppies
beside
her
;
or
the
pug
,
who
is
dozing
,
with
his
black
muzzle
aloft
,
like
a
sleepy
president
.
  
<EOS>
The
room
is
a
large
and
lofty
one
,
with
an
ample
mullioned
oriel
window
at
one
end
;
the
walls
,
you
see
,
are
new
,
and
not
yet
painted
;
but
the
furniture
,
though
originally
of
an
expensive
sort
,
is
old
and
scanty
,
and
there
is
no
drapery
about
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
crimson
cloth
over
the
large
dining
-
table
is
very
threadbare
,
though
it
contrasts
pleasantly
enough
with
the
dead
hue
of
the
plaster
on
the
walls
;
but
on
this
cloth
there
is
a
massive
silver
waiter
with
a
decanter
of
water
on
it
,
of
the
same
pattern
as
two
larger
ones
that
are
propped
up
on
the
sideboard
with
a
coat
of
arms
conspicuous
in
their
centre
.
<EOS>
You
suspect
at
once
that
the
inhabitants
of
this
room
have
inherited
more
blood
than
wealth
,
and
would
not
be
surprised
to
find
that
Mr.
Irwine
had
a
finely
cut
nostril
and
upper
lip
;
but
at
present
we
can
only
see
that
he
has
a
broad
flat
back
and
an
abundance
of
powdered
hair
,
all
thrown
backward
and
tied
behind
with
a
black
ribbon
 
a
bit
of
conservatism
in
costume
which
tells
you
that
he
is
not
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
He
will
perhaps
turn
round
by
and
by
,
and
in
the
meantime
we
can
look
at
that
stately
old
lady
,
his
mother
,
a
beautiful
aged
brunette
,
whose
rich
-
toned
complexion
is
well
set
off
by
the
complex
wrappings
of
pure
white
cambric
and
lace
about
her
head
and
neck
.
<EOS>
She
is
as
erect
in
her
comely
embonpoint
as
a
statue
of
Ceres
;
and
her
dark
face
,
with
its
delicate
aquiline
nose
,
firm
proud
mouth
,
and
small
,
intense
,
black
eye
,
is
so
keen
and
sarcastic
in
its
expression
that
you
instinctively
substitute
a
pack
of
cards
for
the
chess
-
men
and
imagine
her
telling
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
small
brown
hand
with
which
she
is
lifting
her
queen
is
laden
with
pearls
,
diamonds
,
and
turquoises
;
and
a
large
black
veil
is
very
carefully
adjusted
over
the
crown
of
her
cap
,
and
falls
in
sharp
contrast
on
the
white
folds
about
her
neck
.
<EOS>
It
must
take
a
long
time
to
dress
that
old
lady
in
the
morning
!
<EOS>
But
it
seems
a
law
of
nature
that
she
should
be
dressed
so
:
she
is
clearly
one
of
those
children
of
royalty
who
have
never
doubted
their
right
divine
and
never
met
with
any
one
so
absurd
as
to
question
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
Dauphin
,
tell
me
what
that
is
!
"
<EOS>
says
this
magnificent
old
lady
,
as
she
deposits
her
queen
very
quietly
and
folds
her
arms
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
sorry
to
utter
a
word
disagreeable
to
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
witch
-
mother
,
you
sorceress
!
<EOS>
How
is
a
Christian
man
to
win
a
game
off
you
?
<EOS>
I
should
have
sprinkled
the
board
with
holy
water
before
we
began
.
<EOS>
You
've
not
won
that
game
by
fair
means
,
now
,
so
do
n't
pretend
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
that
's
what
the
beaten
have
always
said
of
great
conquerors
.
<EOS>
But
see
,
there
's
the
sunshine
falling
on
the
board
,
to
show
you
more
clearly
what
a
foolish
move
you
made
with
that
pawn
.
<EOS>
Come
,
shall
I
give
you
another
chance
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mother
,
I
shall
leave
you
to
your
own
conscience
,
now
it
's
clearing
up
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
and
plash
up
the
mud
a
little
,
mus'n't
we
,
Juno
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
was
addressed
to
the
brown
setter
,
who
had
jumped
up
at
the
sound
of
the
voices
and
laid
her
nose
in
an
insinuating
way
on
her
master
's
leg
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
go
upstairs
first
and
see
Anne
.
<EOS>
I
was
called
away
to
Tholer
's
funeral
just
when
I
was
going
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
of
no
use
,
child
;
she
ca
n't
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
Kate
says
she
has
one
of
her
worst
headaches
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
likes
me
to
go
and
see
her
just
the
same
;
she
's
never
too
ill
to
care
about
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
If
you
know
how
much
of
human
speech
is
mere
purposeless
impulse
or
habit
,
you
will
not
wonder
when
I
tell
you
that
this
identical
objection
had
been
made
,
and
had
received
the
same
kind
of
answer
,
many
hundred
times
in
the
course
of
the
fifteen
years
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
sister
Anne
had
been
an
invalid
.
<EOS>
Splendid
old
ladies
,
who
take
a
long
time
to
dress
in
the
morning
,
have
often
slight
sympathy
with
sickly
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
But
while
Mr.
Irwine
was
still
seated
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
and
stroking
Juno
's
head
,
the
servant
came
to
the
door
and
said
,
"
If
you
please
,
sir
,
Joshua
Rann
wishes
to
speak
with
you
,
if
you
are
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
shown
in
here
,
"
said
Mrs.
Irwine
,
taking
up
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
like
to
hear
what
Mr.
Rann
has
got
to
say
.
<EOS>
His
shoes
will
be
dirty
,
but
see
that
he
wipes
them
Carroll
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
two
minutes
Mr.
Rann
appeared
at
the
door
with
very
deferential
bows
,
which
,
however
,
were
far
from
conciliating
Pug
,
who
gave
a
sharp
bark
and
ran
across
the
room
to
reconnoitre
the
stranger
's
legs
;
while
the
two
puppies
,
regarding
Mr.
Rann
's
prominent
calf
and
ribbed
worsted
stockings
from
a
more
sensuous
point
of
view
,
plunged
and
growled
over
them
in
great
enjoyment
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
Mr.
Irwine
turned
round
his
chair
and
said
,
"
Well
,
Joshua
,
anything
the
matter
at
Hayslope
,
that
you
've
come
over
this
damp
morning
?
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
the
dogs
;
give
them
a
friendly
kick
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Pug
,
you
rascal
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
very
pleasant
to
see
some
men
turn
round
;
pleasant
as
a
sudden
rush
of
warm
air
in
winter
,
or
the
flash
of
firelight
in
the
chill
dusk
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
was
one
of
those
men
.
<EOS>
He
bore
the
same
sort
of
resemblance
to
his
mother
that
our
loving
memory
of
a
friend
's
face
often
bears
to
the
face
itself
:
the
lines
were
all
more
generous
,
the
smile
brighter
,
the
expression
heartier
.
<EOS>
If
the
outline
had
been
less
finely
cut
,
his
face
might
have
been
called
jolly
;
but
that
was
not
the
right
word
for
its
mixture
of
bonhomie
and
distinction
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
Your
Reverence
,
"
answered
Mr.
Rann
,
endeavouring
to
look
unconcerned
about
his
legs
,
but
shaking
them
alternately
to
keep
off
the
puppies
;
"
I
'll
stand
,
if
you
please
,
as
more
becoming
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
see
you
an
'
Mrs.
Irwine
<EOS>
well
,
an
'
Miss
Irwine
 
an
'
Miss
Anne
<EOS>
,
I
hope
's
as
well
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Joshua
,
thank
you
.
<EOS>
You
see
how
blooming
my
mother
looks
.
<EOS>
She
beats
us
younger
people
hollow
.
<EOS>
But
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
I
had
to
come
to
Brox'on
to
deliver
some
work
,
and
I
thought
it

<EOS>
right

whether

that

neither

what
I

I
say
 
as
the
young

woman
as
is
at

was

preachin

"

"
Preaching
on
the
Green

said
Mr.
Irwine
,
looking
surprised
but
quite
serene
.
<EOS>
"
What
,
that
pale
pretty
young
woman
I
've
seen
at
Poyser
's
?
<EOS>
I
saw
she
was
a
Methodist
,
or
Quaker
,
or
something
of
that
sort
,
by
her
dress
,
but
I
did
n't
know
she
was
a
preacher
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
true
word
as
I
say
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Rann
,
compressing
his
mouth
into
a
semicircular
form
and
pausing
long
enough
to
indicate
three
notes
of
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
preached
on
the
Green
last
night
;
an
'
she
's
laid
hold
of
Chad
's
Bess
,
as
the
girl
's
been

i

fits

iver

"
  
<EOS>

Well

Bessy
Cranage

a
hearty

looking
lass

I

she
'll
come
round

Did
anybody
else
go
into
fits
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir

I
canna

they
did

But
there

no

extry

theirselves

But
there
's
that
Will
Maskery
,
<EOS>
sir
as
is
the
rampageousest
Methodis
as
can
be
<EOS>
,
an
'
I
make
no
doubt
it
was
him
as
stirred
up
th
'
young
woman
to
preach
last
night
,
an
'
he
'll
be
a

bringin

other
folks
to
preach
from

if
his

is
n't

<EOS>
Well
,
but
you
say
yourself
,
Joshua
,
that
you
never
knew
any
one
come
to
preach
on
the
Green
before
;
why
should
you
think
they
'll
come
again
?
<EOS>
The
Methodists
do
n't
come
to
preach
in
little
villages
like
Hayslope
,
where
there
's
only
a
handful
of
labourers
,
too
tired
to
listen
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
might
almost
as
well
go
and
preach
on
the
Binton
Hills
.
<EOS>
Will
Maskery
is
no
preacher
himself
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sir
,
he
's
no
gift
at
stringin
'
the
words
together
<EOS>
wi'out
book
;
he
'd
be
stuck
fast
like
a
cow
<EOS>
i
'
wet
clay
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
got
tongue
enough
to
speak
disrespectful
about
's
neebors
,
for
he
said
as
I
was
a
blind
Pharisee
 
a
-
usin

<EOS>
the
Bible
<EOS>
i
'
that
way
to
find
nick
-
names
for
folks
as
are
his
elders
an
'
betters
!
 
<EOS>
and
what
's
worse
,
he
's
been
heard
to
say
very
unbecomin
'
words
about
Your
Reverence
;
for
I
could
bring
them
as
'
ud
swear
as
he
called
you
a
"
dumb
dog
,
"
an
'
a
"
idle
shepherd
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
'll
forgi'e
me
for
sayin

such
things
over
again
.

"
<EOS>
Better
not
,
better
not
,
Joshua
.
<EOS>
Let
evil
words
die
as
soon
as
they
're
spoken
.
<EOS>
Will
Maskery
might
be
a
great
deal
worse
fellow
than
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
be
a
wild
drunken
rascal
,
neglecting
his
work
and
beating
his
wife
,
they
told
me
;
now
he
's
thrifty
and
decent
,
and
he
and
his
wife
look
comfortable
together
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
bring
me
any
proof
that
he
interferes
with
his
neighbours
and
creates
any
disturbance
,
I
shall
think
it
my
duty
as
a
clergyman
and
a
magistrate
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
n't
become
wise
people
like
you
and
me
to
be
making
a
fuss
about
trifles
,
as
if
we
thought
the
Church
was
in
danger
because
Will
Maskery
lets
his
tongue
wag
rather
foolishly
,
or
a
young
woman
talks
in
a
serious
way
to
a
handful
of
people
on
the
Green
.
<EOS>
We
must
"
live

live

Joshua

You

Your

To
be

;

you
must
mind

not
lower
the
Church
in
people

eyes
by
seeming
to
be
frightened
about
it
for
a
little
thing

Joshua
.
<EOS>
I
shall
trust
to
your
good
sense
,
now
to
take
no
notice
at
all
of
what
Will
Maskery
says
,
either
about
you
or
me

<EOS>
You
and

can
go
on
taking
your
pot
of
beer
soberly
,
when
you
've
done
your

work
,
like
good
churchmen
;
and
if
Will

does
n't
like
to
join
you
,

to
go
to
a
prayer

meeting
at
Treddleston

that
's
no
business
of
yours

so
long
as
he
does
n't
hinder
you
from
doing
what
you
like
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
people
saying
a
few
idle
words
about
us
,
we
must
not
mind
that
,
any
more
than
the
old
church

steeple
minds
the
rooks
cawing
about

<EOS>
Will
Maskery
comes
to
church
every
Sunday
afternoon
,
and
does
his
wheelwright
's
business
steadily
in
the
weekdays

as
long

<EOS>

Yes

it
turns

much

"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
very
sensible
remark
of
yours
,
Joshua
;
but
,
as
I
said
before
   
"
  
<EOS>
While
Mr.
Irwine
was
speaking
,
the
sound
of
a
booted
step
and
the
clink
of
a
spur
were
heard
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
entrance
-
hall
,
and
Joshua
Rann
moved
hastily
aside
from
the
doorway
to
make
room
for
some
one
who
paused
there
,
and
said
,
in
a
ringing
tenor
voice
,
  
"
<EOS>
Godson
Arthur
 
<EOS>
may
he
come
in
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
in
,
come
in
,
godson
!
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Irwine
answered
,
in
the
deep
half
-
masculine
tone
which
belongs
to
the
vigorous
old
woman
,
and
there
entered
a
young
gentleman
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
with
his
right
arm
in
a
sling
;
whereupon
followed
that
pleasant
confusion
of
laughing
interjections
,
and
hand
-
shakings
,
and
"
How
are
you
's
?
<EOS>
"
mingled
with
joyous
short
barks
and
wagging
of
tails
on
the
part
of
the
canine
members
of
the
family
,
which
tells
that
the
visitor
is
on
the
best
terms
with
the
visited
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
known
in
Hayslope
,
variously
,
as
"
the
young
squire
,
"
"
the
heir
,
"
and
"
the
captain
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
only
a
captain
in
the
Loamshire
Militia
,
but
to
the
Hayslope
tenants
he
was
more
intensely
a
captain
than
all
the
young
gentlemen
of
the
same
rank
in
his
Majesty
's
regulars
 
<EOS>
he
outshone
them
as
the
planet
Jupiter
outshines
the
Milky
Way
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
know
more
particularly
how
he
looked
,
call
to
your
remembrance
some
tawny
-
whiskered
,
brown
-
locked
,
clear
-
complexioned
young
Englishman
whom
you
have
met
with
in
a
foreign
town
,
and
been
proud
of
as
a
fellow
-
countryman
 
well
-
washed
,
high
-
bred
,
white
-
handed
,
yet
looking
as
if
he
could
deliver
well
from
'
the
left
shoulder
and
floor
his
man
:
<EOS>
I
will
not
be
so
much
of
a
tailor
as
to
trouble
your
imagination
with
the
difference
of
costume
,
and
insist
on
the
striped
waistcoat
,
long
-
tailed
coat
,
and
low
top
-
boots
.
  
<EOS>
Turning
round
to
take
a
chair
<EOS>
,
Captain
Donnithorne
said
,
"
But
do
n't
let
me
interrupt
Joshua
's
business
 
<EOS>

has
something
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Humbly
begging
Your
Honour
's
pardon
,
"
said
Joshua
,
bowing
low
,
"
there
was
one
thing
I
had
to
say
to
His
Reverence

particular
t

allow
his

Thorn

she
had

Joshua

go
into
the
kitchen
and
have
some
ale

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
old
Thias

said
Mr.
Irwine
,
when
Joshua
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
the
drink
helped
the
brook
to
drown
him

<EOS>
I
should
have
been
glad
for
the
load
to
have
been
taken
off
my
friend
Adam
's
shoulders
in
a
less
painful
way
.
<EOS>
That
fine
fellow
has
been
propping
up
his
father
from
ruin
for
the
last
five
or
six
years

<EOS>
"
He
's
a
regular
trump
,
is
Adam

"
said
Captain
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
was
a
little
fellow
,
and
Adam
was
a
strapping
lad
of
fifteen
,
and
taught
me
carpentering
,
I
used
to
think
if
ever
I
was
a
rich
sultan
,
I
would
make
Adam
my
grand
-
vizier
.
<EOS>
And
I
believe
now
he
would
bear
the
exaltation
as
well
as
any
poor
wise
man
in
an
Eastern
story
.
<EOS>
If
ever
I
live
to
be
a
large
-
acred
man
instead
of
a
poor
devil
with
a
mortgaged
allowance
of
pocket
-
money
,
I
'll
have
Adam
for
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
He
shall
manage
my
woods
for
me
,
for
he
seems
to
have
a
better
notion
of
those
things
than
any
man
I
ever
met
with
;
and
I
know
he
would
make
twice
the
money
of
them
that
my
grandfather
does
,
with
that
miserable
old
Satchell
to
manage
,
<EOS>
who
understands
no
more
about
timber
than
an
old
carp
.
<EOS>
I
've
mentioned
the
subject
to
my
grandfather
once
or
twice
,
but
for
some
reason
or
other
he
has
a
dislike
to
Adam
,
and
I
can
do
nothing
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
Your
Reverence
,
are
you
for
a
ride
with
me
?
<EOS>
It
's
splendid
out
of
doors
now

<EOS>
We
can
go
to
Adam
's
together
,
if
you
like
;
but
I
want
to
call
at
the
Hall
Farm
on
my
way
,
to
look
at
the
whelps
Poyser
is
keeping
for

I
want

go

Farm

said
Mr.
Irwine
,
"
to
have
another
look
at
the
little
Methodist

Joshua

night

Oh

Captain
Donnithorne

laughing

<EOS>
"
Why

she
looks
as
quiet
as
a
mouse

<EOS>
There
's
something
rather
striking
about
her

though

<EOS>
I
positively
felt
quite
bashful
the
first
time
I
saw
her
 
<EOS>
she
was
sitting
stooping
over
her
sewing
in
the
sunshine
outside
the
house
,
when
I
rode
up
and
called
out
,
without
noticing
that
she
was
a
stranger
,
"
Is
Martin
Poyser
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
I
declare
,
when
she
got
up
and
looked
at
me
and
just
said
,
"
He
's
in
the
house
,
I
believe
:
I
'll
go
and
call
him
,
"
<EOS>
I
felt
quite
ashamed
of
having
spoken
so
abruptly
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
looked
like
St.
Catherine
in
a
Quaker
dress
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
type
of
face
<EOS>
one
rarely
sees
among
our
common
people

<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
see

young
woman

Dauphin

said
Mrs.
Irwine

<EOS>
"
Make
her
come
here
on
some
pretext

other

I
do
n't
know
how
I
can
manage
that

Mother
;
it
will
hardly
do
for
me
to
patronize
a
Methodist
preacher
,
even
if
she
would
consent
to
be
patronized
by
an
idle
shepherd
,
as
Will
Maskery
calls
me
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
come
in
a
little
sooner
,
Arthur
,
to
hear
Joshua
's
denunciation
of
his
neighbour
Will
Maskery
.
<EOS>
The
old
fellow
wants
me
to
excommunicate
the
wheelwright
,
and
then
deliver
him
over
to
the
civil
arm
 
that
is
to
say
,
to
your
grandfather
 
to
be
turned
out
of
house
and
yard
.
<EOS>
If
I
chose
to
interfere
in
this
business
,
now
,
I
might
get
up
as
pretty
a
story
of
hatred
and
persecution
as
the
Methodists
need
desire
to
publish
in
the
next
number
of
their
magazine
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
take
me
much
trouble
to
persuade
Chad
Cranage
and
half
a
dozen
other
bull
-
headed
fellows
that
they
would
be
doing
an
acceptable
service
to
the
Church
by
hunting
Will
Maskery
out
of
the
village
with
rope
-
ends
and
pitchforks
;
and
then
,
when
I
had
furnished
them
with
half
a
sovereign
to
get
gloriously
drunk
after
their
exertions
,
I
should
have
put
the
climax
to
as
pretty
a
farce
as
any
of
my
brother
clergy
have
set
going
in
their
parishes
for
the
last
thirty
years
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
really
insolent
of
the
man
,
though
,
to
call
you
an
"
idle
shepherd
"
and
a
"
dumb
dog
,
"
"
said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
be
inclined
to
check
him
a
little
there
.
<EOS>
You
are
too
easy
-
tempered
,
Dauphin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mother
,
you
do
n't
think
it
would
be
a
good
way
of
sustaining
my
dignity
to
set
about
vindicating
myself
from
the
aspersions
of
Will
Maskery
?
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
'm
not
so
sure
that
they
ARE
aspersions
.
<EOS>
I
AM
a
lazy
fellow
,
and
get
terribly
heavy
in
my
saddle
;
not
to
mention
that
I
'm
always
spending
more
than
I
can
afford
in
bricks
and
mortar
,
so
that
I
get
savage
at
a
lame
beggar
when
he
asks
me
for
sixpence
.
<EOS>
Those
poor
lean
cobblers
,
who
think
they
can
help
to
regenerate
mankind
by
setting
out
to
preach
in
the
morning
twilight
before
they
begin
their
day
's
work
,
may
well
have
a
poor
opinion
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
come
,
let
us
have
our
luncheon
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
Kate
coming
to
lunch
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Miss
Irwine
told
Bridget
to
take
her
lunch
upstairs
,
"
said
Carroll
;
"
she
ca
n't
leave
Miss
Anne
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
.
<EOS>
Tell
Bridget
to
say
I
'll
go
up
and
see
Miss
Anne
presently
.
<EOS>
You
can
use
your
right
arm
quite
well
now
,
Arthur
,
"
Mr.
Irwine
continued
,
observing
that
Captain
Donnithorne
had
taken
his
arm
out
of
the
sling
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
pretty
well
;
but
Godwin
insists
on
my
keeping
it
up
constantly
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
shall
be
able
to
get
away
to
the
regiment
,
though
,
in
the
beginning
of
August
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
desperately
dull
business
being
shut
up
at
the
Chase
in
the
summer
months
,
when
one
can
neither
hunt
nor
shoot
,
so
as
to
make
one
's
self
pleasantly
sleepy
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
are
to
astonish
the
echoes
on
the
30th
of
July
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
has
given
me
carte
blanche
for
once
,
and
I
promise
you
the
entertainment
shall
be
worthy
of
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
world
will
not
see
the
grand
epoch
of
my
majority
twice
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
have
a
lofty
throne
for
you
,
Godmamma
,
or
rather
two
,
one
on
the
lawn
and
another
in
the
ballroom
,
that
you
may
sit
and
look
down
upon
us
like
an
Olympian
goddess
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
bring
out
my
best
brocade
,
that
I
wore
at
your
christening
twenty
years
ago
,
"
said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
think
I
shall
see
your
poor
mother
flitting
about
in
her
white
dress
,
which
looked
to
me
almost
like
a
shroud
that
very
day
;
and
it
WAS
her
shroud
only
three
months
after
;
and
your
little
cap
and
christening
dress
were
buried
with
her
too
.
<EOS>
She
had
set
her
heart
on
that
,
sweet
soul
!
<EOS>
Thank
God
you
take
after
your
mother
's
family
,
Arthur
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
been
a
puny
,
wiry
,
yellow
baby
,
I
would
n't
have
stood
godmother
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
been
sure
you
would
turn
out
a
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
such
a
broad
-
faced
,
broad
-
chested
,
loud
-
screaming
rascal
,
I
knew
you
were
every
inch
of
you
a
Tradgett
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
might
have
been
a
little
too
hasty
there
,
Mother
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
how
it
was
with
Juno
's
last
pups
?
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
the
very
image
of
its
mother
,
but
it
had
two
or
three
of
its
father
's
tricks
notwithstanding
.
<EOS>
Nature
is
clever
enough
to
cheat
even
you
,
Mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
,
child
!
<EOS>
Nature
never
makes
a
ferret
in
the
shape
of
a
mastiff
.
<EOS>
You
'll
never
persuade
me
that
I
ca
n't
tell
what
men
are
by
their
outsides
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
like
a
man
's
looks
,
depend
upon
it
I
shall
never
like
HIM
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
know
people
that
look
ugly
and
disagreeable
,
any
more
than
I
want
to
taste
dishes
that
look
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
If
they
make
me
shudder
at
the
first
glance
,
I
say
,
take
them
away
.
<EOS>
An
ugly
,
piggish
,
or
fishy
eye
,
now
,
makes
me
feel
quite
ill
;
it
's
like
a
bad
smell
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Talking
of
eyes
,
"
said
Captain
Donnithorne
,
"
that
reminds
me
that
I
've
got
a
book
I
meant
to
bring
you
,
Godmamma
.
<EOS>
It
came
down
in
a
parcel
from
London
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
fond
of
queer
,
wizardlike
stories
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
volume
of
poems
,
"
Lyrical
Ballads
.
<EOS>
"
Most
of
them
seem
to
be
twaddling
stuff
,
but
the
first
is
in
a
different
style
 
<EOS>
"
The
Ancient
Mariner
"
is
the
title
.
<EOS>
I
can
hardly
make
head
or
tail
of
it
as
a
story
,
but
it
's
a
strange
,
striking
thing
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
it
over
to
you
;
and
there
are
some
other
books
that
you
may
like
to
see
,
Irwine
 
pamphlets
about
Antinomianism
and
Evangelicalism
,
whatever
they
may
be
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
what
the
fellow
means
by
sending
such
things
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
've
written
to
him
to
desire
that
from
henceforth
he
will
send
me
no
book
or
pamphlet
on
anything
that
ends
in
ISM
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
that
I
'm
very
fond
of
isms
myself
;
but
I
may
as
well
look
at
the
pamphlets
;
they
let
one
see
what
is
going
on
.
<EOS>
I
've
a
little
matter
to
attend
to
,
Arthur
,
"
continued
Mr.
Irwine
,
rising
to
leave
the
room
,
"
and
then
I
shall
be
ready
to
set
out
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
matter
that
Mr.
Irwine
had
to
attend
to
took
him
up
the
old
stone
staircase
(
part
of
the
house
was
very
old
)
and
made
him
pause
before
a
door
at
which
he
knocked
gently
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
said
a
woman
's
voice
,
and
he
entered
a
room
so
darkened
by
blinds
and
curtains
that
Miss
Kate
,
the
thin
middle
-
aged
lady
standing
by
the
bedside
,
would
not
have
had
light
enough
for
any
other
sort
of
work
than
the
knitting
which
lay
on
the
little
table
near
her
.
<EOS>
But
at
present
she
was
doing
what
required
only
the
dimmest
light
 
sponging
the
aching
head
that
lay
on
the
pillow
with
fresh
vinegar
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
face
,
that
of
the
poor
sufferer
;
perhaps
it
had
once
been
pretty
,
but
now
it
was
worn
and
sallow
.
<EOS>
Miss
Kate
came
towards
her
brother
and
whispered
,
"
Do
n't
speak
to
her
;
she
ca
n't
bear
to
be
spoken
to
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
Anne
's
eyes
were
closed
,
and
her
brow
contracted
as
if
from
intense
pain
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
went
to
the
bedside
and
took
up
one
of
the
delicate
hands
and
kissed
it
,
a
slight
pressure
from
the
small
fingers
told
him
that
it
was
worth
-
while
to
have
come
upstairs
for
the
sake
of
doing
that
.
<EOS>
He
lingered
a
moment
,
looking
at
her
,
and
then
turned
away
and
left
the
room
,
treading
very
gently
 
he
had
taken
off
his
boots
and
put
on
slippers
before
he
came
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Whoever
remembers
how
many
things
he
has
declined
to
do
even
for
himself
,
rather
than
have
the
trouble
of
putting
on
or
taking
off
his
boots
,
will
not
think
this
last
detail
insignificant
.
  
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Irwine
's
sisters
,
as
any
person
of
family
within
ten
miles
of
Broxton
could
have
testified
,
were
such
stupid
,
uninteresting
women
!
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
pity
handsome
,
clever
Mrs.
Irwine
should
have
had
such
commonplace
daughters
.
<EOS>
That
fine
old
lady
herself
was
worth
driving
ten
miles
to
see
,
any
day
;
her
beauty
,
her
well
-
preserved
faculties
,
and
her
old
-
fashioned
dignity
made
her
a
graceful
subject
for
conversation
in
turn
with
the
King
's
health
,
the
sweet
new
patterns
in
cotton
dresses
,
the
news
from
Egypt
,
and
Lord
Dacey
's
lawsuit
,
which
was
fretting
poor
Lady
Dacey
to
death
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
ever
thought
of
mentioning
the
Miss
Irwines
,
except
the
poor
people
in
Broxton
village
,
who
regarded
them
as
deep
in
the
science
of
medicine
,
and
spoke
of
them
vaguely
as
"
the
gentlefolks
.
<EOS>
"
If
any
one
had
asked
old
Job
Dummilow
who
gave
him
his
flannel
jacket
,
he
would
have
answered
,
"
the
gentlefolks
,
last
winter
"
;
and
widow
Steene
dwelt
much
on
the
virtues
of
the
"
stuff
"
the
gentlefolks
gave
her
for
her
cough
.
<EOS>
Under
this
name
too
,
they
were
used
with
great
effect
as
a
means
of
taming
refractory
children
,
so
that
at
the
sight
of
poor
Miss
Anne
's
sallow
face
,
several
small
urchins
had
a
terrified
sense
that
she
was
cognizant
of
all
their
worst
misdemeanours
,
and
knew
the
precise
number
of
stones
with
which
they
had
intended
to
hit
Farmer
Britton
's
ducks
.
<EOS>
But
for
all
who
saw
them
through
a
less
mythical
medium
,
the
Miss
Irwines
were
quite
superfluous
existences
 
inartistic
figures
crowding
the
canvas
of
life
without
adequate
effect
.
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
,
indeed
,
if
her
chronic
headaches
could
have
been
accounted
for
by
a
pathetic
story
of
disappointed
love
,
might
have
had
some
romantic
interest
attached
to
her
:
but
no
such
story
had
either
been
known
or
invented
concerning
her
,
and
the
general
impression
was
quite
in
accordance
with
the
fact
,
that
both
the
sisters
were
old
maids
for
the
prosaic
reason
that
they
had
never
received
an
eligible
offer
.
  
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
to
speak
paradoxically
,
the
existence
of
insignificant
people
has
very
important
consequences
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
can
be
shown
to
affect
the
price
of
bread
and
the
rate
of
wages
,
to
call
forth
many
evil
tempers
from
the
selfish
and
many
heroisms
from
the
sympathetic
,
and
,
in
other
ways
,
to
play
no
small
part
in
the
tragedy
of
life
.
<EOS>
And
if
that
handsome
,
generous
-
blooded
clergyman
,
the
Rev.
Adolphus
Irwine
,
had
not
had
these
two
hopelessly
maiden
sisters
,
his
lot
would
have
been
shaped
quite
differently
:
he
would
very
likely
have
taken
a
comely
wife
in
his
youth
,
and
now
,
when
his
hair
was
getting
grey
under
the
powder
,
would
have
had
tall
sons
and
blooming
daughters
 
such
possessions
,
in
short
,
as
men
commonly
think
will
repay
them
for
all
the
labour
they
take
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
 
having
with
all
his
three
livings
no
more
than
seven
hundred
a
-
year
,
and
seeing
no
way
of
keeping
his
splendid
mother
and
his
sickly
sister
,
not
to
reckon
a
second
sister
,
who
was
usually
spoken
of
without
any
adjective
,
in
such
ladylike
ease
as
became
their
birth
and
habits
,
and
at
the
same
time
providing
for
a
family
of
his
own
 
<EOS>
he
remained
,
you
see
,
at
the
age
of
eight
-
and
-
forty
,
a
bachelor
,
not
making
any
merit
of
that
renunciation
,
but
saying
laughingly
,
if
any
one
alluded
to
it
,
that
he
made
it
an
excuse
for
many
indulgences
which
a
wife
would
never
have
allowed
him
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
did
not
think
his
sisters
uninteresting
and
superfluous
;
for
his
was
one
of
those
large
-
hearted
,
sweet
-
blooded
natures
that
never
know
a
narrow
or
a
grudging
thought
;
Epicurean
,
if
you
will
,
with
no
enthusiasm
,
no
self
-
scourging
sense
of
duty
;
but
yet
,
as
you
have
seen
,
of
a
sufficiently
subtle
moral
fibre
to
have
an
unwearying
tenderness
for
obscure
and
monotonous
suffering
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
large
-
hearted
indulgence
that
made
him
ignore
his
mother
's
hardness
towards
her
daughters
,
which
was
the
more
striking
from
its
contrast
with
her
doting
fondness
towards
himself
;
he
held
it
no
virtue
to
frown
at
irremediable
faults
.
  
<EOS>
See
the
difference
between
the
impression
a
man
makes
on
you
when
you
walk
by
his
side
in
familiar
talk
,
or
look
at
him
in
his
home
,
and
the
figure
he
makes
when
seen
from
a
lofty
historical
level
,
or
even
in
the
eyes
of
a
critical
neighbour
who
thinks
of
him
as
an
embodied
system
or
opinion
rather
than
as
a
man
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Roe
,
the
"
travelling
preacher
"
stationed
at
Treddleston
,
had
included
Mr.
Irwine
in
a
general
statement
concerning
the
Church
clergy
in
the
surrounding
district
,
whom
he

as
men
given
up
to
the

of
the

<EOS>
careless
of
dispensing
the
bread
of
life
to
their
flocks
,
preaching
at
best
but
a
carnal
and
soul
-
benumbing
morality
,
and
trafficking
in
the
souls
of
men
by
receiving
money
for
discharging
the
pastoral
office
in
parishes
where
they
did
not
so
much
as
look
on
the
faces
of
the
people
more
than
once
a
-
year
.
<EOS>
The
ecclesiastical
historian
,
too
,
looking
into
parliamentary
reports
of
that
period
,
finds
honourable
members
zealous
for
the
Church
,
and
untainted
with
any
sympathy
for
the
"
tribe
of
canting
Methodists
,
"
making
statements
scarcely
less
melancholy
than
that
of
Mr.
Roe
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
say
that
Mr.
Irwine
was
altogether
belied
by
the
generic
classification
assigned
him
.
<EOS>
He
really
had
no
very
lofty
aims
,
no
theological
enthusiasm
:
if
I
were
closely
questioned
,
I
should
be
obliged
to
confess
that
he
felt
no
serious
alarms
about
the
souls
of
his
parishioners
,
and
would
have
thought
it
a
mere
loss
of
time
to
talk
in
a
doctrinal
and
awakening
manner
to
old
"
Feyther
Taft
,
"
or
even
to
Chad
Cranage
the
blacksmith
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
in
the
habit
of
speaking
theoretically
,
he
would
perhaps
have
said
that
the
only
healthy
form
religion
could
take
in
such
minds
<EOS>
was
that
of
certain
dim
but
strong
emotions
,
suffusing
themselves
as
a
hallowing
influence
over
the
family
affections
and
neighbourly
duties
.
<EOS>
He
thought
the
custom
of
baptism
more
important
than
its
doctrine
,
and
that
the
religious
benefits
the
peasant
drew
from
the
church
where
his
fathers
worshipped
and
the
sacred
piece
of
turf
where
they
lay
buried
were
but
slightly
dependent
on
a
clear
understanding
of
the
Liturgy
or
the
sermon
.
<EOS>
Clearly
the
rector
was
not
what
is
called
in
these
days
an
"
earnest
"
man
:
he
was
fonder
of
church
history
than
of
divinity
,
and
had
much
more
insight
into
men
's
characters
than
interest
in
their
opinions
;
he
was
neither
laborious
,
nor
obviously
self
-
denying
,
nor
very
copious
in
alms
-
giving
,
and
his
theology
,
you
perceive
,
was
lax
.
<EOS>
His
mental
palate
,
indeed
,
was
rather
pagan
,
and
found
a
savouriness
in
a
quotation
from
Sophocles
or
Theocritus
that
was
quite
absent
from
any
text
in
Isaiah
or
Amos
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
feed
your
young
setter
on
raw
flesh
,
how
can
you
wonder
at
its
retaining
a
relish
for
uncooked
partridge
in
after
-
life
?
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Irwine
's
recollections
of
young
enthusiasm
and
ambition
were
all
associated
with
poetry
and
ethics
that
lay
aloof
from
the
Bible
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
I
must
plead
,
for
I
have
an
affectionate
partiality
towards
the
rector
's
memory
,
that
he
was
not
vindictive
 
and
some
philanthropists
have
been
so
;
that
he
was
not
intolerant
 
and
there
is
a
rumour
that
some
zealous
theologians
have
not
been
altogether
free
from
that
blemish
;
that
although
he
would
probably
have
declined
to
give
his
body
to
be
burned
in
any
public
cause
,
and
was
far
from
bestowing
all
his
goods
to
feed
the
poor
,
he
had
that
charity
which
has
sometimes
been
lacking
to
very
illustrious
virtue
 
<EOS>
he
was
tender
to
other
men
's
failings
,
and
unwilling
to
impute
evil
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
men
,
and
they
are
not
the
commonest
,
of
whom
we
can
know
the
best
only
by
following
them
away
from
the
marketplace
,
the
platform
,
and
the
pulpit
,
entering
with
them
into
their
own
homes
,
hearing
the
voice
with
which
they
speak
to
the
young
and
aged
about
their
own
hearthstone
,
and
witnessing
their
thoughtful
care
for
the
everyday
wants
of
everyday
companions
,
who
take
all
their
kindness
as
a
matter
of
course
,
and
not
as
a
subject
for
panegyric
.
  
<EOS>
Such
men
,
happily
,
have
lived
in
times
when
great
abuses
flourished
,
and
have
sometimes
even
been
the
living
representatives
of
the
abuses
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
thought
which
might
comfort
us
a
little
under
the
opposite
fact
 
that
it
is
better
sometimes
NOT
to
follow
great
reformers
of
abuses
beyond
the
threshold
of
their
homes
.
  
<EOS>
But
whatever
you
may
think
of
Mr.
Irwine
now
,
if
you
had
met
him
that
June
afternoon
riding
on
his
grey
cob
,
with
his
dogs
running
beside
him
 
portly
,
upright
,
manly
,
with
a
good
-
natured
smile
on
his
finely
turned
lips
as
he
talked
to
his
dashing
young
companion
on
the
bay
mare
,
you
must
have
felt
that
,
however
ill
he
harmonized
with
sound
theories
of
the
clerical
office
,
he
somehow
harmonized
extremely
well
with
that
peaceful
landscape
.
  
<EOS>
See
them
in
the
bright
sunlight
,
interrupted
every
now
and
then
by
rolling
masses
of
cloud
,
ascending
the
slope
from
the
Broxton
side
,
where
the
tall
gables
and
elms
of
the
rectory
predominate
over
the
tiny
whitewashed
church
.
<EOS>
They
will
soon
be
in
the
parish
of
Hayslope
;
the
grey
church
-
tower
and
village
roofs
lie
before
them
to
the
left
,
and
farther
on
,
to
the
right
<EOS>
,
they
can
just
see
the
chimneys
of
the
Hall
Farm
.
    
<EOS>
The
Hall
Farm
  
EVIDENTLY
that
gate
is
never
opened
,
for
the
long
grass
and
<EOS>
the
great
hemlocks
grow
close
against
it
,
and
if
it
were
opened
,
it
is
so
rusty
that
the
force
necessary
to
turn
it
on
its
hinges
would
be
likely
to
pull
down
the
square
stone
-
built
pillars
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
two
stone
lionesses
which
grin
with
a
doubtful
carnivorous
affability
above
a
coat
of
arms
surmounting
each
of
the
pillars
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
easy
enough
,
by
the
aid
of
the
nicks
in
the
stone
pillars
,
to
climb
over
the
brick
wall
with
its
smooth
stone
coping
;
but
by
putting
our
eyes
close
to
the
rusty
bars
of
the
gate
,
we
can
see
the
house
well
enough
,
and
all
but
the
very
corners
of
the
grassy
enclosure
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
a
very
fine
old
place
,
of
red
brick
,
softened
by
a
pale
powdery
lichen
,
which
has
dispersed
itself
with
happy
irregularity
,
so
as
to
bring
the
red
brick
into
terms
of
friendly
companionship
with
the
limestone
ornaments
surrounding
the
three
gables
,
the
windows
,
and
the
door
-
place
.
<EOS>
But
the
windows
are
patched
with
wooden
panes
,
and
the
door
,
I
think
,
is
like
the
gate
 
it
is
never
opened
.
<EOS>
How
it
would
groan
and
grate
against
the
stone
floor
if
it
were
!
<EOS>
For
it
is
a
solid
,
heavy
,
handsome
door
,
and
must
once
have
been
in
the
habit
of
shutting
with
a
sonorous
bang
behind
a
liveried
lackey
,
who
had
just
seen
his
master
and
mistress
off
the
grounds
in
a
carriage
and
pair
.
  
<EOS>
But
at
present
one
might
fancy
the
house
in
the
early
stage
of
a
chancery
suit
,
and
that
the
fruit
from
that
grand
double
row
of
walnut
-
trees
on
the
right
hand
of
the
enclosure
would
fall
and
rot
among
the
grass
,
if
it
were
not
that
we
heard
the
booming
bark
of
dogs
echoing
from
great
buildings
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
half
-
weaned
calves
that
have
been
sheltering
themselves
in
a
gorse
-
built
hovel
against
the
left
-
hand
wall
come
out
and
set
up
a
silly
answer
to
that
terrible
bark
,
doubtless
supposing
that
it
has
reference
to
buckets
of
milk
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
the
house
must
be
inhabited
,
and
we
will
see
by
whom
;
for
imagination
is
a
licensed
trespasser
:
it
has
no
fear
of
dogs
,
but
may
climb
over
walls
and
peep
in
at
windows
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
Put
your
face
to
one
of
the
glass
panes
in
the
right
-
hand
window
:
what
do
you
see
?
<EOS>
A
large
open
fireplace
,
with
rusty
dogs
in
it
,
and
a
bare
boarded
floor
;
at
the
far
end
,
fleeces
of
wool
stacked
up
;
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
some
empty
corn
-
bags
.
<EOS>
That
is
the
furniture
of
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
And
what
through
the
left
-
hand
window
?
<EOS>
Several
clothes
-
horses
,
a
pillion
,
a
spinning
-
wheel
,
and
an
old
box
wide
open
and
stuffed
full
of
coloured
rags
.
<EOS>
At
the
edge
of
this
box
there
lies
a
great
wooden
doll
,
which
,
so
far
as
mutilation
is
concerned
,
bears
a
strong
resemblance
to
the
finest
Greek
sculpture
,
and
especially
in
the
total
loss
of
its
nose
.
<EOS>
Near
it
there
is
a
little
chair
,
and
the
butt
end
of
a
boy
's
leather
long
-
lashed
whip
.
  
<EOS>
The
history
of
the
house
is
plain
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
once
the
residence
of
a
country
squire
,
whose
family
,
probably
dwindling
down
to
mere
spinsterhood
,
got
merged
in
the
more
territorial
name
of
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
It
was
once
the
Hall
;
it
is
now
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
Like
the
life
in
some
coast
town
that
was
once
a
watering
-
place
,
and
is
now
a
port
,
where
the
genteel
streets
are
silent
and
grass
-
grown
,
and
the
docks
and
warehouses
busy
and
resonant
,
the
life
at
the
Hall
has
changed
its
focus
,
and
no
longer
radiates
from
the
parlour
,
but
from
the
kitchen
and
the
farmyard
.
  
<EOS>
Plenty
of
life
there
,
though
this
is
the
drowsiest
time
of
the
year
,
just
before
hay
-
harvest
;
and
it
is
the
drowsiest
time
of
the
day
too
,
for
it
is
close
upon
three
by
the
sun
,
and
it
is
<EOS>
half
-
past
three
by
Mrs.
Poyser
's
handsome
eight
-
day
clock
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
always
a
stronger
sense
of
life
when
the
sun
is
brilliant
after
rain
;
and
now
he
is
pouring
down
his
beams
,
and
making
sparkles
among
the
wet
straw
,
and
lighting
up
every
patch
of
vivid
green
moss
on
the
red
tiles
of
the
cow
-
shed
,
and
turning
even
the
muddy
water
that
is
hurrying
along
the
channel
to
the
drain
into
a
mirror
for
the
yellow
-
billed
ducks
,
who
are
seizing
the
opportunity
of
getting
a
drink
with
as
much
body
in
it
as
possible
.
<EOS>
There
is
quite
a
concert
of
noises
;
the
great
bull
-
dog
,
chained
against
the
stables
,
is
thrown
into
furious
exasperation
by
the
unwary
approach
of
a
cock
too
near
the
mouth
of
his
kennel
,
and
sends
forth
a
thundering
bark
,
which
is
answered
by
two
fox
-
hounds
shut
up
in
the
opposite
cow
-
house
;
the
old
top
-
knotted
hens
,
scratching
with
their
chicks
among
the
straw
,
set
up
a
sympathetic
croaking
as
the
discomfited
cock
joins
them
;
a
sow
with
her
brood
,
all
very
muddy
as
to
the
legs
,
and
curled
as
to
the
tail
,
throws
in
some
deep
staccato
notes
;
our
friends
the
calves
are
bleating
from
the
home
croft
;
and
,
under
all
,
a
fine
ear
discerns
the
continuous
hum
of
human
voices
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
great
barn
-
doors
are
thrown
wide
open
,
and
men
are
busy
there
mending
the
harness
,
under
the
superintendence
of
Mr.
Goby
,
the
"
whittaw
,
"
otherwise
saddler
,
who
entertains
them
with
the
latest
Treddleston
gossip
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
rather
an
unfortunate
day
that
Alick
,
the
shepherd
,
has
chosen
for
having
the
whittaws
,
since
the
morning
turned
out
so
wet
;
and
Mrs.
Poyser
has
spoken
her
mind
pretty
strongly
as
to
the
dirt
which
the
extra
number
of
men
's
shoes
brought
into
the
house
at
dinnertime
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
has
not
yet
recovered
her
equanimity
on
the
subject
,
though
it
is
now
nearly
three
hours
since
dinner
,
and
the
house
-
floor
is
perfectly
clean
again
;
as
clean
as
everything
else
in
that
wonderful
house
-
place
,
where
the
only
chance
of
collecting
a
few
grains
of
dust
would
be
to
climb
on
the
salt
-
coffer
,
and
put
your
finger
on
the
high
mantel
-
shelf
on
which
the
glittering
brass
candlesticks
are
enjoying
their
summer
sinecure
;
for
at
this
time
of
year
,
of
course
,
every
one
goes
to
bed
while
it
is
yet
light
,
or
at
least
light
enough
to
discern
the
outline
of
objects
after
you
have
bruised
your
shins
against
them
.
<EOS>
Surely
nowhere
else
could
an
oak
clock
-
case
and
an
oak
table
have
got
to
such
a
polish
by
the
hand
:
genuine
"
elbow
polish
,
"
as
Mrs.
Poyser
called
it
,
for
she
thanked
God
<EOS>
she
never
had
any
of
your
varnished
rubbish
in
her
house
.
<EOS>
Hetty
Sorrel
often
took
the
opportunity
,
when
her
aunt
's
back
was
turned
,
of
looking
at
the
pleasing
reflection
of
herself
in
those
polished
surfaces
,
for
the
oak
table
was
usually
turned
up
like
a
screen
,
and
was
more
for
ornament
than
for
use
;
and
she
could
see
herself
sometimes
in
the
great
round
pewter
dishes
that
were
ranged
on
the
shelves
above
the
long
deal
dinner
-
table
,
or
in
the
hobs
of
the
grate
,
which
always
shone
like
jasper
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
was
looking
at
its
brightest
at
this
moment
,
for
the
sun
shone
right
on
the
pewter
dishes
,
and
from
their
reflecting
surfaces
pleasant
jets
of
light
were
thrown
on
mellow
oak
and
bright
brass
 
and
on
a
still
pleasanter
object
than
these
,
for
some
of
the
rays
fell
on
Dinah
's
finely
moulded
cheek
,
and
lit
up
her
pale
red
hair
to
auburn
,
as
she
bent
over
the
heavy
household
linen
which
she
was
mending
for
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
No
scene
could
have
been
more
peaceful
,
if
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
ironing
a
few
things
that
still
remained
from
the
Monday
's
wash
,
had
not
been
making
a
frequent
clinking
with
her
iron
and
moving
to
and
fro
whenever
she
wanted
it
to
cool
;
carrying
the
keen
glance
of
her
blue
-
grey
eye
from
the
kitchen
to
the
dairy
,
where
Hetty
was
making
up
the
butter
,
and
from
the
dairy
to
the
back
kitchen
,
where
Nancy
was
taking
the
pies
out
of
the
oven
.
<EOS>
Do
not
suppose
,
however
,
that
Mrs.
Poyser
was
elderly
or
shrewish
in
her
appearance
;
she
was
a
good
-
looking
woman
,
not
more
than
eight
-
and
-
thirty
,
of
fair
complexion
and
sandy
hair
,
well
-
shapen
,
light
-
footed
.
<EOS>
The
most
conspicuous
article
in
her
attire
was
an
ample
checkered
linen
apron
,
which
almost
covered
her
skirt
;
and
nothing
could
be
plainer
or
less
noticeable
than
her
cap
and
gown
,
for
there
was
no
weakness
of
which
she
was
less
tolerant
than
feminine
vanity
,
and
the
preference
of
ornament
to
utility
.
<EOS>
The
family
likeness
between
her
and
her
niece
Dinah
Morris
,
with
the
contrast
between
her
keenness
and
Dinah
's
seraphic
gentleness
of
expression
,
might
have
served
a
painter
as
an
excellent
suggestion
for
a
Martha
and
Mary
.
<EOS>
Their
eyes
were
just
of
the
same
colour
,
but
a
striking
test
of
the
difference
in
their
operation
was
seen
in
the
demeanour
of
Trip
,
the
black
-
and
-
tan
terrier
,
whenever
that
much
-
suspected
dog
unwarily
exposed
himself
to
the
freezing
arctic
ray
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
glance
.
<EOS>
Her
tongue
was
not
less
keen
than
her
eye
,
and
,
whenever
a
damsel
came
within
earshot
,
seemed
to
take
up
an
unfinished
lecture
,
as
a
barrel
-
organ
takes
up
a
tune
,
precisely
at
the
point
where
it
had
left
off
.
  
<EOS>
The
fact
that
it
was
churning
day
was
another
reason
why
it
was
inconvenient
to
have
the
whittaws
,
and
why
,
consequently
,
Mrs.
Poyser
should
scold
Molly
the
housemaid
with
unusual
severity
.
<EOS>
To
all
appearance
Molly
had
got
through
her
after
-
dinner
work
in
an
exemplary
manner
,
had
"
cleaned
herself
"
with
great
dispatch
,
and
now
came
to
ask
,
submissively
,
if
she
should
sit
down
to
her
spinning
till
milking
time
.
<EOS>
But
this
blameless
conduct
,
according
to
Mrs.
Poyser
,
shrouded
a
secret
indulgence
of
unbecoming
wishes
,
which
she
now
dragged
forth
and
held
up
to
Molly
's
view
with
cutting
eloquence
.

"
Spinning

<EOS>
It

I

To

<EOS>
And
you
,
as
have
been
here
ever

I
hired
you
at

I

,
you
might
be
grateful

be

wasted
as
much
as
your

<EOS>
i

the
flax
you

spoiled

<EOS>
And
you

quite
overcome
by

Dantean

of

I
never

<EOS>
The
small
chirruping
voice
that
uttered
this
request
came
from
a
little
sunny
-
haired
girl
between
three
and
four
,
who
,
seated
on
a
high
chair
at
the
end
of
the
ironing
table
,
was
arduously
clutching
the
handle
of
a
miniature
iron
with
her
tiny
fat
fist
,
and
ironing
rags
with
an
assiduity
that
required
her
to
put
her
little
red
tongue
out
as
far
as
anatomy
would
allow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cold
,
is
it

my
darling

<EOS>
Bless

"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
remarkable
for
the
facility
with
which
she
could
relapse
from
her
official
objurgatory
to
one
of
fondness
or
of
friendly
converse
.
<EOS>
"
Never

"

"
rejoined
Totty
,
who
seemed
to
be
provided
with
several
relays
of
requests
;
at
the
same
time
,
taking
the
opportunity
of
her
momentary
leisure
to
put
her
fingers
into
a
bowl
of
starch
,
and
drag
it
down
so
as
to
empty
the
contents
with
tolerable
completeness
on
to
the
ironing
sheet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
ever
anybody
see
the
like
?
"
screamed
Mrs.
Poyser
,
running
towards
the
table
when
her
eye
had
fallen
on
the
blue
stream
.
<EOS>
"
The
child
's
allays
i

mischief
if

What

you

you
naughty

naughty

"
  
<EOS>
Totty
,
however
,
had
descended
from
her
chair
with
great
swiftness
,
and
was
already
in
retreat
towards
the
dairy
with
a
sort
of
waddling
run
,
and
an
amount
of
fat
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
which
made
her
look
like
the
metamorphosis
of
a
white
suckling
pig
.
  
<EOS>
The
starch
having
been
wiped
up
by
Molly
's
help
,
and
the
ironing
apparatus
put
by
,
Mrs.
Poyser
took
up
her
knitting
which
always
lay
ready
at
hand
,
and
was
the
work
she
liked
best
,
because
she
could
carry
it
on
automatically
as
she
walked
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
came
and
sat
down
opposite
Dinah
,
whom
she
looked
at
in
a
meditative
way
,
as
she
knitted
her
grey
worsted
stocking
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
th
'
image
o
'
your
Aunt
Judith
,
Dinah
,
when
you
sit
a
-
sewing
.
<EOS>
I
could
almost
fancy
<EOS>
it
was
thirty
years
back
,
and
I
was
a
little
gell
at
home
,
looking
at
Judith
as
she
sat
at
her
work
,
after
she
'd
done
the
house
up
;
only
it
was
a
little
cottage
,
Father
's
was
,
and
not
a
big
rambling
house
as
gets
dirty
<EOS>
i
'
one
corner
as
fast
as
you
clean
it
in
another
 
but
for
all
that
<EOS>
,
I
could
fancy
<EOS>
you
was
your
Aunt
Judith
,
only
her
hair
was
a
deal
darker
than
yours
,
and
she
was
stouter
and
broader
<EOS>
i
'
the
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Judith
and
me
allays
hung
together
,
though
she
had
such
queer
ways
,
but
your
mother
and
her
never
could
agree
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
your
mother
little
thought
as
she
'd
have
a
daughter
just
cut
out
after
the
very
pattern
<EOS>
o
'
Judith
,
and
leave
her
an
orphan
,
too
,
for
Judith
to
take
care
on
,
and
bring
up
with
a
spoon
when
SHE
was
in
the
graveyard
at
Stoniton
.
<EOS>
I
allays
said
that
o
'
Judith
,
as
she
'd
bear
a
pound
weight
any
day
to
save
anybody
else
carrying
a
ounce
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
just
the
same
from
the
first
o
'
my
remembering
her
;
it
made
no
difference
in
her
,
as
I
could
see
,
when
she
took
to
the
Methodists
,
only
she
talked
a
bit
different
and
wore
a
different
sort
o
'
cap
;
but
she
'd
never
in
her
life
spent
a
penny
on
herself
more
than
keeping
herself
decent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
a
blessed
woman
,
"
said
Dinah
;
<EOS>
"
God
had
given
her
a
loving
,
self
-
forgetting
nature
,
and
He
perfected
it
by
grace
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
very
fond
of
you
too
,
Aunt
Rachel
.
<EOS>
I
often
heard
her
talk
of
you
in
the
same
sort
of
way
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
that
bad
illness
,
and
I
was
only
eleven
years
old
,
she
used
to
say
,
"
You
'll
have
a
friend
on
earth
in
your
Aunt
Rachel
,
if
I
'm
taken
from
you
,
for
she
has
a
kind
heart
,
"
and
I
'm
sure
I
've
found
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
how
,
child
;
anybody
'
ud
be
cunning
to
do
anything
for
you

I
think
;
you
're

<EOS>
I
'd
ha

been
glad

behave
to
you
like
a

if
you

come

live

i

this
country
where
there
's
some
shelter

victual
for
man

folks
do
n't
live
on
the
naked
hills

poultry

And
then
you

there
'd
be
plenty
ready

have
you

only
leave
off
that
preaching

as
is
ten
times
worse
than
anything
your
Aunt
Judith
ever
did

<EOS>
And
even
if
you
'd
marry
Seth
Bede
,
as
is
a
poor
wool

gathering
Methodist
and
's
never
like
to

<EOS>
beforehand

I
know
your

as

<EOS>
And
there
's
linen
in
the
house
as
I
could
well
spare
you

for
I
've
got
lots
o

<EOS>
There
's
a
piece

sheeting
I
could
give
you
as
that
squinting
Kitty
spun
 
<EOS>
she
was
a
rare
girl
to

for
all
she
squinted

and
the

n't
abide
her

and
,
you

the
spinning
's
going
on
constant

and
there
's
new
linen
wove
twice
as
fast
as

out

<EOS>
But
where
's
the
use
<EOS>
o

talking
,
if
ye
wonna

down
like

"
<EOS>
Yes

Mrs.

rather

else
why
should

them

tried
to
do
without
house
and
home
,
and
with
poor
eating
and
drinking
,
and
was
allays
talking
as
we
must
despise
the
things
<EOS>
o
'
the
world
as
you
say
,
I
should
like
to
know
where
the
pick
o
'
the
stock
,
and
the
corn
,
and
the
best
new
-
milk
cheeses
'
ud
have
to
go
.
<EOS>
Everybody
'
ud
be
wanting
bread
made
o
'
tail
ends
<EOS>
and
everybody
'
ud
be
running
after
everybody
else
to
preach
to
'em
<EOS>
,
istead
o
'
bringing
up
their
families
,
and
laying
by
against
a
bad
harvest
.
<EOS>
It
stands
to
sense
as
that
ca
n't
be
the
right
religion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
dear
aunt
,
you
never
heard
me
say
that
all
people
are
called
to
forsake
their
work
and
their
families
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
right
<EOS>
the
land
should
be
ploughed
and
sowed
,
and
the
precious
corn
stored
,
and
the
things
of
this
life
cared
for
,
and
right
that
people
should
rejoice
in
their
families
,
and
provide
for
them
,
so
that
this
is
done
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord
,
and
that
they
are
not
unmindful
of
the
soul
's
wants
while
they
are
caring
for
the
body
.
<EOS>
We
can
all
be
servants
of
God
wherever
our
lot
is
cast
,
but
He
gives
us
different
sorts
of
work
,
according
as
He
fits
us
for
it
and
calls
us
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
no
more
help
spending
my
life
in
trying
to
do
what
I
can
for
the
souls
of
others
,
than
you
could
help
running
if
you
heard
little
Totty
crying
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
;
the
voice
would
go
to
your
heart
,
you
would
think
the
dear
child
was
in
trouble
or
in
danger
,
and
you
could
n't
rest
without
running
to
help
her
and
comfort
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
rising
and
walking
towards
the
door
,
"
I
know
it
'
ud
be
just
the
same
if
I
was
to
talk
to
you
for
hours
.
<EOS>
You
'd
make
me
the
same
answer
,
at
th
'
end
.
<EOS>
I
might
as
well
talk
to
the
running
brook
and
tell
it
to
stan
'
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
causeway
outside
the
kitchen
door
was
dry
enough
now
for
Mrs.
Poyser
to
stand
there
quite
pleasantly
and
see
what
was
going
on
in
the
yard
,
the
grey
worsted
stocking
making
a
steady
progress
in
her
hands
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
But
she
had
not
been
standing
there
more
than
five
minutes
before
she
came
in
again
,
and
said
to
Dinah
,
in
rather
a
flurried
,
awe
-
stricken
tone
,
"
<EOS>
If
there
is
n't
Captain
Donnithorne
and
Mr.
Irwine
a
-
coming
into
the
yard
!
<EOS>
I
'll
lay
my
life
<EOS>
they
're
come
to
speak
about
your
preaching
on
the
Green
,
Dinah
;
it
's
you
must
answer
'em
,
<EOS>
for
I
'm
dumb
.
<EOS>
I
've
said
enough
a'ready
about
your
bringing
such
disgrace
upo
'
your
uncle
's
family
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
ha
'
minded
if
you
'd
been
Mr.
Poyser
's
own
niece
 
<EOS>
folks
must
put
up
wi
'
their
own
kin
,
as
they
put
up
wi
'
their
own
noses
 
<EOS>
it
's
their
own
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
But
to
think
of
a
niece
o
'
mine
being
cause
o
'
my
husband
's
being
turned
out
of
his
farm
,
and
me
brought
him
no
fortin
<EOS>
but
my
savin
's
   
"
  
"
Nay
,
dear
Aunt
Rachel
,
"
said
Dinah
gently
,
"
<EOS>
you
've
no
cause
for
such
fears
.
<EOS>
I
've
strong
assurance
that
no
evil
will
happen
to
you
and
my
uncle
and
the
children
from
anything
I
've
done
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
preach
without
direction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Direction
!
<EOS>
I
know
very
well
what
you
mean
by
direction
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
knitting
in
a
rapid
and
agitated
manner
.
<EOS>
"
When
there
's
a
bigger
maggot
than
usual
in
your
head
<EOS>
you
call
it
"
direction
"
;
<EOS>
and
then
nothing
can
stir
you
 
<EOS>
you
look
like
the
statty
o
'
the
outside
o
'
Treddles'on
church
,
a
-
starin
'
and
a
-
smilin

whether
it
's
fair
weather
or
foul
.
<EOS>
I
hanna
common
patience
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
two
gentlemen
had
reached
the
palings
and
had
got
down
from
their
horses
:
it
was
plain
they
meant
to
come
in
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
advanced
to
the
door
to
meet
them
,
curtsying
low
and
trembling
between
anger
with
Dinah
and
anxiety
to
conduct
herself
with
perfect
propriety
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
For
in
those
days
the
keenest
of
bucolic
minds
felt
a
whispering
awe
at
the
sight
of
the
gentry
,
such
as
of
old
men
felt
when
they
stood
on
tiptoe
to
watch
the
gods
passing
by
in
tall
human
shape
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
how
are
you
after
this
stormy
morning
?
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
his
stately
cordiality
.
<EOS>
"
Our
feet
are
quite
dry
;
we
shall
not
soil
your
beautiful
floor
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
do
n't
mention
it
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
and
the
captain
please
to
walk
into
the
parlour
?
"
  
"
No
,
indeed
,
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
said
the
captain
,
looking
eagerly
round
the
kitchen
,
as
if
his
eye
were
seeking
something
it
could
not
find
.
<EOS>
"
I
delight
in
your
kitchen
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
is
the
most
charming
room
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
every
farmer
's
wife
to
come
and
look
at
it
for
a
pattern
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
you
're
pleased
to
say
so
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Pray
take
a
seat
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
relieved
a
little
by
this
compliment
and
the
captain
's
evident
good
-
humour
,
but
still
glancing
anxiously
at
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
,
she
saw
,
was
looking
at
Dinah
and
advancing
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poyser
is
not
at
home
,
is
he
?
"
said
Captain
Donnithorne
,
seating
himself
where
he
could
see
along
the
short
passage
to
the
open
dairy
-
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
he
is
n't
;
he
's
gone
to
Rosseter
to
see
Mr.
West
,
the
factor
,
about
the
wool
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
<EOS>
Father
i
'
the
barn
,
<EOS>
sir
,
if
he
'd
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
thank
you
;
I
'll
just
look
at
the
whelps
and
leave
a
message
about
them
with
your
shepherd
.
<EOS>
I
must
come
another
day
and
see
your
husband
;
I
want
to
have
a
consultation
with
him
about
horses
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
when
he
's
likely
to
be
at
liberty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
you
can
hardly
miss
him
,
except
it
's
o
'
Treddles'on
market
-
day
 
<EOS>
that
's
of
a
Friday
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
For
if
he
's
anywhere
on
the
farm
we
can
send
for
him
in
a
minute
.
<EOS>
If
we
'd
got
rid
o
'
<EOS>
the
Scantlands
,
we
should
have
no
outlying
fields
;
and
I
should
be
glad
of
it
,
for
if
ever
anything
happens
<EOS>
,
he
's
sure
to
be
gone
to
the
Scantlands
.
<EOS>
Things
allays
happen
so
contrairy
,
if
they
've
a
chance
;
and
it
's
an
unnat'ral
thing
to
have
<EOS>
one
bit
o
'
<EOS>
your
farm
in
one
county
and
all
the
rest
in
another
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
the
Scantlands
would
go
much
better
with
Choyce
's
farm
,
especially
as
he
wants
dairyland
<EOS>
and
you
've
got
plenty
.
<EOS>
I
think
yours
is
the
prettiest
farm
on
the
estate
,
though
;
and
do
you
know
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
if
I
were
going
to
marry
and
settle
,
I
should
be
tempted
to
turn
you
out
,
and
do
up
this
fine
old
house
,
and
turn
farmer
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
rather
alarmed
,
"
you
would
n't
like
it
at
all
.
<EOS>
As
for
farming
,
it
's
putting
money
into
your
pocket
wi
'
your
right
hand
and
fetching
it
out
wi
'
your
left
.
<EOS>
As
fur
as
I
can
see
,
it
's
raising
victual
for
other
folks
and
just
getting
a
mouthful
for
yourself
and
your
children
as
you
go
along
.
<EOS>
Not
as
you
'd
be
like
a
poor
man
as
wants
to
get
his
bread
 
<EOS>
you
could
afford
to
lose
as
much
money
as
you
liked
<EOS>
i
'
farming
 
<EOS>
but
it
's
poor
fun
losing
money
,
I
should
think
,
<EOS>
though
I
understan
'
it
's
what
the
great
folks
<EOS>
i
'
London
play
at
more
than
anything
.
<EOS>
For
my
husband
heard
at
market
as
Lord
Dacey
's
eldest
son
had
lost
thousands
upo
'
thousands
to
the
Prince
o
'
Wales
,
and
they
said
my
lady
was
going
to
pawn
her
jewels
to
pay
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
you
know
more
about
that
than
I
do
,
sir
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
for
farming
,
sir
,
I
canna
think
as
you
'd
like
it
;
and
this
house
 
<EOS>
the
draughts
in
it
are
enough
to
cut
you
through
,
and
it
's
my
opinion
<EOS>
the
floors
upstairs
are
very
rotten
,
and
the
rats
<EOS>
i
'
the
cellar
are
beyond
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
a
terrible
picture
,
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
should
be
doing
you
a
service
to
turn
you
out
of
such
a
place
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
chance
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
likely
to
settle
for
the
next
twenty
years
,
till
I
'm
a
stout
gentleman
of
forty
;
and
my
grandfather
would
never
consent
to
part
with
such
good
tenants
as
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
if
he
thinks
so
well
o
'
Mr.
Poyser
for
a
tenant
I
wish
you
could
put
in
a
word
for
him
to
allow
us
some
new
gates
for
the
Five
closes
,
for
my
husband
's
been
asking
and
asking
till
he
's
tired
,
and
to
think
o
'
what
he
's
done
for
the
farm
,
and
's
never
had
a
penny
allowed
him
,
be
the
times
bad
or
good
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
've
said
to
my
husband
often
and
often
,
I
'm
sure
if
the
captain
had
anything
to
do
with
it
,
it
would
n't
be
so
.
<EOS>
Not
as
I
wish
to
speak
disrespectful
o
'
<EOS>
them
as
have
got
the
power
<EOS>
i
'
their
hands
,
<EOS>
but
it
's
more
than
flesh
and
blood
'
ull
bear
sometimes
,
to
be
toiling
and
striving
,
and
up
early
and
down
late
,
and
hardly
sleeping
a
wink
when
you
lie
down
for
thinking
as
the
cheese
may
swell
,
or
the
cows
may
slip
their
calf
,
or
the
wheat
may
grow
green
again
<EOS>
i
'
the
sheaf
 
<EOS>
and
after
all
,
at
th
'
end
o
'
the
year
,
it
's
like
as
if
you
'd
been
cooking
a
feast
and
had
got
the
smell
of
it
for
your
pains
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
once
launched
into
conversation
,
always
sailed
along
without
any
check
from
her
preliminary
awe
of
the
gentry
.
<EOS>
The
confidence
she
felt
in
her
own
powers
of
exposition
was
a
motive
force
that
overcame
all
resistance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
I
should
only
do
harm
instead
of
good
,
if
I
were
to
speak
about
the
gates
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
said
the
captain
,
"
though
I
assure
you
there
's
no
man
on
the
estate
<EOS>
I
would
sooner
say
a
word
for
than
your
husband
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
farm
is
in
better
order
than
any
other
within
ten
miles
of
us
;
and
as
for
the
kitchen
,
"
he
added
,
smiling
,
"
I
do
n't
believe
there
's
one
in
the
kingdom
to
beat
it
.
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
I
've
never
seen
your
dairy
:
I
must
see
your
dairy
,
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
it
's
not
fit
for
you
to
go
in
,
for
Hetty
's
in
the
middle
o
'
making
the
butter
,
for
the
churning
was
thrown
late
,
and
I
'm
quite
ashamed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
Mrs.
Poyser
said
blushing
,
and
believing
that
the
captain
was
really
interested
in
her
milk
-
pans
,
and
would
adjust
his
opinion
of
her
to
the
appearance
of
her
dairy
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
've
no
doubt
it
's
in
capital
order
.
<EOS>
Take
me
in
,
"
said
the
captain
,
himself
leading
the
way
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
followed
.
    
<EOS>
The
Dairy
  
<EOS>
THE
dairy
was
certainly
worth
looking
at
:
it
was
a
scene
to
sicken
for
with
a
sort
of
calenture
in
hot
and
dusty
streets
 
<EOS>
such
coolness
,
such
purity
,
such
fresh
fragrance
of
new
-
pressed
cheese
,
of
firm
butter
,
of
wooden
vessels
perpetually
bathed
in
pure
water
;
such
soft
colouring
of
red
earthenware
and
creamy
surfaces
,
brown
wood
and
polished
tin
,
grey
limestone
and
rich
orange
-
red
rust
on
the
iron
weights
and
hooks
and
hinges
.
<EOS>
But
one
gets
only
a
confused
notion
of
these
details
when
they
surround
a
distractingly
pretty
girl
of
seventeen
,
standing
on
little
pattens
and
rounding
her
dimpled
arm
to
lift
a
pound
of
butter
out
of
the
scale
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
blushed
a
deep
rose
-
colour
when
Captain
Donnithorne
entered
the
dairy
and
spoke
to
her
;
but
it
was
not
at
all
a
distressed
blush
,
for
it
was
inwreathed
with
smiles
and
dimples
,
and
with
sparkles
from
under
long
,
curled
,
dark
eyelashes
;
and
while
her
aunt
was
discoursing
to
him
about
the
limited
amount
of
milk
that
was
to
be
spared
for
butter
and
cheese
so
long
as
the
calves
were
not
all
weaned
,
and
a
large
quantity
but
inferior
quality
of
milk
yielded
by
the
shorthorn
,
which
had
been
bought
on
experiment
,
together
with
other
matters
which
must
be
interesting
to
a
young
gentleman
who
would
one
day
be
a
landlord
,
Hetty
tossed
and
patted
her
pound
of
butter
with
quite
a
self
-
possessed
,
coquettish
air
,
slyly
conscious
that
no
turn
of
her
head
was
lost
.
  
<EOS>
There
are
various
orders
of
beauty
,
causing
men
to
make
fools
of
themselves
in
various
styles
,
from
the
desperate
to
the
sheepish
;
but
there
is
one
order
of
beauty
which
seems
made
to
turn
the
heads
not
only
of
men
,
but
of
all
intelligent
mammals
,
even
of
women
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
beauty
like
that
of
kittens
,
or
very
small
<EOS>
downy
ducks
making
gentle
rippling
noises
with
their
soft
bills
,
or
babies
just
beginning
to
toddle
and
to
engage
in
conscious
mischief
 
a
beauty
with
which
you
can
never
be
angry
,
but
that
you
feel
ready
to
crush
for
inability
to
comprehend
the
state
of
mind
into
which
it
throws
you
.
<EOS>
Hetty
Sorrel
's
was
that
sort
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
aunt
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
professed
to
despise
all
personal
attractions
and
intended
to
be
the
severest
of
mentors
,
continually
gazed
at
Hetty
's
charms
by
the
sly
,
fascinated
in
spite
of
herself
;
and
after
administering
such
a
scolding
as
naturally
flowed
from
her
anxiety
to
do
well
by
her
husband
's
niece
 
who
had
no
mother
of
her
own
to
scold
her
,
poor
thing
!
 
<EOS>
she
would
often
confess
to
her
husband
,
when
they
were
safe
out
of
hearing
,
that
she
firmly
believed
,
"
the
naughtier
the
little
huzzy
behaved
,
the
prettier
she
looked
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
of
little
use
for
me
to
tell
you
that
Hetty
's
cheek
was
like
a
rose
-
petal
,
<EOS>
that
dimples
played
about
her
pouting
lips
,
that
her
large
dark
eyes
hid
a
soft
roguishness
under
their
long
lashes
,
and
that
her
curly
hair
,
though
all
pushed
back
under
her
round
cap
while
she
was
at
work
,
stole
back
in
dark
delicate
rings
on
her
forehead
,
and
about
her
white
shell
-
like
ears
;
it
is
of
little
use
for
me
to
say
how
lovely
was
the
contour
of
her
pink
-
and
-
white
neckerchief
<EOS>
,
tucked
into
her
low
plum
-
coloured
stuff
bodice
,
or
how
the
linen
butter
-
making
apron
,
with
its
bib
,
seemed
a
thing
to
be
imitated
in
silk
by
duchesses
,
since
it
fell
in
such
charming
lines
,
or
how
her
brown
stockings
and
thick
-
soled
buckled
shoes
lost
all
that
clumsiness
which
they
must
certainly
have
had
when
empty
of
her
foot
and
ankle
 
of
little
use
,
unless
you
have
seen
a
woman
who
affected
you
as
Hetty
affected
her
beholders
,
for
otherwise
,
though
you
might
conjure
up
the
image
of
a
lovely
woman
,
she
would
not
in
the
least
resemble
that
distracting
kittenlike
maiden
.
<EOS>
I
might
mention
all
the
divine
charms
of
a
bright
spring
day
,
but
if
you
had
never
in
your
life
utterly
forgotten
yourself
in
straining
your
eyes
after
the
mounting
lark
,
or
in
wandering
through
the
still
lanes
when
the
fresh
-
opened
blossoms
fill
them
with
a
sacred
silent
beauty
like
that
of
fretted
aisles
,
where
would
be
the
use
of
my
descriptive
catalogue
?
<EOS>
I
could
never
make
you
know
what
I
meant
by
a
bright
spring
day
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
was
a
spring
-
tide
beauty
;
it
was
the
beauty
of
young
frisking
things
,
round
-
limbed
,
gambolling
,
circumventing
you
by
a
false
air
of
innocence
 
the
innocence
of
a
young
star
-
browed
calf
,
for
example
,
that
,
being
inclined
for
a
promenade
out
of
bounds
,
leads
you
a
severe
steeplechase
over
hedge
and
ditch
,
and
only
comes
to
a
stand
in
the
middle
of
a
bog
.
  
<EOS>
And
they
are
the
prettiest
attitudes
and
movements
into
which
a
pretty
girl
is
thrown
in
making
up
butter
 
tossing
movements
that
give
a
charming
curve
to
the
arm
,
and
a
sideward
inclination
of
the
round
white
neck
;
<EOS>
little
patting
and
rolling
movements
with
the
palm
of
the
hand
,
and
nice
adaptations
and
finishings
which
can
not
at
all
be
effected
without
a
great
play
of
the
pouting
mouth
and
the
dark
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
butter
itself
seems
to
communicate
a
fresh
charm
 
<EOS>
it
is
so
pure
,
so
sweet
-
scented
;
it
is
turned
off
the
mould
with
such
a
beautiful
firm
surface
,
like
marble
in
a
pale
yellow
light
!
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Hetty
was
particularly
clever
at
making
up
the
butter
;
it
was
the
one
performance
of
hers
that
her
aunt
allowed
to
pass
without
severe
criticism
;
so
she
handled
it
with
all
the
grace
that
belongs
to
mastery
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
be
ready
for
a
great
holiday
on
the
thirtieth
of
July
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
said
Captain
Donnithorne
,
when
he
had
sufficiently
admired
the
dairy
and
given
several
improvised
opinions
on
Swede
turnips
and
shorthorns
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
is
to
happen
then
,
and
I
shall
expect
you
to
be
one
of
the
guests
who
come
earliest
and
leave
latest
.
<EOS>
Will
you
promise
me
your
hand
for
two
dances
,
Miss
Hetty
?
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
get
your
promise
now
,
<EOS>
I
know
I
shall
hardly
have
a
chance
,
for
all
the
smart
young
farmers
will
take
care
to
secure
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
smiled
and
blushed
,
but
before
she
could
answer
,
Mrs.
Poyser
interposed
,
scandalized
at
the
mere
suggestion
that
the
young
squire
could
be
excluded
by
any
meaner
partners
.
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
you
are
very
kind
to
take
that
notice
of
her
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
,
whenever
you
're
pleased
to
dance
with
her
,
she
'll
be
proud
and
thankful
,
if
she
stood
still
all
the
rest
<EOS>
o
'
th
'
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
no
,
that
would
be
too
cruel
to
all
the
other
young
fellows
who
can
dance
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
promise
me
two
dances
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
the
captain
continued
,
determined
to
make
Hetty
look
at
him
and
speak
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
dropped
the
prettiest
little
curtsy
,
and
stole
a
half
-
shy
,
half
-
coquettish
glance
at
him
as
she
said
,
"
Yes
,
thank
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
must
bring
all
your
children
,
you
know
,
Mrs.
Poyser
;
your
little
Totty
,
as
well
as
the
boys
.
<EOS>
I
want
all
the
youngest
children
on
the
estate
to
be
there
 
all
those
who
will
be
fine
young
men
and
women
when
I
'm
a
bald
old
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
dear
,
sir
,
that
'
ull
be
a
long
time
first
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
quite
overcome
at
the
young
squire
's
speaking
so
lightly
of
himself
,
and
thinking
how
her
husband
would
be
interested
in
hearing
her
recount
this
remarkable
specimen
of
high
-
born
humour
.
<EOS>
The
captain
was
thought
to
be
"
very
full
of
his
jokes
,
"
and
was
a
great
favourite
throughout
the
estate
on
account
of
his
free
manners
.
<EOS>
Every
tenant
was
quite
sure
things
would
be
different
when
the
reins
got
into
his
hands
 
there
was
to
be
a
millennial
abundance
of
new
gates
,
allowances
of
lime
,
and
returns
of
ten
per
cent
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
where
is
Totty
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
IS
the
little
un
,
Hetty
?
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
She
came
in
here
not
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
She
went
into
the
brewhouse
to
Nancy
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
proud
mother
,
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
show
her
Totty
,
passed
at
once
into
the
back
kitchen
,
in
search
of
her
,
not
,
however
,
without
misgivings
lest
something
should
have
happened
to
render
her
person
and
attire
unfit
for
presentation
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
you
carry
the
butter
to
market
when
you
've
made
it
?
"
said
the
Captain
to
Hetty
,
meanwhile
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
sir
;
not
when
it
's
so
heavy
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
strong
enough
to
carry
it
.
<EOS>
Alick
takes
it
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
'm
sure
your
pretty
arms
were
never
meant
for
such
heavy
weights
.
<EOS>
But
you
go
out
a
walk
sometimes
these
pleasant
evenings
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
walk
in
the
Chase
sometimes
,
now
it
's
so
green
and
pleasant
?
<EOS>
I
hardly
ever
see
you
anywhere
except
at
home
and
at
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aunt
does
n't
like
me
to
go
a
-
walking
only
when
I
'm
going
somewhere
,
"
said
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
go
through
the
Chase
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
do
n't
you
ever
go
to
see
Mrs.
Best
,
the
housekeeper
?
<EOS>
I
think
I
saw
you
once
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
Mrs.
Best
,
it
's
Mrs.
Pomfret
,
the
lady
's
maid
,
as
I
go
to
see
.
<EOS>
She
's
teaching
me
tent
-
stitch
and
the
lace
-
mending
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
tea
with
her
to
-
morrow
afternoon
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
reason
why
there
had
been
space
for
this
tete
-
a
-
tete
can
only
be
known
by
looking
into
the
back
kitchen
,
where
Totty
had
been
discovered
rubbing
a
stray
blue
-
bag
against
her
nose
,
and
in
the
same
moment
allowing
some
liberal
indigo
drops
to
fall
on
her
afternoon
pinafore
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
appeared
holding
her
mother
's
hand
 
<EOS>
the
end
of
her
round
nose
<EOS>
rather
shiny
from
a
recent
and
hurried
application
of
soap
and
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
she
is
!
"
said
the
captain
,
lifting
her
up
and
setting
her
on
the
low
stone
shelf
.
<EOS>
"
Here
's
Totty
!
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
what
's
her
other
name
?
<EOS>
She
was
n't
christened
Totty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
we
call
her
sadly
out
of
her
name
.
<EOS>
Charlotte
's
her
christened
name
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
name
<EOS>
i
'
Mr.
Poyser
's
family
:
his
grandmother
was
named
Charlotte
.
<EOS>
But
we
began
with
calling
her
Lotty
,
and
now
it
's
got
to
Totty
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
it
's
more
like
a
name
for
a
dog
than
a
Christian
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Totty
's
a
capital
name
.
<EOS>
Why
,
she
looks
like
a
Totty
.
<EOS>
Has
she
got
a
pocket
on
?
"
said
the
captain
,
feeling
in
his
own
waistcoat
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
Totty
immediately
with
great
gravity
lifted
up
her
frock
,
and
showed
a
tiny
pink
pocket
at
present
in
a
state
of
collapse
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
dot
notin
'
in
it
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
looked
down
at
it
very
earnestly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
<EOS>
What
a
pity
!
<EOS>
Such
a
pretty
pocket
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
I
've
got
some
things
in
mine
that
will
make
a
pretty
jingle
in
it
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
declare
I
've
got
five
little
round
silver
things
,
and
hear
what
a
pretty
noise
they
make
in
Totty
's
pink
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Here
he
shook
the
pocket
with
the
five
sixpences
in
it
,
and
Totty
showed
her
teeth
and
wrinkled
her
nose
in
great
glee
;
but
,
divining
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
got
by
staying
,
she
jumped
off
the
shelf
and
ran
away
to
jingle
her
pocket
in
the
hearing
of
Nancy
,
while
her
mother
called
after
her
,
"
Oh
for
shame
,
you
naughty
gell
!
<EOS>
Not
to
thank
the
captain
for
what
he
's
given
you
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
<EOS>
,
sir
,
it
's
very
kind
of
you
;
but
she
's
spoiled
shameful
;
her
father
wo
n't
have
her
said
nay
in
anything
,
and
there
's
no
managing
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
being
the
youngest
,
and
th
'
only
gell
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
she
's
a
funny
little
fatty
;
I
would
n't
have
her
different
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
going
now
,
for
I
suppose
the
rector
is
waiting
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
a
"
good
-
bye
,
"
a
bright
glance
,
and
a
bow
to
Hetty
Arthur
left
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
mistaken
in
imagining
himself
waited
for
.
<EOS>
The
rector
had
been
so
much
interested
in
his
conversation
with
Dinah
that
he
would
not
have
chosen
to
close
it
earlier
;
and
you
shall
hear
now
what
they
had
been
saying
to
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
A
Vocation
  
DINAH
,
who
had
risen
when
the
gentlemen
came
in
,
but
still
kept
hold
of
the
sheet
she
was
mending
,
curtsied
respectfully
when
she
saw
Mr.
Irwine
looking
at
her
and
advancing
towards
her
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
yet
spoken
to
her
,
or
stood
face
to
face
with
her
,
and
her
first
thought
,
as
her
eyes
met
his
,
was
,
"
What
a
well
-
favoured
countenance
!
<EOS>
Oh
that
the
good
seed
might
fall
on
that
soil
,
for
it
would
surely
flourish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
agreeable
impression
must
have
been
mutual
,
for
Mr.
Irwine
bowed
to
her
with
a
benignant
deference
,
which
would
have
been
equally
in
place
if
she
had
been
the
most
dignified
lady
of
his
acquaintance
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
only
a
visitor
in
this
neighbourhood
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
were
his
first
words
,
as
he
seated
himself
opposite
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
come
from
Snowfield
,
in
Stonyshire
.
<EOS>
But
my
aunt
was
very
kind
,
wanting
me
to
have
rest
from
my
work
there
,
because
I
'd
been
ill
,
and
she
invited
me
to
come
and
stay
with
her
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
remember
Snowfield
very
well
;
I
once
had
occasion
to
go
there
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
dreary
bleak
place
.
<EOS>
They
were
building
a
cotton
-
mill
there
;
but
that
's
many
years
ago
now
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
place
is
a
good
deal
changed
by
the
employment
that
mill
must
have
brought
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
IS
changed
so
far
as
the
mill
has
brought
people
there
,
who
get
a
livelihood
for
themselves
by
working
in
it
,
and
make
it
better
for
the
tradesfolks
.
<EOS>
I
work
in
it
myself
,
and
have
reason
to
be
grateful
,
for
thereby
I
have
enough
and
to
spare
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
still
a
bleak
place
,
as
you
say
,
sir
 
very
different
from
this
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
relations
living
there
,
probably
,
so
that
you
are
attached
to
the
place
as
your
home
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
an
aunt
there
once
;
she
brought
me
up
,
for
I
was
an
orphan
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
taken
away
seven
years
ago
,
and
I
have
<EOS>
no
other
kindred
that
I
know
of
,
besides
my
Aunt
Poyser
,
who
is
very
good
to
me
,
and
would
have
me
come
and
live
in
this
country
,
which
to
be
sure
<EOS>
is
a
good
land
,
wherein
they
eat
bread
without
scarceness
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
free
to
leave
Snowfield
,
where
I
was
first
planted
,
and
have
grown
deep
into
it
,
like
the
small
grass
on
the
hill
-
top
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
daresay
you
have
many
religious
friends
and
companions
there
;
you
are
a
Methodist
 
a
Wesleyan
,
I
think
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
aunt
at
Snowfield
belonged
to
the
Society
,
and
I
have
cause
to
be
thankful
for
the
privileges
I
have
had
thereby
from
my
earliest
childhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
have
you
been
long
in
the
habit
of
preaching
?
<EOS>
For
I
understand
you
preached
at
Hayslope
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
first
took
to
the
work
four
years
since
,
when
I
was
twenty
-
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
Society
sanctions
women
's
preaching
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
It
does
n't
forbid
them
,
sir
,
when
they
've
a
clear
call
to
the
work
,
and
when
their
ministry
is
owned
by
the
conversion
of
sinners
and
the
strengthening
of
God
's
people
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Fletcher
,
as
you
may
have
heard
about
,
was
the
first
woman
to
preach
in
the
Society
,
I
believe
,
before
she
was
married
,
when
she
was
Miss
Bosanquet
;
and
Mr.
Wesley
approved
of
her
undertaking
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
great
gift
,
and
there
are
many
others
now
living
who
are
precious
fellow
-
helpers
in
the
work
of
the
ministry
.
<EOS>
I
understand
there
's
been
voices
raised
against
it
in
the
Society
of
late
,
but
I
can
not
but
think
their
counsel
will
come
to
nought
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
for
men
to
make
channels
for
God
's
Spirit
,
as
they
make
channels
for
the
watercourses
,
and
say
,
"
Flow
here
,
but
flow
not
there
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
do
n't
you
find
some
danger
among
your
people
 
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
it
is
so
with
you
,
far
from
it
 
but
do
n't
you
find
sometimes
that
both
men
and
women
fancy
themselves
channels
for
God
's
Spirit
,
and
are
quite
mistaken
,
so
that
they
set
about
a
work
for
which
they
are
unfit
and
bring
holy
things
into
contempt
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Doubtless
<EOS>
it
is
so
sometimes
;
for
there
have
been
evil
-
doers
among
us
who
have
sought
to
deceive
the
brethren
,
and
some
there
are
who
deceive
their
own
selves
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
not
without
discipline
and
correction
to
put
a
check
upon
these
things
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
very
strict
order
kept
among
us
,
and
the
brethren
and
sisters
watch
for
each
other
's
souls
as
they
that
must
give
account
.
<EOS>
They
do
n't
go
every
one
his
own
way
and
say
,
"
Am
I
my
brother
's
keeper
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
tell
me
 
if
I
may
ask
,
and
I
am
really
interested
in
knowing
it
 
how
you
first
came
to
think
of
preaching
?
"
  
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
did
n't
think
of
it
at
all
 
<EOS>
I
'd
been
used
from
the
time
I
was
sixteen
to
talk
to
the
little
children
,
and
teach
them
,
and
sometimes
I
had
had
my
heart
enlarged
to
speak
in
class
,
and
was
much
drawn
out
in
prayer
with
the
sick
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
felt
no
call
to
preach
,
for
when
I
'm
not
greatly
wrought
upon
,
I
'm
too
much
given
to
sit
still
and
keep
by
myself
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
I
could
sit
silent
all
day
long
with
the
thought
of
God
overflowing
my
soul
 
<EOS>
as
the
pebbles
lie
bathed
in
the
Willow
Brook
.
<EOS>
For
thoughts
are
so
great
 
<EOS>
are
n't
they
,
sir
?
<EOS>
They
seem
to
lie
upon
us
like
a
deep
flood
;
and
it
's
my
besetment
to
forget
where
I
am
and
everything
about
me
,
and
lose
myself
in
thoughts
that
I
could
give
no
account
of
,
for
I
could
neither
make
a
beginning
nor
ending
of
them
in
words
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
way
as
long
as
I
can
remember
;
but
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
speech
came
to
me
without
any
will
of
my
own
,
and
words
were
given
to
me
that
came
out
as
the
tears
come
,
because
our
hearts
are
full
and
we
ca
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
And
those
were
always
times
of
great
blessing
,
though
I
had
never
thought
it
could
be
so
with
me
before
a
congregation
of
people
.
<EOS>
But
,
sir
,
we
are
led
on
,
like
the
little
children
,
by
a
way
that
we
know
not
.
<EOS>
I
was
called
to
preach
quite
suddenly
,
and
since
then
I
have
never
been
left
in
doubt
about
the
work
that
was
laid
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
tell
me
the
circumstances
 
just
how
it
was
,
the
very
day
you
began
to
preach
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
one
Sunday
I
walked
with
brother
Marlowe
,
who
was
an
aged
man
,
one
of
the
local
preachers
,
all
the
way
to
Hetton
-
Deeps
 
<EOS>
that
's
a
village
where
the
people
get
their
living
by
working
in
the
lead
-
mines
,
and
where
there
's
no
church
nor
preacher
,
but
they
live
like
sheep
without
a
shepherd
.
<EOS>
It
's
better
than
twelve
miles
from
Snowfield
,
so
we
set
out
early
in
the
morning
,
for
it
was
summertime
;
and
I
had
a
wonderful
sense
of
the
Divine
love
as
we
walked
over
the
hills
,
where
there
's
no
trees
,
you
know
,
sir
,
as
there
is
here
,
to
make
the
sky
look
smaller
,
but
<EOS>
you
see
the
heavens
stretched
out
like
a
tent
,
and
you
feel
the
everlasting
arms
around
you
.
<EOS>
But
before
we
got
to
Hetton
,
brother
Marlowe
was
seized
with
a
dizziness
that
made
him
afraid
of
falling
,
for
he
overworked
himself
sadly
,
at
his
years
,
in
watching
and
praying
,
and
walking
so
many
miles
to
speak
the
Word
,
as
well
as
carrying
on
his
trade
of
linen
-
weaving
.
<EOS>
And
when
we
got
to
the
village
,
the
people
were
expecting
him
,
for
he
'd
appointed
the
time
and
the
place
when
he
was
there
before
,
and
such
of
them
as
cared
to
hear
the
Word
of
Life
were
assembled
on
a
spot
where
the
cottages
was
thickest
,
so
as
others
might
be
drawn
to
come
.
<EOS>
But
he
felt
as
he
could
n't
stand
up
to
preach
,
and
he
was
forced
to
lie
down
in
the
first
of
the
cottages
we
came
to
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
to
tell
the
people
,
thinking
we
'd
go
into
one
of
the
houses
,
and
I
would
read
and
pray
with
them
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
passed
along
by
the
cottages
and
saw
the
aged
and
trembling
women
at
the
doors
,
and
the
hard
looks
of
the
men
,
who
seemed
to
have
their
eyes
no
more
filled
with
the
sight
of
the
Sabbath
morning
than
if
they
had
been
dumb
oxen
that
never
looked
up
to
the
sky
,
I
felt
a
great
movement
in
my
soul
,
and
I
trembled
as
if
I
was
shaken
by
a
strong
spirit
entering
into
my
weak
body
.
<EOS>
And
I
went
to
where
the
little
flock
of
people
was
gathered
together
,
and
stepped
on
the
low
wall
that
was
built
against
the
green
hillside
,
and
I
spoke
the
words
that
were
given
to
me
abundantly
.
<EOS>
And
they
all
came
round
me
out
of
all
the
cottages
,
and
many
wept
over
their
sins
,
and
have
since
been
joined
to
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
beginning
of
my
preaching
,
sir
,
and
I
've
preached
ever
since
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
had
let
her
work
fall
during
this
narrative
,
which
she
uttered
in
her
usual
simple
way
,
but
with
that
sincere
articulate
,
thrilling
treble
by
which
she
always
mastered
her
audience
.
<EOS>
She
stooped
now
to
gather
up
her
sewing
,
and
then
went
on
with
it
as
before
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
was
deeply
interested
.
<EOS>
He
said
to
himself
,
"
He
must
be
a
miserable
prig
who
would
act
the
pedagogue
here
:
one
might
as
well
go
and
lecture
the
trees
for
growing
in
their
own
shape
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
never
feel
any
embarrassment
from
the
sense
of
your
youth
 
that
you
are
a
lovely
young
woman
on
whom
men
's
eyes
are
fixed
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
aloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
've
no
room
for
such
feelings
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
the
people
ever
take
notice
about
that
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
sir
,
when
God
makes
His
presence
felt
through
us
,
we
are
like
the
burning
bush
:
<EOS>
Moses
never
took
any
heed
what
sort
of
bush
<EOS>
it
was
 
<EOS>
he
only
saw
the
brightness
of
the
Lord
.
<EOS>
I
've
preached
to
as
rough
ignorant
people
as
can
be
in
the
villages
about
Snowfield
 
men
that
looked
very
hard
and
wild
 
<EOS>
but
they
never
said
an
uncivil
word
to
me
,
and
often
thanked
me
kindly
as
they
made
way
for
me
to
pass
through
the
midst
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
THAT
I
can
believe
 
that
I
can
well
believe
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
what
did
you
think
of
your
hearers
last
night
,
now
?
<EOS>
Did
you
find
them
quiet
and
attentive
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Very
quiet
,
sir
,
but
I
saw
no
signs
of
any
great
work
upon
them
,
except
in
a
young
girl
named
Bessy
Cranage
,
towards
whom
my
heart
yearned
greatly
,
when
my
eyes
first
fell
on
her
blooming
youth
,
given
up
to
folly
and
vanity
.
<EOS>
I
had
some
private
talk
and
prayer
with
her
afterwards
,
and
I
trust
her
heart
is
touched
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
noticed
that
in
these
villages
where
the
people
lead
a
quiet
life
among
the
green
pastures
and
the
still
waters
,
tilling
the
ground
and
tending
the
cattle
,
there
's
a
strange
deadness
to
the
Word
,
as
different
as
can
be
from
the
great
towns
,
like
Leeds
,
where
I
once
went
to
visit
a
holy
woman
who
preaches
there
.
<EOS>
It
's
wonderful
how
rich
is
the
harvest
of
souls
up
those
high
-
walled
streets
,
where
you
seemed
to
walk
as
in
a
prison
-
yard
,
and
the
ear
is
deafened
with
the
sounds
of
worldly
toil
.
<EOS>
I
think
maybe
it
is
because
the
promise
is
sweeter
when
this
life
is
so
dark
and
weary
,
and
the
soul
gets
more
hungry
when
the
body
is
ill
at
ease
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
our
farm
-
labourers
are
not
easily
roused
.
<EOS>
They
take
life
almost
as
slowly
as
the
sheep
and
cows
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
some
intelligent
workmen
about
here
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
you
know
the
Bedes
;
Seth
Bede
,
by
the
by
,
is
a
Methodist
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
Seth
well
,
and
his
brother
Adam
a
little
.
<EOS>
Seth
is
a
gracious
young
man
 
sincere
and
without
offence
;
and
Adam
is
like
the
patriarch
Joseph
,
for
his
great
skill
and
knowledge
and
the
kindness
he
shows
to
his
brother
and
his
parents
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
do
n't
know
the
trouble
that
has
just
happened
to
them
?
<EOS>
Their
father
,
Matthias
Bede
,
was
drowned
in
the
Willow
Brook
last
night
,
not
far
from
his
own
door
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
now
to
see
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
their
poor
aged
mother
!
"
said
Dinah
,
dropping
her
hands
and
looking
before
her
with
pitying
eyes
,
as
if
she
saw
the
object
of
her
sympathy
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
mourn
heavily
,
for
Seth
has
told
me
she
's
of
an
anxious
,
troubled
heart
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
and
see
if
I
can
give
her
any
help
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
she
rose
and
was
beginning
to
fold
up
her
work
,
Captain
Donnithorne
,
having
exhausted
all
plausible
pretexts
for
remaining
among
the
milk
-
pans
,
came
out
of
the
dairy
,
followed
by
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
now
rose
also
,
and
,
advancing
towards
Dinah
,
held
out
his
hand
,
and
said
,
"
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
I
hear
you
are
going
away
soon
;
but
this
will
not
be
the
last
visit
you
will
pay
your
aunt
 
<EOS>
so
we
shall
meet
again
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
His
cordiality
towards
Dinah
set
all
Mrs.
Poyser
's
anxieties
at
rest
,
and
her
face
was
brighter
than
usual
,
as
she
said
,
"
I
've
never
asked
after
Mrs.
Irwine
and
the
Miss
Irwines
,
sir
<EOS>
;
I
hope
they
're
as
well
as
usual
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
thank
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
except
that
Miss
Anne
has
one
of
her
bad
headaches
to

day

By
the
by
,
we
all
liked
that
nice
cream
-
cheese
you
sent
us
 
my
mother
especially
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
very
glad
,
indeed
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
is
but
<EOS>
seldom
I
make
one
,
but
I
remembered
Mrs.
Irwine
was
fond
of
'em
.
<EOS>
Please
to
give
my
duty
to
her
,
and
to
Miss
Kate
and
Miss
Anne
.
<EOS>
They
've
never
been
to
look
at
my
poultry
this
long
while
,
and
I
've
got
some
beautiful
speckled
chickens
,
black
and
white
,
as
Miss
Kate
might
like
to
have
some
of
amongst
hers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'll
tell
her
;
she
must
come
and
see
them
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
"
said
the
rector
,
mounting
his
horse
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
ride
slowly
on
,
Irwine
,
"
said
Captain
Donnithorne
,
mounting
also
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
overtake
you
in
three
minutes
.
<EOS>
I
'm
only
going
to
speak
to
the
shepherd
about
the
whelps
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Mrs.
Poyser
;
tell
your
husband
I
shall
come
and
have
a
long
talk
with
him
soon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
curtsied
duly
,
and
watched
the
two
horses
until
they
had
disappeared
from
the
yard
,
amidst
great
excitement
on
the
part
of
the
pigs
and
the
poultry
,
and
under
the
furious
indignation
of
the
bull
-
dog
,
who
performed
a
Pyrrhic
dance
,
that
every
moment
seemed
to
threaten
the
breaking
of
his
chain
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
delighted
in
this
noisy
exit
;
it
was
a
fresh
assurance
to
her
that
the
farm
-
yard
was
well
guarded
,
and
that
no
loiterers
could
enter
unobserved
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
gate
had
closed
behind
the
captain
that
she
turned
into
the
kitchen
again
,
where
Dinah
stood
with
her
bonnet
in
her
hand
,
waiting
to
speak
to
her
aunt
,
before
she
set
out
for
Lisbeth
Bede
's
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
however
,
though
she
noticed
the
bonnet
,
deferred
remarking
on
it
until
she
had
disburdened
herself
of
her
surprise
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
behaviour
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr.
Irwine
was
n't
angry
,
then
?
<EOS>
What
did
he
say
to
you
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
he
scold
you
for
preaching
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
was
not
at
all
angry
;
he
was
very
friendly
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
quite
drawn
out
to
speak
to
him
;
I
hardly
know
how
,
for
I
had
always
thought
of
him
as
a
worldly
Sadducee
.
<EOS>
But
his
countenance
is
as
pleasant
as
the
morning
sunshine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pleasant
!
<EOS>
And
what
else
did
y
'
expect
to
find
him
but
pleasant
?
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
impatiently
,
resuming
her
knitting
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
think
his
countenance
is
pleasant
indeed
!
<EOS>
And
him
a
gentleman
born
,
and
's
got
a
mother
like
a
picter
.
<EOS>
You
may
go
the
country
round
and
not
find
such
another
woman
turned
sixty
-
six
.
<EOS>
It
's
summat
-
like
to
see
such
a
man
as
that
i
'
the
desk
of
a
Sunday
!
<EOS>
As
I
say
to
Poyser
,
it
's
like
looking
at
a
full
crop
o
'
wheat
,
or
a
pasture
with
a
fine
dairy
o
'
cows
in
it
;
it
makes
you
think
the
world
's
comfortable
-
like
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
such
creaturs
as
you
Methodisses
run
after
,
I
'd
as
soon
go
to
look
at
a
lot
o
'
bare
-
ribbed
runts
on
a
common
.
<EOS>
Fine
folks
they
are
to
tell
you
what
's
right
,
as
look
as
if
they
'd
never
tasted
nothing
better
than
bacon
-
sword
and
sour
-
cake
<EOS>
i
'
their
lives
.
<EOS>
But
what
did
Mr.
Irwine
say
to
you
about
that
fool
's
trick
o
'
preaching
on
the
Green
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
only
said
he
'd
heard
of
it
;
he
did
n't
seem
to
feel
any
displeasure
about
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
dear
aunt
,
do
n't
think
any
more
about
that
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
something
that
I
'm
sure
will
cause
you
sorrow
,
as
it
does
me
.
<EOS>
Thias
Bede
was
drowned
last
night
in
the
Willow
Brook
,
and
I
'm
thinking
that
the
aged
mother
will
be
greatly
in
need
of
comfort
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
can
be
of
use
to
her
,
so
I
have
fetched
my
bonnet
and
am
going
to
set
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
heart
,
dear
heart
!
<EOS>
But
you
must
have
a
cup
o
'
tea
first
,
child
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
falling
at
once
from
the
key
of
B
with
five
sharps
to
the
frank
and
genial
C.
<EOS>
"
The
kettle
's
boiling
 
<EOS>
we
'll
have
it
ready
in
a
minute
;
and
the
young
uns
'
ull
be
in
and
wanting
theirs
directly
.
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
willing
you
should
go
and
see
th
'
old
woman
,
for
you
're
one
as
is
allays
welcome
in
trouble
,
Methodist
or
no
Methodist
;
but
,
for
the
matter
o
'
<EOS>
that
,
it
's
the
flesh
and
blood
folks
are
made
on
as
makes
the
difference
.
<EOS>
Some
cheeses
are
made
o
'
skimmed
milk
and
some
o
'
new
milk
,
and
it
's
no
matter
what
you
call
'em
<EOS>
,
you
may
tell
which
is
which
by
the
look
and
the
smell
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
Thias
Bede
,
he
's
better
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
way
nor
in
 
<EOS>
God
forgi
'
me
for
saying
so
 
for
he
's
done
little
this
ten
year
but
make
trouble
for
them
as
belonged
to
him
;
and
<EOS>
I
think
it
'
ud
be
well
for
you
to
take
a
little
bottle
o
'
rum
for
th
'
old
woman
,
<EOS>
for
I
daresay
she
's
got
never
a
drop
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
nothing
to
comfort
her
inside
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
child
,
and
be
easy
,
for
you
sha
n't
stir
out
till
you
've
had
a
cup
o

tea
,
and
<EOS>
so
I
tell
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
During
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
Mrs.
Poyser
had
been
reaching
down
the
tea
-
things
from
the
shelves
,
and
was
on
her
way
towards
the
pantry
for
the
loaf
(
followed
close
by
Totty
,
who
had
made
her
appearance
on
the
rattling
of
the
tea
-
cups
)
,
when
Hetty
came
out
of
the
dairy
relieving
her
tired
arms
by
lifting
them
up
,
and
clasping
her
hands
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Molly
,
"
she
said
,
rather
languidly
,
"
just
run
out
and
get
me
a
bunch
of
dock
-
leaves
:
the
butter
's
ready
to
pack
up
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
D
'
you
hear
what
's
happened
,
Hetty
?
"
said
her
aunt
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
how
should
I
hear
anything
?
"
<EOS>
was
the
answer
,
in
a
pettish
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
as
you
'd
care
much
,
I
daresay
,
if
you
did
hear
;
for
you
're
too
feather
-
headed
to
mind
<EOS>
if
everybody
was
dead
,
so
as
you
could
stay
upstairs
a
-
dressing
yourself
for
two
hours
by
the
clock
.
<EOS>
But
anybody
besides
yourself
'
ud
mind
about
such
things
happening
to
them
as
think
a
deal
more
of
you
than
you
deserve
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
Bede
and
all
his
kin
might
be
drownded
for
what
you
'd
care
 
<EOS>
you
'd
be
perking
at
the
glass
the
next
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
Bede
 
drowned
?
"
said
Hetty
,
letting
her
arms
fall
and
looking
rather
bewildered
,
but
suspecting
that
her
aunt
was
as
usual
exaggerating
with
a
didactic
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
my
dear
,
no
,
"
said
Dinah
kindly
,
for
Mrs.
Poyser
had
passed
on
to
the
pantry
without
deigning
more
precise
information
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
Adam
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
father
,
the
old
man
,
is
drowned
.
<EOS>
He
was
drowned
last
night
in
the
Willow
Brook
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
has
just
told
me
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
dreadful
!
"
said
Hetty
,
looking
serious
,
but
not
deeply
affected
;
and
as
Molly
now
entered
with
the
dock
-
leaves
,
she
took
them
silently
and
returned
to
the
dairy
without
asking
further
questions
.
    
<EOS>
Hetty
's
World
  
WHILE
she
adjusted
the
broad
leaves
that
set
off
the
pale
fragrant
butter
as
the
primrose
is
set
off
by
its
nest
of
green
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
Hetty
was
thinking
a
great
deal
more
of
the
looks
Captain
Donnithorne
had
cast
at
her
than
of
Adam
and
his
troubles
.
<EOS>
Bright
,
admiring
glances
from
a
handsome
young
gentleman
with
white
hands
,
a
gold
chain
,
occasional
regimentals
,
and
wealth
and
grandeur
immeasurable
 
<EOS>
those
were
the
warm
rays
that
set
poor
Hetty
's
heart
vibrating
and
playing
its
little
foolish
tunes
over
and
over
again
.
<EOS>
We
do
not
hear
that
Memnon
's
statue
gave
forth
its
melody
at
all
under
the
rushing
of
the
mightiest
wind
,
or
in
response
to
any
other
influence
divine
or
human
than
certain
short
-
lived
sunbeams
of
morning
;
and
we
must
learn
to
accommodate
ourselves
to
the
discovery
that
some
of
those
cunningly
fashioned
instruments
called
human
souls
have
only
a
very
limited
range
of
music
,
and
will
not
vibrate
in
the
least
under
a
touch
that
fills
others
with
tremulous
rapture
or
quivering
agony
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
quite
used
to
the
thought
that
people
liked
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
young
Luke
Britton
of
Broxton
came
to
Hayslope
Church
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
on
purpose
that
he
might
see
her
;
and
that
he
would
have
made
much
more
decided
advances
if
her
uncle
Poyser
,
thinking
but
lightly
of
a
young
man
whose
father
's
land
was
so
foul
as
old
Luke
Britton
's
,
had
not
forbidden
her
aunt
to
encourage
him
by
any
civilities
.
<EOS>
She
was
aware
,
too
,
that
Mr.
Craig
,
the
gardener
at
the
Chase
,
was
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
her
,
and
had
lately
made
unmistakable
avowals
in
luscious
strawberries
and
hyperbolical
peas
.
<EOS>
She
knew
still
better
,
that
Adam
Bede
 
tall
,
upright
,
clever
,
brave
Adam
Bede
 
<EOS>
who
carried
such
authority
with
all
the
people
round
about
,
and
whom
her
uncle
was
always
delighted
to
see
of
an
evening
,
saying
that
"
Adam
knew
a
fine
sight
<EOS>
more
o
'
<EOS>
the
natur
o
'
things
than
those
as
thought
themselves
his
betters
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
she
knew
that
this
Adam
,
who
was
often
rather
stern
to
other
people
and
not
much
given
to
run
after
the
lasses
,
could
be
made
to
turn
pale
or
red
any
day
by
a
word
or
a
look
from
her
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
sphere
of
comparison
was
not
large
,
but
she
could
n't
help
perceiving
that
Adam
was
"
something
like
"
a
man
;
always
knew
what
to
say
about
things
,
could
tell
her
uncle
how
to
prop
the
hovel
,
and
had
mended
the
churn
in
no
time
;
knew
,
with
only
looking
at
it
,
the
value
of
the
chestnut
-
tree
that
was
blown
down
,
and
why
the
damp
came
in
the
walls
,
and
what
they
must
do
to
stop
the
rats
;
and
wrote
a
beautiful
hand
that
you
could
read
off
,
and
could
do
figures
in
his
head
 
a
degree
of
accomplishment
totally
unknown
among
the
richest
farmers
of
that
countryside
.
<EOS>
Not
at
all
like
that
slouching
Luke
Britton
,
who
,
when
she
once
walked
with
him
all
the
way
from
Broxton
to
Hayslope
,
had
only
broken
silence
to
remark
that
the
grey
goose
had
begun
to
lay
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
Mr.
Craig
,
the
gardener
,
he
was
a
sensible
man
enough
,
to
be
sure
,
but
he
was
knock
-
kneed
,
and
had
a
queer
sort
of
sing
-
song
in
his
talk
;
moreover
,
on
the
most
charitable
supposition
,
he
must
be
far
on
the
way
to
forty
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
quite
certain
her
uncle
wanted
her
to
encourage
Adam
,
and
would
be
pleased
for
her
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
For
those
were
times
when
there
was
no
rigid
demarcation
of
rank
between
the
farmer
and
the
respectable
artisan
,
and
on
the
home
hearth
,
as
well
as
in
the
public
house
,
they
might
be
seen
taking
their
jug
of
ale
together
;
the
farmer
having
a
latent
sense
of
capital
,
and
of
weight
in
parish
affairs
,
which
sustained
him
under
his
conspicuous
inferiority
in
conversation
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
was
not
a
frequenter
of
public
houses
,
but
he
liked
a
friendly
chat
over
his
own
home
-
brewed
;
and
though
it
was
pleasant
to
lay
down
the
law
to
a
stupid
neighbour
who
had
no
notion
how
to
make
the
best
of
his
farm
,
it
was
also
an
agreeable
variety
to
learn
something
from
a
clever
fellow
like
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
for
the
last
three
years
 
ever
since
he
had
superintended
the
building
of
the
new
barn
 
<EOS>
Adam
had
always
been
made
welcome
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
especially
of
a
winter
evening
,
when
the
whole
family
,
in
patriarchal
fashion
,
master
and
mistress
,
children
and
servants
,
were
assembled
in
that
glorious
kitchen
,
at
well
-
graduated
distances
from
the
blazing
fire
.
<EOS>
And
for
the
last
two
years
,
at
least
,
Hetty
had
been
in
the
habit
of
hearing
her
uncle
say
,
"
Adam
Bede
may
be
working
for
wage
now
,
but
he
'll
be
a
master
-
man
some
day
,
as
sure
as
I
sit
in
this
chair
.
<EOS>
Mester
Burge
is
in
the
right
on't
to
want
him
to
go
partners
and
marry
his
daughter
,
if
it
's
true
what
they
say
;
the
woman
as
marries
him
'
ull
have
a
good
take
,
be't
Lady
day
or
Michaelmas
,
"
a
remark
which
Mrs.
Poyser
always
followed
up
with
her
cordial
assent
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
she
would
say
,
"
it
's
all
very
fine
having
a
ready
-
made
rich
man
,
but
mayhappen
he
'll
be
a
ready
-
made
fool
;
and
it
's
no
use
filling
your
pocket
full
o
'
money
if
you
've
got
a
hole
in
the
corner
.

I
allays
said
I
'd
never
marry

man
as
had
got
no
brains

for
where
's
the
use
of
a
woman
having
brains
of
her
own
if
she
's
tackled
to
a
geck
as
everybody
's
a

laughing
at

She
might
as
well
dress

fine
to
sit

<EOS>
These
expressions
,
though
figurative
,
sufficiently
indicated
the
bent
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
mind
with
regard
to
Adam
;
and
though
she
and
her
husband
might
have
viewed
the
subject
differently
if
Hetty
had
been
a
daughter
of
their
own
,
it
was
clear
that
they
would
have
welcomed
the
match
with
Adam
for
a
penniless
niece
.
<EOS>
For
what
could
Hetty
have
been
but
a
servant
elsewhere
,
if
her
uncle
had
not
taken
her
in
and
brought
her
up
as
a
domestic
help
to
her
aunt
,
whose
health
since
the
birth
of
Totty
had
not
been
equal
to
more
positive
labour
than
the
superintendence
of
servants
and
children
?
<EOS>
But
Hetty
had
never
given
Adam
any
steady
encouragement
.
<EOS>
Even
in
the
moments
when
she
was
most
thoroughly
conscious
of
his
superiority
to
her
other
admirers
,
she
had
never
brought
herself
to
think
of
accepting
him
.
<EOS>
She
liked
to
feel
that
this
strong
,
skilful
,
keen
-
eyed
man
was
in
her
power
,
and
would
have
been
indignant
if
he
had
shown
the
least
sign
of
slipping
from
under
the
yoke
of
her
coquettish
tyranny
and
attaching
himself
to
the
gentle
Mary
Burge
,
who
would
have
been
grateful
enough
for
the
most
trifling
notice
from
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mary
Burge
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Such
a
sallow
-
faced
girl
:
if
she
put
on
a
bit
of
pink
ribbon
,
she
looked
as
yellow
as
a
crow
-
flower
and
her
hair
<EOS>
was
as
straight
as
a
hank
of
cotton
.
"
<EOS>
And
always
when
Adam
stayed
away
for
several
weeks
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
otherwise
made
some
show
of
resistance
to
his
passion
as
a
foolish
one
,
Hetty
took
care
to
entice
him
back
into
the
net
by
little
airs
of
meekness
and
timidity
,
as
if
she
were
in
trouble
at
his
neglect
.
<EOS>
But
as
to
marrying
Adam
,
that
was
a
very
different
affair
!
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
the
world
to
tempt
her
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
never
grew
a
shade
deeper
when
his
name
was
mentioned
;
she
felt
no
thrill
when
she
saw
him
passing
along
the
causeway
by
the
window
,
or
advancing
towards
her
unexpectedly
in
the
footpath
across
the
meadow
;
she
felt
nothing
,
when
his
eyes
rested
on
her
,
but
the
cold
triumph
of
knowing
that
he
loved
her
and
would
not
care
to
look
at
Mary
Burge
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
more
stir
in
her
the
emotions
that
make
the
sweet
intoxication
of
young
love
than
the
mere
picture
of
a
sun
can
stir
the
spring
sap
in
the
subtle
fibres
of
the
plant
.
<EOS>
She
saw
him
as
he
was
 
a
poor
man
with
old
parents
to
keep
,
who
would
not
be
able
,
for
a
long
while
to
come
,
to
give
her
even
such
luxuries
as
she
shared
in
her
uncle
's
house
.
<EOS>
And
Hetty
's
dreams
were
all
of
luxuries
:
to
sit
in
a
carpeted
parlour
,
and
always
wear
white
stockings
;
to
have
some
large
beautiful
ear
-
rings
,
such
as
were
all
the
fashion
;
to
have
Nottingham
lace
round
the
top
of
her
gown
,
and
something
to
make
her
handkerchief
smell
nice
,
like
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
's
when
she
drew
it
out
at
church
;
and
not
to
be
obliged
to
get
up
early
or
be
scolded
by
anybody
.
<EOS>
She
thought
,
if
Adam
had
been
rich
and
could
have
given
her
these
things
,
she
loved
him
well
enough
to
marry
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
for
the
last
few
weeks
a
new
influence
had
come
over
Hetty
 
<EOS>
vague
,
atmospheric
,
shaping
itself
into
no
self
-
confessed
hopes
or
prospects
,
but
producing
a
pleasant
narcotic
effect
,
making
her
tread
the
ground
and
go
about
her
work
in
a
sort
of
dream
,
unconscious
of
weight
or
effort
,
and
showing
her
all
things
through
a
soft
,
liquid
veil
,
as
if
she
were
living
not
in
this
solid
world
of
brick
and
stone
,
but
in
a
beatified
world
,
such
as
the
sun
lights
up
for
us
in
the
waters
.
<EOS>
Hetty
had
become
aware
that
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
would
take
a
good
deal
of
trouble
for
the
chance
of
seeing
her
;
that
he
always
placed
himself
at
church
so
as
to
have
the
fullest
view
of
her
both
sitting
and
standing
;
that
he
was
constantly
finding
reason
for
calling
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
always
would
contrive
to
say
something
for
the
sake
of
making
her
speak
to
him
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
The
poor
child
no
more
conceived
at
present
the
idea
that
the
young
squire
could
ever
be
her
lover
than
a
baker
's
pretty
daughter
in
the
crowd
,
whom
a
young
emperor
distinguishes
by
an
imperial
but
admiring
smile
,
conceives
that
she
shall
be
made
empress
.
<EOS>
But
the
baker
's
daughter
goes
home
and
dreams
of
the
handsome
young
emperor
,
and
perhaps
weighs
the
flour
amiss
while
she
is
thinking
what
a
heavenly
lot
it
must
be
to
have
him
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
And
so
,
poor
Hetty
had
got
a
face
and
a
presence
haunting
her
waking
and
sleeping
dreams
;
bright
,
soft
glances
had
penetrated
her
,
and
suffused
her
life
with
a
strange
,
happy
languor
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
that
shed
those
glances
were
really
not
half
so
fine
as
Adam
's
,
which
sometimes
looked
at
her
with
a
sad
,
beseeching
tenderness
,
but
they
had
found
a
ready
medium
in
Hetty
's
little
silly
imagination
,
whereas
Adam
's
could
get
no
entrance
through
that
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
For
three
weeks
,
at
least
,
her
inward
life
had
consisted
of
little
else
than
living
through
in
memory
the
looks
and
words
Arthur
had
directed
towards
her
 
of
little
else
than
recalling
the
sensations
with
which
she
heard
his
voice
outside
the
house
,
and
saw
him
enter
,
and
became
conscious
that
his
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
,
and
then
became
conscious
that
a
tall
figure
,
looking
down
on
her
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
touch
her
,
was
coming
nearer
in
clothes
of
beautiful
texture
with
an
odour
like
that
of
a
flower
-
garden
borne
on
the
evening
breeze
.
<EOS>
Foolish
thoughts
!
<EOS>
But
all
this
happened
,
you
must
remember
,
nearly
sixty
years
ago
,
and
Hetty
was
quite
uneducated
 
a
simple
farmer
's
girl
,
to
whom
a
gentleman
with
a
white
hand
was
dazzling
as
an
Olympian
god
.
<EOS>
Until
to
-
day
,
she
had
never
looked
farther
into
the
future
than
to
the
next
time
Captain
Donnithorne
would
come
to
the
Farm
,
or
the
next
Sunday
when
she
should
see
him
at
church
;
but
now
she
thought
,
perhaps
he
would
try
to
meet
her
when
she
went
to
the
Chase
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
and
if
he
should
speak
to
her
,
and
walk
a
little
way
,
when
nobody
was
by
!
<EOS>
That
had
never
happened
yet
;
and
now
her
imagination
,
instead
of
retracing
the
past
,
was
busy
fashioning
what
would
happen
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
whereabout
in
the
Chase
<EOS>
she
should
see
him
coming
towards
her
<EOS>
,
how
she
should
put
her
new
rose
-
coloured
ribbon
on
,
which
he
had
never
seen
,
and
what
he
would
say
to
her
to
make
her
return
his
glance
 
a
glance
which
she
would
be
living
through
in
her
memory
,
over
and
over
again
,
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
,
how
could
Hetty
give
any
feeling
to
Adam
's
troubles
,
or
think
much
about
poor
old
Thias
being
drowned
?
<EOS>
Young
souls
,
in
such
pleasant
delirium
as
hers
are
as
unsympathetic
as
butterflies
sipping
nectar
;
they
are
isolated
from
all
appeals
by
a
barrier
of
dreams
 
by
invisible
looks
and
impalpable
arms
.
  
<EOS>
While
Hetty
's
hands
were
busy
packing
up
the
butter
,
and
her
head
filled
with
these
pictures
of
the
morrow
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
riding
by
Mr.
Irwine
's
side
towards
the
valley
of
the
Willow
Brook
,
had
also
certain
indistinct
anticipations
,
running
as
an
undercurrent
in
his
mind
while
he
was
listening
to
Mr.
Irwine
's
account
of
Dinah
 
indistinct
,
yet
strong
enough
to
make
him
feel
rather
conscious
when
Mr.
Irwine
suddenly
said
,
"
What
fascinated
you
so
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
dairy
,
Arthur
?
<EOS>
Have
you
become
an
amateur
of
damp
quarries
and
skimming
dishes
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
knew
the
rector
too
well
to
suppose
that
a
clever
invention
would
be
of
any
use
,
so
he
said
,
with
his
accustomed
frankness
,
"
No
,
I
went
to
look
at
the
pretty
butter
-
maker
Hetty
Sorrel
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
perfect
Hebe
;
and
if
I
were
an
artist
,
I
would
paint
her
.
<EOS>
It
's
amazing
what
pretty
girls
one
sees
among
the
farmers
'
daughters
,
when
the
men
are
such
clowns
.
<EOS>
That
common
,
round
,
red
face
one
sees
sometimes
in
the
men
 
all
cheek
and
no
features
,
like
Martin
Poyser
's
 
comes
out
in
the
women
of
the
family
as
the
most
charming
phiz
imaginable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
have
no
objection
to
your
contemplating
Hetty
in
an
artistic
light
,
but
I
must
not
have
you
feeding
her
vanity
and
filling
her
little
noddle
with
the
notion
that
she
's
a
great
beauty
,
attractive
to
fine
gentlemen
,
or
you
will
spoil
her
for
a
poor
man
's
wife
 
honest
Craig
's
,
for
example
,
whom
I
have
seen
bestowing
soft
glances
on
her
.
<EOS>
The
little
puss
seems
already
to
have
airs
enough
to
make
a
husband
as
miserable
as
it
's
a
law
of
nature
for
a
quiet
man
to
be
when
he
marries
a
beauty
.
<EOS>
Apropos
of
marrying
<EOS>
,
I
hope
our
friend
Adam
will
get
settled
,
now
the
poor
old
man
's
gone
.
<EOS>
He
will
only
have
his
mother
to
keep
in
future
,
and
I
've
a
notion
that
there
's
a
kindness
between
him
and
that
nice
modest
girl
,
Mary
Burge
,
from
something
that
fell
from
old
Jonathan
one
day
when
I
was
talking
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
mentioned
the
subject
to
Adam
he
looked
uneasy
and
turned
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
love
-
making
does
n't
run
smooth
,
or
perhaps
Adam
hangs
back
till
he
's
in
a
better
position
.
<EOS>
He
has
independence
of
spirit
enough
for
two
men
 
rather
an
excess
of
pride
,
if
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
would
be
a
capital
match
for
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
would
slip
into
old
Burge
's
shoes
and
make
a
fine
thing
of
that
building
business
,
I
'll
answer
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
see
him
well
settled
in
this
parish
;
he
would
be
ready
then
to
act
as
my
grand
-
vizier
when
I
wanted
one
.
<EOS>
We
could
plan
no
end
of
repairs
and
improvements
together
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
seen
the
girl
,
though
,
I
think
 
at
least
I
've
never
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
her
next
Sunday
at
church
 
<EOS>
she
sits
with
her
father
on
the
left
of
the
reading
-
desk
.
<EOS>
You
need
n't
look
quite
so
much
at
Hetty
Sorrel
then
.
<EOS>
When
I
've
made
up
my
mind
that
I
ca
n't
afford
to
buy
a
tempting
dog
,
I
take
no
notice
of
him
,
because
if
he
took
a
strong
fancy
to
me
and
looked
lovingly
at
me
,
the
struggle
between
arithmetic
and
inclination
might
become
unpleasantly
severe
.
<EOS>
I
pique
myself
on
my
wisdom
there
,
Arthur
,
and
as
an
old
fellow
to
whom
wisdom
had
become
cheap
,
I
bestow
it
upon
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
.
<EOS>
It
may
stand
me
in
good
stead
some
day
though
I
do
n't
know
that
I
have
any
present
use
for
it
.
<EOS>
Bless
me
!
<EOS>
How
the
brook
has
overflowed
.
<EOS>
Suppose
we
have
a
canter
,
now
we
're
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
is
the
great
advantage
of
dialogue
on
horseback
;
it
can
be
merged
any
minute
into
a
trot
or
a
canter
,
and
one
might
have
escaped
from
Socrates
himself
in
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
were
free
from
the
necessity
of
further
conversation
till
they
pulled
up
in
the
lane
behind
Adam
's
cottage
.
    
<EOS>
Dinah
Visits
<EOS>
Lisbeth
  
<EOS>
AT
five
o'clock
<EOS>
Lisbeth
came
downstairs
with
a
large
key
in
her
hand
:
it
was
the
key
of
the
chamber
where
her
husband
lay
dead
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
day
,
except
in
her
occasional
outbursts
of
wailing
grief
,
she
had
been
in
incessant
movement
,
performing
the
initial
duties
to
her
dead
with
the
awe
and
exactitude
that
belong
to
religious
rites
.
<EOS>
She
had
brought
out
her
little
store
of
bleached
linen
,
which
she
had
for
long
years
kept
in
reserve
for
this
supreme
use
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
but
yesterday
 
that
time
so
many
midsummers
ago
,
when
she
had
told
Thias
where
this
linen
lay
,
that
he
might
be
sure
and
reach
it
out
for
her
when
SHE
died
,
for
she
was
the
elder
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Then
there
had
been
the
work
of
cleansing
to
the
strictest
purity
<EOS>
every
object
in
the
sacred
chamber
,
and
of
removing
from
it
every
trace
of
common
daily
occupation
.
<EOS>
The
small
window
,
which
had
hitherto
freely
let
in
the
frosty
moonlight
or
the
warm
summer
sunrise
on
the
working
man
's
slumber
,
must
now
be
darkened
with
a
fair
white
sheet
,
for
this
was
the
sleep
which
is
as
sacred
under
the
bare
rafters
as
in
ceiled
houses
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
had
even
mended
a
long
-
neglected
and
unnoticeable
rent
in
the
checkered
bit
of
bed
-
curtain
;
for
the
moments
were
few
and
precious
now
in
which
she
would
be
able
to
do
the
smallest
office
of
respect
or
love
for
the
still
corpse
,
to
which
in
all
her
thoughts
she
attributed
some
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Our
dead
are
never
dead
to
us
until
we
have
forgotten
them
:
they
can
be
injured
by
us
,
they
can
be
wounded
;
they
know
all
our
penitence
,
all
our
aching
sense
that
their
place
is
empty
,
all
the
kisses
we
bestow
on
the
smallest
relic
of
their
presence
.
<EOS>
And
the
aged
peasant
woman
most
of
all
believes
that
her
dead
are
conscious
.
<EOS>
Decent
burial
was
what
Lisbeth
had
been
thinking
of
for
herself
through
years
of
thrift
,
with
an
indistinct
expectation
that
she
should
know
when
she
was
being
carried
to
the
churchyard
,
followed
by
her
husband
and
her
sons
;
and
now
she
felt
as
if
the
greatest
work
of
her
life
were
to
be
done
in
seeing
that
Thias
was
buried
decently
before
her
 
under
the
white
thorn
,
where
once
,
in
a
dream
,
she
had
thought
she
lay
in
the
coffin
,
yet
all
the
while
saw
the
sunshine
above
and
smelt
the
white
blossoms
that
were
so
thick
upon
the
thorn
the
Sunday
<EOS>
she
went
to
be
churched
after
Adam
was
born
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
she
had
done
everything
that
could
be
done
to
-
day
in
the
chamber
of
death
 
<EOS>
had
done
it
all
herself
,
with
some
aid
from
her
sons
in
lifting
,
for
she
would
let
no
one
be
fetched
to
help
her
from
the
village
,
not
being
fond
of
female
neighbours
generally
;
and
her
favourite
Dolly
,
the
old
housekeeper
at
Mr.
Burge
's
,
who
had
come
to
condole
with
her
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
she
heard
of
Thias
's
death
,
was
too
dim
-
sighted
to
be
of
much
use
.
<EOS>
She
had
locked
the
door
,
and
now
held
the
key
in
her
hand
,
as
she
threw
herself
wearily
into
a
chair
that
stood
out
of
its
place
in
the
middle
of
the
house
floor
,
where
in
ordinary
times
she
would
never
have
consented
to
sit
.
<EOS>
The
kitchen
had
had
none
of
her
attention
that
day
;
it
was
soiled
with
the
tread
of
muddy
shoes
and
untidy
with
clothes
and
other
objects
out
of
place
.
<EOS>
But
what
at
another
time
would
have
been
intolerable
to
Lisbeth
's
habits
of
order
and
cleanliness
<EOS>
seemed
to
her
now
just
what
should
be
:
<EOS>
it
was
right
that
things
should
look
strange
and
disordered
and
wretched
,
now
the
old
man
had
come
to
his
end
in
that
sad
way
;
the
kitchen
ought
not
to
look
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
overcome
with
the
agitations
and
exertions
of
the
day
after
his
night
of
hard
work
,
had
fallen
asleep
on
a
bench
in
the
workshop
;
and
Seth
was
in
the
back
kitchen
making
a
fire
of
sticks
that
he
might
get
the
kettle
to
boil
,
and
persuade
his
mother
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
,
an
indulgence
which
she
rarely
allowed
herself
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
one
in
the
kitchen
when
Lisbeth
entered
and
threw
herself
into
the
chair
.
<EOS>
She
looked
round
with
blank
eyes
at
the
dirt
and
confusion
on
which
the
bright
afternoon
's
sun
shone
dismally
;
it
was
all
of
a
piece
with
the
sad
confusion
of
her
mind
 
<EOS>
that
confusion
which
belongs
to
the
first
hours
of
a
sudden
sorrow
,
when
the
poor
human
soul
is
like
one
who
has
been
deposited
sleeping
among
the
ruins
of
a
vast
city
,
and
wakes
up
in
dreary
amazement
,
not
knowing
whether
it
is
the
growing
or
the
dying
day
 
not
knowing
why
and
whence
came
this
illimitable
scene
of
desolation
,
or
why
he
too
finds
himself
desolate
in
the
midst
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
another
time
Lisbeth
's
first
thought
would
have
been
,
"
Where
is
Adam
?
"
<EOS>
but
the
sudden
death
of
her
husband
had
restored
him
in
these
hours
to
that
first
place
in
her
affections
which
he
had
held
six
-
and
-
twenty
years
ago
.
<EOS>
She
had
forgotten
his
faults
as
we
forget
the
sorrows
of
our
departed
childhood
,
and
thought
of
nothing
but
the
young
husband
's
kindness
and
the
old
man
's
patience
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
continued
to
wander
blankly
until
Seth
came
in
and
began
to
remove
some
of
the
scattered
things
,
and
clear
the
small
round
deal
table
that
he
might
set
out
his
mother
's
tea
upon
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
art
goin'
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
rather
peevishly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
thee
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
,
Mother
,
"
answered
Seth
,
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
It
'll
do
thee
good
;
and
I
'll
put
two
or
three
of
these
things
away
,
and
make
the
house
look
more
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Comfortable

<EOS>
How

<EOS>
There

"
she
went
on
,
the
tears
coming
when
she
began
to
speak
,
"

poor

"
  
<EOS>
Here
Lisbeth
broke
from
words
into
moans
,
swaying
herself
backwards
and
forwards
on
her
chair
.
<EOS>
Seth
,
always
timid
in
his
behaviour
towards
his
mother
,
from
the
sense
that
he
had
no
influence
over
her
,
felt
it
was
useless
to
attempt
to
persuade
or
soothe
her
till
this
passion
was
past
;
so
he
contented
himself
with
tending
the
back
kitchen
fire
and
folding
up
his
father
's
clothes
,
which
had
been
hanging
out
to
dry
since
morning
 
afraid
to
move
about
in
the
room
where
his
mother
was
,
lest
he
should
irritate
her
further
.
  
<EOS>
But
after
Lisbeth
had
been
rocking
herself
and
moaning
for
some
minutes
,
she
suddenly
paused
and
said
aloud
to
herself
,
"
I
'll
go
an
'
see
arter
Adam
,
for
I
canna
think
where
he
's
gotten
;
an
'
I
want
him
to
go
upstairs
wi
'
<EOS>
me
afore
<EOS>
it
's
dark
,
for
the
minutes
to
look
at
the
corpse
is
like
the
meltin
'
snow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
overheard
this
,
and
coming
into
the
kitchen
again
,
as
his
mother
rose
from
her
chair
,
he
said
,
"
Adam
's
asleep
in
the
workshop
,
mother
.
<EOS>
Thee'dst
better
not
wake
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
o'erwrought
with
work
and
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wake
him
?
<EOS>
Who
's
a
-
goin
'
to
wake
him
?
<EOS>
I
shanna
wake
him
wi
'
lookin
'
at
him
.
<EOS>
I
hanna
seen
the
lad
this
two
hour
 
<EOS>
I
'd
welly
forgot
as
he
'd
e'er
growed
up
from
a
babby
<EOS>
when
's
feyther
carried
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
seated
on
a
rough
bench
,
his
head
supported
by
his
arm
,
which
rested
from
the
shoulder
to
the
elbow
on
the
long
planing
-
table
in
the
middle
of
the
workshop
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
he
had
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
'
rest
and
had
fallen
asleep
without
slipping
from
his
first
attitude
of
sad
,
fatigued
thought
.
<EOS>
His
face
,
unwashed
since
yesterday
,
looked
pallid
and
clammy
;
his
hair
was
tossed
shaggily
about
his
forehead
,
and
his
closed
eyes
had
the
sunken
look
which
follows
upon
watching
and
sorrow
.
<EOS>
His
brow
was
knit
,
and
his
whole
face
had
an
expression
of
weariness
and
pain
.
<EOS>
Gyp
was
evidently
uneasy
,
for
he
sat
on
his
haunches
,
resting
his
nose
on
his
master
's
stretched
-
out
leg
,
and
dividing
the
time
between
licking
the
hand
that
hung
listlessly
down
and
glancing
with
a
listening
air
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
poor
dog
was
hungry
and
restless
,
but
would
not
leave
his
master
,
and
was
waiting
impatiently
for
some
change
in
the
scene
.
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
this
feeling
on
Gyp
's
part
that
,
when
Lisbeth
came
into
the
workshop
and
advanced
towards
Adam
as
noiselessly
as
she
could
,
her
intention
not
to
awaken
him
was
immediately
defeated
;
for
Gyp
's
excitement
was
too
great
to
find
vent
in
anything
short
of
a
sharp
bark
,
and
in
a
moment
Adam
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
his
mother
standing
before
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
unlike
his
dream
,
for
his
sleep
had
been
little
more
than
living
through
again
,
in
a
fevered
delirious
way
,
all
that
had
happened
since
daybreak
,
and
his
mother
with
her
fretful
grief
was
present
to
him
through
it
all
.
<EOS>
The
chief
difference
between
the
reality
and
the
vision
was
that
in
his
dream
Hetty
was
continually
coming
before
him
in
bodily
presence
 
strangely
mingling
herself
as
an
actor
in
scenes
with
which
she
had
nothing
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
was
even
by
the
Willow
Brook
;
she
made
his
mother
angry
by
coming
into
the
house
;
and
he
met
her
with
her
smart
clothes
quite
wet
through
,
as
he
walked
in
the
rain
to
Treddleston
,
to
tell
the
coroner
.
<EOS>
But
wherever
Hetty
came
,
his
mother
was
sure
to
follow
soon
;
and
when
he
opened
his
eyes
,
it
was
not
at
all
startling
to
see
her
standing
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
my
lad
,
my
lad
!
"
<EOS>
Lisbeth
burst
out
immediately
,
her
wailing
impulse
returning
,
for
grief
in
its
freshness
feels
the
need
of
associating
its
loss
and
its
lament
with
every
change
of
scene
and
incident
,
"
thee'st
got
nobody
now
but
thy
old
mother
to
torment
thee
and
be
a
burden
to
thee
.
<EOS>
Thy
poor
feyther
'
ull
ne'er
anger
thee
no
more
;
an
'
thy
mother
may
's
<EOS>
well
go
arter
him
 
<EOS>
the
sooner
the
better
 
<EOS>
for
I
'm
no
good
to
nobody
now
.
<EOS>
One
old
coat
'
ull
do
to
patch
another
,
but
it
's
good
for
nought
else
.
<EOS>
Thee'dst
<EOS>
like
to
ha
'
a
wife
to
mend
thy
clothes
an

thy

An

i

chimney

<EOS>
(
Adam
winced
and
moved
uneasily
;
he
dreaded
,
of
all
things
,
to
hear
his
mother
speak
of
Hetty
.
)
<EOS>
But
if
thy
feyther
had
lived
,
he
'd
<EOS>
ne'er
ha
'
wanted
me
to
go
to
make
room
for
another
,
for
he
could
no
more
ha
'
done
wi'out
<EOS>
me
nor
one
side
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
scissars
can
do
wi'out
th
'
other

<EOS>
Eh
,
we
should
ha
'
been
both
flung
away
together
<EOS>
,
an
'
then
I
shouldna
ha

seen
this
day
,
an
'
one

'

both
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Lisbeth
paused
,
but
Adam
sat
in
pained
silence
 
he
could
not
speak
otherwise
than
tenderly
to
his
mother
to
-
day
,
but
he
could
not
help
being
irritated
by
this
plaint
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
possible
for
poor
Lisbeth
to
know
how
it
affected
Adam
any
more
than
it
is
possible
for
a
wounded
dog
to
know
how
his
moans
affect
the
nerves
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
Like
all
complaining
women
,
she
complained
in
the
expectation
of
being
soothed
,
and
when
Adam
said
nothing
,
she
was
only
prompted
to
complain
more
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
thee
couldst
do
better
wi'out
<EOS>
me
,
for
thee
couldst
go
where

But
I
donna
want
to
say

<EOS>
let

bring

who

I

ne'er

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
unable
to
bear
this
any
longer
,
rose
silently
from
the
bench
and
walked
out
of
the
workshop
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
But
Lisbeth
followed
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee

<EOS>
I'n

like

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
turned
round
at
once
and
said
,
"
Yes
,
mother
;
let
us
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Seth
,
let
us
go
together
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
upstairs
,
and
for
five
minutes
<EOS>
all
was
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
the
key
was
turned
again
,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
did
not
come
down
again
;
he
was
too
weary
and
worn
-
out
to
encounter
more
of
his
mother
's
querulous
grief
,
and
he
went
to
rest
on
his
bed
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
no
sooner
entered
the
kitchen
and
sat
down
than
she
threw
her
apron
over
her
head
,
and
began
to
cry
and
moan
and
rock
herself
as
before
.
<EOS>
Seth
thought
,
"
She
will
be
quieter
by
and
by
,
now
we
have
been
upstairs
"
;
and
he
went
into
the
back
kitchen
again
,
to
tend
his
little
fire
,
hoping
that
he
should
presently
induce
her
to
have
some
tea
.
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
had
been
rocking
herself
in
this
way
for
more
than
five
minutes
,
giving
a
low
moan
with
every
forward
movement
of
her
body
,
when
she
suddenly
felt
a
hand
placed
gently
on
hers
,
and
a
sweet
treble
voice
said
to
her
,
"
Dear
sister
,
the
Lord
has
sent
me
to
see
if
I
can
be
a
comfort
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
paused
,
in
a
listening
attitude
,
without
removing
her
apron
from
her
face
.
<EOS>
The
voice
was
strange
to
her
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
her
sister
's
spirit
come
back
to
her
from
the
dead
after
all
those
years
?
<EOS>
She
trembled
and
dared
not
look
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
,
believing
that
this
pause
of
wonder
was
in
itself
a
relief
for
the
sorrowing
woman
,
said
no
more
just
yet
,
but
quietly
took
off
her
bonnet
,
and
then
,
motioning
silence
to
Seth
,
who
,
on
hearing
her
voice
,
had
come
in
with
a
beating
heart
,
laid
one
hand
on
the
back
of
Lisbeth
's
chair
and
leaned
over
her
,
that
she
might
be
aware
of
a
friendly
presence
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
Lisbeth
drew
down
her
apron
,
and
timidly
she
opened
her
dim
dark
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
saw
nothing
at
first
<EOS>
but
a
face
 
<EOS>
a
pure
,
pale
face
,
with
loving
grey
eyes
,
and
<EOS>
it
was
quite
unknown
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
wonder
increased
;
perhaps
it
WAS
an
angel
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
same
instant
Dinah
had
laid
her
hand
on
Lisbeth
's
again
,
and
the
old
woman
looked
down
at
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
much
smaller
hand
than
her
own
,
but
it
was
not
white
and
delicate
,
for
Dinah
had
never
worn
a
glove
in
her
life
,
and
her
hand
bore
the
traces
of
labour
from
her
childhood
upwards
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
looked
earnestly
at
the
hand
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
fixing
her
eyes
again
on
Dinah
's
face
,
said
,
with
something
of
restored
courage
,
but
in
a
tone
of
surprise
,
"
Why
,
ye're
a
workin
'
woman
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
am
Dinah
Morris
,
and
I
work
in
the
cotton
-
mill
when
I
am
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
said
Lisbeth
slowly
,
still
wondering
;
"
ye
comed
in
so
light
,
like
the
shadow
on
the
wall
,
an
'
spoke
i
'
<EOS>
my
ear
,
as
I
thought
ye
might
be
a
sperrit

<EOS>
Ye've

a'most
the

<EOS>
one
as

on

<EOS>
i
'
Adam
's
new
Bible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
from
the
Hall
Farm
now
.
<EOS>
You
know
Mrs.
Poyser
 
<EOS>
she
's
my
aunt
,
and
she
has
heard
of
your
great
affliction
,
and
is
very
sorry
;
and
I
'm
come
to
see
if
I
can
be
any
help
to
you
in
your
trouble
;
for
I
know
your
sons
Adam
and
Seth
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
no
daughter
;
and
when
the
clergyman
told
me
how
the
hand
of
God
was
heavy
upon
you
,
my
heart
went
out
towards
you
,
and
I
felt
a
command
to
come
and
be
to
you
in
the
place
of
a
daughter
in
this
grief
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
who
y

are
now
;
y
'
are
a
Methody
,
like
Seth
;
he
's
tould
me
on
you
,
"
said
Lisbeth
fretfully
<EOS>
,
her
overpowering
sense
of
pain
returning
,
now
her
wonder
was
gone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ye'll
make
it
out
as
trouble
's
a
good
thing
,
like
HE
allays
does
.
<EOS>
But
where
's
the
use
<EOS>
o

to
me
<EOS>
a

that'n
?
<EOS>
Ye
canna
make
the
smart
less
wi
'
talkin
'
.
<EOS>
Ye'll
ne'er
make
me
believe
as
it
's
better
for
me
not
to
ha
'
my
old
man
die
in
's
bed
<EOS>
,
if
he
must
die
,
an

the

an

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Lisbeth
began
to
cry
and
rock
herself
again
;
and
Dinah
said
,
"
Yes
,
dear
friend
,
your
affliction
is
great
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
hardness
of
heart
to
say
that
your
trouble
was
not
heavy
to
bear
.
<EOS>
God
did
n't
send
me
to
you
to
make
light
of
your
sorrow
,
but
to
mourn
with
you
,
if
you
will
let
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
a
table
spread
for
a
feast
,
and
was
making
merry
with
your
friends
,
you
would
think
it
was
kind
to
let
me
come
and
sit
down
and
rejoice
with
you
,
because
you
'd
think
I
should
like
to
share
those
good
things
;
but
I
should
like
better
to
share
in
your
trouble
and
your
labour
,
and
it
would
seem
harder
to
me
if
you
denied
me
that
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
send
me
away
?
<EOS>
You
're
not
angry
with
me
for
coming

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Nay

Sit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
took
care
not
to
betray
that
she
had
had
her
tea
,
and
accepted
Lisbeth
's
invitation
very
readily
,
for
the
sake
of
persuading
the
old
woman
herself
to
take
the
food
and
drink
she
so
much
needed
after
a
day
of
hard
work
and
fasting
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
so
happy
<EOS>
now
Dinah
was
in
the
house
that
he
could
not
help
thinking
her
presence
was
worth
purchasing
with
a
life
in
which
grief
incessantly
followed
upon
grief
;
but
the
next
moment
he
reproached
himself
 
<EOS>
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
rejoicing
in
his
father
's
sad
death
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
the
joy
of
being
with
Dinah
WOULD
triumph
 
<EOS>
it
was
like
the
influence
of
climate
,
which
no
resistance
can
overcome
.
<EOS>
And
the
feeling
even
suffused
itself
over
his
face
so
as
to
attract
his
mother
's
notice
,
while
she
was
drinking
her
tea
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
may'st
<EOS>
well
talk
o
'
<EOS>
trouble
bein
'
a
good
thing
,
Seth
,
for
thee

<EOS>
Thee

such
another

<EOS>
But
ye've
got
the
same
look
too
"
(
here
Lisbeth
turned
to
Dinah
)
.
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
it
's
wi
'
bein
'
a
Methody

<EOS>
Not
as
I

Eh

<EOS>
Well
,
if
the

are
fond

trouble

they
're
like
to

it

a
pity
they

take

worreted

I
'd
be
glad
for
the
worst
o'er
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Dinah
,
careful
not
to
oppose
any
feeling
of
Lisbeth
's
,
for
her
reliance
,
in
her
smallest
words
and
deeds
,
on
a
divine
guidance
,
always
issued
in
that
finest
woman
's
tact
which
proceeds
from
acute
and
ready
sympathy
;
"
yes
,
I
remember
too
,
when
my
dear
aunt
died
,
I
longed
for
the
sound
of
her
bad
cough
in
the
nights
,
instead
of
the
silence
that
came
when
she
was
gone
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
dear
friend
,
drink
this
other
cup
of
tea
and
eat
a
little
more
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Lisbeth
,
taking
the
cup
and
speaking
in
a
less
querulous
tone
,
"
had
ye
got
no
feyther
and
mother
,
then
,
as
ye
war
<EOS>
so
sorry
about
your
aunt
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
never
knew
a
father
or
mother
;
my
aunt
brought
me
up
from
a
baby
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
children
,
for
she
was
never
married
and
she
brought
me
up
as
tenderly
as
if
I
'd
been
her
own
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
she
'd
fine
work
wi
'
ye
<EOS>
,
I
'll
warrant
,
bringin
'
ye
up
from
a
babby
,
<EOS>
an
'
her
a
lone
woman
 
<EOS>
it
's
ill
bringin
'
up
a
cade
lamb
.
<EOS>
But
I
daresay
ye
warna
franzy
,
for
ye
look
as
if
ye'd
ne'er
been
angered
i
'
your
life
.
<EOS>
But
what
did
ye
do
when
your
aunt
died
,
an
'
why
didna
ye
come
to
live
in
this
country
,
bein
'
as
Mrs.
Poyser
's
your
aunt
too
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
,
seeing
that
Lisbeth
's
attention
was
attracted
,
told
her
the
story
of
her
early
life
 
<EOS>
how
she
had
been
brought
up
to
work
hard
,
and
what
sort
of
place
Snowfield
was
,
and
how
many
people
had
a
hard
life
there
 
all
the
details
that
she
thought
likely
to
interest
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
listened
,
and
forgot
to
be
fretful
,
unconsciously
subject
to
the
soothing
influence
of
Dinah
's
face
and
voice
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
she
was
persuaded
to
let
the
kitchen
be
made
tidy
;
for
Dinah
was
bent
on
this
,
believing
that
the
sense
of
order
and
quietude
around
her
would
help
in
disposing
Lisbeth
to
join
in
the
prayer
she
longed
to
pour
forth
at
her
side
.
<EOS>
Seth
,
meanwhile
,
went
out
to
chop
wood
,
for
he
surmised
that
Dinah
would
like
to
be
left
alone
with
his
mother
.
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
sat
watching
her
as
she
moved
about
in
her
still
quick
way
,
and
said
at
last
,
"
Ye've
got
a
notion
o
'
cleanin
'
up
.
<EOS>
I
wouldna
mind
ha'in
ye
for
a
daughter
,
for
ye
wouldna
spend
the
lad
's
wage
<EOS>
i
'
fine
clothes
an
'
waste
.
<EOS>
Ye're
not
like
<EOS>
the
lasses
o
'
this
countryside
.
<EOS>
I
reckon
folks
is
different
at
Snowfield
from
what
they
are
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
have
a
different
sort
of
life
,
many
of
'
em
,
"
said
Dinah
;
<EOS>
"
they
work
at
different
things
 
some
in
the
mill
,
and
many
in
the
mines
,
in
the
villages
round
about
.
<EOS>
But
the
heart
of
man
is
the
same
everywhere
,
and
there
are
the
children
of
this
world
and
the
children
of
light
there
as
well
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
But
we
've
many
more
Methodists
there
than
in
this
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
didna
know
as
the
Methody

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
"
said
Dinah
,
"
now
the
kitchen
looks
tidy
,
and
now
,
dear
Mother
 
for
I
'm
your
daughter
to
-
night
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
you
to
wash
your
face
and
have
a
clean
cap
on
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
what
David
did
,
when
God
took
away
his
child
from
him
?
<EOS>
While
the
child
was
yet
alive
he
fasted
and
prayed
to
God
to
spare
it
,
and
he
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
,
but
lay
on
the
ground
all
night
,
beseeching
God
for
the
child
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
knew
it
was
dead
,
he
rose
up
from
the
ground
and
washed
and
anointed
himself
,
and
changed
his
clothes
,
and
ate
and
drank
;
and
when
they
asked
him
how
it
was
that
he
seemed
to
have
left
off
grieving
now
the
child
was
dead
,
he
said
,
"
While
the
child
was
yet
alive
,
I
fasted
and
wept
;
for
I
said
,
Who
can
tell
whether
God
will
be
gracious
to
me
,
that
the
child
may
live
?
<EOS>
But
now
he
is
dead
,
<EOS>
wherefore
should
I
fast
?
<EOS>
Can
I
bring
him
back
again
?
<EOS>
I
shall
go
to
him
,
but
he
shall
not
return
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eh
,
that
's
a
true
word
,
"
said
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
"
Yea
,
my
old
man
wonna
come
back
to
me
,
but
I
shall
go
to
him
 
the
sooner
the
better
.
<EOS>
Well
,
ye
may
do
as
ye
like
<EOS>
wi
'
me
<EOS>
:
there
's
a
clean
cap
<EOS>
i
'
that
drawer
,
an
'
I
'll
go
<EOS>
i
'
the
back
kitchen
an
'
wash
my
face
.
<EOS>
An
'
Seth
,
thee
may'st
reach
down
Adam
's
new
Bible
wi
'
th
'
picters
in
,
an
'
she
shall
read
us
a
chapter
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
I
like
them
words
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
go
to
him
,
but
he
wonna
come
back
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Dinah
and
Seth
were
both
inwardly
offering
thanks
for
the
greater
quietness
of
spirit
that
had
come
over
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
This
was
what
Dinah
had
been
trying
to
bring
about
,
through
all
her
still
sympathy
and
absence
from
exhortation
.
<EOS>
From
her
girlhood
upwards
she
had
had
experience
among
the
sick
and
the
mourning
,
among
minds
hardened
and
shrivelled
through
poverty
and
ignorance
,
and
had
gained
the
subtlest
perception
of
the
mode
in
which
they
could
best
be
touched
and
softened
into
willingness
to
receive
words
of
spiritual
consolation
or
warning
.
<EOS>
As
Dinah
expressed
it
,
"
she
was
never
left
to
herself
;
but
it
was
always
given
her
when
to
keep
silence
and
when
to
speak
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
we
not
all
agree
to
call
rapid
thought
and
noble
impulse
by
the
name
of
inspiration
?
<EOS>
After
our
subtlest
analysis
of
the
mental
process
,
we
must
still
say
,
as
Dinah
did
,
that
our
highest
thoughts
and
our
best
deeds
are
all
given
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
there
was
earnest
prayer
 
<EOS>
there
was
faith
,
love
,
and
hope
pouring
forth
that
evening
in
the
little
kitchen
.
<EOS>
And
poor
,
aged
,
fretful
Lisbeth
,
without
grasping
any
distinct
idea
,
without
going
through
any
course
of
religious
emotions
,
felt
a
vague
sense
of
goodness
and
love
,
and
of
something
right
lying
underneath
and
beyond
all
this
sorrowing
life
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
understand
the
sorrow
;
but
,
for
these
moments
,
under
the
subduing
influence
of
Dinah
's
spirit
,
she
felt
that
she
must
be
patient
and
still
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
Cottage
  
<EOS>
IT
was
but
half
-
past
four
<EOS>
the
next
morning
when
Dinah
,
tired
of
lying
awake
listening
to
the
birds
and
watching
the
growing
light
through
the
little
window
in
the
garret
roof
,
rose
and
began
to
dress
herself
very
quietly
,
lest
she
should
disturb
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
But
already
some
one
else
was
astir
in
the
house
,
and
had
gone
downstairs
,
preceded
by
Gyp
.
<EOS>
The
dog
's
pattering
step
was
a
sure
sign
that
it
was
Adam
who
went
down
;
but
Dinah
was
not
aware
of
this
,
and
she
thought
it
was
more
likely
to
be
Seth
,
for
he
had
told
her
how
Adam
had
stayed
up
working
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
Seth
,
however
,
had
only
just
awakened
at
the
sound
of
the
opening
door
.
<EOS>
The
exciting
influence
of
the
previous
day
,
heightened
at
last
by
Dinah
's
unexpected
presence
,
had
not
been
counteracted
by
any
bodily
weariness
,
for
he
had
not
done
his
ordinary
amount
of
hard
work
;
and
so
when
he
went
to
bed
;
it
was
not
till
he
had
tired
himself
with
hours
of
tossing
wakefulness
that
drowsiness
came
,
and
led
on
a
heavier
morning
sleep
than
was
usual
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
But
Adam
had
been
refreshed
by
his
long
rest
,
and
with
his
habitual
impatience
of
mere
passivity
,
he
was
eager
to
begin
the
new
day
and
subdue
sadness
by
his
strong
will
and
strong
arm
.
<EOS>
The
white
mist
lay
in
the
valley
;
it
was
going
to
be
a
bright
warm
day
,
and
he
would
start
to
work
again
when
he
had
had
his
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
's
bearable
as
long
as
a
man
can
work
,
"
he
said
to
himself
;
"
the
natur
o
'
things
does
n't
change
,
though
it
seems
as
if
one
's
own
life
was
nothing
but
change
.
<EOS>
The
square
o
'
four
is
sixteen
,
and
you
must
lengthen
your
lever
in
proportion
to
your
weight
,
is
as
true
when
a
man
's
miserable
as
when
he
's
happy
;
and
the
best
o
'
working
is
,
it
gives
you
a
grip
hold
<EOS>
o
'
things
outside
your
own
lot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
dashed
the
cold
water
over
his
head
and
face
,
he
felt
completely
himself
again
,
and
with
his
black
eyes
as
keen
as
ever
and
his
thick
black
hair
all
glistening
with
the
fresh
moisture
,
he
went
into
the
workshop
to
look
out
the
wood
for
his
father
's
coffin
,
intending
that
he
and
Seth
should
carry
it
with
them
to
Jonathan
Burge
's
and
have
the
coffin
made
by
one
of
the
workmen
there
,
so
that
his
mother
might
not
see
and
hear
the
sad
task
going
forward
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
just
gone
into
the
workshop
when
his
quick
ear
detected
a
light
rapid
foot
on
the
stairs
 
certainly
not
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
bed
and
asleep
when
Dinah
had
come
in
,
in
the
evening
,
and
now
he
wondered
whose
step
this
could
be
.
<EOS>
A
foolish
thought
came
,
and
moved
him
strangely
.
<EOS>
As
if
it
could
be
Hetty
!
<EOS>
She
was
the
last
person
likely
to
be
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
felt
reluctant
to
go
and
look
and
have
the
clear
proof
that
it
was
some
one
else
.
<EOS>
He
stood
leaning
on
a
plank
he
had
taken
hold
of
,
listening
to
sounds
which
his
imagination
interpreted
for
him
so
pleasantly
that
the
keen
strong
face
became
suffused
with
a
timid
tenderness
.
<EOS>
The
light
footstep
moved
about
the
kitchen
,
followed
by
the
sound
of
the
sweeping
brush
,
hardly
making
so
much
noise
as
the
lightest
breeze
that
chases
the
autumn
leaves
along
the
dusty
path
;
and
Adam
's
imagination
saw
a
dimpled
face
,
with
dark
bright
eyes
and
roguish
smiles
looking
backward
at
this
brush
,
and
a
rounded
figure
just
leaning
a
little
to
clasp
the
handle
.
<EOS>
A
very
foolish
thought
 
it
could
not
be
Hetty
;
but
the
only
way
of
dismissing
such
nonsense
from
his
head
was
to
go
and
see
WHO
it
was
,
for
his
fancy
only
got
nearer
and
nearer
to
belief
while
he
stood
there
listening
.
<EOS>
He
loosed
the
plank
and
went
to
the
kitchen
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Adam
Bede
?
"
said
Dinah
,
in
her
calm
treble
,
pausing
from
her
sweeping
and
fixing
her
mild
grave
eyes
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
trust
you
feel
rested
and
strengthened
again
to
bear
the
burden
and
heat
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
like
dreaming
of
the
sunshine
and
awaking
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
seen
Dinah
several
times
,
but
always
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
where
he
was
not
very
vividly
conscious
of
any
woman
's
presence
except
Hetty
's
,
and
he
had
only
in
the
last
day
or
two
begun
to
suspect
that
Seth
was
in
love
with
her
,
so
that
his
attention
had
not
hitherto
been
drawn
towards
her
for
his
brother
's
sake
.
<EOS>
But
now
her
slim
figure
,
her
plain
black
gown
,
and
her
pale
serene
face
impressed
him
with
all
the
force
that
belongs
to
a
reality
contrasted
with
a
preoccupying
fancy
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
moment
or
two
he
made
no
answer
,
but
looked
at
her
with
the
concentrated
,
examining
glance
which
a
man
gives
to
an
object
in
which
he
has
suddenly
begun
to
be
interested
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
,
felt
a
painful
self
-
consciousness
;
there
was
something
in
the
dark
penetrating
glance
of
this
strong
man
so
different
from
the
mildness
and
timidity
of
his
brother
Seth
.
<EOS>
A
faint
blush
came
,
which
deepened
as
she
wondered
at
it
.
<EOS>
This
blush
recalled
Adam
from
his
forgetfulness
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
quite
taken
by
surprise
;
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
come
and
see
my
mother
in
her
trouble
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
gentle
grateful
tone
,
for
his
quick
mind
told
him
at
once
how
she
came
to
be
there
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
my
mother
was
thankful
to
have
you
,
"
he
added
,
wondering
rather
anxiously
what
had
been
Dinah
's
reception
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Dinah
,
resuming
her
work
,
"
she
seemed
greatly
comforted
after
a
while
,
and
she
's
had
a
good
deal
of
rest
in
the
night
,
by
times
.
<EOS>
She
was
fast
asleep
when
I
left
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
was
it
took
the
news
to
the
Hall
Farm
?
"
said
Adam
,
his
thoughts
reverting
to
some
one
there
;
he
wondered
whether
SHE
had
felt
anything
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
Mr.
Irwine
,
the
clergyman
,
told
me
,
and
my
aunt
was
grieved
for
your
mother
when
she
heard
it
,
and
wanted
me
to
come
;
and
so
is
my
uncle
,
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
,
now
he
's
heard
it
,
but
he
was
gone
out
to
Rosseter
all
yesterday
.
<EOS>
They
'll
look
for
you
there
as
soon
as
you
've
got
time
to
go
,
for
there
's
nobody
round
<EOS>
that
hearth
<EOS>
but
what
's
glad
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
,
with
her
sympathetic
divination
,
knew
quite
well
that
Adam
was
longing
to
hear
if
Hetty
had
said
anything
about
their
trouble
;
she
was
too
rigorously
truthful
for
benevolent
invention
,
but
she
had
contrived
to
say
something
in
which
Hetty
was
tacitly
included
.
<EOS>
Love
has
a
way
of
cheating
itself
consciously
,
like
a
child
who
plays
at
solitary
hide
-
and
-
seek
;
it
is
pleased
with
assurances
that
it
all
the
while
disbelieves
.
<EOS>
Adam
liked
what
Dinah
had
said
so
much
that
his
mind
was
directly
full
of
the
next
visit
he
should
pay
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
when
Hetty
would
perhaps
behave
more
kindly
to
him
than
she
had
ever
done
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
wo
n't
be
there
yourself
any
longer
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
go
back
to
Snowfield
on
Saturday
,
and
I
shall
have
to
set
out
to
Treddleston
early
,
to
be
in
time
for
the
Oakbourne
carrier
.
<EOS>
So
I
must
go
back
to
the
farm
to
-
night
,
that
I
may
have
the
last
day
with
my
aunt
and
her
children
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
stay
here
all
to
-
day
,
if
your
mother
would
like
me
;
and
her
heart
seemed
inclined
towards
me
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
then
,
she
's
sure
to
want
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
If
mother
takes
to
people
at
the
beginning
,
she
's
sure
to
get
fond
of
'em
;
but
she
's
a
strange
way
of
not
liking
young
women
.
<EOS>
Though
,
to
be
sure
,
"
Adam
went
on
,
smiling
,
"
her
not
liking
other
young
women
is
no
reason
why
she
should
n't
like
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hitherto
Gyp
had
been
assisting
at
this
conversation
in
motionless
silence
,
seated
on
his
haunches
,
and
alternately
looking
up
in
his
master
's
face
to
watch
its
expression
and
observing
Dinah
's
movements
about
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
The
kind
smile
with
which
Adam
uttered
the
last
words
was
apparently
decisive
with
Gyp
of
the
light
in
which
the
stranger
was
to
be
regarded
,
and
as
she
turned
round
after
putting
aside
her
sweeping
-
brush
,
he
trotted
towards
her
and
put
up
his
muzzle
against
her
hand
in
a
friendly
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
see
Gyp
bids
you
welcome
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
and
he
's
very
slow
to
welcome
strangers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
dog
!
<EOS>
"
said
Dinah
,
patting
the
rough
grey
coat
,
"
I
've
a
strange
feeling
about
the
dumb
things
as
if
they
wanted
to
speak
,
and
it
was
a
trouble
to
'em
because
they
could
n't
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
being
sorry
for
the
dogs
always
,
though
perhaps
there
's
no
need
.
<EOS>
But
they
may
well
have
more
in
them
than
they
know
how
to
make
us
understand
,
for
we
ca
n't
say
half
what
we
feel
,
with
all
our
words
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
came
down
now
,
and
was
pleased
to
find
Adam
talking
with
Dinah
;
he
wanted
Adam
to
know
how
much
better
she
was
than
all
other
women
.
<EOS>
But
after
a
few
words
of
greeting
,
Adam
drew
him
into
the
workshop
to
consult
about
the
coffin
,
and
Dinah
went
on
with
her
cleaning
.
  
<EOS>
By
six
o'clock
they
were
all
at
breakfast
with
Lisbeth
in
a
kitchen
as
clean
as
she
could
have
made
it
herself
.
<EOS>
The
window
and
door
were
open
,
and
the
morning
air
brought
with
it
a
mingled
scent
of
southernwood
,
thyme
,
and
sweet
-
briar
from
the
patch
of
garden
by
the
side
of
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Dinah
did
not
sit
down
at
first
,
but
moved
about
,
serving
the
others
with
the
warm
porridge
and
the
toasted
oat
-
cake
,
which
she
had
got
ready
in
the
usual
way
,
for
she
had
asked
Seth
to
tell
her
just
what
his
mother
gave
them
for
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
had
been
unusually
silent
since
she
came
downstairs
,
apparently
requiring
some
time
to
adjust
her
ideas
to
a
state
of
things
in
which
she
came
down
like
a
lady
to
find
all
the
work
done
,
and
sat
still
to
be
waited
on
.
<EOS>
Her
new
sensations
seemed
to
exclude
the
remembrance
of
her
grief
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
after
tasting
the
porridge
,
she
broke
silence
:
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
might
ha
'
made
the
parridge
worse
,
"
she
said
to
Dinah
;
"
I
can
ate
it
<EOS>
wi'out
<EOS>
its
turnin
'
my
stomach
.
<EOS>
It
might
ha
'
been
a
trifle
thicker
an
'
no

an

I

putten
a

but
how
's
ye

that
?
<EOS>
The
lads
arena
like
to
get
folks
as
'll
make
their
parridge
as
I'n
made
it
for
'em
<EOS>
;
it
's
well
if
they
get
onybody
as
'll
make
parridge
at
all
.
<EOS>
But
ye

do

wi

a

o

showin

;
for
ye're
a
stirrin

<EOS>
"
  
"
Makeshift

"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
think
the
house
looks
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
could
look
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thee

<EOS>
Nay
;
how
's
thee

<EOS>
Th

men

<EOS>
But

Thee'lt

"
  
"
Dinah
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
do
come
and
sit
down
now
and
have
your
breakfast
.
<EOS>
We

"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

<EOS>
Come

"
she
added
,
in
a
tone
of
complaining
affection
,
as
Dinah
sat
down
by
her
side
,
"
I
'll
be
loath
for
<EOS>
ye

go

but
ye

I

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
stay
till
to
-
night
if
you
're
willing
,
"
said
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
stay
longer
,
only
I
'm
going
back
to
Snowfield
on
Saturday
,
and
I
must
be
with
my
aunt
to

morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
I
'd
ne'er
go
back

<EOS>
My
old
man
come
from
that
Stonyshire
side
,
but
he
left
it
when
he
war
a
young
un
,
an
'
i
'
<EOS>
the
right
on't
too
;
for
he
said
as
there
war
no
wood
there
<EOS>
,
an
'
it
'
ud
ha
'
been
a
bad
country
for
a
carpenter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
remember
father
telling
me
when
I
was
a
little
lad
that
he
made
up
his
mind
<EOS>
if
ever
he
moved
it
should
be
south'ard
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
not
so
sure
about
it
.
<EOS>
Bartle
Massey
says
 
and
he
knows
the
South
 
as
the
northern
men
are
a
finer
breed
than
the
southern
,
harder
-
headed
and
stronger
-
bodied
,
and
a
deal
taller
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
says
in
some
o
'
those
counties
it
's
as
flat
as
the
back
o
'
your
hand
,
and
you
can
see
nothing
of
a
distance
without
climbing
up
the
highest
trees
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
abide
that
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
go
to
work
by
a
road
that
'll
take
me
up
a
bit
of
a
hill
,
and
see
the
fields
for
miles
round
me
,
and
a
bridge
,
or
a
town
,
or
a
bit
of
a
steeple
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
It
makes
you
feel
the
world
's
a
big
place
,
and
there
's
other
men
working
in
it
with
their
heads
and
hands
besides
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
th
'
hills
best
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
when
the
clouds
are
over
your
head
and
you
see
the
sun
shining
ever
so
far
off
,
over
the
Loamford
way
,
as
I
've
often
done
o
'
late
,
on
the
stormy
days
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
as
if
that
was
heaven
where
there
's
always
joy
and
sunshine
,
though
this
life
's
dark
and
cloudy
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
love
the
Stonyshire
side
,
"
said
Dinah
;
"
I
should
n't
like
to
set
my
face
towards
the
countries
where
they
're
rich
in
corn
and
cattle
,
and
the
ground
so
level
and
easy
to
tread
;
and
to
turn
my
back
on
the
hills
where
the
poor
people
have
to
live
such
a
hard
life
and
the
men
spend
their
days
in
the
mines
away
from
the
sunlight
.
<EOS>
It
's
very
blessed
on
a
bleak
cold
day
,
when
the
sky
is
hanging
dark
over
the
hill
,
to
feel
the
love
of
God
in
one
's
soul
,
and
carry
it
to
the
lonely
,
bare
,
stone
houses
,
where
there
's
nothing
else
to
give
comfort
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Eh
!
"
said
Lisbeth
,
"
that
's
very
well
for
ye
to
talk

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
But
,

she
went

looking
at

<EOS>
He
had
finished
his
breakfast
now
,
and
rose
as
he
was
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
art
goin'
to

"
asked
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
"
Set

"
No

<EOS>
"
Nay

Lisbeth
burst
out
in
an
eager
,
wailing
tone
;
"

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
's
eyes
met
Seth
's
,
which
looked
from
Dinah
to
him
rather
wistfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
No

Mother

"
he
said
,
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay

persisted
Lisbeth
,
beginning
to
cry
,
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
,
Adam
,
say
no
more
,
"
said
Seth
,
gently
,
though
his
voice
told
that
he
spoke
with
some
effort
;
"
Mother
's
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
to
work
,
and
do
thee
stay
at
home

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
passed
into
the
workshop
immediately
,
followed
by
Adam
;
while
Lisbeth
,
automatically
obeying
her
old
habits
,
began
to
put
away
the
breakfast
things
,
as
if
she
did
not
mean
Dinah
to
take
her
place
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Dinah
said
nothing
,
but
presently
used
the
opportunity
of
quietly
joining
the
brothers
in
the
workshop
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
already
got
on
their
aprons
and
paper
caps
,
and
Adam
was
standing
with
his
left
hand
on
Seth
's
shoulder
,
while
he
pointed
with
the
hammer
in
his
right
to
some
boards
which
they
were
looking
at
.
<EOS>
Their
backs
were
turned
towards
the
door
by
which
Dinah
entered
,
and
she
came
in
so
gently
that
they
were
not
aware
of
her
presence
till
they
heard
her
voice
saying
,
"
Seth
Bede
!
"
<EOS>
Seth
started
,
and
they
both
turned
round
.
<EOS>
Dinah
looked
as
if
she
did
not
see
Adam
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
Seth
's
face
,
saying
with
calm
kindness
,
"
I
wo
n't
say
farewell
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
again
when
you
come
from
work
.
<EOS>
So
as
I
'm
at
the
farm
before
dark
,
it
will
be
quite
soon
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Dinah
;
I
should
like
to
walk
home
with
you
once
more
.
<EOS>
It
'll
perhaps
be
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
tremor
in
Seth
's
voice
.
<EOS>
Dinah
put
out
her
hand
and
said
,
"
You
'll
have
sweet
peace
in
your
mind
to
-
day
,
Seth
,
for
your
tenderness
and
long
-
suffering
towards
your
aged
mother
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
round
and
left
the
workshop
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
she
had
entered
it
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
been
observing
her
closely
all
the
while
,
but
she
had
not
looked
at
him
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
she
was
gone
,
he
said
,
"
I
do
n't
wonder
at
thee
for
loving
her
,
Seth
.
<EOS>
She
's
got
a
face
like
a
lily
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
's
soul
rushed
to
his
eyes
and
lips
:
he
had
never
yet
confessed
his
secret
to
Adam
,
but
now
he
felt
a
delicious
sense
of
disburdenment
,
as
he
answered
,
"
Aye
,
Addy
,
I
do
love
her
 
too
much
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
she
doesna
love
me
,
lad
,
only
as
one
child
o
'
God
loves
another
.
<EOS>
She
'll
never
love
any
man
as
a
husband

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
lad
,
there
's
no
telling
;
thee
mustna
lose
heart
.
<EOS>
She
's
made
out
o
'
stuff
with
a
finer
grain
than
most
o
'
the
women
;
I
can
see
that
clear
enough
.
<EOS>
But
if
she
's
better
than
they
are
in
other
things
,
I
canna
think
she
'll
fall
short
of
'em
in
loving
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
more
was
said
.
<EOS>
Seth
set
out
to
the
village
,
and
Adam
began
his
work
on
the
coffin
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
help
the
lad
,
and
me
too
,
"
he
thought
,
as
he
lifted
the
board
.
<EOS>
"
We
're
like
enough
to
find
life
a
tough
job
 
hard
work
inside
and
out
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
strange
thing
to
think
of
a
man
as
can
lift
a
chair
with
his
teeth
and
walk
fifty
mile
on
end
,
trembling
and
turning
hot
and
cold
at
only
a
look
from
one
woman
out
of
all
the
rest
<EOS>
i
'
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
mystery
we
can
give
no
account
of
;
but
no
more
we
can
of
the
sprouting
o
'
<EOS>
the
seed
,
for
that
matter
.
"
    
<EOS>
In
the
Wood
  
<EOS>
THAT
same
Thursday
morning
,
as
Arthur
Donnithorne
was
moving
about
in
his
dressing
-
room
seeing
his
well
-
looking
British
person
reflected
in
the
old
-
fashioned
mirrors
,
and
stared
at
,
from
a
dingy
olive
-
green
piece
of
tapestry
,
by
Pharaoh
's
daughter
and
her
maidens
,
who
ought
to
have
been
minding
the
infant
<EOS>
Moses
,
he
was
holding
a
discussion
with
himself
,
which
,
by
the
time
his
valet
was
tying
the
black
silk
sling
over
his
shoulder
,
had
issued
in
a
distinct
practical
resolution
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
go
to
Eagledale
and
fish
for
a
week
or
so
,
"
he
said
aloud
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
you
with
me
,
Pym
,
and
set
off
this
morning
;
so
be
ready
by
half
-
past
eleven
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
low
whistle
,
which
had
assisted
him
in
arriving
at
this
resolution
,
here
broke
out
into
his
loudest
ringing
tenor
,
and
the
corridor
,
as
he
hurried
along
it
,
echoed
to
his
favourite
song
from
the
Beggar
's
Opera
,
"
When
the
heart
of
a
man
is
oppressed
with
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
an
heroic
strain
;
nevertheless
Arthur
felt
himself
very
heroic
as
he
strode
towards
the
stables
to
give
his
orders
about
the
horses
.
<EOS>
His
own
approbation
was
necessary
to
him
,
and
it
was
not
an
approbation
to
be
enjoyed
quite
gratuitously
;
it
must
be
won
by
a
fair
amount
of
merit
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
yet
forfeited
that
approbation
,
and
he
had
considerable
reliance
on
his
own
virtues
.
<EOS>
No
young
man
could
confess
his
faults
more
candidly
;
candour
was
one
of
his
favourite
virtues
;
and
how
can
a
man
's
candour
be
seen
in
all
its
lustre
unless
he
has
a
few
failings
to
talk
of
?
<EOS>
But
he
had
an
agreeable
confidence
that
his
faults
were
all
of
a
generous
kind
 
impetuous
,
warm
-
blooded
,
leonine
;
never
crawling
,
crafty
,
reptilian
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
possible
for
Arthur
Donnithorne
to
do
anything
mean
,
dastardly
,
or
cruel
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
I
'm
a
devil
of
a
fellow
for
getting
myself
into
a
hobble
,
but
I
always
take
care
<EOS>
the
load
shall
fall
on
my
own
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
Unhappily
,
there
is
no
inherent
poetical
justice
in
hobbles
,
and
they
will
sometimes
obstinately
refuse
to
inflict
their
worst
consequences
on
the
prime
offender
,
in
spite
of
his
loudly
expressed
wish
.
<EOS>
It
was
entirely
owing
to
this
deficiency
in
the
scheme
of
things
that
Arthur
had
ever
brought
any
one
into
trouble
besides
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
nothing
if
not
good
-
natured
;
and
all
his
pictures
of
the
future
,
when
he
should
come
into
the
estate
,
were
made
up
of
a
prosperous
,
contented
tenantry
,
adoring
their
landlord
,
who
would
be
the
model
of
an
English
gentleman
 
mansion
in
first
-
rate
order
,
all
elegance
and
high
taste
 
<EOS>
jolly
housekeeping
,
finest
stud
in
Loamshire
 
purse
open
to
all
public
objects
 
in
short
,
everything
as
different
as
possible
from
what
was
now
associated
with
the
name
of
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
And
one
of
the
first
good
actions
he
would
perform
in
that
future
should
be
to
increase
Irwine
's
income
for
the
vicarage
of
Hayslope
,
so
that
he
might
keep
a
carriage
for
his
mother
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
His
hearty
affection
for
the
rector
dated
from
the
age
of
frocks
and
trousers
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
affection
partly
filial
,
partly
fraternal
 
fraternal
enough
to
make
him
like
Irwine
's
company
better
than
that
of
most
younger
men
,
and
filial
enough
to
make
him
shrink
strongly
from
incurring
Irwine
's
disapprobation
.
  
<EOS>
You
perceive
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
was
"
a
good
fellow
"
 
all
his
college
friends
thought
him
such
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
bear
to
see
any
one
uncomfortable
;
he
would
have
been
sorry
even
in
his
angriest
moods
for
any
harm
to
happen
to
his
grandfather
;
and
his
Aunt
Lydia
herself
had
the
benefit
of
that
soft
-
heartedness
which
he
bore
towards
the
whole
sex
.
<EOS>
Whether
he
would
have
self
-
mastery
enough
to
be
always
as
harmless
and
purely
beneficent
as
his
good
-
nature
led
him
to
desire
,
was
a
question
that
no
one
had
yet
decided
against
him
;
he
was
but
twenty
-
one
,
you
remember
,
and
we
do
n't
inquire
too
closely
into
character
in
the
case
of
a
handsome
generous
young
fellow
,
who
will
have
property
enough
to
support
numerous
peccadilloes
 
<EOS>
who
,
if
he
should
unfortunately
break
a
man
's
legs
in
his
rash
driving
,
will
be
able
to
pension
him
handsomely
;
or
if
he
should
happen
to
spoil
a
woman
's
existence
for
her
,
will
make
it
up
to
her
with
expensive
bon
-
bons
,
packed
up
and
directed
by
his
own
hand
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
ridiculous
to
be
prying
and
analytic
in
such
cases
,
as
if
one
were
inquiring
into
the
character
of
a
confidential
clerk
.
<EOS>
We
use
round
,
general
,
gentlemanly
epithets
about
a
young
man
of
birth
and
fortune
;
and
ladies
,
with
that
fine
intuition
which
is
the
distinguishing
attribute
of
their
sex
,
see
at
once
that
he
is
"
nice
.
"
<EOS>
The
chances
are
that
he
will
go
through
life
without
scandalizing
any
one
;
a
seaworthy
vessel
that
no
one
would
refuse
to
insure
.
<EOS>
Ships
,
certainly
,
are
liable
to
casualties
,
which
sometimes
make
terribly
evident
some
flaw
in
their
construction
that
would
never
have
been
discoverable
in
smooth
water
;
and
many
a
"
good
fellow
,
"
through
a
disastrous
combination
of
circumstances
,
has
undergone
a
like
betrayal
.
  
<EOS>
But
we
have
no
fair
ground
for
entertaining
unfavourable
auguries
concerning
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
who
this
morning
proves
himself
capable
of
a
prudent
resolution
founded
on
conscience
.
<EOS>
One
thing
is
clear
:
Nature
has
taken
care
that
he
shall
never
go
far
astray
with
perfect
comfort
and
satisfaction
to
himself
;
he
will
never
get
beyond
that
border
-
land
of
sin
,
where
he
will
be
perpetually
harassed
by
assaults
from
the
other
side
of
the
boundary
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
be
a
courtier
of
Vice
,
and
wear
her
orders
in
his
button
-
hole
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
,
and
the
sun
was
shining
brilliantly
;
everything
was
looking
lovelier
for
the
yesterday
's
rain
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
pleasant
thing
on
such
a
morning
to
walk
along
the
well
-
rolled
gravel
on
one
's
way
to
the
stables
,
meditating
an
excursion
.
<EOS>
But
the
scent
of
the
stables
,
which
,
in
a
natural
state
of
things
,
ought
to
be
among
the
soothing
influences
of
a
man
's
life
,
always
brought
with
it
some
irritation
to
Arthur
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
having
his
own
way
in
the
stables
;
everything
was
managed
in
the
stingiest
fashion
.
<EOS>
His
grandfather
persisted
in
retaining
as
head
groom
an
old
dolt
whom
no
sort
of
lever
could
move
out
of
his
old
habits
,
and
who
was
allowed
to
hire
a
succession
of
raw
Loamshire
lads
as
his
subordinates
,
one
of
whom
had
lately
tested
a
new
pair
of
shears
by
clipping
an
oblong
patch
on
Arthur
's
bay
mare
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
things
is
naturally
embittering
;
one
can
put
up
with
annoyances
in
the
house
,
but
to
have
the
stable
made
a
scene
of
vexation
and
disgust
is
a
point
beyond
what
human
flesh
and
blood
can
be
expected
to
endure
long
together
without
danger
of
misanthropy
.
  
<EOS>
Old
John
's
wooden
,
deep
-
wrinkled
face
was
the
first
object
that
met
Arthur
's
eyes
as
he
entered
the
stable
-
yard
,
and
it
quite
poisoned
for
him
the
bark
of
the
two
bloodhounds
that
kept
watch
there
.
<EOS>
He
could
never
speak
quite
patiently
to
the
old
blockhead
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
Meg
saddled
for
me
and
brought
to
the
door
at
half
-
past
eleven
,
and
I
shall
want
Rattler
saddled
for
Pym
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
hear
,
I
hear
,
Cap'n
,
"
said
old
John
very
deliberately
,
following
the
young
master
into
the
stable
.
<EOS>
John
considered
a
young
master
as
the
natural
enemy
of
an
old
servant
,
and
young
people
in
general
as
a
poor
contrivance
for
carrying
on
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
went
in
for
the
sake
of
patting
Meg
,
declining
as
far
as
possible
to
see
anything
in
the
stables
,
lest
he
should
lose
his
temper
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
The
pretty
creature
was
in
one
of
the
inner
stables
,
and
turned
her
mild
head
as
her
master
came
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Little
Trot
,
a
tiny
spaniel
,
her
inseparable
companion
in
the
stable
,
was
comfortably
curled
up
on
her
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Meg
,
my
pretty
girl
,
"
said
Arthur
,
patting
her
neck
,
"
we
'll
have
a
glorious
canter
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
your
honour
,
I
donna
see
as
that
can
be
,
"
said
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
be
?
<EOS>
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
's
got
lamed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lamed
,
confound
you
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
th
'
lad
took
her
too
close
to
Dalton
's
hosses
,
an
'
one
on
'em
flung
out
at
her
,
an
'
she
's
got
her
shank
bruised
o
'
the
near
foreleg
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
judicious
historian
abstains
from
narrating
precisely
what
ensued
.
<EOS>
You
understand
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
strong
language
,
mingled
with
soothing
"
who
-
ho
's
"
while
the
leg
was
examined
;
that
John
stood
by
with
quite
as
much
emotion
as
if
he
had
been
a
cunningly
carved
crab
-
tree
walking
-
stick
,
and
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
presently
repassed
the
iron
gates
of
the
pleasure
-
ground
without
singing
as
he
went
.
  
<EOS>
He
considered
himself
thoroughly
disappointed
and
annoyed
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
another
mount
in
the
stable
for
himself
and
his
servant
besides
Meg
and
Rattler
.
<EOS>
It
was
vexatious
;
just
when
he
wanted
to
get
out
of
the
way
for
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
culpable
in
Providence
to
allow
such
a
combination
of
circumstances
.
<EOS>
To
be
shut
up
at
the
Chase
with
a
broken
arm
when
every
other
fellow
in
his
regiment
was
enjoying
himself
at
Windsor
 
shut
up
with
his
grandfather
,
who
had
the
same
sort
of
affection
for
him
as
for
his
parchment
deeds
!
<EOS>
And
to
be
disgusted
at
every
turn
with
the
management
of
the
house
and
the
estate
!
<EOS>
In
such
circumstances
a
man
necessarily
gets
in
an
ill
humour
,
and
works
off
the
irritation
by
some
excess
or
other
.
<EOS>
"
Salkeld
would
have
drunk
a
bottle
of
port
every
day
,
"
he
muttered
to
himself
,
"
but
I
'm
not
well
seasoned
enough
for
that
.
<EOS>
Well
,
since
I
ca
n't
go
to
Eagledale
,
I
'll
have
a
gallop
on
Rattler
to
Norburne
this
morning
,
and
lunch
with
Gawaine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Behind
this
explicit
resolution
there
lay
an
implicit
one
.
<EOS>
If
he
lunched
with
Gawaine
and
lingered
chatting
,
he
should
not
reach
the
Chase
again
till
nearly
five
,
when
Hetty
would
be
safe
out
of
his
sight
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
;
and
when
she
set
out
to
go
home
,
it
would
be
his
lazy
time
after
dinner
,
so
he
should
keep
out
of
her
way
altogether
.
<EOS>
There
really
would
have
been
no
harm
in
being
kind
to
the
little
thing
,
and
it
was
worth
dancing
with
a
dozen
ballroom
belles
only
to
look
at
Hetty
for
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
he
had
better
not
take
any
more
notice
of
her
;
it
might
put
notions
into
her
head
,
as
Irwine
had
hinted
;
though
Arthur
,
for
his
part
,
thought
girls
were
not
by
any
means
so
soft
and
easily
bruised
;
indeed
,
he
had
generally
found
them
twice
as
cool
and
cunning
as
he
was
himself
.
<EOS>
As
for
any
real
harm
in
Hetty
's
case
,
it
was
out
of
the
question
:
Arthur
Donnithorne
accepted
his
own
bond
for
himself
with
perfect
confidence
.
  
<EOS>
So
the
twelve
o'clock
sun
saw
him
galloping
towards
Norburne
;
and
by
good
fortune
Halsell
Common
lay
in
his
road
and
gave
him
some
fine
leaps
for
Rattler
.
<EOS>
Nothing
like
"
taking
"
a
few
bushes
and
ditches
for
exorcising
a
demon
;
and
it
is
really
astonishing
that
the
Centaurs
,
with
their
immense
advantages
in
this
way
,
have
left
so
bad
a
reputation
in
history
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
you
will
perhaps
be
surprised
to
hear
that
although
Gawaine
was
at
home
,
the
hand
of
the
dial
in
the
courtyard
had
scarcely
cleared
the
last
stroke
of
three
when
Arthur
returned
through
the
entrance
-
gates
,
got
down
from
the
panting
Rattler
,
and
went
into
the
house
to
take
a
hasty
luncheon
.
<EOS>
But
I
believe
there
have
been
men
since
his
day
who
have
ridden
a
long
way
to
avoid
a
rencontre
,
and
then
galloped
hastily
back
lest
they
should
miss
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
favourite
stratagem
of
our
passions
to
sham
a
retreat
,
and
to
turn
sharp
round
upon
us
at
the
moment
we
have
made
up
our
minds
that
the
day
is
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
cap'n
's
been
ridin
'
the
devil
's
own
pace
,
"
said
Dalton
the
coachman
,
whose
person
stood
out
in
high
relief
as
he
smoked
his
pipe
against
the
stable
wall
,
when
John
brought
up
Rattler
.
  
<EOS>
"
An
'
I
wish
he
'd
get
the
devil
to
do
's
grooming
for'n
,
"
growled
John
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
;
he
'd
hev
a
deal
haimabler
groom
nor
what
he
has
now
<EOS>
,
"
observed
Dalton
 
and
the
joke
appeared
to
him
so
good
that
,
being
left
alone
upon
the
scene
<EOS>
,
he
continued
at
intervals
to
take
his
pipe
from
his
mouth
in
order
to
wink
at
an
imaginary
audience
and
shake
luxuriously
with
a
silent
,
ventral
laughter
,
mentally
rehearsing
the
dialogue
from
the
beginning
,
that
he
might
recite
it
with
effect
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
  
<EOS>
When
Arthur
went
up
to
his
dressing
-
room
again
after
luncheon
,
it
was
inevitable
that
the
debate
he
had
had
with
himself
there
earlier
in
the
day
should
flash
across
his
mind
;
but
it
was
impossible
for
him
now
to
dwell
on
the
remembrance
 
impossible
to
recall
the
feelings
and
reflections
which
had
been
decisive
with
him
then
,
any
more
than
to
recall
the
peculiar
scent
of
the
air
that
had
freshened
him
when
he
first
opened
his
window
.
<EOS>
The
desire
to
see
Hetty
had
rushed
back
like
an
ill
-
stemmed
current
;
he
was
amazed
himself
at
the
force
with
which
this
trivial
fancy
seemed
to
grasp
him
<EOS>
:
he
was
even
rather
tremulous
as
he
brushed
his
hair
 
pooh
!
<EOS>
it
was
riding
in
that
break
-
neck
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
because
he
had
made
a
serious
affair
of
an
idle
matter
,
by
thinking
of
it
as
if
it
were
of
any
consequence
.
<EOS>
He
would
amuse
himself
by
seeing
Hetty
to
-
day
,
and
get
rid
of
the
whole
thing
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
all
Irwine
's
fault
.
<EOS>
"
If
Irwine
had
said
nothing
,
I
should
n't
have
thought
half
so
much
of
Hetty
as
of
Meg
's
lameness
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
just
the
sort
of
day
for
lolling
in
the
Hermitage
,
and
he
would
go
and
finish
Dr.
Moore
's
Zeluco
there
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
The
Hermitage
stood
in
Fir
-
tree
Grove
 
<EOS>
the
way
Hetty
was
sure
to
come
in
walking
from
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
So
nothing
could
be
simpler
and
more
natural
:
meeting
Hetty
was
a
mere
circumstance
of
his
walk
,
not
its
object
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
's
shadow
flitted
rather
faster
among
the
sturdy
oaks
of
the
Chase
than
might
have
been
expected
from
the
shadow
of
a
tired
man
on
a
warm
afternoon
,
and
it
was
still
scarcely
four
o'clock
when
he
stood
before
the
tall
narrow
gate
leading
into
the
delicious
labyrinthine
wood
which
skirted
one
side
of
the
Chase
,
and
which
was
called
Fir
-
tree
Grove
,
not
because
the
firs
were
many
,
but
because
they
were
few
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
wood
of
beeches
and
limes
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
a
light
silver
-
stemmed
birch
 
<EOS>
just
the
sort
of
wood
most
haunted
by
the
nymphs
<EOS>
:
you
see
their
white
sunlit
limbs
gleaming
athwart
the
boughs
,
or
peeping
from
behind
the
smooth
-
sweeping
outline
of
a
tall
lime
;
you
hear
their
soft
liquid
laughter
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
look
with
a
too
curious
sacrilegious
eye
,
they
vanish
behind
the
silvery
beeches
<EOS>
,
they
make
you
believe
that
their
voice
was
only
a
running
brooklet
,
perhaps
they
metamorphose
themselves
into
a
tawny
squirrel
that
scampers
away
and
mocks
you
from
the
topmost
bough
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
grove
with
measured
grass
or
rolled
gravel
for
you
to
tread
upon
,
but
with
narrow
,
hollow
-
shaped
,
earthy
paths
,
edged
with
faint
dashes
of
delicate
moss
 
paths
which
look
as
if
they
were
made
by
the
free
will
of
the
trees
and
underwood
,
moving
reverently
aside
to
look
at
the
tall
queen
of
the
white
-
footed
nymphs
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
along
the
broadest
of
these
paths
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
passed
,
under
an
avenue
of
limes
and
beeches
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
still
afternoon
 
<EOS>
the
golden
light
was
lingering
languidly
among
the
upper
boughs
,
only
glancing
down
here
<EOS>
and
there
on
the
purple
pathway
and
its
edge
of
faintly
sprinkled
moss
:
an
afternoon
in
which
destiny
disguises
her
cold
awful
face
behind
a
hazy
radiant
veil
,
encloses
us
in
warm
downy
wings
,
and
poisons
us
with
violet
-
scented
breath
.
<EOS>
Arthur
strolled
along
carelessly
,
with
a
book
under
his
arm
,
but
not
looking
on
the
ground
as
meditative
men
are
apt
to
do
;
his
eyes
WOULD
fix
themselves
on
the
distant
bend
in
the
road
round
which
a
little
figure
must
surely
appear
before
long
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
There
she
comes
.
<EOS>
First
a
bright
patch
of
colour
,
like
a
tropic
bird
among
the
boughs
;
then
a
tripping
figure
,
with
a
round
hat
on
,
and
a
small
basket
under
her
arm
;
then
a
deep
-
blushing
,
almost
frightened
,
but
bright
-
smiling
girl
,
making
her
curtsy
with
a
fluttered
yet
happy
glance
,
as
Arthur
came
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
If
Arthur
had
had
time
to
think
at
all
,
he
would
have
thought
it
strange
that
he
should
feel
fluttered
too
,
be
conscious
of
blushing
too
 
in
fact
,
look
and
feel
as
foolish
as
if
he
had
been
taken
by
surprise
instead
of
meeting
just
what
he
expected
.
<EOS>
Poor
things
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
pity
they
were
not
in
that
golden
age
of
childhood
when
they
would
have
stood
face
to
face
,
eyeing
each
other
with
timid
liking
,
then
given
each
other
a
little
butterfly
kiss
,
and
toddled
off
to
play
together
.
<EOS>
Arthur
would
have
gone
home
to
his
silk
-
curtained
cot
,
and
Hetty
to
her
home
-
spun
pillow
,
and
both
would
have
slept
without
dreams
,
and
to
-
morrow
would
have
been
a
life
hardly
conscious
of
a
yesterday
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
turned
round
and
walked
by
Hetty
's
side
without
giving
a
reason
.
<EOS>
They
were
alone
together
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
What
an
overpowering
presence
that
first
privacy
is
!
<EOS>
He
actually
dared
not
look
at
this
little
butter
-
maker
for
the
first
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
As
for
Hetty
,
her
feet
rested
on
a
cloud
,
and
she
was
borne
along
by
warm
zephyrs
;
she
had
forgotten
her
rose
-
coloured
ribbons
;
she
was
no
more
conscious
of
her
limbs
than
if
her
childish
soul
had
passed
into
a
water
-
lily
,
resting
on
a
liquid
bed
and
warmed
by
the
midsummer
sun
-
beams
.
<EOS>
It
may
seem
a
contradiction
,
but
Arthur
gathered
a
certain
carelessness
and
confidence
from
his
timidity
:
it
was
an
entirely
different
state
of
mind
from
what
he
had
expected
in
such
a
meeting
with
Hetty
;
and
full
as
he
was
of
vague
feeling
,
there
was
room
,
in
those
moments
of
silence
,
for
the
thought
that
his
previous
debates
and
scruples
were
needless
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
to
choose
this
way
of
coming
to
the
Chase
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
looking
down
at
Hetty
;
"
it
is
so
much
prettier
as
well
as
shorter
than
coming
by
either
of
the
lodges
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
Hetty
answered
,
with
a
tremulous
,
almost
whispering
voice
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
know
one
bit
how
to
speak
to
a
gentleman
like
Mr.
Arthur
,
and
her
very
vanity
made
her
more
coy
of
speech
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
come
every
week
to
see
Mrs.
Pomfret
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
every
Thursday
,
only
when
she
's
got
to
go
out
with
Miss
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
she
's
teaching
you
something
,
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
the
lace
-
mending
as
she
learnt
abroad
,
and
the
stocking
-
mending
 
<EOS>
it
looks
just
like
the
stocking
,
you
ca
n't
tell
it
's
been
mended
;
and
she
teaches
me
cutting
-
out
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
are
YOU
going
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
be
one
very
much
indeed
.
"
<EOS>
Hetty
spoke
more
audibly
now
,
but
still
rather
tremulously
;
she
thought
,
perhaps
she
seemed
as
stupid
to
Captain
Donnithorne
as
Luke
Britton
did
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Mrs.
Pomfret
always
expects
you
at
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
expects
me
at
four
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
'm
rather
late
to
-
day
,
because
my
aunt
could
n't
spare
me
;
but
the
regular
time
is
four
,
because
that
gives
us
time
before
Miss
Donnithorne
's
bell
rings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
then
,
I
must
not
keep
you
now
,
else
I
should
like
to
show
you
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
walk
where
we
turn
up
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
not
go
now
.
<EOS>
I
'll
show
it
you
some
other
time
,
if
you
'd
like
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
please
,
sir
.
"
  
"
Do
you
always
come
back
this
way
in
the
evening
,
or
are
you
afraid
to
come
so
lonely
a
road
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
sir
,
it
's
never
late
;
I
always
set
out
by
eight
o'clock
,
and
it
's
so
light
now
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
would
be
angry
with
me
if
I
did
n't
get
home
before
nine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
Craig
,
the
gardener
,
comes
to
take
care
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
deep
blush
overspread
Hetty
's
face
and
neck
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
he
does
n't
;
I
'm
sure
he
never
did
;
I
would
n't
let
him
;
I
do
n't
like
him
,
"
she
said
hastily
,
and
the
tears
of
vexation
had
come
so
fast
that
before
she
had
done
speaking
a
bright
drop
rolled
down
her
hot
cheek
.
<EOS>
Then
she
felt
ashamed
to
death
that
she
was
crying
,
and
for
one
long
instant
her
happiness
was
all
gone
.
<EOS>
But
in
the
next
she
felt
an
arm
steal
round
her
,
and
a
gentle
voice
said
,
"
Why
,
Hetty
,
what
makes
you
cry
?
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
to
vex
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
vex
you
for
the
world
,
you
little
blossom
.
<EOS>
Come
,
do
n't
cry
<EOS>
;
look
at
me
,
else
I
shall
think
you
wo
n't
forgive
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
had
laid
his
hand
on
the
soft
arm
that
was
nearest
to
him
,
and
was
stooping
towards
Hetty
with
a
look
of
coaxing
entreaty
.
<EOS>
Hetty
lifted
her
long
dewy
lashes
,
and
met
the
eyes
that
were
bent
towards
her
with
a
sweet
,
timid
,
beseeching
look
.
<EOS>
What
a
space
of
time
those
three
moments
were
while
their
eyes
met
and
his
arms
touched
her
!
<EOS>
Love
is
such
a
simple
thing
when
we
have
only
one
-
and
-
twenty
summers
and
a
sweet
girl
of
seventeen
trembles
under
our
glance
,
as
if
she
were
a
bud
first
opening
her
heart
with
wondering
rapture
to
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Such
young
unfurrowed
souls
roll
to
meet
each
other
like
two
velvet
peaches
that
touch
softly
and
are
at
rest
;
they
mingle
as
easily
as
two
brooklets
that
ask
for
nothing
but
to
entwine
themselves
and
ripple
with
ever
-
interlacing
curves
in
the
leafiest
hiding
-
places
.
<EOS>
While
Arthur
gazed
into
Hetty
's
dark
beseeching
eyes
,
it
made
no
difference
to
him
what
sort
of
English
she
spoke
;
and
even
if
hoops
and
powder
had
been
in
fashion
,
he
would
very
likely
not
have
been
sensible
just
then
that
Hetty
wanted
those
signs
of
high
breeding
.
  
<EOS>
But
they
started
asunder
with
beating
hearts
:
something
had
fallen
on
the
ground
with
a
rattling
noise
;
it
was
Hetty
's
basket
;
all
her
little
workwoman
's
matters
were
scattered
on
the
path
,
some
of
them
showing
a
capability
of
rolling
to
great
lengths
.
<EOS>
There
was
much
to
be
done
in
picking
up
,
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
;
but
when
Arthur
hung
the
basket
over
her
arm
again
,
the
poor
child
felt
a
strange
difference
in
his
look
and
manner
.
<EOS>
He
just
pressed
her
hand
,
and
said
,
with
a
look
and
tone
that
were
almost
chilling
to
her
,
"
I
have
been
hindering
you
;
I
must
not
keep
you
any
longer
now
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
expected
at
the
house
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
her
to
speak
,
he
turned
away
from
her
and
hurried
back
towards
the
road
that
led
to
the
Hermitage
,
leaving
Hetty
to
pursue
her
way
in
a
strange
dream
that
seemed
to
have
begun
in
bewildering
delight
and
was
now
passing
into
contrarieties
and
sadness
.
<EOS>
Would
he
meet
her
again
as
she
came
home
?
<EOS>
Why
had
he
spoken
almost
as
if
he
were
displeased
with
her
?
<EOS>
And
then
run
away
so
suddenly
?
<EOS>
She
cried
,
hardly
knowing
why
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
too
was
very
uneasy
,
but
his
feelings
were
lit
up
for
him
by
a
more
distinct
consciousness
.
<EOS>
He
hurried
to
the
Hermitage
,
which
stood
in
the
heart
of
the
wood
,
unlocked
the
door
with
a
hasty
wrench
,
slammed
it
after
him
,
pitched
Zeluco
into
the
most
distant
corner
,
and
thrusting
his
right
hand
into
his
pocket
,
first
walked
four
or
five
times
up
and
down
the
scanty
length
of
the
little
room
,
and
then
seated
himself
on
the
ottoman
in
an
uncomfortable
stiff
way
,
as
we
often
do
when
we
wish
not
to
abandon
ourselves
to
feeling
.

He
was
getting
in
love
with
Hetty
 
<EOS>
that
was
quite
plain
.
<EOS>
He
was
ready
to
pitch
everything
else
 
<EOS>
no
matter
where
 
for
the
sake
of
surrendering
himself
to
this
delicious
feeling
which
had
just
disclosed
itself
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
use
blinking
the
fact
now
 
they
would
get
too
fond
of
each
other
,
if
he
went
on
taking
notice
of
her
 
and
what
would
come
of
it
?
<EOS>
He
should
have
to
go
away
in
a
few
weeks
,
and
the
poor
little
thing
would
be
miserable
.
<EOS>
He
MUST
NOT
see
her
alone
again
;
he
must
keep
out
of
her
way
.
<EOS>
What
a
fool
he
was
for
coming
back
from
Gawaine
's
!
  
<EOS>
He
got
up
and
threw
open
the
windows
,
to
let
in
the
soft
breath
of
the
afternoon
,
and
the
healthy
scent
of
the
firs
that
made
a
belt
round
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
The
soft
air
did
not
help
his
resolution
,
as
he
leaned
out
and
looked
into
the
leafy
distance
.
<EOS>
But
he
considered
his
resolution
sufficiently
fixed
:
there
was
no
need
to
debate
with
himself
any
longer
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
meet
Hetty
again
;
and
now
he
might
give
himself
up
to
thinking
how
immensely
agreeable
it
would
be
if
circumstances
were
different
 
<EOS>
how
pleasant
it
would
have
been
to
meet
her
this
evening
as
she
came
back
,
and
put
his
arm
round
her
again
and
look
into
her
sweet
face
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
if
the
dear
little
thing
were
thinking
of
him
too
 
twenty
to
one
she
was
.
<EOS>
How
beautiful
her
eyes
were
with
the
tear
on
their
lashes
!
<EOS>
He
would
like
to
satisfy
his
soul
for
a
day
with
looking
at
them
,
and
he
MUST
see
her
again
 
<EOS>
he
must
see
her
,
simply
to
remove
any
false
impression
from
her
mind
about
his
manner
to
her
just
now
.
<EOS>
He
would
behave
in
a
quiet
,
kind
way
to
her
 
just
to
prevent
her
from
going
home
with
her
head
full
of
wrong
fancies
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
would
be
the
best
thing
to
do
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
while
 
more
than
an
hour
before
Arthur
had
brought
his
meditations
to
this
point
;
but
once
arrived
there
,
he
could
stay
no
longer
at
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
The
time
must
be
filled
up
with
movement
until
he
should
see
Hetty
again
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
already
late
enough
to
go
and
dress
for
dinner
,
for
his
grandfather
's
dinner
-
hour
was
six
.
    
<EOS>
Evening
in
the
Wood
  
<EOS>
IT
happened
that
Mrs.
Pomfret
had
had
a
slight
quarrel
with
Mrs.
Best
,
the
housekeeper
,
on
this
Thursday
morning
 
a
fact
which
had
two
consequences
highly
convenient
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
It
caused
Mrs.
Pomfret
to
have
tea
sent
up
to
her
own
room
,
and
it
inspired
that
exemplary
lady
's
maid
with
so
lively
a
recollection
of
former
passages
in
Mrs.
Best
's
conduct
,
and
of
dialogues
in
which
Mrs.
Best
had
decidedly
the
inferiority
as
an
interlocutor
with
Mrs.
Pomfret
,
that
Hetty
required
no
more
presence
of
mind
than
was
demanded
for
using
her
needle
,
and
throwing
in
an
occasional
"
yes
"
or
"
no
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
have
wanted
to
put
on
her
hat
earlier
than
usual
;
only
she
had
told
Captain
Donnithorne
that
she
usually
set
out
about
eight
o'clock
,
and
if
he
SHOULD
go
to
the
Grove
again
expecting
to
see
her
,
and
she
should
be
gone
!
<EOS>
Would
he
come
?
<EOS>
Her
little
butterfly
soul
fluttered
incessantly
between
memory
and
dubious
expectation
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
minute
-
hand
of
the
old
-
fashioned
brazen
-
faced
timepiece
was
on
the
last
quarter
to
eight
,
and
there
was
every
reason
for
its
being
time
to
get
ready
for
departure
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Pomfret
's
preoccupied
mind
did
not
prevent
her
from
noticing
what
looked
like
a
new
flush
of
beauty
in
the
little
thing
as
she
tied
on
her
hat
before
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
child
gets
prettier
and
prettier
every
day
<EOS>
,
I
do
believe
,
"
was
her
inward
comment
.
<EOS>
"
The
more
's
the
pity
.
<EOS>
She
'll
get
neither
a
place
nor
a
husband
any
the
sooner
for
it
.
<EOS>
Sober
well
-
to
-
do
men
do
n't
like
such
pretty
wives
.
<EOS>
When
I
was
a
girl
,
I
was
more
admired
than
if
I
had
been
so
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
's
reason
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
teaching
her
something
to
get
her
bread
with
,
better
than
farm
-
house
work
.
<EOS>
They
always
told
me
I
was
good
-
natured
 
<EOS>
and
that
's
the
truth
,
and
to
my
hurt
too
,
else
there
's
them
in
this
house
that
would
n't
be
here
now
to
lord
it
over
me
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
walked
hastily
across
the
short
space
of
pleasure
-
ground
which
she
had
to
traverse
,
dreading
to
meet
Mr.
Craig
,
to
whom
she
could
hardly
have
spoken
civilly
.
<EOS>
How
relieved
she
was
when
she
had
got
safely
under
the
oaks
and
among
the
fern
of
the
Chase
!
<EOS>
Even
then
she
was
as
ready
to
be
startled
as
the
deer
that
leaped
away
at
her
approach
.
<EOS>
She
thought
nothing
of
the
evening
light
that
lay
gently
in
the
grassy
alleys
between
the
fern
,
and
made
the
beauty
of
their
living
green
more
visible
than
it
had
been
in
the
overpowering
flood
of
noon
:
she
thought
of
nothing
that
was
present
.
<EOS>
She
only
saw
something
that
was
possible
:
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
coming
to
meet
her
again
along
the
Fir
-
tree
Grove
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
foreground
of
Hetty
's
picture
;
behind
it
lay
a
bright
hazy
something
 
<EOS>
days
that
were
not
to
be
as
the
other
days
of
her
life
had
been
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
she
had
been
wooed
by
a
river
-
god
,
who
might
any
time
take
her
to
his
wondrous
halls
below
a
watery
heaven
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
what
would
come
,
since
this
strange
entrancing
delight
had
come
.
<EOS>
If
a
chest
full
of
lace
and
satin
and
jewels
had
been
sent
her
from
some
unknown
source
,
how
could
she
but
have
thought
that
her
whole
lot
was
going
to
change
,
and
that
to
-
morrow
some
still
more
bewildering
joy
would
befall
her
?
<EOS>
Hetty
had
never
read
a
novel
;
if
she
had
ever
seen
one
,
I
think
the
words
would
have
been
too
hard
for
her
;
how
then
could
she
find
a
shape
for
her
expectations
?
<EOS>
They
were
as
formless
as
the
sweet
languid
odours
of
the
garden
at
the
Chase
,
which
had
floated
past
her
as
she
walked
by
the
gate
.
  
<EOS>
She
is
at
another
gate
now
 
that
leading
into
Fir
-
tree
Grove
.
<EOS>
She
enters
the
wood
,
where
it
is
already
twilight
,
and
at
every
step
she
takes
,
the
fear
at
her
heart
becomes
colder
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
not
come
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
dreary
it
was
 
the
thought
of
going
out
at
the
other
end
of
the
wood
,
into
the
unsheltered
road
,
without
having
seen
him
.
<EOS>
She
reaches
the
first
turning
towards
the
Hermitage
,
walking
slowly
 
<EOS>
he
is
not
there
.
<EOS>
She
hates
the
leveret
that
runs
across
the
path
;
she
hates
everything
that
is
not
what
she
longs
for
.
<EOS>
She
walks
on
,
happy
whenever
she
is
coming
to
a
bend
in
the
road
,
for
perhaps
he
is
behind
it
.
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
She
is
beginning
to
cry
<EOS>
:
her
heart
has
swelled
so
,
the
tears
stand
in
her
eyes
;
she
gives
one
great
sob
,
while
the
corners
of
her
mouth
quiver
,
and
the
tears
roll
down
.
  
<EOS>
She
does
n't
know
that
there
is
another
turning
to
the
Hermitage
,
that
she
is
close
against
it
,
and
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
is
only
a
few
yards
from
her
,
full
of
one
thought
,
and
a
thought
of
which
she
only
is
the
object
.
<EOS>
He
is
going
to
see
Hetty
again
:
that
is
the
longing
which
has
been
growing
through
the
last
three
hours
to
a
feverish
thirst
.
<EOS>
Not
,
of
course
,
to
speak
in
the
caressing
way
into
which
he
had
unguardedly
fallen
before
dinner
,
but
to
set
things
right
with
her
by
a
kindness
which
would
have
the
air
of
friendly
civility
,
and
prevent
her
from
running
away
with
wrong
notions
about
their
mutual
relation
.
  
<EOS>
If
Hetty
had
known
he
was
there
,
she
would
not
have
cried
;
and
it
would
have
been
better
,
for
then
Arthur
would
perhaps
have
behaved
as
wisely
as
he
had
intended
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
started
when
he
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
side
-
alley
,
and
looked
up
at
him
with
two
great
drops
rolling
down
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
What
else
could
he
do
but
speak
to
her
in
a
soft
,
soothing
tone
,
as
if
she
were
a
bright
-
eyed
spaniel
with
a
thorn
in
her
foot
?
  
<EOS>
"
Has
something
frightened
you
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
anything
in
the
wood
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
frightened
 
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
of
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
blushing
so
<EOS>
,
she
did
n't
know
whether
she
was
happy
or
miserable
.
<EOS>
To
be
crying
again
 
what
did
gentlemen
think
of
girls
who
cried
in
that
way
?
<EOS>
She
felt
unable
even
to
say
"
no
,
"
but
could
only
look
away
from
him
and
wipe
the
tears
from
her
cheek
.
<EOS>
Not
before
a
great
drop
had
fallen
on
her
rose
-
coloured
strings
 
<EOS>
she
knew
that
quite
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
be
cheerful
again
.
<EOS>
Smile
at
me
,
and
tell
me
what
's
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Come
,
tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
turned
her
head
towards
him
,
whispered
,
"
I
thought
you
would
n't
come
,
"
and
slowly
got
courage
to
lift
her
eyes
to
him
.
<EOS>
That
look
was
too
much
:
he
must
have
had
eyes
of
Egyptian
granite
not
to
look
too
lovingly
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
little
frightened
bird
!
<EOS>
Little
tearful
rose
!
<EOS>
Silly
pet
!
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
cry
again
,
now
I
'm
with
you
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
he
does
n't
know
in
the
least
what
he
is
saying
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
what
he
meant
to
say
.
<EOS>
His
arm
is
stealing
round
the
waist
again
;
it
is
tightening
its
clasp
;
he
is
bending
his
face
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
round
cheek
;
his
lips
are
meeting
those
pouting
child
-
lips
,
and
for
a
long
moment
time
has
vanished
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
shepherd
in
Arcadia
for
aught
<EOS>
he
knows
,
he
may
be
the
first
youth
kissing
the
first
maiden
,
he
may
be
Eros
himself
,
sipping
the
lips
of
Psyche
 
<EOS>
it
is
all
one
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
speaking
for
minutes
after
.
<EOS>
They
walked
along
with
beating
hearts
till
they
came
within
sight
of
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
Then
they
looked
at
each
other
,
not
quite
as
they
had
looked
before
,
for
in
their
eyes
there
was
the
memory
of
a
kiss
.
  
<EOS>
But
already
something
bitter
had
begun
to
mingle
itself
with
the
fountain
of
sweets
:
already
Arthur
was
uncomfortable
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
arm
from
Hetty
's
waist
,
and
said
,
"
Here
we
are
,
almost
at
the
end
of
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
late
it
is
,
"
he
added
,
pulling
out
his
watch
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Twenty
minutes
past
eight
 
<EOS>
but
my
watch
is
too
fast
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
'd
better
not
go
any
further
now
.
<EOS>
Trot
along
quickly
with
your
little
feet
,
and
get
home
safely
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
,
and
looked
at
her
half
-
sadly
,
half
with
a
constrained
smile
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
eyes
seemed
to
beseech
him
not
to
go
away
yet
;
but
he
patted
her
cheek
and
said
"
Good
-
bye
"
again
.
<EOS>
She
was
obliged
to
turn
away
from
him
and
go
on
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Arthur
,
he
rushed
back
through
the
wood
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
put
a
wide
space
between
himself
and
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
go
to
the
Hermitage
again
;
he
remembered
how
he
had
debated
with
himself
there
before
dinner
,
and
it
had
all
come
to
nothing
 
worse
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
walked
right
on
into
the
Chase
,
glad
to
get
out
of
the
Grove
,
which
surely
was
haunted
by
his
evil
genius
.
<EOS>
Those
beeches
and
smooth
limes
 
<EOS>
there
was
something
enervating
in
the
very
sight
of
them
;
but
the
strong
knotted
old
oaks
had
no
bending
languor
in
them
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
them
would
give
a
man
some
energy
.
<EOS>
Arthur
lost
himself
among
the
narrow
openings
in
the
fern
,
winding
about
without
seeking
any
issue
,
till
the
twilight
deepened
almost
to
night
under
the
great
boughs
,
and
the
hare
looked
black
as
it
darted
across
his
path
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
feeling
much
more
strongly
than
he
had
done
in
the
morning
:
it
was
as
if
his
horse
had
wheeled
round
from
a
leap
and
dared
to
dispute
his
mastery
.
<EOS>
He
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
,
irritated
,
mortified
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
fixed
his
mind
on
the
probable
consequences
of
giving
way
to
the
emotions
which
had
stolen
over
him
to
-
day
 
of
continuing
to
notice
Hetty
,
of
allowing
himself
any
opportunity
for
such
slight
caresses
as
he
had
been
betrayed
into
already
 
than
he
refused
to
believe
such
a
future
possible
for
himself
.
<EOS>
To
flirt
with
Hetty
was
a
very
different
affair
from
flirting
with
a
pretty
girl
of
his
own
station
<EOS>
:
that
was
understood
to
be
an
amusement
on
both
sides
,
or
,
if
it
became
serious
,
there
was
no
obstacle
to
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
this
little
thing
would
be
spoken
ill
of
directly
,
if
she
happened
to
be
seen
walking
with
him
;
and
then
those
excellent
people
,
the
Poysers
,
to
whom
a
good
name
was
as
precious
as
if
they
had
the
best
blood
in
the
land
in
their
veins
 
<EOS>
he
should
hate
himself
if
he
made
a
scandal
of
that
sort
,
on
the
estate
that
was
to
be
his
own
some
day
,
and
among
tenants
by
whom
he
liked
,
above
all
,
to
be
respected
.
<EOS>
He
could
no
more
believe
that
he
should
so
fall
in
his
own
esteem
than
that
he
should
break
both
his
legs
and
go
on
crutches
all
the
rest
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
imagine
himself
in
that
position
;
it
was
too
odious
,
too
unlike
him
.
  
<EOS>
And
even
if
no
one
knew
anything
about
it
,
they
might
get
too
fond
of
each
other
,
and
then
there
could
be
nothing
but
the
misery
of
parting
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
No
gentleman
,
out
of
a
ballad
,
could
marry
a
farmer
's
niece
.
<EOS>
There
must
be
an
end
to
the
whole
thing
at
once
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
foolish
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
he
had
been
so
determined
this
morning
,
before
he
went
to
Gawaine
's
;
and
while
he
was
there
something
had
taken
hold
of
him
and
made
him
gallop
back
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
he
could
n't
quite
depend
on
his
own
resolution
,
as
he
had
thought
he
could
;
he
almost
wished
his
arm
would
get
painful
again
,
and
then
he
should
think
of
nothing
but
the
comfort
it
would
be
to
get
rid
of
the
pain
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
knowing
what
impulse
might
seize
him
to
-
morrow
,
in
this
confounded
place
,
where
there
was
nothing
to
occupy
him
imperiously
through
the
livelong
day
.
<EOS>
What
could
he
do
to
secure
himself
from
any
more
of
this
folly
?
  
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
resource
.
<EOS>
He
would
go
and
tell
Irwine
 
tell
him
everything
.
<EOS>
The
mere
act
of
telling
it
would
make
it
seem
trivial
;
the
temptation
would
vanish
,
as
the
charm
of
fond
words
vanishes
when
one
repeats
them
to
the
indifferent
.
<EOS>
In
every
way
it
would
help
him
to
tell
Irwine
.
<EOS>
He
would
ride
to
Broxton
Rectory
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
had
no
sooner
come
to
this
determination
than
he
began
to
think
which
of
the
paths
would
lead
him
home
,
and
made
as
short
a
walk
thither
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
he
should
sleep
now
:
he
had
had
enough
to
tire
him
,
and
there
was
no
more
need
for
him
to
think
.

The
Return

Home
  
<EOS>
WHILE
that
parting
in
the
wood
was
happening
,
there
was
a
parting
in
the
cottage
too
,
and
Lisbeth
had
stood
with
Adam
at
the
door
,
straining
her
aged
eyes
to
get
the
last
glimpse
of
Seth
and
Dinah
,
as
they
mounted
the
opposite
slope
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
I
'm
loath
to
see
the
last
on
her
,
"
she
said
to
Adam
,
as
they
turned
into
the
house
again
.
<EOS>
"

laughing
,
"
the

It

But

<EOS>
To
the
feminine
mind
in
some
of
its
moods
,
all
things
that
might
be
receive
a
temporary
charm
from
comparison
with
what
is
;
and
since
Adam
did
not
want
to
marry
Dinah
himself
,
Lisbeth
felt
rather
peevish
on
that
score
 
as
peevish
as
she
would
have
been
if
he
HAD
wanted
to
marry
her
,
and
so
shut
himself
out
from
Mary
Burge
and
the
partnership
as
effectually
as
by
marrying
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
half
-
past
eight
when
Adam
and
his
mother
were
talking
in
this
way
,
so
that
when
,
about
ten
minutes
later
,
Hetty
reached
the
turning
of
the
lane
that
led
to
the
farmyard
gate
,
she
saw
Dinah
and
Seth
approaching
it
from
the
opposite
direction
,
and
waited
for
them
to
come
up
to
her
.
<EOS>
They
,
too
,
like
Hetty
,
had
lingered
a
little
in
their
walk
,
for
Dinah
was
trying
to
speak
words
of
comfort
and
strength
to
Seth
in
these
parting
moments
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
saw
Hetty
,
they
paused
and
shook
hands
;
Seth
turned
homewards
,
and
Dinah
came
on
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seth
Bede
would
have
come
and
spoken
to
you
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
reached
Hetty
,
"
but
he
's
very
full
of
trouble
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
answered
with
a
dimpled
smile
,
as
if
she
did
not
quite
know
what
had
been
said
;
and
it
made
a
strange
contrast
to
see
that
sparkling
self
-
engrossed
loveliness
looked
at
by
Dinah
's
calm
pitying
face
,
with
its
open
glance
which
told
that
her
heart
lived
in
no
cherished
secrets
of
its
own
,
but
in
feelings
which
it
longed
to
share
with
all
the
world
.
<EOS>
Hetty
liked
Dinah
as
well
as
she
had
ever
liked
any
woman
;
how
was
it
possible
to
feel
otherwise
towards
one
who
always
put
in
a
kind
word
for
her
when
her
aunt
was
finding
fault
,
and
who
was
always
ready
to
take
Totty
off
her
hands
 
little
tiresome
Totty
,
that
was
made
such
a
pet
of
by
every
one
,
and
that
Hetty
could
see
no
interest
in
at
all
?
<EOS>
Dinah
had
never
said
anything
disapproving
or
reproachful
to
Hetty
during
her
whole
visit
to
the
Hall
Farm
;
she
had
talked
to
her
a
great
deal
in
a
serious
way
,
but
Hetty
did
n't
mind
that
much
,
for
she
never
listened
:
whatever
Dinah
might
say
,
she
almost
always
stroked
Hetty
's
cheek
after
it
,
and
wanted
to
do
some
mending
for
her
.
<EOS>
Dinah
was
a
riddle
to
her
;
Hetty
looked
at
her
much
in
the
same
way
as
one
might
imagine
a
little
perching
bird
that
could
only
flutter
from
bough
to
bough
,
to
look
at
the
swoop
of
the
swallow
or
the
mounting
of
the
lark
;
but
she
did
not
care
to
solve
such
riddles
,
any
more
than
she
cared
to
know
what
was
meant
by
the
pictures
in
the
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
or
in
the
old
folio
Bible
that
Marty
and
Tommy
always
plagued
her
about
on
a
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
took
her
hand
now
and
drew
it
under
her
own
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
look
very
happy
to
-
night
,
dear
child
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
think
of
you
often
when
I
'm
at
Snowfield
,
and
see
your
face
before
me
as
it
is
now
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
strange
thing
 
sometimes
when
I
'm
quite
alone
,
sitting
in
my
room
with
my
eyes
closed
,
or
walking
over
the
hills
,
the
people
I
've
seen
and
known
,
if
it
's
only
been
for
a
few
days
,
are
brought
before
me
,
and
I
hear
their
voices
and
see
them
look
and
move
almost
plainer
than
I
ever
did
when
they
were
really
with
me
so
as
I
could
touch
them
.
<EOS>
And
then
my
heart
is
drawn
out
towards
them
,
and
I
feel
their
lot
as
if
it
was
my
own
,
and
I
take
comfort
in
spreading
it
before
the
Lord
and
resting
in
His
love
,
on
their
behalf
as
well
as
my
own
.
<EOS>
And
so
I
feel
sure
you
will
come
before
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
a
moment
,
but
Hetty
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
very
precious
time
to
me
,
"
Dinah
went
on
,
"
last
night
and
to
-
day
 
seeing
two
such
good
sons
as
Adam
and
Seth
Bede
.
<EOS>
They
are
so
tender
and
thoughtful
for
their
aged
mother
.
<EOS>
And
she
has
been
telling
me
what
Adam
has
done
,
for
these
many
years
,
to
help
his
father
and
his
brother
;
it
's
wonderful
what
a
spirit
of
wisdom
and
knowledge
he
has
,
and
how
he
's
ready
to
use
it
all
in
behalf
of
them
that
are
feeble
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
he
has
a
loving
spirit
too
.
<EOS>
I
've
noticed
it
often
among
my
own
people
round
Snowfield
,
that
the
strong
,
skilful
men
are
often
the
gentlest
to
the
women
and
children
;
and
it
's
pretty
to
see
'em
carrying
the
little
babies
as
if
they
were
no
heavier
than
little
birds
.
<EOS>
And
the
babies
always
seem
to
like
the
strong
arm
best
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
it
would
be
so
with
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
so
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hetty
abstractedly
,
for
her
mind
had
been
all
the
while
in
the
wood
,
and
she
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
say
what
she
was
assenting
to
.
<EOS>
Dinah
saw
she
was
not
inclined
to
talk
,
but
there
would
not
have
been
time
to
say
much
more
,
for
they
were
now
at
the
yard
-
gate
.
  
<EOS>
The
still
twilight
,
with
its
dying
western
red
and
its
few
faint
struggling
stars
,
rested
on
the
farm
-
yard
,
where
there
was
not
a
sound
to
be
heard
but
the
stamping
of
the
cart
-
horses
in
the
stable
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
twenty
minutes
after
sunset
.
<EOS>
The
fowls
were
all
gone
to
roost
,
and
the
bull
-
dog
lay
stretched
on
the
straw
outside
his
kennel
,
with
the
black
-
and
-
tan
terrier
by
his
side
,
when
the
falling
-
to
of
the
gate
disturbed
them
and
set
them
barking
,
like
good
officials
,
before
they
had
any
distinct
knowledge
of
the
reason
.
  
<EOS>
The
barking
had
its
effect
in
the
house
,
for
,
as
Dinah
and
Hetty
approached
,
the
doorway
was
filled
by
a
portly
figure
,
with
a
ruddy
black
-
eyed
face
which
bore
in
it
the
possibility
of
looking
extremely
acute
,
and
occasionally
contemptuous
,
on
market
-
days
,
but
had
now
a
predominant
after
-
supper
expression
of
hearty
good
-
nature
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
known
that
great
scholars
who
have
shown
the
most
pitiless
acerbity
in
their
criticism
of
other
men
's
scholarship
have
yet
been
of
a
relenting
and
indulgent
temper
in
private
life
;
and
I
have
heard
of
a
learned
man
meekly
rocking
the
twins
in
the
cradle
with
his
left
hand
,
while
with
his
right
he
inflicted
the
most
lacerating
sarcasms
on
an
opponent
who
had
betrayed
a
brutal
ignorance
of
Hebrew
.
<EOS>
Weaknesses
and
errors
must
be
forgiven
 
alas
!
<EOS>
they
are
not
alien
to
us
 
<EOS>
but
the
man
who
takes
the
wrong
side
on
the
momentous
subject
of
the
Hebrew
points
must
be
treated
as
the
enemy
of
his
race
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
same
sort
of
antithetic
mixture
in
Martin
Poyser
:
he
was
of
so
excellent
a
disposition
that
he
had
been
kinder
and
more
respectful
than
ever
to
his
old
father
since
he
had
made
a
deed
of
gift
of
all
his
property
,
and
no
man
judged
his
neighbours
more
charitably
on
all
personal
matters
;
but
for
a
farmer
,
like
Luke
Britton
,
for
example
,
whose
fallows
were
not
well
cleaned
,
who
did
n't
know
the
rudiments
of
hedging
and
ditching
,
and
showed
but
a
small
share
of
judgment
in
the
purchase
of
winter
stock
,
Martin
Poyser
was
as
hard
and
implacable
as
the
north
-
east
wind
.
<EOS>
Luke
Britton
could
not
make
a
remark
,
even
on
the
weather
,
but
Martin
Poyser
detected
in
it
a
taint
of
that
unsoundness
and
general
ignorance
which
was
palpable
in
all
his
farming
operations
.
<EOS>
He
hated
to
see
the
fellow
lift
the
pewter
pint
to
his
mouth
in
the
bar
of
the
Royal
George
on
market
-
day
,
and
the
mere
sight
of
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
brought
a
severe
and
critical
expression
into
his
black
eyes
,
as
different
as
possible
from
the
fatherly
glance
he
bent
on
his
two
nieces
as
they
approached
the
door
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
had
smoked
his
evening
pipe
,
and
now
held
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
as
the
only
resource
of
a
man
who
continues
to
sit
up
after
the
day
's
business
is
done
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
lasses
,
ye're
<EOS>
rather
late
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
,
when
they
reached
the
little
gate
leading
into
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
"
The
mother
's
begun
to
fidget
about
you
,
an
'
she
's
got
the
little
un
ill
.
<EOS>
An
'
how
did
you
leave
the
old
woman
Bede
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
Is
she
much
down
about
the
old
man
?
<EOS>
He
'd
been
but
a
poor
bargain
to
her
this
five
year
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
been
greatly
distressed
for
the
loss
of
him
,
"
said
Dinah
,
"
but
<EOS>
she
's
seemed
more
comforted
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Her
son
Adam
's
been
at
home
all
day
,
working
at
his
father
's
coffin
,
and
she
loves
to
have
him
at
home
.
<EOS>
She
's
been
talking
about
him
to
me
almost
all
the
day
.
<EOS>
She
has
a
loving
heart
,
though
she
's
sorely
given
to
fret
and
be
fearful
.
<EOS>
I
wish
she
had
a
surer
trust
to
comfort
her
in
her
old
age
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
's
sure
enough
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
misunderstanding
Dinah
's
wish
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
fear
but
he
'll
yield
well
<EOS>
i
'
the
threshing
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
one
<EOS>
o
'
them
as
is
all
straw
and
no
grain
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
bond
for
him
any
day
,
as
he
'll
be
a
good
son
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
Did
he
say
he
'd
be
coming
to
see
us
soon
?
<EOS>
But
come
in
,
come
in
,
"
he
added
,
making
way
for
them
;
"
I
had
n't
need
keep
y
'
out
any
longer
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tall
buildings
round
the
yard
shut
out
a
good
deal
of
the
sky
,
but
the
large
window
let
in
abundant
light
to
show
every
corner
of
the
house
-
place
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
seated
in
the
rocking
-
chair
,
which
had
been
brought
out
of
the
"
right
-
hand
parlour
,
"
was
trying
to
soothe
Totty
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
But
Totty
was
not
disposed
to
sleep
;
and
when
her
cousins
entered
,
she
raised
herself
up
and
showed
a
pair
of
flushed
cheeks
,
which
looked
fatter
than
ever
now
they
were
defined
by
the
edge
of
her
linen
night
-
cap
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
large
wicker
-
bottomed
arm
-
chair
in
the
left
-
hand
chimney
-
nook
sat
old
Martin
Poyser
,
a
hale
but
shrunken
and
bleached
image
of
his
portly
black
-
haired
son
 
his
head
hanging
forward
a
little
,
and
his
elbows
pushed
backwards
so
as
to
allow
the
whole
of
his
forearm
to
rest
on
the
arm
of
the
chair
.
<EOS>
His
blue
handkerchief
was
spread
over
his
knees
,
as
was
usual
indoors
,
when
it
was
not
hanging
over
his
head
;
and
he
sat
watching
what
went
forward
with
the
quiet
OUTWARD
glance
of
healthy
old
age
,
which
,
disengaged
from
any
interest
in
an
inward
drama
,
spies
out
pins
upon
the
floor
,
follows
one
's
minutest
motions
with
an
unexpectant
purposeless
tenacity
,
watches
the
flickering
of
the
flame
or
the
sun
-
gleams
on
the
wall
,
counts
the
quarries
on
the
floor
,
watches
even
the
hand
of
the
clock
,
and
pleases
itself
with
detecting
a
rhythm
in
the
tick
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
time
<EOS>
o
'
night
this
is
to
come
home
,
Hetty
!
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
clock
,
do
;
why
,
it
's
going
on
for
half
-
past
nine
,
and
I
've
sent
the
gells
to
bed
this
half
-
hour
,
and
late
enough
too
;
when
they
've
got
to
get
up
at
half
after
four
,
and
the
mowers
'
bottles
to
fill
,
and
the
baking
;
and
here
's
this
blessed
child
<EOS>
wi
'
the
fever
for
what
I
know
,
and
as
wakeful
as
if
it
was
dinner
-
time
,
and
nobody
to
help
me
to
give
her
the
physic
but
your
uncle
,
and
fine
work
<EOS>
there
's
been
,
and
half
of
it
spilt
on
her
night
-
gown
 
<EOS>
it
's
well
if
she
's
swallowed
more
nor
'
ull
make
her
worse
<EOS>
i'stead

better
.
<EOS>
But
folks
as
have
no
mind
to
be
o

use
<EOS>
have
allays
the
luck
to
be
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
road
when
there
's
anything
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
set
out
before
eight
,
aunt
,
"
said
Hetty
,
in
a
pettish
tone
,
with
a
slight
toss
of
her
head
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
clock
's
so
much
before
the
clock
at
the
Chase
,
there
's
no
telling
what
time
it
'll
be
when
I
get
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
You
'd
be
wanting
the
clock
set
by
gentlefolks
's
time
,
would
you
?
<EOS>
An
'
sit
up
burnin
'

<EOS>
wi

the

'
you

<EOS>
i

the

<EOS>
The
clock
has
n't
been
put
forrard
for
the
first
time
to
-
day
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
fact
was
,
Hetty
had
really
forgotten
the
difference
of
the
clocks
when
she
told
Captain
Donnithorne
that
she
set
out
at
eight
,
and
this
,
with
her
lingering
pace
,
had
made
her
nearly
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
.
<EOS>
But
here
her
aunt
's
attention
was
diverted
from
this
tender
subject
by
Totty
,
who
,
perceiving
at
length
that
the
arrival
of
her
cousins
was
not
likely
to
bring
anything
satisfactory
to
her
in
particular
,
began
to
cry
,
"
Munny
,
munny
,
"
in
an
explosive
manner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
my
pet
,
Mother
's
got
her
,
Mother
wo
n't
leave
her
;
Totty
be
a
good
dilling
,
and
go
to
sleep
now
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
leaning
back
and
rocking
the
chair
,
while
she
tried
to
make
Totty
nestle
against
her
.
<EOS>
But
Totty
only
cried
louder
,
and
said
,
"
Do
n't
yock
!
"
<EOS>
So
the
mother
,
with
that
wondrous
patience
which
love
gives
to
the
quickest
temperament
,
sat
up
again
,
and
pressed
her
cheek
against
the
linen
night
-
cap
and
kissed
it
,
and
forgot
to
scold
Hetty
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Hetty
,
"
said
Martin
Poyser
,
in
a
conciliatory
tone
,
"
go
and
get
your
supper
<EOS>
i
'
the
pantry
,
as
the
things
are
all
put
away

then
you
can
come

take
the
little
un

your
aunt
undresses
herself
,
for
she
wo

lie
down
in
bed
without
her
mother

<EOS>
An
'
I
reckon
YOU
could
eat
a
bit
,
Dinah
,
for
they
do
n't
keep
much
of
a
house
down
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
Uncle
,
"
said
Dinah
;
"
I
ate
a
good
meal
before
I
came
away
,
for
Mrs.
Bede
would
make
a
kettle
-
cake
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
any
supper
,
"
said
Hetty
,
taking
off
her
hat
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
hold
Totty
now
,
if
Aunt
wants
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
nonsense
that
is
to
talk
!
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
you
can
live
wi'out
eatin

,
an
'
nourish
your

red

<EOS>
Go
an

get
your
supper
this
minute

child

there
's
a
nice
bit
o
'
cold
pudding
<EOS>
i
'
the
safe
 
<EOS>
just
what
you
're
fond
of
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
complied
silently
by
going
towards
the
pantry
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
went
on
speaking
to
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
,
my
dear
,
an
'
look
as
if
you
knowed
what
it
was
to
make
yourself
a
bit
comfortable
<EOS>
i
'
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
the
old
woman
was
glad
to
see
you
,
since
you
stayed
so
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
seemed
to
like
having
me
there
at
last
;
but
her
sons
say
she
does
n't
like
young
women
about
her
commonly
;
and
I
thought
just
at
first
she
was
almost
angry
with
me
for
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
it
's
a
poor
look
-
out
when
th
'
ould
<EOS>
folks
doesna
like
the
young
uns
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
bending
his
head
down
lower
,
and
seeming
to
trace
the
pattern
of
the
quarries
with
his
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
it
's
ill
livin
'
in
a
hen
-
roost
for
them
as
does
n't
like
fleas
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
all
had
our
turn
at
<EOS>
bein
'
young
,
I
reckon
,
be't
good
luck
or
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
must
learn
to
'
commodate
herself
to
young
women
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
for
it
is
n't
to
be
counted
on
as
Adam

Seth

<EOS>
ull

a

but
they
may
wait
o'er
long

<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
;
"
if
you
go
past
your
dinner
-
time
,
there
'll
be
little
relish

You

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
now
came
back
from
the
pantry
and
said
,
"
I
can
take
Totty
now
,
Aunt
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
Rachel
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
as
his
wife
seemed
to
hesitate
,
seeing
that
Totty
was
at
last
nestling
quietly
,
"
thee'dst
better
let
Hetty
carry
her
upstairs
,
while
thee
tak'st
<EOS>
thy
things
off
.
<EOS>
Thee't
<EOS>
tired

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
Thee't

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
she
may
hold
her
if
the
child
'
ull
go
to
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
went
close
to
the
rocking
-
chair
,
and
stood
without
her
usual
smile
,
and
without
any
attempt
to
entice
Totty
,
simply
waiting
for
her
aunt
to
give
the
child
into
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wilt
go
to
Cousin
Hetty
,
my
dilling
,
while
mother
gets
ready
to
go
to
bed
?
<EOS>
Then
Totty
shall
go
into
Mother
's
bed
,
and
sleep
there
all
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
her
mother
had
done
speaking
,
Totty
had
given
her
answer
in
an
unmistakable
manner
,
by
knitting
her
brow
,
setting
her
tiny
teeth
against
her
underlip
,
and
leaning
forward
to
slap
Hetty
on
the
arm
with
her
utmost
force
.
<EOS>
Then
,
without
speaking
,
she
nestled
to
her
mother
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hey
,
hey
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
while
Hetty
stood
without
moving
,
"
not
go
to
Cousin
Hetty
?
<EOS>
That
's
like
a
babby
.
<EOS>
Totty
's
a
little
woman
,
an
'
not
a
babby
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
trying
to
persuade
her
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
She
allays
takes
against
Hetty
when
she
is
n't
well
.
<EOS>
Happen
she
'll
go
to
Dinah
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
,
having
taken
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
,
had
hitherto
kept
quietly
seated
in
the
background
,
not
liking
to
thrust
herself
between
Hetty
and
what
was
considered
Hetty
's
proper
work
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
came
forward
,
and
,
putting
out
her
arms
,
said
,
"
Come
Totty
,
come
and
let
Dinah
carry
her
upstairs
along
with
Mother
:
poor
,
poor
Mother
!
<EOS>
she
's
so
tired
 
<EOS>
she
wants
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Totty
turned
her
face
towards
Dinah
,
and
looked
at
her
an
instant
,
then
lifted
herself
up
,
put
out
her
little
arms
,
and
let
Dinah
lift
her
from
her
mother
's
lap
.
<EOS>
Hetty
turned
away
without
any
sign
of
ill
humour
,
and
,
taking
her
hat
from
the
table
,
stood
waiting
with
an
air
of
indifference
,
to
see
if
she
should
be
told
to
do
anything
else
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
make
the
door
fast
now
,
Poyser
;
Alick
's
been
come
in
this
long
while
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
rising
with
an
appearance
of
relief
from
her
low
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Get
me
the
matches
down
,
Hetty
,

I

<EOS>
Come

"
  
<EOS>
The
heavy
wooden
bolts
began
to
roll
in
the
house
doors
,
and
old
Martin
prepared
to
move
,
by
gathering
up
his
blue
handkerchief
,
and
reaching
his
bright
knobbed
walnut
-
tree
stick
from
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
then
led
the
way
out
of
the
kitchen
,
followed
by
the
grandfather
,
and
Dinah
with
Totty
in
her
arms
 
all
going
to
bed
by
twilight
,
like
the
birds
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
on
her
way
,
peeped
into
the
room
where
her
two
boys
lay
;
just
to
see
their
ruddy
round
cheeks
on
the
pillow
,
and
to
hear
for
a
moment
their
light
regular
breathing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Hetty
,
get
to
bed
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
in
a
soothing
tone
,
as
he
himself
turned
to
go
upstairs
.
<EOS>
"
You
didna
mean
to
be
late
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
but
your
aunt
's
been
worrited
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
my
wench
,
good
-
night
.

"
    
<EOS>
The
Two
Bed
-
Chambers
  
HETTY
and
Dinah
both
slept
in
the
second
story
,
in
rooms
adjoining
each
other
,
meagrely
furnished
rooms
,
with
no
blinds
to
shut
out
the
light
,
which
was
now
beginning
to
gather
new
strength
from
the
rising
of
the
moon
 
more
than
enough
strength
to
enable
Hetty
to
move
about
and
undress
with
perfect
comfort
.
<EOS>
She
could
see
quite
well
the
pegs
in
the
old
painted
linen
-
press
on
which
she
hung
her
hat
and
gown
;
she
could
see
the
head
of
every
pin
on
her
red
cloth
pin
-
cushion
;
she
could
see
a
reflection
of
herself
in
the
old
-
fashioned
looking
-
glass
,
quite
as
distinct
as
was
needful
,
considering
that
she
had
only
to
brush
her
hair
and
put
on
her
night
-
cap
.
<EOS>
A
queer
old
looking
-
glass
!
<EOS>
Hetty
got
into
an
ill
temper
with
it
almost
every
time
she
dressed
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
considered
a
handsome
glass
in
its
day
,
and
had
probably
been
bought
into
the
Poyser
family
a
quarter
of
a
century
before
,
at
a
sale
of
genteel
household
furniture
.
<EOS>
Even
now
an
auctioneer
could
say
something
for
it
:
it
had
a
great
deal
of
tarnished
gilding
about
it
;
it
had
a
firm
mahogany
base
,
well
supplied
with
drawers
,
which
opened
with
a
decided
jerk
and
sent
the
contents
leaping
out
from
the
farthest
corners
,
without
giving
you
the
trouble
of
reaching
them
;
above
all
,
it
had
a
brass
candle
-
socket
on
each
side
,
which
would
give
it
an
aristocratic
air
to
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
objected
to
it
because
it
had
numerous
dim
blotches
sprinkled
over
the
mirror
,
which
no
rubbing
would
remove
,
and
because
,
instead
of
swinging
backwards
and
forwards
,
it
was
fixed
in
an
upright
position
,
so
that
she
could
only
get
one
good
view
of
her
head
and
neck
,
and
that
was
to
be
had
only
by
sitting
down
on
a
low
chair
before
her
dressing
-
table
.
<EOS>
And
the
dressing
-
table
was
no
dressing
-
table
at
all
,
but
a
small
old
chest
of
drawers
,
the
most
awkward
thing
in
the
world
to
sit
down
before
,
for
<EOS>
the
big
brass
handles
quite
hurt
her
knees
,
and
she
could
n't
get
near
the
glass
at
all
comfortably
.
<EOS>
But
devout
worshippers
never
allow
inconveniences
to
prevent
them
from
performing
their
religious
rites
,
and
Hetty
this
evening
was
more
bent
on
her
peculiar
form
of
worship
than
usual
.
  
<EOS>
Having
taken
off
her
gown
and
white
kerchief
,
she
drew
a
key
from
the
large
pocket
that
hung
outside
her
petticoat
,
and
,
unlocking
one
of
the
lower
drawers
in
the
chest
,
reached
from
it
two
short
bits
of
wax
candle
 
secretly
bought
at
Treddleston
 
and
stuck
them
in
the
two
brass
sockets
.
<EOS>
Then
she
drew
forth
a
bundle
of
matches
and
lighted
the
candles
;
and
last
of
all
,
a
small
red
-
framed
shilling
looking
-
glass
,
without
blotches
.
<EOS>
It
was
into
this
small
glass
that
she
chose
to
look
first
after
seating
herself
.
<EOS>
She
looked
into
it
,
smiling
and
turning
her
head
on
one
side
,
for
a
minute
,
then
laid
it
down
and
took
out
her
brush
and
comb
from
an
upper
drawer
.
<EOS>
She
was
going
to
let
down
her
hair
,
and
make
herself
look
like
that
picture
of
a
lady
in
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
's
dressing
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
done
,
and
the
dark
hyacinthine
curves
fell
on
her
neck
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
heavy
,
massive
,
merely
rippling
hair
,
but
soft
and
silken
,
running
at
every
opportunity
into
delicate
rings
.
<EOS>
But
she
pushed
it
all
backward
to
look
like
the
picture
,
and
form
a
dark
curtain
,
throwing
into
relief
her
round
white
neck
.
<EOS>
Then
she
put
down
her
brush
and
comb
and
looked
at
herself
,
folding
her
arms
before
her
,
still
like
the
picture
.
<EOS>
Even
the
old
mottled
glass
could
n't
help
sending
back
a
lovely
image
,
none
the
less
lovely
because
Hetty
's
stays
were
not
of
white
satin
 
<EOS>
such
as
I
feel
sure
heroines
must
generally
wear
 
<EOS>
but
of
a
dark
greenish
cotton
texture
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
yes
!
<EOS>
She
was
very
pretty
.
<EOS>
Captain
Donnithorne
thought
so
.
<EOS>
Prettier
than
anybody
about
Hayslope
 
prettier
than
any
of
the
ladies
she
had
ever
seen
visiting
at
the
Chase
 
<EOS>
indeed
it
seemed
fine
ladies
were
rather
old
and
ugly
 
and
prettier
than
Miss
Bacon
,
the
miller
's
daughter
,
who
was
called
the
beauty
of
Treddleston
.
<EOS>
And
Hetty
looked
at
herself
to
-
night
with
quite
a
different
sensation
from
what
she
had
ever
felt
before
;
there
was
an
invisible
spectator
whose
eye
rested
on
her
like
morning
on
the
flowers
.
<EOS>
His
soft
voice
was
saying
over
and
over
again
those
pretty
things
she
had
heard
in
the
wood
;
his
arm
was
round
her
,
and
the
delicate
rose
-
scent
of
his
hair
was
with
her
still
.
<EOS>
The
vainest
woman
is
never
thoroughly
conscious
of
her
own
beauty
till
she
is
loved
by
the
man
who
sets
her
own
passion
vibrating
in
return
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hetty
seemed
to
have
made
up
her
mind
that
something
was
wanting
,
for
she
got
up
and
reached
an
old
black
lace
scarf
out
of
the
linen
-
press
,
and
a
pair
of
large
ear
-
rings
out
of
the
sacred
drawer
from
which
she
had
taken
her
candles
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
old
old
scarf
,
full
of
rents
,
but
it
would
make
a
becoming
border
round
her
shoulders
,
and
set
off
the
whiteness
of
her
upper
arm
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
take
out
the
little
ear
-
rings
she
had
in
her
ears
 
<EOS>
oh
,
how
her
aunt
had
scolded
her
for
having
her
ears
bored
!
 
and
put
in
those
large
ones
.
<EOS>
They
were
but
coloured
glass
and
gilding
,
but
if
you
did
n't
know
what
they
were
made
of
,
they
looked
just
as
well
as
what
the
ladies
wore
.
<EOS>
And
so
she
sat
down
again
,
with
the
large
ear
-
rings
in
her
ears
,
and
the
black
lace
scarf
adjusted
round
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
She
looked
down
at
her
arms
:
no
arms
could
be
prettier
down
to
a
little
way
below
the
elbow
 
<EOS>
they
were
white
and
plump
,
and
dimpled
to
match
her
cheeks
;
but
towards
the
wrist
,
she
thought
with
vexation
that
they
were
coarsened
by
butter
-
making
and
other
work
that
ladies
never
did
.
  
<EOS>
Captain
Donnithorne
could
n't
like
her
to
go
on
doing
work
:
he
would
like
to
see
her
in
nice
clothes
,
and
thin
shoes
,
and
white
stockings
,
perhaps
with
silk
clocks
to
them
;
for
he
must
love
her
very
much
 
<EOS>
no
one
else
had
ever
put
his
arm
round
her
and
kissed
her
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
He
would
want
to
marry
her
and
make
a
lady
of
her
;
she
could
hardly
dare
to
shape
the
thought
 
yet
how
else
could
it
be
?
<EOS>
Marry
her
quite
secretly
,
as
Mr.
James
,
the
doctor
's
assistant
,
married
the
doctor
's
niece
,
and
nobody
ever
found
it
out
for
a
long
while
after
,
and
then
it
was
of
no
use
to
be
angry
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
had
told
her
aunt
all
about
it
in
Hetty
's
hearing
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
know
how
it
would
be
,
but
it
was
quite
plain
the
old
Squire
could
never
be
told
anything
about
it
,
for
Hetty
was
ready
to
faint
with
awe
and
fright
if
she
came
across
him
at
the
Chase
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
been
earth
-
born
,
for
what
she
knew
.
<EOS>
It
had
never
entered
her
mind
that
he
had
been
young
like
other
men
;
he
had
always
been
the
old
Squire
at
whom
everybody
was
frightened
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
was
impossible
to
think
how
it
would
be
!
<EOS>
But
Captain
Donnithorne
would
know
;
he
was
a
great
gentleman
,
and
could
have
his
way
in
everything
,
and
could
buy
everything
he
liked
.
<EOS>
And
nothing
could
be
as
it
had
been
again
:
perhaps
some
day
she
should
be
a
grand
lady
,
and
ride
in
her
coach
,
and
dress
for
dinner
in
a
brocaded
silk
,
with
feathers
in
her
hair
,
and
her
dress
sweeping
the
ground
,
like
Miss
Lydia
and
Lady
Dacey
,
when
she
saw
them
going
into
the
dining
-
room
one
evening
as
she
peeped
through
the
little
round
window
in
the
lobby
;
only
she
should
not
be
old
and
ugly
like
Miss
Lydia
,
or
all
the
same
thickness
like
Lady
Dacey
,
but
very
pretty
,
with
her
hair
done
in
a
great
many
different
ways
,
and
sometimes
in
a
pink
dress
,
and
sometimes
in
a
white
one
 
she
did
n't
know
which
she
liked
best
;
and
Mary
Burge
and
everybody
would
perhaps
see
her
going
out
in
her
carriage
 
or
rather
<EOS>
,
they
would
HEAR
of
it
:
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
these
things
happening
at
Hayslope
in
sight
of
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
At
the
thought
of
all
this
splendour
,
Hetty
got
up
from
her
chair
,
and
in
doing
so
caught
the
little
red
-
framed
glass
with
the
edge
of
her
scarf
,
so
that
it
fell
with
a
bang
on
the
floor
;
but
she
was
too
eagerly
occupied
with
her
vision
to
care
about
picking
it
up
;
and
after
a
momentary
start
,
began
to
pace
with
a
pigeon
-
like
stateliness
backwards
and
forwards
along
her
room
,
in
her
coloured
stays
and
coloured
skirt
,
and
the
old
black
lace
scarf
round
her
shoulders
,
and
the
great
glass
ear
-
rings
in
her
ears
.
  
<EOS>
How
pretty
the
little
puss
looks
in
that
odd
dress
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
easiest
folly
in
the
world
to
fall
in
love
with
her
:
there
is
such
a
sweet
babylike
roundness
about
her
face
and
figure
;
the
delicate
dark
rings
of
hair
lie
so
charmingly
about
her
ears
and
neck
;
her
great
dark
eyes
with
their
long
eye
-
lashes
touch
one
so
strangely
,
as
if
an
imprisoned
frisky
sprite
looked
out
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
,
what
a
prize
the
man
gets
who
wins
a
sweet
bride
like
Hetty
!
<EOS>
How
the
men
envy
him
who
come
to
the
wedding
breakfast
,
and
see
her
hanging
on
his
arm
in
her
white
lace
and
orange
blossoms
.
<EOS>
The
dear
,
young
,
round
,
soft
,
flexible
thing
!
<EOS>
Her
heart
must
be
just
as
soft
,
her
temper
just
as
free
from
angles
,
her
character
just
as
pliant
.
<EOS>
If
anything
ever
goes
wrong
,
it
must
be
the
husband
's
fault
there
:
he
can
make
her
what
he
likes
 
<EOS>
that
is
plain
.
<EOS>
And
the
lover
himself
thinks
so
too
:
the
little
darling
is
so
fond
of
him
,
her
little
vanities
are
so
bewitching
,
he
would
n't
consent
to
her
being
a
bit
wiser
;
those
kittenlike
glances
and
movements
are
just
what
one
wants
to
make
one
's
hearth
a
paradise
.
<EOS>
Every
man
under
such
circumstances
is
conscious
of
being
a
great
physiognomist
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
he
knows
,
has
a
language
of
her
own
,
which
she
uses
with
strict
veracity
,
and
he
considers
himself
an
adept
in
the
language
.
<EOS>
Nature
has
written
out
his
bride
's
character
for
him
in
those
exquisite
lines
of
cheek
and
lip
and
chin
,
in
those
eyelids
delicate
as
petals
,
in
those
long
lashes
curled
like
the
stamen
of
a
flower
,
in
the
dark
liquid
depths
of
those
wonderful
eyes
.
<EOS>
How
she
will
dote
on
her
children
!
<EOS>
She
is
almost
a
child
herself
,
and
the
little
pink
round
things
will
hang
about
her
like
florets
round
the
central
flower
;
and
the
husband
will
look
on
,
smiling
benignly
,
able
,
whenever
he
chooses
,
to
withdraw
into
the
sanctuary
of
his
wisdom
,
towards
which
his
sweet
wife
will
look
reverently
,
and
never
lift
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
marriage
such
as
they
made
in
the
golden
age
,
when
the
men
were
all
wise
and
majestic
and
the
women
all
lovely
and
loving
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
very
much
in
this
way
that
our
friend
Adam
Bede
thought
about
Hetty
;
only
he
put
his
thoughts
into
different
words
.
<EOS>
If
ever
she
behaved
with
cold
vanity
towards
him
,
he
said
to
himself
it
is
only
because
she
does
n't
love
me
well
enough
;
and
he
was
sure
that
her
love
,
whenever
she
gave
it
,
would
be
the
most
precious
thing
a
man
could
possess
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Before
you
despise
Adam
as
deficient
in
penetration
,
pray
ask
yourself
if
you
were
ever
predisposed
to
believe
evil
of
any
pretty
woman
 
<EOS>
if
you
ever
COULD
,
without
hard
head
-
breaking
demonstration
,
believe
evil
of
the
ONE
supremely
pretty
woman
who
has
bewitched
you
.
<EOS>
No
:
people
who
love
downy
peaches
are
apt
not
to
think
of
the
stone
,
and
sometimes
jar
their
teeth
terribly
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
too
,
had
the
same
sort
of
notion
about
Hetty
,
so
far
as
he
had
thought
of
her
nature
of
all
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
she
was
a
dear
,
affectionate
,
good
little
thing
.
<EOS>
The
man
who
awakes
the
wondering
tremulous
passion
of
a
young
girl
always
thinks
her
affectionate
;
and
if
he
chances
to
look
forward
to
future
years
,
probably
imagines
himself
being
virtuously
tender
to
her
,
because
the
poor
thing
is
so
clingingly
fond
of
him
.
<EOS>
God
made
these
dear
women
so
 
<EOS>
and
it
is
a
convenient
arrangement
in
case
of
sickness
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
,
I
believe
the
wisest
of
us
must
be
beguiled
in
this
way
sometimes
,
and
must
think
both
better
and
worse
of
people
than
they
deserve
.
<EOS>
Nature
has
her
language
,
and
she
is
not
unveracious
;
but
we
do
n't
know
all
the
intricacies
of
her
syntax
just
yet
,
and
in
a
hasty
reading
we
may
happen
to
extract
the
very
opposite
of
her
real
meaning
.
<EOS>
Long
dark
eyelashes
,
now
 
what
can
be
more
exquisite
?
<EOS>
I
find
it
impossible
not
to
expect
some
depth
of
soul
behind
a
deep
grey
eye
with
a
long
dark
eyelash
,
in
spite
of
an
experience
which
has
shown
me
that
they
may
go
along
with
deceit
,
peculation
,
and
stupidity
.
<EOS>
But
if
,
in
the
reaction
of
disgust
,
I
have
betaken
myself
to
a
fishy
eye
,
there
has
been
a
surprising
similarity
of
result
.
<EOS>
One
begins
to
suspect
at
length
that
there
is
no
direct
correlation
between
eyelashes
and
morals
;
or
else
,
that
the
eyelashes
express
the
disposition
of
the
fair
one
's
grandmother
,
which
is
on
the
whole
less
important
to
us
.
  
<EOS>
No
eyelashes
could
be
more
beautiful
than
Hetty
's
;
and
now
,
while
she
walks
with
her
pigeon
-
like
stateliness
along
the
room
and
looks
down
on
her
shoulders
bordered
by
the
old
black
lace
,
the
dark
fringe
shows
to
perfection
on
her
pink
cheek
.
<EOS>
They
are
but
dim
ill
-
defined
pictures
that
her
narrow
bit
of
an
imagination
can
make
of
the
future
;
but
of
every
picture
she
is
the
central
figure
in
fine
clothes
;
Captain
Donnithorne
is
very
close
to
her
,
putting
his
arm
round
her
,
perhaps
kissing
her
,
and
everybody
else
is
admiring
and
envying
her
 
especially
Mary
Burge
,
whose
new
print
dress
looks
very
contemptible
by
the
side
of
Hetty
's
resplendent
toilette
.
<EOS>
Does
any
sweet
or
sad
memory
mingle
with
this
dream
of
the
future
 
any
loving
thought
of
her
second
parents
 
of
the
children
she
had
helped
to
tend
 
of
any
youthful
companion
,
any
pet
animal
,
any
relic
of
her
own
childhood
even
?
<EOS>
Not
one
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
plants
that
have
hardly
any
roots
:
you
may
tear
them
from
their
native
nook
of
rock
or
wall
,
and
just
lay
them
over
your
ornamental
flower
-
pot
,
and
they
blossom
none
the
worse
.
<EOS>
Hetty
could
have
cast
all
her
past
life
behind
her
and
never
cared
to
be
reminded
of
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
had
no
feeling
at
all
towards
the
old
house
,
and
did
not
like
the
Jacob
's
Ladder
and
the
long
row
of
hollyhocks
in
the
garden
better
than
other
flowers
 
perhaps
not
so
well
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
how
little
she
seemed
to
care
about
waiting
on
her
uncle
,
who
had
been
a
good
father
to
her
 
<EOS>
she
hardly
ever
remembered
to
reach
him
his
pipe
at
the
right
time
without
being
told
,
unless
a
visitor
happened
to
be
there
,
who
would
have
a
better
opportunity
of
seeing
her
as
she
walked
across
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
Hetty
did
not
understand
how
anybody
could
be
very
fond
of
middle
-
aged
people
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
those
tiresome
children
,
Marty
and
Tommy
and
Totty
,
they
had
been
the
very
nuisance
of
her
life
 
as
bad
as
buzzing
insects
that
will
come
teasing
you
on
a
hot
day
when
you
want
to
be
quiet
.
<EOS>
Marty
,
the
eldest
,
was
a
baby
when
she
first
came
to
the
farm
,
for
the
children
born
before
him
had
died
,
and
so
Hetty
had
had
them
all
three
,
one
after
the
other
,
toddling
by
her
side
in
the
meadow
,
or
playing
about
her
on
wet
days
in
the
half
-
empty
rooms
of
the
large
old
house
.
<EOS>
The
boys
were
out
of
hand
now
,
but
Totty
was
still
a
day
-
long
plague
,
worse
than
either
of
the
others
had
been
,
because
there
was
more
fuss
made
about
her
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
no
end
to
the
making
and
mending
of
clothes
.
<EOS>
Hetty
would
have
been
glad
to
hear
that
she
should
never
see
a
child
again
;
they
were
worse
than
the
nasty
little
lambs
that
the
shepherd
was
always
bringing
in
to
be
taken
special
care
of
in
lambing
time
;
for
the
lambs
WERE
got
rid
of
sooner
or
later
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
young
chickens
and
turkeys
,
Hetty
would
have
hated
the
very
word
"
hatching
,
"
if
her
aunt
had
not
bribed
her
to
attend
to
the
young
poultry
by
promising
her
the
proceeds
of
one
out
of
every
brood
.
<EOS>
The
round
downy
chicks
peeping
out
from
under
their
mother
's
wing
never
touched
Hetty
with
any
pleasure
;
that
was
not
the
sort
of
prettiness
she
cared
about
,
but
she
did
care
about
the
prettiness
of
the
new
things
she
would
buy
for
herself
at
Treddleston
Fair
with
the
money
they
fetched
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
looked
so
dimpled
,
so
charming
,
as
she
stooped
down
to
put
the
soaked
bread
under
the
hen
-
coop
,
that
you
must
have
been
a
very
acute
personage
indeed
to
suspect
her
of
that
hardness
.
<EOS>
Molly
,
the
housemaid
,
with
a
turn
-
up
nose
and
a
protuberant
jaw
,
was
really
a
tender
-
hearted
girl
,
and
,
as
Mrs.
Poyser
said
,
a
jewel
to
look
after
the
poultry
;
but
her
stolid
face
showed
nothing
of
this
maternal
delight
,
any
more
than
a
brown
earthenware
pitcher
will
show
the
light
of
the
lamp
within
it
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
generally
a
feminine
eye
that
first
detects
the
moral
deficiencies
hidden
under
the
"
dear
deceit
"
of
beauty
,
so
it
is
not
surprising
that
Mrs.
Poyser
,
with
her
keenness
and
abundant
opportunity
for
observation
,
should
have
formed
a
tolerably
fair
estimate
of
what
might
be
expected
from
Hetty
in
the
way
of
feeling
,
and
in
moments
of
indignation
she
had
sometimes
spoken
with
great
openness
on
the
subject
to
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
no
better
than
a
peacock
,
as
'
ud
strut
about
on
the
wall
and
spread
its
tail
when
the
sun
shone
if
all
the
folks
<EOS>
i
'
the
parish
was
dying
<EOS>
:
there
's
nothing
seems
to
give
her
a
turn
i
'
th
'
inside
,
not
even
when
we
thought
Totty
had
tumbled
into
the
pit
.
<EOS>
To
think
o
'
that
dear
cherub
!
<EOS>
And
we
found
her
wi
'
her
little
shoes
stuck
i
'
<EOS>
the
mud
an
'
crying
fit
to
break
her
heart
by
the
far
horse
-
pit
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
never
minded
it
<EOS>
,
I
could
see
,
though
she
's
been
at
the
nussin
'
<EOS>
o
'
the
child
ever
since
it
was
a
babby
.
<EOS>
It
's
my
belief
<EOS>
her
heart
's
as
hard
as
a
pebble
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
thee
must
n't
judge
Hetty
too
hard
.
<EOS>
Them
young
gells
are
like
the
unripe
grain
;
they
'll
make
good
meal
by
and
by
,
but
they
're
squashy
as
yet
.
<EOS>
Thee't
<EOS>
see
Hetty
'll
be
all
right
when
she
's
got
a
good
husband
and
children
of
her
own
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
want
to
be
hard
upo
'
the
gell
.
<EOS>
She
's
got
cliver
fingers
of
her
own
,
and
can
be
useful
enough
when
she
likes
<EOS>
and
I
should
miss
her
<EOS>
wi
'
the
butter
,
for
she
's
got
a
cool
hand
.
<EOS>
An
'
let
be
what
may
,
I
'd
strive
to
do
my
part
by
a
niece
o
'
<EOS>
yours
 
<EOS>
an
'
THAT
I
've
done
<EOS>
,
for
I
've
taught
her
everything
as
belongs
to
a
house
,
an
'
I
've
told
her
her
duty
often
enough
,
though
,
God
knows
,
<EOS>
I
've
no
breath
to
spare
,
an
'
that
catchin
'
pain
comes
on
dreadful
by
times
.
<EOS>
Wi
'
them
three
gells
in
the
house
<EOS>
I
'd
need
have
twice
the
strength
to
keep
'em
up
to
their
work
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
having
roast
meat
at
three
fires
;
as
soon
as
you
've
basted
one
,
another
's
burnin

"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
stood
sufficiently
in
awe
of
her
aunt
to
be
anxious
to
conceal
from
her
so
much
of
her
vanity
as
could
be
hidden
without
too
great
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
resist
spending
her
money
in
bits
of
finery
which
Mrs.
Poyser
disapproved
;
but
she
would
have
been
ready
to
die
with
shame
,
vexation
,
and
fright
if
her
aunt
had
this
moment
opened
the
door
,
and
seen
her
with
her
bits
of
candle
lighted
,
and
strutting
about
decked
in
her
scarf
and
ear
-
rings
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
such
a
surprise
,
she
always
bolted
her
door
,
and
she
had
not
forgotten
to
do
so
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
:
for
there
now
came
a
light
tap
,
and
Hetty
,
with
a
leaping
heart
,
rushed
to
blow
out
the
candles
and
throw
them
into
the
drawer
.
<EOS>
She
dared
not
stay
to
take
out
her
ear
-
rings
,
but
she
threw
off
her
scarf
,
and
let
it
fall
on
the
floor
,
before
the
light
tap
came
again
.
<EOS>
We
shall
know
how
it
was
that
the
light
tap
came
,
if
we
leave
Hetty
for
a
short
time
and
return
to
Dinah
,
at
the
moment
when
she
had
delivered
Totty
to
her
mother
's
arms
,
and
was
come
upstairs
to
her
bedroom
,
adjoining
Hetty
's
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
delighted
in
her
bedroom
window
.
<EOS>
Being
on
the
second
story
of
that
tall
house
,
it
gave
her
a
wide
view
over
the
fields
.
<EOS>
The
thickness
of
the
wall
formed
a
broad
step
about
a
yard
below
the
window
,
where
she
could
place
her
chair
.
<EOS>
And
now
the
first
thing
she
did
on
entering
her
room
was
to
seat
herself
in
this
chair
and
look
out
on
the
peaceful
fields
beyond
which
the
large
moon
was
rising
,
just
above
the
hedgerow
elms
.
<EOS>
She
liked
the
pasture
best
where
the
milch
cows
were
lying
,
and
next
to
that
the
meadow
where
the
grass
was
half
-
mown
,
and
lay
in
silvered
sweeping
lines
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
was
very
full
,
for
there
was
to
be
only
one
more
night
on
which
she
would
look
out
on
those
fields
for
a
long
time
to
come
;
but
she
thought
little
of
leaving
the
mere
scene
,
for
,
to
her
,
bleak
Snowfield
had
just
as
many
charms
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
all
the
dear
people
whom
she
had
learned
to
care
for
among
these
peaceful
fields
,
and
who
would
now
have
a
place
in
her
loving
remembrance
for
ever
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
the
struggles
and
the
weariness
that
might
lie
before
them
in
the
rest
of
their
life
's
journey
,
when
she
would
be
away
from
them
,
and
know
nothing
of
what
was
befalling
them
;
and
the
pressure
of
this
thought
soon
became
too
strong
for
her
to
enjoy
the
unresponding
stillness
of
the
moonlit
fields
.
<EOS>
She
closed
her
eyes
,
that
she
might
feel
more
intensely
the
presence
of
a
Love
and
Sympathy
deeper
and
more
tender
than
was
breathed
from
the
earth
and
sky
.
<EOS>
That
was
often
Dinah
's
mode
of
praying
in
solitude
.
<EOS>
Simply
to
close
her
eyes
and
to
feel
herself
enclosed
by
the
Divine
Presence
;
then
gradually
her
fears
,
her
yearning
anxieties
for
others
,
melted
away
like
ice
-
crystals
in
a
warm
ocean
.
<EOS>
She
had
sat
in
this
way
perfectly
still
,
with
her
hands
crossed
on
her
lap
and
the
pale
light
resting
on
her
calm
face
,
for
at
least
ten
minutes
when
she
was
startled
by
a
loud
sound
,
apparently
of
something
falling
in
Hetty
's
room
.
<EOS>
But
like
all
sounds
that
fall
on
our
ears
in
a
state
of
abstraction
,
it
had
no
distinct
character
,
but
was
simply
loud
and
startling
,
so
that
she
felt
uncertain
whether
she
had
interpreted
it
rightly
.
<EOS>
She
rose
and
listened
,
but
all
was
quiet
afterwards
,
and
she
reflected
that
Hetty
might
merely
have
knocked
something
down
in
getting
into
bed
.
<EOS>
She
began
slowly
to
undress
;
but
now
,
owing
to
the
suggestions
of
this
sound
,
her
thoughts
became
concentrated
on
Hetty
 
<EOS>
that
sweet
young
thing
,
with
life
and
all
its
trials
before
her
 
the
solemn
daily
duties
of
the
wife
and
mother
 
and
her
mind
so
unprepared
for
them
all
,
bent
merely
on
little
foolish
,
selfish
pleasures
,
like
a
child
hugging
its
toys
in
the
beginning
of
a
long
toilsome
journey
in
which
it
will
have
to
bear
hunger
and
cold
and
unsheltered
darkness
.
<EOS>
Dinah
felt
a
double
care
for
Hetty
,
because
she
shared
Seth
's
anxious
interest
in
his
brother
's
lot
,
and
she
had
not
come
to
the
conclusion
that
Hetty
did
not
love
Adam
well
enough
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
She
saw
too
clearly
the
absence
of
any
warm
,
self
-
devoting
love
in
Hetty
's
nature
to
regard
the
coldness
of
her
behaviour
towards
Adam
as
any
indication
that
he
was
not
the
man
she
would
like
to
have
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
And
this
blank
in
Hetty
's
nature
,
instead
of
exciting
Dinah
's
dislike
,
only
touched
her
with
a
deeper
pity
:
<EOS>
the
lovely
face
and
form
affected
her
as
beauty
always
affects
a
pure
and
tender
mind
,
free
from
selfish
jealousies
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
excellent
divine
gift
,
that
gave
a
deeper
pathos
to
the
need
,
the
sin
,
the
sorrow
with
which
it
was
mingled
,
as
the
canker
in
a
lily
-
white
bud
is
more
grievous
to
behold
than
in
a
common
pot
-
herb
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
Dinah
had
undressed
and
put
on
her
night
-
gown
,
this
feeling
about
Hetty
had
gathered
a
painful
intensity
;
her
imagination
had
created
a
thorny
thicket
of
sin
and
sorrow
,
in
which
she
saw
the
poor
thing
struggling
torn
and
bleeding
,
looking
with
tears
for
rescue
and
finding
none
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
way
that
Dinah
's
imagination
and
sympathy
acted
and
reacted
habitually
,
each
heightening
the
other
.
<EOS>
She
felt
a
deep
longing
to
go
now
and
pour
into
Hetty
's
ear
<EOS>
all
the
words
of
tender
warning
and
appeal
that
rushed
into
her
mind
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
Hetty
was
already
asleep
.
<EOS>
Dinah
put
her
ear
to
the
partition
and
heard
still
some
slight
noises
,
which
convinced
her
that
Hetty
was
not
yet
in
bed
.
<EOS>
Still
she
hesitated
;
she
was
not
quite
certain
of
a
divine
direction
;
the
voice
that
told
her
to
go
to
Hetty
seemed
no
stronger
than
the
other
voice
which
said
that
Hetty
was
weary
,
and
that
going
to
her
now
in
an
unseasonable
moment
would
only
tend
to
close
her
heart
more
obstinately
.
<EOS>
Dinah
was
not
satisfied
without
a
more
unmistakable
guidance
than
those
inward
voices
.
<EOS>
There
was
light
enough
for
her
,
if
she
opened
her
Bible
,
to
discern
the
text
sufficiently
to
know
what
it
would
say
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
knew
the
physiognomy
of
every
page
,
and
could
tell
on
what
book
she
opened
,
sometimes
on
what
chapter
,
without
seeing
title
or
number
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
thick
Bible
,
worn
quite
round
at
the
edges
.
<EOS>
Dinah
laid
it
sideways
on
the
window
ledge
,
where
the
light
was
strongest
,
and
then
opened
it
with
her
forefinger
.
<EOS>
The
first
words
she
looked
at
were
those
at
the
top
of
the
left
-
hand
page
:
"
And
they
all
wept
sore
,
and
fell
on
Paul
's
neck
and
kissed
him
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
enough
for
Dinah
;
she
had
opened
on
that
memorable
parting
at
Ephesus
,
when
Paul
had
felt
bound
to
open
his
heart
in
a
last
exhortation
and
warning
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
no
longer
,
but
,
opening
her
own
door
gently
,
went
and
tapped
on
Hetty
's
.
<EOS>
We
know
she
had
to
tap
twice
,
because
Hetty
had
to
put
out
her
candles
and
throw
off
her
black
lace
scarf
;
but
after
the
second
tap
the
door
was
opened
immediately
.
<EOS>
Dinah
said
,
"
Will
you
let
me
come
in
,
Hetty
?
"
and
Hetty
,
without
speaking
,
for
she
was
confused
and
vexed
,
opened
the
door
wider
and
let
her
in
.
  
<EOS>
What
a
strange
contrast
the
two
figures
made
,
visible
enough
in
that
mingled
twilight
and
moonlight
!
<EOS>
Hetty
,
her
cheeks
flushed
and
her
eyes
glistening
from
her
imaginary
drama
,
her
beautiful
neck
and
arms
bare
,
her
hair
hanging
in
a
curly
tangle
down
her
back
,
and
the
baubles
in
her
ears
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
covered
with
her
long
white
dress
,
her
pale
face
full
of
subdued
emotion
,
almost
like
a
lovely
corpse
into
which
the
soul
has
returned
charged
with
sublimer
secrets
and
a
sublimer
love
.
<EOS>
They
were
nearly
of
the
same
height
;
Dinah
evidently
a
little
the
taller
as
she
put
her
arm
round
Hetty
's
waist
and
kissed
her
forehead
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you
were
not
in
bed
,
my
dear
,
"
she
said
,
in
her
sweet
clear
voice
,
which
was
irritating
to
Hetty
,
mingling
with
her
own
peevish
vexation
like
music
with
jangling
chains
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
heard
you
moving
;
and
I
longed
to
speak
to
you
again
to
-
night
,
for
it
is
the
last
but
one
that
I
shall
be
here
,
and
we
do
n't
know
what
may
happen
to
-
morrow
to
keep
us
apart
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
sit
down
with
you
while
you
do
up
your
hair
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Hetty
,
hastily
turning
round
and
reaching
the
second
chair
in
the
room
,
glad
that
Dinah
looked
as
if
she
did
not
notice
her
ear
-
rings
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
sat
down
,
and
Hetty
began
to
brush
together
her
hair
before
twisting
it
up
,
doing
it
with
that
air
of
excessive
indifference
which
belongs
to
confused
self
-
consciousness
.
<EOS>
But
the
expression
of
Dinah
's
eyes
gradually
relieved
her
;
they
seemed
unobservant
of
all
details
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Hetty
,
"
she
said
,
"
It
has
been
borne
in
upon
my
mind
to
-
night
that
you
may
some
day
be
in
trouble
 
<EOS>
trouble
is
appointed
for
us
all
here
below
,
and
there
comes
a
time
when
we
need
more
comfort
and
help
than
the
things
of
this
life
can
give
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
tell
you
that
if
ever
you
are
in
trouble
,
and
need
a
friend
that
will
always
feel
for
you
and
love
you
,
you
have
got
that
friend
in
Dinah
Morris
at
Snowfield
,
and
if
you
come
to
her
,
or
send
for
her
,
she
'll
never
forget
this
night
and
the
words
she
is
speaking
to
you
now
.
<EOS>
Will
you
remember
it
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hetty
,
rather
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
should
you
think
I
shall
be
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
of
anything
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
had
seated
herself
as
she
tied
on
her
cap
,
and
now
Dinah
leaned
forwards
and
took
her
hands
as
she
answered
,
"
Because
,
dear
,
trouble
comes
to
us
all
in
this
life
:
we
set
our
hearts
on
things
which
it
is
n't
God
's
will
for
us
to
have
,
and
then
we
go
sorrowing
;
the
people
we
love
are
taken
from
us
,
and
we
can
joy
in
nothing
because
they
are
not
with
us
;
sickness
comes
,
and
we
faint
under
the
burden
of
our
feeble
bodies
;
we
go
astray
and
do
wrong
,
and
bring
ourselves
into
trouble
with
our
fellow
-
men
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
man
or
woman
born
into
this
world
to
whom
some
of
these
trials
do
not
fall
,
and
so
I
feel
that
some
of
them
must
happen
to
you
;
and
I
desire
for
you
,
that
while
you
are
young
you
should
seek
for
strength
from
your
Heavenly
Father
,
that
you
may
have
a
support
which
will
not
fail
you
in
the
evil
day
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
paused
and
released
Hetty
's
hands
that
she
might
not
hinder
her
.
<EOS>
Hetty
sat
quite
still
;
she
felt
no
response
within
herself
to
Dinah
's
anxious
affection
;
but
Dinah
's
words
uttered
with
solemn
pathetic
distinctness
,
affected
her
with
a
chill
fear
.
<EOS>
Her
flush
had
died
away
almost
to
paleness
;
she
had
the
timidity
of
a
luxurious
pleasure
-
seeking
nature
,
which
shrinks
from
the
hint
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Dinah
saw
the
effect
,
and
her
tender
anxious
pleading
became
the
more
earnest
,
till
Hetty
,
full
of
a
vague
fear
that
something
evil
was
some
time
to
befall
her
,
began
to
cry
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
our
habit
to
say
that
while
the
lower
nature
can
never
understand
the
higher
,
the
higher
nature
commands
a
complete
view
of
the
lower
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
the
higher
nature
has
to
learn
this
comprehension
,
as
we
learn
the
art
of
vision
,
by
a
good
deal
of
hard
experience
,
often
with
bruises
and
gashes
incurred
in
taking
things
up
by
the
wrong
end
,
and
fancying
our
space
wider
than
it
is
.
<EOS>
Dinah
had
never
seen
Hetty
affected
in
this
way
before
,
and
,
with
her
usual
benignant
hopefulness
,
she
trusted
it
was
the
stirring
of
a
divine
impulse
.
<EOS>
She
kissed
the
sobbing
thing
,
and
began
to
cry
with
her
for
grateful
joy
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
was
simply
in
that
excitable
state
of
mind
in
which
there
is
no
calculating
what
turn
<EOS>
the
feelings
may
take
from
one
moment
to
another
,
and
for
the
first
time
she
became
irritated
under
Dinah
's
caress
.
<EOS>
She
pushed
her
away
impatiently
,
and
said
,
with
a
childish
sobbing
voice
,
"
Do
n't
talk
to
me
so
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
come
to
frighten
me
?
<EOS>
I
've
never
done
anything
to
you
.
<EOS>
Why
ca
n't
you
let
me
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Dinah
felt
a
pang
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
wise
to
persist
,
and
only
said
mildly
,
"
Yes
,
my
dear
,
you
're
tired
;
I
wo
n't
hinder
you
any
longer
.
<EOS>
Make
haste
and
get
into
bed
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
went
out
of
the
room
almost
as
quietly
and
quickly
as
if
she
had
been
a
ghost
;
but
once
by
the
side
of
her
own
bed
,
she
threw
herself
on
her
knees
and
poured
out
in
deep
silence
all
the
passionate
pity
that
filled
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
As
for
Hetty
,
she
was
soon
in
the
wood
again
 
her
waking
dreams
being
merged
in
a
sleeping
life
scarcely
more
fragmentary
and
confused
.

ARTHUR
DONNITHORNE
,
you
remember
,
is
under
an
engagement
with
himself
to
go
and
see
Mr.
Irwine
this
Friday
morning
,
and
he
is
awake
and
dressing
so
early
that
he
determines
to
go
before
breakfast
,
instead
of
after
.
<EOS>
The
rector
,
he
knows
,
breakfasts
alone
at
half
-
past
nine
,
the
ladies
of
the
family
having
a
different
breakfast
-
hour
;
Arthur
will
have
an
early
ride
over
the
hill
and
breakfast
with
him
.
<EOS>
One
can
say
everything
best
over
a
meal
.
  
<EOS>
The
progress
of
civilization
has
made
a
breakfast
or
a
dinner
an
easy
and
cheerful
substitute
for
more
troublesome
and
disagreeable
ceremonies
.
<EOS>
We
take
a
less
gloomy
view
of
our
errors
now
our
father
confessor
listens
to
us
over
his
egg
and
coffee
.
<EOS>
We
are
more
distinctly
conscious
that
rude
penances
are
out
of
the
question
for
gentlemen
in
an
enlightened
age
,
and
that
mortal
sin
is
not
incompatible
with
an
appetite
for
muffins
.
<EOS>
An
assault
on
our
pockets
,
which
in
more
barbarous
times
would
have
been
made
in
the
brusque
form
of
a
pistol
-
shot
,
is
quite
a
well
-
bred
and
smiling
procedure
<EOS>
now
it
has
become
a
request
for
a
loan
thrown
in
as
an
easy
parenthesis
between
the
second
and
third
glasses
of
claret
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
there
was
this
advantage
in
the
old
rigid
forms
,
that
they
committed
you
to
the
fulfilment
of
a
resolution
by
some
outward
deed
:
<EOS>
when
you
have
put
your
mouth
to
one
end
of
a
hole
in
a
stone
wall
and
are
aware
that
there
is
an
expectant
ear
at
the
other
end
,
you
are
more
likely
to
say
what
you
came
out
with
the
intention
of
saying
than
if
you
were
seated
with
your
legs
in
an
easy
attitude
under
the
mahogany
with
a
companion
who
will
have
no
reason
to
be
surprised
if
you
have
nothing
particular
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
as
he
winds
among
the
pleasant
lanes
on
horseback
in
the
morning
sunshine
,
has
a
sincere
determination
to
open
his
heart
to
the
rector
,
and
the
swirling
sound
of
the
scythe
as
he
passes
by
the
meadow
is
all
the
pleasanter
to
him
because
of
this
honest
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
is
glad
to
see
the
promise
of
settled
weather
now
,
for
getting
in
the
hay
,
about
which
the
farmers
have
been
fearful
;
and
there
is
something
so
healthful
in
the
sharing
of
a
joy
that
is
general
and
not
merely
personal
,
that
this
thought
about
the
hay
-
harvest
reacts
on
his
state
of
mind
and
makes
his
resolution
seem
an
easier
matter
.
<EOS>
A
man
about
town
might
perhaps
consider
that
these
influences
were
not
to
be
felt
out
of
a
child
's
story
-
book
;
but
when
you
are
among
the
fields
and
hedgerows
,
it
is
impossible
to
maintain
a
consistent
superiority
to
simple
natural
pleasures
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
had
passed
the
village
of
Hayslope
and
was
approaching
the
Broxton
side
of
the
hill
,
when
,
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
he
saw
a
figure
about
a
hundred
yards
before
him
which
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
for
any
one
else
than
Adam
Bede
,
even
if
there
had
been
no
grey
,
tailless
shepherd
-
dog
at
his
heels
.
<EOS>
He
was
striding
along
at
his
usual
rapid
pace
,
and
Arthur
pushed
on
his
horse
to
overtake
him
,
for
he
retained
too
much
of
his
boyish
feeling
for
Adam
to
miss
an
opportunity
of
chatting
with
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
his
love
for
that
good
fellow
did
not
owe
some
of
its
force
to
the
love
of
patronage
:
our
friend
Arthur
liked
to
do
everything
that
was
handsome
,
and
to
have
his
handsome
deeds
recognized
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
looked
round
as
he
heard
the
quickening
clatter
of
the
horse
's
heels
,
and
waited
for
the
horseman
,
lifting
his
paper
cap
from
his
head
with
a
bright
smile
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
Next
to
his
own
brother
Seth
,
Adam
would
have
done
more
for
Arthur
Donnithorne
than
for
any
other
young
man
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
was
hardly
anything
he
would
not
rather
have
lost
than
the
two
-
feet
ruler
which
he
always
carried
in
his
pocket
;
it
was
Arthur
's
present
,
bought
with
his
pocket
-
money
when
he
was
a
fair
-
haired
lad
of
eleven
,
and
when
he
had
profited
so
well
by
Adam
's
lessons
in
carpentering
and
turning
as
to
embarrass
every
female
in
the
house
with
gifts
of
superfluous
thread
-
reels
and
round
boxes
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
quite
a
pride
in
the
little
squire
in
those
early
days
,
and
the
feeling
had
only
become
slightly
modified
as
the
fair
-
haired
lad
had
grown
into
the
whiskered
young
man
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
I
confess
,
was
very
susceptible
to
the
influence
of
rank
,
and
quite
ready
to
give
an
extra
amount
of
respect
to
every
one
who
had
more
advantages
than
himself
,
not
being
a
philosopher
or
a
proletaire
with
democratic
ideas
,
but
simply
a
stout
-
limbed
clever
carpenter
with
a
large
fund
of
reverence
in
his
nature
,
which
inclined
him
to
admit
all
established
claims
unless
he
saw
very
clear
grounds
for
questioning
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
theories
about
setting
the
world
to
rights
,
but
he
saw
there
was
a
great
deal
of
damage
done
by
building
with
ill
-
seasoned
timber
 
by
ignorant
men
in
fine
clothes
making
plans
for
outhouses
and
workshops
and
the
like
without
knowing
the
bearings
of
things
 
by
slovenly
joiners
'
work
,
and
by
hasty
contracts
that
could
never
be
fulfilled
without
ruining
somebody
;
and
he
resolved
,
for
his
part
,
to
set
his
face
against
such
doings
.
<EOS>
On
these
points
he
would
have
maintained
his
opinion
against
the
largest
landed
proprietor
in
Loamshire
or
Stonyshire
either
;
but
he
felt
that
beyond
these
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
defer
to
people
who
were
more
knowing
than
himself
.
<EOS>
He
saw
as
plainly
as
possible
how
ill
the
woods
on
the
estate
were
managed
,
and
the
shameful
state
of
the
farm
-
buildings
;
and
if
old
Squire
Donnithorne
had
asked
him
the
effect
of
this
mismanagement
,
he
would
have
spoken
his
opinion
without
flinching
,
but
the
impulse
to
a
respectful
demeanour
towards
a
"
gentleman
"
would
have
been
strong
within
him
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
The
word
"
gentleman
"
had
a
spell
for
Adam
,
and
,
as
he
often
said
,
he
"
could
n't
abide
a
fellow
who
thought
he
made
himself
fine
by
being
coxy
to
's
betters
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
remind
you
again
that
Adam
had
the
blood
of
the
peasant
in
his
veins
,
and
that
since
he
was
in
his
prime
half
a
century
ago
,
you
must
expect
some
of
his
characteristics
to
be
obsolete
.
  
<EOS>
Towards
the
young
squire
this
instinctive
reverence
of
Adam
's
was
assisted
by
boyish
memories
and
personal
regard
<EOS>
so
you
may
imagine
that
he
thought
far
more
of
Arthur
's
good
qualities
,
and
attached
far
more
value
to
very
slight
actions
of
his
,
than
if
they
had
been
the
qualities
and
actions
of
a
common
workman
like
himself
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
it
would
be
a
fine
day
for
everybody
about
Hayslope
when
the
young
squire
came
into
the
estate
 
such
a
generous
open
-
hearted
disposition
as
he
had
,
and
an
"
uncommon
"
notion
about
improvements
and
repairs
,
considering
he
was
only
just
coming
of
age
.
<EOS>
Thus
there
was
both
respect
and
affection
in
the
smile
with
which
he
raised
his
paper
cap
as
Arthur
Donnithorne
rode
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Adam
,
how
are
you
?
"
said
Arthur
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
never
shook
hands
with
any
of
the
farmers
,
and
Adam
felt
the
honour
keenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
swear
to
your
back
a
long
way
off
.
<EOS>
It
's
just
the
same
back
,
only
broader
,
as
when
you
used
to
carry
me
on
it
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
sir
,
I
remember
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
poor
look
-
out
if
folks
did
n't
remember
what
they
did
and
said
when
they
were
lads
.
<EOS>
We
should
think
no
more
about
old
friends
than
we
do
about
new
uns
,
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
going
to
Broxton
,
I
suppose
?
"
said
Arthur
,
putting
his
horse
on
at
a
slow
pace
while
Adam
walked
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
the
rectory
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
I
'm
going
to
see
about
Bradwell
's
barn
.
<EOS>
They
're
afraid
of
the
roof
pushing
the
walls
out
,
and
I
'm
going
to
see
what
can
be
done
with
it
before
we
send
the
stuff
and
the
workmen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Burge
trusts
almost
everything
to
you
now
,
Adam
,
does
n't
he
?
<EOS>
I
should
think
he
will
make
you
his
partner
soon
.
<EOS>
He
will
,
if
he
's
wise
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
see
as
he
'd
be
much
the
better
off
for
that
.
<EOS>
A
foreman
,
if
he
's
got
a
conscience
and
delights
in
his
work
,
will
do
his
business
as
well
as
if
he
was
a
partner
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
give
a
penny
for
a
man
as
'
ud
drive
a
nail
in
slack
because
he
did
n't
get
extra
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
,
Adam
;
I
know
you
work
for
him
as
well
as
if
you
were
working
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
you
would
have
more
power
than
you
have
now
,
and
could
turn
the
business
to
better
account
perhaps
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
must
give
up
his
business
sometime
,
and
he
has
no
son
;
I
suppose
he
'll
want
a
son
-
in
-
law
who
can
take
to
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
has
rather
grasping
fingers
of
his
own
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
he
wants
a
man
who
can
put
some
money
into
the
business
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
not
as
poor
as
a
rat
,
I
would
gladly
invest
some
money
in
that
way
,
for
the
sake
of
having
you
settled
on
the
estate
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
should
profit
by
it
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
I
shall
be
better
off
in
a
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
a
larger
allowance
<EOS>
now
I
'm
of
age
;
and
when
I
've
paid
off
a
debt
or
two
,
I
shall
be
able
to
look
about
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
very
good
to
say
so
,
sir
,
and
I
'm
not
unthankful
.
<EOS>
But
"
 
Adam
continued
,
in
a
decided
tone
 
<EOS>
"
I
should
n't
like
to
make
any
offers
to
Mr.
Burge
,
or
t
'
have
any
made
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
see
no
clear
road
to
a
partnership
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
ever
want
to
dispose
of
the
business
,
that
'
ud
be
a
different
matter
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
of
some
money
at
a
fair
interest
then
,
for
I
feel
sure
I
could
pay
it
off
in
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
Adam
,
"
said
Arthur
,
remembering
what
Mr.
Irwine
had
said
about
a
probable
hitch
in
the
love
-
making
between
Adam
and
Mary
Burge
,
"
we
'll
say
no
more
about
it
at
present
.
<EOS>
When
is
your
father
to
be
buried
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
Sunday
,
sir
;
Mr.
Irwine
's
coming
earlier
on
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
when
it
's
over
,
for
I
think
my
mother
'
ull
perhaps
get
easier
then
.
<EOS>
It
cuts
one
sadly
to
see
the
grief
of
old
people
;
they
've
no
way
o
'
working
it
off
,
and
the
new
spring
brings
no
new
shoots
out
on
the
withered
tree
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
've
had
a
good
deal
of
trouble
and
vexation
in
your
life
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
you
've
ever
been
hare
-
brained
and
light
-
hearted
,
like
other
youngsters
.
<EOS>
You
've
always
had
some
care
on
your
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
sir
;
but
that
's
nothing
to
make
a
fuss
about
.
<EOS>
If
we
're
men
and
have
men
's
feelings
,
I
reckon
we
must
have
men
's
troubles
.
<EOS>
We
ca
n't
be
like
the
birds
,
as
fly
from
their
nest
as
soon
as
they
've
got
their
wings
,
and
never
know
their
kin
when
they
see
'em
,
and
get
a
fresh
lot
every
year
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
enough
to
be
thankful
for
:
I
've
allays
had
health
and
strength
and
brains
to
give
me
a
delight
in
my
work
;
and
I
count
it
a
great
thing
as
I
've
had
Bartle
Massey
's
night
-
school
to
go
to
.
<EOS>
He
's
helped
me
to
knowledge
I
could
never
ha
'
got
by
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
rare
fellow
you
are
,
Adam
!
"
<EOS>
said
Arthur
,
after
a
pause
,
in
which
he
had
looked
musingly
at
the
big
fellow
walking
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
hit
out
better
than
most
men
at
Oxford
,
and
yet
I
believe
you
would
knock
me
into
next
week
if
I
were
to
have
a
battle
with
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
ever
do
that
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
looking
round
at
Arthur
and
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
used
to
fight
for
fun
,
but
I
've
never
done
that
since
I
was
the
cause
o
'
<EOS>
poor
Gil
Tranter
being
laid
up
for
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
I
'll
never
fight
any
man
again
,
only
when
he
behaves
like
a
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
If
you
get
hold
of
a
chap
that
's
got
no
shame
nor
conscience
to
stop
him
,
you
must
try
what
you
can
do
by
bunging
his
eyes
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
did
not
laugh
,
for
he
was
preoccupied
with
some
thought
that
made
him
say
presently
,
"
I
should
think
now
,
Adam
,
you
never
have
any
struggles
within
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
you
would
master
a
wish
that
you
had
made
up
your
mind
<EOS>
it
was
not
quite
right
to
indulge
,
as
easily
as
you
would
knock
down
a
drunken
fellow
who
was
quarrelsome
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
mean
,
you
are
never
shilly
-
shally
,
first
making
up
your
mind
that
you
wo
n't
do
a
thing
,
and
then
doing
it
after
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Adam
,
slowly
,
after
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
"
no
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
remember
ever
being
see
-
saw
in
that
way
,
when
I
'd
made
my
mind
up
,
as
you
say
,
that
a
thing
was
wrong
.
<EOS>
It
takes
the
taste
out
o
'
my
mouth
for
things
,
when
I
know
I
should
have
a
heavy
conscience
after
'em
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
could
cast
up
a
sum
,
as
you
can
never
do
what
's
wrong
without
breeding
sin
and
trouble
more
than
you
can
ever
see
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
a
bit
o
'
bad
workmanship
 
<EOS>
you
never
see
th
'
end
o
'
the
mischief
it
'll
do
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
poor
look
-
out
to
come
into
the
world
to
make
your
fellow
-
creatures
worse
off
instead
o
'
better
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
a
difference
between
the
things
folks
call
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
for
making
a
sin
of
every
little
fool
's
trick
,
or
bit
o
'
<EOS>
nonsense
anybody
may
be
let
into
,
like
some
o
'
them
dissenters
.
<EOS>
And
a
man
may
have
two
minds
whether
it
is
n't
worthwhile
to
get
a
bruise
or
two
for
the
sake
of
a
bit
o
'
fun
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
n't
my
way
to
be
see
-
saw
about
anything
:
I
think
my
fault
lies
th
'
other
way
.
<EOS>
When
I
've
said
a
thing
,
if
it
's
only
to
myself
,
it
's
hard
for
me
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
that
's
just
what
I
expected
of
you
,
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
got
an
iron
will
,
as
well
as
an
iron
arm
.
<EOS>
But
however
strong
a
man
's
resolution
may
be
,
it
costs
him
something
to
carry
it
out
,
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
We
may
determine
not
to
gather
any
cherries
and
keep
our
hands
sturdily
in
our
pockets
,
but
we
ca
n't
prevent
our
mouths
from
watering
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
sir
,
but
there
's
nothing
like
settling
with
ourselves
as
there
's
a
deal
we
must
do
without
i
'
this
life
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
use
looking
on
life
as
if
it
was
Treddles'on
Fair
,
where
folks
only
go
to
see
shows
and
get
fairings
.
<EOS>
If
we
do
,
we
shall
find
it
different
.
<EOS>
But
where
's
the
use
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
me
talking
to
you
,
sir
?
<EOS>
You
know
better
than
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
so
sure
of
that
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
You
've
had
four
or
five
years
of
experience
more
than
I
've
had
,
and
I
think
your
life
has
been
a
better
school
to
you
than
college
has
been
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
sir
,
you
seem
to
think
o
'
college
something
like
what
Bartle
Massey
does
.
<EOS>
He
says
college
mostly
makes
people
like
bladders
 
just
good
for
nothing
but
t
'
hold
the
stuff
as
is
poured
into
'em
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
got
a
tongue
like
a
sharp
blade
<EOS>
,
Bartle
has
 
it
never
touches
anything
<EOS>
but
it
cuts
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
turning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
must
bid
you
good
-
morning
,
as
you
're
going
to
the
rectory
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Adam
,
good
-
bye
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
gave
his
horse
to
the
groom
at
the
rectory
gate
,
and
walked
along
the
gravel
towards
the
door
which
opened
on
the
garden
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
the
rector
always
breakfasted
in
his
study
,
and
the
study
lay
on
the
left
hand
of
this
door
,
opposite
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
low
room
,
belonging
to
the
old
part
of
the
house
 
dark
with
the
sombre
covers
of
the
books
that
lined
the
walls
;
yet
it
looked
very
cheery
this
morning
as
Arthur
reached
the
open
window
.
<EOS>
For
the
morning
sun
fell
aslant
on
the
great
glass
globe
with
gold
fish
in
it
,
which
stood
on
a
scagliola
pillar
in
front
of
the
ready
-
spread
bachelor
breakfast
-
table
,
and
by
the
side
of
this
breakfast
-
table
was
a
group
which
would
have
made
any
room
enticing
.
<EOS>
In
the
crimson
damask
easy
-
chair
sat
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
that
radiant
freshness
which
he
always
had
when
he
came
from
his
morning
toilet
;
his
finely
formed
plump
white
hand
was
playing
along
Juno
's
brown
curly
back
;
and
close
to
Juno
's
tail
,
which
was
wagging
with
calm
matronly
pleasure
,
the
two
brown
pups
were
rolling
over
each
other
in
an
ecstatic
duet
of
worrying
noises
.
<EOS>
On
a
cushion
a
little
removed
sat
Pug
,
with
the
air
of
a
maiden
lady
,
who
looked
on
these
familiarities
as
animal
weaknesses
,
which
she
made
as
little
show
as
possible
of
observing
.
<EOS>
On
the
table
,
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
elbow
,
lay
the
first
volume
of
the
Foulis
AEschylus
,
which
Arthur
knew
well
by
sight
;
and
the
silver
coffee
-
pot
,
which
Carroll
was
bringing
in
,
sent
forth
a
fragrant
steam
which
completed
the
delights
of
a
bachelor
breakfast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hallo
,
Arthur
,
that
's
a
good
fellow
!
<EOS>
You
're
just
in
time
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
Arthur
paused
and
stepped
in
over
the
low
window
-
sill
.
<EOS>
"
Carroll
,
we
shall
want
more
coffee
and
eggs
,
and
have
n't
you
got
some
cold
fowl
for
us
to
eat
with
that
ham
?
<EOS>
Why
,
this
is
like
old
days
,
Arthur
;
you
have
n't
been
to
breakfast
with
me
these
five
years
.

It
was
a
tempting
morning
for
a
ride
before
breakfast
,
"
said
Arthur
;
"
and
I
used
to
like
breakfasting
with
you
<EOS>
so
when
I
was
reading
with
you
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
is
always
a
few
degrees
colder
at
breakfast
than
at
any
other
hour
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
think
his
morning
bath
does
n't
agree
with
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
was
anxious
not
to
imply
that
he
came
with
any
special
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
found
himself
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
presence
than
the
confidence
which
he
had
thought
quite
easy
before
,
suddenly
appeared
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
to
him
,
and
at
the
very
moment
of
shaking
hands
he
saw
his
purpose
in
quite
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
make
Irwine
understand
his
position
unless
he
told
him
those
little
scenes
in
the
wood
;
and
how
could
he
tell
them
without
looking
like
a
fool
?
<EOS>
And
then
his
weakness
in
coming
back
from
Gawaine
's
,
and
doing
the
very
opposite
of
what
he
intended
!
<EOS>
Irwine
would
think
him
a
shilly
-
shally
fellow
ever
after
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
must
come
out
in
an
unpremeditated
way
;
the
conversation
might
lead
up
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
breakfast
-
time
better
than
any
other
moment
in
the
day
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
No
dust
has
settled
on
one
's
mind
then
,
and
it
presents
a
clear
mirror
to
the
rays
of
things
.
<EOS>
I
always
have
a
favourite
book
by
me
at
breakfast
,
and
I
enjoy
the
bits
I
pick
up
then
so
much
,
that
regularly
every
morning
it
seems
to
me
as
if
I
should
certainly
become
studious
again
.
<EOS>
But
presently
Dent
brings
up
a
poor
fellow
who
has
killed
a
hare
,
and
when
I
've
got
through
my
"
justicing
,
"
as
Carroll
calls
it
,
I
'm
inclined
for
a
ride
round
the
glebe
,
and
on
my
way
back
I
meet
with
the
master
of
the
workhouse
,
who
has
got
a
long
story
of
a
mutinous
pauper
to
tell
me
;
and
so
the
day
goes
on
,
<EOS>
and
I
'm
always
the
same
lazy
fellow
before
evening
sets
in
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
one
wants
the
stimulus
of
sympathy
,
and
I
have
never
had
that
since
poor
D'Oyley
left
Treddleston
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
stuck
to
your
books
<EOS>
well
,
you
rascal
,
I
should
have
had
a
pleasanter
prospect
before
me
.
<EOS>
But
scholarship
does
n't
run
in
your
family
blood
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
indeed
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
if
I
can
remember
a
little
inapplicable
Latin
to
adorn
my
maiden
speech
in
Parliament
six
or
seven
years
hence
.
"
<EOS>
Cras
ingens
iterabimus
aequor
,
"
and
a
few
shreds
of
that
sort
,
will
perhaps
stick
to
me
,
and
I
shall
arrange
my
opinions
so
as
to
introduce
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
a
knowledge
of
the
classics
is
a
pressing
want
to
a
country
gentleman
;
as
far
as
I
can
see
,
he
'd
much
better
have
a
knowledge
of
manures
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
reading
your
friend
Arthur
Young
's
books
lately
,
and
there
's
nothing
I
should
like
better
than
to
carry
out
some
of
his
ideas
in
putting
the
farmers
on
a
better
management
of
their
land
;
and
,
as
he
says
,
making
what
was
a
wild
country
,
all
of
the
same
dark
hue
,
bright
and
variegated
with
corn
and
cattle
.
<EOS>
My
grandfather
will
never
let
me
have
any
power
while
he
lives
,
but
there
's
nothing
I
should
like
better
than
to
undertake
the
Stonyshire
side
of
the
estate
 
<EOS>
it
's
in
a
dismal
condition
 
and
set
improvements
on
foot
,
and
gallop
about
from
one
place
to
another
and
overlook
them
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
all
the
labourers
,
and
see
them
touching
their
hats
to
me
with
a
look
of
goodwill
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bravo
,
Arthur
!
<EOS>
A
man
who
has
no
feeling
for
the
classics
could
n't
make
a
better
apology
for
coming
into
the
world
than
by
increasing
the
quantity
of
food
to
maintain
scholars
 
and
rectors
who
appreciate
scholars
.
<EOS>
And
whenever
you
enter
on
your
career
of
model
landlord
may
I
be
there
to
see
.
<EOS>
You
'll
want
a
portly
rector
to
complete
the
picture
,
and
take
his
tithe
of
all
the
respect
and
honour
you
get
by
your
hard
work
.
<EOS>
Only
do
n't
set
your
heart
too
strongly
on
the
goodwill
you
are
to
get
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
sure
that
men
are
the
fondest
of
those
who
try
to
be
useful
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
know
Gawaine
has
got
the
curses
of
the
whole
neighbourhood
upon
him
about
that
enclosure
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
it
quite
clear
to
your
mind
which
you
are
most
bent
upon
,
old
boy
 
popularity
or
usefulness
 
else
you
may
happen
to
miss
both
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
Gawaine
is
harsh
in
his
manners
;
he
does
n't
make
himself
personally
agreeable
to
his
tenants
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
there
's
anything
you
ca
n't
prevail
on
people
to
do
with
kindness
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
could
n't
live
in
a
neighbourhood
where
I
was
not
respected
and
beloved
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
very
pleasant
to
go
among
the
tenants
here
 
<EOS>
they
seem
all
so
well
inclined
to
me
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
seems
only
the
other
day
to
them
since
I
was
a
little
lad
,
riding
on
a
pony
about
as
big
as
a
sheep
.
<EOS>
And
if
fair
allowances
were
made
to
them
,
and
their
buildings
attended
to
,
one
could
persuade
them
to
farm
on
a
better
plan
,
stupid
as
they
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
mind
you
fall
in
love
in
the
right
place
,
and
do
n't
get
a
wife
who
will
drain
your
purse
and
make
you
niggardly
in
spite
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
My
mother
and
I
have
a
little
discussion
about
you
sometimes
:
she
says
,
"
I
'll
never
risk
a
single
prophecy
on
Arthur
until
I
see
the
woman
he
falls
in
love
with
.
"
<EOS>
She
thinks
your
lady
-
love
will
rule
you
as
the
moon
rules
the
tides
.
<EOS>
But
I
feel
bound
to
stand
up
for
you
,
as
my
pupil
you
know
,
and
I
maintain
that
you
're
not
of
that
watery
quality
.
<EOS>
So
mind
you
do
n't
disgrace
my
judgment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
winced
under
this
speech
,
for
keen
old
Mrs.
Irwine
's
opinion
about
him
had
the
disagreeable
effect
of
a
sinister
omen
.
<EOS>
This
,
to
be
sure
,
was
only
another
reason
for
persevering
in
his
intention
,
and
getting
an
additional
security
against
himself
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
at
this
point
in
the
conversation
,
he
was
conscious
of
increased
disinclination
to
tell
his
story
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
an
impressible
nature
,
and
lived
a
great
deal
in
other
people
's
opinions
and
feelings
concerning
himself
;
and
the
mere
fact
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
an
intimate
friend
,
who
had
not
the
slightest
notion
that
he
had
had
any
such
serious
internal
struggle
as
he
came
to
confide
,
rather
shook
his
own
belief
in
the
seriousness
of
the
struggle
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
after
all
,
a
thing
to
make
a
fuss
about
;
and
what
could
Irwine
do
for
him
that
he
could
not
do
for
himself
?
<EOS>
He
would
go
to
Eagledale
in
spite
of
Meg
's
lameness
 
go
on
Rattler
,
and
let
Pym
follow
as
well
as
he
could
on
the
old
hack
.
<EOS>
That
was
his
thought
as
he
sugared
his
coffee
;
but
the
next
minute
,
as
he
was
lifting
the
cup
to
his
lips
,
he
remembered
how
thoroughly
he
had
made
up
his
mind
last
night
to
tell
Irwine
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
He
would
not
be
vacillating
again
 
<EOS>
he
WOULD
do
what
he
had
meant
to
do
,
this
time
.
<EOS>
So
it
would
be
well
not
to
let
the
personal
tone
of
the
conversation
altogether
drop
.
<EOS>
If
they
went
to
quite
indifferent
topics
,
his
difficulty
would
be
heightened
.
<EOS>
It
had
required
no
noticeable
pause
for
this
rush
and
rebound
of
feeling
,
before
he
answered
,
"
But
I
think
it
is
hardly
an
argument
against
a
man
's
general
strength
of
character
that
he
should
be
apt
to
be
mastered
by
love
.
<EOS>
A
fine
constitution
does
n't
insure
one
against
smallpox
or
any
other
of
those
inevitable
diseases
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
be
very
firm
in
other
matters
and
yet
be
under
a
sort
of
witchery
from
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
there
's
this
difference
between
love
and
smallpox
,
or
bewitchment
either
 
that
if
you
detect
the
disease
at
an
early
stage
and
try
change
of
air
,
there
is
every
chance
of
complete
escape
without
any
further
development
of
symptoms
.
<EOS>
And
there
are
certain
alternative
doses
which
a
man
may
administer
to
himself
by
keeping
unpleasant
consequences
before
his
mind
:
this
gives
you
a
sort
of
smoked
glass
through
which
you
may
look
at
the
resplendent
fair
one
and
discern
her
true
outline
;
though
I
'm
afraid
,
by
the
by
,
the
smoked
glass
is
apt
to
be
missing
just
at
the
moment
it
is
most
wanted
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
now
,
even
a
man
fortified
with
a
knowledge
of
the
classics
might
be
lured
into
an
imprudent
marriage
,
in
spite
of
the
warning
given
him
by
the
chorus
in
the
Prometheus
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
smile
that
flitted
across
Arthur
's
face
was
a
faint
one
,
and
instead
of
following
Mr.
Irwine
's
playful
lead
,
he
said
,
quite
seriously
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
that
's
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
desperately
vexatious
thing
,
that
after
all
one
's
reflections
and
quiet
determinations
,
we
should
be
ruled
by
moods
that
one
ca
n't
calculate
on
beforehand
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
a
man
ought
to
be
blamed
so
much
if
he
is
betrayed
into
doing
things
in
that
way
,
in
spite
of
his
resolutions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
but
the
moods
lie
in
his
nature
,
my
boy
,
just
as
much
as
his
reflections
did
,
and
more
.
<EOS>
A
man
can
never
do
anything
at
variance
with
his
own
nature
.
<EOS>
He
carries
within
him
the
germ
of
his
most
exceptional
action
;
and
<EOS>
if
we
wise
people
make
eminent
fools
of
ourselves
on
any
particular
occasion
,
we
must
endure
the
legitimate
conclusion
that
we
carry
a
few
grains
of
folly
to
our
ounce
of
wisdom
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Well
,
but
one
may
be
betrayed
into
doing
things
by
a
combination
of
circumstances
,
which
one
might
never
have
done
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
a
man
ca
n't
very
well
steal
a
bank
-
note
unless
the
bank
-
note
lies
within
convenient
reach
;
but
he
wo
n't
make
us
think
him
an
honest
man
because
he
begins
to
howl
at
the
bank
-
note
for
falling
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
surely
you
do
n't
think
a
man
who
struggles
against
a
temptation
into
which
he
falls
at
last
as
bad
as
the
man
who
never
struggles
at
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
certainly
;
I
pity
him
in
proportion
to
his
struggles
,
for
they
foreshadow
the
inward
suffering
which
is
the
worst
form
of
Nemesis
.
<EOS>
Consequences
are
unpitying
.
<EOS>
Our
deeds
carry
their
terrible
consequences
,
quite
apart
from
any
fluctuations
that
went
before
 
consequences
that
are
hardly
ever
confined
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
best
to
fix
our
minds
on
that
certainty
,
instead
of
considering
what
may
be
the
elements
of
excuse
for
us
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
knew
you
so
inclined
for
moral
discussion
,
Arthur
?
<EOS>
Is
it
some
danger
of
your
own
that
you
are
considering
in
this
philosophical
,
general
way
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
asking
this
question
,
Mr.
Irwine
pushed
his
plate
away
,
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looked
straight
at
Arthur
.
<EOS>
He
really
suspected
that
Arthur
wanted
to
tell
him
something
,
and
thought
of
smoothing
the
way
for
him
by
this
direct
question
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
Brought
suddenly
and
involuntarily
to
the
brink
of
confession
,
Arthur
shrank
back
and
felt
less
disposed
towards
it
than
ever
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
had
taken
a
more
serious
tone
than
he
had
intended
 
<EOS>
it
would
quite
mislead
Irwine
 
he
would
imagine
there
was
a
deep
passion
for
Hetty
,
while
there
was
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
He
was
conscious
of
colouring
,
and
was
annoyed
at
his
boyishness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
no
,
no
danger
,
"
he
said
as
indifferently
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
that
I
am
more
liable
to
irresolution
than
other
people
;
only
there
are
little
incidents
now
and
then
that
set
one
speculating
on
what
might
happen
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Was
there
a
motive
at
work
under
this
strange
reluctance
of
Arthur
's
which
had
a
sort
of
backstairs
influence
,
not
admitted
to
himself
?
<EOS>
Our
mental
business
is
carried
on
much
in
the
same
way
as
the
business
of
the
State
:
a
great
deal
of
hard
work
is
done
by
agents
who
are
not
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
In
a
piece
of
machinery
,
too
,
I
believe
there
is
often
a
small
unnoticeable
wheel
which
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
motion
of
the
large
obvious
ones
.
<EOS>
Possibly
there
was
some
such
unrecognized
agent
secretly
busy
in
Arthur
's
mind
at
this
moment
 
<EOS>
possibly
it
was
the
fear
lest
he
might
hereafter
find
the
fact
of
having
made
a
confession
to
the
rector
a
serious
annoyance
,
<EOS>
in
case
he
should
NOT
be
able
quite
to
carry
out
his
good
resolutions
?
<EOS>
I
dare
not
assert
that
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
The
human
soul
is
a
very
complex
thing
.
  
<EOS>
The
idea
of
Hetty
had
just
crossed
Mr.
Irwine
's
mind
as
he
looked
inquiringly
at
Arthur
,
but
his
disclaiming
indifferent
answer
confirmed
the
thought
which
had
quickly
followed
 
that
there
could
be
nothing
serious
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
probability
that
Arthur
ever
saw
her
except
at
church
,
and
at
her
own
home
under
the
eye
of
Mrs.
Poyser
;
and
the
hint
he
had
given
Arthur
about
her
the
other
day
had
no
more
serious
meaning
than
to
prevent
him
from
noticing
her
so
as
to
rouse
the
little
chit
's
vanity
,
and
in
this
way
perturb
the
rustic
drama
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Arthur
would
soon
join
his
regiment
,
and
be
far
away
:
<EOS>
no
,
there
could
be
no
danger
in
that
quarter
,
even
if
Arthur
's
character
had
not
been
a
strong
security
against
it
.
<EOS>
His
honest
,
patronizing
pride
in
the
good
-
will
and
respect
of
everybody
about
him
was
a
safeguard
even
against
foolish
romance
,
still
more
against
a
lower
kind
of
folly
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
anything
special
on
Arthur
's
mind
in
the
previous
conversation
,
it
was
clear
he
was
not
inclined
to
enter
into
details
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
was
too
delicate
to
imply
even
a
friendly
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
perceived
a
change
of
subject
would
be
welcome
,
and
said
,
"
By
the
way
,
Arthur
,
at
your
colonel
's
birthday
fete
there
were
some
transparencies
that
made
a
great
effect
in
honour
of
Britannia
,
and
Pitt
,
and
the
Loamshire
Militia
,
and
,
above
all
,
the
"
generous
youth
,
"
the
hero
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
you
should
get
up
something
of
the
same
sort
to
astonish
our
weak
minds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
opportunity
was
gone
.
<EOS>
While
Arthur
was
hesitating
,
the
rope
to
which
he
might
have
clung
had
drifted
away
 
he
must
trust
now
to
his
own
swimming
.
  
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
from
that
time
,
Mr.
Irwine
was
called
for
on
business
,
and
Arthur
,
bidding
him
good
-
bye
,
mounted
his
horse
again
with
a
sense
of
dissatisfaction
,
which
he
tried
to
quell
by
determining
to
set
off
for
Eagledale
without
an
hour
's
delay
.
      
<EOS>
In
Which
the
Story
Pauses
a
Little
  
"
THIS
Rector
of
Broxton
is
little
better
than
a
pagan
!
<EOS>
"
I
hear
one
of
my
readers
exclaim
.
<EOS>
"
How
much
more
edifying
it
would
have
been
if
you
had
made
him
give
Arthur
some
truly
spiritual
advice
!
<EOS>
You
might
have
put
into
his
mouth
the
most
beautiful
things
 
quite
as
good
as
reading
a
sermon
.
"
  
<EOS>
Certainly
I
could
,
if
I
held
it
the
highest
vocation
of
the
novelist
to
represent
things
as
they
never
have
been
and
never
will
be
.
<EOS>
Then
,
of
course
,
I
might
refashion
life
and
character
entirely
after
my
own
liking
;
I
might
select
the
most
unexceptionable
type
of
clergyman
and
put
my
own
admirable
opinions
into
his
mouth
on
all
occasions
.
<EOS>
But
it
happens
,
on
the
contrary
,
that
my
strongest
effort
is
to
avoid
any
such
arbitrary
picture
,
and
to
give
a
faithful
account
of
men
and
things
as
they
have
mirrored
themselves
in
my
mind
.
<EOS>
The
mirror
is
doubtless
defective
,
the
outlines
will
sometimes
be
disturbed
,
the
reflection
faint
or
confused
;
but
I
feel
as
much
bound
to
tell
you
as
precisely
as
I
can
what
that
reflection
is
,
as
if
I
were
in
the
witness
-
box
,
narrating
my
experience
on
oath
.
  
<EOS>
Sixty
years
ago
 
it
is
a
long
time
,
so
<EOS>
no
wonder
things
have
changed
 
all
clergymen
were
not
zealous
;
indeed
,
there
is
reason
to
believe
that
the
number
of
zealous
clergymen
was
small
,
and
it
is
probable
that
if
one
among
the
small
minority
had
owned
the
livings
of
Broxton
and
Hayslope
in
the
year
1799
,
you
would
have
liked
him
no
better
than
you
like
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
Ten
to
one
,
you
would
have
thought
him
a
tasteless
,
indiscreet
,
methodistical
man
.
<EOS>
It
is
so
very
rarely
that
facts
hit
that
nice
medium
required
by
our
own
enlightened
opinions
and
refined
taste
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
say
,
"
Do
improve
the
facts
a
little
,
then
;
make
them
more
accordant
with
those
correct
views
which
it
is
our
privilege
to
possess
.
<EOS>
The
world
is
not
just
what
we
like
;
do
touch
it
up
with
a
tasteful
pencil
,
and
make
believe
it
is
not
quite
such
a
mixed
entangled
affair
.
<EOS>
Let
all
people
who
hold
unexceptionable
opinions
act
unexceptionably
.
<EOS>
Let
your
most
faulty
characters
always
be
on
the
wrong
side
,
and
your
virtuous
ones
on
the
right
.
<EOS>
Then
we
shall
see
at
a
glance
whom
we
are
to
condemn
and
whom
we
are
to
approve
.
<EOS>
Then
we
shall
be
able
to
admire
,
without
the
slightest
disturbance
of
our
prepossessions
:
we
shall
hate
and
despise
with
that
true
ruminant
relish
which
belongs
to
undoubting
confidence
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
my
good
friend
,
what
will
you
do
then
with
your
fellow
-
parishioner
who
opposes
your
husband
in
the
vestry
?
<EOS>
With
your
newly
appointed
vicar
,
whose
style
of
preaching
you
find
painfully
below
that
of
his
regretted
predecessor
?
<EOS>
With
the
honest
servant
who
worries
your
soul
with
her
one
failing
?
<EOS>
With
your
neighbour
,
Mrs.
Green
,
who
was
really
kind
to
you
in
your
last
illness
,
but
has
said
several
ill
-
natured
things
about
you
since
your
convalescence
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
with
your
excellent
husband
himself
,
who
has
other
irritating
habits
besides
that
of
not
wiping
his
shoes
?
<EOS>
These
fellow
-
mortals
,
every
one
,
must
be
accepted
as
they
are
:
you
can
neither
straighten
their
noses
,
nor
brighten
their
wit
,
nor
rectify
their
dispositions
;
and
it
is
these
people
 
amongst
whom
your
life
is
passed
 
that
it
is
needful
you
should
tolerate
,
pity
,
and
love
<EOS>
:
it
is
these
more
or
less
ugly
,
stupid
,
inconsistent
people
whose
movements
of
goodness
you
should
be
able
to
admire
 
for
whom
you
should
cherish
all
possible
hopes
,
all
possible
patience
.
<EOS>
And
I
would
not
,
even
if
I
had
the
choice
,
be
the
clever
novelist
who
could
create
a
world
so
much
better
than
this
,
in
which
we
get
up
in
the
morning
to
do
our
daily
work
,
that
you
would
be
likely
to
turn
a
harder
,
colder
eye
on
the
dusty
streets
and
the
common
green
fields
 
on
the
real
breathing
men
and
women
,
who
can
be
chilled
by
your
indifference
or
injured
by
your
prejudice
;
who
can
be
cheered
and
helped
onward
by
your
fellow
-
feeling
,
your
forbearance
,
your
outspoken
,
brave
justice
.
  
<EOS>
So
I
am
content
to
tell
my
simple
story
,
without
trying
to
make
things
seem
better
than
they
were
;
dreading
nothing
,
indeed
,
but
falsity
,
which
,
in
spite
of
one
's
best
efforts
,
there
is
reason
to
dread
.
<EOS>
Falsehood
is
so
easy
,
truth
so
difficult
.
<EOS>
The
pencil
is
conscious
of
a
delightful
facility
in
drawing
a
griffin
 
the
longer
the
claws
,
and
the
larger
the
wings
,
the
better
;
but
that
marvellous
facility
which
we
mistook
for
genius
is
apt
to
forsake
us
when
we
want
to
draw
a
real
unexaggerated
lion
.
<EOS>
Examine
your
words
well
,
and
you
will
find
that
even
when
you
have
no
motive
to
be
false
,
it
is
a
very
hard
thing
to
say
the
exact
truth
,
even
about
your
own
immediate
feelings
 
much
harder
than
to
say
something
fine
about
them
which
is
NOT
the
exact
truth
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
for
this
rare
,
precious
quality
of
truthfulness
that
I
delight
in
many
Dutch
paintings
,
which
lofty
-
minded
people
despise
.
<EOS>
I
find
a
source
of
delicious
sympathy
in
these
faithful
pictures
of
a
monotonous
homely
existence
,
which
has
been
the
fate
of
so
many
more
among
my
fellow
-
mortals
than
a
life
of
pomp
or
of
absolute
indigence
,
of
tragic
suffering
or
of
world
-
stirring
actions
.
<EOS>
I
turn
,
without
shrinking
,
from
cloud
-
borne
angels
,
from
prophets
,
sibyls
,
and
heroic
warriors
,
to
an
old
woman
bending
over
her
flower
-
pot
,
or
eating
her
solitary
dinner
,
while
the
noonday
light
,
softened
perhaps
by
a
screen
of
leaves
,
falls
on
her
mob
-
cap
,
and
just
touches
the
rim
of
her
spinning
-
wheel
,
and
her
stone
jug
,
and
all
those
cheap
common
things
which
are
the
precious
necessaries
of
life
to
her
 
<EOS>
or
I
turn
to
that
village
wedding
,
kept
between
four
brown
walls
,
where
an
awkward
bridegroom
opens
the
dance
with
a
high
-
shouldered
,
broad
-
faced
bride
,
while
elderly
and
middle
-
aged
friends
look
on
,
with
very
irregular
noses
and
lips
,
and
probably
with
quart
-
pots
in
their
hands
,
<EOS>
but
with
an
expression
of
unmistakable
contentment
and
goodwill
.
<EOS>
"
Foh
!
"
says
my
idealistic
friend
,
"
what
vulgar
details
!
<EOS>
What
good
is
there
in
taking
all
these
pains
to
give
an
exact
likeness
of
old
women
and
clowns
?
<EOS>
What
a
low
phase
of
life
!
<EOS>
What
clumsy
,
ugly
people
!
"
  
<EOS>
But
bless
us
,
things
may
be
lovable
that
are
not
altogether
handsome
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
all
sure
that
the
majority
of
the
human
race
have
not
been
ugly
,
and
even
among
those
"
lords
of
their
kind
,
"
the
British
,
squat
figures
,
ill
-
shapen
nostrils
,
and
dingy
complexions
are
not
startling
exceptions
.
<EOS>
Yet
there
is
a
great
deal
of
family
love
amongst
us
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
friend
or
two
whose
class
of
features
is
such
that
the
Apollo
curl
on
the
summit
of
their
brows
would
be
decidedly
trying
;
yet
to
my
certain
knowledge
tender
hearts
have
beaten
for
them
,
and
their
miniatures
 
flattering
,
but
still
not
lovely
 
are
kissed
in
secret
by
motherly
lips
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
many
an
excellent
matron
,
who
could
have
never
in
her
best
days
have
been
handsome
,
and
yet
she
had
a
packet
of
yellow
love
-
letters
in
a
private
drawer
,
and
sweet
children
showered
kisses
on
her
sallow
cheeks
.
<EOS>
And
I
believe
there
have
been
plenty
of
young
heroes
,
of
middle
stature
and
feeble
beards
,
who
have
felt
quite
sure
they
could
never
love
anything
more
insignificant
than
a
Diana
,
and
yet
have
found
themselves
in
middle
life
happily
settled
with
a
wife
who
waddles
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
Thank
God
;
human
feeling
is
like
the
mighty
rivers
that
bless
the
earth
:
it
does
not
wait
for
beauty
 
<EOS>
it
flows
with
resistless
force
and
brings
beauty
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
All
honour
and
reverence
to
the
divine
beauty
of
form
!
<EOS>
Let
us
cultivate
it
to
the
utmost
in
men
,
women
,
and
children
 
in
our
gardens
and
in
our
houses
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
love
that
other
beauty
too
,
which
lies
in
no
secret
of
proportion
,
but
in
the
secret
of
deep
human
sympathy
.
<EOS>
Paint
us
an
angel
,
if
you
can
,
with
a
floating
violet
robe
,
and
a
face
paled
by
the
celestial
light
;
paint
us
yet
oftener
a
Madonna
,
turning
her
mild
face
upward
and
opening
her
arms
to
welcome
the
divine
glory
;
but
do
not
impose
on
us
any
aesthetic
rules
which
shall
banish
from
the
region
of
Art
those
old
women
scraping
carrots
with
their
work
-
worn
hands
,
those
heavy
clowns
taking
holiday
in
a
dingy
pot
-
house
,
those
rounded
backs
and
stupid
weather
-
beaten
faces
that
have
bent
over
the
spade
and
done
the
rough
work
of
the
world
 
those
homes
with
their
tin
pans
,
their
brown
pitchers
,
their
rough
curs
,
and
their
clusters
of
onions
.
<EOS>
In
this
world
there
are
so
many
of
these
common
coarse
people
,
who
have
no
picturesque
sentimental
wretchedness
!
<EOS>
It
is
so
needful
we
should
remember
their
existence
,
else
we
may
happen
to
leave
them
quite
out
of
our
religion
and
philosophy
and
frame
lofty
theories
which
only
fit
a
world
of
extremes
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
let
Art
always
remind
us
of
them
;
therefore
let
us
always
have
men
ready
to
give
the
loving
pains
of
a
life
to
the
faithful
representing
of
commonplace
things
 
men
who
see
beauty
in
these
commonplace
things
,
and
delight
in
showing
how
kindly
the
light
of
heaven
falls
on
them
.
<EOS>
There
are
few
prophets
in
the
world
;
few
sublimely
beautiful
women
;
few
heroes
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
afford
to
give
all
my
love
and
reverence
to
such
rarities
:
I
want
a
great
deal
of
those
feelings
for
my
every
-
day
fellow
-
men
,
especially
for
the
few
in
the
foreground
of
the
great
multitude
,
whose
faces
I
know
,
whose
hands
I
touch
,
for
whom
I
have
to
make
way
with
kindly
courtesy
.
<EOS>
Neither
are
picturesque
lazzaroni
or
romantic
criminals
half
so
frequent
as
your
common
labourer
,
who
gets
his
own
bread
and
eats
it
vulgarly
but
creditably
with
his
own
pocket
-
knife
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
needful
that
I
should
have
a
fibre
of
sympathy
connecting
me
with
that
vulgar
citizen
who
weighs
out
my
sugar
in
a
vilely
assorted
cravat
and
waistcoat
,
than
with
the
handsomest
rascal
in
red
scarf
and
green
feathers
 
more
needful
that
my
heart
should
swell
with
loving
admiration
at
some
trait
of
gentle
goodness
in
the
faulty
people
who
sit
at
the
same
hearth
with
me
,
or
in
the
clergyman
of
my
own
parish
,
who
is
perhaps
rather
too
corpulent
and
in
other
respects
is
not
an
Oberlin
or
a
Tillotson
,
than
at
the
deeds
of
heroes
whom
I
shall
never
know
except
by
hearsay
,
or
at
the
sublimest
abstract
of
all
clerical
graces
that
was
ever
conceived
by
an
able
novelist
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
I
come
back
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
whom
I
desire
you
to
be
in
perfect
charity
,
far
as
he
may
be
from
satisfying
your
demands
on
the
clerical
character
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
think
he
was
not
 
as
he
ought
to
have
been
 
a
living
demonstration
of
the
benefits
attached
to
a
national
church
?
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
sure
of
that
;
at
least
I
know
that
the
people
in
Broxton
and
Hayslope
would
have
been
very
sorry
to
part
with
their
clergyman
,
and
that
most
faces
brightened
at
his
approach
;
and
until
it
can
be
proved
that
hatred
is
a
better
thing
for
the
soul
than
love
,
I
must
believe
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
influence
in
his
parish
was
a
more
wholesome
one
than
that
of
the
zealous
Mr.
Ryde
,
who
came
there
twenty
years
afterwards
,
when
Mr.
Irwine
had
been
gathered
to
his
fathers
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
,
Mr.
Ryde
insisted
strongly
on
the
doctrines
of
the
Reformation
,
visited
his
flock
a
great
deal
in
their
own
homes
,
and
was
severe
in
rebuking
the
aberrations
of
the
flesh
 
<EOS>
put
a
stop
,
indeed
,
to
the
Christmas
rounds
of
the
church
singers
,
as
promoting
drunkenness
and
too
light
a
handling
of
sacred
things
.
<EOS>
But
I
gathered
from
Adam
Bede
,
to
whom
I
talked
of
these
matters
in
his
old
age
,
that
few
clergymen
could
be
less
successful
in
winning
the
hearts
of
their
parishioners
than
Mr.
Ryde
.
<EOS>
They
learned
a
great
many
notions
about
doctrine
from
him
,
so
that
almost
every
church
-
goer
under
fifty
began
to
distinguish
as
well
between
the
genuine
gospel
and
what
did
not
come
precisely
up
to
that
standard
,
as
if
he
had
been
born
and
bred
a
Dissenter
;
and
for
some
time
after
his
arrival
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
religious
movement
in
that
quiet
rural
district
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
've
seen
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
was
a
young
un
,
as
religion
's
something
else
besides
notions
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
notions
sets
people
doing
the
right
thing
 
<EOS>
it
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
same
with
the
notions
in
religion
as
it
is
with
math'matics
 
<EOS>
a
man
may
be
able
to
work
problems
straight
off
in
's
head
as
he
sits
by
the
fire
and
smokes
his
pipe
,
but
if
he
has
to
make
a
machine
or
a
building
,
he
must
have
a
will
and
a
resolution
and
love
something
else
better
than
his
own
ease
.
<EOS>
Somehow
,
the
congregation
began
to
fall
off
,
and
people
began
to
speak
light
o
'
Mr.
Ryde
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
meant
right
at
bottom
;
but
,
you
see
,
he
was
sourish
-
tempered
,
and
was
for
beating
down
prices
with
the
people
as
worked
for
him
;
and
his
preaching
would
n't
go
down
well
with
that
sauce
.
<EOS>
And
he
wanted
to
be
like
my
lord
judge
<EOS>
i
'
the
parish
,
punishing
folks
for
doing
wrong
;
and
he
scolded
'em
from
the
pulpit
as
if
he
'd
been
a
Ranter
,
and
yet
he
could
n't
abide
the
Dissenters
,
and
was
a
deal
more
set
against
'em
than
Mr.
Irwine
was
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
did
n't
keep
within
his
income
,
for
he
seemed
to
think
at
first
go
-
off
that
six
hundred
a
-
year
was
to
make
him
as
big
a
man
as
Mr.
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
sore
mischief
I
've
often
seen
with
the
poor
curates
jumping
into
a
bit
of
a
living
all
of
a
sudden
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Ryde
was
a
deal
thought
on
at
a
distance
,
I
believe
,
and
he
wrote
books
,
but
as
for
math'matics
and
the
natur
o
'
things
,
he
was
as
ignorant
as
a
woman
.
<EOS>
He
was
very
knowing
about
doctrines
,
and
used
to
call
'em
the
bulwarks
of
the
Reformation
;
but
I
've
always
mistrusted
that
sort
o
'
learning
as
leaves
folks
foolish
and
unreasonable
about
business
.
<EOS>
Now
Mester
Irwine
was
as
different
as
could
be
:
as
quick
!
 
<EOS>
he
understood
what
you
meant
in
a
minute
,
and
he
knew
all
about
building
,
and
could
see
when
you
'd
made
a
good
job
.
<EOS>
And
he
behaved
as
much
like
a
gentleman
to
the
farmers
,
and
th
'
old
women
,
and
the
labourers
,
as
he
did
to
the
gentry
.
<EOS>
You
never
saw
HIM
interfering
and
scolding
,
and
trying
to
play
th
'
emperor
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
he
was
a
fine
man
as
ever
you
set
eyes
on
;
and
so
kind
to
's
mother
and
sisters
.
<EOS>
That
poor
sickly
Miss
Anne
 
<EOS>
he
seemed
to
think
more
of
her
than
of
anybody
else
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
There
was
n't
a
soul
in
the
parish
had
a
word
to
say
against
him
;
and
his
servants
stayed
with
him
till
they
were
so
old
and
pottering
,
he
had
to
hire
other
folks
to
do
their
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
I
said
,
"
that
was
an
excellent
way
of
preaching
in
the
weekdays
;
but
I
daresay
,
if
your
old
friend
Mr.
Irwine
were
to
come
to
life
again
,
and
get
into
the
pulpit
next
Sunday
,
you
would
be
rather
ashamed
that
he
did
n't
preach
better
after
all
your
praise
of
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Adam
,
broadening
his
chest
and
throwing
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
as
if
he
were
ready
to
meet
all
inferences
,
"
nobody
has
ever
heard
me
say
Mr.
Irwine
was
much
of
a
preacher
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
go
into
deep
speritial
experience
;
and
I
know
there
s
a
deal
in
a
man
's
inward
life
as
you
ca
n't
measure
by
the
square
,
and
say
,
"
Do
this
and
that
'll
follow
,
"
and
,
"
Do
that
and
this
'll
follow
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
things
go
on
in
the
soul
,
and
times
when
feelings
come
into
you
like
a
rushing
mighty
wind
,
as
the
Scripture
says
,
and
part
your
life
in
two
a'most
,
so
you
look
back
on
yourself
as
if
you
was
somebody
else
.
<EOS>
Those
are
things
as
you
ca
n't
bottle
up
in
a
"
do
this
"
and
"
do
that
"
;
and
I
'll
go
so
far
with
the
strongest
Methodist
ever
you
'll
find
.
<EOS>
That
shows
me
there
's
deep
speritial
things
in
religion
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
make
much
out
wi
'
talking
about
it
,
but
you
feel
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
did
n't
go
into
those
things
 
<EOS>
he
preached
short
moral
sermons
,
and
that
was
all
.
<EOS>
But
then
he
acted
pretty
much
up
to
what
he
said
;
he
did
n't
set
up
for
being
so
different
from
other
folks
one
day
,
and
then
be
as
like
'em
as
two
peas
the
next
.
<EOS>
And
he
made
folks
love
him
and
respect
him
,
and
that
was
better
nor
stirring
up
their
gall
wi
'
being
overbusy
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
used
to
say
 
you
know
she
would
have
her
word
about
everything
 
<EOS>
she
said
,
Mr.
Irwine
was
like
a
good
meal
o
'
victual
<EOS>
,
you
were
the
better
for
him
without
thinking
on
it
,
and
Mr.
Ryde
was
like
a
dose
o
'
physic
,
he
gripped
you
and
worreted
you
,
and
after
all
he
left
you
much
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
did
n't
Mr.
Ryde
preach
a
great
deal
more
about
that
spiritual
part
of
religion
that
you
talk
of
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
Could
n't
you
get
more
out
of
his
sermons
than
out
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
I
knowna
.
<EOS>
He
preached
a
deal
about
doctrines
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
seen
pretty
clear
,
ever
since
I
was
a
young
un
,
as
religion
's
something
else
besides
doctrines
and
notions
.
<EOS>
I
look
at
it
as
if
the
doctrines
was
like
finding
names
for
your
feelings
,
so
as
you
can
talk
of
'em
when
you
've
never
known
'em
,
just
as
a
man
may
talk
o
'
tools
when
he
knows
their
names
,
though
he
's
never
so
much
as
seen
'em
,
still
less
handled
'em
.
<EOS>
I
've
heard
a
deal
o
'
doctrine
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
my
time
,
for
I
used
to
go
after
the
Dissenting
preachers
along
wi
'
Seth
,
when
I
was
a
lad
o
'
seventeen
,
and
got
puzzling
myself
a
deal
about
th
'
Arminians
and
the
Calvinists
.
<EOS>
The
Wesleyans
,
you
know
,
are
strong
Arminians
;
and
Seth
,
who
could
never
abide
anything
harsh
and
was
always
for
hoping
the
best
,
held
fast
by
the
Wesleyans
from
the
very
first
;
but
I
thought
I
could
pick
a
hole
or
two
in
their
notions
,
and
I
got
disputing
wi
'
one
o
'
the
class
leaders
down
at
Treddles'on
,
and
harassed
him
so
,
first
o
'
<EOS>
this
side
<EOS>
and
then
o
'
that
,
till
at
last
he
said
,
"
Young
man
,
it
's
the
devil
making
use
o
'
your
pride
and
conceit
as
a
weapon
to
war
against
the
simplicity
o
'
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
help
laughing
then
,
but
as
I
was
going
home
,
I
thought
the
man
was
n't
far
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
see
as
all
this
weighing
and
sifting
what
this
text
means
and
that
text
means
,
and
whether
folks
are
saved
all
by
God
's
grace
,
or
whether
there
goes
an
ounce
o
'
their
own
will
to't
,
was
no
part
o
'
real
religion
at
all
.
<EOS>
You
may
talk
o
'
these
things
for
hours
on
end
,
and
you
'll
only
be
all
the
more
coxy
and
conceited
for't
.
<EOS>
So
I
took
to
going
nowhere
but
to
church
,
and
hearing
nobody
but
Mr.
Irwine
,
for
he
said
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
was
good
and
what
you
'd
be
the
wiser
for
remembering
.
<EOS>
And
I
found
it
better
for
my
soul
to
be
humble
before
the
mysteries
<EOS>
o
'
God
's
dealings
,
and
not
be
making
a
clatter
about
what
I
could
never
understand
.
<EOS>
And
they
're
poor
foolish
questions
after
all
;
for
what
have
we
got
either
inside
or
outside
of
us
but
what
comes
from
God
?
<EOS>
If
we
've
got
a
resolution
to
do
right
,
He
gave
it
us
,
I
reckon
,
first
or
last
;
but
<EOS>
I
see
plain
enough
we
shall
never
do
it
without
a
resolution
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
you
perceive
,
was
a
warm
admirer
,
perhaps
a
partial
judge
,
of
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
,
happily
,
some
of
us
still
are
of
the
people
we
have
known
familiarly
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
it
will
be
despised
as
a
weakness
by
that
lofty
order
of
minds
who
pant
after
the
ideal
,
and
are
oppressed
by
a
general
sense
that
their
emotions
are
of
too
exquisite
a
character
to
find
fit
objects
among
their
everyday
fellowmen
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
been
favoured
with
the
confidence
of
these
select
natures
,
and
find
them
to
concur
in
the
experience
that
great
men
are
overestimated
and
small
men
are
insupportable
;
that
if
you
would
love
a
woman
without
ever
looking
back
on
your
love
as
a
folly
,
she
must
die
while
you
are
courting
her
;
and
if
you
would
maintain
the
slightest
belief
in
human
heroism
,
you
must
never
make
a
pilgrimage
to
see
the
hero
.
<EOS>
I
confess
I
have
often
meanly
shrunk
from
confessing
to
these
accomplished
and
acute
gentlemen
what
my
own
experience
has
been
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
have
often
smiled
with
hypocritical
assent
,
and
gratified
them
with
an
epigram
on
the
fleeting
nature
of
our
illusions
,
which
any
one
moderately
acquainted
with
French
literature
can
command
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Human
converse
,
I
think
some
wise
man
has
remarked
,
is
not
rigidly
sincere
.
<EOS>
But
I
herewith
discharge
my
conscience
,
and
declare
that
I
have
had
quite
enthusiastic
movements
of
admiration
towards
old
gentlemen
who
spoke
the
worst
English
,
who
were
occasionally
fretful
in
their
temper
,
and
who
had
never
moved
in
a
higher
sphere
of
influence
than
that
of
parish
overseer
;
and
that
the
way
in
which
I
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
human
nature
is
lovable
 
the
way
I
have
learnt
something
of
its
deep
pathos
,
its
sublime
mysteries
 
has
been
by
living
a
great
deal
among
people
more
or
less
commonplace
and
vulgar
,
of
whom
you
would
perhaps
hear
nothing
very
surprising
if
you
were
to
inquire
about
them
in
the
neighbourhoods
where
they
dwelt
.
<EOS>
Ten
to
one
most
of
the
small
shopkeepers
in
their
vicinity
saw
nothing
at
all
in
them
.
<EOS>
For
I
have
observed
this
remarkable
coincidence
,
that
the
select
natures
who
pant
after
the
ideal
,
and
find
nothing
in
pantaloons
or
petticoats
great
enough
to
command
their
reverence
and
love
,
are
curiously
in
unison
with
the
narrowest
and
pettiest
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
I
have
often
heard
Mr.
Gedge
,
the
landlord
of
the
Royal
Oak
,
who
used
to
turn
a
bloodshot
eye
on
his
neighbours
in
the
village
of
Shepperton
,
sum
up
his
opinion
of
the
people
in
his
own
parish
 
and
they
were
all
the
people
he
knew
 
in
these
emphatic
words
:
"
<EOS>
Aye
,
sir
,
I
've
said
it
often
,
and
I
'll
say
it
again
<EOS>
,
they
're
a
poor
lot
<EOS>
i
'
this
parish
 
<EOS>
a
poor
lot
,
sir
,
big
and
little
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
think
he
had
a
dim
idea
that
if
he
could
migrate
to
a
distant
parish
,
he
might
find
neighbours
worthy
of
him
;
and
indeed
he
did
subsequently
transfer
himself
to
the
Saracen
's
Head
,
which
was
doing
a
thriving
business
in
the
back
street
of
a
neighbouring
market
-
town
.
<EOS>
But
,
oddly
enough
,
he
has
found
the
people
up
that
back
street
of
precisely
the
same
stamp
as
the
inhabitants
of
Shepperton
 
"
a
poor
lot
,
sir
,
big
and
little
,
and
them
as
comes
for
a
go
o
'

are
no
better
than
them
as
comes
for
<EOS>
a
pint
o

twopenny

in
her
Sunday
hat
and
frock
.
<EOS>
For
her
hat
was
trimmed
with
pink
,
and
her
frock
had
pink
spots
,
sprinkled
on
a
white
ground
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
but
pink
and
white
about
her
,
except
in
her
dark
hair
and
eyes
and
her
little
buckled
shoes
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
was
provoked
at
herself
,
for
she
could
hardly
keep
from
smiling
,
as
any
mortal
is
inclined
to
do
at
the
sight
of
pretty
round
things
.
<EOS>
So
she
turned
without
speaking
,
and
joined
the
group
outside
the
house
door
,
followed
by
Hetty
,
whose
heart
was
fluttering
so
at
the
thought
of
some
one
she
expected
to
see
at
church
that
she
hardly
felt
the
ground
she
trod
on
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
little
procession
set
off
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
was
in
his
Sunday
suit
of
drab
,
with
a
red
-
and
-
green
waistcoat
and
a
green
watch
-
ribbon
having
a
large
cornelian
seal
attached
,
pendant
like
a
plumb
-
line
from
that
promontory
where
his
watch
-
pocket
was
situated
;
a
silk
handkerchief
of
a
yellow
tone
round
his
neck
;
and
excellent
grey
ribbed
stockings
,
knitted
by
Mrs.
Poyser
's
own
hand
,
setting
off
the
proportions
of
his
leg
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
had
no
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
his
leg
,
and
suspected
that
the
growing
abuse
of
top
-
boots
and
other
fashions
tending
to
disguise
the
nether
limbs
had
their
origin
in
a
pitiable
degeneracy
of
the
human
calf
.
<EOS>
Still
less
had
he
reason
to
be
ashamed
of
his
round
jolly
face
,
which
was
good
humour
itself
as
he
said
,
"
Come
,
Hetty
 
come
,
little
uns
!
"
<EOS>
and
giving
his
arm
to
his
wife
,
led
the
way
through
the
causeway
gate
into
the
yard
.
  
<EOS>
The
"
little
uns
"
addressed
were
Marty
and
Tommy
,
boys
of
nine
and
seven
,
in
little
fustian
tailed
coats
and
knee
-
breeches
,
relieved
by
rosy
cheeks
and
black
eyes
,
looking
as
much
like
their
father
as
a
very
small
elephant
is
like
a
very
large
one
.
<EOS>
Hetty
walked
between
them
,
and
behind
came
patient
Molly
,
whose
task
it
was
to
carry
Totty
through
the
yard
and
over
all
the
wet
places
on
the
road
;
for
Totty
,
having
speedily
recovered
from
her
threatened
fever
,
had
insisted
on
going
to
church
to
-
day
,
and
especially
on
wearing
her
red
-
and
-
black
necklace
outside
her
tippet
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
many
wet
places
for
her
to
be
carried
over
this
afternoon
,
for
there
had
been
heavy
showers
in
the
morning
,
though
now
the
clouds
had
rolled
off
and
lay
in
towering
silvery
masses
on
the
horizon
.
  
<EOS>
You
might
have
known
it
was
Sunday
if
you
had
only
waked
up
in
the
farmyard
.
<EOS>
The
cocks
and
hens
seemed
to
know
it
,
and
made
only
crooning
subdued
noises
;
the
very
bull
-
dog
looked
less
savage
,
as
if
he
would
have
been
satisfied
with
a
smaller
bite
than
usual
.
<EOS>
The
sunshine
seemed
to
call
all
things
to
rest
and
not
to
labour
.
<EOS>
It
was
asleep
itself
on
the
moss
-
grown
cow
-
shed
;
on
the
group
of
white
ducks
nestling
together
with
their
bills
tucked
under
their
wings
;
on
the
old
black
sow
stretched
languidly
on
the
straw
,
while
her
largest
young
one
found
an
excellent
spring
-
bed
on
his
mother
's
fat
ribs
;
on
Alick
,
the
shepherd
,
in
his
new
smock
-
frock
,
taking
an
uneasy
siesta
,
half
-
sitting
,
half
-
standing
on
the
granary
steps
.
<EOS>
Alick
was
of
opinion
that
church
,
like
other
luxuries
,
was
not
to
be
indulged
in
often
by
a
foreman
who
had
the
weather
and
the
ewes
on
his
mind
.
"
<EOS>
Church
!
<EOS>
Nay
 
I'n
gotten
summat
else
to
think
on
,
"
was
an
answer
which
he
often
uttered
in
a
tone
of
bitter
significance
that
silenced
further
question
.
<EOS>
I
feel
sure
Alick
meant
no
irreverence
;
indeed
,
I
know
that
his
mind
was
not
of
a
speculative
,
negative
cast
,
and
he
would
on
no
account
have
missed
going
to
church
on
Christmas
Day
,
Easter
Sunday
,
and
"
Whissuntide
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
had
a
general
impression
that
public
worship
and
religious
ceremonies
,
like
other
non
-
productive
employments
,
were
intended
for
people
who
had
leisure
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
Father
a
-
standing
at
the
yard
-
gate
,
"
said
Martin
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
I
reckon
he
wants
to
watch
us
down
the
field
.
<EOS>
It
's
wonderful
<EOS>
what
sight
he
has
,
and
him
turned
seventy
-
five
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
often
think
it
's
wi
'
th
'
old
folks
as
it
is
wi
'
the
babbies
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
;
<EOS>
"
they
're
satisfied
wi
'
looking
,
no
matter
what
they
're
looking
at
.
<EOS>
It
's
God
<EOS>
A'mighty
's
way
<EOS>
o
'
quietening
'em
<EOS>
,
I
reckon
,
afore
they
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Old
Martin
opened
the
gate
as
he
saw
the
family
procession
approaching
,
and
held
it
wide
open
,
leaning
on
his
stick
 
pleased
to
do
this
bit
of
work
;
for
,
like
all
old
men
whose
life
has
been
spent
in
labour
,
he
liked
to
feel
that
he
was
still
useful
 
that
there
was
a
better
crop
of
onions
in
the
garden
because
he
was
by
at
the
sowing
 
and
that
the
cows
would
be
milked
the
better
if
he
stayed
at
home
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
to
look
on
.
<EOS>
He
always
went
to
church
on
Sacrament
Sundays
,
but
not
very
regularly
at
other
times
;
on
wet
Sundays
,
or
whenever
he
had
a
touch
of
rheumatism
,
he
used
to
read
the
three
first
chapters
of
Genesis
instead
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
'll
ha
'
putten
Thias
Bede
<EOS>
i
'
the
ground
afore
ye
get
to
the
churchyard
,
"
he
said
,
as
his
son
came
up
.
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
ha
'
been
better
luck
if
they
'd
ha
'
buried
him
<EOS>
i
'
the
forenoon
when
the
rain
was
fallin
'
<EOS>
;
there
's
no
likelihoods
of
a
drop
now
;
an
'
the
moon
lies
like
a
boat
there
,
dost
see
?
<EOS>
That
's
a
sure
sign
o
'
fair
weather
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
many
as
is
false
<EOS>
but
that
's
sure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
the
son
,
"
I
'm
in
hopes
it
'll
hold
up
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mind
what
the
parson
says
,
mind
what
the
parson
says
,
my
lads
,
"
said
Grandfather
to
the
black
-
eyed
youngsters
in
knee
-
breeches
,
conscious
of
a
marble
or
two
in
their
pockets
which
they
looked
forward
to
handling
,
a
little
,
secretly
,
during
the
sermon
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dood
-
bye
,
Dandad
,
"
said
Totty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Me
doin'
to
church
.
<EOS>
Me
dot
my
neklace
on
.
<EOS>
Dive

a
peppermint

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Grandad
,
shaking
with
laughter
at
this
"
deep
little
wench
,
"
slowly
transferred
his
stick
to
his
left
hand
,
which
held
the
gate
open
,
and
slowly
thrust
his
finger
into
the
waistcoat
pocket
on
which
Totty
had
fixed
her
eyes
with
a
confident
look
of
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
And
when
they
were
all
gone
,
the
old
man
leaned
on
the
gate
again
,
watching
them
across
the
lane
along
the
Home
Close
,
and
through
the
far
gate
,
till
they
disappeared
behind
a
bend
in
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
For
the
hedgerows
in
those
days
shut
out
one
's
view
,
even
on
the
better
-
managed
farms
;
and
this
afternoon
,
the
dog
-
roses
were
tossing
out
their
pink
wreaths
,
the
nightshade
was
in
its
yellow
and
purple
glory
,
the
pale
honeysuckle
grew
out
of
reach
,
peeping
high
up
out
of
a
holly
bush
,
and
over
all
an
ash
or
a
sycamore
every
now
and
then
threw
its
shadow
across
the
path
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
acquaintances
at
other
gates
who
had
to
move
aside
and
let
them
pass
:
at
the
gate
of
the
Home
Close
there
was
half
the
dairy
of
cows
standing
one
behind
the
other
,
extremely
slow
to
understand
that
their
large
bodies
might
be
in
the
way
;
at
the
far
gate
there
was
the
mare
holding
her
head
over
the
bars
,
and
beside
her
the
liver
-
coloured
foal
with
its
head
towards
its
mother
's
flank
,
apparently
still
much
embarrassed
by
its
own
straddling
existence
.
<EOS>
The
way
lay
entirely
through
Mr.
Poyser
's
own
fields
till
they
reached
the
main
road
leading
to
the
village
,
and
he
turned
a
keen
eye
on
the
stock
and
the
crops
as
they
went
along
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
was
ready
to
supply
a
running
commentary
on
them
all
.
<EOS>
The
woman
who
manages
a
dairy
has
a
large
share
in
making
the
rent
,
so
she
may
well
be
allowed
to
have
her
opinion
on
stock
and
their
"
keep
"
 
an
exercise
which
strengthens
her
understanding
so
much
that
she
finds
herself
able
to
give
her
husband
advice
on
most
other
subjects
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
that
shorthorned
Sally
,
"
she
said
,
as
they
entered
the
Home
Close
,
and
she
caught
sight
of
the
meek
beast
that
lay
chewing
the
cud
and
looking
at
her
with
a
sleepy
eye
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
hate
the
sight
<EOS>
o
'
the
cow
;
and
<EOS>
I
say
now
what
I
said
three
weeks
ago
,
the
sooner
we
get
rid
of
her
the
better
,
<EOS>
for
there
's
that
little
yallow
cow
as
does
n't
give
half
the
milk
,
and
yet
I
've
twice
as
much
butter
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thee't
not
like
the
women
in
general
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
"
they
like
the
shorthorns
,
as
give
such
a
lot
o
'
milk
.
<EOS>
There
's
Chowne
's
wife
wants
him
to
buy
no
other
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
it
sinnify
what
Chowne
's
wife
likes
?
<EOS>
A
poor
soft
thing
,
wi
'
no
more
head
-
piece
nor
a
sparrow
.
<EOS>
She
'd
take
a
big
cullender
to
strain
her
lard
wi
'
,
and
then
wonder
as
the
scratchin
's
run
through
.
<EOS>
I
've
seen
enough
of
her
to
know
as
I
'll
niver
take
a
servant
from
her
house
again
 
all
hugger
-
mugger
 
<EOS>
and
you
'd
niver
know

when
you
went
in

whether
it
was
Monday
or
Friday

the
wash
draggin

o

and
<EOS>
as
for

I
know
well
enough
it
rose
like
a

in

And
then
she
talks

"
Well

wanting

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
secretly
proud
of
his
wife
's
superior
power
of
putting
two
and
two
together
;
<EOS>
indeed
,
on
recent
market
-
days
he
had
more
than
once
boasted
of
her
discernment
in
this
very
matter
of
shorthorns
.
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
them
as
choose
a
soft
for
a
wife
<EOS>
may
's
well
buy
up
the
shorthorns

for
if
you
get
your

stuck
in

your

well
go
after

<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
Talk
o

legs

there

legs
for

"
Mrs.
Poyser
continued
,
as
Totty
,
who
had
been
set
down
now
the
road
was
dry
,
<EOS>
toddled
on
in
front
of
her
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
"
There

<EOS>
An

<EOS>

The

An

Though
for

that

there

people

<EOS>
If

colour

an

did

<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay

nay

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
rather
a
contemptuous
emphasis
,
"

<EOS>
It

know
how

Well

<EOS>
what

how
to
make
a
choice
when

thee

"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
usually
settled
little
conjugal
disputes
by
a
compliment
of
this
sort
;
"
and
thee
wast
twice
as
buxom
as
Dinah
ten
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
niver
said
as
a
woman
had
need
to
be
ugly
to
make
a
good
missis
of
a
house
.
<EOS>
There
's
Chowne
's
wife
ugly
enough
to
turn
the
milk
an
'
save
the
rennet
,
but
she
'll
niver
save
nothing
any
other
way

<EOS>
But
as
for
Dinah
,
poor
child
,
she
's
niver
likely
to
be
buxom
as
long
as
she
'll
make
<EOS>
her
dinner
o
'
cake
and
water
,
for
the
sake
<EOS>
o
'
giving
to
them
as
want
.
<EOS>
She
provoked
me
past
bearing
sometimes
;
and
,
as
I
told
her
,
she
went
clean
again
'
the
Scriptur
'
,
for
that
says
,
"
Love
your
neighbour
as
yourself
"
;
"
but
,
<EOS>
"
I
said
,
"
if
you
loved
your
neighbour
no
better
nor
you
do
yourself
,
Dinah
,
it
's
little
enough
<EOS>
you
'd
do
for
him
.
<EOS>
You
'd
be
thinking
he
might
do
well
enough
on
a
half
-
empty
stomach
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eh
,
I
wonder
where
she
is
this
blessed
Sunday
!
<EOS>
Sitting
by
that
sick
woman
,
I
daresay
,
as
she
'd
set
her
heart
on
going
to
all
of
a
sudden
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
was
a
pity
she
should
take
such
megrims
into
her
head
,
when
she
might
ha
'
stayed
wi
'
us
all
summer
,
and
eaten
twice
as
much
as
she
wanted
,
and
it
'
ud
niver
ha
'
been
missed
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
odds
in
th
'
house
at
all
,
for
she
sat
as
still
at
her
sewing
as
a
bird
on
the
nest
,
and
was
uncommon
nimble
at
running
to
fetch
anything
.
<EOS>
If
Hetty
gets
married
,
theed'st
like
to
ha
'
Dinah
wi
'
thee
constant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
thinking
o
'
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
You
might
as
well
beckon
to
the
flying
swallow
as
ask
Dinah
to
come
an
'
live
here
comfortable
,
like
other
folks
.
<EOS>
If
anything
could
turn
her
,
I
should
ha
'
turned
her
,
for
I
've
talked
to
her
for
a
hour
on
end
,
and
scolded
her
too
;
for
she
's
my
own
sister
's
child
,
and
it
behoves
me
to
do
what
I
can
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
eh
,
poor
thing
,
as
soon
as
she
'd
said
us
'
good
-
bye
'
an
'
got
into
the
cart
,
an
'
looked
back
at
me
with
her
pale
face
,
as
is
welly
like
her
Aunt
Judith
come
back
from
heaven
,
I
begun
to
be
frightened
to
think
o
'
the
set
-
downs
I
'd
given
her
;
for
it
comes
over
you
sometimes
as
if
she
'd
a
way
<EOS>
o
'
knowing
the
rights
o
'
things
more
nor
other
folks
have
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
niver
give
in
as
that
's
'cause
she
's
a
Methodist
,
no
more
nor
a
white
calf
's
white
'cause
it
eats
out
o
'
the
same
bucket
wi
'
a
black
un
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
as
near
an
approach
to
a
snarl
as
his
good
-
nature
would
allow
;
"
I
'm
no
opinion
<EOS>
o
'
the
Methodists
.
<EOS>
It
's
on'y
tradesfolks
as
turn
Methodists
;
you
nuver
knew
a
farmer
bitten
wi
'
them
maggots

<EOS>
There
's
maybe
a
workman
now
an
'
then
,
as
is
n't
overclever
at
<EOS>
's
work
,
takes
to
preachin
'
an
'
that
,
like
Seth
Bede

<EOS>
But
you
see
Adam
,
as
has
got
one
o
'
the
best
head
-
pieces
hereabout
,
knows
better
;
he
's
a
good
Churchman
,
<EOS>
else
I
'd
never
encourage
him
for
a
sweetheart
for
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
goodness
me
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
had
looked
back
while
her
husband
was
speaking
,
"
<EOS>
look
where
Molly
is
with
them
lads
!
<EOS>
They
're
the
field
's
length
behind
us
.
<EOS>
How
COULD
you
let
'em
do
so
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Anybody
might
as
well
set
a
pictur
'
to
watch
the
children
as
you
.
<EOS>
Run
back
and
tell
'em
to
come
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
were
now
at
the
end
of
the
second
field
,
so
they
set
Totty
on
the
top
of
one
of
the
large
stones
forming
the
true
Loamshire
stile
,
and
awaited
the
loiterers
Totty
observing
with
complacency
,
"
Dey
naughty
,
naughty
boys
 
me
dood
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
fact
was
that
this
Sunday
walk
through
the
fields
was
fraught
with
great
excitement
to
Marty
and
Tommy
,
who
saw
a
perpetual
drama
going
on
in
the
hedgerows
,
and
could
no
more
refrain
from
stopping
and
peeping
than
if
they
had
been
a
couple
of
spaniels
or
terriers
.
<EOS>
Marty
was
quite
sure
he
saw
a
yellow
-
hammer
on
the
boughs
of
the
great
ash
,
and
while
he
was
peeping
,
he
missed
the
sight
of
a
white
-
throated
stoat
,
which
had
run
across
the
path
and
was
described
with
much
fervour
by
the
junior
Tommy
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
a
little
greenfinch
,
just
fledged
,
fluttering
along
the
ground
,
and
it
seemed
quite
possible
to
catch
it
,
till
it
managed
to
flutter
under
the
blackberry
bush
.
<EOS>
Hetty
could
not
be
got
to
give
any
heed
to
these
things
,
so
Molly
was
called
on
for
her
ready
sympathy
,
and
peeped
with
open
mouth
wherever
she
was
told
,
and
said
"
Lawks
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
whenever
she
was
expected
to
wonder
.
  
<EOS>
Molly
hastened
on
with
some
alarm
when
Hetty
had
come
back
and
called
to
them
that
her
aunt
was
angry
;
but
Marty
ran
on
first
,
shouting
,
"
We
've
found
the
speckled
turkey
's
nest
,
Mother
!
"
<EOS>
with
the
instinctive
confidence
that
people
who
bring
good
news
are
never
in
fault
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
really
forgetting
all
discipline
in
this
pleasant
surprise
,
<EOS>
"
that
's
a
good
lad
;
why
,
where
is
it
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Down
in
ever
such
a
hole
,
under
the
hedge
.
<EOS>
I
saw
it
first
,
looking
after
the
greenfinch
,
and
she
sat
on
th
'
nest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
frighten
her
,
I
hope
,
"
said
the
mother
,
"
else
she
'll
forsake
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
went
away
as
still
as
still
,
and
whispered
to
<EOS>
Molly
 
did
n't
I
,
Molly
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
now
come
on
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
and
walk
before
Father
and
Mother
,
and
take
your
little
sister
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
straight
on
now
.
<EOS>
Good
boys
do
n't
look
after
the
birds
of
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mother
,
"
said
Marty
,
"
you
said
you
'd
give
half
-
a
-
crown
to
find
the
speckled
turkey
's
nest
.
<EOS>
May
n't
I
have
the
half
-
crown
put
into
my
money
-
box
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
'll
see
about
that
,
my
lad
,
if
you
walk
along
now
,
like
a
good
boy
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
father
and
mother
exchanged
a
significant
glance
of
amusement
at
their
eldest
-
born
's
acuteness
;
but
on
Tommy
's
round
face
there
was
a
cloud
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
half
-
crying
,
"
Marty
's
got
ever
so
much
more
money
in
his
box
nor
I
've
got
in
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Munny
,
me
want
half
-
a
-
toun
in
my
bots
,
"
said
Totty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
,
hush
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
did
ever
anybody
hear
such
naughty
children
?
<EOS>
Nobody
shall
ever
see
their
money
-
boxes
any
more
,
if
they
do
n't
make
haste
and
go
on
to
church
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
dreadful
threat
had
the
desired
effect
,
and
through
the
two
remaining
fields
the
three
pair
of
small
legs
trotted
on
without
any
serious
interruption
,
notwithstanding
a
small
pond
full
of
tadpoles
,
alias
"
bullheads
,
"
which
the
lads
looked
at
wistfully
.
  
<EOS>
The
damp
hay
that
must
be
scattered
and
turned
afresh
to
<EOS>
-
morrow
was
not
a
cheering
sight
to
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
during
hay
and
corn
harvest
had
often
some
mental
struggles
as
to
the
benefits
of
a
day
of
rest
;
but
no
temptation
would
have
induced
him
to
carry
on
any
field
-
work
,
however
early
in
the
morning
,
on
a
Sunday
;
for
had
not
Michael
Holdsworth
had
a
pair
of
oxen
"
sweltered
"
while
he
was
ploughing
on
Good
Friday
?
<EOS>
That
was
a
demonstration
that
work
on
sacred
days
was
a
wicked
thing
;
and
with
wickedness
of
any
sort
Martin
Poyser
was
quite
clear
that
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
,
since
money
got
by
such
means
would
never
prosper
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
a'most
makes
your
fingers
itch
to
be
at
the
hay
<EOS>
now
the
sun
shines
so
,
"
he
observed
,
as
they
passed
through
the
"
Big
Meadow
.
"
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
poor
foolishness
to
think
o
'
saving
by
going
against
your
conscience
.
<EOS>
There
's
that
Jim
Wakefield
,
as
they
used
to
call
"
Gentleman
Wakefield
,
"
used
to
do
the
same
of
a
Sunday
as
o
'
weekdays
,
and
took
no
heed
to
right
or
wrong
,
as
if
there
was
nayther
God
nor
devil
.
<EOS>
An
'
what
's
he
come
to
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
saw
him
myself
last
market
-
day
a
-
carrying
a
basket
wi
'
oranges
in't
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
emphatically
,
"
you
make
but
a
poor
trap
to
catch
luck
if
you
go
and
bait
it
wi
'
wickedness
.
<EOS>
The
money
as
is
got
<EOS>
so
's
like
to
burn
holes
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
your
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
'd
niver
wish
us
to
leave
our
lads
a
sixpence
but
what
was
got
i
'
the
rightful
way
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
the
weather
,
there
's
One
above
makes
it
,
and
we
must
put
up
wi't
<EOS>
:
it
's
nothing
of
a
plague
to
what
the
wenches
are
.
"
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
interruption
in
their
walk
,
the
excellent
habit
which
Mrs.
Poyser
's
clock
had
of
taking
time
by
the
forelock
had
secured
their
arrival
at
the
village
while
it
was
still
a
quarter
to
two
,
though
almost
every
one
who
meant
to
go
to
church
was
already
within
the
churchyard
gates
.
<EOS>
Those
who
stayed
at
home
were
chiefly
mothers
,
like
Timothy
's
Bess
,
who
stood
at
her
own
door
nursing
her
baby
and
feeling
as
women
feel
in
that
position
 
that
nothing
else
can
be
expected
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
entirely
to
see
Thias
Bede
's
funeral
that
the
people
were
standing
about
the
churchyard
so
long
before
service
began
;
that
was
their
common
practice
.
<EOS>
The
women
,
indeed
,
usually
entered
the
church
at
once
,
and
the
farmers
'
wives
talked
in
an
undertone
to
each
other
,
over
the
tall
pews
,
about
their
illnesses
and
the
total
failure
of
doctor
's
stuff
,
recommending
dandelion
-
tea
,
and
other
home
-
made
specifics
,
as
far
preferable
 
about
the
servants
,
and
their
growing
exorbitance
as
to
wages
,
whereas
the
quality
of
their
services
declined
from
year
to
year
,
and
there
was
no
girl
nowadays
to
be
trusted
any
further
than
you
could
see
her
 
about
the
bad
price
<EOS>
Mr.
Dingall
,
the
Treddleston
grocer
,
was
giving
for
butter
,
and
the
reasonable
doubts
that
might
be
held
as
to
his
solvency
,
notwithstanding
that
Mrs.
Dingall
was
a
sensible
woman
,
and
they
were
all
sorry
for
HER
,
for
she
had
very
good
kin
.
<EOS>
Meantime
the
men
lingered
outside
,
and
hardly
any
of
them
except
the
singers
,
who
had
a
humming
and
fragmentary
rehearsal
to
go
through
,
entered
the
church
until
Mr.
Irwine
was
in
the
desk
.
<EOS>
They
saw
no
reason
for
that
premature
entrance
 
<EOS>
what
could
they
do
in
church
if
they
were
there
before
service
began
?
 
<EOS>
and
they
did
not
conceive
that
any
power
in
the
universe
could
take
it
ill
of
them
if
they
stayed
out
and
talked
a
little
about

bus'ness

Chad
Cranage
looks
like
quite
a
new
acquaintance
to
-
day
,
for
he
has
got
his
clean
Sunday
face
,
which
always
makes
his
little
granddaughter
cry
at
him
as
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
But
an
experienced
eye
would
have
fixed
on
him
at
once
as
the
village
blacksmith
,
after
seeing
the
humble
deference
with
which
the
big
saucy
fellow
took
off
his
hat
and
stroked
his
hair
to
the
farmers
;
for
Chad
was
accustomed
to
say
that
a
working
-
man
must
hold
a
candle
to
a
personage
understood
to
be
as
black
as
he
was
himself
on
weekdays
;
by
which
evil
-
sounding
rule
of
conduct
he
meant
what
was
,
after
all
,
rather
virtuous
than
otherwise
,
namely
,
that
men
who
had
horses
to
be
shod
must
be
treated
with
respect
.
<EOS>
Chad
and
the
rougher
sort
of
workmen
kept
aloof
from
the
grave
under
the
white
thorn
,
where
the
burial
was
going
forward
;
but
Sandy
Jim
,
and
several
of
the
farm
-
labourers
,
made
a
group
round
it
,
and
stood
with
their
hats
off
,
as
fellow
-
mourners
with
the
mother
and
sons
.
<EOS>
Others
held
a
midway
position
,
sometimes
watching
the
group
at
the
grave
,
sometimes
listening
to
the
conversation
of
the
farmers
,
who
stood
in
a
knot
near
the
church
door
,
and
were
now
joined
by
Martin
Poyser
,
while
his
family
passed
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
On
the
outside
of
this
knot
stood
Mr.
Casson
,
the
landlord
of
the
Donnithorne
Arms
,
in
his
most
striking
attitude
 
that
is
to
say
,
with
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
thrust
between
the
buttons
of
his
waistcoat
,
his
left
hand
in
his
breeches
pocket
,
and
his
head
very
much
on
one
side
;
looking
,
on
the
whole
,
like
an
actor
who
has
only
a
mono
-
syllabic
part
entrusted
to
him
,
but
feels
sure
that
the
audience
discern
his
fitness
for
the
leading
business
;
curiously
in
contrast
with
old
Jonathan
Burge
,
who
held
his
hands
behind
him
and
leaned
forward
,
coughing
asthmatically
,
with
an
inward
scorn
of
all
knowingness
that
could
not
be
turned
into
cash
.
<EOS>
The
talk
was
in
rather
a
lower
tone
than
usual
to
-
day
,
hushed
a
little
by
the
sound
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
voice
reading
the
final
prayers
of
the
burial
-
service
.
<EOS>
They
had
all
had
their
word
of
pity
for
poor
Thias
,
but
now
they
had
got
upon
the
nearer
subject
of
their
own
grievances
against
Satchell
,
the
Squire
's
bailiff
,
who
played
the
part
of
steward
so
far
as
it
was
not
performed
by
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
himself
,
for
that
gentleman
<EOS>
had
the
meanness
to
receive
his
own
rents
and
make
bargains
about
his
own
timber
.
<EOS>
This
subject
of
conversation
was
an
additional
reason
for
not
being
loud
,
since
Satchell
himself
might
presently
be
walking
up
the
paved
road
to
the
church
door
.
<EOS>
And
soon
they
became
suddenly
silent
;
for
Mr.
Irwine
's
voice
had
ceased
,
and
the
group
round
the
white
thorn
was
dispersing
itself
towards
the
church
.
  
<EOS>
They
all
moved
aside
,
and
stood
with
their
hats
off
,
while
Mr.
Irwine
passed
.
<EOS>
Adam
and
Seth
were
coming
next
,
with
their
mother
between
them
;
for
Joshua
Rann
officiated
as
head
sexton
as
well
as
clerk
,
and
was
not
yet
ready
to
follow
the
rector
into
the
vestry
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
pause
before
the
three
mourners
came
on
<EOS>
:
Lisbeth
had
turned
round
to
look
again
towards
the
grave
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
now
but
the
brown
earth
under
the
white
thorn
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
cried
less
to
-
day
than
she
had
done
any
day
since
her
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
Along
with
all
her
grief
there
was
mixed
an
unusual
sense
of
her
own
importance
in
having
a
"
burial
,
"
and
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
reading
a
special
service
for
her
husband
;
and
besides
,
she
knew
the
funeral
psalm
was
going
to
be
sung
for
him
.
<EOS>
She
felt
this
counter
-
excitement
to
her
sorrow
still
more
strongly
as
she
walked
with
her
sons
towards
the
church
door
,
and
saw
the
friendly
sympathetic
nods
of
their
fellow
-
parishioners
.
  
<EOS>
The
mother
and
sons
passed
into
the
church
,
and
one
by
one
the
loiterers
followed
,
though
some
still
lingered
without
;
the
sight
of
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
carriage
,
which
was
winding
slowly
up
the
hill
,
perhaps
helping
to
make
them
feel
that
there
was
no
need
for
haste
.
  
<EOS>
But
presently
the
sound
of
the
bassoon
and
the
key
-
bugles
burst
forth
;
the
evening
hymn
,
which
always
opened
the
service
,
had
begun
,
and
every
one
must
now
enter
and
take
his
place
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
the
interior
of
Hayslope
Church
was
remarkable
for
anything
except
for
the
grey
age
of
its
oaken
pews
 
great
square
pews
mostly
,
<EOS>
ranged
on
each
side
of
a
narrow
aisle
.
<EOS>
It
was
free
,
indeed
,
from
the
modern
blemish
of
galleries
.
<EOS>
The
choir
had
two
narrow
pews
to
themselves
in
the
middle
of
the
right
-
hand
row
,
so
that
it
was
a
short
process
for
Joshua
Rann
to
take
his
place
among
them
as
principal
bass
,
and
return
to
his
desk
after
the
singing
was
over
.
<EOS>
The
pulpit
and
desk
,
grey
and
old
as
the
pews
,
stood
on
one
side
of
the
arch
leading
into
the
chancel
,
which
also
had
its
grey
square
pews
for
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
family
and
servants
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
assure
you
these
grey
pews
,
with
the
buff
-
washed
walls
,
gave
a
very
pleasing
tone
to
this
shabby
interior
,
and
agreed
extremely
well
with
the
ruddy
faces
and
bright
waistcoats
.
<EOS>
And
there
were
liberal
touches
of
crimson
toward
the
chancel
,
for
the
pulpit
and
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
own
pew
had
handsome
crimson
cloth
cushions
;
and
,
to
close
the
vista
,
there
was
a
crimson
altar
-
cloth
,
embroidered
with
golden
rays
by
Miss
Lydia
's
own
hand
.
  
<EOS>
But
even
without
the
crimson
cloth
,
the
effect
must
have
been
warm
and
cheering
when
Mr.
Irwine
was
in
the
desk
,
looking
benignly
round
on
that
simple
congregation
 
on
the
hardy
old
men
,
with
bent
knees
and
shoulders
,
perhaps
,
but
with
vigour
left
for
much
hedge
-
clipping
and
thatching
;
on
the
tall
stalwart
frames
and
roughly
cut
bronzed
faces
of
the
stone
-
cutters
and
carpenters
;
on
the
half
-
dozen
well
-
to
-
do
farmers
,
with
their
apple
-
cheeked
families
;
and
on
the
clean
old
women
,
mostly
farm
-
labourers
'
wives
,
with
their
bit
of
snow
-
white
cap
-
border
under
their
black
bonnets
,
and
with
their
withered
arms
,
bare
from
the
elbow
,
folded
passively
over
their
chests
.
<EOS>
For
none
of
the
old
people
held
books
 
<EOS>
why
should
they
?
<EOS>
Not
one
of
them
could
read
.
<EOS>
But
they
knew
a
few
"
good
words
"
by
heart
,
and
their
withered
lips
now
and
then
moved
silently
,
following
the
service
without
any
very
clear
comprehension
indeed
,
but
with
a
simple
faith
in
its
efficacy
to
ward
off
harm
and
bring
blessing
.
<EOS>
And
now
all
faces
were
visible
,
for
all
were
standing
up
 
the
little
children
on
the
seats
peeping
over
the
edge
of
the
grey
pews
,
while
good
Bishop
Ken
's
evening
hymn
was
being
sung
to
one
of
those
lively
psalm
-
tunes
which
died
out
with
the
last
generation
of
rectors
and
choral
parish
clerks
.
<EOS>
Melodies
die
out
,
like
the
pipe
of
Pan
,
with
the
ears
that
love
them
and
listen
for
them
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
not
in
his
usual
place
among
the
singers
to
-
day
,
for
he
sat
with
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
he
noticed
with
surprise
that
Bartle
Massey
was
absent
too
 
all
the
more
agreeable
for
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
,
who
gave
out
his
bass
notes
with
unusual
complacency
and
threw
an
extra
ray
of
severity
into
the
glances
he
sent
over
his
spectacles
at
the
recusant
Will
Maskery
.
  
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
to
imagine
Mr.
Irwine
looking
round
on
this
scene
,
in
his
ample
white
surplice
that
became
him
so
well
,
with
his
powdered
hair
thrown
back
,
his
rich
brown
complexion
,
and
his
finely
cut
nostril
and
upper
lip
;
for
there
was
a
certain
virtue
in
that
benignant
yet
keen
countenance
as
there
is
in
all
human
faces
from
which
a
generous
soul
beams
out
.
<EOS>
And
over
all
streamed
the
delicious
June
sunshine
through
the
old
windows
,
with
their
desultory
patches
of
yellow
,
red
,
and
blue
,
that
threw
pleasant
touches
of
colour
on
the
opposite
wall
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
looked
round
to
-
day
,
his
eyes
rested
an
instant
longer
than
usual
on
the
square
pew
occupied
by
Martin
Poyser
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
another
pair
of
dark
eyes
that
found
it
impossible
not
to
wander
thither
,
and
rest
on
that
round
pink
-
and
-
white
figure
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
was
at
that
moment
quite
careless
of
any
glances
 
she
was
absorbed
in
the
thought
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
would
soon
be
coming
into
church
,
for
the
carriage
<EOS>
must
surely
be
at
the
church
-
gate
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
seen
him
since
she
parted
with
him
in
the
wood
on
Thursday
evening
,
and
oh
,
how
long
the
time
had
seemed
!
<EOS>
Things
had
gone
on
just
the
same
as
ever
since
that
evening
;
the
wonders
that
had
happened
then
had
brought
no
changes
after
them
;
they
were
already
like
a
dream
.
<EOS>
When
she
heard
the
church
door
swinging
,
her
heart
beat
so
<EOS>
,
she
dared
not
look
up
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
her
aunt
was
curtsying
;
she
curtsied
herself
.
<EOS>
That
must
be
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
 
<EOS>
he
always
came
first
,
the
wrinkled
small
old
man
,
peering
round
with
short
-
sighted
glances
at
the
bowing
and
curtsying
congregation
;
then
she
knew
Miss
Lydia
was
passing
,
and
though
Hetty
liked
so
much
to
look
at
her
fashionable
little
coal
-
scuttle
bonnet
,
with
the
wreath
of
small
roses
round
it
,
she
did
n't
mind
it
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
But
there
were
no
more
curtsies
 
<EOS>
no
,
he
was
not
come
;
she
felt
sure
there
was
nothing
else
passing
the
pew
door
but
the
house
-
keeper
's
black
bonnet
and
the
lady
's
maid
's
beautiful
straw
hat
that
had
once
been
Miss
Lydia
's
,
and
then
the
powdered
heads
of
the
butler
and
footman
.
<EOS>
No
,
he
was
not
there
;
yet
she
would
look
now
 
<EOS>
she
might
be
mistaken
 
for
,
after
all
,
she
had
not
looked
.
<EOS>
So
she
lifted
up
her
eyelids
and
glanced
timidly
at
the
cushioned
pew
in
the
chancel
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
one
but
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
rubbing
his
spectacles
with
his
white
handkerchief
,
and
Miss
Lydia
opening
the
large
gilt
-
edged
prayer
-
book
.
<EOS>
The
chill
disappointment
was
too
hard
to
bear
.
<EOS>
She
felt
herself
turning
pale
,
her
lips
trembling
;
she
was
ready
to
cry
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
what
SHOULD
she
do
?
<EOS>
Everybody
would
know
the
reason
;
they
would
know
she
was
crying
because
Arthur
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Craig
,
with
the
wonderful
hothouse
plant
in
his
button
-
hole
,
was
staring
at
her
,
she
knew
.
<EOS>
It
was
dreadfully
long
before
the
General
Confession
began
,
so
that
she
could
kneel
down
.
<EOS>
Two
great
drops
WOULD
fall
then
,
but
no
one
saw
them
except
good
-
natured
Molly
,
for
her
aunt
and
uncle
knelt
with
their
backs
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Molly
,
unable
to
imagine
any
cause
for
tears
in
church
except
faintness
,
of
which
she
had
a
vague
traditional
knowledge
,
drew
out
of
her
pocket
a
queer
little
flat
blue
smelling
-
bottle
,
and
after
much
labour
in
pulling
the
cork
out
,
thrust
the
narrow
neck
against
Hetty
's
nostrils
.
<EOS>
"
It
donna
smell
,
"
she
whispered
,
thinking
this
was
a
great
advantage
which
old
salts
had
over
fresh
ones
:
they
did
you
good
without
biting
your
nose
.
<EOS>
Hetty
pushed
it
away
peevishly
;
but
this
little
flash
of
temper
did
what
the
salts
could
not
have
done
 
<EOS>
it
roused
her
to
wipe
away
the
traces
of
her
tears
,
and
try
with
all
her
might
not
to
shed
any
more
.
<EOS>
Hetty
had
a
certain
strength
in
her
vain
little
nature
:
she
would
have
borne
anything
rather
than
be
laughed
at
,
or
pointed
at
with
any
other
feeling
than
admiration
;
she
would
have
pressed
her
own
nails
into
her
tender
flesh
rather
than
<EOS>
people
should
know
a
secret
she
did
not
want
them
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
What
fluctuations
there
were
in
her
busy
thoughts
and
feelings
,
while
Mr.
Irwine
was
pronouncing
the
solemn
"
Absolution
"
in
her
deaf
ears
,
and
through
all
the
tones
of
petition
that
followed
!
<EOS>
Anger
lay
very
close
to
disappointment
,
and
soon
won
the
victory
over
the
conjectures
her
small
ingenuity
could
devise
to
account
for
Arthur
's
absence
on
the
supposition
that
he
really
wanted
to
come
,
really
wanted
to
see
her
again
.
<EOS>
And
by
the
time
she
rose
from
her
knees
mechanically
,
because
all
the
rest
were
rising
,
the
colour
had
returned
to
her
cheeks
even
with
a
heightened
glow
,
for
she
was
framing
little
indignant
speeches
to
herself
,
saying
she
hated
Arthur
for
giving
her
this
pain
 
she
would
like
him
to
suffer
too
.
<EOS>
Yet
while
this
selfish
tumult
was
going
on
in
her
soul
,
her
eyes
were
bent
down
on
her
prayer
-
book
,
and
the
eyelids
with
their
dark
fringe
looked
as
lovely
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Adam
Bede
thought
so
,
as
he
glanced
at
her
for
a
moment
on
rising
from
his
knees
.
  
<EOS>
But
Adam
's
thoughts
of
Hetty
did
not
deafen
him
to
the
service
;
they
rather
blended
with
all
the
other
deep
feelings
for
which
the
church
service
was
a
channel
to
him
this
afternoon
,
as
a
certain
consciousness
of
our
entire
past
and
our
imagined
future
blends
itself
with
all
our
moments
of
keen
sensibility
.
<EOS>
And
to
Adam
the
church
service
was
the
best
channel
he
could
have
found
for
his
mingled
regret
,
yearning
,
and
resignation
;
its
interchange
of
beseeching
cries
for
help
with
outbursts
of
faith
and
praise
,
its
recurrent
responses
and
the
familiar
rhythm
of
its
collects
,
seemed
to
speak
for
him
as
no
other
form
of
worship
could
have
done
;
as
,
to
those
early
Christians
who
had
worshipped
from
their
childhood
upwards
in
catacombs
,
the
torch
-
light
and
shadows
must
have
seemed
nearer
the
Divine
presence
than
the
heathenish
daylight
of
the
streets
.
<EOS>
The
secret
of
our
emotions
never
lies
in
the
bare
object
,
but
in
its
subtle
relations
to
our
own
past
:
no
wonder
the
secret
escapes
the
unsympathizing
observer
,
who
might
as
well
put
on
his
spectacles
to
discern
odours
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
reason
why
even
a
chance
comer
would
have
found
the
service
in
Hayslope
Church
more
impressive
than
in
most
other
village
nooks
in
the
kingdom
 
<EOS>
a
reason
of
which
I
am
sure
you
have
not
the
slightest
suspicion
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
reading
of
our
friend
Joshua
Rann
.
<EOS>
Where
that
good
shoemaker
got
his
notion
of
reading
from
remained
a
mystery
even
to
his
most
intimate
acquaintances
.
<EOS>
I
believe
,
after
all
,
he
got
it
chiefly
from
Nature
,
who
had
poured
some
of
her
music
into
this
honest
conceited
soul
,
as
she
had
been
known
to
do
into
other
narrow
souls
before
his
.
<EOS>
She
had
given
him
,
at
least
,
a
fine
bass
voice
and
a
musical
ear
;
but
I
can
not
positively
say
whether
these
alone
had
sufficed
to
inspire
him
with
the
rich
chant
in
which
he
delivered
the
responses
.
<EOS>
The
way
he
rolled
from
a
rich
deep
forte
into
a
melancholy
cadence
,
subsiding
,
at
the
end
of
the
last
word
,
into
a
sort
of
faint
resonance
,
like
the
lingering
vibrations
of
a
fine
violoncello
,
I
can
compare
to
nothing
for
its
strong
calm
melancholy
but
the
rush
and
cadence
of
the
wind
among
the
autumn
boughs
.
<EOS>
This
may
seem
a
strange
mode
of
speaking
about
the
reading
of
a
parish
clerk
 
a
man
in
rusty
spectacles
,
with
stubbly
hair
,
a
large
occiput
,
and
a
prominent
crown
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
Nature
's
way
:
she
will
allow
a
gentleman
of
splendid
physiognomy
and
poetic
aspirations
to
sing
woefully
out
of
tune
,
and
not
give
him
the
slightest
hint
of
it
;
and
takes
care
that
some
narrow
-
browed
fellow
,
trolling
a
ballad
in
the
corner
of
a
pot

house

shall
be
as
true
to
his
intervals
as
a

Joshua
himself
was
less
proud
of
his
reading
than
of
his
singing
,
and
it
was
always
with
a
sense
of
heightened
importance
that
he
passed
from
the
desk
to
the
choir
.
<EOS>
Still
more
to
-
day
:
it
was
a
special
occasion
,
for
an
old
man
,
familiar
to
all
the
parish
,
had
died
a
sad
death
 
not
in
his
bed
,
a
circumstance
the
most
painful
to
the
mind
of
the
peasant
 
and
now
the
funeral
psalm
was
to
be
sung
in
memory
of
his
sudden
departure
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Bartle
Massey
was
not
at
church
,
and
Joshua
's
importance
in
the
choir
suffered
no
eclipse
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
solemn
minor
strain
they
sang
.
<EOS>
The
old
psalm
-
tunes
have
many
a
wail
among
them
,
and
the
words
         
Thou
sweep'st
us
off
as
with
a
flood
;
     
We
vanish
hence
like
dreams
    
seemed
to
have
a
closer
application
than
usual
in
the
death
of
poor
Thias
.
<EOS>
The
mother
and
sons
listened
,
each
with
peculiar
feelings
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
had
a
vague
belief
that
the
psalm
was
doing
her
husband
good
;
it
was
part
of
that
decent
burial
which
she
would
have
thought
it
a
greater
wrong
to
withhold
from
him
than
to
have
caused
him
many
unhappy
days
while
he
was
living
.
<EOS>
The
more
there
was
said
about
her
husband
,
the
more
there
was
done
for
him
,
surely
the
safer
he
would
be
.
<EOS>
It
was
poor
Lisbeth
's
blind
way
of
feeling
that
human
love
and
pity
are
a
ground
of
faith
in
some
other
love
.
<EOS>
Seth
,
who
was
easily
touched
,
shed
tears
,
and
tried
to
recall
,
as
he
had
done
continually
since
his
father
's
death
,
all
that
he
had
heard
of
the
possibility
that
a
single
moment
of
consciousness
at
the
last
might
be
a
moment
of
pardon
and
reconcilement
;
for
was
it
not
written
in
the
very
psalm
they
were
singing
that
the
Divine
dealings
were
not
measured
and
circumscribed
by
time
?
<EOS>
Adam
had
never
been
unable
to
join
in
a
psalm
before
.
<EOS>
He
had
known
plenty
of
trouble
and
vexation
since
he
had
been
a
lad
,
but
this
was
the
first
sorrow
that
had
hemmed
in
his
voice
,
and
strangely
enough
it
was
sorrow
because
the
chief
source
of
his
past
trouble
and
vexation
was
for
ever
gone
out
of
his
reach
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
able
to
press
his
father
's
hand
before
their
parting
,
and
say
,
"
<EOS>
Father
,
you
know
it
was
all
right
between
us
;
I
never
forgot
what
I
owed
you
when
I
was
a
lad
<EOS>
;
you
forgive
me
if
I
have
been
too
hot
and
hasty
now
and
then
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
thought
but
<EOS>
little
to
-
day
of
the
hard
work
and
the
earnings
he
had
spent
on
his
father
:
his
thoughts
ran
constantly
on
what
the
old
man
's
feelings
had
been
in
moments
of
humiliation
,
when
he
had
held
down
his
head
before
the
rebukes
of
his
son
.
<EOS>
When
our
indignation
is
borne
in
submissive
silence
,
we
are
apt
to
feel
twinges
of
doubt
afterwards
as
to
our
own
generosity
,
if
not
justice
;
how
much
more
when
the
object
of
our
anger
has
gone
into
everlasting
silence
,
and
we
have
seen
his
face
for
the
last
time
in
the
meekness
of
death
!
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
was
always
too
hard
,
"
Adam
said
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
sore
fault
in
me
as
I
'm
so
hot
and
out
<EOS>
o
'
patience
with
people
when
they
do
wrong
,
and
my
heart
gets
shut
up
against
'em
,
so
as
I
ca
n't
bring
myself
to
forgive
'em
.
<EOS>
I
see
clear
enough
<EOS>
there
's
more
pride
nor
love
in
my
soul
,
for
I
could
sooner
make
a
thousand
strokes
with
th
'
hammer
for
my
father
than
bring
myself
to
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
there
went
plenty
o
'
pride
and
temper
to
the
strokes
,
as
the
devil
WILL
be
having
his
finger
in
what
we
call
our
duties
as
well
as
our
sins
.
<EOS>
Mayhap
the
best
thing
I
ever
did
in
my
life
was
only
doing
what
was
easiest
for
myself
.
<EOS>
It
's
allays
been
easier
for
me
to
work
nor
to
sit
still
,
but
the
real
tough
job
for
me
'
ud
be
to
master
my
own
will
and
temper
and
go
right
against
my
own
pride
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
now
,
if
I
was
to
find
Father
at
home
to
-
night
,
I
should
behave
different
;
but
there
's
no
knowing
 
<EOS>
perhaps
nothing
'
ud
be
a
lesson
to
us
if
it
did
n't
come
too
late
.
<EOS>
It
's
well
we
should
feel
as
life
's
a
reckoning
we
ca
n't
make
twice
over
;
there
's
no
real
making
amends
in
this
world
,
any
more
nor
you
can
mend
a
wrong
subtraction
by
doing
your
addition
right
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
key
-
note
to
which
Adam
's
thoughts
had
perpetually
returned
since
his
father
's
death
,
and
the
solemn
wail
of
the
funeral
psalm
was
only
an
influence
that
brought
back
the
old
thoughts
with
stronger
emphasis
.
<EOS>
So
was
the
sermon
,
which
Mr.
Irwine
had
chosen
with
reference
to
Thias
's
funeral
.
<EOS>
It
spoke
briefly
and
simply
of
the
words
,
"
In
the
midst
of
life
we
are
in
death
"
 
<EOS>
how
the
present
moment
is
all
we
can
call
our
own
for
works
of
mercy
,
of
righteous
dealing
,
and
of
family
tenderness
.
<EOS>
All
very
old
truths
 
but
<EOS>
what
we
thought
the
oldest
truth
becomes
the
most
startling
to
us
in
the
week
when
we
have
looked
on
the
dead
face
of
one
who
has
made
a
part
of
our
own
lives
.
<EOS>
For
when
men
want
to
impress
us
with
the
effect
of
a
new
and
wonderfully
vivid
light
,
do
they
not
let
it
fall
on
the
most
familiar
objects
,
that
we
may
measure
its
intensity
by
remembering
the
former
dimness
?
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
moment
of
the
final
blessing
,
when
the
forever
sublime
words
,
"
The
peace
of
God
,
which
passeth
all
understanding
,
"
seemed
to
blend
with
the
calm
afternoon
sunshine
that
fell
on
the
bowed
heads
of
the
congregation
;
and
then
the
quiet
rising
,
the
mothers
tying
on
the
bonnets
of
the
little
maidens
who
had
slept
through
the
sermon
,
the
fathers
collecting
the
prayer
-
books
,
until
all
streamed
out
through
the
old
archway
into
the
green
churchyard
and
began
their
neighbourly
talk
,
their
simple
civilities
,
and
their
invitations
to
tea
;
for
on
a
Sunday
every
one
was
ready
to
receive
a
guest
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
day
when
all
must
be
in
their
best
clothes
and
their
best
humour
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
paused
a
minute
at
the
church
gate
:
they
were
waiting
for
Adam
to
come
up
,
not
being
contented
to
go
away
without
saying
a
kind
word
to
the
widow
and
her
sons
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mrs.
Bede
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
they
walked
on
together
,
"
you
must
keep
up
your
heart
;
husbands
and
wives
must
be
content
when
they
've
lived
to
rear
their
children
and
see
one
another
's
hair
grey
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
"
they
wonna
have
long
to
wait
for
one
another
then
,
anyhow
.
<EOS>
And
ye've
got
two
o
'
<EOS>
the
strapping'st
sons
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
country
;
<EOS>
and
well
you
may
,
for
I
remember
poor
Thias
as
fine
a
broad
-
shouldered
fellow
as
need
to
be
;
and
as
for
you
,
Mrs.
Bede
,
why
you
're
straighter
<EOS>
i
'
the
back
nor
half
the
young
women
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
"
said
Lisbeth
,
"
it
's
poor
luck
for
the
platter
to
wear
well
<EOS>
when
it
's
broke
<EOS>
i
'
two

<EOS>
The
sooner
I
'm
laid
under
the
thorn
the
better
.
<EOS>
I
'm
no
good
to
nobody
now

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
never
took
notice
of
his
mother
's
little
unjust
plaints
;
but
Seth
said
,
"
Nay
,
Mother
,
thee
mustna
say
so
.
<EOS>
Thy
sons
'
ull
never
get
another
mother

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
lad
,
that
's
true
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
"
and
it
's
wrong
on
us
to
give
way
to
grief
,
Mrs.
Bede
;
for
it
's
like
the
children
cryin
'
when
the
fathers
and
mothers
take
things
from
'em

<EOS>
There
's
One
above
knows
better

us

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah

said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
an

it

work

settin

<EOS>
We
shall

It

but
<EOS>
little
good
<EOS>

'll
do
a

watering
the
last
year
's
crop
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
,
Adam
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
feeling
that
his
wife
's
words
were
,
as
usual
,
rather
incisive
than
soothing
,
and
that
it
would
be
well
to
change
the
subject
<EOS>
,
"
you
'll
come
and
see
us
again
now
,
I
hope
.
<EOS>
I
hanna
had
a
talk
with
you
this
long
while
,
and
the
missis
here
wants
you
to
see
what
can
be
done
with
her
best
spinning
-
wheel
,
for
it
's
got
broke
,
and
it
'll
be
a
nice
job
to
mend
it
 
<EOS>
there
'll
want
a
bit
o
'
turning
.
<EOS>
You
'll
come
as
soon
as
you
can
now
,
will
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
paused
and
looked
round
while
he
was
speaking
,
as
if
to
see
where
Hetty
was
;
for
the
children
were
running
on
before
.
<EOS>
Hetty
was
not
without
a
companion
,
and
she
had
,
besides
,
more
pink
and
white
about
her
than
ever
,
for
she
held
in
her
hand
<EOS>
the
wonderful
pink
-
and
-
white
hot
-
house
plant
,
with
a
very
long
name
 
a
Scotch
name
<EOS>
,
she
supposed
,
since
people
said
Mr.
Craig
the
gardener
was
Scotch
.
<EOS>
Adam
took
the
opportunity
of
looking
round
too
;
and
I
am
sure
you
will
not
require
of
him
that
he
should
feel
any
vexation
in
observing
a
pouting
expression
on
Hetty
's
face
as
she
listened
to
the
gardener
's
small
talk
.
<EOS>
Yet
in
her
secret
heart
she
was
glad
to
have
him
by
her
side
,
for
she
would
perhaps
learn
from
him
how
it
was
Arthur
<EOS>
had
not
come
to
church
.
<EOS>
Not
that
she
cared
to
ask
him
the
question
,
but
she
hoped
the
information
would
be
given
spontaneously
;
for
Mr.
Craig
,
like
a
superior
man
,
was
very
fond
of
giving
information
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
was
never
aware
that
his
conversation
and
advances
were
received
coldly
,
for
to
shift
one
's
point
of
view
beyond
certain
limits
is
impossible
to
the
most
liberal
and
expansive
mind
;
we
are
none
of
us
aware
of
the
impression
we
produce
on
Brazilian
monkeys
of
feeble
understanding
 
<EOS>
it
is
possible
they
see
hardly
anything
in
us
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Mr.
Craig
was
a
man
of
sober
passions
,
and
was
already
in
his
tenth
year
of
hesitation
as
to
the
relative
advantages
of
matrimony
and
bachelorhood
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
,
now
and
then
,
when
he
had
been
a
little
heated
by
an
extra
glass
of
grog
,
he
had
been
heard
to
say
of
Hetty
that
the
"
lass
was
well
enough
,
"
and
that
"
a
man
might
do
worse
"
;
but
on
convivial
occasions
men
are
apt
to
express
themselves
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
held
Mr.
Craig
in
honour
,
as
a
man
who
"
knew
his
business
"
and
who
had
great
lights
concerning
soils
and
compost
;
but
he
was
less
of
a
favourite
with
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
had
more
than
once
said
in
confidence
to
her
husband
,
"
You
're
mighty
fond
o
'
Craig
,
but
for
my
part
,
I
think
he
's
welly
like
a
cock
as
thinks
the
sun
's
rose
o
'
purpose
to
hear
him
crow
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
rest
,
Mr.
Craig
was
an
estimable
gardener
,
and
was
not
without
reasons
for
having
a
high
opinion
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
also
high
shoulders
and
high
cheek
-
bones
and
hung
his
head
forward
a
little
,
as
he
walked
along
with
his
hands
in
his
breeches
pockets
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
was
his
pedigree
only
that
had
the
advantage
of
being
Scotch
,
and
not
his
"
bringing
up
"
;
for
except
that
he
had
a
stronger
burr
in
his
accent
,
his
speech
differed
little
from
that
of
the
Loamshire
people
about
him
.
<EOS>
But
a
gardener
is
Scotch
,
as
a
French
teacher
is
Parisian
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
he
said
,
before
the
good
slow
farmer
had
time
to
speak
,
"
ye'll
not
be
carrying
your
hay
to
-
morrow
,
I
'm
thinking
.
<EOS>
The
glass
sticks
at
"
change

"
and
ye
may
rely
upo
'
<EOS>
my
word
as
we
'll
ha
'
more
downfall
afore
twenty
-
four
hours

past

<EOS>
Ye
see
that
darkish
-
blue
cloud
there
upo
'
<EOS>
the
'
rizon
 
ye
know
what
I
mean
by
the
'
rizon
,
where
the
land
and
sky
seems
to
meet
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
I
see
the
cloud
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
'
rizon
or
no
'
rizon
.
<EOS>
It
's
right
<EOS>
o'er
<EOS>
Mike
Holdsworth
's
fallow
,
and
a
foul
fallow
it
is
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
you
mark
my
words
,
as
that
cloud
'
ull
spread
<EOS>
o'er

the

pretty
nigh
as
quick
as
you
'd

ricks

<EOS>
It
's
a

Th

there
's
a

o

things

<EOS>
How
do
ye
do

Mistress
Bede

"
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
continued
,
without
a
pause
,
nodding
by
the
way
to
Adam
and
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
y
'
enjoyed

gooseberries

<EOS>
If

<EOS>
It

<EOS>
I

<EOS>
"
  
"
They
look
pretty
fur
,
though
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
and
speaking
in
rather
a
subdued
reverential
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
could
come
truer
nor
that
pictur
o
'
the

the

that

was
made

Why

"
  
<EOS>
"
Pee

"
said
Mr.
Craig
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
doesna
want
to
see

know

English

<EOS>
Why

I

a

five

<EOS>
I
knew
a
man
as
his

<EOS>
I
should
like
to
know
what
them
<EOS>
grasshoppers
are
to
do
against
such
fine
fellows
as
our
young
Captain
Arthur

<EOS>
Why
,
it
'
ud
astonish
a
Frenchman
only
to
look
at
him
;
his
arm
's
thicker
nor
a
Frenchman

I
'll
be

for
they

"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
IS
the
captain
,
as
he
wasna
at
church
to
-
day
?
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
talking
to
him
o
'
Friday
,
and
he
said
nothing
about
his
going
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
's
only
gone
to
Eagledale
for
a
bit
o
'
fishing
;
I
reckon
he
'll
be
back
again
afore
many
days
are
o'er
,
for
he
's
to
be
at
all
th
'

preparing

o
'
<EOS>
age
o

<EOS>
the
30th
o
'
<EOS>
July
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
<EOS>
fond
o
'
getting
away
for
a
bit
,
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
Him
and
th
'
old
squire
fit
one
another
like
frost
and
flowers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
smiled
and
winked
slowly
as
he
made
this
last
observation
,
but
the
subject
was
not
developed
farther
,
for
now
they
had
reached
the
turning
in
the
road
where
Adam
and
his
companions
must
say
"
good
-
bye
.
"
<EOS>
The
gardener
,
too
,
would
have
had
to
turn
off
in
the
same
direction
if
he
had
not
accepted
Mr.
Poyser
's
invitation
to
tea
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
duly
seconded
the
invitation
,
for
she
would
have
held
it
a
deep
disgrace
not
to
make
her
neighbours
welcome
to
her
house
:
personal
likes
and
dislikes
must
not
interfere
with
that
sacred
custom
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
Mr.
Craig
had
always
been
full
of
civilities
to
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
was
scrupulous
in
declaring
that
she
had
"
nothing
to
say
again
'
him
,
on'y
<EOS>
it
was
a
pity
he
couldna
be
hatched
o'er
again
,
an
'
hatched
different
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
Adam
and
Seth
,
with
their
mother
between
them
,
wound
their
way
down
to
the
valley
and
up
again
to
the
old
house
,
where
a
saddened
memory
had
taken
the
place
of
a
long
,
long
anxiety
 
where
Adam
would
never
have
to
ask
again
as
he
entered
,
"
Where
's
Father
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
the
other
family
party
,
with
Mr.
Craig
for
company
,
went
back
to
the
pleasant
bright
house
-
place
at
the
Hall
Farm
 
all
with
quiet
minds
,
except
Hetty
,
who
knew
now
where
Arthur
was
gone
,
but
was
only
the
more
puzzled
and
uneasy
.
<EOS>
For
it
appeared
that
his
absence
was
quite
voluntary
;
he
need
not
have
gone
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
have
gone
if
he
had
wanted
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
sickening
sense
that
no
lot
could
ever
be
pleasant
to
her
again
if
her
Thursday
night
's
vision
was
not
to
be
fulfilled
;
and
in
this
moment
of
chill
,
bare
,
wintry
disappointment
and
doubt
,
she
looked
towards
the
possibility
of
being
with
Arthur
again
,
of
meeting
his
loving
glance
,
and
hearing
his
soft
words
with
that
eager
yearning
which
one
may
call
the
"
growing
pain
"
of
passion
.
    
<EOS>
Adam
on
a
Working
Day
  
<EOS>
NOTWITHSTANDING
Mr.
Craig
's
prophecy
,
the
dark
-
blue
cloud
dispersed
itself
without
having
produced
the
threatened
consequences
.
<EOS>
"
The
weather
"
 
as
he
observed
the
next
morning
 
<EOS>
"
the
weather
,
you
see
,
's
a
ticklish
thing
,
an
'
a
fool
'
ull
hit
on't
sometimes
when
a
wise
man
misses
;
that
's
why
the
almanecks
get
so
much
credit
.
<EOS>
It
's
<EOS>
one
o
'
them
chancy
things
as
fools
thrive
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
unreasonable
behaviour
of
the
weather
,
however
,
could
displease
no
one
else
in
Hayslope
besides
Mr.
Craig
.
<EOS>
All
hands
were
to
be
out
in
the
meadows
this
morning
as
soon
as
the
dew
had
risen
;
the
wives
and
daughters
did
double
work
in
every
farmhouse
,
that
the
maids
might
give
their
help
in
tossing
the
hay
;
and
when
Adam
was
marching
along
the
lanes
,
with
his
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
,
he
caught
the
sound
of
jocose
talk
and
ringing
laughter
from
behind
the
hedges
.
<EOS>
The
jocose
talk
of
hay
-
makers
is
best
at
a
distance
;
like
those
clumsy
bells
round
the
cows
'
necks
,
it
has
rather
a
coarse
sound
when
it
comes
close
,
and
may
even
grate
on
your
ears
painfully
;
but
heard
from
far
off
,
it
mingles
very
prettily
with
the
other
joyous
sounds
of
nature
.
<EOS>
Men
's
muscles
move
better
when
their
souls
are
making
merry
music
,
though
their
merriment
is
of
a
poor
blundering
sort
,
not
at
all
like
the
merriment
of
birds
.
  
<EOS>
And
perhaps
there
is
no
time
in
a
summer
's
day
more
cheering
than
when
the
warmth
of
the
sun
is
just
beginning
to
triumph
over
the
freshness
of
the
morning
 
<EOS>
when
there
is
just
a
lingering
hint
of
early
coolness
to
keep
off
languor
under
the
delicious
influence
of
warmth
.
<EOS>
The
reason
Adam
was
walking
along
the
lanes
at
this
time
was
because
his
work
for
the
rest
of
the
day
lay
at
a
country
-
house
about
three
miles
off
,
which
was
being
put
in
repair
for
the
son
of
a
neighbouring
squire
;
and
he
had
been
busy
since
early
morning
with
the
packing
of
panels
,
doors
,
and
chimney
-
pieces
,
in
a
waggon
which
was
now
gone
on
before
him
,
while
Jonathan
Burge
himself
had
ridden
to
the
spot
on
horseback
,
to
await
its
arrival
and
direct
the
workmen
.
  
<EOS>
This
little
walk
was
a
rest
to
Adam
,
and
he
was
unconsciously
under
the
charm
of
the
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
summer
morning
in
his
heart
,
and
he
saw
Hetty
in
the
sunshine
 
a
sunshine
without
glare
,
with
slanting
rays
that
tremble
between
the
delicate
shadows
of
the
leaves
.
<EOS>
He
thought
,
yesterday
when
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
as
they
came
out
of
church
,
that
there
was
a
touch
of
melancholy
kindness
in
her
face
,
such
as
he
had
not
seen
before
,
and
he
took
it
as
a
sign
that
she
had
some
sympathy
with
his
family
trouble
.
<EOS>
Poor
fellow
!
<EOS>
That
touch
of
melancholy
came
from
quite
another
source
,
but
how
was
he
to
know
?
<EOS>
We
look
at
the
one
little
woman
's
face
we
love
as
we
look
at
the
face
of
our
mother
earth
,
and
see
all
sorts
of
answers
to
our
own
yearnings
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
Adam
not
to
feel
that
what
had
happened
in
the
last
week
had
brought
the
prospect
of
marriage
nearer
to
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
he
had
felt
keenly
the
danger
that
some
other
man
might
step
in
and
get
possession
of
Hetty
's
heart
and
hand
,
while
he
himself
was
still
in
a
position
that
made
him
shrink
from
asking
her
to
accept
him
.
<EOS>
Even
if
he
had
had
a
strong
hope
that
she
was
fond
of
him
 
and
his
hope
was
far
from
being
strong
 
<EOS>
he
had
been
too
heavily
burdened
with
other
claims
to
provide
a
home
for
himself
and
Hetty
 
<EOS>
a
home
such
as
he
could
expect
her
to
be
content
with
after
the
comfort
and
plenty
of
the
Farm
.
<EOS>
Like
all
strong
natures
,
Adam
had
confidence
in
his
ability
to
achieve
something
in
the
future
;
he
felt
sure
he
should
some
day
,
if
he
lived
,
be
able
to
maintain
a
family
and
make
a
good
broad
path
for
himself
;
but
he
had
too
cool
a
head
not
to
estimate
to
the
full
the
obstacles
that
were
to
be
overcome
.
<EOS>
And
the
time
would
be
so
long
!
<EOS>
And
there
was
Hetty
,
like
a
bright
-
cheeked
apple
hanging
over
the
orchard
wall
,
within
sight
of
everybody
,
and
everybody
must
long
for
her
!
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
if
she
loved
him
very
much
,
she
would
be
content
to
wait
for
him
:
but
DID
she
love
him
?
<EOS>
His
hopes
had
never
risen
so
high
that
he
had
dared
to
ask
her
.
<EOS>
He
was
clear
-
sighted
enough
to
be
aware
that
her
uncle
and
aunt
would
have
looked
kindly
on
his
suit
,
and
indeed
,
without
this
encouragement
he
would
never
have
persevered
in
going
to
the
Farm
;
but
it
was
impossible
to
come
to
any
but
fluctuating
conclusions
about
Hetty
's
feelings
.
<EOS>
She
was
like
a
kitten
,
and
had
the
same
distractingly
pretty
looks
,
that
meant
nothing
,
for
everybody
that
came
near
her
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
he
could
not
help
saying
to
himself
that
the
heaviest
part
of
his
burden
was
removed
,
and
that
even
before
the
end
of
another
year
his
circumstances
might
be
brought
into
a
shape
that
would
allow
him
to
think
of
marrying
.
<EOS>
It
would
always
be
a
hard
struggle
with
his
mother
,
he
knew
:
she
would
be
jealous
of
any
wife
he
might
choose
,
and
she
had
set
her
mind
especially
against
Hetty
 
perhaps
for
no
other
reason
than
that
she
suspected
Hetty
to
be
the
woman
he
HAD
chosen
.
<EOS>
It
would
never
do
,
he
feared
,
for
his
mother
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
when
he
was
married
;
and
yet
how
hard
she
would
think
it
if
he
asked
her
to
leave
him
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
pain
to
be
gone
through
with
his
mother
,
but
it
was
a
case
in
which
he
must
make
her
feel
that
his
will
was
strong
 
it
would
be
better
for
her
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
For
himself
,
he
would
have
liked
that
they
should
all
live
together
till
Seth
was
married
,
and
they
might
have
built
a
bit
themselves
to
the
old
house
,
and
made
more
room
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
like
"
to
part
wi
'
th
'
lad
"
:
they
had
hardly
every
been
separated
for
more
than
a
day
since
they
were
born
.
  
<EOS>
But
Adam
had
no
sooner
caught
his
imagination
leaping
forward
in
this
way
 
making
arrangements
for
an
uncertain
future
 
than
he
checked
himself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
pretty
building
I
'm
making
,
without
either
bricks
or
timber
.
<EOS>
I
'm
up
<EOS>
i
'
the
garret
a'ready
,
and
have
n't
so
much
as
dug
the
foundation
.
<EOS>
"
Whenever
Adam
was
strongly
convinced
of
any
proposition
,
it
took
the
form
of
a
principle
in
his
mind
:
it
was
knowledge
to
be
acted
on
,
as
much
as
the
knowledge
that
damp
will
cause
rust
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
here
lay
the
secret
of
the
hardness
he
had
accused
himself
of
:
he
had
too
little
fellow
-
feeling
with
the
weakness
that
errs
in
spite
of
foreseen
consequences
.
<EOS>
Without
this
fellow
-
feeling
,
how
are
we
to
get
enough
patience
and
charity
towards
our
stumbling
,
falling
companions
in
the
long
and
changeful
journey
?
<EOS>
And
there
is
but
one
way
in
which
a
strong
determined
soul
can
learn
it
 
by
getting
his
heart
-
strings
bound
round
the
weak
and
erring
,
so
that
he
must
share
not
only
the
outward
consequence
of
their
error
,
but
their
inward
suffering
.
<EOS>
That
is
a
long
and
hard
lesson
,
and
Adam
had
at
present
only
learned
the
alphabet
of
it
in
his
father
's
sudden
death
,
which
,
by
annihilating
in
an
instant
all
that
had
stimulated
his
indignation
,
had
sent
a
sudden
rush
of
thought
and
memory
over
what
had
claimed
his
pity
and
tenderness
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
Adam
's
strength
,
not
its
correlative
hardness
,
that
influenced
his
meditations
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
had
long
made
up
his
mind
that
it
would
be
wrong
as
well
as
foolish
for
him
to
marry
a
blooming
young
girl
,
so
long
as
he
had
no
other
prospect
than
that
of
growing
poverty
with
a
growing
family
.
<EOS>
And
his
savings
had
been
so
constantly
drawn
upon
(
besides
the
terrible
sweep
of
paying
for
Seth
's
substitute
in
the
militia
)
that
he
had
not
enough
money
beforehand
to
furnish
even
a
small
cottage
,
and
keep
something
in
reserve
against
a
rainy
day
.
<EOS>
He
had
good
hope
that
he
should
be
"
firmer
on
his
legs
"
by
and
by
;
but
he
could
not
be
satisfied
with
a
vague
confidence
in
his
arm
and
brain
;
he
must
have
definite
plans
,
and
set
about
them
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
partnership
with
Jonathan
Burge
was
not
to
be
thought
of
at
present
 
there
were
things
implicitly
tacked
to
it
that
he
could
not
accept
;
but
Adam
thought
that
he
and
Seth
might
carry
on
a
little
business
for
themselves
in
addition
to
their
journeyman
's
work
,
by
buying
a
small
stock
of
superior
wood
and
making
articles
of
household
furniture
,
for
which
Adam
had
no
end
of
contrivances
.
<EOS>
Seth
might
gain
more
by
working
at
separate
jobs
under
Adam
's
direction
than
by
his
journeyman
's
work
,
and
Adam
,
in
his
overhours
,
could
do
all
the
"
nice
"
work
that
required
peculiar
skill
.
<EOS>
The
money
gained
in
this
way
,
with
the
good
wages
he
received
as
foreman
,
would
soon
enable
them
to
get
beforehand
with
the
world
,
so
sparingly
as
they
would
all
live
now
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
this
little
plan
shaped
itself
in
his
mind
than
he
began
to
be
busy
with
exact
calculations
about
the
wood
to
be
bought
and
the
particular
article
of
furniture
that
should
be
undertaken
first
 
a
kitchen
cupboard
of
his
own
contrivance
,
with
such
an
ingenious
arrangement
of
sliding
-
doors
and
bolts
,
such
convenient
nooks
for
stowing
household
provender
,
and
such
a
symmetrical
result
to
the
eye
,
that
every
good
housewife
would
be
in
raptures
with
it
,
and
fall
through
all
the
gradations
of
melancholy
longing
till
her
husband
promised
to
buy
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
Adam
pictured
to
himself
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
examining
it
with
her
keen
eye
and
trying
in
vain
to
find
out
a
deficiency
;
and
,
of
course
,
close
to
Mrs.
Poyser
stood
Hetty
,
and
Adam
was
again
beguiled
from
calculations
and
contrivances
into
dreams
and
hopes
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
would
go
and
see
her
this
evening
 
<EOS>
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
been
at
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
liked
to
go
to
the
night
-
school
,
to
see
why
Bartle
Massey
had
not
been
at
church
yesterday
,
for
he
feared
his
old
friend
was
ill
;
but
,
unless
he
could
manage
both
visits
,
this
last
must
be
put
off
till
to
-
morrow
 
the
desire
to
be
near
Hetty
and
to
speak
to
her
again
was
too
strong
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
made
up
his
mind
to
this
,
he
was
coming
very
near
to
the
end
of
his
walk
,
within
the
sound
of
the
hammers
at
work
on
the
refitting
of
the
old
house
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
tools
to
a
clever
workman
who
loves
his
work
is
like
the
tentative
sounds
of
the
orchestra
to
the
violinist
who
has
to
bear
his
part
in
the
overture
:
the
strong
fibres
begin
their
accustomed
thrill
,
and
what
was
a
moment
before
joy
,
vexation
,
or
ambition
,
begins
its
change
into
energy
.
<EOS>
All
passion
becomes
strength
when
it
has
an
outlet
from
the
narrow
limits
of
our
personal
lot
in
the
labour
of
our
right
arm
,
the
cunning
of
our
right
hand
,
or
the
still
,
creative
activity
of
our
thought
.
<EOS>
Look
at
Adam
through
the
rest
of
the
day
,
as
he
stands
on
the
scaffolding
with
the
two
-
feet
ruler
in
his
hand
,
whistling
low
while
he
considers
how
a
difficulty
about
a
floor
-
joist
or
a
window
-
frame
is
to
be
overcome
;
or
as
he
pushes
one
of
the
younger
workmen
aside
and
takes
his
place
in
upheaving
a
weight
of
timber
,
saying
,
"
Let
alone
,
lad
!
<EOS>
Thee'st
got
too
much
gristle
<EOS>
i
'
thy
bones
yet
"
;
or
as
he
fixes
his
keen
black
eyes
on
the
motions
of
a
workman
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
and
warns
him
that
his
distances
are
not
right
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
broad
-
shouldered
man
with
the
bare
muscular
arms
,
and
the
thick
,
firm
,
black
hair
tossed
about
like
trodden
meadow
-
grass
whenever
he
takes
off
his
paper
cap
,
and
with
the
strong
barytone
voice
bursting
every
now
and
then
into
loud
and
solemn
psalm
-
tunes
,
as
if
seeking
an
outlet
for
superfluous
strength
,
yet
presently
checking
himself
,
apparently
crossed
by
some
thought
which
jars
with
the
singing
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
if
you
had
not
been
already
in
the
secret
,
you
might
not
have
guessed
what
sad
memories
<EOS>
what
warm
affection
,
<EOS>
what
tender
fluttering
hopes
,
had
their
home
in
this
athletic
body
with
the
broken
finger
-
nails
 
in
this
rough
man
,
who
knew
no
better
lyrics
than
he
could
find
in
the
Old
and
New
Version
and
an
occasional
hymn
;
who
knew
the
smallest
possible
amount
of
profane
history
;
and
for
whom
the
motion
and
shape
of
the
earth
,
the
course
of
the
sun
,
and
the
changes
of
the
seasons
lay
in
the
region
of
mystery
just
made
visible
by
fragmentary
knowledge
.
<EOS>
It
had
cost
Adam
a
great
deal
of
trouble
and
work
in
overhours
to
know
what
he
knew
over
and
above
the
secrets
of
his
handicraft
,
and
that
acquaintance
with
mechanics
and
figures
,
and
the
nature
of
the
materials
he
worked
with
,
which
was
made
easy
to
him
by
inborn
inherited
faculty
 
to
get
the
mastery
of
his
pen
,
and
write
a
plain
hand
,
to
spell
without
any
other
mistakes
than
must
in
fairness
be
attributed
to
the
unreasonable
character
of
orthography
rather
than
to
any
deficiency
in
the
speller
,
and
,
moreover
,
to
learn
his
musical
notes
and
part
-
singing
.
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
he
had
read
his
Bible
,
including
the
apocryphal
books
;
Poor
Richard
's
Almanac
,
Taylor
's
Holy
Living
and
Dying
,
The
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
with
Bunyan
's
Life
and
Holy
War
,
a
great
deal
of
Bailey
's
Dictionary
,
Valentine
and
Orson
,
and
part
of
a
History
of
Babylon
,
which
Bartle
Massey
had
lent
him
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
had
many
more
books
from
Bartle
Massey
,
but
he
had
no
time
for
reading
"
the
commin
print
,
"
as
Lisbeth
called
it
,
so
busy
as
he
was
with
figures
in
all
the
leisure
moments
which
he
did
not
fill
up
with
extra
carpentry
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
you
perceive
,
was
by
no
means
a
marvellous
man
,
nor
,
properly
speaking
,
a
genius
,
yet
I
will
not
pretend
that
his
was
an
ordinary
character
among
workmen
;
and
it
would
not
be
at
all
a
safe
conclusion
that
the
next
best
man
you
may
happen
to
see
with
a
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
and
a
paper
cap
on
his
head
has
the
strong
conscience
and
the
strong
sense
,
the
blended
susceptibility
and
self
-
command
,
of
our
friend
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
an
average
man
.
<EOS>
Yet
such
men
as
he
are
reared
here
and
there
in
every
generation
of
our
peasant
artisans
 
with
an
inheritance
of
affections
nurtured
by
a
simple
family
life
of
common
need
and
common
industry
,
and
an
inheritance
of
faculties
trained
in
skilful
courageous
labour
:
they
make
their
way
upwards
,
rarely
as
geniuses
,
most
commonly
as
painstaking
honest
men
,
with
the
skill
and
conscience
to
do
well
<EOS>
the
tasks
that
lie
before
them
.
<EOS>
Their
lives
have
no
discernible
echo
beyond
the
neighbourhood
where
they
dwelt
,
but
you
are
almost
sure
to
find
there
some
good
piece
of
road
,
some
building
,
some
application
of
mineral
produce
,
some
improvement
in
farming
practice
,
some
reform
of
parish
abuses
,
with
which
their
names
are
associated
by
one
or
two
generations
after
them
.
<EOS>
Their
employers
were
the
richer
for
them
,
the
work
of
their
hands
has
worn
well
,
and
the
work
of
their
brains
has
guided
well
the
hands
of
other
men
.
<EOS>
They
went
about
in
their
youth
in
flannel
or
paper
caps
,
in
coats
black
with
coal
-
dust
or
streaked
with
lime
and
red
paint
;
in
old
age
their
white
hairs
are
seen
in
a
place
of
honour
at
church
and
at
market
,
and
they
tell
their
well
-
dressed
sons
and
daughters
,
seated
round
the
bright
hearth
on
winter
evenings
,
how
pleased
they
were
when
they
first
earned
their
twopence
a
-
day
.
<EOS>
Others
there
are
who
die
poor
and
never
put
off
the
workman
's
coal
on
weekdays
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
had
the
art
of
getting
rich
,
but
they
are
men
of
trust
,
and
when
they
die
before
the
work
is
all
out
of
them
,
it
is
as
if
some
main
screw
had
got
loose
in
a
machine
;
the
master
who
employed
them
says
,
"
Where
shall
I
find
their
like
?

Adam
Visits
the
Hall
Farm
  
ADAM
came
back
from
his
work
in
the
empty
waggon
 
<EOS>
that
was
why
he
had
changed
his
clothes
 
and
was
ready
to
set
out
to
the
Hall
Farm
when
it
still
wanted
a
quarter
to
seven
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
thee

said
Lisbeth
complainingly
,
as

came
downstairs

<EOS>
"

"
No

said
Adam
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
I

"
  
<EOS>
"
Good

,
mother
<EOS>
,
I
ca
n't
stay

"
said
Adam
,
putting
on
his
hat
and
going
out
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
sooner
gone
a
few
paces
beyond
the
door
than
Lisbeth
became
uneasy
at
the
thought
that
she
had
vexed
him
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
secret
of
her
objection
to
the
best
clothes
was
her
suspicion
that
they
were
put
on
for
Hetty
's
sake
;
but
deeper
than
all
her
peevishness
lay
the
need
that
her
son
should
love
her
.
<EOS>
She
hurried
after
him
,
and
laid
hold
of
his
arm
before
he
had
got
half
-
way
down
to
the
brook
,
and
said
,
"
Nay
,
my
lad
,
thee
wutna
go
away
angered
wi
'
<EOS>
thy
mother
,
an
'
her

to

an
'
think
on
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
Mother
,
"
said
Adam
,
gravely
,
and
standing
still
while
he
put
his
arm
on
her
shoulder
,
"
I
'm
not
angered
.
<EOS>
But
I
wish
,
for
thy

sake
<EOS>
,
thee'dst
be
more
contented
to
let

do
what
I

<EOS>
I
'll
never
be
no
other
than
a
good
son
to
thee
as
long
as
we
live
.
<EOS>
But
a
man
has
other
feelings
besides
what
he
owes
to
's
father
and
mother
,
and
thee
oughtna
to
want
to
rule
over
me
body
and
soul

<EOS>
And
thee
must
make
up
thy
mind
as
I
'll
not
give
way
to
thee
where
I
've
a
right
to
do
what
I

<EOS>
So
let
us
have
no
more
words
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
"
said
Lisbeth
,
not
willing
to
show
that
she
felt
the
real
bearing
of
Adam
's
words
,
"
and
'

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
;
good

"
said
Adam
,
kissing
her
and
hurrying
away
.
<EOS>
He
saw
there
was
no
other
means
of
putting
an
end
to
the
dialogue
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
stood
still
on
the
spot
,
shading
her
eyes
and
looking
after
him
till
he
was
quite
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
She
felt
to
the
full
all
the
meaning
that
had
lain
in
Adam
's
words
,
and
,
as
she
lost
sight
of
him
and
turned
back
slowly
into
the
house
,
she
said
aloud
to
herself
 
for
it
was
her
way
to
speak
her
thoughts
aloud
in
the
long
days
when
her
husband
and
sons
were
at
their
work
 
<EOS>

Adam
walked
so
fast
that
he
was
at
the
yard
-
gate
before
seven
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
and
the
grandfather
were
not
yet
come
in
from
the
meadow
:
every
one
was
in
the
meadow
,
even
to
the
black
-
and
-
tan
terrier
 
<EOS>
no
one
kept
watch
in
the
yard
but
the
bull
-
dog
;
and
when
Adam
reached
the
house
-
door
,
which
stood
wide
open
,
he
saw
there
was
no
one
in
the
bright
clean
house
-
place
.
<EOS>
But
he
guessed
where
Mrs.
Poyser
and
some
one
else
would
be
,
quite
within
hearing
;
so
he
knocked
on
the
door
and
said
in
his
strong
voice
,
"
Mrs.
Poyser
within
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Mr.
Bede
,
come
in
,
"
Mrs.
Poyser
called
out
from
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
She
always
gave
Adam
this
title
when
she
received
him
in
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
come
into
the
dairy
if
you
will
,
for
I
canna
justly
leave
the
cheese
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
walked
into
the
dairy
,
where
Mrs.
Poyser
and
Nancy
were
crushing
the
first
evening
cheese
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
might
think
you
war
come
to
a
dead
-
house
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
he
stood
in
the
open
doorway
;
"
they
're
all
i
'
the
meadow
;
but
Martin
's
sure
to
be
in
afore
long
,
for
they

leaving
the
hay
cocked
to

ready

<EOS>

count
as
Hetty

the

just

<EOS>
An
'
there
's
no

the
children
to
gether
it

for
they
put
more

basket

you
might
as
well
set
the
wasps
to
gether
the
fruit

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
longed
to
say
he
would
go
into
the
garden
till
Mr.
Poyser
came
in
,
but
he
was
not
quite
courageous
enough
,
so
he
said
,
"
I
could
be
looking
at
your
spinning
-
wheel
,
then
,
and
see
what
wants
doing
to
it
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
stands
in
the
house
,
where
I
can
find
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
've
put
it
away
in
the
right
-
hand
parlour
;
but
let
it
be
till
I
can
fetch
it
and
show
it
you
.
<EOS>
I
'd
be
glad
now
if
you
'd
go
into
the
garden
and
tell
Hetty
to
send
Totty
in

<EOS>
The
child
'
ull
run
in
if
she
's
told
,
an
'
I

Hetty

<EOS>
I
'll
be
much
obliged
to
you

Mr.
Bede

if
you
'll
go

beautiful

But
you

a

<EOS>
"
Thank

said
Adam

"
a

I

rather

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

aye

"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
reaching
a
small
white
basin
that
stood
on
the
shelf
,
and
dipping
it
into
the
whey
-
tub
,
"
the
smell
o
'
bread
's
sweet

everybody

the

<EOS>
The
Miss
Irwines
allays
say
,
"
Oh

I
envy

<EOS>
An
'
I

,
"
Yes

<EOS>
"
  
"
Why
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
you
would
n't
like
to
live
anywhere
else
<EOS>
but
in
a
farm
-
house
,
so
well
as
you
manage
it
,
"
said
Adam
,
taking
the
basin
;
"
and
there
can
be
nothing
to
look
at
pleasanter
nor
a
fine
milch
cow
,
standing
up
to'ts
knees
in
pasture
,
and
the
new
milk
frothing
in
the
pail
,
and
the
fresh
butter
ready
for
market

and
the
calves
,
and
the
poultry
.
<EOS>
Here
's
to
your
health
,
and
may
you
allays
have
strength
to
look
after
your
own
dairy
,
and
set
a
pattern
t
'
all
the
farmers
'
wives
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
was
not
to
be
caught
in
the
weakness
of
smiling
at
a
compliment
,
but
a
quiet
complacency
over
-
spread
her
face
like
a
stealing
sunbeam
,
and
gave
a
milder
glance
than
usual
to
her
blue
-
grey
eyes
,
as
she
looked
at
Adam
drinking
the
whey
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
think
I
taste
that
whey
now
 
with
a
flavour
<EOS>
so
delicate
that
one
can
hardly
distinguish
it
from
an
odour
,
and
with
that
soft
gliding
warmth
that
fills
one
's
imagination
with
a
still
,
happy
dreaminess
.
<EOS>
And
the
light
music
of
the
dropping
whey
is
in
my
ears
,
mingling
with
the
twittering
of
a
bird
outside
the
wire
network
window
 
the
window
overlooking
the
garden
,
and
shaded
by
tall
Guelder
roses
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
a
little
more
,
Mr.
Bede
?
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
Adam
set
down
the
basin
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
;
I
'll
go
into
the
garden
now
,
and
send
in
the
little
lass
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
do
;
and
tell
her
to
come
to
her
mother
in
the
dairy
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
walked
round
by
the
rick
-
yard
,
at
present
empty
of
ricks
,
to
the
little
wooden
gate
leading
into
the
garden
 
once
the
well
-
tended
kitchen
-
garden
of
a
manor
-
house
;
now
,
but
for
the
handsome
brick
wall
with
stone
coping
that
ran
along
one
side
of
it
,
a
true
farmhouse
garden
,
with
hardy
perennial
flowers
,
unpruned
fruit
-
trees
,
and
kitchen
vegetables
growing
together
in
careless
,
half
-
neglected
abundance
.
<EOS>
In
that
leafy
,
flowery
,
bushy
time
,
to
look
for
any
one
in
this
garden
was
like
playing
at
"
hide
-
and
-
seek
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
the
tall
hollyhocks
beginning
to
flower
and
dazzle
the
eye
with
their
pink
,
white
,
and
yellow
;
there
were
the
syringas
and
Guelder
roses
,
all
large
and
disorderly
for
want
of
trimming
;
there
were
leafy
walls
of
scarlet
beans
and
late
peas
;
there
was
a
row
of
bushy
filberts
in
one
direction
,
and
in
another
a
huge
apple
-
tree
making
a
barren
circle
under
its
low
-
spreading
boughs
.
<EOS>
But
what
signified
a
barren
patch
or
two
?
<EOS>
The
garden
was
so
large
.
<EOS>
There
was
always
a
superfluity
of
broad
beans
 
<EOS>
it
took
nine
or
ten
of
Adam
's
strides
to
get
to
the
end
of
the
uncut
grass
walk
that
ran
by
the
side
of
them
;
and
as
for
other
vegetables
,
there
was
so
much
more
room
than
was
necessary
for
them
that
in
the
rotation
of
crops
a
large
flourishing
bed
of
groundsel
was
of
yearly
occurrence
on
one
spot
or
other
.
<EOS>
The
very
rose
-
trees
at
which
Adam
stopped
to
pluck
one
looked
as
if
they
grew
wild
;
they
were
all
huddled
together
in
bushy
masses
,
now
flaunting
with
wide
-
open
petals
,
almost
all
of
them
of
the
streaked
pink
-
and
-
white
kind
,
which
doubtless
dated
from
the
union
of
the
houses
of
York
and
Lancaster
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
wise
enough
to
choose
a
compact
Provence
<EOS>
rose
that
peeped
out
half
-
smothered
by
its
flaunting
scentless
neighbours
,
and
held
it
in
his
hand
 
<EOS>
he
thought
he
should
be
more
at
ease
holding
something
in
his
hand
 
as
he
walked
on
to
the
far
end
of
the
garden
,
where
he
remembered
there
was
the
largest
row
of
currant
-
trees
,
not
far
off
from
the
great
yew
-
tree
arbour
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
gone
many
steps
beyond
the
roses
,
when
he
heard
the
shaking
of
a
bough
,
and
a
boy
's
voice
saying
,
"
Now
,
then
,
Totty
,
hold
out
your
pinny
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
duck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
voice
came
from
the
boughs
of
a
tall
cherry
-
tree
,
where
Adam
had
no
difficulty
in
discerning
a
small
blue
-
pinafored
figure
perched
in
a
commodious
position
where
the
fruit
was
thickest
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
Totty
was
below
,
behind
the
screen
of
peas
.
<EOS>
Yes
 
with
her
bonnet
hanging
down
her
back
,
and
her
fat
face
,
dreadfully
smeared
with
red
juice
,
turned
up
towards
the
cherry
-
tree
,
while
she
held
her
little
round
hole
of
a
mouth
and
her
red
-
stained
pinafore
to
receive
the
promised
downfall
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
more
than
half
the
cherries
that
fell
were
hard
and
yellow
instead
of
juicy
and
red
;
but
Totty
spent
no
time
in
useless
regrets
,
and
she
was
already
sucking
the
third
juiciest
when
Adam
said
,
"
There
now
,
Totty
,
you
've
got
your
cherries
.
<EOS>
Run
into
the
house
with
'em
to
Mother
 
<EOS>
she
wants
you
 
<EOS>
she
's
in
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
Run
in
this
minute
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
good
little
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
lifted
her
up
in
his
strong
arms
and
kissed
her
as
he
spoke
,
a
ceremony
which
Totty
regarded
as
a
tiresome
interruption
to
cherry
-
eating
;
and
when
he
set
her
down
she
trotted
off
quite
silently
towards
the
house
,
sucking
her
cherries
as
she
went
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tommy
,
my
lad
,
take
care
<EOS>
you
're
not
shot
for
a
little
thieving
bird
,
"
said
Adam
,
as
he
walked
on
towards
the
currant
-
trees
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
see
there
was
a
large
basket
at
the
end
of
the
row
:
<EOS>
Hetty
would
not
be
far
off
,
and
Adam
already
felt
as
if
she
were
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
Yet
when
he
turned
the
corner
she
was
standing
with
her
back
towards
him
,
and
stooping
to
gather
the
low
-
hanging
fruit
.
<EOS>
Strange
that
she
had
not
heard
him
coming
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
making
the
leaves
rustle
.
<EOS>
She
started
when
she
became
conscious
that
some
one
was
near
 
started
so
violently
that
she
dropped
the
basin
with
the
currants
in
it
,
and
then
,
when
she
saw
it
was
Adam
,
she
turned
from
pale
to
deep
red
.
<EOS>
That
blush
made
his
heart
beat
with
a
new
happiness
.
<EOS>
Hetty
had
never
blushed
at
seeing
him
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
frightened
you
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
delicious
sense
that
it
did
n't
signify
what
he
said
,
since
Hetty
seemed
to
feel
as
much
as
he
did
;
"
let
ME
pick
the
currants
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
soon
done
,
for
they
had
only
fallen
in
a
tangled
mass
on
the
grass
-
plot
,
and
Adam
,
as
he
rose
and
gave
her
the
basin
again
,
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
with
the
subdued
tenderness
that
belongs
to
the
first
moments
of
hopeful
love
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
did
not
turn
away
her
eyes
;
her
blush
had
subsided
,
and
she
met
his
glance
with
a
quiet
sadness
,
which
contented
Adam
because
it
was
so
unlike
anything
he
had
seen
in
her
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
not
many
more
currants
to
get
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
shall
soon
ha
'
done
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
help
you
,
"
said
Adam
;
and
he
fetched
the
large
basket
,
which
was
nearly
full
of
currants
,
and
set
it
close
to
them
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
more
was
spoken
as
they
gathered
the
currants
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
was
too
full
to
speak
,
and
he
thought
Hetty
knew
all
that
was
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
indifferent
to
his
presence
after
all
;
she
had
blushed
when
she
saw
him
,
and
then
there
was
that
touch
of
sadness
about
her
which
must
surely
mean
love
,
since
it
was
the
opposite
of
her
usual
manner
,
which
had
often
impressed
him
as
indifference
.
<EOS>
And
he
could
glance
at
her
continually
as
she
bent
over
the
fruit
,
while
the
level
evening
sunbeams
stole
through
the
thick
apple
-
tree
boughs
,
and
rested
on
her
round
cheek
and
neck
as
if
they
too
were
in
love
with
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
Adam
the
time
that
a
man
can
least
forget
in
after
-
life
,
the
time
when
he
believes
that
the
first
woman
he
has
ever
loved
betrays
by
a
slight
something
 
a
word
,
a
tone
,
a
glance
,
the
quivering
of
a
lip
or
an
eyelid
 
that
she
is
at
least
beginning
to
love
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
The
sign
is
so
slight
,
it
is
scarcely
perceptible
to
the
ear
or
eye
 
he
could
describe
it
to
no
one
 
<EOS>
it
is
a
mere
feather
-
touch
,
yet
it
seems
to
have
changed
his
whole
being
,
to
have
merged
an
uneasy
yearning
into
a
delicious
unconsciousness
of
everything
but
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
So
much
of
our
early
gladness
vanishes
utterly
from
our
memory
<EOS>
:
we
can
never
recall
the
joy
with
which
we
laid
our
heads
on
our
mother
's
bosom
or
rode
on
our
father
's
back
in
childhood
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
that
joy
is
wrought
up
into
our
nature
,
as
the
sunlight
of
long
-
past
mornings
is
wrought
up
in
the
soft
mellowness
of
the
apricot
,
but
it
is
gone
for
ever
from
our
imagination
,
and
we
can
only
BELIEVE
in
the
joy
of
childhood
.
<EOS>
But
the
first
glad
moment
in
our
first
love
is
a
vision
which
returns
to
us
to
the
last
,
and
brings
with
it
a
thrill
of
feeling
intense
and
special
as
the
recurrent
sensation
of
a
sweet
odour
breathed
in
a
far
-
off
hour
of
happiness
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
memory
that
gives
a
more
exquisite
touch
to
tenderness
,
that
feeds
the
madness
of
jealousy
and
adds
the
last
keenness
to
the
agony
of
despair
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
bending
over
the
red
bunches
<EOS>
,
the
level
rays
piercing
the
screen
of
apple
-
tree
boughs
,
the
length
of
bushy
garden
beyond
,
his
own
emotion
as
he
looked
at
her
and
believed
that
she
was
thinking
of
him
,
and
that
there
was
no
need
for
them
to
talk
 
Adam
remembered
it
all
to
the
last
moment
of
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
And
Hetty
?
<EOS>
You
know
quite
well
that
Adam
was
mistaken
about
her
.
<EOS>
Like
many
other
men
,
he
thought
the
signs
of
love
for
another
were
signs
of
love
towards
himself
.
<EOS>
When
Adam
was
approaching
unseen
by
her
,
she
was
absorbed
as
usual
in
thinking
and
wondering
about
Arthur
's
possible
return
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
any
man
's
footstep
would
have
affected
her
just
in
the
same
way
 
she
would
have
FELT
it
might
be
Arthur
before
she
had
time
to
see
,
and
the
blood
that
forsook
her
cheek
in
the
agitation
of
that
momentary
feeling
would
have
rushed
back
again
at
the
sight
of
any
one
else
just
as
much
as
at
the
sight
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
wrong
in
thinking
that
a
change
had
come
over
Hetty
:
the
anxieties
and
fears
of
a
first
passion
,
with
which
she
was
trembling
,
had
become
stronger
than
vanity
,
had
given
her
for
the
first
time
that
sense
of
helpless
dependence
on
another
's
feeling
which
awakens
the
clinging
deprecating
womanhood
even
in
the
shallowest
girl
that
can
ever
experience
it
,
and
creates
in
her
a
sensibility
to
kindness
which
found
her
quite
hard
before
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
Hetty
felt
that
there
was
something
soothing
to
her
in
Adam
's
timid
yet
manly
tenderness
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
be
treated
lovingly
 
<EOS>
oh
,
it
was
very
hard
to
bear
this
blank
of
absence
,
silence
,
apparent
indifference
,
after
those
moments
of
glowing
love
!
<EOS>
She
was
not
afraid
that
Adam
would
tease
her
with
love
-
making
and
flattering
speeches
like
her
other
admirers
;
he
had
always
been
so
reserved
to
her
;
she
could
enjoy
without
any
fear
the
sense
that
this
strong
brave
man
loved
her
and
was
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
never
entered
into
her
mind
that
Adam
was
pitiable
too
 
that
Adam
too
must
suffer
one
day
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
,
we
know
,
was
not
the
first
woman
that
had
behaved
more
gently
to
the
man
who
loved
her
in
vain
because
she
had
herself
begun
to
love
another
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
old
story
,
but
Adam
knew
nothing
about
it
,
so
he
drank
in
the
sweet
delusion
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
'll
do
,
"
said
Hetty
,
after
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aunt
wants
me
to
leave
some
on
the
trees
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
'em
in
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
very
well
<EOS>
I
came
to
carry
the
basket
,
"
said
Adam
"
<EOS>
for
it
'
ud
ha
'
been
too
heavy
for
your
little
arms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
could
ha
'
carried
it
with
both
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
daresay
,
"
said
Adam
,
smiling
,
"
and
been
as
long
getting
into
the
house
as
a
little
ant
carrying
a
caterpillar
.
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
seen
those
tiny
fellows
carrying
things
four
times
as
big
as
themselves
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Hetty
,
indifferently
,
not
caring
to
know
the
difficulties
of
ant
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
used
to
watch
'em
often
when
I
was
a
lad
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
you
see
,
I
can
carry
the
basket
with
one
arm
,
as
if
it
was
an
empty
nutshell
,
and
give
you
th
'
other
arm
to
lean
on
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
?
<EOS>
Such
big
arms
as
mine
were
made
for
little
arms
like
yours
to
lean
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
smiled
faintly
and
put
her
arm
within
his
.
<EOS>
Adam
looked
down
at
her
,
but
her
eyes
were
turned
dreamily
towards
another
corner
of
the
garden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
ever
been
to
Eagledale
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
they
walked
slowly
along
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Adam
,
pleased
to
have
her
ask
a
question
about
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Ten
years
ago
,
when
I
was
a
lad
,
I
went
with
father
to
see
about
some
work
there
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
wonderful
sight
 
<EOS>
rocks
and
caves
such
as
you
never
saw
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
I
never
had
a
right
notion
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
rocks
till
I
went
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
long
did
it
take
to
get
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
it
took
us
the
best
part
o
'
two
days
'
walking
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
nothing
of
a
day
's
journey
for
anybody
as
has
got
a
first
-
rate
nag
.
<EOS>
The
captain
'
ud
get
there
in
nine
or
ten
hours
,
I
'll
be
bound
<EOS>
,
he
's
such
a
rider
.
<EOS>
And
I
should
n't
wonder
if
he
's
back
again
to
-
morrow
;
he
's
too
active
to
rest
long
in
that
lonely
place
,
all
by
himself
,
for
there
's
nothing
but
a
bit
of
a
inn
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
that
part
where
he
's
gone
to
fish
.
<EOS>
I
wish
he
'd
got
th
'
estate
in
his
hands
;
that
'
ud
be
the
right
thing
for
him
,
for
it
'
ud
give
him
plenty
to
do
,
and
he
'd
do't
well
too
,
for
all
he
's
so
young
<EOS>
;
he
's
got
better
notions
<EOS>
o
'
things
than
many
a
man
twice
his
age
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
very
handsome
to
me
th
'
other
day
about
lending
me
money
to
set
up
i
'
business
;
and
if
things
came
round
that
way
,
I
'd
rather
be
beholding
to
him
nor
to
any
man
<EOS>
i
'
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Adam
was
led
on
to
speak
about
Arthur
because
he
thought
Hetty
would
be
pleased
to
know
that
the
young
squire
was
so
ready
to
befriend
him
;
the
fact
entered
into
his
future
prospects
,
which
he
would
like
to
seem
promising
in
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
true
that
Hetty
listened
with
an
interest
which
brought
a
new
light
into
her
eyes
and
a
half
-
smile
upon
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
pretty
the
roses
are
now
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
continued
,
pausing
to
look
at
them
.
"
<EOS>
See
!
<EOS>
I
stole
the
prettiest
,
but
<EOS>
I
didna
mean
to
keep
it
myself
.
<EOS>
I
think
these
as
are
all
pink
,
and
have
got
a
finer
sort
o
'
green
leaves
,
are
prettier
than
the
striped
uns
,
do
n't
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
set
down
the
basket
and
took
the
rose
from
his
button
-
hole
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
smells
very
sweet
,
"
he
said
;
"
those
striped
uns
have
no
smell
.
<EOS>
Stick
it
in
your
frock
,
and
then
you
can
put
it
in
water
after
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
a
pity
to
let
it
fade
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
took
the
rose
,
smiling
as
she
did
so
at
the
pleasant
thought
that
Arthur
could
so
soon
get
back
if
he
liked
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
flash
of
hope
and
happiness
in
her
mind
,
and
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
gaiety
<EOS>
she
did
what
she
had
very
often
done
before
 
stuck
the
rose
in
her
hair
a
little
above
the
left
ear
.
<EOS>
The
tender
admiration
in
Adam
's
face
was
slightly
shadowed
by
reluctant
disapproval
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
love
of
finery
was
just
the
thing
that
would
most
provoke
his
mother
,
and
he
himself
disliked
it
as
much
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
dislike
anything
that
belonged
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
's
like
the
ladies
in
the
pictures
at
the
Chase
;
they
've
mostly
got
flowers
or
feathers
or
gold
things
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
their
hair
,
but
somehow
I
do
n't
like
to
see
'em
<EOS>
;
they
allays
put
me
<EOS>
i
'
mind
<EOS>
o
'
the
painted
women
outside
the
shows
at
Treddles'on
Fair
.
<EOS>
What
can
a
woman
have
to
set
her
off
better
than
her
own
hair
,
when
it
curls
so
,
like
yours
?
<EOS>
If
a
woman
's
young
and
pretty
,
I
think
you
can
see
her
good
<EOS>
looks
all
the
better
for
her
being
plain
dressed
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Dinah
Morris
looks
very
nice
,
for
all
she
wears
such
a
plain
cap
and
gown
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
as
a
woman
's
face
doesna
want
flowers
;
it
's
almost
like
a
flower
itself
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
yours
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
very
well
,
"
said
Hetty
,
with
a
little
playful
pout
,
taking
the
rose
out
of
her
hair
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
put
one
o
'
<EOS>
Dinah
's
caps
on
when
we
go
in
,
and
you
'll
see
if
I
look
better
in
it
.
<EOS>
She
left
one
behind
,
so
I
can
take
the
pattern
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
I
do
n't
want
you
to
wear
a
Methodist
cap
like
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
it
's
a
very
ugly
cap
,
and
I
used
to
think
when
I
saw
her
here
as
it
was
nonsense
for
her
to
dress
different
t
'
other
people
;
but
I
never
rightly
noticed
her
till
she
came
to
see
mother
last
week
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
thought
the
cap
seemed
to
fit
her
face
somehow
as
th
<EOS>
'
acorn
-
cup
fits
th
'
acorn
,
and
I
should
n't
like
to
see
her
so
well
without
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
've
got
another
sort
<EOS>
o
'
face
;
I
'd
have
you
just
as
you
are
now
,
without
anything
t
'
interfere
with
your
own
looks
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
when
a
man
's
singing
a
good
tune
 
<EOS>
you
do
n't
want
t
'
hear
bells
tinkling
and
interfering
wi
'
the
sound
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
arm
and
put
it
within
his
again
,
looking
down
on
her
fondly
.
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
she
should
think
he
had
lectured
her
,
imagining
,
as
we
are
apt
to
do
,
that
she
had
perceived
all
the
thoughts
he
had
only
half
-
expressed
.
<EOS>
And
the
thing
he
dreaded
most
was
lest
any
cloud
should
come
over
this
evening
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
For
the
world
he
would
not
have
spoken
of
his
love
to
Hetty
yet
,
till
this
commencing
kindness
towards
him
should
have
grown
into
unmistakable
love
.
<EOS>
In
his
imagination
he
saw
long
years
of
his
future
life
stretching
before
him
,
blest
with
the
right
to
call
Hetty
his
own
:
he
could
be
content
with
very
little
at
present
.
<EOS>
So
he
took
up
the
basket
of
currants
once
more
,
and
they
went
on
towards
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
had
quite
changed
in
the
half
-
hour
that
Adam
had
been
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
The
yard
was
full
of
life
now
:
Marty
was
letting
the
screaming
geese
through
the
gate
,
and
wickedly
provoking
the
gander
by
hissing
at
him
;
the
granary
-
door
was
groaning
on
its
hinges
as
Alick
shut
it
,
after
dealing
out
the
corn
;
the
horses
were
being
led
out
to
watering
,
amidst
much
barking
of
all
the
three
dogs
and
many
"
whups
"
from
Tim
<EOS>
the
ploughman
,
as
if
the
heavy
animals
who
held
down
their
meek
,
intelligent
heads
,
and
lifted
their
shaggy
feet
so
deliberately
,
were
likely
to
rush
wildly
in
every
direction
but
the
right
.
<EOS>
Everybody
was
come
back
from
the
meadow
;
and
when
Hetty
and
Adam
entered
the
house
-
place
,
Mr.
Poyser
was
seated
in
the
three
-
cornered
chair
,
and
the
grandfather
in
the
large
arm
-
chair
opposite
,
looking
on
with
pleasant
expectation
while
the
supper
was
being
laid
on
the
oak
table
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
had
laid
the
cloth
herself
 
a
cloth
made
of
homespun
linen
,
with
a
shining
checkered
pattern
on
it
,
and
of
an
agreeable
whitey
-
brown
hue
,
such
as
all
sensible
housewives
like
to
see
 
none
of
your
bleached
"
shop
-
rag
"
that
would
wear
into
holes
in
no
time
,
but
good
homespun
that
would
last
for
two
generations
.
<EOS>
The
cold
veal
,
the
fresh
lettuces
,
and
the
stuffed
chine
might
well
look
tempting
to
hungry
men
who
had
dined
at
half
-
past
twelve
o'clock
.
<EOS>
On
the
large
deal
table
against
the
wall
there
were
bright
pewter
plates
and
spoons
and
cans
,
ready
for
Alick
and
his
companions
;
for
the
master
and
servants
ate
their
supper
not
far
off
each
other
;
which
was
all
the
pleasanter
,
because
if
a
remark
about
to
-
morrow
morning
's
work
occurred
to
Mr.
Poyser
,
Alick
was
at
hand
to

"
Well

Adam

I
'm
glad

said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What

<EOS>
ye've
been
helping
Hetty
to
gether
the

Come

sit

<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
pretty
near
a
three
-
week
since
y

had
your
supper
with
us
;
and
the
missis
has
got
one
of
her
rare
stuffed
chines
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
ye're
come

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hetty
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
she
looked
into
the
basket
of
currants
to
see
if
the
fruit
was
fine
,
"
run
upstairs
and
send
Molly
down
.
<EOS>
She
's
putting
Totty
to
bed
,
and
I
want
her
to
draw
th
'
ale
,
for
Nancy
's
busy
<EOS>
yet
<EOS>
i
'
the
dairy
.
<EOS>
You
can
see
to
the
child
.
<EOS>
But
whativer
did
you
let
her
run
away
from
you
along
wi
'
Tommy
for
,
and
stuff
herself
wi
'
fruit
as
she
ca
n't
eat
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
good
victual
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
said
in
a
lower
tone
than
usual
,
while
her
husband
was
talking
to
Adam
;
for
Mrs.
Poyser
was
strict
in
adherence
to
her
own
rules
of
propriety
,
and
she
considered
that
a
young
girl
was
not
to
be
treated
sharply
in
the
presence
of
a
respectable
man
who
was
courting
her
.
<EOS>
That
would
not
be
fair
-
play
:
every
woman
was
young
in
her
turn
,
and
had
her
chances
of
matrimony
,
which
it
was
a
point
of
honour
for
other
women
not
to
spoil
 
just
as
one
market
-
woman
who
has
sold
her
own
eggs
must
not
try
to
balk
another
of
a
customer
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
made
haste
to
run
away
upstairs
,
not
easily
finding
an
answer
to
her
aunt
's
question
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
went
out
to
see
after
Marty
and
Tommy
and
bring
them
in
to
supper
.
  
<EOS>
Soon
they
were
all
seated
 
the
two
rosy
lads
,
one
on
each
side
,
by
the
pale
mother
,
a
place
being
left
for
Hetty
between
Adam
and
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
Alick
too
was
come
in
,
and
was
seated
in
his
far
corner
,
eating
cold
broad
beans
out
of
a
large
dish
with
his
pocket
-
knife
,
and
finding
a
flavour
in
them
which
he
would
not
have
exchanged
for
the
finest
pineapple
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
time
that
gell
is
drawing
th
'
ale
,
to
be
sure
!
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
when
she
was
dispensing
her
slices
of
stuffed
chine
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
she
sets
the
jug
under
and
forgets
to
turn
the
tap
,
as
there
's
nothing
you
ca
n't
believe
o

<EOS>
them
wenches
:
they
'll
set
the
empty
kettle

the
fire
,
and
then
come
an
hour
after
to

water
boils

<EOS>
"
She
's
drawin

for
the
men

said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Thee

ha

told
her
to
bring
our
jug
up
first

"
  
<EOS>

Told

said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Yes

I
might
spend
all

Mr.

some
vinegar
with
your
lettuce
?
<EOS>
Aye
you
're
i

<EOS>
the
right
not
.
<EOS>
It
spoils
the
flavour
o
'
the
chine
,
to
my
thinking
.
<EOS>
It
's
poor
eating
<EOS>
where
the
flavour
o
'
<EOS>
the
meat
lies
i

the
cruets

<EOS>
There

<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
's
attention
was
here
diverted
by
the
appearance
of
Molly
,
carrying
a
large
jug
,
two
small
mugs
,
and
four
drinking
-
cans
,
all
full
of
ale
or
small
beer
 
an
interesting
example
of
the
prehensile
power
possessed
by
the
human
hand
.
<EOS>
Poor
Molly
's
mouth
was
rather
wider
open
than
usual
,
as
she
walked
along
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
double
cluster
of
vessels
in
her
hands
,
quite
innocent
of
the
expression
in
her
mistress
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
"
Molly
,
I
niver
knew
your
equils
 
to
think
o
'
your
poor
mother
as
is
a
widow

an

I
took
you
wi

<EOS>
as
good

"
  
<EOS>
Molly
had
not
seen
the
lightning
,
and
the
thunder
shook
her
nerves
the
more
for
the
want
of
that
preparation
.
<EOS>
With
a
vague
alarmed
sense
that
she
must
somehow
comport
herself
differently
,
she
hastened
her
step
a
little
towards
the
far
deal
table
,
where
she
might
set
down
her
cans
 
caught
her
foot
in
her
apron
,
which
had
become
untied
,
and
fell
with
a
crash
and
a
splash
into
a
pool
of
beer
;
whereupon
a
tittering
explosion
from
Marty
and
Tommy
,
and
a
serious
"
Ello
!
"
<EOS>
from
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
saw
his
draught
of
ale
unpleasantly
deferred
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
you
go
!
"
resumed
Mrs.
Poyser
,
in
a
cutting
tone
,
as
she
rose
and
went
towards
the
cupboard
while
Molly
began
dolefully
to
pick
up
the
fragments
of
pottery
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
what
I
told
you

ud
come

over

over
again

there
's

It

a

up

<EOS>
Poor
Molly
's
tears
were
dropping
fast
by
this
time
,
and
in
her
desperation
at
the
lively
movement
of
the
beer
-
stream
towards
Alick
's
legs
,
she
was
converting
her
apron
into
a
mop
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
,
opening
the
cupboard
,
turned
a
blighting
eye
upon
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah

"
she
went
on
,
"
you
'll
do
no

up

<EOS>
It
's
all
your
own
wilfulness
,
as
I
tell
you
,
for
there
's
nobody
no
call
to
break
anything
if
they
'll
only
go
the
right

But
wooden
folks
had
need

<EOS>
And
here
must
I
take
the
brown

and

white
jug
,
as
it
's
niver
been
used
three
times
this

go

<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
had
turned
round
from
the
cupboard
with
the
brown
-
and
-
white
jug
in
her
hand
,
when
she
caught
sight
of
something
at
the
other
end
of
the
kitchen
;
perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
already
trembling
and
nervous
that
the
apparition
had
so
strong
an
effect
on
her
;
perhaps
jug
-
breaking
,
like
other
crimes
,
has
a
contagious
influence
.
<EOS>
However
it
was
,
she
stared
and
started
like
a
ghost
-
seer
,
and
the
precious
brown
-
and
-
white
jug
fell
to
the
ground
,
parting
for
ever
with
its
spout
and
handle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
ever
anybody
see
the
like
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
a
suddenly
lowered
tone
,
after
a
moment
's
bewildered
glance
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
jugs
are
bewitched
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
It
's
them
nasty
glazed
handles
 
<EOS>
they
slip
o'er
the
finger
like
a
snail

"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thee'st
let
thy
own
whip
fly
<EOS>
i
'
thy
face

"
said
her
husband
,
who
had
now
joined
in
the
laugh
of
the
young
ones
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
all
very
fine
to
look
on
and
grin
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Poyser
;
"
but
there
's
times
when
the
crockery
seems
alive

'
flies
out

It

What

"
  
<EOS>
A
new
outbreak
of
laughter
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
was
speaking
,
was
caused
,
less
by
her
sudden
conversion
to
a
fatalistic
view
of
jug
-
breaking
than
by
that
strange
appearance
of
Hetty
,
which
had
startled
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
The
little
minx
had
found
a
black
gown
of
her
aunt
's
,
and
pinned
it
close
round
her
neck
to
look
like
Dinah
's
,
had
made
her
hair
as
flat
as
she
could
,
and
had
tied
on
one
of
Dinah
's
high
-
crowned
borderless
net
caps
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
Dinah
's
pale
grave
face
and
mild
grey
eyes
,
which
the
sight
of
the
gown
and
cap
brought
with
it
,
made
it
a
laughable
surprise
enough
to
see
them
replaced
by
Hetty
's
round
rosy
cheeks
and
coquettish
dark
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
boys
got
off
their
chairs
and
jumped
round
her
,
clapping
their
hands
,
and
even
Alick
gave
a
low
ventral
laugh
as
he
looked
up
from
his
beans
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
the
noise
,
Mrs.
Poyser
went
into
the
back
kitchen
to
send
Nancy
into
the
cellar
with
the
great
pewter
measure
,
which
had
some
chance
of
being
free
from
bewitchment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Hetty
,
lass
,
are
ye
turned
Methodist
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
that
comfortable
slow
enjoyment
of
a
laugh
which
one
only
sees
in
stout
people
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
pull
your
face
a
deal
longer
before
you
'll
do

How

<EOS>
"
Adam
said
he
liked
Dinah

cap
and
gown
better

my

said
Hetty
,
sitting
down
demurely
.
"
<EOS>
He
says
folks
looks
better
in
ugly
clothes

<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay

said
Adam
,
looking
at
her
admiringly
;
"
I
only
said

But

Mr.

now
came
back

took
her
seat
again

Mrs.

natured
father
,
indulgent
to
all
weaknesses
but
those
of
negligent
farmers
,
said
to
Hetty
,
"
You
'd
better
take
the
things
off
again
,
my
lass
;
it
hurts
your
aunt
to
see
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
went
upstairs
again
,
and
the
arrival
of
the
ale
made
an
agreeable
diversion
;
for
Adam
had
to
give
his
opinion
of
the
new
tap
,
which
could
not
be
otherwise
than
complimentary
to
Mrs.
Poyser
;
and
then
followed
a
discussion
on
the
secrets
of
good
brewing
,
the
folly
of
stinginess
in
"
hopping
,
"
and
the
doubtful
economy
of
a
farmer
's
making
his
own
malt
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
had
so
many
opportunities
of
expressing
herself
with
weight
on
these
subjects
that
by
the
time
supper
was
ended
,
the
ale
-
jug
refilled
,
and
Mr.
Poyser
's
pipe
alight
<EOS>
she
was
once
more
in
high
good
humour
,
and
ready
,
at
Adam
's
request
,
to
fetch
the
broken
spinning
-
wheel
for
his
inspection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Adam
,
looking
at
it
carefully
,
"
here
's
<EOS>
a
nice
bit
o
'
turning
wanted
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pretty
wheel
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
it
up
at
the
turning
-
shop
in
the
village
and
do
it
there
,
for
I
've
no
convenence
for
turning
at
home
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
send
it
to
Mr.
Burge
's
shop
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
the
morning
,
I
'll
get
it
done
for
you
by
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
turning
it
over
in
my
mind
,
"
he
continued
,
looking
at
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
to
make
a
bit
more
convenence
at
home
for
nice
jobs
o
'
cabinet
-
making
.
<EOS>
I
've
always
done
a
deal
at
such
little
things
in
odd
hours
,
and
they
're
profitable
,
for
there
's
more
workmanship
nor
material
in
'em
.
<EOS>
I
look
for
me
and
Seth
to
get
a
little
business
for
ourselves
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
that
way
,
for
I
know
a
man
at
Rosseter
as
'
ull
take
as
many
things
as
we
should
make
,
besides
what
we
could
get
orders
for
round
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
entered
with
interest
into
a
project
which
seemed
a
step
towards
<EOS>
Adam
's
becoming
a
"
master
-
man
,
"
and
Mrs.
Poyser
gave
her
approbation
to
the
scheme
of
the
movable
kitchen
cupboard
,
which
was
to
be
capable
of
containing
grocery
,
pickles
,
crockery
,
and
house
-
linen
in
the
utmost
compactness
without
confusion
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
once
more
in
her
own
dress
,
with
her
neckerchief
pushed
a
little
backwards
on
this
warm
evening
,
was
seated
picking
currants
near
the
window
,
where
Adam
could
see
her
quite
well
.
<EOS>
And
so
the
time
passed
pleasantly
till
Adam
got
up
to
go
.
<EOS>
He
was
pressed
to
come
again
soon
,
but
not
to
stay
longer
,
for
at
this
busy
time
sensible
people
would
not
run
the
risk
of
being
sleepy
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
take
a
step
farther
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
and
go
on
to
see
Mester
Massey
,
for
he
was
n't
at
church
yesterday
,
and
I
've
not
seen
him
for
a
week
past
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
hardly
known
him
to
miss
church
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
we
've
heared
nothing
about
him
,
for
it

the

so
we

you
no

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
'll
niver
think
o
'
going
there
at
this
hour

"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
folding
up
her
knitting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Mester
Massey
sits
up
late
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An

Some

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I

said
Mrs.

,
"

Adam

laughing
,
"

<EOS>
Hetty
could
only
smile
and
not
shake
hands
,
for
hers
were
dyed
and
damp
with
currant
-
juice
;
but
all
the
rest
gave
a
hearty
shake
to
the
large
palm
that
was
held
out
to
them
,
and
said
,
"
Come
again
,
come
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
think
o
'
that
now
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
when
Adam
was
out
of
on
the
causeway
.
<EOS>
"
Sitting
up
till
past
twelve

<EOS>
Ye'll

six

<EOS>
If
you
can
catch
Adam
for
a
husband
,
Hetty
,
you
'll
ride
i
'
your
own
spring
-
cart
some
day
,
I
'll
be
your
warrant

"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
moving
across
the
kitchen
with
the
currants
,
so
her
uncle
did
not
see
the
little
toss
of
the
head
with
which
she
answered
him
.
<EOS>
To
ride
in
a
spring
-
cart
seemed
a
very
miserable
lot
indeed
to
her
now
.
    
<EOS>
The
Night
-
School
and
the
Schoolmaster
  
Bartle
Massey
's
was
one
of
a
few
scattered
houses
on
the
edge
of
a
common
,
which
was
divided
by
the
road
to
Treddleston
.
<EOS>
Adam
reached
it
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
leaving
the
Hall
Farm
;
and
when
he
had
his
hand
on
the
door
-
latch
,
he
could
see
,
through
the
curtainless
window
,
that
there
were
eight
or
nine
heads
bending
over
the
desks
,
lighted
by
thin
dips
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
entered
,
a
reading
lesson
was
going
forward
and
Bartle
Massey
merely
nodded
,
leaving
him
to
take
his
place
where
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
come
for
the
sake
of
a
lesson
to
-
night
,
and
his
mind
was
too
full
of
personal
matters
,
too
full
of
the
last
two
hours
he
had
passed
in
Hetty
's
presence
,
for
him
to
amuse
himself
with
a
book
till
school
<EOS>
was
over
;
so
he
sat
down
in
a
corner
and
looked
on
with
an
absent
mind
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
sort
of
scene
which
Adam
had
beheld
almost
weekly
for
years
;
he
knew
by
heart
every
arabesque
flourish
in
the
framed
specimen
of
Bartle
Massey
's
handwriting
which
hung
over
the
schoolmaster
's
head
,
by
way
of
keeping
a
lofty
ideal
before
the
minds
of
his
pupils
;
he
knew
the
backs
of
all
the
books
on
the
shelf
running
along
the
whitewashed
wall
above
the
pegs
for
the
slates
;
he
knew
exactly
how
many
grains
were
gone
out
of
the
ear
of
Indian
corn
that
hung
from
one
of
the
rafters
;
he
had
long
ago
exhausted
the
resources
of
his
imagination
in
trying
to
think
how
the
bunch
of
leathery
seaweed
had
looked
and
grown
in
its
native
element
;
and
from
the
place
where
he
sat
,
he
could
make
nothing
of
the
old
map
of
England
that
hung
against
the
opposite
wall
,
for
age
had
turned
it
of
a
fine
yellow
brown
,
something
like
that
of
a
well
-
seasoned
meerschaum
.
<EOS>
The
drama
that
was
going
on
was
almost
as
familiar
as
the
scene
,
nevertheless
habit
had
not
made
him
indifferent
to
it
,
and
even
in
his
present
self
-
absorbed
mood
,
Adam
felt
a
momentary
stirring
of
the
old
fellow
-
feeling
,
as
he
looked
at
the
rough
men
painfully
holding
pen
or
pencil
with
their
cramped
hands
,
or
humbly
labouring
through
their
reading
lesson
.
  
<EOS>
The
reading
class
now
seated
on
the
form
in
front
of
the
schoolmaster
's
desk
consisted
of
the
three
most
backward
pupils
.
<EOS>
Adam
would
have
known
it
only
by
seeing
Bartle
Massey
's
face
as
he
looked
over
his
spectacles
,
which
he
had
shifted
to
the
ridge
of
his
nose
,
not
requiring
them
for
present
purposes
.
<EOS>
The
face
wore
its
mildest
expression
:
the
grizzled
bushy
eyebrows
had
taken
their
more
acute
angle
of
compassionate
kindness
,
and
the
mouth
,
habitually
compressed
with
a
pout
of
the
lower
lip
,
was
relaxed
so
as
to
be
ready
to
speak
a
helpful
word
or
syllable
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
This
gentle
expression
was
the
more
interesting
because
the
schoolmaster
's
nose
,
an
irregular
aquiline
twisted
a
little
on
one
side
,
had
rather
a
formidable
character
;
and
his
brow
,
moreover
,
had
that
peculiar
tension
which
always
impresses
one
as
a
sign
of
a
keen
impatient
temperament
:
the
blue
veins
stood
out
like
cords
under
the
transparent
yellow
skin
,
and
this
intimidating
brow
was
softened
by
no
tendency
to
baldness
,
for
the
grey
bristly
hair
,
cut
down
to
about
an
inch
in
length
,
stood
round
it
in
as
close
ranks
as
ever
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Bill
,
nay
,
<EOS>
"
Bartle
was
saying
in
a
kind
tone
,
as
he
nodded
to
Adam
,
"
begin
that
again
,
and
then
perhaps
,
it
'll
come
to
you
what
d
-
<EOS>
r
-
y
spells
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
same
lesson
you
read
last
week
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bill
"
was
a
sturdy
fellow
,
aged
four
-
and
-
twenty
,
an
excellent
stone
-
sawyer
,
who
could
get
as
good
wages
as
any
man
in
the
trade
of
his
years
;
but
he
found
a
reading
lesson
in
words
of
one
syllable
a
harder
matter
to
deal
with
than
the
hardest
stone
he
had
ever
had
to
saw
.
<EOS>
The
letters
,
he
complained
,
were
so
"
uncommon
alike
,
there
was
no
tellin
'
<EOS>
'em
one
from
another
,
"
the
sawyer
's
business
not
being
concerned
with
minute
differences
such
as
exist
between
a
letter
with
its
tail
turned
up
and
a
letter
with
its
tail
turned
down
.
<EOS>
But
Bill
had
a
firm
determination
that
he
would
learn
to
read
,
founded
chiefly
on
two
reasons
:
<EOS>
first
,
that
Tom
Hazelow
,
his
cousin
,
could
read
anything
"
right
off
,
"
whether
it
was
print
or
writing
,
and
Tom
had
sent
him
a
letter
from
twenty
miles
off
,
saying
how
he
was
prospering
in
the
world
and
had
got
an
overlooker
's
place
;
secondly
,
that
Sam
Phillips
,
who
sawed
with
him
,
had
learned
to
read
when
he
was
turned
twenty
,
and
what
could
be
done
by
a
little
fellow
like
Sam
Phillips
,
Bill
considered
,
could
be
done
by
himself
,
seeing
that
he
could
pound
Sam
into
wet
clay
if
circumstances
required
it
.
<EOS>
So
here
he
was
,
pointing
his
big
finger
towards
three
words
at
once
,
and
turning
his
head
on
one
side
that
he
might
keep
better
hold
with
his
eye
of
the
one
word
which
was
to
be
discriminated
out
of
the
group
.
<EOS>
The
amount
of
knowledge
Bartle
Massey
must
possess
was
something
so
dim
and
vast
that
Bill
's
imagination
recoiled
before
it
:
he
would
hardly
have
ventured
to
deny
that
the
schoolmaster
might
have
something
to
do
in
bringing
about
the
regular
return
of
daylight
and
the
changes
in
the
weather
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
seated
next
to
Bill
was
of
a
very
different
type
:
he
was
a
Methodist
brickmaker
who
,
after
spending
thirty
years
of
his
life
in
perfect
satisfaction
with
his
ignorance
,
had
lately
"
got
religion
,
"
and
along
with
it
the
desire
to
read
the
Bible
.
<EOS>
But
with
him
,
too
,
learning
was
a
heavy
business
,
and
on
his
way
out
to
-
night
he
had
offered
as
usual
a
special
prayer
for
help
,
seeing
that
he
had
undertaken
this
hard
task
with
a
single
eye
to
the
nourishment
of
his
soul
 
that
he
might
have
a
greater
abundance
of
texts
and
hymns
wherewith
to
banish
evil
memories
and
the
temptations
of
old
habit
 
or
,
in
brief
language
,
the
devil
.
<EOS>
For
the
brickmaker
had
been
a
notorious
poacher
,
and
was
suspected
,
though
there
was
no
good
evidence
against
him
,
of
being
the
man
who
had
shot
a
neighbouring
gamekeeper
in
the
leg
.
<EOS>
However
that
might
be
,
it
is
certain
that
shortly
after
the
accident
referred
to
,
which
was
coincident
with
the
arrival
of
an
awakening
Methodist
preacher
at
Treddleston
,
a
great
change
had
been
observed
in
the
brickmaker
;
and
though
he
was
still
known
in
the
neighbourhood
by
his
old
sobriquet
of
"
Brimstone
,
"
there
was
nothing
he
held
in
so
much
horror
as
any
further
transactions
with
that
evil
-
smelling
element
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
broad
-
chested
fellow
with
a
fervid
temperament
,
which
helped
him
better
in
imbibing
religious
ideas
than
in
the
dry
process
of
acquiring
the
mere
human
knowledge
of
the
alphabet
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
been
already
a
little
shaken
in
his
resolution
by
a
brother
Methodist
,
who
assured
him
that
the
letter
was
a
mere
obstruction
to
the
Spirit
,
and
expressed
a
fear
that
Brimstone
was
too
eager
for
the
knowledge
that
puffeth
up
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
beginner
was
a
much
more
promising
pupil
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
but
thin
and
wiry
man
,
nearly
as
old
as
Brimstone
,
with
a
very
pale
face
and
hands
stained
a
deep
blue
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
dyer
,
who
in
the
course
of
dipping
homespun
wool
and
old
women
's
petticoats
had
got
fired
with
the
ambition
to
learn
a
great
deal
more
about
the
strange
secrets
of
colour
.
<EOS>
He
had
already
a
high
reputation
in
the
district
for
his
dyes
,
and
he
was
bent
on
discovering
some
method
by
which
he
could
reduce
the
expense
of
crimsons
and
scarlets
.
<EOS>
The
druggist
at
Treddleston
had
given
him
a
notion
that
he
might
save
himself
a
great
deal
of
labour
and
expense
if
he
could
learn
to
read
,
and
so
he
had
begun
to
give
his
spare
hours
to
the
night
-
school
,
resolving
that
his
"
little
chap
"
should
lose
no
time
in
coming
to
Mr.
Massey
's
day
-
school
as
soon
as
he
was
old
enough
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
touching
to
see
these
three
big
men
,
with
the
marks
of
their
hard
labour
about
them
,
anxiously
bending
over
the
worn
books
and
painfully
making
out
,
"
The
grass
is
green
,
"
"
The
sticks
are
dry
,
"
"
The
corn
is
ripe
"
 
a
very
hard
lesson
to
pass
to
after
columns
of
single
words
all
alike
except
in
the
first
letter
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
as
if
three
rough
animals
were
making
humble
efforts
to
learn
how
they
might
become
human
.
<EOS>
And
it
touched
the
tenderest
fibre
in
Bartle
Massey
's
nature
,
for
such
full
-
grown
children
as
these
were
the
only
pupils
for
whom
he
had
no
severe
epithets
and
no
impatient
tones
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
gifted
with
an
imperturbable
temper
,
and
on
music
-
nights
it
was
apparent
that
patience
could
never
be
an
easy
virtue
to
him
;
but
<EOS>
this
evening
,
as
he
glances
over
his
spectacles
at
Bill
Downes
,
the
sawyer
,
who
is
turning
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
desperate
sense
of
blankness
before
the
letters
d
-
r
-
y
,
his
eyes
shed
their
mildest
and
most
encouraging
light
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
reading
class
,
two
youths
between
sixteen
and
nineteen
came
up
with
the
imaginary
bills
of
parcels
,
which
they
had
been
writing
out
on
their
slates
and
were
now
required
to
calculate
"
off
-
hand
"
 
a
test
which
they
stood
with
such
imperfect
success
that
Bartle
Massey
,
whose
eyes
had
been
glaring
at
them
ominously
through
his
spectacles
for
some
minutes
,
at
length
burst
out
in
a
bitter
,
high
-
pitched
tone
,
pausing
between
every
sentence
to
rap
the
floor
with
a
knobbed
stick
which
rested
between
his
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
you
see
,
you
do
n't
do
this
thing
a
bit
better
than
you
did
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
what
's
the
reason
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
learn
accounts
 
<EOS>
that
's
well
and
good
.
<EOS>
But
you
think
all
you
need
do
to
learn
accounts
is
to
come
to
me
and
do
sums
for
an
hour
or
so
,
two
or
three
times
a
-
week
;
and
no
sooner
do
you
get
your
caps
on
and
turn
out
of
doors
again
than
you
sweep
the
whole
thing
clean
out
of
your
mind
.
<EOS>
You
go
whistling
about
,
and
take
no
more
care
what
you
're
thinking
of
than
if
your
heads
were
gutters
for
any
rubbish
to
swill
through
that
happened
to
be
in
the
way
;
and
if
you
get
a
good
notion
in
'em
,
it
's
pretty
soon
washed
out
again
.
<EOS>
You
think
knowledge
is
to
be
got
cheap
 
<EOS>
you
'll
come
and
pay
Bartle
Massey
sixpence
a
-
week
,
and
he
'll
make
you
clever
at
figures
without
your
taking
any
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
knowledge
is
n't
to
be
got
with
paying
sixpence
,
let
me
tell
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
're
to
know
figures
,
you
must
turn
'em
over
in
your
heads
and
keep
your
thoughts
fixed
on
'em
.
<EOS>
There
's
nothing
you
ca
n't
turn
into
a
sum
,
for
there
's
nothing
but
<EOS>
what
's
got
number
in
it
 
even
a
fool
.
<EOS>
You
may
say
to
yourselves
,
"
I
'm
one
fool
,
and
Jack
's
another
;
if
my
fool
's
head
weighed
four
pound
,
and
Jack
's
three
pound
three
ounces
and
three
quarters
,
<EOS>
how
many
pennyweights
heavier
would
my
head
be
than
Jack
's
?
"
<EOS>
A
man
that
had
got
his
heart
in
learning
figures
would
make
sums
for
himself
and
work
'em
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
When
he
sat
at
his
shoemaking
,
he
'd
count
his
stitches
by
fives
,
and
then
put
a
price
on
his
stitches
,
say
half
a
farthing
,
and
then
see
how
much
money
he
could
get
in
an
hour
;
and
then
ask
himself
how
much
money
he
'd
get
in
a
day
at
that
rate
;
<EOS>
and
then
how
much
ten
workmen
would
get
working
three
,
or
twenty
,
or
<EOS>
a
hundred
years
at
that
rate
 
and
all
the
while
his
needle
would
be
going
just
as
fast
as
if
he
left
his
head
empty
for
the
devil
to
dance
in
.
<EOS>
But
the
long
and
the
short
of
it
is
 
I
'll
have
nobody
in
my
night
-
school
that
does
n't
strive
to
learn
what
he
comes
to
learn
,
as
hard
as
if
he
was
striving
to
get
out
of
a
dark
hole
into
broad
daylight
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
no
man
away
because
he
's
stupid
:
if
Billy
Taft
,
the
idiot
,
wanted
to
learn
anything
,
I
'd
not
refuse
to
teach
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
not
throw
away
good
knowledge
on
people
who
think
they
can
get
it
by
the
sixpenn'orth
,
and
carry
it
away
with
'em
as
they
would
an
ounce
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
So
never
come
to
me
again
,
if
you
ca
n't
show
that
you
've
been
working
with
your
own
heads
,
instead
of
thinking
that
you
can
pay
for
mine
to
work
for
you
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
last
word
I
've
got
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
this
final
sentence
,
Bartle
Massey
gave
a
sharper
rap
than
ever
with
his
knobbed
stick
,
and
the
discomfited
lads
got
up
to
go
with
a
sulky
look
.
<EOS>
The
other
pupils
had
happily
only
their
writing
-
books
to
show
,
in
various
stages
of
progress
from
pot
-
hooks
to
round
text
;
and
mere
pen
-
strokes
,
however
perverse
,
were
less
exasperating
to
Bartle
than
false
arithmetic
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
little
more
severe
than
usual
on
Jacob
Storey
's
Z
's
,
of
which
poor
Jacob
had
written
a
pageful
,
all
with
their
tops
<EOS>
turned
the
wrong
way
,
with
a
puzzled
sense
that
they
were
not
right
"
somehow
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
observed
in
apology
,
that
it
was
a
letter
you
never
wanted
hardly
,
and
he
thought
it
had
only
been
there
"
to
finish
off
th
'
alphabet
,
like
,
though
ampusand
(
&
)
would
ha
'
done
as
well
,
<EOS>
for
what
he
could
see
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
pupils
had
all
taken
their
hats
and
said
their
"
Good
-
nights
,
"
and
Adam
,
knowing
his
old
master
's
habits
,
rose
and
said
,
"
Shall
I
put
the
candles
out
,
Mr.
Massey
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
boy
,
yes
,
all
but
this
,
which
I
'll
carry
into
the
house
;
and
just
lock
the
outer
door
,
now
you
're
near
it
,
"
said
Bartle
,
getting
his
stick
in
the
fitting
angle
to
help
him
in
descending
from
his
stool
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
on
the
ground
than
it
became
obvious
why
the
stick
was
necessary
 
<EOS>
the
left
leg
was
much
shorter
than
the
right
.
<EOS>
But
the
school
-
master
was
so
active
with
his
lameness
that
it
was
hardly
thought
of
as
a
misfortune
;
and
if
you
had
seen
him
make
his
way
along
the
schoolroom
floor
,
and
up
the
step
into
his
kitchen
,
you
would
perhaps
have
understood
why
the
naughty
boys
sometimes
felt
that
his
pace
might
be
indefinitely
quickened
and
that
he
and
his
stick
might
overtake
them
even
in
their
swiftest
run
.
  
<EOS>
The
moment
he
appeared
at
the
kitchen
door
with
the
candle
in
his
hand
,
a
faint
whimpering
began
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
and
a
brown
-
and
-
tan
-
coloured
bitch
,
of
that
wise
-
looking
breed
with
short
legs
and
long
body
,
known
to
an
unmechanical
generation
as
turnspits
,
came
creeping
along
the
floor
,
wagging
her
tail
,
and
hesitating
at
every
other
step
,
as
if
her
affections
were
painfully
divided
between
the
hamper
in
the
chimney
-
corner
and
the
master
,
whom
she
could
not
leave
without
a
greeting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Vixen
,
well
then
,
how
are
the
babbies
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
schoolmaster
,
making
haste
towards
the
chimney
-
corner
and
holding
the
candle
over
the
low
hamper
,
where
two
extremely
blind
puppies
lifted
up
their
heads
towards
the
light
from
a
nest
of
flannel
and
wool
.
<EOS>
Vixen
could
not
even
see
her
master
look
at
them
without
painful
excitement
:
she
got
into
the
hamper
and
got
out
again
the
next
moment
,
and
behaved
with
true
feminine
folly
,
though
looking
all
the
while
as
wise
as
a
dwarf
with
a
large
old
-
fashioned
head
and
body
on
the
most
abbreviated
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
've
got
a
family
,
I
see
,
Mr.
Massey
?
"
said
Adam
,
smiling
,
as
he
came
into
the
kitchen
.
<EOS>
"
How
's
that
?
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
against
the
law
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Law
?
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
o
'
law
when
a
man
's
once
such
a
fool
as
to
let
a
woman
into
his
house
?
<EOS>
"
said
Bartle
,
turning
away
from
the
hamper
with
some
bitterness
.
<EOS>
He
always
called
Vixen
a
woman
,
and
seemed
to
have
lost
all
consciousness
that
he
was
using
a
figure
of
speech
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
known
Vixen
was
a
woman
,
I
'd
never
have
held
the
boys
from
drowning
her
;
but
when
I
'd
got
her
into
my
hand
,
I
was
forced
to
take
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
see
what
she
's
brought
me
to
 
the
sly
,
hypocritical
wench
"
 
<EOS>
Bartle
spoke
these
last
words
in
a
rasping
tone
of
reproach
,
and
looked
at
Vixen
,
who
poked
down
her
head
and
turned
up
her
eyes
towards
him
with
a
keen
sense
of
opprobrium
 
"
and
contrived
to
be
brought
to
bed
on
a
Sunday
at
church
-
time
.
<EOS>
I
've
wished
again
and
again
<EOS>
I
'd
been
a
bloody
minded
man
,
that
I
could
have
strangled
the
mother
and
the
brats
with
one
cord
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
it
was
no
worse
<EOS>
a
cause
kept
you
from
church
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
afraid
you
must
be
ill
for
the
first
time
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
your
life
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
particularly
sorry
not
to
have
you
at
church
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
boy
,
I
know
why
,
I
know
why
,
"
said
Bartle
kindly
,
going
up
to
Adam
and
raising
his
hand
up
to
the
shoulder
that
was
almost
on
a
level
with
his
own
head
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
had
a
rough
bit
o
'
road
to
get
over
since
I
saw
you
 
a
rough
bit
<EOS>
o
'
road
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
in
hopes
there
are
better
times
coming
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
've
got
some
news
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
get
my
supper
first
,
for
I
'm
hungry
,
I
'm
hungry
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
,
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bartel
went
into
his
little
pantry
,
and
brought
out
an
excellent
home
-
baked
loaf
;
for
it
was
his
one
extravagance
in
these
dear
times
to
eat
bread
once
a
-
day
instead
of
oat
-
cake
;
and
he
justified
it
by
observing
,
that
what
a
schoolmaster
wanted
was
brains
,
and
oat
-
cake
ran
too
much
to
bone
instead
of
brains
.
<EOS>
Then
came
a
piece
of
cheese
and
a
quart
jug
with
a
crown
of
foam
upon
it
.
<EOS>
He
placed
them
all
on
the
round
deal
table
which
stood
against
his
large
arm
-
chair
in
the
chimney
-
corner
,
with
Vixen
's
hamper
on
one
side
of
it
and
a
window
-
shelf
with
a
few
books
piled
up
in
it
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
The
table
was
as
clean
as
if
Vixen
had
been
an
excellent
housewife
in
a
checkered
apron
;
so
was
the
quarry
floor
;
and
the
old
carved
oaken
press
,
table
,
and
chairs
,
which
in
these
days
would
be
bought
at
a
high
price
in
aristocratic
houses
,
though
,
in
that
period
of
spider
-
legs
and
inlaid
cupids
,
Bartle
had
got
them
for
an
old
song
,
where
as
free
from
dust
as
things
could
be
at
the
end
of
a
summer
's
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
my
boy
,
draw
up
,
draw
up
.
<EOS>
We
'll
not
talk
about
business
till
we
've
had
our
supper
.
<EOS>
No
man
can
be
wise
on
an
empty
stomach
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
said
Bartle
,
rising
from
his
chair
again
,
"
I
must
give
Vixen
her
supper
too
,
confound
her
!
<EOS>
Though
she
'll
do
nothing
with
it
but
nourish
those
unnecessary
babbies
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
way
with
these
women
 
they
've
got
no
head
-
pieces
to
nourish
,
and
so
their
food
all
runs
either
to
fat
or
to
brats
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
brought
out
of
the
pantry
a
dish
of
scraps
,
which
Vixen
at
once
fixed
her
eyes
on
,
and
jumped
out
of
her
hamper
to
lick
up
with
the
utmost
dispatch
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
had
my
supper
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
<EOS>
so
I
'll
look
on
while
you
eat
yours
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
they
always
have
their
supper
betimes
,
you
know
:
they
do
n't
keep
your
late
hours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
little
about
their
hours
,
"
said
Bartle
dryly
,
cutting
his
bread
and
not
shrinking
from
the
crust
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
house
I
seldom
go
into
,
though
I
'm
fond
of
the
boys
,
and
Martin
Poyser
's
a
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
There
's
too
many
women
in
the
house
for
me
:
I
hate
the
sound
of
women
's
voices
;
they
're
always
either
a
-
buzz
or
a
-
squeak
 
always
either
a
-
buzz
or
a
-
squeak

<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
keeps
at
the
top
o

Nay

Mr.

said
Adam

who
took
his

's

more
seriously
than

to

night

hard

comfortable

"
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
It
's
the
silliest
lie
a
sensible
man
like
you
ever
believed
,
to
say
a
woman
makes
a
house
comfortable
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
story
got
up
because
the
women
are
there
and
something
must
be
found
for
'em
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
there
is
n't
a
thing
under
the
sun
that
needs
to
be
done
at
all
,
but
what
a
man
can
do
better
than
a
woman
,
unless
it
's
bearing
children
,
and
they
do
that
in
a

better

I
tell
you
,
a

bake
you
a
pie
every
week
of
her
life
and
never
come
to
see
that
the
hotter

the

<EOS>
I
tell
you
,
a
woman
'
ull
make
your
porridge
every
day
for
twenty
years
and
never
think
of
measuring
the
proportion
between
the
meal

the
milk
 
a
little
more
or
less
,
she
'll
think

<EOS>
The
porridge
WILL
be
awk'ard
now
and
then
:
if
it
's
wrong

it
's
summat
in

it

<EOS>
Look
at
me
!
<EOS>
I
make
my
own
bread
,
and
there
's
no
difference
between
one
batch
and
another
from
year
's
end
to
year
's
end
;
but
if
I
'd
got
any
other
woman
besides
Vixen
in
the
house
,
I
must
pray
to
the
Lord
every
baking
to
give
me
patience
if
the
bread
turned
out
heavy
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
cleanliness
,
my
house
is
cleaner
than
any
other
house
on

Common

though
the
half
of
'em
swarm

<EOS>
Will
Baker

comes
to
help
me
in

we
get
as
much
cleaning
done
in

hour

without
any
fuss

<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
about
God
having
made
such
creatures

be
companions

<EOS>
I
do
n't
say
but
<EOS>
He
might
make
Eve
to
be
a
companion
to
Adam
in
Paradise
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
cooking
to
be
spoilt
there

no

cackle
with
and
make
mischief
,
though
you
see
what
mischief
she
did
as
soon
as
she
'd
an
opportunity

<EOS>
But
it
's
an
impious
,
unscriptural
opinion
to
say
a
woman
's
a
blessing
to
a
man
now
;
you
might
as
well
say
adders
and
wasps
,
and
foxes

wild
beasts
are
a
blessing
,
when
they
're
only
the
evils
that
belong
to
this
state

probation
,
which
it
's
lawful
for
a
man
to
keep

<EOS>
Bartle
had
become
so
excited
and
angry
in
the
course
of
his
invective
that
he
had
forgotten
his
supper
,
and
only
used
the
knife
for
the
purpose
of
rapping
the
table
with
the
haft
.
<EOS>
But
towards
the
close
,
the
raps
became
so
sharp
and
frequent
,
and
his
voice
so
quarrelsome
,
that
Vixen
felt
it
incumbent
on
her
to
jump
out
of
the
hamper
and
bark
vaguely
.
  
<EOS>
"
Quiet
,
Vixen
!
"
snarled
Bartle
,
turning
round
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
like
the
rest
o
'
<EOS>
the
women
 
always
putting
in
your
word
before
you
know
why
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Vixen
returned
to
her
hamper
again
in
humiliation
,
and
her
master
continued
his
supper
in
a
silence
which
Adam
did
not
choose
to
interrupt
;
he
knew
the
old
man
would
be
in
a
better
humour
when
he
had
had
his
supper
and
lighted
his
pipe
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
used
to
hear
him
talk
in
this
way
,
but
had
never
learned
so
much
of
Bartle
's
past
life
as
to
know
whether
his
view
of
married
comfort
was
founded
on
experience
.
<EOS>
On
that
point
Bartle
was
mute
,
and
it
was
even
a
secret
where
he
had
lived
previous
to
the
twenty
years
in
which
happily
for
the
peasants
and
artisans
of
this
neighbourhood
he
had
been
settled
among
them
as
their
only
schoolmaster
.
<EOS>
If
anything
like
a
question
was
ventured
on
this
subject
,
Bartle
always
replied
,
"
Oh
,
I
've
seen
many
places
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
deal
in
the
south
,
"
and
the
Loamshire
men
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
asking
for
a
particular
town
or
village
in
Africa
as
in
"
the
south
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
my
boy
,
"
said
Bartle
,
at
last
,
when
he
had
poured
out
his
second
mug
of
ale
and
lighted
his
pipe
,
"
now
then
,
we
'll
have
a
little
talk
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
first
,
have
you
heard
any
particular
news
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
not
as
I
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
they
'll
keep
it
close
,
they
'll
keep
it
close
,
I
daresay
.
<EOS>
But
I
found
it
out
by
chance
;
and
it
's
news
that
may
concern
you
,
Adam
,
<EOS>
else
I
'm
a
man
that
do
n't
know
a
superficial
square
foot
from
a
solid
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Bartle
gave
a
series
of
fierce
and
rapid
puffs
,
looking
earnestly
the
while
at
Adam
.
<EOS>
Your
impatient
loquacious
man
has
never
any
notion
of
keeping
his
pipe
alight
by
gentle
measured
puffs
;
he
is
always
letting
it
go
nearly
out
,
and
then
punishing
it
for
that
negligence
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
said
,
"
Satchell
's
got
a
paralytic
stroke
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
out
from
the
lad
they
sent
to
Treddleston
for
the
doctor
,
before
seven
o'clock
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
good
way
beyond
sixty
,
you
know
;
it
's
much
if
he
gets
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
daresay
there
'd
be
more
rejoicing
than
sorrow
in
the
parish
at
his
being
laid
up
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
a
selfish
,
tale
-
bearing
,
mischievous
fellow
;
but
,
after
all
,
there
's
nobody
he
's
done
so
much
harm
to
as
to
th
'
old
squire
.
<EOS>
Though
it
's
the
squire
himself
as
is
to
blame
 
making
a
stupid
fellow
like
that
a
sort
o
'
man
-
of
-
all
-
work
,
just
to
save
th
'
expense
of
having
a
proper
steward
to
look
after
th
'
estate
.
<EOS>
And
he
's
lost
more
by
ill
management
o
'
<EOS>
the
woods
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
than
'
ud
pay
for
two
stewards
.
<EOS>
If
he
's
laid
on
the
shelf
,
it
's
to
be
hoped
he
'll
make
way
for
a
better
man
,
but
I
do
n't
see
how
it
's
like
to
make
any
difference
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
see
it
,
but
I
see
it
,
"
said
Bartle
,
"
and
others
besides
me
.
<EOS>
The
captain
's
coming
of
age
now
 
<EOS>
you
know
that
as
well
as
I
do
 
<EOS>
and
it
's
to
be
expected
he
'll
have
a
little
more
voice
in
things
.
<EOS>
And
I
know
,
<EOS>
and
you
know
too
,
what
'
ud
be
the
captain
's
wish
about
the
woods
,
if
there
was
a
fair
opportunity
for
making
a
change
.
<EOS>
He
's
said
in
plenty
of
people
's
hearing
that
he
'd
make
you
manager
of
the
woods
to
-
morrow
,
if
he
'd
the
power
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Carroll
,
Mr.
Irwine
's
butler
,
heard
him
say
so
to
the
parson
not
many
days
ago
.
<EOS>
Carroll
looked
in
when
we
were
smoking
our
pipes
o
'
<EOS>
Saturday
night
at
Casson
's
,
and
he
told
us
about
it
;
and
whenever
anybody
says
a
good
word
for
you
,
the
parson
's
ready
to
back
it
,
that
I
'll
answer
for
.
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
well
talked
over
<EOS>
,
I
can
tell
you
,
at
Casson
's
,
and
one
and
another
had
their
fling
at
you
;
for
if
donkeys
set
to
work
to
sing
,
you
're
pretty
sure
what
the
tune'll
be
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
did
they
talk
it
over
before
Mr.
Burge
?
"
said
Adam
;
"
or
was
n't
he
there
o
'
Saturday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
he
went
away
before
Carroll
came
;
and
Casson
 
<EOS>
he
's
always
for
setting
other
folks
right
,
you
know
 
would
have
it
<EOS>
Burge
was
the
man
to
have
the
management
of
the
woods
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
substantial
man
,
"
says
he
,
"
with
pretty
near
sixty
years
'
experience
o
'
timber
:
it
'
ud
be
all
very
well
for
Adam
Bede
to
act
under
him
,
but
it
is
n't
to
be
supposed
the
squire
'
ud
appoint
a
young
fellow
like
Adam
,
<EOS>
when
there
's
his
elders
and
betters
at
hand
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
said
,
"
That
's
a
pretty
notion
o
'
yours
,
Casson
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Burge
is
the
man
to
buy
timber
;
would
you
put
the
woods
into
his
hands
and
let
him
make
his
own
bargains
?
<EOS>
I
think
you
do
n't
leave
your
customers
to
score
their
own
drink
,
do
you
?
<EOS>
And
as
for
age
,
what
that
's
worth
depends
on
the
quality
o
'
the
liquor
.
<EOS>
It
's
pretty
well
known
who
's
the
backbone
of
Jonathan
Burge
's
business
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
I
thank
you
for
your
good
word
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
that
,
Casson
was
partly
i
'
the
right
for
once
.
<EOS>
There
's
not
much
likelihood
that
th
'
old
squire
'
ud
ever
consent
t
'
employ
me
.
<EOS>
I
offended
him
about
two
years
ago
,
and
he
's
never
forgiven
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
was
that
?
<EOS>
You
never
told
me
about
it
,
"
said
Bartle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
was
a
bit
o
'
nonsense
.
<EOS>
I
'd
made
a
frame
for
a
screen
for
Miss
Lyddy
 
<EOS>
she
's
allays
making
something
with
her
worsted
-
work
<EOS>
,
you
know
 
<EOS>
and
she
'd
given
me
particular
orders
about
this
screen
,
and
there
was
as
much
talking
and
measuring
as
if
we
'd
been
planning
a
house
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
a
nice
bit
o
'
work
,
and
I
liked
doing
it
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
,
you
know
,
those
little
friggling
things
take
a
deal
o
'
time
.
<EOS>
I
only
worked
at
it
in
overhours
 
often
late
at
night
 
<EOS>
and
I
had
to
go
to
Treddleston
over
an
'
over
again
about
little
bits
<EOS>
o
'
brass
nails
and
such
gear
;
and
I
turned
the
little
knobs
and
the
legs
,
and
carved
th
'
open
work
,
after
a
pattern
,
as
nice
as
could
be
.
<EOS>
And
I
was
uncommon
pleased
with
it
when
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
took
it
home
,
Miss
Lyddy
sent
for
me
to
bring
it
into
her
drawing
-
room
,
so
as
she
might
give
me
directions
about
fastening
on
the
work
 
<EOS>
very
fine
needlework
,
Jacob
and
Rachel
a
-
kissing
one
another
among
the
sheep
,
like
a
picture
 
and
th
<EOS>
'
old
squire
was
sitting
there
,
for
he
mostly
sits
with
her
.
<EOS>
Well
,
she
was
mighty
pleased
with
the
screen
,
and
then
she
wanted
to
know
what
pay
<EOS>
she
was
to
give
me
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
speak
at
random
 
<EOS>
you
know
it
's
not
my
way
;
I
'd
calculated
pretty
close
,
though
I
had
n't
made
out
a
bill
,
and
I
said
,
"
One
pound
thirty
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
paying
for
the
mater'als
and
paying
me
,
but
none
too
much
,
for
my
work
.
<EOS>
Th
'
old
squire
looked
up
at
this
,
and
peered
in
his
way
at
the
screen
,
and
said
,
"
One
pound
thirteen
for
a
gimcrack
like
that
!
<EOS>
Lydia
,
my
dear
,
if
you
must
spend
money
on
these
things
,
why
do
n't
you
get
them
at
Rosseter
,
instead
of
paying
double
price
for
clumsy
work
here
?
<EOS>
Such
things
are
not
work
for
a
carpenter
like
Adam
.
<EOS>
Give
him
a
guinea
,
and
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Miss
Lyddy
,
I
reckon
,
believed
what
he
told
her
,
and
she
's
not
overfond
<EOS>
o
'
parting
with
the
money
herself
 
<EOS>
she
's
not
a
bad
woman
at
bottom
,
but
she
's
been
brought
up
under
his
thumb
;
so
she
began
fidgeting
with
her
purse
,
and
turned
as
red
as
her
ribbon
.
<EOS>
But
I
made
a
bow
,
and
said
,
"
No
,
thank
you
,
madam
;
I
'll
make
you
a
present
o
'
the
screen
,
if
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
've
charged
the
regular
price
for
my
work
,
and
I
know
it
's
done
well
;
and
I
know
,
begging
His
Honour
's
pardon
,
that
you
could
n't
get
such
a
screen
at
Rosseter
under
two
guineas
.
<EOS>
I
'm
willing
to
give
you
my
work
 
<EOS>
it
's
been
done
in
my
own
time
,
and
nobody
's
got
anything
to
do
with
it
<EOS>
but
me
<EOS>
;
but
if
I
'm
paid
,
I
ca
n't
take
a
smaller
price
than
I
asked
,
because
that
'
ud
be
like
saying
I
'd
asked
more
than
was
just
.
<EOS>
With
your
leave
,
madam
,
I
'll
bid
you
good
-
morning
.
<EOS>
"
I
made
my
bow
and
went
out
before
she
'd
time
to
say
any
more
,
for
she
stood
with
the
purse
in
her
hand
,
looking
almost
foolish
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
mean
to
be
disrespectful
,
and
I
spoke
as
polite
as
I
could
;
but
I
can
give
in
to
no
man
,
if
he
wants
to
make
it
out
as
I
'm
trying
to
overreach
him
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
evening
the
footman
brought
me
the
one
pound
thirteen
wrapped
in
paper
.
<EOS>
But
since
then
I
've
seen
pretty
clear
as
th
'
old
squire
ca
n't
abide
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
likely
enough
,
that
's
likely
enough
,
"
said
Bartle
meditatively
.
<EOS>
"
The
only
way
to
bring
him
round
would
be
to
show
him
what
was
for
his
own
interest
,
and
that
the
captain
may
do
 
that
the
captain
may
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
I
do
n't
know
,
"
said
Adam
;
"
the
squire
's
'
cute
enough
<EOS>
but
it
takes
something
else
besides
'
cuteness
to
make
folks
see
what
'll
be
their
interest
in
the
long
run
.
<EOS>
It
takes
some
conscience
and
belief
in
right
and
wrong
,
I
see
that
pretty
clear
.
<EOS>
You
'd
hardly
ever
bring
round
th
'
old
squire
to
believe
he
'd
gain
as
much
in
a
straightfor'ard
way
as
by
tricks
and
turns
.
<EOS>
And
,
besides
,
I
've
not
much
mind
to
work
under
him
<EOS>
:
I
do
n't
want
to
quarrel
with
any
gentleman
,
<EOS>
more
particular
an
old
gentleman
turned
eighty
,
and
<EOS>
I
know
we
could
n't
agree
long
.
<EOS>
If
the
captain
was
master
o
'
th
'
estate
,
it
'
ud
be
different
:
he
's
got
a
conscience
and
a
will
to
do
right
,
and
I
'd
sooner
work
for
him
nor
for
any
man
living
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
my
boy
,
if
good
luck
knocks
at
your
door
,
do
n't
you
put
your
head
out
at
window
and
tell
it
to
be
gone
about
its
business
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
You
must
learn
to
deal
with
odd
and
even
in
life
,
as
well
as
in
figures
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
now
,
as
I
told
you
ten
years
ago
,
when
you
pommelled
young
Mike
Holdsworth
for
wanting
to
pass
a
bad
shilling
before
you
knew
whether
he
was
in
jest
or
earnest
 
<EOS>
you
're
overhasty
and
proud
,
and
apt
to
set
your
teeth
against
folks
that
do
n't
square
to
your
notions
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
harm
for
me
to
be
a
bit
fiery
and
stiff
-
backed
 
<EOS>
I
'm
an
old
schoolmaster
,
and
shall
never
want
to
get
on
to
a
higher
perch
.
<EOS>
But
where
's
the
use
of
all
the
time
I
've
spent
in
teaching
you
writing
and
mapping
and
mensuration
,
if
you
're
not
to
get
for'ard
in
the
world
and
show
folks
there
's
some
advantage
in
having
a
head
on
your
shoulders
,
instead
of
a
turnip
?
<EOS>
Do
you
mean
to
go
on
turning
up
your
nose
at
every
opportunity
because
it
's
got
a
bit
of
a
smell
about
it
that
nobody
finds
out
but
yourself
?
<EOS>
It
's
as
foolish
as
that
notion
<EOS>
o
'
yours
that
a
wife
is
to
make
a
working
-
man
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
<EOS>
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
<EOS>
Leave
that
to
fools
that
never
got
beyond
a
sum
in
simple
addition
.
<EOS>
Simple
addition
enough
!
<EOS>
Add
one
fool
to
another
fool
,
and
in
six
years
'
time
six
fools
more
 
<EOS>
they
're
all
of
the
same
denomination
,
big
and
little
's
nothing
to
do
with
the
sum
!
"
  
<EOS>
During
this
rather
heated
exhortation
to
coolness
and
discretion
the
pipe
had
gone
out
,
and
Bartle
gave
the
climax
to
his
speech
by
striking
a
light
furiously
,
after
which
he
puffed
with
fierce
resolution
,
fixing
his
eye
still
on
Adam
,
who
was
trying
not
to
laugh
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
a
good
deal
o
'
sense
in
what
you
say
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
Adam
began
,
as
soon
as
he
felt
quite
serious
,
"
as
there
always
is
.
<EOS>
But
you
'll
give
in
<EOS>
that
it
's
no
business
o
'
mine
to
be
building
on
chances
that
may
never
happen
.
<EOS>
What
I
've
got
to
do
is
to
work
as
well
as
I
can
with
the
tools
and
mater'als
<EOS>
I
've
got
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
If
a
good
chance
comes
to
me
,
I
'll
think
o
'
what
you
've
been
saying
;
but
till
then
,
I
've
got
nothing
to
do
but
to
trust
to
my
own
hands
and
my
own
head
-
piece
.
<EOS>
I
'm
turning
over
a
little
plan
for
Seth
and
me
to
go
into
the
cabinet
-
making
a
bit
by
ourselves
,
and
win
a
extra
pound
or
two
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
getting
late
now
 
<EOS>
it
'll
be
pretty
near
eleven
before
I
'm
at
home
,
and
Mother
may
happen
to
lie
awake
;
she
's
more
fidgety
nor
usual
now
.
<EOS>
So
I
'll
bid
you
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
we
'll
go
to
the
gate
with
you
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
fine
night
,
"
said
Bartle
,
taking
up
his
stick
.
<EOS>
Vixen
was
at
once
on
her
legs
,
and
without
further
words
the
three
walked
out
into
the
starlight
,
by
the
side
of
Bartle
's
potato
-
beds
,
to
the
little
gate
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
to
the
music
o
'
Friday
night
,
if
you
can
,
my
boy
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
as
he
closed
the
gate
after
Adam
and
leaned
against
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Adam
,
striding
along
towards
the
streak
of
pale
road
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
only
object
moving
on
the
wide
common
.
<EOS>
The
two
grey
donkeys
,
just
visible
in
front
of
the
gorse
bushes
,
stood
as
still
as
limestone
images
 
as
still
as
the
grey
-
thatched
roof
of
the
mud
cottage
a
little
farther
on
.
<EOS>
Bartle
kept
his
eye
on
the
moving
figure
till
it
passed
into
the
darkness
,
while
Vixen
,
in
a
state
of
divided
affection
,
had
twice
run
back
to
the
house
to
bestow
a
parenthetic
lick
on
her
puppies
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
muttered
the
schoolmaster
,
as
Adam
disappeared
,
"
there
you
go
,
stalking
along
 
stalking
along

but
you
would
n't
have
been
what
you
are

you
had
n't
had
a
bit
of
old
lame
Bartle
inside
you

The

<EOS>
(
Here
Vixen
tucked
her
tail
between

ran
forward
into

Bartle

Going
to
the
Birthday
Feast
  
<EOS>
THE
thirtieth
of
July
was
come
,
and
it
was
one
of
those
half
-
dozen
warm
days
which
sometimes
occur
in
the
middle
of
a
rainy
English
summer
.
<EOS>
No
rain
had
fallen
for
the
last
three
or
four
days
,
and
the
weather
was
perfect
for
that
time
of
the
year
:
there
was
less
dust
than
usual
on
the
dark
-
green
hedge
-
rows
and
on
the
wild
camomile
that
starred
the
roadside
,
yet
the
grass
was
dry
enough
for
the
little
children
to
roll
on
it
,
and
there
was
no
cloud
but
a
long
dash
of
light
,
downy
ripple
,
high
,
high
up
in
the
far
-
off
blue
sky
.
<EOS>
Perfect
weather
for
an
outdoor
July
merry
-
making
,
yet
surely
not
the
best
time
of
year
to
be
born
in
.
<EOS>
Nature
seems
to
make
a
hot
pause
just
then
:
all
the
loveliest
flowers
are
gone
;
the
sweet
time
of
early
growth
and
vague
hopes
is
past
;
and
yet
the
time
of
harvest
and
ingathering
is
not
come
,
and
we
tremble
at
the
possible
storms
that
may
ruin
the
precious
fruit
in
the
moment
of
its
ripeness
.
<EOS>
The
woods
are
all
one
dark
monotonous
green
;
the
waggon
-
loads
of
hay
no
longer
creep
along
the
lanes
,
scattering
their
sweet
-
smelling
fragments
on
the
blackberry
branches
;
the
pastures
are
often
a
little
tanned
,
yet
the
corn
has
not
got
its
last
splendour
of
red
and
gold
;
the
lambs
and
calves
have
lost
all
traces
of
their
innocent
frisky
prettiness
,
and
have
become
stupid
young
sheep
and
cows
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
a
time
of
leisure
on
the
farm
 
<EOS>
that
pause
between
hay
-
and
corn
-
harvest
,
and
<EOS>
so
the
farmers
and
labourers
in
Hayslope
and
Broxton
thought
the
captain
did
well
to
come
of
age
just
then
,
when
they
could
give
their
undivided
minds
to
the
flavour
of
the
great
cask
of
ale
which
had
been
brewed
the
autumn
after
"
the
heir
"
was
born
,
and
was
to
be
tapped
on
his
twenty
-
first
birthday
.
<EOS>
The
air
had
been
merry
with
the
ringing
of
church
-
bells
very
early
this
morning
,
and
every
one
had
made
haste
to
get
through
the
needful
work
before
twelve
,
when
it
would
be
time
to
think
of
getting
ready
to
go
to
the
Chase
.
  
<EOS>
The
midday
sun
was
streaming
into
Hetty
's
bedchamber
,
and
there
was
no
blind
to
temper
the
heat
with
which
it
fell
on
her
head
as
she
looked
at
herself
in
the
old
specked
glass
.
<EOS>
Still
,
that
was
the
only
glass
she
had
in
which
she
could
see
her
neck
and
arms
,
for
the
small
hanging
glass
she
had
fetched
out
of
the
next
room
 
<EOS>
the
room
that
had
been
Dinah
's
 
would
show
her
nothing
below
her
little
chin
;
and
that
beautiful
bit
of
neck
where
the
roundness
of
her
cheek
melted
into
another
roundness
shadowed
by
dark
delicate
curls
.
<EOS>
And
to
-
day
she
thought
more
than
usual
about
her
neck
and
arms
;
for
at
the
dance
this
evening
she
was
not
to
wear
any
neckerchief
,
and
she
had
been
busy
yesterday
with
her
spotted
pink
-
and
-
white
frock
,
that
she
might
make
the
sleeves
either
long
or
short
at
will
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressed
now
just
as
she
was
to
be
in
the
evening
,
with
a
tucker
made
of
"
real
"
lace
,
which
her
aunt
had
lent
her
for
this
unparalleled
occasion
,
but
with
no
ornaments
besides
;
she
had
even
taken
out
her
small
round
ear
-
rings
which
she
wore
every
day
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
something
more
to
be
done
,
apparently
,
before
she
put
on
her
neckerchief
and
long
sleeves
,
which
she
was
to
wear
in
the
day
-
time
,
for
now
she
unlocked
the
drawer
that
held
her
private
treasures
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
than
a
month
since
we
saw
her
unlock
that
drawer
before
,
and
now
it
holds
new
treasures
,
so
much
more
precious
than
the
old
ones
that
these
are
thrust
into
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Hetty
would
not
care
to
put
the
large
coloured
glass
ear
-
rings
into
her
ears
now
;
for
see
!
<EOS>
she
has
got
a
beautiful
pair
of
gold
and
pearls
and
garnet
,
lying
snugly
in
a
pretty
little
box
lined
with
white
satin
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
the
delight
of
taking
out
that
little
box
and
looking
at
the
ear
-
rings
!
<EOS>
Do
not
reason
about
it
,
my
philosphical
reader
,
and
say
that
Hetty
,
being
very
pretty
,
must
have
known
that
it
did
not
signify
whether
she
had
on
any
ornaments
or
not
;
and
that
,
moreover
,
to
look
at
ear
-
rings
which
she
could
not
possibly
wear
out
of
her
bedroom
could
hardly
be
a
satisfaction
,
the
essence
of
vanity
being
a
reference
to
the
impressions
produced
on
others
;
you
will
never
understand
women
's
natures
if
you
are
so
excessively
rational
.
<EOS>
Try
rather
to
divest
yourself
of
all
your
rational
prejudices
,
as
much
as
if
you
were
studying
the
psychology
of
a
canary
bird
,
and
only
watch
the
movements
of
this
pretty
round
creature
as
she
turns
her
head
on
one
side
with
an
unconscious
smile
at
the
ear
-
rings
nestled
in
the
little
box
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
you
think
,
it
is
for
the
sake
of
the
person
who
has
given
them
to
her
,
and
her
thoughts
are
gone
back
now
to
the
moment
when
they
were
put
into
her
hands
.
<EOS>
No
;
else
why
should
she
have
cared
to
have
ear
-
rings
rather
than
anything
else
?
<EOS>
And
I
know
that
she
had
longed
for
ear
-
rings
from
among
all
the
ornaments
she
could
imagine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Little
,
little
ears

Arthur
had
said
,
pretending
to
pinch
them
one
evening
,
as
Hetty
sat
beside
him
on
the
grass
without
her
hat
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
some
pretty
ear
-
rings
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
in
a
moment
,
almost
before
she
knew
what
she
was
saying
 
the
wish
lay
so
close
to
her
lips
,
it
WOULD
flutter
past
them
at
the
slightest
breath
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
day
 
it
was
only
last
week
 
Arthur
had
ridden
over
to
Rosseter
on
purpose
to
buy
them
.
<EOS>
That
little
wish
so
naively
uttered
seemed
to
him
the
prettiest
bit
of
childishness
;
he
had
never
heard
anything
like
it
before
;
and
he
had
wrapped
the
box
up
in
a
great
many
covers
,
that
he
might
see
Hetty
unwrapping
it
with
growing
curiosity
,
till
at
last
her
eyes
flashed
back
their
new
delight
into
his
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
she
was
not
thinking
most
of
the
giver
when
she
smiled
at
the
ear
-
rings
,
for
now
she
is
taking
them
out
of
the
box
,
not
to
press
them
to
her
lips
,
but
to
fasten
them
in
her
ears
 
only
for
one
moment
,
to
see
how
pretty
they
look
,
as
she
peeps
at
them
in
the
glass
against
the
wall
,
with
first
one
position
of
the
head
and
then
another
,
like
a
listening
bird
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
be
wise
on
the
subject
of
ear
-
rings
as
one
looks
at
her
;
what
should
those
delicate
pearls
and
crystals
be
made
for
,
if
not
for
such
ears
?
<EOS>
One
can
not
even
find
fault
with
the
tiny
round
hole
which
they
leave
when
they
are
taken
out
;
perhaps
water
-
nixies
,
and
such
lovely
things
without
souls
,
have
these
little
round
holes
in
their
ears
by
nature
,
ready
to
hang
jewels
in
.
<EOS>
And
Hetty
must
be
one
of
them
<EOS>
:
it
is
too
painful
to
think
that
she
is
a
woman
,
with
a
woman
's
destiny
before
her
 
<EOS>
a
woman
spinning
in
young
ignorance
a
light
web
of
folly
and
vain
hopes
which
may
one
day
close
round
her
and
press
upon
her
,
a
rancorous
poisoned
garment
,
changing
all
at
once
her
fluttering
,
trivial
butterfly
sensations
into
a
life
of
deep
human
anguish
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
can
not
keep
in
the
ear
-
rings
long
,
<EOS>
else
she
may
make
her
uncle
and
aunt
wait
.
<EOS>
She
puts
them
quickly
into
the
box
again
and
shuts
them
up
.
<EOS>
Some
day
she
will
be
able
to
wear
any
ear
-
rings
she
likes
,
and
already
she
lives
in
an
invisible
world
of
brilliant
costumes
,
shimmering
gauze
,
soft
satin
,
and
velvet
,
such
as
the
lady
's
maid
at
the
Chase
has
shown
her
in
Miss
Lydia
's
wardrobe
.
<EOS>
She
feels
the
bracelets
on
her
arms
,
and
treads
on
a
soft
carpet
in
front
of
a
tall
mirror
.
<EOS>
But
she
has
one
thing
in
the
drawer
which
she
can
venture
to
wear
to
-
day
,
because
she
can
hang
it
on
the
chain
of
dark
-
brown
berries
which
she
has
been
used
to
wear
on
grand
days
,
with
a
tiny
flat
scent
-
bottle
at
the
end
of
it
tucked
inside
her
frock
;
and
she
must
put
on
her
brown
berries
 
her
neck
would
look
so
unfinished
without
it
.
<EOS>
Hetty
was
not
quite
as
fond
of
the
locket
as
of
the
ear
-
rings
,
though
it
was
a
handsome
large
locket
,
with
enamelled
flowers
at
the
back
and
a
beautiful
gold
border
round
the
glass
,
which
showed
a
light
-
brown
slightly
waving
lock
,
forming
a
background
for
two
little
dark
rings
.
<EOS>
She
must
keep
it
under
her
clothes
,
and
no
one
would
see
it
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
had
another
passion
,
only
a
little
less
strong
than
her
love
of
finery
,
and
that
other
passion
made
her
like
to
wear
the
locket
even
hidden
in
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
She
would
always
have
worn
it
,
if
she
had
dared
to
encounter
her
aunt
's
questions
about
a
ribbon
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
So
now
she
slipped
it
on
along
her
chain
of
dark
-
brown
berries
,
and
snapped
the
chain
round
her
neck
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
very
long
chain
,
only
allowing
the
locket
to
hang
a
little
way
below
the
edge
of
her
frock
.
<EOS>
And
now
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
put
on
her
long
sleeves
,
her
new
white
gauze
neckerchief
,
and
<EOS>
her
straw
hat
trimmed
with
white
to
-
day
instead
of
the
pink
,
which
had
become
rather
faded
under
the
July
sun
.
<EOS>
That
hat
made
the
drop
of
bitterness
in
Hetty
's
cup
to
-
day
,
for
it
was
not
quite
new
 
<EOS>
everybody
would
see
that
it
was
a
little
tanned
against
the
white
ribbon
 
and
Mary
Burge
<EOS>
,
she
felt
sure
,
would
have
a
new
hat
or
bonnet
on
.
<EOS>
She
looked
for
consolation
at
her
fine
white
cotton
stockings
:
they
really
were
very
nice
indeed
,
and
she
had
given
almost
all
her
spare
money
for
them
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
dream
of
the
future
could
not
make
her
insensible
to
triumph
in
the
present
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
Captain
Donnithorne
loved
her
so
that
he
would
never
care
about
looking
at
other
people
,
but
then
those
other
people
did
n't
know
how
he
loved
her
,
and
she
was
not
satisfied
to
appear
shabby
and
insignificant
in
their
eyes
even
for
a
short
space
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
party
was
assembled
in
the
house
-
place
when
Hetty
went
down
,
all
of
course
in
their
Sunday
clothes
;
and
the
bells
had
been
ringing
so
this
morning
in
honour
of
the
captain
's
twenty
-
first
birthday
,
and
the
work
had
all
been
got
done
so
early
,
that
Marty
and
Tommy
were
not
quite
easy
in
their
minds
until
their
mother
had
assured
them
that
going
to
church
was
not
part
of
the
day
's
festivities
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
had
once
suggested
that
the
house
should
be
shut
up
and
left
to
take
care
of
itself
;
"
for
,
"
said
he
,
"
there
's
no
danger
of
anybody
's
breaking
in
 
<EOS>
everybody'll
be
at
the
Chase
,
thieves
an
'
all
.
<EOS>
If
we
lock
th
'
house
up
,
all
the
men
can
go
<EOS>
:
it
's
a
day
<EOS>
they
wonna
see
twice
<EOS>
i
'
their
lives
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Poyser
answered
with
great
decision
:
"
I
never
left
the
house
to
take
care
of
itself
since
I
was
a
missis
,
and
I
never
will
.
<EOS>
There
's
been
ill
-
looking
tramps
enoo
'
about
the
place
this
last
week
,
to
carry
off
every
ham
an
'
every
spoon
we'n
got
;
and
they
all
collogue
together
,
them
tramps
,
as
it
's
a
mercy
they
hanna
come
and
poisoned
the
dogs
and
murdered
us
all
in
our
beds
afore
we
knowed
,
some
Friday
night
when
we'n
got
the
money
in
th
'
house
to
pay
the
men
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
like
enough
<EOS>
the
tramps
know
where
we
're
going
as
well
as
we
do
oursens
;
for
if
Old
Harry
wants
any
work
done
,
you
may
be
sure
he
'll
find
the
means
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nonsense
about
murdering
us
in
our
beds
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
"
I
've
got
a
gun
<EOS>
i
'
our
room
,
hanna
I
?
<EOS>
and
thee'st
got
ears
as
'
ud
find
it
out
if
a
mouse
was
gnawing
the
bacon
.
<EOS>
Howiver
,
if
thee
wouldstna
be
easy
,
Alick
can
stay
at
home
<EOS>
i
'
the
forepart
o
'
the
day
,
and
Tim
can
come
back
tow'rds
five
o'clock
,
and
let
Alick
have
his
turn
.
<EOS>
They
may
let
Growler
loose
if
anybody
offers
to
do
mischief
,
and
there
's
Alick
's
dog
too
,
ready
enough
to
set
his
tooth
in
a
tramp
if
Alick
gives
him
a
wink
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
accepted
this
compromise
,
but
thought
it
advisable
to
bar
and
bolt
to
the
utmost
;
and
now
,
at
the
last
moment
before
starting
,
Nancy
,
the
dairy
-
maid
,
was
closing
the
shutters
of
the
house
-
place
,
although
the
window
,
lying
under
the
immediate
observation
of
Alick
and
the
dogs
,
might
have
been
supposed
the
least
likely
to
be
selected
for
a
burglarious
attempt
.
  
<EOS>
The
covered
cart
,
without
springs
,
was
standing
ready
to
carry
the
whole
family
except
the
men
-
servants
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
and
the
grandfather
sat
on
the
seat
in
front
,
and
within
there
was
room
for
all
the
women
and
children
;
the
fuller
the
cart
the
better
,
because
then
the
jolting
would
not
hurt
so
much
,
and
Nancy
's
broad
person
and
thick
arms
were
an
excellent
cushion
to
be
pitched
on
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Poyser
drove
at
no
more
than
a
walking
pace
,
that
there
might
be
as
little
risk
of
jolting
as
possible
on
this
warm
day
,
and
there
was
time
to
exchange
greetings
and
remarks
with
the
foot
-
passengers
who
were
going
the
same
way
,
specking
the
paths
between
the
green
meadows
and
the
golden
cornfields
with
bits
of
movable
bright
colour
 
a
scarlet
waistcoat
to
match
the
poppies
that
nodded
a
little
too
thickly
among
the
corn
,
or
a
dark
-
blue
neckerchief
with
ends
flaunting
across
a
brand
-
new
white
smock
-
frock
.
<EOS>
All
Broxton
and
all
Hayslope
were
to
be
at
the
Chase
,
and
make
merry
there
in
honour
of
"
th
'
heir
"
;
and
the
old
men
and
women
,
who
had
never
been
so
far
down
this
side
of
the
hill
for
the
last
twenty
years
,
were
being
brought
from
Broxton
and
Hayslope
in
one
of
the
farmer
's
waggons
,
at
Mr.
Irwine
's
suggestion
.
<EOS>
The
church
-
bells
had
struck
up
again
now
 
a
last
tune
,
before
the
ringers
came
down
the
hill
to
have
their
share
in
the
festival
;
and
before
the
bells
had
finished
,
other
music
was
heard
approaching
,
so
that
even
Old
Brown
,
the
sober
horse
that
was
drawing
Mr.
Poyser
's
cart
,
began
to
prick
up
his
ears
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
band
of
the
Benefit
Club
,
which
had
mustered
in
all
its
glory
 
that
is
to
say
,
in
bright
-
blue
scarfs
and
blue
favours
,
and
carrying
its
banner
with
the
motto
,
"
Let
brotherly
love
continue
,
"
encircling
a
picture
of
a
stone
-
pit
.
  
<EOS>
The
carts
,
of
course
,
were
not
to
enter
the
Chase
.
<EOS>
Every
one
must
get
down
at
the
lodges
,
and
the
vehicles
must
be
sent
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
Chase
is
like
a
fair
a'ready
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
she
got
down
from
the
cart
,
and
saw
the
groups
scattered
under
the
great
oaks
,
and
the
boys
running
about
in
the
hot
sunshine
to
survey
the
tall
poles
surmounted
by
the
fluttering
garments
that
were
to
be
the
prize
of
the
successful
climbers
.

There

"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

said
old
Martin
,
walking
slowly
under
the
shade
of
the
lodge
porch
,
from
which
he
could
see
the
aged
party
descend
.
<EOS>
"
I
remember
Jacob
Taft
walking
fifty
mile
after
the
Scotch
raybels
,
when
they
turned
back
from
Stoniton

"
  
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
quite
a
youngster
,
with
a
long
life
before
him
,
as
he
saw
the
Hayslope
patriarch
,
old
Feyther
Taft
,
descend
from
the
waggon
and
walk
towards
him
,
in
his
brown
nightcap
,
and
leaning
on
his
two
sticks
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mester
Taft
,
"
shouted
old
Martin
,
at
the
utmost
stretch
of
his
voice
 
for
though
he
knew
the
old
man
was
stone
deaf
<EOS>
,
he
could
not
omit
the
propriety
of
a
greeting
 
<EOS>
"
you

<EOS>
You

"
Your

said
Feyther
Taft
in
a
treble
tone
,
perceiving
that
he
was
in
company
.
  
<EOS>
The
aged
group
,
under
care
of
sons
or
daughters
,
themselves
worn
and
grey
,
passed
on
along
the
least
-
winding
carriage
-
road
towards
the
house
,
where
a
special
table
was
prepared
for
them
;
while
the
Poyser
party
wisely
struck
across
the
grass
under
the
shade
of
the
great
trees
,
but
not
out
of
view
of
the
house
-
front
,
with
its
sloping
lawn
and
flower
-
beds
,
or
of
the
pretty
striped
marquee
at
the
edge
of
the
lawn
,
standing
at
right
angles
with
two
larger
marquees
on
each
side
of
the
open
green
space
where
the
games
were
to
be
played
.
<EOS>
The
house
would
have
been
nothing
but
a
plain
square
mansion
of
Queen
Anne
's
time
,
but
for
the
remnant
of
an
old
abbey
to
which
it
was
united
at
one
end
,
in
much
the
same
way
as
one
may
sometimes
see
a
new
farmhouse
rising
high
and
prim
at
the
end
of
older
and
lower
farm
-
offices
.
<EOS>
The
fine
old
remnant
stood
a
little
backward
and
under
the
shadow
of
tall
beeches
,
but
the
sun
was
now
on
the
taller
and
more
advanced
front
,
the
blinds
were
all
down
,
and
the
house
seemed
asleep
in
the
hot
midday
.
<EOS>
It
made
Hetty
quite
sad
to
look
at
it
:
Arthur
must
be
somewhere
in
the
back
rooms
,
with
the
grand
company
,
where
he
could
not
possibly
know
that
she
was
come
,
and
she
should
not
see
him
for
a
long
,
long
while
 
not
till
after
dinner
,
when
they
said
he
was
to
come
up
and
make
a
speech
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hetty
was
wrong
in
part
of
her
conjecture
.
<EOS>
No
grand
company
was
come
except
the
Irwines
,
for
whom
the
carriage
had
been
sent
early
,
and
Arthur
was
at
that
moment
not
in
a
back
room
,
but
walking
with
the
rector
into
the
broad
stone
cloisters
of
the
old
abbey
,
where
the
long
tables
were
laid
for
all
the
cottage
tenants
and
the
farm
-
servants
.
<EOS>
A
very
handsome
young
Briton
he
looked
to
-
day
,
in
high
spirits
and
a
bright
-
blue
frock
-
coat
,
the
highest
mode
 
<EOS>
his
arm
no
longer
in
a
sling
.
<EOS>
So
open
-
looking
and
candid
,
too
;
but
candid
people
have
their
secrets
,
and
secrets
leave
no
lines
in
young
faces
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
,
"
he
said
,
as
they
entered
the
cool
cloisters
,
"
I
think
the
cottagers
have
the
best
of
it
:
these
cloisters
make
a
delightful
dining
-
room
on
a
hot
day
.
<EOS>
That
was
capital
advice
of
yours
,
Irwine
,
about
the
dinners
 
to
let
them
be
as
orderly
and
comfortable
as
possible
,
and
only
for
the
tenants
:
especially
as
I
had
only
a
limited
sum
after
all
;
for
though
my
grandfather
talked
of
a
carte
blanche
,
he
could
n't
make
up
his
mind
to
trust
me
,
when
it
came
to
the
point
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
mind
,
you
'll
give
more
pleasure
in
this
quiet
way
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
sort
of
thing
people
are
constantly
confounding
liberality
with
riot
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
It
sounds
very
grand
to
say
that
so
many
sheep
and
oxen
were
roasted
whole
,
and
everybody
ate
who
liked
to
come
;
but
in
the
end
it
generally
happens
that
no
one
has
had
an
enjoyable
meal
.
<EOS>
If
the
people
get
a
good
dinner
and
a
moderate
quantity
of
ale
in
the
middle
of
the
day
,
they
'll
be
able
to
enjoy
the
games
as
the
day
cools
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
hinder
some
of
them
from
getting
too
much
towards
evening
,
but
drunkenness
and
darkness
go
better
together
than
drunkenness
and
daylight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
hope
there
wo
n't
be
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
kept
the
Treddleston
people
away
by
having
a
feast
for
them
in
the
town
;
and
I
've
got
Casson
and
Adam
Bede
and
some
other
good
fellows
to
look
to
the
giving
out
of
ale
in
the
booths
,
and
to
take
care
things
do
n't
go
too
far
.
<EOS>
Come
,
let
us
go
up
above
now
and
see
the
dinner
-
tables
for
the
large
tenants
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
up
the
stone
staircase
leading
simply
to
the
long
gallery
above
the
cloisters
,
a
gallery
where
all
the
dusty
worthless
old
pictures
had
been
banished
for
the
last
three
generations
 
<EOS>
mouldy
portraits
of
Queen
Elizabeth
and
her
ladies
,
General
Monk
with
his
eye
knocked
out
,
Daniel
very
much
in
the
dark
among
the
lions
,
and
Julius
Caesar
on
horseback
,
with
a
high
nose
and
laurel
crown
,
holding
his
Commentaries
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
capital
thing
it
is
that
they
saved
this
piece
of
the
old
abbey
!
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
'm
ever
master
here
,
I
shall
do
up
the
gallery
in
first
-
rate
style
.
<EOS>
We
've
got
no
room
in
the
house
a
third
as
large
as
this
.
<EOS>
That
second
table
is
for
the
farmers
'
wives
and
children
:
Mrs.
Best
said
it
would
be
more
comfortable
for
the
mothers
and
children
to
be
by
themselves
.
<EOS>
I
was
determined
to
have
the
children
,
and
make
a
regular
family
thing
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
"
the
old
squire
"
to
those
little
lads
and
lasses
some
day
,
and
they
'll
tell
their
children
what
a
much
finer
young
fellow
<EOS>
I
was
than
my
own
son
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
table
for
the
women
and
children
below
as
well
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
see
them
all
 
you
will
come
up
with
me
after
dinner
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
miss
your
maiden
speech
to
the
tenantry
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
there
will
be
something
else
you
'll
like
to
hear
,
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
into
the
library
<EOS>
and
I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
while
my
grandfather
is
in
the
drawing
-
room
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
Something
that
will
surprise
you
,
"
he
continued
,
as
they
sat
down
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
grandfather
has
come
round
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
about
Adam
?
"
  
"
Yes
;
I
should
have
ridden
over
to
tell
you
about
it
,
only
I
was
so
busy
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
told
you
I
had
quite
given
up
arguing
the
matter
with
him
 
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
hopeless
 
<EOS>
but
yesterday
morning
he
asked
me
to
come
in
here
to
him
before
I
went
out
,
and
astonished
me
by
saying
that
he
had
decided
on
all
the
new
arrangements
he
should
make
in
consequence
of
old
Satchell
being
obliged
to
lay
by
work
,
and
that
he
intended
to
employ
Adam
in
superintending
the
woods
at
a
salary
of
a
guinea
a
-
week
,
and
the
use
of
a
pony
to
be
kept
here
.
<EOS>
I
believe
the
secret
of
it
is
,
he
saw
from
the
first
it
would
be
a
profitable
plan
,
but
he
had
some
particular
dislike
of
Adam
to
get
over
 
and
besides
,
the
fact
that
I
propose
a
thing
is
generally
a
reason
with
him
for
rejecting
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
the
most
curious
contradiction
in
my
grandfather
:
I
know
he
means
to
leave
me
all
the
money
he
has
saved
,
and
he
is
likely
enough
to
have
cut
off
poor
Aunt
Lydia
,
who
has
been
a
slave
to
him
all
her
life
,
with
only
five
hundred
a
-
year
,
for
the
sake
of
giving
me
all
the
more
;
and
yet
I
sometimes
think
he
positively
hates
me
because
I
'm
his
heir
.
<EOS>
I
believe
if
I
were
to
break
my
neck
,
he
would
feel
it
the
greatest
misfortune
that
could
befall
him
,
and
yet
it
seems
a
pleasure
to
him
to
make
my
life
a
series
of
petty
annoyances
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
boy
,
it
is
not
only
woman
's
love
that
is
[
two
greek
words
omitted
]
as
old
AEschylus
calls
it
.
<EOS>
There
's
plenty
of
"
unloving
love
"
in
the
world
of
a
masculine
kind
.
<EOS>
But
tell
me
about
Adam
.
<EOS>
Has
he
accepted
the
post
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
that
it
can
be
much
more
profitable
than
his
present
work
,
though
,
to
be
sure
,
it
will
leave
him
a
good
deal
of
time
on
his
own
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
felt
some
doubt
about
it
when
I
spoke
to
him
<EOS>
and
he
seemed
to
hesitate
at
first
.
<EOS>
His
objection
was
that
he
thought
he
should
not
be
able
to
satisfy
my
grandfather
.
<EOS>
But
I
begged
him
as
a
personal
favour
to
me
not
to
let
any
reason
prevent
him
from
accepting
the
place
,
if
he
really
liked
the
employment
and
would
not
be
giving
up
anything
that
was
more
profitable
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
he
assured
me
he
should
like
it
of
all
things
 
<EOS>
it
would
be
a
great
step
forward
for
him
in
business
,
and
it
would
enable
him
to
do
what
he
had
long
wished
to
do
,
to
give
up
working
for
Burge
.
<EOS>
He
says
he
shall
have
plenty
of
time
to
superintend
a
little
business
of
his
own
,
which
he
and
Seth
will
carry
on
,
and
will
perhaps
be
able
to
enlarge
by
degrees
.
<EOS>
So
he
has
agreed
at
last
,
and
I
have
arranged
that
he
shall
dine
with
the
large
tenants
to
-
day
;
and
I
mean
to
announce
the
appointment
to
them
,
and
ask
them
to
drink
Adam
's
health
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
little
drama
I
've
got
up
in
honour
of
my
friend
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
fine
fellow
,
and
I
like
the
opportunity
of
letting
people
know
that
I
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
A
drama
in
which
friend
Arthur
piques
himself
on
having
a
pretty
part
to
play
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
saw
Arthur
colour
,
he
went
on
relentingly
,
"
My
part
,
you
know
,
is
always
that
of
the
old
fogy
who
sees
nothing
to
admire
in
the
young
folks
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
admit
that
I
'm
proud
of
my
pupil
when
he
does
graceful
things
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
play
the
amiable
old
gentleman
for
once
,
and
second
your
toast
in
honour
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
Has
your
grandfather
yielded
on
the
other
point
too
,
and
agreed
to
have
a
respectable
man
as
steward
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
"
said
Arthur
,
rising
from
his
chair
with
an
air
of
impatience
and
walking
along
the
room
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
got
some
project
or
other
about
letting
the
Chase
Farm
and
bargaining
for
a
supply
of
milk
and
butter
for
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
I
ask
no
questions
about
it
 
<EOS>
it
makes
me
too
angry
.
<EOS>
I
believe
he
means
to
do
all
the
business
himself
,
and
have
nothing
in
the
shape
of
a
steward
.
<EOS>
It
's
amazing
what
energy
he
has
,
though
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
'll
go
to
the
ladies
now
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
rising
too
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
tell
my
mother
what
a
splendid
throne
you
've
prepared
for
her
under
the
marquee
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
we
must
be
going
to
luncheon
too
,
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
two
o'clock
,
for
there
is
the
gong
beginning
to
sound
for
the
tenants
'
dinners
.
"
    
<EOS>
Dinner
-
Time
  
<EOS>
WHEN
Adam
heard
that
he
was
to
dine
upstairs
with
the
large
tenants
,
he
felt
rather
uncomfortable
at
the
idea
of
being
exalted
in
this
way
above
his
mother
and
Seth
,
who
were
to
dine
in
the
cloisters
below
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Mills
,
the
butler
,
assured
him
that
Captain
Donnithorne
had
given
particular
orders
about
it
,
and
would
be
very
angry
if
Adam
was
not
there
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
nodded
and
went
up
to
Seth
,
who
was
standing
a
few
yards
off
.
<EOS>
"
Seth
,
lad
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
captain
has
sent
to
say
I
'm
to
dine
upstairs
 
<EOS>
he
wishes
it
particular
,
Mr.
Mills
says
,
<EOS>
so
I
suppose
it
'
ud
be
behaving
ill
for
me
not
to
go
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
like
sitting
up
above
thee
and
mother
,
as
if
I
was
better
than
my
own
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
Thee't
not
take
it
unkind
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
lad
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
thy
honour
's
our
honour
;
and
if
thee
get'st
respect
,
thee'st
won
it
by
thy
own
deserts

<EOS>
The
further
I
see
thee
above
me
,
the
better
,
so
long
as
thee
feel'st
like
a
brother
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
because
o
'
thy
being
appointed
over
the
woods
,
and
it
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
's
right
.
<EOS>
That
's
a
place
<EOS>
o
'
trust
,
and
thee't
above
a
common
workman
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
but
nobody
knows
a
word
about
it
yet
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
given
notice
to
Mr.
Burge
about
leaving
him
,
and
I
do
n't
like
to
tell
anybody
else
about
it
before
he
knows
,
for
he
'll
be
a
good
bit
hurt
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
People
'
ull
be
wondering
to
see
me
there
,
and
they
'll
like
enough
be
guessing
the
reason
and
asking
questions
,
<EOS>
for
there
's
been
so
much
talk
up
and
down
about
my
having
the
place
,
this
last
three
weeks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
thee
canst
say
thee
wast
ordered
to
come
without
being
told
the
reason
.
<EOS>
That
's
the
truth
.
<EOS>
And
mother
'
ull
be
fine
and
joyful
about
it
.
<EOS>
Let
's
go
and
tell
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
not
the
only
guest
invited
to
come
upstairs
on
other
grounds
than
the
amount
he
contributed
to
the
rent
-
roll
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
people
in
the
two
parishes
who
derived
dignity
from
their
functions
rather
than
from
their
pocket
,
and
of
these
Bartle
Massey
was
one
.
<EOS>
His
lame
walk
was
rather
slower
than
usual
on
this
warm
day
,
<EOS>
so
Adam
lingered
behind
when
the
bell
rang
for
dinner
,
that
he
might
walk
up
with
his
old
friend
;
for
he
was
a
little
too
shy
to
join
the
Poyser
party
on
this
public
occasion
.
<EOS>
Opportunities
of
getting
to
Hetty
's
side
would
be
sure
to
turn
up
in
the
course
of
the
day
,
and
Adam
contented
himself
with
that
for
he
disliked
any
risk
of
being
"
joked
"
about
Hetty
 
<EOS>
the
big
,
outspoken
,
fearless
man
was
very
shy
and
diffident
as
to
his
love
-
making
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mester
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
,
as
Bartle
came
up
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
to
dine
upstairs
with
you
to
-
day
:
the
captain
's
sent
me
orders
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
"
said
Bartle
,
pausing
,
with
one
hand
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
's
something
in
the
wind
 
<EOS>
there
's
something
in
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
anything
about
what
the
old
squire
means
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
yes
,
"
said
Adam
;
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
know
,
because
I
believe
you
can
keep
a
still
tongue
in
your
head
if
you
like

and
I
hope
you
'll
not
let
drop
a
word
till
it
's
common
talk

for
I
've
particular
reasons
against
its
being
known
.
<EOS>

<EOS>

Trust
to
me
,
my
boy
,
trust
to
me

<EOS>
I
've
got
no
wife
to
worm
it
out
of
me
and
then
run
out
and
cackle
it
in
everybody
's
hearing

<EOS>
If
you

"
Well
,
then
,
it
was
so
far
settled
yesterday
that
I
'm
to
take
the
management
o
'
the
woods
.
<EOS>
The
captain
sent
for
me
t
'
offer
it
me
,
when
I
was
seeing
to
the
poles
and
things
here
<EOS>
and
I
've
agreed
<EOS>
to't
.
<EOS>
But
if
anybody
asks
any
questions
upstairs
,
just
you
take
no
notice
,
and
turn
the
talk
to
something
else
,
and
I
'll
be
obliged
to
you
.
<EOS>
Now
,
let
us
go
on
,
for
we
're
pretty
nigh
<EOS>
the
last
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
to
do
,
never
fear
,
"
said
Bartle
,
moving
on
.
<EOS>
"
The
news
will
be
good
sauce
to
my
dinner
.
<EOS>
Aye
,
aye
,
my
boy
,
you
'll
get
on
.
<EOS>
I
'll
back
you
for
an
eye
at
measuring
and
a
head
-
piece
for
figures
,
against
any
man
in
this
county
and
you
've
had
good
teaching
 
<EOS>
you
've
had
good
teaching
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
got
upstairs
,
the
question
which
Arthur
had
left
unsettled
,
as
to
who
was
to
be
president
,
and
who
vice
,
was
still
under
discussion
,
so
that
Adam
's
entrance
passed
without
remark
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
stands
to
sense
,
"
Mr.
Casson
was
saying
,
"
as
old
Mr.
Poyser
,
as
is
th
'
oldest
man
i
'
<EOS>
the
room
,
should
sit
at
top
o
'
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
was
n't
butler
fifteen
year
without
learning
the
rights
and
the
wrongs
about
dinner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
old
Martin
,
"
I'n
gi'en
up
to
my
son
;
I
'm
no
tenant
now
:
let
my
son
take
my
place
.
<EOS>
Th
'
ould
foulks
ha
'
had
their
turn
:
they
mun
make
way
for
the
young
uns
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
ha
'
thought
the
biggest
tenant
had
the
best
right
,
more
nor
th
'
oldest
,
"
said
Luke
Britton
,
who
was
not
fond
of
the
critical
Mr.
Poyser
;
"
there
's
<EOS>
Mester
Holdsworth
has
more
land
nor
anybody
else
on
th
'
estate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
suppose
we
say
the
man
wi
'
the
foulest
land
shall
sit
at
top
;
then
whoever
gets
th
'
honour
,
there
'll
be
no
envying
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
here
's
Mester
Massey
,
"
said
Mr.
Craig
,
who
,
being
a
neutral
in
the
dispute
,
had
no
interest
but
in
conciliation
;
"
the
schoolmaster
ought
to
be
able
to
tell
you
what
's
right
.
<EOS>
Who
's
to
sit
at
top
o
'
<EOS>
the
table
,
Mr.
Massey
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
broadest
man
,
"
said
Bartle
;
"
and
then
he
wo
n't
take
up
other
folks
'
room
;
and
the
next
broadest
must
sit
at
bottom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
happy
mode
of
settling
the
dispute
produced
much
laughter
 
<EOS>
a
smaller
joke
would
have
sufficed
for
that
Mr.
Casson
,
however
,
did
not
feel
it
compatible
with
his
dignity
and
superior
knowledge
to
join
in
the
laugh
,
until
it
turned
out
that
he
was
fixed
on
as
the
second
broadest
man
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
the
younger
,
as
the
broadest
,
was
to
be
president
,
and
Mr.
Casson
,
as
next
broadest
,
was
to
be
vice
.
  
<EOS>
Owing
to
this
arrangement
,
Adam
,
being
,
of
course
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
fell
under
the
immediate
observation
of
Mr.
Casson
,
who
,
too
much
occupied
with
the
question
of
precedence
,
had
not
hitherto
noticed
his
entrance
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Casson
,
we
have
seen
,
considered
Adam
"
rather
lifted
up
and
peppery
-
like
"
:
he
thought
the
gentry
made
more
fuss
about
this
young
carpenter
than
was
necessary
;
they
made
no
fuss
about
Mr.
Casson
,
although
he
had
been
an
excellent
butler
for
fifteen
years
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mr.
Bede
,
you
're
one
o
'
<EOS>
them
as
mounts
hup'ards
apace
,
"
he
said
,
when
Adam
sat
down
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
niver
dined
here
before
,
as
I
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Mr.
Casson
,
"
said
Adam
,
in
his
strong
voice
,
that
could
be
heard
along
the
table
;
"
I
've
never
dined
here
before
,
but
I
come
by
Captain
Donnithorne
's
wish
,
and
I
hope
it
's
not
disagreeable
to
anybody
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
several
voices
at
once
,
"
we
're
glad
ye're
come
.
<EOS>
Who
's
got
anything
to
say
again
'
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
ye'll
sing
us
"
Over
the
hills
and
far
away
,
"
after
dinner
,
wonna
ye
?
"
said
Mr.
Chowne
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
song
I
'm
uncommon
fond
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Peeh
!
"
said
Mr.
Craig
;
"
it
's
not
to
be
named
by
side
o
'
the
Scotch
tunes
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
cared
about
singing
myself
;
I
've
had
something
better
to
do
.
<EOS>
A
man
that
's
got
<EOS>
the
names
and
the
natur
o
'
plants
in
's
head
isna
likely
to
keep
a
hollow
place
<EOS>
t
'
hold
tunes
in
.
<EOS>
But
a
second
cousin
o
'
mine
,
a
drovier
,
was
a
rare
hand
at
remembering
the
Scotch
tunes
.
<EOS>
He
'd
got
nothing
else
to
think
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
Scotch
tunes
!
"
said
Bartle
Massey
,
contemptuously
;
"
I
've
heard
enough
o
'
the
Scotch
tunes
to
last
me
while
I
live
.
<EOS>
They
're
fit
for
nothing
but
to
frighten
the
birds
with
 
that
's
to
say
,
the
English
birds
,
for
the
Scotch
birds
may
sing
Scotch
for
what
I
know
.
<EOS>
Give
the
lads
a
bagpipe
instead
of
a
rattle
,
and
I
'll
answer
for
it
<EOS>
the
corn
'll
be
safe
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
's
folks
as
find
a
pleasure
in
undervallying
what
they
know
but
little
about
,
"
said
Mr.
Craig
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
Scotch
tunes
are
just
like
a
scolding
,
nagging
woman
,
"
Bartle
went
on
,
without
deigning
to
notice
Mr.
Craig
's
remark
.
<EOS>
"
They
go
on
with
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
,
and
never
come
to
a
reasonable
end
.
<EOS>
Anybody
'
ud
think
the
Scotch
tunes
had
always
been
asking
a
question
of
somebody
as
deaf
as
old
Taft
,
and
had
never
got
an
answer
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
minded
the
less
about
sitting
by
Mr.
Casson
,
because
this
position
enabled
him
to
see
Hetty
,
who
was
not
far
off
him
at
the
next
table
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
however
,
had
not
even
noticed
his
presence
yet
,
for
she
was
giving
angry
attention
to
Totty
,
who
insisted
on
drawing
up
her
feet
on
to
the
bench
in
antique
fashion
,
and
thereby
threatened
to
make
dusty
marks
on
Hetty
's
pink
-
and
-
white
frock
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
were
the
little
fat
legs
pushed
down
than
up
<EOS>
they
came
again
,
for
Totty
's
eyes
were
too
busy
in
staring
at
the
large
dishes
to
see
where
the
plum
pudding
was
for
her
to
retain
any
consciousness
of
her
legs
.
<EOS>
Hetty
got
quite
out
of
patience
,
and
at
last
,
with
a
frown
and
pout
,
and
gathering
tears
,
she
said
,
"
Oh
dear
,
Aunt
,
I
wish
you
'd
speak
to
Totty
;
she
keeps
putting
her
legs
up
so
,
and
messing
my
frock
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
wi
'
the
child
?
<EOS>
She
can
niver
<EOS>
please
you
,
"
said
the
mother
.
<EOS>
"
Let
her
come
by
the
side
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
me
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
can
put
up
wi
'
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
looking
at
Hetty
,
and
saw
the
frown
,
and
pout
,
and
the
dark
eyes
seeming
to
grow
larger
with
pettish
half
-
gathered
tears
.
<EOS>
Quiet
Mary
Burge
,
who
sat
near
enough
to
see
that
Hetty
was
cross
and
that
Adam
's
eyes
were
fixed
on
her
,
thought
that
so
sensible
a
man
as
Adam
must
be
reflecting
on
the
small
value
of
beauty
in
a
woman
whose
temper
was
bad
.
<EOS>
Mary
was
a
good
girl
,
not
given
to
indulge
in
evil
feelings
,
but
she
said
to
herself
,
that
,
since
Hetty
had
a
bad
temper
,
it
was
better
Adam
should
know
it
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
quite
true
that
if
Hetty
had
been
plain
,
she
would
have
looked
very
ugly
and
unamiable
at
that
moment
,
and
no
one
's
moral
judgment
upon
her
would
have
been
in
the
least
beguiled
.
<EOS>
But
really
there
was
something
quite
charming
in
her
pettishness
<EOS>
:
it
looked
so
much
more
like
innocent
distress
than
ill
humour
;
and
the
severe
Adam
felt
no
movement
of
disapprobation
;
he
only
felt
a
sort
of
amused
pity
,
as
if
he
had
seen
a
kitten
setting
up
its
back
,
or
a
little
bird
with
its
feathers
ruffled
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
gather
what
was
vexing
her
,
but
it
was
impossible
to
him
to
feel
otherwise
than
that
she
was
the
prettiest
thing
in
the
world
,
and
that
if
he
could
have
his
way
,
nothing
should
ever
vex
her
any
more
.
<EOS>
And
presently
,
when
Totty
was
gone
,
she
caught
his
eye
,
and
her
face
broke
into
one
of
its
brightest
smiles
,
as
she
nodded
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bit
of
flirtation
 
<EOS>
she
knew
Mary
Burge
was
looking
at
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
smile
was
like
wine
to
Adam
.
    
<EOS>
The
Health
-
Drinking
  
<EOS>
WHEN
the
dinner
was
over
,
and
the
first
draughts
from
the
great
cask
of
birthday
ale
were
brought
up
,
room
was
made
for
the
broad
Mr.
Poyser
at
the
side
of
the
table
,
and
two
chairs
were
placed
at
the
head
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
settled
very
definitely
what
Mr.
Poyser
was
to
do
when
the
young
squire
should
appear
,
and
for
the
last
five
minutes
he
had
been
in
a
state
of
abstraction
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
dark
picture
opposite
,
and
his
hands
busy
with
the
loose
cash
and
other
articles
in
his
breeches
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
young
squire
entered
,
with
Mr.
Irwine
by
his
side
,
every
one
stood
up
,
and
this
moment
of
homage
was
very
agreeable
to
Arthur
.
<EOS>
He
liked
to
feel
his
own
importance
,
and
besides
that
,
he
cared
a
great
deal
for
the
good
-
will
of
these
people
<EOS>
:
he
was
fond
of
thinking
that
they
had
a
hearty
,
special
regard
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
pleasure
he
felt
was
in
his
face
as
he
said
,
"
My
grandfather
and
I
hope
all
our
friends
here
have
enjoyed
their
dinner
,
and
find
my
birthday
ale
good
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
and
I
are
come
to
taste
it
with
you
,
and
I
am
sure
we
shall
all
like
anything
the
better
that
the
rector
shares
with
us
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
now
turned
on
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
,
with
his
hands
still
busy
in
his
pockets
,
began
with
the
deliberateness
of
a
slow
-
striking
clock
.
"
<EOS>
Captain

my
neighbours

put
it

me

where

pretty
much

as
good
as
a

<EOS>
And
though

That
's
what
I
mean

that
's
what

<EOS>
An

I
'll
not

how
we
like
th

ale
yet
,
for
we
couldna
well
taste
it

the
dinner
was
good

if

Hereupon
a
glorious
shouting

a
rapping

a
jingling
,
a
clattering
,
and
a
shouting
,
with
plentiful
da
capo
,
pleasanter
than
a
strain
of
sublimest
music
in
the
ears
that
receive
such
a
tribute
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Arthur
had
felt
a
twinge
of
conscience
during
Mr.
Poyser
's
speech
,
but
it
was
too
feeble
to
nullify
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
being
praised
.
<EOS>
Did
he
not
deserve
what
was
said
of
him
on
the
whole
?
<EOS>
If
there
was
something
in
his
conduct
that
Poyser
would
n't
have
liked
if
he
had
known
it
,
why
,
no
man
's
conduct
will
bear
too
close
an
inspection
;
and
Poyser
was
not
likely
to
know
it
;
and
,
after
all
,
what
had
he
done
?
<EOS>
Gone
a
little
too
far
,
perhaps
,
in
flirtation
,
but
another
man
in
his
place
would
have
acted
much
worse
;
and
no
harm
would
come
 
<EOS>
no
harm
should
come
,
for
the
next
time
he
was
alone
with
Hetty
,
he
would
explain
to
her
that
she
must
not
think
seriously
of
him
or
of
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
Arthur
<EOS>
,
you
perceive
,
to
be
satisfied
with
himself
.
<EOS>
Uncomfortable
thoughts
must
be
got
rid
of
by
good
intentions
for
the
future
,
which
can
be
formed
so
rapidly
that
he
had
time
to
be
uncomfortable
and
to
become
easy
again
before
Mr.
Poyser
's
slow
speech
was
finished
,
and
when
it
was
time
for
him
to
speak
<EOS>
he
was
quite
light
-
hearted
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
all
,
my
good
friends
and
neighbours
,
"
Arthur
said
,
"
for
the
good
opinion
of
me
,
and
the
kind
feelings
towards
me
which
Mr.
Poyser
has
been
expressing
on
your
behalf
and
on
his
own
,
and
it
will
always
be
my
heartiest
wish
to
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
things
we
may
expect
that
,
if
I
live
,
I
shall
one
day
or
other
be
your
landlord
;
indeed
,
it
is
on
the
ground
of
that
expectation
that
my
grandfather
has
wished
me
to
celebrate
this
day
and
to
come
among
you
now
;
and
I
look
forward
to
this
position
,
not
merely
as
one
of
power
and
pleasure
for
myself
,
but
as
a
means
of
benefiting
my
neighbours
.
<EOS>
It
hardly
becomes
so
young
a
man
as
I
am
to
talk
much
about
farming
to
you
,
who
are
most
of
you
so
much
older
,
and
are
men
of
experience
;
still
,
I
have
interested
myself
a
good
deal
in
such
matters
,
and
learned
as
much
about
them
as
my
opportunities
have
allowed
;
and
when
the
course
of
events
shall
place
the
estate
in
my
hands
,
it
will
be
my
first
desire
to
afford
my
tenants
all
the
encouragement
a
landlord
can
give
them
,
in
improving
their
land
and
trying
to
bring
about
a
better
practice
of
husbandry
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
my
wish
to
be
looked
on
by
all
my
deserving
tenants
as
their
best
friend
,
and
nothing
would
make
me
so
happy
as
to
be
able
to
respect
every
man
on
the
estate
,
and
to
be
respected
by
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
my
place
at
present
to
enter
into
particulars
;
I
only
meet
your
good
hopes
concerning
me
by
telling
you
that
my
own
hopes
correspond
to
them
 
that
what
you
expect
from
me
I
desire
to
fulfil
;
and
I
am
quite
of
Mr.
Poyser
's
opinion
,
that
when
a
man
has
said
what
he
means
,
he
had
better
stop
.
<EOS>
But
the
pleasure
I
feel
in
having
my
own
health
drunk
by
you
would
not
be
perfect
if
we
did
not
drink
the
health
of
my
grandfather
,
who
has
filled
the
place
of
both
parents
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
,
until
you
have
joined
me
in
drinking
his
health
on
a
day
when
he
has
wished
me
to
appear
among
you
as
the
future
representative
of
his
name
and
family
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Perhaps
there
was
no
one
present
except
Mr.
Irwine
who
thoroughly
understood
and
approved
Arthur
's
graceful
mode
of
proposing
his
grandfather
's
health
.
<EOS>
The
farmers
thought
the
young
squire
knew
well
enough
that
they
hated
the
old
squire
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
said
,
"
he
'd
better
not
ha
'
stirred
a
kettle
o
'
sour
broth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
bucolic
mind
does
not
readily
apprehend
the
refinements
of
good
taste
.
<EOS>
But
the
toast
could
not
be
rejected
and
when
it
had
been
drunk
,
Arthur
said
,
"
I
thank
you
,
both
for
my
grandfather
and
myself
;
and
now
there
is
one
more
thing
I
wish
to
tell
you
,
that
you
may
share
my
pleasure
about
it
,
as
I
hope
and
believe
you
will
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
can
be
no
man
here
who
has
not
a
respect
,
and
some
of
you
,
I
am
sure
,
have
a
very
high
regard
,
for
my
friend
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
known
to
every
one
in
this
neighbourhood
that
there
is
no
man
whose
word
can
be
more
depended
on
than
his
;
that
whatever
he
undertakes
to
do
,
he
does
well
,
and
is
as
careful
for
the
interests
of
those
who
employ
him
as
for
his
own
.
<EOS>
I
'm
proud
to
say
that
I
was
very
fond
of
Adam
when
I
was
a
little
boy
,
and
I
have
never
lost
my
old
feeling
for
him
 
<EOS>
I
think
that
shows
that
I
know
a
good
fellow
when
I
find
him
.
<EOS>
It
has
long
been
my
wish
that
he
should
have
the
management
of
the
woods
on
the
estate
,
which
happen
to
be
very
valuable
,
not
only
because
I
think
so
highly
of
his
character
,
but
because
he
has
the
knowledge
and
the
skill
which
fit
him
for
the
place
.
<EOS>
And
I
am
happy
to
tell
you
that
it
is
my
grandfather
's
wish
too
,
and
it
is
now
settled
that
Adam
shall
manage
the
woods
 
a
change
which
I
am
sure
will
be
very
much
for
the
advantage
of
the
estate
;
and
I
hope
you
will
by
and
by
join
me
in
drinking
his
health
,
and
in
wishing
him
all
the
prosperity
in
life
that
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
But
there
is
a
still
older
friend
of
mine
than
Adam
Bede
present
,
and
I
need
not
tell
you
that
it
is
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
will
agree
with
me
that
we
must
drink
no
other
person
's
health
until
we
have
drunk
his
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
have
all
reason
to
love
him
,
but
no
one
of
his
parishioners
has
so
much
reason
as
I.
Come
,
charge
your
glasses
,
and
let
us
drink
to
our
excellent
rector
 
three
times
three
!
"
  
<EOS>
This
toast
was
drunk
with
all
the
enthusiasm
that
was
wanting
to
the
last
,
and
it
certainly
was
the
most
picturesque
moment
in
the
scene
when
Mr.
Irwine
got
up
to
speak
,
and
all
the
faces
in
the
room
were
turned
towards
him
.
<EOS>
The
superior
refinement
of
his
face
was
much
more
striking
than
that
of
Arthur
's
when
seen
in
comparison
with
the
people
round
them
.
<EOS>
Arthur
's
was
a
much
commoner
British
face
,
and
the
splendour
of
his
new
-
fashioned
clothes
was
more
akin
to
the
young
farmer
's
taste
in
costume
than
Mr.
Irwine
's
powder
and
the
well
-
brushed
but
well
-
worn
black
,
which
seemed
to
be
his
chosen
suit
for
great
occasions
;
for
he
had
the
mysterious
secret
of
never
wearing
a
new
-
looking
coat
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
the
first
time
,
by
a
great
many
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
have
had
to
thank
my
parishioners
for
giving
me
tokens
of
their
goodwill
,
but
neighbourly
kindness
is
among
those
things
that
are
the
more
precious
the
older
they
get
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
our
pleasant
meeting
to
-
day
is
a
proof
that
when
what
is
good
comes
of
age
and
is
likely
to
live
,
there
is
reason
for
rejoicing
,
and
the
relation
between
us
as
clergyman
and
parishioners
came
of
age
two
years
ago
,
for
it
is
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
since
I
first
came
among
you
,
and
I
see
some
tall
fine
-
looking
young
men
here
,
as
well
as
some
blooming
young
women
,
that
were
far
from
looking
as
pleasantly
at
me
when
I
christened
them
as
I
am
happy
to
see
them
looking
now
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
sure
you
will
not
wonder
when
I
say
that
among
all
those
young
men
,
the
one
in
whom
I
have
the
strongest
interest
is
my
friend
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
for
whom
you
have
just
expressed
your
regard
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
pleasure
of
being
his
tutor
for
several
years
,
and
have
naturally
had
opportunities
of
knowing
him
intimately
which
can
not
have
occurred
to
any
one
else
who
is
present
;
and
I
have
some
pride
as
well
as
pleasure
in
assuring
you
that
I
share
your
high
hopes
concerning
him
,
and
your
confidence
in
his
possession
of
those
qualities
which
will
make
him
an
excellent
landlord
when
the
time
shall
come
for
him
to
take
that
important
position
among
you
.
<EOS>
We
feel
alike
on
most
matters
on
which
a
man
who
is
getting
towards
fifty
can
feel
in
common
with
a
young
man
of
one
-
and
-
twenty
,
and
he
has
just
been
expressing
a
feeling
which
I
share
very
heartily
,
and
I
would
not
willingly
omit
the
opportunity
of
saying
so
.
<EOS>
That
feeling
is
his
value
and
respect
for
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
People
in
a
high
station
are
of
course
more
thought
of
and
talked
about
and
have
their
virtues
more
praised
,
than
those
whose
lives
are
passed
in
humble
everyday
work
;
but
every
sensible
man
knows
how
necessary
that
humble
everyday
work
is
,
and
how
important
it
is
to
us
that
it
should
be
done
well
.
<EOS>
And
I
agree
with
my
friend
Mr.
Arthur
Donnithorne
in
feeling
that
when
a
man
whose
duty
lies
in
that
sort
of
work
shows
a
character
which
would
make
him
an
example
in
any
station
,
his
merit
should
be
acknowledged
.
<EOS>
He
is
one
of
those
to
whom
honour
is
due
,
and
his
friends
should
delight
to
honour
him
.
<EOS>
I
know
Adam
Bede
<EOS>
well
 
<EOS>
I
know
what
he
is
as
a
workman
,
and
what
he
has
been
as
a
son
and
brother
 
<EOS>
and
I
am
saying
the
simplest
truth
when
I
say
that
I
respect
him
as
much
as
I
respect
any
man
living
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
not
speaking
to
you
about
a
stranger
;
some
of
you
are
his
intimate
friends
,
and
I
believe
there
is
not
one
here
who
does
not
know
enough
of
him
to
join
heartily
in
drinking
his
health
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Irwine
paused
,
Arthur
jumped
up
and
,
filling
his
glass
,
said
,
"
A
bumper
to
Adam
Bede
,
and
may
he
live
to
have
sons
as
faithful
and
clever
as
himself
!
"
  
<EOS>
No
hearer
,
not
even
Bartle
Massey
,
was
so
delighted
with
this
toast
as
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tough
work
"
<EOS>
as
his
first
speech
had
been
,
he
would
have
started
up
to
make
another
if
he
had
not
known
the
extreme
irregularity
of
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
found
an
outlet
for
his
feeling
in
drinking
his
ale
unusually
fast
,
and
setting
down
his
glass
with
a
swing
of
his
arm
and
a
determined
rap
.
<EOS>
If
Jonathan
Burge
and
a
few
others
felt
less
comfortable
on
the
occasion
,
they
tried
their
best
to
look
contented
,
and
so
the
toast
was
drunk
with
a
goodwill
apparently
unanimous
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
rather
paler
than
usual
when
he
got
up
to
thank
his
friends
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
deal
moved
by
this
public
tribute
 
very
naturally
,
for
he
was
in
the
presence
of
all
his
little
world
,
and
it
was
uniting
to
do
him
honour
.
<EOS>
But
he
felt
no
shyness
about
speaking
,
not
being
troubled
with
small
vanity
or
lack
of
words
;
he
looked
neither
awkward
nor
embarrassed
,
but
stood
in
his
usual
firm
upright
attitude
,
with
his
head
thrown
a
little
backward
and
his
hands
perfectly
still
,
in
that
rough
dignity
which
is
peculiar
to
intelligent
,
honest
,
well
-
built
workmen
,
who
are
never
wondering
what
is
their
business
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
quite
taken
by
surprise
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
expect
anything
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
this
sort
,
for
it
's
a
good
deal
more
than
my
wages
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
the
more
reason
to
be
grateful
to
you
,
Captain
,
and
to
you
,
Mr.
Irwine
,
and
to
all
my
friends
here
,
who
've
drunk
my
health
and
wished
me
well
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
be
nonsense
for
me
to
be
saying
,
I
do
n't
at
all
deserve
th
'
opinion
you
have
of
me
;
that
'
ud
be
poor
thanks
to
you
,
to
say
that
you
've
known
me
all
these
years
and
yet
have
n't
sense
enough
to
find
out
a
great
deal
o
'
the
truth
about
me
.
<EOS>
You
think
,
if
I
undertake
to
do
a
bit
o
'
work
,
I
'll
do
it
well
<EOS>
,
be
my
pay
big
or
little
 
and
that
's
true
.
<EOS>
I
'd
be
ashamed
to
stand
before
you
here
if
it
wasna
true
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
to
me
that
's
a
man
's
plain
duty
,
and
nothing
to
be
conceited
about
,
and
it
's
pretty
clear
to
me
as
I
've
never
done
more
than
my
duty
;
for
let
us
do
what
we
will
,
it
's
only
making
use
o
'
the
sperrit
and
the
powers
that
ha
'
been
given
to
us
.
<EOS>
And
so
this
kindness
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
yours
,
I
'm
sure
,
is
no
debt
you
owe
me
,
but
a
free
gift
,
and
as
such
I
accept
it
and
am
thankful
.
<EOS>
And
as
to
this
new
employment
I
've
taken
in
hand
,
I
'll
only
say
that
I
took
it
at
Captain
Donnithorne
's
desire
,
and
that
I
'll
try
to
fulfil
his
expectations
.
<EOS>
I
'd
wish
for
no
better
lot
than
to
work
under
him
,
and
to
know
that
while
I
was
getting
my
own
bread
I
was
taking
care
of
his
int'rests
.
<EOS>
For
I
believe
he
's
one
<EOS>
o
those
gentlemen
as
wishes
to
do
the
right
thing
,
and
to
leave
the
world
a
bit
better
than
he
found
it
,
which
it
's
my
belief
every
man
may
do
,
whether
he
's
gentle
or
simple

whether
he
sets
a
good
bit
o

work
going
and
finds
the
money
,
or
whether
he
does
the
work
with
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
occasion
for
me
to
say
any
more
about
what
I
feel
towards
him
:
I
hope
to
show
it
through
the
rest

my
life
in
my

There
were
various
opinions
about
Adam
's
speech
:
some
of
the
women
whispered
that
he
did
n't
show
himself
thankful
enough
,
and
seemed
to
speak
as
proud
as
could
be
;
but
most
of
the
men
were
of
opinion
that
nobody
could
speak
more
straightfor'ard
,
and
that
Adam
was
as
fine
a
chap
as
need
to
be
.
<EOS>
While
such
observations
were
being
buzzed
about
,
mingled
with
wonderings
as
to
what
the
old
squire
meant
to
do
for
a
bailiff
,
and
whether
he
was
going
to
have
a
steward
,
the
two
gentlemen
had
risen
,
and
were
walking
round
to
the
table
where
the
wives
and
children
sat
.
<EOS>
There
was
none
of
the
strong
ale
here
,
of
course
,
but
wine
and
dessert
 
sparkling
gooseberry
for
the
young
ones
,
and
some
good
sherry
for
the
mothers
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
was
at
the
head
of
this
table
,
and
Totty
was
now
seated
in
her
lap
,
bending
her
small
nose
deep
down
into
a
wine
-
glass
in
search
of
the
nuts
floating
there
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
do
,
Mrs.
Poyser
?
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
Were
n't
you
pleased
to
hear
your
husband
make
such
a
good
speech
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
the
men
are
mostly
so
tongue
-
tied
 
<EOS>
you
're
forced
partly
to
guess
what
they
mean
,
<EOS>
as
you
do
wi
'
the
dumb
creaturs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
you
think
you
could
have
made
it
better
for
him
?
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
when
I
want
to
say
anything
,
I
can
mostly
find
words
to
say
it
in
,
thank
God
.
<EOS>
Not
as
I
'm
a

finding
faut
wi
'
my
husband
,
for
if
he
's
a
man
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
few
words
,
what
he
says
he
'll
stand
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
never
saw
a
prettier
party
than
this
,
"
Arthur
said
,
looking
round
at
the
apple
-
cheeked
children
.
<EOS>
"
My
aunt
and
the
Miss
Irwines
will
come
up
and
see
you
presently
.
<EOS>
They
were
afraid
of
the
noise
of
the
toasts
,
but
it
would
be
a
shame
for
them
not
to
see
you
at
table
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
on
,
speaking
to
the
mothers
and
patting
the
children
,
while
Mr.
Irwine
satisfied
himself
with
standing
still
and
nodding
at
a
distance
,
that
no
one
's
attention
might
be
disturbed
from
the
young
squire
,
the
hero
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Arthur
did
not
venture
to
stop
near
Hetty
,
but
merely
bowed
to
her
as
he
passed
along
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
The
foolish
child
felt
her
heart
swelling
with
discontent
;
for
what
woman
was
ever
satisfied
with
apparent
neglect
,
even
when
she
knows
it
to
be
the
mask
of
love
?
<EOS>
Hetty
thought
this
was
going
to
be
the
most
miserable
day
she
had
had
for
a
long
while
<EOS>
,
a
moment
of
chill
daylight
and
reality
came
across
her
dream
:
<EOS>
Arthur
,
who
had
seemed
so
near
to
her
only
a
few
hours
before
,
was
separated
from
her
,
as
the
hero
of
a
great
procession
is
separated
from
a
small
outsider
in
the
crowd
.
    
<EOS>
The
Games
  
<EOS>
THE
great
dance
was
not
to
begin
until
eight
o'clock
,
but
for
any
lads
and
lasses
who
liked
to
dance
on
the
shady
grass
before
then
,
there
was
music
always
at
hand
 
for
was
not
the
band
of
the
Benefit
Club
capable
of
playing
excellent
jigs
,
reels
,
and
hornpipes
?
<EOS>
And
,
besides
this
,
there
was
a
grand
band
hired
from
Rosseter
,
who
,
with
their
wonderful
wind
-
instruments
and
puffed
-
out
cheeks
,
were
themselves
a
delightful
show
to
the
small
boys
and
girls
.
<EOS>
To
say
nothing
of
Joshua
Rann
's
fiddle
,
which
,
by
an
act
of
generous
forethought
,
he
had
provided
himself
with
,
in
case
any
one
should
be
of
sufficiently
pure
taste
to
prefer
dancing
to
a
solo
on
that
instrument
.
  
<EOS>
Meantime
,
when
the
sun
had
moved
off
the
great
open
space
in
front
of
the
house
,
the
games
began
.
<EOS>
There
were
,
of
course
,
well
-
soaped
poles
to
be
climbed
by
the
boys
and
youths
,
races
to
be
run
by
the
old
women
,
races
to
be
run
in
sacks
,
heavy
weights
to
be
lifted
by
the
strong
men
,
and
a
long
list
of
challenges
to
such
ambitious
attempts
as
that
of
walking
as
many
yards
possible
on
one
leg
 
feats
in
which
it
was
generally
remarked
that
Wiry
Ben
,
being
"
the
lissom'st
,
<EOS>
springest
fellow
<EOS>
i
'
the
country
,
"
was
sure
to
be
pre
-
eminent
.
<EOS>
To
crown
all
,
there
was
to
be
a
donkey
-
race
 
<EOS>
that
sublimest
of
all
races
,
conducted
on
the
grand
socialistic
idea
of
everybody
encouraging
everybody
else
's
donkey
,
and
the
sorriest
donkey
winning
.
  
<EOS>
And
soon
after
four
o'clock
,
splendid
old
Mrs.
Irwine
,
in
her
damask
satin
and
jewels
and
black
lace
,
was
led
out
by
Arthur
,
followed
by
the
whole
family
party
,
to
her
raised
seat
under
the
striped
marquee
,
where
she
was
to
give
out
the
prizes
to
the
victors
.
<EOS>
Staid
,
formal
Miss
Lydia
had
requested
to
resign
that
queenly
office
to
the
royal
old
lady
,
and
Arthur
was
pleased
with
this
opportunity
of
gratifying
his
godmother
's
taste
for
stateliness
.
<EOS>
Old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
the
delicately
clean
,
finely
scented
,
withered
old
man
,
led
out
Miss
Irwine
,
with
his
air
of
punctilious
,
acid
politeness
;
Mr.
Gawaine
brought
Miss
Lydia
,
looking
neutral
and
stiff
in
an
elegant
peach
-
blossom
silk
;
and
Mr.
Irwine
came
last
with
his
pale
sister
Anne
.
<EOS>
No
other
friend
of
the
family
,
besides
Mr.
Gawaine
,
was
invited
to
-
day
;
there
was
to
be
a
grand
dinner
for
the
neighbouring
gentry
on
the
morrow
,
but
to
-
day
all
the
forces
were
required
for
the
entertainment
of
the
tenants
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
sunk
fence
in
front
of
the
marquee
,
dividing
the
lawn
from
the
park
,
but
a
temporary
bridge
had
been
made
for
the
passage
of
the
victors
,
and
the
groups
of
people
standing
,
or
seated
here
and
there
on
benches
,
stretched
on
each
side
of
the
open
space
from
the
white
marquees
up
to
the
sunk
fence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
word
it
's
a
pretty
sight
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
in
her
deep
voice
,
when
she
was
seated
,
and
looked
round
on
the
bright
scene
with
its
dark
-
green
background
;
"
and
it
's
the
last
fete
-
day
I
'm
likely
to
see
,
unless
you
make
haste
and
get
married
,
Arthur
.
<EOS>
But
take
care
you
get
a
charming
bride
,
else
I
would
rather
die
without
seeing
her

"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
so
terribly
fastidious
,
Godmother

"
said
Arthur
,
"
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
I
should
never
satisfy
you
with
my
choice

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
wo
n't
forgive
you
if
she
's
not
handsome
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
put
off
with
amiability
,
which
is
always
the
excuse
people
are
making
for
the
existence
of
plain
people
.
<EOS>
And
she
must
not
be
silly
;
that
will
never
do
,
because
you
'll
want
managing
,
and
a
silly
woman
ca
n't
manage
you

<EOS>
Who
is
that
tall
young
man
,
Dauphin
,
with
the
mild
face
?
<EOS>
There
,
standing
without
his
hat
,
and
taking
such
care
of
that
tall
old
woman
by
the
side
of
him
 
his
mother
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
I
like
to
see
that

<EOS>
"
What
,
do
n't
you
know
him
,
Mother

"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
That
is
Seth
Bede
,
Adam
's
brother
 
a
Methodist
,
but
a
very
good
fellow
.
<EOS>
Poor
Seth
has
looked
rather
down
-
hearted
of
late
;
I
thought
it
was
because
of
his
father
's
dying
in
that
sad
way
,
but
Joshua
Rann
tells
me
he
wanted
to
marry
that
sweet
little
Methodist
preacher
who
was
here
about
a
month
ago
,
and
I
suppose
she
refused
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
I
remember
hearing
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
no
end
of
people
here
that
I
do
n't
know
,
for
they
're
grown
up
and
altered
so
since
I
used
to
go
about
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
excellent
sight
you
have
!
"
said
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
who
was
holding
a
double
glass
up
to
his
eyes
,
"
to
see
the
expression
of
that
young
man
's
face
so
far
off
.
<EOS>
His
face
is
nothing
but
a
pale
blurred
spot
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
have
the
advantage
of
you
when
we
come
to
look
close

<EOS>
I
can
read
small
print
without
spectacles

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
my
dear
sir
,
you
began
with
being
very
near

sighted
,
and
those
near
-
sighted
eyes
always
wear
the
best

<EOS>
I
want
very
strong
spectacles
to
read
with
,
but
then
I
think
my
eyes
get
better
and
better
for
things
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
if
I
could
live
another
fifty
years
,
I
should
be
blind
to
everything
that
was
n't
out
of
other
people

sight

like
a
man

stands
in

sees
nothing

"
See

said
Arthur

giving

Martin

a

very
respectably

Why

six

Miss

"
No

I

never

child

said
Mrs.

continuing
to
look
at
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
-
looking

<EOS>
She
's
a
perfect

<EOS>
I
've
never

anything
so
pretty

my
young
days

<EOS>
What
a
pity
such
beauty
as
that
should
be
thrown
away
among
the
farmers
,
when
it
's
wanted
so
terribly
among
the
good
families
without
fortune
!
<EOS>
I
daresay
,
now
,
she
'll
marry
a
man
who
would
have
thought
her
just
as
pretty
if
she
had
had
round
eyes
and
red
hair
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
dared
not
turn
his
eyes
towards
Hetty
while
Mrs.
Irwine
was
speaking
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
feigned
not
to
hear
,
and
to
be
occupied
with
something
on
the
opposite
side
.
<EOS>
But
he
saw
her
plainly
enough
without
looking
;
saw
her
in
heightened
beauty
,
because
he
heard
her
beauty
praised
 
for
other
men
's
opinion
,
you
know
,
was
like
a
native
climate
to
Arthur
's
feelings
:
it
was
the
air
on
which
they
thrived
the
best
,
and
grew
strong
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
She
was
enough
to
turn
any
man
's
head
:
any
man
in
his
place
would
have
done
and
felt
the
same
.
<EOS>
And
to
give
her
up
after
all
,
as
he
was
determined
to
do
,
would
be
an
act
that
he
should
always
look
back
upon
with
pride
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mother
,
"
and
Mr.
Irwine
,
replying
to
her
last
words
;
"
I
ca
n't
agree
with
you
there
.
<EOS>
The
common
people
are
not
quite
so
stupid
as
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
The
commonest
man
,
who
has
his
ounce
of
sense
and
feeling
,
is
conscious
of
the
difference
between
a
lovely
,
delicate
woman
and
a
coarse
one
.
<EOS>
Even
a
dog
feels
a
difference
in
their
presence
.
<EOS>
The
man
may
be
no
better
able
than
the
dog
to
explain
the
influence
the
more
refined
beauty
has
on
him
,
but
he
feels
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Bless
me
,
Dauphin
,
what
does
an
old
bachelor
like
you
know
about
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
is
one
of
the
matters
in
which
old
bachelors
are
wiser
than
married
men
,
because
they
have
time
for
more
general
contemplation
.
<EOS>
Your
fine
critic
of
woman
must
never
shackle
his
judgment
by
calling
one
woman
his
own
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
an
example
of
what
I
was
saying
,
that
pretty
Methodist
preacher
<EOS>
I
mentioned
just
now
told
me
that
she
had
preached
to
the
roughest
miners
and
had
never
been
treated
with
anything
but
the
utmost
respect
and
kindness
by
them
.
<EOS>
The
reason
is
 
though
she
does
n't
know
it
 
<EOS>
that
there
's
so
much
tenderness
,
refinement
,
and
purity
about
her
.
<EOS>
Such
a
woman
as
that
brings
with
her
"
airs
from
heaven
"
that
the
coarsest
fellow
is
not
insensible
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
delicate
bit
of
womanhood
,
or
girlhood
,
coming
to
receive
a
prize
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
Mr.
Gawaine
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
one
of
the
racers
in
the
sacks
,
who
had
set
off
before
we
came
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
"
bit
of
womanhood
"
was
our
old
acquaintance
Bessy
Cranage
,
otherwise
Chad
's
Bess
,
whose
large
red
cheeks
and
blowsy
person
had
undergone
an
exaggeration
of
colour
,
which
,
if
she
had
happened
to
be
a
heavenly
body
,
would
have
made
her
sublime
.
<EOS>
Bessy
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
had
taken
to
her
ear
-
rings
again
since
Dinah
's
departure
,
and
was
otherwise
decked
out
in
such
small
finery
as
she
could
muster
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
could
have
looked
into
poor
Bessy
's
heart
would
have
seen
a
striking
resemblance
between
her
little
hopes
and
anxieties
and
Hetty
's
.
<EOS>
The
advantage
,
perhaps
,
would
have
been
on
Bessy
's
side
in
the
matter
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
you
see
,
they
were
so
very
different
outside
!
<EOS>
You
would
have
been
inclined
to
box
Bessy
's
ears
,
and
you
would
have
longed
to
kiss
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
Bessy
had
been
tempted
to
run
the
arduous
race
,
partly
from
mere
hedonish
gaiety
,
partly
because
of
the
prize
.
<EOS>
Some
one
had
said
there
were
to
be
cloaks
and
other
nice
clothes
for
prizes
,
and
she
approached
the
marquee
,
fanning
herself
with
her
handkerchief
,
but
with
exultation
sparkling
in
her
round
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
the
prize
for
the
first
sack
-
race
,
"
said
Miss
Lydia
,
taking
a
large
parcel
from
the
table
where
the
prizes
were
laid
and
giving
it
to
Mrs.
Irwine
before
Bessy
came
up
,
"
an
excellent
grogram
gown
and
a
piece
of
flannel
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
did
n't
think
the
winner
was
to
be
so
young
,
I
suppose
,
Aunt
?
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
Could
n't
you
find
something
else
for
this
girl
,
and
save
that
grim
-
looking
gown
for
one
of
the
older
women
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
bought
nothing
but
what
is
useful
and
substantial
,
"
said
Miss
Lydia
,
adjusting
her
own
lace
;
"
I
should
not
think
of
encouraging
a
love
of
finery
in
young
women
of
that
class
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
scarlet
cloak
,
but
that
is
for
the
old
woman
who
wins
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
speech
of
Miss
Lydia
's
produced
rather
a
mocking
expression
in
Mrs.
Irwine
's
face
as
she
looked
at
Arthur
,
while
Bessy
came
up
and
dropped
a
series
of
curtsies
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
Bessy
Cranage
,
mother
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
kindly
,
"
Chad
Cranage
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
You
remember
Chad
Cranage
,
the
blacksmith
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Bessy
,
here
is
your
prize
 
excellent
warm
things
for
winter
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
you
have
had
hard
work
to
win
them
this
warm
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
Bessy
's
lip
fell
as
she
saw
the
ugly
,
heavy
gown
 
which
felt
so
hot
and
disagreeable
too
,
on
this
July
day
,
and
was
such
a
great
ugly
thing
to
carry
.
<EOS>
She
dropped
her
curtsies
again
,
without
looking
up
,
and
with
a
growing
tremulousness
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
,
and
then
turned
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
girl
,
"
said
Arthur
;
"
I
think
she
's
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
wish
it
had
been
something
more
to
her
taste
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
a
bold
-
looking
young
person
,
"
observed
Miss
Lydia
.
<EOS>
"
Not
at
all
one
I
should
like
to
encourage
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
silently
resolved
that
he
would
make
Bessy
a
present
of
money
before
the
day
was
over
,
that
she
might
buy
something
more
to
her
mind
;
but
she
,
not
aware
of
the
consolation
in
store
for
her
,
turned
out
of
the
open
space
,
where
she
was
visible
from
the
marquee
,
and
throwing
down
the
odious
bundle
under
a
tree
,
began
to
cry
 
very
much
tittered
at
the
while
by
the
small
boys
.
<EOS>
In
this
situation
she
was
descried
by
her
discreet
matronly
cousin
,
who
lost
no
time
in
coming
up
,
having
just
given
the
baby
into
her
husband
's
charge
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
wi
'
ye
?
"
said
Bess
the
matron
,
taking
up
the
bundle
and
examining
it
.
"
<EOS>
Ye'n
sweltered
yoursen
,
I
reckon
,
running
that
fool
's
race
.
<EOS>
An

o
<EOS>
'
good
grogram
and
flannel
,
as
should
ha

been
gi'en
by
good
rights
to
them
as
had
the
sense
to
keep
away
from
such
foolery
.
<EOS>
Ye
might
spare
me
<EOS>
a
bit
o
'
this
grogram
to
make
clothes
for
the
lad
 
ye
war
ne'er
<EOS>
ill
-
natured
,
Bess
<EOS>
;
I
ne'er
said
that
on
ye
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye
may
take
it
all
,
for
what
I
care
,
"
said
Bess
the
maiden
,
with
a
pettish
movement
,
beginning
to
wipe
away
her
tears
and
recover
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
could
do
wi't
,
if
so
be
ye
want
to
get
rid
on't
,
"
said
the
disinterested
cousin
,
walking
quickly
away
with
the
bundle
,
lest
Chad
's
Bess
should
change
her
mind
.
  
<EOS>
But
that
bonny
-
cheeked
lass
was
blessed
with
an
elasticity
of
spirits
that
secured
her
from
any
rankling
grief
;
and
by
the
time
the
grand
climax
of
the
donkey
-
race
came
on
<EOS>
,
her
disappointment
was
entirely
lost
in
the
delightful
excitement
of
attempting
to
stimulate
the
last
donkey
by
hisses
,
while
the
boys
applied
the
argument
of
sticks
.
<EOS>
But
the
strength
of
the
donkey
mind
lies
in
adopting
a
course
inversely
as
the
arguments
urged
,
which
,
well
considered
,
requires
as
great
a
mental
force
as
the
direct
sequence
;
and
the
present
donkey
proved
the
first
-
rate
order
of
his
intelligence
by
coming
to
a
dead
standstill
just
when
the
blows
were
thickest
.
<EOS>
Great
was
the
shouting
of
the
crowd
,
radiant
the
grinning
of
Bill
Downes
the
stone
-
sawyer
and
the
fortunate
rider
of
this
superior
beast
,
which
stood
calm
and
stiff
-
legged
in
the
midst
of
its
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
himself
had
provided
the
prizes
for
the
men
,
and
Bill
was
made
happy
with
a
splendid
pocket
-
knife
,
supplied
with
blades
and
gimlets
enough
to
make
a
man
at
home
on
a
desert
island
.
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
returned
from
the
marquee
with
the
prize
in
his
hand
,
when
it
began
to
be
understood
that
Wiry
Ben
proposed
to
amuse
the
company
,
before
the
gentry
went
to
dinner
,
with
an
impromptu
and
gratuitous
performance
 
namely
,
a
hornpipe
,
the
main
idea
of
which
was
doubtless
borrowed
;
but
this
was
to
be
developed
by
the
dancer
in
so
peculiar
and
complex
a
manner
that
no
one
could
deny
him
the
praise
of
originality
.
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
's
pride
in
his
dancing
 
an
accomplishment
productive
of
great
effect
at
the
yearly
Wake
 
had
needed
only
slightly
elevating
by
an
extra
quantity
of
good
ale
to
convince
him
that
the
gentry
would
be
very
much
struck
with
his
performance
of
his
hornpipe
;
and
he
had
been
decidedly
encouraged
in
this
idea
by
Joshua
Rann
,
who
observed
that
it
was
nothing
but
right
to
do
something
to
please
the
young
squire
,
in
return
for
what
he
had
done
for
them
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
the
less
surprised
at
this
opinion
in
so
grave
a
personage
when
you
learn
that
Ben
had
requested
Mr.
Rann
to
accompany
him
on
the
fiddle
,
and
Joshua
felt
quite
sure
that
though
there
might
not
be
much
in
the
dancing
,
the
music
would
make
up
for
it
.
<EOS>
Adam
Bede
,
who
was
present
in
one
of
the
large
marquees
,
where
the
plan
was
being
discussed
,
told
Ben
he
had
better
not
make
a
fool
of
himself
 
a
remark
which
at
once
fixed
Ben
's
determination
:
he
was
not
going
to
let
anything
alone
because
Adam
Bede
turned
up
his
nose
at
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
this
,
what
's
this
?
"
said
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
something
you
've
arranged
,
Arthur
?
<EOS>
Here
's
the
clerk
coming
with
his
fiddle
,
and
a
smart
fellow
with
a
nosegay
in
his
button
-
hole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Arthur
;
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
<EOS>
By
Jove
,
he
's
going
to
dance
!
<EOS>
It
's
one
of
the
carpenters
 
<EOS>
I
forget
his
name
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Ben
Cranage
 
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
,
they
call
him
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
;
"
rather
a
loose
fish
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Anne
,
my
dear
,
I
see
that
fiddle
-
scraping
is
too
much
for
you
:
you
're
getting
tired
.
<EOS>
Let
me
take
you
in
now
,
that
you
may
rest
till
dinner
.
"
  
<EOS>
Miss
Anne
rose
assentingly
,
and
the
good
brother
took
her
away
,
while
Joshua
's
preliminary
scrapings
burst
into
the
"
White
Cockade
,
"
from
which
he
intended
to
pass
to
a
variety
of
tunes
,
by
a
series
of
transitions
which
his
good
ear
really
taught
him
to
execute
with
some
skill
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
an
exasperating
fact
to
him
,
if
he
had
known
it
,
that
the
general
attention
was
too
thoroughly
absorbed
by
Ben
's
dancing
for
any
one
to
give
much
heed
to
the
music
.
  
<EOS>
Have
you
ever
seen
a
real
English
rustic
perform
a
solo
dance
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
have
only
seen
a
ballet
rustic
,
smiling
like
a
merry
countryman
in
crockery
,
with
graceful
turns
of
the
haunch
and
insinuating
movements
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
That
is
as
much
like
the
real
thing
as
the
"
Bird
Waltz
"
is
like
the
song
of
birds
.
<EOS>
Wiry
Ben
never
smiled
:
he
looked
as
serious
as
a
dancing
monkey
 
as
serious
as
if
he
had
been
an
experimental
philosopher
ascertaining
in
his
own
person
the
amount
of
shaking
and
<EOS>
the
varieties
of
angularity
that
could
be
given
to
the
human
limbs
.
  
<EOS>
To
make
amends
for
the
abundant
laughter
in
the
striped
marquee
,
Arthur
clapped
his
hands
continually
and
cried
"
Bravo
!
"
<EOS>
But
Ben
had
one
admirer
whose
eyes
followed
his
movements
with
a
fervid
gravity
that
equalled
his
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
Martin
Poyser
,
who
was
seated
on
a
bench
,
with
Tommy
between
his
legs
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
dost
think
o
'
that
?
"
he
said
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
He
goes
as
pat
to
the
music
as
if
he
was
made
o
'
clockwork
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
be
a
pretty
good
un
at
dancing
myself
when
I
was
lighter
,
but
I
could
niver
ha
'
hit
it
just
to
th

hair
like
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It

little
matter
what
his
limbs
are

my
thinking

He

empty

"
Well

well

so
much

said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
did
not
easily
take
an
irritable
view
of
things
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
're
going
away
now
<EOS>

Well

He

<EOS>
The
Dance
  
ARTHUR
had
chosen
the
entrance
-
hall
for
the
ballroom
:
very
wisely
,
for
no
other
room
could
have
been
so
airy
,
or
would
have
had
the
advantage
of
the
wide
doors
opening
into
the
garden
,
as
well
as
a
ready
entrance
into
the
other
rooms
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
a
stone
floor
was
not
the
pleasantest
to
dance
on
,
but
then
,
most
of
the
dancers
had
known
what
it
was
to
enjoy
a
Christmas
dance
on
kitchen
quarries
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
those
entrance
-
halls
which
make
the
surrounding
rooms
look
like
closets
 
with
stucco
angels
,
trumpets
,
and
flower
-
wreaths
on
the
lofty
ceiling
,
and
great
medallions
of
miscellaneous
heroes
on
the
walls
,
alternating
with
statues
in
niches
.
<EOS>
Just
the
sort
of
place
to
be
ornamented
well
with
green
boughs
,
and
Mr.
Craig
had
been
proud
to
show
his
taste
and
his
hothouse
plants
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
broad
steps
of
the
stone
staircase
were
covered
with
cushions
to
serve
as
seats
for
the
children
,
who
were
to
stay
till
half
-
past
nine
with
the
servant
-
maids
to
see
the
dancing
,
and
as
this
dance
was
confined
to
the
chief
tenants
,
there
was
abundant
room
for
every
one
.
<EOS>
The
lights
were
charmingly
disposed
in
coloured
-
paper
lamps
,
high
up
among
green
boughs
,
and
the
farmers
'
wives
and
daughters
,
as
they
peeped
in
,
believed
no
scene
could
be
more
splendid
;
they
knew
now
quite
well
in
what
sort
of
rooms
the
king
and
queen
lived
,
and
their
thoughts
glanced
with
some
pity
towards
cousins
and
acquaintances
who
had
not
this
fine
opportunity
of
knowing
how
things
went
on
in
the
great
world
.
<EOS>
The
lamps
were
already
lit
,
though
the
sun
had
not
long
set
,
and
there
was
that
calm
light
out
of
doors
in
which
we
seem
to
see
all
objects
more
distinctly
than
in
the
broad
day
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
scene
outside
the
house
:
the
farmers
and
their
families
were
moving
about
the
lawn
,
among
the
flowers
and
shrubs
,
or
along
the
broad
straight
road
leading
from
the
east
front
,
where
a
carpet
of
mossy
grass
spread
on
each
side
,
studded
here
and
there
with
a
dark
flat
-
boughed
cedar
,
or
a
grand
pyramidal
fir
sweeping
the
ground
with
its
branches
,
all
tipped
with
a
fringe
of
paler
green
.
<EOS>
The
groups
of
cottagers
in
the
park
were
gradually
diminishing
,
the
young
ones
being
attracted
towards
the
lights
that
were
beginning
to
gleam
from
the
windows
of
the
gallery
in
the
abbey
,
which
was
to
be
their
dancing
-
room
,
and
some
of
the
sober
elder
ones
thinking
it
time
to
go
home
quietly
.
<EOS>
One
of
these
was
Lisbeth
Bede
,
and
Seth
went
with
her
 
not
from
filial
attention
only
,
for
his
conscience
would
not
let
him
join
in
dancing
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
rather
a
melancholy
day
to
Seth
:
<EOS>
Dinah
had
never
been
more
constantly
present
with
him
than
in
this
scene
,
where
everything
was
so
unlike
her
.
<EOS>
He
saw
her
all
the
more
vividly
after
looking
at
the
thoughtless
faces
and
gay
-
coloured
dresses
of
the
young
women
 
just
as
one
feels
the
beauty
and
the
greatness
of
a
pictured
Madonna
the
more
when
it
has
been
for
a
moment
screened
from
us
by
a
vulgar
head
in
a
bonnet
.
<EOS>
But
this
presence
of
Dinah
in
his
mind
only
helped
him
to
bear
the
better
with
his
mother
's
mood
,
which
had
been
becoming
more
and
more
querulous
for
the
last
hour
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lisbeth
was
suffering
from
a
strange
conflict
of
feelings
.
<EOS>
Her
joy
and
pride
in
the
honour
paid
to
her
darling
son
Adam
was
beginning
to
be
worsted
in
the
conflict
with
the
jealousy
and
fretfulness
which
had
revived
when
Adam
came
to
tell
her
that
Captain
Donnithorne
desired
him
to
join
the
dancers
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
getting
more
and
more
out
of
her
reach
;
she
wished
all
the
old
troubles
back
again
,
for
then
it
mattered
more
to
Adam
what
his
mother
said
and
did
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
it
's
fine
talkin
'
o
'
dancin
'
,
"
she
said
,
"
an
'
thy
father
not
a
five
week
in
's
grave
.
<EOS>
An
'
I
wish
I

there
too
,
i'stid
o
'
bein
'
left
to
take
up
merrier
folks
's

.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
do
n't
look
at
it
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
that
way
,
Mother
,
"
said
Adam
,
who
was
determined
to
be
gentle
to
her
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
mean
to
dance
 
I
shall
only
look
on
.
<EOS>
And
since
the
captain
wishes
me
to
be
there
,
it
'
ud
look
as
if
I
thought
I
knew
better
than
him
to
say
as
I
'd
rather
not
stay
.
<EOS>
And
thee
know'st
how
he
's
behaved
to
me
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
thee't
do
as
thee
lik'st
,
for
thy
<EOS>
old
mother
's
got
no
right
t
'
hinder
thee
.
<EOS>
She
's
nought
but
th
'
old
husk
,
and
thee'st
slipped
away
from
her
,
like
the
ripe
nut
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Mother
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
'll
go
and
tell
the
captain
as
it
hurts
thy
feelings
for
me
to
stay
,
and
I
'd
rather
go
home
upo
'
<EOS>
that
account
:
he
wo
n't
take
it
ill
then
,
I
daresay
,
and
I
'm
willing
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
this
with
some
effort
,
for
he
really
longed
to
be
near
Hetty
this
evening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
I
wonna
ha
'
thee

that
 
<EOS>
the
young
squire

Seth

<EOS>
I
know
it
's
a

honour
for

to

"
<EOS>
Well

,
Mother
 
<EOS>
good
-
bye
,
lad
 
<EOS>
remember
Gyp
when
you
get
home
,
"
said
Adam
,
turning
away
towards
the
gate
of
the
pleasure
-
grounds
,
where
he
hoped
he
might
be
able
to
join
the
Poysers
,
for
he
had
been
so
occupied
throughout
the
afternoon
that
he
had
had
no
time
to
speak
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
His
eye
soon
detected
a
distant
group
,
which
he
knew
to
be
the
right
one
,
returning
to
the
house
along
the
broad
gravel
road
,
and
he
hastened
on
to
meet
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Adam
,
I
'm
glad
to
get
sight
on
y
'
again
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
was
carrying
Totty
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
going
t
'
have
a
bit
o
'
<EOS>
fun
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
now
your
work
's
all
done

<EOS>
And
here
's
<EOS>
Hetty
has
promised
no

o

partners

an
'
I

just
been
askin
'
her
if
she

agreed
to

you

an

she

no

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
did
n't
think
o
'
dancing
to
-
night
,
"
said
Adam
,
already
tempted
to
change
his
mind
,
as
he
looked
at
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
everybody
's
goin'
to
dance
to
-
night
,
all
but
th
'
old
squire
and
Mrs.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Best
's
been
tellin
'
us
as
Miss
Lyddy
and
Miss
Irwine
'
ull
dance
,
an
'
the
young
squire
'
ull
pick
my
wife
for
his
first
partner
<EOS>
,
t
'
open
the
ball
:
so
she
'll
be
forced
to
dance
,
though
she
's
laid
by
ever
sin
'
<EOS>
the
Christmas
afore
the
little
un
was
born
.
<EOS>
You
canna
for
shame
stand
still
,
Adam
,
an
'
you
a
fine
young
fellow
and
can
dance
as
well
as
anybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
it
'
ud
be
unbecomin
'
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
dancin
's
nonsense
,
but
if
you
stick
at
everything
because
it
's
nonsense
,
you
wonna
go
far
<EOS>
i
'
this
life
.
<EOS>
When
your
broth
's
ready
-
made
for
you
,
you
mun
swallow
the
thickenin
'
,
or
else
let
the
broth
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
if
Hetty
'
ull
dance
with
me
,
"
said
Adam
,
<EOS>
yielding
either
to
Mrs.
Poyser
's
argument
or
to
something
else
,
"
I
'll
dance
<EOS>
whichever
dance
<EOS>
she
's
free
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
no
partner
for
the
fourth
dance
,
"
said
Hetty
;
<EOS>
"
I
'll
dance
that
with
you
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
but
you
mun
dance
the
first
dance
,
Adam
,
<EOS>
else
it
'll
look
partic'ler
.
<EOS>
There
's
plenty
o
'
nice
partners
to
pick
an
'
choose
from
,
an
'
it
's
hard
for
the
gells
when
the
men
stan
'
by
and
do
n't
ask
'
em
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
felt
the
justice
of
Mr.
Poyser
's
observation
:
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
dance
with
no
one
besides
Hetty
;
and
remembering
that
Jonathan
Burge
had
some
reason
to
feel
hurt
to
-
day
,
he
resolved
to
ask
Miss
Mary
to
dance
with
him
the
first
dance
,
if
she
had
no
other
partner
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
big
clock
strikin
'
eight
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
;
"
we
must
make
haste
in
now
,
else
the
squire
and
the
ladies
'
ull
be
in
afore
us
,
an
'
that
wouldna
look
well
.
<EOS>
"
  
When
they
had
entered
the
hall
,
and
the
three
children
under
Molly
's
charge
had
been
seated
on
the
stairs
,
the
folding
-
doors
of
the
drawing
-
room
were
thrown
open
,
and
Arthur
entered
in
his
regimentals
,
leading
Mrs.
Irwine
to
a
carpet
-
covered
dais
ornamented
with
hot
-
house
plants
,
where
she
and
Miss
Anne
were
to
be
seated
with
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
that
they
might
look
on
at
the
dancing
,
like
the
kings
and
queens
in
the
plays
.
<EOS>
Arthur
had
put
on
his
uniform
to
please
the
tenants
,
he
said
,
who
thought
as
much
of
his
militia
dignity
as
if
it
had
been
an
elevation
to
the
premiership
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
the
least
objection
to
gratify
them
in
that
way
:
his
uniform
was
very
advantageous
to
his
figure
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
squire
,
before
sitting
down
,
walked
round
the
hall
to
greet
the
tenants
and
make
polite
speeches
to
the
wives
:
he
was
always
polite
;
but
the
farmers
had
found
out
,
after
long
puzzling
,
that
this
polish
was
one
of
the
signs
of
hardness
.
<EOS>
It
was
observed
that
he
gave
his
most
elaborate
civility
to
Mrs.
Poyser
to
-
night
,
inquiring
particularly
about
her
health
,
recommending
her
to
strengthen
herself
with
cold
water
as
he
did
,
and
avoid
all
drugs
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
curtsied
and
thanked
him
with
great
self
-
command
,
but
when
he
had
passed
on
,
she
whispered
to
her
husband
,
"
I
'll
lay
my
life
<EOS>
he
's
brewin
'
<EOS>
some
nasty
turn
against
us
.
<EOS>
Old
Harry
doesna
wag
his
tail
so
for
nothin'
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
had
no
time
to
answer
,
for
now
Arthur
came
up
and
said
,
"
Mrs.
Poyser
,
I
'm
come
to
request
the
favour
of
your
hand
for
the
first
dance
;
and
,
Mr.
Poyser
,
you
must
let
me
take
you
to
my
aunt
,
for
she
claims
you
as
her
partner
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wife
's
pale
cheek
flushed
with
a
nervous
sense
of
unwonted
honour
as
Arthur
led
her
to
the
top
of
the
room
;
but
Mr.
Poyser
,
to
whom
an
extra
glass
had
restored
his
youthful
confidence
in
his
good
looks
and
good
dancing
,
walked
along
with
them
quite
proudly
,
secretly
flattering
himself
that
Miss
Lydia
had
never
had
a
partner
in
HER
life
who
could
lift
her
off
the
ground
as
he
would
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
balance
the
honours
given
to
the
two
parishes
,
Miss
Irwine
danced
with
Luke
Britton
,
the
largest
Broxton
farmer
,
and
Mr.
Gawaine
led
out
Mrs.
Britton
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
,
after
seating
his
sister
Anne
,
had
gone
to
the
abbey
gallery
,
as
he
had
agreed
with
Arthur
beforehand
,
to
see
how
the
merriment
of
the
cottagers
was
prospering
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
all
the
less
distinguished
couples
had
taken
their
places
:
Hetty
was
led
out
by
the
inevitable
Mr.
Craig
,
and
Mary
Burge
by
Adam
;
and
now
the
music
struck
up
,
and
the
glorious
country
-
dance
,
best
of
all
dances
,
began
.
  
<EOS>
Pity
it
was
not
a
boarded
floor
!
<EOS>
Then
the
rhythmic
stamping
of
the
thick
shoes
would
have
been
better
than
any
drums
.
<EOS>
That
merry
stamping
<EOS>
,
that
gracious
nodding
of
the
head
,
that
waving
bestowal
of
the
hand
 
where
can
we
see
them
now
?
<EOS>
That
simple
dancing
of
well
-
covered
matrons
,
laying
aside
for
an
hour
the
cares
of
house
and
dairy
,
remembering
but
not
affecting
youth
,
not
jealous
but
proud
of
the
young
maidens
by
their
side
 
<EOS>
that
holiday
sprightliness
of
portly
husbands
paying
little
compliments
to
their
wives
,
as
if
their
courting
days
were
come
again
 
<EOS>
those
lads
and
lasses
a
little
confused
and
awkward
with
their
partners
,
having
nothing
to
say
 
it
would
be
a
pleasant
variety
to
see
all
that
sometimes
,
instead
of
low
dresses
and
large
skirts
,
and
scanning
glances
exploring
costumes
,
and
languid
men
in
lacquered
boots
smiling
with
double
meaning
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
thing
to
mar
Martin
Poyser
's
pleasure
in
this
dance
:
<EOS>
it
was
that
he
was
always
in
close
contact
with
Luke
Britton
,
that
slovenly
farmer
.
<EOS>
He
thought
of
throwing
a
little
glazed
coldness
into
his
eye
in
the
crossing
of
hands
;
but
then
,
as
Miss
Irwine
was
opposite
to
him
instead
of
the
offensive
Luke
,
he
might
freeze
the
wrong
person
.
<EOS>
So
he
gave
his
face
up
to
hilarity
,
unchilled
by
moral
judgments
.
  
<EOS>
How
Hetty
's
heart
beat
as
Arthur
approached
her
!
<EOS>
He
had
hardly
looked
at
her
to
-
day
:
now
he
must
take
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Would
he
press
it
?
<EOS>
Would
he
look
at
her
?
<EOS>
She
thought
she
would
cry
if
he
gave
her
no
sign
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
Now
he
was
there
 
<EOS>
he
had
taken
her
hand
 
<EOS>
yes
,
he
was
pressing
it
.
<EOS>
Hetty
turned
pale
as
she
looked
up
at
him
for
an
instant
and
met
his
eyes
,
before
the
dance
carried
him
away
.
<EOS>
That
pale
look
came
upon
Arthur
like
the
beginning
of
a
dull
pain
,
which
clung
to
him
,
though
he
must
dance
and
smile
and
joke
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
Hetty
would
look
so
,
when
he
told
her
what
he
had
to
tell
her
;
and
he
should
never
be
able
to
bear
it
 
<EOS>
he
should
be
a
fool
and
give
way
again
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
look
did
not
really
mean
so
much
as
he
thought
:
it
was
only
the
sign
of
a
struggle
between
the
desire
for
him
to
notice
her
and
the
dread
lest
she
should
betray
the
desire
to
others
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
's
face
had
a
language
that
transcended
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
There
are
faces
which
nature
charges
with
a
meaning
and
pathos
not
belonging
to
the
single
human
soul
that
flutters
beneath
them
,
but
speaking
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
foregone
generations
 
eyes
that
tell
of
deep
love
which
doubtless
has
been
and
is
somewhere
,
but
not
paired
with
these
eyes
 
perhaps
paired
with
pale
eyes
that
can
say
nothing
;
just
as
a
national
language
may
be
instinct
with
poetry
unfelt
by
the
lips
that
use
it
.
<EOS>
That
look
of
Hetty
's
oppressed
Arthur
with
a
dread
which
yet
had
something
of
a
terrible
unconfessed
delight
in
it
,
that
she
loved
him
too
well
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
hard
task
before
him
,
for
at
that
moment
he
felt
he
would
have
given
up
three
years
of
his
youth
for
the
happiness
of
abandoning
himself
without
remorse
to
his
passion
for
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
the
incongruous
thoughts
in
his
mind
as
he
led
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
panting
with
fatigue
,
and
secretly
resolving
that
neither
judge
nor
jury
should
force
her
to
dance
another
dance
,
to
take
a
quiet
rest
in
the
dining
-
room
,
where
supper
was
laid
out
for
the
guests
to
come
and
take
it
as
they
chose
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
desired
Hetty
to
remember
as
she
's
got
to
dance
wi
'
you
,
sir
,
"
said
the
good
innocent
woman
;
"
for
she
's
so
thoughtless
,
she
'd
be
like
enough
to
go
an
'
engage
herself
for
ivery
dance
.
<EOS>
So
I
told
her
not
to
promise
too
many
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
said
Arthur
,
not
without
a
twinge
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
sit
down
in
this
comfortable
chair
,
and
here
is
Mills
ready
to
give
you
what
you
would
like
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
hurried
away
to
seek
another
matronly
partner
,
for
due
honour
must
be
paid
to
the
married
women
before
he
asked
any
of
the
young
ones
;
and
the
country
-
dances
,
and
the
stamping
,
and
the
gracious
nodding
,
and
the
waving
of
the
hands
,
went
on
joyously
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
time
had
come
for
the
fourth
dance
 
longed
for
by
the
strong
,
grave
Adam
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
delicate
-
handed
youth
of
eighteen
;
for
we
are
all
very
much
alike
when
we
are
in
our
first
love
;
and
Adam
had
hardly
ever
touched
Hetty
's
hand
for
more
than
a
transient
greeting
 
had
never
danced
with
her
but
once
before
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
had
followed
her
eagerly
to
-
night
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
had
taken
in
deeper
draughts
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
thought
she
behaved
so
prettily
,
so
quietly
;
she
did
not
seem
to
be
flirting
at
all
she
smiled
less
than
usual
;
there
was
almost
a
sweet
sadness
about
her
.
"
<EOS>
God
bless
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
inwardly
;
"
I
'd
make
her
life
a
happy
'
un
,
if
a
strong
arm
to
work
for
her
,
and
a
heart
to
love
her
,
could
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
then
there
stole
over
him
delicious
thoughts
of
coming
home
from
work
,
and
drawing
Hetty
to
his
side
,
and
feeling
her
cheek
softly
pressed
against
his
,
till
he
forgot
where
he
was
,
and
the
music
and
the
tread
of
feet
might
have
been
the
falling
of
rain
and
the
roaring
of
the
wind
,
for
what
he
knew
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
the
third
dance
was
ended
,
and
he
might
go
up
to
her
and
claim
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
the
far
end
of
the
hall
near
the
staircase
,
whispering
with
Molly
,
<EOS>
who
had
just
given
the
sleeping
Totty
into
her
arms
before
running
to
fetch
shawls
and
bonnets
from
the
landing
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
had
taken
the
two
boys
away
into
the
dining
-
room
to
give
them
some
cake
before
they
went
home
in
the
cart
with
Grandfather
and
Molly
was
to
follow
as
fast
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hold
her
,
"
said
Adam
,
as
Molly
turned
upstairs
;
"
the
children
are
so
heavy
when
they
're
asleep
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
glad
of
the
relief
,
for
to
hold
Totty
in
her
arms
,
standing
,
was
not
at
all
a
pleasant
variety
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
this
second
transfer
had
the
unfortunate
effect
of
rousing
Totty
,
who
was
not
behind
any
child
of
her
age
in
peevishness
at
an
unseasonable
awaking
.
<EOS>
While
Hetty
was
in
the
act
of
placing
her
in
Adam
's
arms
,
and
had
not
yet
withdrawn
her
own
,
Totty
opened
her
eyes
,
and
forthwith
fought
out
with
her
left
fist
at
Adam
's
arm
,
and
with
her
right
caught
at
the
string
of
brown
beads
round
Hetty
's
neck
.
<EOS>
The
locket
leaped
out
from
her
frock
,
and
the
next
moment
the
string
was
broken
,
and
Hetty
,
helpless
,
saw
beads
and
locket
scattered
wide
on
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
locket
,
my
locket
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
in
a
loud
frightened
whisper
to
Adam
;
"
never
mind
the
beads
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
already
seen
where
the
locket
fell
,
for
it
had
attracted
his
glance
as
it
leaped
out
of
her
frock
.
<EOS>
It
had
fallen
on
the
raised
wooden
dais
where
the
band
sat
,
not
on
the
stone
floor
;
and
as
Adam
picked
it
up
,
he
saw
the
glass
with
the
dark
and
light
locks
of
hair
under
it
.
<EOS>
It
had
fallen
that
side
upwards
,
so
the
glass
was
not
broken
.
<EOS>
He
turned
it
over
on
his
hand
,
and
saw
the
enamelled
gold
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
hurt
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
held
it
towards
Hetty
,
who
was
unable
to
take
it
because
both
her
hands
were
occupied
with
Totty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
it
does
n't
matter
,
I
do
n't
mind
about
it
,
"
said
Hetty
,
who
had
been
pale
and
was
now
red
.
  
<EOS>
"
Not
matter
?
"
said
Adam
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
You
seemed
very
frightened
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
'll
hold
it
till
you
're
ready
to
take
it
,
"
he
added
,
quietly
closing
his
hand
over
it
,
that
she
might
not
think
he
wanted
to
look
at
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
Molly
had
come
with
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
Totty
,
Adam
placed
the
locket
in
Hetty
's
hand
.
<EOS>
She
took
it
with
an
air
of
indifference
and
put
it
in
her
pocket
,
in
her
heart
vexed
and
angry
with
Adam
because
he
had
seen
it
,
but
determined
now
that
she
would
show
no
more
signs
of
agitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
,
"
she
said
,
"
they
're
taking
their
places
to
dance
;
let
us
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
assented
silently
.
<EOS>
A
puzzled
alarm
had
taken
possession
of
him
.
<EOS>
Had
Hetty
a
lover
he
did
n't
know
of
?
<EOS>
For
none
of
her
relations
,
he
was
sure
,
would
give
her
a
locket
like
that
;
and
none
of
her
admirers
,
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
,
was
in
the
position
of
an
accepted
lover
,
as
the
giver
of
that
locket
must
be
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
lost
in
the
utter
impossibility
of
finding
any
person
for
his
fears
to
alight
on
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
feel
with
a
terrible
pang
that
there
was
something
in
Hetty
's
life
unknown
to
him
;
that
while
he
had
been
rocking
himself
in
the
hope
that
she
would
come
to
love
him
,
she
was
already
loving
another
.
<EOS>
The
pleasure
of
the
dance
with
Hetty
was
gone
;
his
eyes
,
when
they
rested
on
her
,
had
an
uneasy
questioning
expression
in
them
;
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
to
her
;
and
she
too
was
out
of
temper
and
disinclined
to
speak
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
glad
when
the
dance
was
ended
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
determined
to
stay
no
longer
;
no
one
wanted
him
,
and
no
one
would
notice
if
he
slipped
away
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
got
out
of
doors
,
he
began
to
walk
at
his
habitual
rapid
pace
,
hurrying
along
without
knowing
why
,
busy
with
the
painful
thought
that
the
memory
of
this
day
,
so
full
of
honour
and
promise
to
him
,
was
poisoned
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
when
he
was
far
on
through
the
Chase
,
he
stopped
,
startled
by
a
flash
of
reviving
hope
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
he
might
be
a
fool
,
making
a
great
misery
out
of
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
fond
of
finery
as
she
was
,
might
have
bought
the
thing
herself
.
<EOS>
It
looked
too
expensive
for
that
 
<EOS>
it
looked
like
the
things
on
white
satin
in
the
great
jeweller
's
shop
at
Rosseter
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
had
very
imperfect
notions
of
the
value
of
such
things
,
and
he
thought
it
could
certainly
not
cost
more
than
a
guinea
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
Hetty
had
had
as
much
as
that
in
Christmas
boxes
,
and
there
was
no
knowing
<EOS>
but
she
might
have
been
childish
enough
to
spend
it
in
that
way
;
she
was
such
a
young
thing
,
and
she
could
n't
help
loving
finery
!
<EOS>
But
then
,
why
had
she
been
so
frightened
about
it
at
first
,
and
changed
colour
so
,
and
afterwards
pretended
not
to
care
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
was
because
she
was
ashamed
of
his
seeing
that
she
had
such
a
smart
thing
 
<EOS>
she
was
conscious
that
it
was
wrong
for
her
to
spend
her
money
on
it
,
and
she
knew
that
Adam
disapproved
of
finery
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
proof
she
cared
about
what
he
liked
and
disliked
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
thought
from
his
silence
and
gravity
afterwards
that
he
was
very
much
displeased
with
her
,
that
he
was
inclined
to
be
harsh
and
severe
towards
her
foibles
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
walked
on
more
quietly
,
chewing
the
cud
of
this
new
hope
,
his
only
uneasiness
was
that
he
had
behaved
in
a
way
which
might
chill
Hetty
's
feeling
towards
him
.
<EOS>
For
this
last
view
of
the
matter
must
be
the
true
one
.
<EOS>
How
could
Hetty
have
an
accepted
lover
,
quite
unknown
to
him
?
<EOS>
She
was
never
away
from
her
uncle
's
house
for
more
than
a
day
;
she
could
have
no
acquaintances
that
did
not
come
there
,
and
no
intimacies
unknown
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
folly
to
believe
that
the
locket
was
given
to
her
by
a
lover
.
<EOS>
The
little
ring
of
dark
hair
he
felt
sure
was
her
own
;
he
could
form
no
guess
about
the
light
hair
under
it
,
for
he
had
not
seen
it
very
distinctly
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
a
bit
of
her
father
's
or
mother
's
,
who
had
died
when
she
was
a
child
,
and
she
would
naturally
put
a
bit
of
her
own
along
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
Adam
went
to
bed
comforted
,
having
woven
for
himself
an
ingenious
web
of
probabilities
 
the
surest
screen
a
wise
man
can
place
between
himself
and
the
truth
.
<EOS>
His
last
waking
thoughts
melted
into
a
dream
that
he
was
with
Hetty
again
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
that
he
was
asking
her
to
forgive
him
for
being
so
cold
and
silent
.
  
<EOS>
And
while
he
was
dreaming
this
,
Arthur
was
leading
Hetty
to
the
dance
and
saying
to
her
in
low
hurried
tones
,
"
I
shall
be
in
the
wood
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
at
seven
;
come
as
early
as
you
can
.
"
<EOS>
And
Hetty
's
foolish
joys
and
hopes
,
which
had
flown
away
for
a
little
space
,
scared
by
a
mere
nothing
,
now
all
came
fluttering
back
,
unconscious
of
the
real
peril
.
<EOS>
She
was
happy
for
the
first
time
this
long
day
,
and
wished
that
dance
would
last
for
hours
.
<EOS>
Arthur
wished
it
too
;
it
was
the
last
weakness
he
meant
to
indulge
in
;
and
a
man
never
lies
with
more
delicious
languor
under
the
influence
of
a
passion
than
when
he
has
persuaded
himself
that
he
shall
subdue
it
to
-
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
But
Mrs.
Poyser
's
wishes
were
quite
the
reverse
of
this
,
for
her
mind
was
filled
with
dreary
forebodings
as
to
the
retardation
of
to
-
morrow
morning
's
cheese
in
consequence
of
these
late
hours
.
<EOS>
Now
that
Hetty
had
done
her
duty
and
danced
one
dance
with
the
young
squire
,
Mr.
Poyser
must
go
out
and
see
if
the
cart
was
come
back
to
fetch
them
,
for
it
was
half
-
past
ten
o'clock
,
and
notwithstanding
a
mild
suggestion
on
his
part
that
it
would
be
bad
manners
for
them
to
be
the
first
to
go
,
Mrs.
Poyser
was
resolute
on
the
point
,
"
manners
or
no
manners
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Going
already
,
Mrs.
Poyser
?
<EOS>
"
said
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
as
she
came
to
curtsy
and
take
leave
;
"
I
thought
we
should
not
part
with
any
of
our
guests
till
eleven
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Irwine
and
I
,
who
are
elderly
people
,
think
of
sitting
out
the
dance
till
then
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Your
Honour
,
it
's
all
right
and
proper
for
gentlefolks
to
stay
up
by
candlelight
 
<EOS>
they

got
no
cheese
on
their

<EOS>
We

So

if
you
'll

excuse

<EOS>
,
we
'll
take
our
leave

<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh

"
<EOS>
she
said
to
her
husband
,
as
they
set
off
in
the
cart
,
"
I
'd
sooner
ha

brewin

"
  
"
Nay

"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
was
in
his
merriest
mood
,
and
felt
that
he
had
had
a
great
day
,
"

An

<EOS>

honour
for

young

to
ask

<EOS>
I

when
you

A
crisis
  
<EOS>
IT
was
beyond
the
middle
of
August
 
nearly
three
weeks
after
the
birthday
feast
.
<EOS>
The
reaping
of
the
wheat
had
begun
in
our
north
midland
county
of
Loamshire
,
but
the
harvest
was
likely
still
to
be
retarded
by
the
heavy
rains
,
which
were
causing
inundations
and
much
damage
throughout
the
country
.
<EOS>
From
this
last
trouble
the
Broxton
and
Hayslope
farmers
,
on
their
pleasant
uplands
and
in
their
brook
-
watered
valleys
,
had
not
suffered
,
and
as
I
can
not
pretend
that
they
were
such
exceptional
farmers
as
to
love
the
general
good
better
than
their
own
,
you
will
infer
that
they
were
not
in
very
low
spirits
about
the
rapid
rise
in
the
price
of
bread
,
so
long
as
there
was
hope
of
gathering
in
their
own
corn
undamaged
;
and
occasional
days
of
sunshine
and
drying
winds
flattered
this
hope
.
  
<EOS>
The
eighteenth
of
August
was
one
of
these
days
when
the
sunshine
looked
brighter
in
all
eyes
for
the
gloom
that
went
before
.
<EOS>
Grand
masses
of
cloud
were
hurried
across
the
blue
,
and
the
great
round
hills
behind
the
Chase
seemed
alive
with
their
flying
shadows
;
the
sun
was
hidden
for
a
moment
,
and
then
shone
out
warm
again
like
a
recovered
joy
;
the
leaves
,
still
green
,
were
tossed
off
the
hedgerow
trees
by
the
wind
;
around
the
farmhouses
there
was
a
sound
of
clapping
doors
;
the
apples
fell
in
the
orchards
;
and
the
stray
horses
on
the
green
sides
of
the
lanes
and
on
the
common
had
their
manes
blown
about
their
faces
.
<EOS>
And
yet
the
wind
seemed
only
part
of
the
general
gladness
because
the
sun
was
shining
.
<EOS>
A
merry
day
for
the
children
,
who
ran
and
shouted
to
see
if
they
could
top
the
wind
with
their
voices
;
and
the
grown
-
up
people
too
were
in
good
spirits
,
inclined
to
believe
in
yet
finer
days
,
when
the
wind
had
fallen
.
<EOS>
If
only
the
corn
were
not
ripe
enough
to
be
blown
out
of
the
husk
and
scattered
as
untimely
seed
!
  
<EOS>
And
yet
a
day
on
which
a
blighting
sorrow
may
fall
upon
a
man
.
<EOS>
For
if
it
be
true
that
Nature
at
certain
moments
seems
charged
with
a
presentiment
of
one
individual
lot
must
it
not
also
be
true
that
she
seems
unmindful
unconscious
of
another
?
<EOS>
For
there
is
no
hour
that
has
not
its
births
of
gladness
and
despair
,
no
morning
brightness
that
does
not
bring
new
sickness
to
desolation
as
well
as
new
forces
to
genius
and
love
.
<EOS>
There
are
so
many
of
us
,
and
our
lots
are
so
different
,
<EOS>
what
wonder
that
Nature
's
mood
is
often
in
harsh
contrast
with
the
great
crisis
of
our
lives
?
<EOS>
We
are
children
of
a
large
family
,
and
must
learn
,
<EOS>
as
such
children
do
,
not
to
expect
that
our
hurts
will
be
made
much
of
 
to
be
content
with
little
nurture
and
caressing
,
and
help
each
other
the
more
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
busy
day
with
Adam
,
who
of
late
had
done
almost
double
work
,
for
he
was
continuing
to
act
as
foreman
for
Jonathan
Burge
,
until
some
satisfactory
person
could
be
found
to
supply
his
place
,
and
Jonathan
was
slow
to
find
that
person
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
done
the
extra
work
cheerfully
,
for
his
hopes
were
buoyant
again
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Every
time
she
had
seen
him
since
the
birthday
,
she
had
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
behave
all
the
more
kindly
to
him
,
that
she
might
make
him
understand
she
had
forgiven
his
silence
and
coldness
during
the
dance
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
mentioned
the
locket
to
her
again
;
too
happy
that
she
smiled
at
him
 
still
happier
because
he
observed
in
her
a
more
subdued
air
,
something
that
he
interpreted
as
the
growth
of
womanly
tenderness
and
seriousness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
thought
,
again
and
again
,
"
she
's
only
seventeen
;
she
'll
be
thoughtful
enough
after
a
while
.
<EOS>
And
her
aunt
allays
says
how
clever
she
is
at
the
work
.
<EOS>
She
'll
make
a
wife
as
Mother'll
have
no
occasion
to
grumble
at
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
,
he
had
only
seen
her
at
home
twice
since
the
birthday
;
for
one
Sunday
,
when
he
was
intending
to
go
from
church
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
Hetty
had
joined
the
party
of
upper
servants
from
the
Chase
and
had
gone
home
with
them
 
almost
as
if
she
were
inclined
to
encourage
Mr.
Craig
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
takin
'
too
much
likin
'
to
them
<EOS>
folks
<EOS>
i
'
the
house
keeper
's
room
,
"
Mrs.
Poyser
remarked
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
part
,
I
was
never
overfond
<EOS>
o
'
gentlefolks
's
servants
 
<EOS>
they
're
mostly
like
the
fine
ladies
'
fat
dogs
,
nayther
good
for
barking
nor
butcher
's
meat
,
but
on'y
for
show
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
another
evening
she
was
gone
to
Treddleston
to
buy
some
things
;
though
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
as
he
was
returning
home
,
he
saw
her
at
a
distance
getting
over
a
stile
quite
out
of
the
Treddleston
road
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
he
hastened
to
her
,
she
was
very
kind
,
and
asked
him
to
go
in
again
when
he
had
taken
her
to
the
yard
gate
.
<EOS>
She
had
gone
a
little
farther
into
the
fields
after
coming
from
Treddleston
because
she
did
n't
want
to
go
in
<EOS>
,
she
said
:
it
was
so
nice
to
be
out
of
doors
,
and
her
aunt
always
made
such
a
fuss
about
it
if
she
wanted
to
go
out
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
do
come
in
with
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
as
he
was
going
to
shake
hands
with
her
at
the
gate
,
and
he
could
not
resist
that
.
<EOS>
So
he
went
in
,
and
Mrs.
Poyser
was
contented
with
only
a
slight
remark
on
Hetty
's
being
later
than
was
expected
;
while
Hetty
,
who
had
looked
out
of
spirits
when
he
met
her
,
smiled
and
talked
and
waited
on
them
all
with
unusual
promptitude
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
the
last
time
he
had
seen
her
;
but
he
meant
to
make
leisure
for
going
to
the
Farm
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
he
knew
,
was
her
day
for
going
to
the
Chase
to
sew
with
the
lady
's
maid
,
so
he
would
get
as
much
work
done
as
possible
this
evening
,
that
the
next
might
be
clear
.
  
<EOS>
One
piece
of
work
that
Adam
was
superintending
was
some
slight
repairs
at
the
Chase
Farm
,
which
had
been
hitherto
occupied
by
Satchell
,
as
bailiff
,
but
<EOS>
which
it
was
now
rumoured
that
the
old
squire
was
going
to
let
to
a
smart
man
in
top
-
boots
,
who
had
been
seen
to
ride
over
it
one
day
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
desire
to
get
a
tenant
could
account
for
the
squire
's
undertaking
repairs
,
though
the
Saturday
-
evening
party
at
Mr.
Casson
's
agreed
over
their
pipes
that
no
man
in
his
senses
would
take
the
Chase
Farm
unless
there
was
a
bit
more
ploughland
laid
to
it
.
<EOS>
However
that
might
be
,
the
repairs
were
ordered
to
be
executed
with
all
dispatch
,
and
Adam
,
acting
for
Mr.
Burge
,
was
carrying
out
the
order
with
his
usual
energy
.
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
,
having
been
occupied
elsewhere
,
he
had
not
been
able
to
arrive
at
the
Chase
Farm
till
late
in
the
afternoon
,
and
he
then
discovered
that
some
old
roofing
,
which
he
had
calculated
on
preserving
,
had
given
way
.
<EOS>
There
was
clearly
no
good
to
be
done
with
this
part
of
the
building
without
pulling
it
all
down
,
and
Adam
immediately
saw
in
his
mind
a
plan
for
building
it
up
again
,
so
as
to
make
the
most
convenient
of
cow
-
sheds
and
calf
-
pens
,
with
a
hovel
for
implements
;
and
all
without
any
great
expense
for
materials
.
<EOS>
So
,
when
the
workmen
were
gone
,
he
sat
down
,
took
out
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
busied
himself
with
sketching
a
plan
,
and
making
a
specification
of
the
expenses
that
he
might
show
it
to
Burge
the
next
morning
,
and
set
him
on
persuading
the
squire
to
consent
.
<EOS>
To
"
make
a
good
job
"
of
anything
,
however
small
,
was
always
a
pleasure
to
Adam
,
and
he
sat
on
a
block
,
with
his
book
resting
on
a
planing
-
table
,
whistling
low
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
and
turning
his
head
on
one
side
with
a
just
perceptible
smile
of
gratification
 
of
pride
,
too
,
<EOS>
for
if
Adam
loved
a
bit
of
good
work
,
he
loved
also
to
think
,
"
I
did
it
!
"
<EOS>
And
I
believe
the
only
people
who
are
free
from
that
weakness
are
those
who
have
no
work
to
call
their
own
.
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
seven
before
he
had
finished
and
put
on
his
jacket
again
;
and
on
giving
a
last
look
round
,
he
observed
that
Seth
,
who
had
been
working
here
to
-
day
,
had
left
his
basket
of
tools
behind
him
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
th
'
lad
's
forgot
his
tools
,
"
thought
Adam
,
"
and
he
's
got
to
work
up
at
the
shop
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
chap
for
wool
-
gathering
;
he
'd
leave
his
head
behind
him
,
if
it
was
loose
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
's
lucky
<EOS>
I
've
seen
'em
;
I
'll
carry
'em
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
buildings
of
the
Chase
Farm
lay
at
one
extremity
of
the
Chase
,
at
about
ten
minutes
'
walking
distance
from
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
come
thither
on
his
pony
,
intending
to
ride
to
the
stables
and
put
up
his
nag
on
his
way
home
.
<EOS>
At
the
stables
he
encountered
Mr.
Craig
,
who
had
come
to
look
at
the
captain
's
new
horse
,
on
which
he
was
to
ride
away
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
;
and
Mr.
Craig
detained
him
to
tell
how
all
the
servants
were
to
collect
at
the
gate
of
the
courtyard
to
wish
the
young
squire
luck
as
he
rode
out
;
so
that
by
the
time
Adam
had
got
into
the
Chase
,
and
was
striding
along
with
the
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
<EOS>
,
the
sun
was
on
the
point
of
setting
,
and
was
sending
level
crimson
rays
among
the
great
trunks
of
the
old
oaks
,
and
touching
every
bare
patch
of
ground
with
a
transient
glory
that
made
it
look
like
a
jewel
dropt
upon
the
grass
.
<EOS>
The
wind
had
fallen
now
,
and
there
was
only
enough
breeze
to
stir
the
delicate
-
stemmed
leaves
.
<EOS>
Any
one
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
house
all
day
would
have
been
glad
to
walk
now
;
but
Adam
had
been
quite
enough
in
the
open
air
to
wish
to
shorten
his
way
home
,
and
he
bethought
himself
that
he
might
do
so
by
striking
across
the
Chase
and
going
through
the
Grove
,
where
he
had
never
been
for
years
.
<EOS>
He
hurried
on
across
the
Chase
,
stalking
along
the
narrow
paths
between
the
fern
,
with
Gyp
at
his
heels
,
not
lingering
to
watch
the
magnificent
changes
of
the
light
 
hardly
once
thinking
of
it
 
yet
feeling
its
presence
in
a
certain
calm
happy
awe
which
mingled
itself
with
his
busy
working
-
day
thoughts
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
help
feeling
it
?
<EOS>
The
very
deer
felt
it
,
and
were
more
timid
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
Adam
's
thoughts
recurred
to
what
Mr.
Craig
had
said
about
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
and
pictured
his
going
away
,
and
the
changes
that
might
take
place
before
he
came
back
;
then
they
travelled
back
affectionately
over
the
old
scenes
of
boyish
companionship
,
and
dwelt
on
Arthur
's
good
qualities
,
which
Adam
had
a
pride
in
,
as
we
all
have
in
the
virtues
of
the
superior
who
honours
us
.
<EOS>
A
nature
like
Adam
's
,
with
a
great
need
of
love
and
reverence
in
it
,
depends
for
so
much
of
its
happiness
on
what
it
can
believe
and
feel
about
others
!
<EOS>
And
he
had
no
ideal
world
of
dead
heroes
;
he
knew
little
of
the
life
of
men
in
the
past
;
he
must
find
the
beings
to
whom
he
could
cling
with
loving
admiration
among
those
who
came
within
speech
of
him
.
<EOS>
These
pleasant
thoughts
about
Arthur
brought
a
milder
expression
than
usual
into
his
keen
rough
face
:
perhaps
they
were
the
reason
why
,
when
he
opened
the
old
green
gate
leading
into
the
Grove
,
he
paused
to
pat
Gyp
and
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
pause
,
he
strode
on
again
along
the
broad
winding
path
through
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
What
grand
beeches
!
<EOS>
Adam
delighted
in
a
fine
tree
of
all
things
;
as
the
fisherman
's
sight
is
keenest
on
the
sea
,
so
Adam
's
perceptions
were
more
at
home
with
trees
than
with
other
objects
.
<EOS>
He
kept
them
in
his
memory
,
as
a
painter
does
,
with
all
the
flecks
and
knots
in
their
bark
,
all
the
curves
and
angles
of
their
boughs
,
and
had
often
calculated
the
height
and
contents
of
a
trunk
to
a
nicety
,
as
he
stood
looking
at
it
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
that
,
not
-
withstanding
his
desire
to
get
on
<EOS>
,
he
could
not
help
pausing
to
look
at
a
curious
large
beech
which
he
had
seen
standing
before
him
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
and
convince
himself
that
it
was
not
two
trees
wedded
together
,
but
only
one
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
of
his
life
he
remembered
that
moment
when
he
was
calmly
examining
the
beech
,
as
a
man
remembers
his
last
glimpse
of
the
home
where
his
youth
was
passed
,
before
the
road
turned
,
and
he
saw
it
no
more
.
<EOS>
The
beech
stood
at
the
last
turning
before
the
Grove
ended
in
an
archway
of
boughs
that
let
in
the
eastern
light
;
and
as
Adam
stepped
away
from
the
tree
to
continue
his
walk
,
his
eyes
fell
on
two
figures
about
twenty
yards
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
as
motionless
as
a
statue
,
and
turned
almost
as
pale
.
<EOS>
The
two
figures
were
standing
opposite
to
each
other
,
with
clasped
hands
about
to
part
;
and
while
they
were
bending
to
kiss
,
Gyp
,
who
had
been
running
among
the
brushwood
,
came
out
,
caught
sight
of
them
,
and
gave
a
sharp
bark
.
<EOS>
They
separated
with
a
start
 
one
hurried
through
the
gate
out
of
the
Grove
,
and
the
other
,
turning
round
,
walked
slowly
,
with
a
sort
of
saunter
,
towards
Adam
who
still
stood
transfixed
and
pale
,
clutching
tighter
the
stick
with
which
he
held
the
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
,
and
looking
at
the
approaching
figure
with
eyes
in
which
amazement
was
fast
turning
to
fierceness
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
Donnithorne
looked
flushed
and
excited
;
he
had
tried
to
make
unpleasant
feelings
more
bearable
by
drinking
a
little
more
wine
than
usual
at
dinner
to
-
day
,
and
was
still
enough
under
its
flattering
influence
to
think
more
lightly
of
this
unwished
-
for
rencontre
with
Adam
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
Adam
was
the
best
person
who
could
have
happened
to
see
him
and
Hetty
together
 
<EOS>
he
was
a
sensible
fellow
,
and
would
not
babble
about
it
to
other
people
.
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
confident
that
he
could
laugh
the
thing
off
and
explain
it
away
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
sauntered
forward
with
elaborate
carelessness
 
<EOS>
his
flushed
face
,
his
evening
dress
of
fine
cloth
and
fine
linen
,
his
hands
half
-
thrust
into
his
waistcoat
pockets
,
all
shone
upon
by
the
strange
evening
light
which
the
light
clouds
had
caught
up
even
to
the
zenith
,
and
were
now
shedding
down
between
the
topmost
branches
above
him
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
still
motionless
,
looking
at
him
as
he
came
up
.
<EOS>
He
understood
it
all
now
 
<EOS>
the
locket
and
everything
else
that
had
been
doubtful
to
him
:
a
terrible
scorching
light
showed
him
the
hidden
letters
that
changed
the
meaning
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
moved
a
muscle
,
he
must
inevitably
have
sprung
upon
Arthur
like
a
tiger
;
and
in
the
conflicting
emotions
that
filled
those
long
moments
,
he
had
told
himself
that
he
would
not
give
loose
to
passion
,
he
would
only
speak
the
right
thing
.
<EOS>
He
stood
as
if
petrified
by
an
unseen
force
,
but
the
force
was
his
own
strong
will
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Adam
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
you
've
been
looking
at
the
fine
old
beeches
,
eh
?
<EOS>
They
're
not
to
be
come
near
by
the
hatchet
,
though
;
this
is
a
sacred
grove
.
<EOS>
I
overtook
pretty
little
Hetty
Sorrel
as
I
was
coming
to
my
den
 
<EOS>
the
Hermitage
,
there
.
<EOS>
She
ought
not
to
come
home
this
way
so
late
.
<EOS>
So
I
took
care
of
her
to
the
gate
,
and
asked
for
a
kiss
for
my
pains
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
get
back
now
,
for
this
road
is
confoundedly
damp
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
shall
see
you
to
-
morrow
 
to
say
good
-
bye
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
was
too
much
preoccupied
with
the
part
he
was
playing
himself
to
be
thoroughly
aware
of
the
expression
in
Adam
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
look
directly
at
Adam
,
but
glanced
carelessly
round
at
the
trees
and
then
lifted
up
one
foot
to
look
at
the
sole
of
his
boot
.
<EOS>
He
cared
to
say
no
more
 
he
had
thrown
quite
dust
enough
into
honest
Adam
's
eyes
 
and
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
the
last
words
,
he
walked
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
in
a
hard
peremptory
voice
,
without
turning
round
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
got
a
word
to
say
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
paused
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
Susceptible
persons
are
more
affected
by
a
change
of
tone
than
by
unexpected
words
,
and
Arthur
had
the
susceptibility
of
a
nature
at
once
affectionate
and
vain
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
more
surprised
when
he
saw
that
Adam
had
not
moved
,
but
stood
with
his
back
to
him
,
as
if
summoning
him
to
return
.
<EOS>
What
did
he
mean
?
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
make
a
serious
business
of
this
affair
.
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
his
temper
rising
.
<EOS>
A
patronising
disposition
always
has
its
meaner
side
,
and
in
the
confusion
of
his
irritation
and
alarm
there
entered
the
feeling
that
a
man
to
whom
he
had
shown
so
much
favour
as
to
Adam
was
not
in
a
position
to
criticize
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
And
yet
he
was
dominated
,
as
one
who
feels
himself
in
the
wrong
always
is
,
by
the
man
whose
good
opinion
he
cares
for
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
pride
and
temper
,
there
was
as
much
deprecation
as
anger
in
his
voice
when
he
said
,
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
sir
"
 
answered
Adam
,
in
the
same
harsh
voice
,
still
without
turning
round
 
<EOS>
"
I
mean
,
sir
,
that
you
do
n't
deceive
me
by
your
light
words
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
first
time
you
've
met
Hetty
Sorrel
in
this
grove
,
and
this
is
not
the
first
time
you
've
kissed
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
a
startled
uncertainty
how
far
Adam
was
speaking
from
knowledge
,
and
how
far
from
mere
inference
.
<EOS>
And
this
uncertainty
,
which
prevented
him
from
contriving
a
prudent
answer
,
heightened
his
irritation
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
in
a
high
sharp
tone
,
"
Well
,
sir
,
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
then
,
instead
of
acting
like
th
'
upright
,
honourable
man
we
've
all
believed
you
to
be
,
you
've
been
acting
the
part
of
a
selfish
light
-
minded
scoundrel
.
<EOS>
You
know
as
well
as
I
do
what
it
's
to
lead
to
when
a
gentleman
like
you
kisses
and
makes
love
to
a
young
woman
like
Hetty
,
and
gives
her
presents
as
she
's
frightened
for
other
folks
to
see
.
<EOS>
And
I
say
it
again
,
you
're
acting
the
part
of
a
selfish
light
-
minded
scoundrel
though
it
cuts
me
to
th
'
heart
to
say
so
,
and
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
ha
'
lost
my
right
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
me
tell
you
,
Adam
,
"
said
Arthur
,
bridling
his
growing
anger
and
trying
to
recur
to
his
careless
tone
,
"
you
're
not
only
devilishly
impertinent
,
but
you
're
talking
nonsense
.
<EOS>
Every
pretty
girl
is
not
such
a
fool
as
you
,
to
suppose
that
when
a
gentleman
admires
her
beauty
and
pays
her
a
little
attention
,
he
must
mean
something
particular
.
<EOS>
Every
man
likes
to
flirt
with
a
pretty
girl
,
and
every
pretty
girl
likes
to
be
flirted
with
.
<EOS>
The
wider
the
distance
between
them
<EOS>
,
the
less
harm
there
is
,
for
then
she
's
not
likely
to
deceive
herself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
flirting
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
<EOS>
but
if
you
mean
behaving
to
a
woman
as
if
you
loved
her
,
and
yet
not
loving
her
all
the
while
,
I
say
that
's
not
th
'
action
of
an
honest
man
,
and
what
is
n't
honest
does
come
t
'
harm
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
a
fool
,
and
you
're
not
a
fool
,
and
you
know
better
than
what
you
're
saying
.
<EOS>
You
know
it
could
n't
be
made
public
as
you
've
behaved
to
Hetty
as
y
'
have
done
without
her
losing
her
character
and
bringing
shame
and
trouble
on
her
and
her
relations
.
<EOS>
What
if
you
meant
nothing
by
your
kissing
and
your
presents
?
<EOS>
Other
folks
wo
n't
believe
as
you
've
meant
nothing
;
and
do
n't
tell
me
about
her
not
deceiving
herself
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
as
you
've
filled
her
mind
so
with
the
thought
of
you
as
it
'll
mayhap
poison
her
life
,
and
she
'll
never
love
another
man
as
'
ud
<EOS>
make
her
a
good
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
had
felt
a
sudden
relief
while
Adam
was
speaking
;
he
perceived
that
Adam
had
no
positive
knowledge
of
the
past
,
and
that
there
was
no
irrevocable
damage
done
by
this
evening
's
unfortunate
rencontre
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
still
be
deceived
.
<EOS>
The
candid
Arthur
had
brought
himself
into
a
position
in
which
successful
lying
was
his
only
hope
.
<EOS>
The
hope
allayed
his
anger
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Adam
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
friendly
concession
,
"
you
're
perhaps
right
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
've
gone
a
little
too
far
in
taking
notice
of
the
pretty
little
thing
and
stealing
a
kiss
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
You
're
such
a
grave
,
steady
fellow
,
you
do
n't
understand
the
temptation
to
such
trifling
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
would
n't
bring
any
trouble
or
annoyance
on
her
and
the
good
Poysers
on
any
account
if
I
could
help
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
you
look
a
little
too
seriously
at
it
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
'm
going
away
immediately
,
so
I
sha
n't
make
any
more
mistakes
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
say
<EOS>
good
-
night
"
 
Arthur
here
turned
round
to
walk
on
 
"
and
talk
no
more
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
will
soon
be
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
God
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
burst
out
with
rage
that
could
be
controlled
no
longer
,
throwing
down
the
basket
of
tools
and
striding
forward
till
he
was
right
in
front
of
Arthur
.
<EOS>
All
his
jealousy
and
sense
of
personal
injury
,
which
he
had
been
hitherto
trying
to
keep
under
,
had
leaped
up
and
mastered
him
.
<EOS>
What
man
of
us
,
in
the
first
moments
of
a
sharp
agony
,
could
ever
feel
that
the
fellow
-
man
who
has
been
the
medium
of
inflicting
it
did
not
mean
to
hurt
us
?
<EOS>
In
our
instinctive
rebellion
against
pain
,
we
are
children
again
,
and
demand
an
active
will
to
wreak
our
vengeance
on
.
<EOS>
Adam
at
this
moment
could
only
feel
that
he
had
been
robbed
of
Hetty
 
robbed
treacherously
by
the
man
in
whom
he
had
trusted
 
<EOS>
and
he
stood
close
in
front
of
Arthur
,
with
fierce
eyes
glaring
at
him
,
with
pale
lips
and
clenched
hands
,
the
hard
tones
in
which
he
had
hitherto
been
constraining
himself
to
express
no
more
than
a
just
indignation
giving
way
to
a
deep
agitated
voice
that
seemed
to
shake
him
as
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
it
'll
not
be
soon
forgot
,
as
you
've
come
in
between
her
and
me
,
when
she
might
ha
'
loved
me
 
<EOS>
it
'll
not
soon
be
forgot
as
you
've
robbed
me
o
'
<EOS>
my
happiness
,
while
I
thought
you
was
my
best
friend
,
and
a
noble
-
minded
man
,
as
I
was
proud
to
work
for
.
<EOS>
And
you
've
been
kissing
her
,
and
meaning
nothing
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
And
I
never
kissed
her
<EOS>
i

my
life
 
<EOS>
but
I
'd
ha
'
worked
hard
for
years
for
the
right
to
kiss
her
.
<EOS>
And
you
make
light
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
think
little
o

doing
what
may
damage
other
folks
,
so
as
you
get
your
bit

trifling

as
means
nothing

I
throw
back
your
favours

for
you
're
not
the
man
I
took
you
for

I
'll
never
count
you
my
friend
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
'd
rather
you
'd
act
as
my
enemy
,
and
fight
me
where
I
stand
 
<EOS>
it
's
all
th

amends
<EOS>
you
can
make
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Adam
,
possessed
by
rage
that
could
find
no
other
vent
,
began
to
throw
off
his
coat
and
his
cap
,
too
blind
with
passion
to
notice
the
change
that
had
taken
place
in
Arthur
while
he
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
Arthur
's
lips
were
now
as
pale
as
Adam
's
;
his
heart
was
beating
violently
.
<EOS>
The
discovery
that
Adam
loved
Hetty
was
a
shock
which
made
him
for
the
moment
see
himself
in
the
light
of
Adam
's
indignation
,
and
regard
Adam
's
suffering
as
not
merely
a
consequence
,
but
an
element
of
his
error
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
hatred
and
contempt
 
the
first
he
had
ever
heard
in
his
life
 
seemed
like
scorching
missiles
that
were
making
ineffaceable
scars
on
him
.
<EOS>
All
screening
self
-
excuse
,
which
rarely
falls
quite
away
while
others
respect
us
,
forsook
him
for
an
instant
,
and
he
stood
face
to
face
with
the
first
great
irrevocable
evil
he
had
ever
committed
.
<EOS>
He
was
only
twenty
-
one
,
and
three
months
ago
 
nay
,
much
later
 
<EOS>
he
had
thought
proudly
that
no
man
should
ever
be
able
to
reproach
him
justly
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
,
if
there
had
been
time
for
it
,
would
perhaps
have
been
to
utter
words
of
propitiation
;
but
Adam
had
no
sooner
thrown
off
his
coat
and
cap
than
he
became
aware
that
Arthur
was
standing
pale
and
motionless
,
with
his
hands
still
thrust
in
his
waistcoat
pockets
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
wo
n't
you
fight
me
like
a
man
?
<EOS>
You
know
I
wo
n't
strike
you
while
you
stand
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
away
,
Adam
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
I
do
n't
want
to
fight
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Adam
,
bitterly
;
"
you
do
n't
want
to
fight
me
 
<EOS>
you
think
I
'm
a
common
man
,
as
you
can
injure
without
answering
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
meant
to
injure
you
,
"
said
Arthur
,
with
returning
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
know
you
loved
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
've
made
her
love
you
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
a
double
-
faced
man
 
<EOS>
I
'll
never
believe
a
word
you
say
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Go
away
,
I
tell
you
,
"
said
Arthur
,
angrily
,
"
or
we
shall
both
repent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Adam
,
with
a
convulsed
voice
,
"
I
swear
I
wo
n't
go
away
without
fighting
you
.
<EOS>
Do
you
want
provoking
any
more
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
you
're
a
coward
and
a
scoundrel
,
and
I
despise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
colour
had
all
rushed
back
to
Arthur
's
face
;
in
a
moment
his
right
hand
was
clenched
,
and
dealt
a
blow
like
lightning
,
which
sent
Adam
staggering
backward
.
<EOS>
His
blood
was
as
thoroughly
up
as
Adam
's
now
,
and
the
two
men
,
forgetting
the
emotions
that
had
gone
before
,
fought
with
the
instinctive
fierceness
of
panthers
in
the
deepening
twilight
darkened
by
the
trees
.
<EOS>
The
delicate
-
handed
gentleman
was
a
match
for
the
workman
in
everything
but
strength
,
and
Arthur
's
skill
enabled
him
to
protract
the
struggle
for
some
long
moments
.
<EOS>
But
between
unarmed
men
the
battle
is
to
the
strong
,
where
the
strong
is
no
blunderer
,
and
Arthur
must
sink
under
a
well
-
planted
blow
of
Adam
's
as
a
steel
rod
is
broken
by
an
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
The
blow
soon
came
,
and
Arthur
fell
,
his
head
lying
concealed
in
a
tuft
of
fern
,
so
that
Adam
could
only
discern
his
darkly
clad
body
.
  
<EOS>
He
stood
still
in
the
dim
light
waiting
for
Arthur
to
rise
.
  
<EOS>
The
blow
had
been
given
now
,
towards
which
he
had
been
straining
all
the
force
of
nerve
and
muscle
 
and
what
was
the
good
of
it
?
<EOS>
What
had
he
done
by
fighting
?
<EOS>
Only
satisfied
his
own
passion
,
only
wreaked
his
own
vengeance
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
rescued
Hetty
,
nor
changed
the
past
 
there
<EOS>
it
was
,
just
as
it
had
been
,
and
he
sickened
at
the
vanity
of
his
own
rage
.
  
<EOS>
But
why
did
not
Arthur
rise
?
<EOS>
He
was
perfectly
motionless
,
and
the
time
seemed
long
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
had
the
blow
been
too
much
for
him
?
<EOS>
Adam
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
his
own
strength
,
as
with
the
oncoming
of
this
dread
he
knelt
down
by
Arthur
's
side
and
lifted
his
head
from
among
the
fern
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sign
of
life
:
the
eyes
and
teeth
were
set
.
<EOS>
The
horror
that
rushed
over
Adam
completely
mastered
him
,
and
forced
upon
him
its
own
belief
.
<EOS>
He
could
feel
nothing
but
that
death
was
in
Arthur
's
face
,
and
that
he
was
helpless
before
it
.
<EOS>
He
made
not
a
single
movement
,
but
knelt
like
an
image
of
despair
gazing
at
an
image
of
death
.
    
<EOS>
A
Dilemma
  
<EOS>
IT
was
only
a
few
minutes
measured
by
the
clock
 
though
Adam
always
thought
it
had
been
a
long
while
 
before
he
perceived
a
gleam
of
consciousness
in
Arthur
's
face
and
a
slight
shiver
through
his
frame
.
<EOS>
The
intense
joy
that
flooded
his
soul
brought
back
some
of
the
old
affection
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
any
pain
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
tenderly
,
loosening
Arthur
's
cravat
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
turned
his
eyes
on
Adam
with
a
vague
stare
which
gave
way
to
a
slightly
startled
motion
as
if
from
the
shock
of
returning
memory
.
<EOS>
But
he
only
shivered
again
and
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
any
hurt
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
Adam
said
again
,
with
a
trembling
in
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
put
his
hand
up
to
his
waistcoat
buttons
,
and
when
Adam
had
unbuttoned
it
,
he
took
a
longer
breath
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lay
my
head
down
,
"
he
said
,
faintly
,
"
and
get
me
some
water
if
you
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
laid
the
head
down
gently
on
the
fern
again
,
and
emptying
the
tools
out
of
the
flag
-
basket
,
hurried
through
the
trees
to
the
edge
of
the
Grove
bordering
on
the
Chase
,
where
a
brook
ran
below
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
returned
with
his
basket
leaking
,
but
still
half
-
full
,
Arthur
looked
at
him
with
a
more
thoroughly
reawakened
consciousness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
drink
a
drop
out
o
'
your
hand
,
sir
?
"
said
Adam
,
kneeling
down
again
to
lift
up
Arthur
's
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Arthur
,
"
dip
my
cravat
in
and
souse
it
on
my
head
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
water
seemed
to
do
him
some
good
,
for
he
presently
raised
himself
a
little
higher
,
resting
on
Adam
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
feel
any
hurt
inside
sir
?
"
<EOS>
Adam
asked
again
  
"
No
 
<EOS>
no
hurt
,
"
said
Arthur
,
still
faintly
,
"
but
rather
done
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
while
he
said
,
"
I
suppose
I
fainted
away
when
you
knocked
me
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
thank
God
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
worse
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
You
thought
you
'd
done
for
me
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Come
help
me
on
my
legs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
terribly
shaky
and
dizzy
,
"
Arthur
said
,
as
he
stood
leaning
on
Adam
's
arm
;
"
that
blow
of
yours
must
have
come
against
me
like
a
battering
-
ram
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
I
can
walk
alone
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lean
on
me
,
sir
;
I
'll
get
you
along
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
Or
,
will
you
sit
down
a
bit
longer
,
on
my
coat
here
,
and
I
'll
prop
y
'
up
.
<EOS>
You
'll
perhaps
be
better
in
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
to
the
Hermitage
 
<EOS>
I
think
I
've
got
some
brandy
there
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
short
road
to
it
a
little
farther
on
,
near
the
gate
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
just
help
me
on
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
slowly
,
with
frequent
pauses
,
but
without
speaking
again
.
<EOS>
In
both
of
them
,
the
concentration
in
the
present
which
had
attended
the
first
moments
of
Arthur
's
revival
had
now
given
way
to
a
vivid
recollection
of
the
previous
scene
.
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
dark
in
the
narrow
path
among
the
trees
,
but
within
the
circle
of
fir
-
trees
round
the
Hermitage
<EOS>
there
was
room
for
the
growing
moonlight
to
enter
in
at
the
windows
.
<EOS>
Their
steps
were
noiseless
on
the
thick
carpet
of
fir
-
needles
,
and
the
outward
stillness
seemed
to
heighten
their
inward
consciousness
,
as
Arthur
took
the
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
placed
it
in
Adam
's
hand
,
for
him
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
not
known
before
that
Arthur
had
furnished
the
old
Hermitage
and
made
it
a
retreat
for
himself
,
and
it
was
a
surprise
to
him
when
he
opened
the
door
to
see
a
snug
room
with
all
the
signs
of
frequent
habitation
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
loosed
Adam
's
arm
and
threw
himself
on
the
ottoman
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
see
my
hunting
-
bottle
somewhere
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
leather
case
with
a
bottle
and
glass
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
not
long
in
finding
the
case
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
very
little
brandy
in
it
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
turning
it
downwards
over
the
glass
,
as
he
held
it
before
the
window
;
"
hardly
this
little
glassful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
give
me
that
,
"
said
Arthur
,
with
the
peevishness
of
physical
depression
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
taken
some
sips
,
Adam
said
,
"
Had
n't
I
better
run
to
th
'
house
,
sir
,
and
get
some
more
brandy
?
<EOS>
I
can
be
there
and
back
pretty
soon
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
stiff
walk
home
for
you
,
if
you
do
n't
have
something
to
revive
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
go
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
say
I
'm
ill
.
<EOS>
Ask
for
my
man
Pym
,
and
tell
him
to
get
it
from
Mills
,
and
not
to
say
I
'm
at
the
Hermitage
.
<EOS>
Get
some
water
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
relieved
to
have
an
active
task
 
both
of
them
were
relieved
to
be
apart
from
each
other
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
's
swift
pace
could
not
still
the
eager
pain
of
thinking
 
of
living
again
with
concentrated
suffering
through
the
last
wretched
hour
,
and
looking
out
from
it
over
all
the
new
sad
future
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
lay
still
for
some
minutes
after
Adam
was
gone
,
but
presently
he
rose
feebly
from
the
ottoman
and
peered
about
slowly
in
the
broken
moonlight
,
seeking
something
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
short
bit
of
wax
candle
that
stood
amongst
a
confusion
of
writing
and
drawing
materials
.
<EOS>
There
was
more
searching
for
the
means
of
lighting
the
candle
,
and
when
that
was
done
,
he
went
cautiously
round
the
room
,
as
if
wishing
to
assure
himself
of
the
presence
or
absence
of
something
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
had
found
a
slight
thing
,
which
he
put
first
in
his
pocket
,
and
then
,
on
a
second
thought
,
took
out
again
and
thrust
deep
down
into
a
waste
-
paper
basket
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
woman
's
little
,
pink
,
silk
neckerchief
.
<EOS>
He
set
the
candle
on
the
table
,
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
ottoman
again
,
exhausted
with
the
effort
.
  
<EOS>
When
Adam
came
back
with
his
supplies
,
his
entrance
awoke
Arthur
from
a
doze
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
right
,
"
Arthur
said
;
"
I
'm
tremendously
in
want
of
some
brandy
-
vigour
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
've
got
a
light
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
thinking
I
'd
better
have
asked
for
a
lanthorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
the
candle
will
last
long
enough
 
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
be
up
to
walking
home
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
go
before
I
've
seen
you
<EOS>
safe
home
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
said
Adam
,
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
:
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
stay
 
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
sat
down
,
and
they
remained
opposite
to
each
other
in
uneasy
silence
,
while
Arthur
slowly
drank
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
with
visibly
renovating
effect
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
lie
in
a
more
voluntary
position
,
and
looked
as
if
he
were
less
overpowered
by
bodily
sensations
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
keenly
alive
to
these
indications
,
and
as
his
anxiety
about
Arthur
's
condition
began
to
be
allayed
,
he
felt
more
of
that
impatience
which
every
one
knows
who
has
had
his
just
indignation
suspended
by
the
physical
state
of
the
culprit
.
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
one
thing
on
his
mind
to
be
done
before
he
could
recur
to
remonstrance
<EOS>
:
it
was
to
confess
what
had
been
unjust
in
his
own
words
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
longed
all
the
more
to
make
this
confession
,
that
his
indignation
might
be
free
again
;
and
as
he
saw
the
signs
of
returning
ease
in
Arthur
,
the
words
again
and
again
came
to
his
lips
and
went
back
,
checked
by
the
thought
that
it
would
be
better
to
leave
everything
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
As
long
as
they
were
silent
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
,
and
a
foreboding
came
across
Adam
that
if
they
began
to
speak
as
though
they
remembered
the
past
 
if
they
looked
at
each
other
with
full
recognition
 
they
must
take
fire
again
.
<EOS>
So
they
sat
in
silence
till
the
bit
of
wax
candle
flickered
low
in
the
socket
,
the
silence
all
the
while
becoming
more
irksome
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
Arthur
had
just
poured
out
some
more
brandy
-
and
-
water
,
and
he
threw
one
arm
behind
his
head
and
drew
up
one
leg
in
an
attitude
of
recovered
ease
,
which
was
an
irresistible
temptation
to
Adam
to
speak
what
was
on
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
begin
to
feel
more
yourself
again
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
as
the
candle
went
out
and
they
were
half
-
hidden
from
each
other
in
the
faint
moonlight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
:
I
do
n't
feel
good
for
much
 
very
lazy
,
and
not
inclined
to
move
;
but
I
'll
go
home
when
I
've
taken
this
dose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
pause
before
Adam
said
,
"
My
temper
got
the
better
of
me
,
and
I
said
things
as
was
n't
true
.
<EOS>
I
'd
no
right
to
speak
<EOS>
as
if
you
'd
known
you
was
doing
me
an
injury
:
you
'd
no
grounds
for
knowing
it
;
I
've
always
kept
what
I
felt
for
her
as
secret
as
I
could
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
again
before
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
perhaps
I
judged
you
too
harsh
 
<EOS>
I
'm
apt
to
be
harsh
 
<EOS>
and
you
may
have
acted
out
o
'
thoughtlessness
more
than
I
should
ha
'
believed
<EOS>
was
possible
for
a
man
with
a
heart
and
a
conscience
.
<EOS>
We
're
not
all
put
together
alike
,
and
we
may
misjudge
one
another
.
<EOS>
God
knows
,
it
's
all
the
joy
I
could
have
now
,
to
think
the
best
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
wanted
to
go
home
without
saying
any
more
 
he
was
too
painfully
embarrassed
in
mind
,
as
well
as
too
weak
in
body
,
to
wish
for
any
further
explanation
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
was
a
relief
to
him
that
Adam
reopened
the
subject
in
a
way
the
least
difficult
for
him
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Arthur
was
in
the
wretched
position
of
an
open
,
generous
man
who
has
committed
an
error
which
makes
deception
seem
a
necessity
.
<EOS>
The
native
impulse
to
give
truth
in
return
for
truth
,
to
meet
trust
with
frank
confession
,
must
be
suppressed
,
and
duty
was
becoming
a
question
of
tactics
.
<EOS>
His
deed
was
reacting
upon
him
 
was
already
governing
him
tyrannously
and
forcing
him
into
a
course
that
jarred
with
his
habitual
feelings
.
<EOS>
The
only
aim
that
seemed
admissible
to
him
now
was
to
deceive
Adam
to
the
utmost
:
to
make
Adam
think
better
of
him
than
he
deserved
.
<EOS>
And
when
he
heard
the
words
of
honest
retractation
 
when
he
heard
the
sad
appeal
with
which
Adam
ended
 
he
was
obliged
to
rejoice
in
the
remains
of
ignorant
confidence
it
implied
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
answer
immediately
,
for
he
had
to
be
judicious
and
not
truthful
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
no
more
about
our
anger
,
Adam
,
"
he
said
,
at
last
,
very
languidly
,
for
the
labour
of
speech
was
unwelcome
to
him
;
"
I
forgive
your
momentary
injustice
 
<EOS>
it
was
quite
natural
,
with
the
exaggerated
notions
you
had
in
your
mind
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
none
the
worse
friends
in
future
,
I
hope
,
because
we
've
fought
.
<EOS>
You
had
the
best
of
it
,
and
that
was
as
it
should
be
,
for
I
believe
I
've
been
most
in
the
wrong
of
the
two
.
<EOS>
Come
,
let
us
shake
hands
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
held
out
his
hand
,
but
Adam
sat
still
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
like
to
say
"
No
"
to
that
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
ca
n't
shake
hands
till
it
's
clear
what
we
mean
by't
.
<EOS>
I
was
wrong
when
I
spoke
as
if
you
'd
done
me
an
injury
knowingly
,
but
I
was
n't
wrong
in
what
I
said
before
,
about
your
behaviour
t
'
Hetty
,
and
I
ca
n't
shake
hands
with
you
as
if
I
held
you
my
friend
the
same
as
ever
<EOS>
till
you
've
cleared
that
up
better
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
swallowed
his
pride
and
resentment
as
he
drew
back
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
then
said
,
as
indifferently
as
he
could
,
"
I
do
n't
know
what
you
mean
by
clearing
up
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
've
told
you
already
that
you
think
too
seriously
of
a
little
flirtation
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
are
right
in
supposing
there
is
any
danger
in
it
 
<EOS>
I
'm
going
away
on
Saturday
,
and
there
will
be
an
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
pain
it
has
given
you
,
I
'm
heartily
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
said
nothing
,
but
rose
from
his
chair
and
stood
with
his
face
towards
one
of
the
windows
,
as
if
looking
at
the
blackness
of
the
moonlit
fir
-
trees
;
but
he
was
in
reality
conscious
of
nothing
but
the
conflict
within
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
no
use
now
 
his
resolution
not
to
speak
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
must
speak
there
and
then
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
several
minutes
before
he
turned
round
and
stepped
nearer
to
Arthur
,
standing
and
looking
down
on
him
as
he
lay
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
'll
be
better
for
me
to
speak
plain
,
"
he
said
,
with
evident
effort
,
"
though
it
's
hard
work
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
sir
,
this
is
n't
a
trifle
to
me
,
whatever
it
may
be
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
'm
none
o
'
<EOS>
them
men
as
can
go
making
love
first
to
one
woman
and
then
t
'
another
,
and
do
n't
think
it
much
odds
which
of
'em
I
take
.
<EOS>
What
I
feel
for
Hetty
's
a
different
sort
o
'
love
,
such
as
I
believe
nobody
can
know
much
about
<EOS>
but
them
as
feel
it
and
God
as
has
given
it
to
'em
.
<EOS>
She
's
more
nor
everything
else
to
me
,
all
but
my
conscience
and
my
good
name
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
's
true
what
you
've
been
saying
all
along
 
and
if
it
's
only
been
trifling
and
flirting
as
you
call
it
,
as
'll
be
put
an
end
to
by
your
going
away
 
<EOS>
why
,
then
,
I
'd
wait
,
and
hope
her
heart
'
<EOS>
ud
turn
to
me
after
all
.
<EOS>
I
'm
loath
to
think
you
'd
speak
false
to
me
,
and
I
'll
believe
your
word
,
however
things
may
look
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
wronging
Hetty
more
than
me
not
to
believe
it
,
"
said
Arthur
,
almost
violently
,
starting
up
from
the
ottoman
and
moving
away
.
<EOS>
But
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
again
directly
,
saying
,
more
feebly
,
"
You
seem
to
forget
that
,
in
suspecting
me
,
you
are
casting
imputations
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
"
Adam
said
,
in
a
calmer
voice
,
as
if
he
were
half
-
relieved
 
for
he
was
too
straightforward
to
make
a
distinction
between
a
direct
falsehood
and
an
indirect
one
 
"
Nay
,
sir
,
things
do
n't
lie
level
between
Hetty
and
you
.
<EOS>
You
're
acting
with
your
eyes
open
,
whatever
you
may
do
;
but
how
do
you
know
what
's
been
in
her
mind
?
<EOS>
She
's
all
but
a
child
 
as
any
man
with
a
conscience
in
him
ought
to
feel
bound
to
take
care
on
.
<EOS>
And
whatever
you
may
think
,
I
know
you
've
disturbed
her
mind
.
<EOS>
I
know
she
's
been
fixing
her
heart
on
you
,
<EOS>
for
there
's
a
many
things
clear
to
me
now
as
I
did
n't
understand
before
.
<EOS>
But
you
seem
to
make
light
o
'
what
she
may
feel
 
<EOS>
you
do
n't
think
o
'
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
God
,
Adam
,
let
me
alone
!
"
<EOS>
Arthur
burst
out
impetuously
;
"
I
feel
it
enough
without
your
worrying
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
aware
of
his
indiscretion
as
soon
as
the
words
had
escaped
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
if
you
feel
it
,
"
Adam
rejoined
,
eagerly
;
"
if
you
feel
as
you
may
ha
'
put
false
notions
into
her
mind
,
and
made
her
believe
as
you
loved
her
,
<EOS>
when
all
the
while
you
meant
nothing
,
I
've
this
demand
to
make
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
speaking
for
myself
,
but
for
her
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
t
'
undeceive
her
before
you
go
away
.
<EOS>
Y'aren't
going
away
for
ever
,
and
if
you
leave
her
behind
with
a
notion
in
her
head
o
'
<EOS>
your
feeling
about
her
the
same
as
she
feels
about
you
<EOS>
,
she
'll
be
hankering
after
you
,
and
the
mischief
may
get
worse
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
a
smart
to
her
now
,
but
it
'll
save
her
pain
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
end
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
write
a
letter
 
you
may
trust
to
my
seeing
as
she
gets
it
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
the
truth
,
and
take
blame
to
yourself
for
behaving
as
you
'd
no
right
to
do
to
a
young
woman
as
is
n't
your
equal
.
<EOS>
I
speak
plain
,
sir
,
but
I
ca
n't
speak
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
There
's
nobody
can
take
<EOS>
care
o
'
<EOS>
Hetty
in
this
thing
but
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
what
I
think
needful
in
the
matter
,
"
said
Arthur
,
more
and
more
irritated
by
mingled
distress
and
perplexity
,
"
without
giving
promises
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
shall
take
what
measures
<EOS>
I
think
proper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Adam
,
in
an
abrupt
decided
tone
,
"
that
wo
n't
do
.
<EOS>
I
must
know
what
ground
<EOS>
I
'm
treading
on
.
<EOS>
I
must
be
safe
as
you
've
put
an
end
to
what
ought
never
to
ha
'
been
begun
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
forget
what
's
owing
to
you
as
a
gentleman
,
but
in
this
thing
we
're
man
and
man
,
and
I
ca
n't
give
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
Then
Arthur
said
,
"
I
'll
see
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
can
bear
no
more
now
;
I
'm
ill
.
"
<EOS>
He
rose
as
he
spoke
,
and
reached
his
cap
,
as
if
intending
to
go
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
see
her
again
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
exclaimed
,
with
a
flash
of
recurring
anger
and
suspicion
,
moving
towards
the
door
and
placing
his
back
against
it
.
"
<EOS>
Either
tell
me
she
can
never
be
my
wife
 
<EOS>
tell
me
you
've
been
lying
 
or
else
<EOS>
promise
me
what
I
've
said
.
<EOS>
"
  
Adam
,
uttering
this
alternative
,
stood
like
a
terrible
fate
before
Arthur
,
who
had
moved
forward
a
step
or
two
,
and
now
stopped
,
faint
,
shaken
,
sick
in
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
long
to
both
of
them
 
that
inward
struggle
of
Arthur
's
 
before
he
said
,
feebly
,
"
I
promise
;
let
me
go
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
moved
away
from
the
door
and
opened
it
,
but
when
Arthur
reached
the
step
,
he
stopped
again
and
leaned
against
the
door
-
post
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
not
well
enough
to
walk
alone
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
arm
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
made
no
answer
,
and
presently
walked
on
,
Adam
following
.
<EOS>
But
,
after
a
few
steps
,
he
stood
still
again
,
and
said
,
coldly
,
"
I
believe
I
must
trouble
you
.
<EOS>
It
's
getting
late
now
,
and
there
may
be
an
alarm
set
up
about
me
at
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
gave
his
arm
,
and
they
walked
on
without
uttering
a
word
,
till
they
came
where
the
basket
and
the
tools
lay
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
pick
up
the
tools
,
sir
,
"
Adam
said
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
my
brother
's
.
<EOS>
I
doubt
they
'll
be
rusted
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
please
to
wait
a
minute
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
stood
still
without
speaking
,
and
no
other
word
passed
between
them
till
they
were
at
the
side
entrance
,
where
he
hoped
to
get
in
without
being
seen
by
any
one
.
<EOS>
He
said
then
,
"
Thank
you
;
<EOS>
I
need
n't
trouble
you
any
further
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
time
will
it
be
conven'ent
for
me
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
,
sir
?
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
send
me
word
that
you
're
here
at
five
o'clock
,
"
said
Arthur
;
"
not
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Good
-
night
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
But
he
heard
no
reply
;
Arthur
had
turned
into
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
The
Next
Morning
  
ARTHUR
did
not
pass
a
sleepless
night
;
he
slept
long
and
well
.
<EOS>
For
sleep
comes
to
the
perplexed
 
if
the
perplexed
are
only
weary
enough
.
<EOS>
But
at
seven
he
rang
his
bell
and
astonished
Pym
by
declaring
he
was
going
to
get
up
,
and
must
have
breakfast
brought
to
him
at
eight
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
see
that
my
mare
is
saddled
at
half
-
past
eight
,
and
tell
my
grandfather
when
he
's
down
that
I
'm
better
this
morning
and
am
gone
for
a
ride
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
been
awake
an
hour
,
and
could
rest
in
bed
no
longer
.
<EOS>
In
bed
our
yesterdays
are
too
oppressive
:
if
a
man
can
only
get
up
,
though
it
be
but
to
whistle
or
to
smoke
,
he
has
a
present
which
offers
some
resistance
to
the
past
 
sensations
which
assert
themselves
against
tyrannous
memories
.
<EOS>
And
if
there
were
such
a
thing
as
taking
averages
of
feeling
,
it
would
certainly
be
found
that
in
the
hunting
and
shooting
seasons
regret
,
self
-
reproach
,
and
mortified
pride
weigh
lighter
on
country
gentlemen
than
in
late
spring
and
summer
.
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
that
he
should
be
more
of
a
man
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
Even
the
presence
of
Pym
,
waiting
on
him
with
the
usual
deference
,
was
a
reassurance
to
him
after
the
scenes
of
yesterday
.
<EOS>
For
,
with
Arthur
's
sensitiveness
to
opinion
,
the
loss
of
Adam
's
respect
was
a
shock
to
his
self
-
contentment
which
suffused
his
imagination
with
the
sense
that
he
had
sunk
in
all
eyes
 
as
a
sudden
shock
of
fear
from
some
real
peril
<EOS>
makes
a
nervous
woman
afraid
even
to
step
,
because
all
her
perceptions
are
suffused
with
a
sense
of
danger
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
's
,
as
you
know
,
was
a
loving
nature
.
<EOS>
Deeds
of
kindness
were
as
easy
to
him
as
a
bad
habit
:
they
were
the
common
issue
of
his
weaknesses
and
good
qualities
,
of
his
egoism
and
his
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
did
n't
like
to
witness
pain
,
and
he
liked
to
have
grateful
eyes
beaming
on
him
as
the
giver
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
a
lad
of
seven
,
he
one
day
kicked
down
an
old
gardener
's
pitcher
of
broth
,
from
no
motive
but
a
kicking
impulse
,
not
reflecting
that
it
was
the
old
man
's
dinner
;
but
on
learning
that
sad
fact
,
he
took
his
favourite
pencil
-
case
and
a
silver
-
hafted
knife
out
of
his
pocket
and
offered
them
as
compensation
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
the
same
Arthur
ever
since
,
trying
to
make
all
offences
forgotten
in
benefits
.
<EOS>
If
there
were
any
bitterness
in
his
nature
,
it
could
only
show
itself
against
the
man
who
refused
to
be
conciliated
by
him
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
the
time
was
come
for
some
of
that
bitterness
to
rise
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
moment
,
Arthur
had
felt
pure
distress
and
self
-
reproach
at
discovering
that
Adam
's
happiness
was
involved
in
his
relation
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
If
there
had
been
a
possibility
of
making
Adam
tenfold
amends
 
if
deeds
of
gift
,
or
any
other
deeds
,
could
have
restored
Adam
's
contentment
and
regard
for
him
as
a
benefactor
,
Arthur
would
not
only
have
executed
them
without
hesitation
,
but
would
have
felt
bound
all
the
more
closely
to
Adam
,
and
would
never
have
been
weary
of
making
retribution
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
could
receive
no
amends
;
his
suffering
could
not
be
cancelled
;
his
respect
and
affection
could
not
be
recovered
by
any
prompt
deeds
of
atonement
.
<EOS>
He
stood
like
an
immovable
obstacle
against
which
no
pressure
could
avail
;
an
embodiment
of
what
Arthur
most
shrank
from
believing
in
 
the
irrevocableness
of
his
own
wrongdoing
.
<EOS>
The
words
of
scorn
,
the
refusal
to
shake
hands
,
the
mastery
asserted
over
him
in
their
last
conversation
in
the
Hermitage
 
above
all
,
the
sense
of
having
been
knocked
down
,
to
which
a
man
does
not
very
well
reconcile
himself
,
even
under
the
most
heroic
circumstances
 
pressed
on
him
with
a
galling
pain
which
was
stronger
than
compunction
.
<EOS>
Arthur
would
so
gladly
have
persuaded
himself
that
he
had
done
no
harm
!
<EOS>
And
if
no
one
had
told
him
the
contrary
,
he
could
have
persuaded
himself
so
much
better
.
<EOS>
Nemesis
can
seldom
forge
a
sword
for
herself
out
of
our
consciences
 
out
of
the
suffering
we
feel
in
the
suffering
we
may
have
caused
:
there
is
rarely
metal
enough
there
to
make
an
effective
weapon
.
<EOS>
Our
moral
sense
learns
the
manners
of
good
society
and
smiles
when
others
smile
,
but
when
some
rude
person
gives
rough
names
to
our
actions
,
she
is
apt
to
take
part
against
us
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
was
with
Arthur
:
<EOS>
Adam
's
judgment
of
him
,
Adam
's
grating
words
,
disturbed
his
self
-
soothing
arguments
.
  
<EOS>
Not
that
Arthur
had
been
at
ease
before
Adam
's
discovery
.
<EOS>
Struggles
and
resolves
had
transformed
themselves
into
compunction
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
He
was
distressed
for
Hetty
's
sake
,
and
distressed
for
his
own
,
that
he
must
leave
her
behind
.
<EOS>
He
had
always
,
both
in
making
and
breaking
resolutions
,
looked
beyond
his
passion
and
seen
that
it
must
speedily
end
in
separation
;
but
his
nature
was
too
ardent
and
tender
for
him
not
to
suffer
at
this
parting
;
and
on
Hetty
's
account
he
was
filled
with
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
He
had
found
out
the
dream
in
which
she
was
living
 
<EOS>
that
she
was
to
be
a
lady
in
silks
and
satins
 
<EOS>
and
when
he
had
first
talked
to
her
about
his
going
away
,
she
had
asked
him
tremblingly
to
let
her
go
with
him
and
be
married
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
painful
knowledge
of
this
which
had
given
the
most
exasperating
sting
to
Adam
's
reproaches
.
<EOS>
He
had
said
no
word
with
the
purpose
of
deceiving
her
 
<EOS>
her
vision
was
all
spun
by
her
own
childish
fancy
 
<EOS>
but
he
was
obliged
to
confess
to
himself
that
it
was
spun
half
out
of
his
own
actions
.
<EOS>
And
to
increase
the
mischief
,
on
this
last
evening
he
had
not
dared
to
hint
the
truth
to
Hetty
;
he
had
been
obliged
to
soothe
her
with
tender
,
hopeful
words
,
lest
he
should
throw
her
into
violent
distress
.
<EOS>
He
felt
the
situation
acutely
,
felt
the
sorrow
of
the
dear
thing
in
the
present
,
and
thought
with
a
darker
anxiety
of
the
tenacity
which
her
feelings
might
have
in
the
future
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
one
sharp
point
which
pressed
against
him
;
every
other
he
could
evade
by
hopeful
self
-
persuasion
.
<EOS>
The
whole
thing
had
been
secret
;
the
Poysers
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
suspicion
.
<EOS>
No
one
,
except
Adam
,
knew
anything
of
what
had
passed
 
<EOS>
no
one
else
was
likely
to
know
;
for
Arthur
had
impressed
on
Hetty
that
it
would
be
fatal
to
betray
,
by
word
or
look
,
that
there
had
been
the
least
intimacy
between
them
;
and
Adam
,
who
knew
half
their
secret
,
would
rather
help
them
to
keep
it
than
betray
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
unfortunate
business
altogether
,
but
there
was
no
use
in
making
it
worse
than
it
was
by
imaginary
exaggerations
and
forebodings
of
evil
that
might
never
come
.
<EOS>
The
temporary
sadness
for
Hetty
was
the
worst
consequence
;
he
resolutely
turned
away
his
eyes
from
any
bad
consequence
that
was
not
demonstrably
inevitable
.
<EOS>
But
 
but
Hetty
might
have
had
the
trouble
in
some
other
way
if
not
in
this
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
hereafter
he
might
be
able
to
do
a
great
deal
for
her
and
make
up
to
her
for
all
the
tears
she
would
shed
about
him
.
<EOS>
She
would
owe
the
advantage
of
his
care
for
her
in
future
years
to
the
sorrow
she
had
incurred
now
.
<EOS>
So
good
comes
out
of
evil
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
beautiful
arrangement
of
things
!
  
<EOS>
Are
you
inclined
to
ask
whether
this
can
be
the
same
Arthur
who
,
two
months
ago
,
had
that
freshness
of
feeling
,
that
delicate
honour
which
shrinks
from
wounding
even
a
sentiment
,
and
does
not
contemplate
any
more
positive
offence
as
possible
for
it
?
 
<EOS>
who
thought
that
his
own
self
-
respect
was
a
higher
tribunal
than
any
external
opinion
?
<EOS>
The
same
,
I
assure
you
,
only
under
different
conditions
.
<EOS>
Our
deeds
determine
us
,
as
much
as
we
determine
our
deeds
,
and
until
we
know
what
has
been
or
will
be
the
peculiar
combination
of
outward
with
inward
facts
,
which
constitutes
a
man
's
critical
actions
,
it
will
be
better
not
to
think
ourselves
wise
about
his
character
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
terrible
coercion
in
our
deeds
,
which
may
first
turn
the
honest
man
into
a
deceiver
and
then
reconcile
him
to
the
change
,
for
this
reason
 
that
the
second
wrong
presents
itself
to
him
in
the
guise
of
the
only
practicable
right
.
<EOS>
The
action
which
before
commission
has
been
seen
with
that
blended
common
sense
and
fresh
untarnished
feeling
which
is
the
healthy
eye
of
the
soul
,
is
looked
at
afterwards
with
the
lens
of
apologetic
ingenuity
,
through
which
all
things
that
men
call
beautiful
and
ugly
are
seen
to
be
made
up
of
textures
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
Europe
adjusts
itself
to
a
_
fait
accompli
_
,
and
so
does
an
individual
character
 
until
the
placid
adjustment
is
disturbed
by
a
convulsive
retribution
.
  
<EOS>
No
man
can
escape
this
vitiating
effect
of
an
offence
against
his
own
sentiment
of
right
,
and
the
effect
was
the
stronger
in
Arthur
because
of
that
very
need
of
self
-
respect
which
,
while
his
conscience
was
still
at
ease
,
was
one
of
his
best
safeguards
.
<EOS>
Self
-
accusation
was
too
painful
to
him
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
face
it
.
<EOS>
He
must
persuade
himself
that
he
had
not
been
very
much
to
blame
;
he
began
even
to
pity
himself
for
the
necessity
he
was
under
of
deceiving
Adam
 
<EOS>
it
was
a
course
so
opposed
to
the
honesty
of
his
own
nature
.
<EOS>
But
then
,
it
was
the
only
right
thing
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
whatever
had
been
amiss
in
him
,
he
was
miserable
enough
in
consequence
:
miserable
about
Hetty
;
miserable
about
this
letter
that
he
had
promised
to
write
,
and
that
seemed
at
one
moment
to
be
a
gross
barbarity
,
at
another
perhaps
the
greatest
kindness
he
could
do
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
across
all
this
reflection
would
dart
every
now
<EOS>
and
then
a
sudden
impulse
of
passionate
defiance
towards
all
consequences
.
<EOS>
He
would
carry
Hetty
away
,
and
all
other
considerations
might
go
to
....
  
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
the
four
walls
of
his
room
made
an
intolerable
prison
to
him
;
they
seemed
to
hem
in
and
press
down
upon
him
all
the
crowd
of
contradictory
thoughts
and
conflicting
feelings
,
some
of
which
would
fly
away
in
the
open
air
.
<EOS>
He
had
only
an
hour
or
two
to
make
up
his
mind
in
,
and
he
must
get
clear
and
calm
.
<EOS>
Once
on
Meg
's
back
,
in
the
fresh
air
of
that
fine
morning
,
he
should
be
more
master
of
the
situation
.
  
<EOS>
The
pretty
creature
arched
her
bay
neck
in
the
sunshine
,
and
pawed
the
gravel
,
and
trembled
with
pleasure
when
her
master
stroked
her
nose
,
and
patted
her
,
and
talked
to
her
even
in
a
more
caressing
tone
than
usual
.
<EOS>
He
loved
her
the
better
because
she
knew
nothing
of
his
secrets
.
<EOS>
But
Meg
was
quite
as
well
acquainted
with
her
master
's
mental
state
as
many
others
of
her
sex
with
the
mental
condition
of
the
nice
young
gentlemen
towards
whom
their
hearts
are
in
a
state
of
fluttering
expectation
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
cantered
for
five
miles
beyond
the
Chase
,
till
he
was
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
where
there
were
no
hedges
or
trees
to
hem
in
the
road
.
<EOS>
Then
he
threw
the
bridle
on
Meg
's
neck
and
prepared
to
make
up
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
knew
that
their
meeting
yesterday
must
be
the
last
before
Arthur
went
away
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
possibility
of
their
contriving
another
without
exciting
suspicion
 
<EOS>
and
she
was
like
a
frightened
child
,
unable
to
think
of
anything
,
only
able
to
cry
at
the
mention
of
parting
,
and
then
put
her
face
up
to
have
the
tears
kissed
away
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
but
comfort
her
,
and
lull
her
into
dreaming
on
.
<EOS>
A
letter
would
be
a
dreadfully
abrupt
way
of
awakening
her
!
<EOS>
Yet
there
was
truth
in
what
Adam
said
 
that
it
would
save
her
from
a
lengthened
delusion
,
which
might
be
worse
than
a
sharp
immediate
pain
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
the
only
way
of
satisfying
Adam
,
who
must
be
satisfied
,
for
more
reasons
than
one
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
have
seen
her
again
!
<EOS>
But
that
was
impossible
;
there
was
such
a
thorny
hedge
of
hindrances
between
them
,
and
an
imprudence
would
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
if
he
COULD
see
her
again
,
what
good
would
it
do
?
<EOS>
Only
cause
him
to
suffer
more
from
the
sight
of
her
distress
and
the
remembrance
of
it
.
<EOS>
Away
from
him
she
was
surrounded
by
all
the
motives
to
self
-
control
.
  
<EOS>
A
sudden
dread
here
fell
like
a
shadow
across
his
imagination
 
<EOS>
the
dread
lest
she
should
do
something
violent
in
her
grief
;
and
close
upon
that
dread
came
another
,
which
deepened
the
shadow
.
<EOS>
But
he
shook
them
off
with
the
force
of
youth
and
hope
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
ground
for
painting
the
future
in
that
dark
way
?
<EOS>
It
was
just
as
likely
to
be
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
Arthur
told
himself
he
did
not
deserve
that
things
should
turn
out
badly
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
meant
beforehand
to
do
anything
his
conscience
disapproved
;
he
had
been
led
on
by
circumstances
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sort
of
implicit
confidence
in
him
that
he
was
really
such
a
good
fellow
at
bottom
,
Providence
would
not
treat
him
harshly
.
  
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
he
could
n't
help
what
would
come
now
:
all
he
could
do
was
to
take
what
seemed
the
best
course
at
the
present
moment
.
<EOS>
And
he
persuaded
himself
that
that
course
was
to
make
the
way
open
between
Adam
and
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
might
really
turn
to
Adam
,
as
he
said
,
after
a
while
;
and
in
that
case
there
would
have
been
no
great
harm
done
,
since
it
was
still
Adam
's
ardent
wish
to
make
her
his
wife
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
Adam
was
deceived
 
deceived
in
a
way
that
Arthur
would
have
resented
as
a
deep
wrong
if
it
had
been
practised
on
himself
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
reflection
that
marred
the
consoling
prospect
.
<EOS>
Arthur
's
cheeks
even
burned
in
mingled
shame
and
irritation
at
the
thought
.
<EOS>
But
what
could
a
man
do
in
such
a
dilemma
?
<EOS>
He
was
bound
in
honour
to
say
no
word
that
could
injure
Hetty
:
his
first
duty
was
to
guard
her
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
have
told
or
acted
a
lie
on
his
own
account
.
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
What
a
miserable
fool
he
was
to
have
brought
himself
into
such
a
dilemma
;
and
yet
,
if
ever
a
man
had
excuses
,
he
had
.
<EOS>
(
Pity
that
consequences
are
determined
not
by
excuses
but
by
actions
!
)
  
<EOS>
Well
,
the
letter
must
be
written
;
it
was
the
only
means
that
promised
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
tears
came
into
Arthur
's
eyes
as
he
thought
of
Hetty
reading
it
;
but
it
would
be
almost
as
hard
for
him
to
write
it
;
he
was
not
doing
anything
easy
to
himself
;
and
this
last
thought
helped
him
to
arrive
at
a
conclusion
.
<EOS>
He
could
never
deliberately
have
taken
a
step
which
inflicted
pain
on
another
and
left
himself
at
ease
.
<EOS>
Even
a
movement
of
jealousy
at
the
thought
of
giving
up
Hetty
to
Adam
went
to
convince
him
that
he
was
making
a
sacrifice
.
  
<EOS>
When
once
he
had
come
to
this
conclusion
,
he
turned
Meg
round
and
set
off
home
again
in
a
canter
.
<EOS>
The
letter
should
be
written
the
first
thing
,
and
the
rest
of
the
day
would
be
filled
up
with
other
business
:
he
should
have
no
time
to
look
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Happily
,
Irwine
and
Gawaine
were
coming
to
dinner
,
and
by
twelve
o'clock
the
next
day
he
should
have
left
the
Chase
miles
behind
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
some
security
in
this
constant
occupation
against
an
uncontrollable
impulse
seizing
him
to
rush
to
Hetty
and
thrust
into
her
hand
some
mad
proposition
that
would
undo
everything
.
<EOS>
Faster
and
faster
went
the
sensitive
Meg
,
at
every
slight
sign
from
her
rider
,
till
the
canter
had
passed
into
a
swift
gallop
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
said
th
'
young
mester
war
took
ill
last
night
,
"
said
sour
old
John
,
the
groom
,
at
dinner
-
time
in
the
servants
'
hall
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
ridin
'
fit
to
split
the
mare
<EOS>
i
'
two
this
forenoon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
happen
<EOS>
one
o
'
the
symptims
,
John
,
"
said
the
facetious
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
wish
he
war
let
blood
for
'
t
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
,
"
said
John
,
grimly
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
been
early
at
the
Chase
to
know
how
Arthur
was
,
and
had
been
relieved
from
all
anxiety
about
the
effects
of
his
blow
by
learning
that
he
was
gone
out
for
a
ride
.
<EOS>
At
five
o'clock
he
was
punctually
there
again
,
and
sent
up
word
of
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
Pym
came
down
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
and
gave
it
to
Adam
,
saying
that
the
captain
was
too
busy
to
see
him
,
and
had
written
everything
he
had
to
say
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
directed
to
Adam
,
but
he
went
out
of
doors
again
before
opening
it
.
<EOS>
It
contained
a
sealed
enclosure
directed
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
On
the
inside
of
the
cover
Adam
read
:
   
"
In
the
enclosed
letter
I
have
written
everything
you
wish
.
<EOS>
I
leave
it
to
you
to
decide
whether
you
will
be
doing
best
to
deliver
it
to
Hetty
or
to
return
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ask
yourself
once
more
whether
you
are
not
taking
a
measure
which
may
pain
her
more
than
mere
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
for
our
seeing
each
other
again
now
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
with
better
feelings
some
months
hence
.
  
<EOS>
"
A.D.
"
   
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
's
i
<EOS>
'
th
'
right
on
'
t
not
to
see
me
,
"
thought
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
meeting
to
say
more
hard
words
,
and
it
's
no
use
meeting
to
shake
hands
and
say
we
're
friends
again
.
<EOS>
We
're
not
friends
,
an
'
it
's
better
not
to
pretend
it
.
<EOS>
I
know
forgiveness
is
a
man
's
duty
,
but
,
<EOS>
to
my
thinking
,
that
can
only
mean
as
you
're
to
give
up
all
thoughts
o
'
taking
revenge
:
it
can
never
mean
as
you
're
t
'
have
your
old
feelings
back
again
,
for
that
's
not
possible
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
the
same
man
to
me
,
and
I
ca
n't
feel
the
same
towards
him
.
<EOS>
God
help
me
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
feel
the
same
towards
anybody
:
I
seem
as
if
I
'd
been
measuring
my
work
from
a
false
line
,
and
had
got
it
all
to
measure
over
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
question
about
delivering
the
letter
to
Hetty
soon
absorbed
Adam
's
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Arthur
had
procured
some
relief
to
himself
by
throwing
the
decision
on
Adam
with
a
warning
;
and
Adam
,
who
was
not
given
to
hesitation
,
hesitated
here
.
<EOS>
He
determined
to
feel
his
way
 
to
ascertain
as
well
as
he
could
what
was
Hetty
's
state
of
mind
before
he
decided
on
delivering
the
letter
.
    
<EOS>
The
Delivery
of
the
Letter
  
<EOS>
THE
next
Sunday
Adam
joined
the
Poysers
on
their
way
out
of
church
,
hoping
for
an
invitation
to
go
home
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
letter
in
his
pocket
,
and
was
anxious
to
have
an
opportunity
of
talking
to
Hetty
alone
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
face
at
church
,
for
she
had
changed
her
seat
,
and
when
he
came
up
to
her
to
shake
hands
,
her
manner
was
doubtful
and
constrained
.
<EOS>
He
expected
this
,
for
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
met
him
since
she
had
been
aware
that
he
had
seen
her
with
Arthur
in
the
Grove
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
you
'll
go
on
with
us
,
Adam
,
"
Mr.
Poyser
said
when
they
reached
the
turning
;
and
as
soon
as
they
were
in
the
fields
Adam
ventured
to
offer
his
arm
to
Hetty
.
<EOS>
The
children
soon
gave
them
an
opportunity
of
lingering
behind
a
little
,
and
then
Adam
said
:
  
"
Will
you
contrive
for
me
to
walk
out
in
the
garden
a
bit
with
you
this
evening
,
if
it
keeps
fine
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
I
've
something
partic'lar
to
talk
to
you
about
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
said
,
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
really
as
anxious
as
Adam
was
that
she
should
have
some
private
talk
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
what
he
thought
of
her
and
Arthur
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
seen
them
kissing
,
she
knew
,
but
she
had
no
conception
of
the
scene
that
had
taken
place
between
Arthur
and
Adam
.
<EOS>
Her
first
feeling
had
been
that
Adam
would
be
very
angry
with
her
,
and
perhaps
would
tell
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
but
it
never
entered
her
mind
that
he
would
dare
to
say
anything
to
Captain
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
relief
to
her
that
he
behaved
so
kindly
to
her
to
-
day
,
and
wanted
to
speak
to
her
alone
,
for
she
had
trembled
when
she
found
he
was
going
home
with
them
lest
he
should
mean
"
to
tell
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
now
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
by
herself
,
she
should
learn
what
he
thought
and
what
he
meant
to
do
.
<EOS>
She
felt
a
certain
confidence
that
she
could
persuade
him
not
to
do
anything
she
did
not
want
him
to
do
;
she
could
perhaps
even
make
him
believe
that
she
did
n't
care
for
Arthur
;
and
as
long
as
Adam
thought
there
was
any
hope
of
her
having
him
,
he
would
do
just
what
she
liked
,
she
knew
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
she
MUST
go
on
seeming
to
encourage
Adam
,
lest
her
uncle
and
aunt
should
be
angry
and
suspect
her
of
having
some
secret
lover
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
's
little
brain
was
busy
with
this
combination
as
she
hung
on
Adam
's
arm
and
said
"
yes
"
or
"
no
"
to
some
slight
observations
of
his
about
the
many
hawthorn
-
berries
there
would
be
for
the
birds
this
next
winter
,
and
the
low
-
hanging
clouds
that
would
hardly
hold
up
till
morning
.
<EOS>
And
when
they
rejoined
her
aunt
and
uncle
,
she
could
pursue
her
thoughts
without
interruption
,
for
Mr.
Poyser
held
that
though
a
young
man
might
like
to
have
the
woman
he
was
courting
on
his
arm
,
he
would
nevertheless
be
glad
of
a
little
reasonable
talk
about
business
the
while
;
and
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
was
curious
to
hear
the
most
recent
news
about
the
Chase
Farm
.
<EOS>
So
,
through
the
rest
of
the
walk
,
he
claimed
Adam
's
conversation
for
himself
,
and
Hetty
laid
her
small
plots
and
imagined
her
little
scenes
of
cunning
blandishment
,
as
she
walked
along
by
the
hedgerows
on
honest
Adam
's
arm
,
quite
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
an
elegantly
clad
coquette
alone
in
her
boudoir
.
<EOS>
For
if
a
country
beauty
in
clumsy
shoes
be
only
shallow
-
hearted
enough
,
it
is
astonishing
how
closely
her
mental
processes
may
resemble
those
of
a
lady
in
society
and
crinoline
,
who
applies
her
refined
intellect
to
the
problem
of
committing
indiscretions
without
compromising
herself
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
resemblance
was
not
much
the
less
because
Hetty
felt
very
unhappy
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
The
parting
with
Arthur
was
a
double
pain
to
her
 
mingling
with
the
tumult
of
passion
and
vanity
<EOS>
there
was
a
dim
undefined
fear
that
the
future
might
shape
itself
in
some
way
quite
unlike
her
dream
.
<EOS>
She
clung
to
the
comforting
hopeful
words
Arthur
had
uttered
in
their
last
meeting
 
<EOS>
"
I
shall
come
again
at
Christmas
,
and
then
we
will
see
what
can
be
done
.
"
<EOS>
She
clung
to
the
belief
that
he
was
so
fond
of
her
,
he
would
never
be
happy
without
her
;
and
she
still
hugged
her
secret
 
that
a
great
gentleman
loved
her
 
with
gratified
pride
,
as
a
superiority
over
all
the
girls
she
knew
.
<EOS>
But
the
uncertainty
of
the
future
,
the
possibilities
to
which
she
could
give
no
shape
,
began
to
press
upon
her
like
the
invisible
weight
of
air
;
she
was
alone
on
her
little
island
of
dreams
,
and
all
around
her
<EOS>
was
the
dark
unknown
water
where
Arthur
was
gone
.
<EOS>
She
could
gather
no
elation
of
spirits
now
by
looking
forward
,
but
only
by
looking
backward
to
build
confidence
on
past
words
and
caresses
.
<EOS>
But
occasionally
,
since
Thursday
evening
,
her
dim
anxieties
had
been
almost
lost
behind
the
more
definite
fear
that
Adam
might
betray
what
he
knew
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
and
his
sudden
proposition
to
talk
with
her
alone
had
set
her
thoughts
to
work
in
a
new
way
.
<EOS>
She
was
eager
not
to
lose
this
evening
's
opportunity
;
and
after
tea
,
when
the
boys
were
going
into
the
garden
and
Totty
begged
to
go
with
them
,
Hetty
said
,
with
an
alacrity
that
surprised
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
I
'll
go
with
her
,
Aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
did
not
seem
at
all
surprising
that
Adam
said
he
would
go
too
,
and
soon
he
and
Hetty
were
left
alone
together
on
the
walk
by
the
filbert
-
trees
,
while
the
boys
were
busy
elsewhere
gathering
the
large
unripe
nuts
to
play
at
"
cob
-
nut
"
with
,
and
Totty
was
watching
them
with
a
puppylike
air
of
contemplation
.
<EOS>
It
was
but
a
short
time
 
hardly
two
months
 
since
Adam
had
had
his
mind
filled
with
delicious
hopes
as
he
stood
by
Hetty
's
side
in
this
garden
.
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
that
scene
had
often
been
with
him
since
Thursday
evening
:
the
sunlight
through
the
apple
-
tree
boughs
,
the
red
bunches
,
Hetty
's
sweet
blush
.
<EOS>
It
came
importunately
now
,
on
this
sad
evening
,
with
the
low
-
hanging
clouds
,
but
he
tried
to
suppress
it
,
lest
some
emotion
should
impel
him
to
say
more
than
was
needful
for
Hetty
's
sake
.
  
<EOS>
"
After
what
I
saw
on
Thursday
night
,
Hetty
,
"
he
began
,
"
you
wo
n't
think
me
making
too
free
in
what
I
'm
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
If
you
was
being
courted
by
any
man
as
'
ud
make
you
his
wife
,
and
I
'd
known
you
was
fond
of
him
and
meant
to
have
him
,
I
should
have
no
right
to
speak
a
word
to
you
about
it
;
but
when
I
see
you
're
being
made
love
to
by
a
gentleman
as
can
never
marry
you
,
and
doesna
think
o
'
marrying
you
,
I
feel
bound
t
'
interfere
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
speak
about
it
to
them
as
are
i
'
the
place
<EOS>
o
'
your
parents
,
for
that
might
bring
worse
trouble
than
's
needful
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
's
words
relieved
one
of
Hetty
's
fears
,
but
they
also
carried
a
meaning
which
sickened
her
with
a
strengthened
foreboding
.
<EOS>
She
was
pale
and
trembling
,
and
yet
she
would
have
angrily
contradicted
Adam
,
if
she
had
dared
to
betray
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
silent
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
so
young
,
you
know
,
Hetty
,
"
he
went
on
,
almost
tenderly
,
"
and
y
'
have
n't
seen
much
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
what
goes
on
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
's
right
for
me
to
do
what
I
can
to
save
you
from
getting
into
trouble
for
want
o
'
<EOS>
your
knowing
where
you
're
being
led
to
.
<EOS>
If
anybody
besides
me
knew
what
I
know
about
your
meeting
a
gentleman
and
having
fine
presents
from
him
,
they
'd
speak
light
on
you
,
and
you
'd
lose
your
character
.
<EOS>
And
besides
that
,
you
'll
have
to
suffer
in
your
feelings
,
wi
'
giving
your
love
to
a
man
as
can
never
marry
you
,
so
as
he
might
take
care
of
you
all
your
life
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
paused
and
looked
at
Hetty
,
who
was
plucking
the
leaves
from
the
filbert
-
trees
and
tearing
them
up
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Her
little
plans
and
preconcerted
speeches
had
all
forsaken
her
,
like
an
ill
-
learnt
lesson
,
under
the
terrible
agitation
produced
by
Adam
's
words
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
cruel
force
in
their
calm
certainty
which
threatened
to
grapple
and
crush
her
flimsy
hopes
and
fancies
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
resist
them
 
she
wanted
to
throw
them
off
with
angry
contradiction
 
<EOS>
but
the
determination
to
conceal
what
she
felt
still
governed
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
more
than
a
blind
prompting
now
,
for
she
was
unable
to
calculate
the
effect
of
her
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
no
right
to
say
as
I
love
him
,
"
she
said
,
faintly
,
but
impetuously
,
plucking
another
rough
leaf
and
tearing
it
up
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
beautiful
in
her
paleness
and
agitation
,
with
her
dark
childish
eyes
dilated
and
her
breath
shorter
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
yearned
over
her
as
he
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
if
he
could
but
comfort
her
,
and
soothe
her
,
and
save
her
from
this
pain
;
if
he
had
but
<EOS>
some
sort
of
strength
that
would
enable
him
to
rescue
her
poor
troubled
mind
,
as
he
would
have
rescued
her
body
in
the
face
of
all
danger
!
  
<EOS>
"
I
doubt
it
must
be
so
,
Hetty
,
"
he
said
,
tenderly
;
"
for
I
canna
believe
you
'd
let
any
man
kiss
you
by
yourselves
,
and
give
you
a
gold
box
with
his
hair
,
and
go
a
-
walking
i
'
the
Grove
to
meet
him
,
if
you
didna
love
him
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
blaming
you
,
for
I
know
it
'
ud
begin
by
little
and
little
,
till
at
last
you
'd
not
be
able
to
throw
it
off
.
<EOS>
It
's
him
I
blame
for
stealing
your
love
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
that
way
,
when
he
knew
he
could
never
make
you
the
right
amends
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
trifling
with
you
,
and
making
a
plaything
of
you
,
and
caring
nothing
about
you
as
a
man
ought
to
care
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
he
does
care
for
me
;
I
know
better
nor
you
,
"
Hetty
burst
out
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
forgotten
but
the
pain
and
anger
she
felt
at
Adam
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Hetty
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
if
he
'd
cared
for
you
rightly
,
he
'd
never
ha
'
behaved
so
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
himself
he
meant
nothing
by
his
kissing
and
presents
,
and
he
wanted
to
make
me
believe
as
you
thought
light
of
'em
too
.
<EOS>
But
I
know
better
nor
that
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
as
you
've
been
trusting
to
his
loving
you
<EOS>
well
enough
to
marry
you
,
for
all
he
's
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
And
that
's
why
I
must
speak
to
you
about
it
,
Hetty
,
for
fear
you
should
be
deceiving
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
's
never
entered
his
head
the
thought
o
'
marrying
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
?
<EOS>
How
durst
you
say
so
?
<EOS>
"
said
Hetty
,
pausing
in
her
walk
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
The
terrible
decision
of
Adam
's
tone
shook
her
with
fear
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
presence
of
mind
left
for
the
reflection
that
Arthur
would
have
his
reasons
for
not
telling
the
truth
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
Her
words
and
look
were
enough
to
determine
Adam
:
he
must
give
her
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
you
ca
n't
believe
me
,
Hetty
,
because
you
think
too
well
of
him
 
because
you
think
he
loves
you
better
than
he
does
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
got
a
letter
<EOS>
i
'
my
pocket
,
as
he
wrote
himself
for
me
to
give
you
.
<EOS>
I
've
not
read
the
letter
,
but
he
says
he
's
told
you
the
truth
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
give
you
the
letter
,
consider
,
Hetty
,
and
do
n't
let
it
take
too
much
hold
on
you
.
<EOS>
It
wouldna
ha
'
been
good
for
you
if
he
'd
wanted
to
do
such
a
mad
thing
as
marry
you
:
<EOS>
it
'
ud
ha
'
led
to
no
happiness
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
said
nothing
;
she
felt
a
revival
of
hope
at
the
mention
of
a
letter
which
Adam
had
not
read
.
<EOS>
There
would
be
something
quite
different
in
it
from
what
he
thought
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
took
out
the
letter
,
but
he
held
it
in
his
hand
still
,
while
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
tender
entreaty
,
"
Do
n't
you
bear
me
ill
will
,
Hetty
,
because
I
'm
the
means
o
'
bringing
you
this
pain
.
<EOS>
God
knows
I
'd
ha
'
borne
a
good
deal
worse
for
the
sake
<EOS>
o
'
sparing
it
you
.
<EOS>
And
think
 
there
's
nobody
<EOS>
but
me
knows
about
this
,
and
I
'll
take
care
of
you
as
if
I
was
your
brother
.
<EOS>
You
're
the
same
as
ever
to
me
,
for
I
do
n't
believe
you
've
done
any
wrong
knowingly
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
had
laid
her
hand
on
the
letter
,
but
Adam
did
not
loose
it
till
he
had
done
speaking
.
<EOS>
She
took
no
notice
of
what
he
said
 
she
had
not
listened
;
but
when
he
loosed
the
letter
,
she
put
it
into
her
pocket
,
without
opening
it
,
and
then
began
to
walk
more
quickly
,
as
if
she
wanted
to
go
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
in
the
right
not
to
read
it
just
yet
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Read
it
when
you
're
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
stay
out
a
little
bit
longer
,
and
let
us
call
the
children
:
you
look
so
white
and
ill
,
your
aunt
may
take
notice
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
heard
the
warning
.
<EOS>
It
recalled
to
her
the
necessity
of
rallying
her
native
powers
of
concealment
,
which
had
half
given
way
under
the
shock
of
Adam
's
words
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
the
letter
in
her
pocket
:
she
was
sure
there
was
comfort
in
that
letter
in
spite
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
She
ran
to
find
Totty
,
and
soon
reappeared
with
recovered
colour
,
leading
Totty
,
who
was
making
a
sour
face
because
she
had
been
obliged
to
throw
away
an
unripe
apple
that
she
had
set
her
small
teeth
in
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hegh
,
Totty
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
come
and
ride
on
my
shoulder
 
ever
so
high
 
<EOS>
you
'll
touch
the
tops
<EOS>
o
'
the
trees
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
What
little
child
ever
refused
to
be
comforted
by
that
glorious
sense
of
being
seized
strongly
and
swung
upward
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
Ganymede
cried
when
the
eagle
carried
him
away
,
and
perhaps
deposited
him
on
Jove
's
shoulder
at
the
end
.
<EOS>
Totty
smiled
down
complacently
from
her
secure
height
,
and
pleasant
was
the
sight
to
the
mother
's
eyes
,
as
she
stood
at
the
house
door
and
saw
Adam
coming
with
his
small
burden
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
your
sweet
face
,
my
pet
,
"
she
said
,
the
mother
's
strong
love
filling
her
keen
eyes
with
mildness
,
as
Totty
leaned
forward
and
put
out
her
arms
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
eyes
for
Hetty
at
that
moment
,
and
only
said
,
without
looking
at
her
,
"
You
go
and
draw
some
ale
,
Hetty
;
the
gells
are
both
at
the
cheese
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
the
ale
had
been
drawn
and
her
uncle
's
pipe
lighted
,
there
was
Totty
to
be
taken
to
bed
,
and
brought
down
again
in
her
night
-
gown
because
she
would
cry
instead
of
going
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
supper
to
be
got
ready
,
and
Hetty
must
be
continually
in
the
way
to
give
help
.
<EOS>
Adam
stayed
till
he
knew
Mrs.
Poyser
expected
him
to
go
,
engaging
her
and
her
husband
in
talk
as
constantly
as
he
could
,
for
the
sake
of
leaving
Hetty
more
at
ease
.
<EOS>
He
lingered
,
because
he
wanted
to
see
her
safely
through
that
evening
,
and
he
was
delighted
to
find
how
much
self
-
command
she
showed
.
<EOS>
He
knew
she
had
not
had
time
to
read
the
letter
,
but
he
did
not
know
she
was
buoyed
up
by
a
secret
hope
that
the
letter
would
contradict
everything
he
had
said
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
work
for
him
to
leave
her
 
hard
to
think
that
he
should
not
know
for
days
how
she
was
bearing
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
he
must
go
at
last
,
and
all
he
could
do
was
to
press
her
hand
gently
as
he
said
"
Good
-
bye
,
"
and
hope
she
would
take
that
as
a
sign
that
if
his
love
could
ever
be
a
refuge
for
her
,
it
was
there
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
How
busy
his
thoughts
were
,
as
he
walked
home
,
in
devising
pitying
excuses
for
her
folly
,
in
referring
all
her
weakness
to
the
sweet
lovingness
of
her
nature
,
in
blaming
Arthur
,
with
less
and
less
inclination
to
admit
that
his
conduct
might
be
extenuated
too
!
<EOS>
His
exasperation
at
Hetty
's
suffering
 
and
also
at
the
sense
that
she
was
possibly
thrust
for
ever
out
of
his
own
reach
 
deafened
him
to
any
plea
for
the
miscalled
friend
who
had
wrought
this
misery
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
a
clear
-
sighted
,
fair
-
minded
man
 
a
fine
fellow
,
indeed
,
morally
as
well
as
physically
.
<EOS>
But
if
Aristides
the
Just
was
ever
in
love
and
jealous
,
he
was
at
that
moment
not
perfectly
magnanimous
.
<EOS>
And
I
can
not
pretend
that
Adam
,
in
these
painful
days
,
felt
nothing
but
righteous
indignation
and
loving
pity
.
<EOS>
He
was
bitterly
jealous
,
and
in
proportion
as
his
love
made
him
indulgent
in
his
judgment
of
Hetty
,
the
bitterness
found
a
vent
in
his
feeling
towards
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
head
was
allays
likely
to
be
turned
,
"
he
thought
,
"
when
a
gentleman
,
with
his
fine
manners
,
and
fine
clothes
,
and
his
white
hands
,
and
that
way
o
'
talking
gentlefolks
have
,
came
about
her
,
making
up
to
her
in
a
bold
way
,
as
a
man
could
n't
do
that
was
only
her
equal
;
and
it
's
much
if
she
'll
ever
like
a
common
man
now
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
not
help
drawing
his
own
hands
out
of
his
pocket
and
looking
at
them
 
at
the
hard
palms
and
the
broken
finger
-
nails
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
roughish
fellow
,
altogether
;
I
do
n't
know
,
now
I
come
to
think
on't
,
what
there
is
much
for
a
woman
to
like
about
me
;
and
yet
I
might
ha
'
got
another
wife
easy
enough
,
if
I
had
n't
set
my
heart
on
her
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
little
matter
what
other
women
think
about
me
,
if
she
ca
n't
love
me
.
<EOS>
She
might
ha
'
loved
me
,
perhaps
,
as
likely
as
any
other
man
 
there
's
nobody
hereabouts
as
I
'm
afraid
of
,
if
he
had
n't
come
between
us
;
but
now
I
shall
belike
be
hateful
to
her
because
I
'm
so
different
to
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
's
no
telling
 
<EOS>
she
may
turn
round
the
other
way
,
when
she
finds
he
's
made
light
of
her
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
She
may
come
to
feel
the
vally
of
a
man
as
'
ud
be
thankful
to
be
bound
to
her
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
put
up
with
it
whichever
way
<EOS>
it
is
 
I
've
only
to
be
thankful
it
's
been
no
worse
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
th
'
<EOS>
only
man
that
's
got
to
do
without
much
happiness
<EOS>
i
'
this
life
.
<EOS>
There
's
many
a
good
bit
<EOS>
o
'
work
done
with
a
bad
heart
.
<EOS>
It
's
God
's
will
,
and
that
's
enough
for
us
:
<EOS>
we
should
n't
know
better
how
things
ought
to
be
than
He
does
,
I
reckon
,
if
we
was
to
spend
our
lives
i
'
puzzling
.
<EOS>
But
it
'
ud
ha
'
gone
near
to
spoil
my
work
for
me
,
if
I
'd
seen
her
brought
to
sorrow
and
shame
,
and
through
the
man
as
I
've
always
been
proud
to
think
on
.
<EOS>
Since
I
've
been
spared
that
,
I
've
no
right
to
grumble
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
's
got
his
limbs
whole
,
he
can
bear
a
smart
cut
or
two
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Adam
was
getting
over
a
stile
at
this
point
in
his
reflections
,
he
perceived
a
man
walking
along
the
field
before
him
.
<EOS>
He
knew
it
was
Seth
,
returning
from
an
evening
preaching
,
and
made
haste
to
overtake
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
thee'dst
be
at
home
before
me
,
"
he
said
,
as
Seth
turned
round
to
wait
for
him
,
"
for
I
'm
later
than
usual
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
'm
later
too
,
for
I
got
into
talk
,
after
meeting
,
with
John
Barnes
,
who
has
lately
professed
himself
in
a
state
of
perfection
,
and
I
'd
a
question
to
ask
him
about
his
experience
.
<EOS>
It
's
one
<EOS>
o
'
them
subjects
that
lead
you
further
than
y
'
expect
 
they
do
n't
lie
along
the
straight
road
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
along
together
in
silence
two
or
three
minutes
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
not
inclined
to
enter
into
the
subtleties
of
religious
experience
,
but
he
was
inclined
to
interchange
a
word
or
two
of
brotherly
affection
and
confidence
with
Seth
.
<EOS>
That
was
a
rare
impulse
in
him
,
much
as
the
brothers
loved
each
other
.
<EOS>
They
hardly
ever
spoke
of
personal
matters
,
or
uttered
more
than
an
allusion
to
their
family
troubles
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
by
nature
reserved
in
all
matters
of
feeling
,
and
Seth
felt
a
certain
timidity
towards
his
more
practical
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seth
,
lad
,
<EOS>
"
Adam
said
,
putting
his
arm
on
his
brother
's
shoulder
,
"
hast
heard
anything
from
Dinah
Morris
since
she
went
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
told
me
I
might
write
her
word
after
a
while
,
how
we
went
on
,
and
how
mother
bore
up
under
her
trouble
.
<EOS>
So
I
wrote
to
her
a
fortnight
ago
,
and
told
her
about
thee
having
a
new
employment
,
and
how
Mother
was
more
contented
;
and
last
Wednesday
,
when
I
called
at
the
post
at
Treddles'on
,
I
found
a
letter
from
her
.
<EOS>
I
think
thee'dst
perhaps
like
to
read
it
,
but
<EOS>
I
didna
say
anything
about
it
because
thee'st
seemed
so
full
of
other
things
.
<EOS>
It
's
quite
easy
t
'
read
 
<EOS>
she
writes
wonderful
for
a
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
had
drawn
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
to
Adam
,
who
said
,
as
he
took
it
,
"
Aye

lad
,
I
've

a
tough
load

<EOS>
"
I
take
<EOS>

"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
Mother
opening
the
door
to
look
out
for
us
,
"
said
Adam
,
as
they
mounted
the
slope
.
<EOS>
"
She
's

sitting
i

the

<EOS>
Well

Gyp

well

"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
went
in
again
quickly
and
lighted
a
candle
,
for
she
had
heard
the
welcome
rustling
of
footsteps
on
the
grass
,
before
Gyp
's
joyful
bark
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh

"

Adam
;

added

taking
some

looked
up
towards

troubled

Do

take
notice

Adam
,
meanwhile
,
was
reading
Dinah
's
letter
by
the
light
of
his
dip
candle
.
   
<EOS>
DEAR
BROTHER
SETH
 
<EOS>
Your
letter
lay
three
days
beyond
my
knowing
of
it
at
the
post
,
for
I
had
not
money
enough
by
me
to
pay
the
carriage
,
<EOS>
this
being
a
time
of
great
need
and
sickness
here
,
with
the
rains
that
have
fallen
,
as
if
the
windows
of
heaven
were
opened
again
;
and
to
lay
by
money
,
from
day
to
day
,
in
such
a
time
,
when
there
are
so
many
in
present
need
of
all
things
,
would
be
a
want
of
trust
like
the
laying
up
of
the
manna
.
<EOS>
I
speak
of
this
,
because
I
would
not
have
you
think
me
slow
to
answer
,
or
that
I
had
small
joy
in
your
rejoicing
at
the
worldly
good
that
has
befallen
your
brother
Adam
.
<EOS>
The
honour
and
love
you
bear
him
is
nothing
but
meet
,
for
God
has
given
him
great
gifts
,
and
he
uses
them
as
the
patriarch
Joseph
did
,
who
,
when
he
was
exalted
to
a
place
of
power
and
trust
,
yet
yearned
with
tenderness
towards
his
parent
and
his
younger
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
heart
is
knit
to
your
aged
mother
since
it
was
granted
me
to
be
near
her
in
the
day
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
her
of
me
,
and
tell
her
I
often
bear
her
in
my
thoughts
at
evening
time
,
when
I
am
sitting
in
the
dim
light
as
I
did
with
her
,
and
we
held
one
another
's
hands
,
and
I
spoke
the
words
of
comfort
that
were
given
to
me
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
that
is
a
blessed
time
,
is
n't
it
,
Seth
,
when
the
outward
light
is
fading
,
and
the
body
is
a
little
wearied
with
its
work
and
its
labour
.
<EOS>
Then
the
inward
light
shines
the
brighter
,
and
we
have
a
deeper
sense
of
resting
on
the
Divine
strength
.
<EOS>
I
sit
on
my
chair
in
the
dark
room
and
close
my
eyes
,
and
it
is
as
if
I
was
out
of
the
body
and
could
feel
no
want
for
evermore
.
<EOS>
For
then
,
the
very
hardship
,
and
the
sorrow
,
and
the
blindness
,
and
the
sin
I
have
beheld
and
been
ready
to
weep
over
 
yea
,
all
the
anguish
of
the
children
of
men
,
which
sometimes
wraps
me
round
like
sudden
darkness
 
I
can
bear
with
a
willing
pain
,
as
if
I
was
sharing
the
Redeemer
's
cross
.
<EOS>
For
I
feel
it
<EOS>
,
I
feel
it
 
infinite
love
is
suffering
too
 
yea
,
in
the
fulness
of
knowledge
<EOS>
it
suffers
,
it
yearns
,
it
mourns
;
and
that
is
a
blind
self
-
seeking
which
wants
to
be
freed
from
the
sorrow
wherewith
the
whole
creation
groaneth
and
travaileth
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
is
not
true
blessedness
to
be
free
from
sorrow
,
while
there
is
sorrow
and
sin
in
the
world
:
sorrow
is
then
a
part
of
love
,
and
love
does
not
seek
to
throw
it
off
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
spirit
only
that
tells
me
this
 
<EOS>
I
see
it
in
the
whole
work
and
word
of
the
Gospel
.
<EOS>
Is
there
not
pleading
in
heaven
?
<EOS>
Is
not
the
Man
of
Sorrows
there
in
that
crucified
body
wherewith
he
ascended
?
<EOS>
And
is
He
not
one
with
the
Infinite
Love
itself
 
as
our
love
is
one
with
our
sorrow
?
  
<EOS>
"
These
thoughts
have
been
much
borne
in
on
me
of
late
,
and
I
have
seen
with
new
clearness
the
meaning
of
those
words
,
"
If
any
man
love
me
,
let
him
take
up
my
cross
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
this
enlarged
on
as
if
it
meant
the
troubles
and
persecutions
we
bring
on
ourselves
by
confessing
Jesus
.
<EOS>
But
surely
that
is
a
narrow
thought
.
<EOS>
The
true
cross
of
the
Redeemer
was
the
sin
and
sorrow
of
this
world
 
<EOS>
that
was
what
lay
heavy
on
his
heart
 
<EOS>
and
that
is
the
cross
we
shall
share
with
him
<EOS>
,
that
is
the
cup
we
must
drink
of
with
him
,
if
we
would
have
any
part
in
that
Divine
Love
which
is
one
with
his
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
my
outward
lot
,
which
you
ask
about
,
I
have
all
things
and
abound
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
constant
work
in
the
mill
,
though
some
of
the
other
hands
have
been
turned
off
for
a
time
,
and
my
body
is
greatly
strengthened
,
so
that
I
feel
little
weariness
after
long
walking
and
speaking
.
<EOS>
What
you
say
about
staying
in
your
own
country
with
your
mother
and
brother
shows
me
that
you
have
a
true
guidance
;
your
lot
is
appointed
there
by
a
clear
showing
,
and
to
seek
a
greater
blessing
elsewhere
would
be
like
laying
a
false
offering
on
the
altar
and
expecting
the
fire
from
heaven
to
kindle
it
.
<EOS>
My
work
and
my
joy
are
here
among
the
hills
,
and
I
sometimes
think
I
cling
too
much
to
my
life
among
the
people
here
,
and
should
be
rebellious
if
I
was
called
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
thankful
for
your
tidings
about
the
dear
friends
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
for
though
I
sent
them
a
letter
,
by
my
aunt
's
desire
,
after
I
came
back
from
my
sojourn
among
them
,
I
have
had
no
word
from
them
.
<EOS>
My
aunt
has
not
the
pen
of
a
ready
writer
,
and
the
work
of
the
house
is
sufficient
for
the
day
,
for
she
is
weak
in
body
.
<EOS>
My
heart
cleaves
to
her
and
her
children
as
the
nearest
of
all
to
me
in
the
flesh
 
yea
,
and
to
all
in
that
house
.
<EOS>
I
am
carried
away
to
them
continually
in
my
sleep
,
and
often
in
the
midst
of
work
,
and
even
of
speech
,
the
thought
of
them
is
borne
in
on
me
as
if
they
were
in
need
and
trouble
,
which
yet
is
dark
to
me
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
some
leading
here
;
but
I
wait
to
be
taught
.
<EOS>
You
say
they
are
all
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
each
other
again
in
the
body
,
I
trust
,
though
,
it
may
be
,
not
for
a
long
while
;
for
the
brethren
and
sisters
at
Leeds
are
desirous
to
have
me
for
a
short
space
among
them
,
when
I
have
a
door
opened
me
again
to
leave
Snowfield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
dear
brother
 
and
yet
not
farewell
.
<EOS>
For
those
children
of
God
whom
it
has
been
granted
to
see
each
other
face
to
face
,
and
to
hold
communion
together
,
and
to
feel
the
same
spirit
working
in
both
can
never
more
be
sundered
though
the
hills
may
lie
between
.
<EOS>
For
their
souls
are
enlarged
for
evermore
by
that
union
,
and
they
bear
one
another
about
in
their
thoughts
continually
as
it
were
a
new
strength

I
have
not
skill
to
write

words
so
small

moves
slow

And
so
I
am
straitened

Adam
had
refolded
the
letter
,
and
was
sitting
meditatively
with
his
head
resting
on
his
arm
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
when
Seth
came
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hast
read

said

"
Yes

But
she
's
one

does

I
seemed
to
see

hear
her
speaking
when
I
read
the
letter

It

wonderful
how
I
remember

looks

"
It

that

said
Seth

despondingly

"
<EOS>
She
spoke
so
firm

she
's
not
the
woman

say
one

mean
another

may

by

by
:

I
'd
make
it
convenient
for
thee
to
be
away
three
or
four
days
,
and
it

be
no
walk
for
thee
 
only
between
twenty
and
thirty
mile

I
should
like

see
her
again

whether

going

'll

Adam
emphatically

getting
up

throwing
off

be

great
happiness

wonderful

rather
timidly

Adam
made
no
reply
to
that
,
and
no
other
word
but
"
good
-
night
"
passed
between
them
.
    
<EOS>
In
Hetty
's
Bed
-
Chamber
  
<EOS>
IT
was
no
longer
light
enough
to
go
to
bed
without
a
candle
,
even
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
early
household
,
and
Hetty
carried
one
with
her
as
she
went
up
at
last
to
her
bedroom
soon
after
Adam
was
gone
,
and
bolted
the
door
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
Now
she
would
read
her
letter
.
<EOS>
It
must
 
it
must
have
comfort
in
it
.
<EOS>
How
was
Adam
to
know
the
truth
?
<EOS>
It
was
always
likely
he
should
say
what
he
did
say
.
  
<EOS>
She
set
down
the
candle
and
took
out
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
faint
scent
of
roses
,
which
made
her
feel
as
if
Arthur
were
close
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
put
it
to
her
lips
,
and
a
rush
of
remembered
sensations
for
a
moment
or
two
swept
away
all
fear
.
<EOS>
But
her
heart
began
to
flutter
strangely
,
and
her
hands
to
tremble
as
she
broke
the
seal
.
<EOS>
She
read
slowly
;
it
was
not
easy
for
her
to
read
a
gentleman
's
handwriting
,
though
Arthur
had
taken
pains
to
write
plainly

"
DEAREST
HETTY
 
<EOS>
I
have
spoken
truly
when
I
have
said
that
I
loved
you
,
and
I
shall
never
forget
our
love
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
your
true
friend
as
long
as
life
lasts
,
and
I
hope
to
prove
this
to
you
in
many
ways
.
<EOS>
If
I
say
anything
to
pain
you
in
this
letter
,
do
not
believe
it
is
for
want
of
love
and
tenderness
towards
you
,
for
there
is
nothing
I
would
not
do
for
you
,
if
I
knew
it
to
be
really
for
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
think
of
my
little
Hetty
shedding
tears
when
I
am
not
there
to
kiss
them
away
;
and
if
I
followed
only
my
own
inclinations
,
I
should
be
with
her
at
this
moment
instead
of
writing
.
<EOS>
It
is
very
hard
for
me
to
part
from
her
 
harder
still
for
me
to
write
words
which
may
seem
unkind
,
though
they
spring
from
the
truest
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
,
dear
Hetty
,
sweet
as
our
love
has
been
to
me
,
sweet
as
it
would
be
to
me
for
you
to
love
me
always
,
I
feel
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
us
both
if
we
had
never
had
that
happiness
,
and
that
it
is
my
duty
to
ask
you
to
love
me
and
care
for
me
as
little
as
you
can
.

The
fault
has
all
been
mine
,
for
though
I
have
been
unable
to
resist
the
longing
to
be
near
you
<EOS>
,
I
have
felt
all
the
while
that
your
affection
for
me
might
cause
you
grief
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
resisted
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
done
so
,
if
I
had
been
a
better
fellow
than
I
am
;
but
now
,
since
the
past
can
not
be
altered
,
I
am
bound
to
save
you
from
any
evil
that
I
have
power
to
prevent
.
<EOS>
And
I
feel
it
would
be
a
great
evil
for
you
if
your
affections
continued
so
fixed
on
me
that
you
could
think
of
no
other
man
who
might
be
able
to
make
you
happier
by
his
love
than
I
ever
can
,
and
if
you
continued
to
look
towards
something
in
the
future
which
can
not
possibly
happen
.
<EOS>
For
,
dear
Hetty
,
if
I
were
to
do
what
you
one
day
spoke
of
,
and
make
you
my
wife
,
I
should
do
what
you
yourself
would
come
to
feel
was
for
your
misery
instead
of
your
welfare
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
can
never
be
happy
except
by
marrying
a
man
in
your
own
station
;
and
if
I
were
to
marry
you
now
,
I
should
only
be
adding
to
any
wrong
I
have
done
,
besides
offending
against
my
duty
in
the
other
relations
of
life
.
<EOS>
You
know
nothing
,
dear
Hetty
,
of
the
world
in
which
I
must
always
live
,
and
you
would
soon
begin
to
dislike
me
,
because
there
would
be
so
little
in
which
we
should
be
alike
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
since
I
can
not
marry
you
,
we
must
part
 
<EOS>
we
must
try
not
to
feel
like
lovers
any
more
.
<EOS>
I
am
miserable
while
I
say
this
,
but
nothing
else
can
be
.
<EOS>
Be
angry
with
me
,
my
sweet
one
,
I
deserve
it
;
but
do
not
believe
that
I
shall
not
always
care
for
you
 
<EOS>
always
be
grateful
to
you
 
<EOS>
always
remember
my
Hetty
;
and
if
any
trouble
should
come
that
we
do
not
now
foresee
,
trust
in
me
to
do
everything
that
lies
in
my
power
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
told
you
where
you
are
to
direct
a
letter
to
,
if
you
want
to
write
,
but
I
put
it
down
below
lest
you
should
have
forgotten
.
<EOS>
Do
not
write
unless
there
is
something
I
can
really
do
for
you
;
for
,
dear
Hetty
,
we
must
try
to
think
of
each
other
as
little
as
we
can
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
and
try
to
forget
everything
about
me
,
except
that
I
shall
be
,
as
long
as
I
live
,
your
affectionate
friend
,

<EOS>
Slowly
Hetty
had
read
this
letter
;
and
when
she
looked
up
from
it
there
was
the
reflection
of
a
blanched
face
in
the
old
dim
glass
 
a
white
marble
face
with
rounded
childish
forms
,
but
with
something
sadder
than
a
child
's
pain
in
it
.
<EOS>
Hetty
did
not
see
the
face
 
<EOS>
she
saw
nothing
 
<EOS>
she
only
felt
that
she
was
cold
and
sick
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
The
letter
shook
and
rustled
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
laid
it
down
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
horrible
sensation
 
this
cold
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
It
swept
away
the
very
ideas
that
produced
it
,
and
Hetty
got
up
to
reach
a
warm
cloak
from
her
clothes
-
press
,
wrapped
it
round
her
,
and
sat
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
nothing
but
getting
warm
.
<EOS>
Presently
she
took
up
the
letter
with
a
firmer
hand
,
and
began
to
read
it
through
again
.
<EOS>
The
tears
came
this
time
 
great
rushing
tears
that
blinded
her
and
blotched
the
paper
.
<EOS>
She
felt
nothing
but
that
Arthur
was
cruel
 
cruel
to
write
so
,
cruel
not
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
Reasons
why
he
could
not
marry
her
had
no
existence
for
her
mind
;
how
could
she
believe
in
any
misery
that
could
come
to
her
from
the
fulfilment
of
all
she
had
been
longing
for
and
dreaming
of
?
<EOS>
She
had
not
the
ideas
that
could
make
up
the
notion
of
that
misery
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
threw
down
the
letter
again
,
she
caught
sight
of
her
face
in
the
glass
;
it
was
reddened
now
,
and
wet
with
tears
;
it
was
almost
like
a
companion
that
she
might
complain
to
 
that
would
pity
her
.
<EOS>
She
leaned
forward
on
her
elbows
,
and
looked
into
those
dark
overflooding
eyes
and
at
the
quivering
mouth
,
and
saw
how
the
tears
came
thicker
and
thicker
,
and
how
the
mouth
became
convulsed
with
sobs
.
  
<EOS>
The
shattering
of
all
her
little
dream
-
world
,
the
crushing
blow
on
her
new
-
born
passion
,
afflicted
her
pleasure
-
craving
nature
with
an
overpowering
pain
that
annihilated
all
impulse
to
resistance
,
and
suspended
her
anger
.
<EOS>
She
sat
sobbing
till
the
candle
went
out
,
and
then
,
wearied
,
aching
,
stupefied
with
crying
,
threw
herself
on
the
bed
without
undressing
and
went
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
feeble
dawn
in
the
room
when
Hetty
awoke
,
a
little
after
four
o'clock
,
with
a
sense
of
dull
misery
,
<EOS>
the
cause
of
which
broke
upon
her
gradually
as
she
began
to
discern
the
objects
round
her
in
the
dim
light
.
<EOS>
And
then
came
the
frightening
thought
that
she
had
to
conceal
her
misery
as
well
as
to
bear
it
,
in
this
dreary
daylight
that
was
coming
.
<EOS>
She
could
lie
no
longer
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
and
went
towards
the
table
:
there
lay
the
letter
.
<EOS>
She
opened
her
treasure
-
drawer
:
there
lay
the
ear
-
rings
and
the
locket
 
<EOS>
the
signs
of
all
her
short
happiness
 
<EOS>
the
signs
of
the
lifelong
dreariness
that
was
to
follow
it
.
<EOS>
Looking
at
the
little
trinkets
which
she
had
once
eyed
and
fingered
so
fondly
as
the
earnest
of
her
future
paradise
of
finery
,
she
lived
back
in
the
moments
when
they
had
been
given
to
her
with
such
tender
caresses
,
such
strangely
pretty
words
,
such
glowing
looks
,
which
filled
her
with
a
bewildering
delicious
surprise
 
<EOS>
they
were
so
much
sweeter
than
she
had
thought
anything
could
be
.
<EOS>
And
the
Arthur
who
had
spoken
to
her
and
looked
at
her
in
this
way
,
who
was
present
with
her
now
 
whose
arm
she
felt
round
her
,
his
cheek
against
hers
<EOS>
,
his
very
breath
upon
her
 
was
the
cruel
,
cruel
Arthur
who
had
written
that
letter
,
that
letter
which
she
snatched
and
crushed
and
then
opened
again
,
that
she
might
read
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
The
half
-
benumbed
mental
condition
which
was
the
effect
of
the
last
night
's
violent
crying
made
it
necessary
to
her
to
look
again
and
see
if
her
wretched
thoughts
were
actually
true
 
if
the
letter
was
really
so
cruel
.
<EOS>
She
had
to
hold
it
close
to
the
window
,
else
she
could
not
have
read
it
by
the
faint
light
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
It
was
worse
 
<EOS>
it
was
more
cruel
.
<EOS>
She
crushed
it
up
again
in
anger
.
<EOS>
She
hated
the
writer
of
that
letter
 
hated
him
for
the
very
reason
that
she
hung
upon
him
with
all
her
love
 
all
the
girlish
passion
and
vanity
that
made
up
her
love
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
no
tears
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
had
wept
them
all
away
last
night
,
and
now
she
felt
that
dry
-
eyed
morning
misery
,
which
is
worse
than
the
first
shock
because
it
has
the
future
in
it
as
well
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
Every
morning
to
come
,
as
far
as
her
imagination
could
stretch
,
she
would
have
to
get
up
and
feel
that
the
day
would
have
no
joy
for
her
.
<EOS>
For
there
is
no
despair
<EOS>
so
absolute
as
that
which
comes
with
the
first
moments
of
our
first
great
sorrow
,
when
we
have
not
yet
known
what
it
is
to
have
suffered
and
be
healed
,
to
have
despaired
and
to
have
recovered
hope
.
<EOS>
As
Hetty
began
languidly
to
take
off
the
clothes
she
had
worn
all
the
night
,
that
she
might
wash
herself
and
brush
her
hair
,
she
had
a
sickening
sense
that
her
life
would
go
on
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
She
should
always
be
doing
things
she
had
no
pleasure
in
,
getting
up
to
the
old
tasks
of
work
,
seeing
people
she
cared
nothing
about
,
going
to
church
,
and
to
Treddleston
,
and
to
tea
with
Mrs.
Best
,
and
carrying
no
happy
thought
with
her
.
<EOS>
For
her
short
poisonous
delights
had
spoiled
for
ever
all
the
little
joys
that
had
once
made
the
sweetness
of
her
life
 
the
new
frock
ready
for
Treddleston
Fair
,
the
party
at
Mr.
Britton
's
at
Broxton
wake
,
the
beaux
that
she
would
say
"
No
"
to
for
a
long
while
,
and
the
prospect
of
the
wedding
that
was
to
come
at
last
when
she
would
have
a
silk
gown
and
a
great
many
clothes
all
at
once
.
<EOS>
These
things
were
all
flat
and
dreary
to
her
now
;
everything
would
be
a
weariness
,
and
she
would
carry
about
for
ever
a
hopeless
thirst
and
longing
.
  
<EOS>
She
paused
in
the
midst
of
her
languid
undressing
and
leaned
against
the
dark
old
clothes
-
press
.
<EOS>
Her
neck
and
arms
were
bare
,
her
hair
hung
down
in
delicate
rings
 
<EOS>
and
they
were
just
as
beautiful
as
they
were
that
night
two
months
ago
,
when
she
walked
up
and
down
this
bed
-
chamber
glowing
with
vanity
and
hope
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
thinking
of
her
neck
and
arms
now
;
even
her
own
beauty
was
indifferent
to
her
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
wandered
sadly
over
the
dull
old
chamber
,
and
then
looked
out
vacantly
towards
the
growing
dawn
.
<EOS>
Did
a
remembrance
of
Dinah
come
across
her
mind
?
<EOS>
Of
her
foreboding
words
,
which
had
made
her
angry
?
<EOS>
Of
Dinah
's
affectionate
entreaty
to
think
of
her
as
a
friend
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
No
,
the
impression
had
been
too
slight
to
recur
.
<EOS>
Any
affection
or
comfort
Dinah
could
have
given
her
would
have
been
as
indifferent
to
Hetty
this
morning
as
everything
else
was
except
her
bruised
passion
.
<EOS>
She
was
only
thinking
she
could
never
stay
here
and
go
on
with
the
old
life
 
she
could
better
bear
something
quite
new
than
sinking
back
into
the
old
everyday
round
.
<EOS>
She
would
like
to
run
away
that
very
morning
,
and
never
see
any
of
the
old
faces
again
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
's
was
not
a
nature
to
face
difficulties
 
to
dare
to
loose
her
hold
on
the
familiar
and
rush
blindly
on
some
unknown
condition
.
<EOS>
Hers
was
a
luxurious
and
vain
nature
 
<EOS>
not
a
passionate
one
 
<EOS>
and
if
she
were
ever
to
take
any
violent
measure
,
she
must
be
urged
to
it
by
the
desperation
of
terror
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
much
room
for
her
thoughts
to
travel
in
the
narrow
circle
of
her
imagination
,
and
she
soon
fixed
on
the
one
thing
she
would
do
to
get
away
from
her
old
life
:
she
would
ask
her
uncle
to
let
her
go
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
.
<EOS>
Miss
Lydia
's
maid
would
help
her
to
get
a
situation
,
if
she
knew
Hetty
had
her
uncle
's
leave
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
had
thought
of
this
,
she
fastened
up
her
hair
and
began
to
wash
:
it
seemed
more
possible
to
her
to
go
downstairs
and
try
to
behave
as
usual
.
<EOS>
She
would
ask
her
uncle
this
very
day
.
<EOS>
On
Hetty
's
blooming
health
it
would
take
a
great
deal
of
such
mental
suffering
as
hers
to
leave
any
deep
impress
;
and
when
she
was
dressed
as
neatly
as
usual
in
her
working
-
dress
,
with
her
hair
tucked
up
under
her
little
cap
,
an
indifferent
observer
would
have
been
more
struck
with
the
young
roundness
of
her
cheek
and
neck
and
the
darkness
of
her
eyes
and
eyelashes
than
with
any
signs
of
sadness
about
her
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
took
up
the
crushed
letter
and
put
it
in
her
drawer
,
that
she
might
lock
it
out
of
sight
,
hard
smarting
tears
,
having
no
relief
in
them
as
the
great
drops
had
that
fell
last
night
,
forced
their
way
into
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
wiped
them
away
quickly
:
she
must
not
cry
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
Nobody
should
find
out
how
miserable
she
was
,
nobody
should
know
she
was
disappointed
about
anything
;
and
the
thought
that
the
eyes
of
her
aunt
and
uncle
would
be
upon
her
gave
her
the
self
-
command
which
often
accompanies
a
great
dread
.
<EOS>
For
Hetty
looked
out
from
her
secret
misery
towards
the
possibility
of
their
ever
knowing
what
had
happened
,
as
the
sick
and
weary
prisoner
might
think
of
the
possible
pillory
.
<EOS>
They
would
think
her
conduct
shameful
,
and
shame
was
torture
.
<EOS>
That
was
poor
little
Hetty
's
conscience
.
  
<EOS>
So
she
locked
up
her
drawer
and
went
away
to
her
early
work
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
when
Mr.
Poyser
was
smoking
his
pipe
,
and
his
good
-
nature
was
therefore
at
its
superlative
moment
,
Hetty
seized
the
opportunity
of
her
aunt
's
absence
to
say
,
"
Uncle
,
I
wish
you
'd
let
me
go
for
a
lady
's
maid
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
and
looked
at
Hetty
in
mild
surprise
for
some
moments
.
<EOS>
She
was
sewing
,
and
went
on
with
her
work
industriously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
's
put
that
into
your
head
,
my
wench
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
at
last
,
after
he
had
given
one
conservative
puff
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
it
 
<EOS>
I
should
like
it
better
than
farm
-
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
;
you
fancy
so
because
you
donna
know
it
,
my
wench
.
<EOS>
It
would
n't
be
half
so
good
for
your
health
,
nor
for
your
luck
<EOS>
i
'
life
.
<EOS>
I
'd
like
you
to
stay
wi
'
us
till
you
've
got
a
good
husband
<EOS>
:
you
're
my
own
niece
,
and
I
would
n't
have
you
go
to
service
,
though
it
was
a
gentleman
's
house
,
as
long
as
I
've
got
a
home
for
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
paused
,
and
puffed
away
at
his

It

for

old
Martin
,
with
an
elongation
of
the
word

meant
to
make
it
bitter
as
well
as
negative
,
while

leaned
forward

"
  
<EOS>
It
was
seldom
the
old
man
made
so
long
a
speech
,
but
his
son
's
question
had
fallen
like
a
bit
of
dry
fuel
on
the
embers
of
a
long
unextinguished
resentment
,
which
had
always
made
the
grandfather
more
indifferent
to
Hetty
than
to
his
son
's
children
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
's
fortune
had
been
spent
by
that
good
-
for
-
nought
Sorrel
,
and
Hetty
had
Sorrel
's
blood
in
her
veins
.
  
<EOS>
"
Poor
thing
,
poor
thing
!
"
said
Martin
the
younger
,
who
was
sorry
to
have
provoked
this
retrospective
harshness
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
'd
but
bad
luck
.
<EOS>
But
Hetty
's
got
as
good
<EOS>
a
chance
<EOS>
o
'
getting
a
solid
,
sober
husband
as
any
gell
<EOS>
i
'
this
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
throwing
out
this
pregnant
hint
,
Mr.
Poyser
recurred
to
his
pipe
and
his
silence
,
looking
at
Hetty
to
see
if
she
did
not
give
some
sign
of
having
renounced
her
ill
-
advised
wish
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
that
,
Hetty
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
began
to
cry
,
half
out
of
ill
temper
at
the
denial
,
half
out
of
the
day
's
repressed
sadness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hegh
,
hegh
!
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
meaning
to
check
her
playfully
,
"
do
n't
let
's
have
any
crying

<EOS>
Crying
's
for
them
<EOS>
as

not
for

to
get

<EOS>
What

<EOS>
"
he
continued
to
his
wife
,
who
now
came
back
into
the
house
-
place
,
knitting
with
fierce
rapidity
,
as
if
that
movement
were
a
necessary
function
,
like
the
twittering
of
a
crab
's
antennae

<EOS>

Mr.

<EOS>
"
I
tell

"
  
<EOS>

I
thought
she
'd
got
some
maggot
in
her

she
's
gone
about

up

<EOS>
It

all
wi

going

among

as

fools

She

She
thinks
there
's
nothing

maid
but
wearing
finer
clothes
nor
she
was
born
to
,
I
'll
be

<EOS>
It
's
what
rag
<EOS>
she
can
get
to
stick
on
her
as
she
's
thinking
on
from
morning

as
I
often
ask
her
if
she

to

mawkin
<EOS>
i

the
field
,
for
then
she
'd
be
made
o

rags
inside

out

<EOS>
I
'll
never
gi
'
<EOS>
my
consent
to
her
going
for
a
lady
's
maid
,
while
she
's
got
good
friends
to
take
care
on
her
till
she
's
married
to
somebody
better

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

said
Mr.

,
"

<EOS>
When
Hetty
was
gone
upstairs
he
said
,
"
I
canna
make
it
out

should
want

<EOS>

Eh

there
's
no

no

I

<EOS>
"
Thee'dst

<EOS>
"
She

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sorry

<EOS>
Yes

I

never

Mr.

soothingly

"
  
<EOS>
Her
uncle
's
answers
,
however
,
had
had
another
effect
on
Hetty
besides
that
of
disappointing
her
and
making
her
cry
.
<EOS>
She
knew
quite
well
whom
he
had
in
his
mind
in
his
allusions
to
marriage
,
and
to
a
sober
,
solid
husband
;
and
when
she
was
in
her
bedroom
again
,
the
possibility
of
her
marrying
Adam
presented
itself
to
her
in
a
new
light
.
<EOS>
In
a
mind
where
no
strong
sympathies
are
at
work
,
where
there
is
no
supreme
sense
of
right
to
which
the
agitated
nature
can
cling
and
steady
itself
to
quiet
endurance
,
one
of
the
first
results
of
sorrow
is
a
desperate
vague
clutching
after
any
deed
that
will
change
the
actual
condition
.
<EOS>
Poor
Hetty
's
vision
of
consequences
,
at
no
time
more
than
a
narrow
fantastic
calculation
of
her
own
probable
pleasures
and
pains
,
was
now
quite
shut
out
by
reckless
irritation
under
present
suffering
,
and
she
was
ready
for
one
of
those
convulsive
,
motiveless
actions
by
which
wretched
men
and
women
leap
from
a
temporary
sorrow
into
a
lifelong
misery
.
  
<EOS>
Why
should
she
not
marry
Adam
?
<EOS>
She
did
not
care
what
she
did
,
so
that
it
made
some
change
in
her
life
.
<EOS>
She
felt
confident
that
he
would
still
want
to
marry
her
,
and
any
further
thought
about
Adam
's
happiness
in
the
matter
had
never
yet
visited
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Strange
!
"
<EOS>
perhaps
you
will
say
,
"
this
rush
of
impulse
to
-
wards
a
course
that
might
have
seemed
the
most
repugnant
to
her
present
state
of
mind
,
and
in
only
the
second
night
of
her
sadness
!
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
the
actions
of
a
little
trivial
soul
like
Hetty
's
,
struggling
amidst
the
serious
sad
destinies
of
a
human
being
,
are
strange
.
<EOS>
So
are
the
motions
of
a
little
vessel
without
ballast
tossed
about
on
a
stormy
sea
.
<EOS>
How
pretty
it
looked
with
its
parti
-
coloured
sail
in
the
sunlight
,
moored
in
the
quiet
bay
!
  
<EOS>
"
Let
that
man
bear
the
loss
who
loosed
it
from
its
moorings
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
that
will
not
save
the
vessel
 
<EOS>
the
pretty
thing
that
might
have
been
a
lasting
joy

THE
next
Saturday
evening
there
was
much
excited
discussion
at
the
Donnithorne
Arms
concerning
an
incident
which
had
occurred
that
very
day
 
no
less
than
a
second
appearance
of
the
smart
man
in
top
-
boots
said
by
some
to
be
a
mere
farmer
in
treaty
for
the
Chase
Farm
,
by
others
to
be
the
future
steward
,
but
by
Mr.
Casson
himself
,
the
personal
witness
to
the
stranger
's
visit
,
pronounced
contemptuously
to
be
nothing
better
than
a
bailiff
,
such
as
Satchell
had
been
before
him
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
thought
of
denying
Mr.
Casson
's
testimony
to
the
fact
that
he
had
seen
the
stranger
;
nevertheless
,
he
proffered
various
corroborating
circumstances
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
myself
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
see
him
coming
along
by
the
Crab
-
tree
Meadow
on
a
bald
-
faced
hoss
.
<EOS>
I
'd
just
been
t

hev
a
pint
 
<EOS>
it
was
half
after
ten
<EOS>
i

<EOS>
the
fore
-
noon
,
when
I
hev
my
pint
as
reg'lar
as
the
clock
 
<EOS>
and
I
says
to
Knowles
,
as
druv
up
with
his
waggon
,
"
You
'll
get
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
barley
to

day

Knowles
,
"
I
says
,
"
if
you
look
about
you
"
;
<EOS>
and
then
I
went
round
by
the
rick
-
yard
,
and
towart
the
Treddles'on
road
,
and
just
as
I
come
up
by
the
big
ash
-
tree
,
I
see
the
man
<EOS>
i
'
top
-
boots
coming
along
on
a
bald
-
faced
hoss
 
I
wish
I
may
never
stir
if
I
did
n't
.
<EOS>
And
I
stood
still
till
he
come
up
,
and
I
says
,
"
Good
morning
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
I
says
,
for
I
wanted
to
hear
the
turn
of
his
tongue
,
as
I
might
know
whether
he
was
a
this
-
country
man
;
so
I
says
,
"
Good
morning
,
sir
<EOS>
:
it

There
'll

<EOS>
And
he
says
,
"
Eh
,
ye

be
raight
,
there
's
noo
tallin
'
,
"
he
says
,
<EOS>
and
I
knowed
by
that
"
 
here
Mr.
Casson
gave
a
wink
 
"
as
he
did
n't
come
from
a
hundred
mile
off
.
<EOS>
I
daresay
he
'd
think
me
a
hodd
talker

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The

said
Bartle
Massey
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
about

"
  
<EOS>
"
Well

I
do

answered
Mr.
Casson
,
with
an
angry
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
should

a
man
as

"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye

said
Bartle
,
with
a
tone

sarcastic

When
Mike
Holdsworth
's
goat
says
ba

,
it
's
all
right
 
<EOS>
it
'
ud
be
unnatural
for
it
to
make
any
other
noise

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
being
Loamsnire
men
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Casson
had
the
laugh
strongly
against
him
,
and
wisely
fell
back
on
the
previous
question
,
which
,
far
from
being
exhausted
in
a
single
evening
,
was
renewed
in
the
churchyard
,
before
service
,
the
next
day
,
with
the
fresh
interest
conferred
on
all
news
when
there
is
a
fresh
person
to
hear
it
;
and
that
fresh
hearer
was
Martin
Poyser
,
who
,
as
his
wife
said
,
"
never
went
boozin
'
with
that
set
at
Casson
's
,
a
-
sittin
'
soakin
'
in
drink
,
and
looking
as
wise
as
a
lot
<EOS>
o
'
cod
-
fish
<EOS>
wi
'
red
faces
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
probably
owing
to
the
conversation
she
had
had
with
her
husband
on
their
way
from
church
concerning
this
problematic
stranger
that
Mrs.
Poyser
's
thoughts
immediately
reverted
to
him
when
,
a
day
or
two
afterwards
,
as
she
was
standing
at
the
house
-
door
with
her
knitting
,
<EOS>
in
that
eager
leisure
which
came
to
her
when
the
afternoon
cleaning
was
done
,
she
saw
the
old
squire
enter
the
yard
on
his
black
pony
,
followed
by
John
the
groom
.
<EOS>
She
always
cited
it
afterwards
as
a
case
of
prevision
,
which
really
had
something
more
in
it
than
her
own
remarkable
penetration
,
<EOS>
that
the
moment
she
set
eyes
on
the
squire
she
said
to
herself
,
"
I
shouldna
wonder
if
he
's
come
about
that
man
as
is
a
-
going
to
take
the
Chase
Farm
,
wanting
Poyser
to
do
something
for
him
without
pay
.
<EOS>
But
Poyser
's
a
fool
if
he
does
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Something
unwonted
must
clearly
be
in
the
wind
,
for
the
old
squire
's
visits
to
his
tenantry
were
rare
;
and
though
Mrs.
Poyser
had
during
the
last
twelvemonth
recited
many
imaginary
speeches
,
meaning
even
more
than
met
the
ear
,
which
she
was
quite
determined
to
make
to
him
the
next
time
he
appeared
within
the
gates
of
the
Hall
Farm
,
the
speeches
had
always
remained
imaginary
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
day
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
said
the
old
squire
,
peering
at
her
with
his
short
-
sighted
eyes
 
a
mode
of
looking
at
her
which
,
as
Mrs.
Poyser
observed
,
"
allays
aggravated
me
<EOS>
:
it
was
as
if
you
was
a
insect
,
and
he
was
going
to
dab
his
finger
-
nail
on
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
However
,
she
said
,
"
Your
servant
,
sir
,
"
and
curtsied
with
an
air
of
perfect
deference
as
she
advanced
towards
him
:
<EOS>
she
was
not
the
woman
to
misbehave
towards
her
betters
,
and
fly
in
the
face
of
the
catechism
,
without
severe
provocation
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
husband
at
home
,
Mrs.
Poyser
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
he
's
only
i
'
<EOS>
the
rick
-
yard
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
for
him
in
a
minute
,
if
you
'll
please
to
get
down
and
step
in
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
;
I
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
consult
him
about
a
little
matter
;
but
you
are
quite
as
much
concerned
in
it
,
if
not
more
.
<EOS>
I
must
have
your
opinion
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hetty
,
run
and
tell
your
uncle
to
come
in
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
they
entered
the
house
,
and
the
old
gentleman
bowed
low
in
answer
to
Hetty
's
curtsy
;
while
Totty
,
conscious
of
a
pinafore
stained
with
gooseberry
jam
,
stood
hiding
her
face
against
the
clock
and
peeping
round
furtively
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
fine
old
kitchen
this
is
!
"
said
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
looking
round
admiringly
.
<EOS>
He
always
spoke
in
the
same
deliberate
,
well
-
chiselled
,
polite
way
,
whether
his
words
were
sugary
or
venomous
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
keep
it
so
exquisitely
clean
,
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
I
like
these
premises
,
do
you
know
,
beyond
any
on
the
estate
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
,
since
you
're
fond
of
'em
,
I
should
be
glad
<EOS>
if
you
'd
let
a
bit
o
'
repairs
be
done
to
'em
,
for
the
boarding
's
i
'
that
state
as
we
're
like
to
be
eaten
up
wi
'
rats
and
mice
;
and
the
cellar
,
you
may
stan
'
up
to
your
knees
<EOS>
i
'
water
in't
,
if
you
like
to
go
down
;
but
perhaps
you
'd
rather
believe
my
words
.
<EOS>
Wo
n't
you
please
to
sit
down
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
yet
;
I
must
see
your
dairy
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
seen
it
for
years
,
and
I
hear
on
all
hands
about
your
fine
cheese
and
butter
,
"
said
the
squire
,
looking
politely
unconscious
that
there
could
be
any
question
on
which
he
and
Mrs.
Poyser
might
happen
to
disagree
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
see
the
door
open
,
there
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
be
surprised
if
I
cast
a
covetous
eye
on
your
cream
and
butter
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
expect
that
Mrs.
Satchell
's
cream
and
butter
will
bear
comparison
with
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
,
sir
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
It
's
seldom
<EOS>
I
see
other
folks
's
butter
,
though
there
's
some
on
it
as
one
's
no
need
to
see
 
the
smell
's
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
now
this
I
like
,
"
said
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
looking
round
at
the
damp
temple
of
cleanliness
,
but
keeping
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
I
should
like
my
breakfast
better
if
I
knew
the
butter
and
cream
came
from
this
dairy
.
<EOS>
Thank
you
,
that
really
is
a
pleasant
sight
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
my
slight
tendency
to
rheumatism
makes
me
afraid
of
damp
:
I
'll
sit
down
in
your
comfortable
kitchen
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
Poyser
,
how
do
you
do
?
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
business
,
I
see
,
as
usual
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
looking
at
your
wife
's
beautiful
dairy
 
the
best
manager
in
the
parish
,
is
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
had
just
entered
in
shirt
-
sleeves
and
open
waistcoat
,
with
a
face
a
shade
redder
than
usual
,
from
the
exertion
of
"
pitching
.
"
<EOS>
As
he
stood
,
red
,
rotund
,
and
radiant
,
before
the
small
,
wiry
,
cool
old
gentleman
,
he
looked
like
a
prize
apple
by
the
side
of
a
withered
crab
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
please
to
take
this
chair
,
sir
?
"
he
said
,
lifting
his
father
's
arm
-
chair
forward
a
little
:
"
you
'll
find
it
easy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
thank
you
,
I
never
sit
in
easy
-
chairs
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
seating
himself
on
a
small
chair
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
,
Mrs.
Poyser
 
sit
down
,
pray
,
both
of
you
 
<EOS>
I
've
been
far
from
contented
,
for
some
time
,
with
Mrs.
Satchell
's
dairy
management
.
<EOS>
I
think
she
has
not
a
good
method
,
as
you
have
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
I
ca
n't
speak
to
that
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
in
a
hard
voice
,
rolling
and
unrolling
her
knitting
and
looking
icily
out
of
the
window
,
as
she
continued
to
stand
opposite
the
squire
.
<EOS>
Poyser
might
sit
down
if
he
liked
,
she
thought
;
she
was
n't
going
to
sit
down
,
as
if
she
'd
give
in
to
any
such
smooth
-
tongued
palaver
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
looked
and
felt
the
reverse
of
icy
,
did
sit
down
in
his
three
-
cornered
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
Poyser
,
as
Satchell
is
laid
up
,
I
am
intending
to
let
the
Chase
Farm
to
a
respectable
tenant
.
<EOS>
I
'm
tired
of
having
a
farm
on
my
own
hands
 
nothing
is
made
the
best
of
in
such
cases
,
as
you
know
.
<EOS>
A
satisfactory
bailiff
is
hard
to
find
;
and
I
think
you
and
I
,
Poyser
,
and
your
excellent
wife
here
,
can
enter
into
a
little
arrangement
in
consequence
,
which
will
be
to
our
mutual
advantage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
with
a
good
-
natured
blankness
of
imagination
as
to
the
nature
of
the
arrangement
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
'm
called
upon
to
speak
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
after
glancing
at
her
husband
with
pity
at
his
softness
,
"
you
know
better
than
me
;
but
I
do
n't
see
what
the
Chase
Farm
is
t
'
us
 
<EOS>
we
've
cumber
enough
<EOS>
wi
'
our
own
farm
.
<EOS>
Not
<EOS>
but
what
I
'm
glad
to
hear
o
'
<EOS>
anybody
respectable
coming
into
the
parish
;
there
's
some
as
ha
'
been
brought
in
as
has
n't
been
looked
on
i
'
that
character
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
likely
to
find
Mr.
Thurle
an
excellent
neighbour
,
I
assure
you
 
such
a
one
as
you
will
feel
glad
to
have
accommodated
by
the
little
plan
I
'm
going
to
mention
,
especially
as
I
hope
you
will
find
it
as
much
to
your
own
advantage
as
his
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
sir
,
if
it
's
anything
t
'
our
advantage
,
it
'll
be
the
first
offer
o
'
the
sort
I
've
heared
on
.
<EOS>
It
's
them
as
take
advantage
that
get
advantage
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
this
world
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
Folks
have
to
wait
<EOS>
long
enough
afore
<EOS>
it
's
brought
to
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
Poyser
,
"
said
the
squire
,
ignoring
Mrs.
Poyser
's
theory
of
worldly
prosperity
,
"
there
is
too
much
dairy
land
,
and
too
little
plough
land
,
on
the
Chase
Farm
to
suit
Thurle
's
purpose
 
indeed
<EOS>
,
he
will
only
take
the
farm
on
condition
of
some
change
in
it
:
his
wife
,
it
appears
,
is
not
a
clever
dairy
-
woman
,
like
yours
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
plan
I
'm
thinking
of
is
to
effect
a
little
exchange
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
to
have
the
Hollow
Pastures
,
you
might
increase
your
dairy
,
which
must
be
so
profitable
under
your
wife
's
management
;
and
I
should
request
you
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
to
supply
my
house
with
milk
,
cream
,
and
butter
at
the
market
prices
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
Poyser
,
you
might
let
Thurle
have
the
Lower
and
Upper
Ridges
,
which
really
,
with
our
wet
seasons
,
would
be
a
good
riddance
for
you
.
<EOS>
There
is
much
less
risk
in
dairy
land
than
corn
land
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
was
leaning
forward
,
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
,
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
his
mouth
screwed
up
 
apparently
absorbed
in
making
the
tips
of
his
fingers
meet
so
as
to
represent
with
perfect
accuracy
the
ribs
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
He
was
much
too
acute
a
man
not
to
see
through
the
whole
business
,
and
to
foresee
perfectly
what
would
be
his
wife
's
view
of
the
subject
;
but
he
disliked
giving
unpleasant
answers
.
<EOS>
Unless
it
was
on
a
point
of
farming
practice
,
he
would
rather
give
up
than
have
a
quarrel
,
any
day
;
and
,
after
all
,
it
mattered
more
to
his
wife
than
to
him
.
<EOS>
So
,
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
he
looked
up
at
her
and
said
mildly
,
"
What
dost
say
?
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
had
had
her
eyes
fixed
on
her
husband
with
cold
severity
during
his
silence
,
but
now
she
turned
away
her
head
with
a
toss
,
looked
icily
at
the
opposite
roof
of
the
cow
-
shed
,
and
spearing
her
knitting
together
with
the
loose
pin
,
held
it
firmly
between
her
clasped
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
?
<EOS>
Why
,
I
say
you
may
do
as
you
like
about
giving
up
any
o
'
<EOS>
your
corn
-
land
afore
<EOS>
your
lease
is
up
,
which
it
wo
n't
be
for
a
year
come
next
Michaelmas
,
but
I
'll
not
consent
to
take
more
dairy
work
into
my
hands
,
either
for
love
or
money
;
and
there
's
nayther
love
nor
money
here
,
as
I
can
see
,
on'y
<EOS>
other
folks
's
love
o
'
theirselves
,
and
the
money
as
is
to
go
into
other
folks
's
pockets
.
<EOS>
I
know
there
's
them
as
is
born
t
'
own
the
land
,
and
them
as
is
born
to
sweat
on't
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
here
Mrs.
Poyser
paused
to
gasp
a
little
 
"
and
<EOS>
I
know
it
's
christened
folks
's
duty
to
submit
to
their
betters
as
fur
as
flesh
and
blood
'
<EOS>
ull
bear
it
;
but
I
'll
not
make
a
martyr
o
'
myself
,
and
wear
myself
to
skin
and
bone
,
and
worret
myself
as
if
I
was
a
churn
wi
'
butter
a
-
coming
in't
,
for
no
landlord
in
England
,
not
if
he
was
King
George
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Poyser
,
certainly
not
,
"
said
the
squire
,
still
confident
in
his
own
powers
of
persuasion
,
"
you
must
not
overwork
yourself
;
but
do
n't
you
think
your
work
will
rather
be
lessened
than
increased
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
There
is
so
much
milk
required
at
the
Abbey
that
you
will
have
little
increase
of
cheese
and
butter
making
from
the
addition
to
your
dairy
;
and
I
believe
selling
the
milk
is
the
most
profitable
way
of
disposing
of
dairy
produce
,
is
it
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
that
's
true
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
unable
to
repress
an
opinion
on
a
question
of
farming
profits
,
and
forgetting
that
it
was
not
in
this
case
a
purely
abstract
question
.
  
<EOS>

I

said
Mrs.
Poyser
bitterly
,
turning
her
head
half
-
way
towards
her
husband

looking
at
the
vacant
arm

chair
 
<EOS>
"
I
daresay
it
's
true
for
men

If

it

easy
getting

<EOS>
How
do
I
know
whether
the

be
wanted
constant
?
<EOS>
What
's
to
make
me
sure
as
the

put

board
<EOS>
wage
afore

we

I
may
have
to
lie
awake

twenty

milk

my

Dingall

lose
half

And
there
's
the

"
That
difficulty
 
about
the
fetching
and
carrying
 
<EOS>
you
will
not
have
,
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
said
the
squire
,
who
thought
that
this
entrance
into
particulars
indicated
a
distant
inclination
to
compromise
on
Mrs.
Poyser
's
part

<EOS>
"
Bethell
will
do
that
regularly
with
the
cart

"
Oh
,
sir
,
begging
your
pardon
,
I
've
never
been
used
t

having
gentlefolks

servants
coming
about
my
back
places
,
a
-
making
love
to
both
the
gells
at
once
and
keeping
'em
with
their
hands
on
their
hips
listening
to
all
manner

gossip
when
they
should
be
down
on

scouring

<EOS>
If
we
're
to
go
to

it
shanna

having
our
back
kitchen
turned
into
a

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Poyser
,
"
said
the
squire
,
shifting
his
tactics
and
looking
as
if
he
thought
Mrs.
Poyser
had
suddenly
withdrawn
from
the
proceedings
and
left
the
room
,
"
you
can
turn
the
Hollows
into
feeding

land

<EOS>
I
can
easily
make
another
arrangement
about

<EOS>
And
I
shall
not
forget
your
readiness

accommodate
your
landlord
as
well
as
a
neighbour

<EOS>
I
know
you
will
be
glad
to
have
your
lease
renewed
for
three
years
,
when
the
present
one
expires
;
otherwise
,
I
daresay
Thurle
,
who
is
a
man
of
some
capital
,
would
be
glad
to
take
both
the
farms
,
as
they
could
be
worked
so
well
together

<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
want

old
tenant

you

"
  
<EOS>
To
be
thrust
out
of
the
discussion
in
this
way
would
have
been
enough
to
complete
Mrs.
Poyser
's
exasperation
,
even
without
the
final
threat
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
really
alarmed
at
the
possibility
of
their
leaving
the
old
place
where
he
had
been
bred
and
born
 
for
he
believed
the
old
squire
had
small
spite
enough
for
anything
 
was
beginning
a
mild
remonstrance
explanatory
of
the
inconvenience
he
should
find
in
having
to
buy
and
sell
more
stock
,
with
,
"
<EOS>
Well

sir
,
I
think
as
it

hard

"
when
Mrs.
Poyser
burst
in
with
the
desperate
determination
to
have
her
say
out
this
once
,
though
it
were
to
rain
notices
to
quit
and
the
only
shelter
were
the
work

house

Then
,
sir
,
if
I
may
speak
 
as

for

I
'm
a

and
there
's
folks
as
thinks
a

's
fool
enough
to

by
an

look
on
while
the

sign
her

I
've
a

<EOS>
for
I
make
one

o

and
save
another
quarter
 
<EOS>
I
say
,
if
Mr.
Thurle
's
so
ready
to
take
farms
under
you
<EOS>

it
's
a
pity
but
what
he
should
take
this

over

alive

I
should
like
to

another

having

See

such
a

here
as
that

a

I

<EOS>
You

continued
Mrs.
Poyser
,
following
the
old
squire
beyond
the
door
 
for
after
the
first
moments
of
stunned
surprise
he
had
got
up
,
and
,
waving
his
hand
towards
her
with
a
smile
,
had
walked
out
towards
his
pony
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
get
away
immediately
,
for
John
was
walking
the
pony
up
and
down
the
yard
,
and
was
some
distance
from
the
causeway
when
his
master
beckoned
.
  
<EOS>

There
are
occasions
on
which
two
servant
-
girls
and
a
waggoner
may
be
a
formidable
audience
,
and
as
the
squire
rode
away
on
his
black
pony
,
even
the
gift
of
short
-
sightedness
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
aware
that
Molly
and
Nancy
and
Tim
were
grinning
not
far
from
him
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
suspected
that
sour
old
John
was
grinning
behind
him
 
which
was
also
the
fact

Meanwhile
the
bull
-
dog
,
the
black

and

tan
terrier
,
Alick
's
sheep
-
dog
,
and
the
gander
hissing
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
pony
's
heels
carried
out
the
idea
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
solo
in
an
impressive
quartet

<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
however
,
had
no
sooner
seen
the
pony
move
off
than
she
turned
round
,
gave
the
two
hilarious
damsels
a
look
which
drove
them
into
the
back
kitchen
,
and
unspearing
her
knitting
,
began
to
knit
again
with
her
usual
rapidity
as
she
re
-
entered
the
house

<EOS>
"
Thee'st
done

said
Mr.
Poyser

a
little
alarmed

uneasy
,

not

triumphant
amusement

Yes

Mr.

rising

walking

THE
barley
was
all
carried
at
last
,
and
the
harvest
suppers
went
by
without
waiting
for
the
dismal
black
crop
of
beans
.
<EOS>
The
apples
and
nuts
were
gathered
and
stored
;
the

Michaelmas
was
come
,
with
its
fragrant
basketfuls
of
purple
damsons
,
and
its
paler
purple
daisies
,
and
its
lads
and
lasses
leaving
or
seeking
service
and
winding
along
between
the
yellow
hedges
,
with
their
bundles
under
their
arms
.
<EOS>
But
though
Michaelmas
was
come
,
Mr.
Thurle
,
that
desirable
tenant
,
did
not
come
to
the
Chase
Farm
,
and
the
old
squire
,
after
all
,
had
been
obliged
to
put
in
a
new
bailiff
.
<EOS>
It
was
known
throughout
the
two
parishes
that
the
squire
's
plan
had
been
frustrated
because
the
Poysers
had
refused
to
be
"
put
upon
,
"
and
Mrs.
Poyser
's
outbreak
was
discussed
in
all
the
farm
-
houses
with
a
zest
which
was
only
heightened
by
frequent
repetition
.
<EOS>
The
news
that
"
Bony
"
was
come
back
from
Egypt
was
comparatively
insipid
,
and
the
repulse
of
the
French
in
Italy
was
nothing
to
Mrs.
Poyser
's
repulse
of
the
old
squire
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
had
heard
a
version
of
it
in
every
parishioner
's
house
,
with
the
one
exception
of
the
Chase
.
<EOS>
But
since
he
had
always
,
with
marvellous
skill
,
avoided
any
quarrel
with
Mr.
Donnithorne
,
he
could
not
allow
himself
the
pleasure
of
laughing
at
the
old
gentleman
's
discomfiture
with
any
one
besides
his
mother
,
who
declared
that
if
she
were
rich
she
should
like
to
allow
Mrs.
Poyser
a
pension
for
life
,
and
wanted
to
invite
her
to
the
parsonage
that
she
might
hear
an
account
of
the
scene
from
Mrs.
Poyser
's
own
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Mother

said
Mr.
Irwine
;
"
it
was
a
little
bit
of
irregular
justice
on

a

not
countenance
irregular
justice

I
like

even

She
has
the
spirit
of

Sharp

<EOS>
Yes

her
tongue
is
like
a

She
's
quite
original
in
her
talk
too

one
of
those
untaught
wits
that
help
to
stock
a
country
with
proverbs

<EOS>
I
told
you
that
capital
thing
I
heard
her
say
about
Craig
 
that
he
was
like
a
cock
,
who
thought
the
sun
had
risen
to
hear
him
crow

Now
that
's
an
AEsop

fable
in
a
sentence

But
it
will
be
a
bad
business
if
the
old
gentleman
turns
them
out
of
the
farm
next
Michaelmas

said
Mrs.
Irwine

<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
must
not
be
;

Poyser

such
a
good

Donnithorne

likely

think
twice

digest
his
spleen
rather

turn

out

But
if
he
should
give
them
notice

the
old
man
was
a
little
shaken
:
he
's
eighty
-
three
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
It
's
really
an
unconscionable
age
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
women
who
have
a
right
to
live
as
long
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
they
've
got
old
-
bachelor
sons
who
would
be
forlorn
without
them
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
laughing
,
and
kissing
his
mother
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
,
too
,
met
her
husband
's
occasional
forebodings
of
a
notice
to
quit
with
"
There
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
before
Lady
day
"
 
one
of
those
undeniable
general
propositions
which
are
usually
intended
to
convey
a
particular
meaning
very
far
from
undeniable
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
really
too
hard
upon
human
nature
that
it
should
be
held
a
criminal
offence
to
imagine
the
death
even
of
the
king
when
he
is
turned
eighty
-
three
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
believed
that
any
but
the
dullest
Britons
can
be
good
subjects
under
that
hard
condition
.
  
<EOS>
Apart
from
this
foreboding
,
things
went
on
much
as
usual
in
the
Poyser
household
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
thought
she
noticed
a
surprising
improvement
in
Hetty
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
the
girl
got
"
closer
tempered
,
and
sometimes
she
seemed
as
if
there
'd
be
no
drawing
a
word
from
her
with
cart
-
ropes
,
"
but
she
thought
much
less
about
her
dress
,
and
went
after
the
work
quite
eagerly
,
without
any
telling
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
wonderful
how
she
never
wanted
to
go
out
now
 
indeed
,
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
go
;
and
she
bore
her
aunt
's
putting
a
stop
to
her
weekly
lesson
in
fine
-
work
at
the
Chase
without
the
least
grumbling
or
pouting
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
,
after
all
,
that
she
had
set
her
heart
on
Adam
at
last
,
and
her
sudden
freak
of
wanting
to
be
a
lady
's
maid
must
have
been
caused
by
some
little
pique
or
misunderstanding
between
them
,
which
had
passed
by
.
<EOS>
For
whenever
Adam
came
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
Hetty
seemed
to
be
in
better
spirits
and
to
talk
more
than
at
other
times
,
though
she
was
almost
sullen
when
Mr.
Craig
or
any
other
admirer
happened
to
pay
a
visit
there
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
himself
watched
her
at
first
with
trembling
anxiety
,
which
gave
way
to
surprise
and
delicious
hope
.
<EOS>
Five
days
after
delivering
Arthur
's
letter
,
he
had
ventured
to
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
again
 
not
without
dread
lest
the
sight
of
him
might
be
painful
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
the
house
-
place
when
he
entered
,
and
he
sat
talking
to
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
for
a
few
minutes
with
a
heavy
fear
on
his
heart
that
they
might
presently
tell
him
Hetty
was
ill
.
<EOS>
But
by
and
by
there
came
a
light
step
that
he
knew
,
and
when
Mrs.
Poyser
said
,
"
Come
,
Hetty
,
where
have
you
been
?
"
<EOS>
Adam
was
obliged
to
turn
round
,
though
he
was
afraid
to
see
the
changed
look
there
must
be
in
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
almost
started
when
he
saw
her
smiling
as
if
she
were
pleased
to
see
him
 
looking
the
same
as
ever
at
a
first
glance
,
only
that
she
had
her
cap
on
,
which
he
had
never
seen
her
in
before
when
he
came
of
an
evening
.
<EOS>
Still
,
when
he
looked
at
her
again
and
again
as
she
moved
about
or
sat
at
her
work
,
there
was
a
change
:
the
cheeks
were
as
pink
as
ever
,
and
she
smiled
as
much
as
she
had
ever
done
of
late
,
but
there
was
something
different
in
her
eyes
,
in
the
expression
of
her
face
,
in
all
her
movements
<EOS>
,
Adam
thought
 
something
harder
,
older
,
less
child
-
like
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
thing
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
himself
,
"
that
's
allays
likely
.
<EOS>
It
's
because
she
's
had
her
first
heartache
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
got
a
spirit
to
bear
up
under
it
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
for
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
weeks
went
by
,
and
he
saw
her
always
looking
pleased
to
see
him
 
turning
up
her
lovely
face
towards
him
as
if
she
meant
him
to
understand
that
she
was
glad
for
him
to
come
 
and
going
about
her
work
in
the
same
equable
way
,
making
no
sign
of
sorrow
<EOS>
,
he
began
to
believe
that
her
feeling
towards
Arthur
must
have
been
much
slighter
than
he
had
imagined
in
his
first
indignation
and
alarm
,
and
that
she
had
been
able
to
think
of
her
girlish
fancy
that
Arthur
was
in
love
with
her
and
would
marry
her
as
a
folly
of
which
she
was
timely
cured
.
<EOS>
And
it
perhaps
was
,
as
he
had
sometimes
in
his
more
cheerful
moments
hoped
it
would
be
 
<EOS>
her
heart
was
really
turning
with
all
the
more
warmth
towards
the
man
she
knew
to
have
a
serious
love
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Possibly
you
think
that
Adam
was
not
at
all
sagacious
in
his
interpretations
,
and
that
it
was
altogether
extremely
unbecoming
in
a
sensible
man
to
behave
as
he
did
 
falling
in
love
with
a
girl
who
really
had
nothing
more
than
her
beauty
to
recommend
her
,
attributing
imaginary
virtues
to
her
,
and
even
condescending
to
cleave
to
her
after
she
had
fallen
in
love
with
another
man
,
waiting
for
her
kind
looks
as
a
patient
trembling
dog
waits
for
his
master
's
eye
to
be
turned
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
in
so
complex
a
thing
as
human
nature
,
we
must
consider
,
it
is
hard
to
find
rules
without
exceptions
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
I
know
that
,
as
a
rule
,
sensible
men
fall
in
love
with
the
most
sensible
women
of
their
acquaintance
,
see
through
all
the
pretty
deceits
of
coquettish
beauty
,
never
imagine
themselves
loved
when
they
are
not
loved
,
cease
loving
on
all
proper
occasions
,
and
marry
the
woman
most
fitted
for
them
in
every
respect
 
indeed
,
so
as
to
compel
the
approbation
of
all
the
maiden
ladies
in
their
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
But
even
to
this
rule
an
exception
will
occur
now
and
then
in
the
lapse
of
centuries
,
and
my
friend
Adam
was
one
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
however
,
I
respect
him
none
the
less
 
nay
,
I
think
the
deep
love
he
had
for
that
sweet
,
rounded
,
blossom
-
like
,
dark
-
eyed
Hetty
,
of
whose
inward
self
he
was
really
very
ignorant
,
came
out
of
the
very
strength
of
his
nature
and
not
out
of
any
inconsistent
weakness
.
<EOS>
Is
it
any
weakness
,
pray
,
to
be
wrought
on
by
exquisite
music
?
<EOS>
To
feel
its
wondrous
harmonies
searching
the
subtlest
windings
of
your
soul
,
the
delicate
fibres
of
life
where
no
memory
can
penetrate
,
and
binding
together
your
whole
being
past
and
present
in
one
unspeakable
vibration
,
melting
you
in
one
moment
with
all
the
tenderness
,
all
the
love
that
has
been
scattered
through
the
toilsome
years
,
concentrating
in
one
emotion
of
heroic
courage
or
resignation
all
the
hard
-
learnt
lessons
of
self
-
renouncing
sympathy
,
blending
your
present
joy
with
past
sorrow
and
your
present
sorrow
with
all
your
past
joy
?
<EOS>
If
not
,
then
neither
is
it
a
weakness
to
be
so
wrought
upon
by
the
exquisite
curves
of
a
woman
's
cheek
and
neck
and
arms
,
by
the
liquid
depths
of
her
beseeching
eyes
,
or
the
sweet
childish
pout
of
her
lips
.
<EOS>
For
the
beauty
of
a
lovely
woman
is
like
music
:
what
can
one
say
more
?
<EOS>
Beauty
has
an
expression
beyond
and
far
above
the
one
woman
's
soul
that
it
clothes
,
as
the
words
of
genius
have
a
wider
meaning
than
the
thought
that
prompted
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
than
a
woman
's
love
that
moves
us
in
a
woman
's
eyes
 
<EOS>
it
seems
to
be
a
far
-
off
mighty
love
that
has
come
near
to
us
,
and
made
speech
for
itself
there
;
the
rounded
neck
,
the
dimpled
arm
,
move
us
by
something
more
than
their
prettiness
 
by
their
close
kinship
with
all
we
have
known
of
tenderness
and
peace
.
<EOS>
The
noblest
nature
sees
the
most
of
this
impersonal
expression
in
beauty
(
it
is
needless
to
say
that
there
are
gentlemen
with
whiskers
dyed
and
undyed
who
see
none
of
it
whatever
)
,
and
for
this
reason
,
the
noblest
nature
is
often
the
most
blinded
to
the
character
of
the
one
woman
's
soul
that
the
beauty
clothes
.
<EOS>
Whence
,
I
fear
,
the
tragedy
of
human
life
is
likely
to
continue
for
a
long
time
to
come
,
in
spite
of
mental
philosophers
who
are
ready
with
the
best
receipts
for
avoiding
all
mistakes
of
the
kind
.
  
<EOS>
Our
good
Adam
had
no
fine
words
into
which
he
could
put
his
feeling
for
Hetty
:
he
could
not
disguise
mystery
in
this
way
with
the
appearance
of
knowledge
;
he
called
his
love
frankly
a
mystery
,
as
you
have
heard
him
.
<EOS>
He
only
knew
that
the
sight
and
memory
of
her
moved
him
deeply
,
touching
the
spring
of
all
love
and
tenderness
,
all
faith
and
courage
within
him
.
<EOS>
How
could
he
imagine
narrowness
,
selfishness
,
hardness
in
her
?
<EOS>
He
created
the
mind
he
believed
in
out
of
his
own
,
which
was
large
,
unselfish
,
tender
.
  
<EOS>
The
hopes
he
felt
about
Hetty
softened
a
little
his
feeling
towards
Arthur
.
<EOS>
Surely
his
attentions
to
Hetty
must
have
been
of
a
slight
kind
;
they
were
altogether
wrong
,
and
such
as
no
man
in
Arthur
's
position
ought
to
have
allowed
himself
,
but
they
must
have
had
an
air
of
playfulness
about
them
,
which
had
probably
blinded
him
to
their
danger
and
had
prevented
them
from
laying
any
strong
hold
on
Hetty
's
heart
.
<EOS>
As
the
new
promise
of
happiness
rose
for
Adam
,
his
indignation
and
jealousy
began
to
die
out
.
<EOS>
Hetty
was
not
made
unhappy
;
he
almost
believed
that
she
liked
him
best
;
and
the
thought
sometimes
crossed
his
mind
that
the
friendship
which
had
once
seemed
dead
for
ever
might
revive
in
the
days
to
come
,
and
he
would
not
have
to
say
"
good
-
bye
"
to
the
grand
old
woods
,
but
would
like
them
better
because
they
were
Arthur
's
.
<EOS>
For
this
new
promise
of
happiness
following
so
quickly
on
the
shock
of
pain
had
an
intoxicating
effect
on
the
sober
Adam
,
who
had
all
his
life
been
used
to
much
hardship
and
moderate
hope
.
<EOS>
Was
he
really
going
to
have
an
easy
lot
after
all
?
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
,
for
at
the
beginning
of
November
,
Jonathan
Burge
,
finding
it
impossible
to
replace
Adam
,
had
at
last
made
up
his
mind
to
offer
him
a
share
in
the
business
,
without
further
condition
than
that
he
should
continue
to
give
his
energies
to
it
and
renounce
all
thought
of
having
a
separate
business
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
Son
-
in
-
law
or
no
son
-
in
-
law
,
Adam
had
made
himself
too
necessary
to
be
parted
with
,
and
his
headwork
was
so
much
more
important
to
Burge
than
his
skill
in
handicraft
that
his
having
the
management
of
the
woods
made
little
difference
in
the
value
of
his
services
;
and
as
to
the
bargains
about
the
squire
's
timber
,
it
would
be
easy
to
call
in
a
third
person
.
<EOS>
Adam
saw
here
an
opening
into
a
broadening
path
of
prosperous
work
such
as
he
had
thought
of
with
ambitious
longing
ever
since
he
was
a
lad
:
he
might
come
to
build
a
bridge
,
or
a
town
hall
,
or
a
factory
,
for
he
had
always
said
to
himself
that
Jonathan
Burge
's
building
business
was
like
an
acorn
,
which
might
be
the
mother
of
a
great
tree
.
<EOS>
So
he
gave
his
hand
to
Burge
on
that
bargain
,
and
went
home
with
his
mind
full
of
happy
visions
,
in
which
(
my
refined
reader
will
perhaps
be
shocked
when
I
say
it
)
<EOS>
the
image
of
Hetty
hovered
,
and
smiled
over
plans
for
seasoning
timber
at
a
trifling
expense
,
calculations
as
to
the
cheapening
of
bricks
per
thousand
by
water
-
carriage
,
and
a
favourite
scheme
for
the
strengthening
of
roofs
and
walls
with
a
peculiar
form
of
iron
girder
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
<EOS>
Adam
's
enthusiasm
lay
in
these
things
;
and
our
love
is
inwrought
in
our
enthusiasm
as
electricity
is
inwrought
in
the
air
,
exalting
its
power
by
a
subtle
presence
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
would
be
able
to
take
a
separate
house
now
,
and
provide
for
his
mother
in
the
old
one
;
his
prospects
would
justify
his
marrying
very
soon
,
and
if
Dinah
consented
to
have
Seth
,
their
mother
would
perhaps
be
more
contented
to
live
apart
from
Adam
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
be
hasty
 
<EOS>
he
would
not
try
Hetty
's
feeling
for
him
until
it
had
had
time
to
grow
strong
and
firm
.
<EOS>
However
,
tomorrow
,
after
church
,
he
would
go
to
the
Hall
Farm
and
tell
them
the
news
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
,
he
knew
,
would
like
it
better
than
a
five
-
pound
note
,
and
he
should
see
if
Hetty
's
eyes
brightened
at
it
.
<EOS>
The
months
would
be
short
with
all
he
had
to
fill
his
mind
,
and
this
foolish
eagerness
which
had
come
over
him
of
late
must
not
hurry
him
into
any
premature
words
.
<EOS>
Yet
when
he
got
home
and
told
his
mother
the
good
news
,
and
ate
his
supper
,
while
she
sat
by
almost
crying
for
joy
and
wanting
him
to
eat
twice
as
much
as
usual
because
of
this
good
-
luck
,
he
could
not
help
preparing
her
gently
for
the
coming
change
by
talking
of
the
old
house
being
too
small
for
them
all
to
go
on
living
in
it
always
.
    
<EOS>
The
Betrothal
  
<EOS>
IT
was
a
dry
Sunday
,
and
really
a
pleasant
day
for
the
2d
of
November
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
sunshine
,
but
the
clouds
were
high
,
and
the
wind
was
so
still
that
the
yellow
leaves
which
fluttered
down
from
the
hedgerow
elms
must
have
fallen
from
pure
decay
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mrs.
Poyser
did
not
go
to
church
,
for
she
had
taken
a
cold
too
serious
to
be
neglected
;
only
two
winters
ago
she
had
been
laid
up
for
weeks
with
a
cold
;
and
since
his
wife
did
not
go
to
church
,
Mr.
Poyser
considered
that
on
the
whole
it
would
be
as
well
for
him
to
stay
away
too
and
"
keep
her
company
.
<EOS>
"
He
could
perhaps
have
given
no
precise
form
to
the
reasons
that
determined
this
conclusion
,
but
it
is
well
known
to
all
experienced
minds
that
our
firmest
convictions
are
often
dependent
on
subtle
impressions
for
which
words
are
quite
too
coarse
a
medium
.
<EOS>
However
it
was
,
no
one
from
the
Poyser
family
went
to
church
that
afternoon
except
Hetty
and
the
boys
;
yet
Adam
was
bold
enough
to
join
them
after
church
,
and
say
that
he
would
walk
home
with
them
,
though
all
the
way
through
the
village
he
appeared
to
be
chiefly
occupied
with
Marty
and
Tommy
,
telling
them
about
the
squirrels
in
Binton
Coppice
,
and
promising
to
take
them
there
some
day
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
came
to
the
fields
he
said
to
the
boys
,
"
Now
,
then
,
which
is
the
stoutest
walker
?
<EOS>
Him
as
gets
to
th
'
home
-
gate
first
shall
be
the
first
to
go
with
me
to
Binton
Coppice
on
the
donkey
.
<EOS>
But
Tommy
must
have
the
start
up
to
the
next
stile
,
because
he
's
the
smallest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
never
behaved
so
much
like
a
determined
lover
before
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
boys
had
both
set
off
,
he
looked
down
at
Hetty
and
said
,
"
Wo
n't
you
hang
on
my
arm
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
"
in
a
pleading
tone
,
as
if
he
had
already
asked
her
and
she
had
refused
.
<EOS>
Hetty
looked
up
at
him
smilingly
and
put
her
round
arm
through
his
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
It
was
nothing
to
her
,
putting
her
arm
through
Adam
's
,
but
she
knew
he
cared
a
great
deal
about
having
her
arm
through
his
,
and
she
wished
him
to
care
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
beat
no
faster
,
and
she
looked
at
the
half
-
bare
hedgerows
and
the
ploughed
field
with
the
same
sense
of
oppressive
dulness
as
before
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
scarcely
felt
that
he
was
walking
.
<EOS>
He
thought
Hetty
must
know
that
he
was
pressing
her
arm
a
little
 
a
very
little
.
<EOS>
Words
rushed
to
his
lips
that
he
dared
not
utter
 
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
not
to
utter
yet
 
<EOS>
and
so
he
was
silent
for
the
length
of
that
field
.
<EOS>
The
calm
patience
with
which
he
had
once
waited
for
Hetty
's
love
,
content
only
with
her
presence
and
the
thought
of
the
future
,
had
forsaken
him
since
that
terrible
shock
nearly
three
months
ago
.
<EOS>
The
agitations
of
jealousy
had
given
a
new
restlessness
to
his
passion
 
had
made
fear
and
uncertainty
too
hard
almost
to
bear
.
<EOS>
But
though
he
might
not
speak
to
Hetty
of
his
love
,
he
would
tell
her
about
his
new
prospects
and
see
if
she
would
be
pleased
.
<EOS>
So
when
he
was
enough
master
of
himself
to
talk
,
he
said
,
"
I
'm
going
to
tell
your
uncle
some
news
that
'll
surprise
him
,
Hetty
;
and
I
think
he
'll
be
glad
to
hear
it
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
Hetty
said
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Mr.
Burge
has
offered
me
a
share
in
his
business
,
and
I
'm
going
to
take
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
change
in
Hetty
's
face
,
certainly
not
produced
by
any
agreeable
impression
from
this
news
.
<EOS>
In
fact
she
felt
a
momentary
annoyance
and
alarm
,
for
she
had
so
often
heard
it
hinted
by
her
uncle
that
Adam
might
have
Mary
Burge
and
a
share
in
the
business
any
day
,
if
he
liked
,
that
she
associated
the
two
objects
now
,
and
the
thought
immediately
occurred
that
perhaps
Adam
had
given
her
up
because
of
what
had
happened
lately
,
and
had
turned
towards
Mary
Burge
.
<EOS>
With
that
thought
,
and
before
she
had
time
to
remember
any
reasons
why
it
could
not
be
true
,
came
a
new
sense
of
forsakenness
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
The
one
thing
 
the
one
person
 
<EOS>
her
mind
had
rested
on
in
its
dull
weariness
,
had
slipped
away
from
her
,
and
peevish
misery
filled
her
eyes
with
tears
.
<EOS>
She
was
looking
on
the
ground
,
but
Adam
saw
her
face
,
saw
the
tears
,
and
before
he
had
finished
saying
,
"
Hetty
,
dear
Hetty
,
what
are
you
crying
for
?
"
<EOS>
his
eager
rapid
thought
had
flown
through
all
the
causes
conceivable
to
him
,
and
had
at
last
alighted
on
half
the
true
one
.
<EOS>
Hetty
thought
he
was
going
to
marry
Mary
Burge
 
<EOS>
she
did
n't
like
him
to
marry
 
<EOS>
perhaps
she
did
n't
like
him
to
marry
any
one
but
herself
?
<EOS>
All
caution
was
swept
away
 
all
reason
for
it
was
gone
,
and
Adam
could
feel
nothing
but
trembling
joy
.
<EOS>
He
leaned
towards
her
and
took
her
hand
,
as
he
said
:
  
"
I
could
afford
to
be
married
now
,
Hetty
 
I
could
make
a
wife
comfortable
;
but
I
shall
never
want
to
be
married
if
you
wo
n't
have
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
through
her
tears
,
as
she
had
done
to
Arthur
that
first
evening
in
the
wood
,
when
she
had
thought
he
was
not
coming
,
and
yet
he
came
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
feebler
relief
,
a
feebler
triumph
she
felt
now
,
but
the
great
dark
eyes
and
the
sweet
lips
were
as
beautiful
as
ever
,
perhaps
more
beautiful
<EOS>
,
for
there
was
a
more
luxuriant
womanliness
about
Hetty
of
late
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
hardly
believe
in
the
happiness
of
that
moment
.
<EOS>
His
right
hand
held
her
left
,
and
he
pressed
her
arm
close
against
his
heart
as
he
leaned
down
towards
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
love
me
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
my
own
wife
,
to
love
and
take
care
of
as
long
as
I
live
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
did
not
speak
,
but
Adam
's
face
was
very
close
to
hers
,
and
she
put
up
her
round
cheek
against
his
,
like
a
kitten
.
<EOS>
She
wanted
to
be
caressed
 
<EOS>
she
wanted
to
feel
as
if
Arthur
were
with
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
cared
for
no
words
after
that
,
and
they
hardly
spoke
through
the
rest
of
the
walk
.
<EOS>
He
only
said
,
"
I
may
tell
your
uncle
and
aunt
,
may
n't
I
,
Hetty
?
"
<EOS>
and
she
said
,
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
red
fire
-
light
on
the
hearth
at
the
Hall
Farm
shone
on
joyful
faces
that
evening
,
when
Hetty
was
gone
upstairs
and
Adam
took
the
opportunity
of
telling
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
and
the
grandfather
that
he
saw
his
way
to
maintaining
a
wife
now
,
and
that
Hetty
had
consented
to
have
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
have
no
objections
against
me
for
her
husband
,
"
said
Adam
;
"
I
'm
a
poor
man
as
yet
,
but
she
shall
want
nothing
as
I
can
work
for
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Objections
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
while
the
grandfather
leaned
forward
and
brought
out
his
long
"
Nay
,
nay
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
objections
can
we
ha
'
to
you
,
lad
?
<EOS>
Never
mind
your
being
poorish
as
yet
;
there
's
money
in
your
head
-
piece
as
there
's
money
<EOS>
i
'
the
sown
field
,
but
it
must
ha
'
time
.
<EOS>
You'n
got
enough
to
begin
on
,
and
we
can
do
a
deal
tow'rt
the
bit
<EOS>
o
'
furniture
you
'll
want
.
<EOS>
Thee'st
got
feathers
and
linen
to
spare
 
plenty
,
eh
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
question
was
of
course
addressed
to
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
wrapped
up
in
a
warm
shawl
and
was
too
hoarse
to
speak
with
her
usual
facility
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
only
nodded
emphatically
,
but
she
was
presently
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
to
be
more
explicit
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
ud
be
a
poor
tale
if
I
hadna
feathers
and
linen
,
"
she
said
,
hoarsely
,
"
when
I
never
sell
a
fowl
but
what
's
plucked
,
and
the
wheel
's
a
-
going
every
day
<EOS>
o
'
the
week
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
my
wench
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
when
Hetty
came
down
,
"
come
and
kiss
us
,
and
let
us
wish
you
luck
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
went
very
quietly
and
kissed
the
big
good
-
natured
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
said
,
patting
her
on
the
back
,
"
go
and
kiss
your
aunt
and
your
grandfather
.
<EOS>
I
'm
as
wishful
t
<EOS>
'
have
you
settled
well
as
if
you
was
my
own
daughter
;
and
so
's
your
aunt
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
for
she
's
done
by
you
this
seven
'
ear
,
Hetty
,
as
if
you
'd
been
her
own
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
now
<EOS>
,
"
he
went
on
,
becoming
jocose
,
as
soon
as
Hetty
had
kissed
her
aunt
and
the
old
man
,
"
<EOS>
Adam
wants
a
kiss
too
,
I
'll
warrant
,
and
he
's
a
right
to
one
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
turned
away
,
smiling
,
towards
her
empty
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Adam
,
then
,
take
one
,
"
persisted
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
else
<EOS>
y
'
arena
half
a
man
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
got
up
,
blushing
like
a
small
maiden
 
<EOS>
great
strong
fellow
as
he
was
 
and
,
putting
his
arm
<EOS>
round
Hetty
stooped
down
and
gently
kissed
her
lips
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
pretty
scene
in
the
red
fire
-
light
;
for
there
were
no
candles
 
<EOS>
why
should
there
be
,
when
the
fire
was
so
bright
and
was
reflected
from
all
the
pewter
and
the
polished
oak
?
<EOS>
No
one
wanted
to
work
on
a
Sunday
evening
.
<EOS>
Even
Hetty
felt
something
like
contentment
in
the
midst
of
all
this
love
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
attachment
to
her
,
Adam
's
caress
,
stirred
no
passion
in
her
,
were
no
longer
enough
to
satisfy
her
vanity
,
but
they
were
the
best
her
life
offered
her
now
 
<EOS>
they
promised
her
some
change
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
great
deal
of
discussion
before
Adam
went
away
,
about
the
possibility
of
his
finding
a
house
that
would
do
for
him
to
settle
in
.
<EOS>
No
house
was
empty
except
the
one
next
to
Will
Maskery
's
in
the
village
,
and
that
was
too
small
for
Adam
now
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
insisted
that
the
best
plan
would
be
for
Seth
and
his
mother
to
move
and
leave
Adam
in
the
old
home
,
which
might
be
enlarged
after
a
while
,
for
there
was
plenty
of
space
in
the
woodyard
and
garden
;
but
Adam
objected
to
turning
his
mother
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
at
last
,
"
we
needna
fix
everything
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
We
must
take
time
to
consider
.
<EOS>
You
canna
think
o
'
getting
married
<EOS>
afore
Easter
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
for
long
courtships
,
but
there
must
be
a
bit
o
'
time
to
make
things
comfortable
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
to
be
sure
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
;
"
Christian
folks
ca
n't
be
married
like
cuckoos
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
a
bit
daunted
,
though
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
when
I
think
as
we
may
have
notice
to
quit
,
and
belike
be
forced
to
take
a
farm
twenty
mile
off
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
staring
at
the
floor
and
lifting
his
hands
up
and
down
,
while
his
arms
rested
on
the
elbows
of
his
chair
,
"
it
's
a
poor
tale
if
I
mun
leave
th
'
ould
spot
an

buried
in
a
strange
parish

<EOS>
An
'
you

"
he
added
,
looking
up
at
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
thee
mustna
fret
beforehand
,
father
,
"
said
Martin
the
younger
.
<EOS>
"
Happen

<EOS>
I

I

"
    
<EOS>
The
Hidden
Dread
  
<EOS>
IT
was
a
busy
time
for
Adam
 
<EOS>
the
time
between
the
beginning
of
November
and
the
beginning
of
February
,
and
he
could
see
little
of
Hetty
,
except
on
Sundays
.
<EOS>
But
a
happy
time
,
nevertheless
,
for
it
was
taking
him
nearer
and
nearer
to
March
,
when
they
were
to
be
married
,
and
all
the
little
preparations
for
their
new
housekeeping
marked
the
progress
towards
the
longed
-
for
day
.
<EOS>
Two
new
rooms
had
been
"
run
up
"
to
the
old
house
,
for
his
mother
and
Seth
were
to
live
with
them
after
all
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
had
cried
so
piteously
at
the
thought
of
leaving
Adam
that
he
had
gone
to
Hetty
and
asked
her
if
,
for
the
love
of
him
,
she
would
put
up
with
his
mother
's
ways
and
consent
to
live
with
her
.
<EOS>
To
his
great
delight
,
Hetty
said
,
"
Yes
;
I
'd
as
soon
she
lived
with
us
as
not
.
"
<EOS>
Hetty
's
mind
was
oppressed
at
that
moment
with
a
worse
difficulty
than
poor
Lisbeth
's
ways
;
she
could
not
care
about
them
.
<EOS>
So
Adam
was
consoled
for
the
disappointment
he
had
felt
when
Seth
had
come
back
from
his
visit
to
Snowfield
and
said
"
it
was
no
use
 
<EOS>
Dinah
's
heart
wasna
turned
towards
marrying
.
<EOS>
"
For
when
he
told
his
mother
that
Hetty
was
willing
they
should
all
live
together
and
there
was
no
more
need
of
them
to
think
of
parting
,
she
said
,
in
a
more
contented
tone
than
he
had
heard
her
speak
in
since
it
had
been
settled
that
he
was
to
be
married
,
"
Eh
,
my
lad
,
I
'll
be
as
still
as
th
'
ould
tabby
,
an
'
ne'er
want
to
do
aught
but

offal

as

An

"
  
<EOS>
There
was
only
one
cloud
that
now
and
then
came
across
Adam
's
sunshine
:
Hetty
seemed
unhappy
sometimes
.
<EOS>
But
to
all
his
anxious
,
tender
questions
,
she
replied
with
an
assurance
that
she
was
quite
contented
and
wished
nothing
different
;
and
the
next
time
he
saw
her
she
was
more
lively
than
usual
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
that
she
was
a
little
overdone
with
work
and
anxiety
now
,
for
soon
after
Christmas
Mrs.
Poyser
had
taken
another
cold
,
which
had
brought
on
inflammation
,
and
this
illness
had
confined
her
to
her
room
all
through
January
.
<EOS>
Hetty
had
to
manage
everything
downstairs
,
and
half
-
supply
<EOS>
Molly
's
place
too
,
while
that
good
damsel
waited
on
her
mistress
,
and
<EOS>
she
seemed
to
throw
herself
so
entirely
into
her
new
functions
,
working
with
a
grave
steadiness
which
was
new
in
her
,
that
Mr.
Poyser
often
told
Adam
she
was
wanting
to
show
him
what
a
good
housekeeper
he
would
have
;
but
he
"
doubted
the
lass
was
<EOS>
o'erdoing
it
 
<EOS>
she
must
have
a
bit
o
'
rest
when
her
aunt
could
come
downstairs
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
desirable
event
of
Mrs.
Poyser
's
coming
downstairs
happened
in
the
early
part
of
February
,
when
some
mild
weather
thawed
the
last
patch
of
snow
on
the
Binton
Hills
.
<EOS>
On
one
of
these
days
,
soon
after
her
aunt
came
down
,
Hetty
went
to
Treddleston
to
buy
some
of
the
wedding
things
which
were
wanting
,
and
which
Mrs.
Poyser
had
scolded
her
for
neglecting
,
observing
that
she
supposed
"
it
was
because
they
were
not
for
th
'
outside
,
else
she
'd
ha
'
bought
'em
fast
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
about
ten
o'clock
when
Hetty
set
off
,
and
the
slight
hoar
-
frost
that
had
whitened
the
hedges
in
the
early
morning
had
disappeared
as
the
sun
mounted
the
cloudless
sky
.
<EOS>
Bright
February
days
have
a
stronger
charm
of
hope
about
them
than
any
other
days
in
the
year
.
<EOS>
One
likes
to
pause
in
the
mild
rays
of
the
sun
,
and
look
over
the
gates
at
the
patient
plough
-
horses
turning
at
the
end
of
the
furrow
,
and
think
that
the
beautiful
year
is
all
before
one
.
<EOS>
The
birds
seem
to
feel
just
the
same
:
their
notes
are
as
clear
as
the
clear
air
.
<EOS>
There
are
no
leaves
on
the
trees
and
hedgerows
,
but
how
green
all
the
grassy
fields
are
!
<EOS>
And
the
dark
purplish
brown
of
the
ploughed
earth
and
of
the
bare
branches
is
beautiful
too
.
<EOS>
What
a
glad
world
this
looks
like
,
as
one
drives
or
rides
along
the
valleys
and
over
the
hills
!
<EOS>
I
have
often
thought
so
when
,
in
foreign
countries
,
where
the
fields
and
woods
have
looked
to
me
like
<EOS>
our
English
Loamshire
 
<EOS>
the
rich
land
tilled
with
just
as
much
care
,
the
woods
rolling
down
the
gentle
slopes
to
the
green
meadows
 
<EOS>
I
have
come
on
something
by
the
roadside
which
has
reminded
me
that
I
am
not
in
Loamshire
:
an
image
of
a
great
agony
 
the
agony
of
the
Cross
.
<EOS>
It
has
stood
perhaps
by
the
clustering
apple
-
blossoms
,
or
in
the
broad
sunshine
by
the
cornfield
,
or
at
a
turning
by
the
wood
where
a
clear
brook
was
gurgling
below
;
and
surely
,
if
there
came
a
traveller
to
this
world
who
knew
nothing
of
the
story
of
man
's
life
upon
it
,
this
image
of
agony
would
seem
to
him
strangely
out
of
place
in
the
midst
of
this
joyous
nature
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
know
that
hidden
behind
the
apple
-
blossoms
,
or
among
the
golden
corn
,
or
under
the
shrouding
boughs
of
the
wood
,
there
might
be
a
human
heart
beating
heavily
with
anguish
 
<EOS>
perhaps
a
young
blooming
girl
,
not
knowing
where
to
turn
for
refuge
from
swift
-
advancing
shame
,
understanding
no
more
of
this
life
of
ours
than
a
foolish
lost
lamb
wandering
farther
and
farther
in
the
nightfall
on
the
lonely
heath
,
yet
tasting
the
bitterest
of
life
's
bitterness
.
  
<EOS>
Such
things
are
sometimes
hidden
among
the
sunny
fields
and
behind
the
blossoming
orchards
;
and
the
sound
of
the
gurgling
brook
,
if
you
came
close
to
one
spot
behind
a
small
bush
,
would
be
mingled
for
your
ear
with
a
despairing
human
sob
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
man
's
religion
has
much
sorrow
in
it
:
no
wonder
he
needs
a
suffering
God
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
,
in
her
red
cloak
and
warm
bonnet
,
with
her
basket
in
her
hand
,
is
turning
towards
a
gate
by
the
side
of
the
Treddleston
road
,
but
not
that
she
may
have
a
more
lingering
enjoyment
of
the
sunshine
and
think
with
hope
of
the
long
unfolding
year
.
<EOS>
She
hardly
knows
that
the
sun
is
shining
;
and
for
weeks
,
now
,
when
she
has
hoped
at
all
,
it
has
been
for
something
at
which
she
herself
trembles
and
shudders
.
<EOS>
She
only
wants
to
be
out
of
the
high
-
road
,
that
she
may
walk
slowly
and
not
care
how
her
face
looks
,
as
she
dwells
on
wretched
thoughts
;
and
through
this
gate
she
can
get
into
a
field
-
path
behind
the
wide
thick
hedgerows
.
<EOS>
Her
great
dark
eyes
wander
blankly
over
the
fields
like
the
eyes
of
one
who
is
desolate
,
homeless
,
unloved
,
not
the
promised
bride
of
a
brave
tender
man
.
<EOS>
But
there
are
no
tears
in
them
<EOS>
:
her
tears
were
all
wept
away
in
the
weary
night
,
before
she
went
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
At
the
next
stile
the
pathway
branches
off
:
there
are
two
roads
before
her
 
one
along
by
the
hedgerow
,
which
will
by
and
by
lead
her
into
the
road
again
,
the
other
across
the
fields
,
which
will
take
her
much
farther
out
of
the
way
into
the
Scantlands
,
low
shrouded
pastures
where
she
will
see
nobody
.
<EOS>
She
chooses
this
and
begins
to
walk
a
little
faster
,
as
if
she
had
suddenly
thought
of
an
object
towards
which
it
was
worth
while
to
hasten
.
<EOS>
Soon
she
is
in
the
Scantlands
,
where
the
grassy
land
slopes
gradually
downwards
,
and
she
leaves
the
level
ground
to
follow
the
slope
.
<EOS>
Farther
on
there
is
a
clump
of
trees
on
the
low
ground
,
and
she
is
making
her
way
towards
it
.
<EOS>
No
,
it
is
not
a
clump
of
trees
,
but
a
dark
shrouded
pool
,
so
full
with
the
wintry
rains
that
the
under
boughs
of
the
elder
-
bushes
lie
low
beneath
the
water
.
<EOS>
She
sits
down
on
the
grassy
bank
,
against
the
stooping
stem
of
the
great
oak
that
hangs
over
the
dark
pool
.
<EOS>
She
has
thought
of
this
pool
often
in
the
nights
of
the
month
that
has
just
gone
by
,
and
now
at
last
she
is
come
to
see
it
.
<EOS>
She
clasps
her
hands
round
her
knees
,
and
leans
forward
,
and
looks
earnestly
at
it
,
as
if
trying
to
guess
what
sort
of
bed
it
would
make
for
her
young
round
limbs
.
  
<EOS>
No
,
she
has
not
courage
to
jump
into
that
cold
watery
bed
,
and
if
she
had
,
they
might
find
her
 
they
might
find
out
why
she
had
drowned
herself
.
<EOS>
There
is
but
one
thing
left
to
her
:
she
must
go
away
,
go
where
they
ca
n't
find
her
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
first
on
-
coming
of
her
great
dread
,
some
weeks
after
her
betrothal
to
Adam
,
she
had
waited
and
waited
,
in
the
blind
vague
<EOS>
hope
that
something
would
happen
to
set
her
free
from
her
terror
;
but
she
could
wait
no
longer
.
<EOS>
All
the
force
of
her
nature
had
been
concentrated
on
the
one
effort
of
concealment
,
and
she
had
shrunk
with
irresistible
dread
from
every
course
that
could
tend
towards
a
betrayal
of
her
miserable
secret
.
<EOS>
Whenever
the
thought
of
writing
to
Arthur
had
occurred
to
her
,
she
had
rejected
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
do
nothing
for
her
that
would
shelter
her
from
discovery
and
scorn
among
the
relatives
and
neighbours
who
once
more
made
all
her
world
,
now
her
airy
dream
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
Her
imagination
no
longer
saw
happiness
with
Arthur
,
for
he
could
do
nothing
that
would
satisfy
or
soothe
her
pride
.
<EOS>
No
,
something
else
would
happen
 
something
must
happen
 
to
set
her
free
from
this
dread
.
<EOS>
In
young
,
childish
,
ignorant
souls
there
is
constantly
this
blind
trust
in
some
unshapen
chance
:
it
is
as
hard
to
a
boy
or
girl
to
believe
that
a
great
wretchedness
will
actually
befall
them
as
to
believe
that
they
will
die
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
necessity
was
pressing
hard
upon
her
 
now
<EOS>
the
time
of
her
marriage
was
close
at
hand
 
<EOS>
she
could
no
longer
rest
in
this
blind
trust
.
<EOS>
She
must
run
away
;
she
must
hide
herself
where
no
familiar
eyes
could
detect
her
;
and
then
the
terror
of
wandering
out
into
the
world
,
of
which
she
knew
nothing
,
made
the
possibility
of
going
to
Arthur
a
thought
which
brought
some
comfort
with
it
.
<EOS>
She
felt
so
helpless
now
,
so
unable
to
fashion
the
future
for
herself
,
that
the
prospect
of
throwing
herself
on
him
had
a
relief
in
it
which
was
stronger
than
her
pride
.
<EOS>
As
she
sat
by
the
pool
and
shuddered
at
the
dark
cold
water
,
the
hope
that
he
would
receive
her
tenderly
 
that
he
would
care
for
her
and
think
for
her
 
was
like
a
sense
of
lulling
warmth
,
that
made
her
for
the
moment
indifferent
to
everything
else
;
and
she
began
now
to
think
of
nothing
but
the
scheme
by
which
she
should
get
away
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
had
a
letter
from
Dinah
lately
,
full
of
kind
words
about
the
coming
marriage
,
which
she
had
heard
of
from
Seth
;
and
when
Hetty
had
read
this
letter
aloud
to
her
uncle
,
he
had
said
,
"
I
wish
Dinah
'
ud
come
again
now
,
for
she
'd
be
a
comfort
to
your
aunt
when
you
're
gone
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
,
my
wench
,
o
'
going
to
see
her
as
soon
as
you
can
be
spared
and
persuading
her
to
come
back
wi
'
you
?
<EOS>
You
might
happen
persuade
her
wi
'
telling
her
as
her
aunt
wants
her
,
for
all
she
writes
o
'
not
being
able
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hetty
had
not
liked
the
thought
of
going
to
Snowfield
,
and
felt
no
longing
to
see
Dinah
,
so
she
only
said
,
"
It
's
so
far
off
,
Uncle
.
"
<EOS>
But
now
she
thought
this
proposed
visit
would
serve
as
a
pretext
for
going
away
.
<EOS>
She
would
tell
her
aunt
when
she
got
home
again
that
she
should
like
the
change
of
going
to
Snowfield
for
a
week
or
ten
days
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
when
she
got
to
Stoniton
,
where
nobody
knew
her
,
she
would
ask
for
the
coach
that
would
take
her
on
the
way
to
Windsor
.
<EOS>
Arthur
was
at
Windsor
,
and
she
would
go
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Hetty
had
determined
on
this
scheme
,
she
rose
from
the
grassy
bank
of
the
pool
,
took
up
her
basket
,
and
went
on
her
way
to
Treddleston
,
for
she
must
buy
the
wedding
things
she
had
come
out
for
,
though
she
would
never
want
them
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
careful
not
to
raise
any
suspicion
that
she
was
going
to
run
away
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
was
quite
agreeably
surprised
that
Hetty
wished
to
go
and
see
Dinah
and
try
to
bring
her
back
to
stay
over
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
The
sooner
she
went
the
better
,
since
the
weather
was
pleasant
now
;
and
Adam
,
when
he
came
in
the
evening
,
said
,
if
Hetty
could
set
off
to
-
morrow
,
he
would
make
time
to
go
with
her
to
Treddleston
and
see
her
safe
into
the
Stoniton
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
go
with
you
and
take
care
of
you
,
Hetty
,
"
he
said
,
the
next
morning
,
leaning
in
at
the
coach
door
;
"
but
you
wo
n't
stay
much
beyond
a
week
 
the
time
'
ull
seem
long
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
looking
at
her
fondly
,
and
his
strong
hand
held
hers
in
its
grasp
.
<EOS>
Hetty
felt
a
sense
of
protection
in
his
presence
 
she
was
used
to
it
now
:
if
she
could
have
had
the
past
undone
and
known
no
other
love
than
her
quiet
liking
for
Adam
!
<EOS>
The
tears
rose
as
she
gave
him
the
last
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
her
for
loving
me
,
"
said
Adam
,
as
he
went
on
his
way
to
work
again
,
with
Gyp
at
his
heels
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hetty
's
tears
were
not
for
Adam
 
not
for
the
anguish
that
would
come
upon
him
when
he
found
she
was
gone
from
him
for
ever
.
<EOS>
They
were
for
the
misery
of
her
own
lot
,
which
took
her
away
from
this
brave
tender
man
who
offered
up
his
whole
life
to
her
,
and
threw
her
,
a
poor
helpless
suppliant
,
on
the
man
who
would
think
it
a
misfortune
that
she
was
obliged
to
cling
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
that
day
,
when
Hetty
was
on
the
coach
that
was
to
take
her
,
they
said
,
to
Leicester
 
part
of
the
long
,
long
way
to
Windsor
 
<EOS>
she
felt
dimly
that
she
might
be
travelling
all
this
weary
journey
towards
the
beginning
of
new
misery
.
  
<EOS>
Yet
Arthur
was
at
Windsor
;
he
would
surely
not
be
angry
with
her
.
<EOS>
If
he
did
not
mind
about
her
as
he
used
to
do
,
he
had
promised
to
be
good
to
her
.
      
<EOS>
The
Journey
of
Hope
  
<EOS>
A
LONG
,
lonely
journey
,
with
sadness
in
the
heart
;
away
from
the
familiar
to
the
strange
:
that
is
a
hard
and
dreary
thing
even
to
the
rich
,
the
strong
,
the
instructed
;
a
hard
thing
,
even
when
we
are
called
by
duty
,
not
urged
by
dread
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
it
then
to
Hetty
?
<EOS>
With
her
poor
narrow
thoughts
,
no
longer
melting
into
vague
hopes
,
but
pressed
upon
by
the
chill
of
definite
fear
,
repeating
again
and
again
the
same
small
round
of
memories
 
shaping
again
and
again
the
same
childish
,
doubtful
images
of
what
was
to
come
 
seeing
nothing
in
this
wide
world
but
the
little
history
of
her
own
pleasures
and
pains
;
with
so
little
money
in
her
pocket
,
and
the
way
so
long
and
difficult
.
<EOS>
Unless
she
could
afford
always
to
go
in
the
coaches
 
<EOS>
and
she
felt
sure
she
could
not
,
for
the
journey
to
Stoniton
was
more
expensive
than
she
had
expected
 
<EOS>
it
was
plain
that
she
must
trust
to
carriers
'
carts
or
slow
waggons
;
and
what
a
time
it
would
be
before
she
could
get
to
the
end
of
her
journey
!
<EOS>
The
burly
old
coachman
from
Oakbourne
,
seeing
such
a
pretty
young
woman
among
the
outside
passengers
,
had
invited
her
to
come
and
sit
beside
him
;
and
feeling
that
it
became
him
as
a
man
and
a
coachman
to
open
the
dialogue
with
a
joke
,
he
applied
himself
as
soon
as
they
were
off
the
stones
to
the
elaboration
of
one
suitable
in
all
respects
.
<EOS>
After
many
cuts
with
his
whip
and
glances
at
Hetty
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
,
he
lifted
his
lips
above
the
edge
of
his
wrapper
and
said
,
"
He
's
pretty
nigh
six
foot
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
isna
he
,
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
?
"
said
Hetty
,
rather
startled
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
sweetheart
as
you
've
left
behind
,
or
else
him
as
you
're
goin'
arter
 
<EOS>
which
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
felt
her
face
flushing
and
then
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
She
thought
this
coachman
must
know
something
about
her
.
<EOS>
He
must
know
Adam
,
and
might
tell
him
where
she
was
gone
,
for
it
is
difficult
to
country
people
to
believe
that
those
who
make
a
figure
in
their
own
parish
are
not
known
everywhere
else
,
and
it
was
equally
difficult
to
Hetty
to
understand
that
chance
words
could
happen
to
apply
closely
to
her
circumstances
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
frightened
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hegh
,
hegh
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
coachman
,
seeing
that
his
joke
was
not
so
gratifying
as
he
had
expected
,
"
you
munna
take
it
too
ser'ous
;
if
he
's
behaved
ill
,
get
another
.
<EOS>
Such
a
pretty
lass
as
you
can
get
a
sweetheart
any
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
's
fear
was
allayed
by
and
by
,
when
she
found
that
the
coachman
made
no
further
allusion
to
her
personal
concerns
;
but
it
still
had
the
effect
of
preventing
her
from
asking
him
what
were
the
places
on
the
road
to
Windsor
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
she
was
only
going
a
little
way
out
of
Stoniton
,
and
when
she
got
down
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
stopped
,
she
hastened
away
with
her
basket
to
another
part
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
formed
her
plan
of
going
to
Windsor
,
she
had
not
foreseen
any
difficulties
except
that
of
getting
away
,
and
after
she
had
overcome
this
by
proposing
the
visit
to
Dinah
,
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
meeting
with
Arthur
and
the
question
how
he
would
behave
to
her
 
not
resting
on
any
probable
incidents
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
entirely
ignorant
of
traveling
to
imagine
any
of
its
details
,
and
with
all
her
store
of
money
 
<EOS>
her
three
guineas
 
in
her
pocket
<EOS>
,
she
thought
herself
amply
provided
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
until
she
found
how
much
it
cost
her
to
get
to
Stoniton
that
she
began
to
be
alarmed
about
the
journey
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
felt
her
ignorance
as
to
the
places
that
must
be
passed
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
Oppressed
with
this
new
alarm
,
she
walked
along
the
grim
Stoniton
streets
,
and
at
last
turned
into
a
shabby
little
inn
,
where
she
hoped
to
get
a
cheap
lodging
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Here
she
asked
the
landlord
if
he
could
tell
her
what
places
she
must
go
to
,
to
get
to
Windsor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
ca
n't
rightly
say
.
<EOS>
Windsor
must
be
pretty
nigh
London
,
for
it
's
where
the
king
lives
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Anyhow
,
you
'd
best
go
t
'
Ashby
next
 
<EOS>
that
's
south'ard
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
as
many
places
from
here
to
London
as
there
's
houses
in
Stoniton
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
.
<EOS>
I
've
never
been
no
traveller
myself
.
<EOS>
But
how
comes
a
lone
young
woman
like
you
to
be
thinking
<EOS>
o
'
taking
such
a
journey
as
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
going
to
my
brother
 
<EOS>
he
's
a
soldier
at
Windsor
,
"
said
Hetty
,
frightened
at
the
landlord
's
questioning
look
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
afford
to
go
by
the
coach
;
do
you
think
there
's
a
cart
goes
toward
Ashby
in
the
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
there
may
be
carts
if
anybody
knowed
where
they
started
from
;
but
you
might
run
over
the
town
before
you
found
out
.
<EOS>
You
'd
best
set
off
and
walk
,
and
trust
to
summat
overtaking
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Every
word
sank
like
lead
on
Hetty
's
spirits
;
she
saw
the
journey
stretch
bit
by
bit
before
her
now
.
<EOS>
Even
to
get
to
Ashby
seemed
a
hard
thing
:
it
might
take
the
day
,
for
what
she
knew
,
and
that
was
nothing
to
the
rest
of
the
journey
.
<EOS>
But
it
must
be
done
 
<EOS>
she
must
get
to
Arthur
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
she
yearned
to
be
again
with
somebody
who
would
care
for
her
!
<EOS>
She
who
had
never
got
up
in
the
morning
without
the
certainty
of
seeing
familiar
faces
,
people
on
whom
she
had
an
acknowledged
claim
;
whose
farthest
journey
had
been
to
Rosseter
on
the
pillion
with
her
uncle
;
whose
thoughts
had
always
been
taking
holiday
in
dreams
of
pleasure
,
because
all
the
business
of
her
life
was
managed
for
her
 
<EOS>
this
kittenlike
Hetty
,
who
till
a
few
months
ago
had
never
felt
any
other
grief
than
that
of
envying
Mary
Burge
a
new
ribbon
,
or
being
girded
at
by
her
aunt
for
neglecting
Totty
,
must
now
make
her
toilsome
way
in
loneliness
,
her
peaceful
home
left
behind
for
ever
,
and
nothing
but
a
tremulous
hope
of
distant
refuge
before
her
.
<EOS>
Now
for
the
first
time
,
as
she
lay
down
to
-
night
in
the
strange
hard
bed
,
she
felt
that
her
home
had
been
a
happy
one
,
that
her
uncle
had
been
very
good
to
her
,
that
her
quiet
lot
at
Hayslope
among
the
things
and
people
she
knew
,
with
her
little
pride
in
her
one
best
gown
and
bonnet
,
and
nothing
to
hide
from
any
one
,
was
what
she
would
like
to
wake
up
to
as
a
reality
,
and
find
that
all
the
feverish
life
she
had
known
besides
was
a
short
nightmare
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
all
she
had
left
behind
with
yearning
regret
for
her
own
sake
.
<EOS>
Her
own
misery
filled
her
heart
 
<EOS>
there
was
no
room
in
it
for
other
people
's
sorrow
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
before
the
cruel
letter
,
Arthur
had
been
so
tender
and
loving
.
<EOS>
The
memory
of
that
had
still
a
charm
for
her
,
though
it
was
no
more
than
a
soothing
draught
that
just
made
pain
bearable
.
<EOS>
For
Hetty
could
conceive
no
other
existence
for
herself
in
future
than
a
hidden
one
,
and
a
hidden
life
,
even
with
love
,
would
have
had
no
delights
for
her
;
still
less
a
life
mingled
with
shame
.
<EOS>
She
knew
no
romances
,
and
had
only
a
feeble
share
in
the
feelings
which
are
the
source
of
romance
,
so
that
well
-
read
ladies
may
find
it
difficult
to
understand
her
state
of
mind
.
<EOS>
She
was
too
ignorant
of
everything
beyond
the
simple
notions
and
habits
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
to
have
any
more
definite
idea
of
her
probable
future
than
that
Arthur
would
take
care
of
her
somehow
,
and
shelter
her
from
anger
and
scorn
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
marry
her
and
make
her
a
lady
;
and
apart
from
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
he
could
give
towards
which
she
looked
with
longing
and
ambition
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
she
rose
early
,
and
taking
only
some
milk
and
bread
for
her
breakfast
,
set
out
to
walk
on
the
road
towards
Ashby
,
under
a
leaden
-
coloured
sky
,
with
a
narrowing
streak
of
yellow
,
like
a
departing
hope
,
on
the
edge
of
the
horizon
.
<EOS>
Now
in
her
faintness
of
heart
at
the
length
and
difficulty
of
her
journey
,
she
was
most
of
all
afraid
of
spending
her
money
,
and
becoming
so
destitute
that
she
would
have
to
ask
people
's
charity
;
for
Hettv
had
the
pride
not
only
of
a
proud
nature
but
of
a
proud
class
 
the
class
that
pays
the
most
poor
-
rates
,
and
most
shudders
at
the
idea
of
profiting
by
a
poor
-
rate
.
<EOS>
It
had
not
yet
occurred
to
her
that
she
might
get
money
for
her
locket
and
earrings
which
she
carried
with
her
,
and
she
applied
all
her
small
arithmetic
and
knowledge
of
prices
to
calculating
how
many
meals
and
<EOS>
how
many
rides
were
contained
in
her
two
guineas
,
and
the
odd
shillings
,
which
had
a
melancholy
look
,
as
if
they
were
the
pale
ashes
of
the
other
bright
-
flaming
coin
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
few
miles
out
of
Stoniton
,
she
walked
on
bravely
,
always
fixing
on
some
tree
or
gate
or
projecting
bush
at
the
most
distant
visible
point
in
the
road
as
a
goal
,
and
feeling
a
faint
joy
when
she
had
reached
it
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
came
to
the
fourth
milestone
,
the
first
she
had
happened
to
notice
among
the
long
grass
by
the
roadside
,
and
read
that
she
was
still
only
four
miles
beyond
Stoniton
,
her
courage
sank
.
<EOS>
She
had
come
only
this
little
way
,
and
yet
felt
tired
,
and
almost
hungry
again
in
the
keen
morning
air
;
for
though
Hetty
was
accustomed
to
much
movement
and
exertion
indoors
,
she
was
not
used
to
long
walks
which
produced
quite
a
different
sort
of
fatigue
from
that
of
household
activity
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
looking
at
the
milestone
she
felt
some
drops
falling
on
her
face
 
<EOS>
it
was
beginning
to
rain
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
new
trouble
which
had
not
entered
into
her
sad
thoughts
before
,
and
quite
weighed
down
by
this
sudden
addition
to
her
burden
,
she
sat
down
on
the
step
of
a
stile
and
began
to
sob
hysterically
.
<EOS>
The
beginning
of
hardship
is
like
the
first
taste
of
bitter
food
 
<EOS>
it
seems
for
a
moment
unbearable
;
yet
,
if
there
is
nothing
else
to
satisfy
our
hunger
,
we
take
another
bite
and
find
it
possible
to
go
on
.
<EOS>
When
Hetty
recovered
from
her
burst
of
weeping
,
she
rallied
her
fainting
courage
:
it
was
raining
,
and
she
must
try
to
get
on
to
a
village
where
she
might
find
rest
and
shelter
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
as
she
walked
on
wearily
,
she
heard
the
rumbling
of
heavy
wheels
behind
her
;
a
covered
waggon
was
coming
,
creeping
slowly
along
with
a
slouching
driver
cracking
his
whip
beside
the
horses
.
<EOS>
She
waited
for
it
,
thinking
that
if
the
waggoner
were
not
a
very
sour
-
looking
man
,
she
would
ask
him
to
take
her
up
.
<EOS>
As
the
waggon
approached
her
,
the
driver
had
fallen
behind
,
but
there
was
something
in
the
front
of
the
big
vehicle
which
encouraged
her
.
<EOS>
At
any
previous
moment
in
her
life
she
would
not
have
noticed
it
,
but
now
,
the
new
susceptibility
that
suffering
had
awakened
in
her
caused
this
object
to
impress
her
strongly
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
a
small
white
-
and
-
liver
-
coloured
spaniel
which
sat
on
the
front
ledge
of
the
waggon
,
with
large
timid
eyes
,
and
an
incessant
trembling
in
the
body
,
such
as
you
may
have
seen
in
some
of
these
small
creatures
.
<EOS>
Hetty
cared
little
for
animals
,
as
you
know
,
but
at
this
moment
she
felt
as
if
the
helpless
timid
creature
had
some
fellowship
with
her
,
and
without
being
quite
aware
of
the
reason
,
she
was
less
doubtful
about
speaking
to
the
driver
,
who
now
came
forward
 
a
large
ruddy
man
,
with
a
sack
over
his
shoulders
,
by
way
of
scarf
or
mantle
.
  
<EOS>
"
Could
you
take
me
up
in
your
waggon
,
if
you
're
going
towards
Ashby
?
"
said
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
pay
you
for
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aw
,
"
said
the
big
fellow
,
with
that
slowly
dawning
smile
which
belongs
to
heavy
faces
,
"

<EOS>
To
lie
on
the
wool
-
packs
,
with
a
cranny
left
between
the
curtains
of
the
awning
to
let
in
the
air
,
was
luxury
to
Hetty
now
,
and
she
half
-
slept
away
the
hours
till
the
driver
came
to
ask
her
if
she
wanted
to
get
down
and
have
"
some
victual
"
;
he
himself
was
going
to
eat
his
dinner
at
this
"
public
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Late
at
night
they
reached
Leicester
,
and
so
this
second
day
of
Hetty
's
journey
was
past
.
<EOS>
She
had
spent
no
money
except
what
she
had
paid
for
her
food
,
but
she
felt
that
this
slow
journeying
would
be
intolerable
for
her
another
day
,
and
in
the
morning
she
found
her
way
to
a
coach
-
office
to
ask
about
the
road
to
Windsor
,
and
see
if
it
would
cost
her
too
much
to
go
part
of
the
distance
by
coach
again
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
The
distance
was
too
great
 
<EOS>
the
coaches
were
too
dear
 
<EOS>
she
must
give
them
up
;
but
the
elderly
clerk
at
the
office
,
touched
by
her
pretty
anxious
face
,
wrote
down
for
her
the
names
of
the
chief
places
she
must
pass
through
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
only
comfort
she
got
in
Leicester
,
for
the
men
stared
at
her
as
she
went
along
the
street
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
Hetty
wished
no
one
would
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
set
out
walking
again
;
but
this
day
she
was
fortunate
,
for
she
was
soon
overtaken
by
a
carrier
's
cart
which
carried
her
to
Hinckley
,
and
by
the
help
of
a
return
chaise
,
with
a
drunken
postilion
 
who
frightened
her
by
driving
like
Jehu
the
son
of
Nimshi
,
and
shouting
hilarious
remarks
at
her
,
twisting
himself
backwards
on
his
saddle
 
<EOS>
she
was
before
night
in
the
heart
of
woody
Warwickshire
:
<EOS>
but
still
almost
a
hundred
miles
from
Windsor
,
they
told
her
.
<EOS>
Oh
what
a
large
world
it
was
,
and
what
hard
work
for
her
to
find
her
way
in
it
!
<EOS>
She
went
by
mistake
to
Stratford
-
on
-
Avon
,
finding
Stratford
set
down
in
her
list
of
places
,
and
then
she
was
told
she
had
come
a
long
way
out
of
the
right
road
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
the
fifth
day
that
she
got
to
Stony
Stratford
.
<EOS>
That
seems
but
a
slight
journey
as
you
look
at
the
map
,
or
remember
your
own
pleasant
travels
to
and
from
the
meadowy
banks
of
the
Avon
.
<EOS>
But
how
wearily
long
it
was
to
Hetty
!
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
her
as
if
this
country
of
flat
fields
,
and
hedgerows
,
and
dotted
houses
,
and
villages
,
and
market
-
towns
 
all
so
much
alike
to
her
indifferent
eyes
 
must
have
no
end
,
and
she
must
go
on
wandering
among
them
for
ever
,
waiting
tired
at
toll
-
gates
for
some
cart
to
come
,
and
then
finding
the
cart
went
only
a
little
way
 
a
very
little
way
 
to
the
miller
's
a
mile
off
perhaps
;
and
she
hated
going
into
the
public
houses
,
where
she
must
go
to
get
food
and
ask
questions
,
because
there
were
always
men
lounging
there
,
who
stared
at
her
and
joked
her
rudely
.
<EOS>
Her
body
was
very
weary
too
with
these
days
of
new
fatigue
and
anxiety
;
they
had
made
her
look
more
pale
and
worn
than
all
the
time
of
hidden
dread
she
had
gone
through
at
home
.
<EOS>
When
at
last
she
reached
Stony
Stratford
,
her
impatience
and
weariness
had
become
too
strong
for
her
economical
caution
;
she
determined
to
take
the
coach
for
the
rest
of
the
way
,
though
it
should
cost
her
all
her
remaining
money
.
<EOS>
She
would
need
nothing
at
Windsor
but
to
find
Arthur
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
paid
the
fare
for
the
last
coach
,
she
had
only
a
shilling
;
and
as
she
got
down
at
the
sign
of
the
Green
Man
in
Windsor
at
twelve
o'clock
in
the
middle
of
the
seventh
day
,
hungry
and
faint
,
the
coachman
came
up
,
and
begged
her
to
"
remember
him
.
"
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
and
took
out
the
shilling
,
but
the
tears
came
with
the
sense
of
exhaustion
and
the
thought
that
she
was
giving
away
her
last
means
of
getting
food
,
which
she
really
required
before
she
could
go
in
search
of
Arthur
.
<EOS>
As
she
held
out
the
shilling
,
she
lifted
up
her
dark
tear
-
filled
eyes
to
the
coachman
's
face
and
said
,
"
Can
you
give
me
back
sixpence
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
"
he
said
,
gruffly
,
"
never
mind
 
put
the
shilling
up
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
Green
Man
had
stood
near
enough
to
witness
this
scene
,
and
he
was
a
man
whose
abundant
feeding
served
to
keep
his
good
nature
,
as
well
as
his
person
,
in
high
condition
.
<EOS>
And
that
lovely
tearful
face
of
Hetty
's
would
have
found
out
the
sensitive
fibre
in
most
men
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
young
woman
,
come
in
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
have
adrop
o
'
something
;
you
're
pretty
well
knocked
up
,
I
can
see
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
into
the
bar
and
said
to
his
wife
,
"
Here
,
missis
,
take
this
young
woman
into
the
parlour
;
she
's
a
little
overcome
"
 
for
Hetty
's
tears
were
falling
fast
.
<EOS>
They
were
merely
hysterical
tears
:
she
thought
she
had
no
reason
for
weeping
now
,
and
was
vexed
that
she
was
too
weak
and
tired
to
help
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
at
Windsor
at
last
,
not
far
from
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
with
eager
,
hungry
eyes
at
the
bread
and
meat
and
beer
that
the
landlady
brought
her
,
and
for
some
minutes
she
forgot
everything
else
in
the
delicious
sensations
of
satisfying
hunger
and
recovering
from
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
The
landlady
sat
opposite
to
her
as
she
ate
,
and
looked
at
her
earnestly
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
:
Hetty
had
thrown
off
her
bonnet
,
and
her
curls
had
fallen
down
.
<EOS>
Her
face
was
all
the
more
touching
in
its
youth
and
beauty
because
of
its
weary
look
,
and
the
good
woman
's
eyes
presently
wandered
to
her
figure
,
which
in
her
hurried
dressing
on
her
journey
she
had
taken
no
pains
to
conceal
;
moreover
,
the
stranger
's
eye
detects
what
the
familiar
unsuspecting
eye
leaves
unnoticed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
're
not
very
fit
for
travelling
,
"
she
said
,
glancing
while
she
spoke
at
Hetty
's
ringless
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
come
far
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hetty
,
roused
by
this
question
to
exert
more
self
-
command
,
and
feeling
the
better
for
the
food
she
had
taken
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
come
a
good
long
way
,
and
it
's
very
tiring
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
better
now
.
<EOS>
Could
you
tell
me
which
way
to
go
to
this
place
?
"
<EOS>
Here
Hetty
took
from
her
pocket
a
bit
of
paper
:
it
was
the
end
of
Arthur
's
letter
on
which
he
had
written
his
address
.
  
<EOS>
While
she
was
speaking
,
the
landlord
had
come
in
and
had
begun
to
look
at
her
as
earnestly
as
his
wife
had
done
.
<EOS>
He
took
up
the
piece
of
paper
which
Hetty
handed
across
the
table
,
and
read
the
address
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
do
you
want
at
this
house
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
the
nature
of
innkeepers
and
all
men
who
have
no
pressing
business
of
their
own
to
ask
as
many
questions
as
possible
before
giving
any
information
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
a
gentleman
as
is
there
,
"
said
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
no
gentleman
there
,
"
returned
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
shut
up
 
been
shut
up
this
fortnight
.
<EOS>
What
gentleman
is
it
you
want
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
can
let
you
know
where
to
find
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
Captain
Donnithorne
,
"
said
Hetty
tremulously
,
her
heart
beginning
to
beat
painfully
at
this
disappointment
of
her
hope
that
she
should
find
Arthur
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
Captain
Donnithorne
?
<EOS>
Stop
a
bit
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
slowly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
he
in
the
Loamshire
Militia
?
<EOS>
A
tall
young
officer
with
a
fairish
skin
and
reddish
whiskers
 
and
had
a
servant
by
the
name
<EOS>
o
<EOS>
'
Pym
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
"
said
Hetty
;
"
you
know
him
 
<EOS>
where
is
he
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
fine
sight
o
'
miles
away
from
here
.
<EOS>
The
Loamshire
Militia
's
gone
to
Ireland
;
it
's
been
gone
this
fortnight
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
there
!
<EOS>
She
's
fainting
,
"
said
the
landlady
,
hastening
to
support
Hetty
,
who
had
lost
her
miserable
consciousness
and
looked
like
a
beautiful
corpse
.
<EOS>
They
carried
her
to
the
sofa
and
loosened
her
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
's
a
bad
business
,
I
suspect
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
as
he
brought
in
some
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
it
's
plain
enough
<EOS>
what
sort
of
business
it
is
,
"
said
the
wife
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
not
a
common
flaunting
dratchell
,
I
can
see
that
.
<EOS>
She
looks
like
a
respectable
country
girl
,
and
she
comes
from
a
good
way
off
,
to
judge
by
her
tongue
.
<EOS>
She
talks
something
like
that
ostler
we
had
that
come
from
the
north
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
honest
a
fellow
as
we
ever
had
about
the
house
 
<EOS>
they
're
all
honest
folks
in
the
north
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
a
prettier
young
woman
in
my
life
,
"
said
the
husband
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
like
a
pictur
in
a
shop
-
winder
.
<EOS>
It
goes
to
one
's
'
eart
to
look
at
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
have
been
a
good
deal
better
for
her
if
she
'd
been
uglier
and
had
more
conduct
,
"
said
the
landlady
,
who
on
any
charitable
construction
must
have
been
supposed
to
have
more
"
conduct
"
than
beauty
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
's
coming
to
again
.
<EOS>
Fetch
a
drop
more
water
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
Journey
in
Despair
  
HETTY
was
too
ill
through
the
rest
of
that
day
for
any
questions
to
be
addressed
to
her
 
too
ill
even
to
think
with
any
distinctness
of
the
evils
that
were
to
come
.
<EOS>
She
only
felt
that
all
her
hope
was
crushed
,
and
that
instead
of
having
found
a
refuge
she
had
only
reached
the
borders
of
a
new
wilderness
where
no
goal
lay
before
her
.
<EOS>
The
sensations
of
bodily
sickness
,
in
a
comfortable
bed
,
and
with
the
tendance
of
the
good
-
natured
landlady
,
made
a
sort
of
respite
for
her
;
such
a
respite
as
there
is
in
the
faint
weariness
which
obliges
a
man
to
throw
himself
on
the
sand
instead
of
toiling
onward
under
the
scorching
sun
.
  
<EOS>
But
when
sleep
and
rest
had
brought
back
the
strength
necessary
for
the
keenness
of
mental
suffering
 
when
she
lay
the
next
morning
looking
at
the
growing
light
which
was
like
a
cruel
task
-
master
returning
to
urge
from
her
a
fresh
round
of
hated
hopeless
labour
 
<EOS>
she
began
to
think
what
course
she
must
take
,
to
remember
that
all
her
money
was
gone
,
to
look
at
the
prospect
of
further
wandering
among
strangers
with
the
new
clearness
shed
on
it
by
the
experience
of
her
journey
to
Windsor
.
<EOS>
But
which
way
could
she
turn
?
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
enter
into
any
service
,
even
if
she
could
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
but
immediate
beggary
before
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
a
young
woman
who
had
been
found
against
the
church
wall
at
Hayslope
one
Sunday
,
nearly
dead
with
cold
and
hunger
 
a
tiny
infant
in
her
arms
.
<EOS>
The
woman
was
rescued
and
taken
to
the
parish
.
<EOS>
"
The
parish
!
<EOS>
"
You
can
perhaps
hardly
understand
the
effect
of
that
word
on
a
mind
like
Hetty
's
,
brought
up
among
people
who
were
somewhat
hard
in
their
feelings
even
towards
poverty
,
who
lived
among
the
fields
,
and
had
little
pity
for
want
and
rags
as
a
cruel
inevitable
fate
such
as
they
sometimes
seem
in
cities
,
but
held
them
a
mark
of
idleness
and
vice
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
idleness
and
vice
that
brought
burdens
on
the
parish
.
<EOS>
To
Hetty
the
"
parish
"
was
next
to
the
prison
in
obloquy
,
and
to
ask
anything
of
strangers
 
to
beg
 
lay
in
the
same
far
-
off
hideous
region
of
intolerable
shame
that
Hetty
had
all
her
life
thought
it
impossible
she
could
ever
come
near
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
remembrance
of
that
wretched
woman
whom
she
had
seen
herself
,
on
her
way
from
church
,
being
carried
into
Joshua
Rann
's
,
came
back
upon
her
with
the
new
terrible
sense
that
there
was
very
little
now
to
divide
HER
from
the
same
lot
.
<EOS>
And
the
dread
of
bodily
hardship
mingled
with
the
dread
of
shame
;
for
Hetty
had
the
luxurious
nature
of
a
round
soft
-
coated
pet
animal
.
  
<EOS>
How
she
yearned
to
be
back
in
her
safe
home
again
,
cherished
and
cared
for
as
she
had
always
been
!
<EOS>
Her
aunt
's
scolding
about
trifles
would
have
been
music
to
her
ears
now
;
she
longed
for
it
;
she
used
to
hear
it
in
a
time
when
she
had
only
trifles
to
hide
.
<EOS>
Could
she
be
the
same
Hetty
that
used
to
make
up
the
butter
in
the
dairy
with
the
Guelder
roses
peeping
in
at
the
window
 
she
,
a
runaway
whom
her
friends
would
not
open
their
doors
to
again
,
lying
in
this
strange
bed
,
with
the
knowledge
that
she
had
no
money
to
pay
for
what
she
received
,
and
must
offer
those
strangers
some
of
the
clothes
in
her
basket
?
<EOS>
It
was
then
she
thought
of
her
locket
and
ear
-
rings
,
and
seeing
her
pocket
lie
near
,
she
reached
it
and
spread
the
contents
on
the
bed
before
her
.
<EOS>
There
were
the
locket
and
ear
-
rings
in
the
little
velvet
-
lined
boxes
,
and
with
them
there
was
a
beautiful
silver
thimble
which
Adam
had
bought
her
,
<EOS>
the
words
"
Remember
me
"
making
the
ornament
of
the
border
;
a
steel
purse
,
with
her
one
shilling
in
it
;
and
a
small
red
-
leather
case
,
fastening
with
a
strap
.
<EOS>
Those
beautiful
little
ear
-
rings
,
with
their
delicate
pearls
and
garnet
,
that
she
had
tried
in
her
ears
with
such
longing
in
the
bright
sunshine
on
the
30th
of
July
!
<EOS>
She
had
no
longing
to
put
them
in
her
ears
now
:
her
head
with
its
dark
rings
of
hair
lay
back
languidly
on
the
pillow
,
and
the
sadness
that
rested
about
her
brow
and
eyes
was
something
too
hard
for
regretful
memory
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
put
her
hands
up
to
her
ears
:
it
was
because
there
were
some
thin
gold
rings
in
them
,
which
were
also
worth
a
little
money
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
could
surely
get
some
money
for
her
ornaments
:
those
Arthur
had
given
her
must
have
cost
a
great
deal
of
money
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
and
landlady
had
been
good
to
her
;
perhaps
they
would
help
her
to
get
the
money
for
these
things
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
money
would
not
keep
her
long
.
<EOS>
What
should
she
do
when
it
was
gone
?
<EOS>
Where
should
she
go
?
<EOS>
The
horrible
thought
of
want
and
beggary
drove
her
once
to
think
she
would
go
back
to
her
uncle
and
aunt
and
ask
them
to
forgive
her
and
have
pity
on
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
shrank
from
that
idea
again
,
as
she
might
have
shrunk
from
scorching
metal
.
<EOS>
She
could
never
endure
that
shame
before
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
before
Mary
Burge
,
and
the
servants
at
the
Chase
,
and
the
people
at
Broxton
,
and
everybody
who
knew
her
.
<EOS>
They
should
never
know
what
had
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
What
could
she
do
?
<EOS>
She
would
go
away
from
Windsor
 
<EOS>
travel
again
as
she
had
done
the
last
week
,
and
get
among
the
flat
green
fields
with
the
high
hedges
<EOS>
round
them
,
where
nobody
could
see
her
or
know
her
;
and
there
,
perhaps
,
when
there
was
nothing
else
she
could
do
,
she
should
get
courage
to
drown
herself
in
some
pond
like
that
in
the
Scantlands
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
she
would
get
away
from
Windsor
as
soon
as
possible
:
she
did
n't
like
these
people
at
the
inn
to
know
about
her
,
to
know
that
she
had
come
to
look
for
Captain
Donnithorne
.
<EOS>
She
must
think
of
some
reason
to
tell
them
why
she
had
asked
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
thought
she
began
to
put
the
things
back
into
her
pocket
,
meaning
to
get
up
and
dress
before
the
landlady
came
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
hand
on
the
red
-
leather
case
,
when
it
occurred
to
her
that
there
might
be
something
in
this
case
which
she
had
forgotten
 
something
worth
selling
;
for
without
knowing
what
she
should
do
with
her
life
,
she
craved
the
means
of
living
as
long
as
possible
;
and
when
we
desire
eagerly
to
find
something
,
we
are
apt
to
search
for
it
in
hopeless
places
.
<EOS>
No
,
there
was
nothing
but
common
needles
and
pins
,
and
dried
tulip
-
petals
between
the
paper
leaves
where
she
had
written
down
her
little
money
-
accounts
.
<EOS>
But
on
one
of
these
leaves
there
was
a
name
,
which
,
often
as
she
had
seen
it
before
,
now
flashed
on
Hetty
's
mind
like
a
newly
discovered
message
.
<EOS>
The
name
was
 
Dinah
Morris
,
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
text
above
it
,
written
,
as
well
as
the
name
,
by
Dinah
's
own
hand
with
a
little
pencil
,
one
evening
that
they
were
sitting
together
and
Hetty
happened
to
have
the
red
case
lying
open
before
her
.
<EOS>
Hetty
did
not
read
the
text
now
:
she
was
only
arrested
by
the
name
.
<EOS>
Now
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
remembered
without
indifference
the
affectionate
kindness
Dinah
had
shown
her
,
and
those
words
of
Dinah
in
the
bed
-
chamber
 
that
Hetty
must
think
of
her
as
a
friend
in
trouble
.
<EOS>
Suppose
she
were
to
go
to
Dinah
,
and
ask
her
to
help
her
?
<EOS>
Dinah
did
not
think
about
things
as
other
people
did
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
mystery
to
Hetty
,
but
Hetty
knew
she
was
always
kind
.
<EOS>
She
could
n't
imagine
Dinah
's
face
turning
away
from
her
in
dark
reproof
or
scorn
,
Dinah
's
voice
willingly
speaking
ill
of
her
,
or
rejoicing
in
her
misery
as
a
punishment
.
<EOS>
Dinah
did
not
seem
to
belong
to
that
world
of
Hetty
's
,
whose
glance
she
dreaded
like
scorching
fire
.
<EOS>
But
even
to
her
Hetty
shrank
from
beseeching
and
confession
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
prevail
on
herself
to
say
,
"
I
will
go
to
Dinah
"
:
she
only
thought
of
that
as
a
possible
alternative
,
if
she
had
not
courage
for
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
landlady
was
amazed
when
she
saw
Hetty
come
downstairs
soon
after
herself
,
neatly
dressed
,
and
looking
resolutely
self
-
possessed
.
<EOS>
Hetty
told
her
she
was
quite
well
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
had
only
been
very
tired
and
overcome
with
her
journey
,
for
she
had
come
a
long
way
to
ask
about
her
brother
,
who
had
run
away
,
and
they
thought
he
was
gone
for
a
soldier
,
and
Captain
Donnithorne
might
know
,
for
he
had
been
very
kind
to
her
brother
once
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lame
story
,
and
the
landlady
looked
doubtfully
at
Hetty
as
she
told
it
;
but
there
was
a
resolute
air
of
self
-
reliance
about
her
this
morning
,
so
different
from
the
helpless
prostration
of
yesterday
,
that
the
landlady
hardly
knew
how
to
make
a
remark
that
might
seem
like
prying
into
other
people
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
She
only
invited
her
to
sit
down
to
breakfast
with
them
,
and
in
the
course
of
it
Hetty
brought
out
her
ear
-
rings
and
locket
,
and
asked
the
landlord
if
he
could
help
her
to
get
money
for
them
.
<EOS>
Her
journey
,
she
said
,
had
cost
her
much
more
than
she
expected
,
and
now
she
had
no
money
to
get
back
to
her
friends
,
which
she
wanted
to
do
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
the
first
time
the
landlady
had
seen
the
ornaments
,
for
she
had
examined
the
contents
of
Hetty
's
pocket
yesterday
,
and
she
and
her
husband
had
discussed
the
fact
of
a
country
girl
having
these
beautiful
things
,
with
a
stronger
conviction
than
ever
that
Hetty
had
been
miserably
deluded
by
the
fine
young
officer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
when
Hetty
had
spread
the
precious
trifles
before
him
,
"
we
might
take
'em
to
the
jeweller
's
shop
,
for
there
's
one
not
far
off
;
but
Lord
bless
you
,
they
would
n't
give
you
a
quarter
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
what
the
things
are
worth
.
<EOS>
And
you
would
n't
like
to
part
with
'
em
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
looking
at
her
inquiringly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
do
n't
mind
,
"
said
Hetty
,
hastily
,
"
so
as
I
can
get
money
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
they
might
think
the
things
were
stolen
,
as
you
wanted
to
sell
'
em
,
"
he
went
on
,
"
for
it
is
n't
usual
for
a
young
woman
like
you
to
have
fine
jew'llery
like
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
Hetty
's
face
with
anger
.
<EOS>
"
I
belong
to
respectable
folks
,
"
she
said
;
"
I
'm
not
a
thief
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
that
you
are
n't
,
I
'll
be
bound
,
"
said
the
landlady
;
"
and
you
'd
no
call
to
say
that
,
"
looking
indignantly
at
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
The
things
were
gev
to
her
:
that
's
plain
enough
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
did
n't
mean
as
I
thought
so
,
"
said
the
husband
,
apologetically
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
said
it
was
what
the
jeweller
might
think
,
and
so
he
would
n't
be
offering
much
money
for
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
wife
,
"
suppose
you
were
to
advance
some
money
on
the
things
yourself
,
and
then
if
she
liked
to
redeem
'em
when
she
got
home
,
she
could
.
<EOS>
But
if
we
heard
nothing
from
her
after
two
months
,
we
might
do
as
we
liked
with
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
will
not
say
that
in
this
accommodating
proposition
the
landlady
had
no
regard
whatever
to
the
possible
reward
of
her
good
nature
in
the
ultimate
possession
of
the
locket
and
ear
-
rings
:
indeed
,
the
effect
they
would
have
in
that
case
on
the
mind
of
the
grocer
's
wife
had
presented
itself
with
remarkable
vividness
to
her
rapid
imagination
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
took
up
the
ornaments
and
pushed
out
his
lips
in
a
meditative
manner
.
<EOS>
He
wished
Hetty
well
,
doubtless
;
but
pray
,
how
many
of
your
well
-
wishers
would
decline
to
make
a
little
gain
out
of
you
?
<EOS>
Your
landlady
is
sincerely
affected
at
parting
with
you
,
respects
you
highly
,
and
will
really
rejoice
if
any
one
else
is
generous
to
you
;
but
at
the
same
time
she
hands
you
a
bill
by
which
she
gains
as
high
a
percentage
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
money
do
you
want
to
get
home
with
,
young
woman
?
"
said
the
well
-
wisher
,
at
length
.
  
<EOS>
"
Three
guineas
,
"
answered
Hetty
,
fixing
on
the
sum
she
set
out
with
,
for
want
of
any
other
standard
,
and
afraid
of
asking
too
much
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
've
no
objections
to
advance
you
three
guineas
,
"
said
the
landlord
;
"
and
if
you
like
to
send
it
me
back
and
get
the
jewellery
again
,
you
can
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
The
Green
Man
is
n't
going
to
run
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
yes
,
I
'll
be
very
glad
if
you
'll
give
me
that
,
"
said
Hetty
,
relieved
at
the
thought
that
she
would
not
have
to
go
to
the
jeweller
's
and
be
stared
at
and
questioned
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
want
the
things
again
,
you
'll
write
before
long
,
"
said
the
landlady
,
"
because
when
two
months
are
up
,
we
shall
make
up
our
minds
as
you
do
n't
want
'
em
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hetty
indifferently
.
  
<EOS>
The
husband
and
wife
were
equally
content
with
this
arrangement
.
<EOS>
The
husband
thought
,
if
the
ornaments
were
not
redeemed
,
he
could
make
a
good
thing
of
it
by
taking
them
to
London
and
selling
them
.
<EOS>
The
wife
thought
she
would
coax
the
good
man
into
letting
her
keep
them
.
<EOS>
And
they
were
accommodating
Hetty
,
poor
thing
 
<EOS>
a
pretty
,
respectable
-
looking
young
woman
,
apparently
in
a
sad
case
.
<EOS>
They
declined
to
take
anything
for
her
food
and
bed
:
she
was
quite
welcome
.
<EOS>
And
at
eleven
o'clock
Hetty
said
"
Good
-
bye
"
to
them
with
the
same
quiet
,
resolute
air
she
had
worn
all
the
morning
,
mounting
the
coach
that
was
to
take
her
twenty
miles
back
along
the
way
she
had
come
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
strength
of
self
-
possession
which
is
the
sign
that
the
last
hope
has
departed
.
<EOS>
Despair
no
more
leans
on
others
than
perfect
contentment
,
and
in
despair
pride
ceases
to
be
counteracted
by
the
sense
of
dependence
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
felt
that
no
one
could
deliver
her
from
the
evils
that
would
make
life
hateful
to
her
;
and
no
one
,
she
said
to
herself
,
should
ever
know
her
misery
and
humiliation
.
<EOS>
No
;
she
would
not
confess
even
to
Dinah
.
<EOS>
She
would
wander
out
of
sight
,
and
drown
herself
where
her
body
would
never
be
found
,
and
no
one
should
know
what
had
become
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
got
off
this
coach
,
she
began
to
walk
again
,
and
take
cheap
rides
in
carts
,
and
get
cheap
meals
,
going
on
and
on
without
distinct
purpose
,
yet
strangely
,
by
some
fascination
,
taking
the
way
she
had
come
,
though
she
was
determined
not
to
go
back
to
her
own
country
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
had
fixed
her
mind
on
the
grassy
Warwickshire
fields
,
with
the
bushy
tree
-
studded
hedgerows
that
made
a
hiding
-
place
even
in
this
leafless
season
.
<EOS>
She
went
more
slowly
than
she
came
,
often
getting
over
the
stiles
and
sitting
for
hours
under
the
hedgerows
,
looking
before
her
with
blank
,
beautiful
eyes
;
fancying
herself
at
the
edge
of
a
hidden
pool
,
low
down
,
like
that
in
the
Scantlands
;
wondering
if
it
were
very
painful
to
be
drowned
,
and
if
there
would
be
anything
worse
after
death
than
what
she
dreaded
in
life
.
<EOS>
Religious
doctrines
had
taken
no
hold
on
Hetty
's
mind
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
those
numerous
people
who
have
had
godfathers
and
godmothers
,
learned
their
catechism
,
been
confirmed
,
and
gone
to
church
every
Sunday
,
and
yet
,
for
any
practical
result
of
strength
in
life
,
or
trust
in
death
,
have
never
appropriated
a
single
Christian
idea
or
Christian
feeling
.
<EOS>
You
would
misunderstand
her
thoughts
during
these
wretched
days
,
if
you
imagined
that
they
were
influenced
either
by
religious
fears
or
religious
hopes
.
  
<EOS>
She
chose
to
go
to
Stratford
-
on
-
Avon
again
,
where
she
had
gone
before
by
mistake
,
for
she
remembered
some
grassy
fields
on
her
former
way
towards
it
 
fields
among
which
she
thought
she
might
find
just
the
sort
of
pool
she
had
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Yet
she
took
care
of
her
money
still
;
she
carried
her
basket
;
death
seemed
still
a
long
way
off
,
and
life
was
so
strong
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
craved
food
and
rest
 
<EOS>
she
hastened
towards
them
at
the
very
moment
she
was
picturing
to
herself
the
bank
from
which
she
would
leap
towards
death
.
<EOS>
It
was
already
five
days
since
she
had
left
Windsor
,
for
she
had
wandered
about
,
always
avoiding
speech
or
questioning
looks
,
and
recovering
her
air
of
proud
self
-
dependence
whenever
she
was
under
observation
,
choosing
her
decent
lodging
at
night
,
and
dressing
herself
neatly
in
the
morning
,
and
setting
off
on
her
way
steadily
,
or
remaining
under
shelter
if
it
rained
,
as
if
she
had
a
happy
life
to
cherish
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
,
even
in
her
most
self
-
conscious
moments
,
the
face
was
sadly
different
from
that
which
had
smiled
at
itself
in
the
old
specked
glass
,
or
smiled
at
others
when
they
glanced
at
it
admiringly
.
<EOS>
A
hard
and
even
fierce
look
had
come
in
the
eyes
,
though
their
lashes
were
as
long
as
ever
,
and
they
had
all
their
dark
brightness
.
<EOS>
And
the
cheek
was
never
dimpled
with
smiles
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
rounded
,
pouting
,
childish
prettiness
,
but
with
all
love
and
belief
in
love
departed
from
it
 
the
sadder
for
its
beauty
,
like
that
wondrous
Medusa
-
face
,
with
the
passionate
,
passionless
lips
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
she
was
among
the
fields
she
had
been
dreaming
of
,
on
a
long
narrow
pathway
leading
towards
a
wood
.
<EOS>
If
there
should
be
a
pool
in
that
wood
!
<EOS>
It
would
be
better
hidden
than
one
in
the
fields
.
<EOS>
No
,
it
was
not
a
wood
,
only
a
wild
brake
,
where
there
had
once
been
gravel
-
pits
,
leaving
mounds
and
hollows
studded
with
brushwood
and
small
trees
.
<EOS>
She
roamed
up
and
down
,
thinking
there
was
perhaps
a
pool
in
every
hollow
before
she
came
to
it
,
till
her
limbs
were
weary
,
and
she
sat
down
to
rest
.
<EOS>
The
afternoon
was
far
advanced
,
and
the
leaden
sky
was
darkening
,
as
if
the
sun
were
setting
behind
it
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
while
Hetty
started
up
again
,
feeling
that
darkness
would
soon
come
on
;
and
she
must
put
off
finding
the
pool
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
make
her
way
to
some
shelter
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
She
had
quite
lost
her
way
in
the
fields
,
and
might
as
well
go
in
one
direction
as
another
,
for
aught
she
knew
.
<EOS>
She
walked
through
field
after
field
,
and
no
village
,
no
house
was
in
sight
;
but
there
,
at
the
corner
of
this
pasture
,
there
was
a
break
in
the
hedges
;
the
land
seemed
to
dip
down
a
little
,
and
two
trees
leaned
towards
each
other
across
the
opening
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
heart
gave
a
great
beat
as
she
thought
there
must
be
a
pool
there
.
<EOS>
She
walked
towards
it
heavily
over
the
tufted
grass
,
with
pale
lips
and
a
sense
of
trembling
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
the
thing
were
come
in
spite
of
herself
,
instead
of
being
the
object
of
her
search
.
  
<EOS>
There
it
was
,
black
under
the
darkening
sky
:
<EOS>
no
motion
,
no
sound
near
.
<EOS>
She
set
down
her
basket
,
and
then
sank
down
herself
on
the
grass
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
The
pool
had
its
wintry
depth
now
:
by
the
time
it
got
shallow
,
as
she
remembered
the
pools
did
at
Hayslope
,
in
the
summer
,
no
one
could
find
out
that
it
was
her
body
.
<EOS>
But
then
there
was
her
basket
 
<EOS>
she
must
hide
that
too
.
<EOS>
She
must
throw
it
into
the
water
 
<EOS>
make
it
heavy
with
stones
first
,
and
then
throw
it
in
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
to
look
about
for
stones
,
and
soon
brought
five
or
six
,
which
she
laid
down
beside
her
basket
,
and
then
sat
down
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
need
to
hurry
 
<EOS>
there
was
all
the
night
to
drown
herself
in
.
<EOS>
She
sat
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
basket
.
<EOS>
She
was
weary
,
hungry
.
<EOS>
There
were
some
buns
in
her
basket
 
three
,
which
she
had
supplied
herself
with
at
the
place
where
she
ate
her
dinner
.
<EOS>
She
took
them
out
now
and
ate
them
eagerly
,
and
then
sat
still
again
,
looking
at
the
pool
.
<EOS>
The
soothed
sensation
that
came
over
her
from
the
satisfaction
of
her
hunger
,
and
this
fixed
dreamy
attitude
,
brought
on
drowsiness
,
and
presently
her
head
sank
down
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
She
was
fast
asleep
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
awoke
it
was
deep
night
,
and
she
felt
chill
.
<EOS>
She
was
frightened
at
this
darkness
 
frightened
at
the
long
night
before
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
but
throw
herself
into
the
water
!
<EOS>
No
,
not
yet
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
walk
about
that
she
might
get
warm
again
,
as
if
she
would
have
more
resolution
then
.
<EOS>
Oh
how
long
the
time
was
in
that
darkness
!
<EOS>
The
bright
hearth
and
the
warmth
and
the
voices
of
home
,
the
secure
uprising
and
lying
down
,
the
familiar
fields
,
the
familiar
people
,
the
Sundays
and
holidays
with
their
simple
joys
of
dress
and
feasting
 
all
the
sweets
of
her
young
life
rushed
before
her
now
,
and
she
seemed
to
be
stretching
her
arms
towards
them
across
a
great
gulf
.
<EOS>
She
set
her
teeth
when
she
thought
of
Arthur
.
<EOS>
She
cursed
him
,
without
knowing
what
her
cursing
would
do
.
<EOS>
She
wished
he
too
might
know
desolation
,
and
cold
,
and
a
life
of
shame
that
he
dared
not
end
by
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
horror
of
this
cold
,
and
darkness
,
and
solitude
 
out
of
all
human
reach
 
became
greater
every
long
minute
.
<EOS>
It
was
almost
as
if
she
were
dead
already
,
and
knew
that
she
was
dead
,
and
longed
to
get
back
to
life
again
.
<EOS>
But
no
:
she
was
alive
still
;
she
had
not
taken
the
dreadful
leap
.
<EOS>
She
felt
a
strange
contradictory
wretchedness
and
exultation
:
wretchedness
,
that
she
did
not
dare
to
face
death
;
exultation
,
that
she
was
still
in
life
 
that
she
might
yet
know
light
and
warmth
again
.
<EOS>
She
walked
backwards
and
forwards
to
warm
herself
,
beginning
to
discern
something
of
the
objects
around
her
,
as
her
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
night
 
<EOS>
the
darker
line
of
the
hedge
,
the
rapid
motion
of
some
living
creature
 
perhaps
a
field
-
mouse
 
rushing
across
the
grass
.
<EOS>
She
no
longer
felt
as
if
the
darkness
hedged
her
in
.
<EOS>
She
thought
she
could
walk
back
across
the
field
,
and
get
over
the
stile
;
and
then
,
in
the
very
next
field
,
she
thought
she
remembered
there
was
a
hovel
of
furze
near
a
sheepfold
.
<EOS>
If
she
could
get
into
that
hovel
,
she
would
be
warmer
.
<EOS>
She
could
pass
the
night
there
,
for
<EOS>
that
was
what
Alick
did
at
Hayslope
in
lambing
-
time
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
this
hovel
brought
the
energy
of
a
new
hope
.
<EOS>
She
took
up
her
basket
and
walked
across
the
field
,
but
it
was
some
time
before
she
got
in
the
right
direction
for
the
stile
.
<EOS>
The
exercise
and
the
occupation
of
finding
the
stile
were
a
stimulus
to
her
,
however
,
and
lightened
the
horror
of
the
darkness
and
solitude
.
<EOS>
There
were
sheep
in
the
next
field
,
and
she
startled
a
group
as
she
set
down
her
basket
and
got
over
the
stile
;
and
the
sound
of
their
movement
comforted
her
,
for
it
assured
her
that
her
impression
was
right
 
<EOS>
this
was
the
field
where
she
had
seen
the
hovel
,
for
it
was
the
field
where
the
sheep
were
.
<EOS>
Right
on
along
the
path
,
and
she
would
get
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
reached
the
opposite
gate
,
and
felt
her
way
along
its
rails
and
the
rails
of
the
sheep
-
fold
,
till
her
hand
encountered
the
pricking
of
the
gorsy
wall
.
<EOS>
Delicious
sensation
!
<EOS>
She
had
found
the
shelter
.
<EOS>
She
groped
her
way
,
touching
the
prickly
gorse
,
to
the
door
,
and
pushed
it
open
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
ill
-
smelling
close
place
,
but
warm
,
and
there
was
straw
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Hetty
sank
down
on
the
straw
with
a
sense
of
escape
.
<EOS>
Tears
came
 
<EOS>
she
had
never
shed
tears
before
since
she
left
Windsor
 
tears
and
sobs
of
hysterical
joy
that
she
had
still
hold
of
life
,
that
she
was
still
on
the
familiar
earth
,
with
the
sheep
near
her
.
<EOS>
The
very
consciousness
of
her
own
limbs
was
a
delight
to
her
:
she
turned
up
her
sleeves
,
and
kissed
her
arms
with
the
passionate
love
of
life
.
<EOS>
Soon
warmth
and
weariness
lulled
her
in
the
midst
of
her
sobs
,
and
she
fell
continually
into
dozing
,
fancying
herself
at
the
brink
of
the
pool
again
 
fancying
that
she
had
jumped
into
the
water
,
and
then
awaking
with
a
start
,
and
wondering
where
she
was
.
<EOS>
But
at
last
deep
dreamless
sleep
came
;
her
head
,
guarded
by
her
bonnet
,
found
a
pillow
against
the
gorsy
wall
,
and
the
poor
soul
,
driven
to
and
fro
between
two
equal
terrors
,
found
the
one
relief
that
was
possible
to
it
 
the
relief
of
unconsciousness
.
  
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
That
relief
seems
to
end
the
moment
it
has
begun
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
Hetty
as
if
those
dozen
dreams
had
only
passed
into
another
dream
 
that
she
was
in
the
hovel
,
and
her
aunt
was
standing
over
her
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
under
her
aunt
's
glance
,
and
opened
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
candle
,
but
there
was
light
in
the
hovel
 
the
light
of
early
morning
through
the
open
door
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
face
looking
down
on
her
;
but
it
was
an
unknown
face
,
belonging
to
an
elderly
man
in
a
smock
-
frock
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
do
you
do
here
,
young
woman
?
<EOS>
"
the
man
said
roughly
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
trembled
still
worse
under
this
real
fear
and
shame
than
she
had
done
in
her
momentary
dream
under
her
aunt
's
glance
.
<EOS>
She
felt
that
she
was
like
a
beggar
already
 
found
sleeping
in
that
place
.
<EOS>
But
in
spite
of
her
trembling
,
she
was
so
eager
to
account
to
the
man
for
her
presence
here
,
that
she
found
words
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
lost
my
way
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
travelling
 
north'ard
,
and
I
got
away
from
the
road
into
the
fields
,
and
was
overtaken
by
the
dark
.
<EOS>
Will
you
tell
me
the
way
to
the
nearest
village
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
got
up
as
she
was
speaking
,
and
put
her
hands
to
her
bonnet
to
adjust
it
,
and
then
laid
hold
of
her
basket
.
  
<EOS>
The
man
looked
at
her
with
a
slow
bovine
gaze
,
without
giving
her
any
answer
,
for
some
seconds
.
<EOS>
Then
he
turned
away
and
walked
towards
the
door
of
the
hovel
,
but
it
was
not
till
he
got
there
that
he
stood
still
,
and
,
turning
his
shoulder
half
-
round
towards
her
,
said
,
"
Aw
,
I
can
show
you
the
way
to
Norton
,
if
you
like
.
<EOS>
But
what
do
you
do
gettin
'
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
highroad
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
with
a
tone
of
gruff
reproof
.
"
<EOS>
Y'ull
be
gettin
'
into
mischief
,
if
you
dooant
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hetty
,
"
I
wo
n't
do
it
again
.
<EOS>
I
'll
keep
in
the
road
,
if
you
'll
be
so
good
as
show
me
how
to
get
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
dooant
you
keep
where
there
's
a
finger
-
poasses
an
'
folks
to
ax
the
way
on
?
"
<EOS>
the
man
said
,
still
more
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Anybody
'
ud
think
you
was
a
wild
woman
,
an
'
look
at
yer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
frightened
at
this
gruff
old
man
,
and
still
more
at
this
last
suggestion
that
she
looked
like
a
wild
woman
.
<EOS>
As
she
followed
him
out
of
the
hovel
she
thought
she
would
give
him
a
sixpence
for
telling
her
the
way
,
and
then
he
would
not
suppose
she
was
wild
.
<EOS>
As
he
stopped
to
point
out
the
road
to
her
,
she
put
her
hand
in
her
pocket
to
get
the
six
-
pence
ready
,
and
when
he
was
turning
away
,
without
saying
good
-
morning
,
she
held
it
out
to
him
and
said
,
"
Thank
you
;
will
you
please
to
take
something
for
your
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
slowly
at
the
sixpence
,
and
then
said
,
"
I
want
none
o
'
your
money
.
<EOS>
You
'd
better
take
care
on't
,
<EOS>
else
you
'll
get
it
stool
from
yer
,
if
you
go
trapesin
'
about
the
fields
like
a
mad
woman
a
-
thatway
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
man
left
her
without
further
speech
,
and
Hetty
held
on
her
way
.
<EOS>
Another
day
had
risen
,
and
she
must
wander
on
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
use
to
think
of
drowning
herself
 
she
could
not
do
it
,
at
least
while
she
had
money
left
to
buy
food
and
strength
to
journey
on
.
<EOS>
But
the
incident
on
her
waking
this
morning
heightened
her
dread
of
that
time
when
her
money
would
be
all
gone
;
she
would
have
to
sell
her
basket
and
clothes
then
,
and
she
would
really
look
like
a
beggar
or
a
wild
woman
,
as
the
man
had
said
.
<EOS>
The
passionate
joy
in
life
she
had
felt
in
the
night
,
after
escaping
from
the
brink
of
the
black
cold
death
in
the
pool
,
was
gone
now
.
<EOS>
Life
now
,
by
the
morning
light
,
with
the
impression
of
that
man
's
hard
wondering
look
at
her
,
was
as
full
of
dread
as
death
 
<EOS>
it
was
worse
;
it
was
a
dread
to
which
she
felt
chained
,
from
which
she
shrank
and
shrank
as
she
did
from
the
black
pool
,
and
yet
could
find
no
refuge
from
it
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
out
her
money
from
her
purse
,
and
looked
at
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
still
two
-
and
-
twenty
shillings
;
it
would
serve
her
for
many
days
more
,
or
it
would
help
her
to
get
on
faster
to
Stonyshire
,
within
reach
of
Dinah
.
<EOS>
The
thought
of
Dinah
urged
itself
more
strongly
now
,
since
the
experience
of
the
night
had
driven
her
shuddering
imagination
away
from

pool

<EOS>
If
it
had
been
only
going
to
Dinah
 
<EOS>
if
nobody
besides
Dinah
would
ever
know
 
Hetty
could
have
made
up
her
mind
to
go
to
her
.
<EOS>
The
soft
voice
,
the
pitying
eyes
,
would
have
drawn
her
.
<EOS>
But
afterwards
the
other
people
must
know
,
and
she
could
no
more
rush
on
that
shame
than
she
could
rush
on
death
.
  
<EOS>
She
must
wander
on
and
on
,
and
wait
for
a
lower
depth
of
despair
to
give
her
courage
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
death
would
come
to
her
,
for
she
was
getting
less
and
less
able
to
bear
the
day
's
weariness
.
<EOS>
And
yet
 
such
is
the
strange
action
of
our
souls
,
drawing
us
by
a
lurking
desire
towards
the
very
ends
we
dread
 
Hetty
,
when
she
set
out
again
from
Norton
,
asked
the
straightest
road
northwards
towards
Stonyshire
,
and
kept
it
all
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
Poor
wandering
Hetty
,
with
the
rounded
childish
face
and
the
hard
,
unloving
,
despairing
soul
looking
out
of
it
 
with
the
narrow
heart
and
narrow
thoughts
,
<EOS>
no
room
in
them
for
any
sorrows
but
her
own
,
and
tasting
that
sorrow
with
the
more
intense
bitterness
!
<EOS>
My
heart
bleeds
for
her
as
I
see
her
toiling
along
on
her
weary
feet
,
or
seated
in
a
cart
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
vacantly
on
the
road
before
her
,
never
thinking
or
caring
whither
it
tends
,
till
hunger
comes
and
makes
her
desire
that
a
village
may
be
near
.
  
<EOS>
What
will
be
the
end
,
the
end
of
her
objectless
wandering
,
apart
from
all
love
,
caring
for
human
beings
only
through
her
pride
,
clinging
to
life
only
as
the
hunted
wounded
brute
clings
to
it
?
  
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
and
me
from
being
the
beginners
of
such
misery
!
    
<EOS>
The
Quest
  
<EOS>
THE
first
ten
days
after
Hetty
's
departure
passed
as
quietly
as
any
other
days
with
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
with
Adam
at
his
daily
work
.
<EOS>
They
had
expected
Hetty
to
stay
away
a
week
or
ten
days
at
least
,
perhaps
a
little
longer
if
Dinah
came
back
with
her
,
because
there
might
then
be
something
to
detain
them
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
But
when
a
fortnight
had
passed
they
began
to
feel
a
little
surprise
that
Hetty
did
not
return
;
she
must
surely
have
found
it
pleasanter
to
be
with
Dinah
than
any
one
could
have
supposed
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
for
his
part
,
was
getting
very
impatient
to
see
her
,
and
he
resolved
that
,
if
she
did
not
appear
the
next
day
(
Saturday
)
,
he
would
set
out
on
Sunday
morning
to
fetch
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
coach
on
a
Sunday
,
but
by
setting
out
before
it
was
light
,
and
perhaps
getting
a
lift
in
a
cart
by
the
way
,
he
would
arrive
pretty
early
at
Snowfield
,
and
bring
back
Hetty
the
next
day
 
Dinah
too
,
if
she
were
coming
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
time
Hetty
came
home
,
and
he
would
afford
to
lose
his
Monday
for
the
sake
of
bringing
her
.
  
<EOS>
His
project
was
quite
approved
at
the
Farm
when
he
went
there
on
Saturday
evening
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
desired
him
emphatically
not
to
come
back
without
Hetty
,
for
she
had
been
quite
too
long
away
,
considering
the
things
she
had
to
get
ready
by
the
middle
of
March
,
and
a
week
was
surely
enough
for
any
one
to
go
out
for
their
health
.
<EOS>
As
for
Dinah
,
Mrs.
Poyser
had
small
hope
of
their
bringing
her
,
unless
they
could
make
her
believe
the
folks
at
Hayslope
were
twice
as
miserable
as
the
folks
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Though
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
by
way
of
conclusion
,
"
you
might
tell
her
she
's
got
<EOS>
but
one
aunt
left
,
and
SHE
'S
wasted
pretty
nigh
to
a
shadder
;
and
we
shall
p'rhaps
all
be
gone
twenty
mile
farther
off
her
next
Michaelmas
,
and
shall
die
o
'
broken
hearts
among
strange
folks
,
and
leave
the
children
fatherless
and
motherless
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
certainly
had
the
air
of
a
man
perfectly
heart
-
whole
,
"
it
isna
so
bad
as
that
.
<EOS>
Thee't
looking
rarely
now
,
and
getting
flesh
every
day
.
<EOS>
But
I
'd
be
glad
for
Dinah
t
'
come
,
for
she
'd
help
thee
wi
'
the
little
uns
<EOS>
:
they
took
t
'
her
wonderful
.
"
  
<EOS>
So
at
daybreak
,
on
Sunday
,
Adam
set
off
.
<EOS>
Seth
went
with
him
the
first
mile
or
two
,
for
the
thought
of
Snowfield
and
the
possibility
that
Dinah
might
come
again
made
him
restless
,
and
the
walk
with
Adam
in
the
cold
morning
air
,
both
in
their
best
clothes
,
helped
to
give
him
a
sense
of
Sunday
calm
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
last
morning
in
February
,
with
a
low
grey
sky
,
and
a
slight
hoar
-
frost
on
the
green
border
of
the
road
and
on
the
black
hedges
.
<EOS>
They
heard
the
gurgling
of
the
full
brooklet
hurrying
down
the
hill
,
and
the
faint
twittering
of
the
early
birds
.
<EOS>
For
they
walked
in
silence
,
though
with
a
pleased
sense
of
companionship
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
lad
,
"
said
Adam
,
laying
his
hand
on
Seth
's
shoulder
and
looking
at
him
affectionately
as
they
were
about
to
part
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
thee
wast
going
<EOS>
all
the
way
wi
'
me
,
and
as
happy
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
content
,
Addy
,
I
'm
content
,
"
said
Seth
cheerfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
an
old
bachelor
,
belike
,
and
make
a
fuss
wi
'
thy
children
.
"
  
<EOS>
The'y
turned
away
from
each
other
,
and
Seth
walked
leisurely
homeward
,
mentally
repeating
one
of
his
favourite
hymns
 
<EOS>
he
was
very
fond
of
hymns
:
       
<EOS>
Dark
and
cheerless
is
the
morn
     
Unaccompanied
by
thee
:
     
<EOS>
Joyless
is
the
day
's
return
     
<EOS>
Till
thy
mercy
's
beams
<EOS>
I
see
:
     
<EOS>
Till
thou
inward
light
impart
,
     
Glad
<EOS>
my
eyes
and
warm
my
heart
.
       
<EOS>
Visit
,
then
,
this
soul
of
mine
,
     
Pierce
<EOS>
the
gloom
of
sin
and
grief
       
Fill
me
,
Radiancy
Divine
,
     
Scatter
<EOS>
all
my
unbelief
.
     
<EOS>
More
and
more
thyself
display
,
     
<EOS>
Shining
to
the
perfect
day
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
walked
much
faster
,
and
any
one
coming
along
the
Oakbourne
road
at
sunrise
that
morning
must
have
had
a
pleasant
sight
in
this
tall
broad
-
chested
man
,
striding
along
with
a
carriage
as
upright
and
firm
as
any
soldier
's
,
glancing
with
keen
glad
eyes
at
the
dark
-
blue
hills
as
they
began
to
show
themselves
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
Seldom
in
Adam
's
life
had
his
face
been
so
free
from
any
cloud
of
anxiety
as
it
was
this
morning
;
and
this
freedom
from
care
,
as
is
usual
with
constructive
practical
minds
like
his
,
made
him
all
the
more
observant
of
the
objects
round
him
and
all
the
more
ready
to
gather
suggestions
from
them
towards
his
own
favourite
plans
and
ingenious
contrivances
.
<EOS>
His
happy
love
 
the
knowledge
that
his
steps
were
carrying
him
nearer
and
nearer
to
Hetty
,
who
was
so
soon
to
be
his
 
was
to
his
thoughts
what
the
sweet
morning
air
was
to
his
sensations
:
it
gave
him
a
consciousness
of
well
-
being
that
made
activity
delightful
.
<EOS>
Every
now
<EOS>
and
then
there
was
a
rush
of
more
intense
feeling
towards
her
,
which
chased
away
other
images
than
Hetty
;
and
along
with
that
<EOS>
would
come
a
wondering
thankfulness
that
all
this
happiness
was
given
to
him
 
that
this
life
of
ours
had
such
sweetness
in
it
.
<EOS>
For
Adam
had
a
devout
mind
,
though
he
was
perhaps
rather
impatient
of
devout
words
,
and
his
tenderness
lay
very
close
to
his
reverence
,
so
that
the
one
could
hardly
be
stirred
without
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
after
feeling
had
welled
up
and
poured
itself
out
in
this
way
,
busy
thought
would
come
back
with
the
greater
vigour
;
and
this
morning
it
was
intent
on
schemes
by
which
the
roads
might
be
improved
that
were
so
imperfect
all
through
the
country
,
and
on
picturing
all
the
benefits
that
might
come
from
the
exertions
of
a
single
country
gentleman
,
if
he
would
set
himself
to
getting
the
roads
made
good
in
his
own
district
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
a
very
short
walk
,
the
ten
miles
to
Oakbourne
,
that
pretty
town
within
sight
of
the
blue
hills
,
where
he
break
-
fasted
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
the
country
grew
barer
and
barer
:
no
more
rolling
woods
,
no
more
wide
-
branching
trees
near
frequent
homesteads
,
no
more
bushy
hedgerows
,
but
greystone
walls
intersecting
the
meagre
pastures
,
and
dismal
wide
-
scattered
greystone
houses
on
broken
lands
where
mines
had
been
and
were
no
longer
.
"
<EOS>
A
hungry
land
,
"
said
Adam
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
go
south'ard
,
where
they
say
it
's
as
flat
as
a
table
,
than
come
to
live
here
;
though
if
Dinah
likes
to
live
in
a
country
where
she
can
be
the
most
comfort
to
folks
,
she
's
i
'
the
right
to
live
o
'
this
side
;
for
she
must
look
as
if
she
'd
come
straight
from
heaven
,
like
th
'
angels
in
the
desert
,
to
strengthen
them
as
ha
'
got
nothing
t
'
eat
.
"
<EOS>
And
when
at
last
he
came
in
sight
of
Snowfield
,
he
thought
it
looked
like
a
town
that
was
"
fellow
to
the
country
,
"
though
the
stream
through
the
valley
where
the
great
mill
stood
gave
a
pleasant
greenness
to
the
lower
fields
.
<EOS>
The
town
lay
,
grim
,
stony
,
and
unsheltered
,
up
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
,
and
Adam
did
not
go
forward
to
it
at
present
,
for
Seth
had
told
him
where
to
find
Dinah
.
<EOS>
It
was
at
a
thatched
cottage
outside
the
town
,
a
little
way
from
the
mill
 
<EOS>
an
old
cottage
,
standing
sideways
towards
the
road
,
with
a
little
bit
of
potato
-
ground
before
it
.
<EOS>
Here
Dinah
lodged
with
an
elderly
couple
;
and
if
she
and
Hetty
happened
to
be
out
,
Adam
could
learn
where
they
were
gone
,
or
when
they
would
be
at
home
again
.
<EOS>
Dinah
might
be
out
on
some
preaching
errand
,
and
perhaps
she
would
have
left
Hetty
at
home
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
not
help
hoping
this
,
and
as
he
recognized
the
cottage
by
the
roadside
before
him
,
there
shone
out
in
his
face
that
involuntary
smile
which
belongs
to
the
expectation
of
a
near
joy
.
  
<EOS>
He
hurried
his
step
along
the
narrow
causeway
,
and
rapped
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
opened
by
a
very
clean
old
woman
,
with
a
slow
palsied
shake
of
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Dinah
Morris
at
home
?
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh?
<EOS>
...
no
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
looking
up
at
this
tall
stranger
with
a
wonder
that
made
her
slower
of
speech
than
usual
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
please
to
come
in
?
"
she
added
,
retiring
from
the
door
,
as
if
recollecting
herself
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
ye're
brother
to
the
young
man
as
come
afore
,
arena
ye
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Adam
,
entering
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
Seth
Bede
.
<EOS>
I
'm
his
brother
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
to
give
his
respects
to
you
and
your
good
master
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
the
same
t
'
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
gracious
young
man
.
<EOS>
An
'
ye

,
on'y
<EOS>
ye're
darker

<EOS>
Sit

down
<EOS>
i
'
th
'
arm
-
chair
.
<EOS>
My
man
isna
come
home
from
meeting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
sat
down
patiently
,
not
liking
to
hurry
the
shaking
old
woman
with
questions
,
but
looking
eagerly
towards
the
narrow
twisting
stairs
in
one
corner
,
for
he
thought
it
was
possible
<EOS>
Hetty
might
have
heard
his
voice
and
would
come
down
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
you
're
come
to
see
Dinah
Morris
?
"
said
the
old
woman
,
standing
opposite
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
An
'
you
didn
'
know
<EOS>
she
was
away
from
home
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
it
likely
she
might
be
away
,
seeing
as
it
's
Sunday
.
<EOS>
But
the
other
young
woman
 
is
she
at
home
,
or
gone
along
with
Dinah
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
looked
at
Adam
with
a
bewildered
air
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gone
along
wi
'
her
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
Dinah
's
gone
to
Leeds
,
<EOS>
a
big
town
ye
may
ha
'
heared
on
,
where
there
's
a
many
o

the
Lord
's
people
.
<EOS>
She
's
been
gone
<EOS>
sin
'
Friday
was
a
fortnight
:
they
sent
her
the
money
for
her
journey
.
<EOS>
You
may
see
her
room
here
,
"
she
went
on
,
opening
a
door
and
not
noticing
the
effect
of
her
words
on
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
rose
and
followed
her
,
and
darted
an
eager
glance
into
the
little
room
with
its
narrow
bed
,
the
portrait
of
Wesley
on
the
wall
,
and
the
few
books
lying
on
the
large
Bible
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
an
irrational
hope
that
Hetty
might
be
there
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
speak
in
the
first
moment
after
seeing
that
the
room
was
empty
;
an
undefined
fear
had
seized
him
 
something
had
happened
to
Hetty
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Still
the
old
woman
was
so
slow
of
;
speech
and
apprehension
,
that
Hetty
might
be
at
Snowfield
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
ye
didna
know
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
Have
ye
come
from
your
own
country
o
'
purpose
to
see
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Hetty
 
Hetty
Sorrel

said
Adam
,
abruptly
;
"
Where
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nobody
by
that
name
,
"
said
the
old
woman
,
wonderingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Is
it
anybody
ye've
heared
on
at
Snowfield
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
there
come
no
young
woman
here
 
<EOS>
very
young
and
pretty
 
Friday
was
a
fortnight
,
to
see
Dinah
Morris
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
I'n
seen
no
young
woman
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Think
;
are
you
quite
sure
?
<EOS>
A
girl
,
eighteen
years
old
,
with
dark
eyes
and
dark
curly
hair
,
and
a
red
cloak
on
,
and
a
basket
on
her
arm
?
<EOS>
You
could
n't
forget
her
if
you
saw
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
;
Friday
was
a
fortnight
 
it
was
the
day
as
Dinah
went
away
 
there
<EOS>
come
nobody
.
<EOS>
There
's
ne'er
been
nobody
asking
for
her
till
you
come
,
for
the
folks
about
<EOS>
know
as
she
's
gone
.
<EOS>
Eh
dear
,
eh
dear
,
is
there
summat
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
woman
had
seen
the
ghastly
look
of
fear
in
Adam
's
face
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
stunned
or
confounded
:
he
was
thinking
eagerly
where
he
could
inquire
about
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
a
young
woman
started
from
our
country
to
see
Dinah
,
Friday
was
a
fortnight
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
fetch
her
back
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
something
has
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stop
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
hastened
out
of
the
cottage
,
and
the
old
woman
followed
him
to
the
gate
,
watching
him
sadly
with
her
shaking
head
as
he
almost
ran
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
inquire
at
the
place
where
the
Oakbourne
coach
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
No
young
woman
like
Hetty
had
been
seen
there
.
<EOS>
Had
any
accident
happened
to
the
coach
a
fortnight
ago
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
And
there
was
no
coach
to
take
him
back
to
Oakbourne
that
day
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
would
walk
:
<EOS>
he
could
n't
stay
here
,
in
wretched
inaction
.
<EOS>
But
the
innkeeper
,
seeing
that
Adam
was
in
great
anxiety
,
and
entering
into
this
new
incident
with
the
eagerness
of
a
man
who
passes
a
great
deal
of
time
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looking
into
an
obstinately
monotonous
street
,
offered
to
take
him
back
to
Oakbourne
in
his
own
"
taxed
cart
"
this
very
evening
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
five
o'clock
;
there
was
plenty
of
time
for
Adam
to
take
a
meal
and
yet
to
get
to
Oakbourne
before
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
The
innkeeper
declared
that
he
really
wanted
to
go
to
Oakbourne
,
and
might
as
well
go
to
-
night
;
he
should
have
all
Monday
before
him
then
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
after
making
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
eat
,
put
the
food
in
his
pocket
,
and
,
drinking
a
draught
of
ale
,
declared
himself
ready
to
set
off
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
cottage
,
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
do
well
to
learn
from
the
old
woman
where
Dinah
was
to
be
found
in
Leeds
:
if
there
was
trouble
at
the
Hall
Farm
 
<EOS>
he
only
half
-
admitted
the
foreboding
that
there
would
be
 
the
Poysers
might
like
to
send
for
Dinah
.
<EOS>
But
Dinah
had
not
left
any
address
,
and
the
old
woman
,
whose
memory
for
names
was
infirm
,
could
not
recall
the
name
of
the
"
blessed
woman
"
who
was
Dinah
's
chief
friend
in
the
Society
at
Leeds
.
  
<EOS>
During
that
long
,
long
journey
in
the
taxed
cart
,
there
was
time
for
all
the
conjectures
of
importunate
fear
and
struggling
hope
.
<EOS>
In
the
very
first
shock
of
discovering
that
Hetty
had
not
been
to
Snowfield
,
the
thought
of
Arthur
had
darted
through
Adam
like
a
sharp
pang
,
but
he
tried
for
some
time
to
ward
off
its
return
by
busying
himself
with
modes
of
accounting
for
the
alarming
fact
,
quite
apart
from
that
intolerable
thought
.
<EOS>
Some
accident
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Hetty
had
,
by
some
strange
chance
,
got
into
a
wrong
vehicle
from
Oakbourne
:
she
had
been
taken
ill
,
and
did
not
want
to
frighten
them
by
letting
them
know
.
<EOS>
But
this
frail
fence
of
vague
improbabilities
was
soon
hurled
down
by
a
rush
of
distinct
agonizing
fears
.
<EOS>
Hetty
had
been
deceiving
herself
in
thinking
that
she
could
love
and
marry
him
:
she
had
been
loving
Arthur
all
the
while
;
and
now
,
in
her
desperation
at
the
nearness
of
their
marriage
,
she
had
run
away
.
<EOS>
And
she
was
gone
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
old
indignation
and
jealousy
rose
again
,
and
prompted
the
suspicion
that
Arthur
had
been
dealing
falsely
 
had
written
to
Hetty
 
had
tempted
her
to
come
to
him
 
being
unwilling
,
after
all
,
that
she
should
belong
to
another
man
besides
himself
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
whole
thing
had
been
contrived
by
him
,
and
he
had
given
her
directions
how
to
follow
him
to
Ireland
 
for
Adam
knew
that
Arthur
had
been
gone
thither
three
weeks
ago
,
having
recently
learnt
it
at
the
Chase
.
<EOS>
Every
sad
look
of
Hetty
's
,
since
she
had
been
engaged
to
Adam
,
returned
upon
him
now
with
all
the
exaggeration
of
painful
retrospect
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
foolishly
sanguine
and
confident
.
<EOS>
The
poor
thing
had
n't
perhaps
known
her
own
mind
for
a
long
while
;
had
thought
that
she
could
forget
Arthur
;
had
been
momentarily
drawn
towards
the
man
who
offered
her
a
protecting
,
faithful
love
.
<EOS>
He
could
n't
bear
to
blame
her
:
she
never
meant
to
cause
him
this
dreadful
pain
.
<EOS>
The
blame
lay
with
that
man
who
had
selfishly
played
with
her
heart
 
had
perhaps
even
deliberately
lured
her
away
.
  
<EOS>
At
Oakbourne
,
the
ostler
at
the
Royal
Oak
remembered
such
a
young
woman
as
Adam
described
getting
out
of
the
Treddleston
coach
more
than
a
fortnight
ago
 
was
n't
likely
to
forget
such
a
pretty
lass
as
that
in
a
hurry
 
was
sure
she
had
not
gone
on
by
the
Buxton
coach
that
went
through
Snowfield
,
but
had
lost
sight
of
her
while
he
went
away
with
the
horses
and
had
never
set
eyes
on
her
again
.
<EOS>
Adam
then
went
straight
to
the
house
from
which
the
Stonition
coach
started
:
Stoniton
was
the
most
obvious
place
for
Hetty
to
go
to
first
<EOS>
,
whatever
might
be
her
destination
,
for
she
would
hardly
venture
on
any
but
the
chief
coach
-
roads
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
noticed
here
too
,
and
was
remembered
to
have
sat
on
the
box
by
the
coachman
;
but
the
coachman
could
not
be
seen
,
for
another
man
had
been
driving
on
that
road
in
his
stead
the
last
three
or
four
days
.
<EOS>
He
could
probably
be
seen
at
Stoniton
,
through
inquiry
at
the
inn
where
the
coach
put
up
.
<EOS>
So
the
anxious
heart
-
stricken
Adam
must
of
necessity
wait
and
try
to
rest
till
morning
 
<EOS>
nay
,
till
eleven
o'clock
,
when
the
coach
started
.
  
<EOS>
At
Stoniton
another
delay
occurred
,
for
the
old
coachman
who
had
driven
Hetty
would
not
be
in
the
town
again
till
night
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
come
he
remembered
Hetty
well
,
and
remembered
his
own
joke
addressed
to
her
,
quoting
it
many
times
to
Adam
,
and
observing
with
equal
frequency
that
he
thought
there
was
something
more
than
common
,
because
Hetty
had
not
laughed
when
he
joked
her
.
<EOS>
But
he
declared
,
as
the
people
had
done
at
the
inn
,
that
he
had
lost
sight
of
Hetty
directly
she
got
down
.
<EOS>
Part
of
the
next
morning
was
consumed
in
inquiries
at
every
house
in
the
town
from
which
a
coach
started
 
(
all
in
vain
,
for
you
know
<EOS>
Hetty
did
not
start
from
Stonition
by
coach
,
but
on
foot
in
the
grey
morning
)
 
<EOS>
and
then
in
walking
out
to
the
first
toll
-
gates
on
the
different
lines
of
road
,
in
the
forlorn
hope
of
finding
some
recollection
of
her
there
.
<EOS>
No
,
she
was
not
to
be
traced
any
farther
;
and
the
next
hard
task
for
Adam
was
to
go
home
and
carry
the
wretched
tidings
to
the
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
As
to
what
he
should
do
beyond
that
,
he
had
come
to
two
distinct
resolutions
amidst
the
tumult
of
thought
and
feeling
which
was
going
on
within
him
while
he
went
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
mention
what
he
knew
of
Arthur
Donnithorne
's
behaviour
to
Hetty
till
there
was
a
clear
necessity
for
it
:
it
was
still
possible
Hetty
might
come
back
,
and
the
disclosure
might
be
an
injury
or
an
offence
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
as
soon
as
he
had
been
home
and
done
what
was
necessary
there
to
prepare
for
his
further
absence
,
he
would
start
off
to
Ireland
:
if
he
found
no
trace
of
Hetty
on
the
road
,
he
would
go
straight
to
Arthur
Donnithorne
and
make
himself
certain
how
far
he
was
acquainted
with
her
movements
.
<EOS>
Several
times
the
thought
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
consult
Mr.
Irwine
,
but
that
would
be
useless
unless
he
told
him
all
,
and
so
betrayed
the
secret
about
Arthur
.
<EOS>
It
seems
strange
that
Adam
,
in
the
incessant
occupation
of
his
mind
about
Hetty
,
should
never
have
alighted
on
the
probability
that
she
had
gone
to
Windsor
,
ignorant
that
Arthur
was
no
longer
there
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
reason
was
that
he
could
not
conceive
Hetty
's
throwing
herself
on
Arthur
uncalled
;
he
imagined
no
cause
that
could
have
driven
her
to
such
a
step
,
after
that
letter
written
in
August
.
<EOS>
There
were
but
two
alternatives
in
his
mind
:
<EOS>
either
Arthur
had
written
to
her
again
and
enticed
her
away
,
or
she
had
simply
fled
from
her
approaching
marriage
with
himself
<EOS>
because
she
found
,
after
all
,
she
could
not
love
him
well
enough
,
and
yet
was
afraid
of
her
friends
'
anger
if
she
retracted
.
  
<EOS>
With
this
last
determination
on
his
mind
,
of
going
straight
to
Arthur
,
the
thought
that
he
had
spent
two
days
in
inquiries
which
had
proved
to
be
almost
useless
,
was
torturing
to
Adam
;
and
yet
,
since
he
would
not
tell
the
Poysers
his
conviction
as
to
where
Hetty
was
gone
,
or
his
intention
to
follow
her
thither
,
he
must
be
able
to
say
to
them
that
he
had
traced
her
as
far
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
after
twelve
o'clock
on
Tuesday
night
when
Adam
reached
Treddleston
;
and
,
unwilling
to
disturb
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
also
to
encounter
their
questions
at
that
hour
,
he
threw
himself
without
undressing
on
a
bed
at
the
"
Waggon
Overthrown
,
"
and
slept
hard
from
pure
weariness
.
<EOS>
Not
more
than
four
hours
,
however
,
for
before
five
o'clock
he
set
out
on
his
way
home
in
the
faint
morning
twilight
.
<EOS>
He
always
kept
a
key
of
the
workshop
door
in
his
pocket
,
so
that
he
could
let
himself
in
;
and
he
wished
to
enter
without
awaking
his
mother
,
for
he
was
anxious
to
avoid
telling
her
the
new
trouble
himself
by
seeing
Seth
first
,
and
asking
him
to
tell
her
when
it
should
be
necessary
.
<EOS>
He
walked
gently
along
the
yard
,
and
turned
the
key
gently
in
the
door
;
but
,
as
he
expected
,
Gyp
,
who
lay
in
the
workshop
,
gave
a
sharp
bark
.
<EOS>
It
subsided
when
he
saw
Adam
,
holding
up
his
finger
at
him
to
impose
silence
,
and
in
his
dumb
,
tailless
joy
he
must
content
himself
with
rubbing
his
body
against
his
master
's
legs
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
too
heart
-
sick
to
take
notice
of
Gyp
's
fondling
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
on
the
bench
and
stared
dully
at
the
wood
and
the
signs
of
work
around
him
,
wondering
if
he
should
ever
come
to
feel
pleasure
in
them
again
,
while
Gyp
,
dimly
aware
that
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
master
,
laid
his
rough
grey
head
on
Adam
's
knee
and
wrinkled
his
brows
to
look
up
at
him
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
,
since
Sunday
afternoon
,
Adam
had
been
constantly
among
strange
people
and
in
strange
places
,
having
no
associations
with
the
details
of
his
daily
life
,
and
now
that
by
the
light
of
this
new
morning
he
was
come
back
to
his
home
and
surrounded
by
the
familiar
objects
that
seemed
for
ever
robbed
of
their
charm
,
the
reality
 
<EOS>
the
hard
,
inevitable
reality
of
his
troubles
pressed
upon
him
with
a
new
weight
.
<EOS>
Right
before
him
was
an
unfinished
chest
of
drawers
,
which
he
had
been
making
in
spare
moments
for
Hetty
's
use
,
when
his
home
should
be
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
had
not
heard
Adam
's
entrance
,
but
he
had
been
roused
by
Gyp
's
bark
,
and
Adam
heard
him
moving
about
in
the
room
above
,
dressing
himself
.
<EOS>
Seth
's
first
thoughts
were
about
his
brother
:
he
would
come
home
to
-
day
,
surely
,
for
the
business
would
be
wanting
him
sadly
by
to
-
morrow
,
but
it
was
pleasant
to
think
he
had
had
a
longer
holiday
than
he
had
expected
.
<EOS>
And
would
Dinah
come
too
?
<EOS>
Seth
felt
that
that
was
the
greatest
happiness
he
could
look
forward
to
for
himself
,
though
he
had
no
hope
left
that
she
would
ever
love
him
well
enough
to
marry
him
;
but
he
had
often
said
to
himself
,
it
was
better
to
be
Dinah
's
friend
and
brother
than
any
other
woman
's
husband
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
but
be
always
near
her
,
instead
of
living
so
far
off
!
  
<EOS>
He
came
downstairs
and
opened
the
inner
door
leading
from
the
kitchen
into
the
workshop
,
intending
to
let
out
Gyp
;
but
he
stood
still
in
the
doorway
,
smitten
with
a
sudden
shock
at
the
sight
of
Adam
seated
listlessly
on
the
bench
,
pale
,
unwashed
,
with
sunken
blank
eyes
,
almost
like
a
drunkard
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
But
Seth
felt
in
an
instant
what
the
marks
meant
 
not
drunkenness
,
but
some
great
calamity
.
<EOS>
Adam
looked
up
at
him
without
speaking
,
and
Seth
moved
forward
towards
the
bench
,
himself
trembling
so
that
speech
did
not
come
readily
.
  
<EOS>
"
God
have
mercy
on

Addy
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
sitting
down
on
the
bench
beside
Adam
,
"
what
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
unable
to
speak
.
<EOS>
The
strong
man
,
accustomed
to
suppress
the
signs
of
sorrow
,
had
felt
his
heart
swell
like
a
child
's
at
this
first
approach
of
sympathy
.
<EOS>
He
fell
on
Seth
's
neck
and
sobbed
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
prepared
for
the
worst
now
,
for
,
even
in
his
recollections
of
their
boyhood
,
Adam
had
never
sobbed
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
death
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
Is
she
dead
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
low
tone
,
when
Adam
raised
his
head
and
was
recovering
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
lad
;
but
she
's
gone
 
<EOS>
gone
away
from
us
.
<EOS>
She
's
never
been
to
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
Dinah
's
been
gone
to
Leeds
ever
since
last
Friday
was
a
fortnight
,
the
very
day
Hetty
set
out
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
find
out
where
she
went
after
she
got
to
Stoniton
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
silent
from
utter
astonishment
:
he
knew
nothing
that
could
suggest
to
him
a
reason
for
Hetty
's
going
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hast
any
notion
what
she
's
done
it
for
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
ca
n't
ha
'
loved
me
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
like
our
marriage
when
it
came
nigh
 
<EOS>
that
must
be
it
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
had
determined
to
mention
no
further
reason
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
Mother
stirring
,
"
said
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
Must
we
tell
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
yet
,
"
said
Adam
,
rising
from
the
bench
and
pushing
the
hair
from
his
face
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
rouse
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
have
her
told
yet
;
and
I
must
set
out
on
another
journey
directly
,
after
I
've
been
to
the
village
and
th
'
Hall
Farm
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
tell
thee
where
I
'm
going
,
and
thee
must
say
to
her
<EOS>
I
'm
gone
on
business
as
nobody
is
to
know
anything
about
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
and
wash
myself
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
moved
towards
the
door
of
the
workshop
,
but
after
a
step
or
two
he
turned
round
,
and
,
meeting
Seth
's
eyes
with
a
calm
sad
glance
,
he
said
,
"
I
must
take
all
the
money
out
o
'
<EOS>
the
tin
box
,
lad
;
but
if
anything
happens
to
me
,
all
the
rest
'll
be
thine
,
to
take
care
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
Mother
with
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
pale
and
trembling
:
he
felt
there
was
some
terrible
secret
under
all
this
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Brother
,
"
he
said
,
faintly
 
he
never
called
Adam
"
Brother
"
except
in
solemn
moments
 
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
you
'll
do
anything
as
you
ca
n't
ask
God
's
blessing
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
lad
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
do
n't
be
afraid
.
<EOS>
I
'm
for
doing
nought
<EOS>
but
what
's
a
man
's
duty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
thought
that
if
he
betrayed
his
trouble
to
his
mother
,
she
would
only
distress
him
by
words
,
half
of
blundering
affection
,
half
of
irrepressible
triumph
that
Hetty
proved
as
unfit
to
be
his
wife
as
she
had
always
foreseen
,
brought
back
some
of
his
habitual
firmness
and
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
He
had
felt
ill
on
his
journey
home
 
<EOS>
he
told
her
when
she
came
down
 
had
stayed
all
night
at
Tredddleston
for
that
reason
;
and
a
bad
headache
,
that
still
hung
about
him
this
morning
,
accounted
for
his
paleness
and
heavy
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
He
determined
to
go
to
the
village
,
in
the
first
place
,
attend
to
his
business
for
an
hour
,
and
give
notice
to
Burge
of
his
being
obliged
to
go
on
a
journey
,
which
he
must
beg
him
not
to
mention
to
any
one
;
for
he
wished
to
avoid
going
to
the
Hall
Farm
near
breakfast
-
time
,
when
the
children
and
servants
would
be
in
the
house
-
place
,
and
there
must
be
exclamations
in
their
hearing
about
his
having
returned
without
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
waited
until
the
clock
struck
nine
before
he
left
the
work
-
yard
at
the
village
,
and
set
off
,
through
the
fields
,
towards
the
Farm
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
immense
relief
to
him
,
as
he
came
near
the
Home
Close
,
to
see
Mr.
Poyser
advancing
towards
him
,
for
this
would
spare
him
the
pain
of
going
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
was
walking
briskly
this
March
morning
,
with
a
sense
of
spring
business
on
his
mind
:
he
was
going
to
cast
the
master
's
eye
on
the
shoeing
of
a
new
cart
-
horse
,
carrying
his
spud
as
a
useful
companion
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
His
surprise
was
great
when
he
caught
sight
of
Adam
,
but
he
was
not
a
man
given
to
presentiments
of
evil
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Adam
,
lad
,
<EOS>
is't
you
?
<EOS>
Have
ye
been
all
this
time
away
and
not
brought
the
lasses
back
,
after
all
?
<EOS>
Where
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
I
've
not
brought
'
em
,
"
said
Adam
,
turning
round
,
to
indicate
that
he
wished
to
walk
back
with
Mr.
Poyser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Martin
,
looking
with
sharper
attention
at
Adam
,
"
ye
look
bad
.
<EOS>
Is
there
anything
happened
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Adam
,
heavily
.
<EOS>
"
A
sad
thing
's
happened
.
<EOS>
I
didna
find
Hetty
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
's
good
-
natured
face
showed
signs
of
troubled
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Not
find
her
?
<EOS>
What
's
happened
to
her
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
his
thoughts
flying
at
once
to
bodily
accident
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
I
ca
n't
tell
,
whether
anything
's
happened
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
never
went
to
Snowfield
 
<EOS>
she
took
the
coach
to
Stoniton
,
but
I
ca
n't
learn
nothing
of
her
after
she
got
down
from
the
Stoniton
coach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
donna
mean
she
's
run
away
?
<EOS>
"
said
Martin
,
standing
still
,
so
puzzled
and
bewildered
that
the
fact
did
not
yet
make
itself
felt
as
a
trouble
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
must
ha
'
done
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
n't
like
our
marriage
when
it
came
to
the
point
 
that
must
be
it
.
<EOS>
She
'd
mistook
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Martin
was
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
,
looking
on
the
ground
and
rooting
up
the
grass
with
his
spud
,
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
.
<EOS>
His
usual
slowness
was
always
trebled
when
the
subject
of
speech
was
painful
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
looked
up
,
right
in
Adam
's
face
,
saying
,
"
Then
she
didna
deserve
t
'
ha
'
ye
,
my
lad
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
I
feel
i
'
fault
myself
,
for
she
was
my
niece
,
and
I
was
allays
hot
for
her
marr'ing
ye
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
amends
I
can
make
ye
,
lad
 
<EOS>
the
more
's
the
pity
:
it
's
a
sad
cut
-
up
for
ye
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
could
say
nothing
;
and
Mr.
Poyser
,
after
pursuing
his
walk
for
a
little
while
,
went
on
,
"
I
'll
be
bound
she
's
gone
after
trying
to
get
a
lady
's
maid
's
place
,
for
she
'd
got
that
in
her
head
half
a
year
ago
,
and
wanted
me
to
gi
'
my
consent
.
<EOS>
But
I
'd
thought
better
on
her
"
 
he
added
,
shaking
his
head
slowly
and
sadly
 
<EOS>
"
I
'd
thought
better
on
her
,
nor
to
look
for
this
,
after
she
'd
gi'en
y
'
her
word
,
an
'
everything
been
got
ready
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
the
strongest
motives
for
encouraging
this
supposition
in
Mr.
Poyser
,
and
he
even
tried
to
believe
that
it
might
possibly
be
true
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
warrant
for
the
certainty
that
she
was
gone
to
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
better
it
should
be
so
,
"
he
said
,
as
quietly
as
he
could
,
"
if
she
felt
she
could
n't
like
me
for
a
husband
.
<EOS>
Better
run
away
before
than
repent
after
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
n't
look
harshly
on
her
if
she
comes
back
,
as
she
may
do
if
she
finds
it
hard
to
get
on
away
from
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
canna
look
on
her
as
I
've
done
before
,
"
said
Martin
decisively
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
acted
bad
by
you
,
and
by
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
not
turn
my
back
on
her
<EOS>
:
she
's
but
a
young
un
,
and
it
's
the
first
harm
I
've
knowed
on
her
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
a
hard
job
for
me
to
tell
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
Why
didna
Dinah
come
back
wi
'
ye
?
<EOS>
She
'd
ha
'
helped
to
pacify
her
aunt
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dinah
was
n't
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
She
's
been
gone
to
Leeds
this
fortnight
,
and
I
could
n't
learn
from
th
'
old
woman
any
direction
where
she
is
at
Leeds
,
<EOS>
else
I
should
ha
'
brought
it
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
'd
a
deal
better
be
staying
wi
'
her
own
kin
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
indignantly
,
"
than
going
preaching
among
strange
folks
<EOS>
a
-
that'n
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
leave
you
now
,
Mr.
Poyser
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
<EOS>
for
I
've
a
deal
to
see
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
you
'd
best
be
after
your
business
,
and
I
must
tell
the
missis
when
I
go
home
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
hard
job
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
beg
particular
<EOS>
,
you
'll
keep
what
's
happened
quiet
for
a
week
or
two
.
<EOS>
I
've
not
told
my
mother
yet
,
and
there
's
no
knowing
how
things
may
turn
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
;
least
said
,
soonest
mended
.
<EOS>
We'n
no
need
to
say
why
the
match
is
broke
off
,
an
'
we
may
hear
of
her
after
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
wi
'
me
,
lad
:
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
make
thee
amends
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
Martin
Poyser
's
throat
at
that
moment
which
caused
him
to
bring
out
those
scanty
words
in
rather
a
broken
fashion
.
<EOS>
Yet
Adam
knew
what
they
meant
all
the
better
,
and
the
two
honest
men
grasped
each
other
's
hard
hands
in
mutual
understanding
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
now
to
hinder
Adam
from
setting
off
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
Seth
to
go
to
the
Chase
and
leave
a
message
for
the
squire
,
saying
that
Adam
Bede
had
been
obliged
to
start
off
suddenly
on
a
journey
 
and
to
say
as
much
,
and
no
more
,
to
any
one
else
who
made
inquiries
about
him
.
<EOS>
If
the
Poysers
learned
that
he
was
gone
away
again
,
Adam
knew
they
would
infer
that
he
was
gone
in
search
of
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
intended
to
go
right
on
his
way
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
but
now
the
impulse
which
had
frequently
visited
him
before
 
to
go
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
and
make
a
confidant
of
him
 
recurred
with
the
new
force
which
belongs
to
a
last
opportunity
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
start
on
a
long
journey
 
a
difficult
one
 
by
sea
 
and
no
soul
would
know
where
he
was
gone
.
<EOS>
If
anything
happened
to
him
?
<EOS>
Or
,
if
he
absolutely
needed
help
in
any
matter
concerning
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
was
to
be
trusted
;
and
the
feeling
which
made
Adam
shrink
from
telling
anything
which
was
her
secret
must
give
way
before
the
need
there
was
that
she
should
have
some
one
else
besides
himself
who
would
be
prepared
to
defend
her
in
the
worst
extremity
.
<EOS>
Towards
Arthur
,
even
though
he
might
have
incurred
no
new
guilt
,
Adam
felt
that
he
was
not
bound
to
keep
silence
when
Hetty
's
interest
called
on
him
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
do
it
,
"
said
Adam
,
when
these
thoughts
,
which
had
spread
themselves
through
hours
of
his
sad
journeying
,
now
rushed
upon
him
in
an
instant
,
like
a
wave
that
had
been
slowly
gathering
;
"
it
's
the
right
thing
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
stand
alone
in
this
way
any
longer
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
Tidings
  
ADAM
turned
his
face
towards
Broxton
and
walked
with
his
swiftest
stride
,
looking
at
his
watch
with
the
fear
that
Mr.
Irwine
might
be
gone
out
 
hunting
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
The
fear
and
haste
together
produced
a
state
of
strong
excitement
before
he
reached
the
rectory
gate
,
and
outside
it
he
saw
the
deep
marks
of
a
recent
hoof
on
the
gravel
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
hoofs
were
turned
towards
the
gate
,
not
away
from
it
,
and
though
there
was
a
horse
against
the
stable
door
,
it
was
not
Mr.
Irwine
's
:
it
had
evidently
had
a
journey
this
morning
,
and
must
belong
to
some
one
who
had
come
on
business
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
was
at
home
,
then
;
but
Adam
could
hardly
find
breath
and
calmness
to
tell
Carroll
that
he
wanted
to
speak
to
the
rector
.
<EOS>
The
double
suffering
of
certain
and
uncertain
sorrow
had
begun
to
shake
the
strong
man
.
<EOS>
The
butler
looked
at
him
wonderingly
,
as
he
threw
himself
on
a
bench
in
the
passage
and
stared
absently
at
the
clock
on
the
opposite
wall
.
<EOS>
The
master
had
somebody
with
him
,
he
said
,
but
he
heard
the
study
door
open
 
<EOS>
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
coming
out
,
and
as
Adam
was
in
a
hurry
,
he
would
let
the
master
know
at
once
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
sat
looking
at
the
clock
:
the
minute
-
hand
was
hurrying
along
the
last
five
minutes
to
ten
with
a
loud
,
hard
,
indifferent
tick
,
and
Adam
watched
the
movement
and
listened
to
the
sound
as
if
he
had
had
some
reason
for
doing
so
.
<EOS>
In
our
times
of
bitter
suffering
there
are
almost
always
these
pauses
,
when
our
consciousness
is
benumbed
to
everything
but
some
trivial
perception
or
sensation
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
if
semi
-
idiocy
came
to
give
us
rest
from
the
memory
and
the
dread
which
refuse
to
leave
us
in
our
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
Carroll
,
coming
back
,
recalled
Adam
to
the
sense
of
his
burden
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
go
into
the
study
immediately
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
think
what
that
strange
person
's
come
about
,
"
the
butler
added
,
from
mere
incontinence
of
remark
,
as
he
preceded
Adam
to
the
door
,
"
he
's
gone
<EOS>
i
'
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
And
master
looks
unaccountable
 
as
if
he
was
frightened
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
took
no
notice
of
the
words
:
he
could
not
care
about
other
people
's
business
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
entered
the
study
and
looked
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
,
he
felt
in
an
instant
that
there
was
a
new
expression
in
it
,
strangely
different
from
the
warm
friendliness
it
had
always
worn
for
him
before
.
<EOS>
A
letter
lay
open
on
the
table
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
's
hand
was
on
it
,
but
the
changed
glance
he
cast
on
Adam
could
not
be
owing
entirely
to
preoccupation
with
some
disagreeable
business
,
for
he
was
looking
eagerly
towards
the
door
,
as
if
Adam
's
entrance
were
a
matter
of
poignant
anxiety
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
want
to
speak
to
me
,
Adam
,
"
he
said
,
in
that
low
constrainedly
quiet
tone
which
a
man
uses
when
he
is
determined
to
suppress
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
a
chair
just
opposite
to
him
,
at
no
more
than
a
yard
's
distance
from
his
own
,
and
Adam
sat
down
with
a
sense
that
this
cold
manner
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
gave
an
additional
unexpected
difficulty
to
his
disclosure
.
<EOS>
But
when
Adam
had
made
up
his
mind
to
a
measure
,
he
was
not
the
man
to
renounce
it
for
any
but
imperative
reasons
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
come
to
you
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
the
gentleman
I
look
up
to
most
of
anybody
.
<EOS>
I
've
something
very
painful
to
tell
you
 
something
as
it
'll
pain
you
to
hear
as
well
as
<EOS>
me
to
tell
.
<EOS>
But
if
I
speak
o
'
the
wrong
other
people
have
done
,
you
'll
see
I
did
n't
speak
till
I
'd
good
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
nodded
slowly
,
and
Adam
went
on
rather
tremulously
,
"
You
was
t
'
ha
'
married
me
and
Hetty
Sorrel
,
you
know
,
sir
<EOS>
,
o
'
the
fifteenth
o
'
this
month
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
loved
me
,
and
I
was
th
'
happiest
man
<EOS>
i
'
the
parish
.
<EOS>
But
a
dreadful
blow
's
come
upon
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
started
up
from
his
chair
,
as
if
involuntarily
,
but
then
,
determined
to
control
himself
,
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
gone
away
,
sir
,
and
we
do
n't
know
where
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
was
going
to
Snowfield
o
'
<EOS>
Friday
was
a
fortnight
,
and
I
went
last
Sunday
to
fetch
her
back
;
but
she
'd
never
been
there
,
and
she
took
the
coach
to
Stoniton
,
and
beyond
that
I
ca
n't
trace
her
.
<EOS>
But
now
I
'm
going
a
long
journey
to
look
for
her
,
and
I
ca
n't
trust
t
'
anybody
<EOS>
but
you
where
I
'm
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
came
back
from
the
window
and
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
idea
of
the
reason
why
she
went
away
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
plain
enough
she
did
n't
want
to
marry
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
n't
like
it
when
it
came
so
near
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
n't
all
,
I
doubt
.
<EOS>
There
's
something
else
I
must
tell
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
There
's
somebody
else
concerned
besides
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
gleam
of
something
 
<EOS>
it
was
almost
like
relief
or
joy
 
<EOS>
came
across
the
eager
anxiety
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
looking
on
the
ground
,
and
paused
a
little
:
the
next
words
were
hard
to
speak
.
<EOS>
But
when
he
went
on
,
he
lifted
up
his
head
and
looked
straight
at
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
He
would
do
the
thing
he
had
resolved
to
do
,
without
flinching
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
who
's
the
man
I
've
reckoned
my
greatest
friend
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
used
to
be
proud
to
think
as
I
should
pass
my
life
<EOS>
i
'
working
for
him
,
and
had
felt
so
ever
since
we
were
lads
....
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
if
all
self
-
control
had
forsaken
him
,
grasped
Adam
's
arm
,
which
lay
on
the
table
,
and
,
clutching
it
tightly
like
a
man
in
pain
,
said
,
with
pale
lips
and
a
low
hurried
voice
,
"
<EOS>
No
,
Adam
,
no
 
do
n't
say
it
,
for
God
's
sake
!
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
,
surprised
at
the
violence
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
feeling
,
repented
of
the
words
that
had
passed
his
lips
and
sat
in
distressed
silence
.
<EOS>
The
grasp
on
his
arm
gradually
relaxed
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
saying
,
"
Go
on
 
I
must
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
man
played
with
Hetty
's
feelings
,
and
behaved
to
her
as
he
'd
no
right
to
do
to
a
girl
in
her
station
o
'
life
 
made
her
presents
and
used
to
go
and
meet
her
out
a
-
walking
.
<EOS>
I
found
it
out
only
two
days
before
he
went
away
 
<EOS>
found
him
a
-
kissing
her
as
they
were
parting
in
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
There
'd
been
nothing
said
between
me
and
Hetty
then
,
though
I
'd
loved
her
for
a
long
while
,
and
she
knew
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
reproached
him
with
his
wrong
actions
,
and
words
and
blows
passed
between
us
;
and
he
said
solemnly
to
me
,
after
that
,
as
it
had
been
all
nonsense
and
no
more
than
a
bit
o
'
flirting
.
<EOS>
But
I
made
him
write
a
letter
to
tell
Hetty
he
'd
meant
nothing
,
for
I
saw
clear
enough
,
sir
,
by
several
things
as
I
had
n't
understood
at
the
time
,
as
he
'd
got
hold
of
her
heart
,
and
I
thought
she
'd
belike
go
on
thinking
of
him
and
never
come
to
love
another
man
as
wanted
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
And
I
gave
her
the
letter
,
and
she
seemed
to
bear
it
all
after
a
while
better
than
I
'd
expected
...
<EOS>
and
she
behaved
kinder
and
kinder
to
me
...
<EOS>
I
daresay
she
did
n't
know
her
own
feelings
then
,
poor
thing
,
and
they
came
back
upon
her
when
it
was
too
late
...
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
blame
her
...
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
as
she
meant
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
encouraged
to
think
she
loved
me
,
and
 
you
know
the
rest
,
sir
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
on
my
mind
as
he
's
been
false
to
me
,
and
'
ticed
her
away
,
and
she
's
gone
to
him
 
<EOS>
and
I
'm
going
now
to
see
,
<EOS>
for
I
can
never
go
to
work
again
till
I
know
what
's
become
of
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
During
Adam
's
narrative
,
Mr.
Irwine
had
had
time
to
recover
his
self
-
mastery
in
spite
of
the
painful
thoughts
that
crowded
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
bitter
remembrance
to
him
now
 
that
morning
when
Arthur
breakfasted
with
him
and
seemed
as
if
he
were
on
the
verge
of
a
confession
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
enough
now
what
he
had
wanted
to
confess
.
<EOS>
And
if
their
words
had
taken
another
turn
...
if
he
himself
had
been
less
fastidious
about
intruding
on
another
man
's
secrets
...
it
was
cruel
to
think
how
thin
a
film
had
shut
out
rescue
from
all
this
guilt
and
misery
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
whole
history
now
by
that
terrible
illumination
which
the
present
sheds
back
upon
the
past
.
<EOS>
But
every
other
feeling
as
it
rushed
upon
his
was
thrown
into
abeyance
by
pity
,
deep
respectful
pity
,
for
the
man
who
sat
before
him
 
already
so
bruised
,
going
forth
with
sad
blind
resignedness
to
an
unreal
sorrow
,
while
a
real
one
was
close
upon
him
,
too
far
beyond
the
range
of
common
trial
for
him
ever
to
have
feared
it
.
<EOS>
His
own
agitation
was
quelled
by
a
certain
awe
that
comes
over
us
in
the
presence
of
a
great
anguish
,
for
the
anguish
he
must
inflict
on
Adam
was
already
present
to
him
.
<EOS>
Again
he
put
his
hand
on
the
arm
that
lay
on
the
table
,
but
very
gently
this
time
,
as
he
said
solemnly
:
  
"
Adam
,
my
dear
friend
,
you
have
had
some
hard
trials
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
You
can
bear
sorrow
manfully
,
as
well
as
act
manfully
.
<EOS>
God
requires
both
tasks
at
our
hands
.
<EOS>
And
there
is
a
heavier
sorrow
coming
upon
you
than
any
you
have
yet
known
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
not
guilty
 
<EOS>
you
have
not
the
worst
of
all
sorrows
.
<EOS>
God
help
him
who
has
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
two
pale
faces
looked
at
each
other
;
in
Adam
's
there
was
trembling
suspense
,
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
hesitating
,
shrinking
pity
.
<EOS>
But
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
news
of
Hetty
this
morning
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
gone
to
him
.
<EOS>
She
is
in
Stonyshire
 
at
Stoniton
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
started
up
from
his
chair
,
as
if
he
thought
he
could
have
leaped
to
her
that
moment
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Irwine
laid
hold
of
his
arm
again
and
said
,
persuasively
,
"
Wait
,
Adam
,
wait
.
"
<EOS>
So
he
sat
down
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
a
very
unhappy
position
 
one
which
will
make
it
worse
for
you
to
find
her
,
my
poor
friend
,
than
to
have
lost
her
for
ever
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
's
lips
moved
tremulously
,
but
no
sound
came
.
<EOS>
They
moved
again
,
and
he
whispered
,
"
Tell
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
been
arrested
...
<EOS>
she
is
in
prison
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
an
insulting
blow
had
brought
back
the
spirit
of
resistance
into
Adam
.
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
his
face
,
and
he
said
,
loudly
and
sharply
,
"
<EOS>
For
what
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
a
great
crime
 
the
murder
of
her
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
CAN'T
BE
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
almost
shouted
,
starting
up
from
his
chair
and
making
a
stride
towards
the
door
;
but
he
turned
round
again
,
setting
his
back
against
the
bookcase
,
and
looking
fiercely
at
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
n't
possible
.
<EOS>
She
never
had
a
child
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
be
guilty
.
<EOS>
WHO
says
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
grant
<EOS>
she
may
be
innocent
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
We
can
still
hope
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
who
says
she
is
guilty
?
"
said
Adam
violently
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
letter
from
the
magistrate
before
whom
she
was
taken
,
and
the
constable
who
arrested
her
is
in
the
dining
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
will
not
confess
her
name
or
where
she
comes
from
;
but
I
fear
,
I
fear
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
it
is
Hetty
.
<EOS>
The
description
of
her
person
corresponds
,
only
that
she
is
said
to
look
very
pale
and
ill
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
small
red
-
leather
pocket
-
book
in
her
pocket
with
two
names
written
in
it
 
one
at
the
beginning
,
"
Hetty
Sorrel
,
Hayslope
,
"
and
the
other
near
the
end
,
"
Dinah
Morris
,
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
not
say
which
is
her
own
name
 
<EOS>
she
denies
everything
,
and
will
answer
no
questions
,
and
application
has
been
made
to
me
,
as
a
magistrate
,
that
I
may
take
measures
for
identifying
her
,
for
it
was
thought
probable
that
the
name
which
stands
first
is
her
own
name
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
what
proof
have
they
got
against
her
,
if
it
IS
Hetty
?
"
said
Adam
,
still
violently
,
with
an
effort
that
seemed
to
shake
his
whole
frame
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
It
could
n't
ha
'
been
,
and
none
of
us
know
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Terrible
proof
that
she
was
under
the
temptation
to
commit
the
crime
;
but
we
have
room
to
hope
that
she
did
not
really
commit
it
.
<EOS>
Try
and
read
that
letter
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
took
the
letter
between
his
shaking
hands
and
tried
to
fix
his
eyes
steadily
on
it
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
meanwhile
went
out
to
give
some
orders
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
back
,
Adam
's
eyes
were
still
on
the
first
page
 
<EOS>
he
could
n't
read
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
put
the
words
together
and
make
out
what
they
meant
.
<EOS>
He
threw
it
down
at
last
and
clenched
his
fist
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
HIS
doing
,
"
he
said
;
"
if
there
's
been
any
crime
,
it
's
at
his
door
,
not
at
hers
.
<EOS>
HE
taught
her
to
deceive
 
HE
<EOS>
deceived
me
first
.
<EOS>
Let
'em
put
HIM
on
his
trial
 
<EOS>
let
him
stand
in
court
beside
her
,
and
I
'll
tell
'em
how
he
got
hold
of
her
heart
,
and
'
ticed
her
t
'
evil
,
and
then
lied
to
me
.
<EOS>
Is
HE
to
go
free
,
while
they
lay
all
the
punishment
on
her
...
<EOS>
so
weak
and
young
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
image
called
up
by
these
last
words
gave
a
new
direction
to
poor
Adam
's
maddened
feelings
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
,
looking
at
the
corner
of
the
room
as
if
he
saw
something
there
.
<EOS>
Then
he
burst
out
again
,
in
a
tone
of
appealing
anguish
,
"
I
ca
n't
bear
it
...
<EOS>
O
God
,
it
's
too
hard
to
lay
upon
me
 
<EOS>
it
's
too
hard
to
think
she
's
wicked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
had
sat
down
again
in
silence
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
wise
to
utter
soothing
words
at
present
,
and
indeed
,
the
sight
of
Adam
before
him
,
with
that
look
of
sudden
age
which
sometimes
comes
over
a
young
face
in
moments
of
terrible
emotion
 
the
hard
bloodless
look
of
the
skin
,
the
deep
lines
about
the
quivering
mouth
,
the
furrows
in
the
brow
 
<EOS>
the
sight
of
this
strong
firm
man
shattered
by
the
invisible
stroke
of
sorrow
,
moved
him
so
deeply
that
speech
was
not
easy
.
<EOS>
Adam
stood
motionless
,
with
his
eyes
vacantly
fixed
in
this
way
for
a
minute
or
two
;
in
that
short
space
he
was
living
through
all
his
love
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
ha
'
done
it
,
"
he
said
,
still
without
moving
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
were
only
talking
to
himself
:
"
it
was
fear
made
her
hide
it
...
<EOS>
I
forgive
her
for
deceiving
me
...
<EOS>
I
forgive
thee
,
Hetty
...
<EOS>
thee
wast
deceived
too
...
<EOS>
it
's
gone
hard
wi
'
thee
,
my
poor
Hetty
...
<EOS>
but
they
'll
never
make
me
believe
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
silent
again
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
he
said
,
with
fierce
abruptness
,
"
I
'll
go
to
him
 
<EOS>
I
'll
bring
him
back
 
<EOS>
I
'll
make
him
go
and
look
at
her
in
her
misery
 
<EOS>
he
shall
look
at
her
till
he
ca
n't
forget
it
 
<EOS>
it
shall
follow
him
night
and
day
 
as
long
as
he
lives
it
shall
follow
him
 
<EOS>
he
sha
n't
escape
wi
'
lies
this
time
 
<EOS>
I
'll
fetch
him
<EOS>
,
I
'll
drag
him
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
act
of
going
towards
the
door
,
Adam
paused
automatically
and
looked
about
for
his
hat
,
quite
unconscious
where
he
was
or
who
was
present
with
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
had
followed
him
,
and
now
took
him
by
the
arm
,
saying
,
in
a
quiet
but
decided
tone
,
"
No
,
Adam
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
'm
sure
you
will
wish
to
stay
and
see
what
good
can
be
done
for
her
,
instead
of
going
on
a
useless
errand
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
The
punishment
will
surely
fall
without
your
aid
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
is
no
longer
in
Ireland
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
on
his
way
home
 
or
would
be
,
long
before
you
arrived
,
for
his
grandfather
,
I
know
,
wrote
for
him
to
come
at
least
ten
days
ago
.
<EOS>
I
want
you
now
to
go
with
me
to
Stoniton
.
<EOS>
I
have
ordered
a
horse
for
you
to
ride
with
us
,
as
soon
as
you
can
compose
yourself
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
Mr.
Irwine
was
speaking
,
Adam
recovered
his
consciousness
of
the
actual
scene
.
<EOS>
He
rubbed
his
hair
off
his
forehead
and
listened
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
,
"
Mr.
Irwine
went
on
,
"
there
are
others
to
think
of
,
and
act
for
,
besides
yourself
,
Adam
:
there
are
Hetty
's
friends
,
the
good
Poysers
,
on
whom
this
stroke
will
fall
more
heavily
than
I
can
bear
to
think
.
<EOS>
I
expect
it
from
your
strength
of
mind
,
<EOS>
Adam
 
from
your
sense
of
duty
to
God
and
man
 
that
you
will
try
to
act
as
long
as
action
can
be
of
any
use
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
reality
,
Mr.
Irwine
proposed
this
journey
to
Stoniton
for
Adam
's
own
sake
.
<EOS>
Movement
,
with
some
object
before
him
,
was
the
best
means
of
counteracting
the
violence
of
suffering
in
these
first
hours
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
go
with
me
to
Stoniton
,
Adam
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
again
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
to
see
if
it
is
really
Hetty
who
is
there
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
'll
do
what
you
think
right
.
<EOS>
But
the
folks
at
th
'
Hall
Farm
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
them
not
to
know
till
I
return
to
tell
them
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
ascertained
things
then
which
I
am
uncertain
about
now
,
and
I
shall
return
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Come
now
,
the
horses
are
ready
.

<EOS>
MR

<EOS>
IRWINE
returned
from
Stoniton
in
a
post
-
chaise
that
night
,
and
the
first
words
Carroll
said
to
him
,
as
he
entered
the
house
,
were
,
that
Squire
Donnithorne
was
dead
 
<EOS>
found
dead
in
his
bed
at
ten
o'clock
that
morning
 
and
that
Mrs.
Irwine
desired
him
to
say
she
should
be
awake
when
Mr.
Irwine
came
home
,
and
she
begged
him
not
to
go
to
bed
without
seeing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Dauphin
,
"
Mrs.
Irwine
said
,
as
her
son
entered
her
room
,
"
you
're
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
So
the
old
gentleman
's
fidgetiness
and
low
spirits
,
which
made
him
send
for
Arthur
in
that
sudden
way
,
really
meant
something
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
Carroll
has
told
you
that
Donnithorne
was
found
dead
in
his
bed
this
morning
.
<EOS>
You
will
believe
my
prognostications
another
time
,
though
I
daresay
I
sha
n't
live
to
prognosticate
anything
<EOS>
but
my
own
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
have
they
done
about
Arthur
?
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
Sent
a
messenger
to
await
him
at
Liverpool
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Ralph
was
gone
before
the
news
was
brought
to
us
.
<EOS>
Dear
Arthur
,
I
shall
live
now
to
see
him
master
at
the
Chase
,
and
making
good
times
on
the
estate
,
like
a
generous
-
hearted
fellow
as
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
as
happy
as
a
king
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
could
not
help
giving
a
slight
groan
:
he
was
worn
with
anxiety
and
exertion
,
and
his
mother
's
light
words
were
almost
intolerable
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
so
dismal
about
,
Dauphin
?
<EOS>
Is
there
any
bad
news
?
<EOS>
Or
are
you
thinking
of
the
danger
for
Arthur
in
crossing
that
frightful
Irish
Channel
at
this
time
of
year
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
Mother
,
I
'm
not
thinking
of
that
;
but
I
'm
not
prepared
to
rejoice
just
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
've
been
worried
by
this
law
business
that
you
've
been
to
Stoniton
about
.
<EOS>
What
in
the
world
is
it
,
that
you
ca
n't
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
know
by
and
by
,
mother
.
<EOS>
It
would
not
be
right
for
me
to
tell
you
at
present
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
<EOS>
:
you
'll
sleep
now
you
have
no
longer
anything
to
listen
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
gave
up
his
intention
of
sending
a
letter
to
meet
Arthur
,
since
it
would
not
now
hasten
his
return
:
the
news
of
his
grandfather
's
death
would
bring
him
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
come
.
<EOS>
He
could
go
to
bed
now
and
get
some
needful
rest
,
before
the
time
came
for
the
morning
's
heavy
duty
of
carrying
his
sickening
news
to
the
Hall
Farm
and
to
Adam
's
home
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
himself
was
not
come
back
from
Stoniton
,
for
though
he
shrank
from
seeing
Hetty
,
he
could
not
bear
to
go
to
a
distance
from
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
no
use
,
sir
,
"
he
said
to
the
rector
,
"
it
's
no
use
for
me
to
go
back
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
go
to
work
again
while
she
's
here
,
and
I
could
n't
bear
the
sight
<EOS>
o
'
the
things
and
folks
round
home
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
a
bit
of
a
room
here
,
where
I
can
see
the
prison
walls
,
and
perhaps
I
shall
get
,
in
time
,
to
bear
seeing
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
not
been
shaken
in
his
belief
that
Hetty
was
innocent
of
the
crime
she
was
charged
with
,
for
Mr.
Irwine
,
feeling
that
the
belief
in
her
guilt
would
be
a
crushing
addition
to
Adam
's
load
,
had
kept
from
him
the
facts
which
left
no
hope
in
his
own
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
any
reason
for
thrusting
the
whole
burden
on
Adam
at
once
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
,
at
parting
,
only
said
,
"
If
the
evidence
should
tell
too
strongly
against
her
,
Adam
,
we
may
still
hope
for
a
pardon
.
<EOS>
Her
youth
and
other
circumstances
will
be
a
plea
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
and
it
's
right
people
should
know
how
she
was
tempted
into
the
wrong
way
,
"
said
Adam
,
with
bitter
earnestness
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
right
they
should
know
it
was
a
fine
gentleman
made
love
to
her
,
and
turned
her
head
wi
'
notions
.
<EOS>
You
'll
remember
,
sir
,
you
've
promised
to
tell
my
mother
,
and
Seth
,
and
the
people
at
the
farm
,
who
it
was
as
led
her
wrong
,
else
they
'll
think
harder
of
her
than
she
deserves
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
doing
her
a
hurt
by
sparing
him
,
and
I
hold
him
the
guiltiest
before
God
,
let
her
ha
'
done
what
she
may
.
<EOS>
If
you
spare
him
,
I
'll
expose
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
your
demand
is
just
,
Adam
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
"
<EOS>
but
when
you
are
calmer
,
you
will
judge
Arthur
more
mercifully
.
<EOS>
I
say
nothing
now
,
only
that
his
punishment
is
in
other
hands
than
ours
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
felt
it
hard
upon
him
that
he
should
have
to
tell
of
Arthur
's
sad
part
in
the
story
of
sin
and
<EOS>
sorrow
 
he
who
cared
for
Arthur
with
fatherly
affection
,
who
had
cared
for
him
with
fatherly
pride
.
<EOS>
But
he
saw
clearly
that
the
secret
must
be
known
before
long
,
even
apart
from
Adam
's
determination
,
since
it
was
scarcely
to
be
supposed
that
Hetty
would
persist
to
the
end
in
her
obstinate
silence
.
<EOS>
He
made
up
his
mind
to
withhold
nothing
from
the
Poysers
,
but
to
tell
them
the
worst
at
once
,
for
there
was
no
time
to
rob
the
tidings
of
their
suddenness
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
trial
must
come
on
at
the
Lent
assizes
,
and
they
were
to
be
held
at
Stoniton
the
next
week
.
<EOS>
It
was
scarcely
to
be
hoped
that
Martin
Poyser
could
escape
the
pain
of
being
called
as
a
witness
,
and
it
was
better
he
should
know
everything
as
long
beforehand
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
Before
ten
o'clock
on
Thursday
morning
the
home
at
the
Hall
Farm
was
a
house
of
mourning
for
a
misfortune
felt
to
be
worse
than
death
.
<EOS>
The
sense
of
family
dishonour
was
too
keen
even
in
the
kind
-
hearted
Martin
Poyser
the
younger
to
leave
room
for
any
compassion
towards
Hetty
.
<EOS>
He
and
his
father
were
simple
-
minded
farmers
,
proud
of
their
untarnished
character
,
proud
that
they
came
of
a
family
which
had
held
up
its
head
and
paid
its
way
as
far
back
as
its
name
was
in
the
parish
register
;
and
Hetty
had
brought
disgrace
on
them
all
 
disgrace
that
could
never
be
wiped
out
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
all
-
conquering
feeling
in
the
mind
both
of
father
and
son
 
the
scorching
sense
of
disgrace
,
which
neutralised
all
other
sensibility
 
and
Mr.
Irwine
was
struck
with
surprise
to
observe
that
Mrs.
Poyser
was
less
severe
than
her
husband
.
<EOS>
We
are
often
startled
by
the
severity
of
mild
people
on
exceptional
occasions
;
the
reason
is
,
that
mild
people
are
most
liable
to
be
under
the
yoke
of
traditional
impressions
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
willing
to
pay
any
money
as
is
wanted
towards
trying
to
bring
her
off
,
"
said
Martin
the
younger
when
Mr.
Irwine
was
gone
,
while
the
old
grandfather
was
crying
in
the
opposite
chair
,
"
but
I
'll
not
go
nigh
her
,
nor
ever
see
her
again
,
by
my
own
will
.
<EOS>
She
's
made
our
bread
bitter
to
us
for
all
our
lives
to
come
,
an
'
we
shall
ne'er
hold
up
our
heads
<EOS>
i
'
this
parish
nor
<EOS>
i

<EOS>
The
parson
talks
o
'
folks
pitying
us
:
it
's
poor
amends
pity
'
ull
make

"
  
<EOS>
"
Pity
?
"
said
the
grandfather
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
ne'er
wanted
folks
's
pity

MY
life

<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
fret
so
,
father
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
had
spoken
very
little
,
being
almost
overawed
by
her
husband
's
unusual
hardness
and
decision
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
have

Ah

Mr.
Poyser

the
hard
tears
trickled
slowly
down
his
round
cheeks

<EOS>
"
We
thought
it

be
bad
luck

We

better
ha

sent
for
Dinah

if
we
'd
known
where

said
Mr.
Poyser
;

Adam

<EOS>
"
Why

wi

that
woman

Aunt

Mrs.

comforted
a
little
by
this
suggestion
of
her
husbands

But
there
's
Seth
Bede

a

<EOS>

<EOS>
Before
Alick
arrived
with
the
message
,
Lisbeth
's
thoughts
too
had
already
flown
to
Dinah
,
and
she
had
said
to
Seth
,
"
Eh

Thee

said
Seth
,
as
his
mother
sobbed
and
rocked
herself
to
and
fro
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fetch
her
?
"
<EOS>
said
Lisbeth
,
looking
up
and
pausing
from
her
grief
,
like
a
crying
child
who
hears
some
promise
of
consolation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
what
place
<EOS>
is't

at

do
they
say

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
good
way
off

Leeds

a

But
I

<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
sure
where
she
'd
be

that
big

said
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
If

'd
gone
myself

I
could
ha

found
out
by
asking

<EOS>
But
perhaps
if
I
put
Sarah
Williamson
,
Methodist
preacher
,
Leeds
,
o

th

it

get

Sarah

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Alick
came
now
with
the
message
,
and
Seth
,
finding
that
Mrs.
Poyser
was
writing
to
Dinah
,
gave
up
the
intention
of
writing
himself
;
but
he
went
to
the
Hall
Farm
to
tell
them
all
he
could
suggest
about
the
address
of
the
letter
,
and
warn
them
that
there
might
be
some
delay
in
the
delivery
,
from
his
not
knowing
an
exact
direction
.
  
<EOS>
On
leaving
Lisbeth
,
Mr.
Irwine
had
gone
to
Jonathan
Burge
,
who
had
also
a
claim
to
be
acquainted
with
what
was
likely
to
keep
Adam
away
from
business
for
some
time
;
and
before
six
o'clock
that
evening
there
were
few
people
in
Broxton
and
Hayslope
who
had
not
heard
the
sad
news
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
had
not
mentioned
Arthur
's
name
to
Burge
,
and
yet
the
story
of
his
conduct
towards
Hetty
,
with
all
the
dark
shadows
cast
upon
it
by
its
terrible
consequences
,
was
presently
as
well
known
as
that
his
grandfather
was
dead
,
and
that
he
was
come
into
the
estate
.
<EOS>
For
Martin
Poyser
felt
no
motive
to
keep
silence
towards
the
one
or
two
neighbours
who
ventured
to
come
and
shake
him
sorrowfully
by
the
hand
on
the
first
day
of
his
trouble
;
and
Carroll
,
who
kept
his
ears
open
to
all
that
passed
at
the
rectory
,
had
framed
an
inferential
version
of
the
story
,
and
found
early
opportunities
of
communicating
it
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
those
neighbours
who
came
to
Martin
Poyser
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
without
speaking
for
some
minutes
was
Bartle
Massey
.
<EOS>
He
had
shut
up
his
school
,
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
rectory
,
where
he
arrived
about
half
-
past
seven
in
the
evening
,
and
,
sending
his
duty
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
begged
pardon
for
troubling
him
at
that
hour
,
but
had
something
particular
on
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
was
shown
into
the
study
,
where
Mr.
Irwine
soon
joined
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Bartle
?
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
putting
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
That
was
not
his
usual
way
of
saluting
the
schoolmaster
,
but
trouble
makes
us
treat
all
who
feel
with
us
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
I
'm
come
about
as
well
as
I
do
,
sir
,
I
daresay
,
"
said
Bartle
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
wish
to
know
the
truth
about
the
sad
news
that
has
reached
you
...
about
Hetty
Sorrel
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
sir
,
what
I
wish
to
know
is
about
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
I
understand
you
left
him
at
Stoniton
,
and
I
beg
the
favour
of
you
to
tell
me
what
's
the
state
of
the
poor
lad
's
mind
,
and
what
he
means
to
do
.
<EOS>
For
as
for
that
bit
o
'
pink
-
and
-
white
they
've
taken
the
trouble
to
put
in
jail
,
I
do
n't
value
her
a
rotten
nut
 
not
a
rotten
nut
 
only
for
the
harm
or
good
that
may
come
out
of
her
to
an
honest
man
 
a
lad
I
've
set
such
store
by
 
trusted
to
,
that
he
'd
make
my
bit
<EOS>
o
'
knowledge
go
a
good
way
in
the
world
....
<EOS>
Why
,
sir
,
he
's
the
only
scholar
I
've
had
in
this
stupid
country
that
ever
had
the
will
or
the
head
-
piece
for
mathematics
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
n't
had
so
much
hard
work
to
do
,
poor
fellow
,
he
might
have
gone
into
the
higher
branches
,
and
then
this
might
never
have
happened
 
might
never
have
happened
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bartle
was
heated
by
the
exertion
of
walking
fast
in
an
agitated
frame
of
mind
,
and
was
not
able
to
check
himself
on
this
first
occasion
of
venting
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
he
paused
now
to
rub
his
moist
forehead
,
and
probably
his
moist
eyes
also
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
'll
excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
when
this
pause
had
given
him
time
to
reflect
,
"
for
running
on
in
this
way
about
my
own
feelings
,
like
that
foolish
dog
of
mine
howling
in
a
storm
,
when
there
's
nobody
wants
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
came
to
hear
you
speak
,
not
to
talk
myself
 
if
you
'll
take
the
trouble
to
tell
me
what
the
poor
lad
's
doing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
put
yourself
under
any
restraint
,
Bartle
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
The
fact
is
,
I
'm
very
much
in
the
same
condition
as
you
just
now
;
I
've
a
great
deal
that
's
painful
on
my
mind
,
and
I
find
it
hard
work
to
be
quite
silent
about
my
own
feelings
and
only
attend
to
others
.
<EOS>
I
share
your
concern
for
Adam
,
though
he
is
not
the
only
one
whose
sufferings
I
care
for
in
this
affair
.
<EOS>
He
intends
to
remain
at
Stoniton
till
after
the
trial
:
it
will
come
on
probably
a
week
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
has
taken
a
room
there
,
and
I
encouraged
him
to
do
so
,
because
I
think
it
better
he
should
be
away
from
his
own
home
at
present
;
and
,
poor
fellow
,
he
still
believes
Hetty
is
innocent
 
<EOS>
he
wants
to
summon
up
courage
to
see
her
if
he
can
;
he
is
unwilling
to
leave
the
spot
where
she
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
the
creatur
's
guilty
,
then
?
"
said
Bartle
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
'll
hang
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
afraid
it
will
go
hard
with
her
.
<EOS>
The
evidence
is
very
strong
.
<EOS>
And
one
bad
symptom
is
that
she
denies
everything
 
denies
that
she
has
had
a
child
in
the
face
of
the
most
positive
evidence
.
<EOS>
I
saw
her
myself
,
and
she
was
obstinately
silent
to
me
;
she
shrank
up
like
a
frightened
animal
when
she
saw
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
never
so
shocked
in
my
life
as
at
the
change
in
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
trust
that
,
in
the
worst
case
,
we
may
obtain
a
pardon
for
the
sake
of
the
innocent
who
are
involved
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stuff
and
nonsense
!
"
said
Bartle
,
forgetting
in
his
irritation
to
whom
he
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
I
mean
it
's
stuff
and
nonsense
for
the
innocent
to
care
about
her
being
hanged
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
think
the
sooner
such
women
are
put
out
o
'
the
world
the
better
;
and
the
men
that
help
'em
to
do
mischief
had
better
go
along
with
'em
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
What
good
will
you
do
by
keeping
such
vermin
alive
,
eating
the
victual
that
'
ud
feed
rational
beings
?
<EOS>
But
if
Adam
's
fool
enough
to
care
about
it
,
I
do
n't
want
him
to
suffer
<EOS>
more
than
's
needful
....
<EOS>
Is
he
very
much
cut
up
,
poor
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
Bartle
added
,
taking
out
his
spectacles
and
putting
them
on
,
as
if
they
would
assist
his
imagination
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
'm
afraid
the
grief
cuts
very
deep
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
looks
terribly
shattered
,
and
a
certain
violence
came
over
him
now
and
then
yesterday
,
which
made
me
wish
I
could
have
remained
near
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
go
to
Stoniton
again
to
-
morrow
,
and
I
have
confidence
enough
in
the
strength
of
Adam
's
principle
to
trust
that
he
will
be
able
to
endure
the
worst
without
being
driven
to
anything
rash
.

Mr.
Irwine
,
who
was
involuntarily
uttering
his
own
thoughts
rather
than
addressing
Bartle
Massey
in
the
last
sentence
,
had
in
his
mind
the
possibility
that
the
spirit
of
vengeance
to

wards
Arthur
,
which
was
the
form
Adam
's
anguish
was
continually
taking
,
might
make
him
seek
an
encounter
that
was
likely
to
end
more
fatally
than
the
one
in
the
Grove
.
<EOS>
This
possibility
heightened
the
anxiety
with
which
he
looked
forward
to
Arthur
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
But
Bartle
thought
Mr.
Irwine
was
referring
to
suicide
,
and
his
face
wore
a
new
alarm
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
I
have
in
my
head
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
hope
you
'll
approve
of
it
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
shut
up
my
school
 
<EOS>
if
the
scholars
come
,
they
must
go
back
again
<EOS>
,
that
's
all
 
<EOS>
and
I
shall
go
to
Stoniton
and
look
after
Adam
till
this
business
is
over
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pretend
I
'm
come
to
look
on
at
the
assizes
;
he
ca
n't
object
to
that
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
about
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
rather
hesitatingly
,
"
there
would
be
some
real
advantages
in
that
...
<EOS>
and
I
honour
you
for
your
friendship
towards
him
,
Bartle
.
<EOS>
But
...
you
must
be
careful
what
you
say
to
him
,
you
know
.
<EOS>
I
'm
afraid
you
have
too
little
fellow
-
feeling
in
what
you
consider
his
weakness
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
to
me
,
sir
 
trust
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
fool
myself
in
my
time
,
but
that
's
between
you
and
me
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
thrust
myself
on
him
<EOS>
only
keep
my
eye
on
him
,
and
see
that
he
gets
some
good
food
,
and
put
in
a
word
here
and
there
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
reassured
a
little
as
to
Bartle
's
discretion
,
"
I
think
you
'll
be
doing
a
good
deed
;
and
it
will
be
well
for
you
to
let
Adam
's
mother
and
brother
know
that
you
're
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
yes
,
"
said
Bartle
,
rising
,
and
taking
off
his
spectacles
,
"
I
'll
do
that
<EOS>
,
I
'll
do
that
;
though
the
mother
's
a
whimpering
thing
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
like
to
come
within
earshot
of
her
;
however
,
she
's
a
straight
-
backed
,
clean
woman
,
none
of
your
slatterns
.
<EOS>
I
wish
you
good
-
bye
,
sir
,
and
thank
you
for
the
time
you
've
spared
me
.
<EOS>
You
're
everybody
's
friend
in
this
business
 
<EOS>
everybody
's
friend
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
heavy
weight
you
've
got
on
your
shoulders
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
Bartle
,
till
we
meet
at
Stoniton
,
as
I
daresay
we
shall
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bartle
hurried
away
from
the
rectory
,
evading
Carroll
's
conversational
advances
,
and
saying
in
an
exasperated
tone
to
Vixen
,
whose
short
legs
pattered
beside
him
on
the
gravel
,
"
Now
,
I
shall
be
obliged
to
take
you
with
me
,
you
good
-
for
-
nothing
woman
.
<EOS>
You
'd
go
fretting
yourself
to
death
if
I
left
you
 
<EOS>
you
know
you
would
,
and
perhaps
get
snapped
up
by
some
tramp
.
<EOS>
And
you
'll
be
running
into
bad
company
,
I
expect
,
putting
your
nose
in
every
hole
and
corner
where
you
've
no
business
!
<EOS>
But
if
you
do
anything
disgraceful
,
I
'll
disown
you
 
mind
<EOS>
that
,
madam
,
mind
that
!

The
Eve
of
the
Trial
  
<EOS>
AN
upper
room
in
a
dull
Stoniton
street
,
with
two
beds
in
it
 
one
laid
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
It
is
ten
o'clock
on
Thursday
night
,
and
the
dark
wall
opposite
the
window
shuts
out
the
moonlight
that
might
have
struggled
with
the
light
of
the
one
dip
candle
by
which
Bartle
Massey
is
pretending
to
read
,
while
he
is
really
looking
over
his
spectacles
at
Adam
Bede
,
seated
near
the
dark
window
.
  
<EOS>
You
would
hardly
have
known
it
was
Adam
without
being
told
.
<EOS>
His
face
has
got
thinner
this
last
week
:
he
has
the
sunken
eyes
,
the
neglected
beard
of
a
man
just
risen
from
a
sick
-
bed
.
<EOS>
His
heavy
black
hair
hangs
over
his
forehead
,
and
there
is
no
active
impulse
in
him
which
inclines
him
to
push
it
off
,
that
he
may
be
more
awake
to
what
is
around
him
.
<EOS>
He
has
one
arm
over
the
back
of
the
chair
,
and
he
seems
to
be
looking
down
at
his
clasped
hands
.
<EOS>
He
is
roused
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
he
is
,
"
said
Bartle
Massey
,
rising
hastily
and
unfastening
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
Mr.
Irwine
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
rose
from
his
chair
with
instinctive
respect
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
approached
him
and
took
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
late
,
Adam
,
"
he
said
,
sitting
down
on
the
chair
which
Bartle
placed
for
him
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
was
later
in
setting
off
from
Broxton
than
I
intended
to
be
,
and
I
have
been
incessantly
occupied
since
I
arrived
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
everything
now
,
however
 
everything
that
can
be
done
to
-
night
,
at
least
.
<EOS>
Let
us
all
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
took
his
chair
again
mechanically
,
and
Bartle
,
for
whom
there
was
no
chair
remaining
,
sat
on
the
bed
in
the
background
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
seen
her
,
sir
?
"
said
Adam
tremulously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Adam
;
I
and
the
chaplain
have
both
been
with
her
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Did
you
ask
her
,
sir
...
did
you
say
anything
about
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
with
some
hesitation
,
"
I
spoke
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
said
you
wished
to
see
her
before
the
trial
,
if
she
consented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Irwine
paused
,
Adam
looked
at
him
with
eager
,
questioning
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
she
shrinks
from
seeing
any
one
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
only
you
 
<EOS>
some
fatal
influence
seems
to
have
shut
up
her
heart
against
her
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
She
has
scarcely
said
anything
more
than
"
<EOS>
No
"
either
to
me
or
the
chaplain
.
<EOS>
Three
or
four
days
ago
,
before
you
were
mentioned
to
her
,
when
I
asked
her
if
there
was
any
one
of
her
family
whom
she
would
like
to
see
 
to
whom
she
could
open
her
mind
 
<EOS>
she
said
,
with
a
violent
shudder
,
"
Tell
them
not
to
come
near
me
 
I
wo
n't
see
any
of
them
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Adam
's
head
was
hanging
down
again
,
and
he
did
not
speak
.
<EOS>
There
was
silence
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
then
Mr.
Irwine
said
,
"
I
do
n't
like
to
advise
you
against
your
own
feelings
,
Adam
,
if
they
now
urge
you
strongly
to
go
and
see
her
to
-
morrow
morning
,
even
without
her
consent
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
possible
,
notwithstanding
appearances
to
the
contrary
,
that
the
interview
might
affect
her
favourably
.
<EOS>
But
I
grieve
to
say
I
have
scarcely
any
hope
of
that
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
seem
agitated
when
I
mentioned
your
name
;
she
only
said
"
No
,
"
in
the
same
cold
,
obstinate
way
as
usual
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
meeting
had
no
good
effect
on
her
,
it
would
be
pure
,
useless
suffering
to
you
 
<EOS>
severe
suffering
<EOS>
,
I
fear
.
<EOS>
She
is
very
much
changed
...
<EOS>
"
  
Adam
started
up
from
his
chair
and
seized
his
hat
,
which
lay
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
But
he
stood
still
then
,
and
looked
at
Mr.
Irwine
,
as
if
he
had
a
question
to
ask
which
it
was
yet
difficult
to
utter
.
<EOS>
Bartle
Massey
rose
quietly
,
turned
the
key
in
the
door
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
come
back
?
"
said
Adam
at
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
he
is
not
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lay
down
your
hat
,
Adam
,
unless
you
like
to
walk
out
with
me
for
a
little
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
I
fear
you
have
not
been
out
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
deceive
me
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
looking
hard
at
Mr.
Irwine
and
speaking
in
a
tone
of
angry
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
only
want
justice
.
<EOS>
I
want
him
to
feel
what
she
feels
.
<EOS>
It
's
his
work
...
<EOS>
she
was
a
child
as
it
'
ud
<EOS>
ha
'
gone
t
'
anybody
's
heart
to
look
at
...
I
do
n't
care
what
she
's
done
...
<EOS>
it
was
him
brought
her
to
it
.
<EOS>
And
he
shall
know
it
...
<EOS>
he
shall
feel
it
...
<EOS>
if
there
's
a
just
God
,
he
shall
feel
what
it
is
t
'
ha
'
brought
a
child
like
her
to
sin
and
misery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
deceiving
you
,
Adam
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
.
"
<EOS>
Arthur
Donnithorne
is
not
come
back
 
was
not
come
back
when
I
left
.
<EOS>
I
have
left
a
letter
for
him
:
he
will
know
all
as
soon
as
he
arrives
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
n't
mind
about
it
,
"
said
Adam
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
does
n't
matter
as
she
lies
there
in
shame
and
misery
,
and
he
knows
nothing
about
it
 
<EOS>
he
suffers
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
he
WILL
know
 
he
WILL
suffer
,
long
and
bitterly
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
heart
and
a
conscience
:
I
ca
n't
be
entirely
deceived
in
his
character
.
<EOS>
I
am
convinced
 
I
am
sure
he
did
n't
fall
under
temptation
without
a
struggle
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
weak
,
but
he
is
not
callous
,
not
coldly
selfish
.
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
that
this
will
be
a
shock
of
which
he
will
feel
the
effects
all
his
life
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
crave
vengeance
in
this
way
?
<EOS>
No
amount
of
torture
that
you
could
inflict
on
him
could
benefit
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
O
God
,
no
,
"
Adam
groaned
out
,
sinking
on
his
chair
again
;
"
but
then
,
that
's
the
deepest
curse
of
all
...
<EOS>
that
's
what
makes
the
blackness
of
it
...
<EOS>
IT
CAN
NEVER
BE
UNDONE
.
<EOS>
My
poor
Hetty
...
she
can
never
be
my
sweet
Hetty
again
...
<EOS>
the
prettiest
thing
God
had
made
 
smiling
up
at
me
...
<EOS>
I
thought
she
loved
me
...
and
was
good
...
<EOS>
"
  
Adam
's
voice
had
been
gradually
sinking
into
a
hoarse
undertone
,
as
if
he
were
only
talking
to
himself
;
but
now
he
said
abruptly
,
looking
at
Mr.
Irwine
,
"
<EOS>
But
she
is
n't
as
guilty
as
they
say
?
<EOS>
You
do
n't
think
she
is
,
sir
?
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
ha
'
done
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
perhaps
can
never
be
known
with
certainty
,
Adam
,
"
Mr.
Irwine
answered
gently
.
<EOS>
"
In
these
cases
we
sometimes
form
our
judgment
on
what
seems
to
us
strong
evidence
,
and
yet
,
for
want
of
knowing
some
small
fact
,
our
judgment
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
suppose
the
worst
:
you
have
no
right
to
say
that
the
guilt
of
her
crime
lies
with
him
,
and
that
he
ought
to
bear
the
punishment
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
for
us
men
to
apportion
the
shares
of
moral
guilt
and
retribution
.
<EOS>
We
find
it
impossible
to
avoid
mistakes
even
in
determining
who
has
committed
a
single
criminal
act
,
and
the
problem
how
far
a
man
is
to
be
held
responsible
for
the
unforeseen
consequences
of
his
own
deed
is
one
that
might
well
make
us
tremble
to
look
into
it
.
<EOS>
The
evil
consequences
that
may
lie
folded
in
a
single
act
of
selfish
indulgence
is
a
thought
so
awful
that
it
ought
surely
to
awaken
some
feeling
less
presumptuous
than
a
rash
desire
to
punish
.
<EOS>
You
have
a
mind
that
can
understand
this
fully
,
Adam
,
when
you
are
calm
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
suppose
I
ca
n't
enter
into
the
anguish
that
drives
you
into
this
state
of
revengeful
hatred
.
<EOS>
But
think
of
this
:
if
you
were
to
obey
your
passion
 
for
it
IS
passion
,
and
you
deceive
yourself
in
calling
it
justice
 
<EOS>
it
might
be
with
you
precisely
as
it
has
been
with
Arthur
;
nay
,
worse
;
your
passion
might
lead
you
yourself
into
a
horrible
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
not
worse
,
"
said
Adam
,
bitterly
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
it
's
worse
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
do
it
 
<EOS>
I
'd
sooner
do
a
wickedness
as
I
could
suffer
for
by
myself
than
ha
'
brought
HER
to
do
wickedness
and
then
stand
by
and
see
'em
punish
her
while
they
let
me
alone
;
and
all
for
a
bit
o
'
pleasure
,
as
,
if
he
'd
had
a
man
's
heart
in
him
,
he
'd
ha
'
cut
his
hand
off
sooner
than
he
'd
ha
'
taken
it
.
<EOS>
What
if
he
did
n't
foresee
what
's
happened
?
<EOS>
He
foresaw
enough
;
he
'd
no
right
to
expect
anything
but
harm
and
shame
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
then
he
wanted
to
smooth
it
off
wi
'
lies
.
<EOS>
No
 
there
's
<EOS>
plenty
o
'
<EOS>
things
folks
are
hanged
for
not
half
so
hateful
as
that
.
<EOS>
Let
a
man
do
what
he
will
,
if
he
knows
he
's
to
bear
the
punishment
himself
,
he
is
n't
half
so
bad
as
a
mean
selfish
coward
as
makes
things
easy
t
'
himself
and
knows
all
the
while
the
punishment
'll
fall
on
somebody
else

There
again
you
partly
deceive
yourself
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
sort
of
wrong
deed
of
which
a
man
can
bear
the
punishment
alone
;
you
ca
n't
isolate
yourself
and
say
that
the
evil
which
is
in
you
shall
not
spread
.
<EOS>
Men
's
lives
are
as
thoroughly
blended
with
each
other
as
the
air
they
breathe
:
<EOS>
evil
spreads
as
necessarily
as
disease
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
I
feel
the
terrible
extent
of
suffering
this
sin
of
Arthur
's
has
caused
to
others
;
but
so
does
every
sin
cause
suffering
to
others
besides
those
who
commit
it
.
<EOS>
An
act
of
vengeance
on
your
part
against
Arthur
would
simply
be
another
evil
added
to
those
we
are
suffering
under
:
you
could
not
bear
the
punishment
alone
;
you
would
entail
the
worst
sorrows
on
every
one
who
loves
you
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
committed
an
act
of
blind
fury
that
would
leave
all
the
present
evils
just
as
they
were
and
add
worse
evils
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
may
tell
me
that
you
meditate
no
fatal
act
of
vengeance
,
but
the
feeling
in
your
mind
is
what
gives
birth
to
such
actions
,
and
as
long
as
you
indulge
it
,
as
long
as
you
do
not
see
that
to
fix
your
mind
on
Arthur
's
punishment
is
revenge
,
and
not
justice
,
you
are
in
danger
of
being
led
on
to
the
commission
of
some
great
wrong
.
<EOS>
Remember
what
you
told
me
about
your
feelings
after
you
had
given
that
blow
to
Arthur
in
the
Grove
.

<EOS>
Adam
was
silent
:
the
last
words
had
called
up
a
vivid
image
of
the
past
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
left
him
to
his
thoughts
,
while
he
spoke
to
Bartle
Massey
about
old
Mr.
Donnithorne
's
funeral
and
other
matters
of
an
indifferent
kind
.
<EOS>
But
at
length
Adam
turned
round
and
said
,
in
a
more
subdued
tone
,
"
I
've
not
asked
about
'em
at
th
'
Hall
Farm
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Is
Mr.
Poyser
coming
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
come
;
he
is
in
Stoniton
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
advise
him
to
see
you
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
His
own
mind
is
in
a
very
perturbed
state
,
and
it
is
best
he
should
not
see
you
till
you
are
calmer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
Dinah
Morris
come
to
'em
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Seth
said
they
'd
sent
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
tells
me
she
was
not
come
when
he
left
.
<EOS>
They
're
afraid
the
letter
has
not
reached
her
.
<EOS>
It
seems
they
had
no
exact
address
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
sat
ruminating
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
"
I
wonder
if
Dinah
'
ud
ha
'
gone
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
Poysers
would
ha
'
been
sorely
against
it
,
since
they
wo
n't
come
nigh
her
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
I
think
she
would
,
for
the
Methodists
are
great
folks
for
going
into
the
prisons
;
and
Seth
said
he
thought
she
would
.
<EOS>
She
'd
a
very
tender
way
with
her
<EOS>
,
Dinah
had
;
I
wonder
if
she
could
ha
'
done
any
good
.
<EOS>
You
never
saw
her
,
sir
,
did
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
.
<EOS>
I
had
a
conversation
with
her
 
<EOS>
she
pleased
me
a
good
deal
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
mention
it
<EOS>
,
I
wish
she
would
come
,
for
it
is
possible
that
a
gentle
mild
woman
like
her
might
move
Hetty
to
open
her
heart
.
<EOS>
The
jail
chaplain
is
rather
harsh
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
o
'
<EOS>
no
use
if
she
does
n't
come
,
"
said
Adam
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
'd
thought
of
it
earlier
,
I
would
have
taken
some
measures
for
finding
her
out
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
,
"
but
<EOS>
it
's
too
late
now
,
I
fear
...
<EOS>
Well
,
Adam
,
I
must
go
now
.
<EOS>
Try
to
get
some
rest
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
see
you
early
to

morrow

<EOS>
The
Morning
of
the
Trial
  
<EOS>
AT
one
o'clock
the
next
day
,
Adam
was
alone
in
his
dull
upper
room
;
his
watch
lay
before
him
on
the
table
,
as
if
he
were
counting
the
long
minutes
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
knowledge
of
what
was
likely
to
be
said
by
the
witnesses
on
the
trial
,
for
he
had
shrunk
from
all
the
particulars
connected
with
Hetty
's
arrest
and
accusation
.
<EOS>
This
brave
active
man
,
who
would
have
hastened
towards
any
danger
or
toil
to
rescue
Hetty
from
an
apprehended
wrong
or
misfortune
,
felt
himself
powerless
to
contemplate
irremediable
evil
and
suffering
.
<EOS>
The
susceptibility
which
would
have
been
an
impelling
force
where
there
was
any
possibility
of
action
became
helpless
anguish
when
he
was
obliged
to
be
passive
,
or
else
sought
an
active
outlet
in
the
thought
of
inflicting
justice
on
Arthur
.
<EOS>
Energetic
natures
,
strong
for
all
strenuous
deeds
,
will
often
rush
away
from
a
hopeless
sufferer
,
as
if
they
were
hard
-
hearted
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
overmastering
sense
of
pain
that
drives
them
.
<EOS>
They
shrink
by
an
ungovernable
instinct
,
as
they
would
shrink
from
laceration
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
brought
himself
to
think
of
seeing
Hetty
,
if
she
would
consent
to
see
him
,
because
he
thought
the
meeting
might
possibly
be
a
good
to
her
 
might
help
to
melt
away
this
terrible
hardness
they
told
him
of
.
<EOS>
If
she
saw
he
bore
her
no
ill
will
for
what
she
had
done
to
him
,
she
might
open
her
heart
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
this
resolution
had
been
an
immense
effort
 
<EOS>
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
seeing
her
changed
face
,
as
a
timid
woman
trembles
at
the
thought
of
the
surgeon
's
knife
,
and
he
chose
now
to
bear
the
long
hours
of
suspense
rather
than
encounter
what
seemed
to
him
the
more
intolerable
agony
of
witnessing
her
trial
.
  
<EOS>
Deep
unspeakable
suffering
may
well
be
called
a
baptism
,
a
regeneration
,
the
initiation
into
a
new
state
.
<EOS>
The
yearning
memories
,
the
bitter
regret
,
the
agonized
sympathy
,
the
struggling
appeals
to
the
Invisible
<EOS>
Right
 
all
the
intense
emotions
which
had
filled
the
days
and
nights
of
the
past
week
,
and
were
compressing
themselves
again
like
an
eager
crowd
into
the
hours
of
this
single
morning
,
made
Adam
look
back
on
all
the
previous
years
as
if
they
had
been
a
dim
sleepy
existence
,
and
he
had
only
now
awaked
to
full
consciousness
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
him
as
if
he
had
always
before
thought
it
a
light
thing
that
men
should
suffer
,
as
if
all
that
he
had
himself
endured
and
called
sorrow
before
was
only
a
moment
's
stroke
that
had
never
left
a
bruise
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
a
great
anguish
may
do
the
work
of
years
,
and
we
may
come
out
from
that
baptism
of
fire
with
a
soul
full
of
new
awe
and
new
pity
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
God
,
"
Adam
groaned
,
as
he
leaned
on
the
table
and
looked
blankly
at
the
face
of
the
watch
,
"
and
men
have
suffered
like
this
before
...
and
poor
helpless
young
things
have
suffered
like
her
....
<EOS>
Such
a
little
while
ago
looking
so
happy
and
so
pretty
...
<EOS>
kissing
'em
all
,
her
grandfather
and
all
of
'em
,
and
they
wishing
her
luck
....
<EOS>
O
my
poor
,
poor
Hetty
...
<EOS>
dost
think
on
it
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
started
and
looked
round
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
Vixen
had
begun
to
whimper
,
and
there
was
a
sound
of
a
stick
and
a
lame
walk
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
Bartle
Massey
come
back
.
<EOS>
Could
it
be
all
over
?
  
<EOS>
Bartle
entered
quietly
,
and
,
going
up
to
Adam
,
grasped
his
hand
and
said
,
"
I
'm
just
come
to
look
at
you
,
my
boy
,
for
the
folks
are
gone
out
of
court
for
a
bit
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
's
heart
beat
so
violently
he
was
unable
to
speak
 
<EOS>
he
could
only
return
the
pressure
of
his
friend
's
hand
 
and
Bartle
,
drawing
up
the
other
chair
,
came
and
sat
in
front
of
him
,
taking
off
his
hat
and
his
spectacles
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
thing
never
happened
to
me
before
,
"
he
observed
,
"
to
go
out
o
'
the
door
with
my
spectacles
on
.
<EOS>
I
clean
forgot
to
take
'em
off
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
made
this
trivial
remark
,
thinking
it
better
not
to
respond
at
all
to
Adam
's
agitation
:
he
would
gather
,
in
an
indirect
way
,
that
there
was
nothing
decisive
to
communicate
at
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
"
he
said
,
rising
again
,
"
I
must
see
to
your
having
a
bit
of
the
loaf
,
and
some
of
that
wine
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
sent
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
angry
with
me
if
you
do
n't
have
it
.
<EOS>
Come
,
now
,
"
he
went
on
,
bringing
forward
the
bottle
and
the
loaf
and
pouring
some
wine
into
a
cup
,
"
I
must
have
a
bit
and
a
sup
myself
.
<EOS>
Drink
a
drop
with
me
,
my
lad
 
drink
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
pushed
the
cup
gently
away
and
said
,
entreatingly
,
"
Tell
me
about
it
,
Mr.
Massey
 
tell
me
all
about
it
.
<EOS>
Was
she
there
?
<EOS>
Have
they
begun
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
boy
,
yes
 
it
's
taken
all
the
time
since
I
first
went
;
but
they
're
slow
,
they
're
slow
;
and
there
's
the
counsel
they
've
got
for
her
puts
a
spoke
in
the
wheel
whenever
he
can
,
and
makes
a
deal
to
do
with
cross
-
examining
the
witnesses
and
quarrelling
with
the
other
lawyers
.
<EOS>
That
's
all
he
can
do
for
the
money
they
give
him
;
and
it
's
a
big
sum
 
<EOS>
it
's
a
big
sum
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
a
'
cute
fellow
,
with
an
eye
that
'
ud
pick
the
needles
out
of
the
hay
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
If
a
man
had
got
no
feelings
,
it
'
ud
be
as
good
as
a
demonstration
to
listen
to
what
goes
on
in
court
;
but
a
tender
heart
makes
one
stupid
.
<EOS>
I
'd
have
given
up
figures
for
ever
only
to
have
had
some
good
news
to
bring
to
you
,
my
poor
lad
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
does
it
seem
to
be
going
against
her
?
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
what
they
've
said
.
<EOS>
I
must
know
it
now
 
<EOS>
I
must
know
what
they
have
to
bring
against
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
the
chief
evidence
yet
has
been
the
doctors
;
all
but
Martin
Poyser
 
poor
Martin
.
<EOS>
Everybody
in
court
felt
for
him
 
<EOS>
it
was
like
one
sob
,
the
sound
they
made
when
he
came
down
again
.
<EOS>
The
worst
was
when
they
told
him
to
look
at
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
.
<EOS>
It
was
hard
work
,
poor
fellow
 
<EOS>
it
was
hard
work
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
my
boy
,
the
blow
falls
heavily
on
him
as
well
as
you
;
you
must
help
poor
Martin
;
you
must
show
courage
.
<EOS>
Drink
some
wine
now
,
and
show
me
you
mean
to
bear
it
like
a
man
.
"
  
<EOS>
Bartle
had
made
the
right
sort
of
appeal
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
with
an
air
of
quiet
obedience
,
took
up
the
cup
and
drank
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
how
SHE
looked
,
"
he
said
presently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Frightened
,
very
frightened
,
when
they
first
brought
her
in
;
it
was
the
first
sight
of
the
crowd
and
the
judge
,
poor
creatur
.
<EOS>
And
there
's
a
lot
o
'
foolish
women
in
fine
clothes
,
with
gewgaws
all
up
their
arms
and
feathers
on
their
heads
,
sitting
near
the
judge
:
they
've
dressed
themselves
out
in
that
way
,
one
'
ud
think
,
to
be
scarecrows
and
warnings
against
any
man
ever
meddling
with
a
woman
again
.
<EOS>
They
put
up
their
glasses
,
and
stared
and
whispered
.
<EOS>
But
after
that
she
stood
like
a
white
image
,
staring
down
at
her
hands
and
seeming
neither
to
hear
nor
see
anything
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
as
white
as
a
sheet
.
<EOS>
She
did
n't
speak
when
they
asked
her
if
she
'd
plead
"
guilty
"
or
"
not
guilty
,
"
and
they
pleaded
"
not
guilty
"
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
heard
her
uncle
's
name
,
there
seemed
to
go
a
shiver
right
through
her
;
and
when
they
told
him
to
look
at
her
,
she
hung
her
head
down
,
and
cowered
,
and
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
.
<EOS>
He
'd
much
ado
to
speak
poor
man
,
his
voice
trembled
so
.
<EOS>
And
the
counsellors
 
who
look
as
hard
as
nails
mostly
 
I
saw
,
spared
him
as
much
as
they
could
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
put
himself
near
him
and
went
with
him
out
o
'
court
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
it
's
a
great
thing
in
a
man
's
life
to
be
able
to
stand
by
a
neighbour
and
uphold
him
in
such
trouble
as
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
bless
him
,
and
you
too
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
,
in
a
low
voice
,
laying
his
hand
on
Bartle
's
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
he
's
good
metal
;
he
gives
the
right
ring
when
you
try
him
,
our
parson
does
.
<EOS>
A
man
o
'
sense
 
says
no
more
than
's
needful
.
<EOS>
He
's
not
one
of
those
that
think
they
can
comfort
you
with
chattering
,
as
if
folks
who
stand
by
and
look
on
knew
a
deal
better
what
the
trouble
was
than
those
who
have
to
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
to
do
with
such
folks
in
my
time
 
in
the
south
,
when
I
was
in
trouble
myself
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
is
to
be
a
witness
himself
,
by
and
by
,
on
her
side
,
you
know
,
to
speak
to
her
character
and
bringing
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
the
other
evidence
...
does
it
go
hard
against
her
!
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
,
Mr.
Massey
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
my
lad
,
yes
.
<EOS>
The
truth
is
the
best
thing
to
tell
.
<EOS>
It
must
come
at
last
.
<EOS>
The
doctors
'
evidence
is
heavy
on
her
 
is
heavy
.
<EOS>
But
she
's
gone
on
denying
she
's
had
a
child
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
These
poor
silly
women
-
things
 
<EOS>
they
've
not
the
sense
to
know
it
's
no
use
denying
what
's
proved
.
<EOS>
It
'll
make
against
her
with
the
jury
,
I
doubt
,
her
being
so
obstinate
:
they
may
be
less
for
recommending
her
to
mercy
,
if
the
verdict
's
against
her
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Irwine
'
ull
leave
no
stone
unturned
with
the
judge
 
<EOS>
you
may
rely
upon
that
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
there
nobody
to
stand
by
her
and
seem
to
care
for
her
in
the
court
?
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
chaplain
o
'
<EOS>
the
jail
sits
near
her
,
but
he
's
a
sharp
ferrety
-
faced
man
 
<EOS>
another
sort
<EOS>
o
'
flesh
and
blood
to
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
They
say
the
jail
chaplains
are
mostly
the
fag
-
end
o
'
the
clergy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
man
as
ought
to
be
there
,
"
said
Adam
bitterly
.
<EOS>
Presently
he
drew
himself
up
and
looked
fixedly
out
of
the
window
,
apparently
turning
over
some
new
idea
in
his
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Massey
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
pushing
the
hair
off
his
forehead
,
"
I
'll
go
back
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
into
court
.
<EOS>
It
's
cowardly
of
me
to
keep
away
.
<EOS>
I
'll
stand
by
her
 
<EOS>
I
'll
own
her
 
for
all
she
's
been
deceitful
.
<EOS>
They
ought
n't
to
cast
her
off
 
her
own
flesh
and
blood
.
<EOS>
We
hand
folks
over
to
God
's
mercy
,
and
show
none
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
be
hard
sometimes
:
I
'll
never
be
hard
again
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
,
Mr.
Massey
 
I
'll
go
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
decision
in
Adam
's
manner
which
would
have
prevented
Bartle
from
opposing
him
,
even
if
he
had
wished
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
only
said
,
"
Take
a
bit
,
then
,
and
another
sup
,
Adam
,
for
the
love
of
me
.
<EOS>
See
,
I
must
stop
and
eat
a
morsel
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
take
some
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nerved
by
an
active
resolution
,
Adam
took
a
morsel
of
bread
and
drank
some
wine
.
<EOS>
He
was
haggard
and
unshaven
,
as
he
had
been
yesterday
,
but
he
stood
upright
again
,
and
looked
more
like
the
Adam
Bede
of
former
days
.
    
<EOS>
The
Verdict
  
<EOS>
THE
place
fitted
up
that
day
as
a
court
of
justice
was
a
grand
old
hall
,
now
destroyed
by
fire
.
<EOS>
The
midday
light
that
fell
on
the
close
pavement
of
human
heads
was
shed
through
a
line
of
high
pointed
windows
,
variegated
with
the
mellow
tints
of
old
painted
glass
.
<EOS>
Grim
dusty
armour
hung
in
high
relief
in
front
of
the
dark
oaken
gallery
at
the
farther
end
,
and
under
the
broad
arch
of
the
great
mullioned
window
opposite
was
spread
a
curtain
of
old
tapestry
,
covered
with
dim
melancholy
figures
,
like
a
dozing
indistinct
dream
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
place
that
through
the
rest
of
the
year
was
haunted
with
the
shadowy
memories
of
old
kings
and
queens
,
unhappy
,
discrowned
,
imprisoned
;
but
to
-
day
all
those
shadows
had
fled
,
and
not
a
soul
in
the
vast
hall
<EOS>
felt
the
presence
of
any
but
a
living
sorrow
,
which
was
quivering
in
warm
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
But
that
sorrow
seemed
to
have
made
it
itself
feebly
felt
hitherto
,
now
when
Adam
Bede
's
tall
figure
was
suddenly
seen
being
ushered
to
the
side
of
the
prisoner
's
dock
.
<EOS>
In
the
broad
sunlight
of
the
great
hall
,
among
the
sleek
shaven
faces
of
other
men
,
the
marks
of
suffering
in
his
face
were
startling
even
to
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
had
last
seen
him
in
the
dim
light
of
his
small
room
;
and
the
neighbours
from
Hayslope
who
were
present
,
and
who
told
Hetty
Sorrel
's
story
by
their
firesides
in
their
old
age
,
never
forgot
to
say
how
it
moved
them
when
Adam
Bede
,
poor
fellow
,
taller
by
the
head
than
most
of
the
people
round
him
,
came
into
court
and
took
his
place
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
But
Hetty
did
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
in
the
same
position
Bartle
Massey
had
described
,
her
hands
crossed
over
each
other
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
them
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
not
dared
to
look
at
her
in
the
first
moments
,
but
at
last
,
when
the
attention
of
the
court
was
withdrawn
by
the
proceedings
he
turned
his
face
towards
her
with
a
resolution
not
to
shrink
.
  
<EOS>
Why
did
they
say
she
was
so
changed
?
<EOS>
In
the
corpse
we
love
,
it
is
the
likeness
we
see
 
<EOS>
it
is
the
likeness
,
which
makes
itself
felt
the
more
keenly
because
something
else
was
and
is
not
.
<EOS>
There
they
were
 
the
sweet
face
and
neck
,
with
the
dark
tendrils
of
hair
,
<EOS>
the
long
dark
lashes
,
the
rounded
cheek
and
the
pouting
lips
 
<EOS>
pale
and
thin
,
yes
,
but
like
Hetty
,
and
only
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Others
thought
she
looked
as
if
some
demon
had
cast
a
blighting
glance
upon
her
,
withered
up
the
woman
's
soul
in
her
,
and
left
only
a
hard
despairing
obstinacy
.
<EOS>
But
the
mother
's
yearning
,
that
completest
type
of
the
life
in
another
life
which
is
the
essence
of
real
human
love
,
feels
the
presence
of
the
cherished
child
even
in
the
debased
,
degraded
man
;
and
to
Adam
,
this
pale
,
hard
-
looking
culprit
was
the
Hetty
who
had
smiled
at
him
in
the
garden
under
the
apple
-
tree
boughs
 
<EOS>
she
was
that
Hetty
's
corpse
,
which
he
had
trembled
to
look
at
the
first
time
,
and
then
was
unwilling
to
turn
away
his
eyes
from
.
  
<EOS>
But
presently
he
heard
something
that
compelled
him
to
listen
,
and
made
the
sense
of
sight
less
absorbing
.
<EOS>
A
woman
was
in
the
witness
-
box
,
a
middle
-
aged
woman
,
who
spoke
in
a
firm
distinct
voice
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
"
My
name
is
Sarah
Stone
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
widow
,
and
keep
a
small
shop
licensed
to
sell
tobacco
,
snuff
,
and
tea
in
Church
Lane
,
Stoniton
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
at
the
bar
is
the
same
young
woman
who
came
,
looking
ill
and
tired
,
with
a
basket
on
her
arm
,
and
asked
for
a
lodging
at
my
house
on
Saturday
evening
,
the
27th
of
February
.
<EOS>
She
had
taken
the
house
for
a
public
,
because
there
was
a
figure
against
the
door
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
said
I
did
n't
take
in
lodgers
,
the
prisoner
began
to
cry
,
and
said
she
was
too
tired
to
go
anywhere
else
,
and
she
only
wanted
a
bed
for
one
night
.
<EOS>
And
her
prettiness
,
and
her
condition
,
and
something
respectable
about
her
clothes
and
looks
,
and
the
trouble
she
seemed
to
be
in
made
me
as
I
could
n't
find
in
my
heart
to
send
her
away
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
asked
her
to
sit
down
,
and
gave
her
some
tea
,
and
asked
her
where
she
was
going
,
and
where
her
friends
were
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
was
going
home
to
her
friends
:
they
were
farming
folks
a
good
way
off
,
and
she
'd
had
a
long
journey
that
had
cost
her
more
money
than
she
expected
,
so
as
she
'd
hardly
any
money
left
in
her
pocket
,
and
was
afraid
of
going
where
it
would
cost
her
much
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
obliged
to
sell
most
of
the
things
out
of
her
basket
,
but
she
'd
thankfully
give
a
shilling
for
a
bed
.
<EOS>
I
saw
no
reason
why
I
should
n't
take
the
young
woman
in
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
I
had
only
one
room
,
but
there
were
two
beds
in
it
,
and
I
told
her
she
might
stay
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
'd
been
led
wrong
,
and
got
into
trouble
,
but
if
she
was
going
to
her
friends
,
it
would
be
a
good
work
to
keep
her
out
of
further
harm
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
witness
then
stated
that
in
the
night
a
child
was
born
,
and
she
identified
the
baby
-
clothes
then
shown
to
her
as
those
in
which
she
had
herself
dressed
the
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Those
are
the
clothes
.
<EOS>
I
made
them
myself
,
and
had
kept
them
by
me
ever
since
my
last
child
was
born
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
deal
of
trouble
both
for
the
child
and
the
mother
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
help
taking
to
the
little
thing
and
being
anxious
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
send
for
a
doctor
,
for
there
seemed
no
need
.
<EOS>
I
told
the
mother
in
the
day
-
time
she
must
tell
me
the
name
of
her
friends
,
and
where
they
lived
,
and
let
me
write
to
them
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
by
and
by
she
would
write
herself
,
but
not
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
no
nay
,
but
she
would
get
up
and
be
dressed
,
in
spite
of
everything
I
could
say
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
felt
quite
strong
enough
;
and
it
was
wonderful
what
spirit
she
showed
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
n't
quite
easy
what
I
should
do
about
her
,
and
towards
evening
I
made
up
my
mind
<EOS>
I
'd
go
,
after
Meeting
was
over
,
and
speak
to
our
minister
about
it
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
house
about
half
-
past
eight
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
go
out
at
the
shop
door
,
but
at
the
back
door
,
which
opens
into
a
narrow
alley
.
<EOS>
I
've
only
got
the
ground
-
floor
of
the
house
,
and
the
kitchen
and
bedroom
both
look
into
the
alley
.
<EOS>
I
left
the
prisoner
sitting
up
by
the
fire
in
the
kitchen
with
the
baby
on
her
lap
.
<EOS>
She
had
n't
cried
or
seemed
low
at
all
,
as
she
did
the
night
before
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
had
a
strange
look
with
her
eyes
,
and
she
got
a
bit
flushed
towards
evening
.
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
of
the
fever
,
and
I
thought
I
'd
call
and
ask
an
acquaintance
of
mine
,
an
experienced
woman
,
to
come
back
with
me
when
I
went
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
dark
night
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
fasten
the
door
behind
me
;
there
was
no
lock
;
it
was
a
latch
with
a
bolt
inside
,
and
when
there
was
nobody
in
the
house
I
always
went
out
at
the
shop
door
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
there
was
no
danger
in
leaving
it
unfastened
that
little
while
.
<EOS>
I
was
longer
than
I
meant
to
be
,
for
I
had
to
wait
for
the
woman
that
came
back
with
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
hour
and
a
half
before
we
got
back
,
and
when
we
went
in
,
the
candle
was
standing
burning
just
as
I
left
it
,
but
the
prisoner
and
the
baby
were
both
gone
.
<EOS>
She
'd
taken
her
cloak
and
bonnet
,
but
she
'd
left
the
basket
and
the
things
in
it
....
<EOS>
I
was
dreadful
frightened
,
and
angry
with
her
for
going
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
go
to
give
information
,
because
I
'd
no
thought
she
meant
to
do
any
harm
,
and
I
knew
she
had
money
in
her
pocket
to
buy
her
food
and
lodging
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
like
to
set
the
constable
after
her
,
for
she
'd
a
right
to
go
from
me
if
she
liked
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
evidence
on
Adam
was
electrical
;
it
gave
him
new
force
.
<EOS>
Hetty
could
not
be
guilty
of
the
crime
 
<EOS>
her
heart
must
have
clung
to
her
baby
 
else
why
should
she
have
taken
it
with
her
?
<EOS>
She
might
have
left
it
behind
.
<EOS>
The
little
creature
had
died
naturally
,
and
then
she
had
hidden
it
.
<EOS>
Babies
were
so
liable
to
death
 
<EOS>
and
there
might
be
the
strongest
suspicions
without
any
proof
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
so
occupied
with
imaginary
arguments
against
such
suspicions
,
that
he
could
not
listen
to
the
cross
-
examination
by
Hetty
's
counsel
,
who
tried
,
without
result
,
to
elicit
evidence
that
the
prisoner
had
shown
some
movements
of
maternal
affection
towards
the
child
.
<EOS>
The
whole
time
this
witness
was
being
examined
,
Hetty
had
stood
as
motionless
as
before
:
no
word
seemed
to
arrest
her
ear
.
<EOS>
But
the
sound
of
the
next
witness
's
voice
touched
a
chord
that
was
still
sensitive
,
she
gave
a
start
and
a
frightened
look
towards
him
,
but
immediately
turned
away
her
head
and
looked
down
at
her
hands
as
before
.
<EOS>
This
witness
was
a
man
,
a
rough
peasant
.
<EOS>
He
said
:
  
"
My
name
is
John
Olding
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
labourer
,
and
live
at
Tedd
's
Hole
,
two
miles
out
of
Stoniton
.
<EOS>
A
week
last
Monday
,
towards
one
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
I
was
going
towards
Hetton
Coppice
,
and
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
coppice
I
saw
the
prisoner
,
in
a
red
cloak
,
sitting
under
a
bit
of
a
haystack
not
far
off
the
stile
.
<EOS>
She
got
up
when
she
saw
me
,
and
seemed
as
if
she
'd
be
walking
on
the
other
way
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
regular
road
through
the
fields
,
and
nothing
very
uncommon
to
see
a
young
woman
there
,
but
I
took
notice
of
her
because
she
looked
white
and
scared
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
she
was
a
beggar
-
woman
,
only
for
her
good
clothes
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
looked
a
bit
crazy
,
but
it
was
no
business
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
stood
and
looked
back
after
her
,
but
she
went
right
on
while
she
was
in
sight
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
go
to
the
other
side
of
the
coppice
to
look
after
some
stakes
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
road
right
through
it
,
and
bits
of
openings
here
and
there
,
where
the
trees
have
been
cut
down
,
and
some
of
'em
not
carried
away
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
go
straight
along
the
road
,
but
turned
off
towards
the
middle
,
and
took
a
shorter
way
towards
the
spot
I
wanted
to
get
to
.
<EOS>
I
had
n't
got
far
out
of
the
road
into
one
of
the
open
places
before
I
heard
a
strange
cry
.
<EOS>
I
thought
it
did
n't
come
from
any
animal
I
knew
,
but
I
was
n't
for
stopping
to
look
about
just
then
.
<EOS>
But
it
went
on
,
and
seemed
so
strange
to
me
in
that
place
,
I
could
n't
help
stopping
to
look
.
<EOS>
I
began
to
think
I
might
make
some
money
of
it
,
if
it
was
a
new
thing
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
hard
work
to
tell
which
way
it
came
from
,
and
for
a
good
while
I
kept
looking
up
at
the
boughs
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
thought
it
came
from
the
ground
;
and
there
was
a
lot
of
timber
-
choppings
lying
about
,
and
loose
pieces
of
turf
,
and
a
trunk
or
two
.
<EOS>
And
I
looked
about
among
them
,
but
could
find
nothing
,
and
at
last
the
cry
stopped
.
<EOS>
So
I
was
for
giving
it
up
,
and
I
went
on
about
my
business
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
came
back
the
same
way
pretty
nigh
an
hour
after
,
I
could
n't
help
laying
down
my
stakes
to
have
another
look
.
<EOS>
And
just
as
I
was
stooping
and
laying
down
the
stakes
,
I
saw
something
odd
and
round
and
whitish
lying
on
the
ground
under
a
nut
-
bush
by
the
side
of
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
stooped
down
on
hands
and
knees
to
pick
it
up
.
<EOS>
And
I
saw
it
was
a
little
baby
's
hand
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
these
words
a
thrill
ran
through
the
court
.
<EOS>
Hetty
was
visibly
trembling
;
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
she
seemed
to
be
listening
to
what
a
witness
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
lot
of
timber
-
choppings
put
together
just
where
the
ground
went
hollow
,
like
,
under
the
bush
,
and
the
hand
came
out
from
among
them
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
hole
left
in
one
place
<EOS>
and
I
could
see
down
it
and
see
the
child
's
head
;
and
I
made
haste
and
did
away
the
turf
and
the
choppings
,
and
took
out
the
child
.
<EOS>
It
had
got
comfortable
clothes
on
,
but
its
body
was
cold
,
and
I
thought
it
must
be
dead
.
<EOS>
I
made
haste
back
with
it
out
of
the
wood
,
and
took
it
home
to
my
wife
.
<EOS>
She
said
it
was
dead
,
and
I
'd
better
take
it
to
the
parish
and
tell
the
constable
.
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
"
I
'll
lay
my
life
<EOS>
it
's
that
young
woman
's
child
as
I
met
going
to
the
coppice
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
seemed
to
be
gone
clean
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
And
I
took
the
child
on
to
Hetton
parish
and
told
the
constable
,
and
we
went
on
to
Justice
Hardy
.
<EOS>
And
then
we
went
looking
after
the
young
woman
till
dark
at
night
,
and
we
went
and
gave
information
at
Stoniton
,
as
they
might
stop
her
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
morning
,
another
constable
came
to
me
,
to
go
with
him
to
the
spot
where
I
found
the
child
.
<EOS>
And
when
we
got
there
,
there
was
the
prisoner
a
-
sitting
against
the
bush
where
I
found
the
child
;
and
she
cried
out
when
she
saw
us
,
but
she
never
offered
to
move
.
<EOS>
She
'd
got
a
big
piece
of
bread
on
her
lap
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
given
a
faint
groan
of
despair
while
this
witness
was
speaking
.
<EOS>
He
had
hidden
his
face
on
his
arm
,
which
rested
on
the
boarding
in
front
of
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
supreme
moment
of
his
suffering
:
<EOS>
Hetty
was
guilty
;
and
he
was
silently
calling
to
God
for
help
.
<EOS>
He
heard
no
more
of
the
evidence
,
and
was
unconscious
when
the
case
for
the
prosecution
had
closed
 
unconscious
that
Mr.
Irwine
was
in
the
witness
-
box
,
telling
of
Hetty
's
unblemished
character
in
her
own
parish
and
of
the
virtuous
habits
in
which
she
had
been
brought
up
.
<EOS>
This
testimony
could
have
no
influence
on
the
verdict
,
but
it
was
given
as
part
of
that
plea
for
mercy
which
her
own
counsel
would
have
made
if
he
had
been
allowed
to
speak
for
her
 
a
favour
not
granted
to
criminals
in
those
stern
times
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Adam
lifted
up
his
head
,
for
there
was
a
general
movement
round
him
.
<EOS>
The
judge
had
addressed
the
jury
,
and
they
were
retiring
.
<EOS>
The
decisive
moment
was
not
far
off
Adam
<EOS>
felt
a
shuddering
horror
that
would
not
let
him
look
at
Hetty
,
but
she
had
long
relapsed
into
her
blank
hard
indifference
.
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
strained
to
look
at
her
,
but
she
stood
like
a
statue
of
dull
despair
.
  
<EOS>
'
There
was
a
mingled
rustling
,
whispering
,
and
low
buzzing
throughout
the
court
during
this
interval
.
<EOS>
The
desire
to
listen
was
suspended
,
and
every
one
had
some
feeling
or
opinion
to
express
in
undertones
.
<EOS>
Adam
sat
looking
blankly
before
him
,
but
he
did
not
see
the
objects
that
were
right
in
front
of
his
eyes
 
<EOS>
the
counsel
and
attorneys
talking
with
an
air
of
cool
business
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
in
low
earnest
conversation
with
the
judge
 
did
not
see
Mr.
Irwine
sit
down
again
in
agitation
and
shake
his
head
mournfully
when
somebody
whispered
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
inward
action
was
too
intense
for
Adam
to
take
in
outward
objects
until
some
strong
sensation
roused
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
very
long
,
hardly
more
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
before
the
knock
which
told
that
the
jury
had
come
to
their
decision
fell
as
a
signal
for
silence
on
every
ear
.
<EOS>
It
is
sublime
 
that
sudden
pause
of
a
great
multitude
which
tells
that
one
soul
moves
in
them
all
.
<EOS>
Deeper
and
deeper
the
silence
seemed
to
become
,
like
the
deepening
night
,
while
the
jurymen
's
names
were
called
over
,
and
the
prisoner
was
made
to
hold
up
her
hand
,
and
the
jury
were
asked
for
their
verdict
.
  
<EOS>
"
Guilty
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
verdict
every
one
expected
,
but
there
was
a
sigh
of
disappointment
from
some
hearts
that
it
was
followed
by
no
recommendation
to
mercy
.
<EOS>
Still
the
sympathy
of
the
court
was
not
with
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
unnaturalness
of
her
crime
stood
out
the
more
harshly
by
the
side
of
her
hard
immovability
and
obstinate
silence
.
<EOS>
Even
the
verdict
,
to
distant
eyes
,
had
not
appeared
to
move
her
,
but
those
who
were
near
saw
her
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
The
stillness
was
less
intense
until
the
judge
put
on
his
black
cap
,
and
the
chaplain
in
his
canonicals
was
observed
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Then
it
deepened
again
,
before
the
crier
had
had
time
to
command
silence
.
<EOS>
If
any
sound
were
heard
,
it
must
have
been
the
sound
of
beating
hearts
.
<EOS>
The
judge
spoke
,
"
Hester
Sorrel
....
"
  
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
Hetty
's
face
,
and
then
fled
back
again
as
she
looked
up
at
the
judge
and
kept
her
wide
-
open
eyes
fixed
on
him
,
as
if
fascinated
by
fear
.
<EOS>
Adam
had
not
yet
turned
towards
her
,
there
was
a
deep
horror
,
like
a
great
gulf
,
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
words
"
and
then
to
be
hanged
by
the
neck
till
you
be
dead
,
"
a
piercing
shriek
rang
through
the
hall
.
<EOS>
It
was
Hetty
's
shriek
.
<EOS>
Adam
started
to
his
feet
and
stretched
out
his
arms
towards
her
.
<EOS>
But
the
arms
could
not
reach
her
:
she
had
fallen
down
in
a
fainting
-
fit
,
and
was
carried
out
of
court
.
   
<EOS>
Arthur
's
Return
 
<EOS>
When
Arthur
Donnithorne
landed
at
Liverpool
and
read
the
letter
from
his
Aunt
Lydia
,
briefly
announcing
his
grand
-
father
's
death
,
his
first
feeling
was
,
"
Poor
Grandfather
!
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
have
got
to
him
to
be
with
him
when
he
died
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
felt
or
wished
something
at
the
last
that
I
shall
never
know
now
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lonely
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
that
his
grief
was
deeper
than
that
.
<EOS>
Pity
and
softened
memory
took
place
of
the
old
antagonism
,
and
in
his
busy
thoughts
about
the
future
,
as
the
chaise
carried
him
rapidly
along
towards
the
home
where
he
was
now
to
be
master
,
there
was
a
continually
recurring
effort
to
remember
anything
by
which
he
could
show
a
regard
for
his
grandfather
's
wishes
,
without
counteracting
his
own
cherished
aims
for
the
good
of
the
tenants
and
the
estate
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
in
human
nature
 
only
in
human
pretence
 
for
a
young
man
like
Arthur
,
with
a
fine
constitution
and
fine
spirits
,
thinking
well
of
himself
,
believing
that
others
think
well
of
him
,
and
having
a
very
ardent
intention
to
give
them
more
and
more
reason
for
that
good
opinion
 
it
is
not
possible
for
such
a
young
man
,
just
coming
into
a
splendid
estate
through
the
death
of
a
very
old
man
whom
he
was
not
fond
of
,
to
feel
anything
very
different
from
exultant
joy
.
<EOS>
Now
his
real
life
was
beginning
;
now
he
would
have
room
and
opportunity
for
action
,
and
he
would
use
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
show
the
Loamshire
people
what
a
fine
country
gentleman
was
;
he
would
not
exchange
that
career
for
any
other
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
He
felt
himself
riding
over
the
hills
in
the
breezy
autumn
days
,
looking
after
favourite
plans
of
drainage
and
enclosure
;
then
admired
on
sombre
mornings
as
the
best
rider
on
the
best
horse
in
the
hunt
;
spoken
well
of
on
market
-
days
as
a
first
-
rate
landlord
;
by
and
by
making
speeches
at
election
dinners
,
and
showing
a
wonderful
knowledge
of
agriculture
;
the
patron
of
new
ploughs
and
drills
,
the
severe
upbraider
of
negligent
landowners
,
and
withal
a
jolly
fellow
that
everybody
must
like
 
happy
faces
greeting
him
everywhere
on
his
own
estate
,
and
the
neighbouring
families
on
the
best
terms
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
Irwines
should
dine
with
him
every
week
,
and
have
their
own
carriage
to
come
in
,
for
in
some
very
delicate
way
that
Arthur
would
devise
,
the
lay
-
impropriator
of
the
Hayslope
tithes
would
insist
on
paying
a
couple
of
hundreds
more
to
the
vicar
;
and
his
aunt
should
be
as
comfortable
as
possible
,
and
go
on
living
at
the
Chase
,
if
she
liked
,
in
spite
of
her
old
-
maidish
ways
 
at
least
until
he
was
married
,
and
that
event
lay
in
the
indistinct
background
,
for
Arthur
had
not
yet
seen
the
woman
who
would
play
the
lady
-
wife
to
the
first
-
rate
country
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
Arthur
's
chief
thoughts
,
so
far
as
a
man
's
thoughts
through
hours
of
travelling
can
be
compressed
into
a
few
sentences
,
which
are
only
like
the
list
of
names
telling
you
what
are
the
scenes
in
a
long
long
panorama
full
of
colour
,
of
detail
,
and
of
life
.
<EOS>
The
happy
faces
Arthur
saw
greeting
him
were
not
pale
abstractions
,
but
real
ruddy
faces
,
long
familiar
to
him
:
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
was
there
 
the
whole
Poyser
family
.
  
<EOS>
What
 
<EOS>
Hetty
?
  
<EOS>
Yes
;
for
Arthur
was
at
ease
about
Hetty
 
not
quite
at
ease
about
the
past
,
for
a
certain
burning
of
the
ears
<EOS>
would
come
whenever
he
thought
of
the
scenes
with
Adam
last
August
,
but
at
ease
about
her
present
lot
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
,
who
had
been
a
regular
correspondent
,
telling
him
all
the
news
about
the
old
places
and
people
,
had
sent
him
word
nearly
three
months
ago
that
Adam
Bede
was
not
to
marry
Mary
Burge
,
as
he
had
thought
,
but
pretty
Hetty
Sorrel
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
and
Adam
himself
had
both
told
Mr.
Irwine
all
about
it
 
that
Adam
had
been
deeply
in
love
with
Hetty
these
two
years
,
and
that
now
it
was
agreed
they
were
to
be
married
in
March
.
<EOS>
That
stalwart
rogue
Adam
was
more
susceptible
than
the
rector
had
thought
;
it
was
really
quite
an
idyllic
love
affair
;
and
if
it
had
not
been
too
long
to
tell
in
a
letter
,
he
would
have
liked
to
describe
to
Arthur
the
blushing
looks
and
the
simple
strong
words
with
which
the
fine
honest
fellow
told
his
secret
.
<EOS>
He
knew
Arthur
would
like
to
hear
that
Adam
had
this
sort
of
happiness
in
prospect
.
  
<EOS>
Yes
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
there
was
not
air
enough
in
the
room
to
satisfy
his
renovated
life
,
when
he
had
read
that
passage
in
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
threw
up
the
windows
,
he
rushed
out
of
doors
into
the
December
air
,
and
greeted
every
one
who
spoke
to
him
with
an
eager
gaiety
,
as
if
there
had
been
news
of
a
fresh
Nelson
victory
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
that
day
since
he
had
come
to
Windsor
,
he
was
in
true
boyish
spirits
.
<EOS>
The
load
that
had
been
pressing
upon
him
was
gone
,
the
haunting
fear
had
vanished
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
could
conquer
his
bitterness
towards
Adam
now
 
could
offer
him
his
hand
,
and
ask
to
be
his
friend
again
,
in
spite
of
that
painful
memory
which
would
still
make
his
ears
burn
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
knocked
down
,
and
he
had
been
forced
to
tell
a
lie
:
such
things
make
a
scar
,
do
what
we
will
.
<EOS>
But
if
Adam
were
the
same
again
as
in
the
old
days
,
Arthur
wished
to
be
the
same
too
,
and
to
have
Adam
mixed
up
with
his
business
and
his
future
,
as
he
had
always
desired
before
the
accursed
meeting
in
August
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
would
do
a
great
deal
more
for
Adam
than
he
should
otherwise
have
done
,
when
he
came
into
the
estate
;
Hetty
's
husband
had
a
special
claim
on
him
 
<EOS>
Hetty
herself
should
feel
that
any
pain
she
had
suffered
through
Arthur
in
the
past
was
compensated
to
her
a
hundredfold
.
<EOS>
For
really
she
could
not
have
felt
much
,
since
she
had
so
soon
made
up
her
mind
to
marry
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
You
perceive
clearly
what
sort
of
picture
Adam
and
Hetty
made
in
the
panorama
of
Arthur
's
thoughts
on
his
journey
homeward
.
<EOS>
It
was
March
now
;
they
were
soon
to
be
married
:
perhaps
they
were
already
married
.
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
actually
in
his
power
to
do
a
great
deal
for
them
.
<EOS>
Sweet
 
sweet
little
Hetty
!
<EOS>
The
little
puss
had
n't
cared
for
him
half
as
much
as
he
cared
for
her
;
for
he
was
a
great
fool
about
her
<EOS>
still
 
was
almost
afraid
of
seeing
her
 
indeed
,
had
not
cared
much
to
look
at
any
other
woman
since
he
parted
from
her
.
<EOS>
That
little
figure
coming
towards
him
in
the
Grove
,
those
dark
-
fringed
childish
eyes
,
the
lovely
lips
put
up
to
kiss
him
 
that
picture
had
got
no
fainter
with
the
lapse
of
months
.
<EOS>
And
she
would
look
just
the
same
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
think
how
he
could
meet
her
:
he
should
certainly
tremble
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
how
long
this
sort
of
influence
lasts
,
for
he
was
certainly
not
in
love
with
Hetty
now
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
earnestly
desiring
,
for
months
,
that
she
should
marry
Adam
,
and
there
was
nothing
that
contributed
more
to
his
happiness
in
these
moments
than
the
thought
of
their
marriage
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
exaggerating
effect
of
imagination
that
made
his
heart
still
beat
a
little
more
quickly
at
the
thought
of
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
saw
the
little
thing
again
as
she
really
was
,
as
Adam
's
wife
,
at
work
quite
prosaically
in
her
new
home
,
he
should
perhaps
wonder
at
the
possibility
of
his
past
feelings
.
<EOS>
Thank
heaven
it
had
turned
out
so
well
!
<EOS>
He
should
have
plenty
of
affairs
and
interests
to
fill
his
life
now
,
and
not
be
in
danger
of
playing
the
fool
again
.
  
<EOS>
Pleasant
<EOS>
the
crack
of
the
post
-
boy
's
whip
!
<EOS>
Pleasant
the
sense
of
being
hurried
along
in
swift
ease
through
English
scenes
,
so
like
those
round
his
own
home
,
only
not
quite
so
charming
.
<EOS>
Here
was
a
market
-
town
 
very
much
like
Treddleston
 
where
the
arms
of
the
neighbouring
lord
of
the
manor
were
borne
on
the
sign
of
the
principal
inn
;
then
mere
fields
and
hedges
,
their
vicinity
to
a
market
-
town
carrying
an
agreeable
suggestion
of
high
rent
,
till
the
land
began
to
assume
a
trimmer
look
,
the
woods
were
more
frequent
,
and
at
length
a
white
or
red
mansion
looked
down
from
a
moderate
eminence
,
or
allowed
him
to
be
aware
of
its
parapet
and
chimneys
among
the
dense
-
looking
masses
of
oaks
and
elms
 
<EOS>
masses
reddened
now
with
early
buds
.
<EOS>
And
close
at
hand
came
the
village
:
the
small
church
,
with
its
red
-
tiled
roof
,
looking
humble
even
among
the
faded
half
-
timbered
houses
;
the
old
green
gravestones
with
nettles
round
them
;
nothing
fresh
and
bright
but
the
children
,
opening
round
eyes
at
the
swift
post
-
chaise
;
nothing
noisy
and
busy
but
the
gaping
curs
of
mysterious
pedigree
.
<EOS>
What
a
much
prettier
village
Hayslope
was
!
<EOS>
And
it
should
not
be
neglected
like
this
place
:
vigorous
repairs
should
go
on
everywhere
among
farm
-
buildings
and
cottages
,
and
travellers
in
post
-
chaises
,
coming
along
the
Rosseter
road
,
should
do
nothing
but
admire
as
they
went
.
<EOS>
And
Adam
Bede
should
superintend
all
the
repairs
,
for
he
had
a
share
in
Burge
's
business
now
,
and
,
if
he
liked
,
Arthur
would
put
some
money
into
the
concern
and
buy
the
old
man
out
in
another
year
or
two
.
<EOS>
That
was
an
ugly
fault
in
Arthur
's
life
,
that
affair
last
summer
,
but
the
future
should
make
amends
.
<EOS>
Many
men
would
have
retained
a
feeling
of
vindictiveness
towards
Adam
,
but
he
would
not
 
he
would
resolutely
overcome
all
littleness
of
that
kind
,
for
he
had
certainly
been
very
much
in
the
wrong
;
and
though
Adam
had
been
harsh
and
violent
,
and
had
thrust
on
him
a
painful
dilemma
,
the
poor
fellow
was
in
love
,
and
had
real
provocation
.
<EOS>
No
,
Arthur
had
not
an
evil
feeling
in
his
mind
towards
any
human
being
:
he
was
happy
,
and
would
make
every
one
else
happy
that
came
within
his
reach
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
was
dear
old
Hayslope
at
last
,
sleeping
,
on
the
hill
,
like
a
quiet
old
place
as
it
was
,
in
the
late
afternoon
sunlight
,
and
opposite
to
it
the
great
shoulders
of
the
Binton
Hills
,
below
them
the
purplish
blackness
of
the
hanging
woods
,
and
at
last
the
pale
front
of
the
Abbey
,
looking
out
from
among
the
oaks
of
the
Chase
,
as
if
anxious
for
the
heir
's
return
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Grandfather
!
<EOS>
And
he
lies
dead
there
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
fellow
once
,
coming
into
the
estate
and
making
his
plans
.
<EOS>
So
the
world
goes
round
!
<EOS>
Aunt
Lydia
must
feel
very
desolate
,
poor
thing
;
but
she
shall
be
indulged
as
much
as
she
indulges
her
fat
Fido
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
wheels
of
Arthur
's
chaise
had
been
anxiously
listened
for
at
the
Chase
,
for
to
-
day
was
Friday
,
and
the
funeral
had
already
been
deferred
two
days
.
<EOS>
Before
it
drew
up
on
the
gravel
of
the
courtyard
,
all
the
servants
in
the
house
were
assembled
to
receive
him
with
a
grave
,
decent
welcome
,
befitting
a
house
of
death
.
<EOS>
A
month
ago
,
perhaps
,
it
would
have
been
difficult
for
them
to
have
maintained
a
suitable
sadness
in
their
faces
,
when
Mr.
Arthur
was
come
to
take
possession
;
but
the
hearts
of
the
head
-
servants
were
heavy
that
day
for
another
cause
than
the
death
of
the
old
squire
,
and
more
than
one
of
them
was
longing
to
be
twenty
miles
away
,
as
Mr.
Craig
was
,
knowing
what
was
to
become
of
Hetty
Sorrel
 
pretty
Hetty
Sorrel
 
whom
they
used
to
see
every
week
.
<EOS>
They
had
the
partisanship
of
household
servants
who
like
their
places
,
and
were
not
inclined
to
go
the
full
length
of
the
severe
indignation
felt
against
him
by
the
farming
tenants
,
but
rather
to
make
excuses
for
him
;
nevertheless
,
the
upper
servants
,
who
had
been
on
terms
of
neighbourly
intercourse
with
the
Poysers
for
many
years
,
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
longed
-
for
event
of
the
young
squire
's
coming
into
the
estate
had
been
robbed
of
all
its
pleasantness
.
  
<EOS>
To
Arthur
it
was
nothing
surprising
that
the
servants
looked
grave
and
sad
:
he
himself
was
very
much
touched
on
seeing
them
all
again
,
and
feeling
that
he
was
in
a
new
relation
to
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
sort
of
pathetic
emotion
which
has
more
pleasure
than
pain
in
it
 
which
is
perhaps
one
of
the
most
delicious
of
all
states
to
a
good
-
natured
man
,
conscious
of
the
power
to
satisfy
his
good
nature
.
<EOS>
His
heart
swelled
agreeably
as
he
said
,
"
Well
,
Mills
,
how
is
my
aunt
?
"
  
<EOS>
But
now
Mr.
Bygate
,
the
lawyer
,
who
had
been
in
the
house
ever
since
the
death
,
came
forward
to
give
deferential
greetings
and
answer
all
questions
,
and
Arthur
walked
with
him
towards
the
library
,
where
his
Aunt
Lydia
was
expecting
him
.
<EOS>
Aunt
Lydia
was
the
only
person
in
the
house
who
knew
nothing
about
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Her
sorrow
as
a
maiden
daughter
was
unmixed
with
any
other
thoughts
than
those
of
anxiety
about
funeral
arrangements
and
her
own
future
lot
;
and
,
after
the
manner
of
women
,
she
mourned
for
the
father
who
had
made
her
life
important
,
all
the
more
because
she
had
a
secret
sense
that
there
was
little
mourning
for
him
in
other
hearts
.
  
<EOS>
But
Arthur
kissed
her
tearful
face
more
tenderly
than
he
had
ever
done
in
his
life
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Aunt
,
"
he
said
affectionately
,
as
he
held
her
hand
,
"
YOUR
loss
is
the
greatest
of
all
,
but
you
must
tell
me
how
to
try
and
make
it
up
to
you
all
the
rest
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
so
sudden
and
so
dreadful
,
Arthur
,
"
poor
Miss
Lydia
began
,
pouring
out
her
little
plaints
,
and
Arthur
sat
down
to
listen
with
impatient
patience
.
<EOS>
When
a
pause
came
,
he
said
:
  
"
Now
,
Aunt
,
I
'll
leave
you
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
just
to
go
to
my
own
room
,
and
then
I
shall
come
and
give
full
attention
to
everything
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
room
is
all
ready
for
me
,
I
suppose
,
Mills
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
to
the
butler
,
who
seemed
to
be
lingering
uneasily
about
the
entrance
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
and
there
are
letters
for
you
;
they
are
all
laid
on
the
writing
-
table
in
your
dressing
-
room
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
entering
the
small
anteroom
which
was
called
a
dressing
-
room
,
but
which
Arthur
really
used
only
to
lounge
and
write
in
,
he
just
cast
his
eyes
on
the
writing
-
table
,
and
saw
that
there
were
several
letters
and
packets
lying
there
;
but
he
was
in
the
uncomfortable
dusty
condition
of
a
man
who
has
had
a
long
hurried
journey
,
and
he
must
really
refresh
himself
by
attending
to
his
toilette
a
little
,
before
he
read
his
letters
.
<EOS>
Pym
was
there
,
making
everything
ready
for
him
,
and
soon
,
with
a
delightful
freshness
about
him
,
as
if
he
were
prepared
to
begin
a
new
day
,
he
went
back
into
his
dressing
-
room
to
open
his
letters
.
<EOS>
The
level
rays
of
the
low
afternoon
sun
entered
directly
at
the
window
,
and
as
Arthur
seated
himself
in
his
velvet
chair
with
their
pleasant
warmth
upon
him
,
he
was
conscious
of
that
quiet
well
-
being
which
perhaps
you
and
I
have
felt
on
a
sunny
afternoon
when
,
in
our
brightest
youth
and
health
,
life
has
opened
a
new
vista
for
us
,
and
long
to
-
morrows
of
activity
have
stretched
before
us
like
a
lovely
plain
which
there
was
no
need
for
hurrying
to
look
at
,
because
it
was
all
our
own
.
  
<EOS>
The
top
letter
was
placed
with
its
address
upwards
:
it
was
in
Mr.
Irwine
's
handwriting
,
Arthur
saw
at
once
;
and
below
the
address
was
written
,
"
To
be
delivered
as
soon
as
he
arrives
.
<EOS>
"
Nothing
could
have
been
less
surprising
to
him
than
a
letter
from
Mr.
Irwine
at
that
moment
:
of
course
,
there
was
something
he
wished
Arthur
to
know
earlier
than
it
was
possible
for
them
to
see
each
other
.
<EOS>
At
such
a
time
as
that
it
was
quite
natural
that
Irwine
should
have
something
pressing
to
say
.
<EOS>
Arthur
broke
the
seal
with
an
agreeable
anticipation
of
soon
seeing
the
writer
.
   
<EOS>
"
I
send
this
letter
to
meet
you
on
your
arrival
,
Arthur
,
because
I
may
then
be
at
Stoniton
,
whither
I
am
called
by
the
most
painful
duty
it
has
ever
been
given
me
to
perform
,
and
it
is
right
that
you
should
know
what
I
have
to
tell
you
without
delay
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
add
by
one
word
of
reproach
to
the
retribution
that
is
now
falling
on
you
:
any
other
words
that
I
could
write
at
this
moment
must
be
weak
and
unmeaning
by
the
side
of
those
in
which
I
must
tell
you
the
simple
fact
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hetty
Sorrel
is
in
prison
,
and
will
be
tried
on
Friday
for
the
crime
of
child
-
murder
.
"
...
   
<EOS>
Arthur
read
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
started
up
from
his
chair
and
stood
for
a
single
minute
with
a
sense
of
violent
convulsion
in
his
whole
frame
,
as
if
the
life
were
going
out
of
him
with
horrible
throbs
;
but
the
next
minute
he
had
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
still
clutching
the
letter
 
he
was
hurrying
along
the
corridor
,
and
down
the
stairs
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Mills
was
still
there
,
but
Arthur
did
not
see
him
,
as
he
passed
like
a
hunted
man
across
the
hall
and
out
along
the
gravel
.
<EOS>
The
butler
hurried
out
after
him
as
fast
as
his
elderly
limbs
could
run
:
he
guessed
,
he
knew
,
where
the
young
squire
was
going
.
  
<EOS>
When
Mills
got
to
the
stables
,
a
horse
was
being
saddled
,
and
Arthur
was
forcing
himself
to
read
the
remaining
words
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
as
the
horse
was
led
up
to
him
,
and
at
that
moment
caught
sight
of
Mills
'
anxious
face
in
front
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
them
I
'm
gone
 
<EOS>
gone
to
Stoniton
,
"
he
said
in
a
muffled
tone
of
agitation
 
sprang
into
the
saddle
,
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
Prison
  
NEAR
sunset
that
evening
an
elderly
gentleman
was
standing
with
his
back
against
the
smaller
entrance
-
door
of
Stoniton
jail
,
saying
a
few
last
words
to
the
departing
chaplain
.
<EOS>
The
chaplain
walked
away
,
but
the
elderly
gentleman
stood
still
,
looking
down
on
the
pavement
and
stroking
his
chin
with
a
ruminating
air
,
when
he
was
roused
by
a
sweet
clear
woman
's
voice
,
saying
,
"
Can
I
get
into
the
prison
,
if
you
please
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
his
head
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
speaker
for
a
few
moments
without
answering
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
you
before
,
"
he
said
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
remember
preaching
on
the
village
green
at
Hayslope
in
Loamshire
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
surely
.
<EOS>
Are
you
the
gentleman
that
stayed
to
listen
on
horseback
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
want
to
go
into
the
prison
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
go
to
Hetty
Sorrel
,
the
young
woman
who
has
been
condemned
to
death
 
and
to
stay
with
her
,
if
I
may
be
permitted
.
<EOS>
Have
you
power
in
the
prison
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
am
a
magistrate
,
and
can
get
admittance
for
you
.
<EOS>
But
did
you
know
this
criminal
,
Hetty
Sorrel
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
are
kin
.
<EOS>
My
own
aunt
married
her
uncle
,
Martin
Poyser
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
away
at
Leeds
,
and
did
n't
know
of
this
great
trouble
in
time
to
get
here
before
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
,
sir
,
for
the
love
of
our
heavenly
Father
,
to
let
me
go
to
her
and
stay
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
you
know
she
was
condemned
to
death
,
if
you
are
only
just
come
from
Leeds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
my
uncle
since
the
trial
,
sir
.
<EOS>
He
is
gone
back
to
his
home
now
,
and
the
poor
sinner
is
forsaken
of
all
.
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
to
get
leave
for
me
to
be
with
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
Have
you
courage
to
stay
all
night
in
the
prison
?
<EOS>
She
is
very
sullen
,
and
will
scarcely
make
answer
when
she
is
spoken
to
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
it
may
please
God
to
open
her
heart
still
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
us
delay
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
then
,
"
said
the
elderly
gentleman
,
ringing
and
gaining
admission
,
"
I
know
you
have
a
key
to
unlock
hearts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
mechanically
took
off
her
bonnet
and
shawl
as
soon
as
they
were
within
the
prison
court
,
from
the
habit
she
had
of
throwing
them
off
when
she
preached
or
prayed
,
or
visited
the
sick
;
and
when
they
entered
the
jailer
's
room
,
she
laid
them
down
on
a
chair
unthinkingly
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
agitation
visible
in
her
,
but
a
deep
concentrated
calmness
,
as
if
,
even
when
she
was
speaking
,
her
soul
was
in
prayer
reposing
on
an
unseen
support
.
  
<EOS>
After
speaking
to
the
jailer
,
the
magistrate
turned
to
her
and
said
,
"
The
turnkey
will
take
you
to
the
prisoner
's
cell
and
leave
you
there
for
the
night
,
if
you
desire
it
,
but
you
ca
n't
have
a
light
during
the
night
 
<EOS>
it
is
contrary
to
rules
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
Colonel
Townley
:
if
I
can
help
you
in
anything
,
ask
the
jailer
for
my
address
and
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
take
some
interest
in
this
Hetty
Sorrel
,
for
the
sake
of
that
fine
fellow
,
Adam
Bede
.
<EOS>
I
happened
to
see
him
at
Hayslope
the
same
evening
I
heard
you
preach
,
and
recognized
him
in
court
to
-
day
,
ill
as
he
looked
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
,
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
him
?
<EOS>
Can
you
tell
me
where
he
lodges
?
<EOS>
For
my
poor
uncle
was
too
much
weighed
down
with
trouble
to
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Close
by
here
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
all
about
him
of
Mr.
Irwine
.
<EOS>
He
lodges
over
a
tinman
's
shop
,
in
the
street
on
the
right
hand
as
you
entered
the
prison
.
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
school
-
master
with
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
good
-
bye
:
I
wish
you
success
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Farewell
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
grateful
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Dinah
crossed
the
prison
court
with
the
turnkey
,
the
solemn
evening
light
seemed
to
make
the
walls
higher
than
they
were
by
day
,
and
the
sweet
pale
face
in
the
cap
was
more
than
ever
like
a
white
flower
on
this
background
of
gloom
.
<EOS>
The
turnkey
looked
askance
at
her
all
the
while
,
but
never
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
somehow
felt
that
the
sound
of
his
own
rude
voice
would
be
grating
just
then
.
<EOS>
He
struck
a
light
as
they
entered
the
dark
corridor
leading
to
the
condemned
cell
,
and
then
said
in
his
most
civil
tone
,
"
It
'll
be
pretty
nigh
dark
in
the
cell
a'ready
,
but
I
can
stop
with
my
light
a
bit
,
if
you
like
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
friend
,
thank
you
,
"
said
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
go
in
alone
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
like
,
"
said
the
jailer
,
turning
the
harsh
key
in
the
lock
and
opening
the
door
wide
enough
to
admit
Dinah
.
<EOS>
A
jet
of
light
from
his
lantern
fell
on
the
opposite
corner
of
the
cell
,
where
Hetty
was
sitting
on
her
straw
pallet
with
her
face
buried
in
her
knees
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
she
were
asleep
,
and
yet
the
grating
of
the
lock
would
have
been
likely
to
waken
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
closed
again
,
and
the
only
light
in
the
cell
was
that
of
the
evening
sky
,
through
the
small
high
grating
 
enough
to
discern
human
faces
by
.
<EOS>
Dinah
stood
still
for
a
minute
,
hesitating
to
speak
because
Hetty
might
be
asleep
,
and
looking
at
the
motionless
heap
with
a
yearning
heart
.
<EOS>
Then
she
said
,
softly
,
"
Hetty
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
slight
movement
perceptible
in
Hetty
's
frame
 
<EOS>
a
start
such
as
might
have
been
produced
by
a
feeble
electrical
shock
 
but
she
did
not
look
up
.
<EOS>
Dinah
spoke
again
,
in
a
tone
made
stronger
by
irrepressible
emotion
,
"
Hetty
...
<EOS>
it
's
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Again
there
was
a
slight
startled
movement
through
Hetty
's
frame
,
and
without
uncovering
her
face
,
she
raised
her
head
a
little
,
as
if
listening
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hetty
...
<EOS>
Dinah
is
come
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
moment
's
pause
,
Hetty
lifted
her
head
slowly
and
timidly
from
her
knees
and
raised
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
two
pale
faces
were
looking
at
each
other
:
one
with
a
wild
hard
despair
in
it
,
the
other
full
of
sad
yearning
love
.
<EOS>
Dinah
unconsciously
opened
her
arms
and
stretched
them
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
know
me
,
Hetty
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
Dinah
?
<EOS>
Did
you
think
I
would
n't
come
to
you
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
Dinah
's
face
 
at
first
like
an
animal
that
gazes
,
and
gazes
,
and
keeps
aloof
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
come
to
be
with
you
,
Hetty
 
not
to
leave
you
 
to
stay
with
you
 
to
be
your
sister
to
the
last
.
"
  
<EOS>
Slowly
,
while
Dinah
was
speaking
,
Hetty
rose
,
took
a
step
forward
,
and
was
clasped
in
Dinah
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
They
stood
so
a
long
while
,
for
neither
of
them
felt
the
impulse
to
move
apart
again
.
<EOS>
Hetty
,
without
any
distinct
thought
of
it
,
hung
on
this
something
that
was
come
to
clasp
her
now
,
while
she
was
sinking
helpless
in
a
dark
gulf
;
and
Dinah
felt
a
deep
joy
in
the
first
sign
that
her
love
was
welcomed
by
the
wretched
lost
one
.
<EOS>
The
light
got
fainter
as
they
stood
,
and
when
at
last
they
sat
down
on
the
straw
pallet
together
,
their
faces
had
become
indistinct
.
  
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
spoken
.
<EOS>
Dinah
waited
,
hoping
for
a
spontaneous
word
from
Hetty
,
but
she
sat
in
the
same
dull
despair
,
only
clutching
the
hand
that
held
hers
and
leaning
her
cheek
against
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
human
contact
she
clung
to
,
but
she
was
not
the
less
sinking
into
the
dark
gulf
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
began
to
doubt
whether
Hetty
was
conscious
who
it
was
that
sat
beside
her
.
<EOS>
She
thought
suffering
and
fear
might
have
driven
the
poor
sinner
out
of
her
mind
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
borne
in
upon
her
,
as
she
afterwards
said
,
that
she
must
not
hurry
God
's
work
:
we
are
overhasty
to
speak
 
as
if
God
did
not
manifest
himself
by
our
silent
feeling
,
and
make
his
love
felt
through
ours
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
know
how
long
they
sat
in
that
way
,
but
it
got
darker
and
darker
,
till
there
was
only
a
pale
patch
of
light
on
the
opposite
wall
:
all
the
rest
was
darkness
.
<EOS>
But
she
felt
the
Divine
presence
more
and
more
 
nay
,
as
if
she
herself
were
a
part
of
it
,
and
it
was
the
Divine
pity
that
was
beating
in
her
heart
and
was
willing
the
rescue
of
this
helpless
one
.
<EOS>
At
last
she
was
prompted
to
speak
and
find
out
how
far
Hetty
was
conscious
of
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hetty
,
"
she
said
gently
,
"
do
you
know
who
it
is
that
sits
by
your
side
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
Hetty
answered
slowly
,
"
it
's
Dinah
.
"
  
"
And
do
you
remember
the
time
when
we
were
at
the
Hall
Farm
together
,
and
that
night
when
I
told
you
to
be
sure
and
think
of
me
as
a
friend
in
trouble
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Hetty
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
a
pause
,
she
added
,
"
<EOS>
But
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
make
'em
do
anything
.
<EOS>
They
'll
hang
me
<EOS>
o
'
Monday
 
<EOS>
it
's
Friday
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
Hetty
said
the
last
words
,
she
clung
closer
to
Dinah
,
shuddering
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Hetty
,
I
ca
n't
save
you
from
that
death
.
<EOS>
But
is
n't
the
suffering
less
hard
when
you
have
somebody
with
you
,
that
feels
for
you
 
that
you
can
speak
to
,
and
say
what
's
in
your
heart?
<EOS>
...
<EOS>
Yes
,
Hetty
:
you
lean
on
me
:
you
are
glad
to
have
me
with
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
leave
me
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
You
'll
keep
close
to
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Hetty
,
I
wo
n't
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
with
you
to
the
last
....
<EOS>
But
,
Hetty
,
there
is
some
one
else
in
this
cell
besides
me
,
some
one
close
to
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
said
,
in
a
frightened
whisper
,
"
Who
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Some
one
who
has
been
with
you
through
all
your
hours
of
sin
and
trouble
 
who
has
known
every
thought
you
have
had
 
has
seen
where
you
went
,
where
you
lay
down
and
rose
up
again
,
and
all
the
deeds
you
have
tried
to
hide
in
darkness
.
<EOS>
And
on
Monday
,
when
I
ca
n't
follow
you
 
when
my
arms
ca
n't
reach
you
 
when
death
has
parted
us
 
<EOS>
He
who
is
with
us
now
,
and
knows
all
,
will
be
with
you
then
.
<EOS>
It
makes
no
difference
 
whether
we
live
or
die
,
we
are
in
the
presence
of
God
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Dinah
,
wo
n't
nobody
do
anything
for
me
?
<EOS>
Will
they
hang
me
for
certain?
...
<EOS>
I
would
n't
mind
if
they
'd
let
me
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
poor
Hetty
,
death
is
very
dreadful
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
's
dreadful
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
had
a
friend
to
take
care
of
you
after
death
 
in
that
other
world
 
<EOS>
some
one
whose
love
is
greater
than
mine
 
who
can
do
everything?
...
<EOS>
If
God
our
Father
was
your
friend
,
and
was
willing
to
save
you
from
sin
and
suffering
,
so
as
you
should
neither
know
wicked
feelings
nor
pain
again
?
<EOS>
If
you
could
believe
he
loved
you
and
would
help
you
,
as
you
believe
I
love
you
and
will
help
you
,
it
would
n't
be
so
hard
to
die
on
Monday
,
would
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
know
anything
about
it
,
"
Hetty
said
,
with
sullen
sadness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
Hetty
,
you
are
shutting
up
your
soul
against
him
,
by
trying
to
hide
the
truth
.
<EOS>
God
's
love
and
mercy
can
overcome
all
things
 
our
ignorance
,
and
weakness
,
and
all
the
burden
of
our
past
wickedness
 
all
things
but
our
wilful
sin
,
sin
that
we
cling
to
,
and
will
not
give
up
.
<EOS>
You
believe
in
my
love
and
pity
for
you
,
Hetty
,
but
if
you
had
not
let
me
come
near
you
,
if
you
would
n't
have
looked
at
me
or
spoken
to
me
,
you
'd
have
shut
me
out
from
helping
you
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
made
you
feel
my
love
;
I
could
n't
have
told
you
what
I
felt
for
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
shut
God
's
love
out
in
that
way
,
by
clinging
to
sin
....
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
bless
you
while
you
have
one
falsehood
in
your
soul
;
his
pardoning
mercy
ca
n't
reach
you
until
you
open
your
heart
to
him
,
and
say
,
"
I
have
done
this
great
wickedness
;
O
God
,
save
me
,
make
me
pure
from
sin
.
<EOS>
"
While
you
cling
to
one
sin
and
will
not
part
with
it
,
it
must
drag
you
down
to
misery
after
death
,
as
it
has
dragged
you
to
misery
here
in
this
world
,
my
poor
,
poor
Hetty
.
<EOS>
It
is
sin
that
brings
dread
,
and
darkness
,
and
despair
:
there
is
light
and
blessedness
for
us
as
soon
as
we
cast
it
off
.
<EOS>
God
enters
our
souls
then
,
and
teaches
us
,
and
brings
us
strength
and
peace
.
<EOS>
Cast
it
off
now
,
Hetty
 
now
:
confess
the
wickedness
you
have
done
 
the
sin
you
have
been
guilty
of
against
your
Heavenly
Father
.
<EOS>
Let
us
kneel
down
together
,
for
we
are
in
the
presence
of
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
obeyed
Dinah
's
movement
,
and
sank
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
They
still
held
each
other
's
hands
,
and
there
was
long
silence
.
<EOS>
Then
Dinah
said
,
"
Hetty
,
we
are
before
God
.
<EOS>
He
is
waiting
for
you
to
tell
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Still
there
was
silence
.
<EOS>
At
last
Hetty
spoke
,
in
a
tone
of
beseeching
    
<EOS>
"
Dinah
...
help
me
...
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
feel
anything
like
you
...
<EOS>
my
heart
is
hard
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
held
the
clinging
hand
,
and
all
her
soul
went
forth
in
her
voice
:
   
"
Jesus
,
thou
present
Saviour
!
<EOS>
Thou
hast
known
the
depths
of
all
sorrow
:
thou
hast
entered
that
black
darkness
where
God
is
not
,
and
hast
uttered
the
cry
of
the
forsaken
.
<EOS>
Come
Lord
,
and
gather
of
the
fruits
of
thy
travail
and
thy
pleading
.
<EOS>
Stretch
forth
thy
hand
,
thou
who
art
mighty
to
save
to
the
uttermost
,
and
rescue
<EOS>
this
lost
one
.
<EOS>
She
is
clothed
round
with
thick
darkness
.
<EOS>
The
fetters
of
her
sin
are
upon
her
,
and
she
can
not
stir
to
come
to
thee
.
<EOS>
She
can
only
feel
her
heart
is
hard
,
and
she
is
helpless
.
<EOS>
She
cries
to
me
,
thy
weak
creature
....
<EOS>
Saviour
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
blind
cry
to
thee
.
<EOS>
Hear
it
!
<EOS>
Pierce
the
darkness
!
<EOS>
Look
upon
her
with
thy
face
of
love
and
sorrow
that
thou
didst
turn
on
him
who
denied
thee
,
and
melt
her
hard
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
See
,
Lord
,
I
bring
her
,
as
they
of
old
brought
the
sick
and
helpless
,
and
thou
didst
heal
them
.
<EOS>
I
bear
her
on
my
arms
and
carry
her
before
thee
.
<EOS>
Fear
and
trembling
have
taken
hold
on
her
,
but
she
trembles
only
at
the
pain
and
death
of
the
body
.
<EOS>
Breathe
upon
her
thy
life
-
giving
Spirit
,
and
put
a
new
fear
within
her
 
the
fear
of
her
sin
.
<EOS>
Make
her
dread
to
keep
the
accursed
thing
within
her
soul
.
<EOS>
Make
her
feel
the
presence
of
the
living
God
,
who
beholds
all
the
past
,
to
whom
the
darkness
is
as
noonday
;
who
is
waiting
now
,
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
for
her
to
turn
to
him
,
and
confess
her
sin
,
and
cry
for
mercy
 
now
,
before
the
night
of
death
comes
,
and
the
moment
of
pardon
is
for
ever
fled
,
like
yesterday
that
returneth
not
.
  
<EOS>
"
Saviour
!
<EOS>
It
is
yet
time
 
time
to
snatch
this
poor
soul
from
everlasting
darkness
.
<EOS>
I
believe
 
I
believe
in
thy
infinite
love
.
<EOS>
What
is
my
love
or
my
pleading
?
<EOS>
It
is
quenched
in
thine
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
clasp
her
in
my
weak
arms
and
urge
her
with
my
weak
pity
.
<EOS>
Thou
 
thou
wilt
breathe
on
the
dead
soul
,
and
it
shall
arise
from
the
unanswering
sleep
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yea
,
Lord
,
I
see
thee
,
coming
through
the
darkness
coming
,
like
the
morning
,
with
healing
on
thy
wings
.
<EOS>
The
marks
of
thy
agony
are
upon
thee
 
<EOS>
I
see
,
I
see
thou
art
able
and
willing
to
save
 
thou
<EOS>
wilt
not
let
her
perish
for
ever
.
<EOS>
Come
,
mighty
Saviour
!
<EOS>
Let
the
dead
hear
thy
voice
.
<EOS>
Let
the
eyes
of
the
blind
be
opened
.
<EOS>
Let
her
see
that
God
encompasses
her
.
<EOS>
Let
her
tremble
at
nothing
but
at
the
sin
that
cuts
her
off
from
him
.
<EOS>
Melt
the
hard
heart
.
<EOS>
Unseal
the
closed
lips
<EOS>
:
make
her
cry
with
her
whole
soul
,
"
Father
,
I
have
sinned
.
"
...
<EOS>
"
  
"
Dinah
,
"
Hetty
sobbed
out
,
throwing
her
arms
round
Dinah
's
neck
,
"
I
will
speak
...
I
will
tell
...
I
wo
n't
hide
it
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
the
tears
and
sobs
were
too
violent
.
<EOS>
Dinah
raised
her
gently
from
her
knees
and
seated
her
on
the
pallet
again
,
sitting
down
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
time
before
the
convulsed
throat
was
quiet
,
and
even
then
they
sat
some
time
in
stillness
and
darkness
,
holding
each
other
's
hands
.
<EOS>
At
last
Hetty
whispered
,
"
I
did
do
it
,
Dinah
...
<EOS>
I
buried
it
in
the
wood
...
<EOS>
the
little
baby
...
<EOS>
and
it
cried
...
<EOS>
I
heard
it
cry
...
ever
such
a
way
off
...
all
night
...
<EOS>
and
I
went
back
because
it
cried
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
,
and
then
spoke
hurriedly
in
a
louder
,
pleading
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
thought
perhaps
it
would
n't
die
 
there
<EOS>
might
somebody
find
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
kill
it
 
<EOS>
I
did
n't
kill
it
myself
.
<EOS>
I
put
it
down
there
and
covered
it
up
,
and
when
I
came
back
it
was
gone
....
<EOS>
It
was
because
I
was
so
very
miserable
,
Dinah
...
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
where
to
go
...
<EOS>
and
I
tried
to
kill
myself
before
,
and
I
could
n't
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
tried
so
to
drown
myself
in
the
pool
,
and
I
could
n't
.
<EOS>
I
went
to
Windsor
 
<EOS>
I
ran
away
 
<EOS>
did
you
know
?
<EOS>
I
went
to
find
him
,
as
he
might
take
care
of
me
;
and
he
was
gone
;
and
then
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
I
daredn't
go
back
home
again
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
have
bore
to
look
at
anybody
,
for
they
'd
have
scorned
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
o
'
you
sometimes
,
and
thought
I
'd
come
to
you
,
for
I
did
n't
think
you
'd
be
cross
with
me
,
and
cry
shame
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
could
tell
you
.
<EOS>
But
then
the
other
folks
'
ud
come
to
know
it
at
last
,
and
I
could
n't
bear
that
.
<EOS>
It
was
partly
thinking
o
<EOS>
'
you
made
me
come
toward
Stoniton
;
and
,
besides
,
I
was
so
frightened
at
going
wandering
about
till
I
was
a
beggar
-
woman
,
and
had
nothing
;
and
sometimes
it
seemed
as
if
I
must
go
back
to
the
farm
sooner
than
that
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
it
was
so
dreadful
,
Dinah
...
<EOS>
I
was
so
miserable
...
<EOS>
I
wished
I
'd
never
been
born
into
this
world
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
like
to
go
into
the
green
fields
again
 
<EOS>
I
hated
'em
<EOS>
so
in
my
misery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
paused
again
,
as
if
the
sense
of
the
past
were
too
strong
upon
her
for
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
then
I
got
to
Stoniton
,
and
I
began
to
feel
frightened
that
night
,
because
I
was
so
near
home
.
<EOS>
And
then
the
little
baby
was
born
,
when
I
did
n't
expect
it
;
and
the
thought
came
into
my
mind
that
I
might
get
rid
of
it
and
go
home
again
.
<EOS>
The
thought
came
all
of
a
sudden
,
as
I
was
lying
in
the
bed
,
and
it
got
stronger
and
stronger
...
<EOS>
I
longed
so
to
go
back
again
...
<EOS>
I
could
n't
bear
being
so
lonely
and
coming
to
beg
for
want
.
<EOS>
And
it
gave
me
strength
and
resolution
to
get
up
and
dress
myself
.
<EOS>
I
felt
I
must
do
it
...
<EOS>
I
did
n't
know
<EOS>
how
...
<EOS>
I
thought
I
'd
find
a
pool
,
if
I
could
,
like
that
other
,
in
the
corner
of
the
field
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
woman
went
out
,
I
felt
as
if
I
was
strong
enough
to
do
anything
...
<EOS>
I
thought
I
should
get
rid
of
all
my
misery
,
and
go
back
home
,
and
never
let
'em
know
why
I
ran
away
<EOS>
I
put
on
my
bonnet
and
shawl
,
and
went
out
into
the
dark
street
,
with
the
baby
under
my
cloak
;
and
I
walked
fast
till
I
got
into
a
street
a
good
way
off
,
and
there
was
a
public
,
and
I
got
some
warm
stuff
to
drink
and
some
bread
.
<EOS>
And
I
walked
on
and
on
,
and
I
hardly
felt
the
ground
I
trod
on
;
and
it
got
lighter
,
<EOS>
for
there
came
the
moon
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Dinah
,
it
frightened
me
when
it
first
looked
at
me
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
clouds
 
<EOS>
it
never
looked
so
before
;
and
I
turned
out
of
the
road
into
the
fields
,
for
I
was
afraid
<EOS>
o
'
meeting
anybody
with
the
moon
shining
on
me
.
<EOS>
And
I
came
to
a
haystack
,
where
I
thought
I
could
lie
down
and
keep
myself
warm
all
night
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
place
cut
into
it
,
where
I
could
make
me
a
bed
,
and
I
lay
comfortable
,
and
the
baby
was
warm
against
me
;
and
I
must
have
gone
to
sleep
for
a
good
while
,
for
when
I
woke
it
was
morning
,
but
not
very
light
,
and
the
baby
was
crying
.
<EOS>
And
I
saw
a
wood
a
little
way
off
...
<EOS>
I
thought
there
'd
perhaps
be
a
ditch
or
a
pond
there
...
and
it
was
<EOS>
so
early
I
thought
I
could
hide
the
child
there
,
and
get
a
long
way
off
before
folks
was
up
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
thought
I
'd
go
home
 
<EOS>
I
'd
get
rides
in
carts
and
go
home
and
tell
'em
<EOS>
I
'd
been
to
try
and
see
for
a
place
,
and
could
n't
get
one
.
<EOS>
I
longed
so
for
it
,
<EOS>
Dinah
,
I
longed
so
to
be
safe
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
I
felt
about
the
baby
.
<EOS>
I
seemed
to
hate
it
 
<EOS>
it
was
like
a
heavy
weight
hanging
round
my
neck
;
and
yet
its
crying
went
through
me
,
and
<EOS>
I
daredn't
look
at
its
little
hands
and
face
.
<EOS>
But
I
went
on
to
the
wood
,
and
I
walked
about
,
but
there
was
no
water
....
<EOS>
"
  
Hetty
shuddered
.
<EOS>
She
was
silent
for
some
moments
,
and
when
she
began
again
,
it
was
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
a
place
where
there
was
lots
of
chips
and
turf
,
and
I
sat
down
on
the
trunk
of
a
tree
to
think
what
I
should
do
.
<EOS>
And
all
of
a
sudden
I
saw
a
hole
under
the
nut
-
tree
,
like
a
little
grave
.
<EOS>
And
it
darted
into
me
like
lightning
 
<EOS>
I
'd
lay
the
baby
there
and
cover
it
with
the
grass
and
the
chips
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
kill
it
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
And
I
'd
done
it
in
a
minute
;
and
,
oh
,
it
cried
so
,
Dinah
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
cover
it
quite
up
 
<EOS>
I
thought
perhaps
<EOS>
somebody
'
ud
come
and
take
care
of
it
,
and
then
it
would
n't
die
.
<EOS>
And
I
made
haste
out
of
the
wood
,
but
I
could
hear
it
crying
all
the
while
;
and
when
I
got
out
into
the
fields
,
it
was
as
if
I
was
held
fast
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
go
away
,
for
all
I
wanted
so
to
go
.
<EOS>
And
I
sat
against
the
haystack
to
watch
if
anybody
'
ud
come
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
hungry
,
and
I
'd
only
a
bit
of
bread
left
,
but
I
could
n't
go
away
.
<EOS>
And
after
ever
such
a
while
 
hours
and
hours
 
the
man
came
 
him
in
a
smock
-
frock
,
and
he
looked
at
me
<EOS>
so
,
I
was
frightened
,
and
I
made
haste
and
went
on
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
was
going
to
the
wood
and
would
perhaps
find
the
baby
.
<EOS>
And
I
went
right
on
,
till
I
came
to
a
village
,
a
long
way
off
from
the
wood
,
and
I
was
very
sick
,
and
faint
,
and
hungry
.
<EOS>
I
got
something
to
eat
there
,
and
bought
a
loaf
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
frightened
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
baby
crying
,
and
thought
the
other
folks
heard
it
too
 
<EOS>
and
I
went
on
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
so
tired
,
and
it
was
getting
towards
dark
.
<EOS>
And
at
last
,
by
the
roadside
there
was
a
barn
 
ever
such
a
way
off
any
house
 
like
the
barn
in
Abbot
's
Close
,
and
I
thought
I
could
go
in
there
and
hide
myself
among
the
hay
and
straw
,
and
nobody
'
ud
be
likely
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
went
in
,
and
it
was
half
full
o
'
trusses
of
straw
,
and
there
was
some
hay
too
.
<EOS>
And
I
made
myself
a
bed
,
ever
so
far
behind
,
where
nobody
could
find
me
;
and
I
was
so
tired
and
weak
<EOS>
,
I
went
to
sleep
....
<EOS>
But
oh
,
the
baby
's
crying
kept
waking
me
,
and
I
thought
that
man
as
looked
at
me
so
was
come
and
laying
hold
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
have
slept
a
long
while
at
last
,
though
I
did
n't
know
,
for
when
I
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
barn
,
I
did
n't
know
whether
it
was
night
or
morning
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
morning
,
for
it
kept
getting
lighter
,
and
I
turned
back
the
way
I
'd
come
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
help
it
,
Dinah
;
it
was
the
baby
's
crying
made
me
go
 
<EOS>
and
yet
I
was
frightened
to
death
.
<EOS>
I
thought
that
man
in
the
smock
-
frock
'
ud
see
me
and
know
I
put
the
baby
there
.
<EOS>
But
I
went
on
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
I
'd
left
off
thinking
about
going
home
 
<EOS>
it
had
gone
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
my
mind
.
<EOS>
I
saw
nothing
but
that
place
in
the
wood
where
I
'd
buried
the
baby
...
<EOS>
I
see
it
now
.
<EOS>
Oh
Dinah
!
<EOS>
shall
I
allays
see
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
clung
round
Dinah
and
shuddered
again
.
<EOS>
The
silence
seemed
long
before
she
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
met
nobody
,
for
it
was
very
early
,
and
I
got
into
the
wood
....
<EOS>
I
knew
the
way
to
the
place
...
<EOS>
the
place
against
the
nut
-
tree
;
and
I
could
hear
it
crying
at
every
step
....
<EOS>
I
thought
it
was
alive
....
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
was
frightened
or
glad
...
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
felt
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
I
was
in
the
wood
and
heard
the
cry
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
I
felt
till
I
saw
the
baby
was
gone
.
<EOS>
And
when
I
'd
put
it
there
,
I
thought
I
should
like
somebody
to
find
it
and
save
it
from
dying
;
but
when
I
saw
it
was
gone
,
I
was
struck
like
a
stone
,
with
fear
.
<EOS>
I
never
thought
o
'
stirring
,
I
felt
so
weak
.
<EOS>
I
knew
I
could
n't
run
away
,
and
everybody
as
saw
me
'
ud
know
about
the
baby
.
<EOS>
My
heart
went
like
a
stone
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
wish
or
try
for
anything
;
it
seemed
like
as
if
I
should
stay
there
for
ever
,
and
nothing
'
ud
ever
change
.
<EOS>
But
they
came
and
took
me
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
was
silent
,
but
she
shuddered
again
,
as
if
there
was
still
something
behind
;
and
Dinah
waited
,
for
her
heart
was
so
full
that
tears
must
come
before
words
.
<EOS>
At
last
Hetty
burst
out
,
with
a
sob
,
"
Dinah
,
do
you
think
God
will
take
away
that
crying
and
the
place
in
the
wood
,
now
I
've
told
everything
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
pray
,
poor
sinner
.
<EOS>
Let
us
fall
on
our
knees
again
,
and
pray
to
the
God
of
all
mercy
.

The
Hours
of
Suspense
  
<EOS>
ON
Sunday
morning
,
when
the
church
bells
in
Stoniton
were
ringing
for
morning
service
,
Bartle
Massey
re
-
entered
Adam
's
room
,
after
a
short
absence
,
and
said
,
"
Adam
,
here
's
a
visitor
wants
to
see
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
seated
with
is
back
towards
the
door
,
but
he
started
up
and
turned
round
instantly
,
with
a
flushed
face
and
an
eager
look
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
even
thinner
and
more
worn
than
we
have
seen
it
before
,
but
he
was
washed
and
shaven
this
Sunday
morning
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
any
news
?
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Keep
yourself
quiet
,
my
lad
,
"
said
Bartle
;
"
keep
quiet
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
what
you
're
thinking
of
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
young
Methodist
woman
come
from
the
prison
.
<EOS>
She
's
at
<EOS>
the
bottom
o
'
the
stairs
,
and
wants
to
know
if
you
think
well
to
see
her
,
for
she
has
something
to
say
to
you
about
that
poor
castaway
;
but
she
would
n't
come
in
without
your
leave
,
she
said
.
<EOS>
She
thought
you
'd
perhaps
like
to
go
out
and
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
These
preaching
women
are
not
so
back'ard
commonly
,
"
Bartle
muttered
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
her
to
come
in
,
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
standing
with
his
face
towards
the
door
,
and
as
Dinah
entered
,
lifting
up
her
mild
grey
eyes
towards
him
,
she
saw
at
once
the
great
change
that
had
come
since
the
day
when
she
had
looked
up
at
the
tall
man
in
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
trembling
in
her
clear
voice
as
she
put
her
hand
into
his
and
said
,
"
Be
comforted
,
Adam
Bede
,
the
Lord
has
not
forsaken
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Bless
you
for
coming
to
her
,
"
Adam
said
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Massey
brought
me
word
yesterday
as
you
was
come
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
could
neither
of
them
say
any
more
just
yet
,
but
stood
before
each
other
in
silence
;
and
Bartle
Massey
,
too
,
who
had
put
on
his
spectacles
,
seemed
transfixed
,
examining
Dinah
's
face
.
<EOS>
But
he
recovered
himself
first
,
and
said
,
"
Sit
down
,
young
woman
,
sit
down
,
"
placing
the
chair
for
her
and
retiring
to
his
old
seat
on
the
bed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
friend
;
I
wo
n't
sit
down
,
"
said
Dinah
,
"
for
I
must
hasten
back
.
<EOS>
She
entreated
me
not
to
stay
long
away
.
<EOS>
What
I
came
for
,
Adam
Bede
,
was
to
pray
you
to
go
and
see
the
poor
sinner
and
bid
her
farewell
.
<EOS>
She
desires
to
ask
your
forgiveness
,
and
it
is
meet
<EOS>
you
should
see
her
to
-
day
,
rather
than
in
the
early
morning
,
when
the
time
will
be
short
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
stood
trembling
,
and
at
last
sank
down
on
his
chair
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
wo
n't
be
,
"
he
said
,
"
it
'll
be
put
off
 
there
'll
perhaps
come
a
pardon
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
said
there
was
hope
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
I
need
n't
quite
give
it
up
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
blessed
thought
to
me
,
"
said
Dinah
,
her
eyes
filling
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
fearful
thing
hurrying
her
soul
away
so
fast
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
let
what
will
be
,
"
she
added
presently
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
surely
come
,
and
let
her
speak
the
words
that
are
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Although
her
poor
soul
is
very
dark
and
discerns
little
beyond
the
things
of
the
flesh
,
she
is
no
longer
hard
.
<EOS>
She
is
contrite
,
she
has
confessed
all
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
pride
of
her
heart
has
given
way
,
and
she
leans
on
me
for
help
and
desires
to
be
taught
.
<EOS>
This
fills
me
with
trust
,
for
I
can
not
but
think
that
the
brethren
sometimes
err
in
measuring
the
Divine
love
by
the
sinner
's
knowledge
.
<EOS>
She
is
going
to
write
a
letter
to
the
friends
at
the
Hall
Farm
for
me
to
give
them
when
she
is
gone
,
and
when
I
told
her
you
were
here
,
she
said
,
"
I
should
like
to
say
good
-
bye
to
Adam
and
ask
him
to
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
come
,
Adam
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
will
even
now
come
back
with
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
,
"
Adam
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
say
good
-
bye
while
there
's
any
hope
.
<EOS>
I
'm
listening
,
and
listening
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
think
o
'
nothing
but
that
.
<EOS>
It
ca
n't
be
as
she
'll
die
that
shameful
death
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
bring
my
mind
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
got
up
from
his
chair
again
and
looked
away
out
of
the
window
,
while
Dinah
stood
with
compassionate
patience
.
<EOS>
In
a
minute
or
two
he
turned
round
and
said
,
"
I
will
come
,
Dinah
...
to
-
morrow
morning
...
<EOS>
if
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
I
may
have
more
strength
to
bear
it
,
if
I
know
it
must
be
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
I
forgive
her
;
tell
her
I
will
come
 
at
the
very
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
urge
you
against
the
voice
of
your
own
heart
,
"
said
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
hasten
back
to
her
,
for
it
is
wonderful
how
she
clings
now
,
and
was
not
willing
to
let
me
out
of
her
sight
.
<EOS>
She
used
never
to
make
any
return
to
my
affection
before
,
but
now
tribulation
has
opened
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
Our
heavenly
Father
comfort
you
and
strengthen
you
to
bear
all
things
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Dinah
put
out
her
hand
,
and
Adam
pressed
it
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
Bartle
Massey
was
getting
up
to
lift
the
stiff
latch
of
the
door
for
her
,
but
before
he
could
reach
it
,
she
had
said
gently
,
"
Farewell
,
friend
,
"
and
was
gone
,
with
her
light
step
down
the
stairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Bartle
,
taking
off
his
spectacles
and
putting
them
into
his
pocket
,
"
if
there
must
be
women
to
make
trouble
in
the
world
,
it
's
but
fair
<EOS>
there
should
be
women
to
be
comforters
under
it
;
and
she
's
one
 
<EOS>
she
's
one
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
<EOS>
she
's
a
Methodist
;
but
there
's
no
getting
a
woman
without
some
foolishness
or
other
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
never
went
to
bed
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
of
suspense
,
heightening
with
every
hour
that
brought
him
nearer
the
fatal
moment
,
was
too
great
,
and
in
spite
of
his
entreaties
,
in
spite
of
his
promises
that
he
would
be
perfectly
quiet
,
the
schoolmaster
watched
too
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
does
it
matter
to
me
,
lad
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Bartle
said
:
"
a
night
's
sleep
more
or
less
?
<EOS>
I
shall
sleep
long
enough
,
by
and
by
,
underground
.
<EOS>
Let
me
keep
thee
company
in
trouble
while
I
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
and
dreary
night
in
that
small
chamber
.
<EOS>
Adam
would
sometimes
get
up
and
tread
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
short
space
from
wall
to
wall
;
then
he
would
sit
down
and
hide
his
face
,
and
no
sound
would
be
heard
but
the
ticking
of
the
watch
on
the
table
,
or
the
falling
of
a
cinder
from
the
fire
which
the
schoolmaster
carefully
tended
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
would
burst
out
into
vehement
speech
,
"
If
I
could
ha
'
done
anything
to
save
her
 
if
my
bearing
anything
would
ha
'
done
any
good
...
<EOS>
but
t
'
have
to
sit
still
,
and
know
it
,
and
do
nothing
...
<EOS>
it
's
hard
for
a
man
to
bear
...
and
to
think
o
'
what
might
ha
'
been
now
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
HIM
....
<EOS>
O
God
,
it
's
the
very
day
we
should
ha
'
been
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
my
lad
,
"
said
Bartle
tenderly
,
<EOS>
"
it
's
heavy
 
<EOS>
it
's
heavy
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
remember
this
:
when
you
thought
of
marrying
her
,
you
'd
a
notion
she
'd
got
another
sort
of
a
nature
inside
her
.
<EOS>
You
did
n't
think
she
could
have
got
hardened
in
that
little
while
to
do
what
she
's
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
 
<EOS>
I
know
that
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
she
was
loving
and
tender
-
hearted
,
and
would
n't
tell
a
lie
,
or
act
deceitful
.
<EOS>
How
could
I
think
any
other
way
?
<EOS>
And
if
he
'd
never
come
near
her
,
and
I
'd
married
her
,
and
been
loving
to
her
,
and
took
care
of
her
,
she
might
never
ha
'
done
anything
bad
.
<EOS>
What
would
it
ha
'
signified
 
<EOS>
my
having
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
trouble
with
her
?
<EOS>
It
'
ud
ha
'
been
nothing
to
this
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
knowing
,
my
lad
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
knowing
what
might
have
come
.
<EOS>
The
smart
's
bad
for
you
to
bear
now
:
you
must
have
time
 
<EOS>
you
must
have
time
.
<EOS>
But
I
've
that
opinion
of
you
,
that
you
'll
rise
above
it
all
and
be
a
man
again
,
and
there
may
good
come
out
of
this
that
we
do
n't
see
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
come
out
of
it
!
"
said
Adam
passionately
.
<EOS>
"
That
does
n't
alter
th
'
evil
:
HER
ruin
ca
n't
be
undone
.
<EOS>
I
hate
that
talk
o
'
people
,
as
if
there
was
a
way
o
'
making
amends
for
everything
.
<EOS>
They
'd
more
need
be
brought
to
see
as
the
wrong
they
do
can
never
be
altered
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
's
spoiled
his
fellow
-
creatur
's
life
,
he
's
no
right
to
comfort
himself
with
thinking
good
<EOS>
may
come
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
Somebody
else
's
good
does
n't
alter
her
shame
and
misery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
lad
,
well
,
"
said
Bartle
,
<EOS>
in
a
gentle
tone
,
strangely
in
contrast
with
his
usual
peremptoriness
and
impatience
of
contradiction
,
"
it
's
likely
enough
I
talk
foolishness
.
<EOS>
I
'm
an
old
fellow
,
and
it
's
a
good
many
years
since
I
was
in
trouble
myself
.
<EOS>
It
's
easy
finding
reasons
why
other
folks
should
be
patient
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
penitently
,
"
I
'm
very
hot
and
hasty
.
<EOS>
I
owe
you
something
different
;
but
you
must
n't
take
it
ill
of
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
I
,
lad
 
not
I.
"
  
<EOS>
So
the
night
wore
on
in
agitation
till
the
chill
dawn
and
the
growing
light
brought
the
tremulous
quiet
that
comes
on
the
brink
of
despair
.
<EOS>
There
would
soon
be
no
more
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
to
the
prison
now
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
,
when
he
saw
the
hand
of
his
watch
at
six
.
<EOS>
"
If
there
's
any
news
come
,
we
shall
hear
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
people
were
astir
already
,
moving
rapidly
,
in
one
direction
,
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Adam
tried
not
to
think
where
they
were
going
,
as
they
hurried
past
him
in
that
short
space
between
his
lodging
and
the
prison
gates
.
<EOS>
He
was
thankful
when
the
gates
shut
him
in
from
seeing
those
eager
people
.
  
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
;
there
was
no
news
come
 
<EOS>
no
pardon
 
<EOS>
no
reprieve
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
lingered
in
the
court
half
an
hour
before
he
could
bring
himself
to
send
word
to
Dinah
that
he
was
come
.
<EOS>
But
a
voice
caught
his
ear
:
he
could
not
shut
out
the
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
cart
is
to
set
off
at
half
-
past
seven
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
must
be
said
 
<EOS>
the
last
good
-
bye
<EOS>
:
there
was
no
help
.
  
<EOS>
In
ten
minutes
from
that
time
,
Adam
was
at
the
door
of
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Dinah
had
sent
him
word
that
she
could
not
come
to
him
;
she
could
not
leave
Hetty
one
moment
;
but
Hetty
was
prepared
for
the
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
He
could
not
see
her
when
he
entered
,
for
agitation
deadened
his
senses
,
and
the
dim
cell
was
almost
dark
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
stood
a
moment
after
the
door
closed
behind
him
,
trembling
and
stupefied
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
began
to
see
through
the
dimness
 
to
see
the
dark
eyes
lifted
up
to
him
once
more
,
but
with
no
smile
in
them
.
<EOS>
O
God
,
how
sad
they
looked
!
<EOS>
The
last
time
they
had
met
his
was
when
he
parted
from
her
with
his
heart
full
of
joyous
hopeful
love
,
and
they
looked
out
with
a
tearful
smile
from
a
pink
,
dimpled
,
childish
face
.
<EOS>
The
face
was
marble
now
;
the
sweet
lips
were
pallid
and
half
-
open
and
quivering
;
the
dimples
were
all
gone
 
all
but
one
,
that
never
went
;
and
the
eyes
 
O
,
<EOS>
the
worst
of
all
was
the
likeness
they
had
to
Hetty
's
.
<EOS>
They
were
Hetty
's
eyes
looking
at
him
with
that
mournful
gaze
,
as
if
she
had
come
back
to
him
from
the
dead
to
tell
him
of
her
misery
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
clinging
close
to
Dinah
;
her
cheek
was
against
Dinah
's
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
her
last
faint
strength
and
hope
lay
in
that
contact
,
and
the
pitying
love
that
shone
out
from
Dinah
's
face
looked
like
a
visible
pledge
of
the
Invisible
Mercy
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
sad
eyes
met
 
when
Hetty
and
Adam
looked
at
each
other
 
<EOS>
she
felt
the
change
in
him
too
,
and
it
seemed
to
strike
her
with
fresh
fear
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
seen
any
being
whose
face
seemed
to
reflect
the
change
in
herself
:
<EOS>
Adam
was
a
new
image
of
the
dreadful
past
and
the
dreadful
present
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
more
as
she
looked
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
him
,
Hetty
<EOS>
,
"
Dinah
said
;
"
tell
him
what
is
in
your
heart
.
"
  
<EOS>
Hetty
obeyed
her
,
like
a
little
child
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
...
I'm
very
sorry
...
<EOS>
I
behaved
very
wrong
to
you
...
<EOS>
will
you
forgive
me
...
before
I
die
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
answered
with
a
half
-
sob
,
"
Yes
,
I
forgive
thee
Hetty
.
<EOS>
I
forgave
thee
long
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
seemed
to
Adam
as
if
his
brain
would
burst
with
the
anguish
of
meeting
Hetty
's
eyes
in
the
first
moments
,
but
the
sound
of
her
voice
uttering
these
penitent
words
touched
a
chord
which
had
been
less
strained
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
sense
of
relief
from
what
was
becoming
unbearable
,
and
the
rare
tears
came
 
they
had
never
come
before
,
since
he
had
hung
on
Seth
's
neck
in
the
beginning
of
his
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
Hetty
made
an
involuntary
movement
towards
him
,
some
of
the
love
that
she
had
once
lived
in
the
midst
of
was
come
near
her
again
.
<EOS>
She
kept
hold
of
Dinah
's
hand
,
but
she
went
up
to
Adam
and
said
timidly
,
"
Will
you
kiss
me
again
,
Adam
,
for
all
I
've
been
so
wicked
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
took
the
blanched
wasted
hand
she
put
out
to
him
,
and
they
gave
each
other
the
solemn
unspeakable
kiss
of
a
lifelong
parting
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
tell
him
,
"
Hetty
said
,
in
rather
a
stronger
voice
,
"
tell
him
...
<EOS>
for
there
's
nobody
else
to
tell
him
...
as
I
went
after
him
and
could
n't
find
him
...
<EOS>
and
I
hated
him
and
cursed
him
once
...
<EOS>
but
Dinah
says
I
should
forgive
him
...
<EOS>
and
I
try
...
for
else
God
wo
n't
forgive
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
noise
at
the
door
of
the
cell
now
 
<EOS>
the
key
was
being
turned
in
the
lock
,
and
when
the
door
opened
,
Adam
saw
indistinctly
that
there
were
several
faces
there
.
<EOS>
He
was
too
agitated
to
see
more
 
even
to
see
that
Mr.
Irwine
's
face
was
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
the
last
preparations
were
beginning
,
and
he
could
stay
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Room
was
silently
made
for
him
to
depart
,
and
he
went
to
his
chamber
in
loneliness
,
leaving
Bartle
Massey
to
watch
and
see
the
end
.
    
<EOS>
The
Last
Moment
  
<EOS>
IT
was
a
sight
that
some
people
remembered
better
even
than
their
own
sorrows
 
<EOS>
the
sight
in
that
grey
clear
morning
,
when
the
fatal
cart
with
the
two
young
women
in
it
was
descried
by
the
waiting
watching
multitude
,
cleaving
its
way
towards
the
hideous
symbol
of
a
deliberately
inflicted
sudden
death
.
  
<EOS>
All
Stoniton
had
heard
of
Dinah
Morris
,
the
young
Methodist
woman
who
had
brought
the
obstinate
criminal
to
confess
,
and
there
was
as
much
eagerness
to
see
her
as
to
see
the
wretched
Hetty
.
  
<EOS>
But
Dinah
was
hardly
conscious
of
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
When
Hetty
had
caught
sight
of
the
vast
crowd
in
the
distance
,
she
had
clutched
Dinah
convulsively
.
  
<EOS>
"
Close
your
eyes
,
Hetty
,
"
Dinah
said
,
"
and
let
us
pray
without
ceasing
to
God
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
in
a
low
voice
,
as
the
cart
went
slowly
along
through
the
midst
of
the
gazing
crowd
,
she
poured
forth
her
soul
with
the
wrestling
intensity
of
a
last
pleading
,
for
the
trembling
creature
that
clung
to
her
and
clutched
her
as
the
only
visible
sign
of
love
and
pity
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
did
not
know
that
the
crowd
was
silent
,
gazing
at
her
with
a
sort
of
awe
 
she
did
not
even
know
how
near
they
were
to
the
fatal
spot
,
when
the
cart
stopped
,
and
she
shrank
appalled
at
a
loud
shout
hideous
to
her
ear
,
like
a
vast
yell
of
demons
.
<EOS>
Hetty
's
shriek
mingled
with
the
sound
,
and
they
clasped
each
other
in
mutual
horror
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
a
shout
of
execration
 
not
a
yell
of
exultant
cruelty
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
shout
of
sudden
excitement
at
the
appearance
of
a
horseman
cleaving
the
crowd
at
full
gallop
.
<EOS>
The
horse
is
hot
and
distressed
,
but
answers
to
the
desperate
spurring
;
the
rider
looks
as
if
his
eyes
were
glazed
by
madness
,
and
he
saw
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
was
unseen
by
others
.
<EOS>
See
,
he
has
something
in
his
hand
 
<EOS>
he
is
holding
it
up
as
if
it
were
a
signal
.
  
<EOS>
The
Sheriff
knows
him
:
it
is
Arthur
Donnithorne
,
carrying
in
his
hand
a
hard
-
won
release
from
death
.
    
<EOS>
Another
Meeting
in
the
Wood
  
<EOS>
THE
next
day
,
at
evening
,
two
men
were
walking
from
opposite
points
towards
the
same
scene
,
drawn
thither
by
a
common
memory
.
<EOS>
The
scene
was
the
Grove
by
Donnithorne
Chase
:
you
know
who
the
men
were
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
squire
's
funeral
had
taken
place
that
morning
,
the
will
had
been
read
,
and
now
in
the
first
breathing
-
space
,
Arthur
Donnithorne
had
come
out
for
a
lonely
walk
,
that
he
might
look
fixedly
at
the
new
future
before
him
and
confirm
himself
in
a
sad
resolution
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
could
do
that
best
in
the
Grove
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
too
had
come
from
Stontion
on
Monday
evening
,
and
to
-
day
he
had
not
left
home
,
except
to
go
to
the
family
at
the
Hall
Farm
and
tell
them
everything
that
Mr.
Irwine
had
left
untold
.
<EOS>
He
had
agreed
with
the
Poysers
that
he
would
follow
them
to
their
new
neighbourhood
,
wherever
that
might
be
,
for
he
meant
to
give
up
the
management
of
the
woods
,
and
,
as
soon
as
it
was
practicable
,
he
would
wind
up
his
business
with
Jonathan
Burge
and
settle
with
his
mother
and
Seth
in
a
home
within
reach
of
the
friends
to
whom
he
felt
bound
by
a
mutual
sorrow
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seth
and
me
are
sure
to
find
work
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
man
that
's
got
our
trade
at
his
finger
-
ends
is
at
home
everywhere
;
and
we
must
make
a
new
start
.
<EOS>
My
mother
wo
n't
stand
in
the
way
,
for
she
's
told
me
,
since
I
came
home
,
she
'd
made
up
her
mind
to
being
buried
in
another
parish
,
if
I
wished
it
,
and
if
I
'd
be
more
comfortable
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
It
's
wonderful
how
quiet
she
's
been
ever
since
I
came
back
.
<EOS>
It
seems
as
if
the
very
greatness
<EOS>
o
'
the
trouble
had
quieted
and
calmed
her
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
be
better
in
a
new
country
,
though
there
's
some
I
shall
be
loath
to
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
part
from
you
and
yours
,
if
I
can
help
it
,
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
Trouble
's
made
us
kin
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
lad
,
"
said
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
go
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
hearing
o
'
<EOS>
that
man
's
name
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
we
shall
ne'er
go
far
enough
for
folks
not
to
find
out
as
we
've
got
them
belonging
to
us
as
are
transported
<EOS>
o'er
the
seas
,
and
were
like
to
be
hanged
.
<EOS>
We
shall
have
that
flyin
'
up
in
our
faces
,
and
our
children
's
after
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
a
long
visit
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
drew
too
strongly
on
Adam
's
energies
for
him
to
think
of
seeing
others
,
or
re
-
entering
on
his
old
occupations
till
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
But
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
I
'll
go
to
work
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
learn
to
like
it
again
some
time
,
maybe
;
and
it
's
right
whether
I
like
it
or
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
evening
was
the
last
he
would
allow
to
be
absorbed
by
sorrow
:
<EOS>
suspense
was
gone
now
,
and
he
must
bear
the
unalterable
.
<EOS>
He
was
resolved
not
to
see
Arthur
Donnithorne
again
,
if
it
were
possible
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
message
to
deliver
from
Hetty
now
,
for
Hetty
had
seen
Arthur
.
<EOS>
And
Adam
distrusted
himself
 
he
had
learned
to
dread
the
violence
of
his
own
feeling
.
<EOS>
That
word
of
Mr.
Irwine
's
 
that
he
must
remember
what
he
had
felt
after
giving
the
last
blow
to
Arthur
in
the
Grove
 
had
remained
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
These
thoughts
about
Arthur
,
like
all
thoughts
that
are
charged
with
strong
feeling
,
were
continually
recurring
,
and
they
always
called
up
the
image
of
the
Grove
 
of
that
spot
under
the
overarching
boughs
where
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
two
bending
figures
,
and
had
been
possessed
by
sudden
rage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
and
see
it
again
to
-
night
for
the
last
time
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
'll
do
me
good
;
it
'll
make
me
feel
over
again
what
I
felt
when
I
'd
knocked
him
down
.
<EOS>
I
felt
what
poor
empty
work
it
was
,
as
soon
as
I
'd
done
it
,
before
I
began
to
think
he
might
be
dead
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
this
way
it
happened
that
Arthur
and
Adam
were
walking
towards
the
same
spot
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
on
his
working
-
dress
again
,
now
,
for
he
had
thrown
off
the
other
with
a
sense
of
relief
as
soon
as
he
came
home
;
and
if
he
had
had
the
basket
of
tools
over
his
shoulder
,
he
might
have
been
taken
,
with
his
pale
wasted
face
,
for
the
spectre
of
the
Adam
Bede
who
entered
the
Grove
on
that
August
evening
eight
months
ago
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
no
basket
of
tools
,
and
he
was
not
walking
with
the
old
erectness
,
looking
<EOS>
keenly
round
him
;
his
hands
were
thrust
in
his
side
pockets
,
and
his
eyes
rested
chiefly
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
long
entered
the
Grove
,
and
now
he
paused
before
a
beech
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
tree
well
;
it
was
the
boundary
mark
of
his
youth
 
<EOS>
the
sign
,
to
him
,
of
the
time
when
some
of
his
earliest
,
strongest
feelings
had
left
him
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
they
would
never
return
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
at
this
moment
,
there
was
a
stirring
of
affection
at
the
remembrance
of
that
Arthur
Donnithorne
whom
he
had
believed
in
before
he
had
come
up
to
this
beech
eight
months
ago
.
<EOS>
It
was
affection
for
the
dead
:
THAT
Arthur
existed
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
disturbed
by
the
sound
of
approaching
footsteps
,
but
the
beech
stood
at
a
turning
in
the
road
,
and
he
could
not
see
who
was
coming
until
the
tall
slim
figure
in
deep
mourning
suddenly
stood
before
him
at
only
two
yards
'
distance
.
<EOS>
They
both
started
,
and
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Often
,
in
the
last
fortnight
,
Adam
had
imagined
himself
as
close
to
Arthur
as
this
,
assailing
him
with
words
that
should
be
as
harrowing
as
the
voice
of
remorse
,
forcing
upon
him
a
just
share
in
the
misery
he
had
caused
;
and
often
,
too
,
he
had
told
himself
that
such
a
meeting
had
better
not
be
.
<EOS>
But
in
imagining
the
meeting
he
had
always
seen
Arthur
,
as
he
had
met
him
on
that
evening
in
the
Grove
,
florid
,
careless
,
light
of
speech
;
and
the
figure
before
him
touched
him
with
the
signs
of
suffering
.
<EOS>
Adam
knew
what
suffering
was
 
<EOS>
he
could
not
lay
a
cruel
finger
on
a
bruised
man
.
<EOS>
He
felt
no
impulse
that
he
needed
to
resist
.
<EOS>
Silence
was
more
just
than
reproach
.
<EOS>
Arthur
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
"
he
said
,
quietly
,
"
it
may
be
a
good
thing
that
we
have
met
here
,
for
I
wished
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
asked
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
but
Adam
said
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
it
is
painful
to
you
to
meet
me
,
"
Arthur
went
on
,
"
but
it
is
not
likely
to
happen
again
for
years
to
come
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
No
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
coldly
,
"
that
was
what
I
meant
to
write
to
you
to
-
morrow
,
as
it
would
be
better
all
dealings
should
be
at
an
end
between
us
,
and
somebody
else
put
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
felt
the
answer
keenly
,
and
it
was
not
without
an
effort
that
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
partly
on
that
subject
I
wished
to
speak
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
lessen
your
indignation
against
me
,
or
ask
you
to
do
anything
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
I
only
wish
to
ask
you
if
you
will
help
me
to
lessen
the
evil
consequences
of
the
past
,
which
is
unchangeable
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
consequences
to
myself
,
but
to
others
.
<EOS>
It
is
but
<EOS>
little
I
can
do
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
I
know
the
worst
consequences
will
remain
;
but
something
may
be
done
,
and
you
can
help
me
.
<EOS>
Will
you
listen
to
me
patiently
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
after
some
hesitation
;
"
I
'll
hear
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
help
to
mend
anything
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
Anger
'
ull
mend
nothing
<EOS>
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
We
've
had
enough
o
'
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
going
to
the
Hermitage
,
"
said
Arthur
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
go
there
with
me
and
sit
down
?
<EOS>
We
can
talk
better
there
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Hermitage
had
never
been
entered
since
they
left
it
together
,
for
Arthur
had
locked
up
the
key
in
his
desk
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
when
he
opened
the
door
,
there
was
the
candle
burnt
out
in
the
socket
;
there
was
the
chair
in
the
same
place
where
Adam
remembered
sitting
;
there
was
the
waste
-
paper
basket
full
of
scraps
,
and
deep
down
in
it
,
Arthur
felt
in
an
instant
,
there
was
the
little
pink
silk
handkerchief
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
painful
to
enter
this
place
if
their
previous
thoughts
had
been
less
painful
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
down
opposite
each
other
in
the
old
places
,
and
Arthur
said
,
"
I
'm
going
away
,
Adam
;
I
'm
going
into
the
army
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Arthur
felt
that
Adam
ought
to
be
affected
by
this
announcement
 
ought
to
have
a
movement
of
sympathy
towards
him
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
's
lips
remained
firmly
closed
,
and
the
expression
of
his
face
unchanged
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
I
want
to
say
to
you
,
"
Arthur
continued
,
"
is
this
:
one
of
my
reasons
for
going
away
is
that
no
one
else
may
leave
Hayslope
 
may
leave
their
home
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
I
would
do
anything
,
there
is
no
sacrifice
I
would
not
make
,
to
prevent
any
further
injury
to
others
through
my
 
through
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
's
words
had
precisely
the
opposite
effect
to
that
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Adam
thought
he
perceived
in
them
that
notion
of
compensation
for
irretrievable
wrong
,
that
self
-
soothing
attempt
to
make
evil
bear
the
same
fruits
as
good
,
which
most
of
all
roused
his
indignation
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
strongly
impelled
to
look
painful
facts
right
in
the
face
as
Arthur
was
to
turn
away
his
eyes
from
them
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
the
wakeful
suspicious
pride
of
a
poor
man
in
the
presence
of
a
rich
man
.
<EOS>
He
felt
his
old
severity
returning
as
he
said
,
"
The
time
's
past
for
that
,
sir
.
<EOS>
A
man
should
make
sacrifices
to
keep
clear
of
doing
a
wrong
;
sacrifices
wo
n't
undo
it
when
it
's
done
.
<EOS>
When
people
's
feelings
have
got
a
deadly
wound
,
they
ca
n't
be
cured
with
favours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Favours
!
"
said
Arthur
,
passionately
;
"
no
<EOS>
;
how
can
you
suppose
I
meant
that
?
<EOS>
But
the
Poysers
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
tells
me
the
Poysers
mean
to
leave
the
place
where
they
have
lived
so
many
years
 
for
generations
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
,
as
Mr.
Irwine
does
,
that
if
they
could
be
persuaded
to
overcome
the
feeling
that
drives
them
away
,
it
would
be
much
better
for
them
in
the
end
to
remain
on
the
old
spot
,
among
the
friends
and
neighbours
who
know
them
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
true
,
"
said
Adam
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
then
,
sir
,
folks
's
feelings
are
not
so
easily
overcome
.
<EOS>
It
'll
be
hard
for
Martin
Poyser
to
go
to
a
strange
place
,
among
strange
faces
,
when
he
's
been
bred
up
on
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
his
father
before
him
;
but
then
it
'
ud
be
harder
for
a
man
with
his
feelings
to
stay
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see
how
the
thing
's
to
be
made
any
other
than
hard
.
<EOS>
There
's
a
sort
o
'
damage
,
sir
,
that
ca
n't
be
made
up
for
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
was
silent
some
moments
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
other
feelings
dominant
in
him
this
evening
,
his
pride
winced
under
Adam
's
mode
of
treating
him
.
<EOS>
Was
n't
he
himself
suffering
?
<EOS>
Was
not
he
too
obliged
to
renounce
his
most
cherished
hopes
?
<EOS>
It
was
now
as
it
had
been
eight
months
ago
 
Adam
was
forcing
Arthur
to
feel
more
intensely
the
irrevocableness
of
his
own
wrong
-
doing
.
<EOS>
He
was
presenting
the
sort
of
resistance
that
was
the
most
irritating
to
Arthur
's
eager
ardent
nature
.
<EOS>
But
his
anger
was
subdued
by
the
same
influence
that
had
subdued
Adam
's
when
they
first
confronted
each
other
 
by
the
marks
of
suffering
in
a
long
familiar
face
.
<EOS>
The
momentary
struggle
ended
in
the
feeling
that
he
could
bear
a
great
deal
from
Adam
,
to
whom
he
had
been
the
occasion
of
bearing
so
much
;
but
there
was
a
touch
of
pleading
,
boyish
vexation
in
his
tone
as
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
But
people
may
make
injuries
worse
by
unreasonable
conduct
 
by
giving
way
to
anger
and
satisfying
that
for
the
moment
,
instead
of
thinking
what
will
be
the
effect
in
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
were
going
to
stay
here
and
act
as
landlord
,
"
he
added
presently
,
with
still
more
eagerness
 
"
if
I
were
careless
about
what
I
've
done
 
<EOS>
what
I
've
been
the
cause
of
,
you
would
have
some
excuse
,
Adam
,
for
going
away
and
encouraging
others
to
go
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
some
excuse
then
for
trying
to
make
the
evil
worse
.
<EOS>
But
when
I
tell
you
I
'm
going
away
for
years
 
<EOS>
when
you
know
what
that
means
for
me
,
how
it
cuts
off
every
plan
of
happiness
<EOS>
I
've
ever
formed
 
<EOS>
it
is
impossible
for
a
sensible
man
like
you
to
believe
that
there
is
any
real
ground
for
the
Poysers
refusing
to
remain
.
<EOS>
I
know
their
feeling
about
disgrace
 
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
has
told
me
all
;
but
he
is
of
opinion
that
they
might
be
persuaded
out
of
this
idea
that
they
are
disgraced
in
the
eyes
of
their
neighbours
,
and
that
they
ca
n't
remain
on
my
estate
,
if
you
would
join
him
in
his
efforts
 
if
you
would
stay
yourself
and
go
on
managing
the
old
woods
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
paused
a
moment
and
then
added
,
pleadingly
,
"
You
know
that
's
a
good
work
to
do
for
the
sake
of
other
people
,
besides
the
owner
.
<EOS>
And
you
do
n't
know
but
that
they
may
have
a
better
owner
soon
,
whom
you
will
like
to
work
for
.
<EOS>
If
I
die
,
my
cousin
Tradgett
will
have
the
estate
and
take
my
name
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
good
fellow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
could
not
help
being
moved
:
it
was
impossible
for
him
not
to
feel
that
this
was
the
voice
of
the
honest
warm
-
hearted
Arthur
whom
he
had
loved
and
been
proud
of
in
old
days
;
but
nearer
memories
would
not
be
thrust
away
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
;
yet
Arthur
saw
an
answer
in
his
face
that
induced
him
to
go
on
,
with
growing
earnestness
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
then
,
if
you
would
talk
to
the
Poysers
 
if
you
would
talk
the
matter
over
with
Mr.
Irwine
 
<EOS>
he
means
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
and
then
if
you
would
join
your
arguments
to
his
to
prevail
on
them
not
to
go
....
<EOS>
I
know
,
of
course
,
that
they
would
not
accept
any
favour
from
me
 
<EOS>
I
mean
nothing
of
that
kind
 
<EOS>
but
I
'm
sure
they
would
suffer
less
in
the
end
.
<EOS>
Irwine
thinks
so
too
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Irwine
is
to
have
the
chief
authority
on
the
estate
 
he
has
consented
to
undertake
that
.
<EOS>
They
will
really
be
under
no
man
but
one
whom
they
respect
and
like
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
the
same
with
you
,
Adam
,
and
it
could
be
nothing
but
a
desire
to
give
me
worse
pain
that
could
incline
you
to
go
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
was
silent
again
for
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
with
some
agitation
in
his
voice
,
"
I
would
n't
act
so
towards
you
,
I
know
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
in
my
place
and
I
in
yours
,
I
should
try
to
help
you
to
do
the
best
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
made
a
hasty
movement
on
his
chair
and
looked
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Arthur
went
on
,
"
Perhaps
you
've
never
done
anything
you
've
had
bitterly
to
repent
of
in
your
life
,
Adam
;
if
you
had
,
you
would
be
more
generous
.
<EOS>
You
would
know
then
that
it
's
worse
for
me
than
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arthur
rose
from
his
seat
with
the
last
words
,
and
went
to
one
of
the
windows
,
looking
out
and
turning
his
back
on
Adam
,
as
he
continued
,
passionately
,
"
Have
n't
I
loved
her
too
?
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
see
her
yesterday
?
<EOS>
Sha
n't
I
carry
the
thought
of
her
about
with
me
as
much
as
you
will
?
<EOS>
And
do
n't
you
think
you
would
suffer
more
if
you
'd
been
in
fault
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
for
several
minutes
,
for
the
struggle
in
Adam
's
mind
was
not
easily
decided
.
<EOS>
Facile
natures
,
whose
emotions
have
little
permanence
,
can
hardly
understand
how
much
inward
resistance
he
overcame
before
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
turned
towards
Arthur
.
<EOS>
Arthur
heard
the
movement
,
and
turning
round
,
met
the
sad
but
softened
look
with
which
Adam
said
,
"
It
's
true
what
you
say
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
'm
hard
 
<EOS>
it
's
in
my
nature
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
hard
with
my
father
,
for
doing
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
've
been
a
bit
hard
t
'
everybody
but
her
.
<EOS>
I
felt
as
if
nobody
pitied
her
enough
 
<EOS>
her
suffering
cut
into
me
so
;
and
<EOS>
when
I
thought
the
folks
at
the
farm
were
too
hard
with
her
,
I
said
I
'd
never
be
hard
to
anybody
myself
again
.
<EOS>
But
feeling
overmuch
about
her
has
perhaps
made
me
unfair
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
've
known
what
it
is
in
my
life
to
repent
and
feel
it
's
too
late
.
<EOS>
I
felt
I
'd
been
too
harsh
to
my
father
when
he
was
gone
from
me
 
<EOS>
I
feel
it
now
,
when
I
think
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
right
to
be
hard
towards
them
as
have
done
wrong
and
repent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
spoke
these
words
with
the
firm
distinctness
of
a
man
who
is
resolved
to
leave
nothing
unsaid
that
he
is
bound
to
say
;
but
he
went
on
with
more
hesitation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
shake
hands
with
you
once
,
sir
,
when
you
asked
me
 
<EOS>
but
if
you
're
willing
to
do
it
now
,
for
all
I
refused
then
...
"
  
Arthur
's
white
hand
was
in
Adam
's
large
grasp
in
an
instant
,
and
with
that
action
there
was
a
strong
rush
,
on
both
sides
,
of
the
old
,
boyish
affection
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
"
Arthur
said
,
impelled
to
full
confession
now
,
"
it
would
never
have
happened
if
I
'd
known
you
loved
her
.
<EOS>
That
would
have
helped
to
save
me
from
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
did
struggle
.
<EOS>
I
never
meant
to
injure
her
.
<EOS>
I
deceived
you
afterwards
 
and
that
led
on
to
worse
;
but
I
thought
it
was
forced
upon
me
<EOS>
,
I
thought
it
was
the
best
thing
I
could
do
.
<EOS>
And
in
that
letter
I
told
her
to
let
me
know
if
she
were
in
any
trouble
:
do
n't
think
I
would
not
have
done
everything
I
could
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
all
wrong
from
the
very
first
,
and
horrible
wrong
has
come
of
it
.
<EOS>
God
knows
,
I
'd
give
my
life
if
I
could
undo
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
sat
down
again
opposite
each
other
,
and
Adam
said
,
tremulously
,
"
How
did
she
seem
when
you
left
her
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Do
n't
ask
me
,
Adam
,
"
Arthur
said
;
"
I
feel
sometimes
as
if
I
should
go
mad
with
thinking
of
her
looks
and
what
she
said
to
me
,
and
then
,
that
I
could
n't
get
a
full
pardon
 
that
I
could
n't
save
her
from
that
wretched
fate
of
being
transported
 
that
I
can
do
nothing
for
her
all
those
years
;
and
she
may
die
under
it
,
and
never
know
comfort
any
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
sir
,
"
said
Adam
,
for
the
first
time
feeling
his
own
pain
merged
in
sympathy
for
Arthur
,
"
you
and
me'll
often
be
thinking
o
'
the
same
thing
,
when
we
're
a
long
way
off
one
another
.
<EOS>
I
'll
pray
God
to
help
you
,
as
I
pray
him
to
help
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
there
's
that
sweet
woman
 
<EOS>
that
Dinah
Morris
,
"
Arthur
said
,
pursuing
his
own
thoughts
and
not
knowing
what
had
been
the
sense
of
Adam
's
words
,
"
she
says
she
shall
stay
with
her
to
the
very
last
moment
 
till
she
goes
;
and
the
poor
thing
clings
to
her
as
if
she
found
some
comfort
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
could
worship
that
woman
;
I
do
n't
know
what
I
should
do
if
she
were
not
there
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
you
will
see
her
when
she
comes
back
.
<EOS>
I
could
say
nothing
to
her
yesterday
 
nothing
of
what
I
felt
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Tell
her
,
"
Arthur
went
on
hurriedly
,
as
if
he
wanted
to
hide
the
emotion
with
which
he
spoke
,
while
he
took
off
his
chain
and
watch
,
"
<EOS>
tell
her
I
asked
you
to
give
her
this
in
remembrance
of
me
 
of
the
man
to
whom
she
is
the
one
source
of
comfort
,
when
he
thinks
of
...
<EOS>
I
know
she
does
n't
care
about
such
things
 
or
anything
else
<EOS>
I
can
give
her
for
its
own
sake
.
<EOS>
But
she
will
use
the
watch
 
I
shall
like
to
think
of
her
using
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
give
it
to
her
,
sir
,
"
Adam
said
,
"
and
tell
her
your
words
.
<EOS>
She
told
me
she
should
come
back
to
the
people
at
the
Hall
Farm
.
"
  
"
And
you
will
persuade
the
Poysers
to
stay
,
Adam
?
"
said
Arthur
,
reminded
of
the
subject
which
both
of
them
had
forgotten
in
the
first
interchange
of
revived
friendship
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
stay
yourself
,
and
help
Mr.
Irwine
to
carry
out
the
repairs
and
improvements
on
the
estate
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
one
thing
,
sir
,
that
perhaps
you
do
n't
take
account
of
,
"
said
Adam
,
with
hesitating
gentleness
,
"
and
that
was
what
made
me
hang
back
longer
.
<EOS>
You
see
,
it
's
the
same
with
both
me
and
the
Poysers
:
if
we
stay
,
it
's
for
our
own
worldly
interest
,
and
it
looks
as
if
we
'd
put
up
with
anything
for
<EOS>
the
sake
o
'
that
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
's
what
they
'll
feel
,
and
I
ca
n't
help
feeling
a
little
of
it
myself
.
<EOS>
When
folks
have
got
an
honourable
independent
spirit
,
they
do
n't
like
to
do
anything
that
might
make
'em
seem
base
-
minded
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
no
one
who
knows
you
will
think
that
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
That
is
not
a
reason
strong
enough
against
a
course
that
is
really
more
generous
,
more
unselfish
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
And
it
will
be
known
 
it
shall
be
made
known
,
that
both
you
and
the
Poysers
stayed
at
my
entreaty
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
do
n't
try
to
make
things
worse
for
me
;
I
'm
punished
enough
without
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
no
,
"
Adam
said
,
looking
at
Arthur
with
mournful
affection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
make
things
worse
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
used
to
wish
I
could
do
it
,
in
my
passion
 
<EOS>
but
that
was
when
I
thought
you
did
n't
feel
enough
.
<EOS>
I
'll
stay
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
'll
do
the
best
I
can
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
I
've
got
to
think
of
now
 
to
do
my
work
well
and
make
the
world
a
bit
better
place
for
them
as
can
enjoy
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
part
now
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
You
will
see
Mr.
Irwine
to
-
morrow
,
and
consult
with
him
about
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
soon
,
sir
?
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
possible
 
after
I
've
made
the
necessary
arrangements
.
<EOS>
Good
-
bye
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
of
you
going
about
the
old
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
bye
,
sir
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
hands
were
clasped
once
more
,
and
Adam
left
the
Hermitage
,
feeling
that
sorrow
was
more
bearable
now
hatred
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
him
,
Arthur
went
to
the
waste
-
paper
basket
and
took
out
the
little
pink
silk
handkerchief
.
      
<EOS>
At
the
Hall
Farm
  
THE
first
autumnal
afternoon
sunshine
of
1801
 
more
than
eighteen
months
after
that
parting
of
Adam
and
Arthur
in
the
Hermitage
 
was
on
the
yard
at
the
Hall
Farm
;
and
the
bull
-
dog
was
in
one
of
his
most
excited
moments
,
for
it
was
that
hour
of
the
day
when
the
cows
were
being
driven
into
the
yard
for
their
afternoon
milking
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
the
patient
beasts
ran
confusedly
into
the
wrong
places
,
for
the
alarming
din
of
the
bull
-
dog
was
mingled
with
more
distant
sounds
which
the
timid
feminine
creatures
,
with
pardonable
superstition
,
imagined
also
to
have
some
relation
to
their
own
movements
 
with
the
tremendous
crack
of
the
waggoner
's
whip
,
the
roar
of
his
voice
,
and
the
booming
thunder
of
the
waggon
,
as
it
left
the
rick
-
yard
empty
of
its
golden
load
.
  
<EOS>
The
milking
of
the
cows
was
a
sight
Mrs.
Poyser
loved
,
and
at
this
hour
on
mild
days
she
was
usually
standing
at
the
house
door
,
with
her
knitting
in
her
hands
,
in
quiet
contemplation
,
only
heightened
to
a
keener
interest
when
the
vicious
yellow
cow
,
who
had
once
kicked
over
a
pailful
of
precious
milk
,
was
about
to
undergo
the
preventive
punishment
of
having
her
hinder
-
legs
strapped
.
  
<EOS>
To
-
day
,
however
,
Mrs.
Poyser
gave
but
a
divided
attention
to
the
arrival
of
the
cows
,
for
she
was
in
eager
discussion
with
Dinah
,
who
was
stitching
Mr.
Poyser
's
shirt
-
collars
,
and
had
borne
patiently
to
have
her
thread
broken
three
times
by
Totty
pulling
at
her
arm
with
a
sudden
insistence
that
she
should
look
at
"
Baby
,
"
that
is
,
at
a
large
wooden
doll
with
no
legs
and
a
long
skirt
,
whose
bald
head
Totty
,
seated
in
her
small
chair
at
Dinah
's
side
,
was
caressing
and
pressing
to
her
fat
cheek
with
much
fervour
.
<EOS>
Totty
is
larger
by
more
than
two
years
'
growth
than
when
you
first
saw
her
,
and
she
has
on
a
black
frock
under
her
pinafore
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
too
has
on
a
black
gown
,
which
seems
to
heighten
the
family
likeness
between
her
and
Dinah
.
<EOS>
In
other
respects
there
is
little
outward
change
now
discernible
in
our
old
friends
,
or
in
the
pleasant
house
-
place
,
bright
with
polished
oak
and
pewter
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
saw
the
like
to
you
,
Dinah
,
"
Mrs.
Poyser
was
saying
,
"
when
you
've
once
took
anything
into
your
head
:
there
's
no
more
moving
you
than
the
rooted
tree
.
<EOS>
You
may
say
what
you
like
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
that
's
religion
;
for
what
's
the
Sermon
on
the
Mount
about
,
as
you
're
<EOS>
so
fond
o
'
reading
to
the
boys
,
but
doing
what
other
folks
'
ud
have
you
do
?
<EOS>
But
if
it
was
anything
unreasonable
they
wanted
you
to
do
,
like
taking
your
cloak
off
and
giving
it
to
'em
,
or
letting
'em
slap
you
<EOS>
i
'
the
face
<EOS>
,
I
daresay
you
'd
be
ready
enough
.
<EOS>
It
's
only
when
one

ud
<EOS>
have
you
do
what
's
plain
common
sense
and
good
for
yourself

you
're
obstinate
th
'
other
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
dear
Aunt
,
"
said
Dinah
,
smiling
slightly
as
she
went
on
with
her
work
,
"
I
'm
sure
your
wish
'
ud
be
a
reason
for
me
to

anything

Dear
Aunt
Rachel
,
"
said
Dinah
,
looking
up
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
face
,
"
it
's
your
kindness
<EOS>
makes
you
say
I
'm
useful
to
you

<EOS>
You
do
n't
really
want
me
now

for
Nancy

Molly
are
clever
at
their
work

and
you
're
in
good
health
now

by
the
blessing

you

at

I

You

Yes

said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
returning
from
a
parenthetic
glance
at
the
cows
,
<EOS>
"
that

the

There
was
a
certain
something
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
voice
just
then
,
which
she
did
not
wish
to
be
noticed
,
so
she
turned
round
hastily
to
look
at
the
clock
,
and
said
:
"
See

you
go
out

<EOS>
Totty
trotted
off
in
her
flapping
bonnet
,
while
Mrs.
Poyser
set
out
the
bright
oak
table
and
reached
down
the
tea

cups

,
if
you
're
gone

<EOS>
An
'
there
's
that
blessed
child
 
<EOS>
something
's
sure
t
'
happen
to
her
 
<EOS>
they
'll
let
her
tumble
into
the
fire
,
or
get
at
the
kettle
wi
'
the
boiling
lard
in't

or
some
mischief
as
'
ull
lame
her
for
life

an

it
'll
be
all
your
fault
,
Dinah

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
Aunt
,
"
said
Dinah
,
"
I
promise
to
come
back
to
you
in
the
winter
if
you
're
ill
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
think
I
will
ever
stay
away
from
you
if
you
're
in
real
want
of
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
indeed
,
it
is
needful
for
my
own
soul
that
I
should
go
away
from
this
life
of
ease
and
luxury
in
which
I
have
all
things
too
richly
to
enjoy
 
at
least
that
I
should
go
away
for
a
short
space
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
know
but
myself
what
are
my
inward
needs
,
and
the
besetments
I
am
most
in
danger
from
.
<EOS>
Your
wish
for
me
to
stay
is
not
a
call
of
duty
which
I
refuse
to
hearken
to
because
it
is
against
my
own
desires
;
it
is
a
temptation
that
I
must
resist
,
lest
the
love
of
the
creature
should
become
like
a
mist
in
my
soul
shutting
out
the
heavenly
light
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
passes
my
cunning
to
know
what
you
mean
by
ease
and
luxury
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
as
she
cut
the
bread
and
butter
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
true
there
's
good
victual
enough
about
you
,
as
nobody
shall
ever
say
I
do
n't
provide
enough
and
to
spare
,
but
if
there
's
ever
a
bit
o
'
odds
an
'
ends
as
nobody
else
'
ud
eat
,
you
're
sure
to
pick
it
out
...
<EOS>
but
look
there
!
<EOS>
There
's
Adam
Bede
a
-
carrying
the
little
un
in
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
how
it
is
he
's
come
so
early
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
hastened
to
the
door
for
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
her
darling
in
a
new
position
,
with
love
in
her
eyes
but
reproof
on
her
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
for
shame
,
Totty
!
<EOS>
Little
gells
o
'
five
year
old
should
be
ashamed
to
be
carried
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Adam
,
she
'll
break
your
arm
,
such
a
big
gell
as
that
;
set
her
down
 
for
shame
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
can
lift
her
with
my
hand
 
<EOS>
I
've
no
need
to
take
my
arm
to
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Totty
,
looking
as
serenely
unconscious
of
remark
as
a
fat
white
puppy
,
was
set
down
at
the
door
-
place
,
and
the
mother
enforced
her
reproof
with
a
shower
of
kisses
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
surprised
to
see
me
at
this
hour
o
'
<EOS>
the
day
,
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
but
come
in
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
making
way
for
him
;
"
there
's
no
bad
news
<EOS>
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
nothing
bad
,
"
Adam
answered
,
as
he
went
up
to
Dinah
and
put
out
his
hand
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
had
laid
down
her
work
and
stood
up
,
instinctively
,
as
he
approached
her
.
<EOS>
A
faint
blush
died
away
from
her
pale
cheek
as
she
put
her
hand
in
his
and
looked
up
at
him
timidly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
an
errand
to
<EOS>
you
brought
me
,
Dinah
,
"
said
Adam
,
apparently
unconscious
that
he
was
holding
her
hand
all
the
while
;
<EOS>
"
mother
's
a
bit
ailing
,
and
she
's
set
her
heart
on
your
coming
to
stay
the
night
with
her
,
if
you
'll
be
so
kind
.
<EOS>
I
told
her
I
'd
call
and
ask
you
as
I
came
from
the
village
.
<EOS>
She
overworks
herself
,
and
I
ca
n't
persuade
her
to
have
a
little
girl
t

help
her
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
what
's
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
released
Dinah
's
hand
as
he
ceased
speaking
,
and
was
expecting
an
answer
,
but
before
she
had
opened
her
lips
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
said
,
"
Look
there
now
!
<EOS>
I
told
you
there

folks

There

Mrs.

as
can
be

and
she
wo

The

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
put
my

on
and
set
off
directly
,
if
you
do
n't
want
anything
done

Aunt

said
Dinah
,
folding
up
her
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes

I
do
want
something
done

<EOS>
I
want

<EOS>

Yes

then
I
'll
walk
with
Dinah

<EOS>
I
'm
going
straight

I

a
lot

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Adam
,
lad
,
are
you
here
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
entering
warm
and
coatless
,
with
the
two
black
-
eyed
boys
behind
him
,
still
looking
as
much
like
him
as
two
small
elephants
are
like
a
large
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
is
it
<EOS>
we
've
got
sight
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
you
so
long
before
foddering
-
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
came
on
an
errand
for
Mother
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
got
a
touch
of
her
old
complaint
,
and
she
wants
Dinah
to
go
and
stay
with
her
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
we
'll
spare
her
for
your
mother
a
little
while
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
wonna
spare
her
for
anybody
else
,
on'y
her
husband
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Husband
!
<EOS>
"
said
Marty
,
who
was
at
the
most
prosaic
and
literal
period
of
the
boyish
mind
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Dinah
has
n't
got
a
husband
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Spare
her
?
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
placing
a
seed
-
cake
on
the
table
and
then
seating
herself
to
pour
out
the
tea
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
spare
her
,
it
seems
,
and
not
for
a
husband
neither
,
but
for
her
own
megrims
.
<EOS>
Tommy
,
what
are
you
doing
to
your
little
sister
's
doll
?
<EOS>
Making
the
child
naughty
,
when
she
'd
be
good
if
you
'd
let
her
.
<EOS>
You
shanna
have
a
morsel
<EOS>
o
'
cake
if
you
behave
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Tommy
,
with
true
brotherly
sympathy
,
was
amusing
himself
by
turning
Dolly
's
skirt
over
her
bald
head
and
exhibiting
her
truncated
body
to
the
general
scorn
 
<EOS>
an
indignity
which
cut
Totty
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
think
Dinah
's
been
<EOS>
a
-
telling
me
since
dinner
-
time
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
continued
,
looking
at
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
!
<EOS>
I
'm
a
poor
un
at
guessing
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
she
means
to
go
back
to
Snowfield
again
,
and
work
i
'
the
mill
,
and
starve
herself
,
as
she
used
to
do
,
like
a
creatur
as
has
got
no
friends
.
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
did
not
readily
find
words
to
express
his
unpleasant
astonishment
;
he
only
looked
from
his
wife
to
Dinah
,
who
had
now
seated
herself
beside
Totty
,
as
a
bulwark
against
brotherly
playfulness
,
and
was
busying
herself
with
the
children
's
tea
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
been
given
to
making
general
reflections
,
it
would
have
occurred
to
him
that
there
was
certainly
a
change
come
over
Dinah
,
for
she
never
used
to
change
colour
;
but
,
as
it
was
,
he
merely
observed
that
her
face
was
flushed
at
that
moment
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
thought
she
looked
the
prettier
for
it
:
it
was
a
flush
no
deeper
than
the
petal
of
a
monthly
rose
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
came
because
her
uncle
was
looking
at
her
so
fixedly
;
but
there
is
no
knowing
,
for
just
then
Adam
was
saying
,
with
quiet
surprise
,
"
Why
,
I
hoped
Dinah
was
settled
among
us
for
life
.
<EOS>
I
thought
she
'd
given
up
the
notion
o
'
going
back
to
her
old
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thought
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
and
so
would
anybody
else
ha
'
thought
,
as
had
got
their
right
end
up'ards
.
<EOS>
But
I
suppose
you
must
be
a
Methodist
to
know
what
a
Methodist
'
ull
do
.
<EOS>
It
's
ill
guessing
what
the
bats
are
flying
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
what
have
we
done
to
you
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
as
you
must
go
away
from
us
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
still
pausing
over
his
tea
-
cup
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
breaking
your
word
,
welly
,
for
your
aunt
never
had
no
thought
<EOS>
but
you
'd
make
this
your
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Uncle
,
"
said
Dinah
,
trying
to
be
quite
calm
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
first
came
,
I
said
it
was
only
for
a
time
,
as
long
as
I
could
be
of
any
comfort
to
my
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
an
'
who
said
you
'd
ever
left
off
being
a
comfort
to
me
?
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
didna
mean
to
stay
wi
'
me
,
you
'd
better
never
ha
'
come
.
<EOS>
Them
as
ha
'
never
had
a
cushion
do
n't
miss
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
nay
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
who
objected
to
exaggerated
views
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee
mustna
say
so
;
we
should
ha
'
been
ill
off
wi'out
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
,
Lady
day
was
a
twelvemont
'
.
<EOS>
We
mun
be
thankful
for
that
,
whether
she
stays
or
no
.
<EOS>
But
I
canna
think
what
she
mun
leave
a
good
home
for
,
to
go
back
int
'
a
country
where
the
land
,
most
on't
,
isna
worth
ten
shillings
an
acre
,
rent
and
profits
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
's
just
the
reason
she
wants
to
go
,
as
fur
as
she
can
give
a
reason
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
says
this
country
's
too
comfortable
,
an
'
there
's
too
much
t
'
eat
,
<EOS>
an
'
folks
arena
miserable
enough
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
going
next
week
.
<EOS>
I
canna
turn
her
,
say
what
I
will
.
<EOS>
It
's
allays
the
way
wi
'
them
meek
-
faced
people
;
you
may
's
well
pelt
<EOS>
a
bag
o
'
feathers
as
talk
to
'em
.
<EOS>
But
I
say
it
isna
religion
,
to
be
so
obstinate
 
<EOS>
is
it
now
,
Adam
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
saw
that
Dinah
was
more
disturbed
than
he
had
ever
seen
her
by
any
matter
relating
to
herself
,
and
,
anxious
to
relieve
her
,
if
possible
,
he
said
,
looking
at
her
affectionately
,
"
Nay
,
I
ca
n't
find
fault
with
anything
Dinah
does
.
<EOS>
I
believe
her
thoughts
are
better
than
our
guesses
,
let
'em
be
what
they
may
.
<EOS>
I
should
ha
'
been
thankful
for
her
to
stay
among
us
,
but
if
she
thinks
well
to
go
,
I
would
n't
cross
her
,
or
make
it
hard
to
her
by
objecting
.
<EOS>
We
owe
her
something
different
to
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
it
often
happens
,
the
words
intended
to
relieve
her
were
just
too
much
for
Dinah
's
susceptible
feelings
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
The
tears
came
into
the
grey
eyes
too
fast
to
be
hidden
<EOS>
and
she
got
up
hurriedly
,
meaning
it
to
be
understood
that
she
was
going
to
put
on
her
bonnet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
what
's
Dinah
crying
for
?
"
said
Totty
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
n't
a
naughty
dell
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thee'st
gone
a
bit
too
fur
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
no
right
t
'
interfere
with
her
doing
as
she
likes
.
<EOS>
An
'
thee'dst
be
as
angry
as
could
be
wi
'
me
,
if
I
said
a
word
against
anything
she
did
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
you
'd
very
like
be
finding
fault
wi'out
reason
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
reason
<EOS>
i
'
<EOS>
what
I
say
,
else
I
shouldna
say
it
.
<EOS>
It
's
easy
talking
for
them
as
ca
n't
love
her
so
well
as
her
own
aunt
does
.
<EOS>
An
'
me
got
so
used
to
her
!
<EOS>
I
shall
feel
as
uneasy
as
a
new
sheared
sheep
when
she
's
gone
from
me
.
<EOS>
An
'
to
think
of
her
leaving
a
parish
where
she
's
so
looked
on
.
<EOS>
There
's
Mr.
Irwine
makes
as
much
of
her
as
if
she
was
a
lady
,
for
all
her
being
a
Methodist
,
an
'
wi
'
that
maggot
o
'
preaching
in
her
head
 
God
forgi'e
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
if
I
'm
i
'
the
wrong
to
call
it
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
looking
jocose
;
"
but
thee
dostna
tell
Adam
what
he
said
to
thee
about
it
one
day
.
<EOS>
The
missis
was
saying
,
Adam
,
as
the
preaching
was
the
only
fault
to
be
found
wi
'
Dinah
,
and
Mr.
Irwine
says
,
"
But
you
must
n't
find
fault
with
her
for
that
<EOS>
,
Mrs.
Poyser
;
you
forget
she
's
got
no
husband
to
preach
to
.
<EOS>
I
'll
answer
for
it
,
you
give
Poyser
many
a
good
sermon
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
parson
had
thee
there
,
"
Mr.
Poyser
added
,
laughing
unctuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
Bartle
Massey
on
it
,
an
'
he
laughed
too
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
it
's
a
small
joke
sets
men
laughing
when
they
sit
a
-
staring
at
one
another
with
a
pipe
<EOS>
i
'
their
mouths
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Give
Bartle
Massey
his
way
and
he
'd
have
all
the
sharpness
to
himself
.
<EOS>
If
the
chaff
-
cutter
had
the
making
of
us
,
we
should
all
be
straw
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
Totty
,
my
chicken
,
go
upstairs
to
cousin
Dinah
,
and
see
what
she
's
doing
,
and
give
her
a
pretty
kiss
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
errand
was
devised
for
Totty
as
a
means
of
checking
certain
threatening
symptoms
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
;
for
Tommy
,
no
longer
expectant
of
cake
,
was
lifting
up
his
eyelids
with
his
forefingers
and
turning
his
eyeballs
towards
Totty
in
a
way
that
she
felt
to
be
disagreeably
personal
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
rare
and
busy
now
 
eh
,
Adam
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Burge
's
getting
so
bad
wi
'
his
asthmy
,
it
's
well
if
he
'll
ever
do
much
riding
about
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
we
've
got
a
pretty
bit
o
'
building
on
hand
now
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
<EOS>
what
with
the
repairs
on
th
'
estate
,
and
the
new
houses
at
Treddles'on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
bet
a
penny
that
new
house
Burge
is
building
on
his
own
bit
o
'
land
is
for
him
and
Mary
to
go
to
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
be
for
laying
by
business
soon
,
I
'll
warrant
,
and
be
wanting
you
to
take
to
it
all
and
pay
him
so
much
by
th

'
ear
.
<EOS>
We
shall
see
you
living
on
th
'
hill
before
another
twelvemont
's
over
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
should
like
t
'
have
the
business
in
my
own
hands
.
<EOS>
It
is
n't
as
I
mind
much
about
getting
any
more
money
.
<EOS>
We
've
enough
and
to
spare
now
,
with
only
our
two
selves
and
mother
;
but
I
should
like
t
'
have
my
own
way
about
things
 
<EOS>
I
could
try
plans
then
,
as
I
ca
n't
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
get
on
pretty
well
<EOS>
wi
'
the
new
steward
,
I
reckon
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
he
's
a
sensible
man
enough
;
understands
farming
 
<EOS>
he
's
carrying
on
the
draining
,
and
all
that
,
capital
.
<EOS>
You
must
go
some
day
towards
the
Stonyshire
side
and
see
what
alterations
they
're
making
.
<EOS>
But
he
's
got
no
notion
about
buildings
.
<EOS>
You
can
so
seldom
get
hold
of
a
man
as
can
turn
his
brains
to
more
nor
one
thing
;
it
's
just
as
if
they
wore
blinkers
like
th
'
horses
and
could
see
nothing
o
'
one
side
of
'em
.
<EOS>
Now
,
there
's
Mr.
Irwine
has
got
<EOS>
notions
o
'
building
more
nor
most
architects
;
for
as
for
th
'
architects
,
they
set
up
to
be
fine
fellows
,
but
the
most
of
'em
do
n't
know
where
to
set
a
chimney
so
as
it
sha
n't
be
quarrelling
with
a
door
.
<EOS>
My
notion
is
,
a
practical
builder
that
's
got
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
taste
makes
the
best
architect
for
common
things
;
and
I
've
ten
times
the
pleasure
<EOS>
i
'
seeing
after
the
work
when
I
've
made
the
plan
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
listened
with
an
admiring
interest
to
Adam
's
discourse
on
building
,
but
perhaps
it
suggested
to
him
that
the
building
of
his
corn
-
rick
had
been
proceeding
a
little
too
long
without
the
control
of
the
master
's
eye
,
for
when
Adam
had
done
speaking
,
he
got
up
and
said
,
"
Well
,
lad
,
I
'll
bid
you
good
-
bye
now
,
for
I
'm
off
to
the
rick
-
yard
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
rose
too
,
for
he
saw
Dinah
entering
,
with
her
bonnet
on
and
a
little
basket
in
her
hand
,
preceded
by
Totty
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
ready
,
I
see
,
Dinah
,
"
Adam
said
;
"
so
we
'll
set
off
,
for
the
sooner
I
'm
at
home
the
better
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
said
Totty
,
with
her
treble
pipe
,
"
Dinah
was
saying
her
prayers
and
crying
ever
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
,
hush
,
"
said
the
mother
,
"
little
gells
must
n't
chatter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Whereupon
the
father
,
shaking
with
silent
laughter
,
set
Totty
on
the
white
deal
table
and
desired
her
to
kiss
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
,
you
perceive
,
had
no
correct
principles
of
education
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
back
to
-
morrow
if
Mrs.
Bede
does
n't
want
you
,
Dinah
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
:
"
<EOS>
but
you
can
stay
,
you
know
,
if
she
's
ill
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
when
the
good
-
byes
had
been
said
,
Dinah
and
Adam
left
the
Hall
Farm
together
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
Cottage
  
ADAM
did
not
ask
Dinah
to
take
his
arm
when
they
got
out
into
the
lane
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
yet
done
so
,
often
as
they
had
walked
together
,
for
he
had
observed
that
she
never
walked
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
Seth
,
and
he
thought
,
perhaps
,
that
kind
of
support
was
not
agreeable
to
her
.
<EOS>
So
they
walked
apart
,
though
side
by
side
,
and
the
close
poke
of
her
little
black
bonnet
hid
her
face
from
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
ca
n't
be
happy
,
then
,
to
make
the
Hall
Farm
your
home
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
said
,
with
the
quiet
interest
of
a
brother
,
who
has
no
anxiety
for
himself
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
,
seeing
they
're
so
fond
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
,
Adam
,
my
heart
is
as
their
heart
,
so
far
as
love
for
them
and
care
for
their
welfare
goes
,
but
they
are
in
no
present
need
.
<EOS>
Their
sorrows
are
healed
,
and
I
feel
that
I
am
called
back
to
my
old
work
,
in
which
I
found
a
blessing
that
I
have
missed
of
late
in
the
midst
of
too
abundant
worldly
good
.
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
a
vain
thought
to
flee
from
the
work
that
God
appoints
us
,
for
the
sake
of
finding
a
greater
blessing
to
our
own
souls
,
as
if
we
could
choose
for
ourselves
where
we
shall
find
the
fulness
of
the
Divine
Presence
,
instead
of
seeking
it
where
alone
it
is
to
be
found
,
in
loving
obedience
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
I
believe
,
I
have
a
clear
showing
that
my
work
lies
elsewhere
 
at
least
for
a
time
.
<EOS>
In
the
years
to
come
,
if
my
aunt
's
health
should
fail
,
or
she
should
otherwise
need
me
,
I
shall
return
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
best
,
Dinah
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
believe
you
'd
go
against
the
wishes
of
them
that
love
you
,
and
are
akin
to
you
,
without
a
good
and
sufficient
reason
in
your
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
right
to
say
anything
about
my
being
sorry
<EOS>
:
you
know
well
enough
<EOS>
what
cause
I
have
to
put
you
above
every
other
friend
I
've
got
;
and
if
it
had
been
ordered
so
that
you
could
ha
'
been
my
sister
,
and
lived
with
us
all
our
lives
,
I
should
ha
'
counted
it
the
greatest
blessing
as
could
happen
to
us
now
.
<EOS>
But
Seth
tells
me
there
's
no
hope
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
that
:
your
feelings
are
different
,
and
perhaps
I
'm
taking
too
much
upon
me
to
speak
about
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
made
no
answer
,
and
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
yards
,
till
they
came
to
the
stone
stile
,
where
,
as
Adam
had
passed
through
first
and
turned
round
to
give
her
his
hand
while
she
mounted
the
unusually
high
step
,
she
could
not
prevent
him
from
seeing
her
face
.
<EOS>
It
struck
him
with
surprise
,
for
the
grey
eyes
,
usually
so
mild
and
grave
,
had
the
bright
uneasy
glance
which
accompanies
suppressed
agitation
,
and
the
slight
flush
in
her
cheeks
,
with
which
she
had
come
downstairs
,
was
heightened
to
a
deep
rose
-
colour
.
<EOS>
She
looked
as
if
she
were
only
sister
to
Dinah
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
silent
with
surprise
and
conjecture
for
some
moments
,
and
then
he
said
,
"
I
hope
I
've
not
hurt
or
displeased
you
by
what
I
've
said
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
was
making
too
free
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
wish
different
from
what
you
see
to
be
best
,
and
I
'm
satisfied
for
you
to
live
thirty
mile
off
,
if
you
think
it
right
.
<EOS>
I
shall
think
of
you
just
as
much
as
I
do
now
,
for
you
're
bound
up
with
what
I
can
no
more
help
remembering
than
I
can
help
my
heart
beating
.
"
  
<EOS>
Poor
Adam
!
<EOS>
Thus
do
men
blunder
.
<EOS>
Dinah
made
no
answer
,
but
she
presently
said
,
"
Have
you
heard
any
news
from
that
poor
young
man
,
since
we
last
spoke
of
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
always
called
Arthur
so
;
she
had
never
lost
the
image
of
him
as
she
had
seen
him
in
the
prison
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Adam
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
read
me
part
of
a
letter
from
him
yesterday
.
<EOS>
It
's
pretty
certain
,
they
say
,
that
there
'll
be
a
peace
soon
,
though
nobody
believes
it
'll
last
long
;
but
he
says
he
does
n't
mean
to
come
home
.
<EOS>
He
's
no
heart
for
it
yet
,
and
it
's
better
for
others
that
he
should
keep
away
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
thinks
he
's
in
the
right
not
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
sorrowful
letter
.
<EOS>
He
asks
about
you
and
the
Poysers
,
as
he
always
does
.
<EOS>
There
's
one
thing
in
the
letter
cut
me
a
good
deal
:
"
You
ca
n't
think
what
an
old
fellow
I
feel
,
"
he
says
;
"
I
make
no
schemes
now
.
<EOS>
I
'm
the
best
when
I
've
a
good
day
's
march
or
fighting
before
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
's
of
a
rash
,
warm
-
hearted
nature
,
like
Esau
,
for
whom
I
have
always
felt
great
pity
,
"
said
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
meeting
between
the
brothers
,
where
Esau
is
so
loving
and
generous
,
and
Jacob
so
timid
and
distrustful
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
his
sense
of
the
Divine
favour
,
has
always
touched
me
greatly
.
<EOS>
Truly
,
I
have
been
tempted
sometimes
to
say
that
Jacob
was
of
a
mean
spirit
.
<EOS>
But
that
is
our
trial
:
we
must
learn
to
see
the
good
in
the
midst
of
much
that
is
unlovely
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
like
to
read
about
Moses
best
,
in
th
'
Old
Testament
.
<EOS>
He
carried
a
hard
business
well
through
,
and
died
when
other
folks
were
going
to
reap
the
fruits
.
<EOS>
A
man
must
have
courage
to
look
at
his
life
so
,
and
think
what
'll
come
of
it
after
he
's
dead
and
gone
.
<EOS>
A
good
solid
bit
o
'
work
lasts
:
if
it
's
only
laying
a
floor
down
,
somebody
's
the
better
for
it
being
done
well
,
besides
the
man
as
does
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
were
both
glad
to
talk
of
subjects
that
were
not
personal
,
and
in
this
way
they
went
on
till
they
passed
the
bridge
across
the
Willow
Brook
,
when
Adam
turned
round
and
said
,
"
Ah
,
here
's
Seth
.
<EOS>
I
thought
he
'd
be
home
soon
.
<EOS>
Does
he
know
of
you
're
going
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
told
him
last
Sabbath
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
remembered
now
that
Seth
had
come
home
much
depressed
on
Sunday
evening
,
a
circumstance
which
had
been
very
unusual
with
him
of
late
,
for
the
happiness
he
had
in
seeing
Dinah
every
week
seemed
long
to
have
outweighed
the
pain
of
knowing
she
would
never
marry
him
.
<EOS>
This
evening
he
had
his
habitual
air
of
dreamy
benignant
contentment
,
until
he
came
quite
close
to
Dinah
and
saw
the
traces
of
tears
on
her
delicate
eyelids
and
eyelashes
.
<EOS>
He
gave
one
rapid
glance
at
his
brother
,
but
Adam
was
evidently
quite
outside
the
current
of
emotion
that
had
shaken
Dinah
:
he
wore
his
everyday
look
of
unexpectant
calm
.
<EOS>
Seth
tried
not
to
let
Dinah
see
that
he
had
noticed
her
face
,
and
only
said
,
"
I
'm
thankful
you
're
come
,
Dinah
,
for
Mother
's
been
hungering
after
the
sight
of
you
all
day
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
talk
of
you
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
.
"
  
<EOS>
When
they
entered
the
cottage
,
Lisbeth
was
seated
in
her
arm
-
chair
,
too
tired
with
setting
out
the
evening
meal
,
a
task
she
always
performed
a
long
time
beforehand
,
to
go
and
meet
them
at
the
door
as
usual
,
when
she
heard
the
approaching
footsteps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Coom
,
child
,
thee't
coom
at
last
,
"
she
said
,
when
Dinah
went
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
dost

"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
friend
,

said
Dinah
,
taking
her
hand
,
"
you
're
not
well
.

"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
was
moving
away
,
but
Lisbeth
held
her
fast
,
while
she
was
taking
off
her
bonnet
,
and
looked
at
her
face
as
one
looks
into
a
newly
gathered
snowdrop
,
to
renew
the
old
impressions
of
purity
and
gentleness
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
's
the
matter
wi
'
thee
?
"
said
Lisbeth
,
in
astonishment
;
"
thee'st
been
a
-
cryin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
only
a
grief
that
'll
pass
away
,
"
said
Dinah
,
who
did
not
wish
just
now
to
call
forth
Lisbeth
's
remonstrances
by
disclosing
her
intention
to
leave
Hayslope
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
know
about
it
shortly
 
we
'll
talk
of
it
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
shall
stay
with
you
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
was
pacified
by
this
prospect
.
<EOS>
And
she
had
the
whole
evening
to
talk
with
Dinah
alone
;
for
there
was
a
new
room
in
the
cottage
,
you
remember
,
built
nearly
two
years
ago
,
in
the
expectation
of
a
new
inmate
;
and
here
Adam
always
sat
when
he
had
writing
to
do
or
plans
to
make
.
<EOS>
Seth
sat
there
too
this
evening
,
for
he
knew
his
mother
would
like
to
have
Dinah
all
to
herself
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
pretty
pictures
on
the
two
sides
of
the
wall
in
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
there
was
the
broad
-
shouldered
,
large
-
featured
,
hardy
old
woman
,
in
her
blue
jacket
and
buff
kerchief
,
with
her
dim
-
eyed
anxious
looks
turned
continually
on
the
lily
face
and
the
slight
form
in
the
black
dress
that
were
either
moving
lightly
about
in
helpful
activity
,
or
seated
close
by
the
old
woman
's
arm
-
chair
,
holding
her
withered
hand
,
with
eyes
lifted
up
towards
her
to
speak
a
language
which
Lisbeth
understood
far
better
than
the
Bible
or
the
hymn
-
book
.
<EOS>
She
would
scarcely
listen
to
reading
at
all
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
nay
,
shut
the
book
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
mun
talk
.
<EOS>
I
want
t
'
know
what
thee
was
cryin
'
about
.
<EOS>
Hast
got
troubles
o
'
thy
own
,
like
other
folks
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
wall
there
were
the
two
brothers
so
like
each
other
in
the
midst
of
their
unlikeness
:
<EOS>
Adam
with
knit
brows
,
shaggy
hair
,
and
dark
vigorous
colour
,
absorbed
in
his
"
figuring
"
;
<EOS>
Seth
,
with
large
rugged
features
,
the
close
copy
of
his
brother
's
,
but
with
thin
,
wavy
,
brown
hair
and
blue
dreamy
eyes
,
as
often
as
not
looking
vaguely
out
of
the
window
instead
of
at
his
book
,
although
it
was
a
newly
bought
book
 
Wesley
's
abridgment
of
Madame
Guyon
's
life
,
which
was
full
of
wonder
and
interest
for
him
.
<EOS>
Seth
had
said
to
Adam
,
"
Can
I
help
thee
with
anything
in
here
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
to
make
a
noise
in
the
shop
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
lad
,
"
Adam
answered
,
"
there
's
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
I
must
do
myself
.
<EOS>
Thee'st
got
thy
new
book
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
often
,
when
Seth
was
quite
unconscious
,
Adam
,
as
he
paused
after
drawing
a
line
with
his
ruler
,
looked
at
his
brother
with
a
kind
smile
dawning
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
knew
"
th
'
lad
liked
to
sit
full
o
'
thoughts
he
could
give
no
account
of
;
they
'd
never
come
t
'
anything
,
but
they
made
him
happy
,
"
and
in
the
last
year
or
so
,
Adam
had
been
getting
more
and
more
indulgent
to
Seth
.
<EOS>
It
was
part
of
that
growing
tenderness
which
came
from
the
sorrow
at
work
within
him
.
  
<EOS>
For
Adam
,
though
you
see
him
quite
master
of
himself
,
working
hard
and
delighting
in
his
work
after
his
inborn
inalienable
nature
,
had
not
outlived
his
sorrow
 
had
not
felt
it
slip
from
him
as
a
temporary
burden
,
and
leave
him
the
same
man
again
.
<EOS>
Do
any
of
us
?
<EOS>
God
forbid
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
poor
result
of
all
our
anguish
and
our
wrestling
if
we
won
nothing
but
our
old
selves
at
the
end
of
it
 
if
we
could
return
to
the
same
blind
loves
,
the
same
self
-
confident
blame
,
the
same
light
thoughts
of
human
suffering
,
the
same
frivolous
gossip
over
blighted
human
lives
,
the
same
feeble
sense
of
that
Unknown
towards
which
we
have
sent
forth
irrepressible
cries
in
our
loneliness
.
<EOS>
Let
us
rather
be
thankful
that
our
sorrow
lives
in
us
as
an
indestructible
force
,
only
changing
its
form
,
as
forces
do
,
and
passing
from
pain
into
sympathy
 
the
one
poor
word
which
includes
all
our
best
insight
and
our
best
love
.
<EOS>
Not
that
this
transformation
of
pain
into
sympathy
had
completely
taken
place
in
Adam
yet
.
<EOS>
There
was
still
a
great
remnant
of
pain
,
and
this
he
felt
would
subsist
as
long
as
her
pain
was
not
a
memory
,
but
an
existing
thing
,
which
he
must
think
of
as
renewed
with
the
light
of
every
new
morning
.
<EOS>
But
we
get
accustomed
to
mental
as
well
as
bodily
pain
,
without
,
for
all
that
,
losing
our
sensibility
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
becomes
a
habit
of
our
lives
,
and
we
cease
to
imagine
a
condition
of
perfect
ease
as
possible
for
us
.
<EOS>
Desire
is
chastened
into
submission
,
and
we
are
contented
with
our
day
when
we
have
been
able
to
bear
our
grief
in
silence
and
act
as
if
we
were
not
suffering
.
<EOS>
For
it
is
at
such
periods
that
the
sense
of
our
lives
having
visible
and
invisible
relations
,
beyond
any
of
which
either
our
present
or
prospective
self
is
the
centre
,
grows
like
a
muscle
that
we
are
obliged
to
lean
on
and
exert
.
  
<EOS>
That
was
Adam
's
state
of
mind
in
this
second
autumn
of
his
sorrow
.
<EOS>
His
work
,
as
you
know
,
had
always
been
part
of
his
religion
,
and
from
very
early
days
he
saw
clearly
that
good
carpentry
was
God
's
will
 
<EOS>
was
that
form
of
God
's
will
that
most
immediately
concerned
him
.
<EOS>
But
now
there
was
no
margin
of
dreams
for
him
beyond
this
daylight
reality
,
no
holiday
-
time
in
the
working
-
day
world
,
no
moment
in
the
distance
when
duty
would
take
off
her
iron
glove
and
breast
-
plate
and
clasp
him
gently
into
rest
.
<EOS>
He
conceived
no
picture
of
the
future
but
one
made
up
of
hard
-
working
days
such
as
he
lived
through
,
with
growing
contentment
and
intensity
of
interest
,
every
fresh
week
.
<EOS>
Love
,
he
thought
,
could
never
be
anything
to
him
but
a
living
memory
 
a
limb
lopped
off
,
but
not
gone
from
consciousness
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
that
the
power
of
loving
was
all
the
while
gaining
new
force
within
him
;
that
the
new
sensibilities
bought
by
a
deep
experience
were
so
many
new
fibres
by
which
it
was
possible
,
nay
,
necessary
to
him
,
that
his
nature
should
intertwine
with
another
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
aware
that
common
affection
and
friendship
were
more
precious
to
him
than
they
used
to
be
 
that
he
clung
more
to
his
mother
and
Seth
,
and
had
an
unspeakable
satisfaction
in
the
sight
or
imagination
of
any
small
addition
to
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
Poysers
,
too
 
hardly
three
or
four
days
passed
but
he
felt
the
need
of
seeing
them
and
interchanging
words
and
looks
of
friendliness
with
them
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
felt
this
,
probably
,
even
if
Dinah
had
not
been
with
them
,
but
he
had
only
said
the
simplest
truth
in
telling
Dinah
that
he
put
her
above
all
other
friends
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Could
anything
be
more
natural
?
<EOS>
For
in
the
darkest
moments
of
memory
the
thought
of
her
always
came
as
the
first
ray
of
returning
comfort
.
<EOS>
The
early
days
of
gloom
at
the
Hall
Farm
had
been
gradually
turned
into
soft
moonlight
by
her
presence
;
and
in
the
cottage
,
too
,
for
she
had
come
at
every
spare
moment
to
soothe
and
cheer
poor
Lisbeth
,
who
had
been
stricken
with
a
fear
that
subdued
even
her
querulousness
at
the
sight
of
her
darling
Adam
's
grief
-
worn
face
.
<EOS>
He
had
become
used
to
watching
her
light
quiet
movements
,
her
pretty
loving
ways
to
the
children
,
when
he
went
to
the
Hall
Farm
;
to
listen
for
her
voice
as
for
a
recurrent
music
;
to
think
everything
she
said
and
did
was
just
right
,
and
could
not
have
been
better
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
wisdom
,
he
could
not
find
fault
with
her
for
her
overindulgence
of
the
children
,
who
had
managed
to
convert
Dinah
the
preacher
,
before
whom
a
circle
of
rough
men
had
often
trembled
a
little
,
into
a
convenient
household
slave
 
though
Dinah
herself
was
rather
ashamed
of
this
weakness
,
and
had
some
inward
conflict
as
to
her
departure
from
the
precepts
of
Solomon
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
there
was
one
thing
that
might
have
been
better
;
she
might
have
loved
Seth
and
consented
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
He
felt
a
little
vexed
,
for
his
brother
's
sake
,
and
he
could
not
help
thinking
regretfully
how
Dinah
,
as
Seth
's
wife
,
would
have
made
their
home
as
happy
as
it
could
be
for
them
all
 
how
she
was
the
one
being
that
would
have
soothed
their
mother
's
last
days
into
peacefulness
and
rest
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
<EOS>
she
does
n't
love
th
'
lad
,
"
Adam
had
said
sometimes
to
himself
,
"
for
anybody
'
ud
think
he
was
just
cut
out
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
her
heart
's
so
taken
up
with
other
things
.
<EOS>
She
's
<EOS>
one
o
'
those
women
that
feel
no
drawing
towards
having
a
husband
and
children
o
'
their
own
.
<EOS>
She
thinks
she
should
be
filled
up
with
her
own
life
then
,
and
she
's
been
used
so
to
living
in
other
folks
's
cares
,
she
ca
n't
bear
the
thought
of
her
heart
being
shut
up
from
'em
.
<EOS>
I
see
how
it
is
,
well
enough
.
<EOS>
She
's
cut
out
o
'
different
stuff
from
most
women
<EOS>
:
I
saw
that
long
ago
.
<EOS>
She
's
never
easy
<EOS>
but
when
she
's
helping
somebody
,
and
marriage
'
ud
interfere
with
her
ways
 
that
's
true
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
right
to
be
contriving
and
thinking
it
'
ud
be
better
if
she
'd
have
Seth
,
as
if
I
was
wiser
than
she
is
 
or
than
God
either
,
for
He
made
her
what
she
is
,
and
that
's
one
o
'
<EOS>
the
greatest
blessings
I
've
ever
had
from
His
hands
,
and
others
besides
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
self
-
reproof
had
recurred
strongly
to
Adam
's
mind
when
he
gathered
from
Dinah
's
face
that
he
had
wounded
her
by
referring
to
his
wish
that
she
had
accepted
Seth
,
and
so
he
had
endeavoured
to
put
into
the
strongest
words
his
confidence
in
her
decision
as
right
 
his
resignation
even
to
her
going
away
from
them
and
ceasing
to
make
part
of
their
life
otherwise
than
by
living
in
their
thoughts
,
if
that
separation
were
chosen
by
herself
.
<EOS>
He
felt
sure
she
knew
quite
well
enough
how
much
he
cared
to
see
her
continually
 
to
talk
to
her
with
the
silent
consciousness
of
a
mutual
great
remembrance
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
possible
she
should
hear
anything
but
self
-
renouncing
affection
and
respect
in
his
assurance
that
he
was
contented
for
her
to
go
away
;
and
yet
there
remained
an
uneasy
feeling
in
his
mind
that
he
had
not
said
quite
the
right
thing
 
<EOS>
that
,
somehow
,
Dinah
had
not
understood
him
.
  
<EOS>
Dinah
must
have
risen
a
little
before
the
sun
the
next
morning
,
for
she
was
downstairs
about
five
o'clock
.
<EOS>
So
was
Seth
,
for
,
through
Lisbeth
's
obstinate
refusal
to
have
any
woman
-
helper
in
the
house
,
he
had
learned
to
make
himself
,
as
Adam
said
,
"
very
handy
in
the
housework
,
"
that
he
might
save
his
mother
from
too
great
weariness
;
on
which
ground
I
hope
you
will
not
think
him
unmanly
,
any
more
than
you
can
have
thought
the
gallant
Colonel
Bath
unmanly
when
he
made
the
gruel
for
his
invalid
sister
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
who
had
sat
up
late
at
his
writing
,
was
still
asleep
,
and
was
not
likely
,
Seth
said
,
to
be
down
till
breakfast
-
time
.
<EOS>
Often
as
Dinah
had
visited
Lisbeth
during
the
last
eighteen
months
,
she
had
never
slept
in
the
cottage
since
that
night
after
Thias
's
death
,
when
,
you
remember
,
Lisbeth
praised
her
deft
movements
and
even
gave
a
modified
approval
to
her
porridge
.
<EOS>
But
in
that
long
interval
Dinah
had
made
great
advances
in
household
cleverness
,
and
<EOS>
this
morning
,
since
Seth
was
there
to
help
,
she
was
bent
on
bringing
everything
to
a
pitch
of
cleanliness
and
order
that
would
have
satisfied
her
Aunt
Poyser
.
<EOS>
The
cottage
was
far
from
that
standard
at
present
,
for
Lisbeth
's
rheumatism
had
forced
her
to
give
up
her
old
habits
of
dilettante
scouring
and
polishing
.
<EOS>
When
the
kitchen
was
to
her
mind
,
Dinah
went
into
the
new
room
,
where
Adam
had
been
writing
the
night
before
,
to
see
what
sweeping
and
dusting
were
needed
there
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
window
and
let
in
the
fresh
morning
air
,
and
the
smell
of
the
sweet
-
brier
,
and
the
bright
low
-
slanting
rays
of
the
early
sun
,
which
made
a
glory
about
her
pale
face
and
pale
auburn
hair
as
she
held
the
long
brush
,
and
swept
,
singing
to
herself
in
a
very
low
tone
 
like
a
sweet
summer
murmur
that
you
have
to
listen
for
very
closely
 
one
of
Charles
Wesley
's
hymns
:
       
Eternal
Beam
of
Light
Divine
,
     
Fountain
of
unexhausted
love
,
     
<EOS>
In
whom
the
Father
's
glories
shine
,
     
Through
earth
beneath
and
heaven
above
;
       
Jesus
!
<EOS>
the
weary
wanderer
's
rest
<EOS>
,
     
Give
me
thy
easy
yoke
to
bear
;
     
<EOS>
With
steadfast
patience
arm
my
breast
,
     
With
spotless
love
and
holy
fear
.
       
<EOS>
Speak
to
my
warring
passions
,
"
Peace
!
"
     
<EOS>
Say
to
my
trembling
heart
,
"
Be
still
!
"
     
<EOS>
Thy
power
<EOS>
my
strength
and
fortress
is
,
     
<EOS>
For
all
things
serve
thy
sovereign
will
.
  
<EOS>
She
laid
by
the
brush
and
took
up
the
duster
;
and
if
you
had
ever
lived
in
Mrs.
Poyser
's
household
,
you
would
know
how
the
duster
behaved
in
Dinah
's
hand
 
how
it
went
into
every
small
corner
,
and
on
every
ledge
in
and
out
of
sight
 
<EOS>
how
it
went
again
and
again
round
every
bar
of
the
chairs
,
and
every
leg
,
and
under
and
over
everything
that
lay
on
the
table
,
till
it
came
to
Adam
's
papers
and
rulers
and
the
open
desk
near
them
.
<EOS>
Dinah
dusted
up
to
the
very
edge
of
these
and
then
hesitated
,
looking
at
them
with
a
longing
but
timid
eye
.
<EOS>
It
was
painful
to
see
how
much
dust
there
was
among
them
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
looking
in
this
way
,
she
heard
Seth
's
step
just
outside
the
open
door
,
towards
which
her
back
was
turned
,
and
said
,
raising
her
clear
treble
,
"
Seth
,
is
your
brother
wrathful
when
his
papers
are
stirred
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
very
,
when
they
are
not
put
back
in
the
right
places
,
"
said
a
deep
strong
voice
,
not
Seth
's
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
Dinah
had
put
her
hands
<EOS>
unawares
on
a
vibrating
chord
.
<EOS>
She
was
shaken
with
an
intense
thrill
,
and
for
the
instant
felt
nothing
else
;
then
she
knew
her
cheeks
were
glowing
,
and
dared
not
look
round
,
but
stood
still
,
distressed
because
she
could
not
say
good
-
morning
in
a
friendly
way
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
finding
that
she
did
not
look
round
so
as
to
see
the
smile
on
his
face
,
was
afraid
she
had
thought
him
serious
about
his
wrathfulness
,
and
went
up
to
her
,
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
look
at
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
You
think
I
'm
a
cross
fellow
at
home
,
Dinah
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
smilingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
Dinah
,
looking
up
with
timid
eyes
,
"
not
so
.
<EOS>
But
you
might
be
put
about
by
finding
things
meddled
with
;
and
even
the
man
Moses
,
the
meekest
of
men
,
was
wrathful
sometimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
,
then
,
"
said
Adam
,
looking
at
her
affectionately
,
"
I
'll
help
you
move
the
things
,
and
put
'em
back
again
,
and
then
they
ca
n't
get
wrong
.
<EOS>
You
're
getting
to
be
your
aunt
's
own
niece
,
I
see
,
for
particularness
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
began
their
little
task
together
,
but
Dinah
had
not
recovered
herself
sufficiently
to
think
of
any
remark
,
and
Adam
looked
at
her
uneasily
.
<EOS>
Dinah
,
he
thought
,
had
seemed
to
disapprove
him
somehow
lately
;
she
had
not
been
so
kind
and
open
to
him
as
she
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
He
wanted
her
to
look
at
him
,
and
be
as
pleased
as
he
was
himself
with
doing
this
bit
of
playful
work
.
<EOS>
But
Dinah
did
not
look
at
him
 
<EOS>
it
was
easy
for
her
to
avoid
looking
at
the
tall
man
 
and
when
at
last
there
was
no
more
dusting
to
be
done
and
no
further
excuse
for
him
to
linger
near
her
,
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
,
and
said
,
in
rather
a
pleading
tone
,
"
Dinah
,
you
're
not
displeased
with
me
for
anything
,
are
you
?
<EOS>
I
've
not
said
or
done
anything
to
make
you
think
ill
of
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
question
surprised
her
,
and
relieved
her
by
giving
a
new
course
to
her
feeling
.
<EOS>
She
looked
up
at
him
now
,
quite
earnestly
,
almost
with
the
tears
coming
,
and
said
,
"
Oh
,
no
,
Adam
!
<EOS>
how
could
you
think
so
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
bear
you
not
to
feel
as
much
a
friend
to
me
as
I
do
to
you
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
do
n't
know
the
value
I
set
on
the
very
thought
of
you
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
That
was
what
I
meant
yesterday
,
when
I
said
I
'd
be
content
for
you
to
go
,
if
you
thought
right
.
<EOS>
I
meant
,
the
thought
of
you
was
worth
so
much
to
me
<EOS>
,
I
should
feel
I
ought
to
be
thankful
,
and
not
grumble
,
if
you
see
right
to
go
away
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
do
mind
parting
with
you
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
dear
friend
,
"
said
Dinah
,
trembling
,
but
trying
to
speak
calmly
,
"
I
know
you
have
a
brother
's
heart
towards
me
,
and
we
shall
often
be
with
one
another
in
spirit
;
<EOS>
but
at
this
season
I
am
in
heaviness
through
manifold
temptations
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
mark
me
.
<EOS>
I
feel
called
to
leave
my
kindred
for
a
while
;
but
it
is
a
trial
 
the
flesh
is
weak
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
saw
that
it
pained
her
to
be
obliged
to
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hurt
you
by
talking
about
it
,
Dinah
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
say
no
more
.
<EOS>
Let
's
see
if
Seth
's
ready
with
breakfast
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
is
a
simple
scene
,
reader
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
almost
certain
that
you
,
too
,
have
been
in
love
 
perhaps
,
even
,
more
than
once
,
though
you
may
not
choose
to
say
so
to
all
your
feminine
friends
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
you
will
no
more
think
the
slight
words
<EOS>
,
the
timid
looks
,
<EOS>
the
tremulous
touches
,
by
which
two
human
souls
approach
each
other
gradually
,
like
two
little
quivering
rain
-
streams
,
before
they
mingle
into
one
 
you
will
no
more
think
these
things
trivial
than
you
will
think
the
first
-
detected
signs
of
coming
spring
trivial
,
though
they
be
but
a
faint
indescribable
something
in
the
air
and
in
the
song
of
the
birds
,
and
the
tiniest
perceptible
budding
on
the
hedge
-
row
branches
.
<EOS>
Those
slight
words
and
looks
and
touches
are
part
of
the
soul
's
language
;
and
the
finest
language
,
I
believe
,
is
chiefly
made
up
of
unimposing
words
,
such
as
"
light
,
"
"
sound
,
"
"
stars
,
"
"
music
"
 
words
really
not
worth
looking
at
,
or
hearing
,
in
themselves
,
any
more
than
"
chips
"
or
"
sawdust
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
only
that
they
happen
to
be
the
signs
of
something
unspeakably
great
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
I
am
of
opinion
that
love
is
a
great
and
beautiful
thing
too
,
and
if
you
agree
with
me
,
the
smallest
signs
of
it
will
not
be
chips
and
sawdust
to
you
:
<EOS>
they
will
rather
be
like
those
little
words
,
"
light
"
and
"
music
,
"
stirring
the
long
-
winding
fibres
of
your
memory
and
enriching
your
present
with
your
most
precious
past
.

<EOS>
LISBETH
'S
<EOS>
touch
of
rheumatism
could
not
be
made
to
appear
serious
enough
to
detain
Dinah
another
night
from
the
Hall
Farm
,
now
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
leave
her
aunt
so
soon
,
and
at
evening
the
friends
must
part
.
"
<EOS>
For
a
long
while
,
"
Dinah
had
said
,
for
she
had
told
Lisbeth
of
her
resolve
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
it
'll
be
for
all
my
life
,
an
'
I
shall
ne'er
see
thee
again
,
"
said
Lisbeth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Long
while
!
<EOS>
I'n
got
no
long
while
t
'
live

<EOS>
An

<EOS>
I

an

I

a

longing
for
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
had
been
the
key
-
note
of
her
wailing
talk
all
day
;
for
Adam
was
not
in
the
house
,
and
so
she
put
no
restraint
on
her
complaining
.
<EOS>
She
had
tried
poor
Dinah
by
returning
again
and
again
to
the
question
,
why
she
must
go
away
;
and
refusing
to
accept
reasons
,
which
seemed
to
her
nothing
but
whim
and
"
contrairiness
"
;
and
still
more
,
by
regretting
that
she
"
couldna
'
ha
'
<EOS>
one
o
'
the
lads
"
and
be
her
daughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
couldstna
put
up
wi
'
Seth
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
He

enough

but
he
'd

been
very
good
t

thee
 
<EOS>
he

But

for

an

he
might
come
t

like
thee
<EOS>
well
enough
,
if
thee'dst
stop

<EOS>
But
he
's
as
stubborn
as
th
'
iron
bar
 
<EOS>
there
's
no
bending
him
no
way
<EOS>
but
's
own
.
<EOS>
But
he
'd
be
a
fine
husband
for
anybody

be

who
they

so
looked

on
an

so
cliver

"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
tried
to
escape
from
Lisbeth
's
closest
looks
and
questions
by
finding
little
tasks
of
housework
that
kept
her
moving
about
,
and
as
soon
as
Seth
came
home
in
the
evening
she
put
on
her
bonnet
to
go
.
<EOS>
It
touched
Dinah
keenly
to
say
the
last
good
-
bye
,
and
still
more
to
look
round
on
her
way
across
the
fields
and
see
the
old
woman
still
standing
at
the
door
,
gazing
after
her
till
she
must
have
been
the
faintest
speck
in
the
dim
aged
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
The
God
of
love
and
peace
be
with
them
,
"
Dinah
prayed
,
as
she
looked
back
from
the
last
stile
.
"
<EOS>
Make
them
glad
according
to
the
days
wherein
thou
hast
afflicted
them
,
and
the
years
wherein
they
have
seen
evil
.
<EOS>
It
is
thy
will
that
I
should
part
from
them
;
let
me
have
no
will
but
thine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
turned
into
the
house
at
last
and
sat
down
in
the
workshop
near
Seth
,
who
was
busying
himself
there
with
fitting
some
bits
of
turned
wood
he
had
brought
from
the
village
into
a
small
work
-
box
,
which
he
meant
to
give
to
Dinah
before
she
went
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee't

her
again
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
Sunday
afore

were
her

Seth
.

said
Lisbeth
,
with
a
burst
of
vexation
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
paused
a
moment
and
looked
up
,
with
a
slight
blush
,
at
his
mother
's
face
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
Has
she
said
anything

o

he
said
,
in
a
lower
tone

"
Said
?
<EOS>
Nay

she
'll

nothin'

Well

<EOS>
"
It

My

<EOS>
His
mother
's
suggestion
about
Dinah
's
feeling
towards
Adam
was
not
quite
a
new
thought
to
Seth
,
but
her
last
words
alarmed
him
,
lest
she
should
herself
undertake
to
open
Adam
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
sure
about
Dinah
's
feeling
,
and
he
thought
he
was
sure
about
Adam
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Mother
,
nay
,
"
he
said
,
earnestly
,
"
thee
mustna
think
o
'
speaking
o
'
such
things
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
Thee'st
no
right
to
say
what
Dinah
's
feelings
are
if
she
hasna
told
thee
,
and
it
'
ud
do
nothing
but
mischief
to
say
such
things
to
Adam
.
<EOS>
He
feels
very
grateful
and
affectionate
toward
Dinah
,
but
he
's
no
thoughts
towards
her
that
'
ud
incline
him
to
make
her
his
wife
,
and
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
Dinah
'
ud
marry
him
either
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
she
'll
marry
at
all
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
"
said
Lisbeth
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee
think'st
<EOS>
so
'cause
she
wouldna
ha
'
thee
.
<EOS>
She
'll
ne'er
marry
thee
;
thee
mightst
as
well
like
her
t
'
ha
'
thy
brother
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
hurt
.
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
remonstrating
tone
,
"
do
n't
think
that
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
as
thankful
t
'
have
her
for
a
sister
as
thee
wouldst
t
'
<EOS>
have
her
for
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
more
thoughts
about
myself
in
that
thing
,
and
I
shall
take
it
hard
if
ever
thee
say'st
it
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well

then
thee

cross
me

<EOS>
sayin
'
things

I

they
are

<EOS>
"
  
"
But
,
Mother
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
thee'dst
be
doing
Dinah
a
wrong
by
telling
Adam
what
thee
think'st
about
her
.
<EOS>
It
'
ud
do
nothing
but
mischief
,
for
it
'
ud
make
Adam
uneasy
if
he
doesna
feel
the
same
to
her
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
pretty
sure
he
feels
nothing
<EOS>
o
'
the
sort
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
donna
tell
me
what
thee't
<EOS>
sure
on
<EOS>
;
thee
know'st
nought
about
it
.
<EOS>
What
's
he
allays
goin'
to
the
Poysers
'
<EOS>
for
,
if
he
didna
want
t
'
see
her
?
<EOS>
He
goes
twice
where
he
used
t
'
go
once
.
<EOS>
Happen
he
knowsna
as
he
wants
t
'
see
her
;
he
knowsna
as
I
put
salt
in
<EOS>
's
broth
,
but
he
'd
miss
it
pretty
quick
if
it
warna
there
.
<EOS>
He
'll
ne'er
think
o
'
marrying
if
it
isna
put
into
's
head
,
an
'
if
thee'dst
any
love
for
thy
mother
,
thee'dst
put
him
up
<EOS>
to't
an
'
not

go
away
out
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
my

,
when
I
might
ha

her
to
make
a
bit
o
'
comfort
for
me
<EOS>
afore
<EOS>
I
go
to
bed
to
my
old
man
under
the
white
thorn
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
Mother
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
thee
mustna
think
me
unkind
,
but
I
should
be
going
against
my
conscience
if
I
took
upon
me
to
say
what
Dinah
's
feelings
are
.
<EOS>
And
besides
that
,
I
think
I
should
give
offence
to
Adam
by
speaking
to
him
at
all
about
marrying
;
and
I
counsel
thee
not
to
do't
.
<EOS>
Thee
may'st
be
quite
deceived
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
'm
pretty
sure
,
by
words
she
said
to
me
last
Sabbath
,
as
she
's
no
mind
to
marry
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
thee't
as
contrairy
as
the
rest
on
'em
.
<EOS>
If
it
war
summat
<EOS>
I
didna
want
,
it
'
ud
be
done
fast
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
rose
from
the
bench
at
this
,
and
went
out
of
the
workshop
,
leaving
Seth
in
much
anxiety
lest
she
should
disturb
Adam
's
mind
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
He
consoled
himself
after
a
time
with
reflecting
that
,
since
Adam
's
trouble
,
Lisbeth
had
been
very
timid
about
speaking
to
him
on
matters
of
feeling
,
and
that
she
would
hardly
dare
to
approach
this
tenderest
of
all
subjects
.
<EOS>
Even
if
she
did
,
he
hoped
Adam
would
not
take
much
notice
of
what
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
right
in
believing
that
Lisbeth
would
be
held
in
restraint
by
timidity
,
and
during
the
next
three
days
,
the
intervals
in
which
she
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
Adam
were
too
rare
and
short
to
cause
her
any
strong
temptation
.
<EOS>
But
in
her
long
solitary
hours
she
brooded
over
her
regretful
thoughts
about
Dinah
,
till
they
had
grown
very
near
that
point
of
unmanageable
strength
when
thoughts
are
apt
to
take
wing
out
of
their
secret
nest
in
a
startling
manner
.
<EOS>
And
on
Sunday
morning
,
when
Seth
went
away
to
chapel
at
Treddleston
,
the
dangerous
opportunity
came
.
  
<EOS>
Sunday
morning
was
the
happiest
time
in
all
the
week
to
Lisbeth
,
for
as
there
was
no
service
at
Hayslope
church
till
the
afternoon
,
Adam
was
always
at
home
,
doing
nothing
but
reading
,
an
occupation
in
which
she
could
venture
to
interrupt
him
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
she
had
always
a
better
dinner
than
usual
to
prepare
for
her
sons
 
very
frequently
for
Adam
and
herself
alone
,
Seth
being
often
away
the
entire
day
 
and
the
smell
of
the
roast
meat
before
the
clear
fire
in
the
clean
kitchen
,
<EOS>
the
clock
ticking
in
a
peaceful
Sunday
manner
,
her
darling
Adam
seated
near
her
in
his
best
clothes
,
doing
nothing
very
important
,
so
that
she
could
go
and
stroke
her
hand
across
his
hair
if
she
liked
,
and
see
him
look
up
at
her
and
smile
,
while
Gyp
,
rather
jealous
,
poked
his
muzzle
up
between
them
 
all
these
things
made
poor
Lisbeth
's
earthly
paradise
.
  
<EOS>
The
book
Adam
most
often
read
on
a
Sunday
morning
was
his
large
pictured
Bible
,
and
this
morning
it
lay
open
before
him
on
the
round
white
deal
table
in
the
kitchen
;
for
he
sat
there
in
spite
of
the
fire
,
because
he
knew
his
mother
liked
to
have
him
with
her
,
and
it
was
the
only
day
in
the
week
when
he
could
indulge
her
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
You
would
have
liked
to
see
Adam
reading
his
Bible
.
<EOS>
He
never
opened
it
on
a
weekday
,
and
so
he
came
to
it
as
a
holiday
book
,
serving
him
for
history
,
biography
,
and
poetry
.
<EOS>
He
held
one
hand
thrust
between
his
waistcoat
buttons
,
and
the
other
ready
to
turn
the
pages
,
and
in
the
course
of
the
morning
you
would
have
seen
many
changes
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
his
lips
moved
in
semi
-
articulation
 
<EOS>
it
was
when
he
came
to
a
speech
that
he
could
fancy
himself
uttering
,
such
as
Samuel
's
dying
speech
to
the
people
;
then
his
eyebrows
would
be
raised
,
and
the
corners
of
his
mouth
would
quiver
a
little
with
sad
sympathy
 
<EOS>
something
,
perhaps
old
Isaac
's
meeting
with
his
son
,
touched
him
closely
;
at
other
times
,
over
the
New
Testament
,
a
very
solemn
look
would
come
upon
his
face
,
and
he
would
every
now
and
then
shake
his
head
in
serious
assent
,
or
just
lift
up
his
hand
and
let
it
fall
again
.
<EOS>
And
on
some
mornings
,
when
he
read
in
the
Apocrypha
,
of
which
he
was
very
fond
,
the
son
of
Sirach
's
keen
-
edged
words
would
bring
a
delighted
smile
,
though
he
also
enjoyed
the
freedom
of
occasionally
differing
from
an
Apocryphal
writer
.
<EOS>
For
Adam
knew
the
Articles
quite
well
,
as
became
a
good
churchman
.
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
,
in
the
pauses
of
attending
to
her
dinner
,
always
sat
opposite
to
him
and
watched
him
,
till
she
could
rest
no
longer
without
going
up
to
him
and
giving
him
a
caress
,
to
call
his
attention
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
morning
he
was
reading
the
Gospel
according
to
St.
Matthew
,
and
Lisbeth
had
been
standing
close
by
him
for
some
minutes
,
stroking
his
hair
,
which
was
smoother
than
usual
this
morning
,
and
looking
down
at
the
large
page
with
silent
wonderment
at
the
mystery
of
letters
.
<EOS>
She
was
encouraged
to
continue
this
caress
,
because
when
she
first
went
up
to
him
,
he
had
thrown
himself
back
in
his
chair
to
look
at
her
affectionately
and
say
,
"
Why
,
Mother
,
thee
look'st
rare
and
hearty
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Eh
,
Gyp
wants
me
t
'
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
abide
to
think
I
love
thee
the
best
.
"
<EOS>
Lisbeth
said
nothing
,
because
she
wanted
to
say
so
many
things
.
<EOS>
And
now
there
was
a
new
leaf
to
be
turned
over
,
and
it
was
a
picture
 
that
of
the
angel
seated
on
the
great
stone
that
has
been
rolled
away
from
the
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
This
picture
had
one
strong
association
in
Lisbeth
's
memory
,
for
she
had
been
reminded
of
it
when
she
first
saw
Dinah
,
and
Adam
had
no
sooner
turned
the
page
,
and
lifted
the
book
sideways
that
they
might
look
at
the
angel
,
than
she
said
,
"
That
's
her
 
<EOS>
that
's
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
smiled
,
and
,
looking
more
intently
at
the
angel
's
face
,
said
,
"
It
is
a
bit
like
her
;
but
<EOS>
Dinah
's
prettier
,
I
think
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
if
thee
think'st
her
so
pretty
,
why
arn't
fond
on
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
looked
up
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
Mother
,
dost
think
I
do
n't
set
store
by
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
"
said
Lisbeth
,
frightened
at
her
own
courage
,
yet
feeling
that
she
had
broken
the
ice
,
and
the
waters
must
flow
,
whatever
mischief
they
might
do
.
<EOS>
"
What
's
th
'
use
o
'
settin
'
store
by
things
as
are
thirty
mile
off
?
<EOS>
If
thee
wast
fond
enough
on
her
,
thee
wouldstna
let
her
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
've
no
right
t
'
hinder
her
,
if
she
thinks
well
,
"
said
Adam
,
looking
at
his
book
as
if
he
wanted
to
go
on
reading
.
<EOS>
He
foresaw
a
series
of
complaints
tending
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
Lisbeth
sat
down
again
in
the
chair
opposite
to
him
,
as
she
said
:
  
"
<EOS>
But
she
wouldna
think
well
if
thee
wastna
so
contrairy
.
"
<EOS>
Lisbeth
dared
not
venture
beyond
a
vague
phrase
yet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Contrairy
,
mother
?
"
<EOS>
Adam
said
,
looking
up
again
in
some
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
?
<EOS>
What
dost
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
thee't

nothin'
,
nor

nothin'

but
thy
figurin

"
said
Lisbeth
,
half
-
crying
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An

dost
think

go
on
so
all

<EOS>
"
What

<EOS>
"
said
Adam
,
vexed
at
this
whimpering
.
<EOS>
"
I
canna

what

at

<EOS>
Is
there

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
silent
,
and
tried
to
go
on
reading
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
utmost
severity
he
could
show
towards
his
mother
on
a
Sunday
morning
.
<EOS>
But
Lisbeth
had
gone
too
far
now
to
check
herself
,
and
after
scarcely
a
minute
's
quietness
she
began
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thee

know
well
enough
who

<EOS>

said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
no

setting
thy

<EOS>
If
Dinah

ud
be
willing
to
stay
at
Hayslope
,
it
is
n't
likely
she
can
come
away
from
her

where
they
hold
her
like
a

where

as
God
didna
make

<EOS>
What
's
it
sinnify
about
her
bein
'
a
Methody

"
  
<EOS>
Adam
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
and
looked
at
his
mother
.
<EOS>
He
understood
now
what
she
had
been
aiming
at
from
the
beginning
of
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
unreasonable
,
impracticable
a
wish
as
she
had
ever
urged
,
but
he
could
not
help
being
moved
by
so
entirely
new
an
idea
.
<EOS>
The
chief
point
,
however
,
was
to
chase
away
the
notion
from
his
mother
's
mind
as
quickly
as
possible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
,
"
he
said
,
gravely
,
"
thee't
<EOS>
talking
wild
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
me
hear
thee
say
such
things
again
.
<EOS>
It
's
no
good
talking
<EOS>
o
'
what
can
never
be
.
<EOS>
Dinah
's
not
for
marrying
;
she
's
fixed
her
heart
on
a
different
sort
o
'
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
like
,
"
said
Lisbeth
,
impatiently
,
"
<EOS>
very
like
she
's
none
for
marr'ing
,
when
them
as
she
'd
be
willin
<EOS>
'
t
'
marry
wonna
ax
her
.
<EOS>
I
shouldna
ha
'
been
for
marr'ing
thy
feyther
if
he
'd
ne'er
axed
me
;
an
'
she
's
as
fond
o
<EOS>
'
thee
as
e'er
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
war
o

Thias

poor
fellow

"
  
<EOS>
The
blood
rushed
to
Adam
's
face
,
and
for
a
few
moments
he
was
not
quite
conscious
where
he
was
.
<EOS>
His
mother
and
the
kitchen
had
vanished
for
him
,
and
he
saw
nothing
but
<EOS>
Dinah
's
face
turned
up
towards
his
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
as
if
there
were
a
resurrection
of
his
dead
joy
.
<EOS>
But
he
woke
up
very
speedily
from
that
dream
(
the
waking
was
chill
and
sad
)
<EOS>
,
for
it
would
have
been
very
foolish
in
him
to
believe
his
mother
's
words
 
she
could
have
no
ground
for
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
prompted
to
express
his
disbelief
very
strongly
 
perhaps
that
he
might
call
forth
the
proofs
,
if
there
were
any
to
be
offered
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
dost
say
such
things
for
,
Mother
,
when
thee'st
got
no
foundation
for
'em
?
<EOS>
Thee
know'st
nothing
as
gives
thee
a
right
to
say
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
I
knowna
nought
as
gi'es
me
a
right
to
say
as
the
year
's
turned
,
for
all
I
feel
it
fust
thing
when
I

up

i

th

<EOS>
She

<EOS>
Seth

I
reckon
,
is
she

<EOS>
She
doesna
want
to

<EOS>
But
I
can
see
as
she
doesna
behave
tow'rt
thee
as
she
daes
tow'rt
Seth

<EOS>
She
makes
no
more

<EOS>

Seth

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
thee
canstna
be
sure

the
trembling
means

"
said
Adam
anxiously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Eh
,
what
else
should
it
mane
?
<EOS>
It
isna
hate
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
An
'
what

<EOS>
Thee't

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
had
thrust
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
and
was
looking
down
at
the
book
on
the
table
,
without
seeing
any
of
the
letters
.
<EOS>
He
was
trembling
like
a
gold
-
seeker
who
sees
the
strong
promise
of
gold
but
sees
in
the
same
moment
a
sickening
vision
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
trust
his
mother
's
insight
;
she
had
seen
what
she
wished
to
see
.
<EOS>
And
yet
 
<EOS>
and
yet
,
now
the
suggestion
had
been
made
to
him
,
he
remembered
so
many
things
,
very
slight
things
,
like
the
stirring
of
the
water
by
an
imperceptible
breeze
,
which
seemed
to
him
some
confirmation
of
his
mother
's
words
.
  
<EOS>
Lisbeth
noticed
that
he
was
moved
.
<EOS>
She
went
on
,
"
An
'
thee't
find
out
as
thee't
<EOS>
poorly
aff
when
she
's
gone
.
<EOS>
Thee't
fonder
on
her
nor
thee
know'st
.
<EOS>
Thy
eyes
follow
her
about
,
welly
as
Gyp
's
follow
thee
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
could
sit
still
no
longer
.
<EOS>
He
rose
,
took
down
his
hat
,
and
went
out
into
the
fields
.
  
<EOS>
The
sunshine
was
on
them
:
that
early
autumn
sunshine
which
we
should
know
was
not
summer
's
,
even
if
there
were
not
the
touches
of
yellow
on
the
lime
and
chestnut
;
<EOS>
the
Sunday
sunshine
too
,
which
has
more
than
autumnal
calmness
for
the
working
man
;
the
morning
sunshine
,
which
still
leaves
the
dew
-
crystals
on
the
fine
gossamer
webs
in
the
shadow
of
the
bushy
hedgerows
.
  
<EOS>
Adam
needed
the
calm
influence
;
he
was
amazed
at
the
way
in
which
this
new
thought
of
Dinah
's
love
had
taken
possession
of
him
,
with
an
overmastering
power
that
made
all
other
feelings
give
way
before
the
impetuous
desire
to
know
that
the
thought
was
true
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
that
till
that
moment
the
possibility
of
their
ever
being
lovers
had
never
crossed
his
mind
,
and
yet
now
,
all
his
longing
suddenly
went
out
towards
that
possibility
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
more
doubt
or
hesitation
as
to
his
own
wishes
than
the
bird
that
flies
towards
the
opening
through
which
the
daylight
gleams
and
the
breath
of
heaven
enters
.
  
<EOS>
The
autumnal
Sunday
sunshine
soothed
him
,
but
not
by
preparing
him
with
resignation
to
the
disappointment
if
his
mother
 
if
he
himself
 
proved
to
be
mistaken
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
It
soothed
him
by
gentle
encouragement
of
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
Her
love
was
so
like
that
calm
sunshine
that
they
seemed
to
make
one
presence
to
him
,
and
he
believed
in
them
both
alike
.
<EOS>
And
Dinah
was
so
bound
up
with
the
sad
memories
of
his
first
passion
that
he
was
not
forsaking
them
,
but
rather
giving
them
a
new
sacredness
by
loving
her
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
his
love
for
her
had
grown
out
of
that
past
:
it
was
the
noon
of
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
But
Seth
?
<EOS>
Would
the
lad
be
hurt
?
<EOS>
Hardly
;
for
he
had
seemed
quite
contented
of
late
,
and
there
was
no
selfish
jealousy
in
him
;
he
had
never
been
jealous
of
his
mother
's
fondness
for
Adam
.
<EOS>
But
had
he
seen
anything
of
what
their
mother
talked
about
?
<EOS>
Adam
longed
to
know
this
,
for
he
thought
he
could
trust
Seth
's
observation
better
than
his
mother
's
.
<EOS>
He
must
talk
to
Seth
before
he
went
to
see
Dinah
,
and
,
with
this
intention
in
his
mind
,
he
walked
back
to
the
cottage
and
said
to
his
mother
,
"
Did
Seth
say
anything
to
thee
about
when
he
was
coming
home
?
<EOS>
Will
he
be
back
to
dinner
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
lad
,
he
'll
be
back
for
a
wonder
.
<EOS>
He
isna
gone
to
Treddles'on
.
<EOS>
He
's
gone
somewhere
else
a
-
preachin
'
and
a
-
prayin
'
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hast
any
notion
which
way
he
's
gone
?
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
but
he
aften
goes
to
th
'
Common
.
<EOS>
Thee
know'st
more
o
's
goings
nor
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
wanted
to
go
and
meet
Seth
,
but
he
must
content
himself
with
walking
about
the
near
fields
and
getting
sight
of
him
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
That
would
not
be
for
more
than
an
hour
to
come
,
for
Seth
would
scarcely
be
at
home
much
before
their
dinner
-
time
,
which
was
twelve
o'clock
.
<EOS>
But
Adam
could
not
sit
down
to
his
reading
again
,
and
he
sauntered
along
by
the
brook
and
stood
leaning
against
the
stiles
,
with
eager
intense
eyes
,
which
looked
as
if
they
saw
something
very
vividly
;
but
it
was
not
the
brook
or
the
willows
,
not
the
fields
or
the
sky
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
his
vision
was
interrupted
by
wonder
at
the
strength
of
his
own
feeling
,
at
the
strength
and
sweetness
of
this
new
love
 
almost
like
the
wonder
a
man
feels
at
the
added
power
he
finds
in
himself
for
an
art
which
he
had
laid
aside
for
a
space
.
<EOS>
How
is
it
that
the
poets
have
said
so
many
fine
things
about
our
first
love
,
so
few
about
our
later
love
?
<EOS>
Are
their
first
poems
their
best
?
<EOS>
Or
are
not
those
the
best
which
come
from
their
fuller
thought
,
their
larger
experience
,
their
deeper
-
rooted
affections
?
<EOS>
The
boy
's
flutelike
voice
has
its
own
spring
charm
;
but
the
man
should
yield
a
richer
deeper
music
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
there
was
Seth
,
visible
at
the
farthest
stile
,
and
Adam
hastened
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Seth
was
surprised
,
and
thought
something
unusual
must
have
happened
,
but
when
Adam
came
up
,
his
face
said
plainly
enough
that
it
was
nothing
alarming
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
hast
been
?
"
said
Adam
,
when
they
were
side
by
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
to
the
Common
,
"
said
Seth
.
<EOS>
"
Dinah
's
been
speaking
the
Word
to
a
little
company
of
hearers
at
Brimstone
's
,
as
they
call
him
.
<EOS>
They
're
folks
as
never
go
to
church
hardly
 
them
on
the
Common
 
<EOS>
but
they
'll
go
and
hear
Dinah
a
bit
.
<EOS>
She
's
been
speaking
with
power
this
forenoon
from
the
words
,
"
I
came
not
to
call
the
righteous
,
but
sinners
to
repentance
.
"
<EOS>
And
there
was
a
little
thing
happened
as
was
pretty
to
see
.
<EOS>
The
women
mostly
bring
their
children
with
'em
,
but
to
-
day
there
was
one
stout
curly
headed
fellow
about
three
or
four
year
old
,
that
I
never
saw
there
before
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
naughty
as
could
be
at
the
beginning
while
I
was
praying
,
and
while
we
was
singing
,
but
when
we
all
sat
down
and
Dinah
began
to
speak
,
th
'
young
un
stood
stock
still
all
at
once
,
and
began
to
look
at
her
with
's
mouth
open
,
and
presently
he
ran
away
from
<EOS>
's
mother
and
went
to
Dinah
,
and
pulled
at
her
,
like
a
little
dog
,
for
her
to
take
notice
of
him
.
<EOS>
So
Dinah
lifted
him
up
and
held
th
'
lad
on
her
lap
,
while
she
went
on
speaking
;
and
he
was
as
good
as
could
be
till
he
went
to
sleep
 
and
the
mother
cried
to
see
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
pity
<EOS>
she
shouldna
be
a
mother
herself
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
so
fond
as
the
children
are
of
her
.
<EOS>
Dost
think
she
's
quite
fixed
against
marrying
,
Seth
?
<EOS>
Dost
think
nothing
'
ud
turn
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
peculiar
in
his
brother
's
tone
,
which
made
Seth
steal
a
glance
at
his
face
before
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
be
wrong
of
me
to
say
nothing
'
ud
turn
her
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
thee
mean'st
it
about
myself
,
I
've
given
up
all
thoughts
as
she
can
ever
be
my
wife
.
<EOS>
She
calls
me
her
brother
,
and
that
's
enough
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
dost
think
she
might
ever
get
fond
enough
of
anybody
else
to
be
willing
to
marry
'
em
?
"
said
Adam
rather
shyly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Seth
,
after
some
hesitation
,
"
it
's
crossed
my
mind
sometimes
<EOS>
o
'
late
as
she
might
;
but
Dinah
'
ud
let
no
fondness
for
the
creature
draw
her
out
<EOS>
o
'
the
path
as
she
believed
God
had
marked
out
for
her
.
<EOS>
If
she
thought
the
leading
was
not
from
Him
,
she
's
not
one
to
be
brought
under
the
power
of
it
.
<EOS>
And
she
's
allays
seemed
clear
about
that
 
as
her
work
was
to
minister
t
'
others
,
and
make
no
home
for
herself
<EOS>
i
'
this
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
But
suppose
,
"
said
Adam
,
earnestly
,
"
suppose
there
was
a
man
as
'
ud
let
her
do
just
the
same
and
not
interfere
with
her
 
<EOS>
she
might
do
a
good
deal
o
'
what
she
does
now
,
just
as
well
when
she
was
married
as
when
she
was
single
.
<EOS>
Other
women
of
her
sort
have
married
 
<EOS>
that
's
to
say
,
not
just
like
her
,
but
women
as
preached
and
attended
on
the
sick
and
needy
.
<EOS>
There
's
Mrs.
Fletcher
as
she
talks
of
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
new
light
had
broken
in
on
Seth
.
<EOS>
He
turned
round
,
and
laying
his
hand
on
Adam
's
shoulder
,
said
,
"
Why
,
wouldst
like
her
to
marry
THEE
,
Brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
looked
doubtfully
at
Seth
's
inquiring
eyes
and
said
,
"
Wouldst
be
hurt
if
she
was
to
be
<EOS>
fonder
o
<EOS>
'
me
than
o
'
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
Seth
warmly
,
"
how
canst
think
it
?
<EOS>
Have
I
felt
thy
trouble
so
little
that
I
shouldna
feel
thy
joy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
silence
a
few
moments
as
they
walked
on
,
and
then
Seth
said
,
"
I
'd
no
notion
as
thee'dst
ever
think
of
her
for
a
wife

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
is
it
o
'
any
use
to
think
of
her
?
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
What
dost
say
?
<EOS>
Mother
's
made
me
as
I
hardly
know
where
I
am
,
with
what
she
's
been
saying
to
me
this
forenoon
.
<EOS>
She
says
she
's
sure
Dinah
feels
for
me
more
than
common
,
and
'
ud
be
willing
t
'
have
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
'm
afraid
she
speaks
without
book
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
if
thee'st
seen
anything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
nice
point
to
speak
about
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
and
I
'm
afraid
o
'
being
wrong
;
besides
,
we
've
no
right
t
'
intermeddle
with
people
's
feelings
when
they
would
n't
tell
'em
themselves
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
paused
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
thee
mightst
ask
her
,
"
he
said
presently
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
took
no
offence
at
me
for
asking
,
and
thee'st
more
right
than
I
had
,
only
thee't
not
in
the
Society
.
<EOS>
But
Dinah
does
n't
hold
wi
'
them
as
are
for
keeping
the
Society
so
strict
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
mind
about
making
folks
enter
the
Society
,
so
as
they
're
fit
t
'
enter
the
kingdom
o
'
God
.
<EOS>
Some
o
'
<EOS>
the
brethren
at
Treddles'on
are
displeased
with
her
for
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
will
she
be
the
rest
o
'
the
day
?
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
said
she
should
n't
leave
the
farm
again
to
-
day
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
because
it
's
her
last
Sabbath
there
,
and
she
's
going
t
'
read
out
<EOS>
o
'
<EOS>
the
big
Bible
<EOS>
wi
'
the
children
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
thought
 
but
did
not
say
 
"
Then
I
'll
go
this
afternoon
;
for
if
I
go
to
church
,
my
thoughts
'
ull
be
with
her
all
the
while
.
<EOS>
They
must
sing
th
'
anthem
without
me
to
-
day
.
"
    
<EOS>
Adam
and
Dinah
  
<EOS>
IT
was
about
three
o'clock
when
Adam
entered
the
farmyard
and
roused
Alick
and
the
dogs
from
their
Sunday
dozing
.
<EOS>
Alick
said
everybody
was
gone
to
church
"
but
th
'
young
missis
"
 
<EOS>
so
he
called
Dinah
 
<EOS>
but
this
did
not
disappoint
Adam
,
although
the
"
everybody
"
was
so
liberal
as
to
include
Nancy
the
dairymaid
,
whose
works
of
necessity
were
not
unfrequently
incompatible
with
church
-
going
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
perfect
stillness
about
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
doors
were
all
closed
,
and
the
very
stones
and
tubs
seemed
quieter
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Adam
heard
the
water
gently
dripping
from
the
pump
 
that
was
the
only
sound
 
and
he
knocked
at
the
house
door
rather
softly
,
as
was
suitable
in
that
stillness
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
,
and
Dinah
stood
before
him
,
colouring
deeply
with
the
great
surprise
of
seeing
Adam
at
this
hour
,
when
she
knew
it
was
his
regular
practice
to
be
at
church
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
he
would
have
said
to
her
without
any
difficulty
,
"
I
came
to
see
you
,
Dinah
<EOS>
:
I
knew
the
rest
were
not
at
home
.
"
<EOS>
But
to
-
day
something
prevented
him
from
saying
that
,
and
he
put
out
his
hand
to
her
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
spoke
,
and
yet
both
wished
they
could
speak
,
as
Adam
entered
,
and
they
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Dinah
took
the
chair
she
had
just
left
;
it
was
at
the
corner
of
the
table
near
the
window
,
and
there
was
a
book
lying
on
the
table
,
but
it
was
not
open
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
sitting
perfectly
still
,
looking
at
the
small
bit
of
clear
fire
in
the
bright
grate
.
<EOS>
Adam
sat
down
opposite
her
,
in
Mr.
Poyser
's
three
-
cornered
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
mother
is
not
ill
again
,
I
hope
,
Adam
?
"
<EOS>
Dinah
said
,
recovering
herself
.
"
<EOS>
Seth
said
she
was
well
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
she
's
very
hearty
to
-
day
,
"
said
Adam
,
happy
in
the
signs
of
Dinah
's
feeling
at
the
sight
of
him
,
but
shy
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
nobody
at
home
,
you
see
,
"
Dinah
said
;
"
but
you
'll
wait
.
<EOS>
You
've
been
hindered
from
going
to
church
to
-
day
,
doubtless
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
Adam
said
,
and
then
paused
,
before
he
added
,
"
I
was
thinking
about
you
:
that
was
the
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
confession
was
very
awkward
and
sudden
<EOS>
,
Adam
felt
,
for
he
thought
Dinah
must
understand
all
he
meant
.
<EOS>
But
the
frankness
of
the
words
caused
her
immediately
to
interpret
them
into
a
renewal
of
his
brotherly
regrets
that
she
was
going
away
,
and
she
answered
calmly
,
"
Do
not
be
careful
and
troubled
for
me
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
I
have
all
things
and
abound
at
Snowfield
.
<EOS>
And
my
mind
is
at
rest
,
for
I
am
not
seeking
my
own
will
in
going
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
things
were
different
,
Dinah
,
"
said
Adam
,
hesitatingly
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
knew
things
that
perhaps
you
do
n't
know
now
....
"
  
Dinah
looked
at
him
inquiringly
,
but
instead
of
going
on
,
he
reached
a
chair
and
brought
it
near
the
corner
of
the
table
where
she
was
sitting
.
<EOS>
She
wondered
,
and
was
afraid
 
and
the
next
moment
her
thoughts
flew
to
the
past
:
was
it
something
about
those
distant
unhappy
ones
that
she
did
n't
know
?
  
<EOS>
Adam
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
sweet
to
look
at
her
eyes
,
which
had
now
a
self
-
forgetful
questioning
in
them
 
for
a
moment
he
forgot
that
he
wanted
to
say
anything
,
or
that
it
was
necessary
to
tell
her
what
he
meant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dinah
,
"
he
said
suddenly
,
taking
both
her
hands
between
his
,
"
I
love
you
with
my
whole
heart
and
soul
.
<EOS>
I
love
you
next
to
God
who
made
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
's
lips
became
pale
,
like
her
cheeks
,
and
she
trembled
violently
under
the
shock
of
painful
joy
.
<EOS>
Her
hands
were
cold
as
death
between
Adam
's
.
<EOS>
She
could
not
draw
them
away
,
because
he
held
them
fast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
tell
me
you
ca
n't
love
me
,
Dinah
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
tell
me
we
must
part
and
pass
our
lives
away
from
one
another
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
tears
were
trembling
in
Dinah
's
eyes
,
and
they
fell
before
she
could
answer
.
<EOS>
But
she
spoke
in
a
quiet
low
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
dear
Adam
,
we
must
submit
to
another
Will
.
<EOS>
We
must
part
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
if
you
love
me
,
Dinah
 
not
if
you
love
me
,
"
Adam
said
passionately
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
 
tell
me
if
you
can
love
me
better
than
a
brother
?
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
was
too
entirely
reliant
on
the
Supreme
guidance
to
attempt
to
achieve
any
end
by
a
deceptive
concealment
.
<EOS>
She
was
recovering
now
from
the
first
shock
of
emotion
,
and
she
looked
at
Adam
with
simple
sincere
eyes
as
she
said
,
"
Yes
,
Adam
,
my
heart
is
drawn
strongly
towards
you
;
and
of
my
own
will
,
if
I
had
no
clear
showing
to
the
contrary
,
I
could
find
my
happiness
in
being
near
you
and
ministering
to
you
continually
.
<EOS>
I
fear
I
should
forget
to
rejoice
and
weep
with
others
;
nay
,
I
fear
I
should
forget
the
Divine
presence
,
and
seek
no
love
but
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
did
not
speak
immediately
.
<EOS>
They
sat
looking
at
each
other
in
delicious
silence
 
for
the
first
sense
of
mutual
love
excludes
other
feelings
;
it
will
have
the
soul
all
to
itself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
Dinah
,
"
Adam
said
at
last
,
"
how
can
there
be
anything
contrary
to
what
's
right
in
our
belonging
to
one
another
and
spending
our
lives
together
?
<EOS>
Who
put
this
great
love
into
our
hearts
?
<EOS>
Can
anything
be
holier
than
that
?
<EOS>
For
we
can
help
one
another
in
everything
as
is
good
.
<EOS>
I
'd
never
think
o
'
putting
myself
between
you
and
God
,
and
saying
you
ought
n't
to
do
this
<EOS>
and
you
ought
n't
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
You
'd
follow
your
conscience
as
much
as
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Adam
,
"
Dinah
said
,
"
I
know
marriage
is
a
holy
state
for
those
who
are
truly
called
to
it
,
and
have
no
other
drawing
;
but
from
my
childhood
upwards
<EOS>
I
have
been
led
towards
another
path
;
all
my
peace
and
my
joy
have
come
from
having
no
life
of
my
own
,
no
wants
,
no
wishes
for
myself
,
and
living
only
in
God
and
those
of
his
creatures
whose
sorrows
and
joys
he
has
given
me
to
know
.
<EOS>
Those
have
been
very
blessed
years
to
me
,
and
I
feel
that
if
I
was
to
listen
to
any
voice
that
would
draw
me
aside
from
that
path
,
I
should
be
turning
my
back
on
the
light
that
has
shone
upon
me
,
and
darkness
and
doubt
would
take
hold
of
me
.
<EOS>
We
could
not
bless
each
other
,
Adam
,
if
there
were
doubts
in
my
soul
,
and
if
I
yearned
,
when
it
was
too
late
,
after
that
better
part
which
had
once
been
given
me
<EOS>
and
I
had
put
away
from
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
if
a
new
feeling
has
come
into
your
mind
,
Dinah
,
and
if
you
love
me
so
as
to
be
willing
to
be
nearer
to
me
than
to
other
people
,
is
n't
that
a
sign
that
it
's
right
for
you
to
change
your
life
?
<EOS>
Does
n't
the
love
make
it
right
when
nothing
else
would
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
my
mind
is
full
of
questionings
about
that
;
for
now
,
since
you
tell
me
of
your
strong
love
towards
me
,
what
was
clear
to
me
has
become
dark
again
.
<EOS>
I
felt
before
that
my
heart
was
too
strongly
drawn
towards
you
,
and
that
your
heart
was
not
as
mine
;
and
the
thought
of
you
had
taken
hold
of
me
,
so
that
my
soul
had
lost
its
freedom
,
and
was
becoming
enslaved
to
an
earthly
affection
,
which
made
me
anxious
and
careful
about
what
should
befall
myself
.
<EOS>
For
in
all
other
affection
I
had
been
content
with
any
small
return
,
or
with
none
;
but
my
heart
was
beginning
to
hunger
after
an
equal
love
from
you
.
<EOS>
And
I
had
no
doubt
that
I
must
wrestle
against
that
as
a
great
temptation
,
and
the
command
was
clear
that
I
must
go
away
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
now
,
dear
,
dear
Dinah
,
now
you
know
I
love
you
better
than
you
love
me
...
<EOS>
it
's
all
different
now
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
think
o
'
going
.
<EOS>
You
'll
stay
,
and
be
my
dear
wife
,
and
I
shall
thank
God
for
giving
me
my
life
as
I
never
thanked
him
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
it
's
hard
to
me
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
...
<EOS>
you
know
it
's
hard
;
but
a
great
fear
is
upon
me
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
as
if
you
were
stretching
out
your
arms
to
me
,
and
beckoning
me
to
come
and
take
my
ease
and
live
for
my
own
delight
,
and
Jesus
,
the
Man
of
Sorrows
,
was
standing
looking
towards
me
,
and
pointing
to
the
sinful
,
and
suffering
,
and
afflicted
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
that
again
and
again
when
I
have
been
sitting
in
stillness
and
darkness
,
and
a
great
terror
has
come
upon
me
lest
I
should
become
hard
,
and
a
lover
of
self
,
and
no
more
bear
willingly
the
Redeemer
's
cross
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
had
closed
her
eyes
,
and
a
faint
shudder
went
through
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Adam
,
"
she
went
on
,
"
you
would
n't
desire
that
we
should
seek
a
good
through
any
unfaithfulness
to
the
light
that
is
in
us
;
you
would
n't
believe
that
could
be
a
good
.
<EOS>
We
are
of
one
mind
in
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
,
Dinah
,
"
said
Adam
sadly
,
"
I
'll
never
be
<EOS>
the
man
t
'
urge
you
against
your
conscience
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
give
up
the
hope
that
you
may
come
to
see
different
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
your
loving
me
could
shut
up
your
heart
 
<EOS>
it
's
only
adding
to
what
you
've
been
before
,
not
taking
away
from
it
.
<EOS>
For
it
seems
to
me
<EOS>
it
's
the
same
with
love
and
happiness
as
with
sorrow
 
the
more
we
know
of
it
<EOS>
the
better
we
can
feel
what
other
people
's
lives
are
or
might
be
,
and
so
we
shall
only
be
more
tender
to
'em
,
and
wishful
to
help
'em
.
<EOS>
The
more
knowledge
a
man
has
,
the
better
he
'll
do
's
work
;
and
feeling
's
a
sort
o
'
knowledge
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
was
silent
;
her
eyes
were
fixed
in
contemplation
of
something
visible
only
to
herself
.
<EOS>
Adam
went
on
presently
with
his
pleading
,
"
And
you
can
do
almost
as
much
as
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
ask
you
to
go
to
church
with
me
of
a
Sunday
.
<EOS>
You
shall
go
where
you
like
among
the
people
,
and
teach
'em
;
for
though
I
like
church
best
,
I
do
n't
put
my
soul
above
yours
,
as
if
my
words
was
better
for
you
to
follow
than
your
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
And
you
can
help
the
sick
just
as
much
,
and
you
'll
have
more
means
o
'
making
'em
a
bit
comfortable
;
and
you
'll
be
among
all
your
own
friends
as
love
you
,
and
can
help
'em
and
be
a
blessing
to
'em
till
their
dying
day
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
Dinah
,
you
'd
be
as
near
to
God
as
if
you
was
living
lonely
and
away
from
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
made
no
answer
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
still
holding
her
hands
and
looking
at
her
with
almost
trembling
anxiety
,
when
she
turned
her
grave
loving
eyes
on
his
and
said
,
in
rather
a
sad
voice
,
"
Adam
there
is
truth
in
what
you
say
,
and
there
's
many
of
the
brethren
and
sisters
who
have
greater
strength
than
I
have
,
and
find
their
hearts
enlarged
by
the
cares
of
husband
and
kindred
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
not
faith
that
it
would
be
so
with
me
,
<EOS>
for
since
my
affections
have
been
set
above
measure
on
you
,
I
have
had
less
peace
and
joy
in
God
.
<EOS>
I
have
felt
as
it
were
a
division
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
And
think
how
it
is
with
me
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
That
life
I
have
led
is
like
a
land
I
have
trodden
in
blessedness
since
my
childhood
;
and
if
I
long
for
a
moment
to
follow
the
voice
which
calls
me
to
another
land
that
I
know
not
,
I
can
not
but
fear
that
my
soul
might
hereafter
yearn
for
that
early
blessedness
which
I
had
forsaken
;
and
where
doubt
enters
there
is
not
perfect
love
.
<EOS>
I
must
wait
for
clearer
guidance
.
<EOS>
I
must
go
from
you
,
and
we
must
submit
ourselves
entirely
to
the
Divine
Will
.
<EOS>
We
are
sometimes
required
to
lay
our
natural
lawful
affections
on
the
altar
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
dared
not
plead
again
,
for
Dinah
's
was
not
the
voice
of
caprice
or
insincerity
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
very
hard
for
him
;
his
eyes
got
dim
as
he
looked
at
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
you
may
come
to
feel
satisfied
...
to
feel
that
you
may
come
to
me
again
,
and
we
may
never
part
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
submit
ourselves
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
With
time
,
our
duty
will
be
made
clear
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
when
I
have
entered
on
my
former
life
,
I
shall
find
all
these
new
thoughts
and
wishes
vanish
,
and
become
as
things
that
were
not
.
<EOS>
Then
I
shall
know
that
my
calling
is
not
towards
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
we
must
wait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dinah
,
"
said
Adam
mournfully
,
"
you
ca
n't
love
me
so
well
as
I
love
you
,
else
you
'd
have
no
doubts
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
natural
<EOS>
you
should
n't
,
for
I
'm
not
so
good
as
you
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
doubt
it
's
right
for
me
to
love
the
best
thing
God
's
ever
given
me
to
know
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
It
seems
to
me
that
my
love
for
you
is
not
weak
,
for
my
heart
waits
on
your
words
and
looks
,
almost
as
a
little
child
waits
on
the
help
and
tenderness
of
the
strong
on
whom
it
depends
.
<EOS>
If
the
thought
of
you
took
slight
hold
of
me
,
I
should
not
fear
that
it
would
be
an
idol
in
the
temple
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
strengthen
me
 
you
will
not
hinder
me
in
seeking
to
obey
to
the
uttermost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
out
into
the
sunshine
,
Dinah
,
and
walk
together
.
<EOS>
I
'll
speak
no
word
to
disturb
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
out
and
walked
towards
the
fields
,
where
they
would
meet
the
family
coming
from
church
.
<EOS>
Adam
said
,
"
Take
my
arm
,
Dinah
,
"
and
she
took
it
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
only
change
in
their
manner
to
each
other
since
they
were
last
walking
together
.
<EOS>
But
no
sadness
in
the
prospect
of
her
going
away
 
in
the
uncertainty
of
the
issue
 
could
rob
the
sweetness
from
Adam
's
sense
that
Dinah
loved
him
.
<EOS>
He
thought
he
would
stay
at
the
Hall
Farm
all
that
evening
.
<EOS>
He
would
be
near
her
as
long
as
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hey
-
day
!
<EOS>
There
's
Adam
along
wi
'
Dinah
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
as
he
opened
the
far
gate
into
the
Home
Close
.
<EOS>
"
I
couldna
think
how
he
happened
away
from
church
.
<EOS>
Why
,
"
added
good
Martin
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
what
dost
think
has
just
jumped
into
my
head
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Summat
as
hadna
far
to
jump
,
for
it
's
just
under
our
nose
.
<EOS>
You
mean
as
Adam
's
fond
o
'
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
!
<EOS>
hast
ever
had
any
notion
of
it
before
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
To
be
sure
I
have
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
always
declined
,
if
possible
,
to
be
taken
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
not
one
o
'
those
as
can
see
the
cat
<EOS>
i
'
the
dairy
an

wonder
what
she
's
come
after

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thee
never
saidst
a
word
to
me
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
are
n't
like
a
bird
-
clapper
,
forced
to
make
a
rattle
when
the
wind
blows
on
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
keep
my
own
counsel
when
there
's
no
good
i

speaking

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
Dinah
'll
ha

none

<EOS>
him
.
<EOS>
Dost
think
she
will
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
not
sufficiently
on
her
guard
against
a
possible
surprise
,
"
she
'll
never
marry
anybody
,
if
he
is
n't
a
Methodist
and
a
cripple

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
'
ud
ha
'
been
a
pretty
thing
though
for
<EOS>
'em
t
'
marry
,
"
said
Martin
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
,
as
if
in
pleased
contemplation
of
his
new
idea
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee'dst
ha
'
liked
it
too
,
wouldstna
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
should
.
<EOS>
I
should
ha
'
been
sure
of
her
then
,
as
she
would
n't
go
away
from
me
to
Snowfield
,
welly
thirty
mile
off
,
and
me
not
got
a
creatur
to
look
to
,
only
neighbours
,
as
are
no
kin
to
me
,
an

most
of

women
as
I
'd
be
ashamed
to
show
my
face
,
if
my
dairy
things
war
like
their'n

<EOS>
There
may
well
be
streaky
butter
<EOS>
i
'
the
market
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
see
the
poor
thing
settled
like
a
Christian
woman
,
with
a
house
of
her
own
over
her
head
;
and
we
'd
stock
her
well
wi
'
linen
and
feathers
,
for
I
love
her
next
to
my
own
children
.
<EOS>
An
'
<EOS>
she
makes
one
feel
safer
when
she
's
i
'
the
house
,
for
she
's
like
the
driven
snow
:
anybody
might
sin
for
two
as
had
her
at
their
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dinah
,
"
said
Tommy
,
running
forward
to
meet
her
,
"
mother
says
you
'll
never
marry
anybody
but
a
Methodist
cripple
.
<EOS>
What
a
silly
you
must
be
!
"
<EOS>
a
comment
which
Tommy
followed
up
by
seizing
Dinah
with
both
arms
,
and
dancing
along
by
her
side
with
incommodious
fondness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Adam
,
we
missed
you
<EOS>
i
'
the
singing
to
-
day
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
How
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wanted
to
see
Dinah
 
<EOS>
she
's
going
away
so
soon
,
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
lad
!
<EOS>
Can
you
persuade
her
to
stop
somehow
?
<EOS>
Find
her
a
good
husband
<EOS>
somewhere
<EOS>
i
'
the
parish
.
<EOS>
If
you
'll
do
that
,
we
'll
forgive
you
for
missing
church
.
<EOS>
But
,
anyway
,
she
isna
going
before
the
harvest
supper
o
'
Wednesday
,
and
you
must
come
then
.
<EOS>
There
's
Bartle
Massey
comin

<EOS>
You
'll
be
sure
an
'
come

now
,
at
seven
?
<EOS>
The
missis
wunna
have
it
a
bit
later
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
I
'll
come
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
But
I
ca
n't
often
say
what
I
'll
do
beforehand
,
for
the
work
often
holds
me
longer
than
I
expect
.
<EOS>
You
'll
stay
till
the
end
<EOS>
o
'
the
week
,
Dinah
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
!
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
We
'll
have
no
nay
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
no
call
to
be
in
a
hurry
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Scarceness
o
'
victual
'
ull
keep
:
there
's
no
need
to
be
hasty
wi

the
cooking
.
<EOS>
An
'
scarceness
is
what
there
's
the
biggest
stock
of
i
'
that
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
smiled
,
but
gave
no
promise
to
stay
,
and
they
talked
of
other
things
through
the
rest
of
the
walk
,
lingering
in
the
sunshine
to
look
at
the
great
flock
of
geese
grazing
,
at
the
new
corn
-
ricks
,
and
at
the
surprising
abundance
of
fruit
on
the
old
pear
-
tree
;
Nancy
and
Molly
having
already
hastened
home
,
side
by
side
,
each
holding
,
carefully
wrapped
in
her
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
a
prayer
-
book
,
in
which
she
could
read
little
beyond
the
large
letters
and
the
Amens
.
  
<EOS>
Surely
all
other
leisure
is
hurry
compared
with
a
sunny
walk
through
the
fields
from
"
afternoon
church
"
 
as
such
walks
used
to
be
in
those
old
leisurely
times
,
when
the
boat
,
gliding
sleepily
along
the
canal
,
was
the
newest
locomotive
wonder
;
when
Sunday
books
had
most
of
them
old
brown
-
leather
covers
,
and
opened
with
remarkable
precision
always
in
one
place
.
<EOS>
Leisure
is
gone
 
<EOS>
gone
where
the
spinning
-
wheels
are
gone
,
and
the
pack
-
horses
,
and
the
slow
waggons
,
and
the
pedlars
,
who
brought
bargains
to
the
door
on
sunny
afternoons
.
<EOS>
Ingenious
philosophers
tell
you
,
perhaps
,
that
the
great
work
of
the
steam
-
engine
is
to
create
leisure
for
mankind
.
<EOS>
Do
not
believe
them
:
it
only
creates
a
vacuum
for
eager
thought
to
rush
in
.
<EOS>
Even
idleness
is
eager
now
 
eager
for
amusement
;
prone
to
excursion
-
trains
,
art
museums
,
periodical
literature
,
and
exciting
novels
;
prone
even
to
scientific
theorizing
and
cursory
peeps
through
microscopes
.
<EOS>
Old
Leisure
was
quite
a
different
personage
.
<EOS>
He
only
read
one
newspaper
,
innocent
of
leaders
,
and
was
free
from
that
periodicity
of
sensations
which
we
call
post
-
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
contemplative
,
rather
stout
gentleman
,
of
excellent
digestion
;
of
quiet
perceptions
,
undiseased
by
hypothesis
;
happy
in
his
inability
to
know
the
causes
of
things
,
preferring
the
things
themselves
.
<EOS>
He
lived
chiefly
in
the
country
,
among
pleasant
seats
and
homesteads
,
and
was
fond
of
sauntering
by
the
fruit
-
tree
wall
and
scenting
the
apricots
when
they
were
warmed
by
the
morning
sunshine
,
or
of
sheltering
himself
under
the
orchard
boughs
at
noon
,
when
the
summer
pears
were
falling
.
<EOS>
He
knew
nothing
of
weekday
services
,
and
thought
none
the
worse
of
the
Sunday
sermon
if
it
allowed
him
to
sleep
from
the
text
to
the
blessing
;
liking
the
afternoon
service
best
,
because
the
prayers
were
the
shortest
,
and
not
ashamed
to
say
so
;
for
he
had
an
easy
,
jolly
conscience
,
broad
-
backed
like
himself
,
and
able
to
carry
a
great
deal
of
beer
or
port
-
wine
,
not
being
made
squeamish
by
doubts
and
qualms
and
lofty
aspirations
.
<EOS>
Life
was
not
a
task
to
him
,
but
a
sinecure
.
<EOS>
He
fingered
the
guineas
in
his
pocket
,
and
ate
his
dinners
,
and
slept
the
sleep
of
the
irresponsible
,
for
had
he
not
kept
up
his
character
by
going
to
church
on
the
Sunday
afternoons
?
  
<EOS>
Fine
old
Leisure
!
<EOS>
Do
not
be
severe
upon
him
,
and
judge
him
by
our
modern
standard
.
<EOS>
He
never
went
to
Exeter
Hall
,
or
heard
a
popular
preacher
,
or
read
Tracts
for
the
Times
or
Sartor
Resartus
.
    
<EOS>
The
Harvest
Supper
  
<EOS>
As
Adam
was
going
homeward
,
on
Wednesday
evening
,
in
the
six
o'clock
sunlight
,
he
saw
in
the
distance
the
last
load
of
barley
winding
its
way
towards
the
yard
-
gate
of
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
heard
the
chant
of
"
Harvest
Home
!
"
<EOS>
rising
and
sinking
like
a
wave
.
<EOS>
Fainter
and
fainter
,
and
more
musical
through
the
growing
distance
,
the
falling
dying
sound
still
reached
him
,
as
he
neared
the
Willow
Brook
.
<EOS>
The
low
westering
sun
shone
right
on
the
shoulders
of
the
old
Binton
Hills
,
turning
the
unconscious
sheep
into
bright
spots
of
light
;
shone
on
the
windows
of
the
cottage
too
,
and
made
them
a
-
flame
with
a
glory
beyond
that
of
amber
or
amethyst
.
<EOS>
It
was
enough
to
make
Adam
feel
that
he
was
in
a
great
temple
,
and
that
the
distant
chant
was
a
sacred
song
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
wonderful
,
"
he
thought
,
"
how
that
sound
goes
to
one
's
heart
almost
like
a
funeral
bell
,
for
all
it
tells
one
o
'
the
joyfullest
time
<EOS>
o
'
the
year
,
and
the
time
when
men
are
mostly
the
thankfullest
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
's
a
bit
hard
to
us
to
think
anything
's
over
and
gone
in
our
lives
;
and
there
's
a
parting
at
the
root
of
all
our
joys
.
<EOS>
It
's
like
what
I
feel
about
Dinah
.
<EOS>
I
should
never
ha
'
come
to
know
that
her
love
'
ud
be
the
greatest
o
'
blessings
to
me
,
if
what
I
counted
a
blessing
had
n't
been
wrenched
and
torn
away
from
me
,
and
left
me
with
a
greater
need
,
so
as
I
could
crave
and
hunger
for
a
greater
and
a
better
comfort
.

He
expected
to
see
Dinah
again
this
evening
,
and
get
leave
to
accompany
her
as
far
as
Oakbourne
;
and
then
he
would
ask
her
to
fix
some
time
when
he
might
go
to
Snowfield
,
and
learn
whether
the
last
best
hope
that
had
been
born
to
him
must
be
resigned
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
The
work
he
had
to
do
at
home
,
besides
putting
on
his
best
clothes
,
made
it
seven
before
he
was
on
his
way
again
to
the
Hall
Farm
,
and
it
was
questionable
whether
,
with
his
longest
and
quickest
strides
,
he
should
be
there
in
time
even
for
the
roast
beef
,
which
came
after
the
plum
pudding
,
for
Mrs.
Poyser
's
supper
would
be
punctual
.
  
<EOS>
Great
was
the
clatter
of
knives
and
pewter
plates
and
tin
cans
when
Adam
entered
the
house
,
but
there
was
no
hum
of
voices
to
this
accompaniment
<EOS>
:
the
eating
of
excellent
roast
beef
,
provided
free
of
expense
,
was
too
serious
a
business
to
those
good
farm
-
labourers
to
be
performed
with
a
divided
attention
,
even
if
they
had
had
anything
to
say
to
each
other
 
which
they
had
not
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Poyser
,
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
was
too
busy
with
his
carving
to
listen
to
Bartle
Massey
's
or
Mr.
Craig
's
ready
talk
.
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
Adam
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
standing
and
looking
on
to
see
that
Molly
and
Nancy
did
their
duty
as
waiters
,
"
here
's
a
place
kept
for
you
between
Mr.
Massey
and
the
boys
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
poor
tale
<EOS>
you
could
n't
come
to
see
the
pudding
when
it
was
whole
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
looked
anxiously
round
for
a
fourth
woman
's
figure
,
but
Dinah
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
He
was
almost
afraid
of
asking
about
her
;
besides
,
his
attention
was
claimed
by
greetings
,
and
there
remained
the
hope
that
Dinah
was
in
the
house
,
though
perhaps
disinclined
to
festivities
on
the
eve
of
her
departure
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
goodly
sight
 
that
table
,
with
Martin
Poyser
's
round
good
-
humoured
face
and
large
person
at
the
head
of
it
helping
his
servants
to
the
fragrant
roast
beef
and
pleased
when
the
empty
plates
came
again
.
<EOS>
Martin
,
though
usually
blest
with
a
good
appetite
,
really
forgot
to
finish
his
own
beef
to
-
night
 
<EOS>
it
was
so
pleasant
to
him
to
look
on
in
the
intervals
of
carving
and
see
how
the
others
enjoyed
their
supper
;
for
were
they
not
men
who
,
on
all
the
days
of
the
year
except
Christmas
Day
and
Sundays
,
ate
their
cold
dinner
,
in
a
makeshift
manner
,
under
the
hedgerows
,
and
drank
their
beer
out
of
wooden
bottles
 
with
relish
certainly
,
but
with
their
mouths
towards
the
zenith
,
after
a
fashion
more
endurable
to
ducks
than
to
human
bipeds
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
had
some
faint
conception
of
the
flavour
such
men
must
find
in
hot
roast
beef
and
fresh
-
drawn
ale
.
<EOS>
He
held
his
head
on
one
side
and
screwed
up
his
mouth
,
as
he
nudged
Bartle
Massey
,
and
watched
half
-
witted
Tom
Tholer
,
otherwise
known
as
"
Tom
Saft
,
"
receiving
his
second
plateful
of
beef
.
<EOS>
A
grin
of
delight
broke
over
Tom
's
face
as
the
plate
was
set
down
before
him
,
between
his
knife
and
fork
,
which
he
held
erect
,
as
if
they
had
been
sacred
tapers
.
<EOS>
But
the
delight
was
too
strong
to
continue
smouldering
in
a
grin
 
<EOS>
it
burst
out
the
next
instant
in
a
long
-
drawn
"
haw
,
haw
!
"
<EOS>
followed
by
a
sudden
collapse
into
utter
gravity
,
as
the
knife
and
fork
darted
down
on
the
prey
.
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
's
large
person
shook
with
his
silent
unctuous
laugh
.
<EOS>
He
turned
towards
Mrs.
Poyser
to
see
if
she
too
had
been
observant
of
Tom
,
and
the
eyes
of
husband
and
wife
met
in
a
glance
of
good
-
natured
amusement
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tom
Saft
"
was
a
great
favourite
on
the
farm
,
where
he
played
the
part
of
the
old
jester
,
and
made
up
for
his
practical
deficiencies
by
his
success
in
repartee
.
<EOS>
His
hits
,
I
imagine
,
were
those
of
the
flail
,
which
falls
quite
at
random
,
but
nevertheless
smashes
an
insect
now
and
then
.
<EOS>
They
were
much
quoted
at
sheep
-
shearing
and
haymaking
times
,
but
I
refrain
from
recording
them
here
,
lest
Tom
's
wit
should
prove
to
be
like
that
of
many
other
bygone
jesters
eminent
in
their
day
 
rather
of
a
temporary
nature
,
not
dealing
with
the
deeper
and
more
lasting
relations
of
things
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
excepted
,
Martin
Poyser
had
some
pride
in
his
servants
and
labourers
,
thinking
with
satisfaction
that
they
were
the
best
worth
their
pay
of
any
set
on
the
estate
.
<EOS>
There
was
Kester
Bale
,
for
example
(
Beale
,
probably
,
if
the
truth
were
known
,
but
he
was
called
Bale
,
and
was
not
conscious
of
any
claim
to
a
fifth
letter
)
,
the
old
man
with
the
close
leather
cap
and
the
network
of
wrinkles
on
his
sun
-
browned
face
.
<EOS>
Was
there
any
man
in
Loamshire
who
knew
better
the
"
natur
"
of
all
farming
work
?
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
those
invaluable
labourers
who
can
not
only
turn
their
hand
to
everything
,
but
excel
in
everything
they
turn
their
hand
to
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
<EOS>
Kester
's
knees
were
much
bent
outward
by
this
time
,
and
he
walked
with
a
perpetual
curtsy
,
as
if
he
were
among
the
most
reverent
of
men
.
<EOS>
And
so
he
was
;
but
I
am
obliged
to
admit
that
the
object
of
his
reverence
was
his
own
skill
,
towards
which
he
performed
some
rather
affecting
acts
of
worship
.
<EOS>
He
always
thatched
the
ricks
 
for
if
anything
were
his
forte
more
than
another
,
it
was
thatching
 
and
when
the
last
touch
had
been
put
to
the
last
beehive
rick
,
Kester
,
whose
home
lay
at
some
distance
from
the
farm
,
would
take
a
walk
to
the
rick
-
yard
in
his
best
clothes
on
a
Sunday
morning
and
stand
in
the
lane
,
at
a
due
distance
,
to
contemplate
his
own
thatching
,
walking
about
to
get
each
rick
from
the
proper
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
As
he
curtsied
along
,
with
his
eyes
upturned
to
the
straw
knobs
imitative
of
golden
globes
at
the
summits
of
the
beehive
ricks
,
which
indeed
were
gold
of
the
best
sort
,
you
might
have
imagined
him
to
be
engaged
in
some
pagan
act
of
adoration
.
<EOS>
Kester
was
an
old
bachelor
and
reputed
to
have
stockings
full
of
coin
,
concerning
which
his
master
cracked
a
joke
with
him
<EOS>
every
pay
-
night
:
not
a
new
unseasoned
joke
,
but
a
good
old
one
<EOS>
,
that
had
been
tried
many
times
before
and
had
worn
well
.
<EOS>
"
Th
'
young
measter
's
a
merry
mon
,
"
Kester
frequently
remarked
;
for
having
begun
his
career
by
frightening
away
the
crows
under
the
last
Martin
Poyser
but
one
,
he
could
never
cease
to
account
the
reigning
Martin
a
young
master
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
ashamed
of
commemorating
old
Kester
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
are
indebted
to
the
hard
hands
of
such
men
 
hands
that
have
long
ago
mingled
with
the
soil
they
tilled
so
faithfully
,
thriftily
making
the
best
they
could
of
the
earth
's
fruits
,
and
receiving
the
smallest
share
as
their
own
wages
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
at
the
end
of
the
table
,
opposite
his
master
,
there
was
Alick
,
the
shepherd
and
head
-
man
,
with
the
ruddy
face
and
broad
shoulders
,
not
on
the
best
terms
with
old
Kester
;
indeed
,
their
intercourse
was
confined
to
an
occasional
snarl
,
for
though
they
probably
differed
little
concerning
hedging
and
ditching
and
the
treatment
of
ewes
,
there
was
a
profound
difference
of
opinion
between
them
as
to
their
own
respective
merits
.
<EOS>
When
Tityrus
and
Meliboeus
happen
to
be
on
the
same
farm
,
they
are
not
sentimentally
polite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
Alick
,
indeed
,
was
not
by
any
means
a
honeyed
man
.
<EOS>
His
speech
had
usually
something
of
a
snarl
in
it
,
and
his
broad
-
shouldered
aspect
something
of
the
bull
-
dog
expression
 
"
Do
n't
you
meddle
with
me
,
and
I
wo
n't
meddle
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
was
honest
even
to
the
splitting
of
an
oat
-
grain
rather
than
he
would
take
beyond
his
acknowledged
share
,
and
as
"
close
-
fisted
"
with
his
master
's
property
as
if
it
had
been
<EOS>
his
own
 
throwing
very
small
handfuls
of
damaged
barley
to
the
chickens
,
because
a
large
handful
affected
his
imagination
painfully
with
a
sense
of
profusion
.
<EOS>
Good
-
tempered
Tim
,
the
waggoner
,
who
loved
his
horses
,
had
his
grudge
against
Alick
in
the
matter
of
corn
.
<EOS>
They
rarely
spoke
to
each
other
,
and
never
looked
at
each
other
,
even
over
their
dish
of
cold
potatoes
;
but
then
,
as
this
was
their
usual
mode
of
behaviour
towards
all
mankind
,
it
would
be
an
unsafe
conclusion
that
they
had
more
than
transient
fits
of
unfriendliness
.
<EOS>
The
bucolic
character
at
Hayslope
,
you
perceive
,
was
not
of
that
entirely
genial
,
merry
,
broad
-
grinning
sort
,
apparently
observed
in
most
districts
visited
by
artists
.
<EOS>
The
mild
radiance
of
a
smile
was
a
rare
sight
on
a
field
-
labourer
's
face
,
and
there
was
seldom
any
gradation
between
bovine
gravity
and
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
every
labourer
so
honest
as
our
friend
Alick
.
<EOS>
At
this
very
table
,
among
Mr.
Poyser
's
men
,
there
is
that
big
Ben
Tholoway
,
a
very
powerful
thresher
,
but
detected
more
than
once
in
carrying
away
his
master
's
corn
in
his
pockets
 
an
action
which
,
as
Ben
was
not
a
philosopher
,
could
hardly
be
ascribed
to
absence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
However
,
his
master
had
forgiven
him
,
and
continued
to
employ
him
,
for
the
Tholoways
had
lived
on
the
Common
time
out
of
mind
,
and
had
always
worked
for
the
Poysers
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
whole
,
I
daresay
,
society
was
not
much
the
worse
because
Ben
had
not
six
months
of
it
at
the
treadmill
,
for
his
views
of
depredation
were
narrow
,
and
the
House
of
Correction
might
have
enlarged
them
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
Ben
ate
his
roast
beef
to
-
night
with
a
serene
sense
of
having
stolen
nothing
more
than
a
few
peas
and
beans
as
seed
for
his
garden
since
the
last
harvest
supper
,
and
felt
warranted
in
thinking
that
Alick
's
suspicious
eye
,
for
ever
upon
him
,
was
an
injury
to
his
innocence
.
  
<EOS>
But
NOW
the
roast
beef
was
finished
and
the
cloth
was
drawn
,
leaving
a
fair
large
deal
table
for
the
bright
drinking
-
cans
,
and
the
foaming
brown
jugs
,
and
the
bright
brass
candlesticks
,
pleasant
to
behold
.
<EOS>
NOW
,
the
great
ceremony
of
the
evening
was
to
begin
 
the
harvest
-
song
,
in
which
every
man
must
join
.
<EOS>
He
might
be
in
tune
,
if
he
liked
to
be
singular
,
but
he
must
not
sit
with
closed
lips
.
<EOS>
The
movement
was
obliged
to
be
in
triple
time
;
the
rest
was
ad
libitum
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
the
origin
of
this
song
 
whether
it
came
in
its
actual
state
from
the
brain
of
a
single
rhapsodist
,
or
was
gradually
perfected
by
a
school
or
succession
of
rhapsodists
,
I
am
ignorant
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
stamp
of
unity
,
of
individual
genius
upon
it
,
which
inclines
me
to
the
former
hypothesis
,
though
I
am
not
blind
to
the
consideration
that
this
unity
may
rather
have
arisen
from
that
consensus
of
many
minds
which
was
a
condition
of
primitive
thought
,
foreign
to
our
modern
consciousness
.
<EOS>
Some
will
perhaps
think
that
they
detect
in
the
first
quatrain
an
indication
of
a
lost
line
,
which
later
rhapsodists
,
failing
in
imaginative
vigour
,
have
supplied
by
the
feeble
device
of
iteration
.
<EOS>
Others
,
however
,
may
rather
maintain
that
this
very
iteration
is
an
original
felicity
,
to
which
none
but
the
most
prosaic
minds
can
be
insensible
.
  
<EOS>
The
ceremony
connected
with
the
song
was
a
drinking
ceremony
.
<EOS>
(
That
is
perhaps
a
painful
fact
,
but
then
,
you
know
,
we
can
not
reform
our
forefathers
.
)
<EOS>
During
the
first
and
second
quatrain
,
sung
decidedly
forte
,
no
can
was
filled
.
       
<EOS>
Here
's
a
health
unto
our
master
,
     
<EOS>
The
founder
of
the
feast
;
     
<EOS>
Here
's
a
health
unto
our
master
     
<EOS>
And
to
our
mistress
!
       
<EOS>
And
may
his
doings
prosper
,
     
<EOS>
Whate'er
<EOS>
he
takes
in
hand
,
     
<EOS>
For
we
are
all
his
servants
,
     
And
are
at
his
command
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
immediately
before
the
third
quatrain
or
chorus
,
sung
fortissimo
,
with
emphatic
raps
of
the
table
,
which
gave
the
effect
of
cymbals
and
drum
together
,
Alick
's
can
was
filled
,
and
he
was
bound
to
empty
it
before
the
chorus
ceased
.
       
<EOS>
Then
drink
,
boys
,
drink
!
     
<EOS>
And
see
ye
do
not
spill
,
     
<EOS>
For
if
ye
do
,
ye
shall
drink
two
,
     
<EOS>
For
'
tis
our
master
's
will
.
  
<EOS>
When
Alick
had
gone
successfully
through
this
test
of
steady
-
handed
manliness
,
it
was
the
turn
of
old
Kester
,
at
his
right
hand
 
<EOS>
and
so
on
,
till
every
man
had
drunk
his
initiatory
pint
under
the
stimulus
of
the
chorus
.
<EOS>
Tom
Saft
 
<EOS>
the
rogue
 
took
care
to
spill
a
little
by
accident
;
but
Mrs.
Poyser
(
too
officiously
,
Tom
thought
)
interfered
to
prevent
the
exaction
of
the
penalty
.
  
<EOS>
To
any
listener
outside
the
door
it
would
have
been
the
reverse
of
obvious
why
the
"
Drink
,
boys
,
drink
!
"
<EOS>
should
have
such
an
immediate
and
often
-
repeated
encore
;
but
once
entered
,
he
would
have
seen
that
all
faces
were
at
present
sober
,
and
most
of
them
serious
 
<EOS>
it
was
the
regular
and
respectable
thing
for
those
excellent

Bartle
Massey
,
whose
ears
were
rather
sensitive
,
had
gone
out
to
see
what
sort
of
evening
it
was
at
an
early
stage
in
the
ceremony
,
and
had
not
finished
his
contemplation
until
a
silence
of
five
minutes
declared
that
"
Drink
,
boys
,
drink
!
"
<EOS>
was
not
likely
to
begin
again
for
the
next
twelvemonth
.
<EOS>
Much
to
the
regret
of
the
boys
and
Totty
:
on
them
the
stillness
fell
rather
flat
,
after
that
glorious
thumping
of
the
table
,
towards
which
Totty
,
seated
on
her
father
's
knee
,
contributed
with
her
small
might
and
small
fist
.
  
<EOS>
When
Bartle
re
-
entered
,
however
,
there
appeared
to
be
a
general
desire
for
solo
music
after
the
choral
.
<EOS>
Nancy
declared
that
Tim
the
waggoner
knew
a
song
and
was
"
allays
singing
like
a
lark
<EOS>
i
'
the
stable
,
"
whereupon
Mr.
Poyser
said
encouragingly
,
"
<EOS>
Come
,
Tim
,
lad
,
let
's
hear
it
.
"
<EOS>
Tim
looked
sheepish
,
tucked
down
his
head
,
and
said
he
could
n't
sing
,
but
this
encouraging
invitation
of
the
master
's
was
echoed
all
round
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
conversational
opportunity
:
everybody
could
say
,
"
Come
,
Tim
,
"
except
Alick
,
who
never
relaxed
into
the
frivolity
of
unnecessary
speech
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Tim
's
next
neighbour
,
Ben
Tholoway
,
began
to
give
emphasis
to
his
speech
by
nudges
,
at
which
Tim
,
growing
rather
savage
,
said
,
"
Let
me
alooan
,
will
ye
?
<EOS>
Else
I
'll
ma
'
ye
sing
a
toon
ye
wonna
like
.
"
<EOS>
A
good
-
tempered
waggoner
's
patience
has
limits
,
and
Tim
was
not
to
be
urged
further
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
then
,
David
,
ye're
the
lad
to
sing
,
"
said
Ben
,
willing
to
show
that
he
was
not
discomfited
by
this
check
.
<EOS>
"
Sing
"
My
loove
's
a
roos
wi'out
a
thorn
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
The
amatory
David
was
a
young
man
of
an
unconscious
abstracted
expression
,
which
was
due
probably
to
a
squint
of
superior
intensity
rather
than
to
any
mental
characteristic
;
for
he
was
not
indifferent
to
Ben
's
invitation
,
but
blushed
and
laughed
and
rubbed
his
sleeve
over
his
mouth
in
a
way
that
was
regarded
as
a
symptom
of
yielding
.
<EOS>
And
for
some
time
the
company
appeared
to
be
much
in
earnest
about
the
desire
to
hear
David
's
song
.
<EOS>
But
in
vain
.
<EOS>
The
lyricism
of
the
evening
was
in
the
cellar
at
present
,
and
was
not
to
be
drawn
from
that
retreat
just
yet
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
conversation
at
the
head
of
the
table
had
taken
a
political
turn
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
was
not
above
talking
politics
occasionally
,
though
he
piqued
himself
rather
on
a
wise
insight
than
on
specific
information
.
<EOS>
He
saw
so
far
beyond
the
mere
facts
of
a
case
that
really
it
was
superfluous
to
know
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'm
<EOS>
no
reader
o
'
<EOS>
the
paper
myself
,
"
he
observed
to
-
night
,
as
he
filled
his
pipe
,
"
though
I
might
read
it
fast
enough
if
I
liked
,
for
there
's
<EOS>
Miss
Lyddy
has
'em
and
's
done
with
'em
<EOS>
i
'
no
time
.
<EOS>
But
there
's
Mills
,
now
,
sits
<EOS>
i
'
the
chimney
-
corner
and
reads
the
paper
pretty
nigh
from
morning
to
night
,
and
when
he
's
got
to
th
'
end
<EOS>
on't
<EOS>
he
's
more
addle
-
headed
than
he
was
at
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
He
's
full
o
'
<EOS>
this
peace
now
,
as
they
talk
on
;
he
's
been
reading
and
reading
,
and
thinks
he
's
got
to
the
bottom
on't
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
Lor
'
bless
you
,
Mills
,
"
says
I
,
"
you
see
no
more
into
this
thing
nor
you
can
see
into
the
middle
of
a
potato
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
it
is
:
you
think
it
'll
be
a
fine
thing
for
the
country
.
<EOS>
And
I
'm
not
again
'
<EOS>
it
 
mark
my
words
 
<EOS>
I
'm
not
again
'
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
my
opinion
as
there
's
them
at
the
head
o
'
<EOS>
this
country
as
are
worse
enemies
to
us
nor
Bony
and
all
the
mounseers
he
's
got
at
<EOS>
's
back
;
for
as
for
the
mounseers
,
you
may
skewer
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
'em
at
once
as
if
they
war
frogs
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Martin
Poyser
,
listening
with
an
air
of
much
intelligence
and
edification
,
"
they
ne'er
ate
a
bit
o
'
beef
<EOS>
i
'
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Mostly
sallet
,
I
reckon
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
says
I
to
Mills
,
"
continued
Mr.
Craig
,
"
"
Will
you
try
to
make
me
believe
as
furriners
like
them
can
do
us
half
th
'
harm
<EOS>
them
ministers
do
with
their
bad
government
?
<EOS>
If
King
George

ud
turn
'em
all
away
and
govern
by
himself
,
he
'd
see
everything
righted
.
<EOS>
He
might
take
on
Billy
Pitt
again
if
he
liked
;
but
I
do
n't
see
myself
what
we
want
wi
'
anybody
besides
King
and
Parliament
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
nest
o
'
ministers
does
the
mischief
,
I
tell
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
it
's
fine
talking
,
"
observed
Mrs.
Poyser
,
who
was
now
seated
near
her
husband
,
with
Totty
on
her
lap
 
<EOS>
"
it
's
fine
talking
.
<EOS>
It
's
hard
work
to
tell
which
is
Old
Harry
when
everybody
's
got
boots
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
for
this
peace
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
turning
his
head
on
one
side
in
a
dubitative
manner
and
giving
a
precautionary
puff
to
his
pipe
between
each
sentence
,
"
I
do
n't
know
.
<EOS>
Th
'
war
's
a
fine
thing
for
the
country
,
an
'
how
'll
you
keep
up
prices
wi'out
<EOS>
it
?
<EOS>
An
'
them
French

a
wicked
sort
o

folks
,
by
what
I
can
make
out
.
<EOS>
What
can
you
do
better
nor
fight

em
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ye're
partly
right
there
,
Poyser
,
"
said
Mr.
Craig
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
'm
not
again
'
the
peace
 
to
make
a
holiday
for
a
bit
.
<EOS>
We
can
break
it
when
we
like
,
an
'
I
'm
in
no

<EOS>
o
'
Bony
,
for
all
they
talk
so
much
<EOS>
o
'
his
cliverness
.
<EOS>
That
's
what
I
says
to
Mills
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Lor
'
bless
you
,
he
sees
no
more
through
Bony!
...
<EOS>
why
,
I
put
him
up
to
more
in
three
minutes
than
he
gets
from
's
paper
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
Says
I
,
"
Am
I
a
gardener

his
business
,

<EOS>

"
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure

Craig

"
says
he
 
<EOS>
he
's
not
a
bad
fellow
,
Mills
is
n't
,
for
a
butler
,
but
weak
i
'
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
says
I
,
"
you
talk
o
'
Bony
's
cliverness
;
would
it
be
any
use
my
being
a
first
-
rate
gardener
if
I
'd
got
nought
but
a
quagmire
to
work
on

"
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
"
I
says
,
"
that
's
just
what
it
is
wi
'
Bony
.
<EOS>
I
'll
not
deny
but
he
may
be
a
bit
cliver
 
<EOS>
he
's
no
Frenchman
born
,
as
I
understand
 
<EOS>
but
what
's
he
got
at
<EOS>
's
back
but
mounseers
?
"
<EOS>
"
  
Mr.
Craig
paused
a
moment
with
an
emphatic
stare
after
this
triumphant
specimen
of
Socratic
argument
,
and
then
added
,
thumping
the
table
rather
fiercely
,
"
Why
,
it
's
a
sure
thing
 
<EOS>
and
there
's
them
'
ull
bear
witness
to't
 
<EOS>
as
i
'
one
regiment
where
there
was
one
man
a
-
missing
,
they
put
the
regimentals
on
a
big
monkey
,
and
they
fit
him
as
the
shell
fits
the
walnut
,
and
you
could
n't
tell
the
monkey
from
the
mounseers
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
Think
o
'
that
,
now
!
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
impressed
at
once
with
the
political
bearings
of
the
fact
and
with
its
striking
interest
as
an
anecdote
in
natural
history
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Craig
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
that
's
a
little
too
strong
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
believe
that
.
<EOS>
It
's
all
nonsense
about
the
French
being
such
poor
sticks
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
's
seen
'em
in
their
own
country
,
and
he
says
they
've
<EOS>
plenty
o
'
fine
fellows
among
'em
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
knowledge
,
and
contrivances
,
and
manufactures
,
there
's
a
many
things
as
we
're
a
fine
sight
behind
'em
in
.
<EOS>
It
's
poor
foolishness
to
run
down
your
enemies
.
<EOS>
Why
,
Nelson
and
the
rest
of
'em
'
ud
have
no
merit
i
'
beating
'em
,
if
they
were
such
offal
as
folks
pretend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Poyser
looked
doubtfully
at
Mr.
Craig
,
puzzled
by
this
opposition
of
authorities
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
's
testimony
was
not
to
be
disputed
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
Craig
was
a
knowing
fellow
,
and
his
view
was
less
startling
.
<EOS>
Martin
had
never
"
heard
tell
"
of
the
French
being
good
for
much
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Craig
had
found
no
answer
but
such
as
was
implied
in
taking
a
long
draught
of
ale
and
then
looking
down
fixedly
at
the
proportions
of
his
own
leg
,
which
he
turned
a
little
outward
for
that
purpose
,
when
Bartle
Massey
returned
from
the
fireplace
,
where
he
had
been
smoking
his
first
pipe
in
quiet
,
and
broke
the
silence
by
saying
,
as
he
thrust
his
forefinger
into
the
canister
,
"
Why
,
Adam
,
how
happened
you
not
to
be
at
church
on
Sunday
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
that
,
you
rascal
.
<EOS>
The
anthem
went
limping
without
you
.
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
disgrace
your
schoolmaster
in
his
old
age
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
can
tell
you
where
I
was

<EOS>
I
was
in
no
bad
company
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
's
gone
,
Adam
 
gone
to
Snowfield
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
reminded
of
Dinah
for
the
first
time
this
evening
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
'd
ha
'
persuaded
her
better

<EOS>
Nought

hold
her

but
she
must
go
yesterday
forenoon

The
missis

over
it

<EOS>
I
thought
she

no
sperrit
for

harvest
supper

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Poyser
had
thought
of
Dinah
several
times
since
Adam
had
come
in
,
but
she
had
had
"
no
heart
"
to
mention
the
bad
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
Bartle
,
with
an
air
of
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
there
a
woman
concerned
?
<EOS>
Then
I
give
you
up
,
Adam
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
it
's
a
woman
you'n
spoke
well
on

Bartle
,
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
Come
now
,
you
canna
draw
back
;
you
said
once
as
women
wouldna
ha
'
been
a
bad
invention
if
they
'd
all
been
like
Dinah

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
meant
her
voice
,
man
 
<EOS>
I
meant
her
voice
,
that
was
all
,
"
said
Bartle
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
bear
to
hear
her
speak
without
wanting
to
put
wool
in
my
ears
.
<EOS>
As
for
other
things
,
I
daresay
she
's
like
<EOS>
the
rest
o

<EOS>
the
women
 
thinks
two
and
two
'll
come
to
make
five
,
if
she
cries
and
bothers
enough
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
;
"
one
'
ud
think
,
an
'
hear
some
folks
talk
,
as
the
men
war
'
cute
enough
to
count
the
corns
in
a
bag
o

wheat
wi

only
smelling
at
it

<EOS>
They
can

<EOS>
Perhaps
that
's
the
reason
THEY
can
see
<EOS>
so
little
o

this
side
on't

"
  
<EOS>
Martin
Poyser
shook
with
delighted
laughter
and
winked
at
Adam
,
as
much
as
to
say
the
schoolmaster
was
in
for
it
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
said
Bartle
sneeringly
,
"
the
women
are
quick
enough
 
<EOS>
they
're
quick
enough
.
<EOS>
They
know
the
rights
of
a
story
before
they
hear
it
,
and
can
tell
a
man
what
his
thoughts
are
before
he
knows
'em
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Like
enough
,
"
said
Mrs.
Poyser
,
"
for
the
men
are
mostly
so
slow
,
their
thoughts
overrun
'em
,
an
'
they
can
only
catch

by
the
tail

<EOS>
I
can

when
he
outs

<EOS>
Howiver

I

the

foolish

God
Almighty
made
'em
to

the
men

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Match
!
"
said
Bartle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Aye
,
as
vinegar

<EOS>
If
a
man
says
a
word

his

'll
match
it
with
a
contradiction

if
he

his

She
's
such
a
match
as
the

horse

she

the

Mrs.

"

till
her
husband
told

<EOS>
That
's
what
a
man
wants

mostly
;
he
wants
to
make
sure
o

one
fool

<EOS>
But
there
's

so
much

themselves

"
Come

said
Mr.
Poyser
jocosely
,
"

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Craig
,
willing
to
conciliate
Mrs.
Poyser
and
setting
a
high
value
on
his
own
compliments
,
"
I
like
a
cleverish
woman
 
<EOS>
a
woman
o

<EOS>
sperrit
 
a
managing
woman

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
out
there
,
Craig
,
"
said
Bartle
,
dryly
;
"
you
're
out
there
.
<EOS>
You
judge
o
<EOS>
'
your
garden

stuff

a

<EOS>
You
pick
the

for

<EOS>
You
do
n't
value
your
peas
for
their
roots
,
or
your
carrots
for
their
flowers
.
<EOS>
Now
,
that
's
the
way
you
should
choose
women
.
<EOS>
Their
cleverness
'll
never
come
to
much
 
never

to
much
 
<EOS>
but
they
make
excellent
simpletons
,
ripe
and
strong

flavoured
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
dost
say
to
that
?
"
said
Mr.
Poyser
,
throwing
himself
back
and
looking
merrily
at
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Say
!
"
answered
Mrs.
Poyser
,
with
dangerous
fire
kindling
in
her
eye
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
say
as
some
folks
'
tongues
are
like
the
clocks
as
run
on
strikin
'
,
not
to
tell
you
the
time
<EOS>
o
'
the
day
,
but
because
there
's
summat
wrong
<EOS>
i
'
their
own
inside
...
"
  
Mrs.
Poyser
would
probably
have
brought
her
rejoinder
to
a
further
climax
,
if
every
one
's
attention
had
not
at
this
moment
been
called
to
the
other
end
of
the
table
,
where
the
lyricism
,
which
had
at
first
only
manifested
itself
by
David
's
sotto
voce
performance
of
"
My
love
's
a
rose
without
a
thorn
,
"
had
gradually
assumed
a
rather
deafening
and
complex
character
.
<EOS>
Tim
,
thinking
slightly
of
David
's
vocalization
,
was
impelled
to
supersede
that
feeble
buzz
by
a
spirited
commencement
of
"
Three
Merry
Mowers
,
"
but
David
was
not
to
be
put
down
so
easily
,
and
showed
himself
capable
of
a
copious
crescendo
,
which
was
rendering
it
doubtful
whether
the
rose
would
not
predominate
over
the
mowers
,
when
old
Kester
,
with
an
entirely
unmoved
and
immovable
aspect
,
suddenly
set
up
a
quavering
treble
 
as
if
he
had
been
an
alarum
,
and
the
time
was
come
for
him
to
go
off
.
  
<EOS>
The
company
at
Alick
's
end
of
the
table
took
this
form
of
vocal
entertainment
very
much
as
a
matter
of
course
,
being
free
from
musical
prejudices
;
but
Bartle
Massey
laid
down
his
pipe
and
put
his
fingers
in
his
ears
;
and
Adam
,
who
had
been
longing
to
go
ever
since
he
had
heard
Dinah
was
not
in
the
house
,
rose
and
said
he
must
bid
good
-
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
with
you
,
lad
,
"
said
Bartle
;
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
with
you
before
my
ears
are
split
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
go
round
by
the
Common
and
see
you
home
,
if
you
like
,
Mr.
Massey
,
"
said
Adam
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
!
"
said
Bartle
;
"
then
we
can
have
a
bit
<EOS>
o
'
talk
together
.
<EOS>
I
never
get
hold
of
you
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Eh
!
<EOS>
It
's
a
pity
<EOS>
but
you
'd
sit
it
out
,
"
said
Martin
Poyser
.
<EOS>
"
They
'll
all
go
soon
,
for
th
'
missis
niver
lets
'em
stay
past
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
Adam
was
resolute
,
so
the
good
-
nights
were
said
,
and
the
two
friends
turned
out
on
their
starlight
walk
together
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
that
poor
fool
,
Vixen
,
whimpering
for
me
at
home
,
"
said
Bartle
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
bring
her
here
with
me
for
fear
she
should
be
struck
with
Mrs.
Poyser
's
eye
,
and
the
poor
bitch
might
go
limping
for
ever
after
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
never
any
need
to
drive
Gyp
back
,
"
said
Adam
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
He
always
turns
back
of
his
own
head
when
he
finds
out
I
'm
coming
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
"
said
Bartle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
terrible
woman
!
 
<EOS>
made
of
needles

<EOS>
But
I

I

And
he

<EOS>
He
's

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
she
's
a
downright
good
-
natur'd
woman
,
for
all
that
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
and
as
true
as
the
daylight
.
<EOS>
She
's
a
bit
cross
wi
'
the
dogs
when
they
offer
to
come
in
th
'
house
,
but
if
they
depended
on
her
,
she
'd
take
care
and
have
'em
well
fed
.
<EOS>
If
her
tongue
's
keen
,
her
heart
's
tender
:
I
've
seen
that
in
times
o

trouble

<EOS>
She
's
<EOS>
one
o
'
those
women
as
are
better
than
their
word
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well

"
said
Bartle
,
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
say
th
'
apple

n't

<EOS>
The
Meeting
on
the
Hill
  
ADAM
understood
Dinah
's
haste
to
go
away
,
and
drew
hope
rather
than
discouragement
from
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
fearful
lest
the
strength
of
her
feeling
towards
him
should
hinder
her
from
waiting
and
listening
faithfully
for
the
ultimate
guiding
voice
from
within
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
'd
asked
her
to
write
to
me
,
though
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
even
that
might
disturb
her
a
bit
,
perhaps
.
<EOS>
She
wants
to
be
quite
quiet
in
her
old
way
for
a
while
.
<EOS>
And
I
've
no
right
to
be
impatient
and
interrupting
her
with
my
wishes
.
<EOS>
She
's
told
me
what
her
mind
is
,
and
she
's
not
a
woman
to
say
one
thing
and
mean
another
.
<EOS>
I
'll
wait
patiently
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
was
Adam
's
wise
resolution
,
and
it
throve
excellently
for
the
first
two
or
three
weeks
on
the
nourishment
it
got
from
the
remembrance
of
Dinah
's
confession
that
Sunday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
wonderful
amount
of
sustenance
in
the
first
few
words
of
love
.
<EOS>
But
towards
the
middle
of
October
the
resolution
began
to
dwindle
perceptibly
,
and
showed
dangerous
symptoms
of
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
The
weeks
were
unusually
long
:
Dinah
must
surely
have
had
more
than
enough
time
to
make
up
her
mind
.
<EOS>
Let
a
woman
say
what
she
will
after
she
has
once
told
a
man
that
she
loves
him
,
he
is
a
little
too
flushed
and
exalted
with
that
first
draught
<EOS>
she
offers
him
to
care
much
about
the
taste
of
the
second
.
<EOS>
He
treads
the
earth
with
a
very
elastic
step
as
he
walks
away
from
her
,
and
makes
light
of
all
difficulties
.
<EOS>
But
that
sort
of
glow
dies
out
:
memory
gets
sadly
diluted
with
time
,
and
is
not
strong
enough
to
revive
us
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
no
longer
so
confident
as
he
had
been
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
fear
that
perhaps
Dinah
's
old
life
would
have
too
strong
a
grasp
upon
her
for
any
new
feeling
to
triumph
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
not
felt
this
,
she
would
surely
have
written
to
him
to
give
him
some
comfort
;
but
it
appeared
that
she
held
it
right
to
discourage
him
.
<EOS>
As
Adam
's
confidence
waned
,
his
patience
waned
with
it
,
and
he
thought
he
must
write
himself
.
<EOS>
He
must
ask
Dinah
not
to
leave
him
in
painful
doubt
longer
than
was
needful
.
<EOS>
He
sat
up
late
one
night
to
write
her
a
letter
,
but
the
next
morning
he
burnt
it
,
afraid
of
its
effect
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
worse
to
have
a
discouraging
answer
by
letter
than
from
her
own
lips
,
for
her
presence
reconciled
him
to
her
will
.
  
<EOS>
You
perceive
how
it
was
:
<EOS>
Adam
was
hungering
for
the
sight
of
Dinah
,
and
when
that
sort
of
hunger
reaches
a
certain
stage
,
a
lover
is
likely
to
still
it
though
he
may
have
to
put
his
future
in
pawn
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
harm
could
he
do
by
going
to
Snowfield
?
<EOS>
Dinah
could
not
be
displeased
with
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
forbidden
him
to
go
.
<EOS>
She
must
surely
expect
that
he
would
go
before
long
.
<EOS>
By
the
second
Sunday
in
October
this
view
of
the
case
had
become
so
clear
to
Adam
that
he
was
already
on
his
way
to
Snowfield
,
on
horseback
this
time
,
for
his
hours
were
precious
now
,
and
he
had
borrowed
Jonathan
Burge
's
good
nag
for
the
journey
.
  
<EOS>
What
keen
memories
went
along
the
road
with
him
!
<EOS>
He
had
often
been
to
Oakbourne
and
back
since
that
first
journey
to
Snowfield
,
but
beyond
Oakbourne
the
greystone
walls
,
<EOS>
the
broken
country
,
the
meagre
trees
,
seemed
to
be
telling
him
afresh
the
story
of
that
painful
past
which
he
knew
so
well
by
heart
.
<EOS>
But
no
story
is
the
same
to
us
after
a
lapse
of
time
 
or
rather
,
we
who
read
it
are
no
longer
the
same
interpreters
 
and
Adam
<EOS>
this
morning
brought
with
him
new
thoughts
through
that
grey
country
,
thoughts
which
gave
an
altered
significance
to
its
story
of
the
past
.
  
<EOS>
That
is
a
base
and
selfish
,
even
a
blasphemous
,
spirit
which
rejoices
and
is
thankful
over
the
past
evil
that
has
blighted
or
crushed
another
,
because
it
has
been
made
a
source
of
unforeseen
good
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Adam
could
never
cease
to
mourn
over
that
mystery
of
human
sorrow
which
had
been
brought
so
close
to
him
;
he
could
never
thank
God
for
another
's
misery
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
were
capable
of
that
narrow
-
sighted
joy
in
Adam
's
behalf
,
I
should
still
know
he
was
not
the
man
to
feel
it
for
himself
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
shaken
his
head
at
such
a
sentiment
and
said
,
"
Evil
's
evil
,
and
sorrow
's
sorrow
,
and
you
ca
n't
alter
it
's
natur
by
wrapping
it
up
in
other
words
.
<EOS>
Other
folks
were
not
created
for
my
sake
,
that
I
should
think
all
square
when
things
turn
out
well
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
ignoble
to
feel
that
the
fuller
life
which
a
sad
experience
has
brought
us
is
worth
our
own
personal
share
of
pain
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
is
not
possible
to
feel
otherwise
,
any
more
than
it
would
be
possible
for
a
man
with
cataract
to
regret
the
painful
process
by
which
his
dim
blurred
sight
of
men
as
trees
walking
had
been
exchanged
for
clear
outline
and
effulgent
day
.
<EOS>
The
growth
of
higher
feeling
within
us
is
like
the
growth
of
faculty
,
bringing
with
it
a
sense
of
added
strength
.
<EOS>
We
can
no
more
wish
to
return
to
a
narrower
sympathy
than
a
painter
or
a
musician
can
wish
to
return
to
his
cruder
manner
,
or
a
philosopher
to
his
less
complete
formula
.
  
<EOS>
Something
like
this
sense
of
enlarged
being
was
in
Adam
's
mind
this
Sunday
morning
,
as
he
rode
along
in
vivid
recollection
of
the
past
.
<EOS>
His
feeling
towards
Dinah
,
the
hope
of
passing
his
life
with
her
,
had
been
the
distant
unseen
point
towards
which
that
hard
journey
from
Snowfield
eighteen
months
ago
had
been
leading
him
.
<EOS>
Tender
and
deep
as
his
love
for
Hetty
had
been
 
so
deep
that
the
roots
of
it
would
never
be
torn
away
 
<EOS>
his
love
for
Dinah
was
better
and
more
precious
to
him
,
for
it
was
the
outgrowth
of
that
fuller
life
which
had
come
to
him
from
his
acquaintance
with
deep
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
like
as
if
it
was
a
new
strength
to
me
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
to
love
her
and
know
as
she
loves
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
look
t
'
her
to
help
me
to
see
things
right
.
<EOS>
For
she
's
better
than
I
am
 
<EOS>
there
's
less
o
'
self
in
her
,
and
pride
.
<EOS>
And
it
's
a
feeling
as
gives
you
a
sort
o
'
liberty
,
as
if
you
could
walk
more
fearless
,
when
you
've
more
trust
in
another
than
y
'
have
in
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
've
always
been
thinking
I
knew
better
than
them
as
belonged
to
me
,
and
that
's
a
poor
sort
o
'
<EOS>
life
,
when
you
ca
n't
look
to
them
nearest
to
you
t
'
help
you
with
a
bit
better
thought
than
what
you
've
got
inside
you
a'ready
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
when
Adam
came
in
sight
of
the
grey
town
on
the
hill
-
side
and
looked
searchingly
towards
the
green
valley
below
,
for
the
first
glimpse
of
the
old
thatched
roof
near
the
ugly
red
mill
.
<EOS>
The
scene
looked
less
harsh
in
the
soft
October
sunshine
than
it
had
in
the
eager
time
of
early
spring
,
and
the
one
grand
charm
it
possessed
in
common
with
all
wide
-
stretching
woodless
regions
 
that
it
filled
you
with
a
new
consciousness
of
the
overarching
sky
 
had
a
milder
,
more
soothing
influence
than
usual
,
on
this
almost
cloudless
day
.
<EOS>
Adam
's
doubts
and
fears
melted
under
this
influence
as
the
delicate
weblike
clouds
had
gradually
melted
away
into
the
clear
blue
above
him
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
see
Dinah
's
gentle
face
assuring
him
,
with
its
looks
alone
,
of
all
he
longed
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
expect
Dinah
to
be
at
home
at
this
hour
,
but
he
got
down
from
his
horse
and
tied
it
at
the
little
gate
,
that
he
might
ask
where
she
was
gone
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
had
set
his
mind
on
following
her
and
bringing
her
home
.
<EOS>
She
was
gone
to
Sloman
's
End
,
a
hamlet
about
three
miles
off
,
over
the
hill
,
the
old
woman
told
him
 
had
set
off
directly
after
morning
chapel
,
to
preach
in
a
cottage
there
,
as
her
habit
was
.
<EOS>
Anybody
at
the
town
would
tell
him
the
way
to
Sloman
's
End
.
<EOS>
So
Adam
got
on
his
horse
again
and
rode
to
the
town
,
putting
up
at
the
old
inn
and
taking
a
hasty
dinner
there
in
the
company
of
the
too
chatty
landlord
,
from
whose
friendly
questions
and
reminiscences
he
was
glad
to
escape
as
soon
as
possible
and
set
out
towards
Sloman
's
End
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
haste
it
was
nearly
four
o'clock
before
he
could
set
off
,
and
he
thought
that
as
Dinah
had
gone
so
early
,
she
would
perhaps
already
be
near
returning
.
<EOS>
The
little
,
grey
,
desolate
-
looking
hamlet
,
unscreened
by
sheltering
trees
,
lay
in
sight
long
before
he
reached
it
,
and
as
he
came
near
he
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
singing
a
hymn
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Perhaps
that
's
the
last
hymn
before
they
come
away
,
"
Adam
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
walk
back
a
bit
and
turn
again
to
meet
her
,
farther
off
the
village
.
"
<EOS>
He
walked
back
till
he
got
nearly
to
the
top
of
the
hill
again
,
and
seated
himself
on
a
loose
stone
,
against
the
low
wall
,
to
watch
till
he
should
see
the
little
black
figure
leaving
the
hamlet
and
winding
up
the
hill
.
<EOS>
He
chose
this
spot
,
almost
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
because
it
was
away
from
all
eyes
 
<EOS>
no
house
,
no
cattle
,
not
even
a
nibbling
sheep
near
 
no
presence
but
the
still
lights
and
shadows
and
the
great
embracing
sky
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
much
longer
coming
than
he
expected
.
<EOS>
He
waited
an
hour
at
least
watching
for
her
and
thinking
of
her
,
while
the
afternoon
shadows
lengthened
and
the
light
grew
softer
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
saw
the
little
black
figure
coming
from
between
the
grey
houses
and
gradually
approaching
the
foot
of
the
hill
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
Adam
thought
,
but
Dinah
was
really
walking
at
her
usual
pace
,
with
a
light
quiet
step
.
<EOS>
Now
she
was
beginning
to
wind
along
the
path
up
the
hill
,
but
Adam
would
not
move
yet
;
he
would
not
meet
her
too
soon
;
he
had
set
his
heart
on
meeting
her
in
this
assured
loneliness
.
<EOS>
And
now
he
began
to
fear
lest
he
should
startle
her
too
much
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
,
"
he
thought
,
"
she
's
not
one
to
be
overstartled
;
she
's
always
so
calm
and
quiet
,
as
if
she
was
prepared
for
anything
.
"
  
<EOS>
What
was
she
thinking
of
as
she
wound
up
the
hill
?
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
had
found
complete
repose
without
him
,
and
had
ceased
to
feel
any
need
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
On
the
verge
of
a
decision
we
all
tremble
:
hope
pauses
with
fluttering
wings
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
at
last
she
was
very
near
,
and
Adam
rose
from
the
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
It
happened
that
just
as
he
walked
forward
,
Dinah
had
paused
and
turned
round
to
look
back
at
the
village
 
who
does
not
pause
and
look
back
in
mounting
a
hill
?
<EOS>
Adam
was
glad
,
for
,
with
the
fine
instinct
of
a
lover
,
he
felt
that
it
would
be
best
for
her
to
hear
his
voice
before
she
saw
him
.
<EOS>
He
came
within
three
paces
of
her
and
then
said
,
"
Dinah
!
"
<EOS>
She
started
without
looking
round
,
as
if
she
connected
the
sound
with
no
place
.
"
<EOS>
Dinah
!
"
<EOS>
Adam
said
again
.
<EOS>
He
knew
quite
well
what
was
in
her
mind
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
accustomed
to
think
of
impressions
as
purely
spiritual
monitions
that
she
looked
for
no
material
visible
accompaniment
of
the
voice
.
  
<EOS>
But
this
second
time
she
looked
round
.
<EOS>
What
a
look
of
yearning
love
it
was
that
the
mild
grey
eyes
turned
on
the
strong
dark
-
eyed
man
!
<EOS>
She
did
not
start
again
at
the
sight
of
him
;
she
said
nothing
,
but
moved
towards
him
so
that
his
arm
could
clasp
her
round
.
  
<EOS>
And
they
walked
on
so
in
silence
,
while
the
warm
tears
fell
.
<EOS>
Adam
was
content
,
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
It
was
Dinah
who
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
Adam
,
"
she
said
,
"
it
is
the
Divine
Will
.
<EOS>
My
soul
is
so
knit
to
yours
that
it
is
but
<EOS>
a
divided
life
I
live
without
you
.
<EOS>
And
this
moment
,
now
you
are
with
me
,
and
I
feel
that
our
hearts
are
filled
with
the
same
love
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
fulness
of
strength
to
bear
and
do
our
heavenly
Father
's
Will
that
I
had
lost
before
.
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
paused
and
looked
into
her
sincere
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
'll
never
part
any
more
,
Dinah
,
till
death
parts
us
.
"
  
<EOS>
And
they
kissed
each
other
with
a
deep
joy
.
  
<EOS>
What
greater
thing
is
there
for
two
human
souls
than
to
feel
that
they
are
joined
for
life
 
to
strengthen
each
other
in
all
labour
,
to
rest
on
each
other
in
all
sorrow
,
to
minister
to
each
other
in
all
pain
,
to
be
one
with
each
other
in
silent
unspeakable
memories
at
the
moment
of
the
last
parting
?

Marriage
Bells
  
<EOS>
IN
little
more
than
a
month
after
that
meeting
on
the
hill
 
on
a
rimy
morning
in
departing
November
 
Adam
and
Dinah
were
married
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
an
event
much
thought
of
in
the
village
.
<EOS>
All
Mr.
Burge
's
men
had
a
holiday
,
and
all
Mr.
Poyser
's
,
and
most
of
those
who
had
a
holiday
appeared
in
their
best
clothes
at
the
wedding
.
<EOS>
I
think
there
was
hardly
an
inhabitant
of
Hayslope
specially
mentioned
in
this
history
and
still
resident
in
the
parish
on
this
November
morning
who
was
not
either
in
church
to
see
Adam
and
Dinah
married
,
or
near
the
church
door
to
greet
them
as
they
came
forth
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Irwine
and
her
daughters
were
waiting
at
the
churchyard
gates
in
their
carriage
(
for
they
had
a
carriage
now
)
to
shake
hands
with
the
bride
and
bridegroom
and
wish
them
well
;
and
in
the
absence
of
Miss
Lydia
Donnithorne
at
Bath
,
Mrs.
Best
,
Mr.
Mills
,
and
Mr.
Craig
had
felt
it
incumbent
on
them
to
represent
"
the
family
"
at
the
Chase
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
churchyard
walk
was
quite
lined
with
familiar
faces
,
many
of
them
faces
that
had
first
looked
at
Dinah
when
she
preached
on
the
Green
.
<EOS>
And
no
wonder
they
showed
this
eager
interest
on
her
marriage
morning
,
for
nothing
like
Dinah
and
the
history
which
had
brought
her
and
<EOS>
Adam
Bede
together
had
been
known
at
Hayslope
within
the
memory
of
man
.
  
<EOS>
Bessy
Cranage
,
in
her
neatest
cap
and
frock
,
was
crying
,
though
she
did
not
exactly
know
why
;
for
,
as
her
cousin
Wiry
Ben
,
who
stood
near
her
,
judiciously
suggested
,
Dinah
was
not
going
away
,
and
if
Bessy
was
in
low
spirits
,
the
best
thing
for
her
to
do
was
to
follow
Dinah
's
example
and
marry
an
honest
fellow
who
was
ready
to
have
her
.
<EOS>
Next
to
Bessy
,
just
within
the
church
door
,
there
were
the
Poyser
children
,
peeping
round
the
corner
of
the
pews
to
get
a
sight
of
the
mysterious
ceremony
;
Totty
's
face
wearing
an
unusual
air
of
anxiety
at
the
idea
of
seeing
cousin
Dinah
come
back
looking
rather
old
,
for
in
Totty
's
experience
no
married
people
were
young
.
  
<EOS>
I
envy
them
all
the
sight
they
had
when
the
marriage
was
fairly
ended
and
Adam
led
Dinah
out
of
church
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
in
black
this
morning
,
for
her
Aunt
Poyser
would
by
no
means
allow
such
a
risk
of
incurring
bad
luck
,
and
had
herself
made
a
present
of
the
wedding
dress
,
made
all
of
grey
,
though
in
the
usual
Quaker
form
,
for
on
this
point
Dinah
could
not
give
way
.
<EOS>
So
the
lily
face
looked
out
with
sweet
gravity
from
under
a
grey
Quaker
bonnet
,
neither
smiling
nor
blushing
,
but
with
lips
trembling
a
little
under
the
weight
of
solemn
feelings
.
<EOS>
Adam
,
as
he
pressed
her
arm
to
his
side
,
walked
with
his
old
erectness
and
his
head
thrown
rather
backward
as
if
to
face
all
the
world
better
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
because
he
was
particularly
proud
this
morning
,
as
is
the
wo
nt
of
bridegrooms
,
for
his
happiness
was
of
a
kind
that
had
little
reference
to
men
's
opinion
of
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
tinge
of
sadness
in
his
deep
joy
;
Dinah
knew
it
,
and
did
not
feel
aggrieved
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
three
other
couples
,
following
the
bride
and
bridegroom
:
first
,
Martin
Poyser
,
looking
as
cheery
as
a
bright
fire
on
this
rimy
morning
,
led
quiet
Mary
Burge
,
the
bridesmaid
;
then
came
Seth
serenely
happy
,
with
Mrs.
Poyser
on
his
arm
;
and
last
of
all
Bartle
Massey
,
with
Lisbeth
 
Lisbeth
in
a
new
gown
and
bonnet
,
too
busy
with
her
pride
in
her
son
and
her
delight
in
possessing
the
one
daughter
she
had
desired
to
devise
a
single
pretext
for
complaint
.
  
<EOS>
Bartle
Massey
had
consented
to
attend
the
wedding
at
Adam
's
earnest
request
,
under
protest
against
marriage
in
general
and
the
marriage
of
a
sensible
man
in
particular
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Mr.
Poyser
had
a
joke
against
him
after
the
wedding
dinner
,
to
the
effect
that
in
the
vestry
he
had
given
the
bride
one
more
kiss
than
was
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
Behind
this
last
couple
came
Mr.
Irwine
,
glad
at
heart
over
this
good
morning
's
work
of
joining
Adam
and
Dinah
.
<EOS>
For
he
had
seen
Adam
in
the
worst
moments
of
his
sorrow
;
and
what
better
harvest
from
that
painful
seed
-
time
could
there
be
than
this
?
<EOS>
The
love
that
had
brought
hope
and
comfort
in
the
hour
of
despair
,
the
love
that
had
found
its
way
to
the
dark
prison
cell
and
to
poor
Hetty
's
darker
soul
 
<EOS>
this
strong
gentle
love
was
to
be
Adam
's
companion
and
helper
till
death
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
much
shaking
of
hands
mingled
with
"
God
bless
you
's
"
and
other
good
wishes
to
the
four
couples
,
at
the
churchyard
gate
,
Mr.
Poyser
answering
for
the
rest
with
unwonted
vivacity
of
tongue
,
for
he
had
all
the
appropriate
wedding
-
day
jokes
at
his
command
.
<EOS>
And
the
women
,
he
observed
,
could
never
do
anything
but
put
finger
in
eye
at
a
wedding
.
<EOS>
Even
Mrs.
Poyser
could
not
trust
herself
to
speak
as
the
neighbours
shook
hands
with
her
,
and
Lisbeth
began
to
cry
in
the
face
of
the
very
first
person
who
told
her
she
was
getting
young
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Joshua
Rann
,
having
a
slight
touch
of
rheumatism
,
did
not
join
in
the
ringing
of
the
bells
this
morning
,
and
,
looking
on
with
some
contempt
at
these
informal
greetings
which
required
no
official
co
-
operation
from
the
clerk
,
began
to
hum
in
his
musical
bass
,
"
Oh
what
a
joyful
thing
it
is
,
"
by
way
of
preluding
a
little
to
the
effect
he
intended
to
produce
in
the
wedding
psalm
next
Sunday
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
bit
of
good
news
to
cheer
Arthur
,
"
said
Mr.
Irwine
to
his
mother
,
as
they
drove
off
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
write
to
him
the
first
thing
when
we
get
home
.
"
    
<EOS>
IT
is
near
the
end
of
June
,
in
1807
.
<EOS>
The
workshops
have
been
shut
up
half
an
hour
or
more
in
Adam
Bede
's
timber
-
yard
,
which
used
to
be
Jonathan
Burge
's
,
and
<EOS>
the
mellow
evening
light
is
falling
on
the
pleasant
house
with
the
buff
walls
and
the
soft
grey
thatch
,
very
much
as
it
did
when
we
saw
Adam
bringing
in
the
keys
on
that
June
evening
nine
years
ago
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
figure
we
know
<EOS>
well
,
just
come
out
of
the
house
,
and
shading
her
eyes
with
her
hands
as
she
looks
for
something
in
the
distance
,
for
the
rays
that
fall
on
her
white
borderless
cap
and
her
pale
auburn
hair
are
very
dazzling
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
turns
away
from
the
sunlight
and
looks
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
We
can
see
the
sweet
pale
face
quite
well
now
:
it
is
scarcely
at
all
altered
 
only
a
little
fuller
,
to
correspond
to
her
more
matronly
figure
,
which
still
seems
light
and
active
enough
in
the
plain
black
dress
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
him
,
Seth
,
"
Dinah
said
,
as
she
looked
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
go
and
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Lisbeth
,
come
with
Mother
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
last
call
was
answered
immediately
by
a
small
fair
creature
with
pale
auburn
hair
and
grey
eyes
,
little
more
than
four
years
old
,
who
ran
out
silently
and
put
her
hand
into
her
mother
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Uncle
Seth
,
"
said
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
aye
,
we
're
coming
,
"
<EOS>
Seth
answered
from
within
,
and
presently
appeared
stooping
under
the
doorway
,
being
taller
than
usual
by
the
black
head
of
a
sturdy
two
-
year
-
old
nephew
,
who
had
caused
some
delay
by
demanding
to
be
carried
on
uncle
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Better
take
him
on
thy
arm
,
Seth
,
"
said
Dinah
,
looking
fondly
at
the
stout
black
-
eyed
fellow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
troublesome
to
thee
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
nay
:
<EOS>
Addy
likes
a
ride
on
my
shoulder
.
<EOS>
I
can
carry
him
so
for
a
bit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
kindness
which
young
Addy
acknowledged
by
drumming
his
heels
with
promising
force
against
Uncle
Seth
's
chest
.
<EOS>
But
to
walk
by
Dinah
's
side
,
and
be
tyrannized
over
by
Dinah
's
and
Adam
's
children
,
was
Uncle
Seth
's
earthly
happiness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
didst
see
him
?
"
asked
Seth
,
as
they
walked
on
into
the
adjoining
field
.
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
catch
sight
of
him
anywhere
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Between
the
hedges
by
the
roadside
,
"
said
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
I
saw
his
hat
and
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
There
he
is
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Trust
thee
for
catching
sight
of
him
if
he
's
anywhere
to
be
seen
,
"
said
Seth
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thee't
like
poor
mother
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
She
was
always
on
the
look
out
for
Adam
,
and
could
see
him
sooner
than
other
folks
,
for
all
her
eyes
got
dim
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
's
been
longer
than
he
expected
,
"
said
Dinah
,
taking
Arthur
's
watch
from
a
small
side
pocket
and
looking
at
it
;
"
it
's
nigh
upon
seven
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
,
they
'd
have
a
deal
to
say
to
one
another
,
"
said
Seth
,
"
and
<EOS>
the
meeting
'
ud
touch
'em
both
pretty
closish
.
<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
getting
on
towards
eight
years
since
they
parted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
said
Dinah
,
"
Adam
was
greatly
moved
this
morning
at
the
thought
of
the
change
he
should
see
in
the
poor
young
man
,
from
the
sickness
he
has
undergone
,
as
well
as
the
years
which
have
changed
us
all
.
<EOS>
And
the
death
of
the
poor
wanderer
,
when
she
was
coming
back
to
us
,
has
been
sorrow
upon
sorrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
See
,
Addy
,
"
said
Seth
,
lowering
the
young
one
to
his
arm
now
and
pointing
,
"
there
's
Father
coming
 
at
the
far
stile
.
"
  
<EOS>
Dinah
hastened
her
steps
,
and
little
Lisbeth
ran
on
at
her
utmost
speed
till
she
clasped
her
father
's
leg
.
<EOS>
Adam
patted
her
head
and
lifted
her
up
to
kiss
her
,
but
Dinah
could
see
the
marks
of
agitation
on
his
face
as
she
approached
him
,
and
he
put
her
arm
within
his
in
silence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
youngster
,
must
I
take
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
trying
to
smile
,
when
Addy
stretched
out
his
arms
 
ready
,
with
the
usual
baseness
of
infancy
,
to
give
up
his
Uncle
Seth
at
once
,
now
there
was
some
rarer
patronage
at
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
cut
me
a
good
deal
,
Dinah
,
"
Adam
said
at
last
,
when
they
were
walking
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
Didst
find
him
greatly
altered
?
"
said
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
he
's
altered
and
yet
not
altered
.
<EOS>
I
should
ha
'
known
him
anywhere
.
<EOS>
But
his
colour
's
changed
,
and
he
looks
sadly
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
doctors
say
he
'll
soon
be
set
right
in
his
own
country
air
.
<EOS>
He
's
all
sound
in
th
'
inside
;
it
's
only
the
fever
shattered
him
so
.
<EOS>
But
he
speaks
just
the
same
,
and
smiles
at
me
just
as
he
did
when
he
was
a
lad
.
<EOS>
It
's
wonderful
how
he
's
always
had
just
the
same
sort
<EOS>
o
'
look
when
he
smiles
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
've
never
seen
him
smile
,
poor
young
man
,
"
said
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
thee
wilt
see
him
smile
,
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Adam
.
"
<EOS>
He
asked
after
thee
the
first
thing
when
he
began
to
come
round
,
and
we
could
talk
to
one
another
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
she
is
n't
altered
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
remember
her
face
so
well
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
him
"
no
,
"
"
Adam
continued
,
looking
fondly
at
the
eyes
that
were
turned
towards
his
,
"
only
a
bit
plumper
,
as
thee'dst
a
right
to
be
after
seven
year
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
come
and
see
her
to
-
morrow
,
may
n't
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
I
long
to
tell
her
how
I
've
thought
of
her
all
these
years
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Didst
tell
him
I
'd
always
used
the
watch
?
"
said
Dinah
.
  
<EOS>
"
Aye
;
and
we
talked
a
deal
about
thee
,
for
he
says
he
never
saw
a
woman
a
bit
like
thee
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
turn
Methodist
some
day
,
"
he
said
,
"
when
she
preaches
out
of
doors
,
and
go
to
hear
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
said
,
"
Nay
,
sir
,
you
ca
n't
do
that
,
for
Conference
has
forbid
the
women
preaching
,
and
she
's
given
it
up
,
all
but
talking
to
the
people
a
bit
in
their
houses
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
,
"
said
Seth
,
who
could
not
repress
a
comment
on
this
point
,
"
and
a
sore
pity
<EOS>
it
was
o
'
Conference
;
and
if
Dinah
had
seen
as
I
did
,
we
'd
ha
'
left
the
Wesleyans
and
joined
a
body
that
'
ud
put
no
bonds
on
Christian
liberty
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nay
,
lad
,
nay
,
"
said
Adam
,
"
she
was
right
and
thee
wast
wrong
.
<EOS>
There
's
no
rules
so
wise
<EOS>
but
what
it
's
a
pity
for
somebody
or
other
.
<EOS>
Most
o
'
the
women
do
more
harm
nor
good
with
their
preaching
 
<EOS>
they
've
not
got
Dinah
's
gift
nor
her
sperrit
 
<EOS>
and
she
's
seen
that
,
<EOS>
and
she
thought
it
right
to
set
th
'
example
o
'
submitting
,
for
she
's
not
held
from
other
sorts
o
'
teaching
.
<EOS>
And
I
agree
with
her
,
and
approve
o
'
what
she
did
.
"
  
<EOS>
Seth
was
silent
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
standing
subject
of
difference
rarely
alluded
to
,
and
Dinah
,
wishing
to
quit
it
at
once
,
said
,
"
Didst
remember
,
Adam
,
to
speak
to
Colonel
Donnithorne
the
words
my
uncle
and
aunt
entrusted
to
thee
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
and
he
's
going
to
the
Hall
Farm
with
Mr.
Irwine
the
day
after
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
came
in
while
we
were
talking
about
it
,
and
he
would
have
it
as
the
Colonel
must
see
nobody
but
thee
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
He
said
 
and
he
's
in
the
right
of
it
 
as
it
'll
be
bad
for
him
<EOS>
t
'
have
his
feelings
stirred
with
seeing
many
people
one
after
another
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
get
you
strong
and
hearty
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
's
the
first
thing
to
be
done
Arthur
,
and
then
you
shall
have
your
own
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
keep
you
under
your
old
tutor
's
thumb
till
then
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Irwine
's
fine
and
joyful
at
having
him
home
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Adam
was
silent
a
little
while
,
and
then
said
,
"
It
was
very
cutting
when
we
first
saw
one
another
.
<EOS>
He
'd
never
heard
about
poor
Hetty
till
Mr.
Irwine
met
him
in
London
,
for
the
letters
missed
him
on
his
journey
.
<EOS>
The
first
thing
he
said
to
me
,
when
we
'd
got
hold
o
'
<EOS>
one
<EOS>
another
's
hands
was
,
'
I
could
never
do
anything
for
her
,
Adam
 
<EOS>
she
lived
long
enough
for
all
the
suffering
 
<EOS>
and
I
'd
thought
so
of
the
time
when
I
might
do
something
for
her
.
<EOS>
But
you
told
me
the
truth
when
you
said
to
me
once
,
"
There
's
a
sort
of
wrong
that
can
never
be
made
up
for
.
"
'
"
  
"
Why
,
there
's
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Poyser
coming
in
at
the
yard
gate
,
"
said
Seth
.
  
<EOS>
"
So
there
is
,
"
said
Dinah
.
<EOS>
"
Run
,
Lisbeth
,
run
to
meet
Aunt
Poyser
.
<EOS>
Come
in
,
Adam
,
and
rest
;
it
has
been
a
hard
day
for
thee
.
"
   
<EOS>
