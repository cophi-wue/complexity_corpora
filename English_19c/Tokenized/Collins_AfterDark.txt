PREFACE
TO
"
<EOS>
AFTER
DARK
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
have
taken
some
pains
to
string
together
the
various
stories
contained
in
this
Volume
on
a
single
thread
of
interest
,
<EOS>
which
,
so
far
as
I
know
,
has
at
least
the
merit
of
not
having
been
used
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
pages
entitled
"
Leah
's
Diary
"
are
,
however
,
intended
to
fulfill
another
purpose
besides
that
of
serving
as
the
frame
-
work
for
my
collection
of
tales
.
<EOS>
In
this
part
of
the
book
,
and
subsequently
in
the
Prologues
to
the
stories
,
it
has
been
my
object
to
give
the
reader
one
more
glimpse
at
that
artist
-
life
which
circumstances
have
afforded
me
peculiar
opportunities
of
studying
,
and
which
I
have
already
tried
to
represent
,
under
another
aspect
,
in
my
fiction
,
"
Hide
-
and
-
Seek
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
time
I
wish
to
ask
some
sympathy
for
the
joys
and
sorrows
of
a
poor
traveling
portrait
-
painter
 
presented
from
his
wife
's
point
of
view
in
"
Leah
's
Diary
,
"
and
supposed
to
be
briefly
and
simply
narrated
by
himself
in
the
Prologues
to
the
stories
.
<EOS>
I
have
purposely
kept
these
two
portions
of
the
book
within
certain
limits
;
only
giving
,
in
the
one
case
,
as
much
as
the
wife
might
naturally
write
in
her
diary
at
intervals
of
household
leisure
;
and
,
in
the
other
,
as
much
as
a
modest
and
sensible
man
would
be
likely
to
say
about
himself
and
about
the
characters
he
met
with
in
his
wanderings
.
<EOS>
If
I
have
been
so
fortunate
as
to
make
my
idea
intelligible
by
this
brief
and
simple
mode
of
treatment
,
and
if
I
have
,
at
the
same
time
,
achieved
the
necessary
object
of
gathering
several
separate
stories
together
as
neatly
-
fitting
parts
of
one
complete
whole
,
I
shall
have
succeeded
in
a
design
which
I
have
for
some
time
past
been
very
anxious
creditably
to
fulfill
.
 
<EOS>
Of
the
tales
themselves
,
taken
individually
,
I
have
only
to
say
,
by
way
of
necessary
explanation
,
that
"
The
Lady
of
Glenwith
Grange
"
is
now
offered
to
the
reader
for
the
first
time
;
and
that
the
other
stories
have
appeared
in
the
columns
of
Household
Words
.
<EOS>
My
best
thanks
are
due
to
Mr.
Charles
Dickens
for
his
kindness
in
allowing
me
to
set
them
in
their
present
frame
-
work
.
 
<EOS>
I
must
also
gratefully
acknowledge
an
obligation
of
another
kind
to
the
accomplished
artist
,
Mr.
W.
S.
Herrick
,
to
whom
I
am
indebted
for
the
curious
and
interesting
facts
on
which
the
tales
of
"
The
Terribly
Strange
Bed
"
and
"
The
Yellow
Mask
"
are
founded
.
 
<EOS>
Although
the
statement
may
appear
somewhat
superfluous
to
those
who
know
me
,
it
may
not
be
out
of
place
to
add
,
in
conclusion
,
that
these
stories
are
entirely
of
my
own
imagining
,
constructing
,
and
writing
.
<EOS>
The
fact
that
the
events
of
some
of
my
tales
occur
on
foreign
ground
,
and
are
acted
out
by
foreign
personages
,
appears
to
have
suggested
in
some
quarters
the
inference
that
the
stories
themselves
might
be
of
foreign
origin
.
<EOS>
Let
me
,
once
for
all
,
assure
any
readers
who
may
honor
me
with
their
attention
,
that
in
this
,
and
in
all
other
cases
,
they
may
depend
on
the
genuineness
of
my
literary
offspring
.
<EOS>
The
little
children
of
my
brain
may
be
weakly
enough
,
and
may
be
sadly
in
want
of
a
helping
hand
to
aid
them
in
their
first
attempts
at
walking
on
the
stage
of
this
great
world
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
they
are
not
borrowed
children
.
<EOS>
The
members
of
my
own
literary
family
are
indeed
increasing
so
fast
as
to
render
the
very
idea
of
borrowing
quite
out
of
the
question
,
and
to
suggest
serious
apprehension
that
I
may
not
have
done
adding
to
the
large
book
-
population
,
on
my
own
sole
responsibility
,
even
yet
.

<EOS>
LEAVES
FROM
LEAH
'S
DIARY
.
  
<EOS>
26th
February
,
1827
.
 
<EOS>
The
doctor
has
just
called
for
the
third
time
to
examine
my
husband
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
there
is
no
fear
at
present
of
my
poor
William
losing
his
sight
,
provided
he
can
be
prevailed
on
to
attend
rigidly
to
the
medical
instructions
for
preserving
it
.
<EOS>
These
instructions
,
which
forbid
him
to
exercise
his
profession
for
the
next
six
months
at
least
,
are
,
in
our
case
,
very
hard
to
follow
.
<EOS>
They
will
but
too
probably
sentence
us
to
poverty
,
perhaps
to
actual
want
;
but
they
must
be
borne
resignedly
,
and
even
thankfully
,
seeing
that
my
husband
's
forced
cessation
from
work
will
save
him
from
the
dreadful
affliction
of
loss
of
sight
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
can
answer
for
my
own
cheerfulness
and
endurance
,
now
that
we
know
the
worst
.
<EOS>
Can
I
answer
for
our
children
also
?
<EOS>
Surely
I
can
,
when
there
are
only
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
sad
confession
to
make
,
but
now
,
for
the
first
time
since
my
marriage
,
I
feel
thankful
that
we
have
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
17th
.
 
<EOS>
A
dread
came
over
me
last
night
,
after
I
had
comforted
William
as
well
as
I
could
about
the
future
,
and
had
heard
him
fall
off
to
sleep
,
that
the
doctor
had
not
told
us
the
worst
.
<EOS>
Medical
men
do
sometimes
deceive
their
patients
,
from
what
has
always
seemed
to
me
to
be
misdirected
kindness
of
heart
.
<EOS>
The
mere
suspicion
that
I
had
been
trifled
with
on
the
subject
of
my
husband
's
illness
,
caused
me
such
uneasiness
,
that
I
made
an
excuse
to
get
out
,
and
went
in
secret
to
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
,
I
found
him
at
home
,
and
in
three
words
I
confessed
to
him
the
object
of
my
visit
.
  
<EOS>
He
smiled
,
and
said
I
might
make
myself
easy
;
he
had
told
us
the
worst
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
that
worst
,
"
I
said
,
to
make
certain
,
"
is
,
that
for
the
next
six
months
my
husband
must
allow
his
eyes
to
have
the
most
perfect
repose
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
the
doctor
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
I
do
n't
say
that
he
may
not
dispense
with
his
green
shade
,
indoors
,
for
an
hour
or
two
at
a
time
,
as
the
inflammation
gets
subdued
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
most
positively
repeat
that
he
must
not
employ
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
must
not
touch
a
brush
or
pencil
;
he
must
not
think
of
taking
another
likeness
,
on
any
consideration
<EOS>
whatever
,
for
the
next
six
months
.
<EOS>
His
persisting
in
finishing
those
two
portraits
,
at
the
time
when
his
eyes
first
began
to
fail
,
was
the
real
cause
of
all
the
bad
symptoms
that
we
have
had
to
combat
ever
since
.
<EOS>
I
warned
him
(
if
you
remember
,
Mrs.
Kerby
?
)
<EOS>
when
he
first
came
to
practice
in
our
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
did
,
sir
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
was
a
poor
traveling
portrait
-
painter
like
my
husband
,
who
lives
by
taking
likenesses
first
in
one
place
and
then
in
another
,
to
do
?
<EOS>
Our
bread
depended
on
his
using
his
eyes
,
at
the
very
time
when
you
warned
him
to
let
them
have
a
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
no
other
resources
?
<EOS>
No
money
but
the
money
Mr.
Kerby
can
get
by
portrait
-
painting
?
"
asked
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
I
answered
,
with
a
sinking
at
my
heart
as
I
thought
of
his
bill
for
medical
attendance
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
pardon
me
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
coloring
and
looking
a
little
uneasy
,
"
or
,
rather
,
will
you
ascribe
it
to
the
friendly
interest
I
feel
in
you
,
if
I
ask
whether
Mr.
Kerby
realizes
a
comfortable
income
by
the
practice
of
his
profession
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
,
"
he
went
on
anxiously
,
before
I
could
reply
 
"
pray
do
n't
think
I
make
this
inquiry
from
a
motive
of
impertinent
curiosity
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
quite
satisfied
that
he
could
have
no
improper
motive
for
asking
the
question
,
and
so
answered
it
at
once
plainly
and
truly
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
husband
makes
but
a
small
income
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
Famous
London
portrait
-
painters
get
great
prices
from
their
sitters
;
but
poor
unknown
artists
,
who
only
travel
about
the
country
,
are
obliged
to
work
hard
and
be
contented
with
very
small
gains
.
<EOS>
After
we
have
paid
all
that
we
owe
here
,
I
am
afraid
we
shall
have
little
enough
left
to
retire
on
,
when
we
take
refuge
in
some
cheaper
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
that
case
,
"
said
the
good
doctor
(
I
am
so
glad
and
proud
to
remember
that
I
always
liked
him
from
the
first
!
)
,
"
in
that
case
,
do
n't
make
yourself
anxious
about
my
bill
when
you
are
thinking
of
clearing
off
your
debts
here
.
<EOS>
I
can
afford
to
wait
till
Mr.
Kerby
's
eyes
are
well
again
,
and
I
shall
then
ask
him
for
a
likeness
of
my
little
daughter
.
<EOS>
By
that
arrangement
we
are
sure
to
be
both
quits
,
and
both
perfectly
satisfied
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
considerately
shook
hands
and
bade
me
farewell
before
I
could
say
half
the
grateful
words
to
him
that
were
on
my
lips
.
<EOS>
Never
,
never
shall
I
forget
that
he
relieved
me
of
my
two
heaviest
anxieties
at
the
most
anxious
time
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
The
merciful
,
warm
-
hearted
man
!
<EOS>
I
could
almost
have
knelt
down
and
kissed
his
doorstep
,
as
I
crossed
it
on
my
way
home
.
  
<EOS>
18th
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
not
resolved
,
after
what
happened
yesterday
,
to
look
only
at
the
cheerful
side
of
things
for
the
future
,
the
events
of
to
-
day
would
have
robbed
me
of
all
my
courage
,
at
the
very
outset
of
our
troubles
.
<EOS>
First
,
there
was
the
casting
up
of
our
bills
,
and
the
discovery
,
when
the
amount
of
them
was
balanced
against
all
the
money
we
have
saved
up
,
that
we
shall
only
have
between
three
and
four
pounds
left
in
the
cash
-
box
,
after
we
have
got
out
of
debt
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
sad
necessity
of
writing
letters
in
my
husband
's
name
to
the
rich
people
who
were
ready
to
employ
him
,
telling
them
of
the
affliction
that
had
overtaken
him
,
and
of
the
impossibility
of
his
executing
their
orders
for
portraits
for
the
next
six
months
to
come
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
there
was
the
heart
-
breaking
business
for
me
to
go
through
of
giving
our
landlord
warning
,
just
as
we
had
got
comfortably
settled
in
our
new
abode
.
<EOS>
If
William
could
only
have
gone
on
with
his
work
,
we
might
have
stopped
in
this
town
,
and
in
these
clean
,
comfortable
lodgings
for
at
least
three
or
four
months
.
<EOS>
We
have
never
had
the
use
of
a
nice
empty
garret
before
,
for
the
children
to
play
in
;
and
I
never
met
with
any
landlady
so
pleasant
to
deal
with
in
the
kitchen
as
the
landlady
here
.
<EOS>
And
now
we
must
leave
all
this
comfort
and
happiness
,
and
go
 
<EOS>
I
hardly
know
where
.
<EOS>
William
,
in
his
bitterness
,
says
to
the
workhouse
;
but
that
shall
never
be
,
if
I
have
to
go
out
to
service
to
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
is
coming
on
,
and
we
must
save
in
candles
,
or
I
could
write
much
more
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
me
!
<EOS>
what
a
day
this
has
been
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
but
<EOS>
one
pleasant
moment
since
it
began
;
and
that
was
in
the
morning
,
when
I
set
my
little
Emily
to
work
on
a
bead
purse
for
the
kind
doctor
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
My
child
,
young
as
she
is
,
is
wonderfully
neat
-
handed
at
stringing
beads
;
and
even
a
poor
little
empty
purse
as
a
token
of
our
gratitude
,
is
better
than
nothing
at
all
.
  
<EOS>
19th
.
 
<EOS>
A
visit
from
our
best
friend
 
our
only
friend
here
 
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
examined
William
's
eyes
,
and
had
reported
that
they
were
getting
on
as
well
as
can
be
hoped
at
present
,
he
asked
where
we
thought
of
going
to
live
?
<EOS>
I
said
in
the
cheapest
place
we
could
find
,
and
added
that
I
was
about
to
make
inquiries
in
the
by
-
streets
of
the
town
that
very
day
.
<EOS>
"
Put
off
those
inquiries
,
"
he
said
,
"
till
you
hear
from
me
again
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
now
to
see
a
patient
at
a
farmhouse
five
miles
off
.
<EOS>
(
You
need
n't
look
at
the
children
,
Mrs.
Kerby
,
it
's
nothing
infectious
 
only
a
clumsy
lad
,
who
has
broken
his
collarbone
by
a
fall
from
a
horse
.
)
<EOS>
They
receive
lodgers
occasionally
at
the
farmhouse
,
and
I
know
no
reason
why
they
should
not
be
willing
to
receive
you
.
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
be
well
housed
and
well
fed
at
a
cheap
rate
,
and
if
you
like
the
society
of
honest
,
hearty
people
,
the
farm
of
Appletreewick
is
the
very
place
for
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
thank
me
till
you
know
whether
I
can
get
you
these
new
lodgings
or
not
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
meantime
settle
all
your
business
affairs
here
,
so
as
to
be
able
to
move
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
words
the
kind
-
hearted
gentleman
nodded
and
went
out
.
<EOS>
Pray
heaven
he
may
succeed
at
the
farmhouse
!
<EOS>
We
may
be
sure
of
the
children
's
health
,
at
least
,
if
we
live
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
the
children
,
I
must
not
omit
to
record
that
Emily
has
nearly
done
one
end
of
the
bead
purse
already
.
  
<EOS>
20th
.
 
<EOS>
A
note
from
the
doctor
,
who
is
too
busy
to
call
.
<EOS>
Such
good
news
!
<EOS>
They
will
give
us
two
bedrooms
,
and
board
us
with
the
family
at
Appletreewick
for
seventeen
shillings
a
week
.
<EOS>
By
my
calculations
,
we
shall
have
three
pounds
sixteen
shillings
left
,
after
paying
what
we
owe
here
.
<EOS>
That
will
be
enough
,
at
the
outset
,
for
four
weeks
'
living
at
the
farmhouse
,
with
eight
shillings
to
spare
besides
.
<EOS>
By
embroidery
-
work
I
can
easily
make
nine
shillings
more
to
put
to
that
,
and
there
is
a
fifth
week
provided
for
.
<EOS>
Surely
,
in
five
weeks
'
time
 
considering
the
number
of
things
I
can
turn
my
hand
to
 
we
may
hit
on
some
plan
for
getting
a
little
money
.
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
am
always
telling
my
husband
,
and
what
,
by
dint
of
constantly
repeating
it
,
I
am
getting
to
believe
myself
.
<EOS>
William
,
as
is
but
natural
,
poor
fellow
,
does
not
take
so
lighthearted
view
of
the
future
as
I
do
.
<EOS>
He
says
that
the
prospect
of
sitting
idle
and
being
kept
by
his
wife
for
months
to
come
,
is
something
more
wretched
and
hopeless
than
words
can
describe
.
<EOS>
I
try
to
raise
his
spirits
by
reminding
him
of
his
years
of
honest
hard
work
for
me
and
the
children
,
and
of
the
doctor
's
assurance
that
his
eyes
will
get
the
better
,
in
good
time
,
of
their
present
helpless
state
.
<EOS>
But
he
still
sighs
and
murmurs
 
being
one
of
the
most
independent
and
high
spirited
of
men
 
about
living
a
burden
on
his
wife
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
answer
,
what
in
my
heart
of
hearts
I
feel
,
that
I
took
him
for
Better
and
for
Worse
;
that
I
have
had
many
years
of
the
Better
,
and
that
,
even
in
our
present
trouble
,
the
Worse
shows
no
signs
of
coming
yet
!
  
<EOS>
The
bead
purse
is
getting
on
fast
.
<EOS>
Red
and
blue
,
in
a
pretty
striped
pattern
.
  
<EOS>
21st
.
 
<EOS>
A
busy
day
.
<EOS>
We
go
to
Appletreewick
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Paying
bills
and
packing
up
.
<EOS>
All
poor
William
's
new
canvases
and
painting
-
things
huddled
together
into
a
packing
-
case
.
<EOS>
He
looked
so
sad
,
sitting
silent
with
his
green
shade
on
,
while
his
old
familiar
working
materials
were
disappearing
around
him
,
as
if
he
and
they
were
never
to
come
together
again
,
that
the
tears
would
start
into
my
eyes
,
though
I
am
sure
I
am
not
one
of
the
crying
sort
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
the
green
shade
kept
him
from
seeing
me
:
and
I
took
good
care
,
though
the
effort
nearly
choked
me
,
that
he
should
not
hear
I
was
crying
,
at
any
rate
.
  
<EOS>
The
bead
purse
is
done
.
<EOS>
How
are
we
to
get
the
steel
rings
and
tassels
for
it
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
justified
now
in
spending
sixpence
unnecessarily
,
even
for
the
best
of
purposes
.
  
<EOS>
22d

<EOS>
23d

<EOS>
The
Farm
of
Appletreewick
.
 
<EOS>
Too
tired
,
after
our
move
yesterday
,
to
write
a
word
in
my
diary
about
our
journey
to
this
delightful
place
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
we
are
beginning
to
get
settled
,
I
can
manage
to
make
up
for
past
omissions
.
  
<EOS>
My
first
occupation
on
the
morning
of
the
move
had
,
oddly
enough
,
nothing
to
do
with
our
departure
for
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
The
moment
breakfast
was
over
<EOS>
I
began
the
day
by
making
Emily
as
smart
and
nice
-
looking
as
I
could
,
to
go
to
the
doctor
's
with
the
purse
.
<EOS>
She
had
her
best
silk
frock
on
,
showing
the
mending
a
little
in
some
places
,
I
am
afraid
,
and
her
straw
hat
trimmed
with
my
bonnet
ribbon
.
<EOS>
Her
father
's
neck
-
scarf
,
turned
and
joined
so
that
nobody
could
see
it
,
made
a
nice
mantilla
for
her
;
and
away
she
went
to
the
doctor
's
,
with
her
little
,
determined
step
,
and
the
purse
in
her
hand
(
such
a
pretty
hand
that
it
is
hardly
to
be
regretted
<EOS>
I
had
no
gloves
for
her
)
.
<EOS>
They
were
delighted
with
the
purse
 
which
I
ought
to
mention
was
finished
with
some
white
beads
;
we
found
them
in
rummaging
among
our
boxes
,
and
they
made
beautiful
rings
and
tassels
,
contrasting
charmingly
with
the
blue
and
red
of
the
rest
of
the
purse
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
and
his
little
girl
were
,
as
I
have
said
,
delighted
with
the
present
;
and
they
gave
Emily
,
in
return
,
a
workbox
for
herself
,
and
a
box
of
sugar
-
plums
for
her
baby
sister
.
<EOS>
The
child
came
back
all
flushed
with
the
pleasure
of
the
visit
,
and
quite
helped
to
keep
up
her
father
's
spirits
with
talking
to
him
about
it
.
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
highly
interesting
history
of
the
bead
purse
.
  
<EOS>
Toward
the
afternoon
the
light
cart
from
the
farmhouse
came
to
fetch
us
and
our
things
to
Appletreewick
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
a
warm
spring
day
,
and
I
had
another
pang
to
bear
as
I
saw
poor
William
helped
into
the
cart
,
looking
so
sickly
and
sad
,
with
his
miserable
green
shade
,
in
the
cheerful
sunlight
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
God
only
knows
,
Leah
,
how
this
will
succeed
with
us
,
"
he
said
,
as
we
started
;
then
sighed
,
and
fell
silent
again
.
  
<EOS>
Just
outside
the
town
the
doctor
met
us
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
luck
go
with
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
swinging
his
stick
in
his
usual
hasty
way
;
"
I
shall
come
and
see
you
as
soon
as
you
are
all
settled
at
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Good
-
by
,
sir
,
"
says
Emily
,
struggling
up
with
all
her
might
among
the
bundles
in
the
bottom
of
the
cart
;
"
good
-
by
,
and
thank
you
again
for
the
work
-
box
and
the
sugar
-
plums
.
<EOS>
"
That
was
my
child
all
over
!
<EOS>
she
never
wants
telling
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
kissed
his
hand
,
and
gave
another
flourish
with
 
his
stick
.
<EOS>
So
we
parted
.
  
<EOS>
How
I
should
have
enjoyed
the
drive
if
William
could
only
have
looked
,
as
I
did
,
at
the
young
firs
on
the
heath
bending
beneath
the
steady
breeze
;
at
the
shadows
flying
over
the
smooth
fields
;
at
the
high
white
clouds
moving
on
and
on
,
in
their
grand
airy
procession
over
the
gladsome
blue
sky
!
<EOS>
It
was
a
hilly
road
,
and
I
begged
the
lad
who
drove
us
not
to
press
the
horse
;
so
we
were
nearly
an
hour
,
at
our
slow
rate
of
going
,
before
we
drew
up
at
the
gate
of
Appletreewick
.
  
<EOS>
24th
February
to
2d
March
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
now
been
here
long
enough
to
know
something
of
the
place
and
the
people
.
<EOS>
First
,
as
to
the
place
:
Where
the
farmhouse
now
is
,
there
was
once
a
famous
priory
.
<EOS>
The
tower
is
still
standing
,
and
the
great
room
where
the
monks
ate
and
drank
 
used
at
present
as
a
granary
.
<EOS>
The
house
itself
seems
to
have
been
tacked
on
to
the
ruins
anyhow
.
<EOS>
No
two
rooms
in
it
are
on
the
same
level
.
<EOS>
The
children
do
nothing
but
tumble
about
the
passages
,
because
there
always
happens
to
be
a
step
up
or
down
,
just
at
the
darkest
part
of
every
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
As
for
staircases
,
there
seems
to
me
to
be
one
for
each
bedroom
.
<EOS>
I
do
nothing
but
lose
my
way
 
and
the
farmer
says
,
drolling
,
that
he
must
have
sign
-
posts
put
up
for
me
in
every
corner
of
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
On
the
ground
-
floor
,
besides
the
usual
domestic
offices
,
we
have
the
best
parlor
 
a
dark
,
airless
,
expensively
furnished
solitude
,
never
invaded
by
anybody
;
the
kitchen
,
and
a
kind
of
hall
,
with
a
fireplace
as
big
as
the
drawing
-
room
at
our
town
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Here
we
live
and
take
our
meals
;
here
the
children
can
racket
about
to
their
hearts
'
content
;
here
the
dogs
come
lumbering
in
,
whenever
they
can
get
loose
;
here
wages
are
paid
,
visitors
are
received
<EOS>
,
bacon
is
cured
,
cheese
is
tasted
,
pipes
are
smoked
,
and
naps
are
taken
every
evening
by
the
male
members
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
Never
was
such
a
comfortable
,
friendly
dwelling
-
place
devised
as
this
hall
;
I
feel
already
as
if
half
my
life
had
been
passed
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
Out
-
of
-
doors
,
looking
beyond
the
flower
-
garden
,
lawn
,
back
yards
,
pigeon
-
houses
,
and
kitchen
-
gardens
<EOS>
,
we
are
surrounded
by
a
network
of
smooth
grazing
-
fields
,
each
shut
off
from
the
other
by
its
neat
hedgerow
and
its
sturdy
gate
.
<EOS>
Beyond
the
fields
the
hills
seem
to
flow
away
gently
from
us
into
the
far
blue
distance
,
till
they
are
lost
in
the
bright
softness
of
the
sky
.
<EOS>
At
one
point
,
which
we
can
see
from
our
bedroom
windows
,
they
dip
suddenly
into
the
plain
,
and
show
,
over
the
rich
marshy
flat
,
a
strip
of
distant
sea
 
<EOS>
a
strip
sometimes
blue
,
sometimes
gray
;
sometimes
,
when
the
sun
sets
,
a
streak
of
fire
;
sometimes
,
on
showery
days
,
a
flash
of
silver
light
.
  
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
the
farmhouse
have
one
great
and
rare
merit
 
<EOS>
they
are
people
whom
you
can
make
friends
with
at
once
.
<EOS>
Between
not
knowing
them
at
all
,
and
knowing
them
well
enough
to
shake
hands
at
first
sight
,
there
is
no
ceremonious
interval
or
formal
gradation
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
They
received
us
,
on
our
arrival
,
exactly
as
if
we
were
old
friends
returned
from
some
long
traveling
expedition
.
<EOS>
Before
we
had
been
ten
minutes
in
the
hall
,
William
had
the
easiest
chair
and
the
snuggest
corner
;
the
children
were
eating
bread
-
and
-
jam
on
the
window
-
seat
;
and
I
was
talking
to
the
farmer
's
wife
,
with
the
cat
on
my
lap
,
of
the
time
when
Emily
had
the
measles
.
  
<EOS>
The
family
numbers
seven
,
exclusive
of
the
indoor
servants
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
First
came
the
farmer
and
his
wife
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
tall
,
sturdy
,
loud
-
voiced
,
active
old
man
 
<EOS>
she
the
easiest
,
plumpest
and
gayest
woman
of
sixty
<EOS>
I
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
They
have
three
sons
and
two
daughters
.
<EOS>
The
two
eldest
of
the
young
men
are
employed
on
the
farm
;
the
third
is
a
sailor
,
and
is
making
holiday
-
time
of
it
just
now
at
Appletreewick
.
<EOS>
The
daughters
are
pictures
of
health
and
freshness
.
<EOS>
I
have
but
one
complaint
to
make
against
them
 
<EOS>
they
are
beginning
to
spoil
the
children
already
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
tranquil
place
,
and
among
these
genial
,
natural
people
,
how
happily
my
time
might
be
passed
,
were
it
not
for
the
saddening
sight
of
William
's
affliction
,
and
the
wearing
uncertainty
of
how
we
are
to
provide
for
future
necessities
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
hard
thing
for
my
husband
and
me
,
after
having
had
the
day
made
pleasant
by
kind
words
and
friendly
offices
,
to
feel
this
one
anxious
thought
always
forcing
itself
on
us
at
night
:
<EOS>
Shall
we
have
the
means
of
stopping
in
our
new
home
in
a
month
's
time
?
  
<EOS>
3d
.
 
<EOS>
A
rainy
day
;
the
children
difficult
to
manage
;
William
miserably
despondent
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
influenced
me
,
or
perhaps
I
felt
my
little
troubles
with
the
children
more
than
usual
:
<EOS>
but
,
however
it
was
,
I
have
not
been
so
heavy
-
hearted
since
the
day
when
my
husband
first
put
on
the
green
shade
.
<EOS>
A
listless
,
hopeless
sensation
would
steal
over
me
;
but
why
write
about
it
?
<EOS>
Better
to
try
and
forget
it
.
<EOS>
There
is
always
to
-
morrow
to
look
to
when
to
-
day
is
at
the
worst
.
  
<EOS>
4th
.
 
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
has
proved
worthy
of
the
faith
I
put
in
it
.
<EOS>
Sunshine
again
out
-
of
-
doors
;
and
as
clear
and
true
a
reflection
of
it
in
my
own
heart
as
I
can
hope
to
have
just
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
month
,
that
one
poor
month
of
respite
!
<EOS>
What
are
we
to
do
at
the
end
of
the
month
?
  
<EOS>
5th
.
 
<EOS>
I
made
my
short
entry
for
yesterday
in
the
afternoon
just
before
tea
-
time
,
little
thinking
of
events
destined
to
happen
with
the
evening
that
would
be
really
worth
chronicling
,
for
the
sake
of
the
excellent
results
to
which
they
are
sure
to
lead
.
<EOS>
My
tendency
is
to
be
too
sanguine
about
everything
,
I
know
;
but
I
am
,
nevertheless
,
firmly
persuaded
that
I
can
see
a
new
way
out
of
our
present
difficulties
 
a
way
of
getting
money
enough
to
keep
us
all
in
comfort
at
the
farmhouse
until
William
's
eyes
are
well
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
new
project
which
is
to
relieve
us
from
all
uncertainties
for
the
next
six
months
actually
originated
with
me
!
<EOS>
It
has
raised
me
many
inches
higher
in
my
own
estimation
already
.
<EOS>
If
the
doctor
only
agrees
with
my
view
of
the
case
when
he
comes
to
-
morrow
,
William
will
allow
himself
to
be
persuaded
,
I
know
;
and
then
let
them
say
what
they
please
,
I
will
answer
for
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
This
is
how
the
new
idea
first
found
its
way
into
my
head
:
  
<EOS>
We
had
just
done
tea
.
<EOS>
William
,
in
much
better
spirits
than
usual
,
was
talking
with
the
young
sailor
,
who
is
jocosely
called
here
by
the
very
ugly
name
of
"
Foul
-
weather
Dick
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
farmer
and
his
two
eldest
sons
were
composing
themselves
on
the
oaken
settles
for
their
usual
nap
.
<EOS>
The
dame
was
knitting
,
the
two
girls
were
beginning
to
clear
the
tea
-
table
,
and
I
was
darning
the
children
's
socks
.
<EOS>
To
all
appearance
,
this
was
not
a
very
propitious
state
of
things
for
the
creation
of
new
ideas
,
and
yet
my
idea
grew
out
of
it
,
for
all
that
.
<EOS>
Talking
with
my
husband
on
various
subjects
connected
with
life
in
ships
,
the
young
sailor
began
giving
us
a
description
of
his
hammock
;
telling
us
how
it
was
slung
;
how
it
was
impossible
to
get
into
it
any
other
way
than
"
stern
foremost
"
(
whatever
that
may
mean
)
;
how
the
rolling
of
the
ship
made
it
rock
like
a
cradle
;
and
how
,
on
rough
nights
,
it
sometimes
swayed
to
and
fro
at
such
a
rate
as
to
bump
bodily
against
the
ship
's
side
and
wake
him
up
with
the
sensation
of
having
just
received
a
punch
on
the
head
from
a
remarkably
hard
fist
.
<EOS>
Hearing
all
this
,
I
ventured
to
suggest
that
it
must
be
an
immense
relief
to
him
to
sleep
on
shore
in
a
good
,
motionless
,
solid
four
-
post
bed
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
my
surprise
,
he
scoffed
at
the
idea
;
said
he
never
slept
comfortably
out
of
his
hammock
;
declared
that
he
quite
missed
his
occasional
punch
on
the
head
from
the
ship
's
side
;
and
ended
by
giving
a
most
comical
account
of
all
the
uncomfortable
sensations
he
felt
when
he
slept
in
a
four
-
post
bed
.
<EOS>
The
odd
nature
of
one
of
the
young
sailor
's
objections
to
sleeping
on
shore
reminded
my
husband
(
as
indeed
it
did
me
too
)
of
the
terrible
story
of
a
bed
in
a
French
gambling
-
house
,
which
he
once
heard
from
a
gentleman
whose
likeness
he
took
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
're
laughing
at
me
,
"
says
honest
Foul
-
weather
Dick
,
seeing
William
turn
toward
me
and
smile
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
indeed
,
"
says
my
husband
;
"
that
last
objection
of
yours
to
the
four
-
post
beds
on
shore
seems
by
no
means
ridiculous
to
me
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
once
knew
a
gentleman
,
Dick
,
who
practically
realized
your
objection
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
"
says
Dick
,
after
a
pause
,
and
with
an
appearance
of
great
bewilderment
and
curiosity
;
"
but
could
you
put
"
practically
realized
"
into
plain
English
,
so
that
a
poor
man
like
me
might
have
a
chance
of
understanding
you
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Certainly
!
"
says
my
husband
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
once
knew
a
gentleman
who
actually
saw
and
felt
what
you
say
in
jest
you
are
afraid
of
seeing
and
feeling
whenever
you
sleep
in
a
four
-
post
bed
.
<EOS>
Do
you
understand
that
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Foul
-
weather
Dick
understood
it
perfectly
,
and
begged
with
great
eagerness
to
hear
what
the
gentleman
's
adventure
really
was
.
<EOS>
The
dame
,
who
had
been
listening
to
our
talk
,
backed
her
son
's
petition
;
the
two
girls
sat
down
expectant
at
the
half
-
cleared
tea
-
table
;
even
the
farmer
and
his
drowsy
sons
roused
themselves
lazily
on
the
settle
 
<EOS>
my
husband
saw
that
he
stood
fairly
committed
to
the
relation
of
the
story
,
so
he
told
it
without
more
ado
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
often
heard
him
relate
that
strange
adventure
<EOS>
(
William
is
the
best
teller
of
a
story
I
ever
met
with
)
to
friends
of
all
ranks
in
many
different
parts
of
England
,
and
I
never
yet
knew
it
fail
of
producing
an
effect
.
<EOS>
The
farmhouse
audience
were
,
I
may
almost
say
,
petrified
by
it
.
<EOS>
I
never
before
saw
people
look
so
long
in
the
same
direction
,
and
sit
so
long
in
the
same
attitude
,
as
they
did
.
<EOS>
Even
the
servants
stole
away
from
their
work
in
the
kitchen
,
and
,
unrebuked
by
master
or
mistress
,
stood
quite
spell
-
bound
in
the
doorway
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Observing
all
this
in
silence
,
while
my
husband
was
going
on
with
his
narrative
,
the
thought
suddenly
flashed
across
me
,
"
Why
should
William
not
get
a
wider
audience
for
that
story
,
as
well
as
for
others
which
he
has
heard
from
time
to
time
from
his
sitters
,
and
which
he
has
hitherto
only
repeated
in
private
among
a
few
friends
?
<EOS>
People
tell
stories
in
books
and
get
money
for
them
.
<EOS>
What
if
we
told
our
stories
in
a
book
?
<EOS>
and
what
if
the
book
sold
?
<EOS>
Why
freedom
,
surely
,
from
the
one
great
anxiety
that
is
now
preying
on
us
!
<EOS>
Money
enough
to
stop
at
the
farmhouse
till
William
's
eyes
are
fit
for
work
again
!
<EOS>
"
I
almost
jumped
up
from
my
chair
as
my
thought
went
on
shaping
itself
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
When
great
men
make
wonderful
discoveries
,
do
they
feel
sensations
like
mine
,
I
wonder
?
<EOS>
Was
Sir
Isaac
Newton
within
an
ace
of
skipping
into
the
air
when
he
first
found
out
the
law
of
gravitation
?
<EOS>
Did
Friar
Bacon
long
to
dance
when
he
lit
the
match
and
heard
the
first
charge
of
gunpowder
in
the
world
go
off
with
a
bang
?
  
<EOS>
I
had
to
put
a
strong
constraint
on
myself
,
or
I
should
have
communicated
all
that
was
passing
in
my
mind
to
William
before
our
friends
at
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
But
I
knew
it
was
best
to
wait
until
we
were
alone
,
and
I
did
wait
.
<EOS>
What
a
relief
it
was
when
we
all
got
up
at
last
to
say
good
-
night
!
  
<EOS>
The
moment
we
were
in
our
own
room
,
I
could
not
stop
to
take
so
much
as
a
pin
out
of
my
dress
before
I
began
.
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
said
I
,
"
I
never
heard
you
tell
that
gambling
-
house
adventure
so
well
before
.
<EOS>
What
an
effect
it
had
upon
our
friends
!
<EOS>
what
an
effect
,
indeed
,
it
always
has
wherever
you
tell
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
So
far
he
did
not
seem
to
take
much
notice
.
<EOS>
He
just
nodded
,
and
began
to
pour
out
some
of
the
lotion
in
which
he
always
bathes
his
poor
eyes
the
last
thing
at
night
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
as
for
that
,
William
,
"
I
went
on
,
"
all
your
stories
seem
to
interest
people
.
<EOS>
What
a
number
you
have
picked
up
,
first
and
last
,
from
different
sitters
,
in
the
fifteen
years
of
your
practice
as
a
portrait
-
painter
!
<EOS>
Have
you
any
idea
<EOS>
how
many
stories
you
really
do
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
No
<EOS>
:
he
could
not
undertake
to
say
how
many
just
then
.
<EOS>
He
gave
this
answer
in
a
very
indifferent
tone
,
dabbing
away
all
the
time
at
his
eyes
with
the
sponge
and
lotion
.
<EOS>
He
did
it
so
awkwardly
and
roughly
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
,
that
I
took
the
sponge
from
him
and
applied
the
lotion
tenderly
myself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
said
I
,
"
if
you
turned
over
one
of
your
stories
carefully
in
your
mind
<EOS>
beforehand
 
say
the
one
you
told
to
-
night
,
for
example
 
that
you
could
repeat
it
all
to
me
so
perfectly
and
deliberately
that
I
should
be
able
to
take
it
down
in
writing
from
your
lips
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Yes
:
of
course
he
could
.
<EOS>
But
why
ask
that
question
?
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
should
like
to
have
all
the
stories
that
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
relating
to
our
friends
set
down
fairly
in
writing
,
by
way
of
preserving
them
from
ever
being
forgotten
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Would
I
bathe
his
left
eye
now
,
because
that
felt
the
hottest
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
I
began
to
forbode
that
his
growing
indifference
to
what
I
was
saying
would
soon
end
in
his
fairly
going
to
sleep
before
I
had
developed
my
new
idea
,
unless
I
took
some
means
forthwith
of
stimulating
his
curiosity
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
of
waking
him
into
a
proper
state
of
astonishment
and
attention
.
<EOS>
"
William
,
"
said
I
,
without
another
syllable
of
preface
,
"
I
have
got
a
new
plan
for
finding
all
the
money
we
want
for
our
expenses
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
jerked
his
head
up
directly
,
and
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
What
plan
?
  
<EOS>
"
This
:
The
state
of
your
eyes
prevents
you
for
the
present
from
following
your
profession
as
an
artist
,
does
it
not
?
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
What
are
you
to
do
with
your
idle
time
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
Turn
author
!
<EOS>
And
how
are
you
to
get
the
money
we
want
?
<EOS>
By
publishing
a
book
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Good
gracious
,
Leah
!
<EOS>
are
you
out
of
your
senses
?
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
.
  
<EOS>
I
put
my
arm
<EOS>
round
his
neck
and
sat
down
on
his
knee
(
the
course
I
always
take
when
I
want
to
persuade
him
to
anything
with
as
few
words
as
possible
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
William
,
listen
patiently
to
me
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
An
artist
lies
under
this
great
disadvantage
in
case
of
accidents
 
<EOS>
his
talents
are
of
no
service
to
him
unless
he
can
use
his
eyes
and
fingers
.
<EOS>
An
author
,
on
the
other
hand
,
can
turn
his
talents
to
account
just
as
well
by
means
of
other
people
's
eyes
and
fingers
as
by
means
of
his
own
.
<EOS>
In
your
present
situation
,
therefore
,
you
have
nothing
for
it
,
as
I
said
before
,
but
to
turn
author
.
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
and
hear
me
out
.
<EOS>
The
book
I
want
you
to
make
is
a
book
of
all
your
stories
.
<EOS>
You
shall
repeat
them
,
and
I
will
write
them
down
from
your
dictation
.
<EOS>
Our
manuscript
shall
be
printed
;
we
will
sell
the
book
to
the
public
,
and
so
support
ourselves
honorably
in
adversity
,
by
doing
the
best
we
can
to
interest
and
amuse
others
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
I
was
saying
all
this
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
in
a
very
excitable
manner
 
my
husband
looked
,
as
our
young
sailor
-
friend
would
phrase
it
,
quite
taken
aback
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
always
quick
at
contriving
,
Leah
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
how
in
the
world
came
you
to
think
of
this
plan
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
of
it
while
you
were
telling
them
the
gambling
-
house
adventure
downstairs
,
"
I
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
an
ingenious
idea
,
and
a
bold
idea
,
"
he
went
on
,
thoughtfully
.
"
<EOS>
But
it
is
one
thing
to
tell
a
story
to
a
circle
of
friends
,
and
another
thing
to
put
it
into
a
printed
form
for
an
audience
of
strangers
.
<EOS>
Consider
,
my
dear
,
that
we
are
neither
of
us
used
to
what
is
called
writing
for
the
press
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
true
,
"
said
I
,
"
but
nobody
is
used
to
it
when
they
first
begin
,
and
yet
plenty
of
people
have
tried
the
hazardous
literary
experiment
successfully
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
in
our
case
,
we
have
the
materials
ready
to
our
hands
;
surely
we
can
succeed
in
shaping
them
presentably
if
we
aim
at
nothing
but
the
simple
truth
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
to
do
the
eloquent
descriptions
and
the
striking
reflections
,
and
all
that
part
of
it
?
"
said
William
,
perplexedly
shaking
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nobody
!
"
<EOS>
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
eloquent
descriptions
and
the
striking
reflections
are
just
the
parts
of
a
story
-
book
that
people
never
read
.
<EOS>
Whatever
we
do
,
let
us
not
,
if
we
can
possibly
help
it
,
write
so
much
as
a
single
sentence
that
can
be
conveniently
skipped
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
come
!
<EOS>
"
I
continued
,
seeing
him
begin
to
shake
his
head
again
;
"
no
more
objections
,
William
<EOS>
,
I
am
too
certain
of
the
success
of
my
plan
to
endure
them
.
<EOS>
If
you
still
doubt
,
let
us
refer
the
new
project
to
a
competent
arbitrator
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
is
coming
to
see
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
him
all
that
I
have
told
you
;
and
if
you
will
promise
on
your
side
,
I
will
engage
on
mine
to
be
guided
entirely
by
his
opinion
.
"
  
<EOS>
William
smiled
,
and
readily
gave
the
promise
.
<EOS>
This
was
all
I
wanted
to
send
me
to
bed
in
the
best
spirits
.
<EOS>
For
,
of
course
,
I
should
never
have
thought
of
mentioning
the
doctor
as
an
arbitrator
,
if
I
had
not
known
beforehand
that
he
was
sure
to
be
on
my
side
.
  
<EOS>
6th
.
 
<EOS>
The
arbitrator
has
shown
that
he
deserved
my
confidence
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
ranked
himself
entirely
on
my
side
before
I
had
half
done
explaining
to
him
what
my
new
project
really
was
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
husband
's
doubts
and
difficulties
,
the
dear
good
man
would
not
so
much
as
hear
them
mentioned
.
"
<EOS>
No
objections
,
"
he
cried
,
gayly
;
"
set
to
work
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
and
make
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
I
always
said
your
wife
was
worth
her
weight
in
gold
 
<EOS>
and
here
she
is
now
,
all
ready
to
get
into
the
bookseller
's
scales
and
prove
it
.
<EOS>
Set
to
work
!
<EOS>
set
to
work
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
With
all
my
heart
,
"
said
William
,
beginning
at
last
to
catch
the
infection
of
our
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
"
But
when
my
part
of
the
work
and
my
wife
's
has
been
completed
,
what
are
we
to
do
with
the
produce
of
our
labor
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Leave
that
to
me
,
"
answered
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
Finish
your
book
and
send
it
to
my
house
;
I
will
show
it
at
once
to
the
editor
of
our
country
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
has
plenty
of
literary
friends
in
London
,
and
he
will
be
just
the
man
to
help
you
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
"
added
the
doctor
,
addressing
me
,
"
you
think
of
everything
,
Mrs.
Kerby
;
pray
have
you
thought
of
a
name
yet
for
the
new
book
?
"
  
<EOS>
At
that
question
it
was
my
turn
to
be
"
taken
aback
.
<EOS>
"
The
idea
of
naming
the
book
had
never
once
entered
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
title
is
of
vast
importance
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
knitting
his
brows
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
all
think
about
that
.
<EOS>
What
shall
it
be
?
<EOS>
eh
,
Mrs.
Kerby
,
what
shall
it
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
something
may
strike
us
after
we
have
fairly
set
to
work
,
"
my
husband
suggested
.
<EOS>
"
Talking
of
work
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
me
,
"
how
are
you
to
find
time
,
<EOS>
Leah
,
with
your
nursery
occupations
,
for
writing
down
all
the
stories
as
I
tell
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
thinking
of
that
this
morning
,
"
said
I
,
"
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
I
shall
have
but
little
leisure
to
write
from
your
dictation
in
the
day
-
time
.
<EOS>
What
with
dressing
and
washing
the
children
,
teaching
them
,
giving
them
their
meals
,
taking
them
out
to
walk
,
and
keeping
them
amused
at
home
 
to
say
nothing
of
sitting
sociably
at
work
with
the
dame
and
her
two
girls
in
the
afternoon
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
I
shall
have
few
opportunities
of
doing
my
part
of
the
book
between
breakfast
and
tea
-
time
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
children
are
in
bed
,
and
the
farmer
and
his
family
are
reading
or
dozing
,
I
should
have
at
least
three
unoccupied
hours
to
spare
.
<EOS>
So
,
if
you
do
n't
mind
putting
off
our
working
-
time
till
after
dark
"
  
"
There
's
the
title
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
the
doctor
,
jumping
out
of
his
chair
as
if
he
had
been
shot
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
?
"
cried
I
,
looking
all
round
me
in
the
surprise
of
the
moment
,
as
if
I
had
expected
to
see
the
title
magically
inscribed
for
us
on
the
walls
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
your
last
words
,
to
be
sure
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
You
said
just
now
that
you
would
not
have
leisure
to
write
from
Mr.
Kerby
's
dictation
till
after
dark
.
<EOS>
What
can
we
do
better
than
name
the
book
after
the
time
when
the
book
is
written
?
<EOS>
Call
it
boldly
,
After
dark
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
before
anybody
says
a
word
for
or
against
it
,
let
us
see
how
the
name
looks
on
paper
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
opened
my
writing
-
desk
in
a
great
flutter
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
selected
the
largest
sheet
of
paper
and
the
broadest
-
nibbed
pen
he
could
find
,
and
wrote
in
majestic
round
-
text
letters
,
with
alternate
thin
and
thick
strokes
beautiful
to
see
,
the
two
cabalistic
words
                       
AFTER
DARK
.
  
<EOS>
We
all
three
laid
our
heads
together
over
the
paper
,
and
in
breathless
silence
studied
the
effect
of
the
round
-
text
:
<EOS>
William
raising
his
green
shade
in
the
excitement
of
the
moment
,
and
actually
disobeying
the
doctor
's
orders
about
not
using
his
eyes
,
in
the
doctor
's
own
presence
!
<EOS>
After
a
good
long
stare
,
we
looked
round
solemnly
in
each
other
's
faces
and
nodded
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
doubt
whatever
on
the
subject
after
seeing
the
round
-
text
.
<EOS>
In
one
happy
moment
the
doctor
had
hit
on
the
right
name
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
written
the
title
-
page
,
"
said
our
good
friend
,
taking
up
his
hat
to
go
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
I
leave
it
to
you
two
to
write
the
book
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Since
then
I
have
mended
four
pens
and
bought
a
quire
of
letter
-
paper
at
the
village
shop
.
<EOS>
William
is
to
ponder
well
over
his
stories
in
the
daytime
,
so
as
to
be
quite
ready
for
me
"
after
dark
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
to
commence
our
new
occupation
this
evening
.
<EOS>
My
heart
beats
fast
and
my
eyes
moisten
when
I
think
of
it
.
<EOS>
How
many
of
our
dearest
interests
depend
upon
the
one
little
beginning
that
we
are
to
make
to
-
night
!
  
<EOS>
PROLOGUE
TO
THE
FIRST
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
Before
I
begin
,
by
the
aid
of
my
wife
's
patient
attention
and
ready
pen
,
to
relate
any
of
the
stories
which
I
have
heard
at
various
times
from
persons
whose
likenesses
I
have
been
employed
to
take
,
it
will
not
be
amiss
if
I
try
to
secure
the
reader
's
interest
in
the
following
pages
,
by
briefly
explaining
how
I
became
possessed
of
the
narrative
matter
which
they
contain
.
  
<EOS>
Of
myself
I
have
nothing
to
say
,
but
that
I
have
followed
the
profession
of
a
traveling
portrait
-
painter
for
the
last
fifteen
years
.
<EOS>
The
pursuit
of
my
calling
has
not
only
led
me
all
through
England
,
but
has
taken
me
twice
to
Scotland
,
and
once
to
Ireland
.
<EOS>
In
moving
from
district
to
district
,
I
am
never
guided
beforehand
by
any
settled
plan
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
letters
of
recommendation
which
I
get
from
persons
who
are
satisfied
with
the
work
I
have
done
for
them
determine
the
direction
in
which
I
travel
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
I
hear
of
a
new
neighborhood
in
which
there
is
no
resident
artist
of
ability
,
and
remove
thither
on
speculation
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
my
friends
among
the
picture
-
dealers
say
a
good
word
on
my
behalf
to
their
rich
customers
,
and
so
pave
the
way
for
me
in
the
large
towns
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
my
prosperous
and
famous
brother
-
artists
,
hearing
of
small
commissions
which
it
is
not
worth
their
while
to
accept
,
mention
my
name
,
and
procure
me
introductions
to
pleasant
country
houses
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
get
on
,
now
in
one
way
and
now
in
another
,
not
winning
a
reputation
or
making
a
fortune
,
but
happier
,
perhaps
,
on
the
whole
,
than
many
men
who
have
got
both
the
one
and
the
other
.
<EOS>
So
,
at
least
,
I
try
to
think
now
,
though
I
started
in
my
youth
with
as
high
an
ambition
as
the
best
of
them
.
<EOS>
Thank
God
,
it
is
not
my
business
here
to
speak
of
past
times
and
their
disappointments
.
<EOS>
A
twinge
of
the
old
hopeless
heartache
comes
over
me
sometimes
still
,
when
I
think
of
my
student
days
.
  
<EOS>
One
peculiarity
of
my
present
way
of
life
is
,
that
it
brings
me
into
contact
with
all
sorts
of
characters
.
<EOS>
I
almost
feel
,
by
this
time
,
as
if
I
had
painted
every
civilized
variety
of
the
human
race
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
,
my
experience
of
the
world
,
rough
as
it
has
been
,
has
not
taught
me
to
think
unkindly
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
I
have
certainly
received
such
treatment
at
the
hands
of
some
of
my
sitters
as
I
could
not
describe
without
saddening
and
shocking
any
kind
-
hearted
reader
;
but
,
taking
one
year
and
one
place
with
another
,
I
have
cause
to
remember
with
gratitude
and
respect
 
sometimes
even
with
friendship
and
affection
 
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
numerous
persons
who
have
employed
me
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
results
of
my
experience
are
curious
in
a
moral
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
For
example
,
I
have
found
women
almost
uniformly
less
delicate
in
asking
me
about
my
terms
,
and
less
generous
in
remunerating
me
for
my
services
,
than
men
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
men
,
within
my
knowledge
,
are
decidedly
vainer
of
their
personal
attractions
,
and
more
vexatiously
anxious
to
have
them
done
full
justice
to
on
canvas
,
than
women
.
<EOS>
Taking
both
sexes
together
,
I
have
found
young
people
,
for
the
most
part
,
more
gentle
,
more
reasonable
,
and
more
considerate
than
old
.
<EOS>
And
,
summing
up
,
in
a
general
way
,
my
experience
of
different
ranks
(
which
extends
,
let
me
premise
,
all
the
way
down
from
peers
to
publicans
)
,
I
have
met
with
most
of
my
formal
and
ungracious
receptions
among
rich
people
of
uncertain
social
standing
:
the
highest
classes
and
the
lowest
among
my
employers
almost
always
contrive
 
in
widely
different
ways
,
of
course
,
to
make
me
feel
at
home
as
soon
as
I
enter
their
houses
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
great
obstacle
that
I
have
to
contend
against
in
the
practice
of
my
profession
is
not
,
as
some
persons
may
imagine
,
the
difficulty
of
making
my
sitters
keep
their
heads
still
while
I
paint
them
,
but
the
difficulty
of
getting
them
to
preserve
the
natural
look
and
the
every
-
day
peculiarities
of
dress
and
manner
.
<EOS>
People
will
assume
an
expression
,
will
brush
up
their
hair
,
will
correct
any
little
characteristic
carelessness
in
their
apparel
 
will
,
in
short
,
when
they
want
to
have
their
likenesses
taken
,
look
as
if
they
were
sitting
for
their
pictures
.
<EOS>
If
I
paint
them
,
under
these
artificial
circumstances
,
I
fail
of
course
to
present
them
in
their
habitual
aspect
;
and
my
portrait
,
as
a
necessary
consequence
,
disappoints
everybody
,
the
sitter
always
included
.
<EOS>
When
we
wish
to
judge
of
a
man
's
character
by
his
handwriting
,
we
want
his
customary
scrawl
dashed
off
with
his
common
workaday
pen
,
not
his
best
small
-
text
,
traced
laboriously
with
the
finest
procurable
crow
-
quill
point
.
<EOS>
So
it
is
with
portrait
-
painting
,
which
is
,
after
all
,
nothing
but
a
right
reading
of
the
externals
of
character
recognizably
presented
to
the
view
of
others
.
  
<EOS>
Experience
,
after
repeated
trials
,
has
proved
to
me
that
the
only
way
of
getting
sitters
who
persist
in
assuming
a
set
look
to
resume
their
habitual
expression
,
is
to
lead
them
into
talking
about
some
subject
in
which
they
are
greatly
interested
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
only
beguile
them
into
speaking
earnestly
,
no
matter
on
what
topic
,
I
am
sure
of
recovering
their
natural
expression
;
sure
of
seeing
all
the
little
precious
everyday
peculiarities
of
the
man
or
woman
peep
out
,
one
after
another
,
quite
unawares
.
<EOS>
The
long
,
maundering
stories
about
nothing
,
the
wearisome
recitals
of
petty
grievances
,
the
local
anecdotes
unrelieved
by
the
faintest
suspicion
of
anything
like
general
interest
,
which
I
have
been
condemned
to
hear
,
as
a
consequence
of
thawing
the
ice
off
the
features
of
formal
sitters
by
the
method
just
described
,
would
fill
hundreds
of
volumes
,
and
promote
the
repose
of
thousands
of
readers
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
if
I
have
suffered
under
the
tediousness
of
the
many
,
I
have
not
been
without
my
compensating
gains
from
the
wisdom
and
experience
of
the
few
.
<EOS>
To
some
of
my
sitters
I
have
been
indebted
for
information
which
has
enlarged
my
mind
 
to
some
for
advice
which
has
lightened
my
heart
 
to
some
for
narratives
of
strange
adventure
which
riveted
my
attention
at
the
time
,
which
have
served
to
interest
and
amuse
my
fireside
circle
for
many
years
past
,
and
which
are
now
,
<EOS>
I
would
fain
hope
,
destined
to
make
kind
friends
for
me
among
a
wider
audience
than
any
that
I
have
yet
addressed
.
  
<EOS>
Singularly
enough
,
almost
all
the
best
stories
that
I
have
heard
from
my
sitters
have
been
told
by
accident
.
<EOS>
I
only
remember
two
cases
in
which
a
story
was
volunteered
to
me
,
and
,
although
I
have
often
tried
the
experiment
,
I
can
not
call
to
mind
even
a
single
instance
in
which
leading
questions
(
as
the
lawyers
call
them
)
on
my
part
,
addressed
to
a
sitter
,
ever
produced
any
result
worth
recording
.
<EOS>
Over
and
over
again
,
I
have
been
disastrously
successful
in
encouraging
dull
people
to
weary
me
.
<EOS>
But
the
clever
people
who
have
something
interesting
to
say
,
seem
,
so
far
as
I
have
observed
them
,
to
acknowledge
no
other
stimulant
than
chance
.
<EOS>
For
every
story
which
I
propose
including
in
the
present
collection
,
excepting
one
,
I
have
been
indebted
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
capricious
influence
of
the
same
chance
.
<EOS>
Something
my
sitter
has
seen
about
me
,
something
I
have
remarked
in
my
sitter
,
or
in
the
room
in
which
I
take
the
likeness
,
or
in
the
neighborhood
through
which
I
pass
on
my
way
to
work
,
has
suggested
the
necessary
association
,
or
has
started
the
right
train
of
recollections
,
and
then
the
story
appeared
to
begin
of
its
own
accord
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
the
most
casual
notice
,
on
my
part
,
of
some
very
unpromising
object
has
smoothed
the
way
for
the
relation
of
a
long
and
interesting
narrative
.
<EOS>
I
first
heard
one
of
the
most
dramatic
of
the
stories
that
will
be
presented
in
this
book
,
merely
through
being
carelessly
inquisitive
to
know
the
history
of
a
stuffed
poodle
-
dog
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
thus
not
without
reason
that
I
lay
some
stress
on
the
desirableness
of
prefacing
each
one
of
the
following
narratives
by
a
brief
account
of
the
curious
manner
in
which
I
became
possessed
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
capacity
for
repeating
these
stories
correctly
,
I
can
answer
for
it
that
my
memory
may
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
I
may
claim
it
as
a
merit
,
because
it
is
after
all
a
mechanical
one
,
that
I
forget
nothing
,
and
that
I
can
call
long
-
passed
conversations
and
events
as
readily
to
my
recollection
as
if
they
had
happened
but
a
few
weeks
ago
.
<EOS>
Of
two
things
at
least
I
feel
tolerably
certain
beforehand
,
in
meditating
over
the
contents
of
this
book
:
<EOS>
First
,
that
I
can
repeat
correctly
all
that
I
have
heard
;
and
,
secondly
,
that
I
have
never
missed
anything
worth
hearing
when
my
sitters
were
addressing
me
on
an
interesting
subject
.
<EOS>
Although
I
can
not
take
the
lead
in
talking
while
I
am
engaged
in
painting
,
I
can
listen
while
others
speak
,
and
work
all
the
better
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
in
the
way
of
general
preface
to
the
pages
for
which
I
am
about
to
ask
the
reader
's
attention
.
<EOS>
Let
me
now
advance
to
particulars
,
and
describe
how
I
came
to
hear
the
first
story
in
the
present
collection
.
<EOS>
I
begin
with
it
because
it
is
the
story
that
I
have
oftenest
"
rehearsed
,
"
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
the
stage
.
<EOS>
Wherever
I
go
,
I
am
sooner
or
later
sure
to
tell
it
.
<EOS>
Only
last
night
,
I
was
persuaded
into
repeating
it
once
more
by
the
inhabitants
of
the
farmhouse
in
which
I
am
now
staying
.
  
<EOS>
Not
many
years
ago
,
on
returning
from
a
short
holiday
visit
to
a
friend
settled
in
Paris
,
I
found
professional
letters
awaiting
me
at
my
agent
's
in
London
,
which
required
my
immediate
presence
in
Liverpool
.
<EOS>
Without
stopping
to
unpack
,
I
proceeded
by
the
first
conveyance
to
my
new
destination
;
and
,
calling
at
the
picture
-
dealer
's
shop
,
where
portrait
-
painting
engagements
were
received
for
me
,
found
to
my
great
satisfaction
that
I
had
remunerative
employment
in
prospect
,
in
and
about
Liverpool
,
for
at
least
two
months
to
come
.
<EOS>
I
was
putting
up
my
letters
in
high
spirits
,
and
was
just
leaving
the
picture
-
dealer
's
shop
to
look
out
for
comfortable
lodgings
,
when
I
was
met
at
the
door
by
the
landlord
of
one
of
the
largest
hotels
in
Liverpool
 
an
old
acquaintance
whom
I
had
known
as
manager
of
a
tavern
in
London
in
my
student
days
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Kerby
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
in
great
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
an
unexpected
meeting
!
<EOS>
the
last
man
in
the
world
whom
I
expected
to
see
,
and
yet
the
very
man
whose
services
I
want
to
make
use
of
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
more
work
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
said
I
;
"
are
all
the
people
in
Liverpool
going
to
have
their
portraits
painted
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
know
of
one
,
"
replied
the
landlord
,
"
a
gentleman
staying
at
my
hotel
,
who
wants
a
chalk
drawing
done
for
him
.
<EOS>
I
was
on
my
way
here
to
inquire
of
any
artist
whom
our
picture
-
dealing
friend
could
recommend
.
<EOS>
How
glad
I
am
that
I
met
you
before
I
had
committed
myself
to
employing
a
stranger
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
likeness
wanted
at
once
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
,
thinking
of
the
number
of
engagements
that
I
had
already
got
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
"
Immediately
 
to
-
day
 
this
very
hour
,
if
possible
,
"
said
the
landlord
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Faulkner
,
the
gentleman
I
am
speaking
of
,
was
to
have
sailed
yesterday
for
the
Brazils
from
this
place
;
but
the
wind
shifted
last
night
to
the
wrong
quarter
,
and
he
came
ashore
again
this
morning
.
<EOS>
He
may
of
course
be
detained
here
for
some
time
;
but
he
may
also
be
called
on
board
ship
at
half
an
hour
's
notice
,
if
the
wind
shifts
back
again
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
This
uncertainty
makes
it
a
matter
of
importance
that
the
likeness
should
be
begun
immediately
.
<EOS>
Undertake
it
if
you
possibly
can
,
for
Mr.
Faulkner
's
a
liberal
gentleman
,
who
is
sure
to
give
you
your
own
terms
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
reflected
for
a
minute
or
two
.
<EOS>
The
portrait
was
only
wanted
in
chalk
,
and
would
not
take
long
;
besides
,
I
might
finish
it
in
the
evening
,
if
my
other
engagements
pressed
hard
upon
me
in
the
daytime
.
<EOS>
Why
not
leave
my
luggage
at
the
picture
-
dealer
's
,
put
off
looking
for
lodgings
till
night
,
and
secure
the
new
commission
boldly
by
going
back
at
once
with
the
landlord
to
the
hotel
?
<EOS>
I
decided
on
following
this
course
almost
as
soon
as
the
idea
occurred
to
me
 
put
my
chalks
in
my
pocket
,
and
a
sheet
of
drawing
paper
in
the
first
of
my
portfolios
that
came
to
hand
 
<EOS>
and
so
presented
myself
before
Mr.
Faulkner
,
ready
to
take
his
likeness
,
literally
at
five
minutes
'
notice
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
him
a
very
pleasant
,
intelligent
man
,
young
and
handsome
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
great
traveler
;
had
visited
all
the
wonders
of
the
East
;
and
was
now
about
to
explore
the
wilds
of
the
vast
South
American
Continent
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
he
told
me
good
-
humoredly
and
unconstrainedly
while
I
was
preparing
my
drawing
materials
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
I
had
put
him
in
the
right
light
and
position
,
and
had
seated
myself
opposite
to
him
,
he
changed
the
subject
of
conversation
,
and
asked
me
,
a
little
confusedly
as
I
thought
,
if
it
was
not
a
customary
practice
among
portrait
-
painters
to
gloss
over
the
faults
in
their
sitters
'
faces
,
and
to
make
as
much
as
possible
of
any
good
points
which
their
features
might
possess
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
described
the
whole
art
and
mystery
of
successful
portrait
-
painting
in
a
few
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
May
I
beg
,
then
,
"
said
he
,
"
that
you
will
depart
from
the
usual
practice
in
my
case
,
and
draw
me
with
all
my
defects
,
exactly
as
I
am
?
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
"
he
went
on
,
after
a
moment
's
pause
,
"
the
likeness
you
are
now
preparing
to
take
is
intended
for
my
mother
.
<EOS>
My
roving
disposition
makes
me
a
great
anxiety
to
her
,
and
she
parted
from
me
this
last
time
very
sadly
and
unwillingly
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
the
idea
came
into
my
head
,
but
it
struck
me
this
morning
that
I
could
not
better
employ
the
time
,
while
I
was
delayed
here
on
shore
,
than
by
getting
my
likeness
done
to
send
to
her
as
a
keepsake
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
portrait
of
me
since
I
was
a
child
,
and
she
is
sure
to
value
a
drawing
of
me
more
than
anything
else
I
could
send
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
only
trouble
you
with
this
explanation
to
prove
that
I
am
really
sincere
in
my
wish
to
be
drawn
unflatteringly
,
exactly
as
I
am
.
"
  
<EOS>
Secretly
respecting
and
admiring
him
for
what
he
had
just
said
,
I
promised
that
his
directions
should
be
implicitly
followed
,
and
began
to
work
immediately
.
<EOS>
Before
I
had
pursued
my
occupation
for
ten
minutes
,
the
conversation
began
to
flag
,
and
the
usual
obstacle
to
my
success
with
a
sitter
gradually
set
itself
up
between
us
.
<EOS>
Quite
unconsciously
,
of
course
,
Mr.
Faulkner
stiffened
his
neck
,
shut
his
month
,
and
contracted
his
eyebrows
 
evidently
under
the
impression
that
he
was
facilitating
the
process
of
taking
his
portrait
by
making
his
face
as
like
a
lifeless
mask
as
possible
.
<EOS>
All
traces
of
his
natural
animated
expression
were
fast
disappearing
,
and
he
was
beginning
to
change
into
a
heavy
and
rather
melancholy
-
looking
man
.
  
<EOS>
This
complete
alteration
was
of
no
great
consequence
so
long
as
I
was
only
engaged
in
drawing
the
outline
of
his
face
and
the
general
form
of
his
features
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
worked
on
doggedly
for
more
than
an
hour
 
then
left
off
to
point
my
chalks
again
,
and
to
give
my
sitter
a
few
minutes
'
rest
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
the
likeness
had
not
suffered
through
Mr.
Faulkner
's
unfortunate
notion
of
the
right
way
of
sitting
for
his
portrait
;
but
the
time
of
difficulty
,
as
I
well
knew
,
was
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
think
of
putting
any
expression
into
the
drawing
unless
I
could
contrive
some
means
,
when
he
resumed
his
chair
,
of
making
him
look
like
himself
again
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
talk
to
him
about
foreign
parts
,
"
thought
I
,
"
and
try
if
I
ca
n't
make
him
forget
that
he
is
sitting
for
his
picture
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
While
I
was
pointing
my
chalks
Mr.
Faulkner
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
chanced
to
see
the
portfolio
I
had
brought
with
me
leaning
against
the
wall
,
and
asked
if
there
were
any
sketches
in
it
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
there
were
a
few
which
I
had
made
during
my
recent
stay
in
Paris
;
"
In
Paris
?
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
with
a
look
of
interest
;
"
may
I
see
them
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
gave
him
the
permission
he
asked
as
a
matter
of
course
.
<EOS>
Sitting
down
,
he
took
the
portfolio
on
his
knee
,
and
began
to
look
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
turned
over
the
first
five
sketches
rapidly
enough
;
but
when
he
came
to
the
sixth
,
I
saw
his
face
flush
directly
,
and
observed
that
he
took
the
drawing
out
of
the
portfolio
,
carried
it
to
the
window
,
and
remained
silently
absorbed
in
the
contemplation
of
it
for
full
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
turned
round
to
me
,
and
asked
very
anxiously
if
I
had
any
objection
to
part
with
that
sketch
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
least
interesting
drawing
of
the
collection
 
merely
a
view
in
one
of
the
streets
running
by
the
backs
of
the
houses
in
the
Palais
Royal
.
<EOS>
Some
four
or
five
of
these
houses
were
comprised
in
the
view
,
which
was
of
no
particular
use
to
me
in
any
way
;
and
which
was
too
valueless
,
as
a
work
of
art
,
for
me
to
think
of
selling
it
.
<EOS>
I
begged
his
acceptance
of
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
He
thanked
me
quite
warmly
;
and
then
,
seeing
that
I
looked
a
little
surprised
at
the
odd
selection
he
had
made
from
my
sketches
<EOS>
,
laughingly
asked
me
if
I
could
guess
why
he
had
been
so
anxious
to
become
possessed
of
the
view
which
I
had
given
him
?
  
<EOS>
"
Probably
,
"
I
answered
,
"
there
is
some
remarkable
historical
association
connected
with
that
street
at
the
back
of
the
Palais
Royal
,
of
which
I
am
ignorant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
said
Mr.
Faulkner
;
"
at
least
none
that
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
The
only
association
connected
with
the
place
in
my
mind
is
a
purely
personal
association
.
<EOS>
Look
at
this
house
in
your
drawing
 
the
house
with
the
water
-
pipe
running
down
it
from
top
to
bottom
.
<EOS>
I
once
passed
a
night
there
 
a
night
<EOS>
I
shall
never
forget
to
the
day
of
my
death
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
some
awkward
traveling
adventures
in
my
time
;
but
that
adventure
!
<EOS>
Well
,
never
mind
,
suppose
we
begin
the
sitting
.
<EOS>
I
make
but
a
bad
return
for
your
kindness
in
giving
me
the
sketch
by
thus
wasting
your
time
in
mere
talk
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
come
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
as
he
went
back
to
the
sitter
's
chair
,
"
I
shall
see
your
natural
expression
on
your
face
if
I
can
only
get
you
to
talk
about
that
adventure
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
easy
enough
to
lead
him
in
the
right
direction
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
hint
from
me
,
he
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
house
in
the
back
street
.
<EOS>
Without
,
I
hope
,
showing
any
undue
curiosity
,
I
contrived
to
let
him
see
that
I
felt
a
deep
interest
in
everything
he
now
said
.
<EOS>
After
two
or
three
preliminary
hesitations
,
he
at
last
,
to
my
great
joy
,
fairly
started
on
the
narrative
of
his
adventure
.
<EOS>
In
the
interest
of
his
subject
he
soon
completely
forgot
that
he
was
sitting
for
his
portrait
 
the
very
expression
that
I
wanted
came
over
his
face
 
and
my
drawing
proceeded
toward
completion
,
in
the
right
direction
,
and
to
the
best
purpose
.
<EOS>
At
every
fresh
touch
I
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
I
was
now
getting
the
better
of
my
grand
difficulty
;
and
I
enjoyed
the
additional
gratification
of
having
my
work
lightened
by
the
recital
of
a
true
story
,
which
possessed
,
in
my
estimation
,
all
the
excitement
of
the
most
exciting
romance
.
  
<EOS>
This
,
as
I
recollect
it
,
is
how
Mr.
Faulkner
told
me
his
adventure
:
  
<EOS>
THE
TRAVELER
'S
STORY
  
OF
  
A
TERRIBLY
STRANGE
BED
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
after
my
education
at
college
was
finished
,
I
happened
to
be
staying
at
Paris
with
an
English
friend
.
<EOS>
We
were
both
young
men
then
,
and
lived
,
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
,
rather
a
wild
life
,
in
the
delightful
city
of
our
sojourn
.
<EOS>
One
night
we
were
idling
about
the
neighborhood
of
the
Palais
Royal
,
doubtful
to
what
amusement
<EOS>
we
should
next
betake
ourselves
.
<EOS>
My
friend
proposed
a
visit
to
Frascati
's
;
but
his
suggestion
was
not
to
my
taste
.
<EOS>
I
knew
Frascati
's
,
as
the
French
saying
is
,
by
heart
;
had
lost
and
won
plenty
of
five
-
franc
pieces
there
,
merely
for
amusement
's
sake
,
until
it
was
amusement
no
longer
,
and
was
thoroughly
tired
,
in
fact
,
of
all
the
ghastly
respectabilities
of
such
a
social
anomaly
as
a
respectable
gambling
-
house
.
"
<EOS>
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
"
said
I
to
my
friend
,
"
let
us
go
somewhere
where
we
can
see
a
little
genuine
,
blackguard
,
poverty
-
stricken
gaming
with
no
false
gingerbread
glitter
thrown
over
it
all
.
<EOS>
Let
us
get
away
from
fashionable
Frascati
's
,
to
a
house
where
they
do
n't
mind
letting
in
a
man
with
a
ragged
coat
,
or
a
man
with
no
coat
,
ragged
or
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Very
well
,
"
said
my
friend
,
"
we
need
n't
go
out
of
the
Palais
Royal
to
find
the
sort
of
company
you
want
.
<EOS>
Here
's
the
place
just
before
us
;
as
blackguard
a
place
,
by
all
report
,
as
you
could
possibly
wish
to
see
.
<EOS>
"
In
another
minute
we
arrived
at
the
door
,
and
entered
the
house
,
the
back
of
which
you
have
drawn
in
your
sketch
.
  
<EOS>
When
we
got
upstairs
,
and
had
left
our
hats
and
sticks
with
the
doorkeeper
,
we
were
admitted
into
the
chief
gambling
-
room
.
<EOS>
We
did
not
find
many
people
assembled
there
.
<EOS>
But
,
few
as
the
men
were
who
looked
up
at
us
on
our
entrance
,
they
were
all
types
 
<EOS>
lamentably
true
types
 
of
their
respective
classes
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
come
to
see
blackguards
;
but
these
men
were
something
worse
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
comic
side
,
more
or
less
appreciable
,
in
all
blackguardism
 
<EOS>
here
there
was
nothing
but
tragedy
 
mute
,
weird
tragedy
.
<EOS>
The
quiet
in
the
room
was
horrible
.
<EOS>
The
thin
,
haggard
,
long
-
haired
young
man
,
whose
sunken
eyes
fiercely
watched
the
turning
up
of
the
cards
,
never
spoke
;
the
flabby
,
fat
-
faced
,
pimply
player
,
who
pricked
his
piece
of
pasteboard
perseveringly
,
to
register
how
often
black
won
,
and
how
often
red
 
never
spoke
;
the
dirty
,
wrinkled
old
man
,
with
the
vulture
eyes
and
the
darned
great
-
coat
,
who
had
lost
his
last
sou
,
and
still
looked
on
desperately
,
after
he
could
play
no
longer
 
never
spoke
.
<EOS>
Even
the
voice
of
the
croupier
sounded
as
if
it
were
strangely
dulled
and
thickened
in
the
atmosphere
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
I
had
entered
the
place
to
laugh
,
but
the
spectacle
before
me
was
something
to
weep
over
.
<EOS>
I
soon
found
it
necessary
to
take
refuge
in
excitement
from
the
depression
of
spirits
which
was
fast
stealing
on
me
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
I
sought
the
nearest
excitement
,
by
going
to
the
table
and
beginning
to
play
.
<EOS>
Still
more
unfortunately
,
as
the
event
will
show
,
I
won
 
won
prodigiously
;
won
incredibly
;
won
at
such
a
rate
that
the
regular
players
at
the
table
crowded
round
me
;
and
staring
at
my
stakes
with
hungry
,
superstitious
eyes
,
whispered
to
one
another
that
the
English
stranger
was
going
to
break
the
bank
.
  
<EOS>
The
game
was
Rouge
et
Noir
.
<EOS>
I
had
played
at
it
in
every
city
in
Europe
,
without
,
however
,
the
care
or
the
wish
to
study
the
Theory
of
Chances
 
that
philosopher
's
stone
of
all
gamblers
!
<EOS>
And
a
gambler
,
in
the
strict
sense
of
the
word
,
I
had
never
been
.
<EOS>
I
was
heart
-
whole
from
the
corroding
passion
for
play
.
<EOS>
My
gaming
was
a
mere
idle
amusement
.
<EOS>
I
never
resorted
to
it
by
necessity
,
because
I
never
knew
what
it
was
to
want
money
.
<EOS>
I
never
practiced
it
so
incessantly
as
to
lose
more
than
I
could
afford
,
or
to
gain
more
than
I
could
coolly
pocket
without
being
thrown
off
my
balance
by
my
good
luck
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
had
hitherto
frequented
gambling
-
tables
 
just
as
I
frequented
ball
-
rooms
and
opera
-
houses
 
because
they
amused
me
,
and
because
I
had
nothing
better
to
do
with
my
leisure
hours
.
  
<EOS>
But
on
this
occasion
it
was
very
different
 
now
,
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
,
I
felt
what
the
passion
for
play
really
was
.
<EOS>
My
success
first
bewildered
,
and
then
,
in
the
most
literal
meaning
of
the
word
,
intoxicated
me
.
<EOS>
Incredible
as
it
may
appear
,
it
is
nevertheless
true
,
that
I
only
lost
when
I
attempted
to
estimate
chances
,
and
played
according
to
previous
calculation
.
<EOS>
If
I
left
everything
to
luck
,
and
staked
without
any
care
or
consideration
,
I
was
sure
to
win
 
to
win
in
the
face
of
every
recognized
probability
in
favor
of
the
bank
.
<EOS>
At
first
some
of
the
men
present
ventured
their
money
safely
enough
on
my
color
;
but
I
speedily
increased
my
stakes
to
sums
which
they
dared
not
risk
.
<EOS>
One
after
another
they
left
off
playing
,
and
breathlessly
looked
on
at
my
game
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
time
after
time
,
I
staked
higher
and
higher
,
and
still
won
.
<EOS>
The
excitement
in
the
room
rose
to
fever
pitch
.
<EOS>
The
silence
was
interrupted
by
a
deep
-
muttered
chorus
of
oaths
and
exclamations
in
different
languages
,
every
time
the
gold
was
shoveled
across
to
my
side
of
the
table
 
even
the
imperturbable
croupier
dashed
his
rake
on
the
floor
in
a
(
French
)
fury
of
astonishment
at
my
success
.
<EOS>
But
one
man
present
preserved
his
self
-
possession
,
and
that
man
was
my
friend
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
my
side
,
and
whispering
in
English
,
begged
me
to
leave
the
place
,
satisfied
with
what
I
had
already
gained
.
<EOS>
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
say
that
he
repeated
his
warnings
and
entreaties
several
times
,
and
only
left
me
and
went
away
after
I
had
rejected
his
advice
<EOS>
(
I
was
to
all
intents
and
purposes
gambling
drunk
)
in
terms
which
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
address
me
again
that
night
.
  
<EOS>
Shortly
after
he
had
gone
,
a
hoarse
voice
behind
me
cried
:
"
Permit
me
,
my
dear
sir
 
<EOS>
permit
me
to
restore
to
their
proper
place
two
napoleons
which
you
have
dropped
.
<EOS>
Wonderful
luck
,
sir
!
<EOS>
I
pledge
you
my
word
of
honor
,
as
an
old
soldier
,
in
the
course
of
my
long
experience
in
this
sort
of
thing
,
I
never
saw
such
luck
as
yours
 
never
!
<EOS>
Go
on
,
sir
 
Sacre
mille
bombes
!
<EOS>
Go
on
boldly
,
and
break
the
bank
!
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
round
and
saw
,
nodding
and
smiling
at
me
with
inveterate
civility
,
a
tall
man
,
dressed
in
a
frogged
and
braided
surtout
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
in
my
senses
,
I
should
have
considered
him
,
personally
,
as
being
rather
a
suspicious
specimen
of
an
old
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
had
goggling
,
bloodshot
eyes
,
mangy
mustaches
,
and
a
broken
nose
.
<EOS>
His
voice
betrayed
a
barrack
-
room
intonation
of
the
worst
order
,
and
he
had
the
dirtiest
pair
of
hands
I
ever
saw
 
even
in
France
.
<EOS>
These
little
personal
peculiarities
exercised
,
however
,
no
repelling
influence
on
me
.
<EOS>
In
the
mad
excitement
,
the
reckless
triumph
of
that
moment
,
I
was
ready
to
"
fraternize
"
with
anybody
who
encouraged
me
in
my
game
.
<EOS>
I
accepted
the
old
soldier
's
offered
pinch
of
snuff
;
clapped
him
on
the
back
,
and
swore
he
was
the
honestest
fellow
in
the
world
 
<EOS>
the
most
glorious
relic
of
the
Grand
Army
that
I
had
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
!
"
<EOS>
cried
my
military
friend
,
snapping
his
fingers
in
ecstasy
 
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
and
win
!
<EOS>
Break
the
bank
 
<EOS>
Mille
tonnerres
!
<EOS>
my
gallant
English
comrade
,
break
the
bank
!
"
  
<EOS>
And
I
did
go
on
 
<EOS>
went
on
at
such
a
rate
,
that
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
the
croupier
called
out
,
"
Gentlemen
,
the
bank
has
discontinued
for
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
All
the
notes
,
and
all
the
gold
in
that
"
bank
,
"
now
lay
in
a
heap
under
my
hands
;
the
whole
floating
capital
of
the
gambling
-
house
was
waiting
to
pour
into
my
pockets
!
  
<EOS>
"
Tie
up
the
money
in
your
pocket
-
handkerchief
,
my
worthy
sir
,
"
said
the
old
soldier
,
as
I
wildly
plunged
my
hands
into
my
heap
of
gold
.
<EOS>
"
Tie
it
up
,
as
we
used
to
tie
up
a
bit
of
dinner
in
the
Grand
Army
;
your
winnings
are
too
heavy
for
any
breeches
-
pockets
that
ever
were
sewed
.
<EOS>
There

<EOS>
that

it
 
<EOS>

them
in

notes
and
all

<EOS>
Credie

<EOS>
Stop

<EOS>
Ah

I
found
thee
at
last
?
<EOS>
Now
then

two
tight
double
knots
each
way
with
your
honorable
permission
,
and
the
money
's
safe

<EOS>
Feel

<EOS>
feel
it

<EOS>
hard
and
round
as
a

<EOS>
Ah

they
had
only
fired
such
cannon
-
balls
at
us
at
Austerlitz
 
nom

<EOS>
if
they
only
had
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
an
ancient
grenadier
,
as
an
ex
-
brave
of
the
French
army
,
what
remains
for
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
I
ask
what
?
<EOS>
Simply
this
:
to
entreat
my
valued
English
friend
to
drink
a
bottle
of
Champagne
with
me
,
and
toast
the
goddess
Fortune
in
foaming
goblets
before
we
part
!
"
  
<EOS>
Excellent

<EOS>
Ah

<EOS>
Never

I
,
the

soldier
,
order
another
bottle

and

a

of

with
it
!
<EOS>
"

No

"
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
the
second
bottle
of
Champagne
was
emptied
,
I
felt
as
if
I
had
been
drinking
liquid
fire
 
<EOS>
my
brain
seemed
all
aflame
.
<EOS>
No
excess
in
wine
had
ever
had
this
effect
on
me
before
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Was
it
the
result
of
a
stimulant
acting
upon
my
system
when
I
was
in
a
highly
excited
state
?
<EOS>
Was
my
stomach
in
a
particularly
disordered
condition
?
<EOS>
Or
was
the
Champagne
amazingly
strong
?
  
<EOS>
"
Ex
-
brave
of
the
French
Army
!
"
<EOS>
cried
I
,
in
a
mad
state
of
exhilaration
,
"
I
am
on
fire
!
<EOS>
how
are
you
?
<EOS>
You
have
set
me
on
fire
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
,
my
hero
of
Austerlitz
?
<EOS>
Let
us
have
a
third
bottle
of
Champagne
to
put
the
flame
out
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
soldier
wagged
his
head
,
rolled
his
goggle
-
eyes
,
until
I
expected
to
see
 
them
slip
out
of
their
sockets
;
placed
his
dirty
forefinger
by
the
side
of
his
broken
nose
;
solemnly
ejaculated
"
Coffee
!
"
and
immediately
ran
off
into
an
inner
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
word
pronounced
by
the
eccentric
veteran
seemed
to
have
a
magical
effect
on
the
rest
of
the
company
present
.
<EOS>
With
one
accord
they
all
rose
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Probably
they
had
expected
to
profit
by
my
intoxication
;
but
finding
that
my
new
friend
was
benevolently
bent
on
preventing
me
from
getting
dead
drunk
,
had
now
abandoned
all
hope
of
thriving
pleasantly
on
my
winnings
.
<EOS>
Whatever
their
motive
might
be
,
at
any
rate
they
went
away
in
a
body
.
<EOS>
When
the
old
soldier
returned
,
and
sat
down
again
opposite
to
me
at
the
table
,
we
had
the
room
to
ourselves
.
<EOS>
I
could
see
the
croupier
,
in
a
sort
of
vestibule
which
opened
out
of
it
,
eating
his
supper
in
solitude
.
<EOS>
The
silence
was
now
deeper
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
A
sudden
change
,
too
,
had
come
over
the
"
ex
-
brave
.
"
<EOS>
He
assumed
a
portentously
solemn
look
;
and
when
he
spoke
to
me
again
,
his
speech
was
ornamented
by
no
oaths
,
enforced
by
no
finger
-
snapping
,
enlivened
by
no
apostrophes
or
exclamations
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
he
,
in
mysteriously
confidential
tones
 
"
listen
to
an
old
soldier
's
advice
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
to
the
mistress
of
the
house
(
a
very
charming
woman
,
with
a
genius
for
cookery
!
)
<EOS>
to
impress
on
her
the
necessity
of
making
us
some
particularly
strong
and
good
coffee
.
<EOS>
You
must
drink
this
coffee
in
order
to
get
rid
of
your
little
amiable
exaltation
of
spirits
before
you
think
of
going
home
 
<EOS>
you
must
,
<EOS>
my
good
and
gracious
friend
!
<EOS>
With
all
that
money
to
take
home
to
-
night
,
it
is
a
sacred
duty
to
yourself
to
have
your
wits
about
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
known
to
be
a
winner
to
an
enormous
extent
by
several
gentlemen
present
to
-
night
,
who
,
in
a
certain
point
of
view
,
are
very
worthy
and
excellent
fellows
;
but
they
are
mortal
men
,
my
dear
sir
,
and
they
have
their
amiable
weaknesses
.
<EOS>
Need
I
say
more
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
no
,
no
!
<EOS>
you
understand
me
!
<EOS>
Now
,
this
is
what
you
must
do
 
send
for
a
cabriolet
when
you
feel
quite
well
again
 
<EOS>
draw
up
all
the
windows
when
you
get
into
it
 
and
tell
the
driver
to
take
you
home
only
through
the
large
and
well
-
lighted
thoroughfares
.
<EOS>
Do
this
;
and
you
and
your
money
will
be
safe
.
<EOS>
Do
this
;
and
to
-
morrow
you
will
thank
an
old
soldier
for
giving
you
a
word
of
honest
advice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Just
as
the
ex
-
brave
ended
his
oration
in
very
lachrymose
tones
,
the
coffee
came
in
,
ready
poured
out
in
two
cups
.
<EOS>
My
attentive
friend
handed
me
one
of
the
cups
with
a
bow
.
<EOS>
I
was
parched
with
thirst
,
and
drank
it
off
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
Almost
instantly
afterwards
,
I
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
giddiness
,
and
felt
more
completely
intoxicated
than
ever
.
<EOS>
The
room
whirled
round
and
round
furiously
;
the
old
soldier
seemed
to
be
regularly
bobbing
up
and
down
before
me
like
the
piston
of
a
steam
-
engine
.
<EOS>
I
was
half
deafened
by
a
violent
singing
in
my
ears
;
a
feeling
of
utter
bewilderment
,
helplessness
,
idiocy
,
overcame
me
.
<EOS>
I
rose
from
my
chair
,
holding
on
by
the
table
to
keep
my
balance
;
and
stammered
out
that
I
felt
dreadfully
unwell
 
<EOS>
so
unwell
that
I
did
not
know
how
I
was
to
get
home
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
,
"
answered
the
old
soldier
 
and
even
his
voice
seemed
to
be
bobbing
up
and
down
as
he
spoke
 
"
my
dear
friend
,
it
would
be
madness
to
go
home
in
your
state
;
you
would
be
sure
to
lose
your
money
;
you
might
be
robbed
and
murdered
with
the
greatest
ease
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
sleep
here
;
do
you
sleep
here
,
too
 
<EOS>
they
make
up
capital
beds
in
this
house
 
take
one
;
sleep
off
the
effects
of
the
wine
,
and
go
home
safely
with
your
winnings
to
-
morrow
 
to
-
morrow
,
in
broad
daylight
.
"
  
<EOS>
I
had
but
two
ideas
left
:
one
,
that
I
must
never
let
go
hold
of
my
handkerchief
full
of
money
;
<EOS>
the
other
,
that
I
must
lie
down
somewhere
immediately
,
and
fall
off
into
a
comfortable
sleep
.
<EOS>
So
I
agreed
to
the
proposal
about
the
bed
,
and
took
the
offered
arm
of
the
old
soldier
,
carrying
my
money
with
my
disengaged
hand
.
<EOS>
Preceded
by
the
croupier
,
we
passed
along
some
passages
and
up
a
flight
of
stairs
into
the
bedroom
which
I
was
to
occupy
.
<EOS>
The
ex
-
brave
shook
me
warmly
by
the
hand
,
proposed
that
we
should
breakfast
together
,
and
then
,
followed
by
the
croupier
,
left
me
for
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
I
ran
to
the
wash
-
hand
stand
;
drank
some
of
the
water
in
my
jug
;
poured
the
rest
out
,
and
plunged
my
face
into
it
;
then
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
tried
to
compose
myself
.
<EOS>
I
soon
felt
better
.
<EOS>
The
change
for
my
lungs
,
from
the
fetid
atmosphere
of
the
gambling
-
room
to
the
cool
air
of
the
apartment
I
now
occupied
,
the
almost
equally
refreshing
change
for
my
eyes
,
from
the
glaring
gaslights
of
the
"
salon
"
to
the
dim
,
quiet
flicker
of
one
bedroom
-
candle
,
aided
wonderfully
the
restorative
effects
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
The
giddiness
left
me
,
and
I
began
to
feel
a
little
like
a
reasonable
being
again
.
<EOS>
My
first
thought
was
of
the
risk
of
sleeping
all
night
in
a
gambling
-
house
;
my
second
,
of
the
still
greater
risk
of
trying
to
get
out
after
the
house
was
closed
,
and
of
going
home
alone
at
night
through
the
streets
of
Paris
with
a
large
sum
of
money
about
me
.
<EOS>
I
had
slept
in
worse
places
than
this
on
my
travels
;
so
I
determined
to
lock
,
bolt
,
and
barricade
my
door
,
and
take
my
chance
till
the
next
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
secured
myself
against
all
intrusion
;
looked
under
the
bed
,
and
into
the
cupboard
;
tried
the
fastening
of
the
window
;
and
then
,
satisfied
that
I
had
taken
every
proper
precaution
,
pulled
off
my
upper
clothing
,
put
my
light
,
which
was
a
dim
one
,
on
the
hearth
among
a
feathery
litter
of
wood
-
ashes
,
and
got
into
bed
,
with
the
handkerchief
full
of
money
under
my
pillow
.
  
<EOS>
I
soon
felt
not
only
that
I
could
not
go
to
sleep
,
but
that
I
could
not
even
close
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
was
wide
awake
,
and
in
a
high
fever
.
<EOS>
Every
nerve
in
my
body
trembled
 
<EOS>
every
one
of
my
senses
seemed
to
be
preternaturally
sharpened
.
<EOS>
I
tossed
and
rolled
,
and
tried
every
kind
of
position
,
and
perseveringly
sought
out
the
cold
corners
of
the
bed
,
and
all
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
Now
I
thrust
my
arms
over
the
clothes
;
now
I
poked
them
under
the
clothes
;
now
I
violently
shot
my
legs
straight
out
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
bed
;
now
I
convulsively
coiled
them
up
as
near
my
chin
as
they
would
go
;
now
I
shook
out
my
crumpled
pillow
,
changed
it
to
the
cool
side
,
patted
it
flat
,
and
lay
down
quietly
on
my
back
;
now
I
fiercely
doubled
it
in
two
,
set
it
up
on
end
,
thrust
it
against
the
board
of
the
bed
,
and
tried
a
sitting
posture
.
<EOS>
Every
effort
was
in
vain
;
I
groaned
with
vexation
as
I
felt
that
I
was
in
for
a
sleepless
night
.
  
<EOS>
What
could
I
do
?
<EOS>
I
had
no
book
to
read
.
<EOS>
And
yet
,
unless
I
found
out
some
method
of
diverting
my
mind
,
I
felt
certain
that
I
was
in
the
condition
to
imagine
all
sorts
of
horrors
;
to
rack
my
brain
with
forebodings
of
every
possible
and
impossible
danger
;
in
short
,
to
pass
the
night
in
suffering
all
conceivable
varieties
of
nervous
terror
.
  
<EOS>
I
raised
myself
on
my
elbow
,
and
looked
about
the
room
 
which
was
brightened
by
a
lovely
moonlight
pouring
straight
through
the
window
 
to
see
if
it
contained
any
pictures
or
ornaments
that
I
could
at
all
clearly
distinguish
.
<EOS>
While
my
eyes
wandered
from
wall
to
wall
,
a
remembrance
of
Le
Maistre
's
delightful
little
book
,
"
Voyage
autour
de
ma
Chambre
,
"
occurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
imitate
the
French
author
,
and
find
occupation
and
amusement
enough
to
relieve
the
tedium
of
my
wakefulness
,
by
making
a
mental
inventory
of
every
article
of
furniture
I
could
see
,
and
by
following
up
to
their
sources
the
multitude
of
associations
which
even
a
chair
,
a
table
,
or
a
wash
-
hand
stand
may
be
made
to
call
forth
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
nervous
unsettled
state
of
my
mind
at
that
moment
,
I
found
it
much
easier
to
make
my
inventory
than
to
make
my
reflections
,
and
thereupon
soon
gave
up
all
hope
of
thinking
in
Le
Maistre
's
fanciful
track
 
or
,
indeed
,
of
thinking
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
looked
about
the
room
at
the
different
articles
of
furniture
,
and
did
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
first
,
the
bed
I
was
lying
in
;
a
four
-
post
bed
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
to
meet
with
in
Paris
 
<EOS>
yes
,
a
thorough
clumsy
British
four
-
poster
,
with
the
regular
top
lined
with
chintz
 
<EOS>
the
regular
fringed
valance
all
round
 
the
regular
stifling
,
unwholesome
curtains
,
which
I
remembered
having
mechanically
drawn
back
against
the
posts
without
particularly
noticing
the
bed
when
I
first
got
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
Then
there
was
the
marble
-
topped
wash
-
hand
stand
,
from
which
the
water
I
had
spilled
,
in
my
hurry
to
pour
it
out
,
was
still
dripping
,
slowly
and
more
slowly
,
on
to
the
brick
floor
.
<EOS>
Then
two
small
chairs
,
with
my
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
trousers
flung
on
them
.
<EOS>
Then
a
large
elbow
-
chair
covered
with
dirty
-
white
dimity
,
with
my
cravat
and
shirt
collar
thrown
over
the
back
.
<EOS>
Then
a
chest
of
drawers
with
two
of
the
brass
handles
off
,
and
a
tawdry
,
broken
china
inkstand
placed
on
it
by
way
of
ornament
for
the
top
.
<EOS>
Then
the
dressing
-
table
,
adorned
by
a
very
small
looking
-
glass
,
and
a
very
large
pincushion
.
<EOS>
Then
the
window
 
an
unusually
large
window
.
<EOS>
Then
a
dark
old
picture
,
which
the
feeble
candle
dimly
showed
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
picture
of
a
fellow
in
a
high
Spanish
hat
,
crowned
with
a
plume
of
towering
feathers
.
<EOS>
A
swarthy
,
sinister
ruffian
,
looking
upward
,
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
,
and
looking
intently
upward
 
it
might
be
at
some
tall
gallows
at
which
he
was
going
to
be
hanged
.
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
had
the
appearance
of
thoroughly
deserving
it
.
  
<EOS>
This
picture
put
a
kind
of
constraint
upon
me
to
look
upward
too
 
at
the
top
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
gloomy
and
not
an
interesting
object
,
and
I
looked
back
at
the
picture
.
<EOS>
I
counted
the
feathers
in
the
man
's
hat
 
<EOS>
they
stood
out
in
relief
 
<EOS>
three
white
,
two
green
.
<EOS>
I
observed
the
crown
of
his
hat
,
which
was
of
conical
shape
,
according
to
the
fashion
supposed
to
have
been
favored
by
Guido
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
he
was
looking
up
at
.
<EOS>
It
could
n't
be
at
the
stars
;
such
a
desperado
was
neither
astrologer
nor
astronomer
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
at
the
high
gallows
,
and
he
was
going
to
be
hanged
presently
.
<EOS>
Would
the
executioner
come
into
possession
of
his
conical
crowned
hat
and
plume
of
feathers
?
<EOS>
I
counted
the
feathers
again
 
three
white
,
two
green
.
  
<EOS>
While
I
still
lingered
over
this
very
improving
and
intellectual
employment
,
my
thoughts
insensibly
began
to
wander
.
<EOS>
The
moonlight
shining
into
the
room
reminded
me
of
a
certain
moonlight
night
in
England
 
<EOS>
the
night
after
a
picnic
party
in
a
Welsh
valley
.
<EOS>
Every
incident
of
the
drive
homeward
,
through
lovely
scenery
,
which
the
moonlight
made
lovelier
than
ever
,
came
back
to
my
remembrance
,
though
I
had
never
given
the
picnic
a
thought
for
years
;
though
,
if
I
had
tried
to
recollect
it
,
I
could
certainly
have
recalled
little
or
nothing
of
that
scene
long
past
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
wonderful
faculties
that
help
to
tell
us
we
are
immortal
,
which
speaks
the
sublime
truth
more
eloquently
than
memory
?
<EOS>
Here
was
I
,
in
a
strange
house
of
the
most
suspicious
character
,
in
a
situation
of
uncertainty
,
and
even
of
peril
,
which
might
seem
to
make
the
cool
exercise
of
my
recollection
almost
out
of
the
question
;
nevertheless
,
remembering
,
quite
involuntarily
,
places
,
people
,
conversations
,
minute
circumstances
of
every
kind
,
which
I
had
thought
forgotten
forever
;
which
I
could
not
possibly
have
recalled
at
will
,
even
under
the
most
favorable
auspices
.
<EOS>
And
what
cause
had
produced
in
a
moment
the
whole
of
this
strange
,
complicated
,
mysterious
effect
?
<EOS>
Nothing
but
some
rays
of
moonlight
shining
in
at
my
bedroom
window
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
still
thinking
of
the
picnic
 
of
our
merriment
on
the
drive
home
 
of
the
sentimental
young
lady
who
would
quote
"
Childe
Harold
"
because
it
was
moonlight
.
<EOS>
I
was
absorbed
by
these
past
scenes
and
past
amusements
,
when
,
in
an
instant
,
the
thread
on
which
my
memories
hung
snapped
asunder
;
my
attention
immediately
came
back
to
present
things
more
vividly
than
ever
,
and
I
found
myself
<EOS>
,
I
neither
knew
why
nor
wherefore
,
looking
hard
at
the
picture
again
.
  
<EOS>
Looking
for
what
?
  
<EOS>
Good
God
!
<EOS>
the
man
had
pulled
his
hat
down
on
his
brows
!
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
the
hat
itself
was
gone
!
<EOS>
Where
was
the
conical
crown
?
<EOS>
Where
the
feathers
 
three
white
,
two
green
?
<EOS>
Not
there
!
<EOS>
In
place
of
the
hat
and
feathers
,
what
dusky
object
was
it
that
now
hid
his
forehead
,
his
eyes
,
his
shading
hand
?
  
<EOS>
Was
the
bed
moving
?
  
<EOS>
I
turned
on
my
back
and
looked
up
.
<EOS>
Was
I
mad
?
<EOS>
drunk
?
<EOS>
dreaming
?
<EOS>
giddy
again
?
<EOS>
or
was
the
top
of
the
bed
really
moving
down
 
sinking
slowly
,
regularly
,
silently
,
horribly
,
right
down
throughout
the
whole
of
its
length
and
breadth
 
right
down
upon
me
,
as
I
lay
underneath
?
  
<EOS>
My
blood
seemed
to
stand
still
.
<EOS>
A
deadly
paralysing
coldness
stole
all
over
me
as
I
turned
my
head
round
on
the
pillow
and
determined
to
test
whether
the
bed
-
top
was
really
moving
or
not
,
by
keeping
my
eye
on
the
man
in
the
picture
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
look
in
that
direction
was
enough
.
<EOS>
The
dull
,
black
,
frowzy
outline
of
the
valance
above
me
was
within
an
inch
of
being
parallel
with
his
waist
.
<EOS>
I
still
looked
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
And
steadily
and
slowly
 
very
slowly
 
I
saw
the
figure
,
and
the
line
of
frame
below
the
figure
,
vanish
,
as
the
valance
moved
down
before
it
.
  
<EOS>
I
am
,
constitutionally
,
anything
but
timid
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
on
more
than
one
occasion
in
peril
of
my
life
,
and
have
not
lost
my
self
-
possession
for
an
instant
;
but
when
the
conviction
first
settled
on
my
mind
that
the
bed
-
top
was
really
moving
,
was
steadily
and
continuously
sinking
down
upon
me
,
I
looked
up
shuddering
,
helpless
,
panic
-
stricken
,
beneath
the
hideous
machinery
for
murder
,
which
was
advancing
closer
and
closer
to
suffocate
me
where
I
lay
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
up
,
motionless
,
speechless
,
breathless
.
<EOS>
The
candle
,
fully
spent
,
went
out
;
but
the
moonlight
still
brightened
the
room
.
<EOS>
Down
and
down
,
without
pausing
and
without
sounding
,
came
the
bed
-
top
,
and
still
my
panic
-
terror
seemed
to
bind
me
faster
and
faster
to
the
mattress
on
which
I
lay
 
down
and
down
<EOS>
it
sank
,
till
the
dusty
odor
from
the
lining
of
the
canopy
came
stealing
into
my
nostrils
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
final
moment
the
instinct
of
self
-
preservation
startled
me
out
of
my
trance
,
and
I
moved
at
last
.
<EOS>
There
was
just
room
for
me
to
roll
myself
sidewise
off
the
bed
.
<EOS>
As
I
dropped
noiselessly
to
the
floor
,
the
edge
of
the
murderous
canopy
touched
me
on
the
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
Without
stopping
to
draw
my
breath
,
without
wiping
the
cold
sweat
from
my
face
,
I
rose
instantly
on
my
knees
to
watch
the
bed
-
top
.
<EOS>
I
was
literally
spellbound
by
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
heard
footsteps
behind
me
,
I
could
not
have
turned
round
;
if
a
means
of
escape
had
been
miraculously
provided
for
me
,
I
could
not
have
moved
to
take
advantage
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
whole
life
in
me
was
,
at
that
moment
,
concentrated
in
my
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
It
descended
 
the
whole
canopy
,
with
the
fringe
round
it
,
came
down
 
down
 
close
down
;
so
close
that
there
was
not
room
now
to
squeeze
my
finger
between
the
bed
-
top
and
the
bed
.
<EOS>
I
felt
at
the
sides
,
and
discovered
that
what
had
appeared
to
me
from
beneath
to
be
the
ordinary
light
canopy
of
a
four
-
post
bed
was
in
reality
a
thick
,
broad
mattress
,
the
substance
of
which
was
concealed
by
the
valance
and
its
fringe
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
and
saw
the
four
posts
rising
hideously
bare
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
bed
-
top
was
a
huge
wooden
screw
that
had
evidently
worked
it
down
through
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
,
just
as
ordinary
presses
are
worked
down
on
the
substance
selected
for
compression
.
<EOS>
The
frightful
apparatus
moved
without
making
the
faintest
noise
.
<EOS>
There
had
been
no
creaking
as
it
came
down
;
there
was
now
not
the
faintest
sound
from
the
room
above
.
<EOS>
Amid
a
dead
and
awful
silence
I
beheld
before
me
 
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
in
the
civilized
capital
of
France
 
such
a
machine
for
secret
murder
by
suffocation
as
might
have
existed
in
the
worst
days
of
the
Inquisition
,
in
the
lonely
inns
among
the
Hartz
Mountains
,
in
the
mysterious
tribunals
of
Westphalia
!
<EOS>
Still
,
as
I
looked
on
it
,
I
could
not
move
,
I
could
hardly
breathe
,
but
I
began
to
recover
the
power
of
thinking
,
and
in
a
moment
I
discovered
the
murderous
conspiracy
framed
against
me
in
all
its
horror
.
  
<EOS>
My
cup
of
coffee
had
been
drugged
,
and
drugged
too
strongly
.
<EOS>
I
had
been
saved
from
being
smothered
by
having
taken
an
overdose
of
some
narcotic
.
<EOS>
How
I
had
chafed
and
fretted
at
the
fever
fit
which
had
preserved
my
life
by
keeping
me
awake
!
<EOS>
How
recklessly
I
had
confided
myself
to
the
two
wretches
who
had
led
me
into
this
room
,
determined
,
for
the
sake
of
my
winnings
,
to
kill
me
in
my
sleep
by
the
surest
and
most
horrible
contrivance
for
secretly
accomplishing
my
destruction
!
<EOS>
How
many
men
,
winners
like
me
,
had
slept
,
as
 
I
had
proposed
to
sleep
,
in
that
bed
,
and
had
never
been
seen
or
heard
of
more
!
<EOS>
I
shuddered
at
the
bare
idea
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
ere
long
,
all
thought
was
again
suspended
by
the
sight
of
the
murderous
canopy
moving
once
more
.
<EOS>
After
it
had
remained
on
the
bed
 
as
nearly
as
I
could
guess
 
about
ten
minutes
,
it
began
to
move
up
again
.
<EOS>
The
villains
who
worked
it
from
above
evidently
believed
that
their
purpose
was
now
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Slowly
and
silently
,
as
it
had
descended
,
that
horrible
bed
-
top
rose
towards
its
former
place
.
<EOS>
When
it
reached
the
upper
extremities
of
the
four
posts
,
it
reached
the
ceiling
,
too
.
<EOS>
Neither
hole
nor
screw
could
be
seen
;
the
bed
became
in
appearance
an
ordinary
bed
again
 
<EOS>
the
canopy
an
ordinary
canopy
 
<EOS>
even
to
the
most
suspicious
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
for
the
first
time
,
I
was
able
to
move
 
to
rise
from
my
knees
 
to
dress
myself
in
my
upper
clothing
 
and
to
consider
of
how
I
should
escape
.
<EOS>
If
I
betrayed
by
the
smallest
noise
that
the
attempt
to
suffocate
me
had
failed
,
I
was
certain
to
be
murdered
.
<EOS>
Had
I
made
any
noise
already
?
<EOS>
I
listened
intently
,
looking
towards
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
footsteps
in
the
passage
outside
 
no
sound
of
a
tread
,
light
or
heavy
,
in
the
room
above
 
absolute
silence
everywhere
.
<EOS>
Besides
locking
and
bolting
my
door
,
I
had
moved
an
old
wooden
chest
against
it
,
which
I
had
found
under
the
bed
.
<EOS>
To
remove
this
chest
(
my
blood
ran
cold
as
I
thought
of
what
its
contents
might
be
!
)
<EOS>
without
making
some
disturbance
was
impossible
;
and
,
moreover
,
to
think
of
escaping
through
the
house
,
now
barred
up
for
the
night
,
was
sheer
insanity
.
<EOS>
Only
one
chance
was
left
me
 
the
window
.
<EOS>
I
stole
to
it
on
tiptoe
.
  
<EOS>
My
bedroom
was
on
the
first
floor
,
above
an
entresol
,
and
looked
into
a
back
street
,
which
you
have
sketched
in
your
view
.
<EOS>
I
raised
my
hand
to
open
the
window
,
knowing
that
on
that
action
hung
,
by
the
merest
hair
-
breadth
,
my
chance
of
safety
.
<EOS>
They
keep
vigilant
watch
in
a
House
of
Murder
.
<EOS>
If
any
part
of
the
frame
cracked
,
if
the
hinge
creaked
,
I
was
a
lost
man
!
<EOS>
It
must
have
occupied
me
at
least
five
minutes
,
reckoning
by
time
 
five
hours
,
reckoning
by
suspense
 
to
open
that
window
.
<EOS>
I
succeeded
in
doing
it
silently
 
in
doing
it
with
all
the
dexterity
of
a
house
-
breaker
 
and
then
looked
down
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
To
leap
the
distance
beneath
me
would
be
almost
certain
destruction
!
<EOS>
Next
,
I
looked
round
at
the
sides
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Down
the
left
side
ran
a
thick
water
-
pipe
which
you
have
drawn
 
<EOS>
it
passed
close
by
the
outer
edge
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
moment
I
saw
the
pipe
I
knew
I
was
saved
.
<EOS>
My
breath
came
and
went
freely
for
the
first
time
since
I
had
seen
the
canopy
of
the
bed
moving
down
upon
me
!
  
<EOS>
To
some
men
the
means
of
escape
which
I
had
discovered
might
have
seemed
difficult
and
dangerous
enough
 
to
me
the
prospect
of
slipping
down
the
pipe
into
the
street
did
not
suggest
even
a
thought
of
peril
.
<EOS>
I
had
always
been
accustomed
,
by
the
practice
of
gymnastics
,
to
keep
up
my
school
-
boy
powers
as
a
daring
and
expert
climber
;
and
knew
that
my
head
,
hands
,
and
feet
would
serve
me
faithfully
in
any
hazards
of
ascent
or
descent
.
<EOS>
I
had
already
got
one
leg
over
the
window
-
sill
,
when
I
remembered
the
handkerchief
filled
with
money
under
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
I
could
well
have
afforded
to
leave
it
behind
me
,
but
I
was
revengefully
determined
that
the
miscreants
of
the
gambling
-
house
should
miss
their
plunder
as
well
as
their
victim
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
back
to
the
bed
and
tied
the
heavy
handkerchief
at
my
back
by
my
cravat
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
I
had
made
it
tight
and
fixed
it
in
a
comfortable
place
,
I
thought
I
heard
a
sound
of
breathing
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
chill
feeling
of
horror
ran
through
me
again
as
I
listened
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
dead
silence
still
in
the
passage
 
<EOS>
I
had
only
heard
the
night
air
blowing
softly
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
I
was
on
the
window
-
sill
 
<EOS>
and
the
next
I
had
a
firm
grip
on
the
water
-
pipe
with
my
hands
and
knees
.
  
<EOS>
I
slid
down
into
the
street
easily
and
quietly
,
as
I
thought
I
should
,
and
immediately
set
off
at
the
top
of
my
speed
to
a
branch
"
Prefecture
"
of
Police
,
which
I
knew
was
situated
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
A
"
Sub
-
prefect
,
"
and
several
picked
men
among
his
subordinates
,
happened
to
be
up
,
maturing
,
I
believe
,
some
scheme
for
discovering
the
perpetrator
of
a
mysterious
murder
which
all
Paris
was
talking
of
just
then
.
<EOS>
When
I
began
my
story
,
in
a
breathless
hurry
and
in
very
bad
French
,
I
could
see
that
the
Sub
-
prefect
suspected
me
of
being
a
drunken
Englishman
who
had
robbed
somebody
;
but
he
soon
altered
his
opinion
as
I
went
on
,
and
before
I
had
anything
like
concluded
,
he
shoved
all
the
papers
before
him
into
a
drawer
,
put
on
his
hat
,
supplied
me
with
another
(
for
I
was
bareheaded
)
,
ordered
a
file
of
soldiers
,
desired
his
expert
followers
to
get
ready
all
sorts
of
tools
for
breaking
open
doors
and
ripping
up
brick
flooring
,
and
took
my
arm
,
in
the
most
friendly
and
familiar
manner
possible
,
to
lead
me
with
him
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
will
venture
to
say
that
when
the
Sub
-
prefect
was
a
little
boy
,
and
was
taken
for
the
first
time
to
the
play
,
he
was
not
half
as
much
pleased
as
he
was
now
at
the
job
in
prospect
for
him
at
the
gambling
-
house
!
  
<EOS>
Away
we
went
through
the
streets
,
the
Sub
-
prefect
cross
-
examining
and
congratulating
me
in
the
same
breath
as
we
marched
at
the
head
of
our
formidable
posse
comitatus
.
<EOS>
Sentinels
were
placed
at
the
back
and
front
of
the
house
the
moment
we
got
to
it
;
a
tremendous
battery
of
knocks
was
directed
against
the
door
;
a
light
appeared
at
a
window
;
I
was
told
to
conceal
myself
behind
the
police
 
then
came
more
knocks
and
a
cry
of
"
Open
in
the
name
of
the
law
!
"
<EOS>
At
that
terrible
summons
bolts
and
locks
gave
way
before
an
invisible
hand
,
and
the
moment
after
the
Sub
-
prefect
was
in
the
passage
,
confronting
a
waiter
half
-
dressed
and
ghastly
pale
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
short
dialogue
which
immediately
took
place
:
  
<EOS>
"
We
want
to
see
the
Englishman
who
is
sleeping
in
this
house
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
went
away
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
did
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
His
friend
went
away
;
he
remained
.
<EOS>
Show
us
to
his
bedroom
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
swear
to
you
,
Monsieur
le
Sous
-
prefect
,
he
is
not
here
!
<EOS>
he
"
  
"
I
swear
to
you
,
Monsieur
le
Garcon
,
he
is
.
<EOS>
He
slept
here
 
<EOS>
he
did
n't
find
your
bed
comfortable
 
<EOS>
he
came
to
us
to
complain
of
it
 
here
he
is
among
my
men
 
and
here
am
I
ready
to
look
for
a
flea
or
two
in
his
bedstead
.
<EOS>
Renaudin
!
<EOS>
(
calling
to
one
of
the
subordinates
,
and
pointing
to
the
waiter
)
collar
that
man
and
tie
his
hands
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
gentlemen
,
let
us
walk
upstairs
!
"
  
<EOS>
Every
man
and
woman
in
the
house
was
secured
 
the
"
Old
Soldier
"
the
first
.
<EOS>
Then
I
identified
the
bed
in
which
I
had
slept
,
and
then
we
went
into
the
room
above
.
  
<EOS>
No
object
that
was
at
all
extraordinary
appeared
in
any
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
Sub
-
prefect
looked
round
the
place
,
commanded
everybody
to
be
silent
,
stamped
twice
on
the
floor
,
called
for
a
candle
,
looked
attentively
at
the
spot
he
had
stamped
on
,
and
ordered
the
flooring
there
to
be
carefully
taken
up
.
<EOS>
This
was
done
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
Lights
were
produced
,
and
we
saw
a
deep
raftered
cavity
between
the
floor
of
this
room
and
the
ceiling
of
the
room
beneath
.
<EOS>
Through
this
cavity
there
ran
perpendicularly
a
sort
of
case
of
iron
thickly
greased
;
and
inside
the
case
appeared
the
screw
,
which
communicated
with
the
bed
-
top
below
.
<EOS>
Extra
lengths
of
screw
,
freshly
oiled
;
levers
covered
with
felt
;
all
the
complete
upper
works
of
a
heavy
press
 
constructed
with
infernal
ingenuity
so
as
to
join
the
fixtures
below
,
and
when
taken
to
pieces
again
,
to
go
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
 
were
next
discovered
and
pulled
out
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
After
some
little
difficulty
the
Sub
-
prefect
succeeded
in
putting
the
machinery
together
,
and
,
leaving
his
men
to
work
it
,
descended
with
me
to
the
bedroom
.
<EOS>
The
smothering
canopy
was
then
lowered
,
but
not
so
noiselessly
as
I
had
seen
it
lowered
.
<EOS>
When
I
mentioned
this
to
the
Sub
-
prefect
,
his
answer
,
simple
as
it
was
,
had
a
terrible
significance
.
<EOS>
"
My
men
,
"
said
he
,
"
are
working
down
the
bed
-
top
for
the
first
time
 
<EOS>
the
men
whose
money
you
won
were
in
better
practice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
We
left
the
house
in
the
sole
possession
of
two
police
agents
 
<EOS>
every
one
of
the
inmates
being
removed
to
prison
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
Sub
-
prefect
,
after
taking
down
my
"
proces
verbal
"
in
his
office
,
returned
with
me
to
my
hotel
to
get
my
passport
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
,
"
I
asked
,
as
I
gave
it
to
him
,
"
that
any
men
have
really
been
smothered
in
that
bed
,
as
they
tried
to
smother
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
dozens
of
drowned
men
laid
out
at
the
Morgue
,
"
answered
the
Sub
-
prefect
,
"
in
whose
pocket
-
books
were
found
letters
stating
that
they
had
committed
suicide
in
the
Seine
,
because
they
had
lost
everything
at
the
gaming
table
.
<EOS>
Do
I
know
how
many
of
those
men
entered
the
same
gambling
-
house
that
you
entered
?
<EOS>
won
as
you
won
?
<EOS>
took
that
bed
as
you
took
it
?
<EOS>
slept
in
it
?
<EOS>
were
smothered
in
it
?
and
were
privately
thrown
into
the
river
,
with
a
letter
of
explanation
written
by
the
murderers
and
placed
in
their
pocket
-
books
?
<EOS>
No
man
can
say
how
many
or
how
few
have
suffered
the
fate
from
which
you
have
escaped
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
gambling
-
house
kept
their
bedstead
machinery
a
secret
from
us
 
even
from
the
police
!
<EOS>
The
dead
kept
the
rest
of
the
secret
for
them
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
,
or
rather
good
-
morning
,
Monsieur
Faulkner
!
<EOS>
Be
at
my
office
again
at
nine
o'clock
 
in
the
meantime
,
au
revoir
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
my
story
is
soon
told
.
<EOS>
I
was
examined
and
re
-
examined
;
the
gambling
-
house
was
strictly
searched
all
through
from
top
to
bottom
;
the
prisoners
were
separately
interrogated
;
and
two
of
the
less
guilty
among
them
made
a
confession
.
<EOS>
I
discovered
that
the
Old
Soldier
was
the
master
of
the
gambling
-
house
 
justice
discovered
that
he
had
been
drummed
out
of
the
army
as
a
vagabond
years
ago
;
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
all
sorts
of
villainies
since
;
that
he
was
in
possession
of
stolen
property
,
which
the
owners
identified
;
and
that
he
,
the
croupier
,
another
accomplice
,
and
the
woman
who
had
made
my
cup
of
coffee
,
were
all
in
the
secret
of
the
bedstead
.
<EOS>
There
appeared
some
reason
to
doubt
whether
the
inferior
persons
attached
to
the
house
knew
anything
of
the
suffocating
machinery
;
and
they
received
the
benefit
of
that
doubt
,
by
being
treated
simply
as
thieves
and
vagabonds
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
Old
Soldier
and
his
two
head
myrmidons
,
they
went
to
the
galleys
;
the
woman
who
had
drugged
my
coffee
was
imprisoned
for
I
forget
how
many
years
;
the
regular
attendants
at
the
gambling
-
house
were
considered
"
suspicious
"
and
placed
under
"
surveillance
"
;
and
I
became
,
for
one
whole
week
(
which
is
a
long
time
)
<EOS>
the
head
"
lion
"
in
Parisian
society
.
<EOS>
My
adventure
was
dramatized
by
three
illustrious
play
-
makers
,
but
never
saw
theatrical
daylight
;
for
the
censorship
forbade
the
introduction
on
the
stage
of
a
correct
copy
of
the
gambling
-
house
bedstead
.
  
<EOS>
One
good
result
was
produced
by
my
adventure
,
which
any
censorship
must
have
approved
:
it
cured
me
of
ever
again
trying
"
Rouge
et
Noir
"
as
an
amusement
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
a
green
cloth
,
with
packs
of
cards
and
heaps
of
money
on
it
,
will
henceforth
be
forever
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
sight
of
a
bed
canopy
descending
to
suffocate
me
in
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
Mr.
Faulkner
pronounced
these
words
he
started
in
his
chair
,
and
resumed
his
stiff
,
dignified
position
in
a
great
hurry
.
<EOS>
"
Bless
my
soul
!
"
<EOS>
cried
he
,
with
a
comic
look
of
astonishment
and
vexation
,
"
while
I
have
been
telling
you
what
is
the
real
secret
of
my
interest
in
the
sketch
you
have
so
kindly
given
to
me
,
I
have
altogether
forgotten
that
I
came
here
to
sit
for
my
portrait
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
hour
or
more
I
must
have
been
the
worst
model
you
ever
had
to
draw
from
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
you
have
been
the
best
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
trying
to
catch
your
likeness
;
and
,
while
telling
your
story
,
you
have
unconsciously
shown
me
the
natural
expression
I
wanted
to
insure
my
success
.

NOTE
BY
MRS
.
KERBY
.
  
<EOS>
I
can
not
let
this
story
end
without
mentioning
what
the
chance
saying
was
which
caused
it
to
be
told
at
the
farmhouse
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
Our
friend
the
young
sailor
,
among
his
other
quaint
objections
to
sleeping
on
shore
,
declared
that
he
particularly
hated
four
-
post
beds
,
because
he
never
slept
in
one
without
doubting
whether
the
top
might
not
come
down
in
the
night
and
suffocate
him
.
<EOS>
I
thought
this
chance
reference
to
the
distinguishing
feature
of
William
's
narrative
curious
enough
,
and
my
husband
agreed
with
me
.
<EOS>
But
he
says
it
is
scarcely
worth
while
to
mention
such
a
trifle
in
anything
so
important
as
a
book
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
venture
,
after
this
,
to
do
more
than
slip
these
lines
in
modestly
at
the
end
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
If
the
printer
should
notice
my
few
last
words
,
perhaps
he
may
not
mind
the
trouble
of
putting
them
into
some
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
corner

PROLOGUE
TO
THE
SECOND
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
The
beginning
of
an
excellent
connection
which
I
succeeded
in
establishing
in
and
around
that
respectable
watering
-
place
,
Tidbury
-
on
-
the
-
Marsh
,
was
an
order
for
a
life
-
size
oil
portrait
of
a
great
local
celebrity
 
<EOS>
one
Mr.
Boxsious
,
a
solicitor
,
who
was
understood
to
do
the
most
thriving
business
of
any
lawyer
in
the
town
.
  
<EOS>
The
portrait
was
intended
as
a
testimonial
"
expressive
(
to
use
the
language
of
the
circular
forwarded
to
me
at
the
time
)
of
the
eminent
services
of
Mr.
Boxsious
in
promoting
and
securing
the
prosperity
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
It
had
been
subscribed
for
by
the
"
Municipal
Authorities
and
Resident
Inhabitants
"
of
Tidbury
-
on
-
the
-
Marsh
;
and
it
was
to
be
presented
,
when
done
,
to
Mrs.
Boxsious
,
"
as
a
slight
but
sincere
token
"
 
a
nd
so
forth
.
<EOS>
A
timely
recommendation
from
one
of
my
kindest
friends
and
patrons
placed
the
commission
for
painting
the
likeness
in
my
lucky
hands
;
and
I
was
instructed
to
attend
on
a
certain
day
at
Mr.
Boxsious
's
private
residence
,
with
all
my
materials
ready
for
taking
a
first
sitting
.
  
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
house
,
I
was
shown
into
a
very
prettily
furnished
morning
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
bow
-
window
looked
out
on
a
large
inclosed
meadow
,
which
represented
the
principal
square
in
Tidbury
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
side
of
the
meadow
I
could
see
the
new
hotel
(
with
a
wing
lately
added
)
,
and
close
by
,
the
old
hotel
obstinately
unchanged
since
it
had
first
been
built
.
<EOS>
Then
,
further
down
the
street
,
the
doctor
's
house
,
with
a
colored
lamp
and
a
small
door
-
plate
,
and
the
banker
's
office
,
with
a
plain
lamp
and
a
big
door
-
plate
 
then
some
dreary
private
lodging
-
houses
 
then
,
at
right
angles
to
these
,
a
street
of
shops
;
the
cheese
-
monger
's
very
small
,
the
chemist
's
very
smart
,
the
pastry
-
cook
's
very
dowdy
,
and
the
green
-
grocer
's
very
dark
,
I
was
still
looking
out
at
the
view
thus
presented
,
when
I
was
suddenly
apostrophized
by
a
glib
,
disputatious
voice
behind
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
then
,
Mr.
Artist
,
"
cried
the
voice
,
"
do
you
call
that
getting
ready
for
work
?
<EOS>
Where
are
your
paints
and
brushes
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
?
<EOS>
My
name
's
Boxsious
,
and
I
'm
here
to
sit
for
my
picture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
turned
round
,
and
confronted
a
little
man
with
his
legs
astraddle
,
and
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
He
had
light
-
gray
eyes
,
red
all
round
the
lids
,
bristling
pepper
-
colored
hair
,
an
unnaturally
rosy
complexion
,
and
an
eager
,
impudent
,
clever
look
.
<EOS>
I
made
two
discoveries
in
one
glance
at
him
:
<EOS>
First
,
that
he
was
a
wretched
subject
for
a
portrait
;
secondly
,
that
,
whatever
he
might
do
or
say
,
it
would
not
be
of
the
least
use
for
me
to
stand
on
my
dignity
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
ready
directly
,
sir
,
"
said
I.
  
<EOS>
"
Ready
directly
?
"
repeated
my
new
sitter
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Artist
,
by
ready
directly
?
<EOS>
I
'm
ready
now
.
<EOS>
What
was
your
contract
with
the
Town
Council
,
who
have
subscribed
for
this
picture
?
<EOS>
To
paint
the
portrait
.
<EOS>
And
what
was
my
contract
?
<EOS>
To
sit
for
it
.
<EOS>
Here
am
I
ready
to
sit
,
and
there
are
you
not
ready
to
paint
me
.
<EOS>
According
to
all
the
rules
of
law
and
logic
,
you
are
committing
a
breach
of
contract
already
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
let
's
have
a
look
at
your
paints
.
<EOS>
Are
they
the
best
quality
?
<EOS>
If
not
,
I
warn
you
,
sir
,
there
's
a
second
breach
of
contract
!
<EOS>
Brushes
,
too
?
<EOS>
Why
,
they
're
old
brushes
,
by
the
Lord
Harry
!
<EOS>
The
Town
Council
pays
you
well
,
Mr.
Artist
;
why
do
n't
you
work
for
them
with
new
brushes
?
<EOS>
What
?
<EOS>
you
work
best
with
old
?
<EOS>
I
contend
,
sir
,
that
you
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
Does
my
housemaid
clean
best
with
an
old
broom
?
<EOS>
Do
my
clerks
write
best
with
old
pens
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
color
up
,
and
do
n't
look
as
if
you
were
going
to
quarrel
with
me
!
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
quarrel
with
me
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
fifty
times
as
irritable
a
man
as
you
look
,
you
could
n't
quarrel
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
young
,
and
I
'm
not
touchy
 
<EOS>
I
'm
Boxsious
,
the
lawyer
;
the
only
man
in
the
world
who
ca
n't
be
insulted
,
try
it
how
you
like
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
chuckled
as
he
said
this
,
and
walked
away
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
useless
to
take
anything
he
said
seriously
,
so
I
finished
preparing
my
palette
for
the
morning
's
work
with
the
utmost
serenity
of
look
and
manner
that
I
could
possibly
assume
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
he
went
on
,
looking
out
of
the
window
;
"
do
you
see
that
fat
man
slouching
along
the
Parade
,
with
a
snuffy
nose
?
<EOS>
That
's
my
favorite
enemy
,
Dunball
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
quarrel
with
me
ten
years
ago
,
and
he
has
done
nothing
but
bring
out
the
hidden
benevolence
of
my
character
ever
since
.
<EOS>
Look
at
him
!
<EOS>
look
how
he
frowns
as
he
turns
this
way
.
<EOS>
And
now
look
at
me
!
<EOS>
I
can
smile
and
nod
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
make
a
point
of
always
smiling
and
nodding
to
him
 
<EOS>
it
keeps
my
hand
in
for
other
enemies
.
<EOS>
Good
-
morning
!
<EOS>
(
I
've
cast
him
twice
in
heavy
damages
)
<EOS>
good
-
morning
,
Mr.
Dunball
.
<EOS>
He
bears
malice
,
you
see
;
he
wo
n't
speak
;
he
's
short
in
the
neck
,
passionate
,
and
four
times
as
fat
as
he
ought
to
be
;
he
has
fought
against
my
amiability
for
ten
mortal
years
;
when
he
ca
n't
fight
any
longer
,
he
'll
die
suddenly
,
and
I
shall
be
the
innocent
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Boxsious
uttered
this
fatal
prophecy
with
extraordinary
complacency
,
nodding
and
smiling
out
of
the
window
all
the
time
at
the
unfortunate
man
who
had
rashly
tried
to
provoke
him
.
<EOS>
When
his
favorite
enemy
was
out
of
sight
,
he
turned
away
,
and
indulged
himself
in
a
brisk
turn
or
two
up
and
down
the
room
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
I
lifted
my
canvas
on
the
easel
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
asking
him
to
sit
down
,
when
he
assailed
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr.
Artist
,
"
he
cried
,
quickening
his
walk
impatiently
,
"
in
the
interests
of
the
Town
Council
,
your
employers
,
allow
me
to
ask
you
for
the
last
time
when
you
are
going
to
begin
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
allow
me
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Boxsious
,
in
the
interest
of
the
Town
Council
also
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
ask
you
if
your
notion
of
the
proper
way
of
sitting
for
your
portrait
is
to
walk
about
the
room
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
well
put
 
devilish
<EOS>
well
put
!
"
returned
Mr.
Boxsious
;
"
that
's
the
only
sensible
thing
you
have
said
since
you
entered
my
house
;
I
begin
to
like
you
already
.
<EOS>
"
With
these
words
he
nodded
at
me
approvingly
,
and
jumped
into
the
high
chair
that
I
had
placed
for
him
with
the
alacrity
of
a
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
Mr.
Artist
,
"
he
went
on
,
when
I
had
put
him
into
the
right
position
<EOS>
(
he
insisted
on
the
front
view
of
his
face
being
taken
,
because
the
Town
Council
would
get
the
most
for
their
money
in
that
way
)
,
"
you
do
n't
have
many
such
good
jobs
as
this
,
do
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
many
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
be
a
poor
man
if
commissions
for
life
-
size
portraits
often
fell
in
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
You
poor
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Boxsious
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
I
dispute
that
point
with
you
at
the
outset
.
<EOS>
Why
,
you
've
got
a
good
cloth
coat
,
a
clean
shirt
,
and
a
smooth
-
shaved
chin
.
<EOS>
You
've
got
the
sleek
look
of
a
man
who
has
slept
between
sheets
and
had
his
breakfast
.
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
humbug
me
about
poverty
,
for
I
know
what
it
is
.
<EOS>
Poverty
means
looking
like
a
scarecrow
,
feeling
like
a
scarecrow
,
and
getting
treated
like
a
scarecrow
.
<EOS>
That
was
my
luck
,
let
me
tell
you
,
when
I
first
thought
of
trying
the
law
.
<EOS>
Poverty
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Do
you
shake
in
your
shoes
,
Mr.
Artist
,
when
you
think
what
you
were
at
twenty
?
<EOS>
I
do
,
I
can
promise
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
began
to
shift
about
so
irritably
in
his
chair
,
that
,
in
the
interests
of
my
work
,
I
was
obliged
to
make
an
effort
to
calm
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
a
pleasant
occupation
for
you
in
your
present
prosperity
,
"
said
I
,
"
to
look
back
sometimes
at
the
gradual
processes
by
which
you
passed
from
poverty
to
competence
,
and
from
that
to
the
wealth
you
now
enjoy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gradual
,
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Mr.
Boxsious
;
"
it
was
n't
gradual
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
was
sharp
 
damned
sharp
,
and
I
jumped
at
my
first
start
in
business
slap
into
five
hundred
pounds
in
one
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
an
extraordinary
step
in
advance
,
"
I
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
you
contrived
to
make
some
profitable
investment
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
of
it
!
<EOS>
I
had
n't
a
spare
sixpence
to
invest
with
.
<EOS>
I
won
the
money
by
my
brains
,
my
hands
,
and
my
pluck
;
and
,
what
's
more
,
I
'm
proud
of
having
done
it
.
<EOS>
That
was
rather
a
curious
case
,
Mr.
Artist
.
<EOS>
Some
men
might
be
shy
of
mentioning
it
;
I
never
was
shy
in
my
life
<EOS>
and
I
mention
it
right
and
left
everywhere
 
<EOS>
the
whole
case
,
just
as
it
happened
,
except
the
names
.
<EOS>
Catch
me
ever
committing
myself
to
mentioning
names
!
<EOS>
Mum
's
the
word
,
sir
,
with
yours
to
command
,
Thomas
Boxsious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
you
mention
"
the
case
"
everywhere
,
"
said
I
,
"
perhaps
you
would
not
be
offended
with
me
if
I
told
you
I
should
like
to
hear
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Man
alive
!
<EOS>
have
n't
I
told
you
already
that
I
ca
n't
be
offended
?
<EOS>
And
did
n't
I
say
a
moment
ago
that
I
was
proud
of
the
case
?
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
,
Mr.
Artist
 
but
stop
!
<EOS>
I
've
got
the
interests
of
the
Town
Council
to
look
after
in
this
business
.
<EOS>
Can
you
paint
as
well
when
I
'm
talking
as
when
I
'm
not
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
sneer
,
sir
;
you
're
not
wanted
to
sneer
 
<EOS>
you
're
wanted
to
give
an
answer
 
yes
or
no
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
then
,
"
I
replied
,
in
his
own
sharp
way
.
<EOS>

THE
LAWYER
'S
<EOS>
STORY
  
OF
  
A
STOLEN
LETTER
.
  
<EOS>
I
served
my
time
 
<EOS>
never
mind
in
whose
office
 
<EOS>
and
I
started
in
business
for
myself
in
one
of
our
English
country
towns
<EOS>
,
I
decline
stating
which
.
<EOS>
I
had
n't
a
farthing
of
capital
,
and
my
friends
in
the
neighborhood
were
poor
and
useless
enough
,
with
one
exception
.
<EOS>
That
exception
was
Mr.
Frank
Gatliffe
,
son
of
Mr.
Gatliffe
,
member
for
the
county
,
the
richest
man
and
the
proudest
for
many
a
mile
round
about
our
parts
.
<EOS>
Stop
a
bit
,
Mr.
Artist
,
you
need
n't
perk
up
and
look
knowing
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
trace
any
particulars
by
the
name
of
Gatliffe
.
<EOS>
I
'm
not
bound
to
commit
myself
or
anybody
else
by
mentioning
names
.
<EOS>
I
have
given
you
the
first
that
came
into
my
head
.
  
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Frank
was
a
stanch
friend
of
mine
,
and
ready
to
recommend
me
whenever
he
got
the
chance
.
<EOS>
I
had
contrived
to
get
him
a
little
timely
help
 
for
a
consideration
,
of
course
 
in
borrowing
money
at
a
fair
rate
of
interest
;
in
fact
,
I
had
saved
him
from
the
Jews
.
<EOS>
The
money
was
borrowed
while
Mr.
Frank
was
at
college
.
<EOS>
He
came
back
from
college
,
and
stopped
at
home
a
little
while
,
and
then
there
got
spread
about
all
our
neighborhood
a
report
that
he
had
fallen
in
love
,
as
the
saying
is
,
with
his
young
sister
's
governess
,
and
that
his
mind
was
made
up
to
marry
her
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
're
at
it
again
,
Mr.
Artist
!
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
her
name
,
do
n't
you
?
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
Smith
?
  
<EOS>
Speaking
as
a
lawyer
,
I
consider
report
,
in
a
general
way
,
to
be
a
fool
and
a
liar
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
case
report
turned
out
to
be
something
very
different
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
told
me
he
was
really
in
love
,
and
said
upon
his
honor
(
an
absurd
expression
which
young
chaps
of
his
age
are
always
using
)
he
was
determined
to
marry
Smith
,
the
governess
 
<EOS>
the
sweet
,
darling
girl
,
as
he
called
her
;
but
I
'm
not
sentimental
,
and
I
call
her
Smith
,
the
governess
.
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Frank
's
father
,
being
as
proud
as
Lucifer
,
said
"
No
,
"
as
to
marrying
the
governess
,
when
Mr.
Frank
wanted
him
to
say
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
"
He
was
a
man
of
business
,
was
old
Gatliffe
,
and
he
took
the
proper
business
course
.
<EOS>
He
sent
the
governess
away
with
a
first
-
rate
character
and
a
spanking
present
,
and
then
he
,
looked
about
him
to
get
something
for
Mr.
Frank
to
do
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
looking
about
,
Mr.
Frank
bolted
to
London
after
the
governess
,
who
had
nobody
alive
belonging
to
her
to
go
to
but
an
aunt
 
her
father
's
sister
.
<EOS>
The
aunt
refuses
to
let
Mr.
Frank
in
without
the
squire
's
permission
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Frank
writes
to
his
father
,
and
says
he
will
marry
the
girl
as
soon
as
he
is
of
age
,
or
shoot
himself
.
<EOS>
Up
to
town
comes
the
squire
and
his
wife
and
his
daughter
,
and
a
lot
of
sentimentality
,
not
in
the
slightest
degree
material
to
the
present
statement
,
takes
places
among
them
;
and
the
upshot
of
it
is
that
old
Gatliffe
is
forced
into
withdrawing
the
word
<EOS>
No
,
and
substituting
the
word
<EOS>
Yes
.
  
<EOS>
I
do
n't
believe
he
would
ever
have
done
it
,
though
,
but
for
one
lucky
peculiarity
in
the
case
.
<EOS>
The
governess
's
father
was
a
man
of
good
family
 
pretty
nigh
as
good
as
Gatliffe
's
own
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
the
army
;
had
sold
out
;
set
up
as
a
wine
-
merchant
 
failed
 
died
;
ditto
his
wife
,
as
to
the
dying
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
No
relation
,
in
fact
,
left
for
the
squire
to
make
inquiries
about
but
<EOS>
the
father
's
sister
 
who
had
behaved
,
as
old
Gatliffe
said
,
like
a
thorough
-
bred
gentlewoman
in
shutting
the
door
against
Mr.
Frank
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
So
,
to
cut
the
matter
short
,
things
were
at
last
made
up
pleasant
enough
.
<EOS>
The
time
was
fixed
for
the
wedding
,
and
an
announcement
about
it
 
Marriage
in
High
Life
and
all
that
 
put
into
the
county
paper
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
regular
biography
,
besides
,
of
the
governess
's
father
,
so
as
to
stop
people
from
talking
 
a
great
flourish
about
his
pedigree
,
and
a
long
account
of
his
services
in
the
army
;
but
not
a
word
,
mind
ye
,
of
his
having
turned
wine
-
merchant
afterward
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
no
 
not
a
word
about
that
!
  
<EOS>
I
knew
it
,
though
,
for
Mr.
Frank
told
me
.
<EOS>
He
had
n't
a
bit
of
pride
about
him
.
<EOS>
He
introduced
me
to
his
future
wife
one
day
when
I
met
him
out
walking
,
and
asked
me
if
I
did
not
think
he
was
a
lucky
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
admitting
that
I
did
,
and
that
I
told
him
so
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
but
she
was
one
of
my
sort
,
was
that
governess
.
<EOS>
Stood
,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
,
five
foot
four
.
<EOS>
Good
lissom
figure
,
that
looked
as
if
it
had
never
been
boxed
up
in
a
pair
of
stays
.
<EOS>
Eyes
that
made
me
feel
as
if
I
was
under
a
pretty
stiff
cross
-
examination
the
moment
she
looked
at
me
.
<EOS>
Fine
red
,
kiss
-
and
-
come
-
again
sort
of
lips
.
<EOS>
Cheeks
and
complexion
 
<EOS>
No
,
Mr.
Artist
,
you
would
n't
identify
her
by
her
cheeks
and
complexion
,
if
I
drew
you
a
picture
of
them
this
very
moment
.
<EOS>
She
has
had
a
family
of
children
since
the
time
I
'm
talking
of
;
and
her
cheeks
are
a
trifle
fatter
,
and
her
complexion
is
a
shade
or
two
redder
now
,
than
when
I
first
met
her
out
walking
with
Mr.
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
to
take
place
on
a
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
I
decline
mentioning
the
year
or
the
month
.
<EOS>
I
had
started
as
<EOS>
an
attorney
on
my
own
account
 
say
six
weeks
,
more
or
less
,
and
was
sitting
alone
in
my
office
on
the
Monday
morning
before
the
wedding
-
day
,
trying
to
see
my
way
clear
before
me
and
not
succeeding
particularly
well
,
when
Mr.
Frank
suddenly
bursts
in
,
as
white
as
any
ghost
that
ever
was
painted
,
and
says
he
's
got
the
most
dreadful
case
for
me
to
advise
on
,
and
not
an
hour
to
lose
in
acting
on
my
advice
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
this
in
the
way
of
business
,
Mr.
Frank
?
"
says
I
,
stopping
him
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
get
sentimental
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
or
no
,
Mr.
Frank
?
<EOS>
"
rapping
my
new
office
paper
-
knife
on
the
table
,
to
pull
him
up
short
all
the
sooner
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
fellow
"
 
h
e
was
always
familiar
with
me
 
<EOS>
"
it
's
in
the
way
of
business
,
certainly
;
but
friendship
"
  
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
pull
him
up
short
again
,
and
regularly
examine
him
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
witness
-
box
,
or
he
would
have
kept
me
talking
to
no
purpose
half
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
Mr.
Frank
,
"
says
I
,
"
I
ca
n't
have
any
sentimentality
mixed
up
with
business
matters
.
<EOS>
You
please
to
stop
talking
,
and
let
me
ask
questions
.
<EOS>
Answer
in
the
fewest
words
you
can
use
.
<EOS>
Nod
when
nodding
will
do
instead
of
words
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
fixed
him
with
my
eye
for
about
three
seconds
,
as
he
sat
groaning
and
wriggling
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
When
I
'd
done
fixing
him
,
I
gave
another
rap
with
my
paper
-
knife
on
the
table
to
startle
him
up
a
bit
.
<EOS>
Then
I
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
"
From
what
you
have
been
stating
up
to
the
present
time
,
"
says
I
,
"
I
gather
that
you
are
in
a
scrape
which
is
likely
to
interfere
seriously
with
your
marriage
on
Wednesday
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
(
He
nodded
,
and
I
cut
in
again
before
he
could
say
a
word
)
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
scrape
affects
your
young
lady
,
and
goes
back
to
the
period
of
a
transaction
in
which
her
late
father
was
engaged
,
does
n't
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
(
He
nods
,
and
I
cut
in
once
more
)
:
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
party
,
who
turned
up
after
seeing
the
announcement
of
your
marriage
in
the
paper
,
who
is
cognizant
of
what
he
ought
n't
to
know
,
and
who
is
prepared
to
use
his
knowledge
of
the
same
to
the
prejudice
of
the
young
lady
and
of
your
marriage
,
unless
he
receives
a
sum
of
money
to
quiet
him
?
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Now
,
first
of
all
,
Mr.
Frank
,
state
what
you
have
been
told
by
the
young
lady
herself
about
the
transaction
of
her
late
father
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
first
come
to
have
any
knowledge
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
talking
to
me
about
her
father
one
day
so
tenderly
and
prettily
,
that
she
quite
excited
my
interest
about
him
,
"
begins
Mr.
Frank
;
"
and
I
asked
her
,
among
other
things
,
what
had
occasioned
his
death
.
<EOS>
She
said
she
believed
it
was
distress
of
mind
in
the
first
instance
;
and
added
that
this
distress
was
connected
with
a
shocking
secret
,
which
she
and
her
mother
had
kept
from
everybody
,
but
which
she
could
not
keep
from
me
,
because
she
was
determined
to
begin
her
married
life
by
having
no
secrets
from
her
husband
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
Mr.
Frank
began
to
get
sentimental
again
,
and
I
pulled
him
up
short
once
more
with
the
paper
-
knife
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
told
me
,
"
Mr.
Frank
went
on
,
"
that
the
great
mistake
of
her
father
's
life
was
his
selling
out
of
the
army
and
taking
to
the
wine
trade
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
talent
for
business
;
things
went
wrong
with
him
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
His
clerk
,
it
was
strongly
suspected
,
cheated
him
<EOS>
"
  
"
Stop
a
bit
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
What
was
that
suspected
clerk
's
name
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Davager
,
"
says
he
.
  
<EOS>
"
Davager
,
"
says
I
,
making
a
note
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
Go
on
,
Mr.
Frank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
affairs
got
more
and
more
entangled
,
"
says
Mr.
Frank
;
"
he
was
pressed
for
money
in
all
directions
;
bankruptcy
,
and
consequent
dishonor
(
as
he
considered
it
)
stared
him
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
His
mind
was
so
affected
by
his
troubles
that
both
his
wife
and
daughter
,
toward
the
last
,
considered
him
to
be
hardly
responsible
for
his
own
acts
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
desperation
and
misery
,
he
"
Here
Mr.
Frank
began
to
hesitate
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
two
ways
in
the
law
of
drawing
evidence
off
nice
and
clear
from
an
unwilling
client
or
witness
.
<EOS>
We
give
him
a
fright
,
or
we
treat
him
to
a
joke
.
<EOS>
I
treated
Mr.
Frank
to
a
joke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
"
says
I
,
"
I
know
what
he
did
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
signature
to
write
;
and
,
by
the
most
natural
mistake
in
the
world
,
he
wrote
another
gentleman
's
name
instead
of
his
own
 
eh
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
to
a
bill
,
"
says
Mr.
Frank
,
looking
very
crestfallen
,
instead
of
taking
the
joke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
principal
creditor
would
n't
wait
till
he
could
raise
the
money
,
or
the
greater
part
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
resolved
,
if
he
sold
off
everything
,
to
get
the
amount
and
repay
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
course
,
"
says
I
,
"
drop
that
.
<EOS>
The
forgery
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
When
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Before
even
the
first
attempt
was
made
to
negotiate
the
bill
.
<EOS>
He
had
done
the
whole
thing
in
the
most
absurdly
and
innocently
wrong
way
.
<EOS>
The
person
whose
name
he
had
used
was
a
stanch
friend
of
his
,
and
a
relation
of
his
wife
's
 
a
good
man
as
well
as
a
rich
one
.
<EOS>
He
had
influence
with
the
chief
creditor
,
and
he
used
it
nobly
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
real
affection
for
the
unfortunate
man
's
wife
,
and
he
proved
it
generously
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Come
to
the
point
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
What
did
he
do
?
<EOS>
In
a
business
way
,
what
did
he
do
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
put
the
false
bill
into
the
fire
,
drew
a
bill
of
his
own
to
replace
it
,
and
then
 
only
then
 
told
my
dear
girl
and
her
mother
all
that
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Can
you
imagine
anything
nobler
?
"
asks
Mr.
Frank

<EOS>
"
Speaking
in
my
professional
capacity
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
anything
greener
,
"
says
I.
"
<EOS>
Where
was
the
father
?
<EOS>
Off
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ill
in
bed
,
"
says
Mr.
Frank
,
coloring
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
mustered
strength
enough
to
write
a
contrite
and
grateful
letter
the
same
day
,
promising
to
prove
himself
worthy
of
the
noble
moderation
and
forgiveness
extended
to
him
,
by
selling
off
everything
he
possessed
to
repay
his
money
debt
.
<EOS>
He
did
sell
off
everything
,
down
to
some
old
family
pictures
that
were
heirlooms
;
down
to
the
little
plate
he
had
;
down
to
the
very
tables
and
chairs
that
furnished
his
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Every
farthing
of
the
debt
was
paid
;
and
he
was
left
to
begin
the
world
again
,
with
the
kindest
promises
of
help
from
the
generous
man
who
had
forgiven
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
His
crime
of
one
rash
moment
 
atoned
for
though
it
had
been
 
preyed
upon
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
became
possessed
with
the
idea
that
he
had
lowered
himself
forever
in
the
estimation
of
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
"
  
"
He
died
,
"
I
cut
in
.
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
we
know
that
.
<EOS>
Let
's
go
back
for
a
minute
to
the
contrite
and
grateful
letter
that
he
wrote
.
<EOS>
My
experience
in
the
law
,
Mr.
Frank
,
has
convinced
me
that
if
everybody
burned
everybody
else
's
letters
,
half
the
courts
of
justice
in
this
country
might
shut
up
shop
.
<EOS>
Do
you
happen
to
know
whether
the
letter
we
are
now
speaking
of
contained
anything
like
an
avowal
or
confession
of
the
forgery
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
it
did
,
"
says
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
the
writer
express
his
contrition
properly
without
making
some
such
confession
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Quite
easy
,
if
he
had
been
a
lawyer
,
"
says
I.
"
<EOS>
But
never
mind
that
;
I
'm
going
to
make
a
guess
 
<EOS>
a
desperate
guess
,
mind
.
<EOS>
Should
I
be
altogether
in
error
if
I
thought
that
this
letter
had
been
stolen
;
and
that
the
fingers
of
Mr.
Davager
,
of
suspicious
commercial
celebrity
,
might
possibly
be
the
fingers
which
took
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
exactly
what
I
wanted
to
make
you
understand
,
"
cried
Mr.
Frank
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
did
he
communicate
the
interesting
fact
of
the
theft
to
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
not
ventured
into
my
presence
.
<EOS>
The
scoundrel
actually
had
the
audacity
"
  
"
<EOS>
Aha
!
"
says
I.
"
The
young
lady
herself
!
<EOS>
Sharp
practitioner
,
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Early
this
morning
,
when
she
was
walking
alone
in
the
shrubbery
,
"
Mr.
Frank
goes
on
,
"
he
had
the
assurance
to
approach
her
,
and
to
say
that
he
had
been
watching
his
opportunity
of
getting
a
private
interview
for
days
past
.
<EOS>
He
then
showed
her
 
actually
showed
her
 
<EOS>
her
unfortunate
father
's
letter
;
put
into
her
hands
another
letter
directed
to
me
;
bowed
,
and
walked
off
;
leaving
her
half
dead
with
astonishment
and
terror
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
only
happened
to
be
there
at
the
time
!
"
says
Mr.
Frank
,
shaking
his
fist
murderously
in
the
air
,
by
way
of
a
finish
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
greatest
luck
in
the
world
that
you
were
not
,
"
says
I.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
got
that
other
letter
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
handed
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
remarkably
humorous
and
short
,
that
I
remember
every
word
of
it
at
this
distance
of
time
.
<EOS>
It
began
in
this
way
:
  
"
To
Francis
Gatliffe
,
Esq

,
Jun.
 
<EOS>
"
SIR
 
<EOS>
I
have
an
extremely
curious
autograph
letter
to
sell
.
<EOS>
The
price
is
a
five
-
hundred
-
pound
note
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
to
whom
you
are
to
be
married
on
Wednesday
will
inform
you
of
the
nature
of
the
letter
,
and
the
genuineness
of
the
autograph
.
<EOS>
If
you
refuse
to
deal
,
I
shall
send
a
copy
to
the
local
paper
,
and
shall
wait
on
your
highly
-
respected
father
with
the
original
curiosity
,
on
the
afternoon
of
Tuesday
next
.
<EOS>
Having
come
down
here
on
family
business
,
I
have
put
up
at
the
family
hotel
 
being
to
be
heard
of
at
the
Gatliffe
Arms
.
<EOS>
Your
very
obedient
servant
,
ALFRED
DAVAGER
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
clever
fellow
that
,
"
says
I
,
putting
the
letter
into
my
private
drawer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Clever
!
"
cries
Mr.
Frank
,
"
he
ought
to
be
horsewhipped
within
an
inch
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
would
have
done
it
myself
;
but
she
made
me
promise
,
before
she
told
me
a
word
of
the
matter
,
to
come
straight
to
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
was
one
of
the
wisest
promises
you
ever
made
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
We
ca
n't
afford
to
bully
this
fellow
,
whatever
else
we
may
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
am
saying
anything
libelous
against
your
excellent
father
's
character
when
I
assert
that
if
he
saw
the
letter
he
would
certainly
insist
on
your
marriage
being
put
off
,
at
the
very
least
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Feeling
as
my
father
does
about
my
marriage
,
he
would
insist
on
its
being
dropped
altogether
,
if
he
saw
this
letter
,
"
says
Mr.
Frank
,
with
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"
But
even
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
generous
,
noble
girl
herself
says
that
if
the
letter
appears
in
the
paper
,
with
all
the
unanswerable
comments
this
scoundrel
would
be
sure
to
add
to
it
,
she
would
rather
die
than
hold
me
to
my
engagement
,
even
if
my
father
would
let
me
keep
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
his
eyes
began
to
water
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
weak
young
fellow
,
and
ridiculously
fond
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
brought
him
back
to
business
with
another
rap
of
the
paper
-
knife
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
up
,
Mr.
Frank
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
question
or
two
more
.
<EOS>
Did
you
think
of
asking
the
young
lady
whether
,
to
the
best
of
her
knowledge
,
this
infernal
letter
was
the
only
written
evidence
of
the
forgery
now
in
existence
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
did
think
directly
of
asking
her
that
,
"
says
he
;
"
and
she
told
me
she
was
quite
certain
that
there
was
no
written
evidence
of
the
forgery
except
that
one
letter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
give
Mr.
Davager
his
price
for
it
?
"
says
I.
  
"
Yes
,
"
says
Mr.
Frank
,
quite
peevish
with
me
for
asking
him
such
a
question
.
<EOS>
He
was
an
easy
young
chap
in
money
matters
,
and
talked
of
hundreds
as
most
men
talk
of
sixpences
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mr.
Frank
,
"
says
I
,
"
you
came
here
to
get
my
help
and
advice
in
this
extremely
ticklish
business
,
and
you
are
ready
,
as
I
know
without
asking
,
to
remunerate
me
for
all
and
any
of
my
services
at
the
usual
professional
rate
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
act
boldly
 
desperately
,
if
you
like
 
on
the
hit
or
miss
,
win
all
or
lose
all
principle
 
in
dealing
with
this
matter
.
<EOS>
Here
is
my
proposal
.
<EOS>
I
'm
going
to
try
if
I
ca
n't
do
Mr.
Davager
out
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
n't
succeed
before
to
-
morrow
afternoon
,
you
hand
him
the
money
,
and
I
charge
you
nothing
for
professional
services
.
<EOS>
If
I
do
succeed
,
I
hand
you
the
letter
instead
of
Mr.
Davager
,
and
you
give
me
the
money
instead
of
giving
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
's
a
precious
risk
for
me
,
but
I
'm
ready
to
run
it
.
<EOS>
You
must
pay
your
five
hundred
any
way
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
my
plan
?
<EOS>
Is
it
<EOS>
Yes
,
Mr.
Frank
,
or
No
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hang
your
questions
!
"
<EOS>
cries
Mr.
Frank
,
jumping
up
;
<EOS>
"
you
know
it
's
Yes
ten
thousand
times
over
.
<EOS>
Only
you
earn
the
money
and
"
  
"
And
you
will
be
too
glad
to
give
it
to
me
.
<EOS>
Very
good
.
<EOS>
Now
go
home
.
<EOS>
Comfort
the
young
lady
 
<EOS>
do
n't
let
Mr.
Davager
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
you
 
<EOS>
keep
quiet
 
leave
everything
to
me
 
and
feel
as
certain
as
you
please
that
all
the
letters
in
the
world
ca
n't
stop
your
being
married
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
I
hustled
him
off
out
of
the
office
,
for
I
wanted
to
be
left
alone
to
make
my
mind
up
about
what
I
should
do
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
,
of
course
,
was
to
have
a
look
at
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
Mr.
Davager
,
telling
him
that
I
was
privately
appointed
to
arrange
the
little
business
matter
between
himself
and
"
another
party
"
(
no
names
!
)
<EOS>
on
friendly
terms
;
and
begging
him
to
call
on
me
at
his
earliest
convenience
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
,
Mr.
Davager
bothered
me
.
<EOS>
His
answer
was
,
that
it
would
not
be
convenient
to
him
to
call
till
between
six
and
seven
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
you
see
,
he
contrived
to
make
me
lose
several
precious
hours
,
at
a
time
when
minutes
almost
were
of
importance
.
<EOS>
I
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
be
patient
,
and
to
give
certain
instructions
,
before
Mr.
Davager
came
,
to
my
boy
Tom
.
  
<EOS>
There
never
was
such
a
sharp
boy
of
fourteen
before
,
and
there
never
will
be
again
,
as
my
boy
Tom
.
<EOS>
A
spy
to
look
after
Mr.
Davager
was
,
of
course
,
the
first
requisite
in
a
case
of
this
kind
;
and
<EOS>
Tom
was
the
smallest
,
quickest
,
quietest
,
sharpest
,
stealthiest
little
snake
of
a
chap
that
ever
dogged
a
gentleman
's
steps
and
kept
cleverly
out
of
range
of
a
gentleman
's
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
settled
it
with
the
boy
that
he
was
not
to
show
at
all
when
Mr.
Davager
came
;
and
that
he
was
to
wait
to
hear
me
ring
the
bell
when
Mr.
Davager
left
.
<EOS>
If
I
rang
twice
,
he
was
to
show
the
gentleman
out
.
<EOS>
If
I
rang
once
,
he
was
to
keep
out
of
the
way
,
and
follow
the
gentleman
whereever
he
went
till
he
got
back
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Those
were
the
only
preparations
I
could
make
to
begin
with
;
being
obliged
to
wait
,
and
let
myself
be
guided
by
what
turned
up
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
quarter
to
seven
my
gentleman
came
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
profession
of
the
law
we
get
somehow
quite
remarkably
mixed
up
with
ugly
people
,
blackguard
people
,
and
dirty
people
.
<EOS>
But
far
away
the
ugliest
and
dirtiest
blackguard
I
ever
saw
in
my
life
was
Mr.
Alfred
Davager
.
<EOS>
He
had
greasy
white
hair
and
a
mottled
face
.
<EOS>
He
was
low
in
the
forehead
,
fat
in
the
stomach
,
hoarse
in
the
voice
,
and
weak
in
the
legs
.
<EOS>
Both
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
,
and
one
was
fixed
in
his
head
.
<EOS>
He
smelled
of
spirits
,
and
carried
a
toothpick
in
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
?
<EOS>
I
've
just
done
dinner
,
"
says
he
;
and
he
lights
a
cigar
,
sits
down
with
his
legs
crossed
,
and
winks
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
at
first
to
take
the
measure
of
him
in
a
wheedling
,
confidential
way
;
but
it
was
no
good
.
<EOS>
I
asked
him
,
in
a
facetious
,
smiling
manner
,
how
he
had
got
hold
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
only
told
me
in
answer
that
he
had
been
in
the
confidential
employment
of
the
writer
of
it
,
and
that
he
had
always
been
famous
since
infancy
for
a
sharp
eye
to
his
own
interests
.
<EOS>
I
paid
him
some
compliments
;
but
he
was
not
to
be
flattered
.
<EOS>
I
tried
to
make
him
lose
his
temper
;
but
he
kept
it
in
spite
of
me
.
<EOS>
It
ended
in
his
driving
me
to
my
last
resource
 
<EOS>
I
made
an
attempt
to
frighten
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Before
we
say
a
word
about
the
money
,
"
I
began
,
"
let
me
put
a
case
,
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
The
pull
you
have
on
Mr.
Francis
Gatliffe
is
,
that
you
can
hinder
his
marriage
on
Wednesday
.
<EOS>
Now
,
suppose
I
have
got
a
magistrate
's
warrant
to
apprehend
you
in
my
pocket
?
<EOS>
Suppose
I
have
a
constable
to
execute
it
in
the
next
room
?
<EOS>
Suppose
I
bring
you
up
to
-
morrow
 
<EOS>
the
day
before
the
marriage
 
charge
you
only
generally
with
an
attempt
to
extort
money
,
and
apply
for
a
day
's
remand
to
complete
the
case
?
<EOS>
Suppose
,
as
a
suspicious
stranger
,
you
ca
n't
get
bail
in
this
town
?
<EOS>
Suppose
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
bit
,
"
says
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
should
not
be
the
greenest
fool
that
ever
stood
in
shoes
?
<EOS>
Suppose
I
should
not
carry
the
letter
about
me
?
<EOS>
Suppose
I
should
have
given
a
certain
envelope
to
a
certain
friend
of
mine
in
a
certain
place
in
this
town
?
<EOS>
Suppose
the
letter
should
be
inside
that
envelope
,
directed
to
old
Gatliffe
,
side
by
side
with
a
copy
of
the
letter
directed
to
the
editor
of
the
local
paper
?
<EOS>
Suppose
my
friend
should
be
instructed
to
open
the
envelope
,
and
take
the
letters
to
their
right
address
,
if
I
do
n't
appear
to
claim
them
from
him
this
evening
?
<EOS>
In
short
,
my
dear
sir
,
suppose
you
were
born
yesterday
,
and
suppose
I
was
n't
?
"
says
Mr.
Davager
,
and
winks
at
me
again
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
n't
take
me
by
surprise
,
for
I
never
expected
that
he
had
the
letter
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
made
a
pretense
of
being
very
much
taken
aback
,
and
of
being
quite
ready
to
give
in
.
<EOS>
We
settled
our
business
about
delivering
the
letter
,
and
handing
over
the
money
,
in
no
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
to
draw
out
a
document
,
which
he
was
to
sign
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
document
was
stuff
and
nonsense
,
just
as
well
as
I
did
,
and
told
me
I
was
only
proposing
it
to
swell
my
client
's
bill
.
<EOS>
Sharp
as
he
was
,
he
was
wrong
there
.
<EOS>
The
document
was
not
to
be
drawn
out
to
gain
money
from
Mr.
Frank
,
but
to
gain
time
from
Mr.
Davager
.
<EOS>
It
served
me
as
an
excuse
to
put
off
the
payment
of
the
five
hundred
pounds
till
three
o'clock
on
the
Tuesday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
Tuesday
morning
Mr.
Davager
said
he
should
devote
to
his
amusement
,
and
asked
me
what
sights
were
to
be
seen
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
told
him
,
he
pitched
his
toothpick
into
my
grate
,
yawned
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
I
rang
the
bell
once
 
waited
till
he
had
passed
the
window
 
and
then
looked
after
Tom
.
<EOS>
There
was
my
jewel
of
a
boy
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
,
just
setting
his
top
going
in
the
most
playful
manner
possible
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
walked
away
up
the
street
toward
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
Tom
whipped
his
top
up
the
street
toward
the
market
-
place
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
came
back
,
with
all
his
evidence
collected
in
a
beautifully
clear
and
compact
state
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
had
walked
to
a
public
-
house
just
outside
the
town
,
in
a
lane
leading
to
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
On
a
bench
outside
the
public
-
house
there
sat
a
man
smoking
.
<EOS>
He
said
"
All
right
?
"
and
gave
a
letter
to
Mr.
Davager
,
who
answered
"
All
right
!
"
and
walked
back
to
the
inn
.
<EOS>
In
the
hall
he
ordered
hot
rum
-
and
-
water
,
cigars
,
slippers
,
and
a
fire
to
be
lit
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
After
that
he
went
upstairs
,
and
Tom
came
away
.
  
<EOS>
I
now
saw
my
road
clear
before
me
 
not
very
far
on
,
but
still
clear
.
<EOS>
I
had
housed
the
letter
,
in
all
probability
for
that
night
,
at
the
Gatliffe
Arms
.
<EOS>
After
tipping
Tom
,
I
gave
him
directions
to
play
about
the
door
of
the
inn
,
and
refresh
himself
when
he
was
tired
at
the
tart
-
shop
opposite
,
eating
as
much
as
he
pleased
,
on
the
understanding
that
he
crammed
all
the
time
with
his
eye
on
the
window
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Davager
went
out
,
or
Mr.
Davager
's
friend
called
on
him
,
Tom
was
to
let
me
know
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
to
take
a
little
note
from
me
to
the
head
chambermaid
 
an
old
friend
of
mine
 
asking
her
to
step
over
to
my
office
,
on
a
private
matter
of
business
,
as
soon
as
her
work
was
done
for
that
night
.
<EOS>
After
settling
these
little
matters
,
having
half
an
hour
to
spare
,
I
turned
to
and
did
myself
a
bloater
at
the
office
fire
,
and
had
a
drop
of
gin
-
and
-
water
hot
,
and
felt
comparatively
happy
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
head
chambermaid
came
,
it
turned
out
,
as
good
luck
would
have
it
,
that
Mr.
Davager
had
drawn
her
attention
rather
too
closely
to
his
ugliness
,
by
offering
her
a
testimony
of
his
regard
in
the
shape
of
a
kiss
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
mentioned
him
than
she
flew
into
a
passion
;
and
when
I
added
,
by
way
of
clinching
the
matter
,
that
I
was
retained
to
defend
the
interests
of
a
very
beautiful
and
deserving
young
lady
(
name
not
referred
to
,
of
course
)
against
the
most
cruel
underhand
treachery
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Davager
,
the
head
chambermaid
was
ready
to
go
any
lengths
that
she
could
safely
to
serve
my
cause
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
words
I
discovered
that
Boots
was
to
call
Mr.
Davager
at
eight
the
next
morning
,
and
was
to
take
his
clothes
downstairs
to
brush
as
usual
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
D
 
had
not
emptied
his
own
pockets
overnight
,
we
arranged
that
Boots
was
to
forget
to
empty
them
for
him
,
and
was
to
bring
the
clothes
downstairs
just
as
he
found
them
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
D
#
#
#
#
's
pockets
were
emptied
,
then
,
of
course
,
it
would
be
necessary
to
transfer
the
searching
process
to
Mr.
D
#
#
#
#
's
room
.
<EOS>
Under
any
circumstances
,
I
was
certain
of
the
head
chambermaid
;
and
under
any
circumstances
,
also
,
the
head
chambermaid
was
certain
of
Boots
.
  
<EOS>
I
waited
till
Tom
came
home
,
looking
very
puffy
and
bilious
about
the
face
;
but
<EOS>
as
to
his
intellects
,
if
anything
,
rather
sharper
than
ever
.
<EOS>
His
report
was
uncommonly
short
and
pleasant
.
<EOS>
The
inn
was
shutting
up
;
Mr.
Davager
was
going
to
bed
in
rather
a
drunken
condition
;
Mr.
Davager
's
friend
had
never
appeared
.
<EOS>
I
sent
Tom
(
properly
instructed
about
keeping
our
man
in
view
all
the
next
morning
)
to
his
shake
-
down
behind
the
office
-
desk
,
where
I
heard
him
hiccoughing
half
the
night
,
as
even
the
best
boys
will
,
when
over
-
excited
and
too
full
of
tarts
.
  
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
seven
next
morning
,
I
slipped
quietly
into
Boots
's
pantry
.
  
<EOS>
Down
came
the
clothes
.
<EOS>
No
pockets
in
trousers
.
<EOS>
Waistcoat
-
pockets
empty
.
<EOS>
Coat
-
pockets
with
something
in
them
.
<EOS>
First
,
handkerchief
;
secondly
,
bunch
of
keys
;
thirdly
,
cigar
-
case
;
fourthly
,
pocketbook
.
<EOS>
Of
course
I
was
n't
such
a
fool
as
to
expect
to
find
the
letter
there
,
but
I
opened
the
pocketbook
with
a
certain
curiosity
,
notwithstanding
.
  
<EOS>
Nothing
in
the
two
pockets
of
the
book
but
some
old
advertisements
cut
out
of
newspapers
,
a
lock
of
hair
tied
round
with
a
dirty
bit
of
ribbon
,
a
circular
letter
about
a
loan
society
,
and
some
copies
of
verses
not
likely
to
suit
any
company
that
was
not
of
an
extremely
free
-
and
-
easy
description
.
<EOS>
On
the
leaves
of
the
pocketbook
,
people
's
addresses
scrawled
in
pencil
,
and
bets
jotted
down
in
red
ink
.
<EOS>
On
one
leaf
,
by
itself
,
this
queer
inscription
:
  
"
MEM
.
5
ALONG
.
<EOS>
4
ACROSS
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
understood
everything
but
those
words
and
figures
,
so
of
course
I
copied
them
out
into
my
own
book
.
  
<EOS>
Then
I
waited
in
the
pantry
till
Boots
had
brushed
the
clothes
,
and
had
taken
them
upstairs
.
<EOS>
His
report
when
he
came
down
was
,
that
Mr.
D
 
had
asked
if
it
was
a
fine
morning
.
<EOS>
Being
told
that
it
was
,
he
had
ordered
breakfast
at
nine
,
and
a
saddle
-
horse
to
be
at
the
door
at
ten
,
to
take
him
to
Grimwith
Abbey
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
sights
in
our
neighborhood
which
I
had
told
him
of
the
evening
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
'll
be
here
,
coming
in
by
the
back
way
,
at
half
-
past
ten
,
"
says
I
to
the
head
chambermaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
for
?
"
says
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
take
the
responsibility
of
making
Mr.
Davager
's
bed
off
your
hands
for
this
morning
only
,
"
says
I.
  
"
Any
more
orders
?
"
says
she
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
more
,
"
says
I.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
hire
Sam
for
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Put
it
down
in
the
order
-
book
that
he
's
to
be
brought
round
to
my
office
at
ten
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
case
you
should
think
Sam
was
a
man
,
I
'd
better
perhaps
tell
you
he
was
a
pony
.
<EOS>
I
'd
made
up
my
mind
that
it
would
be
beneficial
to
Tom
's
health
,
after
the
 
tarts
,
if
he
took
a
constitutional
airing
on
a
nice
hard
saddle
in
the
direction
of
Grimwith
Abbey
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
else
?
"
says
the
head
chambermaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
one
more
favor
,
"
says
I.
"
<EOS>
Would
my
boy
Tom
be
very
much
in
the
way
if
he
came
,
from
now
till
ten
,
to
help
with
the
boots
and
shoes
,
and
stood
at
his
work
close
by
this
window
which
looks
out
on
the
staircase
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
a
bit
,
"
says
the
head
chambermaid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
says
I
;
and
stepped
back
to
my
office
directly
.
  
<EOS>
When
I
had
sent
Tom
off
to
help
with
the
boots
and
shoes
,
I
reviewed
the
whole
case
exactly
as
it
stood
at
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
three
things
Mr.
Davager
might
do
with
the
letter
.
<EOS>
He
might
give
it
to
his
friend
again
before
ten
 
in
which
case
Tom
would
most
likely
see
the
said
friend
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
might
take
it
to
his
friend
,
or
to
some
other
friend
,
after
ten
 
in
which
case
Tom
was
ready
to
follow
him
on
Sam
the
pony
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
he
might
leave
it
hidden
somewhere
in
his
room
at
the
inn
 
in
which
case
I
was
all
ready
for
him
with
a
search
-
warrant
of
my
own
granting
,
under
favor
always
of
my
friend
the
head
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
So
far
I
had
my
business
arrangements
all
gathered
up
nice
and
compact
in
my
own
hands
.
<EOS>
Only
two
things
bothered
me
;
the
terrible
shortness
of
the
time
at
my
disposal
,
in
case
I
failed
in
my
first
experiments
,
for
getting
hold
of
the
letter
,
and
that
queer
inscription
which
I
had
copied
out
of
the
pocketbook
:
  
"
MEM
.
5
ALONG
.
<EOS>
4
ACROSS
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
measurement
most
likely
of
something
,
and
he
was
afraid
of
forgetting
it
;
therefore
it
was
something
important
.
<EOS>
Query
 
something
about
himself
?
<EOS>
Say
"
5
"
(
inches
)
"
along
"
 
h
e
does
n't
wear
a
wig
.
<EOS>
Say
"
5
"
(
feet
)
"
along
"
 
i
t
ca
n't
be
coat
,
waistcoat
,
trousers
,
or
underclothing
.
<EOS>
Say
"
5
"
(
yards
)
"
along
"
 
i
t
ca
n't
be
anything
about
himself
,
unless
he
wears
round
his
body
the
rope
that
he
's
sure
to
be
hanged
with
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
Then
it
is
not
something
about
himself
.
<EOS>
What
do
I
know
of
that
is
important
to
him
besides
?
<EOS>
I
know
of
nothing
but
the
Letter
.
<EOS>
Can
the
memorandum
be
connected
with
that
?
<EOS>
Say
,
yes
.
<EOS>
What
do
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
mean
,
then
?
<EOS>
The
measurement
of
something
he
carries
about
with
him
?
<EOS>
or
the
measurement
of
something
in
his
room
?
<EOS>
I
could
get
pretty
satisfactorily
to
myself
as
far
as
that
;
but
I
could
get
no
further
.
  
<EOS>
Tom
came
back
to
the
office
,
and
reported
him
mounted
for
his
ride
.
<EOS>
His
friend
had
never
appeared
.
<EOS>
I
sent
the
boy
off
,
with
his
proper
instructions
,
on
Sam
's
back
 
wrote
an
encouraging
letter
to
Mr.
Frank
to
keep
him
quiet
 
then
slipped
into
the
inn
by
the
back
way
a
little
before
half
-
past
ten
.
<EOS>
The
head
chambermaid
gave
me
a
signal
when
the
landing
was
clear
.
<EOS>
I
got
into
his
room
without
a
soul
<EOS>
but
her
seeing
me
,
and
locked
the
door
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
The
case
was
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
simplified
now
.
<EOS>
Either
Mr.
Davager
had
ridden
out
with
the
letter
about
him
,
or
he
had
left
it
in
some
safe
hiding
-
place
in
his
room
.
<EOS>
I
suspected
it
to
be
in
his
room
,
for
a
reason
that
will
a
little
astonish
you
 
his
trunk
,
<EOS>
his
dressing
-
case
,
and
all
the
drawers
and
cupboards
,
were
left
open
.
<EOS>
I
knew
my
customer
,
and
I
thought
this
extraordinary
carelessness
on
his
part
rather
suspicious
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
had
taken
one
of
the
best
bedrooms
at
the
Gatliffe
Arms
.
<EOS>
Floor
carpeted
all
over
,
walls
beautifully
papered
,
four
-
poster
,
and
general
furniture
first
-
rate
.
<EOS>
I
searched
,
to
begin
with
,
on
the
usual
plan
,
examining
everything
in
every
possible
way
,
and
taking
more
than
an
hour
about
it
.
<EOS>
No
discovery
.
<EOS>
Then
I
pulled
out
a
carpenter
's
rule
which
I
had
brought
with
me
.
<EOS>
Was
there
anything
in
the
room
which
 
either
in
inches
,
feet
,
or
yards
 
answered
to
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
?
<EOS>
Nothing
.
<EOS>
I
put
the
rule
back
in
my
pocket
 
<EOS>
measurement
was
no
good
,
evidently
.
<EOS>
Was
there
anything
in
the
room
that
would
count
up
to
5
one
way
and
4
another
,
seeing
that
nothing
would
measure
up
to
it
?
<EOS>
I
had
got
obstinately
persuaded
by
this
time
that
the
letter
must
be
in
the
room
 
principally
because
of
the
trouble
I
had
had
in
looking
after
it
.
<EOS>
And
persuading
myself
of
that
,
I
took
it
into
my
head
next
,
just
as
obstinately
,
that
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
must
be
the
right
clew
to
find
the
letter
by
 
principally
because
I
had
n't
left
myself
,
after
all
my
searching
and
thinking
,
even
so
much
as
the
ghost
of
another
guide
to
go
by
.
<EOS>
"
Five
along
"
 
w
here
<EOS>
could
I
count
five
along
the
room
,
in
any
part
of
it
?
  
<EOS>
Not
on
the
paper
.
<EOS>
The
pattern
there
was
pillars
of
trellis
-
work
and
flowers
,
inclosing
a
plain
green
ground
 
only
four
pillars
along
the
wall
and
only
two
across
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
?
<EOS>
There
were
not
five
chairs
or
five
separate
pieces
of
any
furniture
in
the
room
altogether
.
<EOS>
The
fringes
that
hung
from
the
cornice
of
the
bed
?
<EOS>
Plenty
of
them
,
at
any
rate
!
<EOS>
Up
I
jumped
on
the
counterpane
,
with
my
pen
-
knife
in
my
hand
.
<EOS>
Every
way
that
"
5
along
"
and
"
4
across
"
could
be
reckoned
on
those
unlucky
fringes
I
reckoned
on
them
 
probed
with
my
penknife
 
scratched
with
my
nails
 
crunched
with
my
fingers
.
<EOS>
No
use
;
not
a
sign
of
a
letter
;
and
the
time
was
getting
on
 
<EOS>
oh
,
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
the
time
did
get
on
in
Mr.
Davager
's
room
that
morning
.
  
<EOS>
I
jumped
down
from
the
bed
,
so
desperate
at
my
ill
luck
that
I
hardly
cared
whether
anybody
heard
me
or
not
.
<EOS>
Quite
a
little
cloud
of
dust
rose
at
my
feet
as
they
thumped
on
the
carpet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hullo
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
"
my
friend
the
head
chambermaid
takes
it
easy
here
.
<EOS>
Nice
state
for
a
carpet
to
be
in
,
in
one
of
the
best
bedrooms
at
the
Gatliffe
Arms
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Carpet
!
<EOS>
I
had
been
jumping
up
on
the
bed
,
and
staring
up
at
the
walls
,
but
I
had
never
so
much
as
given
a
glance
down
at
the
carpet
.
<EOS>
Think
of
me
pretending
to
be
a
lawyer
,
and
not
knowing
how
to
look
low
enough
!
  
<EOS>
The
carpet
!
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
stout
article
in
its
time
,
had
evidently
began
in
a
drawing
-
room
;
then
descended
to
a
coffee
-
room
;
then
gone
upstairs
altogether
to
a
bedroom
.
<EOS>
The
ground
was
brown
,
and
the
pattern
was
bunches
of
leaves
and
roses
speckled
over
the
ground
at
regular
distances
.
<EOS>
I
reckoned
up
the
bunches
.
<EOS>
Ten
along
the
room
 
eight
across
it
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
stepped
out
five
one
way
and
four
the
other
,
and
was
down
on
my
knees
on
the
center
bunch
,
as
true
as
I
sit
on
this
chair
<EOS>
I
could
hear
my
own
heart
beating
so
loud
that
it
quite
frightened
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
looked
narrowly
all
over
the
bunch
,
and
I
felt
all
over
it
with
the
ends
of
my
fingers
,
and
nothing
came
of
that
.
<EOS>
Then
I
scraped
it
over
slowly
and
gently
with
my
nails
.
<EOS>
My
second
finger
-
nail
stuck
a
little
at
one
place
.
<EOS>
I
parted
the
pile
of
the
carpet
over
that
place
,
and
saw
a
thin
slit
which
had
been
hidden
by
the
pile
being
smoothed
over
it
 
a
slit
about
half
an
inch
long
,
with
a
little
end
of
brown
thread
,
exactly
the
color
of
the
carpet
ground
,
sticking
out
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
from
the
middle
of
it
.
<EOS>
Just
as
I
laid
hold
of
the
thread
gently
,
I
heard
a
footstep
outside
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
head
chambermaid
.
<EOS>
"
Have
n't
you
done
yet
?
<EOS>
"
she
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
two
minutes
,
"
says
I
,
"
and
do
n't
let
anybody
come
near
the
door
 
whatever
you
do
,
do
n't
let
anybody
startle
me
again
by
coming
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
took
a
little
pull
at
the
thread
,
and
heard
something
rustle
.
<EOS>
I
took
a
longer
pull
,
and
out
came
a
piece
of
paper
,
rolled
up
tight
like
those
candle
-
lighters
that
the
ladies
make
.
<EOS>
I
unrolled
it
 
and
,
by
George
!
<EOS>
there
was
the
letter
!
  
<EOS>
The
original
letter
!
<EOS>
I
knew
it
by
the
color
of
the
ink
.
<EOS>
The
letter
that
was
worth
five
hundred
pounds
to
me
!
<EOS>
It
was
all
that
I
could
do
to
keep
myself
at
first
from
throwing
my
hat
into
the
air
,
and
hurrahing
like
mad
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
take
a
chair
and
sit
quiet
in
it
for
a
minute
or
two
,
before
I
could
cool
myself
down
to
my
proper
business
level
.
<EOS>
I
knew
that
I
was
safely
down
again
when
I
found
myself
pondering
how
to
let
Mr.
Davager
know
that
he
had
been
done
by
the
innocent
country
attorney
,
after
all
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
a
nice
little
irritating
plan
occurred
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
tore
a
blank
leaf
out
of
my
pocketbook
,
wrote
on
it
with
my
pencil
,
"
Change
for
a
five
-
hundred
-
pound
note
,
"
folded
up
the
paper
,
tied
the
thread
to
it
,
poked
it
back
into
the
hiding
-
place
,
smoothed
over
the
pile
of
the
carpet
,
and
then
bolted
off
to
Mr.
Frank
.
<EOS>
He
in
his
turn
bolted
off
to
show
the
letter
to
the
young
lady
,
who
first
certified
to
its
genuineness
,
then
dropped
it
into
the
fire
,
and
then
took
the
initiative
for
the
first
time
since
her
marriage
engagement
,
by
flinging
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
kissing
him
with
all
her
might
,
and
going
into
hysterics
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
Mr.
Frank
told
me
,
but
that
's
not
evidence
.
<EOS>
It
is
evidence
,
however
,
that
I
saw
them
married
with
my
own
eyes
on
the
Wednesday
;
and
that
while
they
went
off
in
a
carriage
-
and
-
four
to
spend
the
honeymoon
,
I
went
off
on
my
own
legs
to
open
a
credit
at
the
Town
and
County
Bank
with
a
five
-
hundred
-
pound
note
in
my
pocket
.
  
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Davager
,
I
can
tell
you
nothing
more
about
him
,
except
what
is
derived
from
hearsay
evidence
,
which
is
always
unsatisfactory
evidence
,
even
in
a
lawyer
's
mouth
.
  
<EOS>
My
inestimable
boy
,
Tom
,
although
twice
kicked
off
by
Sam
the
pony
,
never
lost
hold
of
the
bridle
,
and
kept
his
man
in
sight
from
first
to
last
.
<EOS>
He
had
nothing
particular
to
report
except
that
on
the
way
out
to
the
Abbey
Mr.
Davager
had
stopped
at
the
public
-
house
,
had
spoken
a
word
or
two
to
his
friend
of
the
night
before
,
and
had
handed
him
what
looked
like
a
bit
of
paper
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
doubt
a
clew
to
the
thread
that
held
the
letter
,
to
be
used
in
case
of
accidents
.
<EOS>
In
every
other
respect
Mr.
D.
had
ridden
out
and
ridden
in
like
an
ordinary
sightseer
.
<EOS>
Tom
reported
him
to
me
as
having
dismounted
at
the
hotel
about
two
.
<EOS>
At
half
-
past
I
locked
my
office
door
,
nailed
a
card
under
the
knocker
with
"
not
at
home
till
to
-
morrow
"
written
on
it
,
and
retired
to
a
friend
's
house
a
mile
or
so
out
of
the
town
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Davager
,
I
have
been
since
given
to
understand
,
left
the
Gatliffe
Arms
that
same
night
with
his
best
clothes
on
his
back
,
and
with
all
the
valuable
contents
of
his
dressing
-
case
in
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
in
a
condition
to
state
whether
he
ever
went
through
the
form
of
asking
for
his
bill
or
not
;
but
I
can
positively
testify
that
he
never
paid
it
,
and
that
the
effects
left
in
his
bedroom
did
not
pay
it
either
.
<EOS>
When
I
add
to
these
fragments
of
evidence
that
he
and
I
have
never
met
(
luckily
for
me
,
you
will
say
)
since
I
jockeyed
him
out
of
his
banknote
,
I
have
about
fulfilled
my
implied
contract
as
maker
of
a
statement
with
you
,
sir
,
as
hearer
of
a
statement
.
<EOS>
Observe
the
expression
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
I
said
it
was
a
Statement
before
I
began
;
and
I
say
it
's
a
Statement
<EOS>
now
I
've
done
.
<EOS>
I
defy
you
to
prove
it
's
a
Story
!
<EOS>
How
are
you
getting
on
with
my
portrait
?
<EOS>
I
like
you
very
well
,
Mr.
Artist
;
but
if
you
have
been
taking
advantage
of
my
talking
to
shirk
your
work
,
as
sure
as
you
're
alive
<EOS>
I
'll
split
upon
you
to
the
Town
Council
!
  
<EOS>
I
attended
a
great
many
times
at
my
queer
sitter
's
house
before
his
likeness
was
completed
.
<EOS>
To
the
last
he
was
dissatisfied
with
the
progress
I
made
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
me
,
the
Town
Council
approved
of
the
portrait
when
it
was
done
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Boxsious
,
however
,
objected
to
them
as
being
much
too
easy
to
please
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
dispute
the
fidelity
of
the
likeness
,
but
he
asserted
that
I
had
not
covered
the
canvas
with
half
paint
enough
for
my
money
.
<EOS>
To
this
day
(
for
he
is
still
alive
)
,
he
describes
me
to
all
inquiring
friends
as
"
The
Painter
-
Man
who
jockeyed
the
Town
Council
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
PROLOGUE
TO
THE
THIRD
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
day
for
me
when
Mr.
Lanfray
,
of
Rockleigh
Place
,
discovering
that
his
youngest
daughter
's
health
required
a
warm
climate
,
removed
from
his
English
establishment
to
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
Roving
from
place
to
place
,
as
I
am
obliged
to
do
,
though
I
make
many
acquaintances
,
I
keep
but
few
friends
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
my
calling
is
,
I
am
quite
aware
,
mainly
answerable
for
this
.
<EOS>
People
can
not
be
blamed
for
forgetting
a
man
who
,
on
leaving
their
houses
,
never
can
tell
them
for
certain
when
he
is
likely
to
be
in
their
neighborhood
again
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Lanfray
was
one
of
the
few
exceptional
persons
who
always
remembered
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
proofs
of
his
friendly
interest
in
my
welfare
in
the
shape
of
letters
which
I
treasure
with
grateful
care
.
<EOS>
The
last
of
these
is
an
invitation
to
his
house
in
the
South
of
France
.
<EOS>
There
is
little
chance
at
present
of
my
being
able
to
profit
by
his
kindness
;
but
I
like
to
read
his
invitation
from
time
to
time
,
for
it
makes
me
fancy
,
in
my
happier
moments
,
that
I
may
one
day
really
be
able
to
accept
it
.
  
<EOS>
My
introduction
to
this
gentleman
,
in
my
capacity
of
portrait
-
painter
,
did
not
promise
much
for
me
in
a
professional
point
of
view
.
<EOS>
I
was
invited
to
Rockleigh
 
or
to
"
The
Place
,
"
as
it
was
more
frequently
called
among
the
people
of
the
county
 
to
take
a
likeness
in
water
-
colors
,
on
a
small
scale
,
of
the
French
governess
who
lived
with
Mr.
Lanfray
's
daughters
.
<EOS>
My
first
idea
on
hearing
of
this
was
,
that
the
governess
was
about
to
leave
her
situation
,
and
that
her
pupils
wished
to
have
a
memorial
of
her
in
the
shape
of
a
portrait
.
<EOS>
Subsequent
inquiry
,
however
,
informed
me
that
I
was
in
error
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
eldest
of
Mr.
Lanfray
's
daughters
,
who
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
house
to
accompany
her
husband
to
India
;
and
it
was
for
her
that
the
portrait
had
been
ordered
as
a
home
remembrance
of
her
best
and
dearest
friend
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
particulars
,
I
discovered
that
the
governess
,
though
still
called
"
mademoiselle
,
"
was
an
old
lady
;
that
Mr.
Lanfray
had
been
introduced
to
her
many
years
since
in
France
,
after
the
death
of
his
wife
;
that
she
was
absolute
mistress
in
the
house
;
and
that
her
three
pupils
had
always
looked
up
to
her
as
a
second
mother
,
from
the
time
when
their
father
first
placed
them
under
her
charge
.
  
<EOS>
These
scraps
of
information
made
me
rather
anxious
to
see
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
,
the
governess
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
appointed
for
my
attendance
at
the
comfortable
country
house
of
Rockleigh
,
I
was
detained
on
the
road
,
and
did
not
arrive
at
my
destination
until
late
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
The
welcome
accorded
to
me
by
Mr.
Lanfray
<EOS>
gave
an
earnest
of
the
unvarying
kindness
that
I
was
to
experience
at
his
hands
in
after
-
life
.
<EOS>
I
was
received
at
once
on
equal
terms
,
as
if
I
had
been
a
friend
of
the
family
,
and
was
presented
the
same
evening
to
my
host
's
daughters
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
merely
three
elegant
and
attractive
young
women
,
but
 
what
means
much
more
than
that
 
three
admirable
subjects
for
pictures
,
the
bride
particularly
.
<EOS>
Her
young
husband
did
not
strike
me
much
at
first
sight
;
he
seemed
rather
shy
and
silent
.
<EOS>
After
I
had
been
introduced
to
him
,
I
looked
round
for
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
,
but
she
was
not
present
;
and
I
was
soon
afterward
informed
by
Mr.
Lanfray
that
she
always
spent
the
latter
part
of
the
evening
in
her
own
room
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
breakfast
-
table
the
next
morning
,
I
again
looked
for
my
sitter
,
and
once
more
in
vain
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mamma
,
as
we
call
her
,
"
said
one
of
the
ladies
,
"
is
dressing
expressly
for
her
picture
,
Mr.
Kerby
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
not
above
painting
silk
,
lace
,
and
jewelry
.
<EOS>
The
dear
old
lady
,
who
is
perfection
in
everything
else
,
is
perfection
also
in
dress
,
and
is
bent
on
being
painted
in
all
her
splendor
.
"
  
<EOS>
This
explanation
prepared
me
for
something
extraordinary
;
but
I
found
that
my
anticipations
had
fallen
far
below
the
reality
when
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
at
last
made
her
appearance
,
and
announced
that
she
was
ready
to
sit
for
her
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
Never
before
or
since
have
I
seen
such
perfect
dressing
and
such
active
old
age
in
combination
.
<EOS>
"
Mademoiselle
"
was
short
and
thin
;
her
face
was
perfectly
white
all
over
,
the
skin
being
puckered
up
in
an
infinite
variety
of
the
smallest
possible
wrinkles
.
<EOS>
Her
bright
black
eyes
were
perfect
marvels
of
youthfulness
and
vivacity
.
<EOS>
They
sparkled
,
and
beamed
,
and
ogled
,
and
moved
about
over
everybody
and
everything
at
such
a
rate
,
that
the
plain
gray
hair
above
them
looked
unnaturally
venerable
,
and
the
wrinkles
below
an
artful
piece
of
masquerade
to
represent
old
age
.
<EOS>
As
for
her
dress
,
I
remember
few
harder
pieces
of
work
than
the
painting
of
it
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
silver
-
gray
silk
gown
that
seemed
always
flashing
out
into
some
new
light
whenever
she
moved
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
stiff
as
a
board
,
and
rustled
like
the
wind
.
<EOS>
Her
head
,
neck
,
and
bosom
were
enveloped
in
clouds
of
the
airiest
-
looking
lace
I
ever
saw
,
disposed
about
each
part
of
her
with
the
most
exquisite
grace
and
propriety
,
and
glistening
at
all
sorts
of
unexpected
places
with
little
fairy
-
like
toys
in
gold
and
precious
stones
.
<EOS>
On
her
right
wrist
she
wore
three
small
bracelets
,
with
the
hair
of
her
three
pupils
worked
into
them
;
and
on
her
left
,
one
large
bracelet
with
a
miniature
let
in
over
the
clasp
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
dark
crimson
and
gold
scarf
thrown
coquettishly
over
her
shoulders
,
and
held
a
lovely
little
feather
-
fan
in
her
hand
.
<EOS>
When
she
first
presented
herself
before
me
in
this
costume
,
with
a
brisk
courtesy
and
a
bright
smile
,
filling
the
room
with
perfume
,
and
gracefully
flirting
the
feather
-
fan
,
I
lost
all
confidence
in
my
powers
as
a
portrait
-
painter
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
brightest
colors
in
my
box
looked
dowdy
and
dim
,
and
I
myself
felt
like
an
unwashed
,
unbrushed
,
unpresentable
sloven
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
my
angels
,
"
said
mademoiselle
,
apostrophizing
her
pupils
in
the
prettiest
foreign
English
,
"
am
I
the
cream
of
all
creams
this
morning
?
<EOS>
Do
I
carry
my
sixty
years
resplendently
?
<EOS>
Will
the
savages
in
India
,
when
my
own
love
exhibits
my
picture
among
them
,
say
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
smart
!
<EOS>
smart
!
<EOS>
this
was
a
great
dandy
?
"
<EOS>
And
the
gentleman
,
the
skillful
artist
,
whom
it
is
even
more
an
honor
than
a
happiness
to
meet
,
does
he
approve
of
me
for
a
model
?
<EOS>
Does
he
find
me
pretty
and
paintable
from
top
to
toe
?
<EOS>
"
Here
she
dropped
me
another
brisk
courtesy
,
placed
herself
in
a
languishing
position
in
the
sitter
's
chair
,
and
asked
us
all
if
she
looked
like
a
shepherdess
in
Dresden
china
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
burst
out
laughing
,
and
mademoiselle
,
as
gay
as
any
of
them
and
a
great
deal
shriller
,
joined
in
the
merriment
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
I
contended
with
any
sitter
half
as
restless
as
that
wonderful
old
lady
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
had
I
begun
than
she
jumped
out
of
the
chair
,
and
exclaiming
,
"
Grand
Dieu
!
<EOS>
I
have
forgotten
to
embrace
my
angels
this
morning
,
"
ran
up
to
her
pupils
,
raised
herself
on
tiptoe
before
them
in
quick
succession
,
put
the
two
first
fingers
of
each
hand
under
their
ears
,
kissed
them
lightly
on
both
cheeks
,
and
was
back
again
in
the
chair
before
an
English
governess
could
have
said
,
"
Good
-
morning
,
my
dears
,
I
hope
you
all
slept
well
last
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
began
again
.
<EOS>
Up
jumped
mademoiselle
for
the
second
time
,
and
tripped
across
the
room
to
a
cheval
-
glass
.
"
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
"
I
heard
her
say
to
herself
,
"
I
have
not
discomposed
my
head
in
kissing
my
angels
.
<EOS>
I
may
come
back
and
pose
for
my
picture
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Back
she
came
.
<EOS>
I
worked
from
her
for
five
minutes
at
the
most
.
"
<EOS>
Stop
!
"
<EOS>
cries
mademoiselle
,
jumping
up
for
the
third
time
<EOS>
;
"
I
must
see
how
this
skillful
artist
is
getting
on
.
<EOS>
Grand
Dieu
!
<EOS>
why
he
has
done
nothing
!
"
  
<EOS>
For
the
fourth
time
I
began
,
and
for
the
fourth
time
the
old
lady
started
out
of
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
Now
I
must
repose
myself
,
"
said
mademoiselle
,
walking
lightly
from
end
to
end
of
the
room
,
and
humming
a
French
air
,
by
way
of
taking
a
rest
.
  
<EOS>
I
was
at
my
wit
's
end
,
and
the
young
ladies
saw
it
.
<EOS>
They
all
surrounded
my
unmanageable
sitter
,
and
appealed
to
her
compassion
for
me
.
"
<EOS>
Certainly
!
"
said
mademoiselle
,
expressing
astonishment
by
flinging
up
both
her
hands
with
all
the
fingers
spread
out
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
"
But
why
apostrophize
me
thus
?
<EOS>
I
am
here
,
I
am
ready
,
I
am
at
the
service
of
this
skillful
artist
.
<EOS>
Why
apostrophize
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
A
fortunate
chance
question
of
mine
steadied
her
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
inquired
if
I
was
expected
to
draw
the
whole
of
my
sitter
's
figure
as
well
as
her
face
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
replied
by
a
comic
scream
of
indignation
.
<EOS>
If
I
was
the
brave
and
gifted
man
for
whom
she
took
me
,
I
ought
to
be
ready
to
perish
rather
than
leave
out
an
inch
of
her
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Dress
was
her
passion
,
and
it
would
be
an
outrage
on
her
sentiments
if
I
did
not
do
full
justice
to
everything
she
had
on
 
to
her
robe
,
to
her
lace
,
to
her
scarf
,
to
her
fan
,
to
her
rings
,
her
jewels
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
her
bracelets
.
<EOS>
I
groaned
in
spirit
at
the
task
before
me
,
but
made
my
best
bow
of
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
was
not
to
be
satisfied
by
a
mere
bow
;
she
desired
the
pleasure
of
specially
directing
my
attention
,
if
I
would
be
so
amiable
as
to
get
up
and
approach
her
,
to
one
of
her
bracelets
in
particular
 
<EOS>
the
bracelet
with
the
miniature
,
on
her
left
wrist
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
the
gift
of
the
dearest
friend
she
ever
had
,
and
the
miniature
represented
that
friend
's
beloved
and
beautiful
face
.
<EOS>
Could
I
make
a
tiny
,
tiny
copy
of
that
likeness
in
my
drawing
!
<EOS>
Would
I
only
be
so
obliging
as
to
approach
for
one
little
moment
,
and
see
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
?
  
<EOS>
I
obeyed
unwillingly
enough
,
expecting
,
from
mademoiselle
's
expression
,
to
see
a
commonplace
portrait
of
some
unfortunate
admirer
whom
she
had
treated
with
unmerited
severity
in
the
days
of
her
youth
.
<EOS>
To
my
astonishment
,
I
found
that
the
miniature
,
which
was
very
beautifully
painted
,
represented
a
woman
's
face
 
<EOS>
a
young
woman
with
kind
,
sad
eyes
,
pale
,
delicate
cheeks
,
light
hair
,
and
such
a
pure
,
tender
,
lovely
expressions
that
I
thought
of
Raphael
's
Madonnas
the
moment
I
looked
at
her
portrait
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
lady
observed
the
impression
which
the
miniature
produced
on
me
,
and
nodded
her
head
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
a
beautiful
,
innocent
,
pure
face
!
<EOS>
"
I
said
.
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
gently
brushed
a
particle
of
dust
from
the
miniature
with
her
handkerchief
,
and
kissed
it
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
three
angels
still
left
,
"
she
said
,
looking
at
her
pupils
.
<EOS>
"
They
console
me
for
the
fourth
,
who
has
gone
to
heaven
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
patted
the
face
on
the
miniature
gently
with
her
little
,
withered
,
white
fingers
,
as
if
it
had
been
a
living
thing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sister
Rose
!
"
<EOS>
she
sighed
to
herself
;
then
,
looking
up
again
at
me
,
said
,
"
I
should
like
it
put
into
my
portrait
,
sir
,
because
I
have
always
worn
it
since
I
was
a
young
woman
,
for
"
Sister
Rose
's
"
sake
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
sudden
change
in
her
manner
,
from
the
extreme
of
flighty
gayety
to
the
extreme
of
quiet
sadness
,
would
have
looked
theatrical
in
a
woman
of
any
other
nation
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
,
however
,
perfectly
natural
and
appropriate
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
went
back
to
my
drawing
,
rather
perplexed
.
<EOS>
Who
was
"
Sister
Rose
"
?
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
Lanfray
family
,
apparently
.
<EOS>
The
composure
of
the
young
ladies
when
the
name
was
mentioned
showed
plainly
enough
that
the
original
of
the
miniature
had
been
no
relation
of
theirs
.
  
<EOS>
I
tried
to
stifle
my
curiosity
on
the
subject
of
Sister
Rose
,
by
giving
myself
entirely
to
my
work
.
<EOS>
For
a
full
half
-
hour
,
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
sat
quietly
before
me
,
with
her
hands
crossed
on
her
lap
,
and
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
bracelet
.
<EOS>
This
happy
alteration
enabled
me
to
do
something
toward
completing
the
outline
of
her
face
and
figure
.
<EOS>
I
might
even
,
under
fortunate
circumstances
,
have
vanquished
the
preliminary
difficulties
of
my
task
at
one
effort
;
but
the
fates
were
against
me
that
day
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
still
working
rapidly
and
to
my
satisfaction
,
a
servant
knocked
at
the
door
to
announce
luncheon
,
and
mademoiselle
lightly
roused
herself
from
her
serious
reflection
and
her
quiet
position
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
turning
the
miniature
round
on
her
wrist
till
it
was
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
"
What
animals
we
are
,
after
all
!
<EOS>
The
spiritual
part
of
us
is
at
the
mercy
of
the
stomach
.
<EOS>
My
heart
is
absorbed
by
tender
thoughts
,
yet
I
am
not
the
less
ready
for
luncheon
!
<EOS>
Come
,
my
children
and
fellow
-
mortals
.
<EOS>
Allons
cultiver
notre
jardin
!
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
quotation
from
"
Candide
,
"
plaintively
delivered
,
the
old
lady
led
the
way
out
of
the
room
,
and
was
followed
by
her
younger
pupils
.
<EOS>
The
eldest
sister
remained
behind
for
a
moment
,
and
reminded
me
that
the
lunch
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
have
found
the
dear
old
soul
rather
an
unruly
sitter
,
"
she
said
,
noticing
the
look
of
dissatisfaction
with
which
I
was
regarding
my
drawing
.
<EOS>
"
But
she
will
improve
as
you
go
on
.
<EOS>
She
has
done
better
already
for
the
last
half
-
hour
,
has
she
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Much
better
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
My
admiration
of
the
miniature
on
the
bracelet
seemed
 
I
suppose
,
by
calling
up
some
old
associations
 
to
have
a
strangely
soothing
effect
on
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
yes
!
<EOS>
only
remind
her
of
the
original
of
that
portrait
,
and
you
change
her
directly
,
whatever
she
may
have
been
saying
or
doing
the
moment
before
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
she
talks
of
Sister
Rose
,
and
of
all
that
she
went
through
in
the
time
of
the
French
Revolution
,
by
the
hour
together
.
<EOS>
It
is
wonderfully
interesting
 
at
least
we
all
think
so
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
presume
that
the
lady
described
as
"
Sister
Rose
"
<EOS>
was
a
relation
of
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
's
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
only
a
very
dear
friend
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
is
the
daughter
of
a
silk
-
mercer
,
once
established
at
Chalons
-
sur
-
Marne
.
<EOS>
Her
father
happened
to
give
an
asylum
in
his
office
to
a
lonely
old
man
,
to
whom
"
Sister
Rose
"
and
her
brother
had
been
greatly
indebted
in
the
revolutionary
time
;
and
out
of
a
train
of
circumstances
connected
with
that
,
the
first
acquaintance
between
mademoiselle
and
the
friend
whose
portrait
she
wears
,
arose
.
<EOS>
After
the
time
of
her
father
's
bankruptcy
,
and
for
many
years
before
we
were
placed
under
her
charge
,
our
good
old
governess
lived
entirely
with
"
Sister
Rose
"
and
her
brother
.
<EOS>
She
must
then
have
heard
all
the
interesting
things
that
she
has
since
often
repeated
to
my
sisters
and
myself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Might
I
suggest
,
"
said
I
,
after
an
instant
's
consideration
,
"
that
the
best
way
to
give
me
a
fair
chance
of
studying
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
's
face
at
the
next
sitting
,
would
be
to
lead
her
thoughts
again
to
that
quieting
subject
of
the
miniature
,
and
to
the
events
which
the
portrait
recalls
?
<EOS>
It
is
really
the
only
plan
,
after
what
I
have
observed
this
morning
,
that
I
can
think
of
for
enabling
me
to
do
myself
and
my
sitter
justice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
delighted
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
for
the
execution
of
your
plan
,
by
me
or
by
my
sisters
,
will
be
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
word
from
us
at
any
time
will
set
mademoiselle
thinking
,
and
talking
too
,
of
the
friend
of
her
youthful
days
.
<EOS>
Depend
on
our
assistance
so
far
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
me
show
you
the
way
to
the
luncheon
-
table
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Two
good
results
followed
the
ready
rendering
of
the
help
I
had
asked
from
my
host
's
daughters
.
<EOS>
I
succeeded
with
my
portrait
of
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
,
and
I
heard
the
story
which
occupies
the
following
pages
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
the
preceding
narratives
,
I
have
repeated
what
was
related
to
me
,
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
very
words
of
my
sitters
.
<EOS>
In
the
case
of
this
third
story
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
proceed
upon
the
same
plan
.
<EOS>
The
circumstances
of
"
Sister
Rose
's
"
eventful
history
were
narrated
to
me
at
different
times
,
and
in
the
most
fragmentary
and
discursive
manner
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
characteristically
mixed
up
with
the
direct
interest
of
her
story
,
not
only
references
to
places
and
people
which
had
no
recognizable
connection
with
it
,
but
outbursts
of
passionate
political
declamation
,
on
the
extreme
liberal
side
 
to
say
nothing
of
little
tender
apostrophes
to
her
beloved
friend
,
which
sounded
very
prettily
as
she
spoke
them
,
but
which
would
lose
their
effect
altogether
by
being
transferred
to
paper
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
I
have
thought
it
best
to
tell
the
story
in
my
own
way
 
rigidly
adhering
to
the
events
of
it
exactly
as
they
were
related
;
and
never
interfering
on
my
own
responsibility
except
to
keep
order
in
the
march
of
the
incidents
,
and
to
present
them
,
to
the
best
of
my
ability
,
variously
as
well
as
interestingly
to
the
reader
.

Well

Monsieur

what

the
news
this
evening
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
that
I
know
of
,
Monsieur
Justin
,
except
that
Mademoiselle
Rose
is
to
be
married
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Much
obliged
,
my
respectable
old
friend
,
for
so
interesting
and
unexpected
a
reply
to
my
question
.
<EOS>
Considering
that
I
am
the
valet
of
Monsieur
Danville
,
who
plays
the
distinguished
part
of
bridegroom
in
the
little
wedding
comedy
to
which
you
refer
,
I
think
I
may
assure
you
,
without
offense
,
that
your
news
is
,
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
of
the
stalest
possible
kind
.
<EOS>
Take
a
pinch
of
snuff
,
Monsieur
Guillaume
,
and
excuse
me
if
I
inform
you
that
my
question
referred
to
public
news
,
and
not
to
the
private
affairs
of
the
two
families
whose
household
interests
we
have
the
pleasure
of
promoting
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
understand
what
you
mean
by
such
a
phrase
as
promoting
household
interests
,
Monsieur
Justin
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
servant
of
Monsieur
Louis
Trudaine
,
who
lives
here
with
his
sister
,
Mademoiselle
Rose
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
servant
of
Monsieur
Danville
,
whose
excellent
mother
has
made
up
the
match
for
him
with
my
young
lady
.
<EOS>
As
servants
,
both
of
us
,
the
pleasantest
news
we
can
have
any
concern
with
is
news
that
is
connected
with
the
happiness
of
our
masters
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
public
affairs
;
and
,
being
one
of
the
old
school
<EOS>
,
I
make
it
my
main
object
in
life
to
mind
my
own
business
.
<EOS>
If
our
homely
domestic
politics
have
no
interests
for
you
,
allow
me
to
express
my
regret
,
and
to
wish
you
a
very
good
-
evening
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
<EOS>
my
dear
sir
,
I
have
not
the
slightest
respect
for
the
old
school
,
or
the
least
sympathy
with
people
who
only
mind
their
own
business
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
accept
your
expressions
of
regret
;
I
reciprocate
your
"
Good
-
evening
'
;
and
I
trust
to
find
you
improved
in
temper
,
dress
,
manners
,
and
appearance
the
next
time
<EOS>
I
have
the
honor
of
meeting
you
.
<EOS>
Adieu
,
Monsieur
Guillaume
,
and
!
<EOS>
Vive
la
bagatelle
!

These
scraps
of
dialogue
were
interchanged
on
a
lovely
summer
evening
in
the
year
seventeen
hundred
and
eighty
-
nine
,
before
the
back
door
of
a
small
house
which
stood
on
the
banks
of
the
Seine
,
about
three
miles
westward
of
the
city
of
Rouen
.
<EOS>
The
one
speaker
was
lean
,
old
,
crabbed
and
slovenly
;
the
other
was
plump
,
young
,
oily
-
mannered
and
dressed
in
the
most
gorgeous
livery
costume
of
the
period
.
<EOS>
The
last
days
of
genuine
dandyism
were
then
rapidly
approaching
all
over
the
civilized
world
;
and
Monsieur
Justin
was
,
in
his
own
way
,
dressed
to
perfection
,
as
a
living
illustration
of
the
expiring
glories
of
his
epoch
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
old
servant
had
left
him
,
he
occupied
himself
for
a
few
minutes
in
contemplating
,
superciliously
enough
,
the
back
view
of
the
little
house
before
which
he
stood
.
<EOS>
Judging
by
the
windows
,
it
did
not
contain
more
than
six
or
eight
rooms
in
all
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
stables
and
outhouses
,
there
was
a
conservatory
attached
to
the
building
on
one
side
,
and
a
low
,
long
room
,
built
of
wood
,
gayly
painted
,
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
windows
of
this
room
was
left
uncurtained
and
through
it
could
be
seen
,
on
a
sort
of
dresser
inside
,
bottles
filled
with
strangely
-
colored
liquids
oddly
-
shaped
utensils
of
brass
and
copper
,
one
end
of
a
large
furnace
,
and
other
objects
,
which
plainly
proclaimed
that
the
apartment
was
used
as
a
chemical
laboratory
.
  
<EOS>
"
Think
of
our
bride
's
brother
amusing
himself
in
such
a
place
as
that
with
cooking
drugs
in
saucepans
,
"
muttered
Monsieur
Justin
,
peeping
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
least
particular
man
in
the
universe
,
but
I
must
say
I
wish
we
were
not
going
to
be
connected
by
marriage
with
an
amateur
apothecary
.
<EOS>
Pah
!
<EOS>
I
can
smell
the
place
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
these
words
Monsieur
Justin
turned
his
back
on
the
laboratory
in
disgust
,
and
sauntered
toward
the
cliffs
overhanging
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
the
garden
attached
to
the
house
,
he
ascended
some
gently
rising
ground
by
a
winding
path
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
summit
,
the
whole
view
of
the
Seine
,
with
its
lovely
green
islands
,
its
banks
fringed
with
trees
,
its
gliding
boats
,
and
little
scattered
water
-
side
cottages
,
opened
before
him
.
<EOS>
Westward
,
where
the
level
country
appeared
beyond
the
further
bank
of
the
river
,
the
landscape
was
all
aglow
with
the
crimson
of
the
setting
sun
.
<EOS>
Eastward
,
the
long
shadows
and
mellow
intervening
lights
,
the
red
glory
that
quivered
on
the
rippling
water
,
the
steady
ruby
fire
glowing
on
cottage
windows
that
reflected
the
level
sunlight
,
led
the
eye
onward
and
onward
,
along
the
windings
of
the
Seine
,
until
it
rested
upon
the
spires
,
towers
,
and
broadly
-
massed
houses
of
Rouen
,
with
the
wooded
hills
rising
beyond
them
for
background
.
<EOS>
Lovely
to
look
on
at
any
time
,
the
view
was
almost
supernaturally
beautiful
now
under
the
gorgeous
evening
light
that
glowed
up
in
it
.
<EOS>
All
its
attractions
,
however
,
were
lost
on
the
valet
;
he
stood
yawning
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
,
but
staring
straight
before
him
at
a
little
hollow
,
beyond
which
the
ground
sloped
away
smoothly
to
the
brink
of
the
cliff
.
<EOS>
A
bench
was
placed
here
,
and
three
persons
 
<EOS>
an
old
lady
,
a
gentleman
,
and
a
young
girl
 
were
seated
on
it
,
watching
the
sunset
,
and
by
consequence
turning
their
backs
on
Monsieur
Justin
.
<EOS>
Near
them
stood
two
gentlemen
,
also
looking
toward
the
river
and
the
distant
view
.
<EOS>
These
five
figures
attracted
the
valet
's
attention
,
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
object
around
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
they
are
still
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
discontentedly
.
"
<EOS>
Madame
Danville
in
the
same
place
on
the
seat
;
my
master
,
the
bridegroom
,
dutifully
next
to
her
;
Mademoiselle
Rose
,
the
bride
,
bashfully
next
to
him
;
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
the
amateur
apothecary
brother
,
affectionately
next
to
her
;
and
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
our
queer
land
-
steward
,
officially
in
waiting
on
the
whole
party
.
<EOS>
There
they
all
are
indeed
,
incomprehensibly
wasting
their
time
still
in
looking
at
nothing
!
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
continued
Monsieur
Justin
,
lifting
his
eyes
wearily
,
and
staring
hard
,
first
up
the
river
at
Rouen
,
then
down
the
river
at
the
setting
sun
;
"
yes
,
plague
take
them
!
<EOS>
looking
at
nothing
,
absolutely
and
positively
at
nothing
,
all
this
while
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
Monsieur
Justin
yawned
again
,
and
,
returning
to
the
garden
,
sat
himself
down
in
an
arbor
and
resignedly
went
to
sleep
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
valet
had
ventured
near
the
five
persons
whom
he
had
been
apostrophizing
from
a
distance
,
and
if
he
had
been
possessed
of
some
little
refinement
of
observation
,
he
could
hardly
have
failed
to
remark
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
of
the
morrow
,
and
their
companions
on
either
side
,
were
all
,
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
,
under
the
influence
of
some
secret
restraint
,
which
affected
their
conversation
,
their
gestures
,
and
even
the
expression
of
their
faces
.
<EOS>
Madame
Danville
 
<EOS>
a
handsome
,
richly
-
dressed
old
lady
,
with
very
bright
eyes
,
and
a
quick
,
suspicious
manner
 
looked
composedly
and
happily
enough
,
as
long
as
her
attention
was
fixed
on
her
son
.
<EOS>
But
when
she
turned
from
him
toward
the
bride
,
a
hardly
perceptible
uneasiness
passed
over
her
face
 
<EOS>
an
uneasiness
which
only
deepened
to
positive
distrust
and
dissatisfaction
whenever
she
looked
toward
Mademoiselle
Trudaine
's
brother
.
<EOS>
In
the
same
way
,
her
son
,
who
was
all
smiles
and
happiness
while
he
was
speaking
with
his
future
wife
,
altered
visibly
in
manner
and
look
exactly
as
his
mother
altered
,
whenever
the
presence
of
Monsieur
Trudaine
specially
impressed
itself
on
his
attention
.
<EOS>
Then
,
again
,
Lomaque
,
the
land
-
steward
 
quiet
,
sharp
,
skinny
Lomaque
,
with
the
submissive
manner
,
and
the
red
-
rimmed
eyes
 
never
looked
up
at
his
master
's
future
brother
-
in
-
law
without
looking
away
again
rather
uneasily
,
and
thoughtfully
drilling
holes
in
the
grass
with
his
long
sharp
-
pointed
cane
.
<EOS>
Even
the
bride
herself
 
<EOS>
the
pretty
,
innocent
girl
,
with
her
childish
shyness
of
manner
 
seemed
to
be
affected
like
the
others
.
<EOS>
Doubt
,
if
not
distress
,
overshadowed
her
face
from
time
to
time
,
and
the
hand
which
her
lover
held
trembled
a
little
,
and
grew
restless
,
when
she
accidentally
caught
her
brother
's
eye
.
  
<EOS>
Strangely
enough
there
was
nothing
to
repel
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
everything
to
attract
in
the
look
and
manner
of
the
person
whose
mere
presence
seemed
to
exercise
such
a
curiously
constraining
influence
over
the
wedding
-
party
.
<EOS>
Louis
Trudaine
was
a
remarkably
handsome
man
.
<EOS>
His
expression
was
singularly
kind
and
gentle
;
his
manner
irresistibly
winning
in
its
frank
,
manly
firmness
and
composure
.
<EOS>
His
words
,
when
he
occasionally
spoke
,
seemed
as
unlikely
to
give
offense
as
his
looks
;
for
he
only
opened
his
lips
in
courteous
reply
to
questions
directly
addressed
to
him
.
<EOS>
Judging
by
a
latent
mournfulness
in
the
tones
of
his
voice
,
and
by
the
sorrowful
tenderness
which
clouded
his
kind
,
earnest
eyes
whenever
they
rested
on
his
sister
,
his
thoughts
were
certainly
not
of
the
happy
or
the
hopeful
kind
.
<EOS>
But
he
gave
them
no
direct
expression
;
he
intruded
his
secret
sadness
,
whatever
it
might
be
,
on
no
one
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
modest
and
self
-
restrained
as
he
was
,
there
was
evidently
some
reproving
or
saddening
influence
in
his
presence
which
affected
the
spirits
of
every
one
near
him
,
and
darkened
the
eve
of
the
wedding
to
bride
and
bridegroom
alike
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
sun
slowly
sank
in
the
heavens
,
the
conversation
flagged
more
and
more
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
silence
,
the
bridegroom
was
the
first
to
start
a
new
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
love
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
magnificent
sunset
is
a
good
omen
for
our
marriage
;
it
promises
another
lovely
day
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
bride
laughed
and
blushed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
really
believe
in
omens
,
Charles
?
"
<EOS>
she
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
,
"
interposed
the
old
lady
,
before
her
son
could
answer
,
"
if
Charles
does
believe
in
omens
,
it
is
nothing
to
laugh
at
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
know
better
,
when
you
are
his
wife
,
than
to
confound
him
,
even
in
the
slightest
things
,
with
the
common
herd
of
people
.
<EOS>
All
his
convictions
are
well
founded
 
so
well
,
that
if
I
thought
he
really
did
believe
in
omens
,
I
should
most
assuredly
make
up
my
mind
to
believe
in
them
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
madame
,
"
Rose
began
,
tremulously
,
"
I
only
meant
"
  
"
<EOS>
My
dear
child
,
have
you
so
little
knowledge
of
the
world
as
to
suppose
that
I
could
be
offended
"
  
"
<EOS>
Let
Rose
speak
,
"
said
the
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
round
petulantly
,
almost
with
the
air
of
a
spoiled
child
,
to
his
mother
,
as
he
said
those
words
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
looking
fondly
and
proudly
on
him
the
moment
before
.
<EOS>
Now
her
eyes
wandered
disconcertedly
from
his
face
;
she
hesitated
an
instant
with
a
sudden
confusion
which
seemed
quite
foreign
to
her
character
,
then
whispered
in
his
ear
,
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
blame
,
Charles
,
for
trying
to
make
her
worthy
of
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Her
son
took
no
notice
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
He
only
reiterated
sharply
,
"
Let
Rose
speak
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
really
had
nothing
to
say
,
"
faltered
the
young
girl
,
growing
more
and
more
confused
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
but
you
had
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
such
an
ungracious
sharpness
in
his
voice
,
such
an
outburst
of
petulance
in
his
manner
as
he
spoke
,
that
his
mother
gave
him
a
warning
touch
on
the
arm
,
and
whispered
"
Hush
!
"
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
the
land
-
steward
,
and
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
the
brother
,
both
glanced
searchingly
at
the
bride
,
as
the
words
passed
the
bridegroom
's
lips
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
frightened
and
astonished
,
rather
than
irritated
or
hurt
.
<EOS>
A
curious
smile
puckered
up
Lomaque
's
lean
face
,
as
he
looked
demurely
down
on
the
ground
,
and
began
drilling
a
fresh
hole
in
the
turf
with
the
sharp
point
of
his
cane
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
turned
aside
quickly
,
and
,
sighing
,
walked
away
a
few
paces
;
then
came
back
,
and
seemed
about
to
speak
,
but
Danville
interrupted
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pardon
me
,
Rose
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
am
so
jealous
of
even
the
appearance
of
any
want
of
attention
toward
you
,
that
I
was
nearly
allowing
myself
to
be
irritated
about
nothing
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
kissed
her
hand
very
gracefully
and
tenderly
as
he
made
his
excuse
;
but
there
was
a
latent
expression
in
his
eye
which
was
at
variance
with
the
apparent
spirit
of
his
action
.
<EOS>
It
was
noticed
by
nobody
but
observant
and
submissive
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
who
smiled
to
himself
again
,
and
drilled
harder
than
ever
at
his
hole
in
the
grass
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
Monsieur
Trudaine
was
about
to
speak
,
"
said
Madame
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
he
will
have
no
objection
to
let
us
hear
what
he
was
going
to
say
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
None
,
madame
,
"
replied
Trudaine
,
politely
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
take
upon
myself
the
blame
of
Rose
's
want
of
respect
for
believers
in
omens
,
by
confessing
that
I
have
always
encouraged
her
to
laugh
at
superstitions
of
every
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
a
ridiculer
of
superstitions
?
"
said
Danville
,
turning
quickly
on
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
,
who
have
built
a
laboratory
;
you
,
who
are
an
amateur
professor
of
the
occult
arts
of
chemistry
 
a
seeker
after
the
Elixir
of
Life
.
<EOS>
On
my
word
of
honor
,
you
astonish
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
ironical
politeness
in
his
voice
,
look
,
and
manner
as
he
said
this
,
which
his
mother
and
his
land
-
steward
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
evidently
knew
how
to
interpret
.
<EOS>
The
first
touched
his
arm
again
and
whispered
,
"
Be
careful
!
"
<EOS>
the
second
suddenly
grew
serious
,
and
left
off
drilling
his
hole
in
the
grass
.
<EOS>
Rose
neither
heard
the
warning
of
Madame
Danville
,
nor
noticed
the
alteration
in
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
She
was
looking
round
at
her
brother
,
and
was
waiting
with
a
bright
,
affectionate
smile
to
hear
his
answer
.
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
as
if
to
reassure
her
,
before
he
spoke
again
to
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
rather
romantic
ideas
about
experiments
in
chemistry
,
"
he
said
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
Mine
have
so
little
connection
with
what
you
call
the
occult
arts
that
all
the
world
might
see
them
,
if
all
the
world
thought
it
worth
while
.
<EOS>
The
only
Elixirs
of
Life
that
I
know
of
are
a
quiet
heart
and
a
contented
mind
.
<EOS>
Both
those
I
found
,
years
and
years
ago
,
when
Rose
and
I
first
came
to
live
together
in
the
house
yonder
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
with
a
quiet
sadness
in
his
voice
,
which
meant
far
more
to
his
sister
than
the
simple
words
he
uttered
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
filled
with
tears
;
she
turned
for
a
moment
from
her
lover
,
and
took
her
brother
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
talk
,
Louis
,
as
if
you
thought
you
were
going
to
lose
your
sister
,
because
"
Her
lips
began
to
tremble
,
and
she
stopped
suddenly
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
jealous
than
ever
of
your
taking
her
away
from
him
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Madame
Danville
in
her
son
's
ear
.
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
do
n't
,
for
God
's
sake
,
take
any
notice
of
it
,
"
she
added
,
hurriedly
,
as
he
rose
from
the
seat
and
faced
Trudaine
with
undisguised
irritation
and
impatience
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
speak
,
the
old
servant
Guillaume
made
his
appearance
,
and
announced
that
coffee
was
ready
.
<EOS>
Madame
Danville
again
said
"
Hush
!
"
and
quickly
took
one
of
his
arms
,
while
he
offered
the
other
to
Rose
.
<EOS>
"
Charles
,
"
said
the
young
girl
,
amazedly
,
"
how
flushed
your
face
is
,
and
how
your
arm
trembles
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
controlled
himself
in
a
moment
,
smiled
,
and
said
to
her
:
"
Ca
n't
you
guess
why
,
Rose
?
<EOS>
I
am
thinking
of
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
While
he
was
speaking
,
he
passed
close
by
the
land
-
steward
,
on
his
way
back
to
the
house
with
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
The
smile
returned
to
Monsieur
Lomaque
's
lean
face
,
and
a
curious
light
twinkled
in
his
red
-
rimmed
eyes
as
he
began
a
fresh
hole
in
the
grass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
you
go
indoors
,
and
take
some
coffee
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Trudaine
,
touching
the
land
-
steward
on
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Lomaque
started
a
little
and
left
his
cane
sticking
in
the
ground
.
"
<EOS>
A
thousand
thanks
,
monsieur
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
may
I
be
allowed
to
follow
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
confess
the
beauty
of
the
evening
makes
me
a
little
unwilling
to
leave
this
place
just
yet
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
the
beauties
of
Nature
 
I
feel
them
with
you
,
Monsieur
Trudaine
;
I
feel
them
here
.
<EOS>
"
Saying
this
,
Lomaque
laid
one
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
with
the
other
pulled
his
stick
out
of
the
grass
.
<EOS>
He
had
looked
as
little
at
the
landscape
or
the
setting
sun
as
Monsieur
Justin
himself
.
  
<EOS>
They
sat
down
,
side
by
side
,
on
the
empty
bench
;
and
then
there
followed
an
awkward
pause
.
<EOS>
Submissive
Lomaque
was
too
discreet
to
forget
his
place
,
and
venture
on
starting
a
new
topic
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
was
preoccupied
,
and
disinclined
to
talk
.
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
,
however
,
in
common
politeness
,
to
say
something
.
<EOS>
Hardly
attending
himself
to
his
own
words
,
he
began
with
a
commonplace
phrase
:
"
I
regret
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
that
we
have
not
had
more
opportunities
of
bettering
our
acquaintance
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
deeply
indebted
,
"
rejoined
the
land
-
steward
,
"
to
the
admirable
Madame
Danville
for
having
chosen
me
as
her
escort
hither
from
her
son
's
estate
near
Lyons
,
and
having
thereby
procured
for
me
the
honor
of
this
introduction
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Both
Monsieur
Lomaque
's
red
-
rimmed
eyes
were
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
winking
,
as
he
made
this
polite
speech
.
<EOS>
His
enemies
were
accustomed
to
say
that
,
whenever
he
was
particularly
insincere
,
or
particularly
deceitful
,
he
always
took
refuge
in
the
weakness
of
his
eyes
,
and
so
evaded
the
trying
ordeal
of
being
obliged
to
look
steadily
at
the
person
whom
he
was
speaking
with
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
pleased
to
hear
you
mention
my
late
father
's
name
,
at
dinner
,
in
terms
of
high
respect
,
"
continued
Trudaine
,
resolutely
keeping
up
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
indirectly
indebted
to
your
excellent
father
,
"
answered
the
land
-
steward
,
"
for
the
very
situation
which
I
now
hold
.
<EOS>
At
a
time
when
the
good
word
of
a
man
of
substance
and
reputation
was
needed
to
save
me
from
poverty
and
ruin
,
your
father
spoke
that
word
.
<EOS>
Since
then
I
have
,
in
my
own
very
small
way
,
succeeded
in
life
,
until
I
have
risen
to
the
honor
of
superintending
the
estate
of
Monsieur
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
but
your
way
of
speaking
of
your
present
situation
rather
surprises
me
.
<EOS>
Your
father
,
I
believe
,
was
a
merchant
,
just
as
Danville
's
father
was
a
merchant
;
the
only
difference
between
them
was
that
one
failed
and
the
other
realized
a
large
fortune
.
<EOS>
Why
should
you
speak
of
yourself
as
honored
by
holding
your
present
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
never
heard
?
"
exclaimed
Lomaque
,
with
an
appearance
of
great
astonishment
,
"
or
can
you
have
heard
,
and
forgotten
,
that
Madame
Danville
is
descended
from
one
of
the
noble
houses
of
France
?
<EOS>
Has
she
never
told
you
,
as
she
has
often
told
me
,
that
she
condescended
when
she
married
her
late
husband
;
and
that
her
great
object
in
life
is
to
get
the
title
of
her
family
<EOS>
(
years
since
extinct
in
the
male
line
)
settled
on
her
son
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
replied
Trudaine
;
"
I
remember
to
have
heard
something
of
this
,
and
to
have
paid
no
great
attention
to
it
at
the
time
,
having
little
sympathy
with
such
aspirations
as
you
describe
.
<EOS>
You
have
lived
many
years
in
Danville
's
service
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
;
have
you
"
 
h
e
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
then
continued
,
looking
the
land
-
steward
full
in
the
face
 
<EOS>
"
have
you
found
him
a
good
and
kind
master
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
's
thin
lips
seemed
to
close
instinctively
at
the
question
,
as
if
he
were
never
going
to
speak
again
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
 
Trudaine
waited
 
<EOS>
he
only
bowed
again
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
waited
a
third
time
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
looked
at
his
host
with
perfect
steadiness
for
an
instant
,
then
his
eyes
began
to
get
weak
again
.
<EOS>
"
You
seem
to
have
some
special
interest
,
"
he
quietly
remarked
,
"
if
I
may
say
so
without
offense
,
in
asking
me
that
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
deal
frankly
,
at
all
hazards
,
with
every
one
,
"
returned
Trudaine
;
"
and
stranger
as
you
are
,
I
will
deal
frankly
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
acknowledge
that
I
have
an
interest
in
asking
that
question
 
the
dearest
,
the
tenderest
of
all
interests
.
<EOS>
"
At
those
last
words
,
his
voice
trembled
for
a
moment
,
but
he
went
on
firmly
;
"
from
the
beginning
of
my
sister
's
engagement
with
Danville
,
I
made
it
my
duty
not
to
conceal
my
own
feelings
;
my
conscience
and
my
affection
for
Rose
counseled
me
to
be
candid
to
the
last
,
even
though
my
candor
should
distress
or
offend
others
.
<EOS>
When
we
first
made
the
acquaintance
of
Madame
Danville
,
and
when
I
first
discovered
that
her
son
's
attentions
to
Rose
were
not
unfavorably
received
,
I
felt
astonished
,
and
,
though
it
cost
me
a
hard
effort
,
I
did
not
conceal
that
astonishment
from
my
sister
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
,
who
had
hitherto
been
all
attention
,
started
here
,
and
threw
up
his
hands
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Astonished
,
did
I
hear
you
say
?
<EOS>
Astonished
,
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
that
the
attentions
of
a
young
gentleman
,
possessed
of
all
the
graces
and
accomplishments
of
a
highly
-
bred
Frenchman
,
should
be
favorably
received
by
a
young
lady
!
<EOS>
Astonished
that
such
a
dancer
,
such
a
singer
,
such
a
talker
,
such
a
notoriously
fascinating
ladies
'
man
as
Monsieur
Danville
,
should
,
by
dint
of
respectful
assiduity
,
succeed
in
making
some
impression
on
the
heart
of
Mademoiselle
Rose
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
venerated
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
this
is
almost
too
much
to
credit
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
's
eyes
grew
weaker
than
ever
,
and
winked
incessantly
as
he
uttered
this
apostrophe
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
,
he
threw
up
his
hands
again
,
and
blinked
inquiringly
all
round
him
,
in
mute
appeal
to
universal
nature
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
,
in
the
course
of
time
,
matters
were
further
advanced
,
"
continued
Trudaine
,
without
paying
any
attention
to
the
interruption
;
"
when
the
offer
of
marriage
was
made
,
and
when
I
knew
that
Rose
had
in
her
own
heart
accepted
it
,
I
objected
,
and
I
did
not
conceal
my
objections
"
  
"
Heavens
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Lomaque
again
,
clasping
his
hands
this
time
with
a
look
of
bewilderment
;
"
what
objections
,
what
possible
objections
to
a
man
young
and
well
-
bred
,
with
an
immense
fortune
and
an
uncompromised
character
?
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
these
objections
;
I
know
they
have
made
bad
blood
;
and
I
ask
myself
again
and
again
,
what
can
they
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
God
knows
I
have
often
tried
to
dismiss
them
from
my
mind
as
fanciful
and
absurd
,
"
said
Trudaine
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
have
always
failed
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
in
your
presence
,
that
I
can
describe
in
detail
what
my
own
impressions
have
been
,
from
the
first
,
of
the
master
whom
you
serve
.
<EOS>
Let
it
be
enough
if
I
confide
to
you
that
I
can
not
,
even
now
,
persuade
myself
of
the
sincerity
of
his
attachment
to
my
sister
,
and
that
I
feel
 
in
spite
of
myself
,
in
spite
of
my
earnest
desire
to
put
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
Rose
's
choice
 
a
distrust
of
his
character
and
temper
,
which
now
,
on
the
eve
of
the
marriage
,
amounts
to
positive
terror
.
<EOS>
Long
secret
suffering
,
doubt
,
and
suspense
,
wring
this
confession
from
me
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
almost
unawares
,
in
defiance
of
caution
,
in
defiance
of
all
the
conventionalities
of
society
.
<EOS>
You
have
lived
for
years
under
the
same
roof
with
this
man
;
you
have
seen
him
in
his
most
unguarded
and
private
moments
.
<EOS>
I
tempt
you
to
betray
no
confidence
 
<EOS>
I
only
ask
you
if
you
can
make
me
happy
by
telling
me
that
I
have
been
doing
your
master
grievous
injustice
by
my
opinion
of
him
?
<EOS>
I
ask
you
to
take
my
hand
,
and
tell
me
if
you
can
,
in
all
honor
,
that
my
sister
is
not
risking
the
happiness
of
her
whole
life
by
giving
herself
in
marriage
to
Danville
to
-
morrow
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
while
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
By
some
strange
chance
,
Lomaque
happened
just
at
that
moment
to
be
looking
away
toward
those
beauties
of
Nature
which
he
admired
so
greatly
.
"
<EOS>
Really
,
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
really
such
an
appeal
from
you
,
at
such
a
time
,
amazes
me
.
<EOS>
"
Having
got
so
far
,
he
stopped
and
said
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
we
first
sat
down
together
here
,
I
had
no
thought
of
making
this
appeal
,
no
idea
of
talking
to
you
as
I
have
talked
,
"
pursued
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
My
words
have
escaped
me
,
as
I
told
you
,
almost
unawares
;
you
must
make
allowances
for
them
and
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
expect
others
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
to
appreciate
and
understand
my
feelings
for
Rose
.
<EOS>
We
two
have
lived
alone
in
the
world
together
;
father
,
mother
,
kindred
,
they
all
died
years
since
,
and
left
us
.
<EOS>
I
am
so
much
older
than
my
sister
that
I
have
learned
to
feel
toward
her
more
as
a
father
than
as
a
brother
.
<EOS>
All
my
life
,
all
my
dearest
hopes
,
all
my
highest
expectations
,
have
centered
in
her
.
<EOS>
I
was
past
the
period
of
my
boyhood
when
my
mother
put
my
little
child
sister
's
hand
in
mine
,
and
said
to
me
on
her
death
-
bed
:
"
Louis
,
be
all
to
her
that
I
have
been
,
for
she
has
no
one
left
to
look
to
<EOS>
but
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Since
then
the
loves
and
ambitions
of
other
men
have
not
been
my
loves
or
my
ambitions
.
<EOS>
Sister
Rose
 
as
we
all
used
to
call
her
in
those
past
days
,
as
I
love
to
call
her
<EOS>
still
 
Sister
Rose
has
been
the
one
aim
,
the
one
happiness
,
the
one
precious
trust
,
the
one
treasured
reward
,
of
all
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
lived
in
this
poor
house
,
in
this
dull
retirement
,
as
in
a
paradise
,
because
Sister
Rose
 
my
innocent
,
happy
,
bright
-
faced
Eve
 
has
lived
here
with
me
.
<EOS>
Even
if
the
husband
of
her
choice
had
been
the
husband
of
mine
,
the
necessity
of
parting
with
her
would
have
been
the
hardest
,
the
bitterest
of
trials
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
thinking
what
I
think
,
dreading
what
I
dread
,
judge
what
my
feelings
must
be
on
the
eve
of
her
marriage
;
and
know
why
,
and
with
what
object
,
I
made
the
appeal
which
surprised
you
a
moment
since
,
but
which
can
not
surprise
you
now
.
<EOS>
Speak
if
you
will
 
<EOS>
I
can
say
no
more
.
"
<EOS>
He
sighed
bitterly
;
his
head
dropped
on
his
breast
,
and
the
hand
which
he
had
extended
to
Lomaque
trembled
as
he
withdrew
it
and
let
it
fall
at
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
The
land
-
steward
was
not
a
man
accustomed
to
hesitate
,
but
he
hesitated
now
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
usually
at
a
loss
for
phrases
in
which
to
express
himself
,
but
he
stammered
at
the
very
outset
of
his
reply
.
"
<EOS>
Suppose
I
answered
,
"
he
began
,
slowly
;
"
suppose
I
told
you
that
you
wronged
him
,
would
my
testimony
really
be
strong
enough
to
shake
opinions
,
or
rather
presumptions
,
which
have
been
taking
firmer
and
firmer
hold
of
you
for
months
and
months
past
?
<EOS>
Suppose
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
my
master
had
his
little
"
<EOS>
(
Lomaque
hesitated
before
he
pronounced
the
next
word
)
 
<EOS>
"
his
little
 
infirmities
,
let
me
say
;
but
only
hypothetically
,
mind
that
 
infirmities
;
and
suppose
I
had
observed
them
,
and
was
willing
to
confide
them
to
you
,
what
purpose
would
such
a
confidence
answer
now
,
at
the
eleventh
hour
,
with
Mademoiselle
Rose
's
heart
engaged
,
with
the
marriage
fixed
for
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
trust
me
<EOS>
"
  
Trudaine
looked
up
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
reminding
me
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
that
it
is
too
late
now
to
make
inquiries
,
and
by
consequence
too
late
also
to
trust
in
others
.
<EOS>
My
sister
has
chosen
;
and
on
the
subject
of
that
choice
my
lips
shall
be
henceforth
sealed
.
<EOS>
The
events
of
the
future
are
with
God
;
whatever
they
may
be
,
I
hope
I
am
strong
enough
to
bear
my
part
in
them
with
the
patience
and
the
courage
of
a
man
!
<EOS>
I
apologize
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
for
having
thoughtlessly
embarrassed
you
by
questions
which
I
had
no
right
to
ask
.
<EOS>
Let
us
return
to
the
house
 
<EOS>
I
will
show
you
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
's
lips
opened
,
then
closed
again
;
he
bowed
uneasily
,
and
his
sallow
complexion
whitened
for
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
led
the
way
in
silence
back
to
the
house
;
the
land
-
steward
following
slowly
at
a
distance
of
several
paces
,
and
talking
in
whispers
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
His
father
was
the
saving
of
me
,
"
muttered
Lomaque
;
"
that
is
truth
,
and
there
is
no
getting
over
it
;
his
father
was
the
saving
of
me
;
and
yet
here
am
I
 
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
it
's
too
late
!
 
<EOS>
too
late
to
speak
 
too
late
to
act
 
too
late
to
do
anything
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Close
to
the
house
they
were
met
by
the
old
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
young
lady
has
just
sent
me
to
call
you
in
to
coffee
,
monsieur
,
"
said
Guillaume
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
kept
a
cup
hot
for
you
,
and
another
cup
for
Monsieur
Lomaque
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
land
-
steward
started
 
this
time
with
genuine
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
For
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
"
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Rose
has
troubled
herself
to
keep
a
cup
of
coffee
hot
for
me
?
"
<EOS>
The
old
servant
stared
;
Trudaine
stopped
and
looked
back
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
there
so
very
surprising
,
"
he
asked
,
"
in
such
an
ordinary
act
of
politeness
on
my
sister
's
part
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
"
answered
Lomaque
;
<EOS>
"
you
have
not
passed
such
an
existence
as
mine
 
<EOS>
you
are
not
a
friendless
old
man
 
<EOS>
you
have
a
settled
position
in
the
world
,
and
are
used
to
be
treated
with
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
first
occasion
in
my
life
on
which
I
find
myself
an
object
for
the
attention
of
a
young
lady
,
and
it
takes
me
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
my
excuses
;
pray
let
us
go
in
.
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
made
no
reply
to
this
curious
explanation
.
<EOS>
He
wondered
at
it
a
little
,
however
,
and
he
wondered
still
more
when
,
on
entering
the
drawing
-
room
,
he
saw
Lomaque
walk
straight
up
to
his
sister
,
and
 
apparently
not
noticing
that
Danville
was
sitting
at
the
harpsichord
and
singing
at
the
time
 
<EOS>
address
her
confusedly
and
earnestly
with
a
set
speech
of
thanks
for
his
hot
cup
of
coffee
.
<EOS>
Rose
looked
perplexed
,
and
half
inclined
to
laugh
,
as
she
listened
to
him
.
<EOS>
Madame
Danville
,
who
sat
by
her
side
,
frowned
,
and
tapped
the
land
-
steward
contemptuously
on
the
arm
with
her
fan
.
  
<EOS>
"
Be
so
good
as
to
keep
silent
until
my
son
has
done
singing
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
made
a
low
bow
,
and
retiring
to
a
table
in
a
corner
,
took
up
a
newspaper
lying
on
it
.
<EOS>
If
Madame
Danville
had
seen
the
expression
that
came
over
his
face
when
he
turned
away
from
her
,
proud
as
she
was
,
her
aristocratic
composure
might
possibly
have
been
a
little
ruffled
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
had
finished
his
song
,
had
quitted
the
harpsichord
,
and
was
talking
in
whispers
to
his
bride
;
Madame
Danville
was
adding
a
word
to
the
conversation
every
now
and
then
;
Trudaine
was
seated
apart
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
,
thoughtfully
reading
a
letter
which
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
,
when
an
exclamation
from
Lomaque
,
who
was
still
engaged
with
the
newspaper
,
caused
all
the
other
occupants
of
the
apartment
to
suspend
their
employments
and
look
up
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Danville
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
be
interrupting
if
I
explain
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Lomaque
,
getting
very
weak
in
the
eyes
again
,
as
he
deferentially
addressed
himself
to
Madame
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
already
interrupted
us
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
sharply
;
"
<EOS>
so
you
may
now
just
as
well
explain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
passage
from
the
Scientific
Intelligence
which
has
given
me
great
delight
,
and
which
will
be
joyful
news
for
every
one
here
.
"
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
Lomaque
looked
significantly
at
Trudaine
,
and
then
read
from
the
newspaper
these
lines
:
  
"
ACADEMY
OF
SCIENCES
,
PARIS
.
 
<EOS>
The
vacant
sub
-
professorship
of
chemistry
has
been
offered
,
we
are
rejoiced
to
hear
,
to
a
gentleman
<EOS>
whose
modesty
has
hitherto
prevented
his
scientific
merits
from
becoming
sufficiently
prominent
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
To
the
members
of
the
academy
he
has
been
long
since
known
as
the
originator
of
some
of
the
most
remarkable
improvements
in
chemistry
which
have
been
made
of
late
years
 
improvements
,
the
credit
of
which
he
has
,
with
rare
,
and
we
were
almost
about
to
add
,
culpable
moderation
,
allowed
others
to
profit
by
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
No
man
in
any
profession
is
more
thoroughly
entitled
to
have
a
position
of
trust
and
distinction
conferred
on
him
by
the
State
than
the
gentleman
to
whom
we
refer
 
M.
Louis
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Lomaque
could
look
up
from
the
paper
to
observe
the
impression
which
his
news
produced
,
Rose
had
gained
her
brother
's
side
and
was
kissing
him
in
a
flutter
of
delight
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Louis
,
"
she
cried
,
clapping
her
hands
,
"
let
me
be
the
first
to
congratulate
you
!
<EOS>
How
proud
and
glad
I
am
!
<EOS>
You
accept
the
professorship
,
of
course
?
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
,
who
had
hastily
and
confusedly
put
his
letter
back
in
his
pocket
the
moment
Lomaque
began
to
read
,
seemed
at
a
loss
for
an
answer
.
<EOS>
He
patted
his
sister
's
hand
rather
absently
,
and
said
:
  
"
I
have
not
made
up
my
mind
;
do
n't
ask
me
<EOS>
why
,
Rose
 
at
least
not
now
,
not
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
expression
of
perplexity
and
distress
came
over
his
face
,
as
he
gently
motioned
her
to
resume
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
is
a
sub
-
professor
of
chemistry
supposed
to
hold
the
rank
of
a
gentleman
?
"
asked
Madame
Danville
,
without
the
slightest
appearance
of
any
special
interest
in
Lomaque
's
news
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
not
,
"
replied
her
son
,
with
a
sarcastic
laugh
;
"
he
is
expected
to
work
and
make
himself
useful
.
<EOS>
What
gentleman
does
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charles
!
"
exclaimed
the
old
lady
,
reddening
with
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Danville
,
turning
his
back
on
her
,
"
enough
of
chemistry
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
,
now
you
have
begun
reading
the
newspaper
,
try
if
you
ca
n't
find
something
interesting
to
read
about
.
<EOS>
What
are
the
last
accounts
from
Paris
?
<EOS>
Any
more
symptoms
of
a
general
revolt
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
turned
to
another
part
of
the
paper
.
<EOS>
"
Bad
,
very
bad
prospects
for
the
restoration
of
tranquillity
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Necker
,
the
people
's
Minister
,
is
dismissed
.
<EOS>
Placards
against
popular
gatherings
are
posted
all
over
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
Swiss
Guards
have
been
ordered
to
the
Champs
Elysees
,
with
four
pieces
of
artillery
.
<EOS>
No
more
is
yet
known
,
but
the
worst
is
dreaded
.
<EOS>
The
breach
between
the
aristocracy
and
the
people
is
widening
fatally
almost
hour
by
hour
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
he
stopped
and
laid
down
the
newspaper
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
took
it
from
him
,
and
shook
his
head
forebodingly
as
he
looked
over
the
paragraph
which
had
just
been
read
.
  
<EOS>
"
Bah
!
"
cried
Madame
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
People
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
Let
those
four
pieces
of
artillery
be
properly
loaded
,
let
the
Swiss
Guards
do
their
duty
,
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
the
People
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
advise
you
not
to
be
sure
of
that
,
"
said
her
son
,
carelessly
;
"
there
are
rather
too
many
people
in
Paris
for
the
Swiss
Guards
to
shoot
conveniently
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
hold
your
head
too
aristocratically
high
,
mother
,
till
we
are
quite
certain
which
way
the
wind
really
does
blow
.
<EOS>
Who
knows
if
I
may
not
have
to
bow
just
as
low
one
of
these
days
to
King
Mob
as
ever
you
courtesied
in
your
youth
to
King
Louis
the
Fifteenth
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
laughed
complacently
as
he
ended
,
and
opened
his
snuff
-
box
.
<EOS>
His
mother
rose
from
her
chair
,
her
face
crimson
with
indignation
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wo
n't
hear
you
talk
so
 
<EOS>
it
shocks
,
it
horrifies
me
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
with
vehement
gesticulation
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
I
decline
to
hear
another
word
.
<EOS>
I
decline
to
sit
by
patiently
while
my
son
,
whom
I
love
,
jests
at
the
most
sacred
principles
,
and
sneers
at
the
memory
of
an
anointed
king
.
<EOS>
This
is
my
reward
,
is
it
,
for
having
yielded
and
having
come
here
,
against
all
the
laws
of
etiquette
,
the
night
before
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
I
comply
no
longer
;
I
resume
my
own
will
and
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
I
order
you
,
my
son
,
to
accompany
me
back
to
Rouen
.
<EOS>
We
are
the
bridegroom
's
party
,
and
we
have
no
business
overnight
at
the
house
of
the
bride
.
<EOS>
You
meet
no
more
till
you
meet
at
the
church
.
<EOS>
Justin
,
my
coach
!
<EOS>
Lomaque
,
pick
up
my
hood
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
thanks
for
your
hospitality
;
I
shall
hope
to
return
it
with
interest
the
first
time
you
are
in
our
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
,
put
on
your
best
looks
to
-
morrow
,
along
with
your
wedding
finery
;
remember
that
my
son
's
bride
must
do
honor
to
my
son
's
taste
.
<EOS>
Justin
!
<EOS>
my
coach
 
drone
,
vagabond
,
idiot
,
where
is
my
coach
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mother
looks
handsome
when
she
is
in
a
passion
,
does
she
not
,
Rose
?
<EOS>
"
said
Danville
,
quietly
putting
up
his
snuff
-
box
as
the
old
lady
sailed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
seem
quite
frightened
,
love
,
"
he
added
,
taking
her
hand
with
his
easy
,
graceful
air
;
"
frightened
,
let
me
assure
you
,
without
the
least
cause
.
<EOS>
My
mother
has
but
that
one
prejudice
,
and
that
one
weak
point
,
Rose
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
her
a
very
dove
for
gentleness
,
as
long
as
you
do
not
wound
her
pride
of
caste
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
on
this
night
,
of
all
others
,
you
must
not
send
me
away
with
such
a
face
as
that
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
bent
down
and
whispered
to
her
a
bridegroom
's
compliment
,
which
brought
the
blood
back
to
her
cheek
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
how
she
loves
him
 
how
dearly
she
loves
him
!
"
thought
her
brother
,
watching
her
from
his
solitary
corner
of
the
room
,
and
seeing
the
smile
that
brightened
her
blushing
face
when
Danville
kissed
her
hand
at
parting
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
,
who
had
remained
imperturbably
cool
during
the
outbreak
of
the
old
lady
's
anger
 
Lomaque
,
whose
observant
eyes
had
watched
sarcastically
the
effect
of
the
scene
between
mother
and
son
on
Trudaine
and
his
sister
,
was
the
last
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
bowed
to
Rose
with
a
certain
gentleness
in
his
manner
,
which
contrasted
strangely
with
his
wrinkled
,
haggard
face
,
he
held
out
his
hand
to
her
brother
"
<EOS>
I
did
not
take
your
hand
when
we
sat
together
on
the
bench
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
may
I
take
it
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
met
his
advance
courteously
,
but
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
alter
your
opinion
of
me
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
"
Adding
those
words
in
a
whisper
,
Monsieur
Lomaque
bowed
once
more
to
the
bride
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
after
the
door
had
closed
the
brother
and
sister
kept
silence
.
<EOS>
"
Our
last
night
together
at
home
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
was
the
thought
which
now
filled
the
heart
of
each
.
<EOS>
Rose
was
the
first
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Hesitating
a
little
as
she
approached
her
brother
,
she
said
to
him
,
anxiously
:
  
"
I
am
sorry
for
what
happened
with
Madame
Danville
,
Louis
.
<EOS>
Does
it
make
you
think
the
worse
of
Charles
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
allowance
for
Madame
Danville
's
anger
,
"
returned
Trudaine
,
evasively
,
"
because
she
spoke
from
honest
conviction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Honest
?
"
echoed
Rose
,
sadly
,
"
honest
?
 
<EOS>
ah
,
Louis
!
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
thinking
disparagingly
of
Charles
's
convictions
,
when
you
speak
so
of
his
mother
's
.
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
smiled
and
shook
his
head
;
but
she
took
no
notice
of
the
gesture
of
denial
 
only
stood
looking
earnestly
and
wistfully
into
his
face
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
began
to
fill
;
she
suddenly
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
whispered
to
him
:
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Louis
,
Louis
!
<EOS>
how
I
wish
I
could
teach
you
to
see
Charles
with
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
felt
her
tears
on
his
cheek
as
she
spoke
,
and
tried
to
reassure
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
teach
me
,
<EOS>
Rose
 
<EOS>
you
shall
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
Come
,
come
,
we
must
keep
up
our
spirits
,
or
how
are
you
to
look
your
best
to
-
morrow
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
unclasped
her
arms
,
and
led
her
gently
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
Rose
's
maid
appeared
,
anxious
to
consult
her
mistress
on
some
of
the
preparations
for
the
wedding
ceremony
.
<EOS>
No
interruption
could
have
been
more
welcome
just
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
It
obliged
Rose
to
think
of
present
trifles
,
and
it
gave
her
brother
an
excuse
for
retiring
to
his
study
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
by
his
desk
,
doubting
and
heavy
-
hearted
,
and
placed
the
letter
from
the
Academy
of
Sciences
open
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
Passing
over
all
the
complimentary
expressions
which
it
contained
,
his
eye
rested
only
on
these
lines
at
the
end
:
"
During
the
first
three
years
of
your
professorship
,
you
will
be
required
to
reside
in
or
near
Paris
nine
months
out
of
the
year
,
for
the
purpose
of
delivering
lectures
and
superintending
experiments
from
time
to
time
in
the
laboratories
.
<EOS>
"
The
letter
in
which
these
lines
occurred
offered
him
such
a
position
as
in
his
modest
self
-
distrust
he
had
never
dreamed
of
before
;
the
lines
themselves
contained
the
promise
of
such
vast
facilities
for
carrying
on
his
favorite
experiments
as
he
could
never
hope
to
command
in
his
own
little
study
,
with
his
own
limited
means
;
and
yet
,
there
he
now
sat
doubting
whether
he
should
accept
or
reject
the
tempting
honors
and
advantages
that
were
offered
to
him
 
doubting
for
his
sister
's
sake
!
  
<EOS>
"
Nine
months
of
the
year
in
Paris
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
sadly
;
"
and
Rose
is
to
pass
her
married
life
at
Lyons
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
could
clear
my
heart
of
its
dread
on
her
account
 
if
I
could
free
my
mind
of
its
forebodings
for
her
future
 
<EOS>
how
gladly
I
would
answer
this
letter
by
accepting
the
trust
it
offers
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
reflected
.
<EOS>
The
thoughts
that
were
in
him
marked
their
ominous
course
in
the
growing
paleness
of
his
cheek
,
in
the
dimness
that
stole
over
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
If
this
cleaving
distrust
from
which
I
can
not
free
myself
should
be
in
very
truth
the
mute
prophecy
of
evil
to
come
 
to
come
,
I
know
not
when
 
if
it
be
so
(
which
God
forbid
!
)
,
how
soon
she
may
want
a
friend
,
a
protector
near
at
hand
,
a
ready
refuge
in
the
time
of
her
trouble
!
<EOS>
Where
shall
she
then
find
protection
or
refuge
?
<EOS>
With
that
passionate
woman
?
<EOS>
With
her
husband
's
kindred
and
friends
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
shuddered
as
the
thought
crossed
his
mind
,
and
opening
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
,
dipped
his
pen
in
the
ink
.
<EOS>
"
Be
all
to
her
,
Louis
,
that
I
have
been
,
"
he
murmured
to
himself
,
repeating
his
mother
's
last
words
,
and
beginning
the
letter
while
he
uttered
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
completed
.
<EOS>
It
expressed
in
the
most
respectful
terms
his
gratitude
for
the
offer
made
to
him
,
and
his
inability
to
accept
it
,
in
consequence
of
domestic
circumstances
which
it
was
needless
to
explain
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
directed
,
sealed
;
it
only
remained
for
him
to
place
it
in
the
post
-
bag
,
lying
near
at
hand
.
<EOS>
At
this
last
decisive
act
he
hesitated
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
Lomaque
,
and
he
had
firmly
believed
himself
,
that
he
had
conquered
all
ambitions
for
his
sister
's
sake
.
<EOS>
He
knew
now
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
had
only
lulled
them
to
rest
 
<EOS>
he
knew
that
the
letter
from
Paris
had
aroused
them
.
<EOS>
His
answer
was
written
,
his
hand
was
on
the
post
-
bag
,
and
at
that
moment
the
whole
struggle
had
to
be
risked
over
again
 
risked
when
he
was
most
unfit
for
it
!
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
man
under
any
ordinary
circumstances
to
procrastinate
,
but
he
procrastinated
now
.
  
<EOS>
"
Night
brings
counsel
;
I
will
wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
and
put
the
letter
of
refusal
in
his
pocket
,
and
hastily
quitted
the
laboratory
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
Inexorably
the
important
morrow
came
:
irretrievably
,
for
good
or
for
evil
,
the
momentous
marriage
-
vow
was
pronounced
.
<EOS>
Charles
Danville
and
Rose
Trudaine
were
now
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
The
prophecy
of
the
magnificent
sunset
overnight
had
not
proved
false
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
cloudless
day
on
the
marriage
morning
.
<EOS>
The
nuptial
ceremonies
had
proceeded
smoothly
throughout
,
and
had
even
satisfied
Madame
Danville
.
<EOS>
She
returned
with
the
wedding
-
party
to
Trudaine
's
house
,
all
smiles
and
serenity
.
<EOS>
To
the
bride
she
was
graciousness
itself
.
"
<EOS>
Good
girl
,
"
said
the
old
lady
,
following
Rose
into
a
corner
,
and
patting
her
approvingly
on
the
cheek
with
her
fan
;
"
good
girl
,
you
have
looked
well
this
morning
 
you
have
done
credit
to
my
son
's
taste
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
you
have
pleased
me
,
child
!
<EOS>
Now
go
upstairs
,
and
get
on
your
traveling
-
dress
,
and
count
on
my
maternal
affection
as
long
as
you
make
Charles
happy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
should
pass
their
honeymoon
in
Brittany
,
and
then
return
to
Danville
's
estate
near
Lyons
.
<EOS>
The
parting
was
hurried
over
,
as
all
such
partings
should
be
.
<EOS>
The
carriage
had
driven
off
;
Trudaine
,
after
lingering
long
to
look
after
it
,
had
returned
hastily
to
the
house
;
the
very
dust
of
the
whirling
wheels
had
all
dispersed
;
there
was
absolutely
nothing
to
see
;
and
yet
there
stood
Monsieur
Lomaque
at
the
outer
gate
;
idly
,
as
if
he
was
an
independent
man
 
calmly
,
as
if
no
such
responsibilities
as
the
calling
of
Madame
Danville
's
coach
,
and
the
escorting
of
Madame
Danville
back
to
Lyons
,
could
possibly
rest
on
his
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
Idly
and
calmly
,
slowly
rubbing
his
hands
one
over
the
other
,
slowly
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
by
which
the
bride
and
bridegroom
had
departed
,
stood
the
eccentric
land
-
steward
at
the
outer
gate
.
<EOS>
On
a
sudden
the
sound
of
footsteps
approaching
from
the
house
seemed
to
arouse
him
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
looked
out
into
the
road
,
as
if
he
expected
still
to
see
the
carriage
of
the
newly
-
married
couple
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
girl
!
<EOS>
ah
,
poor
girl
!
"
said
Monsieur
Lomaque
softly
to
himself
,
turning
round
to
ascertain
who
was
coming
from
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
only
the
postman
with
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
and
the
post
-
bag
crumpled
up
under
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
fresh
news
from
Paris
,
friend
?
"
asked
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
Very
bad
,
monsieur
,
"
answered
the
postman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Camille
Desmoulins
has
appealed
to
the
people
in
the
Palais
Royal
;
there
are
fears
of
a
riot
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
riot
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Lomaque
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
brave
Government
not
to
be
afraid
of
anything
worse
!
<EOS>
Any
letters
?
"
he
added
,
hastily
dropping
the
subject
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
to
the
house
,
"
said
the
postman
,
"
only
one
from
it
,
given
me
by
Monsieur
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
Hardly
worth
while
,
"
he
added
,
twirling
the
letter
in
his
hand
,
"
to
put
it
into
the
bag
,
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
looked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
spoke
,
and
saw
that
the
letter
was
directed
to
the
President
of
the
Academy
of
Sciences
,
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
he
accepts
the
place
or
refuses
it
?
"
<EOS>
thought
the
land
-
steward
,
nodding
to
the
postman
,
and
continuing
on
his
way
back
to
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
door
he
met
Trudaine
,
who
said
to
him
,
rather
hastily
,
"
You
are
going
back
to
Lyons
with
Madame
Danville
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
very
day
,
"
answered
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
you
should
hear
of
a
convenient
bachelor
lodging
,
at
Lyons
,
or
near
it
,
"
continued
the
other
,
dropping
his
voice
and
speaking
more
rapidly
than
before
,
"
you
would
be
doing
me
a
favor
if
you
would
let
me
know
about
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
assented
;
but
before
he
could
add
a
question
which
was
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
,
Trudaine
had
vanished
in
the
interior
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
bachelor
lodging
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
land
-
steward
,
standing
alone
on
the
doorstep
.
<EOS>
"
At
or
near
Lyons
!
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
Monsieur
Trudaine
,
I
put
your
bachelor
lodging
and
your
talk
to
me
last
night
together
,
and
I
make
out
a
sum
total
which
is
,
I
think
,
pretty
near
the
mark
.
<EOS>
You
have
refused
that
Paris
appointment
,
my
friend
;
and
I
fancy
I
can
guess
why
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
thoughtfully
,
and
shook
his
head
with
ominous
frowns
and
bitings
of
his
lips
.
  
<EOS>
"
All
clear
enough
in
that
sky
,
"
he
continued
,
after
a
while
,
looking
up
at
the
lustrous
midday
heaven
.
<EOS>
"
All
clear
enough
there
;
but
I
think
I
see
a
little
cloud
rising
in
a
certain
household
firmament
already
 
a
little
cloud
which
hides
much
,
and
which
I
for
one
shall
watch
carefully
.
"
  
PART
SECOND
.
 
<EOS>
CHAPTER
I.
  
Five
years
have
elapsed
since
Monsieur
Lomaque
stood
thoughtfully
at
the
gate
of
Trudaine
's
house
,
looking
after
the
carriage
of
the
bride
and
bridegroom
,
and
seriously
reflecting
on
the
events
of
the
future
.
<EOS>
Great
changes
have
passed
over
that
domestic
firmament
in
which
he
prophetically
discerned
the
little
warning
cloud
.
<EOS>
Greater
changes
have
passed
over
the
firmament
of
France
.
  
<EOS>
What
was
revolt
five
years
ago
is
Revolution
now
 
revolution
which
has
ingulfed
thrones
,
and
principalities
,
and
powers
;
which
has
set
up
crownless
,
inhereditary
kings
and
counselors
of
its
own
,
and
has
bloodily
torn
them
down
again
by
dozens
;
which
has
raged
and
raged
on
unrestrainedly
in
fierce
earnest
,
until
but
one
king
can
still
govern
and
control
it
for
a
little
while
.
<EOS>
That
king
is
named
Terror
,
and
seventeen
hundred
and
ninety
-
four
is
the
year
of
his
reign
.
  
<EOS>
Monsieur
Lomaque
,
land
-
steward
no
longer
,
sits
alone
in
an
official
-
looking
room
in
one
of
the
official
buildings
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
It
is
another
July
evening
,
as
fine
as
that
evening
when
he
and
Trudaine
sat
talking
together
on
the
bench
overlooking
the
Seine
.
<EOS>
The
window
of
the
room
is
wide
open
,
and
a
faint
,
pleasant
breeze
is
beginning
to
flow
through
it
.
<EOS>
But
Lomaque
breathes
uneasily
,
as
if
still
oppressed
by
the
sultry
midday
heat
;
and
there
are
signs
of
perplexity
and
trouble
in
his
face
as
he
looks
down
absently
now
and
then
into
the
street
.
  
<EOS>
The
times
he
lives
in
are
enough
of
themselves
to
sadden
any
man
's
face
.
<EOS>
In
the
Reign
of
Terror
no
living
being
in
all
the
city
of
Paris
can
rise
in
the
morning
and
be
certain
of
escaping
the
spy
,
the
denunciation
,
the
arrest
,
or
the
guillotine
,
before
night
.
<EOS>
Such
times
are
trying
enough
to
oppress
any
man
's
spirits
;
but
Lomaque
is
not
thinking
of
them
or
caring
for
them
now
.
<EOS>
Out
of
a
mass
of
papers
which
lie
before
him
on
his
old

table
,
he
has
just
taken
up
and
read
one
,
which
has
carried
his
thoughts
back
to
the
past
,
and
to
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
since
he
stood
alone
on
the
doorstep
of
Trudaine
's
house
,
pondering
on
what
might
happen
.
  
<EOS>
More
rapidly
even
than
he
had
foreboded
those
changes
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
In
less
time
even
than
he
had
anticipated
,
the
sad
emergency
for
which
Rose
's
brother
had
prepared
,
as
for
a
barely
possible
calamity
,
overtook
Trudaine
,
and
called
for
all
the
patience
,
the
courage
,
the
self
-
sacrifice
which
he
had
to
give
for
his
sister
's
sake
.
<EOS>
By
slow
gradations
downward
,
from
bad
to
worse
,
her
husband
's
character
manifested
itself
less
and
less
disguisedly
almost
day
by
day
.
<EOS>
Occasional
slights
,
ending
in
habitual
neglect
;
careless
estrangement
,
turning
to
cool
enmity
;
small
insults
,
which
ripened
evilly
to
great
injuries
 
these
were
the
pitiless
signs
which
showed
her
that
she
had
risked
all
and
lost
all
while
still
a
young
woman
 
<EOS>
these
were
the
unmerited
afflictions
which
found
her
helpless
,
and
would
have
left
her
helpless
,
but
for
the
ever
-
present
comfort
and
support
of
her
brother
's
self
-
denying
love
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
,
Trudaine
had
devoted
himself
to
meet
such
trials
as
now
assailed
him
;
and
like
a
man
he
met
them
,
in
defiance
alike
of
persecution
from
the
mother
and
of
insult
from
the
son
.
  
<EOS>
The
hard
task
was
only
lightened
when
,
as
time
advanced
,
public
trouble
began
to
mingle
itself
with
private
grief
.
<EOS>
Then
absorbing
political
necessities
came
as
a
relief
to
domestic
misery
.
<EOS>
Then
it
grew
to
be
the
one
purpose
and
pursuit
of
Danville
's
life
cunningly
to
shape
his
course
so
that
he
might
move
safely
onward
with
the
advancing
revolutionary
tide
 
<EOS>
he
cared
not
whither
,
as
long
as
he
kept
his
possessions
safe
and
his
life
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
His
mother
,
inflexibly
true
to
her
Old
-
World
convictions
through
all
peril
,
might
entreat
and
upbraid
,
might
talk
of
honor
,
and
courage
,
and
sincerity
 
he
heeded
her
not
,
or
heeded
only
to
laugh
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
taken
the
false
way
with
his
wife
,
so
he
was
now
bent
on
taking
it
with
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
The
years
passed
on
;
destroying
changes
swept
hurricane
-
like
over
the
old
governing
system
of
France
;
and
still
Danville
shifted
successfully
with
the
shifting
times
.
<EOS>
The
first
days
of
the
Terror
approached
;
in
public
and
in
private
 
in
high
places
and
in
low
 
each
man
now
suspected
his
brother
.
<EOS>
Crafty
as
Danville
was
,
even
he
fell
under
suspicion
at
last
,
at
headquarters
in
Paris
,
principally
on
his
mother
's
account
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
first
political
failure
;
and
,
in
a
moment
of
thoughtless
rage
and
disappointment
,
he
wreaked
the
irritation
caused
by
it
on
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
Suspected
himself
,
he
in
turn
suspected
the
land
-
steward
.
<EOS>
His
mother
fomented
the
suspicion
 
Lomaque
was
dismissed
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
old
times
the
victim
would
have
been
ruined
,
in
the
new
times
he
was
simply
rendered
eligible
for
a
political
vocation
in
life
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
was
poor
,
quick
-
witted
,
secret
,
not
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
good
patriot
;
he
had
good
patriot
friends
,
plenty
of
ambition
,
a
subtle
,
cat
-
like
courage
,
nothing
to
dread
 
<EOS>
and
he
went
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
There
were
plenty
of
small
chances
there
for
men
of
his
caliber
.
<EOS>
He
waited
for
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
came
;
he
made
the
most
of
it
;
attracted
favorably
the
notice
of
the
terrible
Fouquier
-
Tinville
;
and
won
his
way
to
a
place
in
the
office
of
the
Secret
Police
.
  
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Danville
's
anger
cooled
down
;
he
recovered
the
use
of
that
cunning
sense
which
had
hitherto
served
him
well
,
and
sent
to
recall
the
discarded
servant
.
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
was
already
in
a
position
to
set
him
at
defiance
 
nay
,
to
put
his
neck
,
perhaps
,
under
the
blade
of
the
guillotine
.
<EOS>
Worse
than
this
,
anonymous
letters
reached
him
,
warning
him
to
lose
no
time
in
proving
his
patriotism
by
some
indisputable
sacrifice
,
and
in
silencing
his
mother
,
whose
imprudent
sincerity
was
likely
ere
long
to
cost
her
her
life
.
<EOS>
Danville
knew
her
well
enough
to
know
that
there
was
but
one
way
of
saving
her
,
and
thereby
saving
himself
.
<EOS>
She
had
always
refused
to
emigrate
;
but
he
now
insisted
that
she
should
seize
the
first
opportunity
he
could
procure
for
her
of
quitting
France
until
calmer
times
arrived
.
  
<EOS>
Probably
she
would
have
risked
her
own
life
ten
times
over
rather
than
have
obeyed
him
;
but
she
had
not
the
courage
to
risk
her
son
's
too
;
and
she
yielded
for
his
sake
.
<EOS>
Partly
by
secret
influence
,
partly
by
unblushing
fraud
,
Danville
procured
for
her
such
papers
and
permits
as
would
enable
her
to
leave
France
by
way
of
Marseilles
.
<EOS>
Even
then
she
refused
to
depart
,
until
she
knew
what
her
son
's
plans
were
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
He
showed
her
a
letter
which
he
was
about
to
dispatch
to
Robespierre
himself
,
vindicating
his
suspected
patriotism
,
and
indignantly
demanding
to
be
allowed
to
prove
it
by
filling
some
office
,
no
matter
how
small
,
under
the
redoubtable
triumvirate
which
then
governed
,
or
more
properly
terrified
,
France
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
this
document
reassured
Madame
Danville
.
<EOS>
She
bade
her
son
farewell
,
and
departed
at
last
,
with
one
trusty
servant
,
for
Marseilles
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
's
intention
,
in
sending
his
letter
to
Paris
,
had
been
simply
to
save
himself
by
patriotic
bluster
.
<EOS>
He
was
thunderstruck
at
receiving
a
reply
,
taking
him
at
his
word
,
and
summoning
him
to
the
capital
to
accept
employment
there
under
the
then
existing
Government
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
choice
but
to
obey
.
<EOS>
So
to
Paris
he
journeyed
,
taking
his
wife
with
him
into
the
very
jaws
of
danger
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
at
open
enmity
with
Trudaine
;
and
the
more
anxious
and
alarmed
<EOS>
he
could
make
the
brother
feel
on
the
sister
's
account
,
the
better
he
was
pleased
.
<EOS>
True
to
his
trust
and
his
love
,
through
all
dangers
as
through
all
persecutions
,
Trudaine
followed
them
;
and
the
street
of
their
sojourn
at
Paris
,
in
the
perilous
days
of
the
Terror
,
was
the
street
of
his
sojourn
too
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
had
been
astonished
at
the
acceptance
of
his
proffered
services
;
he
was
still
more
amazed
when
he
found
that
the
post
selected
for
him
was
one
of
the
superintendent
's
places
in
that
very
office
of
Secret
Police
in
which
Lomaque
was
employed
as
agent
.
<EOS>
Robespierre
and
his
colleagues
had
taken
the
measure
of
their
man
 
<EOS>
he
had
money
enough
,
and
local
importance
enough
to
be
worth
studying
.
<EOS>
They
knew
where
he
was
to
be
distrusted
,
and
how
he
might
be
made
useful
.
<EOS>
The
affairs
of
the
Secret
Police
were
the
sort
of
affairs
which
an
unscrupulously
cunning
man
was
fitted
to
help
on
;
and
the
faithful
exercise
of
that
cunning
in
the
service
of
the
State
was
insured
by
the
presence
of
Lomaque
in
the
office
.
<EOS>
The
discarded
servant
was
just
the
right
sort
of
spy
to
watch
the
suspected
master
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
that
,
in
the
office
of
the
Secret
Police
at
Paris
,
and
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
,
Lomaque
's
old
master
was
,
nominally
,
his
master
still
 
the
superintendent
to
whom
he
was
ceremonially
accountable
,
in
public
 
<EOS>
the
suspected
man
,
whose
slightest
words
and
deeds
he
was
officially
set
to
watch
,
in
private
.
  
<EOS>
Ever
sadder
and
darker
grew
the
face
of
Lomaque
as
he
now
pondered
alone
over
the
changes
and
misfortunes
of
the
past
five
years
.
<EOS>
A
neighboring
church
-
clock
striking
the
hour
of
seven
aroused
him
from
his
meditations
.
<EOS>
He
arranged
the
confused
mass
of
papers
before
him
 
looked
toward
the
door
,
as
if
expecting
some
one
to
enter
 
then
,
finding
himself
still
alone
,
recurred
to
the
one
special
paper
which
had
first
suggested
his
long
train
of
gloomy
thoughts
.
<EOS>
The
few
lines
it
contained
were
signed
in
cipher
,
and
ran
thus
:
  
"
You
are
aware
that
your
superintendent
,
Danville
,
obtained
leave
of
absence
last
week
to
attend
to
some
affairs
of
his
at
Lyons
,
and
that
he
is
not
expected
back
just
yet
for
a
day
or
two
.
<EOS>
While
he
is
away
,
push
on
the
affair
of
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
Collect
all
the
evidence
,
and
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
act
on
it
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
leave
the
office
till
you
have
heard
from
me
again
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
a
copy
of
the
Private
Instructions
respecting
Danville
,
which
you
wrote
for
me
,
send
it
to
my
house
.
<EOS>
I
 
wish
to
refresh
my
memory
.
<EOS>
Your
original
letter
is
burned
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
note
abruptly
terminated
.
<EOS>
As
he
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
Lomaque
sighed
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
very
rare
expression
of
feeling
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
leaned
back
in
his
chair
,
and
beat
his
nails
impatiently
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
there
was
a
faint
little
tap
at
the
room
door
,
and
eight
or
ten
men
 
evidently
familiars
of
the
new
French
Inquisition
 
quietly
entered
,
and
ranged
themselves
against
the
wall
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
nodded
to
two
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
Picard
and
Magloire
,
go
and
sit
down
at
that
desk
.
<EOS>
I
shall
want
you
after
the
rest
are
gone
.
"
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
Lomaque
handed
certain
sealed
and
docketed
papers
to
the
other
men
waiting
in
the
room
,
who
received
them
in
silence
,
bowed
,
and
went
out
.
<EOS>
Innocent
spectators
might
have
thought
them
clerks
taking
bills
of
lading
from
a
merchant
.
<EOS>
Who
could
have
imagined
that
the
giving
and
receiving
of
Denunciations
,
Arrest
-
orders
,
and
Death
-
warrants
 
<EOS>
the
providing
of
its
doomed
human
meal
for
the
all
-
devouring
guillotine
 
could
have
been
managed
so
coolly
and
quietly
,
with
such
unruffled
calmness
of
official
routine
?
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
turning
to
the
two
men
at
the
desk
,
as
the
door
closed
,
"
have
you
got
those
notes
about
you
?
"
<EOS>
(
They
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
)
<EOS>
"
Picard
,
you
have
the
first
particulars
of
this
affair
of
Trudaine
;
so
you
must
begin
reading
.
<EOS>
I
have
sent
in
the
reports
;
but
we
may
as
well
go
over
the
evidence
again
from
the
commencement
,
to
make
sure
that
nothing
has
been
left
out
.
<EOS>
If
any
corrections
are
to
be
made
,
now
is
the
time
to
make
them
.
<EOS>
Read
,
Picard
,
and
lose
as
little
time
as
you
possibly
can
.
"
  
<EOS>
Thus
admonished
,
Picard
drew
some
long
slips
of
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
began
reading
from
them
as
follows
:
  
"
Minutes
of
evidence
collected
concerning
Louis
Trudaine
,
suspected
,
on
the
denunciation
of
Citizen
Superintendent
Danville
,
of
hostility
to
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty
,
and
of
disaffection
to
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
.
<EOS>
(
1
.
)
<EOS>
The
suspected
person
is
placed
under
secret
observation
,
and
these
facts
are
elicited
:
<EOS>
He
is
twice
seen
passing
at
night
from
his
own
house
to
a
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
night
he
carries
with
him
money
 
on
the
second
,
papers
.
<EOS>
He
returns
without
either
.
<EOS>
These
particulars
have
been
obtained
through
a
citizen
engaged
to
help
Trudaine
in
housekeeping
(
one
of
the
sort
called
Servants
in
the
days
of
the
Tyrants
)
.
<EOS>
This
man
is
a
good
patriot
,
who
can
be
trusted
to
watch
Trudaine
's
actions
.
<EOS>
(

.
)
<EOS>
The
inmates
of
the
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
are
numerous
,
and
in
some
cases
not
so
well
known
to
the
Government
as
could
be
wished
.
<EOS>
It
is
found
difficult
to
gain
certain
information
about
the
person
or
persons
visited
by
Trudaine
without
having
recourse
to
an
arrest
.
<EOS>
(
3
.
)
<EOS>
An
arrest
is
thought
premature
at
this
preliminary
stage
of
the
proceedings
,
being
likely
to
stop
the
development
of
conspiracy
,
and
give
warning
to
the
guilty
to
fly
.
<EOS>
Order
thereupon
given
to
watch
and
wait
for
the
present
.
<EOS>
(

.
)
<EOS>
Citizen
Superintendent
Danville
quits
Paris
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
The
office
of
watching
Trudaine
is
then
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
the
undersigned
,
and
is
confided
to
his
comrade
,
Magloire
.
 
<EOS>
Signed

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
read
so
far
,
the
police
agent
placed
his
papers
on
the
writing
-
table
,
waited
a
moment
for
orders
,
and
,
receiving
none
,
went
out
.
<EOS>
No
change
came
over
the
sadness
and
perplexity
of
Lomaque
's
face
.
<EOS>
He
still
beat
his
nails
anxiously
on
the
writing
-
table
,
and
did
not
even
look
at
the
second
agent
as
he
ordered
the
man
to
read
his
report
.
<EOS>
Magloire
produced
some
slips
of
paper
precisely
similar
to
Picard
's
and
read
from
them
in
the
same
rapid
,
business
-
like
,
unmodulated
tones
:
  
"
Affair
of
Trudaine

<EOS>
Minutes
continued
.
<EOS>
Citizen
Agent
Magloire
having
been
appointed
to
continue
the
surveillance
of
Trudaine
,
reports
the
discovery
of
additional
facts
of
importance
.
<EOS>
(

<EOS>
Appearances
make
it
probable
that
Trudaine
meditates
a
third
secret
visit
to
the
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
.
<EOS>
The
proper
measures
are
taken
for
observing
him
closely
,
and
the
result
is
the
implication
of
another
person
discovered
to
be
connected
with
the
supposed
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
This
person
is
the
sister
of
Trudaine

and
the
wife
of

Superintendent
Danville

<EOS>
"
  
"
Poor

lost

<EOS>
ah

poor

muttered
Lomaque
to
himself
,
sighing
again
,
and
shifting
uneasily
from
side
to
side
,
in
his
mangy
old
leathern
armchair
.
<EOS>
Apparently
,
Magloire
was
not
accustomed
to
sighs
,
interruptions
,
and
expressions
of
regret
from
the
usually
imperturbable
chief
agent
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
from
his
papers
with
a
stare
of
wonder
.
"
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Magloire
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lomaque
,
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
irritability
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
the
devil
do
n't
you
go
on
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
All
ready
,
citizen
,
"
returned
Magloire
,
submissively
,
and
proceeded
:
  
"
(

<EOS>
It
is
at
Trudaine
's
house
that
the
woman
Danville
's
connection
with
her
brother
's
secret
designs
is
ascertained
,
through
the
vigilance
of
the
before
-
mentioned
patriot
citizen
.
<EOS>
The
interview
of
the
two
suspected
persons
is
private
;
their
conversation
is
carried
on
in
whispers
.
<EOS>
Little
can
be
overheard
;
but
that
little
suffices
to
prove
that
Trudaine
's
sister
is
perfectly
aware
of
his
intention
to
proceed
for
the
third
time
to
the
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
.
<EOS>
It
is
further
discovered
that
she
awaits
his
return
,
and
that
she
then
goes
back
privately
to
her
own
house
.
<EOS>
(

.
)
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
strictest
measures
are
taken
for
watching
the
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
.
<EOS>
It
is
discovered
that
Trudaine
's
visits
are
paid
to
a
man
and
woman
known
to
the
landlord
and
lodgers
by
the
name
of
Dubois
.
<EOS>
They
live
on
the
fourth
floor
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
,
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
,
to
enter
this
room
,
or
to
see
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Dubois
,
without
producing
an
undesirable
disturbance
in
the
house
and
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
A
police
agent
is
left
to
watch
the
place
,
while
search
and
arrest
orders
are
applied
for
.
<EOS>
The
granting
of
these
is
accidentally
delayed
.
<EOS>
When
they
are
ultimately
obtained
,
it
is
discovered
that
the
man
and
the
woman
are
both
missing
.
<EOS>
They
have
not
hitherto
been
traced
.
<EOS>
(
4
.
)
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
house
is
immediately
arrested
,
as
well
as
the
police
agent
appointed
to
watch
the
premises
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
protests
that
he
knows
nothing
of
his
tenants
.
<EOS>
It
is
suspected
,
however
,
that
he
has
been
tampered
with
,
as
also
that
Trudaine
's
papers
,
delivered
to
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Dubois
,
are
forged
passports
.
<EOS>
With
these
and
with
money
,
it
may
not
be
impossible
that
they
have
already
succeeded
in
escaping
from
France
.
<EOS>
The
proper
measures
have
been
taken
for
stopping
them
,
if
they
have
not
yet
passed
the
frontiers
.
<EOS>
No
further
report
in
relation
to
them
has
yet
been
received
(

.
)
<EOS>
Trudaine
and
his
sister
are
under
perpetual
surveillance
,
and
the
undersigned
holds
himself
ready
for
further
orders
.
 
<EOS>
Signed
,
MAGLOIRE
.
<EOS>
Countersigned
,
LOMAQUE
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Having
finished
reading
his
notes
,
Magloire
placed
them
on
the
writing
-
table
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidently
a
favored
man
in
the
office
,
and
he
presumed
upon
his
position
;
for
he
ventured
to
make
a
remark
,
instead
of
leaving
the
room
in
silence
,
like
his
predecessor
Picard
.
  
<EOS>
"
When
Citizen
Danville
returns
to
Paris
,
"
he
began
,
"
he
will
be
rather
astonished
to
find
that
in
denouncing
his
wife
's
brother
he
had
also
unconsciously
denounced
his
wife
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
looked
up
quickly
,
with
that
old
weakness
in
his
eyes
which
affected
them
in
such
a
strangely
irregular
manner
on
certain
occasions
.
<EOS>
Magloire
knew
what
this
symptom
meant
,
and
would
have
become
confused
if
he
had
not
been
a
police
agent
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
he
quietly
backed
a
step
or
two
from
the
table
,
and
held
his
tongue
.
  
<EOS>
"
Friend
Magloire
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
winking
mildly
,
"
your
last
remark
looks
to
me
like
a
question
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
I
put
questions
constantly
to
others
;
I
never
answer
questions
myself
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
know
,
citizen
,
what
our
superintendent
's
secret
motive
is
for
denouncing
his
wife
's
brother
?
<EOS>
Suppose
you
try
and
find
that
out
for
yourself
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
famous
practice
for
you
,
friend
Magloire
 
famous
practice
after
office
hours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
further
orders
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Magloire
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
None
in
relation
to
the
reports
,
"
returned
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
I
find
nothing
to
alter
or
add
on
a
revised
hearing
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
have
a
little
note
ready
for
you
immediately
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
at
the
other
desk
,
friend
Magloire
;
I
am
very
fond
of
you
when
you
are
not
inquisitive
;
pray
sit
down
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
addressing
this
polite
invitation
to
the
agent
in
his
softest
voice
,
Lomaque
produced
his
pocketbook
,
and
drew
from
it
a
little
note
,
which
he
opened
and
read
through
attentively
.
<EOS>
It
was
headed
:
"
<EOS>
Private
Instructions
relative
to
Superintendent
Danville
,
"
and
proceeded
thus
:
  
<EOS>
"
The
undersigned
can
confidently
assert
,
from
long
domestic
experience
in
Danville
's
household
that
his
motive
for
denouncing
his
wife
's
brother
is
purely
a
personal
one
,
and
is
not
in
the
most
remote
degree
connected
with
politics
.
<EOS>
Briefly
,
the
facts
are
these
:
Louis
Trudaine
,
from
the
first
,
opposed
his
sister
's
marriage
with
Danville
,
distrusting
the
latter
's
temper
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
,
however
,
took
place
,
and
the
brother
resigned
himself
to
await
results
 
taking
the
precaution
of
living
in
the
same
neighborhood
as
his
sister
,
to
interpose
,
if
need
be
,
between
the
crimes
which
the
husband
might
commit
and
the
sufferings
which
the
wife
might
endure
.
<EOS>
The
results
soon
exceeded
his
worst
anticipations
,
and
called
for
the
interposition
for
which
he
had
prepared
himself
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
man
of
inflexible
firmness
,
patience
,
and
integrity
,
and
he
makes
the
protection
and
consolation
of
his
sister
the
business
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
gives
his
brother
-
in
-
law
no
pretext
for
openly
quarreling
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
neither
to
be
deceived
,
irritated
,
nor
tired
out
,
and
he
is
Danville
's
superior
every
way
 
in
conduct
,
temper
,
and
capacity
.
<EOS>
Under
these
circumstances
,
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
enmity
toward
him
is
of
the
most
implacable
kind
,
and
equally
unnecessary
to
hint
at
the
perfectly
plain
motive
of
the
denunciation
.
  
<EOS>
"
As
to
the
suspicious
circumstances
affecting
not
Trudaine
only
,
but
his
sister
as
well
,
the
undersigned
regrets
his
inability
,
thus
far
,
to
offer
either
explanation
or
suggestion
.
<EOS>
At
this
preliminary
stage
,
the
affair
seems
involved
in
impenetrable
mystery
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
read
these
lines
through
,
down
to
his
own
signature
at
the
end
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
duplicate
Secret
Instructions
demanded
from
him
in
the
paper
which
he
had
been
looking
over
before
the
entrance
of
the
two
police
agents
.
<EOS>
Slowly
,
and
,
as
it
seemed
,
unwillingly
,
he
folded
the
note
up
in
a
fresh
sheet
of
paper
,
and
was
preparing
to
seal
it
when
a
tap
at
the
door
stopped
him
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
"
he
cried
,
irritably
;
and
a
man
in
traveling
costume
,
covered
with
dust
,
entered
,
quietly
whispered
a
word
or
two
in
his
ear
,
and
then
went
out
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
started
at
the
whisper
,
and
,
opening
his
note
again
,
hastily
wrote
under
his
signature
:
"
I
have
just
heard
that
Danville
has
hastened
his
return
to
Paris
,
and
may
be
expected
back
to
-
night
.
"
<EOS>
Having
traced
these
lines
,
he
closed
,
sealed
,
and
directed
the
letter
,
and
gave
it
to
Magloire
.
<EOS>
The
police
agent
looked
at
the
address
as
he
left
the
room
;
it
was
"
To
Citizen
Robespierre
,
Rue
Saint
-
Honore
.
"
  
<EOS>
Left
alone
again
,
Lomaque
rose
,
and
walked
restlessly
backward
and
forward
,
biting
his
nails
.
  
<EOS>
"
Danville
comes
back
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
and
the
crisis
comes
with
him
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
a
conspirator
!
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
conspiracy
can
hardly
be
the
answer
to
the
riddle
this
time
.
<EOS>
What
is
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
a
turn
or
two
in
silence
 
then
stopped
at
the
open
window
,
looking
out
on
what
little
glimpse
the
street
afforded
him
of
the
sunset
sky
.
<EOS>
"
This
time
five
years
,
"
he
said
,
"
Trudaine
was
talking
to
me
on
that
bench
overlooking
the
river
;
and
Sister
Rose
was
keeping
poor
hatchet
-
faced
old
Lomaque
's
cup
of
coffee
hot
for
him
!
<EOS>
Now
I
am
officially
bound
to
suspect
them
both
;
perhaps
to
arrest
them
;
perhaps
 
I
wish
this
job
had
fallen
into
other
hands
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
it
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
want
it
at
any
price
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
returned
to
the
writing
-
table
and
sat
down
to
his
papers
,
with
the
dogged
air
of
a
man
determined
to
drive
away
vexing
thoughts
by
dint
of
sheer
hard
work
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
an
hour
he
labored
on
resolutely
,
munching
a
bit
of
dry
bread
from
time
to
time
.
<EOS>
Then
he
paused
a
little
,
and
began
to
think
again
.
<EOS>
Gradually
the
summer
twilight
faded
,
and
the
room
grew
dark
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
we
shall
tide
over
to
-
night
,
after
all
 
who
knows
?
"
said
Lomaque
,
ringing
his
handbell
for
lights
.
<EOS>
They
were
brought
in
,
and
with
them
ominously
returned
the
police
agent
Magloire
with
a
small
sealed
packet
.
<EOS>
It
contained
an
arrest
-
order
and
a
tiny
three
-
cornered
note
,
looking
more
like
a
love
-
letter
,
or
a
lady
's
invitation
to
a
party
,
than
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
opened
the
note
eagerly
and
read
these
lines
neatly
written
,
and
signed
with
Robespierre
's
initials
 
M.
R.
 
formed
elegantly
in
cipher
:
  
"
Arrest
Trudaine
and
his
sister
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
On
second
thoughts
,
I
am
not
sure
,
if
Danville
comes
back
in
time
to
be
present
,
that
it
may
not
be
all
the
better
.
<EOS>
He
is
unprepared
for
his
wife
's
arrest
.
<EOS>
Watch
him
closely
when
it
takes
place
,
and
report
privately
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
he
is
a
vicious
man
;
and
of
all
things
I
abhor
Vice
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
more
work
for
me
to
-
night
?
"
asked
Magloire
,
with
a
yawn
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
an
arrest
,
"
replied
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Collect
our
men
;
and
when
you
're
ready
get
a
coach
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
were
just
going
to
supper
,
"
grumbled
Magloire
to
himself
,
as
he
went
out
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
devil
seize
the
Aristocrats
!
<EOS>
They
're
all
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
to
the
guillotine
that
they
wo
n't
even
give
a
man
time
to
eat
his
victuals
in
peace
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
choice
now
,
"
muttered
Lomaque
,
angrily
thrusting
the
arrest
-
order
and
the
three
-
cornered
note
into
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
father
was
the
saving
of
me
;
he
himself
welcomed
me
like
an
equal
;
his
sister
treated
me
like
a
gentleman
,
as
the
phrase
went
in
those
days
;
and
now
"
  
He
stopped
and
wiped
his
forehead
 
then
unlocked
his
desk
,
produced
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
and
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
the
liquor
,
which
he
drank
by
sips
,
slowly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
whether
other
men
get
softer
-
hearted
as
they
grow
older
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
seem
to
do
so
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
Courage
!
<EOS>
courage
!
<EOS>
what
must
be
,
must
.
<EOS>
If
I
risked
my
head
to
do
it
,
I
could
n't
stop
this
arrest
.
<EOS>
Not
a
man
in
the
office
but
would
be
ready
to
execute
it
,
if
I
was
n't
.
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
rumble
of
carriage
-
wheels
sounded
outside
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
's
the
coach
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lomaque
,
locking
up
the
brandy
-
bottle
,
and
taking
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"
After
all
,
as
this
arrest
is
to
be
made
,
it
's
as
well
for
them
that
I
should
make
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Consoling
himself
as
he
best
could
with
this
reflection
,
Chief
Police
Agent
Lomaque
blew
out
the
candles
,
and
quitted
the
room
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
Ignorant
of
the
change
in
her
husband
's
plans
,
which
was
to
bring
him
back
to
Paris
a
day
before
the
time
that
had
been
fixed
for
his
return
,
Sister
Rose
had
left
her
solitary
home
to
spend
the
evening
with
her
brother
.
<EOS>
They
had
sat
talking
together
long
after
sunset
,
and
had
let
the
darkness
steal
on
them
insensibly
,
as
people
will
who
are
only
occupied
with
quiet
,
familiar
conversation
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
,
by
a
curious
coincidence
,
that
just
as
Lomaque
was
blowing
out
his
candles
at
the
office
<EOS>
Rose
was
lighting
the
reading
-
lamp
at
her
brother
's
lodgings
.
  
<EOS>
Five
years
of
disappointment
and
sorrow
had
sadly
changed
her
to
outward
view
.
<EOS>
Her
face
looked
thinner
and
longer
;
the
once
delicate
red
and
white
of
her
complexion
was
gone
;
her
figure
had
wasted
under
the
influence
of
some
weakness
,
which
had
already
made
her
stoop
a
little
when
she
walked
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
had
lost
its
maiden
shyness
,
only
to
become
unnaturally
quiet
and
subdued
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
charms
which
had
so
fatally
,
yet
so
innocently
,
allured
her
heartless
husband
,
but
one
remained
 
the
winning
gentleness
of
her
voice
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
touched
now
and
then
with
a
note
of
sadness
,
but
the
soft
attraction
of
its
even
,
natural
tone
still
remained
.
<EOS>
In
the
marring
of
all
other
harmonies
,
this
one
harmony
had
been
preserved
unchanged
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
though
his
face
was
careworn
,
and
his
manner
sadder
than
of
old
,
looked
less
altered
from
his
former
self
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
most
fragile
material
which
soonest
shows
the
flaw
.
<EOS>
The
world
's
idol
,
Beauty
,
holds
its
frailest
tenure
of
existence
in
the
one
Temple
where
we
most
love
to
worship
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
so
you
think
,
Louis
,
that
our
perilous
undertaking
has
really
ended
well
by
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
said
Rose
,
anxiously
,
as
she
lighted
the
lamp
and
placed
the
glass
shade
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
relief
it
is
only
to
hear
you
say
you
think
we
have
succeeded
at
last
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
said
I
hope
,
Rose
,
"
replied
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
even
hoped
is
a
great
word
from
you
,
Louis
 
a
great
word
from
any
one
in
this
fearful
city
,
and
in
these
days
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
suddenly
,
seeing
her
brother
raise
his
hand
in
warning
.
<EOS>
They
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
and
listened
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
footsteps
going
slowly
past
the
house
 
ceasing
for
a
moment
just
beyond
it
 
then
going
on
again
 
came
through
the
open
window
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
else
,
out
-
of
-
doors
or
in
,
to
disturb
the
silence
of
the
night
 
the
deadly
silence
of
Terror
which
,
for
months
past
,
had
hung
over
Paris
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
significant
sign
of
the
times
,
that
even
a
passing
footstep
,
sounding
a
little
strangely
at
night
,
was
subject
for
suspicion
,
both
to
brother
and
sister
 
<EOS>
so
common
a
subject
<EOS>
,
that
they
suspended
their
conversation
as
a
matter
of
course
,
without
exchanging
a
word
of
explanation
,
until
the
tramp
of
the
strange
footsteps
had
died
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
,
"
continued
Rose
,
dropping
her
voice
to
a
whisper
,
after
nothing
more
was
audible
,
"
when
may
I
trust
our
secret
to
my
husband
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Not
yet
!
"
rejoined
Trudaine
,
earnestly
.
"
Not
a
word
,
not
a
hint
of
it
,
till
I
give
you
leave
.
<EOS>
Remember
,
Rose
<EOS>
,
you
promised
silence
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Everything
depends
on
your
holding
that
promise
sacred
till
I
release
you
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
hold
it
sacred
;
I
will
indeed
,
at
all
hazards
,
under
all
provocations
,
"
she
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
quite
enough
to
reassure
me
 
and
now
,
love
,
let
us
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Even
these
walls
may
have
ears
,
and
the
closed
door
yonder
may
be
no
protection
.
"
<EOS>
He
looked
toward
it
uneasily
while
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
by
,
I
have
come
round
to
your
way
of
thinking
,
Rose
,
about
that
new
servant
of
mine
 
<EOS>
there
is
something
false
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
been
as
quick
to
detect
it
as
you
were
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rose
glanced
at
him
affrightedly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
done
anything
suspicious
?
<EOS>
Have
you
caught
him
watching
you
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
worst
,
Louis
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
hush
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
not
so
loud
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
alarm
yourself
;
he
has
done
nothing
suspicious
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Turn
him
off
 
pray
,
pray
turn
him
off
,
before
it
is
too
late
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
be
denounced
by
him
,
in
revenge
,
the
first
night
he
goes
to
his
Section
.
<EOS>
You
forget
that
servants
and
masters
are
equal
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
supposed
to
keep
a
servant
at
all
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
citizen
living
with
me
who
lays
me
under
domestic
obligations
,
for
which
I
make
a
pecuniary
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
if
I
do
anything
,
I
must
try
if
I
ca
n't
entrap
him
into
giving
me
warning
.
<EOS>
But
we
have
got
to
another
unpleasant
subject
<EOS>
already
 
suppose
I
change
the
topic
again
?
<EOS>
You
will
find
a
little
book
on
that
table
there
,
in
the
corner
 
tell
me
what
you
think
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
book
was
a
copy
of
Corneille
's
"
Cid
,
"
prettily
bound
in
blue
morocco
.
<EOS>
Rose
was
enthusiastic
in
her
praises
.
<EOS>
"
I
found
it
in
a
bookseller
's
shop
,
yesterday
,
"
said
her
brother
,
"
and
bought
it
as
a
present
for
you
.
<EOS>
Corneille
is
not
an
author
to
compromise
any
one
,
even
in
these
times
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
saying
the
other
day
that
you
felt
ashamed
of
knowing
but
little
of
our
greatest
dramatist
?
"
<EOS>
Rose
remembered
well
,
and
smiled
almost
as
happily
as
in
the
old
times
over
her
present
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
some
good
engravings
at
the
beginning
of
each
act
,
"
continued
Trudaine
,
directing
her
attention
rather
earnestly
to
the
illustrations
,
and
then
suddenly
leaving
her
side
when
he
saw
that
she
became
interested
in
looking
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
window
 
<EOS>
listened
 
then
drew
aside
the
curtain
,
and
looked
up
and
down
the
street
.
<EOS>
No
living
soul
was
in
sight
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
been
mistaken
,
"
he
thought
,
returning
hastily
to
his
sister
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
certainly
fancied
I
was
followed
in
my
walk
to
-
day
by
a
spy
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
wonder
,
"
asked
Rose
,
still
busy
over
her
book
,
"
I
wonder
,
Louis
,
whether
my
husband
would
let
me
go
with
you
to
see
"
Le
Cid
"
<EOS>
the
next
time
it
is
acted
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
"
cried
a
voice
at
the
door
;
"
not
if
you
went
on
your
knees
to
ask
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rose
turned
round
with
a
scream
.
<EOS>
There
stood
her
husband
on
the
threshold
,
scowling
at
her
,
with
his
hat
on
,
and
his
hands
thrust
doggedly
into
his
pockets
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
's
servant
announced
him
,
with
an
insolent
smile
,
during
the
pause
that
followed
the
discovery
.
"
<EOS>
Citizen
Superintendent
Danville
,
to
visit
the
citoyenne
,
his
wife
,
"
said
the
fellow
,
making
a
mock
bow
to
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
Rose
looked
at
her
brother
,
then
advanced
a
few
paces
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
a
surprise
,
"
she
said
,
faintly
;
"
has
anything
happened
?
<EOS>
We
 
<EOS>
we
did
n't
expect
you
.
"
<EOS>
Her
voice
failed
her
as
she
saw
her
husband
advancing
,
pale
to
his
very
lips
with
suppressed
anger
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
dare
you
come
here
,
after
what
I
told
you
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
in
quick
,
low
tones
.
  
<EOS>
She
shrank
at
his
voice
almost
as
if
he
had
struck
her
.
<EOS>
The
blood
flew
into
her
brother
's
face
as
he
noticed
the
action
;
but
he
controlled
himself
,
and
,
taking
her
hand
,
led
her
in
silence
to
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
forbid
you
to
sit
down
in
his
house
,
"
said
Danville
,
advancing
still
<EOS>
;
"
I
order
you
to
come
back
with
me
!
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
?
<EOS>
I
order
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
was
approaching
nearer
to
her
,
when
he
caught
Trudaine
's
eye
fixed
on
him
,
and
stopped
.
<EOS>
Rose
started
up
,
and
placed
herself
between
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Charles
,
Charles
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
to
her
husband
,
"
be
friends
with
Louis
to
-
night
,
and
be
kind
again
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
claim
to
ask
that
much
of
you
,
though
you
may
not
think
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
away
from
her
,
and
laughed
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
speak
again
,
but
Trudaine
touched
her
on
the
arm
,
and
gave
her
a
warning
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
Signals
!
"
exclaimed
Danville
;
"
secret
signals
between
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
eye
,
as
he
glanced
suspiciously
at
his
wife
,
fell
on
Trudaine
's
gift
-
book
,
which
she
still
held
unconsciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
book
is
that
?
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
a
play
of
Corneille
's
,
"
answered
Rose
;
"
Louis
has
just
made
me
a
present
of
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
avowal
Danville
's
suppressed
anger
burst
beyond
all
control
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
it
him
back
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
fury
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
no
presents
from
him
;
the
venom
of
the
household
spy
soils
everything
he
touches
.
<EOS>
Give
it
him
back
!
"
<EOS>
She
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"
You
wo
n't
?
"
<EOS>
He
tore
the
book
from
her
with
an
oath
,
threw
it
on
the
floor
,
and
set
his
foot
on
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Louis
!
<EOS>
Louis
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
was
stepping
forward
as
the
book
fell
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
his
sister
threw
her
arms
round
him
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
turning
from
fiery
red
to
ghastly
pale
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Louis
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
clasping
him
closer
;
"
not
after
five
years
'
patience
.
<EOS>
No
 
no
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
gently
detached
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
,
love
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
;
it
is
all
over
now
.
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
that
,
he
put
her
from
him
,
and
in
silence
took
up
the
book
from
the
floor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Wo
n't
that
offend
you
even
?
<EOS>
"
said
Danville
,
with
an
insolent
smile
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
wonderful
temper
 
any
other
man
would
have
called
me
out
!
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
looked
back
at
him
steadily
;
and
taking
out
his
handkerchief
,
passed
it
over
the
soiled
cover
of
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
could
wipe
the
stain
of
your
blood
off
my
conscience
as
easily
as
I
can
wipe
the
stain
of
your
boot
off
this
book
,
"
he
said
quietly
,
"
you
should
not
live
another
hour
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
cry
,
Rose
<EOS>
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
again
to
his
sister
:
"
I
will
take
care
of
your
book
for
you
until
you
can
keep
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
do
this
!
<EOS>
you
will
do
that
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Danville
,
growing
more
and
more
exasperated
,
and
letting
his
anger
got
the
better
even
of
his
cunning
now
.
<EOS>
"
Talk
less
confidently
of
the
future
 
you
do
n't
know
what
it
has
in
store
for
you
.
<EOS>
Govern
your
tongue
when
you
are
in
my
presence
;
a
day
may
come
when
you
will
want
my
help
 
my
help
;
do
you
hear
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
turned
his
face
from
his
sister
,
as
if
he
feared
to
let
her
see
it
when
those
words
were
spoken
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
man
who
followed
me
to
-
day
was
a
spy
 
Danville
's
spy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
thought
flashed
across
his
mind
,
but
he
gave
it
no
utterance
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
instant
's
pause
of
silence
;
and
through
it
there
came
heavily
on
the
still
night
air
the
rumbling
of
distant
wheels
.
<EOS>
The
sound
advanced
nearer
and
nearer
 
advanced
and
ceased
under
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
hurried
to
it
,
and
looked
out
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
hastened
my
return
without
reason
.
<EOS>
I
would
n't
have
missed
this
arrest
for
anything
!
"
<EOS>
thought
he
,
peering
into
the
night
.
  
<EOS>
The
stars
were
out
,
but
there
was
no
moon
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
recognize
either
the
coach
or
the
persons
who
got
out
of
it
,
and
he
turned
again
into
the
interior
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
wife
had
sunk
into
a
chair
,
her
brother
was
locking
up
in
a
cabinet
<EOS>
the
book
which
he
had
promised
to
take
care
of
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
dead
silence
made
the
noise
of
slowly
ascending
footsteps
on
the
stairs
painfully
audible
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
door
opened
softly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Citizen
Danville
,
health
and
fraternity
!
"
said
Lomaque
,
appearing
in
the
doorway
,
followed
by
his
agents
.
"
<EOS>
Citizen
Louis
Trudaine
?
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
beginning
with
the
usual
form
.
  
<EOS>
Rose
started
out
of
her
chair
;
but
her
brother
's
hand
was
on
her
lips
before
she
could
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
name
is
Louis
Trudaine
,
"
he
answered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charles
!
"
cried
his
sister
,
breaking
from
him
and
appealing
to
her
husband
,
"
who
are
these
men
?
<EOS>
What
are
they
here
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
gave
her
no
answer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
Trudaine
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
slowly
,
drawing
the
order
from
his
pocket
,
"
in
the
name
of
the
Republic
,
I
arrest
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
come
back
,
"
cried
Trudaine
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
;
she
had
broken
from
him
,
and
in
the
recklessness
of
terror
,
had
seized
her
husband
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Save
him
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Save
him
,
by
all
you
hold
dearest
in
the
world
!
<EOS>
You
are
that
man
's
superior
,
<EOS>
Charles
 
order
him
from
the
room
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Danville
roughly
shook
her
hand
off
his
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Lomaque
is
doing
his
duty
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
glance
of
malicious
triumph
at
Trudaine
,
"
yes
,
doing
his
duty
.
<EOS>
Look
at
me
as
you
please
 
<EOS>
your
looks
wo
n't
move
me
.
<EOS>
I
denounced
you
!
<EOS>
I
admit
it
 
<EOS>
I
glory
in
it
!
<EOS>
I
have
rid
myself
of
an
enemy
,
and
the
State
of
a
bad
citizen
.
<EOS>
Remember
your
secret
visits
to
the
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
!
"
  
<EOS>
His
wife
uttered
a
cry
of
horror
.
<EOS>
She
seized
his
arm
again
with
both
hands
 
frail
,
trembling
hands
 
<EOS>
that
seemed
suddenly
nerved
with
all
the
strength
of
a
man
's
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
here
 
come
here
!
<EOS>
I
must
and
will
speak
to
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
dragged
him
by
main
force
a
few
paces
back
,
toward
an
unoccupied
corner
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
With
deathly
cheeks
and
wild
eyes
she
raised
herself
on
tiptoe
,
and
put
her
lips
to
her
husband
's
ear
.
<EOS>
At
that
instant
Trudaine
called
to
her
:
  
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
if
you
speak
I
am
lost
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
dropped
her
hold
on
her
husband
's
arm
,
and
faced
her
brother
,
shuddering
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rose
,
"
he
continued
,
"
you
have
promised
,
and
your
promise
is
sacred
.
<EOS>
If
you
prize
your
honor
,
if
you
love
me
,
come
here
 
come
here
,
and
be
silent
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
She
ran
to
him
;
and
,
laying
her
head
on
his
bosom
,
burst
into
a
passion
of
tears
.
  
<EOS>
Danville
turned
uneasily
toward
the
police
agents
.
<EOS>
"
Remove
your
prisoner
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
done
your
duty
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Only
half
of
it
,
"
retorted
Lomaque
,
eying
him
attentively
.
"
<EOS>
Rose
Danville
"
  
"
My
wife
!
"
exclaimed
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
What
about
my
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Rose
Danville
,
"
continued
Lomaque
,
impassibly
,
"
you
are
included
in
the
arrest
of
Louis
Trudaine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rose
raised
her
head
quickly
from
her
brother
's
breast
.
<EOS>
His
firmness
had
deserted
him
 
he
was
trembling
.
<EOS>
She
heard
him
whispering
to
himself
,
"
Rose
,
too
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
God
!
<EOS>
I
was
not
prepared
for
that
.
"
<EOS>
She
heard
these
words
,
and
dashed
the
tears
from
her
eyes
,
and
kissed
him
,
saying
:
  
"
I
am
glad
of
it
,
Louis
.
<EOS>
We
risked
all
together
 
<EOS>
we
shall
now
suffer
together
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Danville
looked
incredulously
at
Lomaque
,
after
the
first
shock
of
astonishment
was
over
.
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
denounced
my
wife
.
<EOS>
There
is
some
mistake
;
you
have
exceeded
your
orders
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Silence
!
"
retorted
Lomaque
,
imperiously
.
"
<EOS>
Silence
,
citizen
,
and
respect
to
a
decree
of
the
Republic
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
blackguard
!
<EOS>
show
me
the
arrest
-
order
!
"
said
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
Who
has
dared
to
denounce
my
wife
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
!
"
said
Lomaque
,
turning
on
him
with
a
grin
of
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
 
and
"
blackguard
"
back
in
your
teeth
!
<EOS>
You
,
in
denouncing
her
brother
!
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
we
work
hard
in
our
office
;
we
do
n't
waste
time
in
calling
names
 
<EOS>
we
make
discoveries
.
<EOS>
If
Trudaine
is
guilty
,
your
wife
is
implicated
in
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
We
know
it
;
and
we
arrest
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
resist
the
arrest
,
"
cried
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
authority
here
.
<EOS>
Who
opposes
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
impassible
chief
agent
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Some
new
noise
in
the
street
struck
his
quick
ear
.
<EOS>
He
ran
to
the
window
and
looked
out
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
opposes
me
?
"
reiterated
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hark
!
"
exclaimed
Lomaque
,
raising
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Silence
,
and
listen
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
heavy
,
dull
tramp
of
men
marching
together
became
audible
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
Voices
humming
low
and
in
unison
the
Marseillaise
hymn
,
joined
solemnly
with
the
heavy
,
regular
footfalls
.
<EOS>
Soon
the
flare
of
torch
-
light
began
to
glimmer
redder
and
redder
under
the
dim
,
starlight
sky
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
?
<EOS>
Do
you
see
the
advancing
torch
-
light
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Lomaque
,
pointing
exultingly
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Respect
to
the
national
hymn
,
and
to
the
man
who
holds
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
the
destinies
of
all
France
!
<EOS>
Hat
off
,
Citizen
Danville
!
<EOS>
Robespierre
is
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
His
bodyguard
,
the
Hard
-
hitters
,
are
lighting
him
on
his
way
to
the
Jacobin
Club
!
<EOS>
Who
shall
oppose
you
,
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
Your
master
and
mine
;
the
man
whose
signature
is
at
the
bottom
of
this
order
 
<EOS>
the
man
who
with
a
scratch
of
his
pen
can
send
both
our
heads
rolling
together
into
the
sack
of
the
guillotine
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
to
him
as
he
passes
the
house
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
tell
him
that
Superintendent
Danville
resists
me
in
making
an
arrest
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
?
"
<EOS>
And
in
the
immensity
of
his
contempt
,
Lomaque
seemed
absolutely
to
rise
in
stature
,
as
he
thrust
the
arrest
order
under
Danville
's
eyes
and
pointed
to
the
signature
with
the
head
of
his
stick
.
  
<EOS>
Rose
looked
round
in
terror
,
as
Lomaque
spoke
his
last
words
 
looked
round
,
and
saw
her
husband
recoil
before
the
signature
on
the
arrest
order
,
as
if
the
guillotine
itself
had
suddenly
arisen
before
him
.
<EOS>
Her
brother
felt
her
shrinking
back
in
his
arms
,
and
trembled
for
the
preservation
of
her
self
-
control
if
the
terror
and
suspense
of
the
arrest
lasted
any
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Courage
,
Rose
,
courage
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
behaved
nobly
;
you
must
not
fail
now
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
Not
a
word
more
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
till
I
am
able
to
think
clearly
again
,
and
to
decide
what
is
best
.
<EOS>
Courage
,
love
;
our
lives
depend
on
it
.
<EOS>
Citizen
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
himself
to
Lomaque
,
"
proceed
with
your
duty
 
<EOS>
we
are
ready
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
heavy
marching
footsteps
outside
were
striking
louder
and
louder
on
the
ground
;
the
chanting
voices
were
every
moment
swelling
in
volume
;
the
dark
street
was
flaming
again
with
the
brightening
torch
-
light
,
as
Lomaque
,
under
pretext
of
giving
Trudaine
his
hat
,
came
close
to
him
,
and
,
turning
his
back
toward
Danville
,
whispered
:
"
<EOS>
I
have
not
forgotten
the
eve
of
the
wedding
and
the
bench
on
the
river
bank
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Trudaine
could
answer
,
he
had
taken
Rose
's
cloak
and
hood
from
one
of
his
assistants
,
and
was
helping
her
on
with
it
.
<EOS>
Danville
,
still
pale
and
trembling
,
advanced
a
step
when
he
saw
these
preparations
for
departure
,
and
addressed
a
word
or
two
to
his
wife
;
but
he
spoke
in
low
tones
,
and
the
fast
-
advancing
march
of
feet
and
sullen
low
roar
of
singing
outside
drowned
his
voice
.
<EOS>
An
oath
burst
from
his
lips
,
and
he
struck
his
fist
,
in
impotent
fury
,
on
a
table
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
seals
are
set
on
everything
in
this
room
and
in
the
bedroom
,
"
said
Magloire
,
approaching
Lomaque
,
who
nodded
and
signed
to
him
to
bring
up
the
other
police
agents
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ready
,
"
cried
Magloire
,
coming
forward
immediately
with
his
men
,
and
raising
his
voice
to
make
himself
heard
.
<EOS>
"
Where
to
?
"
  
<EOS>
Robespierre
and
his
Hard
-
hitters
were
passing
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
smoke
of
the
torch
-
light
was
rolling
in
at
the
window
;
the
tramping
footsteps
struck
heavier
and
heavier
on
the
ground
;
the
low
sullen
roar
of
the
Marseillaise
was
swelling
to
its
loudest
,
as
Lomaque
referred
for
a
moment
to
his
arrest
-
order
,
and
then
answered
:
  
"
To
the
prison
of
St.
Lazare
!
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
head
jailer
of
St.
Lazare
stood
in
the
outer
hall
of
the
prison
,
two
days
after
the
arrest
at
Trudaine
's
lodgings
,
smoking
his
morning
pipe
.
<EOS>
Looking
toward
the
courtyard
gate
,
he
saw
the
wicket
opened
,
and
a
privileged
man
let
in
,
whom
he
soon
recognized
as
the
chief
agent
of
the
second
section
of
Secret
Police
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
,
friend
Lomaque
,
"
cried
the
jailer
,
advancing
toward
the
courtyard
,
"
what
brings
you
here
this
morning
,
business
or
pleasure
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pleasure
,
this
time
,
citizen
.
<EOS>
I
have
an
idle
hour
or
two
to
spare
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
I
find
myself
passing
the
prison
,
and
I
ca
n't
resist
calling
in
to
see
how
my
friend
the
head
jailer
is
getting
on
.
"
<EOS>
Lomaque
spoke
in
a
surprisingly
brisk
and
airy
manner
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
suffering
under
a
violent
fit
of
weakness
and
winking
;
but
he
smiled
,
notwithstanding
,
with
an
air
of
the
most
inveterate
cheerfulness
.
<EOS>
Those
old
enemies
of
his
,
who
always
distrusted
him
most
when
his
eyes
were
most
affected
,
would
have
certainly
disbelieved
every
word
of
the
friendly
speech
he
had
just
made
,
and
would
have
assumed
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
his
visit
to
the
head
jailer
had
some
specially
underhand
business
at
the
bottom
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
am
I
getting
on
?
"
said
the
jailer
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Overworked
,
friend
 
overworked
.
<EOS>
No
idle
hours
in
our
department
.
<EOS>
Even
the
guillotine
is
getting
too
slow
for
us
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Sent
off
your
batch
of
prisoners
for
trial
this
morning
?
"
asked
Lomaque
,
with
an
appearance
of
perfect
unconcern
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
they
're
just
going
,
"
answered
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
have
a
look
at
them
.
"
<EOS>
He
spoke
as
if
the
prisoners
were
a
collection
of
pictures
on
view
,
or
a
set
of
dresses
just
made
up
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
nodded
his
head
,
still
with
his
air
of
happy
,
holiday
carelessness
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
led
the
way
to
an
inner
hall
;
and
,
pointing
lazily
with
his
pipe
-
stem
,
said
:
"
Our
morning
batch
,
citizen
,
just
ready
for
the
baking
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
one
corner
of
the
hall
were
huddled
together
more
than
thirty
men
and
women
of
all
ranks
and
ages
;
some
staring
round
them
with
looks
of
blank
despair
;
some
laughing
and
gossiping
recklessly
.
<EOS>
Near
them
lounged
a
guard
of
"
Patriots
,
"
smoking
,
spitting
,
and
swearing
.
<EOS>
Between
the
patriots
and
the
prisoners
sat
,
on
a
rickety
stool
,
the
second
jailer
 
a
humpbacked
man
,
with
an
immense
red
mustache
 
finishing
his
breakfast
of
broad
beans
,
which
he
scooped
out
of
a
basin
with
his
knife
,
and
washed
down
with
copious
draughts
of
wine
from
a
bottle
.
<EOS>
Carelessly
as
Lomaque
looked
at
the
shocking
scene
before
him
,
his
quick
eyes
contrived
to
take
note
of
every
prisoner
's
face
,
and
to
descry
in
a
few
minutes
Trudaine
and
his
sister
standing
together
at
the
back
of
the
group
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
Apollo
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
head
jailer
,
addressing
his
subordinate
by
a
facetious
prison
nickname
,
"
do
n't
be
all
day
starting
that
trumpery
batch
of
yours
.
<EOS>
And
harkye
,
friend
,
I
have
leave
of
absence
,
on
business
,
at
my
Section
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
So
it
will
be
your
duty
to
read
the
list
for
the
guillotine
,
and
chalk
the
prisoners
'
doors
before
the
cart
comes
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Ware
the
bottle
,
Apollo
,
to
-
day
;
"
ware
the
bottle
,
for
fear
of
accidents
with
the
death
-
list
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thirsty
July
weather
,
this
 
eh
,
citizen
?
"
said
Lomaque
,
leaving
the
head
jailer
,
and
patting
the
hunchback
in
the
friendliest
manner
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
how
you
have
got
your
batch
huddled
up
together
this
morning
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
help
you
to
shove
them
into
marching
order
?
<EOS>
My
time
is
quite
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
holiday
morning
with
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
<EOS>
what
a
jolly
dog
he
is
on
his
holiday
morning
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
head
jailer
,
as
Lomaque
 
apparently
taking
leave
of
his
natural
character
altogether
in
the
exhilaration
of
an
hour
's
unexpected
leisure
 
began
pushing
and
pulling
the
prisoners
into
rank
,
with
humorous
mock
apologies
,
at
which
not
the
officials
only
,
but
many
of
the
victims
themselves
 
reckless
victims
of
a
reckless
tyranny
 
laughed
heartily
.
<EOS>
Persevering
to
the
last
in
his
practical
jest
,
Lomaque
contrived
to
get
close
to
Trudaine
for
a
minute
,
and
to
give
him
one
significant
look
before
he
seized
him
by
the
shoulders
,
like
the
rest
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
rear
-
guard
,
"
cried
Lomaque
,
pushing
Trudaine
on
,
"
close
the
line
of
march
,
and
mind
you
keep
step
with
your
young
woman
there
.
<EOS>
Pluck
up
your
spirits
,
citoyenne
!
<EOS>
one
gets
used
to
everything
in
this
world
,
even
to
the
guillotine
!
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
speaking
and
pushing
at
the
same
time
,
Trudaine
felt
a
piece
of
paper
slip
quickly
between
his
neck
and
his
cravat
.
<EOS>
"
Courage
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
,
pressing
his
sister
's
hand
,
as
he
saw
her
shuddering
under
the
assumed
brutality
of
Lomaque
's
joke
.
  
<EOS>
Surrounded
by
the
guard
of

Patriots
,
"
the
procession
of
prisoners
moved
slowly
into
the
outer
courtyard
,
on
its
way
to
the
revolutionary
tribunal
,
the
humpbacked
jailer
bringing
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
was
about
to
follow
at
some
little
distance
,
but
the
head
jailer
hospitably
expostulated
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
hurry
you
're
in
!
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Now
that
incorrigible
drinker
,
my
second
in
command
,
has
gone
off
with
his
batch
,
I
do
n't
mind
asking
you
to
step
in
and
have
a
drop
of
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
"
answered
Lomaque
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
have
rather
a
fancy
for
hearing
the
trial
this
morning
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
come
back
afterward
?
<EOS>
What
time
do
you
go
to
your
Section
?
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
,
eh
?
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
I
shall
try
if
I
ca
n't
get
here
soon
after
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
nodded
and
went
out
.
<EOS>
The
brilliant
sunlight
in
the
courtyard
made
him
wink
faster
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Had
any
of
his
old
enemies
been
with
him
,
they
would
have
whispered
within
themselves
,
"
If
you
mean
to
come
back
at
all
,
Citizen
Lomaque
,
it
will
not
be
soon
after
one
!
"
  
<EOS>
On
his
way
through
the
streets
,
the
chief
agent
met
one
or
two
police
office
friends
,
who
delayed
his
progress
;
so
that
when
he
arrived
at
the
revolutionary
tribunal
the
trials
of
the
day
were
just
about
to
begin
.
  
<EOS>
The
principal
article
of
furniture
in
the
Hall
of
Justice
was
a
long
,
clumsy
,
deal
table
,
covered
with
green
baize
.
<EOS>
At
the
head
of
this
table
sat
the
president
and
his
court
,
with
their
hats
on
,
backed
by
a
heterogeneous
collection
of
patriots
officially
connected
in
various
ways
with
the
proceedings
that
were
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
Below
the
front
of
the
table
,
a
railed
-
off
space
,
with
a
gallery
beyond
,
was
appropriated
to
the
general
public
 
mostly
represented
,
as
to
the
gallery
,
on
this
occasion
,
by
women
,
all
sitting
together
on
forms
,
knitting
,
shirt
-
mending
,
and
baby
-
linen
-
making
,
as
coolly
as
if
they
were
at
home
.
<EOS>
Parallel
with
the
side
of
the
table
furthest
from
the
great
door
of
entrance
was
a
low
platform
railed
off
,
on
which
the
prisoners
,
surrounded
by
their
guard
,
were
now
assembled
to
await
their
trial
.
<EOS>
The
sun
shone
in
brightly
from
a
high
window
,
and
a
hum
of
ceaseless
talking
pervaded
the
hall
cheerfully
as
Lomaque
entered
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
privileged
man
here
,
as
at
the
prison
;
and
he
made
his
way
in
by
a
private
door
,
so
as
to
pass
to
the
prisoners
'
platform
,
and
to
walk
round
it
,
before
he
got
to
a
place
behind
the
president
's
chair
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
,
standing
with
his
sister
on
the
outermost
limits
of
the
group
,
nodded
significantly
as
Lomaque
looked
up
at
him
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
He
had
contrived
,
on
his
way
to
the
tribunal
,
to
get
an
opportunity
of
reading
the
paper
which
the
chief
agent
had
slipped
into
his
cravat
.
<EOS>
It
contained
these
lines
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
discovered
who
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Dubois
are
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
chance
for
you
but
to
confess
everything
.
<EOS>
By
that
means
you
may
inculpate
a
certain
citizen
holding
authority
,
and
may
make
it
his
interest
,
if
he
loves
his
own
life
,
to
save
yours
and
your
sister
's
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
back
of
the
president
's
chair
,
Lomaque
recognized
his
two
trusty
subordinates
,
Magloire
and
Picard
,
waiting
among
the
assembled
patriot
officials
,
to
give
their
evidence
.
<EOS>
Beyond
them
,
leaning
against
the
wall
,
addressed
by
no
one
,
and
speaking
to
no
one
,
stood
the
superintendent
,
Danville
.
<EOS>
Doubt
and
suspense
were
written
in
every
line
of
his
face
;
the
fretfulness
of
an
uneasy
mind
expressed
itself
in
his
slightest
gesture
 
even
in
his
manner
of
passing
a
handkerchief
from
time
to
time
over
his
face
,
on
which
the
perspiration
was
gathering
thick
and
fast
already
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
cried
the
usher
of
the
court
for
the
time
being
 
a
hoarse
-
voiced
man
in
top
-
boots
with
a
huge
saber
buckled
to
his
side
,
and
a
bludgeon
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Silence
for
the
Citizen
President
!
<EOS>
"
he
reiterated
,
striking
his
bludgeon
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
president
rose
and
proclaimed
that
the
sitting
for
the
day
had
begun
;
then
sat
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
momentary
silence
which
followed
was
interrupted
by
a
sudden
confusion
among
the
prisoners
on
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
guards
sprang
in
among
them
.
<EOS>
There
was
the
thump
of
a
heavy
fall
 
a
scream
of
terror
from
some
of
the
female
prisoners
 
then
another
dead
silence
,
broken
by
one
of
the
guards
,
who
walked
across
the
hall
with
a
bloody
knife
in
his
hand
,
and
laid
it
on
the
table
.
"
<EOS>
Citizen
President
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
have
to
report
that
one
of
the
prisoners
has
just
stabbed
himself
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
murmuring
exclamation
,
"
Is
that
all
?
"
<EOS>
among
the
women
spectators
,
as
they
resumed
their
work
.
<EOS>
Suicide
at
the
bar
of
justice
was
no
uncommon
occurrence
,
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Name
?
"
asked
the
president
,
quietly
taking
up
his
pen
and
opening
a
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Martigne
,
"
answered
the
humpbacked
jailer
,
coming
forward
to
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Description
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ex
-
royalist
coach
-
maker
to
the
tyrant
Capet
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Accusation
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Conspiracy
in
prison
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
president
nodded
,
and
entered
in
the
book
:
"
Martigne
,
coachmaker
.
<EOS>
Accused
of
conspiring
in
prison
.
<EOS>
Anticipated
course
of
law
by
suicide
.
<EOS>
Action
accepted
as
sufficient
confession
of
guilt
.
<EOS>
Goods
confiscated
.
<EOS>
1st
Thermidor
,
year
two
of
the
Republic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
cried
the
man
with
the
bludgeon
,
as
the
president
dropped
a
little
sand
on
the
entry
,
and
signing
to
the
jailer
that
he
might
remove
the
dead
body
,
closed
the
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Any
special
cases
this
morning
?
"
resumed
the
president
,
looking
round
at
the
group
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
one
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
making
his
way
to
the
back
of
the
official
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
it
be
convenient
to
you
,
citizen
,
to
take
the
case
of
Louis
Trudaine
and
Rose
Danville
first
?
<EOS>
Two
of
my
men
are
detained
here
as
witnesses
,
and
their
time
is
valuable
to
the
Republic
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
president
marked
a
list
of
names
before
him
,
and
handed
it
to
the
crier
or
usher
,
placing
the
figures
one
and
two
against
Louis
Trudaine
and
Rose
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
While
Lomaque
was
backing
again
to
his
former
place
behind
the
chair
,
Danville
approached
and
whispered
to
him
,
"
There
is
a
rumor
that
secret
information
has
reached
you
about
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Dubois
.
<EOS>
Is
it
true
?
<EOS>
Do
you
know
who
they
are
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
answered
Lomaque
;
"
but
I
have
superior
orders
to
keep
the
information
to
myself
just
at
present
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
eagerness
with
which
Danville
put
his
question
,
and
the
disappointment
he
showed
on
getting
no
satisfactory
answer
to
it
,
were
of
a
nature
to
satisfy
the
observant
chief
agent
that
his
superintendent
was
really
as
ignorant
as
he
appeared
to
be
on
the
subject
of
the
man
and
woman
Dubois
.
<EOS>
That
one
mystery
,
at
any
rate
was
still
,
for
Danville
,
a
mystery
unrevealed
.
  
<EOS>
"
Louis
Trudaine
!
<EOS>
Rose
Danville
!
<EOS>
"
shouted
the
crier
,
with
another
rap
of
his
bludgeon
.
  
<EOS>
The
two
came
forward
,
at
the
appeal
,
to
the
front
railing
of
the
platform
.
<EOS>
The
first
sight
of
her
judges
,
the
first
shock
on
confronting
the
pitiless
curiosity
of
the
audience
,
seemed
to
overwhelm
Rose
.
<EOS>
She
turned
from
deadly
pale
to
crimson
,
then
to
pale
again
,
and
hid
her
face
on
her
brother
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
How
fast
she
heard
his
heart
throbbing
!
<EOS>
How
the
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
she
felt
that
his
fear
was
all
for
her
!
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
"
said
the
president
,
writing
down
their
names
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Denounced
by
whom
?
"
  
<EOS>
Magloire
and
Picard
stepped
forward
to
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
first
answered
 
"
By
Citizen
Superintendent
Danville
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
reply
made
a
great
stir
and
sensation
among
both
prisoners
and
audience
.
  
<EOS>
"
Accused
of
what
?
"
pursued
the
president
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
male
prisoner
,
of
conspiracy
against
the
Republic
;
the
female
prisoner
,
of
criminal
knowledge
of
the
same
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Produce
your
proofs
in
answer
to
this
order
.
"
  
<EOS>
Picard
and
Magloire
opened
their
minutes
of
evidence
,
and
read
to
the
president
the
same
particulars
which
they
had
formerly
read
to
Lomaque
in
the
secret
police
office
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
,
"
said
the
president
,
when
they
had
done
,
"
we
need
trouble
ourselves
with
nothing
more
than
the
identifying
of
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Dubois
,
which
,
of
course
,
you
are
prepared
for
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
the
evidence
?
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
the
prisoners
;
while
Picard
and
Magloire
consulted
together
in
whispers
,
looking
perplexedly
toward
the
chief
agent
,
who
stood
silent
behind
them
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
the
evidence
,
prisoners
?
<EOS>
Do
you
wish
to
say
anything
?
<EOS>
If
you
do
,
remember
that
the
time
of
this
tribunal
is
precious
,
and
that
you
will
not
be
suffered
to
waste
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
demand
permission
to
speak
for
myself
and
for
my
sister
,
"
answered
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
My
object
is
to
save
the
time
of
the
tribunal
by
making
a
confession
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
faint
whispering
,
audible
among
the
women
spectators
a
moment
before
,
ceased
instantaneously
as
he
pronounced
the
word
confession
.
<EOS>
In
the
breathless
silence
,
his
low
,
quiet
tones
penetrated
to
the
remotest
corners
of
the
hall
;
while
,
suppressing
externally
all
evidences
of
the
death
-
agony
of
hope
within
him
,
he
continued
his
address
in
these
words
:
  
"
I
confess
my
secret
visits
to
the
house
in
the
Rue
de
Clery
.
<EOS>
I
confess
that
the
persons
whom
I
went
to
see
are
the
persons
pointed
at
in
the
evidence
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
I
confess
that
my
object
in
communicating
with
them
as
I
did
was
to
supply
them
with
the
means
of
leaving
France
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
acted
from
political
motives
to
the
political
prejudice
of
the
existing
government
,
I
admit
that
I
should
be
guilty
of
that
conspiracy
against
the
Republic
with
which
I
am
charged
.
<EOS>
But
no
political
purpose
animated
,
no
political
necessity
urged
me
,
in
performing
the
action
which
has
brought
me
to
the
bar
of
this
tribunal
.
<EOS>
The
persons
whom
I
aided
in
leaving
France
were
without
political
influence
or
political
connections
.
<EOS>
I
acted
solely
from
private
motives
of
humanity
toward
them
and
toward
others
 
motives
which
a
good
republican
may
feel
,
and
yet
not
turn
traitor
to
the
welfare
of
his
country
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
ready
to
inform
the
court
,
next
,
who
the
man
and
woman
Dubois
really
are
?
"
inquired
the
president
,
impatiently
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
,
"
answered
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
But
first
I
desire
to
say
one
word
in
reference
to
my
sister
,
charged
here
at
the
bar
with
me
.
"
<EOS>
His
voice
grew
less
steady
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
his
color
began
to
change
,
as
Rose
lifted
her
face
from
his
shoulder
and
looked
up
at
him
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
I
implore
the
tribunal
to
consider
my
sister
as
innocent
of
all
active
participation
in
what
is
charged
against
me
as
a
crime
"
He
went
on
.
"
Having
spoken
with
candor
about
myself
,
I
have
some
claim
to
be
believed
when
I
speak
of
her
;
when
I
assert
that
she
neither
did
help
me
nor
could
help
me
.
<EOS>
If
there
be
blame
,
it
is
mine
only
;
if
punishment
,
it
is
I
alone
who
should
suffer
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
suddenly
,
and
grew
confused
.
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
guard
himself
from
the
peril
of
looking
at
Rose
,
but
he
could
not
escape
the
hard
trial
to
his
self
-
possession
of
hearing
her
,
if
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
pronounced
the
last
sentence
,
she
raised
her
face
again
from
his
shoulder
,
and
eagerly
whispered
to
him
:
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
Louis
!
<EOS>
Not
that
sacrifice
,
after
all
the
others
 
not
that
,
though
you
should
force
me
into
speaking
to
them
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
abruptly
quitted
her
hold
of
him
,
and
fronted
the
whole
court
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
The
railing
in
front
of
her
shook
with
the
quivering
of
her
arms
and
hands
as
she
held
by
it
to
support
herself
!
<EOS>
Her
hair
lay
tangled
on
her
shoulders
;
her
face
had
assumed
a
strange
fixedness
;
her
gentle
blue
eyes
,
so
soft
and
tender
at
all
other
times
,
were
lit
up
wildly
.
<EOS>
A
low
hum
of
murmured
curiosity
and
admiration
broke
from
the
women
of
the
audience
.
<EOS>
Some
rose
eagerly
from
the
benches
;
others
cried
:
  
"
Listen
,
listen
!
<EOS>
she
is
going
to
speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
did
speak
.
<EOS>
Silvery
and
pure
the
sweet
voice
,
sweeter
than
ever
in
sadness
,
stole
its
way
through
the
gross
sounds
 
through
the
coarse
humming
and
the
hissing
whispers
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
the
president
,
"
began
the
poor
girl
firmly
.
<EOS>
Her
next
words
were
drowned
in
a
volley
of
hisses
from
the
women
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
aristocrat
,
aristocrat
!
<EOS>
None
of
your
accursed
titles
here
!
"
<EOS>
was
their
shrill
cry
at
her
.
<EOS>
She
fronted
that
cry
,
she
fronted
the
fierce
gestures
which
accompanied
it
,
with
the
steady
light
still
in
her
eyes
,
with
the
strange
rigidity
still
fastened
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
spoken
again
through
the
uproar
and
execration
,
but
her
brother
's
voice
overpowered
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Citizen
president
,
"
he
cried
,
"
I
have
not
concluded
.
<EOS>
I
demand
leave
to
complete
my
confession
.
<EOS>
I
implore
the
tribunal
to
 
attach
no
importance
to
what
my
sister
says
.
<EOS>
The
trouble
and
terror
of
this
day
have
shaken
her
intellects
.
<EOS>
She
is
not
responsible
for
her
words
 
<EOS>
I
assert
it
solemnly
,
in
the
face
of
the
whole
court
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
blood
flew
up
into
his
white
face
as
he
made
the
asseveration
.
<EOS>
Even
at
that
supreme
moment
the
great
heart
of
the
man
reproached
him
for
yielding
himself
to
a
deception
,
though
the
motive
of
it
was
to
save
his
sister
's
life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
her
speak
!
<EOS>
let
her
speak
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
women
,
as
Rose
,
without
moving
,
without
looking
at
her
brother
,
without
seeming
even
to
have
heard
what
he
said
,
made
a
second
attempt
to
address
her
judges
,
in
spite
of
Trudaine
's
interposition
.
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
shouted
the
man
with
the
bludgeon
.
<EOS>
"
Silence
,
you
women
!
<EOS>
the
citizen
president
is
going
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
prisoner
Trudaine
has
the
ear
of
the
court
,
"
said
the
president
,
"
and
may
continue
his
confession
.
<EOS>
If
the
female
prisoner
wishes
to
speak
,
she
may
be
heard
afterward
.
<EOS>
I
enjoin
both
the
accused
persons
to
make
short
work
of
it
with
their
addresses
to
me
,
or
they
will
make
their
case
worse
instead
of
better
.
<EOS>
I
command
silence
among
the
audience
,
and
if
I
am
not
obeyed
,
I
will
clear
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Now
,
prisoner
Trudaine
,
I
invite
you
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
No
more
about
your
sister
;
let
her
speak
for
herself
.
<EOS>
Your
business
and
ours
is
with
the
man
and
woman
Dubois
.
<EOS>
Are
you
,
or
are
you
not
,
ready
to
tell
the
court
who
they
are
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
that
I
am
ready
,
"
answered
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
citizen
Dubois
is
a
servant
.
<EOS>
The
woman
Dubois
is
the
mother
of
the
man
who
denounces
me
 
Superintendent
Danville
.
"
  
<EOS>
A
low
,
murmuring
,
rushing
sound
of
hundreds
of
exclaiming
voices
,
all
speaking
,
half
-
suppressedly
,
at
the
same
moment
,
followed
the
delivery
of
the
answer
.
<EOS>
No
officer
of
the
court
attempted
to
control
the
outburst
of
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
infection
of
it
spread
to
the
persons
on
the
platform
,
to
the
crier
himself
,
to
the
judges
of
the
tribunal
,
lounging
,
but
the
moment
before
,
so
carelessly
silent
in
their
chairs
.
<EOS>
When
the
noise
was
at
length
quelled
,
it
was
subdued
in
the
most
instantaneous
manner
by
one
man
,
who
shouted
from
the
throng
behind
the
president
's
chair
:
  
"
Clear
the
way
there
!
<EOS>
Superintendent
Danville
is
taken
ill
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
vehement
whispering
and
contending
of
many
voices
interrupting
each
other
,
followed
;
then
a
swaying
among
the
assembly
of
official
people
;
then
a
great
stillness
;
then
the
sudden
appearance
of
Danville
,
alone
,
at
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
The
look
of
him
,
as
he
turned
his
ghastly
face
toward
the
audience
,
silenced
and
steadied
them
in
an
instant
,
just
as
they
were
on
the
point
of
falling
into
fresh
confusion
.
<EOS>
Every
one
stretched
forward
eagerly
to
hear
what
he
would
say
.
<EOS>
His
lips
moved
;
but
the
few
words
that
fell
from
them
were
inaudible
,
except
to
the
persons
who
happened
to
be
close
by
him
.
<EOS>
Having
spoken
,
he
left
the
table
supported
by
a
police
agent
,
who
was
seen
to
lead
him
toward
the
private
door
of
the
court
,
and
,
consequently
,
also
toward
the
prisoners
'
platform
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
however
,
halfway
,
quickly
turned
his
face
from
the
prisoners
,
and
pointing
toward
the
public
door
at
the
opposite
side
of
the
hall
,
caused
himself
to
be
led
out
into
the
air
by
that
direction
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
gone
the
president
,
addressing
himself
partly
to
Trudaine
and
partly
to
the
audience
,
said
:
  
"
The
Citizen
Superintendent
Danville
has
been
overcome
by
the
heat
in
the
court
.
<EOS>
He
has
retired
by
my
desire
,
under
the
care
of
a
police
agent
,
to
recover
in
the
open
air
;
pledging
himself
to
me
to
come
back
and
throw
a
new
light
on
the
extraordinary
and
suspicious
statement
which
the
prisoner
has
just
made
.
<EOS>
Until
the
return
of
Citizen
Danville
,
I
order
the
accused
,
Trudaine
,
to
suspend
any
further
acknowledgment
of
complicity
which
he
may
have
to
address
to
me
.
<EOS>
This
matter
must
be
cleared
up
before
other
matters
are
entered
on
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
in
order
that
the
time
of
the
tribunal
may
not
be
wasted
,
I
authorize
the
female
prisoner
to
take
this
opportunity
of
making
any
statement
concerning
herself
which
she
may
wish
to
address
to
the
judges
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
Remove
him
out
of
court
!
"
<EOS>
"
Gag
him
!
"
<EOS>
"
Guillotine
him
!
"
<EOS>
These
cries
rose
from
the
audience
the
moment
the
president
had
done
speaking
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
directed
at
Trudaine
,
who
had
made
a
last
desperate
effort
to
persuade
his
sister
to
keep
silence
,
and
had
been
detected
in
the
attempt
by
the
spectators
.
  
<EOS>
"
If
the
prisoner
speaks
another
word
to
his
sister
,
remove
him
,
"
said
the
president
,
addressing
the
guard
round
the
platform
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
<EOS>
we
shall
hear
her
at
last
.
<EOS>
Silence
!
<EOS>
silence
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
women
,
settling
themselves
comfortably
on
their
benches
,
and
preparing
to
resume
their
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rose
Danville
,
the
court
is
waiting
to
hear
you
,
"
said
the
president
,
crossing
his
legs
and
leaning
back
luxuriously
in
his
large
armchair
.
  
<EOS>
Amid
all
the
noise
and
confusion
of
the
last
few
minutes
,
Rose
had
stood
ever
in
the
same
attitude
,
with
that
strangely
fixed
expression
never
altering
on
her
face
but
once
.
<EOS>
When
her
husband
made
his
way
to
the
side
of
the
table
and
stood
there
prominently
alone
,
her
lips
trembled
a
little
,
and
a
faint
shade
of
color
passed
swiftly
over
her
cheeks
.
<EOS>
Even
that
slight
change
had
vanished
now
 
<EOS>
she
was
paler
,
stiller
,
more
widely
altered
from
her
former
self
than
ever
,
as
she
faced
the
president
and
said
these
words
:
  
"
I
wish
to
follow
my
brother
's
example
and
make
my
confession
,
as
he
has
made
his
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
he
had
spoken
for
me
;
but
he
is
too
generous
to
say
any
words
except
such
as
he
thinks
may
save
me
from
sharing
his
punishment
.
<EOS>
I
refuse
to
be
saved
,
unless
he
is
saved
with
me
.
<EOS>
Where
he
goes
when
he
leaves
this
place
,
I
will
go
;
what
he
suffers
,
I
will
suffer
;
if
he
is
to
die
,
I
believe
God
will
grant
me
the
strength
to
die
resignedly
with
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
She
paused
for
a
moment
,
and
half
turned
toward
Trudaine
 
then
checked
herself
instantly
and
went
on
:
"
<EOS>
This
is
what
I
now
wish
to
say
,
as
to
my
share
in
the
offense
charged
against
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Some
time
ago
,
he
told
me
one
day
that
he
had
seen
my
husband
's
mother
in
Paris
,
disguised
as
a
poor
woman
;
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
,
and
forced
her
to
acknowledge
herself
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
time
we
had
all
felt
certain
that
she
had
left
France
,
because
she
held
old
-
fashioned
opinions
which
it
is
dangerous
for
people
to
hold
now
 
had
left
France
before
we
came
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
She
told
my
brother
that
she
had
indeed
gone
(
with
an
old
,
tried
servant
of
the
family
to
help
and
protect
her
)
as
far
as
Marseilles
;
and
that
,
finding
unforeseen
difficulty
there
in
getting
further
,
she
had
taken
it
as
a
warning
from
Providence
not
to
desert
her
son
,
of
whom
she
was
very
passionately
fond
,
and
from
whom
she
had
been
most
unwilling
to
depart
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
waiting
in
exile
for
quieter
times
,
she
determined
to
go
and
hide
herself
in
Paris
,
knowing
her
son
was
going
there
too
.
<EOS>
She
assumed
the
name
of
her
old
and
faithful
servant
,
who
declined
to
the
last
to
leave
her
unprotected
;
and
she
proposed
to
live
in
the
strictest
secrecy
and
retirement
,
watching
,
unknown
,
the
career
of
her
son
,
and
ready
at
a
moment
's
notice
to
disclose
herself
to
him
,
when
the
settlement
of
public
affairs
might
reunite
her
safely
to
her
beloved
child
.
<EOS>
My
brother
thought
this
plan
full
of
danger
,
both
for
herself
,
for
her
son
,
and
for
the
honest
old
man
who
was
risking
his
head
for
his
mistress
's
sake
.
<EOS>
I
thought
so
too
;
and
in
an
evil
hour
I
said
to
Louis
:
"
Will
you
try
in
secret
to
get
my
husband
's
mother
away
,
and
see
that
her
faithful
servant
makes
her
really
leave
France
this
time
?
<EOS>
"
I
wrongly
asked
my
brother
to
do
this
for
a
selfish
reason
of
my
own
 
a
reason
connected
with
my
married
life
,
which
has
not
been
a
happy
one
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
succeeded
in
gaining
my
husband
's
affection
,
and
was
not
treated
kindly
by
him
.
<EOS>
My
brother
 
who
has
always
loved
me
far
more
dearly
,
I
am
afraid
,
than
I
have
ever
deserved
 
my
brother
increased
his
kindness
to
me
,
seeing
me
treated
unkindly
by
my
husband
.
<EOS>
This
made
ill
-
blood
between
them
.
<EOS>
My
thought
,
when
I
asked
my
brother
to
do
for
me
<EOS>
what
I
have
said
,
was
,
that
if
we
two
in
secret
saved
my
husband
's
mother
,
without
danger
to
him
,
from
imperiling
herself
and
her
son
,
we
should
,
when
the
time
came
for
speaking
of
what
we
had
done
,
appear
to
my
husband
in
a
new
and
better
light
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
shown
how
well
I
deserved
his
love
,
and
Louis
would
have
shown
how
well
he
deserved
his
brother
-
in
-
law
's
gratitude
;
and
so
we
should
have
made
home
happy
at
last
,
and
all
three
have
lived
together
affectionately
.
<EOS>
This
was
my
thought
;
and
when
I
told
it
to
my
brother
,
and
asked
him
if
there
would
be
much
risk
,
out
of
his
kindness
and
indulgence
toward
me
,
he
said
"
No
.
<EOS>
"
He
had
so
used
me
to
accept
sacrifices
for
my
happiness
that
I
let
him
endanger
himself
to
help
me
in
my
little
household
plan
.
<EOS>
I
repent
this
bitterly
now
;
I
ask
his
pardon
with
my
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
acquitted
,
I
will
try
to
show
myself
worthier
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
found
guilty
,
I
,
too
,
will
go
to
the
scaffold
,
and
die
with
my
brother
,
who
risked
his
life
for
my
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
ceased
as
quietly
as
she
had
begun
,
and
turned
once
more
to
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
As
she
looked
away
from
the
court
and
looked
at
him
,
a
few
tears
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
something
of
the
old
softness
of
form
and
gentleness
of
expression
seemed
to
return
to
her
face
.
<EOS>
He
let
her
take
his
hand
,
but
he
seemed
purposely
to
avoid
meeting
the
anxious
gaze
she
fixed
on
him
.
<EOS>
His
head
sunk
on
his
breast
;
he
drew
his
breath
heavily
,
his
countenance
darkened
and
grew
distorted
,
as
if
he
were
suffering
some
sharp
pang
of
physical
pain
.
<EOS>
He
bent
down
a
little
,
and
,
leaning
his
elbow
on
the
rail
before
him
,
covered
his
face
with
his
hand
;
and
so
quelled
the
rising
agony
,
so
forced
back
the
scalding
tears
to
his
heart
.
<EOS>
The
audience
had
heard
Rose
in
silence
,
and
they
preserved
the
same
tranquillity
when
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
rare
tribute
to
a
prisoner
from
the
people
of
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
  
<EOS>
The
president
looked
round
at
his
colleagues
,
and
shook
his
head
suspiciously
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
statement
of
the
female
prisoner
's
complicates
the
matter
very
seriously
,
"
said
he
.
<EOS>
"
Is
there
anybody
in
court
,
"
he
added
,
looking
at
the
persons
behind
his
chair
,
"
who
knows
where
the
mother
of
Superintendent
Danville
and
the
servant
are
now
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
came
forward
at
the
appeal
,
and
placed
himself
by
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
,
citizen
agent
!
<EOS>
"
continued
the
president
,
looking
hard
at
him
,
"
are
you
overcome
by
the
heat
,
too
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
fit
seemed
to
take
him
,
citizen
president
,
when
the
female
prisoner
had
made
an
end
of
her
statement
,
"
exclaimed
Magloire
,
pressing
forward
officiously
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
gave
his
subordinate
a
look
which
sent
the
man
back
directly
to
the
shelter
of
the
official
group
;
then
said
,
in
lower
tones
than
were
customary
with
him
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
received
information
relative
to
the
mother
of
Superintendent
Danville
and
the
servant
,
and
am
ready
to
answer
any
questions
that
may
be
put
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
they
now
?
"
asked
the
president
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
and
the
servant
are
known
to
have
crossed
the
frontier
,
and
are
supposed
to
be
on
their
way
to
Cologne
.
<EOS>
But
,
since
they
have
entered
Germany
,
their
whereabouts
is
necessarily
a
matter
of
uncertainty
to
the
republican
authorities
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
any
information
relative
to
the
conduct
of
the
old
servant
while
he
was
in
Paris

"
  
"
I
have
information
enough
to
prove
that
he
was
not
an
object
for
political
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
have
been
simply
animated
by
servile
zeal
for
the
woman
's
interests
;
to
have
performed
for
her
all
the
menial
offices
of
a
servant
in
private
;
and
to
have
misled
the
neighbors
by
affected
equality
with
her
in
public
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
reason
to
believe
that
Superintendent
Danville
was
privy
to
his
mother
's
first
attempt
at
escaping
from
France
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
infer
it
from
what
the
female
prisoner
has
said
,
and
for
other
reasons
which
it
would
be
irregular
to
detail
before
the
tribunal
.
<EOS>
The
proofs
can
no
doubt
be
obtained
if
I
am
allowed
time
to
communicate
with
the
authorities
at
Lyons
and
Marseilles
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
Danville
re
-
entered
the
court
;
and
,
advancing
to
the
table
,
placed
himself
close
by
the
chief
agent
's
side
.
<EOS>
They
looked
each
other
steadily
in
the
face
for
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
recovered
from
the
shock
of
Trudaine
's
answer
,
"
thought
Lomaque
,
retiring
.
"
<EOS>
His
hand
trembles
,
his
face
is
pale
,
but
I
can
see
regained
self
-
possession
in
his
eye
,
and
I
dread
the
consequences
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Citizen
president
,
"
began
Danville
,
"
I
demand
to
know
if
anything
has
transpired
affecting
my
honor
and
patriotism
in
my
absence
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
apparently
with
the
most
perfect
calmness
,
but
he
looked
nobody
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
fixed
steadily
on
the
green
baize
of
the
table
beneath
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
female
prisoner
has
made
a
statement
,
referring
principally
to
herself
and
her
brother
,
"
answered
the
president
,
"
but
incidentally
mentioning
a
previous
attempt
on
your
mother
's
part
to
break
existing
laws
by
emigrating
from
France
.
<EOS>
This
portion
of
the
confession
contains
in
it
some
elements
of
suspicion
which
seriously
affect
you
"
  
"
They
shall
be
suspicions
no
longer
 
at
my
own
peril
I
will
change
them
to
certainties
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Danville
,
extending
his
arm
theatrically
,
and
looking
up
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Citizen
president
,
I
avow
it
with
the
fearless
frankness
of
a
good
patriot
;
I
was
privy
to
my
mother
's
first
attempt
at
escaping
from
France
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Hisses
and
cries
of
execration
followed
this
confession
.
<EOS>
He
winced
under
them
at
first
;
but
recovered
his
self
-
possession
before
silence
was
restored
.
  
<EOS>
"
Citizens
,
you
have
heard
the
confession
of
my
fault
,
"
he
resumed
,
turning
with
desperate
assurance
toward
the
audience
;
"
now
hear
the
atonement
I
have
made
for
it
at
the
altar
of
my
country
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
waited
at
the
end
of
that
sentence
,
until
the
secretary
to
the
tribunal
had
done
writing
it
down
in
the
report
book
of
the
court
.
  
<EOS>
"
Transcribe
faithfully
to
the
letter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Danville
,
pointing
solemnly
to
the
open
page
of
the
volume
.
<EOS>
"
Life
and
death
hang
on
my
words
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
secretary
took
a
fresh
dip
of
ink
,
and
nodded
to
show
that
he
was
ready
.
<EOS>
Danville
went
on
:
  
"
<EOS>
In
these
times
of
glory
and
trial
for
France
,
"
he
proceeded
,
pitching
his
voice
to
a
tone
of
deep
emotion
,
"
what
are
all
good
citizens
most
sacredly
bound
to
do
?
<EOS>
To
immolate
their
dearest
private
affections
and
interests
before
their
public
duties
!
<EOS>
On
the
first
attempt
of
my
mother
to
violate
the
laws
against
emigration
,
by
escaping
from
France
,
I
failed
in
making
the
heroic
sacrifice
which
inexorable
patriotism
demanded
of
me
.
<EOS>
My
situation
was
more
terrible
than
the
situation
of
Brutus
sitting
in
judgment
on
his
own
sons
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
the
Roman
fortitude
to
rise
equal
to
it
.
<EOS>
I
erred
,
citizens
 
erred
as
Coriolanus
did
,
when
his
august
mother
pleaded
with
him
for
the
safety
of
Rome
!
<EOS>
For
that
error
I
deserved
to
be
purged
out
of
the
republican
community
;
but
I
escaped
my
merited
punishment
 
<EOS>
nay
,
I
even
rose
to
the
honor
of
holding
an
office
under
the
Government
.
<EOS>
Time
passed
;
and
again
my
mother
attempted
an
escape
from
France
.
<EOS>
Again
,
inevitable
fate
brought
my
civic
virtue
to
the
test
.
<EOS>
How
did
I
meet
this
second
supremest
trial
?
<EOS>
By
an
atonement
for
past
weakness
,
terrible
as
the
trial
itself
.
<EOS>
Citizens
,
you
will
shudder
;
but
you
will
applaud
while
you
tremble
.
<EOS>
Citizens
,
look
!
<EOS>
and
while
you
look
,
remember
well
the
evidence
given
at
the
opening
of
this
case
.
<EOS>
Yonder
stands
the
enemy
of
his
country
,
who
intrigued
to
help
my
mother
to
escape
;
here
stands
the
patriot
son
,
whose
voice
was
the
first
,
the
only
voice
,
to
denounce
him
for
the
crime
!
"
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
pointed
to
Trudaine
,
then
struck
himself
on
the
breast
,
then
folded
his
arms
,
and
looked
sternly
at
the
benches
occupied
by
the
spectators
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
assert
,
"
exclaimed
the
president
,
"
that
at
the
time
when
you
denounced
Trudaine
,
you
knew
him
to
be
intriguing
to
aid
your
mother
's
escape
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
assert
it
,
"
answered
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
The
pen
which
the
president
held
dropped
from
his
hand
at
that
reply
;
his
colleagues
started
,
and
looked
at
each
other
in
blank
silence
.
  
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
"
Monster
!
monster
!
<EOS>
"
began
with
the
prisoners
on
the
platform
,
and
spread
instantly
to
the
audience
,
who
echoed
and
echoed
it
again
;
the
fiercest
woman
-
republican
on
the
benches
joined
cause
at
last
with
the
haughtiest
woman
-
aristocrat
on
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Even
in
that
sphere
of
direst
discords
,
in
that
age
of
sharpest
enmities
,
the
one
touch
of
Nature
preserved
its
old
eternal
virtue
,
and
roused
the
mother
-
instinct
which
makes
the
whole
world
kin
.
  
<EOS>
Of
the
few
persons
in
the
court
who
at
once
foresaw
the
effect
of
Danville
's
answer
on
the
proceedings
of
the
tribunal
,
Lomaque
was
one
.
<EOS>
His
sallow
face
whitened
as
he
looked
toward
the
prisoners
'
platform
.
  
<EOS>
"
They
are
lost
,
"
he
murmured
to
himself
,
moving
out
of
the
group
in
which
he
had
hitherto
stood
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lost
!
<EOS>
The
lie
which
has
saved
that
villain
's
head
leaves
them
without
the
shadow
of
a
hope
.
<EOS>
No
need
to
stop
for
the
sentence
 
<EOS>
Danville
's
infamous
presence
of
mind
has
given
them
up
to
the
guillotine
!
<EOS>
"
Pronouncing
these
words
,
he
went
out
hurriedly
by
a
door
near
the
platform
,
which
led
to
the
prisoners
'
waiting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Rose
's
head
sank
again
on
her
brother
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
She
shuddered
,
and
leaned
back
faintly
on
the
arm
which
he
extended
to
support
her
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
female
prisoners
tried
to
help
Trudaine
in
speaking
consolingly
to
her
;
but
the
consummation
of
her
husband
's
perfidy
seemed
to
have
paralyzed
her
at
heart
.
<EOS>
She
murmured
once
in
her
brother
's
ear
,
"
Louis
!
<EOS>
I
am
resigned
to
die
 
nothing
but
death
is
left
for
me
after
the
degradation
of
having
loved
that
man
.
"
<EOS>
She
said
those
words
and
closed
her
eyes
wearily
,
and
spoke
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
One
other
question
,
and
you
may
retire
,
"
resumed
the
president
,
addressing
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
Were
you
cognizant
of
your
wife
's
connection
with
her
brother
's
conspiracy
?
"
  
<EOS>
Danville
reflected
for
a
moment
,
remembered
that
there
were
witnesses
in
court
who
could
speak
to
his
language
and
behavior
on
the
evening
of
his
wife
's
arrest
,
and
resolved
this
time
to
tell
the
truth
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
aware
of
it
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Testimony
in
my
favor
can
be
called
which
will
prove
that
when
my
wife
's
complicity
was
discovered
I
was
absent
from
Paris
.
"
  
<EOS>
Heartlessly
self
-
possessed
as
he
was
,
the
public
reception
of
his
last
reply
had
shaken
his
nerve
.
<EOS>
He
now
spoke
in
low
tones
,
turning
his
back
on
the
spectators
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
again
on
the
green
baize
of
the
table
at
which
he
stood
.
  
<EOS>
"
Prisoners
,
have
you
any
objection
to
make
,
any
evidence
to
call
,
invalidating
the
statement
by
which
Citizen
Danville
has
cleared
himself
of
suspicion
?
"
inquired
the
president
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
cleared
himself
by
the
most
execrable
of
all
falsehoods
,
"
answered
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
If
his
mother
could
be
traced
and
brought
here
,
her
testimony
would
prove
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
produce
any
other
evidence
in
support
of
your
allegation
?
"
asked
the
president
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Citizen
Superintendent
Danville
,
you
are
at
liberty
to
retire
.
<EOS>
Your
statement
will
be
laid
before
the
authority
to
whom
you
are
officially
responsible
.
<EOS>
Either
you
merit
a
civic
crown
for
more
than
Roman
virtue
,
or
"
Having
got
thus
far
,
the
president
stopped
abruptly
,
as
if
unwilling
to
commit
himself
too
soon
to
an
opinion
,
and
merely
repeated
,
"
You
may
retire
.
"
  
<EOS>
Danville
left
the
court
immediately
,
going
out
again
by
the
public
door
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
murmurs
from
the
women
's
benches
,
which
soon
ceased
,
however
,
when
the
president
was
observed
to
close
his
note
-
book
,
and
turn
round
toward
his
colleagues
.
<EOS>
"
The
sentence
!
<EOS>
"
was
the
general
whisper
now
.
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
hush
 
the
sentence
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
consultation
of
a
few
minutes
with
the
persons
behind
him
,
the
president
rose
,
and
spoke
the
momentous
words
:
  
"
Louis
Trudaine
and
Rose
Danville
,
the
revolutionary
tribunal
,
having
heard
the
charge
against
you
,
and
having
weighed
the
value
of
what
you
have
said
in
answer
to
it
,
decides
that
you
are
both
guilty
,
and
condemns
you
to
the
penalty
of
death
.
"
  
<EOS>
Having
delivered
the
sentence
in
those
terms
,
he
sat
down
again
,
and
placed
a
mark
against
the
two
first
condemned
names
on
the
list
of
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Immediately
afterward
the
next
case
was
called
on
,
and
the
curiosity
of
the
audience
was
stimulated
by
a
new
trial
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
waiting
-
room
of
the
revolutionary
tribunal
was
a
grim
,
bare
place
,
with
a
dirty
stone
floor
,
and
benches
running
round
the
walls
.
<EOS>
The
windows
were
high
and
barred
;
and
at
the
outer
door
,
leading
into
the
street
,
two
sentinels
kept
watch
.
<EOS>
On
entering
this
comfortless
retreat
from
the
court
,
Lomaque
found
it
perfectly
empty
.
<EOS>
Solitude
was
just
then
welcome
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
the
waiting
-
room
,
walking
slowly
from
end
to
end
over
the
filthy
pavement
,
talking
eagerly
and
incessantly
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
the
door
communicating
with
the
tribunal
opened
,
and
the
humpbacked
jailer
made
his
appearance
,
leading
in
Trudaine
and
Rose
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
have
to
wait
here
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
"
till
the
rest
of
them
have
been
tried
and
sentenced
;
and
then
you
will
all
go
back
to
prison
in
a
lump
.
<EOS>
Ha
,
citizen
,
"
he
continued
,
observing
Lomaque
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
,
and
bustling
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
still
,
eh
?
<EOS>
If
you
were
going
to
stop
much
longer
,
I
should
ask
a
favor
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
in
no
hurry
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
with
a
glance
at
the
two
prisoners
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
!
"
cried
the
humpback
,
drawing
his
hand
across
his
mouth
;
"
I
am
parched
with
thirst
,
and
dying
to
moisten
my
throat
at
the
wine
-
shop
over
the
way
.
<EOS>
Just
mind
that
man
and
woman
while
I
'm
gone
,
will
you
?
<EOS>
It
's
the
merest
form
 
<EOS>
there
's
a
guard
outside
,
the
windows
are
barred
,
the
tribunal
is
within
hail
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
obliging
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
I
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
's
a
good
fellow
 
and
,
remember
,
if
I
am
asked
for
,
you
must
say
I
was
obliged
to
quit
the
court
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
left
you
in
charge
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
the
humpbacked
jailer
ran
off
to
the
wine
-
shop
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
disappeared
before
Trudaine
crossed
the
room
,
and
caught
Lomaque
by
the
arm
.
  
<EOS>
"
Save
her
,
"
he
whispered
;
"
there
is
an
opportunity
 
save
her
!
"
<EOS>
His
face
was
flushed
 
his
eyes
wandered
 
his
breath
on
the
chief
agent
's
cheek
,
while
he
spoke
,
felt
scorching
hot
.
"
<EOS>
Save
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
shaking
Lomaque
by
the
arm
,
and
dragging
him
toward
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
Remember
all
you
owe
to
my
father
 
remember
our
talk
on
that
bench
by
the
river
 
remember
what
you
said
to
me
yourself
on
the
night
of
the
arrest
 
do
n't
wait
to
think
 
save
her
,
and
leave
me
without
a
word
!
<EOS>
If
I
die
alone
,
I
can
die
as
a
man
should
;
if
she
goes
to
the
scaffold
by
my
side
,
my
heart
will
fail
me
 
<EOS>
I
shall
die
the
death
of
a
coward
!
<EOS>
I
have
lived
for
her
life
 
<EOS>
let
me
die
for
it
,
and
I
die
happy
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
tried
to
say
more
,
but
the
violence
of
his
agitation
forbade
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
shake
the
arm
he
held
again
and
again
,
and
point
to
the
bench
on
which
Rose
sat
 
her
head
sunk
on
her
bosom
,
her
hands
crossed
listlessly
on
her
lap
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
two
armed
sentinels
outside
 
<EOS>
the
windows
are
barred
 
<EOS>
you
are
without
weapons
 
and
even
if
you
had
them
,
there
is
a
guard
-
house
within
hail
on
one
side
of
you
,
and
the
tribunal
on
the
other
.
<EOS>
Escape
from
this
room
is
impossible
,
"
answered
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
Impossible
!
"
repeated
the
other
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
You
traitor
!
<EOS>
you
coward
!
<EOS>
can
you
look
at
her
sitting
there
helpless
,
her
very
life
ebbing
away
already
with
every
minute
that
passes
,
and
tell
me
coolly
that
escape
is
impossible
?
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
frenzy
of
his
grief
and
despair
,
he
lifted
his
disengaged
hand
threateningly
while
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
caught
him
by
the
wrist
,
and
drew
him
toward
a
window
open
at
the
top
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
not
in
your
right
senses
,
"
said
the
chief
agent
,
firmly
;
"
anxiety
and
apprehension
on
your
sister
's
account
have
shaken
your
mind
.
<EOS>
Try
to
compose
yourself
,
and
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
important
to
say
"
<EOS>
(
Trudaine
looked
at
him
incredulously
.
)
<EOS>
"
Important
,
"
continued
Lomaque
,
"
as
affecting
your
sister
's
interests
at
this
terrible
crisis
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
That
last
appeal
had
an
instantaneous
effect
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
's
outstretched
hand
dropped
to
his
side
,
and
a
sudden
change
passed
over
his
expression
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
a
moment
,
"
he
said
,
faintly
;
and
turning
away
,
leaned
against
the
wall
and
pressed
his
burning
forehead
on
the
chill
,
damp
stone
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
raise
his
head
again
till
he
had
mastered
himself
,
and
could
say
quietly
,
"
Speak
;
I
am
fit
to
hear
you
,
and
sufficiently
in
my
senses
to
ask
your
forgiveness
for
what
I
said
just
now
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
I
left
the
tribunal
and
entered
this
room
,
"
Lomaque
began
in
a
whisper
,
"
there
was
no
thought
in
my
mind
that
could
be
turned
to
good
account
,
either
for
your
sister
or
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
fit
for
nothing
but
to
deplore
the
failure
of
the
confession
which
I
came
to
St.
Lazare
to
suggest
to
you
as
your
best
plan
of
defense
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
an
idea
has
struck
me
,
which
may
be
useful
 
an
idea
so
desperate
,
so
uncertain
 
involving
a
proposal
so
absolutely
dependent
,
as
to
its
successful
execution
,
on
the
merest
chance
,
that
I
refuse
to
confide
it
to
you
except
on
one
condition
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mention
the
condition
!
<EOS>
I
submit
to
it
before
hand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Give
me
your
word
of
honor
that
you
will
not
mention
what
I
am
about
to
say
to
your
sister
until
I
grant
you
permission
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
that
when
you
see
her
shrinking
before
the
terrors
of
death
to
-
night
,
you
will
have
self
-
restraint
enough
to
abstain
from
breathing
a
word
of
hope
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
ask
this
,
because
there
are
ten
 
twenty
 
fifty
chances
to
one
that
there
is
no
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
choice
but
to
promise
,
"
answered
Trudaine
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
produced
his
pocket
-
book
and
pencil
before
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
enter
into
particulars
as
soon
as
I
have
asked
a
strange
question
of
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
a
great
experimenter
in
chemistry
in
your
time
 
<EOS>
is
your
mind
calm
enough
,
at
such
a
trying
moment
as
this
,
to
answer
a
question
which
is
connected
with
chemistry
in
a
very
humble
way
?
<EOS>
You
seem
astonished
.
<EOS>
Let
me
put
the
question
at
once
.
<EOS>
Is
there
any
liquid
or
powder
,
or
combination
of
more
than
one
ingredient
known
,
which
will
remove
writing
from
paper
,
and
leave
no
stain
behind
?
"
  
"
Certainly
!
<EOS>
But
is
that
all
the
question
?
<EOS>
Is
there
no
greater
difficulty
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
.
<EOS>
Write
the
prescription
,
whatever
it
may
be
,
on
that
leaf
,
"
said
the
other
,
giving
him
the
pocket
-
book
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Write
it
down
,
with
plain
directions
for
use
.
<EOS>
"
Trudaine
obeyed
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
first
step
,
"
continued
Lomaque
,
putting
the
book
in
his
pocket
,
"
toward
the
accomplishment
of
my
purpose
 
my
uncertain
purpose
,
remember
!
<EOS>
Now
,
listen
;
I
am
going
to
put
my
own
head
in
danger
for
the
chance
of
saving
yours
and
your
sister
's
by
tampering
with
the
death
-
list
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
interrupt
me
!
<EOS>
If
I
can
save
one
,
I
can
save
the
other
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
about
gratitude
!
<EOS>
Wait
till
you
know
the
extent
of
your
obligation
.
<EOS>
I
tell
you
plainly
,
at
the
outset
,
there
is
a
motive
of
despair
,
as
well
as
a
motive
of
pity
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
action
in
which
I
am
now
about
to
engage
.
<EOS>
Silence
!
<EOS>
I
insist
on
it
.
<EOS>
Our
time
is
short
;
it
is
for
me
to
speak
,
and
for
you
to
listen
.
<EOS>
The
president
of
the
tribunal
has
put
the
deathmark
against
your
names
on
the
prison
list
of
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
That
list
,
when
the
trials
are
over
and
it
is
marked
to
the
end
,
will
be
called
in
this
room
before
you
are
taken
to
St.
Lazare
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
be
sent
to
Robespierre
,
who
will
keep
it
,
having
a
copy
made
of
it
<EOS>
the
moment
it
is
delivered
,
for
circulation
among
his
colleagues
 
<EOS>
St.
Just
,
and
the
rest
.
<EOS>
It
is
my
business
to
make
a
duplicate
of
this
copy
in
the
first
instance
.
<EOS>
The
duplicate
will
be
compared
with
the
original
,
and
possibly
with
the
copy
,
too
,
either
by
Robespierre
himself
,
or
by
some
one
in
whom
he
can
place
implicit
trust
,
and
will
then
be
sent
to
St.
Lazare
without
passing
through
my
hands
again
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
read
in
public
the
moment
it
is
received
,
at
the
grating
of
the
prison
,
and
will
afterward
be
kept
by
the
jailer
,
who
will
refer
to
it
,
as
he
goes
round
in
the
evening
with
a
piece
of
chalk
,
to
mark
the
cell
doors
of
the
prisoners
destined
for
the
guillotine
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
That
duty
happens
,
to
-
day
,
to
fall
to
the
hunchback
whom
you
saw
speaking
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
confirmed
drinker
,
and
I
mean
to
tempt
him
with
such
wine
as
he
rarely
tastes
.
<EOS>
If
 
after
the
reading
of
the
list
in
public
,
and
before
the
marking
of
the
cell
doors
 
I
can
get
him
to
sit
down
to
the
bottle
,
I
will
answer
for
making
him
drunk
,
for
getting
the
list
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
for
wiping
your
names
out
of
it
with
the
prescription
you
have
just
written
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
write
all
the
names
,
one
under
another
,
just
irregularly
enough
in
my
duplicate
to
prevent
the
interval
left
by
the
erasure
from
being
easily
observed
.
<EOS>
If
I
succeed
in
this
,
your
door
will
not
be
marked
,
and
your
names
will
not
be
called
to
-
morrow
morning
when
the
tumbrils
come
for
the
guillotine
.
<EOS>
In
the
present
confusion
of
prisoners
pouring
in
every
day
for
trial
,
and
prisoners
pouring
out
every
day
for
execution
,
you
will
have
the
best
possible
chance
of
security
against
awkward
inquiries
,
if
you
play
your
cards
properly
,
for
a
good
fortnight
or
ten
days
at
least
.
<EOS>
In
that
time
"
  
"
Well
!
well
!
"
cried
Trudaine
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
looked
toward
the
tribunal
door
,
and
lowered
his
voice
to
a
fainter
whisper
before
he
continued
,
"
In
that
time
Robespierre
's
own
head
may
fall
into
the
sack
!
<EOS>
France
is
beginning
to
sicken
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
Frenchmen
of
the
Moderate
faction
,
who
have
lain
hidden
for
months
in
cellars
and
lofts
,
are
beginning
to
steal
out
and
deliberate
by
twos
and
threes
together
,
under
cover
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Robespierre
has
not
ventured
for
weeks
past
to
face
the
Convention
Committee
.
<EOS>
He
only
speaks
among
his
own
friends
at
the
Jacobins
.
<EOS>
There
are
rumors
of
a
terrible
discovery
made
by
Carnot
,
of
a
desperate
resolution
taken
by
Tallien
.
<EOS>
Men
watching
behind
the
scenes
see
that
the
last
days
of
the
Terror
are
at
hand
.
<EOS>
If
Robespierre
is
beaten
in
the
approaching
struggle
,
you
are
saved
 
for
the
new
reign
<EOS>
must
be
a
Reign
of
Mercy
.
<EOS>
If
he
conquers
,
I
have
only
put
off
the
date
of
your
death
and
your
sister
's
,
and
have
laid
my
own
neck
under
the
axe
.
<EOS>
Those
are
your
chances
 
this
is
all
I
can
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
paused
,
and
Trudaine
again
endeavored
to
speak
such
words
as
might
show
that
he
was
not
unworthy
of
the
deadly
risk
which
Lomaque
was
prepared
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
But
once
more
the
chief
agent
peremptorily
and
irritably
interposed
:
  
"
I
tell
you
,
for
the
third
time
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
will
listen
to
no
expressions
of
gratitude
from
you
till
I
know
when
I
deserve
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
true
that
I
recollect
your
father
's
timely
kindness
to
me
 
true
that
I
have
not
forgotten
what
passed
,
five
years
since
at
your
house
by
the
river
-
side
.
<EOS>
I
remember
everything
,
down
to
what
you
would
consider
the
veriest
trifle
 
that
cup
of
coffee
,
for
instance
,
which
your
sister
kept
hot
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
then
that
you
would
think
better
of
me
some
day
.
<EOS>
I
know
that
you
do
now
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
all
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
glorify
me
to
my
face
for
risking
my
life
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
hear
you
,
because
my
risk
is
of
the
paltriest
kind
.
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
look
back
to
it
with
pleasure
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
old
to
look
forward
to
what
is
left
of
it
with
hope
.
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
that
night
at
your
house
before
the
wedding
 
something
in
what
you
said
,
in
what
your
sister
did
 
which
altered
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
days
of
gloom
and
self
-
reproach
,
from
time
to
time
,
since
then
.
<EOS>
I
have
sickened
at
my
slavery
,
and
subjection
,
and
duplicity
,
and
cringing
,
first
under
one
master
then
under
another
.
<EOS>
I
have
longed
to
look
back
at
my
life
,
and
comfort
myself
with
the
sight
of
some
good
action
,
just
as
a
frugal
man
comforts
himself
with
the
sight
of
his
little
savings
laid
by
in
an
old
drawer
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
do
this
,
and
I
want
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
The
want
takes
me
like
a
fit
,
at
uncertain
intervals
 
suddenly
,
under
the
most
incomprehensible
influences
.
<EOS>
A
glance
up
at
the
blue
sky
 
starlight
over
the
houses
of
this
great
city
,
when
I
look
out
at
the
night
from
my
garret
window
 
a
child
's
voice
coming
suddenly
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
know
where
from
 
the
piping
of
my
neighbor
's
linnet
in
his
little
cage
 
now
one
trifling
thing
,
now
another
 
wakes
up
that
want
in
me
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Rascal
as
I
am
,
those
few
simple
words
your
sister
spoke
to
the
judge
went
through
and
through
me
like
a
knife
.
<EOS>
Strange
,
in
a
man
like
me
,
is
n't
it
?
<EOS>
I
am
amazed
at
it
myself
.
<EOS>
My
life
?
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
I
've
let
it
out
for
hire
to
be
kicked
about
by
rascals
from
one
dirty
place
to
another
,
like
a
football
!
<EOS>
It
's
my
whim
to
give
it
a
last
kick
myself
,
and
throw
it
away
decently
before
it
lodges
on
the
dunghill
forever
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
kept
a
good
cup
of
coffee
hot
for
me
,
and
I
give
her
a
bad
life
in
return
for
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
thank
me
for
it
?
<EOS>
What
folly
!
<EOS>
Thank
me
when
I
have
done
something
useful
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
thank
me
for
that
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
snapped
his
fingers
contemptuously
as
he
spoke
,
and
walked
away
to
the
outer
door
to
receive
the
jailer
,
who
returned
at
that
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
inquired
the
hunchback
,
"
has
anybody
asked
for
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Lomaque
;
"
not
a
soul
has
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
wine
did
you
get
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
So
-
so
!
<EOS>
Good
at
a
pinch
,
friend
 
<EOS>
good
at
a
pinch
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
should
go
to
my
shop
and
try
a
certain
cask
,
filled
with
a
particular
vintage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
shop
?
<EOS>
Which
vintage
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
stop
to
tell
you
now
;
but
we
shall
most
likely
meet
again
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
be
at
the
prison
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
ask
for
you
?
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
forget
!
"
<EOS>
With
those
farewell
words
he
went
out
,
and
never
so
much
as
looked
back
at
the
prisoners
before
he
closed
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
returned
to
his
sister
,
fearful
lest
his
face
should
betray
what
had
passed
during
the
extraordinary
interview
between
Lomaque
and
himself
.
<EOS>
But
,
whatever
change
there
might
be
in
his
expression
,
Rose
did
not
seem
to
notice
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
still
strangely
inattentive
to
all
outward
things
.
<EOS>
That
spirit
of
resignation
,
which
is
the
courage
of
women
in
all
great
emergencies
,
seemed
now
to
be
the
one
animating
spirit
that
fed
the
flame
of
life
within
her
.
  
<EOS>
When
her
brother
sat
down
by
her
,
she
only
took
his
hand
gently
and

"
Let
us
stop
together
like
this
,
Louis
,
till
the
time
comes
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
of
it
,
for
I
have
nothing
but
you
to
make
me
love
life
,
and
you
,
too
,
are
going
to
die
.
<EOS>
Do
you
remember
the
time
when
I
used
to
grieve
that
I
had
never
had
a
child
to
be
some
comfort
to
me
?
<EOS>
I
was
thinking
,
a
moment
ago
,
how
terrible
it
would
have
been
now
,
if
my
wish
had
been
granted
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
blessing
for
me
,
in
this
great
misery
,
that
I
am
childless
.
<EOS>
Let
us
talk
of
old
days
,
Louis
,
as
long
as
we
can
 
not
of
my
husband
;
or
my
marriage
 
only
of
the
old
times
,
before
I
was
a
burden
and
a
trouble
to
you
.

.
  
<EOS>
The
day
wore
on
.
<EOS>
By
ones
and
twos
and
threes
at
a
time
,
the
condemned
prisoners
came
from
the
tribunal
,
and
collected
in
the
waiting
-
room
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
all
was
ready
for
the
calling
over
of
the
death
-
list
.
<EOS>
It
was
read
and
verified
by
an
officer
of
the
court
;
and
then
the
jailer
took
his
prisoners
back
to
St.
Lazare
.
  
<EOS>
Evening
came
.
<EOS>
The
prisoners
'
meal
had
been
served
;
the
duplicate
of
the
death
-
list
had
been
read
in
public
at
the
grate
;
the
cell
doors
were
all
locked
.
<EOS>
From
the
day
of
their
arrest
,
Rose
and
her
brother
,
partly
through
the
influence
of
a
bribe
,
partly
through
Lomaque
's
intercession
,
had
been
confined
together
in
one
cell
;
and
together
they
now
awaited
the
dread
event
of
the
morrow
.
  
<EOS>
To
Rose
that
event
was
death
 
death
,
to
the
thought
of
which
,
at
least
,
she
was
now
resigned
.
<EOS>
To
Trudaine
the
fast
-
nearing
future
was
darkening
hour
by
hour
,
with
the
uncertainty
which
is
worse
than
death
;
with
the
faint
,
fearful
,
unpartaken
suspense
,
which
keeps
the
mind
ever
on
the
rack
,
and
wears
away
the
heart
slowly
.
<EOS>
Through
the
long
unsolaced
agony
of
that
dreadful
night
,
but
one
relief
came
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
tension
of
every
nerve
,
the
crushing
weight
of
the
one
fatal
oppression
that
clung
to
every
thought
,
relaxed
a
little
when
Rose
's
bodily
powers
began
to
sink
under
her
mental
exhaustion
 
<EOS>
when
her
sad
,
dying
talk
of
the
happy
times
that
were
passed
ceased
softly
,
and
she
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
,
and
let
the
angel
of
slumber
take
her
yet
for
a
little
while
,
even
though
she
lay
already
under
the
shadow
of
the
angel
of
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
morning
came
,
and
the
hot
summer
sunrise
.
<EOS>
What
life
was
left
in
the
terrorstruck
city
awoke
for
the
day
faintly
;
and
still
the
suspense
of
the
long
night
remained
unlightened
.
<EOS>
It
was
drawing
near
the
hour
when
the
tumbrils
were
to
come
for
the
victims
doomed
on
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
's
ear
could
detect
even
the
faintest
sound
in
the
echoing
prison
region
outside
his
cell
.
<EOS>
Soon
,
listening
near
the
door
,
he
heard
voices
disputing
on
the
other
side
of
it
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
the
bolts
were
drawn
back
,
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
,
and
he
found
himself
standing
face
to
face
with
the
hunchback
and
one
of
the
subordinate
attendants
on
the
prisoners
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
this
last
man
sulkily
,
"
there
they
are
,
safe
in
their
cell
,
just
as
I
said
;
but
I
tell
you
again
they
are
not
down
in
the
list
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
mean
by
bullying
me
about
not
chalking
their
door
,
last
night
,
along
with
the
rest
?
<EOS>
Catch
me
doing
your
work
for
you
again
,
when
you
're
too
drunk
to
do
it
yourself
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hold
your
tongue
,
and
let
me
have
another
look
at
the
list
!
"
<EOS>
returned
the
hunchback
,
turning
away
from
the
cell
door
,
and
snatching
a
slip
of
paper
from
the
other
's
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
devil
take
me
if
I
can
make
head
or
tail
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
scratching
his
head
,
after
a
careful
examination
of
the
list
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
swear
that
I
read
over
their
names
at
the
grate
yesterday
afternoon
with
my
own
lips
;
and
yet
,
look
as
long
as
I
may
,
I
certainly
ca
n't
find
them
written
down
here
.
<EOS>
Give
us
a
pinch
,
friend
.
<EOS>
Am
I
awake
,
or
dreaming
?
<EOS>
drunk
or
sober
this
morning
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Sober
,
I
hope
,
"
said
a
quiet
voice
at
his
elbow
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
looked
in
to
see
how
you
are
after
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
I
am
,
Citizen
Lomaque
?
<EOS>
Petrified
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
You
yourself
took
charge
of
that
man
and
woman
for
me
,
in
the
waiting
-
room
,
yesterday
morning
;
and
as
for
myself
,
I
could
swear
to
having
read
their
names
at
the
grate
yesterday
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Yet
this
morning
here
are
no
such
things
as
these
said
names
to
be
found
in
the
list
!
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
think
,
"
interrupted
the
aggrieved
subordinate
,
"
of
his
having
the
impudence
to
bully
me
for
being
careless
in
chalking
the
doors
,
when
he
was
too
drunk
to
do
it
himself
?
<EOS>
too
drunk
to
know
his
right
hand
from
his
left
!
<EOS>
If
I
was
n't
the
best
-
natured
man
in
the
world
,
I
should
report
him
to
the
head
jailer
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Quite
right
of
you
to
excuse
him
,
and
quite
wrong
of
him
to
bully
you
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
persuasively
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
advice
,
"
he
continued
,
confidentially
,
to
the
hunchback
,
"
and
do
n't
trust
too
implicitly
to
that
slippery
memory
of
yours
,
after
our
little
drinking
bout
yesterday
.
<EOS>
You
could
not
really
have
read
their
names
at
the
grate
,
you
know
,
or
of
course
they
would
be
down
on
the
list
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
waiting
-
room
at
the
tribunal
,
a
word
in
your
ear
:
chief
agents
of
police
know
strange
secrets
.
<EOS>
The
president
of
the
court
condemns
and
pardons
in
public
;
but
there
is
somebody
else
,
with
the
power
of
ten
thousand
presidents
,
who
now
and
then
condemns
and
pardons
in
private
.
<EOS>
You
can
guess
who
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
more
,
except
that
I
recommend
you
to
keep
your
head
on
your
shoulders
,
by
troubling
it
about
nothing
but
the
list
there
in
your
hand
.
<EOS>
Stick
to
that
literally
,
and
nobody
can
blame
you
.
<EOS>
Make
a
fuss
about
mysteries
that
do
n't
concern
you
,
and
"
  
Lomaque
stopped
,
and
holding
his
hand
edgewise
,
let
it
drop
significantly
over
the
hunchback
's
head
.
<EOS>
That
action
and
the
hints
which
preceded
it
seemed
to
bewilder
the
little
man
more
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
stared
perplexedly
at
Lomaque
;
uttered
a
word
or
two
of
rough
apology
to
his
subordinate
,
and
rolling
his
misshapen
head
portentously
,
walked
away
with
the
death
-
list
crumpled
up
nervously
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
like
to
have
a
sight
of
them
,
and
see
if
they
really
are
the
same
man
and
woman
whom
I
looked
after
yesterday
morning
in
the
waiting
-
room
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
cell
door
,
just
as
the
deputy
-
jailer
was
about
to
close
it
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
in
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
doubt
you
will
find
that
drunken
booby
as
wrong
in
what
he
told
you
about
them
as
he
is
about
everything
else
.
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
made
use
of
the
privilege
granted
to
him
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
saw
Trudaine
sitting
with
his
sister
in
the
corner
of
the
cell
furthest
from
the
door
,
evidently
for
the
purpose
of
preventing
her
from
overhearing
the
conversation
outside
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
unsettled
look
,
however
,
in
her
eyes
,
a
slowly
-
heightening
color
in
her
cheeks
,
which
showed
her
to
be
at
least
vaguely
aware
that
something
unusual
had
been
taking
place
in
the
corridor
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
beckoned
to
Trudaine
to
leave
her
,
and
whispered
to
him
:
"
The
prescription
has
worked
well
.
<EOS>
You
are
safe
for
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Break
the
news
to
your
sister
as
gently
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
Danville
<EOS>
"
He
stopped
and
listened
till
he
satisfied
himself
,
by
the
sound
of
the
deputy
-
jailer
's
footsteps
,
that
the
man
was
lounging
toward
the
further
end
of
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
"
Danville
,
"
he
resumed
,
"
after
having
mixed
with
the
people
outside
the
grate
yesterday
,
and
having
heard
your
names
read
,
was
arrested
in
the
evening
by
secret
order
from
Robespierre
,
and
sent
to
the
Temple
.
<EOS>
What
charge
will
be
laid
to
him
,
or
when
he
will
be
brought
to
trial
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
he
is
arrested
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
do
n't
talk
now
;
my
friend
outside
is
coming
back
.
<EOS>
Keep
quiet
 
hope
everything
from
the
chances
and
changes
of
public
affairs
;
and
comfort
yourself
with
the
thought
that
you
are
both
safe
for
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
to
-
morrow
?
"
whispered
Trudaine
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
think
of
to
-
morrow
,
"
returned
Lomaque
,
turning
away
hurriedly
to
the
door
<EOS>
"
Let
to

take
care
of
itself

PART
THIRD

<EOS>
1
.
  
<EOS>
On
a
spring
morning
,
in
the
year
seventeen
hundred
and
ninety
-
eight
,
the
public
conveyance
then
running
between
Chalons
-
sur
-
Marne
and
Paris
sat
down
one
of
its
outside
passengers
at
the
first
post
-
station
beyond
Meaux
.
<EOS>
The
traveler
,
an
old
man
,
after
looking
about
him
hesitatingly
for
a
moment
or
two
,
betook
himself
to
a
little
inn
opposite
the
post
-
house
,
known
by
the
sign
of
the
Piebald
Horse
,
and
kept
by
the
Widow
Duval
 
<EOS>
a
woman
who
enjoyed
and
deserved
the
reputation
of
being
the
fastest
talker
and
the
best
maker
of
gibelotte
in
the
whole
locality
.
  
<EOS>
Although
the
traveler
was
carelessly
noticed
by
the
village
idlers
,
and
received
without
ceremony
by
the
Widow
Duval
,
he
was
by
no
means
so
ordinary
and
uninteresting
a
stranger
as
<EOS>
the
rustics
of
the
place
were
pleased
to
consider
him
.
<EOS>
The
time
had
been
when
this
quiet
,
elderly
,
unobtrusive
applicant
for
refreshment
at
the
Piebald
House
was
trusted
with
the
darkest
secrets
of
the
Reign
of
Terror
,
and
was
admitted
at
all
times
and
seasons
to
speak
face
to
face
with
Maximilian
Robespierre
himself
.
<EOS>
The
Widow
Duval
and
the
hangers
-
on
in
front
of
the
post
-
house
would
have
been
all
astonished
indeed
if
any
well
-
informed
personage
from
the
metropolis
had
been
present
to
tell
them
that
the
modest
old
traveler
with
the
shabby
little
carpet
-
bag
was
an
ex
-
chief
agent
of
the
secret
police
of
Paris
!
  
<EOS>
Between
three
and
four
years
had
elapsed
since
Lomaque
had
exercised
,
for
the
last
time
,
his
official
functions
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
His
shoulders
had
contracted
an
extra
stoop
,
and
his
hair
had
all
fallen
off
,
except
at
the
sides
and
back
of
his
head
.
<EOS>
In
some
other
respects
,
however
,
advancing
age
seemed
to
have
improved
rather
than
deteriorated
him
in
personal
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
complexion
looked
healthier
,
his
expression
cheerfuller
,
his
eyes
brighter
than
they
had
ever
been
of
late
years
.
<EOS>
He
walked
,
too
,
with
a
brisker
step
than
the
step
of
old
times
in
the
police
office
;
and
his
dress
,
although
it
certainly
did
not
look
like
the
costume
of
a
man
in
affluent
circumstances
,
was
cleaner
and
far
more
nearly
worn
than
ever
<EOS>
it
had
been
in
the
past
days
of
his
political
employment
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
He
sat
down
alone
in
the
inn
parlor
,
and
occupied
the
time
,
while
his
hostess
had
gone
to
fetch
the
half
-
bottle
of
wine
that
he
ordered
,
in
examining
a
dirty
old
card
which
he
extricated
from
a
mass
of
papers
in
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
which
bore
,
written
on
it
,
these
lines
:
  
"
When
the
troubles
are
over
,
do
not
forget
those
who
remember
you
with
eternal
gratitude
.
<EOS>
Stop
at
the
first
post
-
station
beyond
Meaux
,
on
the
high
-
road
to
Paris
,
and
ask
at
the
inn
for
Citizen
Maurice
,
whenever
you
wish
to
see
us
or
to
hear
of
us
again
.

"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray

inquired
Lomaque
,
putting
the
card
in
his
pocket
when
the
Widow
Duval
brought
in
the
wine
,
"

repeated
the

Of

such
excellent

I
supply

I
beg
pardon

only
be
so
kind
as

after

that
Satan
of
a

Robespierre
,
had
his
head
cut
off

<EOS>
"
She

She
did
n't

<EOS>
My
fowls
,
eggs
,
bread

butter
,
vegetables
,
and
wine
carried
her
through
 
always
in
combination
with
the
anxious
care
of
Citizen
Maurice
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
!
<EOS>
let
us
be
tenderly
conscientious
in
giving
credit
where
credit
is
due
;
let
us
never
forget
that
the
citizen
Maurice
contributed
something
to
the
cure
of
the
interesting
invalid
,
as
well
as
the
victuals
and
drink
from
the
Piebald
Horse
.
<EOS>
There
she
is
now
,
the
prettiest
little
woman
in
the
prettiest
little
cottage

Where
?
<EOS>
Will
you
be
so
obliging
as
to
tell
me

where
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
in
excellent
health
,
except
that
she
is
subject
now
and
then
to
nervous
attacks
;
having
evidently
,
as
I
believe
,
been
struck
with
some
dreadful
fright
 
most
likely
during
that
accursed
time
of
the
Terror

they
came
from
Paris
 
<EOS>
you
do
n't
drink

honest
man

Why
do
n't
you
drink
?
<EOS>
Very
,
very
pretty
in
a
pale
way
;
figure
perhaps
too
thin
 
<EOS>
let
me
pour
it
out
for
you
 
but
an
angel
of
gentleness
,
and
attached
in
such
a
touching
way
to
the
citizen
Maurice
"
  
"
Citizen
hostess
,
will
you
,

will
you
not
,
tell
me
where
they
live

<EOS>
"
You
droll
little
man
,
why
did
you
not
ask
me
that
before
,
if
you
wanted
to
know
?
<EOS>
Finish
your
wine
,
and
come
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
's
your
change
,
and
thank
you
for
your
custom
,
though
it
is

much

<EOS>
Come
to
the
door
,
I
say
,
and
do
n't
interrupt
me

<EOS>
You
're
an
old
man
 
<EOS>
can
you
see
forty
yards
before
you

<EOS>
Yes

you
can

<EOS>
Do
n't
be
peevish

that
never

anybody
any

Now
look
back

along

road

I

<EOS>
You

a

<EOS>
Good

<EOS>
On

side

there
is
a
little
path

you
ca
n't

that
,

you

remember
what
I
tell
you

<EOS>
Good
.
<EOS>
You
go
down
the
path
till
you
get
to
a
stream
;
down
the
stream
till
you
get
to
a
bridge
;
down
the
other
bank
of
the
stream
(
after
crossing
the
bridge
)
till
you
get
to
an
old
water
-
mill
 
<EOS>
a
jewel
of
a
water
-
mill
,
famous
for
miles
round
<EOS>
;
artists
from
the
four
quarters
of

are
always
coming

it

again

lead

Remember

"
  
<EOS>
Walking
as
fast
as
he
could
out
of
hearing
of
the
Widow
Duval
's
tongue
,
Lomaque
took
the
path
by
the
heap
of
stones
which
led
out
of
the
high
-
road
,
crossed
the
stream
,
and
arrived
at
the
old
water
-
mill
.
<EOS>
Close
by
it
stood
a
cottage
 
a
rough
,
simple
building
,
with
a
strip
of
garden
in
front
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
's
observant
eyes
marked
the
graceful
arrangement
of
the
flower
-
beds
,
and
the
delicate
whiteness
of
the
curtains
that
hung
behind
the
badly
-
glazed
narrow
windows
.
<EOS>
"
This
must
be
the
place
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
as
he
knocked
at
the
door
with
his
stick
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
see
the
traces
of
her
hand
before
I
cross
the
threshold
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
does
the
citizen
Maurice
"
Lomaque
began
,
not
seeing
clearly
,
for
the
first
moment
,
in
the
dark
little
passage
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
could
say
any
more
his
hand
was
grasped
,
his
carpet
-
bag
was
taken
from
him
,
and
a
well
-
known
voice
cried
,
"
Welcome
!
<EOS>
a
thousand
thousand
times
welcome
,
at
last
!
<EOS>
Citizen
Maurice
is
not
at
home
;
but
Louis
Trudaine
takes
his
place
,
and
is
overjoyed
to
see
once
more
the
best
and
dearest
of
his
friends
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hardly
know
you
again
.
<EOS>
How
you
are
altered
for
the
better
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Lomaque
,
as
they
entered
the
parlor
of
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
"
Remember
that
you
see
me
after
a
long
freedom
from
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Since
I
have
lived
here
,
I
have
gone
to
rest
at
night
,
and
have
not
been
afraid
of
the
morning
,
"
replied
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
He
went
out
into
the
passage
while
he
spoke
,
and
called
at
the
foot
of
the
one
flight
of
stairs
which
the
cottage
possessed
,
"
Rose
!
<EOS>
Rose
!
<EOS>
come
down
!
<EOS>
The
friend
whom
you
most
wished
to
see
has
arrived
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
answered
the
summons
immediately
.
<EOS>
The
frank
,
friendly
warmth
of
her
greeting
;
her
resolute
determination
,
after
the
first
inquiries
were
over
,
to
help
the
guest
to
take
off
his
upper
coat
with
her
own
hands
,
so
confused
and
delighted
Lomaque
,
that
he
hardly
knew
which
way
to
turn
,
or
what
to
say
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
even
more
trying
,
in
a
pleasant
way
,
to
a
lonely
old
fellow
like
me
,
"
he
was
about
to
add
,
"
than
the
unexpected
civility
of
the
hot
cup
of
coffee
years
ago
"
;
but
remembering
what
recollections
even
that
trifling
circumstance
might
recall
,
he
checked
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
More
trying
than
what
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Rose
,
leading
him
to
a
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
forget
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
my
dotage
already
!
"
<EOS>
he
answered
,
confusedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
got
used
just
yet
to
the
pleasure
of
seeing
your
kind
face
again
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
indeed
a
pleasure
to
look
at
that
face
now
,
after
Lomaque
's
last
experience
of
it
.
<EOS>
Three
years
of
repose
,
though
they
had
not
restored
to
Rose
those
youthful
attractions
which
she
had
lost
forever
in
the
days
of
the
Terror
,
had
not
passed
without
leaving
kindly
outward
traces
of
their
healing
progress
.
<EOS>
Though
the
girlish
roundness
had
not
returned
to
her
cheeks
,
or
the
girlish
delicacy
of
color
to
her
complexion
,
her
eyes
had
recovered
much
of
their
old
softness
,
and
her
expression
all
of
its
old
winning
charm
.
<EOS>
What
was
left
of
latent
sadness
in
her
face
,
and
of
significant
quietness
in
her
manner
,
remained
gently
and
harmlessly
 
remained
rather
to
show
what
had
been
once
than
what
was
now
.
  
<EOS>
When
they
were
all
seated
,
there
was
,
however
,
something
like
a
momentary
return
to
the
suspense
and
anxiety
of
past
days
in
their
faces
,
as
Trudaine
,
looking
earnestly
at
Lomaque
,
asked
,
"
Do
you
bring
any
news
from
Paris
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
"
he
replied
;
"
but
excellent
news
,
instead
,
from
Rouen
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
,
accidentally
,
through
the
employer
whom
I
have
been
serving
since
we
parted
,
that
your
old
house
by
the
river
-
side
is
to
let
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Rose
started
from
her
chair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Louis
,
if
we
could
only
live
there
once
more
!
<EOS>
My
flower
-
garden
?
<EOS>
"
she
continued
to
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
Cultivated
throughout
,
"
he
answered
,
"
by
the
late
proprietor
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
laboratory
?
"
added
her
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Left
standing
,
"
said
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
letter
with
all
the
particulars
.
<EOS>
You
may
depend
upon
them
,
for
the
writer
<EOS>
is
the
person
charged
with
the
letting
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Trudaine
looked
over
the
letter
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
price
is
not
beyond
our
means
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
After
our
three
years
'
economy
here
,
we
can
afford
to
give
something
for
a
great
pleasure
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
what
a
day
of
happiness
it
will
be
when
we
go
home
again
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rose
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
write
to
your
friend
at
once
,
"
she
added
,
addressing
Lomaque
,
"
and
say
we
take
the
house
,
before
any
one
else
is
beforehand
with
us
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
nodded
,
and
folding
up
the
letter
mechanically
in
the
old
official
form
,
made
a
note
on
it
in
the
old
official
manner
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
observed
the
action
,
and
felt
its
association
with
past
times
of
trouble
and
terror
.
<EOS>
His
face
grew
grave
again
as
he
said
to
Lomaque
,
"
And
is
this
good
news
really
all
the
news
of
importance
you
have
to
tell
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
hesitated
,
and
fidgeted
in
his
chair
.
<EOS>
"
What
other
news
I
have
will
bear
keeping
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
many
questions
I
should
like
to
ask
first
,
about
your
sister
and
yourself
.
<EOS>
Do
you
mind
allowing
me
to
refer
for
a
moment
to
the
time
when
we
last
met
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
addressed
this
inquiry
to
Rose
,
who
answered
in
the
negative
;
but
her
voice
seemed
to
falter
,
even
in
saying
the
one
word
"
No
.
"
<EOS>
She
turned
her
head
away
when
she
spoke
;
and
Lomaque
noticed
that
her
hands
trembled
as
she
took
up
some
work
lying
on
a
table
near
,
and
hurriedly
occupied
herself
with
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
speak
as
little
about
that
time
as
possible
,
"
said
Trudaine
,
looking
significantly
toward
his
sister
;
"
but
we
have
some
questions
to
ask
you
in
our
turn
;
so
the
allusion
,
for
this
once
,
is
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Your
sudden
disappearance
at
the
very
crisis
of
that
time
of
danger
has
not
yet
been
fully
explained
to
us
.
<EOS>
The
one
short
note
which
you
left
behind
<EOS>
you
helped
us
to
guess
at
what
had
happened
rather
than
to
understand
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
easily
explain
it
now
,
"
answered
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sudden
overthrow
of
the
Reign
of
Terror
,
which
was
salvation
to
you
,
was
destruction
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
new
republican
reign
was
a
reign
of
mercy
,
except
for
the
tail
of
Robespierre
,
as
the
phrase
ran
then
.
<EOS>
Every
man
who
had
been
so
wicked
or
so
unfortunate
as
to
be
involved
,
even
in
the
meanest
capacity
,
with
the
machinery
of
the
government
of
Terror
,
was
threatened
,
and
justly
,
with
the
fate
of
Robespierre
.
<EOS>
I
,
among
others
,
fell
under
this
menace
of
death
.
<EOS>
I
deserved
to
die
,
and
should
have
resigned
myself
to
the
guillotine
but
for
you
.
<EOS>
From
the
course
taken
by
public
events
,
I
knew
you
would
be
saved
;
and
although
your
safety
was
the
work
of
circumstances
,
still
I
had
a
hand
in
rendering
it
possible
at
the
outset
;
and
a
yearning
came
over
me
to
behold
you
both
free
again
with
my
own
eyes
 
a
selfish
yearning
to
see
in
you
a
living
,
breathing
,
real
result
of
the
one
good
impulse
of
my
heart
,
which
I
could
look
back
on
with
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
This
desire
gave
me
a
new
interest
in
life
.
<EOS>
I
resolved
to
escape
death
if
it
were
possible
.
<EOS>
For
ten
days
I
lay
hidden
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
After
that
 
thanks
to
certain
scraps
of
useful
knowledge
which
my
experience
in
the
office
of
secret
police
had
given
me
 
I
succeeded
in
getting
clear
of
Paris
and
in
making
my
way
safely
to
Switzerland
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
my
story
is
so
short
and
so
soon
told
that
I
may
as
well
get
it
over
at
once
.
<EOS>
The
only
relation
I
knew
of
in
the
world
to
apply
to
was
a
cousin
of
mine
(
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
)
,
established
as
a
silk
-
mercer
at
Berne
.
<EOS>
I
threw
myself
on
this
man
's
mercy
.
<EOS>
He
discovered
that
I
was
likely
,
with
my
business
habits
,
to
be
of
some
use
to
him
,
and
he
took
me
into
his
house
.
<EOS>
I
worked
for
what
he
pleased
to
give
me
,
traveled
about
for
him
in
Switzerland
,
deserved
his
confidence
,
and
won
it
.
<EOS>
Till
within
the
last
few
months
I
remained
with
him
;
and
only
left
my
employment
to
enter
,
by
my
master
's
own
desire
,
the
house
of
his
brother
,
established
also
as
a
silk
-
mercer
,
at
Chalons
-
sur
-
Marne
.
<EOS>
In
the
counting
-
house
of
this
merchant
I
am
corresponding
clerk
,
and
am
only
able
to
come
and
see
you
now
by
offering
to
undertake
a
special
business
mission
for
my
employer
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
It
is
drudgery
,
at
my
time
of
life
,
after
all
I
have
gone
through
 
but
my
hard
work
is
innocent
work
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
obliged
to
cringe
for
every
crown
-
piece
I
put
in
my
pocket
 
not
bound
to
denounce
,
deceive
,
and
dog
to
death
other
men
,
before
I
can
earn
my
bread
,
and
scrape
together
money
enough
to
bury
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
ending
a
bad
,
base
life
harmlessly
at
last
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
poor
thing
to
do
,
but
it
is
something
done
 
and
even
that
contents
a
man
at
my
age
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
am
happier
than
I
used
to
be
,
or
at
least
less
ashamed
when
I
look
people
like
you
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Rose
,
laying
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
allow
you
to
talk
of
yourself
in
that
way
,
even
in
jest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
speaking
in
earnest
,
"
answered
Lomaque
,
quietly
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
wo
n't
weary
you
with
any
more
words
about
myself
.
<EOS>
My
story
is
told
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
All
?
"
asked
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
He
looked
searchingly
,
almost
suspiciously
,
at
Lomaque
,
as
he
put
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
All
?
"
he
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Yours
is
a
short
story
,
indeed
,
my
good
friend
!
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
have
forgotten
some
of
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Again
Lomaque
fidgeted
and
hesitated
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
not
a
little
hard
on
an
old
man
to
be
always
asking
questions
of
him
,
and
never
answering
one
of
his
inquiries
in
return
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
Rose
,
very
gayly
as
to
manner
,
but
rather
uneasily
as
to
look
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
speak
out
till
we
two
are
alone
,
"
thought
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
best
to
risk
nothing
,
and
to
humor
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
"
he
said
aloud
;
"
no
grumbling
.
<EOS>
I
admit
that
it
is
your
turn
to
hear
our
story
now
;
and
I
will
do
my
best
to
gratify
you
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
begin
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
his
sister
,
"
let
me
suggest
,
Rose
,
that
if
you
have
any
household
matters
to
settle
upstairs
"
  
"
I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
she
interrupted
,
hurriedly
,
taking
up
the
work
which
,
during
the
last
few
minutes
,
she
had
allowed
to
drop
into
her
lap
;
"
but
I
am
stronger
than
you
think
;
I
can
face
the
worst
of
our
recollections
composedly
.
<EOS>
Go
on
,
Louis
;
pray
go
on
 
<EOS>
I
am
quite
fit
to
stop
and
hear
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
know
what
we
suffered
in
the
first
days
of
our
suspense
,
after
the
success
of
your
stratagem
,
"
said
Trudaine
,
turning
to
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
was
on
the
evening
after
we
had
seen
you
for
the
last
time
at
St.
Lazare
that
strange
,
confused
rumors
of
an
impending
convulsion
in
Paris
first
penetrated
within
our
prison
walls
.
<EOS>
During
the
next
few
days
the
faces
of
our
jailers
were
enough
to
show
us
that
those
rumors
were
true
,
and
that
the
Reign
of
Terror
was
actually
threatened
with
overthrow
at
the
hands
of
the
Moderate
Party
.
<EOS>
We
had
hardly
time
to
hope
everything
from
this
blessed
change
before
the
tremendous
news
of
Robespierre
's
attempted
suicide
,
then
of
his
condemnation
and
execution
,
reached
us
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
produced
in
the
prison
was
beyond
all
description
.
<EOS>
The
accused
who
had
been
tried
and
the
accused
who
had
not
been
tried
got
mingled
together
.
<EOS>
From
the
day
of
Robespierre
's
arrest
,
no
orders
came
to
the
authorities
,
no
death
-
lists
reached
the
prison
.
<EOS>
The
jailers
,
terrified
by
rumors
that
the
lowest
accomplices
of
the
tyrant
would
be
held
responsible
,
and
be
condemned
with
him
,
made
no
attempt
to
maintain
order
.
<EOS>
Some
of
them
 
that
hunchback
man
among
the
rest
 
deserted
their
duties
altogether
.
<EOS>
The
disorganization
was
so
complete
,
that
when
the
commissioners
from
the
new
Government
came
to
St.
Lazare
,
some
of
us
were
actually
half
starving
from
want
of
the
bare
necessities
of
life
.
<EOS>
To
inquire
separately
into
our
cases
was
found
to
be
impossible
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
necessary
papers
were
lost
;
sometimes
what
documents
remained
were
incomprehensible
to
the
new
commissioners
.
<EOS>
They
were
obliged
,
at
last
,
to
make
short
work
of
it
by
calling
us
up
before
them
in
dozens
.
<EOS>
Tried
or
not
tried
,
we
had
all
been
arrested
by
the
tyrant
,
had
all
been
accused
of
conspiracy
against
him
,
and
were
all
ready
to
hail
the
new
Government
as
the
salvation
of
France
.
<EOS>
In
nine
cases
out
of
ten
,
our
best
claim
to
be
discharged
was
derived
from
these
circumstances
.
<EOS>
We
were
trusted
by
Tallien
and
the
men
of
the
Ninth
Thermidor
,
because
we
had
been
suspected
by
Robespierre
,
Couthon
,
and
St.
Just
.
<EOS>
Arrested
informally
,
we
were
now
liberated
informally
.
<EOS>
When
it
came
to
my
sister
's
turn
and
mine
,
we
were
not
under
examination
five
minutes
.
<EOS>
No
such
thing
as
a
searching
question
was
asked
of
us
;
I
believe
we
might
even
have
given
our
own
names
with
perfect
impunity
.
<EOS>
But
I
had
previously
instructed
Rose
that
we
were
to
assume
our
mother
's
maiden
name
 
Maurice
.
<EOS>
As
the
citizen
and
citoyenne
Maurice
,
accordingly
,
we
passed
out
of
prison
 
under
the
same
name
we
have
lived
ever
since
in
hiding
here
.
<EOS>
Our
past
repose
has
depended
,
our
future
happiness
will
depend
,
on
our
escape
from
death
being
kept
the
profoundest
secret
among
us
three
.
<EOS>
For
one
all
sufficient
reason
,
which
you
can
easily
guess
at
,
the
brother
and
sister
Maurice
must
still
know
nothing
of
Louis
Trudaine
and
Rose
Danville
,
except
that
they
were
two
among
the
hundreds
of
victims
guillotined
during
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
spoke
the
last
sentence
with
a
faint
smile
,
and
with
the
air
of
a
man
trying
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
to
treat
a
grave
subject
lightly
.
<EOS>
His
face
clouded
again
,
however
,
in
a
moment
,
when
he
looked
toward
his
sister
,
as
he
ceased
.
<EOS>
Her
work
had
once
more
dropped
on
her
lap
,
her
face
was
turned
away
so
that
he
could
not
see
it
;
but
he
knew
by
the
trembling
of
her
clasped
hands
,
as
they
rested
on
her
knee
,
and
by
the
slight
swelling
of
the
veins
on
her
neck
which
she
could
not
hide
from
him
,
that
her
boasted
strength
of
nerve
had
deserted
her
.
<EOS>
Three
years
of
repose
had
not
yet
enabled
her
to
hear
her
marriage
name
uttered
,
or
to
be
present
when
past
times
of
deathly
suffering
and
terror
were
referred
to
,
without
betraying
the
shock
in
her
face
and
manner
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
looked
saddened
,
but
in
no
way
surprised
by
what
he
saw
.
<EOS>
Making
a
sign
to
Lomaque
to
say
nothing
,
he
rose
and
took
up
his
sister
's
hood
,
which
lay
on
a
window
-
seat
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
Rose
,
"
he
said
,
"
the
sun
is
shining
,
the
sweet
spring
air
is
inviting
us
out
.
<EOS>
Let
us
have
a
quiet
stroll
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Why
should
we
keep
our
good
friend
here
cooped
up
in
this
narrow
little
room
,
when
we
have
miles
and
miles
of
beautiful
landscape
to
show
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
threshold
?
<EOS>
Come
,
it
is
high
treason
to
Queen
Nature
to
remain
indoors
on
such
a
morning
as
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
her
to
reply
,
he
put
on
her
hood
,
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
and
led
the
way
out
.
<EOS>
Lomaque
's
face
grew
grave
as
he
followed
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
I
only
showed
the
bright
side
of
my
budget
of
news
in
her
presence
,
"
thought
he
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
is
not
well
at
heart
yet
.
<EOS>
I
might
have
hurt
her
,
poor
thing
!
<EOS>
I
might
have
hurt
her
again
sadly
,
if
I
had
not
held
my
tongue
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
walked
for
a
little
while
down
the
banks
of
the
stream
,
talking
of
indifferent
matters
;
then
returned
to
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
Rose
had
recovered
her
spirits
,
and
could
listen
with
interest
and
amusement
to
Lomaque
's
dryly
-
humorous
description
of
his
life
as
a
clerk
at
Chalons
-
sur
-
Marne
.
<EOS>
They
parted
for
a
little
while
at
the
cottage
door
.
<EOS>
Rose
retired
to
the
upstairs
room
from
which
she
had
been
summoned
by
her
brother
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
and
Lomaque
returned
to
wander
again
along
the
banks
of
the
stream
.
  
<EOS>
With
one
accord
,
and
without
a
word
passing
between
them
,
they
left
the
neighborhood
of
the
cottage
hurriedly
;
then
stopped
on
a
sudden
,
and
attentively
looked
each
other
in
the
face
 
looked
in
silence
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
Trudaine
spoke
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
having
spared
her
,
"
he
began
,
abruptly
.
"
<EOS>
She
is
not
strong
enough
yet
to
bear
hearing
of
a
new
misfortune
,
unless
I
break
the
tidings
to
her
first
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
suspect
me
,
then
,
of
bringing
bad
news
?
"
said
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
do
.
<EOS>
When
I
saw
your
first
look
at
her
,
after
we
were
all
seated
in
the
cottage
parlor
,
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
Speak
without
fear
,
without
caution
,
without
one
useless
word
of
preface
.
<EOS>
After
three
years
of
repose
,
if
it
pleases
God
to
afflict
us
again
,
I
can
bear
the
trial
calmly
;
and
,
if
need
be
,
can
strengthen
her
to
bear
it
calmly
,
too
.
<EOS>
I
say
again
,
Lomaque
,
speak
at
once
,
and
speak
out
!
<EOS>
I
know
your
news
is
bad
,
for
I
know
beforehand
that
it
is
news
of
Danville
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
right
;
my
bad
news
is
news
of
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
discovered
the
secret
of
our
escape
from
the
guillotine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
 
he
has
not
a
suspicion
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
believes
 
as
his
mother
,
as
every
one
does
 
that
you
were
both
executed
the
day
after
the
Revolutionary
Tribunal
sentenced
you
to
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Lomaque
,
you
speak
positively
of
that
belief
of
his
 
<EOS>
but
you
can
not
be
certain
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
,
on
the
most
indisputable
,
the
most
startling
evidence
 
on
the
authority
of
Danville
's
own
act
.
<EOS>
You
have
asked
me
to
speak
out
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
again
 
I
insist
on
it
!
<EOS>
Your
news
,
Lomaque
 
your
news
,
without
another
word
of
preface
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
without
another
word
of
preface
.
<EOS>
Danville
is
on
the
point
of
being
married
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
answer
was
given
they
both
stopped
by
the
bank
of
the
stream
,
and
again
looked
each
other
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
minute
of
dead
silence
between
them
.
<EOS>
During
that
minute
,
the
water
bubbling
by
happily
over
its
bed
of
pebbles
seemed
strangely
loud
,
the
singing
of
birds
in
a
little
wood
by
the
stream
-
side
strangely
near
and
shrill
,
in
both
their
ears
.
<EOS>
The
light
breeze
,
for
all
its
midday
warmth
,
touched
their
cheeks
coldly
;
and
the
spring
sunlight
pouring
on
their
faces
felt
as
if
it
were
glimmering
on
them
through
winter
clouds
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
us
walk
on
,
"
said
Trudaine
,
in
a
low
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
prepared
for
bad
news
,
yet
not
for
that
.
<EOS>
Are
you
certain
of
what
you
have
just
told
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
As
certain
as
that
the
stream
here
is
flowing
by
our
side
.
<EOS>
Hear
how
I
made
the
discovery
,
and
you
will
doubt
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Before
last
week
I
knew
nothing
of
Danville
,
except
that
his
arrest
on
suspicion
by
Robespierre
's
order
was
,
as
events
turned
out
,
the
saving
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
was
imprisoned
,
as
I
told
you
,
on
the
evening
after
he
had
heard
your
names
read
from
the
death
-
list
at
the
prison
grate
.
<EOS>
He
remained
in
confinement
at
the
Temple
,
unnoticed
in
the
political
confusion
out
-
of
-
doors
,
just
as
you
remained
unnoticed
at
St.
Lazare
,
and
he
profited
precisely
in
the
same
manner
that
you
profited
by
the
timely
insurrection
which
overthrew
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
<EOS>
I
knew
this
,
and
I
knew
that
he
walked
out
of
prison
in
the
character
of
a
persecuted
victim
of
Robespierre
's
 
and
,
for
better
than
three
years
past
,
I
knew
no
more
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
.
<EOS>
Last
week
I
happened
to
be
waiting
in
the
shop
of
my
employer
,
Citizen
Clairfait
,
for
some
papers
to
take
into
the
counting
-
house
,
when
an
old
man
enters
with
a
sealed
parcel
,
which
he
hands
to
one
of
the
shopmen
,
saying
:
  
"
"
Give
that
to
Citizen
Clairfait
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Any
name
?
"
says
the
shopman
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
The
name
is
of
no
consequence
,
"
answers
the
old
man
;
"
but
if
you
please
,
you
can
give
mine
.
<EOS>
Say
the
parcel
came
from
Citizen
Dubois
;
"
and
then
he
goes
out
.
<EOS>
His
name
,
in
connection
with
his
elderly
look
,
strikes
me
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Does
that
old
fellow
live
at
Chalons
?
<EOS>
"
I
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
No
,
"
says
the
shopman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
here
in
attendance
on
a
customer
of
ours
 
an
old
ex
-
aristocrat
named
Danville
.
<EOS>
She
is
on
a
visit
in
our
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
leave
you
to
imagine
how
that
reply
startles
and
amazes
me
.
<EOS>
The
shopman
can
answer
none
of
the
other
questions
I
put
to
him
;
but
the
next
day
I
am
asked
to
dinner
by
my
employer
(
who
,
for
his
brother
's
sake
,
shows
me
the
utmost
civility
)
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
room
,
I
find
his
daughter
just
putting
away
a
lavender
-
colored
silk
scarf
,
on
which
she
has
been
embroidering
in
silver
<EOS>
what
looks
to
me
very
like
a
crest
and
coat
-
of
-
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
I
do
n't
mind
your
seeing
what
I
am
about
,
Citizen
Lomaque
,
"
says
she
;
"
for
I
know
my
father
can
trust
you
.
<EOS>
That
scarf
is
sent
back
to
us
by
the
purchaser
,
an
ex
-
emigrant
lady
of
the
old
aristocratic
school
,
to
have
her
family
coat
-
of
-
arms
embroidered
on
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Rather
a
dangerous
commission
even
in
these
mercifully
democratic
times
,
is
it
not
?
"
says
I.
  
"
"
<EOS>
The
old
lady
<EOS>
,
you
must
know
,
"
says
she
,
"
is
as
proud
as
Lucifer
;
and
having
got
back
safely
to
France
in
these
days
of
moderate
republicanism
,
thinks
she
may
now
indulge
with
impunity
in
all
her
old
-
fashioned
notions
.
<EOS>
She
has
been
an
excellent
customer
of
ours
,
so
my
father
thought
it
best
to
humor
her
,
without
,
however
,
trusting
her
commission
to
any
of
the
workroom
women
to
execute
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
living
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
now
,
certainly
;
still
there
is
nothing
like
being
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Nothing
,
"
I
answer
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
what
is
this
ex
-
emigrant
's
name
?
"
  
"
"
Danville
,
"
replies
the
citoyenne
Clairfait
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
going
to
appear
in
that
fine
scarf
at
her
son
's
marriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
"
Marriage
!
"
<EOS>
I
exclaim
,
perfectly
thunderstruck
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
Yes
,
"
says
she
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
is
there
so
amazing
in
that
?
<EOS>
By
all
accounts
,
the
son
,
poor
man
,
deserves
to
make
a
lucky
marriage
this
time
.
<EOS>
His
first
wife
was
taken
away
from
him
in
the
Reign
of
Terror
by
the
guillotine
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
"
Who
is
he
going
to
marry
?
<EOS>
"
I
inquire
,
still
breathless
.
  
<EOS>
"
"
The
daughter
of
General
Berthelin
 
an
ex
-
aristocrat
by
family
,
like
the
old
lady
;
but
by
principle
as
good
a
republican
as
ever
lived
 
a
hard
-
drinking
,
loud
-
swearing
,
big
-
whiskered
old
soldier
,
who
snaps
his
fingers
at
his
ancestors
and
says
we
are
all
descended
from
Adam
,
the
first
genuine
sans
-
culotte
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
this
way
the
citoyenne
Ciairfait
gossips
on
all
dinner
-
time
,
but
says
nothing
more
of
any
importance
.
<EOS>
I
,
with
my
old
police
-
office
habits
,
set
to
the
next
day
,
and
try
to
make
some
discoveries
for
myself
.
<EOS>
The
sum
of
what
I
find
out
is
this
:
Danville
's
mother
is
staying
with
General
Berthelin
's
sister
and
daughter
at
Chalons
,
and
Danville
himself
is
expected
to
arrive
every
day
to
escort
them
all
three
to
Paris
,
where
the
marriage
-
contract
is
to
be
signed
at
the
general
's
house
.
<EOS>
Discovering
this
,
and
seeing
that
prompt
action
is
now
of
the
most
vital
importance
,
I
undertake
,
as
I
told
you
,
my
employer
's
commission
for
Paris
,
depart
with
all
speed
,
and
stop
here
on
my
way
.
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
done
yet
.
<EOS>
All
the
haste
I
can
make
is
not
haste
enough
to
give
me
a
good
start
of
the
wedding
party
.
<EOS>
On
my
road
here
,
the
diligence
by
which
I
travel
is
passed
by
a
carriage
,
posting
along
at
full
speed
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
see
inside
that
carriage
;
but
I
look
at
the
box
-
seat
,
and
recognize
on
it
the
old
man
Dubois
.
<EOS>
He
whirls
by
in
a
cloud
of
dust
,
but
I
am
certain
of
him
;
and
I
say
to
myself
what
I
now
say
again
to
you
,
<EOS>
no
time
is
to
be
lost
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
time
shall
be
lost
,
"
answers
,
Trudaine
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
Three
years
have
passed
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
lower
voice
,
speaking
to
himself
rather
than
to
Lomaque
;
"
three
years
since
the
day
when
I
led
my
sister
out
of
the
gates
of
the
prison
 
three
years
since
I
said
in
my
heart
,
"
I
will
be
patient
,
and
will
not
seek
to
avenge
myself
.
<EOS>
Our
wrongs
cry
from
earth
to
heaven
;
from
man
who
inflicts
to
God
who
redresses
.
<EOS>
When
the
day
of
reckoning
comes
,
let
it
be
the
day
of
his
vengeance
,
not
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
In
my
heart
I
said
those
words
 
I
have
been
true
to
them
 
<EOS>
I
have
waited
.
<EOS>
The
day
has
come
,
and
the
duty
it
demands
of
me
shall
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
moment
's
silence
before
Lomaque
spoke
again
.
"
<EOS>
Your
sister
?
<EOS>
"
he
began
,
hesitatingly
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
there
only
that
my
purpose
falters
,
"
said
the
other
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
were
but
possible
to
spare
her
all
knowledge
of
this
last
trial
,
and
to
leave
the
accomplishment
of
the
terrible
task
to
me
alone
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
it
is
possible
,
"
interposed
Lomaque
.
"
<EOS>
Listen
to
what
I
advise
.
<EOS>
We
must
depart
for
Paris
by
the
diligence
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
we
must
take
your
sister
with
us
 
to
-
morrow
will
be
time
enough
;
people
do
n't
sign
marriage
-
contracts
on
the
evening
after
a
long
day
's
journey
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
then
,
and
we
must
take
your
sister
.
<EOS>
Leave
the
care
of
her
in
Paris
,
and
the
responsibility
of
keeping
her
in
ignorance
of
what
you
are
doing
,
to
me
.
<EOS>
Go
to
this
General
Berthelin
's
house
at
a
time
when
you
know
Danville
is
there
<EOS>
(
we
can
get
that
knowledge
through
the
servants
)
;
confront
him
without
a
moment
's
previous
warning
;
confront
him
as
a
man
risen
from
the
dead
;
confront
him
before
every
soul
in
the
room
though
the
room
should
be
full
of
people
 
and
leave
the
rest
to
the
self
-
betrayal
of
a
panic
-
stricken
man
.
<EOS>
Say
but
three
words
,
and
your
duty
will
be
done
;
you
may
return
to
your
sister
,
and
may
depart
with
her
in
safety
to
your
old
retreat
at
Rouen
,
or
where
else
you
please
,
on
the
very
day
when
you
have
put
it
out
of
her
infamous
husband
's
power
to
add
another
to
the
list
of
his
crimes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
forget
the
suddenness
of
the
journey
to
Paris
,
"
said
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
How
are
we
to
account
for
it
without
the
risk
of
awakening
my
sister
's
suspicions
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Trust
that
to
me
,
"
answered
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
return
to
the
cottage
at
once
.
<EOS>
No
,
not
you
,
"
he
added
,
suddenly
,
as
they
turned
to
retrace
their
steps
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
is
that
in
your
face
which
would
betray
us
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
to
go
back
alone
 
<EOS>
I
will
say
that
you
have
gone
to
give
some
orders
at
the
inn
.
<EOS>
Let
us
separate
immediately
.
<EOS>
You
will
recover
your
self
-
possession
 
you
will
get
to
look
yourself
again
sooner
 
if
you
are
left
alone
.
<EOS>
I
know
enough
of
you
to
know
that
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
waste
another
minute
in
explanations
;
even
minutes
are
precious
to
us
on
such
a
day
as
this
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
you
are
fit
to
meet
your
sister
again
,
I
shall
have
had
time
to
say
all
I
wish
to
her
,
and
shall
be
waiting
at
the
cottage
to
tell
you
the
result
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
Trudaine
,
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
brighten
again
with
something
of
the
old
energy
and
sudden
decision
of
the
days
when
he
was
a
man
in
office
under
the
Reign
of
Terror
.
"
<EOS>
Leave
it
to
me
,
"
he
said
;
and
,
waving
his
hand
,
turned
away
quickly
in
the
direction
of
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Nearly
an
hour
passed
before
Trudaine
ventured
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
at
length
entered
the
path
which
led
to
the
garden
gate
,
he
saw
his
sister
waiting
at
the
cottage
door
.
<EOS>
Her
face
looked
unusually
animated
;
and
she
ran
forward
a
step
or
two
to
meet
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Louis
!
"
<EOS>
she
said
,
"
I
have
a
confession
to
make
,
and
I
must
beg
you
to
hear
it
patiently
to
the
end
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
know
that
our
good
Lomaque
,
though
he
came
in
tired
from
his
walk
,
occupied
himself
the
first
thing
,
at
my
request
,
in
writing
the
letter
which
is
to
secure
to
us
our
dear
old
home
by
the
banks
of
the
Seine
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
he
looked
at
me
,
and
said
,
"
I
should
like
to
be
present
at
your
happy
return
to
the
house
where
I
first
saw
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
come
,
come
with
us
!
"
<EOS>
I
said
directly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
not
an
independent
man
,
"
he
answered
;
"
I
have
a
margin
of
time
allowed
me
at
Paris
,
certainly
,
but
it
is
not
long
 
if
I
were
only
my
own
master
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
stopped
.
<EOS>
Louis
,
I
remembered
all
we
owed
to
him
;
I
remembered
that
there
was
no
sacrifice
we
ought
not
to
be
too
glad
to
make
for
his
sake
;
I
felt
the
kindness
of
the
wish
he
had
expressed
;
and
perhaps
I
was
a
little
influenced
by
my
own
impatience
to
see
once
more
my
flower
-
garden
and
the
rooms
where
we
used
to
be
so
happy
.
<EOS>
So
I
said
to
him
,
"
I
am
sure
Louis
will
agree
with
me
that
our
time
is
yours
,
and
that
we
shall
be
only
too
glad
to
advance
our
departure
so
as
to
make
traveling
leisure
enough
for
you
to
come
with
us
to
Rouen
.
<EOS>
We
should
be
worse
than
ungrateful
<EOS>
"
He
stopped
me
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
always
been
good
to
me
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
not
impose
on
your
kindness
now
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
you
have
formalities
to
settle
before
you
can
leave
this
place
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
one
,
"
I
said
 
for
we
have
not
,
as
you
know
,
Louis
?
<EOS>
"
Why
,
here
is
your
furniture
to
begin
with
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
A
few
chairs
and
tables
hired
from
the
inn
,
"
I
answered
;
"
we
have
only
to
give
the
landlady
our
key
,
to
leave
a
letter
for
the
owner
of
the
cottage
,
and
then
"
He
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
to
hear
you
talk
,
one
would
think
you
were
as
ready
to
travel
as
I
am
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
So
we
are
,
"
I
said
,
"
quite
as
ready
,
living
in
the
way
we
do
here
.
"
<EOS>
He
shook
his
head
;
but
you
will
not
shake
yours
,
Louis
,
I
am
sure
,
now
you
have
heard
all
my
long
story
?
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
blame
me
can
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Trudaine
could
answer
,
Lomaque
looked
out
of
the
cottage
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
been
telling
my
brother
every
thing
,
"
said
Rose
,
turning
round
toward
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
he
say
?
"
asked
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
says
what
I
say
,
"
replied
Rose
,
answering
for
her
brother
;
"
that
our
time
is
your
time
 
the
time
of
our
best
and
dearest
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
it
be
done
,
then
?
"
asked
Lomaque
,
with
a
meaning
look
at
Trudaine
.
  
<EOS>
Rose
glanced
anxiously
at
her
brother
;
his
face
was
much
graver
than
she
had
expected
to
see
it
,
but
his
answer
relieved
her
from
all
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
quite
right
,
love
,
to
speak
as
you
did
,
"
he
said
,
gently
.
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
Lomaque
,
he
added
,
in
a
firmer
voice
,
"
It
shall
be
done
!
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
Two
days
after
the
traveling
-
carriage
described
by
Lomaque
had
passed
the
diligence
on
the
road
to
Paris
,
Madame
Danville
sat
in
the
drawing
-
room
of
an
apartment
in
the
Rue
de
Grenelle
,
handsomely
dressed
for
driving
out
.
<EOS>
After
consulting
a
large
gold
watch
that
hung
at
her
side
,
and
finding
that
it
wanted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
only
to
two
o'clock
,
she
rang
her
hand
-
bell
,
and
said
to
the
maid
-
servant
who
answered
the
summons
,
"
I
have
five
minutes
to
spare
.
<EOS>
Send
Dubois
here
with
my
chocolate
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
made
his
appearance
with
great
alacrity
.
<EOS>
After
handing
the
cup
of
chocolate
to
his
mistress
,
he
ventured
to
use
the
privilege
of
talking
,
to
which
his
long
and
faithful
services
entitled
him
,
and
paid
the
old
lady
a
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
madame
looking
so
young
and
in
such
good
spirits
this
morning
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
low
bow
and
a
mild
,
deferential
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
some
reason
for
being
in
good
spirits
on
the
day
when
my
son
's
marriage
-
contract
is
to
be
signed
,
"
said
Madame
Danville
,
with
a
gracious
nod
of
the
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
,
Dubois
,
I
shall
live
yet
to
see
him
with
a
patent
of
nobility
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
mob
has
done
its
worst
;
the
end
of
this
infamous
revolution
is
not
far
off
;
our
order
will
have
its
turn
again
soon
,
and
then
who
will
have
such
a
chance
at
court
as
my
son
?
<EOS>
He
is
noble
already
through
his
mother
,
he
will
then
be
noble
also
through
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
;
let
that
coarse
-
mannered
,
passionate
,
old
soldier
-
father
of
hers
be
as
unnaturally
republican
as
he
pleases
,
he
has
inherited
a
name
which
will
help
my
son
to
a
peerage
!
<EOS>
The
Vicomte
D'Anville
(
D
with
an
apostrophe
,
Dubois
,
you
understand
?
)
,
the
Vicomte
D'Anville
 
<EOS>
how
prettily
it
sounds
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Charmingly
,
madame
 
charmingly
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
this
second
marriage
of
my
young
master
's
begins
under
much
better
auspices
than
the
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
remark
was
an
unfortunate
one
.
<EOS>
Madame
Danville
frowned
portentously
,
and
rose
in
a
great
hurry
from
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
your
wits
failing
you
,
you
old
fool
?
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
by
referring
to
such
a
subject
as
that
,
on
this
day
,
of
all
others
?
<EOS>
You
are
always
harping
on
those
two
wretched
people
who
were
guillotined
,
as
if
you
thought
I
could
have
saved
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Were
you
not
present
when
my
son
and
I
met
,
after
the
time
of
the
Terror
?
<EOS>
Did
you
not
hear
my
first
words
to
him
,
when
he
told
me
of
the
catastrophe
?
<EOS>
Were
they
not
<EOS>
"
Charles
,
I
love
you
;
but
if
I
thought
you
had
let
those
two
unfortunates
,
who
risked
themselves
to
save
me
,
die
without
risking
your
life
in
return
to
save
them
,
I
would
break
my
heart
rather
than
ever
look
at
you
or
speak
to
you
again
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
I
not
say
that
?
<EOS>
And
did
he
not
answer
,
"
Mother
,
my
life
was
risked
for
them
.
<EOS>
I
proved
my
devotion
by
exposing
myself
to
arrest
 
<EOS>
I
was
imprisoned
for
my
exertions
 
<EOS>
and
then
I
could
do
no
more
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
you
not
stand
by
and
hear
him
give
that
answer
,
overwhelmed
while
he
spoke
by
generous
emotion
?
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
that
he
really
was
imprisoned
in
the
Temple
?
<EOS>
Do
you
dare
to
think
that
we
are
to
blame
after
that
?
<EOS>
I
owe
you
much
,
Dubois
,
but
if
you
are
to
take
liberties
with
me
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
madame
!
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
a
thousand
times
.
<EOS>
I
was
thoughtless
 
<EOS>
only
thoughtless
"
  
"
Silence
!
<EOS>
Is
my
coach
at
the
door
?
<EOS>
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Get
ready
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
Your
master
will
not
have
time
to
return
here
.
<EOS>
He
will
meet
me
,
for
the
signing
of
the
contract
,
at
General
Berthelin
's
house
at
two
precisely
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
Are
there
many
people
in
the
street
?
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
be
stared
at
by
the
mob
as
I
go
to
my
carriage
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Dubois
hobbled
penitently
to
the
window
and
looked
out
,
while
his
mistress
walked
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
street
is
almost
empty
,
madame
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Only
a
man
with
a
woman
on
his
arm
,
stopping
and
admiring
your
carriage
.
<EOS>
They
seem
like
decent
people
,
as
well
as
I
can
tell
without
my
spectacles
.
<EOS>
Not
mob
,
I
should
say
,
madame
;
certainly
not
mob
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
.
<EOS>
Attend
me
downstairs
;
and
bring
some
loose
silver
with
you
,
in
case
those
two
decent
people
should
be
fit
objects
for
charity
.
<EOS>
No
orders
for
the
coachman
,
except
that
he
is
to
go
straight
to
the
general
's
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
party
assembled
at
General
Berthelin
's
to
witness
the
signature
of
the
marriage
-
contract
,
comprised
,
besides
the
persons
immediately
interested
in
the
ceremony
of
the
day
,
some
young
ladies
,
friends
of
the
bride
,
and
a
few
officers
,
who
had
been
comrades
of
her
father
's
in
past
years
.
<EOS>
The
guests
were
distributed
,
rather
unequally
,
in
two
handsome
apartments
opening
into
each
other
 
one
called
in
the
house
the
drawing
-
room
,
and
the
other
the
library
.
<EOS>
In
the
drawing
-
room
were
assembled
the
notary
,
with
the
contract
ready
,
the
bride
,
the
young
ladies
,
and
the
majority
of
General
Berthelin
's
friends
.
<EOS>
In
the
library
,
the
remainder
of
the
military
guests
were
amusing
themselves
at
a
billiard
-
table
until
the
signing
of
the
contract
should
take
place
,
while
Danville
and
his
future
father
-
in
-
law
walked
up
and
down
the
room
together
,
the
first
listening
absently
,
the
last
talking
with
all
his
accustomed
energy
,
and
with
more
than
his
accustomed
allowance
of
barrack
-
room
expletives
.
<EOS>
The
general
had
taken
it
into
his
head
to
explain
some
of
the
clauses
in
the
marriage
-
contract
to
the
bridegroom
,
who
,
though
far
better
acquainted
with
their
full
scope
and
meaning
than
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
was
obliged
to
listen
for
civility
's
sake
.
<EOS>
While
the
old
soldier
was
still
in
the
midst
of
his
long
and
confused
harangue
,
a
clock
struck
on
the
library
mantel
-
piece
.
  
<EOS>
"
Two
o'clock
!
"
exclaimed
Danville
,
glad
of
any
pretext
for
interrupting
the
talk
about
the
contract
.
"
<EOS>
Two
o'clock
;
and
my
mother
not
here
yet
!
<EOS>
What
can
be
delaying
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
cried
the
general
.
<EOS>
"
When
did
you
ever
know
a
woman
punctual
,
my
lad
?
<EOS>
If
we
wait
for
your
mother
 
<EOS>
and
she
's
such
a
rabid
aristocrat
that
she
would
never
forgive
us
for
not
waiting
 
<EOS>
we
sha
n't
sign
the
contract
yet
this
half
-
hour
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
!
<EOS>
let
's
go
on
with
what
we
were
talking
about
.
<EOS>
Where
the
devil
was
I
when
that
cursed
clock
struck
and
interrupted
us
?
<EOS>
Now
then
,
Black
Eyes
,
what
's
the
matter
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
question
was
addressed
to
Mademoiselle
Berthelin
,
who
at
that
moment
hastily
entered
the
library
from
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
tall
and
rather
masculine
-
looking
girl
,
with
superb
black
eyes
,
dark
hair
growing
low
on
her
forehead
,
and
something
of
her
father
's
decision
and
bluntness
in
her
manner
of
speaking
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
stranger
in
the
other
room
,
papa
,
who
wants
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
servants
showed
him
upstairs
,
thinking
he
was
one
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
Ought
I
to
have
had
him
shown
down
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
nice
question
!
<EOS>
How
should
I
know
?
<EOS>
Wait
till
I
have
seen
him
,
miss
,
and
<EOS>
then
I
'll
tell
you
!
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
the
general
turned
on
his
heel
,
and
went
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
His
daughter
would
have
followed
him
,
but
Danville
caught
her
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
be
hard
-
hearted
enough
to
leave
me
here
alone
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
become
of
all
my
bosom
friends
in
the
next
room
,
you
selfish
man
,
if
I
stop
here
with
you
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
mademoiselle
,
struggling
to
free
herself
.
  
<EOS>
"
Call
them
in
here
,
"
said
Danville
gayly
,
making
himself
master
of
her
other
hand
.
  
<EOS>
She
laughed
,
and
drew
him
away
toward
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
"
she
cried
,
"
and
let
all
the
ladies
see
what
a
tyrant
I
am
going
to
marry
.
<EOS>
Come
,
and
show
them
what
an
obstinate
,
unreasonable
,
wearisome
"
  
Her
voice
suddenly
failed
her
;
she
shuddered
,
and
turned
faint
.
<EOS>
Danville
's
hand
had
in
one
instant
grown
cold
as
death
in
hers
;
the
momentary
touch
of
his
fingers
,
as
she
felt
their
grasp
loosen
,
struck
some
mysterious
chill
through
her
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
She
glanced
round
at
him
affrightedly
,
and
saw
his
eyes
looking
straight
into
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
fixed
in
a
strange
,
unwavering
,
awful
stare
,
while
,
from
the
rest
of
his
face
,
all
expression
,
all
character
,
all
recognizable
play
and
movement
of
feature
,
had
utterly
gone
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
breathless
,
lifeless
mask
 
<EOS>
a
white
blank
.
<EOS>
With
a
cry
of
terror
,
she
looked
where
he
seemed
to
be
looking
;
and
could
see
nothing
but
the
stranger
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Before
she
could
ask
a
question
 
before
she
could
speak
even
a
single
word
 
<EOS>
her
father
came
to
her
,
caught
Danville
by
the
arm
,
and
pushed
her
roughly
back
into
the
library
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
there
,
and
take
the
women
with
you
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
quick
,
fierce
whisper
.
"
<EOS>
Into
the
library
!
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
the
ladies
,
and
raising
his
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Into
the
library
,
all
of
you
,
along
with
my
daughter
.
"
  
The
women
,
terrified
by
his
manner
,
obeyed
him
in
the
greatest
confusion
.
<EOS>
As
they
hurried
past
him
into
the
library
,
he
signed
to
the
notary
to
follow
;
and
then
closed
the
door
of
communication
between
the
two
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
where
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
addressing
the
old
officers
,
who
had
risen
from
their
chairs
.
<EOS>
"
Stay
,
I
insist
on
it
!
<EOS>
Whatever
happens
,
Jacques
Berthelin
has
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
the
presence
of
his
old
friends
and
companions
.
<EOS>
You
have
seen
the
beginning
,
now
stay
and
see
the
end
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
he
spoke
,
he
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
quitted
his
hold
of
Danville
's
arm
;
step
by
step
they
advanced
together
to
the
place
where
Trudaine
was
standing
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
into
my
house
,
and
asked
me
for
my
daughter
in
marriage
 
<EOS>
and
I
have
given
her
to
you
,
"
said
the
general
,
addressing
Danville
,
quietly
.
<EOS>
"
You
told
me
that
your
first
wife
and
her
brother
were
guillotined
three
years
ago
in
the
time
of
the
Terror
 
<EOS>
and
I
believed
you
.
<EOS>
Now
look
at
that
man
 
<EOS>
look
him
straight
in
the
face
.
<EOS>
He
has
announced
himself
to
me
as
the
brother
of
your
wife
,
and
he
asserts
that
his
sister
is
alive
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
One
of
you
two
has
deceived
me
.
<EOS>
Which
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Danville
tried
to
speak
,
but
no
sound
passed
his
lips
;
tried
to
wrench
his
arm
from
the
grasp
that
was
on
it
,
but
could
not
stir
the
old
soldier
's
steady
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
afraid
?
<EOS>
are
you
a
coward
?
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
look
him
in
the
face
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
general
,
tightening
his
hold
sternly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
stop
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
one
of
the
old
officers
,
coming
forward
.
"
<EOS>
Give
him
time
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
a
case
of
strange
accidental
resemblance
,
which
would
be
enough
,
under
the
circumstances
,
to
discompose
any
man
.
<EOS>
You
will
excuse
me
,
citizen
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
Trudaine
;
"
but
you
are
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
You
have
given
us
no
proof
of
your
identity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
the
proof
,
"
said
Trudaine
,
pointing
to
Danville
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
pursued
the
other
;
"
he
looks
pale
and
startled
enough
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
But
I
say
again
,
let
us
not
be
too
hasty
;
there
are
strange
cases
on
record
of
accidental
resemblances
,
and
this
may
be
one
of
them
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
repeated
those
words
,
Danville
looked
at
him
with
a
faint
,
cringing
gratitude
,
stealing
slowly
over
the
blank
terror
of
his
face
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
his
head
,
murmured
something
,
and
gesticulated
confusedly
with
the
hand
that
he
was
free
to
use
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
old
officer
;
"
look
,
Berthelin
;
he
denies
the
man
's
identity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
?
"
said
the
general
,
appealing
to
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
proofs
to
confute
him
?
<EOS>
If
you
have
,
produce
them
instantly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
the
answer
could
be
given
the
door
leading
into
the
drawing
-
room
from
the
staircase
was
violently
flung
open
,
and
Madame
Danville
 
her
hair
in
disorder
,
<EOS>
her
face
in
its
colorless
terror
looking
like
the
very
counterpart
of
her
son
's
 
appeared
on
the
threshold
,
with
the
old
man
Dubois
and
a
group
of
amazed
and
startled
servants
behind
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
God
's
sake
,
do
n't
sign
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
come
away
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
your
wife
 
in
the
spirit
,
or
in
the
flesh
,
I
know
not
which
 
<EOS>
but
I
have
seen
her
.
<EOS>
Charles
!
<EOS>
Charles
!
<EOS>
as
true
as
Heaven
is
above
us
,
I
have
seen
your
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
seen
her
in
the
flesh
,
living
and
breathing
as
you
see
her
brother
yonder
,
"
said
a
firm
,
quiet
voice
,
from
among
the
servants
on
the
landing
outside
.
  
<EOS>
"
Let
that
man
enter
,
whoever
he
is
!
"
cried
the
general
.
  
<EOS>
Lomaque
passed
Madame
Danville
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
She
trembled
as
he
brushed
by
her
;
then
,
supporting
herself
by
the
wall
,
followed
him
a
few
paces
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
looked
first
at
her
son
 
after
that
,
at
Trudaine
 
after
that
back
again
at
her
son
.
<EOS>
Something
in
her
presence
silenced
every
one
.
<EOS>
There
fell
a
sudden
stillness
over
all
the
assembly
 
<EOS>
a
stillness
so
deep
that
the
eager
,
frightened
whispering
,
and
sharp
rustling
of
dresses
among
the
women
in
the
library
,
became
audible
from
the
other
side
of
the
closed
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Charles
,
"
she
said
,
slowly
advancing
;
"
why
do
you
look
"
She
stopped
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
again
on
her
son
more
earnestly
than
before
;
then
turned
them
suddenly
on
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
looking
at
my
son
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
"
<EOS>
and
I
see
contempt
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
By
what
right
do
you
insult
a
man
whose
grateful
sense
of
his
mother
's
obligations
to
you
made
him
risk
his
life
for
the
saving
of
yours
and
your
sister
's
?
<EOS>
By
what
right
have
you
kept
the
escape
of
my
son
's
wife
from
death
by
the
guillotine
 
<EOS>
an
escape
which
,
for
all
I
know
to
the
contrary
<EOS>
,
his
generous
exertions
were
instrumental
in
effecting
 
a
secret
from
my
son
?
<EOS>
By
what
right
,
I
demand
to
know
,
has
your
treacherous
secrecy
placed
us
in
such
a
position
as
we
now
stand
in
before
the
master
of
this
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
An
expression
of
sorrow
and
pity
passed
over
Trudaine
's
face
while
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
He
retired
a
few
steps
,
and
gave
her
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
general
looked
at
him
with
eager
curiosity
,
and
,
dropping
his
hold
of
Danville
's
arm
,
seemed
about
to
speak
;
but
Lomaque
stepped
forward
at
the
same
time
,
and
held
up
his
hand
to
claim
attention
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
shall
express
the
wishes
of
Citizen
Trudaine
,
"
he
said
,
addressing
Madame
Danville
,
"
if
I
recommend
this
lady
not
to
press
for
too
public
an
answer
to
her
questions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
who
are
you
,
sir
,
who
take
it
on
yourself
to
advise
me
?
"
<EOS>
she
retorted
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
to
say
to
you
,
except
that
I
repeat
those
questions
,
and
that
I
insist
on
their
being
answered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
this
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
asked
the
general
,
addressing
Trudaine
,
and
pointing
to
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
man
unworthy
of
credit
,
"
cried
Danville
,
speaking
audibly
for
the
first
time
,
and
darting
a
look
of
deadly
hatred
at
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
agent
of
police
under
Robespierre
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
in
that
capacity
capable
of
answering
questions
which
refer
to
the
transactions
of
Robespierre
's
tribunals
,
"
remarked
the
ex
-
chief
agent
,
with
his
old
official
self
-
possession
.
  
<EOS>
"
True
!
"
exclaimed
the
general
;
"
the
man
is
right
 
<EOS>
let
him
be
heard
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
help
for
it
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
looking
at
Trudaine
;
"
leave
it
to
me
 
<EOS>
it
is
fittest
that
I
should
speak
.
<EOS>
I
was
present
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
louder
voice
,
"
at
the
trial
of
Citizen
Trudaine
and
his
sister
.
<EOS>
They
were
brought
to
the
bar
through
the
denunciation
of
Citizen
Danville
.
<EOS>
Till
the
confession
of
the
male
prisoner
exposed
the
fact
,
I
can
answer
for
Danville
's
not
being
aware
of
the
real
nature
of
the
offenses
charged
against
Trudaine
and
his
sister
.
<EOS>
When
it
became
known
that
they
had
been
secretly
helping
this
lady
to
escape
from
France
,
and
when
Danville
's
own
head
was
consequently
in
danger
,
I
myself
heard
him
save
it
by
a
false
assertion
that
he
had
been
aware
of
Trudaine
's
conspiracy
from
the
first
"
  
"
Do
you
mean
to
say
,
"
interrupted
the
general
,
"
that
he
proclaimed
himself
in
open
court
as
having
knowingly
denounced
the
man
who
was
on
trial
for
saving
his
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
,
"
answered
Lomaque
.
<EOS>
(
A
murmur
of
horror
and
indignation
rose
from
all
the
strangers
present
at
that
reply
.
)
<EOS>
"
The
reports
of
the
Tribunal
are
existing
to
prove
the
truth
of
what
I
say
,
"
he
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
As
to
the
escape
of
Citizen
Trudaine
and
the
wife
of
Danville
from
the
guillotine
,
it
was
the
work
of
political
circumstances
,
which
there
are
persons
living
to
speak
to
if
necessary
;
and
of
a
little
stratagem
of
mine
,
which
need
not
be
referred
to
now
.
<EOS>
And
,
last
,
with
reference
to
the
concealment
which
followed
the
escape
,
I
beg
to
inform
you
that
it
was
abandoned
the
moment
we
knew
of
what
was
going
on
here
;
and
that
it
was
only
persevered
in
up
to
this
time
,
as
a
natural
measure
of
precaution
on
the
part
of
Citizen
Trudaine
.
<EOS>
From
a
similar
motive
we
now
abstain
from
exposing
his
sister
to
the
shock
and
the
peril
of
being
present
here
.
<EOS>
What
man
with
an
atom
of
feeling
would
risk
letting
her
even
look
again
on
such
a
husband
as
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
glanced
round
him
,
and
pointed
to
Danville
,
as
he
put
the
question
.
<EOS>
Before
a
word
could
be
spoken
by
any
one
else
in
the
room
,
a
low
wailing
cry
of
"
My
mistress
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
mistress
!
<EOS>
"
directed
all
eyes
first
on
the
old
man
Dubois
,
then
on
Madame
Danville
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
been
leaning
against
the
wall
,
before
Lomaque
began
to
speak
;
but
she
stood
perfectly
upright
now
.
<EOS>
She
neither
spoke
nor
moved
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
light
gaudy
ribbons
flaunting
on
her
disordered
head
-
dress
so
much
as
trembled
.
<EOS>
The
old
servant
Dubois
was
crouched
on
his
knees
at
her
side
,
kissing
her
cold
right
hand
,
chafing
it
in
his
,
reiterating
his
faint
,
mournful
cry
,
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
mistress
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
mistress
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
but
she
did
not
appear
to
know
that
he
was
near
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
her
son
advanced
a
step
or
two
toward
her
that
she
seemed
to
awaken
suddenly
from
that
death
-
trance
of
mental
pain
.
<EOS>
Then
she
slowly
raised
the
hand
that
was
free
,
and
waved
him
back
from
her
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
in
obedience
to
the
gesture
,
and
endeavored
to
speak
.
<EOS>
She
waved
her
hand
again
,
and
the
deathly
stillness
of
her
face
began
to
grow
troubled
.
<EOS>
Her
lips
moved
a
little
 
she
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
,
sir
,
for
the
last
time
,
by
keeping
silence
.
<EOS>
You
and
I
have
henceforth
nothing
to
say
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
daughter
of
a
race
of
nobles
,
and
the
widow
of
a
man
of
honor
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
traitor
and
a
false
witness
 
a
thing
from
which
all
true
men
and
true
women
turn
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
I
renounce
you
!
<EOS>
Publicly
,
in
the
presence
of
these
gentlemen
,
I
say
it
 
<EOS>
I
have
no
son
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
turned
her
back
on
him
;
and
,
bowing
to
the
other
persons
in
the
room
with
the
old
formal
courtesy
of
by
-
gone
times
,
walked
slowly
and
steadily
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Stopping
there
,
she
looked
back
;
and
then
the
artificial
courage
of
the
moment
failed
her
.
<EOS>
With
a
faint
,
suppressed
cry
she
clutched
at
the
hand
of
the
old
servant
,
who
still
kept
faithfully
at
her
side
;
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
and
her
head
sank
on
his
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
Help
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
general
to
the
servants
near
the
door
.
"
<EOS>
Help
him
to
take
her
into
the
next
room
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
up
suspiciously
from
his
mistress
to
the
persons
who
were
assisting
him
to
support
her
.
<EOS>
With
a
strange
,
sudden
jealousy
he
shook
his
hand
at
them
.
"
<EOS>
Home
,
"
he
cried
;
"
she
shall
go
home
,
and
I
will
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
Away
!
<EOS>
you
there
 
<EOS>
nobody
holds
her
head
but
Dubois
.
<EOS>
Downstairs
!
<EOS>
downstairs
to
her
carriage
!
<EOS>
She
has
nobody
but
me
now
,
and
I
say
that
she
shall
be
taken
home
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
the
door
closed
,
General
Berthelin
approached
Trudaine
,
who
had
stood
silent
and
apart
,
from
the
time
when
Lomaque
first
appeared
in
the
drawing
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
to
ask
your
pardon
,
"
said
the
old
soldier
,
"
because
I
have
wronged
you
by
a
moment
of
unjust
suspicion
.
<EOS>
For
my
daughter
's
sake
,
I
bitterly
regret
that
we
did
not
see
each
other
long
ago
;
but
I
thank
you
,
nevertheless
,
for
coming
here
,
even
at
the
eleventh
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
While
he
was
speaking
,
one
of
his
friends
came
up
,
and
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
,
said
:
"
Berthelin
,
is
that
scoundrel
to
be
allowed
to
go
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
general
turned
on
his
heel
directly
,
and
beckoned
contemptuously
to
Danville
to
follow
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
well
out
of
ear
-
shot
,
he
spoke
these
words
:
  
"
You
have
been
exposed
as
a
villain
by
your
brother
-
in
-
law
,
and
renounced
as
a
liar
by
your
mother
.
<EOS>
They
have
done
their
duty
by
you
,
and
now
it
only
remains
for
me
to
do
mine
.
<EOS>
When
a
man
enters
the
house
of
another
under
false
pretenses
,
and
compromises
the
reputation
of
his
daughter
,
we
old
army
men
have
a
very
expeditious
way
of
making
him
answer
for
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
just
three
o'clock
now
;
at
five
you
will
find
me
and
one
of
my
friends
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
looked
round
cautiously
 
then
whispered
the
rest
in
Danville
's
ear
 
threw
open
the
door
,
and
pointed
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
"
Our
work
here
is
done
,
"
said
Lomaque
,
laying
his
hand
on
Trudaine
's
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
give
Danville
time
to
get
clear
of
the
house
,
and
then
leave
it
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
sister
!
<EOS>
where
is
she
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Trudaine
,
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Make
your
mind
easy
about
her
.
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
more
when
we
get
out
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
excuse
me
,
I
know
,
"
said
General
Berthelin
,
speaking
to
all
the
persons
present
,
with
his
hand
on
the
library
door
,
"
if
I
leave
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
bad
news
to
break
to
my
daughter
,
and
private
business
after
that
to
settle
with
a
friend
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
saluted
the
company
,
with
his
usual
bluff
nod
of
the
head
,
and
entered
the
library
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
afterward
,
Trudaine
and
Lomaque
left
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
will
find
your
sister
waiting
for
you
in
our
apartment
at
the
hotel
,
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
knows
nothing
,
absolutely
nothing
,
of
what
has
passed
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
But
the
recognition
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Trudaine
,
amazedly
.
"
<EOS>
His
mother
saw
her
.
<EOS>
Surely
she
"
  
"
I
managed
it
so
that
she
should
be
seen
,
and
should
not
see
.
<EOS>
Our
former
experience
of
Danville
suggested
to
me
the
propriety
of
making
the
experiment
,
and
my
old
police
-
office
practice
came
in
useful
in
carrying
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
carriage
standing
at
the
door
,
and
waited
till
the
old
lady
came
down
.
<EOS>
I
walked
your
sister
away
as
she
got
in
,
and
walked
her
back
again
past
the
window
as
the
carriage
drove
off
.
<EOS>
A
moment
did
it
,
and
it
turned
out
as
useful
as
I
thought
it
would
.
<EOS>
Enough
of
that
!
<EOS>
Go
back
now
to
your
sister
.
<EOS>
Keep
indoors
till
the
night
mail
starts
for
Rouen
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
two
places
taken
for
you
on
speculation
.
<EOS>
Go
!
<EOS>
resume
possession
of
your
house
,
and
leave
me
here
to
transact
the
business
which
my
employer
has
intrusted
to
me
,
and
to
see
how
matters
end
with
Danville
and
his
mother
.
<EOS>
I
will
make
time
somehow
to
come
and
bid
you
good
-
by
at
Rouen
,
though
it
should
be
only
for
a
single
day
.
<EOS>
Bah
!
<EOS>
no
thanks
.
<EOS>
Give
us
your
hand
.
<EOS>
I
was
ashamed
to
take
it
eight
years
ago
 
<EOS>
I
can
give
it
a
hearty
shake
now
!
<EOS>
There
is
your
way
;
here
is
mine
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
to
my
business
in
silks
and
satins
,
and
go
you
back
to
your
sister
,
and
help
her
to
pack
up
for
the
night
mail
.
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
Three
more
days
have
passed
.
<EOS>
It
is
evening
.
<EOS>
Rose
,
Trudaine
and
Lomaque
are
seated
together
on
the
bench
that
overlooks
the
windings
of
the
Seine
.
<EOS>
The
old
familiar
scene
spreads
before
them
,
beautiful
as
ever
 
unchanged
,
as
if
it
was
but
yesterday
since
they
had
all
looked
on
it
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
They
talk
together
seriously
and
in
low
voices
.
<EOS>
The
same
recollections
fill
their
hearts
 
recollections
which
they
refrain
from
acknowledging
,
but
the
influence
of
which
each
knows
by
instinct
that
the
other
partakes
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
one
leads
the
conversation
,
sometimes
another
;
but
whoever
speaks
,
the
topic
chosen
is
always
,
as
if
by
common
consent
,
a
topic
connected
with
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
The
evening
darkens
in
,
and
Rose
is
the
first
to
rise
from
the
bench
.
<EOS>
A
secret
look
of
intelligence
passes
between
her
and
her
brother
,
and
then
she
speaks
to
Lomaque
.
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
follow
me
into
the
house
,
"
she
asks
,
"
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
?
<EOS>
I
have
something
that
I
very
much
wish
to
show
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Her
brother
waits
till
she
is
out
of
hearing
,
then
inquires
anxiously
what
has
happened
at
Paris
since
the
night
when
he
and
Rose
left
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
sister
is
free
,
"
Lomaque
answers
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
duel
took
place
,
then
?
"
  
"
The
same
day
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
to
fire
together
.
<EOS>
The
second
of
his
adversary
asserts
that
he
was
paralyzed
with
terror
;
his
own
second
declares
that
he
was
resolved
,
however
he
might
have
lived
,
to
confront
death
courageously
by
offering
his
life
at
the
first
fire
to
the
man
whom
he
had
injured
.
<EOS>
Which
account
is
true
,
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
certain
that
he
did
not
discharge
his
pistol
,
that
he
fell
by
his
antagonist
's
first
bullet
,
and
that
he
never
spoke
afterward
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
his
mother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
hard
to
gain
information
.
<EOS>
Her
doors
are
closed
;
the
old
servant
guards
her
with
jealous
care
.
<EOS>
A
medical
man
is
in
constant
attendance
,
and
there
are
reports
in
the
house
that
the
illness
from
which
she
is
suffering
affects
her
mind
more
than
her
body
.
<EOS>
I
could
ascertain
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
After
that
answer
they
both
remain
silent
for
a
little
while
,
then
rise
from
the
bench
and
walk
toward
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
thought
yet
about
preparing
your
sister
to
hear
of
all
that
has
happened
?
"
<EOS>
Lomaque
asks
,
as
he
sees
the
lamp
-
light
glimmering
in
the
parlor
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
shall
wait
to
prepare
her
till
we
are
settled
again
here
 
till
the
first
holiday
pleasure
of
our
return
has
worn
off
,
and
the
quiet
realities
of
our
every
-
day
life
of
old
have
resumed
their
way
,
"
answers
Trudaine
.
  
<EOS>
They
enter
the
house
.
<EOS>
Rose
beckons
to
Lomaque
to
sit
down
near
her
,
and
places
pen
and
ink
and
an
open
letter
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
last
favor
to
ask
of
you
,
"
she
says
,
smiling
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
will
not
take
long
to
grant
,
"
he
rejoins
;
"
for
I
have
only
to
-
night
to
be
with
you
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
morning
,
before
you
are
up
,
I
must
be
on
my
way
back
to
Chalons
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
sign
that
letter
?
<EOS>
"
she
continues
,
still
smiling
,
"
and
then
give
it
to
me
to
send
to
the
post
?
<EOS>
It
was
dictated
by
Louis
,
and
written
by
me
,
and
it
will
be
quite
complete
,
if
you
will
put
your
name
at
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
I
may
read
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
She
nods
,
and
Lomaque
reads
these
lines
:
  
"
CITIZEN
 
<EOS>
I
beg
respectfully
to
apprise
you
that
the
commission
you
intrusted
to
me
at
Paris
has
been
performed

I
have
also
to
beg
that
you
will
accept
my
resignation
of
the

hold
in
your

<EOS>
The
kindness
shown
me
by
you
and
your

before
you
,
emboldens
me
to
hope
that
you
will
learn
with
pleasure
the
motive
of
my
withdrawal

<EOS>
Two
friends
of
mine
,
who
consider
that
they
are
under
some
obligations
to
me
,
are
anxious
that
I
should
pass
the
rest
of
my
days
in
the
quiet
and
protection
of
their
home
.
<EOS>
Troubles
of
former
years
have
knit
us
together
as
closely
as
if
we
were
all
three
members
of
one
family
.
<EOS>
I
need
the
repose
of
a
happy
fireside
as
much
as
any
man
,
after
the
life
I
have
led
;
and
my
friends
assure
me
so
earnestly
that
their
whole
hearts
are
set
on
establishing
the
old
man
's
easy

chair
by
their
hearth
,
that
I
can
not
summon
resolution
enough
to
turn
my
back
on
them

their
offer

<EOS>
"
Accept
,
then
,
I
beg
of

After
reading
these
lines
,
Lomaque
turned
round
to
Trudaine
and
attempted
to
speak
;
but
the
words
would
not
come
at
command
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
Rose
,
and
tried
to
smile
;
but
his
lip
only
trembled
.
<EOS>
She
dipped
the
pen
in
the
ink
,
and
placed
it
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
bent
his
head
down
quickly
over
the
paper
,
so
that
she
could
not
see
his
face
;
but
still
he
did
not
write
his
name
.
<EOS>
She
put
her
hand
caressingly
on
his
shoulder
,
and
whispered
to
him
:
  
<EOS>
"
Come

She
must
have
her
own

"
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
answer
 
<EOS>
his
head
sank
lower
 
<EOS>
he
hesitated
for
an
instant
 
then
signed
his
name
in
faint
,
trembling
characters
,
at
the
end
of
the
letter
.
  
<EOS>
She
drew
it
away
from
him
gently
.
<EOS>
A
few
tear
-
drops
lay
on
the

<EOS>
As
she
dried
them
with
her
handkerchief
she
looked
at

<EOS>
EPILOGUE
TO
THE
THIRD
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
now
related
all
that
is
eventful
in
the
history
of
SISTER
ROSE
.
<EOS>
To
the
last
the
three
friends
dwelt
together
happily
in
the
cottage
on
the
river
bank
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Clairfait
was
fortunate
enough
to
know
them
,
before
Death
entered
the
little
household
and
took
away
,
in
the
fullness
of
time
,
the
eldest
of
its
members
.
<EOS>
She
describes
Lomaque
,
in
her
quaint
foreign
English
,
as
"
a
brave
,
big
heart
"
;
generous
,
affectionate
,
and
admirably
free
from
the
small
obstinacies
and
prejudices
of
old
age
,
except
on
one
point
:
he
could
never
be
induced
to
take
his
coffee
,
of
an
evening
,
from
any
other
hand
than
the
hand
of
Sister
Rose
.
  
<EOS>
I
linger
over
these
final
particulars
with
a
strange
unwillingness
to
separate
myself
from
them
,
and
give
my
mind
to
other
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
persons
and
events
that
have
occupied
my
attention
for
so
many
nights
past
have
some
peculiar
interest
for
me
that
I
can
not
analyze
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
the
labor
and
time
which
this
story
has
cost
me
have
especially
endeared
it
to
my
sympathies
,
now
that
I
have
succeeded
in
completing
it
.
<EOS>
However
that
may
be
,
I
have
need
of
some
resolution
to
part
at
last
with
Sister
Rose
,
and
return
,
in
the
interests
of
my
next
and
Fourth
Story
,
to
English
ground
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
experienced
so
much
difficulty
,
let
me
add
,
in
deciding
on
the
choice
of
a
new
narrative
out
of
my
collection
,
that
my
wife
has
lost
all
patience
,
and
has
undertaken
,
on
her
own
responsibility
,
to
relieve
me
of
my
unreasonable
perplexities
.
<EOS>
By
her
advice
 
given
,
as
usual
,
without
a
moment
's
hesitation
 
I
can
not
do
better
than
tell
the
story
of
  
<EOS>
THE
LADY
OF
GLENWITH
GRANGE
.
  
<EOS>
PROLOGUE
TO
THE
FOURTH
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
My
practice
in
the
art
of
portrait
-
painting
,
if
it
has
done
nothing
else
,
has
at
least
fitted
me
to
turn
my
talents
(
such
as
they
are
)
to
a
great
variety
of
uses
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
only
taken
the
likenesses
of
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
but
have
also
extended
the
range
of
my
brush
,
under
stress
of
circumstances
,
to
horses
,
dogs
,
houses
,
and
in
one
case
even
to
a
bull
 
<EOS>
the
terror
and
glory
of
his
parish
,
and
the
most
truculent
sitter
I
ever
had
.
<EOS>
The
beast
was
appropriately
named
"
Thunder
and
Lightning
,
"
and
was
the
property
of
a
gentleman
-
farmer
named
Garthwaite
,
a
distant
connection
of
my
wife
's
family
.
  
<EOS>
How
it
was
that
I
escaped
being
gored
to
death
before
I
had
finished
my
picture
is
more
than
I
can
explain
to
this
day
.
<EOS>
"
Thunder
and
Lightning
"
resented
the
very
sight
of
me
and
my
color
-
box
,
as
if
he
viewed
the
taking
of
his
likeness
in
the
light
of
a
personal
insult
.
<EOS>
It
required
two
men
to
coax
him
,
while
a
third
held
him
by
a
ring
in
his
nostrils
,
before
I
could
venture
on
beginning
to
work
.
<EOS>
Even
then
he
always
lashed
his
tail
,
and
jerked
his
huge
head
,
and
rolled
his
fiery
eyes
with
a
devouring
anxiety
to
have
me
on
his
horns
for
daring
to
sit
down
quietly
and
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
Never
,
I
can
honestly
say
,
did
I
feel
more
heartily
grateful
for
the
blessings
of
soundness
of
limb
and
wholeness
of
skin
,
than
when
I
had
completed
the
picture
of
the
bull
!
  
<EOS>
One
morning
,
when
I
had
but
little
more
than
half
done
my
unwelcome
task
,
my
friend
and
I
<EOS>
were
met
on
our
way
to
the
bull
's
stable
by
the
farm
bailiff
,
who
informed
us
gravely
that
"
Thunder
and
Lightning
"
was
just
then
in
such
an
especially
surly
state
of
temper
as
to
render
it
quite
unsafe
for
me
to
think
of
painting
him
.
<EOS>
I
looked
inquiringly
at
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
who
smiled
with
an
air
of
comic
resignation
,
and
said
,
"
Very
well
,
then
,
we
have
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
say
to
a
morning
's
fishing
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
now
that
my
bull
's
bad
temper
has
given
us
a
holiday
?
"
  
<EOS>
I
replied
,
with
perfect
truth
,
that
I
knew
nothing
about
fishing
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
who
was
as
ardent
<EOS>
an
angler
in
his
way
as
Izaak
Walton
himself
,
was
not
to
be
appeased
even
by
the
best
of
excuses
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
never
too
late
to
learn
,
"
cried
he
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
a
fisherman
of
you
in
no
time
,
if
you
will
only
attend
to
my
directions
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
impossible
for
me
to
make
any
more
apologies
,
without
the
risk
of
appealing
discourteous
.
<EOS>
So
I
thanked
my
host
for
his
friendly
intentions
,
and
,
with
some
secret
misgivings
,
accepted
the
first
fishing
-
rod
that
he
put
into
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
shall
soon
get
there
,
"
said
Mr.
Garthwaite
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
taking
you
to
the
best
mill
-
stream
in
the
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
all
one
to
me
whether
we
got
there
soon
or
late
and
whether
the
stream
was
good
or
bad
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
did
my
best
to
conceal
my
unsportsman
-
like
apathy
;
and
tried
to
look
quite
happy
and
very
impatient
to
begin
,
as
we
drew
near
to
the
mill
,
and
heard
louder
and
louder
the
gushing
of
many
waters
all
round
it
.
  
<EOS>
Leading
the
way
immediately
to
a
place
beneath
the
falling
stream
,
where
there
was
a
deep
,
eddying
pool
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
baited
and
threw
in
his
line
before
I
had
fixed
the
joints
of
my
fishing
-
rod
.
<EOS>
This
first
difficulty
overcome
,
I
involuntarily
plunged
into
some
excellent
,
but
rather
embarrassing
,
sport
with
my
line
and
hook
.
<EOS>
I
caught
every
one
of
my
garments
,
from
head
to
foot
;
I
angled
for
my
own
clothes
with
the
dexterity
and
success
of
Izaak
Walton
himself
.
<EOS>
I
caught
my
hat
,
my
jacket
,
my
waistcoat
,
my
trousers
,
my
fingers
,
and
my
thumbs
 
<EOS>
some
devil
possessed
my
hook
;
some
more
than
eel
-
like
vitality
twirled
and
twisted
in
every
inch
of
my
line
.
<EOS>
By
the
time
my
host
arrived
to
assist
me
,
I
had
attached
myself
to
my
fishing
-
rod
,
apparently
for
life
.
<EOS>
All
difficulties
yielded
,
however
,
to
his
patience
and
skill
;
my
hook
was
baited
for
me
,
and
thrown
in
;
my
rod
was
put
into
my
hand
;
my
friend
went
back
to
his
place
;
and
we
began
at
last
to
angle
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
We
certainly
caught
a
few
fish
(
in
my
case
,
I
mean
,
of
course
,
that
the
fish
caught
themselves
)
;
but
they
were
scanty
in
number
and
light
in
weight
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
presence
of
the
miller
's
foreman
 
a
gloomy
personage
,
who
stood
staring
disastrously
upon
us
from
a
little
flower
-
garden
on
the
opposite
bank
 
<EOS>
that
cast
adverse
influence
over
our
sport
;
or
whether
my
want
of
faith
and
earnestness
as
an
angler
acted
retributively
on
my
companion
as
well
as
myself
,
I
know
not
;
but
it
is
certain
that
he
got
almost
as
little
reward
for
his
skill
as
I
got
for
my
patience
.
<EOS>
After
nearly
two
hours
of
intense
expectation
on
my
part
,
and
intense
angling
on
his
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
jerked
his
line
out
of
the
water
in
a
rage
,
and
bade
me
follow
him
to
another
place
,
declaring
that
the
stream
must
have
been
netted
by
poachers
in
the
night
,
who
had
taken
all
the
large
fish
away
with
them
,
and
had
thrown
in
the
small
ones
to
grow
until
their
next
visit
.
<EOS>
We
moved
away
,
further
down
the
bank
,
leaving
the
imperturbable
foreman
still
in
the
flower
-
garden
,
staring
at
us
speechlessly
on
our
departure
,
exactly
as
he
had
already
stared
at
us
on
our
approach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
a
minute
,
"
said
Mr.
Garthwaite
suddenly
,
after
we
had
walked
some
distance
in
silence
by
the
side
of
the
stream
,
"
I
have
an
idea
.
<EOS>
Now
we
are
out
for
a
day
's
angling
,
we
wo
n't
be
balked
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
trying
the
water
here
again
,
we
will
go
where
I
know
,
by
experience
,
that
the
fishing
is
excellent
.
<EOS>
And
what
is
more
,
you
shall
be
introduced
to
a
lady
whose
appearance
is
sure
to
interest
you
,
and
whose
history
,
I
can
tell
you
beforehand
,
is
a
very
remarkable
one
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Indeed
,
"
I
said
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
ask
in
what
way
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
connected
,
"
answered
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
"
with
an
extraordinary
story
,
which
relates
to
a
family
once
settled
in
an
old
house
in
this
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
Her
name
is
Miss
Welwyn
;
but
she
is
less
formally
known
an
among
the
poor
people
about
here
,
who
love
her
dearly
,
and
honor
her
almost
superstitiously
,
as
the
Lady
of
Glenwith
Grange
.
<EOS>
Wait
till
you
have
seen
her
before
you
ask
me
to
say
anything
more
.
<EOS>
She
lives
in
the
strictest
retirement
;
I
am
almost
the
only
visitor
who
is
admitted
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
say
you
had
rather
not
go
in
.
<EOS>
Any
friend
of
mine
will
be
welcome
at
the
Grange
(
the
scene
of
the
story
,
remember
)
,
for
my
sake
 
the
more
especially
because
I
have
never
abused
my
privilege
of
introduction
.
<EOS>
The
place
is
not
above
two
miles
from
here
,
and
the
stream
(
which
we
call
,
in
our
county
dialect
,
Glenwith
Beck
)
runs
through
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
As
we
walked
on
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
's
manner
altered
.
<EOS>
He
became
unusually
silent
and
thoughtful
.
<EOS>
The
mention
of
Miss
Welwyn
's
name
had
evidently
called
up
some
recollections
which
were
not
in
harmony
with
his
every
-
day
mood
.
<EOS>
Feeling
that
to
talk
to
him
on
any
indifferent
subject
would
be
only
to
interrupt
his
thoughts
to
no
purpose
,
I
walked
by
his
side
in
perfect
silence
,
looking
out
already
with
some
curiosity
and
impatience
for
a
first
view
of
Glenwith
Grange
.
<EOS>
We
stopped
at
last
close
by
an
old
church
,
standing
on
the
outskirts
of
a
pretty
village
.
<EOS>
The
low
wall
of
the
churchyard
was
bounded
on
one
side
by
a
plantation
,
and
was
joined
by
a
park
paling
,
in
which
I
noticed
a
small
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
opened
it
,
and
led
me
along
a
shrubbery
path
,
which
conducted
us
circuitously
to
the
dwelling
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
We
had
evidently
entered
by
a
private
way
,
for
we
approached
the
building
by
the
back
.
<EOS>
I
looked
up
at
it
curiously
,
and
saw
standing
at
one
of
the
windows
on
the
lower
floor
a
little
girl
watching
us
as
we
advanced
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
about
nine
or
ten
years
old
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
stopping
a
moment
to
look
up
at
her
,
her
clear
complexion
and
her
long
dark
hair
were
so
beautiful
.
<EOS>
And
yet
there
was
something
in
her
expression
 
a
dimness
and
vacancy
in
her
large
eyes
 
a
changeless
,
unmeaning
smile
on
her
parted
lips
 
which
seemed
to
jar
with
all
that
was
naturally
attractive
in
her
face
;
which
perplexed
,
disappointed
,
and
even
shocked
me
,
though
I
hardy
<EOS>
knew
why
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
who
had
been
walking
along
thoughtfully
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
,
turned
back
when
he
found
me
lingering
behind
him
;
looked
up
where
I
was
looking
;
started
a
little
,
I
thought
;
then
took
my
arm
,
whispered
rather
impatiently
,
"
Do
n't
say
anything
about
having
seen
that
poor
child
when
you
are
introduced
to
Miss
Welwyn
<EOS>
;
I
'll
tell
you
why
afterward
,
"
and
led
me
round
hastily
to
the
front
of
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
dreary
old
house
,
with
a
lawn
in
front
thickly
sprinkled
with
flower
-
beds
,
and
creepers
of
all
sorts
climbing
in
profusion
about
the
heavy
stone
porch
and
the
mullions
of
the
lower
windows
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
these
prettiest
of
all
ornaments
clustering
brightly
round
the
building
 
in
spite
of
the
perfect
repair
in
which
it
was
kept
from
top
to
bottom
 
there
was
something
repellent
to
me
in
the
aspect
of
the
whole
place
:
a
deathly
stillness
hung
over
it
,
which
fell
oppressively
on
my
spirits
.
<EOS>
When
my
companion
rang
the
loud
,
deep
-
toned
bell
,
the
sound
startled
me
as
if
we
had
been
committing
a
crime
in
disturbing
the
silence
.
<EOS>
And
when
the
door
was
opened
by
an
old
female
servant
(
while
the
hollow
echo
of
the
bell
was
still
vibrating
in
the
air
)
,
I
could
hardly
imagine
it
possible
that
we
should
be
let
in
.
<EOS>
We
were
admitted
,
however
,
without
the
slightest
demur
.
<EOS>
I
remarked
that
there
was
the
same
atmosphere
of
dreary
repose
inside
the
house
which
I
had
already
observed
,
or
rather
felt
,
outside
it
.
<EOS>
No
dogs
barked
at
our
approach
 
<EOS>
no
doors
banged
in
the
servants
'
offices
 
no
heads
peeped
over
the
banisters
 
<EOS>
not
one
of
the
ordinary
domestic
consequences
of
an
unexpected
visit
in
the
country
met
either
eye
or
ear
.
<EOS>
The
large
shadowy
apartment
,
half
library
,
half
breakfast
-
room
,
into
which
we
were
ushered
,
was
as
solitary
as
the
hall
of
entrance
;
unless
I
except
such
drowsy
evidences
of
life
as
were
here
presented
to
us
in
the
shape
of
an
Angola
cat
and
a
gray
parrot
 
the
first
lying
asleep
in
a
chair
,
the
second
sitting
ancient
,
solemn
,
and
voiceless
,
in
a
large
cage
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
walked
to
the
window
when
we
entered
,
without
saying
a
word
.
<EOS>
Determining
to
let
his
taciturn
humor
have
its
way
,
I
asked
him
no
questions
,
but
looked
around
the
room
to
see
what
information
it
would
give
me
(
and
rooms
often
do
give
such
information
)
about
the
character
and
habits
of
the
owner
of
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Two
tables
covered
with
books
were
the
first
objects
that
attracted
me
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
them
,
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
all
-
influencing
periodical
literature
of
the
present
day
 
whose
sphere
is
already
almost
without
limit
;
whose
readers
,
even
in
our
time
,
may
be
numbered
by
millions
 
was
entirely
unrepresented
on
Miss
Welwyn
's
table
.
<EOS>
Nothing
modern
,
nothing
contemporary
,
in
the
world
of
books
,
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
volumes
beneath
my
hand
,
not
one
bore
the
badge
of
the
circulating
library
,
or
wore
the
flaring
modern
livery
of
gilt
cloth
.
<EOS>
Every
work
that
I
took
up
had
been
written
at
least
fifteen
or
twenty
years
since
.
<EOS>
The
prints
hanging
round
the
walls
(
toward
which
I
next
looked
)
were
all
engraved
from
devotional
subjects
by
the
old
masters
;
the
music
-
stand
contained
no
music
of
later
date
than
the
compositions
of
Haydn
and
Mozart
.
<EOS>
Whatever
I
examined
besides
,
told
me
,
with
the
same
consistency
,
the
same
strange
tale
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
these
possessions
lived
in
the
by
-
gone
time
;
lived
among
old
recollections
and
old
associations
 
a
voluntary
recluse
from
all
that
was
connected
with
the
passing
day
.
<EOS>
In
Miss
Welwyn
's
house
,
the
stir
,
the
tumult
,
the
"
idle
business
"
of
the
world
evidently
appealed
in
vain
to
sympathies
which
grew
no
longer
with
the
growing
hour
.
  
<EOS>
As
these
thoughts
were
passing
through
my
mind
,
the
door
opened
and
the
lady
herself
appeared
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
certainly
past
the
prime
of
life
;
longer
past
it
,
as
I
afterward
discovered
,
than
she
really
was
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
remember
,
in
any
other
face
,
to
have
seen
so
much
of
the
better
part
of
the
beauty
of
early
womanhood
still
remaining
,
as
I
saw
in
hers
.
<EOS>
Sorrow
had
evidently
passed
over
the
fair
,
calm
countenance
before
me
,
but
had
left
resignation
there
as
its
only
trace
.
<EOS>
Her
expression
was
still
youthful
 
youthful
in
its
kindness
and
its
candor
especially
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
when
I
looked
at
her
hair
,
that
was
now
growing
gray
 
at
her
wan
,
thin
hands
 
at
the
faint
lines
marked
round
her
mouth
 
at
the
sad
serenity
of
her
eyes
,
that
I
fairly
detected
the
mark
of
age
;
and
,
more
than
that
,
the
token
of
some
great
grief
,
which
had
been
conquered
,
but
not
banished
.
<EOS>
Even
from
her
voice
alone
 
from
the
peculiar
uncertainty
of
its
low
,
calm
tones
when
she
spoke
 
it
was
easy
to
conjecture
that
she
must
have
passed
through
sufferings
,
at
some
time
of
her
life
,
which
had
tried
to
the
quick
the
noble
nature
that
they
could
not
subdue
.
  
<EOS>
Mr.
Garthwaite
and
she
met
each
other
almost
like
brother
and
sister
;
it
was
plain
that
the
friendly
intimacy
between
them
had
been
of
very
long
duration
.
<EOS>
Our
visit
was
a
short
one
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
never
advanced
beyond
the
commonplace
topics
suited
to
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
was
,
therefore
,
from
what
I
saw
,
and
not
from
what
I
heard
,
that
I
was
enabled
to
form
my
judgment
of
Miss
Welwyn
.
<EOS>
Deeply
as
she
had
interested
me
 
far
more
deeply
than
I
at
all
know
how
to
explain
in
fitting
words
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
say
that
I
was
unwilling
to
depart
when
we
rose
to
take
leave
.
<EOS>
Though
nothing
could
be
more
courteous
and
more
kind
than
her
manner
toward
me
during
the
whole
interview
,
I
could
still
perceive
that
it
cost
her
some
effort
to
repress
in
my
presence
the
shades
of
sadness
and
reserve
which
seemed
often
ready
to
steal
over
her
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
confess
that
when
I
once
or
twice
heard
the
half
-
sigh
stifled
,
and
saw
the
momentary
relapse
into
thoughtfulness
suddenly
restrained
,
I
felt
an
indefinable
awkwardness
in
my
position
which
made
me
ill
at
ease
;
which
set
me
doubting
whether
,
as
a
perfect
stranger
,
I
had
done
right
in
suffering
myself
to
be
introduced
where
no
new
faces
could
awaken
either
interest
or
curiosity
;
where
no
new
sympathies
could
ever
be
felt
,
no
new
friendships
ever
be
formed
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
we
had
taken
leave
of
Miss
Welwyn
,
and
were
on
our
way
to
the
stream
in
her
grounds
,
I
more
than
satisfied
Mr.
Garthwaite
that
the
impression
the
lady
had
produced
on
me
was
of
no
transitory
kind
,
by
overwhelming
him
with
questions
about
her
 
not
omitting
one
or
two
incidental
inquiries
on
the
subject
of
the
little
girl
whom
I
had
seen
at
the
back
window
.
<EOS>
He
only
rejoined
that
his
story
would
answer
all
my
questions
;
and
that
he
would
begin
to
tell
it
as
soon
as
we
had
arrived
at
Glenwith
Beck
,
and
were
comfortably
settled
to
fishing
.
  
<EOS>
Five
minutes
more
of
walking
brought
us
to
the
bank
of
the
stream
,
and
showed
us
the
water
running
smoothly
and
slowly
,
tinged
with
the
softest
green
luster
from
the
reflections
of
trees
which
almost
entirely
arched
it
over
.
<EOS>
Leaving
me
to
admire
the
view
at
my
ease
,
Mr.
Garthwaite
occupied
himself
with
the
necessary
preparations
for
angling
,
baiting
my
hook
as
well
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
Then
,
desiring
me
to
sit
near
him
on
the
bank
,
he
at
last
satisfied
my
curiosity
by
beginning
his
story
.
<EOS>
I
shall
relate
it
in
his
own
manner
,
and
,
as
nearly
as
possible
,
in
his
own
words
.
  
<EOS>
THE
ANGLER
'S
STORY
  
of
  
<EOS>
THE
LADY
OF
GLENWITH
GRANGE
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
known
Miss
Welwyn
long
enough
to
be
able
to
bear
personal
testimony
to
the
truth
of
many
of
the
particulars
which
I
am
now
about
to
relate
.
<EOS>
I
knew
her
father
,
and
her
younger
sister
Rosamond
;
and
I
was
acquainted
with
the
Frenchman
who
became
Rosamond
's
husband
.
<EOS>
These
are
the
persons
of
whom
it
will
be
principally
necessary
for
me
to
speak
.
<EOS>
They
are
the
only
prominent
characters
in
my
story
.
  
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
's
father
died
some
years
since
.
<EOS>
I
remember
him
very
well
 
though
he
never
excited
in
me
,
or
in
any
one
else
that
I
ever
heard
of
,
the
slightest
feeling
of
interest
.
<EOS>
When
I
have
said
that
he
inherited
a
very
large
fortune
,
amassed
during
his
father
's
time
,
by
speculations
of
a
very
daring
,
very
fortunate
,
but
not
always
very
honorable
kind
,
and
that
he
bought
this
old
house
with
the
notion
of
raising
his
social
position
,
by
making
himself
a
member
of
our
landed
aristocracy
in
these
parts
<EOS>
,
I
have
told
you
as
much
about
him
,
I
suspect
,
as
you
would
care
to
hear
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
thoroughly
commonplace
man
,
with
no
great
virtues
and
no
great
vices
in
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
little
heart
,
a
feeble
mind
,
an
amiable
temper
,
a
tall
figure
,
and
a
handsome
face
.
<EOS>
More
than
this
need
not
,
and
can
not
,
be
said
on
the
subject
of
Mr.
Welwyn
's
character
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
have
seen
the
late
Mrs.
Welwyn
very
often
as
a
child
;
but
I
can
not
say
that
I
remember
anything
more
of
her
than
that
she
was
tall
and
handsome
,
and
very
generous
and
sweet
-
tempered
toward
me
when
I
was
in
her
company
.
<EOS>
She
was
her
husband
's
superior
in
birth
,
as
in
everything
else
;
was
a
great
reader
of
books
in
all
languages
;
and
possessed
such
admirable
talents
as
a
musician
,
that
her
wonderful
playing
on
the
organ
is
remembered
and
talked
of
to
this
day
among
the
old
people
in
our
country
houses
about
here
.
<EOS>
All
her
friends
,
as
I
have
heard
,
were
disappointed
when
she
married
Mr.
Welwyn
,
rich
as
he
was
;
and
were
afterward
astonished
to
find
her
preserving
the
appearance
,
at
least
,
of
being
perfectly
happy
with
a
husband
who
,
neither
in
mind
nor
heart
,
was
worthy
of
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
generally
supposed
(
and
I
have
no
doubt
correctly
)
that
she
found
her
great
happiness
and
her
great
consolation
in
her
little
girl
<EOS>
Ida
 
now
the
lady
from
whom
we
have
just
parted
.
<EOS>
The
child
took
after
her
mother
from
the
first
 
inheriting
her
mother
's
fondness
for
books
,
her
mother
's
love
of
music
,
her
mother
's
quick
sensibilities
,
and
,
more
than
all
,
her
mother
's
quiet
firmness
,
patience
,
and
loving
kindness
of
disposition
.
<EOS>
From
Ida
's
earliest
years
,
Mrs.
Welwyn
undertook
the
whole
superintendence
of
her
education
.
<EOS>
The
two
were
hardly
ever
apart
,
within
doors
or
without
.
<EOS>
Neighbors
and
friends
said
that
the
little
girl
was
being
brought
up
too
fancifully
,
and
was
not
enough
among
other
children
,
was
sadly
neglected
as
to
all
reasonable
and
practical
teaching
,
and
was
perilously
encouraged
in
those
dreamy
and
imaginative
tendencies
of
which
she
had
naturally
more
than
her
due
share
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
perhaps
,
some
truth
in
this
;
and
there
might
have
been
still
more
,
if
Ida
had
possessed
an
ordinary
character
,
or
had
been
reserved
for
an
ordinary
destiny
.
<EOS>
But
she
was
a
strange
child
from
the
first
,
and
a
strange
future
was
in
store
for
her
.
  
<EOS>
Little
Ida
reached
her
eleventh
year
without
either
brother
or
sister
to
be
her
playfellow
and
companion
at
home
.
<EOS>
Immediately
after
that
period
,
however
,
her
sister
Rosamond
was
born
.
<EOS>
Though
Mr.
Welwyn
's
own
desire
was
to
have
had
a
son
,
there
were
,
nevertheless
,
great
rejoicings
yonder
in
the
old
house
on
the
birth
of
this
second
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
all
turned
,
only
a
few
months
afterward
,
to
the
bitterest
grief
and
despair
:
the
Grange
lost
its
mistress
.
<EOS>
While
Rosamond
was
still
an
infant
in
arms
,
her
mother
died
.
  
<EOS>
Mrs.
Welwyn
had
been
afflicted
with
some
disorder
after
the
birth
of
her
second
child
,
the
name
of
which
I
am
not
learned
enough
in
medical
science
to
be
able
to
remember
.
<EOS>
I
only
know
that
she
recovered
from
it
,
to
all
appearance
,
in
an
unexpectedly
short
time
;
that
she
suffered
a
fatal
relapse
,
and
that
she
died
a
lingering
and
a
painful
death
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Welwyn
(
who
,
in
after
years
,
had
a
habit
of
vaingloriously
describing
his
marriage
as
"
a
love
-
match
on
both
sides
"
)
was
really
fond
of
his
wife
in
his
own
frivolous
,
feeble
way
,
and
suffered
as
acutely
as
such
a
man
could
suffer
,
during
the
latter
days
of
her
illness
,
and
at
the
terrible
time
when
the
doctors
,
one
and
all
,
confessed
that
her
life
was
a
thing
to
be
despaired
of
.
<EOS>
He
burst
into
irrepressible
passions
of
tears
,
and
was
always
obliged
to
leave
the
sick
-
room
whenever
Mrs.
Welwyn
spoke
of
her
approaching
end
.
<EOS>
The
last
solemn
words
of
the
dying
woman
,
the
tenderest
messages
that
she
could
give
,
<EOS>
the
dearest
parting
wishes
that
she
could
express
,
the
most
earnest
commands
that
she
could
leave
behind
her
,
<EOS>
the
gentlest
reasons
for
consolation
that
she
could
suggest
to
the
survivors
among
those
who
loved
her
,
were
not
poured
into
her
husband
's
ear
,
but
into
her
child
's
.
<EOS>
From
the
first
period
of
her
illness
,
Ida
had
persisted
in
remaining
in
the
sick
-
room
,
rarely
speaking
,
never
showing
outwardly
any
signs
of
terror
or
grief
,
except
when
she
was
removed
from
it
;
and
then
bursting
into
hysterical
passions
of
weeping
,
which
no
expostulations
,
no
arguments
,
no
commands
 
nothing
,
in
short
,
but
bringing
her
back
to
the
bedside
 
ever
availed
to
calm
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
had
been
her
playfellow
,
her
companion
her
dearest
and
most
familiar
friend
;
and
there
seemed
something
in
the
remembrance
of
this
which
,
instead
of
overwhelming
the
child
with
despair
,
strengthened
her
to
watch
faithfully
and
bravely
by
her
dying
parent
to
the
very
last
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
parting
moment
was
over
,
and
when
Mr.
Welwyn
,
unable
to
bear
the
shock
of
being
present
in
the
house
of
death
at
the
time
of
his
wife
's
funeral
,
left
home
and
went
to
stay
with
one
of
his
relations
in
a
distant
part
of
England
,
Ida
,
whom
it
had
been
his
wish
to
take
away
with
him
,
petitioned
earnestly
to
be
left
behind
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
promised
mamma
before
she
died
that
I
would
be
as
good
to
my
little
sister
Rosamond
as
she
had
been
to
me
,
"
said
the
child
,
simply
;
"
and
she
told
me
in
return
that
I
might
wait
here
and
see
her
laid
in
her
grave
.
<EOS>
"
There
happened
to
be
an
aunt
of
Mrs.
Welwyn
,
and
an
old
servant
of
the
family
,
in
the
house
at
this
time
,
who
understood
Ida
much
better
than
her
father
did
,
and
they
persuaded
him
not
to
take
her
away
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
my
mother
say
that
the
effect
of
the
child
's
appearance
at
the
funeral
on
her
,
and
on
all
who
went
to
see
it
,
was
something
that
she
could
never
think
of
without
the
tears
coming
into
her
eyes
,
and
could
never
forget
to
the
last
day
of
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
It
must
have
been
very
shortly
after
this
period
that
I
saw
Ida
for
the
first
time
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
accompanying
my
mother
on
a
visit
to
the
old
house
we
have
just
left
,
in
the
summer
,
when
I
was
at
home
for
the
holidays
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
lovely
,
sunshiny
morning
.
<EOS>
There
was
nobody
indoors
,
and
we
walked
out
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
As
we
approached
that
lawn
yonder
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
shrubbery
,
I
saw
,
first
,
a
young
woman
in
mourning
(
apparently
a
servant
)
<EOS>
sitting
reading
;
then
a
little
girl
,
dressed
all
in
black
,
moving
toward
us
slowly
over
the
bright
turf
,
and
holding
up
before
her
a
baby
,
whom
she
was
trying
to
teach
to
walk
.
<EOS>
She
looked
,
to
my
ideas
,
so
very
young
to
be
engaged
in
such
an
occupation
as
this
,
and
her
gloomy
black
frock
appeared
to
be
such
an
unnaturally
grave
garment
for
a
mere
child
of
her
age
,
and
looked
so
doubly
dismal
by
contrast
with
the
brilliant
sunny
lawn
on
which
she
stood
,
that
I
quite
started
when
I
first
saw
her
,
and
eagerly
asked
my
mother
who
she
was
.
<EOS>
The
answer
informed
me
of
the
sad
family
story
,
which
I
have
been
just
relating
to
you
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Welwyn
had
then
been
buried
about
three
months
;
and
Ida
,
in
her
childish
way
,
was
trying
,
as
she
had
promised
,
to
supply
her
mother
's
place
to
her
infant
sister
Rosamond
.
  
<EOS>
I
only
mention
this
simple
incident
,
because
it
is
necessary
,
before
I
proceed
to
the
eventful
part
of
my
narrative
,
that
you
should
know
exactly
in
what
relation
the
sisters
stood
toward
one
another
from
the
first
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
last
parting
words
that
Mrs.
Welwyn
had
spoken
to
her
child
,
none
had
been
oftener
repeated
,
none
more
solemnly
urged
,
than
those
which
had
commended
the
little
Rosamond
to
Ida
's
love
and
care
.
<EOS>
To
other
persons
,
the
full
,
the
all
-
trusting
dependence
which
the
dying
mother
was
known
to
have
placed
in
a
child
hardly
eleven
years
old
,
seemed
merely
a
proof
of
that
helpless
desire
to
cling
even
to
the
feeblest
consolations
,
which
the
approach
of
death
so
often
brings
with
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
event
showed
that
the
trust
so
strangely
placed
had
not
been
ventured
vainly
when
it
was
committed
to
young
and
tender
hands
.
<EOS>
The
whole
future
existence
of
the
child
was
one
noble
proof
that
she
had
been
worthy
of
her
mother
's
dying
confidence
,
when
it
was
first
reposed
in
her
.
<EOS>
In
that
simple
incident
which
I
have
just
mentioned
the
new
life
of
the
two
motherless
sisters
was
all
foreshadowed
.
  
<EOS>
Time
passed
.
<EOS>
I
left
school
 
<EOS>
went
to
college
 
traveled
in
Germany
,
and
stayed
there
some
time
to
learn
the
language
.
<EOS>
At
every
interval
when
I
came
home
,
and
asked
about
the
Welwyns
,
the
answer
was
,
in
substance
,
almost
always
the
same
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Welwyn
was
giving
his
regular
dinners
,
performing
his
regular
duties
as
a
county
magistrate
,
enjoying
his
regular
recreations
as
an
a
amateur
farmer
and
an
eager
sportsman
.
<EOS>
His
two
daughters
were
never
separate
.
<EOS>
Ida
was
the
same
strange
,
quiet
,
retiring
girl
,
that
she
had
always
been
;
and
was
still
(
as
the
phrase
went
)
<EOS>
"
spoiling
"
Rosamond
in
every
way
in
which
it
was
possible
for
an
elder
sister
to
spoil
a
younger
by
too
much
kindness
.
  
<EOS>
I
myself
went
to
the
Grange
occasionally
,
when
I
was
in
this
neighborhood
,
in
holiday
and
vacation
time
;
and
was
able
to
test
the
correctness
of
the
picture
of
life
there
which
had
been
drawn
for
me
.
<EOS>
I
remember
the
two
sisters
,
when
Rosamond
was
four
or
five
years
old
;
and
when
Ida
seemed
to
me
,
even
then
,
to
be
more
like
the
child
's
mother
than
her
sister
.
<EOS>
She
bore
with
her
little
caprices
as
sisters
do
not
bear
with
one
another
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
patient
at
lesson
-
time
,
so
anxious
to
conceal
any
weariness
that
might
overcome
her
in
play
hours
,
so
proud
when
Rosamond
's
beauty
was
noticed
,
so
grateful
for
Rosamond
's
kisses
when
the
child
thought
of
bestowing
them
,
so
quick
to
notice
all
that
Rosamond
did
,
and
to
attend
to
<EOS>
all
that
Rosamond
said
,
even
when
visitors
were
in
the
room
,
that
she
seemed
,
to
my
boyish
observation
,
altogether
different
from
other
elder
sisters
in
other
family
circles
into
which
I
was
then
received
.
  
<EOS>
I
remember
then
,
again
,
when
Rosamond
was
just
growing
to
womanhood
,
and
was
in
high
spirits
at
the
prospect
of
spending
a
season
in
London
,
and
being
presented
at
court
.
<EOS>
She
was
very
beautiful
at
that
time
 
much
handsomer
than
Ida
.
<EOS>
Her
"
accomplishments
"
were
talked
of
far
and
near
in
our
country
circles
.
<EOS>
Few
,
if
any
,
of
the
people
,
however
,
who
applauded
her
playing
and
singing
,
who
admired
her
water
-
color
drawings
,
who
were
delighted
at
her
fluency
when
she
spoke
French
,
and
amazed
at
her
ready
comprehension
when
she
read
German
,
knew
how
little
of
all
this
elegant
mental
cultivation
and
nimble
manual
dexterity
she
owed
to
her
governess
and
masters
,
and
how
much
to
her
elder
sister
.
<EOS>
It
was
Ida
who
really
found
out
the
means
of
stimulating
her
when
she
was
idle
;
Ida
who
helped
her
through
all
her
worst
difficulties
;
Ida
who
gently
conquered
her
defects
of
memory
over
her
books
,
her
inaccuracies
of
ear
at
the
piano
,
her
errors
of
taste
when
she
took
the
brush
and
pencil
in
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
Ida
alone
who
worked
these
marvels
,
and
<EOS>
whose
all
-
sufficient
reward
for
her
hardest
exertions
was
a
chance
word
of
kindness
from
her
sister
's
lips
.
<EOS>
Rosamond
was
not
unaffectionate
,
and
not
ungrateful
;
but
she
inherited
much
of
her
father
's
commonness
and
frivolity
of
character
.
<EOS>
She
became
so
accustomed
to
owe
everything
to
her
sister
 
to
resign
all
her
most
trifling
difficulties
to
Ida
's
ever
-
ready
care
 
to
have
all
her
tastes
consulted
by
Ida
's
ever
-
watchful
kindness
 
that
she
never
appreciated
,
as
it
deserved
,
the
deep
,
devoted
love
of
which
she
was
the
object
.
<EOS>
When
Ida
refused
two
good
offers
of
marriage
,
Rosamond
was
as
much
astonished
as
the
veriest
strangers
,
who
wondered
why
the
elder
Miss
Welwyn
seemed
bent
on
remaining
single
all
her
life
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
journey
to
London
,
to
which
I
have
already
alluded
,
took
place
,
Ida
accompanied
her
father
and
sister
.
<EOS>
If
she
had
consulted
her
own
tastes
,
she
would
have
remained
in
the
country
;
but
Rosamond
declared
that
she
should
feel
quite
lost
and
helpless
twenty
times
a
day
,
in
town
,
without
her
sister
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
nature
of
Ida
to
sacrifice
herself
to
any
one
whom
she
loved
,
on
the
smallest
occasions
as
well
as
the
greatest
.
<EOS>
Her
affection
was
as
intuitively
ready
to
sanctify
Rosamond
's
slightest
caprices
as
to
excuse
Rosamond
's
most
thoughtless
faults
.
<EOS>
So
she
went
to
London
cheerfully
,
to
witness
with
pride
all
the
little
triumphs
won
by
her
sister
's
beauty
;
to
hear
,
and
never
tire
of
hearing
,
all
that
admiring
friends
could
say
in
her
sister
's
praise
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
season
Mr.
Welwyn
and
his
daughters
returned
for
a
short
time
to
the
country
;
then
left
home
again
to
spend
the
latter
part
of
the
autumn
and
the
beginning
of
the
winter
in
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
They
took
with
them
excellent
letters
of
introduction
,
and
saw
a
great
deal
of
the
best
society
in
Paris
,
foreign
as
well
as
English
.
<EOS>
At
one
of
the
first
of
the
evening
parties
which
they
attended
,
the
general
topic
of
conversation
was
the
conduct
of
a
certain
French
nobleman
,
the
Baron
Franval
,
who
had
returned
to
his
native
country
after
a
long
absence
,
and
who
was
spoken
of
in
terms
of
high
eulogy
by
the
majority
of
the
guests
present
.
<EOS>
The
history
of
who
Franval
was
,
and
of
what
he
had
done
,
was
readily
communicated
to
Mr.
Welwyn
and
his
daughters
,
and
was
briefly
this
:
  
<EOS>
The
baron
inherited
little
from
his
ancestors
besides
his
high
rank
and
his
ancient
pedigree
.
<EOS>
On
the
death
of
his
parents
,
he
and
his
two
unmarried
sisters
(
their
only
surviving
children
)
found
the
small
territorial
property
of
the
Franvals
,
in
Normandy
,
barely
productive
enough
to
afford
a
comfortable
subsistence
for
the
three
.
<EOS>
The
baron
,
then
a
young
man
of
three
-
and
-
twenty
endeavored
to
obtain
such
military
or
civil
employment
as
might
become
his
rank
;
but
,
although
the
Bourbons
were
at
that
time
restored
to
the
throne
of
France
,
his
efforts
were
ineffectual
.
<EOS>
Either
his
interest
at
court
was
bad
,
or
secret
enemies
were
at
work
to
oppose
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
He
failed
to
obtain
even
the
slightest
favor
;
and
,
irritated
by
undeserved
neglect
,
resolved
to
leave
France
,
and
seek
occupation
for
his
energies
in
foreign
countries
,
where
his
rank
would
be
no
bar
to
his
bettering
his
fortunes
,
if
he
pleased
,
by
engaging
in
commercial
pursuits
.
  
<EOS>
An
opportunity
of
the
kind
that
he
wanted
unexpectedly
offered
itself
.
<EOS>
He
left
his
sisters
in
care
of
an
old
male
relative
of
the
family
at
the
chateau
in
Normandy
,
and
sailed
,
in
the
first
instance
,
to
the
West
Indies
;
afterward
extending
his
wanderings
to
the
continent
of
South
America
,
and
there
engaging
in
mining
transactions
on
a
very
large
scale
.
<EOS>
After
fifteen
years
of
absence
(
during
the
latter
part
of
which
time
false
reports
of
his
death
had
reached
Normandy
)
,
he
had
just
returned
to
France
,
having
realized
a
handsome
independence
,
with
which
he
proposed
to
widen
the
limits
of
his
ancestral
property
,
and
to
give
his
sisters
(
who
were
still
,
like
himself
,
unmarried
)
all
the
luxuries
and
advantages
that
affluence
could
bestow
.
<EOS>
The
baron
's
independent
spirit
and
generous
devotion
to
the
honor
of
his
family
and
the
happiness
of
his
surviving
relatives
were
themes
of
general
admiration
in
most
of
the
social
circles
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
He
was
expected
to
arrive
in
the
capital
every
day
;
and
it
was
naturally
enough
predicted
that
his
reception
in
society
there
could
not
fail
to
be
of
the
most
flattering
and
most
brilliant
kind
.
  
<EOS>
The
Welwyns
listened
to
this
story
with
some
little
interest
;
Rosamond
,
who
was
very
romantic
,
being
especially
attracted
by
it
,
and
openly
avowing
to
her
father
and
sister
,
when
they
got
back
to
their
hotel
<EOS>
,
that
she
felt
as
ardent
a
curiosity
as
anybody
to
see
the
adventurous
and
generous
baron
.
<EOS>
The
desire
was
soon
gratified
.
<EOS>
Franval
came
to
Paris
,
as
had
been
anticipated
 
was
introduced
to
the
Welwyns
 
met
them
constantly
in
society
 
made
no
favorable
impression
on
Ida
,
but
won
the
good
opinion
of
Rosamond
from
the
first
;
and
was
regarded
with
such
high
approval
by
their
father
,
that
when
he
mentioned
his
intentions
of
visiting
England
in
the
spring
of
the
new
year
,
he
was
cordially
invited
to
spend
the
hunting
season
at
Glenwith
Grange
.
  
<EOS>
I
came
back
from
Germany
about
the
same
time
that
the
Welwyns
returned
from
Paris
,
and
at
once
set
myself
to
improve
my
neighborly
intimacy
with
the
family
.
<EOS>
I
was
very
fond
of
Ida
;
more
fond
,
perhaps
,
than
my
vanity
will
now
allow
me
to
;
but
that
is
of
no
consequence
.
<EOS>
It
is
much
more
to
the
purpose
to
tell
you
that
I
heard
the
whole
of
the
baron
's
story
enthusiastically
related
by
Mr.
Welwyn
and
Rosamond
;
that
he
came
to
the
Grange
at
the
appointed
time
;
that
I
was
introduced
to
him
;
and
that
he
produced
as
unfavorable
an
impression
upon
me
as
he
had
already
produced
upon
Ida
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
whimsical
enough
;
but
I
really
could
not
tell
why
I
disliked
him
,
though
I
could
account
very
easily
,
according
to
my
own
notions
,
for
his
winning
the
favor
and
approval
of
Rosamond
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
was
certainly
a
handsome
man
as
far
as
features
went
;
he
had
a
winning
gentleness
and
graceful
respect
in
his
manner
when
he
spoke
to
women
;
and
he
sang
remarkably
well
,
with
one
of
the
sweetest
tenor
voices
I
ever
heard
.
<EOS>
These
qualities
alone
were
quite
sufficient
to
attract
any
girl
of
Rosamond
's
disposition
;
and
I
certainly
never
wondered
why
he
was
a
favorite
of
hers
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
as
to
her
father
,
the
baron
was
not
only
fitted
to
win
his
sympathy
and
regard
in
the
field
,
by
proving
himself
an
ardent
sportsman
and
an
excellent
rider
;
but
was
also
,
in
virtue
of
some
of
his
minor
personal
peculiarities
,
just
the
man
to
gain
the
friendship
of
his
host
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Welwyn
was
as
ridiculously
prejudiced
as
most
weak
-
headed
Englishmen
are
,
on
the
subject
of
foreigners
in
general
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
visit
to
Paris
,
the
vulgar
notion
of
a
Frenchman
continued
to
be
his
notion
,
both
while
he
was
in
France
and
when
he
returned
from
it
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
baron
was
as
unlike
the
traditional
"
Mounseer
"
of
English
songs
,
plays
,
and
satires
,
as
a
man
could
well
be
;
and
it
was
on
account
of
this
very
dissimilarity
that
Mr.
Welwyn
first
took
a
violent
fancy
to
him
,
and
then
invited
him
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
Franval
spoke
English
remarkably
well
;
wore
neither
beard
,
mustache
,
nor
whiskers
;
kept
his
hair
cut
almost
unbecomingly
short
;
dressed
in
the
extreme
of
plainness
and
modest
good
taste
;
talked
 
little
in
general
society
;
uttered
his
words
,
when
he
did
speak
,
with
singular
calmness
and
deliberation
;
and
,
to
crown
all
,
had
the
greater
part
of
his
acquired
property
invested
in
English
securities
.
<EOS>
In
Mr.
Welwyn
's
estimation
,
such
a
man
as
this
was
a
perfect
miracle
of
a
Frenchman
,
and
he
admired
and
encouraged
him
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
said
that
I
disliked
him
,
yet
could
not
assign
a
reason
for
my
dislike
;
and
I
can
only
repeat
it
now
.
<EOS>
He
was
remarkably
polite
to
me
;
we
often
rode
together
in
hunting
,
and
sat
near
each
other
at
the
Grange
table
;
but
I
could
never
become
familiar
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
always
gave
me
the
idea
of
a
man
who
had
some
mental
reservation
in
saying
the
most
trifling
thing
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
constant
restraint
,
hardly
perceptible
to
most
people
,
but
plainly
visible
,
nevertheless
,
to
me
,
which
seemed
to
accompany
his
lightest
words
,
and
to
hang
about
his
most
familiar
manner
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
no
just
reason
for
my
secretly
disliking
and
distrusting
him
as
I
did
.
<EOS>
Ida
said
as
much
to
me
,
<EOS>
I
remember
,
when
I
confessed
to
her
what
my
feelings
toward
him
were
,
and
tried
(
but
vainly
)
to
induce
her
to
be
equally
candid
with
me
in
return
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
shrink
from
the
tacit
condemnation
of
Rosamond
's
opinion
which
such
a
confidence
on
her
part
would
have
implied
.
<EOS>
And
yet
she
watched
the
growth
of
that
opinion
 
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
growth
of
her
sister
's
liking
for
the
baron
 
with
an
apprehension
and
sorrow
which
she
tried
fruitlessly
to
conceal
.
<EOS>
Even
her
father
began
to
notice
that
her
spirits
were
not
so
good
as
usual
,
and
to
suspect
the
cause
of
her
melancholy
.
<EOS>
I
remember
he
jested
,
with
all
the
dense
insensibility
of
a
stupid
man
,
about
Ida
having
invariably
been
jealous
,
from
a
child
,
if
Rosamond
looked
kindly
upon
anybody
except
her
elder
sister
.
  
<EOS>
The
spring
began
to
get
far
advanced
toward
summer
.
<EOS>
Franval
paid
a
visit
to
London
;
came
back
in
the
middle
of
the
season
to
Glenwith
Grange
;
wrote
to
put
off
his
departure
for
France
;
and
at
last
(
not
at
all
to
the
surprise
of
anybody
who
was
intimate
with
the
Welwyns
)
proposed
to
Rosamond
,
and
was
accepted
.
<EOS>
He
was
candor
and
generosity
itself
when
the
preliminaries
of
the
marriage
-
settlement
were
under
discussion
.
<EOS>
He
quite
overpowered
Mr.
Welwyn
and
the
lawyers
with
references
,
papers
,
and
statements
of
the
distribution
and
extent
of
his
property
,
which
were
found
to
be
perfectly
correct
.
<EOS>
His
sisters
were
written
to
,
and
returned
the
most
cordial
answers
;
saying
that
the
state
of
their
health
would
not
allow
them
to
come
to
England
for
the
marriage
;
but
adding
a
warm
invitation
to
Normandy
for
the
bride
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
in
short
,
could
be
more
straightforward
and
satisfactory
than
the
baron
's
behavior
,
and
the
testimonies
to
his
worth
and
integrity
which
the
news
of
the
approaching
marriage
produced
from
his
relatives
and
his
friends
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
joyless
face
at
the
Grange
now
was
Ida
's
.
<EOS>
At
any
time
it
would
have
been
a
hard
trial
to
her
to
resign
that
first
and
foremost
place
which
she
had
held
since
childhood
in
her
sister
's
heart
,
as
she
knew
she
must
resign
it
when
Rosamond
married
.
<EOS>
But
,
secretly
disliking
and
distrusting
Franval
as
she
did
,
the
thought
that
he
was
soon
to
become
the
husband
of
her
beloved
sister
filled
her
with
a
vague
sense
of
terror
which
she
could
not
explain
to
herself
;
which
it
was
imperatively
necessary
that
she
should
conceal
;
and
which
,
on
those
very
accounts
,
became
a
daily
and
hourly
torment
to
her
that
was
almost
more
than
she
could
bear
.
  
<EOS>
One
consolation
alone
supported
her
:
<EOS>
Rosamond
and
<EOS>
she
were
not
to
be
separated
.
<EOS>
She
knew
that
the
baron
secretly
disliked
her
as
much
as
she
disliked
him
;
she
knew
that
she
must
bid
farewell
to
the
brighter
and
happier
part
of
her
life
on
the
day
when
she
went
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
her
sister
's
husband
;
but
,
true
to
the
promise
made
years
and
years
ago
by
her
dying
mother
's
bed
 
true
to
the
affection
which
was
the
ruling
and
beautiful
feeling
of
her
whole
existence
 
she
never
hesitated
about
indulging
Rosamond
's
wish
,
when
the
girl
,
in
her
bright
,
light
-
hearted
way
,
said
that
she
could
never
get
on
comfortably
in
the
marriage
state
unless
she
had
Ida
to
live
with
her
and
help
her
just
the
same
as
ever
.
<EOS>
The
baron
was
too
polite
a
man
even
to
look
dissatisfied
when
he
heard
of
the
proposed
arrangement
;
and
it
was
therefore
settled
from
the
beginning
that
Ida
was
always
to
live
with
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
took
place
in
the
summer
,
and
the
bride
and
bridegroom
went
to
spend
their
honeymoon
in
Cumberland
.
<EOS>
On
their
return
to
Glenwith
Grange
,
a
visit
to
the
baron
's
sisters
,
in
Normandy
,
was
talked
of
;
but
the
execution
of
this
project
was
suddenly
and
disastrously
suspended
by
the
death
of
Mr.
Welwyn
,
from
an
attack
of
pleurisy
.
  
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
calamity
,
the
projected
journey
was
of
course
deferred
;
and
when
autumn
and
the
shooting
season
came
,
the
baron
was
unwilling
to
leave
the
well
-
stocked
preserves
of
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
,
indeed
,
to
grow
less
and
less
inclined
,
as
time
advanced
,
for
the
trip
to
Normandy
;
and
wrote
excuse
after
excuse
to
his
sisters
,
when
letters
arrived
from
them
urging
him
to
pay
the
promised
visit
.
<EOS>
In
the
winter
-
time
,
he
said
he
would
not
allow
his
wife
to
risk
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
In
the
spring
,
his
health
was
pronounced
to
be
delicate
.
<EOS>
In
the
genial
summer
-
time
,
the
accomplishment
of
the
proposed
visit
would
be
impossible
,
for
at
that
period
the
baroness
expected
to
become
a
mother
.
<EOS>
Such
were
the
apologies
which
Franval
seemed
almost
glad
to
be
able
to
send
to
his
sisters
in
France
.
  
<EOS>
The
marriage
was
,
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
term
,
a
happy
one
.
<EOS>
The
baron
,
though
he
never
altogether
lost
the
strange
restraint
and
reserve
of
his
manner
,
was
,
in
his
quiet
,
peculiar
way
,
the
fondest
and
kindest
of
husbands
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
town
occasionally
on
business
,
but
always
seemed
glad
to
return
to
the
baroness
;
he
never
varied
in
the
politeness
of
his
bearing
toward
his
wife
's
sister
;
he
behaved
with
the
most
courteous
hospitality
toward
all
the
friends
of
the
Welwyns
;
in
short
,
he
thoroughly
justified
the
good
opinion
which
Rosamond
and
her
father
had
formed
of
him
when
they
first
met
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
And
yet
no
experience
of
his
character
thoroughly
re
-
assured
Ida
.
<EOS>
Months
passed
on
quietly
and
pleasantly
;
and
still
that
secret
sadness
,
that
indefinable
,
unreasonable
apprehension
on
Rosamond
's
account
,
hung
heavily
on
her
sister
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
beginning
of
the
first
summer
months
,
a
little
domestic
inconvenience
happened
,
which
showed
the
baroness
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
her
husband
's
temper
could
be
seriously
ruffled
 
and
that
by
the
veriest
trifle
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
in
two
French
provincial
newspapers
 
one
published
at
Bordeaux
and
the
other
at
Havre
.
<EOS>
He
always
opened
these
journals
the
moment
they
came
,
looked
at
one
particular
column
of
each
with
the
deepest
attention
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
then
carelessly
threw
them
aside
into
his
waste
-
paper
basket
.
<EOS>
His
wife
and
her
sister
were
at
first
rather
surprised
at
the
manner
in
which
he
read
his
two
papers
;
but
they
thought
no
more
of
it
when
he
explained
that
he
only
took
them
in
to
consult
them
about
French
commercial
intelligence
,
which
might
be
,
occasionally
,
of
importance
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
These
papers
were
published
weekly
.
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
to
which
I
have
just
referred
,
the
Bordeaux
paper
came
on
the
proper
day
,
as
usual
;
but
the
Havre
paper
never
made
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
This
trifling
circumstance
seemed
to
make
the
baron
seriously
uneasy
.
<EOS>
He
wrote
off
directly
to
the
country
post
-
office
and
to
the
newspaper
agent
in
London
.
<EOS>
His
wife
,
astonished
to
see
his
tranquillity
so
completely
overthrown
by
so
slight
a
cause
,
tried
to
restore
his
good
humor
by
jesting
with
him
about
the
missing
newspaper
.
<EOS>
He
replied
by
the
first
angry
and
unfeeling
words
that
she
had
heard
issue
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
She
was
then
within
about
six
weeks
of
her
confinement
,
and
very
unfit
to
bear
harsh
answers
from
anybody
 
least
of
all
from
her
husband
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
no
answer
came
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
the
third
,
the
baron
rode
off
to
the
post
town
to
make
inquiries
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
he
had
gone
,
a
strange
gentleman
came
to
the
Grange
and
asked
to
see
the
baroness
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
that
she
was
not
well
enough
to
receive
visitors
,
he
sent
up
a
message
that
his
business
was
of
great
importance
and
that
he
would
wait
downstairs
for
a
second
answer
.
  
<EOS>
On
receiving
this
message
,
Rosamond
turned
,
as
usual
,
to
her
elder
sister
for
advice
.
<EOS>
Ida
went
downstairs
immediately
to
see
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
What
I
am
now
about
to
tell
you
of
the
extraordinary
interview
which
took
place
between
them
,
and
of
the
shocking
events
that
followed
it
,
I
have
heard
from
Miss
Welwyn
's
own
lips
.
  
<EOS>
She
felt
unaccountably
nervous
when
she
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
bowed
very
politely
,
and
asked
,
in
a
foreign
accent
,
if
she
were
the
Baroness
Franval
.
<EOS>
She
set
him
right
on
this
point
,
and
told
him
she
attended
to
all
matters
of
business
for
the
baroness
;
adding
that
,
if
his
errand
at
all
concerned
her
sister
's
husband
,
the
baron
was
not
then
at
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
stranger
answered
that
he
was
aware
of
it
when
he
called
,
and
that
the
unpleasant
business
on
which
he
came
could
not
be
confided
to
the
baron
 
at
least
,
in
the
first
instance
.
  
<EOS>
She
asked
why
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
there
to
explain
;
and
expressed
himself
as
feeling
greatly
relieved
at
having
to
open
his
business
to
her
,
because
she
would
,
doubtless
,
be
best
able
to
prepare
her
sister
for
the
bad
news
that
he
was
,
unfortunately
,
obliged
to
bring
.
<EOS>
The
sudden
faintness
which
overcame
her
,
as
he
spoke
those
words
,
prevented
her
from
addressing
him
in
return
.
<EOS>
He
poured
out
some
water
for
her
from
a
bottle
which
happened
to
be
standing
on
the
table
,
and
asked
if
he
might
depend
on
her
fortitude
.
<EOS>
She
tried
to
say
"
Yes
"
;
but
the
violent
throbbing
of
her
heart
seemed
to
choke
her
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
foreign
newspaper
from
his
pocket
,
saying
that
he
was
a
secret
agent
of
the
French
police
 
that
the
paper
was
the
Havre
Journal
,
for
the
past
week
,
and
that
it
had
been
expressly
kept
from
reaching
the
baron
,
as
usual
,
through
his
(
the
agent
's
)
interference
.
<EOS>
He
then
opened
the
newspaper
,
and
begged
that
she
would
nerve
herself
sufficiently
(
for
her
sister
's
sake
)
to
read
certain
lines
,
which
would
give
her
some
hint
of
the
business
that
brought
him
there
.
<EOS>
He
pointed
to
the
passage
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
It
was
among
the
"
Shipping
Entries
,
"
and
was
thus
expressed
:
  
"
Arrived
,
the
Berenice
,
from
San
Francisco
,
with
a
valuable
cargo
of
hides
.
<EOS>
She
brings
one
passenger
,
the
Baron
Franval
,
of
Chateau
Franval
,
in
Normandy
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Miss
Welwyn
read
the
entry
,
her
heart
,
which
had
been
throbbing
violently
but
the
moment
before
,
seemed
suddenly
to
cease
from
all
action
,
and
she
began
to
shiver
,
though
it
was
a
warm
June
evening
.
<EOS>
The
agent
held
the
tumbler
to
her
lips
,
and
made
her
drink
a
little
of
the
water
,
entreating
her
very
earnestly
to
take
courage
and
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
sat
down
,
and
referred
again
to
the
entry
,
every
word
he
uttered
seeming
to
burn
itself
in
forever
(
as
she
expressed
it
)
on
her
memory
and
her
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
:
"
It
has
been
ascertained
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
that
there
is
no
mistake
about
the
name
in
the
lines
you
have
just
read
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
as
certain
as
that
we
are
here
,
that
there
is
only
one
Baron
Franval
now
alive
.
<EOS>
The
question
,
therefore
,
is
,
whether
the
passenger
by
the
Berenice
is
the
true
baron
,
or
 
I
beg
you
most
earnestly
to
bear
with
me
and
to
compose
yourself
 
or
the
husband
of
your
sister
.
<EOS>
The
person
who
arrived
last
week
at
Havre
was
scouted
as
an
impostor
by
the
ladies
at
the
chateau
,
the
moment
he
presented
himself
there
as
the
brother
,
returning
to
them
after
sixteen
years
of
absence
.
<EOS>
The
authorities
were
communicated
with
,
and
I
and
my
assistants
were
instantly
sent
for
from
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
wasted
no
time
in
questioning
the
supposed
impostor
.
<EOS>
He
either
was
,
or
affected
to
be
,
in
a
perfect
frenzy
of
grief
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
We
just
ascertained
,
from
competent
witnesses
,
that
he
bore
an
extraordinary
resemblance
to
the
real
baron
,
and
that
he
was
perfectly
familiar
with
places
and
persons
in
and
about
the
chateau
;
we
just
ascertained
that
,
and
then
proceeded
to
confer
with
the
local
authorities
,
and
to
examine
their
private
entries
of
suspected
persons
in
their
jurisdiction
,
ranging
back
over
a
past
period
of
twenty
years
or
more
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
entries
thus
consulted
contained
these
particulars
:
"
Hector
Auguste
Monbrun
,
son
of
a
respectable
proprietor
in
Normandy
.
<EOS>
Well
educated
;
gentleman
-
like
manners
.
<EOS>
On
bad
terms
with
his
family
.
<EOS>
Character
:
<EOS>
bold
,
cunning
,
unscrupulous
,
self
-
possessed
.
<EOS>
Is
a
clever
mimic
.
<EOS>
May
be
easily
recognized
by
his
striking
likeness
to
the
Baron
Franval
.
<EOS>
Imprisoned
at
twenty
for
theft
and
assault
.
"
<EOS>
"
  
Miss
Welwyn
saw
the
agent
look
up
at
her
after
he
had
read
this
extract
from
the
police
-
book
,
to
ascertain
if
she
was
still
able
to
listen
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
asked
,
with
some
appearance
of
alarm
,
as
their
eyes
met
,
if
she
would
like
some
more
water
.
<EOS>
She
was
just
able
to
make
a
sign
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
He
took
a
second
extract
from
his
pocket
-
book
,
and
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
said
:
"
The
next
entry
under
the
same
name
was
dated
four
years
later
,
and
ran
thus
,
"
H.
A.
Monbrun
,
condemned
to
the
galleys
for
life
,
for
assassination
,
and
other
crimes
not
officially
necessary
to
be
here
specified
.
<EOS>
Escaped
from
custody
at
Toulon
.
<EOS>
Is
known
,
since
the
expiration
of
his
first
term
of
imprisonment
,
to
have
allowed
his
beard
to
grow
,
and
to
have
worn
his
hair
long
,
with
the
intention
of
rendering
it
impossible
for
those
acquainted
with
him
in
his
native
province
to
recognize
him
,
as
heretofore
,
by
his
likeness
to
the
Baron
Franval
.
<EOS>
"
There
were
more
particulars
added
,
not
important
enough
for
extract
.
<EOS>
We
immediately
examined
the
supposed
impostor
;
for
,
if
he
was
Monbrun
,
we
knew
that
we
should
find
on
his
shoulder
the
two
letters
of
the
convict
brand
,
"
T.
F.
,
"
standing
for
Travaux
Forces
.
<EOS>
After
the
minutest
examination
with
the
mechanical
and
chemical
tests
used
on
such
occasions
,
not
the
slightest
trace
of
the
brand
was
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
The
moment
this
astounding
discovery
was
made
,
I
started
to
lay
an
embargo
on
the
forthcoming
numbers
of
the
Havre
Journal
for
that
week
,
which
were
about
to
be
sent
to
the
English
agent
in
London
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
at
Havre
on
Saturday
(
the
morning
of
publication
)
,
in
time
to
execute
my
design
.
<EOS>
I
waited
there
long
enough
to
communicate
by
telegraph
with
my
superiors
in
Paris
,
then
hastened
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
What
my
errand
here
is
,
you
may
"
  
He
might
have
gone
on
speaking
for
some
moments
longer
;
but
Miss
Welwyn
heard
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Her
first
sensation
of
returning
consciousness
was
the
feeling
that
water
was
being
sprinkled
on
her
face
.
<EOS>
Then
she
saw
that
all
the
windows
in
the
room
had
been
set
wide
open
,
to
give
her
air
;
and
that
she
and
the
agent
were
still
alone
.
<EOS>
At
first
she
felt
bewildered
,
and
hardly
knew
who
he
was
;
but
he
soon
recalled
to
her
mind
the
horrible
realities
that
had
brought
him
there
,
by
apologizing
for
not
having
summoned
assistance
when
she
fainted
.
<EOS>
He
said
it
was
of
the
last
importance
,
in
Franval
's
absence
,
that
no
one
in
the
house
should
imagine
that
anything
unusual
was
taking
place
in
it
.
<EOS>
Then
,
after
giving
her
an
interval
of
a
minute
or
two
to
collect
what
little
strength
she
had
left
,
he
added
that
he
would
not
increase
her
sufferings
by
saying
anything
more
,
just
then
,
on
the
shocking
subject
of
the
investigation
which
it
was
his
duty
to
make
 
that
he
would
leave
her
to
recover
herself
,
and
to
consider
what
was
the
best
course
to
be
taken
with
the
baroness
in
the
present
terrible
emergency
 
and
that
he
would
privately
return
to
the
house
between
eight
and
nine
o'clock
that
evening
,
ready
to
act
as
Miss
Welwyn
wished
,
and
to
afford
her
and
her
sister
any
aid
and
protection
of
which
they
might
stand
in
need
.
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
bowed
,
and
noiselessly
quitted
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
For
the
first
few
awful
minutes
after
she
was
left
alone
,
Miss
Welwyn
sat
helpless
and
speechless
;
utterly
numbed
in
heart
,
and
mind
,
and
body
 
then
a
sort
of
instinct
(
she
was
incapable
of
thinking
)
seemed
to
urge
her
to
conceal
the
fearful
news
from
her
sister
as
long
as
possible
.
<EOS>
She
ran
upstairs
to
Rosamond
's
sitting
-
room
,
and
called
through
the
door
(
for
she
dared
not
trust
herself
in
her
sister
's
presence
)
that
the
visitor
had
come
on
some
troublesome
business
from
their
 
late
father
's
lawyers
,
and
that
she
was
going
to
shut
herself
up
,
and
write
some
long
letters
in
connection
with
that
business
.
<EOS>
After
she
had
got
into
her
own
room
,
she
was
never
sensible
of
how
time
was
passing
 
never
conscious
of
any
feeling
within
her
,
except
a
baseless
,
helpless
hope
that
the
French
police
might
yet
be
proved
to
have
made
some
terrible
mistake
 
until
she
heard
a
violent
shower
of
rain
come
on
a
little
after
sunset
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
rain
,
and
the
freshness
it
brought
with
it
in
the
air
,
seemed
to
awaken
her
as
if
from
a
painful
and
a
fearful
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
power
of
reflection
returned
to
her
;
her
heart
heaved
and
bounded
with
an
overwhelming
terror
,
as
the
thought
of
Rosamond
came
back
vividly
to
it
;
her
memory
recurred
despairingly
to
the
long
-
past
day
of
her
mother
's
death
,
and
to
the
farewell
promise
she
had
made
by
her
mother
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
She
burst
into
an
hysterical
passion
of
weeping
that
seemed
to
be
tearing
her
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
it
she
heard
the
clatter
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
in
the
courtyard
,
and
knew
that
Rosamond
's
husband
had
come
back
.
  
<EOS>
Dipping
her
handkerchief
in
cold
water
,
and
passing
it
over
her
eyes
as
she
left
the
room
,
she
instantly
hastened
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
the
daylight
was
fading
in
the
old
-
fashioned
chamber
that
Rosamond
occupied
.
<EOS>
Before
they
could
say
two
words
to
each
other
,
Franval
was
in
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
violently
irritated
;
said
that
he
had
waited
for
the
arrival
of
the
mail
 
that
the
missing
newspaper
had
not
come
by
it
 
that
he
had
got
wet
through
 
that
he
felt
a
shivering
fit
coming
on
 
and
that
he
believed
he
had
caught
a
violent
cold
.
<EOS>
His
wife
anxiously
suggested
some
simple
remedies
.
<EOS>
He
roughly
interrupted
her
,
saying
there
was
but
one
remedy
,
the
remedy
of
going
to
bed
;
and
so
left
them
without
another
word
.
<EOS>
She
just
put
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
,
and
said
softly
to
her
sister
,
"
How
he
is
changed
!
"
<EOS>
then
spoke
no
more
.
<EOS>
They
sat
silent
for
half
an
hour
or
longer
.
<EOS>
After
that
,
Rosamond
went
affectionately
and
forgivingly
to
see
how
her
husband
was
.
<EOS>
She
returned
,
saying
that
he
was
in
bed
,
and
in
a
deep
,
heavy
sleep
;
and
predicting
hopefully
that
he
would
wake
up
quite
well
the
next
morning
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
more
the
clock
stuck
nine
;
and
Ida
heard
the
servant
's
step
ascending
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
suspected
what
his
errand
was
,
and
went
out
to
meet
him
.
<EOS>
Her
presentiment
had
not
deceived
her
;
the
police
agent
had
arrived
,
and
was
waiting
for
her
downstairs
.
  
<EOS>
He
asked
her
if
she
had
said
anything
to
her
sister
,
or
had
thought
of
any
plan
of
action
,
the
moment
she
entered
the
room
;
and
,
on
receiving
a
reply
in
the
negative
,
inquired
,
further
,
if
"
the
baron
"
had
come
home
yet
.
<EOS>
She
answered
that
he
had
;
that
he
was
ill
and
tired
,
and
vexed
,
and
that
he
had
gone
to
bed
.
<EOS>
The
agent
asked
in
an
eager
whisper
if
she
knew
that
he
was
asleep
,
and
alone
in
bed
?
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
received
her
reply
,
said
that
he
must
go
up
into
the
bedroom
directly
.
  
<EOS>
She
began
to
feel
the
faintness
coming
over
her
again
,
and
with
it
sensations
of
loathing
and
terror
that
she
could
neither
express
to
others
nor
define
to
herself
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
if
she
hesitated
to
let
him
avail
himself
of
this
unexpected
opportunity
,
her
scruples
might
lead
to
fatal
results
He
reminded
her
that
if
"
the
baron
"
were
really
the
convict
Monbrun
,
the
claims
of
society
and
of
justice
demanded
that
he
should
be
discovered
by
the
first
available
means
;
and
that
if
he
were
not
 
if
some
inconceivable
mistake
had
really
been
committed
 
then
such
a
plan
for
getting
immediately
at
the
truth
as
was
now
proposed
would
insure
the
delivery
of
an
innocent
man
from
suspicion
;
and
at
the
same
time
spare
him
the
knowledge
that
he
had
ever
been
suspected
.
<EOS>
This
last
argument
had
its
effect
on
Miss
Welwyn
.
<EOS>
The
baseless
,
helpless
hope
that
the
French
authorities
might
yet
be
proved
to
be
in
error
,
which
she
had
already
felt
in
her
own
room
,
returned
to
her
now
.
<EOS>
She
suffered
the
agent
to
lead
her
upstairs
.
  
<EOS>
He
took
the
candle
from
her
hand
when
she
pointed
to
the
door
;
opened
it
softly
;
and
,
leaving
it
ajar
,
went
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
through
the
gap
with
a
feverish
,
horror
-
struck
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Franval
was
lying
on
his
side
in
a
profound
sleep
,
with
his
back
turned
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
agent
softly
placed
the
candle
upon
a
small
reading
-
table
between
the
door
and
the
bedside
,
softly
drew
down
the
bed
-
clothes
a
little
away
from
the
sleeper
's
back
,
then
took
a
pair
of
scissors
from
the
toilet
-
table
,
and
very
gently
and
slowly
began
to
cut
away
,
<EOS>
first
the
loose
folds
,
then
the
intervening
strips
of
linen
,
from
the
part
of
Franval
's
night
-
gown
that
was
over
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
When
the
upper
part
of
his
back
had
been
bared
in
this
way
,
the
agent
took
the
candle
and
held
it
near
the
flesh
.
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
heard
him
ejaculate
some
word
under
his
breath
,
then
saw
him
looking
round
to
where
she
was
standing
,
and
beckoning
to
her
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
Mechanically
she
obeyed
;
mechanically
she
looked
down
where
his
finger
was
pointing
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
convict
Monbrun
 
there
,
just
visible
under
the
bright
light
of
the
candle
,
were
<EOS>
the
fatal
letters
"
T.
F.
"
branded
on
the
villain
's
shoulder
!
  
<EOS>
Though
she
could
neither
move
nor
speak
,
the
horror
of
this
discovery
did
not
deprive
her
of
her
consciousness
.
<EOS>
She
saw
the
agent
softly
draw
up
the
bed
-
clothes
again
into
their
proper
position
,
replace
the
scissors
on
the
toilet
-
table
,
and
take
from
it
a
bottle
of
smelling
-
salts
.
<EOS>
She
felt
him
removing
her
from
the
bedroom
,
and
helping
her
quickly
downstairs
,
giving
her
the
salts
to
smell
to
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
When
they
were
alone
again
,
he
said
,
with
the
first
appearance
of
agitation
that
he
had

Now

God
's

collect
all
your

me

<EOS>
You
and
your

had
better
leave

immediately

<EOS>
Have
you
any

in

with
whom
you
could
take

<EOS>
"
They
had
none

<EOS>
"
What
is
the
name
of
the
nearest
town
where
you
could
get
good
accommodation
for
the
night
?
<EOS>
"
Harleybrook
(
he
wrote
the
name
down
on
his
tablets
)
.
<EOS>
"
How
far
off
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
Twelve
miles
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
have
the
carriage
out
at
once
,
to
go
there
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
,
leaving
me
to
pass
the
night
here
.
<EOS>
I
will
communicate
with
you
to
-
morrow
at
the
principal
hotel
.
<EOS>
Can
you
compose
yourself
sufficiently
to
be
able
to
tell
the
head
servant
,
<EOS>
if
I
ring
for
him
,
that
he
is
to
obey
my
orders
till
further
notice
?
<EOS>
"
The
servant
was
summoned
,
and
received
his
instructions
,
the
agent
going
out
with
him
to
see
that
the
carriage
was
got
ready
quietly
and
quickly
.
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
went
upstairs
to
her
sister
.
  
<EOS>
How
the
fearful
news
was
first
broken
to
Rosamond
,
I
can
not
relate
to
you
.
<EOS>
Miss
Welwyn
has
never
confided
to
me
,
has
never
confided
to
anybody
,
what
happened
at
the
interview
between
her
sister
and
herself
that
night
.
<EOS>
I
can
tell
you
nothing
of
the
shock
they
both
suffered
,
except
that
the
younger
and
the
weaker
died
under
it
;
that
the
elder
and
the
stronger
has
never
recovered
from
it
,
and
never
will
.
  
<EOS>
They
went
away
the
same
night
,
with
one
attendant
,
to
Harleybrook
,
as
the
agent
had
advised
.
<EOS>
Before
daybreak
Rosamond
was
seized
with
the
pains
of
premature
labor
.
<EOS>
She
died
three
days
after
,
unconscious
of
the
horror
of
her
situation
,
wandering
in
her
mind
about
past
times
,
and
singing
old
tunes
that
Ida
had
taught
her
as
she
lay
in
her
sister
's
arms
.
  
<EOS>
The
child
was
born
alive
,
and
lives
still
.
<EOS>
You
saw
her
at
the
window
as
we
came
in
at
the
back
way
to
the
Grange
.
<EOS>
I
surprised
you
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
by
asking
you
not
to
speak
of
her
to
Miss
Welwyn
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
noticed
something
vacant
in
the
little
girl
's
expression
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
that
her
mind
is
more
vacant
still
.
<EOS>
If
"
idiot
"
did
not
sound
like
a
mocking
word
,
however
tenderly
and
pityingly
one
may
wish
to
utter
it
,
I
should
tell
you
that
the
poor
thing
had
been
an
idiot
from
her
birth
.
  
<EOS>
You
will
,
doubtless
,
want
to
hear
now
what
happened
at
Glenwith
Grange
after
Miss
Welwyn
and
her
sister
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
the
letter
which
the
police
agent
sent
the
next
morning
to
Harleybrook
;
and
,
speaking
from
my
recollection
of
that
,
I
shall
be
able
to
relate
all
you
can
desire
to
know
.
  
<EOS>
First
,
as
to
the
past
history
of
the
scoundrel
Monbrun
,
I
 
need
only
tell
you
that
he
was
identical
with
an
escaped
convict
,
who
,
for
a
long
term
of
years
,
had
successfully
eluded
the
vigilance
of
the
authorities
all
over
Europe
,
and
in
America
as
well
.
<EOS>
In
conjunction
with
two
accomplices
,
he
had
succeeded
in
possessing
himself
of
large
sums
of
money
by
the
most
criminal
means
.
<EOS>
He
also
acted
secretly
as
the
"
banker
"
of
his
convict
brethren
,
whose
dishonest
gains
were
all
confided
to
his
hands
for
safe
-
keeping
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
certainly
captured
,
on
venturing
back
to
France
,
along
with
his
two
associates
,
but
for
the
daring
imposture
in
which
he
took
refuge
;
and
which
,
if
the
true
Baron
Franval
had
really
died
abroad
,
as
was
reported
,
would
,
in
all
probability
,
never
have
been
found
out
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
his
extraordinary
likeness
to
the
baron
,
he
had
every
other
requisite
for
carrying
on
his
deception
successfully
.
<EOS>
Though
his
parents
were
not
wealthy
,
he
had
received
a
good
education
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
notorious
for
his
gentleman
-
like
manners
among
the
villainous
associates
of
his
crimes
and
excesses
,
that
they
nicknamed
him
"
the
Prince
.
<EOS>
"
All
his
early
life
had
been
passed
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Chateau
Franval
.
<EOS>
He
knew
what
were
the
circumstances
which
had
induced
the
baron
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
in
the
country
to
which
the
baron
had
emigrated
.
<EOS>
He
was
able
to
refer
familiarly
to
persons
and
localities
,
at
home
and
abroad
,
with
which
the
baron
was
sure
to
be
acquainted
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
he
had
an
expatriation
of
fifteen
years
to
plead
for
him
as
his
all
-
sufficient
excuse
,
if
he
made
any
slight
mistakes
before
the
baron
's
sisters
,
in
his
assumed
character
of
their
long
-
absent
brother
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
,
of
course
,
hardly
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
,
in
relation
to
this
part
of
the
subject
,
that
the
true
Franval
was
immediately
and
honorably
reinstated
in
the
family
rights
of
which
the
impostor
had
succeeded
for
a
time
in
depriving
him
.
  
<EOS>
According
to
Monbrun
's
own
account
,
he
had
married
poor
Rosamond
purely
for
love
;
and
the
probabilities
certainly
are
,
that
the
pretty
,
innocent
English
girl
had
really
struck
the
villain
's
fancy
for
the
time
;
and
that
the
easy
,
quiet
life
he
was
leading
at
the
Grange
pleased
him
,
by
contrast
with
his
perilous
and
vagabond
existence
of
former
days
.
<EOS>
What
might
have
happened
if
he
had
had
time
enough
to
grow
wearied
of
his
ill
-
fated
wife
and
his
English
home
,
it
is
now
useless
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
What
really
did
happen
on
the
morning
when
he
awoke
after
the
flight
of
Ida
and
her
sister
can
be
briefly
told
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
his
eyes
opened
they
rested
on
the
police
agent
,
sitting
quietly
by
the
bedside
,
with
a
loaded
pistol
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Monbrun
knew
immediately
that
he
was
discovered
;
but
he
never
for
an
instant
lost
the
self
-
possession
for
which
he
was
famous
.
<EOS>
He
said
he
wished
to
have
five
minutes
allowed
him
to
deliberate
quietly
in
bed
,
whether
he
should
resist
the
French
authorities
on
English
ground
,
and
so
gain
time
by
obliging
the
one
Government
to
apply
specially
to
have
him
delivered
up
by
the
other
 
or
whether
he
should
accept
the
terms
officially
offered
to
him
by
the
agent
,
if
he
quietly
allowed
himself
to
be
captured
.
<EOS>
He
chose
the
latter
course
 
it
was
suspected
,
because
he
wished
to
communicate
personally
with
some
of
his
convict
associates
in
France
,
whose
fraudulent
gains
were
in
his
keeping
,
and
because
he
felt
boastfully
confident
of
being
able
to
escape
again
,
whenever
he
pleased
.
<EOS>
Be
his
secret
motives
,
however
,
what
they
might
,
he
allowed
the
agent
to
conduct
him
peaceably
from
the
Grange
;
first
writing
a
farewell
letter
to
poor
Rosamond
,
full
of
heartless
French
sentiment
and
glib
sophistries
about
Fate
and
Society
.
<EOS>
His
own
fate
was
not
long
in
overtaking
him
.
<EOS>
He
attempted
to
escape
again
,
as
it
had
been
expected
he
would
,
and
was
shot
by
the
sentinel
on
duty
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
I
remember
hearing
that
the
bullet
entered
his
head
and
killed
him
on
the
spot
.
  
<EOS>
My
story
is
done
.
<EOS>
It
is
ten
years
now
since
Rosamond
was
buried
in
the
churchyard
yonder
;
and
it
is
ten
years
also
since
Miss
Welwyn
returned
to
be
the
lonely
inhabitant
of
Glenwith
Grange
.
<EOS>
She
now
lives
but
in
the
remembrances
that
it
calls
up
before
her
of
her
happier
existence
of
former
days
.
<EOS>
There
is
hardly
an
object
in
the
old
house
which
does
not
tenderly
and
solemnly
remind
her
of
the
mother
,
whose
last
wishes
she
lived
to
obey
;
of
the
sister
,
whose
happiness
was
once
her
dearest
earthly
care
.
<EOS>
Those
prints
that
you
noticed
on
the
library
walls
Rosamond
used
to
copy
in
the
past
time
,
when
her
pencil
was
often
guided
by
Ida
's
hand
.
<EOS>
Those
music
-
books
that
you
were
looking
over
,
she
and
her
mother
have
played
from
together
through
many
a
long
and
quiet
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
She
has
no
ties
now
to
bind
her
to
the
present
but
the
poor
child
whose
affliction
it
is
her
constant
effort
to
lighten
,
and
the
little
peasant
population
around
her
,
whose
humble
cares
and
wants
and
sorrows
she
is
always
ready
to
relieve
.
<EOS>
Far
and
near
her
modest
charities
have
penetrated
among
us
;
and
far
and
near
she
is
heartily
beloved
and
blessed
in
many
a
laborer
's
household
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
poor
man
's
hearth
,
not
in
this
village
only
,
but
for
miles
away
from
it
as
well
,
at
which
you
would
not
be
received
with
the
welcome
given
to
an
old
friend
,
if
you
only
told
the
cottagers
that
you
knew
the
Lady
of
Glenwith
Grange
!
  
<EOS>
PROLOGUE
TO
THE
FIFTH
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
piece
of
work
which
occupied
my
attention
after
taking
leave
of
Mr.
Garthwaite
,
offered
the
strongest
possible
contrast
to
the
task
which
had
last
engaged
me
.
<EOS>
Fresh
from
painting
a
bull
at
a
farmhouse
,
I
set
forth
to
copy
a
Holy
Family
,
by
Correggio
,
at
a
convent
of
nuns
.
<EOS>
People
who
go
to
the
Royal
Academy
Exhibition
,
and
see
pictures
by
famous
artists
,
painted
year
after
year
in
the
same
marked
style
which
first
made
them
celebrated
,
would
be
amazed
indeed
if
they
knew
what
a
Jack
-
of
-
all
-
trades
a
poor
painter
must
become
before
he
can
gain
his
daily
bread
.
  
<EOS>
The
picture
by
Correggio
which
I
was
now
commissioned
to
copy
had
been
lent
to
the
nuns
by
a
Catholic
gentleman
of
fortune
,
who
prized
it
as
the
gem
of
his
collection
,
and
who
had
never
before
trusted
it
out
of
his
own
hands
.
<EOS>
My
copy
,
when
completed
,
was
to
be
placed
over
the
high
altar
of
the
convent
chapel
;
and
my
work
throughout
its
progress
was
to
be
pursued
entirely
in
the
parlor
of
the
nunnery
,
and
always
in
the
watchful
presence
of
one
or
other
of
the
inmates
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
on
such
conditions
that
the
owner
of
the
Correggio
was
willing
to
trust
his
treasure
out
of
his
own
hands
,
and
to
suffer
it
to
be
copied
by
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
The
restrictions
he
imposed
,
which
I
thought
sufficiently
absurd
,
and
perhaps
offensively
suspicious
as
well
,
were
communicated
to
me
politely
enough
before
I
was
allowed
to
undertake
the
commission
.
<EOS>
Unless
I
was
inclined
to
submit
to
precautionary
regulations
which
would
affect
any
other
artist
exactly
as
they
affected
me
,
I
was
told
not
to
think
of
offering
to
make
the
copy
;
and
the
nuns
would
then
address
themselves
to
some
other
person
in
my
profession
.
<EOS>
After
a
day
's
consideration
,
I
submitted
to
the
restrictions
,
by
my
wife
's
advice
,
and
saved
the
nuns
the
trouble
of
making
application
for
a
copier
of
Correggio
in
any
other
quarter
.
  
<EOS>
I
found
the
convent
was
charmingly
situated
in
a
quiet
little
valley
in
the
West
of
England
.
<EOS>
The
parlor
in
which
I
was
to
paint
was
a
large
,
well
-
lighted
apartment
;
and
the
village
inn
,
about
half
a
mile
off
,
afforded
me
cheap
and
excellent
quarters
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
,
therefore
,
there
was
nothing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
picture
,
which
was
the
next
object
of
interest
to
me
,
I
was
surprised
to
find
that
the
copying
of
it
would
be
by
no
means
<EOS>
so
difficult
a
task
as
I
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
I
am
rather
of
a
revolutionary
spirit
in
matters
of
art
,
and
am
bold
enough
to
think
that
the
old
masters
have
their
faults
as
well
as
their
beauties
.
<EOS>
I
can
give
my
opinion
,
therefore
,
on
the
Correggio
at
the
convent
independently
at
least
.
<EOS>
Looked
at
technically
,
the
picture
was
a
fine
specimen
of
coloring
and
execution
;
but
looked
at
for
the
higher
merits
of
delicacy
,
elevation
,
and
feeling
for
the
subject
,
it
deserved
copying
as
little
as
the
most
commonplace
work
that
any
unlucky
modern
artist
ever
produced
.
<EOS>
The
faces
of
the
Holy
Family
not
only
failed
to
display
the
right
purity
and
tenderness
of
expression
,
but
absolutely
failed
to
present
any
expression
at
all
.
<EOS>
It
is
flat
heresy
to
say
so
,
but
the
valuable
Correggio
was
nevertheless
emphatically
,
and
,
in
so
many
words
,
a
very
uninteresting
picture
.
  
<EOS>
So
much
for
the
convent
and
the
work
that
I
was
to
do
in
it
.
<EOS>
My
next
anxiety
was
to
see
how
the
restrictions
imposed
on
me
were
to
be
carried
out
.
<EOS>
The
first
day
,
the
Mother
Superior
herself
mounted
guard
in
the
parlor
 
<EOS>
a
stern
,
silent
,
fanatical
-
looking
woman
,
who
seemed
determined
to
awe
me
and
make
me
uncomfortable
,
and
who
succeeded
thoroughly
in
the
execution
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
second
day
she
was
relieved
by
the
officiating
priest
of
the
convent
 
a
mild
,
melancholy
,
gentleman
-
like
man
,
with
whom
I
got
on
tolerably
well
.
<EOS>
The
third
day
,
I
had
for
overlooker
the
portress
of
the
house
 
<EOS>
a
dirty
,
dismal
,
deaf
,
old
woman
,
who
did
nothing
but
knit
stockings
and
chew
orris
-
root
.
<EOS>
The
fourth
day
,
a
middle
-
aged
nun
,
whom
I
heard
addressed
as
Mother
Martha
,
occupied
the
post
of
guardian
to
the
precious
Correggio
;
and
with
her
the
number
of
my
overlookers
terminated
.
<EOS>
She
,
and
the
portress
,
and
the
priest
,
and
the
Mother
Superior
,
relieved
each
other
with
military
regularity
,
until
I
had
put
the
last
touch
to
my
copy
.
<EOS>
I
found
them
ready
for
me
every
morning
on
entering
the
parlor
,
and
I
left
them
in
the
chair
of
observation
every
evening
on
quitting
it
.
<EOS>
As
for
any
young
and
beautiful
nuns
who
might
have
been
in
the
building
,
I
never
so
much
as
set
eyes
on
the
ends
of
their
veils
.
<EOS>
From
the
door
to
the
parlor
,
and
from
the
parlor
to
the
door
,
comprised
the
whole
of
my
experience
of
the
inside
of
the
convent
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
one
of
my
superintending
companions
with
whom
I
established
anything
like
a
familiar
acquaintance
was
Mother
Martha
.
<EOS>
She
had
no
outward
attractions
to
recommend
her
;
but
she
was
simple
,
good
-
humored
,
ready
to
gossip
,
and
inquisitive
to
a
perfectly
incredible
degree
.
<EOS>
Her
whole
life
had
been
passed
in
the
nunnery
;
she
was
thoroughly
accustomed
to
her
seclusion
,
thoroughly
content
with
the
monotonous
round
of
her
occupations
;
not
at
all
anxious
to
see
the
world
for
herself
;
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
insatiably
curious
to
know
all
about
it
from
others
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
question
connected
with
myself
,
my
wife
,
my
children
,
my
friends
,
my
profession
,
my
income
,
my
travels
,
my
favorite
amusements
,
and
even
my
favorite
sins
,
which
a
woman
could
ask
a
man
,
that
Mother
Martha
did
not
,
in
the
smallest
and
softest
of
voices
,
ask
of
me
.
<EOS>
Though
an
intelligent
,
well
-
informed
person
in
all
that
related
to
her
own
special
vocation
,
she
was
a
perfect
child
in
everything
else
.
<EOS>
I
constantly
caught
myself
talking
to
her
,
just
as
I
should
have
talked
at
home
to
one
of
my
own
little
girls
.
  
<EOS>
I
hope
no
one
will
think
that
,
in
expressing
myself
thus
,
I
am
writing
disparagingly
of
the
poor
nun
.
<EOS>
On
two
accounts
,
I
shall
always
feel
compassionately
and
gratefully
toward
Mother
Martha
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
only
person
in
the
convent
who
seemed
sincerely
anxious
to
make
her
presence
in
the
parlor
as
agreeable
to
me
as
possible
;
and
she
good
-
humoredly
told
me
the
story
which
it
is
my
object
in
these
pages
to
introduce
to
the
reader
.
<EOS>
In
both
ways
I
am
deeply
indebted
to
her
;
and
I
hope
always
to
remember
the
obligation
.
  
<EOS>
The
circumstances
under
which
the
story
came
to
be
related
to
me
may
be
told
in
very
few
words
.
  
<EOS>
The
interior
of
a
convent
parlor
being
a
complete
novelty
to
me
,
I
looked
around
with
some
interest
on
first
entering
my
painting
-
room
at
the
nunnery
.
<EOS>
There
was
but
little
in
it
to
excite
the
curiosity
of
any
one
.
<EOS>
The
floor
was
covered
with
common
matting
,
and
the
ceiling
with
plain
whitewash
.
<EOS>
The
furniture
was
of
the
simplest
kind
;
a
low
chair
with
a
praying
-
desk
fixed
to
the
back
,
and
a
finely
carved
oak
book
-
case
,
studded
all
over
with
brass
crosses
,
being
the
only
useful
objects
that
I
could
discern
which
had
any
conventional
character
about
them
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
ornaments
of
the
room
,
they
were
entirely
beyond
my
appreciation
.
<EOS>
I
could
feel
no
interest
in
the
colored
prints
of
saints
,
with
gold
platters
at
the
backs
of
their
heads
,
that
hung
on
the
wall
;
and
I
could
see
nothing
particularly
impressive
in
the
two
plain
little
alabaster
pots
for
holy
water
,
fastened
,
one
near
the
door
,
the
other
over
the
chimney
-
piece
.
<EOS>
The
only
object
,
indeed
,
in
the
whole
room
which
in
the
slightest
degree
attracted
my
curiosity
was
an
old
worm
-
eaten
wooden
cross
,
made
in
the
rudest
manner
,
hanging
by
itself
on
a
slip
of
wall
between
two
windows
.
<EOS>
It
was
so
strangely
rough
and
misshapen
a
thing
to
exhibit
prominently
in
a
neat
roam
,
that
I
suspected
some
history
must
be
attached
to
it
,
and
resolved
to
speak
to
my
friend
the
nun
about
it
at
the
earliest
opportunity
.
  
<EOS>
"
Mother
Martha
,
"
said
I
,
taking
advantage
of
the
first
pause
in
the
succession
of
quaintly
innocent
questions
which
she
was
as
usual
addressing
to
me
,
"
I
have
been
looking
at
that
rough
old
cross
hanging
between
the
windows
,
and
fancying
that
it
must
surely
be
some
curiosity
"
  
"
Hush
!
hush
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
nun
,
"
you
must
not
speak
of
that
as
a
"
curiosity
'
;
the
Mother
Superior
calls
it
a
Relic
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
beg
your
pardon
,
"
said
I
;
"
I
ought
to
have
chosen
my
expressions
more
carefully
"
  
"
Not
,
"
interposed
Mother
Martha
,
nodding
to
show
me
that
my
apology
need
not
be
finished
 
<EOS>
"
not
that
it
is
exactly
a
relic
in
the
strict
Catholic
sense
of
the
word
;
but
there
were
circumstances
in
the
life
of
the
person
who
made
it
"
Here
she
stopped
,
and
looked
at
me
doubtfully
.
  
<EOS>
"
Circumstances
,
perhaps
,
which
it
is
not
considered
advisable
to
communicate
to
strangers
,
"
I
suggested
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
no
!
"
answered
the
nun
,
"
I
never
heard
that
they
were
to
be
kept
a
secret
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
told
as
a
secret
to
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
all
about
them
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
Certainly
.
<EOS>
I
could
tell
you
the
whole
history
of
the
wooden
cross
;
but
it
is
all
about
Catholics
,
and
you
are
a
Protestant
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
Mother
Martha
,
does
not
make
it
at
all
less
interesting
to
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Does
it
not
,
indeed
?
"
exclaimed
the
nun
,
innocently
.
<EOS>
"
What
a
strange
man
you
are
!
<EOS>
and
what
a
remarkable
religion
yours
must
be
!
<EOS>
What
do
your
priests
say
about
ours
?
<EOS>
Are
they
learned
men
,
your
priests
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
felt
that
my
chance
of
hearing
Mother
Martha
's
story
would
be
a
poor
one
indeed
,
if
I
allowed
her
to
begin
a
fresh
string
of
questions
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
dismissed
the
inquiries
about
the
clergy
of
the
Established
Church
with
the
most
irreverent
briefness
,
and
recalled
her
attention
forthwith
to
the
subject
of
the
wooden
cross
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
"
said
the
good
-
natured
nun
;
"
surely
you
shall
hear
all
I
can
tell
you
about
it
;
but
"
she
hesitated
timidly
,
"
but
I
must
ask
the
Mother
Superior
's
leave
first
.
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
these
words
,
she
summoned
the
portress
,
to
my
great
amusement
,
to
keep
guard
over
the
inestimable
Correggio
in
her
absence
,
and
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
five
minutes
she
came
back
,
looking
quite
happy
and
important
in
her
innocent
way
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Mother
Superior
,
"
she
said
,
"
has
given
me
leave
to
tell
all
I
know
about
the
wooden
cross
.
<EOS>
She
says
it
may
do
you
good
,
and
improve
your
Protestant
opinion
of
us
Catholics
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
expressed
myself
as
being
both
willing
and
anxious
to
profit
by
what
I
heard
;
and
the
nun
began
her
narrative
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
She
related
it
in
her
own
simple
,
earnest
,
minute
way
;
dwelling
as
long
on
small
particulars
as
on
important
incidents
;
and
making
moral
reflections
for
my
benefit
at
every
place
where
it
was
possible
to
introduce
them
.
<EOS>
In
spite
,
however
,
of
these
drawbacks
in
the
telling
of
it
,
the
story
interested
and
impressed
me
in
no
ordinary
degree
;
and
I
now
purpose
putting
the
events
of
it
together
as
skillfully
and
strikingly
as
I
can
,
in
the
hope
that
this
written
version
of
the
narrative
may
appeal
as
strongly
to
the
reader
's
sympathies
as
the
spoken
version
did
to
mine
.
  
<EOS>
THE
NUN
'S
STORY
  
OF
  
<EOS>
GABRIEL
'S
<EOS>
MARRIAGE
  
.
  
<EOS>
One
night
,
during
the
period
of
the
first
French
Revolution
,
the
family
of
Francois
Sarzeau
,
a
fisherman
of
Brittany
,
were
all
waking
and
watching
at
a
late
hour
in
their
cottage
on
the
peninsula
of
Quiberon
.
<EOS>
Francois
had
gone
out
in
his
boat
that
evening
,
 
as
usual
,
to
fish
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
his
departure
,
the
wind
had
risen
,
the
clouds
had
gathered
;
and
the
storm
,
which
had
been
threatening
at
intervals
throughout
the
whole
day
,
burst
forth
furiously
about
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
eleven
;
and
the
raging
of
the
wind
over
the
barren
,
heathy
peninsula
still
seemed
to
increase
with
each
fresh
blast
that
tore
its
way
out
upon
the
open
sea
;
the
crashing
of
the
waves
on
the
beach
was
awful
to
hear
;
the
dreary
blackness
of
the
sky
terrible
to
behold
.
<EOS>
The
longer
they
listened
to
the
storm
,
the
oftener
they
looked
out
at
it
,
the
fainter
grew
the
hopes
which
the
fisherman
's
family
still
strove
to
cherish
for
the
safety
of
Francois
Sarzeau
and
of
his
younger
son
who
had
gone
with
him
in
the
boat
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
impressive
in
the
simplicity
of
the
scene
that
was
now
passing
within
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
the
great
,
rugged
,
black
fire
-
place
crouched
two
little
girls
;
the
younger
half
asleep
,
with
her
head
in
her
sister
's
lap
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
daughters
of
the
fisherman
;
and
opposite
to
them
sat
their
eldest
brother
,
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
His
right
arm
had
been
badly
wounded
in
a
recent
encounter
at
the
national
game
of
the
Soule
,
a
sport
resembling
our
English
foot
-
ball
;
but
played
on
both
sides
in
such
savage
earnest
by
the
people
of
Brittany
as
to
end
always
in
bloodshed
,
often
in
mutilation
,
sometimes
even
in
loss
of
life
.
<EOS>
On
the
same
bench
with
Gabriel
sat
his
betrothed
wife
 
a
girl
of
eighteen
 
clothed
in
the
plain
,
almost
monastic
black
-
and
-
white
costume
of
her
native
district
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
daughter
of
a
small
farmer
living
at
some
little
distance
from
the
coast
.
<EOS>
Between
the
groups
formed
on
either
side
of
the
fire
-
place
,
the
vacant
space
was
occupied
by
the
foot
of
a
truckle
-
bed
.
<EOS>
In
this
bed
lay
a
very
old
man
,
the
father
of
Francois
Sarzeau
.
<EOS>
His
haggard
face
was
covered
with
deep
wrinkles
;
his
long
white
hair
flowed
over
the
coarse
lump
of
sacking
which
served
him
for
a
pillow
,
and
his
light
gray
eyes
wandered
incessantly
,
with
a
strange
expression
of
terror
and
suspicion
,
from
person
to
person
,
and
from
object
to
object
,
in
all
parts
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Whenever
the
wind
and
sea
whistled
and
roared
at
their
loudest
,
he
muttered
to
himself
and
tossed
his
hands
fretfully
on
his
wretched
coverlet
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
his
eyes
always
fixed
themselves
intently
on
a
little
delf
image
of
the
Virgin
placed
in
a
niche
over
the
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
Every
time
they
saw
him
look
in
this
direction
Gabriel
and
the
young
girls
shuddered
and
crossed
themselves
;
and
even
the
child
,
who
still
kept
awake
,
imitated
their
example
.
<EOS>
There
was
one
bond
of
feeling
at
least
between
the
old
man
and
his
grandchildren
,
which
connected
his
age
and
their
youth
unnaturally
and
closely
together
.
<EOS>
This
feeling
was
reverence
for
the
superstitions
which
had
been
handed
down
to
them
by
their
ancestors
from
centuries
and
centuries
back
,
as
far
even
as
the
age
of
the
Druids
.
<EOS>
The
spirit
warnings
of
disaster
and
death
which
the
old
man
heard
in
the
wailing
of
the
wind
,
in
the
crashing
of
the
waves
,
in
the
dreary
,
monotonous
rattling
of
the
casement
,
the
young
man
and
his
affianced
wife
and
the
little
child
who
cowered
by
the
fireside
heard
too
.
<EOS>
All
differences
in
sex
,
in
temperament
,
in
years
,
superstition
was
strong
enough
to
strike
down
to
its
own
dread
level
,
in
the
fisherman
's
cottage
,
on
that
stormy
night
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
the
benches
by
the
fireside
and
the
bed
,
the
only
piece
of
furniture
in
the
room
was
a
coarse
wooden
table
,
with
a
loaf
of
black
bread
,
a
knife
,
and
a
pitcher
of
cider
placed
on
it
.
<EOS>
Old
nets
,
coils
of
rope
,
tattered
sails
,
hung
,
about
the
walls
and
over
the
wooden
partition
which
separated
the
room
into
two
compartments
.
<EOS>
Wisps
of
straw
and
ears
of
barley
drooped
down
through
the
rotten
rafters
and
gaping
boards
that
made
the
floor
of
the
granary
above
.
  
<EOS>
These
different
objects
,
and
the
persons
in
the
cottage
,
who
composed
the
only
surviving
members
of
the
fisherman
's
family
,
were
strangely
and
wildly
lit
up
by
the
blaze
of
the
fire
and
by
the
still
brighter
glare
of
a
resin
torch
stuck
into
a
block
of
wood
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
<EOS>
The
red
and
yellow
light
played
full
on
the
weird
face
of
the
old
man
as
he
lay
opposite
to
it
,
and
glanced
fitfully
on
the
figures
of
the
young
girl
,
Gabriel
,
and
the
two
children
;
the
great
,
gloomy
shadows
rose
and
fell
,
and
grew
and
lessened
in
bulk
about
the
walls
like
visions
of
darkness
,
animated
by
a
supernatural
specter
-
life
,
while
the
dense
obscurity
outside
spreading
before
the
curtainless
window
seemed
as
a
wall
of
solid
darkness
that
had
closed
in
forever
around
the
fisherman
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
night
scene
within
the
cottage
was
almost
as
wild
and
as
dreary
to
look
upon
as
the
night
scene
without
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
the
different
persons
in
the
room
sat
together
without
speaking
,
even
without
looking
at
each
other
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
girl
turned
and
whispered
something
into
Gabriel
's
ear
:
  
<EOS>
"
Perrine
,
what
were
you
saying
to
Gabriel
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
child
opposite
,
seizing
the
first
opportunity
of
breaking
the
desolate
silence
 
doubly
desolate
at
her
age
 
which
was
preserved
by
all
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
telling
him
,
"
answered
Perrine
,
simply
,
"
that
it
was
time
to
change
the
bandages
on
his
arm
;
and
I
also
said
to
him
,
what
I
have
often
said
before
,
that
he
must
never
play
at
that
terrible
game
of
the
Soule
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
been
looking
intently
at
Perrine
and
his
grandchild
as
they
spoke
.
<EOS>
His
harsh
,
hollow
voice
mingled
with
the
last
soft
tones
of
the
young
girl
,
repeating
over
and
over
again
the
same
terrible
words
,
"
Drowned
!
<EOS>
drowned
!
<EOS>
Son
and
grandson
,
both
drowned
!
<EOS>
both
drowned
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
,
grandfather
,
"
said
Gabriel
,
"
we
must
not
lose
all
hope
for
them
yet
.
<EOS>
God
and
the
Blessed
Virgin
protect
them
!
"
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
little
delf
image
,
and
crossed
himself
;
the
others
imitated
him
,
except
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
He
still
tossed
his
hands
over
the
coverlet
,
and
still
repeated
,
"
Drowned
!
<EOS>
drowned
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
that
accursed
Soule
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
young
man
.
"
<EOS>
But
for
this
wound
I
should
have
been
with
my
father
.
<EOS>
The
poor
boy
's
life
might
at
least
have
been
saved
;
for
we
should
then
have
left
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Silence
!
"
exclaimed
the
harsh
voice
from
the
bed
.
<EOS>
"
The
wail
of
dying
men
rises
louder
than
the
loud
sea
;
the
devil
's
psalm
-
singing
roars
higher
than
the
roaring
wind
!
<EOS>
Be
silent
,
and
listen
!
<EOS>
Francois
drowned
!
<EOS>
Pierre
drowned
!
<EOS>
Hark
!
Hark
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
terrific
blast
of
wind
burst
over
the
house
as
he
spoke
,
shaking
it
to
its
center
,
overpowering
all
other
sounds
,
even
to
the
deafening
crash
of
the
waves
.
<EOS>
The
slumbering
child
awoke
,
and
uttered
a
scream
of
fear
.
<EOS>
Perrine
,
who
had
been
kneeling
before
her
lover
binding
the
fresh
bandages
on
his
wounded
arm
,
paused
in
her
occupation
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
looked
toward
the
window
;
his
experience
told
him
what
must
be
the
hurricane
fury
of
that
blast
of
wind
out
at
sea
,
and
he
sighed
bitterly
as
he
murmured
to
himself
,
<EOS>
"
God
help
them
both
 
man
's
help
will
be
as
nothing
to
them
now
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
!
"
cried
the
voice
from
the
bed
in
altered
tones
 
very
faint
and
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
hear
or
did
not
attend
to
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
trying
to
soothe
and
encourage
the
young
girl
at
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
love
,
"
he
said
,
kissing
her
very
gently
and
tenderly
on
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
as
safe
here
as
anywhere
.
<EOS>
Was
I
not
right
in
saying
that
it
would
be
madness
to
attempt
taking
you
back
to
the
farmhouse
this
evening
?
<EOS>
You
can
sleep
in
that
room
,
Perrine
,
when
you
are
tired
 
you
can
sleep
with
the
two
girls
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Gabriel
!
brother
Gabriel
!
"
cried
one
of
the
children
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
look
at
grandfather
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
ran
to
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
had
raised
himself
into
a
sitting
position
;
his
eyes
were
dilated
,
his
whole
face
was
rigid
with
terror
,
his
hands
were
stretched
out
convulsively
toward
his
grandson
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
White
Women
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
screamed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
White
Women
;
the
grave
-
diggers
of
the
drowned
are
out
on
the
sea
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
children
,
with
cries
of
terror
,
flung
themselves
into
Perrine
's
arms
;
even
Gabriel
uttered
an
exclamation
of
horror
,
and
started
back
from
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
Still
the
old
man
reiterated
,
"
The
White
Women
!
<EOS>
The
White
Women
!
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
look
-
out
westward
,
where
the
ebb
-
tide
has
left
the
sand
dry
.
<EOS>
You
'll
see
them
bright
as
lightning
in
the
darkness
,
mighty
as
the
angels
in
stature
,
sweeping
like
the
wind
over
the
sea
,
in
their
long
white
garments
,
with
their
white
hair
trailing
far
behind
them
!
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
You
'll
see
them
stop
and
hover
over
the
place
where
your
father
and
your
brother
have
been
drowned
;
you
'll
see
them
come
on
till
they
reach
the
sand
<EOS>
,
you
'll
see
them
dig
in
it
with
their
naked
feet
and
beckon
awfully
to
the
raging
sea
to
give
up
its
dead
.
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
Gabriel
 
or
,
though
it
should
be
the
death
of
me
,
I
will
get
up
and
open
it
myself
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
's
face
whitened
even
to
his
lips
,
but
he
made
a
sign
that
he
would
obey
.
<EOS>
It
required
the
exertion
of
his
whole
strength
to
keep
the
door
open
against
the
wind
while
he
looked
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
see
them
,
grandson
Gabriel
?
<EOS>
Speak
the
truth
,
and
tell
me
if
you
see
them
,
"
cried
the
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
see
nothing
but
darkness
 
pitch
darkness
,
"
answered
Gabriel
,
letting
the
door
close
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
woe
!
<EOS>
woe
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
his
grandfather
,
sinking
back
exhausted
on
the
pillow
.
"
<EOS>
Darkness
to
you
;
but
bright
as
lightning
to
the
eyes
that
are
allowed
to
see
them
.
<EOS>
Drowned
!
<EOS>
drowned
!
<EOS>
Pray
for
their
souls
,
Gabriel
 
<EOS>
I
see
the
White
Women
even
where
I
lie
,
and
dare
not
pray
for
them
.
<EOS>
Son
and
grandson
drowned
!
<EOS>
both
drowned
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
young
man
went
back
to
Perrine
and
the
children
.
  
<EOS>
"
Grandfather
is
very
ill
to
-
night
,
"
he
whispered
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
all
go
into
the
bedroom
,
and
leave
me
alone
to
watch
by
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
rose
as
he
spoke
,
crossed
themselves
before
the
image
of
the
Virgin
,
kissed
him
one
by
one
,
and
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
softly
entered
the
little
room
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
looked
at
his
grandfather
,
and
saw
that
he
lay
quiet
now
,
with
his
eyes
closed
as
if
he
were
already
dropping
asleep
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
then
heaped
some
fresh
logs
on
the
fire
,
and
sat
down
by
it
to
watch
till
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Very
dreary
was
the
moaning
of
the
night
storm
;
but
it
was
not
more
dreary
than
the
thoughts
which
now
occupied
him
in
his
solitude
 
thoughts
darkened
and
distorted
by
the
terrible
superstitions
of
his
country
and
his
race
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
period
of
his
mother
's
death
he
had
been
oppressed
by
the
conviction
that
some
curse
hung
over
the
family
.
<EOS>
At
first
they
had
been
prosperous
,
they
had
got
money
,
a
little
legacy
had
been
left
them
.
<EOS>
But
this
good
fortune
had
availed
only
for
a
time
;
disaster
on
disaster
strangely
and
suddenly
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Losses
,
misfortunes
,
poverty
,
want
itself
had
overwhelmed
them
;
his
father
's
temper
had
become
so
soured
,
that
the
oldest
friends
of
Francois
Sarzeau
declared
he
was
changed
beyond
recognition
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
all
this
past
misfortune
 
the
steady
,
withering
,
household
blight
of
many
years
 
had
ended
in
the
last
,
worst
misery
of
all
 
in
death
.
<EOS>
The
fate
of
his
father
and
his
brother
admitted
no
longer
of
a
doubt
;
he
knew
it
,
as
he
listened
to
the
storm
,
as
he
reflected
on
his
grandfather
's
words
,
as
he
called
to
mind
his
own
experience
of
the
perils
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
And
this
double
bereavement
had
fallen
on
him
just
as
the
time
was
approaching
for
his
marriage
with
Perrine
;
just
when
misfortune
was
most
ominous
of
evil
,
just
when
it
was
hardest
to
bear
!
<EOS>
Forebodings
,
which
he
dared
not
realize
,
began
now
to
mingle
with
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
,
whenever
his
thoughts
wandered
from
the
present
to
the
future
;
and
as
he
sat
by
the
lonely
fireside
,
murmuring
from
time
to
time
the
Church
prayer
for
the
repose
of
the
dead
,
he
almost
involuntarily
mingled
with
it
another
prayer
,
expressed
only
in
his
own
simple
words
,
for
the
safety
of
the
living
 
for
the
young
girl
whose
love
was
his
sole
earthly
treasure
;
for
the
motherless
children
who
must
now
look
for
protection
to
him
alone
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
sat
by
the
hearth
a
long
,
long
time
,
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
,
not
once
looking
round
toward
the
bed
,
when
he
was
startled
by
hearing
the
sound
of
his
grandfather
's
voice
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
"
whispered
the
old
man
,
trembling
and
shrinking
as
he
spoke
,
"
Gabriel
,
do
you
hear
a
dripping
of
water
 
now
slow
,
now
quick
again
 
on
the
floor
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
nothing
,
grandfather
,
but
the
crackling
of
the
fire
,
and
the
roaring
of
the
storm
outside
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Drip
,
drip
,
drip
!
<EOS>
Faster
and
faster
;
plainer
and
plainer
.
<EOS>
Take
the
torch
,
Gabriel
;
look
down
on
the
floor
 
look
with
all
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
Is
the
place
wet
there
?
<EOS>
Is
it
the
rain
from
heaven
that
is
dropping
through
the
roof
?
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
took
the
torch
with
trembling
fingers
and
knelt
down
on
the
floor
to
examine
it
closely
.
<EOS>
He
started
back
from
the
place
,
as
he
saw
that
it
was
quite
dry
 
<EOS>
the
torch
dropped
upon
the
hearth
 
he
fell
on
his
knees
before
the
statue
of
the
Virgin
and
hid
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
the
floor
wet
?
<EOS>
Answer
me
<EOS>
,
I
command
you
 
<EOS>
is
the
floor
wet
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
old
man
,
quickly
and
breathlessly
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
rose
,
went
back
to
the
bedside
,
and
whispered
to
him
that
no
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
inside
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
words
,
he
saw
a
change
pass
over
his
grandfather
's
face
 
<EOS>
the
sharp
features
seemed
to
wither
up
on
a
sudden
;
the
eager
expression
to
grow
vacant
and
death
-
like
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
The
voice
,
too
,
altered
;
it
was
harsh
and
querulous
no
more
;
its
tones
became
strangely
soft
,
slow
,
and
solemn
,
when
the
old
man
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hear
it
still
,
"
he
said
,
"
drip
!
<EOS>
drip
!
<EOS>
faster
and
plainer
than
ever
.
<EOS>
That
ghostly
dropping
of
water
is
the
last
and
the
surest
of
the
fatal
signs
which
have
told
of
your
father
's
and
your
brother
's
deaths
to
-
night
,
and
I
know
from
the
place
where
I
hear
it
 
<EOS>
the
foot
of
the
bed
<EOS>
I
lie
on
 
that
it
is
a
warning
to
me
of
my
own
approaching
end
.
<EOS>
I
am
called
where
my
son
and
my
grandson
have
gone
before
me
;
my
weary
time
in
this
world
is
over
at
last
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
Perrine
and
the
children
come
in
here
,
if
they
should
awake
 
<EOS>
they
are
too
young
to
look
at
death
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
's
blood
curdled
when
he
heard
these
words
 
when
he
touched
his
grandfather
's
hand
,
and
felt
the
chill
that
it
struck
to
his
own
 
when
he
listened
to
the
raging
wind
,
and
knew
that
all
help
was
miles
and
miles
away
from
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
Still
,
in
spite
of
the
storm
,
the
darkness
,
and
the
distance
,
he
thought
not
for
a
moment
of
neglecting
the
duty
that
had
been
taught
him
from
his
childhood
 
<EOS>
the
duty
of
summoning
the
priest
to
the
bedside
of
the
dying
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
call
Perrine
,
"
he
said
,
"
to
watch
by
you
while
I
am
away
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
"
cried
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stop
,
Gabriel
;
I
implore
,
I
command
you
not
to
leave
me
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
The
priest
,
grandfather
 
your
confession
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
must
be
made
to
you
.
<EOS>
In
this
darkness
and
this
hurricane
no
man
can
keep
the
path
across
the
heath
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
I
am
dying
 
I
should
be
dead
before
you
got
back
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
for
the
love
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
stop
here
with
me
till
I
die
 
<EOS>
my
time
is
short
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
terrible
secret
that
I
must
tell
to
somebody
before
I
draw
my
last
breath
!
<EOS>
Your
ear
to
my
mouth
 
quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
"
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
last
words
,
a
slight
noise
was
audible
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
,
the
door
half
opened
,
and
Perrine
appeared
at
it
,
looking
affrightedly
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
vigilant
eyes
of
the
old
man
 
suspicious
even
in
death
 
<EOS>
caught
sight
of
her
directly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
back
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
faintly
,
before
she
could
utter
a
word
;
"
go
back
 
push
her
back
,
Gabriel
,
and
nail
down
the
latch
in
the
door
,
if
she
wo
n't
shut
it
of
herself
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Dear
Perrine
!
<EOS>
go
in
again
,
"
implored
Gabriel
.
"
<EOS>
Go
in
,
and
keep
the
children
from
disturbing
us
.
<EOS>
You
will
only
make
him
worse
 
<EOS>
you
can
be
of
no
use
here
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
She
obeyed
without
speaking
,
and
shut
the
door
again
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
old
man
clutched
him
by
the
arm
,
and
repeated
,
"
Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
your
ear
close
to
my
mouth
,
"
Gabriel
heard
her
say
to
the
children
(
who
were
both
awake
)
<EOS>
,
"
Let
us
pray
for
grandfather
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
he
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
,
there
stole
on
his
ear
the
sweet
,
childish
tones
of
his
little
sisters
,
and
the
soft
,
subdued
voice
of
the
young
girl
who
was
teaching
them
the
prayer
,
mingling
divinely
with
the
solemn
wailing
of
wind
and
sea
,
rising
in
a
still
and
awful
purity
over
the
hoarse
,
gasping
whispers
of
the
dying
man
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
took
an
oath
not
to
tell
it
,
Gabriel
 
lean
down
closer
!
<EOS>
I
'm
weak
,
and
they
must
n't
hear
a
word
in
that
room
 
<EOS>
I
took
an
oath
not
to
tell
it
;
but
death
is
a
warrant
to
all
men
for
breaking
such
an
oath
as
that
.
<EOS>
Listen
;
do
n't
lose
a
word
I
'm
saying
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
away
into
the
room
:
the
stain
of
blood
-
guilt
has
defiled
it
forever
!
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
Let
me
speak
.
<EOS>
Now
your
father
's
dead
,
I
ca
n't
carry
the
horrid
secret
with
me
into
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Just
remember
,
Gabriel
 
try
if
you
ca
n't
remember
the
time
before
I
was
bedridden
,
ten
years
ago
and
more
 
<EOS>
it
was
about
six
weeks
,
you
know
,
before
your
mother
's
death
;
you
can
remember
it
by
that
.
<EOS>
You
and
all
the
children
were
in
that
room
with
your
mother
;
you
were
asleep
<EOS>
,
I
think
;
it
was
night
,
not
very
late
 
<EOS>
only
nine
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Your
father
and
I
were
standing
at
the
door
,
looking
out
at
the
heath
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
poor
at
that
time
,
he
had
been
obliged
to
sell
his
own
boat
,
and
none
of
the
neighbors
would
take
him
out
fishing
with
them
 
<EOS>
your
father
was
n't
liked
by
any
of
the
neighbors
.
<EOS>
Well
;
we
saw
a
stranger
coming
toward
us
;
a
very
young
man
,
with
a
knapsack
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
He
looked
like
a
gentleman
,
though
he
was
but
poorly
dressed
.
<EOS>
He
came
up
,
and
told
us
he
was
dead
tired
,
and
did
n't
think
he
could
reach
the
town
that
night
and
asked
if
we
would
give
him
shelter
till
morning
.
<EOS>
And
your
father
said
yes
,
if
he
would
make
no
noise
,
because
the
wife
was
ill
,
and
the
children
were
asleep
.
<EOS>
So
he
said
all
he
wanted
was
to
go
to
sleep
himself
before
the
fire
.
<EOS>
We
had
nothing
to
give
him
but
black
bread
.
<EOS>
He
had
better
food
with
him
than
that
,
and
undid
his
knapsack
to
get
at
it
,
and
 
and
 
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sinking
 
drink
!
<EOS>
something
to
drink
 
<EOS>
I
'm
parched
with
thirst
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Silent
and
deadly
pale
,
Gabriel
poured
some
of
the
cider
from
the
pitcher
on
the
table
into
a
drinking
-
cup
,
and
gave
it
to
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
Slight
as
the
stimulant
was
,
its
effect
on
him
was
almost
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
His
dull
eyes
brightened
a
little
,
and
he
went
on
in
the
same
whispering
tones
as
before
:
  
"
He
pulled
the
food
out
of
his
knapsack
rather
in
a
hurry
,
so
that
some
of
the
other
small
things
in
it
fell
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Among
these
was
a
pocketbook
,
which
your
father
picked
up
and
gave
him
back
;
and
he
put
it
in
his
coat
-
pocket
 
<EOS>
there
was
a
tear
in
one
of
the
sides
of
the
book
,
and
through
the
hole
some
bank
-
notes
bulged
out
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
,
and
so
did
your
father
<EOS>
(
do
n't
move
away
,
Gabriel
;
keep
close
,
there
's
nothing
in
me
to
shrink
from
)
.
<EOS>
Well
,
he
shared
his
food
,
like
an
honest
fellow
,
with
us
;
and
then
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
,
and
gave
me
four
or
five
livres
,
and
then
lay
down
before
the
fire
to
go
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
As
he
shut
his
eyes
,
your
father
looked
at
me
in
a
way
I
did
n't
like
.
<EOS>
He
'd
been
behaving
very
bitterly
and
desperately
toward
us
for
some
time
past
,
being
soured
about
poverty
,
and
your
mother
's
illness
,
and
the
constant
crying
out
of
you
children
for
more
to
eat
.
<EOS>
So
when
he
told
me
to
go
and
buy
some
wood
,
some
bread
,
and
some
wine
with
money
I
had
got
,
I
did
n't
like
,
somehow
,
to
leave
him
alone
with
the
stranger
;
and
so
made
excuses
,
saying
(
which
was
true
)
that
it
was
too
late
to
buy
things
in
the
village
that
night
.
<EOS>
But
he
told
me
in
a
rage
to
go
and
do
as
he
bid
me
,
and
knock
the
people
up
if
the
shop
was
shut
.
<EOS>
So
I
went
out
,
being
dreadfully
afraid
of
your
father
 
<EOS>
as
indeed
we
all
were
at
that
time
 
<EOS>
but
I
could
n't
make
up
my
mind
to
go
far
from
the
house
;
I
was
afraid
of
something
happening
,
though
I
did
n't
dare
to
think
what
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
it
was
,
but
I
stole
back
in
about
ten
minutes
on
tiptoe
to
the
cottage
;
I
looked
in
at
the
window
,
and
saw
 
O
God
!
<EOS>
forgive
him
!
<EOS>
O
God
!
forgive
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
saw
 
<EOS>
I
 
more
to
drink
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
speak
again
 
more
to
drink
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
voices
in
the
next
room
had
ceased
;
but
in
the
minute
of
silence
which
now
ensued
,
Gabriel
heard
his
sisters
kissing
Perrine
,
and
wishing
her
good
-
night
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
three
trying
to
go
asleep
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
pray
yourself
,
and
teach
your
children
after
you
to
pray
,
that
your
father
may
find
forgiveness
where
he
is
now
gone
.
<EOS>
I
saw
him
as
plainly
as
I
now
see
you
,
kneeling
with
his
knife
in
one
hand
over
the
sleeping
man
.
<EOS>
He
was
taking
the
little
book
with
the
notes
in
it
out
of
the
stranger
's
pocket
.
<EOS>
He
got
the
book
into
his
possession
,
and
held
it
quite
still
in
his
hand
for
an
instant
,
thinking
.
<EOS>
I
believe
 
<EOS>
oh
no
!
<EOS>
no
!
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
 
he
was
repenting
;
I
'm
sure
he
was
going
to
put
the
book
back
;
but
just
at
that
moment
the
stranger
moved
,
and
raised
one
of
his
arms
,
as
if
he
was
waking
up
.
<EOS>
Then
the
temptation
of
the
devil
grew
too
strong
for
your
father
 
<EOS>
I
saw
him
lift
the
hand
with
the
knife
in
it
 
but
saw
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
look
in
at
the
window
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
move
away
 
<EOS>
I
could
n't
cry
out
;
I
stood
with
my
back
turned
toward
the
house
,
shivering
all
over
,
though
it
was
a
warm
summer
-
time
,
and
hearing
no
cries
,
no
noises
at
all
,
from
the
room
behind
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
too
frightened
to
know
how
long
it
was
before
the
opening
of
the
cottage
door
<EOS>
made
me
turn
round
;
but
when
I
did
,
I
saw
your
father
standing
before
me
in
the
yellow
moonlight
,
carrying
in
his
arms
the
bleeding
body
of
the
poor
lad
who
had
shared
his
food
with
us
and
slept
on
our
hearth
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
groan
and
sob
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
Stifle
it
with
the
bedclothes
.
<EOS>
Hush
!
<EOS>
you
'll
wake
them
in
the
next
room
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
 
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
a
voice
from
behind
the
partition
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
let
me
come
out
and
be
with
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
!
no
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
collecting
the
last
remains
of
his
strength
in
the
attempt
to
speak
above
the
wind
,
which
was
just
then
howling
at
the
loudest
;
"
stay
where
you
are
 
do
n't
speak
,
do
n't
come
out
 
<EOS>
I
command
you
!
<EOS>
Gabriel
"
<EOS>
(
his
voice
dropped
to
a
faint
whisper
)
,
"
raise
me
up
in
bed
 
<EOS>
you
must
hear
the
whole
of
it
now
;
raise
me
;
I
'm
choking
so
that
I
can
hardly
speak
.
<EOS>
Keep
close
and
listen
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
much
more
.
<EOS>
Where
was
I
?
 
<EOS>
Ah
,
your
father
!
<EOS>
He
threatened
to
kill
me
if
I
did
n't
swear
to
keep
it
secret
;
and
in
terror
of
my
life
I
swore
.
<EOS>
He
made
me
help
him
to
carry
the
body
 
<EOS>
we
took
it
all
across
the
heath
 
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
horrible
,
horrible
,
under
the
bright
moon
(
lift
me
higher
,
Gabriel
)
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
great
stones
yonder
,
set
up
by
the
heathens
;
you
know
the
hollow
place
under
the
stones
they
call
"
The
Merchant
's
Table
'
;
we
had
plenty
of
room
to
lay
him
in
that
,
and
hide
him
so
;
and
then
we
ran
back
to
the
cottage
.
<EOS>
I
never
dared
to
go
near
the
place
afterward
;
no
,
nor
your
father
either
!
<EOS>
(
Higher
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
I
'm
choking
again
.
)
<EOS>
We
burned
the
pocket
-
book
and
the
knapsack
 
never
knew
his
name
 
<EOS>
we
kept
the
money
to
spend
.
<EOS>
(
You
're
not
lifting
me
;
you
're
not
listening
close
enough
!
)
<EOS>
Your
father
said
it
was
a
legacy
,
when
you
and
your
mother
asked
about
the
money
.
<EOS>
(
You
hurt
me
,
you
shake
me
to
pieces
,
Gabriel
,
when
you
sob
like
that
.
)
<EOS>
It
brought
a
curse
on
us
,
the
money
;
the
curse
has
drowned
your
father
and
your
brother
;
the
curse
is
killing
me
;
but
I
've
confessed
 
<EOS>
tell
the
priest
<EOS>
I
confessed
before
I
died
.
<EOS>
Stop
her
;
stop
Perrine
!
<EOS>
I
hear
her
getting
up
.
<EOS>
Take
his
bones
away
from
the
Merchant
's
Table
,
and
bury
them
for
the
love
of
God
!
<EOS>
and
tell
the
priest
(
lift
me
higher
,
lift
me
till
I
am
on
my
knees
)
 
if
your
father
was
alive
,
he
'd
murder
me
;
but
tell
the
priest
 
because
of
my
guilty
soul
 
to
pray
,
and
 
remember
the
Merchant
's
Table
 
to
bury
,
and
to
pray
 
to
pray
always
for
"
  
As
long
as
Perrine
heard
faintly
the
whispering
of
the
old
man
,
though
no
word
that
he
said
reached
her
ear
,
she
shrank
from
opening
the
door
in
the
partition
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
the
whispering
sounds
,
which
terrified
her
she
knew
not
how
or
why
,
first
faltered
,
then
ceased
altogether
;
when
she
heard
the
sobs
that
followed
them
;
and
when
her
heart
told
her
who
was
weeping
in
the
next
room
 
then
,
she
began
to
be
influenced
by
a
new
feeling
which
was
stronger
than
the
strongest
fear
,
and
she
opened
the
door
without
hesitation
,
almost
without
trembling
.
  
<EOS>
The
coverlet
was
drawn
up
over
the
old
man
;
Gabriel
was
kneeling
by
the
bedside
,
with
his
face
hidden
.
<EOS>
When
she
spoke
to
him
,
he
neither
answered
nor
looked
at
her
.
<EOS>
After
a
while
the
sobs
that
shook
him
ceased
;
but
still
he
never
moved
,
except
once
when
she
touched
him
,
and
then
he
shuddered
 
shuddered
under
her
hand
!
<EOS>
She
called
in
his
little
sisters
,
and
they
spoke
to
him
,
and
still
he
uttered
no
word
in
reply
.
<EOS>
They
wept
.
<EOS>
One
by
one
,
often
and
often
,
they
entreated
him
with
loving
words
;
but
the
stupor
of
grief
which
held
him
speechless
and
motionless
was
beyond
the
power
of
human
tears
,
stronger
even
than
the
strength
of
human
love
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
near
daybreak
,
and
the
storm
was
lulling
,
but
still
no
change
occurred
at
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
Once
or
twice
,
as
Perrine
knelt
near
Gabriel
,
still
vainly
endeavoring
to
arouse
him
to
a
sense
of
her
presence
,
she
thought
she
heard
the
old
man
breathing
feebly
,
and
stretched
out
her
hand
toward
the
coverlet
;
but
she
could
not
summon
courage
to
touch
him
or
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
been
present
at
a
death
-
bed
;
the
stillness
in
the
room
,
the
stupor
of
despair
that
had
seized
on
Gabriel
,
so
horrified
her
,
that
she
was
almost
as
helpless
as
the
two
children
by
her
side
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
till
the
dawn
looked
in
at
the
cottage
window
 
so
coldly
,
so
drearily
,
and
<EOS>
yet
so
re
-
assuringly
 
that
she
began
to
recover
her
self
-
possession
at
all
.
<EOS>
Then
she
knew
that
her
best
resource
would
be
to
summon
assistance
immediately
from
the
nearest
house
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
trying
to
persuade
the
two
children
to
remain
alone
in
the
cottage
with
Gabriel
during
her
temporary
absence
,
she
was
startled
by
the
sound
of
footsteps
outside
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
opened
,
and
a
man
appeared
on
the
threshold
,
standing
still
there
for
a
moment
in
the
dim
,
uncertain
light
.
  
<EOS>
She
looked
closer
 
looked
intently
at
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
Francois
Sarzeau
himself
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
fisherman
was
dripping
with
wet
;
but
his
face
,
always
pale
and
inflexible
,
seemed
to
be
but
little
altered
in
expression
by
the
perils
through
which
he
must
have
passed
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
Young
Pierre
lay
almost
insensible
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
In
the
astonishment
and
fright
of
the
first
moment
,
Perrine
screamed
as
she
recognized
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
,
there
,
there
!
"
he
said
,
peevishly
,
advancing
straight
to
the
hearth
with
his
burden
;
"
do
n't
make
a
noise
.
<EOS>
You
never
expected
to
see
us
alive
again
,
I
dare
say
.
<EOS>
We
gave
ourselves
up
as
lost
,
and
only
escaped
after
all
by
a
miracle
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
the
boy
down
where
he
could
get
the
full
warmth
of
the
fire
;
and
then
,
turning
round
,
took
a
wicker
-
covered
bottle
from
his
pocket
,
and
said
,
"
If
it
had
n't
been
for
the
brandy
"
He
stopped
suddenly
 
started
 
put
down
the
bottle
on
the
bench
near
him
 
and
advanced
quickly
to
the
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
Perrine
looked
after
him
as
he
went
;
and
saw
Gabriel
,
who
had
risen
when
the
door
was
opened
,
moving
back
from
the
bed
as
Francois
approached
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
's
face
seemed
to
have
been
suddenly
struck
to
stone
 
<EOS>
its
blank
,
ghastly
whiteness
was
awful
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
He
moved
slowly
backward
and
backward
till
he
came
to
the
cottage
wall
 
then
stood
quite
still
,
staring
on
his
father
with
wild
,
vacant
eyes
,
moving
his
hands
to
and
fro
before
him
,
muttering
,
but
never
pronouncing
one
audible
word
.
  
<EOS>
Francois
did
not
appear
to
notice
his
son
;
he
had
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
in
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Anything
the
matter
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
as
he
drew
it
down
.
  
<EOS>
Still
Gabriel
could
not
speak
.
<EOS>
Perrine
saw
it
,
and
answered
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
is
afraid
that
his
poor
grandfather
is
dead
,
"
she
whispered
,
nervously
.
  
<EOS>
"
Dead
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
There
was
no
sorrow
in
the
tone
as
he
echoed
the
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Was
he
very
bad
in
the
night
before
his
death
happened
?
<EOS>
Did
he
wander
in
his
mind
?
<EOS>
He
has
been
rather
light
-
headed
lately
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
was
very
restless
,
and
spoke
of
the
ghostly
warnings
that
we
all
know
of
;
he
said
he
saw
and
heard
many
things
which
told
him
from
the
other
world
that
you
and
Pierre
 
Gabriel
!
"
<EOS>
she
screamed
,
suddenly
interrupting
herself
,
"
look
at
him
!
<EOS>
Look
at
his
face
!
<EOS>
Your
grandfather
is
not
dead
!
"
  
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Francois
was
raising
his
father
's
head
to
look
closely
at
him
.
<EOS>
A
faint
spasm
had
indeed
passed
over
the
deathly
face
;
the
lips
quivered
,
the
jaw
dropped
.
<EOS>
Francois
shuddered
as
he
looked
,
and
moved
away
hastily
from
the
bed
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
instant
Gabriel
started
from
the
wall
;
his
expression
altered
,
his
pale
cheeks
flushed
suddenly
,
as
he
snatched
up
the
wicker
-
cased
bottle
,
and
poured
all
the
little
brandy
that
was
left
in
it
down
his
grandfather
's
throat
.
  
<EOS>
The
effect
was
nearly
instantaneous
;
the
sinking
vital
forces
rallied
desperately
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
's
eyes
opened
again
,
wandered
round
the
room
,
then
fixed
themselves
intently
on
Francois
as
he
stood
near
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Trying
and
terrible
as
his
position
was
at
that
moment
,
Gabriel
still
retained
self
-
possession
enough
to
whisper
a
few
words
in
Perrine
's
ear
.
"
<EOS>
Go
back
again
into
the
bedroom
,
and
take
the
children
with
you
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
may
have
something
to
speak
about
which
you
had
better
not
hear
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Son
Gabriel
,
your
grandfather
is
trembling
all
over
,
"
said
Francois
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
dying
at
all
,
he
is
dying
of
cold
;
help
me
to
lift
him
,
bed
and
all
,
to
the
hearth
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
do
n't
let
him
touch
me
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
let
him
look
at
me
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
come
near
me
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
Is
it
his
ghost
?
<EOS>
or
is
it
himself
?
"
  
<EOS>
As
Gabriel
answered
he
heard
a
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
father
opened
it
,
and
disclosed
to
view
some
people
from
the
neighboring
fishing
village
,
who
had
come
 
more
out
of
curiosity
than
sympathy
 
to
inquire
whether
Francois
and
the
boy
Pierre
had
survived
the
night
.
<EOS>
Without
asking
any
one
to
enter
,
the
fisherman
surlily
and
shortly
answered
the
various
questions
addressed
to
him
,
standing
in
his
own
doorway
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
Gabriel
heard
his
grandfather
muttering
vacantly
to
himself
,
"
Last
night
 
how
about
last
night
,
grandson
?
<EOS>
What
was
I
talking
about
last
night
?
<EOS>
Did
I
say
your
father
was
drowned
?
<EOS>
Very
foolish
to
say
he
was
drowned
,
and
then
see
him
come
back
alive
again
!
<EOS>
But
it
was
n't
that
 
<EOS>
I
'm
so
weak
in
my
head
,
I
ca
n't
remember
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
,
Gabriel
?
<EOS>
Something
too
horrible
to
speak
of
?
<EOS>
Is
that
what
you
're
whispering
and
trembling
about
?
<EOS>
I
said
nothing
horrible
.
<EOS>
A
crime
!
<EOS>
Bloodshed
!
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
of
any
crime
or
bloodshed
here
 
<EOS>
I
must
have
been
frightened
out
of
my
wits
to
talk
in
that
way
!
<EOS>
The
Merchant
's
Table
?
<EOS>
Only
a
big
heap
of
old
stones
!
<EOS>
What
with
the
storm
,
and
thinking
I
was
going
to
die
,
and
being
afraid
about
your
father
,
I
must
have
been
light
-
headed
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
give
another
thought
to
that
nonsense
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
I
'm
better
now
.
<EOS>
We
shall
all
live
to
laugh
at
poor
grandfather
for
talking
nonsense
about
crime
and
bloodshed
in
his
sleep
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
poor
old
man
 
last
night
 
light
-
headed
 
fancies
and
nonsense
of
an
old
man
 
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
laugh
at
it
?
<EOS>
I
'm
laughing
 
so
light
-
headed
,
so
light
"
  
He
stopped
suddenly
.
<EOS>
A
low
cry
,
partly
of
terror
and
partly
of
pain
,
escaped
him
;
the
look
of
pining
anxiety
and
imbecile
cunning
which
had
distorted
his
face
while
he
had
been
speaking
,
faded
from
it
forever
.
<EOS>
He
shivered
a
little
,
breathed
heavily
once
or
twice
,
then
became
quite
still
.
  
<EOS>
Had
he
died
with
a
falsehood
on
his
lips
?
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
looked
round
and
saw
that
the
cottage
door
was
closed
,
and
that
his
father
was
standing
against
it
.
<EOS>
How
long
he
had
occupied
that
position
,
how
many
of
the
old
man
's
last
words
he
had
heard
,
it
was
impossible
to
conjecture
,
but
there
was
a
lowering
suspicion
in
his
harsh
face
as
he
now
looked
away
from
the
corpse
to
his
son
,
which
made
Gabriel
shudder
;
and
the
first
question
that
he
asked
,
on
once
more
approaching
the
bedside
,
was
expressed
in
tones
which
,
quiet
as
they
were
,
had
a
fearful
meaning
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
did
your
grandfather
talk
about
last
night
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
did
not
answer
.
<EOS>
All
that
he
had
heard
,
all
that
he
had
seen
,
all
the
misery
and
horror
that
might
yet
be
to
come
,
had
stunned
his
mind
.
<EOS>
The
unspeakable
dangers
of
his
present
position
were
too
tremendous
to
be
realized
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
feel
them
vaguely
in
the
weary
torpor
that
oppressed
his
heart
;
while
in
every
other
direction
the
use
of
his
faculties
,
physical
and
mental
,
seemed
to
have
suddenly
and
totally
abandoned
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
your
tongue
wounded
,
son
Gabriel
,
as
well
as
your
arm
?
"
<EOS>
his
father
went
on
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
come
back
to
you
,
saved
by
a
miracle
;
and
you
never
speak
to
me
.
<EOS>
Would
you
rather
I
had
died
than
the
old
man
there
?
<EOS>
He
ca
n't
hear
you
now
 
<EOS>
why
should
n't
you
tell
me
what
nonsense
he
was
talking
last
night
?
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
?
<EOS>
I
say
you
shall
!
"
<EOS>
(
He
crossed
the
room
and
put
his
back
to
the
door
.
)
<EOS>
"
Before
either
of
us
leave
this
place
,
you
shall
confess
it
!
<EOS>
You
know
that
my
duty
to
the
Church
bids
me
to
go
at
once
and
tell
the
priest
of
your
grandfather
's
death
.
<EOS>
If
I
leave
that
duty
unfulfilled
,
remember
it
is
through
your
fault
!
<EOS>
You
keep
me
here
 
for
here
<EOS>
I
stop
till
I
'm
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
that
,
idiot
?
<EOS>
Speak
!
<EOS>
Speak
instantly
,
or
you
shall
repeat
it
to
the
day
of
your
death
!
<EOS>
I
ask
again
 
what
did
your
grandfather
say
to
you
when
he
was
wandering
in
his
mind
last
night
?
"
  
"
He
spoke
of
a
crime
committed
by
another
,
and
guiltily
kept
secret
by
him
,
"
answered
Gabriel
,
slowly
and
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
And
this
morning
he
denied
his
own
words
with
his
last
living
breath
.
<EOS>
But
last
night
,
if
he
spoke
the
truth
"
  
"
The
truth
!
"
echoed
Francois
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
truth
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
his
eyes
fell
,
then
turned
toward
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
minutes
he
stood
steadily
contemplating
it
;
breathing
quickly
,
and
drawing
his
hand
several
times
across
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
Then
he
faced
his
son
once
more
.
<EOS>
In
that
short
interval
he
had
become
in
outward
appearance
a
changed
man
;
expression
,
voice
,
and
manner
,
all
were
altered
.
  
<EOS>
"
Heaven
forgive
me
!
"
<EOS>
he
went
on
,
"
but
I
could
almost
laugh
at
myself
,
at
this
solemn
moment
,
for
having
spoken
and
acted
just
now
so
much
like
a
fool
!
<EOS>
Denied
his
words
,
did
he
?
<EOS>
Poor
old
man
!
<EOS>
they
say
sense
often
comes
back
to
light
-
headed
people
just
before
death
;
and
he
is
a
proof
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
Gabriel
,
my
own
wits
must
have
been
a
little
shaken
 
and
no
wonder
 
by
what
I
went
through
last
night
,
and
what
I
have
come
home
to
this
morning
.
<EOS>
As
if
you
,
or
anybody
,
could
ever
really
give
serious
credit
to
the
wandering
speeches
of
a
dying
old
man
!
<EOS>
(
Where
is
Perrine
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
send
her
away
?
)
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wonder
at
your
still
looking
a
little
startled
,
and
feeling
low
in
your
mind
,
and
all
that
 
for
you
've
had
a
trying
night
of
it
,
trying
in
every
way
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
a
good
deal
shaken
in
his
wits
last
night
,
between
fears
about
himself
and
fears
about
me
.
<EOS>
(
To
think
of
my
being
angry
with
you
,
Gabriel
,
for
being
a
little
alarmed
 
very
naturally
 
by
an
old
man
's
queer
fancies
!
)
Come
out
,
Perrine
 
come
out
of
the
bedroom
whenever
you
are
tired
of
it
<EOS>
:
you
must
learn
sooner
or
later
to
look
at
death
calmly
.
<EOS>
Shake
hands
,
Gabriel
;
and
let
us
make
it
up
,
and
say
no
more
about
what
has
passed
.
<EOS>
You
wo
n't
?
<EOS>
Still
angry
with
me
for
what
I
said
to
you
just
now
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
'll
think
better
about
it
by
the
time
I
return
.
<EOS>
Come
out
,
Perrine
;
we
've
no
secrets
here
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
are
you
going
to
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Gabriel
,
as
he
saw
his
father
hastily
open
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
tell
the
priest
that
one
of
his
congregation
is
dead
,
and
to
have
the
death
registered
,
"
answered
Francois
.
<EOS>
"
These
are
my
duties
,
and
must
be
performed
before
I
take
any
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
out
hurriedly
as
he
said
these
words
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
almost
trembled
at
himself
when
he
found
that
he
breathed
more
freely
,
that
he
felt
less
horribly
oppressed
both
in
mind
and
body
,
the
moment
his
father
's
back
was
turned
.
<EOS>
Fearful
as
thought
was
now
,
it
was
still
a
change
for
the
better
to
be
capable
of
thinking
at
all
.
<EOS>
Was
the
behavior
of
his
father
compatible
with
innocence
?
<EOS>
Could
the
old
man
's
confused
denial
of
his
own
words
in
the
morning
,
and
in
the
presence
of
his
son
,
be
set
for
one
instant
against
the
circumstantial
confession
that
he
had
made
during
the
night
alone
with
his
grandson
?
<EOS>
These
were
the
terrible
questions
which
Gabriel
now
asked
himself
,
and
which
he
shrank
involuntarily
from
answering
.
<EOS>
And
yet
that
doubt
,
the
solution
of
which
would
,
one
way
or
the
other
,
irrevocably
affect
the
whole
future
of
his
life
,
must
sooner
or
later
be
solved
at
any
hazard
!
  
<EOS>
Was
there
any
way
of
setting
it
at
rest
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
one
way
 
to
go
instantly
,
while
his
father
was
absent
,
and
examine
the
hollow
place
under
the
Merchant
's
Table
.
<EOS>
If
his
grandfather
's
confession
had
really
been
made
while
he
was
in
possession
of
his
senses
,
this
place
(
which
Gabriel
knew
to
be
covered
in
from
wind
and
weather
)
had
never
been
visited
since
the
commission
of
the
crime
by
the
perpetrator
,
or
by
his
unwilling
accomplice
;
though
time
had
destroyed
all
besides
,
the
hair
and
the
bones
of
the
victim
would
still
be
left
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
 
if
truth
had
indeed
been
spoken
.
<EOS>
As
this
conviction
grew
on
him
,
the
young
man
's
cheek
paled
;
and
he
stopped
irresolute
half
-
way
between
the
hearth
and
the
door
.
<EOS>
Then
he
looked
down
doubtfully
at
the
corpse
on
the
bed
;
and
then
there
came
upon
him
suddenly
a
revulsion
of
feeling
.
<EOS>
A
wild
,
feverish
impatience
to
know
the
worst
without
another
instant
of
delay
possessed
him
.
<EOS>
Only
telling
Perrine
that
he
should
be
back
soon
,
and
that
she
must
watch
by
the
dead
in
his
absence
,
he
left
the
cottage
at
once
,
without
waiting
to
hear
her
reply
,
even
without
looking
back
as
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
tracks
to
the
Merchant
's
Table
.
<EOS>
One
,
the
longer
of
the
two
,
by
the
coast
cliffs
;
the
other
across
the
heath
.
<EOS>
But
this
latter
path
was
also
,
for
some
little
distance
,
the
path
which
led
to
the
village
and
the
church
.
<EOS>
He
was
afraid
of
attracting
his
father
's
attention
here
,
so
he
took
the
direction
of
the
coast
.
<EOS>
At
one
spot
the
track
trended
inland
,
winding
round
some
of
the
many
Druid
monuments
scattered
over
the
country
.
<EOS>
This
place
was
on
high
ground
,
and
commanded
a
view
,
at
no
great
distance
,
of
the
path
leading
to
the
village
,
just
where
it
branched
off
from
the
heathy
ridge
which
ran
in
the
direction
of
the
Merchant
's
Table
.
<EOS>
Here
Gabriel
descried
the
figure
of
a
man
standing
with
his
back
toward
the
coast
.
  
<EOS>
This
figure
was
too
far
off
to
be
identified
with
absolute
certainty
,
but
it
looked
like
,
and
might
well
be
,
Francois
Sarzeau
.
<EOS>
Whoever
he
was
,
the
man
was
evidently
uncertain
which
way
he
should
proceed
.
<EOS>
When
he
moved
forward
,
it
was
first
to
advance
several
paces
toward
the
Merchant
's
Table
;
then
he
went
back
again
toward
the
distant
cottages
and
the
church
.
<EOS>
Twice
he
hesitated
thus
;
the
second
time
pausing
long
before
he
appeared
finally
to
take
the
way
that
led
to
the
village
.
  
<EOS>
Leaving
the
post
of
observation
among
the
stones
,
at
which
he
had
instinctively
halted
for
some
minutes
past
,
Gabriel
now
proceeded
on
his
own
path
.
<EOS>
Could
this
man
really
be
his
father
?
<EOS>
And
if
it
were
so
,
why
did
Francois
Sarzeau
only
determine
to
go
to
the
village
where
his
business
lay
,
after
having
twice
vainly
attempted
to
persevere
in
taking
the
exactly
opposite
direction
of
the
Merchant
's
Table
?
<EOS>
Did
he
really
desire
to
go
there
?
<EOS>
Had
he
heard
the
name
mentioned
,
when
the
old
man
referred
to
it
in
his
dying
words
?
<EOS>
And
had
he
failed
to
summon
courage
enough
to
make
all
safe
by
removing
 
<EOS>
This
last
question
was
too
horrible
to
be
pursued
;
Gabriel
stifled
it
affrightedly
in
his
own
heart
as
he
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
He
reached
the
great
Druid
monument
without
meeting
a
living
soul
on
his
way
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
rising
,
and
the
mighty
storm
-
clouds
of
the
night
were
parting
asunder
wildly
over
the
whole
eastward
horizon
.
<EOS>
The
waves
still
leaped
and
foamed
gloriously
:
but
the
gale
had
sunk
to
a
keen
,
fresh
breeze
.
<EOS>
As
Gabriel
looked
up
,
and
saw
how
brightly
the
promise
of
a
lovely
day
was
written
in
the
heavens
,
he
trembled
as
he
thought
of
the
search
which
he
was
now
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
The
sight
of
the
fair
,
fresh
sunrise
jarred
horribly
with
the
suspicions
of
committed
murder
that
were
rankling
foully
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
But
he
knew
that
his
errand
must
be
performed
,
and
he
nerved
himself
to
go
through
with
it
;
for
he
dared
not
return
to
the
cottage
until
the
mystery
had
been
cleared
up
at
once
and
forever
.
  
<EOS>
The
Merchant
's
Table
was
formed
by
two
huge
stones
resting
horizontally
on
three
others
.
<EOS>
In
the
troubled
times
of
more
than
half
a
century
ago
,
regular
tourists
were
unknown
among
the
Druid
monuments
of
Brittany
;
and
the
entrance
to
the
hollow
place
under
the
stones
 
since
often
visited
by
strangers
 
was
at
this
time
nearly
choked
up
by
brambles
and
weeds
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
's
first
look
at
this
tangled
nook
of
briers
convinced
him
that
the
place
had
not
been
entered
perhaps
for
years
,
by
any
living
being
.
<EOS>
Without
allowing
himself
to
hesitate
(
for
he
felt
that
the
slightest
delay
might
be
fatal
to
his
resolution
)
,
he
passed
as
gently
as
possible
through
the
brambles
,
and
knelt
down
at
the
low
,
dusky
,
irregular
entrance
of
the
hollow
place
under
the
stones
.
  
<EOS>
His
heart
throbbed
violently
,
his
breath
almost
failed
him
;
but
he
forced
himself
to
crawl
a
few
feet
into
the
cavity
,
and
then
groped
with
his
hand
on
the
ground
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
touched
something
!
<EOS>
Something
which
it
made
his
flesh
creep
to
handle
;
something
which
he
would
fain
have
dropped
,
but
which
he
grasped
tight
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
drew
back
into
the
outer
air
and
sunshine
.
<EOS>
Was
it
a
human
bone
?
<EOS>
No
!
<EOS>
he
had
been
the
dupe
of
his
own
morbid
terror
 
<EOS>
he
had
only
taken
up
a
fragment
of
dried
wood
!
  
<EOS>
Feeling
shame
at
such
self
-
deception
as
this
<EOS>
,
he
was
about
to
throw
the
wood
from
him
before
he
re
-
entered
the
place
,
when
another
idea
occurred
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Though
it
was
dimly
lighted
through
one
or
two
chinks
in
the
stones
,
the
far
part
of
the
interior
of
the
cavity
was
still
too
dusky
to
admit
of
perfect
examination
by
the
eye
,
even
on
a
bright
sunshiny
morning
.
<EOS>
Observing
this
,
he
took
out
the
tinder
-
box
and
matches
,
which
,
like
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
district
,
he
always
carried
about
with
him
for
the
purpose
of
lighting
his
pipe
,
determining
to
use
the
piece
of
wood
as
a
torch
which
might
illuminate
the
darkest
corner
of
the
place
when
he
next
entered
it
.
<EOS>
Fortunately
the
wood
had
remained
so
long
and
had
been
preserved
so
dry
in
its
sheltered
position
,
that
it
caught
fire
almost
as
easily
as
a
piece
of
paper
.
<EOS>
The
moment
it
was
fairly
aflame
<EOS>
Gabriel
went
into
the
cavity
,
penetrating
at
once
 
this
time
 
to
its
furthest
extremity
.
  
<EOS>
He
remained
among
the
stones
long
enough
for
the
wood
to
burn
down
nearly
to
his
hand
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
out
,
and
flung
the
burning
fragment
from
him
,
his
face
was
flushed
deeply
,
his
eyes
sparkled
.
<EOS>
He
leaped
carelessly
on
to
the
heath
,
over
the
bushes
through
which
he
had
threaded
his
way
so
warily
<EOS>
but
a
few
minutes
before
,
exclaiming
,
"
I
may
marry
Perrine
with
a
clear
conscience
now
;
I
am
the
son
of
as
honest
a
man
as
there
is
in
Brittany
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
had
closely
examined
the
cavity
in
every
corner
,
and
not
the
slightest
sign
that
any
dead
body
had
ever
been
laid
<EOS>
there
was
visible
in
the
hollow
place
under
the
Merchant
's
Table
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
marry
Perrine
with
a
clear
conscience
now
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
are
some
parts
of
the
world
where
it
would
be
drawing
no
natural
picture
of
human
nature
to
represent
a
son
as
believing
conscientiously
that
an
offense
against
life
and
the
laws
of
hospitality
,
secretly
committed
by
his
father
,
rendered
him
,
though
innocent
of
all
participation
in
it
,
unworthy
to
fulfill
his
engagement
with
his
affianced
wife
.
<EOS>
Among
the
simple
inhabitants
of
Gabriel
's
province
,
however
,
such
acuteness
of
conscientious
sensibility
as
this
was
no
extraordinary
exception
to
all
general
rules
.
<EOS>
Ignorant
and
superstitious
as
they
might
be
,
the
people
of
Brittany
practiced
the
duties
of
hospitality
as
devoutly
as
they
practiced
the
duties
of
the
national
religion
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
the
stranger
-
guest
,
rich
or
poor
,
was
a
sacred
presence
at
their
hearths
.
<EOS>
His
safety
was
their
especial
charge
,
his
property
their
especial
responsibility
.
<EOS>
They
might
be
half
starved
,
but
they
were
ready
to
share
the
last
crust
with
him
,
nevertheless
,
as
they
would
share
it
with
their
own
children
.
  
<EOS>
Any
outrage
on
the
virtue
of
hospitality
,
thus
born
and
bred
in
the
people
,
was
viewed
by
them
with
universal
disgust
,
and
punished
with
universal
execration
.
<EOS>
This
ignominy
was
uppermost
in
Gabriel
's
thoughts
by
the
side
of
his
grandfather
's
bed
;
the
dread
of
this
worst
dishonor
,
which
there
was
no
wiping
out
,
held
him
speechless
before
Perrine
,
shamed
and
horrified
him
so
that
he
felt
unworthy
to
look
her
in
the
face
;
and
when
the
result
of
his
search
at
the
Merchant
's
Table
proved
the
absence
there
of
all
evidence
of
the
crime
spoken
of
by
the
old
man
,
the
blessed
relief
,
the
absorbing
triumph
of
that
discovery
,
was
expressed
entirely
in
the
one
thought
which
had
prompted
his
first
joyful
words
:
<EOS>
He
could
marry
Perrine
with
a
clear
conscience
,
for
he
was
the
son
of
an
honest
man
!
  
<EOS>
When
he
returned
to
the
cottage
,
Francois
had
not
come
back
.
<EOS>
Perrine
was
astonished
at
the
change
in
Gabriel
's
manner
;
even
Pierre
and
the
children
remarked
it
.
<EOS>
Rest
and
warmth
had
by
this
time
so
far
recovered
the
younger
brother
,
that
he
was
able
to
give
some
account
of
the
perilous
adventures
of
the
night
at
sea
.
<EOS>
They
were
still
listening
to
the
boy
's
narrative
when
Francois
at
last
returned
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
Gabriel
who
held
out
his
hand
,
and
made
the
first
advances
toward
reconciliation
.
  
<EOS>
To
his
utter
amazement
,
his
father
recoiled
from
him
.
<EOS>
The
variable
temper
of
Francois
had
evidently
changed
completely
during
his
absence
at
the
village
.
<EOS>
A
settled
scowl
of
distrust
darkened
his
face
as
he
looked
at
his
son
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
shake
hands
with
people
who
have
once
doubted
me
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
loudly
and
irritably
;
"
for
I
always
doubt
them
forever
after
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
bad
son
!
<EOS>
You
have
suspected
your
father
of
some
infamy
that
you
dare
not
openly
charge
him
with
,
on
no
other
testimony
than
the
rambling
nonsense
of
a
half
-
witted
,
dying
old
man
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
to
me
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
hear
you
!
<EOS>
An
innocent
man
and
a
spy
are
bad
company
.
<EOS>
Go
and
denounce
me
,
you
Judas
in
disguise
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
care
for
your
secret
or
for
you
.
<EOS>
What
's
that
girl
<EOS>
Perrine
doing
here
still
?
<EOS>
Why
has
n't
she
gone
home
long
ago
?
<EOS>
The
priest
's
coming
;
we
do
n't
want
strangers
in
the
house
of
death
.
<EOS>
Take
her
back
to
the
farmhouse
,
and
stop
there
with
her
,
if
you
like
;
nobody
wants
you
here
!
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
something
in
the
manner
and
look
of
the
speaker
as
he
uttered
these
words
,
so
strange
,
so
sinister
,
so
indescribably
suggestive
of
his
meaning
much
more
than
he
said
,
that
Gabriel
felt
his
heart
sink
within
him
instantly
;
and
almost
at
the
same
moment
this
fearful
question
forced
itself
irresistibly
on
his
mind
:
might
not
his
father
have
followed
him
to
the
Merchant
's
Table
?
  
<EOS>
Even
if
he
had
been
desired
to
speak
,
he
could
not
have
spoken
now
,
while
that
question
and
the
suspicion
that
it
brought
with
it
were
utterly
destroying
all
the
re
-
assuring
hopes
and
convictions
of
the
morning
.
<EOS>
The
mental
suffering
produced
by
the
sudden
change
from
pleasure
to
pain
in
all
his
thoughts
,
reacted
on
him
physically
.
<EOS>
He
felt
as
if
he
were
stifling
in
the
air
of
the
cottage
,
in
the
presence
of
his
father
;
and
when
Perrine
hurried
on
her
walking
attire
,
and
with
a
face
which
alternately
flushed
and
turned
pale
with
every
moment
,
approached
the
door
,
he
went
out
with
her
as
hastily
as
if
he
had
been
flying
from
his
home
.
<EOS>
Never
had
the
fresh
air
and
the
free
daylight
felt
like
heavenly
and
guardian
influences
to
him
until
now
!
  
<EOS>
He
could
comfort
Perrine
under
his
father
's
harshness
,
he
could
assure
her
of
his
own
affection
,
which
no
earthly
influence
could
change
,
while
they
walked
together
toward
the
farmhouse
;
but
he
could
do
no
more
.
<EOS>
He
durst
not
confide
to
her
the
subject
that
was
uppermost
in
his
mind
;
of
all
human
beings
she
was
the
last
to
whom
he
could
reveal
the
terrible
secret
that
was
festering
at
his
heart
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
got
within
sight
of
the
farmhouse
,
Gabriel
stopped
;
and
,
promising
to
see
her
again
soon
,
took
leave
of
Perrine
with
assumed
ease
in
his
manner
and
with
real
despair
in
his
heart
.
<EOS>
Whatever
the
poor
girl
might
think
of
it
,
he
felt
,
at
that
moment
,
that
he
had
not
courage
to
face
her
father
,
and
hear
him
talk
happily
and
pleasantly
,
as
his
custom
was
,
of
Perrine
's
approaching
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
,
Gabriel
wandered
hither
and
thither
over
the
open
heath
,
neither
knowing
nor
caring
in
what
direction
<EOS>
he
turned
his
steps
.
<EOS>
The
doubts
about
his
father
's
innocence
which
had
been
dissipated
by
his
visit
to
the
Merchant
's
Table
,
that
father
's
own
language
and
manner
had
now
revived
 
had
even
confirmed
,
though
he
dared
not
yet
acknowledge
so
much
to
himself
.
<EOS>
It
was
terrible
enough
to
be
obliged
to
admit
that
the
result
of
his
morning
's
search
was
,
after
all
,
not
conclusive
 
that
the
mystery
was
,
in
very
truth
,
not
yet
cleared
up
.
<EOS>
The
violence
of
his
father
's
last
words
of
distrust
;
the
extraordinary
and
indescribable
changes
in
his
father
's
manner
while
uttering
them
 
what
did
these
things
mean
?
<EOS>
Guilt
or
innocence
?
<EOS>
Again
,
was
it
any
longer
reasonable
to
doubt
the
death
-
bed
confession
made
by
his
grandfather
?
<EOS>
Was
it
not
,
on
the
contrary
,
far
more
probable
that
the
old
man
's
denial
in
the
morning
of
his
own
words
at
night
had
been
made
under
the
influence
of
a
panic
terror
,
when
his
moral
consciousness
was
bewildered
,
and
his
intellectual
faculties
were
sinking
?
<EOS>
The
longer
Gabriel
thought
of
these
questions
,
the
less
competent
 
possibly
also
the
less
willing
 
<EOS>
he
felt
to
answer
them
.
<EOS>
Should
he
seek
advice
from
others
wiser
than
he
?
<EOS>
No
;
not
while
the
thousandth
part
of
a
chance
remained
that
his
father
was
innocent
.
  
<EOS>
This
thought
was
still
in
his
mind
,
when
he
found
himself
once
more
in
sight
of
his
home
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
hesitating
near
the
door
,
when
he
saw
it
opened
cautiously
.
<EOS>
His
brother
Pierre
looked
out
,
and
then
came
running
toward
him
.
<EOS>
"
Come
in
,
Gabriel
;
oh
,
do
come
in
!
"
<EOS>
said
the
boy
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
afraid
to
be
alone
with
father
.
<EOS>
He
's
been
beating
us
for
talking
of
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
went
in
.
<EOS>
His
father
looked
up
from
the
hearth
where
he
was
sitting
,
muttered
the
word
"
Spy
!
"
and
made
a
gesture
of
contempt
but
did
not
address
a
word
directly
to
his
son
.
<EOS>
The
hours
passed
on
in
silence
;
afternoon
waned
into
evening
,
and
evening
into
night
;
and
still
he
never
spoke
to
any
of
his
children
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
it
was
dark
,
he
went
out
,
and
took
his
net
with
him
,
saying
that
it
was
better
to
be
alone
on
the
sea
than
in
the
house
with
a
spy
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
returned
the
next
morning
there
was
no
change
in
him
.
<EOS>
Days
passed
 
weeks
,
months
,
even
elapsed
,
and
still
,
though
his
manner
insensibly
became
what
it
used
to
be
toward
his
other
children
,
it
never
altered
toward
his
eldest
son
At
the
rare
periods
when
they
now
met
,
except
when
absolutely
obliged
to
speak
,
he
preserved
total
silence
in
his
intercourse
with
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
He
would
never
take
Gabriel
out
with
him
in
the
boat
;
he
would
never
sit
alone
with
Gabriel
in
the
house
;
he
would
never
eat
a
meal
with
Gabriel
;
he
would
never
let
the
other
children
talk
to
him
about
Gabriel
;
and
he
would
never
hear
a
word
in
expostulation
,
a
word
in
reference
to
anything
his
dead
father
had
said
or
done
on
the
night
of
the
storm
,
from
Gabriel
himself
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
man
pined
and
changed
,
so
that
even
Perrine
hardly
knew
him
again
,
under
this
cruel
system
of
domestic
excommunication
;
under
the
wearing
influence
of
the
one
unchanging
doubt
which
never
left
him
;
and
,
more
than
all
,
under
the
incessant
reproaches
of
his
own
conscience
,
aroused
by
the
sense
that
he
was
evading
a
responsibility
which
it
was
his
solemn
,
his
immediate
duty
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
But
no
sting
of
conscience
,
no
ill
treatment
at
home
,
and
no
self
-
reproaches
for
failing
in
his
duty
of
confession
as
a
good
Catholic
,
were
powerful
enough
in
their
influence
over
Gabriel
to
make
him
disclose
the
secret
,
under
the
oppression
of
which
his
very
life
was
wasting
away
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
if
he
once
revealed
it
,
whether
his
father
was
ultimately
proved
to
be
guilty
or
innocent
,
there
would
remain
a
slur
and
a
suspicion
on
the
family
,
and
on
Perrine
besides
,
from
her
approaching
connection
with
it
,
which
in
their
time
and
in
their
generation
could
never
be
removed
.
<EOS>
The
reproach
of
the
world
is
terrible
even
in
the
crowded
city
,
where
many
of
the
dwellers
in
our
abiding
-
place
are
strangers
to
us
 
<EOS>
but
it
is
far
more
terrible
in
the
country
,
where
none
near
us
are
strangers
,
where
all
talk
of
us
and
know
of
us
,
where
nothing
intervenes
between
us
and
the
tyranny
of
the
evil
tongue
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
had
not
courage
to
face
this
,
and
dare
the
fearful
chance
of
life
-
long
ignominy
 
no
,
not
even
to
serve
the
sacred
interests
of
justice
,
of
atonement
,
and
of
truth
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
While
Gabriel
still
remained
prostrated
under
the
affliction
that
was
wasting
his
energies
of
body
and
mind
,
Brittany
was
visited
by
a
great
public
calamity
,
in
which
all
private
misfortunes
were
overwhelmed
for
a
while
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
time
when
the
ever
-
gathering
storm
of
the
French
Revolution
had
risen
to
its
hurricane
climax
.
<EOS>
Those
chiefs
of
the
new
republic
were
in
power
<EOS>
whose
last
,
worst
madness
it
was
to
decree
the
extinction
of
religion
and
the
overthrow
of
everything
that
outwardly
symbolized
it
throughout
the
whole
of
the
country
that
they
governed
.
<EOS>
Already
this
decree
had
been
executed
to
the
letter
in
and
around
Paris
;
and
now
the
soldiers
of
the
Republic
were
on
their
way
to
Brittany
,
headed
by
commanders
whose
commission
was
to
root
out
the
Christian
religion
in
the
last
and
the
surest
of
the
strongholds
still
left
to
it
in
France
.
  
<EOS>
These
men
began
their
work
in
a
spirit
worthy
of
the
worst
of
their
superiors
who
had
sent
them
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
They
gutted
churches
,
they
demolished
chapels
,
they
overthrew
road
-
side
crosses
wherever
they
found
them
.
<EOS>
The
terrible
guillotine
devoured
human
lives
in
the
villages
of
Brittany
as
it
had
devoured
them
in
the
streets
of
Paris
;
the
musket
and
the
sword
,
in
highway
and
byway
,
wreaked
havoc
on
the
people
 
even
on
women
and
children
kneeling
in
the
act
of
prayer
;
the
priests
were
tracked
night
and
day
from
one
hiding
-
place
,
where
they
still
offered
up
worship
,
to
another
,
and
were
killed
as
soon
as
overtaken
 
every
atrocity
was
committed
in
every
district
;
but
the
Christian
religion
still
spread
wider
than
the
widest
bloodshed
;
still
sprang
up
with
ever
-
renewed
vitality
from
under
the
very
feet
of
the
men
whose
vain
fury
was
powerless
to
trample
it
down
.
<EOS>
Everywhere
the
people
remained
true
to
their
Faith
;
everywhere
the
priests
stood
firm
by
them
in
their
sorest
need
.
<EOS>
The
executioners
of
the
Republic
had
been
sent
to
make
Brittany
a
country
of
apostates
;
they
did
their
worst
,
and
left
it
a
country
of
martyrs
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
,
while
this
frightful
persecution
was
still
raging
,
Gabriel
happened
to
be
detained
unusually
late
at
the
cottage
of
Perrine
's
father
.
<EOS>
He
had
lately
spent
much
of
his
time
at
the
farm
house
;
it
was
his
only
refuge
now
from
that
place
of
suffering
,
of
silence
,
and
of
secret
shame
,
which
he
had
once
called
home
!
<EOS>
Just
as
he
had
taken
leave
of
Perrine
for
the
night
,
and
was
about
to
open
the
farmhouse
door
,
her
father
stopped
him
,
and
pointed
to
a
chair
in
the
chimney
-
corner
.
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
us
alone
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
old
man
to
his
daughter
;
"
I
want
to
speak
to
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
You
can
go
to
your
mother
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
words
which
Pere
Bonan
 
as
he
was
called
by
the
neighbors
 
had
now
to
say
in
private
were
destined
to
lead
to
very
unexpected
events
.
<EOS>
After
referring
to
the
alteration
which
had
appeared
of
late
in
Gabriel
's
manner
,
the
old
man
began
by
asking
him
,
sorrowfully
but
not
suspiciously
,
whether
he
still
preserved
his
old
affection
for
Perrine
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
an
eager
answer
in
the
affirmative
,
Pere
Bonan
then
referred
to
the
persecution
still
raging
through
the
country
,
and
to
the
consequent
possibility
that
he
,
like
others
of
his
countrymen
,
might
yet
be
called
to
suffer
,
and
perhaps
to
die
,
for
the
cause
of
his
religion
.
<EOS>
If
this
last
act
of
self
-
sacrifice
were
required
of
him
,
Perrine
would
be
left
unprotected
,
unless
her
affianced
husband
performed
his
promise
to
her
,
and
assumed
,
without
delay
,
the
position
of
her
lawful
guardian
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
know
that
you
will
do
this
,
"
concluded
the
old
man
;
"
I
shall
be
resigned
to
all
that
may
be
required
of
me
,
if
I
can
only
know
that
I
shall
not
die
leaving
Perrine
unprotected
.
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
gave
the
promise
 
gave
it
with
his
whole
heart
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
leave
of
Pere
Bonan
,
the
old
man
said
to
him
:
  
"
Come
here
to
-
morrow
;
I
shall
know
more
then
than
I
know
now
 
I
shall
be
able
to
fix
with
certainty
the
day
for
the
fulfillment
of
your
engagement
with
Perrine
.
"
  
<EOS>
Why
did
Gabriel
hesitate
at
the
farmhouse
door
,
looking
back
on
Pere
Bonan
as
though
he
would
fain
say
something
,
and
yet
not
speaking
a
word
?
<EOS>
Why
,
after
he
had
gone
out
and
had
walked
onward
several
paces
,
did
he
suddenly
stop
,
return
quickly
to
the
farmhouse
,
stand
irresolute
before
the
gate
,
and
then
retrace
his
steps
,
sighing
heavily
as
he
went
,
but
never
pausing
again
on
his
homeward
way
?
<EOS>
Because
the
torment
of
his
horrible
secret
had
grown
harder
to
bear
than
ever
,
since
he
had
given
the
promise
that
had
been
required
of
him
.
<EOS>
Because
,
while
a
strong
impulse
moved
him
frankly
to
lay
bare
his
hidden
dread
and
doubt
to
the
father
whose
beloved
daughter
was
soon
to
be
his
wife
,
there
was
a
yet
stronger
passive
influence
which
paralyzed
on
his
lips
the
terrible
confession
that
he
knew
not
whether
he
was
the
son
of
an
honest
man
,
or
the
son
of
an
assassin
,
and
a
robber
.
<EOS>
Made
desperate
by
his
situation
,
he
determined
,
while
he
hastened
homeward
,
to
risk
the
worst
,
and
ask
that
fatal
question
of
his
father
in
plain
words
.
<EOS>
But
this
supreme
trial
for
parent
and
child
was
not
to
be
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
cottage
,
Francois
was
absent
.
<EOS>
He
had
told
the
younger
children
that
he
should
not
be
home
again
before
noon
on
the
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
Early
in
the
morning
Gabriel
repaired
to
the
farmhouse
,
as
he
had
been
bidden
.
<EOS>
Influenced
,
by
his
love
for
Perrine
,
blindly
confiding
in
the
faint
hope
(
which
,
in
despite
of
heart
and
conscience
,
he
still
forced
himself
to
cherish
)
that
his
father
might
be
innocent
,
he
now
preserved
the
appearance
at
least
of
perfect
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
tell
my
secret
to
Perrine
's
father
,
I
risk
disturbing
in
him
that
confidence
in
the
future
safety
of
his
child
for
which
I
am
his
present
and
only
warrant
.
"
Something
like
this
thought
was
in
Gabriel
's
mind
,
as
he
took
the
hand
of
Pere
Bonan
,
and
waited
anxiously
to
hear
what
was
required
of
him
on
that
day
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
a
short
respite
from
danger
,
Gabriel
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
News
has
come
to
me
that
the
spoilers
of
our
churches
and
the
murderers
of
our
congregations
have
been
stopped
on
their
way
hitherward
by
tidings
which
have
reached
them
from
another
district
.
<EOS>
This
interval
of
peace
and
safety
will
be
a
short
one
 
we
must
take
advantage
of
it
while
it
is
yet
ours
.
<EOS>
My
name
is
among
the
names
on
the
list
of
the
denounced
.
<EOS>
If
the
soldiers
of
the
Republic
find
me
here
 
<EOS>
but
we
will
say
nothing
more
of
this
;
it
is
of
Perrine
and
of
you
that
I
must
now
speak
.
<EOS>
On
this
very
evening
your
marriage
may
be
solemnized
with
all
the
wonted
rites
of
our
holy
religion
,
and
the
blessing
may
be
pronounced
over
you
by
the
lips
of
a
priest
.
<EOS>
This
evening
,
therefore
,
Gabriel
,
you
must
become
the
husband
and
the
protector
of
Perrine
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
attentively
,
and
I
will
tell
you
how
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
substance
of
what
Gabriel
now
heard
from
Pere
Bonan
:
  
Not
very
long
before
the
persecutions
broke
out
in
Brittany
,
a
priest
,
known
generally
by
the
name
of
Father
Paul
,
was
appointed
to
a
curacy
in
one
of
the
northern
districts
of
the
province
.
<EOS>
He
fulfilled
all
the
duties
of
his
station
in
such
a
manner
as
to
win
the
confidence
and
affection
of
every
member
of
his
congregation
,
and
was
often
spoken
of
with
respect
,
even
in
parts
of
the
country
distant
from
the
scene
of
his
labors
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
,
however
,
until
the
troubles
broke
out
,
and
the
destruction
and
bloodshed
began
,
that
he
became
renowned
far
and
wide
,
from
one
end
of
Brittany
to
another
.
<EOS>
From
the
date
of
the
very
first
persecutions
the
name
of
Father
Paul
was
a
rallying
-
cry
of
the
hunted
peasantry
;
he
was
their
great
encouragement
under
oppression
,
their
example
in
danger
,
their
last
and
only
consoler
in
the
hour
of
death
.
<EOS>
Wherever
havoc
and
ruin
raged
most
fiercely
,
wherever
the
pursuit
was
hottest
and
the
slaughter
most
cruel
,
there
the
intrepid
priest
was
sure
to
be
seen
pursuing
his
sacred
duties
in
defiance
of
every
peril
.
<EOS>
His
hair
-
breadth
escapes
from
death
;
his
extraordinary
re
-
appearances
in
parts
of
the
country
where
no
one
ever
expected
to
see
him
again
,
were
regarded
by
the
poorer
classes
with
superstitious
awe
.
<EOS>
Wherever
Father
Paul
appeared
,
with
his
black
dress
,
his
calm
face
,
and
the
ivory
crucifix
which
he
always
carried
in
his
hand
,
the
people
reverenced
him
as
more
than
mortal
;
and
grew
at
last
to
believe
,
that
,
single
-
handed
,
he
would
successfully
defend
his
religion
against
the
armies
of
the
Republic
.
<EOS>
But
their
simple
confidence
in
his
powers
of
resistance
was
soon
destined
to
be
shaken
.
<EOS>
Fresh
re
-
enforcements
arrived
in
Brittany
,
and
overran
the
whole
province
from
one
end
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
One
morning
,
after
celebrating
service
in
a
dismantled
church
,
and
after
narrowly
escaping
with
his
life
from
those
who
pursued
him
,
the
priest
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Secret
inquiries
were
made
after
him
in
all
directions
;
but
he
was
heard
of
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
Many
weary
days
had
passed
,
and
the
dispirited
peasantry
had
already
mourned
him
as
dead
,
when
some
fishermen
on
the
northern
coast
observed
a
ship
of
light
burden
in
the
offing
,
making
signals
to
the
shore
.
<EOS>
They
put
off
to
her
in
their
boats
;
and
on
reaching
the
deck
saw
standing
before
them
the
well
-
remembered
figure
of
Father
Paul
.
  
<EOS>
The
priest
had
returned
to
his
congregations
,
and
had
founded
the
new
altar
that
they
were
to
worship
at
on
the
deck
of
the
ship
!
<EOS>
Razed
from
the
face
of
the
earth
,
their
church
had
not
been
destroyed
 
for
Father
Paul
and
the
priests
who
acted
with
him
had
given
that
church
a
refuge
on
the
sea
.
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
their
children
could
still
be
baptized
,
their
sons
and
daughters
could
still
be
married
,
the
burial
of
their
dead
could
still
be
solemnized
,
under
the
sanction
of
the
old
religion
for
which
,
not
vainly
,
they
had
suffered
so
patiently
and
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
Throughout
the
remaining
time
of
trouble
the
services
were
uninterrupted
on
board
the
ship
.
<EOS>
A
code
of
signals
was
established
by
which
those
on
shore
were
always
enabled
to
direct
their
brethren
at
sea
toward
such
parts
of
the
coast
as
happened
to
be
uninfested
by
the
enemies
of
their
worship
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
Gabriel
's
visit
to
the
farmhouse
these
signals
had
shaped
the
course
of
the
ship
toward
the
extremity
of
the
peninsula
of
Quiberon
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
district
were
all
prepared
to
expect
the
appearance
of
the
vessel
some
time
in
the
evening
,
and
had
their
boats
ready
at
a
moment
's
notice
to
put
off
,
and
attend
the
service
.
<EOS>
At
the
conclusion
of
this
service
Pere
Bonan
had
arranged
that
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
and
Gabriel
was
to
take
place
.
  
<EOS>
They
waited
for
evening
at
the
farmhouse
.
<EOS>
A
little
before
sunset
the
ship
was
signaled
as
in
sight
;
and
then
Pere
Bonan
and
his
wife
,
followed
by
Gabriel
and
Perrine
,
set
forth
over
the
heath
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
With
the
solitary
exception
of
Francois
Sarzeau
,
the
whole
population
of
the
neighborhood
was
already
assembled
there
,
Gabriel
's
brother
and
sisters
being
among
the
number
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
calmest
evening
that
had
been
known
for
months
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
cloud
in
the
lustrous
sky
 
not
a
ripple
on
the
still
surface
of
the
sea
.
<EOS>
The
smallest
children
were
suffered
by
their
mothers
to
stray
down
on
the
beach
as
they
pleased
;
for
the
waves
of
the
great
ocean
slept
as
tenderly
and
noiselessly
on
their
sandy
bed
as
if
they
had
been
changed
into
the
waters
of
an
inland
lake
.
<EOS>
Slow
,
almost
imperceptible
,
was
the
approach
of
the
ship
 
there
was
hardly
a
breath
of
wind
to
carry
her
on
 
<EOS>
she
was
just
drifting
gently
with
the
landward
set
of
the
tide
at
that
hour
,
while
her
sails
hung
idly
against
the
masts
.
<EOS>
Long
after
the
sun
had
gone
down
,
the
congregation
still
waited
and
watched
on
the
beach
.
<EOS>
The
moon
and
stars
were
arrayed
in
their
glory
of
the
night
before
the
ship
dropped
anchor
.
<EOS>
Then
the
muffled
tolling
of
a
bell
came
solemnly
across
the
quiet
waters
;
and
then
,
from
every
creek
along
the
shore
,
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
,
the
black
forms
of
the
fishermen
's
boats
shot
out
swift
and
stealthy
into
the
shining
sea
.
  
<EOS>
By
the
time
the
boats
had
arrived
alongside
of
the
ship
,
the
lamp
had
been
kindled
before
the
altar
,
and
its
flame
was
gleaming
red
and
dull
in
the
radiant
moonlight
.
<EOS>
Two
of
the
priests
on
board
were
clothed
in
their
robes
of
office
,
and
were
waiting
in
their
appointed
places
to
begin
the
service
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
third
,
dressed
only
in
the
ordinary
attire
of
his
calling
,
who
mingled
with
the
congregation
,
and
spoke
a
few
words
to
each
of
the
persons
composing
it
,
as
,
one
by
one
<EOS>
,
they
mounted
the
sides
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
Those
who
had
never
seen
him
before
knew
by
the
famous
ivory
crucifix
in
his
hand
that
the
priest
who
received
them
was
Father
Paul
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
looked
at
this
man
,
whom
he
now
beheld
for
the
first
time
,
with
a
mixture
of
astonishment
and
awe
;
for
he
saw
that
the
renowned
chief
of
the
Christians
of
Brittany
was
,
to
all
appearance
,
but
little
older
than
himself
.
  
<EOS>
The
expression
on
the
pale
,
calm
face
of
the
priest
was
so
gentle
and
kind
,
that
children
just
able
to
walk
tottered
up
to
him
,
and
held
familiarly
by
the
skirts
of
his
black
gown
,
whenever
his
clear
blue
eyes
rested
on
theirs
,
while
he
beckoned
them
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
No
one
would
ever
have
guessed
from
the
countenance
of
Father
Paul
what
deadly
perils
he
had
confronted
,
but
for
the
scar
of
a
saber
-
wound
,
as
yet
hardly
healed
,
which
ran
across
his
forehead
.
<EOS>
That
wound
had
been
dealt
while
he
was
kneeling
before
the
altar
in
the
last
church
in
Brittany
which
had
escaped
spoliation
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
died
where
he
knelt
,
but
for
the
peasants
who
were
praying
with
him
,
and
who
,
unarmed
as
they
were
,
threw
themselves
like
tigers
on
the
soldiery
,
and
at
awful
sacrifice
of
their
own
lives
saved
the
life
of
their
priest
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
man
now
on
board
the
ship
who
would
have
hesitated
,
had
the
occasion
called
for
it
again
,
to
have
rescued
him
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
service
began
.
<EOS>
Since
the
days
when
the
primitive
Christians
worshiped
amid
the
caverns
of
the
earth
,
can
any
service
be
imagined
nobler
in
itself
,
or
sublimer
in
the
circumstances
surrounding
it
,
than
that
which
was
now
offered
up
?
<EOS>
Here
was
no
artificial
pomp
,
no
gaudy
profusion
of
ornament
,
no
attendant
grandeur
of
man
's
creation
.
<EOS>
All
around
this
church
spread
the
hushed
and
awful
majesty
of
the
tranquil
sea
.
<EOS>
The
roof
of
this
cathedral
was
the
immeasurable
heaven
,
the
pure
moon
<EOS>
its
one
great
light
,
the
countless
glories
of
the
stars
its
only
adornment
.
<EOS>
Here
were
no
hired
singers
or
rich
priest
-
princes
;
no
curious
sight
-
seers
,
or
careless
lovers
of
sweet
sounds
.
<EOS>
This
congregation
and
they
who
had
gathered
it
together
,
were
all
poor
alike
,
all
persecuted
alike
,
all
worshiping
alike
,
to
the
overthrow
of
their
worldly
interests
,
and
at
the
imminent
peril
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
How
brightly
and
tenderly
the
moonlight
shone
upon
the
altar
and
the
people
before
it
!
<EOS>
how
solemnly
and
divinely
the
deep
harmonies
,
as
they
chanted
the
penitential
Psalms
,
mingled
with
the
hoarse
singing
of
the
freshening
night
breeze
in
the
rigging
of
the
ship
!
<EOS>
how
sweetly
the
still
rushing
murmur
of
many
voices
,
as
they
uttered
the
responses
together
,
now
died
away
,
and
now
rose
again
softly
into
the
mysterious
night
!
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
members
of
the
congregation
 
young
or
old
 
there
was
but
one
over
whom
that
impressive
service
exercised
no
influence
of
consolation
or
of
peace
;
that
one
was
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
Often
,
throughout
the
day
,
his
reproaching
conscience
had
spoken
within
him
again
and
again
.
<EOS>
Often
when
he
joined
the
little
assembly
on
the
beach
,
he
turned
away
his
face
in
secret
shame
and
apprehension
from
Perrine
and
her
father
.
<EOS>
Vainly
,
after
gaining
the
deck
of
the
ship
,
did
he
try
to
meet
the
eye
of
Father
Paul
as
frankly
,
as
readily
,
and
as
affectionately
as
others
met
it
.
<EOS>
The
burden
of
concealment
seemed
too
heavy
to
be
borne
in
the
presence
of
the
priest
 
and
yet
,
torment
as
it
was
,
he
still
bore
it
!
<EOS>
But
when
he
knelt
with
the
rest
of
the
congregation
and
saw
Perrine
kneeling
by
his
side
 
when
he
felt
the
calmness
of
the
solemn
night
and
the
still
sea
filling
his
heart
 
<EOS>
when
the
sounds
of
the
first
prayers
spoke
with
a
dread
spiritual
language
of
their
own
to
his
soul
 
<EOS>
then
the
remembrance
of
the
confession
which
he
had
neglected
,
and
the
terror
of
receiving
unprepared
the
sacrament
which
he
knew
would
be
offered
to
him
 
grew
too
vivid
to
be
endured
;
the
sense
that
he
merited
no
longer
,
though
once
worthy
of
it
,
the
confidence
in
his
perfect
truth
and
candor
placed
in
him
by
the
woman
with
whom
he
was
soon
to
stand
before
the
altar
,
overwhelmed
him
with
shame
:
the
mere
act
of
kneeling
among
that
congregation
,
the
passive
accomplice
by
his
silence
and
secrecy
,
for
aught
he
knew
to
the
contrary
,
of
a
crime
which
it
was
his
bounden
duty
to
denounce
,
appalled
him
as
if
he
had
already
committed
sacrilege
that
could
never
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
Tears
flowed
down
his
cheeks
,
though
he
strove
to
repress
them
:
sobs
burst
from
him
,
though
he
tried
to
stifle
them
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
others
besides
Perrine
were
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
and
alarm
;
but
he
could
neither
control
himself
,
nor
move
to
leave
his
place
,
nor
raise
his
eyes
<EOS>
even
 
until
suddenly
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
That
touch
,
slight
as
it
was
,
ran
through
him
instantly
He
looked
up
,
and
saw
Father
Paul
standing
by
his
side
.
  
<EOS>
Beckoning
him
to
follow
,
and
signing
to
the
congregation
not
to
suspend
their
devotions
,
he
led
Gabriel
out
of
the
assembly
 
then
paused
for
a
moment
,
reflecting
 
then
beckoning
him
again
,
took
him
into
the
cabin
of
the
ship
,
and
closed
the
door
carefully
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
something
on
your
mind
,
"
he
said
,
simply
and
quietly
,
taking
the
young
man
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
able
to
relieve
you
,
if
you
tell
me
what
it
is
.
"
  
<EOS>
As
Gabriel
heard
these
gentle
words
,
and
saw
,
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
which
burned
before
a
cross
fixed
against
the
wall
,
the
sad
kindness
of
expression
with
which
the
priest
was
regarding
him
,
the
oppression
that
had
lain
so
long
on
his
heart
seemed
to
leave
it
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
The
haunting
fear
of
ever
divulging
his
fatal
suspicions
and
his
fatal
secret
had
vanished
,
as
it
were
,
at
the
touch
of
Father
Paul
's
hand
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
he
now
repeated
to
another
ear
 
<EOS>
the
sounds
of
prayer
and
praise
rising
grandly
the
while
from
the
congregation
above
 
his
grandfather
's
death
-
bed
confession
,
word
for
word
almost
,
as
he
had
heard
it
in
the
cottage
on
the
night
of
the
storm
.
  
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
did
Father
Paul
interrupt
the
narrative
,
which
in
whispers
was
addressed
to
him
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
had
hardly
repeated
the
first
two
or
three
sentences
of
his
grandfather
's
confession
,
when
the
priest
,
in
quick
,
altered
tones
,
abruptly
asked
him
his
name
and
place
of
abode
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
question
was
answered
,
Father
Paul
's
calm
face
became
suddenly
agitated
;
but
the
next
moment
,
resolutely
resuming
his
self
-
possession
,
he
bowed
his
head
as
a
sign
that
Gabriel
was
to
continue
;
clasped
his
trembling
hands
,
and
raising
them
as
if
in
silent
prayer
,
fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
the
cross
.
<EOS>
He
never
looked
away
from
it
while
the
terrible
narrative
proceeded
.
<EOS>
But
when
Gabriel
described
his
search
at
the
Merchant
's
Table
;
and
,
referring
to
his
father
's
behavior
since
that
time
,
appealed
to
the
priest
to
know
whether
he
might
even
yet
,
in
defiance
of
appearances
,
be
still
filially
justified
in
doubting
whether
the
crime
had
been
really
perpetrated
 
then
Father
Paul
moved
near
to
him
once
more
,
and
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
,
and
look
at
me
,
"
he
said
,
with
his
former
sad
kindness
of
voice
and
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
end
your
doubts
forever
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
your
father
was
guilty
in
intention
and
in
act
;
but
the
victim
of
his
crime
still
lives
.
<EOS>
I
can
prove
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
's
heart
beat
wildly
;
a
deadly
coldness
crept
over
him
as
he
saw
Father
Paul
loosen
the
fastening
of
his
cassock
round
the
throat
.
  
<EOS>
At
that
instant
the
chanting
of
the
congregation
above
ceased
;
and
then
the
sudden
and
awful
stillness
was
deepened
rather
than
interrupted
by
the
faint
sound
of
one
voice
praying
.
<EOS>
Slowly
and
with
trembling
fingers
the
priest
removed
the
band
round
<EOS>
his
neck
 
paused
a
little
 
sighed
heavily
 
and
pointed
to
a
scar
which
was
now
plainly
visible
on
one
side
of
his
throat
.
<EOS>
He
said
something
at
the
same
time
;
but
the
bell
above
tolled
while
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
signal
of
the
elevation
of
the
Host
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
felt
an
arm
passed
round
him
,
guiding
him
to
his
knees
,
and
sustaining
him
from
sinking
to
the
floor
.
<EOS>
For
one
moment
longer
he
was
conscious
that
the
bell
had
stopped
,
that
there
was
dead
silence
,
that
Father
Paul
was
kneeling
by
him
beneath
the
cross
,
with
bowed
head
 
then
all
objects
around
vanished
;
and
he
saw
and
knew
nothing
more
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
recovered
his
senses
,
he
was
still
in
the
cabin
;
the
man
whose
life
his
father
had
attempted
was
bending
over
him
,
and
sprinkling
water
on
his
face
;
and
the
clear
voices
of
the
women
and
children
of
the
congregation
were
joining
the
voices
of
the
men
in
singing
the
Agnus
Dei
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
up
at
me
without
fear
,
Gabriel
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
desire
not
to
avenge
injuries
:
I
visit
not
the
sins
of
the
father
on
the
child
.
<EOS>
Look
up
,
and
listen
!
<EOS>
I
have
strange
things
to
speak
of
;
and
I
have
a
sacred
mission
to
fulfill
before
the
morning
,
in
which
you
must
be
my
guide
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
attempted
to
kneel
and
kiss
his
hand
but
Father
Paul
stopped
him
,
and
said
,
pointing
to
the
cross
:
"
Kneel
to
that
 
not
to
me
;
not
to
your
fellow
-
mortal
,
and
your
friend
 
for
I
will
be
your
friend
,
Gabriel
;
believing
that
God
's
mercy
has
ordered
it
so
.
<EOS>
And
now
listen
to
me
,
"
he
proceeded
,
with
a
brotherly
tenderness
in
his
manner
which
went
to
Gabriel
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
service
is
nearly
ended
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
tell
you
must
be
told
at
once
;
the
errand
on
which
you
will
guide
me
must
be
performed
before
to
-
morrow
dawns
.
<EOS>
Sit
here
near
me
,
and
attend
to
what
I
now
say
!
"
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
obeyed
;
Father
Paul
then
proceeded
thus
:
  
"
<EOS>
I
believe
the
confession
made
to
you
by
your
grandfather
to
have
been
true
in
every
particular
.
<EOS>
On
the
evening
to
which
he
referred
you
,
I
approached
your
cottage
,
as
he
said
,
for
the
purpose
of
asking
shelter
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
At
that
period
I
had
been
studying
hard
to
qualify
myself
for
the
holy
calling
which
I
now
pursue
;
and
,
on
the
completion
of
my
studies
,
had
indulged
in
the
recreation
of
a
tour
on
foot
through
Brittany
,
by
way
of
innocently
and
agreeably
occupying
the
leisure
time
then
at
my
disposal
,
before
I
entered
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
When
I
accosted
your
father
I
had
lost
my
way
,
had
been
walking
for
many
hours
,
and
was
glad
of
any
rest
that
I
could
get
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
It
is
unnecessary
to
pain
you
now
,
by
reference
to
the
events
which
followed
my
entrance
under
your
father
's
roof
.
<EOS>
I
remember
nothing
that
happened
from
the
time
when
I
lay
down
to
sleep
before
the
fire
,
until
the
time
when
I
recovered
my
senses
at
the
place
which
you
call
the
Merchant
's
Table
.
<EOS>
My
first
sensation
was
that
of
being
moved
into
the
cold
air
;
when
I
opened
my
eyes
I
saw
the
great
Druid
stones
rising
close
above
me
,
and
two
men
on
either
side
of
me
rifling
my
pockets
.
<EOS>
They
found
nothing
valuable
there
,
and
were
about
to
leave
me
where
I
lay
,
when
I
gathered
strength
enough
to
appeal
to
their
mercy
through
their
cupidity
.
<EOS>
Money
was
not
scarce
with
me
then
,
and
I
was
able
to
offer
them
a
rich
reward
(
which
they
ultimately
received
as
I
had
promised
)
if
they
would
take
me
to
any
place
where
I
could
get
shelter
and
medical
help
.
<EOS>
I
supposed
they
inferred
by
my
language
and
accent
 
perhaps
also
by
the
linen
I
wore
,
which
they
examined
closely
 
that
I
belonged
to
the
higher
ranks
of
the
community
,
in
spite
of
the
plainness
of
my
outer
garments
;
and
might
,
therefore
,
be
in
a
position
to
make
good
my
promise
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
heard
one
say
to
the
other
,
"
Let
us
risk
it
'
;
and
then
they
took
me
in
their
arms
,
carried
me
down
to
a
boat
on
the
beach
,
and
rowed
to
a
vessel
in
the
offing
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
they
disembarked
me
at
Paimboeuf
,
where
I
got
the
assistance
which
I
so
much
needed
.
<EOS>
I
learned
,
through
the
confidence
they
were
obliged
to
place
in
me
in
order
to
give
me
the
means
of
sending
them
their
promised
reward
,
that
these
men
were
smugglers
,
and
that
they
were
in
the
habit
of
using
the
cavity
in
which
I
had
been
laid
as
a
place
of
concealment
for
goods
,
and
for
letters
of
advice
to
their
accomplices
.
<EOS>
This
accounted
for
their
finding
me
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
wound
,
I
was
informed
by
the
surgeon
who
attended
me
that
it
had
missed
being
inflicted
in
a
mortal
part
by
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
inch
,
and
that
,
as
it
was
,
nothing
but
the
action
of
the
night
air
in
coagulating
the
blood
over
the
place
,
had
,
in
the
first
instance
,
saved
my
life
.
<EOS>
To
be
brief
,
I
recovered
after
a
long
illness
,
returned
to
Paris
,
and
was
called
to
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
The
will
of
my
superiors
obliged
me
to
perform
the
first
duties
of
my
vocation
in
the
great
city
;
but
my
own
wish
was
to
be
appointed
to
a
cure
of
souls
in
your
province
,
Gabriel
.
<EOS>
Can
you
imagine
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
answer
to
this
question
was
in
Gabriel
's
heart
;
but
he
was
still
too
deeply
awed
and
affected
by
what
he
had
heard
to
give
it
utterance
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
you
,
then
,
what
my
motive
was
,
"
said
Father
Paul
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
first
that
I
uniformly
abstained
from
disclosing
to
any
one
where
and
by
whom
my
life
had
been
attempted
.
<EOS>
I
kept
this
a
secret
from
the
men
who
rescued
me
 
from
the
surgeon
 
from
my
own
friends
even
.
<EOS>
My
reason
for
such
a
proceeding
was
,
I
would
fain
believe
,
a
Christian
reason
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
had
always
felt
a
sincere
and
humble
desire
to
prove
myself
,
by
the
help
of
God
,
worthy
of
the
sacred
vocation
to
which
I
was
destined
.
<EOS>
But
my
miraculous
escape
from
death
made
an
impression
on
my
mind
,
which
gave
me
another
and
an
infinitely
higher
view
of
this
vocation
 
<EOS>
the
view
which
I
have
since
striven
,
and
shall
always
strive
for
the
future
,
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
As
I
lay
,
during
the
first
days
of
my
recovery
,
examining
my
own
heart
,
and
considering
in
what
manner
it
would
be
my
duty
to
act
toward
your
father
when
I
was
restored
to
health
,
a
thought
came
into
my
mind
which
calmed
,
comforted
,
and
resolved
all
my
doubts
.
<EOS>
I
said
within
myself
,
"
In
a
few
months
more
I
shall
be
called
to
be
one
of
the
chosen
ministers
of
God
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
worthy
of
my
vocation
,
my
first
desire
toward
this
man
who
has
attempted
to
take
my
life
should
be
,
not
to
know
that
human
justice
has
overtaken
him
,
but
to
know
that
he
has
truly
and
religiously
repented
and
made
atonement
for
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
To
such
repentance
and
atonement
let
it
be
my
duty
to
call
him
;
if
he
reject
that
appeal
,
and
be
hardened
only
the
more
against
me
because
I
have
forgiven
him
my
injuries
,
then
it
will
be
time
enough
to
denounce
him
for
his
crimes
to
his
fellow
-
men
.
<EOS>
Surely
it
must
be
well
for
me
,
here
and
hereafter
,
if
I
begin
my
career
in
the
holy
priesthood
by
helping
to
save
from
hell
the
soul
of
the
man
who
,
of
all
others
,
has
most
cruelly
wronged
me
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
for
this
reason
,
Gabriel
 
<EOS>
it
was
because
I
desired
to
go
straightway
to
your
father
's
cottage
,
and
reclaim
him
after
he
had
believed
me
to
be
dead
 
that
I
kept
the
secret
and
entreated
of
my
superiors
that
I
might
be
sent
to
Brittany
.
<EOS>
But
this
,
as
I
have
said
,
was
not
to
be
at
first
,
and
when
my
desire
was
granted
,
my
place
was
assigned
me
in
a
far
district
.
<EOS>
The
persecution
under
which
we
still
suffer
broke
out
;
the
designs
of
my
life
were
changed
;
my
own
will
became
no
longer
mine
to
guide
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
through
sorrow
and
suffering
,
and
danger
and
bloodshed
,
I
am
now
led
,
after
many
days
,
to
the
execution
of
that
first
purpose
which
I
formed
on
entering
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
,
when
the
service
is
over
,
and
the
congregation
are
dispersed
,
you
must
guide
me
to
the
door
of
your
father
's
cottage
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
held
up
his
hand
,
in
sign
of
silence
,
as
Gabriel
was
about
to
answer
.
<EOS>
Just
then
the
officiating
priests
above
were
pronouncing
the
final
benediction
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
over
,
Father
Paul
opened
the
cabin
door
.
<EOS>
As
he
ascended
the
steps
,
followed
by
Gabriel
,
Pere
Bonan
met
them
.
<EOS>
The
old
man
looked
doubtfully
and
searchingly
on
his
future
son
-
in
-
law
,
as
he
respectfully
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
ear
of
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Father
Paul
listened
attentively
,
answered
in
a
whisper
,
and
then
turned
to
Gabriel
,
first
begging
the
few
people
near
them
to
withdraw
a
little
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
asked
whether
there
is
any
impediment
to
your
marriage
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
have
answered
that
there
is
none
.
<EOS>
What
you
have
said
to
me
has
been
said
in
confession
,
and
is
a
secret
between
us
two
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
;
and
forget
not
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
service
which
I
shall
require
of
you
to
-
night
,
after
the
marriage
-
ceremony
is
over
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Perrine
Bonan
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
aloud
,
looking
round
him
.
<EOS>
Perrine
came
forward
.
<EOS>
Father
Paul
took
her
hand
and
placed
it
in
Gabriel
's
.
"
<EOS>
Lead
her
to
the
altar
steps
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
wait
there
for
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
more
than
an
hour
later
;
the
boats
had
left
the
ship
's
side
;
the
congregation
had
dispersed
over
the
face
of
the
country
 
<EOS>
but
still
the
vessel
remained
at
anchor
.
<EOS>
Those
who
were
left
in
her
watched
the
land
more
anxiously
than
usual
;
for
they
knew
that
Father
Paul
had
risked
meeting
the
soldiers
of
the
Republic
by
trusting
himself
on
shore
.
<EOS>
A
boat
was
awaiting
his
return
on
the
beach
;
half
of
the
crew
,
armed
,
being
posted
as
scouts
in
various
directions
on
the
high
land
of
the
heath
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
followed
and
guarded
the
priest
to
the
place
of
his
destination
;
but
he
forbade
it
;
and
,
leaving
them
abruptly
,
walked
swiftly
onward
with
one
young
man
only
for
his
companion
.
  
<EOS>
Gabriel
had
committed
his
brother
and
his
sisters
to
the
charge
of
Perrine
.
<EOS>
They
were
to
go
to
the
farmhouse
that
night
with
his
newly
-
married
wife
and
her
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
Father
Paul
had
desired
that
this
might
be
done
.
<EOS>
When
Gabriel
and
he
were
left
alone
to
follow
the
path
which
led
to
the
fisherman
's
cottage
,
the
priest
never
spoke
while
they
walked
on
 
never
looked
aside
either
to
the
right
or
the
left
 
always
held
his
ivory
crucifix
clasped
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
They
arrived
at
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Knock
,
"
whispered
Father
Paul
to
Gabriel
,
"
and
then
wait
here
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
door
was
opened
.
<EOS>
On
a
lovely
moonlight
night
Francois
Sarzeau
had
stood
on
that
threshold
,
years
since
,
with
a
bleeding
body
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
On
a
lovely
moonlight
night
he
now
stood
there
again
,
confronting
the
very
man
whose
life
he
had
attempted
,
and
knowing
him
not
.
  
<EOS>
Father
Paul
advanced
a
few
paces
,
so
that
the
moonlight
fell
fuller
on
his
features
,
and
removed
his
hat
.
  
<EOS>
Francois
Sarzeau
looked
,
started
,
moved
one
step
back
,
then
stood
motionless
and
perfectly
silent
,
while
all
traces
of
expression
of
any
kind
suddenly
vanished
from
his
face
.
<EOS>
Then
the
calm
,
clear
tones
of
the
priest
stole
gently
on
the
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
"
I
bring
a
message
of
peace
and
forgiveness
from
a
guest
of
former
years
,
"
he
said
;
and
pointed
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
place
where
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
neck
.
  
<EOS>
For
one
moment
,
Gabriel
saw
his
father
trembling
violently
from
head
to
foot
 
<EOS>
then
his
limbs
steadied
again
 
<EOS>
stiffened
suddenly
,
as
if
struck
by
catalepsy
.
<EOS>
His
lips
parted
,
but
without
quivering
;
his
eyes
glared
,
but
without
moving
in
the
orbits
.
<EOS>
The
lovely
moonlight
itself
looked
ghastly
and
horrible
,
shining
on
the
supernatural
panic
deformity
of
that
face
!
<EOS>
Gabriel
turned
away
his
head
in
terror
.
<EOS>
He
heard
the
voice
of
Father
Paul
saying
to
him
:
"
Wait
here
till
I
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
Then
there
was
an
instant
of
silence
again
 
then
a
low
groaning
sound
that
seemed
to
articulate
the
name
of
God
;
a
sound
unlike
his
father
's
voice
,
unlike
any
human
voice
he
had
ever
heard
 
and
then
the
noise
of
a
closing
door
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
,
and
saw
that
he
was
standing
alone
before
the
cottage
.
  
<EOS>
Once
,
after
an
interval
,
he
approached
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
He
just
saw
through
it
the
hand
of
the
priest
holding
on
high
the
ivory
crucifix
;
but
stopped
not
to
see
more
,
for
he
heard
such
words
,
such
sounds
,
as
drove
him
back
to
his
former
place
.
<EOS>
There
he
stayed
,
until
the
noise
of
something
falling
heavily
within
the
cottage
struck
on
his
ear
.
<EOS>
Again
he
advanced
toward
the
door
;
heard
Father
Paul
praying
;
listened
for
several
minutes
;
then
heard
a
moaning
voice
,
now
joining
itself
to
the
voice
of
the
priest
,
now
choked
in
sobs
and
bitter
wailing
.
<EOS>
Once
more
he
went
back
out
of
hearing
,
and
stirred
not
again
from
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
waited
a
long
and
a
weary
time
there
 
so
long
that
one
of
the
scouts
on
the
lookout
came
toward
him
,
evidently
suspicious
of
the
delay
in
the
priest
's
return
.
<EOS>
He
waved
the
man
back
,
and
then
looked
again
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
saw
it
open
 
<EOS>
saw
Father
Paul
approach
him
,
leading
Francois
Sarzeau
by
the
hand
.
  
<EOS>
The
fisherman
never
raised
his
downcast
eyes
to
his
son
's
face
;
tears
trickled
silently
over
his
cheeks
;
he
followed
the
hand
that
led
him
,
as
a
little
child
might
have
followed
it
,
listened
anxiously
and
humbly
at
the
priest
's
side
to
every
word
that
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
"
said
Father
Paul
,
in
a
voice
which
trembled
a
little
for
the
first
time
that
night
 
<EOS>
"
Gabriel
,
it
has
pleased
God
to
grant
the
perfect
fulfillment
of
the
purpose
which
brought
me
to
this
place
;
I
tell
you
this
,
as
all
that
you
need
 
as
all
,
I
believe
,
that
you
would
wish
 
to
know
of
what
has
passed
while
you
have
been
left
waiting
for
me
here
.
<EOS>
Such
words
as
I
have
now
to
speak
to
you
are
spoken
by
your
father
's
earnest
desire
.
<EOS>
It
is
his
own
wish
that
I
should
communicate
to
you
his
confession
of
having
secretly
followed
you
to
the
Merchant
's
Table
,
and
of
having
discovered
(
as
you
discovered
)
that
no
evidence
of
his
guilt
remained
there
.
<EOS>
This
admission
,
he
thinks
,
will
be
enough
to
account
for
his
conduct
toward
yourself
from
that
time
to
this
.
<EOS>
I
have
next
to
tell
you
(
also
at
your
father
's
desire
)
that
he
has
promised
in
my
presence
,
and
now
promises
again
in
yours
,
sincerity
of
repentance
in
this
manner
:
When
the
persecution
of
our
religion
has
ceased
 
as
cease
it
will
,
and
that
speedily
,
be
assured
of
it
 
he
solemnly
pledges
himself
henceforth
to
devote
his
life
,
his
strength
and
what
worldly
possessions
he
may
have
,
or
may
acquire
,
to
the
task
of
re
-
erecting
and
restoring
the
road
-
side
crosses
which
have
been
sacrilegiously
overthrown
and
destroyed
in
his
native
province
,
and
to
doing
good
,
go
where
he
may
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
said
all
that
is
required
of
me
,
and
may
bid
you
farewell
 
bearing
with
me
the
happy
remembrance
that
I
have
left
a
father
and
son
reconciled
and
restored
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
May
God
bless
and
prosper
you
,
and
those
dear
to
you
,
Gabriel
!
<EOS>
May
God
accept
your
father
's
repentance
,
and
bless
him
also
throughout
his
future
life
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
their
hands
,
pressed
them
long
and
warmly
,
then
turned
and
walked
quickly
down
the
path
which
led
to
the
beach
.
<EOS>
Gabriel
dared
not
trust
himself
yet
to
speak
;
but
he
raised
his
arm
,
and
put
it
gently
round
his
father
's
neck
.
<EOS>
The
two
stood
together
so
,
looking
out
dimly
through
the
tears
that
filled
their
eyes
to
the
sea
.
<EOS>
They
saw
the
boat
put
off
in
the
bright
track
of
the
moonlight
,
and
reach
the
vessel
's
side
;
they
watched
the
spreading
of
the
sails
,
and
followed
the
slow
course
of
the
ship
till
she
disappeared
past
a
distant
headland
from
sight
.
  
<EOS>
After
that
,
they
went
into
the
cottage
together
.
<EOS>
They
knew
it
not
then
,
but
they
had
seen
the
last
,
in
this
world
,
of
Father
Paul
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
events
foretold
by
the
good
priest
happened
sooner
even
than
he
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
A
new
government
ruled
the
destinies
of
France
,
and
the
persecution
ceased
in
Brittany
.
  
<EOS>
Among
other
propositions
which
were
then
submitted
to
the
Parliament
,
was
one
advocating
the
restoration
of
the
road
-
side
crosses
throughout
the
province
.
<EOS>
It
was
found
,
however
,
on
inquiry
,
that
these
crosses
were
to
be
counted
by
thousands
,
and
that
the
mere
cost
of
wood
required
to
re
-
erect
them
necessitated
an
expenditure
of
money
which
the
bankrupt
nation
could
ill
afford
to
spare
.
<EOS>
While
this
project
was
under
discussion
,
and
before
it
was
finally
rejected
,
one
man
had
undertaken
the
task
which
the
Government
shrank
from
attempting
.
<EOS>
When
Gabriel
left
the
cottage
,
taking
his
brother
and
sisters
to
live
with
his
wife
and
himself
at
the
farmhouse
,
Francois
Sarzeau
left
it
also
,
to
perform
in
highway
and
byway
his
promise
to
Father
Paul
.
<EOS>
For
months
and
months
he
labored
without
intermission
at
his
task
;
still
,
always
doing
good
,
and
rendering
help
and
kindness
and
true
charity
to
any
whom
he
could
serve
.
<EOS>
He
walked
many
a
weary
mile
,
toiled
through
many
a
hard
day
's
work
,
humbled
himself
even
to
beg
of
others
,
to
get
wood
enough
to
restore
a
single
cross
.
<EOS>
No
one
ever
heard
him
complain
,
ever
saw
him
impatient
,
ever
detected
him
in
faltering
at
his
task
.
<EOS>
The
shelter
in
an
outhouse
,
the
crust
of
bread
and
drink
of
water
,
which
he
could
always
get
from
the
peasantry
,
seemed
to
suffice
him
.
<EOS>
Among
the
people
who
watched
his
perseverance
,
a
belief
began
to
gain
ground
that
his
life
would
be
miraculously
prolonged
until
he
had
completed
his
undertaking
from
one
end
of
Brittany
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
seen
one
cold
autumn
evening
,
silently
and
steadily
at
work
as
usual
,
setting
up
a
new
cross
on
the
site
of
one
which
had
been
shattered
to
splinters
in
the
troubled
times
.
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
was
found
lying
dead
beneath
the
sacred
symbol
which
his
own
hands
had
completed
and
erected
in
its
place
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
They
buried
him
where
he
lay
;
and
the
priest
who
consecrated
the
ground
allowed
Gabriel
to
engrave
his
father
's
epitaph
in
the
wood
of
the
cross
.
<EOS>
It
was
simply
the
initial
letters
of
the
dead
man
's
name
,
followed
by
this
inscription
:
"
Pray
for
the
repose
of
his
soul
:
he
died
penitent
,
and
the
doer
of
good
works
.
"
  
<EOS>
Once
,
and
once
only
,
did
Gabriel
hear
anything
of
Father
Paul
.
<EOS>
The
good
priest
showed
,
by
writing
to
the
farmhouse
,
that
he
had
not
forgotten
the
family
so
largely
indebted
to
him
for
their
happiness
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
dated
"
Rome
.
"
<EOS>
Father
Paul
said
that
such
services
as
he
had
been
permitted
to
render
to
the
Church
in
Brittany
had
obtained
for
him
a
new
and
a
far
more
glorious
trust
than
any
he
had
yet
held
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
recalled
from
his
curacy
,
and
appointed
to
be
at
the
head
of
a
mission
which
was
shortly
to
be
dispatched
to
convert
the
inhabitants
of
a
savage
and
far
distant
land
to
the
Christian
faith
.
<EOS>
He
now
wrote
,
as
his
brethren
with
him
were
writing
,
to
take
leave
of
all
friends
forever
in
this
world
,
before
setting
out
 
for
it
was
well
known
to
the
chosen
persons
intrusted
with
the
new
mission
that
they
could
only
hope
to
advance
its
object
by
cheerfully
risking
their
own
lives
for
the
sake
of
their
religion
.
<EOS>
He
gave
his
blessing
to
Francois
Sarzeau
,
to
Gabriel
,
and
to
his
family
;
and
bade
them
affectionately
farewell
for
the
last
time
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
postscript
to
the
letter
,
which
was
addressed
to
Perrine
,
and
which
she
often
read
afterward
with
tearful
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
writer
begged
that
,
if
she
should
have
any
children
,
she
would
show
her
friendly
and
Christian
remembrance
of
him
by
teaching
them
to
pray
(
as
he
hoped
she
herself
would
pray
)
that
a
blessing
might
attend
Father
Paul
's
labors
in
the
distant
land
.
  
<EOS>
The
priest
's
loving
petition
was
never
forgotten
.
<EOS>
When
Perrine
taught
its
first
prayer
to
her
first
child
,
the
little
creature
was
instructed
to
end
the
few
simple
words
pronounced
at
its
mother
's
knees
,
with
,
"
God
bless
Father
Paul
.
"
  
<EOS>
In
those
words
the
nun
concluded
her
narrative
.
<EOS>
After
it
was
ended
,
she
pointed
to
the
old
wooden
cross
,
and
said
to
me
:
  
"
That
was
one
of
the
many
that
he
made
.
<EOS>
It
was
found
,
a
few
years
since
,
to
have
suffered
so
much
from
exposure
to
the
weather
that
it
was
unfit
to
remain
any
longer
in
its
old
place
.
<EOS>
A
priest
in
Brittany
gave
it
to
one
of
the
nuns
in
this
convent
.
<EOS>
Do
you
wonder
now
that
the
Mother
Superior
always
calls
it
a
Relic
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
I
answered
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
should
have
small
respect
indeed
for
the
religious
convictions
of
any
one
who
could
hear
the
story
of
that
wooden
cross
,
and
not
feel
that
the
Mother
Superior
's
name
for
it
is
the
very
best
that
could
have
been
chosen
.

PROLOGUE
TO
THE
SIXTH
STORY
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
last
occasion
when
I
made
a
lengthened
stay
in
London
,
my
wife
and
I
were
surprised
and
amused
one
morning
by
the
receipt
of
the
following
note
,
addressed
to
me
in
a
small
,
crabbed
,
foreign
-
looking
handwriting
.
  
<EOS>
"
Professor
Tizzi
presents
amiable
compliments
to
Mr.
Kerby
,
the
artist
,
and
is
desirous
of
having
his
portrait
done
,
to
be
engraved
from
,
and
placed
at
the
beginning
of
the
voluminous
work
on
"
The
Vital
Principle
;
or
,
Invisible
Essence
of
Life
,
"
which
the
Professor
is
now
preparing
for
the
press
 
and
posterity
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Professor
will
give
five
pounds
;
and
will
look
upon
his
face
with
satisfaction
,
as
an
object
perpetuated
for
public
contemplation
at
a
reasonable
rate
,
if
Mr.
Kerby
will
accept
the
sum
just
mentioned
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
regard
to
the
Professor
's
ability
to
pay
five
pounds
,
as
well
as
to
offer
them
,
if
Mr.
Kerby
should
,
from
ignorance
,
entertain
injurious
doubts
,
he
is
requested
to
apply
to
the
Professor
's
honorable
friend
,
Mr.
Lanfray
,
of
Rockleigh
Place
.
"
  
<EOS>
But
for
the
reference
at
the
end
of
this
strange
note
,
I
should
certainly
have
considered
it
as
a
mere
trap
set
to
make
a
fool
of
me
by
some
mischievous
friend
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
I
rather
doubted
the
propriety
of
taking
any
serious
notice
of
Professor
Tizzi
's
offer
;
and
I
might
probably
have
ended
by
putting
the
letter
in
the
fire
without
further
thought
about
it
,
but
for
the
arrival
by
the
next
post
of
a
note
from
Mr.
Lanfray
,
which
solved
all
my
doubts
,
and
sent
me
away
at
once
to
make
the
acquaintance
of
the
learned
discoverer
of
the
Essence
of
Life
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
not
be
surprised
"
(
Mr.
Lanfray
wrote
)
"
if
you
get
a
strange
note
from
a
very
eccentric
Italian
,
one
Professor
Tizzi
,
formerly
of
the
University
of
Padua
.
<EOS>
I
have
known
him
for
some
years
.
<EOS>
Scientific
inquiry
is
his
monomania
,
and
vanity
his
ruling
passion
.
<EOS>
He
has
written
a
book
on
the
principle
of
life
,
which
nobody
but
himself
will
ever
read
;
but
which
he
is
determined
to
publish
,
with
his
own
portrait
for
frontispiece
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
worth
your
while
to
accept
the
little
he
can
offer
you
,
take
it
by
all
means
,
for
he
is
a
character
worth
knowing
.
<EOS>
He
was
exiled
,
I
should
tell
you
,
years
ago
,
for
some
absurd
political
reason
,
and
has
lived
in
England
ever
since
.
<EOS>
All
the
money
he
inherits
from
his
father
,
who
was
a
mail
contractor
in
the
north
of
Italy
,
goes
in
books
and
experiments
;
but
I
think
I
can
answer
for
his
solvency
,
at
any
rate
,
for
the
large
sum
of
five
pounds
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
not
very
much
occupied
just
now
,
go
and
see
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
sure
to
amuse
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Professor
Tizzi
lived
in
the
northern
suburb
of
London
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
his
house
,
I
found
it
,
so
far
as
outward
appearance
went
,
excessively
dirty
and
neglected
,
but
in
no
other
respect
different
from
the
"
villas
"
in
its
neighborhood
.
<EOS>
The
front
garden
door
,
after
I
had
rang
twice
,
was
opened
by
a
yellow
-
faced
,
suspicious
old
foreigner
,
dressed
in
worn
-
out
clothes
,
and
completely
and
consistently
dirty
all
over
,
from
top
to
toe
.
<EOS>
On
mentioning
my
name
and
business
,
this
old
man
led
me
across
a
weedy
,
neglected
garden
,
and
admitted
me
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
At
the
first
step
into
the
passage
,
I
was
surrounded
by
books
.
<EOS>
Closely
packed
in
plain
wooden
shelves
,
they
ran
all
along
the
wall
on
either
side
to
the
back
of
the
house
;
and
when
I
looked
up
at
the
carpetless
staircase
,
I
saw
nothing
but
books
again
,
running
all
the
way
up
the
wall
,
as
far
as
my
eye
could
reach
.
"
<EOS>
Here
is
the
Artist
Painter
!
"
cried
the
old
servant
,
throwing
open
one
of
the
parlor
doors
,
before
I
had
half
done
looking
at
the
books
,
and
signing
impatiently
to
me
to
walk
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Books
again
!
<EOS>
all
round
the
walls
,
and
all
over
the
floor
 
among
them
a
plain
deal
table
,
with
leaves
of
manuscript
piled
high
on
every
part
of
it
 
among
the
leaves
a
head
of
long
,
elfish
white
hair
covered
with
a
black
skull
-
cap
,
and
bent
down
over
a
book
 
above
the
head
a
sallow
,
withered
hand
shaking
itself
at
me
as
a
sign
that
I
must
not
venture
to
speak
just
at
that
moment
 
on
the
tops
of
the
bookcases
<EOS>
glass
vases
full
of
spirits
of
some
kind
,
with
horrible
objects
floating
in
the
liquid
 
dirt
on
the
window
panes
,
<EOS>
cobwebs
hanging
from
the
ceiling
,
dust
springing
up
in
clouds
under
my
intruding
feet
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
things
I
observed
on
first
entering
the
study
of
Professor
Tizzi
.
  
<EOS>
After
I
had
waited
for
a
minute
or
so
,
the
shaking
hand
stopped
,
descended
with
a
smack
on
the
nearest
pile
of
manuscript
,
seized
the
book
that
the
head
had
been
bending
over
,
and
flung
it
contemptuously
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
refuted
you
,
at
any
rate
!
"
said
Professor
Tizzi
,
looking
with
extreme
complacency
at
the
cloud
of
dust
raised
by
the
fall
of
the
rejected
volume
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
next
to
me
.
<EOS>
What
a
grand
face
it
was
!
<EOS>
What
a
broad
,
white
forehead
 
<EOS>
what
fiercely
brilliant
black
eyes
 
<EOS>
what
perfect
regularity
and
refinement
in
the
other
features
;
with
the
long
,
venerable
hair
,
framing
them
in
,
as
it
were
,
on
either
side
!
<EOS>
Poor
as
I
was
,
I
felt
that
I
could
have
painted
his
portrait
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
Titian
,
Vandyke
,
Valasquez
 
any
of
the
three
would
have
paid
him
to
sit
to
them
!
  
<EOS>
"
Accept
my
humblest
excuses
,
sir
,
"
said
the
old
man
,
speaking
English
with
a
singularly
pure
accent
for
a
foreigner
.
<EOS>
"
That
absurd
book
plunged
me
so
deep
down
in
the
quagmires
of
sophistry
and
error
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
that
I
really
could
not
get
to
the
surface
at
once
when
you
came
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
So
you
are
willing
to
draw
my
likeness
for
such
a
small
sum
as
five
pounds
?
<EOS>
"
he
continued
,
rising
,
and
showing
me
that
he
wore
a
long
black
velvet
gown
,
instead
of
the
paltry
and
senseless
costume
of
modern
times
.
  
<EOS>
I
informed
him
that
five
pounds
was
as
much
as
I
generally
got
for
a
drawing
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
little
,
"
said
the
professor
;
"
but
if
you
want
fame
,
I
can
make
it
up
to
you
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
There
is
my
great
work
"
(
he
pointed
to
the
piles
of
manuscript
)
,
"
the
portrait
of
my
mind
and
the
mirror
of
my
learning
;
put
a
likeness
of
my
face
on
the
first
page
,
and
posterity
will
then
be
thoroughly
acquainted
with
me
,
outside
and
in
.
<EOS>
Your
portrait
will
be
engraved
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
and
your
name
shall
be
inscribed
under
the
print
.
<EOS>
You
shall
be
associated
,
sir
,
in
that
way
,
with
a
work
which
will
form
an
epoch
in
the
history
of
human
science
.
<EOS>
The
Vital
Principle
 
<EOS>
or
,
in
other
words
,
the
essence
of
that
mysterious
Something
which
we
call
Life
,
and
which
extends
down
from
Man
to
the
feeblest
insect
and
the
smallest
plant
 
has
been
an
unguessed
riddle
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
to
the
present
time
.
<EOS>
I
alone
have
found
the
answer
;
and
here
it
is
!
"
<EOS>
He
fixed
his
dazzling
eyes
on
me
in
triumph
,
and
smacked
the
piles
of
manuscript
fiercely
with
both
his
sallow
hands
.
  
<EOS>
I
saw
that
he
was
waiting
for
me
to
say
something
;
so
I
asked
if
his
great
work
had
not
cost
a
vast
expenditure
of
time
and
pains
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
seventy
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Professor
;
"
and
I
began
preparing
myself
for
that
book
at
twenty
.
<EOS>
After
mature
consideration
,
I
have
written
it
in
English
(
having
three
other
foreign
languages
at
my
fingers
'
ends
)
,
as
a
substantial
proof
of
my
gratitude
to
the
nation
that
has
given
me
an
asylum
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
think
the
work
looks
rather
long
in
its
manuscript
state
?
<EOS>
It
will
occupy
twelve
volumes
,
sir
,
and
it
is
not
half
long
enough
,
even
then
,
for
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
take
two
volumes
(
and
no
man
could
do
it
in
less
)
to
examine
the
theories
of
all
the
philosophers
in
the
world
,
ancient
and
modern
,
on
the
Vital
Principle
.
<EOS>
I
take
two
more
(
and
little
enough
)
to
scatter
every
one
of
the
theories
,
seriatim
,
to
the
winds
.
<EOS>
I
take
two
more
(
at
the
risk
,
for
brevity
's
sake
,
of
doing
things
by
halves
)
to
explain
the
exact
stuff
,
or
vital
compound
,
of
which
the
first
man
and
woman
in
the
world
were
made
 
calling
them
Adam
and
Eve
,
out
of
deference
to
popular
prejudices
.
<EOS>
I
take
two
more
 
<EOS>
but
you
are
standing
all
this
time
,
Mr.
Kerby
;
and
I
am
talking
instead
of
sitting
for
my
portrait
.
<EOS>
Pray
take
any
books
you
want
,
anywhere
off
the
floor
,
and
make
a
seat
of
any
height
you
please
.
<EOS>
Furniture
would
only
be
in
my
way
here
,
so
I
do
n't
trouble
myself
with
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
obediently
followed
the
Professor
's
directions
,
and
had
just
heaped
up
a
pile
of
grimy
quartos
,
when
the
old
servant
entered
the
room
with
a
shabby
little
tray
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
tray
I
saw
a
crust
of
bread
and
a
bit
of
garlic
,
encircled
by
a
glass
of
water
,
a
knife
,
salt
,
pepper
,
a
bottle
of
vinegar
,
and
a
flask
of
oil
.
  
<EOS>
"
With
your
permission
,
I
am
going
to
breakfast
,
"
said
Professor
Tizzi
,
as
the
tray
was
set
down
before
him
on
the
part
of
his
great
work
relating
to
the
vital
compound
of
Adam
and
Eve
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
he
took
up
the
piece
of
bread
,
and
rubbed
the
crusty
part
of
it
with
the
bit
of
garlic
,
till
it
looked
as
polished
as
a
new
dining
-
table
.
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
turned
the
bread
,
crumb
uppermost
,
and
saturated
it
with
oil
,
added
a
few
drops
of
vinegar
,
sprinkled
with
pepper
and
salt
,
and
,
with
a
gleam
of
something
very
like
greediness
in
his
bright
eyes
,
took
up
the
knife
to
cut
himself
a
first
mouthful
of
the
horrible
mess
that
he
had
just
concocted
.
<EOS>
"
The
best
of
breakfasts
,
"
said
the
Professor
,
seeing
me
look
amazed
.
<EOS>
"
Not
a
cannibal
meal
of
chicken
-
life
in
embryo
(
vulgarly
called
an
egg
)
;
not
a
dog
's
gorge
of
a
dead
animal
's
flesh
,
blood
and
bones
,
warmed
with
fire
(
popularly
known
as
a
chop
)
;
not
a
breakfast
,
sir
,
that
lions
,
tigers
,
Caribbees
,
and
costermongers
could
all
partake
of
alike
;
but
an
innocent
,
nutritive
,
simple
,
vegetable
meal
;
a
philosopher
's
refection
,
a
breakfast
that
a
prize
-
fighter
would
turn
from
in
disgust
,
and
that
a
Plato
would
share
with
relish
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
was
right
,
and
that
I
was
prejudiced
;
but
as
I
saw
the
first
oily
,
vinegary
,
garlicky
morsel
slide
noiselessly
into
his
mouth
,
I
began
to
feel
rather
sick
.
<EOS>
My
hands
were
dirty
with
moving
the
books
,
and
I
asked
if
I
could
wash
them
before
beginning
to
work
at
the
likeness
,
as
a
good
excuse
for
getting
out
of
the
room
,
while
Professor
Tizzi
was
unctuously
disposing
of
his
simple
vegetable
meal
.
  
<EOS>
The
philosopher
looked
a
little
astonished
at
my
request
,
as
if
the
washing
of
hands
at
irregular
times
and
seasons
offered
a
comparatively
new
subject
of
contemplation
to
him
;
but
he
rang
a
hand
-
bell
on
his
table
immediately
,
and
told
the
old
servant
to
take
me
up
into
his
bedroom
.
  
<EOS>
The
interior
of
the
parlor
had
astonished
me
;
but
a
sight
of
the
bedroom
was
a
new
sensation
 
not
of
the
most
agreeable
kind
.
<EOS>
The
couch
on
which
the
philosopher
sought
repose
after
his
labors
was
a
truckle
-
bed
that
would
not
have
fetched
half
a
crown
at
a
sale
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
of
it
dangled
from
the
ceiling
a
complete
male
skeleton
,
looking
like
all
that
was
left
of
a
man
who
might
have
hung
himself
about
a
century
ago
,
and
who
had
never
been
disturbed
since
the
moment
of
his
suicide
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
side
of
the
bed
stood
a
long
press
,
in
which
I
observed
hideous
colored
preparations
of
the
muscular
system
,
and
bottles
with
curious
,
twining
,
thread
-
like
substances
inside
them
,
which
might
have
been
remarkable
worms
or
dissections
of
nerves
,
scattered
amicably
side
by
side
with
the
Professor
's
hair
-
brush
(
three
parts
worn
out
)
,
with
remnants
of
his
beard
on
bits
of
shaving
-
paper
,
with
a
broken
shoe
-
horn
,
and
with
a
traveling
looking
-
glass
of
the
sort
usually
sold
at
sixpence
apiece
.
<EOS>
Repetitions
of
the
litter
of
books
in
the
parlor
lay
all
about
over
the
floor
;
colored
anatomical
prints
were
nailed
anyhow
against
the
walls
;
rolled
-
up
towels
were
scattered
here
,
there
,
and
everywhere
in
the
wildest
confusion
,
as
if
the
room
had
been
bombarded
with
them
;
and
last
,
but
by
no
means
least
remarkable
among
the
other
extraordinary
objects
in
the
bed
-
chamber
,
the
stuffed
figure
of
a
large
unshaven
poodle
-
dog
,
stood
on
an
old
card
-
table
,
keeping
perpetual
watch
over
a
pair
of
the
philosopher
's
black
breeches
twisted
round
his
forepaws
.
  
<EOS>
I
had
started
,
on
entering
the
room
,
at
the
skeleton
,
and
I
started
once
more
at
the
dog
.
<EOS>
The
old
servant
noticed
me
each
time
with
a
sardonic
grin
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
,
"
he
said
;
"
one
is
as
dead
as
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
left
me
to
wash
my
hands
.
  
<EOS>
Finding
little
more
than
a
pint
of
water
at
my
disposal
,
and
failing
altogether
to
discover
where
the
soap
was
kept
,
I
was
not
long
in
performing
my
ablutions
.
<EOS>
Before
leaving
the
room
,
I
looked
again
at
the
stuffed
poodle
.
<EOS>
On
the
board
to
which
he
was
fixed
,
I
saw
painted
in
faded
letters
the
word
"
Scarammuccia
,
"
evidently
the
comic
Italian
name
to
which
he
had
answered
in
his
lifetime
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
other
inscription
;
but
I
made
up
my
mind
that
the
dog
must
have
been
the
Professor
's
pet
,
and
that
he
kept
the
animal
stuffed
in
his
bedroom
as
a
remembrance
of
past
times
.
<EOS>
"
Who
would
have
suspected
so
great
a
philosopher
of
having
so
much
heart
!
"
<EOS>
thought
I
,
leaving
the
bedroom
to
go
downstairs
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
Professor
had
done
his
breakfast
,
and
was
anxious
to
begin
the
sitting
;
so
I
took
out
my
chalks
and
paper
,
and
set
to
work
at
once
 
I
seated
on
one
pile
of
books
and
he
on
another
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fine
anatomical
preparations
in
my
room
,
are
there
not
,
Mr.
Kerby
?
"
said
the
old
gentleman
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
notice
a
very
interesting
and
perfect
arrangement
of
the
intestinal
ganglia
?
<EOS>
They
form
the
subject
of
an
important
chapter
in
my
great
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
very
ignorant
,
"
I
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
really
do
not
know
the
intestinal
ganglia
when
I
see
them
.
<EOS>
The
object
I
noticed
with
most
curiosity
in
your
room
was
something
more
on
a
level
with
my
own
small
capacity
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
was
that
?
"
asked
the
Professor
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
figure
of
the
stuffed
poodle
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
he
was
a
favorite
of
yours
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Of
mine
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
;
<EOS>
a
young
woman
's
favorite
,
sir
,
before
I
was
born
;
and
a
very
remarkable
dog
,
too
.
<EOS>
The
vital
principle
in
that
poodle
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
must
have
been
singularly
intensified
.
<EOS>
He
lived
to
a
fabulous
old
age
,
and
he
was
clever
enough
to
play
an
important
part
of
his
own
in
what
you
English
call
a
Romance
of
Real
Life
!
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
have
dissected
that
poodle
,
I
would
have
put
him
into
my
book
;
he
should
have
headed
my
chapter
on
the
Vital
Principle
of
Beasts
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
is
a
story
in
prospect
,
"
thought
I
,
"
if
I
can
only
keep
his
attention
up
to
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
He
should
have
figured
in
my
great
work
,
sir
,
"
the
Professor
went
on
.
"
<EOS>
Scarammuccia
should
have
taken
his
place
among
the
examples
that
prove
my
new
theory
;
but
unfortunately
he
died
before
I
was
born
.
<EOS>
His
mistress
gave
him
,
stuffed
,
as
you
see
upstairs
,
to
my
father
to
take
care
of
for
her
,
and
he
has
descended
as
an
heirloom
to
me
.
<EOS>
Talking
of
dogs
,
Mr.
Kerby
,
I
have
ascertained
,
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
,
that
the
brachial
plexus
in
people
who
die
of
hydrophobia
 
but
stop
!
<EOS>
I
had
better
show
you
how
it
is
 
<EOS>
the
preparation
is
upstairs
under
my
wash
-
hand
stand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
left
his
seat
as
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
In
another
minute
he
would
have
sent
the
servant
to
fetch
the
"
preparation
,
"
and
I
should
have
lost
the
story
.
<EOS>
At
the
risk
of
his
taking
offense
,
I
begged
him
not
to
move
just
then
,
unless
he
wished
me
to
spoil
his
likeness
.
<EOS>
This
alarmed
,
but
fortunately
did
not
irritate
him
.
<EOS>
He
returned
to
his
seat
,
and
I
resumed
the
subject
of
the
stuffed
poodle
,
asking
him
boldly
to
tell
me
the
story
with
which
the
dog
was
connected
.
<EOS>
The
demand
seemed
to
impress
him
with
no
very
favorable
opinion
of
my
intellectual
tastes
;
but
he
complied
with
it
,
and
related
,
not
without
many
a
wearisome
digression
to
the
subject
of
his
great
work
,
the
narrative
which
I
propose
calling
by
the
name
of
"
The
Yellow
Mask
.
"
<EOS>
After
the
slight
specimens
that
I
have
given
of
his
character
and
style
of
conversation
,
it
will
be
almost
unnecessary
for
me
to
premise
that
I
tell
this
story
as
I
have
told
the
last
,
and
"
Sister
Rose
,
"
in
my
own
language
,
and
according
to
my
own
plan
in
the
disposition
of
the
incidents
 
adding
nothing
,
of
course
,
to
the
facts
,
but
keeping
them
within
the
limits
which
my
disposable
space
prescribes
to
me
.
  
<EOS>
I
may
perhaps
be
allowed
to
add
in
this
place
,
that
I
have
not
yet
seen
or
heard
of
my
portrait
in
an
engraved
state
.
<EOS>
Professor
Tizzi
is
still
alive
;
but
I
look
in
vain
through
the
publishers
'
lists
for
an
announcement
of
his
learned
work
on
the
Vital
Principle
.
<EOS>
Possibly
he
may
be
adding
a
volume
or
two
to
the
twelve
already
completed
,
by
way
of
increasing
the
debt
which
a
deeply
obliged
posterity
is
,
sooner
or
later
,
sure
of
owing
to
him
.

THE
PROFESSOR
'S
STORY
  
OF
  
THE
YELLOW
MASK
.
  
<EOS>
PART
FIRST
.
  
<EOS>
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
century
ago
,
there
lived
in
the
ancient
city
of
Pisa
a
famous
Italian
milliner
,
who
,
by
way
of
vindicating
to
all
customers
her
familiarity
with
Paris
fashions
,
adopted
a
French
title
,
and
called
herself
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
wizen
little
woman
with
a
mischievous
face
,
a
quick
tongue
,
a
nimble
foot
,
a
talent
for
business
,
and
an
uncertain
disposition
.
<EOS>
Rumor
hinted
that
she
was
immensely
rich
,
and
scandal
suggested
that
she
would
do
anything
for
money
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
undeniable
good
quality
which
raised
Demoiselle
Grifoni
above
all
her
rivals
in
the
trade
was
her
inexhaustible
fortitude
.
<EOS>
She
was
never
known
to
yield
an
inch
under
any
pressure
of
adverse
circumstances
<EOS>
Thus
the
memorable
occasion
of
her
life
on
which
she
was
threatened
with
ruin
was
also
the
occasion
on
which
she
most
triumphantly
asserted
the
energy
and
decision
of
her
character
.
<EOS>
At
the
height
of
the
demoiselle
's
prosperity
her
skilled
forewoman
and
cutter
-
out
basely
married
and
started
in
business
as
her
rival
.
<EOS>
Such
a
calamity
as
this
would
have
ruined
an
ordinary
milliner
;
but
the
invincible
Grifoni
rose
superior
to
it
almost
without
an
effort
,
and
proved
incontestably
that
it
was
impossible
for
hostile
Fortune
to
catch
her
at
the
end
of
her
resources
.
<EOS>
While
the
minor
milliners
were
prophesying
that
she
would
shut
up
shop
,
she
was
quietly
carrying
on
a
private
correspondence
with
an
agent
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
Nobody
knew
what
these
letters
were
about
until
a
few
weeks
had
elapsed
,
and
then
circulars
were
received
by
all
the
ladies
in
Pisa
,
announcing
that
the
best
French
forewoman
who
could
be
got
for
money
was
engaged
to
superintend
the
great
Grifoni
establishment
.
<EOS>
This
master
-
stroke
decided
the
victory
.
<EOS>
All
the
demoiselle
's
customers
declined
giving
orders
elsewhere
until
the
forewoman
from
Paris
had
exhibited
to
the
natives
of
Pisa
the
latest
fashions
from
the
metropolis
of
the
world
of
dress
.
  
<EOS>
The
Frenchwoman
arrived
punctual
to
the
appointed
day
 
glib
and
curt
,
smiling
and
flippant
,
tight
of
face
and
supple
of
figure
.
<EOS>
Her
name
was
Mademoiselle
Virginie
,
and
her
family
had
inhumanly
deserted
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
set
to
work
the
moment
she
was
inside
the
doors
of
the
Grifoni
establishment
.
<EOS>
A
room
was
devoted
to
her
own
private
use
;
magnificent
materials
in
velvet
,
silk
,
and
satin
,
with
due
accompaniment
of
muslins
,
laces
,
and
ribbons
were
placed
at
her
disposal
;
she
was
told
to
spare
no
expense
,
and
to
produce
,
in
the
shortest
possible
time
,
the
finest
and
nearest
specimen
dresses
for
exhibition
in
the
show
-
room
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
undertook
to
do
everything
required
of
her
,
produced
her
portfolios
of
patterns
and
her
book
of
colored
designs
,
and
asked
for
one
assistant
who
could
speak
French
enough
to
interpret
her
orders
to
the
Italian
girls
in
the
work
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
the
very
person
you
want
,
"
cried
Demoiselle
Grifoni
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
work
-
woman
we
call
Brigida
here
 
the
idlest
slut
in
Pisa
,
but
as
sharp
as
a
needle
 
has
been
in
France
,
and
speaks
the
language
like
a
native
.
<EOS>
I
'll
send
her
to
you
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
was
not
left
long
alone
with
her
patterns
and
silks
.
<EOS>
A
tall
woman
,
with
bold
black
eyes
,
a
reckless
manner
,
and
a
step
as
firm
as
a
man
's
,
stalked
into
the
room
with
the
gait
of
a
tragedy
-
queen
crossing
the
stage
.
<EOS>
The
instant
her
eyes
fell
on
the
French
forewoman
,
she
stopped
,
threw
up
her
hands
in
astonishment
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
Finette
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Teresa
!
"
cried
the
Frenchwoman
,
casting
her
scissors
on
the
table
,
and
advancing
a
few
steps
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
call
me
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
call
me
Virginie
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
These
two
exclamations
were
uttered
at
the
same
moment
,
and
then
the
two
women
scrutinized
each
other
in
silence
.
<EOS>
The
swarthy
cheeks
of
the
Italian
turned
to
a
dull
yellow
,
and
the
voice
of
the
Frenchwoman
trembled
a
little
when
she
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
,
have
you
dropped
down
in
the
world
as
low
as
this
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
were
provided
for
when
"
  
"
Silence
!
"
interrupted
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
You
see
I
was
not
provided
for
.
<EOS>
I
have
had
my
misfortunes
;
and
you
are
the
last
woman
alive
who
ought
to
refer
to
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
I
have
not
had
my
misfortunes
,
too
,
since
we
met
?
"
<EOS>
(
Brigida
's
face
brightened
maliciously
at
those
words
.
)
<EOS>
"
You
have
had
your
revenge
,
"
continued
Mademoiselle
Virginie
,
coldly
,
turning
away
to
the
table
and
taking
up
the
scissors
again
.
  
<EOS>
Brigida
followed
her
,
threw
one
arm
roughly
round
her
neck
,
and
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
be
friends
again
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
The
Frenchwoman
laughed
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
how
I
have
had
my
revenge
,
"
pursued
the
other
,
tightening
her
grasp
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
signed
to
Brigida
to
stoop
,
and
whispered
rapidly
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
The
Italian
listened
eagerly
,
with
fierce
,
suspicious
eyes
fixed
on
the
door
.
<EOS>
When
the
whispering
ceased
,
she
loosened
her
hold
,
and
,
with
a
sigh
of
relief
,
pushed
back
her
heavy
black
hair
from
her
temples
.
<EOS>
"
Now
we
are
friends
,
"
she
said
,
and
sat
down
indolently
in
a
chair
placed
by
the
worktable
.
  
<EOS>
"
Friends
,
"
repeated
Mademoiselle
Virginie
,
with
another
laugh
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
for
business
,
"
she
continued
,
getting
a
row
of
pins
ready
for
use
by
putting
them
between
her
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
,
I
believe
,
for
the
purpose
of
ruining
the
late
forewoman
,
who
has
set
up
in
opposition
to
us
?
<EOS>
Good
!
<EOS>
I
will
ruin
her
.
<EOS>
Spread
out
the
yellow
brocaded
silk
,
my
dear
,
and
pin
that
pattern
on
at
your
end
,
while
I
pin
at
mine
.
<EOS>
And
what
are
your
plans
,
Brigida
?
<EOS>
(
Mind
you
do
n't
forget
that
Finette
is
dead
,
and
that
Virginie
has
risen
from
her
ashes
.
)
<EOS>
You
ca
n't
possibly
intend
to
stop
here
all
your
life
?
<EOS>
(
Leave
an
inch
outside
the
paper
,
all
round
.
)
<EOS>
You
must
have
projects
?
<EOS>
What
are
they
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Look
at
my
figure
,
"
said
Brigida
,
placing
herself
in
an
attitude
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
rejoined
the
other
,
"
it
's
not
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
There
's
too
much
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
want
diet
,
walking
,
and
a
French
stay
-
maker
,
"
muttered
Mademoiselle
Virginie
through
her
chevaus
-
defrise
of
pins
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
the
goddess
Minerva
walk
,
and
employ
a
 
French
stay
-
maker
?
<EOS>
I
thought
she
rode
upon
clouds
,
and
lived
at
a
period
before
waists
were
invented
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
This
 
that
my
present
project
is
to
try
if
I
ca
n't
make
my
fortune
by
sitting
as
a
model
for
Minerva
in
the
studio
of
the
best
sculptor
in
Pisa
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
who
is
he
!
<EOS>
(
Unwind
me
a
yard
or
two
of
that
black
lace
.
)
<EOS>
"
  
"
The
master
-
sculptor
,
Luca
Lomi
 
<EOS>
an
old
family
,
once
noble
,
but
down
in
the
world
now
.
<EOS>
The
master
is
obliged
to
make
statues
to
get
a
living
for
his
daughter
and
himself
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
More
of
the
lace
 
double
it
over
the
bosom
of
the
dress
.
<EOS>
And
how
is
sitting
to
this
needy
sculptor
to
make
your
fortune
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
a
minute
.
<EOS>
There
are
other
sculptors
besides
him
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
There
is
,
first
,
his
brother
,
the
priest
 
Father
Rocco
,
who
passes
all
his
spare
time
with
the
master
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
good
sculptor
in
his
way
 
has
cast
statues
and
made
a
font
for
his
church
 
a
holy
man
,
who
devotes
all
his
work
in
the
studio
to
the
cause
of
piety
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
bah
!
<EOS>
we
should
think
him
a
droll
priest
in
France
.
<EOS>
(
More
pins
.
)
<EOS>
You
do
n't
expect
him
to
put
money
in
your
pocket
,
surely
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Wait
,
I
say
again
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
third
sculptor
in
the
studio
 
actually
a
nobleman
!
<EOS>
His
name
is
Fabio
d'Ascoli
.
<EOS>
He
is
rich
,
young
,
handsome
,
an
only
child
,
and
little
better
than
a
fool
.
<EOS>
Fancy
his
working
at
sculpture
,
as
if
he
had
his
bread
to
get
by
it
 
and
thinking
that
an
amusement
!
<EOS>
Imagine
a
man
belonging
to
one
of
the
best
families
in
Pisa
mad
enough
to
want
to
make
a
reputation
as
an
artist
!
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
wait
!
<EOS>
the
best
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
His
father
and
mother
are
dead
 
<EOS>
he
has
no
near
relations
in
the
world
to
exercise
authority
over
him
 
<EOS>
he
is
a
bachelor
,
and
his
fortune
is
all
at
his
own
disposal
;
going
a
-
begging
,
my
friend
;
absolutely
going
a
-
begging
for
want
of
a
clever
woman
to
hold
out
her
hand
and
take
it
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
 
now
I
understand
.
<EOS>
The
goddess
Minerva
is
a
clever
woman
,
and
she
will
hold
out
her
hand
and
take
his
fortune
from
him
with
the
utmost
docility
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
first
thing
is
to
get
him
to
offer
it
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
you
that
I
am
not
going
to
sit
to
him
,
but
to
his
master
,
Luca
Lomi
,
who
is
doing
the
statue
of
Minerva
.
<EOS>
The
face
is
modeled
from
his
daughter
;
and
now
he
wants
somebody
to
sit
for
the
bust
and
arms
.
<EOS>
Maddalena
Lomi
and
I
are
as
nearly
as
possible
the
same
height
<EOS>
,
I
hear
 
<EOS>
the
difference
between
us
being
that
I
have
a
good
figure
<EOS>
and
she
has
a
bad
one
.
<EOS>
I
have
offered
to
sit
,
through
a
friend
who
is
employed
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
If
the
master
accepts
,
I
am
sure
of
an
introduction
to
our
rich
young
gentleman
;
and
then
leave
it
to
my
good
looks
,
my
various
accomplishments
,
and
my
ready
tongue
,
to
do
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
have
the
lace
doubled
,
on
second
thoughts
.
<EOS>
I
'll
have
it
single
,
and
running
all
round
the
dress
in
curves
 
so
.
<EOS>
Well
,
and
who
is
this
friend
of
yours
<EOS>
employed
in
the
studio
?
<EOS>
A
fourth
sculptor
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
;
the
strangest
,
simplest
little
creature
"
  
<EOS>
Just
then
a
faint
tap
was
audible
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Brigida
laid
her
finger
on
her
lips
,
and
called
impatiently
to
the
person
outside
to
come
in
.
  
<EOS>
The
door
opened
gently
,
and
a
young
girl
,
poorly
but
very
neatly
dressed
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
was
rather
thin
and
under
the
average
height
;
but
her
head
and
figure
were
in
perfect
proportion
.
<EOS>
Her
hair
was
of
that
gorgeous
auburn
color
,
her
eyes
of
that
deep
violet
-
blue
,
which
the
portraits
of
Giorgione
and
Titian
have
made
famous
as
the
type
of
Venetian
beauty
.
<EOS>
Her
features
possessed
the
definiteness
and
regularity
,
the
"
good
modeling
"
(
to
use
an
artist
's
term
)
,
which
is
the
rarest
of
all
womanly
charms
,
in
Italy
as
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
The
one
serious
defect
of
her
face
was
its
paleness
.
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
,
wanting
nothing
in
form
,
wanted
everything
in
color
.
<EOS>
That
look
of
health
,
which
is
the
essential
crowning
-
point
of
beauty
,
was
the
one
attraction
which
her
face
did
not
possess
.
  
<EOS>
She
came
into
the
room
with
a
sad
and
weary
expression
in
her
eyes
,
which
changed
,
however
,
the
moment
she
observed
the
magnificently
-
dressed
French
forewoman
,
into
a
look
of
astonishment
,
and
almost
of
awe
.
<EOS>
Her
manner
became
shy
and
embarrassed
;
and
after
an
instant
of
hesitation
,
she
turned
back
silently
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Stop
,
stop
,
Nanina
,
"
said
Brigida
,
in
Italian
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
that
lady
.
<EOS>
She
is
our
new
forewoman
;
and
she
has
it
in
her
power
to
do
all
sorts
of
kind
things
for
you
.
<EOS>
Look
up
,
and
tell
us
what
you
want
You
were
sixteen
last
birthday
,
<EOS>
Nanina
,
and
you
behave
like
a
baby
of
two
years
old
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
only
came
to
know
if
there
was
any
work
for
me
to
-
day
,
"
said
the
girl
,
<EOS>
in
a
very
sweet
voice
,
that
trembled
a
little
as
she
tried
to
face
the
fashionable
French
forewoman
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
work
,
child
,
that
is
easy
enough
for
you
to
do
,
"
said
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
the
studio
to
-
day
?
"
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
color
that
Nanina
's
cheeks
wanted
began
to
steal
over
them
as
she
answered
"
Yes
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
forget
my
message
,
darling
.
<EOS>
And
if
Master
Luca
Lomi
asks
where
I
live
,
answer
that
you
are
ready
to
deliver
a
letter
to
me
;
but
that
you
are
forbidden
to
enter
into
any
particulars
at
first
about
who
I
am
,
or
where
I
live
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
am
I
forbidden
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Nanina
,
innocently
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
ask
questions
,
baby
!
<EOS>
Do
as
you
are
told
.
<EOS>
Bring
me
back
a
nice
note
or
message
to
-
morrow
from
the
studio
,
and
I
will
intercede
with
this
lady
to
get
you
some
work
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
foolish
child
to
want
it
,
when
you
might
make
more
money
here
and
at
Florence
,
by
sitting
to
painters
and
sculptors
;
though
what
they
can
see
to
paint
or
model
in
you
I
never
could
understand
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
like
working
at
home
better
than
going
abroad
to
sit
,
"
said
Nanina
,
looking
very
much
abashed
as
she
faltered
out
the
answer
,
and
escaping
from
the
room
with
a
terrified
farewell
obeisance
,
which
was
an
eccentric
compound
of
a
start
,
a
bow
,
and
a
courtesy
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
awkward
child
would
be
pretty
,
"
said
Mademoiselle
Virginie
,
making
rapid
progress
with
the
cutting
-
out
of
her
dress
,
"
if
she
knew
how
to
give
herself
a
complexion
,
and
had
a
presentable
gown
on
her
back
.
<EOS>
Who
is
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
friend
who
is
to
get
me
into
Master
Luca
Lomi
's
studio
,
"
replied
Brigida
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Rather
a
curious
ally
for
me
to
take
up
with
,
is
n't
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
meet
with
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Here
,
to
be
sure
;
she
hangs
about
this
place
for
any
plain
work
she
can
get
to
do
,
and
takes
it
home
to
the
oddest
little
room
in
a
street
near
the
Campo
Santo
.
<EOS>
I
had
the
curiosity
to
follow
her
one
day
,
and
knocked
at
her
door
soon
after
she
had
gone
in
,
as
if
I
was
a
visitor
.
<EOS>
She
answered
my
knock
in
a
great
flurry
and
fright
,
as
you
may
imagine
.
<EOS>
I
made
myself
agreeable
,
affected
immense
interest
in
her
affairs
,
and
so
got
into
her
room
.
<EOS>
Such
a
place
!
<EOS>
A
mere
corner
of
it
curtained
off
to
make
a
bedroom
.
<EOS>
One
chair
,
one
stool
,
one
saucepan
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Before
the
hearth
the
most
grotesquely
hideous
unshaven
poodle
-
dog
you
ever
saw
;
and
on
the
stool
a
fair
little
girl
plaiting
dinner
-
mats
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
household
 
furniture
and
all
included
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
your
father
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
"
<EOS>
He
ran
away
and
left
us
years
ago
,
"
answers
my
awkward
little
friend
who
has
just
left
the
room
,
speaking
in
that
simple
way
of
hers
,
with
all
the
composure
in
the
world
.
"
<EOS>
And
your
mother
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Dead
.
"
<EOS>
She
went
up
to
the
little
mat
-
plaiting
girl
as
she
gave
that
answer
,
and
began
playing
with
her
long
flaxen
hair
.
"
<EOS>
Your
sister
,
I
suppose
,
"
said
I.
<EOS>
"
What
is
her
name
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
They
call
me
La
Biondella
,
"
says
the
child
,
looking
up
from
her
mat
<EOS>
(
La
Biondella
,
Virginie
,
means
The
Fair
)
.
"
<EOS>
And
why
do
you
let
that
great
,
shaggy
,
ill
-
looking
brute
lie
before
your
fireplace
?
<EOS>
"
I
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
"
cried
the
little
mat
-
plaiter
,
"
that
is
our
dear
old
dog
,
Scarammuccia
.
<EOS>
He
takes
care
of
the
house
when
Nanina
is
not
at
home
.
<EOS>
He
dances
on
his
hind
legs
,
and
jumps
through
a
hoop
,
and
tumbles
down
dead
when
I
cry
Bang
!
<EOS>
Scarammuccia
followed
us
home
one
night
,
years
ago
,
and
he
has
lived
with
us
ever
since
.
<EOS>
He
goes
out
every
day
by
himself
,
we
ca
n't
tell
where
,
and
generally
returns
licking
his
chops
,
which
makes
us
afraid
that
he
is
a
thief
;
but
nobody
finds
him
out
,
because
he
is
the
cleverest
dog
that
ever
lived
!
"
<EOS>
The
child
ran
on
in
this
way
about
the
great
beast
by
the
fireplace
,
till
I
was
obliged
to
stop
her
;
while
that
simpleton
Nanina
stood
by
,
laughing
and
encouraging
her
.
<EOS>
I
asked
them
a
few
more
questions
,
which
produced
some
strange
answers
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
seem
to
know
of
any
relations
of
theirs
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
The
neighbors
in
the
house
had
helped
them
,
after
their
father
ran
away
,
until
they
were
old
enough
to
help
themselves
;
and
they
did
not
seem
to
think
there
was
anything
in
the
least
wretched
or
pitiable
in
their
way
of
living
.
<EOS>
The
last
thing
I
heard
,
when
I
left
them
that
day
,
was
La
Biondella
crying
"
Bang
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
a
bark
,
a
thump
on
the
floor
,
and
a
scream
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
If
it
was
not
for
their
dog
,
I
should
go
and
see
them
oftener
.
<EOS>
But
the
ill
-
conditioned
beast
has
taken
a
dislike
to
me
,
and
growls
and
shows
his
teeth
whenever
I
come
near
him
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
girl
looked
sickly
when
she
came
in
here
.
<EOS>
Is
she
always
like
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
.
<EOS>
She
has
altered
within
the
last
month
.
<EOS>
I
suspect
our
interesting
young
nobleman
has
produced
an
impression
.
<EOS>
The
oftener
the
girl
has
sat
to
him
lately
,
the
paler
and
more
out
of
spirits
she
has
become
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
<EOS>
she
has
sat
to
him
,
has
she
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
sitting
to
him
now
.
<EOS>
He
is
doing
a
bust
of
some
Pagan
nymph
or
other
,
and
prevailed
on
Nanina
to
let
him
copy
from
her
head
and
face
.
<EOS>
According
to
her
own
account
the
little
fool
was
frightened
at
first
,
and
gave
him
all
the
trouble
in
the
world
before
she
would
consent
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
now
she
has
consented
,
do
n't
you
think
it
likely
she
may
turn
out
rather
a
dangerous
rival
?
<EOS>
Men
are
such
fools
,
and
take
such
fancies
into
their
heads
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ridiculous
!
<EOS>
A
thread
-
paper
of
a
girl
like
that
,
who
has
no
manner
,
no
talk
,
no
intelligence
;
who
has
nothing
to
recommend
her
but
an
awkward
,
babyish
prettiness
!
<EOS>
Dangerous
to
me
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
!
<EOS>
If
there
is
danger
at
all
,
I
have
to
dread
it
from
the
sculptor
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mind
confessing
that
I
am
anxious
to
see
Maddalena
Lomi
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
Nanina
,
she
will
simply
be
of
use
to
me
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
already
about
the
studio
and
the
artists
in
it
,
I
know
through
her
.
<EOS>
She
will
deliver
my
message
,
and
procure
me
my
introduction
;
and
when
we
have
got
so
far
,
I
shall
give
her
an
old
gown
and
a
shake
of
the
hand
;
and
then
,
good
-
by
to
our
little
innocent
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
well
,
for
your
sake
I
hope
you
are
the
wiser
of
the
two
in
this
matter
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
always
distrust
innocence
.
<EOS>
Wait
one
moment
,
and
I
shall
have
the
body
and
sleeves
of
this
dress
ready
for
the
needle
-
women
.
<EOS>
There
,
ring
the
bell
,
and
order
them
up
;
for
I
have
directions
to
give
,
and
you
must
interpret
for
me
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
While
Brigida
went
to
the
bell
,
the
energetic
Frenchwoman
began
planning
out
the
skirt
of
the
new
dress
.
<EOS>
She
laughed
as
she
measured
off
yard
after
yard
of
the
silk
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
are
you
laughing
about
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Brigida
,
opening
the
door
and
ringing
a
hand
-
bell
in
the
passage
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
help
fancying
,
dear
,
in
spite
of
her
innocent
face
and
her
artless
ways
,
that
your
young
friend
is
a
hypocrite
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
I
am
quite
certain
,
love
,
that
she
is
only
a
simpleton
.
<EOS>
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
studio
of
the
master
-
sculptor
,
Luca
Lomi
,
was
composed
of
two
large
rooms
unequally
divided
by
a
wooden
partition
,
with
an
arched
doorway
cut
in
the
middle
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
milliners
of
the
Grifoni
establishment
were
industriously
shaping
dresses
,
the
sculptors
in
Luca
Lomi
's
workshop
were
,
in
their
way
,
quite
as
hard
at
work
shaping
marble
and
clay
.
<EOS>
In
the
smaller
of
the
two
rooms
the
young
nobleman
(
only
addressed
in
the
studio
by
his
Christian
name
of
Fabio
)
was
busily
engaged
on
his
bust
,
with
Nanina
sitting
before
him
as
a
model
.
<EOS>
His
was
not
one
of
those
traditional
Italian
faces
from
which
subtlety
and
suspicion
are
always
supposed
to
look
out
darkly
on
the
world
at
large
.
<EOS>
Both
countenance
and
expression
proclaimed
his
character
frankly
and
freely
to
all
who
saw
him
.
<EOS>
Quick
intelligence
looked
brightly
from
his
eyes
;
and
easy
good
humor
laughed
out
pleasantly
in
the
rather
quaint
curve
of
his
lips
.
<EOS>
For
the
rest
,
his
face
expressed
the
defects
as
well
as
the
merits
of
his
character
,
showing
that
he
wanted
resolution
and
perseverance
just
as
plainly
as
it
showed
also
that
he
possessed
amiability
and
intelligence
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
large
room
,
nearest
to
the
street
door
,
Luca
Lomi
was
standing
by
his
life
-
size
statue
of
Minerva
;
and
was
issuing
directions
,
from
time
to
time
,
to
some
of
his
workmen
,
who
were
roughly
chiseling
the
drapery
of
another
figure
.
<EOS>
At
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
,
nearest
to
the
partition
,
his
brother
,
Father
Rocco
,
was
taking
a
cast
from
a
statuette
of
the
Madonna
;
while
Maddalena
Lomi
,
the
sculptor
's
daughter
,
released
from
sitting
for
Minerva
's
face
,
walked
about
the
two
rooms
,
and
watched
what
was
going
on
in
them
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
strong
family
likeness
of
a
certain
kind
between
father
,
brother
and
daughter
.
<EOS>
All
three
were
tall
,
handsome
,
dark
-
haired
,
and
dark
-
eyed
;
nevertheless
,
they
differed
in
expression
,
strikingly
as
they
resembled
one
another
in
feature
.
<EOS>
Maddalena
Lomi
's
face
betrayed
strong
passions
,
but
not
an
ungenerous
nature
.
<EOS>
Her
father
,
with
the
same
indications
of
a
violent
temper
,
had
some
sinister
lines
about
his
mouth
and
forehead
which
suggested
anything
rather
than
an
open
disposition
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
's
countenance
,
on
the
other
hand
,
looked
like
the
personification
of
absolute
calmness
and
invincible
moderation
;
and
his
manner
,
which
,
in
a
very
firm
way
,
was
singularly
quiet
and
deliberate
,
assisted
in
carrying
out
the
impression
produced
by
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
daughter
seemed
as
if
she
could
fly
into
a
passion
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
and
forgive
also
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
The
father
,
appearing
to
be
just
as
irritable
,
had
something
in
his
face
which
said
,
as
plainly
as
if
in
words
,
"
Anger
me
,
and
I
never
pardon
.
<EOS>
"
The
priest
looked
as
if
he
need
never
be
called
on
either
to
ask
forgiveness
or
to
grant
it
,
for
the
double
reason
that
he
could
irritate
nobody
else
,
and
that
nobody
else
could
irritate
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rocco
,
"
said
Luca
,
looking
at
the
face
of
his
Minerva
,
which
was
now
finished
,
"
this
statue
of
mine
will
make
a
sensation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
rejoined
the
priest
,
dryly
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
new
thing
in
art
,
"
continued
Luca
,
enthusiastically
.
"
<EOS>
Other
sculptors
,
with
a
classical
subject
like
mine
,
limit
themselves
to
the
ideal
classical
face
,
and
never
think
of
aiming
at
individual
character
.
<EOS>
Now
I
do
precisely
the
reverse
of
that
.
<EOS>
I
get
my
handsome
daughter
,
Maddalena
,
to
sit
for
Minerva
,
and
I
make
an
exact
likeness
of
her
.
<EOS>
I
may
lose
in
ideal
beauty
,
but
I
gain
in
individual
character
.
<EOS>
People
may
accuse
me
of
disregarding
established
rules
;
but
my
answer
is
,
that
I
make
my
own
rules
.
<EOS>
My
daughter
looks
like
a
Minerva
,
and
there
she
is
exactly
as
she
looks
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
certainly
a
wonderful
likeness
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
approaching
the
statue
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
the
girl
herself
,
"
cried
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exactly
her
expression
,
and
exactly
her
features
.
<EOS>
Measure
Maddalena
,
and
measure
Minerva
,
and
from
forehead
to
chin
,
you
wo
n't
find
a
hair
-
breadth
of
difference
between
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
about
the
bust
and
arms
of
the
figure
,
now
the
face
is
done
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
priest
,
returning
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
his
own
work
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
have
the
very
model
I
want
for
them
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Little
Nanina
has
just
given
me
the
strangest
message
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
a
mysterious
lady
admirer
who
offers
to
sit
for
the
bust
and
arms
of
my
Minerva
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Are
you
going
to
accept
the
offer
?
"
inquired
the
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
going
to
receive
her
to
-
morrow
;
and
if
I
really
find
that
she
is
the
same
height
as
Maddalena
,
and
has
a
bust
and
arms
worth
modeling
,
of
course
I
shall
accept
her
offer
;
for
she
will
be
the
very
sitter
I
have
been
looking
after
for
weeks
past
.
<EOS>
Who
can
she
be
?
<EOS>
That
's
the
mystery
I
want
to
find
out
.
<EOS>
Which
do
you
say
,
Rocco
 
an
enthusiast
or
an
adventuress
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
presume
to
say
,
for
I
have
no
means
of
knowing
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
there
you
are
with
your
moderation
again
.
<EOS>
Now
,
I
do
presume
to
assert
that
she
must
be
either
one
or
the
other
 
<EOS>
or
she
would
not
have
forbidden
Nanina
to
say
anything
about
her
in
answer
to
all
my
first
natural
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Maddalena
?
<EOS>
I
thought
she
was
here
a
minute
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
in
Fabio
's
room
,
"
answered
Father
Rocco
,
softly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
!
"
returned
Luca
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
looked
round
at
the
workmen
,
who
were
chipping
away
mechanically
at
their
bit
of
drapery
;
then
advanced
close
to
the
priest
,
with
a
cunning
smile
,
and
continued
in
a
whisper
,
"
If
Maddalena
can
only
get
from
Fabio
's
room
here
to
Fabio
's
palace
over
the
way
,
on
the
Arno
 
come
,
come
,
Rocco
!
<EOS>
do
n't
shake
your
head
.
<EOS>
If
I
brought
her
up
to
your
church
door
one
of
these
days
,
as
Fabio
d'Ascoli
's
betrothed
,
you
would
be
glad
enough
to
take
the
rest
of
the
business
off
my
hands
,
and
make
her
Fabio
d'Ascoli
's
wife
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
very
holy
man
,
Rocco
,
but
you
know
the
difference
between
the
clink
of
the
money
-
bag
and
the
clink
of
the
chisel
for
all
that
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
to
find
,
Luca
,
"
returned
the
priest
,
coldly
,
"
that
you
allow
yourself
to
talk
of
the
most
delicate
subjects
in
the
coarsest
way
.
<EOS>
This
is
one
of
the
minor
sins
of
the
tongue
which
is
growing
on
you
.
<EOS>
When
we
are
alone
in
the
studio
,
I
will
endeavor
to
lead
you
into
speaking
of
the
young
man
in
the
room
there
,
and
of
your
daughter
,
<EOS>
in
terms
more
becoming
to
you
,
to
me
,
and
to
them
.
<EOS>
Until
that
time
,
allow
me
to
go
on
with
my
work
.
"
  
<EOS>
Luca
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
went
back
to
his
statue
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
who
had
been
engaged
during
the
last
ten
minutes
in
mixing
wet
plaster
to
the
right
consistency
for
taking
a
cast
,
suspended
his
occupation
;
and
crossing
the
room
to
a
corner
next
the
partition
,
removed
from
it
a
cheval
-
glass
which
stood
there
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
it
away
gently
,
while
his
brother
's
back
was
turned
,
carried
it
close
to
the
table
at
which
he
had
been
at
work
,
and
then
resumed
his
employment
of
mixing
the
plaster
.
<EOS>
Having
at
last
prepared
the
composition
for
use
,
he
laid
it
over
the
exposed
half
of
the
statuette
with
a
neatness
and
dexterity
which
showed
him
to
be
a
practiced
hand
at
cast
-
taking
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
had
covered
the
necessary
extent
of
surface
,
Luca
turned
round
from
his
statue
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
are
you
getting
on
with
the
cast
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
any
help
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
None
,
brother
,
I
thank
you
,
"
answered
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
do
not
disturb
either
yourself
or
your
workmen
on
my
account
.
"
  
Luca
turned
again
to
the
statue
;
and
,
at
the
same
moment
,
Father
Rocco
softly
moved
the
cheval
-
glass
toward
the
open
doorway
between
the
two
rooms
,
placing
it
at
such
an
angle
as
to
make
it
reflect
the
figures
of
the
persons
in
the
smaller
studio
.
<EOS>
He
did
this
with
significant
quickness
and
precision
.
<EOS>
It
was
evidently
not
the
first
time
he
had
used
the
glass
for
purposes
of
secret
observation
.
  
<EOS>
Mechanically
stirring
the
wet
plaster
round
and
round
for
the
second
casting
,
the
priest
looked
into
the
glass
,
and
saw
,
as
in
a
picture
,
all
that
was
going
forward
in
the
inner
room
.
<EOS>
Maddalena
Lomi
was
standing
behind
the
young
nobleman
,
watching
the
progress
he
made
with
his
bust
.
<EOS>
Occasionally
she
took
the
modeling
tool
out
of
his
hand
,
and
showed
him
,
with
her
sweetest
smile
,
that
she
,
too
,
as
a
sculptor
's
daughter
,
understood
something
of
the
sculptor
's
art
;
and
now
and
then
,
in
the
pauses
of
the
conversation
,
when
her
interest
was
especially
intense
in
Fabio
's
work
,
she
suffered
her
hand
to
drop
absently
on
his
shoulder
,
or
stooped
forward
so
close
to
him
that
her
hair
mingled
for
a
moment
with
his
.
<EOS>
Moving
the
glass
an
inch
or
two
,
so
as
to
bring
Nanina
well
under
his
eye
,
Father
Rocco
found
that
he
could
trace
each
repetition
of
these
little
acts
of
familiarity
by
the
immediate
effect
which
they
produced
on
the
girl
's
face
and
manner
.
<EOS>
Whenever
Maddalena
so
much
as
touched
the
young
nobleman
 
<EOS>
no
matter
whether
she
did
so
by
premeditation
,
or
really
by
accident
 
<EOS>
Nanina
's
features
contracted
,
her
pale
cheeks
grew
paler
,
she
fidgeted
on
her
chair
,
and
her
fingers
nervously
twisted
and
untwisted
the
loose
ends
of
the
ribbon
fastened
round
her
waist
.
  
<EOS>
"
Jealous
,
"
thought
Father
Rocco
;
"
I
suspected
it
weeks
ago
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
turned
away
,
and
gave
his
whole
attention
for
a
few
minutes
to
the
mixing
of
the
plaster
.
<EOS>
When
he
looked
back
again
at
the
glass
,
he
was
just
in
time
to
witness
a
little
accident
which
suddenly
changed
the
relative
positions
of
the
three
persons
in
the
inner
room
.
  
<EOS>
He
saw
Maddalena
take
up
a
modeling
tool
which
lay
on
a
table
near
her
,
and
begin
to
help
Fabio
in
altering
the
arrangement
of
the
hair
in
his
bust
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
watched
what
she
was
doing
earnestly
enough
for
a
few
moments
;
then
his
attention
wandered
away
to
Nanina
.
<EOS>
She
looked
at
him
reproachfully
,
and
he
answered
by
a
sign
which
brought
a
smile
to
her
face
directly
.
<EOS>
Maddalena
surprised
her
at
the
instant
of
the
change
;
and
,
following
the
direction
of
her
eyes
,
easily
discovered
at
whom
the
smile
was
directed
.
<EOS>
She
darted
a
glance
of
contempt
at
Nanina
,
threw
down
the
modeling
tool
,
and
turned
indignantly
to
the
young
sculptor
,
who
was
affecting
to
be
hard
at
work
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Signor
Fabio
,
"
she
said
,
"
the
next
time
you
forget
what
is
due
to
your
rank
and
yourself
,
warn
me
of
it
,
if
you
please
,
beforehand
,
and
I
will
take
care
to
leave
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
While
speaking
the
last
words
,
she
passed
through
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
bending
abstractedly
over
his
plaster
mixture
,
heard
her
continue
to
herself
in
a
whisper
,
as
she
went
by
him
,
"
If
I
have
any
influence
at
all
with
my
father
,
that
impudent
beggar
-
girl
shall
be
forbidden
the
studio
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Jealousy
on
the
other
side
,
"
thought
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
Something
must
be
done
at
once
,
or
this
will
end
badly
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
again
at
the
glass
,
and
saw
Fabio
,
after
an
instant
of
hesitation
,
beckon
to
Nanina
to
approach
him
.
<EOS>
She
left
her
seat
,
advanced
half
-
way
to
his
,
then
stopped
.
<EOS>
He
stepped
forward
to
meet
her
,
and
,
taking
her
by
the
hand
,
whispered
earnestly
in
her
ear
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
before
dropping
her
hand
,
he
touched
her
cheek
with
his
lips
,
and
then
helped
her
on
with
the
little
white
mantilla
which
covered
her
head
and
shoulders
out
-
of
-
doors
.
<EOS>
The
girl
trembled
violently
,
and
drew
the
linen
close
to
her
face
as
Fabio
walked
into
the
larger
studio
,
and
,
addressing
Father
Rocco
,
said
:
  
"
I
am
afraid
I
am
more
idle
,
or
more
stupid
,
than
ever
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
get
on
with
the
bust
at
all
to
my
satisfaction
,
so
I
have
cut
short
the
sitting
,
and
given
Nanina
a
half
-
holiday
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
first
sound
of
his
voice
,
Maddalena
,
who
was
speaking
to
her
father
,
stopped
,
and
,
with
another
look
of
scorn
at
Nanina
standing
trembling
in
the
doorway
,
left
the
room
.
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
called
Fabio
to
him
as
she
went
away
,
and
Father
Rocco
,
turning
to
the
statuette
,
looked
to
see
how
the
plaster
was
hardening
on
it
.
<EOS>
Seeing
them
thus
engaged
,
Nanina
attempted
to
escape
from
the
studio
without
being
noticed
;
but
the
priest
stopped
her
just
as
she
was
hurrying
by
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
child
,
"
said
he
,
in
his
gentle
,
quiet
way
,
"
are
you
going
home
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
's
heart
beat
too
fast
for
her
to
reply
in
words
;
she
could
only
answer
by
bowing
her
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
Take
this
for
your
little
sister
,
"
pursued
Father
Rocco
,
putting
a
few
silver
coins
in
her
hand
;
"
I
have
got
some
customers
for
those
mats
she
plaits
so
nicely
.
<EOS>
You
need
not
bring
them
to
my
rooms
;
I
will
come
and
see
you
this
evening
,
when
I
am
going
my
rounds
among
my
parishioners
,
and
will
take
the
mats
away
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
good
girl
,
Nanina
 
you
have
always
been
a
good
girl
 
and
as
long
as
I
am
alive
,
my
child
,
you
shall
never
want
a
friend
and
an
adviser
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
's
eyes
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
She
drew
the
mantilla
closer
than
ever
round
her
face
,
as
she
tried
to
thank
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
nodded
to
her
kindly
,
and
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
her
head
for
a
moment
,
then
turned
round
again
to
his
cast
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
forget
my
message
to
the
lady
who
is
to
sit
to
me
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Luca
to
Nanina
,
as
she
passed
him
on
her
way
out
of
the
studio
.
  
<EOS>
After
she
had
gone
,
Fabio
returned
to
the
priest
,
who
was
still
busy
over
his
cast
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
will
get
on
better
with
the
bust
to
-
morrow
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
politely
<EOS>
;
"
I
am
sure
you
can
not
complain
of
your
model
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Complain
of
her
!
"
cried
the
young
man
,
warmly
;
"
she
has
the
most
beautiful
head
I
ever
saw
.
<EOS>
If
I
were
twenty
times
the
sculptor
that
I
am
,
I
should
despair
of
being
able
to
do
her
justice
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
walked
into
the
inner
room
to
look
at
his
bust
again
 
lingered
before
it
for
a
little
while
 
and
then
turned
to
retrace
his
steps
to
the
larger
studio
.
<EOS>
Between
him
<EOS>
and
the
doorway
stood
three
chairs
.
<EOS>
As
he
went
by
them
,
he
absently
touched
the
backs
of
the
 
first
two
,
and
passed
the
third
;
but
just
as
he
was
entering
the
larger
room
,
stopped
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
recollection
,
returned
hastily
,
and
touched
the
third
chair
.
<EOS>
Raising
his
eyes
,
as
he
approached
the
large
studio
again
after
doing
this
,
he
met
the
eyes
of
the
priest
fixed
on
him
in
unconcealed
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Signor
Fabio
!
"
exclaimed
Father
Rocco
,
with
a
sarcastic
smile
,
"
who
would
ever
have
imagined
that
you
were
superstitious
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
nurse
was
,
"
returned
the
young
man
,
reddening
,
and
laughing
rather
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
taught
me
some
bad
habits
that
I
have
not
got
over
yet
.
<EOS>
"
With
those
words
he
nodded
and
hastily
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
Superstitious
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
softly
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
smiled
again
,
reflected
for
a
moment
,
and
then
,
going
to
the
window
,
looked
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
way
to
the
left
led
to
Fabio
's
palace
,
and
the
way
to
the
right
to
the
Campo
Santo
,
in
the
neighborhood
of
which
Nanina
lived
.
<EOS>
The
priest
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
young
sculptor
take
the
way
to
the
right
.
  
<EOS>
After
another
half
-
hour
had
elapsed
,
the
two
workmen
quitted
the
studio
to
go
to
dinner
,
and
Luca
and
his
brother
were
left
alone
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
may
return
now
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
"
to
that
conversation
which
was
suspended
between
us
earlier
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
,
"
rejoined
Luca
,
sulkily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
can
listen
to
me
,
brother
,
with
the
greater
attention
,
"
pursued
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
objected
to
the
coarseness
of
your
tone
in
talking
of
our
young
pupil
and
your
daughter
;
I
object
still
more
strongly
to
your
insinuation
that
my
desire
to
see
them
married
(
provided
always
that
they
are
sincerely
attached
to
each
other
)
springs
from
a
mercenary
motive
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
trying
to
snare
me
,
Rocco
,
in
a
mesh
of
fine
phrases
;
but
I
am
not
to
be
caught
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
my
own
motive
is
for
hoping
that
Maddalena
may
get
an
offer
of
marriage
from
this
wealthy
young
gentleman
 
<EOS>
she
will
have
his
money
,
and
we
shall
all
profit
by
it
.
<EOS>
That
is
coarse
and
mercenary
,
if
you
please
;
but
it
is
the
true
reason
why
I
want
to
see
Maddalena
married
to
Fabio
.
<EOS>
You
want
to
see
it
,
too
 
and
for
what
reason
,
I
should
like
to
know
,
if
not
for
mine
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
what
use
would
wealthy
relations
be
to
me
?
<EOS>
What
are
people
with
money
 
<EOS>
what
is
money
itself
 
to
a
man
who
follows
my
calling
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Money
is
something
to
everybody
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
it
?
<EOS>
When
have
you
found
that
I
have
taken
any
account
of
it
?
<EOS>
Give
me
money
enough
to
buy
my
daily
bread
,
and
to
pay
for
my
lodging
and
my
coarse
cassock
,
and
though
I
may
want
much
for
the
poor
,
for
myself
I
want
no
more
.
<EOS>
Then
have
you
found
me
mercenary
?
<EOS>
Do
I
not
help
you
in
this
studio
,
for
love
of
you
and
of
the
art
,
without
exacting
so
much
as
journeyman
's
wages
?
<EOS>
Have
I
ever
asked
you
for
more
than
a
few
crowns
to
give
away
on
feast
-
days
among
my
parishioners
?
<EOS>
Money
!
<EOS>
money
for
a
man
who
may
be
summoned
to
Rome
to
-
morrow
,
who
may
be
told
to
go
at
half
an
hour
's
notice
on
a
foreign
mission
that
may
take
him
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
who
would
be
ready
to
go
the
moment
when
he
was
called
on
!
<EOS>
Money
to
a
man
who
has
no
wife
,
no
children
,
no
interests
outside
the
sacred
circle
of
the
Church
!
<EOS>
Brother
,
do
you
see
the
dust
and
dirt
and
shapeless
marble
chips
lying
around
your
statue
there
?
<EOS>
Cover
that
floor
instead
with
gold
,
and
,
though
the
litter
may
have
changed
in
color
and
form
,
in
my
eyes
it
would
be
litter
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
noble
sentiment
,
I
dare
say
,
Rocco
,
but
I
ca
n't
echo
it
.
<EOS>
Granting
that
you
care
nothing
for
money
,
will
you
explain
to
me
why
you
are
so
anxious
that
Maddalena
should
marry
Fabio
?
<EOS>
She
has
had
offers
from
poorer
men
 
<EOS>
you
knew
of
them
 
<EOS>
but
you
have
never
taken
the
least
interest
in
her
accepting
or
rejecting
a
proposal
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hinted
the
reason
to
you
,
months
ago
,
when
Fabio
first
entered
the
studio
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
rather
a
vague
hint
,
brother
;
ca
n't
you
be
plainer
to
-
day
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
can
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
let
me
begin
by
assuring
you
that
I
have
no
objection
to
the
young
man
himself
.
<EOS>
He
may
be
a
little
capricious
and
undecided
,
but
he
has
no
incorrigible
faults
that
I
have
discovered
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
rather
a
cool
way
of
praising
him
,
Rocco
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
speak
of
him
warmly
enough
,
if
he
were
not
the
representative
of
an
intolerable
corruption
,
and
a
monstrous
wrong
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
think
of
him
I
think
of
an
injury
which
his
present
existence
perpetuates
;
and
if
I
do
speak
of
him
coldly
,
it
is
only
for
that
reason
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Luca
looked
away
quickly
from
his
brother
,
and
began
kicking
absently
at
the
marble
chips
which
were
scattered
over
the
floor
around
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
now
remember
,
"
he
said
,
"
what
that
hint
of
yours
pointed
at
.
<EOS>
I
know
what
you
mean
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
,
"
answered
the
priest
,
"
that
while
part
of
the
wealth
which
Fabio
d'Ascoli
possesses
is
honestly
and
incontestably
his
own
;
part
,
also
,
has
been
inherited
by
him
from
the
spoilers
and
robbers
of
the
Church
"
  
"
Blame
his
ancestors
for
that
;
do
n't
blame
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
blame
him
as
long
as
the
spoil
is
not
restored
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
it
was
spoil
,
after
all
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
examined
more
carefully
than
most
men
the
records
of
the
civil
wars
in
Italy
;
and
I
know
that
the
ancestors
of
Fabio
d'Ascoli
wrung
from
the
Church
,
in
her
hour
of
weakness
,
property
which
they
dared
to
claim
as
their
right
.
<EOS>
I
know
of
titles
to
lands
signed
away
,
in
those
stormy
times
,
under
the
influence
of
fear
,
or
through
false
representations
of
which
the
law
takes
no
account
.
<EOS>
I
call
the
money
thus
obtained
spoil
,
and
I
say
that
it
ought
to
be
restored
,
and
shall
be
restored
,
to
the
Church
from
which
it
was
taken
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
what
does
Fabio
answer
to
that
,
brother
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
spoken
to
him
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
I
have
,
as
yet
,
no
influence
over
him
.
<EOS>
When
he
is
married
,
his
wife
will
have
influence
over
him
,
and
she
shall
speak
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Maddalena
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
How
do
you
know
that
she
will
speak
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
I
not
educated
her
?
<EOS>
Does
she
not
understand
what
her
duties
are
toward
the
Church
,
in
whose
bosom
she
has
been
reared
?
"
  
<EOS>
Luca
hesitated
uneasily
,
and
walked
away
a
step
or
two
before
he
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
this
spoil
,
<EOS>
as
you
call
it
,
amount
to
a
large
sum
of
money
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
in
an
anxious
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
may
answer
that
question
,
Luca
,
at
some
future
time
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
For
the
present
,
let
it
be
enough
that
you
are
acquainted
with
all
I
undertook
to
inform
you
of
when
we
began
our
conversation
.
<EOS>
You
now
know
that
if
I
am
anxious
for
this
marriage
to
take
place
,
it
is
from
motives
entirely
unconnected
with
self
-
interest
.
<EOS>
If
all
the
property
which
Fabio
's
ancestors
wrongfully
obtained
from
the
Church
were
restored
to
the
Church
to
-
morrow
,
not
one
paulo
of
it
would
go
into
my
pocket
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
poor
priest
now
,
and
to
the
end
of
my
days
shall
remain
so
.
<EOS>
You
soldiers
of
the
world
,
brother
,
fight
for
your
pay
;
I
am
a
soldier
of
the
Church
,
and
I
fight
for
my
cause
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
these
words
,
he
returned
abruptly
to
the
statuette
;
and
refused
to
speak
,
or
leave
his
employment
again
,
until
he
had
taken
the
mold
off
,
and
had
carefully
put
away
the
various
fragments
of
which
it
consisted
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
drew
a
writing
-
desk
from
the
drawer
of
his
working
-
table
,
and
taking
out
a
slip
of
paper
wrote
these
lines
:
  
"
<EOS>
Come
down
to
the
studio
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Fabio
will
be
with
us
,
but
Nanina
will
return
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Without
signing
what
he
had
written
,
he
sealed
it
up
,
and
directed
it
to
"
Donna
Maddalena
"
;
then
took
his
hat
,
and
handed
the
note
to
his
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oblige
me
by
giving
that
to
my
niece
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
,
Rocco
,
"
said
Luca
,
turning
the
note
round
and
round
perplexedly
between
his
finger
and
thumb
;
"
do
you
think
Maddalena
will
be
lucky
enough
to
get
married
to
Fabio
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Still
coarse
in
your
expressions
,
brother
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
mind
my
expressions
.
<EOS>
Is
it
likely
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Luca
,
I
think
it
is
likely
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
he
waved
his
hand
pleasantly
to
his
brother
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
studio
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
went
straight
to
his
own
rooms
,
hard
by
the
church
to
which
he
was
attached
.
<EOS>
Opening
a
cabinet
in
his
study
,
he
took
from
one
of
its
drawers
a
handful
of
small
silver
money
,
consulted
for
a
minute
or
so
a
slate
on
which
several
names
and
addresses
were
written
,
provided
himself
with
a
portable
inkhorn
and
some
strips
of
paper
,
and
again
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
directed
his
steps
to
the
poorest
part
of
the
neighborhood
;
and
entering
some
very
wretched
houses
,
was
greeted
by
the
inhabitants
with
great
respect
and
affection
.
<EOS>
The
women
,
especially
,
kissed
his
hands
with
more
reverence
than
they
would
have
shown
to
the
highest
crowned
head
in
Europe
.
<EOS>
In
return
,
he
talked
to
them
as
easily
and
unconstrainedly
as
if
they
were
his
equals
;
sat
down
cheerfully
on
dirty
bedsides
and
rickety
benches
;
and
distributed
his
little
gifts
of
money
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
was
paying
debts
rather
than
bestowing
charity
.
<EOS>
Where
he
encountered
cases
of
illness
,
he
pulled
out
his
inkhorn
and
slips
of
paper
,
and
wrote
simple
prescriptions
to
be
made
up
from
the
medicine
-
chest
of
a
neighboring
convent
,
which
served
the
same
merciful
purpose
then
that
is
answered
by
dispensaries
in
our
days
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
exhausted
his
money
,
and
had
got
through
his
visits
,
he
was
escorted
out
of
the
poor
quarter
by
a
perfect
train
of
enthusiastic
followers
.
<EOS>
The
women
kissed
his
hand
again
,
and
the
men
uncovered
as
he
turned
,
and
,
with
a
friendly
sign
,
bade
them
all
farewell
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
alone
again
,
he
walked
toward
the
Campo
Santo
,
and
,
passing
the
house
in
which
Nanina
lived
,
sauntered
up
and
down
the
street
thoughtfully
for
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
When
he
at
length
ascended
the
steep
staircase
that
led
to
the
room
occupied
by
the
sisters
,
he
found
the
door
ajar
.
<EOS>
Pushing
it
open
gently
,
he
saw
La
Biondella
sitting
with
her
pretty
,
fair
profile
turned
toward
him
,
eating
her
evening
meal
of
bread
and
grapes
.
<EOS>
At
the
opposite
end
of
the
room
,
Scarammuccia
was
perched
up
on
his
hindquarters
in
a
corner
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
to
catch
the
morsel
of
bread
which
he
evidently
expected
the
child
to
throw
to
him
.
<EOS>
What
the
elder
sister
was
doing
,
the
priest
had
not
time
to
see
;
for
the
dog
barked
the
moment
he
presented
himself
,
and
Nanina
hastened
to
the
door
to
ascertain
who
the
intruder
might
be
.
<EOS>
All
that
he
could
observe
was
that
she
was
too
confused
,
on
catching
sight
of
him
,
to
be
able
to
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
La
Biondella
was
the
first
to
speak
.
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
Father
Rocco
,
"
said
the
child
,
jumping
up
,
with
her
bread
in
one
hand
and
her
grapes
in
the
other
 
"
thank
you
for
giving
me
so
much
money
for
my
dinner
-
mats
.
<EOS>
There
they
are
,
tied
up
together
in
one
little
parcel
,
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
Nanina
said
she
was
ashamed
to
think
of
your
carrying
them
;
and
I
said
I
knew
where
you
lived
,
and
I
should
like
to
ask
you
to
let
me
take
them
home
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
you
can
carry
them
all
the
way
,
my
dear
?
"
asked
the
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Look
,
Father
Rocco
,
see
if
I
ca
n't
carry
them
!
"
<EOS>
cried
La
Biondella
,
cramming
her
bread
into
one
of
the
pockets
of
her
little
apron
,
holding
her
bunch
of
grapes
by
the
stalk
in
her
mouth
,
and
hoisting
the
packet
of
dinner
-
mats
on
her
head
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
See
,
I
am
strong
enough
to
carry
double
,
"
said
the
child
,
looking
up
proudly
into
the
priest
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Can
you
trust
her
to
take
them
home
for
me
?
"
asked
Father
Rocco
,
turning
to
Nanina
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
alone
,
and
her
absence
will
give
me
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Can
you
trust
her
out
by
herself
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
Father
Rocco
,
she
often
goes
out
alone
.
"
<EOS>
Nanina
gave
this
answer
in
low
,
trembling
tones
,
and
looked
down
confusedly
on
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
"
Go
then
,
my
dear
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
patting
the
child
on
the
shoulder
;
"
and
come
back
here
to
your
sister
,
as
soon
as
you
have
left
the
mats
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
La
Biondella
went
out
directly
in
great
triumph
,
with
Scarammuccia
walking
by
her
side
,
and
keeping
his
muzzle
suspiciously
close
to
the
pocket
in
which
she
had
put
her
bread
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
closed
the
door
after
them
,
and
then
,
taking
the
one
chair
which
the
room
possessed
,
motioned
to
Nanina
to
sit
by
him
on
the
stool
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
believe
that
I
am
your
friend
,
my
child
,
and
that
I
have
always
meant
well
toward
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
began
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
best
and
kindest
of
friends
,
"
answered
Nanina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
will
hear
what
I
have
to
say
patiently
,
and
you
will
believe
that
I
am
speaking
for
your
good
,
even
if
my
words
should
distress
you
?
"
<EOS>
(
Nanina
turned
away
her
head
.
)
<EOS>
"
Now
,
tell
me
;
should
I
be
wrong
,
to
begin
with
,
if
I
said
that
my
brother
's
pupil
,
the
young
nobleman
whom
we
call
"
Signor
Fabio
,
"
had
been
here
to
see
you
to
-
day
?
"
<EOS>
(
Nanina
started
up
affrightedly
from
her
stool
.
)
<EOS>
"
Sit
down
again
,
my
child
;
I
am
not
going
to
blame
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
only
going
to
tell
you
what
you
must
do
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
;
it
was
cold
,
and
it
trembled
violently
in
his
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
what
he
has
been
saying
to
you
,
"
continued
the
priest
;
"
for
it
might
distress
you
to
answer
,
and
I
have
,
moreover
,
had
means
of
knowing
that
your
youth
and
beauty
have
made
a
strong
impression
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
pass
over
,
then
,
all
reference
to
the
words
he
may
have
been
speaking
to
you
;
and
I
will
come
at
once
to
what
I
have
now
to
say
,
in
my
turn
.
<EOS>
Nanina
,
my
child
,
arm
yourself
with
all
your
courage
,
and
promise
me
,
before
we
part
to
-
night
,
that
you
will
see
Signor
Fabio
no
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
turned
round
suddenly
,
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
,
with
an
expression
of
terrified
incredulity
.
<EOS>
"
No
more
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
very
young
and
very
innocent
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
;
"
but
surely
you
must
have
thought
before
now
of
the
difference
between
Signor
Fabio
and
you
.
<EOS>
Surely
you
must
have
often
remembered
that
you
are
low
down
among
the
ranks
of
the
poor
,
and
that
he
is
high
up
among
the
rich
and
the
nobly
born
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
's
hands
dropped
on
the
priest
's
knees
.
<EOS>
She
bent
her
head
down
on
them
,
and
began
to
weep
bitterly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Surely
you
must
have
thought
of
that
?
"
reiterated
Father
Rocco
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
I
have
often
,
often
thought
of
it
!
"
<EOS>
murmured
the
girl
<EOS>
"
I
have
mourned
over
it
,
and
cried
about
it
in
secret
for
many
nights
past
.
<EOS>
He
said
I
looked
pale
,
and
ill
,
and
out
of
spirits
to
-
day
,
and
I
told
him
it
was
with
thinking
of
that
!
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
what
did
he
say
in
return
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
looked
down
.
<EOS>
Nanina
raised
her
head
directly
from
his
knees
,
and
tried
to
turn
it
away
again
.
<EOS>
He
took
her
hand
and
stopped
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
;
"
speak
frankly
to
me
.
<EOS>
Say
what
you
ought
to
say
to
your
father
and
your
friend
.
<EOS>
What
was
his
answer
,
my
child
,
when
you
reminded
him
of
the
difference
between
you
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
said
I
was
born
to
be
a
lady
,
"
faltered
the
girl
,
still
struggling
to
turn
her
face
away
,
"
and
that
I
might
make
myself
one
if
I
would
learn
and
be
patient
.
<EOS>
He
said
that
if
he
had
all
the
noble
ladies
in
Pisa
to
choose
from
on
one
side
,
and
only
little
Nanina
on
the
other
,
he
would
hold
out
his
hand
to
me
,
and
tell
them
,
"
This
shall
be
my
wife
.
"
<EOS>
He
said
love
knew
no
difference
of
rank
;
and
that
if
he
was
a
nobleman
and
rich
,
it
was
all
the
more
reason
why
he
should
please
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
kind
,
that
I
thought
my
heart
would
burst
while
he
was
speaking
;
and
my
little
sister
liked
him
so
,
that
she
got
upon
his
knee
and
kissed
him
.
<EOS>
Even
our
dog
,
who
growls
at
other
strangers
,
stole
to
his
side
and
licked
his
hand
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Father
Rocco
!
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
tears
burst
out
afresh
,
and
the
lovely
head
dropped
once
more
,
wearily
,
on
the
priest
's
knee
.
  
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
smiled
to
himself
,
and
waited
to
speak
again
till
she
was
calmer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Supposing
,
"
he
resumed
,
after
some
minutes
of
silence
,
"
supposing
Signor
Fabio
really
meant
all
he
said
to
you
"
  
Nanina
started
up
,
and
confronted
the
priest
boldly
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
entered
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Supposing
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
her
cheeks
beginning
to
redden
,
and
her
dark
blue
eyes
flashing
suddenly
through
her
tears
"
Supposing
!
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
Fabio
would
never
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
I
would
die
here
at
your
feet
,
rather
than
doubt
the
least
word
he
said
to
me
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
priest
signed
to
her
quietly
to
return
to
the
stool
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
suspected
the
child
had
so
much
spirit
in
her
,
"
he
thought
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
die
,
"
repeated
Nanina
,
in
a
voice
that
began
to
falter
now
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
die
rather
than
doubt
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
ask
you
to
doubt
him
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
gently
;
"
and
I
will
believe
in
him
myself
as
firmly
as
you
do
.
<EOS>
Let
us
suppose
,
my
child
,
that
you
have
learned
patiently
all
the
many
things
of
which
you
are
now
ignorant
,
and
which
it
is
necessary
for
a
lady
to
know
.
<EOS>
Let
us
suppose
that
Signor
Fabio
has
really
violated
all
the
laws
that
govern
people
in
his
high
station
and
has
taken
you
to
him
publicly
as
his
wife
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
happy
then
,
Nanina
;
but
would
he
?
<EOS>
He
has
no
father
or
mother
to
control
him
,
it
is
true
;
but
he
has
friends
 
many
friends
and
intimates
in
his
own
rank
 
proud
,
heartless
people
,
who
know
nothing
of
your
worth
and
goodness
;
who
,
hearing
of
your
low
birth
,
would
look
on
you
,
and
on
your
husband
too
,
my
child
,
with
contempt
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
your
patience
and
fortitude
.
<EOS>
Think
how
bitter
it
would
be
for
him
to
bear
that
contempt
 
to
see
you
shunned
by
proud
women
,
and
carelessly
pitied
or
patronized
by
insolent
men
.
<EOS>
Yet
all
this
,
and
more
,
he
would
have
to
endure
,
or
else
to
quit
the
world
he
has
lived
in
from
his
boyhood
 
the
world
he
was
born
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
You
love
him
,
I
know
"
  
Nanina
's
tears
burst
out
afresh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
how
dearly
 
how
dearly
!
"
<EOS>
she
murmured
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
you
love
him
dearly
,
"
continued
the
priest
;
"
but
would
all
your
love
compensate
him
for
everything
else
that
he
must
lose
?
<EOS>
It
might
,
at
first
;
but
there
would
come
a
time
when
the
world
would
assert
its
influence
over
him
again
;
when
he
would
feel
a
want
which
you
could
not
supply
 
a
weariness
which
you
could
not
solace
.
<EOS>
Think
of
his
life
then
,
and
of
yours
.
<EOS>
Think
of
the
first
day
when
the
first
secret
doubt
whether
he
had
done
rightly
in
marrying
you
would
steal
into
his
mind
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
masters
of
all
our
impulses
.
<EOS>
The
lightest
spirits
have
their
moments
of
irresistible
depression
;
the
bravest
hearts
are
not
always
superior
to
doubt
.
<EOS>
My
child
,
my
child
,
the
world
is
strong
,
the
pride
of
rank
is
rooted
deep
,
and
the
human
will
is
frail
at
best
!
<EOS>
Be
warned
!
<EOS>
For
your
own
sake
and
for
Fabio
's
,
be
warned
in
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
stretched
out
her
hands
toward
the
priest
in
despair
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
Father
Rocco
!
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
why
did
you
not
tell
me
this
before
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
my
child
,
I
only
knew
of
the
necessity
for
telling
you
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
too
late
;
it
is
never
too
late
to
do
a
good
action
.
<EOS>
You
love
Fabio
,
Nanina
?
<EOS>
Will
you
prove
that
love
by
making
a
great
sacrifice
for
his
good
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
would
die
for
his
good
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Will
you
nobly
cure
him
of
a
passion
which
will
be
his
ruin
,
if
not
yours
,
by
leaving
Pisa
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Leave
Pisa
!
"
exclaimed
Nanina
.
<EOS>
Her
face
grew
deadly
pale
;
she
rose
and
moved
back
a
step
or
two
from
the
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Listen
to
me
,
"
pursued
Father
Rocco
;
"
I
have
heard
you
complain
that
you
could
not
get
regular
employment
at
needle
-
work
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
that
employment
,
if
you
will
go
with
me
 
you
and
your
little
sister
too
,
of
course
 
to
Florence
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
promised
Fabio
to
go
to
the
studio
,
"
began
Nanina
,
affrightedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
promised
to
go
at
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
"
  
She
stopped
suddenly
,
as
if
her
breath
were
failing
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
myself
will
take
you
and
your
sister
to
Florence
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
without
noticing
the
interruption
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
place
you
under
the
care
of
a
lady
who
will
be
as
kind
as
a
mother
to
you
both
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
your
getting
such
work
to
do
as
will
enable
you
to
keep
yourself
honestly
and
independently
;
and
I
will
undertake
,
if
you
do
not
like
your
life
at
Florence
,
to
bring
you
back
to
Pisa
after
a
lapse
of
three
months
only
.
<EOS>
Three
months
,
Nanina
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
a
long
exile
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fabio
!
Fabio
!
"
cried
the
girl
,
sinking
again
on
the
seat
,
and
hiding
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
for
his
good
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
calmly
:
"
for
Fabio
's
good
,
remember
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
would
he
think
of
me
if
I
went
away
?
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
I
had
but
learned
to
write
!
<EOS>
If
I
could
only
write
Fabio
a
letter
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
not
to
be
depended
on
to
explain
to
him
all
that
he
ought
to
know
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
can
I
go
away
from
him
!
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
how
can
you
ask
me
to
go
away
from
him
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
ask
you
to
do
nothing
hastily
.
<EOS>
I
will
leave
you
till
to
-
morrow
morning
to
decide
.
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
I
shall
be
in
the
street
;
and
I
will
not
even
so
much
as
enter
this
house
,
unless
I
know
beforehand
that
you
have
resolved
to
follow
my
advice
.
<EOS>
Give
me
a
sign
from
your
window
.
<EOS>
If
I
see
you
wave
your
white
mantilla
out
of
it
,
I
shall
know
that
you
have
taken
the
noble
resolution
to
save
Fabio
and
to
save
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
will
say
no
more
,
my
child
;
for
,
unless
I
am
grievously
mistaken
in
you
,
I
have
already
said
enough
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
went
out
,
leaving
her
still
weeping
bitterly
.
<EOS>
Not
far
from
the
house
,
he
met
La
Biondella
and
the
dog
on
their
way
back
.
<EOS>
The
little
girl
stopped
to
report
to
him
the
safe
delivery
of
her
dinner
-
mats
;
but
he
passed
on
quickly
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
.
<EOS>
His
interview
with
Nanina
had
left
some
influence
behind
it
,
which
unfitted
him
just
then
for
the
occupation
of
talking
to
a
child
.
  
<EOS>
Nearly
half
an
hour
before
nine
o'clock
on
the
following
morning
,
Father
Rocco
set
forth
for
the
street
in
which
Nanina
lived
.
<EOS>
On
his
way
thither
he
overtook
a
dog
walking
lazily
a
few
paces
ahead
in
the
roadway
;
and
saw
,
at
the
same
time
,
an
elegantly
-
dressed
lady
advancing
toward
him
.
<EOS>
The
dog
stopped
suspiciously
as
she
approached
,
and
growled
and
showed
his
teeth
when
she
passed
him
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
on
her
side
,
uttered
an
exclamation
of
disgust
,
but
did
not
seem
to
be
either
astonished
or
frightened
by
the
animal
's
threatening
attitude
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
looked
after
her
with
some
curiosity
as
she
walked
by
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
handsome
woman
,
and
he
admired
her
courage
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
that
growling
brute
well
enough
,
"
he
said
to
himself
,
"
but
who
can
the
lady
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
dog
was
Scarammuccia
,
returning
from
one
of
his
marauding
expeditions
The
lady
was
Brigida
,
on
her
way
to
Luca
Lomi
's
studio
.
  
<EOS>
Some
minutes
before
nine
o'clock
the
priest
took
his
post
in
the
street
,
opposite
Nanina
's
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
open
;
but
neither
she
nor
her
little
sister
appeared
at
it
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
anxiously
as
the
church
-
clocks
struck
the
hour
;
but
there
was
no
sign
for
a
minute
or
so
after
they
were
all
silent
.
<EOS>
"
Is
she
hesitating
still
?
"
said
Father
Rocco
to
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
the
words
passed
his
lips
,
the
white
mantilla
was
waved
out
of
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
PART
SECOND
.
  
<EOS>
.
  
<EOS>
Even
the
master
-
stroke
of
replacing
the
treacherous
Italian
forewoman
by
a
French
dressmaker
,
engaged
direct
from
Paris
,
did
not
at
first
avail
to
elevate
the
great
Grifoni
establishment
above
the
reach
of
minor
calamities
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
had
not
occupied
her
new
situation
at
Pisa
quite
a
week
before
she
fell
ill
.
<EOS>
All
sorts
of
reports
were
circulated
as
to
the
cause
of
this
illness
;
and
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
even
went
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
the
health
of
the
new
forewoman
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
some
nefarious
practices
of
the
chemical
sort
,
on
the
part
of
her
rival
in
the
trade
.
<EOS>
But
,
however
the
misfortune
had
been
produced
,
it
was
a
fact
that
Mademoiselle
Virginie
was
certainly
very
ill
,
and
another
fact
that
the
doctor
insisted
on
her
being
sent
to
the
baths
of
Lucca
as
soon
as
she
could
be
moved
from
her
bed
.
  
<EOS>
Fortunately
for
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
,
the
Frenchwoman
had
succeeded
in
producing
three
specimens
of
her
art
before
her
health
broke
down
.
<EOS>
They
comprised
the
evening
-
dress
of
yellow
brocaded
silk
,
to
which
she
had
devoted
herself
on
the
morning
when
she
first
assumed
her
duties
at
Pisa
;
a
black
cloak
and
hood
of
an
entirely
new
shape
;
and
an
irresistibly
fascinating
dressing
-
gown
,
said
to
have
been
first
brought
into
fashion
by
the
princesses
of
the
blood
-
royal
of
France
.
<EOS>
These
articles
of
costume
,
on
being
exhibited
in
the
showroom
,
electrified
the
ladies
of
Pisa
;
and
orders
from
all
sides
flowed
in
immediately
on
the
Grifoni
establishment
.
<EOS>
They
were
,
of
course
,
easily
executed
by
the
inferior
work
-
women
,
from
the
specimen
designs
of
the
French
dressmaker
.
<EOS>
So
that
the
illness
of
Mademoiselle
Virginie
,
though
it
might
cause
her
mistress
some
temporary
inconvenience
,
was
,
after
all
,
productive
of
no
absolute
loss
.
  
<EOS>
Two
months
at
the
baths
of
Lucca
restored
the
new
forewoman
to
health
.
<EOS>
She
returned
to
Pisa
,
and
resumed
her
place
in
the
private
work
-
room
.
<EOS>
Once
re
-
established
there
,
she
discovered
that
an
important
change
had
taken
place
during
her
absence
.
<EOS>
Her
friend
and
assistant
,
Brigida
,
had
resigned
her
situation
.
<EOS>
All
inquiries
made
of
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
only
elicited
one
answer
:
the
missing
work
-
woman
had
abruptly
left
her
place
at
five
minutes
'
warning
,
and
had
departed
without
confiding
to
any
one
what
she
thought
of
doing
,
or
whither
she
intended
to
turn
her
steps
.
  
<EOS>
Months
elapsed
The
new
year
came
;
but
no
explanatory
letter
arrived
from
Brigida
.
<EOS>
The
spring
season
passed
off
,
with
all
its
accompaniments
of
dressmaking
and
dress
-
buying
,
but
still
there
was
no
news
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
first
anniversary
of
Mademoiselle
Virginie
's
engagement
with
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
came
round
;
and
then
at
last
a
note
arrived
,
stating
that
Brigida
had
returned
to
Pisa
,
and
that
if
the
French
forewoman
would
send
an
answer
,
mentioning
where
her
private
lodgings
were
,
she
would
visit
her
old
friend
that
evening
after
business
hours
.
<EOS>
The
information
was
gladly
enough
given
;
and
,
punctually
to
the
appointed
time
,
Brigida
arrived
in
Mademoiselle
Virginie
's
little
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Advancing
with
her
usual
indolent
stateliness
of
gait
,
the
Italian
asked
after
her
friend
's
health
as
coolly
,
and
sat
down
in
the
nearest
chair
as
carelessly
,
as
if
they
had
not
been
separated
for
more
than
a
few
days
.
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
laughed
in
her
liveliest
manner
,
and
raised
her
mobile
French
eyebrows
in
sprightly
astonishment
.
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
Brigida
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
"
they
certainly
did
you
no
injustice
when
they
nicknamed
you
"
Care
-
for
-
Nothing
,
"
in
old
Grifoni
's
workroom
.
<EOS>
Where
have
you
been
?
<EOS>
Why
have
you
never
written
to
me
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
nothing
particular
to
write
about
;
and
besides
,
I
always
intended
to
come
back
to
Pisa
and
see
you
,
"
answered
Brigida
,
leaning
back
luxuriously
in
her
chair
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
where
have
you
been
for
nearly
a
whole
year
past
?
<EOS>
In
Italy
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
You
know
I
can
sing
 
not
very
well
;
but
I
have
a
voice
,
and
most
Frenchwomen
(
excuse
the
impertinence
)
have
none
.
<EOS>
I
met
with
a
friend
,
and
got
introduced
to
a
manager
;
and
I
have
been
singing
at
the
theater
 
not
the
great
parts
,
only
the
second
.
<EOS>
Your
amiable
countrywomen
could
not
screech
me
down
on
the
stage
,
but
they
intrigued
against
me
successfully
behind
the
scenes
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
quarreled
with
our
principal
lady
,
quarreled
with
the
manager
,
quarreled
with
my
friend
;
and
here
I
am
back
at
Pisa
,
with
a
little
money
saved
in
my
pocket
,
and
no
great
notion
what
I
am
to
do
next
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
Back
at
Pisa
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
leave
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Brigida
's
eyes
began
to
lose
their
indolent
expression
.
<EOS>
She
sat
up
suddenly
in
her
chair
,
and
set
one
of
her
hands
heavily
on
a
little
table
by
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
she
repeated
.
<EOS>
"
Because
when
I
find
the
game
going
against
me
,
I
prefer
giving
it
up
at
once
to
waiting
to
be
beaten
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
refer
to
that
last
year
's
project
of
yours
for
making
your
fortune
among
the
sculptors
.
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
hear
how
it
was
you
failed
with
the
wealthy
young
amateur
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
I
fell
ill
before
you
had
any
news
to
give
me

Your
absence
when
I
returned
from
Lucca
,
and
,
almost
immediately
afterward
,
the
marriage
of
your
intended
conquest
to
the
sculptor
's
daughter
,
proved
to
me
,
of
course
,
that
you
must
have
failed
.
<EOS>
But
I
never
heard
how
.
<EOS>
I
know
nothing
at
this
moment
but
the
bare
fact
that
Maddalena
Lomi
won
the
prize
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
first
,
do
she
and
her
husband
live
together
happily
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
There
are
no
stories
of
their
disagreeing
.
<EOS>
She
has
dresses
,
horses
,
carriages
;
a
negro
page
,
the
smallest
lap
-
dog
in
Italy
 
in
short
,
all
the
luxuries
that
a
woman
can
want
;
and
a
child
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
into
the
bargain
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
child
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
a
child
,
born
little
more
than
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Not
a
boy
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
a
girl
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
Those
rich
people
always
want
the
first
-
born
to
be
an
heir
.
<EOS>
They
will
both
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Mercy
on
us
,
Brigida
,
how
fierce
you
look
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
I
?
<EOS>
It
's
likely
enough
.
<EOS>
I
hate
Fabio
d'Ascoli
and
Maddalena
Lomi
 
singly
as
man
and
woman
,
doubly
as
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
I
'll
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
directly
.
<EOS>
Only
answer
me
another
question
or
two
first
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
anything
about
her
health
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
should
I
hear
?
<EOS>
Dressmakers
ca
n't
inquire
at
the
doors
of
the
nobility
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
<EOS>
Now
one
last
question
.
<EOS>
That
little
simpleton
,
Nanina
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
never
seen
or
heard
anything
of
her
.
<EOS>
She
ca
n't
be
at
Pisa
,
or
she
would
have
called
at
our
place
for
work
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
need
not
have
asked
about
her
if
I
had
thought
a
moment
beforehand
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
would
be
sure
to
keep
her
out
of
Fabio
's
sight
,
for
his
niece
's
sake
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
,
he
really
loved
that
"
thread
-
paper
of
a
girl
"
as
you
called
her
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Better
than
fifty
such
wives
as
he
has
got
now
!
<EOS>
I
was
in
the
studio
<EOS>
the
morning
he
was
told
of
her
departure
from
Pisa
.
<EOS>
A
letter
was
privately
given
to
him
,
telling
him
that
the
girl
had
left
the
place
out
of
a
feeling
of
honor
,
and
had
hidden
herself
beyond
the
possibility
of
discovery
,
to
prevent
him
from
compromising
himself
with
all
his
friends
by
marrying
her
.
<EOS>
Naturally
enough
,
he
would
not
believe
that
this
was
her
own
doing
;
and
,
naturally
enough
also
,
when
Father
Rocco
was
sent
for
,
and
was
not
to
be
found
,
he
suspected
the
priest
of
being
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
.
<EOS>
I
never
saw
a
man
in
such
a
fury
of
despair
and
rage
before
.
<EOS>
He
swore
that
he
would
have
all
Italy
searched
for
the
girl
,
that
he
would
be
the
death
of
the
priest
,
and
that
he
would
never
enter
Luca
Lomi
's
studio
again
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
,
as
to
this
last
particular
,
of
course
,
being
a
man
,
he
failed
to
keep
his
word
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Of
course
.
<EOS>
At
that
first
visit
of
mine
to
the
studio
I
discovered
two
things
.
<EOS>
The
first
,
as
I
said
,
that
Fabio
was
really
in
love
with
the
girl
 
<EOS>
the
second
,
that
Maddalena
Lomi
was
really
in
love
with
him
.
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
I
looked
at
her
attentively
while
the
disturbance
was
going
on
,
and
while
nobody
's
notice
was
directed
on
me
.
<EOS>
All
women
are
vain
,
I
know
,
but
vanity
never
blinded
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
I
saw
directly
that
I
had
but
one
superiority
over
her
 
my
figure
.
<EOS>
She
was
my
height
,
but
not
well
made
.
<EOS>
She
had
hair
as
dark
and
as
glossy
as
mine
;
eyes
as
bright
and
as
black
as
mine
;
and
the
rest
of
her
face
better
than
mine
.
<EOS>
My
nose
is
coarse
,
my
lips
are
too
thick
,
and
my
upper
lip
overhangs
my
under
too
far
.
<EOS>
She
had
none
of
those
personal
faults
;
and
,
as
for
capacity
,
she
managed
the
young
fool
in
his
passion
as
well
as
I
could
have
managed
him
in
her
place
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
stood
silent
,
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
distressed
look
,
all
the
time
he
was
raving
up
and
down
the
studio
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
hated
the
girl
,
and
been
rejoiced
at
her
disappearance
;
but
she
never
showed
it
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
be
an
awkward
rival
"
<EOS>
(
I
thought
to
myself
)
,
"
even
to
a
handsomer
woman
than
I
am
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
determined
not
to
despair
too
soon
,
and
made
up
my
mind
to
follow
my
plan
just
as
if
the
accident
of
the
girl
's
disappearance
had
never
occurred
.
<EOS>
I
smoothed
down
the
master
-
sculptor
easily
enough
 
<EOS>
flattering
him
about
his
reputation
,
assuring
him
that
the
works
of
Luca
Lomi
had
been
the
objects
of
my
adoration
since
childhood
,
telling
him
that
I
had
heard
of
his
difficulty
in
finding
a
model
to
complete
his
Minerva
from
,
and
offering
myself
(
if
he
thought
me
worthy
)
for
the
honor
 
laying
great
stress
on
that
word
 
for
the
honor
of
sitting
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
he
was
altogether
deceived
by
what
I
told
him
;
but
he
was
sharp
enough
to
see
that
I
really
could
be
of
use
,
and
he
accepted
my
offer
with
a
profusion
of
compliments
.
<EOS>
We
parted
,
having
arranged
that
I
was
to
give
him
a
first
sitting
in
a
week
's
time
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Why
put
it
off
so
long
?
"
  
"
To
allow
our
young
gentleman
time
to
cool
down
and
return
to
the
studio
,
to
be
sure
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
use
of
my
being
there
while
he
was
away
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
 
I
forgot
.
<EOS>
And
how
long
was
it
before
he
came
back
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
allowed
him
more
time
than
enough
.
<EOS>
When
I
had
given
my
first
sitting
I
saw
him
in
the
studio
,
and
heard
it
was
his
second
visit
there
since
the
day
of
the
girl
's
disappearance
.
<EOS>
Those
very
violent
men
are
always
changeable
and
irresolute
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Had
he
made
no
attempt
,
then
,
to
discover
Nanina
?
"
  
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
yes
!
<EOS>
He
had
searched
for
her
himself
,
and
had
set
others
searching
for
her
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
Four
days
of
perpetual
disappointment
had
been
enough
to
bring
him
to
his
senses
.
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
had
written
him
a
peace
-
making
letter
,
asking
what
harm
he
or
his
daughter
had
done
,
even
supposing
Father
Rocco
was
to
blame
.
<EOS>
Maddalena
Lomi
had
met
him
in
the
street
,
and
had
looked
resignedly
away
from
him
,
as
if
she
expected
him
to
pass
her
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
had
awakened
his
sense
of
justice
and
his
good
nature
(
you
see
,
I
can
impartially
give
him
his
due
)
,
and
they
had
got
him
back
.
<EOS>
He
was
silent
and
sentimental
enough
at
first
,
and
shockingly
sulky
and
savage
with
the
priest
"
  
"
I
wonder
Father
Rocco
ventured
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
Rocco
is
not
a
man
to
be
daunted
or
defeated
by
anybody
,
I
can
tell
you
.
<EOS>
The
same
day
on
which
Fabio
came
back
to
the
studio
,
he
returned
to
it
.
<EOS>
Beyond
boldly
declaring
that
he
thought
Nanina
had
done
quite
right
,
and
had
acted
like
a
good
and
virtuous
girl
,
he
would
say
nothing
about
her
or
her
disappearance
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
useless
to
ask
him
questions
 
he
denied
that
any
one
had
a
right
to
put
them
.
<EOS>
Threatening
,
entreating
,
flattering
 
<EOS>
all
modes
of
appeal
were
thrown
away
on
him
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
my
dear
!
depend
upon
it
,
the
cleverest
and
politest
man
in
Pisa
,
the
most
dangerous
to
an
enemy
and
the
most
delightful
to
a
friend
,
is
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
them
,
when
I
began
to
play
my
cards
a
little
too
openly
,
behaved
with
brutal
rudeness
to
me
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
from
first
to
last
,
treated
me
like
a
lady
.
<EOS>
Sincere
or
not
,
I
do
n't
care
 
<EOS>
he
treated
me
like
a
lady
when
the
others
treated
me
like
"
  
"
There
!
<EOS>
there
!
<EOS>
do
n't
get
hot
about
it
now
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
instead
how
you
made
your
first
approaches
to
the
young
gentleman
whom
you
talk
of
so
contemptuously
as
Fabio
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
it
turned
out
,
in
the
worst
possible
way
.
<EOS>
First
,
of
course
,
I
made
sure
of
interesting
him
in
me
by
telling
him
that
I
had
known
Nanina
.
<EOS>
So
far
it
was
all
well
enough
.
<EOS>
My
next
object
was
to
persuade
him
that
she
could
never
have
gone
away
if
she
had
truly
loved
him
alone
;
and
that
he
must
have
had
some
fortunate
rival
in
her
own
rank
of
life
,
to
whom
she
had
sacrificed
him
,
after
gratifying
her
vanity
for
a
time
by
bringing
a
young
nobleman
to
her
feet
.
<EOS>
I
had
,
as
you
will
easily
imagine
,
difficulty
enough
in
making
him
take
this
view
of
Nanina
's
flight
.
<EOS>
His
pride
and
his
love
for
the
girl
were
both
concerned
in
refusing
to
admit
the
truth
of
my
suggestion
.
<EOS>
At
last
I
succeeded
.
<EOS>
I
brought
him
to
that
state
of
ruffled
vanity
and
fretful
self
-
assertion
in
which
it
is
easiest
to
work
on
a
man
's
feelings
 
in
which
a
man
's
own
wounded
pride
makes
the
best
pitfall
to
catch
him
in
.
<EOS>
I
brought
him
,
I
say
,
to
that
state
,
and
then
she
stepped
in
and
profited
by
what
I
had
done
.
<EOS>
Is
it
wonderful
now
that
I
rejoice
in
her
disappointments
 
that
I
should
be
glad
to
hear
any
ill
thing
of
her
that
any
one
could
tell
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
how
did
she
first
get
the
advantage
of
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
found
out
,
she
would
never
have
succeeded
where
I
failed
.
<EOS>
All
I
know
is
,
that
she
had
more
opportunities
of
seeing
him
than
I
,
and
that
she
used
them
cunningly
enough
even
to
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
While
I
thought
I
was
gaining
ground
with
Fabio
,
I
was
actually
losing
it
.
<EOS>
My
first
suspicions
were
excited
by
a
change
in
Luca
Lomi
's
conduct
toward
me
.
<EOS>
He
grew
cold
,
neglectful
 
at
last
absolutely
rude
.
<EOS>
I
was
resolved
not
to
see
this
;
but
accident
soon
obliged
me
to
open
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
One
morning
I
heard
Fabio
and
Maddalena
talking
of
me
when
they
imagined
I
had
left
the
studio
.
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
repeat
their
words
,
especially
here
.
<EOS>
The
blood
flies
into
my
head
,
and
the
cold
catches
me
at
the
heart
,
when
I
only
think
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
enough
if
I
tell
you
that
he
laughed
at
me
,
and
that
she
"
  
"
Hush
!
<EOS>
not
so
loud
.
<EOS>
There
are
other
people
lodging
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Never
mind
about
telling
me
what
you
heard
;
it
only
irritates
you
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
can
guess
that
they
had
discovered
"
  
"
<EOS>
Through
her
 
remember
,
all
through
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
They
had
discovered
a
great
deal
more
than
you
ever
intended
them
to
know
,
and
all
through
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
But
for
the
priest
,
Virginie
,
I
should
have
been
openly
insulted
and
driven
from
their
doors
.
<EOS>
He
had
insisted
on
their
behaving
with
decent
civility
toward
me
.
<EOS>
They
said
that
he
was
afraid
of
me
,
and
laughed
at
the
notion
of
his
trying
to
make
them
afraid
too
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
last
thing
I
heard
.
<EOS>
The
fury
I
was
in
,
and
the
necessity
of
keeping
it
down
,
almost
suffocated
me
.
<EOS>
I
turned
round
to
leave
the
place
forever
,
when
,
who
should
I
see
,
standing
close
behind
me
,
but
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
He
must
have
discovered
in
my
face
that
I
knew
all
,
but
he
took
no
notice
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
only
asked
,
in
his
usual
quiet
,
polite
way
,
if
I
was
looking
for
anything
I
had
lost
,
and
if
he
could
help
me
.
<EOS>
I
managed
to
thank
him
,
and
to
get
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
opened
it
for
me
respectfully
,
and
bowed
 
he
treated
me
like
a
lady
to
the
last
!
<EOS>
It
was
evening
when
I
left
the
studio
in
that
way
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
I
threw
up
my
situation
,
and
turned
my
back
on
Pisa
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
of
the
marriage
?
<EOS>
or
did
you
only
assume
from
what
you
knew
that
it
would
take
place
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
it
about
six
months
ago
.
<EOS>
A
man
came
to
sing
in
the
chorus
at
our
theater
who
had
been
employed
some
time
before
at
the
grand
concert
given
on
the
occasion
of
the
marriage
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
drop
the
subject
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
a
fever
already
with
talking
of
it
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
a
bad
situation
here
,
my
dear
;
I
declare
your
room
is
almost
stifling
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Shall
I
open
the
other
window
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
let
us
go
out
and
get
a
breath
of
air
by
the
river
-
side
.
<EOS>
Come
!
<EOS>
take
your
hood
and
fan
 
<EOS>
it
is
getting
dark
 
nobody
will
see
us
,
and
we
can
come
back
here
,
if
you
like
,
in
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
acceded
to
her
friend
's
wish
rather
reluctantly
.
<EOS>
They
walked
toward
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
down
,
and
the
sudden
night
of
Italy
was
gathering
fast
.
<EOS>
Although
Brigida
did
not
say
another
word
on
the
subject
of
Fabio
or
his
wife
,
she
led
the
way
to
the
bank
of
the
Arno
,
on
which
the
young
nobleman
's
palace
stood
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
they
got
near
the
great
door
of
entrance
,
a
sedan
-
chair
,
approaching
in
the
opposite
direction
,
was
set
down
before
it
;
and
a
footman
,
after
a
moment
's
conference
with
a
lady
inside
the
chair
,
advanced
to
the
porter
's
lodge
in
the
courtyard
.
<EOS>
Leaving
her
friend
to
go
on
,
Brigida
slipped
in
after
the
servant
by
the
open
wicket
,
and
concealed
herself
in
the
shadow
cast
by
the
great
closed
gates
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Marchesa
Melani
,
to
inquire
how
the
Countess
d'Ascoli
and
the
infant
are
this
evening
,
"
said
the
footman
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
has
not
changed
at
all
for
the
better
since
the
morning
,
"
answered
the
porter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
child
is
doing
quite
well
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
footman
went
back
to
the
sedan
-
chair
;
then
returned
to
the
porter
's
lodge
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
marchesa
desires
me
to
ask
if
fresh
medical
advice
has
been
sent
for
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Another
doctor
has
arrived
from
Florence
to
-
day
,
"
replied
the
porter
.
  
<EOS>
Mademoiselle
Virginie
,
missing
her
friend
suddenly
,
turned
back
toward
the
palace
to
look
after
her
,
and
was
rather
surprised
to
see
Brigida
slip
out
of
the
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
oil
lamps
burning
on
pillars
outside
the
doorway
,
and
their
light
glancing
on
the
Italian
's
face
,
as
she
passed
under
them
,
showed
that
she
was
smiling
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
Marchesa
Melani
was
making
inquiries
at
the
gate
of
the
palace
,
Fabio
was
sitting
alone
in
the
apartment
which
his
wife
usually
occupied
when
she
was
in
health
.
<EOS>
It
was
her
favorite
room
,
and
had
been
prettily
decorated
,
by
her
own
desire
,
with
hangings
in
yellow
satin
and
furniture
of
the
same
color
.
<EOS>
Fabio
was
now
waiting
in
it
,
to
hear
the
report
of
the
doctors
after
their
evening
visit
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Maddalena
Lomi
had
not
been
his
first
love
,
and
although
he
had
married
her
under
circumstances
which
are
generally
and
rightly
considered
to
afford
few
chances
of
lasting
happiness
in
wedded
life
,
still
they
had
lived
together
through
the
one
year
of
their
union
tranquilly
,
if
not
fondly
.
<EOS>
She
had
molded
herself
wisely
to
his
peculiar
humors
,
had
made
the
most
of
his
easy
disposition
;
and
,
when
her
quick
temper
had
got
the
better
of
her
,
had
seldom
hesitated
in
her
cooler
moments
to
acknowledge
that
she
had
been
wrong
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
extravagant
,
it
is
true
,
and
had
irritated
him
by
fits
of
unreasonable
jealousy
;
but
these
were
faults
not
to
be
thought
of
now
.
<EOS>
He
could
only
remember
that
she
was
the
mother
of
his
child
,
and
that
she
lay
ill
but
two
rooms
away
from
him
 
dangerously
ill
,
as
the
doctors
had
unwillingly
confessed
on
that
very
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
darkness
was
closing
in
upon
him
,
and
he
took
up
the
handbell
to
ring
for
lights
.
<EOS>
When
the
servant
entered
there
was
genuine
sorrow
in
his
face
,
genuine
anxiety
in
his
voice
,
as
he
inquired
for
news
from
the
sick
-
room
.
<EOS>
The
man
only
answered
that
his
mistress
was
still
asleep
,
and
then
withdrew
,
after
first
leaving
a
sealed
letter
on
the
table
by
his
master
's
side
.
<EOS>
Fabio
summoned
him
back
into
the
room
,
and
asked
when
the
letter
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
He
replied
that
it
had
been
delivered
at
the
palace
two
days
since
,
and
that
he
had
observed
it
lying
unopened
on
a
desk
in
his
master
's
study
.
  
<EOS>
Left
alone
again
,
Fabio
remembered
that
the
letter
had
arrived
at
a
time
when
the
first
dangerous
symptoms
of
his
wife
's
illness
had
declared
themselves
,
and
that
he
had
thrown
it
aside
,
after
observing
the
address
to
be
in
a
handwriting
unknown
to
him
.
<EOS>
In
his
present
state
of
suspense
,
any
occupation
was
better
than
sitting
idle
.
<EOS>
So
he
took
up
the
letter
with
a
sigh
,
broke
the
seal
,
and
turned
inquiringly
to
the
name
signed
at
the
end
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
"
NANINA
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
started
,
and
changed
color
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
letter
from
her
,
"
he
whispered
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Why
does
it
come
at
such
a
time
as
this
?
"
  
<EOS>
His
face
grew
paler
,
and
the
letter
trembled
in
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
Those
superstitious
feelings
which
he
had
ascribed
to
the
nursery
influences
of
his
childhood
,
when
Father
Rocco
charged
him
with
them
in
the
studio
,
seemed
to
be
overcoming
him
now
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
,
and
listened
anxiously
in
the
direction
of
his
wife
's
room
,
before
reading
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Was
its
arrival
ominous
of
good
or
evil
?
<EOS>
That
was
the
thought
in
his
heart
as
he
drew
the
lamp
near
to
him
,
and
looked
at
the
first
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
wrong
in
writing
to
you
?
"
<EOS>
(
the
letter
began
abruptly
)
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
,
you
have
but
to
throw
this
little
leaf
of
paper
into
the
fire
,
and
to
think
no
more
of
it
after
it
is
burned
up
and
gone
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
reproach
you
for
treating
my
letter
in
that
way
;
for
we
are
never
likely
to
meet
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
did
I
go
away
?
<EOS>
Only
to
save
you
from
the
consequences
of
marrying
a
poor
girl
who
was
not
fit
to
become
your
wife
.
<EOS>
It
almost
broke
my
heart
to
leave
you
;
for
I
had
nothing
to
keep
up
my
courage
but
the
remembrance
that
I
was
going
away
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
I
had
to
think
of
that
,
morning
and
night
 
to
think
of
it
always
,
or
I
am
afraid
I
should
have
faltered
in
my
resolution
,
and
have
gone
back
to
Pisa
.
<EOS>
I
longed
so
much
at
first
to
see
you
once
more
,
only
to
tell
you
that
Nanina
was
not
heartless
and
ungrateful
,
and
that
you
might
pity
her
and
think
kindly
of
her
,
though
you
might
love
her
no
longer
.
  
<EOS>
"
Only
to
tell
you
that
!
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
a
lady
I
might
have
told
it
to
you
in
a
letter
;
but
I
had
never
learned
to
write
,
and
I
could
not
prevail
on
myself
to
get
others
to
take
the
pen
for
me
.
<EOS>
All
I
could
do
was
to
learn
secretly
how
to
write
with
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
It
was
long
,
long
work
;
but
the
uppermost
thought
in
my
heart
was
always
the
thought
of
justifying
myself
to
you
,
and
that
made
me
patient
and
persevering
.
<EOS>
I
learned
,
at
last
,
to
write
so
as
not
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
,
or
to
make
you
ashamed
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
began
a
letter
 
my
first
letter
to
you
 
<EOS>
but
I
heard
of
your
marriage
before
it
was
done
,
and
then
I
had
to
tear
the
paper
up
,
and
put
the
pen
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
no
right
to
come
between
you
and
your
wife
,
even
with
so
little
a
thing
as
a
letter
;
I
had
no
right
to
do
anything
but
hope
and
pray
for
your
happiness
.
<EOS>
Are
you
happy
?
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
ought
to
be
;
for
how
can
your
wife
help
loving
you
?
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
very
hard
for
me
to
explain
why
I
have
ventured
on
writing
now
,
and
yet
I
ca
n't
think
that
I
am
doing
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
heard
a
few
days
ago
(
for
I
have
a
friend
at
Pisa
who
keeps
me
informed
,
by
my
own
desire
,
of
all
the
pleasant
changes
in
your
life
)
 
<EOS>
I
heard
of
your
child
being
born
;
and
I
thought
myself
,
after
that
,
justified
at
last
in
writing
to
you
.
<EOS>
No
letter
from
me
,
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
can
rob
your
child
's
mother
of
so
much
as
a
thought
of
yours
that
is
due
to
her
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
at
least
,
it
seems
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
wish
so
well
to
your
child
,
that
I
can
not
surely
be
doing
wrong
in
writing
these
lines
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
already
what
I
wanted
to
say
 
what
I
have
been
longing
to
say
for
a
whole
year
past
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
why
I
left
Pisa
;
and
have
,
perhaps
,
persuaded
you
that
I
have
gone
through
some
suffering
,
and
borne
some
heart
-
aches
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
Have
I
more
to
write
?
<EOS>
Only
a
word
or
two
,
to
tell
you
that
I
am
earning
my
bread
,
as
I
always
wished
to
earn
it
,
quietly
at
home
 
at
least
,
at
what
I
must
call
home
now
.
<EOS>
I
am
living
with
reputable
people
,
and
I
want
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
La
Biondella
has
grown
very
much
;
she
would
hardly
be
obliged
to
get
on
your
knee
to
kiss
you
now
;
and
she
can
plait
her
dinner
-
mats
faster
and
more
neatly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Our
old
dog
is
with
us
,
and
has
learned
two
new
tricks
;
but
you
ca
n't
be
expected
to
remember
him
,
although
you
were
the
only
stranger
I
ever
saw
him
take
kindly
to
at
first
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
time
I
finished
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
read
this
letter
through
to
the
end
,
I
am
sure
you
will
excuse
me
if
I
have
written
it
badly
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
date
to
it
,
because
I
feel
that
it
is
safest
and
best
for
both
of
us
that
you
should
know
nothing
of
where
I
am
living
.
<EOS>
I
bless
you
and
pray
for
you
,
and
bid
you
affectionately
farewell
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
think
of
me
as
a
sister
,
think
of
me
sometimes
still
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
sighed
bitterly
while
he
read
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
he
whispered
to
himself
,
"
why
does
it
come
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
when
I
can
not
dare
not
think
of
her
?
"
<EOS>
As
he
slowly
folded
the
letter
up
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
,
and
he
half
raised
the
paper
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
some
one
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
started
,
and
felt
himself
changing
color
guiltily
as
one
of
his
servants
entered
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
is
awake
,
"
the
man
said
,
with
a
very
grave
face
,
and
a
very
constrained
manner
;
"
and
the
gentlemen
in
attendance
desire
me
to
say
"
  
He
was
interrupted
,
before
he
could
give
his
message
,
by
one
of
the
medical
men
,
who
had
followed
him
into
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
better
news
to
communicate
,
"
began
the
doctor
,
gently
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
is
worse
,
then
?
"
said
Fabio
,
sinking
back
into
the
chair
from
which
he
had
risen
the
moment
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
She
has
awakened
weaker
instead
of
stronger
after
her
sleep
,
"
returned
the
doctor
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
like
to
give
up
all
hope
till
the
very
last
,
but
"
  
"
It
is
cruel
not
to
be
candid
with
him
,
"
interposed
another
voice
 
the
voice
of
the
doctor
from
Florence
,
who
had
just
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Strengthen
yourself
to
bear
the
worst
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
himself
to
Fabio
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
dying
.
<EOS>
Can
you
compose
yourself
enough
to
go
to
her
bedside
?
"
  
<EOS>
Pale
and
speechless
<EOS>
,
Fabio
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
He
trembled
so
that
the
doctor
who
had
first
spoken
was
obliged
to
lead
him
out
of
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Your
mistress
has
some
near
relations
in
Pisa
,
has
she
not
?
"
said
the
doctor
from
Florence
,
appealing
to
the
servant
who
waited
near
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Her
father
,
sir
,
Signor
Luca
Lomi
;
and
her
uncle
,
Father
Rocco
,
"
answered
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
here
all
through
the
day
,
until
my
mistress
fell
asleep
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
know
where
to
find
them
now
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Signor
Luca
told
me
he
should
be
at
his
studio
,
and
Father
Rocco
said
I
might
find
him
at
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Send
for
them
both
directly
.
<EOS>
Stay
,
who
is
your
mistress
's
confessor
?
<EOS>
He
ought
to
be
summoned
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
mistress
's
confessor
is
Father
Rocco
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
well
 
send
,
or
go
yourself
,
at
once
.
<EOS>
Even
minutes
may
be
of
importance
now
.
"
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
the
doctor
turned
away
,
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
any
last
demands
on
his
services
,
in
the
chair
which
Fabio
had
just
left
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
servant
could
get
to
the
priest
's
lodgings
a
visitor
had
applied
there
for
admission
,
and
had
been
immediately
received
by
Father
Rocco
himself
.
<EOS>
This
favored
guest
was
a
little
man
,
very
sprucely
and
neatly
dressed
,
and
oppressively
polite
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
when
he
first
sat
down
,
he
bowed
when
he
answered
the
usual
inquiries
about
his
health
,
and
he
bowed
,
for
the
third
time
,
when
Father
Rocco
asked
what
had
brought
him
from
Florence
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rather
an
awkward
business
,
"
replied
the
little
man
,
recovering
himself
uneasily
after
his
third
bow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
dressmaker
,
named
Nanina
,
whom
you
placed
under
my
wife
's
protection
about
a
year
ago
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
of
her
?
"
inquired
the
priest
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
to
say
she
has
left
us
,
with
her
child
-
sister
,
and
their
very
disagreeable
dog
,
that
growls
at
everybody
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
did
they
go
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Only
yesterday
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
at
once
to
tell
you
,
as
you
were
so
very
particular
in
recommending
us
to
take
care
of
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
our
fault
that
she
has
gone
.
<EOS>
My
wife
was
kindness
itself
to
her
,
and
I
always
treated
her
like
a
duchess
.
<EOS>
I
bought
dinner
-
mats
of
her
sister
;
I
even
put
up
with
the
thieving
and
growling
of
the
disagreeable
dog
"
  
"
<EOS>
Where
have
they
gone
to
?
<EOS>
Have
you
found
out
that
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
found
out
,
by
application
at
the
passport
-
office
,
that
they
have
not
left
Florence
 
but
what
particular
part
of
the
city
they
have
removed
to
,
I
have
not
yet
had
time
to
discover
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
pray
why
did
they
leave
you
,
in
the
first
place
?
<EOS>
Nanina
is
not
a
girl
to
do
anything
without
a
reason
.
<EOS>
She
must
have
had
some
cause
for
going
away
.
<EOS>
What
was
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
man
hesitated
,
and
made
a
fourth
bow
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
your
private
instructions
to
my
wife
and
myself
,
when
you
first
brought
Nanina
to
our
house
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
away
rather
uneasily
while
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
you
were
to
watch
her
,
but
to
take
care
that
she
did
not
suspect
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
possible
,
at
that
time
,
that
she
might
try
to
get
back
to
Pisa
without
my
knowing
it
;
and
everything
depended
on
her
remaining
at
Florence
.
<EOS>
I
think
,
now
,
that
I
did
wrong
to
distrust
her
;
but
it
was
of
the
last
importance
to
provide
against
all
possibilities
,
and
to
abstain
from
putting
too
much
faith
in
my
own
good
opinion
of
the
girl
.
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
,
I
certainly
did
instruct
you
to
watch
her
privately
.
<EOS>
So
far
you
are
quite
right
;
and
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
remember
,
"
resumed
the
little
man
,
"
that
the
first
consequence
of
our
following
your
instructions
was
a
discovery
(
which
we
immediately
communicated
to
you
)
that
she
was
secretly
learning
to
write
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
and
I
also
remember
sending
you
word
not
to
show
that
you
knew
what
she
was
doing
;
but
to
wait
and
see
if
she
turned
her
knowledge
of
writing
to
account
,
and
took
or
sent
any
letters
to
the
post
.
<EOS>
You
informed
me
,
in
your
regular
monthly
report
,
that
she
nearer
did
anything
of
the
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Never
,
until
three
days
ago
;
and
then
she
was
traced
from
her
room
in
my
house
to
the
post
-
office
with
a
letter
,
which
she
dropped
into
the
box
.
"
  
"
<EOS>
And
the
address
of
which
you
discovered
before
she
took
it
from
your
house
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Unfortunately
I
did
not
,
"
answered
the
little
man
,
reddening
and
looking
askance
at
the
priest
,
as
if
he
expected
to
receive
a
severe
reprimand
.
  
<EOS>
But
Father
Rocco
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
He
was
thinking
.
<EOS>
Who
could
she
have
written
to
?
<EOS>
If
to
Fabio
,
why
should
she
have
waited
for
months
and
months
,
after
she
had
learned
how
to
use
her
pen
,
before
sending
him
a
letter
?
<EOS>
If
not
to
Fabio
,
to
what
other
person
could
she
have
written
?
  
<EOS>
"
I
regret
not
discovering
the
address
 
regret
it
most
deeply
,
"
said
the
little
man
,
with
a
low
bow
of
apology
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
late
for
regret
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
how
she
came
to
leave
your
house
;
I
have
not
heard
that
yet
.
<EOS>
Be
as
brief
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
I
expect
to
be
called
every
moment
to
the
bedside
of
a
near
and
dear
relation
,
who
is
suffering
from
severe
illness
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
all
my
attention
;
but
you
must
ask
it
for
as
short
a
time
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
be
briefness
itself
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
you
must
know
that
I
have
 
or
rather
<EOS>
had
 
an
idle
,
unscrupulous
rascal
of
an
apprentice
in
my
business
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
priest
pursed
up
his
mouth
contemptuously
.
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
second
place
,
this
same
good
-
for
-
nothing
fellow
had
the
impertinence
to
fall
in
love
with
Nanina
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
started
,
and
listened
eagerly
.
  
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
do
the
girl
the
justice
to
say
that
she
never
gave
him
the
slightest
encouragement
;
and
that
,
whenever
he
ventured
to
speak
to
her
,
she
always
quietly
but
very
decidedly
repelled
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
good
girl
!
"
said
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
"
I
always
said
she
was
a
good
girl
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
mistake
on
my
part
ever
to
have
distrusted
her
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Among
the
other
offenses
,
"
continued
the
little
man
,
"
of
which
I
now
find
my
scoundrel
of
an
apprentice
to
have
been
guilty
,
was
the
enormity
of
picking
the
lock
of
my
desk
,
and
prying
into
my
private
papers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
ought
not
to
have
had
any
.
<EOS>
Private
papers
should
always
be
burned
papers
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
They
shall
be
for
the
future
;
I
will
take
good
care
of
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Were
any
of
my
letters
to
you
about
Nanina
among
these
private
papers
?
"
  
"
Unfortunately
they
were
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
pray
excuse
my
want
of
caution
this
time
.
<EOS>
It
shall
never
happen
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Go
on
.
<EOS>
Such
imprudence
as
yours
can
never
be
excused
;
it
can
only
be
provided
against
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
apprentice
showed
my
letters
to
the
girl
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
infer
as
much
;
though
why
he
should
do
so
"
  
"
Simpleton
!
<EOS>
Did
you
not
say
that
he
was
in
love
with
her
(
as
you
term
it
)
,
and
that
he
got
no
encouragement
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
I
said
that
 
<EOS>
and
I
know
it
to
be
true
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
!
Was
it
not
his
interest
,
being
unable
to
make
any
impression
on
the
girl
's
fancy
,
to
establish
some
claim
to
her
gratitude
;
and
try
if
he
could
not
win
her
that
way
?
<EOS>
By
showing
her
my
letters
,
he
would
make
her
indebted
to
him
for
knowing
that
she
was
watched
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
matter
in
question
now
.
<EOS>
You
say
you
infer
that
she
had
seen
my
letters
.
<EOS>
On
what
grounds
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
strength
of
this
bit
of
paper
,
"
answered
the
little
man
,
ruefully
producing
a
note
from
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
have
had
your
letters
shown
to
her
soon
after
putting
her
own
letter
into
the
post
.
<EOS>
For
,
on
the
evening
of
the
same
day
,
when
I
went
up
into
her
room
,
I
found
that
she
and
her
sister
and
the
disagreeable
dog
had
all
gone
,
and
observed
this
note
laid
on
the
table
.
"
  
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
took
the
note
,
and
read
these
lines
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
discovered
that
I
have
been
watched
and
suspected
ever
since
my
stay
under
your
roof
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
that
I
can
remain
another
night
in
the
house
of
a
spy
.
<EOS>
I
go
with
my
sister
.
<EOS>
We
owe
you
nothing
,
and
we
are
free
to
live
honestly
where
we
please
.
<EOS>
If
you
see
Father
Rocco
,
tell
him
that
I
can
forgive
his
distrust
of
me
,
but
that
I
can
never
forget
it
.
<EOS>
I
,
who
had
full
faith
in
him
,
had
a
right
to
expect
that
he
should
have
full
faith
in
me
.
<EOS>
It
was
always
an
encouragement
to
me
to
think
of
him
as
a
father
and
a
friend
.
<EOS>
I
have
lost
that
encouragement
forever
 
<EOS>
and
it
was
the
last
I
had
left
to
me
!

NANINA

<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
priest
rose
from
his
seat
as
he
handed
the
note
back
,
and
the
visitor
immediately
followed
his
example
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
must
remedy
this
misfortune
as
we
best
may
,
"
he
said
,
with
a
sigh
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
ready
to
go
back
to
Florence
to
-
morrow
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
little
man
bowed
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
Find
out
where
she
is
,
and
ascertain
if
she
wants
for
anything
,
and
if
she
is
living
in
a
safe
place

<EOS>
Say
nothing
about
me

and
make
no
attempt
to
induce
her
to
return
to
your
house

<EOS>
Simply
let
me
know
what
you
discover

<EOS>
The
poor
child
has
a
spirit
that
no
ordinary
people
would
suspect
in
her
.
<EOS>
She
must
be
soothed
and
treated
tenderly

we
shall
manage
her
yet

No

Do
just
what
I
tell
you

no

Have
you
anything
else
to
say
to
me

<EOS>
The
little
man
shook
his
head
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night
,
then

said
the
priest
.
  
<EOS>
"
Good
-
night

"
said
the
little
man
,
slipping
through
the
door
that
was
held
open
for
him
with
the
politest
alacrity
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
vexatious
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
taking
a
turn
or
two
in
the
study
after
his
visitor
had
gone
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
bad
to
have
done
the
child
an
injustice
 
<EOS>
it
is
worse
to
have
been
found
out

<EOS>
There
is
nothing
for
it
now

to
wait
till
I
know
where

<EOS>
I
like
her

I
like
that
note

she
left
behind
her

It

bravely

delicately
,

honestly
written
 
a

a

<EOS>
He
walked
to
the
window
,
breathed
the
fresh
air
for
a
few
moments
,
and
quietly
dismissed
the
subject
from
his
mind
.
<EOS>
When
he
returned
to
his
table
he
had
no
thoughts
for
any
one
but
his
sick
niece
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
seems
strange
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
I
have
had
no
message
about
her
yet

<EOS>
Perhaps
Luca
has
heard
something
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
well
if
I
go
to
the
studio
at
once
to
find
out
.

<EOS>
He
took
up
his
hat
and
went
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
opened
it
,
Fabio
's
servant
confronted
him
on
the
thresh
old
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sent
to
summon
you
to
the
palace
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
The
doctors
have
given
up
all
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
turned
deadly
pale
,
and
drew
back
a
step
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
told
my
brother
of
this
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
on
my
way
to
the
studio
,
"
answered
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
there
instead
of
you
,
and
break
the
bad
news
to
him
,
"
said
the
priest
.
  
<EOS>
They
descended
the
stairs
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Just
as
they
were
about
to
separate
at
the
street
door
,
Father
Rocco
stopped
the
servant
.
  
<EOS>
"
How
is
the
child
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
with
such
sudden
eagerness
and
impatience
,
that
the
man
looked
quite
startled
as
he
answered
that
the
child
was
perfectly
well
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
is
some
consolation
in
that
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
walking
away
,
and
speaking
partly
to
the
servant
,
partly
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
My
caution
has
misled
me
,
"
he
continued
,
pausing
thoughtfully
when
he
was
left
alone
in
the
roadway
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
risked
using
the
mother
's
influence
sooner
to
procure
the
righteous
restitution
.
<EOS>
All
hope
of
compassing
it
now
rests
on
the
life
of
the
child
.
<EOS>
Infant
as
she
is
,
her
father
's
ill
-
gotten
wealth
may
yet
be
gathered
back
to
the
Church
by
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
proceeded
rapidly
on
his
way
to
the
studio
,
until
he
reached
the
river
-
side
and
drew
close
to
the
bridge
which
it
was
necessary
to
cross
in
order
to
get
to
his
brother
's
house
.
<EOS>
Here
he
stopped
abruptly
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
.
<EOS>
The
moon
had
just
risen
,
and
her
light
,
streaming
across
the
river
,
fell
full
upon
his
face
as
he
stood
by
the
parapet
wall
that
led
up
to
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
lost
in
thought
that
he
did
not
hear
the
conversation
of
two
ladies
who
were
advancing
along
the
pathway
close
behind
him
.
<EOS>
As
they
brushed
by
him
,
the
taller
of
the
two
turned
round
and
looked
back
at
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Father
Rocco
!
"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
stopping
.
  
<EOS>
"
Donna
Brigida
!
"
cried
the
priest
,
looking
surprised
at
first
,
but
recovering
himself
directly
and
bowing
with
his
usual
quiet
politeness
.
"
<EOS>
Pardon
me
if
I
thank
you
for
honoring
me
by
renewing
our
acquaintance
,
and
then
pass
on
to
my
brother
's
studio
.
<EOS>
A
heavy
affliction
is
likely
to
befall
us
,
and
I
go
to
prepare
him
for
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
refer
to
the
dangerous
illness
of
your
niece
?
"
said
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
of
it
this
evening
.
<EOS>
Let
us
hope
that
your
fears
are
exaggerated
,
and
that
we
may
yet
meet
under
less
distressing
circumstances
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
present
intention
of
leaving
Pisa
for
some
time
,
and
I
shall
always
be
glad
to
thank
Father
Rocco
for
the
politeness
and
consideration
which
he
showed
to
me
,
under
delicate
circumstances
,
a
year
ago
.
<EOS>
"
  
With
these
words
she
courtesied
deferentially
,
and
moved
away
to
rejoin
her
friend
.
<EOS>
The
priest
observed
that
Mademoiselle
Virginie
lingered
rather
near
,
as
if
anxious
to
catch
a
few
words
of
the
conversation
between
Brigida
and
himself
.
<EOS>
Seeing
this
,
he
,
in
his
turn
,
listened
as
the
two
women
slowly
walked
away
together
,
and
heard
the
Italian
say
to
her
companion
:
"
Virginie
,
I
will
lay
you
the
price
of
a
new
dress
that
Fabio
d'Ascoli
marries
again
.
"
  
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
started
when
she
said
those
words
,
as
if
he
had
trodden
on
fire
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
thought
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
nervously
to
himself
.
<EOS>
"
My
thought
at
the
moment
when
she
spoke
to
me
!
<EOS>
Marry
again
?
<EOS>
Another
wife
,
over
whom
I
should
have
no
influence
!
<EOS>
Other
children
,
whose
education
would
not
be
confided
to
me
!
<EOS>
What
would
become
,
then
,
of
the
restitution
that
I
have
hoped
for
,
wrought
for
,
prayed
for
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
,
and
looked
fixedly
at
the
sky
above
him
.
<EOS>
The
bridge
was
deserted
.
<EOS>
His
black
figure
rose
up
erect
,
motionless
,
and
spectral
,
with
the
white
still
light
falling
solemnly
all
around
it
.
<EOS>
Standing
so
for
some
minutes
,
his
first
movement
was
to
drop
his
hand
angrily
on
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
He
then
turned
round
slowly
in
the
direction
by
which
the
two
women
had
walked
away
.
  
<EOS>
"
Donna
Brigida
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
will
lay
you
the
price
of
fifty
new
dresses
that
Fabio
d'Ascoli
never
marries
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
set
his
face
once
more
toward
the
studio
,
and
walked
on
without
stopping
until
he
arrived
at
the
master
-
sculptor
's
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Marry
again
?
"
<EOS>
he
thought
to
himself
,
as
he
rang
the
bell
.
"
<EOS>
Donna
Brigida
,
was
your
first
failure
not
enough
for
you
?
<EOS>
Are
you
going
to
try
a
second
time
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
himself
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
drew
Father
Rocco
hurriedly
into
the
studio
toward
a
single
lamp
burning
on
a
stand
near
the
partition
between
the
two
rooms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
heard
anything
of
our
poor
child
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
"
<EOS>
Tell
me
the
truth
!
<EOS>
tell
me
the
truth
at
once
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
compose
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
in
low
,
mournful
tones
.
  
<EOS>
Luca
tightened
his
hold
on
the
priest
's
arm
,
and
looked
into
his
face
with
breathless
,
speechless
eagerness
.
  
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
,
"
repeated
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
"
Compose
yourself
to
hear
the
worst
.
<EOS>
My
poor
Luca
,
the
doctors
have
given
up
all
hope
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Luca
dropped
his
brother
's
arm
with
a
groan
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Maddalena
!
<EOS>
my
child
 
<EOS>
my
only
child
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Reiterating
these
words
again
and
again
,
he
leaned
his
head
against
the
partition
and
burst
into
tears
.
<EOS>
Sordid
and
coarse
as
his
nature
was
,
he
really
loved
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
All
the
heart
he
had
was
in
his
statues
and
in
her
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
first
burst
of
his
grief
was
exhausted
,
he
was
recalled
to
himself
by
a
sensation
as
if
some
change
had
taken
place
in
the
lighting
of
the
studio
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
directly
,
and
dimly
discerned
the
priest
standing
far
down
at
the
end
of
the
room
nearest
the
door
,
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
,
eagerly
looking
at
something
.
  
<EOS>
"
Rocco
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
"
Rocco
,
why
have
you
taken
the
lamp
away
?
<EOS>
What
are
you
doing
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
movement
and
no
answer
.
<EOS>
Luca
advanced
a
step
or
two
,
and
called
again
.
<EOS>
"
Rocco
,
what
are
you
doing
there
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
priest
heard
this
time
,
and
came
suddenly
toward
his
brother
,
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
 
<EOS>
so
suddenly
that
Luca
started
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
astonishment
.
"
<EOS>
Gracious
God
,
Rocco
,
how
pale
you
are
!
"
  
<EOS>
Still
the
priest
never
said
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
put
the
lamp
down
on
the
nearest
table
.
<EOS>
Luca
observed
that
his
hand
shook
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
seen
his
brother
violently
agitated
before
.
<EOS>
When
Rocco
had
announced
,
but
a
few
minutes
ago
,
that
Maddalena
's
life
was
despaired
of
<EOS>
,
it
was
in
a
voice
which
,
though
sorrowful
,
was
perfectly
calm
.
<EOS>
What
was
the
meaning
of
this
sudden
panic
 
this
strange
,
silent
terror
?
  
<EOS>
The
priest
observed
that
his
brother
was
looking
at
him
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
in
a
faint
whisper
,
"
come
to
her
bedside
:
we
have
no
time
to
lose
.
<EOS>
Get
your
hat
,
and
leave
it
to
me
to
put
out
the
lamp
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
hurriedly
extinguished
the
light
while
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
They
went
down
the
studio
side
by
side
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
moonlight
streamed
through
the
window
full
on
the
place
where
the
priest
had
been
standing
alone
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
it
,
Luca
felt
his
brother
tremble
,
and
saw
him
turn
away
his
head
.
                
.
    
.
    
.
    
.
    
.
    
.
    
.
    
.
  
<EOS>
Two
hours
later
,
Fabio
d'Ascoli
and
his
wife
were
separated
in
this
world
forever
;
and
the
servants
of
the
palace
were
anticipating
in
whispers
the
order
of
their
mistress
's
funeral
procession
to
the
burial
-
ground
of
the
Campo
Santo
.

PART
THIRD
.
   
<EOS>
CHAPTER
I.
  
About
eight
months
after
the
Countess
d'Ascoli
had
been
laid
in
her
grave
in
the
Campo
Santo
<EOS>
,
two
reports
were
circulated
through
the
gay
world
of
Pisa
,
which
excited
curiosity
and
awakened
expectation
everywhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
report
announced
that
a
grand
masked
ball
was
to
be
given
at
the
Melani
Palace
,
to
celebrate
the
day
on
which
the
heir
of
the
house
attained
his
majority
.
<EOS>
All
the
friends
of
the
family
were
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
this
festival
;
for
the
old
Marquis
Melani
had
the
reputation
of
being
one
of
the
most
hospitable
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
of
the
most
eccentric
men
in
Pisa
.
<EOS>
Every
one
expected
,
therefore
,
that
he
would
secure
for
the
entertainment
of
his
guests
,
if
he
really
gave
the
ball
,
the
most
whimsical
novelties
in
the
way
of
masks
,
dances
,
and
amusements
generally
,
that
had
ever
been
seen
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
report
was
,
that
the
rich
widower
,
Fabio
d'Ascoli
,
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
Pisa
,
after
having
improved
his
health
and
spirits
by
traveling
in
foreign
countries
;
and
that
he
might
be
expected
to
appear
again
in
society
,
for
the
first
time
since
the
death
of
his
wife
,
at
the
masked
ball
which
was
to
be
given
in
the
Melani
Palace
.
<EOS>
This
announcement
excited
special
interest
among
the
young
ladies
of
Pisa
.
<EOS>
Fabio
had
only
reached
his
thirtieth
year
;
and
it
was
universally
agreed
that
his
return
to
society
in
his
native
city
could
indicate
nothing
more
certainly
than
his
desire
to
find
a
second
mother
for
his
infant
child
.
<EOS>
All
the
single
ladies
would
now
have
been
ready
to
bet
,
as
confidently
as
Brigida
had
offered
to
bet
eight
months
before
,
that
Fabio
d'Ascoli
would
marry
again
.
  
<EOS>
For
once
in
a
way
,
report
turned
out
to
be
true
,
in
both
the
cases
just
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Invitations
were
actually
issued
from
the
Melani
Palace
,
and
Fabio
returned
from
abroad
to
his
home
on
the
Arno
.
  
<EOS>
In
settling
all
the
arrangements
connected
with
his
masked
ball
,
the
Marquis
Melani
showed
that
he
was
determined
not
only
to
deserve
,
but
to
increase
,
his
reputation
for
oddity
.
<EOS>
He
invented
the
most
extravagant
disguises
,
to
be
worn
by
some
of
his
more
intimate
friends
;
he
arranged
grotesque
dances
,
to
be
performed
at
stated
periods
of
the
evening
by
professional
buffoons
,
hired
from
Florence
.
<EOS>
He
composed
a
toy
symphony
,
which
included
solos
on
every
noisy
plaything
at
that
time
manufactured
for
children
's
use
.
<EOS>
And
not
content
with
thus
avoiding
the
beaten
track
in
preparing
the
entertainments
at
the
ball
,
he
determined
also
to
show
decided
originality
,
even
in
selecting
the
attendants
who
were
to
wait
on
the
company
.
<EOS>
Other
people
in
his
rank
of
life
were
accustomed
to
employ
their
own
and
hired
footmen
for
this
purpose
;
the
marquis
resolved
that
his
attendants
should
be
composed
of
young
women
only
;
that
two
of
his
rooms
should
be
fitted
up
as
Arcadian
bowers
;
and
that
all
the
prettiest
girls
in
Pisa
should
be
placed
in
them
to
preside
over
the
refreshments
,
dressed
,
in
accordance
with
the
mock
classical
taste
of
the
period
,
as
shepherdesses
of
the
time
of
Virgil
.
  
<EOS>
The
only
defect
of
this
brilliantly
new
idea
was
the
difficulty
of
executing
it
.
<EOS>
The
marquis
had
expressly
ordered
that
not
fewer
than
thirty
shepherdesses
were
to
be
engaged
 
fifteen
for
each
bower
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
easy
to
find
double
this
number
in
Pisa
,
if
beauty
had
been
the
only
quality
required
in
the
attendant
damsels
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
also
absolutely
necessary
,
for
the
security
of
the
marquis
's
gold
and
silver
plate
,
that
the
shepherdesses
should
possess
,
besides
good
looks
,
the
very
homely
recommendation
of
a
fair
character
.
<EOS>
This
last
qualification
proved
,
it
is
sad
to
say
,
to
be
the
one
small
merit
which
the
majority
of
the
ladies
willing
to
accept
engagements
at
the
palace
did
not
possess
.
<EOS>
Day
after
day
passed
on
;
and
the
marquis
's
steward
only
found
more
and
more
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
appointed
number
of
trustworthy
beauties
.
<EOS>
At
last
his
resources
failed
him
altogether
;
and
he
appeared
in
his
master
's
presence
about
a
week
before
the
night
of
the
ball
,
to
make
the
humiliating
acknowledgment
that
he
was
entirely
at
his
wits
'
end
.
<EOS>
The
total
number
of
fair
shepherdesses
with
fair
characters
whom
he
had
been
able
to
engage
amounted
only
to
twenty
-
three
.
  
<EOS>
"
Nonsense
!
"
cried
the
marquis
,
irritably
,
as
soon
as
the
steward
had
made
his
confession
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
to
get
thirty
girls
,
and
thirty
I
mean
to
have
.
<EOS>
What
's
the
use
of
shaking
your
head
when
all
their
dresses
are
ordered
?
<EOS>
Thirty
tunics
,
thirty
wreaths
,
thirty
pairs
of
sandals
and
silk
stockings
,
thirty
crooks
,
you
scoundrel
 
<EOS>
and
you
have
the
impudence
to
offer
me
only
twenty
-
three
hands
to
hold
them
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
!
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
hear
a
word
!
<EOS>
Get
me
my
thirty
girls
,
or
lose
your
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
marquis
roared
out
this
last
terrible
sentence
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
and
pointed
peremptorily
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
steward
knew
his
master
too
well
to
remonstrate
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
hat
and
cane
,
and
went
out
.
<EOS>
It
was
useless
to
look
through
the
ranks
of
rejected
volunteers
again
;
there
was
not
the
slightest
hope
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
The
only
chance
left
was
to
call
on
all
his
friends
in
Pisa
who
had
daughters
out
at
service
,
and
to
try
what
he
could
accomplish
,
by
bribery
and
persuasion
,
that
way
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
whole
day
occupied
in
solicitations
,
promises
,
and
patient
smoothing
down
of
innumerable
difficulties
,
the
result
of
his
efforts
in
the
new
direction
was
an
accession
of
six
more
shepherdesses
.
<EOS>
This
brought
him
on
bravely
from
twenty
-
three
to
twenty
-
nine
,
and
left
him
,
at
last
,
with
only
one
anxiety
 
<EOS>
where
was
he
now
to
find
shepherdess
number
thirty
?
  
<EOS>
He
mentally
asked
himself
that
important
question
,
as
he
entered
a
shady
by
-
street
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Campo
Santo
,
on
his
way
back
to
the
Melani
Palace
.
<EOS>
Sauntering
slowly
along
in
the
middle
of
the
road
,
and
fanning
himself
with
his
handkerchief
after
the
oppressive
exertions
of
the
day
,
he
passed
a
young
girl
who
was
standing
at
the
street
door
of
one
of
the
houses
,
apparently
waiting
for
somebody
to
join
her
before
she
entered
the
building
.
  
<EOS>
"
Body
of
Bacchus
!
"
exclaimed
the
steward
(
using
one
of
those
old
Pagan
ejaculations
which
survive
in
Italy
even
to
the
present
day
)
,
"
there
stands
the
prettiest
girl
I
have
seen
yet
.
<EOS>
If
she
would
only
be
shepherdess
number
thirty
,
I
should
go
home
to
supper
with
my
mind
at
ease
.
<EOS>
I
'll
ask
her
,
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
Nothing
can
be
lost
by
asking
,
and
everything
may
be
gained
.
<EOS>
Stop
,
my
dear
,
"
he
continued
,
seeing
the
girl
turn
to
go
into
the
house
as
he
approached
her
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
steward
to
the
Marquis
Melani
,
and
well
known
in
Pisa
as
an
eminently
respectable
man
.
<EOS>
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
which
may
be
greatly
for
your
benefit
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
look
surprised
;
I
am
coming
to
the
point
at
once
.
<EOS>
Do
you
want
to
earn
a
little
money
?
<EOS>
honestly
,
of
course
.
<EOS>
You
do
n't
look
as
if
you
were
very
rich
,
child
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
very
poor
,
and
very
much
in
want
of
some
honest
work
to
do
,
"
answered
the
girl
,
sadly
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
shall
suit
each
other
to
a
nicety
;
for
I
have
work
of
the
pleasantest
kind
to
give
you
,
and
plenty
of
money
to
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
before
we
say
anything
more
about
that
,
suppose
you
tell
me
first
something
about
yourself
 
who
you
are
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
You
know
who
I
am
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
only
a
poor
work
-
girl
,
and
my
name
is
Nanina
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
,
sir
,
to
say
about
myself
than
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
belong
to
Pisa
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
 
at
least
,
I
did
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
been
away
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
year
at
Florence
,
employed
in
needlework
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
All
by
yourself
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sir
,
with
my
little
sister
.
<EOS>
I
was
waiting
for
her
when
you
came
up
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Have
you
never
done
anything
else
but
needlework
?
<EOS>
never
been
out
at
service
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
eight
months
I
have
had
a
situation
to
wait
on
a
lady
at
Florence
,
and
my
sister
(
who
is
turned
eleven
,
sir
,
and
can
make
herself
very
useful
)
was
allowed
to
help
in
the
nursery
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
came
you
to
leave
this
situation
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
lady
and
her
family
were
going
to
Rome
,
sir
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
taken
me
with
them
,
but
they
could
not
take
my
sister
.
<EOS>
We
are
alone
in
the
world
,
and
we
never
have
been
parted
from
each
other
,
and
never
shall
be
 
so
I
was
obliged
to
leave
the
situation
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
here
you
are
,
back
at
Pisa
 
with
nothing
to
do
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Nothing
yet
,
sir
.
<EOS>
We
only
came
back
yesterday
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Only
yesterday
!
<EOS>
You
are
a
lucky
girl
,
let
me
tell
you
,
to
have
met
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
have
somebody
in
the
town
who
can
speak
to
your
character
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
landlady
of
this
house
can
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
who
is
she
,
pray
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Marta
Angrisani
,
sir
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
the
well
-
known
sick
-
nurse
?
<EOS>
You
could
not
possibly
have
a
better
recommendation
,
child
.
<EOS>
I
remember
her
being
employed
at
the
Melani
Palace
at
the
time
of
the
marquis
's
last
attack
of
gout
;
but
I
never
knew
that
she
kept
a
lodging
-
house
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
and
her
daughter
,
sir
,
have
owned
this
house
longer
than
I
can
recollect
.
<EOS>
My
sister
and
I
have
lived
in
it
since
I
was
quite
a
little
child
,
and
I
had
hoped
we
might
be
able
to
live
here
again
.
<EOS>
But
the
top
room
we
used
to
have
is
taken
,
and
the
room
to
let
lower
down
is
far
more
,
I
am
afraid
,
than
we
can
afford
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
How
much
is
it
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
mentioned
the
weekly
rent
of
the
room
in
fear
and
trembling
.
<EOS>
The
steward
burst
out
laughing
.
  
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
offered
you
money
enough
to
be
able
to
take
that
room
for
a
whole
year
at
once
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
Nanina
looked
at
him
in
speechless
amazement
.
 
<EOS>
"
Suppose
I
offered
you
that
?
"
continued
the
steward
.
"
<EOS>
And
suppose
I
only
ask
you
in
return
to
put
on
a
fine
dress
and
serve
refreshments
in
a
beautiful
room
to
the
company
at
the
Marquis
Melani
's
grand
ball
?
<EOS>
What
should
you
say
to
that
?
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
She
drew
back
a
step
or
two
,
and
looked
more
bewildered
than
before
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
must
have
heard
of
the
ball
,
"
said
the
steward
,
pompously
;
"
the
poorest
people
in
Pisa
have
heard
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
talk
of
the
whole
city
.
"
  
<EOS>
Still
Nanina
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
To
have
replied
truthfully
,
she
must
have
confessed
that
"
the
talk
of
the
whole
city
"
had
now
no
interest
for
her
.
<EOS>
The
last
news
from
Pisa
that
had
appealed
to
her
sympathies
was
the
news
of
the
Countess
d'Ascoli
's
death
,
and
of
Fabio
's
departure
to
travel
in
foreign
countries
.
<EOS>
Since
then
she
had
heard
nothing
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
as
ignorant
of
his
return
to
his
native
city
as
of
all
the
reports
connected
with
the
marquis
's
ball
.
<EOS>
Something
in
her
own
heart
 
<EOS>
some
feeling
which
she
had
neither
the
desire
nor
the
capacity
to
analyze
 
had
brought
her
back
to
Pisa
and
to
the
old
home
which
now
connected
itself
with
her
tenderest
recollections
.
<EOS>
Believing
that
Fabio
was
still
absent
,
she
felt
that
no
ill
motive
could
now
be
attributed
to
her
return
;
and
she
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
of
revisiting
the
scene
that
had
been
associated
with
the
first
great
happiness
as
well
as
with
the
first
great
sorrow
of
her
life
.
<EOS>
Among
all
the
poor
people
of
Pisa
,
she
was
perhaps
the
very
last
whose
curiosity
could
be
awakened
,
or
whose
attention
could
be
attracted
by
the
rumor
of
gayeties
at
the
Melani
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
could
not
confess
all
this
;
she
could
only
listen
with
great
humility
and
no
small
surprise
,
while
the
steward
,
in
compassion
for
her
ignorance
,
and
with
the
hope
of
tempting
her
into
accepting
his
offered
engagement
,
described
the
arrangements
of
the
approaching
festival
,
and
dwelt
fondly
on
the
magnificence
of
the
Arcadian
bowers
,
and
the
beauty
of
the
shepherdesses
'
tunics
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
done
,
Nanina
ventured
on
the
confession
that
she
should
feel
rather
nervous
in
a
grand
dress
that
did
not
belong
to
her
,
and
that
she
doubted
very
much
her
own
capability
of
waiting
properly
on
the
great
people
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
The
steward
,
however
,
would
hear
of
no
objections
,
and
called
peremptorily
for
Marta
Angrisani
to
make
the
necessary
statement
as
to
Nanina
's
character
.
<EOS>
While
this
formality
was
being
complied
with
to
the
steward
's
perfect
satisfaction
,
La
Biondella
came
in
,
unaccompanied
on
this
occasion
by
the
usual
companion
of
all
her
walks
,
the
learned
poodle
Scarammuccia
.
  
<EOS>
"
This
is
Nanina
's
sister
,
"
said
the
good
-
natured
sick
-
nurse
,
taking
the
first
opportunity
of
introducing
La
Biondella
to
the
great
marquis
's
great
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
very
good
,
industrious
little
girl
;
and
very
clever
at
plaiting
dinner
-
mats
,
in
case
his
excellency
should
ever
want
any
.
<EOS>
What
have
you
done
with
the
dog
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
could
n't
get
him
past
the
pork
butcher
's
,
three
streets
off
,
"
replied
La
Biondella
.
<EOS>
"
He
would
sit
down
and
look
at
the
sausages
.
<EOS>
I
am
more
than
half
afraid
he
means
to
steal
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
A
very
pretty
child
,
"
said
the
steward
,
patting
La
Biondella
on
the
cheek
.
<EOS>
"
We
ought
to
have
her
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
If
his
excellency
should
want
a
Cupid
,
or
a
youthful
nymph
,
or
anything
small
and
light
in
that
way
,
I
shall
come
back
and
let
you
know
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
Nanina
,
consider
yourself
Shepherdess
Number
Thirty
,
and
come
to
the
housekeeper
's
room
at
the
palace
to
try
on
your
dress
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Nonsense
!
<EOS>
do
n't
talk
to
me
about
being
afraid
and
awkward
.
<EOS>
All
you
're
wanted
to
do
is
to
look
pretty
;
and
your
glass
must
have
told
you
you
could
do
that
long
ago
.
<EOS>
Remember
the
rent
of
the
room
,
my
dear
,
and
do
n't
stand
in
your
light
and
your
sister
's
.
<EOS>
Does
the
little
girl
like
sweetmeats
?
<EOS>
Of
course
she
does
!
<EOS>
Well
,
I
promise
you
a
whole
box
of
sugar
-
plums
to
take
home
for
her
,
if
you
will
come
and
wait
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
go
to
the
ball
,
Nanina
;
go
to
the
ball
!
"
<EOS>
cried
La
Biondella
,
clapping
her
hands
.
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
she
will
go
to
the
ball
,
"
said
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
She
would
be
mad
to
throw
away
such
an
excellent
chance
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
looked
perplexed
.
<EOS>
She
hesitated
a
little
,
then
drew
Marta
Angrisani
away
into
a
corner
,
and
whispered
this
question
to
her
:
  
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
there
will
be
any
priests
at
the
palace
where
the
marquis
lives
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Heavens
,
child
,
what
a
thing
to
ask
!
"
returned
the
nurse
.
<EOS>
"
Priests
at
a
masked
ball
!
<EOS>
You
might
as
well
expect
to
find
Turks
performing
high
mass
in
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
But
supposing
you
did
meet
with
priests
at
the
palace
,
what
then
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Nothing
,
"
said
Nanina
,
constrainedly
.
<EOS>
She
turned
pale
,
and
walked
away
as
she
spoke
.
<EOS>
Her
great
dread
,
in
returning
to
Pisa
,
was
the
dread
of
meeting
with
Father
Rocco
again
.
<EOS>
She
had
never
forgotten
her
first
discovery
at
Florence
of
his
distrust
of
her
.
<EOS>
The
bare
thought
of
seeing
him
any
more
,
after
her
faith
in
him
had
been
shaken
forever
,
made
her
feel
faint
and
sick
at
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
-
morrow
,
in
the
housekeeper
's
room
,
"
said
the
steward
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
"
you
will
find
your
new
dress
all
ready
for
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
courtesied
,
and
ventured
on
no
more
objections
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
of
securing
a
home
for
a
whole
year
to
come
among
people
whom
she
knew
,
reconciled
her
 
influenced
as
she
was
also
by
Marta
Angrisani
's
advice
,
and
by
her
sister
's
anxiety
for
the
promised
present
 
to
brave
the
trial
of
appearing
at
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
a
comfort
to
have
it
all
settled
at
last
,
"
said
the
steward
,
as
soon
as
he
was
out
again
in
the
street
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
what
the
marquis
says
now
.
<EOS>
If
he
does
n't
apologize
for
calling
me
a
scoundrel
the
moment
he
sets
eyes
on
Number
Thirty
,
he
is
the
most
ungrateful
nobleman
that
ever
existed
.
"
  
<EOS>
Arriving
in
front
of
the
palace
,
the
steward
found
workmen
engaged
in
planning
the
external
decorations
and
illuminations
for
the
night
of
the
ball
.
<EOS>
A
little
crowd
had
already
assembled
to
see
the
ladders
raised
and
the
scaffoldings
put
up
.
<EOS>
He
observed
among
them
,
standing
near
the
outskirts
of
the
throng
,
a
lady
who
attracted
his
attention
<EOS>
(
he
was
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
fair
sex
)
by
the
beauty
and
symmetry
of
her
figure
.
<EOS>
While
he
lingered
for
a
moment
to
look
at
her
,
a
shaggy
poodle
-
dog
<EOS>
(
licking
his
chops
,
as
if
he
had
just
had
something
to
eat
)
trotted
by
,
stopped
suddenly
close
to
the
lady
,
sniffed
suspiciously
for
an
instant
,
and
then
began
to
growl
at
her
without
the
slightest
apparent
provocation
.
<EOS>
The
steward
advancing
politely
with
his
stick
to
drive
the
dog
away
,
saw
the
lady
start
,
and
heard
her
exclaim
to
herself
amazedly
:
  
"
You
here
,
you
beast
!
<EOS>
Can
Nanina
have
come
back
to
Pisa
?
"
  
<EOS>
This
last
exclamation
gave
the
steward
,
as
a
gallant
man
,
an
excuse
for
speaking
to
the
elegant
stranger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Excuse
me
,
madam
,
"
he
said
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
heard
you
mention
the
name
of
Nanina
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
whether
you
mean
a
pretty
little
work
-
girl
who
lives
near
the
Campo
Santo
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
"
said
the
lady
,
looking
very
much
surprised
and
interested
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
may
be
a
gratification
to
you
,
madam
,
to
know
that
she
has
just
returned
to
Pisa
,
"
continued
the
steward
,
politely
;
"
and
,
moreover
,
that
she
is
in
a
fair
way
to
rise
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
I
have
just
engaged
her
to
wait
at
the
marquis
's
grand
ball
,
and
I
need
hardly
say
,
under
those
circumstances
,
that
if
she
plays
her
cards
properly
her
fortune
is
made
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
lady
bowed
,
looked
at
her
informant
very
intently
and
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
,
then
suddenly
walked
away
without
uttering
a
word
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
curious
woman
,
"
thought
the
steward
,
entering
the
palace
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
ask
Number
Thirty
about
her
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
death
of
Maddalena
d'Ascoli
produced
a
complete
change
in
the
lives
of
her
father
and
her
uncle
.
<EOS>
After
the
first
shock
of
the
bereavement
was
over
,
Luca
Lomi
declared
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
work
in
his
studio
again
 
for
some
time
to
come
at
least
 
after
the
death
of
the
beloved
daughter
,
with
whom
every
corner
of
it
was
now
so
sadly
and
closely
associated
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
accepted
an
engagement
to
assist
in
restoring
several
newly
discovered
works
of
ancient
sculpture
at
Naples
,
and
set
forth
for
that
city
,
leaving
the
care
of
his
work
-
rooms
at
Pisa
entirely
to
his
 
brother
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
master
-
sculptor
's
departure
,
Father
Rocco
caused
the
statues
and
busts
to
be
carefully
enveloped
in
linen
cloths
,
locked
the
studio
doors
,
and
,
to
the
astonishment
of
all
who
knew
of
his
former
industry
and
dexterity
as
a
sculptor
,
never
approached
the
place
again
.
<EOS>
His
clerical
duties
he
performed
with
the
same
assiduity
as
ever
;
but
he
went
out
less
than
had
been
his
custom
hitherto
to
the
houses
of
his
friends
.
<EOS>
His
most
regular
visits
were
to
the
Ascoli
Palace
,
to
inquire
at
the
porter
's
lodge
after
the
health
of
Maddalena
's
child
,
who
was
always
reported
to
be
thriving
admirably
under
the
care
of
the
best
nurses
that
could
be
found
in
Pisa
.
<EOS>
As
for
any
communications
with
his
polite
little
friend
from
Florence
,
they
had
ceased
months
ago
.
<EOS>
The
information
 
speedily
conveyed
to
him
 
that
Nanina
was
in
the
service
of
one
of
the
most
respectable
ladies
in
the
city
seemed
to
relieve
any
anxieties
which
he
might
otherwise
have
felt
on
her
account
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
attempt
to
justify
himself
to
her
;
and
only
required
that
his
over
-
courteous
little
visitor
of
former
days
should
let
him
know
whenever
the
girl
might
happen
to
leave
her
new
situation
.
  
<EOS>
The
admirers
of
Father
Rocco
,
seeing
the
alteration
in
his
life
,
and
the
increased
quietness
of
his
manner
,
said
that
,
as
he
was
growing
older
,
he
was
getting
more
and
more
above
the
things
of
this
world
.
<EOS>
His
enemies
(
for
even
Father
Rocco
had
them
)
did
not
scruple
to
assert
that
the
change
in
him
was
decidedly
for
the
worse
,
and
that
he
belonged
to
the
order
of
men
who
are
most
to
be
distrusted
when
they
become
most
subdued
.
<EOS>
The
priest
himself
paid
no
attention
either
to
his
eulogists
or
his
depreciators
.
<EOS>
Nothing
disturbed
the
regularity
and
discipline
of
his
daily
habits
;
and
vigilant
Scandal
,
though
she
sought
often
to
surprise
him
,
sought
always
in
vain
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
Father
Rocco
's
life
from
the
period
of
his
niece
's
death
to
Fabio
's
return
to
Pisa
.
  
<EOS>
As
a
matter
of
course
,
the
priest
was
one
of
the
first
to
call
at
the
palace
and
welcome
the
young
nobleman
back
.
<EOS>
What
passed
between
them
at
this
interview
never
was
precisely
known
;
but
it
was
surmised
readily
enough
that
some
misunderstanding
had
taken
place
,
for
Father
Rocco
did
not
repeat
his
visit
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
complaints
of
Fabio
,
but
simply
stated
that
he
had
said
something
,
intended
for
the
young
man
's
good
,
which
had
not
been
received
in
a
right
spirit
;
and
that
he
thought
it
desirable
to
avoid
the
painful
chance
of
any
further
collision
by
not
presenting
himself
at
the
palace
again
for
some
little
time
.
<EOS>
People
were
rather
amazed
at
this
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
been
still
more
surprised
if
the
subject
of
the
masked
ball
had
not
just
then
occupied
all
their
attention
,
and
prevented
their
noticing
it
,
by
another
strange
event
in
connection
with
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
,
some
weeks
after
the
cessation
of
his
intercourse
with
Fabio
,
returned
one
morning
to
his
old
way
of
life
as
a
sculptor
,
and
opened
the
long
-
closed
doors
of
his
brother
's
studio
.
  
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
's
former
workmen
,
discovering
this
,
applied
to
him
immediately
for
employment
;
but
were
informed
that
their
services
would
not
be
needed
.
<EOS>
Visitors
called
at
the
studio
,
but
were
always
sent
away
again
by
the
disappointing
announcement
that
there
was
nothing
new
to
show
them
.
<EOS>
So
the
days
passed
on
until
Nanina
left
her
situation
and
returned
to
Pisa
.
<EOS>
This
circumstance
was
duly
reported
to
Father
Rocco
by
his
correspondent
at
Florence
;
but
,
whether
he
was
too
much
occupied
among
the
statues
,
or
whether
it
was
one
result
of
his
cautious
resolution
never
to
expose
himself
unnecessarily
to
so
much
as
the
breath
of
detraction
,
he
made
no
attempt
to
see
Nanina
,
or
even
to
justify
himself
toward
her
by
writing
her
a
letter
.
<EOS>
All
his
mornings
continued
to
be
spent
alone
in
the
studio
,
and
all
his
afternoons
to
be
occupied
by
his
clerical
duties
,
until
the
day
before
the
masked
ball
at
the
Melani
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
Early
on
that
day
he
covered
over
the
statues
,
and
locked
the
doors
of
the
work
-
rooms
once
more
;
then
returned
to
his
own
lodgings
,
and
did
not
go
out
again
.
<EOS>
One
or
two
of
his
friends
who
wanted
to
see
him
were
informed
that
he
was
not
well
enough
to
be
able
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
penetrated
into
his
little
study
,
and
had
seen
him
,
they
would
have
been
easily
satisfied
that
this
was
no
mere
excuse
.
<EOS>
They
would
have
noticed
that
his
face
was
startlingly
pale
,
and
that
the
ordinary
composure
of
his
manner
was
singularly
disturbed
.
  
<EOS>
Toward
evening
this
restlessness
increased
,
and
his
old
housekeeper
,
on
pressing
him
to
take
some
nourishment
,
was
astonished
to
hear
him
answer
her
sharply
and
irritably
,
for
the
first
time
since
she
had
been
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
A
little
later
her
surprise
was
increased
by
his
sending
her
with
a
note
to
the
Ascoli
Palace
,
and
by
the
quick
return
of
an
answer
,
brought
ceremoniously
by
one
of
Fabio
's
servants
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
long
since
he
has
had
any
communication
with
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Are
they
going
to
be
friends
again
?
<EOS>
"
thought
the
housekeeper
as
she
took
the
answer
upstairs
to
her
master
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
feel
better
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
as
he
read
it
;
"
well
enough
indeed
to
venture
out
.
<EOS>
If
any
one
inquires
for
me
,
tell
them
that
I
am
gone
to
the
Ascoli
Palace
.
"
<EOS>
Saying
this
,
he
walked
to
the
door
;
then
returned
,
and
trying
the
lock
of
his
cabinet
,
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
properly
secured
;
then
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
Fabio
in
one
of
the
large
drawing
-
rooms
of
the
palace
,
walking
irritably
backward
and
forward
,
with
several
little
notes
crumpled
together
in
his
hands
,
and
a
plain
black
domino
dress
for
the
masquerade
of
the
ensuing
night
spread
out
on
one
of
the
tables
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
was
just
going
to
write
to
you
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
abruptly
,
"
when
I
received
your
letter
.
<EOS>
You
offer
me
a
renewal
of
our
friendship
,
and
I
accept
the
offer
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
those
references
of
yours
,
when
we
last
met
,
to
the
subject
of
second
marriages
were
well
meant
,
but
they
irritated
me
;
and
,
speaking
under
that
irritation
<EOS>
,
I
said
words
that
I
had
better
not
have
spoken
.
<EOS>
If
I
pained
you
,
I
am
sorry
for
it
.
<EOS>
Wait
!
<EOS>
pardon
me
for
one
moment
.
<EOS>
I
have
not
quite
done
yet
.
<EOS>
It
seems
that
you
are
by
no
means
the
only
person
in
Pisa
to
whom
the
question
of
my
possibly
marrying
again
appears
to
have
presented
itself
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
it
was
known
that
I
intended
to
renew
my
intercourse
with
society
at
the
ball
to
-
morrow
night
,
I
have
been
persecuted
by
anonymous
letters
 
infamous
letters
,
written
from
some
motive
which
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
understand
.
<EOS>
I
want
your
advice
on
the
best
means
of
discovering
the
writers
;
and
I
have
also
a
very
important
question
to
ask
you
.
<EOS>
But
read
one
of
the
letters
first
yourself
;
any
one
will
do
as
a
sample
of
the
rest
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fixing
his
eyes
searchingly
on
the
priest
,
he
handed
him
one
of
the
notes
.
<EOS>
Still
a
little
paler
than
usual
,
Father
Rocco
sat
down
by
the
nearest
lamp
,
and
shading
his
eyes
,
read
these
lines
:
  
"
<EOS>
COUNT
FABIO
 
<EOS>
It
is
the
common
talk
of
Pisa
that
you
are
likely
,
as
a
young
man
left
with
a
motherless
child
,
to
marry
again
.
<EOS>
Your
having
accepted
an
invitation
to
the
Melani
Palace
gives
a
color
of
truth
to
this
report
.
<EOS>
Widowers
who
are
true
to
the
departed
do
not
go
among
all
the
handsomest
single
women
in
a
city
at
a
masked
ball
.
<EOS>
Reconsider
your
determination
,
and
remain
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
,
and
I
knew
your
wife
,
and
I
say
to
you
solemnly
,
avoid
temptation
,
for
you
must
never
marry
again
.
<EOS>
Neglect
my
advice
and
you
will
repent
it
to
the
end
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
I
have
reasons
for
what
I
say
 
<EOS>
serious
,
fatal
reasons
,
which
I
can
not
divulge
.
<EOS>
If
you
would
let
your
wife
lie
easy
in
her
grave
,
if
you
would
avoid
a
terrible
warning
,
go
not
to
the
masked
ball
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ask
you
,
and
I
ask
any
man
,
if
that
is
not
infamous
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Fabio
,
passionately
,
as
the
priest
handed
him
back
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
attempt
to
work
on
my
fears
through
the
memory
of
my
poor
dead
wife
!
<EOS>
An
insolent
assumption
that
I
want
to
marry
again
,
when
I
myself
have
not
even
so
much
as
thought
of
the
subject
at
all
!
<EOS>
What
is
the
secret
object
of
this
letter
,
and
of
the
rest
here
that
resemble
it
?
<EOS>
Whose
interest
is
it
to
keep
me
away
from
the
ball
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
meaning
of
such
a
phrase
as
,
"
If
you
would
let
your
wife
lie
easy
in
her
grave
'
?
<EOS>
Have
you
no
advice
to
give
me
 
no
plan
to
propose
for
discovering
the
vile
hand
that
traced
these
lines
?
<EOS>
Speak
to
me
!
<EOS>
Why
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
do
n't
you
speak
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
priest
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
,
and
,
turning
his
face
from
the
light
as
if
it
dazzled
his
eyes
,
replied
in
his
lowest
and
quietest
tones
:
  
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
speak
till
I
have
had
time
to
think
.
<EOS>
The
mystery
of
that
letter
is
not
to
be
solved
in
a
moment
.
<EOS>
There
are
things
in
it
that
are
enough
to
perplex
and
amaze
any
man
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
things
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
go
into
details
 
at
least
at
the
present
moment
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
speak
with
a
strange
air
of
secrecy
.
<EOS>
Have
you
nothing
definite
to
say
 
no
advice
to
give
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
should
advise
you
not
to
go
to
the
ball
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
would
!
<EOS>
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
I
gave
you
my
reasons
,
I
am
afraid
I
should
only
be
irritating
you
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
Rocco
,
neither
your
words
nor
your
manner
satisfy
me
.
<EOS>
You
speak
in
riddles
;
and
you
sit
there
in
the
dark
with
your
face
hidden
from
me
"
  
<EOS>
The
priest
instantly
started
up
and
turned
his
face
to
the
light
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
recommend
you
to
control
your
temper
,
and
to
treat
me
with
common
courtesy
,
"
he
said
,
in
his
quietest
,
firmest
tones
,
looking
at
Fabio
steadily
while
he
spoke
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
prolong
this
interview
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
calming
himself
by
an
evident
effort
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
one
question
to
ask
you
,
and
then
no
more
to
say
.
"
  
The
priest
bowed
his
head
,
in
token
that
he
was
ready
to
listen
.
<EOS>
He
still
stood
up
,
calm
,
pale
,
and
firm
,
in
the
full
light
of
the
lamp
.
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
just
possible
,
"
continued
Fabio
,
"
that
these
letters
may
refer
to
some
incautious
words
which
my
late
wife
might
have
spoken
.
<EOS>
I
ask
you
as
her
spiritual
director
,
and
as
a
near
relation
who
enjoyed
her
confidence
,
if
you
ever
heard
her
express
a
wish
,
in
the
event
of
my
surviving
her
,
that
I
should
abstain
from
marrying
again
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
never
express
such
a
wish
to
you
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Never
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
you
evade
my
question
by
asking
me
another
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
for
me
to
reply
to
your
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
For
what
reason
?
"
  
"
Because
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
give
answers
which
must
refer
,
whether
they
are
affirmative
or
negative
,
to
what
I
have
heard
in
confession
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
have
spoken
enough
,
"
said
Fabio
,
turning
angrily
from
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
you
to
help
me
in
clearing
up
these
mysteries
,
and
you
do
your
best
to
thicken
them
.
<EOS>
What
your
motives
are
,
what
your
conduct
means
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
know
,
but
I
say
to
you
,
what
I
would
say
in
far
other
terms
,
if
they
were
here
,
to
the
villains
who
have
written
these
letters
 
no
menaces
,
no
mysteries
,
no
conspiracies
,
will
prevent
me
from
being
at
the
ball
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
I
can
listen
to
persuasion
,
but
I
scorn
threats
.
<EOS>
There
lies
my
dress
for
the
masquerade
;
no
power
on
earth
shall
prevent
me
from
wearing
it
to
-
morrow
night
!
"
<EOS>
He
pointed
,
as
he
spoke
,
to
the
black
domino
and
half
-
mask
lying
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
power
on
earth
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Father
Rocco
,
with
a
smile
,
and
an
emphasis
on
the
last
word
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Superstitious
still
,
Count
Fabio
!
<EOS>
Do
you
suspect
the
powers
of
the
other
world
of
interfering
with
mortals
at
masquerades
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
started
,
and
,
turning
from
the
table
,
fixed
his
eyes
intently
on
the
priest
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
suggested
just
now
that
we
had
better
not
prolong
this
interview
,
"
said
Father
Rocco
,
still
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
were
right
;
if
we
part
at
once
,
we
may
still
part
friends
.
<EOS>
You
have
had
my
advice
not
to
go
to
the
ball
,
and
you
decline
following
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
nothing
more
to
say
.
<EOS>
Good
-
night
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Fabio
could
utter
the
angry
rejoinder
that
rose
to
his
lips
,
the
door
of
the
room
had
opened
and
closed
again
,
and
the
priest
was
gone
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
night
,
at
the
time
of
assembling
specified
in
the
invitations
to
the
masked
ball
,
Fabio
was
still
lingering
in
his
palace
,
and
still
allowing
the
black
domino
to
lie
untouched
and
unheeded
on
his
dressing
-
table
.
<EOS>
This
delay
was
not
produced
by
any
change
in
his
resolution
to
go
to
the
Melani
Palace
.
<EOS>
His
determination
to
be
present
at
the
ball
remained
unshaken
;
and
yet
,
at
the
last
moment
,
he
lingered
and
lingered
on
,
without
knowing
why
.
<EOS>
Some
strange
influence
seemed
to
be
keeping
him
within
the
walls
of
his
lonely
home
.
<EOS>
It
was
as
if
the
great
,
empty
,
silent
palace
had
almost
recovered
on
that
night
the
charm
which
it
had
lost
when
its
mistress
died
.
  
<EOS>
He
left
his
own
apartment
and
went
to
the
bedroom
where
his
infant
child
lay
asleep
in
her
little
crib
.
<EOS>
He
sat
watching
her
,
and
thinking
quietly
and
tenderly
of
many
past
events
in
his
life
for
a
long
time
,
then
returned
to
his
room
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
sense
of
loneliness
came
upon
him
after
his
visit
to
the
child
's
bedside
;
but
he
did
not
attempt
to
raise
his
spirits
even
then
by
going
to
the
ball
.
<EOS>
He
descended
instead
to
his
study
,
lighted
his
reading
-
lamp
,
and
then
,
opening
a
bureau
,
took
from
one
of
the
drawers
in
it
the
letter
which
Nanina
had
written
to
him
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
first
time
that
a
sudden
sense
of
his
solitude
had
connected
itself
inexplicably
with
the
remembrance
of
the
work
-
girl
's
letter
.
  
<EOS>
He
read
it
through
slowly
,
and
when
he
had
done
,
kept
it
open
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
youth
,
titles
,
wealth
,
"
he
thought
to
himself
,
sadly
;
"
everything
that
is
sought
after
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
And
yet
if
I
try
to
think
of
any
human
being
who
really
and
truly
loves
me
,
I
can
remember
but
one
 
the
poor
,
faithful
girl
who
wrote
these
lines
!
"
  
<EOS>
Old
recollections
of
the
first
day
when
he
met
with
Nanina
,
of
the
first
sitting
she
had
given
him
in
Luca
Lomi
's
studio
,
of
the
first
visit
to
the
neat
little
room
in
the
by
-
street
,
began
to
rise
more
and
more
vividly
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Entirely
absorbed
by
them
,
he
sat
absently
drawing
with
pen
and
ink
,
on
some
sheets
of
letter
-
paper
lying
under
his
hand
,
lines
and
circles
,
and
fragments
of
decorations
,
and
vague
remembrances
of
old
ideas
for
statues
,
until
the
sudden
sinking
of
the
flame
of
his
lamp
awoke
his
attention
abruptly
to
present
things
.
  
<EOS>
He
looked
at
his
watch
.
<EOS>
It
was
close
on
midnight
.
  
<EOS>
This
discovery
at
last
aroused
him
to
the
necessity
of
immediate
departure
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
he
had
put
on
his
domino
and
mask
,
and
was
on
his
way
to
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
Before
he
reached
the
Melani
Palace
the
first
part
of
the
entertainment
had
come
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
The
"
Toy
Symphony
"
had
been
played
,
the
grotesque
dance
performed
,
amid
universal
laughter
;
and
now
the
guests
were
,
for
the
most
part
,
fortifying
themselves
in
the
Arcadian
bowers
for
new
dances
,
in
which
all
persons
present
were
expected
to
take
part
.
<EOS>
The
Marquis
Melani
had
,
with
characteristic
oddity
,
divided
his
two
classical
refreshment
-
rooms
into
what
he
termed
the
Light
and
Heavy
Departments
.
<EOS>
Fruit
,
pastry
,
sweetmeats
,
salads
,
and
harmless
drinks
were
included
under
the
first
head
,
and
all
the
stimulating
liquors
and
solid
eatables
under
the
last
.
<EOS>
The
thirty
shepherdesses
had
been
,
according
to
the
marquis
's
order
,
equally
divided
at
the
outset
of
the
evening
between
the
two
rooms
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
company
began
to
crowd
more
and
more
resolutely
in
the
direction
of
the
Heavy
Department
,
ten
of
the
shepherdesses
attached
to
the
Light
Department
were
told
off
to
assist
in
attending
on
the
hungry
and
thirsty
majority
of
guests
who
were
not
to
be
appeased
by
pastry
and
lemonade
.
<EOS>
Among
the
five
girls
who
were
left
behind
in
the
room
for
the
light
refreshments
was
Nanina
.
<EOS>
The
steward
soon
discovered
that
the
novelty
of
her
situation
made
her
really
nervous
,
and
he
wisely
concluded
that
if
he
trusted
her
where
the
crowd
was
greatest
and
the
noise
loudest
,
she
would
not
only
be
utterly
useless
,
but
also
very
much
in
the
way
of
her
more
confident
and
experienced
companions
.
  
<EOS>
When
Fabio
arrived
at
the
palace
,
the
jovial
uproar
in
the
Heavy
Department
was
at
its
height
,
and
several
gentlemen
,
fired
by
the
classical
costumes
of
the
shepherdesses
,
were
beginning
to
speak
Latin
to
them
with
a
thick
utterance
,
and
a
valorous
contempt
for
all
restrictions
of
gender
,
number
,
and
case
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
could
escape
from
the
congratulations
on
his
return
to
his
friends
,
which
poured
on
him
from
all
sides
,
Fabio
withdrew
to
seek
some
quieter
room
.
<EOS>
The
heat
,
noise
,
and
confusion
had
so
bewildered
him
,
after
the
tranquil
life
he
had
been
leading
for
many
months
past
,
that
it
 
was
quite
a
relief
to
stroll
through
the
half
deserted
dancing
-
rooms
,
to
the
opposite
extremity
of
the
great
suite
of
apartments
,
and
there
to
find
himself
in
a
second
Arcadian
bower
,
which
seemed
peaceful
enough
to
deserve
its
name
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
guests
were
in
this
room
when
he
first
entered
it
,
but
the
distant
sound
of
some
first
notes
of
dance
music
drew
them
all
away
.
<EOS>
After
a
careless
look
at
the
quaint
decorations
about
him
,
he
sat
down
alone
on
a
divan
near
the
door
,
and
beginning
already
to
feel
the
heat
and
discomfort
of
his
mask
,
took
it
off
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
removed
it
more
than
a
moment
before
he
heard
a
faint
cry
in
the
direction
of
a
long
refreshment
-
table
,
behind
which
the
five
waiting
-
girls
were
standing
.
<EOS>
He
started
up
directly
,
and
could
hardly
believe
his
senses
,
when
he
found
himself
standing
face
to
face
with
Nanina
.
  
<EOS>
Her
cheeks
had
turned
perfectly
colorless
.
<EOS>
Her
astonishment
at
seeing
the
young
nobleman
appeared
to
have
some
sensation
of
terror
mingled
with
it
.
<EOS>
The
waiting
-
woman
who
happened
to
stand
by
her
side
instinctively
stretched
out
an
arm
to
support
her
,
observing
that
she
caught
at
the
edge
of
the
table
as
Fabio
hurried
round
to
get
behind
it
and
speak
to
her
.
<EOS>
When
he
drew
near
,
her
head
drooped
on
her
breast
,
and
she
said
,
faintly
:
"
I
never
knew
you
were
at
Pisa
;
I
never
thought
you
would
be
here
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
I
am
true
to
what
I
said
in
my
letter
,
though
I
seem
so
false
to
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
speak
to
you
about
the
letter
 
to
tell
you
how
carefully
I
have
kept
it
<EOS>
,
how
often
I
have
read
it
,
"
said
Fabio
.
  
<EOS>
She
turned
away
her
head
,
and
tried
hard
to
repress
the
tears
that
would
force
their
way
into
her
eyes
<EOS>
"
We
should
never
have
met
,
"
she
said
;
"
never
,
never
have
met
again
!
"
  
<EOS>
Before
Fabio
could
reply
,
the
waiting
-
woman
by
Nanina
's
side
interposed
.
  
<EOS>
"
For
Heaven
's
sake
,
do
n't
stop
speaking
to
her
here
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
If
the
steward
or
one
of
the
upper
servants
was
to
come
in
,
you
would
get
her
into
dreadful
trouble
.
<EOS>
Wait
till
to
-
morrow
,
and
find
some
fitter
place
than
this
.
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
felt
the
justice
of
the
reproof
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
tore
a
leaf
out
of
his
pocketbook
,
and
wrote
on
it
,
"
I
must
tell
you
how
I
honor
and
thank
you
for
that
letter
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
 
ten
o'clock
 
<EOS>
the
wicket
-
gate
at
the
back
of
the
Ascoli
gardens
.
<EOS>
Believe
in
my
truth
and
honor
,
Nanina
,
for
I
believe
implicitly
in
yours
.
"
<EOS>
Having
written
these
lines
,
he
took
from
among
his
bunch
of
watch
-
seals
a
little
key
,
wrapped
it
up
in
the
note
,
and
pressed
it
into
her
hand
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
himself
his
fingers
lingered
round
hers
,
and
he
was
on
the
point
of
speaking
to
her
again
,
when
he
saw
the
waiting
-
woman
's
hand
,
which
was
just
raised
to
motion
him
away
,
suddenly
drop
.
<EOS>
Her
color
changed
at
the
same
moment
,
and
she
looked
fixedly
across
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
round
immediately
,
and
saw
a
masked
woman
standing
alone
in
the
room
,
dressed
entirely
in
yellow
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
yellow
hood
,
a
yellow
half
-
mask
with
deep
fringe
hanging
down
over
her
mouth
,
and
a
yellow
domino
,
cut
at
the
sleeves
and
edges
into
long
flame
-
shaped
points
,
which
waved
backward
and
forward
tremulously
in
the
light
air
wafted
through
the
doorway
.
<EOS>
The
woman
's
black
eyes
seemed
to
gleam
with
an
evil
brightness
through
the
sight
-
holes
of
the
mask
,
and
the
tawny
fringe
hanging
before
her
mouth
fluttered
slowly
with
every
breath
she
drew
.
<EOS>
Without
a
word
or
a
gesture
she
stood
before
the
table
,
and
her
gleaming
black
eyes
fixed
steadily
on
Fabio
the
instant
he
confronted
her
.
<EOS>
A
sudden
chill
struck
through
him
,
as
he
observed
that
the
yellow
of
the
stranger
's
domino
and
mask
was
of
precisely
the
same
shade
as
the
yellow
of
the
hangings
and
furniture
which
his
wife
had
chosen
after
their
marriage
for
the
decoration
of
her
favorite
sitting
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Yellow
Mask
!
"
whispered
the
waiting
-
girls
nervously
,
crowding
together
behind
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Yellow
Mask
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Make
her
speak
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ask
her
to
have
something
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
This
gentleman
will
ask
her
.
<EOS>
Speak
to
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Do
speak
to
her
!
<EOS>
She
glides
about
in
that
fearful
yellow
dress
like
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
looked
around
mechanically
at
the
girl
who
was
whispering
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
saw
at
the
same
time
that
Nanina
still
kept
her
head
turned
away
,
and
that
she
had
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
She
was
evidently
struggling
yet
with
the
agitation
produced
by
their
unexpected
meeting
,
and
was
,
most
probably
for
that
reason
,
the
only
person
in
the
room
not
conscious
of
the
presence
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
"
Speak
to
her
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Do
speak
to
her
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
two
of
the
waiting
-
girls
together
.
  
<EOS>
Fabio
turned
again
toward
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
black
eyes
were
still
gleaming
at
him
from
behind
the
tawny
yellow
of
the
mask
.
<EOS>
He
nodded
to
the
girls
who
had
just
spoken
,
cast
one
farewell
look
at
Nanina
,
and
moved
down
the
room
to
get
round
to
the
side
of
the
table
at
which
the
Yellow
Mask
was
standing
.
<EOS>
Step
by
step
as
he
moved
the
bright
eyes
followed
him
.
<EOS>
Steadily
and
more
steadily
their
evil
light
seemed
to
shine
through
and
through
him
,
as
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
table
and
approached
the
still
,
spectral
figure
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
close
up
to
the
woman
,
but
she
never
moved
;
her
eyes
never
wavered
for
an
instant
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
and
tried
to
speak
;
but
the
chill
struck
through
him
again
.
<EOS>
An
overpowering
dread
,
an
unutterable
loathing
seized
on
him
;
all
sense
of
outer
things
 
the
whispering
of
the
waiting
-
girls
behind
the
table
,
the
gentle
cadence
of
the
dance
music
,
the
distant
hum
of
joyous
talk
 
suddenly
left
him
.
<EOS>
He
turned
away
shuddering
,
and
quitted
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
Following
the
sound
of
the
music
,
and
desiring
before
all
things
now
to
join
the
crowd
wherever
it
was
largest
,
he
was
stopped
in
one
of
the
smaller
apartments
by
a
gentleman
who
had
just
risen
from
the
card
table
,
and
who
held
out
his
hand
with
the
cordiality
of
an
old
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Welcome
back
to
the
world
,
Count
Fabio
!
"
<EOS>
he
began
,
gayly
,
then
suddenly
checked
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
you
look
pale
,
and
your
hand
feels
cold
.
<EOS>
Not
ill
,
I
hope
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
rather
startled
 
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
say
why
 
by
a
very
strangely
dressed
woman
,
who
fairly
stared
me
out
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
do
n't
mean
the
Yellow
Mask
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
I
do
.
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
her
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Everybody
has
seen
her
;
but
nobody
can
make
her
unmask
,
or
get
her
to
speak
.
<EOS>
Our
host
has
not
the
slightest
notion
who
she
is
;
and
our
hostess
is
horribly
frightened
at
her
.
<EOS>
For
my
part
,
I
think
she
has
given
us
quite
enough
of
her
mystery
and
her
grim
dress
;
and
if
my
name
,
instead
of
being
nothing
but
plain
Andrea
D'Arbino
,
was
Marquis
Melani
,
I
would
say
to
her
:
"
Madam
,
we
are
here
to
laugh
and
amuse
ourselves
;
suppose
you
open
your
lips
,
and
charm
us
by
appearing
in
a
prettier
dress
!
"
<EOS>
"
  
During
this
conversation
they
had
sat
down
together
,
with
their
backs
toward
the
door
,
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
card
-
tables
.
<EOS>
While
D'Arbino
was
speaking
,
Fabio
suddenly
felt
himself
shuddering
again
,
and
became
conscious
of
a
sound
of
low
breathing
behind
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
turned
round
instantly
,
and
there
,
standing
between
them
,
and
peering
down
at
them
,
was
the
Yellow
Mask
!
  
<EOS>
Fabio
started
up
,
and
his
friend
followed
his
example
.
<EOS>
Again
the
gleaming
black
eyes
rested
steadily
on
the
young
nobleman
's
face
,
and
again
their
look
chilled
him
to
the
heart
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yellow
Lady
,
do
you
know
my
friend
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
D'Arbino
,
with
mock
solemnity
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
fatal
eyes
never
moved
from
Fabio
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yellow
Lady
,
"
continued
the
other
,
"
listen
to
the
music
.
<EOS>
Will
you
dance
with
me
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
eyes
looked
away
,
and
the
figure
glided
slowly
from
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
count
,
"
said
D'Arbino
,
"
that
woman
seems
to
have
quite
an
effect
on
you
.
<EOS>
I
declare
she
has
left
you
paler
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Come
into
the
supper
-
room
with
me
,
and
have
some
wine
;
you
really
look
as
if
you
wanted
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
They
went
at
once
to
the
large
refreshment
-
room
.
<EOS>
Nearly
all
the
guests
had
by
this
time
begun
to
dance
again
.
<EOS>
They
had
the
whole
apartment
,
therefore
,
almost
entirely
to
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Among
the
decorations
of
the
room
,
which
were
not
strictly
in
accordance
with
genuine
Arcadian
simplicity
,
was
a
large
looking
-
glass
,
placed
over
a
well
-
furnished
sideboard
.
<EOS>
D'Arbino
led
Fabio
in
this
direction
,
exchanging
greetings
as
he
advanced
with
a
gentleman
who
stood
near
the
glass
looking
into
it
,
and
carelessly
fanning
himself
with
his
mask
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
friend
!
"
<EOS>
cried
D'Arbino
,
"
you
are
the
very
man
to
lead
us
straight
to
the
best
bottle
of
wine
in
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Count
Fabio
,
let
me
present
to
you
<EOS>
my
intimate
and
good
friend
,
the
Cavaliere
Finello
,
with
whose
family
<EOS>
I
know
you
are
well
acquainted
.
<EOS>
Finello
,
the
count
is
a
little
out
of
spirits
,
and
I
have
prescribed
a
good
dose
of
wine
.
<EOS>
I
see
a
whole
row
of
bottles
at
your
side
,
and
I
leave
it
to
you
to
apply
the
remedy
.
<EOS>
Glasses
there
!
<EOS>
three
glasses
,
my
lovely
shepherdess
with
the
black
eyes
 
<EOS>
the
three
largest
you
have
got
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
glasses
were
brought
;
the
Cavaliere
Finello
chose
a
particular
bottle
,
and
filled
them
.
<EOS>
All
three
gentlemen
turned
round
to
the
sideboard
to
use
it
as
a
table
,
and
thus
necessarily
faced
the
looking
-
glass
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
let
us
drink
the
toast
of
toasts
,
"
said
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
Finello
,
Count
Fabio
 
the
ladies
of
Pisa
!
"
  
Fabio
raised
the
wine
to
his
lips
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
drinking
it
,
when
he
saw
reflected
in
the
glass
the
figure
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
The
glittering
eyes
were
again
fixed
on
him
,
and
the
yellow
-
hooded
head
bowed
slowly
,
as
if
in
acknowledgment
of
the
toast
he
was
about
to
drink
.
<EOS>
For
the
third
time
the
strange
chill
seized
him
,
and
he
set
down
his
glass
of
wine
untasted
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
is
the
matter
?
"
asked
D'Arbino
.
  
<EOS>
"
Have
you
any
dislike
,
count
,
to
that
particular
wine
?
"
inquired
the
cavaliere
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Yellow
Mask
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
Fabio
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Yellow
Mask
again
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
all
three
turned
round
directly
toward
the
door
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
 
<EOS>
the
figure
had
disappeared
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
any
one
know
who
this
Yellow
Mask
is
?
"
asked
Finello
.
<EOS>
"
One
may
guess
by
the
walk
that
the
figure
is
a
woman
's
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
may
be
the
strange
color
she
has
chosen
for
her
dress
,
or
perhaps
her
stealthy
way
of
moving
from
room
to
room
;
but
there
is
certainly
something
mysterious
and
startling
about
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Startling
enough
,
as
the
count
would
tell
you
,
"
said
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Yellow
Mask
has
been
responsible
for
his
loss
of
spirits
and
change
of
complexion
,
and
now
she
has
prevented
him
even
from
drinking
his
wine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
account
for
it
,
"
said
Fabio
,
looking
round
him
uneasily
;
"
but
this
is
the
third
room
into
which
she
has
followed
me
 
the
third
time
she
has
seemed
to
fix
her
eyes
on
me
alone
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
my
nerves
are
hardly
in
a
fit
state
yet
for
masked
balls
and
adventures
;
the
sight
of
her
seems
to
chill
me
.
<EOS>
Who
can
she
be
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
If
she
followed
me
a
fourth
time
,
"
said
Finello
,
"
I
should
insist
on
her
unmasking
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
suppose
she
refused
?
"
asked
his
friend
  
"
Then
I
should
take
her
mask
off
for
her
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
impossible
to
do
that
with
a
woman
,
"
said
Fabio
.
<EOS>
"
I
prefer
trying
to
lose
her
in
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
,
gentlemen
,
if
I
leave
you
to
finish
the
wine
,
and
then
to
meet
me
,
if
you
like
,
in
the
great
ballroom
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
retired
as
he
spoke
,
put
on
his
mask
,
and
joined
the
dancers
immediately
,
taking
care
to
keep
always
in
the
most
crowded
corner
of
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
this
plan
of
action
proved
successful
,
and
he
saw
no
more
of
the
mysterious
yellow
domino
.
<EOS>
Ere
long
,
however
,
some
new
dances
were
arranged
,
in
which
the
great
majority
of
the
persons
in
the
ballroom
took
part
;
the
figures
resembling
the
old
English
country
dances
in
this
respect
,
that
the
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
placed
in
long
rows
opposite
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
sets
consisted
of
about
twenty
couples
each
,
placed
sometimes
across
,
and
sometimes
along
the
apartment
;
and
the
spectators
were
all
required
to
move
away
on
either
side
,
and
range
themselves
close
to
the
walls
.
<EOS>
As
Fabio
among
others
complied
with
this
necessity
,
he
looked
down
a
row
of
dancers
waiting
during
the
performance
of
the
orchestral
prelude
;
and
there
,
watching
him
again
,
from
the
opposite
end
of
the
lane
formed
by
the
gentlemen
on
one
side
and
the
ladies
on
the
other
,
he
saw
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
He
moved
abruptly
back
,
toward
another
row
of
dancers
,
placed
at
right
angles
to
the
first
row
;
and
there
again
;
at
the
opposite
end
of
the
gay
lane
of
brightly
-
dressed
figures
,
was
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
He
slipped
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
but
it
was
only
to
find
her
occupying
his
former
position
near
the
wall
,
and
still
,
in
spite
of
his
disguise
,
watching
him
through
row
after
row
of
dancers
.
<EOS>
The
persecution
began
to
grow
intolerable
;
he
felt
a
kind
of
angry
curiosity
mingling
now
with
the
vague
dread
that
had
hitherto
oppressed
him
.
<EOS>
Finello
's
advice
recurred
to
his
memory
;
and
he
determined
to
make
the
woman
unmask
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
With
this
intention
he
returned
to
the
supper
-
room
in
which
he
had
left
his
friends
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
gone
,
probably
to
the
ballroom
,
to
look
for
him
.
<EOS>
Plenty
of
wine
was
still
left
on
the
sideboard
,
and
he
poured
himself
out
a
glass
.
<EOS>
Finding
that
his
hand
trembled
as
he
did
so
,
he
drank
several
more
glasses
in
quick
succession
,
to
nerve
himself
for
the
approaching
encounter
with
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
drinking
he
expected
every
moment
to
see
her
in
the
looking
-
glass
again
;
but
she
never
appeared
 
<EOS>
and
yet
he
felt
almost
certain
that
he
had
detected
her
gliding
out
after
him
when
he
left
the
ballroom
.
  
<EOS>
He
thought
it
possible
that
she
might
be
waiting
for
him
in
one
of
the
smaller
apartments
,
and
,
taking
off
his
mask
,
walked
through
several
of
them
without
meeting
her
,
until
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
refreshment
-
room
in
which
Nanina
and
he
had
recognized
each
other
.
<EOS>
The
waiting
-
woman
behind
the
table
,
who
had
first
spoken
to
him
,
caught
sight
of
him
now
,
and
ran
round
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
come
in
and
speak
to
Nanina
again
,
"
she
said
,
mistaking
the
purpose
which
had
brought
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
What
with
frightening
her
first
,
and
making
her
cry
afterward
,
you
have
rendered
her
quite
unfit
for
her
work
.
<EOS>
The
steward
is
in
there
at
this
moment
,
very
good
-
natured
,
but
not
very
sober
.
<EOS>
He
says
she
is
pale
and
red
-
eyed
,
and
not
fit
to
be
a
shepherdess
any
longer
,
and
that
,
as
she
will
not
be
missed
now
,
she
may
go
home
if
she
likes
.
<EOS>
We
have
got
her
an
old
cloak
,
and
she
is
going
to
try
and
slip
through
the
rooms
unobserved
,
to
get
downstairs
and
change
her
dress
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
speak
to
her
,
pray
,
or
you
will
only
make
her
cry
again
;
and
what
is
worse
,
make
the
steward
fancy
"
  
<EOS>
She
stopped
at
that
last
word
,
and
pointed
suddenly
over
Fabio
's
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
Yellow
Mask
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
sir
,
draw
her
away
into
the
ballroom
,
and
give
Nanina
a
chance
of
getting
out
!
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
turned
directly
,
and
approached
the
Mask
,
who
,
as
they
looked
at
each
other
,
slowly
retreated
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
waiting
-
woman
,
seeing
the
yellow
figure
retire
,
hastened
back
to
Nanina
in
the
refreshment
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
the
masked
woman
retreated
from
one
apartment
to
another
till
she
entered
a
corridor
brilliantly
lighted
up
and
beautifully
ornamented
with
flowers
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
hand
this
corridor
led
to
the
ballroom
;
on
the
left
to
an
ante
-
chamber
at
the
head
of
the
palace
staircase
.
<EOS>
The
Yellow
Mask
went
on
a
few
paces
toward
the
left
,
then
stopped
.
<EOS>
The
bright
eyes
fixed
themselves
as
before
on
Fabio
's
face
,
but
only
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
He
heard
a
light
step
behind
him
,
and
then
he
saw
the
eyes
move
.
<EOS>
Following
the
direction
they
took
,
he
turned
round
,
and
discovered
Nanina
,
wrapped
up
in
the
old
cloak
which
was
to
enable
her
to
get
downstairs
unobserved
.
  
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
how
can
I
get
out
?
<EOS>
how
can
I
get
out
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
girl
,
shrinking
back
affrightedly
as
she
saw
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
way
,
"
said
Fabio
,
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
ballroom
.
<EOS>
"
Nobody
will
notice
you
in
the
cloak
;
it
will
only
be
thought
some
new
disguise
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
her
arm
as
he
spoke
,
to
reassure
her
,
and
continued
in
a
whisper
,
"
Do
n't
forget
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
hand
of
the
masked
woman
,
and
it
put
him
back
from
Nanina
.
  
<EOS>
In
spite
of
himself
,
he
trembled
at
her
touch
,
but
still
retained
presence
of
mind
enough
to
sign
to
the
girl
to
make
her
escape
.
<EOS>
With
a
look
of
eager
inquiry
in
the
direction
of
the
mask
,
and
a
half
suppressed
exclamation
of
terror
,
she
obeyed
him
,
and
hastened
away
toward
the
ballroom
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
alone
,
"
said
Fabio
,
confronting
the
gleaming
black
eyes
,
and
reaching
out
his
hand
resolutely
toward
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
"
Tell
me
who
you
are
,
and
why
you
follow
me
,
or
I
will
uncover
your
face
,
and
solve
the
mystery
for
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
woman
pushed
his
hand
aside
,
and
drew
back
a
few
paces
,
but
never
spoke
a
word
.
<EOS>
He
followed
her
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
an
instant
to
be
lost
,
for
just
then
the
sound
of
footsteps
hastily
approaching
the
corridor
became
audible
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
or
never
,
"
he
whispered
to
himself
,
and
snatched
at
the
mask
.
  
<EOS>
His
arm
was
again
thrust
aside
;
but
this
time
the
woman
raised
her
disengaged
hand
at
the
same
moment
,
and
removed
the
yellow
mask
.
  
<EOS>
The
lamps
shed
their
soft
light
full
on
her
face
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
face
of
his
dead
wife
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
Signor
Andrea
D'Arbino
,
searching
vainly
through
the
various
rooms
in
the
palace
for
Count
Fabio
d'Ascoli
,
and
trying
as
a
last
resource
,
the
corridor
leading
to
the
ballroom
and
grand
staircase
,
discovered
his
friend
lying
on
the
floor
in
a
swoon
,
without
any
living
creature
near
him
.
<EOS>
Determining
to
avoid
alarming
the
guests
,
if
possible
,
D'Arbino
first
sought
help
in
the
antechamber
.
<EOS>
He
found
there
the
marquis
's
valet
,
assisting
the
Cavaliere
Finello
(
who
was
just
taking
his
departure
)
to
put
on
his
cloak
.
  
<EOS>
While
Finello
and
his
friend
carried
Fabio
to
an
open
window
in
the
antechamber
,
the
valet
procured
some
iced
water
.
<EOS>
This
simple
remedy
,
and
the
change
of
atmosphere
,
proved
enough
to
restore
the
fainting
man
to
his
senses
,
but
hardly
 
as
it
seemed
to
his
friends
 
to
his
former
self
.
<EOS>
They
noticed
a
change
to
blankness
and
stillness
in
his
face
,
and
when
he
spoke
,
an
indescribable
alteration
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
found
you
in
a
room
in
the
corridor
,
"
said
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
What
made
you
faint
?
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
remember
?
<EOS>
Was
it
the
heat
?
"
  
<EOS>
Fabio
waited
for
a
moment
,
painfully
collecting
his
ideas
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
valet
,
and
Finello
signed
to
the
man
to
withdraw
.
  
<EOS>
"
Was
it
the
heat
?
"
repeated
D'Arbino
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
answered
Fabio
,
in
strangely
hushed
,
steady
tones
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
the
face
that
was
behind
the
yellow
mask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
was
the
face
of
my
dead
wife
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Your
dead
wife
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
When
the
mask
was
removed
I
saw
her
face
.
<EOS>
Not
as
I
remember
it
in
the
pride
of
her
youth
and
beauty
 
not
even
as
I
remember
her
on
her
sick
-
bed
 
<EOS>
but
as
I
remember
her
in
her
coffin
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Count
!
<EOS>
for
God
's
sake
,
rouse
yourself
!
<EOS>
Collect
your
thoughts
 
<EOS>
remember
where
you
are
 
and
free
your
mind
of
its
horrible
delusion
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Spare
me
all
remonstrances
;
I
am
not
fit
to
bear
them
.
<EOS>
My
life
has
only
one
object
now
 
the
pursuing
of
this
mystery
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
Will
you
help
me
?
<EOS>
I
am
scarcely
fit
to
act
for
myself
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
still
spoke
in
the
same
unnaturally
hushed
,
deliberate
tones
.
<EOS>
D'Arbino
and
Finello
exchanged
glances
behind
him
as
he
rose
from
the
sofa
on
which
he
had
hitherto
been
lying
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
will
help
you
in
everything
,
"
said
D'Arbino
,
soothingly
.
<EOS>
"
Trust
in
us
to
the
end
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
wish
to
do
first
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
The
figure
must
have
gone
through
this
room
.
<EOS>
Let
us
descend
the
staircase
and
ask
the
servants
if
they
have
seen
it
pass
.
"
  
<EOS>
(
Both
D'Arbino
and
Finello
remarked
that
he
did
not
say
her
.
)
  
<EOS>
They
inquired
down
to
the
very
courtyard
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
the
servants
had
seen
the
Yellow
Mask
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
resource
was
the
porter
at
the
outer
gate
.
<EOS>
They
applied
to
him
;
and
in
answer
to
their
questions
he
asserted
that
he
had
most
certainly
seen
a
lady
in
a
yellow
domino
and
mask
drive
away
,
about
half
an
hour
before
,
in
a
hired
coach
.
  
<EOS>
"
Should
you
remember
the
coachman
again
?
"
asked
D'Arbino
.
  
<EOS>
"
Perfectly
;
he
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
you
know
where
he
lives
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
Yes
;
as
well
as
I
know
where
I
do
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Any
reward
you
like
,
if
you
can
get
somebody
to
mind
your
lodge
,
and
can
take
us
to
that
house
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
they
were
following
the
porter
through
the
dark
,
silent
streets
.
<EOS>
"
We
had
better
try
the
stables
first
,
"
said
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
My
friend
,
the
coachman
,
will
hardly
have
had
time
to
do
more
than
set
the
lady
down
.
<EOS>
We
shall
most
likely
catch
him
just
putting
up
his
horses
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
porter
turned
out
to
be
right
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
stable
-
yard
,
they
found
that
the
empty
coach
had
just
driven
into
it
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
taking
home
a
lady
in
a
yellow
domino
from
the
masquerade
?
"
<EOS>
said
D'Arbino
,
putting
some
money
into
the
coachman
's
hand
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
sir
;
I
was
engaged
by
that
lady
for
the
evening
 
engaged
to
drive
her
to
the
ball
as
well
as
to
drive
her
home
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Where
did
you
take
her
from
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
From
a
very
extraordinary
place
 
from
the
gate
of
the
Campo
Santo
burial
-
ground
.
"
  
<EOS>
During
this
colloquy
,
Finello
and
D'Arbino
had
been
standing
with
Fabio
between
them
,
each
giving
him
an
arm
.
<EOS>
The
instant
the
last
answer
was
given
,
he
reeled
back
with
a
cry
of
horror
.
  
<EOS>
"
Where
have
you
taken
her
to
now
?
"
asked
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
He
looked
about
him
nervously
as
he
put
the
question
,
and
spoke
for
the
first
time
in
a
whisper
.
  
<EOS>
"
To
the
Campo
Santo
again
,
"
said
the
coachman
.
  
<EOS>
Fabio
suddenly
drew
his
arms
out
of
the
arms
of
his
friends
,
and
sank
to
his
knees
on
the
ground
,
hiding
his
face
.
<EOS>
From
some
broken
ejaculations
which
escaped
him
,
it
seemed
as
if
he
dreaded
that
his
senses
were
leaving
him
,
and
that
he
was
praying
to
be
preserved
in
his
right
mind
.
  
<EOS>
"
Why
is
he
so
violently
agitated
?
"
said
Finello
,
eagerly
,
to
his
friend
.
  
<EOS>
"
Hush
!
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
You
heard
him
say
that
when
he
saw
the
face
behind
the
yellow
mask
,
it
was
the
face
of
his
dead
wife
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Yes
.
<EOS>
But
what
then
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
His
wife
was
buried
in
the
Campo
Santo
.
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
Of
all
the
persons
who
had
been
present
,
in
any
capacity
,
at
the
Marquis
Melani
's
ball
,
the
earliest
riser
on
the
morning
after
it
was
Nanina
.
<EOS>
The
agitation
produced
by
the
strange
events
in
which
she
had
been
concerned
destroyed
the
very
idea
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
Through
the
hours
of
darkness
she
could
not
even
close
her
eyes
;
and
,
as
soon
as
the
new
day
broke
,
she
rose
to
breathe
the
early
morning
air
at
her
window
,
and
to
think
in
perfect
tranquillity
over
all
that
had
passed
since
she
entered
the
Melani
Palace
to
wait
on
the
guests
at
the
masquerade
.
  
<EOS>
On
reaching
home
the
previous
night
,
all
her
other
sensations
had
been
absorbed
in
a
vague
feeling
of
mingled
dread
and
curiosity
,
produced
by
the
sight
of
the
weird
figure
in
the
yellow
mask
,
which
she
had
left
standing
alone
with
Fabio
in
the
palace
corridor
.
<EOS>
The
morning
light
,
however
,
suggested
new
thoughts
.
<EOS>
She
now
opened
the
note
which
the
young
nobleman
had
pressed
into
her
hand
,
and
read
over
and
over
again
the
hurried
pencil
lines
scrawled
on
the
paper
.
<EOS>
Could
there
be
any
harm
,
any
forgetfulness
of
her
own
duty
,
in
using
the
key
inclosed
in
the
note
,
and
keeping
her
appointment
in
the
Ascoli
gardens
at
ten
o'clock
?
<EOS>
Surely
not
 
surely
the
last
sentence
he
had
written
,
"
Believe
in
my
truth
and
honor
,
Nanina
,
for
I
believe
implicitly
in
yours
,
"
was
enough
to
satisfy
her
this
time
that
she
could
not
be
doing
wrong
in
listening
for
once
to
the
pleading
of
her
own
heart
.
<EOS>
And
besides
,
there
in
her
lap
lay
the
key
of
the
wicket
-
gate
.
<EOS>
It
was
absolutely
necessary
to
use
that
,
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
giving
it
back
safely
into
the
hand
of
its
owner
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
last
thought
was
passing
through
her
mind
,
and
plausibly
overcoming
any
faint
doubts
and
difficulties
which
she
might
still
have
left
,
she
was
startled
by
a
sudden
knocking
at
the
street
door
;
and
,
looking
out
of
the
window
immediately
,
saw
a
man
in
livery
standing
in
the
street
,
anxiously
peering
up
at
the
house
to
see
if
his
knocking
had
aroused
anybody
.
  
<EOS>
"
Does
Marta
Angrisani
,
the
sick
-
nurse
,
live
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
man
,
as
soon
as
Nanina
showed
herself
at
the
window
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Must
I
call
her
up
?
<EOS>
Is
there
some
person
ill
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Call
her
up
directly
,
"
said
the
servant
;
"
she
is
wanted
at
the
Ascoli
Palace
.
<EOS>
My
master
,
Count
Fabio
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
waited
to
hear
no
more
.
<EOS>
She
flew
to
the
room
in
which
the
sick
-
nurse
slept
,
and
awoke
her
,
almost
roughly
,
in
an
instant
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
ill
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
make
haste
,
make
haste
!
<EOS>
He
is
ill
,
and
he
has
sent
for
you
!
"
  
<EOS>
Marta
inquired
who
had
sent
for
her
,
and
on
being
informed
,
promised
to
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
Nanina
ran
downstairs
to
tell
the
servant
that
the
sick
-
nurse
was
getting
on
her
clothes
.
<EOS>
The
man
's
serious
expression
,
when
she
came
close
to
him
,
terrified
her
.
<EOS>
All
her
usual
self
-
distrust
vanished
;
and
she
entreated
him
,
without
attempting
to
conceal
her
anxiety
,
to
tell
her
particularly
what
his
master
's
illness
was
,
and
how
it
had
affected
him
so
suddenly
after
the
ball
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
"
answered
the
man
,
noticing
Nanina
's
manner
as
she
put
her
question
,
with
some
surprise
,
"
except
that
my
master
was
brought
home
by
two
gentlemen
,
friends
of
his
,
about
a
couple
of
hours
ago
,
in
a
very
sad
state
;
half
out
of
his
mind
,
as
it
seemed
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
gathered
from
what
was
said
that
he
had
got
a
dreadful
shock
from
seeing
some
woman
take
off
her
mask
,
and
show
her
face
to
him
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
How
that
could
be
I
do
n't
in
the
least
understand
;
but
I
know
that
when
the
doctor
was
sent
for
,
he
looked
very
serious
,
and
talked
about
fearing
brain
-
fever
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
the
servant
stopped
;
for
,
to
his
astonishment
,
he
saw
Nanina
suddenly
turn
away
from
him
,
and
then
heard
her
crying
bitterly
as
she
went
back
into
the
house
.
  
<EOS>
Marta
Angrisani
had
huddled
on
her
clothes
and
was
looking
at
herself
in
the
glass
to
see
that
she
was
sufficiently
presentable
to
appear
at
the
palace
,
when
she
felt
two
arms
flung
round
her
neck
;
and
,
before
she
could
say
a
word
,
found
Nanina
sobbing
on
her
bosom
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
ill
 
<EOS>
he
is
in
danger
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
girl
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
go
with
you
to
help
him
.
<EOS>
You
have
always
been
kind
to
me
,
Marta
 
be
kinder
than
ever
now
.
<EOS>
Take
me
with
you
 
take
me
with
you
to
the
palace
!
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
,
child
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
nurse
,
gently
unclasping
her
arms
.
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
 
yes
!
<EOS>
if
it
is
only
for
an
hour
,
"
pleaded
Nanina
;
"
if
it
is
only
for
one
little
hour
every
day
.
<EOS>
You
have
only
to
say
that
I
am
your
helper
,
and
they
would
let
me
in
.
<EOS>
Marta
!
<EOS>
I
shall
break
my
heart
if
I
ca
n't
see
him
,
and
help
him
to
get
well
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
nurse
still
hesitated
.
<EOS>
Nanina
clasped
her
round
the
neck
once
more
,
and
laid
her
cheek
 
burning
hot
now
,
though
the
tears
had
been
streaming
down
it
but
an
instant
before
 
close
to
the
good
woman
's
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
love
him
,
Marta
;
great
as
he
is
,
I
love
him
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
strength
,
"
she
went
on
,
in
quick
,
eager
,
whispering
tones
;
"
and
he
loves
me
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
married
me
if
I
had
not
gone
away
to
save
him
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
could
keep
my
love
for
him
a
secret
while
he
was
well
;
I
could
stifle
it
,
and
crush
it
down
,
and
wither
it
up
by
absence
.
<EOS>
But
now
he
is
ill
,
it
gets
beyond
me
;
I
ca
n't
master
it
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
Marta
!
<EOS>
do
n't
break
my
heart
by
denying
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
suffered
so
much
for
his
sake
,
that
I
have
earned
the
right
to
nurse
him
!
"
  
<EOS>
Marta
was
not
proof
against
this
last
appeal
.
<EOS>
She
had
one
great
and
rare
merit
for
a
middle
-
aged
woman
 
<EOS>
she
had
not
forgotten
her
own
youth
.
  
<EOS>
"
Come
,
child
,
"
said
she
,
soothingly
;
"
I
wo
n't
attempt
to
deny
you
.
<EOS>
Dry
your
eyes
,
put
on
your
mantilla
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
we
get
face
to
face
with
the
doctor
,
try
to
look
as
old
and
ugly
as
you
can
,
if
you
want
to
be
let
into
the
sick
-
room
along
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
ordeal
of
medical
scrutiny
was
passed
more
easily
than
Marta
Angrisani
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
great
importance
,
in
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
that
the
sick
man
should
see
familiar
faces
at
his
bedside
.
<EOS>
Nanina
had
only
,
therefore
,
to
state
that
he
knew
her
well
,
and
that
she
had
sat
to
him
as
a
model
in
the
days
when
he
was
learning
the
art
of
sculpture
,
to
be
immediately
accepted
as
Marta
's
privileged
assistant
in
the
sick
-
room
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
apprehensions
felt
by
the
doctor
for
the
patient
were
soon
realized
.
<EOS>
The
fever
flew
to
his
brain
.
<EOS>
For
nearly
six
weeks
he
lay
prostrate
,
at
the
mercy
of
death
;
now
raging
with
the
wild
strength
of
delirium
,
and
now
sunk
in
the
speechless
,
motionless
,
sleepless
exhaustion
which
was
his
only
repose
.
<EOS>
At
last
;
the
blessed
day
came
when
he
enjoyed
his
first
sleep
,
and
when
the
doctor
began
,
for
the
first
time
,
to
talk
of
the
future
with
hope
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
however
,
the
same
terrible
peculiarity
marked
his
light
dreams
which
had
previously
shown
itself
in
his
fierce
delirium
.
<EOS>
From
the
faintly
uttered
,
broken
phrases
which
dropped
from
him
when
he
slept
,
as
from
the
wild
words
which
burst
from
him
when
his
senses
were
deranged
,
the
one
sad
discovery
inevitably
resulted
 
that
his
mind
was
still
haunted
,
day
and
night
,
hour
after
hour
,
by
the
figure
in
the
yellow
mask
.
  
<EOS>
As
his
bodily
health
improved
,
the
doctor
in
attendance
on
him
grew
more
and
more
anxious
as
to
the
state
of
his
mind
.
<EOS>
There
was
no
appearance
of
any
positive
derangement
of
intellect
,
but
there
was
a
mental
depression
 
an
unaltering
,
invincible
prostration
,
produced
by
his
absolute
belief
in
the
reality
of
the
dreadful
vision
that
he
had
seen
at
the
masked
ball
 
which
suggested
to
the
physician
the
gravest
doubts
about
the
case
.
<EOS>
He
saw
with
dismay
that
the
patient
showed
no
anxiety
,
as
he
got
stronger
,
except
on
one
subject

<EOS>
He
was
eagerly
desirous
of
seeing
Nanina
every
day
by
his
bedside
;
but
,
as
soon
as
he
was
assured
that
his
wish
should
be
faithfully
complied
with
,
he
seemed
to
care
for
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
Even
when
they
proposed
,
in
the
hope
of
rousing
him
to
an
exhibition
of
something
like
pleasure
,
that
the
girl
should
read
to
him
for
an
hour
every
day
out
of
one
of
his
favorite
books
,
he
only
showed
a
languid
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Weeks
passed
away
,
and
still
,
do
what
they
would
,
they
could
not
make
him
so
much
as
smile
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
Nanina
had
begun
to
read
to
him
as
usual
,
but
had
not
proceeded
far
before
Marta
Angrisani
informed
her
that
he
had
fallen
into
a
doze
.
<EOS>
She
ceased
with
a
sigh
,
and
sat
looking
at
him
sadly
,
as
he
lay
near
her
,
faint
and
pale
and
mournful
in
his
sleep
 
miserably
altered
from
what
he
was
when
she
first
knew
him
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
a
hard
trial
to
watch
by
his
bedside
in
the
terrible
time
of
his
delirium
;
but
it
was
a
harder
trial
still
to
look
at
him
now
,
and
to
feel
less
and
less
hopeful
with
each
succeeding
day
.
  
<EOS>
While
her
eyes
and
thoughts
were
still
compassionately
fixed
on
him
,
the
door
of
the
bedroom
opened
,
and
the
doctor
came
in
,
followed
by
Andrea
D'Arbino
,
whose
share
in
the
strange
adventure
with
the
Yellow
Mask
caused
him
to
feel
a
special
interest
in
Fabio
's
progress
toward
recovery
.
  
<EOS>
"
Asleep
,
I
see
;
and
sighing
in
his
sleep
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
going
to
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
grand
difficulty
with
him
,
"
he
continued
,
turning
to
D'Arbino
,
"
remains
precisely
what
it
was
.
<EOS>
I
have
hardly
left
a
single
means
untried
of
rousing
him
from
that
fatal
depression
;
yet
,
for
the
last
fortnight
,
he
has
not
advanced
a
single
step
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
shake
his
conviction
of
the
reality
of
that
face
which
he
saw
(
or
rather
which
he
thinks
he
saw
)
when
the
yellow
mask
was
removed
;
and
,
as
long
as
he
persists
in
his
own
shocking
view
of
the
case
,
so
long
he
will
lie
there
,
getting
better
,
<EOS>
no
doubt
,
as
to
his
body
,
but
worse
as
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
poor
fellow
,
he
is
not
in
a
fit
state
to
be
reasoned
with
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
On
the
contrary
,
like
all
men
with
a
fixed
delusion
,
he
has
plenty
of
intelligence
to
appeal
to
on
every
point
,
except
the
one
point
on
which
he
is
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
have
argued
with
him
vainly
by
the
hour
together
.
<EOS>
He
possesses
,
unfortunately
,
an
acute
nervous
sensibility
and
a
vivid
imagination
;
and
besides
,
he
has
,
as
I
suspect
,
been
superstitiously
brought
up
as
a
child
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
probably
useless
to
argue
rationally
with
him
on
certain
spiritual
subjects
,
even
if
his
mind
was
in
perfect
health
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
good
deal
of
the
mystic
and
the
dreamer
in
his
composition
;
and
science
and
logic
are
but
broken
reeds
to
depend
upon
with
men
of
that
kind
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Does
he
merely
listen
to
you
when
you
reason
with
him
,
or
does
he
attempt
to
answer
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
He
has
only
one
form
of
answer
,
and
that
is
,
unfortunately
,
the
most
difficult
of
all
to
dispose
of
.
<EOS>
Whenever
I
try
to
convince
him
of
his
delusion
,
he
invariably
retorts
by
asking
me
for
a
rational
explanation
of
what
happened
to
him
at
the
masked
ball
.
<EOS>
Now
,
neither
you
nor
I
,
though
we
believe
firmly
that
he
has
been
the
dupe
of
some
infamous
conspiracy
,
have
been
able
as
yet
to
penetrate
thoroughly
into
this
mystery
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
Our
common
sense
tells
us
that
he
must
be
wrong
in
taking
his
view
of
it
,
and
that
we
must
be
right
in
taking
ours
;
but
if
we
can
not
give
him
actual
,
tangible
proof
of
that
 
if
we
can
only
theorize
,
when
he
asks
us
for
an
explanation
 
<EOS>
it
is
but
too
plain
,
in
his
present
condition
,
that
every
time
we
remonstrate
with
him
on
the
subject
we
only
fix
him
in
his
delusion
more
and
more
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
for
want
of
perseverance
on
my
part
,
"
said
D'Arbino
,
after
a
moment
of
silence
,
"
that
we
are
still
left
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
the
extraordinary
statement
of
the
coachman
who
drove
the
woman
home
,
I
have
been
inquiring
and
investigating
.
<EOS>
I
have
offered
the
reward
of
two
hundred
scudi
for
the
discovery
of
her
;
I
have
myself
examined
the
servants
at
the
palace
,
the
night
-
watchman
at
the
Campo
Santo
,
the
police
-
books
,
the
lists
of
keepers
of
hotels
and
lodging
-
houses
,
to
hit
on
some
trace
of
this
woman
;
and
I
have
failed
in
all
directions
.
<EOS>
If
my
poor
friend
's
perfect
recovery
does
indeed
depend
on
his
delusion
being
combated
by
actual
proof
,
I
fear
we
have
but
little
chance
of
restoring
him
.
<EOS>
So
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
confess
myself
at
the
end
of
my
resources
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
hope
we
are
not
quite
conquered
yet
,
"
returned
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
The
proofs
we
want
may
turn
up
when
we
least
expect
them
.
<EOS>
It
is
certainly
a
miserable
case
,
"
he
continued
,
mechanically
laying
his
fingers
on
the
sleeping
man
's
pulse
.
<EOS>
"
There
he
lies
,
wanting
nothing
now
but
to
recover
the
natural
elasticity
of
his
mind
;
and
here
we
stand
at
his
bedside
,
unable
to
relieve
him
of
the
weight
that
is
pressing
his
faculties
down
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
it
,
Signor
Andrea
,
nothing
will
rouse
him
from
his
delusion
that
he
is
the
victim
of
a
supernatural
interposition
but
the
production
of
some
startling
,
practical
proof
of
his
error
.
<EOS>
At
present
he
is
in
the
position
of
a
man
who
has
been
imprisoned
from
his
birth
in
a
dark
room
,
and
who
denies
the
existence
of
daylight
.
<EOS>
If
we
can
not
open
the
shutters
and
show
him
the
sky
outside
,
we
shall
never
convert
him
to
a
knowledge
of
the
truth
.
"
  
<EOS>
Saying
these
words
,
the
doctor
turned
to
lead
the
way
out
of
the
room
,
and
observed
Nanina
,
who
had
moved
from
the
bedside
on
his
entrance
,
standing
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
stopped
to
look
at
her
,
shook
his
head
good
-
humoredly
,
and
called
to
Marta
,
who
happened
to
be
occupied
in
an
adjoining
room
.
  
<EOS>
"
Signora
Marta
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
"
I
think
you
told
me
some
time
ago
that
your
pretty
and
careful
little
assistant
lives
in
your
house
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
does
she
take
much
walking
exercise
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Very
little
,
Signor
Dottore
.
<EOS>
She
goes
home
to
her
sister
when
she
leaves
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Very
little
walking
exercise
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
thought
so
!
<EOS>
Her
pale
cheeks
and
heavy
eyes
told
me
as
much
.
<EOS>
Now
,
my
dear
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
addressing
Nanina
,
"
you
are
a
very
good
girl
,
and
I
am
sure
you
will
attend
to
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Go
out
every
morning
before
you
come
here
,
and
take
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
.
<EOS>
You
are
too
young
not
to
suffer
by
being
shut
up
in
close
rooms
every
day
,
unless
you
get
some
regular
exercise
.
<EOS>
Take
a
good
long
walk
in
the
morning
,
or
you
will
fall
into
my
hands
as
a
patient
,
and
be
quite
unfit
to
continue
your
attendance
here
.
<EOS>
Now
,
Signor
Andrea
,
I
am
ready
for
you
.
<EOS>
Mind
,
my
child
,
a
walk
every
day
in
the
open
air
outside
the
town
,
or
you
will
fall
ill
,
take
my
word
for
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
promised
compliance
;
but
she
spoke
rather
absently
,
and
seemed
scarcely
conscious
of
the
kind
familiarity
which
marked
the
doctor
's
manner
.
<EOS>
The
truth
was
,
that
all
her
thoughts
were
occupied
with
what
he
had
been
saying
by
Fabio
's
bedside
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
lost
one
word
of
the
conversation
while
the
doctor
was
talking
of
his
patient
,
and
of
the
conditions
on
which
his
recovery
depended
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
if
that
proof
which
would
cure
him
could
only
be
found
!
<EOS>
"
she
thought
to
herself
,
as
she
stole
back
anxiously
to
the
bedside
when
the
room
was
empty
.
  
<EOS>
On
getting
home
that
day
she
found
a
letter
waiting
for
her
,
and
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
written
by
no
less
a
person
than
the
master
-
sculptor
,
Luca
Lomi
.
<EOS>
It
was
very
short
;
simply
informing
her
that
he
had
just
returned
to
Pisa
,
and
that
he
was
anxious
to
know
when
she
could
sit
to
him
for
a
new
bust
 
<EOS>
a
commission
from
a
rich
foreigner
at
Naples
.
  
<EOS>
Nanina
debated
with
herself
for
a
moment
whether
she
should
answer
the
letter
in
the
hardest
way
,
to
her
,
by
writing
,
or
,
in
the
easiest
way
,
in
person
;
and
decided
on
going
to
the
studio
and
telling
the
master
-
sculptor
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
serve
him
as
a
model
,
at
least
for
some
time
to
come
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
taken
her
a
long
hour
to
say
this
with
due
propriety
on
paper
;
it
would
only
take
her
a
few
minutes
to
say
it
with
her
own
lips
.
<EOS>
So
she
put
on
her
mantilla
again
and
departed
for
the
studio
.
  
<EOS>
On
,
arriving
at
the
gate
and
ringing
the
bell
,
a
thought
suddenly
occurred
to
her
,
which
she
wondered
had
not
struck
her
before
.
<EOS>
Was
it
not
possible
that
she
might
meet
Father
Rocco
in
his
brother
's
work
-
room
?
<EOS>
It
was
too
late
to
retreat
now
,
but
not
too
late
to
ask
,
before
she
entered
,
if
the
priest
was
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
when
one
of
the
workmen
opened
the
door
to
her
,
she
inquired
first
,
very
confusedly
and
anxiously
,
for
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
Hearing
that
he
was
not
with
his
brother
then
,
she
went
tranquilly
enough
to
make
her
apologies
to
the
master
-
sculptor
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
tell
him
more
than
that
she
was
now
occupied
every
day
by
nursing
duties
in
a
sick
-
room
,
and
that
it
was
consequently
out
of
her
power
to
attend
at
the
studio
.
<EOS>
Luca
Lomi
expressed
,
and
evidently
felt
,
great
disappointment
at
her
failing
him
as
a
model
,
and
tried
hard
to
persuade
her
that
she
might
find
time
enough
,
if
she
chose
,
to
sit
to
him
,
as
well
as
to
nurse
the
sick
person
.
<EOS>
The
more
she
resisted
his
arguments
and
entreaties
,
the
more
obstinately
he
reiterated
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
dusting
his
favorite
busts
and
statues
,
after
his
long
absence
,
with
a
feather
-
brush
when
she
came
in
;
and
he
continued
this
occupation
all
the
while
he
was
talking
 
urging
a
fresh
plea
to
induce
Nanina
to
reconsider
her
refusal
to
sit
at
every
fresh
piece
of
sculpture
he
came
to
,
and
always
receiving
the
same
resolute
apology
from
her
as
she
slowly
followed
him
down
the
studio
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
Arriving
thus
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
,
Luca
stopped
with
a
fresh
argument
on
his
lips
before
his
statue
of
Minerva
.
<EOS>
He
had
dusted
it
already
,
but
he
lovingly
returned
to
dust
it
again
.
<EOS>
It
was
his
favorite
work
 
the
only
good
likeness
(
although
it
did
assume
to
represent
a
classical
subject
)
of
his
dead
daughter
that
he
possessed
.
<EOS>
He
had
refused
to
part
with
it
for
Maddalena
's
sake
;
and
,
as
he
now
approached
it
with
his
brush
for
the
second
time
,
he
absently
ceased
speaking
,
and
mounted
on
a
stool
to
look
at
the
face
near
and
blow
some
specks
of
dust
off
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
Nanina
thought
this
a
good
opportunity
of
escaping
from
further
importunities
.
<EOS>
She
was
on
the
point
of
slipping
away
to
the
door
with
a
word
of
farewell
,
when
a
sudden
exclamation
from
Luca
Lomi
arrested
her
.
  
<EOS>
"
Plaster
!
"
cried
the
master
-
sculptor
,
looking
intently
at
that
part
of
the
hair
of
the
statue
which
lay
lowest
on
the
forehead
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Plaster
here
!
"
<EOS>
He
took
out
his
penknife
as
he
spoke
,
and
removed
a
tiny
morsel
of
some
white
substance
from
an
interstice
between
two
folds
of
the
hair
where
it
touched
the
face
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
plaster
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
excitedly
.
"
<EOS>
Somebody
has
been
taking
a
cast
from
the
face
of
my
statue
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
jumped
off
the
stool
,
and
looked
all
round
the
studio
with
an
expression
of
suspicious
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
this
cleared
up
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
My
statues
were
left
under
Rocco
's
care
,
and
he
is
answerable
if
there
has
been
any
stealing
of
casts
from
any
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
I
must
question
him
directly
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
,
seeing
that
he
took
no
notice
of
her
,
felt
that
she
might
now
easily
effect
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
She
opened
the
studio
door
,
and
repeated
,
for
the
twentieth
time
at
least
,
that
she
was
sorry
she
could
not
sit
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
too
,
child
,
"
he
said
,
irritably
looking
about
for
his
hat
.
<EOS>
He
found
it
apparently
just
as
Nanina
was
going
out
;
for
she
heard
him
call
to
one
of
the
workmen
in
the
inner
studio
,
and
order
the
man
to
say
,
if
anybody
wanted
him
,
that
he
had
gone
to
Father
Rocco
's
lodgings
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
when
Nanina
rose
,
a
bad
attack
of
headache
,
and
a
sense
of
languor
and
depression
,
reminded
her
of
the
necessity
of
following
the
doctor
's
advice
,
and
preserving
her
health
by
getting
a
little
fresh
air
and
exercise
.
<EOS>
She
had
more
than
two
hours
to
spare
before
the
usual
time
when
her
daily
attendance
began
at
the
Ascoli
Palace
;
and
she
determined
to
employ
the
interval
of
leisure
in
taking
a
morning
walk
outside
the
town
.
<EOS>
La
Biondella
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
go
too
,
but
she
had
a
large
order
for
dinner
-
mats
on
hand
,
and
was
obliged
,
for
that
day
,
to
stop
in
the
house
and
work
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
that
when
Nanina
set
forth
from
home
,
the
learned
poodle
,
Scarammuccia
,
was
her
only
companion
.
  
<EOS>
She
took
the
nearest
way
out
of
the
town
;
the
dog
trotting
along
in
his
usual
steady
,
observant
way
close
at
her
side
,
pushing
his
great
rough
muzzle
,
from
time
to
time
,
affectionately
into
her
hand
,
and
trying
hard
to
attract
her
attention
at
intervals
by
barking
and
capering
in
front
of
her
.
<EOS>
He
got
but
<EOS>
little
notice
,
however
,
for
his
pains
.
<EOS>
Nanina
was
thinking
again
of
all
that
the
physician
had
said
the
day
before
by
Fabio
's
bedside
,
and
these
thoughts
brought
with
them
others
,
equally
absorbing
,
that
were
connected
with
the
mysterious
story
of
the
young
nobleman
's
adventure
with
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
Thus
preoccupied
,
she
had
little
attention
left
for
the
gambols
of
the
dog
.
<EOS>
Even
the
beauty
of
the
morning
appealed
to
her
in
vain
.
<EOS>
She
felt
the
refreshment
of
the
cool
,
fragrant
air
,
but
she
hardly
noticed
the
lovely
blue
of
the
sky
,
or
the
bright
sunshine
that
gave
a
gayety
and
an
interest
to
the
commonest
objects
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
After
walking
nearly
an
hour
,
she
began
to
feel
tired
,
and
looked
about
for
a
shady
place
to
rest
in
.
  
<EOS>
Beyond
and
behind
her
there
was
only
the
high
-
road
and
the
flat
country
;
but
by
her
side
stood
a
little
wooden
building
,
half
inn
,
half
coffee
-
house
,
backed
by
a
large
,
shady
pleasure
.
<EOS>
garden
,
the
gates
of
which
stood
invitingly
open
.
<EOS>
Some
workmen
in
the
garden
were
putting
up
a
stage
for
fireworks
,
but
the
place
was
otherwise
quiet
and
lonely
enough
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
used
at
night
as
a
sort
of
rustic
Ranelagh
,
to
which
the
citizens
of
Pisa
resorted
for
pure
air
and
amusement
after
the
fatigues
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Observing
that
there
were
no
visitors
in
the
grounds
,
Nanina
ventured
in
,
intending
to
take
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
rest
in
the
coolest
place
she
could
find
before
returning
to
Pisa
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
passed
the
back
of
a
wooden
summer
-
house
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
gardens
,
when
she
suddenly
missed
the
dog
from
her
side
;
and
,
looking
round
after
him
,
saw
that
he
was
standing
behind
the
summer
-
house
with
his
ears
erect
and
his
nose
to
the
ground
,
having
evidently
that
instant
scented
something
that
excited
his
suspicion
.
  
<EOS>
Thinking
it
possible
that
he
might
be
meditating
an
attack
on
some
unfortunate
cat
,
she
turned
to
see
what
he
was
watching
.
<EOS>
The
carpenters
engaged
on
the
firework
stage
were
just
then
hammering
at
it
violently
.
<EOS>
The
noise
prevented
her
from
hearing
that
Scarammuccia
was
growling
,
but
she
could
feel
that
he
was
the
moment
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
Her
curiosity
was
excited
,
and
she
stooped
down
close
to
him
to
look
through
a
crack
in
the
boards
before
which
he
stood
into
the
summer
-
house
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
startled
at
seeing
a
lady
and
gentleman
sitting
inside
.
<EOS>
The
place
she
was
looking
through
was
not
high
enough
up
to
enable
her
to
see
their
faces
,
but
she
recognized
,
or
thought
she
recognized
,
the
pattern
of
the
lady
's
dress
as
one
which
she
had
noticed
in
former
days
in
the
Demoiselle
Grifoni
's
show
-
room
.
<EOS>
Rising
quickly
,
her
eye
detected
a
hole
in
the
boards
about
the
level
of
her
own
height
,
caused
by
a
knot
having
been
forced
out
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
She
looked
through
it
to
ascertain
,
without
being
discovered
,
if
the
wearer
of
the
familiar
dress
was
the
person
she
had
taken
her
to
be
;
and
saw
,
not
Brigida
only
,
as
she
had
expected
,
but
<EOS>
Father
Rocco
as
well
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
the
carpenters
left
off
hammering
and
began
to
saw
.
<EOS>
The
new
sound
from
the
firework
stage
was
regular
and
not
loud
.
<EOS>
The
voices
of
the
occupants
of
the
summer
-
house
reached
her
through
it
,
and
she
heard
Brigida
pronounce
the
name
of
Count
Fabio
.
  
<EOS>
Instantly
stooping
down
once
more
by
the
dog
's
side
,
she
caught
his
muzzle
firmly
in
both
her
hands
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
only
way
to
keep
Scarammuccia
from
growling
again
,
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
din
of
hammering
to
prevent
him
from
being
heard
.
<EOS>
Those
two
words
,
"
Count
Fabio
,
"
in
the
mouth
of
another
woman
,
excited
a
jealous
anxiety
in
her
.
<EOS>
What
could
Brigida
have
to
say
in
connection
with
that
name
?
<EOS>
She
never
came
near
the
Ascoli
Palace
 
<EOS>
what
right
or
reason
<EOS>
could
she
have
to
talk
of
Fabio
?
  
<EOS>
"
Did
you
hear
what
I
said
?
<EOS>
"
she
heard
Brigida
ask
,
in
her
coolest
,
hardest
tone
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
"
the
priest
answered
.
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
not
all
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
repeat
it
,
then
.
<EOS>
I
asked
what
had
so
suddenly
determined
you
to
give
up
all
idea
of
making
any
future
experiments
on
the
superstitious
fears
of
Count
Fabio
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
,
the
result
of
the
experiment
already
tried
has
been
so
much
more
serious
than
I
had
anticipated
,
that
I
believe
the
end
I
had
in
view
in
making
it
has
been
answered
already
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Well
;
that
is
not
your
only
reason
?
"
  
"
Another
shock
to
his
mind
might
be
fatal
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
can
use
what
I
believe
to
be
a
justifiable
fraud
to
prevent
his
marrying
again
;
but
I
can
not
burden
myself
with
a
crime
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
That
is
your
second
reason
;
but
I
believe
you
have
another
yet
.
<EOS>
The
suddenness
with
which
you
sent
to
me
last
night
to
appoint
a
meeting
in
this
lonely
place
;
the
emphatic
manner
in
which
you
requested
 
I
may
almost
say
ordered
 
me
to
bring
the
wax
mask
here
,
suggest
to
my
mind
that
something
must
have
happened
.
<EOS>
What
is
it
?
<EOS>
I
am
a
woman
,
and
my
curiosity
must
be
satisfied
.
<EOS>
After
the
secrets
you
have
trusted
to
me
already
,
you
need
not
hesitate
,
I
think
,
to
trust
me
with
one
more
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
not
.
<EOS>
The
secret
this
time
is
,
moreover
,
of
no
great
importance
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
the
wax
mask
you
wore
at
the
ball
was
made
in
a
plaster
mold
taken
off
the
face
of
my
brother
's
statue
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
I
know
that
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
brother
has
just
returned
to
his
studio
;
has
found
a
morsel
of
the
plaster
I
used
for
the
mold
sticking
in
the
hair
of
the
statue
;
and
has
asked
me
,
as
the
person
left
in
charge
of
his
work
-
rooms
,
for
an
explanation
.
<EOS>
Such
an
explanation
as
I
could
offer
has
not
satisfied
him
,
and
he
talks
of
making
further
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Considering
that
it
will
be
used
no
more
,
I
think
it
safest
to
destroy
the
wax
mask
,
and
I
asked
you
to
bring
it
here
,
that
I
might
see
it
burned
or
broken
up
with
my
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
Now
you
know
all
you
wanted
to
know
;
and
now
,
therefore
,
it
is
my
turn
to
remind
you
that
I
have
not
yet
had
a
direct
answer
to
the
first
question
I
addressed
to
you
when
we
met
here
.
<EOS>
Have
you
brought
the
wax
mask
with
you
,
or
have
you
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
And
why
?
"
  
<EOS>
Just
as
that
question
was
put
,
Nanina
felt
the
dog
dragging
himself
free
of
her
grasp
on
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
listening
hitherto
with
such
painful
intensity
,
with
such
all
-
absorbing
emotions
of
suspense
,
terror
,
and
astonishment
,
that
she
had
not
noticed
his
efforts
to
get
away
,
and
had
continued
mechanically
to
hold
his
mouth
shut
.
<EOS>
But
now
she
was
aroused
by
the
violence
of
his
struggles
to
the
knowledge
that
,
unless
she
hit
upon
some
new
means
of
quieting
him
,
he
would
have
his
mouth
free
,
and
would
betray
her
by
a
growl
.
  
<EOS>
In
an
agony
of
apprehension
lest
she
should
lose
a
word
of
the
momentous
conversation
,
she
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
appeal
to
the
dog
's
fondness
for
her
,
by
suddenly
flinging
both
her
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
kissing
his
rough
,
hairy
cheek
.
<EOS>
The
stratagem
succeeded
.
<EOS>
Scarammuccia
had
,
for
many
years
past
,
never
received
any
greater
marks
of
his
mistress
's
kindness
for
him
than
such
as
a
pat
on
the
head
or
a
present
of
a
lump
of
sugar
might
convey
.
<EOS>
His
dog
's
nature
was
utterly
confounded
by
the
unexpected
warmth
of
Nanina
's
caress
,
and
he
struggled
up
vigorously
in
her
arms
to
try
and
return
it
by
licking
her
face
.
<EOS>
She
could
easily
prevent
him
from
doing
this
,
and
could
so
gain
a
few
minutes
more
to
listen
behind
the
summer
-
house
without
danger
of
discovery
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
lost
Brigida
's
answer
to
Father
Rocco
's
question
;
but
she
was
in
time
to
hear
her
next
words
.
  
<EOS>
"
We
are
alone
here
,
"
said
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
woman
,
and
I
do
n't
know
that
you
may
not
have
come
armed
.
<EOS>
It
is
only
the
commonest
precaution
on
my
part
not
to
give
you
a
chance
of
getting
at
the
wax
mask
till
I
have
made
my
conditions
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
You
never
said
a
word
about
conditions
before
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
True
.
<EOS>
I
remember
telling
you
that
I
wanted
nothing
but
the
novelty
of
going
to
the
masquerade
in
the
character
of
my
dead
enemy
,
and
the
luxury
of
being
able
to
terrify
the
man
who
had
brutally
ridiculed
me
in
old
days
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
That
was
the
truth
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
the
less
the
truth
that
our
experiment
on
Count
Fabio
has
detained
me
in
this
city
much
longer
than
I
ever
intended
,
that
I
am
all
but
penniless
,
and
that
I
deserve
to
be
paid
.
<EOS>
In
plain
words
,
will
you
buy
the
mask
of
me
for
two
hundred
scudi
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
twenty
scudi
in
the
world
,
at
my
own
free
disposal
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
You
must
find
two
hundred
if
you
want
the
wax
mask
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
wish
to
threaten
 
but
money
I
must
have
.
<EOS>
I
mention
the
sum
of
two
hundred
scudi
,
because
that
is
the
exact
amount
offered
in
the
public
handbills
by
Count
Fabio
's
friends
for
the
discovery
of
the
woman
who
wore
the
yellow
mask
at
the
Marquis
Melani
's
ball
.
<EOS>
What
have
I
to
do
but
to
earn
that
money
if
I
please
,
by
going
to
the
palace
,
taking
the
wax
mask
with
me
,
and
telling
them
that
I
am
the
woman
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
confess
in
that
way
;
they
can
do
nothing
to
hurt
me
,
and
I
should
be
two
hundred
scudi
the
richer
.
<EOS>
You
might
be
injured
,
to
be
sure
,
if
they
insisted
on
knowing
who
made
the
wax
model
,
and
who
suggested
the
ghastly
disguise
"
  
"
Wretch
!
<EOS>
do
you
believe
that
my
character
could
be
injured
on
the
unsupported
evidence
of
any
words
from
your
lips
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Father
Rocco
,
for
the
first
time
since
I
have
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
your
acquaintance
,
I
find
you
committing
a
breach
of
good
manners
.
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
you
until
you
become
more
like
yourself
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
to
apologize
for
calling
me
a
wretch
,
and
if
you
want
to
secure
the
wax
mask
,
honor
me
with
a
visit
before
four
o'clock
this
afternoon
,
and
bring
two
hundred
scudi
with
you
.
<EOS>
Delay
till
after
four
,
and
it
will
be
too
late
.
"
  
<EOS>
An
instant
of
silence
followed
;
and
then
Nanina
judged
that
Brigida
must
be
departing
,
for
she
heard
the
rustling
of
a
dress
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
Scarammuccia
heard
it
too
.
<EOS>
He
twisted
himself
round
in
her
arms
and
growled
.
  
<EOS>
The
noise
disturbed
Father
Rocco
.
<EOS>
She
heard
him
rise
and
leave
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
There
would
have
been
time
enough
,
perhaps
,
for
her
to
conceal
herself
among
some
trees
if
she
could
have
recovered
her
self
-
possession
at
once
;
but
she
was
incapable
of
making
an
effort
to
regain
it
.
<EOS>
She
could
neither
think
nor
move
 
<EOS>
her
breath
seemed
to
die
away
on
her
lips
 
as
she
saw
the
shadow
of
the
priest
stealing
over
the
grass
slowly
from
the
front
to
the
back
of
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
In
another
moment
they
were
face
to
face
.
  
<EOS>
He
stopped
a
few
paces
from
her
,
and
eyed
her
steadily
in
dead
silence
.
<EOS>
She
still
crouched
against
the
summer
-
house
,
and
still
with
one
hand
mechanically
kept
her
hold
of
the
dog
.
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
the
priest
that
she
did
so
.
<EOS>
Scarammuccia
's
formidable
teeth
were
in
full
view
,
his
shaggy
coat
was
bristling
,
his
eyes
were
starting
,
his
growl
had
changed
from
the
surly
to
the
savage
note
;
he
was
ready
to
tear
down
,
not
Father
Rocco
only
,
but
all
the
clergy
in
Pisa
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
been
listening
,
"
said
the
priest
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
see
it
in
your
face
.
<EOS>
You
have
heard
all
.
"
  
<EOS>
She
could
not
answer
a
word
;
she
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
him
.
<EOS>
There
was
an
unnatural
stillness
in
his
face
,
a
steady
,
unrepentant
,
unfathomable
despair
in
his
eyes
that
struck
her
with
horror
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
worlds
to
be
able
to
rise
to
her
feet
and
fly
from
his
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
once
distrusted
you
and
watched
you
in
secret
,
"
he
said
,
speaking
after
a
short
silence
,
thoughtfully
,
and
with
a
strange
,
tranquil
sadness
in
his
voice
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
what
I
did
by
you
,
you
do
by
me
.
<EOS>
You
put
the
hope
of
your
life
once
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
Is
it
because
they
were
not
worthy
of
the
trust
that
discovery
and
ruin
overtake
me
,
and
that
you
are
the
instrument
of
the
retribution
?
<EOS>
Can
this
be
the
decree
of
Heaven
 
or
is
it
nothing
but
the
blind
justice
of
chance
?
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
upward
,
doubtingly
,
to
the
lustrous
sky
above
him
,
and
sighed
.
<EOS>
Nanina
's
eyes
still
followed
his
mechanically
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
feel
their
influence
,
for
he
suddenly
looked
down
at
her
again
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
keeps
you
silent
?
<EOS>
Why
are
you
afraid
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
do
you
no
harm
,
with
your
dog
at
your
side
,
and
the
workmen
yonder
within
call
.
<EOS>
I
can
do
you
no
harm
,
and
I
wish
to
do
you
none
.
<EOS>
Go
back
to
Pisa
;
tell
what
you
have
heard
,
restore
the
man
you
love
to
himself
,
and
ruin
me
.
<EOS>
That
is
your
work
;
do
it
!
<EOS>
I
was
never
your
enemy
,
even
when
I
distrusted
you
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
your
enemy
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
fault
of
yours
that
a
fatality
has
been
accomplished
through
you
 
no
fault
of
yours
that
I
am
rejected
as
the
instrument
of
securing
a
righteous
restitution
to
the
Church
.
<EOS>
Rise
,
child
,
and
go
your
way
,
while
I
go
mine
,
and
prepare
for
what
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
If
we
never
meet
again
,
remember
that
I
parted
from
you
without
one
hard
saying
or
one
harsh
look
 
parted
from
you
<EOS>
so
,
knowing
that
the
first
words
you
speak
in
Pisa
will
be
death
to
my
character
,
and
destruction
to
the
great
purpose
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Speaking
these
words
,
always
with
the
same
calmness
which
had
marked
his
manner
from
the
first
,
he
looked
fixedly
at
her
for
a
little
while
,
sighed
again
,
and
turned
away
.
<EOS>
Just
before
he
disappeared
among
the
trees
,
he
said
"
Farewell
,
"
<EOS>
but
so
softly
that
she
could
barely
hear
it
.
<EOS>
Some
strange
confusion
clouded
her
mind
as
she
lost
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
Had
she
injured
him
,
or
had
he
injured
her
?
<EOS>
His
words
bewildered
and
oppressed
her
simple
heart
.
<EOS>
Vague
doubts
and
fears
,
and
a
sudden
antipathy
to
remaining
any
longer
near
the
summer
-
house
,
overcame
her
.
<EOS>
She
started
to
her
feet
,
and
,
keeping
the
dog
still
at
her
side
,
hurried
from
the
garden
to
the
highroad
.
<EOS>
There
,
the
wide
glow
of
sunshine
,
the
sight
of
the
city
lying
before
her
,
changed
the
current
of
her
thoughts
,
and
directed
them
all
to
Fabio
and
to
the
future
.
  
<EOS>
A
burning
impatience
to
be
back
in
Pisa
now
possessed
her
.
<EOS>
She
hastened
toward
the
city
at
her
utmost
speed
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
reported
to
be
in
the
palace
when
she
passed
the
servants
lounging
in
the
courtyard
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
moment
,
she
came
into
his
presence
,
that
something
had
happened
,
and
led
her
away
from
the
sick
-
room
into
Fabio
's
empty
study
.
<EOS>
There
she
told
him
all
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
have
saved
him
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
Only
let
that
woman
come
here
for
the
reward
;
and
leave
me
to
deal
with
her
as
she
deserves
.
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
go
away
from
the
palace
on
any
account
until
I
give
you
permission
.
<EOS>
I
am
going
to
send
a
message
immediately
to
Signor
Andrea
D'Arbino
to
come
and
hear
the
extraordinary
disclosure
that
you
have
made
to
me
.
<EOS>
Go
back
to
read
to
the
count
,
as
usual
,
until
I
want
you
again
;
but
,
remember
,
you
must
not
drop
a
word
to
him
yet
of
what
you
have
said
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
must
be
carefully
prepared
for
all
that
we
have
to
tell
him
;
and
must
be
kept
quite
in
the
dark
until
those
preparations
are
made
.
"
  
<EOS>
D'Arbino
answered
the
doctor
's
summons
in
person
;
and
Nanina
repeated
her
story
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
and
the
doctor
remained
closeted
together
for
some
time
after
she
had
concluded
her
narrative
and
had
retired
.
<EOS>
A
little
before
four
o'clock
they
sent
for
her
again
into
the
study
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
sitting
by
the
table
with
a
bag
of
money
before
him
,
and
D'Arbino
was
telling
one
of
the
servants
that
if
a
lady
called
at
the
palace
on
the
subject
of
the
handbill
which
he
had
circulated
,
she
was
to
be
admitted
into
the
study
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
clock
struck
four
Nanina
was
requested
to
take
possession
of
a
window
-
seat
,
and
to
wait
there
until
she
was
summoned
.
<EOS>
When
she
had
obeyed
,
the
doctor
loosened
one
of
the
window
-
curtains
,
to
hide
her
from
the
view
of
any
one
entering
the
room
.
  
<EOS>
About
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
,
and
then
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
Brigida
herself
was
shown
into
the
study
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
bowed
,
and
D'Arbino
placed
a
chair
for
her
.
<EOS>
She
was
perfectly
collected
,
and
thanked
them
for
their
politeness
with
her
best
grace
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
believe
I
am
addressing
confidential
friends
of
Count
Fabio
d'Ascoli
?
<EOS>
"
Brigida
began
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
ask
if
you
are
authorized
to
act
for
the
count
,
in
relation
to
the
reward
which
this
handbill
offers
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
having
examined
the
handbill
,
said
that
the
lady
was
quite
right
,
and
pointed
significantly
to
the
bag
of
money
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
are
prepared
,
then
,
"
pursued
Brigida
,
smiling
,
"
to
give
a
reward
of
two
hundred
scudi
to
any
one
able
to
tell
you
who
the
woman
is
who
wore
the
yellow
mask
at
the
Marquis
Melani
's
ball
,
and
how
she
contrived
to
personate
the
face
and
figure
of
the
late
Countess
d'Ascoli
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Of
course
we
are
prepared
,
"
answered
D'Arbino
,
a
little
irritably
.
"
<EOS>
As
men
of
honor
,
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
promising
anything
that
we
are
not
perfectly
willing
,
under
proper
conditions
,
to
perform
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
Pardon
me
,
my
dear
friend
,
"
said
the
doctor
;
"
I
think
you
speak
a
little
too
warmly
to
the
lady
.
<EOS>
She
is
quite
right
to
take
every
precaution
.
<EOS>
We
have
the
two
hundred
scudi
here
,
madam
,
"
he
continued
,
patting
the
money
-
bag
;
"
and
we
are
prepared
to
pay
that
sum
for
the
information
we
want
.
<EOS>
But
"
(
here
the
doctor
suspiciously
moved
the
bag
of
scudi
from
the
table
to
his
lap
)
<EOS>
"
we
must
have
proofs
that
the
person
claiming
the
reward
is
really
entitled
to
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Brigida
's
eyes
followed
the
money
-
bag
greedily
.
  
<EOS>
"
Proofs
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
taking
a
small
flat
box
from
under
her
cloak
,
and
pushing
it
across
to
the
doctor
.
"
<EOS>
Proofs
!
<EOS>
there
you
will
find
one
proof
that
establishes
my
claim
beyond
the
possibility
of
doubt
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
opened
the
box
,
and
looked
at
the
wax
mask
inside
it
;
then
handed
it
to
D'Arbino
,
and
replaced
the
bag
of
scudi
on
the
table
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
contents
of
that
box
seem
certainly
to
explain
a
great
deal
,
"
he
said
,
pushing
the
bag
gently
toward
Brigida
,
but
always
keeping
his
,
hand
over
it
.
<EOS>
"
The
woman
who
wore
the
yellow
domino
was
,
I
presume
,
of
the
same
height
as
the
late
countess
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Exactly
,
"
said
Brigida
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
also
of
the
same
color
as
the
late
countess
<EOS>
's
<EOS>
;
she
wore
yellow
of
the
same
shade
as
the
hangings
in
the
late
countess
's
room
,
and
she
had
on
,
under
her
yellow
mask
,
the
colorless
wax
model
of
the
late
countess
's
face
,
now
in
your
friend
's
hand
.
<EOS>
So
much
for
that
part
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
Nothing
remains
now
to
be
cleared
up
but
the
mystery
of
who
the
lady
was
.
<EOS>
Have
the
goodness
,
sir
,
to
push
that
bag
an
inch
or
two
nearer
my
way
,
and
I
shall
be
delighted
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Thank
you
,
madam
,
"
said
the
doctor
,
with
a
very
perceptible
change
in
his
manner
.
<EOS>
"
We
know
who
the
lady
was
already
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
moved
the
bag
of
scudi
while
he
spoke
back
to
his
own
side
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Brigida
's
cheeks
reddened
,
and
she
rose
from
her
seat
.
  
<EOS>
"
Am
I
to
understand
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
haughtily
,
"
that
you
take
advantage
of
my
position
here
,
as
a
defenseless
woman
,
to
cheat
me
out
of
the
reward
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
By
no
means
,
madam
,
"
rejoined
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
covenanted
to
pay
the
reward
to
the
person
who
could
give
us
the
information
we
required
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Well
,
sir
!
<EOS>
have
I
not
given
you
part
of
it
?
<EOS>
And
am
I
not
prepared
to
give
you
the
whole
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Certainly
;
but
the
misfortune
is
,
that
another
person
has
been
beforehand
with
you
.
<EOS>
We
ascertained
who
the
lady
in
the
yellow
domino
was
,
and
how
she
contrived
to
personate
the
face
of
the
late
Countess
d'Ascoli
,
several
hours
ago
from
another
informant
.
<EOS>
That
person
has
consequently
the
prior
claim
;
and
,
on
every
principle
of
justice
,
that
person
must
also
have
the
reward
.
<EOS>
Nanina
,
this
bag
belongs
to
you
 
come
and
take
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
Nanina
appeared
from
the
window
-
seat
.
<EOS>
Brigida
,
thunderstruck
,
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
;
gasped
out
,
"
That
girl
!
"
 
<EOS>
then
stopped
again
,
breathless
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
girl
was
at
the
back
of
the
summer
-
house
this
morning
,
while
you
and
your
accomplice
were
talking
together
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
D'Arbino
had
been
watching
Brigida
's
face
intently
from
the
moment
of
Nanina
's
appearance
,
and
had
quietly
stolen
close
to
her
side
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
fortunate
movement
;
for
the
doctor
's
last
words
were
hardly
out
of
his
mouth
before
Brigida
seized
a
heavy
ruler
lying
,
with
some
writing
materials
,
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
,
if
D'Arbino
had
not
caught
her
arm
,
she
would
have
hurled
it
at
Nanina
's
head
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
let
go
your
hold
,
sir
,
"
she
said
,
dropping
the
ruler
,
and
turning
toward
D'Arbino
with
a
smile
on
her
white
lips
and
a
wicked
calmness
in
her
steady
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
wait
for
a
better
opportunity
.
"
  
<EOS>
With
those
words
she
walked
to
the
door
;
and
,
turning
round
there
,
regarded
Nanina
fixedly
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
had
been
a
moment
quicker
with
the
ruler
,
"
she
said
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
"
There
!
"
exclaimed
the
doctor
;
"
I
told
you
I
knew
how
to
deal
with
her
as
she
deserved
.
<EOS>
One
thing
I
am
certainly
obliged
to
her
for
 
<EOS>
she
has
saved
us
the
trouble
of
going
to
her
house
and
forcing
her
to
give
up
the
mask
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
my
child
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Nanina
,
"
you
can
go
home
,
and
one
of
the
men
-
servants
shall
see
you
safe
to
your
own
door
,
in
case
that
woman
should
still
be
lurking
about
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Stop
!
<EOS>
you
are
leaving
the
bag
of
scudi
behind
you
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
ca
n't
take
it
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
why
not
?
"
  
"
She
would
have
taken
money
!
"
<EOS>
Saying
those
words
,
Nanina
reddened
,
and
looked
toward
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
glanced
approvingly
at
D'Arbino
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
we
wo
n't
argue
about
that
now
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
lock
up
the
money
with
the
mask
for
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
Come
here
to
-
morrow
morning
as
usual
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
I
shall
have
made
up
my
mind
on
the
right
means
for
breaking
your
discovery
to
Count
Fabio
.
<EOS>
Only
let
us
proceed
slowly
and
cautiously
,
and
I
answer
for
success
.
<EOS>
"
  
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
among
the
first
visitors
at
the
Ascoli
Palace
was
the
master
-
sculptor
,
Luca
Lomi
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
,
as
the
servants
thought
,
agitated
,
and
said
he
was
especially
desirous
of
seeing
Count
Fabio
.
<EOS>
On
being
informed
that
this
was
impossible
,
he
reflected
a
little
,
and
then
inquired
if
the
medical
attendant
of
the
count
was
at
the
palace
,
and
could
be
spoken
with
.
<EOS>
Both
questions
were
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
he
was
ushered
into
the
doctor
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
to
preface
what
I
want
to
say
,
"
Luca
began
,
looking
about
him
confusedly
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
ask
you
,
in
the
first
place
,
if
the
work
-
girl
named
Nanina
was
here
yesterday
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
was
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
Did
she
speak
in
private
with
any
one
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Yes
;
with
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
you
know
everything
?
<EOS>
"
  
"
<EOS>
Absolutely
everything
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
glad
at
least
to
find
that
my
object
in
wishing
to
see
the
count
can
be
equally
well
answered
by
seeing
you
.
<EOS>
My
brother
,
I
regret
to
say
"
He
stopped
perplexedly
,
and
drew
from
his
pocket
a
roll
of
papers
.
  
<EOS>
"
You
may
speak
of
your
brother
in
the
plainest
terms
,
"
said
the
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
what
share
he
has
had
in
promoting
the
infamous
conspiracy
of
the
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
My
petition
to
you
,
and
through
you
to
the
count
,
is
,
that
your
knowledge
of
what
my
brother
has
done
may
go
no
further
.
<EOS>
If
this
scandal
becomes
public
it
will
ruin
me
in
my
profession
.
<EOS>
And
I
make
little
enough
by
it
already
,
"
said
Luca
,
with
his
old
sordid
smile
breaking
out
again
faintly
on
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
"
Pray
<EOS>
do
you
come
from
your
brother
with
this
petition
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
doctor
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
;
I
come
solely
on
my
own
account
.
<EOS>
My
brother
seems
careless
what
happens
.
<EOS>
He
has
made
a
full
statement
of
his
share
in
the
matter
from
the
first
;
has
forwarded
it
to
his
ecclesiastical
superior
(
who
will
send
it
to
the
archbishop
)
,
and
is
now
awaiting
whatever
sentence
they
choose
to
pass
on
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
copy
of
the
document
,
to
prove
that
he
has
at
least
been
candid
,
and
that
he
does
not
shrink
from
consequences
which
he
might
have
avoided
by
flight
.
<EOS>
The
law
can
not
touch
him
,
but
the
Church
can
 
and
to
the
Church
he
has
confessed
.
<EOS>
All
I
ask
is
,
that
he
may
be
spared
a
public
exposure
.
<EOS>
Such
an
exposure
would
do
no
good
to
the
count
,
and
it
would
do
dreadful
injury
to
me
.
<EOS>
Look
over
the
papers
yourself
,
and
show
them
,
whenever
you
think
proper
,
to
the
master
of
this
house
.
<EOS>
I
have
every
confidence
in
his
honor
and
kindness
,
and
in
yours
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
laid
the
roll
of
papers
open
on
the
table
,
and
then
retired
with
great
humility
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
looked
over
them
with
some
curiosity
.
  
<EOS>
The
statement
or
confession
began
by
boldly
avowing
the
writer
's
conviction
that
part
of
the
property
which
the
Count
Fabio
d'Ascoli
had
inherited
from
his
ancestors
had
been
obtained
by
fraud
and
misrepresentation
from
the
Church
.
<EOS>
The
various
authorities
on
which
this
assertion
was
based
were
then
produced
in
due
order
;
along
with
some
curious
particles
of
evidence
culled
from
old
manuscripts
,
which
it
must
have
cost
much
trouble
to
collect
and
decipher
.
  
<EOS>
The
second
section
was
devoted
,
at
great
length
,
to
the
reasons
which
induced
the
writer
to
think
it
his
absolute
duty
,
as
an
affectionate
son
and
faithful
servant
of
the
Church
,
not
to
rest
until
he
had
restored
to
the
successors
of
the
apostles
in
his
day
the
property
which
had
been
fraudulently
taken
from
them
in
days
gone
by
.
<EOS>
The
writer
held
himself
justified
,
in
the
last
resort
,
and
in
that
only
,
in
using
any
means
for
effecting
this
restoration
,
except
such
as
might
involve
him
in
mortal
sin
.
  
<EOS>
The
third
section
described
the
priest
's
share
in
promoting
the
marriage
of
Maddalena
Lomi
with
Fabio
;
and
the
hopes
he
entertained
of
securing
the
restitution
of
the
Church
property
through
his
influence
over
his
niece
,
in
the
first
place
,
and
,
when
she
had
died
,
through
his
influence
over
her
child
,
in
the
second
.
<EOS>
The
necessary
failure
of
all
his
projects
,
if
Fabio
married
again
,
was
next
glanced
at
;
and
the
time
at
which
the
first
suspicion
of
the
possible
occurrence
of
this
catastrophe
occurred
to
his
mind
was
noted
with
scrupulous
accuracy
.
  
<EOS>
The
fourth
section
narrated
the
manner
in
which
the
conspiracy
of
the
Yellow
Mask
had
originated
.
<EOS>
The
writer
described
himself
as
being
in
his
brother
's
studio
on
the
night
of
his
niece
's
death
,
harassed
by
forebodings
of
the
likelihood
of
Fabio
's
marrying
again
,
and
filled
with
the
resolution
to
prevent
any
such
disastrous
second
union
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
He
asserted
that
the
idea
of
taking
the
wax
mask
from
his
brother
's
statue
flashed
upon
him
on
a
sudden
,
and
that
he
knew
of
nothing
to
lead
to
it
,
except
,
perhaps
,
that
he
had
been
thinking
just
before
of
the
superstitious
nature
of
the
young
man
's
character
,
as
he
had
himself
observed
it
in
the
studio
.
<EOS>
He
further
declared
that
the
idea
of
the
wax
mask
terrified
him
at
first
;
that
he
strove
against
it
as
against
a
temptation
of
the
devil
;
that
,
from
fear
of
yielding
to
this
temptation
,
he
abstained
even
from
entering
the
studio
during
his
brother
's
absence
at
Naples
,
and
that
he
first
faltered
in
his
good
resolution
when
Fabio
returned
to
Pisa
,
and
when
it
was
rumored
,
not
only
that
the
young
nobleman
was
going
to
the
ball
,
but
that
he
would
certainly
marry
for
the
second
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
fifth
section
related
that
the
writer
,
upon
this
,
yielded
to
temptation
rather
than
forego
the
cherished
purpose
of
his
life
by
allowing
Fabio
a
chance
of
marrying
again
 
that
he
made
the
wax
mask
in
a
plaster
mold
taken
from
the
face
of
his
brother
's
statue
 
and
that
he
then
had
two
separate
interviews
with
a
woman
named
Brigida
(
of
whom
he
had
some
previous
knowledge
)
,
who
was
ready
and
anxious
,
from
motives
of
private
malice
,
to
personate
the
deceased
countess
at
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
This
woman
had
suggested
that
some
anonymous
letters
to
Fabio
would
pave
the
way
in
his
mind
for
the
approaching
impersonation
,
and
had
written
the
letters
herself
.
<EOS>
However
,
even
when
all
the
preparations
were
made
,
the
writer
declared
that
he
shrank
from
proceeding
to
extremities
;
and
that
he
would
have
abandoned
the
whole
project
but
for
the
woman
Brigida
informing
him
one
day
that
a
work
-
girl
named
Nanina
was
to
be
one
of
the
attendants
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
count
to
have
been
in
love
with
this
girl
,
even
to
the
point
of
wishing
to
marry
her
;
he
suspected
that
her
engagement
to
wait
at
the
ball
was
preconcerted
;
and
,
in
consequence
,
he
authorized
his
female
accomplice
to
perform
her
part
in
the
conspiracy
.
  
<EOS>
The
sixth
section
detailed
the
proceedings
at
the
masquerade
,
and
contained
the
writer
's
confession
that
,
on
the
night
before
it
,
he
had
written
to
the
count
proposing
the
reconciliation
of
a
difference
that
had
taken
place
between
them
,
solely
for
the
purpose
of
guarding
himself
against
suspicion
.
<EOS>
He
next
acknowledged
that
he
had
borrowed
the
key
of
the
Campo
Santo
gate
,
keeping
the
authority
to
whom
it
was
intrusted
in
perfect
ignorance
of
the
purpose
for
which
he
wanted
it
.
<EOS>
That
purpose
was
to
carry
out
the
ghastly
delusion
of
the
wax
mask
(
in
the
very
probable
event
of
the
wearer
being
followed
and
inquired
after
)
by
having
the
woman
Brigida
taken
up
and
set
down
at
the
gate
of
the
cemetery
in
which
Fabio
's
wife
had
been
buried
.
  
<EOS>
The
seventh
section
solemnly
averred
that
the
sole
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
to
prevent
the
young
nobleman
from
marrying
again
,
by
working
on
his
superstitious
fears
;
the
writer
repeating
,
after
this
avowal
,
that
any
such
second
marriage
would
necessarily
destroy
his
project
for
promoting
the
ultimate
restoration
of
the
Church
possessions
,
by
diverting
Count
Fabio
's
property
,
in
great
part
,
from
his
first
wife
's
child
,
over
whom
the
priest
would
always
have
influence
,
to
another
wife
and
probably
other
children
,
over
whom
he
could
hope
to
have
none
.
  
<EOS>
The
eighth
and
last
section
expressed
the
writer
's
contrition
for
having
allowed
his
zeal
for
the
Church
to
mislead
him
into
actions
liable
to
bring
scandal
on
his
cloth
;
reiterated
in
the
strongest
language
his
conviction
that
,
whatever
might
be
thought
of
the
means
employed
,
the
end
he
had
proposed
to
himself
was
a
most
righteous
one
;
and
concluded
by
asserting
his
resolution
to
suffer
with
humility
any
penalties
,
however
severe
,
which
his
ecclesiastical
superiors
might
think
fit
to
inflict
on
him
.
  
<EOS>
Having
looked
over
this
extraordinary
statement
,
the
doctor
addressed
himself
again
to
Luca
Lomi
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
agree
with
you
,
"
he
said
,
"
that
no
useful
end
is
to
be
gained
now
by
mentioning
your
brother
's
conduct
in
public
 
always
provided
,
however
,
that
his
ecclesiastical
superiors
do
their
duty
.
<EOS>
I
shall
show
these
papers
to
the
count
as
soon
as
he
is
fit
to
peruse
them
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
be
ready
to
take
my
view
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
This
assurance
relieved
Luca
Lomi
of
a
great
weight
of
anxiety
.
<EOS>
He
bowed
and
withdrew
.
  
<EOS>
The
doctor
placed
the
papers
in
the
same
cabinet
in
which
he
had
secured
the
wax
mask
.
<EOS>
Before
he
locked
the
doors
again
he
took
out
the
flat
box
,
opened
it
,
and
looked
thoughtfully
for
a
few
minutes
at
the
mask
inside
,
then
sent
for
Nanina
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
my
child
,
"
he
said
,
when
she
appeared
,
"
I
am
going
to
try
our
first
experiment
with
Count
Fabio
;
and
I
think
it
of
great
importance
that
you
should
be
present
while
I
speak
to
him
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
took
up
the
box
with
the
mask
in
it
,
and
beckoning
to
Nanina
to
follow
him
,
led
the
way
to
Fabio
's
chamber
.
  
.
  
<EOS>
About
six
months
after
the
events
already
related
,
Signor
Andrea
D'Arbino
and
the
Cavaliere
Finello
happened
to
be
staying
with
a
friend
,
in
a
seaside
villa
on
the
Castellamare
shore
of
the
bay
of
Naples
.
<EOS>
Most
of
their
time
was
pleasantly
occupied
on
the
sea
,
in
fishing
and
sailing
.
<EOS>
A
boat
was
placed
entirely
at
their
disposal
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
they
loitered
whole
days
along
the
shore
;
sometimes
made
trips
to
the
lovely
islands
in
the
bay
.
  
<EOS>
One
evening
they
were
sailing
near
Sorrento
,
with
a
light
wind
.
<EOS>
The
beauty
of
the
coast
tempted
them
to
keep
the
boat
close
inshore
.
<EOS>
A
short
time
before
sunset
,
they
rounded
the
most
picturesque
headland
they
had
yet
passed
;
and
a
little
bay
,
with
a
white
-
sand
beach
,
opened
on
their
view
.
<EOS>
They
noticed
first
a
villa
surrounded
by
orange
and
olive
trees
on
the
rocky
heights
inland
;
then
a
path
in
the
cliff
-
side
leading
down
to
the
sands
;
then
a
little
family
party
on
the
beach
,
enjoying
the
fragrant
evening
air
.
  
<EOS>
The
elders
of
the
group
were
a
lady
and
gentleman
,
sitting
together
on
the
sand
.
<EOS>
The
lady
had
a
guitar
in
her
lap
and
was
playing
a
simple
dance
melody
.
<EOS>
Close
at
her
side
a
young
child
was
rolling
on
the
beach
in
high
glee
;
in
front
of
her
a
little
girl
was
dancing
to
the
music
,
with
a
very
extraordinary
partner
in
the
shape
of
a
dog
,
who
was
capering
on
his
hind
legs
in
the
most
grotesque
manner
.
<EOS>
The
merry
laughter
of
the
girl
,
and
the
lively
notes
of
the
guitar
were
heard
distinctly
across
the
still
water
.
  
<EOS>
"
Edge
a
little
nearer
in
shore
,
"
said
D'Arbino
to
his
friend
,
who
was
steering
;
"
and
keep
as
I
do
in
the
shadow
of
the
sail
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
see
the
faces
of
those
persons
on
the
beach
without
being
seen
by
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Finello
obeyed
.
<EOS>
After
approaching
just
near
enough
to
see
the
countenances
of
the
party
on
shore
,
and
to
be
barked
at
lustily
by
the
dog
,
they
turned
the
boat
's
head
again
toward
the
offing
.
  
<EOS>
"
A
pleasant
voyage
,
gentlemen
,
"
cried
the
clear
voice
of
the
little
girl
.
<EOS>
They
waved
their
hats
in
return
;
and
then
saw
her
run
to
the
dog
and
take
him
by
the
forelegs
.
<EOS>
"
Play
,
Nanina
,
"
they
heard
her
say
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
half
done
with
my
partner
yet
.
<EOS>
"
The
guitar
sounded
once
more
,
and
the
grotesque
dog
was
on
his
hind
legs
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
had
heard
that
he
was
well
again
,
that
he
had
married
her
lately
,
and
that
he
was
away
with
her
and
her
sister
,
and
his
child
by
the
first
wife
,
"
said
D'Arbino
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
had
no
suspicion
that
their
place
of
retirement
was
so
near
us
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
soon
to
break
in
upon
their
happiness
,
or
I
should
have
felt
inclined
to
run
the
boat
on
shore
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
never
heard
the
end
of
that
strange
adventure
of
the
Yellow
Mask
,
"
said
Finello
.
<EOS>
"
There
was
a
priest
mixed
up
in
it
,
was
there
not
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
;
but
nobody
seems
to
know
exactly
what
has
become
of
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
sent
for
to
Rome
,
and
has
never
been
heard
of
since
.
<EOS>
One
report
is
,
that
he
has
been
condemned
to
some
mysterious
penal
seclusion
by
his
ecclesiastical
superiors
 
another
,
that
he
has
volunteered
,
as
a
sort
of
Forlorn
Hope
,
to
accept
a
colonial
curacy
among
rough
people
,
and
in
a
pestilential
climate
.
<EOS>
I
asked
his
brother
,
the
sculptor
,
about
him
a
little
while
ago
,
but
he
only
shook
his
head
,
and
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
And
the
woman
who
wore
the
yellow
mask
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
She
,
too
,
has
ended
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
At
Pisa
she
was
obliged
to
sell
off
everything
she
possessed
to
pay
her
debts

Some
friends
of
hers
at
a
milliner
's
shop
,
to
whom
she
applied
for
help
,
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
left
the
city
,
alone
and
penniless
.

The
boat
had
approached
the
next
headland
on
the
coast
while
they
were
talking
They
looked
back
for
a
last
glance
at
the
beach
.
<EOS>
Still
the
notes
of
the
guitar
came
gently
across
the
quiet
water
;
but
there
mingled
with
them
now
the
sound
of
the
lady
's
voice
.
<EOS>
She
was
singing
.
<EOS>
The
little
girl
and
the
dog
were
at
her
feet
,
and
the
gentleman
was
still
in
his
old
place
close
at
her
side
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
more
the
boat
rounded
the
next
headland
,
the
beach
vanished
from
view
,
and
the
music
died
away
softly
in
the
distance
.

LAST
LEAVES
FROM
LEAH
'S
DIARY
.
  
<EOS>
3d
of
June
.
 
<EOS>
Our
stories
are
ended
;
our
pleasant
work
is
done
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
lovely
summer
afternoon
.
<EOS>
The
great
hall
at
the
farmhouse
,
after
having
been
filled
with
people
,
is
now
quite
deserted
.
<EOS>
I
sit
alone
at
my
little
work
-
table
,
with
rather
a
crying
sensation
at
my
heart
,
and
with
the
pen
trembling
in
my
fingers
,
as
if
I
was
an
old
woman
already
.
<EOS>
Our
manuscript
has
been
sealed
up
and
taken
away
;
the
one
precious
object
of
all
our
most
anxious
thoughts
for
months
past
 
our
third
child
,
as
we
have
got
to
call
it
 
has
gone
out
from
us
on
this
summer
's
day
,
to
seek
its
fortune
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
A
little
before
twelve
o'clock
last
night
,
my
husband
dictated
to
me
the
last
words
of
"
The
Yellow
Mask
.
<EOS>
"
I
laid
down
the
pen
,
and
closed
the
paper
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
With
that
simple
action
the
work
that
we
had
wrought
at
together
so
carefully
and
so
long
came
to
a
close
.
<EOS>
We
were
both
so
silent
and
still
,
that
the
murmuring
of
the
trees
in
the
night
air
sounded
audibly
and
solemnly
in
our
room
.
  
<EOS>
William
's
collection
of
stories
has
not
,
thus
far
,
been
half
exhausted
yet
;
but
those
who
understand
the
public
taste
and
the
interests
of
bookselling
better
than
we
,
think
it
advisable
not
to
risk
offering
too
much
to
the
reader
at
first
.
<EOS>
If
individual
opinions
can
be
accepted
as
a
fair
test
,
our
prospects
of
success
seem
hopeful
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
(
but
we
must
not
forget
that
he
is
a
friend
)
was
so
pleased
with
the
two
specimen
stories
we
sent
to
him
,
that
he
took
them
at
once
to
his
friend
,
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
,
who
showed
his
appreciation
of
what
he
read
in
a
very
gratifying
manner
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
that
William
should
publish
in
the
newspaper
,
on
very
fair
terms
,
any
short
anecdotes
and
curious
experiences
of
his
life
as
a
portrait
-
painter
,
which
might
not
be
important
enough
to
put
into
a
book
.
<EOS>
The
money
which
my
husband
has
gained
from
time
to
time
in
this
way
has
just
sufficed
to
pay
our
expenses
at
the
farmhouse
up
to
within
the
last
month
;
and
now
our
excellent
friends
here
say
they
will
not
hear
anything
more
from
us
on
the
subject
of
the
rent
until
the
book
is
sold
and
we
have
plenty
of
money
.
<EOS>
This
is
one
great
relief
and
happiness
.
<EOS>
Another
,
for
which
I
feel
even
more
grateful
,
is
that
William
's
eyes
have
gained
so
much
by
their
long
rest
,
that
even
the
doctor
is
surprised
at
the
progress
he
has
made
.
<EOS>
He
only
puts
on
his
green
shade
now
when
he
goes
out
into
the
sun
,
or
when
the
candles
are
lit
.
<EOS>
His
spirits
are
infinitely
raised
,
and
he
is
beginning
to
talk
already
of
the
time
when
he
will
unpack
his
palette
and
brushes
,
and
take
to
his
old
portrait
-
painting
occupations
again
.
  
<EOS>
With
all
these
reasons
for
being
happy
,
it
seems
unreasonable
and
ungracious
in
me
to
be
feeling
sad
,
as
I
do
just
at
this
moment
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
say
,
in
my
own
justification
,
that
it
is
a
mournful
ceremony
to
take
leave
of
an
old
friend
;
and
I
have
taken
leave
twice
over
of
the
book
that
has
been
like
an
old
friend
to
me
 
once
when
I
had
written
the
last
word
in
it
,
and
once
again
when
I
saw
it
carried
away
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
I
packed
the
manuscript
up
with
my
own
hands
this
morning
,
in
thick
brown
paper
,
wasting
a
great
deal
of
sealing
-
wax
<EOS>
,
I
am
afraid
,
in
my
anxiety
to
keep
the
parcel
from
bursting
open
in
case
it
should
be
knocked
about
on
its
journey
to
town
.
<EOS>
Oh
me
,
how
cheap
and
common
it
looked
,
in
its
new
form
,
as
I
carried
it
downstairs
!
<EOS>
A
dozen
pairs
of
worsted
stockings
would
have
made
a
larger
parcel
;
and
half
a
crown
's
worth
of
groceries
would
have
weighed
a
great
deal
heavier
.
  
<EOS>
Just
as
we
had
done
dinner
the
doctor
and
the
editor
came
in
.
<EOS>
The
first
had
called
to
fetch
the
parcel
 
<EOS>
I
mean
the
manuscript
;
the
second
had
come
out
with
him
to
Appletreewick
for
a
walk
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
farmer
heard
that
the
book
was
to
be
sent
to
London
,
he
insisted
that
we
should
drink
success
to
it
all
round
.
<EOS>
The
children
,
in
high
glee
,
were
mounted
up
on
the
table
,
with
a
glass
of
currant
-
wine
apiece
;
the
rest
of
us
had
ale
;
the
farmer
proposed
the
toast
,
and
his
sailor
son
led
the
cheers
.
<EOS>
We
all
joined
in
(
the
children
included
)
,
except
the
editor
 
who
,
being
the
only
important
person
of
the
party
,
could
not
,
I
suppose
,
afford
to
compromise
his
dignity
by
making
a
noise
.
<EOS>
He
was
extremely
polite
,
however
,
in
a
lofty
way
,
to
me
,
waving
his
hand
and
bowing
magnificently
every
time
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
This
discomposed
me
a
little
;
and
I
was
still
more
flurried
when
he
said
that
he
had
written
to
the
London
publishers
that
very
day
,
to
prepare
them
for
the
arrival
of
our
book
.
  
<EOS>
"
Do
you
think
they
will
print
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
I
ventured
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
dear
madam
,
you
may
consider
it
settled
,
"
said
the
editor
,
confidently
.
<EOS>
"
The
letter
is
written
 
the
thing
is
done
.
<EOS>
Look
upon
the
book
as
published
already
;
pray
oblige
me
by
looking
upon
the
book
as
published
already
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
the
only
uncertainty
now
is
about
how
the
public
will
receive
it
!
"
<EOS>
said
my
husband
,
fidgeting
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
nervously
at
me
.
  
<EOS>
"
Just
so
,
my
dear
sir
,
just
so
,
"
answered
the
editor
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
depends
upon
the
public
 
everything
,
I
pledge
you
my
word
of
honor
.
"
  
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
look
doubtful
,
Mrs.
Kerby
;
there
is
n't
a
doubt
about
it
,
"
whispered
the
kind
doctor
,
giving
the
manuscript
a
confident
smack
as
he
passed
by
me
with
it
on
his
way
to
the
door
.
  
<EOS>
In
another
minute
he
and
the
editor
,
and
the
poor
cheap
-
looking
brown
paper
parcel
,
were
gone
.
<EOS>
The
others
followed
them
out
,
and
I
was
left
in
the
hall
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Oh
,
Public
!
<EOS>
Public
!
<EOS>
it
all
depends
now
upon
you
!
<EOS>
The
children
are
to
have
new
clothes
from
top
to
toe
;
I
am
to
have
a
black
silk
gown
;
William
is
to
buy
a
beautiful
traveling
color
-
box
;
the
rent
is
to
be
paid
;
all
our
kind
friends
at
the
farmhouse
are
to
have
little
presents
,
and
our
future
way
in
this
hard
world
is
to
be
smoothed
for
us
at
the
outset
,
if
you
will
only
accept
a
poor
painter
's
stories
which
his
wife
has
written
down
for
him
After
Dark
!
