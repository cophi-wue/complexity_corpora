THE
PLOTTheir
searches
are
many
and
severe
.
<EOS>
They
come
either
in
the
night
or
early
in
the
morning
,
and
ever
seek
their
opportunity
,
when
the
Catholics
are
or
would
be
best
occupied
,
or
are
likely
to
be
worse
provided
or
look
for
nothing
.
<EOS>
They
willingliest
come
when
few
are
at
home
to
resist
them
,
that
they
may
rifle
coffers
,
and
do
what
they
list
.
<EOS>
They
lock
up
the
servants
,
and
the
mistress
of
the
house
,
and
the
whole
family
,
in
a
room
by
themselves
,
while
they
,
like
young
princes
,
go
rifling
the
house
at
their
will

MSS.What
a
thing
is
it
for
a
Catholic
gentleman
to
have
his
house
suddenly
beset
on
all
sides
with
a
number
of
men
in
arms
,
both
horse
and
foot
!
<EOS>
and
not
only
his
house
and
gardens
,
and
such
enclosed
places
all
beset
,
but
all
highways
laid
,
for
some
miles
near
unto
him
,
that
none
shall
pass
,
but
they
shall
be
examined
!
<EOS>
Then
are
these
searchers
oft
-
times
so
rude
and
barbarous
,
that
,
if
the
doors
be
not
opened
in
the
instant
they
would
enter
,
they
break
open
the
doors
with
all
violence
,
as
if
they
were
to
sack
a
town
of
enemies
won
by
the
sword
.

AN
EXECUTION
IN
MANCHESTER
,
<EOS>
AT
<EOS>
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
SEVENTEENTH
<EOS>
CENTURYMore
than
two
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
years
ago
,
or
,
to
speak
with
greater
precision
,
in
1605
,
at
the
latter
end
of
June
<EOS>
,
it
was
rumoured
one
morning
in
Manchester
that
two
seminary
priests
,
condemned
at
the
late
assizes
under
the
severe
penal
enactments
then
in
force
against
the
Papists
,
were
about
to
suffer
death
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
Attracted
by
the
report
,
large
crowds
flocked
towards
the
place
of
execution
,
which
,
in
order
to
give
greater
solemnity
to
the
spectacle
,
had
been
fixed
at
the
southern
gate
of
the
old
Collegiate
Church
,
where
a
scaffold
was
erected
.
<EOS>
Near
it
was
a
large
blood
-
stained
block
,
the
use
of
which
will
be
readily
divined
,
and
adjoining
the
block
,
upon
a
heap
of
blazing
coals
,
smoked
a
caldron
filled
with
boiling
pitch
,
intended
to
receive
the
quarters
of
the
miserable
sufferers
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
guarded
by
a
small
band
of
soldiers
,
fully
accoutred
in
corslets
and
morions
,
and
armed
with
swords
,
half
-
pikes
,
and
calivers
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
stood
the
executioner,—a
square
-
built
,
ill
-
favoured
personage
,
busied
in
arranging
a
bundle
of
straw
upon
the
boards
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
buff
jerkin
,
and
had
a
long
-
bladed
,
two
-
edged
knife
thrust
into
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
persons
,
there
was
a
pursuivant,—an
officer
appointed
by
the
Privy
Council
to
make
search
throughout
the
provinces
for
recusants
,
Popish
priests
,
and
other
religious
offenders
.
<EOS>
He
was
occupied
at
this
moment
in
reading
over
a
list
of
suspected
persons
.
<EOS>
Neither
the
executioner
nor
his
companions
appeared
in
the
slightest
degree
impressed
by
the
butcherly
business
about
to
be
enacted
;
for
the
former
whistled
carelessly
as
he
pursued
his
task
,
while
the
latter
laughed
and
chatted
with
the
crowd
,
or
jestingly
pointed
their
matchlocks
at
the
jackdaws
wheeling
above
them
in
the
sunny
air
,
or
perching
upon
the
pinnacles
and
tower
of
the
neighbouring
fane
.
<EOS>
Not
so
the
majority
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
older
and
wealthier
families
in
Lancashire
still
continuing
to
adhere
to
the
ancient
faith
of
their
fathers
,
it
will
not
be
wondered
that
many
of
their
dependents
should
follow
their
example
.
<EOS>
And
,
even
of
those
who
were
adverse
to
the
creed
of
Rome
,
there
were
few
who
did
not
murmur
at
the
rigorous
system
of
persecution
adopted
towards
its
professors
.
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
,
the
hollow
rolling
of
a
muffled
drum
was
heard
at
a
distance
.
<EOS>
The
deep
bell
of
the
church
began
to
toll
,
and
presently
afterwards
the
mournful
procession
was
seen
advancing
from
the
market
-
place
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
troop
of
mounted
soldiers
,
equipped
in
all
respects
like
those
stationed
at
the
scaffold
,
with
their
captain
at
their
head
,
and
followed
by
two
of
their
number
with
hurdles
attached
to
their
steeds
,
on
which
were
tied
the
unfortunate
victims
.
<EOS>
Both
were
young
men
—
both
apparently
prepared
to
meet
their
fate
with
firmness
and
resignation
.
<EOS>
They
had
been
brought
from
Radcliffe
Hall
—
an
old
moated
and
fortified
mansion
belonging
to
a
wealthy
family
of
that
name
,
situated
where
the
close
,
called
Pool
Fold
,
now
stands
,
and
then
recently
converted
into
a
place
of
security
for
recusants
;
the
two
other
prisons
in
Manchester
—
namely
,
the
New
Fleet
on
Hunt
's
Bank
,
and
the
gaol
on
Salford
Bridge,—not
being
found
adequate
to
the
accommodation
of
the
numerous
religious
offenders
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
cavalcade
had
reached
the
place
of
execution
.
<EOS>
The
soldiers
drove
back
the
throng
with
their
pikes
,
and
cleared
a
space
in
front
of
the
scaffold
;
when
,
just
as
the
cords
that
bound
the
limbs
of
the
priests
were
unfastened
,
a
woman
in
a
tattered
woollen
robe
,
with
a
hood
partially
drawn
over
her
face,—the
features
of
which
,
so
far
as
they
could
be
discerned
,
were
sharp
and
attenuated,—a
rope
girded
round
her
waist
,
bare
feet
,
and
having
altogether
the
appearance
of
a
sister
of
Charity
,
sprang
forward
,
and
flung
herself
on
her
knees
beside
them
.
<EOS>
Clasping
the
hem
of
the
garment
of
the
nearest
priest
,
she
pressed
it
to
her
lips
,
and
gazed
earnestly
at
him
,
as
if
imploring
a
blessing
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
your
wish
,
daughter
,
"
said
the
priest
,
extending
his
arms
over
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
and
our
lady
bless
you!"The
<EOS>
woman
then
turned
towards
the
other
victim
,
who
was
audibly
reciting
the
Miserere
.
<EOS>
"Back
,
spawn
of
Antichrist
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
a
soldier
,
rudely
thrusting
her
aside
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
see
you
disturb
the
father
's
devotions
?
<EOS>
He
has
enough
to
do
to
take
care
of
his
own
soul
,
without
minding
yours
.
<EOS>
""Take
this
,
daughter
,
"
cried
the
priest
who
had
been
first
addressed
,
offering
her
a
small
volume
,
which
he
took
from
his
vest
,
"
and
fail
not
to
remember
in
your
prayers
the
sinful
soul
of
Robert
Woodroofe
,
a
brother
of
the
order
of
Jesus
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
woman
put
out
her
hand
to
take
the
book
;
but
before
it
could
be
delivered
to
her
,
it
was
seized
by
the
soldier
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
priests
have
seldom
anything
to
leave
behind
them
,
"
he
shouted
,
with
a
brutal
laugh
,
"
except
some
worthless
and
superstitious
relic
of
a
saint
or
martyr
.
<EOS>
What
's
this
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
a
breviary
—
a
mass
-
book
.
<EOS>
I
've
too
much
regard
for
your
spiritual
welfare
to
allow
you
to
receive
it
,
"
he
added
,
about
to
place
it
in
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
"Give
it
her
,
"
exclaimed
a
young
man
,
snatching
it
from
him
,
and
handing
it
to
the
woman
,
who
disappeared
as
soon
as
she
had
obtained
possession
of
it
.
<EOS>
The
soldier
eyed
the
new
-
comer
as
if
disposed
to
resent
the
interference
,
but
a
glance
at
his
apparel
,
which
,
though
plain
,
and
of
a
sober
hue
,
was
rather
above
the
middle
class
,
as
well
as
a
murmur
from
the
crowd
,
who
were
evidently
disposed
to
take
part
with
the
young
man
,
induced
him
to
stay
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
contented
himself
with
crying
,
"
A
recusant
!
<EOS>
a
Papist!""I
am
neither
recusant
nor
Papist
,
knave
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
other
,
sternly
;
"
and
I
counsel
you
to
mend
your
manners
,
and
show
more
humanity
,
or
you
shall
find
I
have
interest
enough
to
procure
your
dismissal
from
a
service
which
you
disgrace
.
<EOS>
"This
reply
elicited
a
shout
of
applause
from
the
mob
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
that
bold
speaker
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
pursuivant
from
one
of
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
"Humphrey
<EOS>
Chetham
of
Crumpsall
,
"
answered
the
man
:
"
son
to
one
of
the
wealthiest
merchants
of
the
town
,
and
a
zealous
upholder
of
the
true
faith
.
<EOS>
""He
has
a
strange
way
of
showing
his
zeal
,
"
rejoined
the
pursuivant
,
entering
the
answer
in
his
note
-
book
.
"
<EOS>
And
who
is
the
woman
he
befriended?""A
half
-
crazed
being
called
Elizabeth
Orton
,
"
replied
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
She
was
scourged
and
tortured
during
Queen
Elizabeth
's
reign
for
pretending
to
the
gift
of
prophecy
,
and
was
compelled
to
utter
her
recantation
within
yonder
church
.
<EOS>
Since
then
she
has
never
opened
her
lips
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
,
"
exclaimed
the
pursuivant
:
"
I
will
engage
to
make
her
speak
,
and
to
some
purpose
.
<EOS>
Where
does
she
live?""In
a
cave
on
the
banks
of
the
Irwell
,
near
Ordsall
Hall
,
"
replied
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
subsists
on
the
chance
contributions
of
the
charitable
;
but
she
solicits
nothing,—and
,
indeed
,
is
seldom
seen
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
cave
must
be
searched
,
"
observed
the
pursuivant
;
"
it
may
be
the
hiding
-
place
of
a
priest
.
<EOS>
Father
Campion
was
concealed
in
such
another
spot
at
Stonor
Park
,
near
Henley
-
on
-
Thames
,
where
he
composed
his
'
Decem
Rationes
;
'
and
,
for
a
long
time
,
eluded
the
vigilance
of
the
commissioners
.
<EOS>
We
shall
pass
it
in
our
way
to
Ordsall
Hall
to
-
night
,
shall
we
not?"The
attendant
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"If
we
surprise
Father
Oldcorne
,
"
continued
the
pursuivant
,
"
and
can
prove
that
Sir
William
Radcliffe
and
his
daughter
,
both
of
whom
are
denounced
in
my
list
,
are
harbourers
and
shelterers
of
recusants
,
we
shall
have
done
a
good
night
's
work
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
,
an
officer
advanced
,
and
commanded
the
priests
to
ascend
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
As
Father
Woodroofe
,
who
was
the
last
to
mount
,
reached
the
uppermost
step
,
he
turned
round
and
cried
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
<EOS>
Good
people
,
I
take
you
all
to
witness
that
I
die
in
the
true
Catholic
religion
,
and
that
I
rejoice
and
thank
God
with
all
my
soul
,
that
he
hath
made
me
worthy
to
testify
my
faith
therein
by
shedding
my
blood
in
this
manner
.
"
<EOS>
He
then
advanced
towards
the
executioner
,
who
was
busied
in
adjusting
the
cord
round
his
companion
's
throat
,
and
said
,
"
God
forgive
thee
—
do
thine
office
quickly
;
"
adding
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
Asperge
me
,
Domine
;
Domine
,
miserere
mei!"And
,
amid
the
deep
silence
that
ensued
,
the
executioner
performed
his
horrible
task
.
<EOS>
The
execution
over
,
the
crowd
began
to
separate
slowly
,
and
various
opinions
were
expressed
respecting
the
revolting
and
sanguinary
spectacle
just
witnessed
.
<EOS>
Many
,
who
condemned
—
and
the
majority
did
so
—
the
extreme
severity
of
the
laws
by
which
the
unfortunate
priests
had
just
suffered
,
uttered
their
sentiments
with
extreme
caution
;
but
there
were
some
whose
feelings
had
been
too
much
excited
for
prudence
,
and
who
inveighed
loudly
and
bitterly
against
the
spirit
of
religious
persecution
then
prevailing
;
while
a
few
others
of
an
entirely
opposite
persuasion
looked
upon
the
rigorous
proceedings
adopted
against
the
Papists
,
and
the
punishment
now
inflicted
upon
their
priesthood
,
as
a
just
retribution
for
their
own
severities
during
the
reign
of
Mary
.
<EOS>
In
general
,
the
common
people
entertained
a
strong
prejudice
against
the
Catholic
party,—for
,
as
it
has
been
shrewdly
observed
,
"
they
must
have
some
object
to
hate
;
heretofore
it
was
the
Welsh
,
the
Scots
,
or
the
Spaniards
,
but
now
in
these
latter
times
only
the
Papists
;
"
but
in
Manchester
,
near
which
,
as
has
been
already
stated
,
so
many
old
and
important
families
,
professing
that
religion
,
resided
<EOS>
,
the
case
was
widely
different
;
and
the
mass
of
the
inhabitants
were
favourably
inclined
towards
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
knowledge
of
this
feeling
that
induced
the
commissioners
,
appointed
to
superintend
the
execution
of
the
enactments
against
recusants
,
to
proceed
with
unusual
rigour
in
this
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
state
of
the
Roman
Catholic
party
at
the
period
of
this
history
was
indeed
most
grievous
.
<EOS>
The
hopes
they
had
indulged
of
greater
toleration
on
the
accession
of
James
the
First
,
had
been
entirely
destroyed
.
<EOS>
The
persecutions
,
suspended
during
the
first
year
of
the
reign
of
the
new
monarch
,
were
now
renewed
with
greater
severity
than
ever
;
and
though
their
present
condition
was
deplorable
enough
,
it
was
feared
that
worse
remained
in
store
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
They
bethought
themselves
,
"
writes
Bishop
Goodman
,
"
that
now
their
case
was
far
worse
than
in
the
time
of
Queen
Elizabeth
;
for
they
did
live
in
some
hope
that
after
the
old
woman
's
life
,
they
might
have
some
mitigation
,
and
even
those
who
did
then
persecute
them
were
a
little
more
moderate
,
as
being
doubtful
what
times
might
succeed
,
and
fearing
their
own
case
.
<EOS>
But
,
now
that
they
saw
the
times
settled
,
having
no
hope
of
better
days
,
but
expecting
that
the
uttermost
rigour
of
the
law
should
be
executed
,
they
became
desperate
:
finding
that
by
the
laws
of
the
kingdom
their
own
lives
were
not
secured
,
and
for
the
carrying
over
of
a
priest
into
England
it
was
no
less
than
high
treason
.
<EOS>
A
gentlewoman
was
hanged
only
for
relieving
and
harbouring
a
priest
;
a
citizen
was
hanged
only
for
being
reconciled
to
the
Church
of
Rome
;
besides
,
the
penal
laws
were
such
,
and
so
executed
,
that
they
could
not
subsist
.
<EOS>
What
was
usually
sold
in
shops
and
usually
bought
,
this
the
pursuivant
would
take
away
from
them
as
being
Popish
and
superstitious
.
<EOS>
One
knight
did
affirm
that
in
one
term
he
gave
twenty
nobles
in
rewards
to
the
door
-
keeper
of
the
Attorney
-
General
;
another
did
affirm
,
that
his
third
part
which
remained
unto
him
of
his
estate
did
hardly
serve
for
his
expense
in
law
to
defend
him
from
other
oppressions
;
besides
their
children
to
be
taken
from
home
,
to
be
brought
up
in
another
religion
.
<EOS>
So
they
did
every
way
conclude
that
their
estate
was
desperate
;
they
could
die
but
once
,
and
their
religion
was
more
precious
unto
them
than
their
lives
.
<EOS>
They
did
further
consider
their
misery
;
how
they
were
debarred
in
any
course
of
life
to
help
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
could
not
practise
law,—they
could
not
be
<EOS>
citizens,—they
could
have
no
office
;
they
could
not
breed
up
their
sons
—
none
did
desire
to
match
with
them
;
they
had
neither
fit
marriages
for
their
daughters
,
nor
nunneries
to
put
them
into
;
for
those
few
which
are
beyond
seas
are
not
considerable
in
respect
of
the
number
of
recusants
,
and
none
can
be
admitted
into
them
without
great
sums
of
money
,
which
they
,
being
exhausted
,
could
not
supply
.
<EOS>
The
Spiritual
Court
did
not
cease
to
molest
them
,
to
excommunicate
them
,
then
to
imprison
them
;
and
thereby
they
were
utterly
disenabled
to
sue
for
their
own
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
is
a
faithful
picture
of
the
state
of
the
Catholic
party
at
the
commencement
of
the
reign
of
James
the
First
.
<EOS>
Pressed
down
by
these
intolerable
grievances
,
is
it
to
be
wondered
at
that
the
Papists
should
repine,—or
that
some
among
their
number
,
when
all
other
means
failed
,
should
seek
redress
by
darker
measures
?
<EOS>
By
a
statute
of
Elizabeth
,
all
who
refused
to
conform
to
the
established
religion
were
subjected
to
a
fine
of
twenty
pounds
a
lunar
month
;
and
this
heavy
penalty
,
remitted
,
or
rather
suspended
,
on
the
accession
of
the
new
sovereign
,
was
again
exacted
,
and
all
arrears
claimed
.
<EOS>
Added
to
this
,
James
,
whose
court
was
thronged
by
a
host
of
needy
Scottish
retainers
,
assigned
to
them
a
certain
number
of
wealthy
recusants
,
and
empowered
them
to
levy
the
fines
—
a
privilege
of
which
they
were
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
.
<EOS>
There
were
other
pains
and
penalties
provided
for
by
the
same
statute
,
which
were
rigorously
inflicted
.
<EOS>
To
withdraw
,
or
seek
to
withdraw
another
from
the
established
religion
was
accounted
high
treason
,
and
punished
accordingly
;
to
hear
mass
involved
a
penalty
of
one
hundred
marks
and
a
year
's
imprisonment
;
and
to
harbour
a
priest
,
under
the
denomination
of
a
tutor
,
rendered
the
latter
liable
to
a
year
's
imprisonment
,
and
his
employer
to
a
fine
of
ten
pounds
a
-
month
.
<EOS>
Impressed
with
the
belief
that
,
in
consequence
of
the
unremitting
persecutions
which
the
Catholics
underwent
in
Elizabeth
's
time
,
the
religion
would
be
wholly
extirpated
,
Doctor
Allen
,
a
Lancashire
divine
,
who
afterwards
received
a
cardinal
's
hat
,
founded
a
college
at
Douay
,
for
the
reception
and
education
of
those
intending
to
take
orders
.
<EOS>
From
this
university
a
number
of
missionary
priests
,
or
seminarists
,
as
they
were
termed
,
were
annually
sent
over
to
England
;
and
it
was
against
these
persons
,
who
submitted
to
every
hardship
and
privation
,
to
danger
,
and
death
itself
,
for
the
welfare
of
their
religion
,
and
in
the
hope
of
propagating
its
doctrines
,
that
the
utmost
rigour
of
the
penal
enactments
was
directed
.
<EOS>
Among
the
number
of
seminarists
despatched
from
Douay
,
and
capitally
convicted
under
the
statute
above
-
mentioned
,
were
the
two
priests
whose
execution
has
just
been
narrated
.
<EOS>
As
a
portion
of
the
crowd
passed
over
the
old
bridge
across
the
Irwell
connecting
Manchester
with
Salford
,
on
which
stood
an
ancient
chapel
erected
by
Thomas
de
Booth
,
in
the
reign
of
Edward
the
Third
,
and
recently
converted
into
a
prison
for
recusants
,
they
perceived
the
prophetess
,
Elizabeth
Orton
,
seated
upon
the
stone
steps
of
the
desecrated
structure
,
earnestly
perusing
the
missal
given
her
by
Father
Woodroofe
.
<EOS>
A
mob
speedily
collected
round
her
;
but
,
unconscious
seemingly
of
their
presence
,
the
poor
woman
turned
over
leaf
after
leaf
,
and
pursued
her
studies
.
<EOS>
Her
hood
was
thrown
back
,
and
discovered
her
bare
and
withered
neck
,
over
which
her
dishevelled
hair
streamed
in
long
sable
elf
-
locks
.
<EOS>
Irritated
by
her
indifference
,
several
of
the
by
-
standers
,
who
had
questioned
her
as
to
the
nature
of
her
studies
,
began
to
mock
and
jeer
her
,
and
endeavoured
,
by
plucking
her
robe
,
and
casting
little
pebbles
at
her
,
to
attract
her
attention
.
<EOS>
Roused
at
length
by
these
annoyances
,
she
arose
;
and
fixing
her
large
black
eyes
menacingly
upon
them
,
was
about
to
stalk
away
,
when
they
surrounded
and
detained
her
.
"Speak
<EOS>
to
us
,
Bess
,
"
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Prophesy
—
prophesy
.
<EOS>
""I
will
speak
to
you
,
"
replied
the
poor
woman
,
shaking
her
hand
at
them
,
"
I
will
prophesy
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
mark
me
,
though
ye
believe
not
,
my
words
shall
not
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
""A
miracle
!
<EOS>
a
miracle
!
"
shouted
the
by
-
standers
.
"
<EOS>
Bess
Orton
,
who
has
been
silent
for
twenty
years
,
has
found
her
tongue
at
last
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
seen
a
vision
,
and
dreamed
a
dream
,
"
continued
the
prophetess
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
lay
in
my
cell
last
night
,
meditating
upon
the
forlorn
state
of
our
religion
,
and
of
its
professors
,
methought
nineteen
shadowy
figures
stood
before
me
—
ay
,
nineteen
—
for
I
counted
them
thrice
—
and
when
I
questioned
them
as
to
their
coming,—for
<EOS>
my
tongue
at
first
clove
to
the
roof
of
my
mouth
,
and
<EOS>
my
lips
refused
their
office,—one
of
them
answered
,
in
a
voice
which
yet
rings
in
my
ears
,
'
We
are
the
chosen
deliverers
of
our
fallen
and
persecuted
church
.
<EOS>
To
us
is
intrusted
the
rebuilding
of
her
temples,—to
our
hands
is
committed
the
destruction
of
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
The
work
will
be
done
in
darkness
and
in
secret,—with
toil
and
travail,—but
it
will
at
length
be
made
manifest
;
and
when
the
hour
is
arrived
,
our
vengeance
will
be
terrible
and
exterminating
.
'
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
they
vanished
from
my
sight
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
suddenly
starting
,
and
passing
her
hand
across
her
brow
,
as
if
to
clear
her
sight
,
"
it
was
no
dream
—
no
vision
.
<EOS>
I
see
one
of
them
now
.
<EOS>
""Where
?
<EOS>
where
?
"
cried
several
voices
.
<EOS>
The
prophetess
answered
by
extending
her
skinny
arm
towards
some
object
immediately
before
her
.
<EOS>
All
eyes
were
instantly
turned
in
the
same
direction
,
when
they
beheld
a
Spanish
soldier
—
for
such
his
garb
proclaimed
him
—
standing
at
a
few
paces
'
distance
from
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
wrapped
in
an
ample
cloak
,
with
a
broad
-
leaved
steeple
-
crowned
hat
,
decorated
with
a
single
green
feather
,
pulled
over
his
brows
,
and
wore
a
polished
-
steel
brigandine
,
trunk
hose
,
and
buff
boots
drawn
up
to
the
knees
.
<EOS>
His
arms
consisted
of
a
brace
of
petronels
thrust
into
his
belt
,
whence
a
long
rapier
depended
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
dark
as
bronze
,
and
well
-
formed
,
though
strongly
marked
,
and
had
an
expression
of
settled
sternness
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
grey
and
penetrating
,
and
shaded
by
thick
beetle
-
brows
;
and
his
physiognomy
was
completed
by
a
black
peaked
beard
.
<EOS>
His
person
was
tall
and
erect
,
and
his
deportment
soldier
-
like
and
commanding
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
<EOS>
he
had
become
an
object
of
notice
,
the
stranger
cast
a
compassionate
look
at
the
prophetess
,
who
still
remained
gazing
fixedly
at
him
,
and
throwing
her
a
few
pieces
of
money
,
strode
away
.
<EOS>
Watching
his
retreating
figure
till
it
disappeared
from
view
,
the
crazed
woman
tossed
her
arms
wildly
in
the
air
,
and
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
exultation
,
"
Did
I
not
speak
the
truth?—did
<EOS>
I
not
tell
you
I
had
seen
him
?
<EOS>
He
is
the
deliverer
of
our
church
,
and
is
come
to
avenge
the
righteous
blood
<EOS>
which
hath
been
this
day
shed
.
<EOS>
""Peace
,
woman
,
and
fly
while
there
is
yet
time
,
"
cried
the
young
man
who
had
been
designated
as
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
pursuivant
and
his
myrmidons
are
in
search
of
you
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
they
need
not
go
far
to
find
me
,
"
replied
the
prophetess
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
them
what
I
told
these
people
,
that
the
day
of
bloody
retribution
is
at
hand,—that
the
avenger
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
twice,—once
in
my
cave
,
and
once
again
here,—even
where
you
stand
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
do
not
keep
silence
and
fly
,
my
poor
creature
,
"
rejoined
Humphrey
Chetham
,
"
you
will
have
to
endure
what
you
suffered
years
ago,—stripes
,
and
perhaps
torture
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
by
me
—
ah
!
<EOS>
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
is
approaching
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
come
,
"
replied
Elizabeth
Orton
,
"
I
am
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
none
of
you
force
her
away
?
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
,
appealing
to
the
crowd
;
"
I
will
reward
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
stir
from
this
spot
,
"
rejoined
the
prophetess
,
obstinately
;
"
I
will
testify
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"The
kind
-
hearted
young
merchant
,
finding
any
further
attempt
to
preserve
her
fruitless
,
drew
aside
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
pursuivant
and
his
attendants
had
come
up
.
<EOS>
"
Seize
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
former
,
"
and
let
her
be
placed
within
this
prison
till
I
have
reported
her
to
the
commissioners
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
confess
to
me
,
woman
,
"
he
added
in
a
whisper
to
her
,
"
that
you
have
harboured
a
priest
,
and
will
guide
us
to
his
hiding
-
place
,
you
shall
be
set
free
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
of
no
priests
but
those
you
have
murdered
,
"
returned
the
prophetess
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
but
I
will
tell
you
something
that
you
wot
not
of
.
<EOS>
The
avenger
of
blood
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
.
<EOS>
All
here
have
seen
him
.
<EOS>
And
you
shall
see
him
—
but
not
now
—
not
now
.
<EOS>
""What
is
the
meaning
of
this
raving
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
"Pay
<EOS>
no
heed
to
her
talk
<EOS>
,
"
interposed
Humphrey
Chetham
;
"
she
is
a
poor
crazed
being
,
who
knows
not
what
she
says
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
surety
for
her
inoffensive
conduct
.
<EOS>
""You
must
give
me
surety
for
yourself
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
learnt
that
you
were
last
night
at
Ordsall
Hall
,
the
seat
of
that
'
dangerous
<EOS>
temporiser,'—for
<EOS>
so
he
is
designated
in
my
warrant,—Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
And
if
report
speaks
truly
,
you
are
not
altogether
insensible
to
the
charms
of
his
fair
daughter
,
Viviana
.
<EOS>
""What
is
this
to
thee
,
thou
malapert
knave
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
,
reddening
,
partly
from
anger
,
partly
,
it
might
be
,
from
another
emotion
.
<EOS>
"Much
,
as
you
shall
presently
find
,
good
Master
Wolf
-
in
-
sheep's
-
clothing
,
"
retorted
the
pursuivant
;
"
if
you
prove
not
a
rank
Papist
at
heart
,
then
do
I
not
know
a
true
man
from
a
false
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
angry
conference
was
cut
short
by
a
piercing
scream
from
the
prophetess
.
<EOS>
Breaking
from
the
grasp
of
her
captors
,
who
were
about
to
force
her
into
the
prison
,
she
sprang
with
a
single
bound
upon
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
;
and
utterly
regardless
of
her
dangerous
position
,
turned
,
and
faced
the
soldiers
,
who
were
struck
mute
with
astonishment
.
"Tremble
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
a
loud
voice,—"tremble
,
ye
evil
-
doers
!
<EOS>
Ye
who
have
despoiled
the
house
of
God,—have
broken
his
altars,—scattered
<EOS>
his
incense,—slain
his
priests
.
<EOS>
Tremble
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
The
avenger
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
bolt
is
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
It
shall
strike
king
,
lords
,
commons,—all
!
<EOS>
These
are
my
last
words,—take
them
to
heart
.
<EOS>
""Drag
her
off
!
<EOS>
"
roared
the
pursuivant
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"Use
<EOS>
care
—
use
gentleness
,
if
ye
are
men
!
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
.
"Think
<EOS>
not
you
can
detain
me
!
"
cried
the
prophetess
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Avaunt
,
and
tremble!"So
saying
she
flung
herself
from
the
parapet
.
<EOS>
The
height
from
which
she
fell
was
about
fifty
feet
.
<EOS>
Dashed
into
the
air
like
jets
from
a
fountain
by
the
weight
and
force
of
the
descending
body
,
the
water
instantly
closed
over
her
.
<EOS>
But
she
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
stream
,
about
twenty
yards
below
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"She
may
yet
be
saved
,
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
,
who
with
the
by
-
standers
had
hurried
to
the
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"You
will
only
preserve
her
for
the
gallows
,
"
observed
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
"Your
malice
shall
not
prevent
my
making
the
attempt
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
.
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
assistance
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
soldier
in
the
Spanish
dress
,
who
rushed
towards
the
left
bank
of
the
river
,
which
was
here
,
as
elsewhere
,
formed
of
red
sandstone
rock
,
and
following
the
course
of
the
current
,
awaited
the
next
appearance
of
the
drowning
woman
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
occur
till
she
had
been
carried
a
considerable
distance
down
the
stream
,
when
the
soldier
,
swiftly
divesting
himself
of
his
cloak
,
plunged
into
the
water
,
and
dragged
her
ashore
.
<EOS>
"Follow
<EOS>
me
,
"
cried
the
pursuivant
to
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
lose
my
prey
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
before
he
gained
the
bank
of
the
river
,
the
soldier
and
his
charge
had
disappeared
,
nor
could
he
detect
any
traces
of
them

ORDSALL
CAVEAfter
rescuing
the
unfortunate
prophetess
from
a
watery
grave
in
the
manner
just
related
,
the
soldier
snatched
up
his
cloak
,
and
,
taking
his
dripping
burthen
in
his
arms
,
hurried
swiftly
along
the
bank
of
the
river
,
until
he
came
to
a
large
cleft
in
the
rock
,
into
which
he
crept
,
taking
the
prophetess
with
him
,
and
thus
eluded
observation
.
<EOS>
In
this
retreat
he
continued
upwards
of
two
hours
,
during
which
time
the
poor
creature
,
to
whom
he
paid
every
attention
that
circumstances
would
admit
,
had
so
far
recovered
as
to
be
able
to
speak
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evident
that
the
shock
had
been
too
much
for
her
,
and
that
she
was
sinking
fast
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
faint
that
she
could
scarcely
move
;
but
she
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
reach
her
cell
before
she
breathed
her
last
.
<EOS>
Having
described
its
situation
as
accurately
as
she
could
to
the
soldier
—
who
before
he
ventured
forth
peeped
out
to
reconnoitre
—
he
again
raised
her
in
his
arms
,
and
by
her
direction
struck
into
a
narrow
lane
skirting
the
bank
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
this
road
for
about
half
a
mile
,
he
arrived
at
the
foot
of
a
small
knoll
,
covered
by
a
clump
of
magnificent
beech
-
trees
,
and
still
acting
under
the
guidance
of
the
dying
woman
,
whose
voice
grew
more
feeble
each
instant
,
he
mounted
it
,
and
from
its
summit
took
a
rapid
survey
of
the
surrounding
country
.
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
stood
an
old
hall
,
while
further
on
,
at
some
distance
,
he
could
perceive
through
the
trees
the
gables
and
chimneys
of
another
ancient
mansion
.
<EOS>
"Raise
<EOS>
me
up
<EOS>
,
"
said
Elizabeth
Orton
,
as
he
lingered
on
this
spot
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
that
old
house
,
which
you
see
yonder
,
Hulme
Hall
,
I
was
born
.
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
take
one
look
at
it
before
I
die
.
"Illustration"And
<EOS>
the
other
hall
,
which
I
discern
through
the
trees
,
is
Ordsall
,
is
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
soldier
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
the
prophetess
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
make
what
haste
we
can
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
far
to
go
;
and
I
feel
I
shall
not
last
long
.
<EOS>
"Descending
<EOS>
the
eminence
,
and
again
entering
the
lane
,
which
here
made
a
turn
<EOS>
,
the
soldier
approached
a
grassy
space
,
walled
in
on
either
side
by
steep
sandstone
rocks
.
<EOS>
At
the
further
extremity
of
the
enclosure
,
after
a
moment
's
search
,
by
the
direction
of
his
companion
,
he
found
,
artfully
concealed
by
overhanging
brushwood
,
the
mouth
of
a
small
cave
.
<EOS>
He
crept
into
the
excavation
,
and
found
it
about
six
feet
high
,
and
of
considerable
depth
.
<EOS>
The
roof
was
ornamented
with
Runic
characters
and
other
grotesque
and
half
-
effaced
inscriptions
,
while
the
sides
were
embellished
with
Gothic
tracery
,
amid
which
the
letters
I.H.S.
,
carved
in
ancient
church
text
,
could
be
easily
distinguished
.
<EOS>
Tradition
assigned
the
cell
to
the
priests
of
Odin
,
but
it
was
evident
that
worshippers
at
other
and
holier
altars
had
more
recently
made
it
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
Its
present
occupant
had
furnished
it
with
a
straw
pallet
,
and
a
small
wooden
crucifix
fixed
in
a
recess
in
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Gently
depositing
her
upon
the
pallet
,
the
soldier
took
a
seat
beside
her
on
a
stone
slab
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
He
next
,
at
her
request
,
as
the
cave
was
rendered
almost
wholly
dark
by
the
overhanging
trees
,
struck
a
light
,
and
set
fire
to
a
candle
placed
within
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
moments
passed
in
prayer
,
the
recluse
begged
him
to
give
her
the
crucifix
that
she
might
clasp
it
to
her
breast
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
became
more
composed
,
and
prepared
to
meet
her
end
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
if
something
had
again
disturbed
her
,
she
opened
wide
her
glazing
eyes
,
and
starting
up
with
a
dying
effort
,
stretched
out
her
hands
.
<EOS>
"I
see
him
before
them
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
They
examine
him
—
they
adjudge
him
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
he
is
now
in
a
dungeon
!
<EOS>
See
,
the
torturers
advance
!
<EOS>
He
is
placed
on
the
rack
—
once
—
twice
—
<EOS>
thrice
<EOS>
—
they
turn
the
levers
!
<EOS>
His
joints
snap
in
their
sockets
—
his
sinews
crack
!
<EOS>
Mercy
!
<EOS>
he
confesses
!
<EOS>
He
is
led
to
execution
.
<EOS>
I
see
him
ascend
the
scaffold!""Whom
<EOS>
do
you
behold
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
soldier
,
listening
to
her
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
face
is
hidden
from
me
,
"
replied
the
prophetess
;
"
but
his
figure
is
not
unlike
your
own
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
I
hear
the
executioner
pronounce
his
name
.
<EOS>
How
are
you
called?""GUY
FAWKES
,
"
replied
the
soldier
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
name
I
heard
,
"
rejoined
Elizabeth
Orton
.
<EOS>
And
,
sinking
backward
,
she
expired
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
gazed
at
her
for
some
time
,
till
he
felt
assured
that
the
last
spark
of
life
had
fled
.
<EOS>
He
then
turned
away
,
and
placing
his
hand
upon
his
chin
,
became
lost
in
deep
reflection
.

ORDSALL
HALLSoon
after
sunset
,
on
the
evening
of
the
events
previously
related
,
the
inmates
of
Ordsall
Hall
were
disturbed
and
alarmed
(
for
in
those
times
of
trouble
any
casual
disturbance
at
night
was
sufficient
to
occasion
alarm
to
a
Catholic
family
)
by
a
loud
clamour
for
admittance
from
some
one
stationed
at
the
farther
side
of
the
moat
,
then
,
as
now
,
surrounding
that
ancient
manorial
residence
.
<EOS>
The
drawbridge
being
raised
,
no
apprehension
was
entertained
of
an
attempt
at
forcible
entrance
on
the
part
of
the
intruder
,
who
,
so
far
as
he
could
be
discerned
in
the
deepening
twilight
,
rendered
yet
more
obscure
by
the
shade
of
the
trees
under
which
he
stood
,
appeared
to
be
a
solitary
horseman
.
<EOS>
Still
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
,
it
was
judged
prudent
by
those
inside
the
hall
to
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
the
summons
;
nor
was
it
until
it
had
been
more
than
once
repeated
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
that
any
attention
was
paid
to
it
.
<EOS>
The
outer
gate
was
then
cautiously
opened
by
an
old
steward
,
and
a
couple
of
serving
-
men
,
armed
with
pikes
and
swords
,
who
demanded
the
stranger
's
business
,
and
were
answered
that
he
desired
to
speak
with
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
The
steward
rejoined
that
his
master
was
not
at
home
,
having
set
out
the
day
before
for
Chester
:
but
that
even
if
he
were
,
he
would
take
upon
himself
to
affirm
that
no
audience
would
be
given
,
on
any
pretence
whatever
,
to
a
stranger
at
such
an
unseasonable
hour
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
other
replied
,
in
a
haughty
and
commanding
voice
,
that
he
was
neither
a
stranger
to
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
nor
ignorant
of
the
necessity
of
caution
,
though
in
this
instance
it
was
altogether
superfluous
;
and
as
,
notwithstanding
the
steward
's
assertion
to
the
contrary
,
he
was
fully
persuaded
his
master
was
at
home
,
he
insisted
upon
being
conducted
to
him
without
further
parley
,
as
his
business
would
not
brook
delay
.
<EOS>
In
vain
the
steward
declared
he
had
spoken
the
truth
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
evidently
disbelieved
him
;
but
,
as
he
could
obtain
no
more
satisfactory
answer
to
his
interrogations
,
he
suddenly
shifted
his
ground
,
and
inquired
whether
Sir
William
's
daughter
,
Mistress
Viviana
,
was
likewise
absent
from
home
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
I
reply
to
the
question
,
I
must
know
by
whom
and
wherefore
it
is
put
?
"
returned
the
steward
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"Trouble
<EOS>
not
yourself
further
,
friend
,
but
deliver
this
letter
to
her
,
"
rejoined
the
horseman
,
flinging
a
packet
across
the
moat
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
addressed
to
her
father
,
but
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
acquainted
with
its
contents
.
<EOS>
""Take
it
up
<EOS>
,
Olin
Birtwissel
,
"
cried
the
steward
,
eyeing
the
packet
which
had
fallen
at
his
feet
suspiciously
;
"
take
it
up
,
I
say
,
and
hold
it
to
the
light
,
that
I
may
consider
it
well
before
I
carry
it
to
our
young
mistress
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
of
strange
treacheries
practised
by
such
means
,
and
care
not
to
meddle
with
it
.
<EOS>
""Neither
<EOS>
do
I
,
good
Master
Heydocke
,
"
replied
Birtwissel
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
touch
it
for
a
twelvemonth
's
wages
.
<EOS>
It
may
burst
,
and
spoil
my
good
looks
,
and
so
ruin
my
fortunes
with
the
damsels
.
<EOS>
But
here
is
Jeff
Gellibronde
,
who
,
having
no
beauty
to
lose
,
and
being
,
moreover
,
afraid
of
nothing
,
will
pick
it
up
for
you
.
<EOS>
""Speak
<EOS>
for
yourself
,
Olin
,
"
rejoined
Gellibronde
,
in
a
surly
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
more
fancy
for
a
shattered
limb
,
or
a
scorched
face
,
than
my
neighbours
.
<EOS>
""Dolts
!
"
cried
the
stranger
,
who
had
listened
to
these
observations
with
angry
impatience
,
"
if
you
will
not
convey
my
packet
,
which
has
nothing
more
dangerous
about
it
than
an
ordinary
letter
,
to
your
mistress
,
at
least
acquaint
her
that
Mr.
Robert
Catesby
,
of
Ashby
St.
Legers
,
is
without
,
and
craves
an
instant
speech
with
her
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
steward
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
be
indeed
your
worship
,
why
did
you
not
declare
yourself
at
once?""I
may
have
as
good
reason
for
caution
as
yourself
,
Master
Heydocke
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
rejoined
the
steward
;
"
but
,
methinks
it
is
somewhat
strange
to
find
your
worship
here
,
when
I
am
aware
that
my
master
expected
to
meet
you
,
and
certain
other
honourable
gentlemen
that
you
wot
of
,
at
a
place
in
a
clean
opposite
direction
,
Holywell
,
in
Flintshire
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
cause
of
my
presence
,
since
you
desire
to
be
certified
of
the
matter
,
is
simply
this
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
urging
his
steed
towards
the
edge
of
the
moat
,
while
the
steward
advanced
to
meet
him
on
the
opposite
bank
,
so
that
a
few
yards
only
lay
between
them
;
"
I
came
round
by
Manchester
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
"
to
see
if
any
assistance
could
be
rendered
to
the
unfortunate
fathers
Woodroofe
and
Forshawe
;
but
found
on
my
arrival
this
morning
that
I
was
too
late
,
as
they
had
just
been
executed
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
have
mercy
on
their
souls
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Heydocke
,
shuddering
,
and
crossing
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Yours
was
a
pious
mission
,
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Would
it
had
been
availing!""I
would
so
,
too
,
with
all
my
soul
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
other
,
fervently
;
"
but
fate
ordained
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
in
the
town
,
I
accidentally
learnt
from
one
,
who
informed
me
he
had
just
parted
with
him
,
that
your
master
was
at
home
;
and
,
fearing
he
might
not
be
able
to
attend
the
meeting
at
Holywell
<EOS>
,
I
resolved
to
proceed
hither
at
nightfall
,
when
my
visit
was
not
likely
to
be
observed
;
having
motives
,
which
you
may
readily
conjecture
,
for
preserving
the
strictest
secrecy
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
letter
was
prepared
in
case
I
should
fail
in
meeting
with
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
that
I
have
satisfied
your
scruples
,
good
master
steward
,
if
Sir
William
be
really
within
,
I
pray
you
lead
me
to
him
forthwith
.
<EOS>
If
not
,
your
young
mistress
may
serve
my
turn
,
for
I
have
that
to
say
which
it
imports
one
or
other
of
them
to
know
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
regard
to
my
master
,
"
replied
the
steward
,
"
he
departed
yesterday
for
Chester
,
on
his
way
to
join
the
pilgrimage
to
<EOS>
St.
Winifred
's
Well
,
as
I
have
already
assured
your
worship
.
<EOS>
And
whoever
informed
you
to
the
contrary
,
spoke
falsely
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
convey
your
letter
and
message
to
my
young
mistress
,
and
on
learning
her
pleasure
as
to
receiving
you
,
will
instantly
return
and
report
it
.
<EOS>
These
are
dangerous
times
,
your
worship
;
dangerous
times
.
<EOS>
A
good
Catholic
knows
not
whom
to
trust
,
there
are
so
many
spoilers
abroad
.
<EOS>
""How
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
angrily
,
"
<EOS>
do
you
apply
that
observation
to
me?""Far
be
it
from
me
,
"
answered
Heydocke
,
respectfully
,
"
to
apply
any
observation
that
may
sound
offensive
to
your
worship
,
whom
I
know
to
be
a
most
worthy
gentleman
,
and
as
free
from
heresy
,
as
any
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
I
was
merely
endeavouring
to
account
for
what
may
appear
my
over
-
caution
in
detaining
you
where
you
are
,
till
I
learn
my
lady
's
pleasure
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
rule
in
this
house
not
to
lower
the
drawbridge
without
orders
after
sunset
;
and
I
dare
not
,
for
my
place
,
disobey
it
.
<EOS>
Young
Mr.
Humphrey
Chetham
,
of
Crumpsall
,
was
detained
in
the
like
manner
no
later
than
last
night
;
and
he
is
a
visitor

"
he
added
,
in
a
significant
tone
,
"
who
is
not
altogether
unwelcome
to
my
mistress
—
ahem
!
<EOS>
But
duty
is
no
respecter
of
persons
;
and
in
my
master
's
absence
my
duty
is
to
protect
his
household

<EOS>
Your
worship
will
pardon
me
.
<EOS>
""I
will
pardon
anything
but
your
loquacity
and
tediousness
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
impatiently
.
"
<EOS>
About
your
errand
quickly
.
<EOS>
""I
am
gone
,
your
worship

"
returned
the
steward
,
disappearing
with
his
companions
.
<EOS>
Throwing
the
bridle
over
his
horse
's
neck
,
and
allowing
him
to
drink
his
fill
from
the
water
of
the
moat
,
and
afterwards
to
pluck
a
few
mouthfuls
of
the
long
grass
that
fringed
its
brink
,
Catesby
abandoned
himself
to
reflection
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
,
as
the
steward
did
not
return
,
he
raised
his
eyes
,
and
fixed
them
upon
the
ancient
habitation
before
him,—ancient
,
indeed
,
it
was
not
at
this
time
,
having
been
in
a
great
measure
rebuilt
by
its
possessor
,
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
during
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
Elizabeth
,
in
the
rich
and
picturesque
style
of
that
period
.
<EOS>
Little
could
be
distinguished
of
its
projecting
and
retiring
wings
,
its
walls
decorated
with
black
and
white
chequer
-
work
,
the
characteristic
of
the
class
of
architecture
to
which
it
belonged
,
or
of
its
magnificent
embayed
windows
filled
with
stained
glass
;
but
the
outline
of
its
heavy
roof
,
with
its
numerous
gables
,
and
groups
of
tall
and
elaborately
-
ornamented
chimneys
,
might
be
distinctly
traced
in
strong
relief
against
the
warm
and
still
-
glowing
western
sky
.
<EOS>
Though
much
gone
to
decay
,
grievously
neglected
,
and
divided
into
three
separate
dwelling
-
houses
,
Ordsall
Hall
still
retains
much
of
its
original
character
and
beauty
;
and
viewed
at
the
magic
hour
above
described
,
when
the
changes
produced
by
the
lapse
of
years
can
not
be
detected
,
it
presents
much
the
same
striking
appearance
that
it
offered
to
the
gaze
of
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Situated
on
the
north
bank
of
the
Irwell
,
which
supplies
the
moat
with
a
constant
stream
of
fresh
water
,
it
commands
on
the
south
-
west
a
beautiful
view
of
the
winding
course
of
the
river
,
here
almost
forming
an
island
,
of
Trafford
Park
and
its
hall
,
of
the
woody
uplands
beyond
it
,
and
of
the
distant
hills
of
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
The
mansion
itself
is
an
irregular
quadrangle
,
covering
a
considerable
tract
of
ground
.
<EOS>
The
gardens
,
once
exquisitely
laid
out
in
the
formal
taste
of
Elizabeth
's
days
,
are
also
enclosed
by
the
moat
,
surrounding
(
except
in
the
intervals
where
it
is
filled
up
)
a
space
of
some
acres
in
extent
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
this
history
,
it
was
approached
on
the
north
-
east
by
a
noble
avenue
of
sycamores
,
leading
to
within
a
short
distance
of
its
gates
.
<EOS>
As
Catesby
surveyed
this
stately
structure
,
and
pondered
upon
the
wealth
and
power
of
its
owner
,
his
meditations
thus
found
vent
in
words:—"If
I
could
but
link
Radcliffe
to
our
cause
,
or
win
the
hand
of
his
fair
daughter
,
and
so
bind
him
to
me
,
the
great
attempt
could
not
fail
.
<EOS>
She
has
refused
me
once
.
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
I
will
persevere
till
she
yields
.
<EOS>
With
Father
Oldcorne
to
back
my
suit
,
I
am
assured
of
success
.
<EOS>
She
is
necessary
to
my
purpose
,
and
shall
be
mine
.
<EOS>
"Descended
<EOS>
from
an
ancient
Northamptonshire
family
,
and
numbering
among
his
ancestry
the
well
-
known
minister
of
the
same
name
who
flourished
in
the
reign
of
Richard
the
Third
,
Robert
Catesby,—at
this
time
about
forty,—had
in
his
youth
led
a
wild
and
dissolute
life
;
and
though
bred
in
the
faith
of
Rome
,
he
had
for
some
years
abandoned
its
worship
.
<EOS>
In
1580
,
when
the
Jesuits
,
Campion
and
Persons
,
visited
England
,
he
was
reconciled
to
the
church
he
had
quitted
,
and
thenceforth
became
as
zealous
a
supporter
and
promoter
of
its
doctrines
as
he
had
heretofore
been
their
bitter
opponent
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
actively
engaged
in
all
the
Popish
plots
of
the
period
,
and
was
even
supposed
to
be
connected
with
those
designs
of
a
darker
dye
which
were
set
on
foot
for
Elizabeth
's
destruction,—with
Somerville
's
conspiracy,—with
that
of
Arden
and
Throckmorton,—the
latter
of
whom
was
his
uncle
on
the
maternal
side,—with
<EOS>
the
plots
of
Bury
and
Savage,—of
Ballard,—and
of
Babington
.
<EOS>
After
the
execution
of
the
unfortunate
Queen
of
Scots
,
he
devoted
himself
to
what
was
termed
the
Spanish
faction
,
and
endeavoured
carry
out
the
schemes
of
a
party
,
who
,
distrusting
the
vague
promises
of
James
,
were
anxious
to
secure
the
succession
to
a
Catholic,—the
Infanta
of
Spain
,
or
the
Duke
of
Parma
.
<EOS>
On
the
insurrection
of
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
he
took
part
with
that
ill
-
fated
nobleman
;
and
,
though
he
escaped
condign
punishment
for
the
offence
,
he
was
imprisoned
and
heavily
fined
.
<EOS>
From
this
time
his
career
ran
in
darker
channels
.
"
<EOS>
Hunger
-
starved
for
innovation
,
"
as
he
is
finely
described
by
Camden,—imbued
with
the
fiercest
religious
fanaticism,—eloquent
,
wily
,
resolute,—able
alike
to
delude
the
powerful
and
intimidate
the
weak,—he
possessed
all
the
ingredients
of
a
conspirator
.
<EOS>
Associating
with
men
like
himself
,
of
desperate
character
and
broken
fortunes
,
he
was
ever
on
the
look
out
for
some
means
of
retrieving
his
own
condition
,
and
redressing
the
wrongs
of
his
church
.
<EOS>
Well
informed
of
the
actual
state
of
James
's
sentiments
,
when
,
on
that
monarch
's
accession
,
confident
hopes
were
entertained
by
the
Romanists
of
greater
toleration
for
their
religion
,
Catesby
was
the
first
to
point
out
their
mistake
,
and
to
foretel
the
season
of
terrible
persecution
that
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
On
this
persecution
he
grounded
his
hopes
—
hopes
,
never
realized
,
for
the
sufferers
,
amid
all
the
grievances
they
endured
,
remained
constant
in
their
fidelity
to
the
throne
—
of
exciting
a
general
insurrection
among
the
Catholics
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
this
expectation,—disappointed
,
also
,
in
his
hopes
of
Spain
,
of
France
,
and
of
aid
from
Rome
,
he
fell
back
upon
himself
,
and
resolved
upon
the
execution
of
a
dark
and
dreadful
project
which
he
had
long
conceived
,
and
which
he
could
execute
almost
single
-
handed
,
without
aid
from
foreign
powers
,
and
without
the
co
-
operation
of
his
own
party
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
this
project
,
which
,
if
it
succeeded
,
would
,
he
imagined
,
accomplish
all
or
more
than
his
wildest
dreams
of
ambition
or
fanaticism
had
ever
conceived
,
it
will
be
the
business
of
this
history
to
develope
.
<EOS>
Without
going
further
into
detail
at
present
,
it
may
be
mentioned
that
the
success
of
the
plot
depended
so
entirely
on
its
secrecy
,
and
so
well
aware
was
its
contriver
of
the
extraordinary
system
of
espionage
carried
on
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
the
Privy
Council
,
that
for
some
time
he
scarcely
dared
to
trust
it
out
of
his
keeping
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
much
deliberation
,
he
communicated
it
to
five
others
,
all
of
whom
were
bound
to
silence
by
an
oath
of
unusual
solemnity
;
and
as
it
was
necessary
to
the
complete
success
of
the
conspiracy
that
its
outbreak
should
be
instantaneously
followed
by
a
rise
on
the
part
of
the
Catholics
,
he
darkly
hinted
that
a
plan
was
on
foot
for
their
deliverance
from
the
yoke
of
their
oppressors
,
and
counselled
them
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
fly
to
arms
at
a
moment
's
notice
.
<EOS>
But
here
again
he
failed
.
<EOS>
Few
were
disposed
to
listen
to
him
;
and
of
those
who
did
,
the
majority
returned
for
answer
,
"
that
their
part
was
endurance
,
and
that
the
only
arms
which
Christians
could
use
against
lawful
powers
in
their
severity
were
prayers
and
tears
.
<EOS>
"Among
<EOS>
the
Popish
party
of
that
period
,
as
in
our
own
time
,
were
ranked
many
of
the
oldest
and
most
illustrious
families
in
the
kingdom,—families
not
less
remarkable
for
their
zeal
for
their
religion
than
,
as
has
before
been
observed
,
for
their
loyalty;—a
loyalty
afterwards
approved
in
the
disastrous
reign
of
James
the
Second
by
their
firm
adherence
to
what
they
considered
the
indefeasible
right
of
inheritance
.
<EOS>
Plots
,
indeed
,
were
constantly
hatched
throughout
the
reigns
of
Elizabeth
and
James
,
by
persons
professing
the
religion
of
Rome
;
but
in
these
the
mass
of
the
Catholics
had
no
share
.
<EOS>
And
even
in
the
seasons
of
the
bitterest
persecution
,
when
every
fresh
act
of
treason
,
perpetrated
by
some
lawless
and
disaffected
individual
,
was
visited
with
additional
rigour
on
their
heads,—when
the
scaffold
reeked
with
their
blood
,
and
the
stake
smoked
with
their
ashes,—when
their
quarters
were
blackening
on
the
gates
and
market
-
crosses
of
every
city
in
the
realm,—when
their
hearths
were
invaded
,
their
religion
proscribed
,
and
the
very
name
of
Papist
had
become
a
by
-
word,—even
<EOS>
in
those
terrible
seasons
,
as
in
the
season
under
consideration
,
they
remained
constant
in
their
fidelity
to
the
crown
.
<EOS>
From
the
troubled
elements
at
work
,
some
fierce
and
turbulent
spirits
were
sure
to
arise,—some
gloomy
fanatics
who
,
having
brooded
over
their
wrongs
,
real
or
imaginary
,
till
they
had
lost
all
scruples
of
conscience
,
hesitated
at
no
means
of
procuring
redress
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
be
unjust
to
hold
up
such
persons
as
representatives
of
the
whole
body
of
Catholics
.
<EOS>
Among
the
conspirators
themselves
there
were
redeeming
shades
.
<EOS>
All
were
not
actuated
by
the
same
atrocious
motives
.
<EOS>
Mixed
feelings
induced
Catesby
to
adopt
the
measure
.
<EOS>
Not
so
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
had
already
been
leagued
with
the
design
.
<EOS>
One
idea
alone
ruled
him
.
<EOS>
A
soldier
of
fortune
,
but
a
stern
religious
enthusiast
,
he
supposed
himself
chosen
by
Heaven
for
the
redemption
of
his
Church
,
and
cared
not
what
happened
to
himself
,
provided
he
accomplished
his
(
as
he
conceived
)
holy
design
.
<EOS>
In
considering
the
causes
which
produced
the
conspiracy
about
to
be
related
,
and
in
separating
the
disaffected
party
of
the
Papists
from
the
temperate
,
due
weight
must
be
given
to
the
influence
of
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
Of
the
Romish
clergy
there
were
two
classes
—
the
secular
priests
,
and
the
Jesuits
and
missionaries
.
<EOS>
While
the
former
,
like
the
more
moderate
of
the
laity
,
would
have
been
well
-
contented
with
toleration
for
their
religion
,
the
latter
breathed
nothing
but
revenge
,
and
desired
the
utter
subversion
of
the
existing
government,—temporal
as
well
as
ecclesiastical
.
<EOS>
Men
,
for
the
most
part
,
of
high
intellectual
powers
,
of
untiring
energy
,
and
unconquerable
fortitude
,
they
were
enabled
by
their
zeal
and
ability
to
make
many
proselytes
.
<EOS>
By
their
means
,
secret
correspondence
was
carried
on
with
the
different
courts
of
Europe
;
and
they
were
not
without
hope
that
,
taking
advantage
of
some
favourable
crisis
,
they
should
yet
restore
their
church
to
its
former
supremacy
.
<EOS>
To
these
persons,—who
held
as
a
maxim
,
"
Qui
religionem
Catholicam
deserit
regnandi
jus
omne
amisit,"—Catesby
<EOS>
and
his
associates
proved
ready
and
devoted
agents
.
<EOS>
Through
their
instrumentality
,
they
hoped
to
accomplish
the
great
work
of
their
restoration
.
<EOS>
To
Father
Garnet
,
the
provincial
of
the
English
Jesuits
,
of
whom
it
will
be
necessary
to
speak
more
fully
hereafter
,
the
plot
had
been
revealed
by
Catesby
under
the
seal
of
confession
;
and
,
though
it
subsequently
became
a
question
whether
he
was
justified
in
withholding
a
secret
of
such
importance
to
the
state
,
it
is
sufficient
for
the
present
purpose
to
say
that
he
did
withhold
it
.
<EOS>
For
the
treasonable
practices
of
the
Jesuits
and
their
faction
some
palliation
may
perhaps
be
found
in
the
unrelenting
persecution
to
which
they
were
subjected
;
but
if
any
excuse
can
be
admitted
for
them
,
what
opinion
must
be
formed
of
the
conduct
of
their
temperate
brethren
?
<EOS>
Surely
,
while
the
one
is
condemned
,
admiration
may
be
mingled
with
the
sympathy
which
must
be
felt
for
the
unmerited
sufferings
of
the
other!From
the
foregoing
statement
,
it
will
be
readily
inferred
that
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
a
devout
Catholic
,
and
a
man
of
large
possessions
,
though
somewhat
reduced
by
the
heavy
fines
imposed
upon
him
as
a
recusant
,
must
have
appeared
an
object
of
importance
to
the
conspirators
;
nor
will
it
be
wondered
at
,
that
every
means
were
used
to
gain
him
to
their
cause
.
<EOS>
Acting
,
however
,
upon
the
principles
that
swayed
the
well
-
disposed
of
his
party
,
the
knight
resisted
all
these
overtures
,
and
refused
to
take
any
share
in
proceedings
from
which
his
conscience
and
loyalty
alike
revolted
.
<EOS>
Baffled
,
but
not
defeated
,
Catesby
returned
to
the
charge
on
a
new
point
of
assault
.
<EOS>
Himself
a
widower
(
or
supposed
to
be
so
)
,
he
solicited
the
hand
of
the
lovely
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
Sir
William
's
only
child
,
and
the
sole
heiress
of
his
possessions
.
<EOS>
But
his
suit
in
this
quarter
was
,
also
,
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
The
knight
rejected
the
proposal
,
alleging
that
his
daughter
had
no
inclination
to
any
alliance
,
inasmuch
as
she
entertained
serious
thoughts
of
avowing
herself
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
Thus
foiled
,
Catesby
ostensibly
relinquished
his
design
.
<EOS>
Shortly
before
the
commencement
of
this
history
,
a
pilgrimage
to
<EOS>
Saint
Winifred
's
Well
,
in
Flintshire
,
was
undertaken
by
Father
Garnet
,
the
provincial
of
the
Jesuits
before
mentioned
,
in
company
with
several
distinguished
Catholic
personages
of
both
sexes
,
and
to
this
ceremonial
Sir
William
and
his
daughter
were
urgently
bidden
.
<EOS>
The
invitation
was
declined
on
the
part
of
Viviana
,
but
accepted
by
the
knight
,
who
,
though
unwilling
to
leave
home
at
a
period
of
so
much
danger
,
or
to
commit
his
daughter
to
any
care
but
his
own
,
even
for
so
short
a
space
,
felt
it
to
be
his
duty
to
give
countenance
by
his
presence
to
the
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
departed
for
Chester
on
the
previous
day
,
as
stated
by
the
steward
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
Catesby
professed
ignorance
on
the
subject
,
and
even
affirmed
he
had
heard
to
the
contrary
,
it
may
be
doubted
whether
he
was
not
secretly
informed
of
the
circumstance
,
and
whether
his
arrival
,
at
this
particular
conjuncture
,
was
not
preconcerted
.
<EOS>
Thus
much
in
explanation
of
what
is
to
follow
.
<EOS>
The
course
of
Catesby
's
reflections
was
cut
short
by
the
return
of
the
steward
,
who
,
informing
him
that
he
had
his
mistress
's
commands
to
admit
him
,
immediately
lowered
the
drawbridge
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
Dismounting
,
and
committing
his
steed
to
one
of
the
serving
-
men
,
who
advanced
to
take
it
,
Catesby
followed
his
conductor
through
a
stone
gateway
,
and
crossing
the
garden
,
was
ushered
into
a
spacious
and
lofty
hall
,
furnished
with
a
long
massy
oak
table
,
at
the
upper
end
of
which
was
a
raised
dais
.
<EOS>
At
one
side
of
the
chamber
yawned
a
huge
arched
fire
-
place
,
garnished
with
enormous
andirons
,
on
which
smouldered
a
fire
composed
of
mixed
turf
and
wood
.
<EOS>
Above
the
chimney
-
piece
hung
a
suit
of
chain
-
armour
,
with
the
battle
-
axe
,
helmet
,
and
gauntlets
of
Sir
John
Radcliffe
,
the
first
possessor
of
Ordsall
,
who
flourished
in
the
reign
of
Edward
the
First
:
on
the
right
,
masking
the
entrance
,
stood
a
magnificent
screen
of
carved
oak
.
<EOS>
Traversing
this
hall
,
Heydocke
led
the
way
to
another
large
apartment
;
and
placing
lights
on
a
Gothic
-
shaped
table
,
offered
a
seat
to
the
new
-
comer
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
The
room
in
which
Catesby
was
left
was
termed
the
star-
chamber
—
a
name
retained
to
this
day
—
from
the
circumstance
of
its
ceiling
being
moulded
and
painted
to
resemble
the
heavenly
vault
when
studded
with
the
luminaries
of
night
.
<EOS>
It
was
terminated
by
a
deeply
-
embayed
window
filled
with
stained
glass
of
the
most
gorgeous
colours
.
<EOS>
The
walls
,
in
some
places
,
were
hung
with
arras
,
in
others
,
wainscoted
with
dark
lustrous
oak
,
embellished
with
scrolls
,
ciphers
,
and
fanciful
designs
.
<EOS>
The
mantel
-
piece
was
of
the
same
solid
material
,
curiously
carved
,
and
of
extraordinary
size
.
<EOS>
It
was
adorned
with
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
family
—
two
bends
engrailed
,
and
in
chief
a
label
of
three,—and
other
devices
and
inscriptions
.
<EOS>
The
hearth
was
considerably
raised
above
the
level
of
the
floor
,
and
there
was
a
peculiarity
in
the
construction
of
the
massive
wooden
pillars
flanking
it
,
that
attracted
the
attention
of
Catesby
,
who
rose
with
the
intention
of
examining
them
more
narrowly
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
the
lady
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Advancing
at
a
slow
and
dignified
pace
,
Viviana
Radcliffe
courteously
but
gravely
saluted
her
guest
;
and
,
without
offering
him
her
hand
,
motioned
him
to
a
chair
,
while
she
seated
herself
at
a
little
distance
.
<EOS>
Catesby
had
seen
her
twice
before
;
and
whether
the
circumstances
under
which
they
now
met
might
have
caused
some
change
in
her
demeanour
he
could
not
tell
,
but
he
thought
her
singularly
altered
.
<EOS>
A
year
ago
,
she
had
been
a
lively
,
laughing
girl
of
seventeen
,
with
a
bright
brown
skin
,
dark
flowing
tresses
,
and
eyes
as
black
and
radiant
as
those
of
a
gipsy
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
a
grave
,
collected
woman
,
infinitely
more
beautiful
,
but
wholly
changed
in
character
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
had
become
a
clear
,
transparent
white
,
and
set
off
to
great
advantage
her
large
,
luminous
eyes
,
and
jetty
brows
.
<EOS>
Her
figure
was
tall
and
majestic
;
her
features
regular
,
delicately
formed
,
and
of
the
rarest
and
proudest
class
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
was
attired
in
a
dress
of
black
wrought
velvet
,
entirely
without
ornament
except
the
rosary
at
her
girdle
,
with
a
small
ebony
crucifix
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
close
-
fitting
cap
,
likewise
of
black
velvet
,
edged
with
pearls
,
beneath
which
her
raven
tresses
were
gathered
in
such
a
manner
as
to
display
most
becomingly
the
smooth
and
snowy
expanse
of
her
forehead
.
<EOS>
The
gravity
of
her
manner
,
not
less
than
her
charms
of
person
,
seem
to
have
struck
Catesby
mute
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
on
her
in
silent
admiration
for
a
brief
space
,
utterly
forgetful
of
the
object
of
his
visit
,
and
the
part
he
intended
to
play
.
<EOS>
During
this
pause
,
she
maintained
the
most
perfect
composure
,
and
fixing
her
dark
eyes
full
upon
him
,
appeared
to
await
the
moment
when
he
might
choose
to
open
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
age
,
and
the
dissolute
and
distracted
life
he
had
led
,
Catesby
was
still
good
-
looking
enough
to
have
produced
a
favourable
impression
upon
any
woman
easily
captivated
by
manly
beauty
.
<EOS>
The
very
expression
of
his
marked
and
peculiar
physiognomy,—in
some
degree
an
index
to
his
character,—was
sufficient
to
rivet
attention
;
and
the
mysterious
interest
generally
inspired
by
his
presence
was
not
diminished
on
further
acquaintance
with
him
.
<EOS>
Though
somewhat
stern
in
their
expression
,
his
features
were
strikingly
handsome
,
cast
in
an
oval
mould
,
and
clothed
with
the
pointed
beard
and
trimmed
mustaches
invariably
met
with
in
the
portraits
of
Vandyck
.
<EOS>
His
frame
was
strongly
built
,
but
well
proportioned
,
and
seemed
capable
of
enduring
the
greatest
fatigue
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
that
of
an
ordinary
gentleman
of
the
period
,
and
consisted
of
a
doublet
of
quilted
silk
,
of
sober
colour
and
stout
texture
;
large
trunk
-
hose
swelling
out
at
the
hips
;
and
buff
boots
,
armed
with
spurs
with
immense
rowels
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
high
and
stiffly
-
starched
ruff
round
his
throat
;
and
his
apparel
was
completed
by
a
short
cloak
of
brown
cloth
,
lined
with
silk
of
a
similar
colour
.
<EOS>
His
arms
were
rapier
and
poniard
,
and
his
high
-
crowned
plumed
hat
,
of
the
peculiar
form
then
in
vogue
,
and
looped
on
the
"
leer
-
side
"
with
a
diamond
clasp
,
was
thrown
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Some
little
time
having
elapsed
,
during
which
he
made
no
effort
to
address
her
,
Viviana
broke
silence
.
<EOS>
"I
understood
you
desired
to
speak
with
me
on
a
matter
of
urgency
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
she
remarked
.
<EOS>
"I
did
so
,
"
he
replied
,
as
if
aroused
from
a
reverie
;
"
and
I
can
only
excuse
my
absence
of
mind
and
ill
manners
,
on
the
plea
that
the
contemplation
of
your
charms
has
driven
all
other
matter
out
of
my
head
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
rising
,
"
if
the
purpose
of
your
visit
be
merely
to
pay
unmerited
compliments
,
I
must
at
once
put
an
end
to
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
only
obeyed
the
impulse
of
my
heart
,
"
resumed
the
other
,
passionately
,
"
and
uttered
what
involuntarily
rose
to
my
lips
.
<EOS>
But
,
"
he
added
,
checking
himself
,
"
I
will
not
offend
you
with
my
admiration
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
read
my
letter
to
your
father
,
you
will
not
require
to
be
informed
of
the
object
of
my
visit
.
<EOS>
""I
have
not
read
it
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
returning
him
the
packet
with
the
seal
unbroken
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
give
no
opinion
on
any
matter
of
difficulty
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
desire
to
know
any
secret
with
which
my
father
might
not
desire
me
to
be
acquainted
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
we
overheard
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Catesby
,
glancing
suspiciously
at
the
fire
-
place
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
no
one
whom
you
would
care
to
overhear
us
,
"
returned
the
maiden
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
it
is
as
I
supposed
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
is
concealed
behind
that
mantel
-
piece?"Viviana
smiled
an
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
come
forth
<EOS>
,
I
pray
you
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
to
say
concerns
him
as
much
as
yourself
or
your
father
;
and
I
would
gladly
have
his
voice
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
,
my
son
<EOS>
,
"
replied
a
reverend
personage
,
clad
in
a
priestly
garb
,
stepping
from
out
one
side
of
the
mantel
-
piece
,
which
flew
suddenly
open
,
disclosing
a
recess
curiously
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
it
,
"
said
Father
Oldcorne
,
for
he
it
was
,
approaching
and
extending
his
arms
over
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Accept
my
blessing
and
my
welcome
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
<EOS>
received
the
benediction
with
bowed
head
and
bended
knee
.
"And
<EOS>
now
,
"
continued
the
priest
,
"
what
has
the
bravest
soldier
of
our
church
to
declare
to
its
lowliest
<EOS>
servant?"Catesby
then
briefly
explained
,
as
he
had
before
done
to
the
steward
,
why
he
had
taken
Manchester
in
his
route
to
North
Wales
;
and
,
after
lamenting
his
inability
to
render
any
assistance
to
the
unfortunate
priests
,
he
went
on
to
state
that
he
had
accidentally
learnt
,
from
a
few
words
<EOS>
let
fall
by
the
pursuivant
to
his
attendant
,
that
a
warrant
had
been
sent
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
for
Sir
William
Radcliffe
's
arrest
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
father
's
arrest
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
trembling
violently
.
<EOS>
"
What
—
what
is
laid
to
his
charge?""Felony
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
sternly—"felony
,
without
benefit
of
clergy
—
for
so
it
is
accounted
by
the
present
execrable
laws
of
our
land,—in
harbouring
a
Jesuit
priest
.
<EOS>
If
he
is
convicted
of
the
offence
,
his
punishment
will
be
death
—
death
on
the
gibbet
,
accompanied
by
indignities
worse
than
those
shown
to
a
common
felon
.
<EOS>
""Holy
<EOS>
Virgin
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Father
Oldcorne
,
lifting
up
his
hands
,
and
raising
his
eyes
to
heaven
.
<EOS>
"From
what
I
gathered
,
the
officers
will
visit
this
house
to
-
night
,
"
continued
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
Lady
be
praised
,
they
will
not
find
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
who
had
been
thrown
into
an
agony
of
distress
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done
in
this
frightful
emergency
,
holy
father
?
"
she
added
,
turning
to
the
priest
,
with
a
supplicating
look
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
<EOS>
only
knows
,
dear
daughter
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
appeal
for
counsel
to
one
who
is
more
able
to
afford
it
than
I
am,—Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Well
aware
of
the
crafty
devices
of
our
enemies
,
and
having
often
eluded
their
snares
himself
,
he
may
enable
you
to
escape
them
.
<EOS>
My
own
course
is
clear
.
<EOS>
I
shall
quit
this
roof
at
once
,
deeply
and
bitterly
regretting
that
by
entering
it
,
I
have
placed
those
whom
I
hold
so
dear
,
and
from
whom
I
have
experienced
so
much
kindness
,
in
such
fearful
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
no
,
father
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
"
you
shall
not
go
.
<EOS>
""Daughter
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
,
solemnly
,
"
I
have
long
borne
the
cross
of
Christ,—have
long
endured
the
stripes
,
inflicted
upon
me
by
the
adversaries
of
our
faith
,
in
patience
;
and
my
last
actions
and
last
breath
shall
testify
to
the
truth
of
our
holy
religion
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
I
could
endure
aught
on
my
own
account
,
I
can
not
consent
to
bring
misery
and
destruction
upon
others
.
<EOS>
Hinder
me
not
,
dear
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Hold
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
interposed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
The
step
you
would
take
may
bring
about
what
you
are
most
anxious
to
avoid
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
discovered
and
apprehended
in
this
neighbourhood
,
suspicion
will
still
attach
to
your
protectors
,
and
the
secret
of
your
departure
will
be
wrung
from
some
of
the
more
timid
of
the
household
.
<EOS>
Tarry
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
Let
the
pursuivant
make
his
search
.
<EOS>
I
will
engage
to
baffle
his
vigilance
.
<EOS>
""He
speaks
the
truth
,
dear
father
,
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
not
—
shall
not
depart
.
<EOS>
There
are
plenty
of
hiding
-
places
,
as
you
know
,
within
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Let
them
be
as
rigorous
as
they
may
in
their
search
,
they
will
not
discover
you
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
<EOS>
course
you
adjudge
best
for
the
security
of
others
,
I
will
pursue
,
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
,
turning
to
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Put
me
out
of
the
question
.
<EOS>
""My
opinion
has
already
been
given
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Remain
where
you
are
.
<EOS>
""But
,
if
the
officers
should
ascertain
that
my
father
is
at
Chester
,
and
pursue
him
thither
?
"
cried
Viviana
,
suddenly
struck
by
a
new
cause
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
"A
messenger
must
be
immediately
despatched
after
him
to
give
him
warning
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
be
that
messenger
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
maiden
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
would
shed
my
heart
's
best
blood
to
pleasure
you
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
may
count
upon
this
service
,
for
which
,
rest
assured
,
I
will
not
prove
ungrateful
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
may
,
"
answered
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
I
would
,
on
Father
Oldcorne
's
account
,
that
my
departure
might
be
delayed
till
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
delay
might
be
fatal
,
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
be
in
Chester
before
that
time
.
<EOS>
""Doubt
it
not
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Charged
with
your
wishes
,
the
wind
shall
scarcely
outstrip
my
speed
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
marched
irresolutely
towards
the
door
,
as
if
about
to
depart
,
when
,
just
as
he
had
reached
it
,
he
turned
sharply
round
,
and
threw
himself
at
Viviana
's
feet
.
<EOS>
"Forgive
<EOS>
me
,
Miss
Radcliffe
,
"
he
cried
,
"
if
I
once
again
,
even
at
a
critical
moment
like
the
present
,
dare
to
renew
my
suit
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
I
had
subdued
my
passion
for
you
,
but
your
presence
has
awakened
it
with
greater
violence
than
ever
.
<EOS>
""Rise
,
sir
,
I
pray
,
"
rejoined
the
maiden
,
in
an
offended
tone
.
<EOS>
"Hear
<EOS>
me
,
I
beseech
you
,
"
continued
Catesby
,
seizing
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
reject
my
suit
,
consider
well
that
in
these
perilous
seasons
,
when
no
true
Catholic
can
call
his
life
his
own
,
you
may
need
a
protector
.
<EOS>
""In
the
event
you
describe
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
answered
Viviana
,
"
I
would
at
once
fulfil
the
intention
I
have
formed
of
devoting
myself
to
Heaven
,
and
retire
to
the
convent
of
Benedictine
nuns
,
founded
by
Lady
Mary
Percy
,
at
Brussels
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
would
much
more
effectually
serve
the
cause

gravely

Redemption

nigh

the

is
at

<EOS>
England
shall
again
be
called
a
happy
realm

a
blessed
country

a
religious
people

<EOS>
Those
who
knew
the
former
glory
of
religion
shall
lift
up
their
hands
for
joy
to
see
it
returned
again
.
<EOS>
Righteousness
shall
prosper
,
and
infidelity
be
plucked
up
by
the
root
.
<EOS>
False
error
shall
vanish
like
smoke

they
which
saw
it
shall
say
where
is
it
become

<EOS>
The
daughters
of
Babylon
shall
be
cast
down
,
and
in
the
dust
lament
their
ruin
.
<EOS>
Proud
heresy
shall
strike
her
sail
,
and
groan
as
a
beast
crushed
under

<EOS>
The
memory
of

shall
perish
with

as

Powerable

will
come
as
flame

burneth
out

""Amen

ejaculated
Catesby
,
as
the
priest
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
spoken
prophetically

""I

"Do
<EOS>
you
discern
any

it

demanded
Catesby

<EOS>
"Yea

the

In

""And

"The

secret
is
safe
in

"
<EOS>
asked
Catesby
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"As
if
it
had
been
disclosed
to
me
in
private
confession

replied
Oldcorne

"Hum
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Confessions
of
as
much
consequence
to
the
state
have
ere
now
been
revealed

<EOS>
""A

<EOS>
And
the
question

been

propounded

Father
Antonio

who
,
in

putteth
it
thus:—'Supposing

Catesby

starting
.
<EOS>
"—'And
,
unless

the
priest

regarding
him
fixedly
,
"
'
the
whole
house

be
burnt

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
point
then
arises
,
"
continued
Oldcorne
,
"
whether
the
priest
may
make
use
of
the
secret
thus
obtained
for
the
good
of
the
government
,
and
the
averting
of

danger
;

,
after
fully
discussing
it
,
Father

decides
in

negative
.
<EOS>
""Enough

"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"By
whom
is
the
blow
to
be
struck
?
"
asked
Viviana
,
who
had
listened
to
the
foregoing
discourse
in
silent
wonder
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
me
,
"
answered
Catesby

<EOS>
"
It
is
for
you
to
nerve
my
arm

<EOS>
""You
speak
in

she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
understand
you
not
.
<EOS>
""Question
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
,
then
,
as
to
my
meaning
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
;
"
he
will
tell
you
that
,
allied
to
you

I
could
not
fail
in
the
enterprise
on
which
I
am
engaged

<EOS>
""It
is
the
truth

Oldcorne
asseverated
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
inquire
further
into
this
mystery

"
returned
Viviana
,
"
<EOS>
for
such
it
is
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
,
believing
what
you
both
assert
,
I
answer
,
that
willingly
as
I
would
lay
down
my
life
for
the
welfare
of
our
holy
religion
,
persuading
myself
,
as
I
do
,
that
I
have
constancy
enough
to
endure
martyrdom
for
its
sake,—I
can
not
consent
to
your
proposal

<EOS>
Nay
,
if
I
must
avouch
the
whole
truth

"
she
continued
,
blushing
deeply
,
"
my
affections
are
already
engaged

though
to
one

I
can
never

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
your
answer

"
observed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Catesby
replied
with
a
look
of
the
deepest
mortification
and
disappointment
;
and
,
bowing
coldly
to
Viviana
,
said
,
"
I
now
depart
to
obey
your

<EOS>
""Commend
<EOS>
me
in

""Neglect

Catesby

""Doubt

"After
<EOS>
receiving
a
parting
benediction
from
the
priest
,
Catesby
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
His
steed
was
speedily
brought
to
the
door
by
the
old
steward
;
and
mounting
it
,
he
crossed
the
drawbridge

which
was
immediately
raised
behind
him

hastened
on

THE
SEARCHImmediately
after
Catesby
's
departure
,
Heydocke
was
summoned
to
his
mistress
's
presence
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
with
the
priest
,
and
was
informed
that
in
all
probability
the
house
would
be
visited
that
night
by
the
messengers
of
the
Privy
Council
.
<EOS>
The
old
steward
received
the
intelligence
as
he
might
have
done
his
death
-
warrant
,
and
looked
so
bewildered
and
affrighted
,
that
Viviana
half
repented
having
acquainted
him
with
it
.
"Compose
<EOS>
yourself
,
Master
Heydocke
,
"
she
said
,
trying
to
reason
him
out
of
his
fears
;
"
the
search
may
not
take
place
.
<EOS>
And
if
it
does
,
there
is
nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
afraid
,
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
,
my
dear
young
lady
!
"
gasped
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
never
witnessed
a
midnight
search
for
a
priest
by
these
ruffianly
catchpoles
,
as
I
have
,
or
you
would
not
say
so
.
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
will
comprehend
my
uneasiness
,
and
excuse
it
.
<EOS>
The
miscreants
break
into
the
house
like
robbers
,
and
treat
its
inmates
worse
than
robbers
would
treat
them
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
regard
for
decency,—no
consideration
for
sex,—no
respect
for
persons
.
<EOS>
Not
a
chamber
is
sacred
from
them
.
<EOS>
If
a
door
is
bolted
,
they
burst
it
open
;
a
cabinet
locked
,
they
tarry
not
for
the
key
.
<EOS>
They
pull
down
the
hangings
,
thrust
their
rapier
-
points
into
the
crevices
of
the
wainscot
,
discharge
their
fire
-
arms
against
the
wall
,
and
sometimes
threaten
to
pull
down
the
house
itself
,
if
the
object
of
their
quest
be
not
delivered
to
them
.
<EOS>
Their
oaths
,
abominations
,
and
menaces
are
horrible
;
and
their
treatment
of
females
,
even
of
your
degree
,
honoured
mistress
,
too
barbarous
to
relate
.
<EOS>
Poor
Lady
Nevil
died
of
the
fright
she
got
by
such
a
visit
at
dead
of
night
to
her
residence
in
Holborn
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Vavasour
,
of
York
,
lost
her
senses
;
and
many
others
whom
I
could
mention
have
been
equal
sufferers
.
<EOS>
Nothing
to
be
alarmed
at
!
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
,
my
dear
,
dear
young
lady
,
that
you
may
never
be
fatally
convinced
to
the
contrary!""Suppose
my
apprehensions
are
as
great
as
your
own
,
Master
Heydocke
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
who
,
though
somewhat
infected
by
his
terrors
,
still
maintained
her
firmness
;
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
see
how
the
danger
is
to
be
averted
by
idle
lamentations
and
misgivings
.
<EOS>
We
must
meet
it
boldly
;
and
trust
to
Him
who
is
our
only
safeguard
in
the
hour
of
peril
,
for
protection
.
<EOS>
Do
not
alarm
the
household
,
but
let
all
retire
to
rest
as
usual
.
<EOS>
""Right
,
daughter
,
"
observed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Preparations
for
resistance
would
only
excite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
you
depend
on
the
servants
,
in
case
they
are
examined
?
"
asked
Viviana
of
the
steward
,
who
by
this
time
had
partially
recovered
his
composure
.
<EOS>
"I
think
so
,
"
returned
Heydocke
;
"
but
the
threats
of
the
officers
are
so
dreadful
,
and
their
conduct
so
violent
and
outrageous
,
that
I
can
scarcely
answer
for
myself
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
advise
your
reverence
to
remain
in
that
hiding
-
place
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
the
chimney
-
piece
;
"
they
are
sure
to
discover
it
.
<EOS>
""If
not
here
<EOS>
,
where
shall
I
conceal
myself
?
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
are
many
nooks
in
which
your
reverence
might
hide
,
"
replied
the
steward
;
"
but
the
knaves
are
so
crafty
,
and
so
well
experienced
in
their
vocation
,
that
I
dare
not
recommend
any
of
them
as
secure
.
<EOS>
I
would
advise
you
to
remain
on
the
watch
,
and
,
in
case
of
alarm
,
I
will
conduct
you
to
the
oratory
in
the
north
gallery
,
adjoining
Mistress
Viviana
's
sleeping
-
chamber
,
where
there
is
a
panel
in
the
wall
,
known
only
to
myself
and
my
master
,
opening
upon
a
secret
passage
running
many
hundred
yards
underground
,
and
communicating
with
a
small
outbuilding
on
the
other
side
of
the
moat
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
contrivance
in
this
passage
,
which
I
will
explain
to
your
reverence
if
need
be
,
which
will
cut
off
any
possibility
of
pursuit
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
place
myself
in
your
hands
,
good
Master
Heydocke
,
well
assured
of
your
fidelity
.
<EOS>
I
shall
remain
throughout
the
night
in
this
chamber
,
occupied
in
my
devotions
.
<EOS>
""You
will
suffer
me
to
pray
with
you
,
father
,
I
trust
?
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
desire
it
,
assuredly
,
dear
daughter
,
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
;
"
but
I
am
unwilling
you
should
sacrifice
your
rest
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
no
sacrifice
,
father
,
for
I
should
not
slumber
,
even
if
I
sought
my
couch
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
good
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
Keep
vigilant
watch
:
and
,
if
you
hear
the
slightest
noise
without
,
fail
not
to
give
us
warning
.
<EOS>
"The
steward
bowed
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Some
hours
elapsed
,
during
which
nothing
occurred
to
alarm
Viviana
and
her
companion
,
who
consumed
the
time
in
prayer
and
devout
conversation
;
when
,
just
at
the
stroke
of
two,—as
the
former
was
kneeling
before
her
spiritual
adviser
,
and
receiving
absolution
for
the
slight
offences
of
which
a
being
so
pure
-
minded
could
be
supposed
<EOS>
capable,—a
noise
like
the
falling
of
a
bar
of
iron
was
heard
beneath
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
priest
turned
pale
,
and
cast
a
look
of
uneasiness
at
the
maiden
,
who
said
nothing
,
but
snatching
up
the
light
,
and
motioning
him
to
remain
quiet
,
hurried
out
of
the
room
in
search
of
the
steward
.
<EOS>
He
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
In
vain
,
she
examined
all
the
lower
rooms,—in
vain
,
called
to
him
by
name
.
<EOS>
No
answer
was
returned
.
<EOS>
Greatly
terrified
,
she
was
preparing
to
retrace
her
steps
,
when
she
heard
the
sound
of
muttered
voices
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Extinguishing
her
light
,
she
advanced
to
the
door
,
which
was
left
ajar
,
and
,
taking
care
not
to
expose
herself
to
observation
,
beheld
several
armed
figures
,
some
of
whom
bore
dark
lanterns
,
while
others
surrounded
and
menaced
with
their
drawn
swords
the
unfortunate
steward
.
<EOS>
From
their
discourse
she
ascertained
that
,
having
thrown
a
plank
across
the
moat
,
and
concealed
themselves
within
the
garden
until
they
had
reconnoitred
the
premises
,
they
had
contrived
to
gain
admittance
unperceived
through
the
window
of
a
small
back
room
,
in
which
they
had
surprised
Heydocke
,
who
had
fallen
asleep
on
his
post
,
and
captured
him
.
<EOS>
One
amongst
their
number
,
who
appeared
to
act
as
leader
,
and
whom
,
from
his
garb
,
and
the
white
wand
he
carried
,
Viviana
knew
must
be
a
pursuivant
,
now
proceeded
to
interrogate
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
To
every
question
proposed
to
him
the
steward
shook
his
head
;
and
,
in
spite
of
the
threats
of
the
examinant
,
and
the
blows
of
his
followers
,
he
persisted
in
maintaining
silence
.
<EOS>
"If
we
can
not
make
this
contumacious
rascal
speak
,
we
will
find
others
more
tractable
,
"
observed
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
leave
any
corner
of
the
house
unvisited
;
nor
a
soul
within
it
unquestioned
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
here
they
come!"As
he
spoke
,
several
of
the
serving
-
men
,
with
some
of
the
female
domestics
,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
noise
,
rushed
into
the
hall
,
and
on
seeing
it
filled
with
armed
men
,
were
about
to
retreat
,
when
they
were
instantly
seized
and
detained
.
<EOS>
A
scene
of
great
confusion
now
ensued
.
<EOS>
The
women
screamed
and
cried
for
mercy
,
while
the
men
struggled
and
fought
with
their
captors
.
<EOS>
Commanding
silence
at
length
,
the
pursuivant
proclaimed
in
the
King
's
name
that
whoever
would
guide
him
to
the
hiding
-
place
of
Father
Oldcorne
,
a
Jesuit
priest
,
whom
it
was
known
,
and
could
be
proved
,
was
harboured
within
the
mansion
,
should
receive
a
free
pardon
and
reward
;
while
those
who
screened
him
,
or
connived
at
his
concealment
,
were
liable
to
fine
,
imprisonment
,
and
even
more
severe
punishment
.
<EOS>
Each
servant
was
then
questioned
separately
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
all
were
more
or
less
rudely
dealt
with
,
no
information
could
be
elicited
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Viviana
was
a
prey
to
the
most
intolerable
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
reach
Father
Oldcorne
without
crossing
the
hall
,
which
she
did
not
dare
to
attempt
,
she
gave
him
up
for
lost
;
her
sole
hope
being
that
,
on
hearing
the
cries
of
the
domestics
,
he
would
provide
for
his
own
safety
.
<EOS>
Her
anxiety
was
still
farther
increased
when
the
pursuivant
,
having
exhausted
his
patience
by
fruitless
interrogatories
,
and
satisfied
his
malice
by
frightening
two
of
the
females
into
fits
,
departed
with
a
portion
of
his
band
to
search
the
house
,
leaving
the
rest
as
a
guard
over
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
Viviana
then
felt
that
,
if
she
would
save
Father
Oldcorne
,
the
attempt
must
be
made
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
and
at
any
hazard
.
<EOS>
Watching
her
opportunity
,
when
the
troopers
were
occupied,—some
in
helping
themselves
to
such
viands
and
liquors
as
they
could
lay
hands
upon,—some
in
searching
the
persons
of
the
prisoners
for
amulets
and
relics,—while
others
,
more
humane
,
were
trying
to
revive
the
swooning
women
,
she
contrived
to
steal
unperceived
across
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Having
gained
the
passage
,
she
found
to
her
horror
that
the
pursuivant
and
his
band
were
already
within
the
star
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
They
were
sounding
the
walls
with
hammers
and
mallets
,
and
from
their
exclamations
,
she
learnt
that
they
had
discovered
the
retreat
behind
the
fire
-
place
,
and
were
about
to
break
it
open
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
him
,
"
roared
the
pursuivant
,
in
a
voice
of
triumph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
old
owl
's
roost
is
here!"Viviana
,
who
stood
at
the
door
,
drew
in
her
breath
,
expecting
that
the
next
moment
would
inform
her
that
the
priest
was
made
captive
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
this
,
she
was
delighted
to
find
,
from
the
oaths
of
rage
and
disappointment
uttered
by
the
troopers
,
that
he
had
eluded
them
.
<EOS>
"He
must
be
in
the
house
,
at
all
events
,
"
growled
the
pursuivant
;
"
nor
is
it
long
since
he
quitted
his
hiding
-
place
,
as
this
cushion
proves
.
<EOS>
We
will
not
go
away
without
him
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
let
us
proceed
to
the
upper
chambers
.
<EOS>
"Hearing
<EOS>
their
footsteps
approach
,
Viviana
darted
off
,
and
quickly
ascending
the
principal
staircase
,
entered
a
long
corridor
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
what
to
do
,
she
was
about
to
proceed
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
bar
the
door
,
when
she
felt
her
arm
grasped
by
a
man
.
<EOS>
With
difficulty
repressing
a
shriek
,
she
strove
to
disengage
herself
,
when
a
whisper
told
her
it
was
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
<EOS>
"
you
are
safe
.
<EOS>
How
—
how
did
you
escape?""I
flew
upstairs
on
hearing
the
voices
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
has
happened
to
the
steward?""He
is
a
prisoner
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
then
is
lost
,
unless
you
are
acquainted
with
the
secret
panel
he
spoke
of
in
the
oratory
,
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
father
,
I
am
wholly
ignorant
of
it
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
,
come
with
me
into
my
chamber
;
they
will
not
dare
to
invade
it
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
that
,
"
returned
the
priest
,
despairingly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
sacrilegious
villains
would
not
respect
the
sanctity
of
the
altar
itself
.
<EOS>
""They
come
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
as
lights
were
seen
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
Take
my
hand
—
this
way
,
father
.
<EOS>
"They
had
scarcely
gained
the
room
,
and
fastened
the
door
,
when
the
pursuivant
and
his
attendants
appeared
in
the
corridor
.
<EOS>
The
officer
,
it
would
seem
,
had
been
well
instructed
where
to
search
,
or
was
sufficiently
practised
in
his
duty
,
for
he
proceeded
at
once
to
several
hiding
-
places
in
the
different
chambers
which
he
visited
.
<EOS>
In
one
room
he
detected
a
secret
staircase
in
the
wall
,
which
he
mounted
,
and
discovered
a
small
chapel
built
in
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Stripping
it
of
its
altar
,
its
statue
of
the
Virgin
,
its
crucifix
,
pix
,
chalice
,
and
other
consecrated
vessels
,
he
descended
,
and
continued
his
search
.
<EOS>
Viviana
's
chamber
was
now
the
only
one
unvisited
.
<EOS>
Trying
the
door
,
and
finding
it
locked
,
he
tapped
against
it
with
his
wand
.
"Who
<EOS>
knocks
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
maiden
.
<EOS>
"A
state
-
messenger
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
I
demand
entrance
in
the
King
's
name
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
have
it
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
my
sleeping
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
""My
duty
allows
me
no
alternative
,
"
rejoined
the
pursuivant
,
harshly
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
not
admit
me
quietly
,
I
must
use
force
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
know
to
whom
you
offer
this
rudeness
?
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
daughter
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
replied
the
pursuivant
;
"
but
I
am
not
exceeding
my
authority
.
<EOS>
I
hold
a
warrant
for
your
father
's
arrest
.
<EOS>
And
,
if
he
had
not
been
from
home
,
I
should
have
carried
him
to
prison
along
with
the
Jesuit
priest
<EOS>
whom
,
I
suspect
,
is
concealed
within
your
chamber
.
<EOS>
Open
the
door
,
I
command
you
;
and
do
not
hinder
me
in
the
execution
of
my
duty
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
no
answer
was
returned
to
the
application
,
the
pursuivant
commanded
his
men
to
burst
open
the
door
;
and
the
order
was
promptly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
was
empty
.
<EOS>
On
searching
it
,
however
,
the
pursuivant
found
a
door
concealed
by
the
hangings
of
the
bed
.
<EOS>
It
was
bolted
on
the
other
side
,
but
speedily
yielded
to
his
efforts
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
it
,
he
entered
upon
a
narrow
gallery
,
at
the
extremity
of
which
his
progress
was
stopped
by
another
door
,
likewise
fastened
on
the
further
side
.
<EOS>
On
bursting
it
open
,
he
entered
a
small
oratory
,
wainscoted
with
oak
,
and
lighted
by
an
oriel
window
filled
with
stained
glass
,
through
which
the
newly
-
risen
moon
was
pouring
its
full
radiance
,
and
discovered
the
object
of
his
search
.
<EOS>
"Father
<EOS>
Oldcorne
,
I
arrest
you
as
a
Jesuit
and
a
traitor
,
"
shouted
the
pursuivant
,
in
a
voice
of
exultation
.
<EOS>
"
Seize
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
calling
to
his
men
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
not
take
him
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
clinging
despairingly
to
the
priest
,
who
offered
no
resistance
,
but
clasped
a
crucifix
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"Leave
<EOS>
go
your
hold
,
young
mistress
,
"
rejoined
the
pursuivant
,
grasping
Oldcorne
by
the
collar
of
his
vestment
,
and
dragging
him
along
;
"
and
rest
thankful
that
I
make
you
not
,
also
,
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
;
but
spare
him!—in
mercy
spare
him
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
solicit
mercy
from
one
who
knows
it
not
,
daughter
,
"
observed
the
priest
.
"
<EOS>
Lead
on
,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
attend
you
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
destination
is
the
New
Fleet
,
father
,
"
retorted
the
pursuivant
,
in
a
tone
of
bitter
raillery
;
"
unless
you
prefer
the
cell
in
Radcliffe
Hall
lately
vacated
by
your
saintly
predecessor
,
Father
Woodroofe
.
<EOS>
""Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
may
spare
your
voice
,
fair
lady
,
"
sneered
the
pursuivant
.
"
<EOS>
No
help
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Your
servants
are
all
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
words
were
scarcely
uttered
,
when
a
sliding
panel
in
the
wall
flew
open
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
,
followed
by
Humphrey
Chetham
,
and
another
personage
,
sprang
through
the
aperture
,
and
presented
a
petronel
at
the
head
of
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
V.
—
<EOS>
CHAT
MOSSThe
pursuivant
was
taken
so
completely
unawares
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
Guy
Fawkes
and
his
companions
,
that
he
made
no
attempt
at
resistance
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
his
attendants
less
confounded
.
<EOS>
Before
they
recovered
from
their
surprise
,
Humphrey
Chetham
seized
Viviana
in
his
arms
,
and
darting
through
the
panel
,
called
to
the
priest
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
was
about
to
comply
,
when
one
of
the
soldiers
,
grasping
the
surcingle
at
his
waist
,
dragged
him
forcibly
backwards
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
however
,
he
was
set
free
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
,
felling
the
man
to
the
ground
,
and
interposing
himself
between
the
priest
and
the
other
soldier
,
enabled
the
former
to
make
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
planted
himself
in
front
of
the
panel
,
and
with
a
petronel
in
each
hand
,
menaced
his
opponents
.
<EOS>
"Fly
<EOS>
for
your
lives
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
to
the
others
.
"
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
I
have
taken
greater
odds
,
and
in
a
worse
cause
,
and
have
not
been
worsted
.
<EOS>
Heed
me
not
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
I
will
defend
the
passage
till
you
are
beyond
reach
of
danger
.
<EOS>
Fly!—fly!""After
them

"
<EOS>
vociferated
the
pursuivant
,
stamping
with
rage
and
vexation
;
"
after
them
instantly
!
<EOS>
Hew
down
that
bold
traitor

<EOS>
Show
him
no
quarter

<EOS>
His
life
is
forfeit

king

<EOS>
Slay
him
as
you
would
a
dog!"But
the
men
,
having
no
fire
-
arms
,
were
so
much
intimidated
by
the
fierce
looks
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
the
deadly
weapons
he
pointed
at
their
heads
,
that
they
hesitated
to
obey
their
leader
's
injunctions
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
hear
what
I
say
to
you

cravens

roared
the
pursuivant

<EOS>
Cut
him
down
without
mercy

<EOS>
""They
dare
not
move
a
footstep

rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
a
decisive
tone
.
<EOS>
Illustration"Recreants
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
pursuivant
,
foaming
with
rage
,
"
is
my
prey
to
be
snatched
from
me
at
the
very
moment
I
have
secured
it
,
through
your
cowardice

<EOS>
Obey
me
instantly

,
as
Heaven
shall
judge
me

will
denounce
you
to
my
Lord
Derby

the
Commissioners

aiders

abettors
in
Father
Oldcorne

escape!—and
<EOS>
you
well
know
what
your
punishment
will
be

so

What!—are
<EOS>
you
afraid
of
one
man?""Our
pikes

observed
the
foremost
soldier

sullenly
.
<EOS>
"They
are
not
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
;
"
and
you
will
do
well
not
to
compel
me
to
prove
the
truth
of
your
assertion
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
Master
Pursuivant
,
"
he
continued
,
with
a
look
so
stern
that
the
other
quailed
before
it
,
"
unwilling
as
I
am
to
shed
blood
,
I
shall
hold
your
life
,
if
I
am
compelled
to
take
it
,
but
just
retribution
for
the
fate
you
have
brought
upon
the
unfortunate
Elizabeth
Orton
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
"
exclaimed
the
pursuivant
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
recognised
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
soldier
in
the
Spanish
garb
who
saved
that
false
prophetess
from
drowning
.
<EOS>
""I
saved
her
only
for
a
more
lingering
death
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
retorted
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
"
I
found
her
dead
body
when
I
visited
her
cell
on
my
way
hither
,
and
gave
orders
to
have
it
interred
without
coffin
or
shroud
in
that
part
of
the
burial
-
ground
of
the
Collegiate
Church
in
Manchester
reserved
for
common
felons

<EOS>
""I
know
not
what

my

rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
strongly
tempted
to
give
you
a
grave
beside
her

<EOS>
""I
will
put
your
daring
to
the
proof

<EOS>
cried
the
pursuivant
,
snatching
a
pike
from
one
of
his
followers

and
brandishing
it
over
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
Throw
down
your
arms

you
die!""Back

exclaimed
Guy
Fawkes
,
presenting
a
petronel
at
him

I
lodge
a
bullet

<EOS>
""Be
advised

certain
destruction

good
Master
Pursuivant

said
the
foremost
soldier

plucking
his
mantle

<EOS>
"
I
see
by

bloodthirsty
looks

the

""Then

springing
through

closing
it
after
him
.
<EOS>
"Confusion
!
"
exclaimed
the
pursuivant
;
"
but
he
shall
not
escape
.
<EOS>
Break
open
the
panel
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
order
was
promptly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
The
men
battered
the
stout
oak
board
,
which
was
of
great
thickness
,
with
their
pikes
,
but
it
resisted
every
effort
,
nor
was
it
until
the
arrival
of
a
fresh
band
of
soldiers
with
lights
,
mallets
,
chisels
,
and
other
implements
suitable
to
the
purpose
,
that
it
could
be
forced
open
.
<EOS>
This
accomplished
,
the
pursuivant
,
commanding
his
attendants
to
follow
him
,
dashed
through
the
aperture
.
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
singly
along
the
narrow
passage
,
the
roof
became
so
low
that
they
were
compelled
to
adopt
a
stooping
posture
.
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
hurried
on
until
their
further
progress
was
stopped
by
a
massive
stone
door
,
which
appeared
to
descend
from
above
by
some
hidden
contrivance
,
no
trace
of
bolt
or
other
fastening
being
discernible
.
<EOS>
The
flag
fitted
closely
in
channels
in
the
walls
,
and
had
all
the
appearance
of
solid
masonry
.
<EOS>
After
examining
this
obstacle
for
a
moment
,
the
pursuivant
was
convinced
that
any
attempt
to
move
it
would
be
impracticable
,
and
muttering
a
deep
execration
,
he
gave
the
word
to
return
.
<EOS>
"From
the
course
it
appears
to
take
,
"
he
observed
,
"
this
passage
must
communicate
with
the
garden,—perhaps
with
the
further
side
of
the
moat
.
<EOS>
We
may
yet
secure
them
,
if
we
use
despatch
.
<EOS>
"To
return
to
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
point
where
the
stone
door
was
situated
,
which
he
discovered
by
the
channels
in
the
wall
above
-
mentioned
,
Guy
Fawkes
searched
for
an
iron
ring
,
and
,
having
found
it
,
drew
it
towards
him
,
and
the
ponderous
flag
slowly
dropped
into
its
place
.
<EOS>
He
then
groped
his
way
cautiously
along
in
the
dark
,
until
his
foot
encountered
the
top
of
a
ladder
,
down
which
he
crept
,
and
landed
on
the
floor
of
a
damp
deep
vault
.
<EOS>
Having
taken
the
precaution
to
remove
the
ladder
,
he
hastened
onwards
for
about
fifty
yards
,
when
he
came
to
a
steep
flight
of
stone
steps
,
distinguishable
by
a
feeble
glimmer
of
light
from
above
,
and
mounting
them
,
emerged
through
an
open
trap
-
door
into
a
small
building
situated
at
the
western
side
of
the
moat
,
where
,
to
his
surprise
and
disappointment
,
he
found
the
other
fugitives
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
comes
it
you
are
here
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
in
a
reproachful
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
kept
the
wolves
at
bay
thus
long
,
to
enable
you
to
make
good
your
retreat
.
<EOS>
""Miss
<EOS>
Radcliffe
is
too
weak
to
move
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
;
"
and
I
could
not
persuade
Father
Oldcorne
to
leave
her
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
care
not
what
becomes
of
me
,
"
said
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
my
painful
race
is
run
the
better
.
<EOS>
But
I
cannot
—
will
not
abandon
my
dear
charge
thus
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
not
of
me
,
father
,
I
implore
you
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
who
had
sunk
overpowered
with
terror
and
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
better
soon
.
<EOS>
Master
Chetham
,
I
am
assured
,
will
remain
with
me
till
our
enemies
have
departed
,
and
I
will
then
return
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
""Command
me
as
you
please
,
Miss
Radcliffe
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
but
to
express
a
wish
to
insure
its
fulfilment
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
that
you
had
suffered
Mr.
Catesby
to
tarry
with
us
till
the
morning
,
as
he
himself
proposed
,
dear
daughter
,
"
observed
the
priest
,
turning
to
Viviana
.
"Has
<EOS>
Catesby
been
here
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Guy
Fawkes
,
with
a
look
of
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
He
came
to
warn
us
that
the
hall
would
be
this
night
searched
by
the
officers
of
state
;
and
he
also
brought
word
that
a
warrant
had
been
issued
by
the
Privy
Council
for
the
arrest
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
""Where
is
he
now
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Fawkes
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
the
way
to
Chester
<EOS>
,
whither
he
departed
in
all
haste
,
at
Viviana
's
urgent
request
,
to
apprise
her
father
of
his
danger
,
"
rejoined
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"This
is
strange
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Catesby
here
,
and
I
not
know
it!""He
had
a
secret
motive
for
his
visit
,
my
son
,
"
whispered
Oldcorne
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
conclude
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
<EOS>
Radcliffe
,
"
murmured
Humphrey
Chetham
,
in
low
and
tender
accents
,
"
something
tells
me
that
this
moment
will
decide
my
future
fate
.
<EOS>
Emboldened
by
the
mysterious
manner
in
which
we
have
been
brought
together
,
and
you
,
as
it
were
,
have
been
thrown
upon
my
protection
,
I
venture
to
declare
the
passion
I
have
long
indulged
for
you;—a
passion
which
,
though
deep
and
fervent
as
ever
agitated
human
bosom
,
has
hitherto
,
from
the
difference
of
our
rank
,
and
yet
more
from
the
difference
of
our
religious
opinions
,
been
without
hope
.
<EOS>
What
has
just
occurred,—added
to
the
peril
in
which
your
worthy
father
stands
,
and
the
difficulties
in
which
you
yourself
will
necessarily
be
involved,—makes
<EOS>
me
cast
aside
all
misgiving
,
and
perhaps
with
too
much
presumption
,
but
with
a
confident
belief
that
the
sincerity
of
my
love
renders
me
not
wholly
undeserving
of
your
regard
,
earnestly
solicit
you
to
give
me
a
husband
's
right
to
watch
over
and
defend
you
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
was
silent
.
<EOS>
But
even
by
the
imperfect
light
the
young
merchant
could
discern
that
her
cheek
was
covered
with
blushes
.
<EOS>
"Your
answer
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"You
must
take
it
from
my
lips
,
Master
Chetham
,
"
interposed
the
priest
;
"
Viviana
Radcliffe
never
can
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""Be
pleased
to
let
her
speak
for
herself
,
reverend
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
young
merchant
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
represent
her
father
,
and
have
acquainted
you
with
his
determination
,
"
rejoined
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
Appeal
to
her
,
and
she
will
confirm
my
words
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
,
is
this
true
?
"
asked
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
Does
your
father
object
to
your
union
with
me?"Viviana
answered
by
a
deep
sigh
,
and
gently
withdrew
her
hand
from
the
young
merchant
's
grasp
.
<EOS>
"Then
there
is
no
hope
for
me
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
nor
for
me
—
of
earthly
affection
.
<EOS>
I
am
already
dead
to
the
world
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"I
am
about
to
vow
myself
to
Heaven
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
!
"
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
,
"
reflect!—oh
!
<EOS>
reflect
,
before
you
take
this
fatal
—
this
irrevocable
step
.
<EOS>
""Rise
,
sir
,
"
interposed
the
priest
,
sternly
;
"
you
plead
in
vain
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Radcliffe
will
never
we
d
his
daughter
to
a
heretic
.
<EOS>
In
his
name
I
command
you
to
desist
from
further
solicitation
.
<EOS>
""I
obey
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
lose
time
here
,
"
observed
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
had
been
lost
for
a
moment
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
undertake
to
provide
for
your
safety
,
father
.
<EOS>
But
,
what
must
be
done
with
Viviana
?
<EOS>
She
can
not
be
left
here
.
<EOS>
And
her
return
to
the
hall
would
be
attended
with
danger
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
return
till
the
miscreants
have
quitted
it
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Their
<EOS>
departure
is
uncertain
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
When
they
are
baulked
of
their
prey
they
sometimes
haunt
a
dwelling
for
weeks
.
<EOS>
""What
will
become
of
me
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"It
were
vain
,
I
fear
,
to
entreat
you
to
accept
an
asylum
with
my
father
at
Clayton
Hall
,
or
at
my
own
residence
at
Crumpsall
,
"
said
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Your
offer
is
most
kind
,
sir
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
,
"
and
is
duly
appreciated
.
<EOS>
But
Viviana
will
see
the
propriety
—
on
every
account
—
of
declining
it
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
<EOS>
;
I
do
,
"
she
acquiesced
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
entrust
yourself
to
my
protection
?
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Willingly
,
"
replied
the
priest
,
answering
for
her
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
find
some
place
of
refuge
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Viviana
,
"
where
your
father
can
join
us
,
and
where
we
can
remain
concealed
till
this
storm
has
blown
over
.
<EOS>
""I
know
many
such
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
"
both
in
this
county
and
in
Yorkshire
,
and
will
guide
you
to
one
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
horses
are
at
your
service
,
"
said
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
tied
beneath
the
trees
in
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
My
servant
shall
bring
them
to
the
door
,
"
and
,
turning
to
his
attendant
,
he
gave
him
directions
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
riding
hither
an
hour
before
midnight
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Viviana
,
"
to
offer
you
assistance
,
having
accidentally
heard
the
pursuivant
mention
his
meditated
visit
to
Ordsall
Hall
,
to
one
of
his
followers
,
when
,
as
I
approached
the
gates
,
this
person
,
"
pointing
to
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
crossed
my
path
,
and
,
seizing
the
bridle
of
my
steed
,
demanded
whether
I
was
a
friend
to
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
I
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
desired
to
know
the
motive
of
his
inquiry
.
<EOS>
He
then
told
me
that
the
house
was
invested
by
a
numerous
band
of
armed
men
,
who
had
crossed
the
moat
by
means
of
a
plank
,
and
were
at
that
moment
concealed
within
the
garden
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
,
besides
filling
me
with
alarm
,
disconcerted
all
my
plans
,
as
I
hoped
to
have
been
beforehand
with
them
—
their
inquisitorial
searches
being
generally
made
at
a
late
hour
,
when
all
the
inmates
of
a
house
intended
to
be
surprised
are
certain
to
have
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
bitterly
reproaching
myself
for
my
dilatoriness
,
and
considering
what
course
it
would
be
best
to
pursue
,
my
servant
,
Martin
Heydocke
,
son
to
your
father
's
old
steward
,
who
had
ridden
up
at
the
stranger
's
approach
,
informed
me
that
he
was
acquainted
with
a
secret
passage
communicating
beneath
the
moat
with
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
I
dismounted
;
and
fastening
my
horse
to
a
tree
,
ordered
him
to
lead
me
to
it
without
an
instant
's
delay
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
,
who
gave
his
name
as
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
professed
himself
a
stanch
Catholic
,
and
a
friend
of
Father
Oldcorne
,
begged
permission
to
join
us
,
in
a
tone
so
earnest
,
that
I
at
once
acceded
to
his
request
.
<EOS>
We
then
proceeded
to
this
building
,
and
after
some
search
discovered
the
trap
-
door
.
<EOS>
Much
time
was
lost
,
owing
to
our
being
unprovided
with
lights
,
in
the
subterranean
passage
;
and
it
was
more
than
two
hours
before
we
could
find
the
ring
connected
with
the
stone
door
,
the
mystery
of
which
Martin
explained
to
us
.
<EOS>
This
delay
we
feared
would
render
our
scheme
abortive
,
when
,
just
as
we
reached
the
panel
,
we
heard
your
shrieks
.
<EOS>
The
spring
was
touched
,
and
—
you
know
the
rest
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
shall
never
forget
it
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
gratitude
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
the
tramp
of
horses
was
heard
at
the
door
;
and
the
next
moment
it
was
thrown
open
by
the
younger
Heydocke
,
who
,
with
a
look
,
and
in
a
voice
of
the
utmost
terror
,
exclaimed
,
"
They
are
coming!—they
<EOS>
are
coming!""The
pursuivant
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
him
alone
,
but
the
whole
gang
,
"
rejoined
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
Some
of
them
are
lowering
the
drawbridge
,
while
others
are
crossing
the
plank
.
<EOS>
Several
are
on
horseback
,
and
I
think
I
discern
the
pursuivant
amongst
the
number
.
<EOS>
They
have
seen
me
,
and
are
hurrying
in
this
direction
.
<EOS>
"As
he
spoke
,
a
loud
shout
corroborated
his
statement
.
<EOS>
"We
are
lost
!
"
exclaimed
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
despair
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
will
not
abandon
its
faithful
servants
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
will
deliver
us
out
of
the
hands
of
these
Amalekites
.
<EOS>
""To
horse
,
then
,
if
you
would
indeed
avoid
them
,
"
urged
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
The
shouts
grow
louder
.
<EOS>
Your
enemies
are
fast
approaching
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
are
you
willing
to
fly
with
us?""I
will
do
anything
rather
than
be
left
to
those
horrible
men
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
then
raised
her
in
his
arms
,
and
sprang
with
his
lovely
burthen
upon
the
nearest
charger
.
<EOS>
His
example
was
quickly
followed
by
Humphrey
Chetham
,
who
,
vaulting
on
the
other
horse
,
assisted
the
priest
to
mount
behind
him
.
<EOS>
While
this
took
place
,
Martin
Heydocke
darted
into
the
shed
,
and
instantly
bolted
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
,
almost
as
bright
as
day
,
and
the
movements
of
each
party
were
fully
revealed
to
the
other
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
perceived
at
a
glance
that
they
were
surrounded
;
and
,
though
he
had
no
fears
for
himself
,
he
was
full
of
apprehension
for
the
safety
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
debating
with
himself
as
to
the
course
it
would
be
best
to
pursue
,
Humphrey
Chetham
shouted
to
him
to
turn
to
the
left
,
and
started
off
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Grasping
his
fair
charge
,
whom
he
had
placed
before
him
on
the
saddle
,
firmly
with
his
left
arm
,
and
wrapping
her
in
his
ample
cloak
,
Guy
Fawkes
drew
his
sword
,
and
striking
spurs
into
his
steed
,
followed
in
the
same
track
.
<EOS>
The
little
fabric
which
had
afforded
them
temporary
shelter
,
it
has
already
been
mentioned
,
was
situated
on
the
west
of
the
hall
,
at
a
short
distance
from
the
moat
,
and
was
screened
from
observation
by
a
small
shrubbery
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
the
fugitives
emerge
from
this
cover
,
than
loud
outcries
were
raised
by
their
antagonists
,
and
every
effort
was
made
to
intercept
them
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
galloping
towards
them
on
a
light
but
swift
courser
,
taken
from
Sir
William
Radcliffe
's
stables
,
came
the
pursuivant
,
attended
by
half
-
a
-
dozen
troopers
,
who
had
accommodated
themselves
with
horses
in
the
same
manner
as
their
leader
.
<EOS>
Between
them
and
the
road
leading
to
Manchester
,
were
stationed
several
armed
men
on
foot
.
<EOS>
At
the
rear
,
voices
proclaimed
that
others
were
in
full
pursuit
;
while
in
front
,
a
fourth
detachment
menaced
them
with
their
pikes
.
<EOS>
Thus
beset
on
all
sides
,
it
seemed
scarcely
possible
to
escape
.
<EOS>
Nothing
daunted
,
however
,
by
the
threats
and
vociferations
with
which
they
were
received
,
the
two
horsemen
boldly
charged
this
party
.
<EOS>
The
encounter
was
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
warded
off
a
blow
,
which
,
if
it
had
taken
effect
,
must
have
robbed
Viviana
of
life
,
and
struck
down
the
fellow
who
aimed
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
his
career
was
checked
by
another
assailant
,
who
,
catching
his
bridle
with
the
hook
of
his
pike
,
commanded
him
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
replied
by
cleaving
the
man
's
staff
asunder
,
and
,
having
thus
disembarrassed
himself
,
was
about
to
pursue
his
course
,
when
he
perceived
that
Humphrey
Chetham
was
in
imminent
danger
from
a
couple
of
soldiers
who
had
stopped
him
,
and
were
trying
to
unhorse
his
companion
.
<EOS>
Riding
up
to
them
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
by
a
vigorous
and
well
-
directed
attack
,
speedily
drove
them
off
;
and
the
fugitives
,
being
now
unimpeded
,
were
enabled
to
continue
their
career
.
<EOS>
The
foregoing
occurrences
were
witnessed
by
the
pursuivant
with
the
utmost
rage
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
Pouring
forth
a
torrent
of
threats
and
imprecations
,
he
swore
he
would
never
rest
till
he
had
secured
them
,
and
urging
his
courser
to
its
utmost
speed
,
commanded
his
men
to
give
chase
.
<EOS>
Skirting
a
sluice
,
communicating
between
the
Irwell
and
the
moat
,
Humphrey
Chetham
,
who
,
as
better
acquainted
with
the
country
than
his
companions
,
took
the
lead
,
proceeded
along
its
edge
for
about
a
hundred
yards
,
when
he
suddenly
struck
across
a
narrow
bridge
covered
with
sod
,
and
entered
the
open
fields
.
<EOS>
Hitherto
Viviana
had
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
Though
fully
aware
of
the
risk
she
had
run
,
she
gave
no
sign
of
alarm
—
not
even
when
the
blow
was
aimed
against
her
life
;
and
it
was
only
on
conceiving
the
danger
in
some
degree
past
,
that
she
ventured
to
express
her
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"You
have
displayed
so
much
courage
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
answer
to
her
speech
,
"
that
it
would
be
unpardonable
to
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
Our
foes
are
too
near
us
,
and
too
well
mounted
,
to
make
it
by
any
means
certain
we
shall
escape
them,—unless
by
stratagem
.
<EOS>
""They
are
within
a
hundred
yards
of
us
,
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
,
glancing
fearfully
backwards
.
<EOS>
"
They
have
possessed
themselves
of
your
father
's
fleetest
horses
;
and
,
if
I
mistake
not
,
the
rascally
pursuivant
has
secured
your
favourite
barb
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
gentle
Zayda
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
Then
indeed
we
are
lost
.
<EOS>
She
has
not
her
match
for
speed
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
she
bring
her
rider
to
us
alone
,
she
will
do
us
good
service
,
"
observed
Guy
Fawkes
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
The
same
notion
,
almost
at
the
same
moment
,
occurred
to
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
Having
witnessed
the
prowess
displayed
by
Guy
Fawkes
in
his
recent
attack
on
the
soldiers
,
he
felt
no
disposition
to
encounter
so
formidable
an
opponent
single
-
handed
;
and
finding
that
the
high
-
mettled
barb
on
which
he
was
mounted
,
by
its
superior
speed
and
fiery
temper
,
would
inevitably
place
him
in
such
a
dilemma
,
he
prudently
resolved
to
halt
,
and
exchange
it
for
a
more
manageable
steed
.
<EOS>
This
delay
was
of
great
service
to
the
fugitives
,
and
enabled
them
to
get
considerably
ahead
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
gained
a
narrow
lane
,
and
,
tracking
it
,
speedily
reached
the
rocky
banks
of
the
Irwell
.
<EOS>
Galloping
along
a
foot
-
path
that
followed
the
serpentine
course
of
the
stream
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
arrived
at
a
spot
marked
by
a
bed
of
osiers
,
where
Humphrey
Chetham
informed
them
there
was
a
ford
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
plunged
into
the
river
,
and
while
stemming
the
current
,
which
here
ran
with
great
swiftness
,
and
rose
up
above
the
saddles
,
the
neighing
of
a
steed
was
heard
from
the
bank
they
had
quitted
.
<EOS>
Turning
at
the
sound
,
Viviana
beheld
her
favourite
courser
on
the
summit
of
a
high
rock
.
<EOS>
The
soldier
to
whom
Zayda
was
intrusted
had
speedily
,
as
the
pursuivant
foresaw
,
distanced
his
companions
,
and
chose
this
elevated
position
to
take
sure
aim
at
Guy
Fawkes
,
against
whom
he
was
now
levelling
a
caliver
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
bullet
struck
against
his
brigandine
,
but
without
doing
him
any
injury
.
<EOS>
The
soldier
,
however
,
did
not
escape
so
lightly
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
the
discharge
,
the
fiery
barb
leaped
from
the
precipice
into
the
river
,
and
throwing
her
rider
,
who
was
borne
off
by
the
rapid
stream
,
swam
towards
the
opposite
bank
,
which
she
reached
just
as
the
others
were
landing
.
<EOS>
At
the
sound
of
her
mistress
's
voice
she
stood
still
,
and
allowed
Humphrey
Chetham
to
lay
hold
of
her
bridle
;
and
Viviana
declaring
she
was
able
to
mount
her
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
felt
that
such
an
arrangement
was
most
likely
to
conduce
to
her
safety
,
and
who
was
,
moreover
,
inclined
to
view
the
occurrence
as
a
providential
interference
in
their
behalf
,
immediately
assisted
her
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
Before
this
transfer
could
be
effected
,
the
pursuivant
and
his
attendants
had
begun
to
ford
the
stream
.
<EOS>
The
former
had
witnessed
the
accident
that
had
befallen
the
soldier
from
a
short
distance
;
and
,
while
he
affected
to
deplore
it
,
internally
congratulated
himself
on
his
prudence
and
foresight
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
by
no
means
so
well
satisfied
when
he
saw
how
it
served
to
benefit
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
"That
unlucky
beast
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Some
fiend
must
have
prompted
me
to
bring
her
out
of
the
stable
.
<EOS>
Would
she
had
drowned
herself
instead
of
poor
Dickon
Duckesbury
,
whom
she
hath
sent
to
feed
the
fishes
!
<EOS>
With
her
aid
,
Miss
Radcliffe
will
doubtless
escape
.
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
If
I
secure
Father
Oldcorne
,
and
that
black
-
visaged
trooper
in
the
Spanish
garb
,
who
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
is
a
secret
intelligencer
of
the
pope
,
if
not
of
the
devil
,
I
shall
be
well
contented
.
<EOS>
I
'll
hang
them
both
on
a
gibbet
higher
than
Haman's
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
muttering
other
threats
to
the
same
effect
,
he
picked
his
way
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
Long
before
he
reached
it
,
the
fugitives
had
disappeared
;
but
on
climbing
the
bank
,
he
beheld
them
galloping
swiftly
across
a
well
-
wooded
district
steeped
in
moonlight
,
and
spread
out
before
his
view
,
and
inflamed
by
the
sight
he
shouted
to
his
attendants
,
and
once
more
started
in
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Cheered
by
the
fortunate
incident
above
related
,
which
,
in
presenting
her
with
her
own
steed
in
a
manner
so
surprising
and
unexpected
,
seemed
almost
to
give
her
assurance
of
deliverance
,
Viviana
,
inspirited
by
the
exercise
,
felt
her
strength
and
spirits
rapidly
revive
.
<EOS>
At
her
side
rode
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
ever
and
anon
cast
an
anxious
look
behind
,
to
ascertain
the
distance
of
their
pursuers
,
but
suffered
no
exclamation
to
escape
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
throughout
the
whole
affair
,
he
maintained
the
reserve
belonging
to
his
sombre
and
taciturn
character
,
and
neither
questioned
Humphrey
Chetham
as
to
where
he
was
leading
them
,
nor
proposed
any
deviation
from
the
route
he
had
apparently
chosen
.
<EOS>
To
such
remarks
as
were
addressed
to
him
,
Fawkes
answered
in
monosyllables
;
and
it
was
only
when
occasion
required
,
that
he
volunteered
any
observation
or
advice
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
to
surrender
himself
to
chance
.
<EOS>
And
perhaps
,
if
his
bosom
could
have
been
examined
,
it
would
have
been
found
that
he
considered
himself
a
mere
puppet
in
the
hands
of
destiny
.
<EOS>
In
other
and
calmer
seasons
,
he
might
have
dwelt
with
rapture
on
the
beautiful
and
varied
country
through
which
they
were
speeding
,
and
which
from
every
knoll
they
mounted
,
every
slope
they
descended
,
every
glade
they
threaded
,
intricacy
pierced
,
or
tangled
dell
tracked
,
presented
new
and
increasing
attractions
.
<EOS>
This
charming
district
,
since
formed
into
a
park
by
the
Traffords
,
from
whom
it
derives
its
present
designation
,
was
at
this
time,—though
part
of
the
domain
of
that
ancient
family,—wholly
unenclosed
.
<EOS>
Old
Trafford
Hall
lies
(
for
it
is
still
in
existence
,
)
more
than
a
mile
nearer
to
Manchester
,
a
little
to
the
east
of
Ordsall
Hall
;
but
the
modern
residence
of
the
family
is
situated
in
the
midst
of
the
lovely
region
through
which
the
fugitives
were
riding
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
charms
of
the
scene
,
heightened
by
the
gentle
medium
through
which
they
were
viewed
,
produced
little
effect
upon
the
iron
nature
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
they
were
not
without
influence
on
his
companions
,
especially
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Soothed
by
the
stillness
of
all
around
her
,
she
almost
forgot
her
danger
;
and
surrendering
herself
to
the
dreamy
enjoyment
generally
experienced
in
contemplating
such
a
scene
at
such
an
hour
,
suffered
her
gaze
to
wander
over
the
fair
woody
landscape
before
her
,
till
it
was
lost
in
the
distant
moonlit
wolds
.
<EOS>
From
the
train
of
thought
naturally
awakened
by
this
spectacle
,
she
was
roused
by
the
shouts
of
the
pursuers
;
and
,
glancing
timorously
behind
her
,
beheld
them
hurrying
swiftly
along
the
valley
they
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
From
the
rapidity
with
which
they
were
advancing
,
it
was
evident
they
were
gaining
upon
them
,
and
she
was
about
to
urge
her
courser
to
greater
speed
,
when
Humphrey
Chetham
laid
his
hand
upon
the
rein
to
check
her
.
<EOS>
"Reserve
<EOS>
yourself
<EOS>
till
we
gain
the
brow
of
this
hill
,
"
he
remarked
;
"
and
then
put
Zayda
to
her
mettle
.
<EOS>
We
are
not
far
from
our
destination
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
it?""I
will
show
it
to
you
presently
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
summit
of
the
high
ground
,
which
they
had
been
for
some
time
gradually
ascending
,
the
young
merchant
pointed
out
a
vast
boggy
tract
,
about
two
miles
off
,
in
the
vale
beneath
them
.
<EOS>
"That
is
our
destination
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
I
not
hold
it
impossible
<EOS>
you
could
trifle
with
me
at
such
a
time
as
this
,
I
should
say
you
were
jesting
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
place
you
indicate
,
unless
I
mistake
you
,
is
Chat
Moss
,
the
largest
and
most
dangerous
marsh
in
Lancashire
.
<EOS>
""You
do
not
mistake
me
,
neither
am
<EOS>
I
jesting
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
,
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
Chat
Moss
is
the
mark
at
which
I
aim
.
<EOS>
""If
we
are
to
cross
it
,
we
shall
need
a
Will
-
o'-the
-
wisp
to
guide
us
,
and
some
friendly
elf
to
make
firm
the
ground
beneath
our
steeds
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
in
a
slightly
-
sarcastic
tone
.
<EOS>
"Trust
<EOS>
to
me
<EOS>
and
you
shall
traverse
it
in
safety
,
"
resumed
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"I
would
sooner
trust
myself
to
the
pursuivant
and
his
band
,
than
venture
upon
its
treacherous
surface
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
is
this
,
young
sir
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
from
heedlessness
or
rashness
that
you
are
about
to
expose
us
to
this
new
danger?—which
,
if
Viviana
judges
correctly
,
and
my
own
experience
of
such
places
inclines
me
to
think
she
does
so,—is
greater
than
that
which
now
besets
us
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
there
is
any
danger
I
shall
be
the
first
to
encounter
it
,
for
I
propose
to
act
as
your
guide
,
"
returned
Humphrey
Chetham
,
in
an
offended
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
the
treacherous
character
of
the
marsh
constitutes
our
safety
.
<EOS>
I
am
acquainted
with
a
narrow
path
across
it
,
from
which
the
deviation
of
a
foot
will
bring
certain
death
.
<EOS>
If
our
pursuers
attempt
to
follow
us
their
destruction
is
inevitable
.
<EOS>
Viviana
may
rest
assured
<EOS>
I
would
not
needlessly
expose
so
dear
a
life
as
hers
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
our
best
chance
of
safety
.
<EOS>
""Humphrey
<EOS>
Chetham
is
in
the
right
,
"
observed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
heard
of
the
path
he
describes
;
and
if
he
can
guide
us
along
it
,
we
shall
effectually
baffle
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
""I
cry
you
mercy
,
sir
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
apprehend
your
meaning
.
<EOS>
But
I
now
thankfully
resign
myself
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
""Forward
,
then
,
"
cried
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
And
they
dashed
swiftly
down
the
declivity
.
<EOS>
Chat
Moss
,
towards
which
they
were
hastening
,
though
now
drained
,
in
part
cultivated
,
and
traversed
by
the
busiest
and
most
-
frequented
railroad
in
England
,
or
the
world
,
was
,
within
the
recollection
of
many
of
the
youngest
of
the
present
generation
,
a
dreary
and
almost
impassable
waste
.
<EOS>
Surveyed
from
the
heights
of
Dunham
,
whence
the
writer
has
often
gazed
upon
it
,
envying
the
plover
her
wing
to
skim
over
its
broad
expanse
<EOS>
,
it
presented
with
its
black
boggy
soil
,
striped
like
a
motley
garment
,
with
patches
of
grey
,
tawny
,
and
dunnish
red
,
a
singular
and
mysterious
appearance
.
<EOS>
Conjecture
fixes
this
morass
as
the
site
of
a
vast
forest
,
whose
immemorial
and
Druid
-
haunted
groves
were
burnt
by
the
Roman
invaders
;
and
seeks
to
account
for
its
present
condition
by
supposing
that
the
charred
trees
—
still
frequently
found
within
its
depths
—
being
left
where
the
conflagration
had
placed
them
,
had
choked
up
its
brooks
and
springs
,
and
so
reduced
it
to
a
general
swamp
.
<EOS>
Drayton
,
however
,
in
the
following
lines
from
the
Faerie
Land
,
places
its
origin
as
far
back
as
the
Deluge:———Great
Chat
Moss
at
my
fall
<EOS>
Lies
fall
of
turf
and
marl
,
<EOS>
her
unctuous
mineral
;
And
blocks
as
black
as
pitch
,
<EOS>
with
boring
augers
found
,
There
at
the
General
Flood
supposed
to
be
drown'd
.
<EOS>
But
the
former
hypothesis
appears
the
more
probable
.
<EOS>
A
curious
description
of
Chat
Moss
,
as
it
appeared
at
the
time
of
this
history
,
is
furnished
by
Camden
,
who
terms
it
,
"
a
swampy
tract
of
great
extent
,
a
considerable
part
of
which
was
carried
off
in
the
last
age
by
swollen
rivers
with
great
danger
,
whereby
the
rivers
were
infected
,
and
great
quantities
of
fish
died
.
<EOS>
Instead
thereof
is
now
a
valley
watered
by
a
small
stream
;
and
many
trees
were
discovered
thrown
down
,
and
lying
flat
,
so
that
one
may
suppose
when
the
ground
lay
neglected
,
and
the
waste
water
of
brooks
was
not
drained
off
into
the
open
valleys
,
or
their
courses
stopped
by
neglect
or
desolation
,
all
the
lower
grounds
were
turned
into
swamps
,
(
which
we
call
mosses
,
)
or
into
pools
.
<EOS>
If
this
was
the
case
,
no
wonder
<EOS>
so
many
trees
are
found
covered
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
buried
in
such
places
all
over
England
,
but
especially
here
.
<EOS>
For
the
roots
being
loosened
by
too
excessive
wet
,
they
must
necessarily
fall
down
and
sink
in
so
soft
a
soil
.
<EOS>
The
people
hereabouts
search
for
them
with
poles
and
spits
,
and
after
marking
the
place
,
dig
them
up
and
use
them
for
firing
,
for
they
are
like
torches
,
equally
fit
to
burn
and
to
give
light
,
which
is
probably
owing
to
the
bituminous
earth
that
surrounds
them
,
whence
the
common
people
suppose
them
firs
,
though
Cæsar
denies
that
there
were
such
trees
in
Britain
.
<EOS>
"But
,
though
vast
masses
of
the
bog
had
been
carried
off
by
the
Irwell
and
the
Mersey
,
as
related
by
Camden
,
the
general
appearance
of
the
waste,—with
<EOS>
the
exception
of
the
valley
and
the
small
stream,—was
much
the
same
as
it
continued
to
our
own
time
.
<EOS>
Its
surface
was
more
broken
and
irregular
,
and
black
gaping
chasms
and
pits
filled
with
water
and
slime
as
dark
-
coloured
as
the
turf
whence
it
flowed
,
pointed
out
the
spots
where
the
swollen
and
heaving
swamp
had
burst
its
bondage
.
<EOS>
Narrow
paths
,
known
only
to
the
poor
turf
-
cutters
and
other
labourers
who
dwelt
upon
its
borders
,
and
gathered
fuel
with
poles
and
spits
in
the
manner
above
described
,
intersected
it
at
various
points
.
<EOS>
But
as
they
led
in
many
cases
to
dangerous
and
deep
gulfs
,
to
dismal
quagmires
and
fathomless
pits
;
and
,
moreover
,
as
the
slightest
departure
from
the
proper
track
would
have
whelmed
the
traveller
in
an
oozy
bed
,
from
which
,
as
from
a
quicksand
,
he
would
have
vainly
striven
to
extricate
himself,—it
was
never
crossed
without
a
guide
,
except
by
those
familiar
with
its
perilous
courses
.
<EOS>
One
painful
circumstance
connected
with
the
history
of
Chat
Moss
remains
to
be
recorded
—
namely
,
that
the
attempt
made
to
cultivate
it
by
the
great
historian
Roscoe,—an
attempt
since
carried
out
,
as
has
already
been
shown
,
with
complete
success,—ended
in
a
result
ruinous
to
the
fortunes
of
that
highly
-
gifted
person
,
who
,
up
to
the
period
of
this
luckless
undertaking
,
was
as
prosperous
as
he
was
meritorious
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
fugitives
had
approached
the
confines
of
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
An
accident
,
however
,
had
just
occurred
,
which
nearly
proved
fatal
to
Viviana
,
and
,
owing
to
the
delay
it
occasioned
,
brought
their
pursuers
into
dangerous
proximity
with
them
.
<EOS>
In
fording
the
Irwell
,
which
,
from
its
devious
course
,
they
were
again
compelled
to
cross
,
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
below
Barton
,
her
horse
missed
its
footing
,
and
precipitated
her
into
the
rapid
current
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
she
would
have
been
borne
away
,
if
Guy
Fawkes
had
not
flung
himself
into
the
water
,
and
seized
her
before
she
sank
.
<EOS>
Her
affrighted
steed
,
having
got
out
of
its
depth
,
began
to
swim
off
,
and
it
required
the
utmost
exertion
on
the
part
of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
embarrassed
as
he
was
by
the
priest
,
to
secure
it
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
all
was
set
to
rights
,
and
Viviana
was
once
more
placed
on
the
saddle
,
without
having
sustained
further
inconvenience
than
was
occasioned
by
her
dripping
apparel
.
<EOS>
But
those
few
minutes
,
as
has
been
just
stated
,
sufficed
to
bring
the
pursuivant
and
his
men
close
upon
them
;
and
as
they
scrambled
up
the
opposite
bank
,
the
plunging
and
shouting
behind
them
told
that
the
latter
had
entered
the
stream
.
<EOS>
"Yonder
<EOS>
is
Baysnape
,
"
exclaimed
Humphrey
Chetham
,
calling
Viviana
's
attention
to
a
ridge
of
high
ground
on
the
borders
of
the
waste
.
<EOS>
"
Below
it
lies
the
path
by
which
I
propose
to
enter
the
moss
.
<EOS>
We
shall
speedily
be
out
of
the
reach
of
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
marsh
at
least
will
hide
us
,
"
answered
Viviana
,
with
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
terrible
alternative
.
<EOS>
""Fear
<EOS>
nothing
,
dear
daughter
,
"
observed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
saints
,
who
have
thus
marvellously
protected
us
,
will
continue
to
watch
over
us
to
the
end
,
and
will
make
the
path
over
yon
perilous
waste
as
safe
as
the
ground
on
which
we
tread
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
like
not
the
appearance
of
the
sky
,
"
observed
Guy
Fawkes
,
looking
uneasily
upwards
.
<EOS>
"
Before
we
reach
the
spot
you
have
pointed
out
,
the
moon
will
be
obscured
.
<EOS>
Will
it
be
safe
to
traverse
the
moss
in
the
dark?""It
<EOS>
is
our
only
chance
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
,
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
that
his
answer
might
not
reach
Viviana
's
ears
;
"
and
after
all
,
the
darkness
may
be
serviceable
.
<EOS>
Our
pursuers
are
so
near
,
that
if
it
were
less
gloomy
,
they
might
hit
upon
the
right
track
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
a
risk
to
us
to
proceed
,
but
certain
destruction
to
those
who
follow
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
make
what
haste
we
can
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
is
precious
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
dreary
and
fast
darkening
waste
had
now
opened
upon
them
in
all
its
horrors
.
<EOS>
Far
as
the
gaze
could
reach
appeared
an
immense
expanse
,
flat
almost
as
the
surface
of
the
ocean
,
and
unmarked
,
so
far
as
could
be
discerned
in
that
doubtful
light
,
by
any
trace
of
human
footstep
or
habitation
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
stern
and
sombre
prospect
,
and
calculated
to
inspire
terror
in
the
stoutest
bosom
.
<EOS>
What
effect
it
produced
on
Viviana
may
be
easily
conjectured
.
<EOS>
But
her
nature
was
brave
and
enduring
,
and
,
though
she
trembled
so
violently
as
scarcely
to
be
able
to
keep
her
seat
,
she
gave
no
utterance
to
her
fears
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
skirting
that
part
of
the
morass
since
denominated
,
from
the
unfortunate
speculation
previously
alluded
to
,
"
Roscoe
's
Improvements
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
tract
was
the
worst
and
most
dangerous
portion
of
the
whole
moss
.
<EOS>
Soft
,
slabby
,
and
unsubstantial
,
its
treacherous
beds
scarcely
offered
secure
footing
to
the
heron
that
alighted
on
them
.
<EOS>
The
ground
shook
beneath
the
fugitives
as
they
hurried
past
the
edge
of
the
groaning
and
quivering
marsh
.
<EOS>
The
plover
,
scared
from
its
nest
,
uttered
its
peculiar
and
plaintive
cry
;
the
bittern
shrieked
;
other
night
-
fowl
poured
forth
their
doleful
notes
;
and
the
bull
-
frog
added
its
deep
croak
to
the
ominous
concert
.
<EOS>
Behind
them
came
the
thundering
tramp
and
loud
shouts
of
their
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
had
judged
correctly
.
<EOS>
Before
they
reached
Baysnape
the
moon
had
withdrawn
behind
a
rack
of
clouds
,
and
it
had
become
profoundly
dark
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
this
point
,
Humphrey
Chetham
called
to
them
to
turn
off
to
the
right
.
<EOS>
"Follow
<EOS>
singly
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
do
not
swerve
a
hair
's
breadth
from
the
path
.
<EOS>
The
slightest
deviation
will
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
Do
you
,
sir
,
"
he
added
to
the
priest
,
"
mount
behind
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
let
Viviana
come
next
after
me
.
<EOS>
If
I
should
miss
my
way
,
do
not
stir
for
your
life
.
<EOS>
"The
transfer
effected
,
the
fugitives
turned
off
to
the
right
,
and
proceeded
at
a
cautious
pace
along
a
narrow
and
shaking
path
.
<EOS>
The
ground
trembled
so
much
beneath
them
,
and
their
horses
'
feet
sank
so
deeply
in
the
plashy
bog
,
that
Viviana
demanded
,
in
a
tone
of
some
uneasiness
,
if
he
was
sure
he
had
taken
the
right
<EOS>
course?"If
I
had
not
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
"
we
should
ere
this
have
found
our
way
to
the
bottom
of
the
morass
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
a
floundering
plunge
,
accompanied
by
a
horrible
and
quickly
-
stifled
cry
,
told
that
one
of
their
pursuers
had
perished
in
endeavouring
to
follow
them
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
poor
wretch
is
gone
to
his
account
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
in
a
tone
of
commiseration
.
"
<EOS>
Have
a
care!—have
a
care
,
lest
you
share
the
same
fate
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
can
save
you
<EOS>
,
I
care
not
what
becomes
of
me
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
Since
I
can
never
hope
to
possess
you
,
life
has
become
valueless
in
my
eyes
.
<EOS>
""Quicken
<EOS>
your
pace
,
"
shouted
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
"
Our
pursuers
have
discovered
the
track
,
and
are
making
towards
us
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
them
do
so
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
They
can
do
us
no
farther
injury
.
<EOS>
""That
is
false
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
voice
of
a
soldier
from
behind
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
words
were
uttered
,
a
shot
was
fired
,
which
,
though
aimed
against
Chetham
,
took
effect
upon
his
steed
.
<EOS>
The
animal
staggered
,
and
his
rider
had
only
time
to
slide
from
his
back
when
he
reeled
off
the
path
,
and
was
ingulfed
in
the
marsh
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
plunge
of
the
steed
,
the
man
fancied
he
had
hit
his
mark
,
and
hallooed
in
an
exulting
voice
to
his
companions
.
<EOS>
But
his
triumph
was
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
A
ball
from
the
petronel
of
Guy
Fawkes
pierced
his
brain
,
and
dropping
from
his
saddle
,
he
sank
,
together
with
his
horse
,
which
he
dragged
along
with
him
into
the
quagmire
.
<EOS>
"Waste
<EOS>
no
more
shot
,
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
;
"
the
swamp
will
fight
our
battles
for
us
.
<EOS>
Though
I
grieve
for
the
loss
of
my
horse
,
I
may
be
better
able
to
guide
you
on
foot
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
seized
Viviana
's
bridle
,
and
drew
her
steed
along
at
a
quick
pace
,
but
with
the
greatest
caution
.
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
,
a
light
like
that
of
a
lantern
was
seen
to
rise
from
the
earth
,
and
approach
them
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Viviana
:
"
some
one
has
heard
us
,
and
is
hastening
to
our
assistance
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
The
light
you
behold
is
an
ignis
fatuus
.
<EOS>
Were
you
to
trust
yourself
to
its
delusive
gleam
,
it
would
lead
you
to
the
most
dangerous
parts
of
the
moss
.
<EOS>
"And
,
as
if
to
exhibit
its
real
character
,
the
little
flame
,
which
hitherto
had
burnt
as
brightly
and
steadily
as
a
wax
-
candle
,
suddenly
appeared
to
dilate
,
and
assuming
a
purple
tinge
,
emitted
a
shower
of
sparks
,
and
then
flitted
rapidly
over
the
plain
.
<EOS>
"Woe
<EOS>
to
him
that
follows
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"It
has
a
strange
unearthly
look
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
crossing
herself
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
much
difficulty
in
persuading
myself
<EOS>
it
is
not
the
work
of
some
malignant
sprite
.
<EOS>
""It
is
only
an
exhalation
of
the
marsh
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
see
!
<EOS>
others
are
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"Their
<EOS>
approach
,
indeed
,
seemed
to
have
disturbed
all
the
weird
children
of
the
waste
.
<EOS>
Lights
were
seen
trooping
towards
them
in
every
direction
;
sometimes
stopping
,
sometimes
rising
in
the
air
,
now
contracting
,
now
expanding
,
and
when
within
a
few
yards
of
the
travellers
,
retreating
with
inconceivable
swiftness
.
<EOS>
"It
is
a
marvellous
and
incomprehensible
spectacle
,
"
remarked
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
common
folk
hereabouts
affirm
that
these
Jack
-
o'-lanterns
,
as
they
term
them
,
always
appear
in
greater
numbers
when
some
direful
catastrophe
is
about
to
take
place
,
"
rejoined
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
<EOS>
avert
it
from
us
,
"
ejaculated
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"It
is
an
idle
superstition
,
"
returned
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
now
keep
silence
,
"
he
continued
,
lowering
his
voice
,
and
stopping
near
the
charred
stump
of
a
tree
,
left
,
it
would
seem
,
as
a
mark
.
<EOS>
"
The
road
turns
here
;
and
,
unless
our
pursuers
know
it
,
we
shall
now
quit
them
for
ever
.
<EOS>
We
must
not
let
a
sound
betray
the
course
we
are
about
to
take
.
<EOS>
"Having
turned
this
dangerous
corner
in
safety
,
and
conducted
his
companions
as
noiselessly
as
possible
for
a
few
yards
along
the
cross
path
,
which
being
much
narrower
was
consequently
more
perilous
than
the
first
,
Humphrey
Chetham
stood
still
,
and
,
imposing
silence
upon
the
others
,
listened
to
the
approach
of
their
pursuers
.
<EOS>
His
prediction
was
speedily
and
terribly
verified
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
movement
in
advance
,
but
unable
to
discover
the
course
taken
by
the
fugitives
,
the
unfortunate
soldiers
,
fearful
of
losing
their
prey
,
quickened
their
pace
,
in
the
expectation
of
instantly
overtaking
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
fatally
undeceived
.
<EOS>
Four
only
of
their
number
,
besides
their
leader
,
remained,—two
<EOS>
having
perished
in
the
manner
heretofore
described
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
,
disregarding
the
caution
of
his
comrade
,
laughingly
urged
his
horse
into
a
gallop
,
and
,
on
passing
the
mark
,
sunk
as
if
by
magic
,
and
before
he
could
utter
a
single
warning
cry
,
into
the
depths
of
the
morass
.
<EOS>
His
disappearance
was
so
instantaneous
,
that
the
next
in
order
,
though
he
heard
the
sullen
plunge
,
was
unable
to
draw
in
the
rein
,
and
was
likewise
ingulfed
.
<EOS>
A
third
followed
;
and
a
fourth
,
in
his
efforts
to
avoid
their
fate
,
backed
his
steed
over
the
slippery
edge
of
the
path
.
<EOS>
Only
one
now
remained
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
pursuivant
,
who
,
with
the
prudence
that
characterized
all
his
proceedings
,
had
followed
in
the
rear
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
dreadfully
frightened
,
<EOS>
that
,
adding
his
shrieks
to
those
of
his
attendants
,
he
shouted
to
the
fugitives
,
imploring
assistance
in
the
most
piteous
terms
,
and
promising
never
again
to
molest
them
,
if
they
would
guide
him
to
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
But
his
cries
were
wholly
unheeded
;
and
he
perhaps
endured
in
those
few
minutes
of
agony
as
much
suffering
as
he
had
inflicted
on
the
numerous
victims
of
his
barbarity
.
<EOS>
It
was
indeed
an
appalling
moment
.
<EOS>
Three
of
the
wretched
men
had
not
yet
sunk
,
but
were
floundering
about
in
the
swamp
,
and
shrieking
for
help
.
<EOS>
The
horses
,
as
much
terrified
as
their
riders
,
added
their
piercing
cries
to
the
half
-
suffocated
yells
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
if
to
make
the
scene
more
ghastly
,
myriads
of
dancing
lights
flitted
towards
them
,
and
throwing
an
unearthly
glimmer
over
this
part
of
the
morass
,
fully
revealed
their
struggling
figures
.
<EOS>
Moved
by
compassion
for
the
poor
wretches
,
Viviana
implored
Humphrey
Chetham
to
assist
them
,
and
,
finding
him
immovable
,
she
appealed
to
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"They
are
beyond
all
human
aid
,
"
the
latter
replied
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
have
mercy
on
their
souls
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
priest
"
Pray
for
them
,
dear
daughter
.
<EOS>
Pray
heartily
,
as
I
am
about
to
do
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
recited
in
an
audible
voice
the
Romish
formula
of
supplication
for
those
in
extremis
.
<EOS>
Averting
her
gaze
from
the
spectacle
,
Viviana
joined
fervently
in
the
prayer
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
two
of
the
strugglers
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
third
,
having
freed
himself
from
his
horse
,
contrived
for
some
moments
,
during
which
he
uttered
the
most
frightful
cries
,
to
keep
his
head
above
the
swamp
.
<EOS>
His
efforts
were
tremendous
,
but
unavailing
,
and
served
only
to
accelerate
his
fate
.
<EOS>
Making
a
last
desperate
plunge
towards
the
bank
where
the
fugitives
were
standing
,
he
sank
above
the
chin
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
his
face
,
shown
by
the
ghastly
glimmer
of
the
fen
-
fires
,
as
he
was
gradually
swallowed
up
,
was
horrible
.
<EOS>
"Requiem
<EOS>
æternam
dona
eis
,
Domine
,
"
exclaimed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
is
over
,
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
,
taking
the
bridle
of
Viviana
's
steed
,
and
leading
her
onwards
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
free
from
our
pursuers
.
<EOS>
""There
is
one
left
<EOS>
,
"
she
rejoined
,
casting
a
look
backwards
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
pursuivant
,
"
returned
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
within
shot
,
"
he
added
,
drawing
his
petronel
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
<EOS>
no
—
no!—in
pity
spare
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Too
many
lives
have
been
sacrificed
already
.
<EOS>
""He
is
the
cause
of
all
the
mischief
,
"
answered
Guy
Fawkes
,
unwillingly
replacing
the
petronel
in
his
belt
,
"
and
may
live
to
injure
you
and
your
father
.
<EOS>
""I
will
hope
not
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
;
"
but
,
spare
him!—oh
,
<EOS>
spare
<EOS>
him!""Be
it
as
you
please
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
marsh
,
I
trust
,
will
not
be
so
merciful
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
they
slowly
resumed
their
progress
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
their
departure
,
the
pursuivant
renewed
his
cries
in
a
more
piteous
tone
than
ever
;
but
,
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
Viviana
,
nothing
could
induce
her
companions
to
lend
him
assistance
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
they
proceeded
in
silence
,
and
without
accident
.
<EOS>
As
they
advanced
,
the
difficulties
of
the
path
increased
,
and
it
was
fortunate
that
the
moon
,
emerging
from
the
clouds
in
which
,
up
to
this
moment
,
she
had
been
shrouded
,
enabled
them
to
steer
their
course
in
safety
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
after
a
tedious
and
toilsome
march
for
nearly
half
a
mile
,
the
footing
became
more
secure
,
the
road
widened
,
and
they
were
able
to
quicken
their
pace
.
<EOS>
Another
half
mile
landed
them
upon
the
western
bank
of
the
morass
.
<EOS>
Viviana
's
first
impulse
was
to
give
thanks
to
Heaven
for
their
deliverance
,
nor
did
she
omit
in
her
prayer
a
supplication
for
the
unfortunate
beings
who
had
perished
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
point
now
known
as
Rawson
Nook
,
they
entered
a
lane
,
and
proceeded
towards
Astley
Green
,
where
perceiving
a
cluster
of
thatched
cottages
among
the
trees
,
they
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
first
,
and
speedily
obtained
admittance
from
its
inmates
,
a
turf
-
cutter
and
his
wife
.
<EOS>
The
man
conveyed
their
steeds
to
a
neighbouring
barn
,
while
the
good
dame
offered
Viviana
such
accommodation
and
refreshment
as
her
humble
dwelling
afforded
.
<EOS>
Here
they
tarried
till
the
following
evening
,
as
much
to
recruit
Miss
Radcliffe
's
strength
,
as
for
security
.
<EOS>
At
the
young
merchant
's
request
,
the
turf
-
cutter
went
in
the
course
of
the
day
to
see
what
had
become
of
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
He
was
nowhere
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
But
he
accidentally
learned
from
another
hind
,
who
followed
the
same
occupation
as
himself
,
that
a
person
answering
to
the
officer
's
description
had
been
seen
to
emerge
from
the
moss
near
Baysnape
at
daybreak
,
and
take
the
road
towards
Manchester
.
<EOS>
Of
the
unfortunate
soldiers
nothing
but
a
steel
cap
and
a
pike
,
which
the
man
brought
away
with
him
,
could
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
After
much
debate
,
it
was
decided
that
their
safest
plan
would
be
to
proceed
to
Manchester
,
where
Humphrey
Chetham
undertook
to
procure
them
safe
lodgings
at
the
Seven
Stars,—an
excellent
hostel
,
kept
by
a
worthy
widow
,
who
,
he
affirmed
,
would
do
anything
to
serve
him
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
set
out
at
nightfall,—Viviana
taking
her
place
before
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
relinquishing
Zayda
to
the
young
merchant
and
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Shaping
their
course
through
Worsley
,
by
Monton
Green
and
Pendleton
,
they
arrived
in
about
an
hour
within
sight
of
the
town
,
which
then,—not
<EOS>
a
tithe
of
its
present
size
,
and
unpolluted
by
the
smoky
atmosphere
in
which
it
is
now
constantly
enveloped,—was
not
without
some
pretensions
to
a
picturesque
appearance
.
<EOS>
Crossing
Salford
Bridge
,
they
mounted
Smithy
-
Bank
,
as
it
was
then
termed
,
and
proceeding
along
Cateaton
-
street
and
Hanging
Ditch
,
struck
into
Whithing
(
now
Withy
)
Grove
,
at
the
right
of
which
,
just
where
a
few
houses
were
beginning
to
straggle
up
Shude
Hill
,
stood
,
and
still
stands
,
<EOS>
the
comfortable
hostel
of
the
Seven
Stars
.
<EOS>
Here
they
stopped
,
and
were
warmly
welcomed
by
its
buxom
mistress
,
Dame
Sutcliffe
.
<EOS>
Muffled
in
Guy
Fawkes
's
cloak
,
the
priest
gained
the
chamber
to
which
he
was
ushered
unobserved
.
<EOS>
And
Dame
Sutcliffe
,
though
her
Protestant
notions
were
a
little
scandalized
at
her
dwelling
being
made
the
sanctuary
of
a
Popish
priest
,
promised
,
at
the
instance
of
Master
Chetham
,
whom
she
knew
to
be
no
favourer
of
idolatry
in
a
general
way
,
to
be
answerable
for
his
safety
.

THE
DISINTERMENTHaving
seen
every
attention
shown
to
Viviana
by
the
hostess,—who
,
as
soon
as
she
discovered
that
she
had
the
daughter
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
of
Ordsall
,
under
her
roof
,
bestirred
herself
in
right
earnest
for
her
accommodation,—Humphrey
Chetham
,
notwithstanding
the
lateness
of
the
hour,—it
<EOS>
was
past
<EOS>
midnight,—expressed
his
determination
to
walk
to
his
residence
at
Crumpsall
,
to
put
an
end
to
any
apprehension
which
might
be
entertained
by
the
household
at
his
prolonged
absence
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
set
forth
;
and
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
seemed
to
be
meditating
some
project
which
he
was
unwilling
to
disclose
to
the
others
,
quitted
the
hostel
with
him
,
bidding
the
chamberlain
sit
up
for
him
,
as
he
should
speedily
return
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
when
he
inquired
the
nearest
way
to
the
Collegiate
Church
,
and
was
answered
that
they
were
then
proceeding
towards
it
,
and
in
a
few
moments
should
arrive
at
its
walls
.
<EOS>
He
next
asked
the
young
merchant
whether
he
could
inform
him
which
part
of
the
churchyard
was
allotted
to
criminals
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
,
somewhat
surprised
by
the
question
,
replied
,
"
At
the
north
-
west
,
near
the
charnel
,
"
adding
,
"
I
shall
pass
within
a
short
distance
of
the
spot
,
and
will
point
it
out
to
you
.
"Entering
<EOS>
Fennel
Street
,
at
the
end
of
which
stood
an
ancient
cross
,
they
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
moon
was
shining
brightly
,
and
silvered
the
massive
square
tower
of
the
fane
,
the
battlements
,
pinnacles
,
buttresses
,
and
noble
eastern
window
,
with
its
gorgeous
tracery
.
<EOS>
While
Guy
Fawkes
paused
for
a
moment
to
contemplate
this
reverend
and
beautiful
structure
,
two
venerable
personages
,
having
long
snowy
beards
,
and
wrapped
in
flowing
mantles
edged
with
sable
fur
,
passed
the
end
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
carried
a
lantern
,
though
it
was
wholly
needless
,
as
it
was
bright
as
day
;
and
as
they
glided
stealthily
along
,
there
was
something
so
mysterious
in
their
manner
,
that
it
greatly
excited
the
curiosity
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
inquired
from
his
companion
if
he
knew
who
they
were
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
foremost
is
the
warden
of
Manchester
,
the
famous
Doctor
Dee
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
"
divine
,
mathematician
,
astrologer,—and
<EOS>
if
report
speaks
truly
,
conjuror
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
that
Doctor
Dee
?
"
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
:
"
and
the
other
in
the
Polish
cap
is
the
no
-
less
celebrated
Edward
Kelley
,
the
doctor
's
assistant
,
or
,
as
he
is
ordinarily
termed
,
<EOS>
his
seer
.
<EOS>
""They
have
entered
the
churchyard
,
"
remarked
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
follow
them
.
<EOS>
""I
would
not
advise
you
to
do
so
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
Strange
tales
are
told
of
them
.
<EOS>
You
may
witness
that
it
is
not
safe
to
look
upon
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
caution
,
however
,
was
unheeded
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
had
already
disappeared
,
and
the
young
merchant
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
proceeded
on
his
way
towards
Hunt
's
Bank
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
churchyard
,
Guy
Fawkes
perceived
the
warden
and
his
companion
creeping
stealthily
beneath
the
shadow
of
a
wall
in
the
direction
of
a
low
fabric
,
which
appeared
to
be
a
bone
-
house
,
or
charnel
,
situated
at
the
north
-
western
extremity
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
Before
this
building
grew
a
black
and
stunted
yew
-
tree
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
it
,
they
paused
,
and
looked
round
to
see
whether
they
were
observed
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
,
however
,
notice
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
had
concealed
himself
behind
a
buttress
.
<EOS>
Kelley
then
unlocked
the
door
of
the
charnel
,
and
brought
out
a
pickaxe
and
mattock
.
<EOS>
Having
divested
himself
of
his
cloak
,
he
proceeded
to
shovel
out
the
mould
from
a
new
-
made
grave
at
a
little
distance
from
the
building
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
stood
by
,
and
held
the
lantern
for
his
assistant
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
watch
their
proceedings
,
Guy
Fawkes
crept
towards
the
yew
-
tree
,
behind
which
he
ensconced
himself
.
<EOS>
Kelley
,
meanwhile
,
continued
to
ply
his
spade
with
a
vigour
that
seemed
almost
incomprehensible
in
one
so
far
stricken
in
years
,
and
of
such
infirm
appearance
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
paused
,
and
kneeling
within
the
shallow
grave
,
endeavoured
to
drag
something
from
it
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
knelt
to
assist
him
.
<EOS>
After
some
exertion
,
they
drew
forth
the
corpse
of
a
female
,
which
had
been
interred
without
coffin
,
and
apparently
in
the
habiliments
worn
during
life
.
<EOS>
A
horrible
suspicion
crossed
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Resolving
to
satisfy
his
doubts
at
once
,
he
rushed
forward
,
and
beheld
in
the
ghastly
lineaments
of
the
dead
the
features
of
the
unfortunate
prophetess
,
Elizabeth
Orton
.

Guy

in

voice
of
thunder

to
Doctor

and
his
companion
;
who
,
startled
by
his
sudden
appearance
,
dropped
the
body
,
and
retreated
to
a
short
distance
.
<EOS>
"
What
devilish
rites
are
ye
about
to
enact
,
that
ye
thus
profane
the
sanctity
of
the
grave?"Illustration"And
who
art
thou
that
darest
thus
to
interrupt
us
?
"
demanded
Dee
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
matters
not
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
striding
towards
them
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Suffice
it
<EOS>
you
are
both
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
You
,
John
Dee
,
warden
of
Manchester
,
who
deserve
to
be
burnt
at
the
stake
for
your
damnable
practices
,
rather
than
hold
the
sacred
office
you
fill
;
and
you
,
Edward
Kelley
,
his
associate
,
who
boast
of
familiar
intercourse
with
demons
,
and
,
unless
fame
belies
you
,
have
purchased
the
intimacy
at
the
price
of
your
soul
's
salvation
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
both
.
<EOS>
I
know
,
also
,
whose
body
you
have
disinterred
—
it
is
that
of
the
ill
-
fated
prophetess
,
Elizabeth
Orton
.
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
not
instantly
restore
it
to
the
grave
whence
you
have
snatched
it
,
I
will
denounce
you
to
the
authorities
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
""Knowing
<EOS>
thus
much
,
you
should
know
still
more
,
"
retorted
Doctor
Dee
,
"
namely
,
that
I
am
not
to
be
lightly
provoked
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
power
to
quit
the
churchyard
—
nay
,
not
so
much
as
to
move
a
limb
without
my
permission
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
drew
from
beneath
his
cloak
a
small
phial
,
the
contents
of
which
he
sprinkled
over
the
intruder
.
<EOS>
Its
effect
was
wonderful
and
instantaneous
.
<EOS>
The
limbs
of
Guy
Fawkes
stiffened
where
he
stood
.
<EOS>
His
hand
remained
immovably
fixed
upon
the
pommel
of
his
sword
,
and
he
seemed
transformed
into
a
marble
statue
.
<EOS>
"You
will
henceforth
acknowledge
and
respect
my
power
,
"
he
continued
.
<EOS>
"
Were
it
my
pleasure
,
I
could
bury
you
twenty
fathoms
deep
in
the
earth
beneath
our
feet
;
or
,
by
invoking
certain
spirits
,
convey
you
to
the
summit
of
yon
lofty
tower
,
"
pointing
to
the
church
,
"
and
hurl
you
from
it
headlong
.
<EOS>
But
I
content
myself
with
depriving
you
of
motion
,
and
leave
you
in
possession
of
sight
and
speech
,
that
you
may
endure
the
torture
of
witnessing
what
you
can
not
prevent
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
was
about
to
return
to
the
corpse
with
Kelley
,
when
Guy
Fawkes
exclaimed
,
in
a
hollow
voice,"Set
me
free
,
and
I
will
instantly
depart
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
swear
never
to
divulge
what
you
have
seen
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Dee
,
pausing
.
<EOS>
"Solemnly
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
will
trust
you
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
Doctor;—"the
rather
that
your
presence
interferes
with
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"Taking
<EOS>
a
handful
of
loose
earth
from
an
adjoining
grave
,
and
muttering
a
few
words
,
that
sounded
like
a
charm
<EOS>
,
he
scattered
it
over
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
The
spell
was
instantly
broken
.
<EOS>
A
leaden
weight
seemed
to
be
removed
from
his
limbs
.
<EOS>
His
joints
regained
their
suppleness
,
and
with
a
convulsive
start
,
like
that
by
which
a
dreamer
casts
off
a
nightmare
,
he
was
liberated
from
his
preternatural
thraldom
.
"And
<EOS>
now
,
begone
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Doctor
Dee
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"Suffer
<EOS>
me
to
tarry
with
you
a
few
moments
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
a
deferential
tone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heretofore
,
I
will
freely
admit
,
I
regarded
you
as
an
impostor
;
but
now
I
am
convinced
you
are
deeply
skilled
in
the
occult
sciences
,
and
would
fain
consult
you
on
the
future
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
said
that
your
presence
troubles
me
,
"
replied
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
if
you
will
call
upon
me
at
the
College
to
-
morrow
,
it
may
be
I
will
give
you
further
proofs
of
my
skill
.
<EOS>
""Why
not
now
,
reverend
sir
?
"
urged
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
The
question
I
would
ask
is
better
suited
to
this
dismal
spot
and
witching
hour
,
than
to
daylight
and
the
walls
of
your
study
.
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Dee
.
"
<EOS>
Your
name?""Guy
Fawkes
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
the
Doctor
,
starting
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
then
,
I
guess
the
nature
of
the
question
you
would
ask
.
<EOS>
""Am
<EOS>
I
then
known
to
you
,
reverend
sir
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fawkes
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
well
as
to
yourself
—
nay
,
better
,
"
answered
the
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
Bring
the
lantern
hither
,
Kelley
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
his
companion
.
"
<EOS>
Look
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
elevating
the
light
so
as
to
throw
it
upon
the
countenance
of
Fawkes
:
"
it
is
the
very
face,—the
bronzed
and
strongly
-
marked
features,—the
fierce
black
eye,—the
iron
frame
,
and
foreign
garb
of
the
figure
we
beheld
in
the
show
-
stone
.
<EOS>
""It
is
,
"
replied
Kelley
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
singled
him
out
amid
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
He
looked
thus
as
we
tracked
his
perilous
course
,
with
his
three
companions
,
the
priest
,
Chetham
,
and
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
across
Chat
Moss
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
have
you
learned
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
the
art
that
reveals
all
things
,
"
answered
Kelley
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
proof
that
your
thoughts
are
known
to
me
<EOS>
,
"
observed
Dee
,
"
I
will
tell
you
the
inquiry
you
would
make
before
it
is
uttered
.
<EOS>
You
would
learn
whether
the
enterprise
on
which
you
are
engaged
will
succeed
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Yet
<EOS>
more
,
"
continued
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
aware
of
the
nature
of
the
plot
,
and
could
name
to
you
all
connected
with
it
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
power
is
,
indeed
,
wonderful
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
in
an
altered
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
will
you
give
me
the
information
<EOS>
I
require?""Hum
!
"
muttered
Dee
.
<EOS>
"I
am
too
poor
to
purchase
it
,
"
proceeded
Fawkes
,
"
unless
a
relic
I
have
brought
from
Spain
has
any
value
in
your
eyes
.
<EOS>
"Illustration"Tush
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Dee
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
suppose
I
am
a
common
juggler
,
and
practise
my
art
for
gain?""By
no
means
,
reverend
sir
,
"
said
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
would
not
willingly
put
you
to
trouble
without
evincing
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
"
replied
Dee
,
"
I
will
not
refuse
your
request
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
would
caution
you
to
beware
how
you
pry
into
the
future
.
<EOS>
You
may
repent
your
rashness
when
it
is
too
late
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
know
the
worst
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
answered
Dee
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
That
carcass
having
been
placed
in
the
ground
without
the
holy
rites
of
burial
being
duly
performed
,
I
have
power
over
it
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
the
witch
of
Endor
called
up
Samuel
,
as
is
recorded
in
Holy
Writ,—as
Erichtho
raised
up
a
corpse
to
reveal
to
Sextus
Pompeius
<EOS>
the
event
of
the
Pharsalian
war,—as
Elisha
breathed
life
into
the
nostrils
of
the
Shunamite
's
son,—as
Alcestis
was
invoked
by
Hercules,—and
as
the
dead
maid
was
brought
back
to
life
by
Apollonius
Thyaneus,—so
I
,
by
certain
powerful
incantations
,
will
allure
the
soul
of
the
prophetess
,
for
a
short
space
,
to
its
former
tenement
,
and
compel
it
to
answer
my
questions
.
<EOS>
Dare
you
be
present
at
this
ceremony?""I
dare
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Follow
<EOS>
me
,
then
,
"
said
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
need
all
your
courage
.
<EOS>
"Muttering
<EOS>
a
hasty
prayer
,
and
secretly
crossing
himself
<EOS>
,
Guy
Fawkes
strode
after
him
towards
the
grave
.
<EOS>
By
the
Doctor
's
directions
,
he
,
with
some
reluctance
,
assisted
Kelley
to
raise
the
corpse
,
and
convey
it
to
the
charnel
.
<EOS>
Dee
followed
,
bearing
the
lantern
,
and
,
on
entering
the
building
,
closed
and
fastened
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
in
which
Guy
Fawkes
found
himself
was
in
perfect
keeping
with
the
horrible
ceremonial
about
to
be
performed
.
<EOS>
In
one
corner
lay
a
mouldering
heap
of
skulls
,
bones
,
and
other
fragments
of
mortality
;
in
the
other
a
pile
of
broken
coffins
,
emptied
of
their
tenants
,
and
reared
on
end
.
<EOS>
But
what
chiefly
attracted
his
attention
,
was
a
ghastly
collection
of
human
limbs
,
blackened
with
pitch
,
girded
round
with
iron
hoops
,
and
hung
,
like
meat
in
a
shambles
,
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
heads
,
and
,
though
the
features
were
scarcely
distinguishable
,
owing
to
the
liquid
in
which
they
had
been
immersed
,
they
still
retained
a
terrific
expression
of
agony
.
<EOS>
Seeing
his
attention
directed
to
these
revolting
objects
,
Kelley
informed
him
they
were
the
quarters
of
the
two
priests
who
had
recently
been
put
to
death
,
which
had
been
left
there
previously
to
being
placed
on
the
church
-
gates
.
<EOS>
The
implements
,
and
some
part
of
the
attire
used
by
the
executioner
in
his
butcherly
office
,
were
scattered
about
,
and
mixed
with
the
tools
of
the
sexton
;
while
in
the
centre
of
the
room
stood
a
large
wooden
frame
supported
by
trestles
.
<EOS>
On
this
frame
,
stained
with
blood
and
smeared
with
pitch
,
showing
the
purpose
to
which
it
had
been
recently
put
,
the
body
was
placed
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Doctor
Dee
set
down
the
lantern
beside
it
;
and
,
as
the
light
fell
upon
its
livid
features
,
sullied
with
earth
,
and
exhibiting
traces
of
decay
<EOS>
,
Guy
Fawkes
was
so
appalled
by
the
sight
that
he
half
repented
of
what
he
had
undertaken
.
<EOS>
Noticing
his
irresolution
,
Doctor
Dee
said
,
"
You
may
yet
retire
if
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
rousing
himself
;
"
I
will
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
,
"
replied
Dee
.
<EOS>
And
he
extinguished
the
light
.
<EOS>
An
awful
silence
now
ensued
,
broken
only
by
a
low
murmur
from
Doctor
Dee
,
who
appeared
to
be
reciting
an
incantation
.
<EOS>
As
he
proceeded
,
his
tones
became
louder
,
and
his
accents
those
of
command
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
he
paused
,
and
seemed
to
await
a
response
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
none
was
made
,
greatly
to
the
disappointment
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
whose
curiosity
,
notwithstanding
his
fears
,
was
raised
to
the
highest
pitch
<EOS>
,
he
cried
,
"
Blood
is
wanting
to
complete
the
charm
.
<EOS>
""If
that
is
all
<EOS>
,
I
will
speedily
supply
the
deficiency
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
;
and
,
drawing
his
rapier
<EOS>
,
he
bared
his
left
arm
,
and
pricked
it
deeply
with
the
point
of
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
bleed
now
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"Sprinkle
<EOS>
the
corpse
with
the
ruddy
current
,
"
rejoined
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
commands
are
obeyed
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
placed
my
hand
on
its
breast
,
and
the
blood
is
flowing
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
this
the
Doctor
began
to
mutter
an
incantation
in
a
louder
and
more
authoritative
tone
than
before
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
Kelley
added
his
voice
,
and
they
both
joined
in
a
sort
of
chorus
,
but
in
a
jargon
wholly
unintelligible
to
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
a
blue
flame
appeared
above
their
heads
,
and
,
slowly
descending
,
settled
upon
the
brow
of
the
corpse
,
lighting
up
the
sunken
cavities
of
the
eyes
,
and
the
discoloured
and
distorted
features
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
charm
works
,
"
shouted
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
moves
!
<EOS>
she
moves
!
"
exclaimed
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
alive!""Take
off
your
hand
,
"
cried
the
Doctor
,
"
or
mischief
may
ensue
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
again
continued
his
incantation
.
<EOS>
"Down
on
your
knees
!
<EOS>
"
he
exclaimed
,
at
length
,
in
a
terrible
voice
.
"
<EOS>
The
spirit
is
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
a
rushing
sound
,
and
a
stream
of
dazzling
lightning
shot
down
upon
the
corpse
,
which
emitted
a
hollow
groan
.
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
the
Doctor
's
commands
,
Guy
Fawkes
had
prostrated
himself
on
the
ground
:
but
he
kept
his
gaze
steadily
fixed
on
the
body
,
which
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
,
slowly
arose
,
until
it
stood
erect
upon
the
frame
.
<EOS>
There
it
remained
perfectly
motionless
,
with
the
arms
close
to
the
sides
,
and
the
habiliments
torn
and
dishevelled
.
<EOS>
The
blue
light
still
retained
its
position
upon
the
brow
,
and
communicated
a
horrible
glimmer
to
the
features
.
<EOS>
The
spectacle
was
so
dreadful
that
Guy
Fawkes
would
fain
have
averted
his
eyes
,
but
he
was
unable
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
and
his
companion
,
meanwhile
,
continued
their
invocations
,
until
,
as
it
seemed
to
Fawkes
,
the
lips
of
the
corpse
moved
,
and
an
awful
voice
exclaimed
,
"
Why
have
you
called
me?""Daughter
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Doctor
Dee
,
rising
,
"
in
life
thou
wert
endowed
with
the
gift
of
prophecy
.
<EOS>
In
the
grave
,
that
which
is
to
come
must
be
revealed
to
thee
.
<EOS>
We
would
question
thee
.
<EOS>
""Speak
<EOS>
,
and
I
will
answer
,
"
replied
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
"Interrogate
<EOS>
her
,
my
son
,
"
said
Dee
,
addressing
Fawkes
,
"
and
be
brief
,
for
the
time
is
short
.
<EOS>
So
long
only
as
that
flame
burns
have
I
power
over
her
.
<EOS>
""Spirit
of
Elizabeth
Orton
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
if
indeed
thou
standest
before
me
,
and
some
demon
hath
not
entered
thy
frame
to
delude
me,—by
<EOS>
all
that
is
holy
,
and
by
every
blessed
saint
,
I
adjure
thee
to
tell
me
whether
the
scheme
on
which
I
am
now
engaged
for
the
advantage
of
the
Catholic
Church
will
prosper?""Thou
art
mistaken
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
returned
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thy
scheme
is
not
for
the
advantage
of
the
Catholic
Church
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
pause
to
inquire
wherefore
,
"
continued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
grant
that
the
means
are
violent
and
wrongful
,
will
the
end
be
<EOS>
successful?""The
end
will
be
death
,
"
replied
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
tyrant
—
to
the
oppressors
?
"
demanded
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
conspirators
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
"
ejaculated
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Proceed
,
if
you
have
aught
more
to
ask
,
"
cried
Dr.
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
The
flame
is
expiring
.
<EOS>
""Shall
<EOS>
we
restore
the
fallen
religion
?
"
demanded
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
But
before
the
words
could
be
pronounced
the
light
vanished
,
and
a
heavy
sound
was
heard
,
as
of
the
body
falling
on
the
frame
.
<EOS>
"It
is
over
,
"
said
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
you
not
summon
her
again
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Fawkes
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
disappointment
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
other
questions
to
ask
.
<EOS>
""Impossible
,
"
replied
the
Doctor
.
<EOS>
"
The
spirit
is
fled
,
and
will
not
be
recalled
.
<EOS>
We
must
now
commit
the
body
to
the
earth
.
<EOS>
And
this
time
it
shall
be
more
decently
interred
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
curiosity
is
excited,—not
satisfied
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Would
it
were
to
occur
again!""It
is
ever
thus
,
"
replied
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
We
seek
to
know
that
which
is
interdicted,—and
quench
our
thirst
at
a
fountain
that
only
inflames
our
curiosity
the
more
.
<EOS>
Be
warned
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
You
are
embarked
on
a
perilous
enterprise
,
and
if
you
pursue
it
,
it
will
lead
you
to
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
retreat
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
"
and
would
not
,
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
I
am
bound
by
an
oath
too
terrible
to
be
broken
.
<EOS>
""I
will
absolve
you
of
your
oath
,
my
son
,
"
said
Dr.
Dee
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
can
not
,
reverend
sir
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
By
no
sophistry
could
I
clear
my
conscience
of
the
ties
imposed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
sworn
never
to
desist
from
the
execution
of
this
scheme
,
unless
those
engaged
in
it
shall
give
me
leave
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
resolved
am
I
,
that
if
I
stood
alone
I
would
go
on
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
a
deep
groan
issued
from
the
corpse
.
<EOS>
"You
are
again
warned
,
my
son
,
"
said
Dee
.
<EOS>
"Come
forth
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
rushing
towards
the
door
,
and
throwing
it
open
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
place
stifles
me
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
night
has
already
been
described
as
bright
and
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Before
him
stood
the
Collegiate
Church
bathed
in
moonlight
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
abstractedly
at
this
venerable
structure
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
returned
to
the
charnel
,
where
he
found
Doctor
Dee
and
Kelley
employed
in
placing
the
body
of
the
prophetess
in
a
coffin
,
which
they
had
taken
from
a
pile
in
the
corner
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
proffered
his
assistance
,
and
in
a
short
space
the
task
was
completed
.
<EOS>
The
coffin
was
then
borne
towards
the
grave
,
at
the
edge
of
which
it
was
laid
while
the
burial
-
service
was
recited
by
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
This
ended
,
it
was
lowered
into
its
shallow
resting
-
place
,
and
speedily
covered
with
earth
.
<EOS>
When
all
was
ready
for
their
departure
,
the
Doctor
turned
to
Fawkes
,
and
,
bidding
him
farewell
,
observed,"If
<EOS>
you
are
wise
,
my
son
,
you
will
profit
by
the
awful
warning
you
have
this
night
received
.
<EOS>
""Before
we
part
,
reverend
sir
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
I
would
ask
if
you
know
of
other
means
whereby
an
insight
may
be
obtained
into
the
future?""Many
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
magic
glass
,
in
which
,
with
due
preparation
,
you
may
behold
exact
representations
of
coming
events
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
returning
to
the
College
,
and
if
you
will
accompany
me
,
I
will
show
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
offer
was
eagerly
accepted
,
and
the
party
quitted
the
churchyard

—
THE
MAGIC
<EOS>
GLASSThe
old
College
of
Manchester
occupied
,
as
is
well
known
,
the
site
of
the
existing
structure
,
called
after
the
benevolent
individual
by
whom
that
admirable
charity
was
founded
,
and
whom
we
have
ventured
to
introduce
in
this
history,—the
Chetham
Hospital
.
<EOS>
Much
,
indeed
,
of
the
ancient
building
remains
;
for
though
it
was
considerably
repaired
and
enlarged
,
being
"
very
ruinous
and
in
great
decay
,
"
at
the
time
of
its
purchase
in
1654
,
by
the
feoffees
under
Humphrey
Chetham
's
will
,
from
the
sequestrators
of
the
Earl
of
Derby
's
estates
,
still
the
general
character
of
the
fabric
has
been
preserved
,
and
several
of
its
chambers
retained
.
<EOS>
Originally
built
on
the
foundation
of
a
manor
-
house
denominated
<EOS>
The
Baron
's
Hall,—the
abode
of
the
Grelleys
and
the
De
la
Warrs
,
lords
of
Manchester,—the
College
continued
to
be
used
as
the
residence
of
the
warden
and
fellows
of
the
Collegiate
Church
until
the
reign
of
Edward
the
First
,
when
that
body
was
dissolved
.
<EOS>
On
the
accession
,
however
,
of
Mary
,
the
College
was
re
-
established
;
but
the
residence
of
the
ecclesiastical
body
being
removed
to
a
house
in
Deansgate
,
the
building
was
allowed
to
become
extremely
dilapidated
,
and
was
used
partly
as
a
prison
for
recusants
and
other
offenders
,
and
partly
as
a
magazine
for
powder
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
Dr.
Dee
found
it
when
he
succeeded
to
the
wardenship
in
1595
,
and
preferring
it
,
notwithstanding
its
ruinous
condition
,
to
the
house
appointed
for
him
elsewhere
,
took
up
his
abode
within
it
.
<EOS>
Situated
on
a
high
rock
,
overhanging
the
river
Irk
—
at
that
time
a
clear
stream
,
remarkable
for
the
excellence
of
its
fish,—and
constructed
entirely
of
stone
,
the
old
College
had
then
,
and
still
has
to
a
certain
extent
,
a
venerable
and
monastic
appearance
.
<EOS>
During
Dee
's
occupation
of
it
,
it
became
a
sort
of
weird
abode
in
the
eyes
of
the
vulgar
,
and
many
a
timorous
look
was
cast
at
it
by
those
who
walked
at
eventide
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
Irk
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
the
curiosity
of
the
watchers
was
rewarded
by
beholding
a
few
sparks
issue
from
the
chimney
,
and
now
and
then
,
the
red
reflection
of
a
fire
might
be
discerned
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
But
generally
nothing
could
be
perceived
,
and
the
building
seemed
as
dark
and
mysterious
as
its
occupant
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
however
,
a
loud
explosion
took
place,—so
loud
,
indeed
,
that
it
shook
the
whole
pile
to
its
foundation
,
dislodged
one
or
two
of
the
chimneys
,
and
overthrew
an
old
wall
,
the
stones
of
which
rolled
into
the
river
beneath
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
concussion
,
the
inhabitants
of
Hunt
's
Bank
rushed
forth
,
and
saw
,
to
their
great
alarm
,
that
the
wing
of
the
college
occupied
by
Doctor
Dee
was
in
flames
.
<EOS>
Though
many
of
them
attributed
the
circumstance
to
supernatural
agency
,
and
were
fully
persuaded
that
the
enemy
of
mankind
was
at
that
instant
bearing
off
the
conjuror
and
his
assistant
,
and
refused
to
interfere
to
stop
the
conflagration
,
others
,
more
humane
and
less
superstitious
,
hastened
to
lend
their
aid
to
extinguish
the
flames
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
College
,
they
could
scarcely
credit
their
senses
on
finding
that
there
was
no
appearance
of
fire
;
and
they
were
met
by
the
Doctor
and
his
companion
at
the
gates
,
who
informed
them
that
their
presence
was
unnecessary
,
as
all
danger
was
over
.
<EOS>
From
that
night
Doctor
Dee
's
reputation
as
a
wizard
was
firmly
established
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
this
history
,
Doctor
Dee
was
fast
verging
on
eighty
,
having
passed
a
long
life
in
severe
and
abstruse
study
.
<EOS>
He
had
travelled
much
,
had
visited
most
of
the
foreign
courts
,
where
he
was
generally
well
received
,
and
was
profoundly
versed
in
mathematics
,
astronomy
,
the
then
popular
science
of
judicial
astrology
,
and
other
occult
learning
.
<EOS>
So
accurate
were
his
calculations
esteemed
,
that
he
was
universally
consulted
as
an
oracle
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
he
resided
in
Germany
,
where
he
was
invited
by
the
Emperor
Charles
the
Fifth
,
and
retained
by
his
brother
and
successor
,
Ferdinando
.
<EOS>
He
next
went
to
Louvain
,
where
his
reputation
had
preceded
him
;
and
from
thence
to
Paris
,
where
he
lectured
at
the
schools
on
geometry
,
and
was
offered
a
professorship
of
the
university
,
but
declined
it
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
to
England
in
1551
,
he
was
appointed
one
of
the
instructors
of
the
youthful
monarch
,
Edward
the
Sixth
,
who
presented
him
with
an
annual
pension
of
a
hundred
marks
.
<EOS>
This
he
was
permitted
to
commute
for
the
rectory
of
Upton
-
upon
-
Severn
,
which
he
retained
until
the
accession
of
Mary
,
when
being
charged
with
devising
her
Majesty
's
destruction
by
<EOS>
enchantments,—certain
waxen
images
of
the
Queen
having
been
found
within
his
abode,—he
was
thrown
into
prison
,
rigorously
treated
,
and
kept
in
durance
for
a
long
period
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
from
want
of
sufficient
proof
against
him
,
he
was
liberated
.
<EOS>
Dee
shared
the
common
fate
of
all
astrologers
:
he
was
alternately
honoured
and
disgraced
.
<EOS>
His
next
patron
was
Lord
Robert
Dudley
(
afterwards
the
celebrated
Earl
of
Leicester
)
,
who
,
it
is
well
-
known
,
was
a
firm
believer
in
the
superstitious
arts
to
which
Dee
was
addicted
,
and
by
whom
he
was
employed
,
on
the
accession
of
Elizabeth
,
to
erect
a
scheme
to
ascertain
the
best
day
for
her
coronation
.
<EOS>
His
prediction
was
so
fortunate
that
it
procured
him
the
favour
of
the
Queen
,
from
whom
he
received
many
marks
of
regard
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
not
needful
to
follow
him
through
his
various
wanderings
,
it
may
be
sufficient
to
mention
,
that
in
1564
he
proceeded
to
Germany
on
a
visit
to
the
Emperor
Maximilian
,
to
whom
he
dedicated
his
"
Monas
Hieroglyphica
;
"
that
in
1571
he
fell
grievously
sick
in
Lorrain
,
whither
two
physicians
were
despatched
to
his
aid
by
Elizabeth
;
and
that
on
his
recovery
he
returned
to
his
own
country
,
and
retired
to
Mortlake
,
where
he
gathered
together
a
vast
library
,
comprising
the
rarest
and
most
curious
works
on
all
sciences
,
together
with
a
large
collection
of
manuscripts
.
<EOS>
While
thus
living
in
retirement
,
he
was
sought
out
by
Edward
Kelley
,
a
native
of
Worcestershire
,
who
represented
himself
as
in
possession
of
an
old
book
of
magic
,
containing
forms
of
invocation
,
by
which
spirits
might
be
summoned
and
controlled
,
as
well
as
a
ball
of
ivory
,
found
in
the
tomb
of
a
bishop
who
had
made
great
progress
in
hermetic
philosophy
,
which
was
filled
with
the
powder
of
projection
.
<EOS>
These
treasures
Kelley
offered
to
place
in
the
hands
of
the
Doctor
on
certain
conditions
,
which
were
immediately
acquiesced
in
,
and
thenceforth
Kelley
became
a
constant
inmate
in
his
house
,
and
an
assistant
in
all
his
practices
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
they
were
joined
by
a
Polish
nobleman
,
Albert
de
Laski
,
Palatine
of
Suabia
,
whom
they
accompanied
to
Prague
,
at
the
instance
of
the
Emperor
Rodolph
the
Second
,
who
desired
to
be
initiated
into
their
mysteries
.
<EOS>
Their
reception
at
this
court
was
not
such
as
to
induce
a
long
sojourn
at
it
;
and
Dee
having
been
warned
by
his
familiar
spirits
to
sell
his
effects
and
depart
,
complied
with
the
intimation
,
and
removed
to
Poland
.
<EOS>
The
same
fate
attended
him
here
.
<EOS>
The
nuncio
of
the
Pope
denounced
him
as
a
sorcerer
,
and
demanded
that
he
should
be
delivered
up
to
the
Inquisition
.
<EOS>
This
was
refused
by
the
monarch
;
but
Dee
and
his
companion
were
banished
from
his
dominions
,
and
compelled
to
fly
to
Bohemia
,
where
they
took
refuge
in
the
castle
of
Trebona
,
belonging
to
Count
Rosenberg
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Dee
and
Kelley
separated
,
the
magical
instruments
being
delivered
to
the
former
,
who
bent
his
course
homewards
;
and
on
his
arrival
in
London
was
warmly
welcomed
by
the
Queen
.
<EOS>
During
his
absence
,
his
house
at
Mortlake
had
been
broken
open
by
the
populace
,
under
the
pretence
of
its
being
the
abode
of
a
wizard
,
and
rifled
of
its
valuable
library
and
manuscripts,—a
loss
severely
felt
by
its
owner
.
<EOS>
Some
years
were
now
passed
by
Dee
in
great
destitution
,
during
which
he
prosecuted
his
studies
with
the
same
ardour
as
before
,
until
at
length
in
1595
,
when
he
was
turned
seventy
,
fortune
again
smiled
upon
him
,
and
he
was
appointed
to
the
wardenship
of
the
College
at
Manchester
,
whither
he
repaired
,
and
was
installed
in
great
pomp
.
<EOS>
But
his
residence
in
this
place
was
not
destined
to
be
a
tranquil
one
.
<EOS>
His
reputation
as
a
dealer
in
the
black
art
had
preceded
him
,
and
rendered
him
obnoxious
to
the
clergy
,
with
whom
he
had
constant
disputes
,
and
a
feud
subsisted
between
him
and
the
fellows
of
his
church
.
<EOS>
It
has
already
been
mentioned
that
he
refused
to
occupy
the
house
allotted
him
,
but
preferred
taking
up
his
quarters
in
the
old
dilapidated
College
.
<EOS>
Various
reasons
were
assigned
by
his
enemies
for
this
singular
choice
of
abode
.
<EOS>
They
affirmed
—
and
with
some
reason
—
that
he
selected
it
because
he
desired
to
elude
observation,—and
that
his
mode
of
life
,
sufficiently
improper
in
a
layman
,
was
altogether
indecorous
in
an
ecclesiastic
.
<EOS>
By
the
common
people
he
was
universally
regarded
as
a
conjuror
—
and
many
at
first
came
to
consult
him
;
but
he
peremptorily
dismissed
all
such
applicants
;
and
,
when
seven
females
,
supposed
to
be
possessed
,
were
brought
to
him
that
he
might
exercise
his
power
over
the
evil
spirits
,
he
refused
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
He
also
publicly
examined
and
rebuked
a
juggler
,
named
Hartley
,
who
pretended
to
magical
knowledge
.
<EOS>
But
these
things
did
not
blind
his
enemies
,
who
continued
to
harass
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
addressed
a
petition
to
James
the
First
,
entreating
to
be
brought
to
trial
,
when
the
accusations
preferred
against
him
might
be
fully
investigated
,
and
his
character
cleared
.
<EOS>
The
application
,
and
another
to
the
like
effect
addressed
to
parliament
,
were
disregarded
.
<EOS>
Dee
had
not
been
long
established
in
Manchester
when
he
was
secretly
joined
by
Kelley
,
and
they
recommenced
their
search
after
the
grand
secret,—passing
the
nights
in
making
various
alchymical
experiments
,
or
in
fancied
conferences
with
invisible
beings
.
<EOS>
Among
other
magical
articles
possessed
by
Doctor
Dee
was
a
large
globe
of
crystal
,
which
he
termed
the
Holy
Stone
,
because
he
believed
it
had
been
brought
him
by
"
angelical
ministry
;
"
and
"
in
which
,
"
according
to
Meric
Casaubon
,
"
and
out
of
which
,
by
persons
qualified
for
it
,
and
admitted
to
the
sight
of
it
,
all
shapes
and
figures
mentioned
in
every
action
were
seen
,
and
voices
heard
.
<EOS>
"
The
same
writer
informs
us
<EOS>
it
was
"
round
-
shaped
,
of
a
pretty
bigness
,
and
most
like
unto
crystal
.
<EOS>
"
Dee
himself
declared
to
the
Emperor
Rodolph
,
"
that
the
spirits
had
brought
him
a
stone
of
that
value
that
no
earthly
kingdom
was
of
such
worthiness
as
to
be
compared
to
the
virtue
and
dignity
thereof
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
habit
of
daily
consulting
this
marvellous
stone
,
and
recording
the
visions
he
saw
therein
,
and
the
conferences
he
held
through
it
with
the
invisible
world
.
<EOS>
Followed
by
Guy
Fawkes
and
Kelley
,
the
Doctor
took
his
way
down
Long
Mill
Gate
,
and
stopping
at
an
arched
gateway
on
the
left
,
near
which
,
on
the
site
of
the
modern
structure
,
stood
the
public
school
,
founded
a
century
before
by
Hugh
Oldham
,
Bishop
of
Exeter,—he
unlocked
a
small
wicket
,
and
entered
a
spacious
court
,
surrounded
on
one
side
by
high
stone
walls
,
and
on
the
other
by
a
wing
of
the
College
.
<EOS>
Conducting
his
guest
to
the
principal
entrance
of
the
building
,
which
lay
at
the
farther
end
of
the
court
,
Doctor
Dee
ushered
him
into
a
large
chamber
,
panelled
with
oak
,
and
having
a
curiously
-
moulded
ceiling
,
ornamented
with
grotesque
sculpture
.
<EOS>
This
room
,
still
in
existence
,
and
now
occupied
by
the
master
of
the
school
,
formed
Doctor
Dee
's
library
.
<EOS>
Offering
Fawkes
a
chair
,
the
Doctor
informed
him
that
when
all
was
ready
,
Kelley
should
summon
him
,
and
,
accompanied
by
his
assistant
,
he
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
elapsed
before
Kelley
returned
.
<EOS>
Motioning
Guy
Fawkes
to
follow
him
<EOS>
,
he
led
the
way
through
several
intricate
passages
to
a
chamber
which
was
evidently
the
magician
's
sacred
retreat
.
<EOS>
In
a
recess
on
one
side
stood
a
table
,
covered
with
cabalistic
characters
and
figures
,
referring
to
the
celestial
influences
.
<EOS>
On
it
was
placed
the
holy
stone
,
diffusing
such
a
glistening
radiance
as
is
emitted
by
the
pebble
called
cat's
-
eye
.
<EOS>
On
the
floor
a
wide
circle
was
described
,
in
the
rings
of
which
magical
characters
,
resembling
those
on
the
table
,
were
traced
.
<EOS>
In
front
stood
a
brasier
,
filled
with
flaming
coals
;
and
before
it
hung
a
heavy
black
curtain
,
appearing
to
shroud
some
mystery
from
view
.
<EOS>
Desiring
Fawkes
to
place
himself
in
the
centre
of
the
circle
,
Doctor
Dee
took
several
ingredients
from
a
basket
handed
him
by
Kelley
,
and
cast
them
into
the
brasier
.
<EOS>
As
each
herb
or
gum
was
ignited
,
the
flame
changed
its
colour
;
now
becoming
crimson
,
now
green
,
now
blue
,
while
fragrant
or
noxious
odours
loaded
the
atmosphere
.
<EOS>
These
suffumigations
ended
,
Dee
seated
himself
on
a
chair
near
the
table
,
whither
<EOS>
he
was
followed
by
Kelley
,
and
commanding
Fawkes
not
to
move
a
footstep
,
as
he
valued
his
safety
,
he
waved
his
wand
,
and
began
in
a
solemn
tone
to
utter
an
invocation
.
<EOS>
As
he
continued
,
a
hollow
noise
was
heard
overhead
,
which
gradually
increased
in
loudness
,
until
it
appeared
as
if
the
walls
were
tumbling
about
their
ears
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
spirits
are
at
hand
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
look
behind
you
,
or
they
will
tear
you
in
pieces
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
a
horrible
din
was
heard
,
as
of
mingled
howling
,
shrieking
,
and
laughter
.
<EOS>
It
was
succeeded
by
a
low
faint
strain
of
music
,
which
gradually
died
away
,
and
then
all
was
silent
.
<EOS>
"All
is
prepared
,
"
cried
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Now
,
what
would
you
<EOS>
behold?""The
progress
of
the
great
enterprise
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
waved
his
wand
.
<EOS>
The
curtains
slowly
unfolded
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
perceived
as
in
a
glass
a
group
of
dark
figures
;
amongst
which
he
noticed
one
in
all
respects
resembling
himself
.
<EOS>
A
priest
was
apparently
proposing
an
oath
,
which
the
others
were
uttering
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
recognise
them
?
"
said
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
"Perfectly
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Look
<EOS>
again
,
"
said
Dee
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
the
figures
melted
away
,
and
a
new
scene
was
presented
on
the
glass
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
gloomy
vault
,
filled
with
barrels
,
partly
covered
with
fagots
and
billets
of
wood
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
seen
enough
?
"
demanded
Dee
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
what
is
past
.
<EOS>
I
would
behold
that
which
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
""Look
<EOS>
again
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
Doctor
,
waving
his
wand
.
<EOS>
For
an
instant
the
glass
was
darkened
,
and
nothing
could
be
discerned
except
the
lurid
flame
and
thick
smoke
arising
from
the
brasier
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
an
icy
chill
shot
through
the
frame
of
Guy
Fawkes
as
he
beheld
a
throng
of
skeletons
arranged
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
bony
fingers
of
the
foremost
of
the
grisly
assemblage
were
pointed
towards
an
indistinct
object
at
its
feet
.
<EOS>
As
this
object
gradually
became
more
defined
,
Guy
Fawkes
perceived
that
it
was
a
figure
resembling
himself
,
stretched
upon
the
wheel
,
and
writhing
in
the
agonies
of
torture
.
<EOS>
He
uttered
an
exclamation
of
terror
,
and
the
curtains
were
instantly
closed
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
,
Guy
Fawkes
quitted
the
College
,
and
returned
to
the
Seven
Stars
.

<EOS>
THE
PRISON
ON
SALFORD
BRIDGEOn
<EOS>
the
following
morning
,
Guy
Fawkes
had
a
long
and
private
conference
with
Father
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
The
priest
appeared
greatly
troubled
by
the
communication
made
to
him
,
but
he
said
nothing
,
and
was
for
some
time
lost
in
reflection
,
and
evidently
weighing
within
himself
what
course
it
would
be
best
to
pursue
.
<EOS>
His
uneasiness
was
not
without
effect
on
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
and
she
ventured
at
last
to
inquire
whether
he
apprehended
any
new
danger
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
scarcely
know
what
I
apprehend
,
dear
daughter
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
But
circumstances
have
occurred
which
render
it
impossible
<EOS>
we
can
remain
longer
in
our
present
asylum
with
safety
.
<EOS>
We
must
quit
it
at
nightfall
.
<EOS>
""Is
our
retreat
then
discovered
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Viviana
,
in
alarm
.
"Not
<EOS>
as
yet
,
I
trust
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
;
"
but
I
have
just
ascertained
from
a
messenger
that
the
pursuivant
,
who
,
we
thought
,
had
departed
for
Chester
,
is
still
lingering
within
the
town
.
<EOS>
He
has
offered
a
large
reward
for
my
apprehension
,
and
having
traced
us
to
Manchester
,
declares
he
will
leave
no
house
unsearched
till
he
finds
us
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
together
a
fresh
band
of
soldiers
,
and
is
now
visiting
every
place
he
thinks
likely
to
afford
us
shelter
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
this
is
the
case
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
"
why
remain
here
a
single
moment
?
<EOS>
Let
us
fly
at
once
.
<EOS>
""That
would
avail
nothing,—or
rather
,
it
would
expose
us
to
fresh
risk
,
dear
daughter
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
Every
approach
to
the
town
is
guarded
,
and
soldiers
are
posted
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
,
who
stop
and
examine
each
suspected
person
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
protect
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
this
is
not
all
,
"
continued
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
By
some
inexplicable
and
mysterious
means
,
the
designs
of
certain
of
the
most
assured
friends
of
the
catholic
cause
have
come
to
the
knowledge
of
our
enemies
,
and
the
lives
and
safeties
of
many
worthy
men
will
be
endangered
:
amongst
others
,
that
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
terrify
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
rack
shall
force
nothing
from
me
,
father
,
"
said
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
from
me
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
that
within
me
which
will
enable
me
to
sustain
the
bitterest
agonies
that
the
persecutors
of
our
Church
can
inflict
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
shall
it
force
aught
from
me
,
"
added
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
For
,
though
you
have
trusted
me
with
nothing
that
can
implicate
others
,
I
plainly
perceive
some
plot
is
in
agitation
for
the
restoration
of
our
religion
,
and
I
more
than
suspect
Mr.
Catesby
is
its
chief
contriver
.
<EOS>
""Daughter
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Oldcorne
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Fear
<EOS>
nothing
,
father
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
said
,
the
rack
shall
not
force
me
to
betray
you
.
<EOS>
Neither
should
it
keep
me
silent
when
I
feel
that
my
counsel
—
such
as
it
is
—
may
avail
you
.
<EOS>
The
course
you
are
pursuing
is
a
dangerous
and
fatal
one
;
dangerous
to
yourselves
,
and
fatal
to
the
cause
you
would
serve
.
<EOS>
Do
not
deceive
yourselves
.
<EOS>
You
are
struggling
hopelessly
and
unrighteously
,
and
Heaven
will
never
assist
an
undertaking
which
has
its
aim
in
the
terrible
waste
of
life
you
meditate
.
<EOS>
"Father
<EOS>
Oldcorne
made
no
reply
,
but
walked
apart
with
Guy
Fawkes
;
and
Viviana
abandoned
herself
to
sorrowful
reflection
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
,
and
Humphrey
Chetham
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
His
looks
were
full
of
apprehension
,
and
Viviana
was
at
no
loss
to
perceive
that
some
calamity
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
pursuivant
and
his
men
are
below
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
interrogating
the
hostess
,
and
are
about
to
search
the
house
.
<EOS>
I
managed
to
pass
them
unperceived
.
<EOS>
""We
will
resist
them
to
the
last
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
drawing
a
petronel
.
<EOS>
"Resistance
will
be
in
vain
,
"
rejoined
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
They
more
than
treble
our
number
.
<EOS>
""Is
there
<EOS>
no
means
of
escape
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
I
hear
them
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
terrified
hostess
has
not
dared
to
deny
you
,
and
is
conducting
them
hither
.
<EOS>
""Stand
<EOS>
back
!
"
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
striding
towards
the
door
,
"
and
let
me
alone
confront
them
.
<EOS>
That
accursed
pursuivant
has
escaped
me
once
.
<EOS>
But
he
shall
not
do
so
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
""My
son
,
"
said
Oldcorne
,
advancing
towards
him
;
"
preserve
yourself
,
if
possible
.
<EOS>
Your
life
is
of
consequence
to
the
great
cause
.
<EOS>
Think
not
of
us
—
think
not
of
revenging
yourself
upon
this
caitiff
.
<EOS>
But
think
of
the
high
destiny
for
which
you
are
reserved
.
<EOS>
That
window
offers
a
means
of
retreat
.
<EOS>
Avail
yourself
of
it
.
<EOS>
Fly!—Fly!""Ay
,
fly
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
,
Humphrey
Chetham,—your
presence
here
can
do
no
good
.
<EOS>
Quick!—they
come!""Nothing
should
induce
me
to
quit
you
at
such
a
moment
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
"
but
the
conviction
that
I
may
be
able
to
liberate
you
,
should
these
miscreants
convey
you
to
prison
.
<EOS>
""Fly!—fly
,
my
son
,
"
cried
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Thus
urged
,
Guy
Fawkes
reluctantly
yielded
to
Oldcorne
's
entreaties
and
sprang
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Chetham
.
<EOS>
Viviana
darted
to
the
casement
,
and
saw
that
they
had
alighted
in
safety
on
the
ground
,
and
were
flying
swiftly
up
Shude
Hill
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
pursuivant
had
reached
the
door
,
which
Chetham
had
taken
the
precaution
to
fasten
,
and
was
trying
to
burst
it
open
.
<EOS>
The
bolts
offered
but
a
feeble
resistance
to
his
fury
,
and
the
next
moment
he
dashed
into
the
room
,
at
the
head
of
a
band
of
soldiers
.
<EOS>
"Seize
them
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
glancing
round
the
room
with
a
look
of
disappointment
,
"
where
are
the
others
?
<EOS>
Where
is
the
soldier
in
the
Spanish
garb
?
<EOS>
Where
is
Humphrey
Chetham
?
<EOS>
Confess
at
once
,
dog
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
seizing
the
priest
by
the
throat
,
"
or
I
will
pluck
the
secret
from
your
breast
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
harm
him
,
"
interposed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
the
question
.
<EOS>
They
are
fled
.
<EOS>
""Fled
!
"
echoed
the
pursuivant
in
consternation
.
"
<EOS>
How?""Through
that
window
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"After
them
!
"
cried
the
pursuivant
to
some
of
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
"
Take
the
soldier
,
dead
or
alive
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
he
continued
,
as
his
orders
were
obeyed
,
"
you
,
Father
Oldcorne
,
Jesuit
and
traitor
;
and
you
,
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
his
shelterer
and
abettor
,
I
shall
convey
you
both
to
the
prison
on
Salford
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Seize
them
,
and
bring
them
along
.
<EOS>
""Touch
<EOS>
me
not
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
pushing
the
men
aside
,
who
rudely
advanced
to
obey
their
leader
's
command
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
no
warrant
for
this
brutality
.
<EOS>
I
am
ready
to
attend
you
.
<EOS>
Take
my
arm
,
father
.
"Abashed
<EOS>
at
this
reproof
,
the
pursuivant
stalked
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Surrounded
by
the
soldiers
,
Viviana
and
the
priest
followed
.
<EOS>
The
sad
procession
was
attended
by
crowds
to
the
very
door
of
the
prison
,
where
,
by
the
pursuivant
's
commands
,
they
were
locked
in
separate
cells
.
<EOS>
The
cell
in
which
Viviana
was
confined
was
a
small
chamber
at
the
back
of
the
prison
,
and
on
the
upper
story
.
<EOS>
It
had
a
small
grated
window
overlooking
the
river
.
<EOS>
It
has
already
been
mentioned
that
this
prison
was
originally
a
chapel
built
in
the
reign
of
Edward
the
Third
,
and
had
only
recently
been
converted
into
a
place
of
security
for
recusants
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
allotted
to
Viviana
was
contrived
in
the
roof
,
and
was
so
low
that
she
could
scarcely
stand
upright
in
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
furnished
with
a
chair
,
a
small
table
,
and
a
straw
pallet
.
<EOS>
The
hours
passed
wearily
with
Viviana
as
they
were
marked
by
the
deep
-
toned
clock
of
the
Collegiate
Church
,
the
tall
tower
of
which
fronted
her
window
.
<EOS>
Oppressed
by
the
most
melancholy
reflections
,
she
was
for
some
time
a
prey
almost
to
despair
.
<EOS>
On
whatever
side
she
looked
,
the
prospect
was
equally
cheerless
,
and
her
sole
desire
was
that
she
might
find
a
refuge
from
her
cares
in
the
seclusion
of
a
convent
.
<EOS>
For
this
she
prayed,—and
<EOS>
she
prayed
also
that
Heaven
would
soften
the
hearts
of
her
oppressors
,
and
enable
those
who
suffered
to
endure
their
yoke
with
patience
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
provisions
were
brought
her
,
and
placed
upon
the
table
,
together
with
a
lamp
,
by
a
surly
looking
gaoler
.
<EOS>
But
Viviana
had
no
inclination
to
eat
,
and
left
them
untouched
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
she
prevail
upon
herself
to
lie
down
on
the
wretched
pallet
,
and
she
therefore
determined
to
pass
the
night
in
the
chair
.
<EOS>
After
some
hours
of
watchfulness
,
her
eyelids
closed
,
and
she
continued
to
slumber
until
she
was
aroused
by
a
slight
noise
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
Starting
at
the
sound
,
she
flew
towards
it
,
and
perceived
in
the
gloom
the
face
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
uttered
a
loud
cry
,
when
the
circumstances
of
her
situation
rushed
to
her
mind
,
and
the
possibility
that
it
might
be
a
friend
checked
her
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
satisfied
her
that
she
had
acted
rightly
.
<EOS>
A
voice
,
which
she
recognised
as
that
of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
called
to
her
by
name
in
a
low
tone
,
bidding
her
fear
nothing
,
as
he
was
come
to
set
her
free
.
"How
<EOS>
have
you
managed
to
reach
this
window
?
"
asked
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
a
rope
ladder
<EOS>
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
contrived
in
the
darkness
to
clamber
upon
the
roof
of
the
prison
from
the
parapets
of
the
bridge
,
and
,
after
securing
the
ladder
to
a
projection
,
dropped
the
other
end
into
a
boat
,
rowed
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
concealed
beneath
the
arches
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
remove
this
bar
so
as
to
allow
you
to
pass
through
the
window
,
dare
you
descend
the
ladder?""No
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
shuddering
.
<EOS>
"
My
brain
reels
at
the
mere
idea
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
of
the
fate
you
will
escape
,
"
urged
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
Father
Oldcorne
?
"
asked
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
he?""In
the
cell
immediately
beneath
you
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
you
not
liberate
him
?
<EOS>
"
she
continued
.
<EOS>
"Assuredly
,
if
he
will
risk
the
descent
,
"
answered
Chetham
,
reluctantly
.
<EOS>
"Free
him
first
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
"
and
<EOS>
at
all
hazards
<EOS>
I
will
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
merchant
made
no
reply
,
but
disappeared
from
the
window
.
<EOS>
Viviana
strained
her
gaze
downwards
;
but
it
was
too
dark
to
allow
her
to
see
anything
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
heard
a
noise
like
that
occasioned
by
a
file
;
and
shortly
afterwards
a
few
muttered
words
informed
her
that
the
priest
was
passing
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
cords
of
the
ladder
shook
against
the
bars
of
her
<EOS>
window,—and
<EOS>
she
held
her
breath
for
fear
.
<EOS>
From
this
state
of
suspense
she
was
relieved
in
a
few
minutes
by
Humphrey
Chetham
,
who
informed
her
that
Oldcorne
had
descended
in
safety
,
and
was
in
the
boat
with
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"I
will
fulfil
my
promise
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
trembling
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
my
strength
will
fail
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
had
better
find
death
below
than
tarry
here
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
who
as
he
spoke
was
rapidly
filing
through
the
iron
bar
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
a
few
minutes
this
impediment
will
be
removed
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
merchant
worked
hard
,
and
in
a
short
time
the
stout
bar
yielded
to
his
efforts
.
<EOS>
"Now
,
then
,
"
he
cried
,
springing
into
the
room
,
"
you
are
free
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
dare
not
make
the
attempt
,
"
said
Viviana
;
"
my
strength
utterly
fails
me
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
then
,
"
he
replied
;
"
I
will
take
the
risk
upon
myself
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
,
and
bore
her
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
,
and
no
little
risk
,
he
succeeded
in
gaining
a
footing
on
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
This
accomplished
,
he
began
slowly
to
descend
.
<EOS>
When
half
way
down
,
he
found
he
had
overrated
his
strength
,
and
he
feared
he
should
be
compelled
to
quit
his
hold
;
but
,
nerved
by
his
passion
,
he
held
on
,
and
making
a
desperate
effort
,
completed
the
descent
in
safety
.

X.
—
<EOS>
THE
FATE
OF
THE
PURSUIVANTAssisted
by
the
stream
,
and
plying
his
oars
with
great
rapidity
<EOS>
,
Guy
Fawkes
soon
left
the
town
far
behind
him
;
nor
did
he
relax
his
exertions
until
checked
by
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
He
then
ceased
rowing
,
and
directed
the
boats
towards
the
left
bank
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
we
propose
to
land
,
"
observed
the
young
merchant
to
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
from
Ordsall
Cave
,
where
you
can
take
refuge
for
a
short
time
,
while
I
proceed
to
the
Hall
,
and
ascertain
whether
you
can
return
to
it
with
safety
.
<EOS>
""I
place
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
,
"
she
replied
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
fear
such
a
course
will
be
to
rush
into
the
very
face
of
danger
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
that
I
could
join
my
father
at
Holywell
!
<EOS>
With
him
I
should
feel
secure
.
<EOS>
""Means
may
be
found
to
effect
your
wishes
,
"
returned
Humphrey
Chetham
;
"
but
,
after
the
suffering
you
have
recently
endured
,
it
will
scarcely
be
prudent
to
undertake
so
long
a
journey
without
a
few
hours
'
repose
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow,—or
the
next
day,—you
may
set
out
.
<EOS>
""I
am
fully
equal
to
it
now
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
eagerly
;
"
and
any
fatigue
I
may
undergo
will
not
equal
my
present
anxiety
.
<EOS>
You
have
already
done
so
much
for
me
,
that
I
venture
to
presume
still
further
upon
your
kindness
.
<EOS>
Provide
some
means
of
conveyance
for
me
and
for
Father
Oldcorne
to
Chester
,
and
I
shall
for
ever
be
beholden
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
not
only
do
what
you
desire
,
Viviana
<EOS>
,
if
it
be
possible
,
"
answered
Chetham
;
"
but
,
if
you
will
allow
me
,
I
will
serve
as
your
escort
.
<EOS>
""And
I
,
also
,
"
added
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
I
fear
is
,
that
your
strength
may
fail
you
,
"
continued
the
young
merchant
,
in
a
tone
of
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"Fear
<EOS>
nothing
then
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
made
of
firmer
material
than
you
imagine
.
<EOS>
Think
only
of
what
you
can
do
,
and
doubt
not
my
ability
to
do
it
,
also
.
<EOS>
""I
ever
deemed
you
of
a
courageous
nature
,
daughter
,
"
observed
Oldcorne
;
"
but
your
resolution
surpasses
my
belief
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
the
boat
had
approached
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Leaping
upon
the
rocky
bank
,
the
young
merchant
assisted
Viviana
to
land
,
and
then
performed
the
same
service
for
the
priest
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
the
last
to
disembark
;
and
,
having
pulled
the
skiff
aground
,
he
followed
the
others
,
who
waited
for
him
at
a
short
distance
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
profoundly
dark
,
and
the
path
they
had
taken
,
being
shaded
by
large
trees
,
was
scarcely
discernible
.
<EOS>
Carefully
guiding
Viviana
,
who
leaned
on
him
for
support
,
the
young
merchant
proceeded
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
with
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
they
were
surprised
and
alarmed
by
a
vivid
blaze
of
light
bursting
through
the
trees
on
the
left
.
<EOS>
"Some
building
must
be
on
fire
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
is
Ordsall
Hall,—it
is
your
father
's
residence
,
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
work
of
that
accursed
pursuivant
,
I
will
be
sworn
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
it
be
so
,
<EOS>
may
Heaven
's
fire
consume
him
!
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
I
thought
myself
equal
to
every
calamity
;
but
this
new
stroke
of
fate
is
more
than
I
can
bear
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
she
spoke
,
the
conflagration
evidently
increased
.
<EOS>
The
sky
was
illumined
by
the
red
reflection
of
the
flames
;
and
as
the
party
hurried
forward
to
a
rising
ground
,
whence
a
better
view
could
be
obtained
of
the
spectacle
,
they
saw
the
dark
walls
of
the
ancient
mansion
apparently
wrapped
in
the
devouring
element
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
hasten
thither
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"I
and
Guy
Fawkes
will
fly
there
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
,
"
and
render
all
the
assistance
in
our
power
.
<EOS>
But
,
first
,
let
me
convey
you
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
"More
<EOS>
dead
than
alive
,
Viviana
suffered
herself
to
be
borne
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
Making
his
way
over
every
impediment
,
Chetham
soon
reached
the
excavation
;
and
depositing
his
lovely
burthen
upon
the
stone
couch
,
and
leaving
her
in
charge
of
the
priest
,
he
hurried
with
Guy
Fawkes
towards
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
termination
of
the
avenue
,
they
found
,
to
their
great
relief
,
that
it
was
not
the
main
structure
,
but
an
outbuilding
which
was
in
flames
,
and
from
its
situation
the
young
merchant
conceived
it
to
be
the
stables
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
made
this
discovery
,
they
slackened
their
pace
,
being
apprehensive
,
from
the
shouts
and
other
sounds
that
reached
them
,
that
some
hostile
party
might
be
among
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
drawbridge
—
which
was
fortunately
<EOS>
lowered,—they
were
about
to
shape
their
course
towards
the
stables
,
which
lay
at
the
further
side
of
the
Hall
,
when
they
perceived
the
old
steward
,
Heydocke
,
standing
at
the
doorway
and
wringing
his
hands
in
distraction
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
immediately
called
to
him
.
<EOS>
"I
should
know
that
voice
!
"
cried
the
old
man
,
stepping
forward
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Chetham
,
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
You
are
arrived
at
a
sad
time
,
sir
—
a
sad
time
—
to
see
the
old
house
,
where
I
have
dwelt
,
man
and
boy
,
sixty
years
and
more
,
in
flames
.
<EOS>
But
one
calamity
has
trodden
upon
the
heels
of
another
.
<EOS>
Ever
since
Sir
William
departed
for
Holywell
nothing
has
gone
right
—
<EOS>
nothing
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
First
,
the
house
was
searched
by
the
pursuivant
and
his
gang
;
then
,
my
young
mistress
disappeared
;
then
it
was
rifled
by
these
plunderers
;
and
now
,
to
crown
all
,
it
is
on
fire
,
and
will
speedily
be
burnt
to
the
ground
.
""Say
<EOS>
not
so
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
"
The
flames
have
not
yet
reached
the
Hall
;
and
,
if
exertion
is
used
,
they
may
be
extinguished
without
further
mischief
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
those
who
have
kindled
them
extinguish
them
,
"
replied
Heydocke
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
raise
hand
more
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
are
the
incendiaries
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
pursuivant
and
his
myrmidons
,
"
replied
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"
They
came
here
to
-
night
;
and
after
ransacking
the
house
under
pretence
of
procuring
further
evidence
against
my
master
,
and
carrying
off
everything
valuable
they
could
collect
—
plate
,
jewels
,
ornaments
,
money
,
and
even
wearing-
<EOS>
apparel,—they
ended
by
locking
up
all
the
servants,—except
myself
,
who
managed
to
elude
their
vigilance,—in
the
cellar
,
and
setting
fire
to
the
stables
.
<EOS>
""Wretches
!
"
exclaimed
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Wretches
,
indeed
!
"
repeated
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
not
all
the
villany
they
contemplate
.
<EOS>
I
had
concealed
myself
in
the
store
-
room
,
under
a
heap
of
lumber
,
and
in
searching
for
me
they
chanced
upon
a
barrel
of
gunpowder—""Well
!
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
<EOS>
sir
,
"
pursued
Heydocke
,
"
<EOS>
I
heard
the
pursuivant
remark
to
one
of
his
comrades
,
'
This
is
a
lucky
discovery
.
<EOS>
If
we
ca
n't
find
the
steward
,
we
'll
blow
him
and
the
old
house
to
the
devil
.
'
<EOS>
Just
then
,
some
one
came
to
tell
him
I
was
hidden
in
the
stables
,
and
the
whole
troop
adjourned
thither
.
<EOS>
But
being
baulked
of
their
prey
,
I
suppose
,
they
wreaked
their
vengeance
in
the
way
you
perceive
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
But
they
shall
bitterly
rue
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
myself
represent
the
affair
to
the
Commissioners
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
useless
,
"
groaned
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
law
to
protect
the
property
of
a
Catholic
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
is
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
you
spoke
of
?
"
asked
Guy
Fawkes
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
villains
took
it
with
them
when
they
quitted
the
store
-
room
,
"
replied
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
they
have
got
it
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
""They
have
lighted
a
fire
which
shall
be
quenched
with
their
blood
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
Follow
me
.
<EOS>
I
may
need
you
both
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
darted
off
,
and
turning
the
corner
,
came
in
front
of
the
blazing
pile
.
<EOS>
Occupying
one
side
of
a
large
quadrangular
court
,
the
stables
were
wholly
disconnected
with
the
Hall
,
and
though
the
fire
burnt
furiously
,
yet
as
the
wind
carried
the
flames
and
sparks
in
a
contrary
direction
,
it
was
possible
the
latter
building
might
escape
if
due
precaution
were
taken
.
<EOS>
So
far
,
however
,
from
this
being
the
case
,
it
seemed
the
object
of
the
bystanders
to
assist
the
progress
of
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
Several
horses
,
saddled
and
bridled
,
had
been
removed
from
the
stable
,
and
placed
within
an
open
cowhouse
.
<EOS>
To
these
Guy
Fawkes
called
Chetham
's
attention
,
and
desired
him
and
the
old
steward
to
secure
some
of
them
.
<EOS>
Hastily
giving
directions
to
Heydocke
,
the
young
merchant
obeyed,—sprang
on
the
back
of
the
nearest
courser
,
and
seizing
the
bridles
of
two
others
,
rode
off
with
them
.
<EOS>
His
example
was
followed
by
Heydocke
,
and
one
steed
only
was
left
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
confusion
and
clamour
prevailing
around
,
that
the
above
proceeding
passed
unnoticed
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
,
meanwhile
,
ensconcing
himself
behind
the
court
-
gate
,
looked
about
for
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
could
discover
no
trace
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
beneath
a
shed
,
not
far
from
him
,
he
perceived
a
soldier
seated
upon
a
small
cask
,
which
he
had
no
doubt
<EOS>
was
the
object
he
was
in
search
of
.
<EOS>
So
intent
was
the
man
upon
the
spectacle
before
him
,
that
he
was
wholly
unaware
of
the
approach
of
an
enemy
;
and
creeping
noiselessly
up
to
him
,
Guy
Fawkes
felled
him
to
the
ground
with
a
blow
from
the
heavy
butt
-
end
of
his
petronel
.
<EOS>
The
action
was
not
perceived
by
the
others
;
and
carrying
the
cask
out
of
the
yard
,
Fawkes
burst
in
the
lid
,
and
ascertained
that
the
contents
were
what
they
had
been
represented
.
<EOS>
He
then
glanced
around
,
to
see
how
he
could
best
execute
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
On
the
top
of
the
wall
adjoining
the
stables
he
beheld
the
pursuivant
,
with
three
or
four
soldiers
,
giving
directions
and
issuing
orders
.
<EOS>
Another
and
lower
wall
,
forming
the
opposite
side
of
the
quadrangle
,
and
built
on
the
edge
of
the
moat
,
approached
the
scene
of
the
fire
,
and
on
this
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
with
the
barrel
of
gunpowder
on
his
shoulder
,
mounted
.
<EOS>
Concealing
himself
behind
a
tree
which
overshadowed
it
,
he
watched
a
favourable
moment
for
his
enterprise
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
to
wait
long
.
<EOS>
Prompted
by
some
undefinable
feeling
,
which
caused
him
to
rush
upon
his
destruction
,
the
pursuivant
ventured
upon
the
roof
of
the
stables
,
and
was
followed
by
his
companions
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
this
occur
,
than
Guy
Fawkes
dashed
forward
,
and
hurled
the
barrel
with
all
his
force
into
the
midst
of
the
flames
,
throwing
himself
at
the
same
moment
into
the
moat
.
<EOS>
The
explosion
was
instantaneous
and
tremendous;—so
loud
as
to
be
audible
even
under
the
water
.
<EOS>
Its
effects
were
terrible
.
<EOS>
The
bodies
of
the
pursuivant
and
his
companions
were
blown
into
the
air
,
and
carried
to
the
further
side
of
the
moat
.
<EOS>
Of
those
standing
before
the
building
,
several
were
destroyed
,
and
all
more
or
less
injured
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
thrown
down
by
the
concussion
,
and
the
roof
and
its
fiery
fragments
projected
into
the
moat
.
<EOS>
An
effectual
stop
was
put
to
the
conflagration
;
and
,
when
Guy
Fawkes
rose
to
the
boiling
and
agitated
surface
of
the
water
,
the
flames
were
entirely
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Hearing
groans
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
moat
,
he
forced
his
way
through
the
blazing
beams
,
which
were
hissing
near
him
;
and
snatching
up
a
still
burning
fragment
,
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
In
the
blackened
and
mutilated
object
that
met
his
gaze
,
he
recognised
the
pursuivant
.
<EOS>
The
dying
wretch
also
recognised
him
,
and
attempted
to
speak
;
but
in
vain
—
his
tongue
refused
its
office
,
and
with
a
horrible
attempt
at
articulation
,
he
expired
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
explosion
,
the
domestics,—who
it
has
already
been
mentioned
were
confined
in
the
cellar;—were
rendered
so
desperate
by
their
fears
,
that
they
contrived
to
break
out
of
their
prison
,
and
now
hastened
to
the
stables
to
ascertain
the
cause
of
the
report
.
<EOS>
Leaving
them
to
assist
the
sufferers
,
whose
dreadful
groans
awakened
some
feelings
of
compunction
in
his
iron
breast
,
Guy
Fawkes
caught
the
steed,—which
had
broken
its
bridle
and
rushed
off
,
and
now
stood
shivering
,
shaking
,
and
drenched
in
moisture
near
the
drawbridge,—and
,
mounting
it
,
galloped
towards
the
cave
.
<EOS>
At
its
entrance
,
he
was
met
by
Humphrey
Chetham
and
Oldcorne
,
who
eagerly
inquired
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
briefly
explained
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
hand
of
Heaven
manifested
by
your
arm
,
my
son
,
"
observed
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
Would
that
it
had
stricken
the
tyrant
and
apostate
prince
by
whom
our
church
is
persecuted
!
<EOS>
But
his
turn
will
speedily
arrive
.
<EOS>
""Peace
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
lament
the
fate
of
the
pursuivant
,
"
observed
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
a
frightful
waste
of
human
life
—
and
in
such
a
cause!""It
is
the
cause
of
Heaven
,
young
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
priest
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
think
so
,
"
returned
Chetham
;
"
and
,
but
for
my
devotion
to
Viviana
,
I
would
have
no
further
share
in
it
.
<EOS>
""You
are
at
liberty
to
leave
us
,
if
you
think
proper
,
"
retorted
the
priest
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
say
not
so
,
father
,
"
interposed
Viviana
,
who
had
been
an
unobserved
listener
to
the
foregoing
discourse
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
your
life
—
your
liberty
,
to
Mr.
Chetham
.
<EOS>
""True
,
daughter
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
too
hasty
,
and
entreat
his
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
it
,
reverend
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
young
merchant
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Master
Heydocke
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
steward
,
"
you
may
return
to
the
Hall
with
safety
.
<EOS>
No
one
will
molest
you
more
,
and
your
presence
may
be
needed
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
my
young
mistress
—
"
said
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"I
am
setting
out
for
Holywell
to
join
my
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
receive
our
instructions
from
that
place
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
,
"
returned
the
old
man
,
bowing
respectfully
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
shield
us
from
further
misfortune!"Humphrey
Chetham
having
assisted
Viviana
into
the
saddle
,
and
the
rest
of
the
party
having
mounted
,
they
took
the
road
to
Chester
,
while
Heydocke
returned
to
the
Hall

THE
PILGRIMAGE
TO

<EOS>
WINIFRED
'S
WELLEarly
on
the
following
morning
,
the
party
,
who
had
ridden
hard
,
and
had
paused
only
for
a
short
time
at
Knutsford
to
rest
their
steeds
,
approached
the
ancient
and
picturesque
city
of
Chester
.
<EOS>
Skirting
its
high
,
and
then
partly
fortified
walls
,
above
which
appeared
the
massive
tower
of
the
venerable
cathedral
,
they
passed
through
the
east
-
gate
,
and
proceeding
along
the
street
deriving
its
name
from
that
entrance
,
were
about
to
halt
before
the
door
of
a
large
hostel
,
called
the
Saint
Werburgh
's
Abbey
,
when
,
to
their
great
surprise
,
they
perceived
Catesby
riding
towards
them
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
I
could
not
be
mistaken
,
"
cried
the
latter
,
as
he
drew
near
and
saluted
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
about
to
set
out
for
Manchester
with
a
despatch
to
you
from
your
father
,
Miss
Radcliffe
,
when
this
most
unexpected
and
fortunate
encounter
spares
me
the
journey
.
<EOS>
But
may
I
ask
why
I
see
you
here
,
and
thus
attended
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
glancing
uneasily
at
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
from
Father
Oldcorne
explained
all
.
<EOS>
Catesby
affected
to
bend
his
brow
,
and
appear
concerned
at
the
relation
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
scarcely
repress
his
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
William
Radcliffe
must
join
us
now
,
"
he
whispered
to
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
must
—
he
shall
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
father
wishes
you
to
join
him
at
Holt
,
Miss
Radcliffe
,
"
remarked
Catesby
,
turning
to
her
,
"
whence
the
pilgrimage
starts
to
-
morrow
for
<EOS>
Saint
Winifred
's
Well
.
<EOS>
There
are
already
nearly
thirty
devout
persons
assembled
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
replied
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
May
I
inquire
their
names
.
<EOS>
""Sir
Everard
and
Lady
Digby
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
the
Lady
Anne
Vaux
and
her
sister
,
Mrs.
Brooksby
;
Mr.
Ambrose
Rookwood
and
his
wife
,
the
two
Winters
,
Tresham
,
Wright
,
Fathers
Garnet
and
Fisher
,
and
many
others
,
in
all
probability
unknown
to
you
.
<EOS>
The
procession
started
ten
days
ago
from
Gothurst
,
in
Buckinghamshire
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
's
residence
,
and
proceeded
from
thence
by
slow
stages
to
Norbrook
and
Haddington
,
at
each
of
which
houses
it
halted
for
some
days
.
<EOS>
Yesterday
,
it
reached
Holt
,
and
starts
,
as
I
have
just
told
you
,
to
-
morrow
for
Holywell
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
so
disposed
,
you
will
be
able
to
attend
it
.
<EOS>
""I
will
gladly
do
so
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
And
since
I
find
it
is
not
necessary
to
hurry
forward
,
I
will
rest
myself
for
a
short
time
here
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
dismounted
,
and
the
whole
party
entered
the
hostel
.
<EOS>
Viviana
withdrew
to
seek
a
short
repose
,
and
glance
over
her
father
's
letter
,
while
Catesby
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
Oldcorne
,
were
engaged
in
deep
consultation
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
,
perceiving
that
his
attendance
was
no
further
required
,
and
that
he
was
an
object
of
suspicion
and
dislike
to
Catesby,—for
whom
he
also
entertained
a
similar
aversion,—prepared
to
return
.
<EOS>
And
when
Viviana
made
her
appearance
,
he
advanced
to
bid
her
farewell
.
<EOS>
"I
can
be
of
no
further
service
to
you
,
Viviana
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
mournful
tone
;
"
and
as
my
presence
might
be
as
unwelcome
to
your
father
,
as
it
seems
to
be
to
others
of
your
friends
,
I
will
now
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
Mr.
Chetham
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
attempt
to
oppose
your
departure
;
for
,
much
as
I
grieve
to
lose
you
—
and
that
I
do
<EOS>
so
these
tears
will
testify,—I
feel
that
it
is
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
owe
you
much
—
more
—
far
more
than
I
can
ever
repay
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
unworthy
in
me
,
and
unfair
to
you
,
to
say
that
I
do
not
,
and
shall
not
ever
feel
the
deepest
interest
in
you
;
that
,
next
to
my
father
,
there
is
no
one
whom
I
regard
—
nay
,
whom
I
love
so
much
.
<EOS>
""Love
!
<EOS>
Viviana
?
<EOS>
"
echoed
the
young
merchant
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"Love
<EOS>
,
Mr.
Chetham
,
"
she
continued
,
turning
very
pale
;
"
since
you
compel
me
to
repeat
the
word
.
<EOS>
I
avow
it
boldly
,
because
—
"
and
her
voice
faltered,—"I
would
not
have
you
suppose
me
ungrateful
,
and
because
I
never
can
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
attempt
to
dissuade
you
from
the
fatal
determination
you
have
formed
of
burying
your
charms
in
a
cloister
,
"
rejoined
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
do
love
me
,
why
condemn
yourself
<EOS>
—
why
condemn
me
to
hopeless
misery?""I
will
tell
you
why
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
Because
you
are
not
of
my
faith
;
and
because
I
never
will
we
d
a
heretic
.
<EOS>
""I
am
answered
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Chetham
,
"
interposed
Oldcorne
,
who
had
approached
them
unperceived
;
"
it
is
in
your
power
to
change
Viviana
's
determination
.
""How
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
young
merchant
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"By
being
reconciled
to
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
will
remain
unaltered
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"And
,
if
Mr.
Chetham
would
consent
to
this
proposal
,
I
would
not
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Farewell
,
"
she
added
,
extending
her
hand
to
him
,
which
he
pressed
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
let
us
prolong
an
interview
so
painful
to
us
both
.
<EOS>
The
best
wish
I
can
desire
for
you
is
,
that
we
may
never
meet
again
.
<EOS>
"Without
<EOS>
another
word
,
and
without
hazarding
a
look
at
the
object
of
his
affections
,
Chetham
rushed
out
of
the
room
,
and
mounting
his
horse
,
rode
off
in
the
direction
of
Manchester
.
<EOS>
"Daughter
,
"
observed
Oldcorne
,
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
"
I
can
not
too
highly
approve
of
your
conduct
,
or
too
warmly
applaud
the
mastery
you
display
over
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
—
—
"
and
he
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
what
,
father
?
"
cried
Viviana
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
think
I
have
done
wrong
in
dismissing
him?""By
no
means
,
dear
daughter
,
"
replied
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
acted
most
discreetly
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
forgive
me
if
I
urge
you
—
nay
,
implore
you
not
to
take
the
veil
;
but
rather
to
bestow
your
hand
upon
some
Catholic
gentleman——""Such
as
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
interrupted
Viviana
,
glancing
in
the
direction
of
the
individual
she
mentioned
,
who
was
watching
them
narrowly
from
the
further
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
repeated
Oldcorne
,
affecting
not
to
notice
the
scornful
emphasis
laid
on
the
name
.
<EOS>
"
None
more
fitting
could
be
found
,
nor
more
worthy
of
you
.
<EOS>
Our
Church
has
not
a
more
zealous
servant
and
upholder
;
and
he
will
be
at
once
a
father
and
a
husband
to
you
.
<EOS>
Such
a
union
would
be
highly
profitable
to
our
religion
.
<EOS>
And
,
though
it
is
well
for
those
whose
hearts
are
burthened
with
affliction
,
and
who
are
unable
to
render
any
active
service
to
their
faith
,
to
retire
from
the
world
,
it
behoves
every
sister
of
the
Romish
Church
to
support
it
at
a
juncture
like
the
present
,
at
any
sacrifice
of
personal
feeling
.
<EOS>
""Urge
me
no
more
<EOS>
,
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
every
sacrifice
for
my
religion
,
consistent
with
principle
and
feeling
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
make
this
;
neither
am
<EOS>
I
required
to
make
it
.
<EOS>
And
I
beg
you
will
entreat
Mr.
Catesby
to
desist
from
further
importunity
.
"Oldcorne
<EOS>
bowed
and
retired
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
another
syllable
exchanged
between
them
prior
to
their
departure
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
old
bridge
over
the
Dee
,
then
defended
at
each
extremity
by
a
gate
and
tower
,
the
party
took
the
road
to
Holt
,
where
they
arrived
in
about
an
hour
.
<EOS>
The
recent
conversation
had
thrown
a
restraint
over
them
,
which
was
not
removed
during
the
journey
.
<EOS>
Habitually
taciturn
,
as
has
already
been
remarked
,
Guy
Fawkes
seemed
gloomier
and
more
thoughtful
than
ever
;
and
though
he
rode
by
the
side
of
Viviana
,
he
did
not
volunteer
a
remark
,
and
scarcely
appeared
conscious
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
Catesby
and
Oldcorne
kept
aloof
,
and
it
was
not
until
they
came
in
sight
of
the
little
town
which
formed
their
destination
that
the
former
galloped
forward
,
and
striking
into
the
path
on
the
right
,
begged
Viviana
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
A
turn
in
the
road
shortly
afterwards
showed
them
a
large
mansion
screened
by
a
grove
of
beech
-
trees
.
<EOS>
"That
is
the
house
to
which
we
are
going
,
"
observed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
,
they
approached
a
lodge
,
the
gates
of
which
being
opened
by
an
attendant
,
admitted
them
to
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Viviana
's
heart
throbbed
with
delight
at
the
anticipated
meeting
with
her
father
;
but
she
could
not
repress
a
feeling
of
anxiety
at
the
distressing
intelligence
she
had
to
impart
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
she
drew
near
the
house
she
perceived
him
walking
beneath
the
shade
of
the
trees
with
two
other
persons
;
and
quickening
her
pace
,
sprang
from
her
steed
,
and
almost
before
he
was
aware
of
it
was
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
I
see
you
here
so
unexpectedly
,
my
dear
child
?
"
cried
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
from
the
surprise
which
her
sudden
appearance
occasioned
him
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Catesby
only
left
this
morning
,
charged
with
a
letter
entreating
you
to
set
out
without
delay,—and
<EOS>
now
I
behold
you
.
<EOS>
What
has
happened?"Viviana
then
recounted
the
occurrences
of
the
last
few
days
.
<EOS>
"It
is
as
I
feared
,
"
replied
Sir
William
,
in
a
desponding
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Our
oppressors
will
never
cease
till
they
drive
us
to
desperation!""They
will
not
!
"
rejoined
a
voice
behind
him
.
"
<EOS>
Well
may
we
exclaim
with
the
prophet—'How
long
,
O
Lord
,
shall
I
cry
,
and
thou
wilt
not
hear
?
<EOS>
Shall
I
cry
out
to
thee
suffering
violence
,
and
thou
wilt
not
save
?
<EOS>
Why
hast
thou
showed
me
iniquity
and
grievance
,
to
see
rapine
and
injustice
before
me
?
<EOS>
Why
lookest
thou
upon
them
that
do
unjust
things
,
and
holdest
thy
peace
when
the
wicked
devoureth
the
man
that
is
more
just
than
himself?'"Viviana
looked
in
the
direction
of
the
speaker
and
beheld
a
man
in
a
priestly
garb
,
whose
countenance
struck
her
forcibly
.
<EOS>
He
was
rather
under
the
middle
height
,
of
a
slight
spare
figure
,
and
in
age
might
be
about
fifty
.
<EOS>
His
features
,
which
in
his
youth
must
have
been
pleasing
,
if
not
handsome
,
and
which
were
still
regular
,
were
pale
and
emaciated
;
but
his
eye
was
dark
,
and
of
unusual
brilliancy
.
<EOS>
A
single
glance
at
this
person
satisfied
her
it
was
Father
Garnet
,
the
provincial
of
the
English
Jesuits
;
nor
was
she
mistaken
in
her
supposition
.
<EOS>
Of
this
remarkable
person
,
so
intimately
connected
with
the
main
events
of
the
history
about
to
be
related
,
it
may
be
proper
to
offer
some
preliminary
account
.
<EOS>
Born
at
Nottingham
in
1554
,
in
the
reign
of
Queen
Mary
,
and
of
obscure
parentage
,
Henry
Garnet
was
originally
destined
to
the
Protestant
Church
,
and
educated
,
with
a
view
to
taking
orders
,
at
Winchester
school
,
whence
<EOS>
it
was
intended
he
should
be
removed
in
due
course
to
Oxford
.
<EOS>
But
this
design
was
never
carried
into
effect
.
<EOS>
Influenced
by
motives
,
into
which
it
is
now
scarcely
worth
while
inquiring
,
and
which
have
been
contested
by
writers
on
both
sides
of
the
question
,
Garnet
proceeded
from
Winchester
to
London
,
where
he
engaged
himself
as
corrector
of
the
press
to
a
printer
of
law
-
books
,
named
Tottel
,
in
which
capacity
he
became
acquainted
with
Sir
Edward
Coke
and
Chief
Justice
Popham,—one
of
whom
was
afterwards
to
be
the
leading
counsel
against
him
,
and
the
other
his
judge
.
<EOS>
After
continuing
in
this
employment
for
two
years
,
during
which
he
had
meditated
a
change
in
his
religion
,
he
went
abroad
,
and
travelling
first
to
Madrid
,
and
then
to
Rome
,
saw
enough
of
the
Catholic
priesthood
to
confirm
his
resolution
,
and
in
1575
he
assumed
the
habit
of
a
Jesuit
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
his
studies
with
the
utmost
zeal
and
ardour
at
the
Jesuits
'
College
,
under
the
celebrated
Bellarmine
,
and
the
no
less
celebrated
Clavius
,
he
made
such
progress
,
that
upon
the
indisposition
of
the
latter
,
he
was
able
to
fill
the
mathematical
chair
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
less
skilled
in
philosophy
,
metaphysics
,
and
divinity
;
and
his
knowledge
of
Hebrew
was
so
profound
that
he
taught
it
publicly
in
the
Roman
schools
.
<EOS>
To
an
enthusiastic
zeal
in
the
cause
of
the
religion
he
had
espoused
,
Garnet
added
great
powers
of
persuasion
and
eloquence,—a
combination
of
qualities
well
fitting
him
for
the
office
of
a
missionary
priest
;
and
undismayed
by
the
dangers
he
would
have
to
encounter
,
and
eager
to
propagate
his
doctrines
,
he
solicited
to
be
sent
on
this
errand
to
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
At
the
instance
of
Father
Persons
,
he
received
an
appointment
to
the
mission
in
1586
,
and
he
secretly
landed
in
England
in
the
same
year
.
<EOS>
Braving
every
danger
,
and
shrinking
from
no
labour
,
he
sought
on
all
hands
to
make
proselytes
to
the
ancient
faith
,
and
to
sustain
the
wavering
courage
of
its
professors
.
<EOS>
Two
years
afterwards
,
on
the
imprisonment
of
the
Superior
of
the
Jesuits
,
being
raised
to
that
important
post
,
he
was
enabled
to
extend
his
sphere
of
action
;
and
redoubling
his
exertions
in
consequence
,
he
so
well
discharged
his
duties
,
that
it
was
mainly
owing
to
him
that
the
Catholic
party
was
kept
together
during
the
fierce
persecutions
of
the
latter
end
of
Elizabeth
's
reign
.
<EOS>
Compelled
to
personate
various
characters
,
as
he
travelled
from
place
to
place
,
Garnet
had
acquired
a
remarkable
facility
for
disguise
;
and
such
was
his
address
and
courage
,
that
he
not
unfrequently
imposed
upon
the
very
officers
sent
in
pursuit
of
him
.
<EOS>
Up
to
the
period
of
Elizabeth
's
demise
,
he
had
escaped
arrest
;
and
,
though
involved
in
the
treasonable
intrigue
with
the
king
of
Spain
,
and
other
conspiracies
,
he
procured
a
general
pardon
under
the
great
seal
.
<EOS>
His
office
and
profession
naturally
brought
him
into
contact
with
the
chief
Catholic
families
throughout
the
kingdom
;
and
he
maintained
an
active
correspondence
with
many
of
them
,
by
means
of
his
various
agents
and
emissaries
.
<EOS>
The
great
object
of
his
life
being
the
restoration
of
the
fallen
religion
,
to
accomplish
this
,
as
he
conceived
,
great
and
desirable
end
,
he
was
prepared
to
adopt
any
means
,
however
violent
or
obnoxious
.
<EOS>
When
,
under
the
seal
of
confession
,
Catesby
revealed
to
him
his
dark
designs
,
so
far
from
discouraging
him
,
all
he
counselled
was
caution
.
<EOS>
Having
tested
the
disposition
of
the
wealthier
Romanists
to
rise
against
their
oppressors
,
and
finding
a
general
insurrection
,
as
has
before
been
stated
,
impracticable
,
he
gave
every
encouragement
and
assistance
to
the
conspiracy
forming
among
the
more
desperate
and
discontented
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
At
his
instigation
,
the
present
pilgrimage
to
Saint
Winifred
's
Well
was
undertaken
,
in
the
hope
that
,
when
so
large
a
body
of
the
Catholics
were
collected
together
,
some
additional
aid
to
the
project
might
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
mysterious
and
inexplicable
portions
of
Garnet
's
history
is
that
relating
to
Anne
Vaux
.
<EOS>
This
lady
,
the
daughter
of
Lord
Vaux
of
Harrowden
,
a
rigid
Catholic
nobleman
,
and
one
of
Garnet
's
earliest
patrons
and
friends
,
on
the
death
of
her
father
,
in
1595
,
attached
herself
to
his
fortunes,—accompanied
him
in
all
his
missions,—shared
all
his
privations
and
dangers,—and
,
regardless
of
calumny
or
reproach
,
devoted
herself
entirely
to
his
service
.
<EOS>
What
is
not
less
singular
,
her
sister
,
who
had
married
a
Catholic
gentleman
named
Brooksby
,
became
his
equally
zealous
attendant
.
<EOS>
Their
enthusiasm
produced
a
similar
effect
on
Mr.
Brooksby
;
and
wherever
Garnet
went
,
all
three
accompanied
him
.
<EOS>
By
his
side
,
on
the
present
occasion
,
stood
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
Accounted
one
of
the
handsomest
,
most
accomplished
,
and
best
-
informed
men
of
his
time
,
Sir
Everard
,
at
the
period
of
this
history
only
twenty
-
four
,
had
married
,
when
scarcely
sixteen
,
Maria
,
heiress
of
the
ancient
and
honourable
family
of
Mulshoe
,
with
whom
he
obtained
a
large
fortune
,
and
the
magnificent
estate
of
Gothurst
,
or
Gaythurst
,
in
Buckinghamshire
.
<EOS>
Knighted
by
James
the
First
at
Belvoir
Castle
,
on
his
way
from
Scotland
to
London
,
Digby
,
who
had
once
formed
one
of
the
most
brilliant
ornaments
of
the
court
,
had
of
late
in
a
great
degree
retired
from
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
,
"
writes
Father
Greenway
,
"
that
he
had
dwelt
much
in
the
Queen
's
court
,
and
was
in
the
way
of
obtaining
honours
and
distinction
by
his
graceful
manners
and
rare
parts
,
he
chose
rather
to
bear
the
cross
with
the
persecuted
Catholics
,
et
vivere
abjectus
in
domo
Domini
,
than
to
sail
through
the
pleasures
of
a
palace
and
the
prosperities
of
the
world
,
to
the
shipwreck
of
his
conscience
and
the
destruction
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Having
only
when
he
completed
his
minority
professed
the
Catholic
religion
,
he
became
deeply
concerned
at
its
fallen
state
,
and
his
whole
thoughts
were
bent
upon
its
restoration
.
<EOS>
This
change
in
feeling
was
occasioned
chiefly
,
if
not
altogether
,
by
Garnet
,
by
whom
his
conversion
had
been
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Digby
was
richly
attired
in
a
black
velvet
doublet
,
with
sleeves
slashed
with
white
satin
,
and
wore
a
short
mantle
of
the
same
material
,
similarly
lined
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
enormous
trunk
hose
,
heretofore
mentioned
as
the
distinguishing
peculiarity
of
the
costume
of
the
period
,
and
wore
black
velvet
shoes
,
ornamented
with
white
roses
.
<EOS>
An
ample
ruff
encircled
his
throat
.
<EOS>
His
hat
was
steeple
-
crowned
,
and
somewhat
broader
in
the
leaf
than
was
ordinarily
worn
,
and
shaded
with
a
plume
of
black
feathers
.
<EOS>
His
hair
was
raven
black
,
and
he
wore
a
pointed
beard
,
and
moustaches
.
<EOS>
His
figure
was
tall
and
stately
,
and
his
features
grave
and
finely
formed
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
group
had
been
joined
by
the
others
,
and
a
friendly
greeting
took
place
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
presented
by
Catesby
to
Sir
William
Radcliffe
and
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
To
Garnet
he
required
no
introduction
,
and
Father
Oldcorne
was
known
to
all
.
<EOS>
After
a
little
further
conversation
,
the
party
adjourned
to
the
house
,
which
belonged
to
a
Welsh
Catholic
gentleman
,
named
Griffiths
,
who
,
though
absent
at
the
time
,
had
surrendered
it
to
the
use
of
Sir
Everard
Digby
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
On
their
entrance
,
Viviana
was
introduced
by
her
father
to
Lady
Digby
,
who
presided
as
hostess
,
and
welcomed
her
with
great
cordiality
.
<EOS>
She
was
then
conducted
to
her
own
room
,
where
she
was
speedily
joined
by
Sir
William
;
and
they
remained
closeted
together
till
summoned
to
the
principal
meal
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
At
the
table
,
which
was
most
hospitably
served
,
Viviana
found
,
in
addition
to
her
former
companions
,
a
large
assemblage
,
to
most
of
whom
<EOS>
she
was
a
stranger
,
consisting
of
Anne
Vaux
,
Mr.
Brooksby
and
his
wife
,
Ambrose
Rookwood
,
two
brothers
named
Winter
,
two
Wrights
,
Francis
Tresham,—persons
of
whom
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
particular
mention
hereafter,—and
<EOS>
several
others
,
in
all
amounting
to
thirty
.
<EOS>
The
meal
over
,
the
company
dispersed
,
and
Viviana
and
her
father
,
passing
through
an
open
window
,
wandered
forth
upon
a
beautiful
and
spreading
lawn
,
and
thence
under
the
shade
of
the
beech
-
trees
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
been
long
here
,
anxiously
conferring
on
recent
events
,
when
they
perceived
Garnet
and
Catesby
approaching
.
"Father
,
dear
father
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
hastily
,
"
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
warn
you
;
but
I
have
not
time
to
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
Some
dark
and
dangerous
plot
is
in
agitation
to
restore
our
religion
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Catesby
is
anxious
to
league
you
with
it
.
<EOS>
Do
not
—
do
not
yield
to
his
solicitations!""Fear
nothing
on
that
score
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
Sir
William
,
"
I
have
already
perplexities
enow
,
without
adding
to
them
.
<EOS>
""I
will
leave
you
,
then
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
soon
as
the
others
came
up
,
she
made
some
excuse
for
withdrawing
,
and
returned
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
window
of
her
chamber
commanded
the
avenue
,
and
from
it
she
watched
the
group
.
<EOS>
They
remained
for
a
long
time
pacing
up
and
down
,
in
earnest
conversation
.
<EOS>
By
and
by
,
they
were
joined
by
Oldcorne
and
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Then
came
a
third
party
,
consisting
of
the
Winters
and
Wrights
;
and
,
lastly
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
and
Tresham
swelled
the
list
.
<EOS>
The
assemblage
was
then
harangued
by
Catesby
,
and
the
most
profound
attention
paid
to
his
address
.
<EOS>
Viviana
kept
her
eye
fixed
upon
her
father
's
countenance
,
and
from
its
changing
expression
inferred
what
effect
the
speech
produced
upon
him
.
<EOS>
At
its
conclusion
,
the
assemblage
separated
in
little
groups
;
and
she
perceived
,
with
great
uneasiness
,
that
Father
Garnet
passed
his
arm
through
that
of
her
father
,
and
led
him
away
.
<EOS>
Some
time
elapsed
,
and
neither
of
them
re
-
appeared
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
warning
was
in
vain
;
he
has
joined
them
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"No
,
Viviana
!
"
cried
her
father
's
voice
behind
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
not
joined
them
.
<EOS>
Nor
shall
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
flinging
her
arms
around
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
were
aware
that
they
were
overheard
by
Garnet
,
who
had
noiselessly
followed
Sir
William
into
the
room
,
and
muttered
to
himself
,
"
<EOS>
For
all
this
,
he
shall
join
the
plot
,
and
she
shall
we
d
Catesby
.
"He
<EOS>
then
coughed
slightly
,
to
announce
his
presence
;
and
,
apologizing
to
Viviana
for
the
intrusion
,
told
her
he
came
to
confess
her
previously
to
the
celebration
of
mass
,
which
would
take
place
that
evening
,
in
a
small
chapel
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Wholly
obedient
to
the
command
of
her
spiritual
advisers
,
Viviana
instantly
signified
her
assent
;
and
,
her
father
having
withdrawn
,
she
laid
open
the
inmost
secrets
of
her
heart
to
the
Jesuit
.
<EOS>
Severely
reprobating
her
love
for
a
heretic
,
before
he
would
give
her
absolution
,
Garnet
enjoined
her
,
as
a
penance
,
to
walk
barefoot
to
the
holy
well
on
the
morrow
,
and
to
make
a
costly
offering
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
.
<EOS>
Compliance
being
promised
to
his
injunction
,
he
pronounced
the
absolution
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
mass
was
celebrated
by
Garnet
,
and
the
sacrament
administered
to
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
An
hour
before
daybreak
,
the
party
again
assembled
in
the
chapel
,
where
matins
were
performed
;
after
which
,
the
female
devotees
,
who
were
clothed
in
snow
-
white
woollen
robes
,
with
wide
sleeves
and
hoods
,
and
having
large
black
crosses
woven
in
front
,
retired
for
a
short
time
,
and
re
-
appeared
,
with
their
feet
bared
,
and
hair
unbound
.
<EOS>
Each
had
a
large
rosary
attached
to
the
cord
that
bound
her
waist
.
<EOS>
Catesby
thought
Viviana
had
never
appeared
so
lovely
as
in
this
costume
;
and
as
he
gazed
at
her
white
and
delicately
formed
feet
,
her
small
rounded
ankles
,
her
dark
and
abundant
tresses
falling
in
showers
almost
to
the
ground
,
he
became
more
deeply
enamoured
than
before
.
<EOS>
His
passionate
gaze
was
,
however
,
unnoticed
,
as
the
object
of
it
kept
her
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Lady
Digby
,
who
was
a
most
beautiful
woman
,
scarcely
appeared
to
less
advantage
;
and
,
as
she
walked
side
by
side
with
Viviana
in
the
procession
,
the
pair
attracted
universal
admiration
from
all
who
beheld
them
.
<EOS>
Everything
being
at
last
in
readiness
,
and
the
order
of
march
fully
arranged
,
two
youthful
choristers
,
in
surplices
,
chanting
a
hymn
to
Saint
Winifred
,
set
forth
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
two
men
bearing
silken
banners
,
on
one
of
which
was
displayed
the
martyrdom
of
the
saint
whose
shrine
they
were
about
to
visit
,
and
on
the
other
a
lamb
carrying
a
cross
;
next
came
Fathers
Oldcorne
and
Fisher
,
each
sustaining
a
large
silver
crucifix
;
next
,
Garnet
alone
,
in
the
full
habit
of
his
order
;
next
,
the
females
,
in
the
attire
before
described
,
and
walking
two
and
two
;
next
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
and
Sir
William
Radcliffe
;
and
lastly
,
the
rest
of
the
pilgrims
,
to
the
number
of
fourteen
.
<EOS>
These
were
all
on
foot
.
<EOS>
But
at
the
distance
of
fifty
paces
behind
them
rode
Guy
Fawkes
and
Catesby
,
at
the
head
of
twenty
well
-
armed
and
well
-
mounted
attendants
,
intended
to
serve
as
a
guard
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
In
such
order
,
this
singular
procession
moved
forward
at
a
slow
pace
,
taking
its
course
along
a
secluded
road
leading
to
the
ridge
of
hills
extending
from
the
neighbourhood
of
Wrexham
to
Mold
,
and
from
thence
,
in
an
almost
unbroken
chain
,
to
Holywell
.
<EOS>
Along
these
heights
,
whence
magnificent
views
were
obtained
of
the
broad
estuary
of
the
Dee
and
the
more
distant
ocean
,
the
train
proceeded
without
interruption
;
and
though
the
road
selected
was
one
seldom
traversed
,
and
through
a
country
thinly
peopled
,
still
,
the
rumour
of
the
pilgrimage
having
gone
abroad
,
hundreds
were
stationed
at
different
points
to
behold
it
.
<EOS>
Some
expressions
of
disapprobation
were
occasionally
manifested
by
the
spectators
;
but
the
presence
of
the
large
armed
force
effectually
prevented
any
interference
.
<EOS>
Whenever
such
a
course
could
be
pursued
,
the
procession
took
its
way
over
the
sward
.
<EOS>
Still
the
sufferings
of
the
females
were
severe
in
the
extreme
;
and
before
Viviana
had
proceeded
a
mile
,
her
white
,
tender
feet
were
cut
and
bruised
by
the
sharp
flints
over
which
she
walked
;
every
step
she
took
leaving
a
bloody
print
behind
it
.
<EOS>
Lady
Digby
was
in
little
better
condition
.
<EOS>
But
such
was
the
zeal
by
which
they
,
in
common
with
all
the
other
devotees
following
them
,
were
animated
,
that
not
a
single
murmur
was
uttered
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
in
this
way
,
they
reached
at
mid
-
day
a
small
stone
chapel
on
the
summit
of
the
hill
overlooking
Plas
-
Newydd
,
where
they
halted
,
and
devotions
being
performed
,
the
females
bathed
their
lacerated
limbs
in
a
neighbouring
brook
,
after
which
they
were
rubbed
with
a
cooling
and
odorous
ointment
.
<EOS>
Thus
refreshed
,
they
again
set
forward
,
and
halting
a
second
time
at
Plas
-
Isaf
,
where
similar
religious
ceremonies
were
observed
,
they
rested
for
the
day
at
a
lodging
prepared
for
their
reception
in
the
vicinity
of
Mold
.
<EOS>
The
night
being
passed
in
prayer
,
early
in
the
morning
they
commenced
their
march
in
the
same
order
as
before
.
<EOS>
When
Viviana
first
set
her
feet
to
the
ground
,
she
felt
as
if
she
were
treading
on
hot
iron
,
and
the
pain
was
so
excruciating
,
that
she
could
not
repress
a
cry
.
<EOS>
"Heed
<EOS>
not
your
sufferings
,
dear
daughter
,
"
observed
Garnet
,
compassionately
;
"
the
waters
of
the
holy
fountain
will
heal
the
wounds
both
of
soul
and
body
.
<EOS>
"Overcoming
<EOS>
her
agony
by
a
powerful
effort
<EOS>
,
she
contrived
to
limp
forward
;
and
the
whole
party
was
soon
after
in
motion
.
<EOS>
Halting
;
for
two
hours
at
Pentre
-
Terfyn
,
and
again
at
Skeviog
,
the
train
,
towards
evening
,
reached
the
summit
of
the
hill
overlooking
Holywell
,
at
the
foot
of
which
could
be
seen
the
ruins
of
Basingwerk
Abbey
,
and
the
roof
of
the
ancient
chapel
erected
over
the
sacred
spring
.
<EOS>
At
this
sight
,
those
who
were
foremost
in
the
procession
fell
on
their
knees
;
and
the
horsemen
dismounting
,
imitated
their
example
.
<EOS>
An
earnest
supplication
to
Saint
Winifred
was
then
poured
forth
by
Father
Garnet
,
in
which
all
the
others
joined
,
and
a
hymn
in
her
honour
chanted
by
the
choristers
.
<EOS>
Their
devotions
ended
,
the
whole
train
arose
,
and
walked
slowly
down
the
steep
descent
.
<EOS>
As
they
entered
the
little
town
,
which
owes
its
name
and
celebrity
to
the
miraculous
spring
rising
within
it
,
they
were
met
by
a
large
concourse
of
people
,
who
had
flocked
from
Flint
,
and
the
other
neighbouring
places
to
witness
the
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
inhabitants
of
Holywell
,
holding
their
saintly
patroness
in
the
deepest
veneration
,
viewed
this
pilgrimage
to
her
shrine
as
a
proper
tribute
of
respect
,
while
those
of
the
opposite
faith
were
greatly
impressed
by
it
.
<EOS>
As
the
procession
advanced
,
the
crowd
divided
into
two
lines
to
allow
it
passage
,
and
many
fell
on
their
knees
imploring
a
blessing
from
Garnet
,
which
he
in
no
instance
refused
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
sacred
well
,
they
were
met
by
a
priest
,
followed
by
another
small
train
of
pilgrims
.
<EOS>
A
Latin
oration
having
been
pronounced
by
this
priest
,
and
replied
to
in
the
same
language
by
Garnet
,
the
train
was
once
more
put
in
motion
,
and
presently
reached
the
ancient
fabric
built
over
the
sacred
fountain
.
<EOS>
The
legend
of
Saint
Winifred
is
so
well
known
,
that
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
repeat
it
.
<EOS>
For
the
benefit
of
the
uninformed
,
however
,
it
may
be
stated
that
she
flourished
about
the
middle
of
the
seventh
century
,
and
was
the
daughter
of
Thewith
,
one
of
the
chief
lords
of
Wales
.
<EOS>
Devoutly
educated
by
a
monk
named
Beuno
,
who
afterwards
received
canonization
,
she
took
the
veil
,
and
retired
to
a
small
monastery
(
the
ruins
of
which
still
exist
)
,
built
by
her
father
near
the
scene
of
her
subsequent
martyrdom
.
<EOS>
Persecuted
by
the
addresses
of
Caradoc
,
son
of
Alan
,
Prince
of
Wales
,
she
fled
from
him
to
avoid
his
violence
.
<EOS>
He
followed
,
and
inflamed
by
fury
at
her
resistance
,
struck
off
her
head
.
<EOS>
For
this
atrocity
,
the
earth
instantly
opened
and
swallowed
him
alive
,
while
from
the
spot
where
the
head
had
fallen
gushed
forth
a
fountain
of
unequalled
force
and
purity
,
producing
more
than
a
hundred
tons
a
minute
.
<EOS>
The
bottom
of
this
miraculous
well
is
strewn
with
pebbles
streaked
with
red
veins
,
in
memory
of
the
virgin
saint
from
whose
blood
it
sprung
.
<EOS>
On
its
margin
grows
an
odorous
moss
,
while
its
gelid
and
translucent
waters
are
esteemed
a
remedy
for
many
disorders
.
<EOS>
Winifred
's
career
did
not
terminate
with
her
decapitation
.
<EOS>
Resuscitated
by
the
prayers
of
Saint
Beuno
,
she
lived
many
years
a
life
of
the
utmost
sanctity
,
bearing
,
as
a
mark
of
the
miracle
performed
in
her
behalf
,
a
narrow
crimson
circle
round
her
throat
.
<EOS>
Passing
the
chapel
adjoining
the
well
,
built
in
the
reign
of
Henry
the
Seventh
by
his
mother
,
the
pious
Countess
of
Richmond
,
the
pilgrims
came
to
the
swift
clear
stream
rushing
from
the
well
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
ascending
the
steps
leading
to
the
edifice
built
over
the
spring
,
they
plunged
into
the
stream
,
and
crossing
it
entered
the
structure
by
a
doorway
on
the
further
side
.
<EOS>
Erected
by
the
Countess
of
Richmond
at
the
same
period
as
the
chapel
,
this
structure
,
quadrangular
in
form
,
and
of
great
beauty
,
consists
of
light
clustered
pillars
and
mouldings
,
supporting
the
most
gorgeous
tracery
and
groining
,
the
whole
being
ornamented
with
sculptured
bosses
,
pendent
capitals
,
fretwork
,
niches
,
and
tabernacles
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
is
a
large
stone
basin
,
to
receive
the
water
of
the
fountain
,
around
which
the
procession
now
grouped
,
and
as
soon
as
all
were
assembled
,
at
the
command
of
Father
Garnet
they
fell
on
their
knees
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
solemn
and
striking
sight
to
see
this
large
group
prostrated
around
that
beautiful
fountain
,
and
covered
by
that
ancient
structure,—a
touching
thing
to
hear
the
voice
of
prayer
mingling
with
the
sound
of
the
rushing
water
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
they
all
arose
.
<EOS>
A
hymn
was
then
chanted
,
and
votive
offerings
made
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
.
<EOS>
The
male
portion
of
the
assemblage
then
followed
Garnet
to
the
chapel
,
where
further
religious
rites
were
performed
,
while
the
female
devotees
,
remaining
near
the
fountain
,
resigned
themselves
to
the
care
of
several
attendants
of
their
own
sex
,
who
,
having
bathed
their
feet
in
the
water
,
applied
some
of
the
fragrant
moss
above
described
to
the
wounds
;
and
,
such
was
the
faith
of
the
patients
,
or
the
virtue
of
the
application
,
that
in
a
short
time
they
all
felt
perfectly
restored
,
and
able
to
join
their
companions
in
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
evening
was
spent
,
and
it
was
not
until
late
that
they
finished
their
devotions
,
and
departed
to
the
lodgings
provided
for
them
in
the
town
.
<EOS>
Impressed
with
a
strange
superstitious
feeling
,
which
he
could
scarcely
acknowledge
to
himself
,
Guy
Fawkes
determined
to
pass
the
night
near
the
well
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
without
communicating
his
intention
to
his
companions
,
he
threw
a
small
knapsack
over
his
shoulder
,
containing
a
change
of
linen
,
and
a
few
articles
of
attire
,
and
proceeded
thither
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
brilliant
moonlight
night
,
and
,
as
the
radiance
,
streaming
through
the
thin
clustered
columns
of
the
structure
,
lighted
up
its
fairy
architecture
,
and
fell
upon
the
clear
cold
waves
of
the
fountain
,
revealing
the
blood
-
streaked
pebbles
beneath
,
the
effect
was
inexpressibly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
So
charmed
was
Guy
Fawkes
by
the
sight
,
that
he
remained
for
some
time
standing
near
the
edge
of
the
basin
,
as
if
fascinated
by
the
marvellous
spring
that
boiled
up
and
sparkled
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Resolved
to
try
the
efficacy
of
the
bath
,
he
threw
off
his
clothes
and
plunged
into
it
.
<EOS>
The
water
was
cold
as
ice
;
but
on
emerging
from
it
he
felt
wonderfully
refreshed
.
<EOS>
Having
dressed
himself
,
he
wrapped
his
cloak
around
him
,
and
,
throwing
himself
on
the
stone
floor
,
placed
the
knapsack
under
his
head
,
and
grasping
a
petronel
in
his
right
hand
,
to
be
ready
in
case
of
a
surprise
,
disposed
himself
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
IllustrationAccustomed
to
a
soldier
's
couch
,
he
soon
fell
asleep
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
long
closed
his
eyes
when
he
dreamed
that
from
out
of
the
well
a
female
figure
,
slight
and
unsubstantial
as
the
element
from
which
it
sprang
,
arose
.
<EOS>
It
was
robed
in
what
resembled
a
nun
's
garb
;
but
so
thin
and
vapoury
,
that
the
very
moonlight
shone
through
it
.
<EOS>
From
the
garments
of
the
figure
,
as
well
as
from
the
crimson
circle
round
its
throat
,
he
knew
that
it
must
be
the
patroness
of
the
place
,
the
sainted
Winifred
,
that
he
beheld
.
<EOS>
He
felt
no
horror
,
but
the
deepest
awe
.
<EOS>
The
arm
of
the
figure
was
raised,—its
benignant
regards
fixed
upon
him,—and
,
as
soon
as
it
gained
the
level
of
the
basin
,
it
glided
towards
him
.

—
THE
VISIONBefore
daybreak
on
the
following
morning
,
Garnet
,
who
had
been
engaged
in
earnest
conference
with
Catesby
during
the
whole
of
the
night
,
<EOS>
repaired
to
the
sacred
spring
for
the
purpose
of
bathing
within
it
,
and
performing
his
solitary
devotions
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
.
<EOS>
On
ascending
the
steps
of
the
structure
,
he
perceived
Guy
Fawkes
kneeling
beside
the
fountain
,
apparently
occupied
in
prayer
;
and
,
being
unwilling
to
disturb
him
,
he
paused
.
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
that
he
did
not
move
,
he
advanced
towards
him
,
and
was
about
to
lay
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
very
extraordinary
expression
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
lips
were
partly
open
,
but
perfectly
motionless
,
and
his
eyes
,
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
,
were
fixed
upon
the
boiling
waters
of
the
spring
.
<EOS>
His
hands
were
clasped
,
and
his
look
altogether
was
that
of
one
whose
faculties
were
benumbed
by
awe
or
terror
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
fanatical
and
enthusiastical
character
of
Fawkes
,
Garnet
had
little
doubt
that
,
by
keeping
long
vigil
at
the
fountain
,
he
had
worked
himself
into
such
a
state
of
over
-
excitement
as
to
imagine
he
beheld
some
preternatural
appearance
;
and
it
was
with
some
curiosity
that
he
awaited
the
result
.
<EOS>
Glancing
in
the
same
direction
,
his
eye
rested
upon
the
bottom
of
the
well
,
but
he
could
discern
nothing
except
the
glittering
and
blood
-
streaked
pebbles
,
and
the
reflection
of
the
early
sunbeams
that
quivered
on
its
steaming
surface
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
a
convulsion
passed
over
the
frame
of
the
kneeler
,
and
heaving
a
deep
sigh
he
arose
.
<EOS>
Turning
to
quit
the
spring
,
he
confronted
Garnet
,
and
demanded
,
in
<EOS>
a
low
voice—"Have
<EOS>
you
likewise
seen
the
vision
,
father?"Garnet
made
no
reply
,
but
regarded
him
steadfastly
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
the
blessed
Winifred
appeared
to
you
,
I
say
?
"
continued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
answered
Garnet
;
"
I
am
but
just
come
hither
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
you
,
my
son,—the
favoured
of
Heaven,—for
whom
such
glorious
visions
are
reserved
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nothing
.
<EOS>
How
did
the
saint
manifest
herself
to
you?""In
her
earthly
form
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
or
rather
,
I
should
say
,
in
the
semblance
of
the
form
she
bore
on
earth
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
father
.
<EOS>
I
came
hither
last
night
to
make
my
couch
beside
the
fountain
.
<EOS>
After
plunging
into
it
,
I
felt
marvellously
refreshed
,
and
disposed
myself
to
rest
on
that
stone
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
had
my
eyes
closed
when
the
saintly
virgin
appeared
to
me
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
father
,
it
was
a
vision
of
seraphic
beauty
,
such
as
the
eye
of
man
hath
seldom
<EOS>
seen!""And
such
only
as
it
is
permitted
the
elect
of
Heaven
to
see
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
father
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
I
can
lay
little
claim
to
such
an
epithet
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
begin
to
fear
that
I
have
incurred
the
displeasure
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
not
so
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
uneasily
.
"
<EOS>
Relate
your
vision
,
and
I
will
interpret
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Thus
<EOS>
then
it
was
,
father
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
The
figure
of
the
saint
arose
from
out
the
well
,
and
gliding
towards
me
laid
its
finger
upon
my
brow
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
opened
,
but
I
was
as
one
oppressed
with
a
nightmare
,
unable
to
move
.
<EOS>
I
then
thought
I
heard
my
name
pronounced
by
a
voice
so
wondrously
sweet
that
my
senses
were
quite
ravished
.
<EOS>
Fain
would
I
have
prostrated
myself
,
but
my
limbs
refused
their
office
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
I
speak
,
for
my
tongue
was
also
enchained
.
<EOS>
""Proceed
,
my
son
,
"
observed
Garnet
;
"
I
am
curious
to
know
what
ensued
.
<EOS>
""Father
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
if
the
form
I
beheld
was
that
of
Saint
Winifred,—and
that
it
was
so
,
<EOS>
I
can
not
doubt,—the
enterprise
on
which
we
are
engaged
will
fail
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
approved
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
The
vision
warned
me
to
desist
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
desist
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Your
oath
binds
you
to
the
project
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
and
I
have
no
thought
of
abandoning
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
well
assured
it
will
not
be
successful
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
thinking
so
,
my
son
,
will
be
the
most
certain
means
of
realizing
your
apprehensions
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
gravely
.
"
<EOS>
But
let
me
hear
the
exact
words
of
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
You
may
have
misunderstood
them
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
repeat
them
precisely
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
but
I
could
not
misapprehend
their
import
,
which
was
the
deepest
commiseration
for
our
forlorn
and
fallen
church
,
but
a
positive
interdiction
against
any
attempt
to
restore
it
by
bloodshed
.
'
<EOS>
Suffer
on
,
'
said
the
spirit
;
'
bear
the
yoke
patiently
,
and
in
due
season
God
will
avenge
your
wrongs
,
and
free
you
from
oppression
.
<EOS>
You
are
thus
afflicted
that
your
faith
may
be
purified
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
resort
to
violence
,
you
will
breed
confusion
,
and
injure
,
not
serve
,
the
holy
cause
on
which
you
are
embarked
.
'
<EOS>
Such
,
father
,
was
the
language
of
the
saint
.
<EOS>
It
was
uttered
in
a
tone
so
tender
and
sympathizing
,
that
every
word
found
an
echo
in
my
heart
,
and
I
repented
having
pledged
myself
to
the
undertaking
.
<EOS>
But
,
when
I
tell
you
that
she
added
that
all
concerned
in
the
conspiracy
should
perish
,
perhaps
you
may
be
deterred
from
proceeding
further
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
suffer
any
one
engaged
in
it
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
What
matter
if
a
few
perish
,
if
the
many
survive
?
<EOS>
Our
blood
will
not
be
shed
in
vain
,
if
the
true
religion
of
God
is
restored
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
as
strongly
as
the
blessed
Winifred
herself
resisted
the
impious
ravisher
,
Caradoc
,
will
I
resist
all
inducements
to
turn
aside
from
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
the
enterprise
will
fail
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
we
shall
perish
.
<EOS>
But
if
we
die
thus
,
we
shall
die
as
martyrs
,
and
our
deaths
will
be
highly
profitable
to
the
Catholic
religion
.
<EOS>
""I
doubt
it
,
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
son
,
"
said
Garnet
,
solemnly
,
"
I
have
ever
looked
upon
you
as
one
destined
to
be
the
chief
agent
in
the
great
work
of
redemption
.
<EOS>
I
have
thought
that
,
like
Judith
,
you
were
chosen
to
destroy
the
Holofernes
who
oppresses
us
.
<EOS>
Having
noted
in
you
a
religious
fervour
,
and
resolution
admirably
fitting
you
for
the
task
,
I
thought
,
and
still
think
you
expressly
chosen
by
Heaven
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
have
any
misgiving
,
I
beseech
you
to
withdraw
from
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
absolve
you
from
your
oath
;
and
,
enjoining
you
only
to
strictest
secrecy
,
will
pray
you
to
depart
at
once
,
lest
your
irresolution
should
be
communicated
to
the
others
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
from
me
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
irresolution
,
no
wavering
,
nor
shall
any
engaged
with
us
be
shaken
by
my
apprehension
.
<EOS>
You
have
asked
me
what
I
saw
and
heard
,
and
I
have
told
you
truly
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
speak
of
it
no
more
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
well
to
observe
silence
,
my
son
,
"
answered
Garnet
;
"
for
though
you
,
like
myself
,
are
unnerved
,
its
effect
on
others
might
be
injurious
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
yet
brought
your
relation
to
an
end
.
<EOS>
How
did
the
figure
disappear?""As
<EOS>
it
arose
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Uttering
in
a
sweet
but
solemn
voice
,
which
yet
rings
in
my
cars
,
the
words
,
'
Be
warned
!
'
<EOS>
it
glided
back
to
the
fountain
,
whose
waves
as
it
approached
grew
still
,
and
gradually
melted
from
my
view
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
when
I
came
hither
,
you
appeared
to
be
gazing
at
the
spring
,
"
said
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
What
did
you
then
behold?""My
<EOS>
first
impulse
on
awakening
about
an
hour
ago
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
was
to
prostrate
myself
before
the
fountain
,
and
to
entreat
the
intercession
of
the
saint
,
who
had
thus
marvellously
revealed
herself
to
me
.
<EOS>
As
I
prayed
,
methought
its
clear
lucid
waters
became
turbid
,
and
turned
to
the
colour
of
blood
.
<EOS>
""It
is
a
type
of
the
blood
of
slaughtered
brethren
of
our
faith
,
which
has
been
shed
by
our
oppressors
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Rather
<EOS>
of
our
own
,
which
shall
be
poured
forth
in
this
cause
,
"
retorted
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
matter
.
<EOS>
I
am
prepared
to
lose
the
last
drop
of
mine
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
"
said
Garnet
;
"
and
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
like
those
holy
men
who
have
suffered
for
their
faith
,
that
we
shall
both
win
a
crown
of
martyrdom
.
<EOS>
""Amen
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
think
the
sacrifice
we
are
about
to
offer
will
prove
acceptable
to
God?""I
am
convinced
of
it
,
my
son
,
"
answered
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
take
the
sainted
virgin
,
from
whose
blood
this
marvellous
spring
was
produced
,
to
witness
that
I
devote
myself
unhesitatingly
to
the
project
,
and
that
I
firmly
believe
it
will
profit
our
church
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
a
singular
circumstance
occurred
,
which
did
not
fail
to
produce
an
impression
on
both
parties,—especially
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
A
violent
gust
of
wind
,
apparently
suddenly
aroused
,
whistled
through
the
slender
columns
of
the
structure
,
and
catching
the
surface
of
the
water
<EOS>
dashed
it
in
tiny
waves
against
their
feet
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
saint
is
offended
,
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"It
would
almost
seem
so
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
proceed
to
the
chapel
,
and
pray
at
her
shrine
.
<EOS>
We
will
confer
on
this
matter
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
swear
to
me
that
you
will
observe
profound
secrecy
respecting
this
vision
.
<EOS>
""I
swear
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
another
and
more
violent
gust
agitated
the
fountain
.
<EOS>
"We
will
tarry
here
no
longer
,
"
said
Garnet
,
"
I
am
not
proof
against
these
portents
of
ill
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
Here
they
were
presently
joined
by
several
of
the
female
devotees
,
including
Viviana
,
Anne
Vaux
,
and
Lady
Digby
.
<EOS>
Matins
were
then
said
,
after
which
various
offerings
were
made
at
the
shrine
of
the
saint
.
<EOS>
Lady
Digby
presented
a
small
tablet
set
in
gold
,
representing
on
one
side
the
martyrdom
of
Saint
Winifred
,
and
on
the
other
the
Salutation
of
our
Lady
.
<EOS>
Anne
Vaux
gave
a
small
enamelled
cross
of
gold
;
Viviana
a
girdle
of
the
same
metal
,
with
a
pendant
sustaining
a
small
Saint
John
's
head
surrounded
with
pearls
.
<EOS>
"Mine
will
be
a
poor
soldier
's
offering
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
approaching
the
shrine
,
which
was
hung
around
with
the
crutches
,
staves
,
and
bandages
of
those
cured
by
the
healing
waters
of
the
miraculous
spring
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
small
silver
scallop
-
shell
,
given
me
by
a
pilgrim
,
who
died
in
my
arms
near
the
chapel
of
Saint
James
of
Compostella
,
in
Spain
,
is
the
sole
valuable
I
possess
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
as
acceptable
as
a
more
costly
gift
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
placing
it
on
the
shrine
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
offerings
then
made
,
that
silver
scallop
-

THE
CONSPIRATORSOn
Viviana
's
return
from
her
devotions
<EOS>
,
she
found
her
father
in
the
greatest
perturbation
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
old
steward
,
Heydocke
,
who
had
ridden
express
from
Ordsall
Hall
,
had
just
arrived
,
bringing
word
that
the
miserable
fate
of
the
pursuivant
and
his
crew
had
aroused
the
whole
country
;
that
officers
,
attended
by
a
strong
force
,
and
breathing
vengeance
,
were
in
pursuit
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
and
his
daughter
;
that
large
sums
were
offered
for
the
capture
of
Guy
Fawkes
and
Father
Oldcorne
;
that
most
of
the
servants
were
imprisoned
;
that
he
himself
had
escaped
with
great
difficulty
;
and
that
,
to
sum
up
this
long
catalogue
of
calamities
,
Master
Humphrey
Chetham
was
arrested
,
and
placed
in
the
New
Fleet
.
<EOS>
"
In
short
,
my
dear
young
mistress
,
"
concluded
the
old
man
,
"
as
I
have
just
observed
to
Sir
William
,
all
is
over
with
us
,
and
there
is
nothing
left
but
the
grave
.
<EOS>
""What
course
have
you
resolved
upon
,
dear
father
,
"
inquired
Viviana
,
turning
anxiously
to
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
surrender
myself
,
"
he
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
guilty
of
no
crime
,
and
can
easily
clear
myself
from
all
imputation
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
hope
for
justice
from
those
who
know
it
not
.
<EOS>
But
,
while
the
means
of
escape
are
allowed
you
,
avail
yourself
of
them
.
<EOS>
""No
,
Viviana
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
firmly
;
"
my
part
is
taken
.
<EOS>
I
shall
abide
the
arrival
of
the
officers
.
<EOS>
For
you
,
I
shall
intrust
you
to
the
care
of
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
mean
this
,
dear
father
,
"
she
cried
,
with
a
look
of
distress
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
if
you
do
,
I
will
never
consent
to
such
an
arrangement
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
is
strongly
attached
to
you
,
child
,
"
replied
Sir
William
,
"
and
will
watch
over
your
safety
as
carefully
as
I
could
do
myself
.
<EOS>
""He
may
be
attached
to
me
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
"
<EOS>
though
I
doubt
the
disinterestedness
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
can
remove
my
repugnance
to
him
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
,
therefore
,
if
,
in
this
one
instance
,
I
decline
to
obey
your
commands
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
trust
myself
with
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
am
I
to
understand
you
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sir
William
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
ask
me
to
explain
,
dear
father
,
"
she
answered
,
"
but
imagine
I
must
have
good
reason
for
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Since
you
are
resolved
upon
surrendering
yourself
,
I
will
go
into
captivity
with
you
.
<EOS>
The
alternative
is
less
dreadful
than
that
you
have
proposed
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
distract
me
,
child
,
"
cried
the
knight
,
rising
and
pacing
the
chamber
in
great
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
bear
the
thought
of
your
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
Yet
if
I
fly
,
I
appear
to
confess
myself
guilty
.
<EOS>
""If
your
worship
will
intrust
Mistress
Viviana
with
me
,
"
interposed
the
old
steward
,
"
I
will
convey
her
whithersoever
<EOS>
you
direct,—will
watch
over
her
day
and
night,—and
,
if
need
be
,
die
in
her
defence
.
<EOS>
""Thou
wert
ever
a
faithful
servant
,
good
Heydocke
,
"
rejoined
Sir
William
,
extending
his
hand
kindly
to
him
,
"
and
art
as
true
in
adversity
as
in
prosperity
.
<EOS>
""Shame
<EOS>
to
me
if
I
were
not
,
"
replied
Heydocke
,
pressing
the
knight
's
fingers
to
his
lips
and
bathing
them
in
his
tears
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shame
to
me
if
I
hesitated
to
lay
down
my
life
for
a
master
to
whom
I
owe
so
much
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
it
is
your
pleasure
,
dear
father
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
"
I
will
accompany
Master
Heydocke
;
but
I
would
far
rather
be
permitted
to
remain
with
you
.
<EOS>
""It
would
avail
nothing
,
"
replied
Sir
William
,
"
we
should
be
separated
by
the
officers
.
<EOS>
Retire
to
your
chamber
,
and
prepare
for
instant
departure
;
and
,
in
the
mean
while
,
I
will
consider
what
is
best
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
worship
's
decision
must
be
speedy
,
"
observed
Heydocke
;
"
I
had
only
a
few
hours
'
start
of
the
officers
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
here
ere
long
.
<EOS>
""Take
this
purse
,
"
replied
Sir
William
,
"
and
hire
three
of
the
fleetest
horses
you
can
procure
,
and
station
yourself
at
the
outskirts
of
the
town
,
on
the
road
to
Saint
Asaph
.
<EOS>
You
understand
.
<EOS>
""Perfectly
,
"
replied
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
And
he
departed
to
execute
his
master
's
commands
,
while
Viviana
withdrew
to
her
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
the
knight
was
perplexing
himself
as
to
where
he
should
shape
his
course
,
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
sudden
entrance
of
Catesby
and
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
just
met
your
servant
,
Sir
William
,
"
said
the
former
,
"
and
have
learnt
the
alarming
intelligence
he
has
brought
.
<EOS>
""What
is
your
counsel
in
this
emergency
,
father
?
"
said
Radcliffe
,
appealing
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Flight,—instant
flight
,
my
son
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
counsel
is
resistance
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
here
assembled
in
large
numbers
,
and
are
well
armed
.
<EOS>
Let
us
await
the
arrival
of
the
officers
,
and
see
whether
they
will
venture
to
arrest
you
.
<EOS>
""They
will
arrest
us
all
,
if
they
have
force
sufficient
to
do
so
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
and
there
are
many
reasons
,
as
you
well
know
,
why
it
is
desirable
to
avoid
any
disturbance
at
present
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
say
you
then
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Radcliffe
,
"
to
our
immediate
return
to
Holt
,
where
means
may
be
found
to
screen
you
till
this
storm
is
blown
over?"Sir
<EOS>
William
having
assented
to
the
proposal
,
Catesby
instantly
departed
to
acquaint
the
others
,
and
,
as
soon
as
preparations
could
be
made
,
and
horses
procured
,
the
whole
party
composing
the
pilgrimage
quitted
Holywell
,
and
,
ascending
the
hill
at
the
back
of
the
town
,
took
the
direction
of
Mold
,
where
they
arrived
,
having
ridden
at
a
swift
pace
,
in
about
half
an
hour
.
<EOS>
From
thence
they
proceeded
,
without
accident
or
interruption
,
to
the
mansion
they
had
recently
occupied
near
Holt
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
it
,
all
the
domestics
were
armed
,
and
certain
of
their
number
stationed
at
the
different
approaches
to
the
house
to
give
the
alarm
in
case
of
the
enemy
's
appearance
.
<EOS>
But
as
nothing
occurred
during
the
night
,
the
fears
of
Sir
William
and
his
friends
began
in
some
degree
to
subside
.
<EOS>
About
noon
,
on
the
following
day
,
as
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
ever
since
the
vision
at
<EOS>
Saint
Winifred
's
Well
had
shunned
all
companionship
,
walked
forth
beneath
the
avenue
alone
<EOS>
,
he
heard
a
light
step
behind
him
,
and
,
turning
,
beheld
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Gravely
bowing
,
he
was
about
to
pursue
his
course
,
when
quickening
her
pace
she
was
instantly
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
"I
have
a
favour
to
solicit
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"There
is
none
I
would
refuse
you
,
"
answered
Fawkes
,
halting
;
"
but
,
though
I
have
the
will
,
I
may
not
have
the
power
to
grant
your
request
.
<EOS>
""Hear
<EOS>
me
,
then
,
"
she
replied
,
hurriedly
.
<EOS>
"
Of
all
my
father
's
friends
—
of
all
who
are
here
assembled
,
you
are
the
only
one
I
dare
trust,—the
only
one
from
whom
I
can
hope
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
""I
am
at
once
flattered
and
perplexed
by
your
words
,
Viviana
<EOS>
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
nor
can
I
guess
whither
they
tend
.
<EOS>
But
speak
freely
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
not
render
you
aid
,
I
can
at
least
give
you
counsel
.
<EOS>
""I
must
premise
,
then
,
"
said
Viviana
,
"
that
I
am
aware
from
certain
obscure
hints
<EOS>
let
fall
by
Father
Oldcorne
,
that
you
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
and
others
are
engaged
in
a
dark
and
dangerous
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
<EOS>
Radcliffe
,
"
returned
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
,
"
you
have
once
before
avowed
your
knowledge
of
this
plot
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
attempt
disguise
with
you
.
<EOS>
A
project
is
in
agitation
for
the
deliverance
of
our
fallen
church
;
and
,
since
you
have
become
acquainted
with
its
existence
—
no
matter
how
—
you
must
be
bound
by
an
oath
of
secrecy
,
or
,
"
and
his
look
grew
darker
,
and
his
voice
sterner
,
"
I
will
not
answer
for
your
life
.
<EOS>
""I
will
willingly
take
the
oath
,
on
certain
conditions
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
must
take
it
unconditionally
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Hear
me
out
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Knowing
that
Mr.
Catesby
and
Father
Garnet
are
anxious
to
induce
my
father
to
join
this
conspiracy
,
I
came
hither
to
implore
you
to
prevent
him
from
doing
so
.
<EOS>
""Were
<EOS>
I
even
willing
to
do
this,—which
<EOS>
I
am
not
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
I
have
not
the
power
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Radcliffe
would
be
justly
indignant
at
any
interference
on
my
part
.
<EOS>
""Heed
not
that
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
,
I
fear
,
are
linked
to
this
fearful
project
beyond
the
possibility
of
being
set
free
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
not
.
<EOS>
Save
him
!
<EOS>
save
him!""I
will
take
no
part
in
urging
him
to
join
it
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
can
promise
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
mark
me
,
"
she
returned
;
"
if
further
attempts
are
made
by
any
of
your
confederates
to
league
him
with
their
plot
,
I
myself
will
disclose
all
I
know
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
in
a
threatening
tone
,
"
I
again
warn
you
that
you
endanger
your
life
.
<EOS>
""I
care
not
<EOS>
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
I
would
risk
twenty
lives
,
if
I
possessed
them
,
to
preserve
my
father
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
noble
-
hearted
lady
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
unable
to
repress
the
admiration
inspired
by
her
conduct
;
"
and
if
I
can
accomplish
what
you
desire
,
I
will
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
not
how
it
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
""Everything
is
possible
to
one
of
your
resolution
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
a
slight
smile
crossing
his
rugged
features
;
"
the
effort
at
least
shall
be
made
.
""Thanks
!
<EOS>
thanks
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Viviana
;
and
,
overcome
by
her
emotion
,
she
sank
half
-
fainting
into
his
arms
.
<EOS>
While
he
held
her
thus
,
debating
within
himself
whether
he
should
convey
her
to
the
house
,
Garnet
and
Catesby
appeared
at
the
other
end
of
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Their
surprise
at
the
sight
was
extreme
;
nor
was
it
less
when
Viviana
,
opening
her
eyes
as
they
drew
near
,
uttered
a
slight
cry
,
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"This
requires
an
explanation
,
"
said
Catesby
,
glancing
fiercely
at
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"You
must
seek
it
,
then
,
of
the
lady
,
"
rejoined
the
latter
,
moodily
.
<EOS>
"It
will
be
easily
explained
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
"
interposed
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
Miss
Radcliffe
was
seized
with
a
momentary
weakness
,
and
her
companion
offered
her
support
.
<EOS>
""That
will
scarcely
suffice
for
me
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
the
subject
be
dropped
for
the
present
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
More
important
matter
claims
our
attention
.
<EOS>
We
came
to
seek
you
,
my
son
,
"
he
continued
,
addressing
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
All
those
engaged
in
the
great
enterprise
are
about
to
meet
in
a
summer
-
house
in
the
garden
.
<EOS>
""I
am
ready
to
attend
you
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
Sir
William
Radcliffe
be
there?""No
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
he
has
not
yet
joined
us
.
<EOS>
None
will
be
present
at
this
meeting
but
the
sworn
conspirators
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
the
trio
took
their
way
towards
the
garden
,
and
proceeding
along
a
walk
edged
with
clipped
yew
-
trees
,
came
to
the
summer
-
house,—a
small
circular
building
overrun
with
ivy
and
creepers
,
and
ornamented
in
front
by
two
stone
statues
on
pedestals
.
<EOS>
Here
they
found
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
Ambrose
Rookwood
,
Francis
Tresham
,
Thomas
and
Robert
Winter
,
John
and
Christopher
Wright
,
awaiting
their
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
door
being
closed
and
bolted
,
Garnet
,
placing
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
assemblage
,
said
,
"
Before
we
proceed
further
,
I
will
again
administer
the
oath
to
all
present
.
"
<EOS>
Drawing
from
his
vest
a
primer
,
and
addressing
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
he
desired
him
to
kneel
,
and
continued
thus
in
a
solemn
tone
,
"
You
shall
swear
by
the
Blessed
Trinity
,
and
by
the
sacrament
you
propose
to
receive
,
never
to
disclose
directly
nor
indirectly
,
by
word
or
circumstance
,
the
matter
that
shall
be
proposed
to
you
to
keep
secret
,
nor
desist
from
the
execution
thereof
,
until
the
rest
shall
give
you
leave
.
<EOS>
""I
swear
,
"
replied
Digby
,
kissing
the
primer
.
<EOS>
The
oath
was
then
taken
in
like
manner
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Catesby
was
about
to
address
the
meeting
,
when
Tresham
,
glancing
uneasily
at
the
door
,
remarked
,
"
Are
you
assured
we
have
no
eavesdroppers?""I
will
keep
watch
without
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
"
if
you
have
any
fears
.
<EOS>
""It
were
better
,
"
replied
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
be
too
cautious
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
go
forth
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
take
part
in
the
discussion
.
<EOS>
""My
part
is
to
act
,
not
talk
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
marching
towards
the
door
.
<EOS>
And
shutting
it
after
him
,
he
took
up
his
position
outside
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
Catesby
commenced
a
long
and
inflammatory
harangue
,
in
which
he
expatiated
with
great
eloquence
and
fervour
on
the
wrongs
of
the
Catholic
party
,
and
the
deplorable
condition
of
their
church
.
<EOS>
"
It
were
easy
to
slay
the
tyrant
by
whom
we
are
oppressed
,
"
he
said
,
in
conclusion
;
"
but
his
destruction
would
be
small
gain
to
us
.
<EOS>
We
must
strike
deeper
,
to
hew
down
the
baneful
stock
of
heresy
.
<EOS>
All
our
adversaries
must
perish
with
him
,
and
in
such
a
manner
as
shall
best
attest
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
.
<EOS>
Placed
beneath
the
Parliament
-
house
,
a
mine
of
powder
shall
hurl
its
heretical
occupants
into
the
air,—nor
shall
any
one
survive
the
terrible
explosion
.
<EOS>
Are
we
all
agreed
to
this
plan?"All
<EOS>
the
conspirators
expressed
their
assent
,
except
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
I
give
my
concurrence
to
the
measure
,
"
observed
the
latter
,
"
I
would
fain
be
resolved
by
Father
Garnet
whether
it
is
lawful
to
destroy
some
few
of
our
own
faith
with
so
many
heretics
.
<EOS>
""Unquestionably
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
As
in
besieging
a
city
we
have
a
right
to
kill
all
within
it
,
whether
friends
or
enemies
,
so
in
this
case
we
are
justified
in
destroying
the
innocent
with
the
guilty
,
because
their
destruction
will
be
advantageous
to
the
Catholic
cause
.
<EOS>
""I
am
satisfied
,
"
replied
Digby
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
to
the
tyrant
and
apostate
James
,
"
continued
Garnet
,
"
he
is
excommunicated
,
and
his
subjects
released
from
their
allegiance
.
<EOS>
I
have
two
breves
sent
over
by
his
holiness
Pope
Clement
VIII
.
<EOS>
three
years
ago
,
one
directed
to
the
clergy
,
and
the
other
to
the
nobility
of
this
realm
,
wherein
,
alluding
to
Queen
Elizabeth
<EOS>
,
it
is
expressly
declared
that
,
'
so
soon
as
that
miserable
woman
should
depart
out
of
this
life
,
none
shall
be
permitted
to
ascend
the
throne
,
how
near
soever
in
proximity
of
blood
,
unless
they
are
such
as
will
not
only
tolerate
the
Catholic
faith
,
but
in
every
way
support
it
.
'
<EOS>
By
this
brief
,
James
is
expressly
excluded
.
<EOS>
He
has
betrayed
,
not
supported
the
church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
Having
broken
his
word
with
us
,
and
oppressed
our
brethren
more
rigorously
even
than
his
predecessor
,
the
remorseless
Elizabeth
,
he
is
unworthy
longer
to
reign
,
and
must
be
removed
.
<EOS>
""He
must
,
"
reiterated
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Parliament
-
house
being
the
place
where
all
the
mischief
done
<EOS>
us
has
been
contrived
by
our
adversaries
,
it
is
fitting
that
it
should
be
the
place
of
their
chastisement
,
"
remarked
Catesby
.
"Doubtless
,
"
rejoined
Ambrose
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"Yet
<EOS>
if
the
blow
we
meditate
should
miscarry
,
"
observed
Thomas
Winter
,
"
<EOS>
the
injury
to
the
Catholic
religion
will
be
so
great
,
that
not
only
our
enemies
,
but
our
very
friends
will
condemn
us
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
chance
of
miscarriage
,
if
we
are
true
to
each
other
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
confidently
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
I
suspected
any
one
of
treachery
,
I
would
plunge
my
sword
into
his
bosom
,
were
he
my
brother
.
<EOS>
""You
would
do
wrong
to
act
thus
on
mere
suspicion
,
"
remarked
Tresham
,
who
stood
near
him
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
case
like
this
<EOS>
,
he
who
gives
the
slightest
ground
for
doubt
would
merit
death
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
sternly
;
"
and
I
would
slay
him
.
<EOS>
""Hum
!
"
exclaimed
Tresham
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
will
now
perhaps
inform
us
what
has
been
done
to
carry
the
project
into
effect
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
"A
small
habitation
has
been
taken
by
one
of
our
confederates
,
Mr.
Thomas
Percy
,
immediately
adjoining
the
Parliament
-
house
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
from
the
cellar
of
which
it
is
proposed
to
dig
a
mine
through
the
wall
of
the
devoted
building
,
and
to
deposit
within
it
a
sufficient
quantity
of
gunpowder
and
other
combustibles
to
accomplish
our
purpose
.
<EOS>
This
mine
must
be
digged
by
ourselves
,
as
we
can
employ
no
assistants
,
and
will
be
a
laborious
and
dangerous
task
.
<EOS>
But
I
for
one
will
cheerfully
undertake
it
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
"
said
the
elder
Wright
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
cried
several
others
.
<EOS>
"Supposing
<EOS>
the
mine
digged
,
and
the
powder
deposited
,
"
observed
Ambrose
Rookwood
,
"
whose
hand
will
fire
the
train?""Mine
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
throwing
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
spoken
,
he
retired
and
closed
it
after
him
.
<EOS>
"He
will
keep
his
word
,
"
remarked
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
He
is
of
a
nature
so
resolute
that
he
would
destroy
himself
with
the
victims
rather
than
fail
.
<EOS>
Catiline
was
not
a
bolder
conspirator
than
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
"
we
are
now
at
the
latter
end
of
July
.
<EOS>
All
must
be
ready
against
the
meeting
of
Parliament
in
November
.
<EOS>
""There
is
some
likelihood
,
I
hear
,
that
the
meeting
of
the
house
will
be
prorogued
till
February
,
"
remarked
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
much
the
better
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
it
will
give
us
more
time
for
preparation
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
much
the
worse
<EOS>
,
I
think
,
"
cried
Ambrose
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
Delays
are
ever
dangerous
,
and
doubly
dangerous
in
a
case
like
ours
.
<EOS>
""I
am
far
from
desiring
to
throw
any
impediment
in
the
way
of
our
design
,
"
observed
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
"
but
I
would
recommend
,
before
we
proceed
to
this
terrible
extremity
,
that
one
last
effort
should
be
made
to
move
the
King
in
our
behalf
.
<EOS>
""It
is
useless
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
So
far
from
toleration
,
he
meditates
severer
measures
against
us
;
and
,
I
am
well
assured
,
if
Parliament
is
allowed
to
meet
,
such
laws
will
be
passed
as
will
bring
all
of
us
within
premunire
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
hope
from
James
,
nor
his
ministers
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
yet
from
France
or
Spain
,
"
observed
Thomas
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
In
my
conference
with
the
Constable
Velasco
at
Bergen
,
I
received
assurances
of
the
good
-
will
of
Philip
towards
us
,
but
no
distinct
promise
of
interference
in
our
behalf
.
<EOS>
The
Archduke
Albert
is
well
disposed
,
but
he
can
render
no
assistance
.
<EOS>
We
must
depend
upon
ourselves
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
marry
,
<EOS>
must
we
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
and
fortunate
<EOS>
is
it
that
we
have
devised
a
plan
by
which
we
can
accomplish
our
purpose
unaided
.
<EOS>
We
only
require
funds
to
follow
up
with
effect
the
blow
we
shall
strike
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
whole
fortune
shall
be
placed
at
your
disposal
,
"
replied
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
"Part
of
mine
has
already
been
given
,
"
said
Tresham
,
"
and
the
rest
shall
follow
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
I
had
aught
to
peril
in
the
matter
except
my
life
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
throw
everything
upon
the
stake
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
enough
in
venturing
thus
much
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
you
the
whole
conduct
of
the
enterprise
is
committed
.
<EOS>
""I
live
for
nothing
else
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
and
if
I
see
it
successful
,
I
shall
have
lived
long
enough
.
<EOS>
""Cannot
<EOS>
Sir
William
Radcliffe
be
induced
to
join
us
?
"
asked
Rookwood
.
"
<EOS>
He
would
be
an
important
acquisition
,
and
his
wealth
would
prove
highly
serviceable
.
<EOS>
""I
have
sounded
him
,
"
answered
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
appears
reluctant
.
<EOS>
""Be
not
satisfied
with
one
attempt
,
"
urged
Christopher
Wright
.
<EOS>
"
The
jeopardy
in
which
he
now
stands
may
make
him
change
his
mind
.
<EOS>
""I
am
loth
to
interrupt
the
discussion
,
"
returned
Garnet
,
"
but
I
think
we
have
tarried
here
long
enough
.
<EOS>
We
will
meet
again
at
midnight
,
when
I
hope
to
introduce
Sir
William
Radcliffe
to
you
as
a
confederate
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
party
then
separated
,
and
Garnet
went
in
search
of
the
knight
.
<EOS>
Ascertaining
that
he
was
in
his
own
chamber
,
he
proceeded
thither
,
and
found
him
alone
.
<EOS>
Entering
at
once
upon
the
subject
in
hand
,
Garnet
pleaded
his
cause
with
so
much
zeal
that
he
at
last
wrung
a
reluctant
consent
from
the
listener
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
conceal
his
exultation
,
he
then
proposed
to
Sir
William
to
adjourn
with
him
to
the
private
chapel
in
the
house
,
where
,
having
taken
the
oath
,
and
received
the
sacrament
upon
it
,
he
should
forthwith
be
introduced
to
the
conspirators
,
and
the
whole
particulars
of
the
plot
revealed
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
knight
,
with
some
hesitation
,
agreed
.
<EOS>
As
they
traversed
a
gallery
leading
to
the
chapel
,
they
met
Viviana
.
<EOS>
For
the
first
time
in
his
life
Radcliffe
's
gaze
sank
before
his
daughter
,
and
he
would
have
passed
her
without
speaking
had
she
not
stopped
him
.
"Father
!
<EOS>
dear
father
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
"
I
know
whither
you
are
going
—
and
for
what
purpose
.
<EOS>
Do
not
—
do
not
join
them
.
<EOS>
"IllustrationSir
<EOS>
William
Radcliffe
made
no
reply
,
but
endeavoured
gently
to
push
her
aside
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
however
,
be
repulsed
,
but
prostrating
herself
before
him
,
clasped
his
knees
,
and
besought
him
not
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
Making
a
significant
gesture
to
Sir
William
,
Garnet
walked
forward
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
,
"
cried
the
knight
,
sternly
,
"
my
resolution
is
taken
.
<EOS>
I
command
you
to
retire
to
your
chamber
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
broke
from
her
,
and
followed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
Clasping
her
hands
to
her
brow
,
Viviana
gazed
for
a
moment
with
a
frenzied
look
after
him
,
and
then
rushed
from
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
chapel
,
Sir
William
,
who
had
been
much
shaken
by
this
meeting
,
was
some
minutes
in
recovering
his
composure
.
<EOS>
Garnet
employed
the
time
in
renewing
his
arguments
,
and
with
so
much
address
that
he
succeeded
in
quieting
the
scruples
of
conscience
which
had
been
awakened
in
the
knight
's
breast
by
his
daughter
's
warning
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
my
son
,
"
he
said
,
"
since
you
have
determined
to
enrol
your
name
in
the
list
of
those
sworn
to
deliver
their
church
from
oppression
,
take
this
primer
in
your
hand
,
and
kneel
down
before
the
altar
,
while
I
administer
the
oath
which
is
to
unite
you
to
us
.
"Garnet
<EOS>
then
advanced
towards
the
altar
,
and
Sir
William
was
about
to
prostrate
himself
upon
a
cushion
beside
it
,
when
the
door
was
suddenly
thrown
open
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
strode
into
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
"Hold
<EOS>
!
"
he
exclaimed
,
grasping
Radcliffe
's
right
arm
,
and
fixing
his
dark
glance
upon
him
;
"
you
shall
not
take
that
oath
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Garnet
,
who
,
as
well
as
the
knight
,
was
paralyzed
with
astonishment
at
this
intrusion
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
William
Radcliffe
is
about
to
join
us
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
it
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
but
it
may
not
be
.
<EOS>
He
has
no
heart
in
the
business
,
and
will
lend
it
no
efficient
assistance
.
<EOS>
We
are
better
without
him
,
than
with
him
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
took
the
primer
from
the
knight
's
hand
,
and
laid
it
upon
the
altar
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
conduct
is
inexplicable
,
"
cried
Garnet
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
answer
for
it
to
others
,
as
well
as
to
me
.
<EOS>
""I
will
answer
for
it
to
all
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Let
Sir
William
Radcliffe
declare
before
me
,
and
before
Heaven
,
that
he
approves
the
measure
,
and
I
am
content
he
should
take
the
oath
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
belie
my
conscience
by
saying
so
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
who
appeared
agitated
by
conflicting
emotions
.
<EOS>
"Yet
<EOS>
you
have
promised
to
join
us
,
"
cried
Garnet
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"Better
break
that
promise
than
a
solemn
oath
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
there
are
reasons
why
you
should
not
join
this
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
Examine
your
inmost
heart
,
and
it
will
tell
you
what
they
are
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
you
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"Get
<EOS>
hence
,
"
cried
Garnet
,
unable
to
control
his
indignation
,
"
or
I
will
pronounce
our
Church
's
most
terrible
malediction
against
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
not
shrink
from
it
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
humbly
,
but
firmly
,
"
seeing
I
am
acting
rightly
.
<EOS>
""Undeceive
<EOS>
yourself
,
then
,
at
once
,
"
returned
Garnet
,
"
and
learn
that
you
are
thwarting
our
great
and
holy
purpose
.
<EOS>
""On
<EOS>
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
I
am
promoting
it
,
by
preventing
one
from
joining
it
who
will
endanger
its
success
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
traitor
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Garnet
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"A
traitor
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Guy
Fawkes
,
his
eye
blazing
with
fierce
lustre
,
though
his
voice
and
demeanour
were
unaltered,—"I
,
who
have
been
warned
thrice,—twice
by
the
dead,—and
lastly
by
a
vision
from
heaven
,
yet
still
remain
firm
to
my
purpose,—I
,
who
have
voluntarily
embraced
the
most
dangerous
and
difficult
part
of
the
enterprise,—I
,
who
would
suffer
the
utmost
extremity
of
torture
,
rather
than
utter
a
word
that
should
reveal
it,—a
traitor
!
<EOS>
No
,
father
,
I
am
none
.
<EOS>
If
you
think
so
,
take
this
sword
and
at
once
put
an
end
to
your
doubts
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
something
so
irresistible
in
the
manner
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
that
Garnet
remained
silent
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
with
me
what
you
please
,
"
continued
Fawkes
;
"
but
do
not
compel
Sir
William
Radcliffe
to
join
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
fatal
to
it
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
one
shall
compel
me
to
join
it
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"Perhaps
<EOS>
it
is
better
thus
,
"
returned
Garnet
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
he
was
buried
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
urge
you
no
further
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
But
before
you
depart
you
must
swear
not
to
divulge
what
you
have
just
learnt
.
<EOS>
""Willingly
,
"
replied
the
knight
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
another
person
who
must
also
take
that
oath
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
having
accidentally
become
acquainted
with
as
much
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
stepping
out
of
the
chapel
,
he
immediately
afterwards
returned
with
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
will
now
understand
why
I
would
not
allow
Sir
William
to
join
the
conspiracy
,
"
he
observed
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
the
latter
,
gloomily
.
<EOS>
The
oath
administered
,
the
knight
and
his
daughter
quitted
the
chapel
,
accompanied
by
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Viviana
was
profuse
in
her
expressions
of
gratitude
,
nor
was
her
father
less
earnest
in
his
acknowledgments
.
<EOS>
A
few
hours
after
this
,
Sir
William
Radcliffe
informed
Sir
Everard
Digby
that
it
was
his
intention
to
depart
immediately
,
and
,
though
the
latter
attempted
to
dissuade
him
by
representing
the
danger
to
which
he
would
be
exposed
,
he
continued
inflexible
.
<EOS>
The
announcement
surprised
both
Catesby
and
Garnet
,
who
were
present
when
it
was
made
,
and
added
their
entreaties
to
those
of
Digby
—
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
Catesby
's
proposal
to
serve
as
an
escort
was
likewise
refused
by
Sir
William
,
who
said
he
had
no
fears
,
and
when
questioned
as
to
his
destination
,
he
returned
an
evasive
answer
.
<EOS>
This
sudden
resolution
of
the
knight
coupled
with
his
refusal
to
join
the
plot
,
alarmed
the
conspirators
,
and
more
than
one
expressed
fears
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
however
,
was
not
of
the
number
,
but
asserted
that
Radcliffe
was
a
man
of
the
highest
honour
,
and
he
would
answer
for
his
secrecy
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
answer
for
that
of
his
daughter
?
"
demanded
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"To
put
the
matter
beyond
a
doubt
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
"
I
will
set
out
shortly
after
him
,
and
follow
him
unobserved
till
he
halts
for
the
night
,
and
ascertain
whether
he
stops
at
any
suspicious
quarter
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
so
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"It
is
needless
,
"
observed
Sir
Everard
Digby
;
"
but
do
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
,
Radcliffe
's
horses
being
brought
round
by
Heydocke
,
he
and
his
daughter
took
a
hasty
leave
of
their
friends
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
been
gone
a
few
minutes
,
Catesby
called
for
his
steed
;
and
,
after
exchanging
a
word
or
two
with
Garnet
,
rode
after
them
.
<EOS>
He
had
proceeded
about
a
couple
of
miles
along
a
cross
-
road
leading
to
Nantwich
,
which
he
learnt
from
some
cottagers
was
the
route
taken
by
the
party
before
him
,
when
he
heard
the
tramp
of
a
horse
in
the
rear
,
and
,
turning
at
the
sound
,
beheld
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Drawing
in
the
bridle
,
he
halted
till
the
latter
came
up
,
and
angrily
demanded
on
what
errand
<EOS>
he
was
bent
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
errand
is
the
same
as
your
own
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
intend
to
follow
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
and
,
if
need
be
,
defend
him
.
<EOS>
"Whatever
<EOS>
Catesby
's
objections
might
be
to
this
companionship
,
he
did
not
think
fit
to
declare
them
,
and
,
though
evidently
much
displeased
,
suffered
Guy
Fawkes
to
ride
by
his
side
without
opposition
.
<EOS>
Having
gained
the
summit
of
the
mountainous
range
extending
from
Malpas
to
Tottenhall
,
whence
they
beheld
the
party
whose
course
they
were
tracking
enter
a
narrow
lane
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
Catesby
,
fearful
of
losing
sight
of
them
,
set
spurs
to
his
steed
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
kept
close
beside
him
,
and
they
did
not
slacken
their
pace
until
they
reached
the
lane
.
<EOS>
Having
proceeded
along
it
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
they
were
alarmed
by
the
sudden
report
of
fire
-
arms
,
followed
by
a
loud
shriek
,
which
neither
of
them
doubted
was
uttered
by
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Again
dashing
forward
,
on
turning
a
corner
of
the
road
,
they
beheld
the
party
surrounded
by
half
-
a
-
dozen
troopers
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Radcliffe
had
shot
one
of
his
assailants
,
and
,
assisted
by
Heydocke
,
was
defending
himself
bravely
against
the
others
.
<EOS>
With
loud
shouts
,
Catesby
and
Guy
Fawkes
galloped
towards
the
scene
of
strife
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
too
late
.
<EOS>
A
bullet
pierced
the
knight
's
brain
;
and
he
no
sooner
fell
,
than
,
regardless
of
himself
,
the
old
steward
flung
away
his
sword
,
and
threw
himself
,
with
the
most
piteous
lamentations
,
on
the
body
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
meanwhile
,
had
been
compelled
to
dismount
,
and
was
in
the
hands
of
the
troopers
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
her
father
's
fate
,
her
shrieks
were
so
heart
-
piercing
,
that
even
her
captors
were
moved
to
compassion
.
<EOS>
Fighting
his
way
towards
her
,
Catesby
cut
down
one
of
the
troopers
,
and
snatching
her
from
the
grasp
of
the
other
,
who
was
terrified
by
the
furious
assault
,
placed
her
on
the
saddle
beside
him
,
and
striking
spurs
into
his
charger
at
the
same
moment
,
leapt
the
hedge
,
and
made
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
This
daring
action
,
however
,
could
not
have
been
accomplished
without
the
assistance
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
warded
off
with
his
rapier
all
the
blows
aimed
at
him
and
his
lovely
charge
.
<EOS>
While
thus
engaged
,
he
received
a
severe
cut
on
the
head
,
which
stretched
him
senseless
and
bleeding
beneath
his
horse
's
feet
.

<EOS>
—
THE
PACKETOn
recovering
from
the
effects
of
the
wound
he
had
received
from
the
trooper
,
Guy
Fawkes
found
himself
stretched
upon
a
small
bed
in
a
cottage
,
with
Viviana
and
Catesby
watching
beside
him
.
<EOS>
A
thick
fold
of
linen
was
bandaged
round
his
head
,
and
he
was
so
faint
from
the
great
effusion
of
blood
he
had
sustained
,
that
,
after
gazing
vacantly
around
him
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
but
imperfectly
comprehending
what
he
beheld
,
his
eyes
closed
,
and
he
relapsed
into
insensibility
.
<EOS>
Restoratives
being
applied
,
he
revived
in
a
short
time
,
and
,
in
answer
to
his
inquiries
how
he
came
thither
,
was
informed
by
Catesby
that
he
had
been
left
for
dead
by
his
assailants
,
who
,
contenting
themselves
with
making
the
old
steward
prisoner
,
had
ridden
off
in
the
direction
of
Chester
.
<EOS>
"What
has
become
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
?
"
asked
the
wounded
man
in
a
feeble
voice
.
<EOS>
Catesby
raised
his
finger
to
his
lips
,
and
Fawkes
learnt
the
distressing
nature
of
the
question
he
had
asked
by
the
agonizing
cry
that
burst
from
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
control
her
grief
,
she
withdrew
,
and
Catesby
then
told
him
that
the
body
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
was
lying
in
an
adjoining
cottage
,
whither
it
had
been
transported
from
the
scene
of
the
conflict
;
adding
that
it
was
Viviana
's
earnest
desire
that
it
should
be
conveyed
to
Manchester
to
the
family
vault
in
the
Collegiate
Church
;
but
that
he
feared
her
wish
could
not
be
safely
complied
with
.
<EOS>
A
messenger
,
however
,
had
been
despatched
to
Holt
;
and
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
and
Fathers
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
,
were
momentarily
expected
,
when
some
course
would
be
decided
upon
for
the
disposal
of
the
unfortunate
knight
's
remains
.
<EOS>
"Poor
Viviana
!
"
groaned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
now
no
protector
.
<EOS>
""Rest
<EOS>
easy
on
that
score
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
She
shall
never
want
one
while
I
live
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
wounded
man
fixed
his
eyes
,
now
blazing
with
red
and
unnatural
light
,
inquiringly
upon
him
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
<EOS>
"I
know
what
you
mean
,
"
continued
Catesby
;
"
you
think
I
shall
we
d
her
,
and
you
are
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
I
shall
.
<EOS>
The
marriage
is
essential
to
our
enterprise
;
and
the
only
obstacle
to
it
is
removed
.
<EOS>
"Fawkes
<EOS>
attempted
to
reply
,
but
his
parched
tongue
refused
its
office
.
<EOS>
Catesby
arose
,
and
carefully
raising
his
head
,
held
a
cup
of
water
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
The
sufferer
eagerly
drained
it
,
and
would
have
asked
for
more
;
but
seeing
that
the
request
would
be
refused
,
he
left
it
unuttered
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
examined
my
wound
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
Catesby
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
do
you
judge
it
mortal
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
that
I
have
any
fear
of
Death
.
<EOS>
I
have
looked
him
in
the
face
too
often
for
that
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
somewhat
on
my
mind
which
I
would
fain
discharge
before
my
earthly
pilgrimage
is
ended
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
delay
it
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
Knowing
I
speak
to
a
soldier
,
and
a
brave
one
,
I
do
not
hesitate
to
tell
you
your
hours
are
numbered
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
's
will
be
done
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
in
a
tone
of
resignation
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
myself
destined
to
be
one
of
the
chief
instruments
of
the
restoration
of
our
holy
religion
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
I
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
When
Father
Garnet
arrives
,
I
beseech
<EOS>
you
let
me
see
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
he
should
not
come
speedily
,
entreat
Miss
Radcliffe
to
grant
me
a
few
moments
in
private
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not
unburthen
yourself
to
me
?
"
returned
Catesby
,
distrustfully
.
<EOS>
"
In
your
circumstances
I
should
desire
no
better
confessor
than
a
brother
soldier,—no
other
crucifix
than
a
sword
-
hilt
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
no
confession
I
am
about
to
make
.
<EOS>
What
I
have
to
say
relates
to
others
,
not
to
myself
.
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Then
there
is
the
more
reason
why
it
should
not
be
deferred
.
<EOS>
I
hold
it
my
duty
to
tell
you
that
the
fever
of
your
wound
will
,
in
all
probability
,
produce
delirium
.
<EOS>
Make
your
communication
while
your
senses
remain
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
whatever
you
enjoin
shall
be
rigorously
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
swear
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Fawkes
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
But
before
an
answer
could
be
returned
,
he
added
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
"
No,—no,—it
can
not
be
.
<EOS>
""This
is
no
time
for
anger
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
sternly
,
"
or
I
should
ask
whether
you
doubt
the
assurance
I
have
given
you?""I
doubt
nothing
but
your
compliance
with
my
request
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
hope
to
be
succoured
at
your
hour
of
need
,
tell
Miss
Radcliffe
<EOS>
I
desire
to
speak
with
her
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
message
will
not
need
to
be
conveyed
,
"
said
Viviana
,
who
had
noiselessly
entered
the
room
;
"
she
is
here
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
turned
his
gaze
in
the
direction
of
the
voice
;
and
,
notwithstanding
his
own
deplorable
condition
,
he
was
filled
with
concern
at
the
change
wrought
in
her
appearance
by
the
terrible
shock
<EOS>
she
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
was
as
pale
as
death,—her
eyes
,
from
which
no
tears
would
flow
,
as
is
ever
the
case
with
the
deepest
distress
,
were
glassy
and
lustreless,—her
luxuriant
hair
hung
in
dishevelled
masses
over
her
shoulders,—and
<EOS>
her
attire
was
soiled
and
disordered
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
desire
to
speak
with
me
<EOS>
,
"
she
continued
,
advancing
towards
the
couch
of
the
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
"It
must
be
alone
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
Viviana
glanced
at
Catesby
,
who
reluctantly
arose
,
and
closed
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
alone
now
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"Water
!
<EOS>
water
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
the
sufferer
,
"
or
I
perish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
request
being
complied
with
<EOS>
,
he
continued
in
a
low
solemn
voice
,
"
Viviana
,
you
have
lost
the
dearest
friend
you
had
on
earth
,
and
you
will
soon
lose
one
who
,
if
he
had
been
spared
,
would
have
endeavoured
,
as
far
as
he
could
,
to
repair
the
loss
.
<EOS>
I
say
not
this
to
aggravate
your
distress
,
but
to
prove
the
sincerity
of
my
regard
.
<EOS>
Let
me
conjure
you
,
with
my
dying
breath
,
not
to
we
d
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
""Fear
<EOS>
it
not
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
endure
death
than
consent
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Be
upon
your
guard
against
him
,
then
,
"
continued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
When
an
object
is
to
be
gained
,
he
suffers
few
scruples
to
stand
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
""I
am
well
aware
of
it
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
and
on
the
arrival
of
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
I
shall
place
myself
under
his
protection
.
<EOS>
""Should
<EOS>
you
be
driven
to
extremity

"
said
Fawkes
,
taking
a
small
packet
from
the
folds
of
his
doublet
,
"
break
open
this
;
it
will
inform
you
what
to
do
.
<EOS>
Only
promise
me
you
will
not
have
recourse
to
it
till
all
other
means
have
failed
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
<EOS>
took
the
packet
,
and
gave
the
required
promise
.
<EOS>
"Conceal
<EOS>
it
about
your
person
,
and
guard
it
carefully
,
"
continued
Fawkes
;
"
for
you
know
not
when
you
may
require
it
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
having
cleared
my
conscience
,
I
can
die
easily
.
<EOS>
Let
me
have
your
prayers
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
<EOS>
knelt
down
by
the
bedside
,
and
poured
forth
the
most
earnest
supplications
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
"Perhaps
<EOS>
,
"
she
said
,
as
she
arose
,
"
and
it
is
some
consolation
to
think
so,—you
may
be
saved
by
death
from
the
commission
of
a
great
crime
,
which
would
for
ever
have
excluded
you
from
the
joys
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
rather
,
"
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
whose
brain
began
to
wander
,
"
which
would
have
secured
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
Others
will
achieve
it
;
but
I
shall
have
no
share
in
their
glory
,
or
their
reward
.
<EOS>
""Their
reward
will
be
perdition
in
this
world
and
in
the
next
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
,
that
though
I
deeply
deplore
your
condition
,
I
rejoice
in
your
delivery
from
this
sin
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
—
far
better
—
to
die
thus
,
than
by
the
hands
of
the
common
executioner
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
do
I
see
?
"
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
trying
to
raise
himself
,
and
sinking
back
again
instantly
upon
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Elizabeth
Orton
rises
before
me
.
<EOS>
She
beckons
me
after
her
—
I
come!—I
come!""Heaven
pity
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
senses
have
left
him!""She
<EOS>
leads
me
into
a
gloomy
cavern
,
"
continued
Fawkes
,
more
wildly
;
"
but
my
eyes
are
like
the
wolf
's
,
and
can
penetrate
the
darkness
.
<EOS>
It
is
filled
with
barrels
of
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
I
see
them
ranged
in
tiers
,
one
above
another
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
know
where
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
vault
beneath
the
Parliament
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
King
and
his
nobles
are
assembled
in
the
hall
above
.
<EOS>
Lend
me
a
torch
,
that
I
may
fire
the
train
,
and
blow
them
into
the
air
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
quick
!
<EOS>
I
have
sworn
their
destruction
,
and
will
keep
my
oath
.
<EOS>
What
matter
if
I
perish
with
them
?
<EOS>
Give
me
the
torch
,
I
say
,
or
it
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
Is
the
powder
damp
that
it
will
not
kindle
?
<EOS>
And
see
!
<EOS>
the
torch
is
expiring
—
it
is
gone
out
!
<EOS>
Distraction!—to
be
baffled
thus
!
<EOS>
Why
do
you
stand
and
glare
at
me
with
your
stony
eyes
?
<EOS>
Who
are
those
with
you
?
<EOS>
Fiends!—no
!
<EOS>
they
are
armed
men
.
<EOS>
They
seize
me
—
they
drag
me
before
a
grave
assemblage
.
<EOS>
What
is
that
hideous
engine
?
<EOS>
The
rack!—Bind
me
on
it
—
break
every
limb
—
ye
shall
not
force
me
to
confess
—
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
laugh
at
your
threats
—
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""Mother
of
mercy
!
<EOS>
release
him
from
this
torture
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"So
!
<EOS>
ye
have
condemned
me
,
"
continued
Fawkes
,
"
and
will
drag
me
to
execution
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
I
am
prepared
.
<EOS>
But
what
a
host
is
assembled
to
see
me
!
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
faces
are
turned
towards
me
,
and
all
with
one
abhorrent
bloodthirsty
expression
.
<EOS>
And
what
a
scaffold
!
<EOS>
Get
it
done
quickly
,
thou
butcherly
villain
.
<EOS>
The
rope
is
twisted
round
my
throat
in
serpent
folds
.
<EOS>
It
strangles
me
—
ah!""Horror
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
listen
to
this
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Help
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
help!""The
knife
is
at
my
breast
—
it
pierces
my
flesh
—
my
heart
is
torn
forth
—
I
die
!
<EOS>
I
die
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
uttered
a
dreadful
groan
.
<EOS>
"What
has
happened
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
rushing
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
dead?""I
fear
so
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
and
his
end
has
been
a
fearful
one
.
<EOS>
""No
—
<EOS>
no
,
"
said
Catesby
;
<EOS>
"
his
pulse
still
beats
—
but
fiercely
and
feverishly
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
not
remain
here
longer
,
Miss
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
I
will
watch
over
him
.
<EOS>
All
will
soon
be
over
.
"Aware
<EOS>
that
she
could
be
of
no
further
use
,
Viviana
cast
a
look
of
the
deepest
commiseration
at
the
sufferer
,
and
retired
.
<EOS>
The
occupant
of
the
cottage
,
an
elderly
female
,
had
surrendered
all
the
apartments
of
her
tenement
,
except
one
small
room
,
to
her
guests
,
and
she
was
therefore
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
The
terrible
event
which
had
recently
occurred
,
and
the
harrowing
scene
she
had
just
witnessed
,
were
too
much
for
Viviana
,
and
her
anguish
was
so
intense
,
that
she
began
to
fear
her
reason
was
deserting
her
.
<EOS>
She
stood
still,—gazed
fearfully
round
,
as
if
some
secret
danger
environed
her,—clasped
her
hands
to
her
temples
,
and
found
them
burning
like
hot
iron,—and
,
then
,
alarmed
at
her
own
state
,
knelt
down
,
prayed
,
and
wept
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
she
wept
,
for
the
first
time
,
since
her
father
's
destruction
,
and
the
relief
afforded
by
those
scalding
tears
was
inexpressible
.
<EOS>
From
this
piteous
state
she
was
aroused
by
the
tramp
of
horses
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
,
and
the
next
moment
Father
Garnet
presented
himself
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
uncertain
are
human
affairs
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
a
sorrowful
greeting
had
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
"
I
little
thought
,
when
we
parted
yesterday
,
we
should
meet
again
so
soon
,
and
under
such
afflicting
circumstances
.
<EOS>
""It
is
the
will
of
Heaven
,
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
and
we
must
not
murmur
at
its
decrees
,
but
bear
our
chastening
as
we
best
may
.
<EOS>
""I
am
happy
to
find
you
in
such
a
comfortable
frame
of
mind
,
dear
daughter
.
<EOS>
I
feared
the
effect
of
the
shock
upon
your
feelings
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
glad
to
find
you
bear
up
against
it
<EOS>
so
well
.
<EOS>
""I
am
surprised
at
my
own
firmness
,
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
been
schooled
in
affliction
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
tie
left
to
bind
me
to
the
world
,
and
shall
retire
from
it
,
not
only
without
regret
,
but
with
eagerness
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
not
so
,
dear
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
,
I
trust
,
much
happiness
in
store
for
you
;
and
when
the
sharpness
of
your
affliction
is
worn
off
,
you
will
view
your
condition
in
a
more
cheering
light
.
""Impossible
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
mournfully
.
<EOS>
"
Hope
is
wholly
extinct
in
my
breast
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
contest
the
point
.
<EOS>
Is
not
Sir
Everard
Digby
with
you?""He
is
not
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
"
and
I
will
explain
to
you
wherefore
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
your
departure
yesterday
,
the
mansion
we
occupied
at
Holt
was
attacked
by
a
band
of
soldiers
,
headed
by
Miles
Topcliffe
,
one
of
the
most
unrelenting
of
our
persecutors
;
and
though
they
were
driven
off
with
some
loss
,
yet
,
as
there
was
every
reason
to
apprehend
,
they
would
return
with
fresh
force
,
Sir
Everard
judged
it
prudent
to
retreat
;
and
accordingly
he
and
his
friends
,
with
all
their
attendants
,
except
those
he
has
sent
with
me
,
have
departed
for
Buckinghamshire
.
<EOS>
""Where
,
then
,
is
Father
Oldcorne
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
daughter
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
"
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
he
is
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Imprudently
exposing
himself
during
the
attack
,
he
was
seized
and
carried
off
by
Topcliffe
and
his
myrmidons
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
true
is
the
saying
that
misfortunes
never
come
single
!
"
<EOS>
sighed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
seem
bereft
of
all
I
hold
dear
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
Everard
has
sent
four
of
his
trustiest
servants
with
me
,
"
remarked
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
well
armed
,
and
will
attend
you
wherever
you
choose
to
lead
them
.
<EOS>
He
has
also
furnished
me
with
a
sum
of
money
for
your
use
.
<EOS>
""He
is
most
kind
and
considerate
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
father
,
"
she
faltered
,
"
there
is
one
subject
which
it
is
necessary
to
speak
upon
;
and
,
though
I
shrink
from
it
,
it
must
not
be
postponed
.
<EOS>
""I
guess
what
you
mean
,
daughter
,
"
said
Garnet
,
sympathizingly
;
"
you
allude
to
the
interment
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
Is
the
body
here?""It
<EOS>
is
in
an
adjoining
cottage
,
"
replied
Viviana
in
a
broken
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
expressed
my
wish
to
Mr.
Catesby
to
have
it
conveyed
to
Manchester
,
to
our
family
vault
.
<EOS>
""I
see
not
how
that
can
be
accomplished
,
dear
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
but
I
will
confer
with
Mr.
Catesby
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Where
is
he?""In
the
next
room
,
by
the
couch
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
is
dying
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Dying
!
"
echoed
Garnet
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
he
was
dangerously
hurt
,
but
did
not
suppose
the
wound
would
prove
fatal
.
<EOS>
Here
is
another
grievous
blow
to
the
good
cause
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
the
door
was
opened
by
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
is
the
sufferer
?
"
asked
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
slight
change
for
the
better
appears
to
have
taken
place
,
"
answered
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
fever
has
in
some
decree
abated
,
and
he
has
sunk
into
a
gentle
slumber
.
<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
he
be
removed
with
safety
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Garnet
<EOS>
;
"
for
,
I
fear
,
if
he
remains
here
,
he
will
fall
into
the
hands
of
Topcliffe
and
his
crew
,
who
are
scouring
the
country
in
every
direction
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
recapitulated
all
he
had
just
stated
to
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Catesby
was
for
some
time
lost
in
reflection
.
<EOS>
"I
am
fairly
perplexed
as
to
what
course
it
will
be
best
to
pursue
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Dangers
and
difficulties
beset
us
on
every
side
.
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
yield
to
Viviana
's
request
,
and
proceed
to
Manchester
.
<EOS>
""That
will
be
rushing
into
the
very
face
of
danger
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"And
,
therefore
,
may
be
the
safest
plan
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Our
adversaries
will
scarcely
suspect
us
of
so
desperate
a
step
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
you
are
in
the
right
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
.
<EOS>
"
At
all
events
,
I
bow
to
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
plan
is
too
much
in
accordance
with
my
own
wishes
to
meet
with
any
opposition
on
my
part
,
"
observed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
accompany
us
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Catesby
;
"
or
do
you
proceed
to
Gothurst?""I
will
go
with
you
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
Viviana
will
need
a
protector
.
<EOS>
And
,
till
I
have
seen
her
in
some
place
of
safety
,
I
will
not
leave
her
.
<EOS>
""Since
we
have
come
to
this
determination
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
as
soon
as
the
needful
preparations
can
be
made
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
has
had
some
hours
'
repose
,
we
will
set
out
.
<EOS>
Under
cover
of
night
we
can
travel
with
security
;
and
,
by
using
some
exertion
,
may
reach
Ordsall
Hall
,
whither
<EOS>
,
I
presume
,
Viviana
would
choose
to
proceed
,
in
the
first
instance
,
before
daybreak
.
<EOS>
""I
am
well
mounted
,
and
so
are
my
attendants
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
and
,
by
the
provident
care
of
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
each
of
them
has
a
led
horse
with
him
.
<EOS>
""That
is
well
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
Viviana
,
may
I
entreat
you
to
take
my
place
for
a
short
time
by
the
couch
of
the
sufferer
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
hours
everything
shall
be
in
readiness
.
"He
<EOS>
then
retired
with
Garnet
,
while
Viviana
proceeded
to
the
adjoining
chamber
,
where
she
found
Guy
Fawkes
still
slumbering
tranquilly
.
<EOS>
As
the
evening
advanced
,
he
awoke
,
and
appeared
much
refreshed
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
speaking
,
Garnet
and
Catesby
approached
his
bedside
,
and
he
seemed
overjoyed
at
the
sight
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
The
subject
of
the
journey
being
mentioned
to
him
,
he
at
once
expressed
his
ready
compliance
with
the
arrangement
,
and
only
desired
that
the
last
rites
of
his
church
might
be
performed
for
him
before
he
set
out
.
<EOS>
Garnet
informed
him
that
he
had
come
for
that
very
purpose
;
and
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone
,
he
proceeded
to
the
discharge
of
his
priestly
duties
,
confessed
and
absolved
him
,
giving
him
the
viaticum
and
the
extreme
unction
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
he
judged
it
expedient
to
administer
a
powerful
opiate
,
to
lull
the
pain
of
his
wound
on
the
journey
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
summoned
Catesby
,
who
,
with
two
of
the
attendants
,
raised
the
couch
on
which
the
wounded
man
was
stretched
,
and
conveyed
him
to
the
litter
.
<EOS>
So
well
was
this
managed
,
that
Fawkes
sustained
no
injury
,
and
little
inconvenience
,
from
the
movement
.
<EOS>
Two
strong
country
vehicles
had
been
procured
;
the
one
containing
the
wounded
man
's
litter
,
the
other
the
shell
,
which
had
been
hastily
put
together
,
to
hold
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
Viviana
being
placed
in
the
saddle
,
and
Catesby
having
liberally
rewarded
the
cottagers
who
had
afforded
them
shelter
,
the
little
cavalcade
was
put
in
motion
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
journeyed
through
the
night
;
and
shaping
their
course
through
Tarporley
,
Northwich
,
and
Altringham
,
arrived
at
daybreak
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Ordsall
Hall
.

<EOS>
—
THE
ELIXIROn
beholding
the
well
-
remembered
roof
and
gables
of
the
old
mansion
peeping
from
out
the
grove
of
trees
in
which
it
was
embosomed
,
Viviana
's
heart
died
away
within
her
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
her
father
,
who
had
so
recently
quitted
it
in
the
full
enjoyment
of
health
,
and
of
every
worldly
blessing
,
should
be
so
soon
brought
back
a
corpse
,
was
almost
too
agonizing
for
endurance
.
<EOS>
Reflecting
,
however
,
that
this
was
no
season
for
the
indulgence
of
grief
,
but
that
she
was
called
upon
to
act
with
firmness
,
she
bore
up
resolutely
against
her
emotion
.
<EOS>
Arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
Hall
,
Catesby
caused
the
little
train
to
halt
under
the
shelter
of
the
trees
,
while
he
rode
forward
to
ascertain
that
they
could
safely
approach
it
.
<EOS>
As
he
drew
near
,
everything
proclaimed
that
the
hand
of
the
spoiler
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
drawbridge
,
he
entered
the
court
,
which
bore
abundant
marks
of
the
devastation
recently
committed
.
<EOS>
Various
articles
of
furniture
,
broken
,
burnt
,
or
otherwise
destroyed
,
were
lying
scattered
about
.
<EOS>
The
glass
in
the
windows
was
shivered
;
the
doors
forced
from
their
hinges
;
the
stone
-
copings
of
the
walls
pushed
off
;
the
flower
-
beds
trampled
upon
;
the
moat
itself
was
in
some
places
choked
up
with
rubbish
,
while
in
others
its
surface
was
covered
with
floating
pieces
of
timber
.
<EOS>
Led
by
curiosity
Catesby
proceeded
to
the
spot
where
the
stables
had
stood
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
a
heap
of
blackened
ruins
met
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
one
stone
was
standing
on
another
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
place
was
so
desolate
and
disheartening
,
that
he
turned
away
instantly
.
<EOS>
Leaving
his
horse
in
a
shed
,
he
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
Here
,
again
,
he
encountered
fresh
ravages
.
<EOS>
The
oak
-
panels
and
skirting
-
boards
were
torn
from
the
walls
;
the
ceilings
pulled
down
;
and
the
floor
lay
inch
-
deep
in
broken
plaster
and
dust
.
<EOS>
On
ascending
to
the
upper
rooms
,
he
found
the
same
disorder
.
<EOS>
The
banisters
of
the
stairs
were
broken
;
the
bedsteads
destroyed
;
the
roof
partially
untiled
.
<EOS>
Every
room
was
thickly
strewn
with
leaves
torn
from
valuable
books
,
with
fragments
of
apparel
,
and
other
articles
,
which
the
searchers
not
being
able
to
carry
off
had
wantonly
destroyed
.
<EOS>
Having
contemplated
this
scene
of
havoc
for
some
time
,
with
feelings
of
the
bitterest
indignation
,
Catesby
descended
to
the
lowest
story
;
and
,
after
searching
ineffectually
for
the
domestics
,
was
about
to
depart
,
when
,
turning
suddenly
,
he
perceived
a
man
watching
him
from
an
adjoining
room
.
<EOS>
Catesby
instantly
called
to
him
;
but
,
seeing
that
the
fellow
disregarded
his
assurances
,
and
was
about
to
take
to
his
heels
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
threatened
him
with
severe
punishment
if
he
attempted
to
fly
.
<EOS>
Thus
exhorted
,
the
man
—
who
was
no
other
than
the
younger
Heydocke
—
advanced
towards
him
;
and
throwing
himself
at
his
feet
,
begged
him
in
the
most
piteous
terms
to
do
him
no
injury
.
<EOS>
"I
have
already
told
you
I
am
a
friend
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
sheathing
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Catesby
,
is
it
you
I
behold
?
"
cried
Martin
Heydocke
,
whose
fears
had
hitherto
prevented
him
from
noticing
the
features
of
the
intruder
.
<EOS>
"
What
brings
your
worship
to
this
ill
-
fated
house?""First
let
me
know
if
there
is
any
enemy
about
?
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"None
that
I
am
aware
of
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Martin
.
"
<EOS>
Having
ransacked
the
premises
,
and
done
all
the
mischief
they
could
,
as
you
perceive
,
the
miscreants
departed
the
day
before
yesterday
,
and
I
have
seen
nothing
of
them
since
,
though
I
have
been
constantly
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
The
only
alarm
I
have
had
was
that
occasioned
by
your
worship
just
now
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
alone
here
?
"
demanded
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"No
,
your
worship
,
"
answered
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
several
of
the
servants
concealed
in
a
secret
passage
under
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
they
are
so
terrified
by
what
has
lately
happened
,
that
they
never
dare
show
themselves
,
except
during
the
night
-
time
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
wonder
at
it
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
may
I
inquire
whether
your
worship
brings
any
tidings
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
and
Mistress
Viviana
?
"
rejoined
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
no
ill
has
befallen
them
.
<EOS>
My
father
,
old
Jerome
Heydocke
,
set
out
to
Holywell
a
few
days
ago
,
to
apprise
them
of
their
danger
,
and
I
have
not
heard
of
them
since
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
William
Radcliffe
is
dead
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
The
villains
have
murdered
him
.
<EOS>
Your
father
is
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
young
man
,
bursting
into
tears
;
"
these
are
fearful
times
to
live
in
.
<EOS>
What
will
become
of
us
all?""We
must
rise
against
the
oppressor
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Bite
the
heel
that
tramples
upon
us
.
<EOS>
""We
must
,
"
rejoined
Martin
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
my
poor
arm
could
avail
,
it
should
not
be
slow
to
strike
.
<EOS>
""Manfully
resolved
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
who
never
lost
an
opportunity
of
gaining
a
proselyte
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
point
out
to
you
a
way
by
which
you
may
accomplish
what
you
desire
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
talk
of
this
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Hoard
up
your
vengeance
till
the
fitting
moment
for
action
arrives
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
proceeded
to
explain
to
the
young
man
,
who
was
greatly
surprised
by
the
intelligence
,
that
Viviana
was
at
hand
,
and
that
the
body
of
Sir
William
had
been
brought
thither
for
interment
in
the
family
vault
at
the
Collegiate
Church
.
<EOS>
Having
ascertained
that
there
was
a
chamber
,
which
,
having
suffered
less
than
the
others
,
might
serve
for
Viviana
's
accommodation
,
Catesby
returned
to
the
party
.
<EOS>
A
more
melancholy
cavalcade
has
been
seldom
seen
than
now
approached
the
gates
of
Ordsall
Hall
.
<EOS>
First
rode
Viviana
,
in
an
agony
of
tears
,
for
her
grief
had
by
this
time
become
absolutely
uncontrollable
,
with
Catesby
on
foot
,
leading
her
horse
.
<EOS>
Next
came
Garnet
,
greatly
exhausted
and
depressed
;
his
eyes
cast
dejectedly
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
litter
,
containing
Guy
Fawkes
;
and
,
lastly
,
the
vehicle
with
the
body
of
Sir
William
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
gate
,
Viviana
was
met
by
two
female
servants
,
whom
Martin
Heydocke
had
summoned
from
their
hiding
-
places
;
and
,
as
soon
as
she
had
dismounted
,
she
was
supported
,
for
she
was
scarcely
able
to
walk
unaided
,
to
the
chamber
destined
for
her
reception
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Catesby
proceeded
,
with
some
anxiety
,
to
superintend
the
removal
of
Fawkes
,
who
was
perfectly
insensible
.
<EOS>
His
wound
had
bled
considerably
during
the
journey
;
but
the
effusion
had
stopped
when
the
faintness
supervened
.
<EOS>
He
was
placed
in
one
of
the
lower
rooms
till
a
sleeping
-
chamber
could
be
prepared
for
him
.
<EOS>
The
last
task
was
to
attend
to
the
remains
of
the
late
unfortunate
possessor
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
By
Catesby
's
directions
a
large
oak
table
,
once
occupying
the
great
hall
,
was
removed
to
the
Star
Chamber
,
already
described
as
the
principal
room
of
the
house
;
and
,
being
securely
propped
up,—for
,
like
the
rest
of
the
furniture
,
it
had
been
much
damaged
by
the
spoilers
,
though
,
being
of
substantial
material
,
it
offered
greater
resistance
to
their
efforts,—the
shell
containing
the
body
was
placed
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"Better
<EOS>
he
should
lie
thus
,
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
when
the
melancholy
office
was
completed
,
"
than
live
to
witness
the
wreck
around
him
.
<EOS>
Fatal
as
are
these
occurrences
,
"
he
added
,
pursuing
the
train
of
thought
suggested
by
the
scene
,
"
they
are
yet
favourable
to
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
only
person
who
could
have
prevented
my
union
with
Viviana
Radcliffe
—
her
father
—
lies
there
.
<EOS>
Who
would
have
thought
when
she
rejected
my
proposal
a
few
days
ago
,
in
this
very
room
,
how
fortune
would
conspire
—
and
by
what
dark
and
inscrutable
means
—
to
bring
it
about
!
<EOS>
Fallen
as
it
is
,
this
house
is
not
yet
fallen
so
low
,
but
I
can
reinstate
it
.
<EOS>
Its
young
mistress
mine
,
her
estates
<EOS>
mine,—for
<EOS>
she
is
now
inheritress
of
all
her
father
's
possessions,—the
utmost
reach
of
my
ambition
were
gained
,
and
all
but
one
object
of
my
life
—
for
which
I
have
dared
so
much
,
and
struggled
so
long
—
<EOS>
achieved!""What
<EOS>
are
you
thinking
of
,
my
son
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Garnet
,
who
had
watched
the
changing
expression
of
his
sombre
<EOS>
countenance,—"what
are
you
thinking
of
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Of
<EOS>
that
which
is
never
absent
from
my
thoughts
,
father
—
the
great
design
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
and
of
the
means
of
its
accomplishment
,
which
this
sad
scene
suggests
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
understand
you
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Does
<EOS>
not
Radcliffe
's
blood
cry
aloud
for
vengeance
?
<EOS>
"
continued
Catesby
;
"
and
think
you
his
child
will
be
deaf
to
the
cry
?
<EOS>
No
,
father
,
she
will
no
longer
tamely
submit
to
wrongs
that
would
steel
the
gentlest
bosom
,
and
make
firm
the
feeblest
arm
,
but
will
go
hand
and
heart
with
us
in
our
project
.
<EOS>
Viviana
must
be
mine
,
"
he
added
,
altering
his
tone
,
"
ours
,
I
should
say,—for
,
if
she
is
mine
,
all
the
vast
possessions
that
have
accrued
to
her
by
her
father
's
death
shall
be
devoted
to
the
furtherance
of
the
mighty
enterprise
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
think
she
will
refuse
you
now
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
"She
<EOS>
shall
not
refuse
me
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
The
time
is
gone
by
for
idle
wooing
.
<EOS>
""I
will
be
no
party
to
forcible
measures
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"
As
far
as
persuasion
goes
,
I
will
lend
you
every
assistance
in
my
power
,
but
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
""Persuasion
is
all
that
will
be
required
,
I
am
assured
,
father
,
"
answered
Catesby
,
hastily
,
perceiving
he
had
committed
himself
too
far
.
"
<EOS>
But
let
us
now
see
what
can
be
done
for
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>
there
was
any
hope
of
his
life
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Garnet
,
sighing
deeply
.
"
<EOS>
In
losing
him
,
we
lose
the
bravest
of
our
band
.
<EOS>
""We
do
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
he
has
been
subject
to
strange
fancies
of
late
.
<EOS>
""He
has
been
appalled
,
but
never
shaken
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
Of
all
our
number
,
you
and
he
were
the
only
two
upon
whom
I
could
rely
.
<EOS>
When
he
is
gone
,
you
will
stand
alone
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
made
no
reply
,
but
led
the
way
to
the
chamber
where
the
wounded
man
lay
.
<EOS>
He
had
regained
his
consciousness
,
but
was
too
feeble
to
speak
.
<EOS>
After
such
restoratives
as
were
at
hand
had
been
administered
,
Catesby
was
about
to
order
a
room
to
be
fitted
up
for
him
,
when
Viviana
,
whose
anxiety
for
the
sufferer
had
overcome
her
affliction
,
made
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
On
learning
Catesby
's
intentions
,
she
insisted
upon
Fawkes
being
removed
to
the
room
allotted
to
her
,
which
had
not
been
dismantled
like
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Seeing
it
was
in
vain
to
oppose
her
,
Catesby
assented
,
and
the
sufferer
was
accordingly
carried
thither
,
and
placed
within
the
bed
—
a
large
antique
piece
of
furniture
,
hung
with
faded
damask
curtains
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
one
of
the
oldest
in
the
house
,
and
at
the
further
end
stood
a
small
closet
,
approached
by
an
arched
doorway
,
and
fitted
up
with
a
hassock
and
crucifix
,
which
,
strange
to
say
,
had
escaped
the
ravages
of
the
searchers
.
<EOS>
Placed
within
the
couch
,
Guy
Fawkes
began
to
ramble
as
before
about
the
conspiracy
;
and
fearing
his
ravings
might
awaken
the
suspicion
of
the
servants
,
Catesby
would
not
suffer
any
of
them
to
come
near
him
,
but
arranged
with
Garnet
to
keep
watch
over
him
by
turns
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
he
became
more
composed
;
and
,
after
dozing
a
little
,
opened
his
eyes
,
and
,
looking
round
,
inquired
anxiously
for
his
sword
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
Catesby
,
who
was
alone
with
him
at
the
time
,
hesitated
in
his
answer
,
but
seeing
he
appeared
greatly
disturbed
,
he
showed
him
that
his
hat
,
gauntlets
,
and
rapier
were
lying
by
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
"I
am
content
,
"
replied
the
wounded
man
,
smiling
faintly
;
"
that
sword
has
never
left
my
side
,
waking
or
sleeping
,
for
twenty
years
.
<EOS>
Let
me
grasp
it
once
more
—
perhaps
for
the
last
time
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
handed
him
the
weapon
.
<EOS>
He
looked
at
it
for
a
few
moments
,
and
pressed
the
blade
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"Farewell
,
old
friend
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
a
tear
gathering
in
his
eye
,
"
farewell
!
<EOS>
Catesby
,
"
he
added
,
as
he
resigned
the
weapon
to
him
,
"
I
have
one
request
to
make
.
<EOS>
Let
my
sword
be
buried
with
me
.
<EOS>
""It
<EOS>
shall
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
in
a
voice
suffocated
by
emotion
,
for
the
request
<EOS>
touched
him
where
his
stern
nature
was
most
accessible
:
"
I
will
place
it
by
you
myself
.
""Thanks
!
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
And
soon
after
this
,
he
again
fell
into
a
slumber
.
<EOS>
His
sleep
endured
for
some
hours
;
but
his
breathing
grew
fainter
and
fainter
,
so
that
at
the
last
it
was
scarcely
perceptible
.
<EOS>
A
striking
change
had
likewise
taken
place
in
his
countenance
,
and
these
signs
convinced
Catesby
<EOS>
he
had
not
long
to
live
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
watching
him
with
great
anxiety
,
Viviana
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
chamber
,
and
beckoned
him
out
.
<EOS>
Noiselessly
obeying
the
summons
,
and
following
her
along
the
gallery
,
he
entered
a
room
where
he
found
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"I
have
called
you
to
say
that
a
remedy
has
been
suggested
to
me
by
Martin
Heydocke
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
"
<EOS>
by
which
I
trust
Guy
Fawkes
may
yet
be
saved
.
<EOS>
""How
?
"
asked
Catesby
,
eagerly
.
"Doctor
<EOS>
Dee
,
the
warden
of
Manchester
,
of
whom
you
must
have
heard
,
"
she
continued
,
"
is
said
to
possess
an
elixir
of
such
virtue
,
that
a
few
drops
of
it
will
snatch
him
who
drinks
them
from
the
very
jaws
of
death
.
<EOS>
""I
should
not
have
suspected
you
of
so
much
credulity
,
Viviana
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
grant
that
Doctor
Dee
possesses
this
marvellous
elixir
—
which
for
my
own
part
I
doubt
—
how
are
we
to
obtain
it?""If
you
will
repair
to
the
college
,
and
see
him
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
he
will
give
it
you
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Catesby
smiled
incredulously
.
<EOS>
"I
have
a
claim
upon
Doctor
Dee
,
"
she
persisted
,
"
which
I
have
never
enforced
.
<EOS>
I
will
now
use
it
.
<EOS>
Show
him
this
token
,
"
she
continued
,
detaching
a
small
ornament
from
her
neck
;
"
tell
him
you
bring
it
from
me
,
and
I
am
sure
he
will
comply
with
your
request
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
commands
shall
be
obeyed
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
I
frankly
confess
I
have
no
faith
in
the
remedy
.
<EOS>
""It
is
at
least
worth
the
trial
,
my
son
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
is
a
wonderful
person
,
and
has
made
many
discoveries
in
medicine
,
as
in
other
sciences
,
and
this
marvellous
specific
may
,
for
aught
we
know
,
turn
out
no
imposture
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
such
is
your
opinion
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
I
will
set
out
at
once
.
<EOS>
If
it
is
to
be
tried
at
all
,
it
must
be
without
delay
.
<EOS>
The
poor
sufferer
is
sinking
fast
.
<EOS>
""Go
<EOS>
then
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
"
and
heaven
speed
your
mission
!
<EOS>
If
you
could
prevail
upon
Doctor
Dee
to
visit
the
wounded
man
in
person
,
I
should
prefer
it
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
have
another
request
to
make
of
him
—
but
that
will
do
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Lose
not
a
moment
now
.
<EOS>
""I
will
fly
on
the
wings
of
the
wind
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
that
when
I
return
the
object
of
our
solicitude
may
not
be
past
all
human
aid!"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
hurried
to
an
out
-
building
in
which
the
horses
were
placed
,
and
choosing
the
strongest
and
fleetest
from
out
their
number
,
mounted
,
and
started
at
full
gallop
in
the
direction
of
Manchester
;
nor
did
he
relax
his
speed
until
he
reached
the
gates
of
the
ancient
College
.
<EOS>
Hanging
the
bridle
of
his
smoking
steed
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
,
he
crossed
the
large
quadrangular
court
;
and
finding
the
principal
entrance
open
,
passed
the
lofty
room
now
used
as
the
refectory
,
ascended
the
flight
of
stone
stairs
that
conducts
the
modern
visitor
to
the
library
,
and
was
traversing
the
long
galleries
communicating
with
it
,
and
now
crowded
with
the
learning
of
ages
,
bequeathed
by
the
benevolence
of
his
rival
,
Humphrey
Chetham
,
when
he
encountered
a
grave
but
crafty
-
looking
personage
,
in
a
loose
brown
robe
and
Polish
cap
,
who
angrily
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
Apologizing
for
the
intrusion
,
Catesby
was
about
to
explain
,
when
a
small
oak
door
near
them
was
partly
opened
,
and
an
authoritative
voice
,
from
within
,
exclaimed
,
"
Do
not
hinder
him
,
Kelley
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
business
,
and
will
see
him
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
seer
made
no
further
remark
,
but
pointing
to
the
door
,
Catesby
at
once
comprehended
that
it
was
Dee
's
voice
he
had
heard
;
and
,
though
somewhat
startled
by
the
intimation
that
he
was
expected
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
Doctor
surrounded
by
his
magical
apparatus
,
and
slowly
returning
to
the
chair
he
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
Without
looking
behind
him
to
see
whom
he
addressed
,
Dee
continued
,
"
I
have
just
consulted
my
show
-
stone
,
and
know
why
you
are
come
hither
.
<EOS>
You
bring
a
token
from
Viviana
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
in
increased
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
here
.
<EOS>
""It
is
needless
to
produce
it
,
"
replied
Dee
,
still
keeping
his
back
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
it
already
.
<EOS>
Kelley
,
"
he
continued
,
"
I
am
about
to
set
out
for
Ordsall
Hall
immediately
.
<EOS>
You
must
accompany
me
.
""Amazement
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Is
the
purpose
of
my
visit
then
really
known
to
your
reverence?""You
shall
hear
,
"
rejoined
Dee
,
facing
him
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
friend
who
is
at
the
point
of
death
,
and
having
heard
that
I
possess
an
elixir
of
wonderful
efficacy
,
are
come
in
quest
of
it
.
<EOS>
""True
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
utterly
confounded
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
name
of
that
friend
,
"
pursued
Dee
,
regarding
him
fixedly
,
"
is
Guy
Fawkes,—your
own
,
Robert
Catesby
.
<EOS>
""I
need
no
more
to
convince
me
,
reverend
sir
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
trembling
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
"
that
all
I
have
heard
of
your
wonderful
powers
falls
far
short
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
""You
are
but
just
in
time
,
"
replied
Dee
,
bowing
gravely
,
in
acknowledgment
of
the
compliment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Another
hour
,
and
it
would
have
been
too
late
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
think
he
will
live
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sure
of
it
,
"
replied
Dee
,
"
provided——""Provided
what
?
"
interrupted
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Is
there
aught
I
can
do
to
ensure
his
recovery?""No
,
"
replied
Dee
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
debating
within
myself
whether
it
is
worth
while
reviving
him
for
a
more
dreadful
fate
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
reverend
sir
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Catesby
,
a
shade
passing
over
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
"You
understand
my
meaning
,
and
therefore
need
no
explanation
,
"
replied
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
Return
to
Ordsall
Hall
,
and
tell
Miss
Radcliffe
I
will
be
there
in
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Bid
her
have
no
further
fear
.
<EOS>
If
the
wounded
man
breathes
when
I
arrive
,
I
will
undertake
to
cure
him
.
<EOS>
Add
further
,
that
I
know
the
other
request
she
desires
to
make
of
me
,
and
that
it
is
granted
before
it
is
asked
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
sir
,
for
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
"On
reaching
the
court
,
Catesby
expanded
his
chest
,
shook
his
limbs
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
At
length
,
I
breathe
freely
.
<EOS>
The
atmosphere
of
that
infernal
chamber
smelt
so
horribly
of
sulphur
that
it
almost
stifled
me
.
<EOS>
Well
,
if
Doctor
Dee
has
not
dealings
with
the
devil
,
man
never
had
!
<EOS>
However
,
if
he
cures
Guy
Fawkes
,
I
care
not
whence
the
medicine
comes
from
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
descended
Smithy
Bank
,
and
was
about
to
cross
the
old
bridge
over
the
Irwell
,
he
perceived
a
man
riding
before
him
,
who
seemed
anxious
to
avoid
him
.
<EOS>
Struck
by
this
person
's
manner
,
he
urged
his
horse
into
a
quicker
pace
,
and
being
better
mounted
of
the
two
,
soon
overtook
him
,
when
to
his
surprise
he
found
it
was
Martin
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
are
you
doing
here
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"I
have
been
sent
by
Mistress
Viviana
with
a
message
to
Mr.
Humphrey
Chetham
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
in
great
confusion
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
And
how
dared
you
convey
a
message
to
him
,
without
consulting
me
on
the
subject?""I
<EOS>
was
not
aware
you
were
my
master
,
"
replied
Martin
,
sulkily
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
owe
obedience
to
any
one
,
it
is
to
Mr.
Chetham
,
whose
servant
I
am
.
<EOS>
But
if
Mistress
Viviana
gives
me
a
message
to
deliver
,
I
will
execute
her
commands
,
whoever
may
be
pleased
or
displeased
.
<EOS>
""I
did
but
jest
,
thou
saucy
knave
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
who
did
not
desire
to
offend
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
is
a
piece
of
money
for
thee
.
<EOS>
Now
,
if
it
be
no
secret
,
what
was
Miss
Radcliffe
's
message
to
thy
master?""I
<EOS>
know
not
what
her
letter
contained
,
"
replied
Martin
;
"
but
his
answer
was
,
that
he
would
come
to
the
hall
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
<EOS>
I
ascertained
this
,
"
thought
Catesby
,
and
he
added
aloud
,
"
I
understood
your
master
had
been
arrested
and
imprisoned
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
he
was
,
"
replied
Martin
;
"
but
he
had
interest
enough
with
the
Commissioners
to
procure
his
liberation
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
and
striking
spurs
into
his
charger
,
he
dashed
off
.
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
's
hard
riding
brought
him
to
the
hall
,
and
,
on
arriving
there
,
he
proceeded
at
once
to
the
wounded
man
's
chamber
,
where
he
found
Viviana
and
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
succeeded
in
your
errand
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
former
,
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
Will
Doctor
Dee
come
,
or
has
he
sent
the
elixir?""He
<EOS>
will
bring
it
himself
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Viviana
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
,
and
the
sound
appeared
to
reach
the
ears
of
the
sufferer
,
for
he
stirred
,
and
groaned
faintly
.
<EOS>
"Doctor
<EOS>
Dee
desired
me
to
tell
you
,
"
continued
Catesby
,
drawing
Viviana
aside
,
and
speaking
in
a
low
tone
,
"
that
your
other
request
was
granted
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
looked
surprised
,
and
as
if
she
did
not
clearly
understand
him
.
<EOS>
"Might
<EOS>
he
not
refer
to
Humphrey
Chetham
?
"
remarked
Catesby
,
somewhat
maliciously
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
you
have
learnt
from
Martin
Heydocke
that
I
have
written
to
him
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
blushing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
was
about
to
ask
of
Doctor
Dee
had
no
reference
to
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
request
permission
to
privately
inter
my
father
's
remains
in
our
family
vault
in
the
Collegiate
Church
.
<EOS>
But
how
did
he
know
I
had
any
request
to
make?""That
passes
my
comprehension
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
unless
he
obtained
his
information
from
his
familiar
spirits
.
<EOS>
"Shortly
<EOS>
after
this
,
Dr.
Dee
and
Kelley
arrived
at
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Catesby
met
them
at
the
gate
,
and
conducted
them
to
the
wounded
man
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Coldly
saluting
Garnet
,
whom
he
eyed
with
suspicion
,
and
bowing
respectfully
to
Viviana
,
the
Doctor
slowly
advanced
to
the
bedside
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
for
a
short
time
at
the
wounded
man
,
and
folded
his
arms
thoughtfully
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
The
eyes
of
the
sufferer
were
closed
,
and
his
lips
slightly
apart
,
but
no
breath
seemed
to
issue
from
them
.
<EOS>
His
bronzed
complexion
had
assumed
the
ghastly
hue
of
death
,
and
his
strongly
-
marked
features
had
become
fixed
and
rigid
.
<EOS>
His
black
hair
,
stiffened
and
caked
with
blood
,
escaped
from
the
bandages
around
his
head
,
and
hung
in
elf
locks
on
the
pillow
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
piteous
spectacle
;
and
Doctor
Dee
appeared
much
moved
by
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
worst
is
over
,
"
he
muttered
:
"
why
recall
the
spirit
to
its
wretched
tenement?""If
you
can
save
him
,
reverend
sir
,
do
not
hesitate
,
"
implored
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
come
hither
for
that
purpose
,
"
replied
Dee
;
"
but
I
must
have
no
other
witness
to
the
experiment
except
yourself
,
and
my
attendant
Kelley
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
desire
to
be
present
,
reverend
sir
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Viviana
;
"
but
I
will
retire
into
that
closet
,
and
pray
that
your
remedy
may
prevail
.
<EOS>
""My
prayers
for
the
same
end
shall
be
offered
in
the
adjoining
room
,
"
observed
Garnet
;
and
taking
Catesby
's
arm
,
who
seemed
spell
-
bound
by
curiosity
,
he
dragged
him
away
.
<EOS>
The
door
closed
,
and
Viviana
withdrew
into
the
closet
,
where
she
knelt
down
before
the
crucifix
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
seated
himself
on
the
bedside
;
and
taking
a
gourd
-
shaped
bottle
,
filled
with
a
clear
sparkling
liquid
,
from
beneath
his
robe
,
he
raised
it
to
his
eyes
with
his
left
hand
,
while
he
placed
his
right
on
the
wrist
of
the
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
he
continued
for
a
few
seconds
,
while
Kelley
,
with
his
arms
folded
,
likewise
kept
his
gaze
fixed
on
the
phial
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
Dee
,
who
had
apparently
counted
the
pulsations
of
the
sufferer
,
took
out
the
glass
stopper
from
the
bottle
,
the
contents
of
which
diffused
a
pungent
odour
around
;
and
wetting
a
small
piece
of
linen
with
it
,
applied
it
to
his
temples
.
<EOS>
He
then
desired
Kelley
to
raise
his
head
,
and
poured
a
few
drops
down
his
throat
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
waited
a
few
minutes
,
and
repeated
the
application
.
<EOS>
"Look
!
"
he
cried
to
Kelley
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
elixir
already
begins
to
operate
.
<EOS>
His
chest
heaves
.
<EOS>
His
limbs
shiver
.
<EOS>
That
flush
upon
the
cheek
,
and
that
dampness
upon
the
brow
,
denote
that
the
animal
heat
is
restored
.
<EOS>
A
third
draught
will
accomplish
the
cure
.
<EOS>
""I
can
already
feel
his
heart
palpitate
,
"
observed
Kelley
,
placing
his
hand
on
the
patient
's
breast
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Viviana
,
who
had
suspended
her
devotions
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"Hold
<EOS>
him
tightly
,
"
cried
Dee
to
his
assistant
,
"
while
I
administer
the
last
draught
.
<EOS>
He
may
injure
himself
by
his
struggles
.
<EOS>
"Kelley
<EOS>
obeyed
,
and
twined
his
arms
tightly
round
the
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
And
fortunate
it
was
that
the
precaution
was
taken
,
for
the
elixir
was
no
sooner
poured
down
his
throat
than
his
chest
began
to
labour
violently
,
his
eyes
opened
,
and
,
raising
himself
bolt
-
upright
,
he
struggled
violently
to
break
from
the
hold
imposed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
This
he
would
have
effected
,
if
Dee
had
not
likewise
lent
his
aid
to
prevent
him
.
<EOS>
"This
is
,
indeed
,
a
wonderful
sight
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
who
had
quitted
the
closet
,
and
now
gazed
on
,
in
awe
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
never
be
sufficiently
thankful
to
you
,
reverend
sir
.
<EOS>
""Give
<EOS>
thanks
to
Him
to
whom
alone
they
are
due
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
Summon
your
friends
.
<EOS>
They
may
now
resume
their
posts

<EOS>
My
task
is
accomplished

<EOS>
"Catesby
<EOS>
and
Garnet
being
called
into
the
room
,
could
scarcely
credit
their
senses
when
they
beheld
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
by
this
time
had
ceased
struggling
,
reclining
on
Kelley
's
shoulder
,
and
,
except
a
certain
wildness
in
the
eye

cadaverousness

looking

THE
COLLEGIATE
CHURCH
AT
MANCHESTERBidding
Kelley
remain
with
Guy
Fawkes
,
Doctor
Dee
signified
to
Viviana
that
he
had
a
few
words
to
say
to
her
in
private
before
his
departure
,
and
leading
the
way
to
an
adjoining
room
,
informed
her
that
he
was
aware
of
her
desire
to
have
her
father
's
remains
interred
in
the
Collegiate
Church
,
and
that
,
so
far
from
opposing
her
inclinations
,
he
would
willingly
accede
to
them
,
only
recommending
as
a
measure
of
prudence
that
the
ceremonial
should
be
performed
at
night
,
and
with
as
much
secrecy
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Viviana
thanked
him
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion
for
his
kindness
,
and
entirely
acquiesced
in
his
suggestion
of
caution
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
she
could
not
help
expressing
her
surprise
that
her
thoughts
should
be
known
to
him
.
"
<EOS>
Though
,
indeed
,
"
she
added
,
"
after
the
wonderful
exhibition
I
have
just
witnessed
of
your
power
,
I
can
scarcely
suppose
that
any
limits
are
to
be
placed
to
it
.
<EOS>
""Few
<EOS>
things
are
hidden
from
me
,
"
replied
Dee
,
with
a
gratified
smile
;
"
even
the
lighter
matters
of
the
heart
,
in
which
I
might
be
supposed
to
take
little
interest
,
do
not
altogether
elude
my
observation
.
<EOS>
In
reference
to
this
,
you
will
not
,
I
am
sure
be
offended
with
me
,
Viviana
,
if
I
tell
you
I
have
noticed
with
some
concern
the
attachment
that
has
arisen
between
you
and
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
and
a
deep
blush
suffused
her
pallid
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"I
am
assuming
the
privilege
of
an
old
man
with
you
,
Viviana
,
"
continued
Dee
,
in
a
graver
tone
,
"
and
I
may
add
,
of
an
old
friend,—for
<EOS>
your
lamented
mother
was
one
of
my
dearest
and
best
friends
,
as
you
perchance
called
to
mind
,
when
you
sent
me
to
-
day
,
by
Mr.
Catesby
,
the
token
I
gave
her
years
ago
.
<EOS>
You
have
done
unwisely
in
inviting
Humphrey
Chetham
to
come
hither
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
so
?
<EOS>
"
she
faltered
.
<EOS>
"Because
,
if
he
keeps
his
appointment
,
fatal
consequences
may
ensue
,
"
answered
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
message
has
reached
the
ears
of
one
from
whom,—most
of
all,—you
should
have
concealed
it
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
has
heard
of
it
,
I
know
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
do
not
apprehend
any
danger
from
him?""He
is
Chetham
's
mortal
foe
,
"
rejoined
Dee
,
"
and
will
slay
him
,
if
he
finds
an
opportunity
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
alarm
me
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
speak
to
Mr.
Catesby
on
the
subject
,
and
entreat
him
,
as
he
values
my
regard
,
to
offer
no
molestation
to
his
fancied
rival
.
<EOS>
""Fancied
rival
!
"
echoed
Dee
,
raising
his
brows
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
seek
to
persuade
me
that
you
do
not
love
Humphrey
<EOS>
Chetham?""Assuredly
not
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
freely
acknowledge
my
attachment
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
strong
as
my
aversion
to
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
But
the
latter
is
aware
that
the
suit
of
his
rival
is
as
hopeless
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
""Explain
<EOS>
yourself
,
I
pray
you
?
"
said
Dee
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
destiny
is
the
cloister,—and
this
he
well
knows
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
As
soon
as
my
worldly
affairs
can
be
arranged
,
I
shall
retire
to
the
English
nunnery
at
Brussels
,
where
I
shall
vow
myself
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""Such
is
your
present
intention
,
"
replied
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
never
quit
your
own
country
.
<EOS>
""What
shall
hinder
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Viviana
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Many
things
,
"
returned
Dee
.
"
<EOS>
Amongst
others
,
this
meeting
with
your
lover
.
<EOS>
""Call
him
not
by
that
name
<EOS>
,
I
beseech
you
,
reverend
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
will
never
be
other
to
me
than
a
friend
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
,
"
answered
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
But
your
destiny
is
not
the
cloister
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
what
am
I
reserved
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Viviana
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
I
dare
tell
you
,
"
he
returned
,
"
<EOS>
all
it
is
needful
for
you
to
know
,
is
,
that
your
future
career
is
mixed
up
with
that
of
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
concern
yourself
about
what
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
The
present
is
sufficient
to
claim
your
attention
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
and
my
first
object
shall
be
to
despatch
a
messenger
to
Humphrey
Chetham
to
prevent
him
from
coming
hither
.
<EOS>
""Trouble
<EOS>
yourself
no
further
on
that
score
,
"
returned
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
convey
the
message
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
regards
the
funeral
,
it
must
take
place
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
at
the
south
porch
of
the
church
with
the
keys
at
midnight
,
and
Robert
Burnell
,
the
sexton
,
and
another
assistant
on
whom
I
can
depend
,
shall
be
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
Though
it
is
contrary
to
my
religious
opinions
and
feelings
to
allow
a
Romish
priest
to
perform
the
service
,
I
will
not
interfere
with
Father
Garnet
.
<EOS>
I
owe
your
mother
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
,
and
will
pay
it
to
her
husband
and
her
child
.
<EOS>
""Thanks!—in
<EOS>
her
name
,
thanks
!
"
cried
Viviana
,
in
a
voice
suffocated
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
"
continued
Dee
,
"
I
would
ask
you
one
further
question
.
<EOS>
My
art
has
made
me
acquainted
that
a
plot
is
hatching
against
the
King
and
his
Government
by
certain
of
the
Catholic
party
.
<EOS>
Are
you
favourable
to
the
design?""I
<EOS>
am
not
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nor
can
you
regard
it
with
more
horror
than
myself
.
<EOS>
""I
was
sure
of
it
,
"
returned
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
am
glad
to
have
my
supposition
confirmed
from
your
own
mouth
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
moved
towards
the
door
,
but
Viviana
arrested
his
departure
.
<EOS>
"Stay
,
reverend
sir
,
"
she
cried
,
with
a
look
of
great
uneasiness
;
"
if
you
are
in
possession
of
this
dread
secret
,
the
lives
of
my
companions
are
in
your
power
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
betray
them
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
deem
it
your
duty
to
reveal
the
plot
to
those
endangered
by
it
,
you
will
give
its
contrivers
timely
warning
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
,
"
rejoined
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
,
were
I
so
disposed
,
interfere
with
the
fixed
purposes
of
fate
.
<EOS>
The
things
revealed
by
my
familiar
spirits
never
pass
my
lips
.
<EOS>
They
are
more
sacred
than
the
disclosures
made
to
a
priest
of
your
faith
at
the
confessional
.
<EOS>
The
bloody
enterprise
on
which
these
zealots
are
bent
will
fail
.
<EOS>
I
have
warned
Fawkes
;
but
my
warning
,
though
conveyed
by
the
lips
of
the
dead
,
and
by
other
means
equally
terrible
,
was
unavailing
.
<EOS>
I
would
warn
Catesby
and
Garnet
,
but
they
would
heed
me
not
.
<EOS>
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
"
he
continued
,
in
a
solemn
voice
,
"
you
questioned
me
just
now
about
the
future
.
<EOS>
Have
you
courage
to
make
the
same
demand
from
your
dead
father
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
I
will
compel
his
corpse
to
answer
you
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
no
—
no
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
horror
-
stricken
;
"
not
for
worlds
would
I
commit
so
impious
an
act
.
<EOS>
Gladly
as
I
would
know
what
fate
has
in
store
for
me
,
nothing
should
induce
me
to
purchase
the
knowledge
at
so
dreadful
a
price
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
At
midnight
,
at
the
south
porch
of
the
Collegiate
Church
,
I
shall
expect
you
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
took
his
departure
;
and
,
on
entering
the
gallery
,
he
perceived
Catesby
hastily
retreating
.
"Aha
!
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
had
a
listener
here
.
<EOS>
Well
,
no
matter
.
<EOS>
What
he
has
heard
may
prove
serviceable
to
him
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
returned
to
the
chamber
occupied
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
finding
he
had
dropped
into
a
deep
and
tranquil
sleep
,
motioned
Kelley
,
who
was
standing
by
the
bedside
watching
his
slumbers
with
folded
arms
,
to
follow
him
,
and
bowing
gravely
to
Garnet
quitted
the
hall
.
<EOS>
As
he
crossed
the
court
,
on
his
way
to
the
drawbridge
,
Catesby
suddenly
threw
himself
in
his
path
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
cried
in
a
menacing
voice,—"Doctor
Dee
,
<EOS>
neither
you
nor
your
companion
shall
quit
the
hall
till
you
have
solemnly
sworn
not
to
divulge
<EOS>
aught
pertaining
to
the
plot
,
of
which
you
have
so
mysteriously
obtained
information
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
<EOS>
my
recompence
for
rescuing
your
comrade
from
the
jaws
of
death
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Dee
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
necessity
of
the
case
must
plead
its
excuse
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
My
own
safety
,
and
the
safety
of
those
leagued
with
me
,
require
that
I
should
be
peremptory
in
my
demand
.
<EOS>
Did
I
not
owe
you
a
large
debt
of
gratitude
for
your
resuscitation
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
I
would
have
insured
your
secrecy
with
your
life
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
will
be
content
with
your
oath
.
<EOS>
""Fool
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Dee
,
"
stand
aside
,
or
I
will
compel
you
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Think
not
to
terrify
me
by
idle
threats
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
willingly
acknowledge
your
superior
skill,—as
,
indeed
,
I
have
good
reason
to
do,—in
the
science
of
medicine
;
but
I
have
no
faith
in
your
magical
tricks
.
<EOS>
A
little
reflection
has
shown
me
how
the
knowledge
I
at
first
thought
so
wonderful
was
acquired
.
<EOS>
You
obtained
it
by
means
of
Martin
Heydocke
,
who
,
mounted
on
a
swift
steed
,
reached
the
College
before
me
.
<EOS>
He
told
you
of
the
object
of
my
visit,—of
Viviana
's
wish
to
have
her
father
interred
in
the
Collegiate
Church,—of
her
message
to
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
You
were
,
therefore
,
fully
prepared
for
my
arrival
,
and
at
first
,
I
must
confess
,
completely
imposed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
had
I
not
overheard
your
conversation
just
now
with
Viviana
,
I
might
have
remained
your
dupe
still
.
<EOS>
But
your
allusion
to
Chetham
's
visit
awakened
my
suspicions
,
and
,
on
re
-
considering
the
matter
,
the
whole
trick
flashed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
""What
more
?
"
demanded
Dee
,
his
brow
lowering
,
and
his
eyes
sparkling
with
rage
.
<EOS>
"Thus
much
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
your
secret
,
and
you
have
mine
.
<EOS>
And
though
the
latter
is
the
more
important
,
inasmuch
as
several
lives
hang
upon
it
,
whereas
a
conjuror
's
worthless
reputation
is
alone
dependent
on
the
other
,
yet
both
must
be
kept
.
<EOS>
Swear
,
then
,
not
to
reveal
the
plot
,
and
in
my
turn
I
will
take
any
oath
you
choose
to
dictate
not
to
disclose
the
jugglery
I
have
detected
.
<EOS>
""I
will
make
no
terms
with
you
,
"
returned
Dee
;
"
and
if
I
do
not
reveal
your
damnable
plot
,
it
is
not
from
consideration
of
you
or
your
associates
,
but
because
the
hour
for
its
disclosure
is
not
yet
arrived
.
<EOS>
When
full
proof
of
your
guilt
can
be
obtained
,
then
rest
assured
it
will
be
made
known,—though
not
by
me
.
<EOS>
Not
one
of
your
number
shall
escape
—
not
one
.
"Catesby
<EOS>
again
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
seemed
from
his
looks
to
be
meditating
the
destruction
of
the
Doctor
and
his
assistant
.
<EOS>
But
they
appeared
wholly
unconcerned
at
his
glances
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
you
have
said
concerning
Martin
Heydocke
is
false
—
as
false
as
your
own
foul
and
bloody
scheme
,
"
pursued
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
neither
seen
,
nor
spoken
with
him
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
your
assistant
,
Edward
Kelley
,
has
,
"
retorted
Catesby
,
"
and
that
amounts
to
the
same
thing
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
the
third
and
last
time
I
command
you
to
stand
aside
,
"
cried
Dee
,
in
a
tone
of
concentrated
anger
.
<EOS>
Catesby
laughed
aloud
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
if
I
refuse
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
,
in
a
jeering
voice
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
made
no
answer
;
but
,
suddenly
drawing
a
small
phial
from
beneath
his
robe
,
cast
its
contents
in
his
opponent
's
face
.
<EOS>
Blinded
by
the
spirit
,
Catesby
raised
his
hand
to
his
eyes
,
and
while
in
this
condition
a
thick
cloth
was
thrown
over
his
head
from
behind
,
and
,
despite
his
resistance
,
he
was
borne
off
,
and
bound
with
a
strong
cord
to
an
adjoining
tree
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
elapsed
,
during
which
he
exhausted
his
fury
in
vain
outcries
for
assistance
,
and
execrations
and
menaces
against
Dee
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
hearing
steps
approaching
,
he
called
loudly
to
be
released
,
and
was
answered
by
the
voice
of
Martin
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
is
it
your
worship
I
behold
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Martin
,
in
a
tone
of
affected
commiseration
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mercy
on
us
!
<EOS>
what
has
happened
?
<EOS>
Have
the
rascally
searchers
been
here
again?""Hold
<EOS>
your
peace
,
knave
,
and
unbind
me
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
shrewdly
suspect
,
"
he
added
,
as
his
commands
were
obeyed
,
and
the
cord
twined
around
his
arms
unfastened
,
and
the
cloth
removed,—"I
shrewdly
suspect
,
"
he
said
,
fixing
a
stern
glance
upon
Martin
,
which
effectually
banished
the
smile
from
his
demure
countenance
,
"
that
you
have
had
some
share
in
this
business
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
I
,
your
worship
?
"
exclaimed
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
the
slightest
<EOS>
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
mere
chance
<EOS>
I
came
this
way
,
and
,
perceiving
some
one
tied
to
a
tree
,
was
about
to
take
to
my
heels
,
when
,
fancying
<EOS>
I
recognised
your
worship
's
well
-
formed
legs
,
I
ventured
forward
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
become
more
intimately
acquainted
with
my
worship
's
boots
,
rascal
,
if
I
find
my
suspicions
correct
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
the
effrontery
to
tell
me
you
have
never
seen
this
rope
and
this
cloth
before?""Certes
,
I
have
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
Martin
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
May
the
first
hang
me
,
and
the
last
serve
as
my
winding
-
sheet
,
if
I
speak
not
the
truth
!
<EOS>
Ah
,
now
I
look
again
,
"
he
added
,
pretending
to
examine
them
,
"
it
must
be
a
horse
-
cloth
and
halter
from
the
stable
.
<EOS>
Peradventure
,
I
have
seen
them
.
<EOS>
""That
I
will
be
sworn
you
have
,
and
used
them
too
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
half
inclined
to
tie
you
to
the
tree
in
my
place
.
<EOS>
But
where
is
your
employer?—where
is
Doctor
Dee?""Doctor
Dee
is
not
my
employer
,
"
answered
Martin
,
"
neither
do
I
serve
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Humphrey
Chetham
,
as
I
have
already
told
your
worship
,
is
my
master
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
Doctor
,
he
left
the
hall
some
time
since
.
<EOS>
Father
Garnet
thought
you
had
accompanied
him
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
Of
a
truth
I
have
not
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
reflected
a
moment
,
and
then
strode
towards
the
hall
,
while
Martin
,
with
a
secret
smile
,
picked
up
the
halter
and
cloth
,
and
withdrew
to
the
stable
.
<EOS>
Repairing
to
the
chamber
of
the
wounded
man
,
Catesby
found
Garnet
seated
by
his
couch
,
and
related
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
The
Jesuit
listened
with
profound
attention
to
the
recital
,
and
on
its
conclusion
observed,—"I
am
sorry
you
have
offended
Doctor
Dee
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
He
might
have
proved
a
good
friend
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
you
have
made
him
a
dangerous
enemy
.
<EOS>
""He
was
not
to
be
trusted
,
father
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
have
any
fears
of
him
,
or
Kelley
,
I
will
speedily
set
them
at
rest
.
<EOS>
""No
violence
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
only
increase
the
mischief
you
have
already
occasioned
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
Dee
will
betray
us
.
<EOS>
But
additional
circumspection
will
be
requisite
.
<EOS>
Tarry
here
while
I
confer
with
Viviana
on
this
subject
.
<EOS>
She
has
apparently
some
secret
influence
with
the
Doctor
,
and
may
be
prevailed
upon
to
exert
it
in
our
behalf
.
<EOS>
"It
was
long
before
Garnet
returned
.
<EOS>
When
he
reappeared
,
his
looks
convinced
Catesby
that
the
interview
had
not
proved
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
imprudence
has
placed
us
in
a
perilous
position
,
my
son
,
"
he
observed
.
<EOS>
"
Viviana
refuses
to
speak
to
Doctor
Dee
on
the
subject
,
and
strongly
reprobates
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
's
<EOS>
brow
lowered
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
but
one
course
to
pursue
,
"
he
muttered
,
rising
;
"
our
lives
or
his
must
be
sacrificed
.
<EOS>
I
will
act
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
authoritatively
.
"
<EOS>
Wait
till
to
-
morrow
and
,
if
aught
occurs
in
the
interim
to
confirm
your
suspicions
,
do
as
you
think
proper
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
oppose
you
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
forbear
so
long
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
"
it
will
not
be
safe
to
remain
here
.
<EOS>
""I
will
risk
it
,
"
said
Garnet
,
"
and
I
counsel
you
to
do
the
same
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
leave
Viviana
at
this
strait
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
such
thoughts
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
go
,
she
goes
too
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
will
be
in
vain
,
I
am
sure
,
to
endeavour
to
induce
her
to
accompany
you
till
her
father
is
interred
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"True
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
I
had
forgotten
that
.
<EOS>
We
shall
meet
the
hoary
juggler
at
the
church
,
and
an
opportunity
may
occur
for
executing
my
purpose
there
.
<EOS>
Unless
he
will
swear
at
the
altar
not
to
betray
us
,
he
shall
die
by
my
hand
.
<EOS>
""An
oath
in
such
a
case
would
be
no
security
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
;
"
and
his
slaughter
and
that
of
his
companion
would
be
equally
inefficacious
,
and
greatly
prejudicial
to
our
cause
.
<EOS>
If
he
means
to
betray
us
,
he
has
done
so
already
.
<EOS>
But
I
have
little
apprehension
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
him
well
affected
towards
the
government
,
and
I
can
not
but
think
,
if
you
had
not
thus
grossly
insulted
him
,
he
would
have
favoured
rather
than
opposed
our
design
.
<EOS>
If
he
was
aware
of
the
plot
,
and
adverse
to
it
,
what
need
was
there
to
exert
his
skill
in
behalf
of
our
dying
friend
,
<EOS>
who
,
but
for
him
,
would
have
been
,
ere
this
,
a
lump
of
lifeless
clay
?
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
You
are
far
too
hasty
in
your
judgment
.
<EOS>
Nor
am
I
less
surprised
at
your
injustice
.
<EOS>
Overlooking
the
great
benefit
conferred
upon
us
,
because
some
trifling
scheme
has
been
thwarted
,
you
would
requite
our
benefactor
by
cutting
his
throat
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
rebuke
is
just
,
father
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
acted
heedlessly
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
endeavour
to
repair
my
error
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
advisable
to
go
well
armed
to
the
church
to
-
night
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
I
shall
not
absent
myself
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
was
then
carried
on
,
on
other
topics
,
when
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Viviana
,
who
came
to
consult
them
about
the
funeral
.
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
—
since
better
could
not
be
found
—
that
the
vehicle
used
to
bring
thither
the
body
of
the
unfortunate
knight
should
transport
it
to
its
last
home
.
<EOS>
No
persuasions
of
Garnet
could
induce
Viviana
to
relinquish
the
idea
of
attending
the
ceremony
;
and
Catesby
,
though
he
affected
the
contrary
,
secretly
rejoiced
at
her
determination
.
<EOS>
Night
came
,
and
all
was
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Viviana
to
the
last
indulged
a
hope
that
Humphrey
Chetham
would
arrive
in
time
to
attend
the
funeral
with
her
;
but
,
as
he
did
not
appear
,
she
concluded
he
had
received
Doctor
Dee
's
warning
.
<EOS>
Martin
Heydocke
was
left
in
charge
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
still
continued
to
slumber
deeply
,
and
,
when
within
half
an
hour
of
the
appointed
time
,
the
train
set
out
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
well
mounted
,
and
proceeded
at
a
slow
pace
along
the
lane
skirting
the
west
bank
of
the
Irwell
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
profoundly
dark
;
and
,
as
it
was
not
deemed
prudent
to
carry
torches
,
some
care
was
requisite
to
keep
in
the
right
road
.
<EOS>
Catesby
rode
first
,
and
was
followed
by
Garnet
and
Viviana
,
after
whom
came
the
little
vehicle
containing
the
body
.
<EOS>
The
rear
was
brought
up
by
three
of
the
servants
sent
by
Sir
Everard
Digby
;
a
fourth
acting
as
driver
of
the
sorry
substitute
for
a
hearse
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
was
uttered
by
any
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
In
this
stealthy
manner
was
the
once
-
powerful
and
wealthy
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
the
owner
of
the
whole
district
through
which
they
were
passing
,
conveyed
to
the
burial
-
place
of
his
ancestors!In
shorter
time
than
they
had
allowed
themselves
for
the
journey
,
the
melancholy
cavalcade
reached
Salford
Bridge
,
and
crossing
it
at
a
quick
pace
,
as
had
been
previously
arranged
by
Catesby
,
arrived
without
molestation
or
notice
(
for
no
one
<EOS>
was
abroad
in
the
town
at
that
hour
)
at
the
southern
gate
of
the
Collegiate
Church
<EOS>
,
where
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
Guy
Fawkes
had
witnessed
the
execution
of
the
two
seminary
priests
,
and
on
the
spikes
of
which
their
heads
and
dismembered
bodies
were
now
fixed
.
<EOS>
An
old
man
here
presented
himself
,
and
,
unlocking
the
gate
,
informed
them
<EOS>
he
was
Robert
Burnell
,
the
sexton
.
<EOS>
The
shell
was
then
taken
out
,
and
borne
on
the
shoulders
of
the
servants
towards
the
church
,
Burnell
leading
the
way
.
<EOS>
Garnet
followed
;
and
as
soon
as
Catesby
had
committed
the
horses
to
the
care
of
the
driver
of
the
carriage
,
he
tendered
his
arm
to
Viviana
,
who
could
scarcely
have
reached
the
sacred
structure
unsupported
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
met
them
at
the
church
porch
,
as
he
had
appointed
,
and
,
as
soon
as
they
had
passed
through
it
,
the
door
was
locked
.
<EOS>
Addressing
a
few
words
in
an
under
tone
to
Viviana
,
but
not
deigning
to
notice
either
of
her
companions
,
Dee
directed
the
bearers
of
the
body
to
follow
him
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
choir
.
<EOS>
The
interior
of
the
reverend
and
beautiful
fane
was
buried
in
profound
gloom
,
and
the
feeble
light
diffused
by
the
sexton
's
lantern
only
made
the
darkness
more
palpable
.
<EOS>
On
entering
the
broad
and
noble
nave
nothing
could
be
seen
of
its
clustered
pillars
,
or
of
the
exquisite
pointed
arches
,
enriched
with
cinquefoil
and
quatrefoil
,
inclosing
blank
shields
,
which
they
supported
.
<EOS>
Neither
could
its
sculptured
cornice
;
its
clerestory
windows
;
its
upper
range
of
columns
,
supporting
demi
-
angels
playing
on
musical
instruments
;
its
moulded
roof
crossed
by
transverse
beams
,
enriched
in
the
interstices
with
sculptured
ornaments
,
be
distinguished
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
architectural
glories
were
invisible
;
but
the
very
gloom
in
which
they
were
shrouded
was
imposing
.
<EOS>
As
the
dim
light
fell
upon
pillar
after
pillar
as
they
passed
,
revealing
their
mouldings
,
piercing
a
few
feet
into
the
side
aisles
,
and
falling
upon
the
grotesque
heads
,
the
embattled
ornaments
and
grotesque
tracery
of
the
arches
,
the
effect
was
inexpressibly
striking
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
personages
inappropriate
to
the
sombre
scene
.
<EOS>
The
reverend
figure
of
Dee
,
with
his
loose
flowing
robe
and
long
white
beard
;
the
priestly
garb
and
grave
aspect
of
Garnet
;
the
soldier
-
like
bearing
of
Catesby
,
his
armed
heel
and
rapier
-
point
clanking
upon
the
pavement
;
the
drooping
figure
of
Viviana
,
whose
features
were
buried
in
her
kerchief
,
and
whose
sobs
were
distinctly
audible
;
the
strangely
-
fashioned
coffin
,
and
the
attendants
by
whom
it
was
borne;—all
constituted
a
singular
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
deeply
-
interesting
picture
.
<EOS>
Approaching
the
magnificent
screen
terminating
the
nave
,
they
passed
through
an
arched
gateway
within
it
,
and
entered
the
choir
.
<EOS>
The
west
-
end
of
this
part
of
the
church
was
assigned
as
the
burial
-
place
of
the
ancient
and
honourable
family
,
the
head
of
which
was
about
to
be
deposited
within
it
,
and
was
designated
from
the
circumstance
,
the
"
Radcliffe
chancel
.
<EOS>
"
A
long
slab
of
grey
marble
,
in
which
a
brass
plate
,
displaying
the
armorial
bearings
of
the
Radcliffes
,
was
inserted
,
had
been
removed
,
and
the
earth
thrown
out
of
the
cavity
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Kelley
,
who
had
assisted
in
making
the
excavation
,
was
standing
beside
it
,
leaning
on
a
spade
,
with
a
lantern
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
He
drew
aside
as
the
funeral
train
approached
,
and
the
shell
was
deposited
at
the
edge
of
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Picturesque
and
striking
as
was
the
scene
in
the

now
exhibited
.
<EOS>
The

of
the
Collegiate
Church
at
Manchester
may
challenge
comparison
with
any
similar
structure
.
<EOS>
Its
thirty
elaborately
-
carved
stalls
,
covered
with
canopies
of
the
richest
tabernacle
work
,
surmounted
by
niches
,
mouldings
,
pinnacles
,
and
perforated
tracery
,
and
crowned
with
a
richly
-
sculptured
cornice
;
its
side

with
their
pillars
and

;
its
moulded
ceiling
rich
in
the
most
delicate
and
fairy

its
gorgeous
altar

and
its
magnificent
eastern
window
,
then
filled
with
stained
glass
,
form
a
coup
-
d'oeil
of
almost
unequalled
splendour
and
beauty
.
<EOS>
Few
of
these
marvels
could
now
be
seen
.
<EOS>
But
such
points
of
the
pinnacles
and
hanging
canopies
of
the
stalls
,
of
the
façades
of
the
side
-
aisles
,
and
of
the
fretted
roof
,
as
received
any
portion
of
the

,
came
in
with
admirable
effect
.
<EOS>
"All
is
prepared
,
you
perceive
,
"
observed
Dee
to
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
retire
while
the
ceremony
is
performed
.
"
<EOS>
And
gravely
inclining
his
head
,
he
passed
through
an
arched
door
in
the
south
aisle
,
and
entered
the
chapter
-
house
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
about
to
proceed
with
the
service
appointed
by
the
Romish
Church
for
the
burial
of
the
dead
,
when
Viviana
,
uttering
a
loud
cry
,
would
have
fallen
,
if
Catesby
had
not
flown
to
her
assistance
,
and
borne
her
to
one
of
the
stalls
.
<EOS>
Recovering
her
self
-
possession
the
next
moment
,
she
entreated
him
to
leave
her
;
and
while
the
service
proceeded
,
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
fervently
for
the
soul
of
the
departed
.
<EOS>
Placing
himself
at
the
foot
of
the
body
,
Garnet
sprinkled
it
with
holy
water
,
which
he
had
brought
with
him
in
a
small
silver
consecrated
vessel
.
<EOS>
He
then
recited
the
De
Profundis
,
the
Miserere
,
and
other
antiphons
and
prayers
;
placed
incense
in
a
burner
,
which
he
had
likewise
brought
with
him
,
and
having
lighted
it
,
bowed
reverently
towards
the
altar
,
sprinkled
the
body
thrice
with
holy
water
,
at
the
sides
,
at
the
head
,
and
the
feet
;
and
then
walking
round
it
with
the
incense
-
burner
,
dispersed
its
fragrant
odour
over
it
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
recited
another
prayer
,
pronounced
a
solemn
benediction
over
the
place
of
sepulture
,
and
the
body
was
lowered
into
it
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
earth
falling
upon
the
shell
aroused
Viviana
from
her
devotions
.
<EOS>
She
looked
towards
the
grave
,
but
could
see
nothing
but
the
gloomy
group
around
it
,
<EOS>
prominent
among
which
appeared
the
tall
figure
of
Catesby
.
<EOS>
The
sight
was
too
much
for
her
,
and
,
unable
to
control
her
grief
,
she
fainted
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
grave
was
rapidly
filled
,
all
lending
their
aid
to
the
task
;
and
nothing
was
wanting
but
to
restore
the
slab
to
its
original
position
.
<EOS>
By
the
united
efforts
of
Catesby
,
Kelley
,
and
the
sexton
,
this
was
soon
accomplished
,
and
the
former
,
unaware
of
what
had
happened
,
was
about
to
proceed
to
Viviana
,
to
tell
her
all
was
over
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
church
door
,
accompanied
by
a
clamorous
demand
for
admittance
.
<EOS>
"We
are
betrayed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
as
I
suspected
.
<EOS>
Take
care
of
Viviana
,
father
.
<EOS>
I
will
after
the
hoary
impostor
,
and
cleave
his
skull
!
<EOS>
Extinguish
the
lights
—
quick
!
<EOS>
quick!"Garnet
hastily
complied
with
these
injunctions
,
and
the
choir
was
plunged
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
He
then
rushed
to
the
stalls
,
but
could
nowhere
find
Viviana
.
<EOS>
He
called
her
by
name
,
but
received
no
answer
,
and
was
continuing
his
fruitless
search
,
when
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
,
and
the
voice
of
Catesby
exclaimed,"Follow
me
with
your
charge
,
father
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
my
son
,
she
is
not
here
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
searched
each
stall
as
carefully
as
I
could
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
I
fear
she
has
been
spirited
away
.
""Impossible
!
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
And
he
ran
his
hand
along
the
row
of
sculptured
seats
,
but
without
success
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
indeed
gone
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
here
I
left
her
—
<EOS>
nay
,
here
I
beheld
her
at
the
very
moment
the
lights
were
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Viviana!—Viviana!"But
all
was
silent
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
is
that
cursed
magician
's
handiwork
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
striking
his
forehead
in
despair
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
you
find
him
?
"
demanded
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
The
door
of
the
chapter
-
house
was
locked
inside
.
<EOS>
The
treacherous
villain
did
well
to
guard
against
my
fury
.
<EOS>
""You
provoked
his
resentment
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
a
season
for
reproaches
.
<EOS>
Something
must
be
done
.
<EOS>
Where
is
Kelley?"At
<EOS>
the
suggestion
,
Catesby
instantly
darted
to
the
spot
where
the
seer
had
stood
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
there
.
<EOS>
He
then
questioned
the
servants
,
whose
teeth
were
chattering
with
fright
,
but
they
had
neither
heard
him
depart
,
nor
could
tell
anything
about
him
;
and
perceiving
plainly
from
their
trepidation
that
these
men
would
lend
no
aid
,
even
if
they
did
not
join
the
assailants
,
he
returned
to
communicate
his
apprehensions
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
During
all
this
time
the
knocking
and
vociferations
at
the
door
had
continued
with
increased
violence
,
and
reverberated
in
hollow
peals
along
the
roof
and
aisles
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
The
emergency
was
a
fearful
one
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
however
,
had
been
too
often
placed
in
situations
of
peril
,
and
was
too
constitutionally
brave
,
to
experience
much
uneasiness
for
himself
;
but
his
apprehensions
lest
Garnet
should
be
captured
,
and
the
sudden
and
mysterious
disappearance
of
Viviana
almost
distracted
him
.
<EOS>
Persuading
himself
she
might
have
fallen
to
the
ground
,
or
that
he
had
overlooked
the
precise
spot
where
he
had
left
her
,
he
renewed
his
search
,
but
with
no
better
success
than
before
;
and
he
was
almost
beginning
to
believe
that
some
magic
might
have
been
practised
to
cause
her
disappearance
,
when
it
occurred
to
him
that
she
had
been
carried
off
by
Kelley
.
<EOS>
"Fool
<EOS>
that
I
was
,
not
to
think
of
that
before
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
unintentionally
aided
their
project
by
extinguishing
the
lights
.
<EOS>
But
now
that
I
am
satisfied
she
is
gone
,
I
can
devote
my
whole
energies
to
the
preservation
of
Garnet
.
<EOS>
They
shall
not
capture
us
so
easily
as
they
anticipate
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
approached
the
priest
,
and
grasping
his
hand
drew
him
noislessly
along
.
<EOS>
They
had
scarcely
passed
through
the
arched
doorway
in
the
screen
,
and
set
foot
within
the
nave
,
when
the
clamour
without
ceased
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
a
thundering
crash
was
heard
;
the
door
burst
open
,
and
a
number
of
armed
figures
bearing
torches
,
with
drawn
swords
in
their
hands
,
rushed
with
loud
vociferations
into
the
church
.
<EOS>
"We
must
surrender
,
my
son
,
"
cried
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
useless
to
contend
against
that
force
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
we
may
yet
escape
them
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
And
glancing
hastily
round
he
perceived
a
small
open
door
in
the
wall
at
the
right
,
and
pointing
it
out
to
the
priest
,
hurried
towards
it
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
it
,
they
found
it
communicated
with
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
evidently
leading
to
the
roof
.
"Saved
!
<EOS>
saved
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
triumphantly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mount
first
,
father
.
<EOS>
I
will
defend
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"The
pursuers
,
who
saw
the
course
taken
by
the
fugitives
,
set
up
a
loud
shout
,
and
ran
as
swiftly
as
they
could
in
the
same
direction
,
and
by
the
time
the
latter
had
gained
the
door
they
were
within
a
few
yards
of
it
.
<EOS>
Garnet
darted
up
the
steps
;
but
Catesby
lingered
to
make
fast
the
door
,
and
thus
oppose
some
obstacle
to
the
hostile
party
.
<EOS>
His
efforts
,
however
,
were
unexpectedly
checked
,
and
,
on
examination
,
he
found
it
was
hooked
to
the
wall
at
the
back
.
<EOS>
Undoing
the
fastening
,
the
door
swung
to
,
and
he
instantly
bolted
it
.
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
his
success
,
and
leaving
his
pursuers
,
who
at
this
moment
arrived
,
to
vent
their
disappointment
in
loud
menaces
,
he
hastened
after
Garnet
.
<EOS>
Calling
loudly
to
him
,
he
was
answered
from
a
small
dark
chamber
on
the
right
,
into
which
the
priest
had
retreated
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
but
prolonged
our
torture
,
"
groaned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
find
no
outlet
.
<EOS>
Our
foes
will
speedily
force
an
entrance
,
and
we
must
then
fall
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
""There
must
be
some
door
opening
upon
the
roof
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Mount
as
high
as
you
can
,
and
search
carefully
.
<EOS>
I
will
defend
the
stairs
,
and
will
undertake
to
maintain
my
post
against
the
whole
rout
.
<EOS>
"Thus
urged
,
Garnet
ascended
the
steps
.
<EOS>
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
during
which
the
thundering
at
the
door
below
increased
,
and
the
heavy
blows
of
some
weighty
implement
directed
against
it
,
were
distinctly
heard
,
he
cried,"I
have
found
a
door
,
but
the
bolts
are
rusty
—
I
can
not
move
them
.
<EOS>
""Use
<EOS>
all
your
strength
,
father
,
"
shouted
Catesby
,
who
having
planted
himself
with
his
drawn
sword
at
an
advantageous
point
,
was
listening
with
intense
anxiety
to
the
exertions
of
the
assailing
party
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
relax
your
efforts
for
a
moment
.
<EOS>
""It
is
in
vain
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
in
accents
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
My
hands
are
bruised
and
bleeding
,
but
the
bolts
stir
not
.
<EOS>
""Distraction
!
"
cried
Catesby
,
gnashing
his
teeth
with
rage
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
try
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
hasten
to
the
priest
's
assistance
,
when
the
door
below
was
burst
open
with
a
loud
crash
,
and
the
assailants
rushed
up
the
steps
.
<EOS>
The
passage
was
so
narrow
that
they
were
compelled
to
mount
singly
,
and
Catesby
's
was
scarcely
a
vain
boast
when
he
said
he
could
maintain
his
ground
against
the
whole
host
.
<EOS>
Shouting
to
Garnet
to
renew
his
efforts
,
he
prepared
for
the
assault
.
<EOS>
Reserving
his
petronels
to
the
last
,
he
trusted
solely
to
his
rapier
,
and
leaning
against
the
newel
,
or
circular
column
round
which
the
stairs
twined
,
he
was
in
a
great
measure
defended
from
the
weapons
of
his
adversaries
,
while
they
were
completely
exposed
to
his
attack
.
<EOS>
The
darkness
,
moreover
,
in
which
he
was
enveloped
offered
an
additional
protection
,
whereas
the
torches
they
carried
made
his
mark
certain
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
foremost
of
the
band
came
within
reach
,
Catesby
plunged
his
sword
into
his
breast
,
and
pushed
him
back
with
all
his
force
upon
his
comrades
.
<EOS>
The
man
fell
heavily
backwards
,
dislodging
the
next
in
advance
,
who
in
his
turn
upset
his
successor
,
and
so
on
,
till
the
whole
band
was
thrown
into
confusion
.
<EOS>
A
discharge
of
fire
-
arms
followed
;
but
,
sheltered
by
the
newel
,
Catesby
sustained
no
injury
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
he
was
cheered
by
a
cry
from
Garnet
that
he
had
succeeded
in
forcing
back
the
bolts
,
terror
having
supplied
him
with
a
strength
not
his
own
;
and
,
making
another
sally
upon
his
assailants
,
amid
the
disorder
that
ensued
,
Catesby
retreated
,
and
rapidly
tracking
the
steps
,
reached
the
door
,
through
which
the
priest
had
already
passed
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
short
distance
of
the
outlet
,
Catesby
felt
,
from
the
current
of
fresh
air
that
saluted
him
,
that
it
opened
upon
the
roof
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
deceived
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
placed
him
upon
the
leads
,
where
he
found
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"It
is
you
,
my
son
,
"
cried
the
latter
,
on
beholding
him
;
"
I
thought
from
the
shouts
you
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
""No
,
Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
I
am
as
yet
safe
,
and
trust
to
deliver
you
out
of
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
to
the
battlements
.
<EOS>
""The
battlements
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
A
leap
from
such
a
height
as
that
were
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
""It
were
so
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
dragging
him
along
.
"
<EOS>
But
trust
to
me
,
and
you
shall
yet
reach
the
ground
uninjured
.
<EOS>
"Arrived
<EOS>
at
the
battlements
,
Catesby
leaned
over
them
,
and
endeavoured
to
ascertain
what
was
beneath
.
<EOS>
It
was
still
so
dark
that
he
could
scarcely
discern
any
objects
but
those
close
to
him
,
but
as
far
as
he
could
trust
his
vision
,
he
thought
he
perceived
a
projecting
building
some
twelve
or
fourteen
feet
below
;
and
calling
to
mind
the
form
of
the
church
,
which
he
had
frequently
seen
and
admired
,
he
remembered
its
chantries
,
and
had
no
doubt
<EOS>
but
it
was
the
roof
of
one
of
them
that
he
beheld
.
<EOS>
If
he
could
reach
it
,
the
descent
from
thence
would
be
easy
,
and
he
immediately
communicated
the
idea
to
Garnet
,
who
shrank
aghast
from
it
.
<EOS>
Little
time
,
however
,
was
allowed
for
consideration
.
<EOS>
Their
pursuers
had
already
scaled
the
stairs
,
and
were
springing
one
after
another
upon
the
leads
,
uttering
the
most
terrible
threats
against
the
destroyer
of
their
comrade
.
<EOS>
Hastily
divesting
himself
of
his
cloak
,
Catesby
clambered
over
the
battlements
,
and
,
impelled
by
fear
,
Garnet
threw
off
his
robe
,
and
followed
his
example
.
<EOS>
Clinging
to
the
grotesque
stone
waterspouts
which
projected
below
the
battlements
,
and
placing
the
points
of
his
feet
upon
the
arches
of
the
clerestory
windows
,
and
thence
upon
the
mullions
and
transom
bars
,
Catesby
descended
in
safety
,
and
then
turned
to
assist
his
companion
,
who
was
quickly
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
The
most
difficult
and
dangerous
part
of
the
descent
had
yet
to
be
accomplished
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
nearly
thirty
feet
from
the
ground
,
and
the
same
irregularities
in
the
walls
which
had
favoured
them
in
the
upper
structure
did
not
exist
in
the
lower
.
<EOS>
But
their
present
position
,
exposed
as
it
was
to
their
pursuers
,
who
,
having
reached
the
point
immediately
overhead
,
were
preparing
to
fire
upon
them
,
was
too
dangerous
to
allow
of
its
occupation
for
a
moment
,
and
Garnet
required
no
urging
to
make
him
clamber
over
the
low
embattled
parapet
.
<EOS>
Descending
a
flying
buttress
that
defended
an
angle
of
the
building
,
Catesby
,
who
was
possessed
of
great
strength
and
activity
,
was
almost
instantly
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
not
so
fortunate
.
<EOS>
Missing
his
footing
,
he
fell
from
a
considerable
height
,
and
his
groans
proclaimed
that
he
had
received
some
serious
injury
.
<EOS>
Catesby
instantly
flew
to
him
,
and
demanded
,
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
anxiety
,
whether
he
was
much
hurt
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
right
arm
is
broken
,
"
gasped
the
sufferer
,
raising
himself
with
difficulty
.
<EOS>
"
What
other
injuries
I
have
sustained
I
know
not
;
but
every
joint
seems
dislocated
,
and
my
face
is
covered
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Heaven
have
pity
on
me!"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
a
shout
of
exultation
arose
from
the
hostile
party
,
who
,
having
heard
Garnet
's
fall
,
and
the
groans
that
succeeded
it
,
at
once
divined
the
cause
,
and
made
sure
of
a
capture
.
<EOS>
A
deep
silence
followed
,
proving
that
they
had
quitted
the
roof
,
and
were
hastening
to
secure
their
prey
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
it
would
take
them
some
little
time
to
descend
the
winding
staircase
,
and
traverse
the
long
aisle
of
the
church
,
Catesby
felt
certain
of
distancing
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
not
abandon
Garnet
,
who
had
become
insensible
from
the
agony
of
his
fractured
limb
,
and
,
lifting
him
carefully
in
his
arms
,
he
placed
him
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
started
at
a
swift
pace
towards
the
further
extremity
of
the
churchyard
.
<EOS>
At
the
period
of
this
history
,
the
western
boundary
of
the
Collegiate
Church
was
formed
by
a
precipitous
sandstone
rock
of
great
height
,
the
base
of
which
was
washed
by
the
waters
of
the
Irwell
,
while
its
summit
was
guarded
by
a
low
stone
wall
.
<EOS>
In
after
years
,
a
range
of
small
habitations
was
built
upon
this
spot
,
but
they
have
been
recently
removed
,
and
the
rock
having
been
lowered
,
a
road
now
occupies
their
site
.
<EOS>
Nerved
by
desperation
,
Catesby
,
who
was
sufficiently
well
acquainted
with
the
locality
to
know
whither
he
was
shaping
his
course
,
determined
to
hazard
a
descent
,
which
,
under
calmer
circumstances
,
he
would
have
deemed
wholly
impracticable
.
<EOS>
His
pursuers
,
who
issued
from
the
church
porch
a
few
seconds
after
he
had
passed
it
,
saw
him
hurry
towards
the
low
wall
edging
the
precipice
,
and
,
encumbered
as
he
was
with
the
priest
,
vault
over
it
.
<EOS>
Not
deeming
it
possible
he
would
dare
to
spring
from
such
a
height
,
they
darted
after
him
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
deceived
,
and
could
scarcely
credit
their
senses
when
they
found
him
gone
.
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
their
torches
they
perceived
him
shooting
down
the
almost
perpendicular
side
of
the
rock
,
and
the
next
moment
a
hollow
plunge
told
that
he
had
reached
the
water
.
<EOS>
They
stared
at
each
other
in
mute
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
follow
him
,
Dick
Haughton
?
<EOS>
"
observed
one
,
as
soon
as
he
had
recovered
his
speech
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
I
,
"
replied
the
fellow
addressed
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
fancy
for
a
broken
neck
.
<EOS>
Follow
him
thyself
if
thou
hast
a
mind
to
try
the
soundness
of
thy
pate
.
<EOS>
I
warrant
that
rock
will
put
it
to
the
proof
.
<EOS>
""Yet
<EOS>
the
feat
has
just
been
done
,
and
by
one
burthened
with
a
wounded
comrade
into
the
bargain
,
"
remarked
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"He
must
be
the
devil
<EOS>
,
that
's
certain
,
"
rejoined
Haughton
;
"
and
Doctor
Dee
himself
is
no
match
for
him
.
<EOS>
""He
has
the
Devil
's
luck
,
that
's
certain
,
"
cried
a
third
soldier
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
hark
!
<EOS>
he
is
swimming
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
We
may
yet
catch
him
on
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
comrades
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
they
rushed
out
of
the
churchyard
;
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
the
bridge
;
and
crossing
it
,
flew
to
the
bank
of
the
river
,
where
they
dispersed
in
every
direction
,
in
search
for
the
fugitive
.
<EOS>
But
they
could
not
discover
a
trace
of
him
or
his
wounded
companion
.
<EOS>
XVII

<EOS>
—
THE
RENCOUNTERCatesby
himself
could
scarcely
tell
how
he
accomplished
his
hair
-
breadth
escape
.
<EOS>
Reckless
almost
of
the
result
,
he
slided
down
the
rock
,
catching
at
occasional
irregularities
as
he
descended
.
<EOS>
The
river
was
of
great
depth
at
this
point
,
and
broke
the
force
of
his
fall
.
<EOS>
On
rising
,
he
struck
out
a
few
yards
,
and
suffered
himself
to
be
carried
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
for
one
moment
relinquished
his
hold
of
Garnet
,
and
being
an
admirable
swimmer
,
found
little
difficulty
in
sustaining
him
with
one
arm
,
while
with
the
other
he
guided
his
course
in
the
water
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
he
reached
the
shore
in
safety
,
about
a
hundred
yards
below
the
bridge
,
by
which
means
he
avoided
his
pursuers
,
who
,
as
has
just
been
stated
,
searched
for
him
above
it
.
<EOS>
After
debating
with
himself
for
a
short
time
as
to
what
course
he
should
pursue
,
he
decided
upon
conveying
Garnet
to
the
Hall
,
where
he
could
procure
restoratives
and
assistance
;
and
though
he
was
fully
sensible
of
the
danger
of
this
plan
,
not
doubting
the
mansion
would
be
visited
and
searched
by
his
pursuers
before
morning
,
yet
the
necessity
of
warning
Guy
Fawkes
outweighed
every
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
again
shouldering
the
priest
,
who
,
though
he
had
regained
his
sensibility
,
was
utterly
unable
to
move
,
he
commenced
his
toilsome
march
;
and
being
frequently
obliged
to
pause
and
rest
himself
,
more
than
an
hour
elapsed
before
he
reached
his
destination
.
<EOS>
It
was
just
growing
light
as
he
crossed
the
drawbridge
,
and
seeing
a
horse
tied
to
a
tree
,
and
the
gate
open
,
he
began
to
fear
the
enemy
had
preceded
him
.
<EOS>
Full
of
misgiving
,
he
laid
Garnet
upon
a
heap
of
straw
in
an
outbuilding
,
and
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
found
no
one
below
,
though
he
glanced
into
each
room
.
<EOS>
He
then
noiselessly
ascended
the
stairs
,
with
the
intention
of
proceeding
to
Guy
Fawkes
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
As
he
traversed
the
gallery
,
he
heard
voices
in
one
of
the
chambers
,
the
door
of
which
was
ajar
,
and
pausing
to
listen
,
distinguished
the
tones
of
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
astonishment
,
he
was
about
to
enter
the
room
to
inquire
by
what
means
she
had
reached
the
Hall
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
voice
of
her
companion
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
Maddened
by
jealousy
,
Catesby
's
first
impulse
was
to
rush
into
the
room
,
and
stab
his
rival
in
the
presence
of
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
But
he
restrained
his
passion
by
a
powerful
effort
.
<EOS>
After
listening
for
a
few
minutes
intently
to
their
conversation
,
he
found
that
Chetham
was
taking
leave
,
and
creeping
softly
down
-
stairs
,
stationed
himself
in
the
hall
,
through
which
he
knew
his
rival
must
necessarily
pass
.
<EOS>
Chetham
presently
appeared
.
<EOS>
His
manner
was
dejected
;
his
looks
downcast
;
and
he
would
have
passed
Catesby
without
observing
him
,
if
the
latter
had
not
laid
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
young
merchant
,
starting
as
he
beheld
the
stern
glance
fixed
upon
him
<EOS>
"
I
thought——""You
thought
I
was
a
prisoner
,
no
doubt
,
"
interrupted
Catesby
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
am
here
to
confound
you
and
your
juggling
and
treacherous
associate
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
understand
you
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"I
will
soon
make
myself
intelligible
,
"
retorted
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Follow
me
to
the
garden
.
<EOS>
""I
perceive
your
purpose
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
calmly
;
"
but
it
is
no
part
of
my
principles
to
expose
my
life
to
ruffianly
violence
.
<EOS>
If
you
choose
to
lay
aside
this
insolent
demeanour
,
which
is
more
befitting
an
Alsatian
bully
than
a
gentleman
,
I
will
readily
give
you
such
explanation
of
my
conduct
as
will
fully
content
you
,
and
satisfy
you
that
any
suspicions
you
may
entertain
of
me
are
unfounded
.
<EOS>
""Coward
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
striking
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
no
explanation
.
<EOS>
Defend
yourself
,
or
I
will
treat
you
with
still
greater
indignity
.
<EOS>
""Lead
<EOS>
on
,
then
,
"
cried
Chetham
:
"
<EOS>
I
would
have
avoided
the
quarrel
if
I
could
.
<EOS>
But
this
outrage
shall
not
pass
unpunished
.
<EOS>
"As
they
quitted
the
hall
,
Viviana
entered
it
;
and
,
though
she
was
greatly
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
Catesby
,
his
furious
gestures
left
her
in
no
doubt
as
to
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
She
called
to
him
to
stop
.
<EOS>
But
no
attention
was
paid
by
either
party
to
her
cries
.
<EOS>
IllustrationOn
gaining
a
retired
spot
beneath
the
trees
,
Catesby
,
without
giving
his
antagonist
time
to
divest
himself
of
the
heavy
horseman
's
cloak
with
which
he
was
encumbered
,
and
scarcely
to
draw
his
sword
,
assaulted
him
.
<EOS>
The
combat
was
furious
on
both
sides
,
but
it
was
evident
that
the
young
merchant
was
no
match
for
his
adversary
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
his
ground
,
however
,
for
some
time
with
great
resolution
;
but
,
being
hotly
pressed
,
in
retreating
to
avoid
a
thrust
,
his
foot
caught
in
the
long
grass
,
and
he
fell
.
<EOS>
Catesby
would
have
passed
his
sword
through
his
body
,
if
it
had
not
been
turned
aside
by
another
weapon
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
,
followed
by
Martin
Heydocke
,
had
staggered
towards
the
scene
of
strife
,
reaching
it
just
in
time
to
save
the
life
of
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
too
late
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Put
up
your
blade
,
Catesby
;
or
,
turn
it
against
me
.
"XVIII

<EOS>
—
THE
EXPLANATIONUttering
an
exclamation
of
rage
<EOS>
,
Catesby
turned
fiercely
upon
Fawkes
,
and
for
a
moment
appeared
disposed
to
accept
his
invitation
to
continue
the
combat
with
him
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
regarded
the
other
's
haggard
features
,
and
perceived
in
them
the
traces
of
his
recent
struggle
with
death
—
as
he
saw
he
was
scarcely
able
to
wield
the
blade
he
opposed
against
him
—
his
wrath
changed
to
compassion
,
and
he
sheathed
his
sword
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Humphrey
Chetham
had
sprung
to
his
feet
,
and
picking
up
his
fallen
weapon
,
stood
on
his
defence
.
<EOS>
But
finding
that
Catesby
meditated
no
further
hostilities
,
he
returned
it
to
the
scabbard
.
<EOS>
"I
owe
my
life
to
you
,
"
he
said
to
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
a
tone
of
deep
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
owe
it
to
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
not
to
me
,
"
returned
Fawkes
feebly
,
and
leaning
upon
his
sword
for
support
.
"
<EOS>
Had
it
not
been
for
her
cries
,
I
should
have
known
nothing
of
this
quarrel
.
<EOS>
And
I
would
now
gladly
learn
what
has
occasioned
it
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
would
I
,
"
added
Chetham
;
"
for
I
am
as
ignorant
as
yourself
<EOS>
how
I
have
offended
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
""I
will
tell
you
,
then
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
were
a
party
to
the
snare
set
for
us
by
Dr.
Dee
,
from
which
I
narrowly
escaped
with
life
,
and
Father
Garnet
at
the
expense
of
a
broken
limb
.
<EOS>
""Is
Garnet
hurt
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Fawkes
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"Grievously
,
"
replied
Catesby
<EOS>
;
"
but
he
is
out
of
the
reach
of
his
enemies
,
of
whom
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
Chetham
,
"
one
of
the
most
malignant
and
treacherous
now
stands
before
you
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
in
the
dark
as
to
what
has
happened
,
"
observed
Fawkes
,
"
having
only
a
few
minutes
ago
been
roused
from
my
slumbers
by
the
shrieks
of
Viviana
,
who
entreated
me
to
come
and
separate
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
believe
Humphrey
Chetham
so
treacherous
as
you
represent
him
.
<EOS>
""So
far
from
having
any
enmity
towards
Father
Garnet
,
"
observed
Chetham
,
"
<EOS>
my
anxious
desire
was
to
preserve
him
;
and
with
that
view
,
I
was
repairing
to
Dr.
Dee
,
when
I
encountered
Mr.
Catesby
in
the
hall
,
and
before
I
could
offer
any
explanation
,
I
was
forced
by
his
violence
and
insults
into
this
combat
.
<EOS>
""Is
this
<EOS>
the
truth
,
Catesby
?
"
asked
Fawkes,"Something
near
it
,
"
rejoined
the
latter
;
"
but
perhaps
Mr.
Chetham
will
likewise
inform
you
by
whose
agency
<EOS>
Viviana
was
transported
hither
from
the
Collegiate
Church?""That
inquiry
<EOS>
ought
rather
to
be
made
of
the
lady
herself
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
coldly
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
am
assured
she
would
have
no
objection
to
my
answering
it
,
I
shall
not
hesitate
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
She
was
conveyed
hither
by
Kelley
and
an
assistant
,
who
departed
as
soon
as
their
task
was
completed
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
between
his
ground
teeth
.
"
<EOS>
But
how
chanced
it
,
sir
,
that
you
arrived
here
<EOS>
so
opportunely?""I
might
well
refuse
to
answer
a
question
thus
insolently
put
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
.
"
<EOS>
But
to
prevent
further
misunderstanding
,
I
will
tell
you
,
that
I
came
by
Viviana
's
invitation
at
midnight
;
and
,
ascertaining
from
my
servant
,
Martin
Heydocke
,
whom
I
found
watching
by
the
couch
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
the
melancholy
business
on
which
she
was
engaged
<EOS>
,
I
determined
to
await
her
return
,
which
occurred
about
an
hour
afterwards
,
in
the
manner
I
have
just
related
.
<EOS>
""I
was
in
the
court
-
yard
when
Mistress
Viviana
was
brought
back
,
"
interposed
Martin
Heydocke
,
who
was
standing
at
a
respectful
distance
from
the
group
;
"
and
,
<EOS>
after
Kelley
had
delivered
her
to
my
charge
,
I
heard
him
observe
in
an
under
tone
to
his
companion
,
'
Let
us
ride
back
as
fast
as
we
can
,
and
see
what
they
have
done
with
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
'""They
made
sure
of
their
prey
before
it
was
captured
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
bitterly
.
"
<EOS>
But
we
have
disappointed
them
.
<EOS>
Dee
and
his
associate
may
yet
have
reason
to
repent
their
perfidy
.
<EOS>
""You
will
do
well
not
to
put
yourself
again
in
their
power
,
"
observed
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
be
counselled
by
me
,
you
and
Guy
Fawkes
will
seek
safety
in
instant
flight
.
<EOS>
""And
leave
you
with
Viviana
?
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"She
is
in
no
present
danger
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
it
is
thought
fitting
or
desirable
,
I
will
remain
with
her
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
doubt
it
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
with
a
sneer
;
"
but
it
is
neither
fitting
nor
desirable
.
<EOS>
And
,
hark
ye
,
young
sir
,
if
you
have
indulged
any
expectations
with
regard
to
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
it
is
time
you
were
undeceived
.
<EOS>
She
will
never
we
d
one
of
your
degree
,
nor
of
your
faith
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
her
own
assurance
<EOS>
she
will
never
we
d
at
all
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
in
an
offended
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
had
she
not
crushed
my
hopes
by
declaring
she
was
vowed
to
a
convent
,
no
menaces
of
yours
,
who
have
neither
right
nor
title
thus
to
interfere
,
should
induce
me
to
desist
from
my
suit
.
<EOS>
""Either
resign
all
pretensions
to
her
hand
,
or
prepare
to
renew
the
combat
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
more
of
this
,
"
interposed
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
return
to
the
house
,
and
adjust
our
differences
there
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
further
business
here
,
"
observed
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
Having
taken
leave
of
Viviana
,
"
he
added
,
with
much
emotion
,
"
I
do
not
desire
to
meet
her
again
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
:
"
<EOS>
yet
,
stay!—you
mean
us
<EOS>
no
treachery?""If
<EOS>
you
suspect
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
remain
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
no
account
,
"
interposed
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
him
with
my
life
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
,
when
I
tell
you
I
have
procured
the
liberation
of
Father
Oldcorne
,
"
returned
Chetham
,
"
and
have
placed
him
in
security
in
Ordsall
cave
,
you
will
admit
that
you
have
done
me
wrong
.
<EOS>
""I
have
been
greatly
mistaken
in
you
,
sir
,
I
must
own
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
advancing
towards
him
,
and
extending
his
hand
.
<EOS>
But
Humphrey
Chetham
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
bowing
coldly
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Martin
Heydocke
,
and
presently
afterwards
the
tramp
of
his
horse
's
feet
was
heard
crossing
the
drawbridge
.

XIX

<EOS>
—
THE
DISCOVERYTendering
his
arm
to
Fawkes
,
who
was
almost
too
feeble
to
walk
unsupported
,
Catesby
led
him
slowly
to
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
it
,
they
met
Viviana
,
in
a
state
bordering
upon
distraction
,
but
her
distress
was
speedily
relieved
by
their
assurances
that
the
young
merchant
had
departed
unhurt,—a
statement
immediately
afterwards
confirmed
by
the
entrance
of
Martin
Heydocke
,
charged
with
a
message
from
his
master
to
her
.
<EOS>
Without
communicating
his
design
to
the
others
,
and
,
indeed
,
almost
shunning
Viviana
,
Catesby
proceeded
to
the
outbuilding
where
he
had
deposited
Garnet
.
<EOS>
He
found
him
in
great
pain
,
and
praying
fervently
to
be
released
from
his
suffering
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
despair
,
father
,
"
said
Catesby
,
in
as
cheerful
a
tone
as
he
could
assume
,
"
the
worst
is
over
.
<EOS>
Viviana
is
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
has
escaped
,
and
is
within
a
short
distance
of
us
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
is
fully
able
to
undertake
a
journey
of
any
distance
.
<EOS>
You
are
our
sole
concern
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
assured
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
exercise
the
slight
surgical
skill
I
possess
in
your
behalf
,
that
you
will
be
able
to
accompany
us
.
<EOS>
""Do
with
me
what
you
please
,
my
son
,
"
groaned
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
my
case
is
as
desperate
as
I
believe
it
,
I
entreat
you
not
to
bestow
any
further
care
upon
me
,
and
,
above
all
,
not
to
expose
yourself
to
risk
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
Our
enemies
are
sure
to
pursue
us,—and
what
matter
if
I
am
captured
?
<EOS>
They
will
wreak
their
vengeance
on
a
worthless
carcass,—for
<EOS>
such
I
shall
soon
be
.
<EOS>
But
it
would
double
the
anguish
I
now
endure
,
if
you
and
Fawkes
were
to
fall
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
Go
,
then
,
and
leave
me
here
to
perish
.
<EOS>
My
dying
moments
will
be
cheered
by
the
conviction
that
the
great
enterprise
—
for
which
alone
I
desire
to
live
—
will
not
be
unaccomplished
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
need
to
leave
you
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
nor
shall
any
consideration
induce
me
to
do
so
,
till
I
have
rendered
you
every
aid
that
circumstances
will
permit
.
<EOS>
""My
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
faintly
,
"
the
most
efficacious
balm
you
can
apply
will
be
the
certainty
that
you
are
in
safety
.
<EOS>
You
say
Viviana
is
here
.
<EOS>
Fly
with
Fawkes
,
and
leave
me
to
her
care
.
<EOS>
""She
must
go
with
us
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
uneasily
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
;
"
her
presence
will
only
endanger
you
.
<EOS>
She
must
not
go
.
<EOS>
And
you
must
abandon
all
hopes
of
an
union
with
her
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
as
soon
abandon
the
great
design
itself
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
moodily
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
persist
in
this
,
you
will
ruin
it
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
her
no
more
.
<EOS>
Bend
your
thoughts
exclusively
on
the
one
grand
object
,
and
be
what
you
are
chosen
to
be
,
the
defender
and
deliverer
of
our
holy
Church
.
<EOS>
""I
would
gladly
act
as
you
advise
me
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
I
am
spell
-
bound
by
this
maiden
.
<EOS>
""This
is
idle
from
you
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Separate
yourself
from
her
,
and
you
will
soon
regain
your
former
mastery
over
yourself
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
well
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
the
effort
,
at
least
,
shall
be
made
.
<EOS>
But
her
large
possessions
,
which
would
be
so
useful
to
our
cause
,
and
which
,
if
I
wedded
her
,
would
be
wholly
devoted
to
it,—think
of
what
we
lose
,
father
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
thought
of
it
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
but
the
consideration
does
not
alter
my
opinion
:
and
if
I
possess
any
authority
over
you
,
I
strictly
enjoin
you
not
to
proceed
farther
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Viviana
never
can
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
shall
be
,
nevertheless
,
"
muttered
Catesby
,
"
and
before
many
hours
have
elapsed,—if
not
by
her
own
free
will
,
by
force
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
shown
myself
obedient
to
your
commands
,
father
,
"
he
added
aloud
,
"
and
I
shall
not
transgress
them
now
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
keep
you
in
this
disposition
,
my
dear
son
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
,
with
a
look
of
distrust
:
"
and
let
me
recommend
you
to
remove
yourself
as
soon
as
possible
out
of
the
way
of
temptation
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
<EOS>
muttered
an
affirmative
,
and
taking
Garnet
in
his
arms
,
conveyed
him
carefully
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
placing
him
on
a
couch
,
examined
his
wounds
,
which
were
not
so
serious
as
either
he
or
the
sufferer
imagined
,
and
with
no
despicable
skill
—
for
the
experiences
of
a
soldier
's
life
had
given
him
some
practice
—
bandaged
his
broken
arm
,
and
fomented
his
bruises
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Garnet
felt
so
much
easier
,
that
he
entreated
Catesby
to
send
Viviana
to
him
,
and
to
make
preparations
for
his
own
immediate
departure
.
<EOS>
Feigning
acquiescence
,
Catesby
quitted
the
room
,
but
with
no
intention
of
complying
with
the
request
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
he
felt
must
be
lost
if
he
would
execute
his
dark
design
,
and
,
after
revolving
many
wild
expedients
,
an
idea
occurred
to
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
to
lure
Viviana
to
the
cave
where
Father
Oldcorne
was
concealed
;
and
he
knew
enough
of
the
pliant
disposition
of
the
latter
to
be
certain
he
would
assent
to
his
scheme
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
this
plan
occur
to
him
than
he
hurried
to
the
cell
,
and
found
the
priest
,
as
Chetham
had
stated
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
foreseen
,
it
required
little
persuasion
to
induce
Oldcorne
to
lend
his
assistance
to
the
forced
marriage
,
and
he
only
feared
the
decided
opposition
they
should
encounter
from
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Fear
<EOS>
nothing
,
then
,
father
,
"
said
Catesby
;
"
in
this
solitary
spot
no
one
will
hear
her
cries
.
<EOS>
Whatever
resistance
she
may
make
,
perform
the
ceremony
,
and
leave
the
consequences
to
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
plan
is
desperate
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Oldcorne
,
"
but
so
are
our
fortunes
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
Viviana
will
not
hear
reason
,
we
have
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
You
swear
that
if
you
are
once
wedded
to
her
,
all
her
possessions
shall
be
devoted
to
the
furtherance
of
the
great
cause
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
,
father
—
I
swear
it
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
fervently
.
"Enough
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
it
is
done
,
the
better
.
<EOS>
"It
was
then
agreed
between
them
that
the
plan
least
likely
to
excite
suspicion
would
be
for
Oldcorne
to
proceed
to
the
Hall
,
and
under
some
plea
prevail
upon
Viviana
to
return
with
him
to
the
cave
.
<EOS>
Acting
upon
this
arrangement
,
they
left
the
cell
together
,
shaping
their
course
under
the
trees
to
avoid
observation
;
and
while
Oldcorne
repaired
to
the
Hall
,
Catesby
proceeded
to
the
stable
,
and
saddling
the
only
steed
left
,
rode
back
to
the
cave
,
and
concealing
the
animal
behind
the
brushwood
,
entered
the
excavation
.
<EOS>
Some
time
elapsed
before
the
others
arrived
,
and
as
in
his
present
feverish
state
of
mind
moments
appeared
ages
,
the
suspense
was
almost
intolerable
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
heard
footsteps
approaching
,
and
,
with
a
beating
heart
,
distinguished
the
voice
of
Viviana
.
<EOS>
The
place
was
buried
in
profound
darkness
;
but
Oldcorne
struck
a
light
,
and
set
fire
to
a
candle
in
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
The
feeble
glimmer
diffused
by
it
was
not
sufficient
to
penetrate
the
recesses
of
the
cavern
;
and
Catesby
,
who
stood
at
the
farther
extremity
,
was
completely
sheltered
from
observation
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
father
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
seating
herself
with
her
back
towards
Catesby
,
upon
the
stone
bench
once
used
by
the
unfortunate
prophetess
,
"
I
would
learn
the
communication
you
desire
to
make
to
me
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
something
of
importance
since
you
would
not
disclose
it
at
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
""It
is
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
,
who
could
scarcely
conceal
his
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
brought
you
hither
,
where
I
am
sure
we
shall
be
uninterrupted
,
to
confer
with
you
on
a
subject
nearest
my
heart
.
<EOS>
Your
lamented
father
being
taken
from
us
,
I
,
as
his
spiritual
adviser
,
aware
of
his
secret
wishes
and
intentions
,
conceive
myself
entitled
to
assume
his
place
.
<EOS>
""I
consider
you
in
the
light
of
a
father
,
dear
sir
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
and
will
follow
your
advice
as
implicitly
as
I
would
that
of
him
I
have
lost
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
I
find
you
so
tractable
,
child
,
"
returned
Oldcorne
,
reassured
by
her
manner
,
"
I
will
no
longer
hesitate
to
declare
the
motive
I
had
in
bringing
you
hither
.
<EOS>
You
will
recollect
that
I
have
of
late
strongly
opposed
your
intention
of
retiring
to
a
convent
.
<EOS>
""I
know
it
,
father
,
"
interrupted
Viviana
;
"
but——""Hear
me
out
,
"
continued
Oldcorne
;
"
recent
events
have
strengthened
my
disapproval
of
the
step
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
called
upon
to
active
duties
,
and
must
take
your
share
in
the
business
of
life,—must
struggle
and
suffer
like
others,—and
not
shrink
from
the
burthen
imposed
upon
you
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
shrink
from
it
,
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
:
"
and
if
I
were
equal
to
the
active
life
you
propose
,
I
would
not
hesitate
to
embrace
it
,
but
I
feel
I
should
sink
under
it
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
if
you
had
one
near
you
who
could
afford
you
that
support
which
feeble
woman
ever
requires
,
"
returned
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
mean
you
,
father
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Viviana
,
fixing
her
dark
eyes
full
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"That
you
must
marry
,
daughter
,
"
returned
Oldcorne
,

""And

was
it
to
tell
me
this
that
you
brought
me

<EOS>
asked
Viviana
,
in
a
slightly
offended
tone
.
<EOS>
"It
was

daughter
,

replied
Oldcorne
;
"
but
I
have
not
yet
done

<EOS>
It
is
not
only
needful
you
should
marry

your
choice
must
be
such
as
I

represent
your

""You

find
me

doubt
not

remarked
Viviana
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"I
have
already
found
one

returned
Oldcorne
:
"
a
gentleman

Viviana

""I
will
not
affect
to
misunderstand
you

she
replied
;

you
mean
Mr.
Catesby

""You
have
guessed
aright
,
dear

rejoined
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
I
had
made
myself
sufficiently
intelligible
on
this
point
before

father

she
returned
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
;
"
but
you
are
no
longer

as
I
have
just
laboured
to
convince

was
formerly
discussed

asked
Oldcorne

<EOS>
"They
are
numberless

"
replied
Viviana
;
"
but
it
is
useless
to
particularize
them
.
<EOS>
I
must
pray
you
to
change
the
conversation

you
will
compel
me
to
quit
you

<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
daughter

if
you
thus
obstinately
shut
your
ears
to
reason

I
must
use
very
different
language
towards
you

<EOS>
Armed
with
parental
authority
,
I
shall
exact
obedience
to
my
commands

<EOS>
""I
can
not

Viviana
,
bursting
into
tears,—"indeed

indeed
I

""He
who
has
robbed
you
of
it
is
a
heretic

rejoined
Oldcorne
,
sternly
,
"

therefore
your

is
out
of

me

""Never

"
replied
Viviana
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
would
never
have
enforced
my
compliance

I
dread
no

thus
impiously
pronounced

You
are
overstepping
the
bounds
of
your
priestly
office

sir

<EOS>
Farewell
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
she
moved
to
depart
,
a
strong
grasp
was
laid
on
her
arm
,
and
turning
,
she
beheld
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
here
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
great
alarm

replied
Catesby

At

you
are
in
my
power

Viviana

""I
would
fain
misunderstand
you

she
rejoined
,
trembling
;

but
your
looks
terrify
me

You
mean
no
<EOS>
violence?""I
mean
that
Father
Oldcorne

we
d
<EOS>

that
too

Catesby
,
sternly
.
"Monster
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
Viviana
,
"
you
will
not,—dare
not
commit
this
foul
offence

<EOS>
And
if
you
dare
,
Father
Oldcorne
will
not
assist
you

<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
means
that
sign
?
<EOS>
I
can
not
be
mistaken
in
you

You
can

acting

from
him!—save
me

<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
priest
kept
aloof
,
and
taking
a
missal
from
his
vest
,
hastily
turned
over
the
leaves

<EOS>
Viviana
saw
that
her
appeal
to
him
was
vain
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
go
!

she
shrieked
,
struggling
with
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
force
me
to

d
you
whether
I
will
or
not

I
will
die
rather
than
consent

<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
I
say
?
<EOS>
Help!—help
!
"
<EOS>
And
she
made
the
cavern
ring
with
her
screams
.
<EOS>
"Heed
her
<EOS>
not
,
father
,
"
shouted
Catesby
,
who
still
held
her
fast
,
"
but
proceed
with
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
"Oldcorne
,
however
,
appeared
irresolute
,
and
Viviana
perceiving
it
,
redoubled
her
cries
.
<EOS>
"This
will
be
no
marriage
,
father
,
"
she
said
,
"
even
if
you
proceed
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
protest
against
it
to
all
the
world
,
and
you
will
be
deprived
of
your
priestly
office
for
your
share
in
so
infamous
a
transaction

<EOS>
""You
will
think
otherwise
anon

replied
Oldcorne
,
advancing
towards
them
with
the
missal
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"If
it
be
no
marriage

"
observed
Catesby
,
significantly
,
"
the
time
will
come
when
you
may
desire
to
have
the
ceremony
repeated
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
altering
her
manner
,
as
if
she
had
taken
a
sudden
resolution
,
"
one
word
before
you
proceed
with
your
atrocious
purpose
,
which
must
end
in
misery
to
us
all

<EOS>
There
are
reasons
why
you
can
never

d
me
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
so
,
my
son
?
"
asked
Oldcorne
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
knows
not
what
she
says
.
<EOS>
Proceed
,
father
.
<EOS>
""I
have
proofs
that
will
confound
you
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
breaking
from
him
.
<EOS>
And
darting
towards
the
light
,
she
took
from
her
bosom
the
packet
given
her
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
tore
it
open
.
<EOS>
A
letter
was
within
it
,
and
a
miniature
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
letter
,
she
cast
her
eye
rapidly
over
its
contents
,
and
then
looking
up
,
exclaimed
in
accents
of
delirious
joy
,
"
Saved
!
<EOS>
saved
!
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
,
this
man
is
married
already

<EOS>
"Catesby
,
who
had
watched
her
proceedings
in
silent
astonishment
,
and
was
now
advancing
towards
her
,
recoiled
as
if
a
thunderbolt
had
fallen
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
this
be
true
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
priest
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
your
own
eyes
convince
you
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
handing
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"I
am
satisfied
,
"
returned
Oldcorne
,
after
he
had
glanced
at
it
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
both
been
spared
the
commission
of
a
great
crime
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Catesby
,
it
appears
from
this
letter
that
you
have
a
wife
living
in
Spain
.
<EOS>
""It
is
useless
to
deny
it
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
were
ignorant
of
the
matter
,
the
offence
(
if
any
)
would
have
lain
wholly
at
my
door
;
nor
should
I
have
repented
of
it
,
if
it
had
enabled
me
to
achieve
the
object
I
have
in
view
.
<EOS>
""Thank
<EOS>
Heaven
it
has
gone
no
further
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
Daughter
,
I
humbly
entreat
your
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
came
that
packet
in
your
possession
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Catesby
fiercely
of
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"It
was
given
me
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Guy
Fawkes
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Has
he
betrayed
his
friend?""He
has
proved
himself
your
best
friend
,
by
preventing
you
from
committing
a
crime
,
which
would
have
entailed
wretchedness
on
yourself
and
me
,
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"I
have
done
with
him
,
and
with
all
of
you
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
with
a
fierce
glance
at
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
Henceforth
,
pursue
your
projects
alone
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
no
further
assistance
from
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
serve
the
Spaniard
.
<EOS>
Englishmen
are
not
to
be
trusted
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
cavern
,
and
seeking
his
horse
,
mounted
him
,
and
rode
off
at
full
speed
.
"How
<EOS>
shall
I
obtain
your
forgiveness
for
my
conduct
in
this
culpable
affair
,
dear
daughter
?
"
<EOS>
said
Oldcorne
,
with
an
imploring
look
at
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
joining
me
in
thanksgivings
to
the
Virgin
for
my
deliverance
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
prostrating
herself
before
the
stone
cross
.
<EOS>
Oldcorne
knelt
beside
her
,
and
they
continued
for
some
time
in
earnest
prayer
.
<EOS>
They
then
arose
,
and
quitting
the
cave
,
proceeded
to
the
Hall

—
THE
DEPARTURE
FROM
THE
HALLGuy
Fawkes
was
as
much
surprised
to
hear
of
the
sudden
departure
of
Catesby
as
he
was
concerned
at
the
cause
;
but
he
still
thought
it
probable
he
would
return
.
<EOS>
In
this
expectation
,
however
,
he
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
day
wore
on
,
and
no
one
came
.
<EOS>
The
uncertainty
in
which
Fawkes
was
kept
,
added
to
his
unwillingness
to
leave
Garnet
,
still
detained
him
,
in
spite
of
the
risk
he
ran
,
at
the
Hall
;
and
it
was
only
when
urged
by
Viviana
that
he
began
seriously
to
reflect
whither
he
should
bend
his
steps
.
<EOS>
Towards
evening
,
Garnet
was
so
much
better
,
that
he
was
able
to
sit
up
,
and
he
passed
some
hours
in
conference
with
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
I
do
not
suffer
a
relapse
,
"
he
observed
to
the
latter
,
"
I
will
set
out
with
Guy
Fawkes
to
-
morrow
,
and
we
will
proceed
by
easy
stages
to
London
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
but
approve
your
resolution
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Oldcorne
;
"
for
though
so
long
a
journey
may
be
inconvenient
,
and
retard
your
recovery
,
yet
every
hour
you
remain
here
is
fraught
with
additional
peril
.
<EOS>
I
will
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
We
shall
both
be
safer
in
the
capital
;
and
perhaps
Viviana
,
now
she
will
be
no
longer
exposed
to
the
persecutions
of
Catesby
,
will
form
one
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
""I
should
not
wonder
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
deeply
concerned
if
Catesby
has
really
abandoned
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
think
it
.
<EOS>
I
did
all
I
could
to
dissuade
him
from
prosecuting
this
union
,
knowing
how
hopeless
it
was
,
and
little
thinking
he
would
be
rash
enough
to
seek
to
accomplish
it
by
force
,
or
that
he
would
find
an
assistant
in
you
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
no
more
about
it
<EOS>
,
father
,
I
entreat
you
,
"
rejoined
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
The
scheme
failed
,
as
it
deserved
to
do
;
and
I
sincerely
repent
the
share
I
was
induced
by
Catesby
's
artful
representations
to
take
in
it
.
<EOS>
If
we
have
lost
our
leader
we
have
still
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
is
a
host
in
himself
,
and
as
true
as
the
steel
that
hangs
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
""We
can
not
spare
Catesby
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
With
many
faults
,
he
has
one
redeeming
quality
,
courage
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sorry
he
has
been
thwarted
in
his
present
scheme
,
as
if
he
returns
to
us
,
as
I
doubt
not
he
will
,
it
will
fix
his
mind
steadily
on
the
one
object
,
which
should
be
ever
before
it
.
<EOS>
Give
me
your
arm
,
father
.
<EOS>
I
am
glad
to
find
I
can
walk
,
though
feebly
.
<EOS>
That
is
well
,
"
he
added
,
as
they
emerged
upon
the
gallery
;
"
I
shall
be
able
to
reach
Viviana
's
chamber
without
further
assistance
.
<EOS>
Do
you
descend
,
and
see
that
Martin
Heydocke
is
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
obedience
to
the
injunctions
of
his
superior
<EOS>
,
Oldcorne
went
in
search
of
Martin
Heydocke
,
who
had
been
stationed
in
the
court
-
yard
to
give
timely
notice
of
any
hostile
approach
;
but
not
finding
him
there
,
he
proceeded
towards
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
Garnet
,
meanwhile
,
had
reached
the
door
of
Viviana
's
chamber
,
which
was
slightly
ajar
,
and
he
was
about
to
pass
through
it
,
when
he
perceived
that
she
was
on
her
knees
before
Guy
Fawkes
,
whom
she
was
addressing
in
the
most
passionate
terms
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
seated
at
a
table
,
with
his
head
upon
his
hand
,
in
a
thoughtful
posture
.
<EOS>
Surprised
at
the
sight
,
and
curious
to
hear
what
Viviana
could
be
saying
,
Garnet
drew
back
to
listen
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
you
quit
this
house
,
"
were
the
first
words
that
caught
the
listener
's
ear
,
"
<EOS>
we
shall
never
meet
again
;
and
oh
!
<EOS>
let
me
have
the
consolation
of
thinking
that
,
in
return
for
the
devoted
attachment
you
have
shown
me
,
and
the
dangers
from
which
you
have
preserved
me
,
I
have
preserved
you
from
one
equally
imminent
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
from
whatever
motive
,
has
abandoned
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
Do
you
act
likewise
,
and
the
whole
dreadful
scheme
will
fall
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
""Catesby
can
not
abandon
it
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
bound
by
ties
that
no
human
power
can
sunder
.
<EOS>
And
,
however
he
may
estrange
himself
from
us
now
,
when
the
time
for
action
arrives
,
rest
assured
he
will
not
be
absent
.
<EOS>
"Illustration"It
may
be
so
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
but
I
deny
that
the
oath
either
he
or
you
have
taken
is
binding
.
<EOS>
The
deed
you
have
sworn
to
do
is
evil
,
and
no
vow
,
however
solemnly
pronounced
,
can
compel
you
to
commit
crime
.
<EOS>
Avoid
this
sin
—
avoid
further
connexion
with
those
who
would
work
your
undoing
,
and
do
not
stain
your
soul
with
guilt
from
which
it
will
never
be
cleansed
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
seek
in
vain
to
move
me
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
My
purpose
is
unalterable
.
<EOS>
The
tempest
that
clears
away
the
pestilence
destroys
many
innocent
lives
,
but
it
is
not
the
less
wholesome
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
Our
unhappy
land
is
choked
with
the
pestilence
of
heresy
,
and
must
be
freed
from
it
,
cost
what
it
will
,
and
suffer
who
may
.
<EOS>
The
wrongs
of
the
English
Catholics
imperatively
demand
redress
;
and
,
since
it
is
denied
us
,
we
must
take
it
.
<EOS>
Oppression
can
go
no
farther
;
nor
endurance
hold
out
longer
.
<EOS>
If
this
blow
be
not
struck
we
shall
have
no
longer
a
religion
.
<EOS>
And
how
comes
it
,
Viviana
,
that
you
,
a
zealous
Catholic
,
whose
father
perished
by
these
very
oppressors
,
and
who
are
yourself
in
danger
from
them
,
can
seek
to
turn
me
from
my
purpose?""Because
<EOS>
I
know
it
is
wrongful
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
desire
to
avenge
the
death
of
my
slaughtered
father
,
still
less
to
see
our
religion
furthered
by
the
dreadful
means
you
propose
.
<EOS>
In
his
own
due
season
,
the
Lord
will
redress
our
wrongs
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Lord
has
appointed
me
one
of
the
ministers
of
his
vengeance
,
"
cried
Fawkes
,
in
a
tone
of
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
deceive
yourself
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
"
it
is
not
by
Heaven
,
but
by
the
powers
of
darkness
,
that
you
are
incited
to
this
deed
.
<EOS>
Do
not
persevere
in
this
fatal
course
,
"
she
continued
,
clasping
her
hands
together
,
and
gazing
imploringly
in
his
face
,
"
do
not
<EOS>
—
do
not!"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
continued
in
the
same
attitude
as
before
,
with
his
gaze
turned
upwards
,
and
apparently
lost
in
thought
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
no
power
to
move
you
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
<EOS>
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
you
are
lost
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
it
is
Heaven
's
will
,
I
am
,
"
answered
Fawkes
;
"
but
at
least
I
believe
I
am
acting
rightly
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
rest
assured
you
are
so
,
my
son
,
"
cried
Garnet
,
throwing
open
the
door
,
and
stepping
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
overheard
your
conversation
,
and
I
applaud
your
resolution
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
need
have
no
fears
of
me
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
lightly
undertake
a
project
;
but
once
embarked
in
it
nothing
can
turn
me
aside
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
this
case
your
determination
is
wisely
formed
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
;
"
and
if
Viviana
will
ever
give
me
an
opportunity
of
fully
discussing
the
matter
,
I
am
sure
I
can
satisfy
her
<EOS>
you
are
in
the
right
.
<EOS>
""I
will
discuss
it
with
you
whenever
you
think
proper
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
no
arguments
will
ever
convince
me
that
your
project
is
approved
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""Let
it
pass
now
,
daughter
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
;
"
enough
has
been
said
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
I
came
hither
to
tell
Guy
Fawkes
,
that
if
our
enemies
permit
us
to
pass
the
night
without
molestation
(
as
Heaven
grant
they
may
!
)
<EOS>
I
think
I
shall
be
strong
enough
to
set
out
with
him
to
-
morrow
,
when
I
propose
we
should
journey
together
to
London
.
<EOS>
""Agreed
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Father
<EOS>
Oldcorne
will
accompany
us
,
"
pursued
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
too
,
will
go
with
you
,
if
you
will
permit
me
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
remain
here
;
and
I
have
no
further
fears
of
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
told
me
my
future
fate
was
strangely
mixed
up
with
that
of
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
how
it
may
be
,
but
I
will
not
abandon
him
while
there
is
a
hope
to
cling
to
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
Radcliffe
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
coldly
,
"
deeply
as
I
feel
the
interest
you
take
in
me
<EOS>
,
I
think
it
right
to
tell
you
that
no
efforts
you
can
use
will
shake
me
from
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
If
I
live
,
I
will
execute
my
design
.
<EOS>
""While
I
live
,
I
will
urge
you
to
it
,
"
remarked
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
while
I
live
,
I
will
dissuade
you
from
it
,
"
added
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
see
who
will
obtain
the
victory
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
shall
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
smiling
confidently
.
<EOS>
"Hear
me
further
,
"
continued
Viviana
;
"
I
do
not
doubt
that
your
zeal
is
disinterested
;
yet
still
,
your
mode
of
life
,
and
the
difficulties
in
which
you
are
placed
,
may
not
unnaturally
influence
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
That
this
may
no
longer
be
the
case
,
I
here
place
part
of
my
fortune
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
I
require
little
or
nothing
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
,
if
possible
,
save
one
to
whom
I
owe
so
much
,
and
whom
I
value
so
much
,
from
destruction
.
<EOS>
""I
fully
appreciate
your
generosity
—
to
give
it
its
lightest
term
—
Viviana
,
"
returned
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
a
voice
of
deep
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
Under
any
circumstances
I
should
reject
it,—under
the
present
,
I
do
so
the
more
positively
,
because
the
offer
,
kind
as
it
is
,
seems
to
imply
that
my
poverty
leads
me
to
act
contrary
to
my
principles
.
<EOS>
Gold
has
no
power
over
me
:
I
regard
it
as
dross
;
and
when
I
could
easily
have
won
it
,
I
neglected
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
As
no
reward
would
ever
induce
me
to
commit
an
action
my
conscience
disapproved
,
so
none
will
deter
me
from
a
purpose
which
I
regard
as
my
duty
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
no
longer
question
your
motives
,
or
oppose
your
plan
,
but
will
pray
Heaven
to
open
your
eyes
to
the
truth
.
<EOS>
""Your
conduct
is
in
all
respects
worthy
of
you
,
daughter
,
"
observed
Garnet
,
kindly
.
<EOS>
"You
have
rejected
one
offer
,
"
continued
Viviana
,
looking
at
Fawkes
;
"
but
I
trust
you
will
not
decline
that
I
am
about
to
propose
to
you
.
<EOS>
""What
is
it
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Fawkes
,
in
some
surprise
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
is
that
I
may
be
permitted
to
regard
you
as
a
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
with
some
hesitation
.
<EOS>
"
Having
lost
my
own
father
,
I
feel
I
need
some
protector
,
and
I
would
gladly
make
choice
of
you
,
if
you
will
accept
the
office
.
<EOS>
""I
willingly
accede
to
your
request
,
and
am
much
flattered
by
it
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
homeless
man
,
and
a
friendless
,
and
the
affection
of
such
a
being
as
yourself
will
fill
up
the
only
void
in
my
heart
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
wedded
to
the
great
cause
.
<EOS>
I
can
never
be
more
to
you
than
a
father
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
I
ask
nothing
more
,
"
she
replied
,
blushing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
thus
arranged
the
terms
upon
which
we
shall
travel
,
"
observed
Garnet
,
with
a
smile
,
"
nothing
is
needed
but
to
prepare
for
our
journey
.
<EOS>
We
start
early
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
be
ready
at
daybreak
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
am
ready
now
,
"
added
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
In
my
opinion
,
we
run
great
risk
in
remaining
here
another
night
.
<EOS>
But
be
it
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
Father
Oldcorne
,
who
with
a
countenance
of
great
alarm
informed
them
he
could
nowhere
find
Martin
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
suspect
any
treachery
on
his
part
?
"
asked
Garnet
of
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
always
found
him
trustworthy
,
"
she
answered
;
"
and
his
father
was
my
father
's
oldest
servant
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
think
he
would
betray
us
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
must
admit
his
disappearance
at
this
juncture
looks
suspicious
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
my
strength
were
equal
to
it
,
"
returned
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
I
would
keep
watch
throughout
the
night
;
but
that
might
prevent
me
from
accompanying
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
My
advice
,
I
repeat
,
is
—
to
set
out
at
once
.
<EOS>
"This
opinion
,
however
,
was
overruled
by
Garnet
and
Viviana
,
who
did
not
think
the
danger
so
urgent
,
and
attributed
the
absence
of
Martin
Heydocke
to
some
unimportant
cause
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
made
no
further
remonstrance
,
and
it
was
agreed
they
should
start
,
as
originally
proposed
,
at
daybreak
.
<EOS>
The
party
then
separated
,
and
Viviana
wandered
alone
over
the
old
house
,
taking
a
farewell
,
which
she
felt
would
be
her
last
,
of
every
familiar
object
.
<EOS>
Few
things
were
as
she
had
known
them
,
but
even
in
their
present
forlorn
state
they
were
dear
to
her
;
and
the
rooms
she
trod
,
<EOS>
though
dismantled
,
were
the
same
she
had
occupied
in
childhood
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
pang
more
acute
to
a
sensitive
nature
than
that
occasioned
by
quitting
an
abode
or
spot
endeared
by
early
recollections
and
associations
,
to
which
we
feel
a
strong
presentiment
we
shall
never
return
.
<EOS>
Viviana
experienced
this
feeling
in
its
full
force
,
and
she
lingered
in
each
room
as
if
she
had
not
the
power
to
leave
it
.
<EOS>
Her
emotions
at
length
became
so
overpowering
,
that
to
relieve
them
she
strolled
forth
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Here
,
new
objects
awakened
her
attention
,
and
recalled
happier
times
with
painful
distinctness
.
<EOS>
Twilight
was
fast
deepening
,
and
,
viewed
through
this
dim
and
softened
medium
,
everything
looked
as
of
old
,
and
produced
a
tightening
and
stifling
sensation
in
her
breast
,
that
nothing
but
a
flood
of
tears
could
remove
.
<EOS>
The
flowers
yielded
forth
their
richest
scents
,
and
the
whole
scene
was
such
as
she
had
often
beheld
it
in
times
long
ago
,
when
sorrow
was
wholly
unknown
to
her
.
<EOS>
Perfumes
,
it
is
well
known
,
exercise
a
singular
influence
over
the
memory
.
<EOS>
A
particular
odour
will
frequently
call
up
an
event
and
a
long
train
of
circumstances
connected
with
the
time
when
it
was
first
inhaled
.
<EOS>
Without
being
aware
whence
it
arose
,
Viviana
felt
a
tide
of
recollections
pressing
upon
her
,
which
she
would
have
willingly
repressed
,
but
which
it
was
out
of
her
power
to
control
.
<EOS>
Her
tears
flowed
abundantly
,
and
at
length
,
with
a
heart
somewhat
lightened
of
its
load
,
she
arose
from
the
bench
on
which
she
had
thrown
herself
,
and
proceeded
along
a
walk
to
gather
a
few
flowers
as
memorials
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
she
reached
the
further
end
of
the
garden
,
and
was
stooping
to
pluck
a
spray
of
some
fragrant
shrub
,
when
she
perceived
the
figure
of
a
man
behind
a
tree
at
a
little
distance
from
her
.
<EOS>
From
his
garb
,
which
was
that
of
a
soldier
,
she
instantly
knew
he
was
an
enemy
,
and
,
though
greatly
alarmed
,
she
had
the
courage
not
to
scream
,
but
breaking
off
the
branch
,
she
uttered
a
careless
exclamation
,
and
slowly
retraced
her
steps
.
<EOS>
She
half
expected
to
hear
that
the
soldier
was
following
her
,
and
prepared
to
start
off
at
full
speed
to
the
house
;
but
,
deceived
by
her
manner
,
he
did
not
stir
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
end
of
the
walk
,
she
could
not
resist
the
inclination
to
look
back
,
and
glancing
over
her
shoulder
,
perceived
the
man
watching
her
.
<EOS>
But
as
she
moved
,
he
instantly
withdrew
his
head
.
<EOS>
Her
first
step
on
reaching
the
house
was
to
close
and
fasten
the
door
;
her
next
to
hasten
to
Guy
Fawkes
's
chamber
,
where
she
found
him
,
together
with
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
All
three
were
astounded
at
the
intelligence
,
agreeing
that
an
attack
was
intended
,
and
that
a
large
force
was
,
in
all
probability
,
concealed
in
the
garden
awaiting
only
the
arrival
of
night
to
surprise
and
seize
them
.
<EOS>
The
disappearance
of
the
younger
Heydocke
was
no
longer
a
mystery
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
secured
and
carried
off
by
the
hostile
party
,
to
prevent
him
from
giving
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
emergency
was
a
fearful
one
,
and
it
excited
consternation
amongst
all
except
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
preserved
his
calmness
.
<EOS>
"I
foresaw
we
should
be
attacked
to
-
night
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
am
therefore
not
wholly
unprepared
.
<EOS>
Our
only
chance
is
to
steal
out
unobserved
;
for
resistance
would
be
in
vain
,
as
their
force
is
probably
numerous
,
and
I
am
as
helpless
as
an
infant
,
while
Father
Garnet
's
broken
arm
precludes
any
assistance
from
him
.
<EOS>
The
subterranean
passage
leading
from
the
oratory
to
the
further
side
of
the
moat
having
been
stopped
up
by
the
pursuivant
and
his
band
,
it
will
be
necessary
to
cross
the
drawbridge
,
and
as
soon
as
it
grows
sufficiently
dark
,
we
must
make
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
horses
,
and
must
trust
to
our
own
exertions
for
safety
.
<EOS>
Catesby
would
now
be
invaluable
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
his
custom
to
desert
his
friends
at
the
season
of
their
greatest
need
.
<EOS>
""Great
<EOS>
as
is
my
danger
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
"
<EOS>
I
would
rather
,
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
that
he
were
absent
,
than
owe
my
preservation
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
fears
for
myself
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
my
only
fears
are
for
you
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
of
intense
anxiety
was
now
passed
by
the
party
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
restless
and
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Oldcorne
betrayed
his
agitation
by
unavailing
lamentations
,
by
listening
to
every
sound
,
and
by
constantly
rushing
to
the
windows
to
reconnoitre
,
until
he
was
checked
by
Fawkes
,
who
represented
to
him
the
folly
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
though
ill
at
ease
,
did
not
allow
her
terror
to
appear
,
but
endeavoured
to
imitate
the
immoveable
demeanour
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
always
became
more
collected
in
proportion
to
the
danger
by
which
he
was
threatened
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
the
time
above
mentioned
,
it
had
become
quite
dark
,
and
desiring
his
companions
to
follow
him
,
Guy
Fawkes
drew
his
sword
,
and
,
grasping
Viviana
's
hand
,
led
the
way
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
Before
opening
the
door
,
he
listened
intently
,
and
,
hearing
no
sound
,
issued
cautiously
forth
.
<EOS>
The
party
had
scarcely
gained
the
centre
of
the
court
,
when
a
caliver
was
discharged
at
them
,
which
,
though
it
did
no
damage
,
served
as
a
signal
to
the
rest
of
their
foes
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
had
never
relinquished
his
hold
of
Viviana
,
now
pressed
forward
as
rapidly
as
his
strength
would
permit
,
and
the
two
priests
followed
.
<EOS>
But
loud
shouts
were
raised
on
the
drawbridge
,
and
it
was
evident
it
was
occupied
by
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
Uncertain
what
to
do
,
Guy
Fawkes
halted
,
and
was
about
to
return
to
the
house
,
when
a
shout
from
behind
told
him
their
retreat
was
intercepted
.
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
attempt
to
force
a
passage
across
the
drawbridge
,
or
to
surrender
at
discretion
;
and
though
Guy
Fawkes
would
not
at
other
seasons
have
hesitated
to
embrace
the
former
alternative
,
he
knew
that
his
strength
was
not
equal
to
it
now
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
internally
resolving
not
to
yield
himself
with
life
,
and
supporting
Viviana
,
who
clung
closely
to
him
,
the
clatter
of
hoofs
was
heard
rapidly
approaching
along
the
avenue
,
and
presently
afterwards
two
horsemen
galloped
at
full
speed
toward
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
The
noise
had
likewise
attracted
the
attention
of
the
enemy
;
who
,
apprehensive
of
a
rescue
,
prepared
to
stop
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
tremendous
pace
of
the
riders
rendered
this
impossible
.
<EOS>
A
few
blows
were
exchanged
,
a
few
shots
fired
,
and
they
had
crossed
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
"Who
goes
there
?
"
shouted
Guy
Fawkes
,
as
the
horsemen
approached
him
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
voice
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
cried
the
foremost
,
whose
tones
proclaimed
it
was
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
here
,
"
he
cried
,
reining
in
his
steed
.
<EOS>
"Where
is
Viviana
?
"
<EOS>
vociferated
his
companion
,
who
was
no
other
than
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Here
—
here
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
With
the
quickness
of
thought
,
the
young
merchant
was
by
her
side
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
placed
on
the
saddle
before
him
,
and
borne
at
a
headlong
pace
across
the
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
"Follow
<EOS>
me
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
clear
a
passage
for
you
.
<EOS>
Once
across
the
drawbridge
,
you
are
safe
.
<EOS>
A
hundred
yards
down
the
avenue
,
on
the
right
,
you
will
find
a
couple
of
horses
tied
to
a
tree
.
<EOS>
Quick
!
<EOS>
quick!"As
he
spoke
,
a
shot
whizzed
past
his
head
,
and
<EOS>
a
tumultuous
din
in
the
rear
told
that
their
pursuers
were
close
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Striking
spurs
into
his
steed
,
Catesby
dashed
forward
,
and
dealing
blows
right
and
left
,
cleared
the
drawbridge
of
its
occupants
,
many
of
whom
leaped
into
the
moat
to
escape
his
fury
.
<EOS>
His
companions
were
close
at
his
heels
,
and
got
over
the
bridge
in
safety
.
<EOS>
"Fly!—fly
!
"
cried
Catesby,—"to
the
horses
—
the
horses
!
<EOS>
I
will
check
all
pursuit
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
and
while
the
others
flew
towards
the
avenue
,
he
faced
his
opponents
,
and
making
a
desperate
charge
upon
them
,
drove
them
backwards
.
<EOS>
In
this
conflict
,
though
several
shots
were
fired
,
and
blows
aimed
at
him
on
all
sides
,
he
sustained
no
injury
,
but
succeeded
in
defending
the
bridge
sufficiently
long
to
enable
his
friends
to
mount
.
<EOS>
He
then
rode
off
at
full
speed
,
and
found
the
party
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
.
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
was
seated
on
the
same
steed
as
his
superior
.
<EOS>
After
riding
with
them
upwards
of
a
mile
,
Humphrey
Chetham
dismounted
,
and
resigning
his
horse
to
Viviana
,
bade
her
farewell
,
and
disappeared
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
to
London
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
striking
into
a
road
on
the
right
,
and
urging
his
steed
to
a
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
to
London!—to
the
Parliament
House
!
"
echoed
Fawkes
,
following
him
with
the
others
.

point
to
be

the

<EOS>
These

were
most
cruel

damnable;—by

having

—
THE
LANDING
OF
THE
POWDERTowards
<EOS>
the
close
of
the
sixth
day
after
their
departure
from
Ordsall
Hall
,
the
party
approached
the
capital
.
<EOS>
The
sun
was
setting
as
they
descended
Highgate
Hill
,
and
the
view
of
the
ancient
,
and
then
most
picturesque
city
,
was
so
enchanting
,
that
Viviana
,
who
beheld
it
for
the
first
time
,
entreated
her
companions
to
pause
for
a
few
minutes
to
allow
her
to
contemplate
it
.
<EOS>
From
the
spot
where
they
halted
,
the
country
was
completely
open
to
Clerkenwell
,
and
only
a
few
scattered
habitations
lay
between
them
and
the
old
grey
ramparts
of
the
city
,
with
their
gates
and
fortifications
,
which
were
easily
discernible
even
at
that
distance
.
<EOS>
Above
them
rose
the
massive
body
and
central
tower
of
Saint
Paul
's
cathedral,—a
structure
far
surpassing
that
which
has
succeeded
it,—while
amid
the
innumerable
gables
,
pointed
roofs
,
and
twisted
chimneys
of
the
houses
sprang
a
multitude
of
lesser
towers
and
spires
,
lending
additional
beauty
to
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Viviana
was
enraptured
,
and
,
while
gazing
on
the
prospect
,
almost
forgot
her
sorrows
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
and
Catesby
,
who
were
a
little
in
advance
of
the
others
,
turned
their
gaze
westward
,
and
the
former
observed
to
his
companion,"The
<EOS>
sun
is
setting
over
the
Parliament
House
.
<EOS>
The
sky
seems
stained
with
blood
.
<EOS>
It
looks
portentous
of
what
is
to
follow
.
<EOS>
""I
would
gladly
behold
the
explosion
from
this
hill
,
or
from
yon
heights
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
pointing
towards
Hampstead
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
a
sight
such
as
man
has
seldom
seen
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
never
live
to
witness
it
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
a
melancholy
tone
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
still
desponding
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Catesby
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
,
since
you
had
fully
recovered
from
your
wound
,
you
had
shaken
off
your
fears
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
misunderstand
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
I
shall
perish
with
our
foes
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so
?
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
plenty
of
time
to
escape
after
you
have
fired
the
train
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
attempt
it
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
in
a
sombre
voice
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
abide
the
result
in
the
vault
.
<EOS>
If
I
perish
,
it
will
be
a
glorious
death
.
<EOS>
""Better
<EOS>
live
to
see
the
regeneration
of
our
faith
,
and
our
restoration
to
our
rights
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
will
speak
of
this
hereafter
.
<EOS>
Here
comes
Garnet
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
do
you
propose
we
should
lodge
to
-
night
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
latter
,
riding
up
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
the
house
at
Lambeth
,
where
the
powder
is
deposited
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
it
be
safe
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Garnet
,
uneasily
.
"We
<EOS>
shall
be
safer
there
than
elsewhere
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
is
dark
enough
to
-
night
,
Fawkes
and
I
will
remove
a
portion
of
the
powder
.
<EOS>
But
we
are
losing
time
.
<EOS>
We
must
pass
through
the
city
before
the
gates
are
closed
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
this
suggestion
Garnet
acquiesced
,
and
calling
to
Viviana
to
follow
them,—for
,
since
his
late
atrocious
attempt
<EOS>
,
Catesby
had
not
exchanged
a
word
or
look
with
her
,
but
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
kept
sedulously
aloof,—the
whole
party
set
forward
,
and
proceeding
at
a
brisk
pace
,
soon
reached
the
walls
of
the
city
.
<EOS>
Passing
through
Cripplegate
,
they
shaped
their
course
towards
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
Viviana
was
filled
with
astonishment
at
all
she
saw
:
the
multitude
and
magnificence
of
the
shops
,
compared
with
such
as
she
had
previously
seen
;
the
crowds
in
the
streets,—for
even
at
that
hour
they
were
thronged
;
the
varied
dresses
of
the
passengers
—
the
sober
garb
of
the
merchant
,
contrasting
with
the
showy
cloak
,
the
preposterous
ruff
,
swelling
hose
,
plumed
cap
,
and
swaggering
gait
of
the
gallant
or
the
ruffler
;
the
brawls
that
were
constantly
occurring
;
the
number
of
signs
projecting
from
the
dwellings
;
all
she
witnessed
or
heard
surprised
and
amused
her
,
and
she
would
willingly
have
proceeded
at
a
slower
pace
to
indulge
her
curiosity
,
had
not
her
companions
urged
her
onward
.
<EOS>
As
they
were
crossing
Eastcheap
,
in
the
direction
of
Crooked
-
lane
,
a
man
suddenly
quitted
the
footpath
,
and
,
rushing
towards
Garnet
,
seized
his
bridle
,
and
cried,"I
arrest
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
Romish
priest
.
<EOS>
""It
is
false
,
knave
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
good
a
Protestant
as
thyself
,
and
am
just
arrived
with
my
companions
from
a
long
journey
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
companions
are
all
rank
Papists
,
"
rejoined
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
You
yourself
are
Father
Garnet
,
superior
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
,
if
I
am
not
deceived
,
the
person
next
you
is
Father
Oldcorne
,
also
of
that
order
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
wrong
you
can
easily
refute
the
charge
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
to
the
council
.
<EOS>
If
you
refuse
,
I
will
call
assistance
from
the
passengers
.
<EOS>
"Garnet
<EOS>
saw
he
was
lost
if
he
did
not
make
an
immediate
effort
at
self
-
preservation
,
and
resolving
to
be
beforehand
with
his
assailant
<EOS>
,
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice,"Help
!
<EOS>
help
!
<EOS>
my
masters
.
<EOS>
This
villain
would
rob
me
of
my
purse
.
<EOS>
""He
is
a
Romish
priest
,
"
vociferated
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"
I
call
upon
you
to
assist
me
to
arrest
him
.
"While
<EOS>
the
passengers
,
scarcely
knowing
what
to
make
of
these
contradictory
statements
,
flocked
round
them
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
was
a
little
in
advance
of
Catesby
,
rode
back
,
and
seeing
how
matters
stood
,
instantly
drew
a
petronel
,
and
with
the
butt
-
end
felled
the
stranger
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Thus
liberated
,
Garnet
struck
spurs
into
his
steed
,
and
the
whole
party
dashed
off
at
a
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
Shouts
were
raised
by
the
bystanders
,
a
few
of
whom
started
in
pursuit
,
but
the
speed
at
which
the
fugitives
rode
soon
bore
them
out
of
danger
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
they
had
reached
London
Bridge
,
and
Viviana
,
in
some
degree
recovered
from
the
fright
caused
by
the
recent
occurrence
,
ventured
to
look
around
her
.
<EOS>
She
could
scarcely
believe
she
was
crossing
a
bridge
,
so
completely
did
the
tall
houses
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
street
;
and
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
occasional
glimpses
of
the
river
caught
between
the
openings
of
these
lofty
habitations
,
she
would
have
thought
her
companions
had
mistaken
the
road
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
the
ancient
gateway
(
afterwards
denominated
Traitor
's
Tower
)
,
at
the
Southwark
side
of
the
bridge
,
she
remarked
with
a
shudder
the
dismal
array
of
heads
garnishing
its
spikes
,
and
pointing
them
out
to
Fawkes
,
cried,"Heaven
grant
yours
may
never
be
amongst
the
number!"Fawkes
<EOS>
made
no
answer
,
but
dashed
beneath
the
low
and
gloomy
arch
of
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Striking
into
a
street
on
the
right
,
the
party
skirted
the
walls
of
Saint
Saviour
's
Church
,
and
presently
drew
near
the
Globe
theatre
,
above
which
floated
its
banner
.
<EOS>
Adjoining
it
was
the
old
Bear
-
garden
—
the
savage
inmates
of
which
made
themselves
sufficiently
audible
.
<EOS>
Garnet
hastily
pointed
out
the
first
-
mentioned
place
of
amusement
to
Viviana
as
they
passed
it
,
and
her
reading
having
made
her
well
acquainted
with
the
noble
dramas
produced
at
that
unpretending
establishment
—
little
better
than
a
barn
in
comparison
with
a
modern
playhouse,—she
regarded
it
with
deep
interest
.
<EOS>
Another
theatre
—
the
Swan
—
speedily
claimed
her
attention
;
and
,
leaving
it
behind
,
they
came
upon
the
open
country
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
growing
rapidly
dark
,
and
<EOS>
Catesby
,
turning
off
into
a
narrow
lane
on
the
right
,
shouted
to
his
companions
to
keep
near
him
.
<EOS>
The
tract
of
land
they
were
traversing
was
flat
and
marshy
.
<EOS>
The
air
was
damp
and
unwholesome
—
for
the
swamp
had
not
been
drained
as
in
later
times,—and
the
misty
exhalations
arising
from
it
added
to
the
obscurity
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
however
,
did
not
relax
his
pace
,
and
his
companions
imitated
his
example
.
<EOS>
Another
turn
on
the
right
seemed
to
bring
them
still
nearer
the
river
,
and
involved
them
in
a
thicker
fog
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
Catesby
stopped
,
and
cried,"We
should
be
near
the
house
.
<EOS>
And
yet
this
fog
perplexes
me
.
<EOS>
Stay
here
while
I
search
for
it
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
leave
us
<EOS>
,
we
shall
not
readily
meet
again
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
But
the
caution
was
unheeded
,
Catesby
having
already
disappeared
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
afterwards
,
Fawkes
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
's
hoofs
approaching
him
;
and
,
thinking
it
was
Catesby
,
he
hailed
the
rider
.
<EOS>
The
horseman
made
no
answer
,
but
continued
to
advance
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Just
then
the
voice
of
Catesby
was
heard
at
a
little
distance
,
shouting
,
"
I
was
right
.
<EOS>
It
is
here
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
party
then
hastened
in
the
direction
of
the
cry
,
and
perceived
through
the
gloom
a
low
building
,
before
the
door
of
which
Catesby
,
who
had
dismounted
,
was
standing
.
<EOS>
"A
stranger
is
amongst
us
,
"
observed
Fawkes
,
in
an
under
tone
,
as
he
rode
up
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
demanded
Catesby
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"Here
,
"
replied
a
voice
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
friend
.
<EOS>
""I
must
have
stronger
assurance
than
that
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you?""Robert
Keyes
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
my
voice?""In
good
truth
<EOS>
I
did
not
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
;
"
and
you
have
spoken
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
Your
arrival
is
most
opportune
.
<EOS>
But
what
brings
you
here
to
-
night?""The
<EOS>
same
errand
as
yourself
<EOS>
,
I
conclude
,
Catesby
,
"
replied
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"
I
came
here
to
see
that
all
was
in
safety
.
<EOS>
But
,
who
have
you
with
you?""Let
us
<EOS>
enter
the
house
,
and
you
shall
learn
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
With
this
,
he
tapped
thrice
at
the
door
in
a
peculiar
manner
,
and
presently
a
light
was
seen
through
the
windows
,
and
a
voice
from
within
demanded
who
knocked
.
<EOS>
"Your
master
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
door
was
instantly
unbarred
.
<EOS>
After
a
hasty
greeting
between
Catesby
and
his
servant
,
whom
he
addressed
as
Thomas
Bates
,
the
former
inquired
whether
aught
had
occurred
during
his
absence
,
and
was
answered
that
,
except
an
occasional
visit
from
Mr.
Percy
,
one
of
the
conspirators
,
no
one
had
been
near
the
house
;
everything
being
in
precisely
the
same
state
he
had
left
it
.
<EOS>
"That
is
well
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Now
,
then
,
to
dispose
of
the
horses
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
the
party
having
dismounted
,
their
steeds
were
led
to
a
stable
at
the
back
of
the
premises
by
Catesby
and
Bates
,
while
the
others
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
,
mean
-
looking
habitation
,
standing
at
a
short
distance
from
the
river
-
side
,
on
the
skirts
of
Lambeth
Marsh
,
and
its
secluded
situation
and
miserable
appearance
seldom
induced
any
one
to
visit
it
.
<EOS>
On
one
side
was
a
deep
muddy
sluice
communicating
with
the
river
.
<EOS>
Within
,
it
possessed
but
slight
accommodation
,
and
only
numbered
four
apartments
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
best
of
these
was
assigned
to
Viviana
,
and
she
retired
to
it
as
soon
as
it
could
be
prepared
for
her
reception
.
<EOS>
Garnet
,
who
still
carried
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
but
who
was
in
other
respects
almost
recovered
from
his
accident
,
tendered
every
assistance
in
his
power
,
and
would
have
remained
with
her
,
but
she
entreated
to
be
left
alone
.
<EOS>
On
descending
to
the
lower
room
,
he
found
Catesby
,
who
,
having
left
Bates
in
care
of
the
horses
,
produced
such
refreshments
as
they
had
brought
with
them
.
<EOS>
These
were
scanty
enough
;
but
a
few
flasks
of
excellent
wine
which
they
found
within
the
house
made
some
amends
for
the
meagre
repast
.
<EOS>
Viviana
was
solicited
by
Guy
Fawkes
to
join
them
;
but
she
declined
,
alleging
that
she
was
greatly
fatigued
,
and
about
to
retire
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Their
meal
ended
,
Catesby
proposed
that
they
should
ascertain
the
condition
of
the
powder
,
as
he
feared
it
might
have
suffered
from
being
so
long
in
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Before
making
this
examination
,
the
door
was
carefully
barred
;
the
shutters
of
the
windows
closed
;
and
Guy
Fawkes
placed
himself
as
sentinel
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
A
flag
beneath
the
grate
,
in
which
a
fire
was
never
kindled
,
was
then
raised
,
and
disclosed
a
flight
of
steps
leading
to
a
vault
beneath
.
<EOS>
Catesby
having
placed
a
light
in
a
lantern
,
descended
with
Keyes
;
but
both
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
refused
to
accompany
them
.
<EOS>
The
vault
was
arched
and
lofty
,
and
,
strange
to
say
,
for
its
situation
,
dry
—
a
circumstance
owing
,
in
all
probability
,
to
the
great
thickness
of
the
walls
.
<EOS>
On
either
side
were
ranged
twenty
barrels
filled
with
powder
;
and
at
the
further
end
stood
a
pile
of
arms
,
consisting
of
pikes
,
rapiers
,
demi
-
lances
,
petronels
,
calivers
,
corslets
,
and
morions
.
<EOS>
Removing
one
of
the
barrels
from
its
station
,
Catesby
forced
open
the
lid
,
and
examined
its
contents
,
which
he
found
perfectly
dry
and
uninjured
.
<EOS>
"It
is
fit
for
use
,
"
he
observed
,
with
a
significant
smile
,
as
he
exhibited
a
handful
of
the
powder
to
Keyes
,
who
stood
at
a
little
distance
with
the
lantern
;
"
if
it
will
keep
as
well
in
the
cellar
beneath
the
Parliament
House
,
our
foes
will
soon
be
nearer
heaven
,
than
they
would
ever
be
if
left
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
do
you
propose
to
transport
it
across
the
river
?
"
asked
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"To
-
night
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
dark
and
foggy
,
and
fitting
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Bates
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
;
and
at
the
call
his
servant
instantly
descended
.
"
<EOS>
Is
the
wherry
at
her
moorings?""She
is
,
your
worship
,
"
replied
Bates
.
<EOS>
"You
must
cross
the
river
instantly
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
and
proceed
to
the
dwelling
adjoining
the
Parliament
House
,
which
we
hired
from
Ferris
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
key
.
<EOS>
Examine
the
premises,—and
<EOS>
bring
word
whether
all
is
secure
.
<EOS>
"Bates
was
about
to
depart
,
when
Keyes
volunteering
to
accompany
him
,
they
left
the
house
together
.
<EOS>
Having
fastened
down
the
lid
of
the
cask
,
Catesby
summoned
Fawkes
to
his
assistance
,
and
by
his
help
as
many
barrels
as
could
be
safely
stowed
in
the
boat
were
brought
out
of
the
vault
.
<EOS>
More
than
two
hours
elapsed
before
Bates
returned
.
<EOS>
He
was
alone
,
and
informed
them
that
all
was
secure
,
but
that
Keyes
had
decided
on
remaining
where
he
was,—it
being
so
dark
and
foggy
,
that
it
was
scarcely
possible
to
cross
the
river
.
<EOS>
"I
had
some
difficulty
in
landing
,
"
he
added
,
"
and
got
considerably
out
of
my
course
.
<EOS>
I
never
was
out
on
so
dark
a
night
before
.
<EOS>
""It
is
the
better
for
us
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
sure
to
escape
observation
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
this
opinion
Guy
Fawkes
concurred
,
and
they
proceeded
to
transport
the
powder
to
the
boat
,
which
was
brought
up
the
sluice
within
a
few
yards
of
the
door
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
and
the
barrels
covered
with
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
,
they
embarked
,
and
Fawkes
,
seizing
an
oar
,
propelled
the
skiff
along
the
narrow
creek
.
<EOS>
As
Bates
had
stated
,
the
fog
was
so
dense
that
it
was
wholly
impossible
to
steer
correctly
,
and
Fawkes
was
therefore
obliged
to
trust
to
chance
as
to
the
course
he
took
.
<EOS>
However
,
having
fully
regained
his
strength
,
he
rowed
with
great
swiftness
,
and
,
as
far
as
he
could
judge
,
had
gained
the
mid
-
stream
,
when
,
before
he
could
avoid
it
,
he
came
in
violent
contact
with
another
boat
,
oversetting
it
,
and
plunging
its
occupants
in
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Disregarding
the
hints
and
even
menaces
of
Catesby
,
who
urged
him
to
proceed
,
Fawkes
immediately
lay
upon
his
oars
,
and
,
as
the
water
was
perfectly
smooth
,
succeeded
,
without
much
difficulty
,
in
extricating
the
two
men
from
their
perilous
situation
.
<EOS>
Their
boat
having
drifted
down
the
stream
,
could
not
be
recovered
.
<EOS>
The
chief
of
these
personages
was
profuse
in
his
thanks
to
his
deliverers
,
whom
he
supposed
were
watermen
,
and
they
took
care
not
to
undeceive
him
.
<EOS>
"You
may
rely
upon
my
gratitude
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
when
I
tell
you
I
am
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
you
will
be
satisfied
I
have
the
means
of
evincing
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Earl
of
Salisbury
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
who
was
seated
by
Fawkes
,
having
taken
one
of
the
oars
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
possible?""I
have
been
on
secret
state
business
,
"
replied
the
Earl
,
"
and
did
not
choose
to
employ
my
own
barge
.
<EOS>
I
was
returning
to
Whitehall
,
when
your
boat
struck
against
mine
.
<EOS>
""It
is
our
bitterest
enemy
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
in
an
under
tone
,
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Fate
has
delivered
him
into
our
hands
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
are
you
about
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Fawkes
,
observing
that
his
companion
no
longer
pulled
at
the
oar
.
<EOS>
"Shoot
<EOS>
him
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Keep
still
,
while
I
disengage
my
petronel
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
not
be
,
"
returned
Fawkes
,
laying
a
firm
grasp
upon
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
perish
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
""If
we
suffer
him
to
escape
now
,
we
may
never
have
such
a
chance
again
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
shoot
him
.
<EOS>
""I
say
you
shall
not
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
hour
is
not
yet
come
.
<EOS>
""What
are
you
talking
about
,
my
masters
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
Earl
,
who
was
shivering
in
his
wet
garments
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
throw
him
overboard
,
"
he
whispered
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
I
say
,
you
shall
not
,
"
replied
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"I
see
what
you
are
afraid
of
,
"
cried
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
smugglers
.
<EOS>
You
have
got
some
casks
of
distilled
waters
on
board
,
and
are
afraid
I
may
report
you
.
<EOS>
Fear
nothing
.
<EOS>
Land
me
near
the
palace
,
and
count
upon
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
""Our
course
lies
in
a
different
direction
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
If
your
lordship
lands
at
all
,
it
must
be
where
we
choose
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
have
to
see
the
King
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
some
important
papers
to
deliver
to
him
respecting
the
Papists
,
"
replied
Salisbury
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
,
at
least
,
have
those
papers
,
"
he
observed
,
in
a
whisper
,
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"That
is
a
different
affair
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
They
may
prove
serviceable
to
us
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
lord
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
"
by
a
strange
chance
you
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
Catholics
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
pleased
to
deliver
these
papers
to
us
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
villains
,
would
you
rob
me
?
"
cried
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
take
my
life
sooner
.
<EOS>
""We
will
take
both
,
if
you
resist
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
in
a
menacing
tone
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
then
,
"
returned
Salisbury
,
attempting
to
draw
his
sword
,
"
we
will
see
who
will
obtain
the
mastery
.
<EOS>
We
are
equally
matched
.
<EOS>
Come
on
;
I
fear
you
not
.
"But
<EOS>
the
waterman
who
had
rowed
the
Earl
was
not
of
equal
courage
with
his
employer
,
and
refused
to
take
part
in
the
conflict
.
<EOS>
"It
will
be
useless
to
contend
with
us
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
relinquishing
the
oar
to
Fawkes
,
and
springing
forward
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
those
papers
,
"
he
added
,
seizing
the
Earl
by
the
throat
,
"
or
I
will
throw
you
overboard
.
<EOS>
""I
am
mistaken
in
you
,
"
returned
Salisbury
;
"
you
are
no
common
mariner
.
<EOS>
""It
matters
not
who
or
what
I
am
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
fiercely
.
"
<EOS>
Your
papers
,
or
you
die
.
<EOS>
"Finding
<EOS>
it
in
vain
to
contend
with
his
opponent
,
the
Earl
was
fain
to
yield
,
and
reluctantly
produced
a
packet
from
his
doublet
,
and
delivered
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
"You
will
repent
this
outrage
,
villain
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Your
lordship
will
do
well
to
recollect
you
are
still
in
my
power
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
One
thrust
of
my
sword
will
wipe
off
some
of
the
injuries
you
have
inflicted
on
our
suffering
party
.
<EOS>
""I
have
heard
your
voice
before
,
"
cried
Salisbury
;
"
you
shall
not
escape
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
imprudence
has
destroyed
you
,
"
retorted
Catesby
,
clutching
the
Earl
's
throat
more
tightly
,
and
shortening
his
sword
,
with
the
intent
to
plunge
it
into
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
grasping
his
arm
,
and
preventing
the
blow
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
said
you
shall
not
slay
him
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
possession
of
his
papers
.
<EOS>
What
more
would
you
have?""His
life
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
struggling
to
liberate
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
swear
not
to
betray
us
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
refuses
,
I
will
not
stay
your
hand
.
<EOS>
""You
hear
what
my
companion
says
,
my
lord
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
swear
to
keep
silence
as
to
what
has
just
occurred?"After
a
moment
's
hesitation
,
Salisbury
assented
,
and
Catesby
relinquished
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
During
this
time
,
the
boat
had
drifted
considerably
down
the
stream
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
darkness
,
Catesby
noticed
with
some
uneasiness
that
they
were
approaching
more
than
one
vessel
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Salisbury
also
perceived
this
,
and
raised
a
cry
for
help
,
but
was
instantly
checked
by
Catesby
,
who
took
a
seat
beside
him
,
and
placing
the
point
of
his
rapier
at
his
breast
,
swore
he
would
stab
him
if
he
made
any
further
clamour
.
<EOS>
The
threat
,
and
the
dangerous
propinquity
of
his
enemy
,
effectually
silenced
the
Earl
,
and
Catesby
directed
Fawkes
to
make
for
the
shore
as
quickly
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
His
injunctions
were
obeyed
,
and
Fawkes
plied
the
oars
with
so
much
good
-
will
,
that
in
a
few
minutes
the
wherry
struck
against
the
steps
,
which
projected
far
into
the
water
,
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
Star
Chamber
,
precisely
on
the
spot
where
Westminster
Bridge
now
stands
.
<EOS>
Here
the
Earl
and
his
companion
were
allowed
to
disembark
,
and
they
had
no
sooner
set
foot
on
land
than
Guy
Fawkes
pushed
off
the
boat
,
and
rowed
as
swiftly
as
he
could
towards
the
centre
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
He
then
demanded
of
Catesby
whether
he
should
make
for
the
Parliament
House
,
or
return
.
<EOS>
"I
scarcely
know
what
to
advise
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
think
the
Earl
will
attempt
pursuit
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
know
not
.
<EOS>
The
papers
we
have
obtained
may
be
important
.
<EOS>
Cease
rowing
for
a
moment
,
and
let
us
listen
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
complied
,
and
they
listened
intently
,
but
could
only
hear
the
rippling
of
the
current
against
the
sides
of
the
skiff
.
<EOS>
"We
have
nothing
to
fear
,
"
observed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
He
will
not
pursue
us
,
or
he
can
not
find
a
boat
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
glimmer
of
torches
was
visible
on
the
shore
,
and
the
plunge
of
oars
into
the
water
convinced
him
his
opinion
was
erroneous
.
<EOS>
"What
course
shall
we
take
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"I
care
not
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
had
had
my
own
way
,
this
would
not
have
happened
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
no
fears
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
rowing
swiftly
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
easily
escape
.
<EOS>
""We
will
not
be
taken
alive
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
seating
himself
on
one
of
the
barrels
,
and
hammering
against
the
lid
with
the
butt
-
end
of
his
petronel
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
sooner
blow
us
all
to
perdition
than
he
shall
capture
us
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
By
my
patron
,
Saint
James
,
he
is
taking
the
same
course
as
ourselves
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
let
him
board
us
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
ready
for
him
.
<EOS>
""Do
as
you
think
proper
if
the
worst
occurs
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
we
make
no
noise
,
I
am
assured
we
shall
not
be
perceived
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
he
ceased
rowing
,
and
suffered
the
boat
to
drop
down
the
stream
.
<EOS>
As
ill
-
luck
would
have
it
,
it
seemed
as
if
the
hostile
bark
had
struck
completely
into
their
track
,
and
,
aided
by
the
current
,
and
four
sturdy
rowers
,
was
swiftly
approaching
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Earl
will
be
upon
us
in
a
few
minutes
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
have
any
prayers
to
offer
,
recite
them
quickly
,
for
I
swear
I
will
be
as
good
as
my
word
.
<EOS>
""I
am
ever
prepared
for
death
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
we
are
<EOS>
saved!"This
last
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
his
remarking
a
large
barge
,
towards
which
they
were
rapidly
drifting
.
<EOS>
"What
are
you
about
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Catesby.—"Leap
on
board
,
and
abandon
the
skiff
,
together
with
its
contents?""No
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
sit
still
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
this
time
,
they
had
approached
the
barge
,
which
was
lying
at
anchor
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
,
grasping
at
a
boat
-
hook
,
fixed
it
in
the
vessel
as
they
passed
,
and
drew
their
own
boat
close
to
its
side
—
so
close
,
in
fact
,
that
it
could
not
be
distinguished
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
the
chase
came
up
,
and
they
distinctly
perceived
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
seated
in
the
stern
of
the
boat
,
holding
a
torch
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
barge
,
he
held
the
light
towards
it
;
but
the
skiff
being
on
the
off
-
side
,
entirely
escaped
notice
.
<EOS>
When
the
chase
had
got
to
a
sufficient
distance
to
be
out
of
hearing
,
the
fugitives
rowed
swiftly
in
the
contrary
direction
.
<EOS>
Not
judging
it
prudent
to
land
,
they
continued
to
ply
the
oars
,
until
fatigue
compelled
them
to
desist
,
and
they
had
placed
some
miles
between
them
and
their
pursuers
.
<EOS>
"Long
before
this
,
the
Earl
must
have
given
up
the
chase
,
"
observed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
return
before
daybreak
,
and
either
land
our
powder
near
the
Parliament
House
,
or
take
it
back
to
the
vault
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
shall
run
equal
risk
either
way
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
and
,
having
ventured
thus
far
,
we
may
as
well
go
through
with
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
for
landing
at
Westminster
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
giving
up
a
project
when
I
have
once
undertaken
it
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
speak
my
sentiments
exactly
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Westminster
be
it
.
"After
<EOS>
remaining
stationary
for
about
an
hour
,
they
rowed
back
again
,
and
,
aided
by
the
stream
,
in
a
short
time
reached
their
destination
.
<EOS>
The
fog
had
in
a
great
degree
cleared
off
,
and
day
began
to
break
as
they
approached
the
stairs
leading
to
the
Parliament
House
.
<EOS>
Though
this
was
not
what
they
desired
,
inasmuch
as
the
light
added
to
the
risk
they
would
have
run
in
landing
the
powder
,
it
enabled
them
to
ascertain
that
no
one
was
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
Running
swiftly
in
towards
a
sort
of
wharf
,
protected
by
a
roofed
building
,
Catesby
leapt
ashore
,
and
tied
the
skiff
to
a
ring
in
the
steps
.
<EOS>
He
then
desired
Fawkes
to
hand
out
the
powder
as
quickly
as
he
could
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
several
barrels
were
on
the
strand
.
<EOS>
"Had
<EOS>
you
not
better
fetch
Keyes
to
help
us
,
while
I
get
out
the
rest
?
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Catesby
assented
,
and
hurrying
to
the
house
,
found
Keyes
,
who
was
in
great
alarm
about
them
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
accompanied
the
other
to
the
wharf
,
and
by
their
united
efforts
the
powder
was
expeditiously
and
safely
removed
.

<EOS>
—
<EOS>
THE
TRAITORThe
habitation
,
to
which
the
powder
was
conveyed
,
adjoined
,
as
has
already
been
stated
,
the
Parliament
House
,
and
stood
at
the
south
-
west
corner
of
that
structure
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
building
,
two
stories
high
,
with
a
little
garden
attached
to
it
,
surrounded
by
lofty
walls
,
and
belonged
to
Whinneard
,
the
keeper
of
the
royal
wardrobe
,
by
whom
it
was
let
to
a
person
named
Ferris
.
<EOS>
From
the
latter
it
was
hired
by
Thomas
Percy
,
one
of
the
conspirators
,
and
a
relative
of
the
Earl
of
Northumberland,—of
whom
it
will
be
necessary
to
speak
more
fully
hereafter,—for
the
purpose
to
which
it
was
now
put
.
<EOS>
Having
bestowed
the
barrels
of
powder
carefully
in
the
cellar
,
and
fastened
the
door
of
the
house
and
the
garden
-
gate
after
them
,
the
trio
returned
to
the
boat
,
and
rowed
back
to
Lambeth
,
where
they
arrived
without
being
noticed
.
<EOS>
They
then
threw
themselves
upon
the
floor
,
and
sought
some
repose
after
their
fatigue
.
<EOS>
It
was
late
in
the
day
before
they
awoke
.
<EOS>
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
had
been
long
astir
;
but
Viviana
had
not
quitted
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
Catesby
's
first
object
was
to
examine
the
packet
he
had
obtained
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
and
withdrawing
to
a
corner
,
he
read
over
the
papers
one
by
one
carefully
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
watched
his
countenance
as
he
perused
them
,
but
he
asked
no
questions
.
<EOS>
Many
of
the
documents
appeared
to
have
little
interest
,
for
Catesby
tossed
them
aside
with
an
exclamation
of
disappointment
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
a
small
note
dropped
from
the
bundle
.
<EOS>
Catesby
picked
it
up
,
opened
it
,
and
his
whole
expression
changed
.
<EOS>
His
brow
grew
contracted
;
and
,
springing
to
his
feet
,
he
uttered
an
ejaculation
of
rage
,
crying
,
"
It
is
as
I
suspected
.
<EOS>
We
have
traitors
among
us
.
<EOS>
""Whom
<EOS>
do
you
suspect
?
"
cried
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Tresham
!
"
cried
Catesby
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder,—"the
fawning
,
wily
,
lying
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
to
league
him
with
us
.
<EOS>
""He
is
your
own
kinsman
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"He
is
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
were
he
my
own
brother
he
should
die
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
letter
from
him
to
Lord
Mounteagle
,
which
has
found
its
way
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
hinting
that
a
plot
is
hatching
against
the
state
,
and
offering
to
give
him
full
information
of
it
.
<EOS>
""Traitor
!
<EOS>
false
,
perjured
traitor
!
"
cried
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
He
must
die
.
<EOS>
""He
shall
fall
by
my
hand
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stay
!
<EOS>
a
plan
occurs
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
can
not
be
aware
that
this
letter
is
in
my
possession
.
<EOS>
I
will
send
Bates
to
bid
him
come
hither
.
<EOS>
We
will
then
charge
him
with
his
criminality
,
and
put
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
""He
deserves
severe
punishment
,
no
doubt
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
but
I
am
unwilling
you
should
proceed
to
the
last
extremities
with
him
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
alternative
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Our
safety
demands
his
destruction
.
<EOS>
"Garnet
<EOS>
returned
no
answer
,
but
bowed
his
head
sorrowfully
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
Bates
was
then
despatched
to
Tresham
;
and
preparations
were
made
by
the
three
lay
conspirators
for
executing
their
fell
design
.
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
,
that
on
his
arrival
,
Tresham
should
be
seized
and
disarmed
,
and
after
being
interrogated
by
Catesby
touching
the
extent
of
his
treachery
,
should
be
stabbed
by
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
This
being
resolved
upon
,
it
became
a
question
how
they
should
act
in
the
interim
.
<EOS>
It
was
possible
that
,
after
the
loss
of
his
papers
,
some
communication
might
take
place
between
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
Lord
Mounteagle
,
and
through
the
latter
with
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Thus
prepared
,
on
the
arrival
of
Bates
,
Tresham
,
seeing
through
their
design
,
instead
of
accompanying
him
,
might
give
information
of
their
retreat
to
the
officers
.
<EOS>
The
contingency
was
by
no
means
improbable
;
and
it
was
urged
so
strongly
by
Garnet
,
that
Catesby
began
to
regret
his
precipitancy
in
sending
the
message
.
<EOS>
Still
,
his
choler
was
so
greatly
roused
against
Tresham
,
that
he
resolved
to
gratify
his
vengeance
at
any
risk
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
betrays
us
,
and
brings
the
officers
here
,
we
shall
know
how
to
act
,
"
he
remarked
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
that
below
which
will
avenge
us
on
them
all
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
trust
we
shall
not
be
obliged
to
resort
to
it
.
<EOS>
"Soon
<EOS>
after
this
,
Bates
returned
with
a
message
from
Tresham
,
stating
that
he
would
be
at
the
rendezvous
at
nightfall
,
and
that
he
had
important
disclosures
to
make
to
them
.
<EOS>
He
desired
them
,
moreover
,
to
observe
the
utmost
caution
,
and
not
to
stir
abroad
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
may
,
perhaps
,
be
able
to
offer
an
explanation
of
his
conduct
,
"
observed
Keyes
.
"Impossible
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
shall
not
die
without
a
hearing
.
<EOS>
""That
is
all
I
desire
,
"
returned
Keyes
.
<EOS>
While
the
others
were
debating
upon
the
interrogations
they
should
put
to
Tresham
,
and
further
examining
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
papers
,
Garnet
repaired
to
Viviana
's
chamber
,
and
informed
her
what
was
about
to
take
place
.
<EOS>
She
was
filled
with
consternation
,
and
entreated
to
be
allowed
to
see
Guy
Fawkes
for
a
few
moments
alone
.
<EOS>
Moved
by
her
supplications
,
Garnet
complied
,
and
presently
afterwards
Fawkes
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"You
have
sent
for
me
,
Viviana
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
What
would
you?""I
have
just
heard
you
are
about
to
put
one
of
your
companions
to
death
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
<EOS>
Radcliffe
,
"
returned
Fawkes
,
"
by
your
own
desire
you
have
mixed
yourself
up
with
my
fortunes
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
now
discuss
the
prudence
of
the
step
you
have
taken
.
<EOS>
But
I
deem
it
necessary
to
tell
you
,
once
for
all
,
that
any
attempts
to
turn
me
from
the
line
of
conduct
I
have
marked
out
to
myself
will
fail
.
<EOS>
Tresham
has
betrayed
us
,
and
he
must
pay
the
penalty
of
his
treason
.
<EOS>
""But
not
with
his
life
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
not
now
perceive
into
what
enormities
this
fatal
enterprise
will
lead
you
?
<EOS>
It
is
not
one
crime
alone
that
you
are
about
to
commit
,
but
many
.
<EOS>
You
constitute
yourselves
judges
of
your
companion
,
and
without
allowing
him
to
defend
himself
,
take
his
life
.
<EOS>
Disguise
it
as
you
may
,
it
is
assassination
—
cold
-
blooded
assassination
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
life
is
justly
forfeited
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
When
he
took
the
oath
of
secrecy
and
fidelity
to
our
league
,
he
well
knew
what
the
consequences
would
be
if
he
violated
it
.
<EOS>
He
has
done
so
.
<EOS>
He
has
compromised
our
safety
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
has
sold
us
to
our
enemies
,
and
nothing
shall
save
him
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
this
is
so
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
how
much
better
would
it
be
to
employ
the
time
now
left
in
providing
for
your
safety
,
than
in
contriving
means
of
vengeance
upon
one
,
who
will
be
sufficiently
punished
for
his
baseness
by
his
own
conscience
.
<EOS>
Even
if
you
destroy
him
,
you
will
not
add
to
your
own
security
,
while
you
will
commit
a
foul
and
needless
crime
,
equal
,
if
not
exceeding
in
atrocity
that
you
seek
to
punish
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
in
an
angry
tone
,
"
in
an
evil
hour
,
I
consented
to
your
accompanying
me
.
<EOS>
I
now
repent
my
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
But
,
having
passed
my
word
,
I
can
not
retract
.
<EOS>
You
waste
time
,
and
exhaust
my
patience
and
your
own
by
these
unavailing
supplications
.
<EOS>
When
I
embarked
in
this
enterprise
,
I
embraced
all
its
dangers
,
all
its
crimes
if
you
will
,
and
I
shall
not
shrink
from
them
.
<EOS>
The
extent
of
Tresham
's
treachery
is
not
yet
known
to
us
.
<EOS>
There
may
be
—
and
God
grant
it!—extenuating
circumstances
in
his
conduct
that
may
save
his
life
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
case
stands
at
present
,
his
offence
appears
of
that
dye
that
nothing
can
wash
it
out
but
his
blood
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"When
<EOS>
do
you
expect
this
wretched
man
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Viviana
,
arresting
him
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
nightfall
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
that
there
were
any
means
of
warning
him
of
his
danger
!
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
are
none
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
fiercely,—"none
that
you
can
adopt
.
<EOS>
And
I
must
lay
my
injunctions
upon
you
not
to
quit
your
chamber
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
retired
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Viviana
became
a
prey
to
the
most
agonizing
reflections
.
<EOS>
Despite
the
strong
,
and
almost
unaccountable
interest
she
felt
in
Guy
Fawkes
,
she
began
to
repent
the
step
she
had
taken
in
joining
him
,
as
calculated
to
make
her
a
party
to
his
criminal
conduct
.
<EOS>
But
this
feeling
was
transient
,
and
was
succeeded
by
a
firmer
determination
to
pursue
the
good
work
she
had
undertaken
.
"Though
<EOS>
slight
success
has
hitherto
attended
my
efforts
,
"
she
thought
,
"
that
is
no
reason
why
I
should
relax
them
.
<EOS>
The
time
is
arrived
when
I
may
exert
a
beneficial
influence
over
him
;
and
it
may
be
,
that
what
occurs
to
-
night
will
prove
the
first
step
towards
complete
triumph
.
<EOS>
In
any
case
,
nothing
shall
be
wanting
to
prevent
the
commission
of
the
meditated
atrocity
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
she
knelt
down
and
prayed
long
and
fervently
,
and
arose
confirmed
and
strengthened
in
her
resolution
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
no
alteration
had
taken
place
in
the
purposes
of
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
Night
came
,
but
with
it
came
not
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
who
,
up
to
this
time
had
managed
to
restrain
his
impatience
,
now
arose
,
and
signified
his
intention
of
going
in
search
of
him
,
and
was
with
difficulty
prevented
from
carrying
his
threat
into
execution
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
represented
the
folly
and
risk
of
such
a
course
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
comes
not
before
midnight
,
we
shall
know
what
to
think
,
and
how
to
act
,
"
he
observed
;
"
but
till
then
let
us
remain
tranquil
.
<EOS>
"Keyes
<EOS>
and
the
others
adding
their
persuasions
to
those
of
Fawkes
,
Catesby
sat
sullenly
down
,
and
a
profound
silence
ensued
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
some
hours
were
passed
,
when
just
at
the
stroke
of
midnight
,
Viviana
descended
from
her
room
,
and
appeared
amongst
them
.
<EOS>
Her
countenance
was
deathly
pale
,
and
she
looked
anxiously
around
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
All
,
however
,
with
the
exception
of
Fawkes
,
avoided
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
he
come
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
listened
intently
,
but
have
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
have
murdered
him
.
<EOS>
And
yet
your
looks
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
Father
Garnet
,
answer
me,—is
the
deed
done?""No
,
my
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"Then
he
has
escaped
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
joyfully
.
<EOS>
"
You
expected
him
at
nightfall
.
<EOS>
""It
is
not
yet
too
late
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
in
a
sombre
tone
;
"
his
death
is
only
deferred
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
say
so
,
"
she
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
.
<EOS>
"
I
hoped
you
had
relented
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
a
peculiar
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
was
thrice
repeated
,
and
the
strokes
vibrated
,
though
with
different
effect
,
through
every
bosom
.
<EOS>
"He
is
here
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
,
go
to
your
chamber
,
"
commanded
Guy
Fawkes
,
grasping
her
hand
,
and
leading
her
towards
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
But
she
resisted
his
efforts
,
and
fell
on
her
knees
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
go
,
"
she
cried
,
in
a
supplicating
tone
,
"
unless
you
will
spare
this
man
's
life
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
told
you
my
fixed
determination
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
not
retire
of
your
own
free
will
,
I
must
force
you
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
attempt
it
,
I
will
scream
,
and
alarm
your
victim
,
"
she
replied
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
she
added
,
"
have
my
prayers
,
my
entreaties
,
no
weight
with
you
?
<EOS>
Will
you
not
grant
me
his
life?""No
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Catesby
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
She
must
be
silenced
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
significant
look
at
Fawkes
.
"She
<EOS>
shall
,
"
replied
the
latter
,
drawing
his
poniard
.
<EOS>
"
Viviana
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
in
a
voice
,
and
with
a
look
that
left
no
doubt
as
to
his
intentions
,
"
do
not
compel
me
to
be
your
destroyer
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
knocking
was
repeated
,
and
Viviana
uttered
a
prolonged
and
piercing
cry
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
raised
his
weapon
,
and
was
about
to
strike
,
but
his
resolution
failed
him
,
and
his
arm
dropped
nerveless
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
"Your
better
angel
has
conquered
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
,
clasping
his
knees
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
Catesby
,
and
Tresham
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
outcry
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
looking
round
in
alarm
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
do
I
see
?
<EOS>
Viviana
Radcliffe
here
!
<EOS>
Did
she
utter
the
scream?""She
did
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
rising
,
"
and
she
hoped
to
warn
you
by
it
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
led
on
by
your
fate
.
<EOS>
""Warn
me
from
what
?
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Tresham
,
starting
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
among
friends
.
<EOS>
""You
are
among
those
who
have
resolved
upon
your
death
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
"
exclaimed
Tresham
,
making
an
effort
to
gain
the
door
,
and
draw
his
sword
.
<EOS>
In
both
attempts
,
however
,
he
was
foiled
,
for
Catesby
intercepted
him
,
while
Fawkes
and
Keyes
flung
themselves
upon
him
,
and
binding
his
arms
together
with
a
sword
-
belt
,
forced
him
into
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"Of
<EOS>
what
am
I
accused
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
,
in
a
voice
tremulous
with
rage
and
terror
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
learn
presently
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
And
he
motioned
to
Fawkes
to
remove
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
remain
,
"
she
cried
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
My
nature
is
changed
,
and
is
become
as
savage
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
If
blood
must
be
spilt
,
I
will
tarry
to
look
upon
it
.
<EOS>
""This
is
no
place
for
you
,
dear
daughter
,
"
interposed
Garnet
.
"Nor
<EOS>
for
you
either
,
father
,
"
retorted
Viviana
,
bitterly
;
"
unless
you
will
act
as
a
minister
of
Christ
,
and
prevent
this
violence
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
her
remain
,
if
she
will
,
"
observed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Her
presence
need
not
hinder
our
proceedings
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
seated
himself
opposite
Tresham
,
while
the
two
priests
placed
themselves
on
either
side
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
took
up
a
position
on
the
left
of
the
prisoner
,
with
his
drawn
dagger
in
his
hand
,
and
Keyes
stationed
himself
near
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
captive
regarded
them
with
terrified
glances
,
and
trembled
in
every
limb
.
<EOS>
"Thomas
<EOS>
Tresham
,
"
commenced
Catesby
,
in
a
stern
voice
,
"
you
are
a
sworn
brother
in
our
plot
.
<EOS>
Before
I
proceed
further
,
I
will
ask
you
what
should
be
his
punishment
who
violates
his
oath
,
and
betrays
his
confederates
?
<EOS>
We
await
your
answer?"But
Tresham
remained
obstinately
silent
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
,
since
you
refuse
to
speak
,
"
continued
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
death
—
death
by
the
hands
of
his
associates
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
,
"
replied
Tresham
;
"
but
I
have
neither
broken
my
oath
,
nor
betrayed
you
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
letter
to
Lord
Mounteagle
is
in
my
possession
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Behold
it!""Perdition
!
"
exclaimed
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
not
slay
me
?
<EOS>
I
have
betrayed
nothing
.
<EOS>
I
have
revealed
nothing
.
<EOS>
On
my
soul
's
salvation
,
I
have
not
!
<EOS>
Spare
me
!
<EOS>
spare
me
!
<EOS>
and
I
will
be
a
faithful
friend
in
future
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
indiscreet
—
I
own
it
—
but
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
have
mentioned
no
names
.
<EOS>
And
Lord
Mounteagle
,
as
you
well
know
,
is
as
zealous
a
Catholic
as
any
now
present
.
<EOS>
""Your
letter
has
been
sent
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
"
pursued
Catesby
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
from
him
I
obtained
it
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
Lord
Mounteagle
has
betrayed
me
,
"
returned
Tresham
,
becoming
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
"Have
you
nothing
further
to
allege
?
"
demanded
Catesby
.
<EOS>
As
Tresham
made
no
answer
,
he
turned
to
the
others
,
and
said
,
"
Is
it
your
judgment
he
should
die?"All
,
except
Viviana
,
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Tresham
,
"
continued
Catesby
,
solemnly
,
"
prepare
to
meet
your
fate
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
,
father
,
"
he
added
to
Garnet
,
"
proceed
to
shrive
him
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
"
cried
Viviana
,
stepping
into
the
midst
of
them,—"hold
!
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
,
in
a
voice
so
authoritative
,
and
with
a
look
so
commanding
,
that
the
whole
assemblage
were
awe
-
stricken
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
think
to
commit
this
crime
with
impunity
,
you
are
mistaken
.
<EOS>
I
swear
by
everything
sacred
,
if
you
take
this
man
's
life
,
I
will
go
forth
instantly
,
and
denounce
you
all
to
the
Council
.
<EOS>
You
may
stare
,
sirs
,
and
threaten
me
,
but
you
shall
find
I
will
keep
my
word
.
<EOS>
""We
must
put
her
to
death
too
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
in
an
under
tone
to
Fawkes
,
"
or
we
shall
have
a
worse
enemy
left
than
Tresham
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
consent
to
it
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"If
you
mistrust
this
person
,
why
not
place
him
in
restraint
?
"
pursued
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
mend
matters
by
killing
him
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
says
<EOS>
well
,
"
observed
Garnet
;
"
let
us
put
him
in
some
place
of
security
.
<EOS>
""I
am
agreed
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
judgment
,
then
,
is
overruled
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
not
oppose
you
.
<EOS>
We
will
imprison
him
in
the
vault
beneath
this
chamber
.
<EOS>
""He
must
be
without
light
,
"
said
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
arms
,
"
added
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
without
food
,
"
muttered
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
only
exchanged
one
death
for
another
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
flag
was
then
raised
,
and
Tresham
thrust
into
the
vault
,
after
which
it
was
restored
to
its
former
position
.
<EOS>
"I
have
saved
you
from
the
lesser
crime
,
"
cried
Viviana
to
Guy
Fawkes
;
"
and
,
with
Heaven
's
grace
<EOS>
,
I
trust
to
preserve
you
from
the
greater!"III

THE
ESCAPE
PREVENTEDViviana
having
retired
to
her
chamber
,
apparently
to
rest
,
a
long
and
anxious
consultation
was
held
by
the
conspirators
as
to
the
next
steps
to
be
pursued
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
of
opinion
that
,
as
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
was
aware
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
state
being
on
foot
among
the
Catholics
,
their
project
ought
to
be
deferred
,
if
not
altogether
abandoned
.
<EOS>
"We
are
sure
to
be
discovered
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Arrests
without
end
will
take
place
.
<EOS>
And
such
rigorous
measures
will
be
adopted
by
the
Earl
,
such
inquiries
instituted
,
that
all
will
infallibly
be
brought
to
light
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
we
know
not
what
Tresham
may
have
revealed
.
<EOS>
He
denies
having
betrayed
our
secret
,
but
no
credit
can
be
attached
to
his
assertions
.
<EOS>
""Shall
<EOS>
we
examine
him
again
,
father
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
"
and
wring
the
truth
from
him
by
threats
or
torture?""No
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
let
him
remain
where
he
is
till
morning
.
<EOS>
A
night
of
solitary
confinement
,
added
to
the
stings
of
his
own
guilty
conscience
,
is
likely
to
produce
a
stronger
effect
upon
him
than
any
torments
we
could
inflict
.
<EOS>
He
shall
be
interrogated
strictly
to
-
morrow
,
and
,
I
will
answer
for
it
,
will
make
a
full
confession
.
<EOS>
But
even
if
he
has
revealed
nothing
material
,
there
exists
another
and
equally
serious
ground
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
I
allude
to
your
meeting
with
the
Earl
on
the
river
.
<EOS>
I
should
be
the
last
to
counsel
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
But
if
ever
it
could
be
justified
,
it
might
have
been
so
in
this
case
.
<EOS>
""I
would
have
slain
him
if
I
had
had
my
own
way
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
with
a
fierce
and
reproachful
look
at
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"If
I
have
done
wrong
,
I
will
speedily
repair
my
error
,
"
observed
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
desire
his
death
,
father
?
<EOS>
and
will
you
absolve
me
from
the
deed
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turning
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"It
is
better
as
it
is
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
making
a
gesture
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
our
high
and
holy
purpose
stained
by
common
slaughter
.
<EOS>
The
power
that
delivered
him
into
your
hands
,
and
stayed
them
,
no
doubt
preserved
him
for
the
general
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
My
first
fear
was
lest
,
having
noticed
the
barrels
of
powder
within
the
boat
,
he
might
have
suspected
your
design
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
satisfied
his
eyes
were
blinded
,
and
his
reason
benighted
,
so
that
he
could
discern
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
was
my
own
opinion
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
observe
the
utmost
caution
,
but
proceed
at
all
hazards
with
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
If
we
delay
,
we
fail
.
<EOS>
""Right
,
"
returned
Catesby
;
"
and
for
that
counsel
I
forgive
you
for
standing
between
me
and
our
enemy
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
this
,
it
was
agreed
that
if
nothing
occurred
in
the
interim
,
more
powder
should
be
transported
to
the
habitation
in
Westminster
on
the
following
night,—that
Fawkes
and
Catesby
,
who
might
be
recognised
by
Salisbury
's
description
,
should
keep
close
house
during
the
day,—and
that
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
should
be
summoned
to
assist
in
digging
the
mine
.
<EOS>
Prayers
were
then
offered
up
by
the
two
priests
for
their
preservation
from
peril
,
and
for
success
in
their
enterprise
;
after
which
,
they
threw
themselves
on
benches
or
seats
,
and
courted
slumber
.
<EOS>
All
slept
soundly
except
Fawkes
,
who
,
not
being
able
to
close
his
eyes
,
from
an
undefinable
apprehension
of
danger
,
arose
,
and
cautiously
opening
the
door
,
kept
watch
outside
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Viviana
,
who
had
waited
till
all
was
quiet
,
softly
descended
the
stairs
,
and
,
shading
her
light
,
gazed
timorously
round
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
<EOS>
she
was
not
observed
,
she
glided
swiftly
and
noiselessly
to
the
fire
-
place
,
and
endeavoured
to
raise
the
flag
.
<EOS>
But
it
resisted
all
her
efforts
,
and
she
was
about
to
abandon
the
attempt
in
despair
,
when
she
perceived
a
bolt
on
one
side
,
that
had
escaped
her
notice
.
<EOS>
Hastily
withdrawing
it
,
she
experienced
no
further
difficulty
.
<EOS>
The
stone
revolved
on
hinges
like
a
trap
-
door
,
and
lifting
it
,
she
hurried
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
her
approach
,
Tresham
had
retreated
to
the
further
end
of
the
vault
,
and
snatching
up
a
halbert
from
the
pile
of
weapons
,
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
desperation—"Stand
off
!
<EOS>
I
am
armed
,
and
have
severed
my
bonds
.
<EOS>
Off
,
I
say
!
<EOS>
You
shall
not
take
me
with
life
.
<EOS>
""Hush
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Viviana
,
putting
her
finger
to
her
lips
,
"
I
am
come
to
set
you
free
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
I
behold
an
inhabitant
of
this
world
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Tresham
,
crossing
himself
,
and
dropping
the
halbert
,
"
or
some
blessed
saint
?
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
she
advanced
towards
him
,
"
it
is
Viviana
Radcliffe
—
my
preserver
.
<EOS>
Pardon
,
sweet
lady
.
<EOS>
My
eyes
were
dazzled
by
the
light
,
and
your
sudden
appearance
and
speech,—and
<EOS>
I
might
almost
say
<EOS>
looks,—made
<EOS>
me
think
you
were
some
supernatural
being
come
to
deliver
me
from
these
bloody
-
minded
men
.
<EOS>
Where
are
they?""In
<EOS>
the
room
above
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
whisper,—"asleep,—and
if
you
speak
so
loud
you
will
arouse
them
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
us
fly
without
a
moment
's
delay
,
"
returned
Tresham
,
in
the
same
tone
,
and
hastily
picking
up
a
rapier
and
a
dagger
.
<EOS>
"Stay
!
"
cried
Viviana
,
arresting
him
.
<EOS>
"
Before
you
go
,
you
must
tell
me
what
you
are
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
""We
will
talk
of
that
when
we
are
out
of
this
accursed
place
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
not
stir
a
footstep
,
"
she
rejoined
,
placing
herself
resolutely
between
him
and
the
outlet
,
"
till
you
have
sworn
neither
to
betray
your
confederates
,
nor
to
do
them
injury
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
Heaven
requite
me
,
if
I
forgive
them
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tresham
between
his
ground
teeth
.
<EOS>
"Remember!—you
are
yet
in
their
power
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
One
word
from
me
,
and
they
are
at
your
side
.
<EOS>
Swear!—and
swear
solemnly
,
or
you
do
not
quit
this
spot
.
<EOS>
"Tresham
<EOS>
gazed
at
her
fiercely
,
and
griped
his
dagger
,
as
if
determined
to
free
himself
at
any
cost
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
"
she
ejaculated
,
noticing
the
movement
,
"
you
are
indeed
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
You
have
neither
sense
of
honour
nor
gratitude
,
and
I
leave
you
to
your
fate
.
<EOS>
Attempt
to
follow
me
,
and
I
give
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
""Forgive
<EOS>
me
,
Viviana
,
"
he
cried
,
abjectly
prostrating
himself
at
her
feet
,
and
clinging
to
the
hem
of
her
dress
.
<EOS>
"
I
meant
only
to
terrify
you
;
I
would
not
injure
you
for
worlds
.
<EOS>
Do
not
leave
me
with
these
ruthless
cut
-
throats
.
<EOS>
They
will
assuredly
murder
me
.
<EOS>
Do
not
remain
with
them
yourself
,
or
you
will
come
to
some
dreadful
end
.
<EOS>
Fly
with
me
,
and
I
will
place
you
beyond
their
reach
—
will
watch
over
your
safety
.
<EOS>
Or
,
if
you
are
resolved
to
brave
their
fury
,
let
me
go
,
and
I
will
take
any
oath
you
propose
.
<EOS>
As
I
hope
for
salvation
I
will
not
betray
them
.
<EOS>
""Peace
!
"
cried
Viviana
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
set
you
free
,
it
is
not
to
save
you
,
but
them
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
?
"
asked
Tresham
,
hesitating
.
"Question
<EOS>
me
not
,
but
follow
<EOS>
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
and
tread
softly
,
as
you
value
your
life
.
<EOS>
"Tresham
needed
no
caution
on
this
head
,
and
as
they
emerged
from
the
trap
-
door
in
breathless
silence
,
and
he
beheld
the
figures
of
his
sleeping
foes
,
he
could
scarcely
muster
sufficient
courage
to
pass
through
them
.
<EOS>
Motioning
him
to
proceed
quickly
,
Viviana
moved
towards
the
door
,
and
to
her
surprise
found
it
unfastened
.
<EOS>
Without
pausing
to
consider
whence
this
neglect
could
arise
,
she
opened
it
,
and
Tresham
,
who
trembled
in
every
limb
,
and
walked
upon
the
points
of
his
feet
,
stepped
forth
.
<EOS>
As
he
crossed
the
threshold
,
however
,
a
powerful
grasp
was
laid
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
a
drawn
sword
presented
to
his
breast
,
while
the
voice
of
Fawkes
thundered
in
his
ear
,
"
Who
goes
there
?
<EOS>
Speak
,
or
I
strike
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
the
fugitive
,
not
daring
to
answer
,
lest
his
accents
should
betray
him
,
endeavoured
vainly
to
break
away
,
Viviana
,
hearing
the
struggle
,
threw
open
the
door
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
It
is
Tresham
.
<EOS>
I
set
him
free
.
""You
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Fawkes
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Wherefore?""In
the
hope
that
his
escape
would
induce
you
to
abandon
your
design
,
and
seek
safety
in
flight
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
have
thwarted
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
"Fawkes
<EOS>
made
no
reply
,
but
thrust
Tresham
forcibly
into
the
house
,
and
called
to
Catesby
,
who
by
this
time
had
been
roused
with
the
others
,
to
close
and
bar
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
command
was
instantly
obeyed
,
and
as
Catesby
turned
,
a
strange
and
fearful
group
met
his
view
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
stood
Tresham
,
his
haggard
features
and
palsied
frame
bespeaking
the
extremity
of
his
terror
.
<EOS>
His
sword
having
been
beaten
from
his
grasp
by
Fawkes
,
and
his
dagger
wrested
from
him
by
Keyes
,
he
was
utterly
defenceless
.
<EOS>
Viviana
had
placed
herself
between
him
and
his
assailants
,
and
screening
him
from
their
attack
,
cried—"Despatch
me
.
<EOS>
The
fault
is
mine
—
mine
only
—
and
I
am
ready
to
pay
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
Had
I
not
released
him
,
he
would
not
have
attempted
to
escape
.
<EOS>
I
am
the
rightful
victim
.
<EOS>
""She
speaks
the
truth
,
"
gasped
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
had
not
offered
to
liberate
me
,
I
should
never
have
thought
of
flying
.
<EOS>
Would
to
Heaven
<EOS>
I
had
never
yielded
to
her
solicitations!""Peace
,
craven
hound
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
furiously
;
"
you
deserve
to
die
for
your
meanness
and
ingratitude
,
if
not
for
your
treachery
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
for
this
miserable
wretch
,
Viviana
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
her
,
"
that
you
would
have
placed
your
friends
in
such
fearful
jeopardy,—it
<EOS>
is
for
him
,
who
would
sacrifice
you
without
scruple
to
save
himself
,
that
you
now
offer
your
own
life?""I
deserve
your
reproaches
,
"
she
rejoined
,
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
"Had
<EOS>
I
not
fortunately
intercepted
him
,
"
pursued
Fawkes
,
"
an
hour
would
not
have
elapsed
ere
<EOS>
he
would
have
returned
with
the
officers
;
and
we
should
have
changed
this
dwelling
for
a
dungeon
in
the
Tower,—these
benches
for
the
rack
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
pity
stab
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
falling
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
oh
!
do
not
wound
me
with
your
words
.
<EOS>
I
have
committed
a
grievous
wrong
;
but
I
was
ignorant
of
the
consequences
;
and
,
as
I
hope
for
mercy
hereafter
,
my
sole
motive
,
beyond
compassion
for
this
wretched
man
,
was
to
terrify
you
into
relinquishing
your
dreadful
project
.
<EOS>
""You
have
acted
wrongfully,—very
wrongfully
,
Viviana
,
"
interposed
Garnet
:
"
but
since
you
are
fully
convinced
of
your
error
,
no
more
need
be
said
.
<EOS>
There
are
seasons
when
the
heart
must
be
closed
against
compassion
,
and
when
mercy
becomes
injustice
.
<EOS>
Go
to
your
chamber
,
and
leave
us
to
deal
with
this
unhappy
man
.
<EOS>
""To
-
morrow
you
must
quit
us
,
"
observed
Fawkes
,
as
she
passed
him
.
<EOS>
"Quit
you
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
offend
again
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
trust
you
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
unless
—
but
it
is
useless
to
impose
restrictions
upon
you
,
which
you
will
not
—
perhaps
,
can
not
observe
.
<EOS>
""Impose
<EOS>
any
restrictions
you
please
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
not
bid
me
leave
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
time
is
come
when
we
must
separate
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
See
you
not
that
the
course
we
are
taking
is
slippery
with
blood
,
and
beset
with
perils
which
the
firmest
of
your
sex
could
not
encounter?""I
will
encounter
them
nevertheless
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Be
merciful
,
"
she
added
,
pointing
to
Tresham
,
"
and
mercy
shall
be
shown
you
in
your
hour
of
need
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
slowly
withdrew
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Catesby
addressed
a
few
words
aside
to
Keyes
and
Oldcorne
,
and
now
stepping
forward
,
and
fixing
his
eye
steadily
upon
the
prisoner
,
to
note
the
effect
of
his
speech
upon
him
,
said—"I
have
devised
a
plan
by
which
the
full
extent
of
Tresham
's
treachery
can
be
ascertained
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
mean
to
torture
him
,
I
trust
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Garnet
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"No
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
torture
is
inflicted
at
all
,
it
will
be
upon
the
mind
,
not
the
body
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
will
be
no
torture
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
State
your
plan
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
""It
is
this
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
He
shall
write
a
letter
to
Lord
Mounteagle
,
stating
that
he
has
important
revelations
to
make
to
him
,
and
entreating
him
to
come
hither
unattended
.
""Here
!
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Here
,
"
repeated
Catesby
;
"
and
alone
.
<EOS>
We
will
conceal
ourselves
in
such
manner
that
we
may
overhear
what
passes
between
them
,
and
if
any
attempt
is
made
by
the
villain
to
betray
our
presence
,
he
shall
be
immediately
shot
.
<EOS>
By
this
means
we
can
not
fail
to
elicit
the
truth
.
<EOS>
""I
approve
your
plan
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
but
who
will
convey
the
letter
to
Lord
Mounteagle?""I
will
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Let
it
be
prepared
at
once
,
and
the
case
will
be
thought
the
more
urgent
.
<EOS>
I
will
watch
him
,
and
see
that
he
comes
unattended
,
or
give
you
timely
warning
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
Let
writing
materials
be
procured
,
and
I
will
dictate
the

"Tresham
,
meanwhile
,
exhibited
no
misgiving
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
his
countenance
brightened
up
as
the
plan
was
approved
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
life
will
be
spared
<EOS>
if
you
find
I
have
not
deceived
you
,
will
it
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
,
in
a
supplicating
voice
.
"Assuredly
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
me
pen
and
ink
<EOS>
,
then
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
I
will
write
whatever
you
desire
.
<EOS>
""Our
<EOS>
secret
is
safe
,
"
whispered
Catesby
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
useless
to
test
him
further
.
<EOS>
""I
think
so
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
Would
we
had
made
this
experiment
sooner!""Do
<EOS>
not
delay
,
I
entreat
you
,
"
implored
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
eager
to
prove
my
innocence
.
<EOS>
""We
are
satisfied
with
the
proof
we
have
already
obtained
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
Tresham
dropped
on
his
knees
in
speechless
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"We
are
spared
the
necessity
of
being
your
executioners
,
my
son
,
"
pursued
Garnet
,
"
and
I
rejoice
at
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
acquit
you
of
the
design
to
betray
us
;
and
till
you
have
unburthened
your
whole
soul
to
me
,
and
proved
by
severe
and
self
-
inflicted
penance
that
you
are
really
penitent
,
you
must
remain
a
captive
within
these
walls
.
<EOS>
""I
will
disguise
nothing
from
you
,
father
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
"
and
will
strive
to
expiate
my
offence
by
the
severest
penance
you
choose
to
inflict
.
<EOS>
""Do
this
,
my
son
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
;
"
leave
no
doubt
of
your
sincerity
,
and
you
may
be
yet
restored
to
the
place
you
have
forfeited
,
and
become
a
sharer
in
our
great
enterprise
.
<EOS>
""I
will
never
trust
him
more
,
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
:
"
<EOS>
not
that
I
have
more
faith
in
him
than
either
of
you
;
but
I
will
so
watch
him
that
he
shall
not
dare
to
betray
us
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
more
,
"
he
added
,
in
an
under
tone
,
to
Garnet
,
"
I
will
turn
his
treachery
to
account
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
a
useful
spy
upon
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
he
can
be
relied
on
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
this
,
you
need
have
no
fears
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
with
a
significant
smile
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
first
part
of
your
penance
,
my
son
,
"
said
Garnet
,
addressing
Tresham
,
"
shall
be
to
pass
the
night
in
solitary
vigil
and
prayer
within
the
vault
.
<EOS>
Number
your
transgressions
,
and
reflect
upon
their
enormity
.
<EOS>
Consider
not
only
the
injury
your
conduct
might
have
done
us
,
but
the
holy
church
of
which
you
are
so
sinful
a
member
.
<EOS>
Weigh
over
all
this
,
and
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
will
hear
your
confession
;
when
,
if
I
find
you
in
a
state
of
grace
,
absolution
shall
not
be
refused
.
<EOS>
"Tresham
humbly
bowed
his
head
in
token
of
acquiescence
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
led
to
the
vault
,
and
the
flag
closed
over
him
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
after
a
brief
conversation
,
the
others
again
stretched
themselves
on
the
floor
,
and
sought
repose
.

IV
.
—
<EOS>
THE
MINESome
days
elapsed
before
the
conspirators
ventured
forth
from
their
present
abode
.
<EOS>
They
had
intended
to
remove
the
rest
of
the
powder
without
loss
of
time
,
but
were
induced
to
defer
their
purpose
on
the
representations
of
Tresham
,
who
stated
to
Garnet
,
that
in
his
opinion
they
would
run
a
great
and
needless
risk
.
<EOS>
Before
the
expiration
of
a
week
,
Tresham
's
apparent
remorse
for
his
perfidy
,
added
to
his
seeming
zeal
,
had
so
far
reinstated
him
in
the
confidence
of
his
associates
,
that
he
was
fully
absolved
of
his
offence
by
Garnet
;
and
,
after
taking
fresh
oaths
of
even
greater
solemnity
than
the
former
,
was
again
admitted
to
the
league
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
however
,
who
placed
little
faith
in
his
protestations
,
never
lost
sight
of
him
for
an
instant
,
and
,
even
if
he
meditated
an
escape
,
he
had
no
opportunity
of
effecting
it
.
<EOS>
A
coldness
,
stronger
on
his
side
than
hers
,
seemed
to
have
arisen
between
Viviana
and
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Whenever
she
descended
to
the
lower
room
,
he
withdrew
on
some
excuse
;
and
though
he
never
urged
her
departure
by
words
,
his
looks
plainly
bespoke
that
he
desired
it
.
<EOS>
Upon
one
occasion
,
she
found
him
alone,—the
others
being
at
the
time
within
the
vault
.
<EOS>
He
was
whetting
the
point
of
his
dagger
,
and
did
not
hear
her
approach
,
until
she
stood
beside
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
slightly
confused
,
and
a
deep
ruddy
stain
flushed
his
swarthy
cheeks
and
brow
;
but
he
averted
his
gaze
,
and
continued
his
occupation
in
silence
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
do
you
shun
me
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Viviana
,
laying
her
hand
gently
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
he
did
not
answer
,
she
repeated
the
question
in
a
broken
voice
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
then
looked
up
,
and
perceived
that
her
eyes
were
filled
with
tears
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shun
you
,
Viviana
,
for
two
reasons
,
"
he
replied
gravely
,
but
kindly
;
"
first
,
because
I
would
have
no
ties
of
sympathy
to
make
me
cling
to
the
world
,
or
care
for
it
;
and
I
feel
that
if
I
suffer
myself
to
be
interested
about
you
,
this
will
not
long
be
the
case
:
secondly
,
and
chiefly
,
because
you
are
constantly
striving
to
turn
me
from
my
fixed
purpose
;
and
,
though
your
efforts
have
been
,
and
will
be
unavailing
,
yet
I
would
not
be
exposed
to
them
further
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
fear
me
,
because
you
think
I
shall
shake
your
resolution
,
"
she
rejoined
,
with
a
forced
smile
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
trouble
you
no
more
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
if
you
wish
it
,
I
will
go
.
<EOS>
""It
were
better
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
in
accents
of
deep
emotion
,
and
taking
her
hand
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Painful
as
will
be
the
parting
with
you
,
I
shall
feel
more
easy
when
it
is
over
.
<EOS>
It
grieves
me
to
the
soul
to
see
you
—
the
daughter
of
the
proud
,
the
wealthy
Sir
William
Radcliffe
—
an
inmate
of
this
wretched
abode
,
surrounded
by
desperate
men
,
whose
actions
you
disapprove
,
and
whose
danger
you
are
compelled
to
share
.
<EOS>
Think
how
it
would
add
to
my
suffering
if
our
plot
—
which
Heaven
avert
—
should
be
discovered
,
and
you
be
involved
in
it
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
think
of
it
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
banish
it
from
my
thoughts
,
"
continued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
reconcile
it
to
my
feelings
that
one
so
young
,
so
beautiful
,
should
be
thus
treated
.
<EOS>
Dwelling
on
this
idea
unmans
me
—
unfits
me
for
sterner
duties
.
<EOS>
The
great
crisis
is
at
hand
,
and
I
must
live
only
for
it
.
<EOS>
""Live
<EOS>
for
it
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
;
"
but
,
<EOS>
oh
!
let
me
remain
with
you
till
the
blow
is
struck
.
<EOS>
Something
tells
me
I
may
yet
be
useful
to
you
—
may
save
you
.
<EOS>
""No
more
of
this
,
if
you
would
indeed
remain
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Regard
me
as
a
sword
in
the
hand
of
fate
,
which
can
not
be
turned
aside,—as
a
bolt
launched
from
the
cloud
,
and
shattering
all
in
its
course
,
which
may
not
be
stopped,—as
something
terrible
,
exterminating
,
immovable
.
<EOS>
Regard
me
as
this
,
and
say
whether
I
am
not
to
be
shunned
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
I
am
as
steadfast
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
will
remain
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
gazed
at
her
in
surprise
mixed
with
admiration
,
and
pressing
her
hand
affectionately
,
said,"I
applaud
your
resolution
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
a
daughter
,
I
should
wish
her
to
be
like
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
promised
to
be
a
father
to
me
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
How
can
you
be
so
if
I
leave
you?""How
<EOS>
can
I
be
so
if
you
stay
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Fawkes
,
mournfully
.
"
<EOS>
No
,
you
must
indulge
no
filial
tenderness
for
one
so
utterly
unable
to
requite
it
as
myself
.
<EOS>
Fix
your
thoughts
wholly
on
Heaven
.
<EOS>
Pray
for
the
restoration
of
our
holy
religion
—
for
the
success
of
the
great
enterprise
—
and
haply
your
prayers
may
prevail
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
pray
for
that
,
"
she
replied
;
"
for
I
do
not
wish
it
success
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
pray
—
and
fervently
—
that
all
danger
may
be
averted
from
your
head
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
,
Catesby
and
Keyes
emerged
from
the
vault
,
and
Viviana
hurried
to
her
chamber
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
grew
dark
,
the
remaining
barrels
of
powder
were
brought
out
of
the
cellar
,
and
carefully
placed
in
the
boat
.
<EOS>
Straw
was
then
heaped
upon
them
,
and
the
whole
covered
with
a
piece
of
tarpaulin
,
as
upon
the
former
occasion
.
<EOS>
It
being
necessary
to
cross
the
river
more
than
once
,
the
conduct
of
the
first
and
most
hazardous
passage
was
intrusted
to
Fawkes
,
and
accompanied
by
Keyes
and
Bates
,
both
of
whom
were
well
armed
,
he
set
out
a
little
before
midnight
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
clear
starlight
night
;
but
as
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
,
they
were
under
no
apprehension
of
discovery
.
<EOS>
The
few
craft
they
encountered
,
bent
probably
on
some
suspicious
errand
like
themselves
,
paid
no
attention
to
them
;
and
plying
their
oars
swiftly
<EOS>
,
they
shot
under
the
low
parapet
edging
the
gardens
of
the
Parliament
House
,
just
as
the
deep
bell
of
the
Abbey
tolled
forth
the
hour
of
twelve
.
<EOS>
Keeping
in
the
shade
,
they
silently
approached
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
No
one
was
there
,
not
even
a
waterman
to
attend
to
the
numerous
wherries
moored
to
the
steps
;
and
,
without
losing
a
moment
,
they
sprang
ashore
,
and
concealing
the
barrels
beneath
their
cloaks
,
glided
like
phantoms
summoned
by
the
witching
hour
along
the
passage
formed
by
two
high
walls
,
leading
to
Old
Palace
Yard
,
and
speedily
reached
the
gate
of
the
habitation
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
and
with
the
utmost
rapidity
,
the
whole
of
the
fearful
cargo
was
safely
deposited
in
the
garden
;
and
leaving
the
others
to
carry
it
into
the
house
,
Guy
Fawkes
returned
to
the
boat
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
push
off
,
two
persons
rushed
to
the
stair
-
head
,
and
the
foremost
,
evidently
mistaking
him
for
a
waterman
,
called
to
him
to
take
them
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
"I
am
no
waterman
,
friend
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
and
am
engaged
on
business
of
my
own
.
<EOS>
Seek
a
wherry
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
""By
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
new
-
comer
,
in
accents
of
surprise
,
"
it
is
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
know
me?""Can
<EOS>
it
be
Humphrey
Chetham
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Fawkes
,
equally
astonished
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
This
meeting
is
most
fortunate
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
search
of
you
,
having
somewhat
of
importance
to
communicate
to
Viviana
.
<EOS>
""State
it
quickly
,
then
,
"
returned
Fawkes
;
"
I
can
not
tarry
here
much
longer
.
<EOS>
""I
will
go
with
you
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
springing
into
the
boat
,
and
followed
by
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
me
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Impossible
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Fawkes
,
rising
angrily
;
"
neither
can
I
permit
you
to
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
busied
about
my
own
concerns
,
and
will
not
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
""At
least
,
tell
me
where
I
can
find
Viviana
,
"
persisted
Chetham
.
"Not
<EOS>
now
—
not
now
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
Meet
me
to
-
morrow
night
,
at
this
hour
,
in
the
Great
Sanctuary
,
at
the
farther
side
of
the
Abbey
,
and
you
shall
learn
all
you
desire
to
know
.
<EOS>
""Why
not
now
?
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
earnestly
.
<EOS>
"
You
need
not
fear
me
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
spy
,
and
will
reveal
nothing
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
your
companion
?
"
hesitated
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"It
is
only
Martin
Heydocke
,
"
answered
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
He
can
keep
a
close
tongue
as
well
as
his
master
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
sit
down
,
then
,
"
returned
Fawkes
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
There
will
be
less
risk
in
taking
them
to
Lambeth
,
"
he
muttered
,
"
than
in
loitering
here
.
"
<EOS>
And
rowing
with
great
swiftness
,
he
soon
gained
the
centre
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
,
"
he
observed
,
resting
for
a
moment
on
his
oars
,
"
you
still
cherish
your
attachment
to
Viviana
,
I
see
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
never
start
,
man
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
enemy
to
your
suit
,
though
others
may
be
.
<EOS>
And
if
she
would
place
herself
at
my
disposal
,
I
would
give
her
to
you,—certain
that
it
would
be
to
one
upon
whom
her
affections
are
fixed
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
think
any
change
likely
to
take
place
in
her
sentiments
towards
me
?
"
<EOS>
faltered
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
May
I
indulge
a
hope?""I
would
not
have
you
despair
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Because
,
as
far
as
I
have
noticed
,
women
are
not
apt
to
adhere
to
their
resolutions
in
matters
of
the
heart
;
and
because
,
as
I
have
just
said
,
she
loves
you
,
and
I
see
no
reasonable
bar
to
your
union
.
<EOS>
""You
give
me
new
life
,
"
cried
Chetham
,
transported
with
joy
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
that
you
,
who
have
so
much
influence
with
her
,
would
speak
in
my
behalf
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
you
must
plead
your
own
cause
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
hold
out
much
hope
at
present
;
for
recent
events
have
cast
a
deep
gloom
over
her
spirit
,
and
she
appears
to
be
a
prey
to
melancholy
.
<EOS>
Let
this
wear
<EOS>
off,—and
<EOS>
with
one
<EOS>
so
young
and
so
firm
-
minded
it
is
sure
to
do
so,—and
then
your
suit
may
be
renewed
.
<EOS>
Urge
it
when
you
may
,
you
have
my
best
wishes
for
success
,
and
shall
have
my
warmest
efforts
to
second
you
.
"Humphrey
<EOS>
Chetham
murmured
his
thanks
in
accents
almost
unintelligible
from
emotion
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
continued,"It
would
be
dangerous
for
you
to
disembark
with
me
;
but
when
I
put
you
ashore
,
I
will
point
out
the
dwelling
at
present
occupied
by
Viviana
.
<EOS>
You
can
visit
it
as
early
as
you
please
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
will
find
no
one
with
her
but
Father
Oldcorne
,
and
I
need
scarcely
add
,
it
will
gladden
me
to
the
heart
to
find
on
my
return
that
she
has
yielded
to
your
entreaties
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
thank
you
,
"
cried
Chetham
,
warmly
grasping
his
hand
;
"
but
I
hope
to
find
some
means
of
evincing
my
gratitude
.
<EOS>
""Prove
it
by
maintaining
the
strictest
secresy
as
to
all
you
may
see
or
hear,—or
even
suspect,—within
<EOS>
the
dwelling
you
are
about
to
visit
,
"
returned
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Knowing
that
I
am
dealing
with
a
man
of
honour
,
I
require
no
stronger
obligation
than
your
word
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
it
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
worship
shall
have
my
oath
,
if
you
desire
it
,
"
remarked
Martin
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
;
"
your
master
will
answer
for
your
fidelity
.
<EOS>
"Shortly
<EOS>
after
this
,
Guy
Fawkes
pulled
ashore
,
and
his
companions
landed
.
<EOS>
After
pointing
out
the
solitary
habitation
,
which
possessed
greater
interest
in
Humphrey
Chetham
's
eyes
than
the
proud
structures
he
had
just
quitted
,
and
extracting
a
promise
that
the
young
merchant
would
not
approach
it
till
the
morrow
,
he
rowed
off
,
and
while
the
others
proceeded
to
Lambeth
in
search
of
lodging
for
the
night
,
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
little
creek
,
and
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
found
the
other
conspirators
anxiously
awaiting
his
arrival
,
and
the
certainty
afforded
by
his
presence
that
the
powder
had
been
landed
in
safety
gave
general
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Preparations
were
immediately
made
for
another
voyage
.
<EOS>
A
large
supply
of
provisions
,
consisting
of
baked
meat
of
various
kinds
,
hard
-
boiled
eggs
,
pasties
,
bread
,
and
other
viands
,
calculated
to
serve
for
a
week
's
consumption
,
without
the
necessity
of
having
recourse
to
any
culinary
process
,
and
which
had
been
previously
procured
with
that
view
,
together
with
a
few
flasks
of
wine
,
occupied
the
place
in
the
boat
lately
assigned
to
the
powder
.
<EOS>
At
the
risk
of
overloading
the
vessel
,
they
likewise
increased
its
burthen
by
a
quantity
of
mining
implements
—
spades
,
pickaxes
,
augers
,
and
wrenching
irons
.
<EOS>
To
these
were
added
as
many
swords
,
calivers
,
pikes
,
and
petronels
,
as
the
space
left
would
accommodate
.
<EOS>
Garnet
and
Catesby
<EOS>
then
embarked,—the
former
having
taken
an
affectionate
farewell
of
Viviana
,
whom
he
committed
,
with
the
strictest
injunction
to
watch
over
her
,
to
the
care
of
Father
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
lingered
for
a
moment
,
doubting
whether
he
should
mention
his
rencounter
with
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
more
undecided
from
the
deep
affliction
in
which
she
was
plunged
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
determined
upon
slightly
hinting
at
the
subject
,
and
to
be
guided
as
to
what
he
said
further
by
the
manner
in
which
the
allusion
was
received
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
decide
upon
remaining
here
till
we
return
,
Viviana
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
She
made
a
sign
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
will
see
no
one?""No
one
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"But
,
should
any
old
friend
find
his
way
hither
—
Humphrey
Chetham
,
for
instance
—
will
you
not
receive
him?""Why
<EOS>
do
you
single
out
him
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Viviana
,
inquiringly
.
<EOS>
"
Is
he
in
London
?
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
him?""I
have
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
;
"
I
accidentally
met
him
to
-
night
,
and
have
shown
him
this
dwelling
.
<EOS>
He
will
come
hither
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""I
wanted
only
this
to
make
me
thoroughly
wretched
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
clasping
her
hands
with
anguish
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
what
unhappy
chance
threw
him
across
your
path
?
<EOS>
Why
did
you
tell
him
I
was
here
?
<EOS>
Why
give
him
a
hope
that
I
would
see
him
?
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
see
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
quit
this
house
rather
than
be
exposed
to
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
""What
means
this
sudden
excitement
,
Viviana
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Guy
Fawkes
,
greatly
surprised
by
her
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
a
visit
from
Humphrey
Chetham
occasion
you
uneasiness?""I
know
not
,
"
she
answered
,
blushing
deeply
;
"
but
I
will
not
hazard
it
.
<EOS>
""I
thought
you
superior
to
your
sex
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
"
and
should
never
have
suspected
you
of
waywardness
or
caprice
.
<EOS>
""You
charge
me
with
failings
that
do
not
belong
to
me
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
neither
wayward
nor
capricious
;
but
I
would
be
willingly
spared
the
pain
of
an
interview
with
one
whom
I
thought
I
loved
.
<EOS>
""Thought
you
loved
!
"
echoed
Fawkes
,
in
increased
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
thought
,
"
repeated
Viviana
,
"
for
I
have
since
examined
my
heart
,
and
find
he
has
no
place
in
it
.
<EOS>
""You
might
be
happy
with
him
,
Viviana
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"I
might
have
been
,
"
she
replied
,
"
had
circumstances
favoured
our
union
.
<EOS>
But
I
should
not
be
so
now
.
<EOS>
Recent
events
have
wrought
an
entire
change
in
my
feelings
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
abandon
my
resolution
of
retiring
to
a
cloister,—were
<EOS>
I
to
return
to
the
world,—and
<EOS>
were
such
an
event
possible
as
that
Humphrey
Chetham
should
conform
to
the
faith
of
Rome,—still
,
I
would
not
—
could
not
we
d
him
.
<EOS>
""I
grieve
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
you
have
me
we
d
him
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
,
in
a
slightly
mortified
tone
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
good
sooth
would
I
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
and
I
repeat
my
firm
conviction
you
would
be
happier
with
him
than
with
one
more
highly
born
,
and
of
less
real
worth
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
made
no
reply
,
and
her
head
declined
upon
her
bosom
.
<EOS>
"You
will
see
him
,
"
pursued
Fawkes
,
taking
her
hand
,
"
if
only
to
tell
him
what
you
have
just
told
me
.
<EOS>
""Since
<EOS>
you
desire
it
<EOS>
,
I
will
,
"
she
replied
,
fixing
a
look
of
melancholy
tenderness
upon
him
;
"
but
it
will
cost
me
a
bitter
pang
.
<EOS>
""I
would
not
tax
you
with
it
,
if
I
did
not
think
it
needful
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
farewell
.
<EOS>
""Farewell,—it
may
be
,
for
ever
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
boat
is
ready
,
and
the
tide
ebbing
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
impatiently
,
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
aground
if
you
tarry
longer
.
<EOS>
""I
come
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
And
,
waving
an
adieu
to
Viviana
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
"Strange
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
muttered
to
himself
,
as
he
took
his
way
to
the
creek
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
sworn
she
was
in
love
with
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
Who
can
have
superseded
him
in
her
regard
?
<EOS>
Not
Catesby
,
of
a
surety
.
'
<EOS>
Tis
a
perplexing
sex
.
<EOS>
The
best
are
fickle
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praised
!
<EOS>
I
have
long
been
proof
against
their
wiles
.
<EOS>
"Thus
musing
,
he
sprang
into
the
skiff
,
and
assisting
Catesby
to
push
it
into
deep
water
,
seized
an
oar
,
and
exerted
himself
stoutly
to
make
up
for
lost
time
.
<EOS>
The
second
voyage
was
as
prosperous
as
the
first
.
<EOS>
A
thick
veil
of
cloud
had
curtained
the
stars
;
the
steps
were
deserted
as
before
;
and
the
provisions
,
arms
,
and
implements
were
securely
conveyed
to
their
destination
.
<EOS>
Thus
far
fortune
seemed
to
favour
their
undertaking
,
and
Garnet
,
falling
on
his
knees
,
offered
up
the
most
fervent
thanksgivings
.
<EOS>
Prayers
over
,
they
descended
to
the
cellar
,
and
their
first
care
was
to
seek
out
a
place
as
free
from
damp
as
possible
,
where
the
powder
could
be
deposited
till
the
excavation
,
which
it
was
foreseen
<EOS>
would
be
a
work
of
time
and
great
labour
,
was
completed
.
<EOS>
A
dry
corner
being
found
,
the
barrels
were
placed
in
it
,
and
carefully
concealed
with
billets
of
wood
and
coals
,
so
as
to
avert
suspicion
in
case
of
search
.
<EOS>
This
,
with
other
arrangements
,
occupied
the
greater
part
of
the
night
,
and
the
commencement
of
the
important
undertaking
was
deferred
till
the
morrow
,
when
an
increase
of
their
party
was
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
whole
of
the
day
no
one
stirred
forth
.
<EOS>
The
windows
were
kept
closed
;
the
doors
locked
;
and
,
as
no
fires
were
lighted
,
the
house
had
the
appearance
of
being
uninhabited
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
morning
they
underwent
considerable
alarm
.
<EOS>
Some
mischievous
urchins
having
scaled
the
garden
wall
,
one
of
them
fell
within
it
,
and
his
cries
so
terrified
his
playmates
that
they
dropped
on
the
other
side
,
and
left
him
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
reconnoitred
the
unhappy
urchin
,
who
continued
his
vociferations
in
a
loud
key
,
through
the
holes
in
the
shutters
,
uncertain
what
to
do
,
and
fearing
that
this
trifling
mischance
might
lead
to
serious
consequences
,
when
the
subject
of
their
uneasiness
relieved
them
by
scrambling
up
the
wall
near
the
door
,
and
so
effecting
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
With
this
exception
,
nothing
material
occurred
till
evening
,
when
their
expected
associates
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
utmost
caution
was
observed
in
admitting
them
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
were
provided
with
a
key
of
the
garden
-
gate
,
but
a
signal
was
given
and
repeated
before
the
house
-
door
was
opened
by
Bates
,
to
whom
the
office
of
porter
was
intrusted
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
latter
had
satisfied
himself
that
all
was
right
,
by
unmasking
a
dark
lantern
,
and
throwing
its
radiance
upon
the
faces
of
the
elder
Wright
,
Rookwood
,
and
Percy
,
he
stamped
his
foot
thrice
,
and
the
conspirators
emerged
from
their
hiding
-
places
.
<EOS>
A
warm
greeting
passed
between
the
confederates
,
and
they
adjourned
to
a
lower
chamber
,
adjoining
the
vault
,
where
the
sound
of
their
voices
could
not
be
overheard
,
and
where
,
while
partaking
of
a
frugal
meal
—
for
they
desired
to
eke
out
their
store
of
provisions
as
long
as
possible
—
they
discoursed
upon
their
plans
,
and
all
that
had
occurred
since
their
last
meeting
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
said
of
the
treachery
of
Tresham
—
his
recent
conduct
,
as
already
observed
,
having
been
such
as
to
restore
him
in
a
great
degree
to
the
confidence
of
his
companions
.
<EOS>
Percy
,
whose
office
as
a
gentleman
-
pensioner
gave
him
the
best
opportunities
of
hearing
court
-
whispers
and
secrets
,
informed
them
it
was
rumoured
that
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
had
obtained
a
clue
to
some
Catholic
plot
,
whether
their
own
he
could
not
say
;
but
it
would
seem
from
all
that
could
be
gathered
,
that
his
endeavours
to
trace
it
out
had
been
frustrated
.
<EOS>
"Where
is
Lord
Mounteagle
?
"
demanded
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
his
mansion
near
Hoxton
,
"
replied
Percy
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
observed
him
much
about
the
court
of
late
,
or
with
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Percy
.
"
<EOS>
Yet
now
,
I
bethink
me
,
I
did
observe
them
together
,
and
in
earnest
conversation
about
a
week
ago
.
<EOS>
But
Lord
Mounteagle
knows
nothing
of
our
plot
.
<EOS>
""Hum
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
while
significant
looks
were
exchanged
by
the
others
,
and
Tresham
hung
his
head
.
"
<EOS>
Lord
Mounteagle
may
not
know
that
you
or
I
,
or
Fawkes
,
or
Rookwood
,
are
conspiring
against
the
State
;
but
he
knows
that
a
plot
is
hatching
amongst
our
party
.
<EOS>
It
is
from
him
that
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
derived
his
information
.
""Amazement
!
"
exclaimed
Percy
.
<EOS>
"A
good
Catholic
,
and
betray
his
fellows
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Rookwood
;
"
this
passes
my
comprehension
.
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
of
it?""Unhappily
we
are
so
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"We
will
speak
of
this
hereafter
,
"
interposed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
plan
to
get
his
lordship
into
our
power
,
and
make
him
serve
our
purposes
in
spite
of
himself
.
<EOS>
We
will
outwit
the
crafty
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
Can
any
one
tell
if
Tresham
's
sudden
disappearance
has
been
noticed
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
household
report
that
he
is
on
a
visit
to
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
at
Gothurst
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
I
called
at
his
residence
yesterday
,
and
was
informed
that
a
letter
had
just
been
received
from
him
dated
from
that
place
.
<EOS>
His
departure
,
they
said
,
was
sudden
,
but
his
letter
fully
accounted
for
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
messenger
who
bore
that
letter
had
only
to
travel
from
Lambeth
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
conclude
,
"
returned
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"And
,
now
that
our
meal
is
ended
,
let
us
to
work
,
"
cried
Fawkes
,
who
had
taken
no
part
in
the
foregoing
conversation
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
strike
the
first
blow
,
"
he
added
,
rising
and
seizing
a
mattock
.
<EOS>
"Hold
,
my
son
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
,
arresting
him
.
"
<EOS>
The
work
upon
which
the
redemption
of
our
holy
church
hangs
must
be
commenced
with
due
solemnity
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
humbly
.
<EOS>
Headed
by
Garnet
,
bearing
a
crucifix
,
they
then
repaired
to
the
vault
.
<EOS>
A
silver
chalice
,
filled
with
holy
water
,
was
carried
by
Fawkes
,
and
two
lighted
tapers
by
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Kneeling
down
before
that
part
of
the
wall
against
which
operations
were
about
to
be
directed
,
and
holding
the
crucifix
towards
it
,
Garnet
commenced
praying
in
a
low
but
earnest
tone
,
gradually
raising
his
voice
,
and
increasing
in
fervour
as
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
The
others
knelt
around
him
,
and
the
whole
formed
a
strange
and
deeply
-
interesting
group
.
<EOS>
The
vault
itself
harmonized
with
its
occupants
.
<EOS>
It
was
of
great
antiquity
;
and
its
solid
stone
masonry
had
acquired
a
time
-
worn
hoary
tint
.
<EOS>
In
width
it
was
about
nine
feet
,
and
of
corresponding
height
,
supported
by
a
semi
-
circular
arch
,
and
its
length
was
more
than
twenty
feet
.
<EOS>
The
countenances
of
the
conspirators
showed
that
they
were
powerfully
moved
by
what
was
passing
;
but
next
to
Garnet
,
Guy
Fawkes
exhibited
the
greatest
enthusiasm
.
<EOS>
His
ecstatic
looks
and
gestures
evinced
the
strong
effect
produced
upon
his
superstitious
character
by
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Garnet
concluded
his
prayer
as
follows:—"Thus
far
,
O
Lord
,
we
have
toiled
in
darkness
and
in
difficulty
;
but
we
have
now
arrived
at
a
point
where
all
thy
support
is
needed
.
<EOS>
Do
not
desert
us
,
we
beseech
thee
,
but
let
thy
light
guide
us
through
these
gloomy
paths
.
<EOS>
Nerve
our
arms,—sharpen
our
weapons,—and
crumble
these
hard
and
flinty
stones
,
so
that
they
may
yield
to
our
efforts
.
<EOS>
Aid
our
enterprise
,
if
thou
approvest
it
,
and
it
be
really
,
as
in
our
ignorance
we
believe
it
to
be
,
for
the
welfare
of
thy
holy
Church
,
and
the
confusion
of
its
enemies
.
<EOS>
Bear
witness
,
O
Lord
,
that
we
devote
ourselves
wholly
and
entirely
to
this
one
<EOS>
end,—and
<EOS>
that
we
implore
success
only
for
thy
glory
and
honour
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
he
arose
,
and
the
following
strains
were
chanted
by
the
whole
assemblage:—HYMN
OF
THE
CONSPIRATORS.The
heretic
and
heathen
,
Lord
,
Consume
with
fire
,
cut
down
with
sword
;
The
spoilers
from
thy
temples
thrust
,
Their
altars
trample
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
False
princes
and
false
priests
lay
low
,
Their
habitations
fill
with
woe
.
<EOS>
Scatter
them
,
Lord
,
with
sword
and
flame
,
And
bring
them
utterly
to
shame
.
<EOS>
Thy
vengeful
arm
no
longer
stay
,
Arise
!
<EOS>
exterminate
,
and
slay
.
<EOS>
So
shall
thy
fallen
worship
be
Restored
to
its
prosperity
.
<EOS>
This
hymn
raised
the
enthusiasm
of
the
conspirators
to
the
highest
pitch
,
and
such
was
the
effect
produced
by
it
,
as
it
rolled
in
sullen
echoes
along
the
arched
roof
of
the
vault
,
that
several
of
them
drew
their
swords
,
and
crossed
the
blades
,
with
looks
of
the
most
determined
devotion
to
their
cause
.
<EOS>
When
it
was
ended
,
Garnet
recited
other
prayers
,
and
sprinkled
holy
water
upon
the
wall
,
and
upon
every
implement
about
to
be
used
,
bestowing
a
separate
benediction
on
each
.
<EOS>
As
he
delivered
the
pick
-
axe
to
Guy
Fawkes
,
he
cried
in
a
solemn
voice—"Strike
,
my
son
,
in
the
name
of
the
Most
High
,
and
in
behalf
of
our
holy
religion,—strike!"Guy
Fawkes
raised
the
weapon
,
and
stimulated
by
excitement
,
threw
the
whole
strength
of
his
arm
into
the
blow
.
<EOS>
A
large
piece
of
the
granite
was
chipped
off
,
but
the
mattock
snapped
in
twain
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
looked
deeply
disconcerted
,
and
Garnet
,
though
he
concealed
his
emotion
,
was
filled
with
dismay
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
take
your
place
,
"
cried
Keyes
,
advancing
,
as
Guy
Fawkes
retired
.
<EOS>
Keyes
was
a
powerful
man
,
and
exerting
his
energies
,
he
buried
the
point
of
the
pick
-
axe
so
deeply
in
the
mortar
,
that
he
could
not
remove
it
unassisted
.
<EOS>
These
untoward
circumstances
cast
a
slight
damp
upon
their
ardour
;
but
Catesby
,
who
perceived
it
,
went
more
cautiously
to
work
,
and
in
a
short
time
succeeded
with
great
labour
in
getting
out
the
large
stone
upon
which
the
others
had
expended
so
much
useless
exertion
.
<EOS>
The
sight
restored
their
confidence
,
and
as
many
as
could
work
in
the
narrow
space
joined
him
.
<EOS>
But
they
found
that
their
task
was
much
more
arduous
than
they
had
anticipated
.
<EOS>
More
than
an
hour
elapsed
before
they
could
loosen
another
stone
,
and
though
they
laboured
with
the
utmost
perseverance
,
relieving
each
other
by
turns
,
they
had
made
but
a
small
breach
when
morning
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
stones
were
as
hard
and
unyielding
as
iron
,
and
the
mortar
in
some
places
harder
than
the
stones
.
<EOS>
After
a
few
hours
'
rest
,
they
resumed
their
task
.
<EOS>
Still
,
they
made
but
small
progress
;
and
it
was
not
until
the
third
day
that
they
had
excavated
a
hole
sufficiently
wide
and
deep
to
admit
one
man
within
it
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
arrived
at
a
compost
of
gravel
and
flint
stones
;
and
if
they
had
found
their
previous
task
difficult
,
what
they
had
now
to
encounter
was
infinitely
more
so
.
<EOS>
Their
implements
made
little
or
no
impression
on
this
unyielding
substance
,
and
though
they
toiled
incessantly
,
the
work
proceeded
with
disheartening
slowness
.
<EOS>
The
stones
and
rubbish
were
conveyed
at
dead
of
night
in
hampers
into
the
garden
,
and
buried
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
when
they
were
labouring
as
usual
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
was
foremost
in
the
excavation
,
thought
he
heard
the
tolling
of
a
bell
within
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
suspended
his
task
,
and
being
convinced
that
he
was
not
deceived
,
crept
out
of
the
hole
,
and
made
a
sign
to
the
others
to
listen
.
<EOS>
Each
had
heard
the
awful
sound
before
;
but
as
it
was
partially
drowned
by
the
noise
of
the
pick
-
axe
,
it
had
not
produced
much
impression
upon
them
,
as
they
attributed
it
to
some
vibration
in
the
wall
,
caused
by
the
echo
of
the
blows
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
now
distinctly
audible
—
deep
,
clear
,
slow,—like
<EOS>
a
passing
bell,—but
<EOS>
so
solemn
,
so
unearthly
,
that
its
tones
froze
the
blood
in
their
veins
.
<EOS>
IllustrationThey
listened
for
a
while
in
speechless
astonishment
,
scarcely
daring
to
look
at
each
other
,
and
expecting
each
moment
that
the
building
would
fall
upon
them
,
and
bury
them
alive
.
<EOS>
The
light
of
a
single
lantern
placed
upon
an
upturned
basket
fell
upon
figures
rigid
as
statues
,
and
countenances
charged
with
awe
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
arm
is
paralysed
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
breaking
silence
;
"
I
can
work
no
more
.
<EOS>
""Try
<EOS>
holy
water
,
father
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
it
proceeds
from
aught
of
evil
,
that
will
quell
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
chalice
containing
the
sacred
lymph
was
brought
,
and
pronouncing
a
solemn
exorcism
,
Garnet
sprinkled
the
wall
.
<EOS>
The
sound
immediately
ceased
.
<EOS>
"It
is
as
I
thought
,
father
,
"
observed
Catesby
;
"
it
is
the
delusion
of
an
evil
spirit
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
tolling
of
the
mysterious
bell
was
again
heard
,
and
more
solemnly,—more
slowly
than
before
.
<EOS>
"Sprinkle
<EOS>
the
wall
again
,
in
Heaven
's
name
,
father
,
"
cried
Fawkes
,
crossing
himself
devoutly
.
"
<EOS>
Avoid
thee
,
Sathanas!"Garnet
complied
,
and
throwing
holy
water
upon
the
stones
,
the
same
result
followed
.
<EOS>
V.
—
THE
CAPTURE
OF
VIVIANAOn
<EOS>
the
morning
after
his
encounter
with
Guy
Fawkes
,
Humphrey
Chetham
,
accompanied
by
Martin
Heydocke
,
took
his
way
to
Lambeth
Marsh
.
<EOS>
With
a
throbbing
heart
he
approached
the
miserable
dwelling
he
knew
to
be
inhabited
by
Viviana
,
and
could
scarcely
summon
courage
to
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
His
first
summons
not
being
answered
,
he
repeated
it
more
loudly
,
and
he
then
perceived
the
face
of
Father
Oldcorne
at
the
window
,
who
,
having
satisfied
himself
that
it
was
a
friend
,
admitted
him
and
his
attendant
.
<EOS>
"You
were
expected
,
my
son
,
"
said
the
priest
,
after
a
friendly
greeting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
has
prepared
Viviana
for
your
coming
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
she
not
see
me
?
"
demanded
the
young
merchant
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"I
believe
so
,
"
replied
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
will
apprise
her
of
your
arrival
.
<EOS>
Be
seated
,
my
son
.
"He
<EOS>
then
carefully
fastened
the
door
,
and
repaired
to
Viviana
's
chamber
,
leaving
Chetham
in
that
state
of
tremor
and
anxiety
which
a
lover
,
hoping
to
behold
his
mistress
,
only
knows
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
time
before
Viviana
appeared
,
and
the
young
merchant
,
whose
heart
beat
violently
at
the
sound
of
her
footstep
,
was
startled
by
the
alteration
in
her
looks
,
and
the
extreme
coldness
of
her
manner
.
<EOS>
Oldcorne
was
with
her
,
and
motioning
Martin
Heydocke
to
follow
him
,
the
youthful
pair
were
left
alone
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
desire
to
see
me
<EOS>
,
I
am
given
to
understand
,
sir
,
"
observed
Viviana
,
in
a
freezing
tone
.
<EOS>
"I
have
journeyed
to
London
for
that
express
purpose
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
tremulously
.
<EOS>
"I
am
much
beholden
to
you
,
sir
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
in
the
same
repelling
tone
as
before
;
"
but
I
regret
you
should
have
taken
so
much
trouble
on
my
account
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
serve
you
is
happiness
,
not
trouble
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
ardently
;
"
and
I
am
overjoyed
at
finding
an
opportunity
of
proving
my
devotion
.
<EOS>
""I
have
yet
to
learn
what
service
I
must
thank
you
for
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"I
can
scarcely
say
that
I
am
warranted
in
thus
intruding
upon
you
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
greatly
abashed
;
"
but
,
having
learnt
from
my
servant
,
Martin
Heydocke
,
that
Doctor
Dee
had
set
out
for
London
,
with
the
view
of
seeking
you
out
,
and
withdrawing
you
from
your
present
associates
,
I
was
determined
to
be
beforehand
with
him
,
and
to
acquaint
you
,
if
possible
,
with
his
intentions
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
you
say
surprises
me
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
has
no
right
to
interfere
with
my
actions
.
<EOS>
Nor
should
I
obey
him
<EOS>
were
he
to
counsel
me
,
as
is
scarcely
probable
,
to
quit
my
companions
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
what
connexion
there
may
be
between
you
to
justify
the
interposition
of
his
authority
,
"
replied
Chetham
;
"
neither
did
I
tarry
to
inquire
.
<EOS>
But
presuming
from
what
I
heard
,
that
he
would
attempt
to
exercise
some
control
over
you
,
I
set
out
at
once
,
and
,
without
guide
to
your
retreat
,
or
the
slightest
knowledge
of
it
,
was
fortunate
enough
,
on
the
very
night
of
my
arrival
in
London
,
to
chance
upon
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
directed
me
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
am
aware
of
it
,
"
was
the
chilling
answer
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
avouch
,
"
pursued
Chetham
,
passionately
,
"
that
I
have
not
been
actuated
as
much
by
an
irrepressible
desire
to
see
you
again
,
as
by
anxiety
to
apprise
you
of
Doctor
Dee
's
coming
.
<EOS>
I
wanted
only
a
slight
excuse
to
myself
to
induce
me
to
yield
to
my
inclinations
.
<EOS>
Your
departure
made
me
wretched
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
had
more
control
over
myself
.
<EOS>
But
I
find
I
can
not
live
without
you
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
in
a
troubled
tone
,
and
losing
all
her
self
-
command
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
this
.
<EOS>
Why
—
why
did
you
come?""I
have
told
you
my
motive
,
"
replied
Chetham
;
"
but
,
<EOS>
oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
reproach
me!""I
do
not
desire
to
do
so
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
with
a
look
of
agony
.
<EOS>
"
I
bitterly
reproach
myself
that
I
can
not
meet
you
as
of
old
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
rather
—
far
rather
have
encountered
Doctor
Dee
,
had
he
come
hither
resolved
to
exert
all
his
magical
power
to
force
me
away
,
than
have
met
you
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
I
unwittingly
offended
you
,
Viviana
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Chetham
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
no
—
no
—
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
,
"
you
have
not
offended
me
;
<EOS>
but——""But
what
?
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"I
would
rather
have
died
than
see
you
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
inquire
wherefore
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
"
because
I
too
well
divine
the
cause
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
longer
what
I
was
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Press
<EOS>
this
matter
<EOS>
no
further
,
I
pray
of
you
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
in
much
confusion
,
and
blushing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
ever
esteem
you,—ever
feel
the
warmest
gratitude
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
what
matters
it
whether
my
heart
is
estranged
from
you
or
not
,
since
I
can
never
we
d
<EOS>
you?""What
matters
it
?
<EOS>
"
repeated
the
young
merchant
,
in
accents
of
despair,—"it
matters
much
.
<EOS>
Drowning
love
will
cling
to
straws
.
<EOS>
The
thought
that
I
was
beloved
by
you
,
though
I
could
never
hope
to
possess
your
hand
,
reconciled
me
in
some
degree
to
my
fate
.
<EOS>
But
now
,
"
he
added
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands,—"now
,
my
heart
is
crushed
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
say
not
so
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
in
a
voice
of
the
deepest
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
love
you,—as
a
sister
.
<EOS>
""That
is
small
comfort
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
I
echo
your
own
wish
.
<EOS>
Would
we
had
never
met
again
!
<EOS>
I
might
,
at
least
,
have
deluded
myself
into
the
belief
that
you
loved
me
.
<EOS>
""It
would
have
been
better
so
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
inflict
pain
on
no
one
—
far
less
on
you
,
whom
I
regard
so
much
,
and
to
whom
I
owe
so
much
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
owe
me
nothing
,
Viviana
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
desired
was
to
serve
you
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
dangers
we
have
shared
together
,
I
felt
no
alarm
except
for
your
sake
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
nothing
—
nothing
.
<EOS>
Would
I
had
died
for
you!""Calm
yourself
,
<EOS>
sir
,
I
entreat
you
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
did
love
me
once
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Chetham
,
suddenly
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
so
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
The
young
merchant
uttered
an
exclamation
of
anguish
,
and
a
mournful
pause
ensued
,
broken
only
by
his
groans
.
<EOS>
"Answer
<EOS>
me
,
Viviana
,
"
he
said
,
turning
abruptly
upon
her,—"answer
me
,
and
,
in
mercy
,
answer
truly,—do
<EOS>
you
love
another?""It
<EOS>
is
a
question
I
can
not
answer
,
"
she
replied
,
becoming
ashy
pale
.
<EOS>
"Your
looks
speak
for
you
!
"
<EOS>
he
vociferated
,
in
a
terrible
tone,—"you
do
!
<EOS>
His
name?—his
name?—that
<EOS>
I
may
wreak
my
vengeance
upon
him
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
violence
terrifies
me
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
withdrawing
the
hand
he
had
seized
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
put
an
end
to
this
interview
.
<EOS>
""Pardon
me
,
Viviana
!
"
cried
Chetham
,
falling
on
his
knees
before
her—"in
pity
pardon
me
!
<EOS>
I
am
not
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
calmer
presently
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
knew
the
anguish
of
the
wound
you
have
inflicted
,
you
would
not
add
to
it
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
knows
I
would
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
returned
,
motioning
him
to
rise
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
if
it
will
lighten
your
suffering
,
know
that
the
love
I
feel
for
another
—
if
love
,
indeed
,
it
be,—is
as
hopeless
as
your
own
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
not
a
love
of
which
even
you
could
be
jealous
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
higher
and
a
holier
passion
.
<EOS>
It
is
affection
mixed
with
admiration
,
and
purified
from
all
its
grossness
.
<EOS>
It
is
more
,
perhaps
,
than
the
love
of
a
daughter
for
her
father
—
but
it
is
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
I
shall
never
we
d
him
<EOS>
I
love
—
could
not
if
I
would
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
would
shun
him
,
if
I
did
not
feel
that
the
hour
will
soon
come
when
the
extent
of
my
affection
must
be
proved
.
<EOS>
""This
is
strange
sophistry
,
"
returned
Chetham
;
"
and
you
may
deceive
yourself
by
it
,
but
you
can
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
You
love
as
all
ardent
natures
do
love
.
<EOS>
But
in
what
way
do
you
mean
to
prove
your
affection?""Perhaps
,
by
the
sacrifice
of
my
life
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"I
can
tell
you
who
is
the
object
of
your
affections
!
"
said
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
deny
it
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
he
is
.
<EOS>
""Hear
<EOS>
me
,
then
,
"
exclaimed
Chetham
,
who
appeared
inexpressibly
relieved
by
the
discovery
he
had
made
;
"
in
my
passage
across
the
river
with
him
last
night
,
our
conversation
turned
on
the
one
subject
ever
nearest
<EOS>
my
heart
<EOS>
,
yourself,—and
Guy
Fawkes
not
only
bade
me
not
despair
,
but
promised
to
aid
my
suit
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
he
kept
his
word
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
for
,
while
announcing
your
proposed
visit
,
he
urged
me
strongly
in
your
behalf
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
knows
not
of
your
love
for
him
?
"
demanded
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
not
only
knows
it
not
,
but
never
shall
know
it
from
me,—nor
<EOS>
must
he
know
it
from
you
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
energetically
.
<EOS>
"Fear
<EOS>
it
not
,
"
said
Chetham
,
sighing
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
secret
I
shall
carefully
preserve
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
now
that
you
are
in
possession
of
it
,
"
she
answered
,
"
I
no
longer
feel
your
presence
as
a
restraint
.
<EOS>
Let
me
still
regard
you
as
a
friend
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
mournfully
;
"
and
<EOS>
as
a
friend
let
me
entreat
you
to
quit
this
place
,
and
abandon
your
present
associates
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
seek
to
turn
your
heart
from
Fawkes
—
nor
will
I
try
to
regain
the
love
I
have
lost
.
<EOS>
But
let
me
implore
you
to
pause
ere
you
irretrievably
mix
yourself
up
with
the
fortunes
of
one
so
desperate
.
<EOS>
I
am
too
well
aware
that
he
is
engaged
in
a
fearful
plot
against
the
State,—though
<EOS>
I
know
not
its
precise
nature
.
<EOS>
""You
will
not
betray
him
?
"
<EOS>
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
not
,
though
he
is
my
rival
,
"
returned
Chetham
.
"
<EOS>
But
others
may
—
nay
,
perhaps
have
done
so
already
.
<EOS>
""Whom
<EOS>
do
you
suspect
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Viviana
,
in
the
greatest
alarm
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
Doctor
Dee
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
;
"
but
I
know
nothing
certainly
.
<EOS>
My
servant
,
Martin
Heydocke
,
who
is
in
the
Doctor
's
confidence
,
intimated
as
much
to
me
,
and
I
have
reason
to
think
that
his
journey
to
town
,
under
the
pretext
of
searching
for
you
,
is
undertaken
for
the
purpose
of
tracing
out
the
conspirators
,
and
delivering
them
to
the
Government
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
he
arrived
in
London
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Viviana
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
should
think
not
,
"
returned
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
I
passed
him
,
four
days
ago
,
on
this
side
Leicester
,
in
company
with
Kelley
and
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
""If
the
wretch
Topcliffe
was
with
him
<EOS>
,
your
conjectures
are
too
well
founded
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
warn
Guy
Fawkes
instantly
of
his
danger
.
<EOS>
""Command
my
services
in
any
way
,
"
said
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
not
what
to
do
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
after
a
pause
,
during
which
she
betrayed
the
greatest
agitation
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
seek
him
out;—and
<EOS>
yet
,
if
I
do
not
,
he
may
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
him
at
all
hazards
.
<EOS>
""Suffer
<EOS>
me
to
go
with
you
,
"
implored
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
rely
upon
my
secrecy
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
a
double
motive
for
desiring
to
preserve
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
""You
are
,
indeed
,
truly
noble
-
hearted
and
generous
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
and
I
would
fully
confide
in
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
were
to
be
seen
by
the
others
,
you
would
be
certainly
put
to
death
.
<EOS>
Not
even
Fawkes
could
save
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
risk
it
,
if
you
desire
it
,
and
it
will
save
him
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
,
devotedly
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
will
go
alone
.
<EOS>
""That
were
to
insure
your
destruction
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
No
—
no
—
it
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
I
will
consult
with
Father
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
and
returned
in
a
short
time
with
the
priest
.
<EOS>
"Father
<EOS>
Oldcorne
is
of
opinion
that
our
friends
must
be
apprised
of
their
danger
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
And
he
thinks
it
needful
<EOS>
we
should
both
go
to
their
retreat
,
that
no
hindrance
may
be
offered
to
our
flight
,
in
case
such
a
measure
should
be
resolved
upon
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
can
not
accompany
us
,
my
son
,
"
added
Oldcorne
;
"
for
though
I
am
as
fully
assured
of
your
fidelity
as
Viviana
,
and
would
confide
my
life
to
you
,
there
are
those
who
will
not
so
trust
you
,
and
who
might
rejoice
in
the
opportunity
of
removing
you
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
!
"
exclaimed
Chetham
,
looking
entreatingly
at
her
.
"For
<EOS>
my
sake,—if
not
for
your
own,—do
not
urge
this
further
,
"
she
returned
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
already
dangers
and
difficulties
enow
without
adding
to
them
.
<EOS>
You
would
be
safer
amid
a
horde
of
robbers
than
amidst
these
men
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
it
is
to
such
persons
you
commit
yourself
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Chetham
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
!
be
warned
by
me
,
ere
it
is
too
late
!
<EOS>
Abandon
them!""It
is
too
late
,
already
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
The
die
is
cast
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
can
only
lament
it
,
"
returned
Chetham
,
sadly
.
"
<EOS>
Suffer
me
,
at
least
,
to
accompany
you
to
some
place
near
their
retreat
,
that
you
may
summon
me
in
case
of
need
.
<EOS>
""There
can
be
no
objection
to
that
,
Viviana
,
"
observed
Oldcorne
;
"
provided
Humphrey
Chetham
will
promise
not
to
follow
us
.
<EOS>
""Readily
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
"I
am
unwilling
to
expose
him
to
further
risk
on
my
account
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
be
it
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
"It
was
then
agreed
,
that
they
should
not
set
out
till
nightfall
,
but
proceed
,
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
,
to
Lambeth
,
where
Humphrey
Chetham
undertook
to
procure
a
boat
for
their
conveyance
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
The
hour
of
departure
at
length
arrived
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
who
had
withdrawn
to
her
own
room
,
appeared
in
her
travelling
habit
,
and
was
about
to
set
forth
with
her
companions
,
when
they
were
all
startled
by
a
sudden
and
loud
knocking
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"We
are
discovered
,
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Doctor
Dee
has
found
out
our
retreat
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
drawing
his
sword
,
while
his
example
was
imitated
by
Martin
Heydocke
;
"
they
shall
not
capture
you
while
I
live
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
knocking
was
repeated
,
and
the
door
shaken
so
violently
as
to
threaten
to
burst
its
fastenings
.
<EOS>
"Extinguish
<EOS>
the
light
,
"
whispered
Chetham
,
"
and
let
Father
Oldcorne
conceal
himself
.
<EOS>
We
have
nothing
to
fear
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
shall
I
fly
?
"
cried
Oldcorne
despairingly
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
be
impossible
to
raise
the
flag
,
and
seek
refuge
in
the
vault
.
<EOS>
""Fly
<EOS>
to
my
room
,
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
And
finding
he
stood
irresolute
,
as
if
paralysed
with
terror
,
she
took
his
arm
,
and
dragged
him
away
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
the
door
was
burst
open
with
a
loud
crash
,
and
several
armed
men
,
with
their
swords
drawn
,
followed
by
Topcliffe
,
and
another
middle
-
aged
man
,
of
slight
stature
,
and
rather
under
-
sized
,
but
richly
dressed
,
and
bearing
all
the
marks
of
exalted
rank
,
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"You
are
my
prisoner
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Topcliffe
,
rushing
up
to
Chetham
,
who
had
planted
himself
,
with
Martin
Heydocke
,
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"
I
arrest
you
in
the
King
's
name!""You
are
mistaken
in
your
man
,
sir
,
"
cried
Chetham
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
committed
no
offence
.
<EOS>
Lay
a
hand
upon
me
,
at
your
peril!""How
is
this
?
"
cried
Topcliffe
.
"
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
here!""Ay
,
"
returned
the
young
merchant
;
"
you
have
fallen
upon
the
wrong
house
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
satisfied
from
your
presence
that
I
am
right
.
<EOS>
Where
you
are
,
Viviana
Radcliffe
is
not
far
off
.
<EOS>
Throw
down
your
arms
.
<EOS>
You
can
offer
no
resistance
to
my
force
,
and
your
zeal
will
not
benefit
your
friends
,
while
it
will
place
your
own
safety
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
Chetham
fiercely
refused
compliance
,
and
after
a
few
minutes
'
further
parley
,
the
soldiers
were
about
to
attack
him
,
when
Viviana
opened
a
door
above
,
and
slowly
descended
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
At
her
appearance
the
young
merchant
,
seeing
that
further
resistance
would
be
useless
,
sheathed
his
sword
,
and
she
passed
between
him
and
Heydocke
,
and
advanced
towards
the
leaders
of
the
band
.
<EOS>
"What
means
this
intrusion
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"We
are
come
in
search
of
two
Jesuit
priests
,
whom
we
have
obtained
information
are
hidden
here
,
"
replied
Topcliffe;—"as
well
as
of
certain
other
Papists
,
disaffected
against
the
State
,
for
whose
apprehension
I
hold
a
warrant
.
<EOS>
""You
are
welcome
to
search
the
house
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
there
is
no
one
within
it
except
those
you
see
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
she
said
this
,
Chetham
,
who
gazed
earnestly
at
her
,
caught
her
eye
,
and
from
a
scarcely
-
perceptible
glance
,
felt
certain
that
the
priest
,
through
her
agency
,
had
effected
his
escape
.
<EOS>
But
the
soldiers
had
not
waited
for
her
permission
to
make
the
search
.
<EOS>
Rushing
up
-
stairs
they
examined
the
different
chambers,—there
were
two
small
rooms
besides
that
occupied
by
Viviana,—and
found
several
of
the
priests
'
habiliments
;
but
though
they
examined
every
corner
with
the
minutest
attention
,
sounded
the
walls
,
peered
up
the
chimneys
,
underneath
the
bed
,
and
into
every
place
,
likely
and
unlikely
,
they
could
find
no
other
traces
of
those
they
sought
,
and
were
compelled
to
return
to
their
leader
with
tidings
of
their
ill
success
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
,
with
another
party
,
continued
his
scrutiny
below
,
and
discovering
the
moveable
flag
in
the
hearth
,
descended
into
the
vault
,
where
he
made
certain
of
discovering
his
prey
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
was
there
;
and
,
the
powder
and
arms
having
been
removed
,
he
gained
nothing
by
his
investigations
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
his
companion,—and
evidently
from
his
garb
,
and
the
deference
paid
him
,
though
he
was
addressed
by
no
title
which
could
lead
to
the
absolute
knowledge
of
his
rank
,
his
superior,—seated
himself
,
and
put
many
questions
in
a
courteous
but
authoritative
tone
to
Viviana
respecting
her
residence
in
this
solitary
abode,—the
names
of
her
companions,—where
<EOS>
they
were,—and
<EOS>
upon
what
scheme
they
were
engaged
.
<EOS>
To
none
of
these
questions
would
she
return
an
answer
,
and
her
interrogator
,
at
last
,
losing
patience
,
said,"I
hold
it
my
duty
,
to
inform
you
that
you
will
be
carried
before
the
Council
,
and
if
you
continue
thus
obstinate
,
means
will
be
taken
—
and
those
none
of
the
gentlest
—
to
extort
the
truth
from
you
.
<EOS>
""You
may
apply
the
torture
to
me
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
firmly
;
"
but
it
will
wrest
nothing
from
me
.
<EOS>
""That
remains
to
be
seen
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
I
only
trust
you
will
not
compel
me
to
put
my
threat
into
execution
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
Topcliffe
emerged
from
the
vault
,
and
the
soldiers
returned
from
their
unsuccessful
search
above
.
<EOS>
"They
have
escaped
us
now
,
"
remarked
Topcliffe
to
his
superior
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
will
conceal
a
party
of
men
on
the
premises
,
who
will
be
certain
to
capture
them
on
their
return
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
uttered
an
exclamation
of
irrepressible
uneasiness
,
which
did
not
escape
her
auditors
.
<EOS>
"I
am
right
<EOS>
,
you
see
,
"
observed
Topcliffe
,
significantly
,
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"You
are
so
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
As
this
was
said
,
Viviana
hazarded
a
look
at
Humphrey
Chetham
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
was
not
slow
to
comprehend
.
<EOS>
He
saw
that
she
wished
him
to
make
an
effort
to
escape
,
that
he
might
warn
her
companions
,
and
regardless
of
the
consequence
,
be
prepared
to
obey
her
.
<EOS>
While
those
around
were
engaged
in
a
last
fruitless
search
,
he
whispered
his
intentions
to
Martin
Heydocke
,
and
only
awaited
a
favourable
opportunity
to
put
them
in
execution
.
<EOS>
It
occurred
sooner
than
he
expected
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
the
premises
,
Topcliffe
determined
to
visit
the
upper
rooms
himself
,
and
he
took
several
of
the
men
with
him
.
<EOS>
Chetham
would
have
made
an
attempt
to
liberate
Viviana
,
but
,
feeling
certain
it
would
be
unsuccessful
,
he
preferred
obeying
her
wishes
to
his
own
inclinations
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
gone
,
he
suddenly
drew
his
sword,—for
<EOS>
neither
he
nor
Heydocke
had
been
disarmed,—and
rushing
towards
the
door
,
struck
down
the
man
next
it
,
and
followed
by
his
servant
,
passed
through
it
before
he
could
be
intercepted
.
<EOS>
They
both
then
flew
at
a
swift
pace
towards
the
marshy
fields
,
and
,
owing
to
the
darkness
and
unstable
nature
of
the
ground
,
speedily
distanced
their
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
disturbance
below
,
and
guessing
its
cause
,
Topcliffe
immediately
descended
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
late
;
and
though
he
joined
in
the
pursuit
,
he
was
baffled
like
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
,
he
returned
to
the
house
with
an
angry
and
disappointed
look
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
given
us
the
slip
,
"
he
observed
to
his
superior
,
who
appeared
exceedingly
provoked
by
the
young
merchant
's
flight
;
"
But
we
will
soon
have
him
again
.
"After
<EOS>
giving
directions
to
his
men
how
to
conceal
themselves
,
Topcliffe
informed
his
companions
that
he
was
ready
to
attend
him
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
who
had
remained
motionless
and
silent
during
the
foregoing
scene
,
was
taken
out
of
the
house
,
and
conducted
towards
the
creek
,
in
which
lay
a
large
wherry
manned
by
four
rowers
.
<EOS>
She
was
placed
within
it
,
and
as
soon
as
his
superior
was
seated
,
Topcliffe
inquired—"Where
will
your
lordship
go
first?""To
<EOS>
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
At
this
reply
,
in
spite
of
herself
,
Viviana
could
not
repress
a
shudder
.
<EOS>
"All
is
lost
!
"
she
mentally
ejaculated
.

—
<EOS>
THE
CELLARIt
was
long
before
the
conspirators
gained
sufficient
courage
to
recommence
digging
the
mine
.
<EOS>
Whenever
holy
water
was
thrown
upon
the
stones
,
the
mysterious
bell
ceased
tolling
,
but
it
presently
began
anew
,
and
such
was
the
appalling
effect
of
the
sound
that
it
completely
paralysed
the
listeners
.
<EOS>
Prayers
were
said
by
Garnet
;
hymns
sung
by
the
others
;
but
all
was
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
It
continued
to
toll
on
with
increased
solemnity
,
unless
checked
by
the
same
potent
application
as
before
.
<EOS>
The
effect
became
speedily
manifest
in
the
altered
looks
and
demeanour
of
the
conspirators
,
and
it
was
evident
that
if
something
was
not
done
to
arouse
them
,
the
enterprise
would
be
abandoned
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
equally
superstitious
with
his
confederates
,
but
having
nerves
more
firmly
strung
,
was
the
first
to
conquer
his
terror
.
<EOS>
Crossing
himself
,
he
muttered
a
secret
prayer
,
and
,
snatching
up
a
pick
-
axe
,
entered
the
cavity
,
and
resumed
his
labour
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
heavy
blows
dealt
by
him
against
the
wall
drowned
the
tolling
of
the
bell
.
<EOS>
The
charm
was
broken
.
<EOS>
And
stimulated
by
his
conduct
,
the
others
followed
his
example
,
and
though
the
awful
tolling
continued
at
intervals
during
the
whole
of
their
operations
,
it
offered
no
further
interruption
to
them
.
<EOS>
Another
and
more
serious
cause
of
anxiety
,
however
,
arose
.
<EOS>
As
the
work
advanced
,
without
being
aware
of
it
,
they
approached
the
bank
of
the
river
,
and
the
water
began
to
ooze
through
the
sides
of
the
excavation,—at
first
,
slightly
,
but
by
degrees
to
such
an
extent
as
to
convince
them
that
their
labour
would
be
entirely
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Large
portions
of
the
clay
,
loosened
by
the
damp
,
fell
in
upon
them
,
nearly
burying
those
nearest
the
tumbling
mass
;
and
the
floor
was
now
in
some
places
more
than
a
foot
deep
in
water
,
clearly
proving
it
would
be
utterly
impossible
to
keep
the
powder
fit
for
use
in
such
a
spot
.
<EOS>
Catesby
bore
these
untoward
circumstances
with
ill
-
concealed
mortification
.
<EOS>
For
a
time
,
he
struggled
against
them
;
and
though
he
felt
that
it
was
hopeless
,
worked
on
like
a
desperate
military
leader
conducting
a
forlorn
hope
to
certain
destruction
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
the
water
began
to
make
such
incursions
that
he
could
no
longer
disguise
from
himself
or
his
companions
that
they
were
contending
against
insurmountable
difficulties
,
and
that
to
proceed
further
would
be
madness
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
with
a
heavy
heart
,
desisted
,
and
throwing
down
his
pick
-
axe
,
said
it
was
clear
that
Heaven
did
not
approve
their
design
,
and
that
it
must
be
relinquished
.
<EOS>
"We
ought
to
have
been
warned
by
that
doleful
bell
,
"
he
observed
in
conclusion
.
<EOS>
"
I
now
perceive
its
meaning
.
<EOS>
And
as
I
was
the
first
to
act
in
direct
opposition
to
the
declared
will
of
the
Supreme
Being
,
so
now
I
am
the
first
to
admit
my
error
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
account
for
that
dread
and
mysterious
sound
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
"
and
can
only
attribute
it
,
as
you
do
,
to
Divine
interference
.
<EOS>
But
whether
it
was
intended
as
a
warning
or
a
guidance
,
I
confess
I
am
unable
to
say
.
<EOS>
""Can
you
longer
doubt
,
father
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
bitterly
,
"
when
you
look
at
yon
excavation
?
<EOS>
It
took
us
more
than
a
week
's
incessant
labour
to
get
through
the
first
wall
;
and
our
toil
was
no
sooner
lightened
than
these
fatal
consequences
ensued
.
<EOS>
If
we
proceed
,
we
shall
drown
ourselves
,
instead
of
blowing
up
our
foes
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
we
should
escape
,
were
the
powder
stowed
for
one
day
in
that
damp
place
,
it
would
never
explode
.
<EOS>
We
have
failed
,
and
must
take
measures
accordingly
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
entirely
concur
with
you
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
we
must
abandon
our
present
plan
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
let
us
be
disheartened
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
at
this
very
moment
Heaven
is
preparing
for
us
a
victory
by
some
unlooked
-
for
means
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
with
a
look
of
incredulity
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
an
extraordinary
noise
,
like
a
shower
of
falling
stones
,
was
heard
overhead
.
<EOS>
And
coupling
the
sound
with
their
fears
of
the
encroachment
of
the
damp
,
the
conspirators
glanced
at
each
other
in
dismay
,
thinking
the
building
was
falling
in
upon
them
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
blessed
saints
protect
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Garnet
,
as
the
sound
ceased
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
that?"But
no
one
was
able
to
account
for
it
,
and
each
regarded
his
neighbour
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
interval
of
silence
,
the
sound
was
heard
again
.
<EOS>
There
was
then
another
pause
—
and
again
the
same
rushing
and
inexplicable
noise
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
can
it
be
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
enfeebled
by
this
underground
life
,
that
trifles
alarm
me
.
<EOS>
Are
our
enemies
pulling
down
the
structure
over
our
heads?—or
are
they
earthing
us
up
like
vermin
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it?""I
will
go
and
see
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
expose
yourself
,
my
son
,
"
cried
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
abide
the
result
here
.
<EOS>
""No
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
"
<EOS>
Having
failed
in
our
scheme
,
what
befals
me
is
of
little
consequence
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
.
<EOS>
If
I
return
not
,
you
will
understand
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
"Pausing
for
a
moment
to
receive
Garnet
's
benediction
,
he
then
strode
away
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
elapsed
before
Fawkes
returned
,
and
the
interval
appeared
thrice
its
duration
in
the
eyes
of
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
When
he
re
-
appeared
,
a
smile
sat
upon
his
countenance
,
and
his
looks
instantly
dispelled
the
alarm
that
had
been
previously
felt
.
<EOS>
"You
bring
us
good
news
,
my
son
?
"
cried
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Excellent
,
father
,
"
replied
Fawkes
:
"
and
you
were
right
in
saying
that
at
the
very
moment
we
were
indulging
in
misgiving
,
Heaven
was
preparing
for
us
a
victory
by
unforeseen
and
mysterious
means
.
<EOS>
"Garnet
<EOS>
raised
his
hands
gratefully
and
reverentially
upwards
.
<EOS>
And
the
other
conspirators
crowded
round
Fawkes
to
listen
to
his
relation
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
noise
we
heard
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
"
arose
from
a
very
simple
circumstance,—and
when
you
hear
it
,
you
will
smile
at
your
fears
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
smile
at
the
result
to
which
it
has
led
.
<EOS>
Exactly
overhead
,
it
appears
,
a
cellar
is
situated
,
belonging
to
a
person
named
Bright
,
and
the
sound
was
occasioned
by
the
removal
of
his
coals
,
which
he
had
been
selling
off
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
that
all
?
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
indeed
grown
childish
,
to
be
alarmed
by
such
a
cause
.
<EOS>
""It
appears
slight
now
it
is
explained
,
"
observed
Keyes
,
gravely
;
"
but
how
were
we
to
know
whence
it
arose?""True
,
"
returned
Fawkes
;
"
and
I
will
now
show
you
how
the
hand
of
Heaven
has
been
manifested
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
The
noise
which
led
me
to
this
investigation
,
and
which
I
regard
as
a
signal
from
on
high
,
brought
me
to
a
cellar
I
had
never
seen
before
,
and
knew
not
existed
.
<EOS>
That
cellar
lies
immediately
beneath
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
think
it
would
form
a
good
depository
for
the
powder
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
it
had
been
built
for
the
express
purpose
,
it
could
not
be
better
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
commodious
and
dry
,
and
in
an
out
-
of
-
the
-
way
place
,
as
you
may
judge
,
when
we
ourselves
have
never
hitherto
noticed
it
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
is
all
this
to
us
,
if
we
can
not
use
it
?
<EOS>
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"We
can
use
it
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
ours
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
was
a
general
exclamation
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Finding
<EOS>
,
on
inquiry
,
that
Bright
was
about
to
quit
the
neighbourhood
,
"
continued
Fawkes
,
"
and
did
not
require
the
place
longer
,
I
instantly
proposed
to
take
it
from
him
,
and
to
create
no
suspicion
,
engaged
it
in
Percy
's
name
,
stating
that
he
wanted
it
for
his
own
fuel
.
<EOS>
""You
have
done
admirably
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
in
a
tone
of
exultation
.
<EOS>
"
The
success
of
the
enterprise
will
now
be
entirely
owing
to
you
.
""Not
<EOS>
to
me
,
but
to
the
Providence
that
directed
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
solemnly
.
<EOS>
"Right
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
And
let
this
teach
us
never
to
despair
again
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
next
day
,
Percy
having
taken
possession
of
the
cellar
,
it
was
carefully
examined
,
and
proved
,
as
Fawkes
had
stated
,
admirably
adapted
to
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
Their
fears
were
now
at
an
end
,
and
they
looked
on
the
success
of
their
project
as
certain
.
<EOS>
The
mysterious
bell
no
longer
tolled
,
and
their
sole
remaining
task
was
to
fill
up
the
excavation
so
far
as
to
prevent
any
damage
from
the
wet
.
<EOS>
This
was
soon
done
,
and
their
next
step
was
to
transport
the
powder
during
the
night
to
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
Concealing
the
barrels
as
before
with
faggots
and
coals
,
they
gave
the
place
the
appearance
of
a
mere
receptacle
for
lumber
,
by
filling
it
with
old
hampers
,
boxes
without
lids
,
broken
bottles
,
stone
jars
,
and
other
rubbish
.
<EOS>
They
now
began
to
think
of
separating
,
and
Fawkes
expressed
his
intention
of
returning
that
night
to
the
house
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
No
intelligence
had
reached
them
of
Viviana
's
captivity
,
and
they
supposed
her
still
an
inmate
of
the
miserable
dwelling
with
Father
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
had
often
thought
of
her
,
and
with
uneasiness
,
during
his
toilsome
labours
;
but
they
had
so
much
engrossed
him
that
her
image
was
banished
almost
as
soon
as
it
arose
.
<EOS>
Now
that
grand
obstacle
was
surmounted
,
and
nothing
was
wanting
,
however
,
except
a
favourable
moment
to
strike
the
blow
,
he
began
to
feel
the
greatest
anxiety
respecting
her
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
thought
it
prudent
to
postpone
his
return
to
a
late
hour
,
and
it
was
not
until
near
midnight
that
he
and
Catesby
ventured
to
their
boat
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
descend
the
steps
,
he
heard
his
name
pronounced
by
some
one
at
a
little
distance
;
and
the
next
moment
,
a
man
,
whom
he
immediately
recognised
as
Humphrey
Chetham
,
rushed
up
to
him
.
<EOS>
"You
here
again
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Fawkes
,
angrily
,
and
not
unsuspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
play
the
spy
upon
me?""I
have
watched
for
you
for
the
last
ten
nights
,
"
replied
Chetham
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
not
where
you
were
.
<EOS>
But
I
found
your
boat
here
,
and
I
hoped
you
would
not
cross
the
water
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
all
this
care
?
"
demanded
Fawkes
.
"
<EOS>
Has
aught
<EOS>
happened?—Is
<EOS>
Viviana
safe?—Speak
,
man
!
<EOS>
do
not
keep
me
longer
in
suspense!""Alas
!
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
"
she
is
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Illustration"A
prisoner
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Fawkes
,
in
a
hollow
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Then
my
forebodings
were
not
without
cause
.
<EOS>
""How
has
this
happened
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
who
had
listened
to
what
was
said
in
silent
wonder
.
<EOS>
Chetham
then
hastily
related
all
that
had
taken
place
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
not
what
has
become
of
her
,
"
he
said
,
in
conclusion
;
"
but
I
have
heard
that
she
was
taken
to
the
Star
-
Chamber
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury,—for
<EOS>
he
,
it
appears
,
was
the
companion
of
Topcliffe,—and
,
refusing
to
answer
the
interrogations
of
the
Council
,
was
conveyed
to
the
Tower
,
and
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
subjected
to
the
torture
.
<EOS>
""Tortured
<EOS>
!
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
horror
-
stricken
;
"
Viviana
tortured
!
<EOS>
And
I
have
brought
her
to
this
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God
!
<EOS>
Oh
,
God!""It
is
indeed
an
agonizing
reflection
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
,
in
a
sombre
tone
,
"
and
enough
to
drive
you
to
despair
.
<EOS>
Her
last
wishes
,
expressed
only
in
looks
,
for
she
did
not
dare
to
give
utterance
to
them
,
were
that
I
should
warn
you
not
to
approach
the
house
at
Lambeth
,
your
enemies
being
concealed
within
it
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
fulfilled
them
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"And
<EOS>
he
turned
to
depart
.
<EOS>
"Stay
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Catesby
,
arresting
him
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
Father
Oldcorne?""I
<EOS>
know
not
,
"
replied
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
As
I
have
told
you
,
Viviana
by
some
means
contrived
his
escape
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
,
hurrying
away
,
he
was
lost
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
this
a
troubled
dream
,
or
dread
reality
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Fawkes
to
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
it
is
too
true
,
"
returned
the
other
,
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
Viviana!""Something
must
be
done
to
set
her
free
,
"
cried
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
purchase
her
liberty
by
delivering
up
myself
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
oath
—
remember
your
oath
!
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
destroy
yourself
,
but
not
your
associates
.
<EOS>
""True
—
true
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
distractedly,—"I
do
remember
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sold
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
""Anger
<EOS>
not
Heaven
by
these
idle
lamentations,—and
at
a
time
,
too
,
when
all
is
so
prosperous
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
!
"
cried
Fawkes
,
fiercely
,
"
would
you
have
me
calm
,
when
she
who
called
me
father
,
and
was
dear
to
me
as
a
child
,
is
taken
from
me
by
these
remorseless
butchers,—subjected
to
their
terrible
examinations,—plunged
in
a
dismal
dungeon,—and
stretched
upon
the
rack,—and
<EOS>
all
for
me
—
for
me
!
<EOS>
I
shall
go
mad
if
I
think
upon
it!""You
must
not
think
upon
it
,
"
returned
Catesby,—"at
least
,
not
here
.
<EOS>
We
shall
be
observed
.
<EOS>
Let
us
return
to
the
house
;
and
perhaps
—
though
I
scarcely
dare
indulge
the
hope
—
some
plan
may
be
devised
for
her
liberation
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
dragged
Fawkes
,
who
was
almost
frenzied
with
anguish
,
forcibly
along
,
and
they
returned
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
Nothing
more
was
said
that
night
.
<EOS>
Catesby
judged
it
prudent
to
let
the
first
violence
of
his
friend
's
emotion
expend
itself
before
he
attempted
to
soothe
him
;
and
when
he
communicated
the
sad
event
to
Garnet
,
the
latter
strongly
approved
the
plan
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
greatly
distressed
at
the
intelligence
,
and
his
affliction
was
shared
by
the
other
conspirators
.
<EOS>
No
fears
were
entertained
by
any
of
them
that
Viviana
would
reveal
aught
of
the
plot
,
but
this
circumstance
only
added
to
their
regrets
.
<EOS>
"I
will
stake
my
life
for
her
constancy
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
will
I
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
She
will
die
a
martyr
for
us
.
"He
<EOS>
then
proposed
that
they
should
pray
for
her
deliverance
.
<EOS>
And
all
instantly
assenting
,
they
knelt
down
,
while
Garnet
poured
forth
the
most
earnest
supplications
to
the
Virgin
in
her
behalf
.
<EOS>
The
next
morning
,
Guy
Fawkes
set
forth
,
and
ascertained
that
Humphrey
Chetham
's
statement
was
correct
,
and
that
Viviana
was
indeed
a
prisoner
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
He
repaired
thither
,
and
tried
to
ascertain
in
what
part
of
the
fortress
she
was
confined
,
in
the
hope
of
gaining
admittance
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
could
obtain
no
information
and
his
inquiries
<EOS>
excited
suspicion
<EOS>
,
he
was
compelled
to
return
without
accomplishing
his
object
.
<EOS>
Crossing
Tower
Hill
on
his
way
back
,
he
turned
to
glance
at
the
stern
pile
he
had
just
quitted
,
and
which
was
fraught
with
the
most
fearful
interest
to
him
,
when
he
perceived
Chetham
issue
from
the
Bulwark
Gate
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
made
up
to
him
;
but
the
young
merchant
,
who
had
evidently
seen
him
,
though
he
looked
sedulously
another
way
,
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
river
,
and
was
quickly
lost
to
view
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
the
gloomiest
thoughts
,
Guy
Fawkes
proceeded
to
Westminster
,
where
he
arrived
without
further
adventure
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
In
the
latter
part
of
the
same
day
,
as
the
conspirators
were
conferring
together
,
they
were
alarmed
by
a
knocking
at
the
outer
gate
;
and
sending
Bates
to
reconnoitre
<EOS>
,
he
instantly
returned
with
the
intelligence
that
it
was
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
this
name
,
Tresham
,
who
was
one
of
the
party
,
turned
pale
as
death
,
and
trembled
so
violently
that
he
could
scarcely
support
himself
.
<EOS>
Having
been
allowed
to
go
forth
on
that
day
,
the
visit
of
Lord
Mounteagle
at
this
juncture
,
coupled
with
the
agitation
it
occasioned
him
,
seemed
to
proclaim
him
guilty
of
treachery
for
the
second
time
.
<EOS>
"You
have
betrayed
us
,
villain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
drawing
his
dagger
;
"
but
you
shall
not
escape
.
<EOS>
I
will
poniard
you
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
hope
for
mercy
,
do
not
strike
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
On
my
soul
,
I
have
not
seen
Lord
Mounteagle
,
and
know
not
,
any
more
than
yourselves
,
what
brings
him
hither
.
<EOS>
Put
it
to
the
proof
.
<EOS>
Let
him
come
in
.
<EOS>
Conceal
yourselves
,
and
you
will
hear
what
passes
between
us
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
it
be
so
,
"
interposed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
step
within
this
closet
,
the
door
of
which
shall
remain
ajar
.
<EOS>
From
it
I
can
watch
him
without
being
observed
,
and
if
aught
occurs
to
confirm
our
suspicions
,
he
dies
.
<EOS>
""Bates
<EOS>
shall
station
himself
in
the
passage
,
and
stab
him
if
he
attempts
to
fly
,
"
added
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
sword
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""It
is
here
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
delivering
it
to
Catesby
,
who
handed
it
to
Bates
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
satisfied?""Is
Lord
Mounteagle
alone
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Catesby
,
without
noticing
the
question
.
<EOS>
"He
appears
to
be
so
,
"
replied
Bates
.
<EOS>
"Admit
<EOS>
him
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
closet
with
Keyes
,
he
was
followed
by
Fawkes
,
who
drew
his
dagger
,
and
kept
the
door
slightly
ajar
,
while
Garnet
and
the
rest
retired
to
other
hiding
-
places
.
<EOS>
A
few
moments
afterwards
,
Bates
returned
with
Lord
Mounteagle
,
and
,
having
ushered
him
into
the
room
,
took
his
station
in
the
passage
,
as
directed
by
Catesby
.
<EOS>
The
room
was
very
dark
,
the
shutters
being
closed
,
and
light
only
finding
its
way
through
the
chinks
in
them
;
and
it
appeared
totally
so
to
Lord
Mounteagle
,
who
,
groping
his
way
,
stumbled
forward
,
and
exclaimed
in
accents
of
some
alarm,"Where
<EOS>
am
I
?
<EOS>
Where
is
Mr.
Tresham?""I
am
here
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
advancing
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"
How
did
your
lordship
find
me
out
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
after
the
customary
salutations
were
exchanged
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
servant
saw
you
enter
this
house
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
"
and
,
knowing
I
was
anxious
to
see
you
,
waited
for
some
hours
without
,
in
the
expectation
of
your
coming
forth
.
<EOS>
But
as
this
did
not
occur
,
he
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
me
on
his
return
,
and
I
immediately
came
in
quest
of
you
.
<EOS>
When
I
knocked
at
the
gate
,
I
scarcely
knew
what
to
think
of
the
place
,
and
began
to
fear
you
must
have
fallen
into
the
hands
of
cut
-
throats
;
and
,
now
that
I
have
gained
admittance
,
my
wonder
—
and
I
may
add
my
uneasiness
—
is
not
diminished
.
<EOS>
Why
do
you
hide
yourself
in
this
wretched
place?""Be
seated
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
placing
a
chair
for
Lord
Mounteagle
,
with
his
back
to
the
closet
,
while
he
took
one
opposite
him
,
and
near
a
table
,
on
which
some
papers
were
laid
.
<EOS>
"
Your
lordship
may
remember
,
"
he
continued
,
scarcely
knowing
what
answer
to
make
to
the
question
,
"
that
I
wrote
to
you
some
time
ago
,
to
say
that
a
conspiracy
was
hatching
among
certain
of
our
party
against
the
State
.
<EOS>
""I
have
reason
to
remember
it
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
The
letter
was
laid
before
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
and
inquiries
instituted
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
But
,
owing
to
your
disappearance
,
nothing
could
be
elicited
.
<EOS>
What
plot
had
you
discovered?"At
this
moment
,
Tresham
,
who
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
the
closet
,
perceived
the
door
noiselessly
open
,
and
behind
it
the
figure
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
with
the
dagger
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"I
was
misinformed
as
to
the
nature
of
the
plot
,
"
he
stammered
.
<EOS>
"Was
<EOS>
it
against
the
King
's
life
?
"
demanded
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
rejoined
Tresham
;
"
as
far
as
I
could
learn
,
it
was
an
insurrection
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Mounteagle
,
sceptically
.
<EOS>
"
My
information
,
then
,
differed
from
yours
.
<EOS>
Who
were
the
parties
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
suspected?""As
<EOS>
I
wrongfully
suspected
them
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
evasively
,
"
<EOS>
your
lordship
must
excuse
my
naming
them
.
<EOS>
""Was
<EOS>
Catesby
—
or
Winter
—
or
Wright
—
or
Rookwood
—
or
Sir
Everard
Digby
concerned
in
it
?
"
demanded
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
one
of
them
,
"
asseverated
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"They
are
the
persons
I
suspect
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
;
"
and
they
are
suspected
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
not
told
me
what
you
are
doing
in
this
strange
habitation
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ferreting
out
a
plot
,
or
contriving
one?""Both
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"How
?
"
cried
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"I
am
plotting
for
myself
,
and
counterplotting
the
designs
of
others
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
mysteriously
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
this
place
,
then
,
the
rendezvous
of
a
band
of
conspirators
?
"
asked
Mounteagle
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
Tresham
nodded
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
no
need
of
concealment
with
me
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
this
was
said
,
Tresham
raised
his
eyes
,
and
saw
that
Guy
Fawkes
had
stepped
silently
forward
,
and
placed
himself
behind
Mounteagle
's
chair
.
<EOS>
His
hand
grasped
his
dagger
,
and
his
gaze
never
moved
from
the
object
of
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
they
?
"
<EOS>
repeated
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
Is
Guy
Fawkes
one
of
them?""Assuredly
not
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
Why
should
you
name
him
?
<EOS>
I
never
mentioned
him
to
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
""I
think
you
did
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
certain
you
spoke
of
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
Tresham
's
regards
involuntarily
wandered
to
the
closet
,
when
he
beheld
the
stern
glance
of
the
person
alluded
to
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"You
have
heard
of
Viviana
Radcliffe
's
imprisonment
,
I
suppose
?
"
pursued
Mounteagle
,
unconscious
of
what
was
passing
.
<EOS>
Illustration"I
have
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Earl
of
Salisbury
expected
he
would
be
able
to
wring
all
from
her
,
but
he
has
failed
,
"
observed
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
observed
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
you
were
disposed
to
serve
him
?
"
remarked
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
am
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
if
secrets
are
to
be
revealed
,
I
had
rather
be
the
bearer
of
them
than
any
one
else
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
for
Viviana
.
<EOS>
""I
could
procure
her
liberation
,
if
I
chose
,
"
observed
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"Say
<EOS>
you
so
?
"
cried
Fawkes
,
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
;
<EOS>
"
then
you
stir
not
hence
till
you
have
procured
it!"VII

THE
STAR
-
CHAMBERViviana
,
as
has
already
been
intimated
,
after
her
capture
at
the
house
at
Lambeth
,
was
conveyed
to
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
Here
she
was
detained
until
a
late
hour
on
the
following
day
,
when
she
underwent
a
long
and
rigorous
examination
by
certain
members
of
the
Privy
Council
,
who
were
summoned
for
that
purpose
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
Throughout
this
arduous
trial
she
maintained
the
utmost
composure
,
and
never
for
a
single
moment
lost
her
firmness
.
<EOS>
On
all
occasions
,
her
matchless
beauty
and
dignity
produced
the
strongest
impression
on
the
beholders
;
but
on
no
occasion
had
they
ever
produced
so
strong
an
effect
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
Her
features
were
totally
destitute
of
bloom
,
but
their
very
paleness
,
contrasted
as
it
was
with
her
large
dark
eyes
,
which
blazed
with
unwonted
brilliancy
,
as
well
as
with
her
jet
-
black
hair
,
so
far
from
detracting
from
her
loveliness
,
appeared
to
add
to
it
.
<EOS>
As
she
was
brought
before
the
Council
,
who
were
seated
round
a
table
,
and
remained
standing
at
a
short
distance
from
them
,
guarded
by
Topcliffe
and
two
halberdiers
,
<EOS>
a
murmur
of
admiration
pervaded
the
group,—nor
<EOS>
was
this
feeling
lessened
as
the
examination
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Once
,
when
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
adverted
to
the
unworthy
position
in
which
she
,
the
daughter
of
the
proud
and
loyal
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
had
placed
herself
,
a
shade
passed
over
her
brow
,
and
a
slight
convulsion
agitated
her
frame
.
<EOS>
But
the
next
moment
she
recovered
herself
,
and
said,"However
circumstances
may
appear
against
me
,
and
whatever
opinion
your
lordships
may
entertain
of
my
conduct
,
the
King
has
not
a
more
loyal
subject
than
myself
,
nor
have
any
of
you
made
greater
efforts
to
avert
the
danger
by
which
he
is
threatened
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
admit
that
his
Majesty
is
in
danger
?
"
cried
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
admit
nothing
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
affirm
that
I
am
his
true
and
loyal
subject
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
expect
us
to
believe
your
assertion
,
"
replied
the
Earl
;
"
unless
you
approve
it
by
declaring
all
you
know
touching
this
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
told
you
,
my
lord
,
"
she
returned
,
"
that
my
lips
are
sealed
on
that
subject
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
disclaim
,
then
,
all
knowledge
of
a
plot
against
the
King
's
life
,
and
against
his
government
?
"
pursued
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
Viviana
shook
her
head
.
<EOS>
"You
refuse
to
give
up
the
names
of
your
companions
,
or
to
reveal
their
intentions
?
<EOS>
"
continued
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
,
"
she
answered
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Your
obstinacy
will
not
save
them
,
"
rejoined
the
Earl
,
in
a
severe
tone
,
and
after
a
brief
pause
.
<EOS>
"
Their
names
and
their
atrocious
designs
are
known
to
us
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
such
be
the
case
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
why
interrogate
me
on
the
subject?""Because
—
but
it
is
needless
to
give
a
reason
for
the
course
which
justice
requires
me
to
pursue
,
"
returned
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
implicated
in
this
plot
,
and
nothing
can
save
you
from
condign
punishment
but
a
frank
and
full
confession
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
<EOS>
can
save
me
then
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
but
Heaven
knows
I
shall
perish
unjustly
.
<EOS>
"IllustrationA
consultation
was
then
held
by
the
lords
of
the
council
,
who
whispered
together
for
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Viviana
regarded
them
anxiously
,
but
suffered
no
expression
of
uneasiness
to
escape
her
.
<EOS>
As
they
again
turned
towards
her
,
she
saw
from
their
looks
,
some
of
which
exhibited
great
commiseration
for
her
,
that
they
had
come
to
a
decision
<EOS>
(
she
could
not
doubt
<EOS>
what
)
<EOS>
respecting
her
fate
.
<EOS>
Her
heart
stopped
beating
,
and
she
could
scarcely
support
herself
.
<EOS>
Such
,
however
,
was
the
control
she
exercised
over
herself
that
,
though
filled
with
terror
,
her
demeanour
remained
unaltered
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
long
kept
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
Fixing
his
searching
gaze
upon
her
,
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
observed
in
a
severe
tone,"Viviana
Radcliffe
,
I
ask
you
for
the
last
time
whether
you
will
avow
the
truth?"No
answer
was
returned
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
disguise
from
you
,
"
continued
the
Earl
,
"
that
your
youth
,
your
beauty
,
your
constancy
,
and
,
above
all
,
your
apparent
innocence
,
have
deeply
interested
me
,
as
well
as
the
other
noble
persons
here
assembled
to
interrogate
you
,
and
who
would
willingly
save
you
from
the
sufferings
you
will
necessarily
undergo
,
from
a
mistaken
fidelity
to
the
heinous
traitors
with
whom
you
are
so
unhappily
leagued
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
you
time
to
reflect
<EOS>
did
I
think
the
delay
would
answer
any
good
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
would
remind
you
that
no
oath
of
secresy
,
however
solemn
,
can
be
binding
in
an
unrighteous
cause
.
<EOS>
I
would
tell
you
that
your
first
duty
is
to
your
prince
and
governor
,
and
that
it
is
as
great
<EOS>
a
crime
,
as
unpardonable
in
the
eyes
of
God
as
of
man
,
to
withhold
the
revelation
of
a
conspiracy
against
the
State
,
should
it
come
to
your
knowledge
,
as
to
conspire
against
it
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
would
lay
all
this
before
you
.
<EOS>
I
would
show
you
the
magnitude
of
your
offence
,
the
danger
in
which
you
stand
,
and
the
utter
impossibility
of
screening
your
companions
,
who
,
ere
long
,
will
be
confronted
with
you,—did
<EOS>
I
think
it
would
avail
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
continue
obstinate
,
justice
must
take
its
course
.
<EOS>
""I
am
prepared
for
the
worst
,
<EOS>
my
lord
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
humbly
.
<EOS>
"
I
thank
your
lordship
for
your
consideration
:
but
I
take
you
all
to
witness
that
I
profess
the
utmost
loyalty
and
devotion
for
my
sovereign
,
and
that
,
whatever
may
be
my
fate
,
those
feelings
will
remain
unchanged
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
manner
and
your
words
are
so
sincere
,
that
,
were
not
your
conduct
at
variance
with
them
,
they
might
convince
us
,
"
returned
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
even
if
we
could
credit
your
innocence
,
we
are
bound
to
act
as
if
you
were
guilty
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
committed
to
the
Tower
till
his
Majesty
's
pleasure
is
known
.
<EOS>
And
I
grieve
to
add
,
if
you
still
continue
obstinate
,
the
severest
measures
will
be
resorted
to
,
to
extract
the
truth
from
you
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
concluded
,
he
attached
his
signature
to
a
warrant
which
was
lying
on
the
table
before
him
,
and
traced
a
few
lines
to
Sir
William
Waad
,
lieutenant
of
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
handed
the
papers
to
Topcliffe
,
and
waving
his
hand
,
Viviana
was
removed
to
the
chamber
in
which
she
had
been
previously
confined
,
and
where
she
was
detained
under
a
strict
guard
,
until
Topcliffe
,
who
had
left
her
,
returned
to
say
that
all
was
in
readiness
,
and
bidding
her
follow
him
,
led
the
way
to
the
river
-
side
,
where
a
wherry
,
manned
by
six
rowers
,
was
waiting
for
them
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
profoundly
dark
,
and
,
as
none
of
the
guard
carried
torches
,
their
course
was
steered
in
perfect
obscurity
.
<EOS>
But
the
rowers
were
too
familiar
with
the
river
to
require
the
guidance
of
light
.
<EOS>
Shooting
the
bridge
in
safety
,
and
pausing
only
for
a
moment
to
give
the
signal
of
their
approach
to
the
sentinels
on
the
ramparts
,
they
passed
swiftly
under
the
low
-
browed
arch
of
Traitor
's
Gate
.

THE
JAILER
'S
DAUGHTERAs
Viviana
set
foot
on
those
fatal
stairs
,
which
so
many
have
trod
,
and
none
without
feeling
that
they
took
their
first
step
towards
the
scaffold
,
she
involuntarily
shrank
backward
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
now
too
late
to
retreat
;
and
she
surrendered
her
hand
to
Topcliffe
,
who
assisted
her
up
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Half
-
a
-
dozen
men
-
at
-
arms
,
with
a
like
number
of
warders
bearing
torches
,
were
present
;
and
as
it
was
necessary
that
Topcliffe
should
deliver
his
warrant
into
Sir
William
Waad
's
own
hands
,
he
committed
his
prisoner
to
the
warders
,
with
instructions
to
them
to
take
her
to
the
guard
-
room
near
the
By
-
ward
Tower
,
while
he
proceeded
to
the
lieutenant
's
lodgings
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
first
time
Viviana
had
beheld
the
terrible
pile
in
which
she
was
immured
,
though
she
was
well
acquainted
with
its
history
,
and
with
the
persecutions
which
many
of
the
professors
of
her
faith
had
endured
within
it
during
the
recent
reign
of
Elizabeth
;
and
as
the
light
of
the
torches
flashed
upon
the
grey
walls
of
the
Bloody
Tower
,
and
upon
the
adjoining
ramparts
,
all
the
dreadful
tales
she
had
heard
rushed
to
her
recollection
.
<EOS>
But
having
recovered
the
first
shock
,
the
succeeding
impressions
were
powerless
in
comparison
,
and
she
accompanied
the
warders
to
the
guard
-
room
without
expressing
any
outward
emotion
.
<EOS>
Here
a
seat
was
offered
her
,
and
as
the
men
considerately
withdrew
,
she
was
able
to
pursue
her
reflections
unmolested
.
<EOS>
They
were
sad
enough
,
and
it
required
all
her
firmness
to
support
her
.
<EOS>
When
considering
what
was
likely
to
befal
her
in
consequence
of
her
adherence
to
the
fortunes
of
Fawkes
and
his
companions
,
she
had
often
pictured
some
dreadful
situation
like
the
present
,
but
the
reality
far
exceeded
her
worst
anticipations
.
<EOS>
She
had
deemed
herself
equal
to
any
emergency
,
but
as
she
thought
upon
the
dark
menaces
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
she
felt
it
would
require
greater
fortitude
than
she
had
hitherto
displayed
to
bear
her
through
her
trial
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
her
meditations
entirely
confined
to
herself
.
<EOS>
While
trembling
for
the
perilous
situation
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
she
reproached
herself
that
she
could
not
requite
even
in
thought
the
passionate
devotion
of
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"What
matters
it
now
,
"
she
thought
,
"
that
I
can
not
love
him
?
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
be
nothing
to
him
,
or
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
And
yet
I
feel
I
have
done
him
wrong
,
and
that
I
should
be
happier
if
I
could
requite
his
attachment
.
<EOS>
But
the
die
is
cast
.
<EOS>
It
is
too
late
to
repent
,
or
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
My
heart
acquits
me
of
having
been
influenced
by
any
unworthy
motive
,
and
I
will
strive
to
endure
the
keenest
pang
without
a
murmur
.
<EOS>
"Shortly
<EOS>
after
this
,
Topcliffe
returned
with
Sir
William
Waad
.
<EOS>
On
their
entrance
,
Viviana
arose
,
and
the
lieutenant
eyed
her
with
some
curiosity
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
tall
,
stoutly
-
built
,
and
having
harsh
features
,
stamped
with
an
expression
of
mingled
cunning
and
ferocity
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
had
a
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
look
,
and
were
overshadowed
by
thick
and
scowling
brows
.
<EOS>
Saluting
the
captive
with
affected
courtesy
,
he
<EOS>
observed,"So
<EOS>
you
refuse
to
answer
the
interrogations
of
the
Privy
Council
,
madam
,
I
understand
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
sorry
for
it
,
because
I
would
have
the
merit
of
wringing
the
truth
from
you
.
<EOS>
Those
who
have
been
most
stubborn
outside
these
walls
,
have
been
the
most
yielding
within
them
.
<EOS>
""That
will
not
be
my
case
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
shall
see
,
"
returned
the
lieutenant
,
with
a
significant
glance
at
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
Ordering
her
to
follow
him
,
he
then
proceeded
along
the
ward
in
the
direction
of
the
Bloody
Tower
,
and
passing
beneath
its
arched
gateway
,
ascended
the
steps
on
the
left
,
and
led
her
to
his
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
habitation
,
he
mounted
to
the
upper
story
,
and
tracking
a
long
gallery
,
brought
her
to
a
small
circular
chamber
in
the
Bell
Tower
.
<EOS>
Its
sole
furniture
were
a
chair
,
a
table
,
and
a
couch
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
you
will
remain
for
the
present
,
"
observed
the
lieutenant
,
smiling
grimly
,
and
placing
a
lamp
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
depend
upon
yourself
whether
your
accommodations
are
better
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
quitted
the
cell
with
his
attendants
,
and
barred
the
door
outside
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Viviana
,
who
had
hitherto
restrained
her
anguish
,
suffered
it
to
find
vent
in
tears
.
<EOS>
Never
had
she
felt
so
utterly
forlorn
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
All
before
her
was
threatening
and
terrible
,
full
of
dangers
,
real
and
imaginary
;
nor
could
she
look
back
upon
her
past
career
without
something
like
remorse
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
that
Heaven
would
take
me
to
itself
!
"
<EOS>
she
murmured
,
clasping
her
hands
in
an
agony
of
distress
,
"
for
I
feel
unequal
to
my
trials
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
that
I
had
perished
with
my
dear
father
!
<EOS>
For
what
dreadful
fate
am
I
reserved?—Torture,—I
will
bear
it
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
But
death
by
the
hands
of
the
public
executioner,—it
is
too
horrible
to
think
of
!
<EOS>
Is
there
no
way
to
escape
that?"As
this
hideous
thought
occurred
to
her
,
she
uttered
a
loud
and
prolonged
scream
,
and
fell
senseless
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
When
she
recovered
it
was
daylight
;
and
,
weak
and
exhausted
<EOS>
,
she
crept
to
the
couch
,
and
throwing
herself
upon
it
,
endeavoured
to
forget
her
misery
in
sleep
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
is
usually
the
case
with
the
afflicted
,
it
fled
her
eyelids
,
and
she
passed
several
hours
in
the
severest
mental
torture
,
unrelieved
by
a
single
cheering
thought
.
<EOS>
About
the
middle
of
the
day
,
the
door
of
the
cell
was
opened
by
an
old
woman
with
a
morose
and
forbidding
countenance
,
attended
by
a
younger
female
,
who
resembled
her
in
all
<EOS>
but
the
expression
of
her
features
(
her
look
was
gentle
and
compassionate
)
,
and
who
appeared
to
be
her
daughter
.
<EOS>
Without
paying
any
attention
to
Viviana
,
the
old
woman
took
a
small
loaf
of
bread
and
other
provisions
from
a
basket
she
had
brought
with
her
,
and
placed
them
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
was
about
to
depart
,
<EOS>
when
her
daughter
,
who
had
glanced
uneasily
at
the
couch
,
observed
in
a
kindly
tone,"Shall
we
not
inquire
whether
we
can
be
of
service
to
the
poor
young
lady
,
mother?""Why
should
we
concern
ourselves
about
her
,
Ruth
?
<EOS>
"
returned
the
old
woman
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
If
she
wants
anything
,
she
has
a
tongue
,
and
can
speak
.
<EOS>
If
she
desires
further
comforts
,
"
she
added
,
in
a
significant
tone
,
"
they
must
be
paid
for
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
desire
nothing
but
death
,
"
groaned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
poor
soul
is
dying
,
I
believe
,
"
cried
Ruth
,
rushing
to
the
couch
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
no
cordial
-
water
about
you
<EOS>
,
mother?""Truly
have
I
,
"
returned
the
old
woman
;
"
and
I
have
other
things
besides
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
paid
for
them
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
she
spoke
she
drew
from
her
pocket
a
small
,
square
,
Dutch
-
shaped
bottle
.
<EOS>
"Give
<EOS>
it
me
,
"
cried
Ruth
,
snatching
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
the
young
lady
will
pay
for
it
.
<EOS>
""You
are
very
kind
,
"
said
Viviana
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
no
means
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
""I
knew
it
,
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
it
.
<EOS>
Give
me
back
the
flask
,
Ruth
.
<EOS>
She
shall
not
taste
a
drop
.
<EOS>
Do
you
not
hear
,
she
has
no
money
,
wench
?
<EOS>
Give
it
me
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
""Nay
,
mother
,
for
pity
's
sake
,
"
implored
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"Pity
,
forsooth
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
old
woman
,
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
,
and
thy
father
,
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
had
any
such
feeling
,
it
would
be
high
time
for
him
to
give
up
his
post
of
jailer
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
<EOS>
Pity
for
a
poor
prisoner
!
<EOS>
Thou
a
jailer
's
daughter
,
and
talk
so
.
<EOS>
I
am
ashamed
of
thee
,
wench
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
this
was
a
rich
Catholic
heiress
,
and
had
powerful
and
wealthy
friends
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
she
is
,
"
replied
Ruth
;
"
and
though
she
may
have
no
money
with
her
now
,
she
can
command
any
amount
she
pleases
.
<EOS>
I
heard
Master
Topcliffe
tell
young
Nicholas
Hardesty
,
the
warder
,
<EOS>
so
.
<EOS>
She
is
the
daughter
of
the
late
Sir
William
Radcliffe
,
of
Ordsall
Hall
,
in
Lancashire
,
and
sole
heiress
of
his
vast
estates
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
so
,
sweet
lady
?
<EOS>
"
inquired
the
old
woman
,
stepping
towards
the
couch
.
"
<EOS>
Are
you
truly
Sir
William
Radcliffe
's
daughter?""I
am
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
said
I
require
nothing
from
you
.
<EOS>
Leave
me
.
<EOS>
""No
—
<EOS>
no
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
rejoined
Dame
Ipgreve
,
in
a
whining
tone
,
which
was
infinitely
more
disagreeable
to
Viviana
than
her
previous
harshness
<EOS>
,
"
I
can
not
leave
you
in
this
state
.
<EOS>
Raise
her
head
,
Ruth
,
while
I
pour
a
few
drops
of
the
cordial
down
her
throat
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
taste
it
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
putting
the
flask
aside
.
<EOS>
"You
would
find
it
a
sovereign
restorative
,
"
replied
Dame
Ipgreve
,
with
a
mortified
look
;
"
but
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
urge
you
against
your
inclination
.
<EOS>
The
provisions
I
have
been
obliged
to
bring
you
are
too
coarse
for
a
daintily
-
nurtured
maiden
<EOS>
like
you,—but
you
shall
have
others
presently
.
<EOS>
""It
is
needless
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
leave
me
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
well
,
I
am
going
,
"
rejoined
Dame
Ipgreve
,
hesitating
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
want
to
write
to
any
one
?
<EOS>
I
can
find
means
of
conveying
a
letter
secretly
out
of
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
raising
herself
.
"
<EOS>
And
yet
no
—
no
—
I
dare
not
trust
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
may
,
"
replied
the
avaricious
old
woman,—"provided
<EOS>
you
pay
me
well
.
<EOS>
""I
will
think
of
it
,
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
not
strength
to
write
now
.
<EOS>
""You
must
not
give
way
<EOS>
thus,—indeed
,
you
must
not
,
dear
lady
,
"
said
Ruth
,
in
a
voice
of
great
kindness
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
be
safe
to
leave
you
.
<EOS>
Suffer
me
to
remain
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Willingly
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
most
willingly
.
<EOS>
""Stay
with
her
,
then
,
child
,
"
said
Dame
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
and
prepare
a
nourishing
broth
for
her
.
<EOS>
Take
heed
and
make
a
shrewd
bargain
with
her
for
thy
attendance
,
"
she
added
in
a
hasty
whisper
,
as
she
retired
.
<EOS>
Greatly
relieved
by
the
old
woman
's
departure
,
Viviana
turned
to
Ruth
,
and
thanked
her
in
the
warmest
terms
for
her
kindness
.
<EOS>
A
few
minutes
sufficed
to
convert
the
sympathy
which
these
two
young
persons
evidently
felt
towards
each
other
into
affectionate
regard
,
and
the
jailer
's
daughter
assured
Viviana
,
that
so
long
as
she
should
be
detained
,
she
would
devote
herself
to
her
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
old
woman
had
returned
with
a
mess
of
hot
broth
,
which
she
carried
with
an
air
of
great
mystery
beneath
her
cloak
.
<EOS>
Viviana
was
prevailed
upon
by
the
solicitations
of
Ruth
to
taste
it
,
and
found
herself
much
revived
in
consequence
.
<EOS>
Her
slight
meal
ended
,
Dame
Ipgreve
departed
,
with
a
promise
to
return
in
the
evening
with
such
viands
as
she
could
manage
to
introduce
unobserved
,
and
with
a
flask
of
wine
.
<EOS>
"You
will
need
it
,
sweet
lady
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
"
she
said
;
"
for
my
husband
tells
me
you
are
in
peril
of
the
torture
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
is
a
sad
thing
,
that
such
as
you
should
be
so
cruelly
dealt
with
!
<EOS>
But
we
will
take
all
the
care
of
you
we
can
.
<EOS>
You
will
not
forget
to
requite
us
.
<EOS>
You
must
give
me
an
order
on
your
steward
,
or
on
some
rich
Catholic
friend
.
<EOS>
I
am
<EOS>
half
a
Papist
myself,—that
is
,
I
like
one
religion
as
well
as
the
other,—and
<EOS>
I
like
those
best
,
<EOS>
whatever
their
creed
may
be
,
who
pay
best
.
<EOS>
That
is
my
maxim
:
and
it
is
the
same
with
my
husband
.
<EOS>
We
do
all
we
can
to
scrape
together
a
penny
for
our
child
.
<EOS>
""No
more
of
this
,
<EOS>
good
mother
,
"
interrupted
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
It
distresses
the
lady
!
<EOS>
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
she
wants
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Right
<EOS>
,
child
,
right
,
"
returned
Dame
Ipgreve;—"do
not
forget
what
I
told
you
,
"
she
added
in
a
whisper
.
<EOS>
And
she
quitted
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Ruth
remained
with
Viviana
during
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
it
was
a
great
consolation
to
the
latter
to
find
that
her
companion
was
of
the
same
faith
as
herself,—having
been
converted
by
Father
Poole
,
a
Romish
priest
who
was
confined
in
the
Tower
during
the
latter
part
of
Elizabeth
's
reign
,
and
whose
sufferings
and
constancy
for
his
religion
had
made
a
powerful
impression
on
the
jailer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Viviana
ascertained
this
,
she
made
Ruth
,
so
far
as
she
thought
prudent
,
a
confidante
in
her
misfortunes
,
and
after
beguiling
some
hours
in
conversation
,
they
both
knelt
down
and
offered
up
fervent
prayers
to
the
Virgin
.
<EOS>
Ruth
then
departed
,
promising
to
return
in
the
evening
with
her
mother
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
it
became
dark
,
Dame
Ipgreve
and
her
daughter
reappeared
,
the
former
carrying
a
lamp
,
and
the
latter
a
basket
of
provisions
.
<EOS>
Ruth
's
countenance
was
so
troubled
,
that
Viviana
was
certain
that
some
fresh
calamity
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
she
hastily
demanded
.
<EOS>
"Make
your
meal
first
,
dear
young
lady
,
"
replied
Dame
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
Our
news
might
take
away
your
appetite
,
and
you
will
have
to
pay
for
your
supper
,
whether
you
eat
it
or
not
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
alarm
me
greatly
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
anxiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
ill
news
<EOS>
do
you
bring?""I
will
not
keep
you
longer
in
suspense
,
madam
,
"
said
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
to
be
examined
to
-
night
by
the
lieutenant
and
certain
members
of
the
Privy
Council
,
and
if
you
refuse
to
answer
their
questions
,
I
lament
to
say
you
will
be
put
to
the
torture
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
give
me
strength
to
endure
it
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Viviana
,
in
a
despairing
tone
.
"Eat
,
madam
,
eat
,
"
cried
Dame
Ipgreve
,
pressing
the
viands
upon
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
never
be
able
to
go
through
with
the
examination
,
if
you
starve
yourself
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
sure
,
"
inquired
Viviana
,
appealing
to
Ruth
,
"
that
it
will
take
place
so
soon?""Quite
sure
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
My
father
has
orders
to
attend
the
lieutenant
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
advise
you
to
conceal
nothing
,
"
insinuated
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
determined
to
wring
the
truth
from
you,—and
they
will
do
so
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
good
woman
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
die
before
I
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
""You
think
so
now
,
"
returned
Dame
Ipgreve
,
maliciously
.
"
<EOS>
But
the
sight
of
the
rack
and
the
thumbscrews
will
alter
your
tone
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
support
nature
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
as
I
do
not
desire
to
live
,
I
will
use
no
effort
to
sustain
myself
.
<EOS>
They
may
kill
me
if
they
please
.
<EOS>
""Misfortune
has
turned
her
brain
,
"
muttered
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
take
care
and
secure
my
dues
.
<EOS>
Well
,
madam
,
if
you
will
not
eat
the
supper
I
have
provided
,
it
can
not
be
helped
.
<EOS>
I
must
find
some
one
who
will
.
<EOS>
You
must
pay
for
it
all
the
same
.
<EOS>
My
husband
,
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
will
be
present
at
your
interrogation
,
and
I
am
sure
,
for
my
sake
,
he
will
use
you
as
lightly
as
he
can
.
<EOS>
Come
,
Ruth
,
you
must
not
remain
here
longer
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
let
her
stay
with
me
,
"
implored
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
it
well
worth
your
while
to
grant
me
the
indulgence
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
will
you
give
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
But
no
—
no
—
I
dare
not
leave
her
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
may
visit
you
,
and
find
her
,
and
then
I
should
lose
my
place
.
<EOS>
Come
along
,
Ruth
.
<EOS>
She
shall
attend
you
after
the
interrogation
,
madam
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
there
myself
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
madam
,
"
sobbed
Ruth
,
who
was
almost
drowned
in
tears
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
you
constancy
to
endure
your
trial!""Be
ruled
by
me
,
"
said
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
Speak
out
,
and
secure
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
"She
would
have
continued
in
the
same
strain
,
but
Ruth
dragged
her
away
.
<EOS>
And
casting
a
commiserating
glance
at
Viviana
,
she
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
dreadful
interval
between
their
departure
and
midnight
was
passed
by
Viviana
in
fervent
prayer
.
<EOS>
As
she
heard
through
the
barred
embrasure
of
her
dungeon
the
deep
strokes
of
the
clock
toll
out
the
hour
of
twelve
,
the
door
opened
,
and
a
tall
,
gaunt
personage
,
habited
in
a
suit
of
rusty
black
,
and
with
a
large
bunch
of
keys
at
his
girdle
,
entered
the
cell
.
<EOS>
"You
are
Jasper
Ipgreve
?
"
said
Viviana
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"Right
,
"
replied
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
take
you
before
the
lieutenant
and
the
council
.
<EOS>
Are
you
ready?"Viviana
replied
in
the
affirmative
,
and
Ipgreve
quitting
the
cell
,
outside
which
two
other
officials
in
sable
habiliments
were
stationed
,
led
the
way
down
a
short
spiral
staircase
,
which
brought
them
to
a
narrow
vaulted
passage
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
it
for
some
time
,
the
jailer
halted
before
a
strong
door
,
cased
with
iron
,
and
opening
it
,
admitted
the
captive
into
a
square
chamber
,
the
roof
of
which
was
supported
by
a
heavy
stone
pillar
,
while
its
walls
were
garnished
with
implements
of
torture
.
<EOS>
At
a
table
on
the
left
sat
the
lieutenant
and
three
other
grave
-
looking
personages
.
<EOS>
Across
the
lower
end
of
the
chamber
a
thick
black
curtain
was
stretched
,
hiding
a
deep
recess
;
and
behind
it
,
as
was
evident
from
the
glimmer
that
escaped
from
its
folds
,
there
was
a
light
.
<EOS>
Certain
indistinct
,
but
ominous
sounds
,
issuing
from
the
recess
,
proved
that
there
were
persons
within
it
,
and
Viviana
's
quaking
heart
told
her
what
was
the
nature
of
their
proceedings
.
<EOS>
She
had
ample
time
to
survey
this
dismal
apartment
and
its
occupants
,
for
several
minutes
elapsed
before
a
word
was
addressed
to
her
by
her
interrogators
,
who
continued
to
confer
together
in
an
under
tone
,
as
if
unconscious
of
her
presence
.
<EOS>
During
this
pause
,
broken
only
by
the
ominous
sounds
before
mentioned
,
Viviana
scanned
the
countenances
of
the
group
at
the
table
,
in
the
hope
of
discerning
in
them
some
glimpses
of
compassion
;
but
they
were
inscrutable
and
inexorable
,
and
scarcely
less
dreadful
to
look
upon
than
the
hideous
implements
on
the
walls
.
<EOS>
Viviana
wished
the
earth
would
open
and
swallow
her
,
that
she
might
escape
from
them
.
<EOS>
Anything
was
better
than
to
be
left
at
the
mercy
of
such
men
.
<EOS>
At
certain
times
,
and
not
unfrequently
at
the
most
awful
moments
,
a
double
current
of
thought
will
flow
through
the
brain
,
and
at
this
frightful
juncture
it
was
so
with
Viviana
.
<EOS>
While
shuddering
at
all
she
saw
around
her
,
nay
,
dwelling
upon
it
,
another
and
distinct
train
of
thought
<EOS>
led
her
back
to
former
scenes
of
happiness
,
when
she
was
undisturbed
by
any
but
remote
apprehensions
of
danger
.
<EOS>
She
thought
of
her
tranquil
residence
at
Ordsall,—of
the
flowers
she
had
tended
in
the
garden,—of
her
father
,
and
of
his
affection
for
her,—of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
and
of
her
early
and
scarce
-
acknowledged
attachment
to
him,—and
of
his
generosity
and
devotion
,
and
how
she
had
requited
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
like
a
sullen
cloud
darkening
the
fair
prospect
,
arose
the
figure
of
Guy
Fawkes
—
the
sombre
enthusiast
—
who
had
unwittingly
exercised
such
a
baneful
influence
upon
her
fortunes
.
<EOS>
"Had
<EOS>
he
not
crossed
my
path
,
"
she
mentally
ejaculated
,
"
I
might
have
been
happy
—
might
have
loved
Humphrey
Chetham
—
might
,
perhaps
,
have
wedded
him!"These
<EOS>
reflections
were
suddenly
dispersed
by
the
lieutenant
,
who
,
in
a
stern
tone
,
commenced
his
interrogations
.
<EOS>
As
upon
her
previous
examination
,
Viviana
observed
the
utmost
caution
,
and
either
refused
to
speak
,
or
answered
such
questions
only
as
affected
herself
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
,
she
trembled
violently
,
and
her
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
her
mouth
.
<EOS>
But
after
a
while
,
she
recovered
her
courage
,
and
regarded
the
lieutenant
with
a
look
as
determined
as
his
own
.
<EOS>
"It
is
useless
to
urge
me
farther
,
"
she
concluded
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
said
all
I
will
say
.
<EOS>
""Is
it
<EOS>
your
pleasure
,
my
lords
<EOS>
,
"
observed
Sir
William
Waad
to
the
others
,
"
to
prolong
the
examination?"His
companions
replied
in
the
negative
,
and
the
one
nearest
him
remarked
,
"
Is
she
aware
what
will
follow?""I
am
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
resolutely
,
"
and
I
am
not
to
be
intimidated
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
William
Waad
then
made
a
sign
to
Ipgreve
,
who
immediately
stepped
forward
and
seized
her
arm
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
be
taken
to
that
recess
,
"
said
the
lieutenant
,
"
where
the
question
will
be
put
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
we
shall
remain
here
,
you
have
only
to
utter
a
cry
if
you
are
willing
to
avow
the
truth
,
and
the
torture
shall
be
stayed
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
our
merciful
hope
that
this
may
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
"Summoning
<EOS>
up
all
her
resolution
,
and
walking
with
a
firm
footstep
,
Viviana
passed
with
Ipgreve
behind
the
curtain
.
<EOS>
She
there
beheld
two
men
and
a
woman
—
the
latter
was
the
jailer
's
wife
,
who
instantly
advanced
to
her
,
and
besought
her
to
confess
.
<EOS>
"There
is
no
help
for
it
,
if
you
refuse
,
"
she
urged
;
"
not
all
your
wealth
can
save
you
.
<EOS>
""Mind
<EOS>
your
own
business
,
dame
,
"
interposed
Ipgreve
,
angrily
,
"
and
assist
her
to
unrobe
.
<EOS>
"Saying
<EOS>
this
,
he
stepped
aside
with
the
two
men
,
one
of
whom
was
the
chirurgeon
,
and
the
other
the
tormentor
,
while
Dame
Ipgreve
helped
to
take
off
Viviana
's
gown
.
<EOS>
She
then
tied
a
scarf
over
her
shoulders
,
and
informed
her
husband
she
was
ready
.
<EOS>
The
recess
was
about
twelve
feet
high
,
and
ten
wide
.
<EOS>
It
was
crossed
near
the
roof
,
which
was
arched
and
vaulted
,
by
a
heavy
beam
,
with
pulleys
and
ropes
at
either
extremity
.
<EOS>
But
what
chiefly
attracted
the
unfortunate
captive
's
attention
was
a
couple
of
iron
gauntlets
attached
to
it
,
about
a
yard
apart
.
<EOS>
Upon
the
ground
under
the
beam
,
and
immediately
beneath
that
part
of
it
where
the
gauntlets
were
fixed
,
were
laid
three
pieces
of
wood
,
of
a
few
inches
in
thickness
,
and
piled
one
upon
another
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
must
I
do
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Viviana
,
in
a
hollow
voice
,
but
with
unaltered
resolution
,
of
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"Step
upon
those
pieces
of
wood
,
"
replied
Dame
Ipgreve
,
leading
her
towards
them
.
<EOS>
Viviana
obeyed
,
and
as
soon
as
she
had
set
foot
upon
the
pile
,
the
tormentor
placed
a
joint
-
stool
beside
her
,
and
mounting
it
,
desired
her
to
place
her
right
hand
in
one
of
the
gauntlets
.
<EOS>
She
did
so
,
and
the
tormentor
then
turned
a
screw
,
which
compressed
the
iron
glove
so
tightly
as
to
give
her
excruciating
pain
.
<EOS>
He
then
got
down
,
and
Ipgreve
demanded
if
he
should
proceed
.
<EOS>
A
short
pause
ensued
;
but
,
notwithstanding
her
agony
,
Viviana
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
tormentor
then
placed
the
stool
on
the
left
side
,
and
fastened
the
hand
which
was
still
at
liberty
within
the
other
gauntlet
.
<EOS>
The
torture
was
dreadful
—
and
the
fingers
appeared
crushed
by
the
pressure
.
<EOS>
Still
Viviana
uttered
no
cry
.
<EOS>
After
another
short
pause
,
Ipgreve
said,"You
had
better
let
us
stop
here
.
<EOS>
This
is
mere
child
's
play
compared
with
what
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
answer
being
returned
,
the
tormentor
took
a
mallet
and
struck
one
of
the
pieces
of
wood
from
under
Viviana
's
feet
.
<EOS>
The
shock
was
dreadful
,
and
seemed
to
dislocate
her
wrists
,
while
the
pressure
on
the
hands
was
increased
in
a
tenfold
degree
.
<EOS>
The
poor
sufferer
,
who
was
resting
on
the
points
of
her
feet
,
felt
that
the
removal
of
the
next
piece
of
wood
would
occasion
almost
intolerable
torture
.
<EOS>
Her
constancy
,
however
,
did
not
desert
her
,
and
,
after
the
question
had
been
repeated
by
Ipgreve
,
the
second
block
was
struck
away
.
<EOS>
She
was
now
suspended
by
her
hands
,
and
the
pain
was
so
exquisite
,
that
nature
gave
way
,
and
uttering
a
piercing
scream
,
she
fainted
.
<EOS>
On
recovering
,
she
found
herself
stretched
upon
a
miserable
pallet
,
with
Ruth
watching
beside
her
.
<EOS>
A
glance
round
the
chamber
,
which
was
of
solid
stone
masonry
,
with
a
deep
embrasure
on
one
side
,
convinced
her
that
she
had
been
removed
to
some
other
prison
.
"Where
<EOS>
am
I
?
"
<EOS>
she
asked
,
in
a
faint
voice
.
"In
<EOS>
the
Well
Tower
,
madam
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Ruth
:
"
one
of
the
fortifications
near
the
moat
,
and
now
used
as
a
prison
-
lodging
.
<EOS>
My
father
dwells
within
it
,
and
you
are
under
his
custody
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
father
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
shuddering
as
she
recalled
the
sufferings
she
had
recently
undergone
.
"
<EOS>
Will
he
torture
me
<EOS>
again?""Not
if
I
can
prevent
it
,
dear
lady
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
"
<EOS>
But
hush
!
<EOS>
here
comes
my
mother
.
<EOS>
Not
a
word
before
her
.
"As
<EOS>
Ruth
spoke
,
Dame
Ipgreve
,
who
had
been
lingering
at
the
door
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
She
affected
the
greatest
solicitude
for
Viviana
—
felt
her
pulse
—
looked
at
the
bandages
fastened
round
her
swollen
and
crippled
fingers
,
and
concluded
by
counselling
her
not
to
persist
in
refusing
to
speak
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
dare
not
tell
you
what
tortures
are
in
store
for
you
,
"
she
said
,
"
if
you
continue
thus
obstinate
.
<EOS>
But
they
will
be
a
thousand
times
worse
than
what
you
endured
last
night
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
will
my
next
interrogation
take
place
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"A
week
hence
,
it
may
be,—or
<EOS>
it
may
be
sooner
,
"
returned
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
"
It
depends
upon
the
state
you
are
in
—
and
somewhat
upon
the
fees
you
give
my
husband
,
for
he
has
a
voice
with
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
""I
would
give
him
all
I
possess
,
if
he
could
save
me
from
further
torture
,
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
alas
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Dame
Ipgreve
,
"
you
ask
more
than
can
be
done
.
<EOS>
He
would
save
you
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
not
let
him
.
<EOS>
However
,
we
will
do
all
we
can
to
mitigate
your
sufferings
—
all
we
can
—
provided
you
pay
us
.
<EOS>
Stay
with
her
,
child
,
"
she
added
,
with
a
significant
gesture
to
her
daughter
,
as
she
quitted
the
room
,
"
stay
with
her
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
heart
bleeds
for
you
,
madam
,
"
said
Ruth
,
in
accents
of
the
deepest
commiseration
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
depend
upon
my
fidelity
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
contrive
your
escape
,
I
will,—at
any
risk
to
myself
.
<EOS>
""On
no
account
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
concern
yourself
about
me
more
.
<EOS>
My
earthly
sufferings
,
I
feel
,
will
have
terminated
before
further
cruelty
can
be
practised
upon
me
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
say
not
so
<EOS>
,
madam
,
"
returned
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
—
<EOS>
nay
,
I
am
sure
you
will
live
long
and
happily
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
shook
her
head
,
and
Ruth
,
finding
her
very
feeble
,
thought
it
better
not
to
continue
the
conversation
.
<EOS>
She
accordingly
applied
such
restoratives
as
were
at
hand
,
and
observing
that
the
eyes
of
the
sufferer
closed
as
if
in
slumber
,
glided
noiselessly
out
of
the
chamber
,
and
left
her
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
a
week
passed
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
that
time
,
the
chirurgeon
pronounced
her
in
so
precarious
a
state
,
that
if
the
torture
were
repeated
he
would
not
answer
for
her
life
.
<EOS>
The
interrogation
,
therefore
,
was
postponed
for
a
few
days
,
during
which
the
chirurgeon
constantly
visited
her
,
and
by
his
care
,
and
the
restoratives
she
was
compelled
to
take
,
she
rapidly
regained
her
strength
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
after
the
chirurgeon
had
departed
,
Ruth
cautiously
closed
the
door
,
and
observed
to
her,"You
are
now
so
far
recovered
,
madam
,
as
to
be
able
to
make
an
attempt
to
escape
.
<EOS>
I
have
devised
a
plan
,
which
I
will
communicate
to
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
It
must
not
be
delayed
,
or
you
will
have
to
encounter
a
second
and
more
dreadful
examination
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
attempt
it
if
you
are
exposed
to
risk
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Heed
me
not
,
"
returned
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
One
of
your
friends
has
found
out
your
place
of
confinement
,
and
has
spoken
to
me
about
you
.
<EOS>
""What
friend
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
starting
.
"
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes?—I
mean
—
—
"
And
she
hesitated
,
while
her
pale
cheeks
were
suffused
with
blushes
.
<EOS>
"He
is
named
Humphrey
Chetham
,
"
returned
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
Like
myself
,
he
would
risk
his
life
to
preserve
you
.
<EOS>
""Tell
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
he
must
not
do
so
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
eagerly
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
done
enough
—
too
much
for
me
already
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
expose
him
to
further
hazard
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
so
,
and
entreat
him
to
abandon
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
shall
not
see
him
,
dear
lady
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
if
I
read
him
rightly
,
he
is
not
likely
to
be
turned
aside
by
any
selfish
consideration
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
he
is
not
,
"
groaned
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
But
this
only
adds
to
my
affliction
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
should
see
him
,
dear
Ruth
,
try
to
dissuade
him
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
""I
will
obey
you
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
jailer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
I
am
well
assured
it
will
be
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
some
further
conversation
,
Ruth
retired
,
and
Viviana
was
left
alone
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
Except
the
slumber
procured
by
soporific
potions
,
she
had
known
no
repose
since
she
had
been
confined
within
the
Tower
;
and
this
night
she
felt
more
than
usually
restless
.
<EOS>
After
ineffectually
endeavouring
to
compose
herself
,
she
arose
,
and
hastily
robing
herself
—
a
task
she
performed
with
no
little
difficulty
,
her
fingers
being
almost
useless
—
<EOS>
continued
to
pace
her
narrow
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
mentioned
that
on
one
side
of
the
cell
there
was
a
deep
embrasure
.
<EOS>
It
was
terminated
by
a
narrow
and
strongly
-
grated
loophole
,
looking
upon
the
moat
.
<EOS>
Pausing
before
it
,
Viviana
gazed
forth
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
pitchy
dark
,
and
not
even
a
solitary
star
could
be
discerned
;
but
as
she
had
no
light
in
her
chamber
,
the
gloom
outside
was
less
profound
than
that
within
.
<EOS>
While
standing
thus
,
buried
in
thought
,
and
longing
for
daybreak
,
Viviana
fancied
she
heard
a
slight
sound
as
of
some
one
swimming
across
the
moat
.
<EOS>
Thinking
she
might
be
deceived
,
she
listened
more
intently
,
and
as
the
sound
continued
,
she
felt
sure
she
was
right
in
her
conjecture
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
the
thought
of
Humphrey
Chetham
flashed
upon
her
,
and
she
had
no
doubt
it
must
be
him
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
she
wrong
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
a
noise
was
heard
as
of
some
one
clambering
up
the
wall
;
a
hand
grasped
the
bars
of
the
loophole
,
which
was
only
two
or
three
feet
above
the
level
of
the
water
;
and
a
low
voice
,
which
she
instantly
recognised
,
pronounced
her
name
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
Humphrey
Chetham
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
,
advancing
as
near
as
she
could
to
the
loophole
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"
Do
not
despair
.
<EOS>
I
will
accomplish
your
liberation
.
<EOS>
I
have
passed
three
days
within
the
Tower
,
and
only
ascertained
your
place
of
confinement
a
few
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
I
have
contrived
a
plan
for
your
escape
,
with
the
jailer
's
daughter
,
which
she
will
make
known
to
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
thank
you
sufficiently
for
your
devotion
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
in
accents
of
the
deepest
gratitude
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
implore
you
to
leave
me
to
my
fate
.
<EOS>
I
am
wretched
enough
now
,
Heaven
knows
,
but
if
aught
should
happen
to
you
,
I
shall
be
infinitely
more
so
.
<EOS>
If
I
possess
any
power
over
you,—and
that
I
do
so
,
I
well
<EOS>
know,—I
entreat
,
nay
<EOS>
,
I
command
,
you
to
desist
from
this
attempt
.
<EOS>
""I
have
never
yet
disobeyed
you
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
,
passionately—"nor
<EOS>
will
I
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
bid
me
abandon
you
,
I
will
plunge
into
this
moat
,
never
to
rise
again
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
manner
,
notwithstanding
the
low
tone
in
which
he
spoke
,
was
so
determined
,
that
Viviana
felt
certain
he
would
carry
his
threat
into
execution
;
she
therefore
rejoined
in
a
mournful
tone,"Well
,
be
it
as
you
will
.
<EOS>
It
is
in
vain
to
resist
our
fate
,
I
am
destined
to
bring
misfortune
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
can
save
you
,
I
would
rather
die
than
live
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
's
daughter
will
explain
her
plan
to
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
to
accede
to
it
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
<EOS>
reluctantly
assented
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
quit
the
Tower
at
daybreak
,
"
pursued
Chetham
;
"
and
when
you
are
once
out
of
it
,
hasten
to
the
stairs
beyond
the
wharf
at
Petty
Wales
.
<EOS>
I
will
be
there
with
a
boat
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
let
himself
drop
into
the
water
,
but
his
foot
slipping
,
the
plunge
was
louder
than
he
intended
,
and
attracted
the
attention
of
a
sentinel
on
the
ramparts
,
who
immediately
called
out
to
know
what
was
the
matter
,
and
not
receiving
any
answer
,
discharged
his
caliver
in
the
direction
of
the
sound
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
who
heard
the
challenge
and
the
shot
,
uttered
a
loud
scream
,
and
the
next
moment
Ipgreve
and
his
wife
appeared
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
glanced
suspiciously
round
the
room
;
but
after
satisfying
himself
that
all
was
right
,
and
putting
some
questions
to
the
captive
,
which
she
refused
to
answer
,
he
departed
with
his
wife
,
and
carefully
barred
the
door
.
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
imagine
greater
misery
than
Viviana
endured
the
whole
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
The
uncertainty
in
which
she
was
kept
as
to
Chetham
's
fate
was
almost
insupportable
,
and
the
bodily
pain
she
had
recently
endured
appeared
light
when
compared
with
her
present
mental
torture
.
<EOS>
Day
at
length
dawned
;
but
it
brought
with
it
no
Ruth
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
this
faithful
friend
,
Dame
Ipgreve
entered
the
chamber
with
the
morning
meal
,
and
her
looks
were
so
morose
and
distrustful
,
that
Viviana
feared
she
must
have
discovered
her
daughter
's
design
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
venture
to
make
a
remark
,
but
suffered
the
old
woman
to
depart
in
silence
.
<EOS>
Giving
up
all
for
lost
,
and
concluding
that
Humphrey
Chetham
had
either
perished
,
or
was
,
like
herself
,
a
prisoner
,
Viviana
bitterly
bewailed
his
fate
,
and
reproached
herself
with
being
unintentionally
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
Later
in
the
day
,
Ruth
entered
the
cell
.
<EOS>
To
Viviana
's
eager
inquiries
she
replied
,
that
Humphrey
Chetham
had
escaped
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
the
darkness
,
the
sentinel
had
missed
his
aim
,
and
although
the
most
rigorous
search
was
instituted
throughout
the
fortress
,
he
had
contrived
to
elude
observation
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
attempt
,
"
pursued
Ruth
,
"
must
be
made
this
evening
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
has
informed
my
father
that
you
are
to
be
interrogated
at
midnight
,
the
chirurgeon
having
declared
that
you
are
sufficiently
recovered
to
undergo
the
torture
(
if
needful
)
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
Now
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
The
occurrence
of
last
night
has
made
my
mother
suspicious
,
and
she
watches
my
proceedings
with
a
jealous
eye
.
<EOS>
She
is
at
this
moment
with
a
female
prisoner
in
the
Beauchamp
Tower
,
or
I
should
not
be
able
to
visit
you
.
<EOS>
She
has
consented
,
however
,
to
let
me
bring
in
your
supper
.
<EOS>
You
must
then
change
dresses
with
me
.
<EOS>
Being
about
my
height
,
you
may
easily
pass
for
me
,
and
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
there
is
no
light
below
,
so
that
your
features
will
not
be
distinguished
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
would
have
checked
her
,
but
the
other
would
not
be
interrupted
.
<EOS>
"As
soon
as
you
are
ready
,
"
she
continued
,
"
you
must
lock
the
door
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
must
then
descend
the
short
flight
of
steps
before
you
,
and
pass
as
quickly
as
you
can
through
the
room
where
you
will
see
my
father
and
mother
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
you
are
out
of
the
door
,
turn
to
the
left
,
and
go
straight
forward
to
the
By
-
ward
Tower
.
<EOS>
Show
this
pass
to
the
warders
.
<EOS>
It
is
made
out
in
my
name
,
and
they
will
suffer
you
to
go
forth
.
<EOS>
Do
the
same
with
the
warders
at
the
next
gate,—the
Middle
Tower,—and
again
at
the
Bulwark
Gate
.
<EOS>
That
passed
,
you
are
free
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
you
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Viviana
,
with
a
bewildered
look
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
mind
me
,
"
rejoined
Ruth
:
"
<EOS>
I
shall
be
sufficiently
rewarded
if
I
save
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
farewell
.
<EOS>
Be
ready
at
the
time
appointed
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
consent
,
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
have
no
choice
,
"
replied
Ruth
,
breaking
from
her
,
and
hurrying
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Time
,
as
it
ever
does
,
when
expectation
is
on
the
rack
,
appeared
to
pass
with
unusual
slowness
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
hour
at
length
drew
near
,
Viviana
wished
it
farther
off
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
the
utmost
trepidation
that
she
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
,
and
beheld
Ruth
enter
the
cell
with
the
evening
meal
.
<EOS>
Closing
the
door
,
and
setting
down
the
provisions
,
the
jailer
's
daughter
hastily
divested
herself
of
her
dress
,
which
was
of
brown
serge
,
as
well
as
of
her
coif
and
kerchief
,
while
Viviana
imitated
her
example
.
<EOS>
Without
pausing
to
attire
herself
in
the
other
's
garments
,
Ruth
then
assisted
Viviana
to
put
on
the
dress
she
had
just
laid
aside
,
and
arranged
her
hair
and
the
head
-
gear
<EOS>
so
skilfully
,
that
the
disguise
was
complete
.
<EOS>
Hastily
whispering
some
further
instructions
to
her
,
and
explaining
certain
peculiarities
in
her
gait
and
deportment
,
she
then
pressed
her
to
her
bosom
,
and
led
her
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Viviana
would
have
remonstrated
,
but
Ruth
pushed
her
through
it
,
and
closed
it
.
<EOS>
There
was
now
no
help
,
so
Viviana
,
though
with
great
pain
to
herself
,
contrived
to
turn
the
key
in
the
lock
.
<EOS>
Descending
the
steps
,
she
found
herself
in
a
small
circular
chamber
,
in
which
Ipgreve
and
his
wife
were
seated
at
a
table
,
discussing
their
evening
meal
.
<EOS>
The
sole
light
was
afforded
by
a
few
dying
embers
on
the
hearth
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
has
she
done
,
already
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
old
woman
,
as
Viviana
appeared
.
<EOS>
"
Why
hast
thou
not
brought
the
jelly
with
thee
,
if
she
has
not
eaten
it
all
,
and
those
cates
,
which
Master
Pilchard
,
the
chirurgeon
,
ordered
her
?
<EOS>
Go
and
fetch
them
directly
.
<EOS>
They
will
finish
our
repast
daintily
;
and
there
are
other
matters
too
,
<EOS>
which
I
dare
say
she
has
not
touched
.
<EOS>
She
will
pay
for
them
,
and
that
will
make
them
the
sweeter
.
<EOS>
Go
back
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
What
dost
thou
stand
there
for
,
as
if
thou
wert
thunderstruck
?
<EOS>
Dost
hear
me
,
or
not?""Let
the
wench
alone
,
dame
,
"
growled
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
You
frighten
her
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
mean
to
do
,
"
replied
the
old
woman
;
"
she
deserves
to
be
frightened
.
<EOS>
Hark
thee
,
girl
,
we
must
get
an
order
from
her
on
some
wealthy
Catholic
family
without
delay
—
for
I
do
n't
think
she
will
stand
the
trial
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Ipgreve
,
"
especially
as
she
is
to
be
placed
on
the
rack
.
<EOS>
""She
has
a
chain
of
gold
round
her
throat
<EOS>
,
I
have
observed
,
"
said
the
old
woman
;
"
we
must
get
that
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
it
,
"
said
Viviana
,
in
a
low
tone
,
and
imitating
as
well
as
she
could
the
accents
of
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
Here
it
is
.
<EOS>
""Did
<EOS>
she
give
it
thee
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
old
woman
,
getting
up
,
and
grasping
Viviana
's
lacerated
fingers
with
such
force
,
that
she
had
difficulty
in
repressing
a
scream
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did
she
give
it
thee
,
I
say?""She
gave
it
me
for
you
,
"
gasped
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Take
it
.
"While
<EOS>
the
old
woman
held
the
chain
to
the
fire
,
and
called
to
her
husband
to
light
a
lamp
,
that
she
might
feast
her
greedy
eyes
upon
it
,
Viviana
flew
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
Just
as
she
reached
it
,
the
shrill
voice
of
Dame
Ipgreve
arrested
her
.
<EOS>
"Come
back
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
dame
.
"
<EOS>
Whither
art
thou
going
at
this
time
of
night
?
<EOS>
I
will
not
have
thee
stir
forth
.
<EOS>
Come
back
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
let
her
go
,
"
interposed
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
hath
an
appointment
on
the
Green
with
young
Nicholas
Hardesty
,
the
warder
.
<EOS>
Go
,
wench
.
<EOS>
Be
careful
of
thyself
,
and
return
within
the
hour
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
she
does
not
,
she
will
rue
it
,
"
added
the
dame
.
<EOS>
"
Go
,
then
,
and
I
will
see
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
<EOS>
required
no
further
permission
.
<EOS>
Starting
off
as
she
had
been
directed
on
the
left
,
she
ran
as
fast
as
her
feet
could
carry
her
;
and
,
passing
between
two
arched
gateways
,
soon
reached
the
By
-
ward
Tower
.
<EOS>
Showing
the
pass
to
the
warder
,
he
chucked
her
under
the
chin
,
and
,
drawing
an
immense
bolt
,
opened
the
wicket
,
and
gallantly
helped
her
to
pass
through
it
.
<EOS>
The
like
good
success
attended
her
at
the
Middle
Tower
,
and
at
the
Bulwark
Gate
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
able
to
credit
her
senses
,
and
doubting
whether
she
was
indeed
free
,
she
hurried
on
till
she
came
to
the
opening
leading
to
the
stairs
at
Petty
Wales
.
<EOS>
As
she
hesitated
,
uncertain
what
to
do
,
a
man
advanced
towards
and
addressed
her
by
name
.
<EOS>
It
was
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
emotion
,
Viviana
sank
into
his
arms
,
and
in
another
moment
she
was
placed
in
a
wherry
,
which
was
ordered
to
be
rowed
towards
Westminster
.

<EOS>
—
THE
COUNTERPLOTStartled
,
but
not
dismayed
<EOS>
—
for
he
was
a
man
of
great
courage
—
by
the
sudden
address
and
appearance
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
Lord
Mounteagle
instantly
sprang
to
his
feet
,
and
drawing
his
sword
,
put
himself
into
a
posture
of
defence
.
<EOS>
"You
have
betrayed
me
,
"
he
cried
,
seizing
Tresham
with
his
left
hand
;
"
but
if
I
fall
,
you
shall
fall
with
me
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
betrayed
yourself
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
;
"
or
rather
,
Heaven
has
placed
you
in
our
hands
as
an
instrument
for
the
liberation
of
Viviana
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
You
must
take
an
oath
of
secrecy
—
a
binding
oath,—such
as
,
being
a
good
Catholic
,
you
can
not
break,—not
to
divulge
what
has
come
to
your
knowledge
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
you
must
join
me
and
my
confederates
,
or
you
quit
not
this
spot
with
life
.
<EOS>
""I
refuse
your
terms
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
resolutely
;
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
conspire
against
the
monarch
to
whom
I
have
sworn
allegiance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
join
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
aid
you
in
procuring
Viviana
Radcliffe
's
release
.
<EOS>
Nor
will
I
take
the
oath
you
propose
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
I
arrest
you
as
a
traitor
,
and
I
command
you
,
Tresham
,
in
the
King
's
name
,
to
assist
me
in
his
capture
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
suddenly
extricating
himself
from
the
grasp
imposed
upon
him
,
and
placing
Guy
Fawkes
between
him
and
the
Earl
,
Tresham
rejoined,—"It
is
time
to
throw
off
the
mask
,
my
good
lord
and
brother
.
<EOS>
I
can
render
you
no
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
am
sworn
to
this
league
,
and
must
support
it
.
<EOS>
Unless
you
assent
to
the
conditions
proposed,—and
which
for
your
own
sake
I
would
counsel
you
to
do,—I
must
,
despite
our
near
relationship
,
take
part
against
you,—even
,
"
he
added
,
significantly
,
"
if
your
destruction
should
be
resolved
upon
.
<EOS>
""I
will
sell
my
life
dearly
,
as
you
shall
find
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
but
for
the
sake
of
my
dear
lady
,
your
sister
,
I
would
stab
you
where
you
stand
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
will
find
resistance
in
vain
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
,
keeping
his
eye
steadily
fixed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
"
We
seek
not
your
life
,
but
your
co
-
operation
.
<EOS>
You
are
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""A
prisoner
!
"
echoed
Mounteagle
,
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
not
secured
me
yet
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
,
he
rushed
towards
the
door
,
but
his
departure
was
checked
by
Bates
,
who
presented
himself
at
the
entrance
of
the
passage
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
Catesby
and
Keyes
issued
from
the
closet
,
while
Garnet
and
the
other
conspirators
likewise
emerged
from
their
hiding
-
places
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
noise
behind
him
,
Lord
Mounteagle
turned
,
and
beholding
the
group
,
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
rage
.
<EOS>
"I
am
fairly
entrapped
,
"
he
said
,
sheathing
his
sword
,
and
advancing
towards
them
.
"
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
was
,
to
venture
hither!""These
<EOS>
regrets
are
too
late
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
came
hither
of
your
own
accord
.
<EOS>
But
being
here
,
nothing
,
except
compliance
with
our
demands
,
can
ensure
your
departure
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
one
thing
else
,
"
thought
Mounteagle,—"cunning
.
<EOS>
It
shall
go
hard
if
I
can
not
outwit
you
.
<EOS>
Tresham
will
act
with
me
.
<EOS>
I
know
his
treacherous
nature
too
well
to
doubt
which
way
he
will
incline
.
<EOS>
Interest
,
as
well
as
relationship
,
binds
him
to
me
.
<EOS>
He
will
acquaint
me
with
their
plans
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
,
therefore
,
compromise
myself
by
joining
them
.
<EOS>
If
I
take
the
oath
of
secrecy
,
it
will
suffice
—
and
I
will
find
means
of
eluding
the
obligation
.
<EOS>
I
may
thus
make
my
own
bargain
with
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
proceed
cautiously
.
<EOS>
Too
sudden
a
compliance
might
awaken
their
suspicions
.
<EOS>
""My
lord
,
"
said
Catesby
,
who
had
watched
his
countenance
narrowly
,
and
distrusted
its
expression
,
"
we
must
have
no
double
-
dealing
.
<EOS>
Any
attempt
to
play
us
false
will
prove
fatal
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
have
not
yet
consented
to
your
terms
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
"
and
I
demand
a
few
moments
'
reflection
before
I
do
so
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
say
you
,
gentlemen
?
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
agree
to
his
lordship
's
request?"There
was
a
general
answer
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"I
would
also
confer
for
a
moment
alone
with
my
brother
Tresham
,
"
said
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"That
can
not
be
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
peremptorily
.
"
<EOS>
And
take
heed
you
meditate
no
treachery
towards
us
,
or
you
will
destroy
yourself
here
and
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
desire
to
speak
with
him
,
father
,
"
observed
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
declare
what
he
has
to
say
before
you
all
.
<EOS>
"Mounteagle
<EOS>
looked
hard
at
him
,
but
he
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
my
opinion
,
we
ought
not
to
trust
him
,
"
observed
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
plain
he
is
decidedly
opposed
to
us
.
<EOS>
And
if
the
oath
is
proposed
to
him
,
he
may
take
it
with
some
mental
reservation
.
<EOS>
""I
will
guard
against
that
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
I
take
the
oath
,
I
will
keep
it
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
not
yet
decided
.
<EOS>
""You
must
do
so
,
then
,
quickly
,
my
lord
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
five
minutes
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
But
first
,
you
must
deliver
up
your
sword
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Earl
started
.
<EOS>
"We
mean
you
no
treachery
,
my
lord
,
"
observed
Keyes
,
"
and
expect
to
be
dealt
with
with
equal
fairness
.
<EOS>
"Surrendering
<EOS>
his
sword
to
Catesby
,
Mounteagle
then
walked
to
the
farther
end
of
the
room
,
and
leaning
against
the
wall
,
with
his
back
to
the
conspirators
,
appeared
buried
in
thought
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
Tresham
aside
,
"
whispered
Catesby
to
Wright
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
wish
him
to
overhear
our
conference
.
<EOS>
Watch
him
narrowly
,
and
see
that
no
signal
passes
between
him
and
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"Wright
obeyed
;
and
the
others
gathering
closely
together
,
began
to
converse
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"It
will
not
do
to
put
him
to
death
,
"
observed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
From
what
he
stated
to
Tresham
,
it
appears
that
his
servant
was
aware
of
his
coming
hither
.
<EOS>
If
he
disappears
,
therefore
,
search
will
be
immediately
made
,
and
all
will
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
We
must
either
instantly
secure
ourselves
by
flight
,
and
give
up
the
enterprise
,
or
trust
him
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
father
,
"
replied
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
The
danger
is
imminent
.
<EOS>
""We
are
safe
at
present
,
"
observed
Percy
,
"
and
may
escape
to
France
or
Flanders
before
information
can
be
given
against
us
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
we
may
carry
off
Mounteagle
with
us
,
for
that
matter
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
loth
to
trust
him
.
<EOS>
""So
am
I
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
like
his
looks
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
help
,
"
said
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
trust
him
,
or
give
up
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
He
may
materially
aid
us
,
and
has
himself
asserted
that
he
can
procure
Viviana
's
liberation
from
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
that
to
do
with
the
all
-
important
question
we
are
now
considering?""Much
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
And
I
will
not
move
further
in
the
matter
unless
that
point
is
insisted
on
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
become
strangely
interested
in
Viviana
of
late
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
I
suspect
you
of
so
light
a
passion
,
I
should
say
you
loved
her
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
deep
flush
dyed
Fawkes
's
swarthy
cheeks
,
but
he
answered
in
a
voice
of
constrained
calmness,"I
do
love
her,—as
a
daughter
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
other
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
sternly
,
"
<EOS>
you
know
me
well
—
too
well
,
to
suppose
I
would
resort
to
any
paltry
subterfuge
.
<EOS>
I
am
willing
to
let
what
you
have
said
pass
.
<EOS>
But
I
counsel
you
not
to
jest
thus
in
future
.
<EOS>
""Jest
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
never
more
serious
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
do
me
wrong
,
"
retorted
Fawkes
,
fiercely
;
"
and
you
will
repeat
the
insinuation
at
your
peril
.
<EOS>
""My
sons
—
my
sons
,
"
interposed
Garnet
,
"
what
means
this
sudden
—
this
needless
quarrel
,
at
a
moment
when
we
require
the
utmost
calmness
to
meet
the
danger
that
assails
us
?
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
is
right
.
<EOS>
Viviana
must
be
saved
.
<EOS>
If
we
desert
her
,
our
cause
will
never
prosper
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
proceed
step
by
step
,
and
first
decide
upon
what
is
to
be
done
with
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
""I
am
filled
with
perplexity
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
will
decide
for
you
,
"
replied
Percy
.
<EOS>
"
Our
project
must
be
abandoned
.
<EOS>
""Never
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
energetically
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Fly
,
and
secure
your
own
safety
.
<EOS>
I
will
stay
and
accomplish
it
alone
.
<EOS>
""A
brave
resolution
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
tendering
him
his
hand
,
which
the
other
cordially
grasped
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
stand
by
you
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
No
—
we
have
advanced
too
far
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
""Additional
<EOS>
caution
will
be
needful
,
"
observed
Keyes
.
<EOS>
"
Can
we
not
make
it
a
condition
with
Lord
Mounteagle
to
retire
,
till
the
blow
is
struck
,
to
his
mansion
at
Hoxton?""That
would
be
of
no
avail
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
trust
him
wholly
,
or
not
at
all
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
I
agree
with
you
,
father
,
"
said
Percy
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
propose
the
oath
of
secrecy
to
him
,
and
detain
him
here
until
we
have
found
some
secure
retreat
,
utterly
unknown
to
him
,
or
to
Tresham
,
whence
we
can
correspond
with
our
friends
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
will
show
whether
he
has
betrayed
us
or
not
.
<EOS>
We
need
not
visit
this
place
again
till
the
moment
for
action
arrives
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
need
not
visit
it
again
at
all
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Everything
is
prepared
,
and
I
will
undertake
to
fire
the
train
.
<EOS>
Prepare
for
what
is
to
follow
the
explosion
,
and
leave
the
management
of
that
to
me
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
consent
to
such
a
course
,
my
son
,
"
said
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
The
whole
risk
will
thus
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
whole
glory
will
be
mine
,
also
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
enthusiastically
.
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
,
let
me
have
my
own
way
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
be
it
as
you
will
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
,
with
affected
reluctance
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
oppose
the
hand
of
Heaven
,
which
clearly
points
you
out
as
the
chief
agent
in
this
mighty
enterprise
.
<EOS>
In
reference
to
what
Percy
has
said
about
a
retreat
till
Lord
Mounteagle
's
trust
-
worthiness
can
be
ascertained
,
"
he
added
to
Catesby
,
"
I
have
just
bethought
me
of
a
large
retired
house
on
the
borders
of
Enfield
Chase
,
called
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
recently
taken
by
Mrs.
Brooksby
,
and
her
sister
,
Anne
Vaux
,
and
will
afford
us
a
safe
asylum
.
<EOS>
""An
excellent
plan
,
father
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Since
Guy
Fawkes
is
willing
to
undertake
the
risk
,
we
will
leave
Lord
Mounteagle
in
his
charge
,
and
go
there
at
once
.
<EOS>
""What
must
be
done
with
Tresham
?
"
asked
Percy
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
not
take
him
with
us
,
nor
must
he
know
of
our
retreat
.
<EOS>
""Leave
him
with
me
,
"
said
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"You
will
be
at
a
disadvantage
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
"
should
he
take
part
,
as
there
is
reason
to
fear
he
may
do
,
with
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
""They
are
both
unarmed
,
"
returned
Fawkes
;
"
but
were
it
otherwise
,
I
would
answer
with
my
head
for
their
detention
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
good
saints
guard
you
,
my
son
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Henceforth
,
we
resign
the
custody
of
the
powder
to
you
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
in
safe
keeping
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
The
party
then
advanced
towards
Lord
Mounteagle
,
who
,
hearing
their
approach
,
instantly
faced
them
.
<EOS>
"Your
decision
,
my
lord
?
"
demanded
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
in
a
word
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
join
you
,
but
I
will
take
the
required
oath
of
secrecy
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
your
final
resolve
,
my
lord
?
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
"It
<EOS>
must
content
us
,
"
observed
Garnet
;
"
though
we
hoped
you
would
have
lent
your
active
services
to
further
a
cause
,
having
for
its
sole
object
the
restoration
of
the
church
to
which
you
belong
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
the
means
whereby
you
propose
to
restore
it
,
father
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
"
and
I
do
not
desire
to
know
them
.
<EOS>
But
I
guess
that
they
are
dark
and
bloody
,
and
as
such
I
can
take
no
part
in
them
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
refuse
to
give
us
any
counsel
or
assistance
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
betray
you
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
say
nothing
further
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
would
rather
he
promised
too
little
,
than
too
much
,
"
whispered
Catesby
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
begin
to
think
him
sincere
.
<EOS>
""I
am
of
the
same
opinion
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
thing
you
shall
do
,
before
I
consent
to
set
you
free
,
on
any
terms
,
my
lord
,
"
observed
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
engage
to
procure
the
liberation
of
Viviana
Radcliffe
from
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
You
told
Tresham
you
could
easily
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
""I
scarcely
knew
what
I
said
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
with
a
look
of
embarrassment
.
<EOS>
"You
spoke
confidently
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
had
no
idea
I
should
be
compelled
to
make
good
my
words
,
"
returned
the
Earl
.
"
<EOS>
But
as
a
Catholic
,
and
related
by
marriage
to
Tresham
,
who
is
a
suspected
person
,
any
active
exertions
in
her
behalf
on
my
part
might
place
me
in
jeopardy
.
<EOS>
""This
excuse
shall
not
avail
you
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
weigh
your
own
safety
against
hers
.
<EOS>
You
stir
not
hence
till
you
have
sworn
to
free
her
.
<EOS>
""I
must
perforce
assent
,
since
you
will
have
no
refusal
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
almost
despair
of
success
.
<EOS>
If
I
can
effect
her
deliverance
,
I
swear
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Catesby
,
appealing
to
the
others
,
"
are
you
willing
to
let
Lord
Mounteagle
depart
upon
the
proposed
terms?""We
are
,
"
they
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
will
administer
the
oath
at
once
,
"
said
Garnet
;
"
and
you
will
bear
in
mind
,
my
son
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
stern
tone
to
the
Earl
,
"
that
it
will
be
one
which
can
not
be
violated
without
perdition
to
your
soul
.
<EOS>
""I
am
willing
to
take
it
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
Producing
a
primer
,
and
motioning
the
Earl
to
kneel
before
him
,
Garnet
then
proposed
an
oath
of
the
most
solemn
and
binding
description
.
<EOS>
The
other
repeated
it
after
him
,
and
at
its
conclusion
placed
the
book
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
satisfied
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
rising
.
<EOS>
"I
am
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
am
I
,
"
thought
Tresham
,
who
stood
in
the
rear
,
"
—
that
he
will
perjure
himself
.
<EOS>
""Am
I
now
at
liberty
to
depart
?
"
inquired
the
Earl
.
"Not
<EOS>
yet
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
remain
here
till
midnight
.
<EOS>
"Lord
<EOS>
Mounteagle
looked
uneasy
,
but
seeing
remonstrance
would
be
useless
,
he
preserved
a
sullen
silence
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
have
no
fear
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
must
take
such
precautions
as
will
ensure
our
safety
,
in
case
you
intend
us
any
treachery
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
doubt
me
,
sir
,
after
the
oath
I
have
taken
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"
But
since
you
constitute
yourself
my
jailer
,
I
must
abide
your
pleasure
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
am
your
jailer
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
I
will
prove
to
you
that
I
am
not
neglectful
of
my
office
.
<EOS>
Will
it
please
you
to
follow
<EOS>
me?"The
Earl
bowed
in
acquiescence
;
and
Catesby
,
marching
before
him
to
a
small
room
,
the
windows
of
which
were
carefully
barred
,
pointed
to
a
chair
,
and
instantly
retiring
,
locked
the
door
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
returned
to
the
others
,
and
taking
Guy
Fawkes
aside
,
observed
in
a
low
tone,"We
shall
set
out
instantly
for
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
You
will
remain
on
guard
with
Tresham
,
whom
you
will
,
of
course
,
keep
in
ignorance
of
our
proceedings
.
<EOS>
After
you
have
set
the
Earl
at
liberty
,
you
can
follow
us
if
you
choose
.
<EOS>
But
take
heed
you
are
not
observed
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Catesby
,
and
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
,
with
the
exception
of
Guy
Fawkes
and
Tresham
,
quitted
the
room
,
and
the
former
concluded
they
were
about
to
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
made
no
remark
,
however
,
to
his
companion
;
but
getting
between
him
and
the
door
,
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
continued
to
pace
backwards
and
forwards
before
it
.
<EOS>
"Am
<EOS>
I
a
prisoner
,
as
well
as
Lord
Mounteagle
?
"
asked
Tresham
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"You
must
remain
with
me
here
till
midnight
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
not
be
disturbed
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
are
the
others
gone
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"They
are
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
Tresham
's
countenance
fell
,
and
he
appeared
to
be
meditating
some
project
,
which
he
could
not
muster
courage
to
execute
.
<EOS>
"Be
warned
by
the
past
,
Tresham
,
"
said
Fawkes
,
who
had
regarded
him
fixedly
for
some
minutes
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
find
reason
to
doubt
you
,
I
will
put
it
out
of
your
power
to
betray
us
a
second
time
.
<EOS>
""You
have
no
reason
to
doubt
me
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
with
apparent
candour
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
wondered
that
our
friends
should
leave
me
without
any
intimation
of
their
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
is
for
me
,
not
you
,
to
apprehend
some
ill
design
.
<EOS>
Am
I
not
to
act
with
you
further?""That
depends
upon
yourself
,
and
on
the
proofs
you
give
of
your
sincerity
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Answer
me
frankly
.
<EOS>
Do
you
think
Lord
Mounteagle
will
keep
his
oath?""I
will
stake
my
life
upon
it
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
then
dropped
,
and
no
attempt
was
made
on
either
side
to
renew
it
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
several
hours
passed
,
when
at
length
the
silence
was
broken
by
Tresham
,
who
requested
permission
to
go
in
search
of
some
refreshment
;
and
Guy
Fawkes
assenting
,
they
descended
to
the
lower
room
,
and
partook
of
a
slight
repast
.
<EOS>
Nothing
further
worthy
of
note
occurred
.
<EOS>
On
the
arrival
of
the
appointed
hour
,
Guy
Fawkes
signified
to
his
companion
that
he
might
liberate
Lord
Mounteagle
;
and
immediately
availing
himself
of
the
permission
,
Tresham
repaired
to
the
chamber
,
and
threw
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
immediately
came
forth
,
and
they
returned
together
to
the
room
in
which
Guy
Fawkes
remained
on
guard
.
<EOS>
"You
are
now
at
liberty
to
depart
,
my
lord
,
"
said
the
latter
;
"
and
Tresham
can
accompany
you
,
if
he
thinks
proper
.
<EOS>
Remember
that
you
have
sworn
to
procure
Viviana
's
liberation
.
<EOS>
""I
do
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
And
he
then
quitted
the
house
with
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
had
a
narrow
escape
,
my
lord
,
"
remarked
the
latter
as
they
approached
Whitehall
,
and
paused
for
a
moment
under
the
postern
of
the
great
western
gate
.
<EOS>
"True
,
"
replied
the
Earl
;
"
but
I
do
not
regret
the
risk
I
have
run
.
<EOS>
They
are
now
wholly
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
forget
your
oath
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"If
I
do
,
"
replied
the
Earl
,
"
<EOS>
I
but
follow
your
example
.
<EOS>
You
have
broken
one
equally
solemn
,
equally
binding
,
and
would
break
a
thousand
more
were
they
imposed
upon
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
overthrow
this
conspiracy
,
and
yet
not
violate
mine
.
<EOS>
""I
see
not
how
that
can
be
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
learn
in
due
season
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
had
plenty
of
leisure
for
reflection
in
that
dark
hole
,
and
have
hit
upon
a
plan
which
,
I
think
,
can
not
fail
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
I
am
no
party
to
it
,
my
lord
,
"
rejoined
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
not
hazard
myself
among
them
further
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
do
without
you
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
;
"
but
I
will
ensure
you
against
all
danger
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
necessary
for
you
,
however
,
to
act
with
the
utmost
discretion
,
and
keep
a
constant
guard
upon
every
look
and
movement
,
as
well
as
upon
your
words
.
<EOS>
You
must
fully
regain
the
confidence
of
these
men
,
and
lull
them
into
security
.
<EOS>
""I
see
your
lordship
's
drift
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
You
wish
them
to
proceed
to
the
last
point
,
to
enhance
the
value
of
the
discovery
.
<EOS>
""Right
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
The
plot
must
not
be
discovered
till
just
before
its
outbreak
,
when
its
magnitude
and
danger
will
be
the
more
apparent
.
<EOS>
The
reward
will
then
be
proportionate
.
<EOS>
Now
,
you
understand
me
,
Tresham
.
<EOS>
""Fully
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Return
<EOS>
to
your
own
house
,
"
rejoined
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
We
need
hold
no
further
communication
together
till
the
time
for
action
arrives
.
<EOS>
""And
that
will
not
be
before
the
meeting
of
Parliament
,
"
replied
Tresham
;
"
for
they
intend
to
whelm
the
King
and
all
his
nobles
in
one
common
destruction
.
<EOS>
""By
Heaven
!
<EOS>
a
brave
design
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
pity
to
mar
it
.
<EOS>
I
knew
it
was
a
desperate
and
daring
project
,
but
should
never
have
conceived
aught
like
this
.
<EOS>
Its
discovery
will
indeed
occasion
universal
consternation
.
<EOS>
""It
may
benefit
you
and
me
to
divulge
it
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Tresham
;
"
but
the
disclosure
will
deeply
and
lastingly
injure
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
""It
would
injure
it
more
deeply
if
the
plot
succeeded
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
,
"
because
all
loyal
Catholics
must
disapprove
so
horrible
and
sanguinary
a
design
.
<EOS>
But
we
will
not
discuss
the
question
further
,
though
what
you
have
said
confirms
my
purpose
,
and
removes
any
misgiving
I
might
have
felt
as
to
the
betrayal
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Keep
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
conspirators
,
and
communicate
with
me
should
any
change
take
place
in
their
plans
.
<EOS>
We
may
not
meet
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
Parliament
,
though
summoned
for
the
third
of
October
,
will
,
in
all
probability
,
be
prorogued
till
November
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
case
,
"
replied
Tresham
<EOS>
,
"
you
will
postpone
your
disclosure
likewise
till
November?""Assuredly
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
King
must
be
convinced
of
his
danger
.
<EOS>
If
it
were
found
out
now
,
he
would
think
lightly
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
has
actually
set
foot
upon
the
mine
which
a
single
spark
might
kindle
to
his
destruction
,
he
will
duly
appreciate
the
service
rendered
him
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
and
do
not
neglect
my
counsel
.

WHITE
WEBBSTarrying
for
a
short
time
within
the
house
after
the
departure
of
the
others
,
Guy
Fawkes
lighted
a
lantern
,
and
concealing
it
beneath
his
cloak
,
proceeded
to
the
cellar
,
to
ascertain
that
the
magazine
of
powder
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
of
this
,
he
made
all
secure
,
and
was
about
to
return
to
the
house
,
when
he
perceived
a
figure
approaching
him
.
<EOS>
Standing
aside
,
but
keeping
on
his
guard
for
fear
of
a
surprise
,
he
would
have
allowed
the
person
to
pass
,
but
the
other
halted
,
and
after
a
moment
's
scrutiny
addressed
him
by
name
in
the
tones
of
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"You
seem
to
haunt
this
spot
,
young
sir
,
"
said
Fawkes
,
in
answer
to
the
address
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
third
time
we
have
met
hereabouts
.
<EOS>
""On
the
last
occasion
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
"
I
told
you
Viviana
was
a
prisoner
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
have
now
better
news
for
you
.
<EOS>
She
is
free
.
<EOS>
""Free
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
joyfully
.
"
<EOS>
By
Lord
Mounteagle
's
instrumentality?—But
I
forget
.
<EOS>
He
has
only
just
left
me
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
has
been
freed
by
my
instrumentality
,
"
replied
the
young
merchant
.
"
<EOS>
She
escaped
from
the
Tower
a
few
hours
ago
.
<EOS>
""Where
is
she
?
"
demanded
Guy
Fawkes
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
a
boat
at
the
stairs
near
the
Parliament
House
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
<EOS>
and
Our
Lady
be
praised
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
more
than
I
hoped
for
.
<EOS>
Your
news
is
so
good
,
young
sir
,
that
I
can
scarce
credit
it
.
<EOS>
""Come
with
me
to
the
boat
,
and
you
shall
soon
be
satisfied
of
the
truth
of
my
statement
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
.
<EOS>
And
followed
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
he
hurried
to
the
river
side
,
where
a
wherry
was
moored
.
<EOS>
Within
it
sat
Viviana
,
covered
by
the
tilt
.
<EOS>
Assisting
her
to
land
,
and
finding
she
was
too
much
exhausted
to
walk
,
Guy
Fawkes
took
her
in
his
arms
,
and
carried
her
to
the
house
he
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
followed
as
soon
as
he
had
dismissed
the
waterman
.
<EOS>
Placing
his
lovely
burthen
in
a
seat
,
Guy
Fawkes
instantly
went
in
search
of
such
restoratives
as
the
place
afforded
.
<EOS>
Viviana
was
extremely
faint
,
but
after
she
had
swallowed
a
glass
of
wine
,
she
revived
,
and
,
looking
around
her
,
inquired
where
she
was
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
ask
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
let
it
suffice
you
are
in
safety
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
he
added
,
"
perhaps
,
Humphrey
Chetham
will
inform
me
in
what
manner
he
contrived
your
escape
.
<EOS>
I
am
impatient
to
know
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
merchant
then
gave
the
required
information
,
and
Viviana
added
such
particulars
as
were
necessary
to
the
full
understanding
of
the
story
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
could
scarcely
control
himself
when
she
related
the
tortures
she
had
endured
,
nor
was
Chetham
less
indignant
.
<EOS>
"You
rescued
me
just
in
time
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
have
sunk
under
the
next
application
.
<EOS>
""Thank
<EOS>
Heaven
!
<EOS>
you
have
escaped
it
,
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
You
owe
much
to
Humphrey
Chetham
,
Viviana
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
,
indeed
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
can
you
not
requite
it
?
<EOS>
"
he
returned
.
"
<EOS>
Can
you
not
make
him
happy?—Can
<EOS>
you
not
make
me
<EOS>
happy?"Viviana
's
pale
cheek
was
instantly
suffused
with
blushes
,
but
she
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
Viviana
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Humphrey
Chetham
,
"
you
hear
what
is
said
.
<EOS>
If
you
could
doubt
my
love
before
,
you
must
be
convinced
of
it
now
.
<EOS>
A
hope
will
make
me
happy
.
<EOS>
Have
I
that?""Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
the
height
of
cruelty
,
after
your
kindness
,
to
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
young
merchant
turned
aside
to
hide
his
emotion
.
"Not
<EOS>
even
a
hope
!
"
exclaimed
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
after
what
he
has
done
.
<EOS>
Viviana
,
I
can
not
understand
you
.
<EOS>
Does
gratitude
form
no
part
of
your
nature?""I
hope
<EOS>
so
,
"
she
replied
,
"
nay
,
I
am
sure
so,—for
<EOS>
I
feel
the
deepest
gratitude
towards
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
But
gratitude
is
not
love
,
and
must
not
be
mistaken
for
it
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
the
distinction
too
well
,
"
returned
the
young
merchant
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"It
is
more
than
I
do
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
;
"
and
I
will
frankly
confess
that
I
think
the
important
services
Humphrey
Chetham
has
rendered
you
entitle
him
to
your
hand
.
<EOS>
It
is
seldom
—
whatever
poets
may
feign,—that
love
is
so
strongly
proved
as
his
has
been
;
and
it
ought
to
be
adequately
requited
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
no
more
about
it
<EOS>
,
I
entreat
,
"
interposed
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
will
deliver
my
opinion
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
because
I
am
sure
what
I
advise
is
for
Viviana
's
happiness
.
<EOS>
No
one
can
love
her
better
than
you
.
<EOS>
No
one
is
more
worthy
of
her
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
there
any
one
to
whom
I
so
much
desire
to
see
her
united
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
Heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
worse
than
the
torture
.
<EOS>
""What
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"She
means
,
"
interposed
Chetham
,
"
that
this
is
not
the
fitting
season
to
urge
the
subject
—
that
she
will
never
marry
.
<EOS>
""True
—
true
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
ever
did
marry
—
I
ought
to
select
you
.
<EOS>
""You
ought
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
know
nothing
of
the
female
heart
,
if
it
can
be
insensible
to
youth
,
devotion
,
and
manly
appearance
like
that
of
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
know
nothing
of
it
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
Women
's
fancies
are
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
""Such
is
the
received
opinion
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
but
as
I
am
ignorant
of
the
sex
,
I
can
only
judge
from
report
.
<EOS>
You
are
the
person
I
should
imagine
she
would
love
—
<EOS>
nay
,
to
be
frank
,
whom
I
thought
she
didlove
.
<EOS>
""No
more
,
"
said
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
painful
both
to
Viviana
and
to
me
.
<EOS>
""This
is
not
a
time
for
delicacy
,
"
rejoined
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Viviana
has
given
me
the
privilege
of
a
father
with
her
.
<EOS>
And
where
her
happiness
is
so
much
concerned
as
in
the
present
case
,
I
should
imperfectly
discharge
my
duty
if
I
did
not
speak
out
.
<EOS>
It
would
sincerely
rejoice
me
,
and
I
am
sure
contribute
materially
to
her
own
happiness
,
if
she
would
unite
herself
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
cannot
—
I
can
not
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
marry
.
<EOS>
""You
hear
what
she
says
,
"
remarked
Chetham
.
"
Do
not
urge
the
matter
further
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
admire
maiden
delicacy
and
reserve
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
but
when
a
man
has
acted
as
you
have
done
,
he
deserves
to
be
treated
with
frankness
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
Viviana
loves
you
.
<EOS>
Let
her
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
"
replied
Chetham
;
"
and
it
is
time
you
should
be
undeceived
.
<EOS>
She
loves
another
.
<EOS>
""Is
this
<EOS>
so
?
"
cried
Fawkes
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
She
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"Whom
do
you
love
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Still
,
no
answer
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
whom
she
loves
—
and
let
her
contradict
me
if
I
am
wrong
,
"
said
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
no!—no!—in
pity
spare
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Speak!"—thundered
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
is
it?""Yourself
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"What
!
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
,
recoiling,—"love
me
!
<EOS>
I
will
not
believe
it
.
<EOS>
She
loves
me
as
a
father
—
but
nothing
more
—
nothing
more
.
<EOS>
But
you
were
right
.
<EOS>
Let
us
change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
A
more
fitting
season
may
arrive
for
its
discussion
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
some
further
conversation
,
it
was
agreed
that
Viviana
should
be
taken
to
White
Webbs
;
and
leaving
her
in
charge
of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
Guy
Fawkes
went
in
search
of
a
conveyance
to
Enfield
.
<EOS>
Traversing
the
Strand,—every
hostel
in
which
was
closed,—he
turned
up
Wych
-
street
,
immediately
on
the
right
of
which
there
was
a
large
inn
<EOS>
(
still
in
existence
)
,
and
entering
the
yard
,
discovered
a
knot
of
carriers
moving
about
with
lanterns
in
their
hands
.
<EOS>
To
his
inquiries
respecting
a
conveyance
to
Enfield
,
one
of
them
answered
,
that
he
was
about
to
return
thither
with
his
waggon
at
four
o'clock,—it
was
then
two,—and
should
be
glad
to
take
him
and
his
friends
.
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
the
intelligence
,
and
at
once
agreeing
to
the
man
's
terms
,
Guy
Fawkes
hurried
back
to
his
companions
,
and
,
with
the
assistance
of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
contrived
to
carry
Viviana
(
for
she
was
utterly
unable
to
support
herself
)
to
the
inn
-
yard
,
where
she
was
immediately
placed
in
the
waggon
,
on
a
heap
of
fresh
straw
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
this
,
but
long
before
daybreak
,
the
carrier
attached
his
horses
to
the
waggon
,
and
set
out
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
and
Humphrey
Chetham
were
seated
near
Viviana
,
but
little
was
said
during
the
journey
,
which
occupied
about
three
hours
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
it
was
broad
daylight
;
and
as
the
carrier
stopped
at
the
door
of
a
small
inn
,
Guy
Fawkes
alighted
,
and
inquired
the
distance
to
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
"It
is
about
a
mile
and
a
half
off
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
pursue
that
lane
,
it
will
bring
you
to
a
small
village
about
half
a
mile
from
this
,
where
you
are
sure
to
find
some
one
who
will
gladly
guide
you
to
the
house
,
which
is
a
little
out
of
the
road
,
on
the
borders
of
the
forest
.
"He
<EOS>
then
assisted
Viviana
to
alight
,
and
Humphrey
Chetham
descending
at
the
same
time
,
the
party
took
the
road
indicated
—
a
winding
country
lane
with
high
hedges
,
broken
by
beautiful
timber
—
and
proceeding
at
a
slow
pace
,
they
arrived
in
about
half
an
hour
at
a
little
cluster
of
cottages
,
which
Guy
Fawkes
guessed
to
be
the
village
alluded
to
by
the
carrier
.
<EOS>
As
they
approached
it
,
a
rustic
leaped
a
hedge
,
and
was
about
to
cross
to
another
field
,
when
Guy
Fawkes
calling
to
him
,
inquired
the
way
to
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
"I
am
going
in
that
direction
,
"
replied
the
man
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
desire
it
,
I
will
show
you
the
road
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
feel
much
indebted
to
you
,
friend
,
"
returned
Fawkes
,
"
and
will
reward
you
for
your
trouble
.
<EOS>
""I
want
no
reward
,
"
returned
the
countryman
,
trudging
forward
.
<EOS>
Following
their
guide
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
brisk
walking
they
reached
the
borders
of
the
forest
,
and
took
their
way
along
a
patch
of
greensward
that
skirted
it
.
<EOS>
In
some
places
their
track
was
impeded
by
gigantic
thorns
and
brushwood
,
while
at
others
avenues
opened
upon
them
,
affording
them
peeps
into
the
heart
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautiful
sylvan
scene
.
<EOS>
And
as
at
length
they
arrived
at
the
head
of
a
long
glade
,
at
the
farther
end
of
which
a
herd
of
deer
were
seen
,
with
their
branching
antlers
mingling
with
the
overhanging
boughs
,
Viviana
could
not
help
pausing
to
admire
it
.
<EOS>
"King
<EOS>
James
often
hunts
within
the
forest
,
"
observed
the
countryman
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
heard
one
of
the
rangers
say
it
was
not
unlikely
he
might
be
here
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
He
is
at
Theobald
's
Palace
now
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
proceed
.
<EOS>
We
lose
time
.
<EOS>
Are
we
far
from
the
house?""Not
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
"
was
the
answer
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
it
at
the
next
turn
of
the
road
.
<EOS>
"As
the
countryman
had
intimated
,
they
speedily
perceived
the
roof
and
tall
chimneys
of
an
ancient
house
above
the
trees
,
and
as
it
was
now
impossible
to
mistake
the
road
,
Guy
Fawkes
thanked
their
guide
for
his
trouble
,
and
would
have
rewarded
him
,
but
he
refused
the
gratuity
,
and
leaping
a
hedge
,
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
the
road
,
they
shortly
afterwards
arrived
at
a
gate
leading
to
the
house
—
a
large
building
,
erected
probably
at
the
beginning
of
Elizabeth
's
reign
—
and
entering
it
,
they
passed
under
an
avenue
of
trees
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
mansion
,
they
observed
that
many
of
the
windows
were
closed
,
and
the
whole
appearance
of
the
place
was
melancholy
and
deserted
.
<EOS>
The
garden
was
overgrown
with
weeds
,
and
the
door
looked
as
if
it
was
rarely
opened
.
<EOS>
Not
discouraged
by
these
appearances
,
but
rather
satisfied
by
them
of
the
security
of
the
asylum
,
Guy
Fawkes
proceeded
to
the
back
of
the
house
,
and
entering
a
court
,
the
flags
and
stones
of
which
were
covered
with
moss
,
while
the
interstices
were
filled
with
long
grass
,
Guy
Fawkes
knocked
against
a
small
door
,
and
,
after
repeating
the
summons
,
it
was
answered
by
an
old
woman
-
servant
,
who
popped
her
head
out
of
an
upper
window
,
and
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
about
to
inquire
for
Mrs.
Brooksby
,
when
another
head
,
which
proved
to
be
that
of
Catesby
,
appeared
at
the
window
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
Fawkes
and
his
companions
,
Catesby
instantly
descended
,
and
unfastened
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
house
proved
far
more
comfortable
within
than
its
exterior
promised
;
and
the
old
female
domestic
having
taken
word
to
Anne
Vaux
that
Viviana
was
below
,
the
former
lady
,
who
had
not
yet
risen
,
sent
for
her
to
her
chamber
,
and
provided
everything
for
her
comfort
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
and
Humphrey
Chetham
,
neither
of
whom
had
rested
during
the
night
,
were
glad
to
obtain
a
few
hours
'
repose
on
the
floor
of
the
first
room
into
which
they
were
shown
,
and
they
were
not
disturbed
until
the
day
had
considerably
advanced
,
when
Catesby
thought
fit
to
rouse
them
from
their
slumbers
.
<EOS>
Explanations
were
then
given
on
both
sides
.
<EOS>
Chetham
detailed
the
manner
of
Viviana
's
escape
from
the
Tower
,
and
Catesby
in
his
turn
acquainted
them
that
Father
Oldcorne
was
in
the
house
,
having
found
his
way
thither
after
his
escape
from
the
dwelling
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
greatly
rejoiced
at
the
intelligence
,
and
shortly
afterwards
had
the
satisfaction
of
meeting
with
the
priest
.
<EOS>
At
noon
,
the
whole
party
assembled
,
with
the
exception
of
Viviana
,
who
,
by
the
advice
of
Anne
Vaux
,
kept
her
chamber
,
to
recruit
herself
after
the
sufferings
she
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
,
of
whom
no
suspicions
were
now
entertained
,
and
of
whom
Catesby
no
longer
felt
any
jealousy
,
was
invited
to
stay
in
the
house
;
and
he
was
easily
induced
to
pass
his
time
near
Viviana
,
although
he
might
not
be
able
to
see
her
.
<EOS>
Long
and
frequent
consultations
were
held
by
the
conspirators
,
and
letters
were
despatched
by
Catesby
to
the
elder
Winter
at
his
seat
,
Huddington
,
in
Worcestershire
,
entreating
him
to
make
every
preparation
for
the
crisis
,
as
well
as
to
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
to
desire
him
to
assemble
as
many
friends
as
he
could
muster
against
the
meeting
of
Parliament
,
at
Dunchurch
,
in
Warwickshire
,
under
the
plea
of
a
grand
hunting
-
party
.
<EOS>
Arrangements
were
next
made
as
to
the
steps
to
be
taken
by
the
different
parties
after
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
Catesby
undertook
,
with
a
sufficient
force
,
to
seize
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
the
eldest
daughter
of
James
the
First
,
who
was
then
at
the
residence
of
the
Earl
of
Harrington
,
near
Coventry
,
and
to
proclaim
her
queen
,
in
case
the
others
should
fail
in
securing
the
princes
.
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
that
Henry
,
Prince
of
Wales
,
(
who
,
it
need
scarcely
be
mentioned
,
died
in
his
youth
,
)
would
be
present
with
the
King
,
his
father
,
in
the
Parliament
House
,
and
would
perish
with
him
;
and
in
this
case
,
as
Charles
,
Duke
of
York
,
(
afterwards
Charles
the
First
,
)
would
become
successor
to
the
throne
,
it
was
resolved
that
he
should
be
seized
by
Percy
,
and
instantly
proclaimed
.
<EOS>
Other
resolutions
were
decided
upon
,
and
the
whole
time
of
the
conspirators
was
spent
in
maturing
their
projects
.
<EOS>
And
thus
weeks
,
and
even
months
,
stole
on
.
<EOS>
Viviana
had
completely
regained
her
strength
,
and
passed
a
life
of
perfect
seclusion
,
seldom
,
if
ever
,
mixing
with
the
others
.
<EOS>
She
,
however
,
took
a
kindly
farewell
of
Humphrey
Chetham
,
before
his
departure
for
Manchester
(
for
which
place
he
set
out
about
a
fortnight
after
his
arrival
at
White
Webbs
,
having
first
sought
out
his
servant
,
Martin
Heydocke
)
;
but
though
strongly
urged
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
she
would
hold
out
no
hopes
of
a
change
in
her
sentiments
towards
the
young
merchant
.
<EOS>
Meetings
were
occasionally
held
by
the
conspirators
elsewhere
,
and
Catesby
and
Fawkes
had
more
than
one
interview
with
Tresham
—
but
never
,
except
in
places
where
they
were
secure
from
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
latter
end
of
September
had
now
arrived
,
and
the
meeting
of
Parliament
was
still
fixed
for
the
third
of
October
.
<EOS>
On
the
last
day
of
the
month
,
Guy
Fawkes
prepared
to
start
for
town
;
but
before
doing
so
he
desired
to
see
Viviana
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
met
for
some
weeks
;
nor
,
indeed
,
since
Fawkes
had
discovered
the
secret
of
her
heart
,
(
and
perhaps
of
his
own
,
)
had
they
ever
met
with
the
same
freedom
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
As
she
entered
the
room
,
in
which
he
awaited
her
coming
,
a
tremor
agitated
his
frame
,
but
he
had
nerved
himself
for
the
interview
,
and
speedily
subdued
the
feeling
.
<EOS>
"I
am
starting
for
London
,
Viviana
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
of
forced
calmness
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
guess
for
what
purpose
.
<EOS>
But
as
I
may
never
behold
you
again
,
I
would
not
part
with
you
without
a
confession
of
my
weakness
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
that
what
Humphrey
Chetham
stated
,
and
which
you
have
never
contradicted
—
namely
,
that
you
loved
me
,
for
I
must
speak
out
—
has
produced
a
strong
effect
upon
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
endeavoured
to
conquer
it
,
but
it
will
return
.
<EOS>
Till
I
knew
you
I
never
loved
,
Viviana
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Never
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
The
fairest
had
not
power
to
move
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
grieve
to
say
—
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
struggles
—
I
do
not
continue
equally
insensible
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
"
she
ejaculated
,
becoming
as
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
should
I
hesitate
to
declare
my
feelings
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
not
tell
you
that
—
though
blinded
to
it
so
long
—
I
have
discovered
that
I
do
love
you
?
<EOS>
Why
should
I
hesitate
to
tell
you
that
I
regret
this
,
and
lament
that
<EOS>
we
ever
met?""What
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Viviana
,
with
a
terrified
look
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Till
I
saw
you
,
my
thoughts
were
removed
from
earth
,
and
fixed
on
one
object
.
<EOS>
Till
I
saw
you
,
I
asked
not
to
live
,
but
to
die
the
death
of
a
martyr
.
""Die
<EOS>
so
still
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
"
<EOS>
Forget
me
—
<EOS>
oh
!
forget
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
can
not
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
striven
against
it
.
<EOS>
But
your
image
is
perpetually
before
me
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
at
this
very
moment
,
when
I
am
about
to
set
out
on
the
enterprise
,
you
alone
detain
me
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
fervently
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
that
I
could
prevent
you
—
could
save
you!""Save
me
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Fawkes
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
You
destroy
me
.
""How
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
am
sworn
to
this
project
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
and
if
I
were
turned
from
it
,
I
would
perish
by
my
own
hand
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
say
not
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
but
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
Abandon
it
,
and
I
will
devote
myself
to
you
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
passionately
,
and
then
,
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
,
appeared
torn
by
conflicting
emotions
.
<EOS>
Viviana
approached
him
,
and
pressing
his
arm
,
asked
in
an
entreating
voice
,
"
Are
you
still
determined
to
pursue
your
dreadful
project?""I
am
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
uncovering
his
face
,
and
gazing
at
her
;
"
but
,
if
I
remain
here
a
moment
longer
,
I
shall
not
be
able
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""I
will
detain
you
,
then
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
and
exercise
the
power
I
possess
over
you
for
your
benefit
.
<EOS>
""No
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
replied
,
vehemently
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
not
be
.
<EOS>
Farewell
,
for
ever!"And
breaking
from
her
,
he
rushed
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
As
he
gained
the
passage
,
he
encountered
Catesby
,
who
looked
abashed
at
seeing
him
.
<EOS>
"I
have
overheard
what
has
passed
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
and
applaud
your
resolution
.
<EOS>
Few
men
,
similarly
circumstanced
,
would
have
acted
as
you
have
done
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
would
not
,
"
said
Fawkes
,
coldly
.
"Perhaps
<EOS>
not
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
that
does
not
lessen
my
admiration
of
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
""I
am
devoted
to
one
object
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
and
nothing
shall
turn
me
from
it
.
<EOS>
""Remove
yourself
instantly
from
temptation
<EOS>
,
then
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
meet
you
at
the
cellar
beneath
the
Parliament
House
to
-
morrow
night
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
accompanied
Guy
Fawkes
to
the
door
;
and
the
latter
,
without
hazarding
a
look
behind
him
,
set
out
for
London
,
where
he
arrived
at
nightfall
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
night
,
Fawkes
examined
the
cellar
,
and
found
it
in
all
respects
as
he
had
left
it
;
and
,
apprehensive
lest
some
difficulty
might
arise
,
he
resolved
to
make
every
preparation
.
<EOS>
He
,
accordingly
,
pierced
the
sides
of
several
of
the
barrels
piled
against
the
walls
with
a
gimlet
,
and
inserted
in
the
holes
small
pieces
of
slow
-
burning
match
.
<EOS>
Not
content
with
this
,
he
staved
in
the
tops
of
the
uppermost
tier
,
and
scattered
powder
among
them
to
secure
their
instantaneous
ignition
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
took
a
powder
-
horn
,
with
which
he
was
provided
,
and
kneeling
down
,
and
holding
his
lantern
so
as
to
throw
a
light
upon
the
floor
,
laid
a
train
to
one
of
the
lower
barrels
,
and
brought
it
within
a
few
inches
of
the
door
,
intending
to
fire
it
from
that
point
.
<EOS>
His
arrangements
completed
,
he
arose
,
and
muttered,"A
vessel
is
provided
for
my
escape
in
the
river
,
and
my
companions
advise
me
to
use
a
slow
match
,
which
will
allow
me
to
get
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
see
the
deed
done
,
and
if
the
train
fails
,
will
hold
a
torch
to
the
barrels
myself
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
a
slight
tap
was
heard
without
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
instantly
masked
his
lantern
,
and
cautiously
opening
the
door
,
beheld
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
come
to
tell
you
that
Parliament
is
prorogued
,
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
House
does
not
meet
till
the
fifth
of
November
.
<EOS>
We
have
another
month
to
wait
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
for
it
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
just
laid
the
train
.
<EOS>
The
lucky
moment
will
pass
.
"And
,
locking
the
door
,
he
proceeded
with
Catesby
to
the
adjoining
house
.
<EOS>
They
had
scarcely
been
gone
more
than
a
second
,
when
two
figures
muffled
in
cloaks
emerged
from
behind
a
wall
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
train
is
laid
,
"
observed
the
foremost
,
"
and
they
are
gone
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
You
might
seize
them
now
without
danger
.
<EOS>
""That
will
not
answer
my
purpose
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
give
them
another
month
.
<EOS>
""Another
month
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
Who
knows
what
may
happen
in
that
time
?
<EOS>
They
may
abandon
their
project
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
fear
of
that
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
had
better
go
and
join
them
.

"XI

<EOS>
—
THE
MARRIAGE
IN
THE
FORESTTresham
,
for
it
will
have
been
conjectured
that
he
was
one
of
the
speakers
mentioned
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
on
separating
from
Lord
Mounteagle
,
took
the
same
direction
as
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
He
hesitated
for
some
time
before
venturing
to
knock
at
the
garden
-
gate
;
and
when
he
had
done
so
,
felt
half
-
disposed
to
take
to
his
heels
.
<EOS>
But
shame
restrained
him
;
and
hearing
footsteps
approach
,
he
gave
the
customary
signal
,
and
was
instantly
admitted
by
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"What
brings
you
here
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
latter
,
as
they
entered
the
house
,
and
made
fast
the
door
behind
them
.
<EOS>
"I
have
just
heard
that
Parliament
is
prorogued
to
the
fifth
of
November
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
"
and
came
to
tell
you
so
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
already
know
it
,
"
returned
Fawkes
,
gloomily
;
"
and
for
the
first
time
feel
some
misgiving
as
to
the
issue
of
our
enterprise
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so
?
"
inquired
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"November
<EOS>
is
unlucky
to
me
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
"
and
I
can
not
recollect
a
year
in
my
life
in
which
some
ill
has
not
befallen
me
during
that
month
,
especially
on
the
fifth
day
.
<EOS>
On
the
last
fifth
of
November
,
I
nearly
died
of
a
fever
at
Madrid
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
strange
and
unfortunate
coincidence
that
the
meeting
of
the
Parliament
should
be
appointed
for
that
particular
day
.
<EOS>
""Shall
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
I
think
it
portends
?
"
hesitated
Tresham
.
"Do
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
and
speak
boldly
.
<EOS>
I
am
no
child
to
be
frightened
at
shadows
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
more
than
once
declared
your
intention
of
perishing
with
our
foes
,
"
rejoined
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
design
,
though
prosperous
in
itself
,
may
be
fatal
to
you
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
little
doubt
I
shall
perish
on
that
day
.
<EOS>
You
are
both
aware
of
my
superstitious
nature
,
and
are
not
ignorant
that
many
mysterious
occurrences
have
combined
to
strengthen
the
feeling,—such
as
the
dying
words
of
the
prophetess
,
Elizabeth
Orton,—her
warning
speech
when
she
was
raised
from
the
dead
by
Doctor
Dee,—and
lastly
,
the
vision
at
<EOS>
St.
Winifred
's
Well
.
<EOS>
What
if
I
tell
you
the
saint
has
again
appeared
to
me?""In
a
dream
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Catesby
,
in
a
slightly
sceptical
tone
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
in
a
dream
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
saw
her
as
plainly
as
if
I
had
been
awake
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
same
vapoury
figure
—
the
same
transparent
robes
,
the
same
benign
countenance
,
only
far
more
pitying
than
before
—
that
I
beheld
at
Holywell
.
<EOS>
I
heard
no
sound
issue
from
her
lips
,
but
I
feltthat
she
warned
me
to
desist
.
<EOS>
""Do
you
accept
the
warning
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Tresham
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"It
is
needless
to
answer
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
laid
the
train
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
infected
me
with
your
misgivings
,
"
observed
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Would
the
enterprise
had
never
been
undertaken!""But
being
undertaken
,
it
must
be
gone
through
with
,

rejoined
Catesby
,
sternly
.
"
<EOS>
Hark'e
,
Tresham
.
<EOS>
You
promised
us
two
thousand
pounds
in
aid
of
the
project
,
but
have
constantly
deferred
payment
of
the
sum
on
some
plea
or
other
.
<EOS>
""Because
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
able
to
raise
it
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
sullenly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
tried
in
vain
to
sell
part
of
my
estates
at
Rushton
,
in
Northamptonshire
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
effect
impossibilities
.
<EOS>
""Tush
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
You
well
know
I
ask
no
impossibility
.
<EOS>
I
will
no
longer
be
trifled
with
.
<EOS>
The
money
must
be
forthcoming
by
the
tenth
of
October
,
or
you
shall
pay
the
penalty
with
your
life
.
<EOS>
""This
is
the
language
of
a
cut
-
throat
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
replied
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
only
language
I
will
hold
towards
you
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
Look
you
disappoint
me
not
,
or
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""I
must
leave
for
Northamptonshire
at
once
,
then
,
"
said
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
as
you
please
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Play
the
cut
-
throat
yourself
,
and
ease
some
rich
miser
of
his
store
,
if
you
think
fit
.
<EOS>
Bring
us
the
money
,
and
we
will
not
ask
how
you
came
by
it
.
<EOS>
""Before
<EOS>
we
separate
,
"
said
Tresham
,
disregarding
these
sneers
<EOS>
,
"
I
wish
to
be
resolved
on
one
point
.
<EOS>
Who
are
to
be
saved
from
destruction?""Why
<EOS>
do
you
ask
?
"
inquired
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
must
stipulate
for
the
lives
of
my
brothers
-
in
-
law
,
the
Lords
Mounteagle
and
Stourton
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
anything
detains
them
from
the
meeting
,
well
and
good
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
But
no
warning
must
be
given
them
.
<EOS>
That
would
infallibly
lead
to
a
discovery
of
the
plot
.
<EOS>
""Some
means
might
surely
be
adopted
to
put
them
on
their
guard
without
danger
to
ourselves
?
"
urged
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
of
none
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
did
,
I
would
warn
Lord
Montague
,
and
some
others
whom
I
shall
grieve
to
destroy
.
<EOS>
""We
are
all
similarly
circumstanced
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Keyes
is
anxious
for
the
preservation
of
his
patron
and
friend
,
Lord
Mordaunt,—Percy
,
for
the
Earl

Northumberland
.
<EOS>
I
,
myself
,
would
gladly
save
the
young
Earl
of
Arundel

<EOS>
But
we
must
sacrifice
our
private
feeling
for
the
general
good
.
<EOS>
""We
must

acquiesced
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
shall
not
meet
again
till
the
night
of
the
tenth
of
October

said
Catesby

when
take
care
you
are
in
readiness

the
money
.
<EOS>
"Upon
this
<EOS>
,
the
conversation
dropped
,
and
soon
afterwards
Tresham
departed
.
<EOS>
When
he
found
himself
alone
,
he
suffered
his
rage
to
find
vent
in
words
.
"
<EOS>
Perdition
seize
them
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
I
shall
now
lose
two
thousand
pounds
,
in
addition
to
what
I
have
already
advanced
;
and
,
as
Mounteagle
will
not
have
the
disclosure
made
till
the
beginning
of
November
,
there
is
no
way
of
avoiding
payment
.
<EOS>
They
would
not
fall
into
the
snare
I
laid
to
throw
the
blame
of
the
discovery
,
when
it
takes
place
,
upon
their
own
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
devise
some
other
plan
.
<EOS>
The
warning
shall
proceed
from
an
unknown
quarter
.
<EOS>
A
letter
,
written
in
a
feigned
hand
,
and
giving
some
obscure
intimation
of
danger
,
shall
be
delivered
with
an
air
of
mystery
to
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
This
will
serve
as
a
plea
for
its
divulgement
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
they
shall
have
the
money
;
but
they
shall
pay
me
back
in
other
coin
.
<EOS>
"Early
<EOS>
on
the
following
day
,
Catesby
and
Fawkes
proceeded
to
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
them
,
and
could
not
conceal
his
disappointment
at
the
cause
of
their
return
.
<EOS>
"This
delay
bodes
<EOS>
no
good
,
"
he
observed
.
<EOS>
"
Parliament
has
been
so
often
prorogued
,
that
I
begin
to
think
some
suspicion
is
entertained
of
our
design
.
<EOS>
""Make
<EOS>
your
mind
easy
,
then
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
due
inquiries
,
and
find
the
meeting
is
postponed
to
suit
the
King
's
convenience
,
who
wishes
to
prolong
his
stay
at
Royston
.
<EOS>
He
may
probably
have
some
secret
motive
for
the
delay
,
but
I
am
sure
it
in
no
way
concerns
us
.
<EOS>
"Everything
<EOS>
being
now
fully
arranged
,
the
conspirators
had
only
to
wait
patiently
for
the
arrival
of
the
expected
fifth
of
November
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
decided
upon
passing
the
interval
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Ambrose
Rookwood
departed
for
Clopton
,
near
Stratford
-
upon
-
Avon,—a
seat
belonging
to
Lord
Carew
,
where
his
family
were
staying
.
<EOS>
Keyes
went
to
visit
Lord
Mordaunt
at
Turvey
,
in
Bedfordshire
;
and
Percy
and
the
two
Wrights
set
out
for
Gothurst
,
in
Buckinghamshire
,
to
desire
Sir
Everard
Digby
to
postpone
the
grand
hunting
-
party
which
he
was
to
hold
at
Dunsmore
Heath
,
as
an
excuse
for
mustering
a
strong
party
of
Catholics
,
to
the
beginning
of
November
.
<EOS>
The
two
Winters
repaired
to
their
family
mansion
,
Huddington
,
in
Worcestershire
;
while
Fawkes
and
Catesby
,
together
with
the
two
priests
,
remained
at
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
The
three
latter
held
daily
conferences
together
,
but
were
seldom
joined
by
Fawkes
,
who
passed
his
time
in
the
adjoining
forest
,
selecting
its
densest
and
most
intricate
parts
for
his
rambles
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
beginning
of
October
,
and
,
as
is
generally
the
case
in
the
early
part
of
this
month
,
the
weather
was
fine
,
and
the
air
pure
and
bracing
.
<EOS>
The
forest
could
scarcely
have
been
seen
to
greater
advantage
.
<EOS>
The
leaves
had
assumed
their
gorgeous
autumnal
tints
,
and
the
masses
of
timber
,
variegated
in
colour
,
presented
an
inexpressibly
beautiful
appearance
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
spent
hours
in
the
depths
of
the
wood
.
<EOS>
His
sole
companions
were
the
lordly
stag
and
the
timid
hare
,
that
occasionally
started
across
his
path
.
<EOS>
Since
his
return
,
he
had
sedulously
avoided
Viviana
,
and
they
had
met
only
twice
,
and
then
no
speech
had
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
when
he
had
plunged
even
deeper
than
usual
into
the
forest
,
and
had
seated
himself
on
the
stump
of
a
decayed
tree
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
small
clear
rivulet
welling
at
his
feet
,
he
saw
the
reflection
of
a
female
figure
in
the
water
;
and
,
filled
with
the
idea
of
the
vision
of
Saint
Winifred
,
at
first
imagined
he
was
about
to
receive
another
warning
.
<EOS>
But
a
voice
that
thrilled
to
his
heart
's
core
,
soon
undeceived
him
,
and
,
turning
,
he
beheld
Viviana
.
<EOS>
She
was
habited
in
a
riding
-
dress
,
and
appeared
prepared
to
set
out
upon
a
journey
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
have
tracked
me
to
my
solitude
,
"
he
observed
,
in
a
tone
of
forced
coldness
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
I
was
secure
from
interruption
here
.
<EOS>
""You
will
forgive
me
<EOS>
,
I
am
sure
,
when
you
know
my
errand
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
take
an
eternal
farewell
of
you
.
""Indeed
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"
Are
you
about
to
quit
White
Webbs?""I
<EOS>
am
,
"
she
mournfully
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
about
to
set
out
with
Father
Oldcorne
for
Gothurst
,
where
I
shall
remain
till
all
is
over
.
<EOS>
""I
entirely
approve
your
determination
,
"
returned
Fawkes
,
after
a
short
pause
.
<EOS>
"I
knew
you
would
do
so
,
or
I
should
have
consulted
you
upon
it
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
as
you
appear
to
avoid
me
,
I
would
fain
have
departed
without
taking
leave
of
you
,
but
found
it
impossible
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
well
know
my
motive
for
avoiding
you
,
Viviana
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
no
longer
what
we
were
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
A
fearful
struggle
has
taken
place
within
me
,
though
I
have
preserved
an
unmoved
exterior
,
between
passion
and
the
sense
of
my
high
calling
.
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
I
never
loved
before
,
and
fancied
my
heart
immoveable
as
adamant
.
<EOS>
But
I
now
find
out
my
error
.
<EOS>
It
is
a
prey
to
a
raging
and
constant
flame
.
<EOS>
I
have
shunned
you
,
"
he
continued
,
with
increased
excitement
,
"
because
the
sight
of
you
shakes
my
firmness,—because
<EOS>
I
feel
it
sinful
to
think
of
you
in
preference
to
holier
objects,—and
<EOS>
because
,
after
I
have
quitted
you
,
your
image
alone
engrosses
my
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Here
,
in
the
depths
of
this
wood
,
by
the
side
of
this
brook
,
I
can
commune
with
my
soul,—can
abstract
myself
from
the
world
and
the
thoughts
of
the
world
—
from
you
—
<EOS>
yes
,
you
,
who
are
all
the
world
to
me
now,—and
prepare
to
meet
my
end
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
are
resolved
to
die
?
<EOS>
"
she
cried
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
abide
the
explosion
,
and
nothing
but
a
miracle
can
save
me
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
think
not
it
will
be
exerted
in
your
behalf
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
does
not
approve
your
design
,
and
you
will
assuredly
incur
its
vengeance
by
your
criminal
conduct
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Guy
Fawkes
,
rising
,
"
man
can
not
read
my
heart
,
but
Heaven
can
;
and
the
sincerity
of
my
purpose
will
be
recognised
above
.
<EOS>
What
I
am
about
to
do
is
for
the
regeneration
of
our
holy
religion
;
and
if
the
welfare
of
that
religion
is
dear
to
the
Supreme
Being
,
our
cause
must
prosper
.
<EOS>
If
the
contrary
,
it
deserves
to
fail
,
and
will
fail
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
told
you
that
I
care
not
what
becomes
of
myself
.
<EOS>
I
am
now
more
than
ever
indifferent
to
life,—or
rather
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
sombre
tone
,
"
I
am
anxious
to
die
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
dreadful
wish
<EOS>
,
I
fear
,
will
be
accomplished
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
sadly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
constantly
haunted
by
frightful
apprehensions
respecting
you
,
and
my
dead
father
has
appeared
to
me
in
my
dreams
.
<EOS>
His
spirit
,
if
such
it
were
,
seemed
to
gaze
upon
me
with
a
mournful
look
,
and
,
as
I
thought
,
pronounced
your
name
in
piteous
accents
.
<EOS>
""These
<EOS>
forebodings
chime
with
my
own
<EOS>
,
"
muttered
Fawkes
,
repressing
a
shudder
;
"
but
nothing
shall
shake
me
.
<EOS>
It
will
inflict
a
bitter
pang
upon
me
to
part
with
you
,
<EOS>
Viviana,—the
bitterest
<EOS>
I
can
ever
feel,—and
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
when
it
is
over
.
<EOS>
""I
echo
your
own
wish
,
"
she
returned
,
"
and
deeply
lament
that
we
ever
met
.
<EOS>
But
the
fate
that
brought
us
together
must
for
ever
unite
us
.
<EOS>
""What
mean
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
inquired
,
gazing
fixedly
at
her
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
one
sad
consolation
which
you
can
afford
me
,
and
which
you
owe
me
for
the
deep
and
lasting
misery
I
shall
endure
on
your
account
,
"
replied
Viviana;—"a
consolation
that
will
enable
me
to
bear
your
loss
with
fortitude
,
and
to
devote
myself
wholly
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""Whatever
I
can
do
that
will
not
interfere
with
my
purpose
,
you
may
command
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
I
have
to
propose
will
not
interfere
with
it
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Now
,
hear
me
,
and
put
the
sole
construction
I
deserve
on
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
Father
Garnet
is
at
a
short
distance
from
us
,
behind
those
trees
,
waiting
my
summons
.
<EOS>
I
have
informed
him
of
my
design
,
and
he
approves
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
to
unite
us
in
marriage
—
solemnly
unite
us
—
that
though
I
may
never
live
with
you
as
a
wife
,
I
may
mourn
you
as
a
widow
.
<EOS>
Do
you
<EOS>
consent?"Guy
Fawkes
returned
an
affirmative
,
in
a
voice
broken
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
moment
the
ceremony
is
over
,
"
pursued
Viviana
,
"
I
shall
start
with
Father
Oldcorne
for
Gothurst
.
<EOS>
We
shall
never
meet
again
in
this
world
.
<EOS>
""Unless
I
succeed
,
"
said
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
succeed
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
thought
so
,
I
should
not
take
this
step
.
<EOS>
I
look
upon
it
as
an
espousal
with
the
dead
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
hurried
away
,
and
disappearing
beneath
the
covert
,
returned
in
a
few
seconds
with
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"I
have
a
strange
duty
to
perform
for
you
,
my
son
,
"
said
Garnet
to
Fawkes
,
who
remained
motionless
and
stupified
;
"
but
I
am
right
willing
to
perform
it
,
because
I
think
it
will
lead
to
your
future
happiness
with
the
fair
creature
who
has
bestowed
her
affections
on
you
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
speculate
on
the
future
,
father
,
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
whyI
asked
you
to
perform
this
ceremony
.
<EOS>
You
know
,
also
,
that
I
have
made
preparations
for
instant
departure
;
and
that
I
indulge
no
hope
of
seeing
Guy
Fawkes
again
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
this
I
know
,
dear
daughter
,
"
returned
Garnet
;
"
but
,
in
spite
of
your
anticipations
of
ill
,
I
still
hope
that
your
union
may
prove
auspicious
.
<EOS>
""I
take
you
to
witness
,
father
,
"
said
Viviana
,
"
that
in
bestowing
my
hand
upon
Guy
Fawkes
,
I
bestow
at
the
same
time
all
my
possessions
upon
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
free
to
use
them
as
he
thinks
proper,—even
in
the
furtherance
of
his
design
against
the
state
,
which
,
though
I
can
not
approve
it
,
seems
good
to
him
.
<EOS>
""This
must
not
be
,
"
cried
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"It
shall
be
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Proceed
with
the
ceremony
,
father
.
""Let
<EOS>
her
have
her
own
way
,
my
son
,
"
observed
Garnet
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Under
any
circumstances
,
her
estates
must
now
be
necessarily
yours
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
took
a
breviary
from
his
vest
,
and
placing
them
near
each
other
,
began
to
read
aloud
the
marriage
-
service
appointed
by
the
Romish
Church
.
<EOS>
And
there
,
in
that
secluded
spot
,
and
under
such
extraordinary
circumstances
,
with
no
other
witnesses
than
the
ancient
trees
around
them
,
and
the
brook
rippling
at
their
feet
,
were
Guy
Fawkes
and
Viviana
united
.
<EOS>
The
ceremony
over
,
Guy
Fawkes
pressed
his
bride
to
his
breast
,
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
her
lips
.
<EOS>
"I
have
broken
my
faith
to
Heaven
,
to
which
I
was
first
espoused
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
"
she
returned
;
"
you
will
now
return
to
your
first
and
holiest
choice
.
<EOS>
Think
of
me
only
as
I
shall
think
of
you,—as
of
the
dead
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
the
party
slowly
and
silently
returned
to
the
house
,
where
they
found
a
couple
of
steeds
,
with
luggage
strapped
to
the
saddles
,
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Father
Oldcorne
was
already
mounted
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
Viviana
was
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Before
her
departure
,
she
bade
Guy
Fawkes
a
tender
farewell
;
and
at
this
trying
juncture
her
firmness
nearly
deserted
her
.
<EOS>
But
rousing
herself
,
she
sprang
upon
her
horse
,
and
urging
the
animal
into
a
quick
pace
,
and
followed
by
Oldcorne
,
she
speedily
disappeared
from
view
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
watched
her
out
of
sight
,
and
shunning
the
regards
of
Catesby
,
who
formed
one
of
the
group
,
struck
into
the
forest
,
and
was
not
seen
again
till
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
The
tenth
of
October
having
arrived
,
Guy
Fawkes
and
Catesby
repaired
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
But
the
night
passed
,
and
Tresham
did
not
appear
.
<EOS>
Catesby
was
angry
and
disappointed
,
and
could
not
conceal
his
apprehensions
of
treachery
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
took
a
different
view
of
the
matter
,
and
thought
it
not
improbable
that
their
confederate
's
absence
might
be
occasioned
by
the
difficulty
he
found
in
complying
with
their
demands
;
and
this
opinion
was
confirmed
the
next
morning
by
the
arrival
of
a
letter
from
Tresham
,
stating
that
he
had
been
utterly
unable
to
effect
the
sales
he
contemplated
,
and
could
not
,
therefore
,
procure
the
money
till
the
end
of
the
month
.
<EOS>
"I
will
immediately
go
down
to
Rushton
,
"
said
Catesby
,
"
and
if
I
find
him
disposed
to
palter
with
us
,
I
will
call
him
to
instant
account
.
<EOS>
But
Garnet
informs
me
that
Viviana
has
bestowed
all
her
wealth
upon
you
.
<EOS>
Are
you
willing
to
devote
it
to
the
good
cause?""No
!
<EOS>
"
replied
Fawkes
,
in
a
tone
so
decisive
that
his
companion
felt
it
would
be
useless
to
urge
the
matter
further
.
<EOS>
"
I
give
my
life
to
the
cause,—that
must
suffice
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
subject
was
never
renewed
.
<EOS>
At
night
,
Catesby
,
having
procured
a
powerful
steed
,
set
out
upon
his
journey
to
Northamptonshire
,
while
Fawkes
returned
to
White
Webbs
.
<EOS>
About
a
fortnight
passed
unmarked
by
any
event
of
importance
.
<EOS>
Despatches
were
received
from
Catesby
,
stating
that
he
had
received
the
money
from
Tresham
,
and
had
expended
it
in
procuring
horses
and
arms
.
<EOS>
He
also
added
that
he
had
raised
numerous
recruits
on
various
pretences
.
<EOS>
This
letter
was
dated
from
Ashby
St.
Leger
's
,
the
seat
of
his
mother
,
Lady
Catesby
,
but
he
expressed
his
intention
of
proceeding
to
Coughton
Hall
,
near
Alcester
,
in
Warwickshire
,
the
residence
of
Mr.
Thomas
Throckmorton
(
a
wealthy
Catholic
gentleman
)
,
whither
Sir
Everard
Digby
had
removed
with
his
family
,
to
be
in
readiness
for
the
grand
hunting
-
party
to
be
held
on
the
fifth
of
November
on
Dunsmore
Heath
.
<EOS>
Here
he
expected
to
be
joined
by
the
two
Wrights
,
the
Winters
,
Rookwood
,
Keyes
,
and
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
,
and
undertook
to
bring
them
all
up
to
White
Webbs
on
Saturday
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
October
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Guy
Fawkes
had
in
a
great
degree
recovered
his
equanimity
,
and
left
alone
with
Garnet
,
held
long
and
frequent
religious
conferences
with
him
;
it
being
evidently
his
desire
to
prepare
himself
for
his
expected
fate
.
<EOS>
He
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
nights
in
solitary
vigils
—
fasted
even
more
rigorously
than
he
was
enjoined
to
do
—
and
prayed
with
such
fervour
and
frequency
,
that
,
fearing
an
ill
effect
upon
his
health
,
and
almost
upon
his
mind
,
which
had
become
exalted
to
the
highest
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
Garnet
thought
it
necessary
to
check
him
.
<EOS>
The
priest
did
not
fail
to
note
that
Viviana
's
name
never
passed
his
lips
,
and
that
in
all
their
walks
in
the
forest
he
carefully
shunned
the
scene
of
his
espousals
.
<EOS>
And
thus
time
flew
by
.
<EOS>
On
the
evening
of
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
October
,
in
accordance
with
Catesby
's
intimation
,
the
conspirators
arrived
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
assembled
at
supper
,
and
were
relating
the
different
arrangements
which
had
been
made
in
anticipation
of
the
important
event
,
when
Garnet
observed
with
a
look
of
sudden
uneasiness
to
Catesby
,
"
You
said
in
one
of
your
letters
that
you
would
bring
Tresham
with
you
,
my
son
.
<EOS>
Why
do
I
not
see
him?""He
sent
a
message
to
Coughton
to
state
,
that
having
been
attacked
by
a
sudden
illness
,
he
was
unable
to
join
us
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
but
as
soon
as
he
could
leave
his
bed
,
he
would
hasten
to
London
.
<EOS>
This
may
be
a
subterfuge
,
but
I
shall
speedily
ascertain
the
truth
,
for
I
have
sent
my
servant
Bates
to
Rushton
,
to
investigate
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
ought
to
tell
you
,
"
he
added
,
"
that
he
has
given
substantial
proof
of
his
devotion
to
the
cause
by
sending
another
thousand
pounds
,
to
be
expended
in
the
purchase
of
arms
and
horses
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
it
is
not
dust
thrown
into
our
eyes
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
always
feared
Tresham
would
deceive
us
at
the
last
.
<EOS>
""This
<EOS>
sudden
illness
looks
suspicious
,
I
must
own
,
"
said
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
Has
aught
been
heard
of
Lord
Mounteagle?""Guy
Fawkes
<EOS>
heard
that
he
was
at
his
residence
at
Southwark
yesterday
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
far
,
good
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
visit
the
cellar
where
the
powder
is
deposited
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
turning
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
did
,
"
replied
the
other
,
"
and
found
all
secure
.
<EOS>
The
powder
is
in
excellent
preservation
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
the
spot
,
I
placed
certain
private
marks
against
the
door
,
by
which
I
can
tell
whether
it
is
opened
during
our
absence
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
wise
precaution
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
added
,
filling
a
goblet
with
wine
,
"
success
to
our
enterprise
!
<EOS>
Everything
is
prepared
,
"
he
continued
,
as
the
pledge
was
enthusiastically
drunk
;
"
I
have
got
together
a
company
of
above
two
hundred
men
,
all
well
armed
and
appointed
,
who
will
follow
me
wherever
I
choose
to
lead
them
.
<EOS>
They
will
be
stationed
near
Dunsmore
Heath
on
the
fifth
of
next
month
,
and
as
soon
as
the
event
of
the
explosion
is
known
,
I
shall
ride
thither
as
fast
as
I
can
,
and
,
hurrying
with
my
troops
to
Coventry
,
seize
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
Percy
and
Keyes
will
secure
the
person
of
the
Duke
of
York
,
and
proclaim
him
King
;
while
upon
the
rest
will
devolve
the
arduous
duty
of
rousing
our
Catholic
brethren
in
London
to
rise
to
arms
.
<EOS>
""Trust
<EOS>
to
us
to
rouse
them
,
"
shouted
several
voices
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
each
man
swear
not
to
swerve
from
the
fulfilment
of
his
task
,
"
cried
Catesby
;
"
swear
it
upon
this
cup
of
wine
,
in
which
we
will
all
mix
our
blood
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
,
he
pricked
his
arm
with
the
point
of
his
sword
,
and
suffered
a
few
drops
of
blood
to
fall
into
the
goblet
,
while
the
others
,
roused
to
a
state
of
frenzied
enthusiasm
,
imitated
his
example
,
and
afterwards
raised
the
horrible
mixture
to
their
lips
,
pronouncing
at
the
same
time
the
oath
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
the
last
to
take
the
pledge
,
and
crying
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
I
swear
not
to
quit
my
post
till
the
explosion
is
over
,
"
he
drained
the
cup
.
<EOS>
After
this
,
they
adjourned
to
a
room
in
another
wing
of
the
house
,
fitted
up
as
a
chapel
,
where
mass
was
performed
by
Garnet
,
and
the
sacrament
administered
to
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
They
were
about
to
retire
for
the
night
,
when
a
sudden
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Reconnoitring
the
intruder
through
an
upper
window
,
overlooking
the
court
,
Catesby
perceived
it
was
Bates
,
who
was
holding
a
smoking
and
mud
-
bespattered
steed
by
the
bridle
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
what
news
do
you
bring
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
as
he
admitted
him
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
seen
Tresham?""No
,
"
replied
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
illness
was
a
mere
pretence
.
<EOS>
He
has
left
Rushton
secretly
for
London
.
<EOS>
""I
knew
it
,
"
cried
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
again
betrayed
us
.
<EOS>
""He
shall
die
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
And
the
determination
was
echoed
by
all
the
other
conspirators
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
retiring
to
rest
,
they
passed
the
night
in
anxious
deliberation
,
and
it
was
at
last
proposed
that
Guy
Fawkes
should
proceed
without
loss
of
time
to
Southwark
,
to
keep
watch
near
the
house
of
Lord
Mounteagle
,
and
if
possible
ascertain
whether
Tresham
had
visited
it
.
<EOS>
To
this
he
readily
agreed
.
<EOS>
But
before
setting
out
,
he
took
Catesby
aside
for
a
moment
,
and
asked
,
"
Did
you
see
Viviana
at
Coughton?""Only
for
a
moment
,
and
that
just
before
I
left
the
place
,
"
was
the
answer
.
"
<EOS>
She
desired
to
be
remembered
to
you
,
and
said
you
were
never
absent
from
her
thoughts
or
prayers
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
turned
away
to
hide
his
emotion
,
and
mounting
one
of
the
horses
brought
by
the
conspirators
,
rode
off
towards
London
.

<EOS>
—
THE
FIFTH
OF
NOVEMBEROn
the
same
day
as
the
occurrences
last
related
,
Lord
Mounteagle
,
who
was
then
staying
at
Southwark
,
suddenly
intimated
his
intention
of
passing
the
night
at
his
country
mansion
at
Hoxton
;
a
change
of
place
which
,
trivial
as
it
seemed
at
the
moment
,
afterwards
assumed
an
importance
,
from
the
circumstances
that
arose
out
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
the
latter
part
of
the
day
,
he
accordingly
proceeded
to
Hoxton
,
accompanied
by
his
customary
attendants
,
and
all
appeared
to
pass
on
as
usual
,
until
,
just
as
supper
was
over
,
one
of
his
pages
arrived
from
town
,
and
desired
to
see
his
lordship
immediately
.
<EOS>
Affecting
to
treat
the
matter
with
indifference
,
Lord
Mounteagle
carelessly
ordered
the
youth
to
be
ushered
into
his
presence
;
and
when
he
appeared
,
he
demanded
his
business
.
<EOS>
The
page
replied
,
that
he
brought
a
letter
for
his
lordship
,
which
had
been
delivered
under
circumstances
of
great
mystery
.
<EOS>
"I
had
left
the
house
just
as
it
grew
dusk
,
"
he
said
,
"
on
an
errand
of
little
importance
,
when
a
man
,
muffled
in
a
cloak
,
suddenly
issued
from
behind
a
corner
,
and
demanded
whether
I
was
one
of
your
lordship
's
servants
?
<EOS>
On
my
replying
in
the
affirmative
,
he
produced
this
letter
,
and
enjoined
me
,
as
I
valued
my
life
and
your
lordship
's
safety
,
to
deliver
it
into
your
own
hands
without
delay
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
delivered
the
letter
to
his
lord
,
who
,
gazing
at
its
address
,
which
was
,
"
To
the
Right
Honourable
<EOS>
the
Lord
Mounteagle
,
"
observed
,
"
There
is
nothing
very
formidable
in
its
appearance
.
<EOS>
What
can
it
mean?"Without
even
breaking
the
seal
,
which
was
secured
with
a
silken
thread
,
he
gave
it
to
one
of
his
gentlemen
,
named
Ward
,
who
was
standing
near
him
.
<EOS>
"Read
it
<EOS>
aloud
,
sir
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
with
a
slight
smile
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
doubt
it
is
some
vapouring
effusion
,
which
will
afford
us
occasion
for
laughter
.
<EOS>
Before
I
hear
what
the
writer
has
to
say
,
I
can
promise
him
he
shall
not
intimidate
me
.
<EOS>
"Thus
exhorted
,
Ward
broken
open
the
letter
,
and
read
as
follows:—"My
lord
,
out
of
the
love
I
bear
to
some
of
your
friends
,
I
have
a
care
of
your
preservation
.
<EOS>
Therefore
I
would
advise
you
,
as
you
tender
your
life
,
to
devise
some
excuse
to
shift
from
your
attendance
at
this
Parliament
,
for
God
and
man
have
concurred
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
this
time
.
<EOS>
Think
not
slightingly
of
this
advice
,
but
retire
into
the
country
,
where
you
may
expect
the
event
in
safety
;
for
,
though
there
be
no
appearance
of
any
stir
,
yet
I
say
they
shall
receive
a
terrible
blow
this
Parliament
,
and
yet
they
shall
not
know
who
hurts
them
.
<EOS>
This
counsel
is
not
to
be
contemned
.
<EOS>
It
may
do
you
good
,
and
can
do
you
no
harm
,
for
the
danger
is
passed
as
soon
as
you
have
burned
the
letter
.
<EOS>
God
,
I
hope
,
will
give
you
grace
to
make
good
use
of
it
,
to
whose
holy
protection
<EOS>
I
commend
you
.
<EOS>
""A
singular
letter
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mounteagle
,
as
soon
as
Ward
had
finished
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
opinion
of
it?""I
think
it
hints
at
some
dangerous
plot
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Ward
,
who
had
received
his
instructions
,
"
some
treason
against
the
state
.
<EOS>
With
submission
,
I
would
advise
your
lordship
instantly
to
take
it
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
""I
see
nothing
in
it
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
opinion
,
Mervyn
?
"
he
added
,
turning
to
another
of
his
gentlemen
,
to
whom
he
had
likewise
given
his
lesson
.
<EOS>
"I
am
of
the
same
mind
as
Ward
,
"
replied
the
attendant
.
<EOS>
"Your
lordship
will
hardly
hold
yourself
excused
,
if
you
neglect
to
give
due
warning
,
should
aught
occur
hereafter
.
<EOS>
""Say
<EOS>
you
so
,
sirs
?
"
cried
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
hear
it
once
more
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
letter
was
accordingly
read
again
by
Ward
,
and
the
Earl
feigned
to
weigh
over
each
passage
.
<EOS>
"I
am
advised
not
to
attend
the
Parliament
,
"
he
said
,
"
'
for
God
and
man
have
concurred
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
this
time
.
'
<EOS>
That
is
too
vague
to
be
regarded
.
<EOS>
Then
I
am
urged
to
retire
into
the
country
.
<EOS>
The
recommendation
must
proceed
from
some
discontented
Catholic
,
who
does
not
wish
me
to
be
present
at
the
opening
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
This
is
not
the
first
time
I
have
been
so
adjured
.
'
<EOS>
They
shall
receive
a
terrible
blow
this
Parliament
,
and
yet
shall
not
know
who
hurts
them
.
'
<EOS>
That
is
mysterious
enough
,
but
it
may
mean
nothing,—any
more
than
what
follows
,
namely
,
'
the
danger
is
passed
as
soon
as
you
have
burnt
the
letter
.
<EOS>
'""I
<EOS>
do
not
think
so
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Ward
;
"
and
though
I
can
not
explain
the
riddle
,
I
am
sure
it
means
mischief
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
said
Lord
Mounteagle
,
"
since
you
are
of
this
mind
,
I
must
lose
no
time
in
communicating
the
letter
to
the
Secretary
of
State
.
<EOS>
It
is
better
to
err
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
<EOS>
,
after
some
further
consultation
,
he
set
out
at
that
late
hour
for
Whitehall
,
where
he
roused
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
and
showed
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
It
is
almost
needless
to
state
that
the
whole
was
a
preconcerted
scheme
between
these
two
crafty
statesmen
;
but
as
the
interview
took
place
in
the
presence
of
their
attendants
,
the
utmost
caution
was
observed
.
<EOS>
Salisbury
pretended
to
be
greatly
alarmed
at
the
communication
,
and
coupling
it
,
he
said
,
with
previous
intelligence
which
he
had
received
,
he
could
not
help
fearing
,
to
adopt
the
words
of
the
writer
of
the
mysterious
letter
,
that
the
Parliament
was
indeed
threatened
with
some
"
terrible
blow
.
<EOS>
"
Acting
,
apparently
,
upon
this
supposition
,
he
caused
such
of
the
lords
of
the
Privy
Council
as
lodged
at
Whitehall
to
be
summoned
,
and
submitting
the
letter
to
them
,
they
all
concurred
in
the
opinion
that
it
referred
to
some
dangerous
plot
,
though
none
could
give
a
guess
at
its
precise
nature
.
<EOS>
"It
is
clearly
some
Popish
project
,
"
said
Salisbury
,
"
or
Lord
Mounteagle
would
not
have
been
the
party
warned
.
<EOS>
We
must
keep
a
look
-
out
upon
the
disaffected
of
his
faith
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
I
have
been
the
means
of
revealing
the
plot
to
your
lordship
—
if
plot
it
be
—
I
must
pray
you
to
deal
gently
with
them
,
"
rejoined
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"I
will
be
as
lenient
as
I
can
,
"
returned
Salisbury
;
"
but
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
little
favour
can
be
shown
.
<EOS>
If
your
lordship
will
enable
me
to
discover
the
principal
actors
in
this
affair
,
I
will
take
care
that
no
innocent
party
suffers
.
<EOS>
""You
ask
an
impossibility
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
beyond
what
can
be
gathered
from
that
letter
.
<EOS>
But
I
pray
your
lordship
not
to
make
it
a
means
of
exercising
unnecessary
severity
towards
the
members
of
my
religion
.
<EOS>
""On
that
you
may
rely
,
"
returned
the
Earl
.
"
<EOS>
His
Majesty
will
not
return
from
the
hunting
expedition
on
which
he
is
engaged
at
Royston
till
Thursday
next
,
the
30th
.
<EOS>
I
think
it
scarcely
worth
while
(
considering
his
naturally
timid
nature
,
with
which
your
lordships
are
well
acquainted
)
to
inform
him
of
the
threatened
danger
,
until
his
arrival
at
the
palace
.
<EOS>
It
will
then
be
time
enough
to
take
any
needful
steps
,
as
Parliament
will
not
meet
for
four
or
five
days
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
policy
of
this
course
the
Privy
Councillors
agreed
,
and
it
was
arranged
that
the
matter
should
be
kept
perfectly
secret
until
the
King
's
opinion
had
been
taken
upon
the
letter
.
<EOS>
The
assemblage
then
broke
up
,
it
being
previously
arranged
that
,
for
fear
of
some
attempt
upon
his
life
,
Lord
Mounteagle
should
remain
within
the
palace
till
full
inquiries
had
been
instituted
into
the
affair
.
<EOS>
When
the
two
confederate
nobles
were
left
alone
,
Salisbury
observed
,
with
a
slight
laugh
,
to
his
companion,"Thus
far
we
have
proceeded
well
,
and
without
suspicion
,
and
,
rely
upon
it
<EOS>
,
none
shall
fall
on
you
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
all
is
over
,
the
most
important
post
the
King
has
to
bestow
shall
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
what
of
Tresham
?
"
asked
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
was
the
deliverer
of
this
letter
,
and
I
have
little
faith
in
him
.
<EOS>
""Hum
!
"
said
Salisbury
,
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
"
if
you
think
it
desirable
,
we
can
remove
him
to
the
Tower
,
where
he
can
be
easily
silenced
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
better
so
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
may
else
babble
hereafter
.
<EOS>
I
gave
him
a
thousand
pounds
to
send
in
his
own
name
to
the
conspirators
the
other
day
to
lure
them
into
our
nets
.
<EOS>
""It
<EOS>
shall
be
repaid
you
a
hundred
-
fold
,
"
replied
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
But
we
are
observed
,
and
must
therefore
separate
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
withdrew
to
his
own
chamber
,
while
Lord
Mounteagle
was
ushered
to
the
apartments
allotted
to
him
.
<EOS>
To
return
to
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
Southwark
,
he
stationed
himself
near
Lord
Mounteagle
's
residence
.
<EOS>
But
he
observed
nothing
to
awaken
his
suspicions
,
until
early
in
the
morning
he
perceived
a
page
approaching
the
mansion
,
whom
,
from
his
livery
,
he
knew
to
be
one
of
Lord
Mounteagle
's
household
,
(
it
was
,
in
fact
,
the
very
youth
who
had
delivered
the
mysterious
letter
,
)
and
from
him
he
ascertained
all
that
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
alarm
,
and
scarcely
knowing
what
to
do
,
he
crossed
the
river
,
and
proceeding
to
the
cellar
,
examined
the
marks
at
the
door
,
and
finding
all
precisely
as
he
had
left
it
,
felt
certain
,
that
whatever
discovery
had
been
made
,
the
magazine
had
not
been
visited
.
<EOS>
He
next
repaired
to
the
house
,
of
which
he
possessed
the
key
,
and
was
satisfied
that
no
one
had
been
there
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
relieved
by
this
,
he
yet
determined
to
keep
watch
during
the
day
,
and
concealing
himself
near
the
cellar
,
remained
on
the
look
-
out
till
night
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
came
;
nor
did
anything
occur
to
excite
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
,
however
,
quit
his
post
till
about
six
o'clock
on
the
following
evening
,
when
,
thinking
further
delay
might
be
attended
with
danger
,
he
set
out
to
White
Webbs
,
to
give
his
companions
intelligence
of
the
letter
.
<EOS>
His
news
was
received
by
all
with
the
greatest
alarm
,
and
not
one
,
except
Catesby
,
who
strove
to
put
a
bold
face
upon
the
matter
,
though
he
was
full
of
inward
misgiving
,
but
confessed
that
he
thought
all
chance
of
success
was
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
While
deliberating
upon
what
should
be
done
in
this
fearful
emergency
,
they
were
greatly
alarmed
by
a
sudden
knocking
without
.
<EOS>
All
the
conspirators
concealed
themselves
,
except
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
opening
the
door
,
found
,
to
his
infinite
surprise
,
that
the
summons
proceeded
from
Tresham
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
till
the
other
had
entered
the
house
,
and
then
suddenly
drawing
his
dagger
,
held
it
to
his
throat
.
<EOS>
"Make
<EOS>
your
shrift
quickly
,
traitor
,
"
he
cried
in
a
furious
tone
,
"
for
your
last
hour
is
arrived
.
<EOS>
What
ho
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
to
the
others
,
who
instantly
issued
from
their
hiding
-
places
,
"
the
fox
has
ventured
into
the
lion
's
den
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
distrust
me
wrongfully
,
"
rejoined
Tresham
,
with
more
confidence
than
he
usually
exhibited
in
time
of
danger
;
"
I
am
come
to
warn
you
,
not
betray
you
.
<EOS>
Is
this
the
return
you
make
me
for
the
service?""Villain
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
rushing
up
to
him
,
and
holding
his
drawn
sword
to
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
conveyed
the
letter
to
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
""It
is
false
,
"
replied
Tresham
;
"
<EOS>
I
have
only
just
heard
of
it
;
and
,
in
spite
of
the
risk
I
knew
I
should
run
from
your
suspicions
,
I
came
to
tell
you
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
did
you
feign
illness
,
and
depart
secretly
for
town
,
instead
of
joining
us
at
Coughton
?
"
demanded
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"I
will
instantly
explain
my
motive
,
which
,
though
it
may
not
be
satisfactory
to
you
on
one
point
,
will
be
so
on
another
,
"
replied
Tresham
unhesitatingly
,
and
with
apparent
frankness
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
fearful
you
would
make
a
further
tool
of
me
,
and
resolved
not
to
join
you
again
till
a
few
days
before
the
outbreak
of
the
plot
.
<EOS>
To
this
determination
I
should
have
adhered
,
had
I
not
learnt
to
-
night
that
a
letter
had
been
transmitted
by
some
one
to
Lord
Mounteagle
,
which
he
had
conveyed
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
It
may
not
convey
any
notion
of
the
plot
,
but
it
is
certain
to
occasion
alarm
,
and
I
thought
it
my
duty
,
in
spite
of
every
personal
consideration
,
to
give
you
warning
.
<EOS>
If
you
design
to
escape
,
there
is
yet
time
.
<EOS>
A
vessel
lies
in
the
river
,
in
which
we
can
all
embark
for
Flanders
.
<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
he
be
innocent
?
"
said
Catesby
in
a
whisper
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"If
I
had
betrayed
you
,
"
continued
Tresham
,
"
I
should
not
have
come
hither
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
motive
for
such
baseness
,
for
I
am
in
equal
danger
with
yourselves
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
alarm
has
been
given
,
I
do
not
think
any
discovery
will
be
made
.
<EOS>
They
are
evidently
on
the
wrong
scent
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
I
fear
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
""Shall
<EOS>
I
put
him
to
death
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Fawkes
of
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
sully
your
hands
with
his
blood
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
betrayed
us
,
he
will
reap
the
traitor
's
reward
here
and
hereafter
.
<EOS>
If
he
has
not
,
it
would
be
to
take
away
a
life
unjustly
.
<EOS>
Let
him
depart
.
<EOS>
We
shall
feel
more
secure
without
him
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
it
be
safe
to
set
him
free
,
father
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"I
think
so
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
admit
him
to
our
further
conferences
;
but
let
us
act
mercifully
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
major
part
of
the
conspirators
concurring
in
this
opinion
,
though
Fawkes
and
Catesby
were
opposed
to
it
,
Tresham
was
suffered
to
depart
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Garnet
avowed
that
the
further
prosecution
of
the
design
appeared
so
hazardous
,
that
it
ought
to
be
abandoned
,
and
that
,
in
his
opinion
,
each
of
the
conspirators
had
better
consult
his
own
safety
by
flight
.
<EOS>
He
added
,
that
at
some
future
period
the
design
might
be
resumed
,
or
another
planned
,
which
might
be
more
securely
carried
out
.
<EOS>
After
much
discussion
,
all
seemed
disposed
to
acquiesce
in
the
proposal
,
except
Fawkes
,
who
adhered
doggedly
to
his
purpose
,
and
treated
the
danger
so
slightingly
,
that
he
gradually
brought
the
others
round
to
his
views
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
it
was
resolved
that
Garnet
should
set
out
immediately
for
Coughton
Hall
,
and
place
himself
under
the
protection
of
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
and
there
await
the
result
of
the
attempt
,
while
the
other
conspirators
decided
upon
remaining
in
town
,
in
some
secure
places
of
concealment
,
until
the
event
was
known
.
<EOS>
Unmoved
as
ever
,
Guy
Fawkes
declared
his
intention
of
watching
over
the
magazine
of
powder
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
anything
happens
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
will
take
care
of
yourselves
.
<EOS>
You
well
know
nothing
will
be
wrung
from
me
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
<EOS>
and
the
others
,
aware
of
his
resolute
nature
,
affected
to
remonstrate
with
him
,
but
they
willingly
suffered
him
to
take
his
own
course
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
Bates
,
Garnet
then
set
out
for
Warwickshire
,
and
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
proceeded
to
London
,
where
they
dispersed
,
after
appointing
Lincoln
's
Inn
Walks
as
their
place
of
midnight
rendezvous
.
<EOS>
Each
then
made
preparations
for
sudden
flight
,
in
case
it
should
be
necessary
,
and
Rookwood
provided
relays
of
horses
all
the
way
to
Dunchurch
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
alone
remained
at
his
post
.
<EOS>
He
took
up
his
abode
in
the
cellar
,
resolved
to
blow
up
himself
together
with
his
foes
,
in
case
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
On
Thursday
,
the
31st
of
October
,
the
King
returned
to
Whitehall
,
and
the
mysterious
letter
was
laid
before
him
in
the
presence
of
the
Privy
Council
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
James
perused
it
carefully
,
but
could
scarcely
hide
his
perplexity
.
<EOS>
"Your
Majesty
will
not
fail
to
remark
the
expressions
,
'
a
terrible
blow
'
to
the
Parliament
,
and
'
that
the
danger
will
be
past
as
soon
as
you
have
burnt
the
letter
,
'
evidently
referring
to
combustion
,
"
observed
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"You
are
right
,
Salisbury
,
"
said
James
,
snatching
at
the
suggestion
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
not
wonder
if
these
mischievous
Papists
mean
to
blow
us
all
up
with
gunpowder
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
Majesty
has
received
a
divine
illumination
,
"
returned
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
Such
an
idea
never
occurred
to
me
;
but
it
must
be
as
you
intimate
.
<EOS>
""Undoubtedly
<EOS>
—
undoubtedly
,
"
replied
the
monarch
,
pleased
with
the
compliment
to
his
sagacity
,
though
alarmed
by
the
danger
;
"
but
what
desperate
traitors
they
must
be
to
imagine
such
a
deed
!
<EOS>
Blow
us
up
!
<EOS>
God
's
mercy
,
that
were
a
dreadful
death
!
<EOS>
And
yet
that
must
evidently
be
the
meaning
of
the
passage
.
<EOS>
How
else
can
it
be
construed
,
except
by
reference
to
the
suddenness
of
the
act
,
which
might
be
as
quickly
performed
as
that
paper
would
take
to
be
consumed
in
the
fire?""Your
Majesty
's
penetration
has
discovered
the
truth
,
"
replied
Salisbury
,
"
and
by
the
help
of
your
wisdom
,
I
will
fully
develop
this
dark
design
.
<EOS>
Where
,
think
you
,
the
powder
may
lie
hidden?""Are
there
any
vaults
beneath
the
Parliament
House
?
"
demanded
James
,
trembling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
save
us
!
<EOS>
We
have
often
walked
there
—
perhaps
,
over
a
secret
mine
.
<EOS>
""There
are
,
"
replied
Salisbury
;
"
and
I
am
again
indebted
to
your
Majesty
for
a
most
important
suggestion
.
<EOS>
Not
a
corner
in
the
vaults
shall
be
left
unsearched
.
<EOS>
But
,
perhaps
you
will
think
with
me
,
that
,
in
order
to
catch
these
traitors
in
their
own
trap
,
it
will
be
well
to
defer
the
search
till
the
very
night
before
the
meeting
of
Parliament
.
<EOS>
""I
was
about
to
recommend
such
a
course
myself
,
Salisbury
,
"
replied
James
.
<EOS>
"I
was
sure
you
would
think
so
,
"
returned
the
Earl
;
"
and
now
I
must
entreat
you
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
your
thoughts
,
and
to
sleep
securely
;
for
you
may
rely
upon
it
(
after
your
Majesty
's
discovery
)
that
the
plot
shall
be
fully
unravelled
.
<EOS>
"The
significant
tone
in
which
the
Earl
uttered
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
convinced
the
King
that
he
knew
more
of
the
matter
than
he
cared
to
confess
;
and
he
contented
himself
with
saying
,
"
Well
,
let
it
be
so
.
<EOS>
I
trust
all
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
at
once
divined
their
purpose,—I
at
once
divined
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Council
then
broke
up
,
and
James
laughed
and
chuckled
to
himself
at
the
discernment
he
had
displayed
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
less
pleased
with
his
minister
for
the
credit
given
him
in
the
affair
.
<EOS>
But
he
took
care
not
to
enter
the
Parliament
House
.
<EOS>
On
the
afternoon
of
Monday
,
the
4th
of
November
,
the
Lord
Chamberlain
,
accompanied
by
the
Lords
Salisbury
and
Mounteagle
,
visited
the
cellars
and
vaults
beneath
the
Parliament
House
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
they
discovered
nothing
to
excite
suspicion
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
probably
at
the
suggestion
of
Lord
Mounteagle
,
who
,
as
will
be
recollected
,
was
acquainted
with
the
situation
of
the
magazine
,
they
proceeded
to
the
cellar
,
where
they
found
the
store
of
powder
;
but
not
meeting
with
any
of
the
conspirators
,
as
they
expected
,
they
disturbed
nothing
,
and
went
away
,
reporting
the
result
of
their
search
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
By
the
recommendation
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
James
advised
that
a
guard
should
be
placed
near
the
cellar
during
the
whole
of
the
night
,
consisting
of
Topcliffe
and
a
certain
number
of
attendants
,
and
headed
by
Sir
Thomas
Knevet
,
a
magistrate
of
Westminster
,
upon
whose
courage
and
discretion
full
reliance
could
be
placed
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mounteagle
also
requested
permission
to
keep
guard
with
them
to
witness
the
result
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
To
this
the
King
assented
,
and
as
soon
as
it
grew
dark
,
the
party
secretly
took
up
their
position
at
a
point
commanding
the
entrance
of
the
magazine
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
,
who
chanced
to
be
absent
at
the
time
the
search
was
made
,
returned
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
and
remained
within
the
cellar
,
seated
upon
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
,
the
head
of
which
he
had
staved
in
,
with
a
lantern
in
one
hand
,
and
petronel
in
the
other
,
till
past
midnight
.
<EOS>
The
fifth
of
November
was
now
at
hand
,
and
the
clock
of
the
adjoining
abbey
had
scarcely
ceased
tolling
the
hour
that
proclaimed
its
arrival
,
when
Fawkes
,
somewhat
wearied
with
his
solitary
watching
,
determined
to
repair
,
for
a
short
space
,
to
the
adjoining
house
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
quitted
the
cellar
,
leaving
his
lantern
lighted
within
it
in
one
corner
.
<EOS>
Opening
the
door
,
he
gazed
cautiously
around
,
but
perceiving
nothing
,
after
waiting
a
few
seconds
,
he
proceeded
to
lock
the
door
.
<EOS>
While
thus
employed
,
he
thought
he
heard
a
noise
behind
him
,
and
turning
suddenly
,
he
beheld
through
the
gloom
several
persons
rushing
towards
him
,
evidently
with
hostile
intent
.
<EOS>
His
first
impulse
was
to
draw
a
petronel
,
and
grasp
his
sword
:
<EOS>
but
before
he
could
effect
his
purpose
,
his
arms
were
pinioned
by
a
powerful
grasp
from
behind
,
while
the
light
of
a
lantern
thrown
full
in
his
face
revealed
the
barrel
of
a
petronel
levelled
at
his
head
,
and
an
authoritative
voice
commanded
him
in
the
King
's
name
to
surrender
.

<EOS>
THE
FLIGHT
OF
THE
CONSPIRATORSOn
the
same
night
,
and
at
the
same
hour
that
Guy
Fawkes
was
captured
<EOS>
,
the
other
conspirators
held
their
rendezvous
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
Walks
.
<EOS>
A
presentiment
of
the
fate
awaiting
them
filled
the
breasts
of
all
,
and
even
Catesby
shared
in
the
general
depression
.
<EOS>
Plan
after
plan
was
proposed
,
and
,
as
soon
as
proposed
,
rejected
;
and
they
seemed
influenced
only
by
alarm
and
irresolution
.
<EOS>
Feeling
at
length
that
nothing
could
be
done
,
and
that
they
were
only
increasing
their
risk
by
remaining
together
longer
,
they
agreed
to
separate
,
appointing
to
meet
at
the
same
place
on
the
following
night
,
if
their
project
should
not
,
in
the
interim
,
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
"Before
daybreak
,
"
said
Catesby
,
"
I
will
proceed
to
the
cellar
under
the
Parliament
House
,
and
ascertain
whether
anything
has
happened
to
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
My
heart
misgives
me
about
him
,
and
I
reproach
myself
that
I
have
allowed
him
to
incur
this
peril
alone
.
<EOS>
""Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
is
arrested
,
"
said
a
voice
near
them
,
"
and
is
at
this
moment
under
examination
before
the
King
.
<EOS>
""It
is
Tresham
who
speaks
,
"
cried
Catesby
;
"
secure
<EOS>
him!"The
injunction
was
instantly
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Tresham
was
seized
,
and
several
weapons
pointed
against
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
however
,
appear
to
be
dismayed
,
but
,
so
far
as
could
be
discerned
in
the
obscurity
,
seemed
to
maintain
great
boldness
of
demeanour
.
<EOS>
"I
have
again
ventured
among
you
,
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
firm
tone
,
"
to
give
you
this
most
important
intelligence
;
and
am
requited
,
as
I
have
ever
been
of
late
,
with
menaces
and
violence
.
<EOS>
Stab
me
,
and
see
whether
my
death
will
avail
you
in
this
extremity
.
<EOS>
I
am
in
equal
danger
with
yourselves
;
and
whether
I
perish
by
your
hands
,
or
by
those
of
the
executioner
,
is
of
little
moment
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
question
him
before
we
avenge
ourselves
upon
him
,
"
said
Catesby
to
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
"
How
do
you
know
that
Guy
Fawkes
is
a
prisoner?""I
saw
him
taken
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
"
and
esteem
myself
singularly
fortunate
that
I
escaped
the
same
fate
.
<EOS>
Though
excluded
from
further
share
in
the
project
,
I
could
not
divest
myself
of
a
strong
desire
to
know
how
matters
were
going
on
,
and
I
resolved
to
visit
the
cellar
secretly
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
As
I
stealthily
approached
it
,
I
remarked
several
armed
figures
beneath
a
gateway
,
and
conjecturing
their
purpose
,
instantly
concealed
myself
behind
a
projection
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
in
this
situation
many
minutes
,
when
the
cellar
door
opened
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
issued
from
it
.
<EOS>
""Well
!
"
cried
Catesby
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
party
<EOS>
I
had
noticed
immediately
rushed
forward
,
and
secured
him
before
he
could
offer
any
resistance
,
"
continued
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
After
a
brief
struggle
,
certain
of
their
number
dragged
him
into
the
cellar
,
while
others
kept
watch
without
.
<EOS>
I
should
now
have
flown
,
but
my
limbs
refused
their
office
,
and
I
was
therefore
compelled
,
however
reluctantly
,
to
see
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
Guy
Fawkes
was
brought
forth
again
,
and
I
heard
some
one
in
authority
give
directions
that
he
should
be
instantly
taken
to
Whitehall
,
to
be
interrogated
before
the
King
and
the
Privy
Council
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
led
away
,
and
a
guard
placed
at
the
door
of
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
Feeling
certain
I
should
be
discovered
,
I
continued
for
some
time
in
an
agony
of
apprehension
,
not
daring
to
stir
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
length
,
summoning
up
sufficient
resolution
,
I
crept
cautiously
along
the
side
of
the
wall
,
and
got
off
unperceived
.
<EOS>
My
first
object
was
to
warn
you
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
did
you
become
acquainted
with
our
place
of
rendezvous
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
elder
Wright
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
overheard
you
,
at
our
last
interview
at
White
Webbs
,
appoint
a
midnight
meeting
in
this
place
,
"
replied
Tresham
,
"
and
I
hurried
hither
in
the
hope
of
finding
you
,
and
have
not
been
disappointed
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
I
give
the
word
,
plunge
your
swords
into
his
breast
,
"
said
Catesby
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"Hold
!
"
cried
Percy
,
taking
him
aside
.
<EOS>
"
If
we
put
him
to
death
in
this
spot
,
his
body
will
be
found
,
and
his
slaughter
may
awaken
suspicions
against
us
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
will
reveal
nothing
.
<EOS>
""Of
that
I
am
well
assured
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
we
take
the
traitor
with
us
to
some
secure
retreat
,
where
we
can
detain
him
till
we
learn
what
takes
place
at
the
palace
,
and
if
we
find
he
has
betrayed
us
,
despatch
him?""That
would
answer
no
good
purpose
,
"
returned
Percy
<EOS>
"
The
sooner
we
are
rid
of
him
the
better
.
<EOS>
We
can
then
deliberate
as
to
what
is
best
to
be
done
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
has
betrayed
us
,
life
will
be
a
burthen
to
him
,
and
the
greatest
kindness
we
could
render
him
would
be
to
rid
him
of
it
.
<EOS>
Let
him
go
.
<EOS>
Tresham
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
"
you
are
free
.
<EOS>
But
we
meet
no
more
.
<EOS>
""We
have
not
parted
yet
,
"
cried
the
traitor
,
springing
backwards
,
and
uttering
a
loud
cry
.
<EOS>
"
I
arrest
you
all
in
the
King
's
name
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
signal
was
answered
by
a
band
of
soldiers
,
who
emerged
from
behind
the
trees
where
they
had
hitherto
been
concealed
,
and
instantly
surrounded
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
"It
is
now
my
turn
to
threaten
,
"
laughed
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Catesby
replied
by
drawing
a
petronel
,
and
firing
it
in
the
supposed
direction
of
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
But
he
missed
his
mark
.
<EOS>
The
ball
lodged
in
the
brain
of
a
soldier
who
was
standing
beside
him
,
and
the
ill
-
fated
wretch
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
A
desperate
conflict
now
ensued
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
,
who
commanded
the
assailing
party
,
ordered
his
followers
to
take
the
conspirators
alive
,
and
it
was
mainly
owing
to
this
injunction
that
the
latter
were
indebted
for
their
safety
.
<EOS>
Whispering
his
directions
to
his
companions
,
Catesby
gave
the
word
,
and
making
a
simultaneous
rush
forward
,
they
broke
through
the
opposing
ranks
,
and
instantly
dispersing
,
and
favoured
by
the
gloom
,
they
baffled
pursuit
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
have
failed
in
this
part
of
our
scheme
,
"
said
Tresham
to
Topcliffe
,
as
they
met
half
an
hour
afterwards
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
be
done?""We
must
take
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
advice
upon
it
,
"
returned
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
now
hasten
to
Whitehall
to
see
how
Guy
Fawkes
's
interrogation
proceeds
,
and
will
communicate
with
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
"Upon
this
,
they
separated
.
<EOS>
None
of
the
conspirators
met
again
that
night
.
<EOS>
Each
fled
in
a
different
direction
,
and
,
ignorant
of
what
had
happened
to
the
rest
,
sought
some
secure
retreat
.
<EOS>
Catesby
ran
towards
Chancery
-
lane
,
and
passing
through
a
narrow
alley
,
entered
the
large
gardens
which
then
lay
between
this
thoroughfare
and
Fetter
-
lane
.
<EOS>
Listening
to
hear
whether
he
was
pursued
,
and
finding
nothing
to
alarm
him
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
sod
beneath
a
tree
,
and
was
lost
in
painful
reflection
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
my
fair
schemes
are
marred
by
that
traitor
,
Tresham
,
"
he
muttered
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
forgive
myself
for
being
duped
by
him
,
if
I
had
slain
him
when
he
was
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
But
that
he
should
escape
to
exult
in
our
ruin
,
and
reap
the
reward
of
his
perfidy
,
afflicts
me
even
more
than
failure
.
<EOS>
"Tortured
<EOS>
by
thoughts
like
these
,
and
in
vain
endeavouring
to
snatch
such
brief
repose
as
would
fit
him
for
the
fatigue
he
might
have
to
endure
on
the
morrow
,
he
did
not
quit
his
position
till
late
in
the
morning
of
a
dull
November
day
—
it
was
,
as
will
be
recollected
,
the
memorable
Fifth
—
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
He
then
arose
,
and
slouching
his
hat
,
and
wrapping
his
cloak
around
him
,
shaped
his
course
towards
Fleet
-
street
.
<EOS>
From
the
knots
of
persons
gathered
together
at
different
corners,—from
their
muttered
discourse
and
mysterious
looks
,
as
well
as
from
the
general
excitement
that
prevailed,—he
felt
sure
that
some
rumour
of
the
plot
had
gone
abroad
.
<EOS>
Shunning
observation
as
much
as
he
could
,
he
entered
a
small
tavern
near
Fleet
Bridge
,
and
called
for
a
flask
of
wine
and
some
food
.
<EOS>
While
discussing
these
,
he
was
attracted
by
the
discourse
of
the
landlord
,
who
was
conversing
with
his
guests
about
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
"I
hear
that
all
the
Papists
are
to
be
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
,
"
cried
the
host
;
"
and
if
it
be
true
,
as
I
have
heard
,
that
this
plot
is
their
contrivance
,
they
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
no
believer
in
that
faith
—
no
recusant
in
my
house
.
<EOS>
""Don't
<EOS>
insult
us
by
any
such
suspicion
<EOS>
,
"
cried
one
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
all
loyal
men
—
all
good
Protestants
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
know
whether
the
conspirators
have
been
discovered
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
host
of
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
even
know
of
the
plot
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
What
was
its
object?""What
was
its
object
!
"
cried
the
host
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
scarcely
credit
me
when
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
I
tremble
to
speak
of
it
.
<EOS>
Its
object
was
to
blow
up
the
Parliament
House
,
and
the
King
and
all
the
nobles
and
prelates
of
the
land
along
with
it
.
""Horrible
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
guests
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
it
is
a
scheme
of
the
Papists
?
"
asked
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
have
been
told
so
,
"
rejoined
the
host
.
"
<EOS>
But
who
else
could
devise
such
a
monstrous
plan
?
<EOS>
It
would
never
enter
into
the
head
or
heart
of
a
Protestant
to
conceive
so
detestable
an
action
.
<EOS>
We
love
our
King
too
well
for
that
,
and
would
shed
the
last
drop
of
our
blood
rather
than
a
hair
of
his
head
should
be
injured
.
<EOS>
But
these
priest
-
ridden
Papists
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
They
regard
him
as
a
usurper
;
and
having
received
a
dispensation
from
the
Pope
to
that
effect
,
fancy
it
would
be
a
pious
act
to
remove
him
.
<EOS>
There
will
be
no
tranquillity
in
the
kingdom
while
one
of
them
is
left
alive
;
and
I
hope
his
Majesty
will
take
advantage
of
the
present
ferment
to
order
a
general
massacre
of
them
,
like
that
of
the
poor
Protestants
on
Saint
Bartholomew
's
day
in
Paris
.
<EOS>
""Ay,—massacre
them
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
guests
;
"
that
's
the
way
.
<EOS>
Burn
their
houses
and
cut
their
throats
.
<EOS>
Will
it
be
lawful
to
do
so
without
further
authority
<EOS>
,
mine
host
?
<EOS>
If
so
,
we
will
set
about
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
resolve
you
on
that
point
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
You
had
better
wait
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
their
slaughter
will
be
publicly
commanded
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
grant
it
may
be
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
one
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
bear
my
part
in
the
business
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
<EOS>
arose
,
paid
his
reckoning
,
and
strode
out
of
the
tavern
.
<EOS>
"Do
you
know
,
mine
host
,
"
said
the
guest
who
had
last
spoken
,
"
I
half
suspect
that
tall
fellow
,
who
has
just
left
us
,
is
a
Papist
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
<EOS>
a
conspirator
,
"
said
another
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
watch
him
,
"
cried
a
third
.
<EOS>
"Stay
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
host
,
"
he
has
paid
me
double
my
reckoning
.
<EOS>
I
believe
him
to
be
an
honest
man
and
a
good
Protestant
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
you
say
confirms
my
suspicions
,
"
rejoined
the
first
speaker
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
follow
him
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
reaching
Temple
Bar
,
Catesby
found
the
gates
closed
,
and
a
guard
stationed
at
them,—no
one
being
allowed
to
pass
through
without
examination
.
<EOS>
Not
willing
to
expose
himself
to
this
scrutiny
,
Catesby
turned
away
,
and
in
doing
so
,
perceived
three
of
the
persons
he
had
just
left
in
the
tavern
.
<EOS>
The
expression
of
their
countenances
satisfied
him
they
were
dogging
him
;
but
affecting
not
to
perceive
it
,
he
retraced
his
steps
,
gradually
quickening
his
pace
until
he
reached
a
narrow
street
leading
into
Whitefriars
,
down
which
he
darted
.
<EOS>
The
moment
his
pursuers
saw
this
,
they
hurried
after
him
,
shouting
,
"
A
Papist
—
<EOS>
a
Papist!—a
conspirator!"But
Catesby
was
now
safe
.
<EOS>
Claiming
the
protection
of
certain
Alsatians
who
were
lounging
at
the
door
of
a
tavern
,
and
offering
to
reward
them
,
they
instantly
drew
their
swords
,
and
drove
the
others
away
,
while
Catesby
,
tossing
a
few
pieces
of
money
to
his
preservers
,
passed
through
a
small
doorway
into
the
Temple
,
and
making
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
stairs
,
leaped
into
a
boat
,
and
ordered
the
waterman
to
row
to
Westminster
.
<EOS>
The
man
obeyed
,
and
plying
his
oars
,
soon
gained
the
middle
of
the
stream
.
<EOS>
Little
way
,
however
,
had
been
made
,
when
Catesby
descried
a
large
wherry
,
manned
by
several
rowers
,
swiftly
approaching
them
,
and
instinctively
comprehending
whom
it
contained
,
ordered
the
man
to
rest
on
his
oars
till
it
had
passed
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
moments
the
wherry
approached
them
.
<EOS>
It
was
filled
with
serjeants
of
the
guard
and
halberdiers
,
in
the
midst
of
whom
sat
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Catesby
could
not
resist
the
impulse
that
prompted
him
to
rise
,
and
the
movement
attracted
the
attention
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
The
momentary
glance
they
exchanged
convinced
Catesby
that
Fawkes
perceived
him
,
though
his
motionless
features
gave
no
token
of
recognition
,
and
he
immediately
afterwards
fixed
his
eyes
towards
heaven
,
as
if
to
intimate,—at
least
Catesby
so
construed
the
gesture,—that
<EOS>
his
earthly
career
was
well
-
nigh
ended
.
<EOS>
Heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
Catesby
watched
the
wherry
sweep
on
towards
the
Tower,—its
fatal
<EOS>
destination,—until
<EOS>
it
was
lost
to
view
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
is
over
,
I
fear
,
with
the
bravest
of
our
band
,
"
he
thought
,
as
he
tracked
its
course
;
"
but
some
effort
must
be
made
to
save
him
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
we
will
die
sword
in
hand
,
and
like
soldiers
,
and
not
as
common
malefactors
.
<EOS>
"Abandoning
<EOS>
his
intention
of
proceeding
to
Westminster
<EOS>
,
he
desired
the
man
to
pull
ashore
,
and
landing
at
Arundel
Stairs
,
hastened
to
the
Strand
.
<EOS>
Here
he
found
large
crowds
collected
,
the
shops
closed
,
and
business
completely
at
a
stand
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
talked
of
but
the
conspiracy
,
and
the
most
exaggerated
and
extraordinary
accounts
of
it
were
circulated
and
believed
.
<EOS>
Some
would
have
it
that
the
Parliament
House
was
already
blown
up
,
and
that
the
city
of
London
itself
had
been
set
fire
to
in
several
places
by
the
Papists
.
<EOS>
It
was
also
stated
that
numerous
arrests
had
taken
place
,
and
it
was
certain
that
the
houses
of
several
Catholic
nobles
and
wealthy
gentlemen
had
been
searched
.
<EOS>
To
such
a
height
was
the
popular
indignation
raised
,
that
it
required
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
soldiery
to
prevent
the
mob
from
breaking
into
these
houses
,
and
using
violence
towards
their
inmates
.
<EOS>
Every
gate
and
avenue
to
the
palace
was
strictly
guarded
,
and
troops
of
horse
were
continually
scouring
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Sentinels
were
placed
before
suspected
houses
,
and
no
one
was
suffered
to
enter
them
,
or
to
go
forth
without
special
permission
.
<EOS>
Detachments
of
soldiery
were
also
stationed
at
the
end
of
all
the
main
thoroughfares
.
<EOS>
Bars
were
thrown
across
the
smaller
streets
and
outlets
,
and
proclamation
was
made
that
no
one
was
to
quit
the
city
,
however
urgent
his
business
,
for
three
days
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
announcement
,
Catesby
saw
at
once
that
if
he
did
not
effect
his
escape
immediately
,
it
would
be
impracticable
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
hurried
towards
Charing
-
cross
,
and
turning
up
St.
Martin's
-
lane
,
at
the
back
of
the
King
's
Mews
,
contrived
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
the
guard
,
and
speeded
along
the
lane,—for
<EOS>
it
was
then
literally
so
,
and
surrounded
on
either
side
by
<EOS>
high
hedges,—until
<EOS>
he
came
to
St.
Giles's,—at
this
time
<EOS>
nothing
more
than
a
few
scattered
houses
,
intermixed
with
trees
.
<EOS>
Here
he
encountered
a
man
mounted
on
a
powerful
steed
,
and
seeing
this
person
look
hard
at
him
,
would
have
drawn
out
of
the
way
,
if
the
other
had
not
addressed
him
by
name
.
<EOS>
He
then
regarded
the
equestrian
more
narrowly
,
and
found
it
was
Martin
Heydocke
.
<EOS>
"I
have
heard
what
has
happened
,
Mr.
Catesby
,
"
said
Martin
,
"
and
can
imagine
the
desperate
strait
in
which
you
must
be
placed
.
<EOS>
Take
my
horse,—it
may
aid
your
flight
.
<EOS>
I
was
sent
to
London
by
my
master
,
Mr.
Humphrey
Chetham
,
to
bring
him
intelligence
of
the
result
of
your
attempt
,
and
I
am
sure
I
am
acting
in
accordance
with
his
wishes
in
rendering
you
such
a
service
.
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
I
will
risk
it
.
<EOS>
Mount
,
sir,—mount
,
and
make
the
best
of
your
way
hence
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
<EOS>
needed
no
further
exhortation
,
but
,
springing
into
the
saddle
,
hastily
murmured
his
thanks
,
and
striking
into
a
lane
on
the
right
,
rode
off
at
a
swift
pace
towards
Highgate
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
brow
of
this
beautiful
hill
,
he
drew
in
the
bridle
for
a
moment
,
and
gazed
towards
the
city
he
had
just
quitted
.
<EOS>
Dark
and
bitter
were
his
thoughts
as
he
fixed
his
eye
upon
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
fancied
he
could
discern
the
neighbouring
pile
,
whose
destruction
he
had
meditated
.
<EOS>
Remembering
that
from
this
very
spot
,
when
he
had
last
approached
the
capital
,
in
company
with
Guy
Fawkes
and
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
he
had
looked
in
the
same
direction
,
he
could
not
help
contrasting
his
present
sensations
with
those
he
had
then
experienced
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
he
was
full
of
ardour
,
and
confident
of
success
.
<EOS>
Now
,
all
was
lost
to
him
,
and
he
was
anxious
for
little
more
than
self
-
preservation
.
<EOS>
Involuntarily
,
his
eye
wandered
along
the
great
city
,
until
passing
over
the
mighty
fabric
of
Saint
Paul
's
,
it
settled
upon
the
Tower,—upon
the
place
of
Guy
Fawkes
's
captivity
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
can
nothing
be
done
for
his
deliverance
?
"
<EOS>
sighed
Catesby
,
as
he
turned
away
,
his
eyes
filling
with
moisture
"
must
that
brave
soldier
die
the
death
of
a
felon
—
must
he
be
subjected
to
the
torture
—
horror
!
<EOS>
If
he
had
died
defending
himself
,
I
should
scarcely
have
pitied
him
.
<EOS>
And
if
he
had
destroyed
himself
,
together
with
his
foes
,
as
he
resolved
to
do
,
I
should
have
envied
him
.
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
what
he
will
have
to
suffer
in
that
dreadful
place
—
nay
,
what
he
is
now
,
perhaps
,
suffering
—
makes
the
life
-
blood
curdle
in
my
veins
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
fall
alive
into
their
hands
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
resolve
,
he
struck
spurs
into
his
steed
,
and
,
urging
him
to
a
swift
pace
,
dashed
rapidly
forward
.
<EOS>
He
had
ridden
more
than
a
mile
,
when
hearing
shouts
behind
him
,
he
perceived
two
troopers
galloping
after
him
as
fast
as
their
horses
could
carry
them
.
<EOS>
They
shouted
to
him
to
stay
,
and
as
they
were
better
mounted
than
he
was
,
it
was
evident
they
would
soon
come
up
with
him
.
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
to
adhere
to
the
resolution
he
had
just
formed
,
and
not
to
yield
himself
with
life
,
he
prepared
for
a
conflict
,
and
suddenly
halting
,
he
concealed
a
petronel
beneath
his
cloak
,
and
waited
till
his
foes
drew
near
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
command
you
,
in
the
King
's
name
,
to
surrender
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
foremost
trooper
,
riding
up
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
a
rebel
and
a
traitor
.
<EOS>
""Be
this
<EOS>
my
answer
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
aiming
at
the
man
,
and
firing
with
such
certainty
,
that
he
fell
from
his
horse
mortally
wounded
.
<EOS>
Unsheathing
his
sword
,
he
then
prepared
to
attack
the
other
trooper
.
<EOS>
But
,
terrified
at
the
fate
of
his
comrade
,
the
man
turned
his
horse
's
head
,
and
rode
off
.
<EOS>
Without
bestowing
a
thought
on
the
dying
man
who
lay
groaning
in
the
mire
,
Catesby
caught
hold
of
the
bridle
of
his
horse
,
and
satisfied
that
the
animal
was
better
than
his
own
,
mounted
him
,
and
proceeded
at
the
same
headlong
pace
as
before
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
he
reached
Finchley
,
where
several
persons
rushed
from
their
dwellings
to
inquire
whether
he
brought
any
intelligence
of
the
plot
,
rumours
of
which
had
already
reached
them
.
<EOS>
Without
stopping
,
Catesby
replied
that
most
important
discoveries
had
been
made
,
and
that
he
was
carrying
despatches
from
the
King
to
Northampton
.
<EOS>
No
opposition
was
therefore
offered
him
,
and
he
soon
left
all
traces
of
habitation
behind
him
.
<EOS>
Urging
his
horse
to
its
utmost
,
he
arrived
,
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
Chipping
Barnet
.
<EOS>
Here
the
same
inquiries
were
made
as
at
Finchley
,
and
returning
the
same
answer
—
for
he
never
relaxed
his
speed
for
a
moment
—
he
pursued
his
course
.
<EOS>
In
less
than
three
quarters
of
an
hour
after
this
,
he
arrived
at
Saint
Albans
,
and
proceeding
direct
to
the
post
-
house
,
asked
for
a
horse
.
<EOS>
But
instead
of
complying
with
the
request
,
the
landlord
of
the
Rose
and
Crown
—
such
was
the
name
of
the
hostel
—
instantly
withdrew
,
and
returned
the
next
moment
with
an
officer
,
who
desired
to
speak
with
Catesby
before
he
proceeded
further
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
took
no
notice
of
the
demand
,
but
rode
off
.
<EOS>
The
clatter
of
horses
'
hoofs
behind
him
soon
convinced
him
he
was
again
pursued
,
and
he
was
just
beginning
to
consider
in
what
way
he
should
make
a
second
defence
,
when
he
observed
two
horsemen
cross
a
lane
on
the
left
,
and
make
for
the
main
road
.
<EOS>
His
situation
now
appeared
highly
perilous
,
especially
as
his
pursuers
,
who
had
noticed
the
other
horsemen
at
the
same
time
as
himself
,
shouted
to
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
speedily
relieved
.
<EOS>
These
persons
,
instead
of
stopping
,
accelerated
their
pace
,
and
appeared
as
anxious
as
he
was
to
avoid
those
behind
him
.
<EOS>
They
were
now
within
a
short
distance
of
Dunstable
,
and
were
ascending
the
lovely
downs
which
lie
on
the
London
side
of
this
ancient
town
,
when
one
of
the
horsemen
in
front
chancing
to
turn
round
,
Catesby
perceived
it
was
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
the
discovery
,
he
shouted
to
him
at
the
top
of
his
voice
,
and
the
other
,
who
it
presently
appeared
was
accompanied
by
Keyes
,
instantly
stopped
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
Catesby
was
by
their
side
,
and
a
rapid
explanation
taking
place
,
they
all
three
drew
up
in
order
of
battle
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
their
pursuers
had
arrived
within
a
hundred
yards
of
them
,
and
seeing
how
matters
stood
,
and
not
willing
to
hazard
an
engagement
,
after
a
brief
consultation
,
retired
.
<EOS>
The
three
friends
then
pursued
their
route
,
passed
through
Dunstable
,
and
without
pausing
a
moment
on
the
road
,
soon
neared
Fenny
Stratford
.
<EOS>
Just
before
they
arrived
at
this
place
,
Catesby
's
horse
fell
from
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
Instantly
extricating
himself
from
the
fallen
animal
,
he
ran
by
the
side
of
his
companions
till
they
got
to
the
town
,
where
Rookwood
,
who
had
placed
relays
on
the
road
,
changed
his
horse
,
and
the
others
were
fortunate
enough
to
procure
fresh
steeds
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
with
unabated
impetuosity
,
they
soon
cleared
a
few
more
miles
,
and
had
just
left
Stony
Stratford
behind
them
,
when
they
overtook
a
solitary
horseman
,
who
proved
to
be
John
Wright
,
and
a
little
further
on
they
came
up
with
Percy
,
and
Christopher
Wright
.
<EOS>
Though
their
numbers
were
thus
increased
,
they
did
not
consider
themselves
secure
,
but
flinging
their
cloaks
away
to
enable
them
to
proceed
with
greater
expedition
,
hurried
on
to
Towcester

<EOS>
Here
Keyes
quitted
his
companions
,
and
shaped
his
course
into
Warwickshire
,
where
he
was
afterwards
taken
,
while
the
others
,
having
procured
fresh
horses
,
made
the
best
of
their
way
to
Ashby
Saint
Leger's
.
<EOS>
About
six
o'clock
,
Catesby
and
his
companions
arrived
at
his
old
family
seat
,
which
he
had
expected
to
approach
in
triumph
,
but
which
he
now
approached
with
feelings
of
the
deepest
mortification
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
They
found
the
house
filled
with
guests
—
among
whom
was
Robert
Winter
—
who
were
just
sitting
down
to
supper
.
<EOS>
Catesby
rushed
into
the
room
in
which
these
persons
were
assembled
,
covered
with
mud
and
dirt
,
his
haggard
looks
and
dejected
appearance
proclaiming
that
his
project
had
failed
.
<EOS>
His
friends
followed
,
and
their
appearance
confirmed
the
impression
that
he
had
produced
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catesby
hastened
to
her
son
,
and
strove
to
comfort
him
;
but
he
rudely
repulsed
her
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
matter
?
<EOS>
"
she
anxiously
inquired
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
matter
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
in
a
furious
tone
,
and
stamping
his
foot
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"
All
is
lost
!
<EOS>
our
scheme
is
discovered
;
Guy
Fawkes
is
a
prisoner
,
and
ere
long
we
shall
all
be
led
to
the
block
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
all
!
"
<EOS>
he
repeated
,
gazing
sternly
around
.
<EOS>
"I
will
never
be
led
thither
with
life
,
"
said
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
added
a
young
Catholic
gentleman
,
named
Acton
of
Ribbesford
,
who
had
lately
joined
the
conspiracy
.
<EOS>
"
Though
the
great
design
has
failed
,
we
are
yet
free
,
and
have
swords
to
draw
,
and
arms
to
wield
them
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
"
exclaimed
Robert
Winter
,
"
all
our
friends
are
assembled
at
Dunchurch
.
<EOS>
Let
us
join
them
instantly
,
and
we
may
yet
stir
up
a
rebellion
which
may
accomplish
all
we
can
desire
.
<EOS>
I
,
myself
,
accompanied
Humphrey
Littleton
to
Dunchurch
this
morning
,
and
know
we
shall
find
everything
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
despair
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Lady
Catesby
;
"
all
will
yet
be
well
.
<EOS>
Every
member
of
our
faith
will
join
you
,
and
you
will
soon
muster
a
formidable
army
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
must
not
yield
without
a
blow
,
"
cried
Percy
,
pouring
out
a
bumper
of
wine
,
and
swallowing
it
at
a
draught
.
<EOS>
"You
are
right
,
"
said
Rookwood
,
imitating
his
example
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
sell
our
lives
dearly
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
will
adhere
to
this
resolution
,
gentlemen
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
we
may
yet
retrieve
our
loss
.
<EOS>
With
five
hundred
stanch
followers
,
who
will
stand
by
me
to
the
last
,
I
will
engage
to
raise
such
a
rebellion
in
England
as
shall
not
be
checked
,
except
by
the
acknowledgment
of
our
rights
,
or
the
dethronement
of
the
king
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
will
all
stand
by
you
,
"
cried
the
others
.
<EOS>
"Swear
<EOS>
it
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
raising
the
glass
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
do
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"Wearied
<EOS>
as
we
are
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
"
<EOS>
we
must
at
once
proceed
to
Dunchurch
,
and
urge
our
friends
to
rise
in
arms
with
us
.
<EOS>
""Agreed
,
"
cried
the
others
.
<EOS>
Summoning
all
his
household
,
and
arming
them
,
Catesby
then
set
out
with
the
rest
for
Dunchurch
,
which
lay
about
five
miles
from
Ashby
Saint
Leger
's
.
<EOS>
They
arrived
there
in
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
,
and
found
the
mansion
crowded
with
Catholic
gentlemen
and
their
servants
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
banquet
hall
,
they
found
Sir
Everard
Digby
at
the
head
of
the
board
,
with
Garnet
on
his
right
hand
.
<EOS>
Upwards
of
sixty
persons
were
seated
at
the
table
.
<EOS>
Their
arrival
was
greeted
with
loud
shouts
,
and
several
of
the
guests
drew
their
swords
and
flourished
them
over
their
heads
.
<EOS>
"What
news
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
"
Is
the
blow
struck?""No
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
we
have
been
betrayed
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
deep
silence
prevailed
.
<EOS>
A
change
came
over
the
countenances
of
the
guests
.
<EOS>
Significant
glances
were
exchanged
,
and
it
was
evident
that
general
uneasiness
prevailed
.
<EOS>
"What
is
to
be
done
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
course
is
clear
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
stand
by
each
other
.
<EOS>
In
that
case
,
we
have
nothing
to
fear
,
and
shall
accomplish
our
purpose
,
though
not
in
the
way
originally
intended
.
<EOS>
""I
will
have
nothing
further
to
do
with
the
matter
,
"
said
Sir
Robert
Digby
of
Coleshill
,
Sir
Everard
's
uncle
.
<EOS>
And
rising
,
he
quitted
the
room
with
several
of
his
followers
,
while
his
example
was
imitated
by
Humphrey
Littleton
and
others
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
chance
for
the
restoration
of
our
faith
in
England
is
over
,
"
observed
Garnet
,
in
a
tone
of
despondency
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
,
father
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
"
if
we
are
true
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
My
friends
,
"
he
cried
,
stopping
those
who
were
about
to
depart
,
"
in
the
name
of
our
holy
religion
I
beseech
you
to
pause
.
<EOS>
Much
is
against
us
now
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
hold
together
,
and
all
will
speedily
be
righted
.
<EOS>
Every
Catholic
in
this
county
,
in
Cheshire
,
in
Lancashire
,
and
Wales
,
must
flock
to
our
standard
when
it
is
once
displayed
—
do
not
desert
us
—
do
not
desert
yourselves
—
for
our
cause
is
your
cause
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
large
force
at
my
command
;
so
has
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
and
together
we
can
muster
nearly
five
hundred
adherents
.
<EOS>
With
these
,
we
can
offer
such
a
stand
as
will
enable
as
to
make
conditions
with
our
opponents
,
or
even
to
engage
with
them
with
a
reasonable
prospect
of
success
.
<EOS>
I
am
well
assured
,
moreover
,
if
we
lose
no
time
,
but
proceed
to
the
houses
of
our
friends
,
we
shall
have
a
large
army
with
us
.
<EOS>
Do
not
fall
off
,
then
.
<EOS>
On
you
depends
our
success
.
<EOS>
"This
address
was
followed
by
loud
acclamations
;
and
all
who
heard
it
agreed
to
stand
by
the
cause
in
which
they
had
embarked
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
As
Catesby
left
the
banqueting
-
hall
with
Sir
Everard
,
to
make
preparations
for
their
departure
,
they
met
Viviana
and
a
female
attendant
.
<EOS>
"I
hear
the
enterprise
has
failed
,
"
she
cried
,
in
a
voice
suffocated
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
"
What
has
happened
to
my
husband
?
<EOS>
Is
he
safe
?
<EOS>
Is
he
with
you?""Alas
!
<EOS>
no

"
replied
Catesby
;
"
he
is
a
prisoner

<EOS>
"Viviana
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
,

fell
senseless
into
the
arms

the
attendant

THE
EXAMINATIONDisarmed
by
Sir
Thomas
Knevet
and
his
followers
,
who
found
upon
his
person
a
packet
of
slow
matches
and
touchwood
,
and
bound
hand
and
foot
,
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
dragged
into
the
cellar
by
his
captors
,
who
instantly
commenced
their
search
.
<EOS>
In
a
corner
behind
the
door
they
discovered
a
dark
lantern
,
with
a
light
burning
within
it
;
and
moving
with
the
utmost
caution
—
for
they
were
afraid
of
bringing
sudden
destruction
upon
themselves
—
they
soon
perceived
the
barrels
of
gunpowder
ranged
against
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Carefully
removing
the
planks
,
billets
,
and
iron
bars
with
which
they
were
covered
,
they
remarked
that
two
of
the
casks
were
staved
in
,
while
the
hoops
from
a
third
were
taken
off
,
and
the
powder
scattered
around
it
.
<EOS>
They
also
noticed
that
several
trains
were
laid
along
the
floor,—everything
,
in
short
,
betokening
that
the
preparations
for
the
desperate
deed
were
fully
completed
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
making
this
investigation
,
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
,
seeing
that
further
resistance
was
useless
,
had
remained
perfectly
motionless
up
to
this
moment
,
suddenly
made
a
struggle
to
free
himself
;
and
so
desperate
was
the
effort
,
that
he
burst
the
leathern
thong
that
bound
his
hands
,
and
seizing
the
soldier
nearest
to
him
,
bore
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
He
then
grasped
the
lower
limbs
of
another
,
who
held
a
lantern
,
and
strove
to
overthrow
him
,
and
wrest
the
lantern
from
his
grasp
,
evidently
intending
to
apply
the
light
to
the
powder
.
<EOS>
And
he
would
unquestionably
have
executed
his
terrible
design
,
if
three
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
soldiers
had
not
thrown
themselves
upon
him
,
and
overpowered
him
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
moment
;
but
it
was
so
startling
,
that
Sir
Thomas
Knevet
and
Topcliffe
,
though
both
courageous
men
,
and
used
to
scenes
of
danger
—
especially
the
latter
—
rushed
towards
the
door
,
expecting
some
dreadful
catastrophe
would
take
place
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
him
<EOS>
no
harm
,
"
cried
Knevet
,
as
he
returned
to
the
soldiers
,
who
were
still
struggling
with
Fawkes,—"do
him
no
harm
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
here
he
must
die
.
<EOS>
""A
moment
more
,
and
I
had
blown
you
all
to
perdition
,
"
cried
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Heaven
ordained
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
will
never
assist
such
damnable
designs
as
yours
,
"
rejoined
Knevet
.
"
<EOS>
Thrust
him
into
that
corner
,
"
he
added
to
his
men
,
who
instantly
obeyed
his
injunctions
,
and
held
down
the
prisoner
so
firmly
that
he
could
not
move
a
limb
.
"
<EOS>
Keep
him
there
.
<EOS>
I
will
question
him
presently
.
<EOS>
""You
may
question
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
sternly
;
"
but
you
will
obtain
no
answer
.
<EOS>
""We
shall
see
,
"
returned
Knevet
.
<EOS>
Pursuing
the
search
with
Topcliffe
,
he
counted
thirty
-
six
hogsheads
and
casks
of
various
sizes
,
all
of
which
were
afterwards
found
to
be
filled
with
powder
.
<EOS>
Though
prepared
for
this
discovery
,
Knevet
could
not
repress
his
horror
at
it
,
and
gave
vent
to
execrations
against
the
prisoner
,
to
which
the
other
replied
by
a
disdainful
laugh
.
<EOS>
They
then
looked
about
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
some
document
or
fragment
of
a
letter
,
which
might
serve
as
a
clue
to
the
other
parties
connected
with
the
fell
design
,
but
without
success
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
found
except
a
pile
of
arms
;
but
though
they
examined
them
,
no
name
or
cipher
could
be
traced
on
any
of
the
weapons
.
<EOS>
"We
<EOS>
will
now
examine
the
prisoner
more
narrowly
,
"
said
Knevet
.
<EOS>
This
was
accordingly
done
.
<EOS>
On
removing
Guy
Fawkes
's
doublet
,
a
horse
-
hair
shirt
appeared
,
and
underneath
it
,
next
his
heart
,
suspended
by
a
silken
cord
from
his
neck
,
was
a
small
silver
cross
.
<EOS>
When
this
was
taken
from
him
,
Guy
Fawkes
could
not
repress
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
"There
<EOS>
is
some
secret
attached
to
that
cross
,
"
whispered
Topcliffe
,
plucking
Knevet
's
sleeve
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
other
held
it
to
the
light
,
while
Topcliffe
kept
his
eye
fixed
upon
the
prisoner
,
and
observed
that
,
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
to
preserve
an
unmoved
demeanour
,
he
was
slightly
agitated
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
perceive
anything
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
"
replied
Knevet
,
"
there
is
a
name
.
<EOS>
But
the
character
is
so
small
I
can
not
decipher
it
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
me
look
at
it
,
"
said
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
most
important
,
"
he
added
,
after
gazing
at
it
for
a
moment
;
"
the
words
inscribed
on
it
are
,
'
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
Ordsall
Hall
'
<EOS>
You
may
remember
that
this
young
lady
was
examined
a
short
time
ago
,
on
suspicion
of
being
connected
with
some
Popish
plot
against
the
state
,
and
committed
to
the
Tower
,
whence
she
escaped
in
a
very
extraordinary
manner
.
<EOS>
This
cross
,
found
upon
the
prisoner
,
proves
her
connexion
with
the
present
plot
.
<EOS>
Every
effort
must
be
used
to
discover
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
"Another
<EOS>
deep
sigh
involuntarily
broke
from
the
breast
of
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"You
hear
how
deeply
interested
he
is
in
the
matter
,
"
observed
Topcliffe
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
This
trinket
will
be
of
infinite
service
to
us
in
future
examinations
,
and
may
do
more
for
us
with
this
stubborn
subject
even
than
the
rack
itself
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
returned
Knevet
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
now
convey
him
to
Whitehall
,
and
acquaint
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
with
his
capture
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
further
duty
to
perform
.
<EOS>
Before
morning
I
hope
to
net
the
whole
of
this
wolfish
pack
.
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Knevet
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
any
knowledge
of
the
others?"Topcliffe
smiled
significantly
.
<EOS>
"Time
will
show
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
you
do
not
require
me
further
,
I
will
leave
you
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
quitted
the
cellar
,
and
joined
the
Earl
of
Mounteagle
and
Tresham
,
who
were
waiting
for
him
outside
at
a
little
distance
from
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
conference
,
it
was
arranged
,
in
compliance
with
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
wishes
,
that
if
they
failed
in
entrapping
the
conspirators
,
nothing
should
be
said
about
the
matter
.
<EOS>
He
then
departed
with
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Their
subsequent
proceedings
have
already
been
related
.
<EOS>
By
Sir
Thomas
Knevet
's
directions
,
Guy
Fawkes
was
now
raised
by
two
of
the
soldiers
,
and
led
out
of
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
through
the
door
,
he
uttered
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
groan
for
what
you
have
done
,
villain
,
"
said
one
of
the
soldiers
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
the
contrary
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
sternly
,
"
I
groan
for
what
I
have
not
done

<EOS>
"He
was
then
hurried
along
by
his
conductors
,
and
conveyed
through
the
great
western
gate
,
into
the
palace
of
Whitehall
,
where
he
was
placed
in
a
small
room
,
the
windows
of
which
were
strongly
grated
.
<EOS>
Before
quitting
him
,
Sir
Thomas
Knevet
put
several
questions
to
him
,
but
he
maintained
a
stern
and
obstinate
silence
.
<EOS>
Committing
him
to
the
custody
of
an
officer
of
the
guard
,
whom
he
enjoined
to
keep
strict
guard
over
him
,
as
he
valued
his
life
,
Knevet
then
went
in
search
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
The
Secretary
,
who
had
not
retired
to
rest
,
and
was
anxiously
awaiting
his
arrival
,
was
delighted
with
the
success
of
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
They
were
presently
joined
by
Lord
Mounteagle
;
and
after
a
brief
conference
it
was
resolved
to
summon
the
Privy
Council
immediately
,
to
rouse
the
King
,
and
acquaint
him
with
what
had
occurred
,
and
to
interrogate
the
prisoner
in
his
presence
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
will
be
obtained
from
him
,
I
fear
,
"
said
Knevet
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
one
of
the
most
resolute
and
determined
fellows
I
ever
encountered
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
then
related
the
desperate
attempt
made
by
Fawkes
in
the
vault
to
blow
them
all
up
.
<EOS>
"Whether
<EOS>
he
will
speak
or
not
,
the
King
must
see
him
,
"
said
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Knevet
was
gone
,
the
Earl
observed
to
Mounteagle
,
"
You
had
now
better
leave
the
palace
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
appear
further
in
this
matter
,
except
as
we
have
arranged
.
<EOS>
Before
morning
,
I
trust
we
shall
have
the
whole
of
the
conspirators
in
our
power
,
with
damning
proofs
of
their
guilt
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
this
time
,
my
lord
,
they
are
in
Tresham
's
hands
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
he
fails
,
not
a
word
must
be
said
,
"
observed
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
not
be
supposed
we
have
moved
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
All
great
statesmen
have
contrived
treasons
,
that
they
might
afterwards
discover
them
;
and
though
I
have
not
contrived
this
plot
,
I
have
known
of
its
existence
from
the
first
,
and
could
at
any
time
have
crushed
it
had
<EOS>
I
been
so
minded
.
<EOS>
But
that
would
not
have
answered
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
now
use
it
as
a
pretext
to
crush
the
whole
Catholic
party
,
except
those
on
whom
,
like
yourself
,
I
can
confidently
rely
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
lordship
must
admit
that
I
have
well
seconded
your
efforts
,
"
observed
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
so
,
"
replied
Salisbury
,
"
and
you
will
not
find
me
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
Farewell
!
<EOS>
I
hope
soon
to
hear
of
our
further
success
.
"Mounteagle
<EOS>
then
took
his
departure
,
and
Salisbury
immediately
caused
all
such
members
of
the
Privy
Council
as
lodged
in
the
palace
to
be
aroused
,
desiring
they
might
be
informed
that
a
terrible
plot
had
been
discovered
,
and
a
conspirator
arrested
.
<EOS>
In
a
short
time
,
the
Duke
of
Lennox
,
the
Earl
of
Marr
,
Lord
Hume
,
the
Earl
of
Southampton
,
Lord
Henry
Howard
,
Lord
Mountjoy
,
Sir
George
Hume
,
and
others
,
were
assembled
;
and
all
eagerly
inquired
into
the
occasion
of
the
sudden
alarm
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
had
himself
repaired
to
the
King
's
bedchamber
,
and
acquainted
him
with
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
James
immediately
roused
himself
,
and
desired
the
chamberlain
,
who
accompanied
the
Earl
,
to
quit
the
presence
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
it
be
safe
to
interrogate
the
prisoner
here
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"I
will
take
care
<EOS>
your
Majesty
shall
receive
no
injury
,
"
replied
Salisbury
;
"
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
you
should
examine
him
before
he
is
committed
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
be
brought
before
me
,
then
,
directly
,
"
said
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
impatient
to
behold
a
wretch
who
has
conceived
so
atrocious
—
so
infernal
a
design
against
me
,
and
against
my
children
.
<EOS>
Hark
'
e
,
Salisbury
,
one
caution
I
wish
to
observe
.
<EOS>
Let
a
captain
of
the
guard
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
hand
,
place
himself
between
me
and
the
prisoner
,
and
let
two
halberdiers
stand
beside
him
,
and
if
the
villain
moves
a
step
,
bid
them
strike
him
dead
.
<EOS>
You
understand?"Illustration"Perfectly
,
"
replied
Salisbury
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
that
case
,
you
may
take
off
his
bonds
—
that
is
,
if
you
think
it
prudent
to
do
so
—
not
otherwise
,
"
continued
James
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
have
the
knave
suppose
he
can
awe
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
Majesty
's
commands
shall
be
fulfilled
to
the
letter
,
"
returned
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"Lose
<EOS>
no
time
,
Salisbury
,
"
cried
James
,
springing
out
of
bed
,
and
beginning
to
dress
himself
without
the
assistance
of
his
chamberlain
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
hastily
retired
,
and
ordered
the
attendants
to
repair
to
their
royal
master
.
<EOS>
He
next
proceeded
to
the
chamber
where
Guy
Fawkes
was
detained
,
and
ordered
him
to
be
unbound
,
and
brought
before
the
King
.
<EOS>
When
the
prisoner
heard
this
mandate
,
a
slight
smile
crossed
his
countenance
,
but
he
instantly
resumed
his
former
stern
composure
.
<EOS>
The
smile
,
however
,
did
not
escape
the
notice
of
Salisbury
,
and
he
commanded
the
halberdiers
to
keep
near
to
the
prisoner
,
and
if
he
made
the
slightest
movement
in
the
King
's
presence
,
instantly
to
despatch
him
.
<EOS>
Giving
some
further
directions
,
the
Earl
then
led
the
way
across
a
court
,
and
entering
another
wing
of
the
palace
,
ascended
a
flight
of
steps
,
and
traversed
a
magnificent
corridor
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
followed
,
attended
by
the
guard
.
<EOS>
They
had
now
reached
the
antechamber
leading
to
the
royal
sleeping
apartment
,
and
"
Salisbury
ascertained
from
the
officers
in
attendance
that
all
was
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Motioning
the
guard
to
remain
where
they
were
,
he
entered
the
inner
room
alone
,
and
found
James
seated
on
a
chair
of
state
near
the
bed
,
surrounded
by
his
council;—the
Earl
of
Marr
standing
on
his
right
hand
,
and
the
Duke
of
Lennox
on
his
left
,
all
anxiously
awaiting
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
Behind
the
King
were
stationed
half
a
dozen
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prisoner
is
without
,
"
said
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
your
Majesty
's
pleasure
that
he
be
admitted?""Ay
,
let
him
come
in
forthwith
,
"
replied
James
.
<EOS>
"
Stand
by
me
,
my
lords
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
,
varlets
,
keep
a
wary
eye
upon
him
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
saying
what
he
may
attempt
.
<EOS>
"Salisbury
<EOS>
then
waved
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
an
officer
entered
the
room
,
followed
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
marched
between
two
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
When
within
a
couple
of
yards
of
the
King
,
the
officer
halted
,
and
withdrew
a
little
on
the
right
,
so
as
to
allow
full
view
of
the
prisoner
,
while
he
extended
his
sword
between
him
and
the
King
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
undaunted
than
the
looks
and
demeanour
of
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
He
strode
firmly
into
the
room
,
and
without
making
any
reverence
,
folded
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
and
looked
sternly
at
James
.
<EOS>
"A
bold
villain
!
"
cried
the
King
,
as
he
regarded
him
with
curiosity
not
unmixed
with
alarm
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who
,
and
what
are
you
,
traitor?""A
conspirator
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"That
I
know
,
"
rejoined
James
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
are
you
called?""John
Johnson
,
"
answered
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
servant
to
Mr.
Thomas
Percy
.
<EOS>
""That
is
false
,
"
cried
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
Take
heed
that
you
speak
the
truth
,
traitor
,
or
the
rack
shall
force
it
from
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
rack
will
force
nothing
from
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
sternly
;
"
neither
will
I
answer
any
question
asked
by
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
""Leave
him
to
me
<EOS>
,
Salisbury,—leave
him
to
me
,
"
interposed
James
.
<EOS>
"
And
it
was
your
hellish
design
to
blow
us
all
up
with
gunpowder
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"It
was
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
how
could
you
resolve
to
destroy
so
many
persons
,
none
of
whom
have
injured
you
?
"
pursued
James
.
<EOS>
"Dangerous
<EOS>
diseases
require
desperate
remedies
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Milder
means
have
been
tried
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
It
was
God
's
pleasure
that
this
scheme
,
which
was
for
the
benefit
of
his
holy
religion
,
should
not
prosper
,
and
therefore
I
do
not
repine
at
the
result
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
are
you
so
blinded
as
to
suppose
that
Heaven
can
approve
the
actions
of
him
who
raises
his
hand
against
the
King
—
against
the
Lord
's
anointed
?
"
cried
James
.
<EOS>
"He
is
no
king
who
is
excommunicated
by
the
apostolic
see
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"This
to
our
face
!
<EOS>
"
cried
James
,
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
Have
you
no
remorse
—
no
compunction
for
what
you
have
done?""My
<EOS>
sole
regret
is
that
I
have
failed
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
speak
thus
confidently
on
the
rack
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"Try
<EOS>
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"What
purpose
<EOS>
did
you
hope
to
accomplish
by
this
atrocious
design
?
"
<EOS>
'
demanded
the
Earl
of
Marr
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
main
purpose
was
to
blow
back
the
beggarly
Scots
to
their
native
mountains
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"This
audacity
surpasses
belief
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"

Mutius

when
in

resolute

<EOS>
,
if
I
give
you
your

will
you
disclose
the

"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"They
shall
be
wrung
from
you
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
smiled
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
You
know
me
not
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"It
is
idle
to
interrogate
him
further
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
Let
him
be
removed
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
returned
Salisbury
;
"
and
when
next
your
Majesty
questions
him
,
I
trust
it
will
be
in
the
presence
of
his
confederates

<EOS>
""Despite
<EOS>
the
villain
's
horrible
intent
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
help
admiring
his
courage

observed
James
,
in
a
low
tone
;
"
and
were
he
as
loyal
as
he
is
brave
<EOS>
,
he
should
always
be
near
our
person

<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
waved
his
hand
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
was
led
forth
.
<EOS>
He
was
detained
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury

orders
till
the
morning,—it
being
anticipated
that
before
that
time
the
other
conspirators
would
be
arrested

<EOS>
But
as
this
was
not
the
case

he
was
placed
in

conveyed

BOOK
THE
THIRD
<EOS>
—
THE
CONSPIRATORS.The
conclusion
shall
be
from
the
admirable
clemency
and
moderation
of
the
king
;
in
that
,
howsoever
these
traitors
have
exceeded
all
others
in
mischief
,
yet
neither
will
the
king
exceed
the
usual
punishment
of
law
,
nor
invent
any
new
torture
or
torment
for
them
,
but
is
graciously
pleased
to
afford
them
as
well
an
ordinary
course
of
trial
as
an
ordinary
punishment
much
inferior
to
their
offence
.
<EOS>
And
surely
worthy
of
observation
is
the
punishment
by
law
provided
and
appointed
for
high
treason
:
<EOS>
for
,
first
,
after
a
traitor
hath
had
his
just
trial
,
and
is
convicted
and
attainted
,
he
shall
have
his
judgment
to
be
drawn
to
the
place
of
execution
from
his
prison
,
as
being
not
worthy
any
more
to
tread
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
<EOS>
whereof
he
was
made
;
also
,
for
that
he
hath
been
retrograde
to
nature
,
therefore
is
he
drawn
backward
at
a
horsetail
.
<EOS>
After
,
to
have
his
head
cut
off
which
had
imagined
the
mischief
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
his
body
to
be
quartered
,
and
<EOS>
the
quarters
set
up
in
some
high
and
eminent
place
,
to
the
view
and
detestation
of
men
,
and
to
become
a
prey
for
the
fowls
of
the
air
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
a
reward
due
to
traitors
,
whose
hearts
be
hardened
;
for
that
it
is
a
physic
of
state
and
government
to
let
out
corrupt
blood
from
the
heart.—Sir

HOW
GUY
FAWKES
WAS
PUT
TO
THE
TORTUREIntimation
of
the
arrest
of
Guy
Fawkes
having
been
sent
to
the
Tower
,
his
arrival
was
anxiously
expected
by
the
warders
and
soldiers
composing
the
garrison
,
a
crowd
of
whom
posted
themselves
at
the
entrance
of
Traitor
's
Gate
,
to
obtain
a
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
As
the
bark
that
conveyed
the
prisoner
shot
through
London
Bridge
,
and
neared
the
fortress
,
notice
of
its
approach
was
given
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
,
scarcely
less
impatient
,
had
stationed
himself
in
a
small
circular
chamber
in
one
of
the
turrets
of
Saint
Thomas
's
or
Traitor
's
Tower
,
overlooking
the
river
.
<EOS>
He
hastily
descended
,
and
had
scarcely
reached
the
place
of
disembarkation
,
when
the
boat
passed
beneath
the
gloomy
archway
,
the
immense
wooden
wicket
closed
behind
it
;
and
the
officer
in
command
springing
ashore
,
was
followed
more
deliberately
by
Fawkes
,
who
mounted
the
slippery
stairs
with
a
firm
footstep
.
<EOS>
As
he
gained
the
summit
,
the
spectators
pressed
forward
;
but
Sir
William
Waad
,
ordering
them
in
an
authoritative
tone
to
stand
back
,
fixed
a
stern
and
scrutinizing
glance
on
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"Many
<EOS>
vile
traitors
have
ascended
those
steps
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
none
so
false
-
hearted
,
none
so
bloodthirsty
as
you
.
<EOS>
""None
<EOS>
ever
ascended
them
with
less
misgiving
,
or
with
less
self
-
reproach
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Miserable
wretch
!
<EOS>
Do
you
glory
in
your
villany
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
If
anything
could
heighten
my
detestation
of
the
pernicious
creed
you
profess
,
it
would
be
to
witness
its
effects
on
such
minds
as
yours
.
<EOS>
What
a
religion
must
that
be
,
which
can
induce
its
followers
to
commit
such
monstrous
actions
,
and
delude
them
into
the
belief
that
they
are
pious
and
praiseworthy!""It
is
a
religion
,
<EOS>
at
least
,
that
supports
them
at
seasons
when
they
most
require
it
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Peace
!
"
cried
the
lieutenant
,
fiercely
,
"
or
I
will
have
your
viperous
tongue
torn
out
by
the
roots
.
<EOS>
"Turning
<EOS>
to
the
officer
,
he
demanded
his
warrant
,
and
glancing
at
it
,
gave
some
directions
to
one
of
the
warders
,
and
then
resumed
his
scrutiny
of
Fawkes
,
who
appeared
wholly
unmoved
,
and
steadily
returned
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
several
of
the
spectators
,
eager
to
prove
their
loyalty
to
the
king
,
and
abhorrence
of
the
plot
,
loaded
the
prisoner
with
execrations
,
and
finding
these
produced
no
effect
,
proceeded
to
personal
outrage
.
<EOS>
Some
spat
upon
his
face
and
garments
;
some
threw
mud
,
gathered
from
the
slimy
steps
,
upon
him
;
some
pricked
him
with
the
points
of
their
halberds
;
while
others
,
if
they
had
not
been
checked
,
would
have
resorted
to
greater
violence
.
<EOS>
Only
one
bystander
expressed
the
slightest
commiseration
for
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
Ruth
Ipgreve
,
who
,
with
her
parents
,
formed
part
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
A
few
kindly
words
pronounced
by
this
girl
moved
the
prisoner
more
than
all
the
insults
he
had
just
experienced
.
<EOS>
He
said
nothing
,
but
a
slight
and
almost
imperceptible
quivering
of
the
lip
told
what
was
passing
within
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
was
extremely
indignant
at
his
daughter
's
conduct
,
fearing
it
might
prejudice
him
in
the
eyes
of
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"Get
<EOS>
hence
,
girl
,
"
he
cried
,
"
and
stir
not
from
thy
room
for
the
rest
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
I
allowed
thee
to
come
forth
.
<EOS>
""You
must
look
to
her
,
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
"
said
Sir
William
Waad
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
No
man
shall
hold
an
office
in
the
Tower
who
is
a
favourer
of
papacy
.
<EOS>
If
you
were
a
good
Protestant
,
and
a
faithful
servant
of
King
James
,
your
daughter
could
never
have
acted
thus
unbecomingly
.
<EOS>
Look
to
her
,
I
say,—and
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
,
honourable
sir
,
"
replied
Jasper
,
in
great
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
Take
her
home
directly
,
"
he
added
,
in
an
under
tone
to
his
wife
.
"
<EOS>
Lock
her
up
till
I
return
,
and
scourge
her
if
thou
wilt
.
<EOS>
She
will
ruin
us
by
her
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
obedience
to
this
injunction
,
Dame
Ipgreve
seized
her
daughter
's
hand
,
and
dragged
her
away
.
<EOS>
Ruth
turned
for
a
moment
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
prisoner
,
and
saw
that
his
gaze
followed
her
,
and
was
fraught
with
an
expression
of
the
deepest
gratitude
.
<EOS>
By
way
of
showing
his
disapproval
of
his
daughter
's
conduct
,
the
jailer
now
joined
the
bitterest
of
Guy
Fawkes
's
assailants
;
and
ere
long
the
assemblage
became
infuriated
to
such
an
ungovernable
pitch
,
that
the
lieutenant
,
who
had
allowed
matters
to
proceed
thus
far
in
the
hope
of
shaking
the
prisoner
's
constancy
,
finding
his
design
fruitless
,
ordered
him
to
be
taken
away
.
<EOS>
Escorted
by
a
dozen
soldiers
with
calivers
on
their
shoulders
,
Guy
Fawkes
was
led
through
the
archway
of
the
Bloody
Tower
,
and
across
the
Green
to
the
Beauchamp
Tower
.
<EOS>
He
was
placed
in
the
spacious
chamber
on
the
first
floor
of
that
fortification
,
now
used
as
a
mess
-
room
by
the
Guards
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Waad
followed
him
,
and
seating
himself
at
a
table
,
referred
to
the
warrant
.
<EOS>
"You
are
here
called
John
Johnson
.
<EOS>
Is
that
your
name
?
"
<EOS>
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
"If
you
find
it
thus
written
,
you
need
make
no
further
inquiry
from
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
person
so
described
.
<EOS>
That
is
sufficient
for
you
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
the
lieutenant
;
"
and
if
you
persist
in
this
stubborn
demeanour
,
the
severest
measures
will
be
adopted
towards
you
.
<EOS>
Your
sole
chance
of
avoiding
the
torture
is
in
making
a
full
confession
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
desire
to
avoid
the
torture
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
wrest
nothing
from
me
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
all
think
till
they
have
experienced
it
,
"
replied
the
lieutenant
;
"
but
greater
fortitude
than
yours
has
given
way
before
our
engines
.
<EOS>
"Fawkes
<EOS>
smiled
disdainfully
,
but
made
no
answer
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
then
gave
directions
that
he
should
be
placed
within
a
small
cell
adjoining
the
larger
chamber
,
and
that
two
of
the
guard
should
remain
constantly
beside
him
,
to
prevent
him
from
doing
himself
any
violence
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
have
no
fear
,
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
destroy
my
chance
of
martyrdom
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
juncture
a
messenger
arrived
,
bearing
a
despatch
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
broke
the
seal
,
and
after
hurriedly
perusing
it
,
drew
his
sword
,
and
desiring
the
guard
to
station
themselves
outside
the
door
,
approached
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Notwithstanding
<EOS>
the
enormity
of
your
offence
<EOS>
,
"
he
observed
,
"
I
find
his
Majesty
will
graciously
spare
your
life
,
provided
you
will
reveal
the
names
of
all
your
associates
,
and
disclose
every
particular
connected
with
the
plot
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
appeared
lost
in
reflection
,
and
the
lieutenant
,
conceiving
he
had
made
an
impression
upon
him
,
repeated
the
offer
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
am
I
to
be
assured
of
this
?
"
asked
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
promise
must
suffice
,
"
rejoined
Waad
.
<EOS>
"It
will
not
suffice
to
me
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
have
a
pardon
signed
by
the
King
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
on
one
condition
,
"
replied
Waad
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
evidently
troubled
with
few
scruples
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
conviction
that
the
heads
of
many
important
Catholic
families
are
connected
with
this
plot
.
<EOS>
If
they
should
prove
to
be
so,—or
,
to
be
plain
,
if
you
will
accuse
certain
persons
whom
I
will
specify
,
you
shall
have
the
pardon
you
require
.
<EOS>
""Is
<EOS>
this
the
purport
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
despatch
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
nodded
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
look
at
it
,
"
continued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
be
practising
upon
me
.
<EOS>
""Your
own
perfidious
nature
<EOS>
makes
you
suspicious
of
treachery
in
others
,
"
cried
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
Will
this
satisfy
you?"And
he
held
the
letter
towards
Guy
Fawkes
,
who
instantly
snatched
it
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"What
ho
!
"
<EOS>
he
shouted
in
a
loud
voice
;
"
what
ho
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
guards
instantly
rushed
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
learn
why
you
were
sent
away
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Waad
has
offered
me
my
life
,
on
the
part
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
provided
I
will
accuse
certain
innocent
parties
—
innocent
,
except
that
they
are
Catholics
—
of
being
leagued
with
me
in
my
design
.
<EOS>
Read
this
letter
,
and
see
whether
I
speak
not
the
truth
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
threw
it
among
them
.
<EOS>
But
no
one
stirred
,
except
a
warder
,
who
,
picking
it
up
,
delivered
it
to
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"You
will
now
understand
whom
you
have
to
deal
with
,
"
pursued
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
Waad
.
<EOS>
"
But
were
you
as
unyielding
as
the
walls
of
this
prison
,
I
would
shake
your
obduracy
.
<EOS>
""I
pray
you
not
to
delay
the
experiment
,
"
said
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
a
little
patience
,
"
retorted
Waad
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
balk
your
humour
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
departed
,
and
repairing
to
his
lodgings
,
wrote
a
hasty
despatch
to
the
Earl
,
detailing
all
that
had
passed
,
and
requesting
a
warrant
for
the
torture
,
as
he
was
apprehensive
,
if
the
prisoner
expired
under
the
severe
application
that
would
be
necessary
to
force
the
truth
from
him
,
he
might
be
called
to
account
.
<EOS>
Two
hours
afterwards
the
messenger
returned
with
the
warrant
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
handwriting
of
the
King
,
and
contained
a
list
of
interrogations
to
be
put
to
the
prisoner
,
concluding
by
directing
him
"
to
use
the
gentler
torture
first
,
et
sic
per
gradus
ad
<EOS>
i
m
a
tenditur
.
<EOS>
And
so
God
speed
you
in
your
good
work!"Thus
armed
,
and
fearless
of
the
consequences
,
the
lieutenant
summoned
Jasper
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"We
have
a
very
refractory
prisoner
to
deal
with
,
"
he
said
,
as
the
jailer
appeared
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
just
received
the
royal
authority
to
put
him
through
all
the
degrees
of
torture
if
he
continues
obstinate
.
<EOS>
How
shall
we
begin?""With
the
Scavenger
's
Daughter
and
the
Little
Ease
,
if
it
please
you
,
honourable
sir
,
"
replied
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
If
these
fail
,
we
can
try
the
gauntlets
and
the
rack
;
and
lastly
,
the
dungeon
among
the
rats
,
and
the
hot
stone
.
<EOS>
""A
good
progression
,
"
said
the
lieutenant
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
now
repair
to
the
torture
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Let
the
prisoner
be
brought
there
without
delay
.
<EOS>
He
is
in
the
Beauchamp
Tower
.
<EOS>
"Ipgreve
bowed
and
departed
,
while
the
lieutenant
,
calling
to
an
attendant
to
bring
a
torch
,
proceeded
along
a
narrow
passage
communicating
with
the
Bell
Tower
.
<EOS>
Opening
a
secret
door
within
it
,
he
descended
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
and
traversing
a
number
of
intricate
passages
,
at
length
stopped
before
a
strong
door
,
which
he
pushed
aside
,
and
entered
the
chamber
he
had
mentioned
to
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
This
dismal
apartment
has
already
been
described
.
<EOS>
It
was
that
in
which
Viviana
's
constancy
was
so
fearfully
approved
.
<EOS>
Two
officials
in
the
peculiar
garb
of
the
place
—
a
sable
livery
—
were
occupied
in
polishing
the
various
steel
implements
.
<EOS>
Besides
these
,
there
was
the
chirurgeon
,
who
was
seated
at
a
side
table
,
reading
by
the
light
of
a
brazen
lamp
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
arose
on
seeing
the
lieutenant
,
and
began
,
with
the
other
officials
,
to
make
preparations
for
the
prisoner
's
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
two
latter
concealed
their
features
by
drawing
a
large
black
capoch
,
or
hood
,
attached
to
their
gowns
over
them
,
and
this
disguise
added
materially
to
their
lugubrious
appearance
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
then
took
down
a
broad
iron
hoop
,
opening
in
the
centre
with
a
hinge
,
and
held
it
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Their
preparations
were
scarcely
completed
when
heavy
footsteps
announced
the
approach
of
Fawkes
and
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
Jasper
Ipgreve
ushered
them
into
the
chamber
,
and
fastened
the
door
behind
them
.
<EOS>
All
the
subsequent
proceedings
were
conducted
with
the
utmost
deliberation
,
and
were
therefore
doubly
impressive
.
<EOS>
No
undue
haste
occurred
,
and
the
officials
,
who
might
have
been
mistaken
for
phantoms
or
evil
spirits
,
spoke
only
in
whispers
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
watched
their
movements
with
unaltered
composure
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
Jasper
Ipgreve
signified
to
the
lieutenant
that
all
was
ready
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
opportunity
you
desired
of
having
your
courage
put
to
the
test
is
now
arrived
,
"
said
the
latter
to
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"What
am
I
to
do
?
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"Remove
<EOS>
your
doublet
,
and
prostrate
yourself
,
"
subjoined
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
obeyed
,
and
when
in
this
posture
began
audibly
to
recite
a
prayer
to
the
Virgin
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
silent
,
"
cried
the
lieutenant
,
"
or
a
gag
shall
be
thrust
into
your
mouth
.
<EOS>
"Kneeling
<EOS>
upon
the
prisoner
's
shoulders
,
and
passing
the
hoop
under
his
legs
,
Ipgreve
then
succeeded
,
with
the
help
of
his
assistants
,
who
added
their
weight
to
his
own
,
in
fastening
the
hoop
with
an
iron
button
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
left
the
prisoner
with
his
limbs
and
body
so
tightly
compressed
together
that
he
was
scarcely
able
to
breathe
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
he
was
allowed
to
remain
for
an
hour
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
The
chirurgeon
then
found
on
examination
that
the
blood
had
burst
profusely
from
his
mouth
and
nostrils
,
and
in
a
slighter
degree
from
the
extremities
of
his
hands
and
feet
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
must
be
released
,
"
he
observed
in
an
under
tone
to
the
lieutenant
.
"
<EOS>
Further
continuance
might
be
fatal
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
<EOS>
,
the
hoop
was
removed
,
and
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
prisoner
underwent
the
severest
trial
.
<EOS>
Despite
his
efforts
to
control
himself
,
a
sharp
convulsion
passed
across
his
frame
,
and
the
restoration
of
impeded
circulation
and
respiration
occasioned
him
the
most
acute
agony
.
<EOS>
The
chirurgeon
bathed
his
temples
with
vinegar
,
and
his
limbs
being
chafed
by
the
officials
,
he
was
placed
on
a
bench
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
warrant
directs
me
to
begin
with
the
'
gentler
tortures
,
'
and
to
proceed
by
degrees
to
extremities
,
"
observed
the
lieutenant
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
now
had
a
taste
of
the
milder
sort
,
and
may
form
some
conjecture
what
the
worst
are
like
.
<EOS>
Do
you
still
continue
contumacious?""I
am
in
the
same
mind
as
before
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
in
a
hoarse
but
firm
voice
.
<EOS>
"Take
him
to
the
Little
Ease
,
and
let
him
pass
the
night
there
,
"
said
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
I
will
continue
the
investigation
.
<EOS>
"Fawkes
was
then
led
out
by
Ipgreve
and
the
officials
,
and
conveyed
along
a
narrow
passage
,
until
arriving
at
a
low
door
,
in
which
there
was
an
iron
grating
,
it
was
opened
,
and
disclosed
a
narrow
cell
about
four
feet
high
,
one
and
a
few
inches
wide
,
and
two
deep
.
<EOS>
Into
this
narrow
receptacle
,
which
seemed
wholly
inadequate
to
contain
a
tall
and
strongly
-
built
man
like
himself
,
the
prisoner
was
with
some
difficulty
thrust
,
and
the
door
locked
upon
him
.
<EOS>
In
this
miserable
plight
,
with
his
head
bent
upon
his
breast,—the
cell
being
so
contrived
that
its
wretched
inmate
could
neither
sit
,
nor
recline
at
full
length
within
it,—Guy
Fawkes
prayed
long
and
fervently
;
and
no
longer
troubled
by
the
uneasy
feelings
which
had
for
some
time
haunted
him
,
he
felt
happier
in
his
present
forlorn
condition
than
he
had
been
when
anticipating
the
full
success
of
his
project
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
least
,
"
he
thought
,
"
I
shall
now
win
myself
a
crown
of
martyrdom
,
and
whatever
my
present
sufferings
may
be
,
they
will
be
speedily
effaced
by
the
happiness
I
shall
enjoy
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"Overcome
,
at
length
,
by
weariness
and
exhaustion
,
he
fell
into
a
sort
of
doze
—
it
could
scarcely
be
called
sleep
—
and
while
in
this
state
,
fancied
he
was
visited
by
Saint
Winifred
,
who
,
approaching
the
door
of
the
cell
,
touched
it
,
and
it
instantly
opened
.
<EOS>
She
then
placed
her
hand
upon
his
limbs
,
and
the
pain
he
had
hitherto
felt
in
them
subsided
.
<EOS>
"Your
troubles
will
soon
be
over
,
"
murmured
the
saint
,
"
and
you
will
be
at
rest
.
<EOS>
Do
not
hesitate
to
confess
.
<EOS>
Your
silence
will
neither
serve
your
companions
nor
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
the
vision
disappeared
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
awoke
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
the
effect
of
imagination
,
or
that
his
robust
constitution
had
in
reality
shaken
off
the
effects
of
the
torture
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
,
but
it
is
certain
that
he
felt
his
strength
restored
to
him
,
and
attributing
his
recovery
entirely
to
the
marvellous
interposition
of
the
saint
,
he
addressed
a
prayer
of
gratitude
to
her
.
<EOS>
While
thus
occupied
,
he
heard
—
for
it
was
so
dark
he
could
distinguish
nothing
—
a
sweet
low
voice
at
the
grating
of
the
cell
,
and
imagining
it
was
the
same
benign
presence
as
before
,
paused
and
listened
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
hear
me
?
"
asked
the
voice
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
Is
it
the
blessed
Winifred
,
who
again
vouchsafes
to
address
me?""Alas
,
no
!
"
replied
the
voice
;
"
it
is
one
of
mortal
mould
.
<EOS>
I
am
Ruth
Ipgreve
,
the
jailer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
You
may
remember
that
I
expressed
some
sympathy
in
your
behalf
at
your
landing
at
Traitor
's
Gate
to
-
day
,
for
which
I
incurred
my
father
's
displeasure
.
<EOS>
But
you
will
be
quite
sure
I
am
a
friend
,
when
I
tell
you
I
assisted
Viviana
Radcliffe
to
escape
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Guy
Fawkes
,
in
a
tone
of
great
emotion
.
<EOS>
"I
was
in
some
degree
in
her
confidence
,
"
pursued
Ruth
;
"
and
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
you
are
the
object
of
her
warmest
regard
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prisoner
could
not
repress
a
groan
.
<EOS>
"You
are
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
pursued
Ruth
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
you
need
have
no
fear
of
me
.
<EOS>
I
have
risked
my
life
for
Viviana
,
and
would
risk
it
for
you
.
<EOS>
""I
will
disguise
nothing
from
you
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
he
you
have
named
.
<EOS>
As
the
husband
of
Viviana
—
for
such
I
am
—
I
feel
the
deepest
gratitude
to
you
for
the
service
you
rendered
her
.
<EOS>
She
bitterly
reproached
herself
with
having
placed
you
in
so
much
danger
.
<EOS>
How
did
you
escape?""I
was
screened
by
my
parents
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
given
out
by
them
that
Viviana
escaped
through
the
window
of
her
prison
,
and
I
was
thus
preserved
from
punishment
.
<EOS>
Where
is
she
now?""In
safety
,
I
trust
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
I
shall
never
behold
her
again
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
despair
,
"
returned
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
try
to
effect
your
liberation
;
and
though
I
have
but
<EOS>
slender
hope
of
accomplishing
it
<EOS>
,
still
there
is
a
chance
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
desire
it
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
content
to
perish
.
<EOS>
All
I
lived
for
is
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
""This
shall
not
deter
me
from
trying
to
save
you
,
"
replied
Ruth
;
"
and
I
still
trust
there
is
happiness
in
store
for
you
with
Viviana
.
<EOS>
Amid
all
your
sufferings
,
rest
certain
there
is
one
who
will
ever
watch
over
you
.
<EOS>
I
dare
not
remain
here
longer
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"She
then
departed
,
and
it
afforded
Guy
Fawkes
some
solace
to
ponder
on
the
interview
during
the
rest
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
Jasper
Ipgreve
appeared
,
and
placed
before
him
a
loaf
of
the
coarsest
bread
,
and
a
jug
of
dirty
water
.
<EOS>
His
scanty
meal
ended
,
he
left
him
,
but
returned
in
two
hours
afterwards
with
a
party
of
halberdiers
,
and
desiring
him
to
follow
him
,
led
the
way
to
the
torture
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Waad
was
there
when
he
arrived
,
and
demanding
in
a
stern
tone
whether
he
still
continued
obstinate
,
and
receiving
no
answer
,
ordered
him
to
be
placed
in
the
gauntlets
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
he
was
suspended
from
a
beam
by
his
hands
,
and
endured
five
hours
of
the
most
excruciating
agony
—
his
fingers
being
so
crushed
and
lacerated
that
he
could
not
move
them
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
taken
down
,
and
still
refusing
to
confess
,
was
conveyed
to
a
horrible
pit
,
adjoining
the
river
,
called
,
from
the
loathsome
animals
infesting
it
,
"
the
dungeon
among
the
rats
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
about
twenty
feet
wide
and
twelve
deep
,
and
at
high
tide
was
generally
more
than
two
feet
deep
in
water
.
<EOS>
Into
this
dreadful
chasm
was
Guy
Fawkes
lowered
by
his
attendants
,
who
,
warning
him
of
the
probable
fate
that
awaited
him
,
left
him
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
At
this
time
the
pit
was
free
from
water
;
but
he
had
not
been
there
more
than
an
hour
,
when
a
bubbling
and
hissing
sound
proclaimed
that
the
tide
was
rising
,
while
frequent
plashes
convinced
him
that
the
rats
were
at
hand
.
<EOS>
Stooping
down
,
he
felt
that
the
water
was
alive
with
them
—
that
they
were
all
around
him
—
and
would
not
,
probably
,
delay
their
attack
.
<EOS>
Prepared
as
he
was
for
the
worst
,
he
could
not
repress
a
shudder
at
the
prospect
of
the
horrible
death
with
which
he
was
menaced
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
he
was
surprised
by
the
appearance
of
a
light
,
and
perceived
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
a
female
figure
bearing
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
Not
doubting
it
was
his
visitant
of
the
former
night
,
he
called
out
to
her
,
and
was
answered
in
the
voice
of
Ruth
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
dare
not
remain
here
many
minutes
,
"
she
said
,
"
because
my
father
suspects
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
let
you
perish
thus
.
<EOS>
I
will
let
down
this
lantern
to
you
,
and
the
light
will
keep
away
the
rats
.
<EOS>
When
the
tide
retires
you
can
extinguish
it
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
tore
her
kerchief
into
shreds
,
and
tying
the
slips
together
,
lowered
the
lantern
to
the
prisoner
,
and
without
waiting
to
receive
his
thanks
,
hurried
away
.
<EOS>
Thus
aided
,
Guy
Fawkes
defended
himself
as
well
as
he
could
against
his
loathsome
assailants
.
<EOS>
The
light
showed
that
the
water
was
swarming
with
them
—
that
they
were
creeping
by
hundreds
up
the
sides
of
the
pit
,
and
preparing
to
make
a
general
attack
upon
him
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
Fawkes
determined
not
to
oppose
them
,
but
to
let
them
work
their
will
upon
him
;
but
the
contact
of
the
noxious
animals
made
him
change
his
resolution
,
and
he
instinctively
drove
them
off
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
,
however
,
to
be
easily
repulsed
,
and
returned
to
the
charge
with
greater
fury
than
before
.
<EOS>
The
desire
of
self
preservation
now
got
the
better
of
every
other
feeling
,
and
the
dread
of
being
devoured
alive
giving
new
vigour
to
his
crippled
limbs
,
he
rushed
to
the
other
side
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
His
persecutors
,
however
,
followed
him
in
myriads
,
springing
upon
him
,
and
making
their
sharp
teeth
meet
in
his
flesh
in
a
thousand
places
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
the
contest
continued
for
some
time
,
Guy
Fawkes
speeding
round
the
pit
,
and
his
assailants
never
for
one
moment
relaxing
in
the
pursuit
,
until
he
fell
from
exhaustion
,
and
his
lantern
being
extinguished
,
the
whole
host
darted
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Thinking
all
over
,
he
could
not
repress
a
loud
cry
,
and
it
was
scarcely
uttered
,
when
lights
appeared
,
and
several
gloomy
figures
bearing
torches
were
seen
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
.
<EOS>
Among
these
he
distinguished
Sir
William
Waad
,
who
offered
instantly
to
release
him
if
he
would
confess
.
<EOS>
"I
will
rather
perish
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
"
and
I
will
make
no
further
effort
to
defend
myself
.
<EOS>
I
shall
soon
be
out
of
the
reach
of
your
malice
.
<EOS>
""This
must
not
be
,
"
observed
the
lieutenant
to
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
who
stood
by
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Salisbury
will
never
forgive
me
if
he
perishes
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
not
a
moment
must
be
lost
,
or
those
ravenous
brutes
will
assuredly
devour
him
,
"
replied
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
so
fierce
,
that
I
scarcely
like
to
venture
among
them
.
<EOS>
"A
ladder
was
then
let
down
into
the
pit
,
and
the
jailer
and
the
two
officials
descended
.
<EOS>
They
were
just
in
time
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
had
ceased
to
struggle
,
and
the
rats
were
attacking
him
with
such
fury
that
his
words
would
have
been
speedily
verified
,
but
for
Ipgreve
's
timely
interposition
.
<EOS>
On
being
taken
out
of
the
pit
,
he
fainted
from
exhaustion
and
loss
of
blood
;
and
when
he
came
to
himself
,
found
he
was
stretched
upon
a
couch
in
the
torture
-
chamber
,
with
the
chirurgeon
and
Jasper
Ipgreve
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
Strong
broths
and
other
restoratives
were
then
administered
;
and
his
strength
being
sufficiently
restored
to
enable
him
to
converse
,
the
lieutenant
again
visited
him
,
and
questioning
him
as
before
,
received
a
similar
answer
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
that
day
and
the
next
,
he
underwent
at
intervals
various
kinds
of
torture
,
each
more
excruciating
than
the
preceding
,
all
of
which
he
bore
with
unabated
fortitude
.
<EOS>
Among
other
applications
,
the
rack
was
employed
with
such
rigour
,
that
his
joints
started
from
their
sockets
,
and
his
frame
seemed
torn
asunder
.
<EOS>
On
the
fourth
day
he
was
removed
to
another
and
yet
gloomier
chamber
,
devoted
to
the
same
dreadful
objects
as
the
first
.
<EOS>
It
had
an
arched
stone
ceiling
,
and
at
the
further
extremity
yawned
a
deep
recess
.
<EOS>
Within
this
there
was
a
small
furnace
,
in
which
fuel
was
placed
,
ready
to
be
kindled
;
and
over
the
furnace
lay
a
large
black
flag
,
at
either
end
of
which
were
stout
leathern
straps
.
<EOS>
After
being
subjected
to
the
customary
interrogations
of
the
lieutenant
,
Fawkes
was
stripped
of
his
attire
,
and
bound
to
the
flag
.
<EOS>
The
fire
was
then
lighted
,
and
the
stone
gradually
heated
.
<EOS>
The
writhing
frame
of
the
miserable
man
ere
long
showed
the
extremity
of
his
suffering
;
but
as
he
did
not
even
utter
a
groan
,
his
tormentors
were
compelled
to
release
him
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
there
were
two
personages
present
who
had
never
attended
any
previous
interrogation
.
<EOS>
They
were
wrapped
in
large
cloaks
,
and
stood
aloof
during
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Both
were
treated
with
the
most
ceremonious
respect
by
Sir
William
Waad
,
who
consulted
them
as
to
the
extent
to
which
he
should
continue
the
torture
.
<EOS>
When
the
prisoner
was
taken
off
the
heated
stone
,
one
of
those
persons
advanced
towards
him
,
and
gazed
curiously
at
him
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
,
upon
whose
brow
thick
drops
were
standing
,
and
who
was
sinking
into
the
oblivion
brought
on
by
overwrought
endurance
,
exclaimed
,
"
It
is
the
King
;
"
and
fainted
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
traitor
knew
your
Majesty
,
"
said
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
see
it
is
in
vain
to
attempt
to
extort
anything
from
him
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
it
seems
,
"
replied
James
;
"
and
I
am
greatly
disappointed
,
for
I
was
led
to
believe
that
I
should
hear
a
full
confession
of
the
conspiracy
from
his
own
lips
.
<EOS>
How
say
you
,
good
Master
chirurgeon
,
will
he
endure
further
torture?""Not
without
danger
of
life
,
your
Majesty
,
unless
he
has
some
days
'
repose
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
,
"
even
if
he
can
endure
it
then
.
<EOS>
""It
will
not
be
necessary
to
apply
it
further
,
"
replied
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
now
in
full
possession
of
the
names
of
all
the
principal
conspirators
;
and
when
the
prisoner
finds
further
concealment
useless
,
he
will
change
his
tone
.
<EOS>
To
-
morrow
,
the
commissioners
appointed
by
your
Majesty
for
the
examination
of
all
those
concerned
in
this
dreadful
project
,
will
interrogate
him
in
the
lieutenant
's
lodgings
,
and
I
will
answer
with
my
life
that
the
result
will
be
satisfactory
.
<EOS>
""Enough
,
"
said
James
.
<EOS>
"
It
has
been
a
painful
spectacle
which
we
have
just
witnessed
,
and
yet
we
would
not
have
missed
it
.
<EOS>
The
wretch
possesses
undaunted
resolution
,
and
we
can
never
be
sufficiently
grateful
to
the
beneficent
Providence
that
prevented
him
from
working
his
ruthless
purpose
upon
us
.
<EOS>
The
day
on
which
we
were
preserved
from
this
Gunpowder
Treason
shall
ever
hereafter
be
kept
sacred
in
our
church
,
and
thanks
shall
be
returned
to
Heaven
for
our
wonderful
deliverance
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
Majesty
will
act
wisely
,
"
replied
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
The
Ordinance
will
impress
the
nation
with
a
salutary
horror
of
all
Papists
and
traitors,—for
they
are
one
and
the
same
thing,—and
<EOS>
keep
alive
a
proper
feeling
of
enmity
against
them
.
<EOS>
Such
a
fearful
example
shall
be
made
of
these
miscreants
as
shall
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
deter
all
others
from
following
their
cause
.
<EOS>
Not
only
shall
they
perish
infamously
,
but
their
names
shall
for
ever
be
held
in
execration
.
<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
rejoined
James
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
good
legal
maxim
—
Crescente
malitiâ

<EOS>
crescere
debuit
et
poena

"Upon
<EOS>
this
,
he
left
the
chamber
,
and
,
traversing
a
number
of
subterranean
passages
with
his
attendants
,
crossed
the
drawbridge
near
the
Byward
Tower
to
the
wharf
,
where
his
barge
was
waiting
for
him
,
and
returned
in
it
to
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
At
an
early
hour
on
the
following
day
,
the
commissioners
appointed
to
the
examination
of
the
prisoner
,
met
together
in
a
large
room
on
the
second
floor
of
the
lieutenant
's
lodgings
,
afterwards
denominated
,
from
its
use
on
this
occasion
,
the
Council
Chamber
.
<EOS>
Affixed
to
the
walls
of
this
room
may
be
seen
at
the
present
day
a
piece
of
marble
sculpture
,
with
an
inscription
commemorative
of
the
event
.
<EOS>
The
commissioners
were
nine
in
number
,
and
included
the
Earls
of
Salisbury
,
Northampton
,
Nottingham
,
Suffolk
,
Worcester
,
Devon
,
Marr
,
and
Dunbar
,
and
Sir
John
Popham
,
Lord
Chief
Justice
.
<EOS>
With
these
were
associated
Sir
Edward
Coke
,
attorney
-
general
,
and
Sir
William
Waad
.
<EOS>
The
apartment
in
which
the
examination
took
place
is
still
a
spacious
one
,
but
at
the
period
in
question
it
was
much
larger
and
loftier
.
<EOS>
The
walls
were
panelled
with
dark
lustrous
oak
,
covered
in
some
places
with
tapestry
,
and
adorned
in
others
with
paintings
.
<EOS>
Over
the
chimney
-
piece
hung
a
portrait
of
the
late
sovereign
,
Elizabeth
.
<EOS>
The
commissioners
were
grouped
round
a
large
heavily
carved
oak
table
,
and
,
after
some
deliberation
together
,
it
was
agreed
that
the
prisoner
should
be
introduced
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Waad
then
motioned
to
Topcliffe
,
who
was
in
attendance
with
half
a
dozen
halberdiers
,
and
a
few
moments
afterwards
a
panel
was
pushed
aside
,
and
Guy
Fawkes
was
brought
through
it
.
<EOS>
He
was
supported
by
Topcliffe
and
Ipgreve
,
and
it
was
with
the
greatest
difficulty
he
could
drag
himself
along
.
<EOS>
So
severe
had
been
the
sufferings
to
which
he
had
been
subjected
,
that
they
had
done
the
work
of
time
,
and
placed
more
than
twenty
years
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
thin
and
sharp
,
and
of
a
ghastly
whiteness
,
and
his
eyes
hollow
and
bloodshot
.
<EOS>
A
large
cloak
was
thrown
over
him
,
which
partially
concealed
his
shattered
frame
and
crippled
limbs
;
but
his
bent
shoulders
,
and
the
difficulty
with
which
he
moved
,
told
how
much
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
the
presence
in
which
he
stood
,
a
flush
for
a
moment
rose
to
his
pallid
cheek
,
his
eye
glowed
with
its
wonted
fire
,
and
he
tried
to
stand
erect
—
but
his
limbs
refused
their
office
—
and
the
effort
was
so
painful
,
that
he
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
his
attendants
.
<EOS>
He
was
thus
borne
forward
by
them
,
and
supported
during
his
examination
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Salisbury
then
addressed
him
,
and
enlarging
on
the
magnitude
and
horrible
nature
of
his
treason
,
concluded
by
saying
that
the
only
reparation
he
could
offer
was
to
disclose
not
only
all
his
own
criminal
intentions
,
but
the
names
of
his
associates
.
<EOS>
"I
will
hide
nothing
concerning
myself
,
"
replied
Fawkes
;
"
but
I
shall
be
for
ever
silent
respecting
others
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
Earl
then
glanced
at
Sir
Edward
Coke
,
who
proceeded
to
take
down
minutes
of
the
examination
.
<EOS>
"You
have
hitherto
falsely
represented
yourself
,
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
your
real
name?""Guy
Fawkes
,
"
replied
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
do
you
confess
your
guilt
?
"
pursued
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
admit
that
it
was
my
intention
to
blow
up
the
King
and
the
whole
of
the
lords
spiritual
and
temporal
assembled
in
the
Parliament
House
with
gunpowder
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
placed
the
combustibles
in
the
vault
where
they
were
discovered
?
"
demanded
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
answered
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"You
are
a
Papist
?
"
continued
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"I
am
a
member
of
the
Church
of
Rome
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
regard
this
monstrous
design
as
righteous
and
laudable
—
as
consistent
with
the
religion
you
profess
,
and
as
likely
to
uphold
it
?
"
said
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
did
so
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
am
now
convinced
that
Heaven
did
not
approve
it
,
and
I
lament
that
it
was
ever
undertaken
.
<EOS>
""Still
,
you
refuse
to
make
the
only
reparation
in
your
power
—
you
refuse
to
disclose
your
associates
?
"
said
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
betray
them
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Traitor
!
<EOS>
it
is
needless
,
"
cried
the
Earl
;
"
they
are
known
to
us
—
<EOS>
nay
,
they
have
betrayed
themselves
.
<EOS>
They
have
risen
in
open
and
armed
rebellion
against
the
King
;
but
a
sufficient
power
has
been
sent
against
them
;
and
if
they
are
not
ere
this
defeated
and
captured
,
many
days
will
not
elapse
before
they
will
be
lodged
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
this
is
the
case
,
you
require
no
information
from
me
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
pray
you
name
them
to
me
.
<EOS>
""I
will
do
so
,
"
replied
Salisbury
;
"
and
if
I
have
omitted
you
can
supply
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
I
will
begin
with
Robert
Catesby
,
the
chief
contriver
of
this
hell
-
engendered
plot,—I
<EOS>
will
next
proceed
to
the
superior
of
the
Jesuits
,
Father
Garnet,—next
,
to
another
Jesuit
priest
,
Father
Oldcorne,—next
,
to
Sir
Everard
Digby,—then
,
to
Thomas
Winter
and
Robert
Winter,—then
,
to
John
Wright
and
Christopher
<EOS>
Wright,—then
,
to
Ambrose
Rookwood
,
Thomas
Percy
,
and
John
Grant
,
and
lastly
,
to
Robert
Keyes
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
these
all
?
"
demanded
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
we
are
acquainted
with
,
"
said
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"Then
add
to
them
the
names
of
Francis
Tresham
,
and
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
Lord
Mounteagle
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
charge
both
with
being
privy
to
the
plot
.
<EOS>
""I
have
forgotten
another
name
,
"
said
Salisbury
,
in
some
confusion
,
"
that
of
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
of
Ordsall
Hall
.
<EOS>
I
have
received
certain
information
that
she
was
wedded
to
you
while
you
were
resident
at
White
Webbs
,
near
Epping
Forest
,
and
was
cognisant
of
the
plot
.
<EOS>
If
captured
,
she
will
share
your
fate
.
<EOS>
"Fawkes
<EOS>
could
not
repress
a
groan
.
<EOS>
Salisbury
pursued
his
interrogations
,
but
it
was
evident
,
from
the
increasing
feebleness
of
the
prisoner
,
that
he
would
sink
under
it
if
the
examination
was
further
protracted
.
<EOS>
He
was
therefore
ordered
to
attach
his
signature
to
the
minutes
taken
by
Sir
Edward
Coke
,
and
was
placed
in
a
chair
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
A
pen
was
then
given
him
,
but
for
some
time
his
shattered
fingers
refused
to
grasp
it
.
<EOS>
By
a
great
effort
,
and
with
acute
pain
,
he
succeeded
in
tracing
his
Christian
name
thus:—IllustrationWhile
endeavouring
to
write
his
surname
,
the
pen
fell
from
his
hand
,
and
he
became
insensible

—
SHOWING
THE
TROUBLES
OF
VIVIANAOn
coming
to
herself
,
Viviana
inquired
for
Garnet
;
and
being
told
that
he
was
in
his
chamber
alone
,
she
repaired
thither
,
and
found
him
pacing
to
and
fro
in
the
greatest
perturbation
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
come
to
me
for
consolation
,
daughter
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
come
to
one
who
can
not
offer
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
completely
prostrated
in
spirit
by
the
disastrous
issue
of
our
enterprise
;
and
though
I
tried
to
prepare
myself
for
what
has
taken
place
,
I
now
find
myself
utterly
unable
to
cope
with
it
.
<EOS>
"Illustration"If
<EOS>
such
is
your
condition
,
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
what
must
be
that
of
my
husband
,
upon
whose
devoted
head
all
the
weight
of
this
dreadful
calamity
now
falls
?
<EOS>
You
are
still
at
liberty
—
still
able
to
save
yourself
—
still
able
,
at
least
,
to
resist
unto
the
death
,
if
you
are
so
minded
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
a
captive
in
the
Tower
,
exposed
to
every
torment
that
human
ingenuity
can
invent
,
and
with
nothing
but
the
prospect
of
a
lingering
death
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
What
is
your
condition
,
compared
with
his?""Happy
—
most
happy
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
"
and
I
have
been
selfish
and
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
given
way
to
the
weakness
of
humanity
,
and
I
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
for
enabling
me
to
shake
it
off
.
<EOS>
""You
have
indulged
false
hopes
,
father
,
"
said
Viviana
,
"
whereas
I
have
indulged
none
,
or
rather
,
all
has
come
to
pass
as
I
desired
.
<EOS>
The
dreadful
crime
with
which
I
feared
my
husband
's
soul
would
have
been
loaded
is
now
uncommitted
,
and
I
have
firm
hope
of
his
salvation
.
<EOS>
If
I
might
counsel
you
,
I
would
advise
you
to
surrender
yourself
to
justice
,
and
by
pouring
out
your
blood
on
the
scaffold
,
wash
out
your
offence
.
<EOS>
Such
will
be
my
own
course
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
involuntarily
led
into
connexion
with
this
plot
;
and
though
I
have
ever
disapproved
of
it
,
since
I
have
not
revealed
it
I
am
as
guilty
as
if
I
had
been
its
contriver
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
shun
my
punishment
.
<EOS>
Fate
has
dealt
hardly
with
me
,
and
my
path
on
earth
has
been
strewn
with
thorns
,
and
cast
in
grief
and
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
I
humbly
trust
that
my
portion
hereafter
will
be
with
the
blessed
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
doubt
it
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
and
though
I
do
not
view
our
design
in
the
light
that
you
do
,
but
regard
it
as
justifiable
,
if
not
necessary
,
yet
,
with
your
feelings
,
I
can
not
sufficiently
admire
your
conduct
.
<EOS>
Your
devotion
and
self
-
sacrifice
is
wholly
without
parallel
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
I
would
try
to
dissuade
you
from
surrendering
yourself
to
our
relentless
enemies
.
<EOS>
Believe
me
,
it
will
add
the
severest
pang
to
your
husband
's
torture
to
know
that
you
are
in
their
power
.
<EOS>
His
nature
is
stern
and
unyielding
,
and
,
persuaded
as
he
is
of
the
justice
of
his
cause
,
he
will
die
happy
in
that
conviction
,
certain
that
his
name
,
though
despised
by
our
heretical
persecutors
,
will
be
held
in
reverence
by
all
true
professors
of
our
faith
.
<EOS>
No
,
daughter
,
fly
and
conceal
yourself
till
pursuit
is
relinquished
,
and
pass
the
rest
of
your
life
in
prayer
for
the
repose
of
your
husband
's
soul
.
<EOS>
""I
will
pass
it
in
endeavouring
to
bring
him
to
repentance
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sole
boon
I
shall
seek
from
my
judges
will
be
permission
to
attempt
this
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
refused
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
"
and
you
will
only
destroy
yourself
,
not
aid
him
.
<EOS>
Rest
satisfied
that
the
Great
Power
who
judges
the
hearts
of
men
,
and
implants
certain
impulses
within
them
,
for
his
own
wise
but
inscrutable
purposes
,
well
knows
that
Guy
Fawkes
,
however
culpable
his
conduct
may
appear
in
your
eyes
,
<EOS>
acted
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
conscience
,
and
in
the
full
confidence
that
the
design
would
restore
the
true
worship
of
God
in
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
The
failure
of
the
enterprise
proves
that
he
was
mistaken
—
that
we
were
all
mistaken,—and
that
Heaven
was
unfavourable
to
the
means
<EOS>
adopted,—but
<EOS>
it
does
not
prove
his
insincerity
.
<EOS>
""These
arguments
have
no
weight
with
me
,
father
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
I
will
leave
nothing
undone
to
save
his
soul
,
and
whatever
may
be
the
result
,
I
will
surrender
myself
to
justice
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
not
seek
to
move
you
from
your
purpose
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
"
and
can
only
lament
it
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
you
finally
decide
,
let
us
pray
together
for
directions
from
on
high
.
<EOS>
"Thus
<EOS>
exhorted
,
Viviana
knelt
down
with
the
priest
before
a
small
silver
image
of
the
Virgin
,
which
stood
in
a
niche
in
the
wall
,
and
they
both
prayed
long
and
earnestly
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
the
first
to
conclude
his
devotions
;
and
as
he
gazed
at
the
upturned
countenance
and
streaming
eyes
of
his
companion
,
his
heart
was
filled
with
admiration
and
pity
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
the
door
opened
,
and
Catesby
and
Sir
Everard
Digby
entered
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
them
,
Viviana
immediately
arose
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
urgency
of
our
business
must
plead
an
excuse
for
the
interruption
,
if
any
is
needed
,
"
said
Catesby
;
"
but
do
not
retire
,
madam
.
<EOS>
We
have
no
secrets
from
you
now
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
and
I
have
fully
completed
our
preparations
,
"
he
added
,
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
Our
men
are
all
armed
and
mounted
in
the
court
,
and
are
in
high
spirits
for
the
enterprise
.
<EOS>
As
the
service
,
however
,
will
be
one
of
the
greatest
danger
and
difficulty
,
you
had
better
seek
a
safe
asylum
,
father
,
till
the
first
decisive
blow
is
struck
.
<EOS>
""I
would
go
with
you
,
my
son
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
"
if
I
did
not
think
my
presence
might
be
an
hinderance
.
<EOS>
I
can
only
aid
you
with
my
prayers
,
and
those
can
be
more
efficaciously
uttered
in
some
secure
retreat
,
than
during
a
rapid
march
or
dangerous
encounter
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
had
better
retire
to
Coughton
with
Lady
Digby
and
Viviana
,
"
said
Sir
Everard
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
provided
a
sufficient
escort
to
guard
you
thither,—and
,
as
you
are
aware
,
there
are
many
hiding
-
places
in
the
house
,
where
you
can
remain
undiscovered
in
case
of
search
.
<EOS>
""I
place
myself
at
your
disposal
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
But
Viviana
is
resolved
to
surrender
herself
.
<EOS>
""This
must
not
be
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
Such
an
act
at
this
juncture
would
be
madness
,
and
would
materially
injure
our
cause
.
<EOS>
Whatever
your
inclinations
may
prompt
,
you
must
consent
to
remain
in
safety
,
madam
.
<EOS>
""I
have
acquiesced
in
your
proceedings
thus
far
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
because
I
could
not
oppose
them
without
injury
to
those
dear
to
me
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
take
no
further
share
in
them
.
<EOS>
My
mind
is
made
up
as
to
the
course
I
shall
pursue
.
<EOS>
""Since
you
are
bent
upon
your
own
destruction,—for
<EOS>
it
is
nothing
less,—it
is
the
duty
of
your
friends
to
save
you
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
not
do
what
you
propose
,
and
when
you
are
yourself
again
,
and
have
recovered
from
the
shock
your
feelings
have
sustained
,
you
will
thank
me
for
my
interference
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
Catesby
,
"
observed
Sir
Everard
;
"
it
would
be
worse
than
insanity
to
allow
her
to
destroy
herself
thus
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
you
are
of
this
opinion
,
"
said
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
tried
to
reason
her
out
of
her
design
,
but
without
avail
.
<EOS>
""Catesby
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
throwing
herself
at
his
feet
,
"
by
the
love
you
once
professed
for
me,—by
the
friendship
you
entertained
for
him
who
unhesitatingly
offered
himself
for
you
,
and
your
cause
,
I
implore
you
not
to
oppose
me
now!""I
shall
best
serve
you
,
and
most
act
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
my
friend
,
by
doing
so
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Therefore
,
you
plead
in
vain
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
My
purposes
are
ever
thwarted
.
<EOS>
You
will
have
to
answer
for
my
life
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
should
,
indeed
,
have
it
to
answer
for
,
if
I
permitted
you
to
act
as
you
desire
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
repeat
you
will
thank
me
ere
many
days
are
passed
.
<EOS>
""Sir
Everard
,
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
appealing
to
the
knight
,
"
I
entreat
you
to
have
pity
upon
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
sincerely
sympathise
with
your
distress
,
"
replied
Digby
,
in
a
tone
of
the
deepest
commiseration
;
"
but
I
am
sure
what
Catesby
advises
is
for
the
best
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
reconcile
it
to
my
conscience
to
allow
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
thus
.
<EOS>
Be
governed
by
prudence
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
no
——
no
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
be
stayed
.
<EOS>
I
command
you
not
to
detain
me
.
<EOS>
""Viviana
,
"
said
Catesby
,
taking
her
arm
,
"
this
is
no
season
for
the
display
of
silly
weakness
either
on
our
part
or
yours
.
<EOS>
If
you
can
not
control
yourself
,
you
must
be
controlled
.
<EOS>
Father
Garnet
,
I
intrust
her
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
Two
of
my
troop
shall
attend
you
,
together
with
your
own
servant
,
Nicholas
Owen
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
stout
horses
,
able
to
accomplish
the
journey
with
the
greatest
expedition
,
and
I
should
wish
you
to
convey
her
to
her
own
mansion
,
Ordsall
Hall
,
and
to
remain
there
with
her
till
you
hear
tidings
of
us
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
be
as
you
direct
,
my
son
,
"
said
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
prepared
to
set
out
at
once
.
<EOS>
""That
is
well
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
do
me
this
violence
,
sir
,
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
appeal
against
it
,
to
you
,
Sir
Everard
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
help
you
,
madam
,
"
replied
the
knight
,
"
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
cannot
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
Heaven
,
I
trust
,
will
help
me
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
"
for
I
am
wholly
abandoned
of
man
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
beseech
you
,
madam
<EOS>
,
put
some
constraint
upon
yourself
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
If
,
after
your
arrival
at
Ordsall
,
you
are
still
bent
upon
your
rash
and
fatal
design
,
Father
Garnet
shall
not
oppose
its
execution
.
<EOS>
But
give
yourself
time
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
""Since
it
may
not
be
otherwise
,
I
assent
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
must
go
,
I
will
start
at
once
.
<EOS>
""Wisely
<EOS>
resolved
,
"
replied
Sir
Everard
.
<EOS>
Viviana
then
retired
,
and
soon
afterwards
appeared
equipped
for
her
journey
.
<EOS>
The
two
attendants
and
Nicholas
Owen
were
in
the
court
-
yard
,
and
Catesby
assisted
her
into
the
saddle
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
lose
sight
of
her
,
"
he
said
to
Garnet
,
as
the
latter
mounted
.
<EOS>
"Rest
<EOS>
assured
I
will
not
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
And
taking
the
direction
of
Coventry
,
the
party
rode
off
at
a
brisk
pace
.
<EOS>
Catesby
then
joined
the
other
conspirators
,
while
Sir
Everard
sent
off
Lady
Digby
and
his
household
,
attended
by
a
strong
escort
,
to
Coughton
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
whole
party
repaired
to
the
court
-
yard
,
where
they
called
over
the
muster
-
roll
of
their
men
,
to
ascertain
that
none
were
missing,—examined
their
arms
and
ammunition,—and
finding
all
in
order
,
sprang
to
their
steeds
,
and
putting
themselves
at
the
head
of
the
band
,
rode
towards
Southam
and
Warwick
.

—
<EOS>
HUDDINGTONAbout
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
<EOS>
the
conspirators
reached
Leamington
Priors
,
at
that
time
an
inconsiderable
village
;
and
having
ridden
nearly
twenty
miles
over
heavy
and
miry
roads,—for
a
good
deal
of
rain
had
fallen
in
the
night,—they
<EOS>
stood
in
need
of
some
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
entered
the
first
farm
-
yard
they
came
to
,
and
proceeding
to
the
cow
-
houses
and
sheepfolds
,
turned
out
the
animals
within
them
,
and
fastening
up
their
own
steeds
in
their
places
,
set
before
them
whatever
provender
they
could
find
.
<EOS>
Those
,
and
they
were
by
far
the
greater
number
,
who
could
not
find
better
accommodation
,
fed
their
horses
in
the
yard
,
which
was
strewn
with
trusses
of
hay
and
great
heaps
of
corn
.
<EOS>
The
whole
scene
formed
a
curious
picture
.
<EOS>
Here
was
one
party
driving
away
the
sheep
and
cattle
,
which
were
bleating
and
<EOS>
lowing,—there
,
another
rifling
a
hen
-
roost
,
and
slaughtering
its
cackling
inmates
.
<EOS>
On
this
hand
,
by
the
direction
of
Catesby
,
two
stout
horses
were
being
harnessed
with
ropes
to
a
cart
,
which
he
intended
to
use
as
a
baggage
-
waggon
;
on
that
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
was
interposing
his
authority
to
prevent
the
destruction
of
a
fine
porker
.
<EOS>
Their
horses
fed
,
the
next
care
of
the
conspirators
was
to
obtain
something
for
themselves
:
and
ordering
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
was
terrified
almost
out
of
his
senses
,
to
open
his
doors
,
they
entered
the
dwelling
,
and
causing
a
fire
to
be
lighted
in
the
chief
room
,
began
to
boil
a
large
kettle
of
broth
upon
it
,
and
to
cook
other
provisions
.
<EOS>
Finding
a
good
store
of
eatables
in
the
larder
,
rations
were
served
out
to
the
band
.
<EOS>
Two
casks
of
strong
ale
were
likewise
broached
,
and
their
contents
distributed
;
and
a
small
keg
of
strong
waters
being
also
discovered
,
it
was
disposed
of
in
the
same
way
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
the
extent
of
the
mischief
done
.
<EOS>
All
the
conspirators
,
but
chiefly
Catesby
and
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
dispersed
themselves
amongst
the
band
,
and
checked
any
disposition
to
plunder
.
<EOS>
The
only
articles
taken
away
from
the
house
were
a
couple
of
old
rusty
swords
and
a
caliver
.
<EOS>
Catesby
proposed
to
the
farmer
to
join
their
expedition
.
<EOS>
But
having
now
regained
his
courage
,
the
sturdy
churl
obstinately
refused
to
stir
a
foot
with
them
,
and
even
ventured
to
utter
a
wish
that
the
enterprise
might
fail
.
<EOS>
"I
am
a
good
Protestant
,
and
a
faithful
subject
of
King
James
,
and
will
never
abet
Popery
and
treason
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
This
bold
sally
would
have
been
answered
by
a
bullet
from
one
of
the
troopers
,
if
Catesby
had
not
interfered
.
<EOS>
"You
shall
do
as
you
please
,
friend
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
conciliatory
tone
.
<EOS>
"
We
will
not
compel
any
man
to
act
against
his
conscience
,
and
we
claim
the
same
right
ourselves
.
<EOS>
Will
you
join
us
,
good
fellows
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
,
to
two
farming
men
,
who
were
standing
near
their
master
.
<EOS>
"Must
<EOS>
I
confess
to
a
priest
?
"
asked
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"Certainly
<EOS>
not
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
shall
have
no
constraint
whatever
put
upon
you
.
<EOS>
All
I
require
is
obedience
to
my
commands
in
the
field
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
am
with
you
,
"
replied
the
fellow
.
<EOS>
"Thou'rt
<EOS>
a
traitor
and
rebel
,
Sam
Morrell
,
"
cried
the
other
hind
,
"
and
wilt
come
to
a
traitor
's
end
.
<EOS>
I
will
never
fight
against
King
James
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
must
take
up
arms
,
it
shall
be
against
his
enemies
,
and
in
defence
of
our
religion
.
<EOS>
No
priests,—no
papistry
for
me
.
<EOS>
""Well
said
,
Hugh
,
"
cried
his
master
;
"
we
'll
die
in
that
cause
,
if
need
be
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
turned
angrily
away
,
and
giving
the
word
to
his
men
to
prepare
to
set
forth
,
in
a
few
minutes
all
were
in
the
saddle
;
but
on
inquiring
for
the
new
recruit
,
Sam
Morrell
,
it
was
found
he
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
cart
was
laden
with
arms
,
ammunition
and
a
few
sacks
of
corn
;
and
the
line
being
formed
,
they
commenced
their
march
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
dark
and
misty
,
and
all
looked
dull
and
dispiriting
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
,
however
,
were
full
of
confidence
,
and
their
men
,
exhilarated
and
refreshed
by
their
meal
,
appeared
anxious
for
an
opportunity
of
distinguishing
themselves
.
<EOS>
Arrived
within
half
a
mile
of
Warwick
,
whence
the
lofty
spire
of
the
church
of
Saint
Nicholas
,
the
tower
of
Saint
Mary
's
,
and
the
ancient
gates
of
this
beautiful
old
town
could
just
be
discerned
through
the
mist
,
a
short
consultation
was
held
by
the
rebel
leaders
as
to
the
expediency
of
attacking
the
castle
,
and
carrying
off
the
horses
with
which
they
had
learnt
its
stables
were
filled
.
<EOS>
Deciding
upon
making
the
attempt
,
their
resolution
was
communicated
to
their
followers
,
and
received
with
loud
acclamations
.
<EOS>
Catesby
then
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
band
,
and
they
all
rode
forward
at
a
brisk
pace
.
<EOS>
Crossing
the
bridge
over
the
Avon
,
whence
the
castle
burst
upon
them
in
all
its
grandeur
and
beauty
,
Catesby
dashed
forward
to
an
embattled
gate
commanding
the
approach
to
the
structure
,
and
knocking
furiously
against
it
,
a
wicket
was
opened
by
an
old
porter
,
who
started
back
on
beholding
the
intruders
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
closed
the
wicket
,
but
Catesby
was
too
quick
for
him
,
and
springing
from
his
steed
,
dashed
aside
the
feeble
opposition
of
the
old
man
,
and
unbarred
the
gate
.
<EOS>
Instantly
mounting
again
,
he
galloped
along
<EOS>
a
broad
and
winding
path
cut
so
deeply
in
the
rock
,
that
the
mighty
pile
they
were
approaching
was
completely
hidden
from
view
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
,
however
,
brought
them
to
a
point
,
from
which
its
three
towers
reared
themselves
full
before
them
.
<EOS>
Another
moment
brought
them
to
the
edge
of
the
moat
,
at
this
time
crossed
by
a
stone
bridge
,
but
then
filled
with
water
,
and
defended
by
a
drawbridge
.
<EOS>
As
no
attack
like
the
present
was
apprehended
,
and
as
the
owner
of
the
castle
,
the
celebrated
Fulke
Greville
,
afterwards
Lord
Brooke
,
to
whom
it
had
been
recently
granted
by
the
reigning
monarch
,
was
then
in
the
capital
,
the
drawbridge
was
down
,
and
though
several
retainers
rushed
forth
on
hearing
the
approach
of
so
many
horsemen
,
they
were
too
late
to
raise
it
.
<EOS>
Threatening
these
persons
with
destruction
if
any
resistance
was
offered
,
Catesby
passed
through
the
great
entrance
,
and
rode
into
the
court
,
where
he
drew
up
his
band
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
whole
of
the
inmates
of
the
castle
had
collected
on
the
ramparts
,
armed
with
calivers
and
partisans
,
and
whatever
weapons
they
could
find
,
and
though
their
force
was
utterly
disproportioned
to
that
of
their
opponents
,
they
seemed
disposed
to
give
them
battle
.
<EOS>
Paying
no
attention
to
them
,
Catesby
proceeded
to
the
stables
,
where
he
found
upwards
of
twenty
horses
,
which
he
exchanged
for
the
worst
and
most
jaded
of
his
own
,
and
was
about
to
enter
the
castle
in
search
of
arms
,
when
he
was
startled
by
hearing
the
alarm
-
bell
rung
.
<EOS>
This
was
succeeded
by
the
discharge
of
a
culverin
on
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
named
after
the
redoubted
Guy
,
Earl
of
Warwick
;
and
though
the
bell
was
instantly
silenced
,
Rookwood
,
who
had
dislodged
the
party
from
the
ramparts
,
brought
word
that
the
inhabitants
of
Warwick
were
assembling
,
that
drums
were
beating
at
the
gates
,
and
that
an
attack
might
be
speedily
expected
.
<EOS>
Not
desiring
to
hazard
an
engagement
at
this
juncture
,
Catesby
gave
up
the
idea
of
ransacking
the
castle
,
and
ordered
his
men
to
their
horses
.
<EOS>
Some
delay
,
however
,
occurred
before
they
could
all
be
got
together
,
and
,
meanwhile
,
the
ringing
of
bells
and
other
alarming
sounds
continued
.
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
it
occurred
to
Catesby
to
attempt
to
maintain
possession
of
the
castle
;
but
this
design
was
overruled
by
the
other
conspirators
,
who
represented
to
him
the
impracticability
of
the
design
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
whole
troop
being
assembled
,
they
crossed
the
drawbridge
,
and
speeded
along
the
rocky
path
.
<EOS>
Before
the
outer
gate
they
found
a
large
body
of
men
,
some
on
horseback
,
and
some
on
foot
,
drawn
up
.
<EOS>
These
persons
,
however
,
struck
with
terror
at
their
appearance
,
retreated
,
and
allowed
them
a
free
passage
.
<EOS>
On
turning
to
cross
the
bridge
,
they
found
it
occupied
by
a
strong
and
well
-
armed
body
of
men
,
headed
by
the
Sheriff
of
Warwickshire
,
who
showed
no
disposition
to
give
way
.
<EOS>
While
the
rebel
party
were
preparing
to
force
a
passage
,
a
trumpet
was
sounded
,
and
the
Sheriff
,
riding
towards
them
,
commanded
them
in
the
King
's
name
to
yield
themselves
prisoners
.
<EOS>
"We
do
not
acknowledge
the
supremacy
of
James
Stuart
,
whom
you
call
king
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
We
fight
for
our
liberties
,
and
for
the
restoration
of
the
holy
Catholic
religion
which
we
profess
.
<EOS>
Do
not
oppose
us
,
or
you
will
have
cause
to
rue
your
temerity
.
<EOS>
""Hear
me
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
Sheriff
,
turning
from
him
to
his
men
:
"
<EOS>
I
promise
you
all
a
free
pardon
in
the
King
's
name
,
if
you
will
throw
down
your
arms
,
and
deliver
up
your
leaders
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
after
this
warning
,
you
continue
in
open
rebellion
against
your
sovereign
,
you
will
all
suffer
the
vilest
death
.
<EOS>
""Rejoin
<EOS>
your
men
,
sir
,
"
said
Catesby
,
in
a
significant
tone
,
and
drawing
a
petronel
.
<EOS>
"A
free
pardon
and
a
hundred
pounds
to
him
who
will
bring
me
the
head
of
Robert
Catesby
,
"
said
the
Sheriff
,
disregarding
the
menace
.
<EOS>
"Your
own
is
not
worth
half
the
sum
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
;
and
levelling
the
petronel
,
he
shot
him
dead
.
<EOS>
The
Sheriff
's
fall
was
the
signal
for
a
general
engagement
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
by
the
death
of
their
leader
,
the
royalist
party
assailed
the
rebels
with
the
greatest
fury
,
and
as
the
latter
were
attacked
at
the
same
time
in
the
rear
,
their
situation
began
to
appear
perilous
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
could
withstand
the
vigour
and
determination
of
Catesby
.
<EOS>
Cheering
on
his
men
,
he
soon
cut
a
way
across
the
bridge
,
and
would
have
made
good
his
retreat
,
if
he
had
not
perceived
,
to
his
infinite
dismay
,
that
Percy
and
Rookwood
had
been
captured
.
<EOS>
Regardless
of
any
risk
he
might
run
,
he
shouted
to
those
near
to
follow
him
,
and
made
such
a
desperate
charge
upon
the
royalists
that
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
by
the
side
of
his
friends
,
and
had
liberated
them
.
<EOS>
In
trying
,
however
,
to
follow
up
his
advantage
he
got
separated
from
his
companions
,
and
was
so
hotly
pressed
on
all
sides
,
that
his
destruction
seemed
inevitable
.
<EOS>
His
petronels
had
both
brought
down
their
mark
;
and
in
striking
a
blow
against
a
stalwart
trooper
his
sword
had
shivered
close
to
the
handle
.
<EOS>
In
this
defenceless
state
his
enemies
made
sure
of
him
,
but
they
miscalculated
his
resources
.
<EOS>
He
was
then
close
to
the
side
of
the
bridge
,
and
,
before
his
purpose
could
be
divined
,
struck
spurs
deeply
into
his
horse
,
and
cleared
the
parapet
with
a
single
bound
.
<EOS>
A
shout
of
astonishment
and
admiration
arose
alike
from
friend
and
foe
,
and
there
was
a
general
rush
towards
the
side
of
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
The
noble
animal
that
had
borne
him
out
of
danger
was
seen
swimming
towards
the
bank
,
and
,
though
several
shots
were
fired
at
him
,
he
reached
it
in
safety
.
<EOS>
This
gallant
action
so
raised
Catesby
in
the
estimation
of
his
followers
,
that
they
welcomed
him
with
the
utmost
enthusiasm
,
and
rallying
round
him
,
fought
with
such
vigour
,
that
they
drove
their
opponents
over
the
bridge
and
compelled
them
to
flee
towards
the
town
.
<EOS>
Catesby
now
mustered
his
men
,
and
finding
his
loss
slighter
than
he
expected
,
though
several
were
so
severely
wounded
,
that
he
was
compelled
to
leave
them
behind
,
rode
off
at
a
quick
pace
.
<EOS>
After
proceeding
for
about
four
miles
along
the
Stratford
road
,
they
turned
off
on
the
right
into
a
narrow
lane
leading
to
Snitterfield
,
with
the
intention
of
visiting
Norbrook
,
the
family
residence
of
John
Grant
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
there
,
they
put
the
house
into
a
state
of
defence
,
and
then
assembled
in
the
hall
,
while
their
followers
recruited
themselves
in
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
far
,
well
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
flinging
himself
into
a
chair
;
"
the
first
battle
has
been
won
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Grant
;
"
but
it
will
not
do
to
tarry
here
long
.
<EOS>
This
house
can
not
hold
out
against
a
prolonged
attack
.
<EOS>
""We
will
not
remain
here
more
than
a
couple
of
hours
,
"
replied
Catesby
:
"
but
where
shall
we
go
next
?
<EOS>
I
am
for
making
some
desperate
attempt
,
which
shall
strike
terror
into
our
foes
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
we
strong
enough
to
march
to
the
Earl
of
Harrington
's
mansion
near
Coventry
,
and
carry
off
the
Princess
Elizabeth
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Percy
.
<EOS>
"She
were
indeed
a
glorious
prize
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
I
have
no
doubt
,
on
the
first
alarm
of
our
rising
,
she
has
been
conveyed
to
a
place
of
safety
.
<EOS>
And
even
if
she
were
there
,
we
should
have
the
whole
armed
force
of
Coventry
to
contend
with
.
<EOS>
No
—
<EOS>
no
,
it
will
not
do
to
attempt
that
.
<EOS>
""Nothing
venture
,
nothing
have
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
"
We
ought
,
in
my
opinion
,
to
run
any
risk
to
secure
her
.
""You
know
me
too
well
,
Digby
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
"
to
doubt
my
readiness
to
undertake
any
project
,
however
hazardous
,
which
would
offer
the
remotest
chance
of
success
.
<EOS>
But
in
this
I
see
none
,
unless
,
indeed
,
it
could
be
accomplished
by
stratagem
.
<EOS>
Let
us
first
ascertain
what
support
we
can
obtain
,
and
then
decide
upon
the
measures
to
be
adopted
.
<EOS>
""I
am
content
,
"
returned
Digby
.
<EOS>
"Old
<EOS>
Mr.
Talbot
of
Grafton
is
a
friend
of
yours
,
is
he
not
?
"
<EOS>
continued
Catesby
,
addressing
Thomas
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
Can
you
induce
him
to
join
us?""I
will
try
,
"
replied
Thomas
Winter
;
"
but
I
have
some
misgivings
.
<EOS>
""Be
not
faint
-
hearted
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
and
Stephen
Littleton
shall
go
to
him
at
once
,
and
join
us
at
your
own
mansion
of
Huddington
,
whither
we
will
proceed
as
soon
as
our
men
are
thoroughly
recruited
.
<EOS>
Use
every
argument
you
can
devise
with
Talbot,—tell
him
that
the
welfare
of
the
Catholic
cause
depends
on
our
success,—and
that
neither
his
years
nor
infirmities
can
excuse
his
absence
at
this
juncture
.
<EOS>
If
he
will
not
,
or
can
not
come
himself
,
cause
him
to
write
letters
to
all
his
Catholic
neighbours
,
urging
them
to
join
us
,
and
bid
him
send
all
his
retainers
and
servants
to
us
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
neglect
a
single
plea
,
"
replied
Thomas
Winter
,
"
and
I
will
further
urge
compliance
by
his
long
friendship
towards
myself
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
have
just
said
,
I
despair
of
success
.
<EOS>
"Soon
<EOS>
after
this
,
he
and
Stephen
Littleton
,
with
two
of
the
troopers
well
-
mounted
and
well
-
armed
,
rode
across
the
country
through
lanes
and
by
-
roads
,
with
which
they
were
well
acquainted
,
to
Grafton
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
Catesby
repaired
to
the
court
-
yard
,
and
assembling
his
men
,
found
there
were
twenty
-
five
missing
.
<EOS>
More
than
half
of
these
it
was
known
had
been
killed
or
wounded
at
Warwick
;
but
the
rest
,
it
was
suspected
,
had
deserted
.
<EOS>
Whatever
effect
this
scrutiny
might
secretly
have
upon
Catesby
,
he
maintained
a
cheerful
and
confident
demeanour
,
and
mounting
a
flight
of
steps
,
harangued
the
band
in
energetic
and
exciting
terms
.
<EOS>
Displaying
a
small
image
of
the
virgin
to
them
,
he
assured
them
they
were
under
the
special
protection
of
heaven
,
whose
cause
they
were
fighting
—
and
concluded
by
reciting
a
prayer
,
in
which
the
whole
assemblage
heartily
joined
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
filled
the
baggage
-
cart
with
provisions
and
further
ammunition
,
and
forming
themselves
into
good
order
,
took
the
road
to
Alcester
.
<EOS>
They
had
not
gone
far
,
when
torrents
of
rain
fell
,
and
the
roads
being
in
a
shocking
condition
,
and
ploughed
up
with
ruts
,
they
turned
into
the
fields
wherever
it
was
practicable
,
and
continued
their
march
very
slowly
,
and
under
excessively
disheartening
circumstances
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
ford
across
the
Avon
,
near
Bishopston
,
they
found
the
stream
so
swollen
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
across
it
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
who
made
the
attempt
,
was
nearly
carried
off
by
the
current
.
<EOS>
They
were
therefore
compelled
to
proceed
to
Stratford
,
and
cross
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
"My
friends
,
"
said
Catesby
,
commanding
a
halt
at
a
short
distance
of
the
town
,
"
I
know
not
what
reception
we
may
meet
with
here
.
<EOS>
Probably
much
the
same
as
at
Warwick
.
<EOS>
But
I
command
you
not
to
strike
a
blow
,
except
in
self
-
defence
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
injunctions
given
,
attended
by
the
other
conspirators
,
except
Percy
and
Rookwood
,
who
brought
up
the
rear
,
he
rode
slowly
into
Stratford
,
and
proceeding
to
the
market
-
place
,
ordered
a
trumpet
to
be
sounded
.
<EOS>
On
the
first
appearance
of
the
troop
,
most
of
the
inhabitants
fled
to
their
houses
,
and
fastened
the
doors
,
but
some
few
courageous
persons
followed
them
at
a
wary
distance
.
<EOS>
These
were
harangued
at
some
length
by
Catesby
,
who
called
upon
them
to
join
the
expedition
,
and
held
out
promises
,
which
only
excited
the
derision
of
the
hearers
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
dejected
looks
of
most
of
the
band
,
and
the
drenched
and
muddy
state
of
their
apparel
,
made
them
objects
of
pity
and
contempt
,
rather
than
of
serious
apprehension
:
and
nothing
but
their
numbers
prevented
an
attack
being
made
upon
them
.
<EOS>
Catesby
's
address
concluded
amid
groans
of
dissatisfaction
;
and
finding
he
was
wasting
time
,
and
injuring
his
own
cause
,
he
gave
the
word
to
march
,
and
moved
slowly
through
the
main
street
,
but
not
a
single
recruit
joined
him
.
<EOS>
Another
unpropitious
circumstance
occurred
just
as
they
were
leaving
Stratford
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
of
his
followers
tried
to
slink
away
,
when
Catesby
,
riding
after
them
,
called
to
them
to
return
,
and
no
attention
being
paid
to
his
orders
,
he
shot
the
man
nearest
him
,
and
compelled
the
others
,
by
threats
of
the
same
punishment
,
to
return
to
their
ranks
.
<EOS>
This
occurrence
,
while
it
occasioned
much
discontent
and
ill
-
will
among
the
band
,
gave
great
uneasiness
to
their
leaders
.
<EOS>
Catesby
and
Percy
now
brought
up
the
rear
,
and
kept
a
sharp
look
-
out
to
check
any
further
attempt
at
desertion
.
<EOS>
Digby
and
Winter
,
being
well
acquainted
with
all
the
Catholic
gentry
in
the
neighbourhood
<EOS>
,
they
proceeded
to
their
different
residences
,
and
were
uniformly
coldly
received
,
and
in
some
cases
dismissed
with
reproaches
and
menaces
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
their
efforts
,
too
,
repeated
desertions
took
place
;
and
long
before
they
reached
Alcester
,
their
force
was
diminished
by
a
dozen
men
.
<EOS>
Not
thinking
it
prudent
to
pass
through
the
town
,
they
struck
into
a
lane
on
the
right
,
and
fording
the
Arrow
near
Ragley
,
skirted
that
extensive
park
,
and
crossing
the
hills
near
Weethly
and
Stoney
Moreton
,
arrived
in
about
an
hour
and
a
half
,
in
a
very
jaded
condition
,
at
Huddington
,
the
seat
of
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
Affairs
seemed
to
wear
so
unpromising
an
aspect
,
that
Catesby
,
on
entering
the
house
,
immediately
called
a
council
of
his
friends
,
and
asked
them
what
they
proposed
to
do
.
"For
<EOS>
my
own
part
,
"
he
said
,
"
I
am
resolved
to
fight
it
out
.
<EOS>
I
will
continue
my
march
as
long
as
I
can
get
a
man
to
follow
me
,
and
when
they
are
all
gone
,
will
proceed
alone
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
never
yield
.
<EOS>
""We
will
all
die
together
,
if
need
be
,
"
said
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
rest
here
to
-
night
,
and
in
the
morning
proceed
to
Lord
Windsor
's
mansion
,
Hewel
Grange
,
which
I
know
to
be
well
stocked
with
arms
,
and
,
after
carrying
off
all
we
can
,
we
will
fortify
Stephen
Littleton
's
house
at
Holbeach
,
and
maintain
it
for
a
few
days
against
our
enemies
.
<EOS>
"This
proposal
agreed
to
,
they
repaired
to
the
court
-
yard
,
and
busied
themselves
in
seeing
the
wants
of
their
followers
attended
to
;
and
such
a
change
was
effected
by
good
fare
and
a
few
hours
'
repose
,
that
the
spirits
of
the
whole
party
revived
,
and
confidence
was
once
more
restored
.
<EOS>
A
slight
damp
,
however
,
was
again
thrown
upon
the
satisfaction
of
the
leaders
,
by
the
return
of
Thomas
Winter
and
Stephen
Littleton
from
Grafton
.
<EOS>
Their
mission
had
proved
wholly
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Talbot
had
not
merely
refused
to
join
them
,
but
had
threatened
to
detain
them
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
says
we
deserve
the
worst
of
deaths
,
"
observed
Thomas
Winter
,
in
conclusion
,
"
and
that
we
have
irretrievably
injured
the
Catholic
cause
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
begin
to
fear
he
speaks
the
truth
,
"
rejoined
Christopher
Wright
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
for
us
there
is
no
retreat
.
<EOS>
""None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
choose
between
death
upon
the
battle
-
field
or
on
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
former
be
my
fate
,
"
cried
Percy
.
<EOS>
"And
mine
,
"
added
Catesby
.
<EOS>
An
anxious
and
perturbed
night
was
passed
by
the
conspirators
,
and
many
a
plan
was
proposed
and
abandoned
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
arranged
among
them
that
they
should
each
in
succession
make
the
rounds
of
the
place
,
to
see
that
the
sentinels
were
at
their
posts
—
<EOS>
strict
orders
having
been
given
to
the
latter
to
fire
upon
whomsoever
might
attempt
to
fly
—
but
,
as
Catesby
,
despite
his
great
previous
fatigue
,
was
unable
to
rest
,
he
took
this
duty
chiefly
upon
himself
.
<EOS>
Returning
at
midnight
from
an
examination
of
the
court
-
yard
,
he
was
about
to
enter
the
house
,
when
he
perceived
before
him
a
tall
figure
,
with
a
cloak
muffled
about
its
face
,
standing
in
his
path
.
<EOS>
It
was
perfectly
motionless
,
and
Catesby
,
who
carried
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
threw
the
light
upon
it
,
but
it
neither
moved
forward
,
nor
altered
its
position
.
<EOS>
Catesby
would
have
challenged
it
,
but
an
undefinable
terror
seized
him
,
and
his
tongue
clove
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
An
idea
rose
to
his
mind
that
it
was
the
spirit
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
,
by
a
powerful
effort
,
he
compelled
himself
to
address
it
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
come
to
warn
me
?
<EOS>
"
he
demanded
.
<EOS>
The
figure
moved
in
acquiescence
,
and
withdrawing
the
cloak
,
revealed
features
of
ghastly
paleness
,
but
resembling
those
of
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Have
I
long
to
live
?
"
demanded
Catesby
.
<EOS>
The
figure
shook
its
head
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
I
fall
to
-
morrow
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Catesby
.
<EOS>
The
figure
again
made
a
gesture
in
the
negative
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
next
day?"Solemnly
inclining
its
head
,
the
figure
once
more
muffled
its
ghastly
visage
in
its
cloak
,
and
melted
from
his
view
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
Catesby
remained
in
a
state
almost
of
stupefaction
.
<EOS>
He
then
summoned
up
all
the
resolution
of
his
nature
,
and
instead
of
returning
to
the
house
,
continued
to
pace
to
and
fro
in
the
court
,
and
at
last
walked
forth
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
It
was
profoundly
dark
;
and
he
had
not
advanced
many
steps
when
he
suddenly
encountered
a
man
.
<EOS>
Repressing
the
exclamation
that
rose
to
his
lips
,
he
drew
a
petronel
from
his
belt
,
and
waited
till
the
person
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
you
,
Sir
John
Foliot
?
"
asked
a
voice
,
which
he
instantly
recognised
as
that
of
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"Did
<EOS>
you
manage
to
get
into
the
house
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"I
did
,
"
returned
Catesby
;
"
but
speak
lower
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
sentinel
within
a
few
paces
of
us
.
<EOS>
Come
this
way
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
grasping
the
other
's
arm
he
drew
him
further
down
the
walk
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
think
we
may
venture
to
surprise
them
?
"
demanded
Topcliffe
.
"Hum
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Catesby
,
hesitating
,
in
the
hope
of
inducing
the
other
to
betray
his
design
.
<EOS>
"Or
<EOS>
shall
we
wait
the
arrival
of
Sir
Richard
Walsh
,
the
Sheriff
of
Worcestershire
,
and
the
posse
comitatûs
?
"
<EOS>
pursued
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
soon
do
you
think
the
Sheriff
will
arrive
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Catesby
,
scarcely
able
to
disguise
his
anxiety
.
<EOS>
"He
can
not
be
here
before
daybreak
—
if
so
soon
,
"
returned
Topcliffe
,
"
and
then
we
shall
have
to
besiege
the
house
;
and
though
I
have
no
fear
of
the
result
,
yet
some
of
the
conspirators
may
fall
in
the
skirmish
;
and
my
orders
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
as
I
have
already
apprised
you
,
are
,
to
take
them
alive
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
not
,
for
twice
the
reward
I
shall
receive
for
the
capture
of
the
whole
party
,
that
that
desperate
traitor
,
Catesby
,
should
be
slain
,
"
continued
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
The
plot
was
contrived
by
him
,
and
the
extent
of
its
ramifications
can
alone
be
ascertained
through
him
.
<EOS>
""I
think
I
can
contrive
their
capture
,
"
observed
Catesby
;
"
but
the
utmost
caution
must
be
used
.
<EOS>
I
will
return
to
the
house
,
and
find
out
where
the
chief
conspirators
are
lodged
.
<EOS>
I
will
then
throw
open
the
door
,
and
will
return
to
this
place
,
where
you
can
have
our
men
assembled
.
<EOS>
If
we
can
seize
and
secure
the
leaders
,
the
rest
will
be
easy
.
<EOS>
""You
will
run
great
risk
,
Sir
John
,
"
said
Topcliffe
,
with
affected
concern
.
<EOS>
"Heed
not
that
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
expect
me
in
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Get
together
your
men
as
noiselessly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
"With
this
<EOS>
he
hastily
withdrew
.
<EOS>
On
returning
to
the
house
,
he
instantly
roused
his
companions
,
and
acquainted
them
with
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
object
,
"
he
said
,
"
is
to
make
Topcliffe
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
We
may
obtain
much
useful
information
from
him
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
others
,
if
they
offer
resistance
,
we
will
put
them
to
death
.
<EOS>
""What
force
have
they
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
with
some
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
"It
is
impossible
to
say
precisely
,
"
replied
Catesby
;
"
but
not
more
than
a
handful
of
men
,
I
should
imagine
,
as
they
are
waiting
for
Sir
Richard
Walsh
.
<EOS>
""I
know
not
what
may
be
the
issue
of
this
matter
,
"
observed
Robert
Winter
,
whose
looks
were
unusually
haggard
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
had
a
strange
and
ominous
dream
,
which
fills
me
with
apprehension
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Catesby
,
upon
whose
mind
the
recollection
of
the
apparition
he
had
beheld
rushed
.
<EOS>
"Catesby
,
"
pursued
Robert
Winter
,
taking
him
aside
,
"
if
you
have
any
sin
unrepented
of
,
I
counsel
you
to
make
your
peace
with
Heaven
,
for
I
fear
you
are
not
long
for
this
world
.
<EOS>
""It
may
be
so
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
firmly
;
"
and
I
have
many
dark
and
damning
sins
upon
my
soul
,
but
I
will
die
as
I
have
lived
,
firm
and
unshaken
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
let
us
prepare
for
our
foes
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
proceeded
to
call
up
the
trustiest
of
his
men
,
and
enjoining
profound
silence
upon
them
,
disposed
them
in
various
places
,
that
they
might
instantly
appear
at
his
signal
.
<EOS>
After
giving
them
other
directions
,
he
returned
to
the
garden
,
and
coughed
slightly
.
<EOS>
He
was
answered
by
a
quickly
-
approaching
footstep
,
and
a
voice
demanded,"Are
<EOS>
you
there
<EOS>
,
Sir
John?"Catesby
answered
in
a
low
tone
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
forward
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
there
was
a
rush
of
persons
towards
the
spot
,
and
seizing
Catesby
,
he
cried
,
in
a
triumphant
tone
,
while
he
unmasked
a
lantern
,
and
threw
its
light
full
upon
his
face,"You
are
caught
in
your
own
trap
,
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
You
are
my
prisoner
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
villain
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
disengaging
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
.
<EOS>
Springing
backwards
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
making
the
blade
describe
a
circle
round
his
body
,
effected
his
retreat
in
safety
,
though
a
dozen
shots
were
fired
at
him
.
<EOS>
Leaping
the
garden
wall
,
he
was
instantly
surrounded
by
the
other
conspirators
,
and
the
greater
part
of
the
band
,
who
,
hearing
the
reports
of
the
fire
-
arms
,
had
hurried
to
the
spot
.
<EOS>
Instantly
putting
himself
at
their
head
,
Catesby
returned
to
the
garden
;
but
Topcliffe
and
his
party
had
taken
the
alarm
and
fled
.
<EOS>
Torches
were
brought
,
and
,
by
Catesby
's
directions
,
a
large
heap
of
dry
stubble
was
set
on
fire
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
the
flames
revealed
every
object
for
a
considerable
distance
around
them
,
no
traces
of
the
hostile
party
could
be
discerned
.
<EOS>
After
continuing
their
ineffectual
search
for
some
time
,
the
conspirators
returned
to
the
house
,
and
abandoning
all
idea
of
retiring
to
rest
,
kept
strict
watch
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
Little
conversation
took
place
.
<EOS>
All
were
deeply
depressed
;
and
Catesby
paced
backwards
and
forwards
within
a
passage
leading
from
the
hall
to
the
dining
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
His
thoughts
were
gloomy
enough
,
and
he
retraced
the
whole
of
his
wild
and
turbulent
career
,
pondering
upon
its
close
,
which
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
matters
not
,
"
he
mentally
ejaculated
;
"
I
shall
not
die
ignominiously
,
and
I
would
rather
perish
in
the
vigour
of
manhood
than
linger
out
a
miserable
old
age
.
<EOS>
I
have
striven
hard
to
achieve
a
great
enterprise
,
and
having
failed
,
have
little
else
to
live
for
.
<EOS>
This
band
can
not
hold
together
two
days
longer
.
<EOS>
Our
men
will
desert
us
,
or
turn
upon
us
to
obtain
the
price
set
upon
our
heads
.
<EOS>
And
,
were
they
true
,
I
have
little
reliance
upon
my
companions
.
<EOS>
They
have
no
longer
the
confidence
that
can
alone
insure
success
,
and
I
expect
each
moment
some
one
will
propose
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
Surrender
!
<EOS>
I
will
never
do
so
with
life
.
<EOS>
Something
must
be
done
—
something
worthy
of
me
—
and
then
let
me
perish
.
<EOS>
I
have
ever
prayed
to
die
a
soldier
's
death
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
uttered
these
words
unconsciously
aloud
,
he
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
Robert
Winter
,
who
stood
at
the
end
of
the
passage
,
watching
him
.
<EOS>
"Your
prayer
will
not
be
granted
,
Catesby
,
"
said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
dreadful
doom
,
I
fear
,
is
reserved
for
you
and
all
of
us
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
mean
you
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
other
,
uneasily
.
"Listen
<EOS>
to
me
,
"
replied
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
I
had
a
strange
and
appalling
dream
to
-
night
,
and
I
will
now
relate
it
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
was
in
a
boat
upon
the
river
Thames
,
when
all
at
once
the
day
,
which
had
been
bright
and
smiling
,
became
dark
and
overcast,—not
dark
like
the
shades
of
night
,
but
gloomy
and
ominous
,
as
when
the
sun
is
shrouded
by
an
eclipse
.
<EOS>
I
looked
around
,
and
every
object
was
altered
.
<EOS>
The
tower
of
Saint
Paul
's
stood
awry
,
and
seemed
ready
to
topple
down,—so
did
the
spires
and
towers
of
all
the
surrounding
fanes
.
<EOS>
The
houses
on
London
Bridge
leaned
frightfully
over
the
river
,
and
the
habitations
lining
its
banks
on
either
side
,
seemed
shaken
to
their
foundations
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
some
terrible
earthquake
must
have
occurred
,
or
that
the
end
of
the
world
was
at
hand
.
<EOS>
""Go
on
,
"
said
Catesby
,
who
had
listened
with
profound
attention
to
the
relation
.
<EOS>
"The
stream
,
too
,
changed
its
colour
,
"
continued
Robert
Winter
,
"
and
became
red
as
blood
,
and
the
man
who
rowed
my
boat
was
gone
,
and
his
place
occupied
by
a
figure
masked
and
habited
like
an
executioner
.
<EOS>
I
commanded
him
to
row
me
ashore
,
and
in
an
instant
the
bark
shot
to
land
,
and
I
sprang
out
,
glad
to
be
liberated
from
my
mysterious
conductor
.
<EOS>
My
steps
involuntarily
led
me
toward
the
cathedral
,
and
on
entering
it
,
I
found
its
pillars
,
shrines
,
monuments
,
and
roof
hung
with
black
.
<EOS>
The
throng
that
ever
haunt
Paul
's
Walk
had
disappeared
,
and
a
few
dismal
figures
alone
traversed
the
aisles
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
them
,
I
recognised
in
their
swollen
,
death
-
like
,
and
blackened
lineaments
,
some
resemblance
to
you
and
our
friends
.
<EOS>
I
was
about
to
interrogate
them
,
when
I
was
awakened
by
yourself
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
strange
dream
,
truly
,
"
observed
Catesby
,
musingly
,
"
and
coupled
with
what
I
myself
have
seen
to
-
night
,
would
seem
to
bode
evil
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
then
proceeded
to
describe
the
supernatural
appearance
he
had
beheld
to
his
companion
.
<EOS>
"All
is
over
with
us
,
"
rejoined
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
prepare
to
meet
our
fate
.
<EOS>
""We
must
meet
it
like
men,—like
brave
men
,
Robert
,
"
replied
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
not
disgrace
ourselves
and
our
cause
.
<EOS>
""You
are
right
,
"
rejoined
Robert
Winter
;
"
but
these
visions
are
more
terrible
than
the
contemplation
of
death
itself
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
require
further
rest
,
take
it
,
"
returned
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
In
an
hour
I
shall
call
up
our
men
,
and
march
to
Hewel
Grange
.
<EOS>
""I
am
wearied
enough
,
"
replied
Robert
Winter
,
"
but
<EOS>
I
dare
not
close
my
eyes
again
.
<EOS>
""Then
recommend
your
soul
to
Heaven
,
"
said
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
be
alone
.
<EOS>
Melancholy
thoughts
press
upon
me
,
and
I
desire
to
unburden
my
heart
to
God
.
"Robert
<EOS>
Winter
then
left
him
,
and
he
withdrew
into
a
closet
where
there
was
an
image
of
the
Virgin
,
and
kneeling
before
it
,
prayed
long
and
fervently
.
<EOS>
Arising
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
,
he
returned
to
the
hall
,
and
summoning
his
companions
and
followers
,
their
horses
were
brought
forth
,
and
they
commenced
their
march
.
<EOS>
It
was
about
four
o'clock
when
they
started
,
and
so
dark
,
that
they
had
some
difficulty
in
finding
the
road
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
with
the
utmost
caution
;
but
notwithstanding
this
,
and
though
the
two
Winters
and
Grant
,
who
were
well
acquainted
with
the
country
,
led
the
way
,
many
trifling
delays
and
disasters
occurred
.
<EOS>
Their
baggage
-
cart
frequently
stuck
fast
in
the
deep
ruts
,
while
the
men
missing
their
way
,
got
into
the
trenches
skirting
the
lane
,
and
were
not
unfrequently
thrown
from
their
horses
.
<EOS>
More
than
once
,
too
,
the
alarm
was
given
that
they
were
pursued
,
and
a
sudden
halt
ordered
;
but
these
apprehensions
proved
groundless
,
and
,
after
a
most
fatiguing
ride
,
they
found
themselves
at
Stoke
Prior
,
and
within
two
miles
of
Hewel
Grange
.
<EOS>
Originally
built
in
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
Henry
the
Eighth
,
and
granted
by
that
monarch
to
an
ancestor
of
its
present
possessor
,
Lord
Windsor
,
this
ancient
mansion
was
quadrangular
in
form
,
and
surrounded
by
a
broad
deep
fosse
.
<EOS>
Situated
in
the
heart
of
an
extensive
park
,
at
the
foot
of
a
gentle
hill
,
it
was
now
approached
from
the
brow
of
the
latter
beautiful
eminence
by
the
rebel
party
.
<EOS>
But
at
this
season
,
and
at
this
hour
,
both
park
and
mansion
had
a
forlorn
look
.
<EOS>
The
weather
still
continued
foggy
,
with
drizzling
showers
,
and
though
the
trees
were
not
yet
entirely
stripped
of
their
foliage
,
their
glories
had
altogether
departed
.
<EOS>
The
turf
was
damp
and
plashy
,
and
in
some
places
partook
so
much
of
the
character
of
a
swamp
,
that
the
horsemen
were
obliged
to
alter
their
course
.
<EOS>
But
all
obstacles
were
eventually
overcome
,
and
in
ten
minutes
after
their
entrance
into
the
park
,
they
were
within
gunshot
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
There
were
no
symptoms
of
defence
apparent
,
but
the
drawbridge
being
raised
,
it
was
Catesby
's
opinion
,
notwithstanding
appearances
,
that
their
arrival
was
expected
.
<EOS>
He
was
further
confirmed
in
this
idea
when
,
sounding
a
trumpet
,
and
calling
to
the
porter
to
let
down
the
drawbridge
,
no
answer
was
returned
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
to
the
mansion
was
through
a
lofty
and
machiolated
gateway
,
strengthened
at
each
side
by
an
embattled
turret
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
a
man
at
one
of
the
loopholes
,
Catesby
discharged
his
petronel
at
him
,
and
it
was
evident
from
the
cry
that
followed
that
the
person
was
wounded
.
<EOS>
An
instant
afterwards
calivers
were
thrust
through
the
other
loopholes
,
and
several
shots
fired
upon
the
rebels
,
while
some
dozen
armed
men
appeared
upon
the
summit
of
the
tower
,
and
likewise
commenced
firing
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
Topcliffe
among
the
latter
,
and
enraged
at
the
sight
<EOS>
,
Catesby
discharged
another
petronel
at
him
,
but
without
effect
.
<EOS>
He
then
called
to
some
of
his
men
to
break
down
the
door
of
an
adjoining
barn
,
and
to
place
it
in
the
moat
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
instantly
obeyed
,
and
the
door
afloat
in
the
fosse
,
and
springing
upon
it
,
he
impelled
himself
with
a
pike
towards
the
opposite
bank
.
<EOS>
Several
shots
were
fired
at
him
,
and
though
more
than
one
struck
the
door
,
he
crossed
the
moat
uninjured
.
<EOS>
So
suddenly
was
this
daring
passage
effected
,
that
before
any
of
the
defenders
of
the
mansion
could
prevent
him
,
Catesby
had
severed
the
links
of
the
chain
fastening
the
drawbridge
,
and
it
fell
clattering
down
.
<EOS>
With
a
loud
shout
,
his
companions
then
crossed
it
.
<EOS>
But
they
had
still
a
difficulty
to
encounter
.
<EOS>
The
gates
,
which
were
of
great
strength
,
and
covered
with
plates
of
iron
,
were
barred
.
<EOS>
But
a
ladder
having
been
found
in
the
barn
,
it
was
brought
forward
,
and
Catesby
mounting
it
sword
in
hand
,
drove
back
all
who
opposed
him
,
and
got
upon
the
wall
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
Percy
,
and
several
others
,
and
driving
the
royalists
before
them
,
they
made
their
way
down
a
flight
of
stone
steps
,
and
proceeding
to
the
gateway
,
threw
it
open
,
and
admitted
the
others
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
Committing
the
ransacking
of
the
mansion
to
Digby
and
Percy
,
and
commanding
a
dozen
men
to
follow
him
,
Catesby
entered
a
small
arched
doorway
,
and
ascended
a
winding
stone
staircase
in
search
of
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
His
progress
was
opposed
by
the
soldiers
,
but
beating
aside
all
opposition
,
he
gained
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
,
however
,
was
gone
.
<EOS>
Anticipating
the
result
of
the
attack
,
he
had
let
himself
drop
from
the
summit
of
the
tower
to
the
walls
,
and
descending
by
the
ladder
,
had
made
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
Disarming
the
soldiers
,
Catesby
then
descended
to
the
court
-
yard
,
where
in
a
short
time
a
large
store
of
arms
,
consisting
of
corslets
,
demi
-
lances
,
pikes
,
calivers
,
and
two
falconets
,
were
brought
forth
.
<EOS>
These
,
together
with
a
cask
of
powder
,
were
placed
in
the
baggage
-
waggon
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
larder
and
cellar
had
been
explored
,
and
provisions
of
all
kinds
,
together
with
a
barrel
of
mead
,
and
another
of
strong
ale
,
being
found
,
they
were
distributed
among
the
men
.
<EOS>
While
this
took
place
,
Catesby
searched
the
mansion
,
and
,
partly
by
threats
,
partly
by
persuasion
,
induced
about
twenty
persons
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
This
unlooked
-
for
success
so
encouraged
the
conspirators
,
that
their
drooping
spirits
began
to
revive
.
<EOS>
Catesby
appeared
as
much
elated
as
the
others
,
but
at
heart
he
was
full
of
misgiving
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
the
rebel
party
quitted
Hewel
Grange
,
taking
with
them
every
weapon
they
could
find
.
<EOS>
The
forced
recruits
were
placed
in
the
midst
of
the
band
,
so
that
escape
was
impracticable
.
<EOS>
IV
.
—
HOLBEACHAvoiding
the
high
road
,
and
traversing
an
unfrequented
part
of
the
country
,
the
conspirators
shaped
their
course
towards
Stourbridge
.
<EOS>
As
they
reached
Forfield
Green
,
they
perceived
a
large
party
descending
the
hilly
ground
near
Bromsgrove
,
and
evidently
in
pursuit
of
them
.
<EOS>
An
immediate
halt
was
ordered
,
and
taking
possession
of
a
farm
-
house
,
they
prepared
for
defence
.
<EOS>
Seeing
these
preparations
,
their
pursuers
,
who
proved
to
be
Sir
Richard
Walsh
the
Sheriff
of
Worcestershire
,
Sir
John
Foliot
,
three
gentlemen
named
Ketelbye
,
Salwaye
,
and
Conyers
,
attended
by
a
large
posse
of
men
,
all
tolerably
well
armed
,
drew
up
at
some
distance
from
the
farm
,
and
appeared
to
be
consulting
as
to
the
prudence
of
making
an
attack
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
was
with
them
;
and
Catesby
,
who
reconnoitered
their
proceedings
from
a
window
of
the
dwelling
,
inferred
from
his
gestures
that
he
was
against
the
assault
.
<EOS>
And
so
it
proved
.
<EOS>
The
royalist
party
remained
where
they
were
,
and
as
one
or
two
of
their
number
occasionally
disappeared
,
Catesby
judged
,
and
correctly
,
that
they
were
despatched
for
a
reinforcement
.
<EOS>
Not
willing
to
wait
for
this
,
he
determined
to
continue
his
march
,
and
,
accordingly
,
forming
his
men
into
a
close
line
,
and
bringing
up
the
rear
himself
,
they
again
set
forward
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Walsh
and
his
party
followed
them
,
and
whenever
they
were
in
a
difficult
part
of
the
road
,
harassed
them
with
a
sudden
attack
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
several
stragglers
were
cut
off
,
and
a
few
prisoners
made
.
<EOS>
So
exasperated
did
Catesby
become
by
these
annoyances
,
<EOS>
that
,
though
desirous
to
push
forward
as
fast
as
possible
,
he
halted
at
the
entrance
of
a
common
,
and
prepared
for
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
But
his
purpose
was
defeated
,
for
the
royalist
party
took
another
course
,
nor
did
he
see
anything
more
of
them
for
some
time
.
<EOS>
In
about
an
hour
the
rebels
arrived
at
the
banks
of
the
river
Stour
,
not
far
from
the
little
village
of
Churchill
,
and
here
,
just
as
they
were
preparing
to
ford
the
stream
,
the
sheriff
and
his
followers
again
made
their
appearance
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
also
,
the
forces
of
their
opponents
were
considerably
augmented
,
and
as
more
than
a
third
of
their
own
party
were
engaged
in
crossing
the
stream
,
which
was
greatly
swollen
by
the
recent
rains
,
and
extremely
dangerous
,
their
position
was
one
of
no
slight
peril
.
<EOS>
Nothing
daunted
,
Catesby
instantly
drew
up
his
men
on
the
bank
,
and
,
after
a
short
skirmish
,
drove
away
the
enemy
,
and
afterwards
contrived
to
cross
the
river
without
much
loss
.
<EOS>
He
found
,
however
,
that
the
baggage
-
cart
had
got
immersed
in
the
stream
,
and
it
was
feared
that
the
powder
would
be
damaged
.
<EOS>
They
remained
on
the
opposite
bank
for
some
time
;
but
as
their
enemies
did
not
attempt
to
follow
them
,
they
took
the
way
to
Holbeach
,
a
large
and
strongly
built
mansion
belonging
,
as
has
been
already
stated
,
to
Stephen
Littleton
.
<EOS>
Here
they
arrived
without
further
molestation
,
and
their
first
business
was
to
put
it
into
a
complete
state
of
defence
.
<EOS>
IllustrationAfter
a
long
and
anxious
consultation
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
quitted
them
,
undertaking
to
return
on
the
following
day
with
succours
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Littleton
also
disappeared
on
the
same
evening
.
<EOS>
His
flight
produced
a
strong
impression
on
Catesby
,
and
he
besought
the
others
not
to
abandon
the
good
cause
,
but
to
stand
by
it
,
as
he
himself
meant
to
do
,
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
They
all
earnestly
assured
him
that
they
would
do
so
,
except
Robert
Winter
,
who
sat
apart
,
and
took
no
share
in
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
Catesby
then
examined
the
powder
that
had
been
plunged
in
the
water
in
crossing
the
Stour
,
and
found
it
so
much
wetted
as
to
be
nearly
useless
.
<EOS>
A
sufficient
stock
of
powder
being
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
them
,
he
caused
all
the
contents
of
the
barrel
,
not
dissolved
by
the
immersion
,
to
be
poured
into
a
large
platter
,
and
proceeded
to
dry
it
before
a
fire
which
had
been
kindled
in
the
hall
.
<EOS>
A
bag
of
powder
,
which
had
likewise
been
slightly
wetted
,
was
also
placed
at
what
was
considered
a
safe
distance
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
<EOS>
grant
<EOS>
this
may
prove
more
destructive
to
our
enemies
than
the
combustibles
we
placed
in
the
mine
beneath
the
Parliament
House
!
"
observed
Percy
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
<EOS>
grant
<EOS>
so
,
indeed
!
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
with
a
moody
smile
.
<EOS>
"
They
would
call
it
retribution
,
where
we
to
perish
by
the
same
means
which
we
designed
for
others
.
<EOS>
""Jest
<EOS>
not
on
so
serious
a
matter
,
Catesby
,
"
observed
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
own
part
,
I
dread
the
sight
of
powder
,
and
shall
walk
forth
till
you
have
dried
this
,
and
put
it
away
.
<EOS>
""You
are
not
going
to
leave
us
,
like
Stephen
Littleton
?
"
rejoined
Catesby
,
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"I
will
go
with
him
,
"
said
Christopher
Wright
;
"
so
you
need
be
under
no
apprehension
.
<EOS>
"Accordingly
,
he
quitted
the
hall
with
Robert
Winter
,
and
they
proceeded
to
the
court
-
yard
and
were
conversing
together
on
the
dismal
prospects
of
the
party
,
when
a
tremendous
explosion
took
place
.
<EOS>
The
roof
of
the
building
seemed
rent
in
twain
,
and
amidst
a
shower
of
tiles
,
plaster
,
bricks
,
and
broken
wood
falling
around
,
the
bag
of
powder
dropped
untouched
at
their
feet
.
<EOS>
"Mother
of
mercy
!
"
exclaimed
Christopher
Wright
,
picking
it
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
is
a
providential
occurrence
.
<EOS>
Had
this
exploded
,
we
must
all
have
been
destroyed
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
us
see
what
has
happened
,
"
cried
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
And
,
followed
by
Christopher
Wright
,
he
rushed
towards
the
hall
,
and
bursting
open
the
door
,
beheld
Catesby
enveloped
in
a
cloud
of
smoke
,
and
pressing
his
hand
to
his
face
,
which
was
scorched
and
blackened
by
the
explosion
.
<EOS>
Rookwood
was
stretched
on
the
floor
in
a
state
of
insensibility
,
and
it
at
first
appeared
that
life
was
extinct
.
<EOS>
Percy
was
extinguishing
the
flames
,
which
had
caught
his
dress
,
and
John
Grant
was
similarly
occupied
.
<EOS>
"Those
<EOS>
are
the
very
faces
I
beheld
in
my
dream
,
"
cried
Robert
Winter
,
gazing
at
them
with
affright
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
true
warning
.
"Rushing
<EOS>
up
to
Catesby
,
Christopher
Wright
clasped
him
in
his
arms
,
and
extinguishing
his
flaming
apparel
,
cried
,
"
<EOS>
Wretch
that
I
am
!
<EOS>
that
I
should
live
to
see
this
day!""Be
not
alarmed
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
nothing
—
it
was
a
mere
accident
.
<EOS>
""It
is
no
accident
,
Catesby
,
"
replied
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
Heaven
is
against
us
and
our
design
.
"And
<EOS>
he
quitted
the
room
,
and
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
"I
will
pray
for
forgiveness
!
"
<EOS>
cried
John
Grant
,
whose
vision
was
so
much
injured
by
the
explosion
that
he
could
as
yet
see
nothing
.
<EOS>
And
dragging
himself
before
an
image
of
the
Virgin
,
he
prayed
aloud
,
acknowledging
that
the
act
he
had
designed
was
so
bloody
that
it
called
for
the
vengeance
of
Heaven
,
and
expressing
his
sincere
repentance
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
more
of
this
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
staggering
up
to
him
,
and
snatching
the
image
from
him
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
a
mere
accident
,
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
We
are
all
alive
,
and
shall
yet
succeed
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
inquiry
,
Christopher
Wright
learnt
that
a
blazing
coal
had
shot
out
of
the
fire
,
and
falling
into
the
platter
containing
the
powder
,
had
occasioned
the
disastrous
accident
above
described
.
<EOS>
V.
—
THE
CLOSE
OF
THE
REBELLIONUnable
longer
to
endure
the
agony
occasioned
by
his
scorched
visage
,
Catesby
called
for
a
bucket
of
water
,
and
plunged
his
head
into
it
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
relieved
by
the
immersion
,
he
turned
to
inquire
after
his
fellow
-
sufferers
.
<EOS>
Rookwood
having
been
carried
into
the
open
air
,
had
by
this
time
regained
his
consciousness
;
Percy
was
shockingly
injured
,
his
hair
and
eyebrows
burnt
,
his
skin
blackened
and
swollen
with
unseemly
blisters
,
and
the
sight
of
one
eye
entirely
destroyed
;
while
John
Grant
,
though
a
degree
less
hurt
than
his
companions
,
presented
a
grim
and
ghastly
appearance
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
the
four
sufferers
looked
as
if
they
had
just
escaped
from
some
unearthly
place
of
torment
,
and
were
doomed
henceforth
to
bear
the
brand
of
Divine
wrath
on
their
countenances
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
effect
produced
on
the
others
,
Catesby
rallied
all
his
force
,
and
treating
the
accident
as
a
matter
of
no
moment
,
and
which
ought
not
to
disturb
the
equanimity
of
brave
men
,
called
for
wine
,
and
quaffed
a
full
goblet
.
<EOS>
Injured
as
he
was
,
and
smarting
with
pain
,
Percy
followed
his
example
,
but
both
John
Grant
and
Rookwood
refused
the
cup
.
<EOS>
"Hark
'
e
,
gentlemen
,
"
cried
Catesby
,
fiercely
,
"
you
may
drink
or
not
,
as
you
see
fit
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
have
you
assume
a
deportment
calculated
to
depress
our
followers
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Littleton
and
Robert
Winter
have
basely
deserted
us
.
<EOS>
If
you
have
any
intention
of
following
them
,
go
at
once
.
<EOS>
We
are
better
without
you
than
with
you
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
thought
of
deserting
you
,
Catesby
,
"
rejoined
Rookwood
,
mournfully
;
"
and
when
the
time
arrives
for
action
,
you
will
find
I
shall
not
be
idle
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
now
assured
that
we
have
sold
ourselves
to
perdition
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Catesby
,
with
a
laugh
that
communicated
an
almost
fiendish
expression
to
his
grim
features
;
"
because
a
little
powder
has
accidentally
exploded
and
blackened
our
faces
,
are
we
to
see
in
the
occurrence
the
retributive
justice
of
Heaven
?
<EOS>
Are
we
to
be
cast
down
by
such
a
trifle
?
<EOS>
Be
a
man
,
and
rouse
yourself
.
<EOS>
Recollect
that
the
eyes
of
all
England
are
upon
us
;
and
if
we
must
fall
,
let
us
perish
in
a
manner
that
becomes
us
.
<EOS>
No
real
mischief
has
been
done
.
<EOS>
My
hand
is
as
able
to
wield
a
blade
,
and
my
sight
to
direct
a
shot
,
as
heretofore
.
<EOS>
If
Heaven
had
meant
to
destroy
us
,
the
bag
of
powder
which
has
been
taken
up
in
the
yard
,
and
which
was
sufficient
not
only
to
annihilate
us
,
but
to
lay
this
house
in
ruins
,
would
have
been
suffered
to
explode
.
<EOS>
""Would
it
had
exploded
!
"
exclaimed
John
Wright
.
<EOS>
"
All
would
then
have
been
over
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
,
too
,
fainthearted
,
John
?
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
well
,
leave
me
one
and
all
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
will
fight
it
out
alone
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
wrong
me
by
the
suspicion
,
Catesby
,
"
returned
John
Wright
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
true
to
the
cause
as
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
I
perceive
that
our
last
hour
is
at
hand
,
and
I
would
it
were
past
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
indulgence
of
such
a
wish
at
such
a
moment
is
a
weakness
,
"
rejoined
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
I
care
not
when
death
comes
,
provided
it
comes
gloriously
;
and
such
should
be
your
feeling
.
<EOS>
On
the
manner
in
which
we
meet
our
fate
will
depend
the
effect
which
our
insurrection
will
produce
throughout
the
country
.
<EOS>
We
must
set
a
brave
example
to
our
brethren
.
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praised
;
we
shall
not
perish
on
the
scaffold!""Be
not
too
sure
of
that
,
"
said
Grant
,
gloomily
.
<EOS>
"
It
may
yet
be
our
fate
.
<EOS>
""It
shall
never
be
mine
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
mine
,
"
added
Percy
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
so
far
from
regarding
the
recent
disaster
as
a
punishment
,
though
I
am
the
severest
sufferer
by
it
,
that
I
think
we
ought
to
return
thanks
to
Heaven
for
our
preservation
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
whatever
light
the
accident
is
viewed
,
"
observed
John
Wright
,
"
we
can
not
too
soon
address
ourselves
to
Heaven
.
<EOS>
We
know
not
how
long
it
may
be
in
our
power
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Again
<EOS>
desponding
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
"
<EOS>
But
no
matter
.
<EOS>
You
will
recover
your
spirits
anon
.
<EOS>
"John
<EOS>
Wright
shook
his
head
,
and
Catesby
,
pulling
his
hat
over
his
brows
to
hide
his
features
,
walked
forth
into
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
He
found
,
as
he
expected
,
that
general
consternation
prevailed
amongst
the
band
.
<EOS>
The
men
were
gathered
together
in
little
knots
,
and
,
though
they
became
silent
as
he
approached
,
he
perceived
they
were
discussing
the
necessity
of
a
surrender
.
<EOS>
Nothing
daunted
by
these
unfavourable
,
appearances
,
Catesby
harangued
them
in
such
bold
terms
that
he
soon
inspired
them
with
some
of
his
own
confidence
,
and
completely
resteadied
their
wavering
feelings
.
<EOS>
Elated
with
his
success
,
he
caused
a
cup
of
strong
ale
to
be
given
to
each
man
,
and
proposed
as
a
pledge
,
the
restoration
of
the
Romish
Church
.
<EOS>
He
then
returned
to
the
house
;
and
summoning
the
other
conspirators
to
attend
him
in
a
chamber
on
the
ground
-
floor
,
they
all
prayed
long
and
fervently
,
and
concluded
by
administering
the
sacrament
to
each
other
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
thought
necessary
to
have
the
damage
done
by
the
explosion
repaired
,
and
a
few
hours
were
employed
in
the
operation
.
<EOS>
Evening
was
fast
approaching
,
and
Catesby
,
who
was
anxiously
expecting
the
return
of
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
stationed
himself
on
the
turreted
walls
of
the
mansion
to
look
out
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
came
not
;
and
,
fearing
some
mischance
must
have
befallen
him
,
Catesby
descended
.
<EOS>
Desirous
of
concealing
his
misgivings
from
his
companions
,
he
put
on
a
cheerful
manner
as
he
joined
them
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
surprised
ere
this
that
we
have
not
been
attacked
,
"
remarked
Percy
.
<EOS>
"
Our
enemies
may
be
waiting
for
the
darkness
,
to
take
us
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
they
will
be
disappointed
.
<EOS>
""I
can
only
account
for
the
delay
by
supposing
they
have
encountered
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
and
the
force
he
is
bringing
to
us
,
"
remarked
Christopher
Wright
.
<EOS>
"It
may
be
so
,
"
returned
Catesby
,
"
and
if
so
,
we
shall
soon
learn
the
result
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
spite
of
all
Catesby
's
efforts
he
failed
to
engage
his
companions
in
conversation
,
and
feeling
it
would
best
suit
his
present
frame
of
mind
,
and
contribute
most
to
their
safety
,
to
keep
in
constant
motion
,
he
proceeded
to
the
court
-
yard
,
saw
that
all
the
defences
were
secure
,
that
the
drawbridge
was
raised
,
the
sentinels
at
their
posts
,
and
everything
prepared
for
the
anticipated
attack
.
<EOS>
Every
half
hour
he
thus
made
his
rounds
,
and
when
towards
midnight
he
was
going
forth
,
Percy
said
to
him,"Do
<EOS>
you
not
mean
to
take
any
rest
,
Catesby?""Not
till
I
am
in
my
grave
,
"
was
the
moody
reply
.
<EOS>
Catesby
's
untiring
energy
was
in
fact
a
marvel
to
all
his
followers
.
<EOS>
His
iron
frame
seemed
wholly
unsusceptible
of
fatigue
;
and
even
when
he
returned
to
the
house
,
he
continued
to
pace
to
and
fro
in
the
passage
in
preference
to
lying
down
.
<EOS>
"Rest
<EOS>
tranquilly
,
"
he
said
to
Christopher
Wright
,
who
offered
to
take
his
place
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
rouse
you
on
the
slightest
approach
of
danger
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
though
he
preserved
this
stoical
exterior
,
Catesby
's
breast
was
torn
by
the
keenest
pangs
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
hide
from
himself
that
,
to
serve
his
own
ambitious
purposes
,
he
had
involved
many
loyal
and
worthy
(
till
he
had
deluded
them
)
persons
in
a
treasonable
project
,
which
must
now
terminate
in
their
destruction
;
and
their
blood
,
he
feared
,
would
rest
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
But
what
weighed
heaviest
of
all
upon
his
soul
was
the
probable
fate
of
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"If
I
were
assured
she
would
escape
,
"
he
thought
,
"
I
should
care
little
for
all
the
rest
,
even
for
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
They
say
it
is
never
too
late
to
repent
.
<EOS>
But
my
repentance
shall
lie
between
my
Maker
and
myself
.
<EOS>
Man
shall
never
know
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
night
was
dark
,
and
the
gloom
was
rendered
more
profound
by
a
dense
fog
.
<EOS>
Fearing
an
attack
might
now
be
attempted
,
Catesby
renewed
his
vigilance
.
<EOS>
Marching
round
the
edge
of
the
moat
,
he
listened
to
every
sound
that
might
betray
the
approach
of
a
foe
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
,
nothing
occurred
to
excite
his
suspicions
,
until
about
an
hour
after
midnight
,
as
he
was
standing
at
the
back
of
the
house
,
he
fancied
he
detected
a
stealthy
tread
on
the
other
side
of
the
fosse
,
and
soon
became
convinced
that
a
party
of
men
were
there
.
<EOS>
Determined
to
ascertain
their
movements
before
giving
the
alarm
,
he
held
his
breath
,
and
drawing
a
petronel
,
remained
perfectly
motionless
.
<EOS>
Presently
,
though
he
could
discern
no
object
,
he
distinctly
heard
a
plank
pushed
across
the
moat
,
and
could
distinguish
in
the
whispered
accents
of
one
of
the
party
the
voice
of
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
A
thrill
of
savage
joy
agitated
his
bosom
,
and
he
internally
congratulated
himself
that
revenge
was
in
his
power
.
<EOS>
A
footstep
,
though
so
noiseless
as
to
be
inaudible
to
any
ear
less
acute
than
his
own
,
was
now
heard
crossing
the
plank
,
and
feeling
certain
it
was
Topcliffe
,
Catesby
allowed
him
to
land
,
and
then
suddenly
advancing
,
kicked
the
plank
,
on
which
were
two
other
persons
,
into
the
water
,
and
unmasking
a
dark
lantern
,
threw
its
light
upon
the
face
of
a
man
near
him
,
who
proved
,
as
he
suspected
,
to
be
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
Aware
of
the
advantage
of
making
a
prisoner
of
importance
,
Catesby
controlled
the
impulse
that
prompted
him
to
sacrifice
Topcliffe
to
his
vengeance
,
and
firing
his
petronel
in
the
air
as
a
signal
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
and
sprang
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
attempted
to
defend
himself
,
but
he
was
no
match
for
the
skill
and
impetuosity
of
Catesby
,
and
was
instantly
overpowered
and
thrown
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Percy
and
several
of
the
band
had
come
up
,
and
delivering
Topcliffe
to
the
charge
of
two
of
the
stoutest
of
them
,
Catesby
turned
his
attention
to
the
other
assailants
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
got
across
the
moat
;
but
the
other
,
encumbered
by
his
arms
,
was
floundering
about
,
when
Catesby
pointing
a
petronel
at
his
head
,
he
was
fain
to
surrender
,
and
was
dragged
out
.
<EOS>
A
volley
of
musketry
was
now
fired
by
the
rebels
in
the
supposed
direction
of
their
opponents
,
but
it
could
not
be
ascertained
what
execution
was
done
.
<EOS>
After
waiting
for
some
time
,
in
expectation
of
a
further
attack
,
Catesby
placed
a
guard
upon
the
spot
,
and
proceeded
to
examine
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
thrown
into
a
cellar
beneath
the
kitchen
,
and
the
two
men
were
on
guard
over
him
.
<EOS>
He
refused
to
answer
any
of
Catesby
's
questions
,
though
enforced
by
threats
of
instant
death
.
<EOS>
On
searching
him
some
letters
were
found
upon
him
,
and
thrusting
them
into
his
doublet
,
Catesby
left
him
,
with
the
strictest
injunctions
to
the
men
as
to
his
safe
custody
.
<EOS>
He
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
other
captive
,
and
found
him
somewhat
more
tractable
.
<EOS>
This
man
informed
him
that
Topcliffe
had
intended
to
steal
into
the
house
with
the
design
of
capturing
the
conspirators
,
or
,
failing
in
that
,
of
setting
fire
to
the
premises
.
<EOS>
He
also
ascertained
that
Topcliffe
's
force
consisted
only
of
a
dozen
men
,
so
that
no
further
attack
need
be
apprehended
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
information
,
Catesby
determined
to
be
on
the
safe
side
,
and
doubling
the
sentinels
,
he
stationed
one
of
the
conspirators
,
all
of
whom
had
sprung
to
arms
at
his
signal
,
at
each
of
the
exposed
points
.
<EOS>
He
then
withdrew
to
the
mansion
,
and
examined
Topcliffe
's
papers
.
<EOS>
The
first
despatch
he
opened
was
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
bearing
date
about
the
early
part
of
Fawkes
's
confinement
in
the
Tower
,
in
which
the
Earl
expressed
his
determination
of
wringing
a
full
confession
from
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
A
bitter
smile
curled
Catesby
's
lip
as
he
read
this
,
but
his
brow
darkened
as
he
proceeded
,
and
found
that
a
magnificent
reward
was
offered
for
his
own
arrest
.
<EOS>
"I
must
have
Catesby
captured
,
"
ran
the
missive,—"so
<EOS>
see
you
spare
no
pains
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
rather
all
escaped
than
he
did
.
<EOS>
His
confession
is
of
the
last
importance
in
the
matter
,
and
I
rely
upon
your
bringing
him
to
me
alive
.
<EOS>
""I
will
at
least
balk
him
of
that
satisfaction
,
"
muttered
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
is
this
of
Viviana?"Reading
<EOS>
further
,
he
found
that
the
Earl
had
issued
the
same
orders
respecting
Viviana
,
and
that
she
would
be
rigorously
dealt
with
if
captured
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
"
groaned
Catesby
;
"
I
hope
she
will
escape
these
inhuman
butchers
.
"The
<EOS>
next
despatch
he
opened
was
from
Tresham
,
and
with
a
savage
satisfaction
he
found
that
the
traitor
was
apprehensive
of
double
-
dealing
on
the
part
of
Salisbury
and
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
He
stated
that
he
had
been
put
under
arrest
,
and
was
detained
a
prisoner
in
his
own
house
;
and
fearing
he
should
be
sent
to
the
Tower
,
besought
Topcliffe
to
use
his
influence
with
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
not
to
deal
unfairly
with
him
.
<EOS>
"He
is
rightly
served
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Catesby
,
with
a
bitter
smile
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Heaven
grant
they
may
deal
with
him
as
he
dealt
with
us!"The
consideration
of
these
letters
furnished
Catesby
with
food
for
much
bitter
reflection
.
<EOS>
Pacing
the
room
to
and
fro
with
uncertain
footsteps
,
he
remained
more
than
an
hour
by
himself
,
and
at
last
yielding
to
the
promptings
of
vengeance
,
repaired
to
the
cellar
in
which
he
had
placed
Topcliffe
,
with
the
intention
of
putting
him
to
death
.
<EOS>
What
was
his
rage
and
mortification
to
find
both
the
guard
and
the
prisoner
gone
!
<EOS>
A
door
was
open
,
and
it
was
evident
that
the
fugitives
had
stolen
to
the
moat
,
and
,
swimming
noiselessly
across
it
in
the
darkness
,
had
securely
effected
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
Fearful
of
exciting
the
alarm
of
his
followers
,
Catesby
controlled
his
indignation
,
and
said
nothing
of
the
escape
of
the
prisoner
to
any
but
his
confederates
,
who
entirely
approved
of
the
policy
of
silence
.
<EOS>
They
continued
on
the
alert
during
the
remainder
of
the
night
,
and
no
one
thought
of
seeking
repose
till
it
was
fully
light
,
and
all
danger
of
a
surprise
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Day
dawned
late
and
dismally
.
<EOS>
The
fog
that
had
hung
round
the
mansion
changed
just
before
daybreak
into
drizzling
rain
,
and
this
increased
ere
long
to
heavy
and
drenching
showers
.
<EOS>
Everything
looked
gloomy
and
depressing
,
and
the
conspirators
were
so
disheartened
,
that
they
avoided
each
other
's
regards
.
<EOS>
Catesby
mounted
the
walls
of
the
mansion
to
reconnoitre
.
<EOS>
The
prospect
was
forlorn
and
melancholy
to
the
last
degree
.
<EOS>
The
neighbouring
woods
were
obscured
by
mist
;
the
court
-
yard
and
garden
flooded
with
rain
;
and
the
waters
of
the
moat
spotted
by
the
heavy
shower
.
<EOS>
Not
an
object
was
in
view
,
except
a
hind
driving
cattle
to
a
neighbouring
farm
.
<EOS>
Catesby
shouted
to
him
,
and
the
fellow
with
evident
reluctance
approaching
the
brink
of
the
moat
,
was
asked
whether
he
had
seen
any
troops
in
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
man
answered
in
the
negative
,
but
said
he
had
heard
that
an
engagement
had
taken
place
in
the
night
,
about
five
miles
from
thence
,
near
Hales
Owen
,
between
Sir
Everard
Digby
and
Sir
Richard
Walsh
,
and
that
Sir
Everard
's
party
had
been
utterly
routed
,
and
himself
taken
prisoner
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
was
a
severe
blow
to
Catesby
,
as
it
destroyed
the
last
faint
hope
he
had
clung
to
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
he
continued
wrapt
in
thought
,
and
then
descended
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
large
fire
had
been
kept
up
during
the
night
in
the
hall
,
and
the
greater
part
of
the
band
were
now
gathered
round
it
,
drying
their
wet
clothes
,
and
conversing
together
.
<EOS>
A
plentiful
breakfast
had
been
served
out
to
them
,
so
that
they
were
in
tolerably
good
spirits
,
and
many
of
them
talked
loudly
of
the
feats
they
meant
to
perform
in
case
of
an
attack
.
<EOS>
Catesby
heard
these
boasts
,
but
they
fell
upon
an
idle
ear
.
<EOS>
He
felt
that
all
was
over
;
that
his
last
chance
was
gone
;
and
that
the
struggle
could
not
be
much
longer
protracted
.
<EOS>
Entering
the
inner
room
,
he
sat
down
at
table
with
his
companions
,
but
he
ate
nothing
,
and
continued
silent
and
abstracted
.
<EOS>
"It
is
now
my
turn
to
reproach
you
,
"
observed
Grant
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
deeply
depressed
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
Everard
Digby
is
a
prisoner
,
"
replied
Catesby
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
His
capture
grieves
me
sorely
.
<EOS>
He
should
have
died
with
us
.
<EOS>
"All
echoed
the
wish
.
<EOS>
Catesby
arose
and
closed
the
door
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
attack
will
not
be
many
hours
delayed
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
unless
there
should
be
some
miraculous
interposition
in
our
behalf
,
it
must
end
in
our
defeat
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
us
survive
it
,
"
he
continued
earnestly
.
"
<EOS>
Let
us
swear
to
stand
by
each
other
as
long
as
we
can
,
and
to
die
together
.
<EOS>
""Agreed
!
"
cried
the
others
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
"
continued
Catesby
,
"
I
must
compel
myself
to
take
some
nourishment
,
for
I
have
much
to
do
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
swallowed
a
few
mouthfuls
of
bread
,
and
drained
a
goblet
of
wine
,
he
again
visited
every
part
of
the
habitation
,
<EOS>
examined
the
arms
of
the
men
,
encouraged
them
by
his
looks
and
words
,
and
became
satisfied
,
unless
some
unlooked
-
for
circumstance
occurred
to
damp
their
ardour
,
they
would
offer
a
determined
and
vigorous
resistance
.
<EOS>
"If
I
could
only
come
off
victorious
in
this
last
conflict
,
I
should
die
content
,
"
thought
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
I
do
not
despair
of
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
rain
continued
till
eleven
o'clock
,
when
it
ceased
,
and
the
mist
that
had
attended
it
partially
cleared
off
.
<EOS>
About
noon
,
Catesby
,
who
was
on
the
look
-
out
from
the
walls
of
the
mansion
,
descried
a
large
troop
of
horsemen
issuing
from
the
wood
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
gave
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
bell
was
rung
,
and
all
sprang
to
arms
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
troop
had
advanced
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
house
,
and
Catesby
,
who
had
rushed
into
the
court
-
yard
,
mounted
a
turret
near
the
gate
to
watch
their
movements
,
and
issue
his
commands
.
<EOS>
The
royalists
were
headed
by
Sir
Richard
Walsh
,
who
was
attended
on
the
right
by
Sir
John
Foliot
,
and
on
the
left
by
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
Immediately
behind
them
were
Ketelbye
,
Salwaye
,
Conyers
,
and
others
who
had
accompanied
the
posse
comitatûs
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
A
trumpet
was
then
sounded
,
and
a
proclamation
made
in
a
loud
voice
by
a
trooper
,
commanding
the
rebels
in
the
King
's
name
to
surrender
,
and
to
deliver
up
their
leaders
.
<EOS>
The
man
had
scarcely
concluded
his
speech
when
he
was
for
ever
silenced
by
a
shot
from
Catesby
.
<EOS>
A
loud
and
vindictive
shout
was
raised
by
the
royalists
,
and
the
assault
instantly
commenced
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Walsh
directed
the
attack
against
the
point
opposite
the
drawbridge
,
while
Sir
John
Foliot
,
Topcliffe
,
and
the
others
dispersed
themselves
,
and
completely
surrounded
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Several
planks
were
thrust
across
the
moat
,
and
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
rebels
many
of
the
assailants
effected
a
passage
.
<EOS>
Catesby
drove
back
the
party
under
Sir
Richard
Walsh
,
and
with
his
own
hand
hewed
asunder
their
plank
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
he
so
much
exposed
himself
that
,
but
for
the
injunctions
of
the
Sheriff
,
who
commanded
his
followers
not
to
fire
upon
him
,
he
must
have
been
slain
.
<EOS>
The
other
rebel
-
leaders
displayed
equal
courage
,
and
equal
indifference
to
danger
,
and
though
,
as
has
just
been
stated
,
a
considerable
number
of
the
royalists
had
got
across
the
moat
,
and
entered
the
garden
,
they
had
obtained
no
material
advantage
.
<EOS>
Sir
John
Foliot
and
Topcliffe
commanded
this
party
,
and
encouraged
them
to
press
on
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
continued
and
well
-
directed
firing
was
kept
up
upon
them
from
the
walls
and
windows
of
the
mansion
,
that
they
soon
began
to
show
symptoms
of
wavering
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
and
while
Topcliffe
was
trying
to
keep
his
men
together
,
a
concealed
door
in
the
wall
was
opened
,
and
Catesby
issued
from
it
at
the
head
of
a
dozen
men
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
attacked
Topcliffe
and
his
band
,
put
several
to
the
sword
,
and
drove
those
who
resisted
into
the
moat
.
<EOS>
Foliot
and
Topcliffe
with
difficulty
escaped
across
the
plank
,
which
was
seized
and
pulled
over
to
his
own
side
by
Catesby
.
<EOS>
But
the
hope
which
this
success
inspired
was
instantly
crushed
.
<EOS>
Loud
shouts
were
raised
from
the
opposite
wing
of
the
mansion
,
and
Catesby
to
his
great
dismay
perceived
from
the
volumes
of
smoke
ascending
from
it
that
it
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Uttering
an
exclamation
of
rage
and
despair
,
he
commanded
those
with
him
not
to
quit
their
present
position
,
and
set
off
in
the
direction
of
the
fire
.
<EOS>
He
found
that
an
outbuilding
had
been
set
in
flames
by
a
lighted
brand
thrown
across
the
moat
by
a
trooper
.
<EOS>
The
author
of
the
action
was
named
John
Streete
,
and
was
afterwards
rendered
notorious
by
another
feat
to
be
presently
related
.
<EOS>
Efforts
were
made
to
extinguish
the
conflagration
,
but
such
was
the
confusion
prevailing
that
it
was
found
wholly
impossible
to
do
so
,
and
it
was
feared
that
the
destruction
of
the
whole
mansion
would
ensue
.
<EOS>
Disaster
after
disaster
followed
.
<EOS>
Another
party
had
crossed
the
moat
,
and
burst
into
the
court
-
yard
.
<EOS>
In
the
desperate
conflict
that
ensued
,
Rookwood
was
shot
through
the
arm
,
and
severely
wounded
by
a
pike
,
and
was
borne
into
the
house
by
one
of
his
followers
,
whom
he
entreated
to
kill
him
outright
,
but
his
request
was
refused
.
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
drawbridge
was
lowered
,
and
with
loud
and
exulting
shouts
the
great
body
of
the
royalists
crossed
it
.
<EOS>
Catesby
now
perceived
that
the
day
was
irretrievably
lost
.
<EOS>
Calling
to
Christopher
Wright
,
who
was
standing
near
him
,
to
follow
him
,
and
rushing
towards
the
court
-
yard
,
he
reached
it
just
as
the
royalists
gained
an
entrance
.
<EOS>
In
numbers
both
parties
were
pretty
,
well
matched
,
but
the
rebels
were
now
thoroughly
disheartened
,
and
seeing
how
matters
must
end
,
many
of
them
threw
down
their
arms
,
and
begged
for
mercy
.
<EOS>
A
destructive
fire
,
however
,
was
still
kept
up
on
the
royalists
by
a
few
of
the
rebels
stationed
on
the
walls
of
the
mansion
,
under
the
command
of
John
Wright
.
<EOS>
Putting
himself
at
the
head
of
a
few
faithful
followers
,
Catesby
fought
with
all
the
fury
of
despair
.
<EOS>
Christopher
Wright
was
shot
by
his
side
.
<EOS>
Grant
instantly
sprang
forward
,
but
was
cut
down
by
a
trooper
.
<EOS>
Catesby
was
too
busily
occupied
to
attend
to
the
fate
of
his
companions
,
but
seeing
Thomas
Winter
near
him
,
called
to
him
to
come
on
.
<EOS>
"I
can
fight
no
longer
,
"
said
Thomas
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
My
right
arm
is
disabled
by
a
bolt
from
a
cross
-
bow
.
<EOS>
""Then
die
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
shall
die
—
on
the
scaffold
,
"
rejoined
Topcliffe
,
who
had
heard
the
exclamation
.
<EOS>
And
rushing
up
to
Thomas
Winter
,
he
seized
him
,
and
conveyed
him
to
the
rear
of
his
party
.
<EOS>
Catesby
continued
to
fight
with
such
determined
bravery
that
Sir
Richard
Walsh
,
seeing
it
would
be
vain
to
take
him
alive
,
withdrew
his
restrictions
from
his
men
,
and
ordered
them
to
slay
him
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
most
of
the
rebels
had
thrown
down
their
arms
.
<EOS>
Those
on
the
walls
had
been
dislodged
,
and
John
Wright
,
refusing
to
yield
,
was
slaughtered
.
<EOS>
Catesby
,
however
,
having
been
joined
by
Percy
and
half
a
dozen
men
,
made
a
last
desperate
charge
upon
his
opponents
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
his
sword
shivered
,
and
he
would
have
fallen
back
,
but
found
himself
surrounded
.
<EOS>
Percy
was
close
behind
him
,
and
keeping
together
,
they
fought
back
to
back
.
<EOS>
Even
in
this
disabled
state
,
they
made
a
long
and
desperate
resistance
.
<EOS>
"Remember
<EOS>
your
oath
,
Percy
,
"
cried
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
sworn
not
to
be
taken
to
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
"Illustration"Fear
<EOS>
nothing
,
"
replied
Percy
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
never
quit
this
spot
alive
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
words
were
scarcely
out
of
his
mouth
when
he
fell
to
the
ground
mortally
wounded
,
and
the
same
shot
that
had
pierced
his
breast
had
likewise
stricken
Catesby
.
<EOS>
It
was
fired
by
the
trooper
,
John
Streete
,
who
has
just
been
mentioned
.
<EOS>
Collecting
all
his
force
,
Catesby
struck
a
few
terrible
blows
at
his
opponents
,
and
,
dashing
through
them
,
made
for
the
house
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
reached
the
door
,
which
was
standing
open
,
his
strength
failed
,
and
he
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
In
this
condition
,
he
dragged
himself
into
the
vestibule
,
where
there
was
a
large
wooden
statue
of
the
Virgin
,
and
clasping
his
arms
around
it
pressed
his
lips
to
the
feet
of
the
image
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Streete
,
with
his
drawn
sword
in
one
hand
and
a
petronel
in
the
other
,
prepared
to
finish
his
work
.
<EOS>
But
ere
he
could
reach
him
,
Catesby
had
expired
.
<EOS>
"So
,
"
exclaimed
Topcliffe
,
who
came
up
the
next
moment
,
with
Sir
Richard
Walsh
,
"
we
have
been
robbed
of
our
prey
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Salisbury
will
never
forgive
me
for
this
disappointment
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
I
have
done
it
,
though
,
"
observed
Streete
.
"
<EOS>
To
kill
two
such
traitors
with
one
shot
is
something
to
talk
of
.
<EOS>
""You
will
be
well
rewarded
for
it
,
no
doubt
,
"
remarked
Topcliffe
,
sarcastically
.
<EOS>
"I
care
not
whether
I
am
or
not
,
"
rejoined
Streete
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
done
my
duty
,
and
besides
I
have
avenged
my
comrade
,
Richard
Trueman
,
who
was
shot
by
this
traitor
when
he
read
the
proclamation
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
care
that
your
brave
action
is
duly
represented
to
his
Majesty
,
"
observed
Sir
Richard
Walsh
.
<EOS>
And
he
failed
not
to
keep
his
promise
.
<EOS>
Streete
received
a
pension
of
two
shillings
a
day
for
the
rest
of
his
life
—
no
inconsiderable
sum
in
those
days
.
<EOS>
The
conflict
was
now
at
an
end
,
for
though
some
few
of
the
more
desperate
of
the
rebels
continued
to
struggle
after
their
leaders
had
fallen
,
they
were
soon
disarmed
.
<EOS>
Sir
Richard
Walsh
and
Topcliffe
went
in
search
of
the
other
conspirators
,
and
finding
Rookwood
and
Grant
,
who
though
severely
wounded
were
not
dead
,
lying
in
the
hall
,
immediately
secured
them
.
<EOS>
Rookwood
on
their
approach
made
an
effort
to
plunge
his
dagger
into
his
breast
,
but
his
hand
was
stayed
by
Sir
Richard
Walsh
.
"We
<EOS>
shall
not
go
away
quite
empty
-
handed
,
"
cried
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
But
these
are
sorry
substitutes
for
Catesby
.
<EOS>
"Has
<EOS>
Catesby
escaped
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Grant
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
to
the
other
world
,
"
replied
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
kept
his
word
,
"
groaned
Grant
.
<EOS>
"He
may
have
escaped
some
part
of
his
punishment
,
"
said
Topcliffe
,
bitterly
;
"
but
the
worst
remains
.
<EOS>
His
quarters
will
be
exposed
on
every
gate
in
London
,
and
his
head
on
the
bridge
.
<EOS>
As
to
you
,
traitors
,
you
know
your
doom
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
are
prepared
for
it
,
"
rejoined
Grant
.
<EOS>
A
guard
being
left
over
the
prisoners
,
Sir
Richard
Walsh
and
Topcliffe
then
went
to
see
that
the
other
captives
were
properly
secured
.
<EOS>
Some
few
having
made
their
escape
into
the
adjoining
fields
,
they
were
pursued
and
recaptured
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
prisoners
were
then
conveyed
to
Stourbridge
,
where
they
were
lodged
in
the
gaol
,
after
which
Sir
Richard
Walsh
despatched
a
messenger
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
the
Lords
of
the
Council
acquainting
them
with
what
he
had
done
.

—
<EOS>
HAGLEYRobert
Winter
,
it
may
be
remembered
,
immediately
after
the
explosion
,
quitted
Holbeach
,
and
did
not
return
to
it
.
<EOS>
He
proceeded
to
the
neighbouring
thicket
,
and
while
wandering
about
in
a
state
bordering
on
distraction
encountered
Stephen
Littleton
,
who
had
likewise
deserted
his
companions
on
the
same
day
.
<EOS>
Acquainting
him
with
the
disastrous
occurrence
that
had
taken
place
,
and
stating
his
impression
that
both
God
and
man
were
against
them
,
and
that
it
would
be
vain
as
well
as
impious
to
struggle
longer
,
he
proposed
to
him
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
But
Stephen
Littleton
so
strongly
combated
this
opinion
,
that
he
at
last
consented
to
make
an
effort
to
escape
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
no
easy
matter
,
nor
could
they
devise
a
plan
that
appeared
feasible
.
<EOS>
Both
were
well
provided
with
money
;
but
under
present
circumstances
it
would
be
of
little
use
to
them
.
<EOS>
A
large
price
being
set
on
their
heads
,
and
the
whole
country
alarmed
,
they
scarcely
knew
where
to
seek
shelter
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
debate
,
they
quitted
the
covert
,
and
keeping
clear
of
all
habitations
,
took
the
direction
of
Stourbridge
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
the
Stour
,
at
a
point
opposite
Churchill
,
where
they
knew
the
river
was
fordable
,
they
perceived
Sir
Richard
Walsh
's
force
approaching
,
and
threw
themselves
into
a
ditch
to
avoid
observation
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
dark
when
they
again
ventured
forth
,
and
at
the
peril
of
their
lives
they
forded
the
Stour
,
which
was
swollen
more
than
it
had
been
in
the
morning
by
the
long
-
continued
rain
.
<EOS>
Their
design
was
to
proceed
to
Hagley
,
the
residence
of
Stephen
Littleton
's
sister
,
Mrs.
Littleton
,
and
to
claim
her
protection
.
<EOS>
This
magnificent
mansion
lay
about
two
miles
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
in
the
heart
of
an
extensive
park
,
but
they
were
obliged
to
take
a
circuitous
route
of
nearly
double
the
distance
to
reach
it
,
and
when
at
length
they
arrived
there
,
and
were
about
to
steal
into
the
court
-
yard
;
they
found
it
occupied
by
a
portion
of
Sir
Richard
Walsh
's
troop
.
<EOS>
Overcome
by
anxiety
and
fatigue
,
and
scarcely
knowing
whither
to
proceed
,
they
recrossed
the
park
,
and
sought
out
the
cottage
of
a
poor
woman
,
whose
two
sons
had
joined
their
ill
-
fated
expedition
,
and
were
at
that
moment
under
arms
at
Holbeach
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
good
Catholic
,
and
they
thought
they
might
confide
in
her
.
<EOS>
Arriving
at
her
cottage
,
they
glanced
in
at
the
window
,
and
perceiving
her
,
as
they
concluded
,
alone
,
and
cooking
a
small
piece
of
meat
at
the
fire
,
they
raised
the
latch
,
and
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
woman
turned
at
their
approach
,
and
uttering
a
cry
of
surprise
and
alarm
,
pointed
towards
a
back
room
.
<EOS>
They
then
saw
that
they
had
betrayed
themselves
;
but
the
caution
came
too
late
,
and
a
stalwart
trooper
,
alarmed
by
the
cry
,
issued
from
the
back
room
.
<EOS>
From
the
wretched
appearance
of
the
new
-
comers
,
he
at
once
guessed
that
they
were
rebels
,
and
felt
satisfied
,
from
the
richness
of
their
apparel
,
dirtied
and
stained
as
it
was
,
that
they
were
persons
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
drew
a
brace
of
petronels
,
and
holding
them
at
their
heads
,
commanded
them
to
surrender
.
<EOS>
They
were
too
much
taken
by
surprise
,
and
too
enfeebled
to
offer
resistance
,
and
the
trooper
calling
to
the
old
woman
to
bring
a
cord
to
bind
them
,
at
the
same
time
unloosed
his
own
girdle
,
with
which
he
fastened
Robert
Winter
's
arms
behind
his
back
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
he
was
compelled
to
lay
down
his
petronels
,
and
he
had
scarcely
done
so
,
when
the
woman
snatched
them
up
,
and
gave
them
to
Stephen
Littleton
,
who
presented
them
at
his
head
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
the
turn
of
the
conspirators
to
triumph
.
<EOS>
In
another
instant
,
Robert
Winter
was
released
by
the
old
woman
,
and
the
pair
throwing
themselves
upon
the
trooper
,
forced
him
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
They
then
dragged
him
to
the
back
room
,
and
stripped
him
of
his
habiliments
,
which
Stephen
Littleton
put
on
instead
of
his
own
attire
,
and
binding
him
hand
and
foot
,
returned
to
the
old
woman
.
<EOS>
At
the
request
of
Robert
Winter
,
she
furnished
him
with
a
suit
of
clothes
belonging
to
one
of
her
sons
,
and
then
set
before
them
the
best
eatables
she
possessed
.
<EOS>
They
were
ravenously
hungry
,
and
soon
disposed
of
the
viands
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
their
hostess
told
them
that
the
whole
country
was
in
arms
against
them
;
that
Mrs.
Littleton
being
suspected
,
though
she
had
always
been
adverse
to
the
design
,
her
house
had
undergone
a
rigorous
search
;
but
that
Mr.
Humphrey
Littleton
,
not
having
taken
any
part
in
the
insurrection
,
had
not
as
yet
been
arrested
,
though
it
was
feared
he
would
be
proved
to
be
connected
with
the
plot
.
<EOS>
She
concluded
by
strongly
counselling
them
to
use
the
utmost
caution
,
and
to
expose
themselves
as
little
as
possible
.
<EOS>
They
assured
her
she
need
have
no
apprehension
on
that
score
,
and
expressed
great
anxiety
as
to
what
would
befal
her
when
they
were
pone
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
desire
to
shed
blood
,
if
it
can
be
helped
,
"
said
Stephen
Littleton
;
"
but
in
a
case
of
necessity
,
like
the
present
,
where
life
must
be
weighed
against
life
,
I
hold
it
lawful
to
shed
it
.
<EOS>
Shall
we
put
the
trooper
to
death?""Not
unless
your
own
safety
requires
it
,
good
sirs
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
quit
this
cottage
soon
after
you
have
left
it
,
and
obtain
a
safe
asylum
with
one
of
my
neighbours
.
<EOS>
It
matters
not
what
becomes
of
me
.
<EOS>
Having
lost
my
two
sons,—for
I
consider
them
as
already
dead,—I
have
nothing
left
to
bind
me
to
life
.
<EOS>
"Unable
<EOS>
to
make
any
reply
,
the
conspirators
remained
for
some
time
silent
,
when
,
by
the
poor
woman
's
advice
,
they
withdrew
to
an
upper
chamber
,
and
stretching
themselves
on
a
bed
,
sought
a
few
hours
'
repose
.
<EOS>
The
old
woman
kept
watch
below
,
and
they
gave
her
one
of
the
petronels
,
with
strict
injunctions
to
blow
out
the
trooper
's
brains
if
he
attempted
to
move
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
occurred
to
alarm
her
,
and
at
three
o'clock
she
awakened
them
.
<EOS>
Offering
the
woman
a
handsome
reward
,
which
,
however
,
she
declined
,
they
then
set
out
;
and
shortly
afterwards
their
hostess
quitted
her
habitation
,
and
withdrew
to
the
cottage
of
a
neighbour
,
where
she
remained
concealed
for
some
weeks
,
and
then
died
of
grief
on
learning
that
her
sons
had
been
slain
during
the
assault
of
Holbeach
by
the
royalists
.
<EOS>
Recruited
by
the
rest
they
had
enjoyed
,
the
conspirators
pursued
their
course
over
the
fields
.
<EOS>
The
weather
was
the
same
as
that
which
disheartened
their
confederates
at
Holbeach
,
and
the
rain
fell
so
heavily
that
they
had
soon
not
a
dry
thread
upon
them
.
<EOS>
But
being
now
disguised
,
they
were
not
under
so
much
apprehension
of
detection
.
<EOS>
Shaping
their
course
towards
Rowley
Regis
,
in
Staffordshire
,
which
lay
about
five
miles
from
Hagley
,
where
a
farmer
named
Pelborrow
,
a
tenant
of
Humphrey
Littleton
,
resided
,
and
whom
they
thought
would
befriend
them
,
they
proceeded
swiftly
on
their
way
;
but
,
though
well
acquainted
with
the
country
,
they
were
so
bewildered
and
deceived
by
the
fog
,
that
they
strayed
materially
out
of
their
course
,
and
when
it
grew
light
found
themselves
near
Weoley
Castle
,
and
about
four
miles
from
Birmingham
.
<EOS>
Confiding
in
their
disguises
,
and
in
their
power
of
sustaining
the
characters
they
assumed
,
they
got
into
the
high
road
,
and
approaching
a
farm
-
house
,
Stephen
Littleton
,
who
had
tied
his
companion
's
arms
behind
him
with
his
belt
,
represented
himself
as
a
trooper
conveying
a
prisoner
from
Stourbridge
to
Birmingham
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
obtained
a
breakfast
from
the
farmer
.
<EOS>
After
their
meal
was
over
,
the
host
,
who
had
eyed
them
suspiciously
,
observed
to
the
supposed
trooper,—"You
will
overtake
some
of
your
comrades
before
you
reach
Egbaston
,
and
had
better
lose
no
time
in
joining
them
.
<EOS>
You
are
known
to
me
,
my
masters
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
tone
that
could
not
be
heard
by
the
household
;
"
but
I
will
not
betray
you
.
<EOS>
Get
you
gone
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
conspirators
did
not
fail
to
act
upon
the
suggestion
,
and
as
soon
as
they
got
out
of
sight
,
struck
across
the
county
in
the
direction
of
Rowley
Regis
,
and
arrived
at
the
farm
-
house
which
was
their
destination
in
about
an
hour
.
<EOS>
Pelborrow
chanced
to
be
in
a
barn
adjoining
his
house
,
and
alone
,
and
on
seeing
them
readily
offered
to
hide
them
.
<EOS>
No
one
had
noticed
their
approach
,
and
carefully
concealing
them
amid
the
hay
in
the
loft
,
he
proceeded
about
his
business
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
just
then
procure
them
provisions
without
exciting
suspicion
;
but
when
night
arrived
brought
them
a
sufficient
supply
for
the
next
day
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
they
passed
nearly
a
week
,
never
venturing
to
stir
forth
,
for
they
had
been
traced
to
the
neighbourhood
,
and
constant
search
was
going
on
after
them
.
<EOS>
Pelborrow
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
his
men
out
of
the
barn
,
and
the
disappearance
of
the
provisions
excited
the
suspicions
of
his
female
domestics
,
who
began
to
think
all
was
not
right
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
intimated
to
the
conspirators
that
they
must
change
their
quarters
,
and
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
they
removed
to
the
house
of
another
farmer
named
Perkes
,
residing
on
the
borders
of
Hagley
Park
,
to
whom
Pelborrow
had
confided
the
secret
of
their
being
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
who
,
on
promise
of
a
large
reward
,
readily
undertook
to
secrete
them
.
<EOS>
Perkes
met
them
at
a
little
distance
from
his
house
,
and
conducted
them
to
a
barley
-
mow
,
where
he
had
contrived
a
hiding
-
place
amid
the
straw
for
them
.
<EOS>
A
woman
-
servant
and
a
man
were
both
let
into
the
secret
by
Perkes
,
and
a
sum
of
money
,
given
him
for
that
purpose
by
the
conspirators
,
bribed
them
to
silence
.
<EOS>
Here
they
remained
close
prisoners
,
unable
to
stir
forth
,
or
even
to
change
their
habiliments
for
nearly
six
weeks
,
during
which
time
they
received
constant
intelligence
from
their
protector
of
what
was
going
forward
,
and
learnt
that
the
search
for
them
had
not
relaxed
.
<EOS>
They
were
not
without
hope
,
however
,
that
the
worst
was
over
,
when
an
incident
occurred
that
gave
them
serious
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
Perkes
,
who
was
a
stout
,
hale
yeoman
,
and
had
formerly
been
warrener
to
Mrs.
Littleton
,
went
to
catch
conies
,
with
a
companion
named
Poynter
,
and
returned
laden
with
spoil
.
<EOS>
After
drinking
a
cup
or
two
of
ale
together
,
the
pair
separated
,
and
Poynter
feeling
fatigued
with
his
exertions
,
as
well
as
drowsy
with
the
liquor
he
had
swallowed
,
determined
to
pass
the
night
in
his
friend
's
barn
,
and
entering
it
,
clambered
up
to
the
loft
,
and
laid
himself
in
the
straw
.
<EOS>
In
doing
this
,
he
slipped
into
the
hole
made
for
the
conspirators
,
who
,
aroused
by
his
fall
,
instantly
seized
him
.
<EOS>
Terrified
to
death
,
and
fancying
he
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
gipsies
or
other
plunderers
,
Poynter
roared
for
mercy
,
which
they
were
not
at
first
disposed
to
show
him
;
but
the
poor
wretch
,
finding
into
whose
hands
he
had
fallen
,
besought
them
in
such
piteous
terms
to
spare
his
life
,
affirming
with
the
strongest
oaths
that
he
would
never
betray
them
,
that
they
consented
to
spare
him
,
on
condition
of
his
remaining
with
them
as
long
as
they
should
occupy
their
place
of
concealment
.
<EOS>
When
Perkes
appeared
in
the
morning
,
he
was
not
a
little
surprised
at
finding
his
comrade
caught
in
such
a
trap
,
but
entirely
approved
of
the
course
taken
by
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
Poynter
,
as
may
be
supposed
,
was
no
willing
captive
;
and
being
constantly
pondering
on
the
means
of
escape
,
and
of
obtaining
the
reward
for
the
apprehension
of
the
conspirators
,
at
last
hit
upon
the
following
expedient
.
<EOS>
While
engaged
in
the
poaching
expedition
with
Perkes
,
he
had
received
a
slight
wound
in
the
leg
,
and
the
close
confinement
to
which
he
was
now
subjected
inflamed
it
to
such
a
degree
as
to
render
it
highly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
This
he
represented
to
the
conspirators
,
who
,
however
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
depart
;
but
desired
Perkes
to
bring
him
some
ointment
to
dress
his
wound
.
<EOS>
The
request
was
complied
with
,
and
feigning
that
it
was
necessary
to
approach
the
light
to
apply
the
salve
,
Poynter
scrambled
up
the
straw
,
apparently
for
that
sole
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
attempt
to
fly
for
several
days
;
but
at
last
,
when
they
were
grown
less
suspicious
,
he
slided
down
the
other
side
of
the
loft
,
and
made
good
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
saw
the
error
they
had
committed
when
too
late
.
<EOS>
Not
daring
to
pursue
him
,
they
remained
in
fearful
anticipation
of
an
arrest
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
But
they
were
not
disturbed
until
night
,
when
Perkes
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
They
told
him
what
had
happened
;
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
much
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
think
you
need
be
afraid
of
him
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
have
some
money
,
and
I
will
go
in
quest
of
him
at
once
,
and
bribe
him
to
silence
.
<EOS>
""Here
are
fifty
marks
,
"
replied
Stephen
Littleton
.
<EOS>
"
If
that
is
not
enough
,
take
more
.
<EOS>
""It
will
amply
suffice
,
"
replied
Perkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
answer
for
his
silence
.
<EOS>
"This
assurance
greatly
relieved
the
conspirators
,
and
they
were
made
completely
easy
by
the
return
of
Perkes
in
less
than
an
hour
afterwards
,
who
told
them
he
had
seen
Poynter
,
and
had
given
him
the
money
,
binding
him
by
the
most
solemn
oaths
not
to
betray
them
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
still
better
news
for
you
,
my
masters
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
Mrs.
Littleton
has
set
out
for
London
to
-
day
;
and
I
have
received
orders
from
Mr.
Humphrey
Littleton
to
bring
you
to
the
hall
at
midnight
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
last
intelligence
completed
their
satisfaction
,
and
they
awaited
Perkes
's
return
with
impatience
.
<EOS>
Shortly
before
midnight
,
he
came
to
summon
them
,
and
they
set
forth
together
.
<EOS>
Perkes
's
house
lay
about
a
mile
from
the
hall
,
and
they
soon
entered
the
park
.
<EOS>
The
night
was
clear
and
frosty,—it
was
now
the
middle
of
December,—and
as
the
conspirators
trod
the
crisp
sod
,
and
gazed
at
the
noble
but
leafless
trees
around
them
,
they
silently
returned
thanks
to
Heaven
for
their
restoration
to
freedom
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Littleton
was
waiting
for
them
at
the
end
of
an
avenue
near
the
mansion
,
and
tenderly
embraced
them
.
<EOS>
Tears
of
joy
were
shed
on
both
sides
,
and
it
seemed
to
Humphrey
Littleton
as
if
his
brother
had
been
restored
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Dismissing
Perkes
with
warm
thanks
,
and
promises
of
a
further
recompence
,
they
then
entered
the
house
by
a
window
,
which
had
been
left
purposely
open
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Littleton
conducted
them
to
his
own
chamber
,
where
fresh
apparel
was
provided
for
them
;
and
to
poor
wretches
who
had
not
been
able
to
put
off
their
attire
for
so
long
a
period
,
the
luxury
of
the
change
was
indescribably
great
.
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
the
fugitives
was
kept
secret
from
all
the
household
except
the
man
-
cook
,
John
Ocklie
,
upon
whose
fidelity
Humphrey
Littleton
thought
he
could
rely
.
<EOS>
A
good
supper
was
prepared
by
this
man
,
and
brought
up
into
his
master
's
chamber
,
where
the
conspirators
were
now
seated
before
a
hearth
heaped
with
blazing
logs
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
needed
no
solicitation
to
fall
to
,
and
they
did
ample
justice
to
the
good
things
before
them
.
<EOS>
His
spirits
being
raised
by
the
good
cheer
,
Robert
Winter
observed
to
the
cook
,
who
was
in
attendance
upon
them,"Ah
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
thy
mistress
little
thinks
what
guests
are
now
in
her
house
,
who
have
neither
seen
fire
nor
tasted
a
hot
morsel
for
well
-
nigh
two
months
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
it
is
a
sad
matter
,
"
returned
the
cook
,
shaking
his
head
,
"
and
I
wish
I
could
offer
your
worships
a
flask
of
wine
,
or
a
cup
of
stout
ale
at
the
least
.
<EOS>
But
the
butler
is
in
bed
,
and
if
I
were
to
rouse
him
at
this
hour
it
might
excite
his
suspicion
.
<EOS>
If
you
are
willing
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
to
Humphrey
Littleton
,
"
I
will
hie
to
my
mother
's
cottage
in
the
park
,
and
bring
a
jug
of
ale
from
her
.
<EOS>
"This
was
agreed
to
,
and
the
cook
left
the
house
.
<EOS>
His
sole
object
,
however
,
was
to
instruct
his
mother
to
give
the
alarm
,
so
that
the
conspirators
might
be
arrested
before
morning
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
her
cottage
,
he
was
surprised
to
see
a
light
within
it
,
and
two
men
there
,
one
of
whom
was
Poynter
,
and
the
other
Mrs.
Littleton
's
steward
,
Robert
Hazlewood
.
<EOS>
Poynter
had
acquainted
Hazlewood
with
all
he
knew
respecting
the
conspirators
,
supposing
them
still
in
the
barley
-
mow
,
and
they
were
discussing
the
best
means
of
arresting
them
,
when
the
cook
entered
the
house
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
birds
are
flown
,
"
he
said
,
"
as
you
will
find
,
if
you
search
the
nest
.
<EOS>
But
come
to
the
hall
with
a
sufficient
force
betimes
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
I
will
show
you
where
to
find
them
.
<EOS>
I
shall
claim
,
however
,
my
share
of
the
reward
,
though
I
must
not
appear
in
the
matter
.
"Having
<EOS>
fully
arranged
their
plan
,
he
procured
the
ale
from
his
mother
,
and
returned
to
the
hall
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
soon
disposed
of
the
jug
,
threw
themselves
on
a
couch
in
the
room
,
and
instantly
dropping
asleep
,
enjoyed
such
repose
as
only
falls
to
the
lot
of
those
who
have
similarly
suffered
.
<EOS>
And
it
was
well
they
did
sleep
soundly
,
for
it
was
the
last
tranquil
night
<EOS>
they
ever
enjoyed!Humphrey
Littleton
,
who
,
as
has
been
stated
,
reposed
implicit
confidence
in
the
cook
,
had
committed
the
key
of
the
chamber
to
him
,
strictly
enjoining
him
to
call
them
in
the
morning
;
and
the
fellow
,
feeling
secure
of
his
prey
,
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
About
seven
o'clock
,
he
burst
suddenly
into
the
room
,
and
with
a
countenance
of
well
-
feigned
alarm
,
which
struck
tenor
into
the
breasts
of
the
conspirators
,
<EOS>
cried—"Master
Hazlewood
and
the
officers
are
below
,
and
say
they
must
search
the
house
.
<EOS>
Poynter
is
with
them
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
villain
has
betrayed
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Stephen
Littleton
.
<EOS>
"
Fools
that
we
were
to
spare
his
life!""There
is
no
use
in
lamenting
your
indiscretion
now
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
cook
;
"
leave
it
to
me
,
and
I
will
yet
effect
your
escape
.
<EOS>
""We
<EOS>
place
ourselves
entirely
in
your
hands
,
"
said
Stephen
Littleton
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
down
stairs
,
sir
,
"
said
the
cook
to
Humphrey
Littleton
,
"
and
hold
Master
Hazlewood
in
conversation
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
I
will
engage
to
get
the
gentlemen
safely
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"Humphrey
<EOS>
Littleton
obeyed
,
and
descending
to
the
steward
,
told
him
he
was
willing
to
conduct
him
to
every
room
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
"I
am
certain
they
are
here
,
and
shall
not
quit
it
till
I
find
them
,
"
rejoined
Hazlewood
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
,
"
you
say
they
are
not
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
they
are
in
the
garden
—
in
the
summer
-
house
?
<EOS>
We
will
go
and
see
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
took
half
-
a
-
dozen
of
his
men
with
him
,
leaving
Poynter
and
the
rest
with
Humphrey
Littleton
,
who
was
perplexed
and
alarmed
at
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
cook
led
the
two
conspirators
along
the
gallery
,
and
from
thence
down
a
back
staircase
,
which
brought
them
to
a
small
door
communicating
with
the
garden
.
<EOS>
A
few
seconds
were
lost
in
opening
it
,
and
when
they
issued
forth
they
encountered
Hazlewood
and
his
men
,
who
instantly
arrested
them
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
conspirators
were
conveyed
under
a
strong
guard
to
London
,
where
they
were
committed
to
the
Tower
,
to
take
their
trial
with
their
confederates

VIVIANA
'S
<EOS>
LAST
NIGHT
<EOS>
AT
ORDSALL
HALLOn
the
evening
of
the
third
day
after
quitting
Dunchurch
<EOS>
,
Viviana
Radcliffe
and
her
companions
arrived
at
Ordsall
Hall
.
<EOS>
They
had
encountered
many
dangers
and
difficulties
on
the
journey
,
and
were
well
-
nigh
overcome
with
fatigue
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Fearful
of
being
detained
,
Garnet
had
avoided
all
the
larger
towns
in
the
way
,
and
had
consequently
been
driven
greatly
out
of
the
direct
course
.
<EOS>
He
had
assumed
the
disguise
which
he
usually
wore
when
travelling
,
that
of
a
lawyer
,
and
as
he
possessed
great
mimetic
talent
,
he
sustained
the
character
admirably
.
<EOS>
Viviana
passed
for
his
daughter
,
and
his
servant
,
Nicholas
Owen
,
who
was
almost
as
clever
an
actor
as
his
master
,
represented
his
clerk
,
while
the
two
attendants
performed
the
parts
of
clients
.
<EOS>
At
Abbots'-Bromley
,
where
they
halted
for
refreshment
on
the
second
day
,
having
spent
the
night
at
a
small
village
near
Lichfield
,
they
were
detained
by
the
landlord
,
who
entertained
some
suspicions
of
them
;
but
Garnet
succeeded
in
frightening
the
man
into
allowing
them
to
depart
.
<EOS>
They
underwent
another
alarm
of
the
same
kind
at
Leek
,
and
were
for
two
hours
locked
up
.
<EOS>
But
on
the
arrival
of
a
magistrate
,
who
had
been
sent
for
by
the
host
,
Garnet
gave
so
plausible
an
account
of
himself
that
the
party
were
instantly
set
at
liberty
,
and
arrived
without
further
molestation
at
their
journey
's
end
.
<EOS>
Viviana
's
last
visit
to
the
hall
had
been
sad
enough
,
but
it
was
not
so
sad
as
the
present
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
dull
November
evening
,
and
the
wind
moaned
dismally
through
the
trees
,
scattering
the
yellow
leaves
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
house
looked
forlorn
and
desolate
.
<EOS>
No
smoke
issued
from
the
chimneys
,
nor
was
there
any
external
indication
that
it
was
inhabited
.
<EOS>
The
drawbridge
was
down
,
and
as
they
passed
over
it
,
the
hollow
trampling
of
their
steeds
upon
the
planks
vibrated
painfully
upon
Viviana
's
heart
.
<EOS>
Before
dismounting
,
she
cast
a
wistful
look
around
,
and
surveyed
the
grass
-
grown
and
neglected
court
,
where
,
in
years
gone
by
,
she
had
sported
;
the
moat
on
whose
brink
she
had
lingered
;
and
the
surrounding
woods
,
which
she
had
never
looked
upon
,
even
on
a
dreary
day
like
the
present
,
and
when
they
were
robbed
in
some
measure
of
their
beauty
,
without
delight
.
<EOS>
Scanning
the
deserted
mansion
from
roof
to
foundation
,
she
traced
all
its
gables
,
angles
,
windows
,
doors
,
and
walls
,
and
claimed
every
piece
of
carved
work
,
every
stone
as
a
familiar
object
,
and
as
associated
with
other
and
happier
hours
.
<EOS>
"It
is
but
the
wreck
of
what
it
was
,
"
she
thought
.
<EOS>
"
The
spirit
that
animated
it
is
fled
.
<EOS>
Grass
grows
in
its
courts
—
no
cheerful
voices
echo
in
its
chambers
—
no
hospitality
is
maintained
in
its
hall
—
but
neglect
,
gloom
,
and
despair
claim
it
as
their
own
.
<EOS>
The
habitation
and
its
mistress
are
well
matched
.
<EOS>
"Guessing
<EOS>
from
the
melancholy
expression
of
her
countenance
what
was
passing
within
,
and
thinking
it
advisable
to
turn
the
current
of
her
thoughts
,
Garnet
assisted
her
to
alight
,
and
committing
the
care
of
their
steeds
to
Owen
and
the
others
,
proceeded
with
her
to
the
principal
entrance
.
<EOS>
Everything
appeared
in
nearly
the
same
state
as
when
they
had
last
seen
it
,
and
the
only
change
that
had
taken
place
was
for
the
worse
.
<EOS>
The
ceilings
were
mapped
and
mildewed
with
damps
;
the
once
-
gorgeously
stained
glass
was
shivered
in
the
windows
;
the
costly
arras
hung
in
tattered
fragments
from
the
walls
;
while
the
floors
,
which
were
still
strewn
with
plaster
and
broken
furniture
,
were
flooded
with
the
moisture
that
had
found
its
way
through
the
holes
in
the
roof
.
<EOS>
"Bear
up
,
dear
daughter
,
"
said
Garnet
,
observing
that
Viviana
was
greatly
distressed
by
the
sight
,
"
and
let
the
contemplation
of
this
scene
of
havoc
,
instead
of
casting
you
down
,
inspire
you
with
just
indignation
against
enemies
from
whom
it
is
vain
to
expect
justice
or
mercy
.
<EOS>
How
many
Catholic
mansions
have
been
thus
laid
waste
!
<EOS>
How
many
high
-
born
and
honourable
men
,
whose
sole
fault
was
their
adherence
to
the
religion
of
their
fathers
,
and
their
refusal
to
subscribe
to
doctrines
against
which
their
consciences
revolted
,
have
been
put
to
death
like
your
father
;
nay
,
have
endured
a
worse
fate
,
for
they
have
languished
out
their
lives
in
prison
,
while
their
families
and
retainers
have
undergone
every
species
of
outrage
!
<EOS>
How
many
a
descendant
of
a
proud
line
,
distinguished
for
worth
,
for
loyalty
,
and
for
devotion
,
has
stood
,
as
you
now
stand
,
upon
his
desolate
hearth
—
has
seen
misery
and
ruin
usurp
the
place
of
comfort
and
happiness
—
and
has
heard
the
very
stones
beneath
his
feet
cry
out
for
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Accursed
be
our
oppressors
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
lifting
up
his
hands
,
and
elevating
his
voice
.
"
<EOS>
May
their
churches
be
thrown
down
—
their
faith
crushed
—
their
rights
invaded
—
their
children
delivered
to
bondage
—
their
hearths
laid
waste
,
as
ours
have
been
.
<EOS>
May
this
,
and
worse
come
to
pass
,
till
the
whole
stock
of
heresy
is
uprooted!""Hold
,
father
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Viviana
,
"
even
here
,
beholding
this
miserable
sight
,
and
with
feelings
keenly
excited
,
I
can
not
join
in
your
terrible
denunciation
.
<EOS>
What
I
hope
for
—
what
I
pray
for
,
is
toleration
,
not
vengeance
.
<EOS>
The
sufferings
of
our
brethren
will
not
have
been
in
vain
,
if
they
enable
our
successors
to
worship
God
in
their
own
way
,
and
according
to
the
dictates
of
their
consciences
.
<EOS>
The
ruthless
conduct
of
our
persecutors
must
be
held
in
as
much
abhorrence
by
all
good
Protestants
as
our
persecution
of
that
sect
,
when
we
were
in
the
ascendant
,
is
regarded
by
all
worthy
members
of
our
own
Church
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
believe
that
by
persecution
we
can
work
out
the
charitable
precepts
inculcated
by
our
Saviour
,
and
I
am
sure
such
a
course
is
as
adverse
to
the
spirit
of
religion
as
it
is
to
that
of
humanity
.
<EOS>
Let
us
bear
our
sorrows
with
patience,—let
us
utter
no
repinings
,
but
turn
the
other
cheek
to
the
smiter
,
and
we
shall
find
,
in
due
time
,
that
the
hearts
of
our
oppressors
will
relent
,
and
that
all
the
believers
in
the
True
God
will
be
enabled
to
worship
him
in
peace
,
though
at
different
altars
.
<EOS>
""Such
<EOS>
a
season
will
never
arrive
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
severely
,
"
till
heresy
is
extirpated
,
and
the
false
doctrines
now
prevailing
utterly
abolished
.
<EOS>
Then
,
indeed
,
when
the
Church
of
Rome
is
re
-
established
,
and
the
old
and
true
religion
restored
,
universal
peace
will
prevail
.
<EOS>
And
let
me
correct
the
grievous
and
sinful
error
into
which
you
have
fallen
.
<EOS>
Our
church
is
always
at
war
with
heresy
;
and
if
it
can
not
uproot
it
by
gentle
means
,
authorizes
,
nay
enjoins
<EOS>
the
employment
of
force
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
attempt
to
dispute
with
you
upon
points
of
faith
,
father
,
"
returned
Viviana
;
"
I
am
content
to
think
and
act
according
to
my
own
feelings
and
convictions
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
give
up
the
hope
that
in
some
milder
and
wiser
age
,
persecution
on
either
side
will
cease
,
and
the
sufferings
of
its
victims
be
remembered
only
to
soften
the
hearts
of
fanatics
,
of
whatever
creed
,
towards
each
other
.
<EOS>
Were
a
lesson
wanting
to
ourselves
,
surely
it
might
be
found
in
the
result
that
has
attended
your
dark
and
criminal
enterprise
,
and
in
which
the
disapproval
of
Heaven
has
been
signally
manifested
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
An
action
is
not
to
be
judged
or
justified
by
the
event
attending
it
,
but
by
its
own
intrinsic
merits
.
<EOS>
To
aver
the
contrary
were
to
throw
a
doubt
upon
the
Holy
Scriptures
themselves
,
where
we
read
in
the
Book
of
Judges
that
the
eleven
tribes
of
Israel
were
commanded
to
make
war
upon
the
tribe
of
Benjamin
,
and
yet
were
twice
defeated
.
<EOS>
We
have
failed
.
<EOS>
But
this
proves
nothing
against
our
project
,
which
I
maintain
to
be
righteous
and
praiseworthy
,
undertaken
to
overthrow
an
heretical
and
excommunicated
monarch
,
and
to
re
-
establish
the
true
faith
of
the
Most
High
throughout
this
land
.
<EOS>
""I
lament
to
find
that
you
still
persist
in
error
,
father
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Viviana
;
"
but
you
can
not
by
any
sophistry
induce
me
to
coincide
with
you
in
opinion
.
<EOS>
I
hold
the
attempt
an
offence
alike
against
God
and
man
,
and
while
I
rejoice
at
the
issue
that
has
attended
it
,
I
deplore
the
irreparable
harm
it
will
do
to
the
whole
body
of
Catholics
,
all
of
whom
will
be
connected
,
by
the
bigoted
and
unthinking
of
the
hostile
party
,
with
the
atrocious
design
.
<EOS>
Not
only
have
you
done
our
cause
an
injury
,
but
you
have
in
a
measure
justified
our
opponents
'
severity
,
and
given
them
a
plea
for
further
persecution
.
<EOS>
""No
more
of
this
,
daughter
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
,
impatiently
,
"
or
I
shall
deem
it
necessary
to
reprove
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
search
the
house
,
and
try
to
find
some
habitable
chamber
in
which
you
can
pass
the
night
.
<EOS>
"After
<EOS>
a
long
search
,
they
discovered
a
room
in
comparatively
good
order
,
and
leaving
Viviana
within
it
,
Garnet
descended
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
where
he
found
Nicholas
Owen
,
and
the
two
other
attendants
.
"We
<EOS>
have
chanced
upon
a
scanty
supply
of
provender
for
our
steeds
,
"
remarked
Owen
,
with
a
doleful
look
;
"
but
we
are
not
likely
to
obtain
a
meal
ourselves
,
unless
we
can
feed
upon
rats
and
mice
,
which
appear
to
be
the
sole
tenants
of
this
miserable
dwelling
.
<EOS>
""You
must
go
to
Manchester
instantly
,
and
procure
provisions
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
But
take
heed
you
observe
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Owen
,
"
If
I
am
taken
,
your
reverence
will
lose
your
supper
—
that
is
all
.
"He
<EOS>
then
set
out
upon
his
errand
,
and
Garnet
proceeded
to
the
kitchen
,
where
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
he
found
the
hearthstone
still
warm
,
and
a
few
lighted
embers
upon
it
,
<EOS>
while
crumbs
of
bread
,
and
little
fragments
of
meat
scattered
about
,
proved
that
some
one
had
taken
a
meal
there
.
<EOS>
Startled
by
this
discovery
,
he
continued
his
search
,
but
as
fruitlessly
as
before
;
and
though
he
called
to
any
one
who
might
be
hidden
to
come
forth
,
the
summons
was
unanswered
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
attendants
had
placed
a
few
sticks
upon
the
smouldering
ashes
,
and
on
returning
to
the
kitchen
,
it
was
found
that
they
had
kindled
.
<EOS>
A
fire
being
thus
obtained
,
some
of
the
broken
furniture
was
used
to
replenish
it
,
and
by
Garnet
's
commands
another
fire
was
speedily
lighted
in
Viviana
's
chamber
.
<EOS>
Night
had
now
come
on
,
and
Owen
not
returning
,
Garnet
became
extremely
uneasy
,
and
had
almost
given
him
up
,
when
the
absentee
made
his
appearance
,
with
a
large
basket
of
provisions
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
"I
have
had
some
difficulty
in
obtaining
them
,
"
he
said
;
"
and
fancying
I
observed
two
persons
following
me
,
was
obliged
to
take
a
circuitous
route
to
get
back
.
<EOS>
The
whole
town
is
in
commotion
about
the
plot
,
and
it
is
said
that
the
most
rigorous
measures
are
to
be
adopted
towards
all
the
Catholic
families
in
the
neighbourhood
.
"Sighing
<EOS>
at
the
latter
piece
of
intelligence
,
Garnet
selected
such
provisions
as
he
thought
would
be
acceptable
to
Viviana
,
and
took
them
upstairs
to
her
.
<EOS>
She
ate
a
little
bread
,
and
drank
a
cup
of
water
,
but
refused
to
taste
anything
else
,
and
finding
it
in
vain
to
press
her
,
Garnet
returned
to
the
kitchen
,
where
,
being
much
exhausted
,
he
recruited
himself
with
a
hearty
meal
and
a
cup
of
wine
.
<EOS>
Left
alone
,
Viviana
knelt
down
,
and
clasping
a
small
crucifix
to
her
breast
,
prayed
long
and
fervently
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
thus
engaged
,
she
heard
the
door
open
gently
behind
her
,
and
turning
her
head
,
beheld
an
old
man
clothed
in
a
tattered
garb
,
with
long
white
hair
flowing
over
his
shoulders
,
and
a
beard
of
the
same
snowy
hue
descending
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
As
he
advanced
slowly
towards
her
,
she
started
to
her
feet
,
and
a
brighter
flame
arising
at
the
moment
from
the
fire
,
it
illumined
the
intruder
's
wobegone
features
.
<EOS>
"Is
it
possible
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
she
exclaimed,—"can
it
be
my
father
's
old
steward
,
Jerome
Heydocke?""It
is
,
indeed
,
my
dear
young
mistress
,
"
replied
the
old
man
,
falling
on
his
knee
before
her
.
"
<EOS>
Heaven
be
praised
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
seizing
her
hand
,
and
bedewing
it
with
tears
;
"
I
have
seen
you
once
again
,
and
shall
die
content
.
<EOS>
""I
never
expected
to
behold
you
more
,
good
Heydocke
,
"
returned
Viviana
,
raising
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
heard
you
had
died
in
prison
.
<EOS>
""It
was
so
given
out
by
the
jailers
,
to
account
for
my
escape
,
"
replied
the
old
steward
;
"
and
I
took
care
never
to
contradict
the
report
by
making
my
appearance
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
distress
you
by
the
recital
of
all
I
have
endured
,
but
will
simply
state
that
I
was
confined
in
the
prison
upon
Hunt
's
Bank
,
<EOS>
whence
I
escaped
in
the
night
by
dropping
upon
the
rocks
,
and
from
them
into
the
river
,
where
it
was
supposed
I
was
drowned
.
<EOS>
Making
my
way
into
the
country
,
I
concealed
myself
for
a
time
in
barns
and
out
-
buildings
,
until
,
at
length
,
I
ventured
back
to
the
old
house
,
and
have
dwelt
in
it
unmolested
ever
since
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
perished
of
want
long
ago
,
but
for
the
kindness
of
Mr.
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
He
used
to
send
my
son
regularly
to
me
with
provisions
;
and
,
now
that
Martin
is
gone
to
London
,
on
business
,
as
I
understood
,
relating
to
you
,
he
brings
them
to
me
himself
.
<EOS>
He
will
be
here
to
-
morrow
.
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
him
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
please
,
"
returned
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
those
are
your
companions
below
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
my
hiding
-
place
,
and
hearing
voices
and
footsteps
,
did
not
dare
to
venture
forth
till
all
was
still
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
this
room
,
which
I
have
been
in
the
habit
of
occupying
lately
,
and
peeping
through
the
door
,
which
was
standing
ajar
,
I
perceived
a
female
figure
,
and
thinking
it
must
be
you
,
though
I
scarcely
dared
to
trust
the
evidence
of
my
senses
,
I
ventured
in
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
dear
young
mistress
,
what
a
joy
it
is
to
see
you
again
!
<EOS>
I
fear
you
must
have
suffered
much
,
for
you
are
greatly
altered
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
,
Garnet
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
He
started
on
seeing
the
old
steward
.
<EOS>
But
an
explanation
was
instantly
given
him
.
<EOS>
"You
,
then
,
are
the
person
by
whom
the
fire
was
recently
lighted
in
the
kitchen
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Heydocke
replied
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"I
came
to
bid
you
farewell
for
the
night
,
dear
daughter
,
"
said
Garnet
,
"
and
to
assure
you
that
you
may
rest
without
fear
,
for
we
have
contrived
to
make
fast
the
doors
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
,
my
son
,
"
he
added
to
the
steward
,
"
and
you
shall
have
a
comfortable
meal
below
.
<EOS>
"Making
<EOS>
a
profound
reverence
to
Viviana
<EOS>
,
the
old
man
followed
him
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
Viviana
continued
to
pace
to
and
fro
within
her
chamber
for
some
time
,
and
then
,
overcome
with
fatigue
,
flung
herself
upon
the
bedstead
,
on
which
a
cloak
had
been
thrown
.
<EOS>
Sleep
soon
closed
her
eyes
,
but
it
was
disturbed
by
frightful
and
distressing
dreams
,
from
which
she
was
suddenly
aroused
by
a
touch
upon
the
arm
.
<EOS>
Starting
up
,
she
perceived
the
old
steward
by
the
side
of
her
couch
,
with
a
light
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"What
brings
you
here
,
Heydocke
?
<EOS>
"
she
demanded
,
with
surprise
and
alarm
.
<EOS>
"You
have
slept
soundly
,
my
dear
young
mistress
,
or
you
would
not
require
to
be
informed
,
"
replied
the
steward
.
<EOS>
"
There
!
do
you
not
hear
it
?
"
he
added
,
as
a
loud
knocking
resounded
from
below
.
<EOS>
Viviana
listened
for
a
moment
,
and
then
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
,
hurried
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
She
found
Garnet
and
the
others
assembled
in
the
hall
,
but
wholly
unnerved
by
fright
.
"
<EOS>
Hide
yourselves
,
"
she
said
,
"
and
no
ill
shall
befal
you
.
<EOS>
Quick!—not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost!"Having
allowed
them
sufficient
time
for
concealment
,
she
demanded
in
a
loud
voice
who
was
without?"Friends
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
voice
of
Doctor
Dee
,
"
replied
Heydocke
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Admit
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
"Heydocke
obeyed
,
and
throwing
open
the
door
,
gave
entrance
to
the
Doctor
,
who
was
wrapped
in
his
long
furred
gown
,
and
carried
a
lantern
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
Kelley
and
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
visit
is
singularly
timed
,
Mr.
Chetham
,
"
said
Viviana
,
after
she
had
saluted
the
party
;
"
but
you
are
not
the
less
welcome
on
that
account
.
<EOS>
I
much
desired
to
see
you
,
and
indeed
should
have
sent
for
you
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
But
how
did
you
know
I
was
<EOS>
here?""The
<EOS>
only
explanation
<EOS>
I
can
offer
you
<EOS>
is
this
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
hastily
summoned
from
my
residence
at
Crumpsall
by
Kelley
,
who
told
me
you
were
at
Ordsall
Hall
,
and
that
Doctor
Dee
was
about
to
visit
you
,
and
desired
my
company
.
<EOS>
Thus
summoned
,
I
came
at
once
.
<EOS>
""A
strange
explanation
indeed
!
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"Close
<EOS>
and
fasten
the
door
,
"
said
Dee
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
to
Kelley
,
and
as
soon
as
his
commands
were
obeyed
,
he
took
Viviana
's
hand
,
and
led
her
to
the
farther
end
of
the
hall
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
art
informed
me
of
your
arrival
,
Viviana
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
save
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
in
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
well
know
it
,
"
she
replied
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
no
wish
to
fly
from
justice
.
<EOS>
I
am
weary
of
my
life
,
and
would
gladly
resign
it
.
<EOS>
""I
would
call
to
your
recollection
,
Viviana
,
"
pursued
Dee
,
"
that
I
foretold
the
disastrous
result
of
this
plot
,
in
which
you
have
become
unhappily
involved
,
to
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
warned
him
not
to
proceed
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
be
advised
,
and
is
now
a
prisoner
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
I
wish
is
to
go
thither
,
and
die
with
him
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
go
thither
,
you
will
die
before
him
,
"
said
Dee
.
<EOS>
"I
would
do
so
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
Radcliffe
,
"
returned
Dee
,
in
a
compassionate
tone
,
"
I
truly
grieve
for
you
.
<EOS>
Your
attachment
to
this
heinous
traitor
completely
blinds
you
.
<EOS>
The
friendship
I
entertained
for
your
mother
makes
me
anxious
to
serve
you
—
to
see
you
happy
.
<EOS>
It
is
now
in
your
power
to
be
so
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
take
another
false
step
,
your
fate
is
decided
,
and
you
will
die
an
early
death
.
<EOS>
I
will
answer
for
your
safety
—
nay
,
what
is
more
,
I
will
undertake
that
ere
long
you
shall
again
be
mistress
of
this
mansion
,
and
have
your
estates
restored
to
you
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
promise
fairly
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
mournful
smile
.
<EOS>
"I
have
not
yet
done
,
"
pursued
Dee
.
<EOS>
"
All
I
require
for
the
service
is
,
that
when
freed
by
the
death
of
Guy
Fawkes
from
the
chain
that
now
binds
you,—for
I
am
aware
of
your
ill
-
starred
union
with
him,—you
<EOS>
shall
bestow
your
hand
upon
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
""It
may
not
be
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
firmly
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
could
in
truth
read
the
secrets
of
the
heart
,
you
would
know
that
mine
would
instantly
reject
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
""Think
<EOS>
not
it
originates
with
me
,
Viviana
,
"
said
Humphrey
Chetham
,
who
had
approached
them
unobserved
.
<EOS>
"
My
previous
experience
of
your
character
would
alone
have
prevented
me
from
becoming
a
party
to
any
such
proposal
,
had
I
known
it
would
be
made
.
<EOS>
Do
not
,
I
beseech
you
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
he
added
to
Dee
,
"
clog
your
offer
with
conditions
which
will
effectually
prevent
its
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
""You
are
true
to
yourself
,
Mr.
Chetham
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
,
"
and
will
not
,
therefore
,
wonder
that
I
continue
so
.
<EOS>
Were
I
to
assent
to
Doctor
Dee
's
proposal
,
I
should
be
further
from
happiness
than
I
am
now
,
even
if
he
could
make
good
his
words
,
and
restore
me
to
the
station
I
have
forfeited
.
<EOS>
I
have
received
a
shock
from
which
I
shall
never
recover
,
and
the
only
haven
of
repose
to
which
I
look
forward
is
the
grave
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Chetham
,
in
a
pitying
tone
.
<EOS>
"You
will
think
I
trespass
too
much
upon
your
kindness
,
"
she
pursued
;
"
but
you
can
render
me
a
great
service
,
and
it
will
be
the
last
I
shall
ever
require
from
you
.
<EOS>
""Name
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Chetham
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
would
beg
you
to
escort
me
to
London
,
"
she
rejoined
:
"
and
to
deliver
me
to
the
lords
of
the
council
.
<EOS>
I
would
willingly
escape
the
indignities
to
which
T
shall
be
exposed
if
I
am
conveyed
thither
as
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Will
you
do
this?""I
will
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Lest
<EOS>
you
should
think
I
have
offered
more
than
I
can
perform
,
Viviana
,
"
said
Dee
,
who
had
listened
attentively
to
the
foregoing
conversation
,
"
I
will
now
tell
you
on
what
grounds
<EOS>
I
build
my
expectation
of
procuring
your
pardon
.
<EOS>
The
conspiracy
was
first
revealed
by
me
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
though
for
his
own
purposes
he
kept
it
secret
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
He
owes
me
a
heavy
debt
,
and
shall
pay
it
in
the
way
I
propose
,
if
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
""I
will
abide
by
what
I
have
done
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
know
,
then
,
what
fate
awaits
you
?
"
said
Dee
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
not
shrink
from
it
,
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"It
is
well
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Before
I
leave
,
I
will
give
you
another
caution
.
<EOS>
Father
Garnet
is
here
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
attempt
not
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
deceive
me
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
desire
to
serve
,
not
harm
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
remains
here
till
to
-
morrow
,
he
will
be
captured
.
<EOS>
A
proclamation
has
been
issued
for
his
arrest
,
as
well
as
for
that
of
Father
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
Deliver
him
this
warning
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
farewell!"With
this
,
he
took
up
his
lantern
,
and
followed
by
Kelley
,
quitted
the
hall
.
<EOS>
Humphrey
Chetham
only
tarried
a
few
moments
to
inform
Viviana
that
he
would
return
soon
after
daybreak
with
a
couple
of
steeds
for
the
journey
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
Viviana
communicated
Dee
's
warning
to
Garnet
,
who
was
so
alarmed
by
it
,
that
he
resolved
not
to
delay
his
own
departure
a
moment
.
<EOS>
Taking
an
affectionate
leave
of
Viviana
,
and
confiding
her
to
the
care
of
the
old
steward
,
he
set
out
with
his
three
attendants
.
<EOS>
Faithful
to
his
promise
,
Humphrey
Chetham
appeared
at
the
appointed
time
.
<EOS>
Viviana
bade
an
eternal
farewell
to
the
old
steward
,
who
was
overwhelmed
with
grief
,
and
looked
as
if
his
sorrows
would
soon
be
ended
,
and
mounting
one
of
the
steeds
brought
by
the
young
merchant
,
they
took
the
direction
of
London
.

<EOS>
—
HENDLIPGarnet
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
for
some
miles
before
he
acquainted
his
companions
<EOS>
whither
he
was
going
.
<EOS>
He
then
informed
Nicholas
Owen
,
who
rode
by
his
side
,
that
he
should
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
Hendlip
House
,
the
seat
of
Mr.
Thomas
Abingdon
,
near
Droitwich
,
in
Worcestershire
,
where
he
knew
that
Father
Oldcorne
and
Anne
Vaux
had
retired
,
and
where
he
was
certain
to
meet
with
a
friendly
reception
and
protection
.
<EOS>
Owen
,
who
was
completely
in
his
master
's
confidence
,
agreed
that
no
safer
asylum
could
be
found
,
and
they
pursued
their
journey
with
so
much
ardour
,
that
early
on
the
following
night
they
arrived
within
a
short
distance
of
the
mansion
.
<EOS>
Owen
was
sent
forward
to
reconnoitre
,
and
returned
in
about
half
an
hour
with
Mr.
Abingdon
,
who
embraced
Garnet
,
and
told
him
he
was
truly
happy
in
being
able
to
offer
him
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
think
it
will
prove
a
secure
one
,
"
he
added
.
<EOS>
"
There
are
so
many
hiding
-
places
in
the
old
house
,
that
if
it
is
beset
for
a
year
you
will
scarcely
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
of
the
fate
of
your
confederates?""Alas
!
<EOS>
no
,
my
son
,
"
replied
Garnet
;
"
and
I
tremble
to
ask
it
.
<EOS>
""It
<EOS>
had
better
be
told
at
once
,
"
rejoined
Abingdon
.
<EOS>
"
Catesby
,
Percy
,
and
the
two
Wrights
,
have
been
slain
in
the
defence
of
Holbeach
;
while
Rookwood
,
Grant
,
and
Thomas
Winter
,
all
of
whom
were
severely
wounded
in
the
siege
,
have
been
made
prisoners
,
and
are
now
on
their
way
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
""A
fearful
catalogue
of
ills
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"It
is
not
yet
complete
,
"
pursued
Abingdon
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Digby
has
been
defeated
,
and
made
prisoner
in
an
attempt
to
bring
additional
force
to
his
friends
,
and
Keyes
has
been
arrested
in
Warwickshire
.
<EOS>
""These
are
woful
tidings
<EOS>
truly
,
my
son
,
"
returned
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
Heaven
's
will
be
done!"He
then
dismissed
his
two
attendants
,
to
whom
he
gave
a
sum
of
money
,
together
with
the
steeds
,
and
attended
by
Nicholas
Owen
,
repaired
to
the
house
with
Mr.
Abingdon
,
who
admitted
them
through
a
secret
door
.
<EOS>
Hendlip
House
,
which
,
unfortunately
for
the
lovers
of
picturesque
and
storied
habitations
,
was
pulled
down
a
few
years
ago
,
having
been
latterly
used
as
a
ladies
'
boarding
-
school
,
was
a
large
and
irregular
structure
,
with
walls
of
immense
thickness
,
tall
stacks
of
chimneys
,
turrets
,
oriel
windows
,
and
numberless
projections
,
contrived
to
mask
the
labyrinths
and
secret
chambers
within
.
<EOS>
Erected
by
John
Abingdon
,
father
of
the
proprietor
at
the
period
of
this
history
,
and
cofferer
to
Queen
Elizabeth
in
the
early
part
of
the
reign
of
that
princess
,
it
was
filled
with
secret
staircases
,
masked
entrances
,
trap
-
doors
,
vaults
,
subterranean
passages
,
secret
recesses
,
and
every
other
description
of
hiding
-
place
.
<EOS>
An
immense
gallery
surrounded
three
sides
of
the
entrance
-
hall
,
containing
on
each
side
a
large
chimney
-
piece
,
surmounted
by
a
shield
displaying
the
arms
of
the
family
—
argent
,
a
bend
,
gules
,
three
eaglets
displayed
,
or
.
<EOS>
Behind
each
of
these
chimney
-
pieces
was
a
small
cell
,
or
"
priest's
-
hole
,
"
as
it
was
termed
,
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
mansion
,
the
chambers
were
so
sombre
,
and
the
passages
so
numerous
and
intricate
,
that
,
in
the
words
of
one
who
described
it
from
personal
observation
,
the
whole
place
presented
"
a
picture
of
gloom
,
insecurity
,
and
suspicion
.
"
<EOS>
Standing
on
an
elevated
situation
,
it
commanded
the
country
on
all
sides
,
and
could
not
be
approached
during
the
day
-
time
without
alarm
being
given
to
its
inmates
.
<EOS>
Thomas
Abingdon
,
the
owner
of
the
mansion
at
the
period
in
question
,
and
the
eldest
son
of
its
founder
,
was
born
at
Thorpe
,
near
Chertsey
,
in
Surrey
,
in
1560
.
<EOS>
He
was
educated
at
Oxford
,
and
finished
his
studies
at
the
Universities
of
Paris
and
Rheims
.
<EOS>
A
man
of
considerable
taste
and
learning
,
but
of
a
plotting
disposition
,
he
became
a
willing
tool
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
immediately
on
his
return
to
England
,
connected
himself
with
the
different
conspiracies
set
on
foot
for
the
liberation
of
the
imprisoned
Queen
of
Scots
.
<EOS>
For
these
offences
he
was
imprisoned
in
the
Tower
for
the
term
of
six
years
,
and
only
escaped
death
from
the
fact
of
his
being
the
Queen
's
godson
,
coupled
with
the
estimation
in
which
she
had
held
his
father
.
<EOS>
On
his
liberation
,
he
remained
perfectly
tranquil
till
the
accession
of
James
,
when
he
became
a
secret
plotter
against
that
monarch
.
<EOS>
His
concealment
of
the
two
priests
,
about
to
be
related
,
occasioned
his
being
again
sent
to
the
Tower
,
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
intercession
of
Lord
Mounteagle
,
whose
sister
he
had
espoused
,
he
would
have
been
executed
.
<EOS>
He
was
pardoned
on
condition
of
never
stirring
beyond
the
precincts
of
Worcestershire
,
and
he
employed
his
retirement
in
compiling
an
account
of
the
antiquities
of
that
county
,
which
he
left
behind
him
in
manuscript
,
and
of
which
Doctor
Nash
,
its
more
recent
historian
,
has
largely
availed
himself
.
<EOS>
With
a
habitation
so
contrived
,
Mr.
Abingdon
might
fairly
promise
his
guests
a
safe
asylum
.
<EOS>
Conducting
them
along
a
secret
passage
to
a
chamber
of
which
he
alone
possessed
the
key
,
he
left
Garnet
within
it
,
and
taking
Owen
with
him
to
another
place
of
concealment
,
returned
shortly
afterwards
with
Anne
Vaux
and
Father
Oldcorne
.
<EOS>
The
two
priests
tenderly
embraced
each
other
,
and
Oldcorne
poured
forth
his
tears
on
his
superior
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
Garnet
next
turned
to
Anne
Vaux
,
between
whom
and
himself
,
as
has
been
before
mentioned
,
an
affectionate
intimacy
subsisted
,
and
found
her
quite
overcome
by
her
feelings
.
<EOS>
Supper
was
now
served
to
Garnet
by
a
confidential
servant
,
and
after
a
few
hours
spent
in
conversation
with
his
friends
,
during
which
they
discussed
the
disastrous
issue
of
the
affair
,
and
the
probable
fate
of
the
conspirators
,
they
quitted
him
,
and
he
retired
to
rest
—
but
not
before
he
had
returned
thanks
to
Heaven
for
enabling
him
once
more
to
lay
down
his
head
in
safety
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
morning
,
he
was
visited
by
Mrs.
Abingdon
,
a
lady
of
considerable
personal
attractions
,
and
Anne
Vaux
;
and
when
he
had
recovered
from
the
fatigue
of
his
journey
,
and
the
anxieties
he
had
recently
undergone
,
he
experienced
great
delight
in
their
society
.
<EOS>
The
chamber
he
occupied
was
lighted
by
a
small
loop
-
hole
,
which
enabled
him
to
breathe
the
fresh
air
,
and
gaze
upon
the
surrounding
country
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
nearly
two
months
passed
on
,
during
which
,
though
rigorous
inquiries
were
made
throughout
the
country
,
no
clue
was
found
by
the
searchers
to
lead
them
to
Hendlip
;
and
the
concealed
parties
began
to
indulge
hopes
that
they
should
escape
detection
altogether
.
<EOS>
Being
in
constant
correspondence
with
her
brother
,
Lord
Mounteagle
,
though
she
did
not
trust
him
with
the
important
secret
of
the
concealment
of
the
priests
,
Mrs.
Abingdon
ascertained
all
that
was
done
in
reference
to
the
conspirators
,
whose
trials
were
now
approaching
,
and
communicated
the
intelligence
to
Garnet
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
of
the
20th
of
January
,
and
when
long
quietude
had
bred
complete
fancied
security
in
Garnet
,
Anne
Vaux
and
Mrs.
Abingdon
suddenly
entered
his
chamber
,
and
with
countenances
of
the
utmost
alarm
,
informed
him
that
Mr.
Abingdon
's
confidential
servant
had
just
returned
from
Worcester
,
where
his
master
then
was
,
and
had
brought
word
that
Topcliffe
,
armed
with
a
search
-
warrant
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
had
just
passed
through
that
city
on
his
way
to
Holt
Castle
,
the
residence
of
Sir
Henry
Bromley
.
<EOS>
"It
appears
,
"
said
Mrs.
Abingdon
,
"
that
Humphrey
Littleton
,
who
has
been
apprehended
and
condemned
to
death
at
Worcester
for
harbouring
his
brother
and
Robert
Winter
,
has
sought
to
procure
a
remission
of
his
sentence
by
betraying
your
retreat
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
,
Topcliffe
has
been
sent
down
from
London
,
with
a
warrant
addressed
to
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
to
aid
him
in
searching
Hendlip
.
<EOS>
My
husband
has
given
particular
orders
that
you
are
to
be
removed
to
the
most
secure
hiding
-
place
without
delay
;
and
he
deeply
regrets
that
he
himself
can
not
return
till
evening
,
for
fear
of
exciting
suspicion
.
<EOS>
""Take
me
where
you
please
,
daughter
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
who
was
thrown
into
great
perturbation
by
the
intelligence
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
myself
prepared
for
any
emergency
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
wofully
deceived
.
<EOS>
""Be
not
alarmed
,
father
,
"
said
Anne
Vaux
,
in
an
encouraging
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Let
them
search
as
long
as
they
will
,
they
will
never
discover
your
retreat
.
<EOS>
""I
have
a
strong
presentiment
to
the
contrary
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Oldcorne
made
his
appearance
,
and
on
learning
the
alarming
news
,
was
as
much
dismayed
as
his
superior
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
consultation
,
and
while
the
priests
were
putting
aside
every
article
necessary
to
be
removed
,
Mrs.
Abingdon
proceeded
to
the
gallery
,
and
contrived
on
some
plausible
pretext
to
send
away
the
whole
of
the
domestics
from
this
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
hastily
returned
,
and
conducted
the
two
priests
to
one
of
the
large
fire
-
places
.
<EOS>
A
raised
stone
about
two
feet
high
occupied
the
inside
of
the
chimney
,
and
upon
it
stood
an
immense
pair
of
iron
dogs
.
<EOS>
Obeying
Mrs.
Abingdon
's
directions
,
Garnet
got
upon
the
stone
,
and
setting
his
foot
on
the
large
iron
knob
on
the
left
,
found
a
few
projections
in
the
masonry
on
the
side
,
up
which
he
mounted
,
and
opening
a
small
door
,
made
of
planks
of
wood
,
covered
with
bricks
,
and
coloured
black
,
so
as
not
to
be
distinguishable
from
the
walls
of
the
chimney
,
crept
into
a
recess
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
.
<EOS>
This
cell
was
about
two
feet
wide
,
and
four
high
,
and
was
connected
with
another
chimney
at
the
back
,
by
means
of
three
or
four
small
holes
.
<EOS>
Around
its
sides
ran
a
narrow
stone
shelf
,
just
wide
enough
to
afford
an
uncomfortable
seat
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
followed
by
Oldcorne
,
who
brought
with
him
a
quantity
of
books
,
vestments
,
and
sacred
vessels
used
in
the
performance
of
the
rites
of
the
Church
of
Rome
.
<EOS>
These
articles
,
which
afterwards
occasioned
them
much
inconvenience
,
they
did
not
dare
to
leave
behind
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
them
safely
bestowed
,
Mrs.
Abingdon
and
her
companion
went
in
search
of
provisions
,
and
brought
them
a
piece
of
cold
meat
and
a
pasty
,
together
with
some
bread
,
dried
fruit
,
conserves
,
and
a
flask
of
wine
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
dare
to
bring
more
,
for
fear
of
exciting
the
suspicion
of
the
household
.
<EOS>
Their
next
care
was
to
conduct
Owen
,
and
Oldcorne
's
servant
,
Chambers
,
to
a
similar
retreat
in
one
of
the
other
chimneys
,
and
to
provide
them
with
a
scanty
supply
of
provisions
and
a
flask
of
wine
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
accomplished
without
being
noticed
by
any
of
the
domestics
.
<EOS>
As
may
be
imagined
,
a
most
anxious
day
was
passed
by
all
parties
.
<EOS>
Towards
evening
,
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
the
sheriff
of
the
county
,
accompanied
by
Topcliffe
,
and
attended
by
a
troop
of
soldiers
,
appeared
at
the
gates
of
the
mansion
,
and
demanded
admittance
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
moment
,
Mr.
Abingdon
rode
up
,
and
affecting
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
saluted
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
with
whom
he
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
,
and
inquired
his
business
.
<EOS>
"You
are
charged
with
harbouring
two
Jesuit
priests
,
Fathers
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
,
supposed
to
be
connected
with
the
late
atrocious
conspiracy
against
the
King
,
Mr.
Abingdon
,
"
interposed
Topcliffe
;
"
and
I
brought
a
warrant
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
which
I
have
delivered
to
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
commanding
him
to
search
your
house
for
them
.
<EOS>
""I
was
loth
to
accept
the
office
,
Mr.
Abingdon
,
"
said
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
who
was
a
handsome
,
middle
-
aged
man
;
"
but
my
duty
to
my
sovereign
allows
me
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
I
trust
,
though
a
Catholic
,
that
you
share
my
own
detestation
of
this
diabolical
plot
,
and
would
not
shelter
any
of
its
contrivers
,
or
abettors
.
<EOS>
""You
judge
me
rightly
,
Sir
Henry
,
"
replied
Abingdon
,
who
,
meanwhile
,
had
received
a
private
signal
from
his
confidential
servant
that
all
was
safe
,
"
I
would
not
.
<EOS>
I
am
just
returned
from
Worcester
,
where
I
have
been
for
the
last
two
days
.
<EOS>
Enter
my
house
,
I
pray
you
,
and
search
every
corner
of
it
;
and
if
you
find
a
Jesuit
priest
concealed
within
it
,
you
shall
hang
me
at
my
own
gate
.
<EOS>
""You
must
be
misinformed
,
sir
,
"
observed
Sir
Henry
,
who
was
completely
imposed
upon
by
Abingdon
's
unconcerned
demeanour
;
"
they
can
not
be
here
.
<EOS>
""Trust
<EOS>
me
,
they
are
,
"
returned
the
other
,
"
and
I
should
like
to
take
him
at
his
word
.
<EOS>
"Giving
<EOS>
directions
to
the
band
to
environ
the
house
,
and
guard
all
its
approaches
,
so
as
to
prevent
any
one
from
escaping
from
it
<EOS>
,
Topcliffe
took
half
-
a
-
dozen
men
with
him
,
and
instructed
them
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
They
first
repaired
to
the
great
dining
-
chamber
,
where
,
in
accordance
with
the
instructions
received
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
Topcliffe
proceeded
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
and
directed
his
men
to
break
down
the
wainscot
.
<EOS>
With
some
difficulty
,
the
order
was
obeyed
,
and
the
entrance
to
a
vault
discovered
,
into
which
Topcliffe
descended
but
he
found
nothing
to
repay
his
trouble
.
<EOS>
Returning
to
the
dining
-
chamber
,
he
questioned
Mr.
Abingdon
,
who
secretly
enjoyed
his
disappointment
,
as
to
the
use
of
the
vault
,
but
the
latter
professed
entire
ignorance
of
its
existence
.
<EOS>
The
searchers
next
proceeded
to
the
cellar
,
and
bored
the
floors
with
a
broach
to
a
considerable
depth
,
to
try
whether
there
were
any
vaults
beneath
them
,
but
they
made
no
discovery
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
Topcliffe
hurried
upstairs
,
and
examined
the
size
of
the
rooms
,
to
see
whether
they
corresponded
with
those
below
;
and
wherever
any
difference
was
observable
,
he
caused
the
panels
to
be
pulled
down
,
and
holes
broken
in
the
walls
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
several
secret
passages
were
discovered
,
one
of
which
led
to
the
chamber
lately
occupied
by
Garnet
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
discovery
,
the
searchers
continued
their
operations
to
a
late
hour
,
when
they
desisted
for
the
night
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
they
resumed
their
task
,
and
Sir
Henry
Bromley
took
a
general
survey
of
the
house
,
both
externally
and
internally
,
noting
the
appearances
outside
,
and
seeing
that
they
corresponded
with
the
rooms
within
.
<EOS>
The
three
extraordinary
chimney
-
pieces
in
the
gallery
attracted
Topcliffe
's
attention
;
but
the
contrivances
within
were
so
well
managed
,
that
they
escaped
his
notice
.
<EOS>
He
even
got
into
the
chimneys
,
and
examined
the
walls
on
either
side
,
but
could
detect
nothing
.
<EOS>
And
,
lastly
,
he
ordered
large
fires
to
be
lighted
within
them
,
but
the
experiment
proving
fruitless
,
he
turned
his
attention
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Abingdon
had
attended
him
during
this
part
of
the
search
,
and
,
though
he
preserved
an
unmoved
exterior
,
he
was
full
of
apprehension
,
and
was
greatly
relieved
when
it
was
abandoned
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
same
day
,
two
other
hiding
-
places
were
found
in
the
thickness
of
the
walls
,
but
nothing
was
discovered
within
them
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
prevent
any
communication
with
the
concealed
persons
,
Topcliffe
stationed
a
sentinel
at
the
door
of
Mr.
Abingdon
's
chamber
,
and
another
at
that
of
Anne
Vaux
.
<EOS>
On
the
third
day
the
search
was
continued
more
rigorously
than
ever
.
<EOS>
Wainscots
were
taken
down
;
walls
broken
open
;
the
boards
of
the
floor
removed
;
and
other
secret
passages
,
vaults
,
and
hiding
-
places
discovered
.
<EOS>
Some
priests
'
vestments
and
articles
used
in
the
Romish
service
were
found
in
one
of
these
places
,
and
shown
to
Mr.
Abingdon
.
<EOS>
He
at
first
denied
all
knowledge
of
them
;
but
when
Topcliffe
brought
forward
the
title
-
deeds
of
his
property
,
which
had
been
found
in
the
same
place
,
he
was
obliged
to
confess
he
had
put
them
there
himself
.
<EOS>
Still
,
though
these
discoveries
had
been
made
,
the
searchers
were
as
far
from
their
aim
as
ever
;
and
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
who
began
to
despair
of
success
,
would
have
departed
on
the
fifth
day
,
if
Topcliffe
had
not
prevented
him
.
<EOS>
"I
am
certain
they
are
here
,
"
said
the
latter
,
"
and
have
hit
upon
a
plan
which
can
not
fail
to
bring
them
forth
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
prisoners
meanwhile
suffered
grievously
from
their
confinement
,
and
hearing
the
searchers
knocking
against
the
walls
,
and
even
within
the
chimney
,
felt
certain
they
should
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
Not
being
able
to
stand
upright
,
or
to
stretch
themselves
within
the
cell
,
the
sitting
posture
they
were
compelled
to
adopt
became
,
after
a
time
,
intolerably
irksome
.
<EOS>
Broths
,
milk
,
wine
,
and
other
nutritious
fluids
,
were
conveyed
to
them
by
means
of
a
reed
from
the
adjoining
chimney
;
but
after
the
fifth
day
this
supply
was
stopped
,
as
Mrs.
Abingdon
and
Anne
Vaux
were
compelled
by
Topcliffe
to
remove
to
a
different
part
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
They
now
began
to
experience
all
the
horrors
of
starvation
,
and
debated
whether
they
should
die
where
they
were
,
or
yield
themselves
up
to
their
enemies
.
<EOS>
Wretched
as
their
condition
was
,
however
,
it
was
not
so
bad
as
that
of
their
domestics
,
Owen
and
Chambers
,
whose
wants
had
not
been
so
carefully
attended
to
,
and
who
were
now
reduced
to
the
most
deplorable
state
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
their
friends
less
uneasy
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
the
captives
,
whom
there
was
no
means
of
relieving
,
for
the
searchers
were
constantly
on
the
watch
,
could
not
hold
out
much
longer
,
Mrs.
Abingdon
consulted
with
her
husband
whether
it
would
not
be
better
to
reveal
their
hiding
-
places
;
but
this
he
would
not
permit
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
every
secret
chamber
,
vault
,
and
passage
in
the
place
,
except
the
actual
retreats
of
the
conspirators
,
had
been
discovered
by
Topcliffe
,
and
though
nothing
material
was
found
,
he
felt
assured
,
from
the
uneasiness
displayed
by
Mr.
Abingdon
and
his
wife
,
and
above
all
by
Anne
Vaux
,
that
it
could
not
be
long
before
his
perseverance
was
rewarded
.
<EOS>
Though
he
narrowly
watched
the
two
ladies
,
from
the
first
,
he
could
never
detect
them
in
the
act
of
conveying
food
to
the
captives
;
but
feeling
convinced
that
they
did
so
<EOS>
,
he
determined
to
remove
them
to
a
different
part
of
the
house
,
and
their
unwillingness
to
obey
the
order
confirmed
his
suspicions
.
<EOS>
"We
are
sure
of
our
prey
now
,
"
he
observed
to
Sir
Henry
Bromley
.
<EOS>
"
They
must
be
half
-
starved
by
this
time
,
and
will
speedily
surrender
themselves
.
<EOS>
""Pray
<EOS>
Heaven
<EOS>
they
do
so
!
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
wearied
to
death
with
my
long
stay
here
.
<EOS>
""Have
a
few
hours
'
patience
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Topcliffe
,
"
and
you
will
find
that
your
time
has
not
been
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
was
right
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
midnight
,
a
trooper
,
who
was
watching
in
the
gallery
,
beheld
two
spectral
-
looking
figures
approach
him
,
and
appalled
by
their
ghastly
appearance
,
uttered
a
loud
cry
.
<EOS>
This
brought
Topcliffe
,
who
was
in
the
hall
below
,
<EOS>
to
his
aid
,
and
instantly
perceiving
what
was
the
matter
,
he
ran
towards
the
supposed
phantoms
,
and
seized
them
.
<EOS>
The
poor
wretches
,
who
were
no
other
than
Owen
and
Chambers
,
and
were
well
-
nigh
famished
,
offered
no
resistance
,
but
would
neither
confess
where
they
had
been
hidden
,
nor
who
they
were
.
<EOS>
As
the
trooper
had
not
seen
them
come
forth
,
though
he
affirmed
with
a
tremendous
oath
that
they
had
issued
from
the
floor
,
the
walls
were
again
sounded
,
but
with
no
result
.
<EOS>
Food
being
placed
before
the
captives
,
they
devoured
it
voraciously
;
but
Topcliffe
forbore
to
question
them
further
that
night
,
feeling
confident
that
he
could
extract
the
truth
from
them
on
the
morrow
,
either
by
promises
or
threats
.
<EOS>
He
was
however
,
mistaken
.
<EOS>
They
continued
as
obstinate
as
before
,
and
when
confronted
with
Mr.
Abingdon
,
denied
all
knowledge
of
him
:
neither
would
they
explain
how
they
got
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
however
,
now
considered
himself
justified
in
placing
Mr.
Abingdon
and
his
lady
under
arrest
,
and
Topcliffe
redoubled
his
exertions
to
discover
the
hiding
-
place
of
the
two
priests
.
<EOS>
He
examined
every
part
of
the
gallery
most
carefully,—took
down
one
of
the
chimney
-
pieces
,
(
singularly
enough
,
it
was
the
wrong
one
,
)
but
was
still
unable
to
discover
their
retreat
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
poor
wretches
inside
found
it
impossible
to
endure
their
condition
longer
.
<EOS>
Anything
seemed
preferable
to
the
lingering
and
agonizing
death
they
were
now
enduring
,
and
they
resolved
to
delay
their
surrender
no
longer
.
<EOS>
Had
they
been
able
to
hold
out
a
few
hours
more
,
they
would
have
escaped
;
for
Sir
Henry
Bromley
was
so
fatigued
with
the
search
,
and
so
satisfied
that
nothing
further
would
come
of
it
,
that
he
resolved
,
notwithstanding
Topcliffe
's
efforts
to
dissuade
him
,
to
depart
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Of
this
they
were
ignorant
,
and
having
come
to
the
determination
to
surrender
,
Garnet
opened
the
entrance
to
the
chimney
,
and
hearing
voices
below
,
and
being
too
feeble
to
get
out
unassisted
,
he
called
to
the
speakers
for
aid
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
so
hollow
,
and
had
such
a
sepulchral
sound
,
<EOS>
that
those
who
heard
it
stared
at
each
other
in
astonishment
and
affright
.
<EOS>
"Who
calls
?
"
cried
one
of
the
troopers
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"One
of
those
you
seek
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
Come
and
help
us
forth
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
hearing
this
,
and
ascertaining
whence
the
voice
came
from
,
one
of
the
men
ran
to
fetch
Sir
Henry
Bromley
and
Topcliffe
,
both
of
whom
joyfully
obeyed
the
summons
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
possible
<EOS>
they
can
be
in
the
chimney
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
myself
have
examined
it
twice
.
<EOS>
""We
are
here
,
nevertheless
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
who
heard
the
remark
;
"
and
if
you
would
take
us
alive
,
lose
no
time
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
hint
was
not
lost
upon
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
Casting
a
triumphant
look
at
Bromley
,
he
seized
a
torch
from
one
of
his
attendants
,
and
getting
into
the
chimney
,
soon
perceived
the
entrance
to
the
recess
.
<EOS>
On
beholding
his
prey
,
he
uttered
an
exclamation
of
joy
,
and
the
two
miserable
captives
,
seeing
the
savage
and
exulting
grin
that
lighted
up
his
features
,
half
repented
the
step
they
had
taken
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
,
however
,
too
late
,
and
Garnet
begged
him
to
help
them
out
.
<EOS>
"That
I
will
readily
do
,
father
,
"
replied
Topcliffe
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
given
us
a
world
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
made
ample
amends
for
it
now
.
<EOS>
""Had
we
been
so
minded
,
you
would
never
have
found
us
,
"
rejoined
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
cell
would
have
been
our
sepulchre
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
doubt
,
"
retorted
Topcliffe
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
a
death
on
the
scaffold
is
preferable
to
the
horrors
of
starvation
.
<EOS>
"Finding
<EOS>
it
impossible
to
remove
Garnet
,
whose
limbs
were
so
cramped
that
they
refused
their
office
,
he
called
to
the
troopers
below
to
bring
a
ladder
,
which
was
placed
in
the
chimney
,
and
then
,
with
some
exertion
,
he
succeeded
in
getting
him
down
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
supported
him
towards
Sir
Henry
Bromley
,
who
was
standing
near
a
small
table
in
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
Illustration"I
told
you
your
time
would
not
be
thrown
away
,
Sir
Henry
,
"
he
observed
;
"
here
is
Father
Garnet
.
<EOS>
It
is
well
you
yielded
yourself
to
-
night
,
father
,
"
he
added
,
to
Garnet
,
with
his
customary
cynical
chuckle
;
"
for
Sir
Henry
had
resolved
to
depart
to
-
morrow
.
""Indeed
!
"
groaned
Garnet
.
"
<EOS>
Help
me
to
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
this
was
passing
,
Oldcorne
was
brought
down
by
two
of
the
troopers
,
and
the
unfortunate
priests
were
conveyed
to
an
adjoining
chamber
,
where
they
were
placed
in
a
bed
,
their
stiffened
limbs
chafed
,
and
cordials
administered
to
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
reduced
,
however
,
to
such
extremity
of
weakness
,
that
it
was
not
judged
prudent
to
remove
them
till
the
third
day
,
when
they
,
together
with
their
two
servants
,
Owen
and
Chambers
,
who
were
as
much
enfeebled
as
themselves
,
were
conveyed
to
Worcester

WHITEHALLSuch
was
the
expedition
used
by
Humphrey
Chetham
and
Viviana
,
that
they
accomplished
the
journey
to
London
in
an
extraordinarily
short
space
of
time
.
<EOS>
Proceeding
direct
to
Whitehall
,
Viviana
placed
a
letter
in
the
hands
of
a
halberdier
,
and
desired
that
it
might
be
given
without
delay
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
After
some
demur
,
the
man
handed
it
to
an
usher
,
who
promised
to
lay
it
before
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
Some
time
elapsed
before
the
result
of
its
reception
was
known
,
when
an
officer
,
accompanied
by
two
sergeants
of
the
guard
,
made
his
appearance
,
and
commanded
Viviana
and
her
companion
to
follow
him
.
<EOS>
Crossing
a
wide
hall
,
which
was
filled
with
the
various
retainers
of
the
palace
,
who
regarded
them
with
a
sort
of
listless
curiosity
,
and
ascending
a
flight
of
marble
steps
,
they
traversed
a
long
corridor
,
and
were
at
length
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
at
a
table
,
covered
with
a
multitude
of
papers
,
and
was
busily
employed
in
writing
a
despatch
,
but
immediately
stopped
on
their
entrance
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
alone
.
<EOS>
His
companion
was
a
middle
-
aged
man
,
attired
in
a
suit
of
black
velvet
,
with
a
cloak
of
the
same
material
;
but
as
he
sat
with
his
back
towards
the
door
,
it
was
impossible
to
discern
his
features
.
<EOS>
"You
may
leave
us
,
"
said
Salisbury
to
the
officer
,
"
but
remain
without
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
be
ready
to
enter
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
"
added
his
companion
,
without
altering
his
position
.
<EOS>
The
officer
bowed
,
and
retired
with
his
followers
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
surrender
of
yourself
at
this
time
,
Viviana
Radcliffe
,
"
said
the
Earl
,
"
weighs
much
in
your
favour
;
and
if
you
are
disposed
freely
to
declare
all
you
know
of
the
conspiracy
,
it
is
not
impossible
that
the
King
may
extend
his
mercy
towards
you
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
not
desire
it
,
my
lord
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
In
surrendering
myself
,
I
have
no
other
aim
than
to
satisfy
the
laws
I
have
outraged
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
seek
to
defend
myself
,
but
I
desire
to
offer
an
explanation
to
your
lordship
.
<EOS>
Circumstances
,
which
it
is
needless
to
detail
,
drew
me
into
connexion
with
the
conspirators
,
and
I
became
unwillingly
the
depositary
of
their
dark
design
.
<EOS>
""You
were
guilty
of
misprision
of
treason
in
not
revealing
it
,
"
remarked
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"I
am
aware
of
it
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
but
this
,
I
take
heaven
to
witness
,
is
the
extent
of
my
criminality
.
<EOS>
I
held
the
project
in
the
utmost
abhorrence
,
and
used
every
argument
I
was
mistress
of
to
induce
its
contrivers
to
abandon
it
.
<EOS>
""If
such
were
the
case
,
"
demanded
the
Earl
,
"
what
withheld
you
from
disclosing
it?""I
will
now
confess
what
torture
could
not
wring
from
me
before
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
restrained
from
the
disclosure
by
a
fatal
passion
.
<EOS>
""I
suspected
as
much
,
"
observed
the
Earl
,
with
a
sneer
.
"
<EOS>
For
whom?""For
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"God
's
mercy
!
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
!
"
ejaculated
the
Earl
's
companion
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
And
turning
as
he
spoke
,
and
facing
her
,
he
disclosed
heavy
but
not
unintellectual
features
,
now
charged
with
an
expression
of
the
utmost
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Did
you
say
Guy
Fawkes
,
mistress?""It
is
the
King
,
"
whispered
Humphrey
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"Since
<EOS>
I
know
in
whose
presence
I
stand
,
sire
,
"
replied
Viviana
,
"
I
will
answer
the
interrogation
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
the
cause
of
<EOS>
my
concealing
my
acquaintance
with
the
plot
.
<EOS>
And
more
,
I
will
confess
to
your
Majesty
,
that
much
as
I
abhor
the
design
,
if
he
had
not
been
a
conspirator
,
I
should
never
have
loved
him
.
<EOS>
His
sombre
and
enthusiastic
character
first
gave
him
an
interest
in
my
eyes
,
which
,
heightened
by
several
important
services
which
he
rendered
me
,
soon
ripened
into
love
.
<EOS>
Linked
to
his
fortunes
,
shrouded
by
the
same
gloomy
cloud
that
enveloped
him
,
and
bound
by
a
chain
from
which
I
could
not
extricate
myself
,
I
gave
him
my
hand
.
<EOS>
But
the
moment
of
our
union
was
the
moment
of
our
separation
.
<EOS>
We
have
not
met
since
,
and
shall
meet
no
more
,
unless
to
part
for
ever
.
<EOS>
""A
strange
history
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
James
,
in
a
tone
that
showed
he
was
not
unmoved
by
the
relation
.
<EOS>
"I
beseech
your
Majesty
to
grant
me
one
boon
,
"
cried
Viviana
,
falling
at
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
to
be
allowed
a
single
interview
with
my
husband
—
not
for
the
sad
gratification
of
beholding
him
again
—
not
for
the
indulgence
of
my
private
sorrows
—
but
that
I
may
endeavour
to
awaken
a
feeling
of
repentance
in
his
breast
,
and
be
the
means
of
saving
his
soul
alive
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
inclinations
prompt
me
to
grant
the
request
,
Salisbury
,
"
said
the
King
,
irresolutely
.
<EOS>
"
There
can
be
no
risk
in
doing
it
—
eh?""Not
under
certain
restrictions
,
my
liege
,
"
replied
the
Earl
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
have
your
wish
,
then
,
mistress
,
"
said
James
,
"
and
I
trust
your
efforts
may
be
crowned
with
success
.
<EOS>
Your
husband
is
a
hardy
traitor
—
a
second
Jacques
Clement
—
and
we
never
think
of
him
without
the
floor
shaking
beneath
our
feet
,
and
a
horrible
smell
of
gunpowder
assailing
our
nostrils
.
<EOS>
Blessed
be
God
for
our
preservation
!
<EOS>
But
whom
have
we
here
?
"
he
added
,
turning
to
Humphrey
Chetham
.
"
<EOS>
Another
conspirator
come
to
surrender
himself?""No
,
my
liege
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Chetham
;
"
I
am
a
loyal
subject
of
your
Majesty
,
and
a
stanch
Protestant
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
we
may
take
your
word
for
it
,
doubtless
,
"
replied
the
King
,
with
an
incredulous
look
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
how
come
you
in
this
lady
's
company?""I
will
hide
nothing
from
your
Majesty
,
"
replied
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
Long
before
Viviana
's
unhappy
acquaintance
with
Fawkes
—
for
such
<EOS>
I
must
ever
consider
it
—
my
affections
had
been
fixed
upon
her
,
and
I
fondly
trusted
she
would
not
prove
indifferent
to
my
suit
.
<EOS>
Even
now
,
sire
,
when
all
hope
is
dead
within
me
,
I
have
not
been
able
to
overcome
my
passion
,
but
love
her
as
devotedly
as
ever
.
<EOS>
When
,
therefore
,
she
desired
my
escort
to
London
to
surrender
herself
,
I
could
not
refuse
the
request
.
<EOS>
""It
is
the
truth
,
my
liege
,
"
added
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
I
owe
Humphrey
Chetham
(
for
so
this
gentleman
is
named
)
an
endless
debt
of
gratitude
;
and
not
the
least
of
my
present
distresses
is
the
thought
of
the
affliction
I
have
occasioned
him
.
<EOS>
""Dismiss
it
from
your
mind
<EOS>
,
then
,
Viviana
,
"
rejoined
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
It
will
not
mitigate
my
sorrows
to
feel
that
I
have
added
to
yours
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
manner
and
looks
seem
to
give
a
warranty
for
loyalty
,
young
sir
,
"
said
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
have
some
assurance
of
the
truth
of
your
statement
before
you
are
set
at
large
.
<EOS>
""I
am
your
willing
prisoner
,
my
liege
,
"
returned
Chetham
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
a
letter
for
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
which
may
vouch
perhaps
for
me
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
spoke
,
he
placed
a
letter
in
the
Earl
's
hands
,
who
broke
open
the
seal
,
and
hastily
glanced
at
its
contents
.
<EOS>
"It
is
from
Doctor
Dee
,
"
he
said
,
"
from
whom
,
as
your
Majesty
is
aware
,
we
have
received
much
important
information
relative
to
this
atrocious
design
.
<EOS>
He
answers
for
this
young
man
's
loyalty
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
rejoined
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
have
been
mortifying
to
be
deceived
by
so
honest
a
physiognomy
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
Majesty
will
be
pleased
to
attach
your
signature
to
this
warrant
for
Viviana
Radcliffe
's
committal
to
the
Tower
,
"
said
Salisbury
,
placing
a
paper
before
him
.
<EOS>
James
complied
,
and
the
Earl
summoned
the
guard
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
I
your
Majesty
's
permission
to
attend
this
unfortunate
lady
to
the
fortress
?
"
cried
Chetham
,
prostrating
himself
before
the
King
.
<EOS>
James
hesitated
,
but
glancing
at
the
Earl
,
and
reading
no
objection
in
his
looks
,
he
assented
.
<EOS>
Whispering
some
private
instructions
to
the
officer
respecting
Chetham
,
Salisbury
delivered
the
warrant
to
him
.
<EOS>
Viviana
and
her
companion
were
then
removed
to
a
small
chamber
adjoining
the
guard
-
room
,
where
they
remained
for
nearly
an
hour
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
the
officer
again
appeared
,
and
conducted
them
to
the
palace
-
stairs
,
where
a
large
wherry
awaited
them
,
in
which
they
embarked
.
<EOS>
James
did
not
remain
long
with
his
councillor
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
retired
,
Salisbury
summoned
a
confidential
attendant
,
and
told
him
to
acquaint
Lord
Mounteagle
,
who
was
in
an
adjoining
apartment
,
that
he
was
now
able
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
The
attendant
departed
,
and
presently
returned
with
the
nobleman
in
question
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
and
Salisbury
had
satisfied
himself
they
could
not
be
overheard
,
he
observed
to
the
other,"Since
Tresham
's
committal
to
the
Tower
yesterday
,
I
have
received
a
letter
from
the
lieutenant
,
stating
that
he
breathes
nothing
but
revenge
against
yourself
and
me
,
and
threatens
to
betray
us
,
if
he
is
not
released
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
do
to
let
him
be
examined
by
the
Council
;
for
though
we
can
throw
utter
discredit
on
his
statement
,
it
may
be
prejudicial
to
my
future
designs
.
<EOS>
""True
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
But
how
do
you
propose
to
silence
him?""By
poison
,
"
returned
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
trusty
fellow
in
the
Tower
,
a
jailer
named
Ipgreve
,
who
will
administer
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
powder
,
"
he
added
,
unlocking
a
coffer
,
and
taking
out
a
small
packet
;
"
it
was
given
me
by
its
compounder
,
Doctor
Dee
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
same
,
I
am
assured
,
as
the
celebrated
Italian
poison
prepared
by
Pope
Alexander
the
Sixth
;
is
without
scent
or
taste
;
and
destroys
its
victim
without
leaving
a
trace
of
its
effects
.
<EOS>
""I
must
take
heed
how
I
offend
your
lordship
,
"
observed
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"Nay
,
"
rejoined
Salisbury
,
with
a
ghastly
smile
,
"
<EOS>
it
is
for
traitors
like
Tresham
,
not
true
men
like
you
,
to
fear
me
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
the
distinction
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"I
must
intrust
the
entire
management
of
this
affair
to
you
,
"
pursued
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
"To
me
!
"
exclaimed
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"
Tresham
is
my
brother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
I
can
take
no
part
in
his
murder
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
he
lives
,
you
are
ruined
,
"
rejoined
Salisbury
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
sacrifice
him
or
yourself
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
are
reasonable
.
<EOS>
Take
this
powder
,
and
proceed
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
See
Ipgreve
alone
,
and
instruct
him
to
drug

THE
PARTING
OF
VIVIANA
AND
HUMPHREY
CHETHAMHumphrey
Chetham
was
so
oppressed
by
the
idea
of
parting
with
Viviana
,
that
he
did
not
utter
a
single
word
during
their
transit
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
Passing
beneath
the
gloomy
archway
of
Traitors
'
Gate
,
they
mounted
the
fatal
steps
,
and
were
conducted
to
the
guard
-
room
near
the
By
-
ward
Tower
.
<EOS>
The
officer
then
despatched
one
of
the
warders
to
inform
the
lieutenant
of
Viviana
's
arrival
,
and
telling
Humphrey
Chetham
he
would
allow
him
a
few
minutes
to
take
leave
of
her
,
considerately
withdrew
,
and
left
them
alone
together
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
Viviana
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Chetham
,
unable
to
repress
his
grief
,
"
my
heart
bleeds
to
see
you
here
.
<EOS>
If
you
repent
the
step
you
have
taken
,
and
desire
freedom
,
say
so
,
and
I
will
use
every
effort
to
liberate
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
successful
once
,
and
may
be
so
again
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
for
your
devotion
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
tone
of
profound
gratitude
;
"
but
you
have
rendered
me
the
last
service
I
shall
ever
require
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
deeply
deplore
the
misery
I
have
occasioned
you
,
and
regret
my
inability
to
requite
your
attachment
as
it
deserves
to
be
requited
.
<EOS>
My
last
prayers
shall
be
for
your
happiness
;
and
I
trust
you
will
meet
with
some
being
worthy
of
you
,
and
who
will
make
amends
for
my
insensibility
.
<EOS>
""Be
not
deceived
,
Viviana
,
"
replied
Chetham
,
in
a
broken
voice
;
"
I
shall
never
love
again
.
<EOS>
Your
image
is
too
deeply
imprinted
upon
my
heart
ever
to
be
effaced
.
<EOS>
""Time
may
work
a
change
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
though
I
ought
not
to
say
so
,
for
I
feel
it
would
work
none
in
me
.
<EOS>
Suffer
me
to
give
you
one
piece
of
counsel
.
<EOS>
Devote
yourself
resolutely
to
the
business
of
life
,
and
you
will
speedily
regain
your
peace
of
mind
.
<EOS>
""I
will
follow
your
instructions
implicitly
,
"
replied
Chetham
;
"
but
have
little
hope
of
the
result
you
promise
me
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
the
effort
be
made
,
"
she
rejoined;—"and
now
promise
me
to
quit
London
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Return
to
your
native
town
,
employ
yourself
in
your
former
occupations
;
and
strive
not
to
think
of
the
past
,
except
as
a
troubled
dream
from
which
you
have
fortunately
awakened
.
<EOS>
Do
not
let
us
prolong
our
parting
,
or
your
resolution
may
waver
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"So
saying
,
she
extended
her
hand
towards
him
,
and
he
pressed
it
passionately
to
his
lips
.
"Farewell
,
Viviana
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
with
a
look
of
unutterable
anguish
.
"
<EOS>
May
Heaven
support
you
in
your
trials!""One
of
them
I
am
now
enduring
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
"
<EOS>
Farewell
for
ever
,
and
may
all
good
angels
bless
you!"At
this
moment
,
the
officer
appeared
,
and
announcing
the
approach
of
the
lieutenant
,
told
Chetham
that
his
time
had
expired
.
<EOS>
Without
hazarding
another
look
at
Viviana
,
the
young
merchant
tore
himself
away
,
and
followed
the
officer
out
of
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
Obedient
to
Viviana
's
last
request
,
he
quitted
London
on
the
following
day
,
and
acting
upon
her
advice
,
devoted
himself
on
his
return
to
Manchester
sedulously
to
his
mercantile
pursuits
.
<EOS>
His
perseverance
and
integrity
were
crowned
with
entire
success
,
and
he
became
in
due
season
the
wealthiest
merchant
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
But
the
blighting
of
his
early
affections
tinged
his
whole
life
,
and
gave
a
melancholy
to
his
thoughts
and
an
austerity
to
his
manner
originally
foreign
to
them
.
<EOS>
True
to
his
promise
,
he
died
unmarried
.
<EOS>
His
long
and
worthy
career
was
marked
by
actions
of
the
greatest
benevolence
.
<EOS>
In
proportion
as
his
means
increased
,
his
charities
were
extended
,
and
he
truly
became
"
a
father
to
the
fatherless
and
the
destitute
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
him
the
town
of
Manchester
is
indebted
for
the
noble
library
and
hospital
bearing
his
name
;
and
for
these
admirable
institutions
by
which
they
so
largely
benefit
,
his
memory
must
ever
be
held
in
veneration
by
its
inhabitants

—
THE
SUBTERRANEAN
DUNGEONRegarding
Viviana
with
a
smile
of
savage
satisfaction
,
Sir
William
Waad
commanded
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
who
accompanied
him
,
to
convey
her
to
one
of
the
subterranean
dungeons
below
the
Devereux
Tower
.
"She
<EOS>
can
not
escape
thence
without
your
connivance
,
"
he
said
;
"
<EOS>
and
you
shall
answer
to
me
for
her
safe
custody
with
your
life
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
she
escapes
again
,
your
worship
shall
hang
me
in
her
stead
,
"
rejoined
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
instructions
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
state
that
it
is
the
King
's
pleasure
that
she
be
allowed
a
short
interview
with
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
said
the
lieutenant
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
Let
her
be
taken
to
his
cell
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
jailer
bowed
,
and
motioning
the
guard
to
follow
him
with
Viviana
,
he
led
the
way
along
the
inner
ward
till
he
arrived
at
a
small
strong
door
in
the
wall
a
little
to
the
north
of
the
Beauchamp
Tower
,
which
he
unlocked
,
and
descended
into
a
low
cavernous
-
looking
vault
.
<EOS>
Striking
a
light
,
and
setting
fire
to
a
torch
,
he
then
led
the
way
along
a
narrow
gloomy
passage
,
which
brought
them
to
a
circular
chamber
,
from
which
other
passages
diverged
,
and
selecting
one
of
them
,
threaded
it
till
he
came
to
the
door
of
a
cell
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
your
dungeon
,
"
he
said
to
Viviana
,
as
he
drew
back
the
heavy
bolts
,
and
disclosed
a
small
chamber
,
about
four
feet
wide
and
six
long
,
in
which
there
was
a
pallet
.
<EOS>
"
My
dame
will
attend
you
soon
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
lighted
a
lamp
,
and
departing
with
the
guard
,
barred
the
door
outside
.
<EOS>
Viviana
shuddered
as
she
surveyed
the
narrow
dungeon
in
which
she
was
placed
.
<EOS>
Roof
,
walls
,
and
floor
were
of
stone
;
and
the
aspect
of
the
place
was
so
dismal
and
tomb
-
like
,
that
she
felt
as
if
she
were
buried
alive
.
<EOS>
Some
hours
elapsed
before
Dame
Ipgreve
made
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
was
accompanied
by
Ruth
,
who
burst
into
tears
on
beholding
Viviana
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
's
wife
had
brought
a
few
blankets
and
other
necessaries
with
her
,
together
with
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
water
.
<EOS>
While
disposing
the
blankets
on
the
couch
,
she
never
ceased
upbraiding
Viviana
for
her
former
flight
.
<EOS>
Poor
Ruth
,
who
was
compelled
to
assist
her
mother
,
endeavoured
by
her
gestures
and
looks
to
convey
to
the
unfortunate
captive
that
she
was
as
much
devoted
to
her
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Their
task
completed
,
the
old
woman
withdrew
,
and
<EOS>
her
daughter
,
casting
a
deeply
-
commiserating
look
at
Viviana
,
followed
her
,
and
the
door
was
barred
without
.
<EOS>
Determined
not
to
yield
to
despondency
,
Viviana
knelt
down
,
and
addressed
herself
to
Heaven
;
and
,
comforted
by
her
prayers
,
threw
herself
on
the
bed
,
and
sank
into
a
peaceful
slumber
.
<EOS>
She
was
awakened
by
hearing
the
bolts
of
her
cell
withdrawn
,
and
the
next
moment
Ruth
stood
before
her
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
fear
you
have
exposed
yourself
to
great
risk
in
thus
visiting
me
,
"
said
Viviana
,
tenderly
embracing
her
.
<EOS>
"I
would
expose
myself
to
any
risk
for
you
,
sweet
lady
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
,
oh
!
<EOS>
why
do
I
see
you
here
again
?
<EOS>
The
chief
support
of
Guy
Fawkes
during
his
sufferings
has
been
the
thought
that
you
were
at
liberty
.
<EOS>
""I
surrendered
myself
in
the
hope
of
beholding
him
again
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
given
a
fond
,
but
fatal
proof
of
your
affection
,
"
returned
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
The
knowledge
that
you
are
a
captive
will
afflict
him
more
than
all
the
torments
he
has
endured
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
torments
has
he
endured
,
Ruth
?
"
inquired
Viviana
with
a
look
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
"Do
not
ask
me
to
repeat
them
,
"
replied
the
jailer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
They
are
too
dreadful
to
relate
.
<EOS>
When
you
behold
his
shattered
frame
and
altered
looks
,
you
will
comprehend
what
he
has
undergone
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Viviana
,
bursting
into
tears
,
"
I
almost
fear
to
behold
him
.
<EOS>
""You
must
prepare
for
a
fearful
shock
,
"
returned
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
,
madam
,
I
must
take
my
leave
.
<EOS>
I
will
endeavour
to
see
you
again
to
-
morrow
,
but
dare
not
promise
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
been
able
to
visit
you
now
,
but
that
my
father
is
engaged
with
Lord
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
""With
<EOS>
Lord
Mounteagle
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
what
business?"Upon
a
foul
business
,
"
rejoined
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
less
than
the
destruction
of
Mr.
Tresham
,
who
is
now
a
prisoner
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
Lord
Mounteagle
came
to
the
Well
Tower
this
evening
,
and
I
accidentally
overheard
him
propose
to
my
father
to
administer
poison
to
the
person
I
have
named
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
pity
their
victim
,
"
returned
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
double
-
dyed
traitor
,
and
will
meet
with
the
fate
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
""Farewell
,
madam
,
"
said
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
do
not
see
you
again
,
you
will
know
that
you
have
one
friend
in
this
fortress
who
deeply
sympathizes
with
your
afflictions
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
she
withdrew
,
and
Viviana
heard
the
bolts
slipped
gently
into
their
sockets
.
<EOS>
Vainly
,
after
Ruth
's
visit
,
did
she
try
to
compose
herself
.
<EOS>
Sleep
fled
her
eyes
,
and
she
was
haunted
all
night
by
the
image
of
Fawkes
,
haggard
and
shattered
by
torture
,
as
he
had
been
described
by
the
jailer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Day
and
night
were
the
same
to
her
,
and
she
could
only
compute
progress
of
the
time
by
her
own
feelings
,
judging
by
which
,
she
supposed
it
to
be
late
in
the
day
when
she
was
again
visited
.
<EOS>
The
bolts
of
her
cell
being
withdrawn
,
two
men
clad
in
long
black
gowns
,
and
having
hoods
drawn
over
their
faces
,
entered
it
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
Ipgreve
;
and
Viviana
,
concluding
she
was
about
to
be
led
to
the
torture
,
endeavoured
to
string
herself
to
its
endurance
.
<EOS>
Though
he
guessed
what
was
passing
in
her
breast
,
Jasper
Ipgreve
did
not
care
to
undeceive
her
,
but
motioning
the
hooded
officials
to
follow
him
with
her
,
quitted
the
cell
.
<EOS>
Seizing
each
a
hand
,
the
attendants
led
her
after
him
along
a
number
of
intricate
passages
,
until
he
stopped
before
the
door
of
a
cell
,
which
he
opened
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
brief
in
what
you
have
to
say
,
"
he
cried
,
thrusting
her
forward
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
allow
you
much
time
.
<EOS>
"Viviana
<EOS>
no
sooner
set
foot
in
the
cell
than
she
felt
in
whose
presence
she
stood
.
<EOS>
On
a
stool
at
the
further
end
of
the
narrow
chamber
,
with
his
head
upon
his
breast
,
and
a
cloak
wrapped
around
his
limbs
,
sat
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
A
small
iron
lamp
,
suspended
by
a
rusty
chain
from
the
ceiling
,
served
to
illumine
his
ghastly
features
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
his
eyes
from
the
ground
on
her
entrance
,
and
recognising
her
,
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
Raising
himself
by
a
great
effort
,
he
opened
his
arms
,
and
she
rushed
into
them
.
<EOS>
For
some
moments
,
both
continued
silent
.
<EOS>
Grief
took
away
their
utterance
;
but
at
length
,
Guy
Fawkes
spoke
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
cup
of
bitterness
was
not
sufficiently
full
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
This
alone
was
wanting
to
make
it
overflow
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
you
will
blame
me
,
"
she
replied
,
"
when
you
learn
that
I
have
voluntarily
surrendered
myself
.
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
uttered
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
"I
am
the
cause
of
<EOS>
your
doing
so
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"You
are
so
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
will
forgive
me
when
you
know
my
motive
.
<EOS>
I
came
here
to
urge
you
to
repentance
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
if
you
hope
that
we
shall
meet
again
hereafter
—
if
you
hope
that
we
shall
inherit
joys
which
will
requite
us
for
all
our
troubles
,
you
will
employ
the
brief
time
left
you
on
earth
in
imploring
forgiveness
for
your
evil
intentions
.
<EOS>
""Having
<EOS>
had
no
evil
intentions
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
coldly
,
"
I
have
no
pardon
to
ask
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Tempter
who
led
you
into
the
commission
of
sin
under
the
semblance
of
righteousness
,
puts
these
thoughts
into
your
heart
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
escaped
the
commission
of
an
offence
which
must
have
deprived
you
of
the
joys
of
heaven
,
and
I
am
thankful
for
it
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
remain
impenitent
,
I
shall
tremble
for
your
salvation
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
account
will
soon
be
settled
with
my
Maker
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
;
"
and
he
will
punish
or
reward
me
according
to
my
deserts
.
<EOS>
I
have
acted
according
to
my
conscience
,
and
can
never
repent
that
which
I
believe
to
be
a
righteous
design
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
do
you
not
now
see
that
you
were
mistaken
,
"
returned
Viviana,—"do
<EOS>
you
not
perceive
that
the
sword
which
you
raised
against
others
has
been
turned
against
yourself,—and
that
the
Great
Power
whom
you
serve
and
worship
has
declared
himself
against
you?""You
seek
in
vain
to
move
me
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
as
insensible
to
your
arguments
as
to
the
tortures
of
my
enemies
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
Heaven
have
mercy
upon
your
soul
!
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Look
at
me
,
Viviana
,
"
cried
Fawkes
,
"
and
behold
the
wreck
I
am
.
<EOS>
What
has
supported
me
amid
my
tortures
—
in
this
dungeon
—
in
the
presence
of
my
relentless
foes?—what
,
but
the
consciousness
of
having
acted
rightly
?
<EOS>
And
what
will
support
me
on
the
scaffold
except
the
same
conviction
?
<EOS>
If
you
love
me
,
do
not
seek
to
shake
my
faith
!
<EOS>
But
it
is
idle
to
talk
thus
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
do
so
.
<EOS>
Rest
satisfied
we
shall
meet
again
.
<EOS>
Everything
assures
me
of
it
.
<EOS>
Wretched
as
I
appear
in
this
solitary
cell
,
I
am
not
wholly
miserable
,
because
I
am
buoyed
up
by
the
certainty
that
my
actions
are
approved
by
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
attempt
to
destroy
the
delusion
,
since
it
is
productive
of
happiness
to
you
,
"
replied
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
But
if
my
earnest
,
heartfelt
prayers
can
conduce
to
your
salvation
,
they
shall
not
be
wanting
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
she
spoke
,
the
door
of
the
cell
was
opened
by
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
who
stepped
towards
her
,
and
seized
her
roughly
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"Your
time
has
expired
,
mistress
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
must
come
with
me
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
minute
longer
,
"
implored
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
a
second
,
"
replied
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"Shall
<EOS>
we
not
meet
again
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
the
day
before
your
execution
,
"
rejoined
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
good
news
for
you
,
"
he
added
,
pausing
for
a
moment
,
and
addressing
Fawkes
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Tresham
,
who
I
told
you
has
been
brought
to
the
Tower
,
has
been
taken
suddenly
and
dangerously
ill
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
the
traitor
perishes
before
me
<EOS>
,
I
shall
die
content
,
"
observed
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Then
rest
assured
of
it
,
"
said
Viviana
.
<EOS>
"
The
task
of
vengeance
is
already
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
"She
was
then
forced
away
by
Ipgreve
,
and
delivered
by
him
to
the
hooded
officials
outside
,
who
hurried
her
back
to
her
dungeon

THE
TRAITOR
BETRAYEDLord
Mounteagle
arrived
at
the
Tower
shortly
after
Viviana
,
and
repairing
at
once
to
the
lieutenant
's
lodgings
,
had
a
brief
conference
with
him
,
and
informed
him
that
he
had
a
secret
order
to
deliver
to
Jasper
Ipgreve
,
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
touching
the
conspirators
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Waad
would
have
summoned
the
jailer
;
but
Mounteagle
preferred
visiting
him
at
the
Well
Tower
,
and
accordingly
proceeded
thither
.
<EOS>
He
found
Ipgreve
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
and
telling
him
he
desired
a
moment
's
private
speech
with
him
,
the
jailer
dismissed
them
.
<EOS>
Suspecting
that
the
new
-
comer
's
errand
related
in
some
way
to
Viviana
,
Ruth
contrived
to
place
herself
in
such
a
situation
that
she
could
overhear
what
passed
.
<EOS>
A
moment
's
scrutiny
of
Jasper
's
villanous
countenance
satisfied
Mounteagle
that
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
was
not
mistaken
in
his
man
;
and
,
as
soon
as
he
supposed
they
were
alone
<EOS>
,
he
unhesitatingly
opened
his
plan
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
he
expected
,
Jasper
exhibited
no
reluctance
to
undertake
it
;
and
,
after
some
further
discussion
,
it
was
agreed
to
put
it
in
execution
without
delay
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sooner
Mr.
Tresham
is
silenced
the
better
,
"
said
Jasper
;
"
for
he
threatens
to
make
disclosures
to
the
Council
that
will
bring
some
noble
persons
,
"
with
a
significant
look
at
Mounteagle
,
"
into
trouble
.
<EOS>
""Where
<EOS>
is
he
confined
?
"
demanded
the
other
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
the
Beauchamp
Tower
,
"
replied
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"I
will
visit
him
at
once
,
"
said
Mounteagle
;
"
and
when
I
have
conferred
with
him
,
will
call
for
wine
.
<EOS>
Bring
two
goblets
,
and
in
that
which
you
give
to
Tresham
place
this
powder
.
<EOS>
"Ipgreve
<EOS>
nodded
assent
,
and
with
a
grim
smile
took
the
packet
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
they
quitted
the
Well
Tower
together
,
and
passing
under
the
archway
of
the
Bloody
Tower
,
crossed
the
green
,
and
entered
the
fortification
in
which
the
traitor
was
confined
.
<EOS>
Tresham
was
treated
with
far
greater
consideration
than
the
other
conspirators
,
being
allowed
the
use
of
the
large
room
on
the
upper
floor
of
the
Beauchamp
Tower
,
which
was
seldom
allotted
to
any
persons
except
those
of
the
highest
distinction
.
<EOS>
When
they
entered
,
he
was
pacing
to
and
fro
within
his
chamber
in
great
agitation
;
but
he
immediately
stopped
on
seeing
Mounteagle
,
and
rushed
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"You
bring
me
my
liberation
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"It
is
impossible
to
effect
it
at
present
,
"
returned
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
But
make
yourself
perfectly
easy
.
<EOS>
Your
confinement
will
not
be
of
long
duration
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
be
trifled
with
,
"
cried
Tresham
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
am
examined
by
the
Council
,
look
to
yourselves
.
<EOS>
As
I
hope
for
salvation
,
the
truth
shall
out
.
<EOS>
""Leave
us
,
"
said
Mounteagle
,
with
a
significant
look
at
the
jailer
,
who
quitted
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
"Hark'e
,
Mounteagle
<EOS>
,
"
said
Tresham
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
"
I
have
been
your
tool
thus
far
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
propose
to
lead
me
blindfold
to
the
scaffold
,
you
are
greatly
mistaken
.
<EOS>
You
think
that
you
have
me
safe
within
these
walls
;
that
my
voice
can
not
be
heard
;
and
that
I
can
not
betray
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
deceived
—
fearfully
deceived
,
as
you
will
find
.
<EOS>
I
have
your
letters
—
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
letters
,
proving
that
you
were
both
aware
of
the
plot
—
and
that
you
employed
me
to
watch
its
progress
,
and
report
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
letters
from
Doctor
Dee
,
the
warden
of
Manchester
,
detailing
his
acquaintance
with
the
conspiracy
,
and
containing
descriptions
of
the
persons
of
Fawkes
and
Catesby
,
which
I
showed
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury.—These
letters
are
now
in
my
possession
,
and
I
will
deliver
them
to
the
Council
,
if
I
am
not
released
.
<EOS>
""Deliver
them
to
me
,
and
I
swear
to
you
,
you
shall
be
set
free
,
"
said
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
trust
you
,
"
rejoined
Tresham
.
"
<EOS>
Liberate
me
,
and
they
are
yours
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
not
rob
myself
of
vengeance
.
<EOS>
I
will
confound
you
and
the
false
Earl
of
Salisbury
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
wrong
us
both
by
your
unjust
suspicions
,
"
said
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"Wrong
you
!
"
echoed
Tresham
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
my
promised
reward
?
<EOS>
Why
am
I
in
this
dungeon
?
<EOS>
Why
am
I
treated
like
a
traitor
?
<EOS>
If
you
meant
me
fairly
,
I
should
not
be
here
,
but
like
yourself
at
liberty
,
and
in
the
enjoyment
of
the
King
's
favour
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
duped
me
,
villain
,
and
shall
rue
it
.
<EOS>
If
I
am
led
to
the
scaffold
,
it
shall
be
in
your
company
.
<EOS>
""Compose
<EOS>
yourself
,
"
rejoined
Mounteagle
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
Appearances
,
I
own
,
are
against
us
.
<EOS>
But
circumstances
render
it
imperatively
necessary
that
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
should
appear
to
act
against
you
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
charged
by
Guy
Fawkes
,
when
under
the
torture
,
of
being
a
confederate
in
the
design
,
and
your
arrest
could
not
be
avoided
.
<EOS>
I
am
come
hither
to
give
you
a
solemn
assurance
that
no
harm
shall
befal
you
,
but
that
you
shall
be
delivered
from
your
thraldom
in
a
few
days
—
perhaps
in
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
""You
have
no
further
design
against
me
,
"
said
Tresham
,
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"What
motive
<EOS>
could
I
have
in
coming
hither
,
except
to
set
your
mind
at
rest
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
shall
receive
my
reward
?
"
demanded
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"You
will
receive
your
reward
,
"
returned
Mounteagle
,
with
significant
emphasis
.
<EOS>
"
I
swear
it
.
<EOS>
So
make
yourself
easy
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
thought
I
might
trust
you
,
<EOS>
I
should
not
heed
my
imprisonment
,
irksome
though
it
be
,
"
rejoined
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"It
can
not
be
avoided
,
for
the
reasons
I
have
just
stated
,
"
replied
Mounteagle
.
"
<EOS>
But
come
,
no
more
despondency
.
<EOS>
All
will
be
well
with
you
speedily
.
<EOS>
Let
us
drown
care
in
a
bumper
.
<EOS>
What
ho
!
<EOS>
jailer
,
"
he
added
,
opening
the
door
,
"
a
cup
of
wine!"In
a
few
minutes
,
<EOS>
Ipgreve
made
his
appearance
,
bearing
two
goblets
filled
with
wine
on
a
salver
,
one
of
which
he
presented
to
Mounteagle
,
and
the
other
to
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
to
your
speedy
deliverance
from
captivity
!
"
<EOS>
said
Mounteagle
,
draining
the
goblet
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
not
refuse
that
pledge
,
Tresham?""Of
a
surety
not
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
To
my
speedy
deliverance!"And
he
emptied
the
cup
,
while
Mounteagle
and
the
jailer
exchanged
significant
glances
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
having
fully
discharged
my
errand
,
I
must
bid
you
farewell
,
"
said
Mounteagle
.
<EOS>
"You
will
not
forget
your
promise
?
"
<EOS>
observed
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"Assuredly
<EOS>
not
,
"
replied
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
A
week
hence
,
and
you
will
make
no
complaint
against
me.—Are
<EOS>
you
sure
you
did
not
give
me
the
wrong
goblet
?
<EOS>
"
he
added
to
Ipgreve
,
as
they
descended
the
spiral
staircase
.
"Quite
<EOS>
sure
,
my
lord
,
"
returned
the
jailer
,
with
a
grim
smile
.
<EOS>
Mounteagle
immediately
quitted
the
Tower
,
and
hastening
to
Whitehall
,
sought
out
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
to
whom
he
related
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
complimented
him
on
his
skilful
management
of
the
matter
;
and
congratulating
each
other
upon
having
got
rid
of
a
dangerous
and
now
useless
instrument
,
they
separated
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
Tresham
was
seized
with
a
sudden
illness
,
and
making
known
his
symptoms
to
Ipgreve
,
the
chirurgeon
who
attended
the
prison
was
sent
for
,
and
on
seeing
him
,
pronounced
him
dangerously
ill
,
though
he
was
at
a
loss
to
explain
the
nature
of
his
disorder
.
<EOS>
Every
hour
the
sick
man
grew
worse
,
and
he
was
torn
with
racking
pains
.
<EOS>
Connecting
his
sudden
seizure
with
the
visit
of
Lord
Mounteagle
,
an
idea
of
the
truth
flashed
upon
him
,
and
he
mentioned
his
suspicions
to
the
chirurgeon
,
charging
Jasper
Ipgreve
with
being
accessory
to
the
deed
.
<EOS>
The
jailer
stoutly
denied
the
accusation
,
and
charged
the
prisoner
in
his
turn
with
making
a
malicious
statement
to
bring
him
into
discredit
.
<EOS>
"I
will
soon
test
the
truth
of
his
assertion
,
"
observed
the
chirurgeon
,
taking
a
small
flat
piece
of
the
purest
gold
from
his
doublet
.
<EOS>
"
Place
this
in
your
mouth
.
<EOS>
"Tresham
<EOS>
obeyed
,
and
Ipgreve
watched
the
experiment
with
gloomy
curiosity
.
<EOS>
"You
are
a
dead
man
,
"
said
the
chirurgeon
to
Tresham
,
as
he
drew
forth
the
piece
of
gold
,
and
perceived
that
it
was
slightly
tarnished
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poison
has
been
administered
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Is
there
<EOS>
no
remedy
—
no
counter
-
poison
?
"
demanded
Tresham
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
The
chirurgeon
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Then
let
the
lieutenant
be
summoned
,
"
said
Tresham
;
<EOS>
"
I
have
an
important
confession
to
make
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
charge
this
man
,
"
pointing
to
the
jailer
,
"
with
giving
poisoned
wine
to
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
hear
what
I
say
to
you?""I
do
,
"
replied
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
he
will
never
reveal
it
,
"
said
Ipgreve
,
with
great
unconcern
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
a
warrant
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
for
what
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
""What
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Tresham
,
"
can
murder
be
committed
here
with
impunity?""You
<EOS>
have
to
thank
your
own
indiscretion
for
what
has
happened
,
"
rejoined
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
you
kept
a
close
tongue
in
your
head
,
you
would
have
been
safe
.
<EOS>
""Can
<EOS>
nothing
be
done
to
save
me
?
"
cried
the
miserable
man
,
with
an
imploring
look
at
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
the
person
appealed
to
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
advise
you
to
recommend
your
soul
to
God
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
not
inform
the
lieutenant
that
I
desire
to
speak
with
him
?
"
demanded
Tresham
.
<EOS>
The
chirurgeon
glanced
at
Ipgreve
,
and
receiving
a
sign
from
him
,
gave
a
promise
to
that
effect
.
<EOS>
They
then
quitted
the
cell
together
,
leaving
Tresham
in
a
state
of
indescribable
agony
both
of
mind
and
body
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
afterwards
,
the
chirurgeon
returned
,
and
informed
him
that
the
lieutenant
refused
to
visit
him
,
or
to
hear
his
confession
,
and
wholly
discredited
the
fact
of
his
being
poisoned
.
<EOS>
"I
will
take
charge
of
your
papers
,
if
you
choose
to
commit
them
to
me
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
will
lay
them
before
the
Council
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Tresham
;
"
while
life
remains
to
me
I
will
never
part
with
them
.
<EOS>
""I
have
brought
you
a
mixture
which
,
though
it
can
not
heal
you
,
will
,
at
least
,
allay
your
sufferings
,
"
said
the
chirurgeon
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
take
it
,
"
groaned
Tresham
.
<EOS>
"
I
distrust
you
as
much
as
the
others
.
<EOS>
""I
will
leave
it
with
you
,
at
all
events
,
"
rejoined
the
chirurgeon
,
setting
down
the
phial
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
the
bolts
shot
into
their
sockets
sounded
to
Tresham
as
if
his
tomb
were
closed
upon
him
,
and
he
uttered
a
cry
of
anguish
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
laid
violent
hands
upon
himself
,
and
accelerated
his
own
end
,
but
he
wanted
courage
to
do
so
,
and
continued
to
pace
backwards
and
forwards
across
his
chamber
as
long
as
his
strength
lasted
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
throw
himself
on
the
couch
,
from
which
he
never
expected
to
rise
again
,
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
phial
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
it
should
be
poison
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
it
will
end
my
sufferings
the
sooner
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
placing
it
to
his
lips
,
he
swallowed
its
contents
.
<EOS>
As
the
chirurgeon
had
foretold
,
it
alleviated
his
sufferings
,
and
throwing
himself
on
the
bed
he
sank
into
a
troubled
slumber
,
during
which
he
dreamed
that
Catesby
appeared
to
him
with
a
vengeful
countenance
,
and
tried
to
drag
him
into
a
fathomless
abyss
that
yawned
beneath
their
feet
.
<EOS>
Shrieking
with
agony
,
he
awoke
,
and
found
two
persons
standing
by
his
couch
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
the
jailer
,
and
the
other
appeared
,
from
his
garb
,
to
be
a
priest
;
but
a
hood
was
drawn
over
his
head
so
as
to
conceal
his
features
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
come
to
witness
my
dying
pangs
,
or
to
finish
me
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Tresham
of
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
"I
am
come
for
neither
purpose
,
"
replied
Ipgreve
;
"
I
pity
your
condition
,
and
have
brought
you
a
priest
of
your
own
faith
,
who
,
like
yourself
,
is
a
prisoner
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
I
will
leave
him
with
you
,
but
he
can
not
remain
long
,
so
make
the
most
of
your
time
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
these
words
,
he
retired
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
gone
,
the
supposed
priest
,
who
spoke
in
feeble
and
faltering
accents
,
desired
to
hear
Tresham
's
confession
,
and
having
listened
to
it
,
gave
him
absolution
.
<EOS>
The
wretched
man
then
drew
from
his
bosom
a
small
packet
,
and
offered
it
to
the
confessor
,
who
eagerly
received
it
.
<EOS>
"This
contains
the
letters
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
Lord
Mounteagle
,
which
I
have
just
mentioned
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
pray
you
lay
them
before
the
Privy
Council
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
fail
to
do
so
,
"
replied
the
confessor
.
<EOS>
And
reciting
the
prayer
for
one
in
extremis
over
the
dying
man
,
he
departed
.
<EOS>
"I
have
obtained
the
letters
from
him
,
"
said
Mounteagle
,
throwing
back
his
hood
as
he
quitted
the
chamber
,
and
addressing
the
jailer
.
<EOS>
"
And
now
you
need
give
yourself
no
further
concern
about
him
,
he
will
be
dead
before
morning
.
"Jasper
<EOS>
Ipgreve
locked
the
door
upon
the
prisoner
,
and
proceeded
to
the
Well
Tower
.
<EOS>
When
he
returned
,
he
found
Mounteagle
's
words
had
come
to
pass
.
<EOS>
Tresham
was
lying
on
the
floor
quite
dead
—
his
collapsed
frame
and
distorted
countenance
showing
the
agonies
in
which
he
must
have
expired

THE
TRIALThe
trial
of
the
conspirators
,
which
had
been
delayed
in
order
that
full
evidence
might
be
procured
against
them
,
was
,
at
length
,
appointed
to
take
place
in
Westminster
Hall
,
on
Monday
,
the
27th
of
January
,
1606
.
<EOS>
Early
on
the
morning
of
this
day
,
the
eight
surviving
confederates
(
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
being
at
this
time
secreted
at
Hendlip
)
were
conveyed
in
two
large
covered
wherries
from
the
fortress
to
the
place
of
trial
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
severity
of
the
weather,—it
was
snowing
heavily
,
and
the
river
was
covered
with
sheets
of
ice,—they
were
attended
by
a
vast
number
of
boats
filled
with
persons
anxious
to
obtain
a
sight
of
them
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
abhorrence
in
which
the
actors
in
the
conspiracy
were
held
by
the
populace
,
that
,
not
content
with
menaces
and
execrations
,
many
of
these
persons
hurled
missiles
against
the
wherries
,
and
would
have
proceeded
to
further
violence
if
they
had
not
been
restrained
by
the
pikemen
.
<EOS>
When
the
prisoners
landed
,
a
tremendous
and
fearful
shout
was
raised
by
the
mob
stationed
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
,
and
it
required
the
utmost
efforts
of
the
guard
to
protect
them
from
injury
.
<EOS>
Two
lines
of
soldiers
,
with
calivers
on
their
shoulders
,
were
drawn
out
from
the
banks
of
the
river
to
the
entrance
of
the
Hall
,
and
between
them
the
conspirators
marched
.
<EOS>
The
melancholy
procession
was
headed
by
Sir
William
Waad
,
who
was
followed
by
an
officer
of
the
guard
and
six
halberdiers
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
executioner
,
carrying
the
gleaming
implement
of
death
with
its
edge
turned
from
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
whose
noble
figure
and
handsome
countenance
excited
much
sympathy
among
the
beholders
,
and
Ambrose
Rookwood
.
<EOS>
Next
came
the
two
Winters
,
both
of
whom
appeared
greatly
dejected
.
<EOS>
Next
,
John
Grant
and
Robert
Bates,—Catesby
's
servant
,
who
had
been
captured
at
Holbeach
.
<EOS>
And
lastly
,
Keyes
and
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Bitterly
and
justly
incensed
as
were
the
multitude
against
the
conspirators
,
their
feelings
underwent
some
change
as
they
beheld
the
haggard
countenance
and
shattered
frame
of
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
It
was
soon
understood
that
he
was
the
individual
who
had
been
found
in
the
vault
near
the
Parliament
House
,
with
the
touchwood
and
matches
in
his
belt
ready
to
fire
the
train
;
and
the
greatest
curiosity
was
exhibited
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
foremost
of
the
conspirators
reached
the
entrance
of
the
Hall
,
a
terrific
yell
,
resembling
nothing
human
,
except
the
roar
of
a
thousand
tigers
thirsting
for
blood
,
was
uttered
by
the
mob
,
and
a
tremendous
but
ineffectual
attempt
was
made
to
break
through
the
lines
of
the
guard
.
<EOS>
Never
before
had
so
large
an
assemblage
been
collected
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
space
extending
on
one
hand
from
Westminster
Hall
to
the
gates
of
Whitehall
,
and
on
the
other
to
the
Abbey
,
was
filled
with
spectators
;
and
every
roof
,
window
,
and
buttress
was
occupied
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
interior
of
the
Hall
less
crowded
.
<EOS>
Not
an
inch
of
room
was
unoccupied
;
and
it
was
afterwards
complained
in
Parliament
,
that
the
members
of
the
house
had
been
so
pressed
and
incommoded
,
that
they
could
not
hear
what
was
said
at
the
arraignment
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
were
first
conveyed
to
the
court
of
the
Star
-
Chamber
,
where
they
remained
till
the
Lords
Commissioners
had
arrived
,
and
taken
their
seats
.
<EOS>
The
commissioners
were
the
Earl
of
Nottingham
,
Lord
High
Admiral
of
England
;
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
,
Steward
of
the
Household
;
the
Earl
of
Worcester
,
Master
of
the
Horse
;
the
Earl
of
Devonshire
,
Master
of
the
Ordnance
;
the
Earl
of
Northampton
,
Warden
of
the
Cinque
-
Ports
;
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
Principal
Secretary
of
State
;
Sir
John
Popham
,
Lord
Chief
Justice
;
Sir
Thomas
Fleming
,
Lord
Chief
Baron
of
the
Exchequer
;
and
Sir
Thomas
Walmisley
and
Sir
Peter
Warburton
,
Knights
,
and
both
Justices
of
the
Common
Pleas
.
<EOS>
Summoned
by
an
usher
,
the
conspirators
were
conducted
to
a
platform
covered
with
black
cloth
,
which
had
been
erected
at
the
lower
end
of
the
Hall
.
<EOS>
A
murmur
of
indignation
,
vainly
sought
to
be
repressed
by
the
grave
looks
of
the
Commissioners
,
burst
from
the
immense
assemblage
,
as
they
one
by
one
ascended
the
steps
of
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
was
the
last
to
mount
,
and
his
appearance
was
followed
by
a
deep
groan
.
<EOS>
Supporting
himself
against
the
rail
of
the
scaffold
,
he
surveyed
the
assemblage
with
a
stern
and
undaunted
look
.
<EOS>
As
he
gazed
around
,
he
could
not
help
marvelling
at
the
vast
multitude
before
him
.
<EOS>
The
whole
of
the
peers
and
all
the
members
of
the
House
of
Commons
were
present
,
while
in
a
box
on
the
left
,
though
screened
by
a
lattice
,
sat
the
Queen
and
Prince
Henry
;
and
in
another
on
the
right
,
and
protected
in
the
same
way
,
the
King
and
his
courtiers
.
<EOS>
Silence
being
peremptorily
commanded
,
the
indictment
was
read
,
wherein
the
prisoners
were
charged
with
conspiring
to
blow
up
the
King
and
the
peers
with
gunpowder
,
and
with
attempting
to
incite
the
Papists
,
and
other
persons
,
to
open
rebellion
;
to
which
all
the
conspirators
,
to
the
no
small
surprise
of
those
who
heard
them
,
and
were
aware
that
they
had
subscribed
their
confessions
,
pleaded
not
guilty
.
<EOS>
"How
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
,
in
a
stern
tone
to
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
With
what
face
can
you
pretend
to
deny
the
indictment
,
when
you
were
actually
taken
in
the
cellar
with
the
powder
,
and
have
already
confessed
your
treasonable
<EOS>
intentions?""I
do
not
mean
to
deny
what
I
have
confessed
,
my
lord
,
"
replied
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
indictment
contains
many
matters
which
I
neither
can
nor
will
countenance
by
assent
or
silence
.
<EOS>
And
I
therefore
deny
it
.
<EOS>
""It
is
well
,
"
replied
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
.
<EOS>
"
Let
the
trial
proceed
.
<EOS>
"The
indictment
being
opened
by
Sir
Edward
Philips
,
sergeant
-
at
-
law
,
he
was
followed
by
Sir
Edward
Coke
,
the
attorney
-
general
,
who
in
an
eloquent
and
elaborate
speech
,
which
produced
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
the
assemblage
,
expatiated
upon
the
monstrous
nature
of
the
plot
,
which
he
characterised
as
"
the
greatest
treason
that
ever
was
plotted
in
England
,
and
against
the
greatest
king
that
ever
reigned
in
England
;
"
and
after
narrating
the
origin
and
progress
of
the
conspiracy
,
concluded
by
desiring
that
the
confessions
of
the
prisoners
should
be
openly
read
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
jury
were
ordered
by
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
to
retire
,
and
the
injunction
being
obeyed
,
they
almost
instantly
returned
with
a
verdict
of
guilty
.
<EOS>
A
deep
,
dread
silence
then
prevailed
throughout
the
Hall
,
and
every
eye
was
bent
upon
the
conspirators
,
all
of
whom
maintained
a
composed
demeanour
.
<EOS>
They
were
then
questioned
by
the
Lord
Chief
Justice
whether
they
had
anything
to
say
why
judgment
of
death
should
not
be
pronounced
against
them
.
<EOS>
"All
<EOS>
I
have
to
crave
of
your
lordships
,
"
said
Thomas
Winter
,
"
is
,
that
being
the
chief
offender
of
the
two
,
I
may
die
for
my
brother
and
myself
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
ask
only
that
my
brother
's
request
may
not
be
granted
,
"
said
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
is
condemned
,
I
do
not
desire
to
live
.
<EOS>
""I
have
nothing
to
solicit
—
not
even
pardon
,
"
said
Keyes
,
carelessly
.
<EOS>
"
My
fortunes
were
always
desperate
,
and
are
better
now
than
they
have
ever
been
.
<EOS>
""I
desire
mercy
,
"
said
Rookwood
,
"
not
from
any
fear
of
death
,
but
because
so
shameful
an
ending
will
leave
a
perpetual
stain
upon
my
name
and
blood
.
<EOS>
I
humbly
submit
myself
to
the
King
,
and
pray
him
to
imitate
our
Supreme
Judge
,
who
sometimes
punishes
corporally
,
but
not
mortally
.
<EOS>
""I
have
been
guilty
of
a
conspiracy
,
intended
but
never
effected
,
"
said
John
Grant
,
"
and
solicit
forgiveness
on
that
plea
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
crime
has
been
fidelity
to
my
master
,
"
said
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
King
will
let
me
live
,
I
will
serve
him
as
faithfully
as
I
did
Mr.
Catesby
.
<EOS>
""I
would
not
utter
a
word
,
"
said
Fawkes
,
looking
sternly
round
;
"
if
I
did
not
fear
my
silence
might
be
misinterpreted
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
accept
a
pardon
if
it
were
offered
me
.
<EOS>
I
regard
the
project
as
a
glorious
one
,
and
only
lament
its
failure
.
<EOS>
""Silence
<EOS>
the
vile
traitor
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
rising
.
<EOS>
And
as
he
spoke
two
halberdiers
sprang
up
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
,
and
placing
themselves
on
either
side
of
Fawkes
,
prepared
to
gag
him
.
<EOS>
"I
have
done
,
"
he
said
,
contemptuously
regarding
them
.
<EOS>
"I
have
nothing
to
say
save
this
,
"
said
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
bowing
to
the
judges
.
<EOS>
"
If
any
of
your
lordships
will
tell
me
you
forgive
me
,
I
shall
go
more
cheerfully
to
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
forgive
you
,
Sir
Everard
,
"
said
the
Earl
of
Nottingham
,
returning
his
reverence
,
"
as
we
do
.
<EOS>
""I
humbly
thank
your
lordship
,
"
replied
Digby
.
<EOS>
Sentence
was
then
passed
upon
the
prisoners
by
Lord
Chief
Justice
Popham
,
and
they
were
removed
from
the
platform
.
<EOS>
As
they
issued
from
the
Hall
,
and
it
became
known
to
the
assemblage
without
that
they
were
condemned
,
a
shout
of
fierce
exultation
rent
the
air
,
and
they
were
so
violently
assailed
on
all
sides
,
that
they
had
great
difficulty
in
reaching
the
wherries
.
<EOS>
The
guard
,
however
,
succeeded
,
at
length
,
in
accomplishing
their
embarkation
,
and
they
were
conveyed
back
in
safety
to
the
Tower

THE
LAST
MEETING
OF
FAWKES
AND
VIVIANAUp
to
this
time
,
Viviana
had
not
been
allowed
another
interview
with
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
She
was
twice
interrogated
by
the
Privy
-
Council
,
but
having
confessed
all
she
knew
of
the
conspiracy
,
excepting
what
might
implicate
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
,
neither
of
whom
she
was
aware
had
been
apprehended
,
she
was
not
again
subjected
to
the
torture
.
<EOS>
Her
health
,
however
,
rapidly
sank
under
her
confinement
,
and
she
was
soon
reduced
to
such
an
extreme
state
of
debility
that
she
could
not
leave
her
bed
.
<EOS>
The
chirurgeon
having
been
called
in
by
Dame
Ipgreve
to
attend
her
,
reported
her
condition
to
Sir
William
Waad
,
who
directed
that
every
means
should
be
adopted
for
her
restoration
,
and
that
Ruth
Ipgreve
should
remain
in
constant
attendance
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Ascertaining
all
particulars
relative
to
Guy
Fawkes
from
the
jailer
's
daughter
,
it
was
a
sad
satisfaction
to
Viviana
to
learn
that
he
spent
his
whole
time
in
devotion
,
and
appeared
completely
resigned
to
his
fate
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
's
purpose
to
bring
Viviana
to
trial
at
the
same
time
as
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
,
but
the
chirurgeon
reporting
that
her
removal
at
this
juncture
would
be
attended
with
fatal
consequences
,
he
was
compelled
to
defer
it
.
<EOS>
When
the
result
of
the
trial
was
made
known
to
Viviana
by
Ruth
,
though
she
had
anticipated
the
condemnation
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
she
swooned
away
,
and
on
her
recovery
,
observed
to
Ruth
,
who
was
greatly
alarmed
at
her
looks
<EOS>
,
"
I
feel
I
am
going
fast
.
<EOS>
I
should
wish
to
see
my
husband
once
more
before
I
die
.
<EOS>
""I
fear
it
is
impossible
,
madam
,
"
replied
Ruth
;
"
but
I
will
try
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
so
,
"
rejoined
Viviana
;
"
and
my
blessing
shall
rest
ever
on
your
head
.
<EOS>
""Have
you
any
valuable
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
My
heart
bleeds
to
make
the
demand
at
such
a
moment
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
the
only
way
to
produce
an
effect
on
the
avaricious
nature
of
my
father
.
<EOS>
""I
have
nothing
but
this
golden
crucifix
,
"
said
Viviana
;
"
and
I
meant
to
give
it
to
you
.
<EOS>
""It
will
be
better
employed
in
this
way
,
"
rejoined
Ruth
,
taking
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
Quitting
the
cell
,
she
hurried
to
the
Well
Tower
,
and
found
her
father
,
who
had
just
returned
from
locking
up
the
conspirators
in
their
different
dungeons
,
sitting
down
to
his
evening
meal
.
<EOS>
"What
is
the
matter
with
the
wench
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
staring
at
her
.
<EOS>
"
You
look
quite
distracted
.
<EOS>
Is
Viviana
Radcliffe
dead?""No
;
but
she
is
dying
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
that
is
the
case
I
must
go
to
her
directly
,
"
observed
Dame
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"
She
may
have
some
valuable
about
her
which
I
must
secure
.
<EOS>
""You
will
be
disappointed
,
mother
,
"
rejoined
Ruth
,
with
a
look
of
irrepressible
disgust
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
has
nothing
valuable
left
but
this
golden
crucifix
,
which
she
has
sent
to
my
father
,
on
condition
of
his
allowing
Guy
Fawkes
to
see
her
before
she
dies
.
<EOS>
""Give
it
<EOS>
me
,
wench
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Jasper
Ipgreve
;
"
and
let
her
die
in
peace
.
<EOS>
""She
will
not
die
in
peace
unless
she
sees
him
,
"
replied
Ruth
.
<EOS>
"
Nor
shall
you
have
it
,
if
you
do
not
comply
with
her
request
.
""How
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
her
father
,
"
do
you
dare——""Think
not
to
terrify
me
,
father
,
"
interrupted
Ruth
;
"
I
am
resolute
in
this
.
<EOS>
Hear
me
,
"
she
cried
,
seizing
his
arm
,
and
fixing
a
look
upon
him
that
seemed
to
pierce
his
soul,—"hear
me
,
"
she
said
,
in
a
tone
so
low
as
to
be
inaudible
to
her
mother
;
"
she
shall
see
him
,
or
I
will
denounce
you
as
the
murderer
of
Tresham
.
<EOS>
Now
will
you
comply?""Give
me
the
cross
,
"
said
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
till
you
have
earned
it
,
"
replied
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
"
he
rejoined
;
"
if
it
must
be
,
it
must
.
<EOS>
But
I
may
get
into
trouble
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
must
consult
Master
Forsett
,
the
gentleman
jailer
,
who
has
the
charge
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
before
I
dare
take
him
to
her
cell
.
<EOS>
""Consult
<EOS>
whom
you
please
,
"
rejoined
Ruth
,
impatiently
;
"
but
lose
no
time
,
or
you
will
be
too
late
.
<EOS>
"Muttering
<EOS>
imprecations
on
his
daughter
,
Ipgreve
left
the
Well
Tower
,
and
Ruth
hurried
back
to
Viviana
,
whom
she
found
anxiously
expecting
her
,
and
related
to
her
what
she
had
done
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
that
I
may
hold
out
till
he
comes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
;
"
but
my
strength
is
failing
fast
.
<EOS>
"Ruth
endeavoured
to
comfort
her
;
but
she
was
unequal
to
the
effort
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
knelt
down
,
and
wept
upon
the
pillow
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
had
now
elapsed
.
<EOS>
It
seemed
an
age
to
the
poor
sufferers
,
and
still
the
jailer
came
not
,
and
even
Ruth
had
given
up
all
hope
,
when
a
heavy
tread
was
heard
in
the
passage
;
the
door
was
opened
;
and
Guy
Fawkes
appeared
,
attended
by
Ipgreve
and
Forsett
.
"We
will
not
interrupt
your
parting
,
"
said
Forsett
,
who
seemed
to
have
a
touch
of
humanity
in
his
composition
.
<EOS>
And
beckoning
to
Ruth
to
follow
him
,
he
quitted
the
cell
with
Ipgreve
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
,
meanwhile
,
had
approached
the
couch
,
and
gazed
with
an
expression
of
intense
anguish
at
Viviana
.
<EOS>
She
returned
his
glance
with
a
look
of
the
utmost
affection
,
and
clasped
his
hand
between
her
thin
fingers
.
<EOS>
"I
am
now
standing
on
the
brink
of
eternity
,
"
she
said
in
a
solemn
tone
,
"
and
I
entreat
you
earnestly
,
as
you
hope
to
insure
our
meeting
hereafter
,
to
employ
the
few
days
left
you
in
sincere
and
hearty
repentance
.
<EOS>
You
have
sinned
—
sinned
deeply
,
but
not
beyond
the
power
of
redemption
.
<EOS>
Let
me
feel
that
I
have
saved
you
,
and
my
last
moments
will
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
by
the
love
I
have
borne
you
—
by
the
pangs
I
have
endured
for
you
—
by
the
death
I
am
now
dying
for
you
—
let
me
implore
you
not
to
lose
one
moment
,

to
supplicate
a
merciful
Providence
to
pardon
your
offence
.
<EOS>
"Illustration"I
<EOS>
will
—
I
will
,
"
rejoined
Fawkes
,
in
broken
accents
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
opened
my
eyes
to
my
error
,
and
I
sincerely
repent
it
.
<EOS>
""Saved
!
<EOS>
saved
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Viviana
,
raising
herself
in
the
bed
.
<EOS>
Opening
her
arms
,
she
strained
him
to
her
bosom
;
and
for
a
few
moments
they
mingled
their
tears
together
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
"
she
said
,
sinking
backwards
,
"
kneel
by
me
—
pray
for
forgiveness
—
pray
audibly
,
and
I
will
join
in
your
prayer
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
knelt
by
the
bedside
,
and
addressed
the
most
earnest
supplications
to
Heaven
for
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
For
a
while
he
heard
Viviana
's
gentle
accents
accompany
him
.
<EOS>
They
grew
fainter
and
fainter
,
until
at
last
they
totally
ceased
.
<EOS>
Filled
with
a
dreadful
apprehension
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
An
angelic
smile
illumined
her
countenance
;
her
gaze
was
fixed
on
him
for
one
moment
—
it
then
grew
dim
and
dimmer
,
until
it
was
extinguished
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
uttered
a
cry
of
the
wildest
despair
,
and
fell
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
sound
,
Forsett
and
Ipgreve
,
who
were
standing
outside
,
rushed
into
the
cell
,
and
instantly
raised
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
now
in
a
state
of
distraction
,
and
for
the
moment
seemed
endowed
with
all
his
former
strength
.
<EOS>
Striving
to
break
from
them
,
he
cried
,
in
a
tone
of
the
most
piercing
anguish
,
"
You
shall
not
tear
me
from
her
!
<EOS>
I
will
die
with
her
!
<EOS>
Let
me
go
,
I
say
,
or
I
will
dash
out
my
brains
against
these
flinty
walls
,
and
balk
you
of
your
prey
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
his
struggles
were
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
held
him
fast
,
and
calling
for
further
assistance
,
conveyed
him
to
his
cell
,
where
,
fearing
he
might
do
some
violence
to
himself
,
they
placed
him
in
irons
.
<EOS>
Ruth
entered
the
cell
as
soon
as
Fawkes
and
the
others
had
quitted
it
,
and
performed
the
last
sad
offices
for
the
departed
.
<EOS>
Alternately
praying
and
weeping
,
she
watched
by
the
body
during
the
whole
of
the
night
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
the
remains
of
the
unfortunate
Viviana
were
interred
in
the
chapel
of
Saint
Peter
on
the
Green
,
and
the
sole
mourner
was
the
jailer
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
"Peace
be
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Ruth
,
as
she
turned
away
from
the
grave
.
<EOS>

<EOS>
—
<EOS>
SAINT
PAUL
'S
<EOS>
CHURCHYARDGuy
Fawkes
was
for
some
time
wholly
inconsolable
.
<EOS>
His
stoical
nature
seemed
completely
subdued
,
and
he
wept
like
an
infant
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
however
,
the
violence
of
his
grief
abated
,
and
calling
to
mind
the
last
injunctions
of
her
whose
loss
he
mourned
,
he
addressed
himself
to
prayer
,
and
acknowledging
his
guilt
,
besought
her
intercession
with
Heaven
for
his
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
It
will
not
seem
strange
,
when
his
superstitious
character
is
taken
into
consideration
,
that
he
should
fancy
he
received
an
immediate
proof
that
his
prayers
were
heard
.
<EOS>
To
his
excited
imagination
it
appeared
that
a
soft
unearthly
strain
of
music
floated
in
the
air
over
his
head
;
that
an
odour
like
that
of
Paradise
filled
his
cell
;
while
an
invisible
finger
touched
his
brow
.
<EOS>
While
in
this
entranced
state
,
he
was
utterly
insensible
to
his
present
miserable
situation
,
and
he
seemed
to
have
a
foretaste
of
celestial
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
,
however
,
desist
from
prayer
,
but
continued
his
supplications
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
On
that
night
,
he
was
visited
by
the
lieutenant
,
who
announced
to
him
that
the
execution
of
four
of
the
conspirators
was
fixed
for
Thursday
<EOS>
(
it
was
then
Tuesday
)
,
while
his
own
and
that
of
the
three
others
would
not
take
place
till
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
you
are
the
greatest
traitor
of
all
,
your
execution
will
be
reserved
to
the
last
,
"
pursued
Waad
.
<EOS>
"
No
part
of
the
sentence
will
be
omitted
.
<EOS>
You
will
be
dragged
to
Old
Palace
Yard
,
over
against
the
scene
of
your
intended
bloody
and
damnable
action
,
at
a
horse
's
tail
,
and
will
be
there
turned
off
the
gallows
,
and
hanged
,
but
not
till
you
are
dead
.
<EOS>
You
will
then
be
embowelled
;
your
vile
heart
,
which
conceived
this
atrocious
design
,
will
be
torn
beating
from
your
breast
;
and
your
quarters
will
be
placed
on
the
palace
gates
as
an
abhorrent
spectacle
in
the
eyes
of
men
,
and
a
terrible
proof
of
the
King
's
just
vengeance
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
heard
the
recapitulation
of
his
dreadful
sentence
unmoved
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
sole
mercy
<EOS>
I
would
have
craved
of
his
Majesty
would
have
been
permission
to
die
first

"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
Heaven
's
will
be
done
!
<EOS>
I
deserve
my
doom
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
is
your
stubborn
nature
at
length
subdued
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
lieutenant
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
repent
of
your
offence?""Deeply
and
heartily
,
"
returned
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
"Make
<EOS>
the
sole
amends
in
your
power
for
it
,
then
,
and
disclose
the
names
of
all
who
have
been
connected
with
the
atrocious
design
,
"
rejoined
Waad
.
<EOS>
"I
confess
myself
guilty
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
humbly
.
"
<EOS>
But
I
accuse
no
others
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
die
impenitent
,
"
rejoined
the
lieutenant
,
"
and
can
not
hope
for
mercy
hereafter
.
<EOS>
"Guy
<EOS>
Fawkes
made
no
answer
,
but
bowed
his
head
upon
his
breast
,
and
the
lieutenant
,
darting
a
malignant
look
at
him
,
quitted
the
cell
.
<EOS>
On
the
following
day
,
the
whole
of
the
conspirators
were
taken
to
St.
John
's
chapel
,
in
the
White
Tower
,
where
a
discourse
was
pronounced
to
them
by
Doctor
Overall
,
Dean
of
St.
Paul
's
,
who
enlarged
upon
the
enormity
of
their
offence
,
and
exhorted
them
to
repentance
.
<EOS>
The
discourse
over
,
they
were
about
to
be
removed
,
when
two
ladies
,
clad
in
mourning
habits
,
entered
the
chapel
.
<EOS>
These
were
Lady
Digby
and
Mrs.
Rookwood
,
and
they
immediately
flew
to
their
husbands
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
conspirators
walked
away
,
and
averted
their
gaze
from
the
painful
scene
.
<EOS>
After
an
ineffectual
attempt
to
speak
,
Lady
Digby
swooned
away
,
and
was
committed
by
her
husband
,
while
in
a
state
of
insensibility
,
to
the
care
of
an
attendant
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Rookwood
,
however
,
who
was
a
woman
of
high
spirit
,
and
great
personal
attractions
,
though
the
latter
were
now
wasted
by
affliction
,
maintained
her
composure
,
and
encouraging
her
husband
to
bear
up
manfully
against
his
situation
,
tenderly
embraced
him
,
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
The
conspirators
were
then
taken
back
to
their
cells
.
<EOS>
At
an
early
hour
on
the
following
morning
the
four
miserable
persons
intended
for
death
,
namely
,
Sir
Everard
Digby
,
the
elder
Winter
,
John
Grant
,
and
Bates
,
were
conducted
to
the
Beauchamp
Tower
.
<EOS>
Bates
would
have
stood
aloof
from
his
superiors
;
but
Sir
Everard
Digby
took
him
kindly
by
the
hand
,
and
drew
him
towards
them
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
distinctions
must
be
observed
now
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
We
ought
to
beg
pardon
of
thee

my
poor
fellow

for
bringing
thee
into
this
strait

<EOS>
""Think
not
of
me
,
worshipful
sir

"
replied
Bates
.
<EOS>
"
I
loved
Mr.
Catesby
so
well

would
have
laid
down
my

die
cheerfully
in

cause

Robert
Winter
to
Sir
William
Waad
,
who
stood
near
them
with
Forsett
and
Ipgreve
,
"
I
pray
you
commend
me
to
my
brother
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
I
die
in
entire
love
of
him
,
and
if
it
is
possible
for
the
departed
to
watch
over
the
living
,
I
will
be
with
him
at
his
last
hour
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
,
a
trampling
of
horses
was
heard
on
the
green
,
and
the
lieutenant
proceeding
to
the
grated
window
,
saw
four
mounted
troopers
,
each
having
a
sledge
and
hurdle
attached
by
ropes
to
his
steed
,
drawn
up
before
the
door
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
gazing
at
them
,
an
officer
entered
the
room
,
and
informed
him
that
all
was
in
readiness
.
<EOS>
Sir
William
Waad
then
motioned
the
prisoners
to
follow
him
,
and
they
descended
the
spiral
staircase
.
<EOS>
The
green
was
thronged
with
horse
and
foot
soldiers
,
and
as
the
conspirators
issued
from
the
arched
door
of
the
fortification
,
the
bell
of
Saint
Peter
's
chapel
began
to
toll
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Digby
was
first
bound
to
a
hurdle
,
with
his
face
towards
the
horse
,
and
the
others
were
quickly
secured
in
the
same
manner
.
<EOS>
The
melancholy
cavalcade
was
then
put
in
motion
.
<EOS>
A
troop
of
horse
-
soldiers
in
their
full
accoutrements
,
and
with
calivers
upon
their
shoulders
,
rode
first
;
then
came
a
band
of
halberdiers
on
foot
;
then
the
masked
executioner
mounted
on
a
led
horse
,
then
the
four
prisoners
on
the
hurdles
,
one
after
the
other
;
then
the
lieutenant
on
horseback
;
while
another
band
of
horse
-
soldiers
,
equipped
like
the
first
,
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
They
were
met
by
the
Recorder
of
London
,
Sir
Henry
Montague
,
and
the
sheriffs
,
at
the
gate
of
the
Middle
Tower
,
to
the
latter
of
whom
<EOS>
the
lieutenant
,
according
to
custom
,
delivered
up
the
bodies
of
the
prisoners
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
delay
,
the
train
again
set
forward
,
and
emerging
from
the
Bulwark
Gate
,
proceeded
through
an
enormous
concourse
of
spectators
towards
Tower
-
street
.
<EOS>
Aware
that
a
vast
crowd
would
be
assembled
in
the
city
,
and
apprehensive
of
some
popular
tumult
,
the
Lord
Mayor
had
issued
precepts
to
the
aldermen
of
every
ward
,
commanding
them
"
to
cause
one
able
and
sufficient
person
,
with
a
halbert
in
his
hand
,
to
stand
at
the
door
of
every
dwelling
-
house
in
the
open
street
in
the
way
that
the
traitors
were
to
be
drawn
towards
the
place
of
execution
,
there
to
remain
from
seven
in
the
morning
until
the
return
of
the
sheriffs
.
<EOS>
"
But
these
were
not
the
whole
of
the
arrangements
made
to
preserve
order
.
<EOS>
The
cavalcade
,
it
was
fixed
,
was
to
proceed
along
Tower
-
street
,
Gracechurch
street
,
Lombard
-
street
,
Cheapside
,
and
so
on
to
the
west
end
of
Saint
Paul
's
cathedral
,
where
the
scaffold
was
erected
.
<EOS>
Along
the
whole
road
,
on
either
side
,
a
line
of
halberdiers
was
drawn
up
,
while
barriers
were
erected
against
the
cross
streets
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
precautions
needless
.
<EOS>
Such
a
vast
concourse
was
collected
,
that
nothing
but
the
presence
of
a
strong
armed
force
could
have
prevented
confusion
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
The
roofs
of
all
the
houses
,
the
towers
of
the
churches
,
the
steps
of
the
crosses
were
covered
with
spectators
,
who
groaned
and
hooted
as
the
conspirators
passed
by
.
<EOS>
The
scaffold
,
as
has
just
been
stated
,
was
erected
in
front
of
the
great
western
entrance
of
the
cathedral
.
<EOS>
The
mighty
valves
of
the
sacred
structure
were
thrown
open
,
and
disclosed
its
columned
aisles
crowded
with
spectators
,
as
was
its
roof
and
central
tower
.
<EOS>
The
great
bell
,
which
had
begun
to
toll
when
the
melancholy
procession
came
in
sight
,
continued
to
pour
forth
its
lugubrious
sounds
during
the
whole
of
the
ceremonial
.
<EOS>
The
rolling
of
muffled
drums
was
likewise
heard
above
the
tumultuous
murmurs
of
the
impatient
multitude
.
<EOS>
The
whole
area
from
the
cathedral
to
Ludgate
-
hill
was
filled
with
spectators
,
but
an
open
space
was
kept
clear
in
front
of
the
scaffold
,
in
which
the
prisoners
were
one
by
one
unbound
from
the
hurdles
.
<EOS>
During
this
awful
pause
,
they
had
sufficient
time
to
note
the
whole
of
the
dreadful
preparations
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
distance
from
them
was
a
large
fire
,
on
which
boiled
a
caldron
of
pitch
,
destined
to
receive
their
dismembered
limbs
.
<EOS>
A
tall
gallows
,
approached
by
a
double
ladder
,
sprung
from
the
scaffold
,
on
which
the
hangman
was
already
mounted
with
the
rope
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
At
the
foot
of
the
ladder
was
the
quartering
-
block
,
near
which
stood
the
masked
executioner
with
a
chopper
in
his
hand
,
and
two
large
sharp
knives
in
his
girdle
.
<EOS>
His
arms
were
bared
to
the
shoulder
;
and
a
leathern
apron
,
soiled
by
gory
stains
,
and
tied
round
his
waist
,
completed
his
butcherly
appearance
.
<EOS>
Straw
was
scattered
upon
the
scaffold
near
the
block
.
<EOS>
Sir
Everard
Digby
was
the
first
to
receive
the
fatal
summons
.
<EOS>
He
mounted
with
a
firm
footstep
,
and
his
youth
,
his
noble
aspect
,
and
undaunted
demeanour
,
awakened
,
as
before
,
the
sympathy
of
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
Looking
round
,
he
thus
addressed
the
assemblage:—"Good
people
,
I
am
here
about
to
die
,
ye
<EOS>
well
know
for
what
cause
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
matter
,
I
have
acted
according
to
the
dictates
of
my
conscience
.
<EOS>
They
have
led
me
to
undertake
this
enterprise
,
which
,
in
respect
of
my
religion
,
I
hold
to
be
no
offence
,
but
in
respect
of
the
law
a
heinous
offence
,
and
I
therefore
ask
forgiveness
of
God
,
of
the
King
,
and
of
the
whole
realm
.
<EOS>
"Crossing
<EOS>
himself
devoutly
,
he
then
knelt
down
,
and
recited
his
prayers
in
Latin
,
after
which
he
arose
,
and
again
looking
round
,
said
in
an
earnest
voice,"I
desire
the
prayers
of
all
good
Catholics
,
and
of
none
other
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
none
will
pray
for
you
,
"
replied
several
voices
from
the
crowd
.
<EOS>
Heedless
of
the
retort
,
Sir
Everard
surrendered
himself
to
the
executioner
's
assistant
,
who
divested
him
of
his
cloak
and
doublet
,
and
unfastened
his
collar
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
,
he
mounted
the
ladder
,
and
the
hangman
fulfilled
his
office
.
<EOS>
Robert
Winter
was
next
summoned
,
and
ascended
the
scaffold
with
great
firmness
.
<EOS>
Everything
proclaimed
the
terrible
tragedy
that
had
just
been
enacted
.
<EOS>
The
straw
was
sprinkled
with
blood
,
so
was
the
block
,
so
were
the
long
knives
of
the
executioner
,
whose
hands
and
arms
were
dyed
with
the
same
crimson
stain
;
while
in
one
corner
of
the
scaffold
stood
a
basket
,
containing
the
dismembered
limbs
of
the
late
unfortunate
sufferer
.
<EOS>
But
these
dreadful
sights
produced
no
effect
on
Robert
Winter
.
<EOS>
Declining
to
address
the
assemblage
,
he
at
once
surrendered
himself
to
the
assistant
,
and
shared
the
fate
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Grant
was
the
next
to
follow
.
<EOS>
Undismayed
as
his
predecessor
,
he
looked
round
with
a
cheerful
countenance
,
and
said,—"I
am
about
to
suffer
the
death
of
a
traitor
,
and
am
content
to
die
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
satisfied
that
our
project
was
so
far
from
being
sinful
,
that
I
rely
entirely
on
my
merits
in
bearing
a
part
in
it
,
as
an
abundant
satisfaction
and
expiation
for
all
the
sins
I
have
at
other
times
of
my
life
committed
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
speech
was
received
by
a
terrific
yell
from
the
multitude
.
<EOS>
Wholly
unmoved
,
however
,
Grant
uttered
a
few
prayers
,
and
then
crossing
himself
,
mounted
the
ladder
and
was
quickly
despatched
.
<EOS>
The
bloody
business
was
completed
by
the
slaughter
of
Bates
,
who
died
as
resolutely
as
the
others
.
<EOS>
These
executions
,
being
conducted
with
the
utmost
deliberation
,
occupied
nearly
an
hour
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
then
separated
to
talk
over
the
sight
they
had
witnessed
,
and
to
keep
holiday
during
the
remainder
of
the
day
;
rejoicing
that
an
equally
-
exciting
spectacle
was
in
store
for
them
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
XVI

<EOS>
—
OLD
PALACE
YARDGuy
Fawkes
's
tranquillity
of
mind
did
not
desert
him
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
as
his
term
of
life
drew
near
its
close
,
he
became
more
cheerful
and
resigned
;
his
sole
anxiety
being
that
all
should
be
speedily
terminated
.
<EOS>
When
Ipgreve
took
leave
of
him
for
the
night
,
he
threw
himself
on
his
couch
and
soon
fell
into
a
gentle
slumber
.
<EOS>
His
dreams
were
soothing
,
and
he
fancied
that
Viviana
appeared
to
him
clad
in
robes
of
snowy
whiteness
,
and
regarding
him
with
a
smiling
countenance
,
promised
that
the
gates
of
eternal
happiness
would
be
opened
to
him
on
the
morrow
.
<EOS>
Awaking
about
four
o'clock
,
he
passed
the
interval
between
that
time
and
his
summons
by
the
jailer
in
earnest
prayer
.
<EOS>
At
six
o'clock
,
Ipgreve
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
accompanied
by
his
daughter
,
who
had
prevailed
on
him
to
allow
her
to
take
leave
of
the
prisoner
.
<EOS>
She
acquainted
Fawkes
with
all
particulars
of
the
interment
of
Viviana
,
to
which
he
listened
with
tearful
interest
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
my
remains
might
be
laid
beside
her
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
fate
forbids
it!""Truly
,
does
it
,
"
observed
Ipgreve
,
gruffly
;
"
unless
you
would
have
her
body
removed
to
the
spikes
of
Whitehall
gates
.
<EOS>
"Disregarding
<EOS>
this
brutal
speech
,
which
called
a
blush
of
shame
to
the
cheeks
of
Ruth
,
Fawkes
affectionately
pressed
her
hand
,
and
said,"Do
not
forget
me
in
your
prayers
,
and
sometimes
visit
the
grave
of
Viviana
.
<EOS>
""Doubt
it
not
,
"
she
replied
,
in
accents
half
suffocated
by
grief
.
<EOS>
Fawkes
then
bade
her
farewell
,
and
followed
the
jailer
through
various
intricate
passages
,
which
brought
them
to
a
door
opening
upon
one
of
the
lower
chambers
of
the
Beauchamp
Tower
.
<EOS>
Unlocking
it
,
Ipgreve
led
the
way
up
the
circular
staircase
,
and
ushered
his
companion
into
the
large
chamber
where
Rookwood
,
Keyes
,
and
Thomas
Winter
were
already
assembled
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
clear
,
but
frosty
,
and
bitterly
cold
;
and
when
the
lieutenant
appeared
,
Rookwood
besought
him
to
allow
them
a
fire
as
their
last
earthly
indulgence
.
<EOS>
The
request
was
peremptorily
refused
.
<EOS>
A
cup
of
hot
spiced
wine
was
,
however
,
offered
them
,
and
accepted
by
all
except
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
hour
as
on
the
previous
day
,
the
hurdles
were
brought
to
the
entrance
of
the
fortification
,
and
the
prisoners
bound
to
them
.
<EOS>
The
recorder
and
sheriffs
met
them
at
the
Middle
Tower
,
as
they
had
done
the
other
conspirators
,
and
the
cavalcade
set
forth
.
<EOS>
The
crowd
was
even
greater
than
on
the
former
occasion
;
and
it
required
the
utmost
exertion
on
the
part
of
the
guard
to
maintain
order
.
<EOS>
Some
little
delay
occurred
at
Ludgate
;
and
during
this
brief
halt
,
Rookwood
heard
a
cry
,
and
looking
up
,
perceived
his
wife
at
the
upper
window
of
one
of
the
habitations
,
waving
her
handkerchief
to
him
,
and
cheering
him
by
her
gestures
.
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
to
answer
her
by
signs
;
but
his
hands
were
fast
bound
,
and
the
next
moment
,
the
cavalcade
moved
on
.
<EOS>
At
Temple
Bar
another
halt
occurred
;
and
as
the
train
moved
slowly
forward
,
an
immense
crowd
,
like
a
swollen
stream
,
swept
after
it
.
<EOS>
The
two
gates
at
Whitehall
,
then
barring
the
road
to
Westminster
,
were
opened
as
the
train
approached
,
and
a
certain
portion
of
the
concourse
allowed
to
pass
through
.
<EOS>
The
scaffold
,
which
had
been
removed
from
Saint
Paul
's
,
was
erected
in
the
middle
of
Old
Palace
Yard
,
in
front
of
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
Around
it
were
circled
a
band
of
halberdiers
,
outside
whom
stood
a
dense
throng
.
<EOS>
The
buttresses
and
pinnacles
of
the
Abbey
were
covered
with
spectators
;
so
was
the
roof
of
the
Parliament
House
,
and
the
gallery
over
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
The
bell
of
the
Abbey
began
to
toll
as
the
train
passed
through
the
gates
of
Whitehall
,
and
its
deep
booming
filled
the
air
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
conspirators
were
released
from
the
hurdles
,
Topcliffe
,
who
had
evidently
from
his
disordered
attire
arrived
from
a
long
journey
,
rode
up
,
and
dismounted
.
<EOS>
"I
am
just
in
time
,
"
he
cried
,
with
an
exulting
glance
at
the
conspirators
;
"
this
is
not
the
last
execution
I
shall
witness
.
<EOS>
Fathers
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
are
prisoners
,
and
on
their
way
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
was
a
long
time
in
unearthing
the
priestly
foxes
,
but
I
succeeded
at
last
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
an
officer
approached
,
and
summoned
Thomas
Winter
to
mount
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
He
obeyed
,
and
exhibited
no
symptom
of
quailing
,
except
that
his
complexion
suddenly
turned
to
a
livid
colour
.
<EOS>
Being
told
of
this
by
the
lieutenant
,
he
tried
to
account
for
it
by
saying
that
he
thought
he
saw
his
brother
precede
him
up
the
steps
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
brief
address
,
protesting
he
died
a
true
Catholic
,
and
in
that
faith
,
notwithstanding
his
offences
,
hoped
to
be
saved
.
<EOS>
Rookwood
followed
him
,
and
indulged
in
a
somewhat
longer
oration
.
<EOS>
"
I
confess
my
offence
to
God
,
"
he
said
,
"
in
seeking
to
shed
blood
,
and
implore
his
mercy
.
<EOS>
I
likewise
confess
my
offence
to
the
King
,
of
whose
majesty
I
humbly
ask
forgiveness
;
and
I
further
confess
my
offence
to
the
whole
state
,
of
whom
in
general
I
entreat
pardon
.
<EOS>
May
the
Almighty
bless
the
King
,
the
Queen
,
and
all
their
royal
progeny
,
and
grant
them
a
long
and
happy
reign
!
<EOS>
May
He
turn
their
hearts
to
the
Catholic
faith
,
so
that
heresy
may
be
wholly
extirpated
from
the
kingdom!"The
first
part
of
this
speech
was
well
received
by
the
assemblage
,
but
the
latter
was
drowned
in
groans
and
hootings
,
amid
which
Rookwood
was
launched
into
eternity
.
<EOS>
Keyes
came
next
,
and
eyeing
the
assemblage
disdainfully
,
went
up
the
ladder
,
and
threw
himself
off
with
such
force
that
he
broke
the
rope
,
and
was
instantly
despatched
by
the
executioner
and
his
assistants
.
<EOS>
Guy
Fawkes
now
alone
remained
,
and
he
slowly
mounted
the
scaffold
.
<EOS>
His
foot
slipped
on
the
blood
-
stained
boards
,
and
he
would
have
fallen
,
if
Topcliffe
,
who
stood
near
him
,
had
not
caught
his
hand
.
<EOS>
A
deep
silence
prevailed
as
he
looked
around
,
and
uttered
the
following
words
in
a
clear
and
distinct
voice:—"I
ask
forgiveness
of
the
King
and
the
state
for
my
criminal
intention
,
and
trust
that
my
death
will
wash
out
my
offence
.
"He
<EOS>
then
crossed
himself
and
knelt
down
to
pray
,
after
which
his
cloak
and
doublet
were
removed
by
the
executioner
's
assistant
and
placed
with
those
of
the
other
conspirators
.
<EOS>
He
made
an
effort
to
mount
the
ladder
,
but
his
stiffened
limbs
refused
their
office
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
courage
fails
you
,
"
sneered
Topcliffe
,
laying
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
strength
does
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
sternly
regarding
him
.
"
<EOS>
Help
me
up
the
ladder
,
and
you
shall
see
whether
I
am
afraid
to
die
.
<EOS>
"Seeing
<EOS>
how
matters
stood
,
the
executioner
who
stood
by
,
leaning
upon
his
chopper
,
tendered
him
his
blood
-
stained
hand
.
<EOS>
But
Fawkes
rejected
it
with
disgust
,
and
exerting
all
his
strength
,
forced
himself
up
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
As
the
hangman
adjusted
the
rope
,
he
observed
a
singular
smile
illumine
the
features
of
his
victim
.
<EOS>
"You
seem
happy
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
am
so
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Fawkes
,
earnestly,—"I
see
the
form
of
her
<EOS>
I
loved
beckoning
me
to
unfading
happiness
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
stretched
out
his
arms
and
sprang
from
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
Before
his
frame
was
exposed
to
the
executioner
's
knife
,
life
was
totally
extinct
.

<EOS>
—
THE
LAST
EXECUTIONLittle
more
remains
to
be
told
,
and
that
little
is
of
an
equally
painful
nature
with
the
tragical
events
just
related
.
<EOS>
Fathers
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
,
together
with
Mr.
Abingdon
and
their
servants
,
arrived
in
London
on
the
12th
of
February
,
about
a
fortnight
after
the
execution
of
the
other
conspirators
.
<EOS>
They
were
first
taken
to
the
Gate
-
house
at
Westminster
,
and
were
examined
on
the
following
day
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
the
Privy
-
Council
at
the
Star
-
Chamber
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
elicited
from
them
,
and
Garnet
answered
the
Earl
's
interrogatories
with
infinite
subtlety
and
address
.
<EOS>
The
examination
over
,
they
were
ordered
to
be
removed
to
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
Topcliffe
accompanied
them
to
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
As
they
proceeded
thither
,
he
called
Garnet
's
attention
to
a
ghastly
object
stuck
on
a
spike
over
the
palace
gates
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
recognise
those
features
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
shudderingly
averting
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
"I
am
surprised
to
hear
it
,
"
rejoined
Topcliffe
,
"
for
they
were
once
well
known
to
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
head
of
Guy
Fawkes
.
<EOS>
Of
all
the
conspirators
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
,
"
he
was
the
only
one
who
died
truly
penitent
.
<EOS>
It
is
reported
that
this
happy
change
was
wrought
in
him
by
Viviana
Radcliffe
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
have
mercy
upon
his
soul
!
"
<EOS>
muttered
Garnet
.
<EOS>
"I
will
tell
you
a
strange
tale
about
Catesby
,
"
pursued
Topcliffe
.
"
<EOS>
He
was
buried
in
the
garden
at
Holbeach
with
Percy
,
but
an
order
was
sent
down
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
to
have
their
bodies
disinterred
and
quartered
.
<EOS>
When
Catesby
's
head
was
severed
from
the
trunk
,
to
be
set
on
the
gates
of
Warwick
,
fresh
blood
spouted
forth
,
as
if
life
were
in
the
veins
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
not
expect
me
to
believe
this
idle
story
?
"
said
Garnet
,
incredulously
.
<EOS>
"Believe
<EOS>
it
or
not
,
as
you
please
,
"
returned
Topcliffe
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
fortress
,
Garnet
was
lodged
in
the
large
chamber
of
the
Beauchamp
Tower
,
and
allowed
the
attendance
of
his
servant
,
Nicholas
Owen
,
while
Oldcorne
was
equally
well
accommodated
in
the
Constable
Tower
.
<EOS>
This
leniency
was
the
result
of
the
policy
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
who
hoped
to
obtain
disclosures
from
the
two
Jesuit
priests
which
would
enable
him
to
strike
the
decisive
blow
he
meditated
against
the
Papists
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
They
refused
to
make
any
confessions
which
would
criminate
themselves
,
or
implicate
others
;
and
as
none
of
the
conspirators
,
not
even
Tresham
,
had
admitted
their
connexion
with
the
plot
,
it
was
difficult
to
find
proof
against
them
.
<EOS>
Garnet
underwent
daily
examinations
from
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
and
the
commissioners
,
but
he
baffled
all
their
inquiries
.
<EOS>
"If
we
can
not
wring
the
truth
from
you
by
fair
means
,
Mr.
Garnet
,
"
said
Salisbury
,
"
we
must
have
recourse
to
torture
.
<EOS>
""Minare
<EOS>
ista
pueris
,
"
replied
Garnet
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"Leave
<EOS>
these
two
priests
to
me
,
my
lord
,
"
observed
Sir
William
Waad
,
who
was
present
at
the
examination
,
which
took
place
at
the
council
-
chamber
in
his
lodgings,—"leave
them
to
me
,
"
he
said
in
a
low
voice
to
the
Earl
,
"
and
I
will
engage
to
procure
a
full
confession
from
their
own
lips
,
without
resorting
to
torture
.
<EOS>
""You
will
render
the
state
an
important
service
by
doing
so
,
"
replied
Salisbury
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"
I
place
the
matter
entirely
in
your
hands
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
lieutenant
set
to
work
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
By
his
directions
,
Garnet
and
Oldcorne
were
removed
from
their
present
places
of
confinement
to
two
subterranean
cells
immediately
adjoining
each
other
,
but
between
which
a
secret
recess
,
contrived
in
the
thickness
of
the
wall
,
and
built
for
the
purpose
it
was
subsequently
put
to
,
existed
.
<EOS>
Two
days
after
they
had
been
so
immured
,
Ipgreve
,
who
had
received
his
instructions
,
loitered
for
a
moment
in
Oldcorne
's
cell
,
and
with
affected
hesitation
informed
him
that
for
a
trifling
reward
he
would
enable
him
to
hold
unreserved
communication
with
his
fellow
-
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Oldcorne
eagerly
caught
at
the
bait
,
but
required
to
be
satisfied
that
the
jailer
could
make
good
his
words
.
<EOS>
Ipgreve
immediately
proceeded
to
the
side
of
the
cell
,
and
holding
a
lamp
to
the
wall
,
showed
him
a
small
iron
knob
.
"Touch
<EOS>
this
spring
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
a
stone
will
fall
from
its
place
,
and
enable
you
to
converse
with
Father
Garnet
,
who
is
in
the
next
cell
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
take
care
to
replace
the
stone
when
any
one
approaches
.
<EOS>
"Promising
to
observe
the
utmost
caution
,
and
totally
unsuspicious
of
the
deceit
practised
upon
him
,
Oldcorne
gave
Ipgreve
the
reward
,
and
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
touched
the
spring
,
and
found
it
act
precisely
as
the
jailer
had
stated
.
<EOS>
Garnet
was
greatly
surprised
to
hear
the
other
's
voice
,
and
on
learning
how
the
communication
was
managed
was
at
first
suspicious
of
some
stratagem
,
but
by
degrees
his
fears
wore
off
,
and
he
became
unreserved
in
his
discourse
with
his
companion
,
discussing
the
fate
of
the
conspirators
,
their
own
share
in
the
plot
,
the
probability
of
their
acquittal
,
and
the
best
means
of
baffling
their
examiners
.
<EOS>
All
these
interlocutions
were
overheard
and
taken
down
by
the
lieutenant
and
two
other
witnesses
,
Forsett
and
Lockerson
,
private
secretary
to
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
who
were
concealed
in
the
recess
.
<EOS>
Having
obtained
all
the
information
he
desired
,
Sir
William
Waad
laid
his
notes
before
the
Council
,
and
their
own
confessions
being
read
to
the
priests
,
they
were
both
greatly
confused
,
though
neither
would
admit
their
authenticity
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
their
two
servants
,
Owen
and
Chambers
,
had
been
repeatedly
examined
,
and
refusing
to
confess
,
were
at
last
suspended
from
a
beam
by
the
thumbs
.
<EOS>
But
this
producing
no
result
,
they
were
told
that
on
the
following
day
they
would
be
placed
on
the
rack
.
<EOS>
Chambers
then
offered
to
make
a
full
confession
,
but
Owen
,
continuing
obstinate
,
was
conveyed
back
to
his
cell
.
<EOS>
Ipgreve
brought
him
his
food
as
usual
in
the
evening
,
and
on
this
occasion
,
it
consisted
of
broth
,
and
a
small
allowance
of
meat
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
custom
of
the
jailer
to
bring
with
him
a
small
blunt
-
pointed
knife
,
with
which
he
allowed
the
prisoner
to
cut
his
victuals
.
<EOS>
Having
got
possession
of
the
knife
,
Owen
tasted
the
broth
,
and
complaining
that
it
was
quite
cold
,
he
implored
the
jailer
to
get
it
warmed
for
him
,
as
he
felt
extremely
unwell
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
moved
by
his
entreaties
,
and
more
by
his
appearance
,
Ipgreve
complied
.
<EOS>
On
his
return
,
he
found
the
unfortunate
man
lying
in
one
corner
of
the
cell
,
partially
covered
by
a
heap
of
straw
which
ordinarily
formed
his
bed
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
your
broth
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Take
it
while
it
is
hot
.
<EOS>
I
shall
give
myself
no
further
trouble
about
you
.
<EOS>
""It
will
not
be
needed
,
"
gasped
Owen
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
the
sound
of
his
voice
,
Ipgreve
held
the
light
towards
him
,
and
perceived
that
his
face
was
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
remarked
that
the
floor
was
covered
with
blood
.
<EOS>
Instantly
divining
the
truth
,
the
jailer
rushed
towards
the
wretched
man
,
and
dragging
away
the
blood
-
stained
straw
,
found
he
had
inflicted
a
frightful
wound
upon
himself
with
the
knife
which
he
still
held
in
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"Fool
that
I
was
,
to
trust
you
with
the
weapon
!
"
cried
Ipgreve
.
"
<EOS>
But
who
would
have
thought
it
could
inflict
<EOS>
a
mortal
wound?""Any
weapon
will
serve
him
who
is
resolved
to
die
,
"
rejoined
Owen
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
not
put
me
on
the
rack
now
.
"
<EOS>
And
with
a
ghastly
expression
of
triumph
,
he
expired
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Oldcorne
and
Abingdon
were
sent
down
to
Worcester
,
where
the
former
was
tried
and
executed
.
<EOS>
Stephen
Littleton
suffered
death
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
On
Friday
,
the
23rd
of
March
,
full
proofs
being
obtained
against
him
,
Garnet
was
arraigned
of
high
treason
at
Guildhall
.
<EOS>
The
trial
,
which
excited
extraordinary
interest
,
was
attended
by
the
King
,
by
the
most
distinguished
personages
,
male
and
female
,
of
his
court
,
and
by
all
the
foreign
ambassadors
.
<EOS>
Garnet
conducted
himself
throughout
his
arraignment
,
which
lasted
for
thirteen
hours
,
with
the
same
courage
and
address
which
he
had
displayed
on
his
examinations
before
the
commissioners
.
<EOS>
But
his
subtlety
availed
him
little
.
<EOS>
He
was
found
guilty
and
condemned
.
<EOS>
The
execution
of
the
sentence
was
for
some
time
deferred
,
it
being
hoped
that
a
complete
admission
of
his
guilt
would
be
obtained
from
him
,
together
with
disclosures
relative
to
the
designs
of
the
Jesuit
party
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
the
examinations
were
still
continued
,
but
the
rigour
with
which
he
had
been
latterly
treated
was
relaxed
.
<EOS>
A
few
days
before
his
execution
,
he
was
visited
by
several
eminent
Protestant
Divines,—Doctor
Montague
,
Dean
of
the
Chapel
Royal
;
Doctor
Neile
,
Dean
of
Westminster
;
and
Doctor
Overall
,
Dean
of
Saint
Paul
's
;
with
whom
he
had
a
long
disputation
on
points
of
faith
and
other
spiritual
matters
.
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
this
discussion
,
Doctor
Overall
remarked
,
"
I
suppose
you
expect
,
Mr.
Garnet
,
that
after
your
death
,
the
Church
of
Rome
will
declare
you
a
martyr?""I
a
martyr
!
"
exclaimed
Garnet
,
sorrowfully
.
"
<EOS>
O
what
a
martyr
I
should
be
!
<EOS>
If
,
indeed
,
I
were
really
about
to
suffer
death
for
the
Catholic
religion
,
and
had
never
known
of
this
project
,
except
by
means
of
sacramental
confession
,
I
might
perhaps
be
accounted
worthy
the
honour
of
martyrdom
,
and
might
deservedly
be
glorified
in
the
opinion
of
our
church
.
<EOS>
As
it
is
,
I
acknowledge
myself
to
have
sinned
in
this
respect
,
and
deny
not
the
justice
of
the
sentence
passed
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"Satisfied
<EOS>
,
at
length
,
that
no
further
disclosures
could
be
obtained
from
him
,
the
King
signed
the
warrant
for
his
execution
on
the
2nd
of
May
.
<EOS>
The
scaffold
was
erected
at
the
west
end
of
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
on
the
spot
where
Digby
and
the
other
conspirators
had
suffered
.
<EOS>
A
vast
assemblage
was
collected
as
on
the
former
occasion
,
and
similar
precautions
were
taken
to
prevent
tumult
and
disturbance
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
man
's
torture
was
cruelly
and
unnecessarily
prolonged
by
a
series
of
questions
proposed
to
him
on
the
scaffold
by
Doctor
Overall
and
the
Dean
of
Westminster
,
all
of
which
he
answered
very
collectedly
and
clearly
.
<EOS>
He
maintained
his
fortitude
to
the
last
.
<EOS>
When
fully
prepared
,
he
mounted
the
ladder
,
and
thus
addressed
the
assemblage:—"I
commend
myself
to
all
good
Catholics
.
<EOS>
I
grieve
that
I
have
offended
the
King
by
not
revealing
the
design
entertained
against
him
,
and
that
I
did
not
use
more
diligence
in
preventing
the
execution
of
the
plot
.
<EOS>
I
commend
myself
most
humbly
to
the
lords
of
his
Majesty
's
council
,
and
entreat
them
not
to
judge
too
hardly
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
beseech
all
men
that
Catholics
may
not
fare
the
worse
for
my
sake
,
and
I
exhort
all
Catholics
to
take
care
not
to
mix
themselves
with
seditious
or
traitorous
designs
against
the
King
's
Majesty
,
whom
God
preserve!"Making
the
sign
of
the
cross
upon
his
forehead
and
breast
,
he
continued:"In
nomine
Patris
,
Filii
,
et
Spiritûs
Sancti
!
<EOS>
Jesus
Maria
!
<EOS>
Maria
,
mater
gratiæ

<EOS>
mater
misericordiæ

<EOS>
In
manus
tuas

Domine

commendo
spiritum

tu
redimisti
me

Domine

Deus

Again
crossing
himself
,
he
added,—"Per
crucis
hoc
signum
fugiat
procul
omne
malignum
!
<EOS>
Infige
crucem
tuam
,
Domine
,
in
corde
meo!"And
with
this
last
pathetic
ejaculation
he
threw
himself
from
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
Garnet
obtained
,
after
death
,
the
distinction
he
had
disclaimed
while
living
.
<EOS>
He
was
enrolled
,
together
with
Oldcorne
,
among
the
list
of
Catholic
martyrs
.
<EOS>
Several
miracles
are
affirmed
by
the
Jesuits
to
have
been
performed
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
Father
More
relates
that
on
the
lawn
at
Hendlip
,
where
he
and
Oldcorne
last
set
foot
,
"
a
new
and
hitherto
unknown
species
of
grass
sprang
up
into
the
exact
shape
of
an
imperial
crown
,
and
remained
for
a
long
time
without
being
trodden
down
by
the
feet
of
passengers
,
or
eaten
up
by
the
cattle
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
further
asserted
that
a
spring
of
oil
burst
forth
at
the
west
end
of
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
on
the
precise
spot
where
he
suffered
.
<EOS>
But
the
most
singular
prodigy
is
that
recounted
by
Endæmon
Joannes
,
who
affirms
that
in
a
straw
which
had
been
sprinkled
with
Garnet
's
blood
,
a
human
countenance
,
strangely
resembling
that
of
the
martyr
,
was
discovered
.
<EOS>
This
legend
of
the
Miraculous
Straw
,
having
received
many
embellishments
and
improvements
as
it
travelled
abroad
,
obtained
universal
credence
,
and
was
conceived
to
fully
establish
Garnet
's
innocence
.
<EOS>
Anne
Vaux
,
the
Jesuit
's
devoted
friend
,
retired
with
her
sister
,
Mrs.
Brooksby
,
to
a
nunnery
in
Flanders
,
where
she
ended
her
days
.
<EOS>
So
terminated
the
memorable
and
never
-
to
-
be
-
forgotten
Gunpowder
Treason
,
for
deliverance
from
which
our
church
still
offers
thanksgivings
,
and
in
remembrance
of
which
,
on
the
anniversary
of
its
discovery
,
fagots
are
collected
and
bonfires
lighted
to
consume
the
effigy
of
the
arch
-
conspirator
,
Guy
Fawkes
.
