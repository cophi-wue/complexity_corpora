<EOS>
RANDULPH
CREW.In
a
large
,
crazy
,
old
-
fashioned
house
at
the
corner
of
the
LittleSanctuary
in
Westminster
,
and
facing
the
abbey
,
dwelt
,
in
the
year
1774,a
person
named
Scarve
.
<EOS>
From
his
extraordinary
penurious
habits
,
hereceived
the
appellation
of
Starve
,
and
was
generally
denominated
by
hisneighbours
"
Miser
Starve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Few
,
if
any
,
of
those
who
thus
designatedhim
,
knew
much
about
him
,
none
of
them
being
allowed
to
cross
histhreshold
;
but
there
was
an
air
,
even
externally
,
about
his
dwelling
,
strongly
indicative
of
his
parsimonious
character
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
windowsin
the
upper
stories
,
which
,
as
is
usual
with
habitations
of
that
date
,
far
overhung
the
lower
,
were
boarded
up
,
and
those
not
thus
closed
wereso
covered
with
dust
and
dirt
that
it
was
impossible
to
discern
anyobject
through
them
.
<EOS>
Many
parts
of
the
building
were
in
a
ruinouscondition
,
and
where
the
dilapidations
were
not
dangerous
,
were
left
inthat
state
;
but
wherever
some
repairs
were
absolutely
necessary
to
keepthe
structure
together
,
they
were
made
in
the
readiest
and
cheapestmanner
.
<EOS>
The
porch
alone
preserved
its
original
character
.
<EOS>
It
projectedfar
beyond
the
doorway
,
and
was
ornamented
with
the
arms
of
a
formeroccupant
of
the
habitation
,
wrought
in
bold
relief
in
oak
,
and
supportedby
two
beautifully
-
carved
female
figures
.
<EOS>
All
the
lower
windows
werestrongly
grated
,
and
darkened
like
the
upper
with
long
-
accumulated
dust
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
kept
constantly
bolted
and
barred
,
even
in
the
day
-
time;and
the
whole
building
had
a
dingy
,
dismal
,
and
dungeon
-
like
aspect
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
's
opposite
neighbour
,
who
was
as
curious
as
oppositeneighbours
generally
are
,
and
who
was
a
mercer
named
Deacle
,
used
tospend
hours
with
his
wife
and
daughter
,
who
was
as
curious
as
himself
,
in
reconnoitring
the
miser
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
But
their
curiosity
was
rarely
,
if
ever
,
gratified
,
except
by
occasionally
seeing
some
member
of
thefamily
go
forth
,
or
return
.
<EOS>
Another
constant
spy
upon
the
mysteriousabode
was
Peter
Pokerich
,
a
young
barber
and
wig
-
maker
,
occupying
thenext
house
to
the
mercer
,
but
whose
motives
were
not
like
the
other's
,
entirely
those
of
curiosity
.
<EOS>
Having
completed
his
apprenticeship
about
atwelvemonth
before
,
Peter
Pokerich
had
at
that
time
settled
in
theLittle
Sanctuary
,
and
had
already
obtained
a
fair
share
of
business
,
being
much
employed
in
dressing
the
wigs
of
the
lawyers
frequentingWestminster
Hall
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
smart
dapper
little
fellow
,
with
nocontemptible
opinion
of
himself
,
either
as
to
mental
or
personalqualifications
,
and
being
determined
to
push
his
fortune
with
the
sex
,
had
,
in
the
first
instance
,
paid
very
marked
attentions
to
the
mercer'sdaughter
,
Thomasine
,
or
,
as
she
was
more
familiarly
called
,
Tommy
;
andthese
attentions
it
was
pretty
evident
were
not
altogether
unacceptable
.
<EOS>
Just
,
however
,
as
he
was
on
the
eve
of
declaring
himself
and
solicitingthe
hand
of
the
fair
Thomasine
,
with
little
apprehension
of
a
refusal
,
he
accidentally
beheld
the
miser
's
daughter
,
Hilda
Scarve
,
and
hisinflammable
heart
taking
fire
at
her
beauty
,
which
was
sufficientlyravishing
to
captivate
a
colder
breast
than
the
barber
's
,
he
thenceforthbecame
her
slave
,
and
could
no
longer
endure
the
auburn
locks
,
the
hazelorbs
,
the
round
cheeks
,
and
plump
little
person
,
of
the
fair
Thomasine
,
which
had
once
appeared
so
attractive
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Another
considerationwas
not
without
its
weight
in
turning
the
scale
of
his
affections
.
<EOS>
Hilda
's
father
was
reputed
to
be
of
immense
wealth
;
she
was
his
onlychild
,
at
least
it
was
generally
understood
to
be
so
,
and
would
,
ofcourse
,
inherit
the
whole
of
his
vast
hoards
;
and
as
,
furthermore
,
hewas
an
old
man
,
it
could
not
,
in
the
course
of
nature
,
be
very
longbefore
the
property
must
come
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
consideration
decided
Peterin
favour
of
the
miser
's
daughter
,
and
it
was
the
hope
of
obtaining
aglimpse
of
her
that
made
him
play
the
spy
upon
her
father
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
The
repairs
previously
alluded
to
were
made
by
the
miser
's
servant
,
Jacob
Post
,
who
,
on
this
occasion
,
stepped
over
the
way
to
borrow
aladder
from
Mr.
Deacle
.
<EOS>
For
reasons
of
his
own
,
the
mercer
readilycomplied
with
the
request
,
and
when
Jacob
's
work
was
done
,
and
hebrought
back
the
ladder
,
he
was
invited
by
its
owner
to
his
backparlour
,
where
Mrs.
Deacle
and
the
fair
Thomasine
were
seated
,
and
wherea
substantial
repast
was
laid
out
.
<EOS>
Jacob
was
next
requested
to
sit
down
,
and
with
some
hesitation
complied
.
<EOS>
A
plate
,
loaded
with
cold
beef
,
wasnext
offered
him
,
and
he
cleared
it
in
an
inconceivably
short
space
oftime
.
<EOS>
The
plate
was
again
filled
,
and
again
emptied
,
and
as
his
appetiteseemed
in
no
ways
stayed
,
and
the
edge
-
bone
was
nearly
bared
,
a
largeremnant
of
a
potato
pie
in
a
brown
earthenware
dish
was
substituted
.
<EOS>
To
the
astonishment
of
the
party
,
he
soon
disposed
of
it
.
<EOS>
These
viandsrequiring
to
be
washed
down
,
Mr.
Deacle
took
a
jug
of
ale
,
which
stoodat
one
corner
of
the
table
,
and
pouring
out
a
large
foaming
glass
,
offered
it
to
his
guest
,
winking
as
he
did
so
at
his
wife
,
as
much
as
tosay
,
"
We
have
him
now
.
<EOS>
"
Whether
or
not
Jacob
saw
the
wink
is
of
littleimport
.
<EOS>
He
took
the
glass
,
drained
it
to
the
last
drop
,
and
sprang
tohis
feet
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
you
're
not
going
!
"
cried
Mr.
Deacle
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
I
am
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
in
a
deep
,
gruff
voice
.
<EOS>
"Well
;
but
stop
a
bit
,
I
've
something
to
say
to
you
,
"
rejoined
Mr
.
Deacle
.
<EOS>
"Master'll
<EOS>
wonder
what
I
'm
doing
here
so
long
,
"
returned
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
Hewatched
me
cross
over
with
the
ladder
.
<EOS>
""You
should
have
thought
of
that
before
you
sat
down
,
"
remarked
Mrs
.
Deacle
,
somewhat
spitefully
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
would
draw
another
jug
of
ale
,
mydear
,
I
dare
say
Jacob
would
risk
incurring
his
master
's
displeasure
,
and
stay
a
few
minutes
longer
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
would
n't
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
looking
at
the
same
time
wistfully
atthe
jug
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
I
would
n't
,
"
he
added
,
slightly
softening
his
tone
.
<EOS>
"Try
<EOS>
him
,
"
whispered
Mrs.
Deacle
to
her
spouse
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
Deacle
took
the
hint
,
and
likewise
took
up
the
jug
,
and
winking
athis
wife
,
proceeded
to
a
side
door
,
opening
upon
a
flight
of
stonesteps
,
evidently
leading
to
the
lower
part
of
the
premises
,
anddisappeared
.
<EOS>
With
true
feminine
tact
,
Mrs.
Deacle
had
perceived
Jacob'sweak
point
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
spell
-
bound
.
<EOS>
The
temptation
of
the
'
other
jug
'
wasirresistible
.
<EOS>
He
scratched
his
forehead
with
the
point
of
his
greatthumb
-
nail
,
pushed
the
little
brown
scratch
wig
covering
the
top
of
hishead
still
higher
up
,
glanced
at
the
door
,
but
did
not
attempt
towithdraw
.
<EOS>
The
figure
that
he
now
cut
was
so
ridiculous
that
both
ladiesburst
into
screams
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
Not
in
the
slightest
degreedisconcerted
,
Jacob
maintained
his
position
,
and
eyed
them
with
a
lookso
stern
that
their
merriment
speedily
died
off
in
a
quaver
.
<EOS>
TheFormidable
certainly
predominated
over
the
Ridiculous
in
Jacob'sappearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
six
feet
two
in
height
,
with
a
large
-
boned
frame
,
notencumbered
with
too
much
flesh
,
and
immense
hands
and
feet
.
<EOS>
Thoughslightly
in
-
kneed
,
he
held
himself
as
erect
as
an
old
soldier
.
<EOS>
He
had
agrim
black
muzzle
,
a
wide
mouth
garnished
with
keen
white
teeth
,
themasticatory
powers
of
which
he
had
so
satisfactorily
exhibited
,
thickand
jetty
eyebrows
,
and
an
enormous
nose
slightly
tinged
towards
itsextremity
with
a
mulberry
hue
.
<EOS>
He
wore
an
old
gray
cloth
coat
,
of
theformal
cut
,
in
vogue
about
twenty
years
before
,
with
a
row
of
platebuttons
extending
from
the
collar
to
the
skirts
,
as
well
as
<EOS>
others
onthe
pockets
,
and
which
coat
,
though
it
only
reached
to
his
knees
,
musthave
dangled
down
to
its
original
owner
's
ankles
.
<EOS>
His
waistcoat
was
ofthe
same
material
as
the
upper
garment
,
and
evidently
dated
back
to
thesame
remote
period
.
<EOS>
A
dirty
neckcloth
,
which
looked
positively
whitefrom
its
contrast
with
his
swarthy
chin
,
was
twisted
round
his
throat
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
great
personal
strength
,
and
,
indeed
,
was
reported
to
havedriven
off
,
single
-
handed
,
three
housebreakers
,
who
had
contrived
onenight
to
effect
an
entrance
into
his
master
's
habitation
.
<EOS>
It
was
thoughtthat
the
miser
retained
him
as
much
for
self
-
defence
as
for
his
otherservices
;
and
it
was
even
said
that
in
some
money
-
lending
transactionsin
which
Mr.
Scarve
had
been
engaged
with
suspicious
characters
,
Jacobstood
by
on
guard
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
mercer
had
returned
with
a
jug
,
whose
frothing
headmade
Jacob
smack
his
lips
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
effect
produced
on
him
,
Mr.
Deacleindulged
in
a
sly
chuckle
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
Jacob
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
feigned
commiserating
tone
,
"
I
fear
you
don'tget
such
liquor
as
this
with
your
master
.
<EOS>
He
do
n't
brew
over
strong
--
nottoo
much
malt
and
hops
<EOS>
,
eh?""That
's
true
enough
,
Sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
get
any
ale
at
all
,
Jacob
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Mrs.
Deacle
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
in
a
tone
so
abrupt
that
it
made
the
good
damestart
,
and
elicited
a
slight
scream
from
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"Odd
's
precious
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Deacle
;
"
how
the
fellow
does
frightenone
.
<EOS>
And
so
you
have
no
ale?"--(Jacob
shook
his
head)--"norsmall
-
beer?"--(another
negative)--"then
<EOS>
what
do
you
drink
,
for
wine
orspirits
must
be
out
of
the
question?""Treacle
-
beer
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
"
and
little
enough
of
that
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
should
think
,
"
remarked
Mr.
Deacle
,
cunningly
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
friendJacob,--this
may
be
very
well
for
your
master
,
but
it
wo
nt
do
with
me
.
<EOS>
Your
nose
would
never
keep
its
goodly
colour
on
such
thin
potations
.
<EOS>
"A
grim
smile
crossed
Jacob
's
face
,
and
he
tapped
the
feature
inquestion
.
<EOS>
"I
understand
,
"
replied
the
mercer
,
winking
;
"

Jacob

<EOS>
Your

"
replied
Jacob
,
after
tossing
off
the
glass
;
"
he
doesn'tlive
like
a

<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
I
differ
from
you
,
"
returned
the
mercer
,
"
he
lives
like
a
miser
,
and
misers
are
always
rich

<EOS>
""Maybe

"
replied
Jacob
,
turning
away
.
<EOS>
"Stop

cried
the
ironmonger
,
"
you

replied
Jacob

looking
as

not
relishthe
question

"

there
's
sometimes
a

the

<EOS>
""Do

<EOS>
ejaculated
Mrs

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dreadful!""Dreadful
!
<EOS>
indeed

"
echoed
Thomasine
,
with
an
expression
of
ineffabledisgust

theatrically
fine
in
its

<EOS>
"Well

I

pursued
Mrs.

"You

he
answered
drily
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
the

ill

treat

said
Thomasine

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poorthing

I

her

gruffly

""Don't

Jacob

interposed
the

pouring
out

handing
it

him

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Women

added
Thomasine

Jacob

""I

<EOS>
Jacob
looked
as
though
he
wouldhave
said
,
"
What
's
that
to
you

"
<EOS>
but
he
answered
,
"
Mrs.

<EOS>
""You'll
think
me
rather
curious

Jacob

pursued
the

What
is
it

replied
Jacob

"Hilda

cried
Mrs.

<EOS>
"Singular

indeed

sweetly
pretty

sighed
Thomasine

<EOS>
"Probably

a

remarked
the

"
<EOS>
Well

""She

repeated
Jacob

emphatically
.
<EOS>
"Not

very
well
dressed
though

"
muttered
the
mercer
,
as
if
speaking
tohimself
;
and
then
he
added
aloud--"She'll

Jacob

bursting

<EOS>
""Peter

screamed
Thomasine

starting
to
her

assumingan
attitude
of
distraction

"Mercy

what

cried
the
mercer
,
in
surprise

<EOS>
"Don't

"
rejoined
the
young
lady
,
gasping
like
a
tragicactress
,
and
passing
her
hand
across
her
brow
as
if
to
clear
off
someimaginary
hair

her
own
auburn
tresses
being
trimly
secured

little

catching

""I've
nothing
more
to

replied
Jacob
,
who
listened
withimperturbable
calmness
to
this
passionate
and
touching
address.--"He

""But

<EOS>
cried
Thomasine
,
breathlessly
.
"Not

the

replied
Jacob
,
"
and
then
he
stopped
her
justas
she
was
entering
the
house
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
I
was
there
,
and
I
gave
him
ataste
of
my
crabstick

which
I
'll
engage

'll
remember

<EOS>
""Cudgelled!--Peter

false

criedThomasine

relaxing
her

staggering
back

""What

the

<EOS>
"Fetch

the

my

replied
his
wife

<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
you
see
there
's
been
a
secret
attachment

<EOS>
"
she
added
,
in
an
undertone
;
"
that
deceitful
little
barber
has
played
her
false

But
I
'll
bringhim
to

warrant
him

Poor

<EOS>
The

<EOS>
the
ratafia!--quick

<EOS>
quick!"The
mercer
open
a
cupboard
,
took
out
the
cordial
,
gave
it
to
his
wife
,
and
then
motioning
to
Jacob
to
follow
him
,
rushed
so
precipitately
outof
the
room
that
he
overset
a
person
who
was
listening
at
the
door
,
andwho
proved
to
be
no
other
than
Peter
Pokerich
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
you
here
,
sir
!
"
cried
Mr.
Deacle
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Then
you
haveheard
what
has
passed
.
<EOS>
Go
in
to
my
daughter
,
and
make
her
mind
easydirectly
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
he
does
n't
I
'll
give
him
another
taste
of
the
crabstick
,
"
saidJacob
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
it
would
be
highly
indecorous
,
improper
,
in
me
to
go
in
just
now
,
Mr
.
Deacle
,
"
remonstrated
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
more
indecorous
than
listening
at
the
door
,
"
rejoined
the
mercer
.
<EOS>
"Go
<EOS>
in
directly
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
go
!
"
<EOS>
added
Jacob
.
<EOS>
And
Peter
,
seeing
that
opposition
was
in
vain
,
opened
the
door
andsneaked
in
.
<EOS>
A
stifled
scream
and
an
hysterical
laugh
succeeded
hisentrance
.
<EOS>
The
mercer
accompanied
Jacob
to
the
street
door
;
and
,
as
he
passedthrough
the
shop
,
pointed
out
the
different
rich
stuffs
to
him
.
<EOS>
"I
wish
you
could
induce
your
young
mistress
to
come
and
look
at
myassortment
of
stuffs
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
it
is
the
choicest
in
town
,
though
Isay
it

who
should
not
say
it

<EOS>

Can

Jacob
.
<EOS>
"I
would
send
her
some
stuffs
to
look
at
,
if
you
think
her
fatherwouldn't
object
,
"
said
the
mercer
:
"
this
black
velvet
would
suit
herexactly
;
or
this
rich
Italian
silk
.
<EOS>
""It
would
cost
me
my
place
to
take
them
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
"
and
<EOS>
yet
,
asyou
say
,
they
would
become
her
purely

<EOS>
But
it
's
of
no

thinking
ofthem

"
he
added
,
walking
away
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
word
more
,
Jacob
,
"
said
Mr.
Deacle
,
detaining
him
,
and
whisperingin
his
ear--"I
did
not
like
to
ask
the
questions
before
the
women

--
butthey
do
say
your
master
's
a
Papist
and
a
Jacobite
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
say
so
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
,
loudly
and
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Speak
up
,
and
tell
me!""Why
,
the
neighbours
,
"
replied
the
mercer
,
somewhat
abashed
.
<EOS>
"Then
tell
'em
from
me
that
it
's
a
lie
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
.
<EOS>
And
,
heedlessof
any
further
attempts
to
detain
him
,
he
strode
away
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
about
a
month
after
the
incident
above
related
,
which
tookplace
at
the
latter
end
of
April
,
1774
,
just
as
Peter
Pokerich
was
inthe
act
of
shutting
up
his
shop
,
he
observed
a
horseman
turn
out
ofKing
-
street
,
and
ride
towards
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
sufficiently
light
to
enablehim
to
discover
,
on
a
nearer
approach
,
that
the
stranger
was
a
youngman
,
about
one
or
two
and
twenty
,
with
a
tall
,
well
-
proportioned
figure
,
at
once
vigorous
and
symmetrical
,
extremely
regular
and
finely
formedfeatures
,
glowing
with
health
and
manly
beauty
,
and
slightly
,
though
notunbecomingly
,
embrowned
by
exposure
to
the
sun
.
<EOS>
Apparently
disdaining
tofollow
the
fashion
of
the
period
,
or
proud
of
his
own
waving
,
brownlocks
,
the
young
man
suffered
them
to
fall
in
their
native
luxurianceover
his
shoulders
.
<EOS>
The
fashion
of
his
dark
green
riding
-
dress
--
which
,
illmade
as
it
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
the
knowing
barber
,
revealed
hisfine
figure
to
great
advantage
,
as
well
as
,
his
generalappearance
--
proclaimed
him
from
the
country
.
<EOS>
Looking
hard
at
Peter
as
headvanced
,
the
stranger
drew
up
beside
him
.
<EOS>
"Can
<EOS>
you
tell
me
where
Mr.
Scarve
lives
,
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
Peter
started
,
and
stared
at
his
interrogator
in
speechlessastonishment
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
looked
surprised
in
his
turn
,
and
repeatedthe
inquiry
.
<EOS>
"Miser
<EOS>
Scarve
--

pardon

<EOS>
Mr

Peter

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

""Then

<EOS>
the

<EOS>
"
This

Scarve?""My

rejoined
the
young

somewhat
coldly

haughtily

it
refers
to
Mr.

himself

<EOS>
""Beg

no

returned
Peter

in

Mr.

,
friend
<EOS>
;
I
am
content
with
the
covering
nature
has
given
tomy
head
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
very
good
reason
,
sir
,
"
replied
Peter
;
"
but
fashion
,
sir,--fashion
is
arbitrary
,
and
has
decreed
that
no
man
shall
wear
hisown
hair
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
you
must
,
perforce
,
adopt
the
perriwig
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
shew
me
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
's
residence
,
or
must
I
apply
forinformation
elsewhere
?
"
cried
the
young
man
,
wearied
with
the
barber'sloquacity
.
"Not
<EOS>
so
fast
sir
,
not
so
fast
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
tell
yousomething
about
the
old
gentleman
first
.
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
,
sir?"Randulph
Crew
uttered
a
hasty
negative
.
"
<EOS>
Then
I
do
,
"
continued
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Terrible
<EOS>
miser
,
sir
,
terrible
;
denies
himself
all
the
comforts
ofexistence
;
makes
his
family
and
servants
live
upon
a
bare
bone
for
aweek
;
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
gold
;
and
as
to
his
daughter--""Oh
,
he
has
a
daughter
,
has
he
?
"
<EOS>
interrupted
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
not
awareof
it
.
<EOS>
Is
she
at
all
like
him?""Like
him
,
no
!
"
echoed
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
She
's
beautiful
beyond
description
.
"
<EOS>
Butthinking
such
commendation
rather
injudicious
in
the
present
case
,
headded
,
"
at
least
some
people
say
so
,
but
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
seenothing
to
admire
in
her
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
perhaps
I
may
see
her
,
and
judge
for
myself
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Perhaps
<EOS>
you
may
,
"
quavered
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
just
the
man
to
captivateher
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
could
misdirect
him
.
<EOS>
But
most
probably
Jacobwont
admit
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
now
,
friend
,
will
you
shew
me
the
house
?
"
cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"With
pleasure
,
sir
,
with
pleasure
,
"
replied
Peter
,
pointing
to
theopposite
habitation
;
"
<EOS>
there
it
is,--at
the
corner
.
"Vexed
<EOS>
at
having
been
detained
so
long
and
so
unnecessarily
,
RandulphCrew
turned
his
horse
's
head
,
and
,
dismounting
before
the
miser
's
door
,
knocked
loudly
against
it
with
the
butt
-
end
of
his
heavy
riding
-
whip
.
<EOS>
Peter
anxiously
watched
his
proceedings
,
but
as
no
answer
was
returnedto
the
summons
,
he
began
to
hope
the
young
man
would
go
away
.
<EOS>
But
inthis
he
was
disappointed
,
for
the
latter
renewed
his
application
,
anddid
not
desist
till
checked
by
the
gruff
voice
of
Jacob
Post
,
whoshouted
from
a
little
grated
window
,
through
which
he
reconnoitred
theintruder
,
"
Halloo
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
?
<EOS>
who
's
there?""Is
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
at
home
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
want
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
ca
n't
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
in
his
harshest
accents
,
but
whichsounded
like
music
in
the
ears
of
the
attentive
Peter
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
must
,
and
will
see
him
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
in
a
peremptory
tone
.
<EOS>
"I
have
a
packet
to
deliver
to
him
--
to
his
own
hands
--
an
importantpacket
.
<EOS>
Tell
him
that
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
Jacobite
,
I
'll
be
sworn
,
"
cried
Peter
to
himself
;
"
I
must
watch
himnarrowly
.
<EOS>
I
should
feel
gratified
in
being
the
means
of
hanging
thatyoung
man
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
'll
take
your
message
to
my
master
,
"
growled
Jacob
,
after
ashort
pause
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
scrutinize
you
a
little
before
I
admit
you
.
<EOS>
Youseem
to
me
,
so
far
as
I
can
make
out
,
to
have
a
good
deal
of
the
cut
ofa
highwayman
about
you
.
<EOS>
""He
,
he
,
he
!
<EOS>
good
,
Jacob
,
good
!
"
tittered
Peter
.
<EOS>
Some
minutes
elapsed
before
Jacob
,
who
had
disappeared
,
returned
.
<EOS>
Aheavy
tread
was
heard
along
the
passage
leading
to
the
door
,
succeededby
the
rattling
of
a
chain
,
the
clanking
of
bars
,
and
the
shooting
backof
a
couple
of
ponderous
bolts
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
then
thrown
open
,
andexhibited
the
great
gaunt
figure
of
Jacob
,
holding
a
lantern
in
onehand
,
the
light
of
which
he
threw
full
upon
the
face
of
the
young
man
,
while
he
kept
the
other
hand
,
which
grasped
the
redoubted
crabstick
,
outof
view
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
,
at
length
,
with
the
investigation
,
he
growled
forth,"It'll
do
.
<EOS>
Master'll
see
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
come
in
.
<EOS>
""That
for
your
trouble
,
friend
,
"
said
Randulph
,
slipping
a
crown
intoJacob
's
hand
,
as
he
tied
his
horse
's
bridle
to
a
ring
in
the
door
-
post
.
<EOS>
"I
wonder
what
this
is
given
for
?
"
<EOS>
muttered
Jacob
,
as
he
pocketed
thecoin
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
the
only
suspicious
thing
I
've
noticed
about
him
.
<EOS>
I
mustkeep
an
eye
upon
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
dare
say
he
only
wants
to
see
my
youngmistress
,
and
she
's
worth
more
than
twenty
crowns
to
look
at
.
<EOS>
"Thus
ruminating
,
he
admitted
Randulph
into
the
passage
,
locked
andbolted
the
door
,
took
the
light
out
of
the
lantern
and
placed
it
in
acopper
candle
-
stick
,
and
led
the
way
towards
a
back
room
.
<EOS>
While
the
door
was
being
fastened
,
Peter
Pokerich
darted
across
the
way
,
shouting
to
Randulph
,
"
I
'll
take
care
of
your
horse
,
sir
.
"
<EOS>
No
attention
,
however
,
being
paid
to
the
offer
,
he
hurried
back
for
a
light
,
and
begancarefully
to
examine
the
saddle
,
peering
into
the
holsters
,
and
tryingto
open
the
saddle
-
bags
,
to
see
whether
he
could
obtain
any
clue
to
thesupposed
Jacobite
principles
of
the
owner

CHAPTER
II.--THE
MISER
AND
HIS
DAUGHTER
<EOS>
--
RANDULPH
DELIVERS
THE
PACKAGE
TO
THEFORMER
--
<EOS>
ITS
<EOS>
RECEPTION.Meanwhile
,
as
Randulph
Crew
followed
his
conductor
along
the
passage
,
the
boards
of
which
,
being
totally
destitute
of
carpet
or
cloth
,
soundedhollowly
beneath
their
feet
;
as
he
glanced
at
the
bare
walls
,
the
dustyand
cobweb
-
festooned
ceiling
,
and
the
staircase
,
as
devoid
of
coveringas
<EOS>
the
passage
,
he
could
not
but
admit
that
the
account
given
him
by
thebarber
of
Mr.
Scurve
's
miserly
habits
was
not
exaggerated
.
<EOS>
Little
time
,
however
,
was
allowed
,
him
for
reflection
.
<EOS>
Jacob
marched
quickly
in
,
andpushing
open
a
door
on
the
right
,
ushered
him
into
his
master'spresence
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
was
an
old
man
,
and
looked
much
older
than
he
reallywas,--being
only
sixty
-
five
,
whereas
he
appeared
like
eighty
.
<EOS>
His
framewas
pinched
,
as
if
by
self
-
denial
,
and
preternaturally
withered
andshrivelled
;
and
there
was
a
thin
,
haggard
,
and
almost
hungry
look
<EOS>
abouthis
face
,
extremely
painful
to
contemplate
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
stronglymarked
,
and
sharp
,
and
his
eye
gray
,
keen
,
and
piercing
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressedin
a
threadbare
cloth
robe
,
trimmed
with
sable
,
and
wore
a
velvetnightcap
,
lined
with
cotton
,
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
his
habilimentswere
darned
and
patched
in
an
unseemly
manner
.
<EOS>
He
was
seated
near
asmall
table
,
on
which
was
laid
a
ragged
and
dirty
cloth
,
covered
withthe
remains
of
his
scanty
meal
,
which
Randulph
's
arrival
hadinterrupted
.
<EOS>
Part
of
a
stale
loaf
,
a
slice
of
cheese
,
and
a
little
salt
,
constituted
the
sum
total
of
the
repast
.
<EOS>
Everything
in
the
room
bespokethe
character
of
its
owner
.
<EOS>
The
panelled
walls
were
without
hangings
ordecoration
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
The
room
itself
,
it
was
evident
,
had
knownbetter
days
and
richer
garniture
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
,
but
handsome
in
itscharacter
,
and
boasted
a
large
and
well
-
carved
chimney
-
piece
,
and
awindow
filled
with
stained
glass
,
displaying
the
armorial
bearings
ofthe
former
possessor
of
the
house
,
though
now
patched
in
many
placeswith
paper
,
and
stopped
up
in
others
with
old
rags
.
<EOS>
This
window
wasstrongly
grated
,
and
the
bars
were
secured
in
their
turn
by
a
largepadlock
placed
inside
the
room
.
<EOS>
Over
the
chimney
-
piece
there
were
placeda
couple
of
large
blue
and
white
china
bottles
with
dried
everlastingflowers
stuck
in
their
necks
.
<EOS>
There
were
only
two
chairs
in
the
room
,
and
a
stool
.
<EOS>
The
best
chair
was
appropriated
by
the
miser
himself
.
<EOS>
Itwas
an
old
-
fashioned
affair
,
with
great
wooden
arms
,
and
a
hard
leathernback
,
polished
like
a
well
-
blacked
shoe
by
frequent
use
.
<EOS>
A
few
coals
,
carefully
piled
into
a
little
pyramid
,
burnt
within
the
bars
,
as
if
toshew
the
emptiness
of
the
grate
,
and
diffused
a
slight
gleam
,
like
ahollow
laugh
,
but
no
sort
of
heat
.
<EOS>
Beside
it
sat
Mrs.
Clinton
,
anelderly
maiden
lady
,
almost
as
wintry
-
looking
,
and
as
pinched
as
herbrother
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
This
antiquated
lady
had
a
long
thin
neck
,
a
large
nose
,
very
,
very
retroussee
,
and
a
skin
yellow
as
parchment
;
but
theexpression
of
her
countenance
,
though
rather
sharp
and
frosty
,
waskindly
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
close
-
fitting
gown
of
dark
camlet
,
with
short
tightsleeves
,
that
by
no
means
concealed
the
angularities
of
her
figure
.
<EOS>
Herhair
,
which
was
still
dark
as
in
her
youth
,
was
gathered
up
closelybehind
,
and
was
surmounted
by
the
small
muslin
cap
then
in
vogue
.
<EOS>
The
object
,
however
,
that
chiefly
rivetted
Randulph
's
attention
on
hisentrance
was
neither
the
miser
himself
,
nor
his
sister
-
in
-
law
,
but
hisdaughter
.
<EOS>
Her
beauty
was
so
extraordinary
that
it
acted
like
a
surpriseupon
him
,
occasioning
a
thrill
of
delight
,
mingled
with
a
feeling
ofembarrassment
.
<EOS>
She
had
risen
as
he
entered
the
room
,
and
gracefully
,
andwith
much
natural
dignity
,
returned
his
salutation
,
which
,
throughinadvertence
,
he
addressed
almost
exclusively
to
her
.
<EOS>
Hilda
Scarve
's
agemight
be
guessed
at
nineteen
.
<EOS>
She
was
tall
,
exquisitely
proportioned
,
with
a
pale
,
clear
complexion
,
set
off
by
her
rich
raven
tresses
,
which
,
totally
unrestrained
,
showered
down
in
a
thick
cloud
over
her
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
large
,
and
dark
,
luminous
but
steady
,
and
indicatedfirmness
of
character
.
<EOS>
Her
look
was
grave
and
sedate
,
and
there
wasgreat
determination
in
her
beautifully
formed
but
closely
shut
lips
.
<EOS>
Both
her
aspect
and
deportment
exhibited
the
most
perfect
self
-
command
,
and
whatever
effect
might
be
produced
upon
her
by
the
sudden
entrance
ofthe
handsome
visitor
,
not
a
glance
was
suffered
to
reveal
it
,
while
he
,
on
the
contrary
,
could
not
repress
the
admiration
excited
by
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
;
speedily
recalled
to
himself
by
the
miser
,
who
rappingthe
table
impatiently
,
exclaimed
in
a
querulous
tone
,
"
Your
business
,
sir?--your
business?""I
have
come
to
deliver
this
to
you
,
sir
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
producing
asmall
packet
,
and
handing
it
to
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
tell
you
,
sir
,
"
headded
in
a
voice
of
emotion
,
"
that
it
was
my
father
's
wish
that
thispacket
should
be
given
to
you
a
year
after
his
death
,
but
not
before
.
""And
<EOS>
your
father
's
name
,
"
cried
the
miser
,
bending
eagerly
forward
,
andshading
his
eyes
so
as
to
enable
him
to
see
the
young
man
moredistinctly
,
"
was
--
was--""The
same
as
my
own
,
Randulph
Crew
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"Gracious
heaven
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
miser
,
falling
back
in
his
chair
,
"
andhe
is
dead?--my
friend
--
my
old
friend
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
pressed
his
hand
to
hisface
,
as
if
to
hide
his
agony
.
<EOS>
Hilda
bent
anxiously
over
him
,
and
tried
to
soothe
him
,
but
he
pushedher
gently
away
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
discharged
my
mission
<EOS>
,
I
will
now
take
my
leave
,
"
said
Randulph
,
after
a
slight
pause
,
during
which
he
looked
on
in
silent
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"I
will
call
at
some
other
time
,
Miss
Scarve
,
to
speak
to
your
fatherrespecting
the
packet
.
<EOS>
""No
,
stay
,
"
cried
Hilda
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Some
old
and
secret
spring
ofaffection
has
been
touched
.
<EOS>
I
entreat
you
to
wait
till
he
recovers
.
<EOS>
Hewill
be
better
presently
.
<EOS>
""He
is
better
now
;
"
replied
the
miser
,
uncovering
his
face
,
"
the
fit
ispast;--but
<EOS>
it
was
sharp
while
it
lasted
.
<EOS>
Randulph
Crew
,
"
he
addedfaintly
,
and
stretching
out
his
thin
hand
to
him
,
"
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Years
ago
,
I
knew
your
father
well
.
<EOS>
But
unhappy
circumstances
separatedus
,
and
since
then
I
have
seen
nothing
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
fancied
him
alive
,
andwell
,
and
happy
,
and
your
sudden
announcement
of
his
death
gave
me
agreat
shock
.
<EOS>
Your
father
was
a
good
man
,
Randulph
,
a
good
man
,
and
akind
one
.
<EOS>
""He
was
indeed
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
young
man
,
in
a
broken
voice
,
thetears
starting
to
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
somewhat
careless
in
money
matters
,
Randulph
;
thoughtless
andextravagant
,
"
pursued
the
miser
.
"
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
mean
nothing
disrespectful
tohis
memory
,
"
he
added
,
perceiving
the
young
man
's
colour
heighten
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hisfaults
were
those
of
an
over
-
generous
nature
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
man
's
enemy
buthis
own
.
<EOS>
He
once
had
a
fine
property
,
but
,
I
fear
,
he
dissipated
it
.
<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
all
events
,
he
greatly
embarrassed
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
man;"and
<EOS>
,
I
lament
to
say
,
that
the
situation
of
his
affairs
preyed
upon
hisspirits
,
and
no
doubt
hastened
his
end
.
<EOS>
""I
feared
it
would
be
so
,
"
said
the
miser
,
shaking
his
head
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
theestates
were
entailed
.
<EOS>
They
are
yours
now
,
and
unembarrassed
.
<EOS>
""They
might
have
been
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
man
;
"
but
I
haveforegone
the
advantage
I
could
have
taken
of
my
father
's
creditors
,
andhave
placed
the
estates
in
their
hands
,
and
for
their
benefit
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
n't
mean
to
say
you
have
been
guilty
of
such
incredible
folly
,
for
I
can
call
it
nothing
else

"
cried
the
miser
,
in
a
sharp
and
angrytone
,
and
starting
to
his
feet
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
give
the
estate
to
the
very
menwho
ruined
your
father
!
<EOS>
Have
you
been
rash
and
unadvised
enough
to
breakdown
the
barriers
that
the
law
had
built
around
you
for
your
protection
,
and
let
in
the
enemy
into
the
very
heart
of
the
citadel
.
<EOS>
It
is
theheight
of
folly,--of
madness
I
should
say
.
<EOS>
""Folly
or
not
,
sir
,
"
returned
the
young
man
haughtily
,
"
<EOS>
I
do
not
repentthe
step
I
have
taken
.
<EOS>
My
first
consideration
was
to
preserve
the
memoryof
my
father
unblemished
.
<EOS>
""Unblemished
,
pshaw
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
You
would
have
cleared
the
spotsfrom
your
father
's
fair
name
much
more
effectually
if
you
had
kept
fasthold
of
the
estates
,
instead
of
reducing
yourself
to
the
condition
of
abeggar
.
<EOS>
""Father
,
"
exclaimed
Hilda
,
uneasily
,
"
father
,
you
speak
toostrongly
--
much
too
strongly
.
<EOS>
""I
am
no
beggar
,
Sir

"
replied
Randulph
,
with
difficulty
repressing
hisanger
,
"
nor
will
I
allow
such
a
term
to
be
applied
to
me
by
you

anyman

<EOS>
Farewell

sir

<EOS>
"
And
he
would
have
left
the
room
,
if
he
had
not
beendetained
by
the
imploring
looks
of
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
then
,
you
are
reduced
to
the
condition
of
a
poor
man
,
if
youprefer
the
term
,
and
therefore
must
be
a
dependent
one
,
"
said
the
miser
,
who
seemed
utterly
reckless
of
the
pain
he
was
inflicting
.
<EOS>
"
But
for
yourown
folly
,
you
might
now
be
worth
three
thousand
a

year,--ay

threethousand

for
I
knew
your
father

<EOS>
Why

<EOS>
"If

Randulph

"You

turning
to

calmly

also

there
is
a

present

<EOS>
""True

replied
the

recovering
himself
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
not

over

I

Andnow
,
"
he
added
,
sinking
into
the
chair
,
and
looking
at
Randulph
,
"
Let
meinquire
after
your
mother

<EOS>
I
remember
her
well
as
Sophia
Beechcroft

anda
charming
creature

she
was

<EOS>
You
resemble

more

your

<EOS>
Nay
,
restrain
your
blushes
,
I
do
n't
mean
to
flatter
you
.
<EOS>
That
which
is
abeauty
in
a
woman
,
is
a
defect
in
a
man
;
and
your
fair
skin
and
longhair
would
become
your
sister
,
if
you
have
one
,
better
than
yourself

<EOS>
""Really
<EOS>
sir

"
rejoined
Randulph
,
again
reddening
,
"
you
make
strangelyfree
with

<EOS>
""I
made
free
with
your
father
before
you
,
young
man
,
"
rejoined
themiser
;
"
and
it
was
for
telling
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
that
I
lost
hisfriendship

<EOS>
More
's
the
pity!--more
's
the
pity

<EOS>
I
would
have
served

he
would
have
let
me
.
<EOS>
But
to
return
to
your
mother
.
<EOS>
You
actedunjustly
to
her
,
as
well
as
to
yourself
,
in
not
retaining
the
familyestates
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
mother
has
her
own
private
property
to
live
on
,
"
replied
the
youngman
,
who
winced
under
the
stinging
observations
of
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
what
's
that
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
a
beggarly
--
I
crave
yourpardon
--
a
pitiful
hundred
a

year

so

<EOS>
Not
that
a
hundred
a

year
ispitiful
,
but
it
must
be
so
to
her
with
her
notions
and
habits
.
<EOS>
""There
you
are
mistaken
,
sir

"
replied
Randulph
;
"
my
mother
is
entirelyreconciled
to
her
situation
,
and
lives
accordingly
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
in
a
sceptical
tone
;
"
I
own
Idid
not
give
her
credit
for
being
able
to
do
so
,
but
I
hope
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
""Hope
,
sir
,
"
cried
Randulph
,
angrily
;
"
is
my
word
doubted?""Not
in
the
least
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
drily
;
"
but
young
people
are
aptto
take
things
on
trust
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
as
you
have
fooled
away
your
fortune
,
may
I
ask
what
you
are
about
to
do
to
retrieve
it
?
<EOS>
What
profession
,
<EOS>
orrather
<EOS>
what
trade
do
you
propose

follow?""I

<EOS>
"
My

small

enable
me
to
live
as
a
gentleman

<EOS>
""Hum
!
"
cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
,
however
,
you
would
not
object
tosome
employment

<EOS>
An
idle
man
is
always
an
expensive
man

<EOS>
But
whatbrought
you
to
London?""My
chief
motive
was
to
deliver
that
packet
to
you

replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
must
own
<EOS>
I
was
not
altogether
uninfluenced

a
desire

I
have
never

I
was

<EOS>
""You

rejoined
the
miser
;
"
and
if
you
will
take
myadvice
you
will
go
back
more
quickly

you
came

<EOS>
But
I

you

it

idle

urge
you

<EOS>
""I

<EOS>
replied
Randulph
,
frowning
.
"Hum

<EOS>
"
said
the
miser
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
;
"
so
you
wo
nt
be
advised
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
the
way
with
all
young
people
,
and
I
ought
not
to
expect
tofind
you
an
exception
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
you
mean
to
stay
with
your
two
uncles

<EOS>
Abel
and
Trussell
Beechcroft
.
<EOS>
""Such
is
my
intention

replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
have
not
seen
them
for
years

pursued
Scarve
;
"

if
you
are
notacquainted

'll
give
you
their
characters

<EOS>
Abel

true

<EOS>
Trussell

pleasant

plausible

hollow

<EOS>
And
you
willjudge
of
my
candour
when
I
tell
you
that
the
first
hates
me

while
thelatter
is
very
friendly
disposed

me

<EOS>
You
will
take

dislike
the

you
will
find
out
your
error
in
time

<EOS>
Mindwhat
I
say
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
look
at
the
packet
,
for
I
have
kept
you
heretoo
long
,

have
nothing
to
offer
you

<EOS>
""There
is
nearly
a
glass

Jacob

who
had
stood
stock
still
during

with
the

Perhaps

""Hold

cried

sharply

snuff

he
added
,
as
Jacob
applied
hisimmense
digits
to
the
tufted
wick
,
and
stamped
upon
the
snuff
as
he
castit
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
"
What
can
this
packet
contain
?
<EOS>
Let
me
see

"
hecontinued
,
breaking
the
seal
,
and
disclosing
a
letter
,
which
he
opened
,
and
found
it
contained
a
small
memorandum
.
<EOS>
As
he
glanced
at
it
,
a
shadecame
over
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
attempt
to
read
the
letter
,
butfolding
it
over
the
smaller
piece
of
paper
,
unlocked
a
small
strong
boxthat
stood
at
his
feet
beneath
the
table
,
and
placed
them
both
withinit
.
<EOS>
"It
is
time
you
went
to
your
uncle

young
man

"
he
said
to
Randulph
,
in
an
altered
tone
,
and
more
coldly
than
before
;
"
I

be
glad

Good

""I

looking
earnestly
at
Hilda

"Jacob

cried
the

hastily
.
<EOS>
"Good

Randulph
still
lingering

<EOS>
"
Do

away

"There

<EOS>
Good

added
to
Hilda
,
as
Jacob
departed
with
the
young
man

<EOS>
Jacob
having
again
placed
the
candle
in
the
lantern
,
unbolted
andunlocked
the
door
,
and
issuing
forth
,
they
found
Peter

standingbeside
the
horse

<EOS>
"You
may
thank
me
that
your

said
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"People

<EOS>
Well

"Not

Jacob
,
with
a
hoarse
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Did

tell

did
not

<EOS>
Why

's
dying

<EOS>
ho!""You

insolent

rejoined
Peter
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"What
,
you
want
another
taste
of
my
crabstick

do
you

said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"It
's
close

<EOS>
""Don't

laughed
Randulph
,
springing
into
the
saddle

<EOS>
"Good

Jacob

<EOS>
I
shall
hope
ere

see
your

<EOS>
"
With
this
he
struck
spurs
into
his
steed
,
androde
off
in
the
direction
of
Westminster
bridge
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
"
said
Peter
,
as
he
crossed
over
the
way
to
his
own
dwelling,"I've
<EOS>
managed
to
get
a

out

<EOS>
Perhaps

LADYBRABAZON.The

lived
in
a
retired
housein
Lambeth
,
close
to
the
river
,
and
a
little
to
the
west
of
the
palace
.
<EOS>
Both
were
<EOS>
middle
-
aged
men,--that
is
to
say,--for
<EOS>
it
is
<EOS>
difficult
todetermine
<EOS>
what
is
the
middle
age
,
now
-
a
-
days
,
though
it
was
not
quite
sodifficult
to
fix
the
period
in
the
last
century,--one
<EOS>
was
fifty
-
six
,
andthe
other
ten
years
younger
,
and
both
bachelors
.
<EOS>
That
they
livedtogether

and
in
this
retired
way
,
was
not
so
much
matter
of
choice
asof
necessity
on
the
part

the

Trussell

for
he
wouldhave
preferred

if
it
had
been
in
his
power
,
a
gayer
kind
of
life
.
<EOS>
Butfortune
decreed
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
The
father
of
the
brothers
was
a
wealthymerchant
,
who
was
determined
to
make
an
elder
son
,
and
he
accordinglyleft
the
bulk
of
his
property
,
except
some
trifling
bequests
to
hisdaughter
Sophia
(
Randulph
's
mother
)
and
Trussell
,
to
his
first
-
bornAbel
.
<EOS>
Abel
,
however
,
behaved
very
handsomely
upon
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Heinstantly
made
over
to
his
brother
what
he
considered
his
rightful
shareof
the
property
,
and
to
his
sister
another
division
.
<EOS>
In
neither
case
didthe
gift
prosper
.
<EOS>
Trussell
soon
squandered
away
all
his
modicum
ingaming
and
every
other
sort
of
extravagance
,
while
Sophia
's
portion
wasdissipated
,
though
in
a
different
way
,
by
her
thoughtless
andimprovident
husband
.
<EOS>
There
are
,
indeed
,
so
many
ways
of
getting
rid
ofmoney
,
that
it
is
difficult
to
say
which
is
the
most
expeditious
;
norwould
it
be
easy
to
tell
whether
Trussell
or
his
sister
soonest
got
ridof
their
brother
's
bounty
.
<EOS>
A
small
sum
had
been
settled
upon
Mrs.
Crewby
her
father
,
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
,
and
on
this
she
now
lived
.
<EOS>
Completely
reduced
in
circumstances
,
Trussell
was
thrown
upon
hisbrother
,
who
very
kindly
received
him
,
but
compelled
him
to
live
in
hisown
quiet
manner
.
<EOS>
This
did
not
suit
the
more
mercurial
brother
,
and
hemore
than
once
tried
to
live
on
his
own
resources
;
but
failing
,
in
theattempt
,
he
was
compelled
to
come
back
to
the
old
quarters
.
<EOS>
Now
that
agehad
somewhat
calmed
him
,
he
was
more
reconciled
to
his
situation
.
<EOS>
Havinglittle
money
to
spend
,
for
his
brother
of
course
regulated
hisallowance
,
he
could
not
indulge
in
any
of
the
dearer
amusements,--hecould
neither
play
nor
frequent
the
more
expensive
coffee
-
houses
,
clubs
,
theatres
,
opera
,
or
other
places
of
public
entertainment
,
except
on
rareoccasions
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
daily
to
be
seen
sauntering
on
the
Mall
,
or
inPiccadilly
,
and
as
he
had
a
tolerably
extensive
acquaintance
with
thebeau
monde
,
he
was
at
no
loss
for
society
.
<EOS>
The
Cocoa
-
Tree
and
White'swere
too
extravagant
for
him,--the
Smyrna
and
the
Saint
James
'
<EOS>
tooexclusively
political,--Young
Man
's
too
Military,--Old
Man
's
<EOS>
too
muchfrequented
by
stock
-
jobbers,--and
Little
Man
's
by
sharpers,--so
<EOS>
hestruck
a
middle
course
,
and
adopted
the
British
.
<EOS>
This
was
during
theday
-
time
,
but
after
the
play
;
if
by
chance
he
went
thither
,
he
woulddrop
into
Tom
's
or
Will
's
coffee
-
houses
,
to
talk
over
theperformance
--
to
play
a
game
at
picquet
--
or
to
lose
a
half
-
crown
at
faro
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
would
tempt
him
to
risk
,
even
the
smallest
sum
,
at
hazard
.
<EOS>
The
ordinaries
he
rarely
attended
;
never
,
indeed
,
unless
invited
by
afriend
to
dine
with
him
at
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Such
was
Trussell
Beechcroft
's
daily
routine
.
<EOS>
Perfectly
well
-
bred
,
ofeasy
and
polished
manners
,
good
taste
,
and
imperturbable
temper
<EOS>
,
he
wasan
acceptable
companion
everywhere
,
and
it
was
a
matter
of
surprise
toall
that
he
had
not
got
on
better
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
Trussell
was
about
themiddle
height
,
somewhat
corpulent
and
short
-
necked
,
and
had
a
round
fullface
.
<EOS>
He
was
by
no
means
handsome
,
nor
had
he
ever
been
so
,
but
hisfeatures
were
decidedly
prepossessing
.
<EOS>
He
was
scrupulously
neat
in
hisattire
,
and
a
little
,
perhaps
,
too
attentive
to
personal
decoration
foran
elderly
gentleman
:
at
least
his
brother
thought
so
.
<EOS>
Abel
Beechcroft
was
a
very
different
character
.
<EOS>
Some
earlydisappointment
in
life
,
in
a
matter
of
the
heart
,
it
was
reported
,
hadsoured
his
temper
,
and
given
a
misanthropic
turn
to
his
mind
.
<EOS>
He
mingledlittle
with
the
world
,
and
when
he
did
so
it
was
only
to
furnish
himselfwith
fresh
material
for
railing
at
its
follies
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
confirmedwoman
-
hater
,
shunned
the
society
of
the
sex
,
and
never
would
see
hissister
after
her
marriage
,
because
she
had
in
some
way
or
other
,
thoughin
what
was
never
disclosed
,
been
connected
with
the
bitterest
event
inhis
life
.
<EOS>
In
person
,
Abel
was
short
,
thin
,
and
slightly
deformed
,
havingvery
high
shoulders
,
almost
amounting
to
a
hump
;
and
his
neck
beingshort
,
like
his
brother
's
,
his
large
chin
almost
reposed
upon
his
chest
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
somewhat
coarse
,
with
a
long
prominent
nose
,
andpointed
chin
,
but
his
broad
,
massive
forehead
,
and
keen
gray
eyes
,
gavea
great
degree
of
intelligence
to
them
,
while
his
shrewd
,
satiricalexpression
redeemed
them
from
anything
like
a
common
-
place
character
.
<EOS>
It
has
been
said
that
he
lived
quietly
,
but
he
also
lived
verycomfortably
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
snug
than
his
retreat
at
Lambeth
,
with
its
fine
garden
,
its
green
-
house
,
its
walls
covered
with
fruittrees
,
and
its
summer
-
house
with
windows
commanding
the
river
,
andfrescoed
ceiling
painted
in
the
time
of
Charles
the
Second
,
at
whichepoch
the
house
was
built
,
and
the
garden
laid
out
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
somechoice
pictures
of
the
Flemish
school
,
two
or
three
of
Charles'sbeauties
,
undoubted
originals
,
by
Lely
and
Kneller
,
but
placed
in
hisbrother
's
room
,
to
be
out
of
his
own
sight
--
an
arrangement
to
whichTrussell
raised
no
objection
;
plenty
of
old
china
,
and
old
japannedcabinets
;
a
good
library
,
in
which
the
old
poets
,
the
old
dramatists
,
and
the
old
chroniclers
found
a
place
;
and
above
all
a
good
store
of
oldwine
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
fact
by
no
means
indifferent
to
good
cheer
,
and
enjoyedlife
in
his
own
way
with
a
keen
zest
.
<EOS>
He
had
an
old
butler
who
managedall
for
him
,
for
he
would
never
suffer
a
female
servant
to
come
in
hissight
,
and
this
person
,
Josiah
Jukes
,
or
as
he
was
generally
called
,
Mr
.
Jukes
,
was
the
only
individual
that
ever
presumed
to
contradict
him
.
<EOS>
Randulph
's
uncles
had
been
apprised
of
his
visit
to
town
,
and
they
weretherefore
expecting
his
arrival
.
<EOS>
The
journey
from
Knutsford
in
Cheshire
,
whence
he
had
started
,
occupied
five
days
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
a
rawcountry
lad
,
who
served
him
as
groom
,
and
whom
he
had
sent
forward
toannounce
his
arrival
to
his
uncles
,
while
he
left
the
packet
with
Mr
.
Scarve
;
but
poor
Tom
Birch
,
for
so
the
lad
was
called
,
missed
his
way
,
and
instead
of
turning
to
the
right
after
crossing
Westminster
bridge
,
went
to
the
left
,
and
strayed
to
Saint
George
's
Fields
;
nor
was
it
tillan
hour
after
his
master
's
arrival
that
he
found
his
way
to
the
house
inLambeth
.
<EOS>
Abel
Beechcroft
,
who
had
expected
his
nephew
early
in
the
day
,
and
hadin
fact
waited
dinner
for
him
--
a
compliment
he
very
rarely
paid
to
anyone,--became
,
as
he
did
not
appear
,
waspish
and
peevish
to
a
degree
thathis
brother
's
patience
could
hardly
tolerate
.
<EOS>
He
grumbled
during
thewhole
of
dinner
,
which
he
declared
was
uneatable
,
and
when
the
cloth
wasremoved
,
began
to
find
fault
with
the
wine
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
bottle
's
corked
,
"
he
said
,
as
he
tasted
the
first
glass
;
"
all
thefault
of
that
young
fellow
.
<EOS>
I
wish
I
had
never
promised
to
receive
him
.
<EOS>
I
dare
say
some
accident
has
happened
to
him
.
<EOS>
I
hope
it
may
turn
outso
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
n't
hope
any
such
thing
,
sir
,
"
remarked
Mr.
Jukes
,
a
little
roundrosy
man
in
a
plain
livery
,
"
you
do
n't
hope
any
such
thing
,
<EOS>
so
don'tbelie
yourself
,
and
do
your
good
heart
an
injustice
.
<EOS>
The
wine
's
notcorked
,
"
he
added
,
taking
the
bottle
to
the
sideboard
,
and
tasting
it
.
<EOS>
"Try
<EOS>
another
glass
.
<EOS>
Your
palate
's
out
of
order
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
well
it
may
be
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
"
replied
Abel
,
"
for
my
digestion
hasbeen
sadly
disturbed
by
this
waiting
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
find
I
was
mistaken
,
"
headded
,
tasting
the
glass
poured
out
for
him
,
"
there
is
nothing
thematter
with
the
wine
.
<EOS>
""On
<EOS>
the
contrary
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
think
it
an
excellent
bottle
,
"
remarkedTrussell
,
"
and
I
propose
that
we
drink
our
worthy
sister
's
goodhealth,--Heaven
bless
her
!
<EOS>
Much
I
should
like
to
see
her!--and
<EOS>
her
son'ssafe
and
speedy
arrival
.
<EOS>
""Come
,
sir
,
you
can
not
refuse
that
pledge
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
,
filling
hismaster
's
glass
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
drink
it
myself
,
"
he
added
,
again
carrying
thebottle
to
the
sideboard
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
wonder
what
we
shall
find
Randulph
like
,
"
mused
Trussell
,
"
<EOS>
forwe
have
not
seen
him
since
he
was
a
little
fellow
not
higher
than
thistable
,
when
his
poor
father
brought
him
to
town
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
the
same
token
that
his
poor
father
borrowed
two
thousand
pounds
ofme
at
the
time
,
every
farthing
of
which
I
lost
,
"
growled
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
no
matter
<EOS>
sir
.
<EOS>
You
never
felt
the
loss
,
so
what
does
itsignify
,
"
remarked
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"I
have
no
doubt
Randulph
will
be
a
very
fine
young
man
,
"
pursuedTrussell
;
"
Sophia
writes
word
that
he
is
her
exact
image
,
and
she
wascertainly
the
finest
woman
of
her
day
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Change
thesubject
,
brother
.
<EOS>
Change
the
subject
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
some
minutes
there
was
a
profound
silence
,
which
was
at
lengthbroken
by
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
you
mean
to
take
this
young
lad
,
if
he
comes
,
to
see
all
thesights
,
brother
?
"
he
remarked
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
of
course
,
sir
,
of
course
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
"
I
must
introduce
himto
the
world
;
shew
him
all
the
public
places
,
and
public
characters
,
andgive
him
a
slight
taste
of
town
life
.
<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
it
be
a
very
slight
taste
,
brother
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
sharply
,
"
andnot
enough
to
give
him
an
appetite
for
pernicious
food
.
<EOS>
Our
nephew
mustbe
perfectly
unsophisticated
,
and
I
doubt
not
,
from
what
I
hear
of
him
,
and
indeed
know
of
him
,
a
youth
of
excellent
principles
.
<EOS>
I
think
hisconduct
,
in
surrendering
his
estates
to
his
father
's
creditors
,
noble
.
<EOS>
Ihave
great
hopes
of
him
,
and
if
he
turns
out
well
,
will
take
care
hedoes
not
lose
in
the
end
by
his
disinterestedness
.
<EOS>
But
that
depends
uponhimself
,
and
in
some
degree
on
you
.
<EOS>
""On
me
,
sir
!
<EOS>
How
so
?
"
asked
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Thus
,
"
replied
the
elder
brother
;
"
thus
.
<EOS>
He
is
coming
to
town
;
you
willgive
him
certain
introductions
;
these
may
turn
out
to
his
advantage
--
mayraise
him
in
society
,
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
If
so
,
well
and
good
.
<EOS>
But
if
youonly
teach
him
to
ape
the
follies
and
vices
of
those
of
a
higher
rankthan
himself
--
if
you
make
him
a
weak
and
frivolous
,
and
perhaps
vicious
,
character
;
if
,
in
short
,
you
expose
him
to
a
test
which
he
can
not
bear
,
I
cast
him
off
,
and
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
provided
<EOS>
he
answers
your
expectations
,
do
you
propose
to
leave
hima
fortune
,
sir
?
<EOS>
or
to
give
him
one
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Trussell
,
curiously
.
"Why
<EOS>
do
you
ask
,
brother
--
why
do
you
ask
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Abel
,
eyeing
himnarrowly
from
beneath
his
great
bent
brows
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
;
I
only
ask
out
of
mere
curiosity
,
sir
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
seizingthe
bottle
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
have
no
other
motive
.
<EOS>
""Hem
!
"
cried
Abel
,
coughing
drily
.
<EOS>
"I'll
bring
you
more
wine
in
a
moment
,
gentlemen
,
"
interposed
<EOS>
Mr.
Jukes;"the
bottle
is
empty
Mr.
Trussell
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
it
is
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
;
I
'll
do
my
best
,
sir
,
tobe
a
Mentor
to
him
,
and
I
hope
I
may
succeed
in
carrying
him
through
thefiery
furnace
unscathed
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
not
be
too
hard
upon
him
if
heshould
be
guilty
of
some
slight
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
You
must
recollect
,
sir
,
that
we
have
been
young
ourselves
;
and
that
few
men
have
their
passionsso
much
under
control
as
yourself

<EOS>
""I
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
with
bitter
contempt
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
mocking
me
,
brother
.
<EOS>
But
go
on
.
<EOS>
""I
have
nothing
more
to
add
,
sir

"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
will
speak
!
"
<EOS>
said
Abel
,
in
a
low
,
deep
tone
,
and
bending
towardshis
brother

<EOS>
"
Trussell
,
one
word
more
on
this
subject
,
and
I
dismiss
it
.
<EOS>
Whether
I
make
my
nephew
my
heir
or
not
,
will
make
no
difference
to
you

<EOS>
What
I
have
done
for
you

I
have
done

and
I
shall
do
no

<EOS>
You
canhave
<EOS>
no

therefore

for
leading
him
astray

<EOS>
""I
am
grieved
to
find
you
should
think
me
capable
of
such
a
basedesign

"
replied
Trussell
,
colouring
deeply
;
"
but
I
will
take
no
offenceat
what
you
say

<EOS>
I

my

""I

chuckling

scoundrel

would
act
insuch
a
way
;
and
if
he
succeeded
,
would
be
applauded
for
this
conduct

<EOS>
Iam
glad
you
take
the
caution
in
good
part

<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
Mr.
Jukes
opportunely
entered
with
a
fresh
bottle
of
wine
,
whichproved
in
admirable
condition
;
and
Abel
having
expended
his
ill
-
humour
,
the
conversation
was
carried
on
in
a
much
more
agreeable
manner
for
anhour
,
when
both
brothers
adjourned
to
the
garden
,
and
smoked
a
pipe
inthe
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
charming
evening
,
and
the
river
,
which
wasstudded
with
boats
,
presented
a
lively
and
pleasant
sight
.
<EOS>
As
night
drewon
,
however
,
Abel
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
could
not
conceal
hisuneasiness
.
<EOS>
"Something
<EOS>
must
have
happened
to
the
lad
,
Jukes
,
"
he
said
:
"
my
mindmisgives
me
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
robbed
,
and
perhaps
maltreated
by
some
of
thehighwaymen
that
haunt
Finchley
Common
.
""Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
do
n't
make
yourself
uneasy
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
He
'll
behere
presently
,
I
'll
warrant
him
.
<EOS>
What
has
he
to
be
robbed
of?""Nothing
much
,
that
's
certain
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
But
it
is
getting
late
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
near
ten
o'clock
.
<EOS>
He
wo
n't
even
be
in
time
for
supper
.
<EOS>
""I've
ordered
supper
to
be
kept
back
an
hour
,
sir
,
"
said
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
devil
you
have
!
"
cried
Abel
angrily
.
"
<EOS>
And
do
you
think
I
'll
submitto
such
an
arrangement
?
<EOS>
Would
you
ruin
my
digestion
,
rascal
?
<EOS>
My
stomachis
as
regular
as
clockwork
.
<EOS>
Serve
it
,
directly
,
sirrah!"As
Mr.
Jukes
departed
to
see
his
master
's
commands
obeyed
,
he
wasagreeably
surprised
by
a
loud
knocking
at
the
outer
door
,
and
,
waddlingthither
with
the
other
servants
as
fast
as
he
could
,
was
enchanted
tofind
the
summons
proceeded
from
the
expected
guest
.
<EOS>
Randulph
's
horse
wastaken
charge
of
,
and
he
himself
speedily
ushered
into
the
presence
ofhis
uncles
,
who
both
welcomed
him
warmly
and
affectionately
;
though
Abelcould
not
help
mixing
up
with
his
greetings
some
reproofs
for
his
latearrival
.
<EOS>
Randulph
replied
that
he
had
sent
on
his
servant
to
announcehim
,
and
account
for
the
delay
,
and
it
then
came
out
that
the
lad
hadnot
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
then
went
on
to
explain
themotive
of
his
visit
to
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
this
name
,
Randulphobserved
both
his
uncles
look
extremely
blank
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Abel
in
particularseemed
angry
and
disconcerted
.
<EOS>
"You
must
never
go
near
that
house
again
,
"
said
the
latter
,
at
length
,
in
an
authoritative
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Mark
me
--
on
pain
of
my
displeasure
,
I
forbidit
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so
,
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Randulph
,
who
had
been
schooled
by
his
mother
totreat
Abel
with
great
deference
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
ask
me
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
sufficient
that
I
forbid
you
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
felt
disposed
to
remonstrate
,
more
especially
as
the
figure
ofthe
beautiful
Hilda
Scarve
<EOS>
rose
before
his
recollection
;
but
Uncle
Abelat
that
moment
turning
away
<EOS>
,
his
sleeve
was
plucked
by
Uncle
Trussell
,
who
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
Do
not
disobey
him
,
or
you
will
mar
yourfuture
fortunes
.
<EOS>
"Thus
advised
,
the
young
man
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
supper
wasserved
,
and
before
it
was
concluded
,
Randulph
's
groom
arrived
.
<EOS>
Manyquestions
were
put
to
his
nephew
by
Uncle
Trussell
respecting
hissister
,
her
state
of
health
,
and
other
matters
,
all
of
which
wereanswered
very
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
The
time
for
parting
,
however
,
came
,
andRandulph
was
not
sorry
to
retire
.
<EOS>
The
only
thing
that
dwelt
on
his
mindand
clouded
his
satisfaction
,
was
Uncle
Abel
's
peremptory
interdictionagainst
his
visits
to
the
miser
,
and
he
felt
he
should
have
difficultyin
observing
it
.
<EOS>
"It
is
strange
,
"
he
thought
,
"
that
my
mother
should
never
have
answeredany
of
my
inquiries
respecting
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
as
mysterious
asmy
uncles
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
much
like
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
But
the
daughter
is
charming
.
<EOS>
Heigho
!
<EOS>
I
must
positively
see
her
again
,
even
if
I
incur
Uncle
Abel'ssovereign
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"Next
morning
,
the
uncles
and
their
nephew
met
at
breakfast
at
an
earlyhour
,
when
the
subjects
discussed
on
the
previous
night
were
renewed
.
<EOS>
Now
that
he
had
completely
shaken
off
the
fatigue
of
his
journey
,
Randulph
looked
so
handsome
,
that
both
his
relations
were
greatly
takenwith
him
,
and
on
the
conclusion
of
some
remark
,
Uncle
Abel
said
,
as
ifunconsciously
,
"
He
is
,
indeed
,
very
like
his
mother
.
<EOS>
"Some
few
hours
were
then
spent
by
the
young
man
in
arranging
his
littlewardrobe
,
and
in
looking
out
some
letters
which
he
had
promised
todeliver
.
<EOS>
He
missed
one
,
however
,
and
after
turning
over
every
article
hepossessed
more
than
a
dozen
times
,
concluded
he
had
lost
it
.
<EOS>
What
madethe
matter
more
provoking
was
,
that
he
could
not
recollect
to
whom
itwas
addressed
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
received
it
amongst
others
from
his
mother
,
towhom
it
had
been
committed
by
a
friend
,
he
mentioned
its
loss
in
adespatch
which
he
proceeded
to
write
to
her
,
and
also
detailed
his
safearrival
,
and
the
impressions
made
upon
him
by
his
uncles
and
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
Strange
to
say
,
he
did
not
mention
Hilda
;
and
he
could
not
easilyaccount
to
himself
for
the
reluctance
he
felt
to
allude
to
her
.
<EOS>
Hisletter
concluded
,
he
went
down
stairs
,
and
found
both
his
unclesprepared
for
a
stroll
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
all
three
went
forth
,
and
,
crossing
Westminster
Bridge
,
shaped
their
course
towards
Saint
James'sPark
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
the
Little
Sanctuary
,
Randulph
could
not
helpgazing
towards
the
dungeon
-
like
dwelling
which
enshrined
her
who
hadmade
so
deep
an
impression
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Abel
noticed
his
look
,
andpartly
divining
the
cause
of
it
,
said
,
"
Remember
what
I
told
you
.
<EOS>
Disobey
me
,
and
you
will
rue
it
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
would
have
made
some
reply
,
but
he
was
checked
by
a
significantglance
from
Uncle
Trussell
.
<EOS>
Having
passed
through
the
Gate
House
,
they
entered
the
Park
by
a
smalldoorway
at
the
end
of
Prince's
-
court
.
<EOS>
It
was
now
noon
,
and
a
warm
andgenial
day
.
<EOS>
The
paths
between
the
avenues
of
trees
then
extendingbetween
this
point
and
Rosamond
's
Pond
were
crowded
with
persons
of
bothsex
,
and
of
all
ranks
,
summoned
forth
by
the
fineness
of
the
weather
.
<EOS>
Randulph
was
greatly
amused
by
all
he
saw
,
and
gazed
with
much
curiosityat
<EOS>
all
presented
to
his
view
.
<EOS>
Passing
by
the
Decoy
,
the
party
skirtedthe
great
canal
,
and
,
leaving
Rosamond
's
Pond
on
the
left
,
proceededtowards
Buckingham
House
.
<EOS>
Just
at
this
juncture
,
uncle
Trussell
caught
sight
of
a
gay
partyapproaching
,
and
exclaimed
,
in
a
joyful
tone
,
to
his
nephew
,
"
As
I
live
,
we
are
most
fortunate
.
<EOS>
There
is
the
leader
of
fashion
,
Beau
Villiers
,
coming
towards
us
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
him
,
nephew
--
you
shall
know
him
.
<EOS>
Theladies
he
is
walking
with
are
Lady
Brabazon
and
the
HonourableClementina
Brabazon
:
a
fine
girl
,
Clementina
--
a
remarkably
fine
girl;perfect
in
style
and
manners
--
quite
a
toast
among
the
sparks
.
<EOS>
The
oldfellow
at
her
side
,
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
was
a
great
beau
in
his
time
,
though
never
equal
to
Villiers
,
who
far
surpasses
even
his
prototype
,
Beau
Fielding
,
in
style
and
taste
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
them
all
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
nice
acquaintances
you
will
make
,
"
remarked
uncle
Abel
,
sneeringly
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
mind
him
,
Randulph
,
"
whispered
uncle
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
know
thisset
,
and
they
like
you

you
may
know

you

Beau

from
the
highest
down
to

to--""Mr

Trussell

"
replied
uncle
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
down
to
me
if
you
please
,
"
rejoined
uncle
Trussell
,
"
and
thatshews
it
does
not
extend
too
low
.
<EOS>
But
,
Randulph
,
I
beg
you
to
look
atthe
beau
.
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
see
a
finer
man?""He
is
very
handsome
certainly
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
"
and
remarkably
welldressed
.
<EOS>
""He
is
a
great
coxcomb
,
a
great
rake
,
and
a
great
gamester
,
Randulph,"said
uncle
Abel
;
<EOS>
"
beware
of
him
.
<EOS>
""Tush
<EOS>
,
never
mind
what
he
says
,
"
rejoined
uncle
Trussell
,
who
reallywished
to
have
the
eclat
of
introducing
his
handsome
nephew
to
the
greatbeau
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Come
along!"So
saying
,
he
took
his
nephew
's
arm
,
and
hurried
him
forward
.
<EOS>
Pushingtheir
way
through
the
throng
,
when
near
the
sentry
box
oppositeBuckingham
House
,
they
encountered
the
party
in
question
.
<EOS>
Beau
Villiers
,
who
was
,
indeed
,
a
remarkably
handsome
man
,
and
dressedin
the
extremity
of
the
mode
,
wore
a
light
-
blue
embossed
velvet
coat
,
embroidered
with
silver
,
with
broad
cuffs
similarly
ornamented
;
a
whitewaistcoat
,
of
the
richest
silk
,
likewise
laced
with
silver
;
tawny
velvetbreeches
,
partly
covered
with
pearl
-
coloured
silk
hose
,
drawn
above
theknee
,
and
secured
with
silver
garters
.
<EOS>
His
dress
was
completed
by
shoesof
black
Spanish
leather
,
fastened
by
large
diamond
buckles
,
and
asuperb
Ramillie
perriwig
of
the
lightest
flaxen
hair
,
which
set
off
hisbrilliant
complexion
,
and
fine
eyes
,
to
admiration
.
<EOS>
He
carried
athree
-
cornered
hat
,
fringed
with
feathers
,
and
a
clouded
cane
,
mountedwith
a
valuable
pebble
.
<EOS>
Near
the
beau
walked
Lady
Brabazon
,
a
gorgeous
dame
of
aboutfive
-
and
-
forty
,
and
still
possessed
of
great
personal
attractions
,
whichshe
omitted
no
means
of
displaying
.
<EOS>
She
wore
a
hoop
,
and
a
white
andsilver
satin
sack
.
<EOS>
Struck
by
Randulph
's
figure
at
a
distance
,
she
hadpointed
him
out
to
the
beau
,
who
thereupon
vouchsafed
to
look
towardshim
.
<EOS>
Behind
Lady
Brabazon
came
her
daughter
Clementina
,
a
very
prettyand
very
affected
blonde
of
two
-
and
-
twenty
,
with
an
excessively
delicatecomplexion
,
fair
hair
,
summer
blue
eyes
,
and
a
very
mincing
gait
.
<EOS>
Shewas
exquisitely
dressed
in
the
last
new
mode
,
with
a
small
escalopedlace
cap
,
her
hair
curled
at
her
sides
,
a
triple
row
of
pearls
round
herneck
,
and
a
diamond
cross
attached
to
the
chain
;
and
though
shepretended
to
be
interested
in
the
discourse
of
the
old
knight
,
it
wasevident
her
regards
were
attracted
by
the
handsome
young
stranger
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
old
beau
,
he
was
,
indeed
,
supremely
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
He
was
attiredin
a
richly
-
embroidered
cinnamon
-
coloured
velvet
coat
,
with
fur
cuffs
ofa
preposterous
size
,
each
as
large
as
a
modern
muff
.
<EOS>
His
pantaloon
legswere
covered
with
pink
silk
hose
;
his
wrinkled
features
were
rouged
andbepatched
;
and
his
wig
was
tied
with
a
large
bow
,
and
had
such
animmense
cue
to
it
,
that
it
looked
as
if
a
great
dragon
-
fly
had
perchedon
the
back
of
his
neck
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
was
attended
by
a
little
blackpage
,
in
a
turban
and
eastern
dress
,
who
had
charge
of
her
favouritelap
-
dog
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
two
parties
had
met
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Abel
drew
on
one
side
toallow
the
introduction
to
take
place
,
and
to
witness
it
.
<EOS>
Uncle
Trussellstepped
forward
,
and
bowing
obsequiously
to
Beau
Villiers
,
pointed
toRandulph
,
who
stood
on
his
right
,
saying
,
"
Permit
me
to
introduce
mynephew
,
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
to
you
,
Mr.
Villiers
.
<EOS>
He
is
fresh
from
thecountry
.
<EOS>
But
even
there
your
reputation
has
reached
him
.
<EOS>
""I
am
happy
to
make
his
acquaintance
,
"
replied
the
beau
,
courteouslyreturning
Randulph
's
bow
,
and
eyeing
him
curiously
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Onmy
faith
,
your
ladyship
,
"
he
added
aloud
to
Lady
Brabazon
,
"
the
youngman
is
not
amiss
,
but
destroyed
by
his
dress
and
rustic
air
.
<EOS>
""I
really
think
something
may
be
made
of
him
,
"
returned
Lady
Brabazon
,
in
the
same
loud
and
confidential
tone
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Trussell
Beechcroft
,
makeyour
nephew
known
to
me
.
<EOS>
""With
the
greatest
pleasure
,
your
ladyship
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
obeyingher
behest
.
<EOS>
"Come
with
us
,
"
said
Lady
Brabazon
,
to
Randulph
,
after
the
ceremony
hadbeen
gone
through
,
"
<EOS>
My
daughter
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
she
added
as
they
passedalong
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
by
,
who
was
that
strange
old
man
I
saw
walking
with
youjust
now?""Who
?
"
rejoined
Randulph
,
evasively
,
for
he
felt
ashamed
,
he
knew
notwhy
,
of
acknowledging
his
uncle
.
"There
<EOS>
he
is
,
"
said
Lady
Brabazon
,
pointing
with
her
fan
backwards
,
"
heis
staring
hard
at
us
,
and
looks
exactly
like
a
bailiff
.
<EOS>
""It
is
my
uncle
Abel
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
in
some
confusion
.
<EOS>
"Your
uncle
Abel
!
"
cried
Lady
Brabazon
,
with
a
scream
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thenthe
sooner
you
get
rid
of
uncle
Abel
the
better
.
<EOS>
"Abel
could
not
hear
the
words
,
but
he
heard
the
laugh
,
and
saw
thegesture
,
as
well
as
his
nephew
's
confusion
,
and
knew
that
he
was
theobject
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
turned
away
in
the
opposite
direction
,
muttering
tohimself
as
he
went
,
"
<EOS>
So
,
he
has
taken
the
first
step
.

THE
BRIBE.Uncle
Abel
returned
home
by
himself
about
two
o'clock
,
in
a
very
illhumour
indeed
,
and
,
vouchsafing
no
answer
to
Mr.
Jukes
,
who
smilinglyinquired
where
he
had
left
the
two
gentlemen
,
proceeded
at
once
to
thelibrary
.
<EOS>
Knowing
the
peculiarity
of
his
master
's
temper
,
the
discreetbutler
left
him
to
himself
,
but
ventured
,
unsummoned
,
into
his
presencein
about
half
an
hour
,
and
found
him
in
the
act
of
tearing
up
a
letter
,
and
throwing
the
fragments
into
the
grate
.
<EOS>
"What
brings
you
here
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
turning
sharply
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
Ididn't
ring
the
bell
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
know
you
did
n't
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
was
certain
youwanted
me
,
nevertheless
.
<EOS>
""You
were
certain
of
no
such
thing
,
sirrah
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
in
a
tonethat
contradicted
the
asperity
of
his
words
,
"
and
you
presume
too
muchon
your
long
services
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
presume
too
much
on
your
kindness
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Jukes
,
inaccents
oddly
enough
compounded
of
familiarity
and
respect
.
<EOS>
"
I
seeplainly
that
something
has
gone
wrong
,
and
perhaps
I
may
be
able
to
setit
right
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
shut
the
door
.
<EOS>
Jukes
,
"
returned
Abel
,
seating
himself
,
"
and
putthe
window
<EOS>
down,--why
was
it
left
<EOS>
open?--you
<EOS>
know
I
ca
n't
bear
adraught
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
think
of
my
nephew?""That
<EOS>
he
's
a
remarkably
fine
young
man
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ihaven't
seen
a
handsomer
man
this
many
a
day
.
<EOS>
And
Mr.
Trussell
was
quiteright
when
he
said
he
was
like
your
sister
.
<EOS>
He
's
the
perfect
picture
ofher
as
she
was
when--""Nevermind
<EOS>
the
likeness
,
Jukes
,
"
interrupted
Abel
,
hastily
;
"
I
don'twant
to
know
what
you
think
of
his
good
looks
.
<EOS>
They
're
obviousenough
--
too
obvious
by
far
--
for
,
trust
me
,
<EOS>
whatever
you
may
think
of
thematter
,
it
is
a
great
misfortune
in
a
man
to
be
too
handsome
.
<EOS>
What
Iwish
to
have
is
your
opinion
of
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
""I
think
it
equal
to
his
good
looks
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
butler
,
promptly
.
<EOS>
"It
will
be
strange
indeed
,
if
he
does
n't
turn
out
a
fine
character
.
""Hum
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Abel
,
with
one
of
his
sneers
,
"
so
that
is
youropinion
,
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
I
thought
you
a
better
judge
.
<EOS>
""I
see
what
you
're
driving
at
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
butler
;
"
but
it
wontanswer
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
're
displeased
with
your
nephew
,
and
want
me
todisparage
him
;
but
I
tell
you
plainly
,
I
wo
nt
.
<EOS>
And
if
I
were
foolishenough
,
and
base
enough
to
do
so
,
no
one
would
be
more
angry
with
methan
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
think
Mr.
Randulph
a
very
fine
young
man
,
and
a
verypromising
young
man
;
and
I
'm
truly
happy
to
find
,
since
you
're
neverlikely
to
marry
,
that
you
'll
have
such
a
worthy
successor
.
<EOS>
"Accustomed
as
he
was
to
his
master
's
fitful
humours
,
Mr.
Jukes
was
notprepared
for
the
effect
which
his
words
produced
,
or
he
would
have
cutoff
his
tongue
sooner
than
have
uttered
them
.
<EOS>
Abel
,
who
was
gazing
athim
fixedly
as
he
commenced
,
cast
down
his
eyes
at
the
close
of
hisspeech
,
and
pressed
his
hand
convulsively
to
his
brow
.
<EOS>
He
remainedsilent
for
some
moments
,
and
then
,
giving
vent
to
his
suppressedrespiration
in
a
groan
,
walked
to
the
window
,
and
appeared
to
be
lookingout
into
the
garden
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Jukes
allowed
him
to
remain
undisturbed
for
afew
minutes
,
and
then
approached
him
.
<EOS>
"I'm
extremely
sorry
for
what
I
said
<EOS>
,
sir
,
"
he
remarked
,
penitentially;"I
ought
to
have
known
better
.
<EOS>
""You
said
nothing
,
Jukes
,
"
replied
Abel
,
sadly
,
yet
kindly
,
"
but
what
Iought
to
have
heard
unmoved
,
and
I
am
ashamed
of
my
own
weakness
.
<EOS>
It
isnot
because
I
shall
go
childless
to
the
grave
that
I
have
exhibited
thisemotion
,
but
because
your
allusion
has
opened
old
wounds
,
and
broughtthe
past
too
palpably
and
painfully
before
me
.
<EOS>
You
know
the
secrets
ofmy
heart
,
and
will
understand
what
a
train
of
emotion
a
chance
wordmight
awaken
.
<EOS>
I
am
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
Jukes,--callous
in
feeling
on
mostpoints
--
but
there
is
one
point
on
which
I
am
as
sensitive
as
ever
.
<EOS>
It
isthat
disappointment
--
<EOS>
that
blighting
which
I
met
with
from
--
from
<EOS>
--
Icannot
bring
myself
to
utter
her
name
.
<EOS>
The
wound
I
then
received
isincurable
.
<EOS>
I
shall
bear
it
to
my
dying
day
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
not
,
sir
<EOS>
--
I
hope
not
,
"
sympathised
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"I
hate
the
sex
,
Jukes
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
almost
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
nofaith
,
no
honesty
in
it
--
any
more
than
there
is
true
friendship
in
men
.
<EOS>
I
never
yet
knew
a
woman
whom
I
could
thoroughly
esteem
--
nor
a
man
onwhose
friendship
I
could
entirely
rely
.
<EOS>
If
I
could
make
an
exception
inthe
latter
case
,
it
would
be
in
favour
of
yourself
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
if
a
servant
was
ever
true
to
his
master
,
I
am
true
to
you
,
sir,"replied
Mr.
Jukes
,
earnestly
.
"
<EOS>
But
you
expect
too
much
from
humannature
.
<EOS>
Our
imperfect
condition
is
to
blame
,
not
ourselves
.
<EOS>
In
myopinion
,
there
are
more
true
-
hearted
women
than
the
reverse
;
and
Ishould
be
sorry
to
think
otherwise
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
search
the
world
over
forone
who
could
come
up
to
your
notions
of
perfection
,
I
fear
you
wouldnot
find
her
.
<EOS>
The
best
of
women
have
some
faults
,
and
the
worst
manyredeeming
qualities
.
<EOS>
But
with
all
their
faults
they
are
the
best
part
ofcreation
.
<EOS>
So
at
least
I
think
,
and
so
you
would
think
too
,
sir
,
if
yourchoice
had
not
been
so
unhappily
fixed
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
not
advert
to
it
again
.
<EOS>
Jukes
,
"
cried
Abel
,
repressing
a
pang
.
<EOS>
"I've
done
,
sir
--
I've
done
!
"
rejoined
Mr.
Jukes
,
hastily
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
may
Iventure
to
ask
what
has
displeased
you
with
your
nephew?""Perhaps
<EOS>
I
ought
not
to
be
angry
with
him
,
"
replied
Abel
;
"
but
I
watchedhim
closely
during
his
introduction
to
Beau
Villiers
and
Lady
Brabazonon
the
Mall
this
morning
,
and
saw
that
he
was
completely
dazzled
bythem
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I
clearly
detected
,
by
certain
looks
and
gestures
that
passedbetween
him
and
Lady
Brazen
,
for
such
should
be
her
title
,
that
she
puthim
to
the
blush
about
his
relationship
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
him
forthis
,
because
I
know
what
effect
appearances
have
upon
young
persons
,
and
how
difficult
it
is
to
understand
real
worth
when
set
against
theglitter
of
rank
and
fashion
,
however
worthless
or
vicious
the
latter
maybe
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
blame
him
,
I
say
,
but
I
lament
that
he
did
not
bear
hisfirst
trial
better
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
should
blame
Lady
Brabazon
,
not
him
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"Some
ladies
of
her
rank
have
a
way
of
abashing
modest
young
men
,
anddelight
in
doing
it
.
<EOS>
And
then
I
'm
sure
I
may
tell
you
without
offence
,
that
your
dress
is
scarcely
becoming
your
real
station
in
life
.
<EOS>
No
,
sir
,
I
do
n't
wonder
Mr.
Randulph
felt
a
little
embarrassed
.
<EOS>
I
might
just
aswell
complain
of
my
graceless
nephew
,
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
,
who
servesMr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
,
the
very
gentleman
you
've
mentioned
.
<EOS>
The
rascal
will
neverown
me
if
he
meets
me
in
the
Park
,
though
he
's
extremely
glad
to
call
me'nunks
,
'
and
wheedle
me
out
of
a
crown
at
other
times
.
<EOS>
But
what
do
Icare
for
his
impertinence
?
<EOS>
Nothing
at
all
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
,
Jukes
,
perhaps
you
are
right
,
"
said
Abel
,
after
a
moment'sreflection
;
"
and
perhaps
I
am
guilty
of
as
much
weakness
as
my
nephewhimself
,
in
feeling
hurt
by
the
matter
.
<EOS>
I
had
written
to
his
mother
onthe
subject
;
but
I
have
just
destroyed
the
letter
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
there
is
another
point
,
about
which
I
feel
considerableuneasiness
,
"
pursued
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Randulph
,
as
you
know
,
has
seen
HildaScarve
;
and
,
short
as
the
interview
was
,
it
was
long
enough
it
seems
forher
to
produce
a
strong
impression
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Now
,
"
he
continued
,
sternly
,
and
emphatically
,
"
he
never
shall
marry
that
girl
,
with
myconsent!--never
.
<EOS>
Jukes
!
<EOS>
And
if
he
should
marry
her
,
he
shall
never
havea
shilling
of
mine
.
<EOS>
I
have
forbidden
him
to
visit
the
house
;
but
I
amapprehensive
he
will
disobey
my
injunctions
.
<EOS>
If
he
goes
there
without
myknowledge
,
I
will
shut
my
doors
against
him
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
do
so
<EOS>
,
you
will
act
very
harshly
and
very
unjustly
sir
,
"
repliedMr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
;
"
and
<EOS>
so
I
tell
you
beforehand
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
fault
will
be
his
own
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
warned
him
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
your
part
to
see
Jacob
Post
,
if
the
fellow
is
still
with
themiser
,
and
ascertain
whether
Randulph
visits
the
house
.
<EOS>
D'yeunderstand?""Perfectly
,
"
replied
Jukes
,
"
but
I
do
n't
like
the
job
.
<EOS>
""Like
it
or
not
<EOS>
,
you
will
do
as
I
bid
you
,
"
continued
Abel
,
peremptorily
.
<EOS>
"
And
you
have
not
yet
received
the
whole
of
yourinstructions
.
<EOS>
You
say
that
your
nephew
serves
Mr.
Villiers
.
<EOS>
Bribe
him
tobring
word
what
Randulph
does
in
his
master
's
society
;
whether
he
games
,
drinks
,
or
riots
--
in
a
word
,
how
he
goes
on
.
<EOS>
""There
will
be
no
necessity
to
bribe
Crackenthorpe
to
tell
all
this,"returned
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
repeat
,
I
do
n't
like
such
underhandproceedings
.
<EOS>
They
're
unworthy
of
you
.
<EOS>
""It
is
the
only
way
of
arriving
at
the
truth
,
"
replied
Abel
,
"
And
nowleave
me
.
<EOS>
I
must
write
to
my
sister
about
this
Scarve
--
curse
on
thename
--
and
will
desire
her
to
interdict
her
son
from
going
near
thehouse

<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
my
humble
opinion
<EOS>
you
are
taking
the
precise
course
to
attract
himthither
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
never
desired
to
go
before
,
hewill
do
so
now
.
<EOS>
It
's
human
nature
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Tell
me
not
to
open
thatcupboard
,
and
I
should
long
to
do
it
.
<EOS>
Recollect
Bluebeard
,
Sir
.
<EOS>
""Bluebeard
be
hanged
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
Go
and
look
after
dinner
.
<EOS>
Serve
it
at
four
to
a
moment

<EOS>
I
wo
nt
wait
an
instant
for
them

not
aninstant

<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butler
bowed
and
retired
,
while
Abel
commenced
a
second
letter
tohis
sister
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Jukes
approached
the
butler
's
pantry
,
whither
he
repaired
afterquitting
his
master
,
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
voice
issue
from
it
,
singing
with
some
taste
,
but
in
a
very
affected
style
,
the
followingsnatch:--"I
have
been
in
love
,
and
in
debt
,
and
in
drink
,
This
many
and
many
a

these
are
three
plagues

enough

I
should
think

For
one
poor
mortal
to
bear
.
<EOS>
""There
's
my
rascally
nephew

Crackenthorpe

muttered
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
wontsee
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
come
upon
his
old
errand
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
the
singer
again
exalted
his
voice:--"There
's
nothing
but
money
can
cure
me
,
And
rid
me
of
all
my
pain;'Twill
pay
all

""Ay

the

Mr.

"However

,
I
must
see
him

I
suppose

My

orders
are
peremptory
.
<EOS>
""With
this
<EOS>
,
he
pushed
open
the
door
,
and
discovered
his
nephew
leaningin
a
very
careless
attitude
against
the
table
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crackenthorpe
Crippswas
a
young
man
of
about
three
-
and

twenty

of
very
dissipatedappearance
,
with
a
slim
,
well
-
proportioned
figure
,
and
tolerably
goodfeatures
,
only
marred
by
an
expression
of
cunning
and
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
wasdressed
in
a
cast

off
suit
of
his
master
's
,
and
,
being
precisely
thesame
height
,
and
nearly
the
same
make
,
as
the
renowned
beau
,
his
clothesfitted
him
remarkably
well
.
<EOS>
He
would
scarcely
have
been
taken
for
avalet
,
for
in
defiance
of
the
regulations
against
the
wearing
ofoffensive
weapons
by
footmen
,
then
somewhat
strictly
enforced
,
from
thequarrels
arising
among
those
gentry
,
he
carried
a
silver
-
hilted
sword
.
<EOS>
His
coat
was
of
scarlet
,
trimmed
with
gold
somewhat
tarnished
,
but
stillpresenting
a
sufficiently
gay
appearance
;
his
waistcoat
of
greenflowered
silk
;
his
breeches

yellow
velvet

his
cravat
was
laced
;

CHAPTER
V.--ABEL
AGAIN
CAUTIONS
HIS
NEPHEW
AGAINST
<EOS>
THE
MISER
'S
<EOS>
DAUGHTER.Uncle
Abel
did
not
join
his
nephew
and
brother
till
dinner
was
served
,
and
took
little
part
in
the
conversation
that
occurred
during
the
meal
.
<EOS>
Habituated
to
his
humours
,
Trussell
was
as
lively
and
amusing
as
ever
,
and
rattled
away
like
a
young
man
;
but
Randulph
could
not
help
beingoppressed
by
his
elder
uncle
's
grave
looks
.
<EOS>
He
also
felt
,
he
scarcelyknew
why
,
dissatisfied
with
himself
,
and
wished
to
regain
Abel
's
esteem
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
dinner
passed
off
;
the
cloth
was
removed
,
and
the
wine
placedon
the
board
.
<EOS>
The
glasses
were
filled
by
the
attentive
Mr.
Jukes
,
whotook
especial
care
that
on
this
occasion
one
of
the
oldest
and
choicestbottles
should
be
brought
forth
,
and
<EOS>
his
attention
was
speedily
rewardedby
a
very
beneficial
change
in
his
master
's
temper
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Randulph
,
"
said
Abel
,
while
sipping
his
second
glass
,
<EOS>
"
how
do
youlike
your
new
society?""I
<EOS>
have
seen
so
little
of
it
at
present
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
man,"that
<EOS>
I
can
form
no
precise
opinion
;
but
I
must
say
,
that
I
think
Mr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
the
best
bred
man
I
have
ever
met
with
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
a
womanof
infinite
spirit
and
wit
,
and
her
daughter
,
Clementina--""The
most
beautiful
creature
you
ever
beheld
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
supplied
Abel
,
laughingdrily
;
"
and
<EOS>
you
have
already
lost
your
heart
to
her
.
<EOS>
""So
far
from
thinking
her
the
most
beautiful
creature
I
ever
beheld,"returned
Randulph
,
"
she
is
not
to
compare
with
<EOS>
--
with--"He
was
about
to
add
the
name
of
the
miser
's
daughter
,
but
the
looks
ofhis
uncles
,
both
of
which
were
fixed
on
him
,
though
with
a
verydifferent
expression
,
checked
him
.
<EOS>
"I
know
what
you
are
about
to
say
,
Randulph
,
"
observed
uncle
Abel
,
sternly
;
"
you
were
going
to
mention
Hilda
Scarve
.
<EOS>
Once
for
all
,
let
mecaution
you
against
alluding
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
particular
reason
fordisliking
her
father
--
for
hating
him
,
indeed
,
for
my
feelings
towardshim
are
of
the
bitterest
kind
,
and
I
can
not
endure
to
hear
of
any
oneconnected
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
sir
,
your
wishes
shall
be
obeyed
,
so
far
as
it
is
in
my
power
toobey
them
,
"
replied
Randulph
;
"
but
I
should
not
be
dealing
frankly
withyou
,
if
I
did
not
tell
you
that
I
think
them
a
little
unreasonable
.
<EOS>
Ican
easily
understand
that
Mr.
Scarve
may
have
offended
you
,
but
hisdaughter--""Randulph
,
"
cried
Abel
,
fixing
his
grey
eye
upon
him
,
"
<EOS>
you
are
in
lovewith
that
girl
,
or
rather
,
you
fancy
yourself
so
;
for
love
,
though
sownat
once
,
requires
time
to
bring
it
to
maturity
.
<EOS>
You
must
subdue
thispassion
,
if
you
entertain
it
.
<EOS>
The
daughter
of
such
a
man
must
inheritsome
of
his
bad
qualities
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
I
think
you
are
unjust
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
grant
thatthe
father
may
be
objectionable
,
the
mother
,
whom
she
evidently
takesafter
,
may
have
been--""Randulph
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
interrupting
him
with
a
sharp
cry
,
"
wouldyou
drive
me
<EOS>
mad?""What
have
I
said
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
young
man
,
in
astonishment
.
"For
<EOS>
Heaven
's
sake
,
hold
your
tongue
!
"
<EOS>
whispered
uncle
Trussell
,
who
hadin
vain
been
endeavouring
to
attract
his
nephew
's
attention
.
"
<EOS>
Do
n't
yousee
he
ca
n't
bear
to
talk
of
these
Scarves?"Randulph
was
greatly
disconcerted
.
<EOS>
In
vain
he
tried
to
rally
;
no
subjectfor
conversation
occurred
to
him
;
but
at
last
uncle
Trussell
came
to
hisrelief
.
<EOS>
"We
are
going
to
breakfast
with
Beau
Villiers
to
-
morrow
morning
,
sir,"he
said
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"
We
were
asked
to
Lady
Fazakerly
's
drumto
-
night
;
and
Lady
Brabazon
invited
us
to
accompany
her
to
Ranelagh
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
why
did
n't
you
go
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Abel
,
peevishly
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
thought
it
might
not
be
agreeable
to
you
,
"
returnedTrussell
.
"Pshaw
!
<EOS>
what
care
I
about
it
!
"
rejoined
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
Plunge
your
charge
overhead
and
ears
in
dissipation
!
<EOS>
Surfeit
him
,
as
the
grocers
do
theirapprentices
with
sweets
!
<EOS>
Never
mind
me
in
future
.
<EOS>
Do
what
you
will
.
"Uncle
<EOS>
Trussell
winked
at
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"We'll
take
him
at
his
word
,
"
he
whispered
.
<EOS>
But
Randulph
took
no
notice
of
the
signal
.
<EOS>
His
heart
was
too
fullyoccupied
with
Hilda
Scarve
;
and
he
felt
a
rising
dislike
to
uncle
Abelwhich
he
could
not
conquer
.
<EOS>
Excusing
himself
from
taking
more
wine
,
herepaired
to
the
garden
,
and
entered
the
summer
-
house
,
where
he
gazed
atthe
broad
and
beautiful
river
flowing
past
it
,
and
the
venerable
Abbeyon
the
opposite
shore
,
near
which
she
dwelt
whom
he
now
began
toacknowledge
was
mistress
of
his
heart

<EOS>
AT
<EOS>
THE
MISER'S
--
HILDA'SOPINION
OF
HER
COUSIN.Nothing
very
particular
occurred
at
the
miser
's
dwelling
afterRandulph
's
departure
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
took
a
large
account
-
book
from
the
boxbeneath
his
table
,
together
with
several
papers
,
from
which
he
proceededto
make
extracts
;
and
he
thus
employed
himself
for
more
than
an
hour
anda
half
,
when
,
his
farthing
candle
having
burnt
down
into
the
socket
,
heintimated
to
his
daughter
and
Mrs.
Clinton
that
it
was
time
to
retire
torest
.
<EOS>
"You
have
sat
up
longer
than
usual
,
"
he
said
,
"
and
I
have
been
so
busythat
<EOS>
I
quite
forgot
to
bid
you
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Hilda
,
your
cousin
,
PhilipFrewin
,
will
dine
here
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
have
told
me
that
before
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
have
told
you
also
,
that
it
is
my
wish
you
should
receive
himgraciously
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
a
word
more
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
Good
night
,
daughter
--
<EOS>
good
night
,
sister
Clinton
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Jacob
,
light
theladies
up
stairs
!
<EOS>
I
have
settled
my
accounts
,
and
do
n't
want
thecandle
.
<EOS>
"Jacob
obeyed
,
and
the
ladies
were
conducted
to
their
room
,
to
retire
torest
,
as
usual
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
A
moment
afterwards
,
Jacob
returned
,
and
set
the
expiring
candle
on
thetable
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Jacob
?
"
said
the
miser
to
him
,
"
what
did
you
think
of
our
visitorto
-
day?""What
<EOS>
did
you
think
of
him
,
sir
?
"
returned
Jacob
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"Pretty
<EOS>
well
,
"
replied
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
"
Not
wanting
in
good
looks
--
butimprovident
--
thoughtless
in
the
extreme
.
<EOS>
""Don't
think
so
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"You're
<EOS>
no
judge
of
character
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
I
read
thespendthrift
in
his
whole
appearance
and
demeanour
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Jacob
,
Iwould
rather
see
no
more
of
him
.
<EOS>
If
he
should
call
again
,
which
is
notunlikely
,
though
I
gave
him
a
broad
enough
hint
that
his
visits
would
beanything
but
agreeable
,
you
will
deny
me
and
my
daughter
to
him
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Jacob
,
"
do
you
mean
to
shut
your
doors
against
the
sonof
your
old
friend
?
<EOS>
Is
that
acting
like
a
gentleman
,
let
alone
<EOS>
aChristian?""The
lad
is
a
scapegrace
,
Jacob
--
a
senseless
,
romantic
,
scapegrace,"rejoined
<EOS>
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Don't
think
so
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
given
away
his
fortune
,
"
said
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"He'll
<EOS>
get
it
back
in
time
,
"
was
the
rejoinder
.
<EOS>
"Jacob
<EOS>
,
you
're
a
fool
!
"
said
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Fool
or
not
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
"
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
marry
my
daughterto
that
young
man
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
I
ask
your
advice
on
the
subject
,
it
will
be
time
enough
to
offerit
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
now
retire
,
Jacob
.
<EOS>
But
first
go
overthe
house
and
see
that
all
's
safe
.
<EOS>
I
thought
I
heard
a
noise
in
thecellar
last
night
.
<EOS>
""It
was
the
rats
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
miser
;
"
then
the
rats
make
a
pretty
chatteringwith
their
jaws
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
I
suspect
it
was
you
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
it
was
me
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
you
confess
it
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
miser
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
Where
do
you
getyour
victuals
from
?
<EOS>
Who
supplies
you
with
them
,
eh?""Never
<EOS>
you
mind
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
so
as
it
does
n't
cost
youanythin
'
,
you
need
n't
care
.
<EOS>
""True
,
true
!
"
said
the
miser
;
"
and
yet
I
should
like
to
know
how
you
getyour
food
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
steal
it
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
But
see
,
the
candle
's
goin'
out
--
youhad
better
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
""You're
<EOS>
right
,
Jacob
,
"
said
the
old
man
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
night
!
<EOS>
Be
sure
you
lookto
the
house
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
he
crept
off
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
,
just
as
he
reached
it
,
the
candle
expired
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
always
arose
at
daybreak
,
and
generally
spent
two
or
threehours
before
breakfast
at
his
accounts
.
<EOS>
On
the
morning
following
theevents
previously
related
,
he
remained
longer
than
usual
in
his
ownroom
,
and
when
summoned
to
breakfast
by
Mrs.
Clinton
at
nine
o'clock
,
hedescended
with
a
large
deed
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
The
family
breakfastconsisted
of
milk
and
water
,
the
proportions
being
one
-
third
of
theformer
liquid
to
two
of
the
latter
--
a
small
loaf
of
bread
,
but
neitherbutter
nor
meat
.
<EOS>
Of
this
meagre
fare
all
parties
partook
sparingly
,
andthe
meal
was
soon
ended
.
<EOS>
Hilda
had
generally
little
appetite
,
but
onthis
occasion
she
ate
less
than
usual
,
and
her
father
remarked
it
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
you
are
not
well
to
-
day
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
for
Iwished
you
to
be
in
good
looks
to
receive
your
cousin
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
wish
to
see
him
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
look
of
inexpressibledisgust
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
you
have
no
wish
to
please
me
,
"
he
rejoined
.
<EOS>
The
miser
made
no
further
remark
at
the
time
,
but
when
the
scantyremains
of
breakfast
were
removed
,
and
he
was
left
alone
with
hisdaughter
,
he
said--"Hilda
,
I
want
a
word
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
have
long
desiredto
converse
with
you
on
a
subject
nearest
my
heart
.
<EOS>
It
relates
to
yourcousin
,
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
You
can
scarcely
be
ignorant
that
he
seeks
yourhand
.
<EOS>
But
if
you
are
ignorant
of
his
intentions
,
I
must
now
acquaint
youwith
them
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
,
not
merely
because
he
ismy
nephew
,
but
because
he
is
a
very
prudent
,
careful
person
,
and
willtake
care
of
what
he
has
got
.
<EOS>
He
is
directly
the
reverse
of
the
weak
,
young
man
who
was
here
last
night
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
he
appears
,
sir
,
"
replied
Hilda
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"Philip
<EOS>
is
very
rich
,
Hilda
,
"
pursued
the
miser
;
"
he
is
worth
fiftythousand
pounds
,
if
he
is
worth
a
penny
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
short
,
it
is
mypleasure
,
if
he
should
propose
to
you
,
as
I
expect
he
will
,
that
youaccept
him
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
is
fit
,
dear
father
,
that
you
should
know
what
my
answer
willbe
to
his
proposal
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
will
it
be
?
"
asked
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"A
positive
and
decided
refusal
,
"
she
returned
.
"Hilda
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
miser
,
furiously--"Hilda!""Do
not
urge
me
further
,
father
<EOS>
,
"
she
rejoined
,
calmly
;
"
upon
this
pointI
am
firm
.
<EOS>
""You
are
captivated
by
the
fair
face
and
showy
figure
of
the
prodigalwho
<EOS>
was
here
last
night

cried
Mr.
Scarve
,
carried
away
by
his
passion;"but
mark
me
<EOS>
,
I
will
never
consent
to
such
a
match

<EOS>
If
you

d
him

neither
he

shall
ever
havea

disinherit
you

He
is
a
beggar

abeggar
's

you
shall
be

<EOS>
If
the
fool
had
but
kept
fast
hold
of
theestates
,
all
might
have
been
well
<EOS>
--
I
might
have
consented
;
but
as
it
is
,
I
will
never
listen
to
his
suit
.
<EOS>
No
,
Hilda
,
"
he
continued
,
moderatinghimself
,
"
the
husband
for
you
is
Philip
Frewin
,
my
sister

son

<EOS>
one

the
value

money

will
take
care

""He
may
be
all
you
describe,--though
<EOS>
I
doubt
it
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
I
donot
desire

<EOS>
""Tush
!
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
impatiently--"every
woman
desires
to
marry
.
<EOS>
It
is
her
first
object
--
what
she
is
brought
up
for
--
the
end
and
aim
ofher
existence

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
surely

"
replied
Hilda
,
with
a
half
smile
,
"
every
womandesires
to

the
man

loves

<EOS>
Her
heart
must
have
something
to
dowith
her
choice

<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
"
cried
the
miser
,
"
mere
idle
talk,--mere
girl
's
fancy
.
<EOS>
Beforeyou
have
been
married
a
week
,
you
will
love
your
husband
better
than
anyman
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
A
husband
should
not
be
chosen
for
his
good
looks
,
butfor
his
good
qualities
;
for
his
pecuniary
,
rather
than
his
personaladvantages
;
and
for
his
ability
to
take
care
of
you
,
your
property
,
andyour
children
.
<EOS>
Such
a
one
is
Philip
Frewin
--
such
a
one
is
not

<EOS>
""I
wish
you
would
not
mention
Randulph
Crew
so
often
,
father

"
repliedHilda
,
in
some
little
confusion
;
"
I
do
not
understand
why
his
nameshould
be
brought
forward
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
;
"
and
I
'll
take
care
not
to
mention
itagain
.
<EOS>
But
enough
has
been
said
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
You
know
my
wishes;don't
dispute
them
.
<EOS>
Go
to
your
chamber
,
child
;
go
to
your
chamber
!
"
<EOS>
Andhe
turned
away
from
her
to
pore
over
the
deed
before
him
.
<EOS>
Hilda
gazed
athim
for
a
moment
,
irresolutely
,
and
then
sighing
deeply
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
A
guest
being
expected
at
dinner
,
some
little
preparation
was
made
.
<EOS>
Therepast
was
to
consist
of
a
few
ribs
of
beef
baked
upon
half
-
a
-
dozenpotatoes
,
followed
by
a
small
batter
pudding
,
likewise
baked
.
<EOS>
Punctually
at
two
o'clock
,
at
which
hour
the
miser
dined
,
a
knock
washeard
at
the
door
,
and
Jacob
,
answering
the
summons
,
admitted
a
tall
,
thin
young
man
,
with
very
sharp
features
,
dressed
in
an
old
worn
-
outgrey
cloth
coat
,
with
plated
metal
buttons
,
that
might
have
belonged
tohis
grandfather
;
a
tattered
plush
waistcoat
;
darned
worsted
hose
;
ascratch
wig
,
looking
as
if
it
had
been
picked
up
in
the
kennel
;
and
oldshoes
,
with
high
quarters
fastened
by
small
iron
buckles
.
<EOS>
Thisextraordinary
personage
was
welcomed
with
great
cordiality
by
his
uncle
,
who
seemed
to
contemplate
his
miserable
appearance
with
the
utmostsatisfaction
.
<EOS>
Hilda
,
however
,
would
scarcely
behave
civilly
to
him
,
though
the
youngman
paid
her
great
attention
,
and
whenever
her
father
's
back
was
turned
,
put
on
a
manner
that
filled
her
with
disgust
.
<EOS>
At
the
close
of
dinner
,
the
miser
called
for
wine
,
and
a
bottle
was
brought
him
,
containingbarely
a
glass
,
as
was
proved
when
Jacob
poured
it
out
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarvepressed
his
nephew
to
take
it
,
but
the
young
man
declined
.
<EOS>
The
miserthen
raised
the
glass
to
his
lips
,
but
put
it
down
untasted
,
observing--"No
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
require
it
--
<EOS>
indeed
,
I
am
better
without
it
.
<EOS>
Putit
back
again
,
Jacob
.
<EOS>
I
drink
your
health
,
nephew
,
in
a
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
return
the
pledge
in
the
same
wholesome
beverage
,
"
returnedPhilip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
"
I
never
take
any
other
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
ogling
Hilda
inan
intolerable
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
drink
to
you
,
fair
cousin
,
"
and
as
he
spoke
hegulped
down
a
large
draught
,
but
with
a
very
bad
grace
.
<EOS>
"I
do
n't
think
for
all
he
says
that
he
's
accustomed
to
such
draughts,"thought
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
He
does
n't
look
like
a
waterdrinker
.
<EOS>
"Dinner
<EOS>
was
no
sooner
over
than
Hilda
withdrew
with
her
aunt
to
her
ownroom
;
nor
would
she
,
though
her
father
sent
Jacob
to
summon
her
,
return
.
<EOS>
"Girls
<EOS>
have
strange
fancies
,
Philip
,
"
he
said
,
to
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hermother
was
just
as
whimsical
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
,
though
she
married
me
,
thatshe
cared
for
me
.
<EOS>
""Since
I
have
your
consent
to
the
match
,
sir
,
that
is
all
I
care
for,"replied
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
Love
will
come
in
good
time

<EOS>
My
cousin
Hilda
is
acharming
girl

and
would
be
a
prize
without
a
penny
,
but
with
what
youpropose
to
give
her--""To

Philip

<EOS>

<EOS>
"
I
shall
give
her
nothing

my

<EOS>
""Not

any

"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
the
miser
;
"
but
I
shall
require
a
settlement
onyour
part

<EOS>
You
are
rich
,
Philip
,
and
can
make
a
good
settlement

<EOS>
""No
settlement

your
part
,
uncle

"
<EOS>
muttered
Frewin
,
"
and
a
large
onedemanded
on
mine

<EOS>
This
requires
consideration
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
it
does
n't
,
"
said
the
miser
,
sharply
;
"
for
if
you
hesitate
,
yousha'n't
have
her

<EOS>
My
daughter
shall
not
be
refused
by

You

<EOS>
""I
will
gladly
take

so
,
uncle

replied
Philip
.
<EOS>
"You
will
do
wisely

"
rejoined
the
miser
,
more
calmly
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
I'vegood
news
for
you
,
Phil
--
rare
news
!
<EOS>
You
know
--
for
our
attorney
,
Diggs
,
will
have
told
you
--
that
I
have
advanced
fourteen
thousand
pounds
to
SirBulkeley
Price
on
the
mortgage
of
one
of
his
estates
in
Flintshire
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
estate
is
worth
upwards
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
--
perhaps
more
,
because
there
are
several
copper
mines
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Well
,
I
have
given
SirBulkeley
notice
to
pay
over
the
money
.
<EOS>
He
has
paid
no
attention
to
theapplication
;
and
if
I
do
not
receive
the
money
at
six
o'clock
,
at
whichhour
it
must
be
paid
or
tendered
,
I
shall
foreclose
--
yes
,
foreclose
,
nephew
--
and
the
estates
will
become
mine
--
your
wife
's
hereafter
,
andyour
children's
.
<EOS>
""And
mine
,
"
thought
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
sincerely
congratulate
you
,
uncle

headded
,
aloud
,
"
and
hope
nothing
may
happen
to
deprive
you
of
yourrights

<EOS>
""Nothing
is
likely
to
happen
now
,
Philip
,
"
replied
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
"
Theestate
is
as
good
as
my
own
--
I
have
just
been
reading
over
thedescription
of
it

and
a
noble
estate
it
is
.
<EOS>
Butsince
Hilda
wo

""I
am
glad

hear

Philip

I
almostbegan
to

there
might
be
a
rival

case

<EOS>
""A

cried
the
miser
,
with
a
slightly
embarrassed
look

<EOS>
"It
is
true
that
Mr.

called

""Indeed

then
ushered

Jacob

surlily

conducted
him

"That

he
muttered
,
"
if

<EOS>
"On
reaching
King

street
,
Philip
Frewin
snapped
his
fingers
derisively
inthe
air

quickening
his
pace

he
reached

doorof

Wine

yard

in

street

entering
it

proceeded
at
once
to
a
private
room
.
<EOS>
Then
,
bursting
into
a
loud
laugh
,
he
dashed
his
old
wig
to
the
ground
,
and
trampled
upon
it
;
threw
off
histattered
coat
and
waistcoat
,
and
proceeded
to
rid
himself
of
the
rest
ofhis
attire
.
<EOS>
He
next
equipped
himself
in
a
smart
suit
of
green
velvet
,
put
on
a
campaign
wig
,
and
added
lace
ruffles
to
his
shirt

<EOS>
"I

part

My

will
like
me
all

bore
her
father

ameekness
that

it

asked
the

"By

too

pursued
the

not
choosing
to
notice

remark

what
is
better

CHAPTER
VII.--THE
PAYMENT
OF
THE
MORTGAGE
<EOS>
MONEY.Nearly
an
hour
having
elapsed
,
Mr.
Scarve
arose
,
and
called
to
Jacob
,
who
had
retired
to
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
The
summons
not
being
answered
asexpeditiously
as
he
desired
,
he
called
again
,
and
Jacob
made
hisappearance
,
brushing
the
moisture
from
his
lips
,
and
trying
to
swallowdown
a
huge
morsel
that
stuck
in
his
throat
.
<EOS>
"You
have
been
eating
,
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
miser
,
"
and
drinking
,
too!Faugh
!
<EOS>
how
the
knave
smells
of
beer!""If
<EOS>
I
have
been
eatin
'
and
drinkin
'
"
said
Jacob
,
clearing
his
throat
bya
violent
effort
<EOS>
,
"
it
has
n't
been
at
your
expense
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
go
and
see
what
's
o'clock
,
"
said
the
miser
,
who
did
not
appearparticularly
angry
.
<EOS>
"What
's
o'clock
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jacob
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
I
've
lived
withyou
these
twenty
years
,
and
never
was
sent
on
such
a
message
before
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
to
know
what
's
o'clock
<EOS>
for?""What
's
that
to
you
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
with
more
anger
in
hiswords
than
in
his
tones
or
looks
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
tell
you

I

my

so
much

do
this?""You

"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
Why
do
you

replied
the

<EOS>
"
It
must
now
be

in

Jacob

put

<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
it
'll
be
the
first

so
drunk

Jacob

<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
care
it
is

the
last

you
thankless
varlet

<EOS>
"
rejoined
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
stand
chattering
there
!
<EOS>
Go
and
see
what
's
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
Jacob
departed
to
obey
his
injunction
,
Mr.
Scarve
paced
to
and
frowithin
the
room
,
rubbing
his
hands
,
and
chuckling
to
himself
.
<EOS>
Fiveminutes
nearly
elapsed
before
Jacob
returned
;
and
when
he
did
so
,
it
waswith
a
countenance
of
very
peculiar
significance
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
is
it
five
?
"
cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"No
;
it
's
fourteen
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
"Fourteen
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
What
do
you
mean
?
<EOS>
You
're
drunk
,
sirrah
--
drunk
on
the
promise
of
a
glass
of
wine
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
'm
not
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
that
there
's
a
troop
of
fourteenhorsemen
at
the
door

<EOS>
There!--don't
<EOS>
you
hear
'em
?
<EOS>
They
make
noiseenough
,
I
should
think
.
<EOS>
"And
as
he
spoke
,
a
loud
knocking
,
mixed
with
shouts
and
laughter
,
camesounding
down
the
passage
.
<EOS>
"It
is
the
mortgage

money
,
father
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"It
is
--
damnation
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
miser
,
stamping
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
first
I
took
the
troop
for
a
gang
of
highwaymen
,
"
said
Jacob
,
"
whentheir

""Curses

they

And

why

<EOS>
They'vebrought

it
in

bags

of
five
hundred

<EOS>
""Five

foaming
with
rage

""That

rejoined
Jacob
;
"
they
're
all
at

There

exclaimed
Hilda

"
why

<EOS>
SirBulkeley

<EOS>
""What

cried
the

<EOS>
"Not

Jacob

"Oh

<EOS>
Nay

"
<EOS>
Andopening
a
side
-
door
,
he
rushed
up
a
small
flight
of
steps
leading
to
hisbedroom
.
<EOS>
"Some
mischief
will
happen
,
Jacob
,
"
cried
Hilda
,
with
a
terrified
look
.
<EOS>
"I
never
saw
my

so
agitated
before
.
<EOS>
I
'll
go
forth
myself

andentreat
Sir

to

<EOS>
""Don't
expose
yourself
to
the
insults
of
his
servants

,
"
rejoinedJacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
did
not
tell
master
a
quarter
what
they
said
of
him
.
"But
<EOS>
despite
his
entreaties
,
and
those
of
her
aunt
,
who
also
endeavouredto
detain
her
,
she
rushed
forth
,
followed
by
Jacob
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
the
street
,
Hilda
found
Jacob
's
statement
perfectly
correct
.
<EOS>
A
troop
of
fourteen
horsemen
,
with
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
at
their
head
,
were
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Most
of
them
were
well
mounted
,
though
a
few
of
the
number
rode
stout
Welch
ponies
.
<EOS>
All
had
swords
attheir
sides
,
and
pistols
in
their
holsters
,
as
was
needful
from
theamount
of
money
they
carried
;
every
man
having
been
provided
with
twobags
,
each
containing
five
hundred
pounds
in
gold
,
slung
over
hissaddle
-
bow
.
<EOS>
A
pile
of
these
precious
sacks
lay
at
the
door
,
and
some
ofthe
men
were
now
adding
to
the
heap
,
while
others
were
unslinging
bagsfrom
their
comrades
'
saddles
.
<EOS>
The
whole
company
were
in
high
glee
,
andlaughing
loudly
.
<EOS>
The
leader
of
the
troop
.
<EOS>
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
was
astout
,
portly
gentleman
,
whose
swollen
inflamed
cheeks
and
mulberry
noseshowed
<EOS>
he
was
by
no
means
indifferent
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
Aclaret

,
buttoned
to
the
throat
,
displayedhis
full
chest
and
rather
commanding
figure
to
advantage
;
while
awell
-
powdered
,
full

bottomed
perriwig
contrasted
strongly
with
hisrubicund
and
fiery
visage
.
<EOS>
Hilda
's
appearance
created
a
great
sensationamong
the
lookers
-
on
,
and
especially
attracted
the
attention
of
thebarber
,
who
was
chattering
with
Mr.
Deacle
about
the
occurrence
,
and
ofthe
fair
Thomasine
,
who
was
leaning
out
of
an
upper
window
,
<EOS>
just
aboveher
father
's
sign
of
the
Three
Pigeons
.
<EOS>
"There
's
Miss
Scarve
!
"
cried
Peter
,
calling
to
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
her
,
"
replied
the
mercer
's
daughter
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
thing
,
how
I
pityher
--
to
be
exposed
to
such
insults
!
<EOS>
I
long
to
fly
to
her
assistance
.
<EOS>
""Do
,
do

"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
fly
with
you
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
,
do
n't
,
"
said
Mr.
Deacle
;
"
you
had
better
not
interfere

<EOS>
Lord
blessme
!
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
it
all
means

<EOS>
"Heedless
of
what
was
passing
around
her
,
for
she
heard
her
father'sfurious
voice
in
the
passage
,
Hilda
rushed
towards
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
and
,
in
a
tone
of
the
most
earnest
entreaty
,
cried
,
"
Oh
,
sir
,
I
imploreyou
to
go
away
!
<EOS>
My
father
is
fearfully
incensed
--
some
mischief
willhappen!""You
are
Mr.
Scarve
's
daughter
,
I
presume
?
"
returned
Sir
Bulkeley
,
politely
taking
off
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"
I
should
never
have
suspected
him
ofowning
aught
so
beautiful
.
<EOS>
But
why
should
I
go
away
,
Miss
Scarve
?
<EOS>
I
ammerely
come
to
pay
your
father
a
sum
of
money
which
I
borrowed
fromhim
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
it
is
the
manner
of
paying
it
,
sir,--the
public
manner,--theexposure
that
incenses
him
,
"
cried
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
for
twice
theamount
,
that
this
had
happened
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
dare
say
not
,
"
replied
Sir
Bulkeley
;
"
but
your
father
has
forced
meinto
the
measure
.
<EOS>
My
estate
would
have
been
forfeited
if
I
had
notrepaid
the
money
by
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
It
is
as
unpleasant
to
me
as
it
can
beto
him
;
but
I
had
no
alternative
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
a
loud
,
angry
cry
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
the
miserappeared
,
brandishing
his
drawn
sword
at
it
.
<EOS>
His
mad
career
was
opposedby
Jacob
,
whose
wig
was
knocked
off
in
his
endeavours
to
push
himbackwards
.
"Villain
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
miser
,
shaking
his
hand
at
Sir
Bulkeley
,
"
villain
,
you
shall
repent
your
insolence
!
<EOS>
Release
me
,
Jacob
!
<EOS>
Let
me
get
at
him?""No
you
sha'n't
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Jacob
,
who
had
to
exert
all
his
strength
,
suchwas
the
miser
's
fury
,
to
keep
him
back
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
's
vociferations
of
rage
were
now
drowned
by
the
hootings
andjeers
of
the
Welch
baronet
's
attendants
,
who
did
all
in
their
power
toincense
him
further
.
<EOS>
Terrified
by
the
cries
,
Hilda
clasped
her
hands
inagony
,
and
again
addressed
herself
to
Sir
Bulkeley
.
<EOS>
"As
you
are
a
gentleman
,
sir
,
I
beseech
you
to
withdraw
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"Such
<EOS>
an
appeal
,
and
from
such
lips
,
is
irresistible

"
replied
SirBulkeley
,
again
raising
his
hat
.
<EOS>
"He
is
no

Hilda
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
her
father
,
who
overheard
what
wassaid
.
<EOS>
"
Come
away
,
girl
<EOS>
,
I
command
you
--
leave
him
to
me!""Well
crowed
,
old
cock

"
<EOS>
cried
one
of
the
attendants
,
in
mockery
.
<EOS>
Andall
laughed
jeeringly
,
as
before
.
<EOS>
"Hold
<EOS>
your
tongues
,
you
saucy
knaves
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
,
fiercely
regardingthem
;
"
or
,
as
soon
as
I
'm
at
liberty
,
I
'll
break
some
of
your
addlepates

<EOS>
""For

"
<EOS>
cried
Hilda
to
the
baronet
,
"
and
take
themoney
with
you
.
<EOS>
Another
time
will
do
for
payment
.
<EOS>
""Pardon
me
<EOS>
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
replied
Sir
Bulkeley
;
"
another
time
will
notdo
.
<EOS>
I
must
n't
jeopardise
my
estate.--Mr

<EOS>
Scarve

"
he
shouted
to
themiser
,
"
here
is
your
money
--
fourteen
thousand
pounds
,
ingold.--Friends
,
"
he
added
,
looking
round
at
the
crowd
of
spectators
inthe
street
,
and
at
the
windows
,
"
I
call
you
all
to
witness
,
that
thismoney
is
paid
before
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
will
take
your
word
,
Miss
Scarve
,
for
a
receipt
,
and
for
the
delivering
up
of
the
mortgage
deeds
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
hence
your
money
,
villain
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
the
miser
,
"
I
want
none
ofit
.
<EOS>
"This
exclamation
was
followed
by
a
roar
of
derisive
laughter
from
thebaronet
's
attendants
.
<EOS>
"Silence
<EOS>
them
--
<EOS>
oh
,
silence
them
,
sir
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hilda
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
Sir
Bulkeley
looked
majestically
round
,
and
his
attendants
becameinstantly
mute
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
Jacob
forced
Mr.
Scarve
into
thehouse
;
and
Hilda
,
hastily
expressing
her
thanks
to
the
baronet
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
,
the
whole
of
the
bags
of
money
werecollected
,
and
placed
on
the
threshold
.
<EOS>
Sir
Bulkeley
would
not
,
however
,
depart
till
Jacob
returned
,
when
he
committed
the
heap
to
his
custody
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
you
done
with
your
master
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"He
has
fainted
,
and
his
daughter
is
tending
him
.
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
take
him
that
restorative
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Bulkeley
,
pointing
tothe
money
-
bags
;
"
it
will
speedily
revive
him
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
rode
off
with
his
followers
,
amid
the
acclamations
of
thespectators
.
<EOS>
The
same
persons
next
began
to
hoot
Jacob
,
and
even
seemeddisposed
to
assail
him
;
but
being
now
provided
with
his
crabstick
,
hepresented
such
a
menacing
and
formidable
appearance
,
that
those
nearesthim
slunk
off
.
<EOS>
In
the
hurry
of
the
moment
,
it
has
been
omitted
to
mention
,
that
whenHilda
retired
,
the
fair
Thomasine
uttered
a
scream
,
and
fainted
.
<EOS>
Madeaware
of
the
circumstance
,
both
by
the
cry
and
the
disappearance
of
themercer
and
his
wife
from
the
windows
,
Peter
Pokerich
quitted
his
owndwelling
,
and
flew
to
render
aid
.
<EOS>
With
some
little
difficulty
,
thesensitive
damsel
was
brought
to
herself
;
but
when
restored
toconsciousness
,
she
was
very
palpitating
and
hysterical
,
and
leanedagainst
the
wall
,
with
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
in
the
attitude
of
atragic
heroine
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
the
indignities
that
that
sweet
creature
has
endured
!
"
<EOS>
she
gasped
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
is
a
model
of
filial
piety
,
and
more
to
be
admired
than
the
GrecianDaughter
.
<EOS>
""Much
<EOS>
more
,
"
said
Peter
,
"
though
I
do
n't
recollect
the
particularattractions
of

<EOS>
""Would
<EOS>

were
her
friend

"
<EOS>
cried
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"
Would
I
might
pourmy
sorrows
into
her
sympathetic
bosom!""What

asked
the
barber

An
hysterical
sob
was
all
the
fair
Thomasine
's
answer
.
<EOS>
"Fourteen
thousand
pounds
!
"
exclaimed
Peter
,
almost
unconsciously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Whata
fortune
Hilda
Scarve
will
be!""She
would
be
a
fortune
without
a
farthing
,
"
cried
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
Meantime
the
crowd
dispersed
;
but
not
before
Jacob
had
noticed
somesuspicious
-
looking
personages
eyeing
the
bags
of
treasure
lying
at
thedoor
in
a
very
alarming
manner
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
have
to
keep
strict
watch
to
-
night
,
"
he
thought
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
publicdelivery
of
money
as
this
is
almost
an
inducement
to
robbery
.
<EOS>
We
oughtto
have
a
couple
of
watchmen
.
<EOS>
"Thus
ruminating
,
he
removed
the
whole
of
the
bags
,
twenty
-
eight
innumber
,
and
each
containing
five
hundred
pounds
,
into
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Hethen
locked
,
bolted
,
and
barred
the
door
,
and
afterwards
conveyed
thetreasure
into
the
room
generally
used
by
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
The
miser
,
as
he
had
stated
to
Sir
Bulkeley
,
had
fainted
.
<EOS>
The
unhappyman
recovered
just
as
Jacob
brought
in
the
last
two
bags
,
and
seeing
thetreasure
before
him
,
uttered
a
wild
shriek
,
broke
from
his
daughter
andsister
-
in
-
law
,
who
were
tending
him
,
and
,
throwing
himself
upon
theheap
,
relapsed
into
insensibility

CHAPTER
VIII.--THE
MYSTERIOUS
LETTER
--
THE
LANDLORD
OF
THE
ROSE
AND
CROWN
--
<EOS>
CORDWELLFIREBRAS.It
will
now
be
necessary
for
a
short
space
to
retrace
the
current
of
ourstory
.
<EOS>
Peter
Pokerich
,
as
related
in
a
previous
chapter
,
crossed
over
tohis
own
house
with
the
letter
he
had
abstracted
from
Randulph'ssaddle
-
bags
,
and
immediately
proceeding
to
examine
it
,
found
it
wasaddressed
to
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
,
at
the
Rose
and
Crown
,
Gardiner's
-
street
,
Petty
France
.
<EOS>
This
not
tending
greatly
to
enlightenhim
he
tried
to
obtain
a
peep
at
its
contents
by
pressing
down
the
sidesbetween
his
finger
and
thumb
;
but
not
being
able
to
make
out
anything
inthis
way
his
curiosity
got
the
master
of
him
,
and
he
broke
the
seal
;
butso
dexterously
and
carefully
that
he
felt
confident
that
he
couldrestore
it
to
its
original
appearance
if
needful
.
<EOS>
He
then
read
asfollows:--FRIEND
<EOS>
CORDWELL,--The
bearer
of
this
is
just
the
young
man
you
want
.
<EOS>
He
's
a
bold
rider
;
always
in
at
the
death
;
and
as
rash
and
daring
as
ouryoung
squire
himself
.
<EOS>
The
game
I
sent
you
was
seized
by
the
keepers
,
asperhaps
you
have
heard
;
but
I
'll
forward
another
basket
shortly
by
asafer
conveyance
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
in
a
hurry
about
coming
over
to
us
;
and
tellthe
young
squire
<EOS>
we
ca
n't
promise
him
much
sport
this
season
.
<EOS>
The
gameis
pretty
plenty
,
but
our
kennel
is
but
thinly
stocked
--
<EOS>
The
old
pack
isnearly
broken
up
<EOS>
;
Talbot
and
Ringwood
have
been
'
ticed
away
by
oldGeorge
's
keeper
;
and
we
shall
do
no
good
unless
the
great
squire
ont'other
side
of
the
river
will
send
us
a
strong
pack
of
harriers
,
of
theFrench
breed
.
<EOS>
We
want
some
Scotch
terriers
sadly
,
for
the
rats
aregreatly
on
the
increase
.
<EOS>
If
the
young
squire
can
manage
this
,
the
soonerhe
comes
the
better
,
but
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
I
again
advise
you
toengage
the
bearer
of
this
letter.--Your
assured
friend
,
NED
<EOS>
POYNTON.This
letter
was
a
complete
enigma
to
the
barber
.
<EOS>
He
read
it
over
andover
again
,
but
could
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
.
<EOS>
He
could
nothelp
thinking
that
more
was
meant
than
met
the
eye
,
but
still
he
couldnot
penetrate
the
mystery
.
<EOS>
He
determined
,
however
,
to
call
the
nextmorning
at
the
Rose
and
Crown
to
make
some
inquiries
after
Mr.
CordwellFirebras
,
whose
name
had
something
extraordinary
about
it
that
piquedhis
curiosity
;
and
with
this
intention
he
retired
to
rest
.
"After
<EOS>
all
,
"
said
Peter
,
as
he
laid
his
head
on
his
pillow
,
"
<EOS>
I
shouldn'twonder
if
that
young
man
turned
out
to
be
a
poacher
.
<EOS>
Now
I
think
of
it
,
he
certainly
looks
like
one
.
<EOS>
Nobody
but
a
poacher
would
prefer
his
ownhair
to
a
wig
.
<EOS>
"Sallying
<EOS>
forth
betimes
the
next
morning
<EOS>
,
he
repaired
to
the
Rose
andCrown
,
which
was
but
a
short
distance
from
his
own
dwelling
,
andenquired
from
a
potboy
at
the
door
whether
a
gentleman
of
the
name
ofCordwell
Firebras
lodged
there
.
<EOS>
The
potboy
could
give
him
no
answer
,
but
,
applying
to
the
chamberlain
,
he
was
told
that
Mr.
Firebrasfrequented
the
house
,
but
did
not
lodge
there
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
generally
comes
in
the
evening
,
"
said
the
man
;
"
and
if
you
have
anymessage
to
leave
for
him
,
I
will
deliver
it
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
the
chamberlain
could
reply
,
the
landlord
made
his
appearance
,
and
on
being
informed
of
the
barber
's
inquiry
,
asked
him
what
he
wantedwith
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"A
gentleman
who
has
a
letter
for
him
called
at
my
shop
last
night,"said
<EOS>
Peter
,
"
and
wished
me
to
enquire
whether
he
was
still
here
;
that'sall
.
<EOS>
""Pray
step
this
way
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
the
landlord
,
ushering
Peter
into
aninner
room
.
<EOS>
Here
the
landlord
took
up
a
chair
,
and
,
knocking
it
three
times
on
thefloor
,
without
offering
it
to
his
guest
,
sat
down
.
<EOS>
Not
exactly
knowingwhat
to
make
of
this
singular
reception
<EOS>
,
Peter
took
up
a
chair
,
knockedit
in
like
manner
,
and
sat
down
opposite
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
thentapped
his
nose
,
and
Peter
,
not
to
be
behindhand
,
imitated
the
gesture
.
<EOS>
"All
's
right
,
"
said
the
landlord.--"All
's
right
,
"
echoed
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
did
you
leave
them
?
"
asked
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"Leave
<EOS>
whom
?
"
asked
Peter
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
's
countenancealtered
,
and
he
looked
hard
at
him
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
wigs
<EOS>
do
you
wear
,
friend
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"On
week
days
a
minor
bob
,
and
on
Sundays
or
holidays
a
bag
,
"
repliedPeter
,
in
increased
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Hark
ye
,
friend
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
eyeing
his
guest
with
somesuspicion
,
"
can
you
tell
me
where
the
king
is?""At
Saint
James
's
Palace
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
"
replied
Peter
,
innocently
.
<EOS>
"To
be
sure
!
"
<EOS>
replied
the
landlord
,
laughing
,
and
getting
<EOS>
up--"To
besure
!
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
sir!""Stop
,
stop
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
,
"
I
did
n't
come
here
to
answer
idle
questions
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
something
about
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
""I
know
nothing
about
him
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
landlord
,
evasively--"youmust
apply
elsewhere
.
<EOS>
"Thus
<EOS>
baffled
,
Peter
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
own
dwelling
;
and
hismind
was
so
fully
occupied
with
Randulph
Crew
and
the
mysteriousCordwell
Firebras
,
that
he
could
scarcely
attend
to
his
business
.
<EOS>
Aboutfour
o'clock
,
as
he
was
sitting
in
his
shop
,
combing
out
a
flaxenperriwig
,
Mr.
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
came
in
,
and
flinging
himself
into
aseat
,
said,--"Scatter
some
pulvilio
over
me
,
Pokerich
;
for
the
tar
andpaint
of
the
wherry
I
have
just
quitted
,
has
quite
overcome
me
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
recovered
breath
<EOS>
,
the
valet
then
proceeded
to
explain
thebusiness
with
which
he
had
been
charged
by
his
uncle
,
and
he
found
aready
agent
in
the
barber
,
who
,
however
,
explained
to
him
the
difficultyof
obtaining
any
precise
information
of
what
passed
in
the
miser'sdwelling
.
<EOS>
While
discussing
this
matter
,
it
occurred
to
Peter
that
Mr
.
Cripps
was
a
proper
person
to
consult
about
the
mysterious
letter
.
<EOS>
Heknew
that
the
valet
was
a
person
of
no
particular
scruples
,
and
might
besafely
confided
in
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
shewed
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
readit
over
twice
or
thrice
,
and
at
last
said--"Egad
,
I
can
not
tell
what
tomake
of
it
,
but
I
'll
soon
find
out
the
meaning
of
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
Make
it
upagain
,
and
I
'll
deliver
it
myself
to
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
will
you
take
it
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
barber
,
after
he
had
carefullyfastened
up
the
seal
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
once
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
in
the
humour
for
an
adventure
.
<EOS>
I'llreturn
directly
and
report
my
success
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
accordingly
set
forth
,
and
encountering
an
empty
chair
as
he
enteredthe
area
in
front
of
the
Abbey
,
got
into
it
,
and
told
the
bearers
toproceed
to
the
Rose
and
Crown
.
<EOS>
Arrived
there
,
with
all
the
assurance
hecould
muster
,
he
strutted
into
the
bar
,
and
flourishing
his
cane
,
inquired
for
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
stared
at
him
somewhatsuspiciously
,
but
returned
no
answer
;
and
Mr.
Cripps
calling
to
mind
thebarber
's
account
of
his
interview
,
took
up
a
chair
,
as
if
accidentally
,
and
struck
it
thrice
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
This
operation
acted
like
magic
onthe
landlord
.
<EOS>
He
made
a
peculiar
sign
in
return
,
and
said,--"He
's
nothere
now
,
sir
;
indeed
he
seldom
visits
us
,
except
in
an
evening
.
<EOS>
Butyou'll
find
him
at
his
lodgings
,
in
Ship
-
yard
,
not
a
stone
's
throw
fromthis
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
as
Cripps
bowed
in
acknowledgment,--"the
club
meets
here
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
Does
it
meet
every
night?""Every
Friday
night
at
eleven
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
But
may
I
askyou
,
sir
,
where
the
king
is?""Over
<EOS>
the
water
,
"
rejoined
Cripps
.
<EOS>
And
he
thought
to
himself
,
"
I
havestumbled
upon
a
nice
Jacobite
's
nest
now
,
i'faith
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
see
it
's
all
right
,
"
said
the
landlord
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
And
he
accompaniedthe
valet
to
the
door
,
ushered
him
to
his
chair
,
and
told
the
bearerswhere
to
take
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
speedily
arrived
at
his
destination
,
andwas
deposited
at
the
door
of
a
very
small
and
unpretending
-
lookinghouse
.
<EOS>
A
middle
aged
woman
of
respectable
appearance
answered
his
knock
,
and
informed
him
that
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
lodged
there
,
but
she
wasnot
certain
whether
he
was
within
.
<EOS>
Judging
from
her
manner
that
she
onlywished
to
ascertain
whether
her
lodger
would
receive
him
,
<EOS>
Mr.
Crippsthought
it
better
to
secure
the
interview
by
delivering
his
credentials
.
<EOS>
He
did
so
accordingly
,
and
the
result
was
as
he
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Shereturned
in
a
few
minutes
,
saying
that
Mr.
Firebras
was
at
home
,
andwould
be
happy
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
Mustering
all
his
resolution
,
Mr.
Cripps
strutted
after
her
,
and
wasushered
into
a
small
room
,
in
which
was
a
middle
-
aged
gentleman
,
whoimmediately
advanced
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
had
sufficient
knowledge
ofthe
world
to
see
at
once
that
he
had
a
very
dangerous
person
to
dealwith
,
and
that
it
behoved
him
to
be
careful
how
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
Never
hadhe
seen
such
broad
shoulders
,
such
muscular
legs
,
and
such
a
burlyframe
,
as
was
possessed
by
the
individual
before
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
CordwellFirebras
was
a
little
below
the
middle
height
,
and
his
squareness
offigure
,
aided
by
a
loose
coat
of
dark
brown
cloth
,
edged
with
silver
,
which
reached
halfway
down
his
legs
,
made
him
look
almost
as
broad
aslong
.
<EOS>
His
features
were
somewhat
coarse
,
his
cheek
bones
high
,
hiscomplexion
light
,
and
his
beard
,
brows
,
and
eyelashes
of
a
sandy
hue
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
he
had
the
look
of
a
Scotsman
.
<EOS>
His
chin
was
large
and
broad
,
evincing
the
utmost
determination
,
mixed
with
considerable
craftiness;his
mouth
wide
;
his
nose
broad
and
flat
;
and
his
eyes
of
a
light
gray
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
flaxen
bob
wig
,
which
harmonized
well
with
his
lightcomplexion
,
and
carried
a
broad
-
bladed
sword
,
evidently
intended
morefor
use
than
ornament
.
<EOS>
To
this
,
not
very
prepossessing
,
exterior
,
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cordwell
Firebras
added
easy
,
affable
,
and
almost
graceful
manners
.
<EOS>
Itwas
quite
clear
to
Mr.
Cripps
that
he
was
acting
upon
the
instructionsof
his
correspondent
,
for
he
received
him
with
the
greatest
cordiality
,
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
and
motioned
him
to
be
seated
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
escapeMr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
,
in
the
hasty
survey
he
took
of
the
room
,
that
there
was
abasket
-
hilted
sword
in
the
corner
,
together
with
a
brace
oflong
-
barrelled
silver
-
mounted
pistols
,
and
a
Highland
dirk
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
hefail
to
notice
that
the
window
opened
upon
a
small
garden
,
skirtingSaint
James
's
Park
,
thus
offering
a
ready
means
of
escape
,
if
required
.
<EOS>
These
things
considered
,
Mr.
Cripps
did
not
feel
entirely
at
his
ease
,
and
it
required
all
his
effrontery
to
enable
him
to
go
through
with
thispart
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
that
Cordwell
Firebras
perceived
his
uneasiness
,
orthat
his
quick
perception
of
character
detected
the
imposition
attemptedto
be
practised
upon
him
is
immaterial
,
but
his
countenance
suddenlychanged
,
and
the
affable
,
almost
courtier
-
like
manner
with
which
he
hadcommenced
,
gave
way
to
a
stern
scrutinizing
glance
and
chillingdemeanour
that
made
the
valet
tremble
.
<EOS>
They
were
alone
,
for
having
ushered
Cripps
into
the
room
,
the
elderlyfemale
retired
,
closing
the
door
after
her
.
<EOS>
"You
are
lately
from
the
country
,
sir
,
I
believe
?
"
asked
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Just
arrived
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
,
taking
out
his
snuff
-
box
tohide
his
confusion
,
"
allow
me
to
offer
you
a
pinch
.
<EOS>
"Firebras
bowed
,
and
accepted
the
offer
.
<EOS>
A
peculiar
smile
,
which
thevalet
did
not
like
,
crossed
his
features
.
<EOS>
"I
must
compliment
you
upon
your
air
and
manner
,
sir
,
"
said
Firebras
,
ina
tone
of
slight
irony
;
"
they
are
anything
but
rustic
.
<EOS>
But
may
I
now
askwhom
<EOS>
I
have
the
honour
of
addressing?""Mr
.
<EOS>
Randulph
Crew
!
"
replied
the
valet
;
confidently
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
Crew
!
"
exclaimed
Firebras
,
almost
starting
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
the
son
ofmy
old
friend
,
Randulph
Crew
?
<EOS>
Impossible!""I
am
not
aware
whether
my
father
enjoyed
the
honour
of
your
friendship
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
valet
,
who
began
to
fear
he
had
got
on
ticklishground
,
"
but
my
name
is
Randulph
Crew
,
and
so
was
my
father
's
beforeme
.
"Though
<EOS>
the
day
was
by
no
means
chilly
,
there
was
a
small
fire
burning
inthe
grate
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
placed
the
letter
which
he
held
in
hishand
before
it
,
and
certain
lines
of
writing
,
traced
in
invisible
ink
,
instantly
appeared
.
<EOS>
These
he
eagerly
scanned
.
<EOS>
"It
is
useless
to
trifle
long
,
sir
,
"
he
cried
,
turning
suddenly
upon
thevalet
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
For
what
purpose
are
you
come
hither?Answer
me
,
or
your
life
shall
pay
the
forfeit
of
your
rashness
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
drew
his
sword
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
,
though
greatly
alarmed
,
drewlikewise
,
but
his
blade
was
instantly
struck
from
his
grasp
by
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Raise
<EOS>
a
cry
,
and
you
are
a
dead
man
,
"
pursued
Firebras
,
locking
thedoor
,
and
putting
the
key
in
his
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
,
sirrah?""My
name
is
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
,
and
I
am
chief
valet
to
BeauVilliers
,
"
returned
the
other
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
"You
are
a
spy
,
rascal
,
"
cried
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
come
on
an
errand
,
ofthe
danger
of
which
you
were
ignorant

<EOS>
But
you
will
get
nothing

yourpains

<EOS>
""Pardon
me
,
Mr.
Firebras
,
"
said
the
valet
,
who
was
by
no
means
destituteof
courage
,
or
,
at
all
events
,
of
the
quality

have
gained
my
object
.
<EOS>
I
have
discovered
theexistence
of
a
Jacobite
club
,
of
which
you
are
a
member
.
<EOS>
I
havediscovered
that
there
is
a
plot
hatching
in
Cheshire
,
and
can
easilyfind
out
who
is
implicated
in
it
;
and
have
only
to
give

and
your

must
follow
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
sir
,
"
replied
Firebras
,
calmly,--"Well
,
<EOS>
sir?""But
<EOS>
I
have
no
such
intention

"
pursued
the
valet
;
"
your
secret

safewith

provided--""You
are
paid
for
your
silence

<EOS>
ha?""Precisely
,
Mr.
Firebras
.
<EOS>
I
am
not
a
Jacobite

neither
am
I
anHanoverian

and
I
care
as
little
for

Elector

as
I
do
for

<EOS>
The
fact
is
,
your

in

Mr.

I
shallmake
the
most
of
my

<EOS>
Buy
me
,
and
I
shall
deal
with
you
fairly!""Hum
!
"
<EOS>
said
Firebras
,
looking
fixedly
at
him
;
"
well
,
I
will
employ
you
,
and
will
also
make
it
worth
your
while
to
be
true
to
me
.
<EOS>
Randulph
Crewhas
of
course
lost
this
letter
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
inquire
how
it
came
into
yourhands
.
<EOS>
But
he
can
not
be
aware
that
it
has
reached
me
.
<EOS>
My
correspondentsays
<EOS>
he
is
about
to
visit
his
uncle
,
Mr.
Abel
Beechcroft
,
and
cautionsme
against
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
with
reason
,
sir
,
"
remarked
Cripps
;
"
I
,
also
,
advise
you
to
bewareof
him
.
<EOS>
My
uncle
is
Mr.
Beechcroft
's
butler
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
from
your
connexion
,
you
may
materially
aid
me
in
my
designs
uponthis
young
man
,
"
said
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
take
a
letter
from
me
to
him
.
<EOS>
""With
pleasure
,
"
replied
Cripps
;
"
and
it
fortunately
happens
that
he
isto
breakfast
with
my
master
to
-
morrow
morning
,
when
I
can
easily
deliverit
.
<EOS>
""Good
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Firebras
,
"
I
will
prepare
it
at
once
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
sat
down
to
a
side
table
,
on
which
writing
tables
wereplaced
,
and
with
much
deliberation
,
penned
a
despatch
,
and
sealed
it
.
<EOS>
Hethen
opened
a
secret
drawer
,
and
took
out
five
guineas
,
which
he
gave
tothe
valet
.
<EOS>
"It
is
perhaps
a
needless
piece
of
trouble
to
seal
the
letter
;
"
heobserved
significantly
;
"
but
you
will
learn
nothing
by
opening
it
,
beyond
the
fact
that
I
desire
an
interview
with
Mr.
Crew
.
<EOS>
I
know
I
cantrust
you
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
;
you
may
trust
to
my
honor
,
Mr.
Firebras
,
'
pon
rep
,
"
said
Cripps
,
placing
his
hand
upon
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"I
trust
to
the
value
you
place
on
your
own
safety
,
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
repliedFirebras
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"
Attempt
to
play
me
false
,
and
nothing
shallsave
you
from
my
vengeance
.
<EOS>
I
have
agents
that
you
know
not
of
,
who
willfind
sure
means
of
reaching
you
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
words
were
pronounced
in
a
tone
,
and
with
a
look
that
impressedMr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
with
a
full
sense
of
the
speaker
's
power
of
executing
histhreat
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
be
under
no
apprehension
about
me
,
Mr.
Firebras
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
am
under
none
,
fellow
,
"
replied
the
other
,
laughing
bitterly
;
"
or
youshould
never
quit
this
room
alive
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
tomorrow
night
at
ten
.
<EOS>
Imay
have
more
work
for
you
.
<EOS>
""Willingly
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
Firebras
then
unlocked
the
door
,
and
let
out
the
valet
,
who
was
usheredto
his
chair
by
the
elderly
female
.
<EOS>
As
he
took
his
place
within
it
,
having
first
ordered
the
bearers
to
convey
him
to
the
spot
where
theytook
him
up
,
he
muttered
to
himself
"
<EOS>
So
the
adventure
has
terminatedvery
satisfactorily
.
<EOS>
This
Randulph
Crew
seems
destined
to
make
myfortune
.
<EOS>
Everybody
pays
me
to
play
the
spy
upon
him
.
<EOS>
That
CordwellFirebras
is
an
awkward
customer
.
<EOS>
He
has
got
an
eye
that
looks
throughone
,
and
seems
to
penetrate
one
's
very
soul
.
<EOS>
It
wo
n't
do
to
play
crosswith
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
trump
up
some
story
to
delude
the
barber
.
<EOS>
I
'll
tellhim
that
nothing
is
to
be
made
of
it
--
put
him
off
in
some
way
.
<EOS>
"Thus
musing
,
he
was
conveyed
to
the
entrance
of
the
Little
Sanctuary
,
where
he
alighted
,
discharged
the
chair
,
and
bent
his
steps
towardsPeter
Pokerich
's
shop
,
with
the
full
determination
of
putting
his
designinto
execution

CHAPTER
IX.--THE
<EOS>
STRANGER
AT
<EOS>
THE
BARBERS.Notwithstanding
his
engagement
to
Beau
Villiers
,
Randulph
,
accustomed
toearly
hours
,
and
blessed
,
moreover
,
with
a
very
healthy
appetite
,
neededno
urging
on
the
part
of
Mr.
Jukes
to
sit
down
at
eight
o'clock
,
on
thesecond
morning
after
his
arrival
in
town
,
to
a
sort
of
preliminarybreakfast
with
Uncle
Abel
.
<EOS>
Glad
of
the
excuse
for
a
little
extraindulgence
in
repose
,
Trussell
did
not
rise
till
late
,
and
Randulph
wastherefore
left
to
a
tete
-
a
-
tete
with
his
elder
uncle
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
wasthat
Abel
was
in
a
better
humour
than
before
,
or
that
he
was
not
frettedby
<EOS>
Trussell
,
whose
remarks
,
however
well
meant
,
generally
seemed
toexcite
all
his
cynical
propensities
<EOS>
,
Randulph
could
not
tell
,
but
hecertainly
found
him
more
agreeable
than
he
had
previously
thought
him
.
<EOS>
Abel
questioned
his
nephew
narrowly
as
to
his
tastes
and
pursuits
,
andseemed
pleased
with
the
answers
he
received
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
things
went
on
soprosperously
that
Mr.
Jukes
,
who
was
carving
a
fine
Westphalia
ham
atthe
well
spread
sideboard
,
suspended
his
operations
to
rub
his
handswith
delight
.
<EOS>
Abel
noticed
his
exhilaration
,
and
guessing
the
cause
,
could
not
refrain
from
smiling
,
and
Randulph
thought
he
had
never
seenso
pleasant
a
smile
before
.
<EOS>
Abel
's
heart
indeed
,
it
was
evident
,
waswarming
towards
his
nephew
;
and
he
made
no
attempt
to
check
the
kindlyfeeling
.
<EOS>
He
descanted
with
much
force
and
truth
,
on
the
dangers
to
whicha
young
man
must
be
exposed
on
his
first
entrance
into
the
world
,
butexhibited
far
less
straightlacedness
than
might
have
been
expected
.
<EOS>
Headvised
his
nephew
to
mix
with
society
,
but
not
to
become
a
part
of
it;to
use
,
but
not
abuse
,
the
advantages
nature
had
given
him
;
and
to
pushhis
fortune
to
the
utmost
;
displaying
throughout
the
whole
discourse
,
ashrewdness
of
observation
,
a
nice
perception
of
character
,
and
aknowledge
of
the
world
,
for
which
Randulph
had
not
given
him
credit
,
andwhich
raised
him
materially
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
On
one
point
only
,
the
youngman
thought
him
guilty
of
injustice
--
namely
,
in
the
bitter
anddisparaging
view
he
took
of
women
.
<EOS>
On
this
head
,
therefore
,
he
venturedto
differ
with
him
,
and
his
zeal
and
earnestness
appeared
to
interestAbel
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
the
old
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
andcontented
himself
with
saying
,
"
You
'll
think
differently
,
one
day
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
would
have
replied
,
but
a
plate
of
ham
from
Mr.
Jukes
,
accompanied
by
a
significant
look
from
the
discreet
butler
,
warned
himnot
to
pursue
the
subject
further
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
was
silent
,
and
Abelreturned
to
his
exposition
and
dissection
of
society
with
the
sameearnestness
as
before
.
<EOS>
About
half
-
past
ten
,
Trussell
made
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
withunusual
care
;
had
a
world
of
the
finest
lace
at
his
wrists
,
and
on
hisbreast
;
and
wore
a
green
velvet
coat
,
richly
embroidered
,
a
satinwaistcoat
of
the
same
colour
,
woven
with
gold
,
and
diamond
buckles
athis
knees
.
<EOS>
The
only
part
of
his
attire
which
appeared
to
be
neglectedwas
his
peruke
,
and
this
did
not
escape
Abel
's
attention
,
as
he
scannedhim
contemptuously
from
head
to
foot
.
<EOS>
"It
's
all
very
well
,
"
he
said
,
drily
;
"
you
are
sufficiently
be
-
laced
andbe
-
scented
to
fit
you
for
the
beau
's
society
,
but
your
wig
is
out
oforder
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
you
do
n't
surely
think
I
am
going
in
this
old
peruke
,
sir?"rejoined
Trussell
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
I
'm
not
quite
so
careless
.
<EOS>
I'vesent
my
best
perriwig
to
be
dressed
by
Peter
Pokerich
,
the
barber
in
theLittle
Sanctuary
,
and
shall
put
it
on
as
we
pass
on
our
way
to
SpringGardens
,
where
,
as
you
know
,
Mr.
Villiers
resides
.
<EOS>
""A
barber
in
the
Little
Sanctuary
,
"
cried
Randulph
;
"
why
he
must
be
thevery
person
I
met
<EOS>
when--"Here
a
stern
look
from
Uncle
Abel
stopped
him
,
and
called
the
colour
tohis
cheeks
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
did
you
send
it
there
?
"
<EOS>
remarked
Abel
,
angrily
,
to
his
brother
.
<EOS>
"Was
<EOS>
there
no
other
barber
nearer
at
hand?""Oh
<EOS>
yes
,
sir
,
plenty
,
"
replied
Trussell
;
"
but
Pokerich
understands
themode
,
and
I
desired
to
appear
to
advantage
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
wish
Icould
induce
you
to
adopt
the
present
fashion
,
Randulph
.
<EOS>
Your
own
hairis
certainly
very
fine
,
but
a
perriwig
would
be
far
more
becoming
.
<EOS>
""Be
natural
as
long
as
you
can
,
and
keep
your
own
hair
,
Randulph
,
"
saidAbel
.
<EOS>
"I
intend
to
do
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
at
all
events
your
dress
must
be
improved
,
"
pursued
Trussell
.
"
<EOS>
Iwill
introduce
you
to
M.
Desmartins
,
the
French
tailor
in
Piccadilly
.
<EOS>
Hewill
make
you
quite
another
thing
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
empty
your
purse
at
the
same
time
,
"
sneered
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
Wear
out
thedress
you
have
on
.
<EOS>
It
's
almost
new
.
<EOS>
""It
is
quite
new
,
"
said
Randulph
,
a
little
abashed
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
madeexpressly
for
my
visit
to
town
,
by
Stracey
,
of
Chester
,
who
works
forall
the
best
people
in
the
county
.
<EOS>
""Stracey
of
Chester
<EOS>
--
ha
!
ha
!
"
exclaimed
uncle
Trussell
,
jeeringly
.
"
<EOS>
Youhad
better
put
by
Mr.
Stracey
for
your
return
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
time
westarted
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
to
stop
a
few
minutes
at
Pokerich's
.
<EOS>
"They
then
set
forth
,
and
it
was
with
a
throbbing
heart
that
the
youngman
again
found
himself
beside
the
dwelling
of
the
miser
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Hegazed
eagerly
at
it
,
in
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
her
he
loved
,
but
could
discern
nothing
through
the
barred
and
dust
-
begrimed
windows
.
<EOS>
"May
<EOS>
I
ask
what
is
the
cause
of
uncle
Abel
's
aversion
to
Mr.
Scarve
?
"
<EOS>
heenquired
of
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
would
rather
not
be
questioned
on
that
subject
,
"
replied
the
other,"because
<EOS>
I
am
quite
sure
,
if
I
told
you
,
that
Abel
would
discover
fromyour
manner
,
that
I
had
disclosed
his
secret
.
<EOS>
By
the
by
,
"
he
added
,
"
isHilda
Scarve
really
<EOS>
a
fine
girl?"Randulph
returned
a
rapturous
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"Egad
,
then
,
"
pursued
Trussell
,
as
if
debating
some
matter
with
himself,"I
do
n't
know
whether
one
speculation
would
not
be
as
good
as
t'other
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
,
uncle
,
"
enquired
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
that
a
marriage
with
Hilda
Scarve
would
answer
as
well
as

"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
miser
must
be
immenselyrich
--
immensely
.
<EOS>
I
'll
call
on
him
one
of
these
days
,
and
sound
him
onthe
subject
of
the
union
.
<EOS>
""Recollect
<EOS>
your
brother
's
injunction
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
,
who
was
,
however
,
so
enchanted
by
the
proposition
,
that
he
could
have
flung
hisarms
round
his
uncle
's
neck
,
and
hugged
him,--"it
may
be
hazardous
.
<EOS>
""Tut
<EOS>
--
tut
,
"
exclaimed
Trussell
<EOS>
,
"
he
'll
never
hear
of
it
.
<EOS>
They
have
nosort
of
communication
.
<EOS>
Abel
hates
him
like
the
devil
--
as
well
he
may
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
not
say
more
.
<EOS>
And
here
we
are
at
Pokerich's
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
entered
Peter
's
shop
.
<EOS>
The
little
barber
was
engaged
at
themoment
in
shaving
a
customer
,
and
called
to
his
apprentice
to
set
chairsfor
the
new
comers
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
at
first
notice
<EOS>
Randulph
,
who
was
behindhis
uncle
;
but
when
the
young
man
came
full
into
view
,
his
hand
trembledso
much
that
the
razor
slipped
,
inflicting
a
slight
wound
on
the
chin
ofthe
gentleman
he
was
shaving
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
a
care
,
fellow
,
"
cried
this
person
angrily
;
"
you
have
cut
me
.
<EOS>
""Ten
thousand
pardons
,
sir
,
"
apologised
Peter
,
"
it
is
not
much
,
sir
--
amere
trifle
--
<EOS>
a
little
sticking
plaster
will
set
all
to
rights
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
very
dexterously
wiped
off
the
lather
,
and
bathing
thegentleman
's
cheek
with
warm
water
,
speedily
succeeded
in
stanching
theblood
.
<EOS>
He
then
finished
shaving
him
,
and
taking
a
light
flaxen
wig
froma
block
hard
by
,
fitted
it
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
the
gentleman
arose
,
walked
towards
a
glass
to
ascertain
the
extent
of
the
injury
he
hadreceived
,
and
finding
it
very
trifling
,
laughed
good
humouredly
.
<EOS>
He
wasa
middle
-
sized
man
,
remarkably
squarely
and
powerfully
built
;
and
as
thebarber
assisted
him
to
put
on
his
coat
,
and
fasten
on
his
sword
,
Randulph
could
not
help
noticing
his
great
apparent
strength
of
frame
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
not
a
very
steady
hand
,
friend
,
"
<EOS>
remarked
the
stranger
,
as
hetook
out
his
purse
to
pay
the
barber
.
<EOS>
"I
never
made
such
a
mistake
before
,
sir
,
"
replied
Peter
;
"
never
,
on
myhonour
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
was
this
young
gentleman
who
startled
you
,
"
repliedthe
other
,
laughing
,
"
for
the
accident
<EOS>
occurred
just
as
he
entered
yourshop
.
<EOS>
""Why
,
really
,
I
was
rather
surprised
to
see
him
,
I
must
own
,
"
returnedPeter
;
"
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
your
most
obedient
.
<EOS>
""What
!
"
cried
the
stranger
,
with
a
look
of
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Is
this
Mr
.
<EOS>
Randulph
Crew?"It
was
now
Randulph
's
turn
to
appear
surprised
.
<EOS>
"You
will
wonder
at
my
exclamation
,
sir
,
"
pursued
the
stranger
,
advancing
towards
him
,
"
but
I
knew
a
gentleman
of
your
name
,
which
isnot
a
very
common
one
,
in
Cheshire
,
years
ago
--
knew
him
intimately
.
<EOS>
""Probably
my
father
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"He
is
well
,
I
hope
?
"
asked
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
<EOS>
sir
,
I
lost
him
a
year
ago
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
Here
the
conversation
dropped
,
for
the
stranger
seemed
a
littleembarrassed
,
as
if
he
had
something
to
say
,
and
yet
did
not
know
how
toset
about
it
.
<EOS>
He
glanced
at
Trussell
,
who
had
taken
his
seat
,
and
wassubmitting
his
bald
pate
to
Peter
,
while
the
latter
was
adjusting
uponit
,
with
the
utmost
care
,
a
very
well
-
powdered
peruke
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
that
a
relative
of
your
's
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
stranger
of
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
uncle
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
young
man
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
And
he
again
hesitated
.
<EOS>
"A
very
singular
person
,
"
thought
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"There
,
"
cried
Trussell
,
rising
and
looking
at
himself
in
the
glass;"that'll
do
--
capital
--
capital!""Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
lives
over
the
way
,
barber

I
believe
?
"
said
the
stranger
toPeter
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
does
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
latter
.
<EOS>
"
That
's
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
very
strangeaffair
occurred
there
yesterday
-
evening
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
might
that
be
!
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
barber
,
"
about
five
o'clock
the
whole
street
wasalarmed
by
the
arrival
of
a
troop
of
fourteen
horsemen
,
each
with
athousand
pounds
in
a
couple
of
bags
at
his
saddle
-
bow
.
<EOS>
Well
,
sir
,
thesehorsemen
stopped
at
the
miser
's
door
,
and
threw
down
their
bags
beforeit
;
and
it
turned
out
to
be
the
payment
of
the
sum
of
fourteen
thousandpounds
borrowed
from
old
Starve
--
beg
pardon
,
Scarve
--
on
mortgage
,
by
SirBulkeley
Price
,
and
which
the
latter
was
obliged
to
pay
at
a
certaintime
,
or
his
estate
would
have
been
foreclosed
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
near
run
forSir
Bulkeley
.
<EOS>
He
only
just
saved
his
distance
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
should
have
seenhow
the
old
miser
raved
and
swore
when
be
found
himself
robbed
of
hisprey
.
<EOS>
But
for
his
daughter
's
interference
,
he
would
certainly
have
laidviolent
hands
on
the
knight
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!"Randulph
,
whose
breast
was
agitated
with
conflicting
feelings
,
was
aboutto
question
the
barber
further
as
to
Hilda
's
conduct
on
the
occasion
,
when
he
was
checked
by
the
stranger
,
who
,
turning
hastily
to
Peter
,
said
,
"
This
is
an
unheard
-
of
mode
of
paying
mortgage
money,--and
solarge
a
sum
too
.
<EOS>
Are
you
sure
it
was
as
much
as
fourteen
thousandpounds?""As
that
I
have
a
comb
in
my
hand
,
"
replied
the
barber
.
"
<EOS>
And
it
was
paidin
gold
too
.
<EOS>
I
heard
the
chink
of
the
metal
myself
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
SirBulkeley
called
upon
me
,
together
with
the
other
spectators
,
to
witnessthe
payment
.
<EOS>
""You
surprise
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
stranger--"I
must
have
a
word
with
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
on
the
subject.--Good
morning
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
wemay
possibly
meet
again
.
"
<EOS>
And
raising
his
hat
,
he
walked
across
thestreet
,
and
knocked
at
the
miser
's
door
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
that
strange
person
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Trussell
of
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Haven't
<EOS>
the
least
idea
,
sir
.
"
replied
the
barber
.
"
<EOS>
He
came
in
here
tobe
shaved
;
that
's
all
I
know
of
him
.
<EOS>
Never
ask

names

<EOS>
"Randulph
,
meanwhile
,
ran
to
the
door
to
see
how
the
stranger
would
bereceived
,
and
was
somewhat
chagrined
to
find
that
Jacob
,
afterreconnoitring
him
according
to
custom
,
and
detaining
him
while
heconsulted
his
master
,
admitted
him

<EOS>
"He
will
see
Hilda

"
sighed
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"Come
,

come
,
"
<EOS>
cried
Trussell
,
impatiently
,
<EOS>
"
We
shall
be
late
.
<EOS>
"Sorely
<EOS>
against
his
will
,
Randulph
suffered
himself
to
be
dragged
away

they
proceeded
along

and
had
a
smallgarden
attached
to
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
by
no
means
a
large
house
,
but
exquisitelyfurnished
;
the
whole
of
the
internal
decorations
being
French
,
and
inthe
gorgeous
taste
of
Louis
the
Fourteenth

<EOS>
The
visitors
were
admittedby

A
page
,
in
a
fanciful
costume
,
who
might
haveplayed
a
part
in
one
of
Watteau
's
pictures
,
met
them
at
the
foot
of
thestairs
,
and
mounting
before
them
,
ushered
them
along
a
corridor
,
to
theentrance
of
a
chamber
,
before
which
stood
two

wearing

with

<EOS>
One

threw

and
the
two
visitors
entered
a
waiting

room
,
in
which
a
numberof
persons
were
assembled
.
<EOS>
Most
of
these
were
known
to
Trussell
,
and
hevery
courteously
returned
their
salutations
.
<EOS>
"Ah

"
he
said
,
to
a
little
bowing
and
cringing
personage
,
veryill

dressed
(
as
tailors
are
apt

be
)
,
<EOS>
from
whose

depended

while
he
carried
a

under

,
"

<EOS>
This

I

Choice

reclined
,
in
the

,
Beau
Villiers
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
rise
on
the
appearance
of
his
guests;but
moving
slightly
,
and
graciously
,
to
them
,
though
with
somewhat
,
Randulph
fancied
,
of
a
patronizing
air
,
motioned
Mr.
Cripps
to
set
themchairs
.
<EOS>
He
was
quite
in
dishabille
;
his
graceful
figure
being
envelopedin

loose

the
richest

Hisshirt

<EOS>
Pink

completed
hiscostume

<EOS>
There
were
two
other
persons
present
;
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
anda
very
portly
gentleman
with
puffed
-
out
,
inflamed
cheeks
,
who
wasintroduced
as
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
and
whom
Randulph
concluded
must
bethe
hero
of
the
story
he
had
just
heard
related
by
the
barber
--
acircumstance
which
gave
him
a
peculiar
interest
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr
.
Cripps
,
who
,
together
with
the
page
,
officiated
at
breakfast
,
proceeded
to
do
the
honors
,
and
twirling
the
mill
of
a
richly
chasedsilver
chocolate
-
pot
,
poured
out
two
well
-
frothed
cups
of
the
unctuousbeverage
,
and
handed
them
to
the
new
comers
.
<EOS>
A
small
modicum
of
a
Strasbourg
pate
,
washed
down
by
a
cup
of
green
teaand
a
glass
of
claret
,
constituted
the
beau
's
breakfast
.
<EOS>
Sir
SingletonSpinke
took
chocolate
,
picked
the
wing
of
a
chicken
,
and
wound
himselfup
with
a
glass
of
usquebaugh
.
<EOS>
Ample
justice
was
done
to
the
cutlets
,
the
broils
,
and
various
other
dishes
with
which
the
covers
were
filled
,
by
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
;
nor
did
Trussell
or
Randulph
come
far
behind
him
,
notwithstanding
the
preliminary
breakfast
of
the
latter
.
<EOS>
Just
before
theintroduction
of
the
usquebaugh
,
Sir
Bulkeley
,
after
looking
round
andcoughing
significantly
,
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
the
chief
valet
,
"
Isuppose
,
Mr.
Cripps
,
there
is
no
ale
in
the
house?""No
what
!
<EOS>
Sir
Bulkeley
?
"
rejoined
Mr.
Cripps
,
staring
as
if
he
could
notpossibly
imagine
he
had
heard
aright
.
<EOS>
"Ale
,
rascal
--
ale
!
"
replied
the
knight
,
emphatically
,
and
ratherangrily
.
<EOS>
"No
,
Sir
Bulkeley
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
,
bowing
;
"
there
is
no
ale
,
butthere
is
toasted
cheese
,
if
that
will
serve
your
turn
.
<EOS>
"Angry
<EOS>
as
he
was
,
the
knight
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
valet'simpertinence
;
and
a
glass
of
usquebaugh
,
in
which
he
pledged
the
oldbeau
,
entirely
appeased
him
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
during
the
meal
was
livelyenough
,
and
was
chiefly
maintained
by
the
beau
and
Trussell
,
theirdiscourse
running
on
all
sorts
of
fashionable
topics
,
scandal
,
women
,
play
,
public
amusements
;
in
which
,
as
he
knew
so
little
about
thematters
discussed
,
Randulph
took
no
great
interest
.
<EOS>
His
attention
,
however
,
was
instantly
aroused
,
when
Trussell
,
turning
laughingly
to
SirBulkeley
,
told
him
he
had
heard
of
his
"
new
way
of
paying
old
debts
.
<EOS>
""I
mentioned
the
matter
to
Villiers
before
your
arrival
,
"
returned
SirBulkeley
;
"
and
it
diverted
him
as
much
as
it
appears
to
do
you
.
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
wehad
to
ride
hard
though
.
<EOS>
Several
of
my
tradesmen
met
me
at
Highgate
,
andoffered
to
escort
me
through
the
town
,
but
I
declined
the
attention
,
being
of
opinion
that
we
were
a
sufficiently
large
party
without
them
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
how
the
folks
stared
as
we
rode
along
the
streets
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
wonder
at
it
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
laughing
;
"
I
am
almostsurprised
the
train
-
bands
were
not
sent
after
you
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
cream
of
the
adventure
was
its
close
,
"
pursued
the
knight
.
"
<EOS>
Neverwas
fury
equal
to
that
displayed
by
the
miser
at
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
Ideclare
<EOS>
I
almost
pitied
him
.
<EOS>
His
daughter
is
a
charming
girl
--
beautifulas
an
angel
,
and
rich
--
nay
,
i'faith
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
richshe
must
be
.
<EOS>
Villiers
you
ought
to
take
her
off
her
father
's
hands
.
<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
think
of
it
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
beau
,
carelessly
,
"
for
I
am
desperatelyin
want
of
money
.
<EOS>
Like
yourself
,
I
have
had
some
dealings
with
oldScarve
,
and
know
him
to
be
as
great
an
extortioner
as
Shylock
or
SirGiles
Overreach
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
,
however
,
I
could
marry
his
daughter
<EOS>
,
ifshe
had
the
wealth
of
the
Indies
.
<EOS>
""You
have
never
seen
her
,
or
you
would
alter
your
opinion
,
"
replied
SirBulkeley
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
the
most
beautiful
creature
I
have
beheld
for
thismany
a
day
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
pique
my
curiosity
,
"
replied
the
beau
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
see
this
paragon
ofperfection
.
<EOS>
Apropos
of
beauty
,
"
he
added
to
Randulph
,
who
could
scarcelyhide
his
uneasiness
,
"
do
n't
you
think
Clementina
Brabazon
a
fine
girl
,
Mr
.
<EOS>
Crew?""Remarkably
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
the
young
man
distractedly
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
is
nothing
to
what
her
mother
was
,
"
observed
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"
Twentyyears
ago
,
Lady
Brabazon
,
then
Miss
Norcote
was
,
with
one
exception
,
theloveliest
creature
in
existence
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
who
might
be
the
exception
?
<EOS>
"
enquired
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
glad
you
have
asked
me
,
"
replied
Sir
Singleton
;
"
because
it
is
agratification
to
me
to
tell
you
that
it
was
your
sister
Sophia
--
themother
of
this
young
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Delicious
creature
that
she
was
!
<EOS>
Shequite
won
my
heart
,
Mr.
Crew
;
and
if
she
had
not
been
insensible
to
mysuit
,
I
might
have
had
the
honor
of
being
your
father
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
supposition
is
highly
flattering
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"It
makes
one
melancholy
to
think
of
the
beauties
of
by
-
gone
days,"continued
<EOS>
the
old
beau
,
sentimentally
consoling
himself
at
the
same
timewith
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
"
Not
having
seen
the
miser
's
daughter
,
I
cannotspeak
to
her
attractions
;
but
Sir
Bulkeley
is
a
good
judge
,
and
hisopinion
may
be
relied
on
.
<EOS>
To
my
taste
,
the
prettiest
woman
of
the
day
isKitty
Conway
,
the
actress
at
the
little
theatre
in
the
Haymarket
.
<EOS>
""What
,
the
fair
Orinda
,
as
she
is
called
,
from
the
part
she
played
inthe
opera
?
"
remarked
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
certainly
a
vastly
prettycreature
.
<EOS>
But
you
need
scarcely
sigh
in
vain
there
,
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
thus
they
rattled
on
,
till
the
beau
,
rising
,
said
,
"
Mr.
Cripps
,
tellAntoine
<EOS>
I
shall
now
make
my
toilette

<EOS>
How
shall
we
spend

<EOS>
At

Cockpit
,
the
Groom
Porter

,
the
Cocoa

,
orWhite's?""If
you
desire
something
new
,
sir

"
observed
Mr.
Cripps
,
who
lingeredfor
a
moment
,
"
there
is
a
grand
musical
entertainment
this
morning
atthe
Folly
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
I
think
you
would
be
much
diverted
by
goingthither
,
'
pon
rep!""A
good
suggestion
!
"
cried
the
Beau
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
often
rowed
past
the
Folly
,
but
have
never
been
inside
it
.
<EOS>
""Then
do
n't
neglect
the
present
opportunity
of
seeing
it
,
"
said
SirSingleton
.
<EOS>
"
It
used
to
be
a
pleasant
place
,
when
we
were
young
fellows
,
Trussell
.
<EOS>
Many
a
fine
woman
we
have
seen
there
,
eh?""Many
a
one
,
many
,
Sir
Singleton
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
and
made
love
tothem
too
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
glad
to
see
the
place
again
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
Folly
be
it
,
then
,
"
cried
the
beau
;
"
and
some
folks
would
say
itwas
a
proper
place
for
us
.
<EOS>
Excuse
me
for
a
few
moments
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Iwill
dress
as
rapidly
as
possible
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
retired
behind
thescreen
,
which
was
drawn
still
further
across
the
room
.
<EOS>
Not
feeling
muchinterest
in
the
conversation
which
ensued
after
the
beau
's
withdrawal
,
Randulph
arose
to
look
at
some
exquisite
miniatures
and
other
articlesof
virtu
scattered
about
the
room
,
and
was
engaged
in
examining
amagnificent
snuff
-
box
,
when
Mr.
Cripps
,
who
had
returned
from
attendinghis
master
,
came
up
to
him
,
and
said
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
I
am
charged
witha
letter
for
you
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Here
it
is
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
was
prevented
from
making
any
remark
by
the
significant
looksof
the
valet
,
who
,
giving
him
to
understand
,
by
sundry
winks
and
slightgestures
,
that
his
uncle
was
to
know
nothing
of
the
matter
,
glided
away
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
the
group
at
the
table
,
the
young
man
perceived
thatTrussell
's
back
was
towards
him
,
and
that
he
was
,
moreover
,
occupied
inrecounting
some
jest
to
the
others
;
he
therefore
moved
nearer
thewindow
,
broke
the
seal
of
the
note
,
and
read
as
follows:--"YOUNG
MAN.--The
letter
committed

andwhich
was
of
the
last
importance

fortunately
reached
its
destination

<EOS>
Otherwise
,
theconsequences
might
have
been
serious
.
<EOS>
It
is
necessary
I
should
have
aninterview
with
you
,
and
that
without

<EOS>
I

shall

<EOS>
Not

CORDWELL

"
exclaimed
Randulph
,
to
himself
.
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
now
Iremember
,
it
was
the
name
of
the
person
to
whom
the
missing
letter
wasaddressed
.
<EOS>
The
whole
affair
is
most
mysterious
;
and
the
language
of
thisnote
strange
,
and
even
alarming
.
<EOS>
I
'll
question
Mr.
Cripps
about
it
.
<EOS>
Buthold
!
<EOS>
I
am
desired
not
to
mention
the
matter
to
my
uncles
,
or
to
anyone
.
<EOS>
Why
should
I
observe
the
caution
?
<EOS>
And
yet
prudence
tells
me
I
hadbetter
do
so
.
<EOS>
The
note
is
dated
yesterday
.
<EOS>
A
few
hours
,
therefore
,
willsolve
the
riddle
.
<EOS>
I
will
keep
the
appointment
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
uttered
the
last
words
,
almost
unconsciously
aloud
,
and
with
someemphasis
,
he
was
startled
by
hearing
a
loud
laugh
behind
him
,
and
,
turning
at
the
sound
,
perceived
Trussell
's
round
face
peeping
over
hisshoulder
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
crushed
the
letter
between
his
fingers
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
you
had
better
let
me
see
it
,
"
laughed
Trussell
;
"
I
overheard
yourexclamation

<EOS>
What
fair
dame
has
fallen
in
love
with
you

eh

<EOS>
Not

<EOS>
And
yet
she
is
almost
the
only

<EOS>
But
I
wo
n't
ask
impertinent
questions
,
or
make
impertinentremarks

<EOS>
I
see
they
annoy
you

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Ha

<EOS>
cried
Randulph
,
hastily
;
"

he
checked
himself
.
<EOS>
"Poh

interrupted
Trussell

he
added

with
a
look
of
some
perplexity

"
what
Mercurybrought

interposed
Mr.

having
observed

flew
to

rejoined
Trussell

laughing
louder
than

"
Myselfover
again

was
about
to
contradict
the
valet

assertion

set
hisuncle
right
,
as
far
as
he
was
able
,
but
at
this
moment
the
screen
wasdrawn
aside
,
and
discovered
the
beau
fully
dressed

He
was

On
seeing
his

Mr

Cripps
hastened
to
fetch
his
feathered
hat

thepage
brought
him

<EOS>
Antoine

the

then
advanced
with
his

which
was

edged
with

on

he
poured
a

"And

bowed

opened
the
door
of
the
anti
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
paused
for
a
moment
,
to
exchange
a
few
words
with
theassemblage,--applauding
the
jockey
for
his
success
--
announcing
to
theperfumer
that
he
had
just
tried
his
scent
,
and
would
accord
himpermission
to
put
his
name
to
it
--
commanding
a
court
suit
from
thetailor
--
and
nodding
to
Ned
Oglethorpe
,
Captain
Culpepper
,
and
thefencing
master
.
<EOS>
He
then
passed
forth
with
his
friends
.
<EOS>
The
party
first
took
a
turn
on
the
Mall
.
<EOS>
The
morning
being
extremelyfine
,
the
walks
were
filled
with
a
gay
throng
,
as
on
the
preceding
day
.
<EOS>
Wherever
they
went
,
Beau
Villiers
drew
all
eyes
upon
him
,
and
toRandulph
's
amusement
,
and
Trussell
's
delight
,
they
were
followed
by
acrowd
of
curious
gazers
.
<EOS>
Among
those
Randulph
noticed
the
stranger
whomhe
had
met
at
the
barber
's
shop
;
but
the
latter
did
not
seem
to
courthis
observation
,
and
he
soon
afterwauls
lost
sight
of
him
.
<EOS>
Having
sauntered
as
far
as
Buckingham
House
,
the
party
returned
theirsteps
,
and
quitting
the
park
,
repaired
to
the
Cockpit
at
Whitehall
.
<EOS>
HereSir
Bulkeley
Price
quitted
them
,
having
first
engaged
Randulph
,
and
hisuncle
to
dine
with
him
at
his
house
in
St.
James
's
Square
on
thefollowing
day
.
<EOS>
A
quarter
of
an
hour
was
next
whiled
away
at
the
Cockpit
,
after
which
they
proceeded
to
the
Groom
-
porter
's
,
whose
rooms
closelyadjoined
it
,
where
even
at
that
hour
they
found
high
play
going
forward
.
<EOS>
Beau
Villiers
,
who
was
a
desperate
gamester
,
and
seldom
liked
to
miss
anopportunity
,
approached
the
table
where
they
were
playing
hazard
,
and
ina
short
space
of
time
came
off
the
winner
of
a
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
Elatedwith
his
success
,
and
in
high
good
humour
,
he
left
the
rooms
,
andrepaired
with
his
companions
to
Whitehall
Stairs
,
where
Mr.
Crippscalled
a
boat
,
in
which
they
all
embarked
for
the
Folly
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
detected
the
stranger
among
the
crowd
of
lookers
-
on
at
theGroom
-
porter
's
,
and
their
boat
had
not
got
many
yards
from
shore
<EOS>
,
whenhe
observed
him
descend
the
stairs
,
and
get
into
another
wherry
,
withthe
intention
,
as
it
appeared
from
his
gestures
,
of
following
them

CHAPTER
XI.--THE
MISER
'S
CONSULTATION
WITH
HIS
ATTORNEY
--
<EOS>
JACOB
ALARMED
BY
HISMASTER
'S
APPEARANCE
AT
NIGHT
--
THE
VISIT
OF
CORDWELL
FIREBRAS.By
<EOS>
the
combined
attention
of
his
daughter
and
sister
-
in
-
law
,
the
miser
,
after
a
little
while
,
was
restored
to
sensibility
and
placed
in
hischair
,
where
the
very
glass
of
wine
he
had
destined
for
Jacob
beingadministered
to
him
,
mixed
with
hot
water
,
completed
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
Stillhe
was
very
weak
;
his
gaze
wandered
from
the
heap
of
treasure
on
thefloor
to
the
mortgage
deed
on
the
table
,
and
unable
to
hear
the
sight
ofthe
latter
,
he
ordered
Jacob
to
place
the
little
strong
box
in
which
heusually
kept
his
papers
on
the
table
,
and
unlocking
it
with
a
tremblinghand
,
deposited
the
deed
within
it
.
<EOS>
This
seemed
to
be
a
great
relief
tohim
,
for
he
presently
became
more
composed
,
and
rising
,
with
hisdaughter
's
assistance
,
stepped
towards
the
pile
of
moneybags
,
and
tried
,
but
ineffectually
,
to
lift
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
attempt
it
,
father
,
"
said
Hilda
,
"
You
had
better
let
Jacob
carrythis
money
into
your
own
room
;
and
let
me
also
recommend
you
to
retireto
rest
.
<EOS>
""No
,
no
,
"
replied
the
miser
;
<EOS>
"
I
shall
not
sleep
till
I
have
counted
thegold
in
each
of
those
sacks
;
and
if
I
find
any
deficiency
,
let
SirBulkeley
Price
look
to
it
.
<EOS>
Take
them
up
stairs
,
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
injunction
was
promptly
obeyed
,
and
Jacob
had
just
completed
histask
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
.
"Who
<EOS>
can
it
be
?
"
cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
now
I
recollect
,
it
must
be
myattorney
,
Mr.
Diggs
.
<EOS>
He
was
to
call
about
the
foreclosure
.
<EOS>
Curses
on
it!instead
of
being
present
at
my
triumph
,
he
will
witness
mymortification
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
if
it
should
be
Mr.
Diggs
,
you
may
admit
him
,
butno
one
else
.
<EOS>
Hilda
,
and
sister
Clinton
,
you
had
better
retire
to
yourown
room
.
<EOS>
I
have
business
to
transact
.
<EOS>
You
may
as
well
say
good
night
,
for
I
shall
go
to
bed
as
soon
as
Mr.
Diggs
leaves
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
looked
anxiously
at
her
father
,
and
kissed
his
brow
.
<EOS>
"Have
you
anything
to
say
,
child
?
<EOS>
"
he
asked
,
touched
by
her
affection
.
<EOS>
"Only
<EOS>
that
I
wish
you
would
not
count
the
money
to
night
,
"
she
replied,"You
need
rest
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
sleep
all
the
sounder
for
having
counted
it
,
"
he
replied,"especially
,
"
he
added
,
with
great
asperity
,
"
if
I
find
there
is
anymistake
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
hope
you
will
be
better
to
-
morrow
,
"
sighed
Hilda
.
<EOS>
And
shewithdrew
with
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
Jacob
ushered
into
the
room
a
respectable
-
looking
,
middle
-
aged
man
,
with
smooth
,
rosy
features
,
somewhat
marred
in
theirexpression
by
what
is
termed
a
cocked
eye
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
no
power
of
visionseemed
to
reside
in
the
orb
thus
unnaturally
fixed
.
<EOS>
This
blemishexcepted
,
Mr.
Diggs
--
for
he
<EOS>
it
was
--
might
be
said
to
have
aprepossessing
countenance
,
except
that
there
were
some
lines
oftreachery
about
the
mouth
,
and
that
the
chin
was
very
cunningly
formed
.
<EOS>
He
was
plainly
but
handsomely
attired
in
a
dark
suit
,
and
had
neitherthe
air
nor
the
manner
of
a
pettifogging
attorney
,
which
indeed
he
wasnot
.
<EOS>
His
voice
was
so
agreeably
modulated
,
that
it
fell
almost
likenotes
of
music
on
the
car
;
and
he
had
a
very
pleasing
and
very
plausibleaddress
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
sir
,
am
I
to
congratulate
you
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
as
he
took
the
chairoffered
him
by
Jacob
"
Do
I
pay
my
respects
to
a
Welsh
squire
?
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!"But
perceiving
from
the
other
's
countenance
that
something
was
wrong
,
hechanged
his
tone
,
and
added
,
"
I
hope
you
are
well
,
sir
.
<EOS>
From
what
I
hadheard
from
your
nephew
,
who
has
just
left
me
,
I
expected
to
find
you
inhigh
spirits
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
made
no
reply
,
but
signed
to
Jacob
to
leave
the
room
,
whichthe
latter
did
very
reluctantly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
mortgage
money
has
been
paid
,
Mr.
Diggs
,
"
said
Mr.
Scarve
coldly
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
but
I
feared
as
much
fromyour
countenance
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
never
mind
it
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
forcing
a
smile
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
adisappointment
,
but
I
can
bear
it
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
you
take
the
matter
so
philosophically
sir
,
"
rejoined
<EOS>
Diggs,"but
<EOS>
I
confess
I
can
not
view
the
loss
with
equal
indifference
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
what
interest
,
except
professionally
,
can
you
feel
in
the
matter,"said
<EOS>
the
miser
coldly
.
<EOS>
"I
take
as
much
interest
in
the
affairs
of
my
clients
as
in
my
own,"rejoined
Diggs
;
"
and
it
so
happens
that
you
are
not
the
only
party
whomay
suffer
by
this
untoward
and
vexatious
occurrence
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
the
only
party
!
"
repeated
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
You
perplex
me
.
<EOS>
""I
will
explain
,
sir
,
"
returned
Diggs
.
"
<EOS>
Your
nephew
,
as
I
told
you
,
hasjust
been
with
me
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
of
his
hopes
of
a
union
with
your
daughter
,
and
of
the
settlement
he
proposed
in
case
of
such
an
event
,
to
make
uponher
;
and
concluded
by
hoping
that
you
would
assign
this
very
estate
inFlintshire
to
her
as
a
marriage
portion
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
have
it
not
,
Diggs
--
I
have
it
not
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
miser
,
pathetically
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
learn
,
"
replied
Diggs
,
"
--but
,
"
and
he
slightlypaused
,
as
if
calculating
how
far
he
could
safely
go--"you
<EOS>
have
themortgage
money
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Diggs
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
fixing
his
keen
grey
eyes
upon
theattorney--"I
told
my
nephew
,
to
-
day
that
I
would
not
give
my
daughter
afarthing
,
and
I
am
not
one
,
as
you
know
,
to
waver
in
my
resolution
.
<EOS>
Whatsettlement
does
Philip
propose
to
make
upon
her?""Nothing
,
sir
,
"
replied
Diggs
,
affecting
to
be
a
little
hurt--"nothing
,
without
a
corresponding
settlement
on
your
part
.
<EOS>
Nor
could
I
honestlyadvise
him
to
do
otherwise
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
the
match
is
at
an
end
,
"
rejoined
Scarve
,
"
and
you
may
tell
himso
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
hope
not
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
you
are
both
good
clients
,
and
,
having
the
interests
of
both
sincerely
at
heart
,
I
should
like
tosee
you
more
closely
united
.
<EOS>
Your
nephew
would
be
a
son
to
you
,
Mr
.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
He
has
a
great
regard
,
as
well
as
profound
respect
,
for
you;and
,
having
precisely
the
same
careful
habits
as
yourself
,
yourproperty
,
will
undergo
no
diminution
,
if
it
should
ever
come
into
hishands
.
<EOS>
I
need
not
remind
you
of
the
large
fortune
he
inherited
from
hisfather
,
whose
will
you
have
seen
;
but
I
may
tell
you
,
because
I
have
nointerdiction
from
him
against
so
doing
,
that
by
the
fortunatedisposition
of
that
money
,
by
loans
and
otherwise
<EOS>
,
he
has
already
addedtwenty
thousand
pounds
to
the
amount
,
and
,
in
a
few
years
,
if
he
isequally
fortunate
,
there
is
no
doubt
he
will
double
it
.
<EOS>
""Philip
<EOS>
is
a
very
clever
young
man
,
unquestionably
,
"
said
the
miser
,
hiseyes
sparkling
with
pleasure
:
"
there
are
few
such
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
may
truly
say
so
,
sir
,
"
replied
Diggs
;
"
and
I
should
hesitate
,
if
Iwere
you
,
before
I
threw
away
the
opportunity
now
offered
of
so
good
amatch
--
one
in
all
respects
so
accordant
with
your
taste
.
<EOS>
You
will
atonce
perceive
my
meaning
,
sir
,
when
I
say
that
you
would
scarcelyrespect
your
nephew
--
certainly
not
give
him
credit
for
the
prudence
<EOS>
hepossesses,--if
he
were
to
accept
your
daughter
without
some
marriageportion
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
that
he
wants
the
money
,
nor
that
he
doubts
yourultimate
intentions
respecting
her
;
but
he
deems
it
right
,
as
a
matterof
propriety
and
fairness
,
that
a
sum
equal
to
his
own
should
he
given
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
amount
does
he
propose
to
settle
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Twenty
thousand
pounds
,
"
replied
Diggs
.
"Hum
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Scarve
;
and
he
continued
for
some
time
wrapped
inthought
,
during
which
Diggs
kept
his
single
eye
fixed
upon
him
.
"
<EOS>
Well,"he
said
,
at
length
,
"
all
things
considered
,
I
am
disposed
to
stretch
apoint
,
and
to
do
more
than
I
intended
.
<EOS>
I
will
behave
handsomely
to
mynephew
,
who
deserves
to
be
so
dealt
with
.
<EOS>
He
shall
settle
thirtythousand
pounds
--
mind
,
thirty
thousand
,
<EOS>
Diggs!--on
my
daughter
;
and
Iwill
give
them
fourteen
thousand
--
<EOS>
the
very
sum
I
have
just
received
fromthat
accursed
Welch
baronet
--
on
the
day
of
the
espousals
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
,
of
course
,
take
upon
me
to
answer
for
Mr.
Frewin
,
sir,"replied
Diggs
,
who
could
scarcely
conceal
his
satisfaction
;
"
but
I
hopeand
trust
he
will
agree
to
the
arrangement
<EOS>
--
indeed
,
I
am
pretty
sure
hewill
do
so
:
he
is
devotedly
attached
to
your
daughter
,
and
I
amconvinced
he
would
make
a
sacrifice
for
her
.
<EOS>
""He
makes
no
sacrifice
,
sir
,
"
cried
Scarve
,
sharply
;
<EOS>
"
none
whatever
.
<EOS>
""I
mean
merely
in
feeling
,
sir
,
"
interrupted
Diggs
,
in
a
deprecatorytone
;
"
but
since
we
have
in
a
measure
agreed
upon
the
matter
--
for
I
willpresume
Mr.
Frewin
's
assent
--
<EOS>
I
may
add
,
it
is
his
earnest
wish
that
themarriage
should
take
place
as
soon
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
myself
am
wishful
it
should
do
so
,
"
replied
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
that
case
,
there
can
be
nothing
to
hinder
it
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Diggs;"always
<EOS>
provided
Mr.
Frewin
agrees
to
the
arrangement
,
unless
--
<EOS>
but
Ipresume
you
have
consulted
your
daughter
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
""My
daughter
has
been
accustomed
to
act
in
accordance
with
my
<EOS>
wishes,"returned
<EOS>
the
miser
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
sir
,
"
said
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"
I
merely
threw
out
thesuggestion
,
fearing
an
obstacle
might
occur
in
that
quarter
.
<EOS>
Myapprehension
was
that
the
young
lady
should
not
share
in
our
goodopinion
of
Mr.
Frewin
,
inasmuch
as
she
might
possibly
attach
a
littlemore
importance
to
external
appearances
than
we
do
,
forgetting
the
moreessential
qualities
.
<EOS>
I
am
quite
of
opinion
that
a
father
has
a
right
todispose
of
his
daughter
as
he
thinks
fit
.
<EOS>
All
laws
divine
and
human
giveyou
that
power
,
and
<EOS>
you
are
perfectly
justified
in
exercising
it
.
<EOS>
""I
act
as
I
believe
for
the
best
,
"
replied
the
miser
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
"
headded
,
as
if
anxious
to
change
the
subject
,
"
let
us
talk
on
othermatters
.
<EOS>
This
is
the
bond
from
Mr.
Villiers
;
the
annuity
from
Sir
ThomasLightfoot
:
and
the
four
thousand
pounds
Lady
Brabazon
wants
to
borrow
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
forthwith
plunged
into
details
in
which
it
is
unnecessary
tofollow
him
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
half
an
hour
,
Diggs
rose
to
depart
,
and
Jacob
was
summonedto
attend
him
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
significance
in
the
porter'smanner
that
satisfied
the
astute
attorney
he
had
been
playing
theeavesdropper
.
<EOS>
He
thought
it
therefore
expedient
to
make
friends
withhim
,
and
he
accordingly
slipped
a
crown
into
his
hand
as
he
went
forth
.
<EOS>
Jacob
did
not
refuse
the
gift
,
but
growled
out
as
he
fastened
the
door,"This
and
<EOS>
a
thousand
such
sha'n't
bribe
me
to
betray
my
young
missis
.
<EOS>
Ioverheard
all
their
scheming
,
and
she
shall
know
it
as
well
.
<EOS>
"Returning
<EOS>
to
the
parlour
,
he
found
the
miser
preparing
to
retire
,
andassisted
him
,
for
he
was
still
very
feeble
,
to
get
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
Themiser
's
bed
-
room
was
not
a
whit
better
furnished
than
the
lowerapartment
.
<EOS>
An
old
bedstead
,
without
hangings
,
stood
at
one
side
,
whileopposite
it
was
a
wash
-
stand
of
the
commonest
description
.
<EOS>
A
number
ofold
trunks
,
and
one
or
two
pictures
in
a
very
dusty
condition
,
werereared
against
the
walls
.
<EOS>
The
window
was
partly
boarded
up
,
partlygrated
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
small
closet
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
,
and
aside
door
,
though
now
fastened
up
,
communicated
with
the
chamberoccupied
by
the
two
ladies
.
<EOS>
A
small
table
,
a
stool
,
two
large
and
stoutoaken
chests
,
clamped
with
iron
,
and
a
bureau
of
the
same
material
,
constituted
the
furniture
of
the
closet
.
<EOS>
On
the
floor
were
laid
the
bagsof
gold
.
<EOS>
Having
glanced
at
the
heap
,
and
counted
it
with
his
eye
,
themiser
dismissed
Jacob
for
the
night
,
with
the
strictest
injunctions
tokeep
on
the
watch
,
for
fear
of
any
attempt
to
break
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
Andthe
better
to
enable
him
to
protect
the
premises
,
he
gave
him
apistol,--one
of
a
brace
,
which
he
always
kept
loaded
at
his
bed
-
side
.
<EOS>
Assoon
as
Jacob
was
gone
,
and
he
had
locked
the
door
,
he
set
down
thecandle
on
the
floor
,
and
with
trembling
eagerness
unfastened
one
of
thesacks
,
and
counted
its
glittering
contents
.
<EOS>
The
sum
was
right
.
<EOS>
He
undidanother
,
and
found
it
correct
;
another
,
and
another
,
and
the
sameresult
,
until
all
were
emptied
,
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
gold
.
<EOS>
Themiser
gazed
at
the
shining
treasure
,
vainly
trying
to
satiate
his
greedysoul
with
the
sight
;
and
then
at
last
,
as
if
unable
to
contain
himself
,
he
threw
himself
upon
the
heap
in
a
species
of
delirium
,
clutchinghandfuls
of
the
coin
,
and
throwing
them
over
him
.
<EOS>
His
transports
havingsubsided
,
he
arose
,
again
filled
the
sacks
,
tied
them
up
,
and
,
in
astate
of
high
nervous
excitement
that
forbade
any
hope
of
sleep
,
soughthis
couch
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
meanwhile
,
on
quitting
his
master
,
crept
stealthily
to
theladies
'
chamber
,
and
tapped
against
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
summons
wasimmediately
answered
by
Hilda
,
who
anxiously
inquired
what
was
thematter
?
<EOS>
Jacob
replied
,
in
a
low
tone
,
that
he
wished
to
say
a
word
toher
before
she
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Having
delivered
himself
thus
,
he
stoledown
stairs
,
and
Hilda
,
who
was
a
good
deal
alarmed
,
almost
instantlyfollowed
him
.
<EOS>
He
then
told
her
what
had
passed
between
Mr.
Scarve
andhis
attorney
,
concluding
thus
:
"
I
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
,
I
know
,
Miss
,
for
listening
,
and
it
's
not
my
habit
,
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
But
beingaware
that
Mr.
Diggs
is
Mr.
Philip
's
attorney
,
as
well
as
master
's
,
andcoupling
his
visit
with
what
occurred
this
morning
<EOS>
,
I
had
somemisgivings
as
to
his
errand
,
and
therefore
I
did
as
I
have
told
you
.
<EOS>
"Greatly
<EOS>
disturbed
by
the
intelligence
,
Hilda
thanked
the
porter
for
hiszeal
,
and
returned
noiselessly
to
her
room
,
where
she
found
relief
in
aplentiful
flood
of
tears
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clinton
tried
to
soothe
her
,
but
it
waslong
before
she
could
succeed
in
doing
so
.
<EOS>
"What
is
to
be
done
,
dear
aunt
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Hilda
<EOS>
;
"
I
know
my
father
too
wellto
doubt
that
,
having
resolved
upon
this
hateful
match
,
he
will
leavenothing
undone
to
accomplish
it
.
<EOS>
But
I
will
die
sooner
than
give
myconsent
.
<EOS>
""I
scarcely
know
how
to
advise
you
,
my
dear
niece
,
"
replied
Mrs
.
Clinton
,
"
I
do
not
like
to
counsel
you
to
disobey
your
father
,
and
yet
Ifeel
he
ought
not
to
force
your
inclinations
.
<EOS>
""Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Hilda
,
again
bursting
into
tears
,
"
I
have
no
friend
toturn
to
.
<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
you
have
one
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clinton
,
"
who
will
,
I
am
sure
,
assistyou
,
and
protect
you
,
if
necessary
.
<EOS>
But
do
not
question
me
further
onthe
subject
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Rest
satisfied
with
my
assurance
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
sweetniece
,
dry
your
tears
,
lay
your
head
on
the
pillow
,
and
try
to
composeyourself
to
slumber
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
all
will
be
right
,
and
there
may
be
nooccasion
to
apply
to
any
one
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
good
night
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hilda
compliedwith
her
aunt
's
suggestions,--but
sleep
shunned
her
eyelids
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
who
was
really
apprehensive
that
an
attempt
would
he
made
tobreak
into
the
house
that
night
,
determined
to
remain
on
the
watch
,
andwith
that
view
ensconced
himself
in
the
miser
's
arm
-
chair
,
<EOS>
where
,
however
,
he
found
it
impossible
to
resist
the
approaches
of
the
drowsygod
.
<EOS>
His
slumbers
were
long
and
sound
,
but
were
at
length
broke
by
thecreaking
of
a
door
.
<EOS>
Instantly
starting
to
his
feet
,
he
snatched
up
thepistol
which
lay
on
the
table
beside
him
,
and
presented
it
at
the
headof
the
intruder
,
who
proved
to
be
his
master
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
was
in
hisnight
dress
,
over
which
he
had
hastily
slipped
the
robe
he
ordinarilywore
,
and
thus
seen
in
the
bright
moonlight
,
for
he
had
no
candle
,
looked
almost
like
an
apparition
.
<EOS>
"Lord
bless
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jacob
,
lowering
the
pistol
;
"
how
you
dofrighten
one
!
<EOS>
I
took
you
for
a
househreaker
,
and
I
am
not
quite
sure
nowthat
you
are
n't
a
perturbed
sperrit
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
almost
wish
I
was
dead
,
Jacob
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
dolefully
.
"
<EOS>
Icannot
sleep
.
<EOS>
""Don't
wonder
at
it
,
"
replied
the
other
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
a
badconscience
.
<EOS>
I
can
sleep
soundly
enough
,
even
in
that
cheer
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
envy
you
,
Jacob
,
"
groaned
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
riches
do
n't
always
bring
peace
,
"
continued
Jacob
,
"
especially
whenthey've
been
unjustly
obtained
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
tell
you
what
'll
make
you
sleepas
sound
as
a
rock
.
<EOS>
Give
up
all
idea
of
marrying
your
daughter
to
yourmiserly
nephew
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
It
's
that
as
disturbs
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
you'redoing
wrong
in
harbouring
such
a
thought
.
<EOS>
""They're
<EOS>
all
leagued
against
me,--all
!
<EOS>
"
shrieked
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
Scoundrel
,
you
have
been
listening
to
what
passed
between
me
and
Mr.
Diggs
.
<EOS>
""I
wo
nt
deny
it
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
stoutly
;
"
I
have
.
<EOS>
And
I
tell
you
you'resacrificing
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
Your
nephew
is
n't
what
he
seems
,
and
Mr
.
<EOS>
Diggs
is
helpin
'
him
to
deceive
you
.
<EOS>
You
'll
find
'em
out
when
it
's
toolate
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mad
,
or
drunk
,
or
both
,
"
cried
Scarve
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
I
am
mad
<EOS>
,
it
's
a
very
composed
and
collected
<EOS>
kind
of
madness,"rejoined
Jacob
;
"
but
I
should
like
to
know
which
of
us
seems
most
like
amadman
;
you
,
who
ca
n't
rest
in
your
bed
,
or
me
,
who
can
sleep
like
a
topin
that
cheer?""Well
,
<EOS>
well
,
I
sha'n't
bandy
words
with
you
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
whoseteeth
were
chattering
with
cold
.
<EOS>
"
Is
all
safe?""I
suppose
so
,
"
answered
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
heard
nothing
.
<EOS>
Have
you?""I
thought
I
did
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
miser
,
"
but
it
might
be
your
snoring
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
go
to
bed
,
"
returned
Jacob
;
"
it
's
the
best
place
for
you
.
<EOS>
You'llcatch
your
death
of
cold
standing
there
.
<EOS>
If
it
'll
be
any
comfort
to
you
,
I
wo
nt
go
to
sleep
again
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
it
ca
n't
be
far
off
midnight
.
<EOS>
""It
has
just
gone
two
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
;
"
I
've
heard
the
Abbey
clockstrike
all
the
hours
,
"
And
,
refusing
Jacob
's
offer
of
assistance
,
hegroped
his
way
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"I
would
n't
be
him
for
all
his
wealth
,
"
thought
the
porter
,
as
helistened
to
his
retreating
footsteps
.
<EOS>
Jacob
was
as
good
as
his
word
.
<EOS>
He
kept
watch
till
it
was
broad
daylight
,
and
then
,
thinking
all
secure
,
betook
himself
to
bed
for
a
couple
ofhours
.
<EOS>
The
family
assembled
at
breakfast
as
usual
.
<EOS>
The
miser
looked
unusuallyhaggard
,
and
Hilda
's
countenance
betrayed
the
mental
suffering
she
hadundergone
.
<EOS>
Little
was
said
during
the
scanty
meal
;
and
as
soon
as
it
wasover
,
Mr.
Scarve
signified
to
his
sister
-
in
-
law
that
he
wished
to
havesome
private
conversation
with
his
daughter
,
upon
which
they
were
leftalone
together
.
<EOS>
He
then
,
without
any
circumlocution
,
and
in
a
much
moreperemptory
manner
than
he
had
adopted
before
,
told
her
that
he
intendedto
give
her
to
her
cousin
,
and
that
he
would
listen
to
no
furtherobjections
on
her
part
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
believe
you
will
persist
in
this
cruel
resolution
,
sir
,
"
criedHilda
.
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
to
deserve
such
treatment
?
<EOS>
But
do
not
think
youwill
succeed
in
your
design
.
<EOS>
I
repeat
what
I
said
yesterday
.
<EOS>
Neitherentreaties
,
nor
threats
,
shall
induce
me
to
marry
my
cousin
.
<EOS>
""I
will
discard
you
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
But
finding
her
wholly
unmoved
by
the
menace
,
he
commenced
pouring
fortha
torrent
of
invectives
against
the
sex
in
general
;
complaining
of
theanxiety
and
torment
they
occasioned
all
those
with
whom
they
wereconnected
,
whether
in
the
relation
of
wife
,
sister
,
or
daughter;charging
them
with
wilfulness
,
perversity
,
and
blindness
to
their
owninterests
;
and
ending
by
ordering
her
off
to
her
own
chamber
,
whithershe
was
very
glad
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
By
no
means
satisfied
with
himself
,
he
next
tried
to
occupy
his
mind
byreferring
to
his
account
book
;
but
it
would
not
do
,
and
unable
to
sitstill
,
he
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
.
<EOS>
He
hoped
that
Jacob
would
shewhimself
,
that
he
might
have
an
object
to
vent
his
anger
upon
;
but
theporter
,
having
some
notion
of
the
storm
that
was
brewing
for
him
,
keptsedulously
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
He
then
resolutely
returned
to
theaccount
-
book
,
and
had
at
last
succeeded
in
fixing
his
attention
to
it
,
when
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
Jacob
presently
afterwardsappeared
,
and
informed
him
that
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
was
without
.
<EOS>
Themiser
slightly
started
at
the
name
,
but
hastily
ordered
Jacob
to
admithim
.
<EOS>
A
friendly
greeting
took
place
between
the
miser
and
Firebras
,
atwhich
Jacob
was
rather
surprised
,
for
he
did
not
remember
to
have
seenthe
latter
before
;
but
he
thought
,
in
spite
of
all
his
affectedcordiality
,
that
his
master
would
have
willingly
dispensed
with
hisvisitor
's
company
.
<EOS>
Warned
by
what
had
occurred
on
the
previous
night
,
Mr.
Scarve
orderedJacob
to
go
below
,
and
took
the
precaution
to
see
that
his
injunctionswere
obeyed
.
<EOS>
Though
the
porter
's
curiosity
was
considerably
excited
bywhat
was
going
forward
,
he
did
not
dare
to
listen
for
fear
of
adiscovery
,
and
he
accordingly
whiled
the
time
by
applying
to
his
secretstore
of
provisions
.
<EOS>
In
about
an
hour
and
a
half
,
he
was
summoned
by
hismaster
,
who
told
him
he
was
going
out
on
business
,
and
desired
him
toattend
him
to
his
room
,
whither
he
proceeded
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
you
want
your
coat
,
sir
,
"
said
Jacob
;
and
,
opening
a
drawerin
the
chest
,
he
took
an
old
sad
-
coloured
garment
from
a
fadedhandkerchief
in
which
it
was
wrapped
,
and
assisted
his
master
to
put
iton
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
brought
an
old
three
-
cornered
hat
,
edged
withtarnished
lace
,
and
,
dusting
it
,
gave
it
to
the
miser
,
together
with
acrutch
handled
stick
.
<EOS>
Having
locked
the
door
of
the
closet
,
removed
the
key
,
and
put
it
in
hispocket
,
Mr.
Scarve
next
went
through
the
same
operation
at
the
doorcommunicating
with
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
not
return
till
evening
,
Jacob
,
"
he
said
:
"
take
care
of
thehouse
during
my
absence
.
<EOS>
""It
must
be
important
business
to
keep
you
out
so
long
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
staring
at
the
information
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
business
is
important
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
;
"
but
I
wish
you
wouldcheck
your
tendency
to
familiarity
<EOS>
--
it
is
growing
upon
you
,
and
I
amweary
of
it
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
descended
to
the
lower
room
,
and
taking
some
papers
fromCordwell
Firebras
,
which
the
latter
had
been
reading
,
put
them
in
hispocket
,
and
they
quitted
the
house
together

lost
not
a
moment
in
communicating
his
master
's
departure
to
hisyoung
,
mistress
;
and
Hilda
,
on
hearing
it
,
immediately
came
down
stairswith
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
my
dear
niece
,
"
said
Mrs.
Clinton
,
"
since
such
a
favourableopportunity
presents
itself
,
I
would
advise
you
to
apply
for
counsel
asto
how
you
should
act
to
the
person
I
told
you
would
befriend
you
.
<EOS>
Thisletter
,
committed
to
my
care
by
my
poor
sister
and
your
mother
,
waswritten
to
be
delivered
in
case
of
an
emergency
like
the
present
--
whichshe
,
but
too
surely
<EOS>
,
foresaw
might
arise,--and
<EOS>
it
can
not
fail
ofaccomplishing
its
object
.
<EOS>
""It
is
addressed
to
Mr.
Abel
Beechcroft
,
"
said
Hilda
,
glancing
at
theinscription
on
the
letter
as
she
took
it
from
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
that
isthe
uncle
of
the
young
man
who
was
here
the
night
before
last
.
<EOS>
I
cannottake
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
it
would
look
like
--
but
why
need
I
care
what
construction
isput
upon
my
visit
,
since
my
heart
acquits
me
of
any
improper
motive,"said
Hilda
.
"
<EOS>
Aunt
,
I
will
go
--
that
is
,
if
you
think
it
will
answer
anygood
purpose
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sure
it
will
,
"
urged
Mrs.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
"But
if
my
father
should
accidentally
return
during
our
absence,"rejoined
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
think
it
likely
he
will
do
so
,
"
returned
the
aunt
;
"
but
if
heshould
,
I
must
bear
the
brunt
of
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
Go
,
my
love
:
<EOS>
somethingtells
me
the
visit
will
be
productive
of
great
advantage
to
you
.
<EOS>
Jacobwill
accompany
you
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
yielded
at
length
to
her
aunt
's
entreaties
,
and
having
put
on
herwalking
attire
,
quitted
the
house
with
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
going
overWestminster
Bridge
,
they
proceeded
to
Parliament
Stairs
,
where
Jacobsaid
he
had
a
friend
,
a
waterman
,
who
would
lend
him
a
boat
,
in
whichthey
could
cross
the
river
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
assert
more
than
the
truth
.
<EOS>
Onreaching
the
stairs
,
the
first
person
he
encountered
was
the
friendlywaterman
in
question
,
who
,
on
learning
his
wishes
,
immediately
ran
downand
<EOS>
got
his
wherry
ready
.
<EOS>
Having
placed
Hilda
within
it
,
Jacob
took
offhis
coat
,
and
plying
the
oars
with
as
much
skill
as
the
best
rower
onthe
Thames
could
have
done
,
speedily
landed
her
at
Lambeth
,
and
securedthe
boat
,
where
he
inquired
the
way
to
Mr.
Beechcroft
's
house
.
<EOS>
A
walk
ofa
few
seconds
brought
them
to
it
.
<EOS>
Hilda
's
heart
trembled
as
she
knockedat
the
door
;
but
she
was
re
-
assured
by
the
kindly
aspect
of
Mr.
Jukes
,
who
answered
the
summons
.
<EOS>
She
stated
her
errand
to
the
butler
,
whoappeared
not
a
little
surprised
,
and
,
indeed
,
confounded
at
theannouncement
of
her
name
.
<EOS>
After
a
short
debate
with
himself
,
Mr.
Jukessaid
his
master
was
at
home
,
and
she
should
see
him
;
and
without
moreado
,
he
led
the
way
to
the
library
,
and
entered
it
,
followed
by
theothers
.
<EOS>
Abel
was
seated
beside
an
old
-
fashioned
bookcase
,
the
door
of
which
wasopen
,
disclosing
a
collection
of
goodly
tomes
,
and
had
placed
thebook
-
stand
supporting
the
volume
he
was
reading
,
in
such
a
position
asto
receive
the
full
light
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
So
much
was
he
engaged
in
hisstudies
,
that
he
did
not
hear
their
approach
.
<EOS>
In
the
hasty
glance
whichHilda
took
of
the
pictures
on
the
wall
,
the
most
noticeable
of
whichwere
a
copy
of
Rembrandt
's
'
Good
Samaritan
,
'
and
a
fine
painting
on
thesubject
of
Timon
of
Athens
,
she
thought
she
could
read
somewhat
of
thecharacter
of
the
owner
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
Little
time
,
however
,
was
allowedher
for
reflection
,
for
Mr.
Jukes
,
advancing
towards
his
master
's
chair
,
leaned
over
it
,
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
.
<EOS>
"What!--who
<EOS>
--
who
did
you
say
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
half
-
closing
the
book
hewas
reading
,
and
looking
sharply
and
anxiously
round
.
<EOS>
"
Who
did
you
say
,
Jukes?""Miss
Scarve
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
butler
;
"
she
has
brought
you
a
letter
.
<EOS>
""Tell
<EOS>
her
<EOS>
I
wo
nt
receive
it
--
<EOS>
wont
open
it
,
"
cried
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
Why
did
you
notsend
her
away
?
<EOS>
What
brings
her
here?""You
had
better
put
that
question
to
her
yourself
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr
.
Jukes
,
"
for
she
is
in
this
room
.
<EOS>
""Here
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
starting
to
his
feet
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
I
see
--
I
see
.
<EOS>
O
God!she
is
very
like
her
mother
.
<EOS>
""Calm
<EOS>
yourself
,
I
entreat
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
I
would
not
haveadmitted
her
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
but
that
she
told
me
the
letterwas
written
by
her
mother
,
and
left
to
be
delivered
to
you
underpeculiar
circumstances
,
which
have
now
arisen
.
<EOS>
I
could
n't
resist
a
plealike
<EOS>
that,--nor
<EOS>
could
you
,
sir
,
I
'm
sure
.
<EOS>
""A
letter
written
to
me
by
her
mother
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
shivering
,
as
ifsmitten
by
an
ague
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Leave
us
,
Jukes
,
and
take
that
man
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Come
,
friend
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
to
Jacob
,
who
,
with
his
crab
-
stick
underhis
arm
,
stood
gazing
curiously
on
,
"
you
had
better
adjourn
with
me
<EOS>
tothe
butler
's
pantry
.
<EOS>
""Thank'ee
kindly
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
in
tones
a
little
less
gruff
thanusual
,
for
he
was
somewhat
awe
-
stricken
;
"
I
would
rather
stay
with
myyoung
missis
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
do
n't
you
see
you
're
in
the
way
,
man
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Jukes
,
impatiently
;
"
they
ca
n't
talk
before
us
.
<EOS>
Come
along
.
"
<EOS>
And
despite
hisresistance
,
he
pushed
Jacob
out
of
the
room
,
and
closed
the
door
afterhim
.
<EOS>
"You
have
a
letter
for
me
,
Miss
Scarve
<EOS>
,
I
believe
;
"
faltered
Abel
in
avoice
hollow
and
broken
by
emotion
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
,
giving
it
to
him
.
<EOS>
Abel
looked
at
the
address
,
and
another
sharp
convulsion
passed
over
hisframe
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
controlled
himself
by
a
powerful
effort
,
and
brokethe
seal
.
<EOS>
The
perusal
of
the
letter
seemed
to
affect
him
deeply
,
forstaggering
to
his
chair
,
he
sank
into
it
,
and
covering
his
face
with
hishands
,
wept
aloud
.
<EOS>
It
was
some
minutes
before
he
arose
.
<EOS>
Hilda
,
who
hadwatched
him
with
much
concern
,
was
surprised
to
see
how
calm
he
looked
.
<EOS>
He
had
indeed
regained
the
mastery
he
usually
held
over
his
feelings
.
<EOS>
"Pray
be
seated
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
he
said
handing
her
a
chair
.
<EOS>
"
I
wouldhave
shunned
this
interview
if
it
had
been
in
my
power
,
but
as
it
hasbeen
brought
about
,
I
will
not
shrink
from
it
.
<EOS>
How
can
I
serve
you?"Hilda
then
proceeded
to
explain
the
object
of
her
visit
.
<EOS>
Abel
listenedto
her
recital
with
a
quivering
lip
and
flashing
eye
,
and
at
its
closegot
up
,
and
took
a
quick
turn
round
the
room
.
<EOS>
"This
is
only
what
might
be
expected
from
him
--
scoundrel
!
"
<EOS>
heejaculated
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Sell
his
daughter!--but
that
is
nothing
,
he
would
sell
hissoul
for
gold
!
<EOS>
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
he
added
,
checkinghimself
,
as
he
saw
the
pain
his
exclamations
occasioned
her
,
"
<EOS>
but
if
youknew
the
deep
and
irremediable
injury
inflicted
on
me
by
your
father
,
you
would
pardon
this
outbreak
of
passion
.
<EOS>
He
has
sacrificed
otherswithout
scruple
,
but
he
shall
not
sacrifice
you
.
<EOS>
You
may
count
on
myassistance
,
my
protection
,
if
you
choose
to
confide
in
me
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
my
mother
's
injunction
to
confide
in
you
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"Your
mother
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
Hilda
!
<EOS>
what
afearful
spell
is
there
in
that
word!--what
<EOS>
a
host
of
feelings
does
itnot
summon
up
!
<EOS>
I
see
your
mother
again
as
I
remember
her
in
heryouth,--beautiful
as
you
are
,
more
beautiful
,
if
possible
--
certainlymore
blooming
.
<EOS>
I
hear
the
music
of
her
voice
as
I
listen
to
your
's
.
<EOS>
Ifeel
again
the
charm
inspired
by
her
presence
.
<EOS>
You
shall
learn
myhistory
one
of
these
days
,
and
you
will
then
know
why
your
motheraddressed
this
letter
to
me
--
why
it
affects
me
thus
.
<EOS>
""I
can
partly
guess
the
cause
,
"
returned
Hilda
,
mournfully
;
"
but
be
itwhat
<EOS>
it
may
,
it
is
plain
<EOS>
she
felt
she
had
a
strong
hold
on
youraffections,--and
that
she
thought
she
could
rely
on
you
,
when
she
couldrely
on
no
one
else
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
she
thought
so
<EOS>
,
she
thought
rightly
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
consider
herrequest
as
a
sacred
injunction
,
and
will
strive
to
comply
with
it
.
<EOS>
Andnow
,
"
he
added
,
changing
his
tone
,
"
I
must
tell
you
that
your
name
hasbeen
brought
before
me
of
late
.
<EOS>
My
nephew
,
Randulph
Crew
,
who
visitedyour
father
the
other
night
,
has
spoken
of
you
to
me
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
slightly
coloured
.
<EOS>
"He
will
regret
much
not
being
at
home
this
morning
,
"
pursued
Abel
,
"
ashe
might
have
had
an
opportunity
of
further
cultivating
his
acquaintancewith
you
.
<EOS>
But
he
is
gone
out
with
my
brother
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
it
will
not
offend
you
to
say
I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
replied
Hilda;"I
would
not
willingly
have
met
him
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
so
?
"
asked
Abel
,
who
,
however
,
looked
somewhat
relieved
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
,
sir
,
I
will
be
frank
with
you
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
own
that
myfather
attributes
my
increased
dislike
of
my
cousin
to
a
predilectionfor
your
nephew
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
may
I
expect
equal
frankness
in
the
reply
,
if
I
ask
whether
thereis
any
truth
in
your
father
's
supposition
?
"
rejoined
Abel
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
may
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Your
nephew
appears
a
very
amiable
andpleasing
young
man
,
but
having
seen
him
only
for
a
few
minutes
,
I
cannotpossibly
feel
any
interest
in
him
,
beyond
such
as
might
be
inspired
byany
stranger
of
equally
prepossessing
appearance
and
manners
.
<EOS>
Myaversion
to
my
cousin
arises
from
various
causes
.
<EOS>
I
half
suspect
him
ofacting
a
very
base
part
towards
my
father
,
who
resolutely
shuts
his
eyesto
the
deception
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
affect
to
deny
that
I
am
pleased
with
what
you
say
of
yourindifference
to
my
nephew
,
Hilda
,
"
returned
Abel
,
"
because
I
have
otherviews
in
reference
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
to
your
cousin
,
Philip
Frewin
,
I
will
makestrict
inquiries
about
him
,
and
if
your
suspicions
prove
correct
,
I
willmyself
unmask
him
to
your
father
,
which
may
perhaps
put
an
end
to
thematter
.
<EOS>
He
lives
in
Fenchurch
-
street
,
you
say
.
<EOS>
It
so
happens
that
an
oldfriend
of
mine
,
a
widow
lady
,
Mrs.
Verral,--a
friend
of
your
mother's
,
by
the
by,--resides
in
that
street
.
<EOS>
She
is
an
excellent
woman
,
but
alittle
of
a
busy
-
body
and
a
gossip
,
and
makes
it
her
business
to
knowher
neighbours
'
concerns
better
than
her
own
.
<EOS>
I
'll
venture
to
say
she
isacquainted
with
your
cousin
's
affairs
.
<EOS>
I
have
n't
seen
the
old
lady
oflate
,
because
,
as
you
may
perhaps
have
heard
,
I
have
little
intercoursewith
<EOS>
your
sex
--
my
habits
and
indeed
feelings
unfitting
me
for
<EOS>
theirsociety,--but
<EOS>
I
happen
to
know
from
my
brother
Trussell
that
she
iswell
.
<EOS>
You
had
better
go
to
her
yourself
.
<EOS>
I
will
give
you
a
note
ofintroduction
--
though
,
indeed
,
it
is
not
needed
,
for
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
she
is
an
old
friend
of
your
mother
's
.
<EOS>
In
addition
to
gaining
all
theinformation
you
may
require
respecting
your
cousin
,
you
will
acquire
afriend
with
whom
you
may
take
refuge
,
if
matters
--
which
we
will
notanticipate
--
should
unhappily
render
such
a
step
necessary
.
<EOS>
""I
will
do
as
you
suggest
,
sir
,
"
replied
Hilda
;
"
but
suppose
I
shouldencounter
my
cousin?""Tell
him
where
you
are
going
,
"
replied
Abel
,
"
and
depend
upon
it
,
if
heis
not
what
he
represents
himself
to
be
,
he
will
be
the
first
to
takealarm
.
<EOS>
I
will
myself
institute
inquiries
about
him
in
another
quarter
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
he
proceeded
to
a
table
,
on
which
writing
materials
wereplaced
,
and
hastily
penned
a
note
,
and
gave
it
to
Hilda
.
"And
<EOS>
now
,
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
my
dear
child
,
"
he
said
,
affectionately,--"ifcalled
<EOS>
upon
by
circumstances
,
you
shall
never
want
a
father
or
protectorin
me
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
then
rang
the
bell
,
and
Mr.
Jukes
presently
appeared
,
<EOS>
who
informedhim
that
Jacob
had
just
sat
down
to
dinner
with
the
other
servants
.
<EOS>
"I
think
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
,
"
it
is
the
first
good
meal
hehas
made
for
many
a
day
,
and
it
would
be
a
pity
to
call
him
from
it
<EOS>
,
ifMiss
Scarve
is
not
in
a
great
hurry
.
<EOS>
"Abel
appealed
to
Hilda
,
and
as
she
raised
no
objection
,
he
proposed
toher
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
till
he
had
finished
his
meal
,
andaccordingly
opened
the
window
and
led
her
forth
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Hilda
had
become
more
composed
,
and
being
quite
easy
<EOS>
withthe
old
man
,
for
whom
indeed
she
felt
a
growing
regard
,
she
enteredreadily
into
conversation
with
him
;
and
thus
more
than
half
an
hour
flewby
,
almost
without
their
being
aware
of
its
flight
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
thattime
,
Mr.
Jukes
made
his
appearance
,
and
informed
them
that
Jacob
wasready
.
<EOS>
Abel
attended
his
fair
visitor
to
the
door
.
<EOS>
"If
you
do
not
find
Mrs.
Verral
at
home
,
"
he
said
,
"
or
if
anythingshould
occur
to
make
you
wish
to
see
me
again
,
do
not
hesitate
to
comeback
.
<EOS>
But
in
any
event
you
shall
hear
from
me
--
perhaps
see
me
,
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
God
bless
you
!
<EOS>
my
child
.
"
<EOS>
And
taking
her
hand
,
he
pressed
itto
his
lips
,
and
when
Hilda
withdrew
it
,
she
found
it
wet
with
histears
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Jacob
shook
the
hospitable
butler
,
for
whom
hehad
conceived
a
great
liking
,
warmly
by
the
hand
,
and
then
strode
onbefore
his
young
mistress
,
towards
the
stairs
where
he
had
left
theboat
.
<EOS>
Having
placed
her
within
it
,
and
divested
himself
of
his
coat
,
cravat
,
and
hat
,
as
before
,
he
enquired
where
she
meant
to
go
,
and
beingtold
to
London
Bridge
,
pulled
off
with
vigorous
strokes
in
thatdirection

RANDULPH
PLACED
IN
AN
AWKWARDSITUATION
BY
PHILIP
FREWIN.The
Folly
on
the
Thames
,
whither
Beau
Villiers
and
his
party
weresteering
their
course
,
was
a
large
floating
house
of
entertainmentmoored
in
the
centre
of
the
stream
,
immediately
opposite
Old
SomersetHouse
.
<EOS>
It
was
constructed
in
the
latter
part
of
the
reign
of
Charles
theSecond
;
and
thither
the
Merry
Monarch
,
who
was
excessively
fond
ofaquatic
amusements
of
all
kinds
,
would
frequently
repair
with
hiscourtiers
and
frolic
dames
.
<EOS>
Thither
also
Queen
Mary
,
the
consort
ofWilliam
the
Third
,
repaired
on
the
occasion
of
a
grand
musicalentertainment
;
and
the
place
continued
in
vogue
for
many
years
,
until
atlength
,
degenerating
in
its
character
,
it
became
the
haunt
of
a
verydisreputable
part
of
the
community
.
<EOS>
The
Folly
resembled
a
largeone
-
storied
house
,
very
long
in
proportion
to
its
width
,
built
upon
animmense
barge
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
platform
at
the
top
,
defended
by
a
strongwooden
balustrade
,
and
flanked
at
each
corner
by
a
little
wooden
turret
,
with
a
pointed
top
,
surmounted
by
a
small
streamer
.
<EOS>
These
turretsconstituted
small
drinking
and
smoking
rooms
,
and
were
fitted
up
withseats
and
tables
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
structure
was
a
sort
of
openbelvidere
,
covering
the
main
staircase
leading
to
the
roof
.
<EOS>
On
this
alarge
flag
was
planted
.
<EOS>
The
Folly
was
approached
from
the
water
by
stepson
three
sides
.
<EOS>
It
was
lighted
by
a
range
of
large
and
handsome
windows
,
and
entered
by
two
doors
,
one
at
the
end
,
and
the
other
at
the
side
.
<EOS>
Within
,
it
contained
a
long
music
-
hall
,
with
a
frescoed
ceiling
,
gildedand
painted
walls
,
an
orchestra
,
and
the
necessary
complement
ofbenches
,
chairs
,
and
small
tables
.
<EOS>
There
was
,
moreover
,
a
bar
,
where
allsorts
of
liquors
,
materials
for
smoking
,
and
other
tavern
luxuries
weredispensed
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
structure
was
divided
into
a
number
of
smallapartments
for
private
parties
,
and
in
short
,
boasted
every
sort
ofaccommodation
afforded
by
a
similar
place
of
entertainment
on
shore
.
<EOS>
Insummer
it
was
delightful
--
the
view
of
the
Thames
from
its
summit
beingenchanting
.
<EOS>
The
coolness
and
freshness
,
combined
with
the
enliveninginfluences
of
beauty
,
wine
,
and
music
,
must
have
made
it
,
on
its
firstestablishment
,
a
charming
place
of
recreation
;
and
it
can
not
be
wonderedthat
the
Merry
Monarch
and
his
merrier
court
,
found
it
so
much
to
theirtaste
.
<EOS>
As
the
party
approached
the
aquatic
hotel
,
they
perceived
a
number
ofpersons
of
both
sexes
,
seated
on
the
roof
,
and
in
the
little
turretparlours
,
smoking
,
drinking
,
or
otherwise
amusing
themselves
,
whilelively
strains
proceeded
from
within
.
<EOS>
Several
small
craft
were
landingtheir
passengers
,
and
from
one
,
a
tilt
boat
,
there
issued
a
very
prettyyoung
woman
,
though
of
rather
bold
appearance
,
who
,
as
she
took
the
handof
a
young
man
,
in
her
ascent
of
the
steps
,
displayed
a
remarkably
neatfoot
and
ankle
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
deck
,
she
turned
for
a
moment
to
surveythe
scene
,
and
her
eye
alighting
on
Randulph
,
his
good
looks
appeared
torivet
her
attention
.
<EOS>
This
fascinating
creature
seemed
to
be
about
twenty
,
had
auburn
hair
,
very
regular
features
,
a
brilliant
complexion
--
whether
wholly
indebtedto
art
might
be
questioned
--
but
there
could
be
no
question
as
to
thenatural
brilliancy
of
her
hazel
eyes
,
and
wore
a
pink
silk
hooped
gown
,
made
very
low
in
front
,
so
as
to
display
her
beautifully
formed
andradiantly
white
neck
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Her
sleeves
were
very
short
,
probably
so
contrived
with
a
view
of
exhibiting
her
rounded
arms
,
andedged
with
lace
.
<EOS>
A
white
silk
apron
,
embroidered
with
silver
,
a
prettyfly
cap
,
and
a
necklace
of
precious
stones
,
from
which
depended
adiamond
cross
,
completed
her
attire
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
by
whom
she
wasattended
had
a
slight
thin
figure
,
and
sharp
disagreeable
features
,
withrather
an
apish
expression
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
with
much
smartness
,
but
hadby
<EOS>
no
means
the
air
of
a
gentleman
,
and
seemed
to
be
regarded
withindifference
,
almost
amounting
to
contempt
,
by
his
female
companion
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
that
young
lady
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Randulph
of
Sir
Singleton
,
who
happenedto
sit
next
him
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
me
see
,
"
exclaimed
the
old
beau
,
placing
his
glass
to
his
eye
.
"
<EOS>
Ah!gadzooks
!
'
<EOS>
tis
the
delicious
creature
I
mentioned
to
you,--the
littleHaymarket
actress
,
Kitty
Conway!""Kitty
Conway
!
<EOS>
where
is
she
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Trussell
,
who
heard
the
remark
,
<EOS>
butwhose
back
was
towards
the
object
of
their
admiration
.
<EOS>
Sir
Singleton
pointed
her
out
,
and
upon
the
instant
every
eye
wasdirected
towards
her
.
<EOS>
Whether
unable
to
stand
so
fierce
a
fire
,
orwhether
,
as
is
more
probable
,
dragged
away
by
her
companion
,
who
did
notappear
to
relish
the
notice
she
attracted
,
it
is
needless
to
inquire
,
but
Kitty
suddenly
vanished
from
their
sight
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
is
n't
she
delicious
?
"
cried
the
old
beau
to
Randulph
.
"
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
youhave
made
a
conquest
of
pretty
Kitty
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
parting
glanceshe
gave
you
over
her
shoulder
as
she
whisked
through
the
door
.
<EOS>
Don'tlose
sight
of
her
.
<EOS>
You
can
soon
put
the
city
beau
by
whom
she
isattended
hors
-
de
-
combat
.
<EOS>
"Further
<EOS>
remarks
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
boat
at
thesteps
.
<EOS>
A
strange
,
black
-
muzzled
fellow
,
in
a
Guernsey
shirt
,
with
barearms
and
bare
legs
,
and
who
was
a
regular
attendant
at
the
Folly
,
helpedthem
to
disembark
;
and
his
request
to
'
be
remembered
'
by
the
Beau
beingmet
with
a
very
munificent
rejoinder
,
he
well
-
nigh
lost
his
balance
inhis
glee
,
and
got
a
tumble
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
The
party
then
entered
the
music
-
hall
,
and
just
as
they
passed
throughthe
door
,
Randulph
chancing
to
look
behind
him
,
perceived
that
thestranger
had
likewise
landed
,
and
was
mounting
the
steps
.
<EOS>
The
novelscene
,
however
,
before
him
so
completely
engrossed
his
attention
,
thathe
could
think
of
little
else
.
<EOS>
Upwards
of
a
hundred
persons
of
bothsexes
thronged
the
room
;
many
of
the
ladies
were
masked
,
and
a
good
dealof
freedom
marked
their
conduct
.
<EOS>
They
talked
and
laughed
loudly
andrecklessly
.
<EOS>
At
one
end
of
the
hall
the
benches
were
taken
aside
to
allowKitty
Conway
and
her
companion
,
with
some
other
couples
,
to
perform
thecushion
dance
.
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
of
the
room
stood
the
musicians
.
<EOS>
Theparty
made
their
way
towards
the
dancers
,
and
the
Beau
and
Sir
Singletonpraised
Kitty
's
beauty
in
tones
so
loud
,
and
in
terms
of
admiration
sostrong
,
as
would
have
occasioned
confusion
to
any
young
lady
troubledwith
a
more
oppressive
sense
of
bashfulness
than
she
was
.
<EOS>
Her
partnerdid
not
know
whether
to
look
pleased
or
annoyed
.
<EOS>
He
was
evidentlyoverpowered
by
the
presence
of
Beau
Villiers
,
whom
he
regarded
with
aspecies
of
awe
;
and
as
these
applauses
of
Kitty
gave
a
fanciedconsequence
to
himself
,
he
was
weak
enough
to
be
gratified
by
them
.
<EOS>
Towards
the
close
of
the
figure
,
a
particular
step
,
executed
by
thepretty
actress
,
elicited
more
than
usual
rapture
from
Sir
Singleton
,
andhe
called
to
Randulph--"Look
at
her
,
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
.
<EOS>
Is
it
notdelicious?"At
the
sound
of
this
name
,
Kitty
's
partner
stared
so
hard
at
Randulph
,
that
he
could
scarcely
finish
the
dance
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
my
word
,
Philip
Frewin
,
you
are
a
very
stupid
partner
,
"
said
theactress
to
him
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
not
exert
yourself
more
,
I
shall
ask
thatpretty
young
fellow
,
who
is
ogling
me
there
,
to
take
my
hand
in
the
nextset
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
fatigued
,
Kitty
,
"
replied
Philip
,
confusedly
;
"
let
us
haverefreshment
--
a
little
'
rack
punch
,
or
a
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
"Kitty
<EOS>
Conway
consented
,
and
they
moved
off
to
one
of
the
side
tables
,
where
a
waiter
speedily
placed
glasses
before
them
,
and
opened
a
bottleof
champagne
.
<EOS>
It
must
be
confessed
--
unwilling
as
we
are
to
admitit
--
that
Randulph
was
not
altogether
proof
against
the
undisguisedadmiration
of
the
pretty
actress
,
and
that
he
could
not
help
returningthe
tender
glances
she
shot
towards
him
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
performances
went
forward
;
an
Irish
jig
followed
,
inwhich
Randulph
and
Sir
Singleton
joined
;
this
was
succeeded
by
somecomic
songs
;
and
Mr.
Villiers
,
who
did
not
altogether
relish
theentertainment
,
walked
forth
,
and
was
soon
after
followed
by
the
others
.
<EOS>
As
they
all
stood
leaning
over
the
sides
of
the
bark
,
laughing
at
whathad
occurred
,
and
admiring
the
gaiety
of
the
scene
,
a
wherry
,
impelledby
a
vigorous
rower
,
as
was
evident
by
the
progress
it
made
,
andcontaining
a
young
female
,
wrapped
in
a
black
silk
scarf
,
and
with
raventresses
,
scarcely
covered
by
the
small
bonnet
,
floating
in
the
breeze
,
rapidly
neared
them
.
<EOS>
Various
speculations
were
put
forth
as
to
whetherthis
young
female
would
prove
as
pretty
on
a
nearer
inspection
as
shelooked
at
a
distance
;
but
in
these
Randulph
took
little
part
.
<EOS>
To
speaktruth
,
his
thoughts
were
running
upon
the
fair
syren
within
,
andhappening
to
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
platform
above
,
he
perceived
,
leaning
over
the
balustrade
and
gazing
at
him
,
the
stranger!At
<EOS>
this
juncture
,
Philip
Frewin
came
forth
to
see
whether
his
boat
wasin
readiness
,
and
admonished
the
watermen
,
one
of
whom
was
philanderingwith
a
buxom
damsel
,
who
was
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
deck
,
that
heshould
start
immediately
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
,
however
,
issued
the
orderthan
his
eye
fell
upon
the
boat
containing
the
young
female
beforementioned
,
and
which
was
now
close
at
hand
.
<EOS>
He
started
as
if
anapparition
had
met
his
gaze
,
ducked
down
,
and
would
have
made
his
escapeinto
<EOS>
the
music
-
hall
,
if
Kitty
Conway
had
not
placed
herself
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
Retreat
was
now
impossible
,
and
Philip
's
distress
was
heightened
by
thefair
actress
,
who
exclaimed
,
somewhat
pettishly
,
"
Why
do
you
leave
mehere
,
sir
?
<EOS>
Why
do
n't
you
hand
me
to
the
boat?"Philip
was
almost
at
his
wits
'
end
.
<EOS>
The
boat
containing
Hilda
and
Jacob
,
both
of
whom
he
had
too
clearly
recognised
,
though
he
could
not
accountfor
their
appearance
,
unless
it
were
a
trick
of
the
fiend
to
convicthim
,
was
so
near
,
that
if
he
complied
with
Kitty
's
request
,
discoverywould
be
inevitable
.
<EOS>
A
plan
suddenly
occurred
to
him
,
by
which
he
hopedto
free
himself
from
risk
,
and
place
Randulph
,
whom
he
had
reason
toregard
as
a
rival
,
in
an
awkward
dilemma
.
<EOS>
Without
apprising
her
of
hisintention
,
he
drew
the
pretty
actress
forward
,
and
bending
down
as
lowas
he
could
,
to
elude
observation
,
said
to
Randulph--"Will
you
have
thekindness
,
sir
,
to
hand
this
lady
into
her
boat
?
<EOS>
You
will
do
me
aninfinite
favour
,
I
have
dropped
a
pocket
-
book
in
the
music
-
hall
,
andmust
go
back
to
search
for
it
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
was
a
good
deal
surprised
by
the
proposal
,
but
heunhesitatingly
assented
;
and
taking
Kitty
's
hand
,
which
she
verygraciously
accorded
,
rewarding
his
attention
by
a
slight
squeeze
,
ledher
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
All
this
occurred
to
the
infinite
amusement
ofTrussell
,
who
stood
a
little
back
near
the
door
,
ogling
a
rather
prettydamsel
,
and
to
the
no
slight
chagrin
of
Sir
Singleton
,
who
,
guessing
theintention
of
Philip
Frewin
,
had
pushed
forward
to
offer
his
services
,
but
found
himself
supplanted
.
<EOS>
But
these
were
not
the
only
witnesses
ofthe
scene
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
boat
,
containing
Hilda
,
had
come
up
,
andwith
a
pang
of
jealous
feeling
,
neither
to
be
accounted
for
,
norcontrolled
<EOS>
,
she
beheld
Randulph
handing
the
pretty
actress
,
whosecharacter
she
could
scarcely
mistake
,
down
the
steps
.
<EOS>
Jacob
saw
what
waspassing
as
well
as
herself
,
but
,
having
no
jealousy
to
divert
hisattention
from
other
matters
,
he
detected
Philip
Frewin
even
in
hisdisguise
,
and
,
resting
on
his
oars
,
exclaimed
,
"
Look
!
<EOS>
miss
,
look!--thereis
your
cousin
Philip
.
<EOS>
Is
that
the
dress
he
wore
yesterday
?
<EOS>
I
toldmaster
he
was
n't
what
he
seemed
.
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
Hilda
was
too
much
agitated
to
heed
these
exclamations
.
<EOS>
She
couldsee
nothing
but
Randulph
and
the
pretty
actress
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
she
withoutembarrassment
on
her
own
account
;
for
Mr.
Cripps
,
having
recognised
her
,
pointed
her
out
to
his
master
,
and
the
Beau
,
being
much
struck
with
herbeauty
,
favored
her
with
a
very
insolent
stare
.
<EOS>
But
if
Randulph
had
beenguilty
of
disloyalty
towards
the
object
of
his
affections
,
hispunishment
was
not
long
delayed
;
for
,
as
he
handed
Kitty
into
the
boat
,
which
was
steadied
by
the
black
-
muzzled
Jack
,
before
mentioned
,
his
gazeencountered
that
of
Hilda
,
and
he
was
instantly
filled
with
confusion
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
disengage
himself
from
the
actress
,
who
,
however
,
sportivelydetained
him
,
and
,
unable
to
retreat
,
he
cut
a
most
ridiculous
figure
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
was
not
a
little
relieved
,
though
he
felt
how
much
he
shouldsink
in
her
esteem
,
when
he
saw
Hilda
bend
forward
,
and
ordered
Jacob
,
who
continued
resting
on
his
oars
,
to
pass
on
.
<EOS>
He
continued
gazing
afterthe
boat
till
it
was
out
of
sight
;
but
Hilda
did
not
look
back
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
as
Philip
Frewin
did
not
make
his
appearance
,
Kitty
Conwaybecame
very
impatient
,
and
turning
a
deaf
ear
to
all
the
high
flowncompliments
showered
upon
her
by
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
entreatedRandulph
to
go
and
see
what
her
friend
was
doing
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
couldnot
very
well
refuse
compliance
with
the
request
,
and
he
accordinglyentered
the
music
-
hall
,
and
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
Philip
,
whofinding
the
coast
clear
,
recovered
his
composure
,
and
tendering
histhanks
,
in
a
very
abject
manner
,
to
Randulph
,
got
into
the
boat
withKitty
,
and
ordered
the
men
to
row
to
Savoy
Stairs
.
<EOS>
Randulph
was
tooangry
with
himself
,
and
now
too
indifferent
to
the
fascinations
of
thepretty
actress
,
to
return
the
tender
glance
with
which
she
favoured
himon
her
departure
.
<EOS>
The
incident
,
however
,
afforded
abundant
merriment
to
his
companions
,
who
were
greatly
diverted
by
his
looks
,
which
they
attributed
tojealousy
;
and
they
endeavoured
to
remove
the
feeling
by
assuring
himthat
Kitty
had
exhibited
a
decided
preference
for
him
.
<EOS>
His
uneasinesswas
not
relieved
by
the
admiration
expressed
of
the
miser
's
daughter
byBeau
Villiers
;
nor
was
Trussell
altogether
pleased
to
find
the
Beau
somuch
captivated
.
<EOS>
That
Hilda
should
have
passed
at
the
precise
junctureseemed
to
surprise
everybody
.

CHAPTER
XIV.--RANDULPH
'S
INTERVIEW
WITH
CORDWELL
FIREBRAS
IN
THE
CLOISTERS
OFWESTMINSTER
<EOS>
ABBEY.Shortly
after
this
,
the
party
entered
their
boat
,
and
returned
toWhitehall
Stairs
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
been
so
much
engrossed
by
his
ownfeelings
that
he
forgot
the
stranger
,
and
only
called
him
to
mind
a
fewminutes
after
he
had
landed
,
and
when
it
was
too
late
to
look
for
him
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
however
forget
his
appointment
with
the
writer
of
themysterious
letter
,
and
regardless
of
the
construction
that
might
be
putupon
it
,
told
his
uncle
he
had
a
particular
engagement
,
which
he
mustkeep
,
at
six
o'clock
.
<EOS>
Trussell
smiled
significantly
at
the
announcement
,
but
made
no
remark
,
and
proposed
that
they
all
should
dine
at
one
of
theFrench
ordinaries
in
Suffolk
-
street
.
<EOS>
Beau
Villiers
pleaded
anengagement
,
but
Sir
Singleton
acquiesced
,
and
the
trio
repaired
to
theordinary
,
where
an
excellent
dinner
was
set
before
them
.
<EOS>
Randulph
,
mindful
of
his
appointment
,
in
spite
of
the
jokes
of
hiscompanions
,
who
strove
to
detain
him
,
got
up
from
table
at
five
o'clock
,
and
took
his
way
past
Charing
cross
and
Whitehall
,
towards
the
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Hecould
not
resist
the
impulse
that
prompted
him
to
pass
through
theLittle
Sanctuary
,
and
felt
half
disposed
to
call
at
the
miser
's
,
andoffer
some
explanation
of
his
conduct
to
Hilda
.
<EOS>
Though
the
absurdity
ofthe
notion
caused
him
to
abandon
it
almost
as
soon
as
formed
,
helingered
before
the
house
for
a
few
minutes
,
in
the
hope
of
discerningsome
of
its
inmates
,
but
was
disappointed
.
<EOS>
He
then
entered
PeterPokerich
's
shop
,
to
inquire
the
way
to
the
Abbey
cloisters
.
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
the
little
barber
was
about
to
take
a
walk
with
the
fairThomasine
,
who
was
standing
with
him
,
and
he
offered
to
conduct
Randulphto
the
cloisters
;
but
this
the
young
man
,
who
had
his
own
reasons
fornot
desiring
the
attendance
of
the
inquisitive
barber
,
declined
,
but
insuch
a
way
as
to
excite
Peter
's
curiosity
,
who
secretly
determined
tofollow
him
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Randulph
was
gone
,
he
mentioned
his
design
to
thefair
Thomasine
,
who
was
nothing
loath
to
accompany
him
,
and
they
set
outtogether
,
taking
special
care
to
keep
out
of
Randulph
's
view
.
<EOS>
The
youngman
shaped
his
course
towards
the
Abbey
,
and
skirting
its
westernextremity
,
passed
under
the
archway
leading
to
the
play
-
ground
ofWestminster
school
.
<EOS>
Here
he
paused
,
and
,
addressing
a
porter
,
wasdirected
towards
another
archway
,
through
which
he
passed
,
and
enteredthe
cloisters
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
this
,
Peter
,
still
accompanied
by
his
faircompanion
,
ran
forward
,
and
finding
that
Randulph
was
walking
in
thesouth
ambulatory
,
they
struck
into
the
west
,
being
still
able
to
watchhim
through
the
open
columns
.
<EOS>
Randulph
,
meanwhile
,
unconscious
that
he
was
the
object
of
suchscrutiny
,
slowly
traversed
the
ambulatory
,
and
,
charmed
with
theexquisite
groined
arches
of
its
roof
,
hoary
with
age
,
and
the
viewafforded
through
the
shafted
windows
looking
into
the
quadrangle
,
of
thereverend
buttresses
and
of
the
Abbey
,
almost
forgot
the
object
thatbrought
him
thither
.
<EOS>
He
was
arrested
at
the
eastern
extremity
by
theancient
inscriptions
and
brasses
,
pointing
out
the
resting
-
places
of
theold
abbots
Laurentius
,
Gislesbertus
,
and
Vitalis
,
when
a
heavy
footstepsounded
on
his
ear
,
and
looking
up
,
he
beheld
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
Before
hecould
recover
his
surprise
at
this
unexpected
apparition
,
the
new
comeradvanced
towards
him
,
and
with
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
,
and
asingularly
significant
smile
,
said--"So
,
you
have
kept
your
appointmentwith
me
,
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
.
<EOS>
""Are
<EOS>
you
,
then
,
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Randulph
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
so
called
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"I
was
little
aware
,
sir
,
when
I
saw
you
this
morning
at
the
barber's
,
how
soon
and
how
strangely
we
should
be
brought
together
again,"rejoined
<EOS>
Randulph
;
"
but
this
in
some
measure
accounts
for
the
manner
inwhich
you
have
hunted
me
throughout
the
day
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
you
will
nowexplain
your
motive
for
so
doing
,
as
well
as
for
summoning
me
hither
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
in
good
time
,
young
man
,
"
replied
Cordwell
Firebras
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
I
advert
to
my
own
concerns
,
let
me
say
a
word
on
yours
.
<EOS>
Answerme
truly
;
have
you
not
conceived
an
affection
for
Hilda
Scarve
?
<EOS>
Nay
,
youneed
not
answer
;
your
hesitation
convinces
me
you
have
so
.
<EOS>
Circumstancesled
you
into
acting
very
injudiciously
this
morning
at
the
Folly
,
and
,
Ifear
,
your
conduct
may
have
produced
an
unfavorable
impression
onHilda
's
mind
,
for
I
watched
her
closely
.
<EOS>
But
heed
not
this
.
<EOS>
I
will
setall
to
rights
.
<EOS>
I
have
much
influence
with
her
father
.
<EOS>
He
designs
her
foranother,--the
apish
gallant
of
the
pretty
actress
who
fascinated
youthis
morning
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
have
her
,
nevertheless,--on
one
condition
.
<EOS>
""Despite
<EOS>
the
singularity
of
your
address
,
there
is
an
earnestness
inyour
manner
that
inspires
me
with
confidence
in
you
,
sir
,
"
rejoinedRandulph
;
"
the
rather
,
that
you
told
me
this
morning
you
were
an
oldfriend
of
my
father
's
.
<EOS>
I
will
freely
confess
to
you
that
I
am
captivatedby
the
miser
's
daughter
,
and
that
I
would
hazard
much
to
obtain
her
.
<EOS>
Now
,
on
what
condition
do
you
propose
to
make
her
mine?""You
shall
learn
presently
,
"
replied
Firebras
,
evasively
.
<EOS>
"
Let
us
take
aturn
along
the
cloisters
,
"
he
added
,
moving
slowly
forward
.
<EOS>
They
marched
on
together
in
silence
,
until
they
reached
the
easternangle
of
the
ambulatory
,
when
Firebras
,
suddenly
halting
,
laid
his
handupon
Randulph
's
arm
,
and
fixing
a
searching
look
upon
him
,
said
,
"
Youngman
,
I
will
tell
you
what
you
must
do
to
gain
the
miser
's
daughter?""What
?
<EOS>
what
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"You
must
join
the
Jacobite
party
,
"
replied
Firebras
,
"
to
which
herfather
belongs
--
to
which
your
father
belonged
--
and
to
which
your
motheralso
belongs
.
<EOS>
"Surprize
kept
Randulph
silent
,
But
neither
he
nor
his
companion
wereaware
that
this
treasonable
speech
had
been
overheard
by
Peter
Pokerich
,
and
the
fair
Thomasine
,
who
having
stolen
upon

unperceived
,
wereensconced
behind

RETURN
--
<EOS>
THE
DISAPPEARANCEOF
THE
MORTGAGE
MONEY
--
EFFRONTERY
OF
PHILIP
FREWIN
<EOS>
AND
DIGGS.Day
wore
on
,
and
Mrs.
Clinton
,
who
began
to
wonder
at
her
niece'sprolonged
stay
,
became
extremely
apprehensive
lest
Mr.
Scarve
shouldreturn
before
her
,
and
discover
her
absence
.
<EOS>
She
had
just
despatched
herscanty
dinner
,
having
waited
more
than
an
hour
for
Hilda
,
removed
thethings
that
they
might
not
excite
the
miser
's
suspicion
,
in
case
of
hissudden
return
,
and
sat
down
to
her
needlework
,
on
which
she
wasdiligently
,
though
almost
mechanically
employed
,
when
she
was
startledby
a
sound
like
the
opening
of
a
window
,
followed
by
a
stealthy
tread
,
in
one
of
the
rooms
upstairs
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
robbers
instantly
occurred
toher
,
for
she
recollected
the
large
amount
of
gold
in
the
house
,
as
wellas
the
public
manner
in
which
it
had
been
paid
,
and
she
felt
how
likelyit
was
that
an
attempt
might
be
made
to
carry
it
off
,
especially
if
ithad
been
ascertained
that
she
was
alone
in
the
house
.
<EOS>
She
had
heard
ofmurders
committed
in
lone
habitations
,
in
broad
day
,
and
,
in
most
cases
,
upon
defenceless
females
like
herself
;
and
filled
with
indescribableterror
,
she
rushed
forth
with
the
intention
of
giving
the
alarm
.
<EOS>
Beforeshe
gained
the
passage
,
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
street
door
,
andhurrying
to
it
,
she
hastily
,
and
with
trembling
hands
,
unfastened
it
,
and
beheld
the
miser
.
<EOS>
If
she
was
startled
by
his
appearance
,
he
was
notless
so
by
her
at
and
fixing
a
terrible
look
upon
her
<EOS>
,
he
demanded
whyJacob
had
not
let
him
in
?
<EOS>
Receiving
no
answer
,
he
pushed
roughly
intothe
passage
,
and
clapping
the
door
hastily
to
,
proceeded
to
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Poor
Mrs.
Clinton
scarcely
knew
what
to
do
,
but
at
last
she
followedhim
,
and
found
him
pacing
to
and
fro
within
the
room
,
like
onedistracted
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
saw
her
,
he
ran
towards
her
,
and
seizing
herarm
,
cried
,
"
Where
is
Jacob
?
<EOS>
Is
the
rascal
gone
out
without
leave
?
<EOS>
Whydon't
<EOS>
you
speak
,
woman
?
<EOS>
Have
you
dared
to
send
him
out?--or
<EOS>
has
Hilda?""He
will
be
back
directly
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clinton
,
almost
frightened
outof
her
senses
.
<EOS>
"
I
expected
him
long
before
this
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
is
gone
out
,
"
cried
the
miser
,
as
if
he
could
scarcely
creditwhat
he
heard
;
"
and
Hilda
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
is
gone
with
him?"Mrs
.
<EOS>
Clinton
returned
a
terrified
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
where
are
they
gone
to
,
in
the
devil
's
name
?
<EOS>
"
roared
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
at
liberty
to
say
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
"I
will
have
an
answer
,
"
cried
the
miser
,
glaring
at
her
,
as
if
he
wouldannihilate
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
she
gone?""You
will
extort
nothing
from
me
by
this
violence
,
"
returned
Mrs
.
Clinton
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
you
shall
quit
my
house
to
-
night
,
"
he
rejoined
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"
I
willnot
have
my
authority
set
at
nought
.
<EOS>
Seek
another
home
,
madam

"The
<EOS>
poor
lady
hung
her
head
,
but
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
"Mrs

<EOS>
Clinton
,
"
he
continued
,
with
forced
calmness
,
"
I
put
it
toyourself,--and
unless
I
have
been
altogether
mistaken
in
you
,
<EOS>
you
willnot
be
insensible
to
the
appeal
--
I
put
it
to
you
to
say
,
whether
,
when
Idemand
,
as
a
father
,
to
know
what
has
become
of
my
daughter

you
canreconcile
it
to
your
conscience
to
refuse
to
tell
me?""I
will
tell
you
thus
much
,
sir

"
she
replied
,
after
a
pause
;
<EOS>
"
Hilda
hasbeen
induced
to
take
this
step
solely
in
consequence
of
your
declarationthat
you
would
compel
her
into
a
marriage
with
her
cousin

<EOS>
She
is
goneto
consult
a

<EOS>
""What
friend
?
"
cried
the
miser
,
springing
towards
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
insist
uponknowing
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
then
,
you
shall
know

sir

"
replied
Mrs.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
gone
tosee
Mr.
Abel
Beechcroft
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
a
heavy
blow
had
been
dealt
him
,
the
unhappy
man
could
not
have
beenmore
staggered
than
by
this
information
.
<EOS>
He
turned
away
in
confusion
,
muttering--"Abel
Beechcroft
!
<EOS>
Why
should
she
go
to
him?""Because
her
poor
mother
left
a
letter

render
it
necessary

replied
Mrs.

"And

you
gave

cried
the

"And
<EOS>
you
sent
her
to
her
father
's
bitterest
enemy
for
advice
?
<EOS>
"
hecontinued
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
well
!
<EOS>
It
is
well
!
"
<EOS>
And
he
strode
to
the
side
door
,
asif
with
the
intention
of
mounting
to
his
bed
-
room
.
<EOS>
Up
to
this
moment
,
Mrs.
Clinton
had
forgotten
the
circumstance
that
hadso
recently
alarmed
her
,
but
she
now
recalled
it
,
and
ran
after
him
,
crying
,
"
Sir
!
<EOS>
sir!""What
does
the
woman
want
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
miser
,
turning
fiercely
uponher
.
<EOS>
The
answer
stuck
in
her
throat
.
<EOS>
Dreading
to
provoke
a
fresh
explosion
ofrage
,
she
muttered
some
unintelligible
excuse
,
and
retired
.
<EOS>
The
miser
,
meanwhile
,
having
obtained
access
to
his
chamber
,
threw
hishat
upon
the
bed
,
passed
on
,
and
unlocked
the
door
of
the
closet
.
<EOS>
Marching
up
to
the
large
chest
in
which
he
had
deposited
the
bags
ofgold
on
the
previous
night
,
he
sat
down
upon
it
,
and
was
for
some
timelost
in
deep
and
painful
reflection
.
<EOS>
He
then
rose
,
and
taking
a
bunch
ofkeys
from
his
pocket
,
applied
one
of
them
to
the
lock
of
the
chest
.
<EOS>
Itwould
not
turn
,
and
imagining
he
must
have
made
some
mistake
,
he
drew
itout
,
and
tried
another
.
<EOS>
This
however
,
did
not
fit
at
all
,
and
returningto
the
first
,
he
perceived
on
examination
that
it
was
the
right
one
.
<EOS>
Onexamining
it
,
he
found
to
his
surprise
and
dismay
,
that
the
chest
wasnot
locked
.
<EOS>
Well
knowing
he
had
not
left
it
in
this
state
,
he
feltconvinced
that
something
was
wrong
,
and
it
was
long
before
he
couldprevail
upon
himself
to
raise
the
lid
.
<EOS>
When
he
did
so
,
he
fell
back
witha
cry
of
anguish
and
despair
.
<EOS>
The
chest
was
empty!For
<EOS>
some
minutes
,
he
remained
as
if
transfixed
,
with
his
hands
stretchedout
,
his
mouth
wide
open
,
his
eyes
almost
starting
from
their
sockets
,
and
fixed
upon
the
void
where
his
treasure
should
have
been
.
<EOS>
At
lengthhe
shrieked
,
in
accents
of
despair--"I
have
been
robbed
--
robbed
of
mygold
robbed
--
robbed
!
<EOS>
It
is
a
wicked
thing
a
cruel
thing
to
rob
me
.
<EOS>
Others
do
not
love
gold
as
I
love
it
.
<EOS>
I
love
it
better
than
wife
,
child
,
mistress
--
better
than
life
itself
.
<EOS>
Would
that
they
had
killed
me
ratherthan
take
my
gold
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
those
fair
shining
pieces
,
so
broad
,
so
bright
,
so
beautiful
!
<EOS>
what
can
have
become
of
them?"After
a
pause
,
during
which
he
experienced
the
acutest
mental
anguish
,
he
looked
around
to
see
how
the
robbery
could
have
been
effected
.
<EOS>
Amoment
's
examination
shewed
him
that
the
iron
bars
in
front
of
thelittle
window
opposite
the
chest
had
been
removed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
villains
musthave
found
entrance
there
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
rushing
towards
the
window
,
andclambering
upon
an
old
oaken
bureau
that
stood
near
it
,
he
pushed
itwide
open
,
and
stretching
his
long
scraggy
neck
through
it
,
gazed
intothe
little
garden
beneath
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
discover
anything
,
he
drew
back
from
the
window
,
and
castinghis
eyes
over
the
bureau
perceived
that
the
dust
with
which
it
wascovered
had
been
slightly
brushed
away
;
but
whether
by
himself
or
thedepredators
,
it
was
now
of
course
impossible
to
determine
.
<EOS>
A
bottlestanding
on
one
corner
of
the
bureau
had
not
been
removed
.
<EOS>
It
was
plain
,
however
,
that
admittance
had
been
gained
through
the
window
,
and
it
wasequally
clear
that
the
plunderers
had
gone
direct
to
the
chest
,
of
whichthey
must
have
possessed
a
key
,
for
the
lock
,
though
strained
,
had
notbeen
forced
.
<EOS>
Maddened
by
these
reflections
,
and
unable
to
account
forthe
occurrence
,
he
again
vented
his
fury
in
words.--"I
<EOS>
have
it
!
"
<EOS>
heshrieked--"it
is
that
accursed
Welch
baronet
who
has
robbed
me
.
<EOS>
He
paidme
the
money
in
this
public
way
only
to
delude
me
.
<EOS>
I
'll
charge
him
withthe
robbery
--
I'll
prove
it
against
him
--
I'll
hang
him
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
it
woulddelight
me
to
hang
him
.
<EOS>
I
would
give
a
thousand
pounds
to
see
it
done
.
<EOS>
Athousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
What
is
that
to
the
fourteen
thousand
I
have
lost
?
<EOS>
Ishall
go
mad
--
and
it
were
happy
for
me
that
I
should
do
so
.
<EOS>
PhilipFrewin
will
refuse
to
marry
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Her
portion
is
gone
--
gone
!
<EOS>
Whydid
I
go
forth
with
Firebras
?
<EOS>
I
ought
to
have
taken
my
seat
on
thatchest
--
to
have
eaten
my
meals
upon
it
--
to
have
slept
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Night
norday
should
I
have
quitted
it
.
<EOS>
Fool
that
I
have
been
<EOS>
--
I
have
been
rightlyserved
--
rightly
served
.
<EOS>
And
yet
it
is
hard
upon
me
--
an
old
man
to
loseall
I
held
<EOS>
dear
--
very
hard
!
"
<EOS>
And
falling
upon
his
knees
,
with
his
handsclasped
together
,
beside
the
vacant
chest
,
he
wept
aloud
.
<EOS>
This
paroxysm
of
rage
and
grief
having
subsided
,
he
again
arose
,
anddescended
to
the
parlour
,
where
he
found
Mrs.
Clinton
anxiously
waitinghis
re
-
appearance
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
divined
what
had
happened
,
andretreated
before
him
as
he
advanced
,
almost
fearing
from
his
looks
thathe
would
do
her
a
violence
.
<EOS>
Shaking
his
clenched
hand
,
and
foaming
atthe
mouth
,
he
attempted
to
discharge
a
volley
of
imprecations
againsther
,
but
rage
took
away
the
power
of
speech
,
and
he
stood
gesticulatingand
shaking
before
her
--
a
most
appalling
spectacle
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
Heaven
's
sake
,
sir
,
compose
yourself
,
"
she
cried
,
"
or
you
will
havea
fit
,
or
some
dangerous
illness
.
<EOS>
You
frighten
me
to
death
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
of
it
,
"
he
shrieked
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
been
robbed
--
the
mortgage
-
moneyis
gone
--
the
fourteen
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
D'ye
hear
,
woman
?
<EOS>
I
've
beenrobbed
,
I
say
--
robbed!""I
feared
as
much
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clinton
;
"
but
the
robbery
can
not
havebeen
long
effected
,
for
just
before
you
knocked
at
the
door
<EOS>
I
heard
awindow
creak
,
as
I
thought
in
your
room
.
<EOS>
""You
did
!
"
screamed
the
miser
.
"
<EOS>
And
why
not
tell
me
this
before
?
<EOS>
I
mighthave
caught
them
--
might
have
got
back
the
spoil
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
had
n't
frightened
me
so
much
about
Hilda
<EOS>
,
I
should
have
toldyou
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Clinton
,
in
a
deprecatory
tone
.
"
<EOS>
But
your
violenceput
it
out
of
my
head?"Hell
and
fiends
!
"
ejaculated
the
miser
;
"
what
is
Hilda
,
what
are
fiftydaughters
,
compared
with
my
gold
?
<EOS>
If
you
had
enabled
me
to
recover
it
,
Iwould
have
forgiven
you
all
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
stand
trembling
there
,
fool
,
but
come
with
me
,
and
let
us
see
whether
we
can
discover
any
traces
ofthe
robbers
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
hurried
towards
a
small
back
door
in
the
passage
,
thebolts
of
which
were
so
rusty
that
he
had
considerable
difficulty
inremoving
them
;
but
this
effected
,
he
passed
into
the
garden
,
<EOS>
A
mostmiserable
and
neglected
place
it
was
,
and
almost
wholly
overgrown
withlong
rank
grass
,
such
as
is
to
be
seen
in
some
city
churchyards
.
<EOS>
But
ithad
once
been
prettily
laid
out
,
as
was
evidenced
from
the
lines
of
boxbordering
the
flower
-
beds
,
as
well
as
from
the
trellised
arbour
andgreenhouse
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
the
latter
made
the
desolation
of
theplace
more
complete
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
.
<EOS>
The
glass
wasremoved
from
the
frames
--
one
of
the
walls
had
been
pulled
down
,
and
thebricks
and
plaster
were
lying
scattered
about
,
together
with
a
heap
ofbroken
flowerpots
,
and
a
number
of
worn
-
out
and
battered
gardeningimplements
.
<EOS>
The
arbour
was
covered
with
the
net
-
like
folds
of
a
deadcreeper
,
and
the
trellis
-
work
was
decayed
and
falling
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Thelittle
window
,
to
which
access
had
been
gained
by
the
robbers
,
was
onthe
upper
story
,
and
about
sixteen
feet
from
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
miser
gazedanxiously
and
inquiringly
at
it
.
<EOS>
All
the
lower
windows
,
including
thatof
the
parlour
,
which
he
usually
occupied
,
were
closely
barred
,
and
hadevidently
not
been
disturbed
.
<EOS>
Those
in
the
attics
were
boarded
up
;
whileof
the
remainder
in
the
first
floor
,
only
the
small
one
in
question
wasopen
.
<EOS>
On
examining
the
ground
beneath
it
,
he
found
foot
-
prints
upon
the
soiland
on
the
crushed
grass
,
and
,
as
far
as
he
could
ascertain
,
two
orthree
persons
must
have
assisted
at
the
robbery
.
<EOS>
He
traced
thefoot
-
prints
across
the
garden
to
a
wall
about
six
feet
high
,
at
the
backof
which
was
a
narrow
passage
,
communicating
between
the
adjoining
houseand
the
area
in
front
of
the
abbey
;
and
here
,
from
certain
indicationsin
the
soil
,
he
had
no
doubt
that
the
depredators
had
got
over
.
<EOS>
Hisvociferations
while
conducting
the
search
brought
some
of
the
inmates
ofthe
next
house
into
the
passage
,
and
they
told
him
that
they
had
seenand
heard
nothing
,
but
begged
him
to
come
round
and
satisfy
himself
.
<EOS>
This
he
instantly
did
,
and
found
their
representations
perfectlycorrect
.
<EOS>
The
only
proof
of
the
robbers
having
gained
admission
by
thisway
lay
in
the
fact
of
the
passage
-
door
being
left
open
.
<EOS>
Hisinvestigations
ended
,
the
miser
,
who
made
no
remark
while
conductingthem
,
went
back
to
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
To
his
surprise
,
he
found
that
his
daughter
and
Jacob
had
returned
.
<EOS>
Thelatter
looked
greatly
disconcerted
,
and
continued
twirling
his
hatbetween
his
fingers
,
but
Hilda
advanced
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
am
greatly
distressed
to
hear
of
your
loss
,
father
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
to
whom
am
I
to
attribute
it
?
"
<EOS>
he
rejoined
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
hadremained
at
home
,
and
Jacob
had
been
on
the
watch
,
it
would
not
havehappened
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
<EOS>
not
,
"
she
rejoined
;
"
but
I
am
not
wholly
to
blame
.
<EOS>
It
was
yourunkindness
that
compelled
me
to
take
this
step
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
and
what
does
good
Abel
Beechcroft
,
kind
Abel
Beechcroft
say?"cried
the
miser
tauntingly
;
"
what
does
he
advise?--will
<EOS>
he
receiveyou?--will
<EOS>
he
adopt
you?--will
he
give
you
to
his
nephew
Randulph
?
<EOS>
He
iswelcome
to
do
so
if
he
pleases
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
let
us
speak
on
this
subject
now
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Hilda--"youhave
too
much
upon
your
mind
without
it
.
<EOS>
I
pray
you
to
believe
that
Ihave
been
guilty
of
no
wilful
disobedience
towards
you
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
"
cried
the
miser
,
contemptuously--"I
will
not
have
my
patienceabused
by
idle
professions
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
you
say
,
we
will
discuss
the
matterat
another
time
.
<EOS>
Answer
me
only
one
question
--
have
you
seen
RandulphCrew?""I
have
,
"
replied
Hilda
,
blushing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
his
uncle
's
?
"
demanded
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
,
"
she
rejoined--"but
in
a
situation
and
under
circumstances
that
,
ifI
had
entertained
the
slightest
regard
for
him
,
would
have
effectuallyobliterated
it
.
<EOS>
""We
saw
your
nephew
at
the
same
time
,
sir
,
"
said
Jacob
,
who
had
nowregained
his
self
-
possession
.
"Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
miser--"where
<EOS>
did
you
see
him?""At
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
and
he
was
not
in
themiserable
dress
he
came
to
visit
you
in
,
but
in
a
fine
suit
and
handsomeperuke
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
he
was
playing
you
false
.
<EOS>
If
I
'm
not
deceived
,
also
,
he
was
on
good
terms
with
the
gay
lady
to
whom
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
waspaying
attention
,
and
which
made
Miss
Hilda
so
jealous!""Jacob
?
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
,
again
colouring
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
I
meant
no
offence
,
Miss
,
"
he
returned
;
"
but
you
know
it
's
thetruth
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
idle
story
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
miser
,
incredulously
.
<EOS>
Jacob
's
reply
was
cut
short
by
a
knock
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
at
home
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Yes
--
yes--
"
replied
the
miser
:
"
in
my
present
frame
of
mind
<EOS>
I
care
notwhom
<EOS>
I
see
.
<EOS>
"Jacob
then
departed
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
returned
,
with
a
countenancefraught
with
vexation
and
surprise
,
ushering
in
Diggs
and
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
The
latter
was
dressed
in
the
same
miserable
suit
,
the
same
old
wig
,
andthe
same
old
shoes
with
high
quarters
,
that
he
had
worn
on
the
precedingday
.
<EOS>
The
visitors
appeared
struck
with
the
embarrassed
air
of
the
miserand
his
family
,
and
Diggs
inquired
the
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
I
explain
what
has
happened
to
myself
,
Mr.
Diggs
,
"
said
Scarve,"I
think
it
right
to
state
that
my
servant
,
Jacob
Post
,
declares
he
sawmy
nephew
on
board
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
this
morning
,
and
verydifferently
dressed
from
what
he
is
at
present
.
<EOS>
""I
saw
him
not
two
hours
ago
,
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"That
must
have
been
at
half
-
past
two
o'clock
,
"
rejoined
Diggs
,
takingout
his
watch
,
"
and
at
that
time
he
was
with
me
.
<EOS>
You

bemistaken

<EOS>
""I
am
quite
at
a
loss
to
conceive
what
Jacob
can
mean
,
"
said
Philip,"but
I
certainly
was
with
Mr.
Diggs
at
the
time
specified

stated

<EOS>
""You

"Mr

Diggs
smiled
at

shrugged
his

"They're
<EOS>
in

together

said
Jacob
,
"
if
you

""I
certainly
thought
I

said
Hilda
,
"
<EOS>

I
confess
I
was

<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
I
ask
my

<EOS>
inquired
Philip
.
<EOS>
"Ay
<EOS>
,
you
may
well
ask
that

"
added
the
miser

<EOS>
"It
can
matter
little
why

replied
Hilda

<EOS>
""I

give
you
no

said
Scarve

I
havereceived

<EOS>
My

Jacob

""You

add,"she

,
looking
at

"Ay

you

pursued
Hilda

She

not

not
more
false

in
reality

<EOS>
What
will
beof
more
consequence

,
that

<EOS>
""It

Noone

cried
the

triumphantly

there

cried
the

I

mournfully--"it

""Without

The

<EOS>
""Pardon

returned
the

I
proposed

I

I

"Before

said
Hilda

I

turning

that
you
will
not
put
faith

inquire
among

among
those

know

well

as

how
I
stand

It
is
,
perhaps

useless

<EOS>
""Not

the

As

feel
called

I
can
do

proof

you

""The

if

easily
perceive

""Nephew

<EOS>
the

turned
a
deaf

exchanged
a

words

he
returned

the

vacant

<EOS>
Hilda
and
her
aunt
had
retiredto
their
own
room
,
and
Jacob
had
descended
to
the
cellar
to
get
out
ofthe
way
.
<EOS>
The
miser
mounted
to
the
ladies
'
room
,
and
seeing
the
key
inthe
door
,
turned
it
,
and
took
it
out
.
<EOS>
This
precaution
taken
,
he
sat
downin
his
chair
,
and
remained
for
nearly
two
hours
pondering
on
the
eventsof
the
day
.
<EOS>
He
was
still
wrapped
in
painful
meditations
,
when
a
loudknock
was
heard
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Before
an
answer
could
be
returned
,
thesummons
was
repeated
,
and
he
heard
Jacob
proceeding
along
thepassage
--
the
door
was
opened
--
footsteps
were
heard
approaching
--
and
,
ashe
raised
his
head
in
surprise
,
Lady
Brabazon
was
announced
.
<EOS>
It
is
quitecertain
,
that
if
Mr.
Scarve
had
been
consulted
he
would
have
refused
herladyship
admittance
.
<EOS>
But
as
it
was
not
now
in
his
power
to
deny
himself
,
he
rose
,
with
the
best
grace
he
could
,
to
receive
her
.
<EOS>
Jacob
received
anod
,
and
departed
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
said
Lady
Brabazon
,
"
I
am
come
to
know
whether
I

the
four
thousand
pounds
to

night

<EOS>
""Impossible

impossible

replied
the

<EOS>
"
If

twice
the

it

heavy

a

""Poh

LadyBrabazon

<EOS>
"
You

heavy

You
take
a
great

good

I
must
have
a
thousand
pounds

if
you

sheproduced
a
case
of
diamonds

<EOS>
"
You
see

she
added
,
displaying
them,"they
are
worth
nearly
double
the
amount

<EOS>
""They
are
very
brilliant

he
replied
,
gazing
at
them
with
the
eye
of
aconnoisseur

<EOS>
But
I
can
not
lend
your
ladyship
the
money

<EOS>
""Mr

<EOS>
Scarve

said
Lady
Brabazon
,
"
I
have
a
debt
to
pay
to

night

ifI
do
not
discharge
it

be
entirely
lost

<EOS>
""Your

scarcely
sufferby
the
delay

Scarve

drily
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
this
is
a

of
honour

said
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
"
I

of
honour

that
is
quite
another

"
These
are
certainly
a

Will
you
favour
me

Lady

condescendingly

which
to

miser
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
old
fool
has
fallen
in
love
with
me

"
thought
Lady
Brabazon
;
"
Imust

the
advantage

have
gained

<EOS>
You
are
very
complaisant

<EOS>
Mr

she
added
aloud
,
and
with
one
of
her
bewitching
smiles
--
a
smilewhich
,
in
her
younger
days
,
had
never
failed
of
execution

<EOS>
"It
would
be
strange
if
I
were
not

to
so
fascinating
a
person
as
yourladyship

replied
the
miser
,
with
a
strange
leer
,
that
sat
very
ill
onhis
withered
features

<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
cast
down
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"I
almost
forget

"
she
observed
,
after
a
slightpause
,
during
which
she
hoped
the

would
follow
up
his
gallantcommencement
.
<EOS>
"A
proof
<EOS>
it
can
not
be
of
great
importance

"
said
Scarve
;
"

yourladyship

asked

"
continued
the
miser
,
"
merely
for
consideration
.
<EOS>
Suppose
I
were
to
offer
myself
to
a
person
of
your
ladyship
's
rank
--
<EOS>
andin
your
ladyship
's
position
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
reception
<EOS>
should
I
be
likelyto
meet
with?""That
<EOS>
,
I
should
say
,
would
depend
entirely
upon
the
settlement
youproposed
to
make
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
replied
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
"
You
are
reportedto
be
immensely
rich
.
<EOS>
You
have
some
misunderstanding
with
your
daughter
,
you
say
,
which
I
can
readily
conceive
--
daughters
are
so
veryunmanageable
--
there
is
my
Clementina
,
for
instance
,
the
sweetest
temperin
the
world
,
but
she
gives
me
an
infinity
of
trouble:--but
,
as
I
wassaying
,
you
are
immensely
rich
--
money
is
no
object
to
you
;
if
,
therefore
,
you
were
to
settle
upon
a
lady
in
my
position
somewhere
abouta
hundred
thousand
pounds
--
but
not
less
--
I
think
--
<EOS>
mind
<EOS>
,
I
onlythink
--
<EOS>
for
I
offer
a
very
hasty
and
ill
-
considered
opinion
--
I
think
,
however
,
she
might
be
induced
to
accept
you
.
<EOS>
""Rather
a
large
sum
to
pay
for
a
wife
at
my
time
of
life
,
yourladyship
,
"
observed
the
miser
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
a
fraction
more
than
would
be
required
,
believe
me
,
my
good
sir,"replied
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
I
must
abandon
any
views
I
may
have
entertained
of
an
exaltedalliance
,
"
sighed
the
miser
.
"
<EOS>
But
suppose
we
take
another
view
of
thecase
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
for
a
hundredth
part
of
the
sum
,
there
would
be
nonecessity
for
marriage
at
all
.
<EOS>
""That
is
a
view
of
the
case
which
I
can
not
for
a
moment
contemplate
,
Mr
.
Scarve
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
with
a
glance
of
indignation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Allow
me
toremind
you
that
I
came
here
on
business
.
<EOS>
""True
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
in
some
confusion
;
"
these
diamonds
arecertainly
very
brilliant
.
<EOS>
Your
ladyship
shall
have
the
sum
you
requireupon
them
.
<EOS>
And
we
will
talk
about
the
other
matters
at
some
futuretime
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
unlocked
the
little
chest
beneath
the
table
,
and
producinga
small
tin
cash
-
box
,
opened
it
,
took
forth
a
rouleau
of
goldsmiths'notes
,
counted
them
,
and
delivered
them
to
her
ladyship
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazontwisted
the
notes
carelessly
between
her
fingers
,
and
then
placed
themin
her
bag
;
after
which
she
divested
herself
of
the
diamonds
,
gave
themto
the
miser
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
as
if
to
shew
she
was
not
offendedwith
him
beyond
the
hope
of
reconciliation
,
she
accorded
him
hersnow
-
white
hand
,
which
he
pressed
to
his
lips
.
<EOS>
This
ceremony
performed
,
he
ushered
her
to
the
street
door
,
where
her
carriage
was
waiting
,
andbowed
her
to
its
steps
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
's
,
"
said
Lady
Brabazon
,
to
her
servant
,
as
he
closed
thedoor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
odious
wretch
!
"
<EOS>
she
added
to
herself
,
"
to
make
such
aproposal
to
me
!
<EOS>
However
,
I
have
got
the
money
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
miser
returned
to
the
parlour
,
he
rubbed
his
skinny
handstogether
,
and
muttered
laughingly
to
himself---"So
she
affects
virtuousindignation
,
as
if
I
did
n't
know
she
only
wants
the
money
for
her
lover
,
Beau
Villiers
.
<EOS>
But
she
shall
be
mine
,
and
on
my
own
terms
too
.
<EOS>
She
iscertainly
a
fine
woman
--
a
very
fine
woman
.
<EOS>
What
do
you
want
,
sirrah
?
<EOS>
"
headded
,
raising
his
eyes
,
and
perceiving
Jacob
standing
before
him
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
you
mean
to
take
some
steps
about
this
robbery
?
"
asked
theporter
.
<EOS>
"What
's
that
to
you
,
rascal
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
the
miser
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
You
canwatch
the
stable
when
the
steed
's
stolen

can
you
?
<EOS>
Curse
on

<EOS>
You
shall
quit
my
service
in
a
week
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
I
wo

,
"
replied
Jacob
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
mornin
'
<EOS>
I
'd
have
quitted
youwith
pleasure
,
but
now
I
'm
sorry
for
you
--
you've
been
unfortunate
,
and
Iwont
go
.
<EOS>
""A
curse
on
your

"
cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
I
wo

be
plagued
with
you
anylonger

<EOS>
""You're
not
in
a
fit
condition
to
judge
for
yourself
just
now
,
"
returnedJacob
.
<EOS>
"
Think
it
over
about
discharging
me
when
you
are
calmer
.
<EOS>
I
amsorry
for
you
,
I
tell
you
--
that
is
,
I
'm
sorry
for
your
loss
,
though
Ihope
it
may
soften
your
obdurate
heart
towards
your
daughter

<EOS>
If
you
doturn
me
away
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
will
give
me
a
recommendation
to
Mr.
AbelBeechcroft
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
his
is
a
place
worth
livin
'
in
.
<EOS>
It
would
have
done
yougood
to
see
the
dinner
I
sat
down
to
to
-
day
with
the
servants
.
<EOS>
There
wasa
cold
sirline
o
'
beef
,
a
hot
potato
-
pie
,
a
piece
of
pickled
pork
,
andas
much
strong
ale
as
I
chose
to
drink
.
<EOS>
""Peace
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Scarve
<EOS>
;
"
what
satisfaction
can
it
be
to
me
<EOS>
tohear
how
a
profuse
gentleman
wastes
his
substance
on
a
set
of
thanklesshirelings?""They're
not
thankless
<EOS>
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
"
they
all
love
him
,
andspeak
well
of
him
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
is
their
opinion
worth
?
"
<EOS>
sneered
Scarve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Full
pockets
arebetter
than
the
empty
praises
of
a
set
of
idle
,
pampered
menials
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
think
so
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
and
I
only
wish
I
was
such
apampered
menial
as
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
'll
recommend
you
to
Mr.
Beechcroft
,
with
all
my
heart,"rejoined
Scarve
;
"
and
I
wish
he
may
take
you
,
for
I
could
n't
do
him
<EOS>
aworse
turn

<EOS>
You
'll
soon
eat
him
out
of
house
and
home
.
<EOS>
But
come
with
meto
my
room
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
led
the
way
upstairs
,
<EOS>
pointed
to
the
open
window
and
theempty
chest
,
and
asked
Jacob
,
with
a
bitter
sneer
,
"
whether
he
couldmake
anything
of
them?"Jacob
gazed
curiously
at
the
window
for
some
time
without
offering
aremark
,
and
then
proceeded
to
examine
the
chamber
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
,
his
eyealighted
upon
a
small
piece
of
paper
,
which
he
instantly
picked
up
.
<EOS>
Afew
lines
were
traced
upon
it
in
pencil
,
but
before
he
could
ascertaintheir
import
,
the
paper
was
snatched
from
him
by
his
master
,
who
read
asfollows:--"It
must
be
done
this
morning
.
<EOS>
The
money
is
in
a
chest
in
thedressing
-
room
,
which
is
accessible
from
the
little
garden
at
the
back
ofthe
house
.
<EOS>
You
can
reach
this
by
a
small
entry
opening
upon
the
area
infront
of
the
abbey
.
<EOS>
A
rope
ladder
will
do
the
rest
.
<EOS>
Alarm
no
one
if
youcan
help
it
;
and
above
all
,
let
no
violence
be
used
.
<EOS>
If
you
arediscovered
,
I
will
take
care
no
harm
befals
you
.
"
<EOS>
No
signature
wasattached
to
this
mysterious
document
,
neither
was
it
directed
.
<EOS>
The
upperpart
of
it
had
likewise
been
torn
off
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
had
better
let
me
take
that
letter
to
Tom
Blee
,
the
thief
-
taker,"said
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
He
'll
make
something
of
it
,
I
'll
warrant
him
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
who
remained
gazing
upon
the
paper
,
apparentlywrapped
in
thought
;
"
I
shall
stir
no
further
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
if
I
was
disposed
to
turn
house
-
breaker
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
"
<EOS>
you'rejust
<EOS>
the
person
I
should
like
to
begin
with
<EOS>
;
I
should
feel
sure
ofgettin
'
off
easy
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
raised
his
eyes
,
and
fixing
them
sternly
on
him
,
remarked--"Take
care
what
you
say
,
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Many
a
man
has
been
hanged
forlighter
words
than
you
have
just
uttered
.
<EOS>
"He
then
pointed
to
the
door
,
and
Jacob
withdrew
.
<EOS>
After
remaining
byhimself
nearly
an
hour
,
he
prepared
to
go
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
hisdaughter
's
chamber
,
he
heard
the
sound
of
her
voice
in
conversation
withher
aunt
,
and
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
to
see
that
the
key
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Repairing
to
the
parlour
,
he
called
to
Jacob
to
bring
him
something
toeat
.
<EOS>
A
little
cold
meat
and
bread
were
placed
before
him
by
the
porter
,
of
which
he
partook
very
sparingly
,
although
he
had
eaten
nothing
sincethe
morning
,
and
his
thirst
was
quenched
with
a
glass
of
water
.
<EOS>
Theeatables
removed
,
he
took
out
his
account
-
book
,
and
some
other
papers
,
and
began
to
occupy
himself
with
them
.
<EOS>
About
eight
o'clock
,
anotherknock
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
Jacob
came
to
tell
him
Mr.
CordwellFirebras
was
without
,
having
come
by
appointment
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"Admit
<EOS>
him
!
<EOS>
"
replied
the
miser
.
<EOS>
Thus
empowered
,
Jacob
departed
,
and
presently
afterwards
returned
withthe
individual
in
question
.
<EOS>
"I
am
punctual
,
you
see
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
said
Mr.
Firebras
,
with
a
smile
,
as
he
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"You
are
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
And
while
his
visitor
threwhimself
into
a
chair
,
he
ascertained
that
Jacob
descended
into
thecellar
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
said
Firebras
,
"
let
us
proceed
at
once
tobusiness
.
<EOS>
I
conclude
you
have
got
the
five
thousand
pounds
for
me
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
shook
his
head
,
and
proceeded
to
detail
the
robbery
that
hadbeen
committed
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Firebras
heard
the
narrative
with
a
smile
ofincredulity
.
<EOS>
"This
story
may
do
very
well
for
some
persons
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
he
said
,
atits
close
,
"
but
I
am
too
old
a
hand
to
be
duped
by
it
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
doubt
my
assertion
,
sir
,
"
cried
the
miser
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
quarrel
with
you
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
replied
the
other
,
withprovoking
calmness
;
"
I
have
too
many
public
disputes
on
hand
to
engagein
private
ones,--especially
on
my
own
account
.
<EOS>
I
consider
yourstatement
as
an
excuse
--
and
I
must
say
,
a
poor
one
;
that
is
all
.
<EOS>
You
hadbetter
say
at
once
,
and
frankly
,
that
you
have
changed
your
mind
,
andwill
not
advance
the
money
.
<EOS>
""I
have
already
explained
the
cause
of
my
inability
to
do
so
,
"
rejoinedthe
miser
,
with
stern
significance
;
"
and
it
must
suffice
.
<EOS>
""Well
<EOS>
sir
,
"
cried
Firebras
,
"
you
have
grievously
disappointed
me
--
andyou
will
disappoint
others
as
well
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
if
the
cause
prospers
,
you
will
have
a
hundred
per
cent
,
for
your
money
--
and
you
profess
towish
it
<EOS>
well
,
I
must
have
a
thousand
pounds
tonight
.
<EOS>
""That
<EOS>
I
may
possibly
manage
,
"
rejoined
Scarve
;
"
but
I
can
not
give
it
youin
gold
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
has
just
deposited
her
jewels
with
me
for
thatamount

<EOS>
""So
you
can
lend
her

money

returnedFirebras
,
reproachfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
admiration
of
the
fair
sex
is
greaterthan
your
devotion
to
the
good

<EOS>
But
let
me
have
the
jewels

<EOS>
may
not
be!""Here
they
are

replied
Scarve
,
producing
the
case
;
"
you
must
give
me
areceipt
for
them

<EOS>
""Willingly
,
"
said
Firebras
,
taking
up
a
pen
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
put
them
down
as
athousand
pounds
in
money

<EOS>
""You
must
put
them
down
as
fifteen
hundred

"
cried
the
miser
,
hastily--"I
am
not
to
run
all
this
risk
for
nothing

<EOS>
""Extortioner
!
"
exclaimed
Firebras
,
between
his
teeth
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
it
shallbe
as
you
will

<EOS>
King
James
the
Third

<EOS>
There
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
very
strange
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
the
miser
,
as
he
took
the
memorandum
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
writing
is
exactly
like
that
of
a
letter
I
found
in
my
closet
justnow
,
and
which
was
evidently
dropped
by
one
of
the
robbers
.
<EOS>
""A
letter
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Firebras
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Have
you
got
it
?
<EOS>
Let
me
lookat
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
produced
the
scrap
of
paper
,
and
placed
the
memorandum
besideit
.
<EOS>
The
handwriting
in
both
cases
was
precisely
the
same
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
handwriting
is
rather
like
mine
,
undoubtedly
,
"
said
Firebras
,
withthe
most
perfect
composure
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
you
mean
to
say
this
paper
was
foundin
the
room
where
the
robbery
was
committed?""It
<EOS>
was
found
there
by
Jacob

rejoined
the
miser

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
call
him
toadd
his
testimony
to
mine?""Oh
,
by
no

!
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
as
I
may
beconsidered
as
the
indirect
means
of
your
losing
this
money
,
I
will
takecare
,
if
the
good
cause
prospers
,
that
the
amount
is
made
up
to
you

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
had
better
confess
at
once
that
you
caused
it
to
be
taken

saidthe
miser

<EOS>
"You
are
resolved
I
shall
criminate
myself

"
replied
Firebras
,
laughing--"but
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubt
it
is
in
good
hands

<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
am
satisfied

Scarve

"

In

Give

Nay

"Firebras

smiled

and
complied

Mr.

smiled
too
,
as
he
comparedthe

And
thiswas
all

""What

cried

eagerly

"Not

on

bent

Tothill

.
<EOS>
He
was
laughing
to
himself
,
probably
at
what
hadjust
occurred
,
when
hearing
quick
footsteps
behind
him
,
he
turned
,
andbeheld
Mr.
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
.
<EOS>
The
valet
's
looks
so
much
alarmed
himthat
he
instantly
stopped
,
and
inquired
what
was
the
matter
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
lud
!
<EOS>
I
'm
quite
out
of
breath
,
"
gasped
Mr.
Cripps
,
putting
one
handaffectedly
to
his
side
,
while
with
the
other
he
held
a
scentedhandkerchief
to
his
nose
.
<EOS>
"Speak
<EOS>
,

,
and
do
n't
keep
me
in

"
<EOS>
cried
Firebras--"what'sthe

I
say?""Danger

a

<EOS>
death
on

is
the

replied
Mr

<EOS>
"
You

Mr.

what

?
<EOS>
"
demanded
the
other
,
uneasily
.
<EOS>
"Your
conversation
with
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
in
the
cloisters
yonder
,
wasoverheard
,
"
returned
Mr.
Cripps--"yes
<EOS>
,
you
may
well
start
,
sir

<EOS>
Irepeat
,
it
was
overheard
by
Peter
Pokerich
,
the
barber
,
and
,
hissweetheart
,
Thomasine
Deacle
,
the
mercer
's
fair
daughter
.
<EOS>
The
littlefellow
was
planning
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
discovery
,
whenfortunately
I
chanced
to
call
upon
him
,
and
with
great
ingenuity
--
thoughI
say
it
--
contrived
to
throw
dust
in
his
eyes
,
as
he
has
done
into
thoseof
so
many
of
his
customers
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""This
is
awkward
,
"
said
Firebras
,
thoughtfully
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Will
Pokerich
join
us
,
think
you?--and
if
so
,
can
he
be
trusted?""Hum
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Cripps
,
throwing
himself
into
a
musing
posture,"that
requires
consideration
.
<EOS>
I
think
I
might
manage
him
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
bepaid
for
the
service
,
Mr.
Firebras,--well
paid
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""Unquestionably
,
"
returned
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Prove
yourself
useful
,
and
youshall
never
find
me
ungrateful
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
there
's
the
fair
Thomasine
,
"
pursued
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
she
must
besilenced
,
too
.
<EOS>
Egad
,
I
'll
make
love
to
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
be
paid
for
thatlikewise
.
<EOS>
""Surely
the
lady
will
be
reward
enough
,
"
laughed
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
the
contrary
,
I
shall
have
her
on
my
hands
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
wo
nt
demand
more
than
my
due
,
sir--'pon

!
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
offeryou
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
go
back
to
the
barber
,
and
,
whenmatters
are
settled
,
you
may
expect
me
at
the
Rose
and
Crown
.
<EOS>
"
Andraising
his
hat
,
and
making
a
profound
bow
,
he
strutted
off
.
<EOS>
Ruminating
on
the
intelligence
he
had
received
,
Cordwell
Firebrasproceeded
to
Petty
France
,
where
he
struck
off
on
the
right
intoGardiner's
-
street
,
and
entered
the
Rose
and
Crown
.
<EOS>
Nodding
familiarly
tothe
landlord
,
who
came
from
the
bar
to
meet
him
,
he
marched
on
towards
aback
room
,
where
Randulph
was
seated
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
to
have
quitted
you
so
long
,
my
dear
young
friend
,
"
<EOS>
he
said;"but
<EOS>
I
have
been
detained
by
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
""Have
<EOS>
you
seen
Hilda
?
"
asked
the
young
man
.
<EOS>
"No
,
"
replied
Firebras
;
"
but
I
intimated
to
her
father
that
I
had
a
goodmatch
in
view
for
her
,
and
that
I
should
speak
to
him
on
the
subjectto
-
morrow
.
"Further
<EOS>
conversation
was
interrupted
by
the
landlord
,
who
ushered
in
SirBulkeley
Price
.
<EOS>
The
Welsh
baronet
hurried
forward
,
holding
out
both
hishands
towards
Firebras
;
but
he
started
,
and
looked
exceedingly
surprisedon
beholding
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
need
not
present
my
young
friend
,
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
to
you
,
SirBulkeley
,
"
said
Firebras
;
"
for
I
believe
--
nay
,
indeed
,
I
know
<EOS>
--
you
arealready
acquainted
with
him
.
<EOS>
""I
have
passed
a
great
part
of
the
morning
with
Mr.
Crew
,
"
said
SirBulkeley
,
bowing
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
was
not
aware
he
belonged
to
our
party
.
<EOS>
I
amextremely
glad
to
find
it
is
so
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
Randulph
could
reply
,
the
door
again
opened
,
and
a
gaunt
,
tallpersonage
entered
the
room
,
who
was
announced
by
the
host
as
Sir
NorfolkSalusbury
.
<EOS>
Never
had
Randulph
seen
so
extraordinary
a
figure
as
was
nowpresented
to
his
gaze
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
was
more
than
six
feet
high
,
with
avery
meagre
,
but
withal
muscular
-
looking
frame
,
and
large
,
prominentfeatures
.
<EOS>
He
held
himself
so
exceedingly
erect
,
that
he
seemed
inconsiderable
danger
of
falling
backwards
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
acinnamon
-
coloured
coat
of
rather
antiquated
fashion
,
a
scarlet
waistcoatedged
with
gold
,
black
velvet
breeches
,
and
white
silk
hose
.
<EOS>
He
hadlarge
lace
ruffles
at
his
wrists
,
and
a
flowing
lace
frill
at
hisbreast
.
<EOS>
His
well
-
powdered
peruke
was
terminated
by
a
long
thick
cue
,
which
,
as
it
hung
perpendicularly
down
,
showed
how
much
the
small
of
hisback
was
taken
in
.
<EOS>
His
features
,
which
were
rather
harsh
,
were
asinflexible
and
rigid
as
if
carved
in
mahogany
.
<EOS>
He
seemed
utterly
unableto
smile
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
grey
and
cat
-
like
,
and
surmounted
by
black
bushybrows
.
<EOS>
Rut
<EOS>
it
was
not
so
much
his
dress
,
his
features
,
or
his
figure
,
that
attracted
attention
:
it
was
his
extraordinary
formal
deportment
.
<EOS>
NoSpanish
hidalgo
ever
moved
with
greater
solemnity
and
dignity
:
<EOS>
his
limbscreaked
like
rusty
hinges
;
and
there
was
something
in
his
whole
air
andmanner
that
irresistibly
reminded
Randulph
of
Don
Quixote
.
<EOS>
"Welcome
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
said
Cordwell
Firebras
,
advancing
towards
him;"allow
me
to
present
my
young
friend
,
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
to
you
.
<EOS>
""I
am
happy
in
the
acquaintance
of
the
representative
of
so
ancient
aname
,
"
returned
Sir
Norfolk
,
bowing
stiffly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Eum
cognoscere
gaudeo
.
<EOS>
SirBulkeley
Price
,
I
salute
you
.
<EOS>
It
did
not
enter
into
my
expectations
tomeet
you
.
<EOS>
I
conceived
you
were
still
montivagous
and
eremitical
in
theprincipality
.
<EOS>
""I
arrived
yesterday
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
said
Sir
Bulkeley
,
advancing
towardshim
,
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
.
<EOS>
"
How
long
have
you
been
in
town?""My
sojourn
in
the
capital
hath
not
as
yet
exceeded
the
septimanallimit
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
plain
English
,
you
have
not
been
here
more
than
a
week
,
"
laughed
SirBulkeley
;
"
but
I
am
as
much
surprised
to
see
you
as
you
can
be
to
seeme
.
<EOS>
""My
advent
was
inopinate
and
repent
,
Sir
Bulkeley
,
"
rejoined
SirNorfolk
.
<EOS>
"
Affairs
of
State
drew
me
hither
.
<EOS>
"Again
<EOS>
the
door
opened
,
and
two
grave
-
looking
personages
,
announced
asFather
Verselyn
and
Mr.
Travers
were
ushered
in
by
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
FatherVerselyn
,
the
foremost
of
these
,
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
middle
-
aged
man
,
witha
dark
complexion
,
and
a
sinister
and
perfidious
expression
ofcountenance
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
like
a
layman
--
indeed
,
it
would
not
havebeen
safe
to
appear
in
any
priestly
dress
--
in
a
sober
-
coloured
suit
,
afull
-
bottomed
black
wig
,
which
he
wore
without
powder
,
and
spectacles
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Travers
was
a
short
,
square
-
built
person
,
with
a
broad
face
,
and
asearching
,
severe
look
.
<EOS>
He
was
likewise
very
plainly
attired
,
but
hadnevertheless
the
appearance
of
a
person
of
condition
.
<EOS>
Courteousgreetings
were
interchanged
between
the
new
comers
and
the
others
;
andRandulph
was
secretly
entertained
by
the
formality
with
which
SirNorfolk
returned
their
salutations
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
in
turn
,
introduced
to
thestrangers
,
but
could
scarcely
control
the
dislike
with
which
FatherVerselyn
,
inspired
him
.
<EOS>
The
party
then
broke
up
into
little
groups
,
andmuch
whispered
conversation
ensued
,
in
which
Randulph
took
no
part
.
<EOS>
Inabout
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
the
landlord
entered
the
room
,
and
,
bowingto
the
company
,
<EOS>
said
,
"
I
believe
,
gentlemen
,
you
are
all
assembled
.
<EOS>
Theroom
upstairs
is
ready
,
if
you
are
disposed
to
adjourn
to
it
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
proposition
being
assented
to
<EOS>
,
the
landlord
threw
open
the
door
,
anda
slight
contest
occurred
between
the
two
baronets
,
as
to
which
shouldoffer
the
other
precedence
.
<EOS>
"I
prae
,
Sir
Bulkeley
,
"
said
Sir
Norfolk
;
"
I
will
scale
the
staircaseafter
you
.
<EOS>
"Thus
<EOS>
exhorted
,
Sir
Bulkeley
,
who
thought
it
good
breeding
not
to
disputea
point
of
needless
ceremony
,
went
on
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
marched
after
himwith
majestic
steps
,
and
the
rest
of
the
party
followed
.
<EOS>
The
landlordushered
them
into
a
large
room
,
lighted
by
a
chandelier
suspended
fromthe
ceiling
.
<EOS>
In
the
centre
of
the
apartment
was
a
circular
table
coveredwith
bottles
and
glasses
.
<EOS>
Having
hung
up
their
hats
against
the
wall
,
the
company
sat
down
to
the
table
,
and
a
few
bumpers
went
briskly
round
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
carousing
,
a
tap
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
thelandlord
,
opening
a
reconnoitring
hole
within
it
,
spoke
to
some
onewithout
.
<EOS>
He
next
proceeded
to
convey
the
information
he
had
received
,
ina
low
tone
,
to
Cordwell
Firebras
,
who
immediately
said
aloud,--"Oh
,
yes
,
admit
him
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
a
new
brother!"The
door
was
then
opened
,
and
Randulph
recognised
,
in
the
gaily
-
attired
,
self
-
possessed
coxcomb
who
was
admitted
,
Mr.
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
a
glass
of
wine
,
Mr.
Cripps
,
"
said
Firebras
,
filling
a
bumper
,
andhanding
it
to
the
new
comer
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
Beau
Villiers
's
chief
valet
,
"
headded
,
in
an
under
tone
,
to
Sir
Norfolk
,
who
had
made
a
polite
,
thoughformal
bow
to
the
stranger
.
<EOS>
"What
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Norfolk
,
almost
shuddering
at
the
inadvertence
ofwhich
he
had
been
guilty
;
"
a
waiting
-
man
in
such
costly
and
nitidattire
.
<EOS>
Why
his
master
,
the
Petronius
Arbiter
of
the
day
,
can
scarcelybe
more
studiously
refined
in
the
taste
and
style
of
the
vestmentswherewith
he
decorates
his
person
.
<EOS>
""He
is
not
a
whit
so
,
"
laughed
Firebras
,
"
<EOS>
The
only
difference
betweenthem
is
,
that
Beau
Cripps
wears
in
May
the
coat
that
Beau
Villiers
hasworn
in
April
.
""Mehercle

"
exclaimed
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
prodigality
almost
exceedethbelief

<EOS>
""Landlord
,
it
is
time

"
<EOS>
cried
Father
Verselyn
,
who
performed
the
part
ofchairman
,
and
occupied
the
principal
seat
.
<EOS>
"I
am
ready
,
your
reverence
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
And
he
forthwithproceeded
to
a
cupboard
from
which
he
produced
a
large
china
bowl
,
apparently
filled
with
punch
,
which
he
placed
with
great
care
andsolemnity
in
the
centre
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
it
is
water
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Randulph
,
gazing
at
the
clear
lymph
,
withwhich
,
on
nearer
inspection
,
he
perceived
the
bowl
was
filled
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
be
sure
,
"
said
Firebras
,
"
and
we
are
about
to
drink
the
king'shealth

over

water

<EOS>
And
now
,
gentlemen

"
he
continued
,
fillingRandulph
's
glass
and
his
own--"fill

I
pray
you

to

<EOS>
""I

filled

"
said
Sir
Norfolk
,
rising
and
holding
up
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
,
"
cried
Sir
Bulkeley
,
likewise
rising
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I

"
said
the
landlord
,
who
stood
next
to
the
last
named
baronet
,
and
was
allowed
to
join
in
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I

"
chimed
Mr.
Travers
and
the
valet

<EOS>
"Then

said
Verselyn
,
addressing
Firebras

<EOS>
"With

pleasure

replied
Cordwell

And
he
held

over

bowl

while
his
example
was
imitated
by

added
,
turning
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
stretch
forth
your
arm
over
the
scyphus
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Norfolk
,
pointing
to
the
bowl
.
<EOS>
"You
must
drink
the
toast
,
it
's
the
rule
of

Club

"
added
SirBulkeley
.
<EOS>
"It
is
a
rule
I
can
not
subscribe
to

"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Am
<EOS>
I
mistaken
in
you
,
young
man
?
"
said
Firebras
,
regarding
himmenacingly
.
<EOS>
"Do
as
they
bid
you

or
you
'll
have
your

Mr.

,
popping
his
head
over
Firebras
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
drink
the
toast
,
or
not
?
"
demanded
Firebras
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
not
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
treasonable
,
and
I
refuseit
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
's
bold
declaration
had
well

cost

<EOS>
down
with

'
<EOS>
resounded
on
all
sides
;
thelandlord
rushed
to
the
door
,
and
placed
his
back
against
it
,
to
preventany
attempt
at
egress
in
that
way
;
while
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
pluckinghis
long
blade
from
its
sheath
,
and
making
it
whistle
over
his
head
,
kicked
a
chair
that
stood
between
him
and
the
young
man
out
of
the
way
,
and
bade
him
,
in
a
stern
tone
,
defend
himself
.
<EOS>
The
confusion
wasincreased
by
the
vociferations
of
Mr.
Cripps
,
and
by
an
accident
causedby
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
who
,
in
hurrying
round
the
table
,
contrived
toentangle
himself
in
the
cover
,
and
dragging
it
off
,
precipitated
thebottles
and
glasses
to
the
ground
,
drenching
the
lower
limbs
of
hisbrother
baronet
in
the
contents
of
the
fractured
bowl
.
<EOS>
The
only
twopersons
apparently
unmoved
in
the
midst
of
this
uproar
<EOS>
were
its
authorand
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
The
latter
made
no
hostile
display
,
and
did
noteven
alter
his
position
,
but
kept
his
eye
steadily
fixed
upon
Randulph
,
as
if
anxious
to
observe
the
effect
of
the
incident
upon
him
.
<EOS>
The
youngman
maintained
his
firmness
throughout
.
<EOS>
He
retreated
a
few
steps
towardsthe
wall
,
and
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defence
.
<EOS>
The
nearest
of
hisantagonists
was
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
;
but
seeing
the
others
pressforward
,
the
chivalrous
Welsh
baronet
declined
commencing
the
attack
.
<EOS>
"Singulatim!--one
at
a
time
,
Mr.
Travers
,
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ne

<EOS>
It
shall
never
be
said
that
any
man
,
however
unworthy

fought
against

in
the
presence

<EOS>
Stand
aside
,
therefore
,
sir,--and
you

leave
him

I
must
relinquish
the
right

I
have
in

acquired

""Let

the

alive

rejoined
Travers
.
<EOS>
"Trust

trust
him

"
<EOS>
cried
Father
Verselyn
:
"
his

<EOS>
I
will
absolve

<EOS>
The
imminence
of

justifies
the

<EOS>
""Proh

<EOS>
"
cried
Sir
Norfolk
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
That
would

neither

I
stand

it
done

<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I

"
cried
Sir
Bulkeley
,
who
had
by
this
time
recovered
from
theembarrassment
occasioned
by
the
accident
.
<EOS>
"
I
disapprove
of
FatherVerselyn
's
counsel
entirely

<EOS>
Let
us
hear
what
the
young

has

<EOS>
I
will
question
him

<EOS>
""Haudquaquam

replied
the
other
,
gravely
.
<EOS>

I

this

""Fight

rejoined
Sir

,
angrily
;

you
shall
notprevent
<EOS>
my
speaking
to

<EOS>
""Sir

returned
Sir

,
raising
his
crane
neck
toits
utmost
height
,
"
I
pray
you
not
to
interfere
between
me
and
Mr.

Sir

cried
the
other
,
his
hot
Welsh

to

empurpling
them
more
deeply
than

"What
<EOS>
then
,
Sir

shall
be
compelled
to
make
you
render
me
reason

replied
theother
sternly
.
<EOS>
Cordwell
Firebras
now
thought
it
time
to
interfere
.
<EOS>
"Gentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
advancing
towards
them
,
"
we
have
plenty
of
otherquarrels

settle

<EOS>
I
brought
Mr

will
be

""What

the

Sir

<EOS>
"
If

taciturnity

I
will
take
it

<EOS>
""So

I

added
Sir
Bulkeley

<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
thank
you
for
your
good
opinion

returned
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
have
been
,
almost
unwittingly
,
a
party
to
your
counsels

and
oughtperhaps
to
have
declared
my

sooner

<EOS>
But
I
hoped
the

pass
off
without
rendering
any
such
avowal
necessary

in

,
though
I
certainly
should
never

thesecret

<EOS>
it

,
if
I
am
suffered

<EOS>
I
could
not
avoid
expressing
mydisapproval
of
a
toast
which
,
in
common
with
every
loyal
subject
of
KingGeorge
the
Second
,
I
hold
to
be
treasonable
.
<EOS>
""You
can
not
be
the
subject
of
a
usurper
,
young
man
,
"
said
Firebras:"your
allegiance
to
King

the

is
unalienable

<EOS>
""Compel
him

vow
allegiance

Father

.
<EOS>
"I
will
sooner
lay
down
my
life
than
comply

"
cried
Randulph
,
resolutely
.
<EOS>
Firebras
looked
slightly
disconcerted
;
and
Sir
Norfolk
,
who
had
loweredthe
point
of
his
sword
,
again
raised
it
.
<EOS>
"It
is
in
vain
to
reason
with
him

my
son

"
whispered
Verselyn
.
"
<EOS>
Oursafety
demands
his
destruction

<EOS>
If
he
goes
hence
,
we
are
denounced
;

irreparable
injury
will
be
done
to
the
good

<EOS>
""I
have
promised
him
safe
conduct

"
rejoined
Firebras
;
"
and
,
atall
risks
,
I
will
keep
my
word

<EOS>
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
you
are
at

<EOS>
You
give
up
all

<EOS>
he
added
,
in
adeep
whisper
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
must
,
if
she
is
only
to
be
purchased
in
this

,
"
replied
Randulph
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"Take
time
to
consider
of
it
,
"
rejoined
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
find
means
ofcommunicating
with
you
to

<EOS>
Landlord
,
attend
Mr.

to

.
<EOS>
""You
are
wrong
in
letting
him
go

"
cried
Verselyn
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
repent
thisblind
confidence
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
,
I
entreat
you
to
interfere
--
Sir
Bulkeley
,
I
appeal
to
you
.
"But
<EOS>
they
both
turned
from
him
,
and
sheathed
their
swords
;
while
thelandlord
,
having
received
a
sign
from
Firebras
,
obeyed
his
instructions
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Randulph
was
gone
,
Firebras
addressed
himself
to
the
twobaronets:--"I
hope
no
unkindly
feeling
--
none
at
least
,
that
cannoteasily
be
set
to
rights,--subsists
between
you

"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
never
quarrel
with
my
good
friend
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
except
about
amatter
of
punctilio
,
"
replied
Sir
Bulkeley
,
who
was
as
easily
appeasedas
roused
to
anger
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
ought
never
to
quarrel
with
one
who
knows
how
to
make
so
handsomea
concession
as
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
,
with
agracious
bow
.
<EOS>
"Then
the
storm
has
blown
over
,
"
laughed
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
I
feared
this
morethan
the
other
.
<EOS>
"A
long
discussion
then
took
place
among
the
members
of
the
club
as
toRandulph
's
introduction
to
it
,
and
Firebras
was
severely
censured
byFather
Verselyn
,
for
admitting
the
young
man
,
without
testing
hispolitical
principles
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
not
repent
what
I
have
done
,
father
<EOS>
,
"
returned
Firebras
,
"
becauseI
am
satisfied
no
harm
will
come
of
it
;
and
it
was
an
attempt
to
gain
avery
useful
ally
to
our
cause
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
brave
lad
,
as
his
firmness
duringthis
affair
proved
,
and
it
would
be
a
great
point
to
win
him
over
.
<EOS>
Nordo
I
yet
despair
of
doing
so
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
we
have
seen
the
last
of
him
,
"
muttered
Verselyn
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
beg
<EOS>
itmay
be
borne
in
mind
that
it
was
against
my
advice
that
he
was
sufferedto
depart

"Cordwell
<EOS>
Firebras
darted
an
angry
look
at
the

the

arrived

found
them
still
in
deep
debate

when
a
quick
andcontinuous
knocking
was
heard
at
the
door

<EOS>
All
instantly
started
to
their
feet
,
gazing
at
each
other
in
alarm
.
<EOS>
"We
are
betrayed

said
Firebras
,
in
a
deep
whisper

<EOS>
"We
are

Father

by
the
spy
you
introduced

<EOS>
""It

false

<EOS>
cried
Firebras
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
But
this
is
no
time
fordispute
.
<EOS>
We
must
provide
for
our
safety

<EOS>
Who
is
it
,
landlord
?
"
<EOS>
he
criedto
the
host
,
who
,
on
the
first
alarm
,
had
rushed
to
the
door
,
and
openedthe
reconnoitring
-
hole
within
it
.
<EOS>
"O
lord
!
<EOS>
we
're
all
lost
!
"
rejoined
the
landlord
,
closing
the
trap
-
door
,
and
returning
to
them
with
scared
looks
and
on
tiptoe
,
as
if
afraid
ofthe
sound
of
his
own
footsteps
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
is
it
--
<EOS>
what
is
it
?
"
demanded
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"A
dozen
grenadier
guards
,
headed
by
their
captain
and
lieutenant
,
cometo
search
the
house
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
They
're
mounting
the
stairsnow
.
<EOS>
""Zounds
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Sir
Bulkeley
,
"
this
is
awkward!""There
is
nothing
to
fear
,
"
said
Firebras
,
calmly
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
plenty
oftime
for
flight
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
you
can
fly
,
gentlemen
,
but
I
am
ruined
,
"
exclaimed
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"I
can
never
return
to
my
own
dwelling!""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
you
shall
never
be
the
worse
for
it
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
what
will
become
of
me
if
I
am
taken
?
"
cried
Mr.
Cripps
,
feigning
alook
of
despair
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
sure
to
be
the
worse
for
it
.
<EOS>
""Silence
!
"
cried
Firebras
,
authoritatively--"don't
you
hear
them?--theyare
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
Be
quick
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
is
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
this
was
passing
,
Father
Verselyn
hurried
to
the
lower
end
of
theroom
,
and
mounting
a
ladder
placed
against
the
wall
,
passed
through
atrap
door
in
the
ceiling
above
it
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
Mr.
Cripps
,
and
Mr
.
Travers
next
ascended
,
then
Sir
Bulkeley
followed
,
then
Sir
Norfolk
,
whose
equanimity
not
even
the
present
danger
could
disturb
--
whileFirebras
brought
up
the
rear
.
<EOS>
"'Sdeath
!
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
cried
the
latter
,
as
the
baronet
slowly
scaledthe
steps
before
him--"move
on
a
little
more
quickly
,
or
we
shallcertainly
be
captured
.
<EOS>
They
're
breaking
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
hearthem?""Perfectly
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
,
coolly
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
on
that
accountaccelerate
his
movements
.
<EOS>
Knowing
it
was
in
vain
to
remonstrate
,
Cordwell
Firebras
waited
till
SirNorfolk
had
worked
his
long
frame
through
the
trap
door
,
which
he
didwith
the
utmost
deliberation
,
and
then
ran
up
the
steps
himself
,
withmuch
more
activity
than
might
have
been
expected
from
a
person
soweighty
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
was
quitting
the
ladder
,
the
door
was
burst
openwith
a
tremendous
crash
,
and
two
officers
of
the
guard
rushed
into
theroom
,
sword
in
hand
,
followed
by
a
dozen
grenadiers
,
armed
with
muskets
,
on
which
bayonets
were
fixed
.
<EOS>
Firebras
's
first
object
,
on
securing
afooting
on
the
floor
of
the
garret
above
was
to
try
to
draw
up
theladder
,
and
he
was
assisted
in
it
by
Sir
Norfolk
;
but
their
design
wasfrustrated
by
the
foremost
officer
and
a
tall
grenadier
bearing
ahalbert
,
both
of
whom
sprang
upon
the
ladder
,
and
kept
it
down
by
theirjoint
weight
,
and
all
those
above
could
do
was
to
shut
down
the
trapdoor
before
it
could
be
reached
by
their
foes
.
<EOS>
A
dormer
window
openedfrom
the
garret
upon
the
roof
of
the
house
,
but
an
unexpected
difficultyhad
been
experienced
by
the
first
detachment
of
fugitives
in

<EOS>
All
ought
to
have
been
in
readiness
for
an
emergency
like
thepresent
,
and
Sir
Bulkeley
and
Mr.
Travers
bitterly
reproached
thelandlord
for
his
negligence
.
<EOS>
The
poor
fellow
declared
that
the
mischancewas
not
his
fault
that
he
had
taken
every
possible
precaution
--
and
,
infact
had
examined
the
window
that
very
morning
,
and
found
it
all
right
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
it
was
forced
back
;
and
all
but
Sir
Norfolk
and
Firebras
gotthrough
it
.
<EOS>
They
were
detained
by
the
necessity
that
existed
of
guardingthe
trap
-
door
.
<EOS>
Unfortunately
,
there
was
no
bolt
on
the
upper
side
of
it
,
so
that
they
had
to
stand
upon
it
to
keep
it
down
,
and
this
plan
beingdiscovered
by
the
officer
below
,
he
ordered
two
of
his
men
to
thrusttheir
bayonets
through
the
boards
,
while
the
tall
grenadier
tried
toprize
open
the
door
with
his
halbert
.
<EOS>
The
manouvre
compelled
Firebrasand
Salusbury
slightly
to
alter
their
position
,
to
avoid
being
woundedby
the
bayonets
,
and
in
doing
so
,
they
necessarily
gave
admittance
tothe
point
of
the
halbert
.
<EOS>
The
efforts
of
the
assailing
party
wereredoubled
,
and
the
trap
slightly
yielded
.
<EOS>
"Lose
<EOS>
not
a
moment
!
<EOS>
fly
,
Sir
Norfolk
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Firebras
,
apprehensive
lestthe
baronet
's
deliberation
,
which
he
well
knew
nothing
could
shake
,
should
prevent
his
escape
.
<EOS>
But
true
to
his
principles
,
Sir
Norfolk
would
not
move
an
inch
.
<EOS>
"I
can
not
leave
you
in
angusto
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
am
the
stronger
of
the
two
,
as
well
as
the
more
active
,
"
rejoinedFirebras
.
<EOS>
"
My
weight
will
suffice
to
keep
down
the
trap
-
door
till
youhave
got
through
the
window
,
and
then
I
can
make
good
my
retreat
.
<EOS>
Fly!fly!"But
Sir
Norfolk
continued
immovable
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
be
the
last
to
quit
this
place
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
tone
ofunalterable
determination
.
"
<EOS>
But
do
not
,
I
pray
you
,
tarry
with
me
.
<EOS>
Thetrifurciferous
myrmidons
of
the
Hanoverion
usurper
shall
never
take
mewith
life
.
<EOS>
""I
must
leave
the
punctilious
old
fool
to
his
fate
,
"
muttered
Firebras
,
observing
that
the
greater
part
of
the
head
of
the
halbert
was
forcedthrough
the
side
of
the
trap
.
<EOS>
"
God
protect
you
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
rushing
to
the
window
.
<EOS>
The
brave
old
Welsh
baronet
essayed
to
hew
off
the
head
of
the
halbertfrom
the
staff
--
but
in
vain
;
and
finding
that
the
enemy
must
gainadmittance
in
another
moment
,
and
that
Firebras
had
cleared
the
window
,
he
turned
away
,
and
strode
majestically
towards
it
.
<EOS>
His
retreat
was
sosuddenly
made
,
that
the
grenadier
who
held
the
pike
and
was
prizing
withall
his
force
,
lost
his
balance
,
and
tumbled
off
the
ladder
,
causingsuch
confusion
among
his
comrades
,
that
Sir
Norfolk
had
time
to
getthrough
the
window
unmolested
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
beautifully
bright
night
--
the
moon
being
at
the
full
,
and
thesky
filled
with
fleecy
clouds
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
,
lay
ridges
of
pointed
-
roofedhouses
,
covered
with
the
warm
-
looking
and
mellow
-
tinted
tile
,
sopreferable
to
the
cold
blue
slate
--
broken
with
stacks
of
chimneys
ofevery
size
and
form
--
dormer
windows
,
gables
,
overhanging
stories
andother
picturesque
and
fantastic
projections
;
and
the
view
beingterminated
,
at
some
quarter
of
a
mile
's
distance
,
by
the
tall
towers
andpart
of
the
roof
of
Westminster
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Viewed
thus
,
the
whole
picture
looked
exquisitely
tranquil
andbeautiful
.
<EOS>
The
fires
in
the
houses
were
almost
all
extinguished
,
andlittle
or
no
smoke
issued
from
the
chimneys
to
pollute
the
clearatmosphere
.
<EOS>
Right
over
the
venerable
and
majestic
fane
hung
the
queen
ofnight
,
flooding
its
towers
--
seen
at
such
an
hour
to
the
greatestadvantage
--
with
silvery
light
,
and
throwing
some
of
the
nearer
buildingsand
projections
into
deep
shadow
,
and
so
adding
to
the
beauty
of
thescene
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
the
view
extended
over
other
house
-
tops
to
thegardens
and
and
fields
of
Pimlico
.
<EOS>
Behind
,
was
Saint
James
's
Park
,
withits
stately
avenues
of
trees
,
its
long
canal
,
and
Rosamond
's
Pondglimmering
in
the
moonlight
;
while
in
front
lay
the
Artillery
-
ground
,
and
the
open
and
marshy
grounds
constituting
Tothill
Fields
.
<EOS>
But
it
willbe
readily
imagined
that
neither
Firebras
nor
his
companions
looked
tothe
right
or
to
the
left
.
<EOS>
They
were
only
conscious
of
the
danger
bywhich
<EOS>
they
were
menaced
,
and
were
further
discouraged
by
FatherVerselyn
,
who
at
that
moment
scrambled
over
the
roof
they
were
about
tocross
,
to
inform
them
that
the
door
by
which
they
hoped
to
escape
couldnot
be
got
open
.
<EOS>
"Everything
<EOS>
seems
to
have
gone
wrong
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Verselyn
,
in
an
ecstacy
ofterror
.
<EOS>
"What
will
become
of
us?""Jacta
est
alea
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
,
composedly
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
fight
forit
,
father
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
<EOS>
and
all
its
saints
protect
us
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
priest
,
crossinghimself
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
composed
,
father
,
"
rejoined
Firebras
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
You
ought
to
beequal
to
the
circumstances
in
which
you
may
be
placed
.
<EOS>
Ha!"The
latter
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
a
joyous
shout
,
announcing
thattheir
friends
had
succeeded
in
opening
the
door
;
and
the
next
moment
,
the
good
news
was
confirmed
by
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
who
clambered
overthe
roof
to
acquaint
them
with
it
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
,
the
party
instantlybeat
a
retreat
;
and
their
flight
was
accelerated
by
the
officer
and
thetall
grenadier
,
who
at
that
moment
sprung
out
of
the
window
.
<EOS>
Even
SirNorfolk
was
urged
to
a
little
more
expedition
than
usual
;
and
two
orthree
of
his
mighty
strides
brought
him
to
the
top
of
the
roof
.
<EOS>
CordwellFirebras
would
not
have
been
much
behind
him
,
if
Father
Verselyn
had
notcaught
hold
of
his
coat
tails
to
help
him
up
the
ascent
,
which
he
feltwholly
unable
to
accomplish
without
assistance
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
theofficer
was
well
nigh
upon
them
;
and
,
finding
his
summons
to
surrenderwholly
disregarded
,
he
made
a
pass
at
the
priest
,
which
took
effect
inthe
fleshy
part
of
his
leg
,
restoring
him
at
once
to
more
than
hisformer
agility
.
<EOS>
Uttering
a
loud
yell
,
and
clapping
his
hand
to
thewounded
limb
to
staunch
the
blood
,
Father
Verselyn
bounded
over
the
roofand
made
to
the
door
,
through
which
the
landlord
and
Mr.
Travers
hadalready
disappeared
,
and
through
which
Mr.
Cripps
was
now
darting
.
<EOS>
Between
the
two
roofs
lay
a
small
flat
space
,
used
by
its
formerproprietor
as
a
place
to
dry
clothes
on
,
as
was
evident
from
the
fourtall
posts
at
the
corners
.
<EOS>
On
this
place
Firebras
and
Sir
Norfolk
cameto
a
stand
,
resolved
to
dispute
the
passage
with
their
pursuers
.
<EOS>
Swordin
hand
,
and
calling
to
them
to
surrender
,
the
foremost
officer
dasheddown
the
roof
.
<EOS>
But
his
precipitation
placed
him
at
the
mercy
ofFirebras
;
for
his
foot
slipping
,
the
latter
struck
his
sword
from
hisgrasp
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
,
in
the
interim
,
had
encountered
another
foeman
withequal
success
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
tall
grenadier
,
who
as
he
descended
made
athrust
at
the
baronet
with
his
halbert
,
which
the
latter
very
adroitlyparried
,
and
lunging
in
return
,
disabled
his
adversary
by
a
wound
in
thearm
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
too
,
the
tiles
gave
way
under
the
weight
of
thegrenadier
,
and
he
sunk
above
the
knees
in
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Other
foes
were
nowat
hand
.
<EOS>
The
second
officer
,
carrying
a
lantern
in
one
hand
,
and
a
drawnsword
in
the
other
,
appeared
on
the
roof
;
while
the
tall
caps
andbayonets
of
the
rest
of
the
grenadiers
were
seen
above
it
.
<EOS>
Though
SirNorfolk
,
whose
blood
was
up
,
would
have
willingly
awaited
the
advance
ofthese
new
opponents
,
he
yielded
to
the
entreaties
of
Firebras
,
andfollowed
him
through
the
door
,
which
was
instantly
secured
behind
themby
a
couple
of
strong
bolts
.
<EOS>
The
house
in
which
the
Jacobites
had
taken
refuge
was
expressly
hired
bythem
for
an
occasion
like
the
present
,
and
kept
wholly
uninhabited
.
<EOS>
Themode
of
communication
between
it
and
the
Rose
and
Crown
<EOS>
will
,
it
ishoped
,
be
sufficiently
understood
from
the
foregoing
description
.
<EOS>
Thatso
many
unforeseen
accidents
should
have
occurred
at
a
time
when
,
ifever
,
things
ought
to
have
been
in
readiness
,
almost
drove
the
poorlandlord
distracted
;
but
if
he
could
have
watched
Mr.
Cripps'smanoeuvres
,
he
would
have
speedily
found
out
the
cause
of
the
delays
.
<EOS>
Inthe
first
instance
,
a
penknife
,
dexterously
slipped
by
the
valet
intothe
groove
of
the
window
,
prevented
it
from
moving
,
and
had
well
-
nigh
,
as
has
been
seen
,
occasioned
the
capture
of
the
fugitives
.
<EOS>
Thisdifficulty
having
been
overcome
by
the
strenuous
efforts
of
Sir
Bulkeleyand
Mr.
Travers
,
Mr.
Cripps
was
the
first
to
scramble
through
thewindow
.
<EOS>
"Which
way
?
"
<EOS>
He
cried
to
the
landlord
,
who
was
following
.
<EOS>
"Over
the
roof
,
and
to
the
door
opposite
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
Nimbly
as
a
cat
,
the
agile
valet
bounded
over
the
roof
,
and
instantlyperceiving
the
door
,
made
towards
it
.
<EOS>
A
key
was
in
the
lock
;
he
turnedit
,
took
it
out
,
and
dropped
it
into
the
street
below
.
<EOS>
He
then
began
toshake
the
door
violently
,
and
shouted
to
the
landlord
,
who
at
thatmoment
came
in
sight
.
<EOS>
"Unlock
<EOS>
it
<EOS>
--
unlock
it
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
host
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
ca
n't
,
"
cried
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
there
is
no
key
.
'
<EOS>
Pon
rep
!
<EOS>
we
shall
be
alltaken
.
<EOS>
""No
key
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
landlord
.
"
<EOS>
Impossible
!
<EOS>
I
saw
it
there
thismorning
myself
.
<EOS>
It
must
have
dropped
down
.
<EOS>
Look
about
for
it
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
feigned
compliance
,
and
the
landlord
coming
up
,
poured
fortha
torrent
of
imprecations
on
finding
his
statement
correct
.
<EOS>
FatherVerselyn
,
as
has
been
related
,
crept
back
to
Firebras
,
while
the
othersused
their
efforts
to
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
they
long
in
effectingtheir
purpose
.
<EOS>
Finding
all
other
attempts
fail
,
the
landlord
steppedback
on
the
leads
,
and
running
to
give
an
additional
impetus
to
theblow
,
dashed
his
foot
against
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
lock
yielded
with
a
loudcrash
.
<EOS>
Baulked
in
his
schemes
,
the
plotting
valet
would
fain
have
practisedsome
new
trick
upon
them
,
but
the
presence
of
Cordwell
Firebras
,
whosesuspicions
he
was
fearful
of
arousing
,
restrained
him
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
hadlittle
opportunity
for
further
display
of
his
art
.
<EOS>
Ordering
the
othersto
go
down
stairs
,
Firebras
only
tarried
to
lock
an
inner
door
,
and
thenfollowed
them
.
<EOS>
The
house
,
as
already
stated
,
was
perfectly
empty
,
and
opened
at
theback
into
a
court
,
which
branched
off
into
several
of
those
intricatealleys
with
which
Petty
France
abounds
.
<EOS>
Two
minutes
had
not
elapsedbefore
the
fugitives
found
shelter
in
this
court
,
and
were
rapidlythreading
it
;
and
though
they
were
noticed
by
some
of
the
neighbours
,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
the
shouts
of
the
soldiery
,
and
who
took
themfor
a
gang
of
housebreakers
,
they
effected
their
retreat
without
furthermolestation
.
<EOS>
The
officer
and
his
followers
succeeded
in
breaking
intothe
garret
;
but
before
they
could
burst
open
the
inner
door
,
the
partyhad
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
Guided
by
the
landlord
,
the
priest
and
Mr.
Travers
scudded
through
alabyrinth
of
passages
leading
in
the
direction
of
the
Chapel
,
whichbuilding
they
skirted
on
the
left
,
and
crossing
Stretton
's
Ground
,
founda
secure
asylum
at
a
small
public
-
house
in
Duck
-
lane
,
where
the
landlordwas
known
,
and
where
the
unfortunate
priest
who
had
become
very
faintfrom
loss
of
blood
,
was
enabled
to
get
his
wound
dressed
.
<EOS>
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
and
Firebras
,
took
the
oppositedirection
;
and
after
traversing
several
narrow
passages
,
reachedJames
-
street
,
here
,
finding
they
were
not
pursued
,
they
slackened
theirpace
,
and
entering
the
Park
at
the
gate
near
the
lower
end
of
Rosamond'sPond
,
proceeded
to
Firebras
's
lodgings
.
<EOS>
A
slight
tap
against
the
windowspeedily
procured
them
admittance
.
<EOS>
The
shutters
were
then
closed
,
andFirebras
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
and
for
some
minutes
maintained
aprofound
silence
,
which
neither
of
his
companions
seemed
disposed
tobreak
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
gentlemen
,
"
he
said
at
length
,
"
our
meetings
at
the
Rose
andCrown

<EOS>
We
must
find
some
other
place

""There

replied
Sir

calmly

<EOS>
""In

my

remarked
SirBulkeley
;

"Firebras
said
nothing
;
but
rose
,
and
opening
a
cupboard
,
took
out
abottle
of

glasses

and
set
them
before

<EOS>
SirBulkeley
quickly
tossed
off
a
couple
of
glasses
;
but
Sir
Norfolk
,
whowas
a
pattern
of
sobriety
,
as
he
was
a
model
of
punctilio
,
declined
todrink

<EOS>
They
then
fell
into
debate
,

it
was
broad
daylight
before

taking
his

across

It
now
only
remains
to

He
followed

for
a
short
distance
,
and
then
coming
to
a
halt
,
held
a
brief
communion
with
himself
.
<EOS>
"I
have
failed
this
time
,
"
he
thought
;
"
but
it
is
all
owing
to
the
badmanagement
of
that
brainless
little
barber
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
'll
take
care
hehas
the
full
blame
of
it
with
the
Jacobites
;
and
the
next
time
I
attempttheir
capture
,
I
'll
make
sure
work
of
it
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
no
use
lodginginformation
against
any
of
them
,
for
no
proof
can
now
be
obtained
oftheir
being
present
at
the
meeting
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
<EOS>
;
I
must
keep
upon
terms
withthem
,
and
abide
my
time
.
<EOS>
They
must
all
be
taken
in
the
fact
;
and
then
myreward
will
be
proportionate
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
whether
Pokerich
is
in
safety
.
<EOS>
Isaw
the
little
rascal
among
the
guard
on
the
house
top
,
and
he
lookedalmost
as
much
frightened
as
Father
Verselyn
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
something
maybe
made
of
that
priest
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
double
dealer
I
'll
be
sworn
.
'
<EOS>
Pon
rep
!
<EOS>
Ilike
these
nocturnal
adventures
vastly
.
<EOS>
They
remind
me
of
the
romancesI've
read
,
and
make
me
fancy
myself
a
hero
.
<EOS>
A
hero
!
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
the
heroes
ofromance
do
n't
generally
betray
their
friends
.
<EOS>
But
that
only
shows
thatthose
authors
do
n't
draw
from
real
life
.
<EOS>
But
I
must
go
home
,
and
get
alittle
rest
,
or
I
sha'n't
be
in
the
cue
for
Marylebone
Gardens

RECEIVES
A
NOTE
FROM

--
<EOS>
JACOB
POST
BRINGSINFORMATION
TO
<EOS>
ABEL.Shortly
after
Hilda
's
departure
,
Abel
Beechcroft
summoned
his
butler
,
and
informed
him
he
was
going
out
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
be
back
in
time
for
dinner,"he
said
.
<EOS>
"
If
Miss
Scarve
should
call
again
during
my
absence
which
isnot
impossible
,
though
I
think
it
unlikely
,
shew
her
into
the
library;and
take
care
that
Randulph
does
not
see
her
.
<EOS>
""I
was
in
hopes
,
sir
,
that
your
interview
with
that
dear
young
ladymight
have
altered
your
views
in
regard
to
your
nephew
,
"
replied
Mr
.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
been
pleasing
myself
with
the
idea
of
the
nice
wife
she'dmake
<EOS>
Mr.
Randulph
.
<EOS>
They
seem
cut
out
for
each
other
--
just
of
an
age
--
andit
's
difficult
to
say
which
is
the
handsomest
.
<EOS>
Bless
my
heart
!
<EOS>
if
themarriage
should
take
place
,
what
a
feast
we
should
have
,
and
how
busy
Ishould
be
!
<EOS>
And
then
,
of
course
you
'd
have
the
young
folks
to
live
withyou
;
and
you
'd
get
so
fond
of
your
new
niece
,
that
you
would
n't
bear
herout
of
sight
for
an
instant
,
but
would
be
happier
than
you
have
beenbefore
.
<EOS>
And
then
,
in
due
time
,
you
'd
have
to
turn
one
of
the
upper
roomsinto
a
nursery
,
and
I
should
see
you
sitting
in
your
easy
chair
,
notwith
a
book
before
you
,
blinding
your
eyes
,
but
with
young
Master
Crewon
a
rockinghorse
on
one
side
,
and
young
Miss
Crew
on
t'other
,
while
thenurse
would
be
bringing
you
a
third
crowing
little
bantling
in
longpetticoats
,
encouraging
the
growth
of
its
teeth
,
and
cultivating
a
tastefor
music
at
the
same
time
with
a
silver
rattle
.
<EOS>
""Heaven
forbid
!
"
<EOS>
ejaculated
Abel
,
who
had
allowed
the
butler
to
rambleon
in
his
own
way
.
"
<EOS>
Your
notions
and
mine
of
domestic
happiness
differmaterially
.
<EOS>
I
've
always
treated
you
with
great
confidence
,
Jukes
,
"
headded
,
gravely
;
"
and
I
confess
I
should
be
glad
to
see
Randulph
well
andhappily
married
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
in
no
hurry
about
it
.
<EOS>
It
is
desirable
heshould
see
something
of
the
world
--
something
more
of
female
society
,
inorder
that
he
may
understand
his
own
tastes
better
before
he
takes
astep
on
which
the
whole
happiness
or
misery
of
his
life
will
hang
.
<EOS>
It'sa
sad
thing
to
discover
,
when
too
late
,
that
he
has
n't
chosen
well
.
<EOS>
""It
must
be
rather
disagreeable
,
no
doubt
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
but
Idon't
consider
an
old
bachelor
like
you
a
competent
judge
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
However
,
if
Mr.
Randulph
chooses
Miss
Hilda
,
he
'll
choose
well
,
that
I'mprepared
to
maintain
.
<EOS>
""Jukes
,
"
said
Abel
,
sternly
,
"
it
is
time
to
check
your
loquacity
.
<EOS>
Muchas
<EOS>
I
am
pleased
with
Hilda
Scarve
--
<EOS>
and
I
assure
you
she
has
won
upon
myaffections
in
an
extraordinary
manner
--
I
do
not
desire
,
for
reasonswhich
it
is
needless
to
explain
,
that
she
should
become
the
bride
of
mynephew
.
<EOS>
""I
confess
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
fathom
your
motive
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes;"unless
--
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
thought
you
too
old
.
<EOS>
""Too
<EOS>
old
for
what
,
Jukes
?
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
all
events
,
I
should
have
thought
her
too
young
,
"
pursued
thebutler
.
"
<EOS>
But
stranger
things
have
happened
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
the
duce
<EOS>
do
you
mean
to
insinuate
,
sirrah
?
"
cried
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
I
fancy
you
want
to
marry
Miss
Hilda
yourself
,
sir
,
"
replied
thebutler
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
'm
sure
I
've
no
objection,--none
on
earth
,
if
you
can
getthe
lady
's
consent
.
<EOS>
Only
I
think
there
's
a
little
too
much
disparity
,
that
's
all
.
<EOS>
"Abel
flushed
to
his
very
temples
,
and
then
became
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
He
madeno
reply
,
however
,
but
walked
quickly
towards
the
window
,
returning
thenext
moment
with
his
wonted
composure
.
<EOS>
"I
scarcely
know
whether
to
laugh
at
you
,
or
reprove
you
for
yourstrange
supposition
,
Jukes
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
In
any
other
case
than
this
,
Icertainly
should
have
been
angry
,
but
here
,
"
he
continued
,
in
aslightly
-
tremulous
tone
,
"
my
feelings
are
too
deeply
interested
.
<EOS>
No
,
Jukes
,
I
shall
never
marry
,
least
of
all
,
the
daughter
of--
"
<EOS>
here
hisutterance
failed
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
understand
,
sir
,
"
resumed
Jukes
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
say
another
word
.
<EOS>
Isee
my
mistake
.
<EOS>
""Then
repair
it
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
recovering
himself
.
<EOS>
"
Mind
,
I
will
haveno
excuse
for
neglecting
my
instructions
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
proceeded
to
the
hall
,
and
taking
up
his
hat
and
stick
,
reiterated
his
injunctions
to
the
butler
,
and
went
forth
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
returned
to
his
pantry
,
ruminating
on
what
had
occurred
,
andmuttering
to
himself
,
"
I
almost
wish
our
quiet
house
had
n't
beendisturbed
by
these
young
people
.
<EOS>
I
perceive
plainly
that
Randulph
willfall
over
head
and
ears
in
love
with
Hilda
--
if
he
has
n't
done
soalready
--
<EOS>
and
then
my
master
'll
quarrel
with
him
,
and
then
--
<EOS>
but
no
,
he'ssure
to
pardon
him
,
just
as
I
always
overlook
the
faults
of
my
gracelessnephew
,
Crackenthorpe
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
wo
nt
do
for
me
to
bring
'em
<EOS>
together;and
<EOS>
I
hope
the
young
lady
may
n't
come
back
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
apprehensions
were
groundless
.
<EOS>
At
the
very
time
he
was
thinking
ofher
,
Hilda
was
passing
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
At
a
little
before
four
o'clock
,
Abel
Beechcroft
returned
,
and
seemedmuch
relieved
to
find
that
nothing
had
occurred
during
his
absence
.
<EOS>
Hesat
down
to
dinner
by
himself
at
the
appointed
time
,
discussed
the
mealin
silence
,
and
even
when
the
wine
was
placed
before
him
,
evinced
solittle
disposition
to
talk
,
that
Mr.
Jukes
took
the
hint
,
and
left
himalone
.
<EOS>
He
continued
in
the
same
mood
during
the
whole
evening
--
<EOS>
readingas
long
as
the
light
permitted
,
and
then
repairing
to
the
garden
,
wherehe
remained
till
he
was
summoned
to
supper
.
<EOS>
In
reply
to
his
inquirieswhether
his
brother
and
nephew
had
come
back
,
he
was
told
that
theformer
had
returned
about
an
hour
ago
,
alone
.
"Alone
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Abel
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
,
and
glancing
triumphantlyat
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
you
how
it
would
be
.
<EOS>
His
career
of
dissipation
hasbegun
with
a
vengeance
.
<EOS>
Where
will
it
end
,
eh?--where
will
it
end
,
Jukes
?
<EOS>
Tell
me
that
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
I
could
,
"
responded
the
latter
,
with
something
like
a
groan
.
<EOS>
Abel
found
his
brother
in
the
supper
-
room
,
and
at
once
perceived
fromhis
uncertain
movements
and
flushed
looks
,
that
he
had
taken
too
muchwine
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
have
not
brought
your
pupil
home
with
you
,
"
he
observed
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
he?""'Pon
my
soul
<EOS>
,
that
's
more
than
I
can
tell
!
"
<EOS>
laughed
Trussell
<EOS>
,
"
He
dinedwith
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
and
myself
at
a
French
ordinary
inSuffolk
-
street
,
and
left
us
to
keep
an
appointment
--
he
!
<EOS>
he!--soon
<EOS>
afterfive
o'clock
.
<EOS>
I
expected
to
find
him
here
on
my
return
;
but
I
suppose
hehas
been
detained
.
<EOS>
You
must
make
allowances
for
young
men
,
sir
.
<EOS>
It
ishis
first
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""I
hope
it
will
be
his
last
,
"
replied
Abel
,
seating
himself
.
<EOS>
And
as
thesupper
proceeded
,
he
elicited
from
Trussell
,
whose
condition
renderedhim
extremely
communicative
,
a
full
account
of
all
that
had
occurredduring
the
morning
,
including
even
the
glimpse
they
had
obtained
ofHilda
,
at
the
time
of
her
passing
the
Folly
.
"And
<EOS>
did
she
see
Randulph
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Abel
,
quickly
.
<EOS>
"To
be
sure
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
laughing
;
"
she
could
n't
help
it
.
<EOS>
Theboat
was
close
to
us
,
and
egad
!
<EOS>
I
must
say
,
if
I
'm
any
judge
of
suchmatters
--
which
I
flatter
myself
<EOS>
I
am
--
she
looked
desperately
annoyed
atseeing
him
with
the
pretty
actress
--
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
Your
health
,
brother
,
"
headded
,
raising
a
bumper
of
claret
,
poured
out
by
the
butler
,
to
hislips
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
not
sorry
for
the
rencounter
,
"
muttered
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
glass
of
whitewine
,
Jukes
?
<EOS>
Brother
,
I
drink
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
how
did
Randulph
behave
on
theoccasion?""It
<EOS>
embarrassed
him
devilishly
,
"
rejoined
Trussell
;
"
and
in
fact
hedidn't
recover
himself
during
the
whole
day
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
thoughtfully
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
is
gone
to
visit
thepretty
actress
,
Kitty
Conway
,
to
-
night
--
<EOS>
eh?""I'faith
,
I
ca
n't
say
,
replied
Trussell
,
"
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
I
left
him
to
hisown
devices
.
<EOS>
But
we
shall
have
him
back
presently
;
and
then
you
cancatechise
him
yourself
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!"Trussell
continued
talking
,
laughing
,
and
quaffing
during
the
whole
ofthe
supper
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
far
too
jovial
a
mood
to
notice
,
or
heed
,
if
hedid
notice
them
,
the
grave
looks
of
his
brother
,
at
his
boasts
of
theintroductions
he
should
give
his
nephew
,
the
sights
he
would
shew
him
,
and
the
perfect
gentleman
he
would
make
him
.
<EOS>
Abel
's
brow
grew
dark
asthe
clock
struck
eleven
,
and
Randulph
had
not
returned
.
<EOS>
He
made
noremark
,
however
,
but
rising
,
called
for
a
light
,
and
wishing
his
brothergood
night
,
retired
to
rest
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
afraid
Mr.
Randulph
has
displeased
his
uncle
,
Mr.
Trussell
,
"
saidMr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
he
had
come
home
before
the
old
gentleman
went
tobed
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
he
had
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
laughing
;
"
but
it
ca
n't
behelped
.
<EOS>
Boys
will
be
boys
.
<EOS>
I
need
n't
tell
you
I
was
just
such
another
athis
age
.
<EOS>
""You
were
a
great
deal
worse
than
he
'll
ever
be
<EOS>
,
I
hope
,
"
replied
thebutler
.
<EOS>
"Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
I
fear
so
,
Jukes
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
smiling
,
as
if
a
highcompliment
had
been
paid
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
a
sad
fellow
--
a
sad
fellow
!
<EOS>
I'vebeen
talking
over
old
times
and
old
adventures
with
Sir
SingletonSpinke
;
and
I
fear
we
were
terrible
rakes
--
he
!
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
The
young
men
of
thepresent
day
have
sadly
degenerated
.
<EOS>
They
have
n't
half
the
spirit
of
thebeaux
of
good
Queen
Ann
's
days
,
when
I
was
young
--
that
is
,
when
I
was
aboy
,
for
I
'm
young
still
.
<EOS>
The
bottle
's
empty
,
Jukes
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
,
youthink
I
've
had
wine
enough
.
<EOS>
And
,
i'faith
,
I
almost
think
I
have
myself
.
<EOS>
So
I
'll
e'en
seek
my
pillow
.
<EOS>
Sit
up
for
Randulph
,
Jukes
.
<EOS>
I
'll
lecturehim
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
Carry
the
candle
,
old
fellow
,
and
lend
me
your
arm
,
for
I
do
n't
feel
quite
so
steady
as
usual

<EOS>
And
in
this
way
he
wasconveyed
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
Abel
's
first
inquiry
,
when
Mr.
Jukes
entered
his
room
on
the
followingmorning
at
seven
o'clock
,
was
as
to
the
time
at
which
his
nephewreturned
overnight
,
and
he
received
for
reply
,
"
Oh

,
sir
.
<EOS>
I
did
n't
exactly
observe
.
<EOS>
""You
took
care
not
to
do
so
,
"
rejoined
Abel
.
"
<EOS>
But
what
account
did
hegive
of
himself?""I
really
did
n't
question
him
,
sir
,
"
returned
Mr.
Jukes--"He
<EOS>
went
to
bedalmost
immediately
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
retired
late
,
he
's
up
early
enough
;
forhe
's
in
the
garden
already
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
deuce
he
is
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
getting
up
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
come
,
that
's
in
hisfavour
,
at
all
events
.
<EOS>
My
dressing
-
gown
,
Jukes
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I
might
offer
an
opinion
,
sir
,
"
said
the
butler
,
as
he
assisted
hismaster
to
put
on
his
morning
-
robe
,
"
I
should
say
Mr.
Randulph
hasn'tbeen
at
a
gay
party
.
<EOS>
He
looks
very
thoughtful
,
and
as
if
he
hadsomething
in
his
mind
.
<EOS>
I
hope
he
is
n't
going
to
fight
a
duel
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
not
,
"
cried
Abel
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"
That
may
account
for
his
getting
upso
early
.
<EOS>
I
must
see
him
,
and
prevent
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
him
go
out
,
on
anyaccount
,
till
I
come
down
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
dressed
himself
as
expeditiously
as
he
could
,
he
proceeded
to
thegarden
,
where
he
found
his
nephew
looking
quite
as
pensive
as
he
hadbeen
described
by
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"You
were
late
home
last
night
,
Randulph
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
after
the
usualgreeting
had
passed
between
them
.
<EOS>
"I
was
,
indeed
,
much
later
than
I
intended
,
uncle
;
"
replied
the
youngman
;
"
but
I
was
unavoidably
detained
.
<EOS>
""May
<EOS>
I
ask
in
what
way
?
"
rejoined
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Pardon
<EOS>
me
,
uncle
,
if
I
do
not
answer
the
question
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
press
you
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
severely
.
"
<EOS>
But
upon
one
point
Irequire
a
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
You
have
not
,
I
trust
,
an
affair
of
honour
,
socalled
--
but
most
mistakenly
--
on
hand?""I
have
not
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Randulph
,
emphatically
.
<EOS>
"I
believe
you
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
"
<EOS>
And
so
I
am
told
you
saw
Hilda
Scarveyesterday
,
and
under
circumstances
not
very
agreeable
to
yourself?"The
young
man
blushed
deeply
.
<EOS>
"I
am
not
sorry
to
find
you
have
some
shame
left
,
"
said
his
uncle
;
"
andtrust
the
occurrence
may
prove
a
wholesome
lesson
to
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
whileI
am
lecturing
you
,
let
me
add
that
there
are
other
dangers
to
which
youmay
be
exposed
,
besides
those
arising
from
pretty
actresses
,
anddissipation
.
<EOS>
I
mean
political
dangers
--
dangers
springing
from
the
secretsocieties
and
their
agents
.
<EOS>
Your
father
,
I
am
aware
,
inclined
to
theJacobite
cause
;
and
I
am
aware
,
also
,
that
your
mother
had
,
and
stillhas
,
the
same
bias
.
<EOS>
But
she
gave
me
to
understand
you
were
a
stanchHanoverian
.
<EOS>
Has
she
misrepresented
you?""Most
assuredly
not
!
"
<EOS>
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
troubled
myself
solittle
about
the
matter
,
that
it
is
only
lately
that
I
have
discoveredthat
her
opinions
were
adverse
to
my
own
.
<EOS>
I
am
obliged
to
you
for
thecaution
you
have
given
me
.
<EOS>
Do
you
chance
to
know
a
gentleman
namedCordwell
Firebras?""The
name
seems
familiar
to
me
,
"
replied
Abel
,
musing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
now
Irecollect
it
.
<EOS>
It
belonged
to
a
person
who
was
concerned
in
the
Rebellionof
'
15
,
and
had
well
-
nigh
involved
your
father
in
it
.
<EOS>
But
what
of
him?"he
continued
,
regarding
Randulph
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
?
<EOS>
Have
you
methim
since
you
came
to
town?""I
must
again
decline
answering
the
question
,
uncle
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Your
declining
to
do
so
is
an
answer
in
this
case
,
"
rejoined
Abel
;
"
andI
must
warn
you
against
him
as
a
most
dangerous
person
.
<EOS>
Thirty
yearshave
elapsed
since
this
Firebras
placed
your
poor
father
in
fearfuljeopardy
.
<EOS>
But
if
he
is
the
person
I
have
heard
described
,
they
will
nothave
changed
him
.
<EOS>
""Set
<EOS>
your
mind
at
rest
as
to
his
influence
over
me
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
never
waver
in
my
loyalty
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
nephew
,
"
returned
Abel
;
"
for
rely
upon
it
,
ifunhappily
,
another
rebellion
should
break
out
,
it
will
end
asdisastrously
as
the
first
.
<EOS>
And
now
let
us
go
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
leading
the
way
to
the
house
,
they
sat
down
to
the
well
-
spreadboard
.
<EOS>
Trussell
did
not
make
his
appearance
,
and
the
meal
passed
offsatisfactorily
enough
,
until
towards
its
close
,
Mr.
Jukes
brought
anote
,
which
he
delivered
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
your
leave
,
uncle
,
"
said
Randulph
,
glancing
in
some
confusion
at
thesuperscription
,
and
recognising
the
hand
.
<EOS>
He
then
broke
the
seal
,
and
read
as
follows:--"I
am
going
to
Mr.
Scarve;and
if
I
have
an
assurance
of
regret
from
you
for
your
hasty
conductlast

,
and
an
undertaking
that
you
will
join
us
,
I
will
engage
toprocure
<EOS>
you

hand
of
his
daughter

<EOS>
Your
determination

for
to

he
is
about
to
sign
a
marriage
contract
withhis
nephew
,
Philip
Frewin

<EOS>
The
bearer
will
bring
you
to
me
,
if
youdesire
to
see
me

'
<EOS>
C.
F.'""You
seem
agitated

"
observed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
Are
the
contents
of
thatnote
secret?""Indeed
,
sir
,
they
are
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
"
<EOS>
And
,
what
is
more
,
I
mustanswer
them
in
person
.
<EOS>
""O
,
by
all
means
do
so
,
"
replied
Abel
,
testily
.
"
<EOS>
But
remember
mycaution
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
then
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
and
found
in
the
hall
,
thelandlord
of
the
Rose
and
Crown
,
who
had
brought
him
the
note
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
you
going
with
me
,
sir
?
"
asked
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
Randulph
replied
in
the
affirmative
;
and
they
quitted
the
housetogether
.
<EOS>
Abel
was
a
good
deal
surprised
and
annoyed
at
his
nephew
's
departure
,
and
repaired
to
his
library
,
where
he
endeavoured
to
compose
histhoughts
with
a
book
.
<EOS>
But
the
remedy
in
this
instance
proved
futile
;
forwhen
Mr.
Jukes
entered
the
room
about
an
hour
afterwards
,
he
found
himpacing
to
and
fro
within
it
,
with
a
disturbed
air
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
is
Randulph
returned
?
"
he
asked
quickly
.
<EOS>
"No
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
come
to
say
that
Mr.
Scarve'sservant
,
Jacob
Post
,
is
without
,
and
wishes
to
speak
with
you
.
<EOS>
""What
's
is
his
business
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Abel
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"I
did
n't
inquire
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
but
something
I
shouldfancy
relating
to
Miss
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
butler
's
reply
was
here
a
little
wide
of
the
truth
.
<EOS>
He
had
tried
topump
Jacob
as
to
his
errand
,
but
the
latter
declined
to
satisfy
hiscuriosity
.
<EOS>
"Most
<EOS>
likely
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shew
him
in
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
the
next
moment
Jacob
was
admitted
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
crabstick
under
hisarm
,
and
twisted
his
hat
between
his
fingers
as
before
,
looking
any
waybut
direct
at
Abel
.
<EOS>
Seeing
that
his
presence
was
desired
by
neitherparty
,
Mr.
Jukes
retired
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
friend
,
what
has
brought
you
hither
?
"
asked
Abel
.
<EOS>
Jacob
coughed
,
and
tried
to
clear
away
the
huskiness
that
impeded
hisarticulation
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
come
to
see
whether
you
've
a
situation
for
me
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
aftersundry
ineffectual
attempts
at
plain
speaking
.
<EOS>
"
Wages
is
n't
an
objectwith
me
,
sir,--they
is
n't
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
And
I
should
like
to
serve
you
betterthan
<EOS>
any
other
gen'l'man
<EOS>
I
know
of
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
have
you
left
Mr.
Scarve
?
"
said
Abel
.
"Not
<EOS>
yet
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
But
he
's
given
me
notice
.
<EOS>
And
if
hehadn't
,
I
think
I
should
have
done
the
same
by
him
.
<EOS>
He
's
grown
<EOS>
worsethan
ever
.
<EOS>
He
promised
to
give
me
a
recommendation
to
you
.
<EOS>
But
I
don'tthink
he
meant
what
he
said
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
'll
see
what
can
be
done
for
you
,
"
rejoined
Abel
;
"
that
is
,
ifMr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
can
find
you
<EOS>
a
place,--for
<EOS>
I
must
leave
the
matter
entirely
tohim
.
<EOS>
But
what
about
your
young
mistress?""I
was
coming
to
her
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
thought
I
'd
settle
myown
affairs
first
.
<EOS>
I
've
no
good
news
to
tell
you
about
her
.
<EOS>
Masterlocked
her
in
her
own
room
last
night
,
and
he
declares
he
wo
nt
let
herout
till
she
consents
to
marry
his
ne'vy!"Abel
uttered
an
angry
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"Within
<EOS>
these
few
days
he
's
grown
a
downright
barbarous
domestictyrant
,
"
continued
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
There
's
no
bearin
'
him
.
<EOS>
But
to
be
sure
he
hadenough
to
put
him
out
of
his
way
yesterday
;
for
do
you
know
,
sir
,
he
wasrobbed
of
fourteen
thousand
pounds
during
our
absence
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
tookit
more
quietly
than
one
might
have
expected
;
and
I
ca
n't
help
thinkin'as
how
one
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
,
a
strange
gentleman
who
visited
himyestermorning
,
knew
somethin'
about
it
.
<EOS>
""Cordwell
<EOS>
Firebras
!
<EOS>
Has
he
been
with
him
?
"
<EOS>
said
Abel
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"He
was
with
him
twice
yesterday
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
And
a
note
came
fromhim
this
mornin
'
,
which
I
know
,
from
some
chance
expressions
<EOS>
let
fall
bythe
old
fellow
concernin
'
<EOS>
it
,
related
to
your
ne'vy
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
almost
fancy
Mr.
Firebras
advised
him
to
make
up
a
marriage
between'em
,
"
pursued
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"'Sdeath
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
furiously
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
How
dares
he
make
such
aproposition
?
<EOS>
Who
gave
him
commission
to
interfere?""That
's
more
than
I
can
tell
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
But
howsomedever
I
don'tthink
<EOS>
master'll
pay
much
attention
to
him
,
for
he
is
goin'
to
sign
amarriage
contract
with
Mr.
Philip
Frewin
and
his
attorney
this
mornin'
.
<EOS>
""It
must
not
be
,
"
rejoined
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
Frewin
is
an
impostor
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
thought
from
the
first
,
"
returned
Jacob
;
"
but
yesterday
it
wasconfirmed
to
me
.
"
<EOS>
And
he
proceeded
to
detail
what
he
had
witnessed
atthe
Folly
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
Abel
heard
him
in
silence
;
and
at
the
close
of
his
narration
said
,
"
muchas
I
dislike
your
master
,
painful
as
the
interview
will
be
to
me

I
willsee
him

Do
not
announce
my
coming

take

I
obtainadmittance

<EOS>
Get
some
refreshment
as
quickly
as
you
can
,
and
then
makethe
best
of
your
way
home

<EOS>
"Jacob
was
not
slow
in
obeying
the
injunction
.
<EOS>
Repairing
to
the
kitchen
,
in
less
than
five
minutes
he
laid
bare
a
cold
shoulder
of
lamb
,
despatched
half
a
dozen
lettuces
,
which
he
plunged
into
a
salt
-
stand
,
and
then
thrust
almost
whole
into
his
capacious
mouth
,
disposed
ofrather
better
than
half
a
loaf
,
and
washed
all
down
with
a
large
jug
ofstrong
ale

<EOS>
He
then
set
off
to
the
stairs
by
the
river
side
,
where
hisboat
awaited
him
,
and
jumping
into
it

pulled
off

'S
<EOS>
INTERVIEW
WITH
THE
MISER
--
<EOS>
UNEXPECTED
APPEARANCE
OF
RANDULPH
ANDCORDWELL
FIREBRAS
--
<EOS>
RESULT
OF
THE
MEETING.Half
<EOS>
an
hour
afterwards
,
Abel
Beechcroft
set
forth
;
and
taking
his
waybeneath
the
trees
of
the
Bishop
's
walk
--
his
own
favourite
promenade
,
where
he
used
to
pass
the
greater
portion
of
each
day
,
gazing
at
thebroad
and
beautiful
stream
flowing
past
it,--proceeded
along
theStangate
,
and
crossing
Westminster
Bridge
,
directed
his
steps
towardsthe
Little
Sanctuary
.
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
miser
's
dwelling
,
a
tide
oftumultuous
feeling
pressed
upon
him
,
and
he
almost
doubted
his
power
ofsustaining
the
interview
he
was
about
to
seek
;
but
stringing
himself
upto
the
task
,
he
knocked
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
summons
was
instantly
answeredby
Jacob
,
who
was
in
readiness
,
and
who
,
without
a
word
,
admitted
him
.
<EOS>
"You're
<EOS>
just
in
time
,
sir
,
"
said
the
latter
,
as
he
shut
the
door
,
in
adeep
whisper,--"he
's
with
him
.
<EOS>
""Who!--Philip
Frewin
?
"
demanded
Abel
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
ay
,
"
replied
Jacob
:
"
Philip
Frewin
,
and
his
attorney
,
Mr.
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
striding
along
the
passage
,
he
threw
open
the
door
,
and
bellowed
out"Mr
.
<EOS>
Abel
Beechcroft
.
<EOS>
"This
unlooked
-
for
announcement
,
followed
by
the
entrance
of
the
old
man
,
whose
stern
features
were
charged
with
a
menacing
expression
,
and
whodid
not
remove
his
hat
,
caused
the
utmost
surprise
and
consternationamong
the
trio
.
<EOS>
The
miser
was
seated
at
the
table
,
listening
to
a
clausein
a
legal
instrument
which
had
been
drawn
up
by
Diggs
,
who
was
readingit
to
him
,
but
who
instantly
stopped
on
hearing
the
name
of
his

<EOS>
Philip
,
whose
back
was
to
the
door
,
turned
round
in
some
confusion
;
andthe
miser
,
though
greatly
disconcerted
,
made
an
effort
to
commandhimself
,
and
said
,
in
a
voice
of
forced
politeness
,
though
suppressedrage,--"May
I
ask
to
what
I
am
to
attribute
the
honour
of
this
mostunexpected
visit
,
Mr.
Beechcroft?""You
will
attribute
it
solely
to
the
interest
I
take
in
your
daughter'swelfare
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
preserve
her
from
the
artsof
a
scoundrel
,
to
whom
you
are
about
to
consign
her
.
<EOS>
""You
are
not
perhaps
aware
in
whose
presence
you
stand
,
Mr.
Beechcroft?"cried
Philip
,
rising
and
furiously
regarding
him
.
<EOS>
"I
believe
you
are
Mr.
Philip
Frewin
,
the
very
person
I
referred
to,"replied
Abel
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
am
to
understand
you
applied
the
opprobrious
term
you
have
justused
to
me
?
"
cried
Philip
.
<EOS>
"Most
distinctly
!
"
rejoined
Abel
:
"
and
I
am
willing
to
repeat
it
--
<EOS>
tostrengthen
it
--
<EOS>
if
you
desire
it
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
,
you
shall
render
me
an
account
for
this
insolence
,
"
cried
Philip
,
clapping
his
hand
to
his
side
,
and
betraying
by
the
movement
<EOS>
--
for
he
wasdisguised
in
his
tattered
apparel
--
that
he
was
accustomed
to
carry
asword
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
the
law
deal
with
him
,
my
good
sir
,
"
interrupted
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
afair
ground
of
action
for
defamation
.
<EOS>
As
a
professional
man
,
I
warn
youto
take
heed
what
you
say
of
my
respectable
client
,
Mr.
Beechcroft
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
and
your
'
respectable
client
'
will
pursue
whatever
course
you
thinkproper
,
"
replied
Abel
;
"
but
do
not
imagine
your
menaces
will
prevent
mefrom
disclosing
the
truth
to
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
have
come
to
defame
my
nephew
to
me
,
Mr.
Beechcroft
,
your
errandwill
be
fruitless
,
"
said
the
miser
,
who
had
by
this
time
fully
recoveredhis
composure
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
decline
hearing
anything
you
have
to
say
.
<EOS>
Afterwhat
passed
between
us
,
years
ago
,
I
am
surprised
you
should
come
hereat
all
;
and
I
am
still
more
surprised
that
you
have
obtained
admittance
,
which
you
certainly
would
not
have
done
if
my
inclinations
had
beenconsulted
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
I
am
no
longer
master
of
my
own
house
,
or
of
myown
servants
.
<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
,
"
said
Abel
,
in
a
commanding
tone
,
and
with
a
look
that
madethe
miser
quail
,
"
I
have
been
called
upon
--
solemnly
called
upon
--
to
takethis
step
.
<EOS>
You
well
know
the

I
entertain
of
you
,
and
theabhorrence
in
which
I
hold
you
--
and
that
nothing
would
have
brought
menear
you
but
a
matter
of
the
utmost
urgency
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
called
upon
,
Irepeat
,
by
an
appeal
which
I
could
not
resist,"--his
voice
slightlytrembled,--"to
befriend
your
daughter
;
and
,
at
the
sacrifice
of
allpersonal
consideration
,
I
will
befriend
her
.
<EOS>
She
herself
has
told
me
shehas
the
strongest
dislike
to
your
nephew
,
and
never
will
marry
him
.
<EOS>
""All
<EOS>
this
may
be
very
true
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
"
but
I
am
at
a
lossto

yourself
up

<EOS>
""He
has
no

legal

so

interposedDiggs
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
shall
assume
it
,
then
,
"
replied
Abel
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
,
if

I

""Let

Diggs

taking
up

hasty

""Mr

the

You
can
not

<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
am
free
to
admit
that
you
are
incapable

advancing
adeliberate
falsehood

and
I
therefore
believe
that
you

But
you
are
completely
deceived

some

<EOS>
Mr.
Philip
Frewin
isa
careful
and
a

man
--
far
too
careful
to
please
you
--
and
has
,
ina
few
years

saved
a

<EOS>
This

his

<EOS>
Mr.

is
worth

I
have

I
agree

Mr.

Mr.

be
the
dupe

But
I

<EOS>
""You
will

convince

incredulously

<EOS>
"
Meantime
,
I
am
satisfied

therefore
adhere

I
also
give

Mr.

<EOS>
You
say
that
Mr.

is
wealthy

that
you
havedeeds

proving
him
worth

<EOS>
Let

""There

""If

I
can
have
no
objection,"replied
Diggs

readily
,
yet
with
a
certain
uneasiness
;
"
but
I
am
<EOS>
grievedto

such
a

<EOS>
""Circumstances

<EOS>
""Undoubtedly

Philip

I
will
not
rest

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
to
reduce

said
Abel

sternly

"
Ideclare
you

<EOS>
I
charge

<EOS>
As

"Mr

<EOS>
Beechcroft
may
appear
very
disinterested

saidPhilip
;
"
but
in
my
opinion
the
main
object
of
his
interference
is
toobtain
my

hand
for
his

<EOS>
""So
far
from
that
being

I

unlocked

came
down

he
was
about

depart

when
the
door
was
again
opened
by
Jacob

admitting
Cordwell
Firebras

It
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
the

comers

thoseto

they
were
introduced

were
the
most
surprised

<EOS>
Amid

however

Randulph
contrived
to
approach
Hilda

"I
fear

he
said--"indeed

permit

""No

Hilda

indifference

""Yet
<EOS>
hear
my
explanation

pursued
the
young

<EOS>
"
The

a
consummate
rascal
,
and
it
is
well
<EOS>
you
arerid
of
him
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Abel
Beechcroft
,
I
did
not
expect
to
meet
you
here
,
butyour
presence
is
singularly
opportune
.
<EOS>
""For
<EOS>
what
,
sir
?
"
demanded
Abel
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
to
come
to
some
arrangement
respecting
a
matter
in
which
thehappiness
of
your
nephew
is
materially
concerned
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
Ihope
,
sir
,
if
these
young
people
,
"
pointing
to
Randulph
and
Hilda
,
"
canunderstand
each
other
,
you
will
throw
no
obstacle
in
the
way
.
<EOS>
And
you
,
friend
Scarve
,
"
he
added
,
turning
to
the
miser
,
"
I
counsel
you
to
placethis
young
man
in
the
position
of
your
nephew
.
<EOS>
He
will
make
her
a
farbetter
husband
,
<EOS>
and--
"
he
whispered
a
few
words
in
the
miser
's
ear
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
condition
,
I
presume
,
which
you
annex
to
the
union
is
,
that
mynephew
should
join
the
Jacobite
cause
,
Mr.
Firebras
,
"
demanded
Abel
.
<EOS>
Firebras
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
it
not
so
,
Randulph
?
<EOS>
"
pursued
Abel
,
sternly
.
"Uncle
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
rushing
towards
him
,
and
flinging
himself
onhis
knee
before
him
,
"
I
love
Hilda
passionately
,
and
would
sacrifice
mylife
for
her!""But
<EOS>
not
,
I
hope
,
your
honour
,
"
replied
Abel
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Recollect
to
whomyou
owe
allegiance
.
<EOS>
Maintain
your
loyalty
unsullied
,
or
I
discard
you
.
<EOS>
""Be
<EOS>
not
too
hasty
,
sir
,
"
cried
Randulph
;
"
<EOS>
more
than
my
life
hangs
onyour
breath!""Randulph
Crew
,
"
said
the
miser
,
"
I
have
suffered
things
to
proceed
thusfar
without
interruption
,
because
I
have
been
taken
by
surprise
.
<EOS>
But
noimportunities
of
your
's
,
your
uncle
's
,
or
Mr.
Firebras
's
,
shall
prevailupon
me
to
consent
to
your
union
with
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
And
I
positivelyinterdict
you
from
seeing
her
again!""And
<EOS>
I
lay
the
same
injunction
upon
you
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
!
"
exclaimed
the
young
man
,
looking
at
her--"Hilda
!
"
<EOS>
But
sheaverted
her
gaze
.
<EOS>
"Come
with
me
,
"
cried
Abel
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
And
,
heaving
a
deep
sigh
,
Randulph
followed
his
uncle
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
,
"
said
Cordwell
Firebras
,
as
soon
as
they
were
left
alone--"youhave
<EOS>
lost
a
true
lover

<EOS>
you
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
have
lost
a

<EOS>
APPEARANCE
<EOS>
AFTER
HIS
DEBAUCH
--
<EOS>
HE
PROCEEDS
WITH
RANDULPH
<EOS>
TOLADY
BRABAZON'S
--
<EOS>
THE
PARTY
GO
TO
MARYLEBONE
GARDENS.Neither
Randulph
nor
his
uncle
felt
disposed
for
conversation
duringtheir
walk
to
Lambeth
,
whither
they
proceeded
on
quitting
the
miser'shabitation
;
and
,
in
fact
,
Abel
thought
it
desirable
to
let
the
eventsthat
had
just
occurred
work
their
own
effect
on
his
nephew
's
mind
,
without
any
assistance
from
him
.
<EOS>
Half
an
hour
saw
them
home
,
and
Mr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
looked
from
one
to
the
other
,
as
if
anxious
to
learn
why
theyreturned
together
;
but
he
received
no
information
.
<EOS>
They
found
Trussellin
the
breakfast
-
room
,
reclining
in
an
easy
-
chair
,
sipping
a
cup
of
coldgreen
tea
,
to
tranquillise
his
nerves
,
and
reading
the
fashionablemovements
and
intelligence
in
a
morning
paper
,
by
the
aid
of
a
pair
ofspectacles
,
which
he
hastily
took
off
on
hearing
their
approach
.
<EOS>
He
hadon
a
loose
brocade
dressing
-
gown
,
a
crimson
silk
night
-
cap
,
slippersdown
at
the
heel
,
and
ungartered
hose
hanging
loosely
about
his
legs
.
<EOS>
Altogether
,
he
had
a
very
rakish
and
dissolute
appearance
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
werered
and
inflamed
,
and
his
face
flushed
with
the
previous
night'sdebauch
.
<EOS>
An
open
note
lay
beside
him
on
the
table
,
with
a
coronet
on
theseal
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
with
an
air
of
fashionable
languor
as
his
brother
andnephew
entered
the
room
,
and
asked
,
yawningly
,
where
they
had
been
,
butreceiving
no
answer
,
jumped
up
,
and
repeated
the
inquiry
with
realinterest
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
ask
,
brother
,
"
replied
Abel
,
significantly--"Let
<EOS>
it
suffice
thatall
is
now
right
.
<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
"
though
I
do
n't
know
what
hasbeen
wrong
.
<EOS>
I
've
just
received
a
note
from
Lady
Brabazon
,
Randulph
,
inviting
us
to
accompany
her
to
Marylebone
Gardens
this
afternoon
.
<EOS>
Youknow
we
are
engaged
to
dine
with
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
.
<EOS>
""Go
to
the
gardens
,
by
all
means
,
"
said
uncle
Abel
,
<EOS>
kindly--"it
willserve
to
distract
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
""I
ventured
to
answer
for
you
,
Randulph
,
"
pursued
Trussell
,
"
becausethere
is
a
fete
there
to
-
day
,
and
you
are
sure
to
be
much
amused
.
<EOS>
You'llfind
Marylebone
very
different
from
the
Folly
--
ha
!
ha!""Only
folly
under
a
different
name
,
and
in
a
richer
garb
--
that
's
all,"laughed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I'll
now
go
and
dress
,
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Lady
Brab
has
sent
us
asubscription
-
ticket
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
a
silver
medal
,
about
thesize
of
a
modern
ivory
opera
-
ticket
,
or
"
bone
,
"
stamped
with
designs
<EOS>
inbold
bas
-
relief
,
numbered
,
and
inscribed
"
Marylebone
--
<EOS>
Admit
Two
,
"
withthe
date
,
1744.Abel
<EOS>
took
up
the
ticket
,
glanced
at
it
,
and
laid
it
down
with
a
smile
.
<EOS>
Randulph
made
an
excuse
for
retiring
to
his
own
room
,
and
on
reachingit
,
threw
himself
into
a
chair
to
indulge
his
reflections
;
and
,
bitterand
crushing
they
were
:
till
within
the
last
hour
,
when
he
fullybelieved
he
had
lost
her
for
ever
,
he
had
not
known
the
extent
of
hispassion
for
Hilda
.
<EOS>
Now
he
felt
--
as
all
who
have
loved
deeply
have
felton
<EOS>
some
such
occasion
--
that
his
existence
had
become
a
blank
to
him
<EOS>
,
andthat
he
should
never
be
entirely
happy
again
.
<EOS>
Again
and
again
hereproached
himself
for
his
folly
in
respect
to
Kitty
Conway
;
and
healmost
resolved
,
like
Uncle
Abel
,
to
forswear
a
sex
that
occasioned
himso
much
torment
.
<EOS>
A
tap
at
the
door
aroused
him
from
his
meditations
,
andMr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
entering
,
informed
him
that
his
uncle
Trussell
was
ready
,
andwaiting
for
him
.
<EOS>
Randulph
said
he
would
be
down
in
a
moment
;
and
,
makingsome
slight
change
in
his
attire
,
which
he
scarcely
thought
suitable
tothe
gay
scene
<EOS>
he
was
about
to
join
,
descended
,
and
found
his
uncle
inthe
hall
,
fully
equipped
in
a
snuff
-
coloured
velvet
coat
,
laced
ruffles
,
diamond
buckles
,
a
well
powdered
bag
-
wig
,
and
a
silver
hilted
sword
.
<EOS>
Trussell
appeared
rather
impatient
,
and
declared
they
were
behind
time;and
he
proceeded
at
a
rapid
pace
to
the
stairs
near
Lambeth
Palace
,
where
he
called
a
boat
,
directing
the
waterman
to
row
as
quickly
as
hecould
to
Whitehall
Stairs
--
the
nearest
point
to
Pall
Mall
,
where
LadyBrabazon
's
magnificent
house
was
situated
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
they
were
gone
,
Abel
summoned
Mr.
Jukes
,
and
having
partaken
of
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
ofwine
,
ordered
the
butler
to
prepare
to
attend
him
to
Marylebone
Gardens
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
Jukes
,
who
was
well
enough
pleased
by
the
proposed
expedition
,
madeas
little
delay
as
was
consistent
with
his
dignity
;
and
having
deliveredfull
instructions
to
the
under
-
servant
respecting
dinner
,
presentedhimself
in
a
well
-
powdered
bob
-
major
wig
,
a
well
-
brushed
brown
coat
,
white
waistcoat
,
and
black
velvets
;
and
what
with
his
round
rosy
face
,
his
swag
paunch
,
and
shapeless
legs
,
looked
the
model
of
awell
-
considered
,
well
-
fed
,
and
most
respectable
servant
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
thebutler
,
Abel
proceeded
to
Lambeth
Stairs
,
where
,
as
luck
would
have
it
,
the
ferryboat
chanced
to
be
crossing
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
they
gotinto
it
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
transported
,
together
with
a
crowd
ofpassengers
of
both
sexes
,
and
no
less
than
six
horses
,
in
safety
to
theopposite
side
of
the
river
.
<EOS>
At
the
corner
of
Abingdon
-
street
they
founda
coach
,
which
Abel
instantly
engaged
,
and
got
into
it
,
while
Mr.
Jukeswith
some
difficulty
clambered
up
the
box
.
<EOS>
They
then
drove
along
theHorseferry
Road
,
passed
at
the
back
of
Buckingham
House
,
and
proceededalong
Hyde
Park
to
their
destination
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Trussell
and
Randulph
having
arrived
at
Lady
's
Brabazon's
,
were
ushered
into
a
magnificently
-
furnished
drawing
-
room
,
where
theyfound
Beau
Villiers
,
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
Clementina
,
and
her
ladyship;by
the
latter
of
whom
they
were
very
graciously
received
.
<EOS>
Whenever
LadyBrabazon
,
indeed
--
mature
coquette
as
she
was
--
was
determined
to
please
,
she
seldom
failed
in
accomplishing
her
purpose
;
and
she
directed
herartillery
with
such
tact
and
skill
on
the
present
occasion
thatRandulph
,
armed
as
he
conceived
himself
against
such
attacks
,
was
notquite
proof
against
her
.
<EOS>
It
was
quite
evident
,
whether
her
feelings
wereinterested
or
not
in
the
conquest
,
that
she
was
determined
to
captivatethe
young
man
.
<EOS>
This
was
so
apparent
,
that
a
slight
feeling
of
jealousywas
roused
in
the
breast
of
the
beau
,
and
he
somewhat
abruptly
intimatedhis
intention
of
giving
up
a
drive
to
Richmond
,
which
he
had
meditated
,
and
of
accompanying
them
,
instead
,
to
Marylebone
Gardens
.
<EOS>
This
change
ofplan
was
not
altogether
to
her
ladyship
's
taste
;
but
she
affected
to
bedelighted
with
him
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
-
the
-
bye
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
said
she
to
Randulph
,
"
you
must
attend
my
Drumto
-
morrow
night
.
<EOS>
I
have
asked
the
new
beauty
whom
Villiers
hasdiscovered
--
<EOS>
I
mean
<EOS>
old
Mr.
Scarve
,
the
miser
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
She
's
perfectlycharming
,
Villiers
says
--
<EOS>
but
I
forget
;
<EOS>
I
need
not
describe
her
,
for
youhave
<EOS>
seen
her
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
,
I
have
called
a
blush
to
your
cheeks
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha!don't
you
envy
him
his
power
of
blushing
,
Villiers
?
<EOS>
Mr.
TrussellBeechcroft
,
I
suspect
your
nephew
is
in
love
with
Miss
Scarve
.
<EOS>
See
howhe
crimsons
at
the
mention
of
her
name
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ladyship
forgets
that
my
nephew
is
but
newly
imported
from
thecountry
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
He
is
not
accustomed
to
the
raillery
ofpersons
of
your
ladyship
's
wit
.
<EOS>
""There
's
something
more
than
bashfulness
in
his
confusion
,
"
replied
LadyBrabazon
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Crew
is
smitten
by
Miss
Scarve
--
let
him
deny
it
if
hecan
.
<EOS>
And
so
for
that
matter
is
Villiers
.
<EOS>
""I
'
faith
,
am
I
,
"
replied
the
beau
;
"
and
if
her
father
will
give
herfifty
thousand
pounds
,
which
I
know
he
can
do
,
I
will
make
her
a
presentof
my
name
and
person
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
do
n't
think
it
necessary
to
ask
the
young
lady
's
consent
?
<EOS>
"
saidRandulph
,
scarcely
able
to
conceal
his
displeasure
.
<EOS>
"Assuredly
<EOS>
not
,
"
replied
the
beau
,
with
a
self
-
sufficient
smile
,
whichRandulph
thought
<EOS>
perfectly
intolerable--"I
fancy
<EOS>
I
'm
pretty
certain
ofthat
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
see
you
've
no
chance
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
laughed
Lady
Brabazon,--"your
onlyresource
is
to
get
some
other
fair
dame
or
damsel
to
take
compassion
onyou
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
ladyship
,
for
example
,
"
said
the
beau
,
in
a
sarcastic
andsignificant
whisper
:
"
but
the
young
man
does
n't
seem
disposed
to
takethe
hint
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
's
thoughts
,
indeed
,
were
elsewhere
at
the
moment
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
I
suspect
Miss
Scarve
wo
n't
turn
out
half
so
beautiful
as
Mr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
represents
her
,
"
said
Clementina
,
who
could
n't
hear
to
hear
anyother
beauty
spoken
of
except
her
own,--"I've
generally
beendisappointed
in
the
objects
of
his
admiration
,
and
make
no
doubt
shewill
be
like
the
rest
of
them
--
very
common
-
place
and
very
vulgar
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
is
neither
one
nor
the
other
,
"
said
Randulph
,
with
some
vivacity
.
<EOS>
"Didn't
<EOS>
I
tell
you
he
was
in
love
with
her
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Lady
Brabazon
,
screaming
with
laughter
,
to
shew
her
brilliant
teeth
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
refusedhim
,
and
that
accounts
for
his
dejection
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
's
cheeks
literally
burnt
with
shame
.
<EOS>
"Egad
!
<EOS>
Lady
Brab
,
I
believe
you
have
hit
the
right
nail
on
the
head
thistime
,
"
whispered
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
ladyship
is
a
little
too
hard
on
my
nephew
,
"
interposed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Spare
<EOS>
him
,
I
entreat
of
you
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
,
I
sha'n't
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Lady
Brabazon
:
"
he
must
learn
to
take
suchmatters
with
indifference
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
hope
we
shall
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
this
faircreature
,
"
said
<EOS>
Sir
Singleton,--"but
<EOS>
I
fear
her
father
wo
n't
let
hercome
.

I
'm
told
he
watches
her
like
a
green
dragon
.
<EOS>
""I've
asked
him
to
bring
her
,
"
said
Lady
Brabazon
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
know
he
won'trefuse
me
.
<EOS>
Shall
I
confess
it
to
you
,
Mr.

?
<EOS>
"
she
added
,
laying
hersmall
white
hand
on
his
arm
,
"
I
've
an
admirer
in
this
miser
,
whose
heartis
supposed
to
be
fixed
on
his

.
<EOS>
Is
not
that
a
triumph?""A
glorious
one

"
<EOS>
laughed
Trussell
;
"
but
I
do
n't
wonder
at
any
conqueston
the

your

<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
Mr.

should
propose
,
I
advise
your

to
accept
him,"said
the
beau
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
that
case

it
wo
n't
do
for
you
to
make
an
offer
to
his
daughter

Villiers

"
rejoined
Lady
Brabazon
;
"
for
I
shall
require
him
to
settleall
his
property
on
me
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
must
get
beforehand
with
you

"
said
the

,
"
<EOS>
for
I

her

<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
,
a
footman
entered
,
and
informed
Lady
Brabazon
<EOS>
that

<EOS>
He
was
followed
by

<EOS>
"I

taking

<EOS>
"

<EOS>
She
then
arose

andtaking
Randulph

and
quitting
the

proceeded

through

<EOS>
DEJECTED.Before
repairing
,
however
,
to
this
celebrated
place
of
entertainment
,
itwill
be
needful
to
inquire
into
the
proceedings
of
another
person
whoproposed
to
visit
it
--
<EOS>
namely
,
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Villiers
,
it
will
beremembered
,
had
intended
to
drive
over
to
Richmond
on
the
day
inquestion
--
to
fulfil
an
engagement
of
more
than
a
week
's
standing,--buthad
suddenly
,
from
jealousy
or
whim
,
changed
his
mind
.
<EOS>
Calculating
,
however
,
upon
his
master
's
adherence
to
his
original
plan
,
the
valet
haddetermined
to
profit
by
his
absence
to
visit
Marylebone
Gardens
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
,
it
has
been
shewn
,
was
a
very
great
person
in
his
ownestimation
;
but
he
sometimes
represented
himself
as
a
far
greater
personthan
he
had
any
title
to
be
considered
,
and
induing
himself
in
hismaster
's
clothes
,
laid
claim
also
to
his
master
's
title
;
in
other
words
,
sinking
the
vulgar
name
of
Cripps
,
he
would
assume
that
of
Villiers
.
<EOS>
Hisdisplays
of
this
kind
were
chiefly
confined
to
the
eastern
side
of
themetropolis
,
where
he
was
pretty
certain
not
to
meet
either
his
master
orhis
friends
;
his
principal
places
of
resort
being
White
Conduit
-
house
,
Sadler
's
Wells
,
Hockley
-
in
-
the
-
Hole
,
Islington
,
Hogsden
,
and
certainother
places
of
entertainment
on
the
Surrey
side
of
the
water
.
<EOS>
OneSunday
,
when
he
was
so
disporting
himself
at
White
Conduit
-
house
,
hecontrived
to
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
a
very
showy
dame
whohappened
to
be
there
,
and
who
was
dazzled
by
his
brilliant
exterior
andairy
manners
--
so
superior
,
she
thought
,
to
those
of
the
vulgar
throngaround
her
.
<EOS>
Having
attended
her
during
her
stay
,
Mr.
Cripps
called
acoach
for
her
,
led
her
to
it
,
and
was
rewarded
by
a
tender
look
and
atenderer
squeeze
of
the
hand
at
parting
.
<EOS>
He
had
previously
ascertainedthat
the
lady
's
name
was
Nettleship
,
that
she
was
the
relict
of
atallow
-
chandler
,
and
resided
in
Billiter
-
square
;
that
she
possessed
ahandsome
property
,
bequeathed
to
her
by
her
deceased
spouse
,
thetallow
-
chandler
aforesaid
;
and
moreover
,
that
she
was
withoutincumbrances
.
<EOS>
Fortune
thus
appeared
to
have
thrown
a
rich
prize
in
hisway
,
if
he
could
but
obtain
it
.
<EOS>
He
found
,
however
,
on
further
inquiry
,
that
Mrs.
Nettleship
was
under
a
marriage
engagement
to
her
latehusband
's
partner
,
Mr.
Rathbone
,
who
was
at
that
time
in
the
countrycollecting
debts
,
and
settling
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
But
though
this
circumstancecertainly
appeared
untoward
,
he
determined
to
persevere
,
being
firmlypersuaded
that
in
love
matters
to
dare
was
generally
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
Withthis
view
,
he
contrived
to
meet
Mrs.
Nettleship
as
often
as
he
could
,
and
had
been
exactly
half
a
dozen
times
in
her
company
prior
to
theopening
of
this
history
,
during
which
period
be
contrived
to
heightenthe
agreeable
impression
he
had
produced
on
their
first
acquaintance
,
and
in
a
great
degree
to
obliterate
the
image
of
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Nettleship
was
a
lady
rather
below
the
middle
size
,
but
notaltogether
destitute
of
personal
attractions
.
<EOS>
She
had
a
very
full
andvery
comely
figure
,
very
white
and
very
rounded
little
arms
,
with
pinkdimpling
elbows
;
and
though
she
had
no
neck
,
or
at
least
none
that
wasperceptible
,
from
the
wreaths
of
fat
above
and
below
it
,
she
had
cheekslarge
and
round
enough
to
make
up
for
the
deficiency
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
were
assmall
as
those
of
a
Chinese
lady
,
but
very
black
and
bright
--
<EOS>
brightenough
,
her
late
husband
used
to
say
,
'
to
light
a
candle
at
;
'
and
hernose
had
the
prettiest
turned
up
point
in
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
was
this
featurethat
,
in
especial
,
called
forth
the
descriptive
powers
of
Mr.
Cripps
,
who
appeared
in
a
state
of
ecstasy
whenever
he
contemplated
it
,
orthought
of
it
,
and
having
a
slightly
turned
up
nose
himself
,
contended
,
reasonably
enough
,
that
no
beauty
could
exist
without
such
a
formation
,
and
that
Grecian
noses
,
and
above
all
,
Roman
noses
,
were
detestable
,
andunendurable
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
to
bring
Mrs.
Nettleship
to
hisopinion
;
and
though
she
flustered
and
blushed
at
his
compliments
andfine
speeches
,
and
professed
to
think
them
too
extravagant
,
it
wasevident
she
swallowed
them
as
easily
as
if
they
had
been
strawberriesand
cream
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nettleship
was
at
an
age
when
,
more
than
any
other
,
suchcompliments
are
estimated
.
<EOS>
She
was
exactly
forty
-
five
,
and
she
thereforeknew
the
full
value
of
her
attractions
.
<EOS>
During
their
interviews
,
she
hadoften
expressed
a
strong
desire
to
visit
Ranelagh
,
Marylebone
Gardens
,
or
Vauxhall
,
in
company
with
her
admirer
,
but
Mr.
Cripps
constantlyevaded
the
request
,
under
some
plea
or
other
,
until
an
opportunityappeared
to
present
itself
,
occasioned
by
his
master
's
proposed
drive
toRichmond
,
and
he
resolved
to
hazard
a
visit
to
Marylebone
Gardens
withher
,
fervently
praying
it
might
decide
his
hopes
.
<EOS>
So
soon
,
therefore
,
as
the
coast
was
clear
,
he
repaired
to
his
master'sdressing
-
room
,
and
with
the
assistance
of
Antoine
,
the
French
valet
,
ransacked
the
wardrobe
,
and
attired
himself
in
the
richest
habilimentsit
contained
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
embroidered
scarlet
coat
,
the
flowered
silkwaistcoat
,
the
black
velvet
breeches
,
the
pearl
-
coloured
silk
hose
,
thathad
decorated
the
beau
's
own
person
on
the
previous
day
,
were
nowtransferred
to
his
own
.
<EOS>
To
these
he
added
one
of
his
master
's
finestlaced
shirts
,
and
a
point
-
lace
,
cravat
.
<EOS>
A
pair
of
large
diamond
buckleswere
fixed
to
his
shoes
,
and
a
silverhilted
sword
to
his
side
.
<EOS>
He
nextselected
a
large
and
brilliant
ring
from
the
beau
's
jewel
box
,
which
heplaced
upon
his
finger
;
covered
his
cheeks
and
chin
with
patches
;
put
ona
full
flowing
Ramillies
perriwig
;
thrust
a
magnificent
gold
snuff
-
boxinto
his
pocket
,
together
with
a
fine
cambric
handkerchief
;
chose
thehandsomest
clouded
cane
he
could
find
;
took
up
a
feathered
hat
which
hadonly
been
once
before
worn
by
his
master
,
and
which
he
himself
hadprevented
him
from
wearing
on
that
day
;
and
having
contemplated
himselfwith
great
complacency
in
the
large
cheval
-
glass
before
him
,
declared
toAntoine
that
he
thought
he
should
do!Receiving
<EOS>
a
confirmatory
reply
from
the
French
valet
,
he
went
down
aback
staircase
,
which
he
had
often
traversed
before
when
bent
on
similarexpeditions
,
and
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
A
coach
was
waiting
for
him
at
thecorner
of
Spring
Gardens
,
into
which
he
got
,
and
ordered
the
coachman
todrive
for
very
life
to
the
top
of
Harley
Street
,
where
he
had
appointedto
meet
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
and
where
,
in
fact
,
he
found
her
waiting
forhim
.
<EOS>
Discharging
his
own
vehicle
,
he
handed
the
lady
out
of
hers
;
andapologizing
to
her
for
having
detained
her
,
led
the
way
to
the
gardens
.
<EOS>
He
launched
out
in
an
eloquent
panegyric
on
her
dress
,
which
hedesignated
as
ravishing
,
predicting
its
effect
on
the
assemblage
theywere
about
to
join
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nettleship
had
,
indeed
,
taken
quite
as
muchpains
with
her
toilette
as
her
admirer
;
and
it
was
no
slightsatisfaction
to
her
to
find
her
efforts
appreciated
.
<EOS>
Her
gown
was
ofblue
and
silver
silk
of
the
richest
description
,
and
inflated
almost
tothe
size
of
a
balloon
by
an
enormous
hoop
.
<EOS>
She
wore
diamond
ear
-
rings
,
and
a
diamond
solitaire
,
while
her
neck
was
encircled
by
a
chain
oflarge
orient
pearls
.
<EOS>
Her
stomacher
was
spotted
with
plated
silver
,
andthickly
studded
with
Bristol
stones
.
<EOS>
Her
sleeves
were
short
and
wide
,
tied
above
the
elbow
with
white
satin
bows
,
and
edged
with
deep
falls
oflace
,
her
cap
was
of
pink
silk
,
and
caul
-
shaped
,
and
from
behind
itfloated
two
streamer
-
like
crimson
ribands
.
<EOS>
Her
ruddy
complexion
,
whichneeded
no
aid
of
rouge
,
was
relieved
by
abundance
of
patches
,
while
herlittle
fat
fingers
,
rosy
as
those
of
Aurora
,
pept
from
out
a
pair
ofshort
black
silk
gloves
.
<EOS>
A
large
fan
,
then
as
indispensable
to
a
lady
asa
sword
to
a
gentleman
,
completed
her
appointments
.
<EOS>
Marylebone
Gardens
,
it
is
well

known
,
lay
on
the
eastern
side
of
theupper
end
of
the
lane
bearing
the
same
name
--
the
whole
of
the
countrybeyond
Harley
Street
,
which
was
not
more
than
a
third
of
its
presentextent
,
being
open
fields
.
<EOS>
They
were
of
considerable
size
,
and
wereoriginally
laid
out
and
planted
at
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
,
atwhich
time
the
public
were
gratuitously
admitted
to
them
.
<EOS>
In
one
part
ofthe
grounds
there
was
an
excellent
bowling
green
;
which
drew
many
loversof
that
most
agreeable
recreation
to
it
.
<EOS>
By
degrees
,
the
gardens
beingvery
conveniently
situated
,
rose
in
repute
;
and
in
1737
,
theirproprietor
,
Mr.
Gough
,
began
to
demand
a
shilling
for
admittance
--
thissum
entitling
the
visitor
to
its
value
in
refreshments
.
<EOS>
But
stillfurther
improvements
were
effected
.
<EOS>
Orchestras
,
boxes
,
and
a
theatre
formusical
entertainments
,
were
erected
within
them
.
<EOS>
Besides
the
mainwalks
,
semicircular
rows
of
trees
were
planted
,
and
hedges
contrived
soas
to
form
pleasing
labyrinths
for
those
who
preferred
privacy
.
<EOS>
Bowers
,
and
alcoves
were
built
in
different
places
;
lamps
were
fastened
to
thetrees
,
and
at
night
,
on
the
occasion
of
a
fete
,
every
part
of
the
gardenwas
illuminated
with
myriads
of
lamps
of
various
colours
.
<EOS>
The
companybegan
to
improve
,
and
the
price
of
admission
was
raised
to
fiveshillings
.
<EOS>
Fetes
of
every
kind
were
held
here
;
and
the
place
continuedin
vogue
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
century
with
which
its
risecommenced
.
<EOS>
In
Marylebone
gardens
stood
the
notorious
gambling
house
towhich
John
Sheffield
,
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
used
to
repair
,
and
who
at
theclose
of
the
dinner
with
which
he
was
wo
nt
to
wind
up
the
season
,
gaveas
a
toast--"May
<EOS>
as
many
of

as

unhanged
meet
next
spring
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Itwas
in
allusion
to
this
duke
,
and
to
his
haunt
,
that
Lady
Mary
WortleyMontague
wrote:--"Some

<EOS>
"Malcolm

a

in

But

<EOS>
Carriages
,
coaches
,
and
chairs
were
setting
down
their
occupants
at
theentrance
to
the
gardens
,
as
Mr.
Cripps
and
his
companion
drew
near
.
<EOS>
Never
had
Mrs.
Nettleship
seen
a
gayer
throng
--
the
dresses

thoughtmagnificent
.
<EOS>
There
was
Lady
Ancaster
,
whom
Mr.
Cripps
pointed
out
toher
,
in
a
brocaded
lutestring
sack
,
with
ruby

coloured

and
whitetobine

trimmed
with

Lady

<EOS>
All
these
ladies
wore
hoops

but
none
of
them
,
Mr.
Cripps
assured
hiscompanion
,
managed
this
equipment
with
half
so
much
grace
as
herself
.
<EOS>
Throughout
this
stage
of
the
business
,
Mr.
Cripps
had
some
difficulty
inplaying
his
part
,
and
it
required
all
his
effrontery
to
enable
him
to
gothrough
with
it
.
<EOS>
Having
affirmed
to
his

that
he

inthe
habit

he
was

the
character
,

he
kept
constantly
bowing

his
hand
to
them

<EOS>
And
in
most
cases
he
succeeded
;
for
the

his

enchanted
.
<EOS>
To
be
attended
by
so
fashionable
a
person
,
who
knew
allthe
beau
monde
,
was
supreme
felicity
.
<EOS>
She
would
have
given
the
world
tobe
introduced
to
some
of
the
fashionable
ladies
,
and
intimated
as
muchto
her
companion
;
but
he
was
too
shrewd
to
attend
to
the
suggestion
,
contenting
himself
with
saying
,
with
a
very
impassioned
look
,
"
I
hope
,
my
angel
,
that
one
of
these
days
,
I
shall
have
the
honour

Mr.

,
how
you

"
exclaimed
the
lady
,
spreading
her
fan
before
her
face
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
they
had
gained
the
principal
avenue
leading
towards
theorchestra
,
and
at
each
step
he
took
,
Mr.
Cripps
kissed
his
hand
to
someelegantly
dressed
person:--"There
's
my
friend
Lord
Effingham
and
hiscountess
,
"
he
said--"glad
to
see
you
,
my
lord
--
that
's
the
pretty
Mrs

Rackham
--
a
bride
,

,
a

"
with
tender
emphasis--"that'sthe

Mrs.

<EOS>
--
I
dare

for
she
's
determined

tohave

whether
I

no

<EOS>
and
I
ca
n't
make

thoughshe
's
promised
to
settle
sixty
thousand
pounds
upon
me
,
and
to
die
insix
months
.
<EOS>
""La
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Willars
,
you
would
n't
sell
yourself
to
such
an
ojus
creature
asthat
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mrs.
Nettleship--"why
<EOS>
,
she
's
a
perfect
fright
,
so
dressed!""Precisely
what
you
describe
her

"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
"
<EOS>
But
dolisten
to
the
music
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
it
<EOS>
inspiring?"And
<EOS>
they
paused
for
a
moment
to
listen
to
the
lively
strains
proceedingfrom
the
orchestra
,
which
was
placed
at
one
end
of
a
large
buildingfacing
the
principal
walk
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
company
had
almost
entirelyassembled
.
<EOS>
The
main
walk
was
completely
thronged
,
and
presented
theappearance
of
the
Mall
at
high
tide
,
while
all
the
boxes
and
alcoveswere
filled
with
persons
discussing
bowls
of
punch
,
plates
of
ham
,
chickens
,
salads
,
and
other
good
things
.
<EOS>
The
band
in
the
orchestra
wasexcellent
,
and
the
lively
airs
and
symphonies
added
to
the
excitementand
spirit
of
the
scene
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
created
a
great
sensation
.
<EOS>
Manypersons
thought
they
had
seen
him
before
,
but
no
one
could
tell
who
hewas
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
object
of
this
attention
continued
to
dispense
hisbows
and
smiles
,
flourished
his
clouded
cane
,
tapped
his
magnificentsnuff
-
box
,
and
after
astonishing
all
the
beholders
with
his
coxcombry
,
glided
off
with
his
companion
into
one
of
the
side
walks
.
<EOS>
He
had
scarcely
disappeared
when
Lady
Brabazon
and
her
party
entered
themain
walk
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
led
her
little
spaniel
by
its
string
,
and
wasattended
on
one
side
by
the
beau
,
and
on
the
other
by
Trussell
.
<EOS>
Behindthem
walked
Clementina
,
who
had
contrived
to
allure
Randulph
from
hermother
,
and
to
attach
him
to
her
,
while
on
the
young
man
's
left
walkedSir
Singleton
Spinke
.
<EOS>
Everybody
that
Mr.
Villiers
encountered
told
him
of
the
prodigious
beauwho
had
just
been
seen
on
the
walk
.
<EOS>
Lord
Effingham
,
Major
Burrowes
,
LordDyneover
,
Sir
John
Fagg
--
all
described
him
.
"Who
<EOS>
the
devil
is
he
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Villiers
.
<EOS>
"Haven't
the
least
idea
,
"
replied
Sir
John
Fagg
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
'll
speak
to
himif
I
meet
him
again
.
<EOS>
He
's
your
very
double
,
Villiers
.
<EOS>
I
'll
swear
he
hasemployed
Desmartins
to
make
him
a
suit
precisely
like
your
own
.
<EOS>
""Has
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
beau
,
indignantly
"
Then
I
'll
never
employ
a
rascallyFrenchman
again
!
<EOS>
and
what
is
more
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
pay
him
his
bill
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
same
thing
was
told
him
by
twenty
other
persons
,
and
the
beau
lookedanxiously
round
for
his
personator
,
but
was
for
some
time
unable
todiscover
him
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Cripps
had
sought
this
secluded
walk
to
give
him
anopportunity
of
making
a
declaration
to
the
widow
,
and
though
he
was
notpositively
accepted
,
he
was
not
decidedly
refused
--
the
lady
only
askingtime
to
consider
over
the
proposal
.
<EOS>
The
audacious
valet
was
on
hisknees
,
and
rapturously
kissing
her
hand
,
vowing
he
would
never
rise
tillhe
had
a
favorable
answer
to
his
suit
,
when
two
persons
were
seenapproaching
,
whom
,
to
his
infinite
mortification
and
surprise
,
herecognised
as
Abel
Beechcroft
and
his
uncle
,
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"We
are
interrupted
,
my
charmer
,
"
he
cried
,
getting
up
,
with
acountenance
of
angry
dismay--"Let
us
return
to
the
public
promenade
.
<EOS>
Youwon't
refuse
me
.
<EOS>
I
shall
kill
myself
'
pon
rep
,
if
you
do!""I'll
think
of
it
,
Mr.
Willars
,
"
said
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
twirling
her
fan
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
it
would
be
a
dreadful
thing
if
I
was
to
break
my
engagement
to
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
curse
Mr.
Rathbone
,
I
'll
cut
his
throat
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.
Cripps
,
glancing
anxiously
down
the
walk
.
<EOS>
But
unfortunately
,
there
was
no
outletat
the
lower
end
,
and
he
was
compelled
to
turn
and
face
the
intruders
.
<EOS>
He
looked
also
to
the
right
and
left
,
but
on
neither
side
was
there
abox
or
an
arbour
into
which
he
could
retreat
.
<EOS>
Nothing
was
left
for
itbut
impudence
,
and
luckily
for
him
this
quality
never
deserted
him
at
apinch
.
<EOS>
Putting
on
his
boldest
manner
,
he
strutted
gaily
,
and
withaffected
nonchalance
towards
Abel
,
and
his
uncle
,
who
,
as
he
advanced
,
stepped
aside
a
little
to
look
at
him
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
as
I
live
<EOS>
!
"
cried
Abel
,
"
that
's
Mr.
Villiers
's
valet
--
your
nephew
,
Jukes
.
<EOS>
""Lord
save
us
!
<EOS>
so
it
is

"
cried
Mr.

,
lifting
up
his
hands
inastonishment
.
<EOS>
"
Why

said
Mr.

,
angrily
,
"
and
let

<EOS>
""What

<EOS>
disown

"
<EOS>
cried
Mr.

,
angrily
,
"
and
in

of

.
<EOS>
Pay

the

yesterday

<EOS>
""La

<EOS>
Mr.

,
what
's
the

all
this

"
cried
Mrs

Nettleship
.
<EOS>
"'Pon

"
replied
Mr.

.
<EOS>
"
The
rack
punch
has
evidently
got
intohis

,
and
made
him
mistake
one

<EOS>
""Rack

cried
Mr.

furiously
.
<EOS>
"
I

he
added
to
Mrs.

<EOS>
He

<EOS>
""A

cried
Mr.

,
raising
his
cane
,
"
or
I
'll
chastise

""Chastise

the

angrily

you'll
certainly

<EOS>
""Let
<EOS>
him
alone
,
Jukes
,
"
interposed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
'll
meet
his
master
at
thecorner
of
the
walk
,
and
I
should
like
to
see
how
he
'll
carry
it
off
.
<EOS>
"Taking
<EOS>
advantage
of
the
interference
,
Mr.
Cripps
passed
on
with
hisinamorata
,
who
was
as
anxious
to
escape
from
the
scene
as
himself
;
whileAbel
and
Mr.
Jukes
followed
them
at
a
short
distance
.
<EOS>
It
fell
out
as
Abel
had
foreseen
.
<EOS>
As
Mr.
Cripps
issued
into
the
broadwalk
right
before
him
,
and
not
many
yards
off
,
were
his
master
and
LadyBrabazon
,
together
with
the
rest
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
If
the
valet
ever
hadneed
of
assurance
,
it
was
now
.
<EOS>
But
though
ready
to
sink
into
the
earth
,
he
was
true
to
himself
,
and
exhibited
no
outward
signs
of
discomposure
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
he
drew
forth
his
snuff
-
box
,
took
a
pinch
,
in
hisairiest
manner
,
and
said
to
Mrs.
Nettleship--"There
's
LadyBrabazon
--
accounted
one
of
the
finest
women
of
the
day
,
but
upon
mysoul
,
she
's
not
to
be
compared
with
you
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
he
made
a
profound
salutation
to
Lady
Brabazon
,
who
lookedpetrified
with
astonishment
,
and
kissed
his
hand
to
Trussell
,
who
wasready
to
die
with
laughing
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
beau
,
he
grasped
his
cane
in
amanner
that
plainly
betokened
his
intention
of
laying
it
across
hisvalet
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
But
the
latter
,
divining
his
intention
,
and
seeingthat
nothing
but
a
bold
manouvre
could
now
save
him
,
strutted
up
to
him
,
and
said
in
a
loud
voice--"Ah
!
<EOS>
my
dear
fellow
--
how
d'ye
do

<EOS>
glad
to

,
in

tone--"For

<EOS>
Villiers
regarded
him
in
astonishment
,
mixed
with
some
littleadmiration
;
and
at
length
his
good
nature
got
the
better
of
his
anger
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
get
you
gone
instantly
,
"
he
said;--"if

""Good

"
replied
Mr.
Cripps--"I'll
not
forget

"
<EOS>
Andwith
a
profound
bow
,
he
moved
off
with
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
,
you
have
let
him
off

"
cried
Lady
Brabazon
,
in
amazement
.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
my

I
could

replied
the

<EOS>
"
I

the
morning
succeeding
the
visit
to
Marylebone
Gardens
,
commemoratedin
the
preceding
chapter
,
as
Trussell
and
Randulph
sat
together
afterbreakfast
,
the
latter
communicated
to
his
uncle
what
had
occurred
at
themiser
's
the
day
before

besought
him
to
give

a

obtainingHilda

<EOS>
"I
wish
I
could
do
so
,
Randulph
<EOS>

"
replied
Trussell
,
who
had
questionedhim
particularly
as
to
the

's
deportment
and
manner
during
theinterview
;
"
but
<EOS>
I
do
n't
see

<EOS>
Were
it
an

,
I
should
say
,
go
on
--
make
the

<EOS>
Difficulties
,
especially
inlove
matters
,
are
always
to
be
overcome
by
perseverance
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
notso
here
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
you
have
forfeited
the

andthough
that
might
be
set
to
rights
,
if
you
had
an
opportunity
for
fullexplanation

as

stand

it

Then
--
what

--
<EOS>
her

deeply

"If

from

over

nice
sense

"
pursued
Trussell
,
"
you
had
not
given
your

your

you
might
have
had
Hilda
for
asking
.
<EOS>
""Were

I

""Nay

replied
Trussell

I
thinkyour

singularly
honourable

disinterested

not

But
in

this

upon

<EOS>
The
two

set

<EOS>
so

evenif

taking
a
turn
round

"
Is
there
no

remark
brought
to
his
mind
<EOS>
CordwellFirebras
's
proposal
,
with
which
his
uncle
was
wholly
unacquainted
.
<EOS>
Ameans
of
obtaining
Hilda
's
hand
through
the
influence
of
this
man
,
presented
itself
to
him
.
<EOS>
But
he
rejected
the
idea
as
soon
as
conceived
.
<EOS>
"Jesting
<EOS>
apart
,
nephew
,
"
said
Trussell
,
who
had
noticed
his
confusion
,
but
attributed
it
to
a
different
cause
;
"
you
must
give
up
all
idea
ofHilda
.
<EOS>
She
is
a
charming
girl
,
no
doubt
;
but
she
is
not
the
onlycharming
girl
in
the
world
;
and
you
must
fall
in
love
with
some
one
elseas
quickly
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
It
seems
impossible
at
present
,
I
make
no
doubt
.
<EOS>
But
do
n't
despair
.
<EOS>
You
'll
get
over
your
disappointment
in
time
.
<EOS>
Why
notbegin
with
Lady
Brabazon
?
<EOS>
She
has
given
you
plenty
of
encouragement
;
andis
just
the
woman
to
initiate
you
into
the
ways
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
It
wouldbe
quite
worth
your
while
to
devote
yourself
to
her
for
a
season
;
and
bythis
means
you
will
gain
a
reputation
for
gallantry
,
which
is
verydesirable
for
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
such
ambition
,
uncle
,
<EOS>
"
replied
Randulph
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
isextremely
fascinating
,
but
my
heart
is
otherwise
engaged
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Trussell
,
"
we
do
n't
live
in
the
days
of
chivalry
andeternal
constancy
.
<EOS>
Men
are
no
longer
the
preux
chevaliers
they
used
tobe
.
<EOS>
Women
like
us
all
the
better
for
a
little
infidelity
.
<EOS>
They
fancywe're
better
worth
having
when
others
are
running
after
us
.
<EOS>
One
successleads
to
another
.
<EOS>
Nourish
,
if
you
please
,
a
secret
passion
for
Hilda
,
but
amuse
yourself
as
you
think
proper
,
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
If
it
answersno
other
purpose
,
it
will
prevent
you
from
doing
something
desperate
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
it
just
occurs
to
me
that
we
are
to
meet
your
lady
love
atthe
drum
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
Now
let
me
advise
you
how
to
act
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
the
counsel
could
be
given
,
Mr.
Jukes
entered
the
room
,
anddelivering
him
a
little
perfumed
billet
,
on
a
silver
waiter
,
departed
.
<EOS>
"From
Lady
Brab
herself
,
I
declare
,
"
cried
Trussell
,
glancing
at
thesuperscription
,
and
breaking
open
the
note
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
here
's
adisappointment

<EOS>
Old
Scarve
wo
n't
allow
his
daughter
to
attend
herladyship
's
drum
to
-
night
if
we
go
there
;
and
so
,
she
prays
us
to
dinewith
her
to
-
morrow
instead
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
thus
I
shall
miss
my
only
chance
of
seeing
Hilda
,
while
she
will
beexposed
to
the
assiduities
of
that
daring
impertinent
,
Beau
Villiers!"cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Very
<EOS>
true
,
"
said
Trussell
,
gravely
.
<EOS>
"I
wo
n't
receive
the
back
-
word
,
"
said
Randulph
;
"
I
'll
go
in
spite
of
herladyship
.
<EOS>
""Poh
!
<EOS>
poh
!
<EOS>
you
must
n't
think
of
such
a
thing
,
"
rejoined
Trussell
:
"
itwould
be
an
unheard
-
of
impropriety
;
and
you
would
only
expose
yourselfto
insult
.
<EOS>
It
's
devilish
unlucky
,
but
it
ca
n't
be
helped
.
<EOS>
I
've
pointedout
to
you
the
remedy
for
the
evil
.
<EOS>
Forget
Hilda
,
and
replace
her
imagewith
that
of
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
If
the
beau
robs
you
of
your
mistress
,
youcan
soon
be
even
with
him
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
And
now
,
since
the
plans
of
the
dayare
so
entirely
changed
,
suppose
we
go
into
the
city
,
and
see
some
ofthe
sights
there
,
and
afterwards
dine
at
one
of
the
coffee
-
houses
.
<EOS>
Whoknows
but
we
may
meet
with
some
adventure
which
may
completely
divertthe
current
of
your
thoughts
.
<EOS>
"Whatever
<EOS>
Randulph
might
think
of
the
probability
of
his
uncle
's
notionbeing
realised
,
he
acquiesced
in
the
suggestion
;
and
,
not
long
afterthis
,
they
sallied
forth
,
and
taking
a
boat
at
the
Palace
-
stairs
,
rowedto
the
Tower
,
near
which
they
were
landed
.
<EOS>
Conversant
with
every
objectof
interest
in
the
old
fortress
,
Trussell
proved
an
excellent
guide
tohis
nephew
,
and
they
spent
some
hours
in
examining
its
variousfortifications
,
and
in
talking
over
its
historical
recollections
,
aswell
as
in
visiting
its
armories
and
its
lions
,
and
such
matters
as
werethen
and
much
more
recently
exhibited
to
the
public
.
<EOS>
From
the
Tower
theyproceeded
to
the
Royal
Exchange
,
where
they
likewise
spent
some
time
.
<EOS>
Asthe
day
had
begun
to
draw
in
,
Trussell
proposed
an
adjournment
toKivat
's
coffee
-
house
,
<EOS>
where
,
he
averred
,
they
were
sure
of
a
good
dinnerand
excellent
wine
.
<EOS>
Randulph
assented
,
and
to
Kivat
's
they
repaired
.
<EOS>
Trussell
's
assertion
was
found
to
be
well
warranted
;
the
dinner
wascapital
,
and
the
claret
<EOS>
so
good
that
,
in
spite
of
his
nephew'sremonstrances
,
he
called
for
a
second
bottle
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
already
drankmore
than
he
was
accustomed
to
do
,
but
he
could
not
resist
the
bumperspressed
upon
him
by
his
jovial
uncle
,
who
assured
him
that
the
best
wayof
getting
rid
of
care
was
to
drown
it
in
the
glass
.
<EOS>
A
third
bottle
wascalled
for
,
and
disposed
of
;
and
Trussell
then
ordered
a
coach
,
andprivately
instructed
the
driver
to
take
them
to
the
Little
Theatre
inthe
Haymarket
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
there
,
they
were
shown
,
by
Trussell
's
desire
,
into
a
box
near
the
stage
;
and
as
they
entered
it
,
the
house
was
ringingwith
the
applauses
bestowed
on
a
song
which
had
just
been
executed
by
afemale
singer
.
<EOS>
The
reiterated
cries
of
encore
were
at
length
compliedwith
by
the
fair
object
of
them
,
who
,
advancing
from
the
wings
,
whithershe
had
retired
,
disclosed
the
figure
and
features
of
Kitty
Conway
.
<EOS>
Sherepeated
the
song
with
infinite
archness
and
spirit
;
and
Randulph
,
likethe
rest
of
the
house
,
was
in
raptures
with
her
.
<EOS>
He
applaudedvehemently
;
and
,
as
Kitty
gracefully
curtseyed
in
return
for
theplaudits
,
she
recognised
him
,
and
during
the
rest
of
the
performancescarcely
ever
removed
her
eye
from
him
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
his
efforts
to
avoidit
,
Randulph
could
not
be
insensible
to
the
witchery
of
her
glance
,
neither
was
he
blind
to
the
perfect
symmetry
of
her
exquisite
littlefigure
,
displayed
to
the
greatest
advantage
in
a
pretty
peasant
dress
,
or
her
airy
movements
,
nor
deaf
to
her
joyous
laugh
that
rung
likesilver
upon
his
ears
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
therefore
,
almost
glad
when
the
curtainfell
,
and
hid
her
from
his
view
.
<EOS>
Trussell
,
who
had
noted
with
secret
satisfaction
the
effect
produced
bythe
pretty
actress
upon
his
nephew
,
and
who
had
,
perhaps
notundesignedly
,
placed
him
so
near
her
,
now
launched
into
a
rapturouspanegyric
of
her
charms
and
talent
,
declaring
both
to
be
unapproachable;and
while
Randulph
was
assenting
to
all
he
heard
,
an
orange
-
womanentered
the
box
,
as
was
then
the
custom
,
and
while
affecting
to
offerher
basket
of
fruit
to
the
elder
gentleman
,
slipped
a
note
into
thehands
of
the
younger
.
<EOS>
She
then
withdrew
,
and
Randulph
,
opening
thebillet
,
found
,
as
he
anticipated
,
that
it
came
from
Kitty
Conway
,
andcontained
an
invitation
to
him
to
sup
with
her
after
the
play
.
<EOS>
"You
will
go
,
of
course
,
"
said
Trussell
,
as
his
nephew
showed
him
thenote
.
<EOS>
Randulph
looked
perplexed
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
afraid
of
a
pretty
woman
?
<EOS>
"
laughed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
I
had
a
betteropinion
of
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
of
you
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
where
she
lives
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
close
by
--
at
the
corner
of
the
Haymarket
,
next
door
to
Cockspur
-
street
.
<EOS>
By
-
the
-
bye
,
the
note
is
not
directed
.
<EOS>
She
does
n't
know
your
name
.
<EOS>
Ha!ha!""Well
,
I
suppose
I
must
go
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
be
sure
you
must
,
"
laughed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
forfeit
all
claim
to
beconsidered
a
youth
of
spirit
if
you
don't
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
entertainments
of
the
evening
were
concluded
by
another
light
operacalled
,
'
Trapolin
's
Vagaries
,
'
in
which
Kitty
Conway
did
not
appear
;
andthis
over
,
they
quitted
the
house
,
and
repaired
to
the
abode
of
thepretty
actress
.
<EOS>
A
footman
in
a
rich
livery
admitted
them
,
and
usheredthem
into
a
small
but
exquisitely
furnished
apartment
,
blazing
with
waxlights
and
mirrors
,
where
they
found
Kitty
seated
on
a
couch
,
conversingwith
an
old
gentleman
,
who
,
as
he
looked
up
at
their
entrance
,
proved
tobe
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
.
<EOS>
An
elderly
female
,
probably
the
fair
actress'smother
,
was
likewise
present
.
<EOS>
The
old
beau
seemed
a
little
disconcertedon
their
appearance
,
but
he
instantly
recovered
himself
.
<EOS>
As
to
KittyConway
,
she
sprang
from
the
couch
,
and
running
towards
Randulph
,
stretched
out
both
hands
to
him
with
unfeigned
joy
,
crying--"Oh
!
<EOS>
howvery
glad
I
am
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
How
kind
in
you
to
come
!
<EOS>
I
had
almost
givenyou
up
.
<EOS>
And
now
you
must
introduce
yourself
to
me
in
due
form
;
forthough
I
wrote
to
you
,
you
may
have
perceived
I
did
n't
know
how
toaddress
my
billet
.
<EOS>
""Permit
me
to
have
that
honor
,
sweet
Kitty
,
"
said
Sir
Singleton
,
stepping
forward
;
"
for
both
gentlemen
are
particular
friends
of
mine
.
<EOS>
Iwas
not
aware
they
were
coming
,
or
I
would
have
taken
care
to
appriseyou
of
their
names
.
<EOS>
This
is
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
newly
arrived
fromCheshire
,
and
with
all
the
freshness
--
in
every
sense
--
of
the
countryabout
him
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
his
uncle
,
Mr.
Trussell
Beechcroft
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
his
guardian
also
,
I
presume
,
"
laughed
Kitty
;
"
for
it
appears
hewon't
<EOS>
let
him
stir
without
him
.
<EOS>
""I
ought
to
apologise
for
this
intrusion
,
Mistress
Conway

saidTrussell
,
"
and
I
can
only
excuse
myself

<EOS>
""You
are
Mr.
Crew

that

replied
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"I
am
delighted
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
""Trussell
<EOS>
bowed
,
and
placed
his
hand
upon
his
heart
--
a
gesture
peculiarto
people
who
have
very
little
heart
to
be
so
indicated
.
<EOS>
"You
have
got
the
start
of
us
,
Sir
Singleton
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
When
we
had
thepleasure
of
seeing
Mistress
Conway
at
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
,
the
otherday
,
I
fancied
you
were
unknown
to
her
.
<EOS>
""Our
<EOS>
acquaintance
is
only
of
two
days

date
,
"
said
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"
Sir
Singletonwas
good
enough
to
send
me--""Hush
!
<EOS>
hush
!
<EOS>
sweet
Kitty
,
I
implore
you
,
"
interrupted
the
old
beau
.
<EOS>
"Nay
<EOS>
,
I
have
n't
been
enjoined
to
secrecy
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
He
sent
me
asuit
of
diamonds
worth
five
hundred
pounds
,
entreating
a
moment'sinterview
in
return
,
which
of
course
I
could
not
refuse
.
<EOS>
""Of
course
not
,
"
laughed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
Do
you
hear
that
,
Randulph
?
"
hewhispered
to
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
you
're
a
lucky
dog!"At
this
moment
the
servant
entered
the
room
,
and
announced
supper
.
<EOS>
Kittygave
her
arm
to
Randulph
,
and
the
old
beau
and
Trussell
contended
forthe
elderly
lady
,
who
at
length
fell
to
the
charge
of
the
former
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
pretty
actress
led
her
guest
to
the
adjoining
chamber
,
the
walls
of
which
were
adorned
with
several
choice
paintings
,
most
ofthem
relating
to
theatrical
subjects
.
<EOS>
Over
the
fire
-
place
hung
aportrait
of
Kitty
herself
in
one
of
her
favourite
characters
,
andRandulph
commented
upon
its
resemblance
to
her
with
a
warmth
thatbrought
the
colour
to
her
cheek
,
and
caused
her
heart
to
palpitateagainst
his
arm
.
<EOS>
A
round
table
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
loadedwith
cold
chickens
,
cold
ham
,
cold
tongue
,
lobsters
,
pates
,
jellies
,
andsalads
.
<EOS>
There
were
several
sorts
of
wine
on
the
table
;
ratafia
,
rosasolis
,
and
usquebaugh
on
the
side

board
;
and
champagne
in

<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
others
made
their
appearance
,
Kitty
dismissedthe
attendant
.
<EOS>
"We
can
wait
upon
ourselves
just
as
well
,
"
she
said
;
"
and
the
presenceof
a
servant
is
always
a
restraint
.
<EOS>
""I
am
quite
of
your
opinion
,
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Allow
me
to
offer
you
awing

replied
Randulph

"I

the

""I

""Singularly

<EOS>
rejoined
Randulph
,
gallantly
.
<EOS>
And
Trussell
,
who
sat
next
him

nudged
him
in
token
of
his
approbation

<EOS>
"By

prefer
a
supper
with
Kitty
Conway
to
all
theparties
in
the
universe
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
flatter
me
,
"
rejoined
the
fair
object
of
the
compliment
;
"
such
apretty
speech
deserves
a
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
Will
you
join
me
and
Mr
.
<EOS>
Crew
in
one?""With
the
greatest
pleasure
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
And
springing
up
with
an
agility
perfectly
youthful
,
he
took
a
bottlefrom
the
ice
-
pail
,
and
poured
its
foaming
contents
into
Kitty
's
glass
.
<EOS>
"A
thousand
thanks
,
Sir
Singleton
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
concerned
to
give
youso
much
trouble
.
<EOS>
""Don't
say
a
word
,
"
replied
the
old
beau
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
enchanted
to
beyour
slave

<EOS>
""I
see
no
reason
why
we
should
n't
follow
their
example

saidTrussell
,
taking
the
bottle
from
Randulph
,
and
assisting
the
elderlylady
.
<EOS>
"Nor
<EOS>
I
,
"
she
replied
,
returning
his
bow
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
-
the
-
bye
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
said
Sir
Singleton
,
"
old
Scarve
<EOS>
the
miser
,
andhis
daughter
Hilda
,
were
at
Lady
Brab
's
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
""I
understood
they
were
expected
,
"
said
the
young
man
,
setting
down
hisglass
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
the
wine
,
is
not
too
much
iced
for
you
?
"
remarked
Kitty
,
anxiously
.
"Not
<EOS>
in
the
least
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
"She
<EOS>
seemed
to
be
greatly
admired
,
"
resumed
Sir
Singleton
;
"
but
for
mypart
,
I
agree
with
Clementina
Brabazon
in
thinking
her
beautyover
-
rated
.
<EOS>
One
thing
,
perhaps
,
might
be
against
her
--
she
was
decidedlyout
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
finished
his
glass
.
<EOS>
"Who
<EOS>
are
you
speaking
of
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Kitty
,
who
,
in
her
anxiety
aboutRandulph
,
had
not
caught
the
previous
remark
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
Scarve
,
"
replied
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
considered
verybeautiful
.
<EOS>
But
she
wo
nt
bear
a
comparison
with
some
one
I
could
pointout
.
<EOS>
""I
accept
the
compliment
,
Sir
Singleton
,
"
rejoined
Kitty
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ihave
heard
of
this
fair
creature
before

<EOS>
Give
me
some
ratafia

Mr.

pledge
me
.
<EOS>
I
can
play
the
hostess

you
perceive

<EOS>
""To
perfection
--
as
you
play
everything
else
,
"
returned
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
you
have
only
seen
me
in
one
part
,
and
ca
n't
therefore
judge
,
"
shereplied
.
"
<EOS>
However
,
I
accept
the
compliment
,
as
I
have
just
done
SirSingleton's
.
<EOS>
"Trussell
<EOS>
had
felt
some
uneasiness
about
his
nephew
during
the
latterpart
of
the
conversation
,
but
he
now
hoped
the
danger
was
past
.
<EOS>
He
wasmistaken
.
<EOS>
"I
forgot
to
say
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
remarked
Sir
Singleton
,
with
a
littlecovert
malice
,
"
that
Villiers
paid
the
miser
's
daughter
very
markedattention
,
and
devoted
himself
to
her
almost
exclusively
during
thewhole
time
I
remained
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Randulph
,
turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
how
did
she
receive
his
attentions
?
"
<EOS>
interposed
Trussell
,
adroitly
.
"Why
,
coldly
enough
<EOS>
,
I
must
say
,
"
replied
Sir
Singleton
.
"Was
<EOS>
her
father
with
her?--did
<EOS>
he
sit
near
her
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Randulph
,
breathlessly
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
;
he
was
at
cards
,
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
,
which
I
will
tell
youanon
.
<EOS>
She
was
attended
by
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
who
I
believe
,
is
arelation
of
her's
.
<EOS>
""Sir
<EOS>
Norfolk
is
her
cousin
on
the
mother
's
side
,
"
remarked
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
is
a
stiff
,
punctilious
old
fellow
,
"
laughed
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"
Hedidn't
seem
in
the
least
to
approve
of
Villiers
'
attentions
to
Hilda
,
and
I
should
n't
wonder
if
they
fight
about
her
tomorrow
.
<EOS>
But
now
for
thestory
I
promised
you
.
<EOS>
Old
Scarve
,
who
,
it
seems
,
is
a
capital
whistplayer--""He
was
always
so
reputed
,
"
observed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
reason
,
as
you
will
find
,
"
rejoined
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
hesat
down
to
cards
,
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
,
with
Sir
BulkeleyPrice
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
won
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
him
.
<EOS>
""Twelve
<EOS>
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
Sir
Singleton
,
"
exclaimed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
amazeme
.
<EOS>
""It
<EOS>
amazed
everybody
else
,
too
,
I
assure
you
,
"
replied
Sir
Singleton
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Bulkeley
had
had
too
much
wine
;
and
he
went
on
losing
and
doublinghis
bets
until
his
losses
amounted
to
the
sum
I
've
mentioned
.
<EOS>
I
tried
tostop
him
;
but
it
was
of
no
avail
.
<EOS>
You
should
have
seen
the
old
miserrise
from
the
table
after
his
success
.
<EOS>
I
never
beheld
such
fearfulexultation
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
literally
blazed
,
and
he
walked
like
a
young
man
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Bulkeley
got
up
at
the
same
time
with
a
very
flushed
face
,
and
said,"You
<EOS>
shall
have
your
winnings
to
-
morrow
,
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
which
the
miserreplied
,
with
a
bitter
sneer
,
"
The
mortgage
will
do
as
well
,
SirBulkeley
.
<EOS>
""A
home
thrust
!
<EOS>
and
just
like
him

"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
've
lost
somemoney
in
my
time
,
but
never
anything
like
this
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
I
could
have
such
luck
as
the
miser
,
"
said
Kitty
,
"
I
'd
leave
offacting
,
and
take
to
gaming
.
<EOS>
But
you
've
been
talking
so
hard
,
that
you'veforgotten
to
eat
,
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
should
be
glad
of
somechampagne
.
<EOS>
"Her
<EOS>
glass
was
instantly
filled
by
Randulph
,
and
Sir
Singleton
challengedthe
elderly
lady
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
then
became
very
lively
;
Kittypresently
volunteered
a
song
,
which
she
executed
so
charmingly
,
that
itquite
ravished
her
auditors
.
<EOS>
In
fact
,
her
sprightliness
,
beauty
,
andaccomplishments
,
coupled
with
her
winning
manners
and
good
-
nature
,
madeher
almost
irresistible
--
and
so
Randulph
found
.
<EOS>
The
champagne
circulatedfreely
,
and
its
effects
began
to
be
slightly
manifested
on
the
twoelderly
gentlemen
.
<EOS>
Again
Kitty
poured
forth
her
clear
and
melodiousvoice
in
song
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
a
young
man
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
It
was
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
He
looked
surprised
and
annoyed
at
seeing
theparty
,
and
a
flush
of
anger
rose
to
his
cheek
as
he
recognised
Randulph
.
<EOS>
Kitty
Conway
carelessly
motioned
him
to
a
chair
,
which
he
took
almostmechanically
.
<EOS>
Sir
Singleton
and
Trussell
slightly
acknowledged
hispresence
,
but
Randulph
sternly
regarded
him
.
<EOS>
"I
believe
,
sir
,
"
he
said
,
"
you
are
the
person
I
saw
at
Mr.
Scarve's
,
and
whom
I
previously
met
at
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
May
I
ask
themeaning
of
the
masquerade
attire
you
assumed
yesterday?""You
were
under
some
mistake
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Philip
,
with
greateffrontery
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
nothing
of
Mr.
Scarve
.
""Not
know
him
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Randulph
,
in
amazement
,
"
<EOS>
I
understood
you
were
hisnephew
,
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
""I
am
no
relation
to
Mr.
Scarve
,
and
my
name
is
not
Philip
Frewin,"replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
Kitty
Conway
here
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
,
which
she
continued
in
spiteof
Philip
's
angry
looks
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
oblige
me
with
your
real
name
,
then
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Randulph
,
aftera
pause
.
<EOS>
"No
,
sir
,
I
will
not
,
"
replied
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
What
the
devil
is
it
to
you
whatI
am
called
?
<EOS>
I
am
not
accountable
to
you
for
my
actions
.
<EOS>
How
comes
thisimpertinent
fellow
here
,
Kitty
?
"
he
added
,
turning
to
her
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
comes
by
my
invitation
,
"
she
rejoined
.
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
do
not
like
hiscompany
,
you
can
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
""It
is
for
him
to
leave
the
house
,
not
me
,
"
replied
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
If
he
won'tgo
out
quietly
,
I
shall
be
under
the
necessity
of
turning
him
out
.
<EOS>
"Kitty
uttered
a
faint
scream
,
and
Randulph
sprang
to
his
feet
,
while
therest
of
the
party
regarded
each
other
in
dismay
,
as
if
in
expectation
ofa
scene
.
<EOS>
Under
the
influence
of
excessive
passion
,
which
supplied
him
with
acourage
foreign
to
his
craven
nature
,
Philip
strode
towards
Randulph
,
apparently
with
the
intention
of
carrying
his
threat
into
execution
;
butbefore
he
could
reach
him
,
Kitty
threw
herself
between
them
.
<EOS>
Under
hershelter
,
Philip
became
so
violent
in
his
manner
,
and
offensive
in
hislanguage
,
that
at
last
Randulph
lost
his
patience
,
and
snatching
SirSingleton
's
clouded
cane
from
him
,
he
pushed
Kitty
aside
,
and
began
tolay
it
with
considerable
energy
upon
Philip
's
shoulders
.
<EOS>
Roaringlustily
,
the
latter
made
for
the
door
,
and
Randulph
pursued
him
,
Kittyfollowing
closely
after
them
,
to
see
that
no
mischief
ensued
.
<EOS>
In
thisway
,
they
hurried
along
the
lobby
,
where
Philip
got
open
the
streetdoor
,
and
darted
out
with
such
rapidity
that
he
ran
against
a
tall
manwho
chanced
to
be
passing
at
the
time
,
and
who
instantly
caught
hold
ofhim
.
<EOS>
Before
his
captor
walked
two
other
persons
,
preceded
by
a
link
-
boy
,
and
the
latter
hearing
the
noise
,
turned
round
,
and
threw
his
light
fullupon
the
party
.
<EOS>
The
persons
in
advance
were
the
miser
and
his
daughter
,
who
were
returning
from
Lady
Brabason
's
,
and
the
tall
man
was
no
otherthan
Jacob
Post
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Randulph
rushed
forth
;
but
on
seeingthe
miser
and
his
daughter
,
he
halted
in
dismay
,
which
was
notdiminished
as
Kitty
Conway
came
up
and
caught
hold
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
It
was
anembarrassing
situation
certainly
,
and
Randulph
was
so
confounded
that
hecould
not
utter
a
word
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
meanwhile
,
had
discovered
the
prize
he
had
caught
,
and
he
lost
notime
in
announcing
his
good
luck
.
<EOS>
"Look
<EOS>
here
,
sir
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
triumphantly
;
"
look
at
your
miserly
nephew!I
<EOS>
have
him
fast
enough
.
<EOS>
Look
at
the
clothes
he
has
on
.
<EOS>
Mayhap
,
he'lldeny
himself
now
.
<EOS>
Look
at
him
,
I
say
,
sir
!
<EOS>
and
satisfy
yourself
thatit
's
him
,
for
he
'll
outswear
afterwards
if
you
don't
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
Philip
!
"
cried
the
miser
,
"
is
it
really
<EOS>
you?""It
is
,
sir
,
"
replied
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
if
you
will
order
your
servant
torelease
me
,
I
will
explain
how
I
came
to
be
here
,
and
in
this
dress
.
<EOS>
Ihave
been
put
in
peril
of
my
life
by
Randulph
Crew
,
who
stands
therewith
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
""Release
<EOS>
him
,
Jacob
,
"
said
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"I'd
<EOS>
rather
you
'd
let
me
take
him
to
Saint
James
's
Round
-
house
,
"
repliedJacob
;
"
I
'm
sure
it
's
the
fittest
place
for
him
.
<EOS>
""Do
as
I
bid
you
,
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Scarve
,
authoritatively
.
<EOS>
"
Now
then
,
what
is
the
meaning
of
all
this
,
Philip?""Do
not
inquire
further
,
father
,
"
cried
Hilda
,
trembling
violently
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
away
,
I
beseech
you
.
<EOS>
"Seeing
<EOS>
that
Randulph
was
unable
to
speak
,
Kitty
Conway
advanced
towardsthe
miser
.
<EOS>
"I
can
explain
what
has
happened
in
a
moment
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"Father
!
"
said
Hilda
,
in
a
determined
tone
,
"
If
you
will
not
accompanyme
,
I
will
walk
forward
by
myself
.
<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
ready
to
go
with
you
,
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
well
,
I
'm
coming
,
"
replied
the
miser--"some
other
time
,
nephew
--
some
other
time
.
"
<EOS>
As
the
miser
and
his
daughter
moved
off
in
onedirection
,
Philip
,
fearful
of
the
consequences
of
remaining
,
ran
off
inthe
other
.
<EOS>
At
this
moment
,
Trussell
and
Sir
Singleton
appeared
at
thedoor
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
have
you
got
rid
of
him
?
"
cried
the
former
.
<EOS>
"Look
<EOS>
where
he
runs
,
"
laughed
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"
Who
,
think
you
,
chanced
to
bepassing
at
the
very
time
we
came
forth?""Perhaps
<EOS>
the
miser
and
his
daughter
,
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
good
guess
,
"
replied
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"The
devil
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trussell--"and
they
saw
you
with
my
nephew
?
<EOS>
Why
,
this
is
worse
than
the
Folly
on
the
Thames!""Far
worse
!
"
<EOS>
groaned
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
My
hopes
are
now
utterly
destroyed!""I
do
n't
understand
you
,
"
said
Kitty
;
"
but
come
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
bitterly
;
"
and
I
would
I
had
never
entered
it!""For
<EOS>
Heaven
's
sake
,
Randulph
,
consider
what
you
are
about

criedTrussell--"this
rudeness
to
a
pretty
woman

who
has
shewn
you
so
muchkindness

<EOS>
I
blush
for
you

<EOS>
""I
am
no
longer
master
of
myself
,
"
cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
And
murmuring
some
apology
to
Kitty
,
he
bade
her
good
night
,
and
walkedoff
with
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
here
's
a
pretty
conclusion
to
the
supper

"
said
Kitty
to
the
oldbeau

<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
know
whether
to
laugh

perhaps
I

CHAPTER
IV.--RANDULPH
'S
CAREER
OF
GAIETY
--
ABEL
'S
<EOS>
REMARKS
UPON
IT
TO
MR
.
<EOS>
JUKES.Randulph
's
reflections
on
awaking
the
next
morning
were
not
of
the
mostenviable
kind
;
and
bitterly
did
he
reproach
himself
for
his
imprudence
.
<EOS>
Fate
seemed
determined
to
place
an
insurmountable
bar
between
him
andthe
object
of
his
hopes
,
and
he
,
at
last
,
in
some
degree
,
consoledhimself
,
as
many
others
have
done
before
him
,
by
thinking
that
he
wasrather
the
victim
of
necessity
than
of
his
own
misconduct
.
<EOS>
Throughoutthe
early
part
of
the
day
,
he
continued
in
a
state
of
deep
depression
,
from
which
Trussell
in
vain
tried
to
rouse
him
.
<EOS>
As
to
Abel
,
havingascertained
from
Mr.
Jukes
the
cause
of
his
despondency
,
he
forbore
toquestion
him
about
it
,
and
even
feigned
not
to
notice
it
.
<EOS>
It
requiredsome
little
persuasion
to
induce
him
to
dine
with
Lady
Brabazon
thatday
;
but
once
in
the
atmosphere
of
her
ladyship
's
wit
and
pleasantry
,
hesoon
revived
.
<EOS>
Divining
,
with
true
feminine
tact
,
the
cause
of
hisdejection
,
she
speedily
dissipated
it
by
her
fine
powers
of
raillery;and
,
to
his
own
surprise
,
he
passed
a
very
agreeable
evening
,
andquitted
the
house
more
than
half
in
love
with
its
fair
mistress
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
of
the
impression
,
she
had
produced
,
Lady
Brabazon
did
notfail
to
improve
it
.
<EOS>
She
included
him
in
all
her
parties
for
a
month
tocome
,
and
took
care
to
involve
him
in
such
a
round
of
gaiety
andfashionable
dissipation
,
that
he
could
not
by
any
means
extricatehimself
from
it
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
this
was
soon
manifest
in
his
habits
,
inhis
attire
,
and
in
his
manners
;
and
though
the
change
was
mightilyapproved
of
by
Trussell
,
it
was
viewed
in
a
very
different
light
by
hismore
sagacious
and
far
sighted
uncle
.
<EOS>
"Well
<EOS>
,
Jukes
,
"
said
the
latter
,
one
day
to
his
butler
,
"
my
first
opinionof
Randulph
is
fully
borne
out
by
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
he
is
rather
gay
,
to
be
sure
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
do
n't
givehim
up
yet
.
<EOS>
Young
men
,
as
Mr.
Trussell
says
,
will
be
young
men
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
there
's
no
occasion
for
them
to
be
young
rakes
,
"
cried
Abel
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
My
nephew
is
a
sad
dissipated
dog
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
seems
to
havegot
him
completely
into
her
toils
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
she
's
a
dangerous
woman
!
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
,
lifting
up
his
hand--"adangerous
woman!""And
<EOS>
the
pretty
actress
,
Kitty
Conway
?
"
pursued
Abel
.
"
<EOS>
He
sups
with
heroccasionally
,
eh?""I
fear
he
does
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"Fear
--
you
know
he
does
,
sirrah
,
"
cried
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Why
attempt
toequivocate
?
<EOS>
What
masquerade
were
they
talking
of
at
breakfast
thismorning?""What
have
n't
you
heard
of
it
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
a
grandmasquerade
to
be
held
at
Ranelagh
on
Thursday
.
<EOS>
All
the
world
is
goingthere
;
and
,
amongst
others
,
my
graceless
nephew
,
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
.
<EOS>
""What
!
<EOS>
in
his
master
's
clothes
,
as
before
?
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"No
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
as
harlequin
.
<EOS>
""Harlequin
!
"
echoed
Abel
;
"
that
will
suit
him
exactly
.
<EOS>
And
I
hope
thesilly
widow
he
is
paying
his
addresses
to
will
go
as
Columbine
.
<EOS>
""Precisely
<EOS>
what
she
means
to
do
,
sir
,
"
laughed
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"Get
<EOS>
me
a
domino
before
Thursday
,
Jukes
<EOS>
;
I
'll
go
to
this
masquerademyself
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
sir
,
you
're
becoming
as
great
a
rake
as
your
nephew
,
"
returned
Mr
.
Jukes
,
laughingly
.
<EOS>
"
If
I
might
be
permitted
,
I
should
like
to
go
withyou
to
Ranelagh

<EOS>
I
wish
to
have
an
eye

sad
plagues

sad

not

replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
givehim
another
month
,
and
then--""You'll
give
him
another
after
that
,
"
interrupted
the
butler,"No
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
,
"
rejoined
Abel
;
"
I
wo
n't
give
him
a
day

nor
an

<EOS>
I
've
spent
nearly
a
hundred
pounds
upon
him
already
--
upon

--
his
amusements

his
profligacies

<EOS>
No
,
I
'll
pack
him
off

<EOS>
By

the

his

has
written
to

<EOS>
I
've
endeavoured
to
dissuade
her
from
the
step
,
but
she
says
sheis
uneasy
about
Randulph

<EOS>
""Well

I

'll
come

"
returned
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
I
'm
sure

<EOS>
""I've
<EOS>
no

"
said
Abel
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
There
has
been
acoolness
between

<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
the

the

<EOS>
"Don't

""Don't

V.--RANDULPH
RECEIVES
A
LETTER
FROM
HIS
MOTHER
--
<EOS>
ITS
EFFECT
UPON
HIM
--
<EOS>
HISGOOD
RESOLUTIONS
DEFEATED
BY
TRUSSELL.Randulph
's
mother
had
only
written
to
him
twice
since
his
arrival
intown,--for
in
those
days
ladies
,
especially
country
ladies
,
were
neitherso
active
nor
so
exacting
in
their
correspondence
,
as
at
present,--whenone
day
,
just
as
he
was
sallying
forth
on
a
pleasurable
expedition
withTrussell
<EOS>
,
a
letter
was
delivered
to
him
by
Mr.
Jukes
,
bearing
hersuperscription
.
<EOS>
Glancing
at
it
with
some
misgiving
,
he
would
have
brokenthe
seal
,
but
Trussell
,
noticing
his
reluctance
,
and
guessing
the
cause
,
advised
him
to
put
it
in
his
pocket
,
and
read
it
on
his
return
at
night
.
<EOS>
"Good
advice
,
"
he
said
,
laughingly
,
"
is
all
the
better
for
keeping,--itschief
recommendation
being
that
it
is
just
as
effectual
a
monthafterwards
as
at
the
moment
given
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
it
had
been
a
billet
from
Lady
Brabazon
or
Kitty
Conway
<EOS>
he
wouldhave
opened
it
without
hesitation
,
"
remarked
Abel
,
who
stood
by
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
be
sure
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
"
and
he
would
have
done
quite
right
,
because
such
a
note
would
require
immediate
attention
,
and
as
a
man
ofbreeding
he
could
not
leave
it
a
moment
unanswered
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
am
I
to
infer
,
therefore
,
that
a
mother
's
letter
is
to
be
putaside
?
<EOS>
"
rejoined
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
exactly
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Trussell
;
"
but
when
one
knows
that
itcontains
a
lecture
,
one
naturally
feels
indisposed
to
read
it
.
<EOS>
That
Isuppose
you
can
understand
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
no
such
thing
,
"
replied
Abel
,
tartly
,
"
but
I
perfectlyunderstand
how
excessive
addiction
to
pleasure
injures
the
bestprinciples
,
and
chills
the
warmest
affections
.
<EOS>
Filial
love
and
duty
havelittle
influence
when
dissipation
has
obtained
the
sway
.
<EOS>
""I
acknowledge
the
justness
of
your
rebuke
,
uncle
,
"
said
Randulph
,
"
andwill
read
the
letter
instantly
.
<EOS>
""On
no
account
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Abel
;
"
pursue
your
first
impulse
.
<EOS>
It
willkeep
,
as
my
brother
says
,
till
to
-
night
,
and
you
may
possibly
be
then
ina
better
frame
of
mind
for
its
perusal
.
<EOS>
When
you
have
possessed
yourselfof
its
contents
,
I
shall
be
glad
to
be
made
acquainted
with
them
.
"
<EOS>
Andturning
away
,
he
retreated
to
the
library
.
<EOS>
It
was
late
when
Randulph
returned
,
after
a
day
spent
in
gaiety
,
asusual
,
and
on
retiring
to
his
own
room
,
his
first
business
was
to
takeout
his
mother
's
letter
.
<EOS>
Opening
it
,
he
eagerly
scanned
its
contents
,
which
ran
thus:--"MY
DEAR
SON,--The
accounts
I
have
received
of
your
mode
of
life
havegiven
me
inexpressible
uneasiness
.
<EOS>
A
mother
's
hopes
are
perhaps
seldomfulfilled
,
and
my
expectations
,
I
now
feel
,
were
too
sanguine
ever
to
berealized
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
did
not
anticipate
such
complete
disappointment
as
Ihave
experienced
.
<EOS>
With
your
generous
nature
and
quick
impulses
,
I
shouldnot
have
been
surprised
at
your
being
led
into
slight
indiscretions
;
butthat
you
should
have
plunged
so
deeply
into
dissipation
,
and
connectedyourself
with
persons
<EOS>
so
very
profligate
,
grieves
me
to
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Yourconduct
,
I
believe
is
mainly
attributable
to
bad
advice
,
and
therefore
,
in
some
degree
,
to
be
excused
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle
Trussell
is
not
withoutprinciple
,
and
has
a
kindly
disposition
,
but
the
enjoyment
of
the
momentis
all
he
cares
for
,
and
he
is
utterly
reckless
of
consequences
.
<EOS>
Ithought
I
had
sufficiently
guarded
you
against
him
,
but
I
now
see
myerror
,
and
feel
that
I
ought
never
to
have
introduced
you
to
society
sodangerously
.
<EOS>
My
reliance
was
in
your
uncle
Abel
.
<EOS>
I
persuaded
myself
youwould
discern
the
good
that
lies
beneath
the
surface
of
that
excellentman
,
and
anticipated
much
from
your
introduction
to
him
.
<EOS>
Not
the
least
,
therefore
,
of
my
affliction
is
the
knowledge
that
you
have
forfeited
hisgood
opinion
.
<EOS>
Let
me
hope
it
is
not
too
late
to
regain
it
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
your
first
letter
you
spoke
of
Hilda
Scarve
in
terms
of
the
highestadmiration
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
informed
from
another
source
that
she
is
ashighly
gifted
as
beautiful
,
and
I
confess
it
would
have
delighted
me
tosee
you
united
to
her
.
<EOS>
I
am
aware
there
are
obstacles
in
the
way
;
butthey
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
removed
.
<EOS>
Here
again
,
your
misconduct
,
or
,
to
give
it
its
mildest
term
,
your
imprudence
,
has
been
prejudicial
toyou
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
another
point
--
<EOS>
namely
,
your
interview
with
the
mysterious
individualbeneath
the
cloisters
of
Westminster
Abbey
,
I
do
not
deem
it
prudent
towrite
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
conclusion
,
my
dear
son
,
I
beseech
you
to
pause
in
your
headlongcareer
,
to
abandon
the
worthless
society
you
have
formed
,
and
to
placeyourself
under
the
guidance
of
your
uncle
Abel
.
<EOS>
He
can
save
you
.
<EOS>
Andthat
he
may
do
so
<EOS>
is
the
fervent
prayer
of
your
most
affectionatemother,"SOPHIA
CREW."Randulph
<EOS>
read
this
letter
over
and
over
again
,
and
each
time
with
freshself
reproaches
.
<EOS>
He
thought
his
mother
viewed
his
indiscretions
in
tooserious
a
light
,
but
he
could
not
disguise
from
himself
that
her
fearswere
well
grounded
.
<EOS>
What
chiefly
affected
him
,
however
,
was
the
passagereferring
to
Hilda
,
and
its
re
-
perusal
caused
him
to
pace
his
chamberwith
agitated
steps
.
<EOS>
At
last
he
became
calmer
,
and
sought
his
couch
;
but
he
could
not
sleep
,
and
in
the
morning
arose
feverish
and
unrefreshed
.
<EOS>
His
uncles
were
atthe
breakfast
-
table
before
him
;
but
though
both
noticed
his
dejected
andhaggard
appearance
,
neither
commented
upon
it
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
Trussellwas
livelier
than
usual
,
and
rattled
away
about
the
masquerade
to
begiven
at
Ranelagh
on
the
following
day
,
dilating
upon
the
amusement
tobe
expected
at
it
.
<EOS>
All
at
once
Randulph
broke
silence
.
<EOS>
"I
do
not
intend
to
go
to
the
masquerade
,
uncle
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"Not
go
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trussell
,
laying
down
a
piece
of
broiled
ham
whichhe
<EOS>
was
conveying
to
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Not
go!--why
not
,
in
the
name
ofwonder?"Abel
eyed
his
nephew
narrowly
.
<EOS>
"I
have
been
too
much
at
such
places
of
late
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
Trussell
burst
into
a
derisive
laugh
.
<EOS>
"I
see
how
it
is
,
"
he
said
;
"
you
have
received
a
dose
of
good
counselfrom
your
mother
,
and
are
labouring
under
its
effects
.
<EOS>
""I
trust
<EOS>
I
shall
profit
by
the
advice
I
have
received
,
"
repliedRandulph
;
"
<EOS>
and
as
the
first
step
towards
it
,
I
mean
to
abstain
from
themasquerade
at
Ranelagh

<EOS>
"Abel
fastened
his
grey
eyes
upon
him
,
as
if
he
would
read
his
soul
,
buthe
made
no
remark
.
<EOS>
"Well

well
,
do
as
you
please
,
my
dear
boy

"
said
Trussell,--"do

<EOS>
I

you
.
<EOS>
But
a
moment
's
reflectionwill
convince
you
that
your
mother
is
not
in
a
condition
to
judge
ofyour
conduct
.
<EOS>
She
can
only
learn
what
you
are
doing
by
report
;
andreport
always
exaggerates
.
<EOS>
Her
alarm
is
quite
natural
.
<EOS>
You
are
adevilish
handsome
fellow
--
very
much
liked
by
the
women,--very
muchcourted
by
persons
of
quality
.
<EOS>
People
in
the
country
are
terribly
afraidof
pretty
women
and
great
folks
;
but
you
know
that
both
are
perfectlyharmless
.
<EOS>
My
only
uneasiness
about
you
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
dry
cough
,
anda
side
glance
at
his
brother
,
"
is
,
that
your
means
are
rather
inadequateto
your
expenses
.
<EOS>
But
you
may
be
richer
one
of
these
days
.
<EOS>
""I
see
little
prospect
of
it
,
"
muttered
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
think
there
is
every
prospect
of
his
making
a
good
match
<EOS>
,
sir,--butthat
is
neither
here
nor
there
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
you
do
n't
allude
to
Beau
Villiers
's
cast
-
off
mistress
,
LadyBrabazon
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
rather
he
married
Kitty
Conway
than
thatworthless
woman
.
<EOS>
There
is
at
least
some
honesty
about
the
actress
.
<EOS>
""Do
not
be
apprehensive
on
that
score
,
uncle
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
;
"
I
amnot
likely
to
be
so
duped
:
my
eyes
are
opened
to
my
folly
.
<EOS>
""How
<EOS>
long
will
they
continue
so
?
"
<EOS>
sneered
Abel
.
"
<EOS>
Satiety
begetsloathing
,
but
with
a
fresh
appetite
you
will
begin
anew
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
he
will
,
"
said
Trussell
;
"
for
I
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
,
discover
the
harm
he
has
committed
.
<EOS>
""It
would
surprise
me
if
you
did
,
"
observed
Abel
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
The
conversation
here
dropped
,
and
the
party
continued
their
breakfastin
silence
.
<EOS>
At
its
close
,
the
older
uncle
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
"You
were
somewhat
rash
in
forming
the
resolution
you
have
justannounced
,
Randulph
,
"
observed
Trussell
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
;
"
Ididn't
like
to
say
so
before
my
brother
,
but
I
felt
quite
sure
of
yourgoing
to
the
masquerade
,
notwithstanding
your
declaration
to
thecontrary
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
,
sir
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
with
the
air
of
a
person
whohas
come
to
an
unalterable
determination
.
<EOS>
"No
,
I
am
not
,
"
rejoined
Trussell
,
smiling
;
"
and
when
I
tell
you
thatHilda
Scarve
will
be
there
,
I
rather
fancy
you
will
acknowledge
thecorrectness
of
my
remark
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
that
alters
the
case
,
indeed
,
"
exclaimed
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
But
are
yousure
of
what
you
tell
me?""As
sure
as
we
are
now
sitting
together
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
She
isgoing
there
under
the
escort
of
her
relation
,
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
of
course
I
must
go
,
"
cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
n't
lose
the
chanceof
meeting
her
for
the
world
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
you
forget
--
<EOS>
you
have
been
too
much
at
such
places
of
late
,
"
jeeredTrussell
.
<EOS>
"One
<EOS>
more
visit
can
make
no
difference
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
there
's
no
knowing
what
it
may
lead
to
,
"
pursued
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Recollect
<EOS>
your
eyes
are
open
to
your
folly
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""Laugh
<EOS>
as
much
as
you

replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
do
not
go
tosee
the
masquerade
,
but
to
meet
Hilda
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
'm
glad
of
your
determination
,
whatever
plea
you
put
it
<EOS>
upon,"rejoined
<EOS>
Trussell
,
seriously
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
Abel
re
-
appeared
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Randulph
,
"
he
said
,
regarding
him--"still
of

eh?""I
fear
you
will
have
little

I

replied
Randulph
,
colouring
with
shame
.
<EOS>
"I
expected
as
much

replied
Abel
,
coldly
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
you

<EOS>
""Indeed

I

not

said
Trussell

<EOS>
"
Have
I

Randulph?""You

was
the
reply

<EOS>
"Then

me
give
you
one
piece
of
advice

Randulph

VI.--THE
FAIR
THOMASINE
'S
<EOS>
VISIT
TO
HILDA
--
<EOS>
HER
MYSTERIOUS
COMMUNICATION
--
INWHAT
WAY
,
<EOS>
AND
BY
WHOM
THE
ATTEMPT
TO
CARRY
OFF
HILDA
WAS
PREVENTED
<EOS>
--
THEMISER
BURIES
<EOS>
HIS
TREASURE
IN
THE
CELLAR.During
all
this
time
,
the
miser
continued
to
lead
precisely
the
samelife
as
before
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
application
to
Abel
Beechcroft
,
Jacob
Post
had
not
quitted
his
master
's
service
;
for
with
all
theirbickerings
and
disagreements
,
the
porter
was
strongly
attached
to
him
.
<EOS>
Aword
,
moreover
,
from
Hilda
had
turned
the
scale
,
and
decided
Jacob
uponstaying
.
<EOS>
Things
,
therefore
,
went
on
in
their
usual
way
.
<EOS>
Diggs
hadcontrived
,
by
producing
deeds
and
other
documents
,
which
appearedregularly
executed
,
to
convince
the
miser
that
his
nephew
's
account
ofhis
circumstances
was
correct
.
<EOS>
But
the
project
of
the
alliance
wasdropped
,
or
suffered
to
remain
in
abeyance
,
and
Hilda
endured
no
furtherannoyance
respecting
it
.
<EOS>
But
it
must
not
be
imagined
she
was
perfectlytranquil
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
she
was
haunted
by
the
recollection
ofRandulph
,
who
had
made
a
much
deeper
impression
on
her
heart
than
shehad
at
first
supposed
;
and
though
she
made
the
strongest
efforts
tobanish
his
image
from
her
thoughts
,
they
were
unsuccessful
.
<EOS>
The
veryjealousy
she
had
experienced
increased
the
flame
;
and
her
casualencounter
with
him
as
she
was
returning
from
Lady
Brabazon
's
,
tended
tokeep
it
alive
.
<EOS>
She
saw
nothing
of
him
,
except
that
her
father
now
andthen
told
her
,
with
a
bitter
sneer
,
that
he
had
become
excessivelydissipated
.
<EOS>
But
she
now
began
to
find
excuses
for
him
,
and
blamedherself
for
having
acted
harshly
towards
him
on
their
last
interview
.
<EOS>
Her
solitary
life
,
too
,
contributed
to
foster
her
passion
.
<EOS>
She
hadlittle
to
dwell
on
besides
him
,
and
his
image
being
most
frequentlypresented
to
her
imagination
,
insensibly
became
linked
with
heraffections
.
<EOS>
One
morning
,
when
her
father
was
from
home
,
and
she
was
sitting
in
herown
room
,
Jacob
tapped
at
the
door
,
and
informed
her
that
the
mercer'sdaughter
from
over
the
way
,
Miss
Thomasine
Deacle
,
was
below
,
and
beggedto
speak
with
her
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
came
down
stairs
,
and
found
the
young
lady
in
questionawaiting
her
,
and
very
finely
dressed
,
being
attired
in
a
red
and
yellowdamask
gown
,
with
a
red
satin
stomacher
,
bands
at
her
ruffles
,
and
apretty
little
fly
-
cap
similarly
bedizened
.
<EOS>
She
was
gazing
round
the
roomwith
the
greatest
curiosity
,
but
on
seeing
Hilda
,
she
rushed
towardsher
,
and
wringing
her
hands
,
exclaimed
,
in
tones
of
the
deepestcommiseration
,
"
And
is
it
in
this
miserable
place
that
loveliness
likeyours
is
immured
!
<EOS>
What
a
marble
-
hearted
tyrant
your
father
must
be!"Hilda
looked
at
a
loss
to
comprehend
the
meaning
of
this
address
.
<EOS>
"I
beg
pardon
,
"
pursued
the
fair
Thomasine
,
"
but
I
am
so
horror
-
strickenby
the
sight
of
these
naked
walls
,
and
this
desolate
apartment
,
that
Imay
,
perchance
,
have
expressed
myself
too
strongly
.
<EOS>
Oh
!
<EOS>
how
can
youexist
here
,
Miss
Scarve?""I
contrive
to
do
so
,
strange
as
it
may
appear
,
"
replied
Hilda
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"This
is
a
moment
I
have
for
months
sighed
for
,
"
cried
the
fairThomasine
,
falling
into
a
theatrical
attitude
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
longed
to
communewith
you
.
<EOS>
You
will
soon
understand
me
,
as
I
understand
you

<EOS>
Yes
,
HildaScarve
and
Thomasine
Deacle
,
however
disproportionate
their
rank
,
willbe
constant
and
attached

<EOS>
From
this
moment
I
devote
myself
toyou
.
<EOS>
We
have
both
many
feelings
in
common
.
<EOS>
We
both
love
--
and
have
bothbeen
disappointed
;
or
rather
,
our
affections
have
been
betrayed
.
<EOS>
""I
must
beg
you
to
cease
this
absurd
strain
,
Miss
Deacle
,
if
theinterview
is
to
be
continued
,
"
replied
Hilda
,
somewhat
haughtily
.
"
<EOS>
Ihave
neither
loved
nor
been
disappointed
.
<EOS>
""Nay
<EOS>
,
fear
me
not
,
"
rejoined
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"
Your
secrets
will
beas
secure
in
my
bosom
as
in
your
own
.
<EOS>
I
am
a
woman
,
and
know
of
what
awoman
's
heart
is
composed

<EOS>
I
deeply
sympathize
with
you
.
<EOS>
I
know
howtenderly
you
love
Randulph
Crew
,
and
how
unworthy
he
has
proved
himselfof
your
regard
.
<EOS>
""Really
,
Miss
Deacle
,
"
cried
Hilda
,
blushing
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
suffer
you
totalk
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
""I
only
do
so
to
shew
you
that
you
may
have
entire
confidence
in
me,"replied
the
fair
Thomasine
.
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr.
Crew
is
very
handsome,--veryhandsome
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
wonder
at
his
inspiring
a
strong
passion
.
<EOS>
""You
are
mistaken
in
supposing
<EOS>
he
has
inspired
me
with
one
,
"
rejoinedHilda
,
somewhat
piqued
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
you
do
not
come
from
him
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
no
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
fair
Thomasine
;
"
but
if
I
can
do
aught
to
forwardthe
affair
--
if
I
can
convey
any
message
to
him
--
command
me
.
<EOS>
""It
is
time
to
put
an
end
to
this
nonsense
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
If
you
havenothing
else
to
speak
to
me
about
,
except
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
I
must
wishyou
a
good
morning

<EOS>
""One
<EOS>
object
in
my
coming
hither
,
Miss
Scarve
<EOS>
,
I
will
frankly
confess
,
was
to
make
your
acquaintance
,
and
,
I
trust
,
form
a
lasting
friendshipwith
you

replied
the
fair
Thomasine
,
somewhat
discomposed
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
mychief
motive
,
"
she
added
,
assuming
a
mysterious
look
,
and
lowering
hervoice
to
those
deep
tones
in
which
fearful
intelligence
is
announced
ina
melo

"
was
to
inform
you
that
an
attempt
will
be
made
to
carryyou
off

night!""Carry
me
off

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Hilda
,
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
carry
you
off
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"
Dreadful
,
is
n't
it?But
<EOS>
it
is
what
all
heroines
,
like
ourselves
,
are
subject
to
.
<EOS>
I
may
nottell
you
who
gave
me
the
intelligence
,
but
you
may
rely
upon
it
.
<EOS>
Mostlikely
,
you
have
some
suspicion
of
the
hateful
contriver
of
the
basedesign
.
<EOS>
Our
sex
are
seldom
deceived
in
such
matters
.
<EOS>
I
was
bound
tosecrecy
,
but
I
could
not
keep
the
matter
from
you
.
<EOS>
Whatever
happens
,
Imust
not

<EOS>
Promise
me
I
shall
not
be
so

""You
<EOS>
shall
not

"
replied
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
oh
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
pursued
the
fair
Thomasine
,
"
to
appreciate
myregard
for
you
--
to
understand
me
thoroughly
--
you
must
know

<EOS>
though
Itremble
to
mention
it
--
that
you
are
my
rival

<EOS>
yes
,
my
rival

<EOS>
Yourmatchless
charms
have
estranged
the
affections
of
my
beloved
and
oncedevoted
Peter
Pokerich
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
feel
no
resentment
against
you
--
but
,
onthe
contrary
,
I
admire
you
beyond
expression
.
<EOS>
A
time
may
come
when
I
maybe
useful
to
you
;
and
then
forget
not
your
humble
,
but
faithful
friend
,
Thomasine
Deacle

<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
will
not
--
I
will
not

"
replied
Hilda
,
who
began
to
entertain
somedoubts
as
to
her
companion
's
sanity
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
greatly
obliged
by
yourinformation

will
not
fail
to
profit

Good
morning

""Farewell
!
"
exclaimed
the
fair
Thomasine
,
pathetically
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
I
amimperfectly
understood
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
assured
her
to
the
contrary
,
and
summoning
Jacob
,
he
ushered
herto
the
door
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
fair
Thomasine
had
departed
,
Hilda
acquainted
her
auntwith
<EOS>
the
intelligence
she
had
received
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Clinton
was
inclined
to
putlittle
faith
in
it
,
but
recommended
that
their
relation
,
Sir
NorfolkSalusbury
,
should
be
consulted
on
the
subject
.
<EOS>
To
this
,
however
,
Hildaobjected
,
and
Jacob
Post
was
summoned
to
the
conference
.
<EOS>
"Don't
say
a
word
about
it
to
any
one
--
not
even
to
master
,
"
said
theporter
,
on
being
appealed
to
;
"
leave
the
affair
to
me
,
and
I
'll
warrantyou

Master
Philip
Frewin,--for
<EOS>
I

no
doubt
it

him,--sha'n't

<EOS>
Go
to
bed
just
as
usual

and
think
no

of

<EOS>
You
shall
hear
all
about
it
next
mornin

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
had
you
not
better
have
some
assistance

Jacob
?

Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
Suchattempts

always
made
with
sufficient
force
to
ensure
theirexecution

<EOS>
""I
want
no

replied
Jacob
"
not
<EOS>
I.
Half
a
dozen
of

emmay
come
if
they
choose

came

<EOS>
""I
think
you
may
rely
upon
Jacob
,
niece

"
observed
Mrs.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
Hilda
thought
so
too
,
and
it
was
therefore
resolved
that
nothing
shouldbe
said
to
the
miser
on
the
subject
,
but
that
the
porter
should
keepwatch
in
his
own
way
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Mr.
Scarve
came
home
.
<EOS>
The
daypassed
off
as
usual
,
and
Hilda
and
her
aunt
retired
to
rest
early
--
<EOS>
asignal
of
intelligence
passing
between
them
and
Jacob
as
they
withdrew
.
<EOS>
It
so
happened
,
on
this
particular
night
,
that
the
miser
,
who
was
busywith
his
papers
and
accounts
,
signified
his
intention
of
sitting
uplate
,
and
ordered
Jacob
to
place
another
farthing
candle
before
him
,
tobe
lighted
when
the
first
was
done
.
<EOS>
This
arrangement
not
suiting
Jacobat
all
,
he
declined
obeying
the
order
,
hoping
his
master
would
go
tobed
;
but
he
was
mistaken
.
<EOS>
The
miser
continued
busily
employed
until
hiscandle
had
burnt
into
the
socket
,
when
finding
that
Jacob
had
neglectedto
provide
him
with
another
,
he
went
grumblingly
to
the
cupboard
for
it
.
<EOS>
Hearing
him
stir
,
Jacob
,
who
was
on
the
alert
,
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
Do
youknow
it
's
eleven
o'clock
,
sir
?
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
time
to
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
""Go
to
bed
yourself
,
you
careless
rascal
!
"
rejoined
the
miser
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"I
told
you
I
was
going
to
sit
up
,
and
ordered
you
to
get
me
anothercandle
.
<EOS>
But
you
neglect
everything
--
everything
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
I
do
n't
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
"
You
're
growin
'
wasteful
,
and
it'smy
duty
to
check
you
.
<EOS>
You
're
hurtin
'
your
eyes
by
sittin
'
up
so
late
.
<EOS>
Come
,
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
the
devil
's
the
meaning
of
this
,
rascal
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
miser
,
sharplyand
suspiciously
.
<EOS>
"
You
've
some
object
in
view
,
and
want
to
get
me
out
ofthe
way
.
<EOS>
I
shall
sit
up
late
--
perhaps
all
night
.
<EOS>
"Seeing
<EOS>
his
master
resolute
,
Jacob
,
after
muttering
a
few
inaudiblewords
,
withdrew
.
<EOS>
In
an
hour
he
partly
opened
the
door
,
and
popped
hishead
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
The
miser
was
still
hard
at
work
.
<EOS>
"Past
twelve
o'clock
,
and
a
cloudy
mornin
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
mimicking
thehoarse
tones
of
a
watchman
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
still
up
!
"
cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
Get
to
bed
directly
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
sha
n't
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
pushing
the
door
wide
open
,
and
stridinginto
the
room
;
"
it
's
not
safe
to
leave
you
up
.
<EOS>
Them
accounts
can
just
aswell
be
settled
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
Come
,
"
he
added
,
marching
to
the
table
,
andtaking
up
the
candle
,
"
I
'll
see
you
to
bed
.
<EOS>
""Set
<EOS>
down
the
candle
,
rascal
!
"
cried
the
miser
,
rising
in
a
fury--"setit
down
instantly
,
or
I
'll
be
the
death
of
you
.
<EOS>
"Jacob
<EOS>
reluctantly
complied
,
and
looked
hard
at
him
,
scratching
his
headas
<EOS>
he
did
so
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
you
've
something
on
your
mind
,
"
cried
the
miser
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"Confess
<EOS>
at
once
that
you
intend
to
rob
and
murder
me
.
<EOS>
Confess
it
,
andI'll
forgive
you
.
<EOS>
""I've
<EOS>
nothin'
to
confess
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
merely
regard
for
yourwelfare
as
keeps
me
up
.
<EOS>
If
you
'd
be
advised
by
me
,
you
'll
go
to
bed
--
butif
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
,
you
must
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
""What
consequences
,
sirrah
?
"
cried
the
miser
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Are
you
masterhere
,
or
am
I?""You
are
,
"
replied
Jacob--"more
's
the
pity
.
<EOS>
If
anythin
'
happens
,
it'snot
my
fault
.
<EOS>
I
've
warned
you
.
<EOS>
""Stay
,
rascal
!
"
<EOS>
vociferated
the
miser
,
who
felt
somewhat
uneasy--"whatdo
you
mean
?
<EOS>
what
do
you
apprehend?""I
sha'n't
tell
you
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
be
as
close
asyou
.
<EOS>
You
'll
know
if
you
stay
up
long
enough
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
he
disappeared
.
<EOS>
The
miser
was
seriously
alarmed
.
<EOS>
Jacob
's
mysterious
conduct
was
whollyincomprehensible
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
acted
so
before
,
and
after
debating
withhimself
what
it
would
be
best
to
do
,
Mr.
Scarve
resolved
to
fetch
hissword
,
and
remain
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
crept
up
-
stairs
,
andpossessed
himself
of
the
weapon
,
and
as
he
passed
the
ladies
'
chamber
,
on
his
return
,
he
heard
them
stirring
within
it
,
while
the
voice
of
Mrs
.
Clinton
issuing
from
the
keyhole
,
said
,
"
Jacob
,
have
they
been
here?""Not
yet
,
"
replied
the
miser
in
a
whisper
,
which
he
tried
to
make
aslike
the
porter
's
gruff
voice
as
possible
.
<EOS>
Fully
satisfied
that
he
had
discovered
a
plot
,
but
fearful
of
beingsubjected
to
further
interrogations
,
which
might
lead
to
his
discovery
,
if
he
stayed
longer
,
the
miser
hurried
down
stairs
,
muttering
as
hewent--"Here
's
a
pretty
piece
of
work
!
<EOS>
That
rascal
Jacob
is
at
the
bottomof
it
all
.
<EOS>
I
'll
discharge
him
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
But
first
,
to
find
outwhat
it
means
.
<EOS>
How
lucky
I
chanced
to
sit
up
!
<EOS>
It
's
quite
providential
.
<EOS>
"Resuming
<EOS>
his
seat
at
the
table
<EOS>
,
he
placed
the
sword
before
him
,
and
wenton
with
his
accounts
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
left
partially
ajar
,
so
that
,
beingvery
quick
of
hearing
,
he
could
detect
the
slightest
sound
.
<EOS>
One
o'clock
,
however
,
arrived
,
and
the
house
remained
undisturbed
.
<EOS>
Another
half
hourpassed
by
--
still
,
no
one
came
.
<EOS>
His
second
candle
had
burnt
low
,
and
hewas
calculating
with
himself
whether
he
should
light
a
third
,
or
remainin
the
dark
,
when
footsteps
were
distinctly
heard
on
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
Hesnatched
up
the
sword
,
and
rushed
to
the
door
,
where
he
encounteredJacob
with
his
crabstick
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
I
've
caught
you
,
rascal
,
have
I
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
seizing
him
,
andplacing
the
sword
at
his
throat
.
<EOS>
"Leave
go
!
"
<EOS>
said
Jacob
,
dashing
him
off
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
you
hear
'em
?
<EOS>
They'vecome
to
carry
off
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
snatching
the
candle
from
him
,
hedarted
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
miser
's
house
consisted
of
two
stories
,
exclusive
of
the
attics
.
<EOS>
Hisown
bed
-
room
and
that
of
his
daughter
lay
on
the
second
floor
.
<EOS>
Theattics
were
wholly
unoccupied
,
and
filled
with
old
lumber
,
which
no
onebut
himself
would
have
harboured
.
<EOS>
The
doors
were
kept
constantly
locked
,
and
the
windows
boarded
up
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
evident
that
the
parties
who
hadgot
into
the
house
,
had
effected
an
entrance
from
the
roof
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Jacob
soon
after
found
this
to
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
landing
,
heperceived
three
masked
figures
descending
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
ofthem
,
a
slightly
built
person
,
rather
gaily
attired
,
and
provided
with
alantern
,
turned
to
his
companion
,
and
said
,
"
'
<EOS>
Pon
rep
!
<EOS>
we
're
discovered
,
and
had
better
beat
a
retreat
.
<EOS>
"The
person
behind
him
,
however
,
who
was
a
stout
-
built
fellow
,
seemed
tobe
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
"No
,
curse
it
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
"
we
wo
n't
go
back
empty
-
handed
.
<EOS>
He
is
butone
man
,
and
we
'll
carry
her
off
in
spite
of
him
.
<EOS>
Lead
us
to
MissScarve
's
chamber
directly
,
sirrah
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
to
Jacob
,
"
or
we
'll
cutyour
throat
.
<EOS>
""Oppose
<EOS>
us
not
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
the
first
speaker
,
"
we
mean
you
noharm
,
'
<EOS>
pon
rep
!
<EOS>
Our
business
is
with
your
young
mistress
.
<EOS>
Conduct
us
toher
chamber
,
and
you
shall
have
a
crown
for
your
trouble
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
a
cracked
crown
for
yours
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
,
bringing
downhis
crabstick
with
such
force
,
that
if
it
had
hit
its
mark
,
it
wouldhave
more
than
realized
his
threat
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
a
quick
spring
saved
theparty
against
whom
it
was
aimed
.
<EOS>
He
let
fall
the
lantern
,
and
ran
up
thestairs
.
<EOS>
The
person
behind
him
,
uttering
a
tremendous
oath
,
drew
hissword
,
and
made
a
thrust
at
Jacob
,
who
parried
it
with
his
crabstick
,
and
in
his
turn
dealt
his
assailant
a
blow
on
the
arm
that
disabled
him
.
<EOS>
Howling
with
pain
,
and
venting
the
most
terrible
imprecations
,
thefellow
turned
and
fled
,
and
the
third
person
seeing
the
fate
that
hadattended
his
companions
,
followed
their
example
.
<EOS>
Darting
up
stairs
,
theypassed
through
an
open
door
in
the
attics
,
scrambled
over
a
heap
oflumber
,
and
got
through
a
small
dormer
window
.
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
for
the
fugitives
that
Jacob
,
who
was
close
at
theirheels
,
got
entangled
in
the
lumber
,
or
they
might
not
have
escaped
soeasily
.
<EOS>
When
he
extricated
himself
,
they
were
gone
,
nor
could
hediscover
any
trace
of
them
.
<EOS>
It
appeared
probable
that
they
had
passedover
to
the
roof
of
the
adjoining
house
,
and
dropped
upon
some
leads
,
whence
they
had
gained
a
passage
which
was
concealed
from
view
.
<EOS>
Thinkingit
unnecessary
to
pursue
them
further
,
Jacob
fastened
the
window
,
anddescended
to
the
lower
part
of
the
house
,
where
he
found
the
miser
,
together
with
Hilda
and
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
you
have
secured
them
?
"
cried
Mr.
Scarve
.
"
<EOS>
Hilda
has
told
me
whatit
all
means
.
<EOS>
""No
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
fairly
routed
them
.
<EOS>
""Who
was
the
leader
?
"
cried
the
miser--"Randulph
Crew?""More
likely
your
nephew
,
"
returned
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
ca
n't
swear
to
anyone
.
<EOS>
There
was
three
of
'em
,
and
they
was
all
masked
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
owe
you
a
thousand
thanks
for
my
preservation
,
Jacob
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"You
may
now
rest
in
safety
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
fastened
the
window
,
and
I
warrant
me
they
wo
n't
make
a
second
attempt
.
<EOS>
"Repeating
<EOS>
her
thanks
,
Hilda
then
retired
with
her
aunt
.
<EOS>
"Have
<EOS>
you
<EOS>
no
idea
who
it
was
?
"
said
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
the
least
,
"
returned
the
other
;
"
and
I
'm
only
sorry
I
couldn'tidentify
Mr.
Frewin
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
made
no
reply
,
and
whatever
his
suspicions
might
be
,
he
keptthem
to
himself
.
<EOS>
The
attempt
,
however
,
alarmed
him
on
another
account
.
<EOS>
If
this
house
,
which
he
had
considered
securely
barricaded
,
could
be
soeasily
entered
,
other
equally
lawless
characters
,
and
whose
aim
might
beplunder
,
could
obtain
admission
.
<EOS>
He
had
large
sums
with
him
,
for
withthe
true
avaricious
spirit
,
he
loved
to
see
and
to
handle
his
gold
,
andnot
even
the
loss
of
interest
could
induce
him
to
part
with
it
.
<EOS>
Resolving
to
hide
his
treasure
where
it
could
not
be
discovered
,
on
thefollowing
night
,
when
he
concluded
all
were
at
rest
,
he
crept
stealthilydown
stairs
with
two
heavy
money
-
bags
on
his
back
.
<EOS>
With
some
effort
,
forthe
lock
was
very
rusty
,
he
opened
the
door
of
an
old
disused
winecellar
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
in
it
but
an
empty
barrel
,
which
lay
in
onecorner
.
<EOS>
Having
looked
anxiously
round
,
to
see
that
he
was
not
watched
,
he
laid
down
the
bags
,
and
crept
up
stairs
for
two
more
.
<EOS>
These
wereheavier
than
the
first
,
and
he
laid
them
down
with
as
little
noise
aspossible
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
go
back
a
third
time
,
and
returned
equally
laden
.
<EOS>
Hethen
repaired
to
a
small
coal
-
hole
adjoining
,
where
was
deposited
ascanty
supply
of
fuel
,
which
scanty
as
it
was
,
he
intended
should
lastfor
many
months
to
come
,
and
provided
himself
with
a
shovel
and
an
oldbroom
.
<EOS>
A
fourth
ascent
supplied
him
with
a
box
,
in
which
he
placed
thebags
,
and
he
then
commenced
operations
upon
the
floor
of
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
With
great
difficulty
,
for
he
worked
with
the
utmost
caution
,
he
got
outa
few
bricks
,
and
then
his
task
became
easier
.
<EOS>
Having
made
a
holesufficiently
deep
to
hold
the
box
,
he
deposited
it
within
it
,
andcovering
it
over
with
earth
,
restored
the
bricks
as
well
as
he
could
totheir
places
,
jumping
upon
them
and
pressing
them
down
with
his
feet
.
<EOS>
Lastly
,
he
swept
all
the
loose
earth
together
,
and
tossed
it
into
theempty
barrel
.
<EOS>
More
than
an
hour
was
thus
employed
,
and
when
all
was
over
,
he
leanedagainst
the
wall
in
a
complete
state
of
exhaustion
.
<EOS>
While
thus
restinghimself
,
his
eye
wandered
to
the
door
,
which
was
slightly
ajar
,
and
hethought
he
perceived
some
one
behind
it
.
<EOS>
Instantly
darting
towards
it
,
he
threw
it
wide
open
,
and
beheld
Jacob
.
"Villain
!
<EOS>
"
he
shrieked
,
raising
his
shovel
,
"
I
'll
murder
you!""No
,
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
dauntlessly
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
have
you
seen
,
rascal
?
"
<EOS>
cried
the
miser
,
trembling
with
fury
.
<EOS>
"Tell
me
<EOS>
that
--
speak!""Put
down
the
shovel
,
and
then
I
will
,
but
not
otherwise
,
"
answeredJacob
.
"
<EOS>
Well
,
then
,
"
he
added
,
as
the
request
was
complied
with
,
"
I'veseen
you
bury
a
box
.
<EOS>
""You
have
!
"
screamed
the
miser
.
"
<EOS>
And
you
know
what
it
contains?""I
do
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
Some
one
always
sees
these
things
;
and
it
's
wellfor
you
,
and
those
to
come
after
you,--that
,
in
this
case
,
it
was
anhonest
man
like
me
.
<EOS>
""An
honest
man
!
"
cried
the
miser
,
ironically
.
<EOS>
"
Such
a
one
would
beasleep
in
his
bed
at
this
hour
,
and
not
prying
into
his
master'saffairs
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
should
his
master
be
doin'
,
eh
?
"
<EOS>
retorted
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
Should
n't
hebe
in
bed
,
too
,
instead
o
'
creepin
'
about
his
house
as
if
he
was
doin'some
guilty
deed
,
and
afraid
<EOS>
o
'
bein
'
detected
?
<EOS>
Which
is
worse
,
him
asburies
money
,
or
him
as
looks
on
while
its
buried
?
<EOS>
I
tell
you
what
itis
,
sir,--in
my
opinion
,
he
who
acts
so
deserves
to
be
robbed
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
I'mnot
goin'
to
rob
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
afraid
!
<EOS>
But
I
repeat
,
you
deserve
to
berobbed
.
<EOS>
What
was
money
made
for?--not
to
be
buried
there
.
<EOS>
Spend
it
,
andgive
yourself
comfort
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
many
years
to
live
;
and
then
you
maybe
put
where
you
've
put
your
gold
.
<EOS>
But
I
preach
to
a
deaf
ear
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
Jacob
was
speaking
,
the
miser
remained
leaning
on
the
shovel
,
asif
considering
what
he
should
do
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
groaned
out--"Well
<EOS>
,
you've
baffled
my
design
,
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Dig
up
the
chest!""No
<EOS>
I
wo
n't
,
"
was
the
surly
reply
.
<EOS>
"You
won't?""No
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
"
I
'll
not
be
art
or
part
in
anythin
'
of
the
sort
.
<EOS>
He
as
hides
may
find
.
<EOS>
Since
you
've
buried
the
treasure
,
e'en
let
itrest
.
<EOS>
The
secret
's
safe
with
me
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
swear
it
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
miser
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
,
if
that
'll
content
you
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"I'll
trust
you
,
then
,
"
rejoined
Scarve
.
<EOS>
"Only
because
you
ca
n't
help
yourself
,
"
muttered
Jacob
.
<EOS>
The
miser
took
no
notice
of
the
remark
,
but
quitting
the
cellar
,
lockedthe
door
,
and
fastened
the
padlock
outside
.
<EOS>
"You'll
never
enter
this
place
without
my
leave
,
Jacob
,
"
he
cried--"norbetray
<EOS>
my
secret?""I've
sworn
it
,
"
replied
the
porter
,
gruffly
.
<EOS>
And
he
turned
off
into
hisown
room
,
while
the
miser
went
up
stairs
with
a
heavy
heart
.
<EOS>
Some
days
after
this
occurrence
,
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
called
uponHilda
.
<EOS>
The
Welsh
baronet
was
rather
a
favourite
with
the
miser
,
forthough
they
had
few
qualities
in
common
,
yet
Sir
Norfolk
's
peculiarcharacter
suited
him
.
<EOS>
He
never
asked
a
favour
--
never
wanted
to
borrowmoney
--
never
required
any
refreshment
.
<EOS>
All
these
circumstancesrecommended
him
to
the
miser
's
good
opinion
.
<EOS>
With
Hilda
he
was
a
stillgreater
favourite
.
<EOS>
She
liked
his
stately
,
old
-
fasnioned
manner
;
andthough
she
could
have
dispensed
with
some
of
his
formality
,
shepreferred
it
to
the
familiarity
of
the
few
persons
of
quality
whom
shehad
encountered
.
<EOS>
On
the
present
occasion
,
after
much
circumlocution
,
Sir
Norfolk
informedthe
miser
that
there
was
to
be
a
masquerade
,
or
,
as
he
termed
it
,
"
agrand
assemblage
of
personated
characters
in
masks
,
"
in
a
few
days
atRanelagh
,
and
he
begged
to
be
permitted
to
take
his
daughter
to
it
.
<EOS>
"It
is
a
useless
expense
,
"
muttered
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"I
confess
<EOS>
I
should
like
to
go
very
much
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
neverseen
a
masquerade
;
and
I
am
told
those
at
Ranelagh
are
magnificent
.
<EOS>
""This
will
be
unusually
magnificent
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
;
"
and
as
youhave
expressed
a
wish
on
the
subject
,
I
will
procure
you
a
masqueradinghabit
,
and
a
ticket
,
if
your
father
will
allow
you
to
go
.
<EOS>
""In
<EOS>
that
case
<EOS>
I
see
no
objection
,
"
said
the
miser
,
"
provided
I
am
notobliged
to
accompany
her
.
<EOS>
I
abominate
such
fooleries
.
<EOS>
""I
will
gladly
undertake
the
curation
of
her
,
"
said
Sir
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
are
the
only
man
I
would
trust
her
with
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
rejoinedScarve
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
you
will
take
as
much
care
of
her
as
I
could
myself
.
"Sir
<EOS>
Norfolk
acknowledged
the
compliment
by
a
stately
bow
.
<EOS>
And
it
wasthen
arranged
,
to
Hilda
's
great
satisfaction
,
that
a
court
dressmakershould
wait
upon
her
on
the
following
day
,
to
prepare
her
a
dress
forthe
masquerade
.
<EOS>
All
were
pleased
with
the
arrangement
;
and
the
miser
wasin
high
glee
that
he
had
obliged
his
daughter
without
putting
himself
totrouble
or
expense
;
while
Sir
Norfolk
was
equally
gratified
in
beingable
to
afford
pleasure
to
his
fair
cousin

JUKES
VISITS
<EOS>
THE
WIDOW.Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
still
continued
unremitting
in
his
attentions
to
Mrs
.
Nettleship
,
and
had
made
such
progress
in
her
affections
,
that
on
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
's
return
from
the
country
--
an
event
which
occurred
about
tendays
after
the
memorable
visit
to
Marylebone
Gardens
<EOS>
--
she
told
him
shefeared
<EOS>
she
could
not
fulfil
her
engagement
with
him
,
and
besought
him
toallow
her
to
break
it
off
.
<EOS>
But
Mr.
Rathbone
declared
he
would
do
no
suchthing
,
and
reminded
her
of
a
trifling
penalty
of
three
thousand
poundswhich
was
attached
to
the
violation
of
the
marriage
contract
on
herpart
.
<EOS>
He
then
upbraided
her
warmly
with
inconstancy
;
recalled
to
herrecollection
the
professions
of
regard
she
had
once
expressed
for
him;and
concluded
by
vowing
to
be
the
death
of
his
rival
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nettleshipbore
his
reproaches
with
the
utmost
composure
;
but
on
hearing
his
finalthreat
,
she
uttered
a
faint
scream
,
and
sank
overcome
by
emotion
into
achair
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone
offered
her
no
assistance
;
but
clapping
his
hatfiercely
on
his
head
,
and
flourishing
his
stick
in
a
menacing
manner
,
hurried
out
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
la
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
getting
up
as
soon
as
he
was
gone,"there
will
be
a
duel
--
a
sanguinary
duel
--
and
I
shall
have
caused
it
,
wretched
woman
that
I
am!"But
no
duel
ensued
--
perhaps
to
the
widow
's
disappointment
.
<EOS>
On
being
madeacquainted
with
the
precise
terms
of
the
contract
,
of
which
he
hadhitherto
been
kept
in
ignorance
,
Mr.
Cripps
looked
very
grave
,
andadvised
her
on
no
account
to
come
to
a
decided
rupture
with
Mr
.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
three
thousand
pounds
can
make
no
difference
to
you
,
Mr
.
Willars
,
"
said
Mrs.
Nettleship--"better
pay
it
,
and
have
done
with
him
.
<EOS>
""On
no
account
,
my
angel
,
"
replied
her
admirer
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
manage
tooutwit
him
,
and
obtain
his
consent
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
strange
to
say
,
the
cunning
valet
did
contrive
,
not
only
not
toquarrel
with
his
rival
,
but
even
to
make
a
friend
of
him
.
<EOS>
Foreseeingthat
Mr.
Rathbone
would
infallibly
find
out
who
he
was
,
and
expose
him
,
he
determined
to
be
beforehand
with
him
,
and
he
therefore
told
the
widowthat
he
had
concocted
a
scheme
,
by
which
he
was
certain
of
outwittingher
affianced
suitor
;
but
it
was
necessary
to
its
success
that
he
shouldassume
the
part
of
his
own
valet
,
Crackenthorpe
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
n't
like
the
idea
of
your
being
taken
for
a
walet
at
all
,
Mr
.
Willars
,
"
said
Mrs.
Nettleship--"and
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
see
what
purpose
<EOS>
it'llanswer?""It
is
indispensable
to
my
scheme
,
my
angel
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
Youknow
these
things
are
always
so
managed
in
the
comedies
,
and
they
arethe
best
models
one
can
follow
.
<EOS>
Masters
constantly
put
on
theirservants
'
clothes
,
and
servants
those
of
their
masters
.
<EOS>
Nothing
morecommon
,
both
on
the
stage
and
off
it
.
<EOS>
And
only
think
if
we
can
trick
himout
of
the
three
thousand!""Ah
,
that
would
be
something
,
certainly
,
"
said
Mrs.
Nettleship
.
<EOS>
"
I
musthave
been
a
fool
to
enter
into
such
an
engagement
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
I
lovedhim
then
.
<EOS>
""You
must
indeed
have
been
wanting
in
your
usual
judgment
,
sweetheart,"replied
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
but
you
had
n't
seen
me
.
<EOS>
The
only
course
now
left
isto
out
-
manouvre
the
insensible
dolt
,
and
that
,
depend
upon
it
,
we
'll
do
.
<EOS>
The
idea
of
personating
my
valet
was
suggested
to
me
by
the
address
ofthe
drunken
old
fellow
we
met
in
Marylebone
Gardens
.
<EOS>
""I
recollect
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Nettleship
.
"
<EOS>
He
called
you
his
nephew
--
saidyour
name
was
Cripps
--
and
that
you
were
Mr.
Willars
's
walet
.
<EOS>
I
rememberit
as
well
as
if
it
had
happened
yesterday
.
<EOS>
""Disagreeable
<EOS>
occurrences
always
dwell
in
one
's
remembrance
longer
thanpleasant
ones
,
"
rejoined
the
valet
,
forcing
a
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
introduceme
to
Mr.
Rathbone
as
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
Leave
him
to
find
out
the
rest
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
device
worked
exactly
as
its
contriver
desired
and
anticipated
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
was
astounded
when
he
learnt
that
his
rival
was
a
valet
;
and
hewas
so
staggered
by
Mr.
Cripps
's
dress
,
assurance
,
and
deportment
,
thathe
was
firmly
convinced
he
was
a
gentleman
in
disguise
.
<EOS>
The
inquiries
hemade
only
added
to
his
perplexity
.
<EOS>
He
ascertained
that
Beau
Villiers
hada
valet
named
Cripps
;
but
the
description
given
of
him
did
not
tallywith
the
appearance
of
Mrs.
Nettleship
's
lover
,
and
at
last
he
becamesatisfied
that
the
interloper
was
the
master
and
not
the
man
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
tell
you
what
,
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
"
he
said
one
day
,
"
this
gay
admirerof
yours
is
n't
what
he
pretends
to
be
.
<EOS>
""Indeed
,
Mr.
Rathbone
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
widow
,
smiling
<EOS>
"
What
is
he
,
then?""A
<EOS>
great
rake
and
a
coxcomb
,
"
replied
the
other
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
his
ownmaster
.
<EOS>
No
,
I
do
n't
mean
that
exactly
--
he
's
disguised
as
hiswalet
<EOS>
--
that
's
it
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
do
you
mean
,
Mr.
Rathbone
?
"
simpered
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
declare
I
don'tunderstand
you

<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
I
mean
that
this
walet

Cripps

you
suppose
him

replied
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
Mr.
Willars

the
great
beau

<EOS>
""Oh
,
you
're
entirely
mistaken

Mr.
Rathbone

"
said
the
widow
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
he
means
honorably
by
you
,
that
's
all
,
"
sneered
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah!here
he
comes
,
"
he
added
,
as
Mr.
Cripps
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
mostobedient
,
Mr.
Willars
.
<EOS>
""My

repliedthe
valet
,
with
a
smirk
of
satisfaction

<EOS>
"Poh

!
<EOS>
nonsense!--don't

cried
Rathbone--"I

impose
on
me

<EOS>
I
know
a

<EOS>
I
see
him

<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
opinion
is
too
flattering
,
sir
,
to
allow
me
to
be
angry
at
it,"replied
Mr.
Cripps
,
bowing
profoundly
.
<EOS>
"There!--that
bow
alone
would
convict
you

"
cried
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Who

his
honours
in
that
style?""Do
<EOS>
me
the
favour
to
try
my
snush

said
Mr.
Cripps
,
taking
out
thebeau
's
handsomest
box
,
which
he
had
borrowed
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
"Further
proof
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Rathbone
;
"
look
at
that
snuff
box
set
withbrilliants!--those
rings
on
his
fingers!--Very
like
a
walet
,
indeed
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
have
it
all
your
own
way
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr.
Cripps
,
againbowing
:
"
<EOS>
but
there
's
an
old
gentleman
outside
,
who
will
tell
you
you
aremistaken

<EOS>
""An
accomplice
,
I
'll
be
sworn

"
cried
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
should
like
tosee
him

"
and
proceeding
to
the
passage
,
he
returned
the
next
momentwith
Mr.
Jukes
,
while
Mr.
Cripps
seated
himself
,
and
winkedsignificantly
at
the
widow

<EOS>
On
entering
the
room
,
the
old
butler
glancedround
it
curiously
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
sir
,
you
look
like
a
servant
,
at
all
events
,
"
cried
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"Pray
who
is
the
individual
before
<EOS>
us?--who
is
he?""I'm
sorry
to
betray
him
,
because
he
's
my
own
kinsman

"
replied
Mr
.
Jukes
;
"
but
I
can
not
suffer
him
to
impose
on
a
respectable
lady
.
<EOS>
""Who
<EOS>
do
you
say
he
is
?
"
demanded
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
repeat
,
I
'm
sorry
to
expose
him

replied
Mr.
Jukes

but
the
truthmust
be
told

<EOS>
He
's
my

<EOS>
""There

with

glance
at

<EOS>
"Why

,
does
he
own
that
his

said
the
butler
,
inastonishment

<EOS>
"He
would
make
us
believe
so

"
replied
Rathbone
;
"

"The

butler
looked
thoroughly
mystified

<EOS>
"'Pon

<EOS>
this
is
vastly
amusing

"
said
Mr.
Cripps
,
(
helping
himself
toa
pinch
of
snuff
)
and
clearing
his
point
-
laced
cravat
from
the
dust
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
you
,
ma'am
,
are
aware
of
the
real
name
of
this
young
man
?
"
<EOS>
saidMr

<EOS>
Jukes
,
turning
to
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"Perfectly
<EOS>
aware
of
it
<EOS>
,
"
she
replied
,
significantly
.
"And
<EOS>
so
am
I

added
Rathbone
,
coughing
drily

<EOS>
"
We
're
all
aware
ofit

all

<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
've
nothing
further
to
say

"
returned
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
Whateverconstruction

upon
my

Crackenthorpe

I
only
came
hereto
serve
you

<EOS>
""No

my

no

"
replied
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
But
do

deceived
me

<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
that
I
've
convinced
the

I
'm
perfectly
satisfied

"
said
Mr

Jukes
,
taking
his
leave
.
<EOS>
"Very
<EOS>
well
contrived
,
Mr.
Willars
--
exceedingly
well
,
sir

"
saidRathbone
;
"
but
it
wo
nt
do
.
<EOS>
I
saw
at
once
he
was
one
of
your
people
.
<EOS>
""You
are
a
man
of
great
discernment
,
truly
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
Praytake
a
pinch

snush

""I'm
<EOS>
afraid
you
spend
your

"
laughed
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
Andplunging
his

into
the
box
,
he
quitted
the
room
,
chuckling
tohimself
.
<EOS>
"Capitally
<EOS>
done

'
pon
rep

"
cried
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
The
old
fellow
couldn'thave
played
his
part
better
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
was
he
really
engaged
to
do
it
?
"
said
Mrs.
Nettleship
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
Ideclare
he
quite
took
me
in
.
<EOS>
But
you
see
Mr.
Rathbone
is
too
good
ajudge
to
be
imposed
upon
.
<EOS>
He
knows
the
true
gentleman
when
he
sees
him
.
<EOS>
""All
is
going
exactly
as
I
could
wish
it
,
my
angel
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
a
month
has
passed
,
I
'll
make
him
give
up
the
contract
.
<EOS>
""Heigho
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
widow
,
"
I
wish
the
month
was
over
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
had
thus
completely
accomplished
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
His
rival
hadmade
up
his
mind
that
he
was
Mr.
Villiers
;
and
he
was
one
of
thoseobstinate
persons
who
always
persist
in
an
error
,
even
against
theevidence
of
their
senses
.
<EOS>
The
valet
took
care
to
humour
the
idea
.
<EOS>
Whilepersisting
in
giving
his
real
name
,
and
representing
himself
in
his
truecharacter
,
Mr.
Cripps
demeaned
himself
in
such
sort
as
to
leave
no
doubtin
the
mind
of
the
sagacious
tallow
-
chandler
that
his
actual
rank
andposition
were
widely
different
.
<EOS>
Nothing
,
however
,
surprised
the
valetmore
than
the
kindly
manner
in
which
his
rival
behaved
to
him
.
<EOS>
So
farwas
this
carried
,
that
he
began
to
suspect
some
treachery
might
beintended
against
himself
,
and
resolved
to
be
on
his
guard
.
<EOS>
But
whatever
secret
opinions
the
rivals
might
entertain
of
each
other
,
ostensibly
they
were
excellent
friends
,
and
constantly
went
to
places
ofamusement
together
.
<EOS>
When
the
masquerade
at
Ranelagh
was
announced
,
Mrs
.
Nettleship
instantly
signified
her
intention
of
attending
it
,
and
Mr
.
Cripps
,
emboldened
by
his
former
good
luck
,
unhesitatingly
undertook
toescort
her
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone
,
of
course
,
was
included
in
the
party
,
and
henot
only
begged
to
be
permitted
to
pay
for
the
tickets
,
but
to
give
thema
supper
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
With
apparent
reluctance
,
Mr.
Cripps
assentedto
the
proposal
;
and
they
then
arranged
the
characters
they
shouldrepresent
.
<EOS>
The
valet
,
being
an
excellent
dancer
,
thought
he
shouldappear
to
advantage
as
harlequin
;
and
as
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
notwithstanding
her
bulk
,
still
boasted
considerable
agility
,
shereadily
undertook
to
play
columbine
.
<EOS>
The
part
of
the
hump
-
backed
loverwas
offered
to
Mr.
Rathbone
,
and
accepted
by
him
.
<EOS>
There
were
yet
two
other
persons
whom
the
irresistible
masqueradethreatened
to
draw
into
its
vortex
.
<EOS>
These
were
the
fair
Thomasine
andPeter
Pokerich
.
<EOS>
For
more
than
two
years
the
mercer
's
daughter
had
beendying
to
see
a
masquerade
;
and
the
moment
she
heard
of
the
grandentertainment
in
question
,
she
attacked
her
father
on
the
subject
,
andnever
allowed
him
to
rest
till
he
promised
to
let
her
go
.
<EOS>
Peter
Pokerichrequired
no
solicitation
to
induce
him
to
accompany
her
,
being
as
eageras
herself
for
the
spectacle
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
had
imparted
to
him
his
design
,
and
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
all
go
together
.
<EOS>
Only
onedifficulty
existed,--namely
,
that
the
fair
Thomasine
had
selected
thesame
character
as
the
widow
.
<EOS>
But
this
objection
was
got
over
by
Mr
.
Cripps
,
who
declared
he
could
do
very
well
with
two
columbines
.
<EOS>
Thelittle
barber
himself
would
have
preferred
playing
harlequin
,
but
as
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
had
appropriated
the
part
,
he
was
obliged
to
be
content
with
thatof
clown
.

CHAPTER
VIII.--THE
MASQUERADE
AT
RANELAGH
,
WITH
THE
VARIOUS
INCIDENTS
THAT
OCCURRED
ATIT.At
length
the
day
so
much
wished
for
by
the
principal
personages
in
thishistory
,
and
by
many
hundreds
besides
,
arrived
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
secondThursday
in
July
,
and
a
more
joyous
and
auspicious
day
never
ushered
ina
festival
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
more
fortunate
,
because
the
early
part
of
theentertainment
was
to
take
place
out
of
doors
.
<EOS>
The
fete
commenced
at
twoo'clock
;
but
long
before
that
hour
,
the
road
to
Chelsea
was
crowded
withcoaches
,
chariots
,
chairs
,
and
vehicles
of
every
description
.
<EOS>
The
river
,
too
,
was
thronged
with
boats
freighted
with
masquers
,
and
presented
amost
lively
appearance
from
the
multitudes
of
spectators
drawn
forth
bythe
fineness
of
the
day
,
and
the
gaiety
of
the
scene
,
which
vied
insplendour
with
a
Venetian
carnival
.
<EOS>
Having
decided
upon
going
by
water
,
Mr.
Cripps
and
his
party
leftBilliter
-
square
about
one
o'clock
,
and
embarked
in
a
tilt
-
boat
,
rowed
bya
couple
of
watermen
,
at
Old
Swan
Stairs
,
near
London
Bridge
.
<EOS>
They
wereall
,
of
course
,
in
their
masquerade
attire
,
Mr.
Cripps
being
arrayed
inthe
parti
-
coloured
garb
of
the
hero
of
pantomine,--which
differed
onlyin
some
immaterial
points
,
such
as
the
looseness
of
the
pantaloons
atthe
ancle
,
and
the
amplitude
of
the
shirt
collar
,
from
the
garb
of
themodern
harlequin
.
<EOS>
He
was
provided
with
a
wand
,
and
his
face
wasconcealed
by
a
close
black
vizard
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone
had
a
large
hump
on
hisshoulders
,
like
that
of
Punch
(
whom
,
by
-
the
-
by
,
his
figure
greatlyresembled
)
,
a
well
-
stuffed
paunch
,
a
large
protuberance
behind
,
shoeswith
immense
roses
in
them
,
a
tall
sugar
-
loaf
hat
,
and
a
mask
,
with
agreat
hooked
nose
and
chin
.
<EOS>
He
carried
,
moreover
,
a
stout
knobbed
stick
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
lady
,
her
goodly
person
was
invested
in
a
white
satin
habit
,
glistening
with
spangles
,
and
flounced
with
garlands
of
flowers
.
<EOS>
She
hadshort
sleeves
,
with
deep
falls
of
lace
to
them,--satin
shoes
,
<EOS>
braidedwith
silver
cord,--a
pearl
necklace
round
her
throat
,
and
a
wreath
ofartificial
roses
upon
her
head
.
<EOS>
She
declined
hiding
her
features
behinda
mask
,
which
Mr.
Cripps
declared
was
excessively
kind
and
considerate
.
<EOS>
Their
passage
along
the
river
was
delightful
,
Mr.
Cripps
being
soexcited
that
he
could
not
be
content
to
remain
under
the
tilt
,
butdisplayed
himself
in
the
fore
part
of
the
boat
,
ogling
all
the
prettiestdamsels
among
the
spectators
,
retorting
the
jests
of
their
malecompanions
,
and
,
whenever
an
opportunity
offered
,
dealing
them
a
heartythwack
with
his
wand
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nettleship
did
not
altogether
relish
theseproceedings
,
but
Mr.
Rathbone
enjoyed
them
amazingly
,
and
laid
about
himright
and
left
,
like
his
rival
,
with
his
knobbed
stick
.
<EOS>
On
landing
at
Chelsea
,
they
met
,
according
to
appointment
,
the
littlebarber
and
his
companion
.
<EOS>
The
fair
Thomasine
looked
uncommonly
pretty
.
<EOS>
She
had
on
a
gown
of
yellow
and
silver
,
spangled
like
the
widow
's
,
andadorned
with
garlands
of
flowers
,
with
a
bodice
of
pink
satin
,
crossedwith
ribands
of
the
same
colour
.
<EOS>
Round
her
throat
<EOS>
she
wore
a
chain
ofgold
,
from
which
depended
an
imitation
diamond
solitaire
,
and
her
richauburn
tresses
were
covered
with
the
prettiest
little
coquettish
hatimaginable
.
<EOS>
Her
dress
was
purposely
made
short
,
so
as
to
display
hersmall
feet
and
ankles
.
<EOS>
From
the
same
motive
also
as
the
widow
,
shedeclined
wearing
a
mask
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
was
quite
captivated
by
her
,
andclaiming
the
privilege
of
his
character
,
took
her
from
the
barber
,
andoffered
her
his
unoccupied
arm
.
<EOS>
Peter
Pokerich
wore
a
scull
cap
,
covered
with
red
and
white
worsted
,
arranged
somewhat
like
a
cock's
-
comb
,
a
large
ruff
,
a
red
calicodoublet
,
white
slashed
calico
drawers
,
with
huge
bunches
of
ribands
atthe
knees
,
and
pink
silk
hose
.
<EOS>
His
face
was
painted
in
red
and
whitestreaks
.
<EOS>
Like
the
others
,
he
was
in
tip
-
top
spirits
;
and
the
whole
partyproceeded
to
Ranelagh
,
which
was
not
far
distant
,
laughing
and
jestingwith
each
other
merrily
.
<EOS>
They
found
the
road
from
town
completely
stopped
up
by
a
line
ofcarriages
,
while
the
throng
of
spectators
on
foot
rendered
it
difficultto
get
on
.
<EOS>
The
familiarities
of
the
crowd
were
almost
unsupportable
.
<EOS>
Nota
coach
or
a
chair
was
suffered
to
pass
without
its
occupant
beinginspected
by
the
curious
,
who
,
in
many
cases
,
compelled
those
theyannoyed
to
let
down
the
windows
,
that
they
might
have
a
better
view
oftheir
dresses
.
<EOS>
By
dint
of
elbowing
and
squeezing
,
assisted
by
the
wand
and
knobbedstick
,
the
party
contrived
to
move
slowly
forward
;
and
as
they
did
so
,
they
had
ample
opportunity
of
glancing
at
the
occupants
of
the
differentvehicles
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
very
soon
distinguished
his
master
's
gilt
<EOS>
chariot;but
<EOS>
he
did
not
turn
aside
,
as
his
mask
and
dress
ensured
him
fromdetection
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Nettleship
was
struck
by
the
magnificence
of
theequipage
,
and
recalling
the
features
of
the
beau
,
who
was
wrapped
in
asky
-
blue
domino
,
and
wore
a
Spanish
hat
and
feathers
,
but
kept
his
maskin
his
hand
,
said
,
"
Why
that
's
the
fine
gentleman
who
spoke
to
you
inMary'bone
Gardens
.
<EOS>
What
's
his
name?""Odd
enough
!
<EOS>
the
same
as
my
own
--
Villiers
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
afirst
cousin
of
mine
,
and
we
're
considered
very
much
alike
.
<EOS>
"By
the
side
of
Mr.
Villiers
sat
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
.
<EOS>
The
antiquatedbeau
was
so
metamorphosed
,
that
Mr.
Cripps
scarcely
recognised
him
;
norwould
he
,
perhaps
,
have
done
so
,
if
the
charms
of
the
fair
Thomasine
hadnot
attracted
the
old
coxcomb
's
attention
,
and
caused
him
to
thrust
hishead
out
of
the
window
to
look
at
her
.
<EOS>
Sir
Singleton
,
as
favouring
histurn
for
gallantry
,
had
chosen
the
part
of
Pierrot
,
and
was
habited
inthe
peculiar
vestment
of
white
calico
,
with
long
,
loose
sleeves
,
as
wellas
the
broad
-
leaved
,
high
-
crowned
hat
proper
to
the
character
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
's
carriage
immediately
preceded
that
of
the
beau
,
andcontained
her
ladyship
,
Clementina
,
Trussell
,
and
Randulph
.
<EOS>
Trussell
wasdressed
like
a
Turk
,
and
wore
a
large
turban
,
ornamented
with
acrescent
,
and
a
fine
,
flowing
,
coal
-
black
beard
.
<EOS>
Randulph
did
not
appearin
character
,
but
was
attired
in
a
light
blue
velvet
coat
,
laced
withgold
,
the
work
of
the
French
tailor
,
Desmartins
,
which
displayed
hiselegant
figure
to
the
greatest
advantage
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
put
on
hismask
.
<EOS>
Clementina
was
robed
in
a
pink
silk
domino
,
and
wore
a
blackvelvet
hat
,
looped
with
diamonds
,
and
ornamented
with
a
plume
of
whitefeathers
,
and
really
looked
very
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
wore
a
richsilk
dress
,
embossed
with
gold
and
silver
,
that
suited
her
admirably
.
<EOS>
Next
in
advance
of
Lady
Brabazon
's
carriage
was
that
of
Sir
BulkeleyPrice
.
<EOS>
The
Welsh
Baronet
was
in
his
ordinary
attire
,
but
he
wasaccompanied
by
a
Chinese
Mandarin
,
in
a
loose
gown
of
light
silk
,
girtat
the
middle
with
a
silken
belt
,
and
having
a
conical
cap
,
topped
by
agilded
ball
,
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
This
person
,
notwithstanding
the
disguise
of
along
twisted
beard
,
Mr.
Cripps
knew
to
be
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
Passing
several
other
carriages
filled
with
various
characters
,
theycame
to
an
old
-
fashioned
chariot
,
driven
by
a
coachman
as
ancient
asitself
in
a
faded
livery
,
and
drawn
by
two
meagre
-
looking
,
superannuatedhorses
.
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
its
unpromising
appearance
,
the
occupantsof
this
carriage
attracted
especial
attention
from
the
beholders
,
andmany
and
loud
were
the
exclamations
of
admiration
uttered
by
them
.
<EOS>
"She
is
beautiful
!
"
<EOS>
cried
one
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Enchanting
!
"
cried
another
.
<EOS>
"
By
far
theprettiest
person
who
has
gone
to
the
masquerade
,
"
cried
a
third
.
<EOS>
And
soon
in
the
same
rapturous
strain
.
<EOS>
Excited
by
these
remarks
,
Mr.
Cripps
pressed
forward
to
have
a
peep
intothe
carriage
,
and
found
it
occupied
by
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
and
anexquisitely
beautiful
young
female
,
attired
with
great
simplicity
in
adress
of
white
satin
,
with
wide
short
sleeves
,
as
was
then
the
mode
,
trimmed
with
deep
falls
of
lace
.
<EOS>
A
diamond
necklace
encircled
herthroat
,
and
a
few
natural
flowers
constituted
the
sole
ornaments
of
herdark
abundant
hair
.
<EOS>
It
was
Hilda
Scarve
,
as
Mr.
Cripps
was
instantlyaware
,
though
he
had
scarcely
time
to
look
at
her
,
for
Sir
Norfolk
,
outof
all
patience
with
the
familiarity
of
the
spectators
,
thrust
himforcibly
back
,
and
ordered
the
coachman
,
in
a
peremptory
tone
,
to
driveon
--
an
injunction
with
which
the
old
domestic
found
some
difficulty
incomplying
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
before
entering
Ranelagh
,
it
may
be
proper
to
offer
a
word
asto
its
history
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
for
the
changes
and
caprices
of
fashion
!
<EOS>
Thischarming
place
of
entertainment
,
the
delight
of
our
grandfathers
andgrandmothers
,
the
boast
of
the
metropolis
,
the
envy
of
foreigners
,
therenowned
in
song
and
story
,
the
paradise
of
hoops
and
wigs
,
isvanished,--numbered
with
the
things
that
were!--and
,
we
fear
,
there
<EOS>
islittle
hope
of
its
revival
.
<EOS>
Ranelagh
,
it
is
well
known
,
derived
itsdesignation
from
a
nobleman
of
the
same
name
,
by
whom
the
house
waserected
,
and
the
gardens
,
esteemed
the
most
beautiful
in
the
kingdom
,
originally
laid
out
.
<EOS>
Its
situation
adjoined
the
Royal
Hospital
atChelsea
;
and
the
date
of
its
erection
was
1690
-
1
.
<EOS>
Ranelagh
House
,
on
thedeath
of
the
earl
,
in
1712
,
passed
into
the
possession
of
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Lady
Catherine
Jones
;
but
was
let
,
about
twenty
years
afterwards
,
to
twoeminent
builders
,
who
relet
it
to
Lacy
,
afterwards
patentee
of
DruryLane
Theatre
,
and
commonly
called
Gentleman
Lacy
,
by
whom
it
was
takenwith
the
intention
of
giving
concerts
and
breakfasts
within
it
,
on
ascale
far
superior
,
in
point
of
splendour
and
attraction
,
to
any
thathad
been
hitherto
attempted
.
<EOS>
In
1741
,
the
premises
were
sold
by
Lacy
toMessrs
.
<EOS>
Crispe
and
Meyonnet
for
L.4000
,
and
the
rotunda
was
erected
inthe
same
year
by
subscription
.
<EOS>
From
this
date
,
the
true
history
ofRanelagh
may
be
said
to
commence
.
<EOS>
It
at
once
burst
into
fashion
,
and
itsentertainments
being
attended
by
persons
of
the
first
quality
,
crowdsflocked
in
their
train
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
its
opening
,
Mr.
Crispe
became
thesole
lessee
;
and
in
spite
of
the
brilliant
success
of
the
enterprise
,
shared
the
fate
of
most
lessees
of
places
of
public
amusement
,
beingdeclared
bankrupt
in
1744
.
<EOS>
The
property
was
then
divided
into
thirtyshares
,
and
so
continued
until
Ranelagh
was
closed
.
<EOS>
The
earliestentertainments
of
Ranelagh
were
morning
concerts
,
consisting
chiefly
oforatorios
,
produced
under
the
direction
of
Michael
Festing
,
the
leaderof
the
band
;
but
evening
concerts
were
speedily
introduced
,
the
latter
,
it
may
be
mentioned
,
to
shew
the
difference
of
former
fashionable
hoursfrom
the
present
,
commencing
at
half
-
past
five
,
and
concluding
at
nine
.
<EOS>
Thus
it
began
,
but
towards
its
close
,
the
gayest
visitors
to
Ranelaghwent
at
midnight
,
just
as
the
concerts
were
finishing
,
and
remainedthere
till
three
or
four
in
the
morning
.
<EOS>
In
1754
,
the
fashionable
worldwere
drawn
to
Ranelagh
by
a
series
of
amusements
called
Comus
's
Court;and
notwithstanding
their
somewhat
questionable
title
,
the
revels
wereconducted
with
great
propriety
and
decorum
.
<EOS>
A
procession
which
wasintroduced
was
managed
with
great
effect
,
and
several
mock
Italian
duetswere
sung
with
remarkable
spirit
.
<EOS>
Almost
to
its
close
,
Ranelagh
retainedits
character
of
being
the
finest
place
of
public
entertainment
inEurope
,
and
to
the
last
the
rotunda
was
the
wonder
and
delight
of
everybeholder
.
<EOS>
The
coup
-
d'oeil
of
the
interior
of
this
structure
wasextraordinarily
striking
,
and
impressed
all
who
beheld
it
for
the
firsttime
with
surprise
.
<EOS>
It
was
circular
in
form
,
and
exactly
one
hundred
andfifty
feet
in
diameter
.
<EOS>
Round
the
lower
part
of
the
building
ran
abeautiful
arcade
,
the
intervals
between
each
arch
being
filled
up
byalcoves
.
<EOS>
Over
this
was
a
gallery
with
a
balustrade
,
having
entrancesfrom
the
exterior
,
and
forming
a
sort
of
upper
boxes
.
<EOS>
Above
the
gallerywas
a
range
of
round
-
headed
windows
,
between
each
of
which
was
a
carvedfigure
supporting
the
roof
,
and
forming
the
terminus
of
the
columnbeneath
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
orchestra
was
placed
in
the
centre
of
theamphitheatre
,
but
being
found
exceedingly
inconvenient
,
as
well
asdestructive
of
the
symmetry
of
the
building
in
that
situation
,
it
wasremoved
to
the
side
.
<EOS>
It
contained
a
stage
capable
of
accommodatingthirty
or
forty
chorus
-
singers
.
<EOS>
The
original
site
of
the
orchestra
wasoccupied
by
a
large
chimney
,
having
four
faces
enclosed
in
abeautifully
-
proportioned
hollow
,
hexagonal
column
,
with
arched
openingsat
the
sides
,
and
a
balustrade
at
the
base
.
<EOS>
Richly
moulded
,
andotherwise
ornamented
with
appropriate
designs
,
this
enormous
column
hada
charming
effect
,
and
gave
a
peculiar
character
to
the
wholeamphitheatre
.
<EOS>
A
double
range
of
large
chandeliers
descended
from
theceiling
<EOS>
;
others
were
placed
within
the
column
above
mentioned
,
and
everyalcove
had
its
lamp
.
<EOS>
When
all
these
chandeliers
and
lamps
were
lighted
,
the
effect
was
wonderfully
brilliant
.
<EOS>
The
external
diameter
of
therotunda
was
one
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
feet
.
<EOS>
It
was
surrounded
on
theoutside
by
an
arcade
similar
to
that
within
,
above
which
ran
a
gallery
,
with
a
roof
supported
by
pillars
,
and
defended
by
a
balustrade
.
<EOS>
The
mainentrance
was
a
handsome
piece
of
architecture
,
with
a
wide
,
round
archedgate
in
the
centre
,
and
a
lesser
entrance
at
either
side
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
ofthe
rotunda
stood
the
Earl
of
Ranelagh
's
old
mansion
,
a
structure
ofsome
magnitude
,
but
with
little
pretension
to
beauty
,
being
built
in
theformal
Dutch
taste
of
the
time
of
William
of
Orange
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
,
opposite
the
mansion
,
was
a
magnificent
conservatory
,
with
great
pots
ofaloes
in
front
.
<EOS>
In
a
line
with
the
conservatory
,
and
the
side
entranceof
the
rotunda
,
stretched
out
a
long
and
beautiful
canal
,
in
the
midstof
which
stood
a
Chinese
fishing
-
temple
,
approached
by
a
bridge
.
<EOS>
Oneither
side
of
the
canal
were
broad
gravel
walks
,
and
alleys
shaded
bylines
of
trees
,
and
separated
by
trimly
-
clipped
hedges
.
<EOS>
The
gardens
wereexquisitely
arranged
with
groves
,
bowers
,
statues
,
temples
,
wildernesses
,
and
shady
retreats
.
<EOS>
Though
Lady
Brabazon
's
carriage
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
theentrance
of
Ranelagh
when
Mr.
Cripps
and
his
party
passed
it
,
owing
tothe
crowd
and
confusion
<EOS>
it
was
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
settingdown
.
<EOS>
Before
getting
out
,
the
whole
party
put
on
their
masks
;
and
LadyBrabazon
wrapped
herself
in
a
yellow
silk
domino
.
<EOS>
Trussell
took
chargeof
Clementina
,
and
her
ladyship
fell
to
Randulph
's
care
.
<EOS>
It
was
yetextremely
early
,
but
the
crowd
was
prodigious,--many
hundred
personsbeing
assembled
in
the
area
before
the
entrance
to
the
rotunda
.
<EOS>
At
leasta
thousand
others
were
dispersed
within
the
gardens
,
for
the
rotunda
wasnot
opened
till
the
evening
;
and
it
was
afterwards
computed
that
morethan
four
thousand
persons
attended
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
At
the
entrance
,
Lady
Brabazon
and
her
daughter
were
joined
by
BeauVilliers
,
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
and
Firebras
,
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
havingdisappeared
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
already
been
more
than
once
at
Ranelagh
,
butit
was
only
to
attend
the
ordinary
concerts
,
and
never
having
seen
amasquerade
,
he
was
extraordinarily
struck
with
the
spectacle
presentedto
him
.
<EOS>
Most
of
the
characters
were
grotesquely
dressed
,
as
was
thetaste
of
the
time
,
for
it
was
not
a
period
when
the
niceties
of
costumewere
understood
or
regarded
;
still
,
the
general
effect
was
admirable
.
<EOS>
AMay
-
pole
,
surmounted
by
a
crown
,
with
long
ribands
dangling
from
it
,
wasplanted
in
front
of
the
conservatory
,
and
several
dancers
were
chasingeach
other
round
it
,
while
lively
strains
were
played
by
a
band
ofmusicians
beside
them
.
<EOS>
Other
and
less
melodious
sounds
were
heard
.
<EOS>
Now
adrummer
would
go
by
,
beating
a
rub
-
a
-
dub
enough
to
deafen
everylistener
.
<EOS>
Then
came
the
vile
scraping
of
a
fiddle
,
or
the
shrill
notesof
a
fife
.
<EOS>
The
shouts
,
the
laughter
,
the
cries
of
all
kinds
baffleddescription
,
and
equally
vain
would
it
be
to
attempt
any
delineation
ofthe
motley
assemblage
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
persons
of
all
countries
,
allperiods
,
and
all
ranks
,
for
the
most
part
oddly
enough
jumbled
together
.
<EOS>
A
pope
in
his
tiara
would
be
conversing
with
a
Jew
;
a
grave
lawyer
inhis
gown
and
wig
had
a
milk
girl
under
his
arm
;
a
highland
chief
in
hisfull
equipments
escorted
a
nun
;
a
doge
in
his
splendid
habiliments
wasjesting
with
a
common
sailor
with
a
thick
stick
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Butfrolic
and
fun
everywhere
prevailed
:
and
to
judge
from
the
noise
<EOS>
,
everybody
seemed
to
be
merry
.
<EOS>
No
one
could
escape
from
the
tricks
andjests
of
the
buffoons
with
whom
the
crowd
abounded
.
<EOS>
The
humour
of
thelast
century
was
eminently
practical
;
cuffs
and
kicks
were
liberallydealt
around
,
and
returned
in
kind
;
and
whenever
a
sounding
blow
washeard
,
it
elicited
shouts
of
laughter
like
those
that
are
heard
at
thefeigned
knocks
in
a
pantomime
.
<EOS>
The
clowns
,
Punches
,
Pierrots
,
doctors
,
and
harlequins
,
of
whom
there
were
several
,
besides
our
friend
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
,
were
the
chief
creators
in
this
kind
of
merriment
.
<EOS>
While
Randulph
,
greatly
diverted
by
all
he
saw
,
was
gazing
around
,
a
fewwords
pronounced
by
a
voice
whose
tones
thrilled
to
his
heart
caught
hisear
.
<EOS>
He
turned
,
and
saw
close
behind
him
,
attended
by
a
tall
personage
,
whose
stiffness
left
no
doubt
as
to
its
being
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
abeautiful
female
mask
,
whose
snowy
skin
,
and
dark
streaming
ringlets
,
would
have
told
him
,
if
his
heart
had
not
informed
him
of
the
fact
thatit
was
Hilda
,
but
before
he
could
summon
resolution
to
address
her
,
shehad
passed
by
;
and
Lady
Brabazon
,
who
had
likewise
heard
the
voice
andrecognised
the
speaker
,
dragged
him
in
the
opposite
direction
towardsthe
Maypole
.
<EOS>
He
looked
eagerly
backwards
,
but
the
fair
mask
was
lostamid
the
throng
,
nor
could
he
even
discern
the
tall
figure
of
SirNorfolk
.
<EOS>
A
merry
scene
was
before
him
,
but
he
heeded
it
not
.
<EOS>
The
chief
dancersround
<EOS>
the
May
-
pole
were
Mr.
Cripps
and
his
party
.
<EOS>
To
these
were
added
,
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
who
had
attached
himself
to
the
fair
Thomasine
,
tothe
no
small
annoyance
of
Peter
Pokerich
,
and
a
fat
quack
doctor
and
hisattendant
,
the
latter
having
a
fools
-
cap
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
Round
and
roundwent
the
dancers
,
Mr.
Cripps
footing
it
with
remarkable
agility
,
andPeter
vainly
emulating
his
capers
,
when
some
confusion
was
created
bySir
Singleton
attempting
to
overtake
the
fair
Thomasine
,
and
possesshimself
of
her
hand
.
<EOS>
No
more
perfect
pantaloon
can
be
imagined
than
theold
beau
represented
,
and
his
gesticulations
and
grimaces
called
forththe
laughter
of
all
the
spectators
,
which
broke
into
shouts
as
,
at
theconclusion
of
the
dance
,
Mr.
Cripps
gave
him
a
sounding
smack
on
hislean
shanks
,
with
his
wand
,
while
the
jealous
barber
lent
him
a
box
overthe
ear
.
<EOS>
But
this
did
not
quench
his
ardour
,
and
a
gesture
from
thecoquettish
columbine
,
who
seemed
determined
not
to
lose
him
,
drew
himafter
her
,
as
she
tripped
along
the
right
hand
alley
near
the
canal
withthe
rest
of
her
gamesome
party
.
<EOS>
Randulph
would
willingly
have
disengaged
himself
from
Lady
Brabazon
,
buthe
could
not
do
so
without
positive
rudeness
;
and
what
made
it
worsewas
,
that
he
was
now
left
alone
with
her
,
for
the
rest
of
the
party
haddisappeared
,
and
he
could
not
help
fearing
Beau
Villiers
might
havediscovered
Hilda
,
and
have
gone
in
pursuit
of
her
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
Randulph
<EOS>
,
"
said
her
ladyship
,
rallying
him
;
"
you
seem
to
havelost
your
spirits
at
the
very
time
they
ought
to
be
at
the
highest
.
<EOS>
Refreshments
are
given
in
the
Chinese
fishing
temple
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
there
,
and
try
whether
a
glass
of
champagne
will
enliven
you
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
suffered
himself
to
be
led
in
the
direction
mentioned
,
and
ifhe
had
been
able
to
enjoy
it
,
the
scene
offered
to
his
gaze
must
haveamused
him
,
for
it
was
extremely
lively
and
diverting
.
<EOS>
The
Chinesetemple
had
been
newly
gilt
and
decorated
,
and
its
burnished
pinnacleswere
reflected
in
the
waters
of
the
canal
.
<EOS>
It
was
filled
with
company
,
most
of
whom
were
partaking
of
refreshments
,
while
an
excellent
bandstationed
in
the
midst
of
it
played
the
liveliest
airs
,
to
which
severalparties
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
were
dancing
.
<EOS>
Amongst
others
were
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
and
his
two
columbines
,
who
frolicked
along
the
alley
on
theright
,
followed
by
the
barber
,
the
old
beau
,
and
Rathbone
,
attractinggeneral
attention
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
was
so
agile
,
danced
so
well
,
and
leapedso
wonderfully
,
that
it
was
generally
supposed
he
was
Mr.
Yates
,
thecelebrated
harlequin
of
Drury
Lane
,
while
if
the
fair
Thomasine
had
notbeen
so
pretty
,
she
would
have
been
taken
for
Mrs.
Mann
,
the
favouritecolumbine
of
the
same
house
.
<EOS>
As
it
was
,
she
was
allowed
on
all
hands
tobe
the
best
dancer
in
the
garden
;
and
her
glances
were
so
bewitching
,
that
many
other
persons
fell
in
love
with
her
besides
Sir
SingletonSpinke
.
<EOS>
One
person
,
in
especial
,
who
displayed
the
most
undisguisedadmiration
of
her
,
and
who
kept
as
near
as
he
could
,
was
a
tall
youngman
,
with
thin
,
sharp
features
,
which
Mr.
Cripps
,
after
puzzling
hisbrains
to
recollect
them
,
at
last
called
to
mind
as
belonging
to
thecompanion
of
Kitty
Conway
,
at
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
This
young
man
,
who
wore
a
long
black
silk
gown
,
a
velvet
cap
of
the
same
colour

and
aflowing
black
wig
,
and
intended
to
represent
an
Italian
doctor
,
it
isperhaps
,
almost
needless
to
say
,
was
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
Another
admirer
wasa
person
habited
as
a
pope
,
who
kept
constantly
in
their
train
,
butwhose
robe
and
large
mask
precluded
all
.
<EOS>
Neither
Mr.
Cripps
nor
his
pretty
columbine
were
displeased
by
theattention
they
attracted
,
and
the
latter
returned
the
amorous
glancescast
at
her
by
Philip
,
and
the
passionate
gestures
of
the
pope
,
in
amanner
that
drove
the
little
barber
almost
distracted
.
<EOS>
As
to
Mr.
Cripps
,
he
threw
somersets
over
the
clipped
hedge
,
vaulted
over
Mr.
Rathbone'shump
,
slapped
the
pope
on
the
back
,
clapped
the
old
beau
on
theshoulder
,
twirled
round
his
head
,
and
performed
a
hundred
otherpantomime
antics
,
to
the
infinite
diversion
of
the
beholders
.
<EOS>
Whenarrived
near
the
extremity
of
the
walk
,
he
called
out
to
the
musiciansin
the
Chinese
temple
to
strike
up
the
tune
,
"
Hey
,
boys
,
up
we
go
!
"
<EOS>
andimmediately
commenced
a
lively
dance
to
it
with
his
two
columbines
,
inwhich
<EOS>
they
were
presently
joined
by
Rathbone
,
Sir
Singleton
,
and
thebarber
.
<EOS>
Having
crossed
the
bridge
leading
to
the
Chinese
temple
,
Lady
Brabazonstopped
,
and
setting
Randulph
at
liberty
,
leaned
against
the
rail
at
theentrance
,
to
survey
the
gay
crowd
around
.
<EOS>
While
she
was
thus
engaged
,
Beau
Villiers
,
followed
by
an
attendant
with
a
bottle
of
champagne
on
asilver
waiter
,
approached
her
,
and
pressing
her
to
take
a
glass
,
lookedsignificantly
at
her
,
as
if
he
had
something
to
communicate
.
<EOS>
Taking
advantage
of
this
fortunate
interruption
,
Randulph
sprang
into
aChinese
-
fashioned
boat
lying
near
the
bridge
,
and
seizing
the
oars
,
rowed
off
towards
the
canal
,
keeping
near
its
sides
,
the
better
to
viewthe
company
.
<EOS>
Failing
,
however
,
in
discovering
the
object
of
his
search
,
he
was
returning
towards
the
bridge
,
where
Lady
Brabazon
was
stillstanding
in
conversation
with
the
beau
,
when
a
roar
of
laughter
from
thedancers
in
the
alley
on
the
farther
side
of
the
clipped
hedge
attractedhis
attention
.
<EOS>
This
,
it
appeared
,
was
occasioned
by
a
misadventure
that
had
justoccurred
to
the
old
beau
,
who
having
been
carried
away
by
his
enthusiasmat
the
fair
Thomasine
's
dancing
,
had
rushed
forward
with
the
intentionof
snatching
a
kiss
from
her
ruby
lips
,
when
the
jealous
little
barber
,
divining
his
intention
,
threw
himself
in
his
way
and
tripped
up
hisheels
.
<EOS>
In
this
posture
he
presented
a
tempting
mark
for
Mr.
Cripps
,
whose
wand
resounded
in
a
rapid
succession
of
strokes
upon
his
witheredlimbs
.
<EOS>
Randulph
,
who
had
raised
himself
in
the
boat
to
see
what
was
goingforward
,
now
sat
down
,
and
had
just
resumed
the
oars
,
when
ClementinaBrabazon
,
and
another
masked
dame
who
had
been
conversing
with
Trusselland
Firebras
,
approached
the
edge
of
the
canal
,
and
called
to
him
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
know
who
you
are
searching
for
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
cried
Clementina
;
<EOS>
"
andcould
help
you
to
find
the
person
if
I
chose
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
will
choose
,
I
am
sure
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
pulling
hastilytowards
her
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Where
is
she?""Well
,
I
'll
be
good
-
natured
,
"
she
answered
.
<EOS>
"
Look
behind
you
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
instantly
turned
in
the
direction
indicated
,
and
beheld
Hildaseated
at
one
end
of
the
temple
.
<EOS>
Behind
her
stood
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
while
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
was
handing
her
a
glass
of
champagne
.
<EOS>
But
Hildawas
so
much
occupied
by
what
was
passing
on
the
canal
,
that
she
was
notaware
of
the
knight
's
attention
.
<EOS>
As
Randulph
regarded
her
,
however
,
she
arose
,
and
declining
SirBulkeley
's
offer
,
took
Sir
Norfolk
's
arm
,
and
left
the
temple
.
<EOS>
Heedlessof
Clementina
's
laughter
,
Randulph
,
without
losing
sight
of
Hilda
,
pushed
the
boat
towards
the
bank
,
and
leaping
out
,
was
about
to
followher
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
a
heavy
hand
laid
on
his
arm
,
and
lookingup
,
he
beheld
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"You
are
on
a
vain
quest
,
young
man
,
"
said
Firebras
,
in
an
undertone
.
<EOS>
"You
will
never
obtain
a
word
with
Hilda
Scarve
unless
by
my
mediation
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
made
a
movement
of
impatience
.
<EOS>
"
Be
not
rash
,
"
pursued
Firebras
,
still
detaining
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
tell
you
,
you
will
totally
fail
in
your
object
,
and
will
only
involve
yourself
in
a
quarrel
with
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
.
<EOS>
""I
care
not
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
Let
me
go
.
<EOS>
By
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
shall
loseher
.
<EOS>
""That
<EOS>
you
most
assuredly
will
,
if
you
follow
her
now
,
"
rejoined
Firebrascalmly
.
"
<EOS>
Be
ruled
by
me
.
<EOS>
I
will
introduce
you
to
her
,
but
it
can
not
bein
your
own
character
,
for
Sir
Norfolk
has
been
requested
by
her
fathernot
to
permit
your
approach
.
<EOS>
And
I
shall
,
therefore
,
have
to
pass
youoff
to
him
as
someone
else
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
attach
no
condition
to
the
obligation
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Randulph,--"noneat
least
that
I
can
not
honourably
comply
with
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
may
,
perhaps
,
remind
you
of
it
at
some
future
time
,
that
is
all,"rejoined
Firebras
.
"Enough
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
Take
me
to
her
at
once
.
""Impossible
!
"
exclaimed
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
I
must
prepare
Sir
Norfolk
,
and
giveHilda
a
hint
of
my
intention
,
lest
she
should
prevent
it
,
for
Iperceived
just
now
that
she
discovered
you
.
<EOS>
Rejoin
your
party
,
and
avoidexciting
the
suspicions
of
Lady
Brabazon
and
Beau
Villiers
,
or
they
maymar
all
.
<EOS>
I
may
not
,
perhaps
,
be
able
to
accomplish
the
object
you
desiretill
the
evening
,
so
curb
your
impatience
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
moved
off
,
and
mingled
with
the
crowd
,
while
Randulphjoined
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
made
many
sarcastic
remarks
upon
hisdisplay
upon
the
water
,
and
complimented
him
,
ironically
,
upon
his
skillas
a
rower
.
<EOS>
Randulph
was
in
no
mood
for
such
raillery
,
and
might
havemade
some
angry
retort
,
but
at
that
moment
,
there
was
a
great
stir
inthe
walk
near
the
bridge
,
occasioned
by
the
approach
of
the
Prince
andPrincess
of
Wales
,
attended
by
a
large
retinue
.
<EOS>
The
royal
party
enteredthe
temple
,
and
remained
there
more
than
half
an
hour
conversing
withthose
around
them
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
the
honour
of
a
presentation
to
theprince
,
by
Mr.
Villiers
;
and
while
engaged
in
conversation
with
thatillustrious
personage
,
he
perceived
Cordwell
Firebras
among
theby
-
standers
;
but
he
could
not
,
without
a
breach
of
etiquette
,
withdrawto
speak
to
him
,
and
when
the
royal
party
quitted
the
temple
,
he
wasgone
.
<EOS>
He
was
about
to
search
for
him
,
when
Beau
Villiers
,
who
hadfollowed
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
hastily
returned
,
and
said
,
with
anexpression
of
malicious
satisfaction
that
he
had
his
Royal
Highness'scommands
to
him
to
join
his
train
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
no
alternative
butcompliance
,
and
to
his
own
chagrin
,
and
his
uncle
Trussell
's
delight
,
hemingled
with
the
royal
attendants
,
and
proceeded
with
them
in
theirpromenade
through
the
gardens
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
ramble
,
he
perceived
Firebras
standing
with
Hildaand
Sir
Norfolk
;
and
though
he
was
greatly
annoyed
not
to
be
able
tojoin
them
,
it
was
some
satisfaction
to
him
to
observe
that
his
presentposition
seemed
to
operate
to
his
advantage
with
the
lady
.
<EOS>
Theperformances
of
Mr.
Cripps
's
party
diverted
both
the
royal
personagesduring
their
stroll
,
and
they
laughed
heartily
at
a
comic
dance
executedby
them
.
<EOS>
Some
hours
passed
on
in
this
way
,
and
Randulph
was
still
held
inbondage
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
rotunda
was
opened
.
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
royal
partywas
ceremoniously
ushered
in
,
in
the
first
place
;
but
immediatelyafterwards
,
crowds
poured
in
,
and
the
whole
area
of
the
amphitheatre
,
together
with
the
boxes
,
and
gallery
above
,
were
filled
with
company
.
<EOS>
What
with
the
innumerable
lights
,
and
the
extraordinary
variety
ofdresses
,
the
whole
scene
had
a
most
brilliant
effect
.
<EOS>
There
was
anexcellent
band
in
the
orchestra
,
and
a
concert
was
commenced
,
but
littleattention
was
paid
to
it
by
the
assemblage
,
who
continued
promenadinground
and
round
the
amphitheatre
--
laughing
and
talking
loudly
with
eachother
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
concert
was
over
,
the
loud
blowing
of
a
hornattracted
general
observation
to
a
platform
near
the
central
column
,
onwhich
<EOS>
the
quack
doctor
and
his
attendant
were
stationed
--
the
latter
ofwhom
began
dispensing
his
medicines
,
and
vaunting
their
efficacy
,
in
ahighly
ludicrous
manner
.
<EOS>
This
and
other
entertainments
consumed
the
time
till
ten
o'clock
;
beforewhich
,
however
,
a
magnificent
supper
was
served
to
the
royal
party
in
aprivate
refreshment
room
.
<EOS>
A
bell
was
then
rung
,
to
announce
that
a
granddisplay
of
fireworks
was
about
to
take
place
,
and
the
company
hurried
tothe
outer
galleries
and
to
the
gardens
to
witness
the
exhibition
.
<EOS>
Muchconfusion
ensued
,
and
amidst
it
,
the
fair
Thomasine
,
somehow
or
other
,
got
separated
from
her
party
.
<EOS>
The
little
barber
was
almost
frantic
.
<EOS>
He
rushed
hither
and
thither
amongthe
crowd
,
calling
for
her
by
name
,
and
exciting
general
ridicule
.
<EOS>
Atlast
,
in
an
agony
of
despair
,
he
stationed
himself
near
the
scaffoldwhere
the
fireworks
were
placed
;
and
when
the
first
signal
-
rocketascended
,
he
perceived
her
pretty
face
turned
upwards
at
a
littledistance
from
him
.
<EOS>
She
was
standing
near
the
trees
with
the
old
beau
,
whose
transports
at
his
enviable
situation
were
somewhat
disturbed
bythe
descent
of
the
heavy
rocket
-
stick
on
his
head
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
thelittle
barber
reached
his
truant
mistress
,
and
forcing
her
from
SirSingleton
,
placed
her
rounded
arm
under
his
own
,
and
held
it
fast
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
dear
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
"
said
the
naughty
little
Thomasine
,
for
'
fair
'
she
does
not
deserve
to
be
called
;
"
we
've
been
looking
foryou
<EOS>
everywhere,"--(here
<EOS>
she
told
a
sad
story.)--"That
odious
old
fellowhas
been
trying
to
persuade
me
to
run
away
with
him
.
<EOS>
He
offers
tosettle
--
I
do
n't
know
what
--
upon
me
,
and
to
make
me
Lady
Singleton
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
why
do
n't
you
accept
his
offer
?
"
said
the
barber
,
in
an
ecstasy
ofjealous
rage
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
'm
engaged
,
and
engagements
with
me
are
sacred
things,"replied
<EOS>
the
fair
Thomasine
,
theatrically
,
yet
tenderly
.
<EOS>
"
But
do
look
atthat
beautiful
wheel!"The
fireworks
were
really
splendid

scattering

concluded
the

,
amid

<EOS>
Darkness
for
a
few
minutes
enveloped
the
crowd
,
during
which
a
few
crieswere
heard
in
timid
female
tones
,
but
the
lamps
were
as
soon
as

,
and
the
majority
of
the
assemblage
returned
to
the
rotunda

they
repaired
to
the
alcoves

many
a

quaffed

<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone
gave
a

to
his
party
,
in
which
the
old
beau
contrived
to
get
himselfincluded
.
<EOS>
He
contrived
also
to
sit
next
the
fair
Thomasine
,
and
pledgedher
so
often
and
so
deeply
that
he
fell
beneath
the
table

<EOS>
Here
he
wasleft
by

others

and
a
minuet
being
struck
up
,
Mr.
Cripps
offered
hishand
to
the
widow
,
and
led
her
forth
to
dance
,
while
Mr.
Rathbone
,
greatly
exhilarated
by
the
punch
he
had
drunk
,
stood
by
laughing
at
themready
to
split
his
sides
,
and
the
little
barber
took
the
opportunity
oftheir
being
left
alone
together
,
to
reprove
the
fair
Thomasine
for
herimproper
conduct
towards
the
old
beau

<EOS>
Liberated
by
the
departure
of
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
who
quitted

on
the
conclusion
of
the
fireworks
,
Randulph
immediatelyreturned
to
the
rotunda

in
the
hope

finding
Hilda
still
there

<EOS>
Hehad
scarcely
entered
it
when
he
perceived
Firebras
at
supper
by

one
of
the
alcoves

and
instantly
joined
him
.
<EOS>
"She

"
and
as
soon

There

"Randulph
declined
the
latter
offer

and
was
obliged
to
control
hisimpatience
until
Firebras
thought
fit
to
rise
.
<EOS>
Crossing
theamphitheatre

they
proceeded
to
an
alcove
,
in
which
Sir

andHilda
were
seated
,
and
Firebras
,
bowing
to
the
old
knight

.
<EOS>
"Upon
<EOS>
this
Hilda
arose
,
and
tendered
her
hand
,
with
some
trepidation
,
toRandulph
,
who
,
with
a
breast
thrilling
with
joyful
emotion
,
led
her
intothe
open
space
cleared
for
the
dancers
,
and
part
of
which
was
alreadyoccupied
,
as
before
related
,
by
Mr.
Cripps
and
the
widow
.
<EOS>
No
time
wasallowed
Randulph
to
hazard
a
word
to
his
partner
.
<EOS>
Scarcely
were
theyplaced
,
when
the
minuet
commenced
.
<EOS>
The
grace
with
which
they
executedthis
charming
,
though
formal
dance
,
excited
the
admiration
of
all
thebeholders
,
and
contrasted
strongly
with
the
exaggerated
style
in
whichit
was
executed
by
Mr.
Cripps
and
Mrs.
Nettleship
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
a
betterfoil
--
had
such
been
desired
--
could
not
have
been
found
than
the
twolatter
personages
presented
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
planted
himself
on
one
side
toview
the
dance
,
and
there
was
unwonted
elation
in
his
countenance
as
hewitnessed
the
graceful
movements
of
his
fair
cousin
and
her
partner
.
<EOS>
Trussell
in
his
Turkish
dress
was
among
the
spectators
;
and
not
far
fromhim
stood
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
There
were
two
other
personages
,
also
,
whowatched
the
dance
,
but
who
regarded
it
with
any
other
sentiments
thanthose
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
These
were
Lady
Brabazon
and
Beau
Villiers
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
you
see
,
Villiers
,
notwithstanding
all
your
scheming
,
he
hascontrived
to
dance
with
her
,
"
said
the
former
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
has
,
"
replied
the
beau
,
partly
removing
his
mask
,
and
displaying
acountenance
inflamed
with
<EOS>
passion--"but
<EOS>
he
has
not
exchanged
a
word
withher
,
and
I
will
take
care
<EOS>
he
shall
not
exchange
one
.
<EOS>
""You
are
desperately
in
love
with
this
girl
,
Villiers
,
"
said
LadyBrabazon
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
it
was
her
fortune
merely
you
aimed
at
.
<EOS>
""I
have
been
foiled
,
and
that
has
piqued
me
,
"
replied
Villiers
.
<EOS>
"Le
<EOS>
jeu
<EOS>
ne
vaut
pas
la
chandelle
,
"
rejoined
Lady
Brabazon
.
"
<EOS>
After
thefailure
of
your
attempt
to
carry
her
off
,
I
wonder
you
will
persevere
.
<EOS>
""Hush
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
beau
.
<EOS>
"
Someone
may
overhear
us
.
<EOS>
I
would
havecarried
her
off
to
-
night
,
if
I
had
known
she
would
have
been
here
.
<EOS>
Yourladyship
ought
to
be
obliged
to
me
for
the
trouble
I
am
taking
.
<EOS>
I
shallremove
your
rival
,
and
you
will
then
have
young
Crew
entirely
toyourself
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
put
Sir
Norfolk
on
his
guard
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
passed
on
to
the
Welsh
baronet
,
and
addressed
him
.
<EOS>
Thelatter
bowed
stiffly
in
return
,
and
approached
nearer
the
dancers
;
andwhile
Hilda
was
curtseying
to
her
partner
at
the
close
of
the
minuet
,
hetook
her
hand
and
led
her
away
.
<EOS>
The
young
man
would
have
followed
them
,
but
Cordwell
Firebras
came
up
and
arrested
him
.
<EOS>
"It
wo
nt
do
,
"
he
said
;
"
Villiers
has
told
the
old
baronet
who
you
are
.
<EOS>
Imust
go
after
him
instantly
,
and
make
some
excuse
for
my
share
in
thematter
,
or
I
shall
have
to
cross
swords
with
him
to
-
morrow
morning
.
<EOS>
Ihave
done
all
I
can
for
you
.
<EOS>
Good
night
.
<EOS>
"Soon
<EOS>
after
this
,
Randulph
quitted
the
masquerade
with
Trussell
.
<EOS>
Withsome
difficulty
a
boat
was
procured
to
convey
them
home
.
<EOS>
Finding
hisnephew
in
no
mood
for
conversation
,
Trussell
,
who
was
rather
tired
,
andmoreover
had
drunk
a
good
deal
of
punch
and
champagne
,
disposed
himselfto
slumber
,
nor
did
he
wake
till
they
reached
Lambeth
stairs
.
<EOS>
Anotherboat
had
just
landed
,
and
two
persons
in
dominos
marched
before
them
inthe
very
direction
they
were
going
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
who
have
we
here
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Trussell
,
running
forward
to
overtakethem
.
"
<EOS>
Zounds
!
<EOS>
brother
,
is
it
you
?
<EOS>
Have
you
been
at
the
masquerade?""I
have

replied
Abel

"
and
I
have
seen
all
that

A
PIECE
OF
INTELLIGENCE
TO
RANDULPH
--
TRUSSELL
AND

TO
DRURY

LANE."About
a
week
after
this
,
as
Randulph
was
dressing
himself
one
morning
<EOS>
,
Mr
.
Jukes
entered
his
room
,
and
informed
him
that
the
miser
's
servant
,
Jacob
Post
,
wished
to
speak
to
him
.
<EOS>
"He
's
at
the
door
,
"
added
the
butler
,
mysteriously--"he
seems
veryanxious
to
see
you
,
so
I
brought
him
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
""Quite
<EOS>
right
,
Jukes
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Randulph--"let
<EOS>
him
come
in
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
know
that
it
is
quite
right
,
sir
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
my
master
may
be
angry
with
me
for
admitting
him
;
but
I
didn'tlike
to
disoblige
you
.
<EOS>
""Very
<EOS>
kind
of
you
indeed
,
Jukes
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
My
uncle
shall
knownothing
about
the
matter
from
me
.
<EOS>
But
let
Jacob
come
in
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
good
-
natured
butler
then
retired
,
and
the
next
moment
the
porterentered
the
room
,
scratching
his
head
,
as
was
his
wo
nt
when
in
any
wayembarrassed
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
Jacob
,
"
said
Randulph
,
extending
his
hand
to
him,--"I'm
glad
tosee
you
.
<EOS>
Sit
down
.
<EOS>
""No
,
I
thank'ee
,
sir

"
replied
Jacob
,
"
I
'd
rather
stand
.
<EOS>
My
businesswon't
allow
of
sittin
.
<EOS>
""Then
begin
upon
it
at
once
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Before
<EOS>
I
begin
,
"
said
Jacob
,
making
himself
up
for
a
speech
,
"
I
mustpremise
that
I
'm
come
on
my
own
accord
,
and
at
nobody
else
's
requestwhatsomdever
,
least
of
all
by
desire
of
Miss
Hilda--""I'm
perfectly
satisfied
of
it

Jacob

interruptedRandulph--"perfectly

<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
quite
understand
I
'm
come
here
without
her
knowledge
orprevitty
?
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"Quite
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Randulph--"I
am
quite
sure
she
did
not
send
you
.
<EOS>
""No
,
that
she
did
n't
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
"
and
mortal
angry
she
'd
be
withme
if
she
thought
I
had
come
.
<EOS>
But
I
see
you
're
impatient
,
and
I
'll
keepyou
no
longer
in
suspense
.
<EOS>
I
'm
come
,
then
,
to
tell
you
,
that
my
youngmissis
is
going
to
Wauxhall
to

night
.
<EOS>
""A
thousand
thanks
for
the
information
,
Jacob
,
"
cried
Randulph
,
taking
acrown
from
his
purse
which
lay
on
the
table--"Drink
my
health
.
<EOS>
""I'd
<EOS>
rather
not
take
the
money,--much
obliged
to
you
all
the
same
,
sir,"replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
as
I
was
sayin
'
,
my
missis
is
goin'
to
Wauxhall
withSir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
and
they
're
to
join
Lady
Drabbyson
and
Mr
.
Willars
.
<EOS>
Now
I
've
no
great
opinion
of
those
two
fine
folks
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Isuspect
they
're
contriving
some
wicked
design
against
Miss
Hilda
.
<EOS>
Butit
's
no
use
warnin
'
<EOS>
my
master
,
for
he
wilfully
shuts
his
eyes
to
danger;and
as
to
Sir
Norfolk
,
he
's
too
much
wrapped
up
in
himself
,
and
tooproud
to
listen
to
me
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
thought
it
better
to
come
to
you
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
do
you
suspect
,
Jacob
?
"
asked
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
it
's
no
matter
what
I
suspect
just
now
,
"
replied
the
porter--"butI'm
on
a
scent
,
and
I
'll
find
it
out
before
night
.
<EOS>
Have
you
heard
o
'
theattempt
to
carry
off
my
young
missis?""No
,
"
replied
<EOS>
Randulph--"but
<EOS>
you
do
n't
surely
suspect
Mr.
Villiers
<EOS>
ofit?""It
may
n't
be
safe
to
speak
out
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
"
especially
as
I
can'tbring
proof
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
almost
undertake
to
swear
that
his
walet
,
Mr
.
Cripps
,
was
one
of
the
parties
engaged
in
it
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
rascal
is
capable
of
anything
,
"
cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
Satisfy
me
thatMr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
was
the
author
of
the
atrocious
attempt
you
have
mentioned
,
and
he
shall
pay
for
his
villainy
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
""Wait
<EOS>
till
to
-
night
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
be
able
to
satisfy
youthen
.
<EOS>
I
'm
on
the
look
out
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
my
own
reasons
for
thinking
some
design
is
on
foot
,
"
repliedRandulph
,
"
because
Lady
Brabazon
has
sent
me
and
my
uncle
tickets
forDrury
Lane
to
-
night
,
regretting
she
could
not
go
there
herself
,
butomitting
to
mention
a
word
about
Vauxhall
.
<EOS>
""She
wanted
to
get
you
out
<EOS>
o

<EOS>
the
way
,
"
returned
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
It
's
adeep
-
laid
scheme
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
unravel
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
let
any
one,--not
even
youruncle
,
Mr.
Trussell
--
<EOS>
know
you
're
goin'
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
can
watch
what'sdone
,
and
act
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
there
,
and
let
you
know
what
I'velearnt
in
the
meantime
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
entirely
approve
of
your
advice
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
,
"
and
will
act
inaccordance
with
it
.
<EOS>
But
how
will
you
see
me
there?""Be
under
the
orchyster
at
ten
o'clock
,
and
I
'll
find
means
o
'
comin
'
toyou
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
my
time
's
up
.
<EOS>
You
'll
be
cautious
.
<EOS>
""Fear
me
not
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
And
Jacob
took
his
departure
.
<EOS>
Acting
upon
the
porter
's
suggestion
,
Randulph
said
nothing
to
his
unclesof
what
had
passed
;
nor
did
Mr.
Jukes
mention
a
word
of
Jacob
's
visit
,
so
that
neither
of
them
had
any
idea
of
the
cause
of
his
abstraction
,
though
they
both
remarked
it
.
<EOS>
He
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
morningin
his
own
room
,
in
order
to
indulge
his
thoughts
unrestrainedly
,
andonly
came
down
stairs
to
dinner
,
when
he
was
perfectly
composed
.
<EOS>
Abelwas
graver
than
usual
,
but
Trussell
was
in
his
usual
flow
of
spirits
,
and
talked
of
the
performances
they
were
about
to
witness
.
<EOS>
"We
are
going
to
see
the
Beau
's
Stratagem
,
sir
,
"
he
said
to
his
brother,"and
as
Mr.
Garrick
is
to
play
Archer
,
and
<EOS>
Mr.
Macklin
,
Scrub
,
we
cannotfail
of
being
well
entertained
.
<EOS>
""Humph
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
as
to
ladies
,
"
added
Trussell
,
turning
to
Randulph
,
"
we
are
tohave
the
charming
Mrs.
Cibber
,
and
the
scarcely
-
less
charming
Mrs

critics
tell
me
that
the
new

Temple

<EOS>
""No

wonder

say
so

observed
Abel
with
a
sneer
,
"
the
very
title
issure
to
make
it
attractive
to
them
.
<EOS>
""Bravo
!
"
exclaimed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
By
-
the
-
bye

"
he
added
,
aside
to
Randulph,"your
friend
Kitty
Conway

""Indeed
!
"
exclaimed
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
surprised
you
do
n't
go
to
hear
her
,
"
said
Abel
,
who
had
overheardthe
remark
,
looking
so
hard
at
him
that
he
was
covered
with
confusion
.
<EOS>
"He
's
otherwise
engaged
,
"
interrupted
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
heard
of
it
thismorning
by
accident

<EOS>
We
'll
go

<EOS>
""No

do
n't
alter

cried
Randulph
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Singleton
Spinke
will
be
there
,
I
'll
be
sworn

laughedTrussell--"though
he
's
got
a
new
flame
;
the
daughter
of
a
mercer
namedDeacle
,
who
lives
in
the
Little
Sanctuary
just
opposite
;
but
never
mindwhere
she
lives

"
he
added
,
observing
his
brother
frown--"she
's
adevilish
pretty
girl
,
and
is
called

on
account
of
her
beauty

the
fairThomasine

<EOS>
You
saw
her
at
the
masquerade
at
Ranelagh
the
other
night
.
<EOS>
She
was
one
of
the
columbines
with
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
""I
noticed
her
,
"
observed
Abel--"a
<EOS>
silly
coquette!""I'll
tell
you
a
capital
joke
about
Sir
Singleton
and
this
fair
damsel,"pursued
<EOS>
Trussell
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
You
must
know
that
he
supped
with
her
andher
party
the
other
night
at
Ranelagh
,
and
got
so
drunk
that
he
was
leftunder
the
table
in
the
box
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
in
this
state
,
some
one
,
mostprobably
Mr.
Cripps
,
cut
off
his
long
queue
,
and
sent
it
the
nextmorning
in
a
packet
to
the
fair
Thomasine
,
accompanied
by
a
tenderepistle
,
offering
her
his
hand
,
and
begging
,
as
he
could
not
send
her
alock
of
his
hair
,
to
enclose
instead
,
his
pigtail!""Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!"--laughed
<EOS>
Mr.
Jukes
,
who
was
in
attendance
.
<EOS>
"
Just
like
oneof
Crackenthorpe
's
tricks,--just
like
him
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
story
forced
a
smile
even
from
Abel
,
and
the
rest
of
the
dinnerpassed
off
agreeably
enough
.
<EOS>
The
cloth
was
removed
,
and
the
wine
placedupon
the
table
,
but
Randulph
scarcely
tasted
it
,
and
Trussell
,
afterswallowing
a
few
glasses
,
<EOS>
said
it
was
time
to
start
for
the
play
.
<EOS>
"Before

you
go
,
I
have
a
word
to
say
to
you

Randulph

remarked
Abel
,
in
a
tone
that
alarmed
the
young
man
:
<EOS>
"
I
have
made
no
comments
upon

at
a
loss
to
know
what
particular
part
of
my
conduct
hasdispleased
you
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
speak
of
your
conduct
generally
,
not
particularly
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
severely
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
there
will
be
one
here
<EOS>
to
-
morrow
who
has
a
better
titleto
admonish
you
than
I
have
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
can
not
mean
my
mother
,
sir
,
"
said
Randulph
,
in
great
surprise
.
<EOS>
"
Isshe
coming
to
town?""She
will
be
here
to
-
morrow
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
are
detaining
youruncle
Trussell
--
he
is
impatient
.
<EOS>
Go
.
<EOS>
It
is
your
last
night
.
<EOS>
Make
themost
of
it
.
<EOS>
"Trussell
<EOS>
was
as
much
surprised
as
Randulph
at
what
had
just
passed
<EOS>
,
buthe
made
no
remark
till
they
got
out
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
shall
be
delighted
to
see
my
sister
Crew
,
<EOS>
"
he
said--"delightedto
see
her
.
<EOS>
But
I
wonder
why
the
old
gentleman
made
a
secret
of
hercoming
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
be
apprehensive
of
any
lectures
from
her
,
Randulph
.
<EOS>
I'llset
all
right
,
depend
upon
it
.
<EOS>
""It
is
strange
<EOS>
she
should
n't
have
written
to
me
on
the
subject
,
"
saidRandulph
.
<EOS>
"Most
<EOS>
likely
my
brother
imposed
secrecy
on
her
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"However
<EOS>
,
we
must
have
a
little
talk
together
before
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
I
musttell
you
how
to
act
at
this
juncture
.
<EOS>
She
's
an
excellent
creature
,
yourmother
.
<EOS>
But
it
'll
never
do
to
be
tied
to
the
apron
string
.
<EOS>
Let
us
forgetthe
matter
now
,
and
taking
the
old
gentleman
's
advice
,
make
the
most
oftonight
.
<EOS>
"A
boat
conveyed
them
to
Somerset
Stairs
,
where
they
landed
,
andproceeded
to
Drury
-
lane
Theatre
.
<EOS>
Randulph
had
resolved
upon
what
courseto
pursue
.
<EOS>
The
play
was
admirably
performed
;
but
even
the
inimitableacting
of
Garrick
and
Macklin
failed
to
interest
Randulph
,
so
much
washe
pre
-
occupied
.
<EOS>
The
comedy
over
,
they
adjourned
to

Covent

,
where
abundance
of
company
was
assembled
,
plentifullybesprinkled
with

<EOS>
Trussell
met
a
hostof
acquaintances
,
and
framing
a
hasty
excuse
,
Randulph
left
him
withthem
,

hurrying
to

CHAPTER
X.--THE
SUPPER
AT
VAUXHALL
--
<EOS>
BEAU
VILLIERS
'
ATTEMPT
TO
CARRY
OFF
HILDADEFEATED
BY
RANDULPH.Celebrated
throughout
Europe
,
and
once
esteemed
the
most
delightfulplace
of
recreation
of
the
kind
,
Vauxhall
Gardens
have
been
in
existencefor
more
than
a
century
;
and
it
rejoices
us
to
find
that
they
are
notaltogether
closed
.
<EOS>
They
were
first
opened
with
a
ridotto
al
fresco
,
about
the
year
1730
,
and
speedily
rising
to
a
high
reputation
,
wereenlarged
and
laid
out
in
the
most
superb
manner
.
<EOS>
A
magnificentorchestra
,
of
Gothic
form
,
ornamented
with
carvings
and
niches
,
andprovided
with
a
fine
organ
,
was
erected
in
the
midst
of
the
garden
.
<EOS>
There
was
likewise
a
rotunda
,
though
not
of
equal
dimensions
with
thatof
Ranelagh
,
being
only
seventy
feet
in
diameter
,
with
a
dome
-
like
roof
,
supported
by
four
Ionic
columns
,
embellished
with
foliage
at
the
base
,
while
the
shafts
were
wreathed
with
a
Gothic
balustrade
,
representingclimbing
figures
.
<EOS>
From
the
centre
depended
a
magnificent
chandelier
.
<EOS>
Apart
of
the
rotunda
,
used
as
a
saloon
was
decorated
with
columns
,
between
which
were
paintings
by
Hayman
.
<EOS>
The
entrance
from
the
gardenswas
through
a
Gothic
portal
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
there
were
pavilions
or
alcoves
,
ornamented
with
paintings
from
designs
by
Hogarth
and
Hayman
,
appropriate
to
the
place
;
each
alcove
having
a
table
in
it
capable
ofaccommodating
six
or
eight
persons
,
and
leading
in
an
extensive
sweep
toan
extensive
piazza
,
five
hundred
feet
in
length
,
of
Chinesearchitecture
.
<EOS>
This
semicircle
led
to
a
further
sweep
of
pavilions
.
<EOS>
Anoble
gravel
walk
,
nine
hundred
feet
in
length
,
bordered
with
loftytrees
,
and
terminated
by
a
broad
lawn
,
in
which
there
was
a
Gothicobelisk
,
faced
the
entrance
.
<EOS>
But
the
enchantment
of
the
gardenscommenced
with
the
moment
of
their
illumination
,
when
upwards
of
twothousand
lamps
lighted
almost
simultaneously
,
glimmered
through
thegreen
leaves
of
the
trees
,
and
shed
their
radiance
on
the
fairy
scenearound
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
grand
charm
of
Vauxhall
.
<EOS>
One
of
its
minorattractions
was
a
curious
piece
of
machinery
,
representing
a
miller'shouse
,
a
water
-
wheel
,
and
a
cascade
,
which
at
that
period
of
the
art
wasthought
quite
marvellous
.
<EOS>
There
were
numberless
walks
and
wildernessesin
the
grounds
,
and
most
of
the
vistas
were
adorned
with
statues
.
<EOS>
In
oneof
them
,
at
a
date
a
little
posterior
to
this
history
,
was
a
statue
ofHandel
as
Orpheus
,
holding
a
lyre
.
<EOS>
It
was
nearly
ten
o'clock
when
Randulph
reached
the
gardens
.
<EOS>
Heproceeded
along
the
grand
walk
,
which
was
brilliantly
illuminated
andfilled
with
company
,
as
far
as
the
obelisk
,
but
he
could
see
nothing
ofSir
Norfolk
or
Hilda
.
<EOS>
He
turned
into
one
of
the
side
walks
,
andapproached
the
orchestra
,
in
front
of
which
stood
Kitty
Conway
,
preparing
to
sing
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
detected
him
,
and
made
a
slightmovement
of
recognition
.
<EOS>
As
he
passed
a
range
of
alcoves
beneath
theorchestra
,
he
perceived
Jacob
,
who
instantly
came
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"I've
found
it
all
out
,
"
said
the
porter--"I
knew
I
should
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Willarsis
the
contriver
of
the
plot
.
<EOS>
He
means
to
carry
Miss
Hilda
off
,
and
hasengaged
a
coach
for
that
purpose
,
which
is
stationed
at
the
back
o
'
thegardens
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
the
coachman
is
a
friend
o
'
mine
,
and
it
's
through
himI've
detected
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
where
is
your
mistress
?
"
cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"There
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
pointing
to
a
party
seated
at
supper
beneath
thegrove
of
trees
in
front
of
the
orchestra
.
<EOS>
"I
see
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
By
heaven
!
"
he
cried
,
"
Mr.
Villiers
iscoming
this
way
.
<EOS>
Two
persons
stop
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
live
,
one
of
them
is
hisvalet
,
and
the
other
Captain
Culpepper
,
a
fellow
whom
my
uncle
<EOS>
Trusselltold
me
was
a
sort
of
bravo
,
and
would
cut
any
man
's
throat
for
hire
.
<EOS>
Doubtless
,
they
're
planning
the
abduction
.
<EOS>
""You
may
take
your
oath
of
it
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
manage
to
get
near'em
unobserved
.
<EOS>
Come
back
to
this
place
when
they
separate
,
and
youshall
know
all
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
slouched
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
mingling
with
thecrowd
,
got
within
earshot
of
the
beau
,
who
,
as
has
been
intimated
,
wasaddressing
Captain
Culpepper
and
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
Randulph
,
meanwhile
,
felt
irresistibly
drawn
towards
the
table
whereHilda
was
seated
,
and
as
he
kept
behind
the
trees
,
he
was
not
noticed
bythe
party
,
though
he
was
noticed
by
Kitty
Conway
,
from
the
orchestra
,
who
,
guessing
his
intention
,
was
so
much
agitated
that
for
the
firsttime
in
her
professional
career
,
she
made
some
false
notes
in
hersinging
.
<EOS>
Hilda
's
seat
was
placed
against
a
tree
.
<EOS>
On
her
right
was
SirNorfolk
Salusbury
;
and
on
the
right
of
the
baronet
,
Lady
Brabazon
;
nextto
her
ladyship
was
a
vacant
chair
--
no
doubt
just
quitted
by
BeauVilliers
;
then
came
Lady
Fazakerly
;
then
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
;
and
,
lastly
,
Clementina
Brabazon
,
who
occupied
the
seat
on
the
left
of
themiser
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
Partly
screened
by
the
tree
against
which
Hilda
wasseated
,
Randulph
bent
forward
,
and
breathed
her
name
in
the
gentlestaccents
.
<EOS>
Hilda
heard
the
whisper
,
and
looking
round
,
beheld
the
speaker
.
<EOS>
How
much
may
he
conveyed
in
a
glance
!
<EOS>
She
read
the
intensity
of
hispassion
,
and
the
depth
of
his
devotion
in
his
eyes
;
and
for
the
firsttime
,
returned
his
gaze
with
a
look
of
kindness
,
almost
of
tenderness
.
<EOS>
Randulph
was
transported
;
he
could
not
resist
the
impulse
that
promptedhim
to
advance
,
and
take
her
hand
,
which
she
unresistingly
yielded
tohim
.
<EOS>
All
this
was
the
work
of
a
minute
,
but
the
action
had
not
beenunobserved
,
either
by
Kitty
Conway
or
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
Both
had
felt
asimilar
pang
of
jealousy
,
but
revenge
instantly
occurred
to
the
latter
.
<EOS>
While
Randulph
was
in
the
act
of
raising
Hilda
's
hand
to
his
lips
,
shetouched
Sir
Norfolk
's
arm
,
and
pointing
in
the
direction
of
the
lovers
,
whispered
,
"
<EOS>
Look
there!"Sir
Norfolk
arose
,
and
in
a
stern
and
peremptory
voice
,
said
to
theyoung
man
,
"
Set
free
that
lady
's
hand
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
unless
she
chooses
to
withdraw
it
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
am
wholly
to
blame
for
this
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
said
Hilda
,
withdrawingher
hand
,
and
blushing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"You
are
pleased
to
say
so
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
returned
Sir
Norfolk
;
"
but
theyoung
man
has
been
guilty
of
a
great
indecorum
,
and
I
shall
call
him
toa
strict
account
for
it
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
be
ready
to
answer
the
call
,
whenever
you
please
,
Sir
Norfolk,"rejoined
Randulph
;
"
but
this
is
not
the
place
for
menaces
.
<EOS>
You
will
dowell
to
look
after
your
charge
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
take
care
to
keep
off
impertinents
like
you
,
"
replied
SirNorfolk
.
<EOS>
"Better
<EOS>
guard
her
against
other
dangers
,
which
require
more
penetrationthan
you
care
to
practise
,
"
retorted
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
have
only
one
answer
to
make
to
such
insolence
,
"
said
Sir
Norfolk,"and
that
shall
be
given
to
-
morrow
.
<EOS>
You
shall
hear
from
me
,
Mr.
Crew
.
<EOS>
""As
soon
as
you
please
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"For
<EOS>
my
sake
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
interposed
Hilda
,
"
let
this
quarrel
go
nofurther
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
the
innocent
cause
of
it
.
<EOS>
Promise
me
it
shall
not
.
<EOS>
""I
would
willingly
obey
you
in
anything
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
replied
Randulph;"but
in
this
case
,
it
is
not
in
my
power
.
<EOS>
Farewell!"Fixing
one
passionate
look
upon
her
,
he
then
bowed
haughtily
to
SirNorfolk
,
who
returned
his
salutation
in
kind
,
and
withdrew
.
<EOS>
As
he
walked
away
,
he
encountered
Beau
Villiers
,
who
was
returning
fromhis
conference
.
<EOS>
Villiers
started
on
seeing
him
,
but
instantly
recoveredhimself
,
and
would
have
addressed
him
,
but
Randulph
turned
abruptlyaway
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
the
devil
has
brought
Randulph
Crew
here
?
"
said
Villiers
to
SirSingleton
,
as
he
joined
the
party
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
he
was
at
Drury
Lane
.
<EOS>
""Devil
knows
!
"
cried
the
old
beau
.
"
<EOS>
But
he
has
made
a
pretty
scene
.
<EOS>
"
Andhe
proceeded
to
relate
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
Villiers
laughed
heartily
atthe
recital
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
old
Salusbury
will
cut
his
throat
,
"
he
said
,
in
an
undertone
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
it
would
be
desirable
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
,
certainly,"replied
<EOS>
the
old
beau
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
women
are
all
mad
about
him
.
<EOS>
""Especially
<EOS>
Kitty
Conway
,
"
observed
Villiers
.
"
<EOS>
Odds
life
!
<EOS>
this
accountsfor
her
having
fainted
in
the
orchestra
.
<EOS>
I
wondered
what
could
be
thematter
with
her
,
but
now
I
understand
it
.
<EOS>
All
is
prepared
,
"
he
added
,
ina
deep
whisper
to
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
careful
how
you
act
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
find
SirNorfolk
dangerous
,
and
Randulph
Crew
is
on
the
watch
.
<EOS>
""Fear
nothing
<EOS>
,
"
he
rejoined
,
"
I
've
taken
my
measures
securely
.
<EOS>
Maketowards
the
dark
walk
,
and
contrive
to
lead
him
and
the
others
away
.
<EOS>
"Lady
<EOS>
Brabazon
nodded
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
she
arose
,
and
,
without
ceremony
,
took
Sir
Norfolk
's
arm
,
while
Villiers
very
gallantly
offered
his
toHilda
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
party
paired
off
in
like
manner
.
<EOS>
Leading
the
wayin
the
direction
agreed
upon
,
Lady
Brabazon
expressed
a
desire
to
viewthe
scenic
representation
of
the
mill
and
waterfall
before
mentioned
,
which
was
exhibited
in
a
hollow
of
the
great
walk
;
and
they
proceededtowards
it
.
<EOS>
Hilda
was
much
displeased
by
the
assiduities
of
hercompanion
,
and
she
could
not
help
remarking
that
he
contrived
,
onvarious
pretences
,
to
linger
behind
the
rest
of
the
party
,
and
thoughshe
repeatedly
urged
him
to
join
them
,
he
made
always
some
excuse
fornot
doing
so
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
on
pausing
longer
than
usual
,
they
quite
lostsight
of
them
,
and
were
hurrying
forward
at
Hilda
's
urgent
request
,
when
,
as
they
passed
one
of
the
side
vistas
,
Mr.
Cripps
,
who
wasstanding
at
the
end
of
it
,
advanced
towards
his
master
.
<EOS>
"Fortunately
<EOS>
encountered
,
sir
,
"
said
the
valet
,
bowing
;
<EOS>
"
Lady
Brabazonsent
me
to
look
for
you
,
to
tell
you
that
she
and
the
party
are
gonedown
a
walk
on
the
left
,
to
see
a
fine
painting
,
in
the
Chinesepavilion
,
at
the
end
of
it
.
<EOS>
With
your
permission
,
I
'll
shew
you
theway
.
<EOS>
""Oh
<EOS>
yes
,
let
us
go
to
them
by
all
means
,
"
said
Hilda
,
unsuspectingly
.
<EOS>
"Lead
<EOS>
on
,
then
,
"
cried
the
beau
,
scarcely
able
to
conceal
hissatisfaction
at
the
success
of
the
scheme
.
<EOS>
A
few
steps
brought
them
to
the
end
of
a
narrow
walk
,
arched
over
bytrees
,
the
branches
of
which
were
so
thickly
interlaced
,
that
themoonlight
could
not
penetrate
through
them
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
its
appearance
,
Hilda
drew
back
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
thoughtless
of
Sir
Norfolk
to
leave
me
thus
!
<EOS>
"
she
exclaimed
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
you
are
surely
not
afraid
of
accompanying
me
down
this
walk
,
MissScarve
,
"
laughed
the
beau
.
<EOS>
"
My
valet
is
with
us
,
and
shall
protect
you
.
<EOS>
The
Chinese
pavilion
is
not
more
than
a
hundred
yards
off
;
and
the
walk
,
though
dark
,
is
not
solitary
.
<EOS>
"Fancying
<EOS>
she
perceived
some
persons
within
it
,
Hilda
suffered
herself
tobe
led
on
;
but
she
had
not
advanced
many
steps
,
when
all
her
uneasinessreturned
,
and
she
bitterly
regretted
having
assented
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
toolate
.
<EOS>
The
beau
's
grasp
had
tightened
upon
her
arm
,
and
he
drew
herquickly
forward
,
while
Mr.
Cripps
proceeded
at
the
same
rapid
pace
.
<EOS>
Onceor
twice
,
she
thought
she
heard
footsteps
behind
her
,
and
almost
fanciedshe
could
distinguish
a
figure
walking
near
them
,
but
she
did
not
dareto
express
her
terrors
.
<EOS>
They
had
proceeded
,
so
far
as
she
could
judge
,
about
a
hundred
yards
,
when
a
sudden
turn
in
the
walk
disclosed
a
lowhedge
;
beyond
was
the
open
country
,
bathed
in
the
moonlight
.
<EOS>
Coming
to
asudden
halt
,
the
beau
said
in
a
hurried
,
almost
fierce
tone;--"MissScarve
,
I
love
you
to
desperation
,
and
am
determined
to
make
you
mine
.
<EOS>
You
are
now
in
my
power
,
and
must
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
""Never
!
"
replied
Hilda
,
resolutely
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
command
you
to
release
me
.
<EOS>
"She
would
have
screamed
for
help
if
Villiers
,
who
grasped
her
moretightly
,
had
not
taken
out
his
handkerchief
,
and
,
placing
it
over
hermouth
,
prevented
her
cries
.
<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Captain
Culpepperemerged
from
the
trees
,
and
hastened
with
Mr.
Cripps
towards
him
.
<EOS>
"Bravo
<EOS>
,
sir
!
"
cried
the
captain
.
<EOS>
"
All
goes
well
this
time
.
<EOS>
We
'll
haveher
in
the
coach
in
a
twinkling
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
so
fast
,
villains
,
"
thundered
Randulph
,
rushing
forward
.
<EOS>
"
I
haveallowed
you
to
go
thus
far
to
see
to
what
lengths
<EOS>
your
villainy
wouldcarry
you
.
<EOS>
But
you
shall
pay
dearly
for
it
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
he
rushed
to
the
beau
,
and
snatching
Hilda
from
him
,
dashedhim
backwards
with
such
force
that
he
fell
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Anotherperson
likewise
came
to
the
rescue
.
<EOS>
This
was
Jacob
,
who
brandishing
hiscudgel
,
hurried
to
the
scene
of
action
.
<EOS>
On
seeing
him
,
the
valet
whippedout
his
blade
,
but
it
was
beaten
from
his
grasp
,
and
he
only
avoided
aterrible
blow
from
the
cudgel
,
by
a
nimble
leap
aside
.
<EOS>
Without
waitingfor
a
second
blow
,
he
plunged
into
the
wood
,
and
made
his
escape
.
<EOS>
Captain
Culpepper
fared
no
better
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
draw
his
sword
,
hereceived
a
blow
on
the
head
,
that
stretched
him
senseless
and
bleedingon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Hilda
,
meantime
,
had
murmured
her
thanks
to
herdeliverer
,
who
felt
,
as
he
pressed
her
to
his
bosom
,
that
the
whole
ofhis
previous
anxiety
was
more
than
repaid
by
the
unutterable
joy
of
themoment
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
!
<EOS>
"
he
cried
,
passionately
,
"
I
would
risk
a
thousand
lives
for
you
.
<EOS>
Forgive
me
if
,
at
this
moment
,
I
dare
to
ask
if
I
may
hope?"She
murmured
a
faint
response
in
the
affirmative
.
<EOS>
"I
am
the
happiest
of
men
,
"
cried
Randulph
,
transported
with
delight
.
<EOS>
"Alas
!
"
exclaimed
Hilda
,
"
my
avowal
can
give
you
little
happiness
.
<EOS>
I
cannever
be
yours
.
<EOS>
""There
<EOS>
you
speak
truth
,
"
cried
Villiers
,
who
by
this
time
had
regainedhis
feet
,
and
furiously
approached
them
.
<EOS>
"
You
never
shall
be
his
.
<EOS>
""This
is
the
leader
of
the
gang
,
"
cried
Jacob
,
who
having
just
disposedof
Captain
Culpepper
,
now
rushed
towards
the
beau
,
brandishing
hiscudgel
in
a
formidable
manner
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
soon
settle
him
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
him
alone
,
Jacob
,
"
cried
Randulph
,
authoritatively
;
"
hispunishment
belongs
to
me
.
<EOS>
""You're
<EOS>
wrong
,
sir
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
"
but
I
sha'n't
disobey
you
.
<EOS>
Hedoesn't
deserve
to
be
treated
like
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
it
please
you
to
step
aside
with
me
for
a
moment
,
Mr.
Crew
!
"
<EOS>
saidthe
beau
,
with
forced
politeness
.
<EOS>
And
as
Randulph
complied
,
he
added
,
"
Ishall
expect
satisfaction
for
the
injury
you
have
done
me
.
<EOS>
""I
might
well
refuse
it
,
"
replied
Randulph
;
"
but
I
am
too
eager
forvengeance
myself
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
the
satisfaction
you
seek
assoon
as
you
please
.
<EOS>
""To
-
morrow
morning
,
then
at
the
earliest
hour
--
at
five
--
in
TothillFields
,
"
said
Villiers
.
<EOS>
"I
will
be
there
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
And
,
quitting
the
beau
,
he
rejoined
Hilda
,
to
whom
he
offered
his
arm
.
<EOS>
They
walked
down
the
avenue
together
,
Jacob
following
close
beside
them
.
<EOS>
Hilda
allowed
her
hand
to
remain
in
his
,
while
he
poured
the
warmestprotestations
of
attachment
into
her
ear
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
attempt
to
checkhim
,
and
perhaps
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
which
of
the
two
felt
themost
regret
when
that
brief
dream
of
happiness
was
ended
,
as
theyemerged
into
the
lighted
vista
.
<EOS>
Almost
immediately
on
entering
the
great
walk
,
they
met
Sir
Norfolk
andLady
Brabazon
and
the
rest
of
the
party
.
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
was
at
firstgreatly
confused
at
seeing
Randulph
,
but
she
instantly
guessed
what
hadhappened
,
and
tried
to
put
a
good
face
on
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Advancing
toHilda
,
she
hastily
inquired
what
had
happened
;
but
the
latter
turnedcoldly
from
her
,
and
taking
the
arm
of
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
desired
tobe
led
home
.
<EOS>
"Your
<EOS>
ladyship
is
perfectly
aware
of
the
peril
in
which
I
have
beenplaced
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
have
been
delivered
from
it
by
the
courage
andaddress
of
Mr.
Crew
.
<EOS>
""Before
you
go
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
said
Lady
Brabazon
,
"
I
beseech
you
to
giveme
some
explanation
of
what
has
happened
.
<EOS>
""It
must
suffice
,
then
,
to
say
;
that
Mr.
Villiers
has
attempted
to
carryme
off
,
"
replied
Hilda
;
"
but
his
purpose
has
been
defeated
.
<EOS>
""What
is
this
I
hear
!
"
cried
Sir
Norfolk
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Villiers
guilty
of
sobase
an
attempt
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
in
search
of
him
instantly
.
<EOS>
""I
have
undertaken
the
punishment
of
Mr.
Villiers

"
saidRandulph
.
<EOS>
"You
have
an
account
to
settle
with
me
,
yourself
,
sir

"
rejoined
SirNorfolk
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"I
will
settle
it
at
five
o'clock
to

,
in
Tothill

Fields,"replied
Randulph
in
a
low
tone--"after

I

Villiers

<EOS>
""Be
it
<EOS>
so
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
And
he
strode
off
with
Hilda
,
followed
by
Jacob
,
while
Randulph
,
withoutstaying
to
exchange
a
word
with
Lady
Brabazon
,
walked
away
in

CHAPTER
XI.--RANDULPH
WORSTS
BEAU
VILLIERS
IN
A
DUEL
IN
TOTHILL
FIELDS
;
AND
ISWORSTED
HIMSELF
IN
A
SECOND
DUEL
<EOS>
BY
SIR
NORFOLK
SALUSBURY.On
<EOS>
quitting
Vauxhall
,
Randulph
made
the
best
of
his
way
home
,
<EOS>
agitatedby
a
crowd
of
tumultuous
thoughts
.
<EOS>
Abel
had
retired
to
rest
more
than
anhour
ago
,
but
Trussell
was
not
yet
come
home
.
<EOS>
Telling
Mr.
Jukes
,
therefore
,
that
he
must
see
his
younger
uncle
directly
,
he
set
off
againwithout
a
moment
's
delay
,
and
taking
a
boat
at
Lambeth
stairs
,
rowed
tothe
nearest
point
to
Covent
Garden
.
<EOS>
He
then
hurried
to
Tom'scoffee
-
house
,
where
he
found
his
uncle
at
supper
in
a
box
by
himself
,
and
proceeded
to
relate
to
him
all
that
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
"A
pretty
adventure
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Trussell
at
the
close
of
the
recital
.
<EOS>
"An
abduction
prevented
,
and
a
couple
of
duels
.
<EOS>
I
'm
sorry
I
was
n't
withyou
,
that
I
might
have
taken
one
of
the
latter
off
your
hands
.
<EOS>
It
'll
bea
mortal
conflict
with
the
beau
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
you
've
had
lessons
fromHewitt
.
<EOS>
He
told
me
himself
,
not
many
days
ago
,
that
you
were
one
of
hisbest
scholars
,
and
had
as
strong
a
wrist
,
and
as
quick
an
eye
as
any
manhe
knew
.
<EOS>
""I
have
no
fear
of
the
result
in
either
case
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
glad
you
're
so
confident
,
"
said
Trussell
;
"
but
neither
of
yourantagonists
are
to
be
despised
.
<EOS>
Take
a
glass
of
punch
--
well
,
as
youplease
.
<EOS>
We
must
go
and
make
arrangements
instanter
.
<EOS>
Our
best
plan
willbe
to
go
to
Hewitt
,
and
tell
him
to
be
in
the
field
with
swords
and
asurgeon
at
the
appointed
hour
.
"Emptying
<EOS>
the
rummer
of
punch
before
him
<EOS>
,
he
called
to
the
drawer
,
paidhim
,
and
taking
his
nephew
's
arm
,
they
set
forth
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hewitt
lived
inLeicester
-
street
,
Leicester
-
fields
--
<EOS>
now
Leicester
-
square
.
<EOS>
He
was
gone
tobed
,
but
they
soon
knocked
him
up
,
and
explaining
their
business
,
heentered
upon
it
immediately
.
<EOS>
"I'll
be
sure
to
be
on
the
ground
at
the
time
appointed
,
and
will
bringMr
.
<EOS>
Molson
,
the
surgeon
,
with
me
,
"
said
Hewitt
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
will
take
care
ofyou
in
case
of
accident
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
apprehend
any
such
to
you
,
becauseI
know
what
you
can
do
.
<EOS>
You
shall
have
my
favourite
German
blade
--
<EOS>
hereit
is
,
"
he
added
,
taking
down
a
sword
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
the
strongest
andlightest
sword
I
ever
handled
,
and
equal
to
any
Spanish
tuck
.
<EOS>
Be
sureyou
come
coolly
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
The
best
swordsman
that
ever
fought
willbe
worsted
if
he
is
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
You
'll
need
judgment
,
as
well
as
skillto
-
morrow
,
and
take
care
<EOS>
you
do
not
disorder
it
any
way
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Villiers
isa
very
skilful
fencer
,
but
he
is
likely
enough
to
be
in
a
passion
.
<EOS>
As
toSir
Norfolk
,
you
will
find
him
as
calm
as
death
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
far
moredangerous
adversary
than
the
other
.
<EOS>
""Far
more
dangerous
,
"
echoed
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Norfolk
being
so
much
taller
than
yourself
,
"
pursued
thefencing
-
master
,
"
the
best
way
when
you
intend
to
make
a
thrust
at
himwill
be
to
come
to
half
sword
,
you
will
then
be
within
distance
.
<EOS>
If
youact
on
the
defensive
,
engage
only
five
inches
,
and
keep
him
at
thatdistance
.
<EOS>
You
understand?""Perfectly
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
best
thrust
you
can
make
at
him
will
be
seconde
,
or
carte
under
theshell
,
or
you
may
dart
your
sword
as
I
have
taught
you
.
<EOS>
And
now
Irecommend
you
to
go
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Think
no
more
of
the
duel
,
but
sleepsoundly
,
and
come
to
the
field
as
fresh
as
a
lark
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
smiled
at
the
fencing
-
master
's
advice
,
and
having
arranged
ameeting
at
the
horseferry
,
Westminster
,
opposite
Lambeth
stairs
,
athalf
-
past
four
o'clock
,
he
took
his
departure
with
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
Theyreached
home
in
about
half
an
hour
,
and
Mr.
Jukes
expressed
greatdelight
at
seeing
them
.
<EOS>
It
had
been
previously
agreed
,
for
fear
ofmistake
,
that
Trussell
should
sit
up
all
night
,
and
call
his
nephew
insufficient
time
in
the
morning
,
and
he
therefore
ordered
Mr.
Jukes
tobring
him
a
bottle
of
brandy
,
and
a
large
jug
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
The
butlerobeyed
,
and
took
the
opportunity
of
inquiring
whether
anything
was
thematter
,
but
received
no
direct
answer
.
<EOS>
On
retiring
to
his
own
room
,
Randulph
threw
himself
into
a
chair
,
andturned
over
the
events
of
the
day
.
<EOS>
Amid
a
multitude
of
dark
anddisagreeable
thoughts
,
was
one
that
was
bright
and
cheering
.
<EOS>
He
had
seenHilda
,
avowed
his
passion
to
her
,
and
received
an
assurance
that
he
wasnot
indifferent
to
her
.
<EOS>
This
thought
buoyed
him
up
,
and
made
him
regardwith
indifference
the
danger
to
which
he
was
exposed
.
<EOS>
His
most
painfulreflections
were
connected
with
his
mother
,
and
knowing
the
anguish
shewould
experience
if
anything
should
happen
to
him
,
he
sat
down
and
wrotea
letter
,
full
of
filial
affection
and
tenderness
,
to
be
delivered
toher
in
case
of
his
fall
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
he
threw
himself
on
his
couch
,
buthis
mind
was
too
much
disturbed
to
allow
him
to
sleep
.
<EOS>
Long
before
itwas
light
,
he
arose
and
dressed
himself
,
and
when
Trussell
entered
theroom
,
he
was
on
his
knees
at
the
bedside
,
at
prayer
.
<EOS>
On
rising
,
he
gavethe
letter
he
had
written
to
the
charge
of
his
uncle
,
and
they
creptdownstairs
as
softly
as
they
could
,
for
fear
of
disturbing
anyone
in
thehouse
.
<EOS>
They
then
proceeded
to
the
dining
-
room
,
where
Trussell
swalloweda
glass
of
brandy
to
keep
the
cold
out
of
his
stomach
,
and
recommendedhis
nephew
to
do
the
same
to
steady
his
hand
,
but
the
latter
,
doubtingthe
efficacy
of
the
prescription
,
declined
it
.
<EOS>
Their
hope
of
gettingaway
proved
fallacious
,
for
as
they
entered
the
hall
on
their
way
to
theouter
door
,
they
found
Abel
standing
there
,
wrapped
in
hisdressing
-
gown
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
,
eyeing
his
nephew
severely--"You
are
going
to
fighta
duel
.
<EOS>
It
is
useless
to
deny
it
.
<EOS>
I
am
sure
you
are
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
attempt
to
deny
it
,
sir
,
"
replied
Randulph
;
"
I
am
.
<EOS>
""He
is
going
to
fight
two
duels
,
brother
,
"
said
Trussell
,
emboldened
bythe
brandy
he
had
just
swallowed
.
<EOS>
"Two
duels
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Abel--"then
he
is
doubly
foolish
--
doubly
cupable
.
<EOS>
Randulph
,
you
are
about
to
commit
a
very
sinful
and
very
foolish
action
,
and
though
you
may
be
justified
in
what
you
do
by
the
laws
of
honour
,
and
the
usage
of
society
,
you
will
not
be
justified
before
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""Really
,
my
dear
sir
,
"
said
Trussell
,
<EOS>
"
you
view
this
matter
much
tooseriously
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
a
whit
,
"
replied
Abel
,
"
Randulph
might
stop
if
he
would
rather
runthe
risk
of
offending
his
Maker
than
man
.
<EOS>
""Uncle
,
"
said
Randulph
,
"
I
can
not
now
argue
with
you
;
but
I
have
goodreasons
for
what
I
am
about
to
do
.
<EOS>
""No
reason
can
warrant
bloodshed
,
"
replied
Abel
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Since
you
aredeaf
to
my
counsels
,
go
.
<EOS>
Yet
think
what
a
blow
it
will
be
to
yourmother
,
if
she
finds
on
her
arrival
,
that
she
has
lost
her
son
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
thought
of
that
,
uncle
,
"
replied
Randulph
;
"
and
I
have
left
aletter
with
my
uncle
Trussell
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
you
will
now
permit
me
to
commitits
charge
to
you
.
<EOS>
""Here
<EOS>
it
is
sir
,
"
said
Trussell
,
handing
him
the
letter
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Time
presses
.
<EOS>
We
must
be
gone
.
<EOS>
We
hope
to
back
again
with
you
at
breakfast
,
and
tomake
a
hearty
and
merry
meal
.
<EOS>
We
are
quite
sorry
to
have
disturbed
you
.
<EOS>
Good
morning
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"Abel
threw
a
severe
and
disgusted
look
at
him
,
and
then
turning
toRandulph
,
pressed
his
hand
affectionately
,
and
said
,
"
I
hope
I
may
seeyou
at
breakfast
,
and
with
no
blood
on
your
soul
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
these
words
,
he
walked
away
.
<EOS>
"Devlish
<EOS>
unlucky
we
should
meet
him
!
"
<EOS>
said
Trussell
,
forcing
a
laugh
,
asthey
quitted
the
house
.
<EOS>
"
I
suppose
Jukes
must
have
suspected
something
,
and
called
him
up
,
for
I
do
n't
think
he
could
have
overheard
us
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
made
no
reply
,
for
Abel
's
parting
speech
had
sunk
deep
into
hisbreast
,
and
they
proceeded
in
silence
towards
the
palace
stairs
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fresh
and
beautiful
morning
,
though
the
sun
was
scarcely
risen
,
and
a
thin
silvery
mist
hung
like
a
veil
over
the
smooth
surface
of
thewater
.
<EOS>
Two
or
three
watermen
were
lying
asleep
in
their
tilts
,
and
theyroused
one
of
them
,
who
speedily
rowed
them
to
the
opposite
bank
,
nearwhich
<EOS>
they
found
Mr.
Hewitt
with
a
couple
of
swords
under
his
arm
,
inaddition
to
the
one
by
his
side
,
accompanied
by
a
tall
stout
man
with
ared
face
,
dressed
in
a
well
-
powdered
wig
,
and
a
suit
of
purple
velvet
,
and
carrying
a
gold
-
headed
cane
,
who
was
introduced
as
Mr.
Molson
,
thesurgeon
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
look
famously
,
"
said
the
fencing
-
master
to
Randulph
:
"
follow
myinstructions
,
and
you
're
sure
to
come
off
victorious
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
party
then
walked
along
the
Horseferry
Road
,
which
speedily
broughtthem
to
Tothill
Fields
.
<EOS>
They
were
the
first
on
the
ground
,
and
Mr
.
<EOS>
Hewitt
,
after
looking
about
for
a
short
time
,
discovered
a
spotexcellently
adapted
for
the
encounters
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
sun
having
risen
,
the
morning
's
early
promise
ofbeauty
was
fully
confirmed
.
<EOS>
The
spot
selected
for
the
combats
commandeda
fine
view
of
Westminster
Abbey
,
which
reared
its
massive
body
and
talltowers
above
a
range
of
mean
habitations
masking
its
back
.
<EOS>
A
cloud
ofcawing
jackdaw
's
wheeled
in
the
sunny
air
above
its
pinnacles
.
<EOS>
A
calmeror
more
beautiful
scene
could
not
be
imagined
.
<EOS>
Randulph
's
reflectionswere
interrupted
by
the
approach
of
two
persons
from
the
left
of
thefields
,
who
proved
to
be
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
and
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
bowed
stiffly
to
Randulph
,
and
also
to
Trussell
,
and
seeingthat
the
beau
was
not
arrived
,
said
to
the
former
,
"
As
I
am
first
in
thefield
,
I
am
entitled
to
the
first
bout
.
<EOS>
""I
am
sorry
I
can
not
oblige
you
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
replied
Randulph
;
"
but
Imust
give
Mr.
Villiers
priority
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
as
you
please
,
sir
,
"
said
the
baronet
,
walking
aside
.
<EOS>
Cordwell
Firebras
then
advanced
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
here
as
Sir
Norfolk'ssecond
,
"
he
said
;
"
but
I
hope
the
matter
may
only
serve
as
a
littlebreathing
for
you
both
before
breakfast
.
<EOS>
It
is
an
idle
quarrel
.
<EOS>
We
musttalk
about
Villiers
's
attempt
anon
.
<EOS>
But
here
he
is
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
two
chairs
were
seen
approaching
from
the
lower
end
of
thefields
.
<EOS>
When
they
came
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
party
,
theystopped
,
and
from
the
first
issued
Mr.
Villiers
,
and
from
the
other
SirBulkeley
Price
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Cripps
walked
by
the
side
of
his
master
's
chair
,
bearing
a
water
-
bottle
and
a
glass
.
<EOS>
The
new
-
comers
advanced
slowlytowards
the
party
,
and
Mr.
Villiers
having
bowed
with
much
haughtinessto
Randulph
,
gracefully
saluted
the
rest
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
"Have
we
anything
to
wait
for
,
gentlemen
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
,
"
replied
Trussell
;
"
we
are
all
ready
.
<EOS>
""To
business
,
then
,
"
rejoined
the
beau
.
<EOS>
At
a
motion
from
his
master
,
Mr.
Cripps
advanced
towards
him
,
andreceiving
his
clouded
cane
,
proceeded
to
divest
him
of
his
coat
,
leavinghim
on
a
light
striped
silk
waistcoat
,
with
sleeves
of
the
samematerial
.
<EOS>
Randulph
,
meantime
,
threw
off
his
upper
garment
,
and
rolled
upthe
shirt
-
sleeve
on
his
right
arm
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Hewitt
then
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
gave
him
the
German
sword
he
had
promised
;
while
Mr.
Villiersreceived
an
exquisitely
tempered
blade
from
the
valet
.
<EOS>
Thesepreparations
made
,
the
seconds
and
bystanders
fell
back
a
few
paces
,
Trussell
,
Firebras
,
and
Hewitt
retiring
on
one
side
,
and
the
twobaronets
on
the
other
,
while
the
surgeon
stood
at
a
little
distance
inthe
rear
with
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
Advancing
towards
each
other
,
the
combatants
saluted
;
and
in
an
anothermoment
their
blades
were
crossed
,
and
several
rapid
passes
exchanged
.
<EOS>
The
spectators
watched
the
conflict
with
the
greatest
interest
,
for
bothparties
appeared
admirably
matched
,
and
the
beau
's
superior
skill
wascounterbalanced
by
Randulph
's
extraordinary
vigour
and
quickness
.
<EOS>
Thrusts
were
made
and
parried
on
both
sides
,
but
not
a
single
hit
wasgiven
,
until
Randulph
,
finding
his
adversary
engaged
in
tierce
with
ahigh
point
,
made
a
firm
thrust
in
carte
over
the
arm
,
and
passed
hissword
through
the
fleshy
part
of
the
other
's
shoulder
.
<EOS>
At
thissuccessful
hit
,
the
seconds
rushed
forward
,
but
before
they
reached
thespot
,
the
beau
's
sword
fell
from
his
grasp
.
<EOS>
"It
is
nothing
,
"
said
Villiers
,
surrendering
himself
to
the
surgeon
,
wholikewise
hurried
towards
him
;
"
but
I
acknowledge
myself
defeated
.
<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
the
beau
's
wound
was
bound
up
by
the
surgeon
,
and
he
was
led
tothe
chair
by
Mr.
Cripps
,
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
who
had
been
a
watchfulspectator
of
the
conflict
,
stepped
forward
,
and
said
to
Randulph,"Whatever
may
be
the
issue
of
our
encounter
,
Mr.
Crew
,
I
shall
declarethat
,
in
the
combat
which
has
just
taken
place
,
you
have
conductedyourself
like
a
man
of
honour
and
spirit
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
receive
the
acknowledgment
from
you
,
Sir
Norfolk
,
"
repliedRandulph
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
"Pray
do
not
hurry
yourself
on
my
account
,
"
said
the
baronet
,
courteously
.
<EOS>
"I
am
quite
ready
for
you
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
What
I
have
gone
throughhas
only
served
to
steady
my
nerves
.
<EOS>
"With
the
assistance
of
Firebras
,
who
had
come
over
to
him
<EOS>
,
Sir
Norfolkthen
took
off
his
coat
,
waistcoat
,
and
shirt
;
and
in
this
statepresented
so
extraordinary
an
appearance
,
that
Randulph
could
scarcelyrepress
a
smile
.
<EOS>
The
punctilious
old
knight
's
first
step
was
to
deliverhis
sword
to
Mr.
Hewitt
,
who
,
on
measuring
it
with
that
of
Randulph
,
found
that
it
exceeded
the
latter
in
length
by
two
inches
.
<EOS>
He
thereforegave
him
one
of
his
own
swords
;
and
Sir
Norfolk
,
beating
an
appeal
withhis
right
foot
,
bade
his
youthful
opponent
come
on
.
<EOS>
Having
gone
throughtheir
salutes
with
the
greatest
formality
,
they
commenced
the
combatwith
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
acted
chiefly
upon
the
defensive
,
and
contented
himself
almost
entirely
with
parrying
the
thrusts
aimed
athim
.
<EOS>
Randulph
soon
found
that
he
had
a
formidable
antagonist
to
dealwith
,
and
,
altering
his
plan
,
tried
to
compel
him
to
attack
him
.
<EOS>
He
madeseveral
feints
with
great
dexterity
,
and
just
touched
his
adversary'sbreast
with
an
inside
thrust
in
carte
,
causing
a
slight
effusion
ofblood
.
<EOS>
This
had
the
effect
of
rousing
the
old
baronet
into
exertion
,
andin
his
turn
<EOS>
he
became
the
assailant
.
<EOS>
He
attacked
Randulph
with
suchforce
and
fury
,
that
he
drove
him
back
several
paces
.
<EOS>
The
young
manreturned
to
the
charge
,
and
pressed
his
adversary
in
his
turn
,
so
thathe
regained
his
ground
;
but
,
while
making
a
pass
in
carte
,
his
sword
wasturned
near
the
wrist
by
a
dexterous
and
sudden
lunge
on
the
part
of
thebaronet
,
whose
point
entered
his
side
below
the
elbow
,
and
inflicted
asevere
wound
.
<EOS>
Maddened
by
the
pain
,
Randulph
continued
to
fightdesperately
;
but
the
seconds
rushed
between
the
combatants
,
and
,
interposing
their
blades
,
declared
that
the
strife
must
terminate
,
andthat
Sir
Norfolk
was
the
victor
.
<EOS>
The
baronet
immediately
dropped
hissword
;
and
Randulph
,
whose
strength
had
been
fast
failing
,
fell
to
theground
insensible
.

AFTER

THAT
<EOS>
RANDULPH
HAD
BEEN
WOUNDED
IN
THE
DUEL
;
AND
WHAT
PASSEDBETWEEN
CORDWELL
FIREBRAS
AND
THE
MISER.Assistance
was
promptly
afforded
Randulph
,
after
his
fall
,
by
thesurgeon
.
<EOS>
Placed
in
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
's
chair
,
he
was
removed
to
thenearest
tavern
in
the
Horseferry
Road
,
where
his
wound
was
dressed
.
<EOS>
SirNorfolk
Salusbury
,
who
expressed
great
concern
about
him
,
followed
himthither
as
soon
as
he
had
bound
up
his
wound
,
and
put
on
hishabiliments
,
and
appeared
greatly
relieved
when
the
surgeon
gave
him
hispositive
assurance
that
no
danger
whatever
was
to
be
apprehended
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
that
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Randulph
in
a
faint
voice
.
<EOS>
"It
is
,
"
replied
the
baronet
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
"Our
<EOS>
quarrel
is
now
at
an
end
,
I
trust
?
"
said
the
young
man
,
extendinghis
hand
,
which
the
other
grasped
cordially
.
<EOS>
"In
<EOS>
toto
,
"
replied
Sir
Norfolk
;
"
and
not
merely
is
it
at
an
end
,
but
afriendship
,
I
hope
,
has
commenced
between
us
from
this
date
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
shall
hold
it
cheaply
purchased
on
my
part
,
if
it
proves
so
,
"
repliedRandulph
,
smiling
gratefully
.
<EOS>
"My
first
business
shall
be
to
call
on
Hilda
Scarve
to
tell
her
howbravely
you
have
combated
in
her
defence
,
"
said
Sir
Norfolk
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
will
for
ever
oblige
me
,
"
replied
the
young
man
,
trying
to
raisehimself
,
but
sinking
back
the
next
moment
,
exhausted
by
the
effort
.
<EOS>
"I
must
interdict
further
conversation
,
gentlemen
,
"
interposed
thesurgeon
;
"
the
bleeding
has
recommenced
,
and
the
pulse
has
risen
.
<EOS>
If
I
amleft
alone
with
my
patient
for
a
few
hours
,
I
will
answer
for
his
doingwell
,
but
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
room
was
then
cleared
,
and
Sir
Norfolk
invited
the
others
tobreakfast
with
him
at
his
lodgings
in
Abingdon
Street
;
and
Trussell
,
finding
that
his
attendance
was
not
required
,
but
that
he
was
rather
inthe
way
than
otherwise
,
accepted
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
Everything
belonging
to
Sir
Norfolk
was
as
formal
as
himself
.
<EOS>
He
had
anold
servant
,
the
stiffest
and
tallest
of
his
class
,
who
moved
like
anautomaton
worked
by
rusty
springs
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
he
had
a
favouritegreyhound
,
who
would
allow
no
one
to
caress
him
but
his
master
;
and
apeacock
,
his
especial
favourite
,
which
used
to
strut
backwards
andforwards
with
him
for
hours
together
in
a
little
garden
at
the
back
ofthe
house
.
<EOS>
Inhospitality
formed
no
part
of
the
worthy
old
baronet'scharacter
,
and
a
very
plentiful
repast
was
set
before
his
guests
.
<EOS>
Despising
tea
and
coffee
as
effeminate
and
enervating
beverages
,
benevertheless
offered
them
to
his
guests
,
but
they
were
declined
by
all
,
and
the
light
claret
substituted

A

to

Sir

applied
himself
,

declared
he

a

<EOS>
"Your

early

said

"Perhaps
<EOS>
so

replied
the

again
applying

"Aqua

After

the

broke
up

settingout
to
see
how
his

went
on

Sir

Firebrasproceeding
to
the
Little

to
call

the

<EOS>
Not
havingseen
his
daughter
overnight
,
for
he
did
not
wait
up
for
her
,
Mr.
Scarveonly
became
acquainted
with
the
beau
's
attempt
to
carry
her
off
,
on
thefollowing
morning
.
<EOS>
The
relation
of
the
matter
threw
him
into
a
violentpassion
,
and
when
,
shortly
afterwards
,
Jacob
ushered
in
Sir
NorfolkSalusbury
and
Firebras
,
who
called
to
acquaint
him
with
the
result
<EOS>
ofthe
two
duels
,
they
found
him
in
a
state
of
the
greatest
excitement
.
<EOS>
Without
allowing
the
baronet
time
to
utter
a
word
,
he
rushed
up
to
him
,
and
,
in
a
voice
half
choked
by
fury
,
exclaimed--"Have
<EOS>
you
killedhim?--have
you
killed
him?""Do
you
allude
to
Mr.

demanded
Sir

calmly
.
<EOS>
"No

beau

to
Villiers

rejoined
the
miser

<EOS>
"I
have
not
engaged

replied
the

baronet

he
has
metwith
due
chastisement
from
Mr.

<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it

rejoined
the

I
should
have
beenpleased

his
villainy
had
been
punished
by

<EOS>
You

are
in

<EOS>
""I
can
make
due
allowance
for
your

Mr.

the
baronet
;

<EOS>
interrupted
the
miser--"why
<EOS>
did
you
let
Hilda
out
ofyour

<EOS>
Since
you
undertook
the

it

your

<EOS>
""I
feel
there
is
reason

you

replied
SirNorfolk

"
nevertheless--""I
want
no
explanation

cried
the
miser

fiercely
;
"
it
is
sufficientfor
me
that
the

has
happened

And
look
how
it
stands:--My

off

Can
anything

repliedSir

<EOS>
sternly
,
for
his
forbearance

""I

exasperated

"Whew

with

whistle

""Mr

""Ay

Firebras

in

low
tone

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mr

""I
believe
you

replied
the

in

"
I
will
regard
it

infirmity

""Sir

said
Hilda
,
speaking
with
forced
calmness--"some

he
put
me
so
hardly
to

that

that--""Well

Hilda

breathlessly

receiving

myself

a

cured

I
slightly
wounded

<EOS>
""I
was

Sir

he
forced

"Thank

<EOS>
she
exclaimed

with
a
gasp
for
utterance

she
fellinto
the

stood
close

<EOS>
"It

Cordwell
Firebras

<EOS>
"It
is
plain

loves

said
Sir

"
<EOS>
And
,
for

""Worthy

sullenly

<EOS>
"It

not

rejoined
Sir

<EOS>
would
I

satisfied

<EOS>
""My

coldly

<EOS>
"I
am
truly
sorry

"
replied
the
old
baronet
.
<EOS>
"Excuse
<EOS>
me
,
Sir

"
said
Firebras
,
seeing
that
the
other
was
aboutto
take
leave

I
have
a
few
words
to
say
to
Mr.

<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Norfolk
then
bowed
,
quitted
the
room

was
ushered
to

<EOS>
While
this
was
passing
,
Cordwell
Firebras
seated
himself
very
composedlyon
a
stool
near
the
chair

the

had
just
taken

<EOS>
"I

,
Mr.

there
are
no

glancingtowards

<EOS>
"I

hope
not

replied
the

who
eyed
him
with
great
repugnance;"but
if
you
have
any
secret
matters
to
discuss

you
had
better
speak
ina
low
tone

<EOS>
""Very
<EOS>
well

"
resumed
Firebras
,
complying
with
the
hint
,
"
we
must
have
alittle
talk
together
about
this
young
man

this
Randulph
Crew

""I
guessed
what
was
coming

groaned
the

<EOS>
"You
can
not
now
mistake
your

partiality

pursuedFirebras
;

,
on
the

I
can
tell
you
that
he
is
devotedlyattached

""Likely
<EOS>
enough

the

I

""You

Firebras

coldly

moved
uneasily

dispute
my

compel

Firebras

I
have

to

drily

HER
SOLICITUDE
ABOUT
HER
SON
;
AND
HER
CONVERSATION
WITH
ABEL.In
<EOS>
the
course
of
the
afternoon
,
Randulph
was
transported
to
his
uncle'shouse
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
He
was
feverish
and
restless
,
and
kept
constantlyinquiring
after
his
mother
,
declaring
he
was
sure
she
had
arrived
,
butwas
kept
out
of
sight
.
<EOS>
An
opiate
having
been
administered
,
he
presentlybegan
to
experience
its
effects
,
and
sank
into
a
profound
slumber
,
fromwhich
he
did
not
wake
till
late
in
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
When
he
opened
his
eyes
,
he
found
the
surgeon
seated
by
his
bedsidefeeling
his
pulse
.
<EOS>
"You
are
wonderfully
better
,
and
wholly
free
from
fever
,
sir
,
"
said
Mr
.
Molson
;
"
and
if
you
can
promise
me
to
keep
all
emotion
under
control
,
<EOS>
Ithink
<EOS>
I
may
yield
to
the
entreaties
of
one
who
is
most
anxious
to
seeyou
.
<EOS>
""My
mother
!
"
exclaimed
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
admit
her
by
all
means
.
<EOS>
Herpresence
will
calm
,
rather
than
excite
me
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
quite
so
sure
of
that
,
"
hesitated
Molson
;
"
however
,
I
willrisk
it
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
quitting
the
room
,
he
returned
the
next
moment
and
introduced
Mrs
.
Crew
,
who
uttered
a
slight
cry
,
and
would
have
rushed
forward
,
but
hedetained
her
,
whispering--"Remember
your
promise
,
madam
.
<EOS>
It
was
only
onthe
understanding
that
you
would
maintain
your
composure
that
I
allowedyou
to
see
him
.
<EOS>
"Thus
<EOS>
cautioned
,
Mrs.
Crew
softly
approached
the
bed
,
and
taking
the
handwhich
her
son
extended
to
her
,
pressed
it
to
her
lips
.
<EOS>
She
said
nothing
,
but
her
bosom
heaved
quickly
,
and
Randulph
felt
that
the
hot
tears
werefalling
fast
upon
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
distress
yourself
,
dearest
mother
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
am
already
sowell
that
if
this
gentleman
would
allow
me
,
I
could
get
up
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
son
is
doing
exceedingly
well
,
madam
,
"
said
Mr.
Molson
,
significantly
;
"
and
if
we
pay
him
due
attention
,
he
may
leave
his
bed
inthree
or
four
days
.
<EOS>
"Roused
<EOS>
by
this
remark
,
Mrs.
Crew
looked
up
,
and
fixed
a
glance
full
ofinexpressible
tenderness
and
affection
upon
her
son
.
<EOS>
Though
hercountenance
bore
traces
of
much
sorrow
and
anxiety
,
she
was
still
a
veryhandsome
woman
,
and
had
a
tall
,
fine
figure
,
full
as
became
her
years
,
yet
not
so
full
as
to
interfere
with
the
gracefulness
of
itsproportions
.
<EOS>
She
was
two
years
younger
than
Trussell
,
being
justforty
-
four
,
and
might
have
been
thought
much
younger
,
but
for
thecare
-
worn
expression
above
-
mentioned
,
which
while
it
added
age
to
herfeatures
,
lent
interest
to
them
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
Her
lineamentsstrikingly
resembled
those
of
her
son
,
but
were
more
delicately
formed
,
and
her
eyes
were
blue
,
large
,
and
of
the
purest
water
.
<EOS>
She
was
dressedin
deep
mourning
,
of
simple
material
,
and
wore
her
own
hair
,
originallyof
a
bright
and
beautiful
brown
,
but
now
mingled
with
grey
.
<EOS>
Charms
such
as
Mrs.
Crew
possessed
,
must
,
it
is
scarcely
necessary
tosay
,
have
won
her
many
admirers
,
when
they
were
at
their
best
;
and
somefour
and
twenty
years
ago
she
was
sought
on
all
hands
,
and
had
manybrilliant
alliances
proposed
to
her
;
but
her
heart
was
early
engaged
tohim
to
whom
she
was
eventually
united
;
and
she
continued
true
to
hismemory
,
for
,
though
two
of
her
old
admirers
found
her
out
in
herwidowhood
,
and
renewed
the
proposals
made
in
the
meridian
of
herattractions
--
and
though
both
these
offers
were
advantageous
,
while
herown
worldly
circumstances
,
as
has
been
shewn
,
were
so
much
reduced
asalmost
to
justify
a
marriage
of
convenience
,
both
were
unhesitatinglyrejected
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Crew
partook
of
the
good
qualities
of
both
her
brothers
.
<EOS>
Shepossessed
the
sound
judgment
and
kindliness
of
Abel
,
without
hisasperity
;
and
she
had
much
of
the
good
nature
,
without
the
worldlinessof
Trussell
.
<EOS>
Throughout
the
whole
of
her
married
life
,
her
conduct
hadbeen
most
exemplary
.
<EOS>
Devotedly
attached
to
her
husband
,
she
strove
bythe
care
which
she
paid
to
the
management
of
the
affairs
entrusted
toher
,
to
make
up
in
some
degree
for
his
extravagance
,
and
though
she
wasunable
entirely
to
accomplish
her
object
,
she
did
much
to
retard
hisprogress
towards
ruin
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Crew
was
one
of
those
persons
who
whatevertheir
fortune
,
will
live
beyond
it
.
<EOS>
Excellent
-
hearted
and
hospitable
,
bekept
open
house
,
a
dozen
hunters
,
twice
as
many
servants
,
a
pack
ofhounds
,
and
was
not
overparticular
in
the
choice
of
his
associates
.
<EOS>
Theconsequence
was
that
he
speedily
became
embarrassed
,
and
instead
ofretrenching
,
raised
money
in
the
readiest
way
he
could
,
and
lived
harderand
more
recklessly
than
ever
.
<EOS>
He
was
fond
of
horse
-
racing
andcock
-
fighting
,
and
though
by
no
means
a
gambler
,
frequently
lost
more
atplay
than
a
prudent
gentleman
would
care
to
lose
.
<EOS>
As
Randulph
grew
up
,
he
perceived
the
necessity
of
retrenchment
,
and
for
nearly
a
year
,
decidedly
changed
his
mode
of
life
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
adapted
by
nature
<EOS>
tofollow
up
such
a
course
with
perseverance
.
<EOS>
Long
before
the
fear
wasover
,
he
began
to
find
his
plans
of
economy
irksome
,
and
at
the
end
ofit
,
launched
into
his
old
expenses
.
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
some
designingpersons
got
hold
of
him
.
<EOS>
Advances
were
made
on
most
usurious
terms
,
andhe
soon
became
inextricably
involved
.
<EOS>
For
the
last
two
years
of
hislife
,
he
drank
hard
,
discontinued
most
of
the
healthful
exercises
,
towhich
he
had
been
accustomed
,
seldom
hunted
,
and
amused
himself
chieflywith
bowling
.
<EOS>
This
fatal
course
soon
begin
to
tell
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Theinfirmities
of
age
came
on
before
their
time
,
and
he
died
under
fifty
,
with
every
appearance
of
an
old
man
.
<EOS>
On
examination
,
his
affairs
werefound
frightfully
embarrassed
,
and
Randulph
,
who
had
just
come
of
age
,
having
stated
his
intentions
to
his
father
before
his
death
,
andobtained
his
mother
's
assent
to
the
arrangement
,
assigned
the
whole
ofthe
entailed
property
to
the
creditors
,
retaining
only
for
himself
<EOS>
whatwould
barely
afford
him
the
means
of
living
.
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crew
,
it
has
beenstated
,
had
a
small
separate
property
of
her
own
,
settled
upon
her
byher
father
,
at
the
time
of
her
marriage
;
but
between
mother
and
son
,
they
had
not
now
in
hundreds
a
year
,
what
Mr.
Crew
had
once
had
inthousands
.
<EOS>
Throughout
all
the
trying
circumstances
above
-
narrated
,
Mrs.
Crew
hadconducted
herself
admirably
.
<EOS>
She
never
irritated
her
husband
withreproaches
,
nor
wearied
him
with
advice
,
which
her
good
sense
told
herwould
be
unavailing
;
but
assisted
him
us
far
as
was
in
her
power
,
andcheered
him
in
his
distresses
,
taking
care
not
to
let
her
own
afflictionbe
apparent
.
<EOS>
At
no
time
,
did
she
ever
complain
of
him
,
even
to
herbrothers
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
could
not
complain
of
ill
treatment
,
for
Mr.
Crewwas
sincerely
attached
to
her
,
and
but
for
his
imprudence
they
mighthave
been
as
happy
a
couple
as
ever
lived
.
<EOS>
The
sweetness
and
amiabilityof
her
disposition
was
evinced
on
all
occasions
,
but
never
so
stronglyas
during
the
last
two
years
of
her
husband
's
life
,
when
his
debilitatedconstitution
,
and
pressing
cares
,
impaired
his
naturally
good
temper
,
and
rendered
him
fretful
,
and
impatient
of
trifles
.
<EOS>
The
tenderest
attachment
subsisted
between
Randulph
and
his
mother
.
<EOS>
Having
always
treated
him
with
confidence
,
he
had
no
reserve
from
her
,
but
regarded
her
in
the
light
both
of
a
parent
and
friend
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Crew
remained
nearly
an
hour
by
her
son
's
bedside
,
gazing
at
him
,
and
answering
the
questions
he
put
to
her
about
her
journey
and
othermatters
,
as
briefly
as
possible
;
for
,
in
compliance
with
the
surgeon'sinjunctions
,
she
avoided
anything
like
continuous
discourse
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
discerning
some
slight
symptoms
of
fatigue
about
him
,
she
pressed
hishand
softly
,
and
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
On
going
down
stairs
,
she
proceededto
the
library
,
where
she
found
her
brothers
.
<EOS>
Trussell
anxiouslyinquired
how
she
had
left
the
patient
.
<EOS>
"He
is
doing
well
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
"
she
replied
;
"
<EOS>
but
oh
!
<EOS>
brother
,
what
ameeting
has
this
been
!
<EOS>
I
trust
it
is
the
last
duel
he
will
ever
beengaged
in
.
<EOS>
""I
think
he
has
come
off
famously
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
I
called
toinquire
after
Villiers
last
night
,
and
I
understand
he
is
likely
to
belaid
up
for
a
fortnight
at
the
least
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
"
observed
Abel
;
"
and
I
wish
from
my
heart
thatRandulph
's
wound
had
been
more
severe
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
brother
!
<EOS>
why
such
a
wish
as
that
?
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"Because
I
would
have
his
first
duel
his
last
,
sister
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
Ientirely
disapprove
of
the
practice
of
duelling
,
and
think
it
utterlyopposed
to
the
religious
principles
we
profess
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
duel
is
a
necessity
imposed
upon
society
,
"
said
Trussell
,
"
and
,
inmy
opinion
,
never
can
be
dispensed
with
,
unless
a
total
revolution
takesplace
in
our
manners
and
habits
.
<EOS>
It
is
the
only
check
that
holds
certaincharacters
in
restraint
,
and
though
the
practice
may
be
carried
too
far
,
and
swords
be
drawn
on
trifling
occasions
,
a
great
good
is
accomplishedby
the
recognition
and
maintenance
of
a
code
of
honour
,
to
which
allgentlemen
must
subscribe
,
and
any
infraction
of
which
is
fatal
.
<EOS>
Moralists
may
preach
as
they
please
,
but
as
long
as
society
isconstituted
as
it
is
as
present
--
as
long
as
such
men
as
Villiersexist
--
duelling
must
,
and
will
prevail
.
<EOS>
""There
are
other
modes
of
avenging
an
injury
besides
violence
,
"
repliedAbel
;
"
and
I
trust
society
in
some
more
enlightened
age
will
fix
such
abrand
upon
the
evil
doer
,
that
it
shall
be
in
itself
sufficientpunishment
for
his
offence
.
<EOS>
As
we
are
now
circumstanced
,
it
may
beimpossible
for
a
gentleman
to
avoid
a
quarrel
;
but
he
should
nevervoluntarily
seek
it
.
<EOS>
""I
am
bound
to
say
,
in
Randulph
's
justification
,
"
rejoined
Trussell,"since
you
both
view
the
matter
in
so
grave
a
light
,
and
I
say
itadvisedly
,
that
he
has
acted
throughout
this
affair
as
becomes
agentleman
,
and
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
Such
is
the
opinion
of
both
hisadversaries
--
and
such
is
my
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
You
have
reason
to
be
proud
ofhim
,
Sophia
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
once
thought
so
,
"
she
replied
,
sadly
.
"And
<EOS>
believe
me
,
he
has
done
nothing
to
forfeit
your
good
<EOS>
opinion,"rejoined
<EOS>
Trussell
;
"
but
much
that
should
raise
it
.
<EOS>
""I
am
not
alone
annoyed
at
the
duels
,
"
said
Abel
;
"
but
at
the
cause
ofthem
.
<EOS>
It
was
my
particular
wish
that
Randulph
should
avoid
HildaScarve
--
<EOS>
my
expressed
wish
--
<EOS>
and
now
he
has
been
so
circumstanced
withher
,
that
any
feeling
he
might
entertain
towards
her
will
be
greatlystrengthened
.
<EOS>
Trussell
,
you
have
laid
up
for
your
charge
a
great
storeof
unhappiness
.
<EOS>
He
will
soon
be
cured
of
the
wound
he
has
received
inthis
encounter,--but
<EOS>
will
his
passion
for
Hilda
be
equally
soon
cured?""That
is
impossible
to
say
,
"
replied
Trussell
;
"
some
men
easily
get
overa
disappointment
in
love
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
others
,
never
!
"
rejoined
Abel
,
bitterly
.
<EOS>
"I
meant
no
allusion
to
you
,
sir
,
"
cried
Trussell
,
reddening
;
"
nonewhatever
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
did
I
suspect
you
of
doing
so
,
"
returned
Abel
;
"
but
if
Randulphloves
sincerely
,
he
will
feel
the
blow
to
his
dying
day
.
<EOS>
""And
if
he
does
love
sincerely
,
sir
,
why
,
oh
!
<EOS>
why
,
interfere
between
himand
the
object
of
his
affections
?
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
no
not
interfere
with
him
--
God
forbid
<EOS>
I
should
do
so
!
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
him
marry
Hilda
,
if
he
will
.
<EOS>
Let
him
obtain
her
father
's
consent
,
if
he
can

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
will
you
give
your
consent

sir

"
cried
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"No
;
"
replied
Abel
,
emphatically
,
"
I
will
not
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
when
he
firstsaw
the
girl
,
to
avoid
her
on
pain
of
my
displeasure
.
<EOS>
He
has
disobeyedme
,
and
must
take
the
consequences
.
<EOS>
But
what
matters
my
consent
?
<EOS>
I
willhave
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
.
<EOS>
I
wash
my
hands
of
it
altogether
.
<EOS>
Ihave
my
own
reasons
,
which
suffice
to
myself
,
for
objecting
to
theunion
;
but
I
will
not
be
placed
in
a
painful
and
ungracious
position
,
and
be
compelled
to
oppose
it
.
<EOS>
I
will
have
nothing
to
do
withit
--
<EOS>
nothing
<EOS>
whatever
.
<EOS>
""Randulph
will
incur
your
displeasure
if
he
marries
Hilda
,
<EOS>
will
he
not?"said
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"Most
assuredly
,
"
replied
Abel
;
"
I
will
never
see
him
or
her
again
.
<EOS>
Iwill
not
be
pressed
to
assign
a
reason
for
this
determination
;
nor
willI
say
more
than
I
have
done
.
<EOS>
I
wish
him
to
be
wholly
uninfluenced
by
me

<EOS>
Neither
will
I
have
it
said
that
I
have
interfered
with
his
happiness

""And
<EOS>
yet
,
believe
me

it
will
be
both
said

so

<EOS>
Mrs.

,
"
Beware

<EOS>
"Abel
uttered
a
sharp
cry
and
walked
away
while
Trussell
looked
at
hissister
to
intimate
she
had
gone
too
far
.
<EOS>
She
instantly
arose
,
and
goingup
to
Abel
,
took
his
hand
,
nor
did
he
withdraw
it
from
her
.
<EOS>
"Pardon

me

she
said
,
"

from
what
I
know

his

that
a

<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
do
not
make
him
miserable
,
sister
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
is
afree
agent
,
and
can
marry
whom
he
pleases
,
without
my
consent
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
have
told
you
he
never
will
do
so
,
brother
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Hisfuture
happiness
or
misery
rests
with
you
.
<EOS>
""Sophia
<EOS>
,
I
will
not
endure
this
!
"
<EOS>
said
Abel
,
sternly
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
request
thesubject
may
never
be
mentioned
again
.
<EOS>
I
have
no
desire
to
wound
yourfeelings
,
but
the
truth
must
not
be
hidden
from
you
.
<EOS>
Since
his
arrivalin
town
,
Randulph
has
exhibited
such
a
turn
for
gaiety
and
dissipation
,
that
I
think
it
would
be
very
unwise
in
him
to
marry
at
all
--
at
least
,
at
present
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
he
can
not
marry
advantageously
,
"
interposed
Trussell
,
"
<EOS>
I
am
clearlyof
Abel
's
opinion
.
<EOS>
His
tastes
and
habits
are
rather
expensive
.
<EOS>
""Expensive
,
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
They
were
most
moderate
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
he
has
a
slight
taste
for
play
,
"
pursued
Trussell
;
"
and
isdecidedly
partial
to
society
and
amusement
.
<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
hurry
him
back
into
the
country
as
soon
as
he
is
able
to
move!"cried
Mrs.
Crew
,
greatly
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
you
'll
do
wisely
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
n't
think
he
'll
go
,
"
rejoined
Trussell
,
laughing
;
"
and
if
he
does
,
he'll
soon
find
his
way
back
again
.
<EOS>
He
is
too
fond
of
town
to
be
longaway
from
it
.
<EOS>
""Oh
!
<EOS>
how
changed
he
must
be
!
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"He
owes
it
all
to
his
uncle
Trussell
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
sharply
.
<EOS>
"Then
<EOS>
he
owes
me
a
great
deal
,
"
replied
Trussell
;
"
and
I
hope
he
wontforget
the
debt
.
<EOS>
I
think
the
plan
of
hurrying
him
into
the
country
quitewrong
.
<EOS>
If
you
wish
Hilda
to
make
a
deep
impression
upon
him
,
that
willbe
the
surest
way
to
accomplish
the
object
.
<EOS>
In
town
,
he
has
a
thousanddistractions
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
exactly
say
how
be
will
stand
with
Lady
Brabazonafter
this
duel
--
but
there
is
a
Kitty
Conway
,
and
he
is
sure
to
haveplenty
of
new
entanglements
.
<EOS>
""Brother
,
"
cried
Mrs
Crew--"you
<EOS>
only
furnish
me
with
additional
reasonsfor
desiring
to
take
him
away
.
<EOS>
""I
am
very
sorry
he
ever
came
,
"
said
Abel
;
"
it
has
disturbed
the
wholeof
my
arrangements
,
and
opened
old
wounds
,
which
,
though
not
closed
,
were
yet
not
painful
.
<EOS>
Even
Trussell
has
been
unsettled
by
it
.
<EOS>
""Not
<EOS>
in
the
least
,
sir
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
enjoyed
his
visitamazingly
;
and
should
belie
myself
confoundedly
if
I
said
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Iwish
<EOS>
I
could
prevail
upon
you
to
let
him
remain
here
a
few
monthslonger
,
and
give
him
another
hundred
or
so
--
and
then--""Plunge
him
back
again
into
poverty
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
cutting
him
short
.
<EOS>
"What
would
be
the
use
of
such
a
course
?
<EOS>
What
good
purpose
would
itanswer
?
<EOS>
He
has
apparently
no
wish
to
embark
in
any
profession
.
<EOS>
And
whyshould
I
furnish
him
with
the
means
of
continuing
his
career
ofdissipation
?
<EOS>
No
.
<EOS>
I
will
do
no
such
thing
.
<EOS>
""Will
<EOS>
you
see
how
he
goes
on
for
a
month
after
his
convalescence
?
<EOS>
"
askedTrussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Surely
,
that
is
no
great
length
of
time
to
allow
him
.
<EOS>
""I
will
promise
nothing
,
"
replied
Abel
.
"
<EOS>
And
now
,
brother
,
I
shall
beglad
to
be
left
alone
for
a
short
time
with
Sophia
.
<EOS>
""Willingly
,
sir
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
And
he
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Abel
then
took
a
chair
,
and
motioned
his
sister
to
seat
herself
besidehim
.
<EOS>
For
a
few
moments
,
he
continued
silent
,
as
if
summoning
upresolution
to
address
her
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
spoke
.
<EOS>
"You
have
alluded
to
past
times
,
Sophia
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
of
deepemotion
,
"
and
have
contrasted
my
position
with
that
of
your
son
,
but
youwell
know
they
are
widely
different
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
do
not
interrupt
me;--I
knowwhat
you
would
say
.
<EOS>
Randulph
has
personal
advantages
which
I
neverpossessed
,
and
which
are
sure
to
win
him
favour
in
the
eyes
of
his
sex
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
his
nature
does
not
resemble
mine
;
his
feelings
are
not
soconcentrated
;
nor
do
I
believe
he
could
love
so
deeply
.
<EOS>
The
love
Ientertained
for
Arabella
Clinton
was
not
the
growth
of
a
day
--
a
month
--
ayear
--
but
the
love
of
years
.
<EOS>
I
had
seen
her
opening
beauties
expand
--
hadacquainted
myself
with
her
mind
--
ascertained
her
disposition
,
hertemper
--
knew
all
her
feelings
,
and
persuaded
myself
that
she
requited
mylove
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
she
did
requite
it
,
brother
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
She
did
loveyou
.
<EOS>
""In
mercy
,
do
not
tell
me
so
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
,
becoming
as
pale
as
death
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Iwould
rather
think
she
hated
me
--
<EOS>
deceived
me;--but
loved
me!--thatbelief
is
only
wanting
to
make
me
thoroughly
<EOS>
wretched!""Calm
<EOS>
yourself
,
dear
brother
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
I
would
not
increaseyour
unhappiness
for
the
world
;
but
I
am
persuaded
that
the
examinationof
this
subject
,
which
,
from
unhappy
circumstances
,
we
have
neverhitherto
been
able
to
discuss
,
will
in
the
end
relieve
you
of
muchanxiety
.
<EOS>
""I
will
try
to
bear
it
in
that
hope
,
"
said
Abel
;
"
but
the
barbed
arrowis
too
firmly
and
too
deeply
planted
to
be
removed
.
<EOS>
You
will
onlylacerate
me
further
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
""I
will
not
be
intimidated
,
"
rejoined
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
begin
bytelling
you
that
it
is
your
own
fault
that
Arabella
Clinton
was
not
yourwife
.
<EOS>
You
have
alluded
to
the
deep
passion
you
entertained
for
her
,
andyour
doubts
of
her
affection
for
you
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
say
that
she
loved
youwith
equal
passion
,
because
you
were
not
a
person
to
inspire
suchardour
,
neither
was
she
one
to
feel
it
,
for
her
nature
<EOS>
was
frigid
.
<EOS>
Butshe
loved
you
well
enough
to
have
been
your
wife
;
and
what
is
more
,
shethoroughly
respected
you
;
and
therefore
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
youmight
have
been
happy
.
<EOS>
""Go
on
!
"
groaned
Abel
.
<EOS>
"You
will
forgive
me
,
if
I
speak
plainly
,
"
pursued
Mrs.
Crew
,
"
for
Imust
<EOS>
do
so
<EOS>
to
shew
you
where
you
erred
.
<EOS>
Rating
yourself
too
humbly
,
youpursued
,
as
I
conceive
,
a
most
unwise
and
dangerous
plan
in
order
totest
the
sincerity
of
your
mistress
's
attachment
.
<EOS>
Fearful
she
mightaccept
you
on
the
score
of
your
wealth
,
you
represented
yourself
as
invery
moderate
circumstances
;
and
while
full
of
tenderness
and
affection
,
adopted
not
unfrequently
a
harsh
and
forbidding
manner
towards
her
.
<EOS>
""True
,
true
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
.
<EOS>
"You
were
both
the
victims
of
error
,
"
continued
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Deceived
byyour
manner
,
she
thought
you
had
conceived
a
dislike
for
her
,
and
stroveto
wean
herself
from
all
regard
for
you
;
while
her
efforts
made
youbelieve
you
were
indifferent
to
her
.
<EOS>
All
,
however
,
might
have
comeright
,
but
for
the
fatal
mistake
of
deluding
her
as
to
yourcircumstances
.
<EOS>
With
her
,
wealth
was
of
little
importance
,
and
she
wouldhave
married
you
as
readily
poor
as
rich
;
but
with
her
father
it
wasotherwise
.
<EOS>
""Her
<EOS>
father
was
aware
of
my
circumstances
,
"
said
Abel
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
<EOS>
"He
was
so
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
,
"
but
it
was
his
business
to
concealthem
;
for
Arabella
had
a
richer
suitor
whom
he
preferred
.
<EOS>
Captivated
byher
beauty
,
Mr.
Scarve
proposed
to
her
,
and
his
suit
was
seconded
by
herfather
,
who
told
her
that
you
were
needy
,
sour
tempered
,
and
indifferentto
her
.
<EOS>
Doubly
deceived
,
she
hesitated
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
seeking
anexplanation
,
you
avoided
it
,
and
retired
to
make
way
for
your
rival
.
<EOS>
""I
did
so
,
because
I
thought
he
was
preferred
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Several
<EOS>
slight
circumstances
I
know
conspired
to
confirm
you
in
youropinion
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
,
"
but
they
were
all
devised
by
Mr.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
Afalse
construction
was
put
upon
you
absence
,
and
Arabella
was
induced
togive
her
hand
to
Mr.
Scarve
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
was
<EOS>
I
not
told
all
this
at
the
time
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
I
was
not
aware
of
it
myself
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
You
mayremember
that
this
occurred
during
the
period
of
my
engagement
to
mypoor
husband
,
who
was
an
old
and
intimate
friend
of
Mr.
Scarve
's
,
andconsequently
,
not
unnaturally
disliked
by
you
.
<EOS>
This
produced
a
coolnessbetween
you
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
to
be
plain
with
you
,
I
did
not
understand
,
norestimate
your
character
then
as
thoroughly
as
I
do
now
.
<EOS>
I
thought
youcold
and
repelling
,
and
never
gave
you
credit
for
the
depth
of
feelingyou
have
since
exhibited
.
<EOS>
Neither
had
Mr.
Scarve
displayed
himself
inhis
true
colors
then
.
<EOS>
At
that
time
he
had
a
good
personal
appearance
,
kept
a
tolerable
establishment
,
and
I
really
thought
Arabella
was
betteroff
than
if
she
married
you
.
<EOS>
I
was
angry
,
too
,
that
you
had
attempted
totest
her
affections
by
misrepresenting
your
circumstances
,
and
thoughtyou
rightly
served
in
losing
her
.
<EOS>
Hence
arose
the
misunderstandingbetween
us
,
which
separated
us
to
the
present
period
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
how
do
you
know
that
Arabella
's
sentiments
towards
me
were
what
youdescribe
?
"
asked
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
have
it
under
her
own
hand
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
She
wrote
to
me
afull
explanation
of
all
the
circumstances
connected
with
this
part
ofher
life
,
stating
how
sincerely
she
had
loved
you
,
and
how
much
shelamented
that
a
mistake
had
separated
her
from
you
.
<EOS>
From
her
letters
,
and
from
other
information
afforded
me
by
my
husband
,
I
have
beenenabled
to
understand
the
whole
case
.
<EOS>
You
have
been
the
victims
ofmisunderstanding
.
<EOS>
But
console
yourself
.
<EOS>
A
thousandth
part
of
thesuffering
you
have
undergone
would
atone
for
a
more
grievous
error
thanyou
have
committed
.
<EOS>
Console
yourself
<EOS>
,
I
say
.
<EOS>
You
were
beloved
byArabella
Clinton
,
and
to
the
last
she
retained
the
sincerest
regard
foryou
.
<EOS>
""That
is
indeed
a
consolation
to
me
,
"
said
Abel
,
melting
into
tears
.
<EOS>
"
Iam
not
ashamed
to
indulge
this
weakness
in
your
presence
,
sister
,
"
headded
,
in
a
broken
voice
.
<EOS>
"These
<EOS>
tears
will
do
you
good
,
"
she
replied
,
"
and
I
pray
you
to
indulgethem
freely
.
<EOS>
The
past
will
not
henceforth
be
so
painful
to
contemplate
.
<EOS>
If
I
mistake
not
,
your
bitterest
pang
was
the
idea
that
you
had
neverbeen
loved
.
<EOS>
""It
was
!
"
<EOS>
gasped
Abel
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
that
has
now
been
removed
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
Here
are
Arabella'sletters
,
"
she
added
,
giving
him
a
small
packet
.
<EOS>
"
You
will
see
from
themhow
you
have
misunderstood
her

<EOS>
"Abel
took
them
,
glanced
at
the
superscription
with
a
shudder
,
and
placedthem
in
his
breast
.
<EOS>
"I
will
read
them

"
he
said
,
"
but
not
now

<EOS>
""Does
<EOS>
Hilda
Scarve
resemble
her
mother
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Crew
,
after
a
pause
.
<EOS>
"She
is
like
her
,
but
handsomer
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
seen
her
upontwo
occasions
lately
,
and
she
appears
a
very
amiable
girl
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
what
objection
can
there
be
to
an
union
between
her
and
Randulph?"asked
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"I
have
said
I
will
not
be
pressed
on
that
head
,
sister
,
"
rejoined
Abel
,
sternly
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
an
objection
--
a
strong
objection

<EOS>
What
it
is
<EOS>
you
shallknow
at

<EOS>
""Heaven

the
victimsof

Mrs.

Mr.

""It

Mrs.

he

""There

asked

"None

returned
Mrs.

<EOS>
"I'm

brightening
up

""Is

asked

<EOS>
"Why

""Quite

replied
Mrs.

I

at

""I

said
Mrs.

<EOS>
"It
is
idle

upon

said
Abel
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"
Go
and
get
something

Jacob

tell
your

will
be
quite
himself
in
a

""In

so

thought
Jacob

as
heleft
the
room

and
marched
off
to
the
butler

pantry
to
Mr.

Soon
after

Abel
quitted

While

CHAPTER

THE
INTERVIEW
BETWEEN
CORDWELL

AND

MRS

<EOS>
CREW.Mrs
.
<EOS>
Crew
,
though
a
good
deal
surprised
and
startled
,
maintained
hercomposure
sufficiently
well
not
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
butler
,
whohaving
placed
a
chair
for
the
visitor
,
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
"I
have
called
to
inquire
after
your
son
,
madam
,
"
commenced
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Iwas
present
at
the
affair
yesterday
,
and
can
confirm
what
you
have
nodoubt
heard
from
your
brother
,
that
he
conducted
himself
admirablythroughout
it
.
<EOS>
""My
<EOS>
son
,
I
am
happy
in
being
able
to
state
,
is
rapidly
recovering,"replied
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crew
;
"
and
having
satisfied
you
on
this
point
,
sir
,
I
mustentreat
you
to
abridge
your
visit
as
much
as
possible
.
<EOS>
I
would
not
,
onany
account
,
that
my
brother
Abel
should
meet
you
here
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
fear
of
that
,
madam
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Firebras
:
"
<EOS>
I
watched
him
goforth
before
I
ventured
to
make
my
call
.
<EOS>
But
time
is
precious
,
and
Iwill
come
to
the
object
of
my
visit
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
you
to
tell
youhow
much
captivated
your
son
<EOS>
was
with
Mr.
Scarve
's
fair
daughter
Hilda
.
<EOS>
A
slight
act
of
imprudence
on
his
part
for
some
time
alienated
the
younglady
's
regard
;
but
he
set
himself
right
with
her
at
Ranelagh
,
and
atVauxhall
made
rapid
progress
in
her
affections
.
<EOS>
I
was
present
when
theresult
of
the
duel
was
communicated
to
her
yesterday
,
and
if
I
hadentertained
any
previous
doubt
as
to
the
extent
of
Randulph
's
hold
uponher
heart
,
her
conduct
then
would
have
removed
it
.
<EOS>
She
was
takenfainting
from
the
room
.
<EOS>
""Poor
girl
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Crew--"I
am
sorry
for
her
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
sorry
?
"
<EOS>
rejoined
Firebras
;
"
Randulph
will
make
her
an
excellenthusband
.
<EOS>
""But
they
will
never
be
united
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
,
sighing
deeply
.
<EOS>
"It
will
be
his
own
fault
if
they
are
not
,
"
observed
Firebras
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"How
<EOS>
so
?
"
cried
Mrs.
Crew
;
"
both
his
uncle
and
her
father
are
againstthe
match
.
<EOS>
""That
<EOS>
I
well
know
,
"
replied
Firebras
;
"
but
both
might
be
brought
toassent
to
it
.
<EOS>
""You
are
trifling
with
me
,
"
said
the
lady
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
you
had
known
me
better
,
Mrs.
Crew
,
than
to
suppose
mecapable
of
trifling
on
a
serious
subject
,
"
rejoined
Firebras
,
almoststernly
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
make
good
my
words
.
<EOS>
Of
Mr.
Scarve
's
consent
I
am
sure
.
<EOS>
""He
must
have
altered
his
mind
,
then
,
completely
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
;
"
forI
have
been
told
that
he
intended
her
for
his
nephew
,
and
forbadeRandulph
his
house
.
<EOS>
""He
will
consent
,
if
I
require
it
,
"
said
Firebras
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
amaze
me
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Mrs.
Crew
;
"
but
my
brother
has
within
thesefew
minutes
refused
to
give
his
consent
,
and
Randulph
can
not
marrywithout
it
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
can
not
he
?
<EOS>
"
replied
Firebras
smiling
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
always
necessaryto
ask
an
uncle
's
consent
in
these
cases
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
Randulph
hasconsiderable
expectations
from
your
brother
,
it
would
be
better
not
tooffend
him
.
<EOS>
I
do
not
despair
of
winning
him
over
.
<EOS>
""You
will
accomplish
a
miracle
if
you
do
so
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
will
accomplish
it
,
and
more
,
provided
Randulph
will
join
ourparty
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
refused
your
former
overtures
,
did
he
not
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"He
<EOS>
did
,
"
replied
Firebras
;
"
but
I
should
have
succeeded
with
him
if
ithad
not
been
for
the
interference
of
your
brother
Abel
.
<EOS>
""I
am
rejoiced
to
hear
it
.
<EOS>
"
cried
Mrs.
Crew
.
"How
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Firebras
,
"
are
you
no
longer
faithful
to
our
cause?""As
faithful
as
ever
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
;
"
but
I
would
rather
<EOS>
my
sondied
than
forfeited
his
honour
--
<EOS>
and
he
must
forfeit
it
,
if
he
joins
usin
any
other
way
than
on
conviction
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
it
is
not
necessary
to
look
at
the
matter
so
nicely
,
"
repliedFirebras
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
We
must
make
proselytes
the
best
way
we
can
.
<EOS>
Randulph
will
be
useful
to
us
on
the
approaching
outbreak
,
and
I
amtherefore
anxious
to
secure
him
.
<EOS>
He
is
precisely
the
person
I
want
toattend
upon
the
prince
--
and
have
him
I
will
.
<EOS>
""You
are
very
peremptory
,
sir
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"You
accused
me
of
trifling
with
you
just
now
,
madam
,
"
<EOS>
pursued
<EOS>
Firebras,"but
<EOS>
I
will
shew
you
I
am
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
Your
son
's
whole
destiny
is
in
myhands
;
and
it
depends
altogether
on
me
whether
his
future
course
isbrilliant
,
successful
,
and
happy
,
or
the
reverse
.
<EOS>
Not
only
can
I
we
<EOS>
d
himto
the
object
of
his
affections
--
<EOS>
not
only
can
I
procure
him
a
handsomedower
from
her
father
--
not
only
can
I
secure
the
consent
of
hisuncle
--
but
I
can
restore
to
him
the
estates
which
he
has
given
up
to
hisfather
's
creditors
,
and
place
him
in
the
position
he
is
entitled
tooccupy
.
<EOS>
All
this
I
can
,
and
will
do
.
<EOS>
""Provided
<EOS>
he
joins
you
?
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"Of
course
,
"
replied
Firebras--"of
course
.
<EOS>
""Then
,
I
fear
he
will
remain
in
his
present
condition
,
"
sighed
Mrs
.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
look
at
the
other
side
of
the
case
,
"
pursued
Firebras
,
sternly:"this
is
not
a
matter
on
which
to
be
scrupulous
,
and
I
am
determined
tocarry
my
point
.
<EOS>
If
Randulph
refuses
to
join
me
,
he
loses
Hilda
--
losesher
dower
--
loses
his
uncle
's
fortune
--
and
his
own
.
<EOS>
Without
me
,
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
will
never
give
him
his
daughter
;
and
without
me
he
will
neverrecover
his
property
.
<EOS>
Now
,
mark
me
,
madam
,
for
I
know
your
son
betterthan
you
do
.
<EOS>
He
is
a
fine
spirited
young
man
,
and
endowed
with
excellentqualities
;
but
he
has
essentially
the
habits
and
feelings
of
agentleman
,
and
your
brother
Trussell
has
taken
care
to
inoculate
himwith
his
own
tastes
and
propensities
.
<EOS>
He
will
never
be
content
with
thequiet
life
he
has
hitherto
led
;
but
,
tormented
by
his
love
for
Hilda
,
and
the
sense
of
what
he
has
lost
,
will
be
driven
to
some
desperatecourse
.
<EOS>
""He
may
yet
marry
her
,
though
without
her
father
's
consent
,
"
said
Mrs
.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
marry
to
beggary
,
"
rejoined
Firebras
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
.
<EOS>
"
I
donot
wish
to
hold
out
threats
--
and
what
I
say
is
said
only
to
shew
mypower
.
<EOS>
He
never
shall
marry
Hilda
Scarve
,
nor
shall
he
ever
enjoy
hisown
again
,
unless
he
joins
the
Jacobite
cause
.
<EOS>
I
can
prevent
both
,
and
Iwill
prevent
them
.
<EOS>
His
decision
must
be
made
quickly
,
for
he
is
wanted
.
<EOS>
Within
a
month
from
this
time
he
must
be
mine
,
or
all
will
be
lost
tohim
.
<EOS>
As
a
prudent
and
affectionate
mother
--
as
a
well
-
wisher
to
ourcause
--
I
look
to
you
,
madam
,
to
use
all
your
influence
with
him
toproduce
this
result
.
<EOS>
""I
cannot
--
I
can
not
!
"
<EOS>
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Then
you
destroy
him
,
"
said
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
put
it
not
thus
,
"
she
rejoined
:
"
you
were
an
old
friend
of
hisfather
's
,
and
received
much
kindness
,
and
,
unless
I
mistake

pecuniaryassistance
from

<EOS>
Do
not
act
thus
cruelly
towards
the
son
of
your
oldfriend!""Cruelly
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Firebras
,
laughing
derisively
.
<EOS>
"
I
offer
him
afortune
and
the

of
his

and
you
call
it
cruelty
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!""But
at
the
price
of
his
honour

"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"His
honour
!
<EOS>
bah
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Firebras
,
contemptuously
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
to
stainhis
honour
in
quitting
the
cause
of
a
miserable
usurper
to
join
that
ofthe
rightful
claimant
of
the
throne
?
<EOS>
If
you
persist
in
such
a
notion
,
Ishall
begin
to
doubt
the
constancy
of
your
own
opinions

<EOS>
""I
should
be
glad
if
Randulph
would
voluntarily
embrace
our
cause
,
"
saidMrs

<EOS>
Crew
;
"
but
I
would
disown
him
if
he
were
base
enough
to
be
bought
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
I
have
placed
both
views
of
the
case
fairly
before
you
,
"
saidFirebras
,
rising--"weigh
over
what
I
have
said
,
and
decide
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
as
he
turned
to
depart
,
he
encountered
Abel
Beechcroft
,
who
hadentered
the
room
unobserved

<EOS>
"So

<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
without
losing
his
composure

"
we

<EOS>
You
have
heard
what
has
passed
between

<EOS>
Beechcroft?""Some
part
of
it

replied
Abel
;
"
and
I
applaud
my

conduct
asmuch
as
I
condemn
yours

You
have
stated

Firebras
;

Abel

<EOS>
"It
<EOS>
matters
not
what
I

"
returned
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
It
must
suffice
that
Ican
make

my
assertion

<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
you
are
not
a
creditor

"
rejoined
Abel
,
"
<EOS>
I
can
obtain
the

him
as
readily
as
yourself

<EOS>
""You
are
welcome
to
make
the
experiment

said
Firebras
,
with
a
slightlaugh
of
defiance
.
"
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crew
,
I
have
the
honour
to
wish
you
a
goodmorning
.
<EOS>
Though
my
plans
have
been
somewhat
precipitated
by
your
worthybrother
,
I
still
am
not
without
hopes
that
he
will
come
into
them
;
andat
all
events
,
his
presence
at
the
interview
will
save
you
the
necessityof
explanation

<EOS>
Your
son

I
trust
,
will
speedily
be
master
of
hisproperty

the
husband
of
Hilda

Abel

<EOS>
"Precisely

said
Firebras
,
laughing

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good

Mr.
Beechcroft

"And
<EOS>
turning
from

he
left
the

<EOS>
"That
is
a
daring
and
a
dangerous
man

"
said
Abel
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
"A
<EOS>
highly
dangerous
man

"
she
replied
;
"
and
Randulph
must
be
preservedfrom
him

<EOS>
""He
must

"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
make
it
my
immediate
business
toascertain
how
far
there
is
a
probability
of
his
being
correct
in
hisstatement
about
the

<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
that
I
chanced
to
comeback

<EOS>
Jukes
told
me
there
was
some
one

felt
sure

"CHAPTER

IV.--TREATS
OF
THE
MISER
'S
ILLNESS
;
AND
THE
DISCOVERY
OF
THE
MYSTERIOUSPACKET
<EOS>
BY
<EOS>
HILDA.Hilda
Scarve
had
soon
a
new
cause
of
anxiety
.
<EOS>
Not
only
was
she
uneasyabout
Randulph
,
whose
recovery
was
not
quite
so
rapid
as
had
beenanticipated
,
but
her
father
's
state
of
health
began
to
occasion
herconsiderable
alarm
.
<EOS>
While
walking
out
,
he
got
caught
in
the
rain
;
and
on
his
return
homethough
drenched
to
the
skin
,
refused
to
change
his
clothes
.
<EOS>
A
low
feverwas
the
consequence
;
and
holding
apothecary
's
stuff
,
as
he
termedphysic
,
in
abhorrence
,
he
would
take
nothing
to
carry
it
off
,
and
owingto
this
neglect
,
<EOS>
that
which
was
a
slight
matter
in
the
commencement
,
ended
in
becoming
a
serious
illness
.
<EOS>
One
day
,
in
spite
his
daughter
's
entreaties
,
he
would
go
forth
;
and
,
after
being
absent
for
a
few
hours
,
during
which
,
as
it
appeared
,
he
hadwalked
to
a
considerable
distance
<EOS>
,
he
returned
in
such
a
state
ofexhaustion
,
that
Hilda
was
quite
terrified
at
it
.
<EOS>
All
,
however
,
shecould
prevail
upon
him
to
take
<EOS>
was
a
small
basin
of
weak
water
gruel
,
but
without
even
a
teaspoonful
of
wine
or
brandy
in
it
.
<EOS>
The
next
morninghe
was
considerably
better
,
and
Hilda
thought
the
crisis
past
;
but
shewas
mistaken
,
and
so
was
her
father
;
for
,
fancying
that
the
exercise
ofthe
previous
day
had
done
him
good
<EOS>
,
he
went
out
again
,
walked
furtherthan
before
,
got
caught
a
second
time
in
the
rain
,
and
tearfullyincreased
the
fever
.
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
he
was
persuaded
to
take
off
his
wet
clothes
,
and
togo
to
bed
,
and
even
to
have
a
small
fire
lighted
in
his
chamber
,
wherenone
had
ever
before
been
lighted
in
his
time
.
<EOS>
Watching
this
operationwith
the
utmost
anxiety
;
he
called
to
Jacob
,
who
was
laying
the
fire
,
not
to
waste
the
wood
,
though
only
three
or
four
small
chips
were
used;next
blamed
him
for
putting
on
too
much
coal
;
and
lastly
,
forbade
him
tolight
it
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
however
,
ventured
to
disobey
his
orders
,
and
havingapplied
a
match
to
some
bits
of
paper
stuck
in
the
bars
,
quitted
theroom
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
the
miser
instantly
sprung
out
of
bed
,
andwithout
much
difficulty
extinguished
the
only
partially
-
kindled
fire
.
<EOS>
Shortly
afterwards
,
Hilda
came
into
the
room
,
and
finding
what
hadhappened
,
besought
him
to
let
the
fire
be
lighted
,
and
at
last
wrungfrom
him
a
most
reluctant
assent
.
<EOS>
But
again
another
accident
occurred
.
<EOS>
More
paper
was
lighted
,
the
wood
caught
,
and
began
to
crackle
in
thebars
.
<EOS>
The
chimney
,
however
,
smoked
,
and
Jacob
peeping
up
it
to
ascertainthe
cause
,
perceived
that
it
was
stopped
by
a
wisp
of
straw
.
<EOS>
Heimmediately
thrust
up
his
arm
,
pulled
down
the
obstacle
,
and
in
sodoing
,
dislodged
two
heavy
bags
,
which
fell
into
the
fire
with
arattling
noise
proclaiming
the
nature
of
their
contents
.
<EOS>
At
this
sound
,
the
miser
,
who
had
been
sinking
into
a
slumber
,
instantly
sprang
up
,
anduttering
a
wild
cry
,
ordered
both
his
daughter
and
Jacob
out
of
theroom
.
<EOS>
They
knew
him
too
well
to
disobey
,
and
as
soon
as
they
were
gone
,
he
got
out
of
bed
again
,
plucked
the
bags
from
the
fire
,
which
luckilyhad
not
burnt
the
sacking
,
and
,
locking
them
carefully
up
in
astrongbox
,
placed
the
key
under
his
pillow
.
<EOS>
But
the
idea
of
the
discovery
of
his
hoard
haunted
him
,
and
,
combinedwith
the
fever
,
prevented
the
possibility
of
slumber
.
<EOS>
He
tried
torecollect
the
different
places
where
he
had
hidden
money
,
and
,
unable
tocall
them
all
to
mind
,
grew
almost
distracted
.
<EOS>
Hilda
would
willinglyhave
sat
up
with
him
,
but
he
would
not
allow
her
;
neither
would
hepermit
Jacob
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
He
waited
till
he
thought
all
were
asleep
,
andthen
rising
,
wrapped
himself
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
and
proceeded
toexamine
several
nooks
and
crannies
in
the
room
,
in
which
he
had
placedsmall
sums
of
money
.
<EOS>
All
his
hoards
were
safe
,
except
one
.
<EOS>
He
had
putten
guineas
in
a
glove
about
two
months
before
,
and
fancied
he
hadhidden
it
behind
a
shutter
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
there
,
and
,
convinced
thatJacob
had
discovered
it
,
and
purloined
it
,
he
was
about
to
descend
andtax
him
with
the
robbery
,
when
he
all
at
once
recollected
that
he
hadplaced
the
glove
under
a
broken
plank
near
the
hearthstone
.
<EOS>
Heimmediately
took
up
the
board
,
and
there
,
sure
enough
,
was
the
losttreasure
.
<EOS>
Made
easy
by
this
discovery
,
he
restored
the
glove
to
its
place
,
andreturned
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
could
not
rest
.
<EOS>
An
idea
took
possession
ofhim
,
that
the
money
he
had
buried
in
the
cellar
was
gone
,
and
unable
toshake
off
the
notion
,
he
arose
,
and
habiting
himself
as
before
,
took
therushlight
that
burnt
by
his
bedside
,
and
,
with
trembling
but
cautioussteps
,
went
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
Arrived
at
the
cellar
,
he
set
down
therushlight
,
and
cast
an
almost
piteous
look
at
the
cask
,
beneath
which
hehad
buried
his
gold
,
as
if
seeking
to
know
whether
it
was
still
there
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
summoned
up
resolution
for
the
task
,
and
repairing
to
thecoal
-
hole
,
possessed
himself
of
the
shovel
,
and
commenced
digging
up
thebox
.
<EOS>
Anxiety
supplied
him
with
strength
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
,
hehad
got
out
the
box
,
opened
it
,
and
counted
the
money
bags
,
which
hefound
all
right
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
counted
the
gold
within
them
as
well
,
butneither
his
strength
nor
time
would
allow
him
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
While
thusemployed
,
he
formed
a
terrible
exemplification
of
the
effect
thatavarice
may
produce
upon
the
mind
.
<EOS>
There
he
worked
,
burning
with
feverin
a
damp
cellar
,
half
naked
,
for
he
had
taken
off
his
dressing
-
gown
toenable
him
to
ply
the
spade
with
greater
freedom;--there
<EOS>
he
worked
,
asif
life
and
death
were
in
his
efforts
,
and
almost
looked
,
<EOS>
such
was
hisghastly
appearance
,
like
a
corpse
digging
its
own
grave
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
fearful
sight
to
see
,
and
it
was
witnessed
by
one
upon
whom
itmade
a
lasting
and
forcible
impression
.
<EOS>
This
was
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
Hearinghim
go
down
stairs
,
she
had
followed
him
,
and
saw
what
he
was
about
,
butdid
not
dare
to
interrupt
him
,
apprehensive
of
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
he
had
got
out
the
box
,
and
examined
its
contents
,
she
hoped
allwas
over
,
and
,
proceeding
to
Jacob
's
room
,
roused
him
,
and
telling
himwhat
had
happened
,
bade
him
watch
his
master
,
and
then
retired
to
herown
chamber
.
<EOS>
Jacob
obeyed
,
and
having
seen
the
former
occurrence
,
was
at
no
loss
tocomprehend
what
was
now
happening
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
,
stationed
himself
atthe
door
,
and
saw
through
the
chink
,
for
it
was
left
ajar
,
that
themiser
was
filling
up
the
hole
,
and
restoring
the
place
to
its
formerappearance
.
<EOS>
It
was
wonderful
,
and
almost
incredible
,
to
see
how
thatfeeble
old
man
shaken
by
sickness
,
and
tottering
on
the
verge
of
thegrave
,
toiled
--
how
he
persevered
<EOS>
--
how
he
took
the
earth
out
of
thecask
--
how
he
filled
up
the
hole
<EOS>
--
how
he
restored
the
bricks
to
theirplaces
<EOS>
--
how
he
trod
them
down
with
his
naked
feet
.
<EOS>
Jacob
was
amazed
<EOS>
,
andalmost
felt
as
if
he
was
in
a
dream
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
suddenly
roused
to
fullconsciousness
as
the
miser
having
finished
his
task
,
leaned
upon
hisspade
to
rest
himself
,
but
being
completely
overcome
,
uttered
a
deepgroan
,
and
fell
with
his
face
upon
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Instantly
rushing
towards
him
,
Jacob
found
him
senseless
,
and
at
first
,
thought
him
dead
,
but
perceiving
some
symptoms
of
animation
about
him
,
he
lifted
him
up
in
his
arms
as
easily
as
if
he
had
been
a
child
,
andcarried
him
up
stairs
to
bed
.
<EOS>
He
then
informed
Hilda
what
had
happened
,
and
she
hastened
to
apply
such
restoratives
as
she
possessed
,
and
whichere
long
,
to
her
infinite
satisfaction
,
brought
him
back
toconsciousness
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
not
himself
for
some
hours
,
and
rambledincessantly
about
his
treasure
,
which
he
imagined
had
been
taken
fromhim
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
however
,
at
length
asserted
her
sway
,
and
he
droppedasleep
.
<EOS>
During
his
slumbers
,
Jacob
brought
the
chest
up
stairs
with
themoney
-
bags
in
it
,
and
placed
it
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
.
<EOS>
The
miser
did
not
wake
till
late
in
the
following
morning
,
and
he
wasthen
very
faint
and
light
-
headed
.
<EOS>
He
swallowed
a
basin
of
strong
broth
,
prepared
for
him
by
his
daughter
,
with
great
greediness
,
for
he
was
asmuch
exhausted
by
want
of
food
as
from
any
other
cause
,
and
in
thecourse
of
a
few
hours
gained
strength
considerably
.
<EOS>
As
he
got
better
,
his
head
cleared
,
and
he
began
to
recollect
something
of
the
events
ofthe
previous
night
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
thought
he
must
have
dreamt
of
diggingup
his
treasure
;
but
by
degrees
becoming
satisfied
that
he
had
reallydone
so
,
he
grew
exceedingly
uneasy
,
and
desired
to
know
how
he
had
beenput
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Hilda
then
told
him
,
and
shewed
him
where
the
chest
was
placed
,
assuringhim
<EOS>
all
was
safe
.
<EOS>
Still
he
was
not
wholly
satisfied
,
and
later
in
theday
determined
,
in
spite
of
all
dissuasions
to
the
contrary
,
to
get
up
.
<EOS>
Left
to
himself
,
he
locked
the
door
,
and
examined
the
bags
,
which
wereall
tied
in
a
peculiar
manner
,
and
sealed
,
and
their
appearancesatisfied
him
they
had
not
been
opened
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
long
up
,
when
hefelt
so
dreadfully
ill
,
that
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
he
beganto
think
his
end
approaching
.
<EOS>
Falling
back
in
his
chair
,
he
shook
aswith
an
ague
,
while
cold
perspiration
burst
from
every
pore
.
<EOS>
The
fit
,
however
,
passed
off
,
and
he
made
an
effort
to
crawl
to
the
door
,
andcall
Jacob
.
<EOS>
The
latter
instantly
answered
the
summons
,
and
looked
sounmistakeably
alarmed
at
his
master
's
appearance
,
that
the
other
couldnot
but
notice
it
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
think
me
very
ill
,
Jacob
?
"
said
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
Do
n't
be
afraid
offrightening
me
,
speak
the
truth,--I
know
you
do
.
<EOS>
""Why
,
yes
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
;
"
you
do
n't
look
well
,
certainly
.
<EOS>
If
I
wasyou
,
and
<EOS>
I
'd
any
affairs
to
arrange
,
I
'd
settle
'em
quickly
,
for
fear
<EOS>
ofaccident,--that
's
all
.
<EOS>
""I
understand
,
"
replied
the
miser
,
with
a
ghastly
grin
;
"
but
I
'm
notgoing
to
die
just
yet
,
Jacob,--not
just
yet,--don't
think
it
.
<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
sure
I
hope
not
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
for
though
we
have
n't
agreed
overand
above
well
of
late
<EOS>
,
I
should
be
sorry
to
lose
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
turned
away
,
and
crept
back
to
his
chair
,
sinking
into
itexhausted
by
the
effort
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
"I
want
you
to
go
to
Grey
's
Inn
,
Jacob
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
,
"
to
tellMr
.
<EOS>
Diggs
to
come
to
me
.
<EOS>
""What
,
to
make
your
will
?
"
rejoined
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Well
,
I
think
you
're
rightthere
.
<EOS>
No
harm
in
bein
'
on
the
safe
side
.
<EOS>
""Never
<EOS>
mind
what
I
want
him
for
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
;
"
do
as
I
bid
you
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
you

said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
A

a
serious

I

an

""Don't

cried
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"I
do

like

Diggs
,
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Could
n't
I
make
a
will
foryou
.
<EOS>
A
few
words
would
do
it
--
I
leave
all
my
property
and
possessions
,
whatsoever
and
wheresomdever
,
to
my
lawfully
begotten
daughter
,
HildaScarve.--That'll
be
quite
enough
,
and
far
better
than
any
will
Mr

<EOS>
Digges'll
make
for
you
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
it
'll
cost
you
nothin
.
<EOS>
""This
fellow
will
kill
me
!
"
groaned
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
Do
go
,
Jacob
,
"
he
added
,
imploringly
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
ca
n't
resist
that
,
"
said
Jacob
;
"
but
as
you
hope
to
be
forgivenhereafter
,
do
n't
act
unjustly
by
your
daughter
.
<EOS>
""If
you
continue
faithful
to
me
to
the
last
I
'll
leave
you
a
handsomelegacy
,
Jacob
,
"
said
the
miser
;
"
a
handsome
legacy
--
but
not
a
farthingif
you
disobey
me
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
want
a
legacy
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
'd
rather
not
have
it
.
<EOS>
Butdon't
you
forget
your
wife
's
sister
,
poor
Mrs.
Clinton
.
<EOS>
You
've
used
herhardly
this
many
a
year
.
<EOS>
Make
it
up
to
her
now
.
<EOS>
""I
must
look
ill
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
groaned
the
miser
,
"
since
the
rascal
dares
totalk
to
me
thus
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go
or
not
?
"
<EOS>
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
yes
!
<EOS>
I
'll
go
,
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Shall
I
send
your
daughter
to
you
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
receiving
a
faint
reply
in
the
affirmative
,
he
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
About
an
hour
after
this
,
he
returned
with
Diggs
,
who
was
closeted
withthe
miser
for
a
long
time
.
<EOS>
Jacob
knew
that
some
writing
must
be
goingforward
,
for
he
was
ordered
to
take
pen
and
ink
up
stairs
;
and
he
wouldfain
have
played
the
spy
,
but
he
could
not
do
so
without
being
detected
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
was
summoned
by
Diggs
,
who
desired
him
to
call
a
coach
.
<EOS>
Hewas
not
long
in
meeting
with
one
;
and
on
informing
the
attorney
that
itwas
ready
for
him
,
he
was
almost
struck
dum
with
astonishment
,
by
anorder
from
the
latter
to
take
down
the
chest
containing
the
money
bags
,
and
place
it
in
the
vehicle
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
send
that
chest
away
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
said
to
his
master
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
that
chest
--
that
identical
chest
,
my
good
fellow
,
"
said
theattorney
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
I
must
have
the
order
from
master
's
own
lips
,
or
I
wo
n't
obey
it,"said
Jacob
,
doggedly
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
be
pleased
,
<EOS>
sir
,
to
tell
your
servant
what
he
is
to
do
?
<EOS>
"
saidDiggs
,
impatiently
.
<EOS>
"Take
away
the
chest
,
"
said
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"What
this
with
the
money
in
it
--
this
here
?
<EOS>
"
asked
Jacob
,
giving
it
asounding
knock
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
if
I
must
,
I
must
,
"
said
Jacob
,
shouldering
the
chest
;
"
but
itwould
have
been
safer
in
the
cellar
than
where
it
's
a
-
goin
'
to
.
<EOS>
"He
had
scarcely
placed
his
burthen
in
the
coach
when
Diggs
followed
him
,
and
jumping
into
the
vehicle
,
ordered
him
,
with
a
triumphant
glance
toshut
the
door
,
and
bid
the
coachman
drive
to
his
chambers
.
<EOS>
"Gray
's
Inn
,
coachee
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
,
as
he
complied
;
"
and
may
you
breakyour
fare
's
neck
as
you
go
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
lower
tone
.
<EOS>
His
mind
lightened
,
apparently
,
by
what
had
taken
place
,
Mr.
Scarveremained
perfectly
quiet
during
the
rest
of
the
day
,
and
retired
earlyto
rest
;
but
he
passed
another
sleepless
night
,
and
was
seized
with
anew
panic
about
his
money
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
finding
himself
unable
to
godown
stairs
,
he
ordered
Jacob
to
bring
up
all
his
boxes
,
and
to
placethem
near
him
.
<EOS>
His
fever
increasing
,
and
assuming
somewhat
of
thecharacter
of
an
ague
,
he
consented
to
have
a
small
fire
kept
upconstantly
in
his
bedroom
,
and
set
his
chair
close
beside
it
.
<EOS>
Inaddition
to
his
dressing
-
gown
,
he
wrapped
an
old
blanket
over
hisshoulders
,
and
tried
to
keep
his
lower
limbs
warm
by
clothing
them
in
acouple
of
worsted
hose
.
<EOS>
His
bed
being
totally
destitute
of
hangings
,
hehad
a
sheet
hung
up
against
the
lower
end
of
it
to
keep
off
the
blaze
ofthe
fire
which
he
fancied
disturbed
him
during
the
night
.
<EOS>
These
slightcomforts
were
all
he
permitted
himself
,
and
he
remained
as
inflexible
asever
on
the
score
of
medicine
,
and
medical
advice
.
<EOS>
"A
doctor
can
do
no
good
,
"
he
said
to
Jacob
,
who
urged
him
to
send
forone
:
"
if
abstinence
wo
nt
cure
a
man
,
no
physic
will
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
perhaps
you
're
right
sir
,
"
said
Jacob
;
"
but
I
wish
you
'd
thinkless
o
'
your
worldly
affairs
,
and
more
o
'
your
sperretual
ones
.
<EOS>
Look
atthat
pictur
'
over
your
chimney
-
piece
,
and
see
how
Death
is
takin
'
awaythe
covetous
man
's
treasures
before
his
very
eyes
.
<EOS>
It
might
be
intendedas
a
warnin
'
to
you
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
picture
,
alluded
to
by
Jacob
,
was
a
copy
of
one
of
Holbein
's
designsof
<EOS>
the
Dance
of
Death
suspended
over
the
chimney
-
piece
,
and
with
thescriptural
motto
underneath
it--'Stulte
,
hac
nocte
repetunt
animum
tuam
:
et
<EOS>
quae
parasti
cujus
<EOS>
erunt?'--did
seem
to
have
a
fearful
and
,
solemnapplication
to
the
present
conjuncture
.
<EOS>
The
miser
shuddered
as
he
lookedat
it
,
but
he
would
not
acknowledge
the
justice
of
the
porter
's
remark
.
<EOS>
Of
late
,
he
had
begun
to
entertain
a
dislike
to
Jacob
,
and
wouldscarcely
suffer
him
to
come
near
him
.
<EOS>
Having
seen
him
,
when
opening
oneof
the
boxes
,
take
up
an
old
stocking
-
foot
in
which
a
few
pieces
ofsilver
were
tied
up
,
he
took
it
into
his
head
that
he
designed
to
robhim
;
and
his
fears
being
magnified
by
his
perturbed
imagination
,
he
soonpersuaded
himself
that
he
also
intended
to
murder
him
.
<EOS>
To
prevent
anysuch
design
,
he
placed
a
loaded
pistol
on
the
chimney
-
piece
near
him
,
and
hung
a
drawn
sword
on
a
peg
,
so
as
to
be
within
reach
in
case
ofneed
.
<EOS>
These
weapons
he
carried
with
him
to
his
bed
-
side
at
night
.
<EOS>
But
he
grew
daily
worse
and
worse
,
and
his
faculties
became
more
andmore
enfeebled
.
<EOS>
He
rambled
about
the
house
at
night
almost
in
a
state
ofsomnambulism
,
muttering
strange
things
about
his
treasure
,
andfrequently
visiting
the
cellar
where
he
had
buried
the
chest
,
unconscious
that
it
was
gone
.
<EOS>
At
such
times
,
Jacob
constantly
followed
him
to
prevent
him
from
doinghimself
a
mischief
,
but
took
care
not
to
be
seen
.
<EOS>
His
groans
andlamentations
were
pitiful
to
hear
,
for
he
had
begun
to
fancy
himself
aruined
man
,
and
not
even
the
sight
of
his
money
could
assure
him
to
thecontrary
.
<EOS>
It
was
vain
to
reason
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
distressing
idea
was
too
stronglyimpressed
upon
his
mind
to
be
removed
.
<EOS>
His
next
whim
was
to
have
his
boxes
opened
by
Hilda
to
whom
he
hadentrusted
his
keys
,
and
he
insisted
upon
certain
deeds
and
papers
beingread
to
him
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
only
very
imperfectly
comprehended
.
<EOS>
One
night
,
when
seated
by
the
fire
-
side
wrapped
in
his
blanket
,
and
withhis
feet
on
a
straw
hassock
,
he
desired
his
daughter
to
read
him
somemore
papers
.
<EOS>
The
fire
burnt
as
cheerily
as
it
could
in
the
starvelinggrate
,
and
Hilda
insisting
upon
having
two
candles
to
read
by
,
there
wasmore
light
than
usual
.
<EOS>
Having
got
through
several
mortgages
,
leases
,
andbonds
,
to
the
innumerable
clauses
of
which
he
listened
in
his
usualapathetic
manner
;
he
suddenly
turned
round
to
her
,
and
pointing
to
thestrong
-
box
which
formerly
stood
under
his
table
in
the
room
down
-
stairs
,
signed
to
her
to
open
it
.
<EOS>
Well
aware
that
this
box
contained
his
mostprivate
papers
<EOS>
,
Hilda
had
hitherto
avoided
meddling
with
it
,
but
thusinjoined
,
she
no
longer
hesitated
.
<EOS>
Placing
it
on
the
table
,
therefore
,
she
took
the
large
bunch
of
keys
,
and
soon
finding
the
right
one
,
unlocked
it
.
<EOS>
"Is
<EOS>
there
anything
in
particular
you
wish
me
to
read
,
dear
father
?
"
<EOS>
shesaid
,
taking
out
some
papers
tied
together
with
red
tape
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
is
abond
for
two
thousand
pounds
from
George
Delahay
Villiers
,
Esquire;another
from
Lady
Brabazon
;
and
another
from
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
.
<EOS>
Shall
Iread
any
of
them?"The
miser
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
"Here
are
several
bills
,
"
she
continued
,
taking
up
a
roll
of
smallerpapers--"and
another
bundle
of
mortgages
,
will
you
hear
any
of
them?"The
miser
shook
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
movement
was
almost
mechanical
with
him
.
<EOS>
"Then
I
will
go
on
,
"
pursued
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
what
is
this
letter
with
theblack
seal
!
<EOS>
Shall
I
read
it?"The
miser
made
no
reply
.
<EOS>
He
was
gazing
listlessly
into
the
fire
,
andwatching
the
wreaths
of
smoke
ascend
the
chimney
with
childish
delight
.
<EOS>
Hilda
,
therefore
opened
the
letter
,
and
found
a
small
memorandumenclosed
in
it
,
which
she
placed
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Trembling
with
emotion
,
she
then
began
to
read
aloud
the
following
lines:--"Old
and
valued
Friend,--If
<EOS>
this
should
ever
meet
your
eye
<EOS>
,
I
shall
havebeen
a
year
in
my
grave
,
for
in
accordance
with
our
agreement
,
it
willnot
be
delivered
to
you
until
the
expiration
of
that
time
after
mydeath
.
<EOS>
The
agreement
,
I
need
not
remind
you
,
was
so
formed
,
that
in
casewe
should
both
die
within
the
year
,
the
contract
entered
into
by
usrespecting
the
marriage
of
our
children
should
be
null
and
void
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
Hilda
was
startled
by
a
sharp
cry
from
her
father
,
and
looking
up
<EOS>
,
she
saw
that
he
was
staring
wildly
and
inquiringly
at
her
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
are
you
reading
?
"
he
asked
.
<EOS>
"The
letter
delivered
to
you
by
Randulph
Crew
,
"
she
replied;--"theletter
from
his
father
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
business
have
you
to
read
it
?
"
he
cried
.
<EOS>
"
Who
gave
you
leaveto
do
so?""Having
gone
so
far
,
I
shall
go
on
,
"
rejoined
Hilda
;
and
she
resumed
<EOS>
herreading:--"I
now
call
upon
you
to
fulfil
your
share
of
the
contract
,
andto
give
your
daughter
to
my
son

<EOS>
When
we
entered
into
the
engagement
,
Iwas
supposed
to
be
the
richer
of
the
two
;
but
I
am
now
sadly
reduced
,
and
if
my
son
fulfils
his
word
,
and
gives
up
the
estates
to
pay
mycreditors
,
he
will
have
little
or
nothing
.
<EOS>
""He
has
nothing

nothing

<EOS>
cried
the
miser
;
"
I
will
never
give

<EOS>
never!""But
<EOS>
under
whatever
circumstances

Hilda

continuing
the
letter
,
"

<EOS>
""I

<EOS>
cried
the
miser
;
"
it
is
false

false!""I

Hilda
,
still
reading

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
here
is
the
memorandum

"
she
added
,
taking
up
the
smaller
piece
ofpaper,--"It

<EOS>
""It

shrieked
the

.
<EOS>
"The

said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"Father

<EOS>
""I

replied
the

it
is
all
a

<EOS>
Giveme

I
may
burn
them

<EOS>
Give
them
to
me
directly!"And
getting
up
,
he
staggered
toward
her
,
and
snatched
the
letter
andmemorandum
from
her
,
with
the
intention
of
throwing
them
into
the
fire
.
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
do
so
,
the
door
opened
,
and
admitted
AbelBeechcroft
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
you
want
,
sir
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
miser
,
fearfully
regarding
him
,
andletting
the
papers
which
he
had
crushed
in
his
grasp
drop
upon
thefloor

<EOS>
"I

replied
Abel

Abel

"To

Scarve

Beechcroft

,
"
said
Hilda
;
"
but
there
is
one
thing
I
would
mention--""Not
a
word
about
the
letter
,
or
the
contract
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
miser
,
withsudden
fury
;
"
not
a
word
,
or
I
will
launch
my
curse
against
you
--
afather
's
curse
--
beware
how
you
incur
<EOS>
it!""What
is
this
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Abel
Beechcroft
,
in
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
<EOS>
,
"
cried
the
miser--"it
<EOS>
is
a
matter
between
me
and
my
daughter
.
<EOS>
Get
you
gone
.
<EOS>
You
have
no
business
here
.
<EOS>
I
can
die
without
yourforgiveness
.
<EOS>
""Father
!
"
exclaimed
Hilda
,
"
I
have
a
duty
to
others
as
well
as
to
you
.
<EOS>
Another
opportunity
may
not
occur
.
<EOS>
I
must
tell
Mr.
Beechcroft
what
Ihave
discovered
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
shook
his
hands
at
her
in
impotent
fury
,
and
attempted
topronounce
the
curse
;
but
his
utterance
failed
him
and
with
a
halfarticulate
cry
,
he
fell
senseless
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Hilda
's
cries
instantly
brought
Jacob
to
the
room
,
and
the
miser
waslaid
upon
his
bed
,
where
restoratives
were
successfully
employed
.
<EOS>
Inexpressibly
shocked
and
alarmed
by
what
he
had
witnessed
,
AbelBeechcroft
took
his
leave
and
Hilda
having
picked
up
the
letter
andmemorandum
,
and
carefully
straightened
them
,
put
them
both
into
a
placeof
security

A
NOTE
FROM
KITTY
CONWAY
;
AND
IS
ASSAULTED
BYPHILIP
FREWIN
AND
HIS
MYRMIDONS
ON
HIS
WAY
TO
SUP
WITH
HER.Accounts
of
Mr.
Scarve
's
state
of
health
had
been
conveyed
to
Mrs.
Crewby
Jacob
,
who
unhesitatingly
expressed
his
conviction
that
the
attackwould
terminate
fatally
.
<EOS>
"He
may
linger
for
some
time
,
"
said
Jacob
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
'm
certain
he
'll
neverbe
himself
again
.
<EOS>
"This
intelligence
produced
a
visible
effect
on
Abel
,
and
Mrs.
Crewthought
she
could
discover
less
asperity
in
his
feelings
towards
his
oldenemy
.
<EOS>
He
desired
Jacob
to
inform
him
daily
how
his
master
went
on
,
andto
be
sure
and
let
him
know
instantly
if
any
material
change
for
theworse
took
place
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
there
is
nothing
I
can
do
for
him
,
"
he
added--"nothing
<EOS>
I
cansend
him
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
,
he
wo
nt
take
any
physic
if
he
knows
it
,
"
said
Jacob
;
"
and
as
towine
or
brandy
,
there
is
n't
a
drop
in
the
house
,
and
has
n't
been
thesefour
or
five
days
.
<EOS>
And
we
ca
n't
send
to
buy
any
,
for
he
only
gives
MissHilda
the
trifle
he
used
to
allow
for
house
expenses
,
and
she
doesn'tlike
to
take
any
of
his
money
,
for
fear
of
angerin
'
him
,
for
he
countsit
every
day
,
and
would
be
sure
to
miss
it
.
<EOS>
"Take
<EOS>
a
bottle
of
wine
and
another
of
brandy
back
with
you
,
Jacob
,
"
saidAbel
.
<EOS>
"Thank'ee
,
<EOS>
sir
--
thank'ee
!
"
rejoined
Jacob
;
"
it
may
be
the
means
o'savin
'
his
life
.
<EOS>
I
'll
mix
a
spoonful
with
his
gruel
,
and
I
dare
sayhe'll
never
find
it
out
.
<EOS>
""Is
there
anything
else
<EOS>
I
can
send
him
?
"
asked
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
My
housekeeperwould
make
him
broths
,
or
jellies
.
<EOS>
We
have
more
convenience
here
thanyou
can
have
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
more
means
as
well
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
I
wo
nt
say
no
,
for
we
reallyare
hardly
put
to
it
to
treat
him
as
he
should
be
treated
.
<EOS>
And
onlythink
of
him
,
rollin
'
in
wealth
,
and
yet
denyin
'
himself
the
commoncomforts
of
existence
--
the
necessaries
,
I
may
say
,
at
a
time
like
this
.
<EOS>
And
then
to
be
indebted
to
you
for
'em
,
sir
--
you
--
of
all
people
in
theworld
.
<EOS>
""Take
<EOS>
care
<EOS>
he
never
knows
it
,
nor
even
suspects
it
,
"
said
Abel
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"Never
<EOS>
fear
,
sir
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
he
shall
learn
nothin'
from
me
.
<EOS>
Buthe'll
never
ask
.
<EOS>
""I
suppose
I
can
not
be
of
any
assistance
to
your
young
lady
,
Jacob?"said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
not
,
ma'am
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
My
poor
young
missis
has
a
hardtask
to
go
through
,
but
she
must
fulfil
it
.
<EOS>
And
brighter
days
,
I
hope
,
are
in
store
for
her
.
<EOS>
"Abel
<EOS>
then
rang
the
bell
,
and
gave
instructions
to
Mr.
Jukes
,
who
takingJacob
to
his
pantry
,
brought
the
wine
and
brandy
his
master
had
ordered
,
and
filled
a
can
with
mutton
broth
for
him
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
have
some
nice
chicken
broth
tomorrow
,
"
said
the
butler
;
"
andin
the
meantime
,
this
will
be
better
than
nothing
.
<EOS>
""I
should
think
so
,
"
replied
Jacob
,
<EOS>
During
the
few
minutes
which
it
had
taken
the
butler
to
go
to
thecellar
,
Jacob
had
found
time
to
dig
deep
into
a
steak
pie
,
and
to
emptya
quart
mug
of
ale
;
but
he
now
started
up
,
put
the
brandy
into
onecapacious
pocket
,
and
the
wine
into
the
other
and
taking
up
the
can
ofbroth
set
off
at
his
quickest
pace
to
the
Little
Sanctuary
.
<EOS>
He
came
daily
for
a
fresh
supply
of
broth
,
which
he
said
,
and
withperfect
truth
,
was
the
main
support
of
his
master
.
<EOS>
Abel
always
saw
himfor
a
few
minutes
when
he
came
,
and
listened
with
the
greatest
interestto
his
accounts
of
the
miser
's
proceedings
.
<EOS>
Jacob
told
him
of
Diggs'svisit
,
and
of
his
suspicion
that
he
had
made
his
will
;
and
concluded
bymentioning
the
sum
of
money
which
the
attorney
had
carried
away
.
<EOS>
Thisaccount
perplexed
and
troubled
Abel
exceedingly
,
and
he
muttered
tohimself
,
"
I
must
make
some
inquiries
about
Diggs
,
and
try
to
find
outwhat
he
does
with
the
money
.
<EOS>
I
hope
this
wretched
old
man
has
not
putthe
crowning
act
to
his
folly
,
and
left
his
property
away
from
hisdaughter
.
<EOS>
""God
forbid
!
"
exclaimed
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
But
there
's
no
sayin
'
what
he
may
do
.
<EOS>
Iwish
you
would
see
him
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""I
would
see
him
if
I
thought
it
would
do
any
good
,
"
replied
Abel
;
"
butI
apprehend
my
interference
would
only
be
productive
of
harm
.
<EOS>
I
must
seehim
before
all
is
over
.
<EOS>
We
have
an
account
to
settle
together
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
you
'd
better
not
put
it
off
too
long
,
"
replied
Jacob
.
<EOS>
Abel
,
however
,
could
not
muster
up
resolution
for
the
painful
scenewhich
he
expected
to
encounter
;
until
one
evening
--
as
he
was
sittingafter
dinner
over
his
wine
,
with
his
sister
,
Randolph
,
andTrussell
--
Jacob
who
had
been
there
before
in
the
morning
,
came
to
informhim
that
the
miser
had
been
so
unwell
all
day
,
and
so
fanciful
andlight
-
headed
,
that
if
he
wished
to
have
any
communication
with
him
<EOS>
whilehe
was
in
his
right
mind
,
he
had
better
not
postpone
his
visit
.
<EOS>
Abelthen
decided
upon
going
at
once
,
and
accordingly
proceeded
with
Jacob
tothe
Little
Sanctuary
,
where
he
had
the
short
and
painful
interview
<EOS>
withthe
miser
,
detailed
in
the
preceding
chapter
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Randulph
was
able
to
go
abroad
.
<EOS>
One
of
his
earliest
visitswas
to
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
who
was
delighted
to
see
him
,
and
shookhim
cordially
by
the
hand
,
repeating
what
he
had
previously
stated
<EOS>
,
thathe
thought
he
had
conducted
himself
admirably
in
the
affair
of
the
duel
.
<EOS>
Sir
Norfolk
then
began
to
talk
of
the
miser
's
illness
,
and
deplored
theposition
of
his
daughter
,
adding
that
he
had
been
several
times
to
callupon
him
,
but
had
always
been
denied
admittance
.
<EOS>
While
they
were
thusconversing
,
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
was
announced
.
<EOS>
Like
Sir
Norfolk
,
heappeared
greatly
pleased
to
see
Randulph
abroad
again
,
and
offered
hiscongratulations
.
<EOS>
"Villiers
<EOS>
was
out
before
you
,
Mr.
Crew
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
I
had
a
visit
fromhim
yesterday
;
but
he
still
wears
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
probably
becausehe
thinks
it
becoming
.
<EOS>
He
came
to
entreat
me
to
offer
his
apologies
toMiss
Scarve
,
and
to
express
his
compunction
for
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
wasincited
to
it
,
he
declares
,
by
the
violence
of
his
passion
for
her
;
buthe
is
now
entirely
cured
,
and
is
heartily
ashamed
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
""He
said
as
much
to
me
,
"
added
Sir
Norfolk
.
"
<EOS>
He
also
expressed
himselfmost
handsomely
about
you
,
Mr.
Crew
,
"
pursued
Sir
Bulkeley
;
"
and
said
hewas
extremely
glad
the
duel
had
terminated
in
the
way
it
did
.
<EOS>
I
hope
,
therefore
,
you
will
be
better
friends
than
ever
.
<EOS>
""We
may
be
better
friends
,
because
we
shall
probably
see
less
of
eachother
,
"
said
Randulph
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
However
,
it
is
pleasant
to
have
suchflattering
things
said
of
one
by
an
adversary
.
<EOS>
"Shortly
<EOS>
afterwards
,
the
party
left
Abingdon
Street
,
and
proceeded
to
theMall
in
Saint
James
's
Park
,
where
they
met
Beau
Villiers
,
Lady
Brabazon
,
and
Clementina
,
together
with
their
constant
attendant
,
Sir
SingeltonSpinke
.
<EOS>
Villiers
,
whose
right
arm
was
sustained
by
a
scarf
,
immediatelyheld
forth
his
disengaged
hand
to
Randulph
,
and
passed
so
many
encomiumsupon
his
courage
and
address
,
that
the
latter
must
have
been
made
ofstubborn
material
indeed
,
to
be
insensible
to
them
.
<EOS>
His
generous
naturewas
sensibly
touched
,
and
he
began
to
think
he
had
done
the
beau
aninjustice
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
,
too
,
exerted
her
utmost
witchery
,
and
told
himwith
a
captivating
smile
,
"
that
if
he
consulted
his
looks
he
would
fighta
duel
and
get
wounded
once
a
month
,
as
he
now
looked
handsomer
thanever
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
interview
ended
in
Randulph
accepting
an
invitation
to
dine
the
nextday
with
Lady
Brabazon
.
<EOS>
Trussell
was
enchanted
.
<EOS>
Accident
,
and
acombination
of
circumstances
,
had
accomplished
precisely
what
he
haddesired
.
<EOS>
As
to
Randulph
,
he
was
annoyed
with
himself
for
having
made
theengagement
;
but
it
was
now
too
late
to
retract
.
<EOS>
He
felt
somewhatembarrassed
as
to
how
to
communicate
the
matter
to
his
mother
;
butTrussell
relieved
him
of
the
difficulty
,
and
,
on
their
return
home
,
gavea
lively
and
diverting
account
of
the
meeting
in
the
park
,
and
said
ithad
led
to
a
reconciliation
dinner
,
which
was
to
take
place
at
LadyBrabazon
's
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
the
dinner
may
not
lead
to
another
quarrel
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
so
too
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
would
discontinue
yourintimacy
with
Lady
Brabazon
,
Randulph,--I
can
not
endure
her
.
<EOS>
""I
do
not
intend
to
continue
it
to
the
same
extent
as
before
,
"
saidRandulph
;
"
but
it
was
impossible
to
refuse
the
present
invitation
.
<EOS>
""Quite
<EOS>
impossible
!
<EOS>
"
echoed
Trussell--"never
was
anything
so
handsome
asVilliers
's
apologies
.
<EOS>
""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Abel
;
"
they
are
as
little
to
be
trusted
as
himself
.
<EOS>
""I
do
n't
think
so
in
the
present
case
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"You
may
take
my
word
for
it
,
you
are
deceived
,
"
rejoined
Abel
.
<EOS>
And
herethe
conversation
dropped
.
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
soon
after
five
o'clock
,
Randulph
and
his
uncle
crossedfrom
the
Palace
Stairs
to
Westminster
,
and
shaped
their
course
towardsthe
Little
Sanctuary
.
<EOS>
Trussell
wished
to
call
for
a
new
peruke
which
hehad
ordered
from
Peter
Pokerich
;
and
while
he
stepped
into
the
littlebarber
's
to
try
it
on
,
Randulph
proceeded
to
the
other
side
of
thestreet
to
make
inquiries
after
the
miser
and
his
daughter
.
<EOS>
"He
's
as
bad
as
he
can
be
,
"
said
Jacob
,
who
answered
his
knock
,
shakinghis
head
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
'm
afraid
this
constant
watchin
'
will
be
too
much
<EOS>
forMiss
Hilda
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
have
a
word
with
you
,
but
I
ca
n't
stop
just
now
,
for
I
'm
wanted
.
<EOS>
Where
shall
you
be
to
-
night?""I
am
going
to
dine
with
Lady
Brabazon
in
Pall
Mall
,
"
said
Randulph
;
"
Ishall
leave
about
ten
,
and
will
call
here
on
my
way
home
.
<EOS>
""No
<EOS>
;
I
'll
step
up
to
her
ladyship
's
at
ten
,
"
said
Jacob
;
"
and
I
'll
waittill
you
come
out
.
<EOS>
We
may
have
somethin'
to
do
together
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
he
closed
the
door
,
and
Randulph
walked
across
the
street
toPeter
Pokerich
's
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
a
chair
was
seen
advancing
alongthe
street
,
which
stopped
at
Mr.
Deacle
's
,
the
mercer
,
and
being
opened
,
let
forth
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
very
gaily
dressed
,
who
skipped
into
themercer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
Having
witnessed
the
old
beau
's
entrance
,
Randulph
turnedinto
the
barber
's
,
and
told
his
uncle
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
"Sir
<EOS>
Singleton
must
be
gone
to
pay
court
to
the
fair
Thomasine
,
"
saidTrussell
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
remark
,
Peter
,
without
saying
a
word
,
darted
out
of
theshop
,
and
hurried
to
the
neighbouring
house
.
<EOS>
Trussell
was
at
firstdisposed
to
be
angry
,
but
on
reflecting
on
the
probable
cause
of
thebarber
's
sudden
flight
,
he
burst
into
a
loud
laugh
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
go
and
see
what
happens
,
"
he
said
,
arranging
his
wig
.
<EOS>
The
little
barber
,
meanwhile
,
had
entered
the
mercer
's
shop
.
<EOS>
There
wasno
one
in
attendance
in
front
but
an
apprentice
,
who
did
not
notice
him
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
stepped
lightly
and
quickly
towards
the
door
of
the
innerroom
,
which
was
left
ajar
,
enabling
him
to
hear
what
passed
within
,
while
the
upper
port
being
glazed
,
shewed
him
that
the
speakers
were
SirSingleton
and
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
The
old
beau
was
on
his
knees
,
while
thefair
Thomasine
had
abandoned
her
hand
to
him
,
though
she
averted
herlooks
from
him
;
owing
to
which
circumstance
,
she
did
not
discover
thejealous
eyes
of
the
barber
glaring
at
her
through
the
window
.
<EOS>
As
toPeter
,
he
tugged
at
his
wig
with
jealous
rage
,
and
would
have
pluckedhandfuls
of
hair
from
it
,
if
it
would
have
yielded
.
<EOS>
But
the
wig
wasstoutly
made
,
and
resisted
his
efforts
bravely
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
rise
till
I
have
a
favorable
answer
,
<EOS>
adorable
Thomasine!"said
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
mine?--will
you
fly
with
me?""I
<EOS>
can
not
,
"
replied
the
fair
Thomasine
,
turning
round
with
suchsuddenness
that
the
little
barber
had
barely
time
to
duck
down
to
escapeobservation
.
<EOS>
"
I
can
not
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
told
you
a
hundred
times
,
I
amengaged
to
Peter
Pokerich
.
<EOS>
""I
will
cut
the
little
rascal
's
throat
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Sir
Singleton
,
rising
,
and
clapping
his
hand
on
his
sword
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
belabour
him
with
his
ownpole
.
<EOS>
""No
,
do
n't
!
"
said
the
fair
Thomasine--"I
should
go
distracted
,
likeOphelia
,
if
any
harm
were
to
happen
to
him
.
<EOS>
Poor
Peter
is
so
very
fondof
me
--
so
very
,
very
fond
!
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
he
was
a
little
inconstant
,
tobe
sure
--
slightly
dazzled
by
the
charms
of
the
miser
's
lovely
daughter
.
<EOS>
But
latterly
,
he
has
become
quite
devoted
.
<EOS>
""He
can
not
love
you
a
thousandth
part
as
well
as
I
love
you
.
"
<EOS>
said
theold
beau--"it
is
not
in
his
vulgar
nature
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
I
can
make
you
LadySpinke
--
can
put
you
at
the
head
of
a
splendid
establishment

cover
youwith

<EOS>
""It
sounds
delightful
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
"
said
the
fair
Thomasine
,
whose
eyessparkled
at
the
beau
's
enumeration
of
the
pleasures
he
had
in
store
forher
.
<EOS>
"
But
will
you
really
make
me
Lady
Spinke?""I
<EOS>
swear
it

<EOS>
cried
the
old
beau

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh

<EOS>
you
are
mine!--say
<EOS>

you
're
too
old

the
fair
Thomasine

<EOS>
"
I
do

"The
<EOS>
unhappy

almost
sunk
into

<EOS>
"Too
old

"
exclaimed
Sir
Singleton
.
<EOS>
"
Why
I
'm
in
the
very
prime
of

<EOS>
But
granting
that
I
am
old

you
'll

be

Lady

handsome

<EOS>
think
of
that!""A
large

very

said
the

,
musingly
.
<EOS>
"You

I
'm

my

cried
the

""Lady

"And

""Don't

<EOS>
"Well

the

pressing

"
Farewell

<EOS>
At
five
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
little
barber
had
heard
enough
.
<EOS>
He
darted
off
like
a
madman
,
andalmost
upset
Trussell
and
Randulph
,
<EOS>
who
as
well
as
himself
,
hadoverheard
what
had
passed
.
<EOS>
The
next
moment
,
the
old
beau
issued
forth
,
singing
a
French
song
and
twirling
his
cane
gaily
.
<EOS>
"Ah
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
perceiving
Trussell
and
Randulph
,
"
what
the
deucebrings
you
here?""We
came
to
look
after
the
little
barber
,
who
ran
away

leaving
my
wigonly
half
dressed

"
replied
Trussell
,
"
He
has
just
rushed
out
of
thisshop
as
if
he
had
gone
distracted
.
<EOS>
""The
devil
!
"
exclaimed
Sir
Singleton
;
"
then
he
has
overheard
my
plan

<EOS>
Imust
change
it

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
stepping
back
to
the
fair
Thomasine
,
he
whispered
,
"
Peter

been
playing
the
spy

<EOS>
He
may
interfere

<EOS>
To

morning
at
five
.
<EOS>
Till
then
,
ma
belle

adieu
!
"
<EOS>
And
kissing
his
hand
to
her
,
he
rejoinedhis
friends
.
<EOS>
"You
are
both
going
to
Lady
Brab
's
,
I
suppose
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
Sorry
I
can'ttake
<EOS>
you
--
we
shall
meet
again
in
a
few
minutes
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
and
strutting
off
triumphantly
,
he
entered
his
chair
,
and
wasconveyed
to
Lady
Brabazon
's
,
where
Randulph
and
his
uncle
arrived
a
fewminutes
after
him
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
passed
off
delightfully
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
small
party
,
consisting
ofSir
Bulkeley
Price
,
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
Firebras
,
and
Lady
Fazakerly
.
<EOS>
Everything
was
done
to
please
Randulph
,
and
the
efforts
were
perfectlysuccessful
.
<EOS>
The
wine
flowed
freely
after
dinner
--
for
it
was
a
harddrinking
age
--
and
Randulph
,
who
had
been
exceedingly
temperate
since
theduel
,
began
to
feel
the
effect
of
it
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
about
to
ascend
to
thedrawing
-
room
with
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
,
a
note
was
handed
him
by
aservant
,
which
he
instantly
opened
.
<EOS>
"What
says
your
billet
,
nephew
?
"
<EOS>
inquired
Trussell
,
who
was
standing
by
.
"Oh
!
<EOS>
it
is
from
Kitty
Conway
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
She
has
found
out
,
I
knownot
how
,
that
I
am
here
,
and
wishes
me
to
sup
with
her
to
-
night
for
thelast
time
.
<EOS>
""And
you
will
go
,
wo
n't
you
?
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Not
<EOS>
I
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
irresolutely
.
<EOS>
"Oh
,
yes
,
you
will
,
"
said
Trussell
;
"
and
I
'll
accompany
you
on
your
lastvisit
,
as
I
did
on
your
first
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
they
went
upstairs
laughingly
to
the
drawing
-
room
.
<EOS>
Time
passed
by
so
fleetly
in
the
fascinating
society
of
Lady
Brabazon
,
that
Randulph
was
surprised
,
on
glancing
at
his
watch
,
to
find
that
itwas
nearly
eleven
o'clock
.
<EOS>
"Jacob
will
be
gone
,
"
he
thought
,
"
and
will
think
I
have
forgotten
him
.
"Hastily
<EOS>
taking
leave
of
Lady
Brabazon
,
who
chided
him
playfully
forrunning
away
so
early
,
and
engaged
him
to
call
upon
her
on
the
followingmorning
,
he
went
downstairs
,
accompanied
by
Trussell
.
<EOS>
They
found
Jacobat
the
door
,
and
in
no
very
bland
humour
at
having
been
kept
so
long
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
time
's
more
than
up
,
"
said
Jacob
gruffly
,
"
and
I
was
just
goin'away
.
<EOS>
What
I
wanted
to
say
to
you
is
this
.
<EOS>
I
've
received
a
hint
thatmaster
's
miserly
nevy
,
Phillip
Frewin
,
is
about
to
decamp
with
the
moneyI
gave
Mr.
Diggs
t'other
day

<EOS>
He
's
at
the
Crown
Inn
,
Ox
-
Yard
,
KingStreet
.
<EOS>
Suppose
you
pay
him
a
visit
.
<EOS>
""I'll
readily
do
so
to

morrow
,
Jacob

"
said
Randulph
;
"
but
to
-
night
,
I'mengaged
.
<EOS>
Come
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
My
way
lies
in
the
same
direction
as
yours
,
and
shall
be
glad
if
you
'll
accompany
me
.
<EOS>
I
want
to
talk
to
you
aboutyour
master
and
young
mistress
.
<EOS>
"Jacob
<EOS>
complied
,
and
accompanied
Randulph
to
the
corner
of
Hedge
Lane
,
anarrow
thoroughfare
running
into
Cockspur
Street
,
where
he
took
hisleave
.
<EOS>
Randulph
and
his
uncle
then
tracked
the
lane
above
mentioned
,
until
they
came
to
Whitcomb
Street
,
where
Kitty
Conway
then
resided
,
having
removed
from
the
Haymarket
to
an
old
house
in
the
latter
street
,
erected
three
years
after
the
Great
Fire
of
London
,
namely
,
1669.Randulph
never
having
visited
the
pretty
actress
in
her
new
abode
,
shehad
told
him
,
that
this
date
,
which
was
inscribed
in
large
figures
on
ashield
over
the
door
,
would
guide
him
to
it
.
<EOS>
As
Randulph
was
looking
out
for
the
house
,
he
observed
three
men
at
alittle
distance
behind
him
,
who
seemed
to
be
dogging
him
and
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
The
foremost
of
them
was
a
tall
,
thin
man
;
the
second
a
stout
square
-
setpersonage
,
dressed
in
a
shabby
military
garb
;
and
the
third
a
greathulking
fellow
,
with
an
atrociously
black
muzzle
,
dressed
in
abluejacket
,
short
trowsers
,
and
woollen
cap
.
<EOS>
Randulph
could
not
help
fancying
he
had
seen
these
personages
before
,
though
he
could
not
tell
where
,
but
he
did
not
concern
himself
muchabout
them
,
until
just
as
he
had
discovered
Kitty
Conway
's
dwelling
,
andwas
about
to
knock
at
the
door
,
he
saw
that
they
were
quickening
theirpace
towards
him
.
<EOS>
On
a
nearer
approach
,
he
was
at
no
loss
to
detect
inthe
foremost
,
Philip
Frewin
;
in
the
shabby
military
man
,
the
bravo
,
Captain
Culpepper
;
and
in
the
athletic
,
black
muzzled
sailor
,
the
fellowwho
had
officiated
as
Jack
-
in
-
the
-
water
at
the
Folly
on
the
Thames
.
<EOS>
"Here
is
your
man
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Philip
,
pointing
to
Randulph
,
"
upon
him
!
<EOS>
don'tleave
<EOS>
an
unbroken
bone
in
his
body
.
<EOS>
"Randulph
<EOS>
,
however
,
was
prepared
for
the
attack
.
<EOS>
Grasping
the
stout
canehe
held
in
his
hand
,
he
dealt
Philip
so
severe
a
blow
on
the
head
<EOS>
withit
,
that
he
stretched
him
on
his
back
on
the
ground
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
Trussell
received
a
blow
from
the
cudgel
of
the
black
-
muzzled
ruffianwhich
sent
him
reeling
against
the
door
,
to
the
posts
of
which
he
clungfor
support
,
while
the
fellow
,
turning
to
assault
Randulph
,
encounteredan
unexpected
adversary
in
the
person
of
Jacob
Post
.
<EOS>
"I
thought
what
you
were
after
,
you
scoundrels
,
when
I
saw
you
doggin'these
gen'l'men
,
"
cried
Jacob
;
"
I
'm
glad
I
got
up
in
time

this
way

you
black

muzzled
hound

<EOS>
Two

<EOS>
"While
<EOS>
Jacob
and
his
antagonist
rapped
away
at
each
other
as
hard
as
theycould
,
making
the
welkin
ring
with
their
blows
,
Randulph
turned
uponCulpepper
,
who
attempted
to
draw
his
sword
to
assail
him
,
and
belabouredhim
so
lustily
with
his
cane
,
that
the
latter
was
soon
fain
to
cry
forquarter
.
<EOS>
The
sound
of
the
cudgels
,
and
the
vociferations
of
the
combatants
,
hadalarmed
the
watch
,
who
springing
their
rattles
,
hastened
to
the
scene
ofstrife
,
while
Kitty
Conway
,
hearing
the
noise
,
opened
a
window
above
,
and
seeing
what
was
passing
in
the
street
,
added
her
shrieks
to
thegeneral
clamour
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
the
watch
could
come
up
,
Jacob
had
brought
hisblack
-
muzzled
antagonist
to
the
ground
,
while
Culpepper
had
taken
to
hisheels
without
being
able
to
strike
a

blow

TRUSSELL
WERELOCKED
UP

IN

WATCH

HOUSE.Seeing
no
chance
of

,
Philip
Frewin
suddenly
started
to
his
feet

and
running
towards
the
watchman
,
plucked
off
his
wig
to
show
the
extentof
the
injuries
he
had
received

charged
the
others
with

"My

he
groaned
;
"
and
if
you
had
n't
comeup
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
I
should
have
been
killed
outright
.
<EOS>
There
stands
theruffian
,
who
knocked
me
down
,
"
he
added
,
pointing
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
yourself
commenced
the
assault
,
scoundrel
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
stepping
forward
;
"
and
if
you
have
been
severely
punished
,
you
have
onlymet
with
your
desert
.
<EOS>
""This
device
shall
not
serve
your
turn
,
villain
,
"
rejoined
Philip
.
<EOS>
"Secure
<EOS>
him
,
watchman
.
<EOS>
I
'll
swear
he
meant
to
rob
and
murder
me
.
<EOS>
""This
is
a
serious
charge
,
"
said
the
watchman
to
Randulph
;
"
and
if
thegen'l'man
persist
in
it
,
I
must
take
you
in
custody
.
<EOS>
I
was
in
hopes
<EOS>
,
andso
was
you
,
Charley
,
was
n't
you
,
"
he
added
,
appealing
to
the
otherwatchman
,
who
replied
by
a
confirmatory
grunt
,
"
that
it
was
only
a
bitof
a
fight
between
some
gentlefolks
about
a
girl
,
or
some
triflingmatter
of
the
sort
,
and
that
it
might
be
set
to
rights
by
a
bowl
ofpunch
among
themselves
,
and
a
crown
or
so
to
us
,
poor
fellows
.
<EOS>
But
thisis
another
matter
altogether
.
<EOS>
""What
has
been
stated
is
utterly
false
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
waswalking
quietly
along
this
street
with
my
relative
,
who
has
sustainedquite
as
much
personal
damage
as
any
one
in
the
fray
,
when
thisscoundrel
,
accompanied
by
two
other
ruffians
,
suddenly
attacked
me
;
andif
it
had
not
been
for
the
assistance
afforded
me
by
that
stout
porter,"pointing
to
Jacob
Post
,
"
I
might
not
now
be
in
a
condition
to
give
thisexplanation
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
young
gen'l'man
speaks
the
truth
,
watchman
,
"
interposed
Jacob
;
"
ifthere
's
been
any
robbery
and
assault
intended
,
(
which
I
doubt
,
)
<EOS>
ithasn't
been
on
his
part
.
<EOS>
""You
wo
nt
listen
to
what
this
fellow
says
,
watchman
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Philip;"he
's
one
of
the
gang
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
declare
I
'm
quite
perplexed
by
these
contradictory
statements
,
Charley
,
"
said
the
foremost
watchman
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
s'pose
the
best

to
take
'em
all
to

<EOS>
""I

s'pose

Sam

"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"I
sha
n't
be
taken

"
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
,
gruffly
;
"
what
'll
become
of
my
poormaster
,
if
I
do
n't
go
home?""You
hear
what
he
says
,
watchman
?
"
cried
Philip
;
"
he
wants
to
be
off
.
<EOS>
Secure
him
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
ay
,
never
fear
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
watchman
,
throwing
himself
on
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"Spring
<EOS>
the
rattle
,
Charley
.
<EOS>
"His
<EOS>
comrade
obeyed
,
and
by
this
time
several
other
persons
having
comeup
,
Jacob
was
secured
,
and
Randulph
,
who
offered
no
resistance
,
surrounded
and
made
prisoner
.
<EOS>
Trussell
,
who
had
partly
recovered
fromthe
effects
of
the
blow
,
was
likewise
seized
,
and
the
black

muzzledJack
,
who
appeared
much
injured
,
was
also
lifted
up
,
and
supportedbetween
two
men

<EOS>
After
some
further
objurgation
and
discussion
,
theforemost
watchman
gave
the
word
to
move
on
,
when
the
door
of
the
housenear
them
opened
,
and
Kitty
Conway
rushed
forth
,
and
made
her
waythrough
the
crowd
,
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"This
is
all
a
mistake
!
"
<EOS>
she
cried
to
the
watchmen
;
"
you
are
taking
awaythe
wrong
persons
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
,
was
coming
to
supwith
me
.
<EOS>
I
was
expecting
him
,
and
hearing
a
noise
in
the
street
,
Iopened
my
window
,
and
witnessed
the
affray
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
and
what
did
you
see
,
<EOS>
madam
--
<EOS>
what
did
you
see
?
"
demanded
Philip
,
fiercely
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
saw
Randulph
Crew
knock
you
down
,
"
replied
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"To
be
sure
.
"
<EOS>
replied
Philip
;
"
he
did
knock
me
down
,
and
would
havekilled
me
if
he
could
.
<EOS>
This
woman
's
evidence
corroborates
my
statement
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
heard
from
the
shouts
that
you
were
the
first
assailant
,
Philip,"replied
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Besides
,
Captain
Culpepper
was
with
you,--though
<EOS>
he
wasbeaten
off
by
Randulph
.
<EOS>
""Don't
<EOS>
Philip
me
,
ma'am
!
"
cried
the
other
;
"
I
do
n't
know
you

don'tdesire

neither

anything

<EOS>
Youwant
to
get
off
your
friend
<EOS>

that
's
evident
,
but
it
wo

do

<EOS>
He
'll
passthe
night
in

instead
of
supping
with
you

<EOS>
Go
on
,
watchman!""I
should
n't
mind
being
locked
up
in
the
watchhouse

"
said
Jacob
;
"
butwhat'll
my
young
missis
think
of
it?--what'll
become
of
my
poor
<EOS>
master?If
anythin
'
happens
to
him
,
I
shall
never
forgive
myself
.
<EOS>
I
wishsomebody
would
take
a
message
from
me
to
Miss
Scarve
in
the
LittleSanctuary,--it
would
make
me
more
easy
.
<EOS>
""I
will
take
it
,
"
said
Kitty
,
readily
;
"
and
will
explain
all
.
<EOS>
""You
!
"
exclaimed
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
No
;
that
'll
never
do

<EOS>
"
<EOS>
But
before
he
could
getout
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
,
Kitty
had
retired
,
and
he
was
forcedon
by
his
captors
.
<EOS>
The
party
took
the
direction
of
Piccadilly
,
Philip
Frewin
walking
by
theside
of
Sam
,
the
foremost
watchman
,
who
kept
fast
hold
of
his
arm
,
andthe
others
following
.
<EOS>
As
they
drew
near
the
top
of
the
Haymarket
,
Philipsaid
in
a
low
tone
to
the
watchman,--"You'll
make
more
out
of
this
jobby
letting
me
go
,
than
by
detaining
me
.
<EOS>
""Which
way
?
"
asked
Sam
,
in
the
same
tone
.
<EOS>
"Here
are
five
guineas
,
"
replied
Philip
,
slipping
a
purse
into
theother
's
hand
;
"
contrive
my
escape
,
and
that
of
the
black
-
muzzled
fellowin
the
sailor
's
dress
;
but
lock
up
the
others
all
night
.
<EOS>
"Sam
held
the
money
to
the
light
,
and
saw
that
it
was
all
right
.
"I'll
<EOS>
manage
it
,
"
he
said
.
<EOS>
"
So
the
charge
you
preferred
against
'em
wasall
gammon
,
eh?""To
be
sure
,
"
replied
Philip
;
"
but
keep
them
safely
under
lock
and
keytill
to
-
morrow
morning
,
and
I
'll
double
what
I
've
just
given
you

<EOS>
You'llfind
me
on
the
spot
to

morrow
night
,
at
ten
.
<EOS>
""That'll
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
Sam
.
"
<EOS>
And
here
we
're
at
the
top
o

the
Haymarket

<EOS>
Give
me
a
push

then
make
off
as
fast
as
you
can

<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
ofthe
rest
.
<EOS>
Your
black
-
muzzled
friend
shall
get
his
liberty
by
-
and
-
by
.
"Philip
<EOS>
obeyed
these
instructions
to
the
letter
.
<EOS>
Turning
suddenly
uponthe
watchman
,
and
thrusting
him
forcibly
backwards
,
he
set
off
as
fastas
his
legs
could
carry
him
.
<EOS>
Sam
instantly
started
in
pursuit
,
callingloudly
to
his
brethren
to
take
care
of
the
other
prisoners
;
but
hereturned
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
out
of
breath
,
and
swearing
that
thefellow
had
managed
to
get
off
.
<EOS>
Feigning
to
be
in
a
very
ill
-
humour
,
hereturned
a
surly
reply
to
Randulph
's
remarks
on
his
carelessness
,
andhurried
the
prisoners
along
until
they
reached
Air
-
street
,
where
thewatch
-
house
was
situated
.
<EOS>
The
door
was
instantly
opened
by
a
constable
,
with
whom
Sam
exchanged
a
few
words
in
an
undertone
;
after
which
theprisoners
were
led
down
a
narrow
,
dirty
passage
,
and
thrust
into
afilthy
looking
hole
,
furnished
only
with
a
couple
of
benches
,
on
whichthree
or
four
persons
of
very
equivocal
appearance
were
stretched
.
<EOS>
Samthen
,
for
the
first
time
,
appeared
to
notice
the
absence
of
theblack
-
muzzled
Jack
,
and
inquiring
where
he
was
,
was
told
that
he
hadalso
contrived
to
escape
.
"Escaped
!
<EOS>
has
he
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Sam
,
affecting
to
be
in
a
great
passion
;
"
whyzounds
!
<EOS>
they
slip
out
of
your
fingers
like
eels
.
<EOS>
However
,
those
threeare
safe
enough
,
that
's
some
comfort
.
<EOS>
""If
our
accuser
is
gone
<EOS>
,
"
cried
Randulph
,
looking
round
the
chamber
withinexpressible
disgust
,
"
<EOS>
why
are
we
detained?""You're
detained
on
a
serious
charge
,
"
replied
Sam
;
"
and
I
ca
n't
takeupon
me
to
let
you
go
.
<EOS>
But
I
'll
fetch
Mr.
Foggo
,
the
constable
,
and
ifhe
likes
to
liberate
you
,
that
'll
be
his
concern
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
went
forth
with
his
comrades
,
locking
the
door
after
him
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>
agreeable
situation
,
uncle
,
"
said
Randulph
to
Trussell
,
who
hadseated
himself
on
the
extremity
of
one
of
the
benches
.
<EOS>
"Agreeable
<EOS>
enough
,
"
groaned
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
Oh
,
my
poor
head!""What
would
my
dear
young
missis
,
or
your
good
mother
think
of
us
,
ifthey
could
see
us
now
in
this
place
,
and
with
this
company
?
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"I'd
rather
have
got
a
cracked
crown
myself
than
Mrs.
Conway
<EOS>
should
callon
Miss
Hilda
.
<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
would
I
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
come
,
<EOS>
no
grumbling
,
"
cried
Trussell
,
rousing
himself
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
thegreatest
sufferer
,
after
all
.
<EOS>
Everything
will
be
set
right
in
themorning
,
and
in
the
meantime
,
let
's
pass
the
night
as
comfortably
as
wecan
.
<EOS>
It
's
not
the
first
time
I
've
been
in
a
watch
-
house
.
<EOS>
Depend
upon
itwe
sha
n't
be
liberated
;
but
,
I
'll
engage
to
say
,
we
can
get
a
betterroom
than
this
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
it
turned
out
.
<EOS>
In
about
ten
minutes
,
Sam
made
his
appearance
,
with
Mr.
Foggo
,
who
said
he
could
not
discharge
the
prisoners
till
theyhad
been
before
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
"Can't
<EOS>
you
give
us
a
little
better
accommodation
,
Mr.
Foggo
?
<EOS>
"
askedTrussell
,
slipping
a
guinea
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
constable
said
nothing
,
but
took
them
into
a
back
room
,
furnishedwith
a
small
deal
table
,
and
three
or
four
rush
-
bottomed
chairs
.
<EOS>
"This
is
a
room
after
my
poor
master
's
own
heart
,
"
said
Jacob
,
lookingat
the
bare
walls
and
grated
windows
.
<EOS>
"Anything
<EOS>
I
can
get
you
,
gen'l'men
?
<EOS>
"
asked
the
constable
,
as
he
set
alight
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
"I
suppose
we
must
stay
here
all
night
,
Mr.
Foggo
?
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"We're
<EOS>
family
men
--
and
our
ladies
will
be
excessively
annoyed
at
ourabsence
.
<EOS>
""Sorry
<EOS>
for
it
,
sir
,
but
you
must
stay
,
"
replied
the
constable
.
<EOS>
"
If
youdesire
it
,
I
dare
say
I
can
so
manage
it
that
you
sha
n't
come
before
hisworship
.
<EOS>
And
in
the
meantime
,
though
it
's
against
rules,--but
<EOS>
I
don'tmind
obliging
a
gentleman,--if
<EOS>
,
I
say
,
a
bowl
of
punch
would
beagreeable--""A
bowl
of
punch
,
by
all
means
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Trussell
,
"
here
's
money
for
it,"he
added
,
giving
him
another
guinea
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
see
you
understand
our
ways
,
sir
,
"
said
the
constable
,
bowing
.
<EOS>
And
heleft
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Come
,
do

be
downcast

my

"
<EOS>
cried
Trussell
,
clapping
his
nephewon
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
"
We
shall
have
a
jolly
night
of
it
after
all

<EOS>
My
headis
getting
better
every

<EOS>
If
Hilda

your

they
'll
only
laugh
at

<EOS>
I
've

hope
I

<EOS>
So
cheer
up

<EOS>
Your

would
have
been
incomplete
without

<EOS>
"Randulph
could
not
help
responding
to
his
uncle
's
laugh
,
and
Mr.
Foggoshortly
after
appearing
with
a
bowl
of
excellent
punch
,
he
began
tothink
that
the
best
way
was
to
make
himself
comfortable
.
<EOS>
Jacob
,
too
,
yielded
to
the
genial
influence
of
the
liquor
;
and
,
ere
long
,
they
wereall
laughing
as
merrily
as
if
they
were
at
large

The
bowl

,
Trussell
disposed
himself
to
slumber
in
his
chair
;
Jacobstretched
himself
at
full
length
on

floor

Randulph

THE

Conway
was
as
good
as

word

<EOS>
Scarcely
had
the
watchmen
departedwith
their
prisoners
,
than
she
set
out
for
the
Little
Sanctuary
.
<EOS>
With
abeating
heart
and
trembling
hand
she
knocked
at
the
miser
's
door
;
buther
summons
remained
unanswered
,
and
she
was
about
to
repeat
it
,
when
aman
crossed
the
street
and
addressed
her
.
<EOS>
"Mr

<EOS>
Scarve
is
very
ill

ma'am
,
"
he
said--"dangerously
ill

<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I

replied
Kitty

"
<EOS>
I

,
knocking
again

waiting
vainly
for

<EOS>
"I

said
the

""What

exclaimed
the

starting
:

<EOS>
This
is
an

Would

added

with
agroan--"that

who

"
<EOS>
askedKitty

"Sir

Singleton
Spinke

"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Do
you
know
him
,
<EOS>
ma'am?""Perfectly
well
,
"
replied
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"Then
you
do
n't
require
to
be
told
what
a
dreadful
old
rake
<EOS>
he
is,"replied
the
other
;
"
nor
will
you
wonder
at
my
resentment
against
him
,
when
I
tell
you
he
has
attempted
to
run
away
with
my
betrothed
.
<EOS>
""Your
betrothed
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Kitty
:
"
pray
what
is
her
<EOS>
name?""She
is
generally
denominated
the
fair
Thomasine
,
"
replied
the
other;"but
<EOS>
perhaps
I
ought
to
call
her
Miss
Deacle
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
then
I
know
who
you
are
,
"
rejoined
Kitty
:
"
you
are
Peter
Pokerich
,
the
little
barber
.
<EOS>
""Right
,
madam
,
"
he
replied
:
"
I
am
that
unfortunate
individual
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
how
does
Sir
Singleton
mean
to
rob
you
of
your
mistress,--let
mehear
?
"
asked
Kitty
.
<EOS>
"He
has
made
her
an
offer
of
marriage
,
"
replied
Peter
,
"
and
she
hasaccepted
him
--
perfidious
that
she
is
!
<EOS>
I
asked
her
to
sup
with
meto
-
night
,
for
the
last
time
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
ofupbraiding
her
,
and
she
has
accepted
the
invitation
.
<EOS>
I
'm
waiting
for
hernow
,
for
she
ca
n't
get
out
till
the
old
people
go
to
bed
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
spoke
,
the
mercer
's
door
opened
,
and
a
female
figure
issued
fromit
.
"There
<EOS>
she
is
,
I
declare
!
"
<EOS>
cried
the
little
barber
.
<EOS>
"
I
'm
so
angry
withher
for
her
treachery
,
that
I
could
almost
kill
her
.
<EOS>
""Don't
think
of
such
nonsense
,
"
replied
Kitty
:
"
if
you
want
to
revengeyourself
,
I
'll
tell
you
how
to
do
it
--
pretend
to
make
love
to
me
.
<EOS>
""That
's
easily
done
,
"
replied
the
barber--"permit
me
to
take
yourhand

<EOS>
I'll
affect
not
to
see
the
deceitful
little

let
me
entreatyou

"
he
added
,
putting
on
an
impassioned
air
,
"
to
come
in
withme

we
can
converse
so
much
more
pleasantly
than
in

somebodymay
overhear

<EOS>
""Somebody
does
overhear
you

you
little
wretch

cried
the
fairThomasine
,
stopping
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Good
gracious
!
<EOS>
if
he
is
n't
making
love
to

I
wonder
who
she
can
be

<EOS>
""She
sees
us

"
whispered
Kitty
;
"
the
plan
will
do
.
<EOS>
I
'll
feignreluctance
.
<EOS>
Oh
no
,
I
ca
n't
go
in
with
you

"
she
added
,
irresolutely
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
beseech
you
,
do
,
"
<EOS>
replied
Peter
:
"
I
expected
a
visit
from
aneighbour

Miss
Thomasine
Deacle

I
've
prepared

but
I
wo

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
so
you
want
me
to
take
her
place
?
"
cried
Kitty
.
"
<EOS>
Very
flattering
,
indeed
!
<EOS>
I
dare
say
you
'll
try
to
persuade
me
next
that
you
prefer

<EOS>
""So
<EOS>
I
do
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
:
"
I
prefer

greatly

<EOS>
you're
a

<EOS>
""I
shall
burst
with
rage

"
<EOS>
cried
the
fair
Thomasine
:
"
I
could
tear
hisdisagreeable
little
eyes
out

<EOS>
""Well
,
since
you
're
so
pressing

I
'll
just
go
in

saidKitty

I
wo

sit
down

as
to
supper--""You'll
just
eat
a
mouthful

<EOS>
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Oh
<EOS>
,
I
've
no
doubt
she
'll
enjoy
herself
nicely

said
the
fairThomasine
:
"
<EOS>
but
I
'll
spoil
their
pastime
--
that
I
<EOS>
will!""This
way
,
madam
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
,
handing
the
pretty
actress
towards
hisdwelling
.
<EOS>
"She
's
close
behind
us
,
"
whispered
Kitty
:
"
contrive
to
let
her
get
inwithout
observation
.
<EOS>
"Peter
<EOS>
signified
his
assent
in
a
whisper
,
and
pretending
to
offer
themost
gallant
attention
to
the
actress
left
the
door
purposely
open
.
<EOS>
Unconscious
of
the
trick
practised
upon
her
,
the
fair
Thomasine
slippedin
after
them
,
and
hid
herself
behind
a
large
wooden
case
,
on
whichseveral
wig
-
blocks
were
set
.
<EOS>
Having
caught
a
glimpse
of
what
had
occurred
,
Kitty
squeezed
Peter'shand
to
let
him
know
how
matters
stood
,
and
he
immediately
took
thehint
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
declare
I
've
left
the
door
open
,
"
he
said
,
locking
it
;
"
howexcessively
careless
in
me
!
<EOS>
The
fair
Thomasine
might
get
in
,
andsurprise
us
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
has
got
beforehand
with
you
,
sir
,
"
muttered
the
young
lady
alludedto
,
looking
up
for
an
instant
from
behind
the
case
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
now
,
ma'am
,
"
said
Peter
,
lighting
a
couple
of
candles
,
and
placingthem
upon
the
table
,
on
which
cold
chickens
and
other
viands
were
<EOS>
laid,"you'll
take
a
little
supper
with
me?""Well
<EOS>
,
it
looks
so
nice
that
it
almost
tempts
me
,
"
said
Kitty
,
seatingherself
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
could
manage
the
wing
of
a
chicken
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
helped
her
as
she
required
,
Peter
ran
to
a
cupboard
,
and
broughtout
a
bottle
of
wine
.
<EOS>
"This
is
some
delicious
Constantia
which
I
got
for
the
fair
<EOS>
Thomasine,"he
said
,
pouring
out
a
glass
;
<EOS>
"
but
I
'm
glad
you
'll
drink
it
instead
ofher

<EOS>
""Hear

to

absent
friends

"
said
Kitty
,
taking
the
glass
.
<EOS>
"I
pledge
you

rejoined
the
little
barber
;
"
though
,
I
should
be
sorryto
change

<EOS>
""Oh
,
the
horrid
,
deceitful
little
monster

"
cried
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"He
was
never
half
so
gallant

<EOS>
""By

said
Peter
,
"
your

so
fascinated

omitted

ask
your

the

so

Peter

I
wish

<EOS>
She
wo

<EOS>
Now
,
I
should
have
made
her

areally
good

devotedly

I

delighted

made

Here'sto

he
added

filling
the

again

I

""Then

stepping
forward

burstingfrom

vengeance

<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
lend
you
my
columbine
's
dress
,
"
said
the
fair
Thomasine
;
"
it
<EOS>
willjust
fit
you
--
and
my
mask
.
<EOS>
Come
with
me
.
<EOS>
You
have
n't
a
moment
to
spare
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
quicker
the
better
,
"
said
Kitty
;
"
for
if
I
give
myself
time
forreflection
,
I
sha
n't
do
it
.
<EOS>
"They
then
hurried
away
,
and
Peter
having
helped
himself
to
another
glassof
Constantia
,
and
put
out
the
candles
,
followed
them
,
and
concealedhimself
in
an
alley
near
the
mercer
's
dwelling
,
where
he
could
see
,
unobserved
,
all
that
passed
.
<EOS>
Punctually
as
the
abbey
clock
strucktwelve
,
the
sound
of
wheels
was
heard
--
a
carriage
drew
up
at
the
corner
,
and
the
next
moment
,
the
old
beau
was
seen
cautiously
advancing
on
theopposite
side
of
the
street
.
<EOS>
Finding
the
coast
clear
,
he
advancedtowards
the
mercer
's
door
,
and
tapped
against
it
.
<EOS>
It
was
partiallyopened
,
and
a
low
voice
inquired
from
within--"Is
it
<EOS>
you?""Yes
,
it
's
me
,
my
angel
,
"
replied
the
old
beau
;
<EOS>
"
Sir
SingletonSpinke
--
your
devoted
admirer!""I'm
quite
ready
,
"
replied
the
speaker
,
stepping
forth
,
and
lookingexactly
like
the
fair
Thomasine
dressed
for
the
masquerade
at
Ranelagh
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
you
've
got
on
your
columbine
's
dress
,
"
said
Sir
Singleton
,
approvingly
.
<EOS>
"It
's
the
prettiest
I
have
<EOS>
,
"
replied
the
lady
;
"
and
I
thought
you
wouldlike
me
better
in
it
than
in
any
other
.
<EOS>
""You
could
n't
have
made
a
better
choice
,
"
replied
the
old
beau
;
"
infact
,
you
could
n't
choose
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
why
that
envious
mask?""I
put
it
on
to
hide
my
blushes
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
nor
shall
I
removeit
till
we
are
united
.
<EOS>
But
you
must
drive
to
the
Fleet
at
once
--
<EOS>
I'll
gonowhere
else
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
n't
desire
you
to
do
so
,
my
angel
,
"
replied
the
old
beau
;
"
theparson
is
in
attendance
,
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
we
shall
be
manand
wife
.
<EOS>
""Have
you
<EOS>
no
scruple
in
taking
me
from
poor
Peter
Pokerich
?
"
said
thelady
.
<EOS>
"None
<EOS>
whatever
,
"
replied
the
old
beau
;
"
I
wish
the
little
perruquiercould
be
present
at
our
marriage
--
it
would
complete
his
mortification
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
there
's
no
saying
what
may
happen
,
"
replied
the
other
,
significantly
;
"
but
we
've
stood
chattering
here
long
enough
,
and
may
beobserved
.
<EOS>
"With
<EOS>
this
,
she
gave
her
hand
to
her
admirer
,
who
led
her
to
thecarriage
,
which
was
instantly
afterwards
heard
to
drive
off
.
<EOS>
At
the
samemoment
,
the
mercer
's
door
opened
,
and
the
fair
Thomasine
came
forth
.
<EOS>
"Are
<EOS>
they
gone
?
<EOS>
"
she
asked
.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
they
're
off
to
the
Fleet
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Kitty
<EOS>
Conway
gave
me
a
hint
to
follow
them
,
and
see
the
marriageperformed
.
<EOS>
Will
you
go?""Willingly
,
"
replied
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
And
hurrying
off
to
the
stairs
near
Westminster
-
bridge
,
they
took
aboat
,
and
ordered
the
waterman
to
row
as
quickly
as
he
could
toBlackfriars'-stairs
.
<EOS>
Luckily
the
tide
was
in
their
favour
,
and
thetransit
was
quickly
accomplished
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
carriage
containing
the
old
beau
,
and
the
actress
rolledrapidly
along
the
Strand
and
Fleet
-
street
,
and
drew
up
before
amean
-
looking
house
near
the
prison
.
<EOS>
A
lamp
threw
a
faint
glimmer
upon
asign
over
the
door
,
displaying
two
hands
joined
together
,
with
thewords--
'
MARRIAGES
PERFORMED
HERE
,
'
inscribed
beneath
it
.
<EOS>
Some
chairmenand
linkboys
were
standing
at
the
door
,
but
they
were
pushed
aside
bythe
old
beau
's
footman
.
<EOS>
As
Sir
Singleton
alighted
,
a
short
,
stout
,
red
-
faced
man
,
in
a
clerical
garb
,
issued
forth
.
<EOS>
This
was
Doctor
Gaynam
,
the
most
noted
of
the
Fleet
parsons
.
<EOS>
He
wore
a
rusty
cassock
andfull
-
bottomed
wig
,
filled
with
powder
,
instead
of
flour
,
whichcontrasted
strongly
with
his
purple
blotchy
face
,
and
nose
studded
withcarbuncles
.
<EOS>
"This
<EOS>
way
--
this
way
,
my
handsome
gentleman
and
fair
lady
,
"
said
DoctorGaynam
,
repeating
his
customary
formula
,
and
leading
the
pair
down
apassage
in
which
there
was
a
glass
door
,
giving
a
view
of
awedding
-
party
,
drinking
and
dancing
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
ready
for
you
,
"
he
added
,
opening
a
door
and
ushering
them
into
a
small
back
room
,
where
were
twoother
persons
,
who
turned
out
to
be
the
clerk
and
the
register
.
<EOS>
Thelatter
was
seated
at
a
desk
,
and
had
a
large
book
,
like
a
ledger
,
beforehim
.
<EOS>
"As
you
may
not
be
aware
of
the
practice
here
,
Sir
,
"
said
DoctorGayman
to
Sir
Singleton
,
"
I
will
take
the
liberty
to
inform
you
ofit
.
<EOS>
Our
rule
is
always
to
take
the
fees
beforehand
,
to
preventmisunderstanding
--
merely
to
prevent
misunderstanding
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
old
beau
immediately
produced
his
purse
,
and
gave
five
guineas
tothe
clergyman
,
a
couple
to
the
register
,
and
one
to
the
clerk
.
<EOS>
Thisliberality
produced
a
corresponding
effect
upon
the
parties
.
<EOS>
"I
have
the
honour
to
see
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
,
sir
,
I
believe
?
"
<EOS>
saidthe
register
.
<EOS>
"
Is
that
the
name
you
desire
to
be
married
by
?
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
significantly
.
<EOS>
"Certainly
,
"
said
the
old
beau
;
"
and
the
name
of
the
lady
is--""The
name
I
wish
to
be
married
by
is
written
down
on
this
paper
,
"
saidKitty
,
in
a
low
tone
,
delivering
a
leaf
torn
from
her
tablets
,
to
theregister
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
the
dear
,
sly
rogue
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Sir
Singleton
,
squeezing
her
hand
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Gayman
then
placed
the
parties
on
either
side
of
him
,
andcommenced
reading
the
service
.
<EOS>
The
register
gave
the
lady
away
,
and
atthe
same
time
placed
the
slip
of
paper
before
the
clergyman
,
whoproceeding
with
the
ceremony
gave
out
the
lady
's
name
as
Kitty
--
anappellation
which
somewhat
astounded
the
old
beau
.
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
repeatedthe
words
after
the
Doctor
,
and
so
did
the
lady
,
and
in
due
time
themarriage
was
completed
.
<EOS>
Just
as
the
ring
was
placed
on
the
bride'sfinger
,
two
other
persons
entered
the
room
;
but
as
they
kept
near
thedoor
,
and
as
Doctor
Gayman
supposed
them
to
be
another
couple
waitingtheir
turn
to
be
united
,
no
notice
was
taken
of
them
.
<EOS>
But
when
all
wasover
these
two
persons
advanced
and
proved
to
be
no
other
than
PeterPokerich
and
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
what
in
the
name
of
wonder
,
is
this
?
"
cried
the
old
beau
,
staringin
astonishment
.
<EOS>
"
The
likeness
is
marvellous
.
<EOS>
Are
there
two

<EOS>
But
no,--it

<EOS>
Who
the

"
replied
the
bride
,
unmasking
.
<EOS>
"Kitty

"
exclaimed
Sir

.
<EOS>
"Yes
<EOS>
,
Kitty
Conway
is
the
name

"
said
theregister

I

""We've

"And

added
the

"Well

"
cried
the
old

<EOS>
"
Egad

he
added
,
gazing
at
the

who
really
looked
very
beautiful

"
I

Kitty

Mr.

waved

kindly

<EOS>
"Upon

saidthe

with
something
like
a
sigh

<EOS>
"Oh

I
do

so

cried
Peter
;

there

""Now

VIII.--OF
<EOS>
THE
VISIT
OF
PHILIP
FREWIN
AND
DIGGS
TO
THE

,
AND
WHAT
THEYOBTAINED
FROM
HIM.Having
made
his
escape
from
the
watchmen
,
as
before
related
,
PhilipFrewin
ran
on
,
without
stopping
,
past
Charing
Cross
and
Whitehall
<EOS>
,
untilhe
reached
King
-
street
,
when
he
relaxed
his
pace
.
<EOS>
He
then
struck
into
OxYard
,
and
entered
the
Crown
Inn
,
within
it
,
pushing
past
the
waiter
,
whostared
aghast
at
his
blood
-
stained
appearance
--
though
broken
pates
werematters
of
common
occurrence
in
those
days
--
and
made
his
way
to
a
roomwhere
he
found
Diggs
seated
at
a
table
,
with
glasses
and
a
bowl
of
punchbefore
him
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
had
been
asleep
,
but
he
roused
himself
onPhilip
's
entrance
.
<EOS>
"Why
<EOS>
,
you
appear
to
have
come
off
the
worst
in
this
encounter
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
looking
at
him
.
<EOS>
"I
was
afraid
it
would
be
so
.
<EOS>
""Ay
,
devil
take
it
!
"
exclaimed
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
a
more
desperate
fellowthan
<EOS>
I
thought
him
.
<EOS>
We
should
have
done
well
enough
,
but
for
JacobPost
.
<EOS>
""Jacob
Post
!
"
<EOS>
repeated
Diggs--"how
came
he
there?"Philip
told
him
what
had
occurred
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
thought
it
an
ill
-
advised
proceeding
from
the
first
,
"
saidDiggs
,
as
the
other
concluded
his
recital
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
you
had
n't
chanced
tohear
that
he
was
going
to
sup
with
Kitty
Conway
.
<EOS>
This
would
never
havehappened!""Curse
him
!
"
cried
Philip
,
furiously
.
"
<EOS>
He
has
robbed
me
of
twomistresses
and
a
fortune
,
and
I
'll
be
revenged
on
him
--
deeplyrevenged!--I
swear
it!""It
is
vexatious
,
"
replied
Diggs
,
coolly
,
"
and
he
has
crossed
your
pathsomewhat
unluckily
.
<EOS>
Still
,
as
far
as
Kitty
Conway
is
concerned
,
I
thinkhe
did
you
a
service
in
taking
her
off
your
hands
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
repeat
,
I'msorry
you
meddled
with
him
to
-
night
.
<EOS>
You
have
enough
to
do
just
nowwithout
thinking
of
revenge
,
and
the
greatest
triumph
you
can
have
overhim
will
be
to
get
as
much
as
possible
from
your
uncle
Scarve
,
andthereby
reduce
Hilda
's
fortune
--
for
,
take
my
word
for
it
<EOS>
,
she
will
marryhim
when
the
old
man
dies
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
his
days
are
numbered
?
"
observed
Philip
.
<EOS>
"Undoubtedly
,
"
replied
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
Philip
!
<EOS>
if
you
had
but
played
yourcards
<EOS>
well
,
what
a
fortune
might
be
yours
!
<EOS>
It
would
have
repaired
allyour
folly
and
extravagance
.
<EOS>
""Come
,
come
,
Diggs
,
no
preaching
,
"
said
Philip
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
pastis
past
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
I
will
preach
,
as
you
call
it
,
"
cried
the
attorney
,
somewhatsharply
;
"
because
I
am
the
chief
sufferer
by
your
extravagance
.
<EOS>
You
havesquandered
a
noble
fortune
in
all
sorts
of
debauchery
--
have
been
aprofligate
and
a
gambler
;
and
are
now
little
better
than
a
sharper
.
<EOS>
Ihave
lost
some
thousands
by
you
,
and
I
must
and
will
be
repaid!""You
<EOS>
shall
be
repaid

"
replied
Philip
,
in
a
deprecatory
tone
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
how!--and
when
?
<EOS>
"
thundered
the
attorney--"how
,
and
when
,
sir?--answer
me
that?"Philip
was
silent
.
<EOS>
"
You
can
have
the
five
thousand
pounds
you
got
frommy
uncle
,
"
he
said
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"That
is
gone
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"Gone
!
<EOS>
"
cried
Philip--"why
,
you
offered
to
place
the
money
in
my
handsyourself!""I
<EOS>
have
found
a
better
use
for
it

said
Diggs
;
"
and
during
yourabsence
,
it
has
been
removed
.
<EOS>
"Philip
uttered
a
deep
imprecation
.
<EOS>
"I'll
tell
you
what
I
've
done
with
it
,
"
said
Diggs
;
<EOS>
"
I
've
given
it
to
amost
important
client
of
mine
--
an
agent
for
the
Jacobite
party
,
to
whoseuse
it
will
be
applied
.
<EOS>
Your
uncle
Scarve
is
a
Jacobite
,
and
I
told
himthis
money
would
be
employed
for
that
cause
,
and
gave
him
a
memorandumthat
if
it
prospered
he
should
receive
double
the
amount

<EOS>
Therefore
,
Iam
all
right
,
and
to
be
plain
with
you
,
I
never
meant
you
to
have
themoney

<EOS>
""You
are
a
consummate
scoundrel
,
Diggs
,
and
have
tricked
me
mostinfamously
,
"
said
Philip
,
angrily
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
such
thing
,
"
replied
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
say
you
have
,
"
cried
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
wasted
my
property
,
it
is
true;but
<EOS>
you
have
helped
me
to
do
it
by
your
extortionate
demands
.
<EOS>
You
haveraised
money
for
me
at
such
usurious
interest
,
that
you
have
beggared
mewhile
you
enriched
yourself
.
<EOS>
""Ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
<EOS>
ha
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Diggs
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
indulging
in
aloud
fit
of
merriment
.
<EOS>
"I'll
not
be
laughed
at
,
"
cried
Philip
,
striding
up
to
him
,
and
shakinghis
hand
in
his
face
;
"
leave
off
--
or
I
'll
make
you
.
<EOS>
""Sit
<EOS>
down
,
"
said
Diggs
,
calmly
;
"
you
'll
gain
nothing
by
passion
,
but
mayby
quietude
.
<EOS>
"
Accustomed
to
obey
him
,
Philip
sullenly
complied
.
<EOS>
"Now
<EOS>
listen
to
me
,
"
pursued
the
attorney
;
"
for
I
've
a
good
deal
to
tellyou
,
and
that
will
surprise
you
.
<EOS>
You
know
that
Randulph
Crew
's
fatherdied
greatly
embarrassed
,
and
that
Randulph
assigned
his
estates
to
thecreditors
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
what
of
that
?
"
asked
Philip
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
shall
hear
,
if
you
're
quiet
,
"
cried
Diggs
,
"
but
not
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Crew
's
principal
creditor
was
a
person
named
Isaacs
,
a
Jew
,
who
hadadvanced
him
money
at
most
usurious
interest
.
<EOS>
""As
<EOS>
you
have
done
to
me
,
"
observed
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
The
man
who
gets
into
suchhands
is
sure
to
be
ruined
.
<EOS>
""Cunning
as
he
was
,
"
pursued
Diggs
,
without
noticing
the
remark
,
"
Isaacsgot
into
difficulties
,
and
assigned
his
securities
to
his
chiefcreditor
,
Mr.
Nettleship
,
a
tallow
-
chandler
in
the
city
,
who
died
abouta
year
ago
,
and
whose
affairs
proving
greatly
embarrassed
,
thearrangement
of
them
was
committed
to
me
by
his
surviving
partner
,
Mr
.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
On
examining
the
claims
on
the
Crew
estates
,
I
found
theycould
not
be
legally
substantiated
,
and
<EOS>
therefore
,
instead
of
beingworth
sixty
thousand
pounds
,
as
he
imagined
,
the
securities
are
notworth
a
twentieth
part
of
that
amount
.
<EOS>
These
facts
being
made
known
tothe
agent
of
the
Jacobite
party
,
who
is
,
as
I
have
stated
,
a
client
ofmine
,
he
wished
to
get
these
papers
into
his
hands
,
and
Mr.
Scarve'smoney
has
been
appropriated
to
their
purchase
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
devil
it
has
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Philip
;
"
and
what
use
does
the
agentintend
to
make
of
them?""He
means
to
give
Randulph
back
his
property
,
provided
he
joins
theJacobite
cause
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
"
but
on
no
other
condition
.
<EOS>
Andin
my
opinion
it
will
never
be
fulfilled
.
<EOS>
But
what
is
more
,
your
uncleScarve
is
bound
under
a
heavy
penalty
to
give
his
daughter
to
RandulphCrew
.
<EOS>
But
neither
will
this
be
accomplished
,
unless
the
young
man
turnsJacobite
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
what
is
all
this
to
me
?
"
cried
Philip
;
"
or
rather
what
am
<EOS>
I
to
gainby
<EOS>
it?""That
depends
upon
yourself
,
"
replied
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
plain
you
can
nevermarry
your
cousin
Hilda
.
<EOS>
And
it
is
plain
also
that
if
Randulph
turnsJacobite
,
he
will
marry
her
,
and
obtain
his
property
again
.
<EOS>
You
have
,
therefore
,
no
hope
<EOS>
but
in
persuading
your
uncle
to
make
you
his
heir
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
do
you
think
that
can
be
accomplished
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
eagerly
.
<EOS>
"I
think
it
may
he
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
and
if
attempted
,
no
timeshould
be
lost
.
<EOS>
""Why
<EOS>
not
make
the
experiment
to
-
night
?
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
Jacob
is
out
ofthe
way
.
<EOS>
""That
is
something
certainly
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
but
the
hour
islate
.
<EOS>
""There
is
no
telling
what
may
happen
tomorrow
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"
Let
usmake
the
attempt
.
"After
<EOS>
a
little
consideration
,
Diggs
assented
;
and
Philip
retired
to
aninner
room
,
where
he
washed
the
sanguine
stains
from
his
face
,
mendedhis
broken
pate
with
a
patch
,
and
covered
all
with
an
old
scratch
wig
.
<EOS>
He
then
put
on
the
tattered
garb
he
was
accustomed
to
wear
on
his
visitsto
his
uncle
,
and
returning
to
Diggs
,
who
eyed
him
contemptuously
,
theyquitted
the
inn
by
a
private
door
,
and
proceeded
to
the
LittleSanctuary
.
<EOS>
Giving
a
loud
knock
,
they
were
answered
by
Mrs.
Clinton
,
whoseemed
greatly
surprised
,
and
by
no
means
pleased
,
to
see
them
,
andasked
what
they
wanted
.
<EOS>
Diggs
replied
that
he
had
business
with
Mr
.
Scarve
that
could
not
be
delayed
,
and
,
pushing
past
her
,
walked
down
thepassage
towards
the
parlour
,
followed
by
Philip
,
where
they
found
Hilda
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
seated
at
the
table
,
reading
that
sacred
volume
whichexercises
the
most
soothing
influence
on
the
mind
in
seasons
of
trouble;but
<EOS>
she
arose
on
hearing
their
approach
.
<EOS>
Diggs
repeated
what
he
hadstated
to
Mrs.
Clinton
,
and
asked
permission
to
walk
upstairs
to
themiser
's
room
.
<EOS>
"Your
business
must
be
important
if
it
can
not
be
postponed
tillto
-
morrow
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"It
can
not
be
postponed
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
in
yourfather
's
present
state
of
health
,
delays
might
be
dangerous
,
and
theurgency
of
the
case
must
plead
my
excuse
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
sir
,
if
you
are
resolved
to
see
him
,
"
replied
Hilda
,
"
you
willfind
him
in
his
own
room
sitting
by
the
fire
.
<EOS>
You
know
your
way
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
going
towards
the
stairs
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
need
not
expect
Jacob
Post
home
tonight
,
Hilda
,
"
observed
PhilipFrewin
;
"
he
has
got
shut
up
in
the
watchhouse
for
assisting
RandulphCrew
in
a
street
disturbance
.
<EOS>
I
saw
them
taken
off
myself
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Andchuckling
at
the
alarm
produced
by
this
intelligence
,
he
followed
theattorney
up
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
miser
was
seated
,
as
Hilda
had
stated
,
in
his
easy
chair
,
near
thefire
;
his
knees
thrust
into
the
scantily
-
supplied
grate
;
and
his
skinnyhands
extended
over
the
flame
.
<EOS>
A
farthing
candle
was
burning
on
thetable
.
<EOS>
On
hearing
the
door
open
,
he
cried
,
without
looking
round
,
in
aquerulous
tone--"So
<EOS>
you
've
come
at
last
,
Jacob
,
have
you
?
<EOS>
Where
have
youbeen

rascal

<EOS>
You
've
kept
me
up
very
late
,
for
I
could
n't
go
to

<EOS>
tillyou
came
home

<EOS>
I
'll
leave
you
nothing

atrick
again

nothing!""It
's
not

said
the
attorney
,
advancing--"it
's
me
--
Mr
.
Diggs
.
<EOS>
""Diggs
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
miser
,
looking
round
.
<EOS>
"
What
brings
you
here
atthis
time?--who
have
you
got
with
you?""Your
nephew
,
sir
--
<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
Philip
Frewin

"
replied
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
comeat
rather
an
unseasonable
hour
,
sir
,
but
I
thought
I
had
better
notdelay
my
visit

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
think
me
in

Diggs
--
<EOS>
I
know
you
do

<EOS>
and
that
's
the
reason
ofyour
coming

"
said
the
miser
;
"
everybody
fancies
that
I
'm
going
to
die;even
Abel
Beechcroft
<EOS>
paid
me
a
visit
t'other
night
to
tell
me
so
.
<EOS>
Butthough
<EOS>
I
'm
ill
enough

God

it
's
not
all
over

<EOS>
I
maycome

Diggs
--
may
come
round

<EOS>
But
to
your
business
.
<EOS>
""My
business
relates
to
your
nephew
,
Mr.
Scarve
,
"
said
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
Iknow
you
are
much
too
strong
minded
to
fear
the
approach
of
death
;
andthough
I
trust
my
apprehensions
may
prove
groundless
,
I
hold
it
my
dutyto
tell
you
that
I
consider
your
condition
precarious
.
<EOS>
You
may
getbetter--""But
<EOS>
the
probability
is
I
shall
not

"
interrupted
the
miser
,
with
aghastly
grin
,
"
that
's
what
you
mean
to
say
,
sir
.
<EOS>
Go
on
.
<EOS>
""I
wish
to
know
your
sentiments
in
reference
to
the
proposed
alliancebetween
Mr.
Frewin
and
your
daughter
,
"
pursued
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
Ifanything
should
happen
to
you
,
is
it
your
wish
that
she
should
marry
himor
Randulph
Crew?""She
shall
never
marry
Randulph
Crew
!
"
shrieked
the
miser
.
<EOS>
"
I'lldisinherit
her
rather
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
your
property
away
from
her
if
she
disobeys
your
injunctions
andweds
him
--
that
will
answer
the
purpose
,
"
said
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
--
I
will
,
"
rejoined
the
miser
;
"
and
what
is
more
,
I
will
leave
itfrom
her
if
she
does
not
marry
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
""If
such
is
your
intention
,
the
will
had
better
be
drawn
up
at
once,"said
<EOS>
the
attorney
;
"
I
will
get
writing
materials
,
and
prepare
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
miser
assented
,
and
turned
his
head
thoughtfully
towards
the
fire
,
while
Diggs
took
up
the
candle
,
and
went
down
stairs
for
pen
and
ink
.
<EOS>
Though
longing
to
address
his
uncle
,
Philip
did
not
dare
to
do
so
,
forfear
of
disturbing
the
present
favourable
position
of
things
.
<EOS>
The
nextmoment
,
Diggs
returned
,
and
sitting
down
at
the
table
,
commenced
drawingup
the
will
.
<EOS>
The
miser
watched
the
progress
of
his
rapid
pen
in
silentcuriosity
,
and
Philip
Frewin
did
his
best
to
hide
the
intense
interesthe
took
in
the
proceedings
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
attorney
completed
his
task
,
and
having
glanced
it
over
,
turned
to
the
miser
,
and
commenced
readingit
.
<EOS>
The
effect
of
the
instrument
,
which
was
most
strongly
worded
,
was
toplace
Hilda
completely
in
the
power
of
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
"Its
<EOS>
just
what
I
wished
,
"
said
the
miser
,
as
Diggs
finished
;
"
I
'll
signit
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
he
tottered
to
the
table
,
and
sat
down
in
the
seat
relinquished
forhim
by
Diggs
,
who
placed
the
will
before
him
,
and
a
pen
in
his
tremblingfingers
,
the
door
was
opened
,
and
Hilda
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
Though
greatlystartled
by
her
appearance
at
this
critical
juncture
,
the
attorneycommanded
himself
as
well
as
he
could
,
and
said
hastily
to
themiser--"Sign
it
,
sir
<EOS>
--
sign
it
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
latter
would
not
be
deprived
of
his
triumph
.
<EOS>
He
looked
up
at
hisdaughter
,
and
said
,
"
I
'm
about
to
put
an
effectual
bar
to
your
marriagewith
Randulph
Crew

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
do
you
forget
your
solemn
contract
with
his
father
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Will
<EOS>
you
not
fulfil
that?""That
contract
is
little
better
than
a
moral
obligation
upon
Mr

Scarve
,
"
said
Diggs
;
"
it
can
not
be
enforced
--
certainly
not
upon
hisrepresentatives

<EOS>
""Father
,
"
said
Hilda
,
stepping
forward
,
and
laying
her
hand
upon
thewill
,
"
I
beseech
you
not
to
sign
this
paper

<EOS>
You
are
not
sufficientlyyourself
to
do
so

it
is
infamous
in
Mr.
Diggs
to
practice
on
youthus

<EOS>
Keep
it
by
you

and
sign
it
if
you
will

when
you
have
wellconsidered
it;--but
not

not

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
think
me
worse
than
I

"
said
the
miser
,
regarding
herfixedly
;
"

I
will
undeceive
you

<EOS>
It
is
true
that
at
times
my
mindwanders

and
my
memory
fails
me
;
but
I
am
perfectly
myself
at
thismoment

perfectly
so

<EOS>
In
proof
of
it

I
will
tell
you
what
I

about

<EOS>
I
am
resolved

as
I

I

taken

""You

rejoined
Hilda
;

I
deny

""Mark

"You

<EOS>
Cripps
'
plan
of
inveigling
Mr.
Rathbone
into
consenting
to
hismarriage
with
the
widow
,
threatened
to
be
defeated
by
the
precipitationof
the
lady
herself
,
who
now
that
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
it
,
declaimed
strongly
against
the
delay
,
and
began
to
tax
him
with
coolingin
his
ardour
towards
her
.
<EOS>
The
valet
protested
to
the
contrary
;
but
allwould
not
do
,
and
he
began
to
fear
he
should
be
compelled
to
sacrificethe
three
thousand
pounds
,
which
went
very
much
against
hisinclinations
.
<EOS>
Luckily
,
while
he
was
in
this
dilemma
,
the
duel
occurredbetween
his
master
and
Randulph
,
and
the
wound
which
the
latter
hadreceived
,
immediately
furnished
him
with
a
pretext
for
absenting
himselfuntil
he
should
have
time
to
mature
his
plans
.
<EOS>
He
felt
too
secure
of
hisprize
to
be
under
any
apprehension
of
being
supplanted
by
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
dispatched
Antoine
,
the
French
valet
,
who
was
in
hisconfidence
,
and
to
whom
he
had
promised
a
very
handsome
reward
,
in
caseof
his
success
,
to
the
widow
with
a
message
,
stating
that
he
had
beenwounded
in
a
duel
,
and
could
not
leave
his
room
for
some
days
,
but
assoon
as
he
could
get
out
he
would
pay
her
a
visit
.
<EOS>
On
receiving
this
distressing
intelligence
,
Mrs.
Nettleship
uttered
ascream
,
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
,
and
it
required
the
combinedassistance
of
Antoine
and
a
female
servant
,
with
abundance
of
rosa
-
solisand
ratafia
,
to
bring
her
to
herself
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
Mr.
Rathboneentered
the
room
,
and
expressing
great
anxiety
to
know
what
was
thematter
,
was
informed
of
it
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
where
is
the
dear
man
wounded
?
"
asked
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
faintly
.
<EOS>
"Dans
<EOS>
le

--
in

arm
,

,
"
replied
Antoine
.
<EOS>
"
Mais

<EOS>
You
shall
see

again

<EOS>
My
master
sends
his
love
to
you
,
and
bids
mesay
his
wound
is
not
so
deep
as
that
you
have
inflicted
on
him
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
dear
soul
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
<EOS>
pathetically,"It
's
all
out
,
now
,
"
said
Mr.
Rathbone
,
to
the
widow
;
"
this
is
hisFrench
valet
.
<EOS>
I
told
you
it
was
Mr.
Willars
all
the
time

<EOS>
""Certainement

said
Antoine
;
"

""He

Mr.

the

bowing

<EOS>
"I

<EOS>

the

perplexed
.
<EOS>
"Yes

"
reiterated
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"Pardon
,
Monsieur
,
<EOS>
but
may
I
enquire
why
you
ask
de
question
?
<EOS>
"
rejoinedAntoine
.
<EOS>
"Because
<EOS>
we
've
had
a
visit
from
a
person
of
that
name
,
"
replied
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
,
winking
at
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
A

very
like
your
master

""Mais

""No

I
do

I

deceiving

.
<EOS>
""Deceiving

<EOS>
exclaimed
the
valet
;
"
impossible

<EOS>
Mr.

isa

of
too
much

<EOS>
He
would
never

Sare

He

""For

then

Mons

<EOS>
Ontwine

"
cried
Mr

<EOS>
Rathbone
,
alarmed
.
<EOS>
"
I
only
meant
to
say
that
Mr.
Willars
has
passedhimself
off
as
his

as
Mr.

<EOS>
""Quoi

exclaimed
Antoine
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.

off
as

isthat
<EOS>
it?""Yes

,
that

replied
Mr.

;
"
but
we
smokedhim
directly

we
could
n't

him
for

<EOS>
replied
Antoine
,
joining
in
thelaugh--"impossible!""There
could
be
no
mistake
in
your
case
,
Monsieur
Ontwine
,
"
pursued
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
;
"
but
with
Mr.
Willars
it
's
a
different
matter
.
<EOS>
""Very
different

"
replied
Antoine
,
gravely
,
and
muttering
tohimself--"bete

<EOS>
he
added
aloud
,
to
Mrs.

.
"
<EOS>
Has

me
with

how

I

replied
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
I
might

<EOS>
""Mr
.
<EOS>
Villiers
will
be
bien
flatte
<EOS>
,
I
'm
sure
,
"
replied
the
valet--"but
hecould
not
tink
of
such
a
ting
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
anybody
else
,
"
replied
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
It
would
be
highly
improper
.
<EOS>
No
,
he
'll
soon
be
well
,
and
will
come
and
pay
his
respects
to
you
.
<EOS>
""His
<EOS>
first
visit
will
be
rendered
to
you
,
madame

"
said
the
valet
;
and
,
with
a
profound
bow
,
he
took
his
leave
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Antoine
was
gone
,
Mr.
Rathbone
ordered
the
maid
out
of
theroom
,
and
took
a
chair
near
Mrs.
Nettleship
.
<EOS>
"My
<EOS>
dear
Mrs.
N.
<EOS>
,
"
he
began
,
"
I
'm
glad
to
find
things
in
such
a
goodtrain
with
your
beau
.
<EOS>
""You're
<EOS>
very
obleeging
to
say
so
,
Mr.
R.
,
"
replied
the
widow
,
"
and
it'smore
than
could
be
expected
from
you
.
<EOS>
""Now
<EOS>
my
dear
Mrs.
N.
,
"
pursued
Rathbone
,
"
I
'm
going
to
act
as
a
friendto
you
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
deceive
yourself
.
<EOS>
You
fancy
Mr.
Willars
in
love
with
you
,
but
I
'll
tell
you
the
truth,--he
's
only
in
love
with
your
fortune
.
<EOS>
""You're
<EOS>
his
rival
,
Mr.
Rathbone
,
"
said
the
widow
,
turning
up
her
nose
.
<EOS>
"No
,
I
ai
n't
,
"
replied
the
other
;
"
and
if
you
want
to
see
whether
heloves
you

your
fortune
best
,
tell
him
what
I
'm
going
to
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Youmust
know
,
"
he
added
in
an
altered
tone--"that
in
winding
up
your
poorhusband
's
affairs
<EOS>
,
I
find
instead
of
his
being
the
wealthy
man
he
wassupposed
,
that
he
died
greatly
in
debt
.
<EOS>
""In
debt
!
"
screamed
the
widow
,
pushing
back
the
chair
.
<EOS>
"
In
debt

Mr.
R.!""Don't
faint

my

Mrs.

Mr.

<EOS>
"
There
is
n't
time
forit
<EOS>
just
now,--and
<EOS>
there
's
nobody

me
to
see
you

<EOS>
Your
case
standsthus:--You
have
nothing
--
nay
,
less
than
nothing
--
for
all
your
husband'sproperty
will
be
seized
.
<EOS>
I
've
kept
the
secret
safe
enough
to
thismoment
,
and
I
'll
keep
it
till
you
're
married
,
if
I
can
.
<EOS>
Now
,
perhaps
,
you
begin
to
perceive
my
motive
for
giving
you
up
so
easily
,
and
forencouraging
the
beau
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do
--
<EOS>
I
do
,
"
sighed
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
But
what
's
to
be
done
,
for
I
begin
tothink
with
you
,
that
if
Mr.
Willars
finds
this
out
,
he
may
run
off?""He
never
shall
find
it
out
,
"
replied
Mr.
Rathbone
,
"
if
you
'll
promiseto
pay
me
the
three
thousand
pounds
to
be
forfeited
by
you
in
case
ofyour
breaking
your
marriage
contract
with
me
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
how
todo
it
.
<EOS>
He
believes
you
're
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!--and
<EOS>
I'vetaken
care
to
favour
the
notion
--
<EOS>
he
!
<EOS>
he!--you
shall
give
him
the
wholeof
your

,
and
make
him
settle
five
thousand
pounds
of
his
ownupon
you
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
your
trustee
;
and
the
money
must
be
paid
into
myhands
.
<EOS>
Thus
you
'll
get
a
young
gay
husband
,
and
saddle
him
with
yourdebts
.
<EOS>
""I
ca
n't
do
it
,
"
said
the
widow
;
"
I
tremble
at
the
thought
of
suchdreadful
deception

<EOS>
Why
,
it
's
little
better
than
swindling

<EOS>
I
'll
explainmy
situation
to
him

throw
myself
upon
his
compassion

<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
you
'll
lose
him
as
sure

theother
.
<EOS>
"Well

I
place
myself
in
your

said
the
widow
;

it
's
a

<EOS>
""We
must
lose
no

Mr

My

<EOS>
and
he
took
hisdeparture
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
<EOS>
Nettleship
took
to
her
bed
for
a
couple
of
days
,
at
the
end
ofwhich
time
she
grew
more
composed
,
had
another
interview
with
Mr

Rathbone
,
requested
him
to
shew
her
her
husband
's
books
,
and
havingsatisfied
herself
that
his
statement
was
correct
,
promised
to
follow
hisinstructions
implicitly
.
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
a
fortnight
,
Mr.
Cripps
presented
himself
to
her
.
<EOS>
Helooked
very
pale
,
for
he
had
been
drinking
freely
the
night
before
withthe
Duke
of
Doncaster
's
gentleman
,
but
this
circumstance
gave
himadditional
interest
in
the
eyes
of
Mrs.
Nettleship
.
<EOS>
As
preconcerted
,
soon
after
his
arrival
,
Mr.
Rathbone
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"Ah
,
Mr.
Willars
!
"
said
the
latter--"Glad
to
see
you
out
again

<EOS>
Hope
youkilled
your

ha!--I've
been
thinking
a

""I

replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"Before
I
reply
,
I
must
ask
Mrs.
Nettleship
one
or
two
questions,"replied
<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone
"
Is
it
your
intention
to
marry
Mr.

Mr.

replied
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"
However
I
'll
answerit

<EOS>
It
is

""And

how

"
rejoined
Mr.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
doubt
Mr.
Willars
will
make
anexcellent
husband

but
you
are
bound
to
take
care
of
your

<EOS>
""I
sha

Mrs.

""You

Mr.

rapturously
;

if

by
representing
hercircumstances
as
very
different
from
what
they
are
,
"
interrupted
Mr
.
Rathbone
.
<EOS>
"
She
told
me
she
would
do
so
.
<EOS>
But
I
do
n't
think
it
a
fairjoke
;
and
I
therefore
warn
you
against
it
.
<EOS>
""It
might
have
startled
me
a
little
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
,
forcing
alaugh
;
"
but
it
would
have
made
no
difference
in
my
sentiments
orintentions
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
Mr.
Rathbone
,
since
disinterestedness
is
the
orderof
the
day
,
you
,
I
hope
,
will
imitate
the
good
example
set
you
by
Mrs
.
Nettleship
,
and
excuse
her
the
three
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
I
'll
now
tell
youfrankly
that
my
motive
for
pretending
to
be
a
valet
was
to
trick
you
outof
your
consent
.
<EOS>
But
finding
I
am
dealing
with
a
liberal
,
straightforward
gentleman
,
I
therefore
think
it
the
best
as
well
as
themost
honest
course
to
ask
you
to
remit
the
penalty
.
<EOS>
You
can
not
fairlyclaim
it
without
forfeiting
both
the
lady
's
and
my
good
opinion
;
and
I'msure
you
do
n't
desire
to
do
that
.
<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
tell
you
what
I
'll
do
,
"
replied
Mr.
Rathbone
,
putting
on
an
air
ofcandour
equal
to
that
of
the
valet
;
"
if
you
'll
agree
to
settle
fivethousand
pounds
on
Mrs.
N.
,
I
will
give
up
the
contract
.
<EOS>
""Settle
<EOS>
five
thousand
pounds
!
"
exclaimed
Mr.
Cripps
,
rather
staggered
.
<EOS>
"No
<EOS>
great
sum
to
a
man
of
fortune
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Mr.
Rathbone
;
"
she
bringsyou
twenty
times
the
amount
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
herself
,
"
insinuated
the
widow
.
<EOS>
"I'll
act
as
her
trustee
,
"
pursued
<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone--"it'll
be
a
very
prettypresent
to
her
.
<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
sure
you
wo
nt
hesitate
,
dearest
,
"
whispered
the
widow
,
"
since
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
's
so
kind
.
<EOS>
""No
--
<EOS>
no
,
I
ca
n't
hesitate
,
"
stammered
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
but
just
now
all
mymoney
's
locked
up
,
'
<EOS>
pon
rep
.
""Don't
let
that
be
an
obstacle
,
"
said
Mr.
Rathbone--"you
shall
give
me
abond
for
the
amount
--
<EOS>
that
will
do
just
as
well
.
<EOS>
""Ah
!
<EOS>
if
you
're
satisfied
with
that
,
I
'm
quite
content
,
"
returned
Mr
.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
you
required
the
money
down
,
and
that
would
haverather
inconvenienced
me
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
then
,
we
had
better
settle
the
matter
at
once
,
"
said
<EOS>
Mr
.
Rathbone--"I'll
go
and
fetch
my
attorney
,
who
shall
prepare
the
bond
andsettlement
,
and
then
I
'll
deliver
the
contract
to
Mrs.
Nettleship
<EOS>
,
afterwhich
there
'll
be
no
further
obstacle
to
your
union
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
quitted
the
room
,
and
the
lovers
were
left
alone
together
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
felt
very
easy
;
and
at
last
the
widow
proposed
anadjournment
to
the
dining
-
room
,
where
refreshments
were
prepared
,
and
afew
glasses
of
wine
restored
Mr.
Cripps
to
his
usual
confidence
andspirits
.
<EOS>
About
two
hours
afterwards
,
Mr.
Rathbone
returned
,
bringing
with
him
Mr
.
Diggs
.
<EOS>
Both
the
settlement
and
the
bond
were
prepared
.
<EOS>
Not
till
that
moment
did
it
occur
to
Mr.
Cripps
that
he
was
about
tocommit
a
forgery
.
<EOS>
He
gazed
at
the
deeds
,
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do;then
,
hastily
snatching
up
a
pen
,
he
signed
them
in
his
master
's
name
,
and
in
a
signature
so
nearly
resembling
Mr.
Villier
's
,
that
it
couldscarcely
be
detected
from
it
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
Mr.
Rathbone
delivered
a
paperto
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
and
took
his
departure
with
Diggs
.

CHAPTER

MR

<EOS>
CRIPPS
'S
MARRIAGE
WITH
THE
WIDOW
WAS
INTERRUPTED.One
morning
,
about
a
week
after
this
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
while
busied
in
thebutler
's
pantry
,
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
his
nephew
,
who
struttedin
very
unceremoniously
,
and
seated
himself
,
according
to
custom
,
on
theedge
of
the
table
.
<EOS>
He
was
finer
dressed
than
usual
,
being
equipped
inone
of
his
master
's
best
suits
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
nunks
,
how
are
you
,
old
fellow
?
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
This
is
the
last
visitI
shall
pay
you
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
""Glad
to
hear
it
<EOS>
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
,
drily
.
<EOS>
"Your
wits
were
ever
dull
,
nunks
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
and
youmisapprehend
me
.
<EOS>
I
mean
that
when
I
visit
you
next
,
it
will
be
in
a
giltcoach
,
like
my
<EOS>
master's
.
""Heaven
save
us
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
the
butler--"what
new
folly
is
the
laddreaming
of?""You
shall
hear
presently
,
nunks
,
"
replied
the
valet
;
"
but
I
'm
quiteexhausted
with
my
walk
;
give
me
a
cup
of
ale
,
if
you
have
no
wine
.
<EOS>
Notbad
tipple
,
'
pon
rep
!
"
<EOS>
he
added
,
tossing
off
a
glass
poured
out
for
him
.
<EOS>
"I'm
going
to
be
married
,
nunks
.
<EOS>
""What
,
to
that
foolish
widow
?
"
cried
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"I'm
about
to
marry
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
and
I
willthank
you
to
speak
more
respectfully
of
one
to
whom
you
will
soon
be
sonearly
related
.
<EOS>
I
am
to
be
married
to
her
on
Thursday
next
,
and
I
amcome
to
invite
you
to
the
wedding

<EOS>
She
has
fifty
thousand
pounds
,
andit
's
all
to
be
mine
--
no
settlement
--
no
tying
up
--
no

--
fifty
thousand
pounds
!
<EOS>
what
do
you
think
of
that
,
nunks
,
<EOS>
eh?""I'm
lost
in
astonishment
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
;
"
but
take
care
of
it
<EOS>
whenyou
get
it
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
fool
it
away
.
<EOS>
""Leave
<EOS>
me
to
manage
my
own
concerns
,
nunks
,
"
rejoined
the
valet
.
<EOS>
"
I'lltake
another
glass
of
ale
,
"
he
added
,
helping
himself
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
and
where
is
the
wedding
to
take
place
?
"
asked
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
my
master
's
,
"
replied
Mr.
Cripps
.
<EOS>
"
There
'll
be
a
dinner
,
and
a
ballafter
it
,
and
a
supper
after
that
.
<EOS>
You
'll
come
,
of
course
;
but
youmustn't
come
as
a
servant
.
<EOS>
You
must
lay
aside
your
livery
,
and
put
onone
of
Trussell

suits
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
I

be
in
my

,
depend
upon
it
,
"
repliedMr
.
<EOS>
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
But
pray
,
does
your
master
know
what
's
going
to
take
placein
his
house?--has
<EOS>
he
given
you
<EOS>
leave
to
have
this
dinner

,
andsupper
,
<EOS>
eh?""Pshaw
!
<EOS>
nunks
,
do
you
think
I
'd
ask
him
?
"
rejoined
Mr.
Cripps
,
helpinghimself
to
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
"
He
's
going
to
Newmarket
on
Wednesday
withSir
Bulkeley
Price
,
and
they
do
n't
return
till
Friday
.
<EOS>
And
now
,
nunks,"pursued
Mr.
Cripps
,
fortifying
himself
with
another
pinch
of
snuff
,
"
Iwant

<EOS>
I

the
butler
.
<EOS>
"Nay

I

rejoined
Mr.
Cripps--"I

cried
the

.
<EOS>
"
I

and
if

I
would

<EOS>
""Well
,
fifty
I
must
have

"
said
Mr.
Cripps
;
"
I
ca
n't
do
with
less
.
<EOS>
Forty
--
you
shake
your
head
--
thirty
--
twenty,--I'm
obliged
to
come
downlike
an
auctioneer
.
<EOS>
You
are
devoid
of
all
natural

,
nunks
;
morestony

hearted
than
Brutus
,
to
refuse
your

's
son
twenty
pounds
forthree
days
,
and
perhaps
,
prevent
him
from
settling
for
life
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
,
moved
by
this
appeal
,
"
I
will
lend
you
twentyguineas
,
nephew
,
but
you
must
repay
me
.
<EOS>
It
's
the
savings
of

<EOS>
""Repay
<EOS>
you

that
I

replied
Mr.
Cripps
,
embracing
him
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
repay
you
with
enormous
interest

<EOS>
""I
do
n't
want

"
replied
the
butler
;
"
I
shall
be
well
contentwith
the
principal

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
opening
a
drawer
in
the
cupboard
,
he
took
out
of
it
a
small
leatherbag
containing
twenty
guineas
,
which
he
counted
,
and
gave
to
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
"Twenty
thousand
thanks

said
Mr.

,
pocketing
the
gold;"and
rely
upon
being
punctually

<EOS>
By

the

I

<EOS>
What
do
you
get
from
old
Abel?""Never

what

"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
've
no
idea
ofleaving
him

<EOS>
""No

"
rejoined
the
other
;
"
it
's
no
degradation
to

<EOS>
I

Twelve

<EOS>
Be

<EOS>
My

place
shall

left
open
for
a
fewdays
,
in

you
should
change
your
mind
about
it
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
took
his
leave
in
high
glee
,
while
Mr.
Jukes
,
as
he
shut
the
doorafter
him
,
said
dolefully
to
<EOS>
himself:--"I'm
afraid
I
've
done
wrong
in
lending
the
money
.
<EOS>
However
he
's
mysister
's
son
.
<EOS>
"Having
<EOS>
now
got
a
larger
sum
in
his
pocket
than
he
had
ever
had
before
,
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
felt
strongly
tempted
to
try
his
luck
at
the
gaming
-
table
,
but
he
resisted
the
temptation
.
<EOS>
"No
,
no
,
"
he
thought
,
"
it
wo
nt
do
to
hazard
this
money
.
<EOS>
It
's
everythingto
me
just
now
.
<EOS>
I
shall
have
plenty
to
spare
for
play
shortly
.
<EOS>
"On
<EOS>
his
way
home
,
Mr.
Cripps
called
upon
Peter
Pokerich
,
and
invited
himand
the
fair
Thomasine
to
the
wedding
,
the
one
in
the
capacity
ofgroomsman
,
and
the
other
in
that
of
bridesmaid
;
and
the
invitation
wasdelightedly
accepted
by
both
.
<EOS>
A
great
load
was
taken
from
the
valet
's
mind
on
the
following
morning
,
as
he
helped
his
master
into
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
's
carriage
,
and
saw
himstart
,
as
he
supposed
,
for
Newmarket
.
<EOS>
Not
a
moment
was
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
Every
preparation
that
could
be
madewithout
exciting
suspicion
,
had
been
made
beforehand
--
but
now
Mr.
Crippsset
to
work
in
earnest
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
Cocoa
Tree
and
ordered
,
in
hismaster
's
name
,
a
first
-
rate
dinner
with
abundance
of
the
finest
wine
,
tobe
sent
in
on
the
following
day
.
<EOS>
He
next
engaged
a
band
of
musicians
forthe
ball
,
and
ordered
fruits
,
confectionary
,
and
pastry
,
for
the
supper
.
<EOS>
His
fellow
servants
,
who
were
all
of
course
,
in
the
secret
,
and
to
whomhe
had
promised
handsome
rewards
as
soon
as
he
should
be
put
inpossession
of
the
widow
's
fortune
,
assisted
him
in
his
preparations
forthe
fete
.
<EOS>
It
was
arranged
,
that
the
ceremony
should
take
place
in
theupper
chamber
,
where
Randulph
first
breakfasted
with
the
beau
,
and
theclergyman
selected
to
perform
it
<EOS>
was
Doctor
Gaynam
.
<EOS>
Thus
nothing
seemedwanting
on
the
valet
's
part
to
complete
the
matter
;
and
late
onWednesday
evening
he
went
to
Billiter
Square
,
to
tell
Mrs.
Nettleshipthat
all
was
ready
.
<EOS>
After
a
brief
visit
,
he
took
a
tender
adieu
of
her
,
saying
,
as
he
squeezed
her
hand
at
parting
,
"
We
shall
meet
to
-
morrow
,
topart
no
more!"The
next
morning
,
betimes
,
Mr.
Cripps
placed
himself
under
the
hands
ofAntoine
,
who
proceeded
to
array
him
in
a
magnificent
suit
,
which
hadnever
been
worn
by
his
master
,
it
having
only
been
sent
home
the
nightbefore
by
Desmartins
.
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
a
coat
of
crimson
-
embossed
velvet
,
richly
-
laced
with
gold
,
breeches
of
the
same
material
,
and
a
white
satinwaistcoat
flowered
with
gold
.
<EOS>
To
these
were
added
pink
silk
hose
rolledabove
the
knee
,
superb
diamond
buckles
,
a
point
-
lace
cravat
,
and
hismaster
's
handsomest
Ramillies
periwig
,
which
had
been
dressed
by
PeterPokerich
.
<EOS>
Nearly
three
hours
were
expended
in
thus
attiring
him
;
andwhen
all
was
completed
,
Antoine
declared
that
his
master
had
neverlooked
half
so
well
,
a
sentiment
in
which
Mr.
Cripps
,
as
he
complacentlysurveyed
himself
in
the
cheval
-
glass
,
entirely
concurred
.
<EOS>
A
little
before
twelve
,
Peter
Pokerich
and
the
fair
Thomasine
arrived
.
<EOS>
The
lady
was
dressed
in
white
and
silver
,
with
a
fly
-
cap
with
longlappets
,
and
looked
so
excessively
pretty
,
that
Mr.
Cripps
could
nothelp
wishing
she
had
had
Mrs.
Nettleship
's
fortune
,
and
he
had
been
herlover
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
welcoming
them
,
and
passing
some
high
-
flown
compliments
onthe
fair
Thomasine
's
charms
,
Mr.
Jukes
was
shewn
into
the
room
;
and

was

nephew

<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
Antoine
announced
that
the
bride
had
arrived
,
andMr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
hurried
downstairs
to
meet
her
.
<EOS>
Mrs
.
Nettleship
,
who
had
bestowed
more
than
ordinary
pains
upon
herperson
,
wore
a
yellow
satin
sack
,
embroidered
with
little
dots
of
gold
.
<EOS>
She
had
large
pearl

-
rings
,
a
garnet
necklace
,
and
a
diamondsolitaire
.
<EOS>
Her
complexion
,
which
was
naturally
rather
high
had
beencorrected
by
white
French
powder
,
and
was
further
set
off
by
abundanceof
little
patches
on
her
cheeks
,
neck
,
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
She
carried
abeautiful
Indian
fan
,
the
handle
of
which
was
ornamented
with
preciousstones
.
<EOS>
She
had
arrived
in
great
state
,
a
gilt
chariot
,
lined
with
pale
bluesatin
,
hired
for
her
from
a
coach
-
maker
,
by
Mr.
Rathbone
,
having
formedher
conveyance
;
and
she
was
attended
by
a
couple
of
footmen
out
ofplace
,
likewise
hired
for
the
occasion
,
habited
in
superb
liveries
ofsky
blue
cloth
trimmed
with
silver
,
with
silver

knots
,
andpoint
d'Espagne
hats
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Rathbone
,
who
had
accompanied
her
in
thecarriage
,
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
purple
velvet
laced
with
gold
.
<EOS>
Addressing
a
hundred
pretty
compliments
to
the
bride
,
who
was
almostbewildered
by
the
grandeur
she
beheld
around
,
and
who
could
not
helpexchanging
significant
glances
with
Mr.
Rathbone
,
Mr.
Cripps
led
herup
-
stairs
,
where
her
wonder
increased
at
every
step
.
<EOS>
The
two
long
-
earedspaniels
and
the
macaw
enchanted
her
,
but
she
actually
screamed
delighton
beholding
the
monkey
,
in
his
little
scarlet
coat
and
bag
-
wig
.
<EOS>
Coffee
,
chocolate
,
and
champagne
,
were
then
handed
round
by
Antoine
andthe
page
;
and
while
this
was
going
on
,
the
clergyman
and
his
assistantwere
announced
.
<EOS>
Dr.
Gaynam
had
a
much
more
respectable
appearance
thanwhen
he
officiated
at
the
marriage
of
Sir
Singleton
Spinke
.
<EOS>
He
wasdressed
in
his
full
canonicals
,
and
wore
a
well
-
powdered
full
-
bottomedwig
,
which
Peter
Pokerich
would
not
have
disdained
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Mr.
Cripps
had
seated
himself
by
the
bride
on
one
of
thecouches
,
and
was
talking
very
tenderly
to
her
,
when
he
perceived
hisuncle
approach
Mr.
Rathbone
,
as
if
with
the
intention
of
addressing
him
.
<EOS>
He
instantly
arose
,
and
taking
the
latter
aside
,
whispered
a
few
wordsto
him
,
and
then
having
accomplished
his
object
,
which
was
to
preventany
communication
between
him
and
Mr.
Jukes
,
told
the
clergyman
toproceed
with
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
Doctor
Gaynam
was
sipping
a
glass
of
usquebaugh
,
but
he
hastily
gulpedit
down
,
and
declared
himself
perfectly
ready
.
<EOS>
He
then
took
aprayer
-
book
from
the
clerk
,
and
stationed
himself
between
the
windows
,
motioning
the
others
to
take
their
places
before
him
.
<EOS>
All
was
soon
arranged
.
<EOS>
Peter
Pokerich
and
the
fair
Thomasine
stood
nearthe
bride
;
Mr.
Rathbone
near
the
bridegroom
;
Antoine
behind
him
;
whilethe
group
was
completed
by
the
two
Africans
,
who
had
mounted
a
settee
inthe
corner
to
obtain
a
full
view
of
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
The
page
was
on
thefloor
keeping
the
dogs
quiet
,
who
were
quarrelling
with
the
monkey
,
andbiting
its
tail
.
<EOS>
Just
as
Dr.
Gaynam
had
opened
his
book
,
and
uttered
a
preliminary
cough
,
a
noise
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
Mr.
Cripps
,
turning
to
see
what
wasthe
matter
,
beheld
it
open
,
and
admit
his
master!The
valet
's
alarm
was
communicated
to
the
whole
assemblage
.
<EOS>
Antoine
,
whohad
retreated
behind
Rathbone
,
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
lifted
up
hishands
in
affright
.
<EOS>
The
two
Africans
exchanged
glances
,
and
all
eyes
weredirected
towards
the
beau
,
who
,
with
angry
looks
,
and
grasping
hisclouded
cane
,
marched
towards
the
valet
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
by
LadyBrabazon
,
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
and
Trussell
Beechcroft
.
<EOS>
Lady
Brabazon
wasattended
by
her
black
page
,
leading
her
dog
by
a
ribband
,
and
thisarrival
excited
the
anger
of
one
of
the
spaniels
,
whose
furious
barkingset
the
macaw
screaming
.
<EOS>
Mr

<EOS>
Cripps
presented
a
very
chop
-
fallen
appearance
.
<EOS>
All
his
assurancedeserted
him
.
<EOS>
His
hands
dropped
to
his
side
,
and
he
scarcely
dared
tomeet
his
master
's
angry
gaze
.
"Rascal

"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Villiers
,
"
I
have
at

fairly
detected

<EOS>
I'llteach

screamed
Mrs.

dropping
a

""No

replied
the

<EOS>
""Oh

<EOS>
cried
Mrs

Nettleship
,
clenching
her
hands

and
regarding
the
valet
as

she
wouldannihilate
him
.
<EOS>

falling
into
the
arms
of
the
fair
Thomasine

<EOS>
"This
is
really
too
bad
of

said
Mr.
Cripps
,
who
began
torecover
himself
a
little
.
<EOS>
"
You

deceived

<EOS>
I
thought

<EOS>
""I
received
information

replied
the
beau,"and
determined
to

you
carried
them

<EOS>
And
a

I

<EOS>
My

ordered

<EOS>
""Well

replied
Mr.

<EOS>
"
You

I

exclaimed
Mrs.

jumping
up

"
I

""The

it
is
of
no

saidMr

Cripps

saidTrussell
,
stepping
forward

"
while
he
was
duping
them

they
tried
todupe

<EOS>
I
understand
from
Mr.

who
has
it

unquestionableauthority

that
Mrs.

so
far
from

you
think
me
.
<EOS>
Good
night!""One
word
more
before
I
go
,
father
,
"
she
said
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
too
late
torevoke
your
unjust
will
.
<EOS>
""What
<EOS>
I
have
done
,
I
have
done
,
"
he
replied
.
<EOS>
And
turning
away
,
he
fixedhis
eyes
on
the
fire
.
<EOS>
Oppressed
with
the
gloomiest
foreboding
,
she
quitted
the
room
.
<EOS>
Ongaining
the
lower
room
,
she
fell
upon
her
aunt
's
bosom
in
an
agony
ofdistress
.
<EOS>
When
she
was
sufficiently
recovered
to
be
able
to
explain
toMrs
.
<EOS>
Clinton
what
had
occurred
,
the
good
old
lady
was
almost
as
muchafflicted
as
herself
.
<EOS>
"But
that
the
hour
is
so
untimely
<EOS>
,
"
she
cried
"
I
would
advise
you
to
goto
Mr.
Beechcroft
,
and
consult
him
.
<EOS>
It
would
distract
me
if
thesevillains
should
succeed
in
their
infamous
scheme
.
<EOS>
""Providence
,
to
whose
care
I
resign
myself
,
will
thwart
them
,
I
am
wellassured
!
"
rejoined
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
I
will
go
to
Mr.
Beechcroft
the
first
thingtomorrow
morning
,
and
I
am
certain
he
will
assist
me
if
he
can
.
<EOS>
And
nowlet
us
retire
to
rest
,
for
Jacob
,
it
is
clear
,
will
not
return
.
<EOS>
"Left
to
himself
,
the
miser
remained
for
some
time
cowering
over
thefire
,
and
drew
closer
to
it
as
it
burnt
lower
,
and
diffused
less
warmth
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
as
it
threatened
to
go
out
entirely
,
he
scraped
up
all
thecinders
he
could
collect
from
the
hearth
,
and
throwing
them
upon
it
,
kept
it
slightly
alive
.
<EOS>
Suddenly
,
as
if
something
had
crossed
him
,
he
arose
,
and
going
to
thetable
on
which
the
writing
materials
were
left
,
took
up
a
pen
;
but
aftergazing
some
time
vacantly
at
the
paper
he
laid
it
down
again
,
muttering"Another
time
!
<EOS>
another
time!"He
then
took
off
part
of
his
clothes
,
and
got
into
bed
.
<EOS>
But
sleep
fledhis
eyelids
;
and
dismal
thoughts
,
which
he
vainly
sought
to
shake
off
,
took
possession
of
him
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
sunk
into
a
sort
of
trance
,
duringwhich
a
hideous
night
-
mare
,
in
the
shape
of
a
mountain
of
gold
,
laid
itsheavy
hand
upon
him
.
<EOS>
Half
stifled
,
he
started
bolt
upright
in
bed
,
andgazed
timorously
round
the
imperfectly
-
lighted
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
gustynight
,
and
the
noise
of
the
casements
creaking
in
the
wind
,
added
to
hisfears
.
<EOS>
Unable
to
endure
this
state
of
nervous
apprehension
longer
,
he
sprangout
of
bed
,
and
hastily
wrapping
himself
in
his
dressing
-
gown
,
took
downthe
pistol
from
the
hook
over
the
chimney
,
and
proceeded
to
the
closetwhere
he
fancied
he
heard
some
one
trying
to
break
in
,
and
examined
thewindow
,
but
it
appeared
perfectly
secure
.
<EOS>
No
sooner
,
however
,
was
one
source
of
dread
removed
than
another
wasaroused
.
<EOS>
His
hoards
might
be
gone
!
<EOS>
Terrified
by
this
idea
,
he
flew
toall
his
hiding
places
,
and
placed
their
contents
on
the
table
.
<EOS>
His
dimeyes
sparkled
with
unnatural
brilliancy
as
he
gloated
over
them
.
<EOS>
While
telling
over
the
pieces
and
weighing
them
in
his
hand
,
a
newrecollection
crossed
him
.
<EOS>
Snatching
up
the
candle
,
he
hurried
to
a
smallcupboard
at
one
side
of
the
room
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
lay
a
heap
ofold
rags
and
rubbish
,
apparently
put
there
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
Hastilyremoving
this
dusty
pile
,
some
halfdozen
leathern
bags
were
exposed
toview
.
<EOS>
"Here
<EOS>
they
are!--here
they
are
!
"
<EOS>
he
exclaimed
,
with
a
cry
of
childishdelight
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
darlings!--my
treasures!--how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Yougive
me
new
life
.
<EOS>
Talk
of
physic
--
pshaw
!
<EOS>
there
is
none
like
gold
.
<EOS>
Thesight
of
it
cures
me
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
I
feel
well
--
quite
well
;
no
,
notquite
,
"
he
added
,
as
a
sudden
giddiness
seized
him
,
and
he
had
to
catchat
the
closet
door
for
support
;
"
<EOS>
not
quite
well
,
but
better
--
muchbetter
.
<EOS>
What
a
memory
mine
must
be
to
forget
these
bags
--
each
containingtwo
hundred
guineas
--
<EOS>
that
's
twelve
hundred
!
<EOS>
Twelve
hundred
guineas
!
<EOS>
andI
had
forgotten
them
.
<EOS>
I
hope
I
have
not
forgotten
anything
else
.
<EOS>
Let
mesee
--
<EOS>
Oh
,
my
head!--my
head
!
"
<EOS>
he
continued
,
shaking
it
mournfully
.
"
<EOS>
Mymemory
's
clean
gone!--clean
gone
!
<EOS>
But
what
shall
I
do
with
these
bags?they're
not
safe
here
.
<EOS>
Jacob
may
find
them
in
cleaning
the
room
.
<EOS>
I'llhide
them
in
the
cellar
with
the
other
treasure
.
<EOS>
"Utterly
<EOS>
forgetful
that
the
chest
had
been
removed
,
he
immediately
setabout
executing
his
design
.
<EOS>
Listening
at
the
door
to
hear
that
all
wasstill
,
he
took
up
two
of
the
bags
,
with
the
intention
of
carrying
themdown
stairs
;
but
finding
them
too
heavy
for
him
,
he
was
obliged
tocontent
himself
with
one
,
and
thus
,
in
transporting
them
all
to
thecellar
,
he
had
to
perform
six
journeys
.
<EOS>
The
last
had
nearly
proved
fatal
,
for
,
as
he
tottered
down
the
cellarsteps
,
he
missed
his
footing
,
and
rolled
to
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
With
somedifficulty
he
got
up
again
;
but
heedless
of
the
bruises
he
had
received
,
he
picked
up
his
candle
,
which
was
extinguished
in
the
fall
,
<EOS>
andreturned
to
his
bed
-
chamber
to
light
it
at
the
fire
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
heprocured
the
shovel
,
and
repairing
to
the
cellar
,
commenced
his
task
.
<EOS>
In
his
present
state
of
debility
and
exhaustion
,
it
cost
him
infinitelabour
to
get
up
the
bricks
,
and
he
was
frequently
obliged
to
desistfrom
the
toil
,
and
rest
himself
;
but
though
he
shook
in
everylimb
--
though
thick
damps
burst
from
every
pore
,
he
still
persevered
.
<EOS>
Having
got
out
the
bricks
,
he
carefully
scraped
off
the
surface
of
theloose
sandy
soil
.
<EOS>
Surprised
that
the
spade
met
with
no
resistance
,
hisalarm
was
instantly
excited
,
and
he
plunged
it
deeply
into
the
ground
.
<EOS>
But
no
chest
was
there!For
a
few
minutes
he
stood
transfixed
with
despair
.
<EOS>
It
never
occurred
tohim
that
he
had
himself
removed
his
treasure
,
but
he
concluded
he
hadbeen
robbed
of
it
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
his
anguish
found
vent
in
a
piercing
cry
,
and
he
rushed
towards
the
door
,
with
the
intention
of
calling
up
Jacob
,
but
the
recollection
that
forced
itself
upon
him
that
the
porter
wasfrom
home
checked
him
.
<EOS>
Other
imperfect
ideas
thronged
upon
his
bewildered
brain
.
<EOS>
A
glimmeringrecollection
of
digging
up
the
chest
crossed
him
,
but
he
fancied
he
musthave
taken
out
its
contents
and
buried
them
deeper
in
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Somewhat
calmed
by
this
idea
,
he
commenced
digging
anew
with
frightfulardour
,
and
soon
cleared
out
the
soil
to
nearly
the
depth
of
three
feet
.
<EOS>
But
as
he
found
nothing
,
his
apprehensions
returned
with
new
force
,
andparalysed
his
efforts
.
<EOS>
Throwing
aside
the
spade
,
he
groped
about
in
thesandy
soil
with
his
hands
,
in
the
hope
of
finding
a
few
pieces
of
gold
.
<EOS>
A
single
piece
would
have
satisfied
<EOS>
him,--but
there
was
none
--
nothingbut
little
pebbles
mixed
with
the
sand
.
<EOS>
His
moans
,
while
thus
employed
,
were
truly
piteous
.
<EOS>
At
this
juncture
,
his
candle
,
which
had
long
been
expiring
in
thesocket
,
went
out
,
leaving
him
in
total
darkness
.
<EOS>
A
mortal
faintnessseized
him
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
get
out
of
the
hole
,
but
fellback
with
the
effort,--his
head
striking
against
the
bricks
.
<EOS>
Hestruggled
to
get
up
again
,
but
in
vain
--
his
limbs
refused
their
office
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
cry
out
for
help
,
but
a
hollow
,
rattling
sound
alone
issuedfrom
his
throat
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
by
a
conclusive
effort
,
he
did
continue
to
lift
his
head
fromthe
ground
;
but
that
was
all
he
could
do
.
<EOS>
His
hands
clutchedineffectually
at
the
sandy
soil
;
his
frame
was
powerless
;
and
a
stifledgroan
broke
from
his
lips
.
<EOS>
But
this
condition
was
too
horrible
for
long
endurance
.
<EOS>
The
muscles
ofhis
neck
relaxed
;
his
head
fell
heavily
backwards
;
and
after
a
gasp
ortwo
,
respiration
ceased
.
<EOS>
Thus
died
this
unhappy
man
,
unattended
,
in
a
cellar
,
half
entombed
inthe
hole
digged
as
a
hiding
place
for
a
portion
of
his
wealth
--
wealth
,
for
which
he
had
sacrificed
all
his
comforts
,
all
his
feelings
,
all
hisaffections
,
and
for
which
alone
of
late
he
had
seemed
to
live
!
<EOS>
Thus
heperished
--
a
fearful
example
of
the
effects
of
the
heart
-
searing
vice
,
ofwhich
<EOS>
he
was
the
slave
and
the
victim!CHAPTER

JACOB
'S
GRIEF
FOR
HIS
MASTER.Unconscious
of
the
awful
catastrophe
that
had
occurred
<EOS>
,
Hilda
,
whoseeyes
had
never
closed
since
she
sought
her
pillow
,
arose
at
an
earlyhour
,
and
set
out
for
Abel
Beechcroft
's
residence
.
<EOS>
Abel
had
not
yet
left
his
room
,
but
she
found
Mr.
Jukes
astir
,
and
insome
alarm
at
the
absence
of
Trussell
and
Randulph
;
but
she
allayed
hisfears
by
telling
him
what
she
supposed
had
happened
.
<EOS>
She
was
then
shewninto
the
library
,
and
shortly
afterwards
Abel
Beechcroft
made
hisappearance
.
<EOS>
He
was
prepared
for
some
disastrous
tidings
,
and
the
momenthe
saw
her
,
her
looks
confirmed
his
fears
.
<EOS>
After
a
kindly
greeting
,
sheproceeded
to
recount
to
him
the
infamous
scheme
practised
upon
herfather
by
Philip
and
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"This
is
worse
than
even
I
anticipated
,
"
said
Abel
,
as
she
closed
herrecital
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Your
father
is
infatuated
on
the
subject
of
his
nephew
,
whoseconduct
,
as
well
as
that
of
his
attorney
,
is
scandalous
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
withyou
at
once
.
<EOS>
If
not
too
late
,
and
he
is
in
his
right
mind
<EOS>
,
I
think
I
canuse
such
arguments
with
your
father
as
will
induce
him
to
alter
hisiniquitous
design
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
so
,
"
sighed
Hilda
,
"
<EOS>
but
I
have
great
misgivings
.
<EOS>
"As
they
were
quitting
the
room
,
they
were
stopped
by
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
up
at
this
hour
,
sister
?
"
cried
Abel
,
somewhat
discomposed
.
<EOS>
"I
was
informed
that
Miss
Scarve
was
here
,
"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
;
"
and
Itherefore
hurried
down
as
fast
as
I
could
.
<EOS>
As
an
old
friend
of
hermother
,
I
naturally
felt
anxious
to
see
her
.
"
<EOS>
And
she
embraced
Hildaaffectionately
.
<EOS>
"I
am
sorry
to
abridge
your
first
meeting
with
the
daughter
of
an
oldfriend
,
Sophia
,
"
interposed
Abel
,
"
but
when
you
are
told
that
herfather

who
,
you
know
is
in
a
very
precarious
condition

has
beenprevailed
upon
to
make
a

in
his
nephew

<EOS>
,
you
will
see
thatnot
<EOS>
a

must
be
lost
in
trying
to
induce

to
revoke
it

<EOS>
""I

"
replied
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"
But
where
is
Randulph?""He

replied
Abel

sarcastically

"Not

Mrs.

turning
pale
.
<EOS>
"
What

Abel

hastily

"

again
embracing

.
<EOS>
"
I

<EOS>
and
she
laid
a
slight
emphasis
on
thepronoun--"interest

<EOS>
I
already

you

""And

"
repliedHilda
.
<EOS>
And
she
quitted
the
house
with
Abel
Beechcroft
,
who
displayedconsiderable
impatience
during
her
interview
with
his
sister
.
<EOS>
On
their
arrival
at
the
Little
Sanctuary
,
they
were
admitted
by
Mrs
.
Clinton
,
for
Jacob
had
not
yet
returned
.
<EOS>
After
some
littleconsideration
,
Abel
went
up
alone
to
the
miser
's
room
,
and
,
knocking
twoor
three
times
,
and
receiving
no
answer
,
opened
the
door
.
<EOS>
Approaching
the
bed
,
he
found
it
empty
,
with
the
clothes
turned
down
,
asleft
by
the
miser
,
and
casting
a
hurried
glance
into
the
closet
,
tosatisfy
himself
that
no
one
was
there
,
he
hastily
ran
down
stairs
toHilda
,
to
acquaint
her
with
the
alarming
discovery
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
She
was
greatly
terrified
,
but
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
suggestedthat
her
father
might
possibly
have
gone
down
to
the
cellar
,
and
relatedthe
circumstance
which
she
herself
had
once
witnessed
there
.
<EOS>
Concurringin
the
opinion
,
Abel
offered
immediately
to
go
in
search
of
him
,
anddissuading
Hilda
,
who
secretly
shared
his
worst
apprehensions
,
fromaccompanying
him
,
took
a
candle
,
and
descended
to
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
As
he
entered
the
vault
,
he
indistinctly
perceived
a
ghastly
object
;
andspringing
forward
,
held
up
the
light
,
so
as
to
reveal
it
more
fully
.
<EOS>
Hisfancy
had
not
deceived
him
.
<EOS>
There
in
a
grave,--evidently
digged
by
hisown
hands,--lay
<EOS>
his
old
enemy
--
dead
<EOS>
--
dead!While
Abel
was
wrapt
in
contemplation
of
this
miserable
spectacle
,
andsurrendering
himself
to
the
thoughts
which
it
inspired
,
heavy
steps
wereheard
behind
him
,
and
Jacob
rushed
into
the
cellar
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
he
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
porter
,
in
accents
of
alarm
.
"
<EOS>
Has
anythinghappened
?
<EOS>
Ha

I
see
.
"
<EOS>
And
pushing
past
Abel
Beechcroft
,
he
precipitatedhimself
into
the
hole
with
his
master
.
<EOS>
"All
's
over
with
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
a
voice
of
agony
and
self
-
reproach
,
and
grasping
the
cold
hand
of
the
corpse--"this
would
never
havehappened
if
I
had
been
at
home
.
<EOS>
I
'm
in
a
manner
his
murderer!""Another
hand
than
yours
has
been
at
work
here
,
Jacob
,
"
said
Abel
;
"
andterrible
as
your
poor
master
's
fate
has
been
,
it
may
prove
a
salutarylesson
to
others
.
<EOS>
There
he
lies
,
who
a
few
hours
ago
was
the
possessorof
useless
thousands
,
the
value
of
which
he
knew
not
--
nay
,
the
veryexistence
of
which
he
knew
not
--
for
the
few
bags
of
gold
beside
him
werethe
only
palpable
treasure
he
owned
.
<EOS>
There
he
lies
,
who
tormentedhimself
with
a
vainer
quest
than
ever
lured
the
blind
searcher
after
thephilosopher
's
stone
!
<EOS>
There
he
lies
,
the
saddest
and
most
degrading
<EOS>
proofof
the
vanity
of
human
desires
,
having
died
the
death
of
a
dog
,
with
noheart
to
grieve
for
him
,
no
eye
to
weep
for
him!""You're
wrong
in
sayin
'
no
one
grieves
for
him
,
sir
<EOS>
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
,
ina
broken
voice
,
"
because
I
do
.
<EOS>
With
all
his
faults
,
I
loved
him
--
nay
,
<EOS>
Ithink
I
loved
him
the
better
for
his
faults
--
and
though
I
often
talkedof
leavin
'
him
,
I
never
really
meant
to
do
so
.
<EOS>
""Your
<EOS>
feelings
do
you
credit
,
Jacob
,
and
are
consistent
with
the
notionI
<EOS>
had
formed
of
you
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"I
could
n't
have
said
as
much
to
him
while
he
was
alive
,
"
blubberedJacob
,
"
not
if
he
would
have
given
me
half
his
treasure
to
utter
it
.
<EOS>
ButI'm
sorry
I
did
n't
hear
his
humours
better
now
.
<EOS>
""A
natural
regret
,
Jacob
,
"
said
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
compunction
we
feel
forunkindness
exhibited
by
us
to
the
dead
should
teach
us
consideration
tothe
living
.
<EOS>
I
could
forgive
your
poor
master
all
but
the
last
act
of
hislife
.
<EOS>
""What
was
that
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Jacob
looking
up
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
leaving
his
property
away
from
his
daughter
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
PhilipFrewin
visited
him
late
last
night
with
Diggs
,
and
induced
him
to
make
awill
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
""Hell
's
curses
on
them
both
!
"
<EOS>
roared
Jacob
,
in
a
furious
tone
,
springingout
of
the
excavation
.
"
<EOS>
And
Philip
came
here
!
<EOS>
That
was
the
reason
,
then
,
why
we
were
locked
up
in
the
watch'us
.
<EOS>
I
thought
there
was
somethin'
init
.
<EOS>
They
did
well
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
.
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
at
home
,
I'dhave
killed
'em
outright
,
if
I
had
been
hanged
for
it
,
sooner
than
thisshould
have
happened
.
<EOS>
And
do
you
mean
to
say
,
sir
,
that
he
hasdisinherited
Miss
Hilda
entirely?""Unless
<EOS>
she
marries
Philip
Frewin
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"You've
dried
my
eves
with
a
vengeance
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
could
almostfind
in
my
heart
to
spurn
his
avaricious
old
carcase
.
<EOS>
But
it
's
notaltogether
his
fault
.
<EOS>
The
crime
lies
chiefly
at
the
door
of
thatscoundrel
Diggs
.
<EOS>
But
such
a
will
wo
nt
hold
good
,
<EOS>
sir
,
will
it?""I
hope
not
,
"
sighed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
But
I
must
go
up
stairs
to
our
youngmistress
,
to
acquaint
her
with
her
bereavement
.
<EOS>
It
will
be
your
care
toremove
the
body

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with

he
quitted

<EOS>
HILDA.Abel
's
looks
,
as
he
approached
Hilda
,
convinced
her
of
what
hadhappened
,
and
rendered
the
announcement
of
the
melancholy
tidings
he
hadto
communicate
almost
superfluous
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
have
lost
a
father
,
my
dear
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
in
a
tone
of
thedeepest
commiseration
;
"
but
you
have
a
friend
left
,
who
will
endeavourto
supply
his
place
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
could
only
thank
him
by
her
looks
.
<EOS>
"Under
<EOS>
any
circumstances
,
this
would
have
been
a
heavy
blow
to
you,"pursued
Abel
,
"
but
under
the
present
,
it
comes
with
additional
severity
.
<EOS>
Still
,
I
am
sure
you
have
fortitude
to
support
the
trial
;
and
I
trust
,
with
the
blessing
of
God
,
to
restore
you
to
your
rights
.
<EOS>
Need
<EOS>
I
say
myhouse
is
your
home
,
and
that
of
your
worthy
aunt
,
whenever
you
choose
toremove
to
it
.
<EOS>
""I
feel
your
kindness
deeply
,
very
deeply
,
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
,
"
but
aslong
as
circumstances
will
permit
me
,
I
will
stay
here
.
<EOS>
"Just
<EOS>
then
a
knock
was
heard
at
the
door
,
and
as
no
answer
was
returnedby
those
within
,
it
was
opened
,
giving
entrance
to
Philip
Frewin
andDiggs
.
<EOS>
They
both
appeared
disconcerted
on
seeing
Abel
Beechcroft
,
butDiggs
instantly
recovered
himself
,
and
looking
round
,
at
onceconjectured
what
had
happened
.
<EOS>
"Miss
Scarve
,
"
he
said
,
"
we
were
passing
by
the
house
,
and
seeing
thestreet
door
<EOS>
open,--a
very
unusual
occurrence
here
--
entered
withoutknocking
.
<EOS>
I
hope
and
trust
nothing
is
amiss
.
<EOS>
""Go
into
the
cellar
,
and
satisfy
yourself
,
"
said
Abel
Beechcroft
,
sternly
.
<EOS>
"Good
<EOS>
God
,
sir
,
you
do
n't
mean
to
insinuate
that
Mr.
Scarve
has
died
inthe
cellar
!
"
cried
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"Oons
!
<EOS>
I
hope
not
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Philip
,
scarcely
able
to
conceal
hissatisfaction
.
<EOS>
"
How
is
my
uncle
,
Hilda?""My
father
is
dead
,
"
she
replied
,
in
a
freezing
tone
.
<EOS>
"Dead
!
"
repeated
Philip
,
"
Lord
bless
me
!
<EOS>
how
very
sudden
.
<EOS>
Lucky
wehappened
to
turn
in
,
Diggs
.
<EOS>
Can
we
do
anything
for
you
,
cousin?"Hilda
made
no
reply
,
but
the
attorney
immediately
interposed
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
your
uncle
's
executor
,
and
in
a
manner
his
heir
,
Mr.
Frewin
,
"
hesaid
,
"
it
is
your
duty
to
seal
up
all
his
chests
,
cupboards
,
bureaux
,
and
drawers
,
without
delay
.
<EOS>
I
will
assist
you
.
<EOS>
""Hold
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Abel
,
"
I
give
you
both
notice
that
Miss
Scarveconsiders
that
the
will
under
which
you
propose
to
act
,
has
beenfraudulently
obtained
;
and
she
will
dispute
it
.
<EOS>
""Miss
<EOS>
Scarve
will
act
as
her
feelings
dictate
,
or
she
may
be
advised
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
;
"
but
,
in
the
meantime
,
it
will
be
right
forMr
.
<EOS>
Frewin
to
take
proper
precautions
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
to
Mr.
Scarve'schamber
,
sir
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
and
disregarding
the
looks
of
disgust
directed
against
themby
Abel
,
they
went
up
stairs
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
do
not
leave
me
till
they
are
gone
,
Mr
Beechcroft
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
will
not
,
"
he
replied
,
taking
a
seat
beside
her
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
attorney
and
his
companion
proceeded
about
their
taskwith
some
semblance
of
feeling
,
but
real
indifference
.
<EOS>
Having
glancedthrough
the
room
up
stairs
,
and
swept
all
the
poor
miser
's
hoards
,
whichwere
strewn
about
the
table
,
into
a
chest
,
which
he
locked
,
Diggs
calledPhilip
's
attention
to
the
position
of
the
pen
and
paper
,
saying
,
"
I
amalmost
certain
he
meant
to
write
something
--
perhaps
revoke
his
will
<EOS>
--
butit
was
too
late
--
ha
!
<EOS>
ha!"With
<EOS>
a
sly
chuckle
<EOS>
,
he
then
proceeded
to
seal
up
all
the
boxes
andcases
.
<EOS>
In
this
task
he
was
assisted
by
Philip
Frewin
,
and
they
had
justconcluded
it
,
when
heavy
footsteps
were
heard
on
the
stairs
,
and
thenext
moment
the
door
was
thrown
open
,
and
Jacob
entered
the
room
,
carrying
in
his
arms
the
body
of
his
master
,
which
he
deposited
on
thebed
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
this
is
how
he
died
?
<EOS>
said
Philip
,
casting
a
shuddering
glance
atthe
corpse
.
<EOS>
"Ay
,
ay
,
you
calculated
your
chances
nicely
,
"
rejoined
Jacob
.
"
<EOS>
You'dcheat
<EOS>
the
devil
,
you
would
.
<EOS>
But
you
have
n't
got
the
fortune
yet
.
<EOS>
""Harkee
,
friend
Jacob
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
I
will
thank
you
to
speak
morerespectfully
to
me
in
future
,
or
I
will
let
you
know
who
is
masterhere
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
shall
never
be
my
master
,
"
replied
Jacob
;
"
and
if
I
only
get
theword
from
my
young
missis
,
see
if
I
do
n't
turn
you
both
out
of
thehouse
,
neck
and
heels
.
<EOS>
"Philip
would
have
made
an
angry
retort
,
but
Diggs
checked
him
,
whispering
that
"
it
would
not
do
just
now
.
<EOS>
""You
may
get
off
from
me
,
"
pursued
Jacob
;
"
but
you
wo
nt
get
off
from
Mr
.
<EOS>
Randulph
Crew
for
your
conduct
towards
him
last
night
.
<EOS>
""I
am
ready
to
render
Mr.
Crew
an
account
of
my
conduct
whenever
he
mayrequire
it
,
"
replied
Philip
,
haughtily
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
will
follow
my
advice
,
sir
,
now
that
your
prospects
are
fullysettled
,
you
will
leave
off
these
brawls
,
altogether
,
"
observed
Diggs
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
Mr.
Randulph
Crew
threatens
you
with
an
assault
,
give
him
in
chargeof
a
constable
,
and
leave
the
rest
to
me
.
<EOS>
""I
believe
that
will
be
the
best
plan
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
"Much
the
best
for
a
coward
to
pursue
--
faugh
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Jacob
,
with
alook
of
supreme
contempt
.
<EOS>
Diggs
and
his
companion
then
went
down
stairs
to
the
cellar
,
where
thebags
of
gold
were
still
left
,
and
having
examined
them
,
locked
the
door
,
and
put
seals
upon
it
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
they
repaired
to
the
parlour
,
and
Diggs
stepping
up
to
Hilda
,
addressed
her:"Chancing
to
have
your
father
's
last
will
in
my
pocket
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
hesaid
,
"
I
will
read
it
to
you,--as
the
sooner
you
are
made
acquaintedwith
his
injunctions
the
better
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Beechcroft
,
I
also
request
yourattention
to
the
document
;
and
you
too
,
Mrs.
Clinton
,
that
you
may
notafterwards
plead
ignorance
of
it
.
"And
<EOS>
without
further
preliminary
,
he
read
the
will
.
<EOS>
"It
is
sufficiently
intelligible
,
I
must
say
,
"
observed
Abel
,
as
heconcluded
;
"
<EOS>
and
I
must
also
say
,
that
I
never
listened
to
a
moredisgraceful
document
.
<EOS>
""You
are
at
liberty
to
make
any
comment
upon
it
you
think
fit
,
sir,"said
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
prepared
for
expressions
ofdisappointment
on
your
part
.
""Why
on
my
part
,
sir
?
"
rejoined
Abel
.
"Because
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
's
wise
disposition
of
his
property
has
prevented
youfrom
securing
it
for
your
nephew
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
A
deep
flush
dyed
Abel
's
pale
cheek
,
and
he
fixed
his
kindling
eye
uponthe
attorney
.
<EOS>
"Up
<EOS>
to
this
point
you
have
succeeded
in
your
villainy
,
Mr.
Diggs
,
"
hesaid
,
"
but
you
may
depend
upon
it
,
your
triumph
will
be
brief
.
<EOS>
Thatinstrument
will
never
hold
good
,
and
the
manner
in
which
you
haveobtained
it
,
with
other
of
your
recent
acts
,
will
drive
you
from
theprofession
,
if
they
do
not
also
banish
you
from
the
country
.
<EOS>
""I
laugh
at
your
threats
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
"
My
position
istoo
firm
to
be
shaken
by
anything
you
can
say
or
do
.
<EOS>
And
you
will
findthis
will
equally
firm
.
<EOS>
Its
motive
is
too
apparent
to
admit
of
dispute
.
<EOS>
My
late
respected
and
lamented
client
wished
to
marry
his
daughter
tohis
nephew
,
and
fearing
that
she
would
disobey
his
injunctions
<EOS>
,
tookcare
that
she
should
not
do
so
without
forfeiting
his
property
.
<EOS>
Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
this
.
<EOS>
If
Miss
Scarve
thinks
otherwise
,
she
can
dispute
the
will
.
<EOS>
But
she
will
find
it
as
difficult
to
be
setaside
,
as
her
father
,
while
living
,
was
to
be
turned
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
act
strictly
up
to
the
conditions
of
my
uncles
will
,
"
saidPhilip
Frewin
;
"
and
it
will
be
matter
of
deep
regret
to
me
if
my
faircousin
should
refuse
to
accede
to
them
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
urge
her
at
thismoment
,
but
will
call
again
in
the
course
of
the
day
for
her
answer
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
with
a
supercilious
bow
,
he
took
his
departure
with
the
attorney
.
<EOS>
For
some
time
after
they
were
gone
,
not
a
wold
was
uttered
by
the
groupleft
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
Abel
was
buried
in
deep
thought
,
and
neither
of
theothers
appeared
inclined
to
break
the
silence
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
Abel
arousedhimself
,
and
,
turning
to
Mrs.
Clinton
,
requested
to
be
left
alone
a
fewminutes
with
Hilda
;
the
good
lady
immediately
withdrew
.
<EOS>
"It
may
be
,
Hilda
,
"
he
said
,
in
a
voice
of
much
emotion,--"though
<EOS>
Godforbid
it
should
be
so,--that
<EOS>
the
issue
of
this
contest
will
be
againstus
,
and
the
will
be
declared
valid
.
<EOS>
I
can
not
free
myself
from
somemisgivings
.
<EOS>
""Nor
<EOS>
I
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
;
"
and
yet
,
<EOS>
to
shew
you
<EOS>
how
strangely
andinconsistently
my
father
has
acted
,
you
will
see
from
this,"--and
shedrew
forth
a
slip
of
paper
from
her
<EOS>
bosom--"that
he
was
under
anobligation
to
the
late
Mr.
Crew
to
give
me
to
his
son
Randulph
,
with
acertain
dowry
.
<EOS>
"Abel
glanced
over
the
document
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"Would
<EOS>
I
had
seen
this
in
his
lifetime
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
.
<EOS>
"But
for
his
violence
you
would
have
seen
it
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
I
wasabout
to
shew
it
you
when
you
last
saw
him
,
and
was
only
deterred
by
thestate
of
excitement
into
which
he
was
thrown
.
<EOS>
""How
unfortunate
!
"
exclaimed
Abel
.
"
<EOS>
But
perhaps
the
document
may
stillbe
of
use
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
he
arose
and
paced
the
room
to
and
fro
,
in
extreme
agitation
.
<EOS>
Atlast
he
stopped
before
Hilda
,
regarding
her
fixedly
.
<EOS>
"Answer
<EOS>
me
sincerely
<EOS>
,
"
he
said--"do
you
love
Randulph?""You
need
scarcely
ask
that
question
,
sir
,
"
she
rejoined
,
blushing
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
match
seems
ordained
by
Heaven
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Abel
;
"
it
is
useless
tooppose
it
.
<EOS>
Listen
to
me
,
Hilda
.
<EOS>
I
loved
your
mother
--
deeply
,
passionately
loved
her
.
<EOS>
By
my
own
fault
,
it
seems
--
though
I
understoodit
not
then
--
I
lost
her
,
and
she
became
the
bride
of
your
father
.
<EOS>
Fromthat
time
,
I
was
doomed
to
wretchedness
,
and
though
my
sufferings
werehidden
under
the
mask
of
indifference
,
the
vulture
of
despair
wasperpetually
gnawing
at
my
heart
.
<EOS>
During
this
dreadful
period
,
when
Ihated
all
mankind
,
and
him
most
of
all
who
I
conceived
had
robbed
me
ofwhat
I
hold
dearest
on
earth
,
you
were
born
,
and
soon
afterwards
mysister
,
Mrs.
Crew
,
gave
birth
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
It
was
whispered
among
ourfamily
that
the
two
infants
would
suit
each
other
,
and
that
their
unionwould
reconcile
old
grievances
.
<EOS>
In
the
bitterness
and
anguish
of
myheart
,
I
vowed
that
this
should
never
happen
,
if
I
could
prevent
it
,
andfor
years
I
nourished
the
resolution
,
until
it
became
rooted
in
mybreast
.
<EOS>
Your
mother
died
,
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
mysorrows
and
resentments
would
be
buried
in
her
grave
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
so
.
<EOS>
There
are
some
loves
,
as
there
are
some
hatereds
,
that
survive
the
tomb
,
and
mine
was
one
of
them
.
<EOS>
Whatever
brought
her
image
to
my
mind
,
gave
meacute
suffering
,
and
I
prohibited
all
who
knew
me
,
on
pain
of
mydispleasure
,
from
alluding
to
her
in
any
way
.
<EOS>
Thus
little
reached
me
ofyou
or
your
father
,
till
Randulph
's
arrival
in
town
a
few
months
since
.
<EOS>
To
my
surprise
,
I
found
he
had
seen
you
,
and
from
the
manner
in
which
hespoke
of
you
,
I
perceived
that
he
was
smitten
by
your
charms
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
<EOS>
uttered
a
slight
exclamation
.
<EOS>
"I
will
not
disguise
from
you
,
"
pursued
Abel
,
"
that
this
discovery
gaveme
inexpressible
uneasiness
,
and
I
sought
by
every
means
in
my
power
,
toprevent
him
from
seeing
you
again
.
<EOS>
But
fate
had
decreed
it
otherwise
.
<EOS>
Chance
brought
you
together
again
and
again
,
until
the
final
adventureat
Vauxhall
seemed
to
link
your
affections
together
indissolubly
.
<EOS>
""It
did
so
,
"
observed
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"Notwithstanding
<EOS>
all
this
,
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
consent
to
yourmarriage
,
"
continued
Abel
,
"
<EOS>
nay
,
I
determined
to
cast
off
Randulph
forever
,
if
he
disobeyed
me
.
<EOS>
My
resolution
was
somewhat
shaken
by
yourfather
's
illness
,
and
I
began
to
find
my
dislike
to
the
connexionabating
.
<EOS>
Can
you
understand
these
contradictory
feelings
,
Hilda
,
for
Iloved
you
all
the
time
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
can
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"That
<EOS>
which
alone
removed
my
objection
,
"
said
Abel
,
sternly
,
"
was
thesad
spectacle
<EOS>
I
beheld
in
the
cellar
this
morning
.
<EOS>
After
the
sight
Ithere
witnessed
,
I
could
not
retain
further
animosity
against
the
authorof
my
misery
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
review
the
past
with
calmness
.
<EOS>
I
can
now
thinkof
your
mother
without
pain
,
and
of
your
father
without
heart
-
burning
.
<EOS>
Ican
love
you
as
their
child
,
without
other
feelings
obtruding
upon
me
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
opening
his
arms
,
he
folded
Hilda
in
a
strict
embrace
.
<EOS>
"Bless
<EOS>
you
!
<EOS>
bless
you
,
my
child
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
"
If
Randulph
proves
worthy
ofyou
,
he
shall
have
you
.
"Hilda
<EOS>
averted
her
head
,
and
there
was
silence
between
them
for
a
briefspace
.
<EOS>
"You
wished
to
have
some
communication
with
my
poor
father
before
hisdeath
,
"
she
said
,
at
length
.
<EOS>
"
I
hope
it
was
not
of
importance
.
<EOS>
""Only
to
himself
,
"
replied
Abel
,
with
a
deep
sigh
.
<EOS>
"
I
wished
to
forgivehim
for
prevailing
upon
me
,
under
the
garb
of
friendship
,
to
introducehim
to
your
mother
and
her
family
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
forgive
him
for
the
artshe
used
to
wean
her
affections
from
me
;
for
his
misrepresentations
of
mycircumstances
and
character
;
and
for
the
prolonged
anguish
he
occasionedme
,
and
to
which
death
would
have
been
preferable
.
<EOS>
I
wished
to
say
thusmuch
to
him
--
to
hear
from
his
own
lips
an
avowal
of
his
regret,--and
tobe
at
peace
with
him
for
ever!""You
are
at
peace
with
him
now
,
sir
,
I
trust
,
"
said
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"As
far
as
I
myself
am
concerned
,
I
am
so
,
"
replied
Abel
,
"
but
foryou--""Oh
,
do
not
think
of
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
him
from
the
bottom
ofmy
heart
.
<EOS>
He
has
been
the
dupe
of
others
.
<EOS>
""Say
,
rather
,
he
has
been
the
bond
-
slave
of
Mammon
,
"
replied
Abel
,
sternly
,
"
who
has
destroyed
him

as
he
destroys
all
his
worshippers

ButI
will
not
pain
you

Be
assured
nothing

you
againin

in

he
took

CHAPTER
XIV.--PHILIP
FREWIN
IS
DANGEROUSLY
WOUNDED
BY
RANDULPH
--
<EOS>
HIS
LAST
<EOS>
VINDICTIVEEFFORT.Randulph
's
feelings
on
awaking
,
and
finding
himself
in
the
watch
-
house
,
were
at
first
humiliating
and
full
of
self
-
reproach
.
<EOS>
But
by
degreesthese
milder
sentiments
speedily
gave
way
to
anger
against
PhilipFrewin
;
and
so
indignant
<EOS>
did
he
become
,
on
reflection
,
at
the
conduct
ofthe
latter
,
that
he
resolved
that
his
first
business
on
obtaining
hisfreedom
,
should
be
to
seek
him
out
,
and
call
him
to
a
strict
account
.
<EOS>
His
wrath
had
by
no
means
abated
,
as
Mr.
Foggo
entered
the
chamber
,
alittle
before
eight
o'clock
to
call
up
him
and
his
companions
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
hope
you
rested
well
,
gen'l'men
,
"
said
the
constable
,
with
a
somewhatmalicious
grin
.
<EOS>
"
Will
you
please
to
have
breakfast?""Not
here
,
Mr.
Foggo
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
yawning
.
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
said
,
last
night,--or
else
I
dreamed
it,--that
it
would
n't
be
necessary
to
gobefore
a
magistrate
.
<EOS>
""I
think
it
may
be
managed
,
sir
,
"
said
the
constable
,
"
provided
--
<EOS>
ahem!""Provided
we
come
down,--eh
,
Mr.
Foggo
?
"
rejoined
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"Exactly
<EOS>
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
not
bribe
him
,
uncle
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Randulph
,
indignantly
.
<EOS>
"
We
have
beenmost
unjustifiably
detained
,
and
I
wish
to
be
taken
before
a
magistrate
,
that
I
may
have
an
opportunity
of
complaining
of
the
shameful
treatmentwe
have
experienced
,
as
well
as
of
preferring
a
charge
against
PhilipFrewin
.
<EOS>
""Be
advised
by
me
,
my
dear
boy
,
and
make
no
further
disturbance
aboutthe
matter
,
"
replied
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
You
'll
get
no
redress
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
,
uncle--""Between
ourselves
,
"
interrupted
Trussell
<EOS>
,
"
I
would
rather
the
affairdidn't
come
to
the
ears
of
my
brother
Abel
,
which
if
we
're
publiclyexamined
,
will
unquestionably
be
the
case
.
<EOS>
""That
's
why
I
recommend
you
not
to
go
before
his
worship
,
"
observed
thecunning
constable
;
"
it
may
be
disagreeable
in
its
consequences
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
be
sure
it
may
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
slipping
a
guinea
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"Let
<EOS>
us
out
as
fast
as
you
can
.
<EOS>
""I
shall
not
move
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Oh
!
<EOS>
it
's
quite
optional
,
"
said
Mr.
Foggo
,
evidently
disconcerted
.
<EOS>
"I
shall
go
,
at
all
events
,
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
so
shall
I
,
"
said
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
shall
get
back
to
my
poor
master
asfast
as
I
can
.
<EOS>
Lord
knows
what
may
have
happened
in
my
absence!""Well
,
if
you
're
both
going
,
I
must
perforce
accompany
you
,
"
saidRandulph
;
"
but
I
protest
against
the
step
.
<EOS>
"Mr
.
<EOS>
Foggo
attended
them
to
the
door
of
the
watchhouse
,
and
made
them
amost
polite
bow
as
he
let
them
out
.
<EOS>
Taking
a
hasty
leave
of
the
others
,
Jacob
set
off
to
the
Little
Sanctuary
,
where
,
it
is
needless
to
say
,
apainful
surprise
awaited
him
.
<EOS>
As
they
walked
along
,
Trussell
proposed
that
they
should
breakfast
at
acoffee
-
house
,
and
put
their
toilette
a
little
in
order
before
goinghome
;
and
Randulph
,
recollecting
that
Jacob
had
mentioned
the
Crown
Inn
,
in
Ox
Yard
,
as
a
place
frequented
by
Philip
Frewin
,
suggested
that
theyshould
go
there
,
Trussell
being
perfectly
agreeable
to
the
arrangement
,
they
bent
their
steps
in
that
direction
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
at
the
Crown
,
and
inquiring
for
Philip
,
they
learnt
that
hehad
rooms
in
the
house
,
but
had
been
out
the
greater
part
of
the
night
,
and
was
absent
at
the
time
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
momentarily
expected
,
andthe
waiter
promised
to
let
them
know
when
he
returned
.
<EOS>
Trussell
then
ordered
a
good
breakfast
,
to
which
,
after
making
theirtoilettes
,
they
both
did
ample
justice
.
<EOS>
At
the
expiration
of
an
hour
,
Randulph
renewed
his
inquiries
about
Philip
.
<EOS>
Still
,
he
had
not
returned
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
if
you
like
to
wait
here
for
him
,
"
said
Trussell
,
"
I
will
gohome
,
and
make
some
excuse
for
you
,
and
will
return
and
tell
you
what
Ihave
done
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
desire
of
avenging
himself
on
Philip
Frewin
being
now
paramount
inRandulph
's
breast
,
he
readily
assented
to
this
plan
,
and
Trusselldeparted
.
<EOS>
Having
fee'd
the
waiter
to
ensure
the
accomplishment
of
hisobject
,
Randulph
flung
himself
into
a
seat
,
and
was
musing
over
theevents
of
the
previous
night
,
by
way
of
keeping
up
his
choler
againstPhilip
,
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
,
and
a
man
stepping
into
thechamber
,
was
about
to
withdraw
,
with
an
apology
for
his
intrusion
,
whena
cry
from
Randulph
,
who
recognised
him
as
Cordwell
Firebras
,
checkedhim
.
<EOS>
"What
!
<EOS>
is
it
you
,
Randulph
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Firebras
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"
Icame
here
to
meet
another
person
,
but
you
are
the
man
of
all
others
Imost
wished
to
see
.
<EOS>
What
the
deuce
are
you
doing
here?""I
am
waiting
to
see
Philip
Frewin
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
"
<EOS>
He
served
me
ascurvy
trick
last
night
,
and
got
me
shut
up
in
the
watch
-
house
,
and
Imean
to
chastise
him
.
<EOS>
""I
sha'n't
hinder
your
laudable
design
,
"
replied
Firebras
,
laughing
.
<EOS>
"But
,
"
he
added
,
closing
the
door
,
"
I
was
about
to
send
to
you
on
amatter
of
the
utmost
importance
.
<EOS>
I
have
a
proposal
to
make
to
you
thataffects
your
nearest
and
dearest
interests
.
<EOS>
Come
to
me
at
the
ChequersInn
,
Millbank
,
a
little
before
midnight
,
and
I
will
give
you
proof
thatI
hold
your
fortune
in
my
hands
.
<EOS>
""To
be
obtained
on
the
same
terms
as
heretofore
?
<EOS>
"
demanded
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Hear
<EOS>
what
I
have
got
to
propose
,
and
then
inquire
the
conditions,"rejoined
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
I
will
come
,
"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
As
he
said
this
,
the
waiter
entered
the
room
,
and
made
a
sign
to
himthat
his
man
had
arrived
.
<EOS>
Randulph
's
eyes
sparkled
,
and
without
saying
a
word
,
he
beckonedFirebras
to
follow
him
,
and
,
directed
by
the
waiter
,
proceeded
toPhilip
's
room
,
which
immediately
adjoined
his
own
.
<EOS>
Philip
was
not
alone
.
<EOS>
He
was
attended
by
Captain
Culpepper
,
and
waslaughingly
counting
out
a
sum
of
money
for
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
glee
died
awayon
beholding
Randulph
's
stern
looks
,
and
he
would
have
beaten
a
retreat
,
if
Firebras
had
not
closed
the
door
,
and
planted
his
bulky
person
beforeit
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
you
want
here
,
sir
?
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
in
as
fierce
a
tone
as
he
couldcommand
,
to
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
This
is
my
room

you
have
no

cried
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"If
I
treat
you
as
a
gentleman

scoundrel
,
it
is
more
than
you
deserve,"said
<EOS>
Randulph
,
fiercely
;
"

I
demand
instant
satisfaction

night

<EOS>
""I

""This
is
a

coward

"

cried
Randulph
;
"

it

notavail
you

And
he
struck
him
with
the
flat
of
his
sword

"

'S

<EOS>
sir

hold

cried
Captain

whipping

interposing

"

Leave

""No

said
Cordwell
Firebras
,
stepping
forward
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Letthem
settle
the
matter
themselves
.
<EOS>
If
Mr.
Frewin
is
a
gentleman
,
he
willgive
Mr.
Crew
satisfaction
;
and
if
he
is
not
,
you
must
agree
with
me
,
asa
man
of
honour
,
that
no
punishment
can
be
too
degrading
for
him
.
<EOS>
""I
must
confess
there
is
reason
in
what
you
say
,
sir

"
repliedCulpepper
.
"
<EOS>
Fight
him
,
sir
--
fight
him
!
"
<EOS>
he
whispered
to
Philip--"I'llhelp
you
,
if
you
require
it
.
<EOS>
""Hold
<EOS>
your
hand
,
ruffian
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Philip
,
exasperated
by
the
treatment
hehad
experienced
,
"
and
look
to
yourself
.
"And
<EOS>
drawing
his
sword
,
he
attacked
Randulph
with
the
utmost
fury
.
<EOS>
It
wasevident
,
from
his
style
of
fencing
,
that
Philip
did
not
want
skill
;
buthis
passion
robbed
him
of
judgment
,
and
he
frequently
exposed
himself
tohis
antagonist
,
who
fought
with
great
coolness
,
evidently
meaning
todisarm
him
,
or
at
most
slightly
wound
him
.
<EOS>
Desirous
,
at
length
,
of
putting
an
end
to
the
conflict
,
Randulphassailed
his
adversary
more
vigorously
,
and
was
driving
him
towards
thewall
,
when
footsteps
were
heard
hurrying
along
the
passage
.
<EOS>
Firebrasturned
to
lock
the
door
to
prevent
interruption
,
and
while
he
was
thusengaged
,
Culpepper
made
a
thrust
at
Randulph
,
which
,
fortunately
,
thelatter
was
able
to
avoid
by
a
sudden
spring
backwards
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
by
this
treachery
,
Randulph
dexterously
parried
a
thrust
incarte
from
Philip
,
and
instantly
returning
the
pass
,
his
point
plungeddeeply
into
the
other
's
breast
.
<EOS>
Philip
staggered
,
and
would
have
fallen
,
if
Culpepper
had
not
caught
him
.
<EOS>
"Don't
<EOS>
mind
me
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
wounded
man
,
"
attack
him!--attack
him
!
<EOS>
I'llgive
you
a
thousand
pounds
if
you
kill
him
.
<EOS>
""I
ca
n't
do
it
now

"
whispered
Culpepper
.
<EOS>
"
I
fear
you
're
seriouslyhurt

<EOS>
""Yes
<EOS>
,
it
's
all
over

"
groaned
Phillip
.
"
<EOS>
Curse
him
!
<EOS>
the
luck
's
always
onhis
side
.
<EOS>
"Meanwhile
<EOS>
,
Cordwell
Firebras
had
rushed
up
to
Randulph
,
who
lookedstupified
at
the
result
of
the
encounter
.
<EOS>
"Get
<EOS>
off
as
fast
as
you
can
<EOS>
,
"
he
cried
;
"
it
wo
nt
do
to
be
taken
justnow
.
<EOS>
The
window
in
that
closet
is
open
,
and
you
are
young
and
active
,
and
can
easily
reach
the
ground
.
<EOS>
Repair
to
the
Chequers
at
once
,
andkeep
close
all
day
.
<EOS>
I
'll
be
with
you
before
midnight
.
<EOS>
"Throwing
<EOS>
one
look
of
compassion
at
the
wounded
man
<EOS>
,
Randulph
darted
intothe
closet
,
and
,
peeping
out
of
the
window
,
perceived
that
it
lookedupon
the
roof
of
a
shed
.
<EOS>
Dropping
upon
this
building
,
he
gained
a
narrowalley
,
which
led
him
into
King
Street
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Randulph
had
made
good
his
retreat
,
Firebras
opened
the
door
,
and
gave
admittance
to
the
landlord
and
some
half
-
dozen
attendants
.
<EOS>
A
surgeon
was
instantly
sent
for
,
and
Philip
placed
in
a
chair
,
<EOS>
whileCordwell
Firebras
assisted
in
bandaging
up
the
wound
.
<EOS>
It
bledinternally
,
and
Firebras
's
experience
told
him
it
was
highly
dangerous
.
<EOS>
"What
<EOS>
do
you
think
of
my
hurt
?
"
<EOS>
asked
Philip
,
whose
aspect
had
alreadybecome
ghastly
and
cadaverous
.
<EOS>
"I'll
not
deceive
you
,
"
replied
Firebras
;
"
you
're
a
dead
man
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
my
murderer
will
be
hanged
for
it
,
wo
nt
he
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Philip
,
with
anindignant
look
.
<EOS>
"You
were
fairly
hit
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
If
anybody
deserves
hanging
,
it
's
Captain
Culpepper
.
<EOS>
I
saw
the
foul
blow
he
aimed
at
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"At
<EOS>
this
moment
,
Diggs
entered
the
room
,
and
was
horror
-
stricken
atbeholding
the
condition
of
Philip
Frewin
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
what
dreadful
mischance
is
this
!
"
<EOS>
he
cried
,
gazing
at
him
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
I
hopeyou're
not
seriously
<EOS>
hurt?""They
tell
me
I
am
mortally
wounded
,
"
replied
Philip
,
with
a
groan
;
"
andI
believe
they
're
right
.
<EOS>
I
have
only
been
made
my
uncle
's
heir
to
mockme!""What
,
is
Mr.
Scarve
dead
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Firebras
,
in
surprise,"He
died
last
night
,
"
replied
the
attorney
,
"
and
Mr.
Frewin
,
as
he
hasjust
told
you
,
is
his
heir
--
<EOS>
provided
Hilda
refuses
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
""The
devil
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Firebras
;
"
this
has
been
a
lucky
blow
forRandulph
.
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
he
was
not
aware
of
the
fact
,
or
the
thing
might
havelooked
like
premeditation
.
<EOS>
""Get
me
<EOS>
a
chair
,
Diggs
,
instantly
!
"
cried
Philip
,
"
and
take
me
to
theLittle
Sanctuary
.
<EOS>
I
will
see
Hilda
before
I
die
--
and
if
she
refuses
tomarry
me
,
I
'll
make
my
will
at
once
.
<EOS>
I
have
strength
to
sign
it
.
<EOS>
""What
madness
is
this
?
"
<EOS>
cried
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"It
's
no
madness
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Get
me
a
chair
--
quick
--
<EOS>
quick!"Thus
exhorted
,
Diggs
gave
the
necessary
instructions
,
and
shortlyafterwards
a
chair
was
brought
into
the
room
by
two
porters
and
thewounded
man
placed
in
it
.
<EOS>
Attended
by
Firebras
,
Diggs
,
Culpepper
,
andMr
.
<EOS>
Molson
,
who
chanced
to
be
the
nearest
surgeon
,
and
who
had
justarrived,--he
was
transported
to
the
miser
's
dwelling
.
<EOS>
On
arriving
there
,
Cordwell
Firebras
hastily
explained
to
Jacob
,
whoanswered
the
knock
at
the
door
,
the
object
of
their
coming
,
and
bade
himurge
his
young
mistress
to
see
the
wounded
man
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
hadsatisfied
himself
of
the
truth
of
the
statement
,
which
was
soextraordinary
that
he
could
scarcely
credit
it
,
Jacob
directed
thechairmen
to
bring
their
burthen
along
the
passage
into
the
parlour
,
andPhilip
Frewin
was
got
out
and
placed
in
the
miser
's
old
seat
.
<EOS>
The
chairmen
then
withdrew
,
and
Jacob
ran
up
stairs
to
tell
Hilda
whathad
occurred
,
while
Mr.
Molson
said
to
Philip:"If
you
have
any
instructions
to
give
,
sir
<EOS>
,
you
must
not
lose
time
,
foryou
have
not
many
minutes
to
call
your
own
.
<EOS>
""Where
is
Hilda
?
"
cried
the
wounded
man
,
"
Get
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
Diggs
--
sit
down
--
and
write
what
I
tell
you
.
<EOS>
Is
she
come
yet?""Yes
<EOS>
,
she
is
here
,
"
replied
Firebras
,
as
Hilda
entered
the
room
.
<EOS>
"
MissScarve
,
"
he
added
,
stepping
up
to
her
,
"
your
cousin
has
been
desperatelywounded
in
a
duel
with
Randulph
Crew
.
<EOS>
He
has
not
many
minutes
to
live
.
<EOS>
Accede
to
what
he
proposes
to
you
,
"
he
added
,
in
a
low
tone
.
<EOS>
"Hilda
,
"
said
Philip
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
"
I
have
sent
for
you
to
ask
you
,
in
the
presence
of
these
witnesses
,
whether
you
consent
to
marry
me?""You
are
not
in
a
state
to
ask
the
question
,
"
she
replied
,
with
a
lookof
mingled
commiseration
and
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
"
Think
of
reconciling
yourselfwith
Heaven
.
<EOS>
""Do
<EOS>
you
refuse
?
<EOS>
"
cried
Phillip
,
trying
to
raise
himself
.
<EOS>
"If
<EOS>
you
exert
yourself
in
this
way
,
you
will
only
accelerate
your
end,"said
the
surgeon
.
<EOS>
"I
will
have
an
answer
,
"
replied
Philip--"yes
or
no
.
<EOS>
""Consent
,
"
whispered
Firebras
to
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"
It
can
matter
nothing
.
<EOS>
""I
can
not
bring
my
lips
to
utter
the
word
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"I
require
an
answer
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
said
Diggs
,
"
as
it
may
affect
Mr
.
<EOS>
Frewin
's
interest
in
the
property
,
and
your
own
.
<EOS>
""Then
<EOS>
I
answer
,
no
!
"
<EOS>
she
replied
,
firmly
.
<EOS>
Cordwell
Firebras
bit
hislips
.
<EOS>
"Take
down
that
answer
,
Diggs
,
"
said
Philip
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
complied
,
andwhen
done
,
requested
Culpepper
and
the
surgeon
to
witness
it
,
which
theydid
.
"Now
,
Mr.
Frewin
,
you
are
in
possession
of
your
uncle
's
property
,
"
saidDiggs
.
<EOS>
"Then
,
write
out
a
bequest
of
it
all
,
"
said
Philip,--"of
all
,
mind
--
to
--
to
--
to--""To
<EOS>
whom
,
sir
?
"
asked
Diggs
,
writing
with
the
greatest
rapidity
,
for
hesaw
that
he
had
not
a
moment
to
spare
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
yourself
,
"
faintly
replied
the
dying
man
.
<EOS>
In
a
few
seconds
,
withoutlooking
up
,
or
exhibiting
any
sign
of
satisfaction
,
the
attorneycompleted
his
task
.
<EOS>
"It
is
done
--
sign
it
,
sir
,
"
he
added
,
placing
the
paper
before
Philip
,
and
giving
him
the
pen
,
which
the
latter
could
scarcely
grasp
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
moment
of
breathless
interest
to
all
;
and
even
Hilda
bentforward
.
<EOS>
"Where
<EOS>
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
groaned
Philip
,
trying
to
fix
his
glazing
eyes
on
thepaper
.
<EOS>
"Here
,
sir
--
here
,
"
said
Diggs
,
putting
his
finger
on
the
place
where
thesignature
should
be
affixed
.
<EOS>
But
it
was
too
late
.
<EOS>
The
pen
fell
from
Philip
's
grasp
,
and
falling
withhis
face
on
the
table
,
he
expired
.
<EOS>
"Another
moment
,
and
I
had
been
master
of
this
property
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Diggs
,
snatching
up
the
unsigned
paper
.
<EOS>
"You
could
not
have
kept
it
,
"
said
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Long
enough
to
have
answered
my
purpose
,
"
rejoined
the
attorney
,
putting
on
his
hat
,
and
quitting
the
house
.
<EOS>
He
was
followed
in
hisretreat
by
Captain
Culpepper
.
<EOS>
"You
are
now
undisputed
mistress
of
your
inheritance
,
Hilda
,
"
saidCordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Heaven
be
praised
for
it
!
"
exclaimed
Jacob
.
<EOS>
"
I
knew
such
wrongful
actswould
never
prosper
.
<EOS>
""To
<EOS>
me
<EOS>
the
event
is
most
fortunate
,
"
said
Hilda
;
"
<EOS>
but
I
wish
it
couldhave
been
purchased
at
a
less
price
than
the
life
of
my
unfortunatecousin
.
<EOS>
""I
confess
<EOS>
I
can
not
pity
him
,
"
said
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
But
you
must
now
think
ofyourself
.
<EOS>
You
look
very
pale
.
<EOS>
""This
<EOS>
last
strange
trick
of
fortune
is
almost
too
much
for
me
,
"
sherejoined
.
<EOS>
"I
would
recommend
you
to
seek
an
asylum
with
some
friend

while
thelast
mournful
duties
to
your

are
performed

"
said
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
Whynot
go
to
Mr.
Beechcroft's?--Randulph
's
mother
is
there
.
<EOS>
""I
think
I
will
follow
your
advice
,
"
replied
Hilda
;
"
for
I
can
not
remainhere
after
the
shocking
event

has
just
occurred

<EOS>
""Mrs

I

"And
<EOS>
he
set
out
on
the
errand
,
while
Hilda
went
up
stairs
to
her
room
,
tomake
a
few
hasty
preparations
for
her
departure
.
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
entered
the
room
in
which
her
father
's
remains
were
laid
,
and
kneeling
beside
the
bed
,
prayed
fervently
.
<EOS>
She
then
gazed
for
a
fewmoments
on
his
wan
emaciated
features
,
now
rendered
yet
sharper
bydeath
,
and
pressing
her
lips
upon
them
,
quitted
the
room

<EOS>
CordwellFirebras
led
her
in
silence
to
the
coach
,
in
which
Jacob
put
the
fewthings
she
took
with
her
.
"Where
<EOS>
is
Mr.
Randulph
?
"
<EOS>
asked
the
latter
,
as
he
was
about
to
mount
thebox

<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you

a
summer

""I

springing
on

""You've
nearly
blinded
me
,
you
careless
thing
,
"
replied
the
fairThomasine
,
rubbing
her
eyes
;
"
besides
spoiling
my
fly
-
cap
and
filling
myhair
with
your
nasty
powder
.
<EOS>
But
have
you
heard
the
dreadful
--
thedistressing
news?""No
,
"
replied
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
What
is
it?""Mr
.
<EOS>
Scarve
has
been
found
dead
in
his
cellar
,
"
replied
the
fairThomasine
,
in
a
sepulchral
tone
,
suited
to
the
nature
of
herinformation
,
"
where
he
had
digged
his
own
grave
,
and
tried
to
buryhimself
,
to
save
funeral
expenses
.
<EOS>
""Lord
bless
us
!
<EOS>
you
do
n't
say
so
,
"
exclaimed
Peter
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
I
do
,
"
rejoined
the
fair
Thomasine
;
"
but
turn
your
powder
-
puff
theother
way
,
or
you
'll
miss
your
aim
again
.
<EOS>
I
should
n't
have
been
sorryfor
anything
that
happened
to
him
--
but
what
do
you
think?--he'sdisinherited
his
own
daughter
,
and
left
all
his
property
to
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
""Oh
,
the
horrid
,
unnatural
old
monster
!
"
<EOS>
exclaimed
Peter
,
caperingabout
,
and
completely
emptying
the
powder
-
puff
in
his
agitation
.
<EOS>
"Be
<EOS>
quiet
do
,
and
stand
still
<EOS>
,
"
said
the
fair
Thomasine
,
taking
hold
ofhis
collar
and
keeping
him
down
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Poor
Hilda
's
not
to
have
a
farthing
,
unless
she
marries
that
odious
cousin
of
hers
;
and
if
I
'm
not
greatlymistaken
in
her
,
she
'll
die
sooner
than
consent
.
<EOS>
""Of
course
she
will
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
,
still
plying
the
exhaustedpowder
-
puff
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Oh
she
's
a
noble
creature
,
and
quite
an
example
to
hersex!""So
<EOS>
I
think
,
"
replied
the
fair
Thomasine
;
"
and
till
she
marries
RandulphCrew
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
marry
you
--
<EOS>
that
's
positive
.
<EOS>
Oh
,
gemini
!
<EOS>
if
there
is
n't
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps
!
<EOS>
How
altered
he
is
,
to
be
<EOS>
sure!"The
latter
exclamation
was
occasioned
by
the
entrance
of
the
ex
-
valet
,
who
was
indeed
so
much
changed
as
scarcely
to
be
recognisable
.
<EOS>
His
coatwas
threadbare
,
out
-
at
-
elbows
,
and
with
the
lace
upon
it
tarnished
;
hiswaistcoat
was
in
the
same
tattered
condition
;
his
nether
garments
werebepatched
with
cloths
of
various
hues
;
his
hose
were
no
longer
silk
,
butcotton
very
much
darned
;
and
steel
buckles
replaced
the
diamondappendages
to
his
shoes
.
<EOS>
His
dishevelled
peruke
stood
sadly
in
need
ofthe
aid
of
Peter
Pokerich
;
his
hat
was
an
old
cocked
one
,
with
one
ofthe
sides
broken
and
hanging
loose
;
and
a
switch
supplied
the
place
ofhis
clouded
cane
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
lace
at
his
wrists
or
at
his
breast
;
indeed
,
it
was
rather
questionable
,
from
the
manner
in
which
he
buttoned
up
hiscoat
,
whether
he
had
a
shirt
at
all
.
<EOS>
Fallen
,
however
,
as
he
was
,
Mr

<EOS>
Cripps
was
Mr.
Cripps
still
.
<EOS>
He
wore
his
tattered
apparel
with
as
greatan
air
as
distinguished
him
when
equipped
in
all
his
finery
;
flourishedhis
switch
as
if
it
had
been
a
magnificent
baton
;
took
snuff
out
of
apewter
box
with
as
much
grace
as
when
he
manipulated
one
set
withbrilliants
;
and
brushed
away
the
powder
with
a
ragged
handkerchief
asairily
as
when
he
boasted
a
perfumed
and
embroidered
mouchoir
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
fair
Thomasine
,
as
I
live
<EOS>

"
he
said
,
with
a
diving
bow
;
"
howcharmingly

<EOS>
I
've
just
been
to
Sir
Singleton
Spinke's
,
to
offer
myself
as
his
valet

<EOS>
But
he
has
heard
of
my
cursed
adventure
,
and
wo
nt
engage
me
.
<EOS>
""Did
<EOS>
you
see
Lady
Spinke
?
"
asked
the
fair
Thomasine
.
<EOS>
"To
be

replied
Mr.

can
report
very

""Except

interposed
Peter
.
<EOS>
"
I
wish
my
powder

he
added
,
aside
;
"
I
'd
empty
it
into

mischievous

him

<EOS>
""Young

cried
Mr.
Cripps
.
"
<EOS>
Lady
Spinke
is
a

<EOS>
She

pursued
Mr

I
heard

talking

<EOS>
""Ranelagh

sighed
the

"
<EOS>
How

I

Mr.

"Lasts

cried
the

"Why

Mr.

with

<EOS>
"A
person
entering
the
shop
at
this
moment
,
Mr.
Cripps
walked
aside
,
while
the
barber
,
offering
his
customer
a
chair
,
went
into
the
back

roomin
search
of
a
full

bottomed
black

<EOS>
On
more
narrowly
examining
thenew
comer

Mr.
Cripps
recognised
the
Jesuit
priest
,
Father
Verselyn
,
andit
instantly
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
turn
the
discovery
toaccount
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
stepped
quickly
up
to
him
,
and
said
in
a
lowtone:"Glad
to
see
you

Father
Verselyn

<EOS>

sit
still

<EOS>
How
gets
on

replied
the
priest
,
uneasily

<EOS>
"I
will
soon
prove
the

rejoined
Mr.

assuming
adifferent
tone

<EOS>
Unless

"The
<EOS>
priest
trembled
violently
.
<EOS>
"Answer
<EOS>
me
directly

"
cried
Mr.
Cripps
,
"
or
I
call
the
barber
to

<EOS>
""At
<EOS>
the
Chequers

replied
the
priest

<EOS>
"I'll
have

Mr.

Whenis

<EOS>
"Now

I
tell

said
Mr.
Cripps
,
"
I
can

<EOS>
You

<EOS>
Do
you

consent?"The
Jesuit
nodded

<EOS>
Having
settled
his
affairs
with
the
barber
,
Father
Verselyn
quitted
theshop
,
while
Mr.
Cripps
,
making
a
sign
to
Peter
that
he
had
business
onhand
,
instantly
followed
him

and
soon
found
that
there
was

provided
hecould
do
so
with

<EOS>
Discussing
their

,
they
proceeded
towards
Millbank

and
it
wasarranged

on
the
suggestion
of

that
the
landlord

who
was
no

the
former

AT
THE
CHEQUERS
--
THE
OLD
MILL
--
RANDULPH
OVERHEARS
THEPLOT
--
DISPERSION
OF
THE
JACOBITE
CLUB
,
AND
THE
FATE
OF
CORDWELLFIREBRAS.As
Randulph
<EOS>
passed
through
the
Little
Sanctuary
,
on
his
way
to
Millbank
,
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
the
dwelling
of
the
unfortunate
miser
.
<EOS>
Ignorant
of
the
catastrophe
that
had
occurred
there
during
the
night
,
hecould
not
help
thinking
that
the
house
had
a
drearier
look
than
usual;but
attributing
the
notion
to
his
own
gloomy
thoughts
,
he
attachedlittle
importance
to
it
,
and
passed
on
.
<EOS>
On
gaining
Millbank
,
he
speedily
discovered
the
Chequers
,
and
enteringthe
house
,
recognised
his
old
acquaintance
,
the
former
landlord
of
theRose
and
Crown
.
<EOS>
The
latter
,
however
,
did
not
recollect
him
,
but
eyed
himrather
suspiciously
,
till
Randulph
told
him
he
came
recommended
by
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"Hush
!
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
the
host
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
only
known
as
Captain
Vizard
here
.
<EOS>
Myright
name
is
Tom
Wiles
,
but
I
'm
now
called
Dick
Chinnock
.
<EOS>
I
fancy
I'veseen
<EOS>
you
before
,
sir
.
<EOS>
""I
was
introduced
to
the
club
when
it
met
at
your
house
in
Gardiner'sStreet
,
Petty
France
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
"
on
the
night
when
the
memberswere
pursued
by
the
guard
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
an
unlucky
night
it
was
!
"
exclaimed
Chinnock
.
<EOS>
"
We
've
neverprospered
since
.
<EOS>
I
remember
you
now
.
<EOS>
I
hope
you
wo
nt
bring
the
same
illluck
again
.
<EOS>
How
soon
will
the
captain
be
here
,
sir?""Not
before
midnight
,
I
believe
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
"
and
as
I
'm
a
gooddeal
<EOS>
fatigued
,
I
should
like
to
go
to
bed
for
a
few
hours
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
beas
private
as
possible
.
<EOS>
""I'll
get
a
room
ready
for
you
directly
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
host
;
"
and
inthe
meantime
,
perhaps
you
'll
step
this
way
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
passing
through
a
back
door
,
he
crossed
a
little
garden
,
at
thelower
end
of
which
stood
a
little
square
summer
-
house
,
with
a
pointed
,
tiled
roof
,
surmounted
by
a
vane
.
<EOS>
It
overlooked
the
river
,
and
on
thisside
there
was
a
platform
,
protected
by
a
railing
,
with
steps
descendingto
the
water
's
edge
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
stood
an
old
mill
--
a
tall
,
picturesque
,
wooden
structure
.
<EOS>
Between
the
summer
-
house
and
the
mill
flowed
a
smallbrook
,
which
turned
a
large
water
-
wheel
,
connected
with
the
latterbuilding
.
<EOS>
At
the
back
of
the
mill
,
over
a
dense
mass
of
habitations
,
could
be
distinguished
the
towers
of
Westminster
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Having
shewn
Randulph
into
the
summer
-
house
,
the
landlord
promised
tolet
him
know
as
soon
as
his
bed
was
ready
,
and
left
him
.
<EOS>
The
littlechamber
was
furnished
with
a
small
deal
table
painted
green
,
and
acouple
of
chairs
.
<EOS>
Its
internal
decorations
were
much
injured
by
damp
andneglect
.
<EOS>
The
gay
paintings
on
the
walls
and
ceilings
were
nearlyeffaced
;
the
gilding
had
turned
black
;
and
the
looking
glasses
were
sodim
that
they
scarcely
reflected
an
object
.
<EOS>
As
Randulph
,
after
taking
amomentary
survey
of
the
room
,
was
about
to
seat
himself
,
he
noticed
aring
in
the
floor
,
concealed
by
a
bit
of
carpet
,
which
he
removed
,
andperceived
that
it
covered
a
trap
-
door
.
<EOS>
Impelled
by
curiosity
,
he
liftedthe
latter
by
means
of
the
ring
,
and
discovered
a
lower
chamber
,
accessible
by
a
ladder
,
placed
against
the
stout
pile
supporting
thefloor
.
<EOS>
There
appeared
to
be
nothing
in
it
;
and
satisfied
with
thediscovery
he
had
made
,
Randulph
closed
the
trap
-
door
,
and
restored
thecarpet
to
its
original
position
.
<EOS>
Drawing
his
chair
to
a
little
window
on
the
left
,
he
threw
it
open
,
andamused
himself
by
examining
the
old
mill
.
<EOS>
A
small
vessel
was
moored
infront
of
it
,
apparently
filled
with
sacks
of
corn
and
straw
,
which
someof
the
crew
were
unloading
.
<EOS>
While
watching
their
proceedings
,
Randulph
could
not
help
suspecting(though
he
scarcely
knew
why
,
)
that
some
underhand
business
was
goingforward
.
<EOS>
The
sacks
were
teagled
to
the
upper
story
of
the
mill
,
and
oneof
them
chancing
to
fall
,
proved
by
its
sound
that
its
contents
were
notwhat
<EOS>
they
seemed
.
<EOS>
The
trusses
of
straw
,
too
,
seemed
oddly
shaped
,
andRandulph
persuaded
himself
that
muskets
and
other
arms
were
concealedwithin
them
.
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
felt
quite
certain
that
these
proceedings
had
someconnexion
with
the
Jacobite
cause
,
a
circumstance
that
occurred
almostimmediately
afterwards
would
have
satisfied
him
of
the
fact
.
<EOS>
One
of
thecrew
in
the
little
vessel
observing
him
at
the
window
of
thesummer
-
house
made
various
signs
to
him
,
which
,
though
he
could
notprecisely
interpret
he
understood
to
bear
relation
to
the
articles
theywere
landing
,
as
well
as
to
their
object
.
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
,
Mr.
Chinnock
presented
himself
,
and
apologizing
for
hisdelay
,
said:--"The
<EOS>
only
bed
-
room
I
have
is
engaged
by
an
invalid
,
butI've
made
you
up
a
nice
bed
on
a
sofa
in
a
snug
little
closet
,
where
noone
will
disturb
you
.
<EOS>
"Following
<EOS>
the
host
into
the
house
,
Randulph
was
shewn
into
a
closetopening
from
a
larger
room
,
where
,
as
had
been
stated
,
a
sofa
bed
wasprepared
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
upon
it
,
without
undressing
,
and
presentlyfell
asleep
.
<EOS>
How
long
he
remained
in
this
state
he
knew
not
,
but
he
wasawakened
by
the
sound
of
muttered
voices
in
the
next
apartment
,
andbecame
an
involuntary
listener
to
their
discourse
.
<EOS>
"They
will
all
be
here
at
midnight
,
"
said
a
voice
,
"
and
you
may
capturethem
without
difficulty
.
<EOS>
""If
<EOS>
we
do
,
sir
,
"
replied
another
,
"
your
reward
is
certain
,
though
youare
a
Jesuit
priest
.
<EOS>
I
shall
bring
a
strong
party
of
men
with
me
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
'll
take
care
to
admit
them
,
"
said
a
third
,
whose
voice
Randulphrecognised
as
that
of
the
landlord
,
"
provided
you
promise
me
a
third
ofthe
reward
,
and
undertake
that
I
shall
not
be
implicated
in
the
matter
.
<EOS>
""I
give
you
my
word
,
as
an
officer
in
his
majesty
's
grenadier
guards
,
that
it
shall
be
so
,
"
rejoined
the
previous
speaker
,
"
and
that
is
betterthan
the
written
engagement
of
any
Jacobite
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
reward
is
three
hundred
pounds
,
"
said
a
sharp
,
conceited
voice
.
<EOS>
"That
's
one
hundred
to
Mr.
Chinnock
,
another
hundred
to
Father
Verselyn
,
and
a
third
to
me
.
<EOS>
Is
that
distinctly
understood?""Distinctly
,
Mr.
Cripps
,
"
replied
the
officer--"provided
<EOS>
I
take
them
.
<EOS>
""Yes
,
of
course
,
"
said
the
landlord
;
"
<EOS>
but
you
ca
n't
fail
to
do
so
<EOS>
,
ifyou
follow
my
instructions
.
<EOS>
I
'll
put
them
into
your
hands
.
<EOS>
""Can't
<EOS>
you
come
down
with
something
beforehand
,
captain
?
"
asked
Mr
.
Cripps
.
"Not
<EOS>
with
a
crown
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
I
have
already
pledged
my
wordthat
you
shall
receive
the
reward
,
and
that
must
content
you
.
<EOS>
It
is
asmuch
as
traitors
can
expect
,
"
he
added
,
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
.
<EOS>
"You'll
take
care
<EOS>
I
am
not
injured
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
Jesuit
.
<EOS>
"I'll
do
my
best
,
"
replied
the
officer
;
"
but
you
must
look
to
yourself
.
<EOS>
And
now
to
arrange
our
plans
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
it
gets
dark
,
I
'll
placehalf
-
a
-
dozen
of
my
grenadiers
,
under
the
care
of
Tom
Pratt
,
(
Long
Tom
,
as
the
men
call
him
)
in
the
summer
-
house
near
the
river
.
<EOS>
They
'll
cut
offtheir
retreat
,
if
any
should
be
attempted
,
by
that
way
.
<EOS>
""Long
<EOS>
Tom
and
his
men
must
hide
themselves
in
the
lower
room
of
thesummer
-
house
,
till
Captain
Vizard
<EOS>
--
I
mean
Cordwell
Firebras
has
made
hissearch
,
"
said
Chinnock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
He
's
sure
to
be
here
the
first
,
and
if
he'sseized
too
soon
,
you
may
lose
the
others
.
<EOS>
""I
must
have
the
whole
pack
,
or
you
do
n't
get
the
reward
,
"
said
theofficer
.
<EOS>
"There
's
a
young
man
asleep
in
that
closet
,
sent
by
the
captain
,
"
saidthe
landlord--"I'm
not
quite
sure
that
he
's
a
Jacobite
.
<EOS>
What
shall
we
dowith
<EOS>
him?""Detain
him
,
"
replied
the
officer
.
<EOS>
"
I
hold
you
responsible
for
his
safecustody
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
he
's
a
stout
resolute
fellow
,
"
said
Chinnock
,
"
and
may
get
off
inspite
of
me
.
<EOS>
""I'll
<EOS>
leave
you
a
couple
of
my
grenadiers
,
"
replied
theofficer;--"they'll
remain
in
the
bar
,
like
chance
customers
.
<EOS>
Call
them
,
if
you
require
assistance
.
"After
<EOS>
a
little
further
conversation
,
which
Randulph
could
not
catch
,
they
separated
,
and
he
began
to
reflect
upon
the
new
posture
of
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
involved
in
a
fresh
difficulty
,
from
which
he
did
not
see
howhe
could
escape
.
<EOS>
Though
anxious
to
warn
Cordwell
Firebras
and
the
otherJacobites
of
their
danger
,
he
felt
it
would
be
almost
impracticable
.
<EOS>
Anyattempt
at
flight
from
the
house
must
be
attended
with
great
risk
,
afterthe
precautions
taken
by
the
others
to
prevent
it
,
and
he
finallyresolved
to
let
things
take
their
course
,
and
to
be
guided
in
his
planof
action
by
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
to
ascertain
whether
his
movements
were
watched
,
hewalked
forth
,
and
proceeded
towards
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
host
wasinstantly
by
his
side
,
and
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
Mr.
Cripps
in
thedoorway
,
and
behind
him
the
two
grenadiers
.
<EOS>
Taking
no
sort
of
notice
ofthese
hostile
preparations
,
he
talked
indifferently
to
the
landlord
,
andpresently
returned
with
him
to
the
house
,
and
ordered
some
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Evening
at
length
arrived
,
and
as
it
grew
dusk
,
Randulph
gazed
into
thegarden
,
and
perceived
the
figures
of
the
grenadiers
,
headed
by
Long
Tom
,
steal
off
towards
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
He
also
fancied
he
saw
othersstation
themselves
at
the
side
of
the
brook
running
between
the
inngarden
and
the
mill
yard
,
and
he
had
no
doubt
the
street
-
door
wasguarded
in
a
similar
manner
.
<EOS>
The
trap
was
thus
completely
set
,
and
hetrembled
to
think
what
might
be
the
fate
of
those
for
whom
,
however
hediffered
with
them
in
political
opinions
,
he
still
entertained
a
strongfriendship
.
<EOS>
Slowly
as
the
hours
had
hitherto
passed
,
the
interval
between
this
timeand
that
appointed
for
the
arrival
of
Cordwell
Firebras
appeared
yetmore
tedious
.
<EOS>
Twelve
o'clock
came
--
half
-
past
--
and
yet
none
of
the
clubhad
arrived
;
and
Randulph
began
to
hope
that
they
had
received
someintimation
of
the
plot
against
them
.
<EOS>
The
same
idea
apparently
occurredto
the
landlord
,
for
he
became
very
fidgety
,
and
kept
coming
constantlyinto
Randulph
's
room
,
asking
whether
he
knew
what
could
be
the
cause
<EOS>
ofCaptain
Vizard
's
being
so
late
.
<EOS>
"I'm
<EOS>
afraid
something
must
have
happened
to
him
and
the
othergentlemen
<EOS>
,
"
he
said
;
"
the
Captain
is
punctuality
itself
,
and
so
indeedare
they
all
.
<EOS>
I
wonder
what
can
have
occurred
.
<EOS>
""Perhaps
they
may
have
been
betrayed
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
hope
not
!
"
cried
the
landlord--"if
<EOS>
so
,
I
should
lose
--
my
bestfriends
,
"
he
added
,
correcting
himself
hastily
.
<EOS>
"Do
<EOS>
you
expect
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
tonight
?
"
asked
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
did
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
landlord
,
"
but
I
do
n't
know
what
to
thinknow
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
and
Father
Verselyn?""Both
,
sir
,
"
was
the
reply
.
<EOS>
"Any
<EOS>
others
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
inquired
Randulph,"Several
,
I
believe
,
"
returned
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"
A
very
full
meeting
of
theclub
was
expected
.
<EOS>
What
can
have
kept
them
away?--Ah
!
<EOS>
as
I
live
!
<EOS>
that'sthe
captain
's
voice
.
<EOS>
All
's
right
now
.
<EOS>
"So
<EOS>
saying
,
he
rushed
out
,
and
presently
afterwards
returned
,
ushering
inCordwell
Firebras
.
<EOS>
The
latter
looked
greatly
exhausted
.
<EOS>
"Give
me
<EOS>
a
cup
of
wine
,
landlord
,
"
<EOS>
he
said--"I
feel
faint
.
<EOS>
I
've
had
somehard
work
to
do
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
host
instantly
flew
to
a
cupboard
,
and
produced
a
flask
and
a
largeglass
.
<EOS>
Filling
the
latter
,
he
presented
it
to
Firebras
,
who
emptied
itat
a
draught
.
<EOS>
"You
are
late
,
to
-
night
,
Captain
,
"
said
the
landlord
;
"
I
had
almostgiven
you
up
.
<EOS>
Will
the
rest
of
the
gentlemen
be
here?""I
expect
so
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
I
thought
they
would
have
been
herebefore
me
.
<EOS>
Have
you
looked
into
the
garden
and
<EOS>
the
summer
-
house?""I
have
,
"
replied
the
landlord
.
<EOS>
"I'll
go
there
myself
,
"
said
the
other
,
taking
a
brace
of
pistols
fromhis
pocket
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Stay
where
you
are
,
"
he
added
to
Randulph
,
who
was
about
tofollow
him
.
<EOS>
Accompanied
by
the
host
,
who
carried
a
lantern
,
Firebras
crossed
thegarden
,
but
though
he
glanced
around
,
he
perceived
nothing
,
and
marcheddirect
to
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
On
approaching
it
,
Chinnock
ran
forward
,
and
pretending
to
try
the
door
,
drew
out
the
key
,
crying
,
so
as
to
be
heard
by
those
inside--"Dear
me!it
's
locked
--
wait
a
minute
,
sir
,
and
I
'll
fetch
the
key
.
<EOS>
"Without
<EOS>
pausing
for
a
reply
,
he
darted
off
to
the
house
.
<EOS>
In
a
couple
ofminutes
he
returned
,
apologizing
to
Firebras
--
whom
he
found
impatientlypacing
the
platform
in
front
of
the
summer
-
house
,
and
gazing
at
thedarkling
tide
flowing
past
him
--
for
his
delay
;
and
unlocked
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
summer
-
house
was
empty
;
the
grenadiers
had
taken
the
hint
,
anddescended
to
the
lower
chamber
.
<EOS>
A
glance
satisfied
Firebras
that
all
wasright
,
and
he
returned
slowly
to
the
house
,
the
landlord
stamping
uponthe
floor
as
he
quitted
the
building
,
as
a
signal
to
the
grenadiers
thatthey
may
now
come
forth
from
their
concealment
.
<EOS>
On
reaching
the
house
,
Firebras
dismissed
the
landlord
,
and
going
up
toRandulph
,
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
,
and
said
:
"
I
have
rare
news
foryou
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
I
have
news
for
you
,
"
replied
the
other
.
<EOS>
"Hear
<EOS>
mine
first
,
"
cried
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
What
if
I
tell
you
I
am
come
tooffer
you
your
estates
and
the
hand
of
Hilda
,
if
you
join
the
Jacobiteparty?""There
would
be
no
use
in
joining
you
now
,
"
returned
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"You
think
I
am
trifling
with
you
,
"
cried
Firebras
,
producing
a
packet;"but
this
will
speak
to
the
contrary
.
<EOS>
Here
is
the
assignment
of
yourestates
to
Isaac
Isaacs
.
<EOS>
A
receipt
in
full
of
all
claims
is
attached
toit
.
<EOS>
The
deed
is
yours
,
provided
you
join
us
.
<EOS>
""You
amaze
me
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Randulph
,
gazing
at
the
packet
;
"
that
isunquestionably
the
deed
I
executed
.
<EOS>
""Most
<EOS>
certainly
it
is
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
too
long
a
story
totell
you
<EOS>
how
I
became
possessed
of
it
,
"
he
added
,
replacing
it
in
hispocket
,
"
but
I
have
other
intelligence
for
you
.
<EOS>
Mr.
Scarve
is
dead!"Randulph
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
.
<EOS>
"He
died
last
night
,
"
pursued
Firebras
,
"
and
left
his
property
to
PhilipFrewin
,
in
case
of
Hilda
's
refusal
to
marry
him
.
<EOS>
""But
<EOS>
Philip
may
not
live
to
claim
the
fulfilment
of
the
condition,"cried
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Philip
,
also
,
is
dead
,
"
replied
Firebras
.
<EOS>
And
smiling
at
Randulph'sastonishment
,
he
added
,
"
Now
you
see
that
all
is
in
your
grasp
.
<EOS>
Fate
hasgiven
you

lady
of
your

I
offer

<EOS>
Can
yourefuse
to
join
us?""Mr
.
<EOS>
Firebras
,
"
said
Randulph
,
composing
himself
,
"
this
is
not
a
time
toput
such
a
question
to
me
.
<EOS>
""Pardon
me
,
"
cried
Firebras
,
sternly

I

Do

I
can

will
make
good
my

<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
mistake
me
altogether
,
"
rejoined
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
I
mean
to
say
that
itwould
be
useless
in
me
to
assent

<EOS>
You
are
betrayed!""Betrayed
!
"
exclaimed
Firebras
,
in
a
voice
of
thunder
,
"
How
!
<EOS>
by
whom?But
this
is
a
mere
assertion
made
to
turn
me
from
my
purpose

<EOS>
""You
will
find
it
too
true

"
replied
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The

environedon

""I

There

""The

Randulph

<EOS>
"It

cried
Firebras

with
a
terrible
imprecation

Thelandlord

""He

replied
Randulph

"
<EOS>
Your

You

the

said
Firebras
.
<EOS>
"
There
is
a
boat
at
hand

forI
ordered
Jacob
Post
to
be
in
waiting
for
you
off

I
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
just
now
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
here
comeour

<EOS>
"And
as
he
spoke
,
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
,
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
FatherVerselyn
,
Mr.
Travers
,
and
four
or
five
other
gentlemen
,
entered
theroom
.
<EOS>
"Leave
<EOS>
us
,
landlord
<EOS>
,
"
said
Firebras
;
"
we
will
call
you
when
we
wantyou
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
the
order
being
obeyed
,
he
bolted
the
door
.
<EOS>
"We
are
betrayed
,
gentlemen
,
"
said
Firebras
,
in
a
low
tone
;
"
the
houseis
surrounded
by
guards
,
and
our
retreat
is
cut
off
by
the
river
.
<EOS>
"As
<EOS>
the
words
were
uttered
,
the
door
was
tried
by
some
persons
without
,
who
finding
it
fastened
,
proceeded
to
burst
it
open
.
<EOS>
"To
<EOS>
the
garden
!
<EOS>
to
the
garden
!
"
cried
Firebras
.
<EOS>
And
the
party
made
for
the
window
.
<EOS>
Before
,
however
,
the
whole
of
themcould
pass
through
it
,
the
officer
and
a
party
of
grenadiers
burst
openthe
door
,
and
endeavoured
to
seize
them
.
<EOS>
Firebras
and
the
others
,
withthe
exception
of
Randulph
,
drew
their
swords
,
and
the
next
instant
,
anencounter
took
place
.
<EOS>
But
as
all
was
buried
in
darkness
,
little
mischiefwas
done
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
soldiers
to
prevent
them
,
five
or
six
ofthe
Jacobites
contrived
to
get
across
the
ditch
,
and
gaining
the
mill
,
took
shelter
within
it
.
<EOS>
They
were
followed
by
a
party
of
grenadiers
,
whofired
a
few
shots
at
them
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
circumstance
was
the
result
ofaccident
or
design
is
immaterial
,
but
a
few
minutes
afterwards
,
the
millwas
found
to
be
on
fire
.
<EOS>
Flames
burst
from
the
upper
windows
,
throwing
afierce
glare
on
the
groups
below
,
and
brightly
illuminating
the
towersof
Westminster
Abbey
.
<EOS>
Repeated
loud
explosions
were
next
heard
,
threatening
each
moment
toshake
the
mill
to
pieces
,
while
some
of
the
unfortunate
Jacobites
wereseen
springing
from
a
side
window
upon
the
water
-
wheel
,
and
trying
todescend
by
it
.
<EOS>
Two
others
,
at
the
risk
of
breaking
their
necks
,
droppedfrom
a
window
facing
the
river
,
and
endeavoured
to
gain
the
vesselmoored
beside
it
.
<EOS>
The
fugitives
on
the
water
-
wheel
were
held
in
check
by
a
party
ofgrenadiers
,
who
,
having
thrown
a
couple
of
planks
over
the
littlestream
,
were
enabled
to
reach
them
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
favoured
by
the
previous
darkness
,
for
all
was
now
bright
asday
,
Firebras
,
Salusbury
,
and
the
rest
of
the
Jacobites
,
had
made
goodtheir
retreat
as
far
as
the
summer
-
house
;
some
of
them
even
managed
toforce
their
way
to
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Here
a
desperate
struggle
took
place
,
in
which
Sir
Norfolk
was
severely
wounded
in
the
side
by
a
bayonet
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
fire
had
broken
out
in
the
mill
,
and
its
glare
shewedJacob
at
a
little
distance
in
a
skiff
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
menaces
ofthe
soldiers
,
who
pointed
their
guns
at
him
,
and
threatened
to
fire
,
ifhe
approached
nearer
,
Jacob
pushed
resolutely
towards
the
summer
-
house
.
<EOS>
He
was
now
close
under
the
platform
,
and
made
signs
to
Randulph
todescend
;
but
the
latter
would
not
desert
Sir
Norfolk
,
who
had
beenseized
by
a
couple
of
grenadiers
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
upon
the
oldbaronet
's
captors
,
and
,
in
the
struggle
that
ensued
,
the
railing
gaveway
,
precipitating
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
the
Jesuit
,
and
the
grenadiersinto
the
tide
.
<EOS>
Before
the
other
soldiers
had
recovered
from
theirsurprise
at
this
occurrence
,
Randulph
had
lowered
Sir
Norfolk
into
theskiff
,
and
sprung
in
after
him
.
<EOS>
Jacob
's
efforts
to
push
off
were
impeded
by
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
,
whoclung
to
the
stern
of
the
skiff
,
earnestly
imploring
them
to
take
himin
.
<EOS>
Father
Verselyn
caught
hold
of
the
steps
,
and
apprehensive
of
somefurther
disaster
,
crept
along
the
side
of
the
summer
-
house
,
and
tookrefuge
in
a
small
sewer
,
in
the
slime
of
which
it
is
supposed
heperished
,
for
he
was
never
heard
of
more
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Cordwell
Firebras,--engaged
hand
to
hand
with
the
officer
,
who
,
having
vainly
summoned
him
to
surrender
,
attacked
him
inperson,--had
reached
the
platform
.
<EOS>
Seeing
escape
impossible
,
Firebras
,
while
defending
himself
against
the
officer
,
called
to
Randulph
,
whom
hedescried
below
,
and
held
out
the
packet
to
him
.
<EOS>
The
latter
ordered
Jacobto
keep
the
skiff
steady
,
and
to
bring
it
as
near
the
combatants
aspossible
.
<EOS>
While
Jacob
obeyed
the
injunction
,
a
successful
thrust
from
Firebrasstretched
his
adversary
upon
the
platform
,
but
the
next
moment
hereceived
his
own
death
wound
from
Long
Tom
,
who
stepped
forward
,
as
hisofficer
fell
,
and
discharged
his
musket
into
his
breast
.
<EOS>
With
a
dying
effort
,
Firebras
stretched
his
hand
over
the
rail
,
andconsigning
the
packet
to
Randulph
,
fell
backwards
into
the
water
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
the
packet
,
Randulph
turned
to
the
aid
of
Sir
BulkeleyPrice
,
and
pulling
him
into
the
skiff
,
Jacob
instantly
pushed
off
.
<EOS>
Assisted
by
the
stream
,
which
ran
very
strong
,
they
soon
got
under
thesides
of
the
vessel
near
the
mill
,
and
were
sheltered
from
the
fire
ofthe
soldiery
.
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
the
conflagration
raged
fast
and
furiously
,
and
before
theskiff
containing
the
fugitives
had
got
half
way
to
Westminster
bridge
,
atremendous
explosion
took
place
,
scattering
the
blazing
fragments
of
theold
mill
far
and
wide
into
the
river
.

CHAPTER
XVII.--IN
<EOS>
WHICH
<EOS>
THE
WEDDING
-
DAY
IS
FIXED.About
three
months
after
the
events
detailed
in
the
preceding
chapter
,
afamily
party
were
assembled
in
the
dining
-
room
of
the
house
at
Lambeth
,
consisting
of
Abel
Trussell
,
Mrs.
Crew
,
and
Hilda
.
<EOS>
The
latter
wasdressed
in
deep
mourning
,
and
had
a
shade
of
melancholy
on
hercountenance
,
which
rather
added
to
her
beauty
than
detracted
from
it
.
<EOS>
She
sat
near
Abel
Beechcroft
,
who
regarded
her
with
paternal
affection
,
and
whose
features
,
having
lost
their
somewhat
cynical
and
saturninecast
,
now
expressed
only
benevolence
and
kindliness
.
<EOS>
Always
placid
andcomposed
,
Mrs.
Crew
looked
more
cheerful
than
before
;
Trussell
,
who
,
indeed
,
was
rarely
out
of
humour
,
appeared
in
tip
-
top
spirits
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
a
happier
party
never
met
together
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
their
attendant
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
appear
a
whit
less
contented
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
my
dear
niece
,
"
said
<EOS>
Trussell,--"for
<EOS>
so
I
shall
make
bold
to
callyou
,
in
anticipation
of
our
intended
relationship
--
we
shall
certainlyhave
Randulph
back
to
-
day
.
<EOS>
""This
morning
,
do
you
think
?
<EOS>
"
she
rejoined
.
<EOS>
"Why
,
no
,
possibly
not
till
evening
,
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Ah
,
sir
,
"
headded
,
to
Abel
,
"
how
different
our
nephew
's
present
journey
fromCheshire
is
from
the
last
.
<EOS>
Then
he
came
with
very
little
money
in
hispocket
,
and
very
little
prospect
of
getting
any
--
deprived
of
hisinheritance
,
and
with
no
apparent
prospect
of
its
restitution
.
<EOS>
Now
hearrives
a
wealthy
man
,
with
a
prospect
of
such
happiness
before
him
as
aking
might
envy!""It
's
a
story
to
write
in
a
book
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
,
rubbing
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"I
fear
the
two
months
during
which
Randulph
has
been
absent
,
must
havepassed
very
slowly
over
your
head
,
Hilda
?
<EOS>
"
observed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"
I
may
ask
youthe
question
now
that
we
shall
so
soon
have
him
with
us
again
.
<EOS>
""To
say
that
I
have
not
felt
his
absence
,
and
wished
for
his
return
,
would
not
be
to
speak
the
truth
,
sir
,
"
she
replied
;
"
but
it
would
beequally
untrue
to
say
that
I
have
not
been
happier
during
the
period
youmention
than
I
ever
was
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
How
,
indeed
,
could
it
be
otherwise
,
when
I
have
experienced
so
much
attention
from
you
,
from
your
brother
,
and
from
Mrs.
Crew?""I'm
<EOS>
sure
there
is
nothing
we
would
n't
do
to
make
you
happy
,
"
said
Mrs
.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"Nothing
!
"
cried
Mr.
Jukes
,
emphatically
"
nothing
we
would
n't
do
.
<EOS>
""I
beg
pardon
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
"
said
Hilda
;
"
I
ought
to
have
included
you
inthe
list
of
my
kind
friends
.
<EOS>
""You
<EOS>
make
me
proud
to
hear
you
say
so
,
"
replied
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
"
I
told
mymaster
,
long
before
things
came
to
this
,
that
nothing
would
make
me
sohappy
as
to
see
you
in
this
house
,
married
to
Mr.
Randulph
.
<EOS>
And
I
toldhim
also
that
we
would
have
one
of
the
upper
rooms
turned
into
anursery
,
and
that
he
should
sit
in
an
easy
chair
,
nursing
a
littleRandulph
,
or
a
little
Abel
,
as
the
case
may
be
,
with
a
Miss
Hilda
,
or
aMiss
Sophia
playing
beside
him
.
<EOS>
Did
n't
I
tell
you
that
,
sir?""You
did
--
you
did
,
"
replied
Abel
,
hastily
.
<EOS>
"Get
<EOS>
me
some
usquebaugh
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
"
said
Trussell
,
who
almost
chokedhimself
with
laughing
at
the
butler
's
speech
,
while
Hilda
was
coveredwith
blushes
,
and
<EOS>
Mrs.
Crew
looked
a
little
confused
.
<EOS>
The
order
was
promptly
obeyed
,
and
Trussell
,
as
he
raised
the
glass
tohis
lips
,
said--"May
I
live
to
see
the
realization
of
Mr.
Jukes
's
wish!""I
must
drink
that
toast
myself
,
"
said
the
butler
,
retiring
to
thesideboard
.
<EOS>
"By
<EOS>
-
the
-
bye
,
Hilda
,
"
said
Trussell
,
laughing
,
"
<EOS>
I
have
n't
told
you
whathas
become
of
your
disconsolate
suitor
,
Beau
Villiers
,
who
would
n't
becontent
till
you
had
refused
him
half
-
a
-
dozen
times
?
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
hishope
of
obtaining
you
,
or
rather
your
fortune
,
he
laid
siege
to
LadySpinke
,
and
has
eloped
with
her
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
""A
<EOS>
proper
consummation
to
his
folly
,
"
observed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"But
<EOS>
the
best
is
to
come
,
"
pursued
Trussell
.
"
<EOS>
Sir
Singleton
's
marriage
,
as
you
know
,
took
place
at
the
Fleet
,
and
not
having
the
fear
of
courtsof
law
before
his
eyes
,
nor
thinking
it
necessary
to
get
a
divorce
,
theold
beau
is
actually
going
to
marry
again
.
<EOS>
And
this
time
his
choice
hasfallen
upon
--
whom
do
you
think?--Lady
<EOS>
Brabazon!""I'm
glad
that
odious
woman
's
got
rid
of
,
in
any
way
,
"
said
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
"I
never
could
endure
her
.
<EOS>
""By
<EOS>
-
the
-
bye
,
Mr.
Jukes
,
"
said
Trussell
,
laughing
to
himself
at
hissister
's
vivacity
;
"
I
never
heard
what
become
of
your
nephew
,
Mr
.
<EOS>
Cripps?""I'm
happy
to
say
he
's
a
reformed
character
<EOS>
,
sir
,
"
replied
the
butler
.
<EOS>
"He
was
mixed
up
in
some
way
or
other
,
I
do
n't
know
how,--with
<EOS>
thatJacobite
disturbance
,
where
Mr.
Cordwell
Firebras
met
his
death
,
andreceived
a
very
awkward
wound
,
which
put
him
in
danger
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
Since
then
,
he
has
become
quite
an
altered
person
,
and
neither
drinks
,
games
,
nor
dresses
,
as
he
used
to
do
.
<EOS>
He
's
at
present
living
with
a
veryquiet
family
in
Abingdon
street
;
and
,
as
far
as
I
can
learn
,
is
doinghis
duty

<EOS>
""I'm
<EOS>
glad
to
hear
it

"
said
Abel
;
"
and
since
that
is
the
case
,
I
'll
takecare
you
sha'n't
lose
the
twenty
guineas
you
were
foolish
enough
to
lendhim
.
"
<EOS>
Mr.
Jukes
made
a
suitable
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
The
breakfast
things
were
taken
away
,
but
the
party
were
still
chattingover
the
table
,
when
the
door
suddenly
opened
,
and
Randulph
rushed
intothe
room
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
his
travelling
attire
,
and
though
somewhatembrowned
,
looked
handsomer
,
Hilda
thought
,
than
she
had
ever
seenhim
--
except
on
the
occasion
of
his
first
visit
to
her
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
Hewas
followed
by
Jacob
Post
,
who
had
attended
him
in
his
journey
,
and
whoshook
hands
heartily
with
Mr.
Jukes
.
<EOS>
Hilda
who
had
risen
at
Randolph
's
approach
,
was
instantly
locked
in
hisembrace
.
<EOS>
The
tears
started
to
Abel
's
eyes
as
he
regarded
the
meeting
ofthe
young
couple
;
Mrs.
Crew
gazed
at
them
with
fond
delight
;
butTrussell
,
who
was
not
quite
so
much
interested
in
lovers
'
meetings
,
availed
himself
of
the
opportunity
of
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
"Well
,
you
're
looking
vastly
well
,
Randulph
,
I
must
say
,
"
observedTrussell
,
after
his
nephew
's
affectionate
greetings
had
gone
all
round
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
do
n't
think
the
country
has
disagreed
with
you
.
<EOS>
""It
is
the
quiet
life
he
has
led
there
,
brother
,
and
the
early
hoursthat
he
has
kept
,
that
have
agreed
with
him
,
"
observed
Abel
.
<EOS>
"You
are
right
,
uncle
,
"
replied
Randulph
,
"
and
I
am
now
quite
convinced
,
from
the
experiment
I
have
just
made
,
that
a
quiet
life
is
more
to
mytaste
than
a
gay
one
.
<EOS>
""I
am
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
!
"
cried
Abel
.
<EOS>
Trussell
made
no
remark
,
but
he
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
andtook
an
inordinate
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
"You
<EOS>
do
n't
believe
me
,
I
see
,
uncle
,
"
said
Randulph
,
laughing
.
"
<EOS>
But
Iassure
you
it
is
the
case
.
<EOS>
And
I
have
no
doubt
I
shall
bring
you
to
myopinion
when
I
get
you
down
to
Cheshire
.
<EOS>
""When
<EOS>
you
do
get
me
there
,
<EOS>
I
've
no
doubt
you
will
,
"
replied
Trussell
,
somewhat
drily
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Town
agrees
with
me
perfectly
.
<EOS>
Every
one
to
his
taste
.
<EOS>
""And
<EOS>
your
tenants
were
glad
to
see
you
,
Randulph
,
I
am
sure
,
"
said
hismother
,
taking
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"They
were
indeed
,
"
replied
Randulph
;
"
and
I
never
experienced
greatergratification
than
when
they
were
collected
in
the
old
hall
,
and
<EOS>
I
toldthem
<EOS>
I
was
once
more
their
landlord
.
<EOS>
Their
shouts
made
the
rafters
ringagain
.
<EOS>
They
all
wish
to
see
their
mistress
that
is
to
be
,
"
he
continued
,
gazing
tenderly
at
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
I
see
not
why
their
satisfaction
should
be
delayed
,
"
replied
Abel
.
<EOS>
"The
<EOS>
considerations
of
decorum
that
apply
to
others
do
not
apply
toHilda
.
<EOS>
So
much
of
her
life
has
passed
in
self
-
sacrifice
and
trouble
,
that
the
sooner
she
is
recompensed
for
it
the
better
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
best
thing
we
can
do
is
to
leave
the
young
people
together
to
fixthe
day
,
"
said
Trussell
.
<EOS>
"
Make
it
as
early
as
you
can
,
Randulph
;
andnotwithstanding
the
objections
I
raised
to
the
country
just
now
,
I
shallbe
happy
to
spend
a
month
or
two
with
you
at
Crew
Hall
,
whenever
youchoose
to
invite
me
.
<EOS>
""The
<EOS>
house
will
always
be
your
home
,
my
dear
uncle
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"
Noone
will
be
more
welcome
.
<EOS>
"Acting
<EOS>
upon
Trussell
's
hint
,
the
others
then
withdrew
.
<EOS>
Though
Randulphhad
a
thousand
things
to
say
to
Hilda
,
he
could
recollect
none
of
them;but
<EOS>
perhaps
the
expressions
of
rapturous
devotion
he
was
able
to
utter
,
were
fully
as
agreeable
to
his
listener
's
ear
as
any
other
course
hemight
have
adopted
.
<EOS>
Thus
more
than
half
an
hour
passed
away
so
swiftly
,
so
delightfully
,
that
the
lovers
did
not
know
they
had
been
alone
many
minutes
,
when
theywere
interrupted
by
a
discreet
tap
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
"Come
<EOS>
in
,
"
said
Randulph
.
<EOS>
"Beg
<EOS>
pardon
<EOS>
,
"
said
Mr.
Jukes
,
cautiously
obeying
the
summons
;
"
but
MissThomasine
Deacle
is
without
,
and
wishes
to
speak
to
Miss
Scarve
.
<EOS>
""With
me
?
<EOS>
"
exclaimed
Hilda
,
in
surprise
.
<EOS>
"I
told
her
you
were
engaged
with
Mr.
Randulph
--
particularly
engaged,"replied
the
butler
;
"
but
she
said
she
did
n't
mind
that
.
<EOS>
She
wants
to
seeyou
on
a
matter
material
to
her
happiness
.
<EOS>
""She
<EOS>
is
a
strange
creature
,
"
said
Hilda
,
smiling
at
the
recollection
<EOS>
ofher
former
interview
with
her
.
<EOS>
"
I
dare
say
she
wants
to
tell
mesomething
about
Peter
Pokerich
.
<EOS>
""Very
likely
,
"
said
the
butler
,
"
for
he
is
with
her
.
<EOS>
""Well
,
let
them
come
in
,
"
replied
Hilda
.
<EOS>
And
the
next
moment
,
the
fair
Thomasine
and
the
little
barber
wereushered
into
the
room
.
<EOS>
"I
trust
you
will
excuse
this
intrusion
,
Miss
Scarve
,
"
said
the
fairThomasine
,
who
was
a
little
disposed
to
be
in
heroics--"but
<EOS>
I
have
afavor
to
beg
of
you
.
<EOS>
You
are
aware
of
the
admiration
I
have
alwaysentertained
for
you
--
of
the
devotion
I
have
felt
towards
you--""I
am
quite
sensible
of
both
,
"
interrupted
Hilda
,
<EOS>
smiling--"but
thefavor?""After
all
<EOS>
,
my
heart
fails
me
--
I
can
not
ask
it
,
"
said
the
fairThomasine
,
turning
away
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
"I'll
tell
you
what
it
is
,
"
interposed
Peter
;
"
she
declares
she
'll
neverhave
me
,
unless
we
're
married
on
the
same
day
as
you
and
Mr.
Randulph
.
<EOS>
""On
the
same
day
,
and
at
the
same
church
,
"
said
the
fair
Thomasine
,
exhibiting
a
face
like
a
blush
rose
.
<EOS>
"
The
favor
I
wished
to
ask
you
wasyour
consent
to
this
arrangement
.
<EOS>
Peter
met
Mr.
Randulph
and
Jacobcrossing
Westminster
Bridge
on
their
return
from
Cheshire
this
morning
,
and
we
thought
we
had
better
lose
no
time
in
making
the
request
.
<EOS>
""My
consent
was
scarcely
required
,
"
said
Hilda
;
"
but
as
soon
as
the
dayis
fixed
,
you
shall
know
it
.
<EOS>
""I
hope
it
will
be
soon
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
;
"
I
'm
tired
of
being
put
off
sooften
.
<EOS>
""It
would
ill
become
me
to
exhibit
any
impatience
,
"
said
the
fairThomasine
,
casting
down
her
eyes
.
<EOS>
"I
sympathise
with
their
situation
,
Hilda
,
"
said
Randulph
,
taking
herhand
.
<EOS>
"
Can
we
not
give
them
an
answer
now
?
<EOS>
To

<EOS>
Let
it
beMonday
next

<EOS>
""Oh
,
yes

Monday

by
all
means

<EOS>
"
cried
Peter
,
jumping
into
the
air
,
andclapping
his
hands
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
dare
not
urge
Miss
Scarve
to
greater
expedition
,
"
said
the
fairThomasine
,
still
looking
down
;
"
<EOS>
but--""Your
answer
,
"
cried
Peter
,
throwing
himself
on
his
knees
before
Hilda
.
<EOS>
"Yes
,
your
answer
!
<EOS>
"
cried
the
fair
Thomasine
,
kneeling
down
besidePeter
.
<EOS>
"You
can
not
resist
these
entreaties
,
Hilda
?
"
said
Randulph
,
smiling
.
<EOS>
"I
<EOS>
can
not
,
indeed
,
"
she
replied
.
<EOS>
"
Be
it
as
you
propose
.
<EOS>
""Our
marriage
will
take
place
on
Monday

"
said
Randulph
,
"
and
we
shallbe
united
at
the

<EOS>
""How
charming
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Peter
,
rising
,
and
assisting
the
fair
Thomasine
toher
feet
.
<EOS>
"
We
can
go
there
in
a
boat

wont
that
be
delightful?"I
shall
never
forget
this
obligation

Miss

said
the

,
taking
Hilda

hand
,
and
pressing
it
to
her
lips
;
"

Wedeserve

<EOS>
"And
<EOS>
dropping
a
low
courtesy
to
Randulph
,
she
took
her
departure
withPeter

who
skipped
out

scarcely

CHAPTER
XVIII.--DETAILING
<EOS>
AN
EVENT
WHICH
MAY
POSSIBLY
HAVE
BEEN
ANTICIPATED
FROM
THEPRECEDING
CHAPTER.Hurrying
over
the
intervening
period
as
rapidly
as
the
lovers
themselveswould
have
desired
to
hurry
it
over
,
we
shall
proceed
at
once
to
thewished
-
for
day
.
<EOS>
A
little
before
nine
o'clock
on
this
eventful
morning
,
Randulph
,
who
hadtaken
up
his
quarters
with
Sir
Bulkeley
Price
in
Saint
James
's
Square
,
entered
the
breakfast
room
arrayed
in
his
bridal
attire
,
which
had
beenprepared
for
him
by
the
skilful
hands
of
Desmartins
.
<EOS>
He
found
SirBulkeley
Price
and
Sir
Norfolk
Salusbury
at
the
table
--
the
latter
havingcome
up
from
Wales
,
whither
he
had
retired
to
recruit
himself
after
hiswound
,
expressly
to
attend
the
ceremony
.
<EOS>
After
receiving
theircongratulations
,
Randulph
sat
down
with
them
,
but
as
he
could
onlyswallow
a
cup
of
chocolate
,
he
underwent
much
rallying
on
his
want
ofappetite
.
<EOS>
Breakfast
over
,
the
party
drove
to
Whitehall
Stairs
,
where
a
six
-
oaredbarge
was
in
readiness
to
convey
them
across
the
river
.
<EOS>
Jacob
Post
wasappointed
coxswain
of
this
barge
,
and
he
wore
a
waterman
's
coat
ofscarlet
cloth
,
and
a
velvet
jockey
-
shaped
cap
of
the
same
colour
.
<EOS>
Thesix
rowers
were
attired
in
the
same
livery
,
and
presented
a
very
gayappearance
.
<EOS>
The
morning
was
bright
and
beautiful
,
and
everything
seemed
to
Randulphto
participate
in
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
Each
boat
that
passed
them
,
seeing
thepurpose
on
which
they
were
bent
,
cheered
them
cordially
,
and
Jacob
,
whowas
greatly
elated
,
returned
their
greetings
lustily
.
<EOS>
As
they
passed
through
Westminster
Bridge
,
and
shaped
their
rapid
courseto
Lambeth
,
they
passed
a
boat
containing
a
couple
in
bridal
attire
,
androwed
by
watermen
with
favours
in
their
caps
.
<EOS>
These
were
Mr.
Rathboneand
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
who
,
having
made
a
composition
with
theircreditors
,
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
they
could
dowould
be
to
fulfil
their
original
agreement
;
and
having
heard
thatRandulph
and
Hilda
were
to
be
united
at
Lambeth
,
they
determined
,
likePeter
Pokerich
and
the
fair
Thomasine
,
to
be
married
at
the
same
time
,
and
at
the
same
church
.
<EOS>
The
boats
cheered
each
other
as
they
passed
.
<EOS>
Shortly
after
this
,
they
came
up
with
a
four
-
oared
cutter
,
in
which
wasa
still
more
gaily
dressed
bridal
party
,
consisting
of
Mr.
and
Mrs
.
Deacle
,
the
fair
Thomasine
and
Peter
Pokerich
.
<EOS>
The
sunny
tresses
,
brighteyes
,
and
dimpling
cheeks
of
the
bride
,
attracted
Sir
Bulkeley'sadmiration
;
and
he
called
out
to
Peter
that
he
ought
to
consider
himselfa
very
happy
man,--to
which
the
little
barber
replied
"
that
he
was
thehappiest
man
in
the
world,--Mr
.
<EOS>
Crew
excepted
.
<EOS>
"Another
<EOS>
cheering
passed
between
the
rowers
,
and
Randulph
's
barge
sweptover
the
sparkling
waters
to
the
stairs
near
Lambeth
Palace
,
where
heand
his
companions
disembarked
.
<EOS>
As
Abel
Beechcroft
was
extremely
well
known
,
and
highly
respected
in
theneighbourhood
,
great
preparations
were
made
to
lend
eclat
to
hisnephew
's
wedding
.
<EOS>
A
band
of
music
was
stationed
on
a
lighter
moored
nearthe
stairs
;
and
the
lighter
itself
was
hung
all
over
with
flags
andstreamers
.
<EOS>
The
band
was
playing
,
the
bells
ringing
,
and
as
Randulphleapt
ashore
,
a
loud
shout
from
the
crowd
collected
to
see
him
land
,
welcomed
him
,
while
many
flattering
comments
,
in
no
very
low
key
,
weremade
upon
his
handsome
appearance
by
the
female
part
of
the
assemblage
.
<EOS>
In
passing
towards
his
uncle
's
residence
,
Randulph
noticed
with
interesta
troop
of
pretty
little
girls
with
wreaths
round
their
heads
,
andbaskets
of
flowers
in
their
hands
,
standing
in
the
path
leading
to
thechurch
.
<EOS>
The
party
were
admitted
by
Mr.
Jukes
,
whose
portly
figure
was
welldisplayed
in
an
expansive
waistcoat
,
a
brown
coat
,
spick
and
span
newfor
the
occasion
,
and
a
well
-
powdered
bob
-
wig.--The
worthy
butler
gaveRandulph
a
hearty
welcome
,
and
wished
him
many
years
of
happiness
,
andhaving
ushered
him
and
the
others
into
the
parlour
,
returned
to
the
hallto
Jacob
,
to
give
him
wedding
favours
for
himself
and
the
watermen
,
which
the
other
hastened
to
distribute
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
between
the
young
bride
and
bridegroom
was
full
of
agitateddelight
.
<EOS>
Abel
looked
perfectly
happy
,
but
thoughtful
,
as
did
Mrs.
Crew
,
whose
emotion
found
relief
in
an
occasional
sigh
--
not
the
sigh
ofmisgiving
,
but
the
relief
of
a
joy
-
oppressed
heart
.
<EOS>
Trussell
was
,
asusual
,
in
very
high
spirits
.
<EOS>
He
shook
Randulph
heartily
by
the
hand
,
wished
him
all
sorts
of
happiness
,
and
then
cordially
greeted
the
Welshbaronets
.
<EOS>
Besides
Mrs.
Clinton
,
there
was
another
young
lady
present
,
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
of
Mrs.
Crew
's
,
a
Miss
Wilbraham
who
actedas
bridesmaid
to
Hilda
.
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
all
being
declared
in
readiness
,
the
bride
prepared
toset
forth
under
the
care
of
Abel
Beechcroft
,
who
,
before
they
quittedthe
house
,
in
an
earnest
tone
,
invoked
a
blessing
on
her
head
,
and
onthat
of
his
<EOS>
nephew;--and
both
felt
that
the
blessing
of
so
good
a
manwould
not
be
thrown
away
.
<EOS>
Cheered
by
the
good
wishes
and
smiling
countenances
of
the
groupsthrough
which
they
passed
,
and
enlivened
by
the
sunshine
,
the
partyentered
the
church
.
<EOS>
Peter
Pokerich
and
the
fair
Thomasine
,
with
Mr
.
<EOS>
Rathbone
and
Mrs.
Nettleship
,
were
already
standing
beside
the
altar
.
<EOS>
The
young
couple
advanced
,
and
took
the
central
place
,
and
the
churchwas
instantly
crowded
with
spectators
.
<EOS>
The
service
was
admirably
performed
by
a
venerable
clergyman
--
an
old
andvalued
friend
of
Abel
's
;
and
at
its
close
the
concourse
issued
from
thechurch
,
dividing
into
two
lines
,
so
as
to
allow
a
passage
for
thewedding
train
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
happy
couple
were
seen
issuing
hand
inhand
from
the
Gothic
portal
of
the
old
church
,
a
loud
and
joyous
shoutwas
raised
by
the
assemblage
,
a
couple
of
guns
were
fired
on
board
thelighter
,
and
the
church
bells
rang
forth
a
joyous
peal
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
heart
-
cheering
sight
;
and
many
a
breast
throbbed,--and
<EOS>
many
aneye
grew
moist
at
beholding
it
.
<EOS>
And
plenty
of
spectators
there
were
.
<EOS>
Thewhole
of
the
area
before
the
church
was
filled
,
and
the
windows
andtowers
of
the
old

palace
were
studded
with
faces

Thelittle
flower

girls
now
stepped
forward
,
and
strewed
their
fragrantofferings
in
the
path
of
the
happy
pair
,
who
walked
on
amid
thecontinued
cheers
of
the
bystanders
.
<EOS>
A
little
behind
Randulph
,
on
the
right
,
walked
Trussell
,
who
,
excited
bythe
general
enthusiasm
,
had
placed
his
hat
on
his
cane
,
and
waved
it
tothe
crowd
.
<EOS>
Near
him
came
Abel
and
Miss
Wilbraham
,
the
former
with
aglowing
smile
on
his
countenance
,
such
as
Mr.
Jukes
himself
neverremembered
to
have
witnessed
.
<EOS>
After
them
walked
Sir
Norfolk
Salusburyand
Mrs.
Crew
.
<EOS>
Next
in

came
Mr.

Mrs.
Pokerich
,
the
latter
of
whom
thought
itdecorous
to
turn
aside
her
pretty
face
from
the
ardent
gaze
of
herenamoured
little
lord
.
<EOS>
Lastly
came
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rathbone
,
whoseappearance
did
not
seem
greatly
to
interest
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
Sir
BulkeleyPrice
had
posted
himself
on
the
left
of
the
church
door
,
to
watch
thewedding
train
pass
by
,
and
to
wait
the
coming
forth
of
the
clergyman
.
<EOS>
As
Randulph
advanced
through
the
crowd
,
Jacob
Post
stepped
forward
,
andholding
out
his
rough
,
honest
hand
to
him
,
said
in
a
voice
the
sincerityof
which
could
not
be
doubted:--"God
<EOS>
bless
you
,
sir
,
and
your
lovely
bride
,
and
may
you
know
years
ofuninterrupted
happiness!""And
<EOS>
take
my
blessing
too
,
"
said
Mr.

,
likewise
extending
his
hand
.
<EOS>
"An
<EOS>

's
good
wishes
,
though
he
be
but
a
dependent
,
can
do
noharm
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
thank
you
both
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Randulph
,
in
a
voice
of
emotion
;
"
and
my
wifethanks

too
.
<EOS>
""I
<EOS>
do,--I
do
,
"
she
replied
;
"
nor
do
I
doubt
the
fulfilment
of
yourwishes
.
<EOS>
"And
as
she
uttered
these
words
,
loud
and
deafening
cheers
rent
the
air
,
and
another
discharge
of
guns
took
place
.
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
they
proceeded
to
the
house
,
where
they
were
followed
bythe
rest
of
the
party
,
and
presently
afterwards
by
the
clergyman
and
SirBulkeley
.
<EOS>
They
all
then
sat
down
to
an
excellent
repast
.
<EOS>
By
desire
of
his
hospitable
master
,
Mr.
Jukes
invited
the
other
couplesand
their
friends
to
take
refreshments
at
his
house
,
which
,
as
theydelightedly
availed
themselves
of
the
offer
,
were
served
to
them
in
thesummer
-
house
overlooking
the
river
;
where
,
while
enjoying
themselves
,
they
did
not
forget
to
drink
long
life
and
happiness
to
Randulph
and
hisbride
.
<EOS>
The
honeymoon
--
all
the
rest
of
their
lives
was
a
honeymoon
--
was
passedby
the
happy
couple
in
good
old
-
fashioned
style
,
at
Lambeth
.
<EOS>
They
thenproceeded
to
Cheshire
,
accompanied
by
Trussell
and
Mrs.
Crew
,
and
weresoon
afterwards
followed
by
Abel
,
who
passed
the
winter
with
them
.
<EOS>
In
due
time
the
prognostications
of
Mr.
Jukes
were
fulfilled
,
and
Abeldisplayed
no
objection
to
the
endearments
to
two
great
-
nieces
and
agreat
-
nephew
.
<EOS>
Appointed
Randulph
's
head

,
Jacob
Post
passed
the
remainder
ofhis
days
in
the
service
of
his
new
master
.
<EOS>
Of
the
two
brothers
Beechcroft
,
Abel
was
the
first
to
pay
the
debt
ofnature
,
Trussell
surviving
him
two
or
three
years
,
during
which
he
was
agreat
martyr
to
the
gout
.
<EOS>
He
never
,
however
,
lost
his
temper
,
exceptwhen
young
Master
Randulph
accidentally
trod
on
his
toe
;
and
then
hewould
swear
a
round
oath
,
to
frighten
him
,
and
try
to
hit
at
him
withhis
stick
,
as
testy
old
gentlemen
are
wo
nt
to
do
in
plays
.
<EOS>
Randulph
and
Hilda
almost
touched
the
verge
of
the
present
century
;
andfrom
the
anecdotes
of
one
of
their
descendants
,
in
the
third
generation
,
the
materials
of
the
present
Tale
have
been
collected
