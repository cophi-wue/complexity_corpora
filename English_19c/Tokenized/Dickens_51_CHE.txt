IF
you
look
at
a
Map
of
the
World
,
you
will
see
,
in
the
left
-
hand
upper
corner
of
the
Eastern
Hemisphere
,
two
Islands
lying
in
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
They
are
England
and
Scotland
,
and
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
England
and
Scotland
form
the
greater
part
of
these
Islands
.
 
<EOS>
Ireland
is
the
next
in
size
.
 
<EOS>
The
little
neighbouring
islands
,
which
are
so
small
upon
the
Map
as
to
be
mere
dots
,
are
chiefly
little
bits
of
Scotland
,
---
broken
off
,
I
dare
say
,
in
the
course
of
a
great
length
of
time
,
by
the
power
of
the
restless
water
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
old
days
,
a
long
,
long
while
ago
,
before
Our
Saviour
was
born
on
earth
and
lay
asleep
in
a
manger
,
these
Islands
were
in
the
same
place
,
and
the
stormy
sea
roared
round
them
,
just
as
it
roars
now
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
sea
was
not
alive
,
then
,
with
great
ships
and
brave
sailors
,
sailing
to
and
from
all
parts
of
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
very
lonely
.
 
<EOS>
The
Islands
lay
solitary
,
in
the
great
expanse
of
water
.
<EOS>
The
foaming
waves
dashed
against
their
cliffs
,
and
the
bleak
winds
blew
over
their
forests
;
but
the
winds
and
waves
brought
no
adventurers
to
land
upon
the
Islands
,
and
the
savage
Islanders
knew
nothing
of
the
rest
of
the
world
,
and
the
rest
of
the
world
knew
nothing
of
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
that
the
Phoenicians
,
who
were
an
ancient
people
,
famous
for
carrying
on
trade
,
came
in
ships
to
these
Islands
,
and
found
that
they
produced
tin
and
lead
;
both
very
useful
things
,
as
you
know
,
and
both
produced
to
this
very
hour
upon
the
sea
-
coast
.
<EOS>
The
most
celebrated
tin
mines
in
Cornwall
are
,
still
,
close
to
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
which
I
have
seen
,
is
so
close
to
it
that
it
is
hollowed
out
underneath
the
ocean
;
and
the
miners
say
,
that
in
stormy
weather
,
when
they
are
at
work
down
in
that
deep
place
,
they
can
hear
the
noise
of
the
waves
thundering
above
their
heads
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
Phoenicians
,
coasting
about
the
Islands
,
would
come
,
without
much
difficulty
,
to
where
the
tin
and
lead
were
.
  
<EOS>
The
Phoenicians
traded
with
the
Islanders
for
these
metals
,
and
gave
the
Islanders
some
other
useful
things
in
exchange
.
 
<EOS>
The
Islanders
were
,
at
first
,
poor
savages
,
going
almost
naked
,
or
only
dressed
in
the
rough
skins
of
beasts
,
and
staining
their
bodies
,
as
other
savages
do
,
with
coloured
earths
and
the
juices
of
plants
.
<EOS>
But
the
Phoenicians
,
sailing
over
to
the
opposite
coasts
of
France
and
Belgium
,
and
saying
to
the
people
there
,
"
We
have
been
to
those
white
cliffs
across
the
water
,
which
you
can
see
in
fine
weather
,
and
from
that
country
,
which
is
called
BRITAIN
,
we
bring
this
tin
and
lead
,
"
tempted
some
of
the
French
and
Belgians
to
come
over
also
.
 
<EOS>
These
people
settled
themselves
on
the
south
coast
of
England
,
which
is
now
called
Kent
;
and
,
although
they
were
a
rough
people
too
,
they
taught
the
savage
Britons
some
useful
arts
,
and
improved
that
part
of
the
Islands
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
other
people
came
over
from
Spain
to
Ireland
,
and
settled
there
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
by
little
and
little
,
strangers
became
mixed
with
the
Islanders
,
and
the
savage
Britons
grew
into
a
wild
,
bold
people
;
almost
savage
,
still
,
especially
in
the
interior
of
the
country
away
from
the
sea
where
the
foreign
settlers
seldom
went
;
but
hardy
,
brave
,
and
strong
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
country
was
covered
with
forests
,
and
swamps
.
 
<EOS>
The
greater
part
of
it
was
very
misty
and
cold
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
no
roads
,
no
bridges
,
no
streets
,
no
houses
that
you
would
think
deserving
of
the
name
.
 
<EOS>
A
town
was
nothing
but
a
collection
of
straw
-
covered
huts
,
hidden
in
a
thick
wood
,
with
a
ditch
all
round
,
and
a
low
wall
,
made
of
mud
,
or
the
trunks
of
trees
placed
one
upon
another
.
<EOS>
The
people
planted
little
or
no
corn
,
but
lived
upon
the
flesh
of
their
flocks
and
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
no
coins
,
but
used
metal
rings
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
clever
in
basket
-
work
,
as
savage
people
often
are
;
and
they
could
make
a
coarse
kind
of
cloth
,
and
some
very
bad
earthenware
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
building
fortresses
they
were
much
more
clever
.
  
<EOS>
They
made
boats
of
basket
-
work
,
covered
with
the
skins
of
animals
,
but
seldom
,
if
ever
,
ventured
far
from
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
swords
,
of
copper
mixed
with
tin
;
but
,
these
swords
were
of
an
awkward
shape
,
and
so
soft
that
a
heavy
blow
would
bend
one
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
light
shields
,
short
pointed
daggers
,
and
spears
---
which
they
jerked
back
after
they
had
thrown
them
at
an
enemy
,
by
a
long
strip
of
leather
fastened
to
the
stem
.
 
<EOS>
The
butt
-
end
was
a
rattle
,
to
frighten
an
enemy
's
horse
.
 
<EOS>
The
ancient
Britons
,
being
divided
into
as
many
as
thirty
or
forty
tribes
,
each
commanded
by
its
own
little
king
,
were
constantly
fighting
with
one
another
,
as
savage
people
usually
do
;
and
they
always
fought
with
these
weapons
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
very
fond
of
horses
.
 
<EOS>
The
standard
of
Kent
was
the
picture
of
a
white
horse
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
break
them
in
and
manage
them
wonderfully
well
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
horses
(
of
which
they
had
an
abundance
,
though
they
were
rather
small
)
were
so
well
taught
in
those
days
,
that
they
can
scarcely
be
said
to
have
improved
since
;
though
the
men
are
so
much
wiser
.
 
<EOS>
They
understood
,
and
obeyed
,
every
word
of
command
;
and
would
stand
still
by
themselves
,
in
all
the
din
and
noise
of
battle
,
while
their
masters
went
to
fight
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
The
Britons
could
not
have
succeeded
in
their
most
remarkable
art
,
without
the
aid
of
these
sensible
and
trusty
animals
.
 
<EOS>
The
art
<EOS>
I
mean
,
is
the
construction
and
management
of
war
-
chariots
or
cars
,
for
which
they
have
ever
been
celebrated
in
history
.
 
<EOS>
Each
of
the
best
sort
of
these
chariots
,
not
quite
breast
high
in
front
,
and
open
at
the
back
,
contained
one
man
to
drive
,
and
two
or
three
others
to
fight
---
all
standing
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
horses
who
drew
them
were
so
well
trained
,
that
they
would
tear
,
at
full
gallop
,
over
the
most
stony
ways
,
and
even
through
the
woods
;
dashing
down
their
masters
"
enemies
beneath
their
hoofs
,
and
cutting
them
to
pieces
with
the
blades
of
swords
,
or
scythes
,
which
were
fastened
to
the
wheels
,
and
stretched
out
beyond
the
car
on
each
side
,
for
that
cruel
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
moment
,
while
at
full
speed
,
the
horses
would
stop
,
at
the
driver
's
command
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
within
would
leap
out
,
deal
blows
about
them
with
their
swords
like
hail
,
leap
on
the
horses
,
on
the
pole
,
spring
back
into
the
chariots
anyhow
;
and
,
as
soon
as
they
were
safe
,
the
horses
tore
away
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
Britons
had
a
strange
and
terrible
religion
,
called
the
Religion
of
the
Druids
.
 
<EOS>
It
seems
to
have
been
brought
over
,
in
very
early
times
indeed
,
from
the
opposite
country
of
France
,
anciently
called
Gaul
,
and
to
have
mixed
up
the
worship
of
the
Serpent
,
and
of
the
Sun
and
Moon
,
with
the
worship
of
some
of
the
Heathen
Gods
and
Goddesses
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
its
ceremonies
were
kept
secret
by
the
priests
,
the
Druids
,
who
pretended
to
be
enchanters
,
and
who
carried
magicians
"
wands
,
and
wore
,
each
of
them
,
about
his
neck
,
what
he
told
the
ignorant
people
was
a
Serpent
's
egg
in
a
golden
case
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
certain
that
the
Druidical
ceremonies
included
the
sacrifice
of
human
victims
,
the
torture
of
some
suspected
criminals
,
and
,
on
particular
occasions
,
even
the
burning
alive
,
in
immense
wicker
cages
,
of
a
number
of
men
and
animals
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
Druid
Priests
had
some
kind
of
veneration
for
the
Oak
,
and
for
the
mistletoe
---
the
same
plant
that
we
hang
up
in
houses
at
Christmas
Time
now
---
when
its
white
berries
grew
upon
the
Oak
.
 
<EOS>
They
met
together
in
dark
woods
,
which
they
called
Sacred
Groves
;
and
there
they
instructed
,
in
their
mysterious
arts
,
young
men
who
came
to
them
as
pupils
,
and
who
sometimes
stayed
with
them
as
long
as
twenty
years
.
  
<EOS>
These
Druids
built
great
Temples
and
altars
,
open
to
the
sky
,
fragments
of
some
of
which
are
yet
remaining
.
 
<EOS>
Stonehenge
,
on
Salisbury
Plain
,
in
Wiltshire
,
is
the
most
extraordinary
of
these
.
<EOS>
Three
curious
stones
,
called
Kits
Coty
House
,
on
Bluebell
Hill
,
near
Maidstone
,
in
Kent
,
form
another
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
,
from
examination
of
the
great
blocks
of
which
such
buildings
are
made
,
that
they
could
not
have
been
raised
without
the
aid
of
some
ingenious
machines
,
which
are
common
now
,
but
which
the
ancient
Britons
certainly
did
not
use
in
making
their
own
uncomfortable
houses
.
 
<EOS>
I
should
not
wonder
if
the
Druids
,
and
their
pupils
who
stayed
with
them
twenty
years
,
knowing
more
than
the
rest
of
the
Britons
,
kept
the
people
out
of
sight
while
they
made
these
buildings
,
and
then
pretended
that
they
built
them
by
magic
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
they
had
a
hand
in
the
fortresses
too
;
at
all
events
,
as
they
were
very
powerful
,
and
very
much
believed
in
,
and
as
they
made
and
executed
the
laws
,
and
paid
no
taxes
,
I
do
n't
wonder
that
they
liked
their
trade
.
<EOS>
And
,
as
they
persuaded
the
people
the
more
Druids
there
were
,
the
better
off
the
people
would
be
,
I
do
n't
wonder
that
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
there
are
no
Druids
,
NOW
,
who
go
on
in
that
way
,
and
pretend
to
carry
Enchanters
"
Wands
and
Serpents
"
Eggs
---
<EOS>
and
of
course
there
is
nothing
of
the
kind
,
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
improved
condition
of
the
ancient
Britons
,
fifty
-
five
years
before
the
birth
of
Our
Saviour
,
when
the
Romans
,
under
their
great
General
,
Julius
Caesar
,
were
masters
of
all
the
rest
of
the
known
world
.
 
<EOS>
Julius
Caesar
had
then
just
conquered
Gaul
;
and
hearing
,
in
Gaul
,
a
good
deal
about
the
opposite
Island
with
the
white
cliffs
,
and
about
the
bravery
of
the
Britons
who
inhabited
it
---
some
of
whom
had
been
fetched
over
to
help
the
Gauls
in
the
war
against
him
---
he
resolved
,
as
he
was
so
near
,
to
come
and
conquer
Britain
next
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Julius
Caesar
came
sailing
over
to
this
Island
of
ours
,
with
eighty
vessels
and
twelve
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
came
from
the
French
coast
between
Calais
and
Boulogne
,
"
because
thence
was
the
shortest
passage
into
Britain
;
"
just
for
the
same
reason
as
our
steam
-
boats
now
take
the
same
track
,
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
expected
to
conquer
Britain
easily
:
 
<EOS>
but
it
was
not
such
easy
work
as
he
supposed
---
for
the
bold
Britons
fought
most
bravely
;
and
,
what
with
not
having
his
horse
-
soldiers
with
him
(
for
they
had
been
driven
back
by
a
storm
)
,
and
what
with
having
some
of
his
vessels
dashed
to
pieces
by
a
high
tide
after
they
were
drawn
ashore
,
he
ran
great
risk
of
being
totally
defeated
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
for
once
that
the
bold
Britons
beat
him
,
he
beat
them
twice
;
though
not
so
soundly
but
that
he
was
very
glad
to
accept
their
proposals
of
peace
,
and
go
away
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
spring
of
the
next
year
,
he
came
back
;
this
time
,
with
eight
hundred
vessels
and
thirty
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
British
tribes
chose
,
as
their
general
-
in
-
chief
,
a
Briton
,
whom
the
Romans
in
their
Latin
language
called
CASSIVELLAUNUS
,
but
whose
British
name
is
supposed
to
have
been
CASWALLON
.
 
<EOS>
A
brave
general
he
was
,
and
well
he
and
his
soldiers
fought
the
Roman
army
!
 
<EOS>
So
well
,
that
whenever
in
that
war
the
Roman
soldiers
saw
a
great
cloud
of
dust
,
and
heard
the
rattle
of
the
rapid
British
chariots
,
they
trembled
in
their
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
a
number
of
smaller
battles
,
there
was
a
battle
fought
near
Canterbury
,
in
Kent
;
there
was
a
battle
fought
near
Chertsey
,
in
Surrey
;
there
was
a
battle
fought
near
a
marshy
little
town
in
a
wood
,
the
capital
of
that
part
of
Britain
which
belonged
to
CASSIVELLAUNUS
,
and
which
was
probably
near
what
is
now
Saint
Albans
,
in
Hertfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
brave
CASSIVELLAUNUS
had
the
worst
of
it
,
on
the
whole
;
though
he
and
his
men
always
fought
like
lions
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
other
British
chiefs
were
jealous
of
him
,
and
were
always
quarrelling
with
him
,
and
with
one
another
,
he
gave
up
,
and
proposed
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Julius
Caesar
was
very
glad
to
grant
peace
easily
,
and
to
go
away
again
with
all
his
remaining
ships
and
men
.
<EOS>
He
had
expected
to
find
pearls
in
Britain
,
and
he
may
have
found
a
few
for
anything
I
know
;
but
,
at
all
events
,
he
found
delicious
oysters
,
and
I
am
sure
he
found
tough
Britons
---
of
whom
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
he
made
the
same
complaint
as
Napoleon
Bonaparte
the
great
French
General
did
,
eighteen
hundred
years
afterwards
,
when
he
said
they
were
such
unreasonable
fellows
that
they
never
knew
when
they
were
beaten
.
 
<EOS>
They
never
DID
know
,
I
believe
,
and
never
will
.
  
<EOS>
Nearly
a
hundred
years
passed
on
,
and
all
that
time
,
there
was
peace
in
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
The
Britons
improved
their
towns
and
mode
of
life
:
 
became
more
civilised
,
travelled
,
and
learnt
a
great
deal
from
the
Gauls
and
Romans
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
Roman
Emperor
,
Claudius
,
sent
AULUS
PLAUTIUS
,
a
skilful
general
,
with
a
mighty
force
,
to
subdue
the
Island
,
and
shortly
afterwards
arrived
himself
.
 
<EOS>
They
did
little
;
and
OSTORIUS
SCAPULA
,
another
general
,
came
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
British
Chiefs
of
Tribes
submitted
.
 
<EOS>
Others
resolved
to
fight
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
Of
these
brave
men
,
the
bravest
was
CARACTACUS
,
or
CARADOC
,
who
gave
battle
to
the
Romans
,
with
his
army
,
among
the
mountains
of
North
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
day
,
"
said
he
to
his
soldiers
,
"
decides
the
fate
of
Britain
!
 
<EOS>
Your
liberty
,
or
your
eternal
slavery
,
dates
from
this
hour
.
 
<EOS>
Remember
your
brave
ancestors
,
who
drove
the
great
Caesar
himself
across
the
sea
!
"
 
<EOS>
On
hearing
these
words
,
his
men
,
with
a
great
shout
,
rushed
upon
the
Romans
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
strong
Roman
swords
and
armour
were
too
much
for
the
weaker
British
weapons
in
close
conflict
.
 
<EOS>
The
Britons
lost
the
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
wife
and
daughter
of
the
brave
CARACTACUS
were
taken
prisoners
;
his
brothers
delivered
themselves
up
;
he
himself
was
betrayed
into
the
hands
of
the
Romans
by
his
false
and
base
stepmother
:
 
and
they
carried
him
,
and
all
his
family
,
in
triumph
to
Rome
.
  
<EOS>
But
a
great
man
will
be
great
in
misfortune
,
great
in
prison
,
great
in
chains
.
 
<EOS>
His
noble
air
,
and
dignified
endurance
of
distress
,
so
touched
the
Roman
people
who
thronged
the
streets
to
see
him
,
that
he
and
his
family
were
restored
to
freedom
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
knows
whether
his
great
heart
broke
,
and
he
died
in
Rome
,
or
whether
he
ever
returned
to
his
own
dear
country
.
 
<EOS>
English
oaks
have
grown
up
from
acorns
,
and
withered
away
,
when
they
were
hundreds
of
years
old
---
and
other
oaks
have
sprung
up
in
their
places
,
and
died
too
,
very
aged
---
since
the
rest
of
the
history
of
the
brave
CARACTACUS
was
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
the
Britons
WOULD
NOT
yield
.
 
<EOS>
They
rose
again
and
again
,
and
died
by
thousands
,
sword
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
rose
,
on
every
possible
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
SUETONIUS
,
another
Roman
general
,
came
,
and
stormed
the
Island
of
Anglesey
(
then
called
MONA
)
,
which
was
supposed
to
be
sacred
,
and
he
burnt
the
Druids
in
their
own
wicker
cages
,
by
their
own
fires
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
even
while
he
was
in
Britain
,
with
his
victorious
troops
,
the
BRITONS
rose
.
 
<EOS>
Because
BOADICEA
,
a
British
queen
,
the
widow
of
the
King
of
the
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
people
,
resisted
the
plundering
of
her
property
by
the
Romans
who
were
settled
in
England
,
she
was
scourged
,
by
order
of
CATUS
a
Roman
officer
;
and
her
two
daughters
were
shamefully
insulted
in
her
presence
,
and
her
husband
's
relations
were
made
slaves
.
 
<EOS>
To
avenge
this
injury
,
the
Britons
rose
,
with
all
their
might
and
rage
.
 
<EOS>
They
drove
CATUS
into
Gaul
;
they
laid
the
Roman
possessions
waste
;
they
forced
the
Romans
out
of
London
,
then
a
poor
little
town
,
but
a
trading
place
;
they
hanged
,
burnt
,
crucified
,
and
slew
by
the
sword
,
seventy
thousand
Romans
in
a
few
days
.
 
<EOS>
SUETONIUS
strengthened
his
army
,
and
advanced
to
give
them
battle
.
 
<EOS>
They
strengthened
their
army
,
and
desperately
attacked
his
,
on
the
field
where
it
was
strongly
posted
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
first
charge
of
the
Britons
was
made
,
BOADICEA
,
in
a
war
-
chariot
,
with
her
fair
hair
streaming
in
the
wind
,
and
her
injured
daughters
lying
at
her
feet
,
drove
among
the
troops
,
and
cried
to
them
for
vengeance
on
their
oppressors
,
the
licentious
Romans
.
 
<EOS>
The
Britons
fought
to
the
last
;
but
they
were
vanquished
with
great
slaughter
,
and
the
unhappy
queen
took
poison
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
the
spirit
of
the
Britons
was
not
broken
.
 
<EOS>
When
SUETONIUS
left
the
country
,
they
fell
upon
his
troops
,
and
retook
the
Island
of
Anglesey
.
 
<EOS>
AGRICOLA
came
,
fifteen
or
twenty
years
afterwards
,
and
retook
it
once
more
,
and
devoted
seven
years
to
subduing
the
country
,
especially
that
part
of
it
which
is
now
called
SCOTLAND
;
but
,
its
people
,
the
Caledonians
,
resisted
him
at
every
inch
of
ground
.
 
<EOS>
They
fought
the
bloodiest
battles
with
him
;
they
killed
their
very
wives
and
children
,
to
prevent
his
making
prisoners
of
them
;
they
fell
,
fighting
,
in
such
great
numbers
that
certain
hills
in
Scotland
are
yet
supposed
to
be
vast
heaps
of
stones
piled
up
above
their
graves
.
 
<EOS>
HADRIAN
came
,
thirty
years
afterwards
,
and
still
they
resisted
him
.
 
<EOS>
SEVERUS
came
,
nearly
a
hundred
years
afterwards
,
and
they
worried
his
great
army
like
dogs
,
and
rejoiced
to
see
them
die
,
by
thousands
,
in
the
bogs
and
swamps
.
 
<EOS>
CARACALLA
,
the
son
and
successor
of
SEVERUS
,
did
the
most
to
conquer
them
,
for
a
time
;
but
not
by
force
of
arms
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
how
little
that
would
do
.
 
<EOS>
He
yielded
up
a
quantity
of
land
to
the
Caledonians
,
and
gave
the
Britons
the
same
privileges
as
the
Romans
possessed
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
peace
,
after
this
,
for
seventy
years
.
  
<EOS>
Then
new
enemies
arose
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
the
Saxons
,
a
fierce
,
sea
-
faring
people
from
the
countries
to
the
North
of
the
Rhine
,
the
great
river
of
Germany
on
the
banks
of
which
the
best
grapes
grow
to
make
the
German
wine
.
 
<EOS>
They
began
to
come
,
in
pirate
ships
,
to
the
sea
-
coast
of
Gaul
and
Britain
,
and
to
plunder
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
repulsed
by
CARAUSIUS
,
a
native
either
of
Belgium
or
of
Britain
,
who
was
appointed
by
the
Romans
to
the
command
,
and
under
whom
the
Britons
first
began
to
fight
upon
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
this
time
,
they
renewed
their
ravages
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
years
more
,
and
the
Scots
(
which
was
then
the
name
for
the
people
of
Ireland
)
,
and
the
Picts
,
a
northern
people
,
began
to
make
frequent
plundering
incursions
into
the
South
of
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
attacks
were
repeated
,
at
intervals
,
during
two
hundred
years
,
and
through
a
long
succession
of
Roman
Emperors
and
chiefs
;
during
all
which
length
of
time
,
the
Britons
rose
against
the
Romans
,
over
and
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
in
the
days
of
the
Roman
HONORIUS
,
when
the
Roman
power
all
over
the
world
was
fast
declining
,
and
when
Rome
wanted
all
her
soldiers
at
home
,
the
Romans
abandoned
all
hope
of
conquering
Britain
,
and
went
away
.
<EOS>
And
still
,
at
last
,
as
at
first
,
the
Britons
rose
against
them
,
in
their
old
brave
manner
;
for
,
a
very
little
while
before
,
they
had
turned
away
the
Roman
magistrates
,
and
declared
themselves
an
independent
people
.
  
<EOS>
Five
hundred
years
had
passed
,
since
Julius
Caesar
's
first
invasion
of
the
Island
,
when
the
Romans
departed
from
it
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
that
time
,
although
they
had
been
the
cause
of
terrible
fighting
and
bloodshed
,
they
had
done
much
to
improve
the
condition
of
the
Britons
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
made
great
military
roads
;
they
had
built
forts
;
they
had
taught
them
how
to
dress
,
and
arm
themselves
,
much
better
than
they
had
ever
known
how
to
do
before
;
they
had
refined
the
whole
British
way
of
living
.
 
<EOS>
AGRICOLA
had
built
a
great
wall
of
earth
,
more
than
seventy
miles
long
,
extending
from
Newcastle
to
beyond
Carlisle
,
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
out
the
Picts
and
Scots
;
HADRIAN
had
strengthened
it
;
SEVERUS
,
finding
it
much
in
want
of
repair
,
had
built
it
afresh
of
stone
.
  
<EOS>
Above
all
,
it
was
in
the
Roman
time
,
and
by
means
of
Roman
ships
,
that
the
Christian
Religion
was
first
brought
into
Britain
,
and
its
people
first
taught
the
great
lesson
that
,
to
be
good
in
the
sight
of
GOD
,
they
must
love
their
neighbours
as
themselves
,
and
do
unto
others
as
they
would
be
done
by
.
 
<EOS>
The
Druids
declared
that
it
was
very
wicked
to
believe
in
any
such
thing
,
and
cursed
all
the
people
who
did
believe
it
,
very
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
the
people
found
that
they
were
none
the
better
for
the
blessings
of
the
Druids
,
and
none
the
worse
for
the
curses
of
the
Druids
,
but
,
that
the
sun
shone
and
the
rain
fell
without
consulting
the
Druids
at
all
,
they
just
began
to
think
that
the
Druids
were
mere
men
,
and
that
it
signified
very
little
whether
they
cursed
or
blessed
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
the
pupils
of
the
Druids
fell
off
greatly
in
numbers
,
and
the
Druids
took
to
other
trades
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
I
have
come
to
the
end
of
the
Roman
time
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
little
that
is
known
of
those
five
hundred
years
;
but
some
remains
of
them
are
still
found
.
 
<EOS>
Often
,
when
labourers
are
digging
up
the
ground
,
to
make
foundations
for
houses
or
churches
,
they
light
on
rusty
money
that
once
belonged
to
the
Romans
.
 
<EOS>
Fragments
of
plates
from
which
they
ate
,
of
goblets
from
which
they
drank
,
and
of
pavement
on
which
they
trod
,
are
discovered
among
the
earth
that
is
broken
by
the
plough
,
or
the
dust
that
is
crumbled
by
the
gardener

spade

Wells
that
the
Romans
sunk
,
still
yield
water

roads

the
Romans
made

form
part
of
our
highways

<EOS>
In
some
old
battle
-
fields
,
British
spear

heads
and
Roman
armour
have
been
found
,
mingled
together
in
decay

they
fell
in

thick
pressure

the
fight

Traces
of
Roman
camps
overgrown

grass

and

all

Across

bleak

of
Northumberland

the
wall

SEVERUS

overrun

moss

still
stretches

a
strong

unknown

when
the
Druids

with

could
not

written

Ancient
England

<EOS>
THE
Romans
had
scarcely
gone
away
from
Britain
,
when
the
Britons
began
to
wish
they
had
never
left
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
Romans
being
gone
,
and
the
Britons
being
much
reduced
in
numbers
by
their
long
wars
,
the
Picts
and
Scots
came
pouring
in
,
over
the
broken
and
unguarded
wall
of
SEVERUS
,
in
swarms
.
 
<EOS>
They
plundered
the
richest
towns
,
and
killed
the
people
;
and
came
back
so
often
for
more
booty
and
more
slaughter
,
that
the
unfortunate
Britons
lived
a
life
of
terror
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
the
Picts
and
Scots
were
not
bad
enough
on
land
,
the
Saxons
attacked
the
islanders
by
sea
;
and
,
as
if
something
more
were
still
wanting
to
make
them
miserable
,
they
quarrelled
bitterly
among
themselves
as
to
what
prayers
they
ought
to
say
,
and
how
they
ought
to
say
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
priests
,
being
very
angry
with
one
another
on
these
questions
,
cursed
one
another
in
the
heartiest
manner
;
and
(
uncommonly
like
the
old
Druids
)
cursed
all
the
people
whom
they
could
not
persuade
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
altogether
,
the
Britons
were
very
badly
off
,
you
may
believe
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
in
such
distress
,
in
short
,
that
they
sent
a
letter
to
Rome
entreating
help
---
which
they
called
the
Groans
of
the
Britons
;
and
in
which
they
said
,
"
The
barbarians
chase
us
into
the
sea
,
the
sea
throws
us
back
upon
the
barbarians
,
and
we
have
only
the
hard
choice
left
us
of
perishing
by
the
sword
,
or
perishing
by
the
waves
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Romans
could
not
help
them
,
even
if
they
were
so
inclined
;
for
they
had
enough
to
do
to
defend
themselves
against
their
own
enemies
,
who
were
then
very
fierce
and
strong
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
Britons
,
unable
to
bear
their
hard
condition
any
longer
,
resolved
to
make
peace
with
the
Saxons
,
and
to
invite
the
Saxons
to
come
into
their
country
,
and
help
them
to
keep
out
the
Picts
and
Scots
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
British
Prince
named
VORTIGERN
who
took
this
resolution
,
and
who
made
a
treaty
of
friendship
with
HENGIST
and
HORSA
,
two
Saxon
chiefs
.
 
<EOS>
Both
of
these
names
,
in
the
old
Saxon
language
,
signify
Horse
;
for
the
Saxons
,
like
many
other
nations
in
a
rough
state
,
were
fond
of
giving
men
the
names
of
animals
,
as
Horse
,
Wolf
,
Bear
,
Hound
.
 
<EOS>
The
Indians
of
North
America
,
---
a
very
inferior
people
to
the
Saxons

though
---
do
the
same
to
this
day
.
  
<EOS>
HENGIST
and
HORSA
drove
out
the
Picts
and
Scots
;
and
VORTIGERN
,
being
grateful
to
them
for
that
service
,
made
no
opposition
to
their
settling
themselves
in
that
part
of
England
which
is
called
the
Isle
of
Thanet
,
or
to
their
inviting
over
more
of
their
countrymen
to
join
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
HENGIST
had
a
beautiful
daughter
named
ROWENA
;
and
when
,
at
a
feast
,
she
filled
a
golden
goblet
to
the
brim
with
wine
,
and
gave
it
to
VORTIGERN
,
saying
in
a
sweet
voice
,
"
Dear
King
,
thy
health
!
"
<EOS>
the
King
fell
in
love
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
My
opinion
is
,
that
the
cunning
HENGIST
meant
him
to
do
so
,
in
order
that
the
Saxons
might
have
greater
influence
with
him
;
and
that
the
fair
ROWENA
came
to
that
feast
,
golden
goblet
and
all
,
on
purpose
.
  
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
they
were
married
;
and
,
long
afterwards
,
whenever
the
King
was
angry
with
the
Saxons
,
or
jealous
of
their
encroachments
,
ROWENA
would
put
her
beautiful
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
softly
say
,
"
Dear
King
,
they
are
my
people
!
 
<EOS>
Be
favourable
to
them
,
as
you
loved
that
Saxon
girl
who
gave
you
the
golden
goblet
of
wine
at
the
feast
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
,
really
,
I
do
n't
see
how
the
King
could
help
himself
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
We
must
all
die
!
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
years
,
VORTIGERN
died
---
he
was
dethroned
,
and
put
in
prison
,
first
,
I
am
afraid
;
and
ROWENA
died
;
and
generations
of
Saxons
and
Britons
died
;
and
events
that
happened
during
a
long
,
long
time
,
would
have
been
quite
forgotten
but
for
the
tales
and
songs
of
the
old
Bards
,
who
used
to
go
about
from
feast
to
feast
,
with
their
white
beards
,
recounting
the
deeds
of
their
forefathers
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
histories
of
which
they
sang
and
talked
,
there
was
a
famous
one
,
concerning
the
bravery
and
virtues
of
KING
ARTHUR
,
supposed
to
have
been
a
British
Prince
in
those
old
times
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whether
such
a
person
really
lived
,
or
whether
there
were
several
persons
whose
histories
came
to
be
confused
together
under
that
one
name
,
or
whether
all
about
him
was
invention
,
no
one
knows
.
  
<EOS>
I
will
tell
you
,
shortly
,
what
is
most
interesting
in
the
early
Saxon
times
,
as
they
are
described
in
these
songs
and
stories
of
the
Bards
.
  
<EOS>
In
,
and
long
after
,
the
days
of
VORTIGERN
,
fresh
bodies
of
Saxons
,
under
various
chiefs
,
came
pouring
into
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
One
body
,
conquering
the
Britons
in
the
East
,
and
settling
there
,
called
their
kingdom
Essex
;
another
body
settled
in
the
West
,
and
called
their
kingdom
Wessex
;
the
Northfolk
,
or
Norfolk
people
,
established
themselves
in
one
place
;
the
Southfolk
,
or
Suffolk
people
,
established
themselves
in
another
;
and
gradually
seven
kingdoms
or
states
arose
in
England
,
which
were
called
the
Saxon
Heptarchy
.
<EOS>
The
poor
Britons
,
falling
back
before
these
crowds
of
fighting
men
whom
they
had
innocently
invited
over
as
friends
,
retired
into
Wales
and
the
adjacent
country
;
into
Devonshire
,
and
into
Cornwall
.
<EOS>
Those
parts
of
England
long
remained
unconquered
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
Cornwall
now
---
where
the
sea
-
coast
is
very
gloomy
,
steep
,
and
rugged
---
where
,
in
the
dark
winter
-
time
,
ships
have
often
been
wrecked
close
to
the
land
,
and
every
soul
on
board
has
perished
---
where
the
winds
and
waves
howl
drearily
and
split
the
solid
rocks
into
arches
and
caverns
---
there
are
very
ancient
ruins
,
which
the
people
call
the
ruins
of
KING
ARTHUR
'S
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
Kent
is
the
most
famous
of
the
seven
Saxon
kingdoms
,
because
the
Christian
religion
was
preached
to
the
Saxons
there
(
who
domineered
over
the
Britons
too
much
,
to
care
for
what
THEY
said
about
their
religion
,
or
anything
else
)
by
AUGUSTINE
,
a
monk
from
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
KING
ETHELBERT
,
of
Kent
,
was
soon
converted
;
and
the
moment
he
said
he
was
a
Christian
,
his
courtiers
all
said
THEY
were
Christians
;
after
which
,
ten
thousand
of
his
subjects
said
they
were
Christians
too
.
<EOS>
AUGUSTINE
built
a
little
church
,
close
to
this
King
's
palace
,
on
the
ground
now
occupied
by
the
beautiful
cathedral
of
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
SEBERT
,
the
King
's
nephew
,
built
on
a
muddy
marshy
place
near
London
,
where
there
had
been
a
temple
to
Apollo
,
a
church
dedicated
to
Saint
Peter
,
which
is
now
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
in
London
itself
,
on
the
foundation
of
a
temple
to
Diana
,
he
built
another
little
church
which
has
risen
up
,
since
that
old
time
,
to
be
Saint
Paul
's
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
death
of
ETHELBERT
,
EDWIN
,
King
of
Northumbria
,
who
was
such
a
good
king
that
it
was
said
a
woman
or
child
might
openly
carry
a
purse
of
gold
,
in
his
reign
,
without
fear
,
allowed
his
child
to
be
baptised
,
and
held
a
great
council
to
consider
whether
he
and
his
people
should
all
be
Christians
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
decided
that
they
should
be
.
 
<EOS>
COIFI
,
the
chief
priest
of
the
old
religion
,
made
a
great
speech
on
the
occasion
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
discourse
,
he
told
the
people
that
he
had
found
out
the
old
gods
to
be
impostors
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
quite
satisfied
of
it
,
"
he
said
.
 
<EOS>
"
Look
at
me
!
 
<EOS>
I
have
been
serving
them
all
my
life
,
and
they
have
done
nothing
for
me
;
whereas
,
if
they
had
been
really
powerful
,
they
could
not
have
decently
done
less
,
in
return
for
all
I
have
done
for
them
,
than
make
my
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
have
never
made
my
fortune
,
I
am
quite
convinced
they
are
impostors
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
this
singular
priest
had
finished
speaking
,
he
hastily
armed
himself
with
sword
and
lance
,
mounted
a
war
-
horse
,
rode
at
a
furious
gallop
in
sight
of
all
the
people
to
the
temple
,
and
flung
his
lance
against
it
as
an
insult
.
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
the
Christian
religion
spread
itself
among
the
Saxons
,
and
became
their
faith
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
very
famous
prince
was
EGBERT
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
years
afterwards
,
and
claimed
to
have
a
better
right
to
the
throne
of
Wessex
than
BEORTRIC
,
another
Saxon
prince
who
was
at
the
head
of
that
kingdom
,
and
who
married
EDBURGA
,
the
daughter
of
OFFA
,
king
of
another
of
the
seven
kingdoms
.
 
<EOS>
This
QUEEN
EDBURGA
was
a
handsome
murderess
,
who
poisoned
people
when
they
offended
her
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
she
mixed
a
cup
of
poison
for
a
certain
noble
belonging
to
the
court
;
but
her
husband
drank
of
it
too
,
by
mistake
,
and
died
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
people
revolted
,
in
great
crowds
;
and
running
to
the
palace
,
and
thundering
at
the
gates
,
cried
,
"
Down
with
the
wicked
queen
,
who
poisons
men
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
drove
her
out
of
the
country
,
and
abolished
the
title
she
had
disgraced
.
<EOS>
When
years
had
passed
away
,
some
travellers
came
home
from
Italy
,
and
said
that
in
the
town
of
Pavia
they
had
seen
a
ragged
beggar
-
woman
,
who
had
once
been
handsome
,
but
was
then
shrivelled
,
bent
,
and
yellow
,
wandering
about
the
streets
,
crying
for
bread
;
and
that
this
beggar
-
woman
was
the
poisoning
English
queen
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
,
indeed
,
EDBURGA
;
and
so
she
died
,
without
a
shelter
for
her
wretched
head
.
  
<EOS>
EGBERT
,
not
considering
himself
safe
in
England
,
in
consequence
of
his
having
claimed
the
crown
of
Wessex
<EOS>
(
for
he
thought
his
rival
might
take
him
prisoner
and
put
him
to
death
)
,
sought
refuge
at
the
court
of
CHARLEMAGNE
,
King
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
death
of
BEORTRIC
,
so
unhappily
poisoned
by
mistake
,
EGBERT
came
back
to
Britain
;
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
Wessex
;
conquered
some
of
the
other
monarchs
of
the
seven
kingdoms
;
added
their
territories
to
his
own
;
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
called
the
country
over
which
he
ruled
,
ENGLAND
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
new
enemies
arose
,
who
,
for
a
long
time
,
troubled
England
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
the
Northmen
,
the
people
of
Denmark
and
Norway
,
whom
the
English
called
the
Danes
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
a
warlike
people
,
quite
at
home
upon
the
sea
;
not
Christians
;
very
daring
and
cruel
.
<EOS>
They
came
over
in
ships
,
and
plundered
and
burned
wheresoever
they
landed
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
they
beat
EGBERT
in
battle
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
EGBERT
beat
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
they
cared
no
more
for
being
beaten
than
the
English
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
four
following
short
reigns
,
of
ETHELWULF
,
and
his
sons
,
ETHELBALD
,
ETHELBERT
,
and
ETHELRED
,
they
came
back
,
over
and
over
again
,
burning
and
plundering
,
and
laying
England
waste
.
<EOS>
In
the
last
-
mentioned
reign
,
they
seized
EDMUND
,
King
of
East
England
,
and
bound
him
to
a
tree
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
they
proposed
to
him
that
he
should
change
his
religion
;
but
he
,
being
a
good
Christian
,
steadily
refused
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
they
beat
him
,
made
cowardly
jests
upon
him
,
all
defenceless
as
he
was
,
shot
arrows
at
him
,
and
,
finally
,
struck
off
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
say
whose
head
they
might
have
struck
off
next
,
but
for
the
death
of
KING
ETHELRED
from
a
wound
he
had
received
in
fighting
against
them
,
and
the
succession
to
his
throne
of
the
best
and
wisest
king
that
ever
lived
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
the
Good
Saxon
,
Alfred
    
ALFRED
<EOS>
THE
GREAT
was
a
young
man
,
three
-
and
-
twenty
years
of
age
,
when
he
became
king
.
 
<EOS>
Twice
in
his
childhood
,
he
had
been
taken
to
Rome
,
where
the
Saxon
nobles
were
in
the
habit
of
going
on
journeys
which
they
supposed
to
be
religious
;
and
,
once
,
he
had
stayed
for
some
time
in
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
Learning
,
however
,
was
so
little
cared
for
,
then
,
that
at
twelve
years
old
he
had
not
been
taught
to
read
;
although
,
of
the
sons
of
KING
ETHELWULF
,
he
,
the
youngest
,
was
the
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
---
as
most
men
who
grow
up
to
be
great
and
good
<EOS>
are
generally
found
to
have
had
---
an
excellent
mother
;
and
,
one
day
,
this
lady
,
whose
name
was
OSBURGA
,
happened
,
as
she
was
sitting
among
her
sons
,
to
read
a
book
of
Saxon
poetry
.
 
<EOS>
The
art
of
printing
was
not
known
until
long
and
long
after
that
period
,
and
the
book
,
which
was
written
,
was
what
is
called
"
illuminated
,
"
with
beautiful
bright
letters
,
richly
painted
.
 
<EOS>
The
brothers
admiring
it
very
much
,
their
mother
said
,
"
I
will
give
it
to
that
one
of
you
<EOS>
four
princes
who
first
learns
to
read
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
ALFRED
sought
out
a
tutor
that
very
day
,
applied
himself
to
learn
with
great
diligence
,
and
soon
won
the
book
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
proud
of
it
,
all
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
This
great
king
,
in
the
first
year
of
his
reign
,
fought
nine
battles
with
the
Danes
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
some
treaties
with
them
too
,
by
which
the
false
Danes
swore
they
would
quit
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
They
pretended
to
consider
that
they
had
taken
a
very
solemn
oath
,
in
swearing
this
upon
the
holy
bracelets
that
they
wore
,
and
which
were
always
buried
with
them
when
they
died
;
but
they
cared
little
for
it
,
for
they
thought
nothing
of
breaking
oaths
and
treaties
too
,
as
soon
as
it
suited
their
purpose
,
and
coming
back
again
to
fight
,
plunder
,
and
burn
,
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
One
fatal
winter
,
in
the
fourth
year
of
KING
ALFRED
'S
reign
,
they
spread
themselves
in
great
numbers
over
the
whole
of
England
;
and
so
dispersed
and
routed
the
King
's
soldiers
that
the
King
was
left
alone
,
and
was
obliged
to
disguise
himself
as
a
common
peasant
,
and
to
take
refuge
in
the
cottage
of
one
of
his
cowherds
who
did
not
know
his
face
.
  
<EOS>
Here
,
KING
ALFRED
,
while
the
Danes
sought
him
far
and
near
,
was
left
alone
one
day
,
by
the
cowherd
's
wife
,
to
watch
some
cakes
which
she
put
to
bake
upon
the
hearth
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
being
at
work
upon
his
bow
and
arrows
,
with
which
he
hoped
to
punish
the
false
Danes
when
a
brighter
time
should
come
,
and
thinking
deeply
of
his
poor
unhappy
subjects
whom
the
Danes
chased
through
the
land
,
his
noble
mind
forgot
the
cakes
,
and
they
were
burnt
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
!
"
said
the
cowherd
's
wife
,
who
scolded
him
well
when
she
came
back
,
and
little
thought
she
was
scolding
the
King
,
"
you
will
be
ready
enough
to
eat
them
by
-
and
-
by
,
and
yet
you
can
not
watch
them
,
idle
dog
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
Devonshire
men
made
head
against
a
new
host
of
Danes
who
landed
on
their
coast
;
killed
their
chief
,
and
captured
their
flag
;
on
which
was
represented
the
likeness
of
a
Raven
---
a
very
fit
bird
for
a
thievish
army
like
that
,
I
think
.
 
<EOS>
The
loss
of
their
standard
troubled
the
Danes
greatly
,
for
they
believed
it
to
be
enchanted
---
woven
by
the
three
daughters
of
one
father
in
a
single
afternoon
---
and
they
had
a
story
among
themselves
that
when
they
were
victorious
in
battle
,
the
Raven
stretched
his
wings
and
seemed
to
fly
;
and
that
when
they
were
defeated
,
he
would
droop
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
good
reason
to
droop
,
now
,
if
he
could
have
done
anything
half
so
sensible
;
for
,
KING
ALFRED
joined
the
Devonshire
men
;
made
a
camp
with
them
on
a
piece
of
firm
ground
in
the
midst
of
a
bog
in
Somersetshire
;
and
prepared
for
a
great
attempt
for
vengeance
on
the
Danes
,
and
the
deliverance
of
his
oppressed
people
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
first
,
as
it
was
important
to
know
how
numerous
those
pestilent
Danes
were
,
and
how
they
were
fortified
,
KING
ALFRED
,
being
a
good
musician
,
disguised
himself
as
a
glee
-
man
or
minstrel
,
and
went
,
with
his
harp
,
to
the
Danish
camp
.
 
<EOS>
He
played
and
sang
in
the
very
tent
of
GUTHRUM
the
Danish
leader
,
and
entertained
the
Danes
as
they
caroused
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
but
his
music
,
he
was
watchful
of
their
tents
,
their
arms
,
their
discipline
,
everything
that
he
desired
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
And
right
soon
did
this
great
king
entertain
them
to
a
different
tune
;
for
,
summoning
all
his
true
followers
to
meet
him
at
an
appointed
place
,
where
they
received
him
with
joyful
shouts
and
tears
,
as
the
monarch
whom
many
of
them
had
given
up
for
lost
or
dead
,
he
put
himself
at
their
head
,
marched
on
the
Danish
camp
,
defeated
the
Danes
with
great
slaughter
,
and
besieged
them
for
fourteen
days
to
prevent
their
escape
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
being
as
merciful
as
he
was
good
and
brave
,
he
then
,
instead
of
killing
them
,
proposed
peace
:
 
on
condition
that
they
should
altogether
depart
from
that
Western
part
of
England
,
and
settle
in
the
East
;
and
that
GUTHRUM
should
become
a
Christian
,
in
remembrance
of
the
Divine
religion
which
now
taught
his
conqueror
,
the
noble
ALFRED
,
to
forgive
the
enemy
who
had
so
often
injured
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
GUTHRUM
did
.
 
<EOS>
At
his
baptism
,
KING
ALFRED
was
his
godfather
.
 
<EOS>
And
GUTHRUM
was
an
honourable
chief
who
well
deserved
that
clemency
;
for
,
ever
afterwards
he
was
loyal
and
faithful
to
the
king
.
 
<EOS>
The
Danes
under
him
were
faithful
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
plundered
and
burned
no
more
,
but
worked
like
honest
men
.
 
<EOS>
They
ploughed
,
and
sowed
,
and
reaped
,
and
led
good
honest
English
lives
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
hope
the
children
of
those
Danes
played
,
many
a
time
,
with
Saxon
children
in
the
sunny
fields
;
and
that
Danish
young
men
fell
in
love
with
Saxon
girls
,
and
married
them
;
and
that
English
travellers
,
benighted
at
the
doors
of
Danish
cottages
,
often
went
in
for
shelter
until
morning
;
and
that
Danes
and
Saxons
sat
by
the
red
fire
,
friends
,
talking
of
KING
ALFRED
THE
GREAT
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
Danes
were
not
like
these
under
GUTHRUM
;
for
,
after
some
years
,
more
of
them
came
over
,
in
the
old
plundering
and
burning
way
---
among
them
a
fierce
pirate
of
the
name
of
HASTINGS
,
who
had
the
boldness
to
sail
up
the
Thames
to
Gravesend
,
with
eighty
ships
.
<EOS>
For
three
years
,
there
was
a
war
with
these
Danes
;
and
there
was
a
famine
in
the
country
,
too
,
and
a
plague
,
both
upon
human
creatures
and
beasts
.
 
<EOS>
But
KING
ALFRED
,
whose
mighty
heart
never
failed
him
,
built
large
ships
nevertheless
,
with
which
to
pursue
the
pirates
on
the
sea
;
and
he
encouraged
his
soldiers
,
by
his
brave
example
,
to
fight
valiantly
against
them
on
the
shore
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
drove
them
all
away
;
and
then
there
was
repose
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
As
great
and
good
in
peace
,
as
he
was
great
and
good
in
war
,
KING
ALFRED
never
rested
from
his
labours
to
improve
his
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
loved
to
talk
with
clever
men
,
and
with
travellers
from
foreign
countries
,
and
to
write
down
what
they
told
him
,
for
his
people
to
read
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
studied
Latin
after
learning
to
read
English
,
and
now
another
of
his
labours
was
,
to
translate
Latin
books
into
the
English
-
Saxon
tongue
,
that
his
people
might
be
interested
,
and
improved
by
their
contents
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
just
laws
,
that
they
might
live
more
happily
and
freely
;
he
turned
away
all
partial
judges
,
that
no
wrong
might
be
done
them
;
he
was
so
careful
of
their
property
,
and
punished
robbers
so
severely
,
that
it
was
a
common
thing
to
say
that
under
the
great
KING
ALFRED
,
garlands
of
golden
chains
and
jewels
might
have
hung
across
the
streets
,
and
no
man
would
have
touched
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
founded
schools
;
he
patiently
heard
causes
himself
in
his
Court
of
Justice
;
the
great
desires
of
his
heart
were
,
to
do
right
to
all
his
subjects
,
and
to
leave
England
better
,
wiser
,
happier
in
all
ways
,
than
he
found
it
.
 
<EOS>
His
industry
in
these
efforts
was
quite
astonishing
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
he
divided
into
certain
portions
,
and
in
each
portion
devoted
himself
to
a
certain
pursuit
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
might
divide
his
time
exactly
,
he
had
wax
torches
or
candles
made
,
which
were
all
of
the
same
size
,
were
notched
across
at
regular
distances
,
and
were
always
kept
burning
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
as
the
candles
burnt
down
,
he
divided
the
day
into
notches
,
almost
as
accurately
as
we
now
divide
it
into
hours
upon
the
clock
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
candles
were
first
invented
,
it
was
found
that
the
wind
and
draughts
of
air
,
blowing
into
the
palace
through
the
doors
and
windows
,
and
through
the
chinks
in
the
walls
,
caused
them
to
gutter
and
burn
unequally
.
 
<EOS>
To
prevent
this
,
the
King
had
them
put
into
cases
formed
of
wood
and
white
horn
.
 
<EOS>
And
these
were
the
first
lanthorns
ever
made
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
he
was
afflicted
with
a
terrible
unknown
disease
,
which
caused
him
violent
and
frequent
pain
that
nothing
could
relieve
.
 
<EOS>
He
bore
it
,
as
he
had
borne
all
the
troubles
of
his
life
,
like
a
brave
good
man
,
until
he
was
fifty
-
three
years
old
;
and
then
,
having
reigned
thirty
years
,
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
in
the
year
nine
hundred
and
one
;
but
,
long
ago
as
that
is
,
his
fame
,
and
the
love
and
gratitude
with
which
his
subjects
regarded
him
,
are
freshly
remembered
to
the
present
hour
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
next
reign
,
which
was
the
reign
of
EDWARD
,
surnamed
THE
ELDER
,
who
was
chosen
in
council
to
succeed
,
a
nephew
of
KING
ALFRED
troubled
the
country
by
trying
to
obtain
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
The
Danes
in
the
East
of
England
took
part
with
this
usurper
(
perhaps
because
they
had
honoured
his
uncle
so
much
,
and
honoured
him
for
his
uncle
's
sake
)
,
and
there
was
hard
fighting
;
but
,
the
King
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
sister
,
gained
the
day
,
and
reigned
in
peace
for
four
and
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
gradually
extended
his
power
over
the
whole
of
England
,
and
so
the
Seven
Kingdoms
were
united
into
one
.
  
<EOS>
When
England
thus
became
one
kingdom
,
ruled
over
by
one
Saxon
king
,
the
Saxons
had
been
settled
in
the
country
more
than
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
.
 
<EOS>
Great
changes
had
taken
place
in
its
customs
during
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
Saxons
were
still
greedy
eaters
and
great
drinkers
,
and
their
feasts
were
often
of
a
noisy
and
drunken
kind
;
but
many
new
comforts
and
even
elegances
had
become
known
,
and
were
fast
increasing
.
 
<EOS>
Hangings
for
the
walls
of
rooms
,
where
,
in
these
modern
days
,
we
paste
up
paper
,
are
known
to
have
been
sometimes
made
of
silk
,
ornamented
with
birds
and
flowers
in
needlework
.
<EOS>
Tables
and
chairs
were
curiously
carved
in
different
woods
;
were
sometimes
decorated
with
gold
or
silver
;
sometimes
even
made
of
those
precious
metals
.
 
<EOS>
Knives
and
spoons
were
used
at
table
;
golden
ornaments
were
worn
---
with
silk
and
cloth
,
and
golden
tissues
and
embroideries
;
dishes
were
made
of
gold
and
silver
,
brass
and
bone
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
varieties
of
drinking
-
horns
,
bedsteads
,
musical
instruments
.
 
<EOS>
A
harp
was
passed
round
,
at
a
feast
,
like
the
drinking
-
bowl
,
from
guest
to
guest
;
and
each
one
usually
sang
or
played
when
his
turn
came
.
 
<EOS>
The
weapons
of
the
Saxons
were
stoutly
made
,
and
among
them
was
a
terrible
iron
hammer
that
gave
deadly
blows
,
and
was
long
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
The
Saxons
themselves
were
a
handsome
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
were
proud
of
their
long
fair
hair
,
parted
on
the
forehead
;
their
ample
beards
,
their
fresh
complexions
,
and
clear
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
The
beauty
of
the
Saxon
women
filled
all
England
with
a
new
delight
and
grace
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
more
to
tell
of
the
Saxons
yet
,
but
I
stop
to
say
this
now
,
because
under
the
GREAT
ALFRED
,
all
the
best
points
of
the
English
-
Saxon
character
were
first
encouraged
,
and
in
him
first
shown
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
the
greatest
character
among
the
nations
of
the
earth
.
<EOS>
Wherever
the
descendants
of
the
Saxon
race
have
gone
,
have
sailed
,
or
otherwise
made
their
way
,
even
to
the
remotest
regions
of
the
world
,
they
have
been
patient
,
persevering
,
never
to
be
broken
in
spirit
,
never
to
be
turned
aside
from
enterprises
on
which
they
have
resolved
.
 
<EOS>
In
Europe
,
Asia
,
Africa
,
America
,
the
whole
world
over
;
in
the
desert
,
in
the
forest
,
on
the
sea
;
scorched
by
a
burning
sun
,
or
frozen
by
ice
that
never
melts
;
the
Saxon
blood
remains
unchanged
.
 
<EOS>
Wheresoever
that
race
goes
,
there
,
law
,
and
industry
,
and
safety
for
life
and
property
,
and
all
the
great
results
of
steady
perseverance
,
are
certain
to
arise
.
  
<EOS>
I
pause
to
think
with
admiration
,
of
the
noble
king
who
,
in
his
single
person
,
possessed
all
the
Saxon
virtues
.
 
<EOS>
Whom
misfortune
could
not
subdue
,
whom
prosperity
could
not
spoil
,
whose
perseverance
nothing
could
shake
.
 
<EOS>
Who
was
hopeful
in
defeat
,
and
generous
in
success
.
 
<EOS>
Who
loved
justice
,
freedom
,
truth
,
and
knowledge
.
 
<EOS>
Who
,
in
his
care
to
instruct
his
people
,
probably
did
more
to
preserve
the
beautiful
old
Saxon
language
,
than
I
can
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
Without
whom
,
the
English
tongue
in
which
I
tell
this
story
might
have
wanted
half
its
meaning
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
is
said
that
his
spirit
still
inspires
some
of
our
best
English
laws
,
so
,
let
you
and
I
pray
that
it
may
animate
our
English
hearts
,
at
least
to
this
---
to
resolve
,
when
we
see
any
of
our
fellow
-
creatures
left
in
ignorance
,
that
we
will
do
our
best
,
while
life
is
in
us
,
to
have
them
taught
;
and
to
tell
those
rulers
whose
duty
it
is
to
teach
them
,
and
who
neglect
their
duty
,
that
they
have
profited
very
little
by
all
the
years
that
have
rolled
away
since
the
year
nine
hundred
and
one
,
and
that
they
are
far
behind
the
bright
example
of
KING
ALFRED
THE
GREAT
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Athelstan
and
the
Six
Boy
-
Kings
    
ATHELSTAN
,
the
son
of
Edward
the
Elder
,
succeeded
that
king
.
 
<EOS>
He
reigned
only
fifteen
years
;
but
he
remembered
the
glory
of
his
grandfather
,
the
great
Alfred
,
and
governed
England
well
.
 
<EOS>
He
reduced
the
turbulent
people
of
Wales
,
and
obliged
them
to
pay
him
a
tribute
in
money
,
and
in
cattle
,
and
to
send
him
their
best
hawks
and
hounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
victorious
over
the
Cornish
men
,
who
were
not
yet
quite
under
the
Saxon
government
.
 
<EOS>
He
restored
such
of
the
old
laws
as
were
good
,
and
had
fallen
into
disuse
;
made
some
wise
new
laws
,
and
took
care
of
the
poor
and
weak
.
 
<EOS>
A
strong
alliance
,
made
against
him
by
ANLAF
a
Danish
prince
,
CONSTANTINE
King
of
the
Scots
,
and
the
people
of
North
Wales
,
he
broke
and
defeated
in
one
great
battle
,
long
famous
for
the
vast
numbers
slain
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
After
that
,
he
had
a
quiet
reign
;
the
lords
and
ladies
about
him
had
leisure
to
become
polite
and
agreeable
;
and
foreign
princes
were
glad
(
as
they
have
sometimes
been
since
)
to
come
to
England
on
visits
to
the
English
court
.
  
<EOS>
When
Athelstan
died
,
at
forty
-
seven
years
old
,
his
brother
EDMUND
,
who
was
only
eighteen
,
became
king
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
first
of
six
boy
-
kings
,
as
you
will
presently
know
.
  
<EOS>
They
called
him
the
Magnificent
,
because
he
showed
a
taste
for
improvement
and
refinement
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
beset
by
the
Danes
,
and
had
a
short
and
troubled
reign
,
which
came
to
a
troubled
end
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
when
he
was
feasting
in
his
hall
,
and
had
eaten
much
and
drunk
deep
,
he
saw
,
among
the
company
,
a
noted
robber
named
LEOF
,
who
had
been
banished
from
England
.
 
<EOS>
Made
very
angry
by
the
boldness
of
this
man
,
the
King
turned
to
his
cup
-
bearer
,
and
said
,
"
There
is
a
robber
sitting
at
the
table
yonder
,
who
,
for
his
crimes
,
is
an
outlaw
in
the
land
---
a
hunted
wolf
,
whose
life
any
man
may
take
,
at
any
time
.
 
<EOS>
Command
that
robber
to
depart
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
not
depart
!
"
said
Leof
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
?
"
cried
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
No
,
by
the
Lord
!
"
said
Leof
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
the
King
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
,
making
passionately
at
the
robber
,
and
seizing
him
by
his
long
hair
,
tried
to
throw
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
robber
had
a
dagger
underneath
his
cloak
,
and
,
in
the
scuffle
,
stabbed
the
King
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
set
his
back
against
the
wall
,
and
fought
so
desperately
,
that
although
he
was
soon
cut
to
pieces
by
the
King
's
armed
men
,
and
the
wall
and
pavement
were
splashed
with
his
blood
,
yet
it
was
not
before
he
had
killed
and
wounded
many
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
imagine
what
rough
lives
the
kings
of
those
times
led
,
when
one
of
them
could
struggle
,
half
drunk
,
with
a
public
robber
in
his
own
dining
-
hall
,
and
be
stabbed
in
presence
of
the
company
who
ate
and
drank
with
him
.
  
<EOS>
Then
succeeded
the
boy
-
king
EDRED
,
who
was
weak
and
sickly
in
body
,
but
of
a
strong
mind
.
 
<EOS>
And
his
armies
fought
the
Northmen
,
the
Danes
,
and
Norwegians
,
or
the
Sea
-
Kings
,
as
they
were
called
,
and
beat
them
for
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
in
nine
years
,
Edred
died
,
and
passed
away
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
boy
-
king
EDWY
,
fifteen
years
of
age
;
but
<EOS>
the
real
king
,
who
had
the
real
power
,
was
a
monk
named
DUNSTAN
---
a
clever
priest
,
a
little
mad
,
and
not
a
little
proud
and
cruel
.
  
<EOS>
Dunstan
was
then
Abbot
of
Glastonbury
Abbey
,
whither
the
body
of
King
Edmund
the
Magnificent
was
carried
,
to
be
buried
.
 
<EOS>
While
<EOS>
yet
a
boy
,
he
had
got
out
of
his
bed
one
night
(
being
then
in
a
fever
)
,
and
walked
about
Glastonbury
Church
when
it
was
under
repair
;
and
,
because
he
did
not
tumble
off
some
scaffolds
that
were
there
,
and
break
his
neck
,
it
was
reported
that
he
had
been
shown
over
the
building
by
an
angel
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
also
made
a
harp
that
was
said
to
play
of
itself
---
which
it
very
likely
did
,
as
AEolian
Harps
,
which
are
played
by
the
wind
,
and
are
understood
now
,
always
do
.
 
<EOS>
For
these
wonders
he
had
been
once
denounced
by
his
enemies
,
who
were
jealous
of
his
favour
with
the
late
King
Athelstan
,
as
a
magician
;
and
he
had
been
waylaid
,
bound
hand
and
foot
,
and
thrown
into
a
marsh
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
got
out
again
,
somehow
,
to
cause
a
great
deal
of
trouble
yet
.
  
<EOS>
The
priests
of
those
days
were
,
generally
,
the
only
scholars
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
learned
in
many
things
.
 
<EOS>
Having
to
make
their
own
convents
and
monasteries
on
uncultivated
grounds
that
were
granted
to
them
by
the
Crown
,
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
be
good
farmers
and
good
gardeners
,
or
their
lands
would
have
been
too
poor
to
support
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
the
decoration
of
the
chapels
where
they
prayed
,
and
for
the
comfort
of
the
refectories
where
they
ate
and
drank
,
it
was
necessary
that
there
should
be
good
carpenters
,
good
smiths
,
good
painters
,
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
For
their
greater
safety
in
sickness
and
accident
,
living
alone
by
themselves
in
solitary
places
,
it
was
necessary
that
they
should
study
the
virtues
of
plants
and
herbs
,
and
should
know
how
to
dress
cuts
,
burns
,
scalds
,
and
bruises
,
and
how
to
set
broken
limbs
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
they
taught
themselves
,
and
one
another
,
a
great
variety
of
useful
arts
;
and
became
skilful
in
agriculture
,
medicine
,
surgery
,
and
handicraft
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
they
wanted
the
aid
of
any
little
piece
of
machinery
,
which
would
be
simple
enough
now
,
but
was
marvellous
then
,
to
impose
a
trick
upon
the
poor
peasants
,
they
knew
very
well
how
to
make
it
;
and
DID
make
it
many
a
time
and
often
,
I
have
no
doubt
.
  
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
Abbot
of
Glastonbury
Abbey
,
was
one
of
the
most
sagacious
of
these
monks
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
ingenious
smith
,
and
worked
at
a
forge
in
a
little
cell
.
 
<EOS>
This
cell
was
made
too
short
to
admit
of
his
lying
at
full
length
when
he
went
to
sleep
---
as
if
THAT
did
any
good
to
anybody
!
<EOS>
---
and
he
used
to
tell
the
most
extraordinary
lies
about
demons
and
spirits
,
who
,
he
said
,
came
there
to
persecute
him
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
,
he
related
that
one
day
when
he
was
at
work
,
the
devil
looked
in
at
the
little
window
,
and
tried
to
tempt
him
to
lead
a
life
of
idle
pleasure
;
whereupon
,
having
his
pincers
in
the
fire
,
red
hot
,
he
seized
the
devil
by
the
nose
,
and
put
him
to
such
pain
,
that
his
bellowings
were
heard
for
miles
and
miles
.
 
<EOS>
Some
people
are
inclined
to
think
this
nonsense
a
part
of
Dunstan
's
madness
(
for
his
head
never
quite
recovered
the
fever
)
,
but
I
think
not
.
 
<EOS>
I
observe
that
it
induced
the
ignorant
people
to
consider
him
a
holy
man
,
and
that
it
made
him
very
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
Which
was
exactly
what
he
always
wanted
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
the
coronation
of
the
handsome
boy
-
king
Edwy
,
it
was
remarked
by
ODO
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
(
who
was
a
Dane
by
birth
)
,
that
the
King
quietly
left
the
coronation
feast
,
while
all
the
company
were
there
.
 
<EOS>
Odo
,
much
displeased
,
sent
his
friend
Dunstan
to
seek
him
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
finding
him
in
the
company
of
his
beautiful
young
wife
ELGIVA
,
and
her
mother
ETHELGIVA
,
a
good
and
virtuous
lady
,
not
only
grossly
abused
them
,
but
dragged
the
young
King
back
into
the
feasting
-
hall
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
Some
,
again
,
think
Dunstan
did
this
because
the
young
King
's
fair
wife
was
his
own
cousin
,
and
the
monks
objected
to
people
marrying
their
own
cousins
;
but
I
believe
he
did
it
,
because
he
was
an
imperious
,
audacious
,
ill
-
conditioned
priest
,
who
,
having
loved
a
young
lady
himself
before
he
became
a
sour
monk
,
hated
all
love
now
,
and
everything
belonging
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
King
was
quite
old
enough
to
feel
this
insult
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
had
been
Treasurer
in
the
last
reign
,
and
he
soon
charged
Dunstan
with
having
taken
some
of
the
last
king
's
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
Glastonbury
Abbot
fled
to
Belgium
(
very
narrowly
escaping
some
pursuers
who
were
sent
to
put
out
his
eyes
,
as
you
will
wish
they
had
,
when
you
read
what
follows
)
,
and
his
abbey
was
given
to
priests
who
were
married
;
whom
he
always
,
both
before
and
afterwards
,
opposed
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
quickly
conspired
with
his
friend
,
Odo
the
Dane
,
to
set
up
the
King
's
young
brother
,
EDGAR
,
as
his
rival
for
the
throne
;
and
,
not
content
with
this
revenge
,
he
caused
the
beautiful
queen
Elgiva
,
though
a
lovely
girl
of
only
seventeen
or
eighteen
,
to
be
stolen
from
one
of
the
Royal
Palaces
,
branded
in
the
cheek
with
a
red
-
hot
iron
,
and
sold
into
slavery
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Irish
people
pitied
and
befriended
her
;
and
they
said
,
"
Let
us
restore
the
girl
-
queen
to
the
boy
-
king
,
and
make
the
young
lovers
happy
!
"
<EOS>
and
they
cured
her
of
her
cruel
wound
,
and
sent
her
home
as
beautiful
as
before
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
villain
Dunstan
,
and
that
other
villain
,
Odo
,
caused
her
to
be
waylaid
at
Gloucester
as
she
was
joyfully
hurrying
to
join
her
husband
,
and
to
be
hacked
and
hewn
with
swords
,
and
to
be
barbarously
maimed
and
lamed
,
and
left
to
die
.
 
<EOS>
When
Edwy
the
Fair
(
his
people
called
him
so
,
because
he
was
so
young
and
handsome
)
<EOS>
heard
of
her
dreadful
fate
,
he
died
of
a
broken
heart
;
and
so
the
pitiful
story
of
the
poor
young
wife
and
husband
ends
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
 
<EOS>
Better
to
be
two
cottagers
in
these
better
times
,
than
king
and
queen
of
England
in
those
bad
days
,
though
never
so
fair
!
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
boy
-
king
,
EDGAR
,
called
the
Peaceful
,
fifteen
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
Dunstan
,
being
still
the
real
king
,
drove
all
married
priests
out
of
the
monasteries
and
abbeys
,
and
replaced
them
by
solitary
monks
like
himself
,
of
the
rigid
order
called
the
Benedictines
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
himself
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
for
his
greater
glory
;
and
exercised
such
power
over
the
neighbouring
British
princes
,
and
so
collected
them
about
the
King
,
that
once
,
when
the
King
held
his
court
at
Chester
,
and
went
on
the
river
Dee
to
visit
the
monastery
of
St
John
,
the
eight
oars
of
his
boat
were
pulled
(
as
the
people
used
to
delight
in
relating
in
stories
and
songs
)
by
eight
crowned
kings
,
and
steered
by
the
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
As
Edgar
was
very
obedient
to
Dunstan
and
the
monks
,
they
took
great
pains
to
represent
him
as
the
best
of
kings
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
really
profligate
,
debauched
,
and
vicious
.
 
<EOS>
He
once
forcibly
carried
off
a
young
lady
from
the
convent
at
Wilton
;
and
Dunstan
,
pretending
to
be
very
much
shocked
,
condemned
him
not
to
wear
his
crown
upon
his
head
for
seven
years
---
no
great
punishment
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
as
it
can
hardly
have
been
a
more
comfortable
ornament
to
wear
,
than
a
stewpan
without
a
handle
.
 
<EOS>
His
marriage
with
his
second
wife
,
ELFRIDA
,
is
one
of
the
worst
events
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
of
the
beauty
of
this
lady
,
he
despatched
his
favourite
courtier
,
ATHELWOLD
,
to
her
father
's
castle
in
Devonshire
,
to
see
if
she
were
really
as
charming
as
fame
reported
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
she
was
so
exceedingly
beautiful
that
Athelwold
fell
in
love
with
her
himself
,
and
married
her
;
but
he
told
the
King
that
she
was
only
rich
---
not
handsome
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
suspecting
the
truth
when
they
came
home
,
resolved
to
pay
the
newly
-
married
couple
a
visit
;
and
,
suddenly
,
told
Athelwold
to
prepare
for
his
immediate
coming
.
 
<EOS>
Athelwold
,
terrified
,
confessed
to
his
young
wife
what
he
had
said
and
done
,
and
implored
her
to
disguise
her
beauty
by
some
ugly
dress
or
silly
manner
,
that
he
might
be
safe
from
the
King
's
anger
.
 
<EOS>
She
promised
that
she
would
;
but
she
was
a
proud
woman
,
who
would
far
rather
have
been
a
queen
than
the
wife
of
a
courtier
.
 
<EOS>
She
dressed
herself
in
her
best
dress
,
and
adorned
herself
with
her
richest
jewels
;
and
when
the
King
came
,
presently
,
he
discovered
the
cheat
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
caused
his
false
friend
,
Athelwold
,
to
be
murdered
in
a
wood
,
and
married
his
widow
,
this
bad
Elfrida
.
 
<EOS>
Six
or
seven
years
afterwards
,
he
died
;
and
was
buried
,
as
if
he
had
been
all
that
the
monks
said
he
was
,
in
the
abbey
of
Glastonbury
,
which
he
---
or
Dunstan
for
him
---
had
much
enriched
.
  
<EOS>
England
,
in
one
part
of
this
reign
,
was
so
troubled
by
wolves
,
which
,
driven
out
of
the
open
country
,
hid
themselves
in
the
mountains
of
Wales
when
they
were
not
attacking
travellers
and
animals
,
that
the
tribute
payable
by
the
Welsh
people
was
forgiven
them
,
on
condition
of
their
producing
,
every
year
,
three
hundred
wolves
"
heads
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Welshmen
were
so
sharp
upon
the
wolves
,
to
save
their
money
,
that
in
four
years
there
was
not
a
wolf
left
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
boy
-
king
,
EDWARD
,
called
the
Martyr
,
from
the
manner
of
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
Elfrida
had
a
son
,
named
ETHELRED
,
for
whom
she
claimed
the
throne
;
but
Dunstan
did
not
choose
to
favour
him
,
and
he
made
Edward
king
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
was
hunting
,
one
day
,
down
in
Dorsetshire
,
when
he
rode
near
to
Corfe
Castle
,
where
Elfrida
and
Ethelred
lived
.
 
<EOS>
Wishing
to
see
them
kindly
,
he
rode
away
from
his
attendants
and
galloped
to
the
castle
gate
,
where
he
arrived
at
twilight
,
and
blew
his
hunting
-
horn
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
are
welcome
,
dear
King
,
"
said
Elfrida
,
coming
out
,
with
her
brightest
smiles
.
 
<EOS>
"
Pray
you
dismount
and
enter
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Not
so
,
dear
madam
,
"
said
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
My
company
will
miss
me
,
and
fear
that
I
have
met
with
some
harm
.
<EOS>
Please
you
to
give
me
a
cup
of
wine
,
that
I
may
drink
here
,
in
the
saddle
,
to
you
and
to
my
little
brother
,
and
so
ride
away
with
the
good
speed
I
have
made
in
riding
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Elfrida
,
going
in
to
bring
the
wine
,
whispered
an
armed
servant
,
one
of
her
attendants
,
who
stole
out
of
the
darkening
gateway
,
and
crept
round
behind
the
King
's
horse
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
King
raised
the
cup
to
his
lips
,
saying
,
"
Health
!
"
<EOS>
to
the
wicked
woman
who
was
smiling
on
him
,
and
to
his
innocent
brother
whose
hand
she
held
in
hers
,
and
who
was
only
ten
years
old
,
this
armed
man
made
a
spring
and
stabbed
him
in
the
back
.
 
<EOS>
He
dropped
the
cup
and
spurred
his
horse
away
;
but
,
soon
fainting
with
loss
of
blood
,
dropped
from
the
saddle
,
and
,
in
his
fall
,
entangled
one
of
his
feet
in
the
stirrup
.
 
<EOS>
The
frightened
horse
dashed
on
;
trailing
his
rider
's
curls
upon
the
ground
;
dragging
his
smooth
young
face
through
ruts
,
and
stones
,
and
briers
,
and
fallen
leaves
,
and
mud
;
until
the
hunters
,
tracking
the
animal
's
course
by
the
King
's
blood
,
caught
his
bridle
,
and
released
the
disfigured
body
.
  
<EOS>
Then
came
the
sixth
and
last
of
the
boy
-
kings
,
ETHELRED
,
whom
Elfrida
,
when
he
cried
out
at
the
sight
of
his
murdered
brother
riding
away
from
the
castle
gate
,
unmercifully
beat
with
a
torch
which
she
snatched
from
one
of
the
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
so
disliked
this
boy
,
on
account
of
his
cruel
mother
and
the
murder
she
had
done
to
promote
him
,
that
Dunstan
would
not
have
had
him
for
king
,
but
would
have
made
EDGITHA
,
the
daughter
of
the
dead
King
Edgar
,
and
of
the
lady
whom
he
stole
out
of
the
convent
at
Wilton
,
Queen
of
England
,
if
she
would
have
consented
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
knew
the
stories
of
the
youthful
kings
too
well
,
and
would
not
be
persuaded
from
the
convent
where
she
lived
in
peace
;
so
,
Dunstan
put
Ethelred
on
the
throne
,
having
no
one
else
to
put
there
,
and
gave
him
the
nickname
of
THE
UNREADY
---
knowing
that
he
wanted
resolution
and
firmness
.
  
<EOS>
At
first
,
Elfrida
possessed
great
influence
over
the
young
King
,
but
,
as
he
grew
older
and
came
of
age
,
her
influence
declined
.
 
<EOS>
The
infamous
woman
,
not
having
it
in
her
power
to
do
any
more
evil
,
then
retired
from
court
,
and
,
according
,
to
the
fashion
of
the
time
,
built
churches
and
monasteries
,
to
expiate
her
guilt
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
a
church
,
with
a
steeple
reaching
to
the
very
stars
,
would
have
been
any
sign
of
true
repentance
for
the
blood
of
the
poor
boy
,
whose
murdered
form
was
trailed
at
his
horse
's
heels
!
 
<EOS>
As
if
she
could
have
buried
her
wickedness
beneath
the
senseless
stones
of
the
whole
world
,
piled
up
one
upon
another
,
for
the
monks
to
live
in
!
  
<EOS>
About
the
ninth
or
tenth
year
of
this
reign
,
Dunstan
died
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
growing
old
then
,
but
was
as
stern
and
artful
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
Two
circumstances
that
happened
in
connexion
with
him
,
in
this
reign
of
Ethelred
,
made
a
great
noise
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
he
was
present
at
a
meeting
of
the
Church
,
when
the
question
was
discussed
whether
priests
should
have
permission
to
marry
;
and
,
as
he
sat
with
his
head
hung
down
,
apparently
thinking
about
it
,
a
voice
seemed
to
come
out
of
a
crucifix
in
the
room
,
and
warn
the
meeting
to
be
of
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
This
was
some
juggling
of
Dunstan
's
,
and
was
probably
his
own
voice
disguised
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
played
off
a
worse
juggle
than
that
,
soon
afterwards
;
for
,
another
meeting
being
held
on
the
same
subject
,
and
he
and
his
supporters
being
seated
on
one
side
of
a
great
room
,
and
their
opponents
on
the
other
,
he
rose
and
said
,
"
To
Christ
himself
,
as
judge
,
do
I
commit
this
cause
!
"
 
<EOS>
Immediately
on
these
words
being
spoken
,
the
floor
where
the
opposite
party
sat
gave
way
,
and
some
were
killed
and
many
wounded
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
be
pretty
sure
that
it
had
been
weakened
under
Dunstan
's
direction
,
and
that
it
fell
at
Dunstan
's
signal
.
 
<EOS>
HIS
part
of
the
floor
did
not
go
down
.
<EOS>
No
,
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
too
good
a
workman
for
that
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
died
,
the
monks
settled
that
he
was
a
Saint
,
and
called
him
Saint
Dunstan
ever
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
They
might
just
as
well
have
settled
that
he
was
a
coach
-
horse
,
and
could
just
as
easily
have
called
him
one
.
  
<EOS>
Ethelred
the
Unready
was
glad
enough
,
I
dare
say
,
to
be
rid
of
this
holy
saint
;
but
,
left
to
himself
,
he
was
a
poor
weak
king
,
and
his
reign
was
a
reign
of
defeat
and
shame
.
 
<EOS>
The
restless
Danes
,
led
by
SWEYN
,
a
son
of
the
King
of
Denmark
who
had
quarrelled
with
his
father
and
had
been
banished
from
home
,
again
came
into
England
,
and
,
year
after
year
,
attacked
and
despoiled
large
towns
.
 
<EOS>
To
coax
these
sea
-
kings
away
,
the
weak
Ethelred
paid
them
money
;
but
,
the
more
money
he
paid
,
the
more
money
the
Danes
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
gave
them
ten
thousand
pounds
;
on
their
next
invasion
,
sixteen
thousand
pounds
;
on
their
next
invasion
,
four
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
:
 
to
pay
which
large
sums
,
the
unfortunate
English
people
were
heavily
taxed
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
Danes
still
came
back
and
wanted
more
,
he
thought
it
would
be
a
good
plan
to
marry
into
some
powerful
foreign
family
that
would
help
him
with
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
and
two
,
he
courted
and
married
Emma
,
the
sister
of
Richard
Duke
of
Normandy
;
a
lady
who
was
called
the
Flower
of
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
a
terrible
deed
was
done
in
England
,
<EOS>
the
like
of
which
was
never
done
on
English
ground
before
or
since
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
thirteenth
of
November
,
in
pursuance
of
secret
instructions
sent
by
the
King
over
the
whole
country
,
the
inhabitants
of
every
town
and
city
armed
,
and
murdered
all
the
Danes
who
were
their
neighbours
.
  
<EOS>
Young
and
old
,
babies
and
soldiers
,
men
and
women
,
every
Dane
was
killed
.
 
<EOS>
No
doubt
there
were
among
them
many
ferocious
men
who
had
done
the
English
great
wrong
,
and
whose
pride
and
insolence
,
in
swaggering
in
the
houses
of
the
English
and
insulting
their
wives
and
daughters
,
had
become
unbearable
;
but
no
doubt
there
were
also
among
them
many
peaceful
Christian
Danes
who
had
married
English
women
and
become
like
English
men
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
slain
,
even
to
GUNHILDA
,
the
sister
of
the
King
of
Denmark
,
married
to
an
English
lord
;
who
was
first
obliged
to
see
the
murder
of
her
husband
and
her
child
,
and
then
was
killed
herself
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
King
of
the
sea
-
kings
heard
of
this
deed
of
blood
,
he
swore
that
he
would
have
a
great
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
an
army
,
and
a
mightier
fleet
of
ships
than
ever
yet
had
sailed
to
England
;
and
in
all
his
army
there
was
not
a
slave
or
an
old
man
,
but
every
soldier
was
a
free
man
,
and
the
son
of
a
free
man
,
and
in
the
prime
of
life
,
and
sworn
to
be
revenged
upon
the
English
nation
,
for
the
massacre
of
that
dread
thirteenth
of
November
,
when
his
countrymen
and
countrywomen
,
and
the
little
children
whom
they
loved
,
were
killed
with
fire
and
sword
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
the
sea
-
kings
came
to
England
in
many
great
ships
,
each
bearing
the
flag
of
its
own
commander
.
<EOS>
Golden
eagles
,
ravens
,
dragons
,
dolphins
,
beasts
of
prey
,
threatened
England
from
the
prows
of
those
ships
,
as
they
came
onward
through
the
water
;
and
were
reflected
in
the
shining
shields
that
hung
upon
their
sides
.
 
<EOS>
The
ship
that
bore
the
standard
of
the
King
of
the
sea
-
kings
was
carved
and
painted
like
a
mighty
serpent
;
and
the
King
in
his
anger
prayed
that
the
Gods
in
whom
he
trusted
might
all
desert
him
,
if
his
serpent
did
not
strike
its
fangs
into
England
's
heart
.
  
<EOS>
And
indeed
it
did
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
great
army
landing
from
the
great
fleet
,
near
Exeter
,
went
forward
,
laying
England
waste
,
and
striking
their
lances
in
the
earth
as
they
advanced
,
or
throwing
them
into
rivers
,
in
token
of
their
making
all
the
island
theirs
.
<EOS>
In
remembrance
of
the
black
November
night
when
the
Danes
were
murdered
,
wheresoever
the
invaders
came
,
they
made
the
Saxons
prepare
and
spread
for
them
great
feasts
;
and
when
they
had
eaten
those
feasts
,
and
had
drunk
a
curse
to
England
with
wild
rejoicings
,
they
drew
their
swords
,
and
killed
their
Saxon
entertainers
,
and
marched
on
.
 
<EOS>
For
six
long
years
they
carried
on
this
war
:
 
burning
the
crops
,
farmhouses
,
barns
,
mills
,
granaries
;
killing
the
labourers
in
the
fields
;
preventing
the
seed
from
being
sown
in
the
ground
;
causing
famine
and
starvation
;
leaving
only
heaps
of
ruin
and
smoking
ashes
,
where
they
had
found
rich
towns
.
<EOS>
To
crown
this
misery
,
English
officers
and
men
deserted
,
and
even
the
favourites
of
Ethelred
the
Unready
,
becoming
traitors
,
seized
many
of
the
English
ships
,
turned
pirates
against
their
own
country
,
and
aided
by
a
storm
<EOS>
occasioned
the
loss
of
nearly
the
whole
English
navy
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
but
one
man
of
note
,
at
this
miserable
pass
,
who
was
true
to
his
country
and
the
feeble
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
priest
,
and
a
brave
one
.
 
<EOS>
For
twenty
days
,
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
defended
that
city
against
its
Danish
besiegers
;
and
when
a
traitor
in
the
town
threw
the
gates
open
and
admitted
them
,
he
said
,
in
chains
,
"
I
will
not
buy
my
life
with
money
that
must
be
extorted
from
the
suffering
people
.
 
<EOS>
Do
with
me
what
you
please
!
"
 
<EOS>
Again
and
again
,
he
steadily
refused
to
purchase
his
release
with
gold
wrung
from
the
poor
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
Danes
being
tired
of
this
,
and
being
assembled
at
a
drunken
merry
-
making
,
had
him
brought
into
the
feasting
-
hall
.
  
<EOS>
"
Now
,
bishop
,
"
they
said
,
"
we
want
gold
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
looked
round
on
the
crowd
of
angry
faces
;
from
the
shaggy
beards
close
to
him
,
to
the
shaggy
beards
against
the
walls
,
where
men
were
mounted
on
tables
and
forms
to
see
him
over
the
heads
of
others
:
 
and
he
knew
that
his
time
was
come
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
have
no
gold
,
"
he
said
.
  
<EOS>
"
Get
it
,
bishop
!
<EOS>
"
they
all
thundered
.
  
<EOS>
"
That
,
I
have
often
told
you
I
will
not
,
"
said
he
.
  
<EOS>
They
gathered
closer
round
him
,
threatening
,
but
he
stood
unmoved
.
<EOS>
Then
,
one
man
struck
him
;
then
,
another
;
then
a
cursing
soldier
picked
up
from
a
heap
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
,
where
fragments
had
been
rudely
thrown
at
dinner
,
a
great
ox
-
bone
,
and
cast
it
at
his
face
,
from
which
the
blood
came
spurting
forth
;
then
,
others
ran
to
the
same
heap
,
and
knocked
him
down
with
other
bones
,
and
bruised
and
battered
him
;
until
one
soldier
whom
he
had
baptised
(
willing
,
as
I
hope
for
the
sake
of
that
soldier
's
soul
,
to
shorten
the
sufferings
of
the
good
man
)
struck
him
dead
with
his
battle
-
axe
.
  
<EOS>
If
Ethelred
had
had
the
heart
to
emulate
the
courage
of
this
noble
archbishop
,
he
might
have
done
something
yet
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
paid
the
Danes
forty
-
eight
thousand
pounds
,
instead
,
and
gained
so
little
by
the
cowardly
act
,
that
Sweyn
soon
afterwards
came
over
to
subdue
all
England
.
 
<EOS>
So
broken
was
the
attachment
of
the
English
people
,
by
this
time
,
to
their
incapable
King
and
their
forlorn
country
which
could
not
protect
them
,
that
they
welcomed
Sweyn
on
all
sides
,
as
a
deliverer
.
 
<EOS>
London
faithfully
stood
out
,
as
long
as
the
King
was
within
its
walls
;
but
,
when
he
sneaked
away
,
it
also
welcomed
the
Dane
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
all
was
over
;
and
the
King
took
refuge
abroad
with
the
Duke
of
Normandy
,
who
had
already
given
shelter
to
the
King
's
wife
,
once
the
Flower
of
that
country
,
and
to
her
children
.
  
<EOS>
Still
,
the
English
people
,
in
spite
of
their
sad
sufferings
,
could
not
quite
forget
the
great
King
Alfred
and
the
Saxon
race
.
 
<EOS>
When
Sweyn
died
suddenly
,
in
little
more
than
a
month
after
he
had
been
proclaimed
King
of
England
,
they
generously
sent
to
Ethelred
,
to
say
that
they
would
have
him
for
their
King
again
,
"
if
he
would
only
govern
them
better
than
he
had
governed
them
before
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Unready
,
instead
of
coming
himself
,
sent
Edward
,
one
of
his
sons
,
to
make
promises
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
followed
,
and
the
English
declared
him
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
Danes
declared
CANUTE
,
the
son
of
Sweyn
,
King
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
direful
war
began
again
,
and
lasted
for
three
years
,
when
the
Unready
died
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
know
of
nothing
better
that
he
did
,
in
all
his
reign
of
eight
and
thirty
years
.
  
<EOS>
Was
Canute
to
be
King
now
?
 
<EOS>
Not
over
the
Saxons
,
they
said
;
they
must
have
EDMUND
,
one
of
the
sons
of
the
Unready
,
who
was
surnamed
IRONSIDE
,
because
of
his
strength
and
stature
.
 
<EOS>
Edmund
and
Canute
thereupon
fell
to
,
and
fought
five
battles
---
O
unhappy
England
,
<EOS>
what
a
fighting
-
ground
it
was
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
then
Ironside
,
who
was
a
big
man
,
proposed
to
Canute
,
who
was
a
little
man
,
that
they
two
should
fight
it
out
in
single
combat
.
 
<EOS>
If
Canute
had
been
the
big
man
,
he
would
probably
have
said
yes
,
but
,
being
the
little
man
,
he
decidedly
said
no
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
declared
that
he
was
willing
to
divide
the
kingdom
---
to
take
all
that
lay
north
of
Watling
Street
,
as
the
old
Roman
military
road
from
Dover
to
Chester
was
called
,
and
to
give
Ironside
all
that
lay
south
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Most
men
being
weary
of
so
much
bloodshed
,
this
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
But
Canute
soon
became
sole
King
of
England
;
for
Ironside
died
suddenly
within
two
months
.
<EOS>
Some
think
that
he
was
killed
,
and
killed
by
Canute
's
orders
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
knows
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Canute
<EOS>
the
Dane
    
CANUTE
reigned
eighteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
merciless
King
at
first
.
<EOS>
After
he
had
clasped
the
hands
of
the
Saxon
chiefs
,
in
token
of
the
sincerity
with
which
he
swore
to
be
just
and
good
to
them
in
return
for
their
acknowledging
him
,
he
denounced
and
slew
many
of
them
,
as
well
as
many
relations
of
the
late
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
who
brings
me
the
head
of
one
of
my
enemies
,
"
he
used
to
say
,
"
shall
be
dearer
to
me
than
a
brother
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
was
so
severe
in
hunting
down
his
enemies
,
that
he
must
have
got
together
a
pretty
large
family
of
these
dear
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
strongly
inclined
to
kill
EDMUND
and
EDWARD
,
two
children
,
sons
of
poor
Ironside
;
but
,
being
afraid
to
do
so
in
England
<EOS>
,
he
sent
them
over
to
the
King
of
Sweden
,
with
a
request
that
the
King
would
be
so
good
as
"
dispose
of
them
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
If
the
King
of
Sweden
had
been
like
many
,
many
other
men
of
that
day
,
he
would
have
had
their
innocent
throats
cut
;
but
he
was
a
kind
man
,
and
brought
them
up
tenderly
.
  
<EOS>
Normandy
ran
much
in
Canute
's
mind
.
 
<EOS>
In
Normandy
were
the
two
children
of
the
late
king
---
EDWARD
and
ALFRED
by
name
;
and
their
uncle
the
Duke
<EOS>
might
one
day
claim
the
crown
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
showed
so
little
inclination
to
do
so
now
,
that
he
proposed
to
Canute
to
marry
his
sister
,
the
widow
of
The
Unready
;
who
,
being
but
a
showy
flower
,
and
caring
for
nothing
so
much
as
becoming
a
queen
again
,
left
her
children
and
was
wedded
to
him
.
  
<EOS>
Successful
and
triumphant
,
assisted
by
the
valour
of
the
English
in
his
foreign
wars
,
and
with
little
strife
to
trouble
him
at
home
,
Canute
had
a
prosperous
reign
,
and
made
many
improvements
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
poet
and
a
musician
.
 
<EOS>
He
grew
sorry
,
as
he
grew
older
,
for
the
blood
he
had
shed
at
first
;
and
went
to
Rome
in
a
Pilgrim
's
dress
,
by
way
of
washing
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
a
great
deal
of
money
to
foreigners
on
his
journey
;
but
he
took
it
from
the
English
before
he
started
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
however
,
he
certainly
became
a
far
better
man
when
he
had
no
opposition
to
contend
with
,
and
was
as
great
a
King
as
England
had
known
for
some
time
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
writers
of
history
relate
how
that
Canute
was
one
day
disgusted
with
his
courtiers
for
their
flattery
,
and
how
he
caused
his
chair
to
be
set
on
the
sea
-
shore
,
and
feigned
to
command
the
tide
as
it
came
up
not
to
wet
the
edge
of
his
robe
,
for
the
land
was
his
;
how
the
tide
came
up
,
of
course
,
without
regarding
him
;
and
how
he
then
turned
to
his
flatterers
,
and
rebuked
them
,
saying
,
what
was
the
might
of
any
earthly
king
,
to
the
might
of
the
Creator
,
who
could
say
unto
the
sea
,
"
Thus
far
shalt
thou
go
,
and
no
farther
!
"
 
<EOS>
We
may
learn
from
this
,
I
think
,
that
a
little
sense
will
go
a
long
way
in
a
king
;
and
that
courtiers
are
not
easily
cured
of
flattery
,
nor
kings
of
a
liking
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
courtiers
of
Canute
had
not
known
,
long
before
,
that
the
King
was
fond
of
flattery
,
they
would
have
known
better
than
to
offer
it
in
such
large
doses
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
they
had
not
known
that
he
was
vain
of
this
speech
(
anything
but
a
wonderful
speech
it
seems
to
me
,
if
a
good
child
had
made
it
)
,
they
would
not
have
been
at
such
great
pains
to
repeat
it
.
 
<EOS>
I
fancy
<EOS>
I
see
them
all
on
the
sea
-
shore
together
;
the
King
's
chair
sinking
in
the
sand
;
the
King
in
a
mighty
good
humour
with
his
own
wisdom
;
and
the
courtiers
pretending
to
be
quite
stunned
by
it
!
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
the
sea
alone
that
is
bidden
to
go
"
thus
far
,
and
no
farther
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
great
command
goes
forth
to
all
the
kings
upon
the
earth
,
and
went
to
Canute
in
the
year
one
thousand
and
thirty
-
five
,
and
stretched
him
dead
upon
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
Beside
it
,
stood
his
Norman
wife
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
as
the
King
looked
his
last
upon
her
,
he
,
who
had
so
often
thought
distrustfully
of
Normandy
,
long
ago
,
thought
once
more
of
the
two
exiled
Princes
in
their
uncle
's
court
,
and
of
the
little
favour
they
could
feel
for
either
Danes
or
Saxons
,
and
of
a
rising
cloud
in
Normandy
that
slowly
moved
towards
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Harold
Harefoot
,
Hardicanute
,
and
Edward
the
Confessor
    
CANUTE
left
three
sons
,
by
name
SWEYN
,
HAROLD
,
and
HARDICANUTE
;
but
his
Queen
,
Emma
,
once
the
Flower
of
Normandy
,
was
the
mother
of
only
Hardicanute
.
 
<EOS>
Canute
had
wished
his
dominions
to
be
divided
between
the
three
,
and
had
wished
Harold
to
have
England
;
but
the
Saxon
people
in
the
South
of
England
,
headed
by
a
nobleman
with
great
possessions
,
called
the
powerful
EARL
GODWIN
(
who
is
said
to
have
been
originally
a
poor
cow
-
boy
)
,
opposed
this
,
and
desired
to
have
,
instead
,
either
Hardicanute
,
or
one
of
the
two
exiled
Princes
who
were
over
in
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
It
seemed
so
certain
that
there
would
be
more
bloodshed
to
settle
this
dispute
,
that
many
people
left
their
homes
,
and
took
refuge
in
the
woods
and
swamps
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
however
,
it
was
agreed
to
refer
the
whole
question
to
a
great
meeting
at
Oxford
,
which
decided
that
Harold
should
have
all
the
country
north
of
the
Thames
,
with
London
for
his
capital
city
,
and
that
Hardicanute
should
have
all
the
south
.
 
<EOS>
The
quarrel
was
so
arranged
;
and
,
as
Hardicanute
was
in
Denmark
troubling
himself
very
little
about
anything
but
eating
and
getting
drunk
,
his
mother
and
Earl
Godwin
<EOS>
governed
the
south
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
They
had
hardly
begun
to
do
so
,
and
the
trembling
people
who
had
hidden
themselves
were
scarcely
at
home
again
,
when
Edward
,
the
elder
of
the
two
exiled
Princes
,
came
over
from
Normandy
with
a
few
followers
,
to
claim
the
English
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
Emma
,
however
,
who
only
cared
for
her
last
son
Hardicanute
,
instead
of
assisting
him
,
as
he
expected
,
opposed
him
so
strongly
with
all
her
influence
that
he
was
very
soon
glad
to
get
safely
back
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
Alfred
was
not
so
fortunate
.
 
<EOS>
Believing
in
an
affectionate
letter
,
written
some
time
afterwards
to
him
and
his
brother
,
in
his
mother
's
name
(
but
whether
really
with
or
without
his
mother
's
knowledge
is
now
uncertain
)
,
he
allowed
himself
to
be
tempted
over
to
England
,
with
a
good
force
of
soldiers
,
and
landing
on
the
Kentish
coast
,
and
being
met
and
welcomed
by
Earl
Godwin
,
proceeded
into
Surrey
,
as
far
as
the
town
of
Guildford
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
he
and
his
men
halted
in
the
evening
to
rest
,
having
still
the
Earl
in
their
company
;
who
had
ordered
lodgings
and
good
cheer
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
when
they
were
off
their
guard
,
being
divided
into
small
parties
sleeping
soundly
after
a
long
march
and
a
plentiful
supper
in
different
houses
,
they
were
set
upon
by
the
King
's
troops
,
and
taken
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
they
were
drawn
out
in
a
line
,
to
the
number
of
six
hundred
men
,
and
were
barbarously
tortured
and
killed
;
with
the
exception
of
every
tenth
man
,
who
was
sold
into
slavery
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
wretched
Prince
Alfred
,
he
was
stripped
naked
,
tied
to
a
horse
and
sent
away
into
the
Isle
of
Ely
,
where
his
eyes
were
torn
out
of
his
head
,
and
where
in
a
few
days
he
miserably
died
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
not
sure
that
the
Earl
had
wilfully
entrapped
him
,
but
I
suspect
it
strongly
.
  
<EOS>
Harold
was
now
King
all
over
England
,
though
it
is
doubtful
whether
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
(
the
greater
part
of
the
priests
were
Saxons
,
and
not
friendly
to
the
Danes
)
ever
consented
to
crown
him
.
<EOS>
Crowned
or
uncrowned
,
with
the
Archbishop
's
leave
or
without
it
,
he
was
King
for
four
years
:
 
after
which
short
reign
he
died
,
and
was
buried
;
having
never
done
much
in
life
but
go
a
hunting
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
such
a
fast
runner
at
this
,
his
favourite
sport
,
that
the
people
called
him
Harold
Harefoot
.
  
<EOS>
Hardicanute
was
then
at
Bruges
,
in
Flanders
,
plotting
,
with
his
mother
(
who
had
gone
over
there
after
the
cruel
murder
of
Prince
Alfred
)
,
for
the
invasion
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
Danes
and
Saxons
,
finding
themselves
without
a
King
,
and
dreading
new
disputes
,
made
common
cause
,
and
joined
in
inviting
him
to
occupy
the
Throne
.
 
<EOS>
He
consented
,
and
soon
troubled
them
enough
;
for
he
brought
over
numbers
of
Danes
,
and
taxed
the
people
so
insupportably
to
enrich
those
greedy
favourites
that
there
were
many
insurrections
,
especially
one
at
Worcester
,
where
the
citizens
rose
and
killed
his
tax
-
collectors
;
in
revenge
for
which
he
burned
their
city
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
brutal
King
,
whose
first
public
act
was
to
order
the
dead
body
of
poor
Harold
Harefoot
to
be
dug
up
,
beheaded
,
and
thrown
into
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
His
end
was
worthy
of
such
a
beginning
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
down
drunk
,
with
a
goblet
of
wine
in
his
hand
,
at
a
wedding
-
feast
at
Lambeth
,
given
in
honour
of
the
marriage
of
his
standard
-
bearer
,
a
Dane
named
TOWED
THE
PROUD
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
never
spoke
again
.
  
<EOS>
EDWARD
,
afterwards
called
by
the
monks
THE
CONFESSOR
,
succeeded
;
and
his
first
act
was
to
oblige
his
mother
Emma
,
who
had
favoured
him
so
little
,
to
retire
into
the
country
;
where
she
died
some
ten
years
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
exiled
prince
whose
brother
Alfred
had
been
so
foully
killed
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
invited
over
from
Normandy
by
Hardicanute
,
in
the
course
of
his
short
reign
of
two
years
,
and
had
been
handsomely
treated
at
court
.
 
<EOS>
His
cause
was
now
favoured
by
the
powerful
Earl
Godwin
,
and
he
was
soon
made
King
.
 
<EOS>
This
Earl
had
been
suspected
by
the
people
,
ever
since
Prince
Alfred
's
cruel
death
;
he
had
even
been
tried
in
the
last
reign
for
the
Prince
's
murder
,
but
had
been
pronounced
not
guilty
;
chiefly
,
as
it
was
supposed
,
because
of
a
present
he
had
made
to
the
swinish
King
,
of
a
gilded
ship
with
a
figure
-
head
of
solid
gold
,
and
a
crew
of
eighty
splendidly
armed
men
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
his
interest
to
help
the
new
King
with
his
power
,
if
the
new
King
would
help
him
against
the
popular
distrust
and
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
made
a
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
the
Confessor
got
the
Throne
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
got
more
power
and
more
land
,
and
his
daughter
Editha
was
made
queen
;
for
it
was
a
part
of
their
compact
that
the
King
should
take
her
for
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
although
she
was
a
gentle
lady
,
in
all
things
worthy
to
be
beloved
---
good
,
beautiful
,
sensible
,
and
kind
---
the
King
from
the
first
neglected
her
.
 
<EOS>
Her
father
and
her
six
proud
brothers
,
resenting
this
cold
treatment
,
harassed
the
King
greatly
by
exerting
all
their
power
to
make
him
unpopular
.
 
<EOS>
Having
lived
so
long
in
Normandy
,
he
preferred
the
Normans
to
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
Norman
Archbishop
,
and
Norman
Bishops
;
his
great
officers
and
favourites
were
all
Normans
;
he
introduced
the
Norman
fashions
and
the
Norman
language
;
in
imitation
of
the
state
custom
of
Normandy
,
he
attached
a
great
seal
to
his
state
documents
,
instead
of
merely
marking
them
,
as
the
Saxon
Kings
had
done
,
with
the
sign
of
the
cross
---
just
as
poor
people
who
have
never
been
taught
to
write
,
now
make
the
same
mark
for
their
names
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
,
the
powerful
Earl
Godwin
and
his
six
proud
sons
represented
to
the
people
as
disfavour
shown
towards
the
English
;
and
thus
they
daily
increased
their
own
power
,
and
daily
diminished
the
power
of
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
They
were
greatly
helped
by
an
event
that
occurred
when
he
had
reigned
eight
years
.
 
<EOS>
Eustace
,
Earl
of
Bologne
,
who
had
married
the
King
's
sister
,
came
to
England
on
a
visit
.
 
<EOS>
After
staying
at
the
court
some
time
,
he
set
forth
,
with
his
numerous
train
of
attendants
,
to
return
home
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
to
embark
at
Dover
.
<EOS>
Entering
that
peaceful
town
in
armour
,
they
took
possession
of
the
best
houses
,
and
noisily
demanded
to
be
lodged
and
entertained
without
payment
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
bold
men
of
Dover
,
who
would
not
endure
to
have
these
domineering
strangers
jingling
their
heavy
swords
and
iron
corselets
up
and
down
his
house
,
eating
his
meat
and
drinking
his
strong
liquor
,
stood
in
his
doorway
and
refused
admission
to
the
first
armed
man
who
came
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
armed
man
drew
,
and
wounded
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
man
of
Dover
struck
the
armed
man
dead
.
<EOS>
Intelligence
of
what
he
had
done
,
spreading
through
the
streets
to
where
the
Count
Eustace
and
his
men
were
standing
by
their
horses
,
bridle
in
hand
,
they
passionately
mounted
,
galloped
to
the
house
,
surrounded
it
,
forced
their
way
in
(
the
doors
and
windows
being
closed
when
they
came
up
)
,
and
killed
the
man
of
Dover
at
his
own
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
clattered
through
the
streets
,
cutting
down
and
riding
over
men
,
women
,
and
children
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
last
long
,
you
may
believe
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
of
Dover
set
upon
them
with
great
fury
,
killed
nineteen
of
the
foreigners
,
wounded
many
more
,
and
,
blockading
the
road
to
the
port
so
that
they
should
not
embark
,
beat
them
out
of
the
town
by
the
way
they
had
come
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
Count
Eustace
rides
as
hard
as
man
can
ride
to
Gloucester
,
where
Edward
is
,
surrounded
by
Norman
monks
and
Norman
lords
.
 
<EOS>
"
Justice
!
"
<EOS>
cries
the
Count
,
"
upon
the
men
of
Dover
,
who
have
set
upon
and
slain
my
people
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
King
sends
immediately
for
the
powerful
Earl
Godwin
,
who
happens
to
be
near
;
reminds
him
that
Dover
is
under
his
government
;
and
orders
him
to
repair
to
Dover
and
do
military
execution
on
the
inhabitants
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
does
not
become
you
,
"
says
the
proud
Earl
in
reply
,
"
to
condemn
without
a
hearing
those
whom
you
have
sworn
to
protect
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
do
it
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
therefore
,
summoned
the
Earl
,
on
pain
of
banishment
and
loss
of
his
titles
and
property
,
to
appear
before
the
court
to
answer
this
disobedience
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
refused
to
appear
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
his
eldest
son
Harold
,
and
his
second
son
Sweyn
,
hastily
raised
as
many
fighting
men
as
their
utmost
power
could
collect
,
and
demanded
to
have
Count
Eustace
and
his
followers
surrendered
to
the
justice
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
in
his
turn
,
refused
to
give
them
up
,
and
raised
a
strong
force
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
treaty
and
delay
,
the
troops
of
the
great
Earl
and
his
sons
began
to
fall
off
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
,
with
a
part
of
his
family
and
abundance
of
treasure
,
sailed
to
Flanders
;
Harold
escaped
to
Ireland
;
and
the
power
of
the
great
family
was
for
that
time
gone
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
people
did
not
forget
them
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
Edward
the
Confessor
,
with
the
true
meanness
of
a
mean
spirit
,
visited
his
dislike
of
the
once
powerful
father
and
sons
upon
the
helpless
daughter
and
sister
,
his
unoffending
wife
,
whom
all
who
saw
her
(
her
husband
and
his
monks
excepted
)
loved
.
 
<EOS>
He
seized
rapaciously
upon
her
fortune
and
her
jewels
,
and
allowing
her
only
one
attendant
,
confined
her
in
a
gloomy
convent
,
of
which
a
sister
of
his
---
no
doubt
an
unpleasant
lady
after
his
own
heart
---
was
abbess
or
jailer
.
  
<EOS>
Having
got
Earl
Godwin
and
his
six
sons
well
out
of
his
way
,
the
King
favoured
the
Normans
more
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
invited
over
WILLIAM
,
DUKE
OF
NORMANDY
,
the
son
of
that
Duke
who
had
received
him
and
his
murdered
brother
long
ago
,
and
of
a
peasant
girl
,
a
tanner
's
daughter
,
with
whom
that
Duke
had
fallen
in
love
for
her
beauty
as
he
saw
her
washing
clothes
in
a
brook
.
 
<EOS>
William
,
who
was
a
great
warrior
,
with
a
passion
for
fine
horses
,
dogs
,
and
arms
,
accepted
the
invitation
;
and
the
Normans
in
England
,
finding
themselves
more
numerous
than
ever
when
he
arrived
with
his
retinue
,
and
held
in
still
greater
honour
at
court
than
before
,
became
more
and
more
haughty
towards
the
people
,
and
were
more
and
more
disliked
by
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
Earl
Godwin
,
though
he
was
abroad
,
knew
well
how
the
people
felt
;
for
,
with
part
of
the
treasure
he
had
carried
away
with
him
,
he
kept
spies
and
agents
in
his
pay
all
over
England
.
  
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
thought
the
time
was
come
for
fitting
out
a
great
expedition
against
the
Norman
-
loving
King
.
 
<EOS>
With
it
,
he
sailed
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
where
he
was
joined
by
his
son
Harold
,
the
most
gallant
and
brave
of
all
his
family
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
the
father
and
son
came
sailing
up
the
Thames
to
Southwark
;
great
numbers
of
the
people
declaring
for
them
,
and
shouting
for
the
English
Earl
and
the
English
Harold
,
against
the
Norman
favourites
!
  
<EOS>
The
King
was
at
first
as
blind
and
stubborn
as
kings
usually
have
been
whensoever
they
have
been
in
the
hands
of
monks
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
people
rallied
so
thickly
round
the
old
Earl
and
his
son
,
and
the
old
Earl
was
so
steady
in
demanding
without
bloodshed
the
restoration
of
himself
and
his
family
to
their
rights
,
that
at
last
the
court
took
the
alarm
.
 
<EOS>
The
Norman
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
the
Norman
Bishop
of
London
,
surrounded
by
their
retainers
,
fought
their
way
out
of
London
,
and
escaped
from
Essex
to
France
in
a
fishing
-
boat
.
 
<EOS>
The
other
Norman
favourites
dispersed
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
Earl
and
his
sons
(
except
Sweyn
,
who
had
committed
crimes
against
the
law
)
were
restored
to
their
possessions
and
dignities
.
 
<EOS>
Editha
,
the
virtuous
and
lovely
Queen
of
the
insensible
King
,
was
triumphantly
released
from
her
prison
,
the
convent
,
and
once
more
sat
in
her
chair
of
state
,
arrayed
in
the
jewels
of
which
,
when
she
had
no
champion
to
support
her
rights
,
her
cold
-
blooded
husband
had
deprived
her
.
  
<EOS>
The
old
Earl
Godwin
did
not
long
enjoy
his
restored
fortune
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
down
in
a
fit
at
the
King
's
table
,
and
died
upon
the
third
day
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Harold
succeeded
to
his
power
,
and
to
a
far
higher
place
in
the
attachment
of
the
people
than
his
father
had
ever
held
.
 
<EOS>
By
his
valour
he
subdued
the
King
's
enemies
in
many
bloody
fights
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
vigorous
against
rebels
in
Scotland
<EOS>
---
this
was
the
time
when
Macbeth
slew
Duncan
,
upon
which
event
our
English
Shakespeare
,
hundreds
of
years
afterwards
,
wrote
his
great
tragedy
;
and
he
killed
the
restless
Welsh
King
GRIFFITH
,
and
brought
his
head
to
England
.
  
<EOS>
What
Harold
was
doing
at
sea
,
when
he
was
driven
on
the
French
coast
by
a
tempest
,
is
not
at
all
certain
;
nor
does
it
at
all
matter
.
 
<EOS>
That
his
ship
was
forced
by
a
storm
on
that
shore
,
and
that
he
was
taken
prisoner
,
there
is
no
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
barbarous
days
,
all
shipwrecked
strangers
were
taken
prisoners
,
and
obliged
to
pay
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
a
certain
Count
Guy
,
who
was
the
Lord
of
Ponthieu
where
Harold
's
disaster
happened
,
seized
him
,
instead
of
relieving
him
like
a
hospitable
and
Christian
lord
as
he
ought
to
have
done
,
and
expected
to
make
a
very
good
thing
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
Harold
sent
off
immediately
to
Duke
William
of
Normandy
,
complaining
of
this
treatment
;
and
the
Duke
no
sooner
heard
of
it
than
he
ordered
Harold
to
be
escorted
to
the
ancient
town
of
Rouen
,
where
he
then
was
,
and
where
he
received
him
as
an
honoured
guest
.
<EOS>
Now
,
some
writers
tell
us
that
Edward
the
Confessor
,
who
was
by
this
time
old
and
had
no
children
,
had
made
a
will
,
appointing
Duke
William
of
Normandy
his
successor
,
and
had
informed
the
Duke
of
his
having
done
so
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
he
was
anxious
about
his
successor
;
because
he
had
even
invited
over
,
from
abroad
,
EDWARD
THE
OUTLAW
,
a
son
of
Ironside
,
who
had
come
to
England
with
his
wife
and
three
children
,
but
whom
the
King
had
strangely
refused
to
see
when
he
did
come
,
and
who
had
died
in
London
suddenly
(
princes
were
terribly
liable
to
sudden
death
in
those
days
)
,
and
had
been
buried
in
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
might
possibly
have
made
such
a
will
;
or
,
having
always
been
fond
of
the
Normans
,
he
might
have
encouraged
Norman
William
to
aspire
to
the
English
crown
,
by
something
that
he
said
to
him
when
he
was
staying
at
the
English
court
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
certainly
William
did
now
aspire
to
it
;
and
knowing
that
Harold
would
be
a
powerful
rival
,
he
called
together
a
great
assembly
of
his
nobles
,
offered
Harold
his
daughter
ADELE
in
marriage
,
informed
him
that
he
meant
on
King
Edward
's
death
to
claim
the
English
crown
as
his
own
inheritance
,
and
required
Harold
then
and
there
to
swear
to
aid
him
.
 
<EOS>
Harold
,
being
in
the
Duke
's
power
,
took
this
oath
upon
the
Missal
,
or
Prayer
-
book
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
good
example
of
the
superstitions
of
the
monks
,
that
this
Missal
,
instead
of
being
placed
upon
a
table
,
was
placed
upon
a
tub
;
which
,
when
Harold
had
sworn
,
was
uncovered
,
and
shown
to
be
full
of
dead
men
's
bones
---
bones
,
as
the
monks
pretended
,
of
saints
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
supposed
to
make
Harold
's
oath
a
great
deal
more
impressive
and
binding
.
 
<EOS>
As
if
the
great
name
of
the
Creator
of
Heaven
and
earth
could
be
made
more
solemn
by
a
knuckle
-
bone
,
or
a
double
-
tooth
,
or
a
finger
-
nail
,
of
Dunstan
!
  
<EOS>
Within
a
week
or
two
after
Harold
's
return
to
England
,
the
dreary
old
Confessor
was
found
to
be
dying
.
 
<EOS>
After
wandering
in
his
mind
like
a
very
weak
old
man
,
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
put
himself
entirely
in
the
hands
of
the
monks
when
he
was
alive
,
they
praised
him
lustily
when
he
was
dead
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
gone
so
far
,
already
,
as
to
persuade
him
that
he
could
work
miracles
;
and
had
brought
people
afflicted
with
a
bad
disorder
of
the
skin
,
to
him
,
to
be
touched
and
cured
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
called
"
touching
for
the
King
's
Evil
,
"
which
afterwards
became
a
royal
custom
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
,
however
,
Who
really
touched
the
sick
,
and
healed
them
;
and
you
know
His
sacred
name
is
not
among
the
dusty
line
of
human
kings
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Harold
the
Second
,
and
Conquered
by
the
Normans
    
<EOS>
HAROLD
was
crowned
King
of
England
on
the
very
day
of
the
maudlin
Confessor
's
funeral
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
good
need
to
be
quick
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
news
reached
Norman
William
,
hunting
in
his
park
at
Rouen
,
he
dropped
his
bow
,
returned
to
his
palace
,
called
his
nobles
to
council
,
and
presently
sent
ambassadors
to
Harold
,
calling
on
him
to
keep
his
oath
and
resign
the
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
Harold
would
do
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
The
barons
of
France
leagued
together
round
Duke
William
for
the
invasion
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Duke
William
promised
freely
to
distribute
English
wealth
and
English
lands
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
sent
to
Normandy
a
consecrated
banner
,
and
a
ring
containing
a
hair
which
he
warranted
to
have
grown
on
the
head
of
Saint
Peter
.
 
<EOS>
He
blessed
the
enterprise
;
and
cursed
Harold
;
and
requested
that
the
Normans
would
pay
"
Peter
's
Pence
"
---
or
a
tax
to
himself
of
a
penny
a
year
on
every
house
---
a
little
more
regularly
in
future
,
if
they
could
make
it
convenient

<EOS>
King
Harold
had
a
rebel
brother
in
Flanders
,
who
was
a
vassal
of
HAROLD
HARDRADA
,
King
of
Norway
.
 
<EOS>
This
brother
,
and
this
Norwegian
King
,
joining
their
forces
against
England
,
with
Duke
William
's
help
,
won
a
fight
in
which
the
English
were
commanded
by
two
nobles
;
and
then
besieged
York
.
 
<EOS>
Harold
,
who
was
waiting
for
the
Normans
on
the
coast
at
Hastings
,
with
his
army
,
marched
to
Stamford
Bridge
upon
the
river
Derwent
to
give
them
instant
battle
.
  
<EOS>
He
found
them
drawn
up
in
a
hollow
circle
,
marked
out
by
their
shining
spears
.
 
<EOS>
Riding
round
this
circle
at
a
distance
,
to
survey
it
,
he
saw
a
brave
figure
on
horseback
,
in
a
blue
mantle
and
a
bright
helmet
,
whose
horse
suddenly
stumbled
and
threw
him
.
  
<EOS>
"
Who
is
that
man
who
has
fallen
?
"
<EOS>
Harold
asked
of
one
of
his
captains
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
King
of
Norway
,
"
he
replied
.
  
<EOS>
"
He
is
a
tall
and
stately
king
,
"
said
Harold
,
"
but
his
end
is
near
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
added
,
in
a
little
while
,
"
Go
yonder
to
my
brother
,
and
tell
him
,
if
he
withdraw
his
troops
,
he
shall
be
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
and
rich
and
powerful
in
England
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
captain
rode
away
and
gave
the
message
.
  
<EOS>
"
What
will
he
give
to
my
friend
the
King
of
Norway
?
"
asked
the
brother
.
  
<EOS>
"
Seven
feet
of
earth
for
a
grave
,
"
replied
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
more
?
"
returned
the
brother
,
with
a
smile
.
  
<EOS>
"
The
King
of
Norway
being
a
tall
man
,
perhaps
a
little
more
,
"
replied
the
captain
.
  
<EOS>
"
Ride
back
!
"
said
the
brother
,
"
and
tell
King
Harold
to
make
ready
for
the
fight
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
very
soon
.
 
<EOS>
And
such
a
fight
King
Harold
led
against
that
force
,
that
his
brother
,
and
the
Norwegian
King
,
and
every
chief
of
note
in
all
their
host
,
except
the
Norwegian
King

son

Olave
,
to
whom
he
gave
honourable
dismissal
,
were
left
dead
upon
the
field

The
victorious
army
marched
to
York
.
 
<EOS>
As
King
Harold
sat
there
at
the
feast
,
in
the
midst
of
all
his
company
,
a
stir
was
heard
at
the
doors
;
and
messengers
all
covered
with
mire
from
riding
far
and
fast
through
broken
ground
came
hurrying
in
,
to
report
that
the
Normans
had
landed
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
The
intelligence
was
true
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
tossed
about
by
contrary
winds
,
and
some
of
their
ships
had
been
wrecked
.
 
<EOS>
A
part
of
their
own
shore
,
to
which
they
had
been
driven
back
,
was
strewn
with
Norman
bodies
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
had
once
more
made
sail
,
led
by
the
Duke
's
own
galley
,
a
present
from
his
wife
<EOS>
,
upon
the
prow
whereof
the
figure
of
a
golden
boy
stood
pointing
towards
England
.
 
<EOS>
By
day
,
the
banner
of
the
three
Lions
of
Normandy
,
the
diverse
coloured
sails
,
the
gilded
vans
,
the
many
decorations
of
this
gorgeous
ship
,
had
glittered
in
the
sun
and
sunny
water
;
by
night
,
a
light
had
sparkled
like
a
star
at
her
mast
-
head
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
encamped
near
Hastings
,
with
their
leader
lying
in
the
old
Roman
castle
of
Pevensey
,
the
English
retiring
in
all
directions
,
the
land
for
miles
around
scorched
and
smoking
,
fired
and
pillaged
,
was
the
whole
Norman
power
,
hopeful
and
strong
on
English
ground

<EOS>
Harold
broke
up
the
feast
and
hurried
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
Within
a
week
,
his
army
was
ready
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
out
spies
to
ascertain
the
Norman
strength
.
 
<EOS>
William
took
them
,
caused
them
to
be
led
through
his
whole
camp
,
and
then
dismissed
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Normans

"
said
these
spies
to
Harold

"
are
not
bearded
on

"
My

Harold

with

"
will

Let

said
Duke
William
.
  
<EOS>
Some
proposals
for
a
reconciliation
were
made
,
but
were
soon
abandoned
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
the
month
of
October
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
and
sixty
-
six
,
the
Normans
and
the
English
came
front
to
front
.
 
<EOS>
All
night
the
armies
lay
encamped
before
each
other
,
in
a
part
of
the
country
then
called
Senlac
,
now
called
(
in
remembrance
of
them
)
Battle
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
first
dawn
of
day
,
they
arose
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
in
the
faint
light
,
were
the
English
on
a
hill
;
a
wood
behind
them
;
in
their
midst
,
the
Royal
banner
,
representing
a
fighting
warrior
,
woven
in
gold
thread
,
adorned
with
precious
stones
;
beneath
the
banner
,
as
it
rustled
in
the
wind
,
stood
King
Harold
on
foot
,
with
two
of
his
remaining
brothers
by
his
side
;
around
them
,
still
and
silent
as
the
dead
,
clustered
the
whole
English
army
---
every
soldier
covered
by
his
shield
,
and
bearing
in
his
hand
his
dreaded
English
battle
-
axe
.
  
<EOS>
On
an
opposite
hill
,
in
three
lines
,
archers
,
foot
-
soldiers
,
horsemen
,
was
the
Norman
force
.
 
<EOS>
Of
a
sudden
,
a
great
battle
-
cry
,
"
God
help
us
!
"
<EOS>
burst
from
the
Norman
lines
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
answered
with
their
own
battle
-
cry
,
"
God
's
Rood
!
 
<EOS>
Holy
Rood
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
Normans
then
came
sweeping
down
the
hill
to
attack
the
English
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
one
tall
Norman
Knight
who
rode
before
the
Norman
army
on
a
prancing
horse
,
throwing
up
his
heavy
sword
and
catching
it
,
and
singing
of
the
bravery
of
his
countrymen
.
 
<EOS>
An
English
Knight
,
who
rode
out
from
the
English
force
to
meet
him
,
fell
by
this
Knight
's
hand
.
 
<EOS>
Another
English
Knight
rode
out
,
and
he
fell
too
.
 
<EOS>
But
then
a
third
rode
out
,
and
killed
the
Norman
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
in
the
first
beginning
of
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
raged
everywhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
,
keeping
side
by
side
in
a
great
mass
,
cared
no
more
for
the
showers
of
Norman
arrows
than
if
they
had
been
showers
of
Norman
rain
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Norman
horsemen
rode
against
them
,
with
their
battle
-
axes
they
cut
men
and
horses
down
.
 
<EOS>
The
Normans
gave
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
pressed
forward
.
 
<EOS>
A
cry
went
forth
among
the
Norman
troops
that
Duke
William
was
killed
.
 
<EOS>
Duke
William
took
off
his
helmet
,
in
order
that
his
face
might
be
distinctly
seen
,
and
rode
along
the
line
before
his
men
.
 
<EOS>
This
gave
them
courage
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
turned
again
to
face
the
English
,
some
of
their
Norman
horse
divided
the
pursuing
body
of
the
English
from
the
rest
,
and
thus
all
that
foremost
portion
of
the
English
army
fell
,
fighting
bravely
.
 
<EOS>
The
main
body
still
remaining
firm
,
heedless
of
the
Norman
arrows
,
and
with
their
battle
-
axes
cutting
down
the
crowds
of
horsemen
when
they
rode
up
,
like
forests
of
young
trees
,
Duke
William
pretended
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
The
eager
English
followed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Norman
army
closed
again
,
and
fell
upon
them
with
great
slaughter
.
  
<EOS>
"
Still
,
"
said
Duke
William
,
"
there
are
thousands
of
the
English
,
firms
as
rocks
around
their
King
.
 
<EOS>
Shoot
upward
,
Norman
archers
,
that
your
arrows
may
fall
down
upon
their
faces
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
sun
rose
high
,
and
sank
,
and
the
battle
still
raged
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
the
wild
October
day
,
the
clash
and
din
resounded
in
the
air
.
<EOS>
In
the
red
sunset
,
and
in
the
white
moonlight
,
heaps
upon
heaps
of
dead
men
lay
strewn
,
a
dreadful
spectacle
,
all
over
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
King
Harold
,
wounded
with
an
arrow
in
the
eye
,
was
nearly
blind
.
<EOS>
His
brothers
were
already
killed
.
 
<EOS>
Twenty
Norman
Knights
,
whose
battered
armour
had
flashed
fiery
and
golden
in
the
sunshine
all
day
long
,
and
now
looked
silvery
in
the
moonlight
,
dashed
forward
to
seize
the
Royal
banner
from
the
English
Knights
and
soldiers
,
still
faithfully
collected
round
their
blinded
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
received
a
mortal
wound
,
and
dropped
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
broke
and
fled
.
<EOS>
The
Normans
rallied
,
and
the
day
was
lost
.
  
<EOS>
O
what
a
sight
beneath
the
moon
and
stars
,
when
lights
were
shining
in
the
tent
of
the
victorious
Duke
William
,
which
was
pitched
near
the
spot
where
Harold
fell
---
and
he
and
his
knights
were
carousing
,
within
---
and
soldiers
with
torches
,
going
slowly
to

fro
,
without
,
sought
for
the
corpse
of
Harold
among
piles
of
dead

the
Warrior
,
worked
in
golden
thread
and
precious
stones
,
lay
low

all
torn
and
soiled
with
blood

the
three
Norman
Lions
kept
watch
over
the

England

William

the
First
,
the
Norman
Conqueror
    
UPON
the
ground
where
the
brave
Harold
fell
,
William
the
Norman
afterwards
founded
an
abbey
,
which
,
under
the
name
of
Battle
Abbey
,
was
a
rich
and
splendid
place
through
many
a
troubled
year
,
though
now
it
is
a
grey
ruin
overgrown
with
ivy
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
first
work
he
had
to
do
,
was
to
conquer
the
English
thoroughly
;
and
that
,
as
you
know
by
this
time
,
was
hard
work
for
any
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
ravaged
several
counties
;
he
burned
and
plundered
many
towns
;
he
laid
waste
scores
upon
scores
of
miles
of
pleasant
country
;
he
destroyed
innumerable
lives
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
STIGAND
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
with
other
representatives
of
the
clergy
and
the
people
,
went
to
his
camp
,
and
submitted
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
EDGAR
,
the
insignificant
son
of
Edmund
Ironside
,
was
proclaimed
King
by
others
,
but
nothing
came
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
fled
to
Scotland
afterwards
,
where
his
sister
,
who
was
young
and
beautiful
,
married
the
Scottish
King
.
 
<EOS>
Edgar
himself
was
not
important
enough
for
anybody
to
care
much
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
On
Christmas
Day
,
William
was
crowned
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
under
the
title
of
WILLIAM
THE
FIRST
;
but
he
is
best
known
as
WILLIAM
THE
CONQUEROR
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
strange
coronation
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
bishops
who
performed
the
ceremony
asked
the
Normans
,
in
French
,
if
they
would
have
Duke
William
for
their
king
?
 
<EOS>
They
answered
<EOS>
Yes
.
 
<EOS>
Another
of
the
bishops
put
the
same
question
to
the
Saxons
,
in
English
.
 
<EOS>
They
too
answered
<EOS>
Yes
,
with
a
loud
shout
.
 
<EOS>
The
noise
being
heard
by
a
guard
of
Norman
horse
-
soldiers
outside
,
was
mistaken
for
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
The
guard
instantly
set
fire
to
the
neighbouring
houses
,
and
a
tumult
ensued
;
in
the
midst
of
which
the
King
,
being
left
alone
in
the
Abbey
,
with
a
few
priests
(
and
they
all
being
in
a
terrible
fright
together
)
,
was
hurriedly
crowned
.
<EOS>
When
the
crown
was
placed
upon
his
head
,
he
swore
to
govern
the
English
as
well
as
the
best
of
their
own
monarchs
.
 
<EOS>
I
dare
<EOS>
say
you
think
,
as
I
do
,
that
if
we
except
the
Great
Alfred
,
he
might
pretty
easily
have
done
that
.
  
<EOS>
Numbers
of
the
English
nobles
had
been
killed
in
the
last
disastrous
battle
.
 
<EOS>
Their
estates
,
and
the
estates
of
all
the
nobles
who
had
fought
against
him
there
,
King
William
seized
upon
,
and
gave
to
his
own
Norman
knights
and
nobles
.
 
<EOS>
Many
great
English
families
of
the
present
time
acquired
their
English
lands
in
this
way
,
and
are
very
proud
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
But
what
is
got
by
force
must
be
maintained
by
force
.
 
<EOS>
These
nobles
were
obliged
to
build
castles
all
over
England
,
to
defend
their
new
property
;
and
,
do
what
he
would
,
the
King
could
neither
soothe
nor
quell
the
nation
as
he
wished
.
 
<EOS>
He
gradually
introduced
the
Norman
language
and
the
Norman
customs
;
yet
,
for
a
long
time
the
great
body
of
the
English
remained
sullen
and
revengeful
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
going
over
to
Normandy
,
to
visit
his
subjects
there
,
the
oppressions
of
his
half
-
brother
ODO
,
whom
he
left
in
charge
of
his
English
kingdom
,
drove
the
people
mad
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
of
Kent
even
invited
over
,
to
take
possession
of
Dover
,
their
old
enemy
Count
Eustace
of
Boulogne
,
who
had
led
the
fray
when
the
Dover
man
was
slain
at
his
own
fireside
.
 
<EOS>
The
men
of
Hereford
,
aided
by
the
Welsh
,
and
commanded
by
a
chief
named
EDRIC
THE
WILD
,
drove
the
Normans
out
of
their
country
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
those
who
had
been
dispossessed
of
their
lands
,
banded
together
in
the
North
of
England
;
some
,
in
Scotland
;
some
,
in
the
thick
woods
and
marshes
;
and
whensoever
they
could
fall
upon
the
Normans
,
or
upon
the
English
who
had
submitted
to
the
Normans
,
they
fought
,
despoiled
,
and
murdered
,
like
the
desperate
outlaws
that
they
were
.
 
<EOS>
Conspiracies
were
set
on
foot
for
a
general
massacre
of
the
Normans
,
like
the
old
massacre
of
the
Danes
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
English
were
in
a
murderous
mood
all
through
the
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
King
William
,
fearing
he
might
lose
his
conquest
,
came
back
,
and
tried
to
pacify
the
London
people
by
soft
words
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
set
forth
to
repress
the
country
people
by
stern
deeds
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
towns
which
he
besieged
,
and
where
he
killed
and
maimed
the
inhabitants
without
any
distinction
,
sparing
none
,
young
or
old
,
armed
or
unarmed
,
were
Oxford
,
Warwick
,
Leicester
,
Nottingham
,
Derby
,
Lincoln
,
York
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
these
places
,
and
in
many
others
,
fire
and
sword
worked
their
utmost
horrors
,
and
made
the
land
dreadful
to
behold
.
 
<EOS>
The
streams
and
rivers
were
discoloured
with
blood
;
the
sky
was
blackened
with
smoke
;
the
fields
were
wastes
of
ashes
;
the
waysides
were
heaped
up
with
dead
.
 
<EOS>
Such
are
the
fatal
results
of
conquest
and
ambition
!
 
<EOS>
Although
William
was
a
harsh
and
angry
man
,
I
do
not
suppose
that
he
deliberately
meant
to
work
this
shocking
ruin
,
when
he
invaded
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
what
he
had
got
by
the
strong
hand
,
he
could
only
keep
by
the
strong
hand
,
and
in
so
doing
he
made
England
a
great
grave
.
  
<EOS>
Two
sons
of
Harold
,
by
name
EDMUND
and
GODWIN
,
came
over
from
Ireland
,
with
some
ships
,
against
the
Normans
,
but
were
defeated
.
<EOS>
This
was
scarcely
done
,
when
the
outlaws
in
the
woods
so
harassed
York
,
that
the
Governor
sent
to
the
King
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
despatched
a
general
and
a
large
force
to
occupy
the
town
of
Durham
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
that
place
met
the
general
outside
the
town
,
and
warned
him
not
to
enter
,
as
he
would
be
in
danger
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
general
cared
nothing
for
the
warning
,
and
went
in
with
all
his
men
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
,
on
every
hill
within
sight
of
Durham
,
signal
fires
were
seen
to
blaze
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
morning
dawned
,
the
English
,
who
had
assembled
in
great
strength
,
forced
the
gates
,
rushed
into
the
town
,
and
slew
the
Normans
every
one
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
afterwards
besought
the
Danes
to
come
and
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
Danes
came
,
with
two
hundred
and
forty
ships
.
 
<EOS>
The
outlawed
nobles
joined
them
;
they
captured
York
,
and
drove
the
Normans
out
of
that
city
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
William
bribed
the
Danes
to
go
away
;
and
took
such
vengeance
on
the
English
,
that
all
the
former
fire
and
sword
,
smoke
and
ashes
,
death
and
ruin
,
were
nothing
compared
with
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
melancholy
songs
,
and
doleful
stories
,
it
was
still
sung
and
told
by
cottage
fires
on
winter
evenings
,
<EOS>
a
hundred
years
afterwards
,
how
,
in
those
dreadful
days
of
the
Normans
,
there
was
not
,
from
the
River
Humber
to
the
River
Tyne
,
one
inhabited
village
left
,
nor
one
cultivated
field
---
<EOS>
how
there
was
nothing
but
a
dismal
ruin
,
where
the
human
creatures
and
the
beasts
lay
dead
together
.
  
<EOS>
The
outlaws
had
,
at
this
time
,
what
they
called
a
Camp
of
Refuge
,
in
the
midst
of
the
fens
of
Cambridgeshire
.
 
<EOS>
Protected
by
those
marshy
grounds
which
were
difficult
of
approach
,
they
lay
among
the
reeds
and
rushes
,
and
were
hidden
by
the
mists
that
rose
up
from
the
watery
earth
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
there
also
was
,
at
that
time
,
over
the
sea
in
Flanders
,
an
Englishman
named
HEREWARD
,
whose
father
had
died
in
his
absence
,
and
whose
property
had
been
given
to
a
Norman
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
heard
of
this
wrong
that
had
been
done
him
(
from
such
of
the
exiled
English
as
chanced
to
wander
into
that
country
)
,
he
longed
for
revenge
;
and
joining
the
outlaws
in
their
camp
of
refuge
,
became
their
commander
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
good
a
soldier
,
that
the
Normans
supposed
him
to
be
aided
by
enchantment
.
 
<EOS>
William
,
even
after
he
had
made
a
road
three
miles
in
length
across
the
Cambridgeshire
marshes
,
on
purpose
to
attack
this
supposed
enchanter
,
thought
it
necessary
to
engage
an
old
lady
,
who
pretended
to
be
a
sorceress
,
to
come
and
do
a
little
enchantment
in
the
royal
cause
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
she
was
pushed
on
before
the
troops
in
a
wooden
tower
;
but
Hereward
very
soon
disposed
of
this
unfortunate
sorceress
,
by
burning
her
,
tower
and
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
monks
of
the
convent
of
Ely
near
at
hand
,
however
,
who
were
fond
of
good
living
,
and
who
found
it
very
uncomfortable
to
have
the
country
blockaded
and
their
supplies
of
meat
and
drink
cut
off
,
showed
the
King
a
secret
way
of
surprising
the
camp
.
 
<EOS>
So
Hereward
was
soon
defeated
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
afterwards
died
quietly
,
or
whether
he
was
killed
after
killing
sixteen
of
the
men
who
attacked
him
(
as
some
old
rhymes
relate
that
he
did
)
,
I
can
not
say
.
 
<EOS>
His
defeat
put
an
end
to
the
Camp
of
Refuge
;
and
,
very
soon
afterwards
,
the
King
,
victorious
both
in
Scotland
and
in
England
,
quelled
the
last
rebellious
English
noble
.
<EOS>
He
then
surrounded
himself
with
Norman
lords
,
enriched
by
the
property
of
English
nobles
;
had
a
great
survey
made
of
all
the
land
in
England
,
which
was
entered
as
the
property
of
its
new
owners
,
on
a
roll
called
Doomsday
Book
;
obliged
the
people
to
put
out
their
fires
and
candles
at
a
certain
hour
every
night
,
on
the
ringing
of
a
bell
which
was
called
The
Curfew
;
introduced
the
Norman
dresses
and
manners
;
made
the
Normans
masters
everywhere
,
and
the
English
,
servants
;
turned
out
the
English
bishops
,
and
put
Normans
in
their
places
;
and
showed
himself
to
be
the
Conqueror
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
even
with
his
own
Normans
,
he
had
a
restless
life
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
always
hungering
and
thirsting
for
the
riches
of
the
English
;
and
the
more
he
gave
,
the
more
they
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
His
priests
were
as
greedy
as
his
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
We
know
of
only
one
Norman
who
plainly
told
his
master
,
the
King
,
that
he
had
come
with
him
to
England
to
do
his
duty
as
a
faithful
servant
,
and
that
property
taken
by
force
from
other
men
had
no
charms
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
GUILBERT
.
 
<EOS>
We
should
not
forget
his
name
,
for
it
is
good
to
remember
and
to
honour
honest
men
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
all
these
troubles
,
William
the
Conqueror
was
troubled
by
quarrels
among
his
sons
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
three
living
.
 
<EOS>
ROBERT
,
called
CURTHOSE
,
because
of
his
short
legs
;
WILLIAM
,
called
RUFUS
or
the
Red
,
from
the
colour
of
his
hair
;
and
HENRY
,
fond
of
learning
,
and
called
,
in
the
Norman
language
,
BEAUCLERC
,
or
Fine
-
Scholar
.
 
<EOS>
When
Robert
grew
up
,
he
asked
of
his
father
the
government
of
Normandy
,
which
he
had
nominally
possessed
,
as
a
child
,
under
his
mother
,
MATILDA
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
refusing
to
grant
it
,
Robert
became
jealous
and
discontented
;
and
happening
one
day
,
while
in
this
temper
,
to
be
ridiculed
by
his
brothers
,
who
threw
water
on
him
from
a
balcony
as
he
was
walking
before
the
door
,
he
drew
his
sword
,
rushed
upstairs
,
and
was
only
prevented
by
the
King
himself
from
putting
them
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
,
he
hotly
departed
with
some
followers
from
his
father
's
court
,
and
endeavoured
to
take
the
Castle
of
Rouen
by
surprise
.
 
<EOS>
Failing
in
this
,
he
shut
himself
up
in
another
Castle
in
Normandy
,
which
the
King
besieged
,
and
where
Robert
one
day
unhorsed
and
nearly
killed
him
without
knowing
who
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
His
submission
when
he
discovered
his
father
,
and
the
intercession
of
the
queen
and
others
,
reconciled
them
;
but
not
soundly
;
for
Robert
soon
strayed
abroad
,
and
went
from
court
to
court
with
his
complaints
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
gay
,
careless
,
thoughtless
fellow
,
spending
all
he
got
on
musicians
and
dancers
;
but
his
mother
loved
him
,
and
often
,
against
the
King
's
command
,
supplied
him
with
money
through
a
messenger
named
SAMSON
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
incensed
King
swore
he
would
tear
out
Samson
's
eyes
;
and
Samson
,
thinking
that
his
only
hope
of
safety
was
in
becoming
a
monk
,
became
one
,
went
on
such
errands
no
more
,
and
kept
his
eyes
in
his
head
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
from
the
turbulent
day
of
his
strange
coronation
,
the
Conqueror
had
been
struggling
,
you
see
,
at
any
cost
of
cruelty
and
bloodshed
,
to
maintain
what
he
had
seized
.
 
<EOS>
All
his
reign
,
he
struggled
still
,
with
the
same
object
ever
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
stern
,
bold
man
,
and
he
succeeded
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
loved
money
,
and
was
particular
in
his
eating
,
but
he
had
only
leisure
to
indulge
one
other
passion
,
and
that
was
his
love
of
hunting
.
 
<EOS>
He
carried
it
to
such
a
height
that
he
ordered
whole
villages
and
towns
to
be
swept
away
to
make
forests
for
the
deer
.
<EOS>
Not
satisfied
with
sixty
-
eight
Royal
Forests
,
he
laid
waste
an
immense
district
,
to
form
another
in
Hampshire
,
called
the
New
Forest
.
 
<EOS>
The
many
thousands
of
miserable
peasants
who
saw
their
little
houses
pulled
down
,
and
themselves
and
children
turned
into
the
open
country
without
a
shelter
,
detested
him
for
his
merciless
addition
to
their
many
sufferings
;
and
when
,
in
the
twenty
-
first
year
of
his
reign
(
which
proved
to
be
the
last
)
,
he
went
over
to
Rouen
<EOS>
,
England
was
as
full
of
hatred
against
him
,
as
if
every
leaf
on
every
tree
in
all
his
Royal
Forests
had
been
a
curse
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
New
Forest
,
his
son
Richard
(
for
he
had
four
sons
)
had
been
gored
to
death
by
a
Stag
;
and
the
people
said
that
this
so
cruelly
-
made
Forest
would
yet
be
fatal
to
others
of
the
Conqueror
's
race
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
engaged
in
a
dispute
with
the
King
of
France
about
some
territory
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
stayed
at
Rouen
,
negotiating
with
that
King
,
he
kept
his
bed
and
took
medicines
:
 
being
advised
by
his
physicians
to
do
so
,
on
account
of
having
grown
to
an
unwieldy
size
.
 
<EOS>
Word
being
brought
to
him
that
the
King
of
France
made
light
of
this
,
and
joked
about
it
<EOS>
,
he
swore
in
a
great
rage
that
he
should
rue
his
jests
.
 
<EOS>
He
assembled
his
army
,
marched
into
the
disputed
territory
,
burnt
---
his
old
way
!
<EOS>
---
the
vines
,
the
crops
,
and
fruit
,
and
set
the
town
of
Mantes
on
fire
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
an
evil
hour
;
for
,
as
he
rode
over
the
hot
ruins
,
his
horse
,
setting
his
hoofs
upon
some
burning
embers
,
started
,
threw
him
forward
against
the
pommel
of
the
saddle
,
and
gave
him
a
mortal
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
For
six
weeks
he
lay
dying
in
a
monastery
near
Rouen
,
and
then
made
his
will
,
giving
England
to
William
,
Normandy
to
Robert
,
and
five
thousand
pounds
to
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
his
violent
deeds
lay
heavy
on
his
mind
.
 
<EOS>
He
ordered
money
to
be
given
to
many
English
churches
and
monasteries
,
and
---
which
was
much
better
repentance
---
released
his
prisoners
of
state
,
some
of
whom
had
been
confined
in
his
dungeons
twenty
years
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
September
morning
,
and
the
sun
was
rising
,
when
the
King
was
awakened
from
slumber
by
the
sound
of
a
church
bell
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
bell
is
that
?
"
he
faintly
asked
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
him
it
was
the
bell
of
the
chapel
of
Saint
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
commend
my
soul
,
"
said
he
,
"
to
Mary
!
"
and
died
.
  
<EOS>
Think
of
his
name
,
The
Conqueror
,
and
then
consider
how
he
lay
in
death
!
 
<EOS>
The
moment
he
was
dead
,
his
physicians
,
priests
,
and
nobles
,
not
knowing
what
contest
for
the
throne
might
now
take
place
,
or
what
might
happen
in
it
,
hastened
away
,
each
man
for
himself
and
his
own
property
;
the
mercenary
servants
of
the
court
began
to
rob
and
plunder
;
the
body
of
the
King
,
in
the
indecent
strife
,
was
rolled
from
the
bed
,
and
lay
alone
,
for
hours
,
upon
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
O
Conqueror
,
of
whom
so
many
great
names
are
proud
now
,
of
whom
so
many
great
names
thought
nothing
then
,
it
were
better
to
have
conquered
one
true
heart
,
than
England
!
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
the
priests
came
creeping
in
with
prayers
and
candles
;
and
a
good
knight
,
named
HERLUIN
,
undertook
(
which
no
one
else
would
do
)
to
convey
the
body
to
Caen
,
in
Normandy
,
in
order
that
it
might
be
buried
in
St
Stephen
's
church
there
,
which
the
Conqueror
had
founded
.
 
<EOS>
But
fire
,
of
which
he
had
made
such
bad
use
in
his
life
,
seemed
to
follow
him
of
itself
in
death
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
conflagration
broke
out
in
the
town
when
the
body
was
placed
in
the
church
;
and
those
present
running
out
to
extinguish
the
flames
,
it
was
once
again
left
alone
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
even
buried
in
peace
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
about
to
be
let
down
,
in
its
Royal
robes
,
into
a
tomb
near
the
high
altar
,
in
presence
of
a
great
concourse
of
people
,
when
a
loud
voice
in
the
crowd
cried
out
,
"
This
ground
is
mine
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
it
,
stood
my
father
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
This
King
despoiled
me
of
both
ground
and
house
to
build
this
church
.
<EOS>
In
the
great
name
of
GOD
,
I
here
forbid
his
body
to
be
covered
with
the
earth
that
is
my
right
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
priests
and
bishops
present
,
knowing
the
speaker
's
right
,
and
knowing
that
the
King
had
often
denied
him
justice
,
paid
him
down
sixty
shillings
for
the
grave
.
<EOS>
Even
then
,
the
corpse
was
not
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
The
tomb
was
too
small
,
and
they
tried
to
force
it
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
broke
,
a
dreadful
smell
arose
,
the
people
hurried
out
into
the
air
,
and
,
for
the
third
time
,
it
was
left
alone
.
  
<EOS>
Where
were
the
Conqueror
's
three
sons
,
that
they
were
not
at
their
father
's
burial
?
 
<EOS>
Robert
was
lounging
among
minstrels
,
dancers
,
and
gamesters
,
in
France
or
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
was
carrying
his
five
thousand
pounds
safely
away
in
a
convenient
chest
he
had
got
made
.
<EOS>
William
the
Red
was
hurrying
to
England
,
to
lay
hands
upon
the
Royal
treasure
and
the
crown
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
William
the
Second
,
<EOS>
Called
Rufus
    
WILLIAM
<EOS>
THE
RED
,
in
breathless
haste
,
secured
the
three
great
forts
of
Dover
,
Pevensey
,
and
Hastings
,
and
made
with
hot
speed
for
Winchester
,
where
the
Royal
treasure
was
kept
.
 
<EOS>
The
treasurer
delivering
him
the
keys
,
he
found
that
it
amounted
to
sixty
thousand
pounds
in
silver
,
besides
gold
and
jewels
.
 
<EOS>
Possessed
of
this
wealth
,
he
soon
persuaded
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
to
crown
him
,
and
became
William
the
Second
,
King
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
Rufus
was
no
sooner
on
the
throne
,
than
he
ordered
into
prison
again
the
unhappy
state
captives
whom
his
father
had
set
free
,
and
directed
a
goldsmith
to
ornament
his
father
's
tomb
profusely
with
gold
and
silver
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
more
dutiful
in
him
to
have
attended
the
sick
Conqueror
when
he
was
dying
;
but
England
itself
,
like
this
Red
King
,
who
once
governed
it
,
has
sometimes
made
expensive
tombs
for
dead
men
whom
it
treated
shabbily
when
they
were
alive
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
's
brother
,
Robert
of
Normandy
,
seeming
quite
content
to
be
only
Duke
of
that
country
;
and
the
King
's
other
brother
,
Fine
-
Scholar
,
being
quiet
enough
with
his
five
thousand
pounds
in
a
chest
;
the
King
flattered
himself
,
we
may
suppose
,
with
the
hope
of
an
easy
reign
.
 
<EOS>
But
easy
reigns
were
difficult
to
have
in
those
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
turbulent
Bishop
ODO
(
who
had
blessed
the
Norman
army
at
the
Battle
of
Hastings
,
and
who
,
I
dare
say
,
took
all
the
credit
of
the
victory
to
himself
)
soon
began
,
in
concert
with
some
powerful
Norman
nobles
,
to
trouble
the
Red
King
.
  
<EOS>
The
truth
seems
to
be
that
this
bishop
and
his
friends
,
who
had
lands
in
England
and
lands
in
Normandy
,
wished
to
hold
both
under
one
Sovereign
;
and
greatly
preferred
a
thoughtless
good
-
natured
person
,
such
as
Robert
was
,
to
Rufus
;
who
,
though
far
from
being
an
amiable
man
in
any
respect
,
was
keen
,
and
not
to
be
imposed
upon
.
<EOS>
They
declared
in
Robert
's
favour
,
and
retired
to
their
castles
(
those
castles
were
very
troublesome
to
kings
)
in
a
sullen
humour
.
<EOS>
The
Red
King
,
seeing
the
Normans
thus
falling
from
him
,
revenged
himself
upon
them
by
appealing
to
the
English
;
to
whom
he
made
a
variety
of
promises
,
which
he
never
meant
to
perform
---
in
particular
,
promises
to
soften
the
cruelty
of
the
Forest
Laws
;
and
who
,
in
return
,
so
aided
him
with
their
valour
,
that
ODO
was
besieged
in
the
Castle
of
Rochester
,
and
forced
to
abandon
it
,
and
to
depart
from
England
for
ever
:
 
whereupon
the
other
rebellious
Norman
nobles
were
soon
reduced
and
scattered
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Red
King
went
over
to
Normandy
,
where
the
people
suffered
greatly
under
the
loose
rule
of
Duke
Robert
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
object
was
to
seize
upon
the
Duke
's
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
the
Duke
,
of
course
,
prepared
to
resist
;
and
miserable
war
between
the
two
brothers
seemed
inevitable
,
when
the
powerful
nobles
on
both
sides
,
who
had
seen
so
much
of
war
,
interfered
to
prevent
it
.
 
<EOS>
A
treaty
was
made
.
<EOS>
Each
of
the
two
brothers
agreed
to
give
up
something
of
his
claims
,
and
that
the
longer
-
liver
of
the
two
should
inherit
all
the
dominions
of
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
had
come
to
this
loving
understanding
,
they
embraced
and
joined
their
forces
against
Fine
-
Scholar
;
who
had
bought
some
territory
of
Robert
with
a
part
of
his
five
thousand
pounds
,
and
was
considered

St
Michael
's
Mount
,
in
Normandy
(
there
is
another
St
Michael
's
Mount
,
in
Cornwall
,
wonderfully
like
it
)
<EOS>
,
was
then
,
as
it
is
now
,
a
strong
place
perched
upon
the
top
of
a
high
rock
,
around
which
,
when
the
tide
is
in
,
the
sea
flows
,
leaving
no
road
to
the
mainland
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
place
,
Fine
-
Scholar
shut
himself
up
with
his
soldiers
,
and
here
he
was
closely
besieged
by
his
two
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
when
he
was
reduced
to
great
distress
for
want
of
water
,
the
generous
Robert
not
only
permitted
his
men
to
get
water
,
but
sent
Fine
-
Scholar
wine
from
his
own
table
;
and
,
on
being
remonstrated
with
by
the
Red
King
,
said
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
shall
we
let
our
own
brother
die
of
thirst
?
 
<EOS>
Where
shall
we
get
another
,
when
he
is
gone
?
"
 
<EOS>
At
another
time
,
the
Red
King
riding
alone
on
the
shore
of
the
bay
,
looking
up
at
the
Castle
,
was
taken
by
two
of
Fine
-
Scholar
's
men
,
one
of
whom
was
about
to
kill
him
,
when
he
cried
out
,
"
Hold
,
knave
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
the
King
of
England
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
story
says
that
the
soldier
raised
him
from
the
ground
respectfully
and
humbly
,
and
that
the
King
took
him
into
his
service
.
 
<EOS>
The
story
may
or
may
not
be
true
;
but
at
any
rate
it
is
true
that
Fine
-
Scholar
could
not
hold
out
against
his
united
brothers
,
and
that
he
abandoned
Mount
St
Michael
,
and
wandered
about
---
as
poor
and
forlorn
as
other
scholars
have
been
sometimes
known
to
be
.
  
<EOS>
The
Scotch
became
unquiet
in
the
Red
King
's
time
,
and
were
twice
defeated
---
the
second
time
,
with
the
loss
of
their
King
,
Malcolm
,
and
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
The
Welsh
became
unquiet
too
.
 
<EOS>
Against
them
,
Rufus
was
less
successful
;
for
they
fought
among
their
native
mountains
,
and
did
great
execution
on
the
King
's
troops
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
of
Normandy
became
unquiet
too
;
and
,
complaining
that
his
brother
the
King
did
not
faithfully
perform
his
part
of
their
agreement
,
took
up
arms
,
and
obtained
assistance
from
the
King
of
France
,
whom
Rufus
,
in
the
end
,
bought
off
with
vast
sums
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
England
became
unquiet
too
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Mowbray
,
the
powerful
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
headed
a
great
conspiracy
to
depose
the
King
,
and
to
place
upon
the
throne
,
STEPHEN
,
the
Conqueror
's
near
relative
.
 
<EOS>
The
plot
was
discovered
;
all
the
chief
conspirators
were
seized
;
some
were
fined
,
some
were
put
in
prison
,
some
were
put
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Northumberland
himself
was
shut
up
in
a
dungeon
beneath
Windsor
Castle
,
where
he
died
,
an
old
man
,
thirty
long
years
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
Priests
in
England
were
more
unquiet
than
any
other
class
or
power
;
for
the
Red
King
treated
them
with
such
small
ceremony
that
he
refused
to
appoint
new
bishops
or
archbishops
when
the
old
ones
died
,
but
kept
all
the
wealth
belonging
to
those
offices
in
his
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
In
return
for
this
,
the
Priests
wrote
his
life
when
he
was
dead
,
and
abused
him
well
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
inclined
to
think
,
myself
,
that
there
was
little
to
choose
between
the
Priests
and
the
Red
King
;
that
both
sides
were
greedy
and
designing
;
and
that
they
were
fairly
matched
.
  
<EOS>
The
Red
King
was
false
of
heart
,
selfish
,
covetous
,
and
mean
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
worthy
minister
in
his
favourite
,
Ralph
,
nicknamed
---
for
almost
every
famous
person
had
a
nickname
in
those
rough
days
---
<EOS>
Flambard
,
or
the
Firebrand
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
the
King
being
ill
,
became
penitent
,
and
made
ANSELM
,
a
foreign
priest
and
a
good
man
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
no
sooner
got
well
again
than
he
repented
of
his
repentance
,
and
persisted
in
wrongfully
keeping
to
himself
some
of
the
wealth
belonging
to
the
archbishopric
.
 
<EOS>
This
led
to
violent
disputes
,
which
were
aggravated
by
there
being
in
Rome
at
that
time
two
rival
Popes
;
each
of
whom
declared
he
was
the
only
real
original
infallible
Pope
,
who
could
n't
make
a
mistake
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Anselm
,
knowing
the
Red
King
's
character
,
and
not
feeling
himself
safe
in
England
,
asked
leave
to
return
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
The
Red
King
gladly
gave
it
;
for
he
knew
that
as
soon
as
Anselm
was
gone
,
he
could
begin
to
store
up
all
the
Canterbury
money
again
,
for
his
own
use
.
  
<EOS>
By
such
means
,
and
by
taxing
and
oppressing
the
English
people
in
every
possible
way
,
the
Red
King
became
very
rich
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
wanted
money
for
any
purpose
,
he
raised
it
by
some
means
or
other
,
and
cared
nothing
for
the
injustice
he
did
,
or
the
misery
he
caused
.
<EOS>
Having
the
opportunity
of
buying
from
Robert
the
whole
duchy
of
Normandy
for
five
years
,
he
taxed
the
English
people
more
than
ever
,
and
made
the
very
convents
sell
their
plate
and
valuables
to
supply
him
with
the
means
to
make
the
purchase
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
as
quick
and
eager
in
putting
down
revolt
as
he
was
in
raising
money
;
for
,
a
part
of
the
Norman
people
objecting
---
very
naturally
,
I
think
---
to
being
sold
in
this
way
,
he
headed
an
army
against
them
with
all
the
speed
and
energy
of
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
impatient
,
that
he
embarked
for
Normandy
in
a
great
gale
of
wind
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
sailors
told
him
it
was
dangerous
to
go
to
sea
in
such
angry
weather
,
he
replied
,
"
Hoist
sail
and
away
!
 
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
hear
of
a
king
who
was
drowned
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
You
will
wonder
how
it
was
that
even
the
careless
Robert
came
to
sell
his
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
thus
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
long
been
the
custom
for
many
English
people
to
make
journeys
to
Jerusalem
,
which
were
called
pilgrimages
,
in
order
that
they
might
pray
beside
the
tomb
of
Our
Saviour
there
.
 
<EOS>
Jerusalem
belonging
to
the
Turks
,
and
the
Turks
hating
Christianity
,
these
Christian
travellers
were
often
insulted
and
ill
used
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pilgrims
bore
it
patiently
for
some
time
,
but
at
length
a
remarkable
man
,
of
great
earnestness
and
eloquence
,
called
PETER
THE
HERMIT
,
began
to
preach
in
various
places
against
the
Turks
,
and
to
declare
that
it
was
the
duty
of
good
Christians
to
drive
away
those
unbelievers
from
the
tomb
of
Our
Saviour
,
and
to
take
possession
of
it
,
and
protect
it
.
 
<EOS>
An
excitement
such
as
the
world
had
never
known
before
was
created
.
<EOS>
Thousands
and
thousands
of
men
of
all
ranks
and
conditions
departed
for
Jerusalem
to
make
war
against
the
Turks
.
 
<EOS>
The
war
is
called
in
history
the
first
Crusade
,
and
every
Crusader
wore
a
cross
marked
on
his
right
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
All
the
Crusaders
were
not
zealous
Christians
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
were
vast
numbers
of
the
restless
,
idle
,
profligate
,
and
adventurous
spirit
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
Some
became
Crusaders
for
the
love
of
change
;
some
,
in
the
hope
of
plunder
;
some
,
because
they
had
nothing
to
do
at
home
;
some
,
because
they
did
what
the
priests
told
them
;
some
,
because
they
liked
to
see
foreign
countries
;
some
,
because
they
were
fond
of
knocking
men
about
,
and
would
as
soon
knock
a
Turk
about
as
a
Christian
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
of
Normandy
may
have
been
influenced
by
all
these
motives
;
and
by
a
kind
desire
,
besides
,
to
save
the
Christian
Pilgrims
from
bad
treatment
in
future
.
 
<EOS>
He
wanted
to
raise
a
number
of
armed
men
,
and
to
go
to
the
Crusade
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
do
so
without
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
money
;
and
he
sold
his
dominions
to
his
brother
,
the
Red
King
,
for
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
large
sum
he
thus
obtained
,
he
fitted
out
his
Crusaders
gallantly
,
and
went
away
to
Jerusalem
in
martial
state
.
 
<EOS>
The
Red
King
,
who
made
money
out
of
everything
,
stayed
at
home
,
busily
squeezing
more
money
out
of
Normans
and
English
.
  
<EOS>
After
three
years
of
great
hardship
and
suffering
---
from
shipwreck
at
sea
;
from
travel
in
strange
lands
;
from
hunger
,
thirst
,
and
fever
,
upon
the
burning
sands
of
the
desert
;
and
from
the
fury
of
the
Turks
---
the
valiant
Crusaders
got
possession
of
Our
Saviour
's
tomb
.
 
<EOS>
The
Turks
were
still
resisting
and
fighting
bravely
,
but
this
success
increased
the
general
desire
in
Europe
to
join
the
Crusade
.
 
<EOS>
Another
great
French
Duke
was
proposing
to
sell
his
dominions
for
a
term
to
the
rich
Red
King
,
when
the
Red
King
's
reign
came
to
a
sudden
and
violent
end
.
  
<EOS>
You
have
not
forgotten
the
New
Forest
which
the
Conqueror
made
,
and
which
the
miserable
people
whose
homes
he
had
laid
waste
,
so
hated
.
<EOS>
The
cruelty
of
the
Forest
Laws
,
and
the
torture
and
death
they
brought
upon
the
peasantry
,
increased
this
hatred
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
persecuted
country
people
believed
that
the
New
Forest
was
enchanted
.
 
<EOS>
They
said
that
in
thunder
-
storms
,
and
on
dark
nights
,
demons
appeared
,
moving
beneath
the
branches
of
the
gloomy
trees
.
<EOS>
They
said
that
a
terrible
spectre
had
foretold
to
Norman
hunters
that
the
Red
King
should
be
punished
there
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
in
the
pleasant
season
of
May
,
when
the
Red
King
had
reigned
almost
thirteen
years
;
and
a
second
Prince
of
the
Conqueror
's
blood
---
another
Richard
,
the
son
of
Duke
Robert
---
was
killed
by
an
arrow
in
this
dreaded
Forest
;
the
people
said
that
the
second
time
was
not
the
last
,
and
that
there
was
another
death
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
lonely
forest
,
accursed
in
the
people
's
hearts
for
the
wicked
deeds
that
had
been
done
to
make
it
;
and
no
man
save
the
King
and
his
Courtiers
and
Huntsmen
,
liked
to
stray
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
reality
,
it
was
like
any
other
forest
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
spring
,
the
green
leaves
broke
out
of
the
buds
;
in
the
summer
,
flourished
heartily
,
and
made
deep
shades
;
in
the
winter
,
shrivelled
and
blew
down
,
and
lay
in
brown
heaps
on
the
moss
.
 
<EOS>
Some
trees
were
stately
,
and
grew
high
and
strong
;
some
had
fallen
of
themselves
;
some
were
felled
by
the
forester
's
axe
;
some
were
hollow
,
and
the
rabbits
burrowed
at
their
roots
;
some
few
were
struck
by
lightning
,
and
stood
white
and
bare
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
hill
-
sides
covered
with
rich
fern
,
on
which
the
morning
dew
so
beautifully
sparkled
;
there
were
brooks
,
where
the
deer
went
down
to
drink
,
or
over
which
the
whole
herd
bounded
,
flying
from
the
arrows
of
the
huntsmen
;
there
were
sunny
glades
,
and
solemn
places
where
but
little
light
came
through
the
rustling
leaves
.
 
<EOS>
The
songs
of
the
birds
in
the
New
Forest
were
pleasanter
to
hear
than
the
shouts
of
fighting
men
outside
;
and
even
when
the
Red
King
and
his
Court
came
hunting
through
its
solitudes
,
cursing
loud
and
riding
hard
,
with
a
jingling
of
stirrups
and
bridles
and
knives
and
daggers
,
they
did
much
less
harm
there
than
among
the
English
or
Normans
,
and
the
stags
died
(
as
they
lived
)
far
easier
than
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
a
day
in
August
,
the
Red
King
,
now
reconciled
to
his
brother
,
Fine
-
Scholar
,
came
with
a
great
train
to
hunt
in
the
New
Forest
.
<EOS>
Fine
-
Scholar
was
of
the
party
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
a
merry
party
,
and
had
lain
all
night
at
Malwood
-
Keep
,
a
hunting
-
lodge
in
the
forest
,
where
they
had
made
good
cheer
,
both
at
supper
and
breakfast
,
and
had
drunk
a
deal
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
The
party
dispersed
in
various
directions
,
as
the
custom
of
hunters
then
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
took
with
him
only
SIR
WALTER
TYRREL
,
who
was
a
famous
sportsman
,
and
to
whom
he
had
given
,
before
they
mounted
horse
that
morning
,
two
fine
arrows
.
  
<EOS>
The
last
time
the
King
was
ever
seen
alive
,
he
was
riding
with
Sir
Walter
Tyrrel
,
and
their
dogs
were
hunting
together
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
almost
night
,
when
a
poor
charcoal
-
burner
,
passing
through
the
forest
with
his
cart
,
came
upon
the
solitary
body
of
a
dead
man
,
shot
with
an
arrow
in
the
breast
,
and
still
bleeding
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
it
into
his
cart
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
body
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
Shaken
and
tumbled
,
with
its
red
beard
all
whitened
with
lime
and
clotted
with
blood
,
it
was
driven
in
the
cart
by
the
charcoal
-
burner
next
day
to
Winchester
Cathedral
,
where
it
was
received
and
buried
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Tyrrel
,
who
escaped
to
Normandy
,
and
claimed
the
protection
of
the
King
of
France
,
swore
in
France
that
the
Red
King
was
suddenly
shot
dead
by
an
arrow
from
an
unseen
hand
,
while
they
were
hunting
together
;
that
he
was
fearful
of
being
suspected
as
the
King
's
murderer
;
and
that
he
instantly
set
spurs
to
his
horse
,
and
fled
to
the
sea
-
shore
.
 
<EOS>
Others
declared
that
the
King
and
Sir
Walter
Tyrrel
were
hunting
in
company
,
a
little
before
sunset
,
standing
in
bushes
opposite
one
another
,
when
a
stag
came
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
King
drew
his
bow
and
took
aim
,
but
the
string
broke
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
King
then
cried
,
"
Shoot
,
Walter
,
in
the
Devil
's
name
!
"
 
<EOS>
That
Sir
Walter
shot
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
arrow
glanced
against
a
tree
,
was
turned
aside
from
the
stag
,
and
struck
the
King
from
his
horse
,
dead
.
  
<EOS>
By
whose
hand
the
Red
King
really
fell
,
and
whether
that
hand
despatched
the
arrow
to
his
breast
by
accident
or
by
design
,
is
only
known
to
GOD
.
 
<EOS>
Some
think
his
brother
may
have
caused
him
to
be
killed
;
but
the
Red
King
had
made
so
many
enemies
,
both
among
priests
and
people
,
that
suspicion
may
reasonably
rest
upon
a
less
unnatural
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
Men
know
no
more
than
that
he
was
found
dead
in
the
New
Forest
,
which
the
suffering
people
had
regarded
as
a
doomed
ground
for
his
race
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
<EOS>
the
First
,
Called
Fine
-
Scholar
    
FINE
-
SCHOLAR
,
on
hearing
of
the
Red
King
's
death
,
hurried
to
Winchester
with
as
much
speed
as
Rufus
himself
had
made
,
to
seize
the
Royal
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
keeper
of
the
treasure
who
had
been
one
of
the
hunting
-
party
in
the
Forest
,
made
haste
to
Winchester
too
,
and
,
arriving
there
at
about
the
same
time
,
refused
to
yield
it
up
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
Fine
-
Scholar
drew
his
sword
,
and
threatened
to
kill
the
treasurer
;
who
might
have
paid
for
his
fidelity
with
his
life
,
but
that
he
knew
longer
resistance
to
be
useless
when
he
found
the
Prince
supported
by
a
company
of
powerful
barons
,
who
declared
they
were
determined
to
make
him
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
treasurer
,
therefore
,
gave
up
the
money
and
jewels
of
the
Crown
:
 
and
on
the
third
day
after
the
death
of
the
Red
King
,
being
a
Sunday
,
Fine
-
Scholar
stood
before
the
high
altar
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
made
a
solemn
declaration
that
he
would
resign
the
Church
property
which
his
brother
had
seized
;
that
he
would
do
no
wrong
to
the
nobles
;
and
that
he
would
restore
to
the
people
the
laws
of
Edward
the
Confessor
,
with
all
the
improvements
of
William
the
Conqueror
.
 
<EOS>
So
began
the
reign
of
KING
HENRY
THE
FIRST
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
were
attached
to
their
new
King
,
both
because
he
had
known
distresses
,
and
because
he
was
an
Englishman
by
birth
and
not
a
Norman
.
 
<EOS>
To
strengthen
this
last
hold
upon
them
,
the
King
wished
to
marry
an
English
lady
;
and
could
think
of
no
other
wife
than
MAUD
THE
GOOD
,
the
daughter
of
the
King
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
Although
this
good
Princess
did
not
love
the
King
,
she
was
so
affected
by
the
representations
the
nobles
made
to
her
of
the
great
charity
it
would
be
in
her
to
unite
the
Norman
and
Saxon
races
,
and
prevent
hatred
and
bloodshed
between
them
for
the
future
,
that
she
consented
to
become
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
disputing
among
the
priests
,
who
said
that
as
she
had
been
in
a
convent
in
her
youth
,
and
had
worn
the
veil
of
a
nun
,
she
could
not
lawfully
be
married
---
against
which
the
Princess
stated
that
her
aunt
,
with
whom
she
had
lived
in
her
youth
,
had
indeed
sometimes
thrown
a
piece
of
black
stuff
over
her
,
but
for
no
other
reason
than
because
the
nun
's
veil
was
the
only
dress
the
conquering
Normans
respected
in
girl
or
woman
,
and
not
because
she
had
taken
the
vows
of
a
nun
,
which
she
never
had
---
she
was
declared
free
to
marry
,
and
was
made
King
Henry
's
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
A
good
Queen
<EOS>
she
was
;
beautiful
,
kind
-
hearted
,
and
worthy
of
a
better
husband
than
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
For
he
was
a
cunning
and
unscrupulous
man
,
though
firm
and
clever
.
<EOS>
He
cared
very
little
for
his
word
,
and
took
any
means
to
gain
his
ends
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
is
shown
in
his
treatment
of
his
brother
Robert
---
Robert
,
who
had
suffered
him
to
be
refreshed
with
water
,
and
who
had
sent
him
the
wine
from
his
own
table
,
when
he
was
shut
up
,
with
the
crows
flying
below
him
,
parched
with
thirst
,
in
the
castle
on
the
top
of
St
Michael
's
Mount
,
where
his
Red
brother
would
have
let
him
die
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
King
began
to
deal
with
Robert
,
he
removed
and
disgraced
all
the
favourites
of
the
late
King
;
who
were
for
the
most
part
base
characters
,
much
detested
by
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
Flambard
,
or
Firebrand
,
whom
the
late
King
had
made
Bishop
of
Durham
,
of
all
things
in
the
world
,
Henry
imprisoned
in
the
Tower
;
but
Firebrand
was
a
great
joker
and
a
jolly
companion
,
and
made
himself
so
popular
with
his
guards
that
they
pretended
to
know
nothing
about
a
long
rope
that
was
sent
into
his
prison
at
the
bottom
of
a
deep
flagon
of
wine
.
 
<EOS>
The
guards
took
the
wine
,
and
Firebrand
took
the
rope
;
with
which
,
when
they
were
fast
asleep
,
he
let
himself
down
from
a
window
in
the
night
,
and
so
got
cleverly
aboard
ship
and
away
to
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
Now
Robert
,
when
his
brother
Fine
-
Scholar
came
to
the
throne
,
was
still
absent
in
the
Holy
Land
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
pretended
that
Robert
had
been
made
Sovereign
of
that
country
;
and
he
had
been
away
so
long
,
that
the
ignorant
people
believed
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
behold
,
when
Henry
had
been
some
time
King
of
England
,
Robert
came
home
to
Normandy
;
having
leisurely
returned
from
Jerusalem
through
Italy
,
in
which
beautiful
country
he
had
enjoyed
himself
very
much
,
and
had
married
a
lady
as
beautiful
as
itself
!
 
<EOS>
In
Normandy
,
he
found
Firebrand
waiting
to
urge
him
to
assert
his
claim
to
the
English
crown
,
and
declare
war
against
King
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
after
great
loss
of
time
in
feasting
and
dancing
with
his
beautiful
Italian
wife
among
his
Norman
friends
,
he
at
last
did
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
in
general
were
on
King
Henry
's
side
,
though
many
of
the
Normans
were
on
Robert
's
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
English
sailors
deserted
the
King
,
and
took
a
great
part
of
the
English
fleet
over
to
Normandy
;
so
that
Robert
came
to
invade
this
country
in
no
foreign
vessels
,
but
in
English
ships
.
 
<EOS>
The
virtuous
Anselm
,
however
,
whom
Henry
had
invited
back
from
abroad
,
and
made
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
was
steadfast
in
the
King
's
cause
;
and
it
was
so
well
supported
that
the
two
armies
,
instead
of
fighting
,
made
a
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Poor
Robert
,
who
trusted
anybody
and
everybody
,
readily
trusted
his
brother
,
the
King
;
and
agreed
to
go
home
and
receive
a
pension
from
England
,
on
condition
that
all
his
followers
were
fully
pardoned
.
 
<EOS>
This
<EOS>
the
King
very
faithfully
promised
,
but
Robert
was
no
sooner
gone
than
he
began
to
punish
them
.
  
<EOS>
Among
them
was
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
,
who
,
on
being
summoned
by
the
King
to
answer
to
five
-
and
-
forty
accusations
,
rode
away
to
one
of
his
strong
castles
,
shut
himself
up
therein
,
called
around
him
his
tenants
and
vassals
,
and
fought
for
his
liberty
,
but
was
defeated
and
banished
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
,
with
all
his
faults
,
was
so
true
to
his
word
,
that
when
he
first
heard
of
this
nobleman
having
risen
against
his
brother
,
he
laid
waste
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
's
estates
in
Normandy
,
to
show
the
King
that
he
would
favour
no
breach
of
their
treaty
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
on
better
information
,
afterwards
,
that
the
Earl
's
only
crime
was
having
been
his
friend
,
he
came
over
to
England
,
in
his
old
thoughtless
,
warm
-
hearted
way
,
to
intercede
with
the
King
,
and
remind
him
of
the
solemn
promise
to
pardon
all
his
followers
.
  
<EOS>
This
confidence
might
have
put
the
false
King
to
the
blush
,
but
it
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
Pretending
to
be
very
friendly
,
he
so
surrounded
his
brother
with
spies
and
traps
,
that
Robert
,
who
was
quite
in
his
power
,
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
renounce
his
pension
and
escape
while
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
Getting
home
to
Normandy
,
and
understanding
the
King
better
now
,
he
naturally
allied
himself
with
his
old
friend
the
Earl
of
Shrewsbury
,
who
had
still
thirty
castles
in
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
exactly
what
Henry
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
declared
that
Robert
had
broken
the
treaty
,
and
next
year
invaded
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
He
pretended
that
he
came
to
deliver
the
Normans
,
at
their
own
request
,
from
his
brother
's
misrule
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
reason
to
fear
that
his
misrule
was
bad
enough
;
for
his
beautiful
wife
had
died
,
leaving
him
with
an
infant
son
,
and
his
court
was
again
so
careless
,
dissipated
,
and
ill
-
regulated
,
that
it
was
said
he
sometimes
lay
in
bed
of
a
day
for
want
of
clothes
to
put
on
---
his
attendants
having
stolen
all
his
dresses
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
headed
his
army
like
a
brave
prince
and
a
gallant
soldier
,
though
he
had
the
misfortune
to
be
taken
prisoner
by
King
Henry
,
with
four
hundred
of
his
Knights
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
was
poor
harmless
Edgar
Atheling
,
who
loved
Robert
well
.
 
<EOS>
Edgar
was
not
important
enough
to
be
severe
with
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
afterwards
gave
him
a
small
pension
,
which
he
lived
upon
and
died
upon
,
in
peace
,
among
the
quiet
woods
and
fields
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
And
Robert
---
poor
,
kind
,
generous
,
wasteful
,
heedless
Robert
,
with
so
many
faults
,
and
yet
with
virtues
that
might
have
made
a
better
and
a
happier
man
---
what
was
the
end
of
him
?
 
<EOS>
If
the
King
had
had
the
magnanimity
to
say
with
a
kind
air
,
"
Brother
,
tell
me
,
before
these
noblemen
,
that
from
this
time
you
will
be
my
faithful
follower
and
friend
,
and
never
raise
your
hand
against
me
or
my
forces
more
!
"
<EOS>
he
might
have
trusted
Robert
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
was
not
a
magnanimous
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
sentenced
his
brother
to
be
confined
for
life
in
one
of
the
Royal
Castles
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
beginning
of
his
imprisonment
,
he
was
allowed
to
ride
out
,
guarded
;
but
he
one
day
broke
away
from
his
guard
and
galloped
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
evil
fortune
to
ride
into
a
swamp
,
where
his
horse
stuck
fast
and
he
was
taken
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
heard
of
it
he
ordered
him
to
be
blinded
,
which
was
done
by
putting
a
red
-
hot
metal
basin
on
his
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
And
so
,
in
darkness
and
in
prison
,
many
years
,
he
thought
of
all
his
past
life
,
of
the
time
he
had
wasted
,
of
the
treasure
he
had
squandered
,
of
the
opportunities
he
had
lost
,
of
the
youth
he
had
thrown
away
,
of
the
talents
he
had
neglected
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
on
fine
autumn
mornings
,
he
would
sit
and
think
of
the
old
hunting
parties
in
the
free
Forest
,
where
he
had
been
the
foremost
and
the
gayest
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
in
the
still
nights
,
he
would
wake
,
and
mourn
for
the
many
nights
that
had
stolen
past
him
at
the
gaming
-
table
;
sometimes
,
would
seem
to
hear
,
upon
the
melancholy
wind
,
the
old
songs
of
the
minstrels
;
sometimes
,
would
dream
,
in
his
blindness
,
of
the
light
and
glitter
of
the
Norman
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Many
and
many
a
time
,
he
groped
back
,
in
his
fancy
,
to
Jerusalem
,
where
he
had
fought
so
well
;
or
,
at
the
head
of
his
brave
companions
,
bowed
his
feathered
helmet
to
the
shouts
of
welcome
greeting
him
in
Italy
,
and
seemed
again
to
walk
among
the
sunny
vineyards
,
or
on
the
shore
of
the
blue
sea
,
with
his
lovely
wife
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
,
thinking
of
her
grave
,
and
of
his
fatherless
boy
,
he
would
stretch
out
his
solitary
arms
and
weep
.
  
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
day
,
there
lay
in
prison
,
dead
,
with
cruel
and
disfiguring
scars
upon
his
eyelids
,
bandaged
from
his
jailer
's
sight
,
but
on
which
the
eternal
Heavens
looked
down
,
a
worn
old
man
of
eighty
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
once
been
Robert
of
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
Pity
him
!
  
<EOS>
At
the
time
when
Robert
of
Normandy
was
taken
prisoner
by
his
brother
,
Robert
's
little
son
was
only
five
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
This
child
was
taken
,
too
,
and
carried
before
the
King
,
sobbing
and
crying
;
for
,
young
as
he
was
,
he
knew
he
had
good
reason
to
be
afraid
of
his
Royal
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
not
much
accustomed
to
pity
those
who
were
in
his
power
,
but
his
cold
heart
seemed
for
the
moment
to
soften
towards
the
boy
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
observed
to
make
a
great
effort
,
as
if
to
prevent
himself
from
being
cruel
,
and
ordered
the
child
to
be
taken
away
;
whereupon
a
certain
Baron
,
who
had
married
a
daughter
of
Duke
Robert
's
(
by
name
,
Helie
of
Saint
Saen
)
,
took
charge
of
him
,
tenderly
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
gentleness
did
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
Before
two
years
were
over
,
he
sent
messengers
to
this
lord
's
Castle
to
seize
the
child
and
bring
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
Baron
was
not
there
at
the
time
,
but
his
servants
were
faithful
,
and
carried
the
boy
off
in
his
sleep
and
hid
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Baron
came
home
,
and
was
told
what
the
King
had
done
,
he
took
the
child
abroad
,
and
,
leading
him
by
the
hand
,
went
from
King
to
King
and
from
Court
to
Court
,
relating
how
the
child
had
a
claim
to
the
throne
of
England
,
and
how
his
uncle
the
King
,
knowing
that
he
had
that
claim
,
would
have
murdered
him
,
perhaps
,
but
for
his
escape
.
  
<EOS>
The
youth
and
innocence
of
the
pretty
little
WILLIAM
FITZ
-
ROBERT
(
for
that
was
his
name
)
made
him
many
friends
at
that
time
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
became
a
young
man
,
the
King
of
France
,
uniting
with
the
French
Counts
of
Anjou
and
Flanders
,
supported
his
cause
against
the
King
of
England
,
and
took
many
of
the
King
's
towns
and
castles
in
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
King
Henry
,
artful
and
cunning
always

bribed

.
 
<EOS>
He
bought
off
the
Count
of
Anjou
,
by
promising
to
marry
his
eldest
son
,
also
named
WILLIAM
,
to
the
Count
's
daughter
;
and
indeed
the
whole
trust
of
this
King
's
life
was
in
such
bargains
,
and
he
believed
(
as
many
another
King
has
done
since
,
and
as
one
King
did
in
France
a
very
little
time
ago
)
that
every
man
's
truth
and
honour
can
be
bought
at
some
price
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
this
,
he
was
so
afraid
of
William
Fitz
-
Robert
and
his
friends
,
that
,
for
a
long
time
,
he
believed
his
life
to
be
in
danger
;
and
never
lay
down
to
sleep
,
even
in
his
palace
surrounded
by
his
guards
,
without
having
a
sword
and
buckler
at
his
bedside
.
  
<EOS>
To
strengthen
his
power
,
the
King
with
great
ceremony
betrothed
his
eldest
daughter
MATILDA
,
then
a
child
only
eight
years
old
,
to
be
the
wife
of
Henry
the
Fifth
,
the
Emperor
of
Germany
.
 
<EOS>
To
raise
her
marriage
-
portion
,
he
taxed
the
English
people
in
a
most
oppressive
manner
;
then
treated
them
to
a
great
procession
,
to
restore
their
good
humour
;
and
sent
Matilda
away
,
in
fine
state
,
with
the
German
ambassadors
,
to
be
educated
in
the
country
of
her
future
husband
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
his
Queen
,
Maud
the
Good
,
unhappily
died
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
thought
for
that
gentle
lady
,
that
the
only
hope
with
which
she
had
married
a
man
whom
she
had
never
loved
---
the
hope
of
reconciling
the
Norman
and
English
races
---
had
failed
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
very
time
of
her
death
,
Normandy
and
all
France
was
in
arms
against
England
;
for
,
so
soon
as
his
last
danger
was
over
,
King
Henry
had
been
false
to
all
the
French
powers
he
had
promised
,
bribed
,
and
bought
,
and
they
had
naturally
united
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
fighting
,
however
,
in
which
few
suffered
but
the
unhappy
common
people
(
who
always
suffered
,
whatsoever
was
the
matter
)
,
he
began
to
promise
,
bribe
,
and
buy
again
;
and
by
those
means
,
and
by
the
help
of
the
Pope
,
who
exerted
himself
to
save
more
bloodshed
,
and
by
solemnly
declaring
,
over
and
over
again
,
that
he
really
was
in
earnest
this
time
,
and
would
keep
his
word
,
the
King
made
peace
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
first
consequences
of
this
peace
was
,
that
the
King
went
over
to
Normandy
with
his
son
Prince
William
and
a
great
retinue
,
to
have
the
Prince
acknowledged
as
his
successor
by
the
Norman
Nobles
,
and
to
contract
the
promised
marriage
<EOS>
(
this
was
one
of
the
many
promises
the
King
had
broken
)
between
him
and
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Anjou
.
 
<EOS>
Both
these
things
were
triumphantly
done
,
with
great
show
and
rejoicing
;
and
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
November
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
twenty
,
the
whole
retinue
prepared
to
embark
at
the
Port
of
Barfleur
,
for
the
voyage
home
.
  
<EOS>
On
that
day
,
and
at
that
place
,
there
came
to
the
King
,
FitzStephen
,
a
sea
-
captain
,
and
said
:
  
"
My
liege
,
my
father
served
your
father
all
his
life
,
upon
the
sea
.
<EOS>
He
steered
the
ship
with
the
golden
boy
upon
the
prow
,
in
which
your
father
sailed
to
conquer
England
.
 
<EOS>
I
beseech
you
to
grant
me
the
same
office
.
 
<EOS>
I
have
a
fair
vessel
in
the
harbour
here
,
called
The
White
Ship
,
manned
by
fifty
sailors
of
renown
.
 
<EOS>
I
pray
you
,
Sire
,
to
let
your
servant
have
the
honour
of
steering
you
in
The
White
Ship
to
England
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
am
sorry
,
friend
,
"
replied
the
King
,
"
that
my
vessel
is
already
chosen
,
and
that
I
can
not
(
therefore
)
sail
with
the
son
of
the
man
who
served
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Prince
and
all
his
company
shall
go
along
with
you
,
in
the
fair
White
Ship
,
manned
by
the
fifty
sailors
of
renown
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
An
hour
or
two
afterwards
,
the
King
set
sail
in
the
vessel
he
had
chosen
,
accompanied
by
other
vessels
,
and
,
sailing
all
night
with
a
fair
and
gentle
wind
,
<EOS>
arrived
upon
the
coast
of
England
in
the
morning
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
was
yet
night
,
the
people
in
some
of
those
ships
heard
a
faint
wild
cry
come
over
the
sea
,
and
wondered
what
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
Prince
was
a
dissolute
,
debauched
young
man
of
eighteen
,
who
bore
no
love
to
the
English
,
and
had
declared
that
when
he
came
to
the
throne
he
would
yoke
them
to
the
plough
like
oxen
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
aboard
The
White
Ship
,
with
one
hundred
and
forty
youthful
Nobles
like
himself
,
among
whom
were
eighteen
noble
ladies
of
the
highest
rank
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
gay
company
,
with
their
servants
and
the
fifty
sailors
,
made
three
hundred
souls
aboard
the
fair
White
Ship
.
  
<EOS>
"
Give
three
casks
of
wine
,
Fitz
-
Stephen
,
"
said
the
Prince
,
"
to
the
fifty
sailors
of
renown
!
 
<EOS>
My
father
the
King
has
sailed
out
of
the
harbour
.
 
<EOS>
What
time
is
there
to
make
merry
here
,
and
yet
reach
England
with
the
rest
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Prince
!
<EOS>
"
said
Fitz
-
Stephen
,
"
before
morning
,
my
fifty
and
The
White
Ship
shall
overtake
the
swiftest
vessel
in
attendance
on
your
father
the
King
,
if
we
sail
at
midnight
!
"
  
<EOS>
Then
the
Prince
commanded
to
make
merry
;
and
the
sailors
drank
out
the
three
casks
of
wine
;
and
the
Prince
and
all
the
noble
company
danced
in
the
moonlight
on
the
deck
of
The
White
Ship
.
  
<EOS>
When
,
at
last
,
she
shot
out
of
the
harbour
of
Barfleur
,
there
was
not
a
sober
seaman
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
sails
were
all
set
,
and
the
oars
all
going
merrily
.
 
<EOS>
Fitz
-
Stephen
had
the
helm
.
 
<EOS>
The
gay
young
nobles
and
the
beautiful
ladies
,
wrapped
in
mantles
of
various
bright
colours
to
protect
them
from
the
cold
,
talked
,
laughed
,
and
sang
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
encouraged
the
fifty
sailors
to
row
harder
yet
,
for
the
honour
of
The
White
Ship
.
  
<EOS>
Crash
!
 
<EOS>
A
terrific
cry
broke
from
three
hundred
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
cry
the
people
in
the
distant
vessels
of
the
King
heard
faintly
on
the
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
White
Ship
had
struck
upon
a
rock
---
was
filling
---
going
down
!
  
<EOS>
Fitz
-
Stephen
hurried
the
Prince
into
a
boat
,
with
some
few
Nobles
.
<EOS>
"
Push
off
,
"
he
whispered
;
"
and
row
to
land
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
far
,
and
the
sea
is
smooth
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
us
must
die
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
as
they
rowed
away
,
fast
,
from
the
sinking
ship
,
the
Prince
heard
the
voice
of
his
sister
MARIE
,
the
Countess
of
Perche
,
calling
for
help
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
in
his
life
had
been
so
good
as
he
was
then
.
 
<EOS>
He
cried
in
an
agony
,
"
<EOS>
Row
back
at
any
risk
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
bear
to
leave
her
!
"
  
<EOS>
They
rowed
back
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
Prince
held
out
his
arms
to
catch
his
sister
,
such
numbers
leaped
in
,
that
the
boat
was
overset
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
same
instant
The
White
Ship
went
down
.
  
<EOS>
Only
two
men
floated
.
 
<EOS>
They
both
clung
to
the
main
yard
of
the
ship
,
which
had
broken
from
the
mast
,
and
now
supported
them
.
 
<EOS>
One
asked
the
other
who
he
was
?
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
"
I
am
a
nobleman
,
GODFREY
by
name
,
the
son
of
GILBERT
DE
L'AIGLE
.
 
<EOS>
And
you
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
BEROLD
,
a
poor
butcher
of
Rouen
,
"
was
the
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
they
said
together
,
"
Lord
be
merciful
to
us
both
!
"
and
tried
to
encourage
one
another
,
as
they
drifted
in
the
cold
benumbing
sea
on
that
unfortunate
November
night
.
  
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
another
man
came
swimming
towards
them
,
whom
they
knew
,
when
he
pushed
aside
his
long
wet
hair
,
to
be
Fitz
-
Stephen
.
 
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
Prince
?
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
Gone
!
<EOS>
Gone
!
"
<EOS>
the
two
cried
together
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Neither
he
,
nor
his
brother
,
nor
his
sister
,
nor
the
King
's
niece
,
nor
her
brother
,
nor
any
one
of
all
the
brave
three
hundred
,
noble
or
commoner
,
except
we
three
,
has
risen
above
the
water
!
"
<EOS>
FitzStephen
,
with
a
ghastly
face
,
cried
,
"
Woe
!
<EOS>
woe
,
to
me
!
"
and
sunk
to
the
bottom
.
  
<EOS>
The
other
two
clung
to
the
yard
for
some
hours
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
young
noble
said
faintly
,
"
I
am
exhausted
,
and
chilled
with
the
cold
,
and
can
hold
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Farewell
,
good
friend
!
 
<EOS>
God
preserve
you
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
dropped
and
sunk
;
and
of
all
the
brilliant
crowd
,
the
poor
Butcher
of
Rouen
alone
was
saved
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
some
fishermen
saw
him
floating
in
his
sheep
-
skin
coat
,
and
got
him
into
their
boat
---
the
sole
relater
of
the
dismal
tale
.
  
<EOS>
For
three
days
,
no
one
dared
to
carry
the
intelligence
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
sent
into
his
presence
a
little
boy
,
who
,
weeping
bitterly
,
and
kneeling
at
his
feet
,
told
him
that
The
White
Ship
was
lost
with
all
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
fell
to
the
ground
like
a
dead
man
,
and
never
,
never
afterwards
,
was
seen
to
smile
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
plotted
again
,
and
promised
again
,
and
bribed
and
bought
again
,
in
his
old
deceitful
way
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
son
to
succeed
him
,
after
all
his
pains
(
"
The
Prince
will
never
yoke
us
to
the
plough
,
now
!
"
said
the
English
people
)
,
he
took
a
second
wife
---
ADELAIS
or
ALICE
,
a
duke
's
daughter
,
and
the
Pope
's
niece
.
 
<EOS>
Having
no
more
children
,
however
,
he
proposed
to
the
Barons
to
swear
that
they
would
recognise
as
his
successor
,
his
daughter
Matilda
,
whom
,
as
she
was
now
a
widow
,
he
married
to
the
eldest
son
of
the
Count
of
Anjou
,
GEOFFREY
,
surnamed
PLANTAGENET
,
from
a
custom
he
had
of
wearing
a
sprig
of
flowering
broom
(
called
Genàt
in
French
)
in
his
cap
for
a
feather
.
 
<EOS>
As
one
false
man
usually
makes
many
,
and
as
a
false
King
,
in
particular
,
is
pretty
certain
to
make
a
false
Court
,
the
Barons
took
the
oath
about
the
succession
of
Matilda
(
and
her
children
after
her
)
,
twice
over
,
without
in
the
least
intending
to
keep
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
now
relieved
from
any
remaining
fears
of
William
Fitz
-
Robert
,
by
his
death
in
the
Monastery
of
St
Omer
,
in
France
,
at
twenty
-
six
years
old
,
of
a
pike
-
wound
in
the
hand
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
Matilda
gave
birth
to
three
sons
,
he
thought
the
succession
to
the
throne
secure
.
  
<EOS>
He
spent
most
of
the
latter
part
of
his
life
,
which
was
troubled
by
family
quarrels
,
in
Normandy
,
to
be
near
Matilda
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
reigned
upward
of
thirty
-
five
years
,
and
was
sixty
-
seven
years
old
,
he
died
of
an
indigestion
and
fever
,
brought
on
by
eating
,
when
he
was
far
from
well
,
of
a
fish
called
Lamprey
,
against
which
he
had
often
been
cautioned
by
his
physicians
.
 
<EOS>
His
remains
were
brought
over
to
Reading
Abbey
to
be
buried
.
  
<EOS>
You
may
perhaps
hear
the
cunning
and
promise
-
breaking
of
King
Henry
the
First
,
called
"
policy
"
by
some
people
,
and
"
diplomacy
"
by
others
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
of
these
fine
words
will
in
the
least
mean
that
it
was
true
;
and
nothing
that
is
not
true
can
possibly
be
good
.
  
<EOS>
His
greatest
merit
,
that
I
know
of
,
was
his
love
of
learning
---
I
should
have
given
him
greater
credit
even
for
that
,
if
it
had
been
strong
enough
to
induce
him
to
spare
the
eyes
of
a
certain
poet
he
once
took
prisoner
,
who
was
a
knight
besides
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
ordered
the
poet
's
eyes
to
be
torn
from
his
head
,
because
he
had
laughed
at
him
in
his
verses
;
and
the
poet
,
in
the
pain
of
that
torture
,
dashed
out
his
own
brains
against
his
prison
wall
.
 
<EOS>
King
Henry
the
First
was
avaricious
,
revengeful
,
and
so
false
,
that
I
suppose
a
man
never
lived
whose
word
was
less
to
be
relied
upon
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Matilda
and
Stephen
    
<EOS>
THE
King
was
no
sooner
dead
than
all
the
plans
and
schemes
he
had
laboured
at
so
long
,
and
lied
so
much
for
,
crumbled
away
like
a
hollow
heap
of
sand
.
 
<EOS>
STEPHEN
,
whom
he
had
never
mistrusted
or
suspected
,
started
up
to
claim
the
throne
.
  
<EOS>
Stephen
was
the
son
of
ADELA
,
the
Conqueror
's
daughter
,
married
to
the
Count
of
Blois
.
 
<EOS>
To
Stephen
,
and
to
his
brother
HENRY
,
the
late
King
had
been
liberal
;
making
Henry
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
and
finding
a
good
marriage
for
Stephen
,
and
much
enriching
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
prevent
Stephen
from
hastily
producing
a
false
witness
,
a
servant
of
the
late
King
,
to
swear
that
the
King
had
named
him
for
his
heir
upon
his
death
-
bed
.
 
<EOS>
On
this
evidence
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
crowned
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
King
,
so
suddenly
made
,
lost
not
a
moment
in
seizing
the
Royal
treasure
,
and
hiring
foreign
soldiers
with
some
of
it
to
protect
his
throne
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
dead
King
had
even
done
as
the
false
witness
said
,
he
would
have
had
small
right
to
will
away
the
English
people
,
like
so
many
sheep
or
oxen
,
without
their
consent
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
,
in
fact
,
bequeathed
all
his
territory
to
Matilda
;
who
,
supported
by
ROBERT
,
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
soon
began
to
dispute
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
powerful
barons
and
priests
took
her
side
;
some
took
Stephen
's
;
all
fortified
their
castles
;
and
again
the
miserable
English
people
were
involved
in
war
,
from
which
they
could
never
derive
advantage
whosoever
was
victorious
,
and
in
which
all
parties
plundered
,
tortured
,
starved
,
and
ruined
them
.
  
<EOS>
Five
years
had
passed
since
the
death
of
Henry
the
First
---
and
during
those
five
years
there
had
been
two
terrible
invasions
by
the
people
of
Scotland
under
their
King
,
David
,
who
was
at
last
defeated
with
all
his
army
---
when
Matilda
,
attended
by
her
brother
Robert
and
a
large
force
,
appeared
in
England
to
maintain
her
claim
.
 
<EOS>
A
battle
was
fought
between
her
troops
and
King
Stephen
's
at
Lincoln
;
in
which
the
King
himself
was
taken
prisoner
,
after
bravely
fighting
until
his
battle
-
axe
and
sword
were
broken
,
and
was
carried
into
strict
confinement
at
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
Matilda
then
submitted
herself
to
the
Priests
,
and
the
Priests
crowned
her
Queen
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
She
did
not
long
enjoy
this
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
of
London
had
a
great
affection
for
Stephen
;
many
of
the
Barons
considered
it
degrading
to
be
ruled
by
a
woman
;
and
the
Queen
's
temper
was
so
haughty
that
she
made
innumerable
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
of
London
revolted
;
and
,
in
alliance
with
the
troops
of
Stephen
,
besieged
her
at
Winchester
,
where
they
took
her
brother
Robert
prisoner
,
whom
,
as
her
best
soldier
and
chief
general
,
she
was
glad
to
exchange
for
Stephen
himself
,
who
thus
regained
his
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
long
war
went
on
afresh
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
she
was
pressed
so
hard
in
the
Castle
of
Oxford
,
in
the
winter
weather
when
the
snow
lay
thick
upon
the
ground
,
that
her
only
chance
of
escape
was
to
dress
herself
all
in
white
,
and
,
accompanied
by
no
more
than
three
faithful
Knights
,
dressed
in
like
manner
that
their
figures
might
not
be
seen
from
Stephen
's
camp
as
they
passed
over
the
snow
,
to
steal
away
on
foot
,
cross
the
frozen
Thames
,
walk
a
long
distance
,
and
at
last
gallop
away
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
she
did
,
but
to
no
great
purpose
then
;
for
her
brother
dying
while
the
struggle
was
yet
going
on
,
she
at
last
withdrew
to
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
In
two
or
three
years
after
her
withdrawal
her
cause
appeared
in
England
,
afresh
,
in
the
person
of
her
son
Henry
,
young
Plantagenet
,
who
,
at
only
eighteen
years
of
age
,
was
very
powerful
:
 
not
only
on
account
of
his
mother
having
resigned
all
Normandy
to
him
,
but
also
from
his
having
married
ELEANOR
,
the
divorced
wife
of
the
French
King
,
a
bad
woman
,
who
had
great
possessions
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
Louis
,
the
French
King
,
not
relishing
this
arrangement
,
helped
EUSTACE
,
King
Stephen
's
son
,
to
invade
Normandy
:
 
but
Henry
drove
their
united
forces
out
of
that
country
,
and
then
returned
here
,
to
assist
his
partisans
,
whom
the
King
was
then
besieging
at
Wallingford
upon
the
Thames
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
for
two
days
,
divided
only
by
the
river
,
the
two
armies
lay
encamped
opposite
to
one
another
---
on
the
eve
,
as
it
seemed
to
all
men
,
of
another
desperate
fight
,
when
the
EARL
OF
ARUNDEL
took
heart
and
said
"
that
it
was
not
reasonable
to
prolong
the
unspeakable
miseries
of
two
kingdoms
to
minister
to
the
ambition
of
two
princes
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Many
other
noblemen
repeating
and
supporting
this
when
it
was
once
uttered
,
Stephen
and
young
Plantagenet
went
down
,
each
to
his
own
bank
of
the
river
,
and
held
a
conversation
across
it
,
in
which
they
arranged
a
truce
;
very
much
to
the
dissatisfaction
of
Eustace
,
who
swaggered
away
with
some
followers
,
and
laid
violent
hands
on
the
Abbey
of
St
Edmund's
-
Bury
,
where
he
presently
died
mad
.
 
<EOS>
The
truce
led
to
a
solemn
council
at
Winchester
,
in
which
it
was
agreed
that
Stephen
should
retain
the
crown
,
on
condition
of
his
declaring
Henry
his
successor
;
that
WILLIAM
,
another
son
of
the
King
's
,
should
inherit
his
father
's
rightful
possessions
;
and
that
all
the
Crown
lands
which
Stephen
had
given
away
should
be
recalled
,
and
all
the
Castles
he
had
permitted
to
be
built
demolished
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
terminated
the
bitter
war
,
which
had
now
lasted
fifteen
years
,
and
had
again
laid
England
waste
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
next
year
STEPHEN
died
,
after
a
troubled
reign
of
nineteen
years
.
  
<EOS>
Although
King
Stephen
was
,
for
the
time
in
which
he
lived
,
a
humane
and
moderate
man
,
with
many
excellent
qualities
;
and
although
nothing
worse
is
known
of
him
than
his
usurpation
of
the
Crown
,
which
he
probably
excused
to
himself
by
the
consideration
that
King
Henry
the
First
was
a
usurper
too
---
which
was
no
excuse
at
all
;
the
people
of
England
suffered
more
in
these
dread
nineteen
years
,
than
at
any
former
period
even
of
their
suffering
history
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
division
of
the
nobility
between
the
two
rival
claimants
of
the
Crown
,
and
in
the
growth
of
what
is
called
the
Feudal
System
(
which
made
the
peasants
the
born
vassals
and
mere
slaves
of
the
Barons
)
,
every
Noble
had
his
strong
Castle
,
where
he
reigned
the
cruel
king
of
all
the
neighbouring
people
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
perpetrated
whatever
cruelties
he
chose
.
 
<EOS>
And
never
were
worse
cruelties
committed
upon
earth
than
in
wretched
England
in
those
nineteen
years
.
  
<EOS>
The
writers
who
were
living
then
describe
them
fearfully
.
 
<EOS>
They
say
that
the
castles
were
filled
with
devils
rather
than
with
men
;
that
the
peasants
,
men
and
women
,
were
put
into
dungeons
for
their
gold
and
silver
,
were
tortured
with
fire
and
smoke
,
were
hung
up
by
the
thumbs
,
were
hung
up
by
the
heels
with
great
weights
to
their
heads
,
were
torn
with
jagged
irons
,
killed
with
hunger
,
broken
to
death
in
narrow
chests
filled
with
sharp
-
pointed
stones
,
murdered
in
countless
fiendish
ways
.
 
<EOS>
In
England
there
was
no
corn
,
no
meat
,
no
cheese
,
no
butter
,
there
were
no
tilled
lands
,
no
harvests
.
<EOS>
Ashes
of
burnt
towns
,
and
dreary
wastes
,
were
all
that
the
traveller
,
fearful
of
the
robbers
who
prowled
abroad
at
all
hours
,
would
see
in
a
long
day
's
journey
;
and
from
sunrise
until
night
,
he
would
not
come
upon
a
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
clergy
sometimes
suffered
,
and
heavily
too
,
from
pillage
,
but
many
of
them
had
castles
of
their
own
,
and
fought
in
helmet
and
armour
like
the
barons
,
and
drew
lots
with
other
fighting
men
for
their
share
of
booty
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
(
or
Bishop
of
Rome
)
,
on
King
Stephen
's
resisting
his
ambition
,
laid
England
under
an
Interdict
at
one
period
of
this
reign
;
which
means
that
he
allowed
no
service
to
be
performed
in
the
churches
,
no
couples
to
be
married
,
no
bells
to
be
rung
,
no
dead
bodies
to
be
buried
.
 
<EOS>
Any
man
having
the
power
to
refuse
these
things
,
no
matter
whether
he
were
called
a
Pope
or
a
Poulterer
,
would
,
of
course
,
have
the
power
of
afflicting
numbers
of
innocent
people
.
 
<EOS>
That
nothing
might
be
wanting
to
the
miseries
of
King
Stephen
's
time
,
the
Pope
threw
in
this
contribution
to
the
public
store
---
not
very
like
the
widow
's
contribution
,
as
I
think
,
when
Our
Saviour
sat
in
Jerusalem
over
-
against
the
Treasury

Part
<EOS>
the
First
    
HENRY
PLANTAGENET
,
when
he
was
but
twenty
-
one
years
old
,
quietly
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
England
,
according
to
his
agreement
made
with
the
late
King
at
Winchester
.
 
<EOS>
Six
weeks
after
Stephen
's
death
,
he
and
his
Queen
,
Eleanor
,
were
crowned
in
that
city
;
into
which
they
rode
on
horseback
in
great
state
,
side
by
side
,
amidst
much
shouting
and
rejoicing
,
and
clashing
of
music
,
and
strewing
of
flowers
.
  
<EOS>
The
reign
of
King
Henry
the
Second
began
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
had
great
possessions
,
and
(
what
with
his
own
rights
,
and
what
with
those
of
his
wife
)
was
lord
of
one
-
third
part
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
of
vigour
,
ability
,
and
resolution
,
and
immediately
applied
himself
to
remove
some
of
the
evils
which
had
arisen
in
the
last
unhappy
reign
.
 
<EOS>
He
revoked
all
the
grants
of
land
that
had
been
hastily
made
,
on
either
side
,
during
the
late
struggles
;
he
obliged
numbers
of
disorderly
soldiers
to
depart
from
England
;
he
reclaimed
all
the
castles
belonging
to
the
Crown
;
and
he
forced
the
wicked
nobles
to
pull
down
their
own
castles
,
to
the
number
of
eleven
hundred
,
in
which
such
dismal
cruelties
had
been
inflicted
on
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
brother
,
GEOFFREY
,
rose
against
him
in
France
,
while
he
was
so
well
employed
,
and
rendered
it
necessary
for
him
to
repair
to
that
country
;
where
,
after
he
had
subdued
and
made
a
friendly
arrangement
with
his
brother
(
who
did
not
live
long
)
,
his
ambition
to
increase
his
possessions
involved
him
in
a
war
with
the
French
King
,
Louis
,
with
whom
he
had
been
on
such
friendly
terms
just
before
,
that
to
the
French
King
's
infant
daughter
,
then
a
baby
in
the
cradle
,
he
had
promised
one
of
his
little
sons
in
marriage
,
who
was
a
child
of
five
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
war
came
to
nothing
at
last
,
and
the
Pope
made
the
two
Kings
friends
again
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
clergy
,
in
the
troubles
of
the
last
reign
,
had
gone
on
very
ill
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
all
kinds
of
criminals
among
them
---
murderers
,
thieves
,
and
vagabonds
;
and
the
worst
of
the
matter
was
,
that
the
good
priests
would
not
give
up
the
bad
priests
to
justice
,
when
they
committed
crimes
,
but
persisted
in
sheltering
and
defending
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
well
knowing
that
there
could
be
no
peace
or
rest
in
England
while
such
things
lasted
,
resolved
to
reduce
the
power
of
the
clergy
;
and
,
when
he
had
reigned
seven
years
,
found
(
as
he
considered
)
a
good
opportunity
for
doing
so
,
in
the
death
of
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
have
for
the
new
Archbishop
,
"
thought
the
King
,
"
a
friend
in
whom
I
can
trust
,
who
will
help
me
to
humble
these
rebellious
priests
,
and
to
have
them
dealt
with
,
when
they
do
wrong
,
as
other
men
who
do
wrong
are
dealt
with
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
resolved
to
make
his
favourite
,
the
new
Archbishop
;
and
this
favourite
was
so
extraordinary
a
man
,
and
his
story
is
so
curious
,
that
I
must
tell
you
all
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
Once
upon
a
time
,
a
worthy
merchant
of
London
,
named
GILBERT
A
BECKET
,
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Holy
Land
,
and
was
taken
prisoner
by
a
Saracen
lord
.
 
<EOS>
This
lord
,
who
treated
him
kindly
and
not
like
a
slave
,
had
one
fair
daughter
,
who
fell
in
love
with
the
merchant
;
and
who
told
him
that
she
wanted
to
become
a
Christian
,
and
was
willing
to
marry
him
if
they
could
fly
to
a
Christian
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
merchant
returned
her
love
,
until
he
found
an
opportunity
to
escape
,
when
he
did
not
trouble
himself
about
the
Saracen
lady
,
but
escaped
with
his
servant
Richard
,
who
had
been
taken
prisoner
along
with
him
,
and
arrived
in
England
and
forgot
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
Saracen
lady
,
who
was
more
loving
than
the
merchant
,
left
her
father
's
house
in
disguise
to
follow
him
,
and
made
her
way
,
under
many
hardships
,
to
the
sea
-
shore
.
 
<EOS>
The
merchant
had
taught
her
only
two
English
words
(
for
I
suppose
he
must
have
learnt
the
Saracen
tongue
himself
,
and
made
love
in
that
language
)
,
of
which
LONDON
was
one
,
and
his
own
name
,
GILBERT
,
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
among
the
ships
,
saying
,
"
London
!
<EOS>
London
!
"
<EOS>
over
and
over
again
,
until
the
sailors
understood
that
she
wanted
to
find
an
English
vessel
that
would
carry
her
there
;
so
they
showed
her
such
a
ship
,
and
she
paid
for
her
passage
with
some
of
her
jewels
,
and
sailed
away
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
 
<EOS>
The
merchant
was
sitting
in
his
counting
-
house
in
London
one
day
,
when
he
heard
a
great
noise
in
the
street
;
and
presently
Richard
came
running
in
from
the
warehouse
,
with
his
eyes
wide
open
and
his
breath
almost
gone
,
saying
,
"
Master
,
master
,
here
is
the
Saracen
lady
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
merchant
thought
Richard
was
mad
;
but
Richard
said
,
"
No
,
master
!
<EOS>
As
I
live
,
the
Saracen
lady
is
going
up
and
down
the
city
,
calling
Gilbert
!
 
<EOS>
Gilbert
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
took
the
merchant
by
the
sleeve
,
and
pointed
out
of
window
;
and
there
they
saw
her
among
the
gables
and
water
-
spouts
of
the
dark
,
dirty
street
,
in
her
foreign
dress
,
so
forlorn
,
surrounded
by
a
wondering
crowd
,
and
passing
slowly
along
,
calling
Gilbert
,
Gilbert
!
 
<EOS>
When
the
merchant
saw
her
,
and
thought
of
the
tenderness
she
had
shown
him
in
his
captivity
,
and
of
her
constancy
,
his
heart
was
moved
,
and
he
ran
down
into
the
street
;
and
she
saw
him
coming
,
and
with
a
great
cry
fainted
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
They
were
married
without
loss
of
time
,
and
Richard
(
who
was
an
excellent
man
)
danced
with
joy
the
whole
day
of
the
wedding
;
and
they
all
lived
happy
ever
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
This
merchant
and
this
Saracen
lady
had
one
son
,
THOMAS
A
BECKET
.
<EOS>
He
<EOS>
it
was
who
became
the
Favourite
of
King
Henry
the
Second
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
become
Chancellor
,
when
the
King
thought
of
making
him
Archbishop
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
clever
,
gay
,
well
educated
,
brave
;
had
fought
in
several
battles
in
France
;
had
defeated
a
French
knight
in
single
combat
,
and
brought
his
horse
away
as
a
token
of
the
victory
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
in
a
noble
palace
,
he
was
the
tutor
of
the
young
Prince
Henry
<EOS>
,
he
was
served
by
one
hundred
and
forty
knights
,
his
riches
were
immense
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
once
sent
him
as
his
ambassador
to
France
;
and
the
French
people
,
beholding
in
what
state
he
travelled
,
cried
out
in
the
streets
,
"
How
splendid
must
the
King
of
England
be
,
when
this
is
only
the
Chancellor
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
had
good
reason
to
wonder
at
the
magnificence
of
Thomas
a
Becket
,
for
,
when
he
entered
a
French
town
,
his
procession
was
headed
by
two
hundred
and
fifty
singing
boys
;
then
,
came
his
hounds
in
couples
;
then
,
eight
waggons
,
each
drawn
by
five
horses
driven
by
five
drivers
:
two
of
the
waggons
filled
with
strong
ale
to
be
given
away
to
the
people
;
four
,
with
his
gold
and
silver
plate
and
stately
clothes
;
two
,
with
the
dresses
of
his
numerous
servants
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
came
twelve
horses
,
each
with
a
monkey
on
his
back
;
then
,
a
train
of
people
bearing
shields
and
leading
fine
war
-
horses
splendidly
equipped
;
then
,
falconers
with
hawks
upon
their
wrists
;
then
,
a
host
of
knights
,
and
gentlemen
and
priests
;
then
,
the
Chancellor
with
his
brilliant
garments
flashing
in
the
sun
,
and
all
the
people
capering
and
shouting
with
delight
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
was
well
pleased
with
all
this
,
thinking
that
it
only
made
himself
the
more
magnificent
to
have
so
magnificent
a
favourite
;
but
he
sometimes
jested
with
the
Chancellor
upon
his
splendour
too
.
<EOS>
Once
,
when
they
were
riding
together
through
the
streets
of
London
in
hard
winter
weather
,
they
saw
a
shivering
old
man
in
rags
.
<EOS>
"
Look
at
the
poor
object
!
"
said
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
Would
it
not
be
a
charitable
act
to
give
that
aged
man
a
comfortable
warm
cloak
?
"
<EOS>
"
Undoubtedly
it
would
,
"
said
Thomas
a
Becket
,
"
and
<EOS>
you
do
well
<EOS>
,
Sir
,
to
think
of
such
Christian
duties
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Come
!
"
cried
the
King
,
"
then
give
him
your
cloak
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
made
of
rich
crimson
trimmed
with
ermine
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
tried
to
pull
it
off
,
the
Chancellor
tried
to
keep
it
on
,
both
were
near
rolling
from
their
saddles
in
the
mud
,
when
the
Chancellor
submitted
,
and
the
King
gave
the
cloak
to
the
old
beggar
:
 
much
to
the
beggar
's
astonishment
,
and
much
to
the
merriment
of
all
the
courtiers
in
attendance
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
courtiers
are
not
only
eager
to
laugh
when
the
King
laughs
,
but
they
really
do
enjoy
a
laugh
against
a
Favourite
.
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
,
"
thought
King
Henry
the
second
,
"
this
Chancellor
of
mine
,
Thomas
a
Becket
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
.
 
<EOS>
He
will
then
be
the
head
of
the
Church
,
and
,
being
devoted
to
me
,
will
help
me
to
correct
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
He
has
always
upheld
my
power
against
the
power
of
the
clergy
,
and
once
publicly
told
some
bishops
(
I
remember
)
,
that
men
of
the
Church
were
equally
bound
to
me
,
with
men
of
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
<EOS>
a
Becket
is
the
man
,
of
all
other
men
in
England
,
to
help
me
in
my
great
design
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
the
King
,
regardless
of
all
objection
,
either
that
he
was
a
fighting
man
,
or
a
lavish
man
,
or
a
courtly
man
,
or
a
man
of
pleasure
,
or
anything
but
a
likely
man
for
the
office
,
made
him
Archbishop
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Thomas
a
Becket
was
proud
and
loved
to
be
famous
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
already
famous
for
the
pomp
of
his
life
,
for
his
riches
,
his
gold
and
silver
plate
,
his
waggons
,
horses
,
and
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
do
no
more
in
that
way
than
he
had
done
;
and
being
tired
of
that
kind
of
fame
(
which
is
a
very
poor
one
)
<EOS>
,
he
longed
to
have
his
name
celebrated
for
something
else
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
,
he
knew
,
would
render
him
so
famous
in
the
world
,
as
the
setting
of
his
utmost
power
and
ability
against
the
utmost
power
and
ability
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
resolved
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
mind
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
He
may
have
had
some
secret
grudge
against
the
King
besides
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
may
have
offended
his
proud
humour
at
some
time
or
other
,
for
anything
I
know
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
it
likely
,
because
it
is
a
common
thing
for
Kings
,
Princes
,
and
other
great
people
,
to
try
the
tempers
of
their
favourites
rather
severely
.
 
<EOS>
Even
the
little
affair
of
the
crimson
cloak
must
have
been
anything
but
a
pleasant
one
to
a
haughty
man
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
knew
better
than
any
one
in
England
what
the
King
expected
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
his
sumptuous
life
,
he
had
never
yet
been
in
a
position
to
disappoint
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
take
up
that
proud
stand
now
,
as
head
of
the
Church
;
and
he
determined
that
it
should
be
written
in
history
,
either
that
he
subdued
the
King
,
or
that
the
King
subdued
him
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
of
a
sudden
,
he
completely
altered
the
whole
manner
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
turned
off
all
his
brilliant
followers
,
ate
coarse
food
,
drank
bitter
water
,
wore
next
his
skin
sackcloth
covered
with
dirt
and
vermin
<EOS>
(
for
it
was
then
thought
very
religious
to
be
very
dirty
)
,
flogged
his
back
to
punish
himself
,
lived
chiefly
in
a
little
cell
,
washed
the
feet
of
thirteen
poor
people
every
day
,
and
looked
as
miserable
as
he
possibly
could
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
put
twelve
hundred
monkeys
on
horseback
instead
of
twelve
,
and
had
gone
in
procession
with
eight
thousand
waggons
instead
of
eight
,
he
could
not
have
half
astonished
the
people
so
much
as
by
this
great
change
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
caused
him
to
be
more
talked
about
as
an
Archbishop
than
he
had
been
as
a
Chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
was
very
angry
;
and
was
made
still
more
so
,
when
the
new
Archbishop
,
claiming
various
estates
from
the
nobles
as
being
rightfully
Church
property
,
required
the
King
himself
,
for
the
same
reason
,
to
give
up
Rochester
Castle
,
and
Rochester
City
too
.
 
<EOS>
Not
satisfied
with
this
,
he
declared
that
no
power
but
himself
should
appoint
a
priest
to
any
Church
in
the
part
of
England
over
which
he
was
Archbishop
;
and
when
a
certain
gentleman
of
Kent
made
such
an
appointment
,
as
he
claimed
to
have
the
right
to
do
,
Thomas
a
Becket
excommunicated
him
.
  
<EOS>
Excommunication
was
,
next
to
the
Interdict
I
told
you
of
at
the
close
of
the
last
chapter
,
the
great
weapon
of
the
clergy
.
 
<EOS>
It
consisted
in
declaring
the
person
who
was
excommunicated
,
an
outcast
from
the
Church
and
from
all
religious
offices
;
and
in
cursing
him
all
over
,
from
the
top
of
his
head
to
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
whether
he
was
standing
up
,
lying
down
,
sitting
,
kneeling
,
walking
,
running
,
hopping
,
jumping
,
gaping
,
coughing
,
sneezing
,
or
whatever
else
he
was
doing
.
 
<EOS>
This
unchristian
nonsense
would
of
course
have
made
no
sort
of
difference
to
the
person
cursed
---
who
could
say
his
prayers
at
home
if
he
were
shut
out
of
church
,
and
whom
none
but
GOD
could
judge
---
but
for
the
fears
and
superstitions
of
the
people
,
who
avoided
excommunicated
persons
,
and
made
their
lives
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
King
said
to
the
New
Archbishop
,
"
Take
off
this
Excommunication
from
this
gentleman
of
Kent
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
which
the
Archbishop
replied
,
"
I
shall
do
no
such
thing
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
quarrel
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
A
priest
in
Worcestershire
committed
a
most
dreadful
murder
,
that
aroused
the
horror
of
the
whole
nation
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
demanded
to
have
this
wretch
delivered
up
,
to
be
tried
in
the
same
court
and
in
the
same
way
as
any
other
murderer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
refused
,
and
kept
him
in
the
Bishop
's
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
holding
a
solemn
assembly
in
Westminster
Hall
,
demanded
that
in
future
all
priests
found
guilty
before
their
Bishops
of
crimes
against
the
law
of
the
land
should
be
considered
priests
no
longer
,
and
should
be
delivered
over
to
the
law
of
the
land
for
punishment
.
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
again
refused
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
required
to
know
whether
the
clergy
would
obey
the
ancient
customs
of
the
country
?
 
<EOS>
Every
priest
there
,
but
one
,
said
,
after
Thomas
a
Becket
,
"
Saving
my
order
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
really
meant
that
they
would
only
obey
those
customs
when
they
did
not
interfere
with
their
own
claims
;
and
the
King
went
out
of
the
Hall
in
great
wrath
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
clergy
began
to
be
afraid
,
now
,
that
they
were
going
too
far
.
 
<EOS>
Though
Thomas
a
Becket
was
otherwise
as
unmoved
as
Westminster
Hall
,
they
prevailed
upon
him
,
for
the
sake
of
their
fears
,
to
go
to
the
King
at
Woodstock
,
and
promise
to
observe
the
ancient
customs
of
the
country
,
without
saying
anything
about
his
order
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
received
this
submission
favourably
,
and
summoned
a
great
council
of
the
clergy
to
meet
at
the
Castle
of
Clarendon
,
by
Salisbury
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
the
council
met
,
the
Archbishop
again
insisted
on
the
words
"
saying
my
order
;
"
and
he
still
insisted
,
though
lords
entreated
him
,
and
priests
wept
before
him
and
knelt
to
him
,
and
an
adjoining
room
was
thrown
open
,
filled
with
armed
soldiers
of
the
King
,
to
threaten
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
he
gave
way
,
for
that
time
,
and
the
ancient
customs
(
which
included
what
the
King
had
demanded
in
vain
)
were
stated
in
writing
,
and
were
signed
and
sealed
by
the
chief
of
the
clergy
,
and
were
called
the
Constitutions
of
Clarendon
.
  
<EOS>
The
quarrel
went
on
,
for
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
tried
to
see
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
would
not
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
tried
to
escape
from
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
sailors
on
the
coast
would
launch
no
boat
to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
again
resolved
to
do
his
worst
in
opposition
to
the
King
,
and
began
openly
to
set
the
ancient
customs
at
defiance
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
summoned
him
before
a
great
council
at
Northampton
,
where
he
accused
him
of
high
treason
,
and
made
a
claim
against
him
,
which
was
not
a
just
one
,
for
an
enormous
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
was
alone
against
the
whole
assembly
,
and
the
very
Bishops
advised
him
to
resign
his
office
and
abandon
his
contest
with
the
King
.
<EOS>
His
great
anxiety
and
agitation
stretched
him
on
a
sick
-
bed
for
two
days
,
but
he
was
still
undaunted
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
adjourned
council
,
carrying
a
great
cross
in
his
right
hand
,
and
sat
down
holding
it
erect
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
angrily
retired
into
an
inner
room
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
assembly
angrily
retired
and
left
him
there
.
<EOS>
But
there
he
sat
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishops
came
out
again
in
a
body
,
and
renounced
him
as
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
He
only
said
,
"
I
hear
!
"
and
sat
there
still
.
 
<EOS>
They
retired
again
into
the
inner
room
,
and
his
trial
proceeded
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
By
-
and
-
by
,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
heading
the
barons
,
came
out
to
read
his
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
He
refused
to
hear
it
,
denied
the
power
of
the
court
,
and
said
he
would
refer
his
cause
to
the
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
walked
out
of
the
hall
,
with
the
cross
in
his
hand
,
some
of
those
present
picked
up
rushes
---
rushes
were
strewn
upon
the
floors
in
those
days
by
way
of
carpet
---
and
threw
them
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
proudly
turned
his
head
,
and
said
that
were
he
not
Archbishop
,
he
would
chastise
those
cowards
with
the
sword
he
had
known
how
to
use
in
bygone
days
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
mounted
his
horse
,
and
rode
away
,
cheered
and
surrounded
by
the
common
people
,
to
whom
he
threw
open
his
house
that
night
and
gave
a
supper
,
supping
with
them
himself
.
 
<EOS>
That
same
night
he
secretly
departed
from
the
town
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
travelling
by
night
and
hiding
by
day
,
and
calling
himself
"
Brother
Dearman
,
"
got
away
,
not
without
difficulty
,
to
Flanders
.
  
<EOS>
The
struggle
still
went
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
angry
King
took
possession
of
the
revenues
of
the
archbishopric
,
and
banished
all
the
relations
and
servants
of
Thomas
a
Becket
,
to
the
number
of
four
hundred
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
and
the
French
King
both
protected
him
,
and
an
abbey
was
assigned
for
his
residence
.
 
<EOS>
Stimulated
by
this
support
,
Thomas
a
Becket
,
on
a
great
festival
day
,
formally
proceeded
to
a
great
church
crowded
with
people
,
and
going
up
into
the
pulpit
publicly
cursed
and
excommunicated
all
who
had
supported
the
Constitutions
of
Clarendon
:
 
mentioning
many
English
noblemen
by
name
,
and
not
distantly
hinting
at
the
King
of
England
himself
.
  
<EOS>
When
intelligence
of
this
new
affront
was
carried
to
the
King
in
his
chamber
,
his
passion
was
so
furious
that
he
tore
his
clothes
,
and
rolled
like
a
madman
on
his
bed
of
straw
and
rushes
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
soon
up
and
doing
.
 
<EOS>
He
ordered
all
the
ports
and
coasts
of
England
to
be
narrowly
watched
,
that
no
letters
of
Interdict
might
be
brought
into
the
kingdom
;
and
sent
messengers
and
bribes
to
the
Pope
's
palace
at
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
,
Thomas
a
Becket
,
for
his
part
,
was
not
idle
at
Rome
,
but
constantly
employed
his
utmost
arts
in
his
own
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
the
contest
stood
,
until
there
was
peace
between
France
and
England
(
which
had
been
for
some
time
at
war
)
,
and
until
the
two
children
of
the
two
Kings
were
married
in
celebration
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
French
King
brought
about
a
meeting
between
Henry
and
his
old
favourite
,
so
long
his
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
Even
then
,
though
Thomas
a
Becket
knelt
before
the
King
,
he
was
obstinate
and
immovable
as
to
those
words
about
his
order
.
 
<EOS>
King
Louis
of
France
was
weak
enough
in
his
veneration
for
Thomas
a
Becket
and
such
men
,
but
this
was
a
little
too
much
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
that
a
Becket
"
wanted
to
be
greater
than
the
saints
and
better
than
St
Peter
,
"
and
rode
away
from
him
with
the
King
of
England
.
<EOS>
His
poor
French
Majesty
asked
a
Becket
's
pardon
for
so
doing
,
however
,
soon
afterwards
,
and
cut
a
very
pitiful
figure
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
and
after
a
world
of
trouble
,
it
came
to
this
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
another
meeting
on
French
ground
between
King
Henry
and
Thomas
a
Becket
,
and
it
was
agreed
that
Thomas
a
Becket
should
be
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
according
to
the
customs
of
former
Archbishops
,
and
that
the
King
should
put
him
in
possession
of
the
revenues
of
that
post
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
indeed
,
you
might
suppose
the
struggle
at
an
end
,
and
Thomas
a
Becket
at
rest
.
 
<EOS>
NO
,
not
even
yet
.
 
<EOS>
For
Thomas
<EOS>
a
Becket
hearing
,
by
some
means
,
that
King
Henry
,
when
he
was
in
dread
of
his
kingdom
being
placed
under
an
interdict
,
had
had
his
eldest
son
Prince
Henry
secretly
crowned
,
not
only
persuaded
the
Pope
to
suspend
the
Archbishop
of
York
who
had
performed
that
ceremony
,
and
to
excommunicate
the
Bishops
who
had
assisted
at
it
,
but
sent
a
messenger
of
his
own
into
England
,
in
spite
of
all
the
King
's
precautions
along
the
coast
,
who
delivered
the
letters
of
excommunication
into
the
Bishops
"
own
hands
.
 
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
then
came
over
to
England
himself
,
after
an
absence
of
seven
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
privately
warned
that
it
was
dangerous
to
come
,
and
that
an
ireful
knight
,
named
RANULF
DE
BROC
,
had
threatened
that
he
should
not
live
to
eat
a
loaf
of
bread
in
England
;
but
he
came
.
  
<EOS>
The
common
people
received
him
well
,
and
marched
about
with
him
in
a
soldierly
way
,
armed
with
such
rustic
weapons
as
they
could
get
.
<EOS>
He
tried
to
see
the
young
prince
who
had
once
been
his
pupil
,
but
was
prevented
.
 
<EOS>
He
hoped
for
some
little
support
among
the
nobles
and
priests
,
but
found
none
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
the
most
of
the
peasants
who
attended
him
,
and
feasted
them
,
and
went
from
Canterbury
to
Harrow
-
on
-
the
-
Hill
,
and
from
Harrow
-
on
-
the
-
Hill
back
to
Canterbury
,
and
on
Christmas
Day
preached
in
the
Cathedral
there
,
and
told
the
people
in
his
sermon
that
he
had
come
to
die
among
them
,
and
that
it
was
likely
he
would
be
murdered
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
fear
,
however
---
<EOS>
or
,
if
he
had
any
,
he
had
much
more
obstinacy
---
for
he
,
then
and
there
,
excommunicated
three
of
his
enemies
,
of
whom
Ranulf
de
Broc
,
the
ireful
knight
,
was
one
.
  
<EOS>
As
men
in
general
had
no
fancy
for
being
cursed
,
in
their
sitting
and
walking
,
and
gaping
and
sneezing
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
,
it
was
very
natural
in
the
persons
so
freely
excommunicated
to
complain
to
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
equally
natural
in
the
King
,
who
had
hoped
that
this
troublesome
opponent
was
at
last
quieted
,
to
fall
into
a
mighty
rage
when
he
heard
of
these
new
affronts
;
and
,
on
the
Archbishop
of
York
telling
him
that
he
never
could
hope
for
rest
while
Thomas
a
Becket
lived
,
to
cry
out
hastily
before
his
court
,
"
Have
I
<EOS>
no
one
here
who
will
deliver
me
from
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
were
four
knights
present
,
who
,
hearing
the
King
's
words
,
looked
at
one
another
,
and
went
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
names
of
these
knights
were
REGINALD
FITZURSE
,
WILLIAM
TRACY
,
HUGH
DE
MORVILLE
,
and
RICHARD
BRITO
;
<EOS>
three
of
whom
had
been
in
the
train
of
Thomas
a
Becket
in
the
old
days
of
his
splendour
.
 
<EOS>
They
rode
away
on
horseback
,
in
a
very
secret
manner
,
and
on
the
third
day
after
Christmas
Day
arrived
at
Saltwood
House
,
not
far
from
Canterbury
,
which
belonged
to
the
family
of
Ranulf
de
Broc
.
 
<EOS>
They
quietly
collected
some
followers
here
,
in
case
they
should
need
any
;
and
proceeding
to
Canterbury
,
suddenly
appeared
(
the
four
knights
and
twelve
men
)
before
the
Archbishop
,
in
his
own
house
,
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
They
neither
bowed
nor
spoke
,
but
sat
down
on
the
floor
in
silence
,
staring
at
the
Archbishop
.
  
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
said
,
at
length
,
"
What
do
you
want
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
We
want
,
"
said
Reginald
Fitzurse
,
"
the
excommunication
taken
from
the
Bishops
,
and
you
to
answer
for
your
offences
to
the
King
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Thomas
a
Becket
defiantly
replied
,
that
the
power
of
the
clergy
was
above
the
power
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
That
it
was
not
for
such
men
as
they
were
,
to
threaten
him
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
he
were
threatened
by
all
the
swords
in
England
,
he
would
never
yield
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
we
will
do
more
than
threaten
!
"
said
the
knights
.
 
<EOS>
And
they
went
out
with
the
twelve
men
,
and
put
on
their
armour
,
and
drew
their
shining
swords
,
and
came
back
.
  
<EOS>
His
servants
,
in
the
meantime
,
had
shut
up
and
barred
the
great
gate
of
the
palace
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
knights
tried
to
shatter
it
with
their
battle
-
axes
;
but
,
being
shown
a
window
by
which
they
could
enter
,
they
let
the
gate
alone
,
and
climbed
in
that
way
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
battering
at
the
door
,
the
attendants
of
Thomas
a
Becket
had
implored
him
to
take
refuge
in
the
Cathedral
;
in
which
,
as
a
sanctuary
or
sacred
place
,
they
thought
the
knights
would
dare
to
do
no
violent
deed
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
them
,
again
and
again
,
that
he
would
not
stir
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
the
distant
voices
of
the
monks
singing
the
evening
service
,
however
,
he
said
it
was
now
his
duty
to
attend
,
and
therefore
,
and
for
no
other
reason
,
he
would
go
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
near
way
between
his
Palace
and
the
Cathedral
,
by
some
beautiful
old
cloisters
which
you
may
yet
see
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
into
the
Cathedral
,
without
any
hurry
,
and
having
the
Cross
carried
before
him
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
safely
there
,
his
servants
would
have
fastened
the
door
,
but
he
said
NO
!
<EOS>
it
was
the
house
of
God
and
not
a
fortress
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
spoke
,
the
shadow
of
Reginald
Fitzurse
appeared
in
the
Cathedral
doorway
,
darkening
the
little
light
there
was
outside
,
on
the
dark
winter
evening
.
 
<EOS>
This
knight
said
,
in
a
strong
voice
,
"
Follow
me
,
loyal
servants
of
the
King
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
rattle
of
the
armour
of
the
other
knights
echoed
through
the
Cathedral
,
as
they
came
clashing
in
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
so
dark
,
in
the
lofty
aisles
and
among
the
stately
pillars
of
the
church
,
and
there
were
so
many
hiding
-
places
in
the
crypt
below
and
in
the
narrow
passages
above
,
that
Thomas
a
Becket
might
even
at
that
pass
have
saved
himself
if
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
the
monks
resolutely
that
he
would
not
.
 
<EOS>
And
though
they
all
dispersed
and
left
him
there
with
no
other
follower
than
EDWARD
GRYME
,
his
faithful
cross
-
bearer
,
he
was
as
firm
then
,
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
.
  
<EOS>
The
knights
came
on
,
through
the
darkness
,
making
a
terrible
noise
with
their
armed
tread
upon
the
stone
pavement
of
the
church
.
<EOS>
"
Where
is
the
traitor
?
"
they
cried
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
they
cried
,
"
Where
is
the
Archbishop
?
<EOS>
"
he
said
proudly
,
"
I
am
here
!
"
and
came
out
of
the
shade
and
stood
before
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
knights
had
no
desire
to
kill
him
,
if
they
could
rid
the
King
and
themselves
of
him
by
any
other
means
.
 
<EOS>
They
told
him
he
must
either
fly
or
go
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
would
do
neither
;
and
he
threw
William
Tracy
off
with
such
force
when
he
took
hold
of
his
sleeve
,
that
Tracy
reeled
again
.
 
<EOS>
By
his
reproaches
and
his
steadiness
,
he
so
incensed
them
,
and
exasperated
their
fierce
humour
,
that
Reginald
Fitzurse
,
whom
he
called
by
an
ill
name
,
said
,
"
Then
die
!
"
and
struck
at
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
faithful
Edward
Gryme
put
out
his
arm
,
and
there
received
the
main
force
of
the
blow
,
so
that
it
only
made
his
master
bleed
.
 
<EOS>
Another
voice
from
among
the
knights
again
called
to
Thomas
a
Becket
to
fly
;
but
,
with
his
blood
running
down
his
face
,
and
his
hands
clasped
,
and
his
head
bent
,
he
commanded
himself
to
God
,
and
stood
firm
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
cruelly
killed
him
close
to
the
altar
of
St
Bennet
;
and
his
body
fell
upon
the
pavement
,
which
was
dirtied
with
his
blood
and
brains
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
an
awful
thing
to
think
of
the
murdered
mortal
,
who
had
so
showered
his
curses
about
,
lying
,
all
disfigured
,
in
the
church
,
where
a
few
lamps
here
and
there
were
but
red
specks
on
a
pall
of
darkness
;
and
to
think
of
the
guilty
knights
riding
away
on
horseback
,
looking
over
their
shoulders
at
the
dim
Cathedral
,
and
remembering
what
they
had
left
inside
.
  
<EOS>
Part
the
Second
    
<EOS>
WHEN
the
King
heard
how
Thomas
a
Becket
had
lost
his
life
in
Canterbury
Cathedral
,
through
the
ferocity
of
the
four
Knights
,
he
was
filled
with
dismay
.
 
<EOS>
Some
have
supposed
that
when
the
King
spoke
those
hasty
words
,
"
Have
I
no
one
here
who
will
deliver
me
from
this
man
?
<EOS>
"
he
wished
,
and
meant
a
Becket
to
be
slain
.
 
<EOS>
But
few
things
are
more
unlikely
;
for
,
besides
that
the
King
was
not
naturally
cruel
(
though
very
passionate
)
,
he
was
wise
,
and
must
have
known
full
well
what
any
stupid
man
in
his
dominions
must
have
known
,
namely
,
that
such
a
murder
would
rouse
the
Pope
and
the
whole
Church
against
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
sent
respectful
messengers
to
the
Pope
,
to
represent
his
innocence
(
except
in
having
uttered
the
hasty
words
)
;
and
he
swore
solemnly
and
publicly
to
his
innocence
,
and
contrived
in
time
to
make
his
peace
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
four
guilty
Knights
,
who
fled
into
Yorkshire
,
and
never
again
dared
to
show
themselves
at
Court
,
the
Pope
excommunicated
them
;
and
they
lived
miserably
for
some
time
,
shunned
by
all
their
countrymen
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
they
went
humbly
to
Jerusalem
as
a
penance
,
and
there
died
and
were
buried
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
,
fortunately
for
the
pacifying
of
the
Pope
,
that
an
opportunity
arose
very
soon
after
the
murder
of
a
Becket
,
for
the
King
to
declare
his
power
in
Ireland
---
which
was
an
acceptable
undertaking
to
the
Pope
,
as
the
Irish
,
who
had
been
converted
to
Christianity
by
one
Patricius
(
otherwise
Saint
Patrick
)
long
ago
,
before
any
Pope
existed
,
considered
that
the
Pope
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
them
,
or
they
with
the
Pope
,
and
accordingly
refused
to
pay
him
Peter
's
Pence
,
or
that
tax
of
a
penny
a
house
which
I
have
elsewhere
mentioned
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
opportunity
arose
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
Irish
were
,
at
that
time
,
as
barbarous
a
people
as
you
can
well
imagine
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
continually
quarrelling
and
fighting
,
cutting
one
another
's
throats
,
slicing
one
another
's
noses
,
burning
one
another
's
houses
,
carrying
away
one
another
's
wives
,
and
committing
all
sorts
of
violence
.
 
<EOS>
The
country
was
divided
into
five
kingdoms
---
DESMOND
,
THOMOND
,
CONNAUGHT
,
ULSTER
,
and
LEINSTER
---
each
governed
by
a
separate
King
,
of
whom
one
claimed
to
be
the
chief
of
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
one
of
these
Kings
,
named
DERMOND
MAC
MURROUGH
(
a
wild
kind
of
name
,
spelt
in
more
than
one
wild
kind
of
way
)
,
had
carried
off
the
wife
of
a
friend
of
his
,
and
concealed
her
on
an
island
in
a
bog
.
 
<EOS>
The
friend
resenting
this
(
though
it
was
quite
the
custom
of
the
country
)
,
complained
to
the
chief
King
,
and
,
with
the
chief
King
's
help
,
drove
Dermond
Mac
Murrough
out
of
his
dominions
.
<EOS>
Dermond
came
over
to
England
for
revenge
;
and
offered
to
hold
his
realm
as
a
vassal
of
King
Henry
,
if
King
Henry
would
help
him
to
regain
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
consented
to
these
terms
;
but
only
assisted
him
,
then
,
with
what
were
called
Letters
Patent
,
authorising
any
English
subjects
who
were
so
disposed
,
to
enter
into
his
service
,
and
aid
his
cause
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
at
Bristol
,
a
certain
EARL
RICHARD
DE
CLARE
,
called
STRONGBOW
;
of
no
very
good
character
;
needy
and
desperate
,
and
ready
for
anything
that
offered
him
a
chance
of
improving
his
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
,
in
South
Wales
,
two
other
broken
knights
of
the
same
good
-
for
-
nothing
sort
,
called
ROBERT
FITZ
-
STEPHEN
,
and
MAURICE
FITZ
-
GERALD
.
 
<EOS>
These
three
,
each
with
a
small
band
of
followers
,
took
up
Dermond
's
cause
;
and
it
was
agreed
that
if
it
proved
successful
,
Strongbow
should
marry
Dermond
's
daughter
EVA
,
and
be
declared
his
heir
.
  
<EOS>
The
trained
English
followers
of
these
knights
were
so
superior
in
all
the
discipline
of
battle
to
the
Irish
,
that
they
beat
them
against
immense
superiority
of
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
fight
,
early
in
the
war
,
they
cut
off
three
hundred
heads
,
and
laid
them
before
Mac
Murrough
;
who
turned
them
every
one
up
with
his
hands
,
rejoicing
,
and
,
coming
to
one
which
was
the
head
of
a
man
whom
he
had
much
disliked
,
grasped
it
by
the
hair
and
ears
,
and
tore
off
the
nose
and
lips
with
his
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
judge
from
this
,
what
kind
of
a
gentleman
an
Irish
King
in
those
times
was
.
 
<EOS>
The
captives
,
all
through
this
war
,
were
horribly
treated
;
the
victorious
party
making
nothing
of
breaking
their
limbs
,
and
casting
them
into
the
sea
from
the
tops
of
high
rocks
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
midst
of
the
miseries
and
cruelties
attendant
on
the
taking
of
Waterford
,
where
the
dead
lay
<EOS>
piled
in
the
streets
,
and
the
filthy
gutters
ran
with
blood
,
that
Strongbow
married
Eva
.
 
<EOS>
An
odious
marriage
-
company
those
mounds
of
corpse
's
must
have
made
,
I
think
,
and
one
quite
worthy
of
the
young
lady
's
father
.
  
<EOS>
He
died
,
after
Waterford
and
Dublin
had
been
taken
,
and
various
successes
achieved
;
and
Strongbow
became
King
of
Leinster
.
 
<EOS>
Now
came
King
Henry
's
opportunity
.
 
<EOS>
To
restrain
the
growing
power
of
Strongbow
,
he
himself
repaired
to
Dublin
,
as
Strongbow
's
Royal
Master
,
and
deprived
him
of
his
kingdom
,
but
confirmed
him
in
the
enjoyment
of
great
possessions
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
then
,
holding
state
in
Dublin
,
received
the
homage
of
nearly
all
the
Irish
Kings
and
Chiefs
,
and
so
came
home
again
with
a
great
addition
to
his
reputation
as
Lord
of
Ireland
,
and
with
a
new
claim
on
the
favour
of
the
Pope
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
their
reconciliation
was
completed
---
more
easily
and
mildly
by
the
Pope
,
than
the
King
might
have
expected
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
period
of
his
reign
,
when
his
troubles
seemed
so
few
and
his
prospects
so
bright
,
those
domestic
miseries
began
which
gradually
made
the
King
the
most
unhappy
of
men
,
reduced
his
great
spirit
,
wore
away
his
health
,
and
broke
his
heart
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
four
sons
.
 
<EOS>
HENRY
,
now
aged
eighteen
---
his
secret
crowning
of
whom
had
given
such
offence
to
Thomas
a
Becket
.
 
<EOS>
RICHARD
,
aged
sixteen
;
GEOFFREY
,
fifteen
;
and
JOHN
,
his
favourite
,
a
young
boy
whom
the
courtiers
named
LACKLAND
,
because
he
had
no
inheritance
,
but
to
whom
the
King
meant
to
give
the
Lordship
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
misguided
boys
,
in
their
turn
,
were
unnatural
sons
to
him
,
and
unnatural
brothers
to
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Henry
,
stimulated
by
the
French
King
,
and
by
his
bad
mother
,
Queen
Eleanor
,
began
the
undutiful
history
,
  
<EOS>
First
,
he
demanded
that
his
young
wife
,
MARGARET
,
the
French
King
's
daughter
,
should
be
crowned
as
well
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
,
the
King
,
consented
,
and
it
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
sooner
done
,
than
he
demanded
to
have
a
part
of
his
father
's
dominions
,
during
his
father
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
refused
,
he
made
off
from
his
father
in
the
night
,
with
his
bad
heart
full
of
bitterness
,
and
took
refuge
at
the
French
King
's
Court
.
 
<EOS>
Within
a
day
or
two
,
his
brothers
Richard
and
Geoffrey
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Their
mother
tried
to
join
them
---
escaping
in
man
's
clothes
---
but
she
was
seized
by
King
Henry
's
men
,
and
immured
in
prison
,
where
she
lay
,
deservedly
,
for
sixteen
years
.
 
<EOS>
Every
day
,
however
,
some
grasping
English
noblemen
,
to
whom
the
King
's
protection
of
his
people
from
their
avarice
and
oppression
had
given
offence
,
deserted
him
and
joined
the
Princes
.
<EOS>
Every
day
he
heard
some
fresh
intelligence
of
the
Princes
levying
armies
against
him
;
of
Prince
Henry
's
wearing
a
crown
before
his
own
ambassadors
at
the
French
Court
,
and
being
called
the
Junior
King
of
England
;
of
all
the
Princes
swearing
never
to
make
peace
with
him
,
their
father
,
without
the
consent
and
approval
of
the
Barons
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
with
his
fortitude
and
energy
unshaken
,
King
Henry
met
the
shock
of
these
disasters
with
a
resolved
and
cheerful
face
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
upon
all
Royal
fathers
who
had
sons
,
to
help
him
,
for
his
cause
was
theirs
;
he
hired
,
out
of
his
riches
,
twenty
thousand
men
to
fight
the
false
French
King
,
who
stirred
his
own
blood
against
him
;
and
he
carried
on
the
war
with
such
vigour
,
that
Louis
soon
proposed
a
conference
to
treat
for
peace
.
  
<EOS>
The
conference
was
held
beneath
an
old
wide
-
spreading
green
elm
-
tree
,
upon
a
plain
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
It
led
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
war
recommenced
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Richard
began
his
fighting
career
,
by
leading
an
army
against
his
father
;
but
his
father
beat
him
and
his
army
back
;
and
thousands
of
his
men
would
have
rued
the
day
in
which
they
fought
in
such
a
wicked
cause
,
had
not
the
King
received
news
of
an
invasion
of
England
by
the
Scots
,
and
promptly
come
home
through
a
great
storm
to
repress
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
whether
he
really
began
to
fear
that
he
suffered
these
troubles
because
a
Becket
had
been
murdered
;
or
whether
he
wished
to
rise
in
the
favour
of
the
Pope
,
who
had
now
declared
a
Becket
to
be
a
saint
,
or
in
the
favour
of
his
own
people
,
of
whom
many
believed
that
even
a
Becket
's
senseless
tomb
could
work
miracles
,
I
do
n't
know
:
 
but
the
King
no
sooner
landed
in
England
than
he
went
straight
to
Canterbury
;
and
when
he
came
within
sight
of
the
distant
Cathedral
,
he
dismounted
from
his
horse
,
took
off
his
shoes
,
and
walked
with
bare
and
bleeding
feet
to
a
Becket
's
grave
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
lay
down
on
the
ground
,
lamenting
,
in
the
presence
of
many
people
;
and
by
-
and
-
by
<EOS>
he
went
into
the
Chapter
House
,
and
,
removing
his
clothes
from
his
back
and
shoulders
,
submitted
himself
to
be
beaten
with
knotted
cords
(
not
beaten
very
hard
,
I
dare
say
though
)
by
eighty
Priests
,
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
It
chanced
that
on
the
very
day
when
the
King
made
this
curious
exhibition
of
himself
,
a
complete
victory
was
obtained
over
the
Scots
;
which
very
much
delighted
the
Priests
,
who
said
that
it
was
won
because
of
his
great
example
of
repentance
.
<EOS>
For
the
Priests
in
general
had
found
out
,
since
a
Becket
's
death
,
that
they
admired
him
of
all
things
---
though
they
had
hated
him
very
cordially
when
he
was
alive
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Flanders
,
who
was
at
the
head
of
the
base
conspiracy
of
the
King
's
undutiful
sons
and
their
foreign
friends
,
took
the
opportunity
of
the
King
being
thus
employed
at
home
,
to
lay
siege
to
Rouen
,
the
capital
of
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
,
who
was
extraordinarily
quick
and
active
in
all
his
movements
,
was
at
Rouen
,
too
,
before
it
was
supposed
possible
that
he
could
have
left
England
;
and
there
he
so
defeated
the
said
Earl
of
Flanders
,
that
the
conspirators
proposed
peace
,
and
his
bad
sons
Henry
and
Geoffrey
submitted
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
resisted
for
six
weeks
;
but
,
being
beaten
out
of
castle
after
castle
,
he
at
last
submitted
too
,
and
his
father
forgave
him
.
  
<EOS>
To
forgive
these
unworthy
princes
was
only
to
afford
them
breathing
-
time
for
new
faithlessness
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
false
,
disloyal
,
and
dishonourable
,
that
they
were
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
common
thieves
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
very
next
year
,
Prince
Henry
rebelled
again
,
and
was
again
forgiven
.
 
<EOS>
In
eight
years
more
,
Prince
Richard
rebelled
against
his
elder
brother
;
and
Prince
Geoffrey
infamously
said
that
the
brothers
could
never
agree
well
together
,
unless
they
were
united
against
their
father
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
very
next
year
after
their
reconciliation
by
the
King
,
Prince
Henry
again
rebelled
against
his
father
;
and
again
submitted
,
swearing
to
be
true
;
and
was
again
forgiven
;
and
again
rebelled
with
Geoffrey
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
end
of
this
perfidious
Prince
was
come
.
 
<EOS>
He
fell
sick
at
a
French
town
;
and
his
conscience
terribly
reproaching
him
with
his
baseness
,
he
sent
messengers
to
the
King
his
father
,
imploring
him
to
come
and
see
him
,
and
to
forgive
him
for
the
last
time
on
his
bed
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
generous
King
,
who
had
a
royal
and
forgiving
mind
towards
his
children
always
,
would
have
gone
;
but
this
Prince
had
been
so
unnatural
,
that
the
noblemen
about
the
King
suspected
treachery
,
and
represented
to
him
that
he
could
not
safely
trust
his
life
with
such
a
traitor
,
though
his
own
eldest
son
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
the
King
sent
him
a
ring
from
off
his
finger
as
a
token
of
forgiveness
;
and
when
the
Prince
had
kissed
it
,
with
much
grief
and
many
tears
,
and
had
confessed
to
those
around
him
how
bad
,
and
wicked
,
and
undutiful
a
son
he
had
been
;
he
said
to
the
attendant
Priests
:
 
"
O
,
tie
a
rope
about
my
body
,
and
draw
me
out
of
bed
,
and
lay
me
down
upon
a
bed
of
ashes
,
that
I
may
die
with
prayers
to
God
in
a
repentant
manner
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
died
,
at
twenty
-
seven
years
old
.
  
<EOS>
Three
years
afterwards
,
Prince
Geoffrey
,
being
unhorsed
at
a
tournament
,
had
his
brains
trampled
out
by
a
crowd
of
horses
passing
over
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
there
only
remained
Prince
Richard
,
and
Prince
John
---
who
had
grown
to
be
a
young
man
now
,
and
had
solemnly
sworn
to
be
faithful
to
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
soon
rebelled
again
,
encouraged
by
his
friend
the
French
King
,
PHILIP
<EOS>
THE
SECOND
(
son
of
Louis
,
who
was
dead
)
;
and
soon
submitted
and
was
again
forgiven
,
swearing
on
the
New
Testament
never
to
rebel
again
;
and
in
another
year
or
so
,
rebelled
again
;
and
,
in
the
presence
of
his
father
,
knelt
down
on
his
knee
before
the
King
of
France
;
and
did
the
French
King
homage
:
 
and
declared
that
with
his
aid
he
would
possess
himself
,
by
force
,
of
all
his
father
's
French
dominions
.
  
<EOS>
And
yet
this
Richard
called
himself
a
soldier
of
Our
Saviour
!
 
<EOS>
And
yet
this
Richard
wore
the
Cross
,
which
the
Kings
of
France
and
England
had
both
taken
,
in
the
previous
year
,
at
a
brotherly
meeting
underneath
the
old
wide
-
spreading
elm
-
tree
on
the
plain
,
when
they
had
sworn
(
like
him
)
to
devote
themselves
to
a
new
Crusade
,
for
the
love
and
honour
of
the
Truth
!
  
<EOS>
Sick
at
heart
,
wearied
out
by
the
falsehood
of
his
sons
,
and
almost
ready
to
lie
down
and
die
,
the
unhappy
King
who
had
so
long
stood
firm
,
began
to
fail
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Pope
,
to
his
honour
,
supported
him
;
and
obliged
the
French
King
and
Richard
,
though
successful
in
fight
,
to
treat
for
peace
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
wanted
to
be
Crowned
King
of
England
,
and
pretended
that
he
wanted
to
be
married
(
which
he
really
did
not
)
to
the
French
King
's
sister
,
his
promised
wife
,
whom
King
Henry
detained
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
King
Henry
wanted
,
on
the
other
hand
,
that
the
French
King
's
sister
should
be
married
to
his
favourite
son
,
John
:
 
the
only
one
of
his
sons
(
he
said
)
who
had
never
rebelled
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
King
Henry
,
deserted
by
his
nobles
one
by
one
,
distressed
,
exhausted
,
broken
-
hearted
,
consented
to
establish
peace
.
  
<EOS>
One
final
heavy
sorrow
was
reserved
for
him
,
even
yet
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
brought
him
the
proposed
treaty
of
peace
,
in
writing
,
as
he
lay
very
ill
in
bed
,
they
brought
him
also
the
list
of
the
deserters
from
their
allegiance
,
whom
he
was
required
to
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
name
upon
this
list
was
John
,
his
favourite
son
,
in
whom
he
had
trusted
to
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
"
O
John
!
<EOS>
child
of
my
heart
!
"
exclaimed
the
King
,
in
a
great
agony
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
"
O
John
,
whom
I
have
loved
the
best
!
 
<EOS>
O
John
,
for
whom
I
have
contended
through
these
many
troubles
!
 
<EOS>
Have
you
betrayed
me
too
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
lay
down
with
a
heavy
groan
,
and
said
,
"
Now
let
the
world
go
as
it
will
.
 
<EOS>
I
care
for
nothing
more
!
"
  
<EOS>
After
a
time
,
he
told
his
attendants
to
take
him
to
the
French
town
of
Chinon
---
a
town
he
had
been
fond
of
,
during
many
years
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
fond
of
no
place
now
;
it
was
too
true
that
he
could
care
for
nothing
more
upon
this
earth
.
 
<EOS>
He
wildly
cursed
the
hour
when
he
was
born
,
and
cursed
the
children
whom
he
left
behind
him
;
and
expired
.

As
,
one
hundred
years
before
,
the
servile
followers
of
the
Court
had
abandoned
the
Conqueror
in
the
hour
of
his
death
,
so
they
now
abandoned
his
descendant
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
body
was
stripped
,
in
the
plunder
of
the
Royal
chamber
;
and
it
was
not
easy
to
find
the
means
of
carrying
it
for
burial
to
the
abbey
church
of
Fontevraud
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
was
said
in
after
years
,
by
way
of
flattery
,
to
have
the
heart
of
a
Lion
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
far
better
,
I
think
,
to
have
had
the
heart
of
a
Man
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
,
whatever
it
was
,
had
cause
to
beat
remorsefully
within
his
breast
,
when
he
came
---
as
he
did
---
into
the
solemn
abbey
,
and
looked
on
his
dead
father
's
uncovered
face
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
,
whatever
it
was
,
had
been
a
black
and
perjured
heart
,
in
all
its
dealings
with
the
deceased
King
,
and
more
deficient
in
a
single
touch
of
tenderness
than
any
wild
beast
's
in
the

<EOS>
There
is
a
pretty
story
told
of
this
Reign
,
called
the
story
of
FAIR
ROSAMOND
.
 
<EOS>
It
relates
how
the
King
doted
on
Fair
Rosamond
,
who
was
the
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
world
;
and
how
he
had
a
beautiful
Bower
built
for
her
in
a
Park
at
Woodstock
;
and
how
it
was
erected
in
a
labyrinth
,
and
could
only
be
found
by
a
clue
of
silk
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
bad
Queen
Eleanor
,
becoming
jealous
of
Fair
Rosamond
,
found
out
the
secret
of
the
clue
,
and
one
day
,
appeared
before
her
,
with
a
dagger
and
a
cup
of
poison
,
and
left
her
to
the
choice
between
those
deaths
.
 
<EOS>
How
Fair
Rosamond
,
after
shedding
many
piteous
tears
and
offering
many
useless
prayers
to
the
cruel
Queen
,
took
the
poison
,
and
fell
dead
in
the
midst
of
the
beautiful
bower
,
while
the
unconscious
birds
sang
gaily
all
around
her
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
there
WAS
a
fair
Rosamond
,
and
she
was
(
I
dare
say
)
<EOS>
the
loveliest
girl
in
all
the
world
,
and
the
King
was
certainly
very
fond
of
her
,
and
the
bad
Queen
Eleanor
was
certainly
made
jealous
.
<EOS>
But
I
am
afraid
---
I
say
afraid
,
because
I
like
the
story
so
much
---
that
there
was
no
bower
,
no
labyrinth
,
no
silken
clue
,
no
dagger
,
no
poison
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
fair
Rosamond
retired
to
a
nunnery
near
Oxford
,
and
died
there
,
peaceably
;
her
sister
-
nuns
hanging
a
silken
drapery
over
her
tomb
,
and
often
dressing
it
with
flowers
,
in
remembrance
of
the
youth
and
beauty
that
had
enchanted
the
King
when
he
too
was
young
,
and
when
his
life
lay
fair
before
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
dark
and
ended
now
;
faded
and
gone
.

Henry
Plantagenet
lay
quiet
in
the
abbey
church
of
Fontevraud
,
in
the
fifty
-
seventh
year
of
his
age
---
never
to
be
completed
---
after
governing
England
well
,
for
nearly
thirty
-
five
years
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Richard
<EOS>
the
First
,
Called
the
Lion
-
Heart
    
<EOS>
IN
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
one
hundred
and
eighty
-
nine
,
Richard
of
the
Lion
Heart
succeeded
to
the
throne
of
King
Henry
the
Second
,
whose
paternal
heart
he
had
done
so
much
to
break
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
,
as
we
have
seen
,
a
rebel
from
his
boyhood
;
but
,
the
moment
he
became
a
king
against
whom
others
might
rebel
<EOS>
,
he
found
out
that
rebellion
was
a
great
wickedness
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
heat
of
this
pious
discovery
,
he
punished
all
the
leading
people
who
had
befriended
him
against
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
scarcely
have
done
anything
that
would
have
been
a
better
instance
of
his
real
nature
,
or
a
better
warning
to
fawners
and
parasites
not
to
trust
in
lion
-
hearted
princes
.
  
<EOS>
He
likewise
put
his
late
father
's
treasurer
in
chains
,
and
locked
him
up
in
a
dungeon
from
which
he
was
not
set
free
until
he
had
relinquished
,
not
only
all
the
Crown
treasure
,
but
all
his
own
money
too
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Richard
certainly
got
the
Lion
's
share
of
the
wealth
of
this
wretched
treasurer
,
whether
he
had
a
Lion
's
heart
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
crowned
King
of
England
,
with
great
pomp
,
at
Westminster
:
walking
to
the
Cathedral
under
a
silken
canopy
stretched
on
the
tops
of
four
lances
,
each
carried
by
a
great
lord
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
of
his
coronation
,
a
dreadful
murdering
of
the
Jews
took
place
,
which
seems
to
have
given
great
delight
to
numbers
of
savage
persons
calling
themselves
Christians
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
had
issued
a
proclamation
forbidding
the
Jews
(
who
were
generally
hated
,
though
they
were
the
most
useful
merchants
in
England
)
to
appear
at
the
ceremony
;
but
as
they
had
assembled
in
London
from
all
parts
,
bringing
presents
to
show
their
respect
for
the
new
Sovereign
,
some
of
them
ventured
down
to
Westminster
Hall
with
their
gifts
;
which
were
very
readily
accepted
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
,
now
,
that
some
noisy
fellow
in
the
crowd
,
pretending
to
be
a
very
delicate
Christian
,
set
up
a
howl
at
this
,
and
struck
a
Jew
who
was
trying
to
get
in
at
the
Hall
door
with
his
present
.
 
<EOS>
A
riot
arose
.
 
<EOS>
The
Jews
who
had
got
into
the
Hall
,
were
driven
forth
;
and
some
of
the
rabble
cried
out
that
the
new
King
had
commanded
the
unbelieving
race
to
be
put
to
death
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
the
crowd
rushed
through
the
narrow
streets
of
the
city
,
slaughtering
all
the
Jews
they
met
;
and
when
they
could
find
no
more
out
of
doors
(
on
account
of
their
having
fled
to
their
houses
,
and
fastened
themselves
in
)
,
they
ran
madly
about
,
breaking
open
all
the
houses
where
the
Jews
lived
,
rushing
in
and
stabbing
or
spearing
them
,
sometimes
even
flinging
old
people
and
children
out
of
window
into
blazing
fires
they
had
lighted
up
below
.
 
<EOS>
This
great
cruelty
lasted
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
and
only
three
men
were
punished
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
Even
they
forfeited
their
lives
not
for
murdering
and
robbing
the
Jews
,
but
for
burning
the
houses
of
some
Christians
.
  
<EOS>
King
Richard
,
who
was
a
strong
,
restless
,
burly
man
,
with
one
idea
always
in
his
head
,
and
that
the
very
troublesome
idea
of
breaking
the
heads
of
other
men
,
was
mightily
impatient
to
go
on
a
Crusade
to
the
Holy
Land
,
with
a
great
army
.
 
<EOS>
As
great
armies
could
not
be
raised
to
go
,
even
to
the
Holy
Land
,
without
a
great
deal
of
money
,
he
sold
the
Crown
domains
,
and
even
the
high
offices
of
State
;
recklessly
appointing
noblemen
to
rule
over
his
English
subjects
,
not
because
they
were
fit
to
govern
,
but
because
they
could
pay
high
for
the
privilege
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
,
and
by
selling
pardons
at
a
dear
rate
and
by
varieties
of
avarice
and
oppression
,
he
scraped
together
a
large
treasure
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
appointed
two
Bishops
to
take
care
of
his
kingdom
in
his
absence
,
and
gave
great
powers
and
possessions
to
his
brother
John
,
to
secure
his
friendship
.
 
<EOS>
John
would
rather
have
been
made
Regent
of
England
;
but
he
was
a
sly
man
,
and
friendly
to
the
expedition
;
saying
to
himself
,
no
doubt
,
"
The
more
fighting
,
the
more
chance
of
my
brother
being
killed
;
and
when
he
IS
killed
,
then
I
become
King
John
!
"
  
<EOS>
Before
the
newly
levied
army
departed
from
England
,
the
recruits
and
the
general
populace
distinguished
themselves
by
astonishing
cruelties
on
the
unfortunate
Jews
:
 
whom
,
in
many
large
towns
,
they
murdered
by
hundreds
in
the
most
horrible
manner
.
  
<EOS>
At
York
,
a
large
body
of
Jews
took
refuge
in
the
Castle
,
in
the
absence
of
its
Governor
,
after
the
wives
and
children
of
many
of
them
had
been
slain
before
their
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
came
the
Governor
,
and
demanded
admission
.
 
<EOS>
"
How
can
we
give
it
thee
,
O
Governor
!
"
said
the
Jews
upon
the
walls
,
"
when
,
if
we
open
the
gate
by
so
much
as
the
width
of
a
foot
,
the
roaring
crowd
behind
thee
will
press
in
and
kill
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
unjust
Governor
became
angry
,
and
told
the
people
that
he
approved
of
their
killing
those
Jews
;
and
a
mischievous
maniac
of
a
friar
,
dressed
all
in
white
,
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
assault
,
and
they
assaulted
the
Castle
for
three
days
.
  
<EOS>
Then
said
JOCEN
,
the
head
-
Jew
(
who
was
a
Rabbi
or
Priest
)
,
to
the
rest
,
"
Brethren
,
there
is
no
hope
for
us
with
the
Christians
who
are
hammering
at
the
gates
and
walls
,
and
who
must
soon
break
in
.
<EOS>
As
we
and
our
wives
and
children
must
die
,
either
by
Christian
hands
,
or
by
our
own
,
let
it
be
by
our
own
.
 
<EOS>
Let
us
destroy
by
fire
<EOS>
what
jewels
and
other
treasure
we
have
here
,
then
fire
the
castle
,
and
then
perish
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
few
could
not
resolve
to
do
this
,
but
the
greater
part
complied
.
<EOS>
They
made
a
blazing
heap
of
all
their
valuables
,
and
,
when
those
were
consumed
,
set
the
castle
in
flames
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
flames
roared
and
crackled
around
them
,
and
shooting
up
into
the
sky
,
turned
it
blood
-
red
,
Jocen
cut
the
throat
of
his
beloved
wife
,
and
stabbed
himself
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
others
who
had
wives
or
children
,
did
the
like
dreadful
deed
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
populace
broke
in
,
they
found
(
except
the
trembling
few
,
cowering
in
corners
,
whom
they
soon
killed
)
<EOS>
only
heaps
of
greasy
cinders
,
with
here
<EOS>
and
there
something
like
part
of
the
blackened
trunk
of
a
burnt
tree
,
but
which
had
lately
been
a
human
creature
,
formed
by
the
beneficent
hand
of
the
Creator
as
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
bad
beginning
,
Richard
and
his
troops
went
on
,
in
no
very
good
manner
,
with
the
Holy
Crusade
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
undertaken
jointly
by
the
King
of
England
and
his
old
friend
Philip
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
They
commenced
the
business
by
reviewing
their
forces
,
to
the
number
of
one
hundred
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
Afterwards
,
they
severally
embarked
their
troops
for
Messina
,
in
Sicily
,
which
was
appointed
as
the
next
place
of
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
King
Richard
's
sister
had
married
the
King
of
this
place
,
but
he
was
dead
:
 
and
his
uncle
TANCRED
had
usurped
the
crown
,
cast
the
Royal
Widow
into
prison
,
and
possessed
himself
of
her
estates
.
<EOS>
Richard
fiercely
demanded
his
sister
's
release
,
the
restoration
of
her
lands
,
and
(
according
to
the
Royal
custom
of
the
Island
)
that
she
should
have
a
golden
chair
,
a
golden
table
,
four
-
and
-
twenty
silver
cups
,
and
four
-
and
-
twenty
silver
dishes
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
too
powerful
to
be
successfully
resisted
,
Tancred
yielded
to
his
demands
;
and
then
the
French
King
grew
jealous
,
and
complained
that
the
English
King
wanted
to
be
absolute
in
the
Island
of
Messina
and
everywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
,
however
,
cared
little
or
nothing
for
this
complaint
;
and
in
consideration
of
a
present
of
twenty
thousand
pieces
of
gold
,
promised
his
pretty
little
nephew
ARTHUR
,
then
a
child
of
two
years
old
,
in
marriage
to
Tancred
's
daughter
.
<EOS>
We
shall
hear
again
of
pretty
little
Arthur
by
-
and
-
by
.
  
<EOS>
This
Sicilian
affair
arranged
without
anybody
's
brains
being
knocked
out
(
which
must
have
rather
disappointed
him
)
,
King
Richard
took
his
sister
away
,
and
also
a
fair
lady
named
BERENGARIA
,
with
whom
he
had
fallen
in
love
in
France
,
and
whom
his
mother
,
Queen
Eleanor
(
so
long
in
prison
,
you
remember
,
but
released
by
Richard
on
his
coming
to
the
Throne
)
,
had
brought
out
there
to
be
his
wife
;
and
sailed
with
them
for
Cyprus
.
  
<EOS>
He
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
fighting
the
King
of
the
Island
of
Cyprus
,
for
allowing
his
subjects
to
pillage
some
of
the
English
troops
who
were
shipwrecked
on
the
shore
;
and
easily
conquering
this
poor
monarch
,
he
seized
his
only
daughter
,
to
be
a
companion
to
the
lady
Berengaria
,
and
put
the
King
himself
into
silver
fetters
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
sailed
away
again
with
his
mother
,
sister
,
wife
,
and
the
captive
princess
;
and
soon
arrived
before
the
town
of
Acre
,
which
the
French
King
with
his
fleet
was
besieging
from
the
sea
.
<EOS>
But
the
French
King
was
in
no
triumphant
condition
,
for
his
army
had
been
thinned
by
the
swords
of
the
Saracens
,
and
wasted
by
the
plague
;
and
SALADIN
,
the
brave
Sultan
of
the
Turks
,
at
the
head
of
a
numerous
army
,
was
at
that
time
gallantly
defending
the
place
from
the
hills
that
rise
above
it
.
  
<EOS>
Wherever
the
united
army
of
Crusaders
went
,
they
agreed
in
few
points
except
in
gaming
,
drinking
,
and
quarrelling
,
in
a
most
unholy
manner
;
in
debauching
the
people
among
whom
they
tarried
,
whether
they
were
friends
or
foes
;
and
in
carrying
disturbance
and
ruin
into
quiet
places
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
King
was
jealous
of
the
English
King
,
and
the
English
King
was
jealous
of
the
French
King
,
and
the
disorderly
and
violent
soldiers
of
the
two
nations
were
jealous
of
one
another
;
consequently
,
the
two
Kings
could
not
at
first
agree
,
even
upon
a
joint
assault
on
Acre
;
but
when
they
did
make
up
their
quarrel
for
that
purpose
,
the
Saracens
promised
to
yield
the
town
,
to
give
up
to
the
Christians
the
wood
of
the
Holy
Cross
,
to
set
at
liberty
all
their
Christian
captives
,
and
to
pay
two
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
to
be
done
within
forty
days
;
but
,
not
being
done
,
King
Richard
ordered
some
three
thousand
Saracen
prisoners
to
be
brought
out
in
the
front
of
his
camp
,
and
there
,
in
full
view
of
their
own
countrymen
,
to
be
butchered
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
King
had
no
part
in
this
crime
;
for
he
was
by
that
time
travelling
homeward
with
the
greater
part
of
his
men
;
being
offended
by
the
overbearing
conduct
of
the
English
King
;
being
anxious
to
look
after
his
own
dominions
;
and
being
ill
,
besides
,
from
the
unwholesome
air
of
that
hot
and
sandy
country
.
 
<EOS>
King
Richard
carried
on
the
war
without
him
;
and
remained
in
the
East
,
meeting
with
a
variety
of
adventures
,
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
.
<EOS>
Every
night
when
his
army
was
on
the
march
,
and
came
to
a
halt
,
the
heralds
cried
out
three
times
,
to
remind
all
the
soldiers
of
the
cause
in
which
they
were
engaged
,
"
Save
the
Holy
Sepulchre
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
all
the
soldiers
knelt
and
said
"
Amen
!
"
 
<EOS>
Marching
or
encamping
,
the
army
had
continually
to
strive
with
the
hot
air
of
the
glaring
desert
,
or
with
the
Saracen
soldiers
animated
and
directed
by
the
brave
Saladin
,
or
with
both
together
.
 
<EOS>
Sickness
and
death
,
battle
and
wounds
,
were
always
among
them
;
but
through
every
difficulty
King
Richard
fought
like
a
giant
,
and
worked
like
a
common
labourer
.
 
<EOS>
Long
and
long
after
he
was
quiet
in
his
grave
,
his
terrible
battle
-
axe
,
with
twenty
English
pounds
of
English
steel
in
its
mighty
head
,
was
a
legend
among
the
Saracens
;
and
when
all
the
Saracen
and
Christian
hosts
had
been
dust
for
many
a
year
,
if
a
Saracen
horse
started
at
any
object
by
the
wayside
,
his
rider
would
exclaim
,
"
What
dost
thou
fear
,
Fool
?
 
<EOS>
Dost
thou
think
King
Richard
is
behind
it
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
No
one
admired
this
King
's
renown
for
bravery
more
than
Saladin
himself
,
who
was
a
generous
and
gallant
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
When
Richard
lay
ill
of
a
fever
,
Saladin
sent
him
fresh
fruits
from
Damascus
,
and
snow
from
the
mountain
-
tops
.
 
<EOS>
Courtly
messages
and
compliments
were
frequently
exchanged
between
them
---
and
then
King
Richard
would
mount
his
horse
and
kill
as
many
Saracens
as
he
could
;
and
Saladin
would
mount
his
,
and
kill
as
many
Christians
as
he
could
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
way
King
Richard
fought
to
his
heart
's
content
at
Arsoof
and
at
Jaffa
;
and
finding
himself
with
nothing
exciting
to
do
at
Ascalon
,
except
to
rebuild
,
for
his
own
defence
,
some
fortifications
there
which
the
Saracens
had
destroyed
,
he
kicked
his
ally
the
Duke
of
Austria
,
for
being
too
proud
to
work
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
army
at
last
came
within
sight
of
the
Holy
City
of
Jerusalem
;
but
,
being
then
a
mere
nest
of
jealousy
,
and
quarrelling
and
fighting
,
soon
retired
,
and
agreed
with
the
Saracens
upon
a
truce
for
three
years
,
three
months
,
three
days
,
and
three
hours
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
English
Christians
,
protected
by
the
noble
Saladin
from
Saracen
revenge
,
visited
Our
Saviour
's
tomb
;
and
then
King
Richard
embarked
with
a
small
force
at
Acre
to
return
home
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
was
shipwrecked
in
the
Adriatic
Sea
,
and
was
fain
to
pass
through
Germany
,
under
an
assumed
name
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
there
were
many
people
in
Germany
who
had
served
in
the
Holy
Land
under
that
proud
Duke
of
Austria
who
had
been
kicked
;
and
some
of
them
,
easily
recognising
a
man
so
remarkable
as
King
Richard
,
carried
their
intelligence
to
the
kicked
Duke
,
who
straightway
took
him
prisoner
at
a
little
inn
near
Vienna
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
's
master
the
Emperor
of
Germany
,
and
the
King
of
France
,
were
equally
delighted
to
have
<EOS>
so
troublesome
a
monarch
in
safe
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
Friendships
which
are
founded
on
a
partnership
in
doing
wrong
,
are
never
true
;
and
the
King
of
France
was
now
quite
as
heartily
King
Richard
's
foe
,
as
he
had
ever
been
his
friend
in
his
unnatural
conduct
to
his
father
.
 
<EOS>
He
monstrously
pretended
that
King
Richard
had
designed
to
poison
him
in
the
East
;
he
charged
him
with
having
murdered
,
there
,
a
man
whom
he
had
in
truth
befriended
;
he
bribed
the
Emperor
of
Germany
to
keep
him
close
prisoner
;
and
,
finally
,
through
the
plotting
of
these
two
princes
,
Richard
was
brought
before
the
German
legislature
,
charged
with
the
foregoing
crimes
,
and
many
others
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
defended
himself
so
well
,
that
many
of
the
assembly
were
moved
to
tears
by
his
eloquence
and
earnestness
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
decided
that
he
should
be
treated
,
during
the
rest
of
his
captivity
,
in
a
manner
more
becoming
his
dignity
than
he
had
been
,
and
that
he
should
be
set
free
on
the
payment
of
a
heavy
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
This
ransom
the
English
people
willingly
raised
.
<EOS>
When
Queen
Eleanor
took
it
over
to
Germany
,
it
was
at
first
evaded
and
refused
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
appealed
to
the
honour
of
all
the
princes
of
the
German
Empire
in
behalf
of
her
son
,
and
appealed
so
well
that
it
was
accepted
,
and
the
King
released
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
King
of
France
wrote
to
Prince
John
---
"
Take
care
of
thyself
.
 
<EOS>
The
devil
is
unchained
!
"
  
<EOS>
Prince
John
had
reason
to
fear
his
brother
,
for
he
had
been
a
traitor
to
him
in
his
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
secretly
joined
the
French
King
;
had
vowed
to
the
English
nobles
and
people
that
his
brother
was
dead
;
and
had
vainly
tried
to
seize
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
in
France
,
at
a
place
called
Evreux
.
 
<EOS>
Being
the
meanest
and
basest
of
men
,
he
contrived
a
mean
and
base
expedient
for
making
himself
acceptable
to
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
He
invited
the
French
officers
of
the
garrison
in
that
town
to
dinner
,
murdered
them
all
,
and
then
took
the
fortress
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
recommendation
to
the
good
will
of
a
lion
-
hearted
monarch
,
he
hastened
to
King
Richard
,
fell
on
his
knees
before
him
,
and
obtained
the
intercession
of
Queen
Eleanor
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
forgive
him
,
"
said
the
King
,
"
and
<EOS>
I
hope
I
may
forget
the
injury
he
has
done
me
,
as
easily
as
I
know
he
will
forget
my
pardon
.
"
  
<EOS>
While
King
Richard
was
in
Sicily
,
there
had
been
trouble
in
his
dominions
at
home
:
 
one
of
the
bishops
whom
he
had
left
in
charge
thereof
,
arresting
the
other
;
and
making
,
in
his
pride
and
ambition
,
as
great
a
show
as
if
he
were
King
himself
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
hearing
of
it
at
Messina
,
and
appointing
a
new
Regency
,
this
LONGCHAMP
(
for
that
was
his
name
)
had
fled
to
France
in
a
woman
's
dress
,
and
had
there
been
encouraged
and
supported
by
the
French
King
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
these
causes
of
offence
against
Philip
in
his
mind
,
King
Richard
had
no
sooner
been
welcomed
home
by
his
enthusiastic
subjects
with
great
display
and
splendour
,
and
had
no
sooner
been
crowned
afresh
at
Winchester
,
than
he
resolved
to
show
the
French
King
that
the
Devil
was
unchained
indeed
,
and
made
war
against
him
with
great
fury
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
fresh
trouble
at
home
about
this
time
,
arising
out
of
the
discontents
of
the
poor
people
,
who
complained
that
they
were
far
more
heavily
taxed
than
the
rich
,
and
who
found
a
spirited
champion
in
WILLIAM
FITZ
-
OSBERT
,
called
LONGBEARD
.
 
<EOS>
He
became
the
leader
of
a
secret
society
,
comprising
fifty
thousand
men
;
he
was
seized
by
surprise
;
he
stabbed
the
citizen
who
first
laid
hands
upon
him
;
and
retreated
,
bravely
fighting
,
to
a
church
,
which
he
maintained
four
days
,
until
he
was
dislodged
by
fire
,
and
run
through
the
body
as
he
came
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
killed
,
though
;
for
he
was
dragged
,
half
dead
,
at
the
tail
of
a
horse
to
Smithfield
,
and
there
hanged
.
<EOS>
Death
was
long
a
favourite
remedy
for
silencing
the
people
's
advocates
;
but
as
we
go
on
with
this
history
,
I
fancy
we
shall
find
them
difficult
to
make
an
end
of
,
for
all
that
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
war
,
delayed
occasionally
by
a
truce
,
was
still
in
progress
when
a
certain
Lord
named
VIDOMAR
,
Viscount
of
Limoges
,
chanced
to
find
in
his
ground
a
treasure
of
ancient
coins
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
King
's
vassal
,
he
sent
the
King
half
of
it
;
but
the
King
claimed
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
The
lord
refused
to
yield
the
whole
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
besieged
the
lord
in
his
castle
,
swore
that
he
would
take
the
castle
by
storm
,
and
hang
every
man
of
its
defenders
on
the
battlements
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
strange
old
song
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
to
the
effect
that
in
Limoges
an
arrow
would
be
made
by
which
King
Richard
would
die
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
be
that
BERTRAND
DE
GOURDON
,
a
young
man
who
was
one
of
the
defenders
of
the
castle
,
had
often
sung
it
or
heard
it
sung
of
a
winter
night
,
and
remembered
it
when
he
saw
,
from
his
post
upon
the
ramparts
,
the
King
attended
only
by
his
chief
officer
riding
below
the
walls
surveying
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
He
drew
an
arrow
to
the
head
,
took
steady
aim
,
said
between
his
teeth
,
"
<EOS>
Now
I
pray
God
speed
thee
<EOS>
well
,
arrow
!
<EOS>
"
discharged
it
,
and
struck
the
King
in
the
left
shoulder
.
  
<EOS>
Although
the
wound
was
not
at
first
considered
dangerous
,
it
was
severe
enough
to
cause
the
King
to
retire
to
his
tent
,
and
direct
the
assault
to
be
made
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
castle
was
taken
;
and
every
man
of
its
defenders
was
hanged
,
as
the
King
had
sworn
all
should
be
,
except
Bertrand
de
Gourdon
,
who
was
reserved
until
the
royal
pleasure
respecting
him
should
be
known
.
  
<EOS>
By
that
time
unskilful
treatment
had
made
the
wound
mortal
and
the
King
knew
that
he
was
dying
.
 
<EOS>
He
directed
Bertrand
to
be
brought
into
his
tent
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
man
was
brought
there
,
heavily
chained
,
King
Richard
looked
at
him
steadily
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
,
as
steadily
,
at
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
"
Knave
!
"
said
King
Richard
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
have
I
done
to
thee
that
thou
shouldest
take
my
life
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
What
hast
thou
done
to
me
?
"
replied
the
young
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
With
thine
own
hands
thou
hast
killed
my
father
and
my
two
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
Myself
thou
wouldest
have
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
Let
me
die
now
,
by
any
torture
that
thou
wilt
.
 
<EOS>
My
comfort
is
,
that
no
torture
can
save
Thee
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
too
must
die
;
and
,
through
me
,
the
world
is
quit
of
thee
!
"
  
<EOS>
Again
the
King
looked
at
the
young
man
steadily
.
 
<EOS>
Again
the
young
man
looked
steadily
at
him
.
 
<EOS>
Perhaps
some
remembrance
of
his
generous
enemy
Saladin
,
who
was
not
a
Christian
,
came
into
the
mind
of
the
dying
King
.
  
<EOS>
"
Youth
!
"
<EOS>
he
said
,
"
I
forgive
thee
.
 
<EOS>
Go
unhurt
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
turning
to
the
chief
officer
who
had
been
riding
in
his
company
when
he
received
the
wound
,
King
Richard
said
:
  
"
Take
off
his
chains
,
give
him
a
hundred
shillings
,
and
let
him
depart
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
sunk
down
on
his
couch
,
and
a
dark
mist
seemed
in
his
weakened
eyes
to
fill
the
tent
wherein
he
had
so
often
rested
,
and
he
died
.
<EOS>
His
age
was
forty
-
two
;
he
had
reigned
ten
years
.
 
<EOS>
His
last
command
was
not
obeyed
;
for
the
chief
officer
flayed
Bertrand
de
Gourdon
alive
,
and
hanged
him
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
an
old
tune
yet
known
---
a
sorrowful
air
will
sometimes
outlive
many
generations
of
strong
men
,
and
even
last
longer
than
battle
-
axes
with
twenty
pounds
of
steel
in
the
head
---
by
which
this
King
is
said
to
have
been
discovered
in
his
captivity
.
 
<EOS>
BLONDEL
,
a
favourite
Minstrel
of
King
Richard
,
as
the
story
relates
,
faithfully
seeking
his
Royal
master
,
went
singing
it
outside
the
gloomy
walls
of
many
foreign
fortresses
and
prisons
;
until
at
last
he
heard
it
echoed
from
within
a
dungeon
,
and
knew
the
voice
,
and
cried
out
in
ecstasy
,
"
O
Richard
,
O
my
King
!
"
 
<EOS>
You
may
believe
it
,
if
you
like
;
it
would
be
easy
to
believe
worse
things
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
was
himself
a
Minstrel
and
a
Poet
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
not
been
a
Prince
too
,
he
might
have
been
a
better
man
perhaps
,
and
might
have
gone
out
of
the
world
with
less
bloodshed
and
waste
of
life
to
answer
for
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
King
John
,
Called
Lackland
    
AT
two
-
and
-
thirty
years
of
age
<EOS>
,
JOHN
became
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
His
pretty
little
nephew
ARTHUR
had
the
best
claim
to
the
throne
;
but
John
seized
the
treasure
,
and
made
fine
promises
to
the
nobility
,
and
got
himself
crowned
at
Westminster
within
a
few
weeks
after
his
brother
Richard
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
the
crown
could
possibly
have
been
put
upon
the
head
of
a
meaner
coward
,
or
a
more
detestable
villain
,
if
England
had
been
searched
from
end
to
end
to
find
him
out
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
King
,
Philip
,
refused
to
acknowledge
the
right
of
John
to
his
new
dignity
,
and
declared
in
favour
of
Arthur
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
not
suppose
that
he
had
any
generosity
of
feeling
for
the
fatherless
boy
;
it
merely
suited
his
ambitious
schemes
to
oppose
the
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
So
John
and
the
French
King
went
to
war
about
Arthur
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
handsome
boy
,
at
that
time
only
twelve
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
born
when
his
father
,
Geoffrey
,
had
his
brains
trampled
out
at
the
tournament
;
and
,
besides
the
misfortune
of
never
having
known
a
father
's
guidance
and
protection
,
he
had
the
additional
misfortune
to
have
a
foolish
mother
(
CONSTANCE
by
name
)
,
<EOS>
lately
married
to
her
third
husband
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
Arthur
,
upon
John
's
accession
,
to
the
French
King
,
who
pretended
to
be
very
much
his
friend
,
and
who
made
him
a
Knight
,
and
promised
him
his
daughter
in
marriage
;
but
,
who
cared
so
little
about
him
in
reality
,
that
finding
it
his
interest
to
make
peace
with
King
John
for
a
time
,
he
did
so
without
the
least
consideration
for
the
poor
little
Prince
,
and
heartlessly
sacrificed
all
his
interests
.
  
<EOS>
Young
Arthur
,
for
two
years
afterwards
,
lived
quietly
;
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
his
mother
died
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
French
King
then
finding
it
his
interest
to
quarrel
with
King
John
again
,
again
made
Arthur
his
pretence
,
and
invited
the
orphan
boy
to
court
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
know
your
rights
,
Prince
,
"
said
the
French
King
,
"
and
you
would
like
to
be
a
King
.
 
<EOS>
Is
it
not
so
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
"
said
Prince
Arthur
,
"
I
should
greatly
like
to
be
a
King
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
Philip
,
"
you
shall
have
two
hundred
gentlemen
who
are
Knights
of
mine
,
and
with
them
you
shall
go
to
win
back
the
provinces
belonging
to
you
,
of
which
your
uncle
,
the
usurping
King
of
England
,
has
taken
possession
.
 
<EOS>
I
myself
,
meanwhile
,
will
head
a
force
against
him
in
Normandy
.
"
<EOS>
Poor
Arthur
was
so
flattered
and
so
grateful
that
he
signed
a
treaty
with
the
crafty
French
King
,
agreeing
to
consider
him
his
superior
Lord
,
and
that
the
French
King
should
keep
for
himself
whatever
he
could
take
from
King
John
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
King
John
was
so
bad
in
all
ways
,
and
King
Philip
was
so
perfidious
,
that
Arthur
,
between
the
two
,
might
as
well
have
been
a
lamb
between
a
fox
and
a
wolf
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
being
so
young
,
he
was
ardent
and
flushed
with
hope
;
and
,
<EOS>
when
the
people
of
Brittany
(
which
was
his
inheritance
)
sent
him
five
hundred
more
knights
and
five
thousand
foot
soldiers
,
he
believed
his
fortune
was
made
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
of
Brittany
had
been
fond
of
him
from
his
birth
,
and
had
requested
that
he
might
be
called
Arthur
,
in
remembrance
of
that
dimly
-
famous
English
Arthur
,
of
whom
I
told
you
early
in
this
book
,
whom
they
believed
to
have
been
the
brave
friend
and
companion
of
an
old
King
of
their
own
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
tales
among
them
about
a
prophet
called
MERLIN
(
of
the
same
old
time
)
,
who
had
foretold
that
their
own
King
should
be
restored
to
them
after
hundreds
of
years
;
and
they
believed
that
the
prophecy
would
be
fulfilled
in
Arthur
;
that
the
time
would
come
when
he
would
rule
them
with
a
crown
of
Brittany
upon
his
head
;
and
when
neither
King
of
France
nor
King
of
England
would
have
any
power
over
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
Arthur
found
himself
riding
in
a
glittering
suit
of
armour
on
a
richly
caparisoned
horse
,
at
the
head
of
his
train
of
knights
and
soldiers
,
he
began
to
believe
this
too
,
and
to
consider
old
Merlin
a
very
superior
prophet
.
  
<EOS>
He
did
not
know
---
how
could
he
,
being
so
innocent
and
inexperienced
?
---
that
his
little
army
was
a
mere
nothing
against
the
power
of
the
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
King
knew
it
;
but
the
poor
boy
's
fate
was
little
to
him
,
so
that
the
King
of
England
was
worried
and
distressed
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
King
Philip
went
his
way
into
Normandy
and
Prince
Arthur
went
his
way
towards
Mirebeau
,
a
French
town
near
Poictiers
,
both
very
well
pleased
.
  
<EOS>
Prince
Arthur
went
to
attack
the
town
of
Mirebeau
,
because
his
grandmother
Eleanor
,
who
has
so
often
made
her
appearance
in
this
history
(
and
who
had
always
been
his
mother
's
enemy
)
,
was
living
there
,
and
because
his
Knights
said
,
"
Prince
,
if
you
can
take
her
prisoner
,
you
will
be
able
to
bring
the
King
your
uncle
to
terms
!
"
<EOS>
But
she
was
not
to
be
easily
taken
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
old
enough
by
this
time
---
eighty
<EOS>
---
but
she
was
as
full
of
stratagem
as
she
was
full
of
years
and
wickedness
.
 
<EOS>
Receiving
intelligence
of
young
Arthur
's
approach
,
she
shut
herself
up
in
a
high
tower
,
and
encouraged
her
soldiers
to
defend
it
like
men
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Arthur
with
his
little
army
besieged
the
high
tower
.
 
<EOS>
King
John
,
hearing
how
matters
stood
,
came
up
to
the
rescue
,
with
HIS
army
.
 
<EOS>
So
here
was
a
strange
family
-
party
!
 
<EOS>
The
boy
-
Prince
besieging
his
grandmother
,
and
his
uncle
besieging
him
!
  
<EOS>
This
position
of
affairs
did
not
last
long
.
 
<EOS>
One
summer
night
King
John
,
by
treachery
,
got
his
men
into
the
town
,
surprised
Prince
Arthur
's
force
,
took
two
hundred
of
his
knights
,
and
seized
the
Prince
himself
in
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Knights
were
put
in
heavy
irons
,
and
driven
away
in
open
carts
drawn
by
bullocks
,
to
various
dungeons
where
they
were
most
inhumanly
treated
,
and
where
some
of
them
were
starved
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Arthur
was
sent
to
the
castle
of
Falaise
.
  
<EOS>
One
day
,
while
he
was
in
prison
at
that
castle
,
mournfully
thinking
it
strange
that
one
so
young
should
be
in
so
much
trouble
,
and
looking
out
of
the
small
window
in
the
deep
dark
wall
,
at
the
summer
sky
and
the
birds
,
the
door
was
softly
opened
,
and
he
saw
his
uncle
the
King
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
archway
,
looking
very
grim
.
  
<EOS>
"
Arthur
,
"
said
the
King
,
with
his
wicked
eyes
more
on
the
stone
floor
than
on
his
nephew
,
"
will
you
not
trust
to
the
gentleness
,
the
friendship
,
and
the
truthfulness
of
your
loving
uncle
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
I
will
tell
my
loving
uncle
that
,
"
replied
the
boy
,
"
when
he
does
me
right
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
restore
to
me
my
kingdom
of
England
,
and
then
come
to
me
and
ask
the
question
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
The
King
looked
at
him
and
went
out
.
 
<EOS>
"
Keep
that
boy
close
prisoner
,
"
said
he
to
the
warden
of
the
castle
.
  
<EOS>
Then
,
the
King
took
secret
counsel
with
the
worst
of
his
nobles
how
the
Prince
was
to
be
got
rid
of
.
 
<EOS>
Some
said
,
"
Put
out
his
eyes
and
keep
him
in
prison
,
as
Robort
of
Normandy
was
kept
.
"
 
<EOS>
Others
said
,
"
Have
him
stabbed
.
"
 
Others
,
"
Have
him
hanged
.
"
 
Others
,
"
Have
him
poisoned
.
"
  
<EOS>
King
John
,
feeling
that
in
any
case
,
whatever
was
done
afterwards
,
it
would
be
a
satisfaction
to
his
mind
to
have
those
handsome
eyes
burnt
out
that
had
looked
at
him
so
proudly
while
his
own
royal
eyes
were
blinking
at
the
stone
floor
,
sent
certain
ruffians
to
Falaise
to
blind
the
boy
with
red
-
hot
irons
.
 
<EOS>
But
Arthur
so
pathetically
entreated
them
,
and
shed
such
piteous
tears
,
and
so
appealed
to
HUBERT
DE
BOURG
(
or
BURGH
)
,
the
warden
of
the
castle
,
who
had
a
love
for
him
,
and
was
an
honourable
,
tender
man
,
that
Hubert
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
his
eternal
honour
he
prevented
the
torture
from
being
performed
,
and
,
at
his
own
risk
,
sent
the
savages
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
chafed
and
disappointed
King
bethought
himself
of
the
stabbing
suggestion
next
,
and
,
with
his
shuffling
manner
and
his
cruel
face
,
proposed
it
to
one
William
de
Bray
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
a
gentleman
and
not
an
executioner
,
"
said
William
de
Bray
,
and
left
the
presence
with
disdain
.
  
<EOS>
But
it
was
not
difficult
for
a
King
to
hire
a
murderer
in
those
days
.
 
<EOS>
King
John
found
one
for
his
money
,
and
sent
him
down
to
the
castle
of
Falaise
.
 
<EOS>
"
On
what
errand
dost
thou
come
?
"
said
Hubert
to
this
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
"
To
despatch
young
Arthur
,
"
he
returned
.
 
<EOS>
"
Go
back
to
him
who
sent
thee
,
"
answered
Hubert
,
"
and
say
that
I
will
do
it
!
"
  
<EOS>
King
John
very
well
knowing
that
Hubert
would
never
do
it
,
but
that
he
courageously
sent
this
reply
to
save
the
Prince
or
gain
time
,
despatched
messengers
to
convey
the
young
prisoner
to
the
castle
of
Rouen
.
  
<EOS>
Arthur
was
soon
forced
from
the
good
Hubert
---
of
whom
he
had
never
stood
in
greater
need
than
then
---
carried
away
by
night
,
and
lodged
in
his
new
prison
:
 
where
,
through
his
grated
window
,
he
could
hear
the
deep
waters
of
the
river
Seine
,
rippling
against
the
stone
wall
below
.
  
<EOS>
One
dark
night
,
as
he
lay
sleeping
,
dreaming
perhaps
of
rescue
by
those
unfortunate
gentlemen
who
were
obscurely
suffering
and
dying
in
his
cause
,
he
was
roused
,
and
bidden
by
his
jailer
to
come
down
the
staircase
to
the
foot
of
the
tower
.
 
<EOS>
He
hurriedly
dressed
himself
and
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
the
bottom
of
the
winding
stairs
,
and
the
night
air
from
the
river
blew
upon
their
faces
,
the
jailer
trod
upon
his
torch
and
put
it
out
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Arthur
,
in
the
darkness
,
was
hurriedly
drawn
into
a
solitary
boat
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
that
boat
,
he
found
his
uncle
and
one
other
man
.
  
<EOS>
He
knelt
to
them
,
and
prayed
them
not
to
murder
him
.
 
<EOS>
Deaf
to
his
entreaties
,
they
stabbed
him
and
sunk
his
body
in
the
river
with
heavy
stones
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
spring
-
morning
broke
,
the
tower
-
door
was
closed
,
the
boat
was
gone
,
the
river
sparkled
on
its
way
,
and
never
more
was
any
trace
of
the
poor
boy
beheld
by
mortal
eyes
.
  
<EOS>
The
news
of
this
atrocious
murder
being
spread
in
England
,
awakened
a
hatred
of
the
King
(
already
odious
for
his
many
vices
,
and
for
his
having
stolen
away
and
married
a
noble
lady
while
his
own
wife
was
living
)
<EOS>
that
never
slept
again
through
his
whole
reign
.
 
<EOS>
In
Brittany
,
the
indignation
was
intense
.
 
<EOS>
Arthur
's
own
sister
ELEANOR
was
in
the
power
of
John
and
shut
up
in
a
convent
at
Bristol
,
but
his
half
-
sister
ALICE
was
in
Brittany
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
chose
her
,
and
the
murdered
prince
's
father
-
in
-
law
,
the
last
husband
of
Constance
,
to
represent
them
;
and
carried
their
fiery
complaints
to
King
Philip
.
 
<EOS>
King
Philip
summoned
King
John
(
as
the
holder
of
territory
in
France
)
to
come
before
him
and
defend
himself
.
 
<EOS>
King
John
refusing
to
appear
<EOS>
,
King
Philip
declared
him
false
,
perjured
,
and
guilty
;
and
again
made
war
.
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
,
by
conquering
the
greater
part
of
his
French
territory
,
King
Philip
deprived
him
of
one
-
third
of
his
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
through
all
the
fighting
that
took
place
,
King
John
was
always
found
,
either
to
be
eating
and
drinking
,
like
a
gluttonous
fool
,
when
the
danger
was
at
a
distance
,
or
to
be
running
away
,
like
a
beaten
cur
,
when
it
was
near
.
  
<EOS>
You
might
suppose
that
when
he
was
losing
his
dominions
at
this
rate
,
and
when
his
own
nobles
cared
so
little
for
him
or
his
cause
that
they
plainly
refused
to
follow
his
banner
out
of
England
,
he
had
enemies
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
made
another
enemy
of
the
Pope
,
which
he
did
in
this
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
dying
,
and
the
junior
monks
of
that
place
wishing
to
get
the
start
of
the
senior
monks
in
the
appointment
of
his
successor
,
met
together
at
midnight
,
secretly
elected
a
certain
REGINALD
,
and
sent
him
off
to
Rome
to
get
the
Pope
's
approval
.
 
<EOS>
The
senior
monks
and
the
King
soon
finding
this
out
,
and
being
very
angry
about
it
,
the
junior
monks
gave
way
,
and
all
the
monks
together
elected
the
Bishop
of
Norwich
,
who
was
the
King
's
favourite
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
,
hearing
the
whole
story
,
declared
that
neither
election
would
do
for
him
,
and
that
HE
elected
STEPHEN
LANGTON
.
 
<EOS>
The
monks
submitting
to
the
Pope
<EOS>
,
the
King
turned
them
all
out
bodily
,
and
banished
them
as
traitors
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
sent
three
bishops
to
the
King
,
to
threaten
him
with
an
Interdict
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
told
the
bishops
that
if
any
Interdict
were
laid
upon
his
kingdom
,
he
would
tear
out
the
eyes
and
cut
off
the
noses
of
all
the
monks
he
could
lay
hold
of
,
and
send
them
over
to
Rome
in
that
undecorated
state
as
a
present
for
their
master
.
 
<EOS>
The
bishops
,
nevertheless
,
soon
published
the
Interdict
,
and
fled
.
  
<EOS>
After
it
had
lasted
a
year
,
the
Pope
proceeded
to
his
next
step
;
which
was
Excommunication
.
 
<EOS>
King
John
was
declared
excommunicated
,
with
all
the
usual
ceremonies
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
so
incensed
at
this
,
and
was
made
so
desperate
by
the
disaffection
of
his
Barons
and
the
hatred
of
his
people
,
that
it
is
said
he
even
privately
sent
ambassadors
to
the
Turks
in
Spain
,
offering
to
renounce
his
religion
and
hold
his
kingdom
of
them
if
they
would
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
related
that
the
ambassadors
were
admitted
to
the
presence
of
the
Turkish
Emir
through
long
lines
of
Moorish
guards
,
and
that
they
found
the
Emir
with
his
eyes
seriously
fixed
on
the
pages
of
a
large
book
,
from
which
he
never
once
looked
up
.
 
<EOS>
That
they
gave
him
a
letter
from
the
King
containing
his
proposals
,
and
were
gravely
dismissed
.
 
<EOS>
That
presently
the
Emir
sent
for
one
of
them
,
and
conjured
him
,
by
his
faith
in
his
religion
,
to
say
what
kind
of
man
the
King
of
England
truly
was
?
 
<EOS>
That
the
ambassador
,
thus
pressed
,
replied
that
the
King
of
England
was
a
false
tyrant
,
against
whom
his
own
subjects
would
soon
rise
.
 
<EOS>
And
that
this
was
quite
enough
for
the
Emir
.
  
<EOS>
Money
being
,
in
his
position
,
the
next
best
thing
to
men
<EOS>
,
King
John
spared
no
means
of
getting
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
set
on
foot
another
oppressing
and
torturing
of
the
unhappy
Jews
(
which
was
quite
in
his
way
)
,
and
invented
a
new
punishment
for
one
wealthy
Jew
of
Bristol
.
 
<EOS>
Until
such
time
as
that
Jew
should
produce
a
certain
large
sum
of
money
,
the
King
sentenced
him
to
be
imprisoned
,
and
,
every
day
,
to
have
one
tooth
violently
wrenched
out
of
his
head
---
beginning
with
the
double
teeth
.
 
<EOS>
For
seven
days
,
the
oppressed
man
bore
the
daily
pain
and
lost
the
daily
tooth
;
but
,
on
the
eighth
,
he
paid
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
treasure
raised
in
such
ways
,
the
King
made
an
expedition
into
Ireland
,
where
some
English
nobles
had
revolted
.
<EOS>
It
was
one
of
the
very
few
places
from
which
he
did
not
run
away
;
because
no
resistance
was
shown
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
another
expedition
into
Wales
---
<EOS>
whence
he
DID
run
away
in
the
end
:
 
but
not
before
he
had
got
from
the
Welsh
people
,
as
hostages
,
twenty
-
seven
young
men
of
the
best
families
;
every
one
of
whom
he
caused
to
be
slain
in
the
following
year
.
  
<EOS>
To
Interdict
and
Excommunication
,
the
Pope
now
added
his
last
sentence
;
Deposition
.
 
<EOS>
He
proclaimed
John
no
longer
King
,
absolved
all
his
subjects
from
their
allegiance
,
and
sent
Stephen
Langton
and
others
to
the
King
of
France
to
tell
him
that
,
if
he
would
invade
England
,
he
should
be
forgiven
all
his
sins
---
at
least
,
should
be
forgiven
them
by
the
Pope
,
if
that
would
do
.
  
<EOS>
As
there
was
nothing
that
King
Philip
desired
more
than
to
invade
England
,
he
collected
a
great
army
at
Rouen
,
and
a
fleet
of
seventeen
hundred
ships
to
bring
them
over
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
English
people
,
however
bitterly
they
hated
the
King
,
were
not
a
people
to
suffer
invasion
quietly
.
 
<EOS>
They
flocked
to
Dover
,
where
the
English
standard
was
,
in
such
great
numbers
to
enrol
themselves
as
defenders
of
their
native
land
,
that
there
were
not
provisions
for
them
,
and
the
King
could
only
select
and
retain
sixty
thousand
.
<EOS>
But
,
at
this
crisis
,
the
Pope
,
who
had
his
own
reasons
for
objecting
to
either
King
John
or
King
Philip
being
too
powerful
,
interfered
.
 
<EOS>
He
entrusted
a
legate
,
whose
name
was
PANDOLF
,
with
the
easy
task
of
frightening
King
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
him
to
the
English
Camp
,
from
France
,
to
terrify
him
with
exaggerations
of
King
Philip
's
power
,
and
his
own
weakness
in
the
discontent
of
the
English
Barons
and
people
.
 
<EOS>
Pandolf
discharged
his
commission
so
well
,
that
King
John
,
in
a
wretched
panic
,
consented
to
acknowledge
Stephen
Langton
;
to
resign
his
kingdom
"
to
God
,
Saint
Peter
,
and
Saint
Paul
"
---
which
meant
the
Pope
;
and
to
hold
it
,
ever
afterwards
,
by
the
Pope
's
leave
,
on
payment
of
an
annual
sum
of
money
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
shameful
contract
he
publicly
bound
himself
in
the
church
of
the
Knights
Templars
at
Dover
:
 
where
he
laid
at
the
legate
's
feet
a
part
of
the
tribute
,
which
the
legate
haughtily
trampled
upon
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
DO
say
,
that
this
was
merely
a
genteel
flourish
,
and
that
he
was
afterwards
seen
to
pick
it
up
and
pocket
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
an
unfortunate
prophet
,
the
name
of
Peter
,
who
had
greatly
increased
King
John
's
terrors
by
predicting
that
he
would
be
unknighted
(
which
the
King
supposed
to
signify
that
he
would
die
)
before
the
Feast
of
the
Ascension
should
be
past
.
 
<EOS>
That
was
the
day
after
this
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
next
morning
came
,
and
the
King
,
who
had
been
trembling
all
night
,
found
himself
alive
and
safe
,
he
ordered
the
prophet
---
and
his
son
too
---
to
be
dragged
through
the
streets
at
the
tails
of
horses
,
and
then
hanged
,
for
having
frightened
him
.
  
<EOS>
As
King
John
had
now
submitted
,
the
Pope
,
to
King
Philip
's
great
astonishment
,
took
him
under
his
protection
,
and
informed
King
Philip
that
he
found
he
could
not
give
him
leave
to
invade
England
.
<EOS>
The
angry
Philip
resolved
to
do
it
without
his
leave
but
he
gained
nothing
and
lost
much
;
for
,
the
English
,
commanded
by
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
went
over
,
in
five
hundred
ships
,
to
the
French
coast
,
before
the
French
fleet
had
sailed
away
from
it
,
and
utterly
defeated
the
whole
.
  
<EOS>
The
Pope
then
took
off
his
three
sentences
,
one
after
another
,
and
empowered
Stephen
Langton
publicly
to
receive
King
John
into
the
favour
of
the
Church
again
,
and
to
ask
him
to
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
hated
Langton
with
all
his
might
and
main
---
<EOS>
and
with
reason
too
,
for
he
was
a
great
and
a
good
man
,
with
whom
such
a
King
could
have
no
sympathy
---
pretended
to
cry
and
to
be
VERY
grateful
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
little
difficulty
about
settling
how
much
the
King
should
pay
as
a
recompense
to
the
clergy
for
the
losses
he
had
caused
them
;
but
,
the
end
of
it
was
,
that
the
superior
clergy
got
a
good
deal
,
and
the
inferior
clergy
got
little
or
nothing
---
<EOS>
which
has
also
happened
since
King
John
's
time
,
I
believe
.
  
<EOS>
When
all
these
matters
were
arranged
,
the
King
in
his
triumph
became
more
fierce
,
and
false
,
and
insolent
to
all
around
him
than
he
had
ever
been
.
 
<EOS>
An
alliance
of
sovereigns
against
King
Philip
,
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
landing
an
army
in
France
;
with
which
he
even
took
a
town
!
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
French
King
's
gaining
a
great
victory
,
he
ran
away
,
of
course
,
and
made
a
truce
for
five
years
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
time
approached
when
he
was
to
be
still
further
humbled
,
and
made
to
feel
,
if
he
could
feel
anything
,
what
a
wretched
creature
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
men
in
the
world
,
Stephen
Langton
seemed
raised
up
by
Heaven
to
oppose
and
subdue
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
ruthlessly
burnt
and
destroyed
the
property
of
his
own
subjects
,
because
their
Lords
,
the
Barons
,
would
not
serve
him
abroad
,
Stephen
Langton
fearlessly
reproved
and
threatened
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
swore
to
restore
the
laws
of
King
Edward
,
or
the
laws
of
King
Henry
<EOS>
the
First
,
Stephen
Langton
knew
his
falsehood
,
and
pursued
him
through
all
his
evasions
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Barons
met
at
the
abbey
of
Saint
Edmund's
-
Bury
,
to
consider
their
wrongs
and
the
King
's
oppressions
,
Stephen
Langton
roused
them
by
his
fervid
words
to
demand
a
solemn
charter
of
rights
and
liberties
from
their
perjured
master
,
and
to
swear
,
one
by
one
,
on
the
High
Altar
,
that
they
would
have
it
,
or
would
wage
war
against
him
to
the
death
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
hid
himself
in
London
from
the
Barons
,
and
was
at
last
obliged
to
receive
them
,
they
told
him
roundly
they
would
not
believe
him
unless
Stephen
Langton
became
a
surety
that
he
would
keep
his
word
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
took
the
Cross
to
invest
himself
with
some
interest
,
and
belong
to
something
that
was
received
with
favour
,
Stephen
Langton
was
still
immovable
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
appealed
to
the
Pope
,
and
the
Pope
wrote
to
Stephen
Langton
in
behalf
of
his
new
favourite
,
Stephen
Langton
was
deaf
,
even
to
the
Pope
himself
,
and
saw
before
him
nothing
but
the
welfare
of
England
and
the
crimes
of
the
English
King
.
  
<EOS>
At
Easter
-
time
,
the
Barons
assembled
at
Stamford
,
in
Lincolnshire
,
in
proud
array
,
and
,
marching
near
to
Oxford
where
the
King
was
,
delivered
into
the
hands
of
Stephen
Langton
and
two
others
,
a
list
of
grievances
.
 
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
these
,
"
they
said
,
"
he
must
redress
,
or
we
will
do
it
for
ourselves
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
Stephen
Langton
told
the
King
as
much
,
and
read
the
list
to
him
,
he
went
half
mad
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
But
that
did
him
no
more
good
than
his
afterwards
trying
to
pacify
the
Barons
with
lies
.
 
<EOS>
They
called
themselves
and
their
followers
,
"
The
army
of
God
and
the
Holy
Church
.
"
 
<EOS>
Marching
through
the
country
,
with
the
people
thronging
to
them
everywhere
(
except
at
Northampton
,
where
they
failed
in
an
attack
upon
the
castle
)
,
they
at
last
triumphantly
set
up
their
banner
in
London
itself
,
whither
the
whole
land
,
tired
of
the
tyrant
,
seemed
to
flock
to
join
them
.
<EOS>
Seven
knights
alone
,
of
all
the
knights
in
England
,
remained
with
the
King
;
who
,
reduced
to
this
strait
,
at
last
sent
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
to
the
Barons
to
say
that
he
approved
of
everything
,
and
would
meet
them
to
sign
their
charter
when
they
would
.
 
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
the
Barons
,
"
let
the
day
be
the
fifteenth
of
June
,
and
the
place
,
Runny
-
Mead
.
"
  
<EOS>
On
Monday
,
the
fifteenth
of
June
,
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
fourteen
,
the
King
came
from
Windsor
Castle
,
and
the
Barons
came
from
the
town
of
Staines
,
and
they
met
on
Runny
-
Mead
,
which
is
still
a
pleasant
meadow
by
the
Thames
,
where
rushes
grow
in
the
clear
water
of
the
winding
river
,
and
its
banks
are
green
with
grass
and
trees
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
side
of
the
Barons
,
came
the
General
of
their
army
,
ROBERT
FITZ
-
WALTER
,
and
a
great
concourse
of
the
nobility
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
King
,
came
,
in
all
,
<EOS>
some
four
-
and
-
twenty
persons
of
any
note
,
most
of
whom
despised
him
,
and
were
merely
his
advisers
in
form
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
great
day
,
and
in
that
great
company
,
the
King
signed
MAGNA
CHARTA
---
the
great
charter
of
England
---
by
which
he
pledged
himself
to
maintain
the
Church
in
its
rights
;
to
relieve
the
Barons
of
oppressive
obligations
as
vassals
of
the
Crown
---
of
which
the
Barons
,
in
their
turn
,
pledged
themselves
to
relieve
THEIR
vassals
,
the
people
;
to
respect
the
liberties
of
London
and
all
other
cities
and
boroughs
;
to
protect
foreign
merchants
who
came
to
England
;
to
imprison
no
man
without
a
fair
trial
;
and
to
sell
,
delay
,
or
deny
justice
to
none
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
Barons
knew
his
falsehood
<EOS>
well
,
they
further
required
,
as
their
securities
,
that
he
should
send
out
of
his
kingdom
all
his
foreign
troops
;
that
for
two
months
they
should
hold
possession
of
the
city
of
London
,
and
Stephen
Langton
of
the
Tower
;
and
that
five
-
and
-
twenty
of
their
body
,
chosen
by
themselves
,
should
be
a
lawful
committee
to
watch
the
keeping
of
the
charter
,
and
to
make
war
upon
him
if
he
broke
it
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
he
was
obliged
to
yield
.
 
<EOS>
He
signed
the
charter
with
a
smile
,
and
,
if
he
could
have
looked
agreeable
,
would
have
done
so
,
as
he
departed
from
the
splendid
assembly
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
got
home
to
Windsor
Castle
,
he
was
quite
a
madman
in
his
helpless
fury
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
broke
the
charter
immediately
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
He
sent
abroad
for
foreign
soldiers
,
and
sent
to
the
Pope
for
help
,
and
plotted
to
take
London
by
surprise
,
while
the
Barons
should
be
holding
a
great
tournament
at
Stamford
,
which
they
had
agreed
to
hold
there
as
a
celebration
of
the
charter
.
 
<EOS>
The
Barons
,
however
,
found
him
out
and
put
it
off
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
Barons
desired
to
see
him
and
tax
him
with
his
treachery
,
he
made
numbers
of
appointments
with
them
,
and
kept
none
,
and
shifted
from
place
to
place
,
and
was
constantly
sneaking
and
skulking
about
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
appeared
at
Dover
,
to
join
his
foreign
soldiers
,
of
whom
numbers
came
into
his
pay
;
and
with
them
he
besieged
and
took
Rochester
Castle
,
which
was
occupied
by
knights
and
soldiers
of
the
Barons
.
 
<EOS>
He
would
have
hanged
them
every
one
;
but
the
leader
of
the
foreign
soldiers
,
fearful
of
what
the
English
people
might
afterwards
do
to
him
,
interfered
to
save
the
knights
;
therefore
the
King
was
fain
to
satisfy
his
vengeance
with
the
death
of
all
the
common
men
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
sent
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
with
one
portion
of
his
army
,
to
ravage
the
eastern
part
of
his
own
dominions
,
while
he
carried
fire
and
slaughter
into
the
northern
part
;
torturing
,
plundering
,
killing
,
and
inflicting
every
possible
cruelty
upon
the
people
;
and
,
every
morning
,
setting
a
worthy
example
to
his
men
by
setting
fire
,
with
his
own
monster
-
hands
,
to
the
house
where
he
had
slept
last
night
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
all
;
for
the
Pope
,
coming
to
the
aid
of
his
precious
friend
,
laid
the
kingdom
under
an
Interdict
again
,
because
the
people
took
part
with
the
Barons
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
much
matter
,
for
the
people
had
grown
so
used
to
it
now
,
that
they
had
begun
to
think
nothing
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
occurred
to
them
---
perhaps
to
Stephen
Langton
too
---
that
they
could
keep
their
churches
open
,
and
ring
their
bells
,
without
the
Pope
's
permission
as
well
as
with
it
.
<EOS>
So
,
they
tried
the
experiment
---
and
found
that
it
succeeded
perfectly
.
  
<EOS>
It
being
now
impossible
to
bear
the
country
,
as
a
wilderness
of
cruelty
,
or
longer
to
hold
any
terms
with
such
a
forsworn
outlaw
of
a
King
,
the
Barons
sent
to
Louis
,
son
of
the
French
monarch

offer
him
the

<EOS>
Caring
as
little
for
the
Pope
's
excommunication
of
him
<EOS>
if
he
accepted
the
offer
,
as
it
is
possible
his
father
may
have
cared
for
the
Pope
's
forgiveness
of
his
sins
,
he
landed
at
Sandwich
(
King
John
immediately
running
away
from
Dover
,
where
he
happened
to
be
)
,
and
went
on
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
King
,
with
whom
many
of
the
Northern
English
Lords
had
taken
refuge
;
numbers
of
the
foreign
soldiers
,
numbers
of
the
Barons
,
and
numbers
of
the
people
went
over
to
him
every
day
;
---
King
John
,
the
while
,
continually
running
away
in
all
directions
.
  
<EOS>
The
career
of
Louis
was
checked
however
,
by
the
suspicions
of
the
Barons
,
founded
on
the
dying
declaration
of
a
French
Lord
,
that
when
the
kingdom
was
conquered
he
was
sworn
to
banish
them
as
traitors
,
and
to
give
their
estates
to
some
of
his
own
Nobles
.
<EOS>
Rather
than
suffer
this
,
some
of
the
Barons
hesitated
:
 
<EOS>
others
even
went
over
to
King
John
.
  
<EOS>
It
seemed
to
be
the
turning
-
point
of
King
John
's
fortunes
,
for
,
in
his
savage
and
murderous
course
,
he
had
now
taken
some
towns
and
met
with
some
successes
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
happily
for
England
and
humanity
,
his
death
was
near
.
 
<EOS>
Crossing
a
dangerous
quicksand
,
called
the
Wash
,
not
very
far
from
Wisbeach
,
the
tide
came
up
and
nearly
drowned
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
soldiers
escaped
;
but
,
looking
back
from
the
shore
when
he
was
safe
,
he
saw
the
roaring
water
sweep
down
in
a
torrent
,
overturn
the
waggons
,
horses
,
and
men
,
that
carried
his
treasure
,
and
engulf
them
in
a
raging
whirlpool
from
which
nothing
could
be
delivered
.
  
<EOS>
Cursing
,
and
swearing
,
and
gnawing
his
fingers
,
he
went
on
to
Swinestead
Abbey
,
where
the
monks
set
before
him
quantities
of
pears
,
and
peaches
,
and
new
cider
---
<EOS>
some
say
poison
too
,
but
there
is
very
little
reason
to
suppose
so
---
of
which
he
ate
and
drank
in
an
immoderate
and
beastly
way
.
 
<EOS>
All
night
he
lay
ill
of
a
burning
fever
,
and
haunted
with
horrible
fears
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
they
put
him
in
a
horse
-
litter
,
and
carried
him
to
Sleaford
Castle
,
where
he
passed
another
night
of
pain
and
horror
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
they
carried
him
,
with
greater
difficulty
than
on
the
day
before
,
to
the
castle
of
Newark
upon
Trent
;
and
there
,
on
the
eighteenth
of
October
,
in
the
forty
-
ninth
year
of
his
age
,
and
the
seventeenth
of
his
vile
reign
,
was
an
end
of
this
miserable
brute
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Third
,
Called
,
of
Winchester
    
<EOS>
IF
any
of
the
English
Barons
remembered
the
murdered
Arthur
's
sister
,
Eleanor
the
fair
maid
of
Brittany
,
shut
up
in
her
convent
at
Bristol
,
none
among
them
spoke
of
her
now
,
or
maintained
her
right
to
the
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
The
dead
Usurper
's
eldest
boy
,
HENRY
by
name
,
was
taken
by
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
,
the
Marshal
of
England
,
to
the
city
of
Gloucester
,
and
there
crowned
in
great
haste
when
he
was
only
ten
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
Crown
itself
had
been
lost
with
the
King
's
treasure
in
the
raging
water
,
and
as
there
was
no
time
to
make
another
,
they
put
a
circle
of
plain
gold
upon
his
head
instead
.
 
<EOS>
"
We
have
been
the
enemies
of
this
child
's
father
,
"
said
Lord
Pembroke
,
a
good
and
true
gentleman
,
to
the
few
Lords
who
were
present
,
"
and
he
merited
our
ill
-
will
;
but
the
child
himself
is
innocent
,
and
his
youth
demands
our
friendship
and
protection
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Those
Lords
felt
tenderly
towards
the
little
boy
,
remembering
their
own
young
children
;
and
they
bowed
their
heads
,
and
said
,
"
Long
live
King
Henry
the
Third
!
"
  
<EOS>
Next
,
a
great
council
met
at
Bristol
,
revised
Magna
Charta
,
and
made
Lord
Pembroke
Regent
or
Protector
of
England
,
as
the
King
was
too
young
to
reign
alone
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
thing
to
be
done
,
was
to
get
rid
of
Prince
Louis
of
France
,
and
to
win
over
those
English
Barons
who
were
still
ranged
under
his
banner
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
strong
in
many
parts
of
England
,
and
in
London
itself
;
and
he
held
,
among
other
places
,
a
certain
Castle
called
the
Castle
of
Mount
Sorel
,
in
Leicestershire
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
fortress
,
after
some
skirmishing
and
truce
-
making
,
Lord
Pembroke
laid
siege
.
 
<EOS>
Louis
despatched
an
army
of
six
hundred
knights
and
twenty
thousand
soldiers
to
relieve
it
.
<EOS>
Lord
Pembroke
,
who
was
not
strong
enough
for
such
a
force
,
retired
with
all
his
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
army
of
the
French
Prince
,
which
had
marched
there
with
fire
and
plunder
,
marched
away
with
fire
and
plunder
,
and
came
,
in
a
boastful
swaggering
manner
,
to
Lincoln
.
 
<EOS>
The
town
submitted
;
but
the
Castle
in
the
town
,
held
by
a
brave
widow
lady
,
named
NICHOLA
DE
CAMVILLE
(
whose
property
it
was
)
,
made
such
a
sturdy
resistance
,
that
the
French
Count
in
command
of
the
army
of
the
French
Prince
found
it
necessary
to
besiege
this
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
engaged
,
word
was
brought
to
him
that
Lord
Pembroke
,
with
four
hundred
knights
,
two
hundred
and
fifty
men
with
cross
-
bows
,
and
a
stout
force
both
of
horse
and
foot
,
was
marching
towards
him
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
care
I
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
French
Count
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Englishman
is
not
so
mad
as
to
attack
me
and
my
great
army
in
a
walled
town
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
Englishman
did
it
for
all
that
,
and
did
it
---
not
so
madly
but
so
wisely
,
that
he
decoyed
the
great
army
into
the
narrow
,
ill
-
paved
lanes
and
byways
of
Lincoln
,
where
its
horse
-
soldiers
could
not
ride
in
any
strong
body
;
and
there
he
made
such
havoc
with
them
,
that
the
whole
force
surrendered
themselves
prisoners
,
except
the
Count
;
who
said
that
he
would
never
yield
to
any
English
traitor
alive
,
and
accordingly
got
killed
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
this
victory
,
which
the
English
called
,
for
a
joke
,
the
Fair
of
Lincoln
,
was
the
usual
one
in
those
times
---
the
common
men
were
slain
without
any
mercy
,
and
the
knights
and
gentlemen
paid
ransom
and
went
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
wife
of
Louis
,
the
fair
BLANCHE
OF
CASTILE
,
dutifully
equipped
a
fleet
of
eighty
good
ships
,
and
sent
it
over
from
France
to
her
husband
's
aid
.
 
<EOS>
An
English
fleet
of
forty
ships
,
some
good
and
some
bad
,
gallantly
met
them
near
the
mouth
of
the
Thames
,
and
took
or
sunk
sixty
-
five
in
one
fight
.
 
<EOS>
This
great
loss
put
an
end
to
the
French
Prince
's
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
A
treaty
was
made
at
Lambeth
,
in
virtue
of
which
the
English
Barons
who
had
remained
attached
to
his
cause
returned
to
their
allegiance
,
and
it
was
engaged
on
both
sides
that
the
Prince
and
all
his
troops
should
retire
peacefully
to
France
.
<EOS>
It
was
time
to
go
;
for
war
had
made
him
so
poor
that
he
was
obliged
to
borrow
money
from
the
citizens
of
London
to
pay
his
expenses
home
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Pembroke
afterwards
applied
himself
to
governing
the
country
justly
,
and
to
healing
the
quarrels
and
disturbances
that
had
arisen
among
men
in
the
days
of
the
bad
King
John
.
 
<EOS>
He
caused
Magna
Charta
to
be
still
more
improved
,
and
so
amended
the
Forest
Laws
that
a
Peasant
was
no
longer
put
to
death
for
killing
a
stag
in
a
Royal
Forest
,
but
was
only
imprisoned
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
well
for
England
if
it
could
have
had
so
good
a
Protector
many
years
longer
,
but
that
was
not
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Within
three
years
after
the
young
King
's
Coronation
,
Lord
Pembroke
died
;
and
you
may
see
his
tomb
,
at
this
day
,
in
the
old
Temple
Church
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
The
Protectorship
was
now
divided
.
 
<EOS>
PETER
DE
ROCHES
,
whom
King
John
had
made
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
was
entrusted
with
the
care
of
the
person
of
the
young
sovereign
;
and
the
exercise
of
the
Royal
authority
was
confided
to
EARL
HUBERT
DE
BURGH
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
personages
had
from
the
first
no
liking
for
each
other
,
and
soon
became
enemies
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
young
King
was
declared
of
age
,
Peter
de
Roches
,
finding
that
Hubert
increased
in
power
and
favour
,
retired
discontentedly
,
and
went
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
For
nearly
ten
years
afterwards
Hubert
had
full
sway
alone
.
  
<EOS>
But
ten
years
is
a
long
time
to
hold
the
favour
of
a
King
.
 
<EOS>
This
King
,
too
,
as
he
grew
up
,
showed
a
strong
resemblance
to
his
father
,
in
feebleness
,
inconsistency
,
and
irresolution
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
that
can
be
said
of
him
is
that
he
was
not
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
De
Roches
coming
home
again
,
after
ten
years
,
and
being
a
novelty
,
the
King
began
to
favour
him
and
to
look
coldly
on
Hubert
.
 
<EOS>
Wanting
money
besides
,
and
having
made
Hubert
rich
,
he
began
to
dislike
Hubert
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
he
was
made
to
believe
,
or
pretended
to
believe
,
that
Hubert
had
misappropriated
some
of
the
Royal
treasure
;
and
ordered
him
to
furnish
an
account
of
all
he
had
done
in
his
administration
.
<EOS>
Besides
which
,
the
foolish
charge
was
brought
against
Hubert
that
he
had
made
himself
the
King
's
favourite
by
magic
.
 
<EOS>
Hubert
very
well
knowing
that
he
could
never
defend
himself
against
such
nonsense
,
and
that
his
old
enemy
must
be
determined
on
his
ruin
,
instead
of
answering
the
charges
fled
to
Merton
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
King
,
in
a
violent
passion
,
sent
for
the
Mayor
of
London
,
and
said
to
the
Mayor
,
"
Take
twenty
thousand
citizens
,
and
drag
me
Hubert
de
Burgh
out
of
that
abbey
,
and
bring
him
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
Mayor
posted
off
to
do
it
,
but
the
Archbishop
of
Dublin
(
who
was
a
friend
of
Hubert
's
)
warning
the
King
that
an
abbey
was
a
sacred
place
,
and
that
if
he
committed
any
violence
there
,
he
must
answer
for
it
to
the
Church
,
the
King
changed
his
mind
and
called
the
Mayor
back
,
and
declared
that
Hubert
should
have
four
months
to
prepare
his
defence
,
and
should
be
safe
and
free
during
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
Hubert
,
who
relied
upon
the
King
's
word
,
though
I
think
he
was
old
enough
to
have
known
better
,
came
out
of
Merton
Abbey
upon
these
conditions
,
and
journeyed
away
to
see
his
wife
:
 
a
Scottish
Princess
who
was
then
at
St
Edmund's
-
Bury
.
  
<EOS>
Almost
as
soon
as
he
had
departed
from
the
Sanctuary
,
his
enemies
persuaded
the
weak
King
to
send
out
one
SIR
GODFREY
DE
CRANCUMB
,
who
commanded
three
hundred
vagabonds
called
the
Black
Band
,
with
orders
to
seize
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
up
with
him
at
a
little
town
in
Essex
,
called
Brentwood
,
when
he
was
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
He
leaped
out
of
bed
,
got
out
of
the
house
,
fled
to
the
church
,
ran
up
to
the
altar
,
and
laid
his
hand
upon
the
cross
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Godfrey
and
the
Black
Band
,
caring
neither
for
church
,
altar
,
nor
cross
,
dragged
him
forth
to
the
church
door
,
with
their
drawn
swords
flashing
round
his
head
,
and
sent
for
a
Smith
to
rivet
a
set
of
chains
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Smith
(
I
wish
I
knew
his
name
!
)
was
brought
,
all
dark
and
swarthy
with
the
smoke
of
his
forge
,
and
panting
with
the
speed
he
had
made
;
and
the
Black
Band
,
falling
aside
to
show
him
the
Prisoner
,
cried
with
a
loud
uproar
,
"
<EOS>
Make
the
fetters
heavy
!
<EOS>
make
them
strong
!
"
<EOS>
the
Smith
dropped
upon
his
knee
---
but
not
to
the
Black
Band
---
and
said
,
"
This
is
the
brave
Earl
Hubert
de
Burgh
,
who
fought
at
Dover
Castle
,
and
destroyed
the
French
fleet
,
and
has
done
his
country
much
good
service
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
kill
me
,
if
you
like
,
but
I
will
never
make
a
chain
for
Earl
Hubert
de
Burgh
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
Black
Band
never
blushed
,
or
they
might
have
blushed
at
this
.
<EOS>
They
knocked
the
Smith
about
from
one
to
another
,
and
swore
at
him
,
and
tied
the
Earl
on
horseback
,
undressed
as
he
was
,
and
carried
him
off
to
the
Tower
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishops
,
however
,
were
so
indignant
at
the
violation
of
the
Sanctuary
of
the
Church
,
that
the
frightened
King
soon
ordered
the
Black
Band
to
take
him
back
again
;
at
the
same
time
commanding
the
Sheriff
of
Essex
to
prevent
his
escaping
out
of
Brentwood
Church
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
the
Sheriff
dug
a
deep
trench
<EOS>
all
round
the
church
,
and
erected
a
high
fence
,
and
watched
the
church
night
and
day
;
the
Black
Band
and
their
Captain
watched
it
too
,
like
three
hundred
and
one
black
wolves
.
 
<EOS>
For
thirty
-
nine
days
,
Hubert
de
Burgh
remained
within
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
upon
the
fortieth
day
,
cold
and
hunger
were
too
much
for
him
,
and
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
Black
Band
,
who
carried
him
off
,
for
the
second
time
,
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
trial
came
on
,
he
refused
to
plead
;
but
at
last
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
give
up
all
the
royal
lands
which
had
been
bestowed
upon
him
,
and
should
be
kept
at
the
Castle
of
Devizes
,
in
what
was
called
"
free
prison
,
"
in
charge
of
four
knights
appointed
by
four
lords
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
remained
almost
a
year
,
until
,
learning
that
a
follower
of
his
old
enemy
the
Bishop
was
made
Keeper
of
the
Castle
,
and
fearing
that
he
might
be
killed
by
treachery
,
he
climbed
the
ramparts
one
dark
night
,
dropped
from
the
top
of
the
high
Castle
wall
into
the
moat
,
and
coming
safely
to
the
ground
,
took
refuge
in
another
church
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
place
he
was
delivered
by
a
party
of
horse
despatched
to
his
help
by
some
nobles
,
who
were
by
this
time
in
revolt
against
the
King
,
and
assembled
in
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
finally
pardoned
and
restored
to
his
estates
,
but
he
lived
privately
,
and
never
more
aspired
to
a
high
post
in
the
realm
,
or
to
a
high
place
in
the
King
's
favour
.
 
<EOS>
And
thus
end
---
more
happily
than
the
stories
of
many
favourites
of
Kings
---
<EOS>
the
adventures
of
Earl
Hubert
de
Burgh
.
  
<EOS>
The
nobles
,
who
had
risen
in
revolt
,
were
stirred
up
to
rebellion
by
the
overbearing
conduct
of
the
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
who
,
finding
that
the
King
secretly
hated
the
Great
Charter
which
had
been
forced
from
his
father
,
did
his
utmost
to
confirm
him
in
that
dislike
,
and
in
the
preference
he
showed
to
foreigners
over
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
Of
this
,
and
of
his
even
publicly
declaring
that
the
Barons
of
England
were
inferior
to
those
of
France
,
the
English
Lords
complained
with
such
bitterness
,
that
the
King
,
finding
them
well
supported
by
the
clergy
,
became
frightened
for
his
throne
,
and
sent
away
the
Bishop
and
all
his
foreign
associates
.
 
<EOS>
On
his
marriage
,
however
,
with
ELEANOR
,
a
French
lady
,
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Provence
,
he
openly
favoured
the
foreigners
again
;
and
so
many
of
his
wife
's
relations
came
over
,
and
made
such
an
immense
family
-
party
at
court
,
and
got
so
many
good
things
,
and
pocketed
so
much
money
,
and
were
so
high
with
the
English
whose
money
they
pocketed
,
that
the
bolder
English
Barons
murmured
openly
about
a
clause
there
was
in
the
Great
Charter
,
which
provided
for
the
banishment
of
unreasonable
favourites
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
foreigners
only
laughed
disdainfully
,
and
said
,
"
What
are
your
English
laws
to
us
?
"
  
<EOS>
King
Philip
of
France
had
died
,
and
had
been
succeeded
by
Prince
Louis
,
who
had
also
died
after
a
short
reign
of
three
years
,
and
had
been
succeeded
by
his
son
of
the
same
name
---
so
moderate
and
just
a
man
that
he
was
not
the
least
in
the
world
like
a
King
,
as
Kings
went
.
 
<EOS>
ISABELLA
,
King
Henry
's
mother
,
wished
very
much
(
for
a
certain
spite
she
had
)
that
England
should
make
war
against
this
King
;
and
,
as
King
Henry
was
a
mere
puppet
in
anybody
's
hands
who
knew
how
to
manage
his
feebleness
,
she
easily
carried
her
point
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Parliament
were
determined
to
give
him
no
money
for
such
a
war
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
to
defy
the
Parliament
,
he
packed
up
thirty
large
casks
of
silver
---
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
how
he
got
so
much
;
I
dare
say
he
screwed
it
out
of
the
miserable
Jews
---
and
put
them
aboard
ship
,
and
went
away
himself
to
carry
war
into
France
:
 
accompanied
by
his
mother
and
his
brother
Richard
,
Earl
of
Cornwall
,
who
was
rich
and
clever
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
only
got
well
beaten
,
and
came
home
.
  
<EOS>
The
good
-
humour
of
the
Parliament
was
not
restored
by
this
.
 
<EOS>
They
reproached
the
King
with
wasting
the
public
money
to
make
greedy
foreigners
rich
,
and
were
so
stern
with
him
,
and
so
determined
not
to
let
him
have
more
of
it
to
waste
if
they
could
help
it
,
that
he
was
at
his
wit
's
end
for
some
,
and
tried
so
shamelessly
to
get
all
he
could
from
his
subjects
,
by
excuses
or
by
force
,
that
the
people
used
to
say
the
King
was
the
sturdiest
beggar
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
the
Cross
,
thinking
to
get
some
money
by
that
means
;
but
,
as
it
was
very
well
known
that
he
never
meant
to
go
on
a
crusade
,
he
got
none
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
this
contention
,
the
Londoners
were
particularly
keen
against
the
King
,
and
the
King
hated
them
warmly
in
return
.
 
<EOS>
Hating
or
loving
,
however
,
made
no
difference
;
he
continued
in
the
same
condition
for
nine
or
ten
years
,
when
at
last
the
Barons
said
that
if
he
would
solemnly
confirm
their
liberties
afresh
,
the
Parliament
would
vote
him
a
large
sum
.
  
<EOS>
As
he
readily
consented
,
there
was
a
great
meeting
held
in
Westminster
Hall
,
one
pleasant
day
in
May
,
when
all
the
clergy
,
dressed
in
their
robes
and
holding
every
one
of
them
a
burning
candle
in
his
hand
,
stood
up
(
the
Barons
being
also
there
)
while
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
read
the
sentence
of
excommunication
against
any
man
,
and
all
men
,
who
should
henceforth
,
in
any
way
,
infringe
the
Great
Charter
of
the
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
done
,
they
all
put
out
their
burning
candles
with
a
curse
upon
the
soul
of
any
one
,
and
every
one
,
who
should
merit
that
sentence
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
concluded
with
an
oath
to
keep
the
Charter
,
"
As
I
am
a
man
,
as
I
am
a
Christian
,
as
I
am
a
Knight
,
as
I
am
a
King
!
"
  
<EOS>
It
was
easy
to
make
oaths
,
and
easy
to
break
them
;
and
the
King
did
both
,
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
to
his
old
courses
again
when
he
was
supplied
with
money
,
and
soon
cured
of
their
weakness
the
few
who
had
ever
really
trusted
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
money
was
gone
,
and
he
was
once
more
borrowing
and
begging
everywhere
with
a
meanness
worthy
of
his
nature
,
he
got
into
a
difficulty
with
the
Pope
respecting
the
Crown
of
Sicily
,
which
the
Pope
said
he
had
a
right
to
give
away
,
and
which
he
offered
to
King
Henry
for
his
second
son
,
PRINCE
EDMUND
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
if
you
or
I
give
away
what
we
have
not
got
,
and
what
belongs
to
somebody
else
,
it
is
likely
that
the
person
to
whom
we
give
it
,
will
have
some
trouble
in
taking
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
exactly
so
in
this
case
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
necessary
to
conquer
the
Sicilian
Crown
before
it
could
be
put
upon
young
Edmund
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
It
could
not
be
conquered
without
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
ordered
the
clergy
to
raise
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
clergy
,
however
,
were
not
so
obedient
to
him
as
usual
;
they
had
been
disputing
with
him
for
some
time
about
his
unjust
preference
of
Italian
Priests
in
England
;
and
they
had
begun
to
doubt
whether
the
King
's
chaplain
,
whom
he
allowed
to
be
paid
for
preaching
in
seven
hundred
churches
,
could
possibly
be
,
even
by
the
Pope
's
favour
,
in
seven
hundred
places
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
Pope
and
the
King
together
,
"
said
the
Bishop
of
London
,
"
may
take
the
mitre
off
my
head
;
but
,
if
they
do
,
they
will
find
that
I
shall
put
on
a
soldier
's
helmet
.
 
<EOS>
I
pay
nothing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Worcester
was
as
bold
as
the
Bishop
of
London
,
and
would
pay
nothing
either
.
 
<EOS>
Such
sums
as
the
more
timid
or
more
helpless
of
the
clergy
did
raise
were
squandered
away
,
without
doing
any
good
to
the
King
,
or
bringing
the
Sicilian
Crown
an
inch
nearer
to
Prince
Edmund
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
the
business
was
,
that
the
Pope
gave
the
Crown
to
the
brother
of
the
King
of
France
(
who
conquered
it
for
himself
)
,
and
sent
the
King
of
England
in
,
a
bill
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
for
the
expenses
of
not
having
won
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
was
now
so
much
distressed
that
we
might
almost
pity
him
,
if
it
were
possible
to
pity
a
King
so
shabby
and
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
His
clever
brother
,
Richard
,
had
bought
the
title
of
King
of
the
Romans
from
the
German
people
,
and
was
no
longer
near
him
,
to
help
him
with
advice
.
 
<EOS>
The
clergy
,
resisting
the
very
Pope
,
were
in
alliance
with
the
Barons
.
 
<EOS>
The
Barons
were
headed
by
SIMON
DE
MONTFORT
,
Earl
of
Leicester
,
married
to
King
Henry
's
sister
,
and
,
though
a
foreigner
himself
,
the
most
popular
man
in
England
against
the
foreign
favourites
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
next
met
his
Parliament
,
the
Barons
,
led
by
this
Earl
,
came
before
him
,
armed
from
head
to
foot
,
and
cased
in
armour
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Parliament
again
assembled
,
in
a
month
's
time
,
at
Oxford
,
this
Earl
was
at
their
head
,
and
the
King
was
obliged
to
consent
,
on
oath
,
to
what
was
called
a
Committee
of
Government
:
 
consisting
of
twenty
-
four
members
:
 
twelve
chosen
by
the
Barons
,
and
twelve
chosen
by
himself
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
at
a
good
time
for
him
,
his
brother
Richard
came
back
.
<EOS>
Richard
's
first
act
(
the
Barons
would
not
admit
him
into
England
on
other
terms
)
was
to
swear
to
be
faithful
to
the
Committee
of
Government
---
which
he
immediately
began
to
oppose
with
all
his
might
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Barons
began
to
quarrel
among
themselves
;
especially
the
proud
Earl
of
Gloucester
with
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
who
went
abroad
in
disgust
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
people
began
to
be
dissatisfied
with
the
Barons
,
because
they
did
not
do
enough
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
chances
seemed
so
good
again
at
length
,
that
he
took
heart
enough
---
or
caught
it
from
his
brother
---
to
tell
the
Committee
of
Government
that
he
abolished
them
---
as
to
his
oath
,
never
mind
that
,
the
Pope
said
!
<EOS>
---
and
to
seize
all
the
money
in
the
Mint
,
and
to
shut
himself
up
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
Here
he
was
joined
by
his
eldest
son
,
Prince
Edward
;
and
,
from
the
Tower
,
he
made
public
a
letter
of
the
Pope
's
to
the
world
in
general
,
informing
all
men
that
he
had
been
an
excellent
and
just
King
for
five
-
and
-
forty
years
.
  
<EOS>
As
everybody
knew
he
had
been
nothing
of
the
sort
,
nobody
cared
much
for
this
document
.
 
<EOS>
It
so
chanced
that
the
proud
Earl
of
Gloucester
dying
,
was
succeeded
by
his
son
;
and
that
his
son
,
instead
of
being
the
enemy
of
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
was
(
for
the
time
)
<EOS>
his
friend
.
 
<EOS>
It
fell
out
,
therefore
,
that
these
two
Earls
joined
their
forces
,
took
several
of
the
Royal
Castles
in
the
country
,
and
advanced
as
hard
as
they
could
on
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
London
people
,
always
opposed
to
the
King
,
declared
for
them
with
great
joy
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
himself
remained
shut
up
,
not
at
all
gloriously
,
in
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Edward
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
,
the
Queen
,
attempted
to
follow
him
by
water
;
but
,
the
people
seeing
her
barge
rowing
up
the
river
,
and
hating
her
with
all
their
hearts
,
ran
to
London
Bridge
,
got
together
a
quantity
of
stones
and
mud
,
and
pelted
the
barge
as
it
came
through
,
crying
furiously
,
"
Drown
the
Witch
!
 
<EOS>
Drown
her
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
near
doing
it
,
that
the
Mayor
took
the
old
lady
under
his
protection
,
and
shut
her
up
in
St
Paul
's
until
the
danger
was
past
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
require
a
great
deal
of
writing
on
my
part
,
and
a
great
deal
of
reading
on
yours
,
to
follow
the
King
through
his
disputes
with
the
Barons
,
and
to
follow
the
Barons
through
their
disputes
with
one
another
---
<EOS>
so
I
will
make
short
work
of
it
for
both
of
us
,
and
only
relate
the
chief
events
that
arose
out
of
these
quarrels
.
<EOS>
The
good
King
of
France
was
asked
to
decide
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
it
as
his
opinion
that
the
King
must
maintain
the
Great
Charter
,
and
that
the
Barons
must
give
up
the
Committee
of
Government
,
and
all
the
rest
that
had
been
done
by
the
Parliament
at
Oxford
:
 
which
the
Royalists
,
or
King
's
party
,
scornfully
called
the
Mad
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
The
Barons
declared
that
these
were
not
fair
terms
,
and
they
would
not
accept
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
caused
the
great
bell
of
St
Paul
's
to
be
tolled
,
for
the
purpose
of
rousing
up
the
London
people
,
who
armed
themselves
at
the
dismal
sound
and
formed
quite
an
army
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
however
,
that
instead
of
falling
upon
the
King
's
party
with
whom
their
quarrel
was
,
they
fell
upon
the
miserable
Jews
,
and
killed
at
least
five
hundred
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
They
pretended
that
some
of
these
Jews
were
on
the
King
's
side
,
and
that
they
kept
hidden
in
their
houses
,
for
the
destruction
of
the
people
,
a
certain
terrible
composition
called
Greek
Fire
,
which
could
not
be
put
out
with
water
,
but
only
burnt
the
fiercer
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
really
did
keep
in
their
houses
was
money
;
and
this
their
cruel
enemies
wanted
,
and
this
their
cruel
enemies
took
,
like
robbers
and
murderers
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Leicester
put
himself
at
the
head
of
these
Londoners
and
other
forces
,
and
followed
the
King
to
Lewes
in
Sussex
,
where
he
lay
encamped
with
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
Before
giving
the
King
's
forces
battle
here
,
the
Earl
addressed
his
soldiers
,
and
said
that
King
Henry
the
Third
had
broken
so
many
oaths
,
that
he
had
become
the
enemy
of
God
,
and
therefore
they
would
wear
white
crosses
on
their
breasts
,
as
if
they
were
arrayed
,
not
against
a
fellow
-
Christian
,
but
against
a
Turk
.
 
<EOS>
White
-
crossed
accordingly
,
they
rushed
into
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
They
would
have
lost
the
day
---
the
King
having
on
his
side
all
the
foreigners
in
England
:
 
and
,
from
Scotland
,
JOHN
COMYN
,
JOHN
BALIOL
,
and
ROBERT
BRUCE
,
with
all
their
men
---
but
for
the
impatience
of
PRINCE
EDWARD
,
who
,
in
his
hot
desire
to
have
vengeance
on
the
people
of
London
,
threw
the
whole
of
his
father
's
army
into
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
Prisoner
;
so
was
the
King
;
so
was
the
King
's
brother
the
King
of
the
Romans
;
and
five
thousand
Englishmen
were
left
dead
upon
the
bloody
grass
.
  
<EOS>
For
this
success
,
the
Pope
excommunicated
the
Earl
of
Leicester
:
which
neither
the
Earl
nor
the
people
cared
at
all
about
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
loved
him
and
supported
him
,
and
he
became
the
real
King
;
having
all
the
power
of
the
government
in
his
own
hands
,
though
he
was
outwardly
respectful
to
King
Henry
the
Third
,
whom
he
took
with
him
wherever
he
went
,
like
a
poor
old
limp
court
-
card
.
 
<EOS>
He
summoned
a
Parliament
(
in
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
sixty
-
five
)
which
was
the
first
Parliament
in
England
that
the
people
had
any
real
share
in
electing
;
and
he
grew
more
and
more
in
favour
with
the
people
every
day
,
and
they
stood
by
him
in
whatever
he
did
.
  
<EOS>
Many
of
the
other
Barons
,
and
particularly
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
who
had
become
by
this
time
as
proud
as
his
father
,
grew
jealous
of
this
powerful
and
popular
Earl
,
who
was
proud
too
,
and
began
to
conspire
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Since
the
battle
of
Lewes
,
Prince
Edward
had
been
kept
as
a
hostage
,
and
,
though
he
was
otherwise
treated
like
a
Prince
,
had
never
been
allowed
to
go
out
without
attendants
appointed
by
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
who
watched
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
conspiring
Lords
found
means
to
propose
to
him
,
in
secret
,
that
they
should
assist
him
to
escape
,
and
should
make
him
their
leader
;
to
which
he
very
heartily
consented
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
on
a
day
that
was
agreed
upon
,
he
said
to
his
attendants
after
dinner
(
being
then
at
Hereford
)
,
"
I
should
like
to
ride
on
horseback
,
this
fine
afternoon
,
a
little
way
into
the
country
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
they
,
too
,
thought
it
would
be
very
pleasant
to
have
a
canter
in
the
sunshine
,
they
all
rode
out
of
the
town
together
in
a
gay
little
troop
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
a
fine
level
piece
of
turf
,
the
Prince
fell
to
comparing
their
horses
one
with
another
,
and
offering
bets
that
one
was
faster
than
another
;
and
the
attendants
,
suspecting
no
harm
,
rode
galloping
matches
until
their
horses
were
quite
tired
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
rode
no
matches
himself
,
but
looked
on
from
his
saddle
,
and
staked
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
they
passed
the
whole
merry
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
sun
was
setting
,
and
they
were
all
going
slowly
up
a
hill
,
the
Prince
's
horse
very
fresh
and
<EOS>
all
the
other
horses
very
weary
,
when
a
strange
rider
mounted
on
a
grey
steed
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
hill
,
and
waved
his
hat
.
 
<EOS>
"
What
does
the
fellow
mean
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
attendants
one
to
another
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
answered
on
the
instant
by
setting
spurs
to
his
horse
,
dashing
away
at
his
utmost
speed
,
joining
the
man
,
riding
into
the
midst
of
a
little
crowd
of
horsemen
who
were
then
seen
waiting
under
some
trees
,
and
who
closed
around
him
;
and
so
he
departed
in
a
cloud
of
dust
,
leaving
the
road
empty
of
all
but
the
baffled
attendants
,
who
sat
looking
at
one
another
,
while
their
horses
drooped
their
ears
and
panted
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
joined
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
at
Ludlow
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Leicester
,
with
a
part
of
the
army
and
the
stupid
old
King
,
was
at
Hereford
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
Earl
of
Leicester
's
sons
,
Simon
de
Montfort
,
with
another
part
of
the
army
,
was
in
Sussex
.
 
<EOS>
To
prevent
these
two
parts
from
uniting
was
the
Prince
's
first
object
.
 
<EOS>
He
attacked
Simon
de
Montfort
by
night
,
defeated
him
,
seized
his
banners
and
treasure
,
and
forced
him
into
Kenilworth
Castle
in
Warwickshire
,
which
belonged
to
his
family
.
  
<EOS>
His
father
,
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
not
knowing
what
had
happened
,
marched
out
of
Hereford
,
with
his
part
of
the
army
and
the
King
,
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
,
on
a
bright
morning
in
August
,
to
Evesham
,
which
is
watered
by
the
pleasant
river
Avon
.
<EOS>
Looking
rather
anxiously
across
the
prospect
towards
Kenilworth
,
he
saw
his
own
banners
advancing
;
and
his
face
brightened
with
joy
.
<EOS>
But
,
it
clouded
darkly
when
he
presently
perceived
that
the
banners
were
captured
,
and
in
the
enemy
's
hands
;
and
he
said
,
"
It
is
over
.
<EOS>
The
Lord
have
mercy
on
our
souls
,
for
our
bodies
are
Prince
Edward
's
!
"
  
<EOS>
He
fought
like
a
true
Knight
,
nevertheless
.
 
<EOS>
When
his
horse
was
killed
under
him
,
he
fought
on
foot
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
fierce
battle
,
and
the
dead
lay
in
heaps
everywhere
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
King
,
stuck
up
in
a
suit
of
armour
on
a
big
war
-
horse
,
which
did
n't
mind
him
at
all
,
and
which
carried
him
into
all
sorts
of
places
where
he
did
n't
want
to
go
,
got
into
everybody
's
way
,
and
very
nearly
got
knocked
on
the
head
by
one
of
his
son
's
men
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
managed
to
pipe
out
,
"
I
am
Harry
of
Winchester
!
"
and
the
Prince
,
who
heard
him
,
seized
his
bridle
,
and
took
him
out
of
peril
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Leicester
still
fought
bravely
,
until
his
best
son
Henry
was
killed
,
and
the
bodies
of
his
best
friends
choked
his
path
;
and
then
he
fell
,
still
fighting
,
sword
in
hand
.
 
<EOS>
They
mangled
his
body
,
and
sent
it
as
a
present
to
a
noble
lady
---
but
a
very
unpleasant
lady
,
I
should
think
---
<EOS>
who
was
the
wife
of
his
worst
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
not
mangle
his
memory
in
the
minds
of
the
faithful
people
,
though
.
 
<EOS>
Many
years
afterwards
,
they
loved
him
more
than
ever
,
and
regarded
him
as
a
Saint
,
and
always
spoke
of
him
as
"
Sir
Simon
the
Righteous
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
And
even
though
he
was
dead
,
the
cause
for
which
he
had
fought
still
lived
,
and
was
strong
,
and
forced
itself
upon
the
King
in
the
very
hour
of
victory
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
found
himself
obliged
to
respect
the
Great
Charter
,
however
much
he
hated
it
,
and
to
make
laws
similar
to
the
laws
of
the
Great
Earl
of
Leicester
,
and
to
be
moderate
and
forgiving
towards
the
people
at
last
---
even
towards
the
people
of
London
,
who
had
so
long
opposed
him
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
more
risings
before
all
this
was
done
,
but
they
were
set
at
rest
by
these
means
,
and
Prince
Edward
did
his
best
in
all
things
to
restore
peace
.
 
<EOS>
One
Sir
Adam
de
Gourdon
was
the
last
dissatisfied
knight
in
arms
;
but
,
the
Prince
vanquished
him
in
single
combat
,
in
a
wood
,
and
nobly
gave
him
his
life
,
and
became
his
friend
,
instead
of
slaying
him
.
<EOS>
Sir
Adam
was
not
ungrateful
.
 
<EOS>
He
ever
afterwards
remained
devoted
to
his
generous
conqueror
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
troubles
of
the
Kingdom
were
thus
calmed
,
Prince
Edward
and
his
cousin
Henry
took
the
Cross
,
and
went
away
to
the
Holy
Land
,
with
many
English
Lords
and
Knights
.
 
<EOS>
Four
years
afterwards
the
King
of
the
Romans
died
,
and
,
next
year
(
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
)
,
his
brother
the
weak
King
of
England
died
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sixty
-
eight
years
old
then
,
and
had
reigned
fifty
-
six
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
as
much
of
a
King
in
death
,
as
he
had
ever
been
in
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
the
mere
pale
shadow
of
a
King
at
all
times
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
First
,
Called
Longshanks
    
IT
was
now
the
year
of
our
Lord
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
;
and
Prince
Edward
,
the
heir
to
the
throne
,
being
away
in
the
Holy
Land
,
knew
nothing
of
his
father
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
Barons
,
however
,
proclaimed
him
King
,
immediately
after
the
Royal
funeral
;
and
the
people
very
willingly
consented
,
since
most
men
knew
too
well
by
this
time
what
the
horrors
of
a
contest
for
the
crown
were
.
<EOS>
So
King
Edward
the
First
,
called
,
in
a
not
very
complimentary
manner
,
LONGSHANKS
,
because
of
the
slenderness
of
his
legs
,
was
peacefully
accepted
by
the
English
Nation
.
  
<EOS>
His
legs
had
need
to
be
strong
,
however
long
and
thin
they
were
;
for
they
had
to
support
him
through
many
difficulties
on
the
fiery
sands
of
Asia
,
where
his
small
force
of
soldiers
fainted
,
died
,
deserted
,
and
seemed
to
melt
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
prowess
made
light
of
it
,
and
he
said
,
"
I
will
go
on
,
if
I
go
on
with
no
other
follower
than
my
groom
!
"
  
<EOS>
A
Prince
of
this
spirit
gave
the
Turks
a
deal
of
trouble
.
 
<EOS>
He
stormed
Nazareth
,
at
which
place
,
of
all
places
on
earth
,
I
am
sorry
to
relate
,
he
made
a
frightful
slaughter
of
innocent
people
;
and
then
he
went
to
Acre
,
where
he
got
a
truce
of
ten
years
from
the
Sultan
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
very
nearly
lost
his
life
in
Acre
,
through
the
treachery
of
a
Saracen
Noble
,
called
the
Emir
of
Jaffa
,
who
,
making
the
pretence
that
he
had
some
idea
of
turning
Christian
and
wanted
to
know
all
about
that
religion
,
sent
a
trusty
messenger
to
Edward
very
often
---
with
a
dagger
in
his
sleeve
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
Friday
in
Whitsun
week
,
when
it
was
very
hot
,
and
all
the
sandy
prospect
lay
beneath
the
blazing
sun
,
burnt
up
like
a
great
overdone
biscuit
,
and
Edward
was
lying
on
a
couch
,
dressed
for
coolness
in
only
a
loose
robe
,
the
messenger
,
with
his
chocolate
-
coloured
face
and
his
bright
dark
eyes
and
white
teeth
,
came
creeping
in
with
a
letter
,
and
kneeled
down
like
a
tame
tiger
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
moment
Edward
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
the
letter
,
the
tiger
made
a
spring
at
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quick
,
but
Edward
was
quick
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
seized
the
traitor
by
his
chocolate
throat
,
threw
him
to
the
ground
,
and
slew
him
with
the
very
dagger
he
had
drawn
.
 
<EOS>
The
weapon
had
struck
Edward
in
the
arm
,
and
although
the
wound
itself
was
slight
,
it
threatened
to
be
mortal
,
for
the
blade
of
the
dagger
had
been
smeared
with
poison
.
 
<EOS>
Thanks
,
however
,
to
a
better
surgeon
than
was
often
to
be
found
in
those
times
,
and
to
some
wholesome
herbs
,
and
above
all
,
to
his
faithful
wife
,
ELEANOR
,
who
devotedly
nursed
him
,
and
is
said
by
some
to
have
sucked
the
poison
from
the
wound
with
her
own
red
lips
(
which
I
am
very
willing
to
believe
)
,
Edward
soon
recovered
and
was
sound
again
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
King
his
father
had
sent
entreaties
to
him
to
return
home
,
he
now
began
the
journey
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
got
as
far
as
Italy
,
when
he
met
messengers
who
brought
him
intelligence
of
the
King
's
death
.
<EOS>
Hearing
that
all
was
quiet
at
home
,
he
made
no
haste
to
return
to
his
own
dominions
,
but
paid
a
visit
to
the
Pope
,
and
went
in
state
through
various
Italian
Towns
,
where
he
was
welcomed
with
acclamations
as
a
mighty
champion
of
the
Cross
from
the
Holy
Land
,
and
where
he
received
presents
of
purple
mantles
and
prancing
horses
,
and
went
along
in
great
triumph
.
 
<EOS>
The
shouting
people
little
knew
that
he
was
the
last
English
monarch
who
would
ever
embark
in
a
crusade
,
or
that
within
twenty
years
every
conquest
which
the
Christians
had
made
in
the
Holy
Land
at
the
cost
of
so
much
blood
,
would
be
won
back
by
the
Turks
.
 
<EOS>
But
all
this
came
to
pass
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
,
and
there
is
,
an
old
town
standing
in
a
plain
in
France
,
called
ChÉlons
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
was
coming
towards
this
place
on
his
way
to
England
,
a
wily
French
Lord
,
called
the
Count
of
ChÉlons
,
sent
him
a
polite
challenge
to
come
with
his
knights
and
hold
a
fair
tournament
with
the
Count
and
HIS
knights
,
and
make
a
day
of
it
with
sword
and
lance
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
represented
to
the
King
that
the
Count
of
ChÉlons
was
not
to
be
trusted
,
and
that
,
instead
of
a
holiday
fight
for
mere
show
and
in
good
humour
,
he
secretly
meant
a
real
battle
,
in
which
the
English
should
be
defeated
by
superior
force
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
however
,
nothing
afraid
,
went
to
the
appointed
place
on
the
appointed
day
with
a
thousand
followers
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Count
came
with
two
thousand
and
attacked
the
English
in
earnest
,
the
English
rushed
at
them
with
such
valour
that
the
Count
's
men
and
the
Count
's
horses
soon
began
to
be
tumbled
down
all
over
the
field
.
<EOS>
The
Count
himself
seized
the
King
round
the
neck
,
but
the
King
tumbled
HIM
out
of
his
saddle
in
return
for
the
compliment
,
and
,
jumping
from
his
own
horse
,
and
standing
over
him
,
beat
away
at
his
iron
armour
like
a
blacksmith
hammering
on
his
anvil
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
the
Count
owned
himself
defeated
and
offered
his
sword
,
the
King
would
not
do
him
the
honour
to
take
it
,
but
made
him
yield
it
up
to
a
common
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
such
fury
shown
in
this
fight
,
that
it
was
afterwards
called
the
little
Battle
of
ChÉlons
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
were
very
well
disposed
to
be
proud
of
their
King
after
these
adventures
;
so
,
when
he
landed
at
Dover
in
the
year
one
thousand
two
hundred
and
seventy
-
four
(
being
then
thirty
-
six
years
old
)
,
and
went
on
to
Westminster
where
he
and
his
good
Queen
were
crowned
with
great
magnificence
,
splendid
rejoicings
took
place
.
<EOS>
For
the
coronation
-
feast
there
were
provided
,
among
other
eatables
,
four
hundred
oxen
,
four
hundred
sheep
,
four
hundred
and
fifty
pigs
,
eighteen
wild
boars
,
three
hundred
flitches
of
bacon
,
and
twenty
thousand
fowls
.
 
<EOS>
The
fountains
and
conduits
in
the
street
flowed
with
red
and
white
wine
instead
of
water
;
the
rich
citizens
hung
silks
and
cloths
of
the
brightest
colours
out
of
their
windows
to
increase
the
beauty
of
the
show
,
and
threw
out
gold
and
silver
by
whole
handfuls
to
make
scrambles
for
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
there
was
such
eating
and
drinking
,
such
music
and
capering
,
such
a
ringing
of
bells
and
tossing
of
caps
,
such
a
shouting
,
and
singing
,
and
revelling
,
as
the
narrow
overhanging
streets
of
old
London
City
had
not
witnessed
for
many
a
long
day
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
people
were
merry
except
the
poor
Jews
,
who
,
trembling
within
their
houses
,
and
scarcely
daring
to
peep
out
,
began
to
foresee
that
they
would
have
to
find
the
money
for
this
joviality
sooner
or
later
.
  
<EOS>
To
dismiss
this
sad
subject
of
the
Jews
for
the
present
,
I
am
sorry
to
add
that
in
this
reign
they
were
most
unmercifully
pillaged
.
<EOS>
They
were
hanged
in
great
numbers
,
on
accusations
of
having
clipped
the
King
's
coin
---
which
all
kinds
of
people
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
heavily
taxed
;
they
were
disgracefully
badged
;
they
were
,
on
one
day
,
thirteen
years
after
the
coronation
,
taken
up
with
their
wives
and
children
and
thrown
into
beastly
prisons
,
until
they
purchased
their
release
by
paying
to
the
King
twelve
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
every
kind
of
property
belonging
to
them
was
seized
by
the
King
,
except
so
little
as
would
defray
the
charge
of
their
taking
themselves
away
into
foreign
countries
.
 
<EOS>
Many
years
elapsed
before
the
hope
of
gain
induced
any
of
their
race
to
return
to
England
,
where
they
had
been
treated
so
heartlessly
and
had
suffered
so
much
.
  
<EOS>
If
King
Edward
the
First
had
been
as
bad
a
king
to
Christians
as
he
was
to
Jews
,
he
would
have
been
bad
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
,
in
general
,
a
wise
and
great
monarch
,
under
whom
the
country
much
improved
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
no
love
for
the
Great
Charter
---
few
Kings
had
,
through
many
,
many
years
---
but
he
had
high
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
bold
object
which
he
conceived
when
he
came
home
,
was
,
to
unite
under
one
Sovereign
England
,
Scotland
,
and
Wales
;
the
two
last
of
which
countries
had
each
a
little
king
of
its
own
,
about
whom
the
people
were
always
quarrelling
and
fighting
,
and
making
a
prodigious
disturbance
---
a
great
deal
more
than
he
was
worth
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
King
Edward
's
reign
he
was
engaged
,
besides
,
in
a
war
with
France
.
 
<EOS>
To
make
these
quarrels
clearer
,
we
will
separate
their
histories
and
take
them
thus
.
 
<EOS>
Wales
,
first
.
 
<EOS>
France
,
second
.
<EOS>
Scotland
,
third

<EOS>
LLEWELLYN
was
the
Prince
of
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
on
the
side
of
the
Barons
in
the
reign
of
the
stupid
old
King
,
but
had
afterwards
sworn
allegiance
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
King
Edward
came
to
the
throne
,
Llewellyn
was
required
to
swear
allegiance
to
him
also
;
which
he
refused
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
being
crowned
and
in
his
own
dominions
,
three
times
more
required
Llewellyn
to
come
and
do
homage
;
and
three
times
more
Llewellyn
said
he
would
rather
not
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
going
to
be
married
to
ELEANOR
DE
MONTFORT
,
a
young
lady
of
the
family
mentioned
in
the
last
reign
;
and
it
chanced
that
this
young
lady
,
coming
from
France
with
her
youngest
brother
,
EMERIC
,
was
taken
by
an
English
ship
,
and
was
ordered
by
the
English
King
to
be
detained
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
quarrel
came
to
a
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
went
,
with
his
fleet
,
to
the
coast
of
Wales
,
where
,
so
encompassing
Llewellyn
,
that
he
could
only
take
refuge
in
the
bleak
mountain
region
of
Snowdon
in
which
no
provisions
could
reach
him
,
he
was
soon
starved
into
an
apology
,
and
into
a
treaty
of
peace
,
and
into
paying
the
expenses
of
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
however
,
forgave
him
some
of
the
hardest
conditions
of
the
treaty
,
and
consented
to
his
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
now
thought
he
had
reduced
Wales
to
obedience
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Welsh
,
although
they
were
naturally
a
gentle
,
quiet
,
pleasant
people
,
who
liked
to
receive
strangers
in
their
cottages
among
the
mountains
,
and
to
set
before
them
with
free
hospitality
whatever
they
had
to
eat
and
drink
,
and
to
play
to
them
on
their
harps
,
and
sing
their
native
ballads
to
them
,
were
a
people
of
great
spirit
when
their
blood
was
up
.
 
<EOS>
Englishmen
,
after
this
affair
,
began
to
be
insolent
in
Wales
,
and
to
assume
the
air
of
masters
;
and
the
Welsh
pride
could
not
bear
it
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
they
believed
in
that
unlucky
old
Merlin
,
some
of
whose
unlucky
old
prophecies
somebody
always
seemed
doomed
to
remember
when
there
was
a
chance
of
its
doing
harm
;
and
just
at
this
time
some
blind
old
gentleman
with
a
harp
and
a
long
white
beard
,
who
was
an
excellent
person
,
but
had
become
of
an
unknown
age
and
tedious
,
burst
out
with
a
declaration
that
Merlin
had
predicted
that
when
English
money
had
become
round
,
a
Prince
of
Wales
would
be
crowned
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
King
Edward
had
recently
forbidden
the
English
penny
to
be
cut
into
halves
and
quarters
for
halfpence
and
farthings
,
and
had
actually
introduced
a
round
coin
;
therefore
,
the
Welsh
people
said
this
was
the
time
Merlin
meant
,
and
rose
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
had
bought
over
PRINCE
DAVID
,
Llewellyn
's
brother
,
by
heaping
favours
upon
him
;
but
he
was
the
first
to
revolt
,
being
perhaps
troubled
in
his
conscience
.
 
<EOS>
One
stormy
night
,
he
surprised
the
Castle
of
Hawarden
,
in
possession
of
which
an
English
nobleman
had
been
left
;
killed
the
whole
garrison
,
and
carried
off
the
nobleman
a
prisoner
to
Snowdon
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
Welsh
people
rose
like
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
with
his
army
,
marching
from
Worcester
to
the
Menai
Strait
,
crossed
it
---
near
to
where
the
wonderful
tubular
iron
bridge
now
,
in
days
so
different
,
makes
a
passage
for
railway
trains
---
by
a
bridge
of
boats
that
enabled
forty
men
to
march
abreast
.
 
<EOS>
He
subdued
the
Island
of
Anglesea
,
and
sent
his
men
forward
to
observe
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
The
sudden
appearance
of
the
Welsh
created
a
panic
among
them
,
and
they
fell
back
to
the
bridge
.
 
<EOS>
The
tide
had
in
the
meantime
risen
and
separated
the
boats
;
the
Welsh
pursuing
them
,
they
were
driven
into
the
sea
,
and
there
they
sunk
,
in
their
heavy
iron
armour
,
by
thousands
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
victory
Llewellyn
,
helped
by
the
severe
winter
-
weather
of
Wales
,
gained
another
battle
;
but
the
King
ordering
a
portion
of
his
English
army
to
advance
through
South
Wales
,
and
catch
him
between
two
foes
,
and
Llewellyn
bravely
turning
to
meet
this
new
enemy
,
he
was
surprised
and
killed
---
very
meanly
,
for
he
was
unarmed
and
defenceless
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
was
struck
off
and
sent
to
London
,
where
it
was
fixed
upon
the
Tower
,
encircled
with
a
wreath
,
some
say
of
ivy
,
some
say
of
willow
,
some
say
of
silver
,
to
make
it
look
like
a
ghastly
coin
in
ridicule
of
the
prediction
.
  
<EOS>
David
,
however
,
still
held
out
for
six
months
,
though
eagerly
sought
after
by
the
King
,
and
hunted
by
his
own
countrymen
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
finally
betrayed
him
with
his
wife
and
children
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
;
and
from
that
time
this
became
the
established
punishment
of
Traitors
in
England
---
a
punishment
wholly
without
excuse
,
as
being
revolting
,
vile
,
and
cruel
,
after
its
object
is
dead
;
and
which
has
no
sense
in
it
,
as
its
only
real
degradation
(
and
that
nothing
can
blot
out
)
is
to
the
country
that
permits
on
any
consideration
such
abominable
barbarity
.
  
<EOS>
Wales
was
now
subdued
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
giving
birth
to
a
young
prince
in
the
Castle
of
Carnarvon
,
the
King
showed
him
to
the
Welsh
people
as
their
countryman
,
and
called
him
Prince
of
Wales
;
a
title
that
has
ever
since
been
borne
by
the
heir
-
apparent
to
the
English
throne
---
which
that
little
Prince
soon
became
,
by
the
death
of
his
elder
brother
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
did
better
things
for
the
Welsh
than
that
,
by
improving
their
laws
and
encouraging
their
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Disturbances
still
took
place
,
chiefly
occasioned
by
the
avarice
and
pride
of
the
English
Lords
,
on
whom
Welsh
lands
and
castles
had
been
bestowed
;
but
they
were
subdued
,
and
the
country
never
rose
again
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
legend
that
to
prevent
the
people
from
being
incited
to
rebellion
by
the
songs
of
their
bards
and
harpers
,
Edward
had
them
all
put
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
may
have
fallen
among
other
men
who
held
out
against
the
King
;
but
this
general
slaughter
is
,
I
think
,
a
fancy
of
the
harpers
themselves
,
who
,
I
dare
say
,
made
a
song
about
it
<EOS>
many
years
afterwards
,
and
sang
it
by
the
Welsh
firesides
until
it
came
to
be
believed
.
  
<EOS>
The
foreign
war
of
the
reign
of
Edward
the
First
arose
in
this
way
.
<EOS>
The
crews
of
two
vessels
,
one
a
Norman
ship
,
and
the
other
an
English
ship
,
happened
to
go
to
the
same
place
in
their
boats
to
fill
their
casks
with
fresh
water
.
 
<EOS>
Being
rough
angry
fellows
,
they
began
to
quarrel
,
and
then
to
fight
---
the
English
with
their
fists
;
the
Normans
with
their
knives
---
and
,
in
the
fight
,
a
Norman
was
killed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Norman
crew
,
instead
of
revenging
themselves
upon
those
English
sailors
with
whom
they
had
quarrelled
(
who
were
too
strong
for
them
,
I
suspect
)
,
took
to
their
ship
again
in
a
great
rage
,
attacked
the
first
English
ship
they
met
,
laid
hold
of
an
unoffending
merchant
who
happened
to
be
on
board
,
and
brutally
hanged
him
in
the
rigging
of
their
own
vessel
with
a
dog
at
his
feet
.
 
<EOS>
This
so
enraged
the
English
sailors
that
there
was
no
restraining
them
;
and
whenever
,
and
wherever
,
English
sailors
met
Norman
sailors
,
they
fell
upon
each
other
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
The
Irish
and
Dutch
sailors
took
part
with
the
English
;
the
French
and
Genoese
sailors
helped
the
Normans
;
and
thus
the
greater
part
of
the
mariners
sailing
over
the
sea
became
,
in
their
way
,
as
violent
and
raging
as
the
sea
itself
when
it
is
disturbed
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
's
fame
had
been
so
high
abroad
that
he
had
been
chosen
to
decide
a
difference
between
France
and
another
foreign
power
,
and
had
lived
upon
the
Continent
three
years
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
neither
he
nor
the
French
King
PHILIP
(
the
good
Louis
had
been
dead
some
time
)
interfered
in
these
quarrels
;
but
when
a
fleet
of
eighty
English
ships
engaged
and
utterly
defeated
a
Norman
fleet
of
two
hundred
,
in
a
pitched
battle
fought
round
a
ship
at
anchor
,
in
which
no
quarter
was
given
,
the
matter
became
too
serious
to
be
passed
over
.
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
as
Duke
of
Guienne
,
was
summoned
to
present
himself
before
the
King
of
France
,
at
Paris
,
and
answer
for
the
damage
done
by
his
sailor
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
sent
the
Bishop
of
London
as
his
representative
,
and
then
his
brother
EDMUND
,
who
was
married
to
the
French
Queen
's
mother
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
Edmund
was
an
easy
man
,
and
allowed
himself
to
be
talked
over
by
his
charming
relations
,
the
French
court
ladies
;
at
all
events
,
he
was
induced
to
give
up
his
brother
's
dukedom
for
forty
days
---
as
a
mere
form
,
the
French
King
said
,
to
satisfy
his
honour
---
<EOS>
and
he
was
so
very
much
astonished
,
when
the
time
was
out
,
to
find
that
the
French
King
had
no
idea
of
giving
it
up
again
,
that
I
should
not
wonder
if
it
hastened
his
death
:
 
<EOS>
which
soon
took
place
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
was
a
King
to
win
his
foreign
dukedom
back
again
,
if
it
could
be
won
by
energy
and
valour
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
a
large
army
,
renounced
his
allegiance
as
Duke
of
Guienne
,
and
crossed
the
sea
to
carry
war
into
France
.
 
<EOS>
Before
any
important
battle
was
fought
,
however
,
a
truce
was
agreed
upon
for
two
years
;
and
in
the
course
of
that
time
,
the
Pope
effected
a
reconciliation
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
who
was
now
a
widower
,
having
lost
his
affectionate
and
good
wife
,
Eleanor
,
married
the
French
King
's
sister
,
MARGARET
;
and
the
Prince
of
Wales
was
contracted
to
the
French
King
's
daughter
ISABELLA
.
  
<EOS>
Out
of
bad
things
,
good
things
sometimes
arise
.
 
<EOS>
Out
of
this
hanging
of
the
innocent
merchant
,
and
the
bloodshed
and
strife
it
caused
,
there
came
to
be
established
one
of
the
greatest
powers
that
the
English
people
now
possess
.
 
<EOS>
The
preparations
for
the
war
being
very
expensive
,
and
King
Edward
greatly
wanting
money
,
and
being
very
arbitrary
in
his
ways
of
raising
it
,
some
of
the
Barons
began
firmly
to
oppose
him
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
them
,
in
particular
,
HUMPHREY
BOHUN
,
Earl
of
Hereford
,
and
ROGER
BIGOD
,
Earl
of
Norfolk
,
were
so
stout
against
him
,
that
they
maintained
he
had
no
right
to
command
them
to
head
his
forces
in
Guienne
,
and
flatly
refused
to
go
there
.

Sir
Earl
,
"
said
the
King
to
the
Earl
of
Hereford
,
in
a
great
passion
,
"
you
shall
either
go
or
be
hanged
!
"
 
<EOS>
"
By
Heaven
,
Sir
King
,
"
replied
the
Earl
,
"
I
will
neither
go
nor
yet
will
I
be
hanged
!
"
<EOS>
and
both
he
and
the
other
Earl
sturdily
left
the
court
,
attended
by
many
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
tried
every
means
of
raising
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
taxed
the
clergy
,
in
spite
of
all
the
Pope
<EOS>
said
to
the
contrary
;
and
when
they
refused
to
pay
,
reduced
them
to
submission
,
by
saying
<EOS>
Very
well
,
then
they
had
no
claim
upon
the
government
for
protection
,
and
any
man
might
plunder
them
who
would
---
which
a
good
many
men
were
very
ready
to
do
,
and
very
readily
did
,
and
which
the
clergy
found
too
losing
a
game
to
be
played
at
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
seized
all
the
wool
and
leather
in
the
hands
of
the
merchants
,
promising
to
pay
for
it
some
fine
day
;
and
he
set
a
tax
upon
the
exportation
of
wool
,
which
was
so
unpopular
among
the
traders
that
it
was
called
"
The
evil
toll
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
all
would
not
do
.
 
<EOS>
The
Barons
,
led
by
those
two
great
Earls
,
declared
any
taxes
imposed
without
the
consent
of
Parliament
,
unlawful
;
and
the
Parliament
refused
to
impose
taxes
,
until
the
King
should
confirm
afresh
the
two
Great
Charters
,
and
should
solemnly
declare
in
writing
,
that
there
was
no
power
in
the
country
to
raise
money
from
the
people
,
evermore
,
but
the
power
of
Parliament
representing
all
ranks
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
very
unwilling
to
diminish
his
own
power
by
allowing
this
great
privilege
in
the
Parliament
;
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
and
he
at
last
complied
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
come
to
another
King
by
-
and
-
by
,
who
might
have
saved
his
head
from
rolling
off
,
if
he
had
profited
by
this
example
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
gained
other
benefits
in
Parliament
from
the
good
sense
and
wisdom
of
this
King
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
laws
were
much
improved
;
provision
was
made
for
the
greater
safety
of
travellers
,
and
the
apprehension
of
thieves
and
murderers
;
the
priests
were
prevented
from
holding
too
much
land
,
and
so
becoming
too
powerful
;
and
Justices
of
the
Peace
were
first
appointed
(
though
not
at
first
under
that
name
)
in
various
parts
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
we
come
to
Scotland
,
which
was
the
great
and
lasting
trouble
of
the
reign
of
King
Edward
the
First
.
  
<EOS>
About
thirteen
years
after
King
Edward
's
coronation
,
Alexander
the
Third
,
the
King
of
Scotland
,
died
of
a
fall
from
his
horse
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
married
to
Margaret
,
King
Edward
's
sister
.
 
<EOS>
All
their
children
being
dead
,
the
Scottish
crown
became
the
right
of
a
young
Princess
only
eight
years
old
,
the
daughter
of
ERIC
,
King
of
Norway
,
who
had
married
a
daughter
of
the
deceased
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
proposed
,
that
the
Maiden
of
Norway
,
as
this
Princess
was
called
,
should
be
engaged
to
be
married
to
his
eldest
son
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
as
she
was
coming
over
to
England
she
fell
sick
,
and
landing
on
one
of
the
Orkney
Islands
,
died
there
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
commotion
immediately
began
in
Scotland
,
where
as
many
as
thirteen
noisy
claimants
to
the
vacant
throne
started
up
and
made
a
general
confusion
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
being
much
renowned
for
his
sagacity
and
justice
<EOS>
,
it
seems
to
have
been
agreed
to
refer
the
dispute
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
accepted
the
trust
,
and
went
,
with
an
army
,
to
the
Border
-
land
where
England
and
Scotland
joined
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
called
upon
the
Scottish
gentlemen
to
meet
him
at
the
Castle
of
Norham
,
on
the
English
side
of
the
river
Tweed
;
and
to
that
Castle
they
came
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
before
he
would
take
any
step
in
the
business
,
he
required
those
Scottish
gentlemen
,
one
and
all
,
to
do
homage
to
him
as
their
superior
Lord
;
and
when
they
hesitated
,
he
said
,
"
By
holy
Edward
,
whose
crown
I
wear
,
I
will
have
my
rights
,
or
I
will
die
in
maintaining
them
!
"
<EOS>
The
Scottish
gentlemen
,
who
had
not
expected
this
,
were
disconcerted
,
and
asked
for
three
weeks
to
think
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
the
three
weeks
,
another
meeting
took
place
,
on
a
green
plain
on
the
Scottish
side
of
the
river
.
 
<EOS>
Of
all
the
competitors
for
the
Scottish
throne
,
there
were
only
two
who
had
any
real
claim
,
in
right
of
their
near
kindred
to
the
Royal
Family
.
<EOS>
These
were
JOHN
BALIOL
and
ROBERT
BRUCE
:
 
and
the
right
was
,
I
have
no
doubt
,
on
the
side
of
John
Baliol
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
particular
meeting
John
Baliol
was
not
present
,
but
Robert
Bruce
was
;
and
on
Robert
Bruce
being
formally
asked
whether
he
acknowledged
the
King
of
England
for
his
superior
lord
,
he
answered
,
plainly
and
distinctly
,
<EOS>
Yes
,
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
John
Baliol
appeared
,
and
said
the
same
.
<EOS>
This
point
settled
,
some
arrangements
were
made
for
inquiring
into
their
titles
.
  
<EOS>
The
inquiry
occupied
a
pretty
long
time
---
more
than
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
While
it
was
going
on
,
King
Edward
took
the
opportunity
of
making
a
journey
through
Scotland
,
and
calling
upon
the
Scottish
people
of
all
degrees
to
acknowledge
themselves
his
vassals
,
or
be
imprisoned
until
they
did
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meanwhile
,
Commissioners
were
appointed
to
conduct
the
inquiry
,
a
Parliament
was
held
at
Berwick
about
it
,
the
two
claimants
were
heard
at
full
length
,
and
there
was
a
vast
amount
of
talking
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
in
the
great
hall
of
the
Castle
of
Berwick
,
the
King
gave
judgment
in
favour
of
John
Baliol
:
 
who
,
consenting
to
receive
his
crown
by
the
King
of
England
's
favour
and
permission
,
was
crowned
at
Scone
,
in
an
old
stone
chair
which
had
been
used
for
ages
in
the
abbey
there
,
at
the
coronations
of
Scottish
Kings
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
King
Edward
caused
the
great
seal
of
Scotland
,
used
since
the
late
King
's
death
,
to
be
broken
in
four
pieces
,
and
placed
in
the
English
Treasury
;
and
considered
that
he
now
had
Scotland
(
according
to
the
common
saying
)
under
his
thumb
.
  
<EOS>
Scotland
had
a
strong
will
of
its
own
yet
,
however
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
,
determined
that
the
Scottish
King
should
not
forget
he
was
his
vassal
,
summoned
him
repeatedly
to
come
and
defend
himself
and
his
judges
before
the
English
Parliament
when
appeals
from
the
decisions
of
Scottish
courts
of
justice
were
being
heard
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
John
Baliol
,
who
had
no
great
heart
of
his
own
,
had
so
much
heart
put
into
him
by
the
brave
spirit
of
the
Scottish
people
,
who
took
this
as
a
national
insult
,
that
he
refused
to
come
any
more
.
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
King
further
required
him
to
help
him
in
his
war
abroad
(
which
was
then
in
progress
)
,
and
to
give
up
,
as
security
for
his
good
behaviour
in
future
,
the
three
strong
Scottish
Castles
of
Jedburgh
,
Roxburgh
,
and
Berwick
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
of
this
being
done
;
on
the
contrary
,
the
Scottish
people
concealing
their
King
among
their
mountains
in
the
Highlands
and
showing
a
determination
to
resist
;
Edward
marched
to
Berwick
with
an
army
of
thirty
thousand
foot
,
and
four
thousand
horse
;
took
the
Castle
,
and
slew
its
whole
garrison
,
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
town
as
well
---
men
,
women
,
and
children
.
<EOS>
LORD
WARRENNE
,
Earl
of
Surrey
,
then
went
on
to
the
Castle
of
Dunbar
,
before
which
a
battle
was
fought
,
and
the
whole
Scottish
army
defeated
with
great
slaughter
.
 
<EOS>
The
victory
being
complete
,
the
Earl
of
Surrey
was
left
as
guardian
of
Scotland
;
the
principal
offices
in
that
kingdom
were
given
to
Englishmen
;
the
more
powerful
Scottish
Nobles
were
obliged
to
come
and
live
in
England
;
the
Scottish
crown
and
sceptre
were
brought
away
;
and
even
the
old
stone
chair
was
carried
off
and
placed
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
where
you
may
see
it
now
.
 
<EOS>
Baliol
had
the
Tower
of
London
lent
him
for
a
residence
,
with
permission
to
range
about
within
a
circle
of
twenty
miles
.
 
<EOS>
Three
years
afterwards
he
was
allowed
to
go
to
Normandy
,
where
he
had
estates
,
and
where
he
passed
the
remaining
six
years
of
his
life
:
 
far
more
happily
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
than
he
had
lived
for
a
long
while
in
angry
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
there
was
,
in
the
West
of
Scotland
,
a
gentleman
of
small
fortune
,
named
WILLIAM
WALLACE
,
the
second
son
of
a
Scottish
knight
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
of
great
size
and
great
strength
;
he
was
very
brave
and
daring
;
when
he
spoke
to
a
body
of
his
countrymen
,
he
could
rouse
them
in
a
wonderful
manner
by
the
power
of
his
burning
words
;
he
loved
Scotland
dearly
,
and
he
hated
England
with
his
utmost
might
.
 
<EOS>
The
domineering
conduct
of
the
English
who
now
held
the
places
of
trust
in
Scotland
made
them
as
intolerable
to
the
proud
Scottish
people
as
they
had
been
,
under
similar
circumstances
,
to
the
Welsh
;
and
no
man
in
all
Scotland
regarded
them
with
so
much
smothered
rage
as
William
Wallace
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
an
Englishman
in
office
,
little
knowing
what
he
was
,
affronted
HIM
.
<EOS>
Wallace
instantly
struck
him
dead
,
and
taking
refuge
among
the
rocks
and
hills
,
and
there
joining
with
his
countryman
,
SIR
WILLIAM
DOUGLAS
,
who
was
also
in
arms
against
King
Edward
,
became
the
most
resolute
and
undaunted
champion
of
a
people
struggling
for
their
independence
that
ever
lived
upon
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
Guardian
of
the
Kingdom
fled
before
him
,
and
,
thus
encouraged
,
the
Scottish
people
revolted
everywhere
,
and
fell
upon
the
English
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Surrey
,
by
the
King
's
commands
,
raised
all
the
power
of
the
Border
-
counties
,
and
two
English
armies
poured
into
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
Only
one
Chief
,
in
the
face
of
those
armies
,
stood
by
Wallace
,
who
,
with
a
force
of
forty
thousand
men
,
awaited
the
invaders
at
a
place
on
the
river
<EOS>
Forth
,
within
two
miles
of
Stirling
.
 
<EOS>
Across
the
river
there
was
only
one
poor
wooden
bridge
,
called
the
bridge
of
Kildean
---
so
narrow
,
that
<EOS>
but
two
men
could
cross
it
abreast
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
eyes
upon
this
bridge
,
Wallace
posted
the
greater
part
of
his
men
among
some
rising
grounds
,
and
waited
calmly
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
English
army
came
up
on
the
opposite
bank
of
the
river
,
messengers
were
sent
forward
to
offer
terms
.
 
<EOS>
Wallace
sent
them
back
with
a
defiance
,
in
the
name
of
the
freedom
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
officers
of
the
Earl
of
Surrey
in
command
of
the
English
,
with
THEIR
eyes
also
on
the
bridge
,
advised
him
to
be
discreet
and
not
hasty
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
however
,
urged
to
immediate
battle
by
some
other
officers
,
and
particularly
by
CRESSINGHAM
,
King
Edward
's
treasurer
,
and
a
rash
man
,
gave
the
word
of
command
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
One
thousand
English
crossed
the
bridge
,
two
abreast
;
the
Scottish
troops
were
as
motionless
as
stone
images
.
 
<EOS>
Two
thousand
English
crossed
;
three
thousand
,
four
thousand
,
five
.
 
<EOS>
Not
a
feather
,
all
this
time
,
had
been
seen
to
stir
among
the
Scottish
bonnets
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
they
all
fluttered
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Forward
,
one
party
,
to
the
foot
of
the
Bridge
!
"
cried
Wallace
,
"
and
let
no
more
English
cross
!
 
<EOS>
The
rest
,
down
with
me
on
the
five
thousand
who
have
come
over
,
and
cut
them
all
to
pieces
!
"
 
<EOS>
It
was
done
,
in
the
sight
of
the
whole
remainder
of
the
English
army
,
who
could
give
no
help
.
 
<EOS>
Cressingham
himself
was
killed
,
and
the
Scotch
made
whips
for
their
horses
of
his
skin
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
was
abroad
at
this
time
,
and
during
the
successes
on
the
Scottish
side
which
followed
,
and
which
enabled
bold
Wallace
to
win
the
whole
country
back
again
,
and
even
to
ravage
the
English
borders
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
after
a
few
winter
months
,
the
King
returned
,
and
took
the
field
with
more
than
his
usual
energy
.
 
<EOS>
One
night
,
when
a
kick
from
his
horse
as
they
both
lay
on
the
ground
together
broke
two
of
his
ribs
,
and
a
cry
arose
that
he
was
killed
,
he
leaped
into
his
saddle
,
regardless
of
the
pain
he
suffered
,
and
rode
through
the
camp
.
 
<EOS>
Day
then
appearing
,
he
gave
the
word
(
still
,
of
course
,
in
that
bruised
and
aching
state
)
Forward
!
<EOS>
and
led
his
army
on
to
near
Falkirk
,
where
the
Scottish
forces
were
seen
drawn
up
on
some
stony
ground
,
behind
a
morass
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
he
defeated
Wallace
,
and
killed
fifteen
thousand
of
his
men
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
shattered
remainder
,
Wallace
drew
back
to
Stirling
;
but
,
being
pursued
,
set
fire
to
the
town
that
it
might
give
no
help
to
the
English
,
and
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
The
inhabitants
of
Perth
afterwards
set
fire
to
their
houses
for
the
same
reason
,
and
the
King
,
unable
to
find
provisions
,
was
forced
to
withdraw
his
army
.
  
<EOS>
Another
ROBERT
BRUCE
,
the
grandson
of
him
who
had
disputed
the
Scottish
crown
with
Baliol
,
was
now
in
arms
against
the
King
(
that
elder
Bruce
being
dead
)
,
and
also
JOHN
COMYN
,
Baliol
's
nephew
.
<EOS>
These
two
young
men
might
agree
in
opposing
Edward
,
but
could
agree
in
nothing
else
,
as
they
were
rivals
for
the
throne
of
Scotland
.
<EOS>
Probably
it
was
because
they
knew
this
,
and
knew
what
troubles
must
arise
even
if
they
could
hope
to
get
the
better
of
the
great
English
King
,
that
the
principal
Scottish
people
applied
to
the
Pope
for
his
interference
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
,
on
the
principle
of
losing
nothing
for
want
of
trying
to
get
it
,
very
coolly
claimed
that
Scotland
belonged
to
him
;
but
this
was
a
little
too
much
,
and
the
Parliament
in
a
friendly
manner
told
him
so
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
spring
time
of
the
year
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
three
,
the
King
sent
SIR
JOHN
SEGRAVE
,
whom
he
made
Governor
of
Scotland
,
with
twenty
thousand
men
,
to
reduce
the
rebels
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
was
not
as
careful
as
he
should
have
been
,
but
encamped
at
Rosslyn
,
near
Edinburgh
,
with
his
army
divided
into
three
parts
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
forces
saw
their
advantage
;
fell
on
each
part
separately
;
defeated
each
;
and
killed
all
the
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
came
the
King
himself
once
more
,
as
soon
as
a
great
army
could
be
raised
;
he
passed
through
the
whole
north
of
Scotland
,
laying
waste
whatsoever
came
in
his
way
;
and
he
took
up
his
winter
quarters
at
Dunfermline
.
<EOS>
The
Scottish
cause
now
looked
so
hopeless
,
that
Comyn
and
the
other
nobles
made
submission
and
received
their
pardons
.
 
<EOS>
Wallace
alone
stood
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
invited
to
surrender
,
though
on
no
distinct
pledge
that
his
life
should
be
spared
;
but
he
still
defied
the
ireful
King
,
and
lived
among
the
steep
crags
of
the
Highland
glens
,
where
the
eagles
made
their
nests
,
and
where
the
mountain
torrents
roared
,
and
the
white
snow
was
deep
,
and
the
bitter
winds
blew
round
his
unsheltered
head
,
as
he
lay
through
many
a
pitch
-
dark
night
wrapped
up
in
his
plaid
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
break
his
spirit
;
nothing
could
lower
his
courage
;
nothing
could
induce
him
to
forget
or
to
forgive
his
country
's
wrongs
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
the
Castle
of
Stirling
,
which
had
long
held
out
,
was
besieged
by
the
King
with
every
kind
of
military
engine
then
in
use
;
even
when
the
lead
upon
cathedral
roofs
was
taken
down
to
help
to
make
them
;
even
when
the
King
,
though
an
old
man
,
commanded
in
the
siege
as
if
he
were
a
youth
,
being
so
resolved
to
conquer
;
even
when
the
brave
garrison
(
then
found
with
amazement
to
be
not
two
hundred
people
,
including
several
ladies
)
were
starved
and
beaten
out
and
were
made
to
submit
on
their
knees
,
and
with
every
form
of
disgrace
that
could
aggravate
their
sufferings
;
even
then
,
when
there
was
not
a
ray
of
hope
in
Scotland
,
William
Wallace
was
as
proud
and
firm
as
if
he
had
beheld
the
powerful
and
relentless
Edward
lying
dead
at
his
feet
.
  
<EOS>
Who
betrayed
William
Wallace
in
the
end
,
is
not
quite
certain
.
<EOS>
That
he
was
betrayed
---
probably
by
an
attendant
---
is
too
true
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
to
the
Castle
of
Dumbarton
,
under
SIR
JOHN
MENTEITH
,
and
thence
to
London
,
where
the
great
fame
of
his
bravery
and
resolution
attracted
immense
concourses
of
people
to
behold
him
.
<EOS>
He
was
tried
in
Westminster
Hall
,
with
a
crown
of
laurel
on
his
head
---
it
is
supposed
because
he
was
reported
to
have
said
that
he
ought
to
wear
,
or
that
he
would
wear
,
a
crown
there
and
was
found
guilty
as
a
robber
,
a
murderer
,
and
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
called
a
robber
(
he
said
to
those
who
tried
him
)
<EOS>
he
was
,
because
he
had
taken
spoil
from
the
King
's
men
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
called
a
murderer
,
he
was
,
because
he
had
slain
an
insolent
Englishman
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
called
a
traitor
,
he
was
not
,
for
he
had
never
sworn
allegiance
to
the
King
,
and
had
ever
scorned
to
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dragged
at
the
tails
of
horses
to
West
Smithfield
,
and
there
hanged
on
a
high
gallows
,
torn
open
before
he
was
dead
,
beheaded
,
and
quartered
.
 
<EOS>
His
head
was
set
upon
a
pole
on
London
Bridge
,
his
right
arm
was
sent
to
Newcastle
,
his
left
arm
to
Berwick
,
his
legs
to
Perth
and
Aberdeen
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
King
Edward
had
had
his
body
cut
into
inches
,
and
had
sent
every
separate
inch
into
a
separate
town
,
he
could
not
have
dispersed
it
half
so
far
and
wide
as
his
fame
.
 
<EOS>
Wallace
will
be
remembered
in
songs
and
stories
,
while
there
are
songs
and
stories
in
the
English
tongue
,
and
Scotland
will
hold
him
dear
while
her
lakes
and
mountains
last
.
  
<EOS>
Released
from
this
dreaded
enemy
,
the
King
made
a
fairer
plan
of
Government
for
Scotland
,
divided
the
offices
of
honour
among
Scottish
gentlemen
and
English
gentlemen
,
forgave
past
offences
,
and
thought
,
in
his
old
age
,
that
his
work
was
done
.
  
<EOS>
But
he
deceived
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Comyn
and
Bruce
conspired
,
and
made
an
appointment
to
meet
at
Dumfries
,
in
the
church
of
the
Minorites
.
<EOS>
There
is
a
story
that
Comyn
was
false
to
Bruce
,
and
had
informed
against
him
to
the
King
;
that
Bruce
was
warned
of
his
danger
and
the
necessity
of
flight
,
by
receiving
,
one
night
as
he
sat
at
supper
,
from
his
friend
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
twelve
pennies
and
a
pair
of
spurs
;
that
as
he
was
riding
angrily
to
keep
his
appointment
(
through
a
snow
-
storm
,
with
his
horse
's
shoes
reversed
that
he
might
not
be
tracked
)
,
he
met
an
evil
-
looking
serving
man
,
a
messenger
of
Comyn
,
whom
he
killed
,
and
concealed
in
whose
dress
he
found
letters
that
proved
Comyn
's
treachery
.
 
<EOS>
However
this
may
be
,
they
were
likely
enough
to
quarrel
in
any
case
,
being
hot
-
headed
rivals
;
and
,
whatever
they
quarrelled
about
,
they
certainly
did
quarrel
in
the
church
where
they
met
,
and
Bruce
drew
his
dagger
and
stabbed
Comyn
,
who
fell
upon
the
pavement
.
 
<EOS>
When
Bruce
came
out
,
pale
and
disturbed
,
the
friends
who
were
waiting
for
him
asked
what
was
the
matter
?
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
I
have
killed
Comyn
,
"
said
he
.
 
<EOS>
"
You
only
think
so
?
"
<EOS>
returned
one
of
them
;
"
I
will
make
sure
!
"
and
going
into
the
church
,
and
finding
him
alive
,
stabbed
him
again
and
again
.
 
<EOS>
Knowing
that
the
King
would
never
forgive
this
new
deed
of
violence
,
the
party
then
declared
Bruce
King
of
Scotland
:
 
got
him
crowned
at
Scone
---
without
the
chair
;
and
set
up
the
rebellious
standard
once
again
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
King
heard
of
it
he
kindled
with
fiercer
anger
than
he
had
ever
shown
yet
.
 
<EOS>
He
caused
the
Prince
of
Wales
and
two
hundred
and
seventy
of
the
young
nobility
to
be
knighted
---
the
trees
in
the
Temple
Gardens
were
cut
down
to
make
room
for
their
tents
,
and
they
watched
their
armour
all
night
,
according
to
the
old
usage
:
 
some
in
the
Temple
Church
:
 
some
in
Westminster
Abbey
---
and
at
the
public
Feast
which
then
took
place
,
he
swore
,
by
Heaven
,
and
by
two
swans
covered
with
gold
network
which
his
minstrels
placed
upon
the
table
,
that
he
would
avenge
the
death
of
Comyn
,
and
would
punish
the
false
Bruce
.
 
<EOS>
And
before
all
the
company
,
he
charged
the
Prince
his
son
,
in
case
that
he
should
die
before
accomplishing
his
vow
,
not
to
bury
him
until
it
was
fulfilled
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
Prince
and
the
rest
of
the
young
Knights
rode
away
to
the
Border
-
country
to
join
the
English
army
;
and
the
King
,
now
weak
and
sick
,
followed
in
a
horse
-
litter
.
  
<EOS>
Bruce
,
after
losing
a
battle
and
undergoing
many
dangers
and
much
misery
,
fled
to
Ireland
,
where
he
lay
concealed
through
the
winter
.
<EOS>
That
winter
,
Edward
passed
in
hunting
down
and
executing
Bruce
's
relations
and
adherents
,
sparing
neither
youth
nor
age
,
and
showing
no
touch
of
pity
or
sign
of
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
following
spring
,
Bruce
reappeared
and
gained
some
victories
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
frays
,
both
sides
were
grievously
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
For
instance
---
Bruce
's
two
brothers
,
being
taken
captives
desperately
wounded
,
were
ordered
by
the
King
to
instant
execution
.
 
<EOS>
Bruce
's
friend
Sir
John
Douglas
,
taking
his
own
Castle
of
Douglas
out
of
the
hands
of
an
English
Lord
,
roasted
the
dead
bodies
of
the
slaughtered
garrison
in
a
great
fire
made
of
every
movable
within
it
;
which
dreadful
cookery
his
men
called
the
Douglas
Larder
.
 
<EOS>
Bruce
,
still
successful
,
however
,
drove
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
and
the
Earl
of
Gloucester
into
the
Castle
of
Ayr
and
laid
siege
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
had
been
laid
up
all
the
winter
,
but
had
directed
the
army
from
his
sick
-
bed
,
now
advanced
to
Carlisle
,
and
there
,
causing
the
litter
in
which
he
had
travelled
to
be
placed
in
the
Cathedral
as
an
offering
to
Heaven
,
mounted
his
horse
once
more
,
and
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
sixty
-
nine
years
old
,
and
had
reigned
thirty
-
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
ill
,
that
in
four
days
he
could
go
no
more
than
six
miles
;
still
,
even
at
that
pace
,
he
went
on
and
resolutely
kept
his
face
towards
the
Border
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
he
lay
down
at
the
village
of
Burgh
-
upon
-
Sands
;
and
there
,
telling
those
around
him
to
impress
upon
the
Prince
that
he
was
to
remember
his
father
's
vow
,
and
was
never
to
rest
until
he
had
thoroughly
subdued
Scotland
,
he
yielded
up
his
last
breath
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
Second
    
KING
Edward
the
Second
,
the
first
Prince
of
Wales
,
was
twenty
-
three
years
old
when
his
father
died
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
favourite
of
his
,
a
young
man
from
Gascony
,
named
PIERS
GAVESTON
,
of
whom
his
father
had
so
much
disapproved
that
he
had
ordered
him
out
of
England
,
and
had
made
his
son
swear
by
the
side
of
his
sick
-
bed
,
never
to
bring
him
back
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Prince
no
sooner
found
himself
King
,
than
he
broke
his
oath
,
as
so
many
other
Princes
and
Kings
did
<EOS>
(
they
were
far
too
ready
to
take
oaths
)
,
and
sent
for
his
dear
friend
immediately
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
this
same
Gaveston
was
handsome
enough
,
but
was
a
reckless
,
insolent
,
audacious
fellow
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
detested
by
the
proud
English
Lords
:
 
not
only
because
he
had
such
power
over
the
King
,
and
made
the
Court
such
a
dissipated
place
,
but
,
also
,
because
he
could
ride
better
than
they
at
tournaments
,
and
was
used
,
in
his
impudence
,
to
cut
very
bad
jokes
on
them
;
calling
one
,
the
old
hog
;
another
,
the
stage
-
player
;
another
,
the
Jew
;
another
,
the
black
dog
of
Ardenne
.
<EOS>
This
was
as
poor
wit
as
need
be
,
but
it
made
those
Lords
very
wroth
;
and
the
surly
Earl
of
Warwick
,
who
was
the
black
dog
,
swore
that
the
time
should
come
when
Piers
Gaveston
should
feel
the
black
dog
's
teeth
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
come
yet
,
however
,
nor
did
it
seem
to
be
coming
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
made
him
Earl
of
Cornwall
,
and
gave
him
vast
riches
;
and
,
when
the
King
went
over
to
France
to
marry
the
French
Princess
,
ISABELLA
,
daughter
of
PHILIP
LE
BEL
:
 
who
was
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
woman
in
the
world
:
 
he
made
Gaveston
,
Regent
of
the
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
His
splendid
marriage
-
ceremony
in
the
Church
of
Our
Lady
at
Boulogne
,
where
there
were
four
Kings
and
three
Queens
present
(
quite
a
pack
of
Court
Cards
,
<EOS>
for
I
dare
say
the
Knaves
were
not
wanting
)
,
being
over
,
he
seemed
to
care
little
or
nothing
for
his
beautiful
wife
;
but
was
wild
with
impatience
to
meet
Gaveston
again
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
landed
at
home
,
he
paid
no
attention
to
anybody
else
,
but
ran
into
the
favourite
's
arms
before
a
great
concourse
of
people
,
and
hugged
him
,
and
kissed
him
,
and
called
him
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
coronation
which
soon
followed
,
Gaveston
was
the
richest
and
brightest
of
all
the
glittering
company
there
,
and
had
the
honour
of
carrying
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
the
proud
Lords
fiercer
than
ever
;
the
people
,
too
,
despised
the
favourite
,
and
would
never
call
him
Earl
of
Cornwall
,
however
much
he
complained
to
the
King
and
asked
him
to
punish
them
for
not
doing
so
,
but
persisted
in
styling
him
plain
Piers
Gaveston
.
  
<EOS>
The
Barons
were
so
unceremonious
with
the
King
in
giving
him
to
understand
that
they
would
not
bear
this
favourite
,
that
the
King
was
obliged
to
send
him
out
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
The
favourite
himself
was
made
to
take
an
oath
(
more
oaths
!
)
<EOS>
that
he
would
never
come
back
,
and
the
Barons
supposed
him
to
be
banished
in
disgrace
,
until
they
heard
that
he
was
appointed
Governor
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
Even
this
was
not
enough
for
the
besotted
King
,
who
brought
him
home
again
in
a
year
's
time
,
and
not
only
disgusted
the
Court
and
the
people
by
his
doting
folly
,
but
offended
his
beautiful
wife
too
,
who
never
liked
him
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
now
the
old
Royal
want
---
of
money
---
and
the
Barons
had
the
new
power
of
positively
refusing
to
let
him
raise
any
.
 
<EOS>
He
summoned
a
Parliament
at
York
;
the
Barons
refused
to
make
one
,
while
the
favourite
was
near
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
summoned
another
Parliament
at
Westminster
,
and
sent
Gaveston
away
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Barons
came
,
completely
armed
,
and
appointed
a
committee
of
themselves
to
correct
abuses
in
the
state
and
in
the
King
's
household
.
 
<EOS>
He
got
some
money
on
these
conditions
,
and
directly
set
off
with
Gaveston
to
the
Border
-
country
,
where
they
spent
it
in
idling
away
the
time
,
and
feasting
,
while
Bruce
made
ready
to
drive
the
English
out
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
though
the
old
King
had
even
made
this
poor
weak
son
of
his
swear
(
as
some
say
)
that
he
would
not
bury
his
bones
,
but
would
have
them
boiled
clean
in
a
caldron
,
and
carried
before
the
English
army
until
Scotland
was
entirely
subdued
,
the
second
Edward
was
so
unlike
the
first
that
Bruce
gained
strength
and
power
every
day
.
  
<EOS>
The
committee
of
Nobles
,
after
some
months
of
deliberation
,
ordained
that
the
King
should
henceforth
call
a
Parliament
together
,
once
every
year
,
and
even
twice
if
necessary
,
instead
of
summoning
it
only
when
he
chose
.
 
<EOS>
Further
,
that
Gaveston
should
once
more
be
banished
,
and
,
this
time
,
on
pain
of
death
if
he
ever
came
back
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
tears
were
of
no
avail
;
he
was
obliged
to
send
his
favourite
to
Flanders
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
had
done
so
,
however
,
he
dissolved
the
Parliament
,
with
the
low
cunning
of
a
mere
fool
,
and
set
off
to
the
North
of
England
,
thinking
to
get
an
army
about
him
to
oppose
the
Nobles
.
 
<EOS>
And
once
again
he
brought
Gaveston
home
,
and
heaped
upon
him
all
the
riches
and
titles
of
which
the
Barons
had
deprived
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
Lords
saw
,
now
,
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
put
the
favourite
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
They
could
have
done
so
,
legally
,
according
to
the
terms
of
his
banishment
;
but
they
did
so
<EOS>
,
I
am
sorry
to
say
,
in
a
shabby
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Led
by
the
Earl
of
Lancaster
,
the
King
's
cousin
,
they
first
of
all
attacked
the
King
and
Gaveston
at
Newcastle
.
<EOS>
They
had
time
to
escape
by
sea
,
and
the
mean
King
,
having
his
precious
Gaveston
with
him
,
was
quite
content
to
leave
his
lovely
wife
behind
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
were
comparatively
safe
,
they
separated
;
the
King
went
to
York
to
collect
a
force
of
soldiers
;
and
the
favourite
shut
himself
up
,
in
the
meantime
,
in
Scarborough
Castle
overlooking
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
what
the
Barons
wanted
.
 
<EOS>
They
knew
that
the
Castle
could
not
hold
out
;
they
attacked
it
,
and
made
Gaveston
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
He
delivered
himself
up
to
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
---
that
Lord
whom
he
had
called
the
Jew
---
on
the
Earl
's
pledging
his
faith
and
knightly
word
,
that
no
harm
should
happen
to
him
and
no
violence
be
done
him
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
was
agreed
with
Gaveston
that
he
should
be
taken
to
the
Castle
of
Wallingford
,
and
there
kept
in
honourable
custody
.
 
<EOS>
They
travelled
as
far
as
Dedington
,
near
Banbury
,
<EOS>
where
,
in
the
Castle
of
that
place
,
they
stopped
for
a
night
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
left
his
prisoner
there
,
knowing
what
would
happen
,
or
really
left
him
thinking
no
harm
,
and
only
going
(
as
he
pretended
)
to
visit
his
wife
,
the
Countess
,
who
was
in
the
neighbourhood
,
is
no
great
matter
now
;
in
any
case
,
he
was
bound
as
an
honourable
gentleman
to
protect
his
prisoner
,
and
he
did
not
do
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
while
the
favourite
was
yet
in
bed
,
he
was
required
to
dress
himself
and
come
down
into
the
court
-
yard
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
without
any
mistrust
,
but
started
and
turned
pale
when
he
found
it
full
of
strange
armed
men
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
think
you
know
me
?
"
said
their
leader
,
also
armed
from
head
to
foot
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
am
the
black
dog
of
Ardenne
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
time
was
come
when
Piers
Gaveston
was
to
feel
the
black
dog
's
teeth
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
They
set
him
on
a
mule
,
and
carried
him
,
in
mock
state
and
with
military
music
,
to
the
black
dog
's
kennel
---
Warwick
Castle
---
where
a
hasty
council
,
composed
of
some
great
noblemen
,
considered
what
should
be
done
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
for
sparing
him
,
but
one
loud
voice
---
it
was
the
black
dog
's
bark
,
I
dare
say
---
sounded
through
the
Castle
Hall
,
uttering
these
words
:
 
<EOS>
"
You
have
the
fox
in
your
power
.
 
<EOS>
Let
him
go
now
,
and
you
must
hunt
him
again
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
They
sentenced
him
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
the
Earl
of
Lancaster
---
the
old
hog
---
<EOS>
but
the
old
hog
was
as
savage
as
the
dog
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
out
upon
the
pleasant
road
,
leading
from
Warwick
to
Coventry
,
where
the
beautiful
river
Avon
,
by
which
,
long
afterwards
,
WILLIAM
SHAKESPEARE
was
born
and
now
lies
buried
,
sparkled
in
the
bright
landscape
of
the
beautiful
May
-
day
;
and
there
they
struck
off
his
wretched
head
,
and
stained
the
dust
with
his
blood
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
King
heard
of
this
black
deed
,
in
his
grief
and
rage
he
denounced
relentless
war
against
his
Barons
,
and
both
sides
were
in
arms
for
half
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
then
became
necessary
for
them
to
join
their
forces
against
Bruce
,
who
had
used
the
time
well
while
they
were
divided
,
and
had
now
a
great
power
in
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
Intelligence
was
brought
that
Bruce
was
then
besieging
Stirling
Castle
,
and
that
the
Governor
had
been
obliged
to
pledge
himself
to
surrender
it
,
unless
he
should
be
relieved
before
a
certain
day
.
<EOS>
Hereupon
,
the
King
ordered
the
nobles
and
their
fighting
-
men
to
meet
him
at
Berwick
;
but
,
the
nobles
cared
so
little
for
the
King
,
and
so
neglected
the
summons
,
and
lost
time
,
that
only
on
the
day
before
that
appointed
for
the
surrender
,
did
the
King
find
himself
at
Stirling
,
and
even
then
with
a
smaller
force
than
he
had
expected
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
had
,
altogether
,
<EOS>
a
hundred
thousand
men
,
and
Bruce
had
not
more
than
forty
thousand
;
but
,
Bruce
's
army
was
strongly
posted
in
three
square
columns
,
on
the
ground
lying
between
the
Burn
or
Brook
of
Bannock
and
the
walls
of
Stirling
Castle
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
very
evening
,
when
the
King
came
up
,
Bruce
did
a
brave
act
that
encouraged
his
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
seen
by
a
certain
HENRY
DE
BOHUN
,
an
English
Knight
,
riding
about
before
his
army
on
a
little
horse
,
with
a
light
battle
-
axe
in
his
hand
,
and
a
crown
of
gold
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
This
English
Knight
,
who
was
mounted
on
a
strong
war
-
horse
,
cased
in
steel
,
strongly
armed
,
and
able
(
as
he
thought
)
to
overthrow
Bruce
by
crushing
him
with
his
mere
weight
,
set
spurs
to
his
great
charger
,
rode
on
him
,
and
made
a
thrust
at
him
with
his
heavy
spear
.
 
<EOS>
Bruce
parried
the
thrust
,
and
with
one
blow
of
his
battle
-
axe
split
his
skull
.
  
<EOS>
The
Scottish
men
did
not
forget
this
,
next
day
when
the
battle
raged
.
 
<EOS>
RANDOLPH
,
Bruce
's
valiant
Nephew
,
rode
,
with
the
small
body
of
men
he
commanded
,
into
such
a
host
of
the
English
,
all
shining
in
polished
armour
in
the
sunlight
,
that
they
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
and
lost
,
as
if
they
had
plunged
into
the
sea
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
they
fought
so
well
,
and
did
such
dreadful
execution
,
that
the
English
staggered
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
Bruce
himself
upon
them
,
with
all
the
rest
of
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
hard
pressed
and
amazed
,
there
appeared
upon
the
hills
what
they
supposed
to
be
a
new
Scottish
army
,
but
what
were
really
only
the
camp
followers
,
in
number
fifteen
thousand
:
 
whom
Bruce
had
taught
to
show
themselves
at
that
place
and
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
commanding
the
English
horse
,
made
a
last
rush
to
change
the
fortune
of
the
day
;
but
Bruce
(
like
Jack
the
Giant
-
killer
in
the
story
)
had
had
pits
dug
in
the
ground
,
and
covered
over
with
turfs
and
stakes
.
 
<EOS>
Into
these
,
as
they
gave
way
beneath
the
weight
of
the
horses
,
riders
and
horses
rolled
by
hundreds
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
were
completely
routed
;
all
their
treasure
,
stores
,
and
engines
,
were
taken
by
the
Scottish
men
;
so
many
waggons
and
other
wheeled
vehicles
were
seized
,
that
it
is
related
that
they
would
have
reached
,
if
they
had
been
drawn
out
in
a
line
,
one
hundred
and
eighty
miles
.
 
<EOS>
The
fortunes
of
Scotland
were
,
for
the
time
,
completely
changed
;
and
never
was
a
battle
won
,
more
famous
upon
Scottish
ground
,
than
this
great
battle
of
BANNOCKBURN
.
  
<EOS>
Plague
and
famine
succeeded
in
England
;
and
still
the
powerless
King
and
his
disdainful
Lords
were
always
in
contention
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
turbulent
chiefs
of
Ireland
made
proposals
to
Bruce
,
to
accept
the
rule
of
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
his
brother
Edward
to
them
,
who
was
crowned
King
of
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
He
afterwards
went
himself
to
help
his
brother
in
his
Irish
wars
,
but
his
brother
was
defeated
in
the
end
and
killed
.
 
<EOS>
Robert
Bruce
,
returning
to
Scotland
,
still
increased
his
strength
there
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
King
's
ruin
had
begun
in
a
favourite
,
so
it
seemed
likely
to
end
in
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
too
poor
a
creature
to
rely
at
all
upon
himself
;
and
his
new
favourite
was
one
HUGH
LE
DESPENSER
,
the
son
of
a
gentleman
of
ancient
family
.
 
<EOS>
Hugh
was
handsome
and
brave
,
but
he
was
the
favourite
of
a
weak
King
,
whom
no
man
cared
a
rush
for
,
and
that
was
a
dangerous
place
to
hold
.
 
<EOS>
The
Nobles
leagued
against
him
,
because
the
King
liked
him
;
and
they
lay
in
wait
,
both
for
his
ruin
and
his
father
's
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
King
had
married
him
to
the
daughter
of
the
late
Earl
of
Gloucester
,
and
had
given
both
him
and
his
father
great
possessions
in
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
In
their
endeavours
to
extend
these
,
they
gave
violent
offence
to
an
angry
Welsh
gentleman
,
named
JOHN
DE
MOWBRAY
,
and
to
divers
other
angry
Welsh
gentlemen
,
who
resorted
to
arms
,
took
their
castles
,
and
seized
their
estates
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Lancaster
had
first
placed
the
favourite
(
who
was
a
poor
relation
of
his
own
)
at
Court
,
and
he
considered
his
own
dignity
offended
by
the
preference
he
received
and
the
honours
he
acquired
;
so
he
,
and
the
Barons
who
were
his
friends
,
joined
the
Welshmen
,
marched
on
London
,
and
sent
a
message
to
the
King
demanding
to
have
the
favourite
and
his
father
banished
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
King
unaccountably
took
it
into
his
head
to
be
spirited
,
and
to
send
them
a
bold
reply
;
but
when
they
quartered
themselves
around
Holborn
and
Clerkenwell
,
and
went
down
,
armed
,
to
the
Parliament
at
Westminster
,
he
gave
way
,
and
complied
with
their
demands
.
  
<EOS>
His
turn
of
triumph
came
sooner
than
he
expected
.
 
<EOS>
It
arose
out
of
an
accidental
circumstance
.
 
<EOS>
The
beautiful
Queen
happening
to
be
travelling
,
came
one
night
to
one
of
the
royal
castles
,
and
demanded
to
be
lodged
and
entertained
there
until
morning
.
 
<EOS>
The
governor
of
this
castle
,
who
was
one
of
the
enraged
lords
,
was
away
,
and
in
his
absence
,
his
wife
refused
admission
to
the
Queen
;
a
scuffle
took
place
among
the
common
men
on
either
side
,
and
some
of
the
royal
attendants
were
killed
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
,
who
cared
nothing
for
the
King
,
were
very
angry
that
their
beautiful
Queen
should
be
thus
rudely
treated
in
her
own
dominions
;
and
the
King
,
taking
advantage
of
this
feeling
,
besieged
the
castle
,
took
it
,
and
then
called
the
two
Despensers
home
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
confederate
lords
and
the
Welshmen
went
over
to
Bruce
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
encountered
them
at
Boroughbridge
,
gained
the
victory
,
and
took
a
number
of
distinguished
prisoners
;
among
them
,
the
Earl
of
Lancaster
,
now
an
old
man
,
upon
whose
destruction
he
was
resolved
.
 
<EOS>
This
Earl
was
taken
to
his
own
castle
of
Pontefract
,
and
there
tried
and
found
guilty
by
an
unfair
court
appointed
for
the
purpose
;
he
was
not
even
allowed
to
speak
in
his
own
defence
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
insulted
,
pelted
,
mounted
on
a
starved
pony
without
saddle
or
bridle
,
carried
out
,
and
beheaded
.
 
<EOS>
Eight
-
and
-
twenty
knights
were
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
had
despatched
this
bloody
work
,
and
had
made
a
fresh
and
a
long
truce
with
Bruce
,
he
took
the
Despensers
into
greater
favour
than
ever
,
and
made
the
father
Earl
of
Winchester
.
  
<EOS>
One
prisoner
,
and
an
important
one
,
who
was
taken
at
Boroughbridge
,
made
his
escape
,
however
,
and
turned
the
tide
against
the
King
.
<EOS>
This
was
ROGER
MORTIMER
,
always
resolutely
opposed
to
him
,
who
was
sentenced
to
death
,
and
placed
for
safe
custody
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
treated
his
guards
to
a
quantity
of
wine
into
which
he
had
put
a
sleeping
potion
;
and
,
when
they
were
insensible
,
broke
out
of
his
dungeon
,
got
into
a
kitchen
,
climbed
up
the
chimney
,
let
himself
down
from
the
roof
of
the
building
with
a
rope
-
ladder
,
passed
the
sentries
,
got
down
to
the
river
,
and
made
away
in
a
boat
to
where
servants
and
horses
were
waiting
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
finally
escaped
to
France
,
where
CHARLES
LE
BEL
,
the
brother
of
the
beautiful
Queen
,
was
King
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
sought
to
quarrel
with
the
King
of
England
,
on
pretence
of
his
not
having
come
to
do
him
homage
at
his
coronation
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
proposed
that
the
beautiful
Queen
should
go
over
to
arrange
the
dispute
;
she
went
,
and
wrote
home
to
the
King
,
that
as
he
was
sick
and
could
not
come
to
France
himself
,
perhaps
it
would
be
better
to
send
over
the
young
Prince
,
their
son
,
who
was
only
twelve
years
old
,
who
could
do
homage
to
her
brother
in
his
stead
,
and
in
whose
company
she
would
immediately
return
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
sent
him
:
 
but
,
both
he
and
the
Queen
remained
at
the
French
Court
,
and
Roger
Mortimer
became
the
Queen
's
lover
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
King
wrote
,
again
and
again
,
to
the
Queen
to
come
home
,
she
did
not
reply
that
she
despised
him
too
much
to
live
with
him
any
more
(
which
was
the
truth
)
,
but
said
she
was
afraid
of
the
two
Despensers
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
her
design
was
to
overthrow
the
favourites
"
power
,
and
the
King
's
power
,
such
as
it
was
,
and
invade
England
.
<EOS>
Having
obtained
a
French
force
of
two
thousand
men
,
and
being
joined
by
all
the
English
exiles
then
in
France
,
she
landed
,
within
a
year
,
at
Orewell
,
in
Suffolk
,
where
she
was
immediately
joined
by
the
Earls
of
Kent
and
Norfolk
,
the
King
's
two
brothers
;
by
other
powerful
noblemen
;
and
lastly
,
by
the
first
English
general
who
was
despatched
to
check
her
:
 
who
went
over
to
her
with
all
his
men
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
London
,
receiving
these
tidings
,
would
do
nothing
for
the
King
,
but
broke
open
the
Tower
,
let
out
all
his
prisoners
,
and
threw
up
their
caps
and
hurrahed
for
the
beautiful
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
with
his
two
favourites
,
fled
to
Bristol
,
where
he
left
old
Despenser
in
charge
of
the
town
and
castle
,
while
he
went
on
with
the
son
to
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bristol
men
being
opposed
to
the
King
,
and
it
being
impossible
to
hold
the
town
with
enemies
everywhere
within
the
walls
,
Despenser
yielded
it
up
on
the
third
day
,
and
was
instantly
brought
to
trial
for
having
traitorously
influenced
what
was
called
"
the
King
's
mind
"
---
though
I
doubt
if
the
King
ever
had
any
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
venerable
old
man
,
upwards
of
ninety
years
of
age
,
but
his
age
gained
no
respect
or
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
hanged
,
torn
open
while
he
was
yet
alive
,
cut
up
into
pieces
,
and
thrown
to
the
dogs
.
<EOS>
His
son
was
soon
taken
,
tried
at
Hereford
before
the
same
judge
on
a
long
series
of
foolish
charges
,
found
guilty
,
and
hanged
upon
a
gallows
fifty
feet
high
,
with
a
chaplet
of
nettles
round
his
head
.
<EOS>
His
poor
old
father
and
<EOS>
he
were
innocent
enough
of
any
worse
crimes
than
the
crime
of
having
been
friends
of
a
King
,
on
whom
,
as
a
mere
man
,
they
would
never
have
deigned
to
cast
a
favourable
look
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
bad
crime
,
I
know
,
and
leads
to
worse
;
but
,
many
lords
and
gentlemen
---
I
even
think
some
ladies
,
too
,
if
I
recollect
right
---
have
committed
it
in
England
,
who
have
neither
been
given
to
the
dogs
,
nor
hanged
up
fifty
feet
high
.
  
<EOS>
The
wretched
King
was
running
here
and
there
,
all
this
time
,
and
never
getting
anywhere
in
particular
,
until
he
gave
himself
up
,
and
was
taken
off
to
Kenilworth
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
safely
lodged
there
,
the
Queen
went
to
London
and
met
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
Bishop
of
Hereford
,
who
was
the
most
skilful
of
her
friends
,
said
,
What
was
to
be
done
now
?
 
<EOS>
Here
was
an
imbecile
,
indolent
,
miserable
King
upon
the
throne
;
would
n't
it
be
better
to
take
him
off
,
and
put
his
son
there
instead
?
 
<EOS>
I
do
n't
know
whether
the
Queen
really
pitied
him
at
this
pass
,
but
she
began
to
cry
;
so
,
the
Bishop
said
,
Well
,
my
Lords
and
Gentlemen
,
what
do
you
think
,
upon
the
whole
,
of
sending
down
to
Kenilworth
,
and
seeing
if
His
Majesty
(
God
bless
him
,
and
forbid
we
should
depose
him
!
)
<EOS>
wo
n't
resign
?
  
<EOS>
My
Lords
and
Gentlemen
thought
it
a
good
notion
,
so
a
deputation
of
them
went
down
to
Kenilworth
;
and
there
the
King
came
into
the
great
hall
of
the
Castle
,
commonly
dressed
in
a
poor
black
gown
;
and
when
he
saw
a
certain
bishop
among
them
,
fell
down
,
poor
feeble
-
headed
man
,
and
made
a
wretched
spectacle
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Somebody
lifted
him
up
,
and
then
SIR
WILLIAM
TRUSSEL
,
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
almost
frightened
him
to
death
by
making
him
a
tremendous
speech
to
the
effect
that
he
was
no
longer
a
King
,
and
that
everybody
renounced
allegiance
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
,
SIR
THOMAS
BLOUNT
,
the
Steward
of
the
Household
,
nearly
finished
him
,
by
coming
forward
and
breaking
his
white
wand
---
which
was
a
ceremony
only
performed
at
a
King
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
Being
asked
in
this
pressing
manner
what
he
thought
of
resigning
,
the
King
said
he
thought
it
was
the
best
thing
he
could
do
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
did
it
,
and
they
proclaimed
his
son
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
wish
I
could
close
his
history
by
saying
that
he
lived
a
harmless
life
in
the
Castle
and
the
Castle
gardens
at
Kenilworth
,
many
years
---
that
he
had
a
favourite
,
and
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
---
and
,
having
that
,
wanted
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
shamefully
humiliated
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
outraged
,
and
slighted
,
and
had
dirty
water
from
ditches
given
him
to
shave
with
,
and
wept
and
said
he
would
have
clean
warm
water
,
and
was
altogether
very
miserable
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
moved
from
this
castle
to
that
castle
,
and
from
that
castle
to
the
other
castle
,
because
this
lord
or
that
lord
,
or
the
other
lord
,
was
too
kind
to
him
:
 
until
<EOS>
at
last
he
came
to
Berkeley
Castle
,
near
the
River
Severn
,
where
(
the
Lord
Berkeley
being
then
ill
and
absent
)
<EOS>
he
fell
into
the
hands
of
two
black
ruffians
,
called
THOMAS
GOURNAY
and
WILLIAM
OGLE
.
  
<EOS>
One
night
---
it
was
the
night
of
September
the
twenty
-
first
,
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
twenty
-
seven
---
dreadful
screams
were
heard
,
by
the
startled
people
in
the
neighbouring
town
,
ringing
through
the
thick
walls
of
the
Castle
,
and
the
dark
,
deep
night
;
and
they
said
,
as
they
were
thus
horribly
awakened
from
their
sleep
,
"
May
Heaven
be
merciful
to
the
King
;
for
those
cries
forbode
that
no
good
is
being
done
to
him
in
his
dismal
prison
!
"
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
he
was
dead
---
not
bruised
,
or
stabbed
,
or
marked
upon
the
body
,
but
much
distorted
in
the
face
;
and
it
was
whispered
afterwards
,
that
those
two
villains
,
Gournay
and
Ogle
,
had
burnt
up
his
inside
with
a
red
-
hot
iron
.
  
<EOS>
If
you
ever
come
near
Gloucester
,
and
see
the
centre
tower
of
its
beautiful
Cathedral
,
with
its
four
rich
pinnacles
,
rising
lightly
in
the
air
;
you
may
remember
that
the
wretched
Edward
the
Second
was
buried
in
the
old
abbey
of
that
ancient
city
,
at
forty
-
three
years
old
,
after
being
for
nineteen
years
and
a
half
a
perfectly
incapable
King
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
Third
    
ROGER
MORTIMER
,
the
Queen
's
lover
(
who
escaped
to
France
in
the
last
chapter
)
,
was
far
from
profiting
by
the
examples
he
had
had
of
the
fate
of
favourites
.
 
<EOS>
Having
,
through
the
Queen
's
influence
,
come
into
possession
of
the
estates
of
the
two
Despensers
,
he
became
extremely
proud
and
ambitious
,
and
sought
to
be
the
real
ruler
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
King
,
who
was
crowned
at
fourteen
years
of
age
with
all
the
usual
solemnities
,
resolved
not
to
bear
this
,
and
soon
pursued
Mortimer
to
his
ruin
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
themselves
were
not
fond
of
Mortimer
---
first
,
because
he
was
a
Royal
favourite
;
secondly
,
because
he
was
supposed
to
have
helped
to
make
a
peace
with
Scotland
which
now
took
place
,
and
in
virtue
of
which
the
young
King
's
sister
Joan
,
only
seven
years
old
,
was
promised
in
marriage
to
David
,
the
son
and
heir
of
Robert
Bruce
,
who
was
only
five
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
The
nobles
hated
Mortimer
because
of
his
pride
,
riches
,
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
They
went
so
far
as
to
take
up
arms
against
him
;
but
were
obliged
to
submit
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Kent
,
one
of
those
who
did
so
,
but
who
afterwards
went
over
to
Mortimer
and
the
Queen
,
was
made
an
example
of
in
the
following
cruel
manner
:
  
<EOS>
He
seems
to
have
been
anything
but
a
wise
old
earl
;
and
he
was
persuaded
by
the
agents
of
the
favourite
and
the
Queen
,
that
poor
King
Edward
the
Second
was
not
really
dead
;
and
thus
was
betrayed
into
writing
letters
favouring
his
rightful
claim
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
This
was
made
out
to
be
high
treason
,
and
he
was
tried
,
found
guilty
,
and
sentenced
to
be
executed
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
the
poor
old
lord
outside
the
town
of
Winchester
,
and
there
kept
him
waiting
some
three
or
four
hours
until
they
could
find
somebody
to
cut
off
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
a
convict
said
he
would
do
it
,
if
the
government
would
pardon
him
in
return
;
and
they
gave
him
the
pardon
;
and
at
one
blow
he
put
the
Earl
of
Kent
out
of
his
last
suspense
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
Queen
was
in
France
,
she
had
found
a
lovely
and
good
young
lady
,
named
Philippa
,
who
she
thought
would
make
an
excellent
wife
for
her
son
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
King
married
this
lady
,
soon
after
he
came
to
the
throne
;
and
her
first
child
,
Edward
,
Prince
of
Wales
,
afterwards
became
celebrated
,
as
we
shall
presently
see
,
under
the
famous
title
of
EDWARD
THE
BLACK
PRINCE
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
King
,
thinking
the
time
ripe
for
the
downfall
of
Mortimer
,
took
counsel
with
Lord
Montacute
how
he
should
proceed
.
<EOS>
A
Parliament
was
going
to
be
held
at
Nottingham
,
and
that
lord
recommended
that
the
favourite
should
be
seized
by
night
in
Nottingham
Castle
,
where
he
was
sure
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
this
,
like
many
other
things
,
was
more
easily
said
than
done
;
because
,
to
guard
against
treachery
,
the
great
gates
of
the
Castle
were
locked
every
night
,
and
the
great
keys
were
carried
up
-
stairs
to
the
Queen
,
who
laid
them
under
her
own
pillow
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Castle
had
a
governor
,
and
the
governor
being
Lord
Montacute
's
friend
,
confided
to
him
how
he
knew
of
a
secret
passage
underground
,
hidden
from
observation
by
the
weeds
and
brambles
with
which
it
was
overgrown
;
and
how
,
through
that
passage
,
the
conspirators
might
enter
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
and
go
straight
to
Mortimer
's
room
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
upon
a
certain
dark
night
,
at
midnight
,
they
made
their
way
through
this
dismal
place
:
 
startling
the
rats
,
and
frightening
the
owls
and
bats
:
 
and
came
safely
to
the
bottom
of
the
main
tower
of
the
Castle
,
where
the
King
met
them
,
and
took
them
up
a
profoundly
-
dark
staircase
in
a
deep
silence
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
heard
the
voice
of
Mortimer
in
council
with
some
friends
;
and
bursting
into
the
room
with
a
sudden
noise
,
took
him
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
cried
out
from
her
bed
-
chamber
,
"
Oh
,
my
sweet
son
,
my
dear
son
,
spare
my
gentle
Mortimer
!
"
<EOS>
They
carried
him
off
,
however
;
and
,
before
the
next
Parliament
,
accused
him
of
having
made
differences
between
the
young
King
and
his
mother
,
and
of
having
brought
about
the
death
of
the
Earl
of
Kent
,
and
even
of
the
late
King
;
for
,
as
you
know
by
this
time
,
when
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
a
man
in
those
old
days
,
they
were
not
very
particular
of
what
they
accused
him
.
 
<EOS>
Mortimer
was
found
guilty
of
all
this
,
and
was
sentenced
to
be
hanged
at
Tyburn
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
shut
his
mother
up
in
genteel
confinement
,
where
she
passed
the
rest
of
her
life
;
and
now
he
became
King
in
earnest
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
effort
he
made
was
to
conquer
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
lords
who
had
lands
in
Scotland
,
finding
that
their
rights
were
not
respected
under
the
late
peace
,
made
war
on
their
own
account
:
choosing
for
their
general
,
Edward
,
the
son
of
John
Baliol
,
who
made
such
a
vigorous
fight
,
that
in
less
than
two
months
he
won
the
whole
Scottish
Kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
joined
,
when
thus
triumphant
,
by
the
King
and
Parliament
;
and
he
and
the
King
in
person
besieged
the
Scottish
forces
in
Berwick
.
 
<EOS>
The
whole
Scottish
army
coming
to
the
assistance
of
their
countrymen
,
such
a
furious
battle
ensued
,
that
thirty
thousand
men
are
said
to
have
been
killed
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Baliol
was
then
crowned
King
of
Scotland
,
doing
homage
to
the
King
of
England
;
but
little
came
of
his
successes
after
all
,
for
the
Scottish
men
rose
against
him
,
within
no
very
long
time
,
and
David
Bruce
came
back
within
ten
years
and
took
his
kingdom
.
  
<EOS>
France
was
a
far
richer
country
than
Scotland
,
and
the
King
had
a
much
greater
mind
to
conquer
it
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
let
Scotland
alone
,
and
pretended
that
he
had
a
claim
to
the
French
throne
in
right
of
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
,
in
reality
,
no
claim
at
all
;
but
that
mattered
little
in
those
times
.
 
<EOS>
He
brought
over
to
his
cause
many
little
princes
and
sovereigns
,
and
even
courted
the
alliance
of
the
people
of
Flanders
---
a
busy
,
working
community
,
who
had
very
small
respect
for
kings
,
and
whose
head
man
was
a
brewer
.
 
<EOS>
With
such
forces
as
he
raised
by
these
means
,
Edward
invaded
France
;
but
he
did
little
by
that
,
except
run
into
debt
in
carrying
on
the
war
to
the
extent
of
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
year
he
did
better
;
gaining
a
great
sea
-
fight
in
the
harbour
of
Sluys
.
 
<EOS>
This
success
,
however
,
was
very
shortlived
,
for
the
Flemings
took
fright
at
the
siege
of
Saint
Omer
and
ran
away
,
leaving
their
weapons
and
baggage
behind
them
.
 
<EOS>
Philip
,
the
French
King
,
coming
up
with
his
army
,
and
Edward
being
very
anxious
to
decide
the
war
,
proposed
to
settle
the
difference
by
single
combat
with
him
,
or
by
a
fight
of
one
hundred
knights
on
each
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
King
said
,
he
thanked
him
;
but
being
very
well
as
he
was
,
he
would
rather
not
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
some
skirmishing
and
talking
,
a
short
peace
was
made
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
soon
broken
by
King
Edward
's
favouring
the
cause
of
John
,
Earl
of
Montford
;
a
French
nobleman
,
who
asserted
a
claim
of
his
own
against
the
French
King
,
and
offered
to
do
homage
to
England
for
the
Crown
of
France
,
if
he
could
obtain
it
through
England
's
help
.
 
<EOS>
This
French
lord
,
himself
,
was
soon
defeated
by
the
French
King
's
son
,
and
shut
up
in
a
tower
in
Paris
;
but
his
wife
,
a
courageous
and
beautiful
woman
,
who
is
said
to
have
had
the
courage
of
a
man
,
and
the
heart
of
a
lion
,
assembled
the
people
of
Brittany
,
where
she
then
was
;
and
,
showing
them
her
infant
son
,
made
many
pathetic
entreaties
to
them
not
to
desert
her
and
their
young
Lord
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
fire
at
this
appeal
,
and
rallied
round
her
in
the
strong
castle
of
Hennebon
.
 
<EOS>
Here
she
was
not
only
besieged
without
by
the
French
under
Charles
de
Blois
,
but
was
endangered
within
by
a
dreary
old
bishop
,
who
was
always
representing
to
the
people
what
horrors
they
must
undergo
if
they
were
faithful
---
first
from
famine
,
and
afterwards
from
fire
and
sword
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
noble
lady
,
whose
heart
never
failed
her
,
encouraged
her
soldiers
by
her
own
example
;
went
from
post
to
post
like
a
great
general
;
even
mounted
on
horseback
fully
armed
,
and
,
issuing
from
the
castle
by
a
by
-
path
,
fell
upon
the
French
camp
,
set
fire
to
the
tents
,
and
threw
the
whole
force
into
disorder
.
 
<EOS>
This
done
,
she
got
safely
back
to
Hennebon
again
,
and
was
received
with
loud
shouts
of
joy
by
the
defenders
of
the
castle
,
who
had
given
her
up
for
lost
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
were
now
very
short
of
provisions
,
however
,
and
as
they
could
not
dine
off
enthusiasm
,
and
as
the
old
bishop
was
always
saying
,
"
I
told
you
what
it
would
come
to
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
they
began
to
lose
heart
,
and
to
talk
of
yielding
the
castle
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
brave
Countess
retiring
to
an
upper
room
and
looking
with
great
grief
out
to
sea
,
where
she
expected
relief
from
England
,
saw
,
at
this
very
time
,
the
English
ships
in
the
distance
,
and
was
relieved
and
rescued
!
 
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Manning
,
the
English
commander
,
<EOS>
so
admired
her
courage
,
that
,
being
come
into
the
castle
with
the
English
knights
,
and
having
made
a
feast
there
,
he
assaulted
the
French
by
way
of
dessert
,
and
beat
them
off
triumphantly
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
and
the
knights
came
back
to
the
castle
with
great
joy
;
and
the
Countess
who
had
watched
them
from
a
high
tower
,
thanked
them
with
all
her
heart
,
and
kissed
them
every
one
.
  
<EOS>
This
noble
lady
distinguished
herself
afterwards
in
a
sea
-
fight
with
the
French
off
Guernsey
,
when
she
was
on
her
way
to
England
to
ask
for
more
troops
.
 
<EOS>
Her
great
spirit
roused
another
lady
,
the
wife
of
another
French
lord
(
whom
the
French
King
very
barbarously
murdered
)
,
to
distinguish
herself
scarcely
less
.
 
<EOS>
The
time
was
fast
coming
,
however
,
when
Edward
,
Prince
of
Wales
,
was
to
be
the
great
star
of
this
French
and
English
war
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
month
of
July
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
-
six
,
when
the
King
embarked
at
Southampton
for
France
,
with
an
army
of
about
thirty
thousand
men
in
all
,
attended
by
the
Prince
of
Wales
and
by
several
of
the
chief
nobles
.
 
<EOS>
He
landed
at
La
Hogue
in
Normandy
;
and
,
burning
and
destroying
as
he
went
,
according
to
custom
,
advanced
up
the
left
bank
of
the
River
Seine
,
and
fired
the
small
towns
even
close
to
Paris
;
but
,
being
watched
from
the
right
bank
of
the
river
by
the
French
King
and
all
his
army
,
it
came
to
this
at
last
,
that
Edward
found
himself
,
on
Saturday
the
twenty
-
sixth
of
August
,
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
forty
-
six
,
on
a
rising
ground
behind
the
little
French
village
of
Crecy
,
face
to
face
with
the
French
King
's
force
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
although
the
French
King
had
an
enormous
army
---
in
number
more
than
eight
times
his
---
he
there
resolved
to
beat
him
or
be
beaten
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
Prince
,
assisted
by
the
Earl
of
Oxford
and
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
led
the
first
division
of
the
English
army
;
two
other
great
Earls
led
the
second
;
and
the
King
,
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
morning
dawned
,
the
King
received
the
sacrament
,
and
heard
prayers
,
and
then
,
mounted
on
horseback
with
a
white
wand
in
his
hand
,
rode
from
company
to
company
,
and
rank
to
rank
,
cheering
and
encouraging
both
officers
and
men
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
whole
army
breakfasted
,
each
man
sitting
on
the
ground
where
he
had
stood
;
and
then
they
remained
quietly
on
the
ground
with
their
weapons
ready
.
  
<EOS>
Up
came
the
French
King
with
all
his
great
force
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
dark
and
angry
weather
;
there
was
an
eclipse
of
the
sun
;
there
was
a
thunder
-
storm
,
accompanied
with
tremendous
rain
;
the
frightened
birds
flew
screaming
above
the
soldiers
"
heads
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
captain
in
the
French
army
advised
the
French
King
,
who
was
by
no
means
cheerful
,
not
to
begin
the
battle
until
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
taking
this
advice
,
gave
the
word
to
halt
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
those
behind
not
understanding
it
,
or
desiring
to
be
foremost
with
the
rest
,
came
pressing
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
roads
for
a
great
distance
were
covered
with
this
immense
army
,
and
with
the
common
people
from
the
villages
,
who
were
flourishing
their
rude
weapons
,
and
making
a
great
noise
.
<EOS>
Owing
to
these
circumstances
,
the
French
army
advanced
in
the
greatest
confusion
;
every
French
lord
doing
what
he
liked
with
his
own
men
,
and
putting
out
the
men
of
every
other
French
lord
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
their
King
relied
strongly
upon
a
great
body
of
cross
-
bowmen
from
Genoa
;
and
these
he
ordered
to
the
front
to
begin
the
battle
,
on
finding
that
he
could
not
stop
it
.
 
<EOS>
They
shouted
once
,
they
shouted
twice
,
they
shouted
three
times
,
to
alarm
the
English
archers
;
but
,
the
English
would
have
heard
them
shout
three
thousand
times
and
would
have
never
moved
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
the
cross
-
bowmen
went
forward
a
little
,
and
began
to
discharge
their
bolts
;
upon
which
,
the
English
let
fly
such
a
hail
of
arrows
,
that
the
Genoese
speedily
made
off
---
for
their
cross
-
bows
,
besides
being
heavy
to
carry
,
required
to
be
wound
up
with
a
handle
,
and
consequently
took
time
to
re
-
load
;
the
English
,
on
the
other
hand
,
could
discharge
their
arrows
almost
as
fast
as
the
arrows
could
fly
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
French
King
saw
the
Genoese
turning
,
he
cried
out
to
his
men
to
kill
those
scoundrels
,
who
were
doing
harm
instead
of
service
.
 
<EOS>
This
increased
the
confusion
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
English
archers
,
continuing
to
shoot
as
fast
as
ever
,
shot
down
great
numbers
of
the
French
soldiers
and
knights
;
whom
certain
sly
Cornish
-
men
and
Welshmen
,
from
the
English
army
,
creeping
along
the
ground
,
despatched
with
great
knives
.
  
<EOS>
The
Prince
and
his
division
were
at
this
time
so
hard
-
pressed
,
that
the
Earl
of
Warwick
sent
a
message
to
the
King
,
who
was
overlooking
the
battle
from
a
windmill
,
beseeching
him
to
send
more
aid
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
my
son
killed
?
"
said
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sire
,
please
God
,
"
returned
the
messenger
.
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
wounded
?
"
said
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sire
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Is
he
thrown
to
the
ground
?
"
said
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
"
No
,
sire
,
not
so
;
but
,
he
is
very
hard
-
pressed
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
the
King
,
"
go
back
to
those
who
sent
you
,
and
tell
them
I
shall
send
no
aid
;
because
I
set
my
heart
upon
my
son
proving
himself
this
day
a
brave
knight
,
and
because
I
am
resolved
,
please
God
,
that
the
honour
of
a
great
victory
shall
be
his
!
"
  
<EOS>
These
bold
words
,
being
reported
to
the
Prince
and
his
division
,
so
raised
their
spirits
,
that
they
fought
better
than
ever
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
of
France
charged
gallantly
with
his
men
many
times
;
but
it
was
of
no
use
.
 
<EOS>
Night
closing
in
,
his
horse
was
killed
under
him
by
an
English
arrow
,
and
the
knights
and
nobles
who
had
clustered
thick
about
him
early
in
the
day
,
were
now
completely
scattered
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
some
of
his
few
remaining
followers
led
him
off
the
field
by
force
since
he
would
not
retire
of
himself
,
and
they
journeyed
away
to
Amiens
.
 
<EOS>
The
victorious
English
,
lighting
their
watch
-
fires
,
made
merry
on
the
field
,
and
the
King
,
riding
to
meet
his
gallant
son
,
took
him
in
his
arms
,
kissed
him
,
and
told
him
that
he
had
acted
nobly
,
and
proved
himself
worthy
of
the
day
and
of
the
crown
.
<EOS>
While
it
was
yet
night
,
King
Edward
was
hardly
aware
of
the
great
victory
he
had
gained
;
but
,
next
day
,
it
was
discovered
that
eleven
princes
,
twelve
hundred
knights
,
and
thirty
thousand
common
men
lay
dead
upon
the
French
side
.
 
<EOS>
Among
these
was
the
King
of
Bohemia
,
an
old
blind
man
;
who
,
having
been
told
that
his
son
was
wounded
in
the
battle
,
and
that
no
force
could
stand
against
the
Black
Prince
,
called
to
him
two
knights
,
put
himself
on
horse
-
back
between
them
,
fastened
the
three
bridles
together
,
and
dashed
in
among
the
English
,
where
he
was
presently
slain
.
 
<EOS>
He
bore
as
his
crest
three
white
ostrich
feathers
,
with
the
motto
ICH
DIEN
,
signifying
in
English
"
I
serve
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
crest
and
motto
were
taken
by
the
Prince
of
Wales
in
remembrance
of
that
famous
day
,
and
have
been
borne
by
the
Prince
of
Wales
ever
since
.
  
<EOS>
Five
days
after
this
great
battle
,
the
King
laid
siege
to
Calais
.
<EOS>
This
siege
---
ever
afterwards
memorable
---
lasted
nearly
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
In
order
to
starve
the
inhabitants
out
,
King
Edward
built
so
many
wooden
houses
for
the
lodgings
of
his
troops
,
that
it
is
said
their
quarters
looked
like
a
second
Calais
suddenly
sprung
around
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
Early
in
the
siege
,
the
governor
of
the
town
drove
out
what
he
called
the
useless
mouths
,
to
the
number
of
seventeen
hundred
persons
,
men
and
women
,
young
and
old
.
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
allowed
them
to
pass
through
his
lines
,
and
even
fed
them
,
and
dismissed
them
with
money
;
but
,
later
in
the
siege
,
he
was
not
so
merciful
---
five
hundred
more
,
who
were
afterwards
driven
out
,
dying
of
starvation
and
misery
.
 
<EOS>
The
garrison
were
so
hard
-
pressed
at
last
,
that
they
sent
a
letter
to
King
Philip
,
telling
him
that
they
had
eaten
all
the
horses
,
all
the
dogs
,
and
all
the
rats
and
mice
that
could
be
found
in
the
place
;
and
,
that
if
he
did
not
relieve
them
,
they
must
either
surrender
to
the
English
,
or
eat
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
Philip
made
one
effort
to
give
them
relief
;
but
they
were
so
hemmed
in
by
the
English
power
,
that
he
could
not
succeed
,
and
was
fain
to
leave
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
they
hoisted
the
English
flag
,
and
surrendered
to
King
Edward
.
 
<EOS>
"
Tell
your
general
,
"
said
he
to
the
humble
messengers
who
came
out
of
the
town
,
"
that
I
require
to
have
sent
here
,
six
of
the
most
distinguished
citizens
,
bare
-
legged
,
and
in
their
shirts
,
with
ropes
about
their
necks
;
and
let
those
six
men
bring
with
them
the
keys
of
the
castle
and
the
town
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
When
the
Governor
of
Calais
related
this
to
the
people
in
the
Market
-
place
,
there
was
great
weeping
and
distress
;
in
the
midst
of
which
,
one
worthy
citizen
,
named
Eustace
de
Saint
Pierre
,
rose
up
and
said
,
that
if
the
six
men
required
were
not
sacrificed
,
the
whole
population
would
be
;
therefore
,
he
offered
himself
as
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
bright
example
,
five
other
worthy
citizens
rose
up
one
after
another
,
and
offered
themselves
to
save
the
rest
.
 
<EOS>
The
Governor
,
who
was
too
badly
wounded
to
be
able
to
walk
,
mounted
a
poor
old
horse
that
had
not
been
eaten
,
and
conducted
these
good
men
to
the
gate
,
while
all
the
people
cried
and
mourned
.
  
<EOS>
Edward
received
them
wrathfully
,
and
ordered
the
heads
of
the
whole
six
to
be
struck
off
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
good
Queen
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
besought
the
King
to
give
them
up
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
replied
,
"
I
wish
you
had
been
somewhere
else
;
but
I
can
not
refuse
you
.
"
 
<EOS>
So
she
had
them
properly
dressed
,
made
a
feast
for
them
,
and
sent
them
back
with
a
handsome
present
,
to
the
great
rejoicing
of
the
whole
camp
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
people
of
Calais
loved
the
daughter
to
whom
she
gave
birth
soon
afterwards
,
for

Now
came
that
terrible
disease
,
the
Plague
,
into
Europe
,
hurrying
from
the
heart
of
China
;
and
killed
the
wretched
people
---
especially
the
poor
---
in
such
enormous
numbers
,
that
one
-
half
of
the
inhabitants
of
England
are
related
to
have
died
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
It
killed
the
cattle
,
in
great
numbers
,
too
;
and
so
few
working
men
remained
alive
,
that
there
were
not
enough
left
to
till
the
ground
.
  
<EOS>
After
eight
years
of
differing
and
quarrelling
,
the
Prince
of
Wales
again
invaded
France
with
an
army
of
sixty
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
through
the
south
of
the
country
,
burning
and
plundering
<EOS>
wheresoever
he
went
;
while
his
father
,
who
had
still
the
Scottish
war
upon
his
hands
,
did
the
like
in
Scotland
,
but
was
harassed
and
worried
in
his
retreat
from
that
country
by
the
Scottish
men
,
who
repaid
his
cruelties
with
interest
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
King
,
Philip
,
was
now
dead
,
and
was
succeeded
by
his
son
John
.
 
<EOS>
The
Black
Prince
,
called
by
that
name
from
the
colour
of
the
armour
he
wore
to
set
off
his
fair
complexion
,
continuing
to
burn
and
destroy
in
France
,
roused
John
into
determined
opposition
;
and
so
cruel
had
the
Black
Prince
been
in
his
campaign
,
and
so
severely
had
the
French
peasants
suffered
,
that
he
could
not
find
one
who
,
for
love
,
or
money
,
or
the
fear
of
death
,
would
tell
him
what
the
French
King
was
doing
,
or
where
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
it
happened
that
he
came
upon
the
French
King
's
forces
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
near
the
town
of
Poitiers
,
and
found
that
the
whole
neighbouring
country
was
occupied
by
a
vast
French
army
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
help
us
!
"
said
the
Black
Prince
,
"
we
must
make
the
best
of
it
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
So
,
on
a
Sunday
morning
,
the
eighteenth
of
September
,
the
Prince
whose
army
was
now
reduced
to
ten
thousand
men
in
all
---
prepared
to
give
battle
to
the
French
King
,
who
had
sixty
thousand
horse
alone
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
so
engaged
,
there
came
riding
from
the
French
camp
,
a
Cardinal
,
who
had
persuaded
John
to
let
him
offer
terms
,
and
try
to
save
the
shedding
of
Christian
blood
.
 
<EOS>
"
Save
my
honour
,
"
said
the
Prince
to
this
good
priest
,
"
and
save
the
honour
of
my
army
,
and
I
will
make
any
reasonable
terms
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
offered
to
give
up
all
the
towns
,
castles
,
and
prisoners
,
he
had
taken
,
and
to
swear
to
make
no
war
in
France
for
seven
years
;
but
,
as
John
would
hear
of
nothing
but
his
surrender
,
with
a
hundred
of
his
chief
knights
,
the
treaty
was
broken
off
,
and
<EOS>
the
Prince
said
quietly
---
"
God
defend
the
right
;
we
shall
fight
to
-
morrow
.
"
  
<EOS>
Therefore
,
on
the
Monday
morning
,
at
break
of
day
,
the
two
armies
prepared
for
battle
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
were
posted
in
a
strong
place
,
which
could
only
be
approached
by
one
narrow
lane
,
skirted
by
hedges
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
attacked
them
by
this
lane
;
but
were
so
galled
and
slain
by
English
arrows
from
behind
the
hedges
,
that
they
were
forced
to
retreat
.
 
<EOS>
Then
went
six
hundred
English
bowmen
round
about
,
and
,
coming
upon
the
rear
of
the
French
army
,
rained
arrows
on
them
thick
and
fast
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
knights
,
thrown
into
confusion
,
quitted
their
banners
and
dispersed
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
Said
Sir
John
Chandos
to
the
Prince
,
"
Ride
forward
,
noble
Prince
,
and
the
day
is
yours
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
of
France
is
so
valiant
a
gentleman
,
<EOS>
that
I
know
he
will
never
fly
,
and
may
be
taken
prisoner
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Said
the
Prince
to
this
,
"
Advance
,
English
banners
,
in
the
name
of
God
and
St
George
!
"
<EOS>
and
on
they
pressed
until
they
came
up
with
the
French
King
,
fighting
fiercely
with
his
battle
-
axe
,
and
,
when
all
his
nobles
had
forsaken
him
,
attended
faithfully
to
the
last
by
his
youngest
son
Philip
,
only
sixteen
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
Father
and
son
fought
well
,
and
the
King
had
already
two
wounds
in
his
face
,
and
had
been
beaten
down
,
when
he
at
last
delivered
himself
to
a
banished
French
knight
,
and
gave
him
his
right
-
hand
glove
in
token
that
he
had
done
so
.
  
<EOS>
The
Black
Prince
was
generous
as
well
as
brave
,
and
he
invited
his
royal
prisoner
to
supper
in
his
tent
,
and
waited
upon
him
at
table
,
and
,
when
they
afterwards
rode
into
London
in
a
gorgeous
procession
,
mounted
the
French
King
on
a
fine
cream
-
coloured
horse
,
and
rode
at
his
side
on
a
little
pony
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
all
very
kind
,
but
I
think
it
was
,
perhaps
,
a
little
theatrical
too
,
and
has
been
made
more
meritorious
than
it
deserved
to
be
;
especially
as
I
am
inclined
to
think
that
the
greatest
kindness
to
the
King
of
France
would
have
been
not
to
have
shown
him
to
the
people
at
all
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
must
be
said
,
for
these
acts
of
politeness
,
that
,
in
course
of
time
,
they
did
much
to
soften
the
horrors
of
war
and
the
passions
of
conquerors
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
long
,
long
time
before
the
common
soldiers
began
to
have
the
benefit
of
such
courtly
deeds
;
but
they
did
at
last
;
and
thus
it
is
possible
that
a
poor
soldier
who
asked
for
quarter
at
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
or
any
other
such
great
fight
,
may
have
owed
his
life
indirectly
to
Edward
the
Black
Prince
.
  
<EOS>
At
this
time
there
stood
in
the
Strand
,
in
London
,
a
palace
called
the
Savoy
,
which
was
given
up
to
the
captive
King
of
France
and
his
son
for
their
residence
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
King
of
Scotland
had
now
been
King
Edward
's
captive
for
eleven
years
too
,
his
success
was
,
at
this
time
,
tolerably
complete
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
business
was
settled
by
the
prisoner
being
released
under
the
title
of
Sir
David
,
King
of
Scotland
,
and
by
his
engaging
to
pay
a
large
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
The
state
of
France
encouraged
England
to
propose
harder
terms
to
that
country
,
where
the
people
rose
against
the
unspeakable
cruelty
and
barbarity
of
its
nobles
;
where
the
nobles
rose
in
turn
against
the
people
;
where
the
most
frightful
outrages
were
committed
on
all
sides
;
and
where
the
insurrection
of
the
peasants
,
called
the
insurrection
of
the
Jacquerie
,
from
Jacques
,
a
common
Christian
name
among
the
country
people
of
France
,
awakened
terrors
and
hatreds
that
have
scarcely
yet
passed
away
.
 
<EOS>
A
treaty
called
the
Great
Peace
,
was
at
last
signed
,
under
which
King
Edward
agreed
to
give
up
the
greater
part
of
his
conquests
,
and
King
John
to
pay
,
within
six
years
,
a
ransom
of
three
million
crowns
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
beset
by
his
own
nobles
and
courtiers
for
having
yielded
to
these
conditions
---
though
they
could
help
him
to
no
better
---
<EOS>
that
he
came
back
of
his
own
will
to
his
old
palace
-
prison
of
the
Savoy
,
and
there
died
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
Sovereign
of
Castile
at
that
time
,
called
PEDRO
THE
CRUEL
,
who
deserved
the
name
remarkably
well
:
 
<EOS>
having
committed
,
among
other
cruelties
,
a
variety
of
murders
.
 
<EOS>
This
amiable
monarch
being
driven
from
his
throne
for
his
crimes
,
went
to
the
province
of
Bordeaux
,
where
the
Black
Prince
---
now
married
to
his
cousin
JOAN
,
a
pretty
widow
---
was
residing
,
and
besought
his
help
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
,
who
took
to
him
much
more
kindly
than
a
prince
of
such
fame
ought
to
have
taken
to
such
a
ruffian
,
readily
listened
to
his
fair
promises
,
and
agreeing
to
help
him
,
sent
secret
orders
to
some
troublesome
disbanded
soldiers
of
his
and
his
father
's
,
who
called
themselves
the
Free
Companions
,
and
who
had
been
a
pest
to
the
French
people
,
for
some
time
,
to
aid
this
Pedro
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
,
himself
,
going
into
Spain
to
head
the
army
of
relief
,
soon
set
Pedro
on
his
throne
again
---
where
he
no
sooner
found
himself
,
than
,
<EOS>
of
course
,
he
behaved
like
the
villain
he
was
,
broke
his
word
without
the
least
shame
,
and
abandoned
all
the
promises
he
had
made
to
the
Black
Prince
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
it
had
cost
the
Prince
a
good
deal
of
money
to
pay
soldiers
to
support
this
murderous
King
;
and
finding
himself
,
when
he
came
back
disgusted
to
Bordeaux
,
not
only
in
bad
health
,
but
deeply
in
debt
,
he
began
to
tax
his
French
subjects
to
pay
his
creditors
.
 
<EOS>
They
appealed
to
the
French
King
,
CHARLES
;
war
again
broke
out
;
and
the
French
town
of
Limoges
,
which
the
Prince
had
greatly
benefited
,
went
over
to
the
French
King
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
he
ravaged
the
province
of
which
it
was
the
capital
;
burnt
,
and
plundered
,
and
killed
in
the
old
sickening
way
;
and
refused
mercy
to
the
prisoners
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
taken
in
the
offending
town
,
though
he
was
so
ill
<EOS>
and
so
much
in
need
of
pity
himself
from
Heaven
,
that
he
was
carried
in
a
litter
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
to
come
home
and
make
himself
popular
with
the
people
and
Parliament
,
and
he
died
on
Trinity
Sunday
,
the
eighth
of
June
,
one
thousand
three
hundred
and
seventy
-
six
,
at
forty
-
six
years
old
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
nation
mourned
for
him
as
one
of
the
most
renowned
and
beloved
princes
it
had
ever
had
;
and
he
was
buried
with
great
lamentations
in
Canterbury
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
Near
to
the
tomb
of
Edward
the
Confessor
,
his
monument
,
with
his
figure
,
carved
in
stone
,
and
represented
in
the
old
black
armour
,
lying
on
its
back
,
may
be
seen
at
this
day
,
with
an
ancient
coat
of
mail
,
a
helmet
,
and
a
pair
of
gauntlets
hanging
from
a
beam
above
it
,
which
most
people
like
to
believe
were
once
worn
by
the
Black
Prince
.
  
<EOS>
King
Edward
did
not
outlive
his
renowned
son
,
long
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
old
,
and
one
Alice
Perrers
,
a
beautiful
lady
,
had
contrived
to
make
him
so
fond
of
her
in
his
old
age
,
that
he
could
refuse
her
nothing
,
and
made
himself
ridiculous
.
 
<EOS>
She
little
deserved
his
love
,
or
---
what
I
dare
say
she
valued
a
great
deal
more
---
<EOS>
the
jewels
of
the
late
Queen
,
which
he
gave
her
among
other
rich
presents
.
 
<EOS>
She
took
the
very
ring
from
his
finger
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
he
died
,
and
left
him
to
be
pillaged
by
his
faithless
servants
.
 
<EOS>
Only
one
good
priest
was
true
to
him
,
and
attended
him
to
the
last
.
  
<EOS>
Besides
being
famous
for
the
great
victories
I
have
related
,
the
reign
of
King
Edward
the
Third
was
rendered
memorable
in
better
ways
,
by
the
growth
of
architecture
and
the
erection
of
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
In
better
ways
still
,
by
the
rising
up
of
WICKLIFFE
,
originally
a
poor
parish
priest
:
 
who
devoted
himself
to
exposing
,
with
wonderful
power
and
success
,
the
ambition
and
corruption
of
the
Pope
,
and
of
the
whole
church
of
which
he
was
the
head
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
those
Flemings
were
induced
to
come
to
England
in
this
reign
too
,
and
to
settle
in
Norfolk
,
where
they
made
better
woollen
cloths
than
the
English
had
ever
had
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
Order
of
the
Garter
(
a
very
fine
thing
in
its
way
,
but
hardly
so
important
as
good
clothes
for
the
nation
)
also
dates
from
this
period
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
is
said
to
have
picked
"
up
a
lady
's
garter
at
a
ball
,
and
to
have
said
,
HONI
SOIT
<EOS>
QUI
MAL
Y
PENSE
---
in
English
<EOS>
,
"
Evil
be
to
him
who
evil
thinks
of
it
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
courtiers
were
usually
glad
to
imitate
what
the
King
said
or
did
,
and
hence
from
a
slight
incident
the
Order
of
the
Garter
was
instituted
,
and
became
a
great
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
story
goes
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Richard
<EOS>
the
Second
    
RICHARD
,
son
of
the
Black
Prince
,
a
boy
eleven
years
of
age
,
succeeded
to
the
Crown
under
the
title
of
King
Richard
the
Second
.
<EOS>
The
whole
English
nation
were
ready
to
admire
him
for
the
sake
of
his
brave
father
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
lords
and
ladies
about
the
Court
,
they
declared
him
to
be
the
most
beautiful
,
the
wisest
,
and
the
best
---
even
of
princes
---
whom
the
lords
and
ladies
about
the
Court
,
generally
declare
to
be
the
most
beautiful
,
the
wisest
,
and
the
best
of
mankind
.
 
<EOS>
To
flatter
a
poor
boy
in
this
base
manner
was
not
a
very
likely
way
to
develop
whatever
good
was
in
him
;
and
it
brought
him
to
anything
but
a
good
or
happy
end
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
the
young
King
's
uncle
---
commonly
called
John
of
Gaunt
,
from
having
been
born
at
Ghent
,
which
the
common
people
so
pronounced
---
was
supposed
to
have
some
thoughts
of
the
throne
himself
;
but
,
as
he
was
not
popular
,
and
the
memory
of
the
Black
Prince
was
,
he
submitted
to
his
nephew
.
  
<EOS>
The
war
with
France
being
still
unsettled
,
the
Government
of
England
wanted
money
to
provide
for
the
expenses
that
might
arise
out
of
it
;
accordingly
a
certain
tax
,
called
the
Poll
-
tax
,
which
had
originated
in
the
last
reign
,
was
ordered
to
be
levied
on
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
tax
on
every
person
in
the
kingdom
,
male
and
female
,
above
the
age
of
fourteen
,
of
three
groats
(
or
three
four
-
penny
pieces
)
a
year
;
clergymen
were
charged
more
,
and
only
beggars
were
exempt
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
no
need
to
repeat
that
the
common
people
of
England
had
long
been
suffering
under
great
oppression
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
still
the
mere
slaves
of
the
lords
of
the
land
on
which
they
lived
,
and
were
on
most
occasions
harshly
and
unjustly
treated
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
they
had
begun
by
this
time
to
think
very
seriously
of
not
bearing
quite
so
much
;
and
,
probably
,
were
emboldened
by
that
French
insurrection
I
mentioned
in
the
last
chapter
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
of
Essex
rose
against
the
Poll
-
tax
,
and
being
severely
handled
by
the
government
officers
,
killed
some
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
very
time
one
of
the
tax
-
collectors
,
going
his
rounds
from
house
to
house
,
at
Dartford
in
Kent
came
to
the
cottage
of
one
WAT
,
a
tiler
by
trade
,
and
claimed
the
tax
upon
his
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
who
was
at
home
,
declared
that
she
was
under
the
age
of
fourteen
;
upon
that
,
the
collector
(
as
other
collectors
had
already
done
in
different
parts
of
England
)
behaved
in
a
savage
way
,
and
brutally
insulted
Wat
Tyler
's
daughter
.
 
<EOS>
The
daughter
screamed
,
the
mother
screamed
.
 
<EOS>
Wat
<EOS>
the
Tiler
,
who
was
at
work
not
far
off
,
ran
to
the
spot
,
and
did
what
any
honest
father
under
such
provocation
might
have
done
---
struck
the
collector
dead
at
a
blow
.
  
<EOS>
Instantly
the
people
of
that
town
uprose
as
one
man
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
Wat
Tyler
their
leader
;
they
joined
with
the
people
of
Essex
,
who
were
in
arms
under
a
priest
called
JACK
STRAW
;
they
took
out
of
prison
another
priest
named
JOHN
BALL
;
and
gathering
in
numbers
as
they
went
along
,
advanced
,
in
a
great
confused
army
of
poor
men
,
to
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
they
wanted
to
abolish
all
property
,
and
to
declare
all
men
equal
.
 
<EOS>
I
do
not
think
this
very
likely
;
because
they
stopped
the
travellers
on
the
roads
and
made
them
swear
to
be
true
to
King
Richard
and
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
they
at
all
disposed
to
injure
those
who
had
done
them
no
harm
,
merely
because
they
were
of
high
station
;
for
,
the
King
's
mother
,
who
had
to
pass
through
their
camp
at
Blackheath
,
on
her
way
to
her
young
son
,
lying
for
safety
in
the
Tower
of
London
,
had
merely
to
kiss
a
few
dirty
-
faced
rough
-
bearded
men
who
were
noisily
fond
of
royalty
,
and
so
got
away
in
perfect
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
the
whole
mass
marched
on
to
London
Bridge
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
drawbridge
in
the
middle
,
which
WILLIAM
WALWORTH
the
Mayor
caused
to
be
raised
to
prevent
their
coming
into
the
city
;
but
they
soon
terrified
the
citizens
into
lowering
it
again
,
and
spread
themselves
,
with
great
uproar
,
over
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
They
broke
open
the
prisons
;
they
burned
the
papers
in
Lambeth
Palace
;
they
destroyed
the
DUKE
OF
LANCASTER
'S
Palace
,
the
Savoy
,
in
the
Strand
,
said
to
be
the
most
beautiful
and
splendid
in
England
;
they
set
fire
to
the
books
and
documents
in
the
Temple
;
and
made
a
great
riot
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
these
outrages
were
committed
in
drunkenness
;
since
those
citizens
,
who
had
well
-
filled
cellars
,
were
only
too
glad
to
throw
them
open
to
save
the
rest
of
their
property
;
but
even
the
drunken
rioters
were
very
careful
to
steal
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
angry
with
one
man
,
who
was
seen
to
take
a
silver
cup
at
the
Savoy
Palace
,
and
put
it
in
his
breast
,
that
they
drowned
him
in
the
river
,
cup
and
all
.
  
<EOS>
The
young
King
had
been
taken
out
to
treat
with
them
before
they
committed
these
excesses
;
but
,
he
and
the
people
about
him
were
so
frightened
by
the
riotous
shouts
,
that
they
got
back
to
the
Tower
in
the
best
way
they
could
.
 
<EOS>
This
made
the
insurgents
bolder
;
so
they
went
on
rioting
away
,
striking
off
the
heads
of
those
who
did
not
,
at
a
moment
's
notice
,
declare
for
King
Richard
and
the
people
;
and
killing
as
many
of
the
unpopular
persons
whom
they
supposed
to
be
their
enemies
as
they
could
by
any
means
lay
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
passed
one
very
violent
day
,
and
then
proclamation
was
made
that
the
King
would
meet
them
at
Mile
-
end
,
and
grant
their
requests
.
  
<EOS>
The
rioters
went
to
Mile
-
end
to
the
number
of
sixty
thousand
,
and
the
King
met
them
there
,
and
to
the
King
the
rioters
peaceably
proposed
four
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
First
,
that
neither
they
,
nor
their
children
,
nor
any
coming
after
them
,
should
be
made
slaves
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Secondly
,
that
the
rent
of
land
should
be
fixed
at
a
certain
price
in
money
,
instead
of
being
paid
in
service
.
 
<EOS>
Thirdly
,
that
they
should
have
liberty
to
buy
and
sell
in
all
markets
and
public
places
,
like
other
free
men
.
 
<EOS>
Fourthly
,
that
they
should
be
pardoned
for
past
offences
.
 
<EOS>
Heaven
knows
,
there
was
nothing
very
unreasonable
in
these
proposals
!
 
<EOS>
The
young
King
deceitfully
pretended
to
think
so
,
and
kept
thirty
clerks
up
,
all
night
,
writing
out
a
charter
accordingly
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
Wat
Tyler
himself
wanted
more
than
this
.
 
<EOS>
He
wanted
the
entire
abolition
of
the
forest
laws
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
Mile
-
end
with
the
rest
,
but
,
while
that
meeting
was
being
held
,
broke
into
the
Tower
of
London
and
slew
the
archbishop
and
the
treasurer
,
for
whose
heads
the
people
had
cried
out
loudly
the
day
before
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
his
men
even
thrust
their
swords
into
the
bed
of
the
Princess
of
Wales
while
the
Princess
was
in
it
,
to
make
certain
that
none
of
their
enemies
were
concealed
there
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
Wat
and
his
men
still
continued
armed
,
and
rode
about
the
city
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
the
King
with
a
small
train
of
some
sixty
gentlemen
---
among
whom
was
WALWORTH
the
Mayor
---
rode
into
Smithfield
,
and
saw
Wat
and
his
people
at
a
little
distance
.
 
<EOS>
Says
Wat
to
his
men
,
"
There
is
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
go
speak
with
him
,
and
tell
him
what
we
want
.
"
  
<EOS>
Straightway
Wat
rode
up
to
him
,
and
began
to
talk
.
 
<EOS>
"
King
,
"
says
Wat
,
"
dost
thou
see
all
my
men
there
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Ah
,
"
says
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
?
"
  
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
says
Wat
,
"
they
are
all
at
my
command
,
and
have
sworn
to
do
whatever
I
bid
them
.
"
  
<EOS>
Some
declared
afterwards
that
as
Wat
said
this
,
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
King
's
bridle
.
 
<EOS>
Others
declared
that
he
was
seen
to
play
with
his
own
dagger
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
,
myself
,
that
he
just
spoke
to
the
King
like
a
rough
,
angry
man
as
he
was
,
and
did
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
he
was
expecting
no
attack
,
and
preparing
for
no
resistance
,
when
Walworth
the
Mayor
did
the
not
very
valiant
deed
of
drawing
a
short
sword
and
stabbing
him
in
the
throat
.
 
<EOS>
He
dropped
from
his
horse
,
and
one
of
the
King
's
people
speedily
finished
him
.
 
<EOS>
So
fell
Wat
Tyler
.
 
<EOS>
Fawners
and
flatterers
made
a
mighty
triumph
of
it
,
and
set
up
a
cry
which
will
occasionally
find
an
echo
to
this
day
.
 
<EOS>
But
Wat
was
a
hard
-
working
man
,
who
had
suffered
much
,
and
had
been
foully
outraged
;
and
it
is
probable
that
he
was
a
man
of
a
much
higher
nature
and
a
much
braver
spirit
than
any
of
the
parasites
who
exulted
then
,
or
have
exulted
since
,
over
his
defeat
.
  
<EOS>
Seeing
Wat
down
,
his
men
immediately
bent
their
bows
to
avenge
his
fall
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
young
King
had
not
had
presence
of
mind
at
that
dangerous
moment
,
both
he
and
the
Mayor
to
boot
,
might
have
followed
Tyler
pretty
fast
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
riding
up
to
the
crowd
,
cried
out
that
Tyler
was
a
traitor
,
and
that
he
would
be
their
leader
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
so
taken
by
surprise
,
that
they
set
up
a
great
shouting
,
and
followed
the
boy
until
he
was
met
at
Islington
by
a
large
body
of
soldiers
.
  
<EOS>
The
end
of
this
rising
was
the
then
usual
end
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
King
found
himself
safe
,
he
unsaid
all
he
had
said
,
and
undid
all
he
had
done
;
some
fifteen
hundred
of
the
rioters
were
tried
(
mostly
in
Essex
)
with
great
rigour
,
and
executed
with
great
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
them
were
hanged
on
gibbets
,
and
left
there
as
a
terror
to
the
country
people
;
and
,
because
their
miserable
friends
took
some
of
the
bodies
down
to
bury
,
the
King
ordered
the
rest
to
be
chained
up
---
which
was
the
beginning
of
the
barbarous
custom
of
hanging
in
chains
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
falsehood
in
this
business
makes
such
a
pitiful
figure
,
that
I
think
Wat
Tyler
appears
in
history
as
beyond
comparison
the
truer
and
more
respectable
man
of
the
two
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
was
now
sixteen
years
of
age
,
and
married
Anne
of
Bohemia
,
an
excellent
princess
,
who
was
called
"
the
good
Queen
Anne
.
"
 
<EOS>
She
deserved
a
better
husband
;
for
the
King
had
been
fawned
and
flattered
into
a
treacherous
,
wasteful
,
dissolute
,
bad
young
man
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
two
Popes
at
this
time
(
as
if
one
were
not
enough
!
)
,
and
their
quarrels
involved
Europe
in
a
great
deal
of
trouble
.
<EOS>
Scotland
was
still
troublesome
too
;
and
at
home
there
was
much
jealousy
and
distrust
,
and
plotting
and
counter
-
plotting
,
because
the
King
feared
the
ambition
of
his
relations
,
and
particularly
of
his
uncle
,
the
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
and
the
duke
had
his
party
against
the
King
,
and
the
King
had
his
party
against
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
home
troubles
lessened
when
the
duke
went
to
Castile
to
urge
his
claim
to
the
crown
of
that
kingdom
;
for
then
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
another
of
Richard
's
uncles
,
opposed
him
,
and
influenced
the
Parliament
to
demand
the
dismissal
of
the
King
's
favourite
ministers
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
said
in
reply
,
that
he
would
not
for
such
men
dismiss
the
meanest
servant
in
his
kitchen
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
had
begun
to
signify
little
what
a
King
said
when
a
Parliament
was
determined
;
so
Richard
was
at
last
obliged
to
give
way
,
and
to
agree
to
another
Government
of
the
kingdom
,
under
a
commission
of
fourteen
nobles
,
for
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
His
uncle
of
Gloucester
was
at
the
head
of
this
commission
,
and
,
in
fact
,
appointed
everybody
composing
it
.
  
<EOS>
Having
done
all
this
,
the
King
declared
as
soon
as
he
saw
an
opportunity
that
he
had
never
meant
to
do
it
,
and
that
it
was
all
illegal
;
and
he
got
the
judges
secretly
to
sign
a
declaration
to
that
effect
.
 
<EOS>
The
secret
oozed
out
directly
,
and
was
carried
to
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
at
the
head
of
forty
thousand
men
,
met
the
King
on
his
entering
into
London
to
enforce
his
authority
;
the
King
was
helpless
against
him
;
his
favourites
and
ministers
were
impeached
and
were
mercilessly
executed
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
were
two
men
whom
the
people
regarded
with
very
different
feelings
;
one
,
Robert
Tresilian
,
Chief
Justice
,
who
was
hated
for
having
made
what
was
called
"
the
bloody
circuit
"
to
try
the
rioters
;
the
other
,
Sir
Simon
Burley
,
an
honourable
knight
,
who
had
been
the
dear
friend
of
the
Black
Prince
,
and
the
governor
and
guardian
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
gentleman
's
life
the
good
Queen
even
begged
of
Gloucester
on
her
knees
;
but
Gloucester
(
with
or
without
reason
)
feared
and
hated
him
,
and
replied
,
that
if
she
valued
her
husband
's
crown
,
she
had
better
beg
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
done
under
what
was
called
by
some
the
wonderful
---
and
by
others
,
with
better
reason
,
the
merciless
---
Parliament
.
  
<EOS>
But
Gloucester
's
power
was
not
to
last
for
ever
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
it
for
only
a
year
longer
;
in
which
year
the
famous
battle
of
Otterbourne
,
sung
in
the
old
ballad
of
Chevy
Chase
,
was
fought
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
year
was
out
,
the
King
,
turning
suddenly
to
Gloucester
,
in
the
midst
of
a
great
council
said
,
"
Uncle
,
how
old
am
I
?
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
highness
,
"
returned
the
Duke
,
"
is
in
your
twenty
-
second
year
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Am
I
so
much
?
"
said
the
King
;
"
then
I
will
manage
my
own
affairs
!
 
<EOS>
I
am
much
obliged
to
you
,
my
good
lords
,
for
your
past
services
,
but
I
need
them
no
more
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
followed
this
up
,
by
appointing
a
new
Chancellor
and
a
new
Treasurer
,
and
announced
to
the
people
that
he
had
resumed
the
Government
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
it
for
eight
years
without
opposition
.
 
<EOS>
Through
all
that
time
,
he
kept
his
determination
to
revenge
himself
some
day
upon
his
uncle
Gloucester
,
in
his
own
breast
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
the
good
Queen
died
,
and
then
the
King
,
desiring
to
take
a
second
wife
,
proposed
to
his
council
that
he
should
marry
Isabella
,
of
France
,
the
daughter
of
Charles
the
Sixth
:
 
<EOS>
who
,
the
French
courtiers
said
(
as
the
English
courtiers
had
said
of
Richard
)
,
was
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
wit
,
and
quite
a
phenomenon
---
of
seven
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
The
council
were
divided
about
this
marriage
,
but
it
took
place
.
 
<EOS>
It
secured
peace
between
England
and
France
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
;
but
it
was
strongly
opposed
to
the
prejudices
of
the
English
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
who
was
anxious
to
take
the
occasion
of
making
himself
popular
,
declaimed
against
it
loudly
,
and
this
at
length
decided
the
King
to
execute
the
vengeance
he
had
been
nursing
so
long
.
  
<EOS>
He
went
with
a
gay
company
to
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
's
house
,
Pleshey
Castle
,
in
Essex
,
where
the
Duke
,
suspecting
nothing
,
came
out
into
the
court
-
yard
to
receive
his
royal
visitor
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
King
conversed
in
a
friendly
manner
with
the
Duchess
,
the
Duke
was
quietly
seized
,
hurried
away
,
shipped
for
Calais
,
and
lodged
in
the
castle
there
.
 
<EOS>
His
friends
,
the
Earls
of
Arundel
and
Warwick
,
were
taken
in
the
same
treacherous
manner
,
and
confined
to
their
castles
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
,
at
Nottingham
,
they
were
impeached
of
high
treason
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Arundel
was
condemned
and
beheaded
,
and
the
Earl
of
Warwick
was
banished
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
writ
was
sent
by
a
messenger
to
the
Governor
of
Calais
,
requiring
him
to
send
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
over
to
be
tried
.
 
<EOS>
In
three
days
he
returned
an
answer
that
he
could
not
do
that
,
because
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
had
died
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
was
declared
a
traitor
,
his
property
was
confiscated
to
the
King
,
a
real
or
pretended
confession
he
had
made
in
prison
to
one
of
the
Justices
of
the
Common
Pleas
was
produced
against
him
,
and
there
was
an
end
of
the
matter
.
 
<EOS>
How
the
unfortunate
duke
died
,
very
few
cared
to
know
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
really
died
naturally
;
whether
he
killed
himself
;
whether
,
by
the
King
's
order
,
he
was
strangled
,
or
smothered
between
two
beds
(
as
a
serving
-
man
of
the
Governor
's
named
Hall
,
did
afterwards
declare
)
,
can
not
be
discovered
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
not
much
doubt
that
he
was
killed
,
somehow
or
other
,
by
his
nephew
's
orders
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
most
active
nobles
in
these
proceedings
were
the
King
's
cousin
,
Henry
Bolingbroke
,
whom
the
King
had
made
Duke
of
Hereford
to
smooth
down
the
old
family
quarrels
,
and
some
others
:
 
who
had
in
the
family
-
plotting
times
done
<EOS>
just
such
acts
themselves
as
they
now
condemned
in
the
duke
.
 
<EOS>
They
seem
to
have
been
a
corrupt
set
of
men
;
but
such
men
were
easily
found
about
the
court
in
such
days
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
murmured
at
all
this
,
and
were
still
very
sore
about
the
French
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
The
nobles
saw
how
little
the
King
cared
for
law
,
and
how
crafty
he
was
,
and
began
to
be
somewhat
afraid
for
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
life
was
a
life
of
continued
feasting
and
excess
;
his
retinue
,
down
to
the
meanest
servants
,
were
dressed
in
the
most
costly
manner
,
and
caroused
at
his
tables
,
it
is
related
,
to
the
number
of
ten
thousand
persons
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
,
surrounded
by
a
body
of
ten
thousand
archers
,
and
enriched
by
a
duty
on
wool
which
the
Commons
had
granted
him
for
life
,
saw
no
danger
of
ever
being
otherwise
than
powerful
and
absolute
,
and
was
as
fierce
and
haughty
as
a
King
could
be
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
two
of
his
old
enemies
left
,
in
the
persons
of
the
Dukes
of
Hereford
and
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
Sparing
these
no
more
than
the
others
,
he
tampered
with
the
Duke
of
Hereford
until
he
got
him
to
declare
before
the
Council
that
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
had
lately
held
some
treasonable
talk
with
him
,
as
he
was
riding
near
Brentford
;
and
that
he
had
told
him
,
among
other
things
,
that
he
could
not
believe
the
King
's
oath
---
which
nobody
could
,
I
should
think
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
treachery
he
obtained
a
pardon
,
and
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
was
summoned
to
appear
and
defend
himself
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
denied
the
charge
and
said
his
accuser
was
a
liar
and
a
traitor
,
both
noblemen
,
according
to
the
manner
of
those
times
,
were
held
in
custody
,
and
the
truth
was
ordered
to
be
decided
by
wager
of
battle
at
Coventry
.
 
<EOS>
This
wager
of
battle
meant
that
whosoever
won
the
combat
was
to
be
considered
in
the
right
;
which
nonsense
meant
in
effect
,
that
no
strong
man
could
ever
be
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
A
great
holiday
was
made
;
a
great
crowd
assembled
,
with
much
parade
and
show
;
and
the
two
combatants
were
about
to
rush
at
each
other
with
their
lances
,
when
the
King
,
sitting
in
a
pavilion
to
see
fair
,
threw
down
the
truncheon
he
carried
in
his
hand
,
and
forbade
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Hereford
was
to
be
banished
for
ten
years
,
and
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
was
to
be
banished
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
So
said
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Hereford
went
to
France
,
and
went
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Norfolk
made
a
pilgrimage
to
the
Holy
Land
,
and
afterwards
died
at
Venice
of
a
broken
heart
.
  
<EOS>
Faster
and
fiercer
,
after
this
,
the
King
went
on
in
his
career
.
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Lancaster
,
who
was
the
father
of
the
Duke
of
Hereford
,
died
soon
after
the
departure
of
his
son
;
and
,
the
King
,
although
he
had
solemnly
granted
to
that
son
leave
to
inherit
his
father
's
property
,
if
it
should
come
to
him
during
his
banishment
,
immediately
seized
it
all
,
like
a
robber
.
 
<EOS>
The
judges
were
so
afraid
of
him
,
that
they
disgraced
themselves
by
declaring
this
theft
to
be
just
and
lawful
.
 
<EOS>
His
avarice
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
He
outlawed
seventeen
counties
at
once
,
on
a
frivolous
pretence
,
merely
to
raise
money
by
way
of
fines
for
misconduct
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
did
as
many
dishonest
things
as
he
could
;
and
cared
so
little
for
the
discontent
of
his
subjects
---
though
even
the
spaniel
favourites
began
to
whisper
to
him
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
discontent
afloat
---
that
he
took
that
time
,
of
all
others
,
for
leaving
England
and
making
an
expedition
against
the
Irish
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
scarcely
gone
,
leaving
the
DUKE
OF
YORK
Regent
in
his
absence
,
when
his
cousin
,
Henry
of
Hereford
,
came
over
from
France
to
claim
the
rights
of
which
he
had
been
so
monstrously
deprived
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
joined
by
the
two
great
Earls
of
Northumberland
and
Westmoreland
;
and
his
uncle
,
the
Regent
,
finding
the
King
's
cause
unpopular
,
and
the
disinclination
of
the
army
to
act
against
Henry
,
very
strong
,
withdrew
with
the
Royal
forces
towards
Bristol
.
<EOS>
Henry
,
at
the
head
of
an
army
,
came
from
Yorkshire
(
where
he
had
landed
)
to
London
and
followed
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
joined
their
forces
---
how
they
brought
that
about
,
is
not
distinctly
understood
---
and
proceeded
to
Bristol
Castle
,
whither
three
noblemen
had
taken
the
young
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
The
castle
surrendering
,
they
presently
put
those
three
noblemen
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
Regent
then
remained
there
,
and
Henry
went
on
to
Chester
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
boisterous
weather
had
prevented
the
King
from
receiving
intelligence
of
what
had
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
it
was
conveyed
to
him
in
Ireland
,
and
he
sent
over
the
EARL
OF
SALISBURY
,
who
,
landing
at
Conway
,
rallied
the
Welshmen
,
and
waited
for
the
King
a
whole
fortnight
;
at
the
end
of
that
time
the
Welshmen
,
who
were
perhaps
not
very
warm
for
him
in
the
beginning
,
quite
cooled
down
and
went
home
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
did
land
on
the
coast
at
last
,
he
came
with
a
pretty
good
power
,
but
his
men
cared
nothing
for
him
,
and
quickly
deserted
.
 
<EOS>
Supposing
the
Welshmen
to
be
still
at
Conway
,
he
disguised
himself
as
a
priest
,
and
made
for
that
place
in
company
with
his
two
brothers
and
some
few
of
their
adherents
.
<EOS>
But
,
there
were
no
Welshmen
left
---
only
Salisbury
and
a
hundred
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
distress
,
the
King
's
two
brothers
,
Exeter
and
Surrey
,
offered
to
go
to
Henry
to
learn
what
his
intentions
were
.
<EOS>
Surrey
,
who
was
true
to
Richard
,
was
put
into
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Exeter
,
who
was
false
,
took
the
royal
badge
,
which
was
a
hart
,
off
his
shield
,
and
assumed
the
rose
,
the
badge
of
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
,
it
was
pretty
plain
to
the
King
<EOS>
what
Henry
's
intentions
were
,
without
sending
any
more
messengers
to
ask
.
  
<EOS>
The
fallen
King
,
thus
deserted
---
<EOS>
hemmed
in
on
all
sides
,
and
pressed
with
hunger
---
rode
here
and
rode
there
,
and
went
to
this
castle
,
and
went
to
that
castle
,
endeavouring
to
obtain
some
provisions
,
but
could
find
none
.
 
<EOS>
He
rode
wretchedly
back
to
Conway
,
and
there
surrendered
himself
to
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
who
came
from
Henry
,
in
reality
to
take
him
prisoner
,
but
in
appearance
to
offer
terms
;
and
whose
men
were
hidden
not
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
By
this
earl
he
was
conducted
to
the
castle
of
Flint
,
where
his
cousin
Henry
met
him
,
and
dropped
on
his
knee
as
if
he
were
still
respectful
to
his
sovereign
.
  
<EOS>
"
Fair
cousin
of
Lancaster
,
"
said
the
King
,
"
you
are
very
welcome
"
<EOS>
(
very
welcome
,
no
doubt
;
but
he
would
have
been
more
so
,
in
chains
or
without
a
head
)
.
  
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
replied
Henry
,
"
I
am
come
a
little
before
my
time
;
but
,
with
your
good
pleasure
,
I
will
show
you
the
reason
.
 
<EOS>
Your
people
complain
with
some
bitterness
,
that
you
have
ruled
them
rigorously
for
two
-
and
-
twenty
years
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
if
it
please
God
,
I
will
help
you
to
govern
them
better
in
future
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
Fair
cousin
,
"
replied
the
abject
King
,
"
since
it
pleaseth
you
,
it
pleaseth
me
mightily
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
the
trumpets
sounded
,
and
the
King
was
stuck
on
a
wretched
horse
,
and
carried
prisoner
to
Chester
,
where
he
was
made
to
issue
a
proclamation
,
calling
a
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
From
Chester
he
was
taken
on
towards
London
.
 
<EOS>
At
Lichfield
he
tried
to
escape
by
getting
out
of
a
window
and
letting
himself
down
into
a
garden
;
it
was
all
in
vain
,
however
,
and
he
was
carried
on
and
shut
up
in
the
Tower
,
where
no
one
pitied
him
,
and
where
the
whole
people
,
whose
patience
he
had
quite
tired
out
,
reproached
him
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
Before
he
got
there
,
it
is
related
,
that
his
very
dog
left
him
and
departed
from
his
side
to
lick
the
hand
of
Henry
.
  
<EOS>
The
day
before
the
Parliament
met
,
a
deputation
went
to
this
wrecked
King
,
and
told
him
that
he
had
promised
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
at
Conway
Castle
to
resign
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
quite
ready
to
do
it
,
and
signed
a
paper
in
which
he
renounced
his
authority
and
absolved
his
people
from
their
allegiance
to
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
so
little
spirit
left
that
he
gave
his
royal
ring
to
his
triumphant
cousin
Henry
with
his
own
hand
,
and
said
,
that
if
he
could
have
had
leave
to
appoint
a
successor
,
that
same
Henry
was
the
man
of
all
others
whom
he
would
have
named
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
Parliament
assembled
in
Westminster
Hall
,
where
Henry
sat
at
the
side
of
the
throne
,
which
was
empty
and
covered
with
a
cloth
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
The
paper
just
signed
by
the
King
was
read
to
the
multitude
amid
shouts
of
joy
,
which
were
echoed
through
all
the
streets
;
when
some
of
the
noise
had
died
away
,
the
King
was
formally
deposed
.
<EOS>
Then
Henry
arose
,
and
,
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
his
forehead
and
breast
,
challenged
the
realm
of
England
as
his
right
;
the
archbishops
of
Canterbury
and
York
seated
him
on
the
throne
.
  
<EOS>
The
multitude
shouted
again
,
and
the
shouts
re
-
echoed
throughout
all
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
remembered
,
now
,
that
Richard
the
Second
had
ever
been
the
most
beautiful
,
the
wisest
,
and
the
best
of
princes
;
and
he
now
made
living
(
to
my
thinking
)
a
far
more
sorry
spectacle
in
the
Tower
of
London
,
than
Wat
Tyler
had
made
,
lying
dead
,
among
the
hoofs
of
the
royal
horses
in
Smithfield
.
  
<EOS>
The
Poll
-
tax
died
with
Wat
.
 
<EOS>
The
Smiths
to
the
King
and
Royal
Family
,
could
make
no
chains
in
which
the
King
could
hang
the
people
's
recollection
of
him
;
so
the
Poll
-
tax
was
never
collected
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Fourth
<EOS>
,
Called
Bolingbroke
    
DURING
the
last
reign
,
the
preaching
of
Wickliffe
against
the
pride
and
cunning
of
the
Pope
and
all
his
men
,
had
made
a
great
noise
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
new
King
wished
to
be
in
favour
with
the
priests
,
or
whether
he
hoped
,
by
pretending
to
be
very
religious
,
to
cheat
Heaven
itself
into
the
belief
that
he
was
not
a
usurper
,
I
do
n't
know
.
 
<EOS>
Both
suppositions
are
likely
enough
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
he
began
his
reign
by
making
a
strong
show
against
the
followers
of
Wickliffe
,
who
were
called
Lollards
,
or
heretics
---
although
his
father
,
John
of
Gaunt
,
had
been
of
that
way
of
thinking
,
as
he
himself
had
been
more
than
suspected
of
being
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
less
certain
that
he
first
established
in
England
the
detestable
and
atrocious
custom
,
brought
from
abroad
,
of
burning
those
people
as
a
punishment
for
their
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
importation
into
England
of
one
of
the
practices
of
what
was
called
the
Holy
Inquisition
:
 
<EOS>
which
was
the
most
UNholy
and
the
most
infamous
tribunal
that
ever
disgraced
mankind
,
and
made
men
more
like
demons
than
followers
of
Our
Saviour
.
  
<EOS>
No
real
right
to
the
crown
,
as
you
know
,
was
in
this
King
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
Mortimer
,
the
young
Earl
of
March
---
who
was
only
eight
or
nine
years
old
,
and
who
was
descended
from
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
the
elder
brother
of
Henry
's
father
---
was
,
by
succession
,
the
real
heir
to
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
King
got
his
son
declared
Prince
of
Wales
;
and
,
obtaining
possession
of
the
young
Earl
of
March
and
his
little
brother
,
kept
them
in
confinement
(
but
not
severely
)
in
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
required
the
Parliament
to
decide
what
was
to
be
done
with
the
deposed
King
,
who
was
quiet
enough
,
and
who
only
said
that
he
hoped
his
cousin
Henry
would
be
"
a
good
lord
"
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
replied
that
they
would
recommend
his
being
kept
in
some
secret
place
where
the
people
could
not
resort
,
and
where
his
friends
could
not
be
admitted
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
accordingly
passed
this
sentence
upon
him
,
and
it
now
began
to
be
pretty
clear
to
the
nation
that
Richard
the
Second
would
not
live
very
long
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
a
noisy
Parliament
,
as
it
was
an
unprincipled
one
,
and
the
Lords
quarrelled
so
violently
among
themselves
as
to
which
of
them
had
been
loyal
and
which
disloyal
,
and
which
consistent
and
which
inconsistent
,
<EOS>
that
forty
gauntlets
are
said
to
have
been
thrown
upon
the
floor
at
one
time
as
challenges
to
as
many
battles
:
 
the
truth
being
that
they
were
all
false
and
base
together
,
and
had
been
,
at
one
time
with
the
old
King
,
and
at
another
time
with
the
new
one
,
and
seldom
true
for
any
length
of
time
to
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
They
soon
began
to
plot
again
.
 
<EOS>
A
conspiracy
was
formed
to
invite
the
King
to
a
tournament
at
Oxford
,
and
then
to
take
him
by
surprise
and
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
murderous
enterprise
,
which
was
agreed
upon
at
secret
meetings
in
the
house
of
the
Abbot
of
Westminster
,
was
betrayed
by
the
Earl
of
Rutland
---
one
of
the
conspirators
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
instead
of
going
to
the
tournament
or
staying
at
Windsor
(
where
the
conspirators
suddenly
went
,
on
finding
themselves
discovered
,
with
the
hope
of
seizing
him
)
,
retired
to
London
,
proclaimed
them
all
traitors
,
and
advanced
upon
them
with
a
great
force
.
 
<EOS>
They
retired
into
the
west
of
England
,
proclaiming
Richard
King
;
but
,
the
people
rose
against
them
,
and
they
were
all
slain
.
<EOS>
Their
treason
hastened
the
death
of
the
deposed
monarch
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
killed
by
hired
assassins
,
or
whether
he
was
starved
to
death
,
or
whether
he
refused
food
on
hearing
of
his
brothers
being
killed
(
who
were
in
that
plot
)
,
is
very
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
He
met
his
death
somehow
;
and
his
body
was
publicly
shown
at
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
with
only
the
lower
part
of
the
face
uncovered
.
 
<EOS>
I
can
scarcely
doubt
that
he
was
killed
by
the
King
's
orders
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
wife
of
the
miserable
Richard
was
now
only
ten
years
old
;
and
,
when
her
father
,
Charles
of
France
,
heard
of
her
misfortunes
and
of
her
lonely
condition
in
England
,
he
went
mad
:
as
he
had
several
times
done
before
,
during
the
last
five
or
six
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
Dukes
of
Burgundy
and
Bourbon
took
up
the
poor
girl
's
cause
,
without
caring
much
about
it
,
but
on
the
chance
of
getting
something
out
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
of
Bordeaux
,
who
had
a
sort
of
superstitious
attachment
to
the
memory
of
Richard
,
because
he
was
born
there
,
swore
by
the
Lord
that
he
had
been
the
best
man
in
all
his
kingdom
---
which
was
going
rather
far
---
and
promised
to
do
great
things
against
the
English
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
they
came
to
consider
that
they
,
and
the
whole
people
of
France
,
were
ruined
by
their
own
nobles
,
and
that
the
English
rule
was
much
the
better
of
the
two
,
they
cooled
down
again
;
and
the
two
dukes
,
although
they
were
very
great
men
,
could
do
nothing
without
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
began
negotiations
between
France
and
England
for
the
sending
home
to
Paris
of
the
poor
little
Queen
with
all
her
jewels
and
her
fortune
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
in
gold
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
quite
willing
to
restore
the
young
lady
,
and
even
the
jewels
;
but
he
said
he
really
could
not
part
with
the
money
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
at
last
she
was
safely
deposited
at
Paris
without
her
fortune
,
and
then
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
(
who
was
cousin
to
the
French
King
)
began
to
quarrel
with
the
Duke
of
Orleans
(
who
was
brother
to
the
French
King
)
about
the
whole
matter
;
and
those
two
dukes
made
France
even
more
wretched
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
idea
of
conquering
Scotland
was
still
popular
at
home
,
the
King
marched
to
the
river
Tyne
and
demanded
homage
of
the
King
of
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
This
being
refused
,
he
advanced
to
Edinburgh
,
but
did
little
there
;
for
,
his
army
being
in
want
of
provisions
,
and
the
Scotch
being
very
careful
to
hold
him
in
check
without
giving
battle
,
he
was
obliged
to
retire
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
to
his
immortal
honour
that
in
this
sally
he
burnt
no
villages
and
slaughtered
no
people
,
but
was
particularly
careful
that
his
army
should
be
merciful
and
harmless
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
example
in
those
ruthless
times
.
  
<EOS>
A
war
among
the
border
people
of
England
and
Scotland
went
on
for
twelve
months
,
and
then
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
the
nobleman
who
had
helped
Henry
to
the
crown
,
began
to
rebel
against
him
---
probably
because
nothing
that
Henry
could
do
for
him
would
satisfy
his
extravagant
expectations
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
Welsh
gentleman
,
named
OWEN
GLENDOWER
,
who
had
been
a
student
in
one
of
the
Inns
of
Court
,
and
had
afterwards
been
in
the
service
of
the
late
King
,
whose
Welsh
property
was
taken
from
him
by
a
powerful
lord
related
to
the
present
King
,
who
was
his
neighbour
.
 
<EOS>
Appealing
for
redress
,
and
getting
none
,
he
took
up
arms
,
was
made
an
outlaw
,
and
declared
himself
sovereign
of
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretended
to
be
a
magician
;
and
not
only
were
the
Welsh
people
stupid
enough
to
believe
him
,
but
,
even
Henry
believed
him
too
;
for
,
making
three
expeditions
into
Wales
,
and
being
three
times
driven
back
by
the
wildness
of
the
country
,
the
bad
weather
,
and
the
skill
of
Glendower
,
he
thought
he
was
defeated
by
the
Welshman
's
magic
arts
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
took
Lord
Grey
and
Sir
Edmund
Mortimer
,
prisoners
,
and
allowed
the
relatives
of
Lord
Grey
to
ransom
him
,
but
would
not
extend
such
favour
to
Sir
Edmund
Mortimer
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Henry
Percy
,
called
HOTSPUR
,
son
of
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
who
was
married
to
Mortimer
's
sister
,
is
supposed
to
have
taken
offence
at
this
;
and
,
therefore
,
in
conjunction
with
his
father
and
some
others
,
to
have
joined
Owen
Glendower
,
and
risen
against
Henry
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
by
no
means
clear
that
this
was
the
real
cause
of
the
conspiracy
;
but
perhaps
it
was
made
the
pretext
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
formed
,
and
was
very
powerful
;
including
SCROOP
,
Archbishop
of
York
,
and
the
EARL
OF
DOUGLAS
,
a
powerful
and
brave
Scottish
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
prompt
and
active
,
and
the
two
armies
met
at
Shrewsbury
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
about
fourteen
thousand
men
in
each
.
 
<EOS>
The
old
Earl
of
Northumberland
being
sick
<EOS>
,
the
rebel
forces
were
led
by
his
son
.
<EOS>
The
King
wore
plain
armour
to
deceive
the
enemy
;
and
four
noblemen
,
with
the
same
object
,
wore
the
royal
arms
.
 
<EOS>
The
rebel
charge
was
so
furious
,
that
every
one
of
those
gentlemen
was
killed
,
the
royal
standard
was
beaten
down
,
and
the
young
Prince
of
Wales
was
severely
wounded
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
one
of
the
bravest
and
best
soldiers
that
ever
lived
,
and
he
fought
so
well
,
and
the
King
's
troops
were
so
encouraged
by
his
bold
example
,
that
they
rallied
immediately
,
and
cut
the
enemy
's
forces
all
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
Hotspur
was
killed
by
an
arrow
in
the
brain
,
and
the
rout
was
so
complete
that
the
whole
rebellion
was
struck
down
by
this
one
blow
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Northumberland
surrendered
himself
soon
after
hearing
of
the
death
of
his
son
,
and
received
a
pardon
for
all
his
offences
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
some
lingerings
of
rebellion
yet
:
 
<EOS>
Owen
Glendower
being
retired
to
Wales
,
and
a
preposterous
story
being
spread
among
the
ignorant
people
that
King
Richard
was
still
alive
.
 
<EOS>
How
they
could
have
believed
such
nonsense
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
;
but
they
certainly
did
suppose
that
the
Court
fool
of
the
late
King
,
who
was
something
like
him
,
was
he
,
himself
;
so
that
it
seemed
as
if
,
after
giving
so
much
trouble
to
the
country
in
his
life
,
he
was
still
to
trouble
it
after
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
worst
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
Earl
of
March
and
his
brother
were
stolen
out
of
Windsor
Castle
.
<EOS>
Being
retaken
,
and
being
found
to
have
been
spirited
away
by
one
Lady
Spencer
,
she
accused
her
own
brother
,
that
Earl
of
Rutland
who
was
in
the
former
conspiracy
and
was
now
Duke
of
York
,
of
being
in
the
plot
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
he
was
ruined
in
fortune
,
though
not
put
to
death
;
and
then
another
plot
arose
among
the
old
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
some
other
lords
,
and
that
same
Scroop
,
Archbishop
of
York
,
who
was
with
the
rebels
before
.
 
<EOS>
These
conspirators
caused
a
writing
to
be
posted
on
the
church
doors
,
accusing
the
King
of
a
variety
of
crimes
;
but
,
the
King
being
eager
and
vigilant
to
oppose
them
,
they
were
all
taken
,
and
the
Archbishop
was
executed
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
first
time
that
a
great
churchman
had
been
slain
by
the
law
in
England
;
but
the
King
was
resolved
that
it
should
be
done
,
and
done
it
was
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
most
remarkable
event
of
this
time
was
the
seizure
,
by
Henry
,
of
the
heir
to
the
Scottish
throne
---
James
,
a
boy
of
nine
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
put
aboard
-
ship
by
his
father
,
the
Scottish
King
Robert
,
to
save
him
from
the
designs
of
his
uncle
,
when
,
on
his
way
to
France
,
he
was
accidentally
taken
by
some
English
cruisers
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
a
prisoner
in
England
for
nineteen
years
,
and
became
in
his
prison
a
student
and
a
famous
poet
.
  
<EOS>
With
the
exception
of
occasional
troubles
with
the
Welsh
and
with
the
French
,
the
rest
of
King
Henry
's
reign
was
quiet
enough
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
King
was
far
from
happy
,
and
probably
was
troubled
in
his
conscience
by
knowing
that
he
had
usurped
the
crown
,
and
had
occasioned
the
death
of
his
miserable
cousin
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
of
Wales
,
though
brave
and
generous
,
is
said
to
have
been
wild
and
dissipated
,
and
even
to
have
drawn
his
sword
on
GASCOIGNE
,
the
Chief
Justice
of
the
King
's
Bench
,
because
he
was
firm
in
dealing
impartially
with
one
of
his
dissolute
companions
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
the
Chief
Justice
is
said
to
have
ordered
him
immediately
to
prison
;
the
Prince
of
Wales
is
said
to
have
submitted
with
a
good
grace
;
and
the
King
is
said
to
have
exclaimed
,
"
Happy
is
the
monarch
who
has
so
just
a
judge
,
and
a
son
so
willing
to
obey
the
laws
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
is
all
very
doubtful
,
and
so
is
another
story
(
of
which
Shakespeare
has
made
beautiful
use
)
,
that
the
Prince
once
took
the
crown
out
of
his
father
's
chamber
as
he
was
sleeping
,
and
tried
it
on
his
own
head
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
's
health
sank
more
and
more
,
and
he
became
subject
to
violent
eruptions
on
the
face
and
to
bad
epileptic
fits
,
and
his
spirits
sank
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
as
he
was
praying
before
the
shrine
of
St
Edward
at
Westminster
Abbey
,
he
was
seized
with
a
terrible
fit
,
and
was
carried
into
the
Abbot
's
chamber
,
where
he
presently
died
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
been
foretold
that
he
would
die
at
Jerusalem
,
which
certainly
is
not
,
and
never
was
,
Westminster
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
the
Abbot
's
room
had
long
been
called
the
Jerusalem
chamber
,
people
said
it
was
all
the
same
thing
,
and
were
quite
satisfied
with
the
prediction
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
died
on
the
20th
of
March
,
1413
,
in
the
forty
-
seventh
year
of
his
age
,
and
the
fourteenth
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
buried
in
Canterbury
Cathedral
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
twice
married
,
and
had
,
by
his
first
wife
,
a
family
of
four
sons
and
two
daughters
.
 
<EOS>
Considering
his
duplicity
before
he
came
to
the
throne
,
his
unjust
seizure
of
it
,
and
above
all
,
his
making
that
monstrous
law
for
the
burning
of
what
the
priests
called
heretics
,
he
was
a
reasonably
good
king
,
as
kings
went
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Fifth
First
Part
    
<EOS>
THE
Prince
of
Wales
began
his
reign
like
a
generous
and
honest
man
.
<EOS>
He
set
the
young
Earl
of
March
free
;
he
restored
their
estates
and
their
honours
to
the
Percy
family
,
who
had
lost
them
by
their
rebellion
against
his
father
;
he
ordered
the
imbecile
and
unfortunate
Richard
to
be
honourably
buried
among
the
Kings
of
England
;
and
he
dismissed
all
his
wild
companions
,
with
assurances
that
they
should
not
want
,
if
they
would
resolve
to
be
steady
,
faithful
,
and
true
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
much
easier
to
burn
men
than
to
burn
their
opinions
;
and
those
of
the
Lollards
were
spreading
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lollards
were
represented
by
the
priests
---
probably
falsely
for
the
most
part
---
to
entertain
treasonable
designs
against
the
new
King
;
and
Henry
,
suffering
himself
to
be
worked
upon
by
these
representations
,
sacrificed
his
friend
Sir
John
Oldcastle
,
the
Lord
Cobham
,
to
them
,
after
trying
in
vain
to
convert
him
by
arguments
.

He
was
declared
guilty
,
as
the
head
of
the
sect
,
and
sentenced
to
the
flames
;
but
he
escaped
from
the
Tower
before
the
day
of
execution
(
postponed
for
fifty
days
by
the
King
himself
)
,
and
summoned
the
Lollards
to
meet
him
near
London
on
a
certain
day
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
priests
told
the
King
,
at
least
.
 
<EOS>
I
doubt
whether
there
was
any
conspiracy
beyond
such
as
was
got
up
by
their
agents
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
appointed
,
instead
of
five
-
and
-
twenty
thousand
men
,
under
the
command
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
,
in
the
meadows
of
St
Giles
,
the
King
found
only
eighty
men
,
and
no
Sir
John
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
,
in
another
place
,
an
addle
-
headed
brewer
,
who
had
gold
trappings
to
his
horses
,
and
a
pair
of
gilt
spurs
in
his
breast
---
expecting
to
be
made
a
knight
next
day
by
Sir
John
,
and
so
to
gain
the
right
to
wear
them
---
but
there
was
no
Sir
John
,
nor
did
anybody
give
information
respecting
him
,
though
the
King
offered
great
rewards
for
such
intelligence
.
<EOS>
Thirty
of
these
unfortunate
Lollards
were
hanged
and
drawn
immediately
,
and
were
then
burnt
,
gallows
and
all
;
and
the
various
prisons
in
and
around
London
were
crammed
full
of
others
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
these
unfortunate
men
made
various
confessions
of
treasonable
designs
;
but
,
such
confessions
were
easily
got
,
under
torture
and
the
fear
of
fire
,
and
are
very
little
to
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
To
finish
the
sad
story
of
Sir
John
Oldcastle
at
once
,
I
may
mention
that
he
escaped
into
Wales
,
and
remained
there
safely
,
for
four
years
.
<EOS>
When
discovered
by
Lord
Powis
,
it
is
very
doubtful
if
he
would
have
been
taken
alive
---
so
great
was
the
old
soldier
's
bravery
---
if
a
miserable
old
woman
had
not
come
behind
him
and
broken
his
legs
with
a
stool
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
carried
to
London
in
a
horse
-
litter
,
was
fastened
by
an
iron
chain
to
a
gibbet
,
and
so
roasted
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
To
make
the
state
of
France
as
plain
as
I
can
in
a
few
words
,
I
should
tell
you
that
the
Duke
of
Orleans
,
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
commonly
called
"
John
without
fear
,
"
had
had
a
grand
reconciliation
of
their
quarrel
in
the
last
reign
,
and
had
appeared
to
be
quite
in
a
heavenly
state
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
Immediately
after
which
,
on
a
Sunday
,
in
the
public
streets
of
Paris
,
the
Duke
of
Orleans
was
murdered
by
a
party
of
twenty
men
,
set
on
by
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
---
according
to
his
own
deliberate
confession
.
 
<EOS>
The
widow
of
King
Richard
had
been
married
in
France
to
the
eldest
son
of
the
Duke
of
Orleans
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
mad
King
was
quite
powerless
to
help
her
,
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
became
the
real
master
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
Isabella
dying
,
her
husband
(
Duke
of
Orleans
since
the
death
of
his
father
)
married
the
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Armagnac
,
who
,
being
a
much
abler
man
than
his
young
son
-
in
-
law
,
headed
his
party
;
thence
called
after
him
Armagnacs
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
France
was
now
in
this
terrible
condition
,
that
it
had
in
it
the
party
of
the
King
's
son
,
the
Dauphin
Louis
;
the
party
of
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
who
was
the
father
of
the
Dauphin
's
ill
-
used
wife
;
and
the
party
of
the
Armagnacs
;
all
hating
each
other
;
all
fighting
together
;
all
composed
of
the
most
depraved
nobles
that
the
earth
has
ever
known
;
and
all
tearing
unhappy
France
to
pieces
.
  
<EOS>
The
late
King
had
watched
these
dissensions
from
England
,
sensible
(
like
the
French
people
)
that
no
enemy
of
France
could
injure
her
more
than
her
own
nobility
.
 
<EOS>
The
present
King
now
advanced
a
claim
to
the
French
throne
.
 
<EOS>
His
demand
being
,
of
course
,
refused
,
he
reduced
his
proposal
to
a
certain
large
amount
of
French
territory
,
and
to
demanding
the
French
princess
,
Catherine
,
in
marriage
,
with
a
fortune
of
two
millions
of
golden
crowns
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
offered
less
territory
and
fewer
crowns
,
and
no
princess
;
but
he
called
his
ambassadors
home
and
prepared
for
war
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
proposed
to
take
the
princess
with
one
million
of
crowns
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
Court
replied
that
he
should
have
the
princess
with
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
less
;
he
said
this
would
not
do
(
he
had
never
seen
the
princess
in
his
life
)
,
and
assembled
his
army
at
Southampton
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
short
plot
at
home
just
at
that
time
,
for
deposing
him
,
and
making
the
Earl
of
March
king
;
but
the
conspirators
were
all
speedily
condemned
and
executed
,
and
the
King
embarked
for
France
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
dreadful
to
observe
how
long
a
bad
example
will
be
followed
;
but
,
it
is
encouraging
to
know
that
a
good
example
is
never
thrown
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
first
act
on
disembarking
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
Seine
,
three
miles
from
Harfleur
,
was
to
imitate
his
father
,
and
to
proclaim
his
solemn
orders
that
the
lives
and
property
of
the
peaceable
inhabitants
should
be
respected
on
pain
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
agreed
by
French
writers
,
to
his
lasting
renown
,
that
even
while
his
soldiers
were
suffering
the
greatest
distress
from
want
of
food
,
these
commands
were
rigidly
obeyed
.
  
<EOS>
With
an
army
in
all
of
thirty
thousand
men
,
he
besieged
the
town
of
Harfleur
both
by
sea
and
land
for
five
weeks
;
at
the
end
of
which
time
the
town
surrendered
,
and
the
inhabitants
were
allowed
to
depart
with
only
fivepence
each
,
and
a
part
of
their
clothes
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
rest
of
their
possessions
was
divided
amongst
the
English
army
.
<EOS>
But
,
that
army
suffered
so
much
,
in
spite
of
its
successes
,
from
disease
and
privation
,
that
it
was
already
reduced
one
half
.
<EOS>
Still
,
the
King
was
determined
not
to
retire
until
he
had
struck
a
greater
blow
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
against
the
advice
of
all
his
counsellors
,
he
moved
on
with
his
little
force
towards
Calais
.
<EOS>
When
he
came
up
to
the
river
Somme
he
was
unable
to
cross
,
in
consequence
of
the
fort
being
fortified
;
and
,
as
the
English
moved
up
the
left
bank
of
the
river
looking
for
a
crossing
,
the
French
,
who
had
broken
all
the
bridges
,
moved
up
the
right
bank
,
watching
them
,
and
waiting
to
attack
them
when
they
should
try
to
pass
it
.
<EOS>
At
last
the
English
found
a
crossing
and
got
safely
over
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
held
a
council
of
war
at
Rouen
,
resolved
to
give
the
English
battle
,
and
sent
heralds
to
King
Henry
to
know
by
which
road
he
was
going
.
 
<EOS>
"
By
the
road
that
will
take
me
straight
to
Calais
!
"
said
the
King
,
and
sent
them
away
with
a
present
of
a
hundred
crowns
.
  
<EOS>
The
English
moved
on
,
until
they
beheld
the
French
,
and
then
the
King
gave
orders
to
form
in
line
of
battle
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
not
coming
on
,
the
army
broke
up
after
remaining
in
battle
array
till
night
,
and
got
good
rest
and
refreshment
at
a
neighbouring
village
.
 
<EOS>
The
French
were
now
all
lying
in
another
village
,
through
which
they
knew
the
English
must
pass
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
resolved
that
the
English
should
begin
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
had
no
means
of
retreat
,
if
their
King
had
any
such
intention
;
and
so
the
two
armies
passed
the
night
,
close
together
.
  
<EOS>
To
understand
these
armies
well
,
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
immense
French
army
had
,
among
its
notable
persons
,
almost
the
whole
of
that
wicked
nobility
,
whose
debauchery
had
made
France
a
desert
;
and
so
besotted
were
they
by
pride
,
and
by
contempt
for
the
common
people
,
that
they
had
scarcely
any
bowmen
(
if
indeed
they
had
any
at
all
)
in
their
whole
enormous
number
:
 
which
,
compared
with
the
English
army
,
was
at
least
as
six
to
one
.
 
<EOS>
For
these
proud
fools
had
said
that
the
bow
was
not
a
fit
weapon
for
knightly
hands
,
and
that
France
must
be
defended
by
gentlemen
only
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
presently
,
what
hand
the
gentlemen
made
of
it
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
on
the
English
side
,
among
the
little
force
,
there
was
a
good
proportion
of
men
who
were
not
gentlemen
by
any
means
,
but
who
were
good
stout
archers
for
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
,
in
the
morning
---
having
slept
little
at
night
,
while
the
French
were
carousing
and
making
sure
of
victory
---
the
King
rode
,
on
a
grey
horse
;
wearing
on
his
head
a
helmet
of
shining
steel
,
surmounted
by
a
crown
of
gold
,
sparkling
with
precious
stones
;
and
bearing
over
his
armour
,
embroidered
together
,
the
arms
of
England
and
the
arms
of
France
.
<EOS>
The
archers
looked
at
the
shining
helmet
and
the
crown
of
gold
and
the
sparkling
jewels
,
and
admired
them
all
;
but
,
what
they
admired
most
was
the
King
's
cheerful
face
,
and
his
bright
blue
eye
,
as
he
told
them
that
,
for
himself
,
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
conquer
there
or
to
die
there
,
and
that
England
should
never
have
a
ransom
to
pay
for
HIM
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
brave
knight
who
chanced
to
say
that
he
wished
some
of
the
many
gallant
gentlemen
and
good
soldiers
,
who
were
then
idle
at
home
in
England
,
were
there
to
increase
their
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
told
him
that
,
for
his
part
,
he
did
not
wish
for
one
more
man
.
 
<EOS>
"
The
fewer
we
have
,
"
said
he
,
"
the
greater
will
be
the
honour
we
shall
win
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
men
,
being
now
all
in
good
heart
,
were
refreshed
with
bread
and
wine
,
and
heard
prayers
,
and
waited
quietly
for
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
waited
for
the
French
,
because
they
were
drawn
up
thirty
deep
<EOS>
(
the
little
English
force
was
only
three
deep
)
,
on
very
difficult
and
heavy
ground
;
and
he
knew
that
when
they
moved
,
there
must
be
confusion
among
them
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
did
not
move
,
he
sent
off
two
parties
:
---
one
to
lie
concealed
in
a
wood
on
the
left
of
the
French
:
 
the
other
,
to
set
fire
to
some
houses
behind
the
French
after
the
battle
should
be
begun
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
scarcely
done
,
when
three
of
the
proud
French
gentlemen
,
who
were
to
defend
their
country
without
any
help
from
the
base
peasants
,
came
riding
out
,
calling
upon
the
English
to
surrender
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
warned
those
gentlemen
himself
to
retire
with
all
speed
if
they
cared
for
their
lives
,
and
ordered
the
English
banners
to
advance
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
Sir
Thomas
Erpingham
,
a
great
English
general
,
who
commanded
the
archers
,
threw
his
truncheon
into
the
air
,
joyfully
,
and
all
the
English
men
,
kneeling
down
upon
the
ground
and
biting
it
as
if
they
took
possession
of
the
country
,
rose
up
with
a
great
shout
and
fell
upon
the
French
.
  
<EOS>
Every
archer
was
furnished
with
a
great
stake
tipped
with
iron
;
and
his
orders
were
,
to
thrust
this
stake
into
the
ground
,
to
discharge
his
arrow
,
and
then
to
fall
back
,
when
the
French
horsemen
came
on
.
<EOS>
As
the
haughty
French
gentlemen
,
who
were
to
break
the
English
archers
and
utterly
destroy
them
with
their
knightly
lances
,
came
riding
up
,
they
were
received
with
such
a
blinding
storm
of
arrows
,
that
they
broke
and
turned
.
 
<EOS>
Horses
and
men
rolled
over
one
another
,
and
the
confusion
was
terrific
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
rallied
and
charged
the
archers
got
among
the
stakes
on
slippery
and
boggy
ground
,
and
were
so
bewildered
that
the
English
archers
---
who
wore
no
armour
,
and
even
took
off
their
leathern
coats
to
be
more
active
---
cut
them
to
pieces
,
root
and
branch
.
 
<EOS>
Only
three
French
horsemen
got
within
the
stakes
,
and
those
were
instantly
despatched
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
the
dense
French
army
,
being
in
armour
,
were
sinking
knee
-
deep
into
the
mire
;
while
the
light
English
archers
,
half
-
naked
,
were
as
fresh
and
active
as
if
they
were
fighting
on
a
marble
floor
.
  
<EOS>
But
now
,
the
second
division
of
the
French
coming
to
the
relief
of
the
first
,
closed
up
in
a
firm
mass
;
the
English
,
headed
by
the
King
,
attacked
them
;
and
the
deadliest
part
of
the
battle
began
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
brother
,
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
was
struck
down
,
and
numbers
of
the
French
surrounded
him
;
but
,
King
Henry
,
standing
over
the
body
,
fought
like
a
lion
until
they
were
beaten
off
.
  
<EOS>
Presently
,
came
up
a
band
of
eighteen
French
knights
,
bearing
the
banner
of
a
certain
French
lord
,
who
had
sworn
to
kill
or
take
the
English
King
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
them
struck
him
such
a
blow
with
a
battle
-
axe
that
he
reeled
and
fell
upon
his
knees
;
but
,
his
faithful
men
,
immediately
closing
round
him
,
killed
every
one
of
those
eighteen
knights
,
and
so
that
French
lord
never
kept
his
oath
.
  
<EOS>
The
French
Duke
of
Alenáon
,
seeing
this
,
made
a
desperate
charge
,
and
cut
his
way
close
up
to
the
Royal
Standard
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
beat
down
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
was
standing
near
it
;
and
,
when
the
King
came
to
his
rescue
,
struck
off
a
piece
of
the
crown
he
wore
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
never
struck
another
blow
in
this
world
;
for
,
even
as
he
was
in
the
act
of
saying
who
he
was
,
and
that
he
surrendered
to
the
King
;
and
even
as
the
King
stretched
out
his
hand
to
give
him
a
safe
and
honourable
acceptance
of
the
offer
;
he
fell
dead
,
pierced
by
innumerable
wounds
.
  
<EOS>
The
death
of
this
nobleman
decided
the
battle
.
 
<EOS>
The
third
division
of
the
French
army
,
which
had
never
struck
a
blow
yet
,
and
which
was
,
in
itself
,
more
than
double
the
whole
English
power
,
broke
and
fled
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
of
the
fight
,
the
English
,
who
as
yet
had
made
no
prisoners
,
began
to
take
them
in
immense
numbers
,
and
were
still
occupied
in
doing
so
,
or
in
killing
those
who
would
not
surrender
,
when
a
great
noise
arose
in
the
rear
of
the
French
---
their
flying
banners
were
seen
to
stop
---
and
King
Henry
,
supposing
a
great
reinforcement
to
have
arrived
,
gave
orders
that
all
the
prisoners
should
be
put
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
,
however
,
as
it
was
found
that
the
noise
was
only
occasioned
by
a
body
of
plundering
peasants
,
the
terrible
massacre
was
stopped
.
  
<EOS>
Then
King
Henry
called
to
him
the
French
herald
,
and
asked
him
to
whom
the
victory
belonged
.
  
<EOS>
The
herald
replied
,
"
To
the
King
of
England
.
<EOS>
"
  
"
WE
have
not
made
this
havoc
and
slaughter
,
"
said
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
the
wrath
of
Heaven
on
the
sins
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
What
is
the
name
of
that
castle
yonder
?
"
  
<EOS>
The
herald
answered
him
,
"
My
lord
,
it
is
the
castle
of
Azincourt
.
"
<EOS>
Said
the
King
,
"
From
henceforth
this
battle
shall
be
known
to
posterity
,
by
the
name
of
the
battle
of
Azincourt
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Our
English
historians
have
made
it
Agincourt
;
but
,
under
that
name
,
it
will
ever
be
famous
in
English
annals
.
  
<EOS>
The
loss
upon
the
French
side
was
enormous
.
 
<EOS>
Three
Dukes
were
killed
,
two
more
were
taken
prisoners
,
seven
Counts
were
killed
,
three
more
were
taken
prisoners
,
and
ten
thousand
knights
and
gentlemen
were
slain
upon
the
field
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
loss
amounted
to
sixteen
hundred
men
,
among
whom
were
the
Duke
of
York
and
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
.
  
<EOS>
War
is
a
dreadful
thing
;
and
it
is
appalling
to
know
how
the
English
were
obliged
,
next
morning
,
to
kill
those
prisoners
mortally
wounded
,
who
yet
writhed
in
agony
upon
the
ground
;
how
the
dead
upon
the
French
side
were
stripped
by
their
own
countrymen
and
countrywomen
,
and
afterwards
buried
in
great
pits
;
how
the
dead
upon
the
English
side
were
piled
up
in
a
great
barn
,
and
how
their
bodies
and
the
barn
were
all
burned
together
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
in
such
things
,
and
in
many
more
much
too
horrible
to
relate
,
that
the
real
desolation
and
wickedness
of
war
consist
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
can
make
war
otherwise
than
horrible
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
dark
side
of
it
was
little
thought
of
and
soon
forgotten
;
and
it
cast
no
shade
of
trouble
on
the
English
people
,
except
on
those
who
had
lost
friends
or
relations
in
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
They
welcomed
their
King
home
with
shouts
of
rejoicing
,
and
plunged
into
the
water
to
bear
him
ashore
on
their
shoulders
,
and
flocked
out
in
crowds
to
welcome
him
in
every
town
through
which
he
passed
,
and
hung
rich
carpets
and
tapestries
out
of
the
windows
,
and
strewed
the
streets
with
flowers
,
and
made
the
fountains
run
with
wine
,
as
the
great
field
of
Agincourt
had
run
with
blood
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
<EOS>
THAT
proud
and
wicked
French
nobility
who
dragged
their
country
to
destruction
,
and
who
were
every
day
and
every
year
regarded
with
deeper
hatred
and
detestation
in
the
hearts
of
the
French
people
,
learnt
nothing
,
even
from
the
defeat
of
Agincourt
.
 
<EOS>
So
far
from
uniting
against
the
common
enemy
,
they
became
,
among
themselves
,
more
violent
,
more
bloody
,
and
more
false
---
if
that
were
possible
---
than
they
had
been
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
Count
of
Armagnac
persuaded
the
French
king
to
plunder
of
her
treasures
Queen
Isabella
of
Bavaria
,
and
to
make
her
a
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
who
had
hitherto
been
the
bitter
enemy
of
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
proposed
to
join
him
,
in
revenge
.
<EOS>
He
carried
her
off
to
Troyes
,
where
she
proclaimed
herself
Regent
of
France
,
and
made
him
her
lieutenant
.
 
<EOS>
The
Armagnac
party
were
at
that
time
possessed
of
Paris
;
but
,
one
of
the
gates
of
the
city
being
secretly
opened
on
a
certain
night
to
a
party
of
the
duke
's
men
,
they
got
into
Paris
,
threw
into
the
prisons
all
the
Armagnacs
upon
whom
they
could
lay
their
hands
,
and
,
a
few
nights
afterwards
,
with
the
aid
of
a
furious
mob
of
sixty
thousand
people
,
broke
the
prisons
open
,
and
killed
them
all
.
 
<EOS>
The
former
Dauphin
was
now
dead
,
and
the
King
's
third
son
bore
the
title
.
 
<EOS>
Him
,
in
the
height
of
this
murderous
scene
,
a
French
knight
hurried
out
of
bed
,
wrapped
in
a
sheet
,
and
bore
away
to
Poitiers
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
when
the
revengeful
Isabella
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
entered
Paris
in
triumph
after
the
slaughter
of
their
enemies
,
the
Dauphin
was
proclaimed
at
Poitiers
as
the
real
Regent
.
  
<EOS>
King
Henry
had
not
been
idle
since
his
victory
of
Agincourt
,
but
had
repulsed
a
brave
attempt
of
the
French
to
recover
Harfleur
;
had
gradually
conquered
a
great
part
of
Normandy
;
and
,
at
this
crisis
of
affairs
,
took
the
important
town
of
Rouen
,
after
a
siege
of
half
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
This
great
loss
so
alarmed
the
French
,
that
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
proposed
that
a
meeting
to
treat
of
peace
should
be
held
between
the
French
and
the
English
kings
in
a
plain
by
the
river
Seine
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
appointed
day
,
King
Henry
appeared
there
,
with
his
two
brothers
,
Clarence
and
Gloucester
,
and
a
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
French
King
,
being
more
mad
than
usual
that
day
,
could
not
come
;
but
the
Queen
came
,
and
with
her
the
Princess
Catherine
:
who
was
a
very
lovely
creature
,
and
who
made
a
real
impression
on
King
Henry
,
now
that
he
saw
her
for
the
first
time
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
most
important
circumstance
that
arose
out
of
the
meeting
.
  
<EOS>
As
if
it
were
impossible
for
a
French
nobleman
of
that
time
to
be
true
to
his
word
of
honour
in
anything
,
Henry
discovered
that
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
was
,
at
that
very
moment
,
in
secret
treaty
with
the
Dauphin
;
and
he
therefore
abandoned
the
negotiation
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Burgundy
and
the
Dauphin
,
each
of
whom
with
the
best
reason
distrusted
the
other
as
a
noble
ruffian
surrounded
by
a
party
of
noble
ruffians
,
were
rather
at
a
loss
how
to
proceed
after
this
;
but
,
at
length
they
agreed
to
meet
,
on
a
bridge
over
the
river
Yonne
,
where
it
was
arranged
that
there
should
be
two
strong
gates
put
up
,
with
an
empty
space
between
them
;
and
that
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
should
come
into
that
space
by
one
gate
,
with
ten
men
only
;
and
that
the
Dauphin
should
come
into
that
space
by
the
other
gate
,
also
with
ten
men
,
and
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
So
far
the
Dauphin
kept
his
word
,
but
no
farther
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
was
on
his
knee
before
him
in
the
act
of
speaking
,
one
of
the
Dauphin
's
noble
ruffians
cut
the
said
duke
down
with
a
small
axe
,
and
others
speedily
finished
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
vain
for
the
Dauphin
to
pretend
that
this
base
murder
was
not
done
with
his
consent
;
it
was
too
bad
,
even
for
France
,
and
caused
a
general
horror
.
 
<EOS>
The
duke
's
heir
hastened
to
make
a
treaty
with
King
Henry
,
and
the
French
Queen
engaged
that
her
husband
should
consent
to
it
,
whatever
it
was
.
 
<EOS>
Henry
made
peace
,
on
condition
of
receiving
the
Princess
Catherine
in
marriage
,
and
being
made
Regent
of
France
during
the
rest
of
the
King
's
lifetime
,
and
succeeding
to
the
French
crown
at
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
soon
married
to
the
beautiful
Princess
,
and
took
her
proudly
home
to
England
,
where
she
was
crowned
with
great
honour
and
glory
.
  
<EOS>
This
peace
was
called
the
Perpetual
Peace
;
we
shall
soon
see
how
long
it
lasted
.
 
<EOS>
It
gave
great
satisfaction
to
the
French
people
,
although
they
were
so
poor
and
miserable
,
that
,
at
the
time
of
the
celebration
of
the
Royal
marriage
,
numbers
of
them
were
dying
with
starvation
,
on
the
dunghills
in
the
streets
of
Paris
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
some
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
Dauphin
in
some
few
parts
of
France
,
but
King
Henry
beat
it
all
down
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
with
his
great
possessions
in
France
secured
,
and
<EOS>
his
beautiful
wife
to
cheer
him
,
and
a
son
born
to
give
him
greater
happiness
,
all
appeared
bright
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
fulness
of
his
triumph
and
the
height
of
his
power
,
Death
came
upon
him
,
and
his
day
was
done
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
fell
ill
at
Vincennes
,
and
found
that
he
could
not
recover
,
he
was
very
calm
and
quiet
,
and
spoke
serenely
to
those
who
wept
around
his
bed
.
 
<EOS>
His
wife
and
child
,
he
said
,
he
left
to
the
loving
care
of
his
brother
the
Duke
of
Bedford
,
and
his
other
faithful
nobles
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
them
his
advice
that
England
should
establish
a
friendship
with
the
new
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
and
offer
him
the
regency
of
France
;
that
it
should
not
set
free
the
royal
princes
who
had
been
taken
at
Agincourt
;
and
that
,
whatever
quarrel
might
arise
with
France
,
England
should
never
make
peace
without
holding
Normandy
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
laid
down
his
head
,
and
asked
the
attendant
priests
to
chant
the
penitential
psalms
.
 
<EOS>
Amid
which
solemn
sounds
,
on
the
thirty
-
first
of
August
,
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
twenty
-
two
,
in
only
the
thirty
-
fourth
year
of
his
age
and
the
tenth
of
his
reign
,
King
Henry
the
Fifth
passed
away
.
  
<EOS>
Slowly
<EOS>
and
mournfully
they
carried
his
embalmed
body
in
a
procession
of
great
state
to
Paris
,
and
thence
to
Rouen
where
his
Queen
was
:
 
from
whom
the
sad
intelligence
of
his
death
was
concealed
until
he
had
been
dead
some
days
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
,
lying
on
a
bed
of
crimson
and
gold
,
with
a
golden
crown
upon
the
head
,
and
a
golden
ball
and
sceptre
lying
in
the
nerveless
hands
,
they
carried
it
to
Calais
,
with
such
a
great
retinue
as
seemed
to
dye
the
road
black
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
of
Scotland
acted
as
chief
mourner
,
all
the
Royal
Household
followed
,
the
knights
wore
black
armour
and
black
plumes
of
feathers
,
crowds
of
men
bore
torches
,
making
the
night
as
light
as
day
;
and
the
widowed
Princess
followed
last
of
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
Calais
there
was
a
fleet
of
ships
to
bring
the
funeral
host
to
Dover
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
,
by
way
of
London
Bridge
,
where
the
service
for
the
dead
was
chanted
as
it
passed
along
,
they
brought
the
body
to
Westminster
Abbey
,
and
there
buried
it
with
great
respect
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Sixth
Part
<EOS>
the
First
    
IT
had
been
the
wish
of
the
late
King
,
that
while
his
infant
son
KING
HENRY
THE
SIXTH
,
at
this
time
only
nine
months
old
,
was
under
age
,
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
should
be
appointed
Regent
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
Parliament
,
however
,
preferred
to
appoint
a
Council
of
Regency
,
with
the
Duke
of
Bedford
at
its
head
:
 
to
be
represented
,
in
his
absence
only
,
by
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
would
seem
to
have
been
wise
in
this
,
for
Gloucester
soon
showed
himself
to
be
ambitious
and
troublesome
,
and
,
in
the
gratification
of
his
own
personal
schemes
,
gave
dangerous
offence
to
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
which
was
with
difficulty
adjusted
.
  
<EOS>
As
that
duke
declined
the
Regency
of
France
,
it
was
bestowed
by
the
poor
French
King
upon
the
Duke
of
Bedford
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
French
King
dying
within
two
months
,
the
Dauphin
instantly
asserted
his
claim
to
the
French
throne
,
and
was
actually
crowned
under
the
title
of
CHARLES
THE
SEVENTH
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Bedford
,
to
be
a
match
for
him
,
entered
into
a
friendly
league
with
the
Dukes
of
Burgundy
and
Brittany
,
and
gave
them
his
two
sisters
in
marriage
.
 
<EOS>
War
with
France
was
immediately
renewed
,
and
the
Perpetual
Peace
came
to
an
untimely
end
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
first
campaign
,
the
English
,
aided
by
this
alliance
,
were
speedily
successful
.
 
<EOS>
As
Scotland
,
however
,
had
sent
the
French
five
thousand
men
,
and
might
send
more
,
or
attack
the
North
of
England
while
England
was
busy
with
France
,
it
was
considered
that
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
offer
the
Scottish
King
,
James
,
who
had
been
so
long
imprisoned
,
his
liberty
,
on
his
paying
forty
thousand
pounds
for
his
board
and
lodging
during
nineteen
years
,
and
engaging
to
forbid
his
subjects
from
serving
under
the
flag
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
pleasant
to
know
,
not
only
that
the
amiable
captive
at
last
regained
his
freedom
upon
these
terms
,
but
,
that
he
married
a
noble
English
lady
,
with
whom
he
had
been
long
in
love
,
and
became
an
excellent
King
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
afraid
we
have
met
with
some
Kings
in
this
history
,
and
shall
meet
with
some
more
,
who
would
have
been
very
much
the
better
,
and
would
have
left
the
world
much
happier
,
if
they
had
been
imprisoned
nineteen
years
too
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
second
campaign
,
the
English
gained
a
considerable
victory
at
Verneuil
,
in
a
battle
which
was
chiefly
remarkable
,
otherwise
,
for
their
resorting
to
the
odd
expedient
of
tying
their
baggage
-
horses
together
by
the
heads
and
tails
,
and
jumbling
them
up
with
the
baggage
,
so
as
to
convert
them
into
a
sort
of
live
fortification
---
which
was
found
useful
to
the
troops
,
but
which
I
should
think
was
not
agreeable
to
the
horses
.
 
<EOS>
For
three
years
afterwards
very
little
was
done
,
owing
to
both
sides
being
too
poor
for
war
,
which
is
a
very
expensive
entertainment
;
but
,
a
council
was
then
held
in
Paris
,
in
which
it
was
decided
to
lay
siege
to
the
town
of
Orleans
,
which
was
a
place
of
great
importance
to
the
Dauphin
's
cause
.
 
<EOS>
An
English
army
of
ten
thousand
men
was
despatched
on
this
service
,
under
the
command
of
the
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
a
general
of
fame
.
 
<EOS>
He
being
unfortunately
killed
early
in
the
siege
,
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
took
his
place
;
under
whom
(
reinforced
by
SIR
JOHN
FALSTAFF
,
who
brought
up
four
hundred
waggons
laden
with
salt
herrings
and
other
provisions
for
the
troops
,
and
,
beating
off
the
French
who
tried
to
intercept
him
,
came
victorious
out
of
a
hot
skirmish
,
which
was
afterwards
called
in
jest
the
Battle
of
the
Herrings
)
<EOS>
the
town
of
Orleans
was
so
completely
hemmed
in
,
that
the
besieged
proposed
to
yield
it
up
to
their
countryman
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
general
,
however
,
replied
that
his
English
men
had
won
it
,
so
far
,
by
their
blood
and
valour
,
and
that
his
English
men
must
have
it
.
 
<EOS>
There
seemed
to
be
no
hope
for
the
town
,
or
for
the
Dauphin
,
who
was
so
dismayed
that
he
even
thought
of
flying
to
Scotland
or
to
Spain
---
when
a
peasant
girl
rose
up
and
changed
the
whole
state
of
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
The
story
of
this
peasant
girl
I
have
now
to
tell
.
  
<EOS>
Part
<EOS>
the
Second
:
 
<EOS>
The
Story
of
Joan
of
Arc
    
IN
a
remote
village
among
some
wild
hills
in
the
province
of
Lorraine
<EOS>
,
there
lived
a
countryman
whose
name
was
JACQUES
D'ARC
.
<EOS>
He
had
a
daughter
,
JOAN
OF
ARC
,
who
was
at
this
time
in
her
twentieth
year
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
a
solitary
girl
from
her
childhood
;
she
had
often
tended
sheep
and
cattle
for
whole
days
where
no
human
figure
was
seen
or
human
voice
heard
;
and
she
had
often
knelt
,
for
hours
together
,
in
the
gloomy
,
empty
,
little
village
chapel
,
looking
up
at
the
altar
and
at
the
dim
lamp
burning
before
it
,
until
she
fancied
that
she
saw
shadowy
figures
standing
there
,
and
even
that
she
heard
them
speak
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
in
that
part
of
France
were
very
ignorant
and
superstitious
,
and
they
had
many
ghostly
tales
to
tell
about
what
they
had
dreamed
,
and
what
they
saw
among
the
lonely
hills
when
the
clouds
and
the
mists
were
resting
on
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
they
easily
believed
that
Joan
saw
strange
sights
,
and
they
whispered
among
themselves
that
angels
and
spirits
talked
to
her
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
Joan
told
her
father
that
she
had
one
day
been
surprised
by
a
great
unearthly
light
,
and
had
afterwards
heard
a
solemn
voice
,
which
said
it
was
Saint
Michael
's
voice
,
telling
her
that
she
was
to
go
and
help
the
Dauphin
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
(
she
said
)
,
Saint
Catherine
and
Saint
Margaret
had
appeared
to
her
with
sparkling
crowns
upon
their
heads
,
and
had
encouraged
her
to
be
virtuous
and
resolute
.
 
<EOS>
These
visions
had
returned
sometimes
;
but
the
Voices
very
often
;
and
the
voices
always
said
,
"
Joan
,
thou
art
appointed
by
Heaven
to
go
and
help
the
Dauphin
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
almost
always
heard
them
while
the
chapel
bells
were
ringing
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
,
now
,
that
Joan
believed
she
saw
and
heard
these
things
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
well
known
that
such
delusions
are
a
disease
which
is
not
by
any
means
uncommon
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
probable
enough
that
there
were
figures
of
Saint
Michael
,
and
Saint
Catherine
,
and
Saint
Margaret
,
in
the
little
chapel
(
where
they
would
be
very
likely
to
have
shining
crowns
upon
their
heads
)
,
and
that
they
first
gave
Joan
the
idea
of
those
three
personages
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
long
been
a
moping
,
fanciful
girl
,
and
,
though
she
was
a
very
good
girl
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
she
was
a
little
vain
,
and
wishful
for
notoriety
.
  
<EOS>
Her
father
,
something
wiser
than
his
neighbours
,
said
,
"
I
tell
thee
,
Joan
,
it
is
thy
fancy
.
 
<EOS>
Thou
hadst
better
have
a
kind
husband
to
take
care
of
thee
,
girl
,
and
work
to
employ
thy
mind
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
Joan
told
him
in
reply
,
that
she
had
taken
a
vow
never
to
have
a
husband
,
and
that
she
must
go
as
Heaven
directed
her
,
to
help
the
Dauphin
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
,
unfortunately
for
her
father
's
persuasions
,
and
most
unfortunately
for
the
poor
girl
,
too
,
that
a
party
of
the
Dauphin
's
enemies
found
their
way
into
the
village
while
Joan
's
disorder
was
at
this
point
,
and
burnt
the
chapel
,
and
drove
out
the
inhabitants
.
<EOS>
The
cruelties
she
saw
committed
,
touched
Joan
's
heart
and
made
her
worse
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
that
the
voices
and
the
figures
were
now
continually
with
her
;
that
they
told
her
she
was
the
girl
who
,
according
to
an
old
prophecy
,
was
to
deliver
France
;
and
she
must
go
and
help
the
Dauphin
,
and
must
remain
with
him
until
he
should
be
crowned
at
Rheims
:
 
and
that
she
must
travel
a
long
way
to
a
certain
lord
named
BAUDRICOURT
,
who
could
and
would
,
bring
her
into
the
Dauphin
's
presence
.
  
<EOS>
As
her
father
still
said
,
"
I
tell
thee
,
Joan
,
it
is
thy
fancy
,
"
she
set
off
to
find
out
this
lord
,
accompanied
by
an
uncle
,
a
poor
village
wheelwright
and
cart
-
maker
,
who
believed
in
the
reality
of
her
visions
.
 
<EOS>
They
travelled
a
long
way
and
went
on
and
on
,
over
a
rough
country
,
full
of
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
's
men
,
and
of
all
kinds
of
robbers
and
marauders
,
until
they
came
to
where
this
lord
was
.
  
<EOS>
When
his
servants
told
him
that
there
was
a
poor
peasant
girl
named
Joan
of
Arc
,
accompanied
by
nobody
but
an
old
village
wheelwright
and
cart
-
maker
,
who
wished
to
see
him
because
she
was
commanded
to
help
the
Dauphin
and
save
France
,
Baudricourt
burst
out
a
-
laughing
,
and
bade
them
send
the
girl
away
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
soon
heard
so
much
about
her
lingering
in
the
town
,
and
praying
in
the
churches
,
and
seeing
visions
,
and
doing
harm
to
no
one
,
that
he
sent
for
her
,
and
questioned
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
said
the
same
things
after
she
had
been
well
sprinkled
with
holy
water
as
she
had
said
before
the
sprinkling
,
Baudricourt
began
to
think
there
might
be
something
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
At
all
events
,
he
thought
it
worth
while
to
send
her
on
to
the
town
of
Chinon
,
where
the
Dauphin
was
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
bought
her
a
horse
,
and
a
sword
,
and
gave
her
two
squires
to
conduct
her
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
Voices
had
told
Joan
that
she
was
to
wear
a
man
's
dress
,
now
,
she
put
one
on
,
and
girded
her
sword
to
her
side
,
and
bound
spurs
to
her
heels
,
and
mounted
her
horse
and
rode
away
with
her
two
squires
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
her
uncle
the
wheelwright
,
he
stood
staring
at
his
niece
in
wonder
until
she
was
out
of
sight
---
<EOS>
as
well
he
might
---
and
then
went
home
again
.
 
<EOS>
The
best
place
,
too
.
  
<EOS>
Joan
and
her
two
squires
rode
on
and
on
,
until
they
came
to
Chinon
,
where
she
was
,
after
some
doubt
,
<EOS>
admitted
into
the
Dauphin
's
presence
.
 
<EOS>
Picking
him
out
immediately
from
all
his
court
,
she
told
him
that
she
came
commanded
by
Heaven
to
subdue
his
enemies
and
conduct
him
to
his
coronation
at
Rheims
.
 
<EOS>
She
also
told
him
(
or
he
pretended
so
afterwards
,
to
make
the
greater
impression
upon
his
soldiers
)
<EOS>
a
number
of
his
secrets
known
only
to
himself
,
and
<EOS>
,
furthermore
,
she
said
there
was
an
old
,
old
sword
in
the
cathedral
of
Saint
Catherine
at
Fierbois
,
marked
with
five
old
crosses
on
the
blade
,
which
Saint
Catherine
had
ordered
her
to
wear
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
nobody
knew
anything
about
this
old
,
old
sword
,
but
when
the
cathedral
came
to
be
examined
---
which
was
immediately
done
---
there
,
sure
enough
,
the
sword
was
found
!
 
<EOS>
The
Dauphin
then
required
a
number
of
grave
priests
and
bishops
to
give
him
their
opinion
whether
the
girl
derived
her
power
from
good
spirits
or
from
evil
spirits
,
which
they
held
prodigiously
long
debates
about
,
in
the
course
of
which
several
learned
men
fell
fast
asleep
and
snored
loudly
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
when
one
gruff
old
gentleman
had
said
to
Joan
,
"
What
language
do
your
Voices
speak
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
Joan
had
replied
to
the
gruff
old
gentleman
,
"
A
pleasanter
language
than
yours
,
"
they
agreed
that
it
was
all
correct
,
and
that
Joan
of
Arc
was
inspired
from
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
This
wonderful
circumstance
put
new
heart
into
the
Dauphin
's
soldiers
when
they
heard
of
it
,
and
dispirited
the
English
army
,
who
took
Joan
for
a
witch
.
  
<EOS>
So
Joan
mounted
horse
again
,
and
again
rode
on
and
on
,
until
she
came
to
Orleans
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
rode
now
,
as
never
peasant
girl
had
ridden
yet
.
 
<EOS>
She
rode
upon
a
white
war
-
horse
,
in
a
suit
of
glittering
armour
;
<EOS>
with
the
old
,
old
sword
from
the
cathedral
,
newly
burnished
,
in
her
belt
;
with
a
white
flag
carried
before
her
,
upon
which
were
a
picture
of
God
,
and
the
words
JESUS
MARIA
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
splendid
state
,
at
the
head
of
a
great
body
of
troops
escorting
provisions
of
all
kinds
for
the
starving
inhabitants
of
Orleans
,
she
appeared
before
that
beleaguered
city
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
people
on
the
walls
beheld
her
,
they
cried
out
"
<EOS>
The
Maid
is
come
!
 
<EOS>
The
Maid
of
the
Prophecy
is
come
to
deliver
us
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
this
,
and
the
sight
of
the
Maid
fighting
at
the
head
of
their
men
,
made
the
French
so
bold
,
and
made
the
English
so
fearful
,
that
the
English
line
of
forts
was
soon
broken
,
the
troops
and
provisions
were
got
into
the
town
,
and
Orleans
was
saved
.
  
<EOS>
Joan
,
henceforth
called
THE
MAID
OF
ORLEANS
,
remained
within
the
walls
for
a
few
days
,
and
caused
letters
to
be
thrown
over
,
ordering
Lord
Suffolk
and
his
Englishmen
to
depart
from
before
the
town
according
to
the
will
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
English
general
very
positively
declined
to
believe
that
Joan
knew
anything
about
the
will
of
Heaven
(
which
did
not
mend
the
matter
with
his
soldiers
,
for
they
stupidly
said
if
she
were
not
inspired
she
was
a
witch
,
and
it
was
of
no
use
to
fight
against
a
witch
)
,
she
mounted
her
white
war
-
horse
again
,
and
ordered
her
white
banner
to
advance
.
  
<EOS>
The
besiegers
held
the
bridge
,
and
some
strong
towers
upon
the
bridge
;
and
here
the
Maid
of
Orleans
attacked
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
fight
was
fourteen
hours
long
.
 
<EOS>
She
planted
a
scaling
ladder
with
her
own
hands
,
and
mounted
a
tower
wall
,
but
was
struck
by
an
English
arrow
in
the
neck
,
and
fell
into
the
trench
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
carried
away
and
the
arrow
was
taken
out
,
during
which
operation
she
screamed
and
cried
with
the
pain
,
as
any
other
girl
might
have
done
;
but
presently
she
said
that
the
Voices
were
speaking
to
her
and
soothing
her
to
rest
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
while
,
she
got
up
,
and
was
again
foremost
in
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
English
who
had
seen
her
fall
and
supposed
her
dead
,
saw
this
,
they
were
troubled
with
the
strangest
fears
,
and
some
of
them
cried
out
that
they
beheld
Saint
Michael
on
a
white
horse
(
probably
Joan
herself
)
fighting
for
the
French
.
<EOS>
They
lost
the
bridge
,
and
lost
the
towers
,
and
next
day
set
their
chain
of
forts
on
fire
,
and
left
the
place
.
  
<EOS>
But
as
Lord
Suffolk
himself
retired
no
farther
than
the
town
of
Jargeau
,
which
was
only
a
few
miles
off
,
the
Maid
of
Orleans
besieged
him
there
,
and
he
was
taken
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
white
banner
scaled
the
wall
,
she
was
struck
upon
the
head
with
a
stone
,
and
was
again
tumbled
down
into
the
ditch
;
but
,
she
only
cried
all
the
more
,
as
she
lay
there
,
"
On
,
on
,
my
countrymen
!
 
<EOS>
And
fear
nothing
,
for
the
Lord
hath
delivered
them
into
our
hands
!
"
 
<EOS>
After
this
new
success
of
the
Maid
's
,
several
other
fortresses
and
places
which
had
previously
held
out
against
the
Dauphin
were
delivered
up
without
a
battle
;
and
at
Patay
she
defeated
the
remainder
of
the
English
army
,
and
set
up
her
victorious
white
banner
on
a
field
where
twelve
hundred
Englishmen
lay
dead
.
  
<EOS>
She
now
urged
the
Dauphin
(
who
always
kept
out
of
the
way
when
there
was
any
fighting
)
to
proceed
to
Rheims
,
as
the
first
part
of
her
mission
was
accomplished
;
and
to
complete
the
whole
by
being
crowned
there
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dauphin
was
in
no
particular
hurry
to
do
this
,
as
Rheims
was
a
long
way
off
,
and
the
English
and
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
were
still
strong
in
the
country
through
which
the
road
lay
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
they
set
forth
,
with
ten
thousand
men
,
and
again
the
Maid
of
Orleans
rode
on
and
on
,
upon
her
white
war
-
horse
,
and
in
her
shining
armour
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
they
came
to
a
town
which
yielded
readily
,
the
soldiers
believed
in
her
;
but
,
whenever
they
came
to
a
town
which
gave
them
any
trouble
,
they
began
to
murmur
that
she
was
an
impostor
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
was
particularly
the
case
at
Troyes
,
which
finally
yielded
,
however
,
through
the
persuasion
of
one
Richard
,
a
friar
of
the
place
.
 
<EOS>
Friar
Richard
was
in
the
old
doubt
about
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
until
he
had
sprinkled
her
well
with
holy
water
,
and
had
also
well
sprinkled
the
threshold
of
the
gate
by
which
she
came
into
the
city
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
that
it
made
no
change
in
her
or
the
gate
,
he
said
,
as
the
other
grave
old
gentlemen
had
said
,
that
it
was
all
right
,
and
became
her
great
ally
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
at
last
,
by
dint
of
riding
on
and
on
,
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
and
the
Dauphin
,
and
the
ten
thousand
sometimes
believing
and
sometimes
unbelieving
men
,
came
to
Rheims
.
 
<EOS>
And
in
the
great
cathedral
of
Rheims
,
the
Dauphin
actually
was
crowned
Charles
the
Seventh
in
a
great
assembly
of
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Maid
,
who
with
her
white
banner
stood
beside
the
King
in
that
hour
of
his
triumph
,
kneeled
down
upon
the
pavement
at
his
feet
,
and
said
,
with
tears
,
that
what
she
had
been
inspired
to
do
,
was
done
,
and
that
the
only
recompense
she
asked
for
,
was
,
that
she
should
now
have
leave
to
go
back
to
her
distant
home
,
and
her
sturdily
incredulous
father
,
and
her
first
simple
escort
the
village
wheelwright
and
cart
-
maker
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
said
"
No
!
"
and
made
her
and
her
family
as
noble
as
a
King
could
,
and
settled
upon
her
the
income
of
a
Count
.
  
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
happy
<EOS>
had
it
been
for
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
if
she
had
resumed
her
rustic
dress
that
day
,
and
had
gone
home
to
the
little
chapel
and
the
wild
hills
,
and
had
forgotten
all
these
things
,
and
had
been
a
good
man
's
wife
,
and
had
heard
no
stranger
voices
than
the
voices
of
little
children
!
  
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
,
and
she
continued
helping
the
King
<EOS>
(
she
did
a
world
for
him
,
in
alliance
with
Friar
Richard
)
,
and
trying
to
improve
the
lives
of
the
coarse
soldiers
,
and
leading
a
religious
,
an
unselfish
,
and
a
modest
life
,
herself
,
beyond
any
doubt
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
many
times
she
prayed
the
King
to
let
her
go
home
;
and
once
she
even
took
off
her
bright
armour
and
hung
it
up
in
a
church
,
meaning
never
to
wear
it
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
King
always
won
her
back
again
---
while
she
was
of
any
use
to
him
---
and
so
she
went
on
and
on
and
on
,
to
her
doom
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
Duke
of
Bedford
,
who
was
a
very
able
man
,
began
to
be
active
for
England
,
and
,
by
bringing
the
war
back
into
France
and
by
holding
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
to
his
faith
,
to
distress
and
disturb
Charles
very
much
,
Charles
sometimes
asked
the
Maid
of
Orleans
what
the
Voices
said
about
it
?
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Voices
had
become
(
very
like
ordinary
voices
in
perplexed
times
)
contradictory
and
confused
,
so
that
now
they
said
one
thing
,
and
now
said
another
,
and
the
Maid
lost
credit
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
marched
on
Paris
,
which
was
opposed
to
him
,
and
attacked
the
suburb
of
Saint
Honore
.
<EOS>
In
this
fight
,
being
again
struck
down
into
the
ditch
,
she
was
abandoned
by
the
whole
army
.
 
<EOS>
She
lay
unaided
among
a
heap
of
dead
,
and
crawled
out
how
she
could
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
some
of
her
believers
went
over
to
an
opposition
Maid
,
Catherine
of
La
Rochelle
,
who
said
she
was
inspired
to
tell
where
there
were
treasures
of
buried
money
---
though
she
never
did
---
and
then
Joan
accidentally
broke
the
old
,
old
sword
,
and
others
said
that
her
power
was
broken
with
it
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
at
the
siege
of
Compiägne
,
held
by
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
,
where
she
did
valiant
service
,
she
was
basely
left
alone
in
a
retreat
,
though
facing
about
and
fighting
to
the
last
;
and
an
archer
pulled
her
off
her
horse
.
  
<EOS>
O
<EOS>
the
uproar
that
was
made
,
and
the
thanksgivings
that
were
sung
,
about
the
capture
of
this
one
poor
country
-
girl
!
 
<EOS>
O
the
way
in
which
she
was
demanded
to
be
tried
for
sorcery
and
heresy
,
and
anything
else
you
like
,
by
the
Inquisitor
-
General
of
France
,
and
by
this
great
man
,
and
by
that
great
man
,
until
it
is
wearisome
to
think
of
!
<EOS>
She
was
bought
at
last
by
the
Bishop
of
Beauvais
for
ten
thousand
francs
,
and
was
shut
up
in
her
narrow
prison
:
 
plain
Joan
of
Arc
again
,
and
Maid
of
Orleans
no
more
.
  
<EOS>
I
should
never
have
done
if
I
were
to
tell
you
how
they
had
Joan
out
to
examine
her
,
and
cross
-
examine
her
,
and
re
-
examine
her
,
and
worry
her
into
saying
anything
and
everything
;
and
how
all
sorts
of
scholars
and
doctors
bestowed
their
utmost
tediousness
upon
her
.
<EOS>
Sixteen
times
she
was
brought
out
and
shut
up
again
,
and
worried
,
and
entrapped
,
and
argued
with
,
until
she
was
heart
-
sick
of
the
dreary
business
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
last
occasion
of
this
kind
she
was
brought
into
a
burial
-
place
at
Rouen
,
dismally
decorated
with
a
scaffold
,
and
a
stake
and
faggots
,
and
the
executioner
,
and
a
pulpit
with
a
friar
therein
,
and
an
awful
sermon
ready
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
affecting
to
know
that
even
at
that
pass
the
poor
girl
honoured
the
mean
vermin
of
a
King
,
who
had
so
used
her
for
his
purposes
and
so
abandoned
her
;
and
,
that
while
she
had
been
regardless
of
reproaches
heaped
upon
herself
,
she
spoke
out
courageously
for
him
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
natural
in
one
so
young
to
hold
to
life
.
 
<EOS>
To
save
her
life
,
she
signed
a
declaration
prepared
for
her
---
signed
it
with
a
cross
,
for
she
could
n't
write
---
that
all
her
visions
and
Voices
had
come
from
the
Devil
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
her
recanting
the
past
,
and
protesting
that
she
would
never
wear
a
man
's
dress
in
future
,
she
was
condemned
to
imprisonment
for
life
,
"
on
the
bread
of
sorrow
and
the
water
of
affliction
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
bread
of
sorrow
and
the
water
of
affliction
,
the
visions
and
the
Voices
soon
returned
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
quite
natural
that
they
should
do
so
,
for
that
kind
of
disease
is
much
aggravated
by
fasting
,
loneliness
,
and
anxiety
of
mind
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
only
got
out
of
Joan
that
she
considered
herself
inspired
again
,
but
,
she
was
taken
in
a
man
's
dress
,
which
had
been
left
---
to
entrap
her
---
in
her
prison
,
and
which
she
put
on
,
in
her
solitude
;
perhaps
,
in
remembrance
of
her
past
glories
,
perhaps
,
because
the
imaginary
Voices
told
her
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
relapse
into
the
sorcery
and
heresy
and
anything
else
you
like
,
she
was
sentenced
to
be
burnt
to
death
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
the
market
-
place
of
Rouen
,
in
the
hideous
dress
which
the
monks
had
invented
for
such
spectacles
;
with
priests
and
bishops
sitting
in
a
gallery
looking
on
,
though
some
had
the
Christian
grace
to
go
away
,
unable
to
endure
the
infamous
scene
;
this
shrieking
girl
---
last
seen
amidst
the
smoke
and
fire
,
holding
a
crucifix
between
her
hands
;
last
heard
,
calling
upon
Christ
---
was
burnt
to
ashes
.
 
<EOS>
They
threw
her
ashes
into
the
river
Seine
;
but
they
will
rise
against
her
murderers
on
the
last
day
.
  
<EOS>
From
the
moment
of
her
capture
,
neither
the
French
King
nor
one
single
man
in
all
his
court
raised
a
finger
to
save
her
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
no
defence
of
them
that
they
may
have
never
really
believed
in
her
,
or
that
they
may
have
won
her
victories
by
their
skill
and
bravery
.
<EOS>
The
more
they
pretended
to
believe
in
her
,
the
more
they
had
caused
her
to
believe
in
herself
;
and
she
had
ever
been
true
to
them
,
ever
brave
,
ever
nobly
devoted
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
it
is
no
wonder
,
that
they
,
who
were
in
all
things
false
to
themselves
,
false
to
one
another
,
false
to
their
country
,
false
to
Heaven
,
false
to
Earth
,
should
be
monsters
of
ingratitude
and
treachery
to
a
helpless
peasant
girl
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
picturesque
old
town
of
Rouen
,
where
weeds
and
grass
grow
high
on
the
cathedral
towers
,
and
the
venerable
Norman
streets
are
still
warm
in
the
blessed
sunlight
though
the
monkish
fires
that
once
gleamed
horribly
upon
them
have
long
grown
cold
,
there
is
a
statue
of
Joan
of
Arc
,
in
the
scene
of
her
last
agony
,
the
square
to
which
she
has
given
its
present
name
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
some
statues
of
modern
times
---
even
in
the
World
's
metropolis
,
I
think
---
which
commemorate
less
constancy
,
less
earnestness
,
smaller
claims
upon
the
world
's
attention
,
and
much
greater
impostors
.
  
<EOS>
Part
the
Third
    
BAD
deeds
seldom
prosper
,
happily
for
mankind
;
and
the
English
cause
gained
no
advantage
from
the
cruel
death
of
Joan
of
Arc
.
 
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
,
the
war
went
heavily
on
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Bedford
died
;
the
alliance
with
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
was
broken
;
and
Lord
Talbot
became
a
great
general
on
the
English
side
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
two
of
the
consequences
of
wars
are
,
Famine
---
because
the
people
can
not
peacefully
cultivate
the
ground
---
and
Pestilence
,
which
comes
of
want
,
misery
,
and
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
Both
these
horrors
broke
out
in
both
countries
,
and
lasted
for
two
wretched
years
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
war
went
on
again
,
and
came
by
slow
degrees
to
be
so
badly
conducted
by
the
English
government
,
that
,
within
twenty
years
from
the
execution
of
the
Maid
of
Orleans
,
of
all
the
great
French
conquests
,
the
town
of
Calais
alone
remained
in
English
hands
.
  
<EOS>
While
these
victories
and
defeats
were
taking
place
in
the
course
of
time
,
many
strange
things
happened
at
home
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
King
,
as
he
grew
up
,
proved
to
be
very
unlike
his
great
father
,
and
showed
himself
a
miserable
puny
creature
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
no
harm
in
him
---
he
had
a
great
aversion
to
shedding
blood
:
 
which
was
something
---
but
,
he
was
a
weak
,
silly
,
helpless
young
man
,
and
a
mere
shuttlecock
to
the
great
lordly
battledores
about
the
Court
.
  
<EOS>
Of
these
battledores
,
Cardinal
Beaufort
,
a
relation
of
the
King
,
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
were
at
first
the
most
powerful
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
had
a
wife
,
who
was
nonsensically
accused
of
practising
witchcraft
to
cause
the
King
's
death
and
lead
to
her
husband
's
coming
to
the
throne
,
he
being
the
next
heir
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
charged
with
having
,
by
the
help
of
a
ridiculous
old
woman
named
Margery
(
who
was
called
a
witch
)
<EOS>
,
made
a
little
waxen
doll
in
the
King
's
likeness
,
and
put
it
before
a
slow
fire
that
it
might
gradually
melt
away
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
,
in
such
cases
,
that
the
death
of
the
person
whom
the
doll
was
made
to
represent
,
was
sure
to
happen
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
the
duchess
was
as
ignorant
as
the
rest
of
them
,
and
really
did
make
such
a
doll
with
such
an
intention
,
I
do
n't
know
;
<EOS>
but
,
you
and
I
know
very
well
that
she
might
have
made
a
thousand
dolls
,
if
she
had
been
stupid
enough
,
and
might
have
melted
them
all
,
without
hurting
the
King
or
anybody
else
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
was
tried
for
it
,
and
so
was
old
Margery
,
and
so
was
one
of
the
duke
's
chaplains
,
who
was
charged
with
having
assisted
them
.
 
<EOS>
Both
he
and
Margery
were
put
to
death
,
and
the
duchess
,
after
being
taken
on
foot
and
bearing
a
lighted
candle
,
three
times
round
the
City
,
as
a
penance
,
was
imprisoned
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
The
duke
,
himself
,
took
all
this
pretty
quietly
,
and
made
as
little
stir
about
the
matter
as
if
he
were
rather
glad
to
be
rid
of
the
duchess
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
not
destined
to
keep
himself
out
of
trouble
long
.
 
<EOS>
The
royal
shuttlecock
being
three
-
and
-
twenty
,
the
battledores
were
very
anxious
to
get
him
married
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
wanted
him
to
marry
a
daughter
of
the
Count
of
Armagnac
;
but
,
the
Cardinal
and
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
were
all
for
MARGARET
,
the
daughter
of
the
King
of
Sicily
,
who
they
knew
was
a
resolute
,
ambitious
woman
and
would
govern
the
King
as
she
chose
.
 
<EOS>
To
make
friends
with
this
lady
,
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
,
who
went
over
to
arrange
the
match
,
consented
to
accept
her
for
the
King
's
wife
without
any
fortune
,
and
even
to
give
up
the
two
most
valuable
possessions
England
then
had
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
marriage
was
arranged
,
on
terms
very
advantageous
to
the
lady
;
and
Lord
Suffolk
brought
her
to
England
,
and
she
was
married
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
On
what
pretence
this
queen
and
her
party
charged
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
with
high
treason
within
a
couple
of
years
,
it
is
impossible
to
make
out
,
the
matter
is
so
confused
;
but
,
they
pretended
that
the
King
's
life
was
in
danger
,
and
they
took
the
duke
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
A
fortnight
afterwards
,
he
was
found
dead
in
bed
(
they
said
)
,
and
his
body
was
shown
to
the
people
,
and
Lord
Suffolk
came
in
for
the
best
part
of
his
estates
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
by
this
time
how
strangely
liable
state
prisoners
were
to
sudden
death
.
  
<EOS>
If
Cardinal
Beaufort
had
any
hand
in
this
matter
,
it
did
him
<EOS>
no
good
,
for
he
died
within
six
weeks
;
thinking
it
very
hard
and
curious
---
at
eighty
years
old
!
---
that
he
could
not
live
to
be
Pope
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
the
time
when
England
had
completed
her
loss
of
all
her
great
French
conquests
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
charged
the
loss
principally
upon
the
Earl
of
Suffolk
,
now
a
duke
,
who
had
made
those
easy
terms
about
the
Royal
Marriage
,
and
who
,
they
believed
,
had
even
been
bought
by
France
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
was
impeached
as
a
traitor
,
on
a
great
number
of
charges
,
but
chiefly
on
accusations
of
having
aided
the
French
King
,
and
of
designing
to
make
his
own
son
King
of
England
.
<EOS>
The
Commons
and
the
people
being
violent
against
him
,
the
King
was
made
(
by
his
friends
)
to
interpose
to
save
him
,
by
banishing
him
for
five
years
,
and
proroguing
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
The
duke
had
much
ado
to
escape
from
a
London
mob
,
two
thousand
strong
,
who
lay
in
wait
for
him
in
St
Giles
's
fields
;
but
,
he
got
down
to
his
own
estates
in
Suffolk
,
and
sailed
away
from
Ipswich
.
 
<EOS>
Sailing
across
the
Channel
,
he
sent
into
Calais
to
know
if
he
might
land
there
;
but
,
they
kept
his
boat
and
men
in
the
harbour
,
until
an
English
ship
,
carrying
a
hundred
and
fifty
men
and
called
the
Nicholas
of
the
Tower
,
came
alongside
his
little
vessel
,
and
ordered
him
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
"
Welcome
,
traitor
,
as
men
say
,
"
was
the
captain
's
grim
and
not
very
respectful
salutation
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
kept
on
board
,
a
prisoner
,
for
eight
-
and
-
forty
hours
,
and
then
a
small
boat
appeared
rowing
toward
the
ship
.
 
<EOS>
As
this
boat
came
nearer
,
it
was
seen
to
have
in
it
a
block
,
a
rusty
sword
,
and
an
executioner
in
a
black
mask
.
 
<EOS>
The
duke
was
handed
down
into
it
,
and
there
his
head
was
cut
off
with
six
strokes
of
the
rusty
sword
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
little
boat
rowed
away
to
Dover
beach
,
where
the
body
was
cast
out
,
and
left
until
the
duchess
claimed
it
.
 
<EOS>
By
whom
,
high
in
authority
,
this
murder
was
committed
,
has
never
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
was
ever
punished
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
now
arose
in
Kent
an
Irishman
,
who
gave
himself
the
name
of
Mortimer
,
but
whose
real
name
was
JACK
CADE
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
,
in
imitation
of
Wat
Tyler
,
though
he
was
a
very
different
and
inferior
sort
of
man
,
addressed
the
Kentish
men
upon
their
wrongs
,
occasioned
by
the
bad
government
of
England
,
among
so
many
battledores
and
such
a
poor
shuttlecock
;
and
the
Kentish
men
rose
up
to
the
number
of
twenty
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
Their
place
of
assembly
was
Blackheath
,
where
,
headed
by
Jack
,
they
put
forth
two
papers
,
which
they
called
"
The
Complaint
of
the
Commons
of
Kent
,
"
and
"
The
Requests
of
the
Captain
of
the
Great
Assembly
in
Kent
.
"
 
<EOS>
They
then
retired
to
Sevenoaks
.
 
<EOS>
The
royal
army
coming
up
with
them
here
,
they
beat
it
and
killed
their
general
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
Jack
dressed
himself
in
the
dead
general
's
armour
,
and
led
his
men
to
London
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
passed
into
the
City
from
Southwark
,
over
the
bridge
,
and
entered
it
in
triumph
,
giving
the
strictest
orders
to
his
men
not
to
plunder
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
a
show
of
his
forces
there
,
while
the
citizens
looked
on
quietly
,
he
went
back
into
Southwark
in
good
order
,
and
passed
the
night
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
he
came
back
again
,
having
got
hold
in
the
meantime
of
Lord
Say
,
an
unpopular
nobleman
.
 
<EOS>
Says
Jack
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
judges
:
 
<EOS>
"
Will
you
be
so
good
as
to
make
a
tribunal
in
Guildhall
,
and
try
me
this
nobleman
?
"
 
<EOS>
The
court
being
hastily
made
,
he
was
found
guilty
,
and
Jack
and
his
men
cut
his
head
off
on
Cornhill
.
 
<EOS>
They
also
cut
off
the
head
of
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
and
then
went
back
in
good
order
to
Southwark
again
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
although
the
citizens
could
bear
the
beheading
of
an
unpopular
lord
,
they
could
not
bear
to
have
their
houses
pillaged
.
 
<EOS>
And
it
did
so
happen
that
Jack
,
after
dinner
---
perhaps
he
had
drunk
a
little
too
much
---
began
to
plunder
the
house
where
he
lodged
;
upon
which
,
of
course
,
his
men
began
to
imitate
him
.
 
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
the
Londoners
took
counsel
with
Lord
Scales
,
who
had
a
thousand
soldiers
in
the
Tower
;
and
defended
London
Bridge
,
and
kept
Jack
and
his
people
out
.
 
<EOS>
This
advantage
gained
,
it
was
resolved
by
divers
great
men
to
divide
Jack
's
army
in
the
old
way
,
by
making
a
great
many
promises
on
behalf
of
the
state
,
that
were
never
intended
to
be
performed
.
 
<EOS>
This
DID
divide
them
;
some
of
Jack
's
men
saying
that
they
ought
to
take
the
conditions
which
were
offered
,
and
others
saying
that
they
ought
not
,
for
they
were
only
a
snare
;
some
going
home
at
once
;
others
staying
where
they
were
;
and
all
doubting
and
quarrelling
among
themselves
.
  
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
was
in
two
minds
about
fighting
or
accepting
a
pardon
,
and
who
indeed
did
both
,
saw
at
last
that
there
was
nothing
to
expect
from
his
men
,
and
that
it
was
very
likely
some
of
them
would
deliver
him
up
and
get
a
reward
of
a
thousand
marks
,
which
was
offered
for
his
apprehension
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
they
had
travelled
and
quarrelled
all
the
way
from
Southwark
to
Blackheath
,
and
from
Blackheath
to
Rochester
,
he
mounted
a
good
horse
and
galloped
away
into
Sussex
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
there
galloped
after
him
,
on
a
better
horse
,
one
Alexander
Iden
,
who
came
up
with
him
,
had
a
hard
fight
with
him
,
and
killed
him
.
 
<EOS>
Jack
's
head
was
set
aloft
on
London
Bridge
,
with
the
face
looking
towards
Blackheath
,
where
he
had
raised
his
flag
;
and
Alexander
Iden
got
the
thousand
marks
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
by
some
,
that
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
had
been
removed
from
a
high
post
abroad
through
the
Queen
's
influence
,
and
sent
out
of
the
way
,
to
govern
Ireland
,
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
rising
of
Jack
and
his
men
,
because
he
wanted
to
trouble
the
government
.
 
<EOS>
He
claimed
(
though
not
yet
publicly
)
to
have
a
better
right
to
the
throne
than
Henry
of
Lancaster
,
as
one
of
the
family
of
the
Earl
of
March
,
whom
Henry
the
Fourth
had
set
aside
.
 
<EOS>
Touching
this
claim
,
which
,
being
through
female
relationship
,
was
not
according
to
the
usual
descent
,
it
is
enough
to
say
that
Henry
the
Fourth
was
the
free
choice
of
the
people
and
the
Parliament
,
and
that
his
family
had
now
reigned
undisputed
for
sixty
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
memory
of
Henry
the
Fifth
was
so
famous
,
and
the
English
people
loved
it
so
much
,
that
the
Duke
of
York
's
claim
would
,
perhaps
,
never
have
been
thought
of
<EOS>
(
it
would
have
been
so
hopeless
)
but
for
the
unfortunate
circumstance
of
the
present
King
's
being
by
this
time
quite
an
idiot
,
and
the
country
very
ill
governed
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
circumstances
gave
the
Duke
of
York
a
power
he
could
not
otherwise
have
had
.
  
<EOS>
Whether
the
Duke
knew
anything
of
Jack
Cade
,
or
not
,
he
came
over
from
Ireland
while
Jack
's
head
was
on
London
Bridge
;
being
secretly
advised
that
the
Queen
was
setting
up
his
enemy
,
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
Westminster
,
at
the
head
of
four
thousand
men
,
and
on
his
knees
before
the
King
,
represented
to
him
the
bad
state
of
the
country
,
and
petitioned
him
to
summon
a
Parliament
to
consider
it
.
 
<EOS>
This
the
King
promised
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Parliament
was
summoned
,
the
Duke
of
York
accused
the
Duke
of
Somerset
,
and
the
Duke
of
Somerset
accused
the
Duke
of
York
;
and
,
both
in
and
out
of
Parliament
,
the
followers
of
each
party
were
full
of
violence
and
hatred
towards
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
the
Duke
of
York
put
himself
at
the
head
of
a
large
force
of
his
tenants
,
and
,
in
arms
,
demanded
the
reformation
of
the
Government
.
 
<EOS>
Being
shut
out
of
London
,
he
encamped
at
Dartford
,
and
the
royal
army
encamped
at
Blackheath
.
 
<EOS>
According
as
either
side
triumphed
,
the
Duke
of
York
was
arrested
,
or
the
Duke
of
Somerset
was
arrested
.
<EOS>
The
trouble
ended
,
for
the
moment
,
in
the
Duke
of
York
renewing
his
oath
of
allegiance
,
and
going
in
peace
to
one
of
his
own
castles
.
  
<EOS>
Half
a
year
afterwards
the
Queen
gave
birth
to
a
son
,
who
was
very
ill
received
by
the
people
,
and
not
believed
to
be
the
son
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
It
shows
the
Duke
of
York
to
have
been
a
moderate
man
,
unwilling
to
involve
England
in
new
troubles
,
that
he
did
not
take
advantage
of
the
general
discontent
at
this
time
,
but
really
acted
for
the
public
good
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
made
a
member
of
the
cabinet
,
and
the
King
being
now
so
much
worse
that
he
could
not
be
carried
about
and
shown
to
the
people
with
any
decency
,
the
duke
was
made
Lord
Protector
of
the
kingdom
,
until
the
King
should
recover
,
or
the
Prince
should
come
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
the
Duke
of
Somerset
was
committed
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
now
the
Duke
of
Somerset
was
down
,
and
the
Duke
of
York
was
up
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
end
of
the
year
,
however
,
the
King
recovered
his
memory
and
some
spark
of
sense
;
upon
which
the
Queen
used
her
power
---
which
recovered
with
him
---
to
get
the
Protector
disgraced
,
and
her
favourite
released
.
 
<EOS>
So
now
the
Duke
of
York
was
down
,
and
the
Duke
of
Somerset
was
up
.
  
<EOS>
These
ducal
ups
and
downs
gradually
separated
the
whole
nation
into
the
two
parties
of
York
and
Lancaster
,
and
led
to
those
terrible
civil
wars
long
known
as
the
Wars
of
the
Red
and
White
Roses
,
because
the
red
rose
was
the
badge
of
the
House
of
Lancaster
,
and
the
white
rose
was
the
badge
of
the
House
of
York
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
York
,
joined
by
some
other
powerful
noblemen
of
the
White
Rose
party
,
and
leading
a
small
army
,
met
the
King
with
another
small
army
at
St
Alban
's
,
and
demanded
that
the
Duke
of
Somerset
should
be
given
up
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
King
,
being
made
to
say
in
answer
that
he
would
sooner
die
,
was
instantly
attacked
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Somerset
was
killed
,
and
the
King
himself
was
wounded
in
the
neck
,
and
took
refuge
in
the
house
of
a
poor
tanner
.
 
<EOS>
Whereupon
,
the
Duke
of
York
went
to
him
,
led
him
with
great
submission
to
the
Abbey
,
and
said
he
was
very
sorry
for
what
had
happened
.
 
<EOS>
Having
now
the
King
in
his
possession
,
he
got
a
Parliament
summoned
and
himself
once
more
made
Protector
,
but
,
only
for
a
few
months
;
for
,
on
the
King
getting
a
little
better
again
,
the
Queen
and
her
party
got
him
into
their
possession
,
and
disgraced
the
Duke
once
more
.
<EOS>
So
,
now
the
Duke
of
York
was
down
again
.
  
<EOS>
Some
of
the
best
men
in
power
,
seeing
the
danger
of
these
constant
changes
,
tried
even
then
to
prevent
the
Red
and
the
White
Rose
Wars
.
 
<EOS>
They
brought
about
a
great
council
in
London
between
the
two
parties
.
 
<EOS>
The
White
Roses
assembled
in
Blackfriars
,
the
Red
Roses
in
Whitefriars
;
and
some
good
priests
communicated
between
them
,
and
made
the
proceedings
known
at
evening
to
the
King
and
the
judges
.
 
<EOS>
They
ended
in
a
peaceful
agreement
that
there
should
be
no
more
quarrelling
;
and
there
was
a
great
royal
procession
to
St
Paul
's
,
in
which
the
Queen
walked
arm
-
in
-
arm
with
her
old
enemy
,
the
Duke
of
York
,
to
show
the
people
how
comfortable
they
all
were
.
<EOS>
This
state
of
peace
lasted
half
a
year
,
when
a
dispute
between
the
Earl
of
Warwick
(
one
of
the
Duke
's
powerful
friends
)
and
some
of
the
King
's
servants
at
Court
,
led
to
an
attack
upon
that
Earl
---
who
was
a
White
Rose
---
and
to
a
sudden
breaking
out
of
all
old
animosities
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
here
were
greater
ups
and
downs
than
ever
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
even
greater
ups
and
downs
than
these
,
soon
after
.
<EOS>
After
various
battles
,
the
Duke
of
York
fled
to
Ireland
,
and
his
son
the
Earl
of
March
to
Calais
,
with
their
friends
the
Earls
of
Salisbury
and
Warwick
;
and
a
Parliament
was
held
declaring
them
all
traitors
.
 
<EOS>
Little
the
worse
for
this
<EOS>
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
presently
came
back
,
landed
in
Kent
,
was
joined
by
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
and
other
powerful
noblemen
and
gentlemen
,
engaged
the
King
's
forces
at
Northampton
,
signally
defeated
them
,
and
took
the
King
himself
prisoner
,
who
was
found
in
his
tent
.
 
<EOS>
Warwick
would
have
been
glad
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
to
have
taken
the
Queen
and
Prince
too
,
but
they
escaped
into
Wales
and
thence
into
Scotland
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
was
carried
by
the
victorious
force
straight
to
London
,
and
made
to
call
a
new
Parliament
,
which
immediately
declared
that
the
Duke
of
York
and
those
other
noblemen
were
not
traitors
,
but
excellent
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
back
comes
the
Duke
from
Ireland
at
the
head
of
five
hundred
horsemen
,
rides
from
London
to
Westminster
,
and
enters
the
House
of
Lords
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
cloth
of
gold
which
covered
the
empty
throne
,
as
if
he
had
half
a
mind
to
sit
down
in
it
---
but
he
did
not
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
asking
him
if
he
would
visit
the
King
,
who
was
in
his
palace
close
by
,
he
replied
,
"
I
know
no
one
in
this
country
,
my
lord
,
who
ought
not
to
visit
ME
.
"
 
<EOS>
None
of
the
lords
present
spoke
a
single
word
;
so
,
the
duke
went
out
as
he
had
come
in
,
established
himself
royally
in
the
King
's
palace
,
and
,
six
days
afterwards
,
sent
in
to
the
Lords
a
formal
statement
of
his
claim
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
The
lords
went
to
the
King
on
this
momentous
subject
,
and
after
a
great
deal
of
discussion
,
in
which
the
judges
and
the
other
law
officers
were
afraid
to
give
an
opinion
on
either
side
,
the
question
was
compromised
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
the
present
King
should
retain
the
crown
for
his
life
,
and
that
it
should
then
pass
to
the
Duke
of
York
and
his
heirs
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
resolute
Queen
,
determined
on
asserting
her
son
's
right
,
would
hear
of
no
such
thing
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
from
Scotland
to
the
north
of
England
,
where
several
powerful
lords
armed
in
her
cause
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
York
,
for
his
part
,
set
off
with
some
five
thousand
men
,
a
little
time
before
Christmas
Day
,
one
thousand
four
hundred
and
sixty
,
to
give
her
battle
.
 
<EOS>
He
lodged
at
Sandal
Castle
,
near
Wakefield
,
and
the
Red
Roses
defied
him
to
come
out
on
Wakefield
Green
,
and
fight
them
then
and
there
.
 
<EOS>
His
generals
said
,
he
had
best
wait
until
his
gallant
son
,
the
Earl
of
March
,
came
up
with
his
power
;
but
,
he
was
determined
to
accept
the
challenge
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
,
in
an
evil
hour
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
hotly
pressed
on
all
sides
,
two
thousand
of
his
men
lay
dead
on
Wakefield
Green
,
and
he
himself
was
taken
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
They
set
him
down
in
mock
state
on
an
ant
-
hill
,
and
twisted
grass
about
his
head
,
and
pretended
to
pay
court
to
him
on
their
knees
,
saying
,
"
O
King
,
without
a
kingdom
,
and
Prince
without
a
people
,
we
hope
your
gracious
Majesty
is
very
well
and
happy
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
did
worse
than
this
;
they
cut
his
head
off
,
and
handed
it
on
a
pole
to
the
Queen
,
who
laughed
with
delight
when
she
saw
it
<EOS>
(
you
recollect
their
walking
so
religiously
and
comfortably
to
St
Paul
's
!
)
,
and
had
it
fixed
,
with
a
paper
crown
upon
its
head
,
on
the
walls
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Salisbury
lost
his
head
,
too
;
and
the
Duke
of
York
's
second
son
,
a
handsome
boy
who
was
flying
with
his
tutor
over
Wakefield
Bridge
,
was
stabbed
in
the
heart
by
a
murderous
,
lord
---
Lord
Clifford
by
name
---
whose
father
had
been
killed
by
the
White
Roses
in
the
fight
at
St
Alban
's
.
<EOS>
There
was
awful
sacrifice
of
life
in
this
battle
,
for
no
quarter
was
given
,
and
the
Queen
was
wild
for
revenge
.
 
<EOS>
When
men
unnaturally
fight
against
their
own
countrymen
,
they
are
always
observed
to
be
more
unnaturally
cruel
and
filled
with
rage
than
they
are
against
any
other
enemy
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
Clifford
had
stabbed
the
second
son
of
the
Duke
of
York
---
not
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
The
eldest
son
,
Edward
Earl
of
March
,
was
at
Gloucester
;
and
,
vowing
vengeance
for
the
death
of
his
father
,
his
brother
,
and
their
faithful
friends
,
he
began
to
march
against
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
to
turn
and
fight
a
great
body
of
Welsh
and
Irish
first
,
who
worried
his
advance
.
 
<EOS>
These
he
defeated
in
a
great
fight
at
Mortimer
's
Cross
,
near
Hereford
,
where
he
beheaded
a
number
of
the
Red
Roses
taken
in
battle
,
in
retaliation
for
the
beheading
of
the
White
Roses
at
Wakefield
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
had
the
next
turn
of
beheading
.
 
<EOS>
Having
moved
towards
London
,
and
falling
in
,
between
St
Alban
's
and
Barnet
,
with
the
Earl
of
Warwick
and
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
White
Roses
both
,
who
were
there
with
an
army
to
oppose
her
,
and
had
got
the
King
with
them
;
she
defeated
them
with
great
loss
,
and
struck
off
the
heads
of
two
prisoners
of
note
,
who
were
in
the
King
's
tent
with
him
,
and
to
whom
the
King
had
promised
his
protection
.
 
<EOS>
Her
triumph
,
however
,
was
very
short
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
no
treasure
,
and
her
army
subsisted
by
plunder
.
 
<EOS>
This
caused
them
to
be
hated
and
dreaded
by
the
people
,
and
particularly
by
the
London
people
,
who
were
wealthy
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
Londoners
heard
that
Edward
,
Earl
of
March
,
united
with
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
was
advancing
towards
the
city
,
they
refused
to
send
the
Queen
supplies
,
and
made
a
great
rejoicing
.
  
<EOS>
The
Queen
and
her
men
retreated
with
all
speed
,
and
Edward
and
Warwick
came
on
,
greeted
with
loud
acclamations
on
every
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
courage
,
beauty
,
and
virtues
of
young
Edward
could
not
be
sufficiently
praised
by
the
whole
people
.
 
<EOS>
He
rode
into
London
like
a
conqueror
,
and
met
with
an
enthusiastic
welcome
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
days
afterwards
,
Lord
Falconbridge
and
the
Bishop
of
Exeter
assembled
the
citizens
in
St
John
's
Field
,
Clerkenwell
,
and
asked
them
if
they
would
have
Henry
of
Lancaster
for
their
King
?
 
<EOS>
To
this
they
all
roared
,
"
No
,
no
,
no
!
"
and
"
King
Edward
!
 
<EOS>
King
Edward
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
said
those
noblemen
,
would
they
love
and
serve
young
Edward
?
 
<EOS>
To
this
they
all
cried
,
"
Yes
,
yes
!
"
and
threw
up
their
caps
and
clapped
their
hands
,
and
cheered
tremendously
.
  
<EOS>
Therefore
,
it
was
declared
that
by
joining
the
Queen
and
not
protecting
those
two
prisoners
of
note
,
Henry
of
Lancaster
had
forfeited
the
crown
;
and
Edward
of
York
was
proclaimed
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
great
speech
to
the
applauding
people
at
Westminster
,
and
sat
down
as
sovereign
of
England
on
that
throne
,
on
the
golden
covering
of
which
his
father
---
worthy
of
a
better
fate
than
the
bloody
axe
which
cut
the
thread
of
so
many
lives
in
England
,
through
so
many
years
---
had
laid
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
Fourth
    
KING
EDWARD
<EOS>
THE
FOURTH
was
not
quite
twenty
-
one
years
of
age
when
he
took
that
unquiet
seat
upon
the
throne
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lancaster
party
,
the
Red
Roses
,
were
then
assembling
in
great
numbers
near
York
,
and
it
was
necessary
to
give
them
battle
instantly
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
stout
Earl
of
Warwick
leading
for
the
young
King
,
and
the
young
King
himself
closely
following
him
,
and
the
English
people
crowding
round
the
Royal
standard
,
the
White
and
the
Red
Roses
met
,
on
a
wild
March
day
when
the
snow
was
falling
heavily
,
at
Towton
;
and
there
such
a
furious
battle
raged
between
them
,
that
the
total
loss
amounted
to
forty
thousand
men
---
all
Englishmen
,
fighting
,
upon
English
ground
,
against
one
another
.
<EOS>
The
young
King
gained
the
day
,
took
down
the
heads
of
his
father
and
brother
from
the
walls
of
York
,
and
put
up
the
heads
of
some
of
the
most
famous
noblemen
engaged
in
the
battle
on
the
other
side
.
<EOS>
Then
,
he
went
to
London
and
was
crowned
with
great
splendour
.
  
<EOS>
A
new
Parliament
met
.
 
<EOS>
No
fewer
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
of
the
principal
noblemen
and
gentlemen
on
the
Lancaster
side
were
declared
traitors
,
and
the
King
---
who
had
very
little
humanity
,
though
he
was
handsome
in
person
and
agreeable
in
manners
---
resolved
to
do
all
he
could
,
to
pluck
up
the
Red
Rose
root
and
branch
.
  
<EOS>
Queen
Margaret
,
however
,
was
still
active
for
her
young
son
.
 
<EOS>
She
obtained
help
from
Scotland
and
from
Normandy
,
and
took
several
important
English
castles
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Warwick
soon
retook
them
;
the
Queen
lost
all
her
treasure
on
board
ship
in
a
great
storm
;
and
both
she
and
her
son
suffered
great
misfortunes
.
 
<EOS>
Once
,
in
the
winter
weather
,
as
they
were
riding
through
a
forest
,
they
were
attacked
and
plundered
by
a
party
of
robbers
;
and
,
when
they
had
escaped
from
these
men
and
were
passing
alone
and
on
foot
through
a
thick
dark
part
of
the
wood
,
they
came
,
all
at
once
,
upon
another
robber
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
Queen
,
with
a
stout
heart
,
took
the
little
Prince
by
the
hand
,
and
going
straight
up
to
that
robber
,
said
to
him
,
"
My
friend
,
this
is
the
young
son
of
your
lawful
King
!
 
<EOS>
I
confide
him
to
your
care
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
robber
was
surprised
,
but
took
the
boy
in
his
arms
,
and
faithfully
restored
him
and
his
mother
to
their
friends
.
<EOS>
In
the
end
,
the
Queen
's
soldiers
being
beaten
and
dispersed
,
she
went
abroad
again
,
and
kept
quiet
for
the
present
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
all
this
time
,
the
deposed
King
Henry
was
concealed
by
a
Welsh
knight
,
who
kept
him
close
in
his
castle
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
next
year
,
the
Lancaster
party
recovering
their
spirits
,
raised
a
large
body
of
men
,
and
called
him
out
of
his
retirement
,
to
put
him
at
their
head
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
joined
by
some
powerful
noblemen
who
had
sworn
fidelity
to
the
new
King
,
but
who
were
ready
,
as
usual
,
to
break
their
oaths
,
whenever
they
thought
there
was
anything
to
be
got
by
it
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
worst
things
in
the
history
of
the
war
of
the
Red
and
White
Roses
,
is
the
ease
with
which
these
noblemen
,
who
should
have
set
an
example
of
honour
to
the
people
,
left
either
side
as
they
took
slight
offence
,
or
were
disappointed
in
their
greedy
expectations
,
and
joined
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Well
!
<EOS>
Warwick
's
brother
soon
beat
the
Lancastrians
,
and
the
false
noblemen
,
being
taken
,
were
beheaded
without
a
moment
's
loss
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
deposed
King
had
a
narrow
escape
;
three
of
his
servants
were
taken
,
and
one
of
them
bore
his
cap
of
estate
,
which
was
set
with
pearls
and
embroidered
with
two
golden
crowns
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
head
to
which
the
cap
belonged
,
got
safely
into
Lancashire
,
and
lay
pretty
quietly
there
(
the
people
in
the
secret
being
very
true
)
for
more
than
a
year
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
an
old
monk
gave
such
intelligence
as
led
to
Henry
's
being
taken
while
he
was
sitting
at
dinner
in
a
place
called
Waddington
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
sent
to
London
,
and
met
at
Islington
by
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
by
whose
directions
he
was
put
upon
a
horse
,
with
his
legs
tied
under
it
,
and
paraded
three
times
round
the
pillory
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
was
carried
off
to
the
Tower
,
where
they
treated
him
well
enough
.
  
<EOS>
The
White
Rose
being
so
triumphant
,
the
young
King
abandoned
himself
entirely
to
pleasure
,
and
led
a
jovial
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
thorns
were
springing
up
under
his
bed
of
roses
,
as
he
soon
found
out
.
<EOS>
For
,
having
been
privately
married
to
ELIZABETH
WOODVILLE
,
a
young
widow
lady
,
very
beautiful
and
very
captivating
;
and
at
last
resolving
to
make
his
secret
known
,
and
to
declare
her
his
Queen
;
he
gave
some
offence
to
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
who
was
usually
called
the
King
-
Maker
,
because
of
his
power
and
influence
,
and
because
of
his
having
lent
such
great
help
to
placing
Edward
on
the
throne
.
<EOS>
This
offence
was
not
lessened
by
the
jealousy
with
which
the
Nevil
family
(
the
Earl
of
Warwick
's
)
regarded
the
promotion
of
the
Woodville
family
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
young
Queen
was
so
bent
on
providing
for
her
relations
,
that
she
made
her
father
an
earl
and
a
great
officer
of
state
;
married
her
five
sisters
to
young
noblemen
of
the
highest
rank
;
and
provided
for
her
younger
brother
,
a
young
man
of
twenty
,
by
marrying
him
to
an
immensely
rich
old
duchess
of
eighty
.
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Warwick
took
all
this
pretty
graciously
for
a
man
of
his
proud
temper
,
until
the
question
arose
to
whom
the
King
's
sister
,
MARGARET
,
should
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Warwick
said
,
"
To
one
of
the
French
King
's
sons
,
"
and
was
allowed
to
go
over
to
the
French
King
to
make
friendly
proposals
for
that
purpose
,
and
to
hold
all
manner
of
friendly
interviews
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
while
he
was
so
engaged
,
the
Woodville
party
married
the
young
lady
to
the
Duke
of
Burgundy
!
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
he
came
back
in
great
rage
and
scorn
,
and
shut
himself
up
discontented
,
in
his
Castle
of
Middleham
.
  
<EOS>
A
reconciliation
,
though
not
a
very
sincere
one
,
was
patched
up
between
the
Earl
of
Warwick
and
the
King
,
and
lasted
until
the
Earl
married
his
daughter
,
against
the
King
's
wishes
,
to
the
Duke
of
Clarence
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
marriage
was
being
celebrated
at
Calais
,
the
people
in
the
north
of
England
,
where
the
influence
of
the
Nevil
family
was
strongest
,
broke
out
into
rebellion
;
their
complaint
was
,
that
England
was
oppressed
and
plundered
by
the
Woodville
family
,
whom
they
demanded
to
have
removed
from
power
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
were
joined
by
great
numbers
of
people
,
and
as
they
openly
declared
that
they
were
supported
by
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
the
King
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
as
he
wrote
to
the
earl
beseeching
his
aid
,
he
and
his
new
son
-
in
-
law
came
over
to
England
,
and
began
to
arrange
the
business
by
shutting
the
King
up
in
Middleham
Castle
in
the
safe
keeping
of
the
Archbishop
of
York
;
so
England
was
not
only
in
the
strange
position
of
having
two
kings
at
once
,
but
they
were
both
prisoners
at
the
same
time
.
  
<EOS>
Even
as
yet
,
however
,
the
King
-
Maker
was
so
far
true
to
the
King
,
that
he
dispersed
a
new
rising
of
the
Lancastrians
,
took
their
leader
prisoner
,
and
brought
him
to
the
King
,
who
ordered
him
to
be
immediately
executed
.
 
<EOS>
He
presently
allowed
the
King
to
return
to
London
,
and
there
innumerable
pledges
of
forgiveness
and
friendship
were
exchanged
between
them
,
and
between
the
Nevils
and
the
Woodvilles
;
the
King
's
eldest
daughter
was
promised
in
marriage
to
the
heir
of
the
Nevil
family
;
and
more
friendly
oaths
were
sworn
,
and
<EOS>
more
friendly
promises
made
,
than
this
book
would
hold
.
  
<EOS>
They
lasted
about
three
months
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
end
of
that
time
,
the
Archbishop
of
York
made
a
feast
for
the
King
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
and
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
at
his
house
,
the
Moor
,
in
Hertfordshire
.
<EOS>
The
King
was
washing
his
hands
before
supper
,
when
some
one
whispered
him
that
a
body
of
a
hundred
men
were
lying
in
ambush
outside
the
house
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
this
were
true
or
untrue
,
the
King
took
fright
,
mounted
his
horse
,
and
rode
through
the
dark
night
to
Windsor
Castle
.
 
<EOS>
Another
reconciliation
was
patched
up
between
him
and
the
King
-
Maker
,
but
it
was
a
short
one
,
and
it
was
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
A
new
rising
took
place
in
Lincolnshire
,
and
the
King
marched
to
repress
it
.
 
<EOS>
Having
done
so
,
he
proclaimed
that
both
the
Earl
of
Warwick
and
the
Duke
of
Clarence
were
traitors
,
who
had
secretly
assisted
it
,
and
who
had
been
prepared
publicly
to
join
it
on
the
following
day
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
dangerous
circumstances
they
both
took
ship
and
sailed
away
to
the
French
court
.
  
<EOS>
And
here
a
meeting
took
place
between
the
Earl
of
Warwick
and
his
old
enemy
,
the
Dowager
Queen
Margaret
,
through
whom
his
father
had
had
his
head
struck
off
,
and
to
whom
he
had
been
a
bitter
foe
.
<EOS>
But
,
now
,
when
he
said
that
he
had
done
with
the
ungrateful
and
perfidious
Edward
of
York
,
and
that
henceforth
he
devoted
himself
to
the
restoration
of
the
House
of
Lancaster
,
either
in
the
person
of
her
husband
or
of
her
little
son
,
she
embraced
him
as
if
he
had
ever
been
her
dearest
friend
.
 
<EOS>
She
did
more
than
that
;
she
married
her
son
to
his
second
daughter
,
the
Lady
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
However
agreeable
this
marriage
was
to
the
new
friends
,
it
was
very
disagreeable
to
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
perceived
that
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
the
King
-
Maker
,
would
never
make
HIM
King
,
now
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
being
but
a
weak
-
minded
young
traitor
,
possessed
of
very
little
worth
or
sense
,
he
readily
listened
to
an
artful
court
lady
sent
over
for
the
purpose
,
and
promised
to
turn
traitor
once
more
,
and
go
over
to
his
brother
,
King
Edward
,
when
a
fitting
opportunity
should
come
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Warwick
,
knowing
nothing
of
this
,
soon
redeemed
his
promise
to
the
Dowager
Queen
Margaret
,
by
invading
England
and
landing
at
Plymouth
,
where
he
instantly
proclaimed
King
Henry
,
and
summoned
all
Englishmen
between
the
ages
of
sixteen
and
sixty
,
to
join
his
banner
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
with
his
army
increasing
as
he
marched
along
,
he
went
northward
,
and
came
so
near
King
Edward
,
who
was
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
that
Edward
had
to
ride
hard
for
it
to
the
coast
of
Norfolk
,
and
thence
to
get
away
in
such
ships
as
he
could
find
,
to
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
triumphant
King
-
Maker
and
his
false
son
-
in
-
law
,
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
went
to
London
,
took
the
old
King
out
of
the
Tower
,
and
walked
him
in
a
great
procession
to
Saint
Paul
's
Cathedral
with
the
crown
upon
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
This
did
not
improve
the
temper
of
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
saw
himself
farther
off
from
being
King
than
ever
;
but
he
kept
his
secret
,
and
said
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
Nevil
family
were
restored
to
all
their
honours
and
glories
,
and
the
Woodvilles
and
the
rest
were
disgraced
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
-
Maker
,
less
sanguinary
than
the
King
,
shed
no
blood
except
that
of
the
Earl
of
Worcester
,
who
had
been
so
cruel
to
the
people
as
to
have
gained
the
title
of
the
Butcher
.
 
<EOS>
Him
<EOS>
they
caught
hidden
in
a
tree
,
and
him
they
tried
and
executed
.
 
<EOS>
No
other
death
stained
the
King
-
Maker
's
triumph
.
  
<EOS>
To
dispute
this
triumph
,
back
came
King
Edward
again
,
next
year
,
landing
at
Ravenspur
,
coming
on
to
York
,
causing
all
his
men
to
cry
"
Long
live
King
Henry
!
"
and
swearing
on
the
altar
,
without
a
blush
,
that
he
came
to
lay
no
claim
to
the
crown
.
 
<EOS>
Now
was
the
time
for
the
Duke
of
Clarence
,
who
ordered
his
men
to
assume
the
White
Rose
,
and
declare
for
his
brother
.
 
<EOS>
The
Marquis
of
Montague
,
though
the
Earl
of
Warwick
's
brother
,
also
declining
to
fight
against
King
Edward
,
he
went
on
successfully
to
London
,
where
the
Archbishop
of
York
let
him
into
the
City
,
and
where
the
people
made
great
demonstrations
in
his
favour
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
they
had
four
reasons
.
<EOS>
Firstly
,
there
were
great
numbers
of
the
King
's
adherents
hiding
in
the
City
and
ready
to
break
out
;
secondly
,
the
King
owed
them
a
great
deal
of
money
,
which
they
could
never
hope
to
get
if
he
were
unsuccessful
;
thirdly
,
there
was
a
young
prince
to
inherit
the
crown
;
and
fourthly
,
the
King
was
gay
and
handsome
,
and
more
popular
than
a
better
man
might
have
been
with
the
City
ladies
.
<EOS>
After
a
stay
of
only
two
days
with
these
worthy
supporters
,
the
King
marched
out
to
Barnet
Common
,
to
give
the
Earl
of
Warwick
battle
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
it
was
to
be
seen
,
for
the
last
time
,
whether
the
King
or
the
King
-
Maker
was
to
carry
the
day
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
battle
was
yet
pending
,
the
fainthearted
Duke
of
Clarence
began
to
repent
,
and
sent
over
secret
messages
to
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
offering
his
services
in
mediation
with
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
disdainfully
rejected
them
,
and
replied
that
Clarence
was
false
and
perjured
,
and
that
he
would
settle
the
quarrel
by
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
The
battle
began
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
and
lasted
until
ten
,
and
during
the
greater
part
of
the
time
it
was
fought
in
a
thick
mist
---
absurdly
supposed
to
be
raised
by
a
magician
.
 
<EOS>
The
loss
of
life
was
very
great
,
for
the
hatred
was
strong
on
both
sides
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
-
Maker
was
defeated
,
and
the
King
triumphed
.
 
<EOS>
Both
the
Earl
of
Warwick
and
his
brother
were
slain
,
and
their
bodies
lay
in
St
Paul
's
,
for
some
days
,
as
a
spectacle
to
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Margaret
's
spirit
was
not
broken
even
by
this
great
blow
.
 
<EOS>
Within
five
days
she
was
in
arms
again
,
and
raised
her
standard
in
Bath
,
whence
she
set
off
with
her
army
,
to
try
and
join
Lord
Pembroke
,
who
had
a
force
in
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
King
,
coming
up
with
her
outside
the
town
of
Tewkesbury
,
and
ordering
his
brother
,
the
DUKE
OF
GLOUCESTER
,
who
was
a
brave
soldier
,
to
attack
her
men
,
she
sustained
an
entire
defeat
,
and
was
taken
prisoner
,
together
with
her
son
,
now
only
eighteen
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
The
conduct
of
the
King
to
this
poor
youth
was
worthy
of
his
cruel
character
.
 
<EOS>
He
ordered
him
to
be
led
into
his
tent
.
 
<EOS>
"
And
what
,
"
said
he
,
"
brought
YOU
to
England
?
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
came
to
England
,
"
replied
the
prisoner
,
with
a
spirit
which
a
man
of
spirit
might
have
admired
in
a
captive
,
"
to
recover
my
father
's
kingdom
,
which
descended
to
him
as
his
right
,
and
from
him
descends
to
me
,
as
mine
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
drawing
off
his
iron
gauntlet
,
struck
him
with
it
in
the
face
;
and
the
Duke
of
Clarence
and
some
other
lords
,
who
were
there
,
drew
their
noble
swords
,
and
killed
him
.
  
<EOS>
His
mother
survived
him
,
a
prisoner
,
for
five
years
;
after
her
ransom
by
the
King
of
France
,
she
survived
for
six
years
more
.
<EOS>
Within
three
weeks
of
this
murder
,
Henry
died
one
of
those
convenient
sudden
deaths
which
were
so
common
in
the
Tower
;
in
plainer
words
,
he
was
murdered
by
the
King
's
order
.
  
<EOS>
Having
no
particular
excitement
on
his
hands
after
this
great
defeat
of
the
Lancaster
party
,
and
being
perhaps
desirous
to
get
rid
of
some
of
his
fat
(
for
he
was
now
getting
too
corpulent
to
be
handsome
)
,
the
King
thought
of
making
war
on
France
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
wanted
more
money
for
this
purpose
than
the
Parliament
could
give
him
,
though
they
were
usually
ready
enough
for
war
,
he
invented
a
new
way
of
raising
it
,
by
sending
for
the
principal
citizens
of
London
,
and
telling
them
,
with
a
grave
face
,
that
he
was
very
much
in
want
of
cash
,
and
would
take
it
very
kind
in
them
if
they
would
lend
him
some
.
 
<EOS>
It
being
impossible
for
them
safely
to
refuse
,
they
complied
,
and
the
moneys
thus
forced
from
them
were
called
---
no
doubt
to
the
great
amusement
of
the
King
and
the
Court
---
as
if
they
were
free
gifts
,
"
Benevolences
.
"
 
<EOS>
What
with
grants
from
Parliament
,
and
what
with
Benevolences
,
the
King
raised
an
army
and
passed
over
to
Calais
.
 
<EOS>
As
nobody
wanted
war
,
however
,
the
French
King
made
proposals
of
peace
,
which
were
accepted
,
and
a
truce
was
concluded
for
seven
long
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
proceedings
between
the
Kings
of
France
and
England
on
this
occasion
,
were
very
friendly
,
very
splendid
,
and
very
distrustful
.
 
<EOS>
They
finished
with
a
meeting
between
the
two
Kings
,
on
a
temporary
bridge
over
the
river
Somme
,
where
they
embraced
through
two
holes
in
a
strong
wooden
grating
like
a
lion
's
cage
,
and
made
several
bows
and
fine
speeches
to
one
another
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
time
,
now
,
that
the
Duke
of
Clarence
should
be
punished
for
his
treacheries
;
and
Fate
had
his
punishment
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
,
probably
,
not
trusted
by
the
King
---
for
who
could
trust
him
who
knew
him
!
<EOS>
---
<EOS>
and
he
had
certainly
a
powerful
opponent
in
his
brother
Richard
,
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
who
,
being
avaricious
and
ambitious
,
wanted
to
marry
that
widowed
daughter
of
the
Earl
of
Warwick
's
who
had
been
espoused
to
the
deceased
young
Prince
,
at
Calais
.
<EOS>
Clarence
,
who
wanted
all
the
family
wealth
for
himself
,
secreted
this
lady
,
whom
Richard
found
disguised
as
a
servant
in
the
City
of
London
,
and
whom
he
married
;
arbitrators
appointed
by
the
King
,
then
divided
the
property
between
the
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
This
led
to
ill
-
will
and
mistrust
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
Clarence
's
wife
dying
,
and
he
wishing
to
make
another
marriage
,
which
was
obnoxious
to
the
King
<EOS>
,
his
ruin
was
hurried
by
that
means
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
the
Court
struck
at
his
retainers
and
dependents
,
and
accused
some
of
them
of
magic
and
witchcraft
,
and
similar
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
Successful
against
this
small
game
,
it
then
mounted
to
the
Duke
himself
,
who
was
impeached
by
his
brother
the
King
,
in
person
,
on
a
variety
of
such
charges
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
found
guilty
,
and
sentenced
to
be
publicly
executed
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
was
publicly
executed
,
but
he
met
his
death
somehow
,
in
the
Tower
,
and
,
no
doubt
,
through
some
agency
of
the
King
or
his
brother
Gloucester
,
or
both
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
supposed
at
the
time
that
he
was
told
to
choose
the
manner
of
his
death
,
and
that
he
chose
to
be
drowned
in
a
butt
of
Malmsey
wine
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
the
story
may
be
true
,
for
it
would
have
been
a
becoming
death
for
such
a
miserable
creature
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
survived
him
some
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
in
the
forty
-
second
year
of
his
life
,
and
the
twenty
-
third
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
very
good
capacity
and
some
good
points
,
but
he
was
selfish
,
careless
,
sensual
,
and
cruel
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
favourite
with
the
people
for
his
showy
manners
;
and
the
people
were
a
good
example
to
him
in
the
constancy
of
their
attachment
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
penitent
on
his
death
-
bed
for
his
"
benevolences
,
"
and
other
extortions
,
and
ordered
restitution
to
be
made
to
the
people
who
had
suffered
from
them
.
<EOS>
He
also
called
about
his
bed
the
enriched
members
of
the
Woodville
family
,
and
the
proud
lords
whose
honours
were
of
older
date
,
and
endeavoured
to
reconcile
them
,
for
the
sake
of
the
peaceful
succession
of
his
son
and
the
tranquillity
of
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
the
Fifth
    
<EOS>
THE
late
King
's
eldest
son
,
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
called
EDWARD
after
him
,
was
only
thirteen
years
of
age
at
his
father
's
death
.
<EOS>
He
was
at
Ludlow
Castle
with
his
uncle
,
the
Earl
of
Rivers
.
 
<EOS>
The
prince
's
brother
,
the
Duke
of
York
,
only
eleven
years
of
age
,
was
in
London
with
his
mother
.
 
<EOS>
The
boldest
,
most
crafty
,
and
most
dreaded
nobleman
in
England
at
that
time
was
their
uncle
RICHARD
,
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
and
everybody
wondered
how
the
two
poor
boys
would
fare
with
such
an
uncle
for
a
friend
or
a
foe
.
  
<EOS>
The
Queen
,
their
mother
,
being
exceedingly
uneasy
about
this
,
was
anxious
that
instructions
should
be
sent
to
Lord
Rivers
to
raise
an
army
to
escort
the
young
King
safely
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Lord
Hastings
,
who
was
of
the
Court
party
opposed
to
the
Woodvilles
,
and
who
disliked
the
thought
of
giving
them
that
power
,
<EOS>
argued
against
the
proposal
,
and
obliged
the
Queen
to
be
satisfied
with
an
escort
of
two
thousand
horse
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
did
nothing
,
at
first
,
to
justify
suspicion
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
from
Scotland
(
where
he
was
commanding
an
army
)
to
York
,
and
was
there
the
first
to
swear
allegiance
to
his
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
wrote
a
condoling
letter
to
the
Queen
-
Mother
,
and
set
off
to
be
present
at
the
coronation
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
young
King
,
journeying
towards
London
too
,
with
Lord
Rivers
and
Lord
Gray
,
came
to
Stony
Stratford
,
as
his
uncle
came
to
Northampton
,
about
ten
miles
distant
;
and
when
those
two
lords
heard
that
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
was
so
near
,
they
proposed
to
the
young
King
that
they
should
go
back
and
greet
him
in
his
name
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
being
very
willing
that
they
should
do
so
,
they
rode
off
and
were
received
with
great
friendliness
,
and
asked
by
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
to
stay
and
dine
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
while
they
were
merry
together
,
up
came
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
with
three
hundred
horsemen
;
and
next
morning
the
two
lords
and
the
two
dukes
,
and
the
three
hundred
horsemen
,
rode
away
together
to
rejoin
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
Just
as
they
were
entering
Stony
Stratford
,
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
checking
his
horse
,
turned
suddenly
on
the
two
lords
,
charged
them
with
alienating
from
him
the
affections
of
his
sweet
nephew
,
and
caused
them
to
be
arrested
by
the
three
hundred
horsemen
and
taken
back
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
and
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
went
straight
to
the
King
(
whom
they
had
now
in
their
power
)
,
to
whom
they
made
a
show
of
kneeling
down
,
and
offering
great
love
and
submission
;
and
then
they
ordered
his
attendants
to
disperse
,
and
took
him
,
alone
with
them
,
to
Northampton
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
days
afterwards
they
conducted
him
to
London
,
and
lodged
him
in
the
Bishop
's
Palace
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
did
not
remain
there
long
;
for
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
with
a
tender
face
made
a
speech
expressing
how
anxious
he
was
for
the
Royal
boy
's
safety
,
and
how
much
safer
he
would
be
in
the
Tower
until
his
coronation
,
than
he
could
be
anywhere
else
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
to
the
Tower
he
was
taken
,
very
carefully
,
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
was
named
Protector
of
the
State
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Gloucester
had
proceeded
thus
far
with
a
very
smooth
countenance
---
and
although
he
was
a
clever
man
,
fair
of
speech
,
and
not
ill
-
looking
,
in
spite
of
one
of
his
shoulders
being
something
higher
than
the
other
---
and
although
he
had
come
into
the
City
riding
bare
-
headed
at
the
King
's
side
,
and
looking
very
fond
of
him
---
he
had
made
the
King
's
mother
more
uneasy
yet
;
and
when
the
Royal
boy
was
taken
to
the
Tower
,
she
became
so
alarmed
that
she
took
sanctuary
in
Westminster
with
her
five
daughters
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
do
this
without
reason
,
for
,
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
finding
that
the
lords
who
were
opposed
to
the
Woodville
family
were
faithful
to
the
young
King
nevertheless
,
quickly
resolved
to
strike
a
blow
for
himself
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
while
those
lords
met
in
council
at
the
Tower
,
he
and
those
who
were
in
his
interest
met
in
separate
council
at
his
own
residence
,
Crosby
Palace
,
in
Bishopsgate
Street
.
 
<EOS>
Being
at
last
quite
prepared
,
he
one
day
appeared
unexpectedly
at
the
council
in
the
Tower
,
and
appeared
to
be
very
jocular
and
merry
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
particularly
gay
with
the
Bishop
of
Ely
:
 
praising
the
strawberries
that
grew
in
his
garden
on
Holborn
Hill
,
and
asking
him
to
have
some
gathered
that
he
might
eat
them
at
dinner
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
,
quite
proud
of
the
honour
,
sent
one
of
his
men
to
fetch
some
;
and
the
Duke
,
still
very
jocular
and
gay
,
went
out
;
and
the
council
all
said
what
a
very
agreeable
duke
he
was
!
 
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
,
however
,
he
came
back
quite
altered
---
not
at
all
jocular
---
frowning
and
fierce
---
and
suddenly
said
,
---
  
<EOS>
"
What
do
those
persons
deserve
who
have
compassed
my
destruction
;
I
being
the
King
's
lawful
,
as
well
as
natural
,
protector
?
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
To
this
strange
question
,
Lord
Hastings
replied
,
that
they
deserved
death
,
whosoever
they
were
.
  
<EOS>
"
Then
,
"
said
the
Duke
,
"
I
tell
you
that
they
are
that
sorceress
my
brother
's
wife
;
"
meaning
the
Queen
:
 
"
and
that
other
sorceress
,
Jane
Shore
.
 
<EOS>
Who
,
by
witchcraft
,
have
withered
my
body
,
and
caused
my
arm
to
shrink
as
I
now
show
you
.
"
  
<EOS>
He
then
pulled
up
his
sleeve
and
showed
them
his
arm
,
which
was
shrunken
,
it
is
true
,
but
which
had
been
so
,
as
they
all
very
well
knew
,
from
the
hour
of
his
birth
.
  
<EOS>
Jane
Shore
,
being
then
the
lover
of
Lord
Hastings
,
as
she
had
formerly
been
of
the
late
King
,
that
lord
knew
that
he
himself
was
attacked
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
said
,
in
some
confusion
,
"
Certainly
,
my
Lord
,
if
they
have
done
this
,
they
be
worthy
of
punishment
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
If
?
"
said
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
;
"
do
you
talk
to
me
of
ifs
?
 
<EOS>
I
tell
you
that
they
HAVE
so
done
,
and
I
will
make
it
good
upon
thy
body
,
thou
traitor
!
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
struck
the
table
a
great
blow
with
his
fist
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
signal
to
some
of
his
people
outside
to
cry
"
Treason
!
"
 
<EOS>
They
immediately
did
so
,
and
there
was
a
rush
into
the
chamber
of
so
many
armed
men
that
it
was
filled
in
a
moment
.
  
<EOS>
"
First
,
"
said
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
to
Lord
Hastings
,
"
I
arrest
thee
,
traitor
!
 
<EOS>
And
let
him
,
"
he
added
to
the
armed
men
who
took
him
,
"
have
a
priest
at
once
,
for
by
St
Paul
<EOS>
I
will
not
dine
until
I
have
seen
his
head
of
!
"
  
<EOS>
Lord
Hastings
was
hurried
to
the
green
by
the
Tower
chapel
,
and
there
beheaded
on
a
log
of
wood
that
happened
to
be
lying
on
the
ground
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
the
Duke
dined
with
a
good
appetite
,
and
after
dinner
summoning
the
principal
citizens
to
attend
him
,
told
them
that
Lord
Hastings
and
the
rest
had
designed
to
murder
both
himself
and
the
Duke
if
Buckingham
,
who
stood
by
his
side
,
if
he
had
not
providentially
discovered
their
design
.
 
<EOS>
He
requested
them
to
be
so
obliging
as
to
inform
their
fellow
-
citizens
of
the
truth
of
what
he
said
,
and
issued
a
proclamation
(
prepared
and
neatly
copied
out
beforehand
)
to
the
same
effect
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
same
day
that
the
Duke
did
these
things
in
the
Tower
,
Sir
Richard
Ratcliffe
,
the
boldest
and
most
undaunted
of
his
men
,
went
down
to
Pontefract
;
arrested
Lord
Rivers
,
Lord
Gray
,
and
two
other
gentlemen
;
and
publicly
executed
them
on
the
scaffold
,
without
any
trial
,
for
having
intended
the
Duke
's
death
.
 
<EOS>
Three
days
afterwards
the
Duke
,
not
to
lose
time
,
went
down
the
river
to
Westminster
in
his
barge
,
attended
by
divers
bishops
,
lords
,
and
soldiers
,
and
demanded
that
the
Queen
should
deliver
her
second
son
,
the
Duke
of
York
,
into
his
safe
keeping
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
,
being
obliged
to
comply
,
resigned
the
child
after
she
had
wept
over
him
;
and
Richard
of
Gloucester
placed
him
with
his
brother
in
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
seized
Jane
Shore
,
and
,
because
she
had
been
the
lover
of
the
late
King
,
confiscated
her
property
,
and
got
her
sentenced
to
do
public
penance
in
the
streets
by
walking
in
a
scanty
dress
,
with
bare
feet
,
and
carrying
a
lighted
candle
,
to
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
through
the
most
crowded
part
of
the
City
.
  
<EOS>
Having
now
all
things
ready
for
his
own
advancement
,
he
caused
a
friar
to
preach
a
sermon
at
the
cross
which
stood
in
front
of
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
in
which
he
dwelt
upon
the
profligate
manners
of
the
late
King
,
and
upon
the
late
shame
of
Jane
Shore
,
and
hinted
that
the
princes
were
not
his
children
.
 
<EOS>
"
Whereas
,
good
people
,
"
said
the
friar
,
whose
name
was
SHAW
,
"
my
Lord
the
Protector
,
the
noble
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
that
sweet
prince
,
the
pattern
of
all
the
noblest
virtues
,
is
the
perfect
image
and
express
likeness
of
his
father
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
little
plot
between
the
Duke
and
the
friar
,
that
the
Duke
should
appear
in
the
crowd
at
this
moment
,
when
it
was
expected
that
the
people
would
cry
"
Long
live
King
Richard
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
either
through
the
friar
saying
the
words
too
soon
,
or
through
the
Duke
's
coming
too
late
,
the
Duke
and
the
words
did
not
come
together
,
and
the
people
only
laughed
,
and
the
friar
sneaked
off
ashamed
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Buckingham
was
a
better
hand
at
such
business
than
the
friar
,
so
he
went
to
the
Guildhall
the
next
day
,
and
addressed
the
citizens
in
the
Lord
Protector
's
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
dirty
men
,
who
had
been
hired
and
stationed
there
for
the
purpose
,
crying
when
he
had
done
,
"
God
save
King
Richard
!
"
<EOS>
he
made
them
a
great
bow
,
and
thanked
them
with
all
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
to
make
an
end
of
it
,
he
went
with
the
mayor
and
some
lords
and
citizens
to
Bayard
Castle
,
by
the
river
,
where
Richard
then
was
,
and
read
an
address
,
humbly
entreating
him
to
accept
the
Crown
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
,
who
looked
down
upon
them
out
of
a
window
and
pretended
to
be
in
great
uneasiness
and
alarm
,
assured
them
there
was
nothing
he
desired
less
,
and
that
his
deep
affection
for
his
nephews
forbade
him
to
think
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
replied
,
with
pretended
warmth
,
that
the
free
people
of
England
would
never
submit
to
his
nephew
's
rule
,
and
that
if
Richard
,
who
was
the
lawful
heir
,
refused
the
Crown
,
why
then
they
must
find
some
one
else
to
wear
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Gloucester
returned
,
that
since
he
used
that
strong
language
,
it
became
his
painful
duty
to
think
no
more
of
himself
,
and
to
accept
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
the
people
cheered
and
dispersed
;
and
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
and
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
passed
a
pleasant
evening
,
talking
over
the
play
they
had
just
acted
with
so
much
success
,
and
every
word
of
which
they
had
prepared
together
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Richard
<EOS>
the
Third
    
KING
RICHARD
<EOS>
THE
THIRD
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
,
and
went
to
Westminster
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
Hall
was
a
marble
seat
,
upon
which
he
sat
himself
down
between
two
great
noblemen
,
and
told
the
people
that
he
began
the
new
reign
in
that
place
,
because
the
first
duty
of
a
sovereign
was
to
administer
the
laws
equally
to
all
,
and
to
maintain
justice
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
mounted
his
horse
and
rode
back
to
the
City
,
where
he
was
received
by
the
clergy
and
the
crowd
as
if
he
really
had
a
right
to
the
throne
,
and
really
were
a
just
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
clergy
and
the
crowd
must
have
been
rather
ashamed
of
themselves
in
secret
,
I
think
,
for
being
such
poor
-
spirited
knaves
.
  
<EOS>
The
new
King
and
his
Queen
were
soon
crowned
with
a
great
deal
of
show
and
noise
,
which
the
people
liked
very
much
;
and
then
the
King
set
forth
on
a
royal
progress
through
his
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
crowned
a
second
time
at
York
,
in
order
that
the
people
might
have
show
and
noise
enough
;
and
wherever
he
went
was
received
with
shouts
of
rejoicing
---
from
a
good
many
people
of
strong
lungs
,
who
were
paid
to
strain
their
throats
in
crying
,
"
God
save
King
Richard
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
plan
was
so
successful
that
I
am
told
it
has
been
imitated
since
,
by
other
usurpers
,
in
other
progresses
through
other
dominions
.
  
<EOS>
While
he
was
on
this
journey
,
King
Richard
stayed
a
week
at
Warwick
.
 
<EOS>
And
from
Warwick
he
sent
instructions
home
for
one
of
the
wickedest
murders
that
ever
was
done
---
the
murder
of
the
two
young
princes
,
his
nephews
,
who
were
shut
up
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Robert
Brackenbury
was
at
that
time
Governor
of
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
To
him
,
by
the
hands
of
a
messenger
named
JOHN
GREEN
,
did
King
Richard
send
a
letter
,
ordering
him
by
some
means
to
put
the
two
young
princes
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
But
Sir
Robert
---
I
hope
because
he
had
children
of
his
own
,
and
loved
them
---
sent
John
Green
back
again
,
riding
and
spurring
along
the
dusty
roads
,
with
the
answer
that
he
could
not
do
so
horrible
a
piece
of
work
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
having
frowningly
considered
a
little
,
called
to
him
SIR
JAMES
TYRREL
,
his
master
of
the
horse
,
and
to
him
gave
authority
to
take
command
of
the
Tower
,
<EOS>
whenever
he
would
,
for
twenty
-
four
hours
,
and
to
keep
all
the
keys
of
the
Tower
during
that
space
of
time
.
 
<EOS>
Tyrrel
,
well
knowing
what
was
wanted
,
looked
about
him
for
two
hardened
ruffians
,
and
chose
JOHN
DIGHTON
,
one
of
his
own
grooms
,
and
MILES
FOREST
,
who
was
a
murderer
by
trade
.
 
<EOS>
Having
secured
these
two
assistants
,
he
went
,
upon
a
day
in
August
,
to
the
Tower
,
showed
his
authority
from
the
King
,
took
the
command
for
four
-
and
-
twenty
hours
,
and
obtained
possession
of
the
keys
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
black
night
came
he
went
creeping
,
creeping
,
like
a
guilty
villain
as
he
was
,
up
<EOS>
the
dark
,
stone
winding
stairs
,
and
along
the
dark
stone
passages
,
until
he
came
to
the
door
of
the
room
where
the
two
young
princes
,
having
said
their
prayers
,
lay
fast
asleep
,
clasped
in
each
other
's
arms
.
<EOS>
And
while
he
watched
and
listened
at
the
door
,
he
sent
in
those
evil
demons
,
John
Dighton
and
Miles
Forest
,
who
smothered
the
two
princes
with
the
bed
and
pillows
,
and
carried
their
bodies
down
the
stairs
,
and
buried
them
under
a
great
heap
of
stones
at
the
staircase
foot
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
day
came
,
he
gave
up
the
command
of
the
Tower
,
and
restored
the
keys
,
and
hurried
away
without
once
looking
behind
him
;
and
Sir
Robert
Brackenbury
went
with
fear
and
sadness
to
the
princes
"
room
,
and
found
the
princes
gone
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
You
know
,
through
all
this
history
,
how
true
it
is
that
traitors
are
never
true
,
and
you
will
not
be
surprised
to
learn
that
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
soon
turned
against
King
Richard
,
and
joined
a
great
conspiracy
that
was
formed
to
dethrone
him
,
and
to
place
the
crown
upon
its
rightful
owner
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
had
meant
to
keep
the
murder
secret
;
but
when
he
heard
through
his
spies
that
this
conspiracy
existed
,
and
that
many
lords
and
gentlemen
drank
in
secret
to
the
healths
of
the
two
young
princes
in
the
Tower
,
he
made
it
known
that
they
were
dead
.
 
<EOS>
The
conspirators
,
though
thwarted
for
a
moment
,
soon
resolved
to
set
up
for
the
crown
against
the
murderous
Richard
,
HENRY
Earl
of
Richmond
,
grandson
of
Catherine
:
 
that
widow
of
Henry
the
Fifth
who
married
Owen
Tudor
.
<EOS>
And
as
Henry
was
of
the
house
of
Lancaster
,
they
proposed
that
he
should
marry
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
the
eldest
daughter
of
the
late
King
,
now
the
heiress
of
the
house
of
York
,
and
thus
by
uniting
the
rival
families
put
an
end
to
the
fatal
wars
of
the
Red
and
White
Roses
.
 
<EOS>
All
being
settled
,
a
time
was
appointed
for
Henry
to
come
over
from
Brittany
,
and
for
a
great
rising
against
Richard
to
take
place
in
several
parts
of
England
at
the
same
hour
.
 
<EOS>
On
a
certain
day
,
therefore
,
in
October
,
the
revolt
took
place
;
but
unsuccessfully
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
was
prepared
,
Henry
was
driven
back
at
sea
by
a
storm
,
his
followers
in
England
were
dispersed
,
and
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
was
taken
,
and
at
once
beheaded
in
the
market
-
place
at
Salisbury
.
  
<EOS>
The
time
of
his
success
was
a
good
time
,
Richard
thought
,
for
summoning
a
Parliament
and
getting
some
money
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
a
Parliament
was
called
,
and
it
flattered
and
fawned
upon
him
as
much
as
he
could
possibly
desire
,
and
declared
him
to
be
the
rightful
King
of
England
,
and
his
only
son
Edward
,
then
eleven
years
of
age
,
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
.
  
<EOS>
Richard
knew
full
well
that
,
let
the
Parliament
say
what
it
would
,
the
Princess
Elizabeth
was
remembered
by
people
as
the
heiress
of
the
house
of
York
;
and
having
accurate
information
besides
,
of
its
being
designed
by
the
conspirators
to
marry
her
to
Henry
of
Richmond
,
he
felt
that
it
would
much
strengthen
him
and
weaken
them
,
to
be
beforehand
with
them
,
and
marry
her
to
his
son
.
 
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
went
to
the
Sanctuary
at
Westminster
,
where
the
late
King
's
widow
and
her
daughter
still
were
,
and
besought
them
to
come
to
Court
:
 
<EOS>
where
(
he
swore
by
anything
and
everything
)
<EOS>
they
should
be
safely
and
honourably
entertained
.
 
<EOS>
They
came
,
accordingly
,
but
had
scarcely
been
at
Court
a
month
when
his
son
died
suddenly
---
or
was
poisoned
---
and
his
plan
was
crushed
to
pieces
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
extremity
,
King
Richard
,
always
active
,
thought
,
"
I
must
make
another
plan
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
made
the
plan
of
marrying
the
Princess
Elizabeth
himself
,
although
she
was
his
niece
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
one
difficulty
in
the
way
:
 
his
wife
,
the
Queen
Anne
,
was
alive
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
knew
(
remembering
his
nephews
)
how
to
remove
that
obstacle
,
and
he
made
love
to
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
telling
her
he
felt
perfectly
confident
that
the
Queen
would
die
in
February
.
 
<EOS>
The
Princess
was
not
a
very
scrupulous
young
lady
,
for
,
instead
of
rejecting
the
murderer
of
her
brothers
with
scorn
and
hatred
,
she
openly
declared
she
loved
him
dearly
;
and
,
when
February
came
and
the
Queen
did
not
die
,
she
expressed
her
impatient
opinion
that
she
was
too
long
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
King
Richard
was
not
so
far
out
in
his
prediction
,
but
,
that
she
died
in
March
---
he
took
good
care
of
that
---
and
then
this
precious
pair
hoped
to
be
married
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
disappointed
,
for
the
idea
of
such
a
marriage
<EOS>
was
so
unpopular
in
the
country
,
that
the
King
's
chief
counsellors
,
RATCLIFFE
and
CATESBY
,
would
by
no
means
undertake
to
propose
it
,
and
the
King
was
even
obliged
to
declare
in
public
that
he
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
,
by
this
time
,
dreaded
and
hated
by
all
classes
of
his
subjects
.
 
<EOS>
His
nobles
deserted
every
day
to
Henry
's
side
;
he
dared
not
call
another
Parliament
,
lest
his
crimes
should
be
denounced
there
;
and
for
want
of
money
,
he
was
obliged
to
get
Benevolences
from
the
citizens
,
which
exasperated
them
all
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
said
too
,
that
,
being
stricken
by
his
conscience
,
he
dreamed
frightful
dreams
,
and
started
up
in
the
night
-
time
,
wild
with
terror
and
remorse
.
 
<EOS>
Active
to
the
last
,
through
all
this
,
he
issued
vigorous
proclamations
against
Henry
of
Richmond
and
all
his
followers
,
when
he
heard
that
they
were
coming
against
him
with
a
Fleet
from
France
;
and
took
the
field
as
fierce
and
savage
as
a
wild
boar
---
the
animal
represented
on
his
shield
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
of
Richmond
landed
with
six
thousand
men
at
Milford
Haven
,
and
came
on
against
King
Richard
,
then
encamped
at
Leicester
with
an
army
twice
as
great
,
through
North
Wales
.
 
<EOS>
On
Bosworth
Field
the
two
armies
met
;
and
Richard
,
looking
along
Henry
's
ranks
,
and
seeing
them
crowded
with
the
English
nobles
who
had
abandoned
him
,
turned
pale
when
he
beheld
the
powerful
Lord
Stanley
and
his
son
(
whom
he
had
tried
hard
to
retain
)
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
as
brave
as
he
was
wicked
,
and
plunged
into
the
thickest
of
the
fight
.
<EOS>
He
was
riding
hither
and
thither
,
laying
about
him
in
all
directions
,
when
he
observed
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
---
one
of
his
few
great
allies
---
to
stand
inactive
,
and
the
main
body
of
his
troops
to
hesitate
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
moment
,
his
desperate
glance
caught
Henry
of
Richmond
among
a
little
group
of
his
knights
.
<EOS>
Riding
hard
at
him
,
and
crying
"
Treason
!
"
<EOS>
he
killed
his
standard
-
bearer
,
fiercely
unhorsed
another
gentleman
,
and
aimed
a
powerful
stroke
at
Henry
himself
,
to
cut
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Sir
William
Stanley
parried
it
as
it
fell
,
and
before
Richard
could
raise
his
arm
again
,
he
was
borne
down
in
a
press
of
numbers
,
unhorsed
,
and
killed
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Stanley
picked
up
the
crown
,
all
bruised
and
trampled
,
and
stained
with
blood
,
and
put
it
upon
Richmond
's
head
,
amid
loud
and
rejoicing
cries
of
"
Long
live
King
Henry
!
"
  
<EOS>
That
night
,
a
horse
was
led
up
to
the
church
of
the
Grey
Friars
at
Leicester
;
across
whose
back
was
tied
,
like
some
worthless
sack
,
a
naked
body
brought
there
for
burial
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
the
body
of
the
last
of
the
Plantagenet
line
,
King
Richard
the
Third
,
usurper
and
murderer
,
slain
at
the
battle
of
Bosworth
Field
in
the
thirty
-
second
year
of
his
age
,
after
a
reign
of
two
years
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Seventh
    
KING
HENRY
<EOS>
THE
SEVENTH
did
not
turn
out
to
be
as
fine
a
fellow
as
the
nobility
and
people
hoped
,
in
the
first
joy
of
their
deliverance
from
Richard
the
Third
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
cold
,
crafty
,
and
calculating
,
and
would
do
almost
anything
for
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
possessed
considerable
ability
,
but
his
chief
merit
appears
to
have
been
that
he
was
not
cruel
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
new
King
had
promised
the
nobles
who
had
espoused
his
cause
that
he
would
marry
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
thing
he
did
,
was
,
to
direct
her
to
be
removed
from
the
castle
of
Sheriff
Hutton
in
Yorkshire
,
where
Richard
had
placed
her
,
and
restored
to
the
care
of
her
mother
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
Earl
of
Warwick
,
Edward
Plantagenet
,
son
and
heir
of
the
late
Duke
of
Clarence
,
had
been
kept
a
prisoner
in
the
same
old
Yorkshire
Castle
with
her
.
<EOS>
This
boy
,
who
was
now
fifteen
,
the
new
King
placed
in
the
Tower
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
came
to
London
in
great
state
,
and
gratified
the
people
with
a
fine
procession
;
on
which
kind
of
show
he
often
very
much
relied
for
keeping
them
in
good
humour
.
 
<EOS>
The
sports
and
feasts
which
took
place
were
followed
by
a
terrible
fever
,
called
the
Sweating
Sickness
;
of
which
great
numbers
of
people
died
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Mayors
and
Aldermen
are
thought
to
have
suffered
most
from
it
;
whether
,
because
they
were
in
the
habit
of
over
-
eating
themselves
,
or
because
they
were
very
jealous
of
preserving
filth
and
nuisances
in
the
City
(
as
they
have
been
since
)
,
I
do
n't
know
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
's
coronation
was
postponed
on
account
of
the
general
ill
-
health
,
and
he
afterwards
deferred
his
marriage
,
as
if
he
were
not
very
anxious
that
it
should
take
place
:
 
and
,
even
after
that
,
deferred
the
Queen
's
coronation
so
long
that
he
gave
offence
to
the
York
party
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
he
set
these
things
right
in
the
end
,
by
hanging
some
men
and
seizing
on
the
rich
possessions
of
others
;
by
granting
more
popular
pardons
to
the
followers
of
the
late
King
than
could
,
at
first
,
be
got
from
him
;
and
,
by
employing
about
his
Court
,
some
very
scrupulous
persons
who
had
been
employed
in
the
previous
reign
.
  
<EOS>
As
this
reign
was
principally
remarkable
for
two
very
curious
impostures
which
have
become
famous
in
history
,
we
will
make
those
two
stories
its
principal
feature
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
priest
at
Oxford
of
the
name
of
Simons
,
who
had
for
a
pupil
a
handsome
boy
named
Lambert
Simnel
,
the
son
of
a
baker
.
<EOS>
Partly
to
gratify
his
own
ambitious
ends
,
and
partly
to
carry
out
the
designs
of
a
secret
party
formed
against
the
King
,
this
priest
declared
that
his
pupil
,
the
boy
,
was
no
other
than
the
young
Earl
of
Warwick
;
who
(
as
everybody
might
have
known
)
was
safely
locked
up
in
the
Tower
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
priest
and
the
boy
went
over
to
Ireland
;
and
,
at
Dublin
,
enlisted
in
their
cause
all
ranks
of
the
people
:
 
who
seem
to
have
been
generous
enough
,
but
exceedingly
irrational
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Kildare
,
the
governor
of
Ireland
,
declared
that
he
believed
the
boy
to
be
what
the
priest
represented
;
and
the
boy
,
who
had
been
well
tutored
by
the
priest
,
told
them
such
things
of
his
childhood
,
and
gave
them
so
many
descriptions
of
the
Royal
Family
,
that
they
were
perpetually
shouting
and
hurrahing
,
and
drinking
his
health
,
and
making
all
kinds
of
noisy
and
thirsty
demonstrations
,
to
express
their
belief
in
him
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
feeling
confined
to
Ireland
alone
,
for
the
Earl
of
Lincoln
---
whom
the
late
usurper
had
named
as
his
successor
<EOS>
---
went
over
to
the
young
Pretender
;
and
,
after
holding
a
secret
correspondence
with
the
Dowager
Duchess
of
Burgundy
---
the
sister
of
Edward
the
Fourth
,
who
detested
the
present
King
and
all
his
race
---
sailed
to
Dublin
with
two
thousand
German
soldiers
of
her
providing
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
promising
state
of
the
boy
's
fortunes
,
he
was
crowned
there
,
with
a
crown
taken
off
the
head
of
a
statue
of
the
Virgin
Mary
;
and
was
then
,
according
to
the
Irish
custom
of
those
days
,
carried
home
on
the
shoulders
of
a
big
chieftain
possessing
a
great
deal
more
strength
than
sense
.
 
<EOS>
Father
Simons
,
you
may
be
sure
,
was
mighty
busy
at
the
coronation
.
  
<EOS>
Ten
days
afterwards
,
the
Germans
,
and
the
Irish
,
and
the
priest
,
and
the
boy
,
and
the
Earl
of
Lincoln
,
all
landed
in
Lancashire
to
invade
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
had
good
intelligence
of
their
movements
,
set
up
his
standard
at
Nottingham
,
where
vast
numbers
resorted
to
him
every
day
;
while
the
Earl
of
Lincoln
could
gain
but
very
few
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
small
force
he
tried
to
make
for
the
town
of
Newark
;
but
the
King
's
army
getting
between
him
and
that
place
,
he
had
no
choice
but
to
risk
a
battle
at
Stoke
.
 
<EOS>
It
soon
ended
in
the
complete
destruction
of
the
Pretender
's
forces
,
one
half
of
whom
were
killed
;
among
them
,
the
Earl
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
priest
and
the
baker
's
boy
were
taken
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
The
priest
,
after
confessing
the
trick
,
was
shut
up
in
prison
,
where
he
afterwards
died
---
suddenly
perhaps
.
 
<EOS>
The
boy
was
taken
into
the
King
's
kitchen
and
made
a
turnspit
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
afterwards
raised
to
the
station
of
one
of
the
King
's
falconers
;
and
so
ended
this
strange
imposition
.
  
<EOS>
There
seems
reason
to
suspect
that
the
Dowager
Queen
---
always
a
restless
and
busy
woman
---
had
had
some
share
in
tutoring
the
baker
's
son
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
very
angry
with
her
,
whether
or
no
.
 
<EOS>
He
seized
upon
her
property
,
and
shut
her
up
in
a
convent
at
Bermondsey
.
  
<EOS>
One
might
suppose
that
the
end
of
this
story
would
have
put
the
Irish
people
on
their
guard
;
but
they
were
quite
ready
to
receive
a
second
impostor
,
as
they
had
received
the
first
,
and
that
same
troublesome
Duchess
of
Burgundy
soon
gave
them
the
opportunity
.
<EOS>
All
of
a
sudden
there
appeared
at
Cork
,
in
a
vessel
arriving
from
Portugal
,
a
young
man
of
excellent
abilities
,
of
very
handsome
appearance
and
most
winning
manners
,
who
declared
himself
to
be
Richard
,
Duke
of
York
,
the
second
son
of
King
Edward
the
Fourth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
,
"
said
some
,
even
of
those
ready
Irish
believers
,
"
but
surely
that
young
Prince
was
murdered
by
his
uncle
in
the
Tower
!
"
<EOS>
---
"
It
IS
supposed
so
,
"
said
the
engaging
young
man
;
"
and
my
brother
WAS
killed
in
that
gloomy
prison
;
but
I
escaped
---
it
do
n't
matter
how
,
at
present
---
and
have
been
wandering
about
the
world
for
seven
long
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
This
explanation
being
quite
satisfactory
to
numbers
of
the
Irish
people
,
they
began
again
to
shout
and
to
hurrah
,
and
to
drink
his
health
,
and
to
make
the
noisy
and
thirsty
demonstrations
all
over
again
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
big
chieftain
in
Dublin
began
to
look
out
for
another
coronation
,
and
another
young
King
to
be
carried
home
on
his
back
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
King
Henry
being
then
on
bad
terms
with
France
,
the
French
King
,
Charles
the
Eighth
,
saw
that
,
by
pretending
to
believe
in
the
handsome
young
man
,
he
could
trouble
his
enemy
sorely
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
invited
him
over
to
the
French
Court
,
and
appointed
him
a
body
-
guard
,
and
treated
him
in
all
respects
as
if
he
really
were
the
Duke
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
Peace
,
however
,
being
soon
concluded
between
the
two
Kings
,
the
pretended
Duke
was
turned
adrift
,
and
wandered
for
protection
to
the
Duchess
of
Burgundy
.
 
<EOS>
She
,
after
feigning
to
inquire
into
the
reality
of
his
claims
,
declared
him
to
be
the
very
picture
of
her
dear
departed
brother
;
gave
him
a
body
-
guard
at
her
Court
,
of
thirty
halberdiers
;
and
called
him
by
the
sounding
name
of
the
White
Rose
of
England
.
  
<EOS>
The
leading
members
of
the
White
Rose
party
in
England
sent
over
an
agent
,
named
Sir
Robert
Clifford
,
to
ascertain
whether
the
White
Rose
's
claims
were
good
:
 
<EOS>
the
King
also
sent
over
his
agents
to
inquire
into
the
Rose
's
history
.
 
<EOS>
The
White
Roses
declared
the
young
man
to
be
really
the
Duke
of
York
;
the
King
declared
him
to
be
PERKIN
WARBECK
,
the
son
of
a
merchant
of
the
city
of
Tournay
,
who
had
acquired
his
knowledge
of
England
,
its
language
and
manners
,
from
the
English
merchants
who
traded
in
Flanders
;
it
was
also
stated
by
the
Royal
agents
that
he
had
been
in
the
service
of
Lady
Brompton
,
the
wife
of
an
exiled
English
nobleman
,
and
that
the
Duchess
of
Burgundy
had
caused
him
to
be
trained
and
taught
,
expressly
for
this
deception
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
then
required
the
Archduke
Philip
---
who
was
the
sovereign
of
Burgundy
---
to
banish
this
new
Pretender
,
or
to
deliver
him
up
;
but
,
as
the
Archduke
replied
that
he
could
not
control
the
Duchess
in
her
own
land
,
the
King
,
in
revenge
,
took
the
market
of
English
cloth
away
from
Antwerp
,
and
prevented
all
commercial
intercourse
between
the
two
countries
.
  
<EOS>
He
also
,
by
arts
and
bribes
,
prevailed
on
Sir
Robert
Clifford
to
betray
his
employers
;
and
he
denouncing
several
famous
English
noblemen
as
being
secretly
the
friends
of
Perkin
Warbeck
,
the
King
had
three
of
the
foremost
executed
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
pardoned
the
remainder
because
they
were
poor
,
I
do
not
know
;
but
it
is
only
too
probable
that
he
refused
to
pardon
one
famous
nobleman
against
whom
the
same
Clifford
soon
afterwards
informed
separately
,
because
he
was
rich
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
no
other
than
Sir
William
Stanley
,
who
had
saved
the
King
's
life
at
the
battle
of
Bosworth
Field
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
very
doubtful
whether
his
treason
amounted
to
much
more
than
his
having
said
,
that
if
he
were
sure
the
young
man
was
the
Duke
of
York
,
he
would
not
take
arms
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
Whatever
he
had
done
he
admitted
,
like
an
honourable
spirit
;
and
he
lost
his
head
for
it
,
and
the
covetous
King
gained
all
his
wealth
.
  
<EOS>
Perkin
Warbeck
kept
quiet
for
three
years
;
but
,
as
the
Flemings
began
to
complain
heavily
of
the
loss
of
their
trade
by
the
stoppage
of
the
Antwerp
market
on
his
account
,
and
as
it
was
not
unlikely
that
they
might
even
go
so
far
as
to
take
his
life
,
or
give
him
up
,
he
found
it
necessary
to
do
something
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
he
made
a
desperate
sally
,
and
landed
,
with
only
a
few
hundred
men
,
on
the
coast
of
Deal
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
soon
glad
to
get
back
to
the
place
from
whence
<EOS>
he
came
;
for
the
country
people
rose
against
his
followers
,
killed
a
great
many
,
and
took
a
hundred
and
fifty
prisoners
:
 
who
were
all
driven
to
London
,
tied
together
with
ropes
,
like
a
team
of
cattle
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
of
them
was
hanged
on
some
part
or
other
of
the
sea
-
shore
;
in
order
,
that
if
any
more
men
should
come
over
with
Perkin
Warbeck
,
they
might
see
the
bodies
as
a
warning
before
they
landed
.
  
<EOS>
Then
the
wary
King
,
by
making
a
treaty
of
commerce
with
the
Flemings
,
drove
Perkin
Warbeck
out
of
that
country
;
and
,
by
completely
gaining
over
the
Irish
to
his
side
,
deprived
him
of
that
asylum
too
.
 
<EOS>
He
wandered
away
to
Scotland
,
and
told
his
story
at
that
Court
.
 
<EOS>
King
James
the
Fourth
of
Scotland
,
who
was
no
friend
to
King
Henry
,
and
had
no
reason
to
be
(
for
King
Henry
had
bribed
his
Scotch
lords
to
betray
him
more
than
once
;
but
had
never
succeeded
in
his
plots
)
,
gave
him
a
great
reception
,
called
him
his
cousin
,
and
gave
him
in
marriage
the
Lady
Catherine
Gordon
,
a
beautiful
and
charming
creature
related
to
the
royal
house
of
Stuart
.
  
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
this
successful
reappearance
of
the
Pretender
,
the
King
still
undermined
,
and
bought
,
and
bribed
,
and
kept
his
doings
and
Perkin
Warbeck
's
story
in
the
dark
,
when
he
might
,
one
would
imagine
,
have
rendered
the
matter
clear
to
all
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
for
all
this
bribing
of
the
Scotch
lords
at
the
Scotch
King
's
Court
,
he
could
not
procure
the
Pretender
to
be
delivered
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
James
,
though
not
very
particular
in
many
respects
,
would
not
betray
him
;
and
the
ever
-
busy
Duchess
of
Burgundy
so
provided
him
with
arms
,
and
good
soldiers
,
and
with
money
besides
,
that
he
had
soon
a
little
army
of
fifteen
hundred
men
of
various
nations
.
 
<EOS>
With
these
,
and
aided
by
the
Scottish
King
in
person
,
he
crossed
the
border
into
England
,
and
made
a
proclamation
to
the
people
,
in
which
he
called
the
King
"
Henry
Tudor
;
"
offered
large
rewards
to
any
who
should
take
or
distress
him
;
and
announced
himself
as
King
Richard
the
Fourth
come
to
receive
the
homage
of
his
faithful
subjects
.
<EOS>
His
faithful
subjects
,
however
,
cared
nothing
for
him
,
and
hated
his
faithful
troops
:
 
who
,
being
of
different
nations
,
quarrelled
also
among
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
Worse
than
this
,
if
worse
were
possible
,
they
began
to
plunder
the
country
;
upon
which
the
White
Rose
said
,
that
he
would
rather
lose
his
rights
,
than
gain
them
through
the
miseries
of
the
English
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
King
made
a
jest
of
his
scruples
;
but
they
and
their
whole
force
went
back
again
without
fighting
a
battle
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
consequence
of
this
attempt
was
,
that
a
rising
took
place
among
the
people
of
Cornwall
,
who
considered
themselves
too
heavily
taxed
to
meet
the
charges
of
the
expected
war
.
 
<EOS>
Stimulated
by
Flammock
,
a
lawyer
,
and
Joseph
,
a
blacksmith
,
and
joined
by
Lord
Audley
and
some
other
country
gentlemen
,
they
marched
on
all
the
way
to
Deptford
Bridge
,
where
they
fought
a
battle
with
the
King
's
army
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
defeated
---
though
the
Cornish
men
fought
with
great
bravery
---
and
the
lord
was
beheaded
,
and
the
lawyer
and
the
blacksmith
were
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
were
pardoned
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
believed
every
man
to
be
as
avaricious
as
himself
,
and
thought
that
money
could
settle
anything
,
allowed
them
to
make
bargains
for
their
liberty
with
the
soldiers
who
had
taken
them
.
  
<EOS>
Perkin
Warbeck
,
doomed
to
wander
up
and
down
,
and
never
to
find
rest
anywhere
---
a
sad
fate
:
 
almost
a
sufficient
punishment
for
an
imposture
,
which
he
seems
in
time
to
have
half
believed
himself
---
lost
his
Scottish
refuge
through
a
truce
being
made
between
the
two
Kings
;
and
found
himself
,
once
more
,
without
a
country
before
him
in
which
he
could
lay
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
But
James
(
always
honourable
and
true
to
him
,
alike
when
he
melted
down
his
plate
,
and
even
the
great
gold
chain
he
had
been
used
to
wear
,
to
pay
soldiers
in
his
cause
;
and
now
,
when
that
cause
was
lost
and
hopeless
)
did
not
conclude
the
treaty
,
until
he
had
safely
departed
out
of
the
Scottish
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
and
his
beautiful
wife
,
who
was
faithful
to
him
under
all
reverses
,
and
left
her
state
and
home
to
follow
his
poor
fortunes
,
were
put
aboard
ship
with
everything
necessary
for
their
comfort
and
protection
,
and
sailed
for
Ireland
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
the
Irish
people
had
had
enough
of
counterfeit
Earls
of
Warwick
and
Dukes
of
York
,
for
one
while
;
and
would
give
the
White
Rose
no
aid
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
White
Rose
---
encircled
by
thorns
indeed
---
resolved
to
go
with
his
beautiful
wife
to
Cornwall
as
a
forlorn
resource
,
and
see
what
might
be
made
of
the
Cornish
men
,
who
had
risen
so
valiantly
a
little
while
before
,
and
who
had
fought
so
bravely
at
Deptford
Bridge
.
  
<EOS>
To
Whitsand
Bay
,
in
Cornwall
,
accordingly
,
came
Perkin
Warbeck
and
his
wife
;
and
the
lovely
lady
he
shut
up
for
safety
in
the
Castle
of
St
Michael
's
Mount
,
and
then
marched
into
Devonshire
at
the
head
of
three
thousand
Cornishmen
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
increased
to
six
thousand
by
the
time
of
his
arrival
in
Exeter
;
but
,
there
the
people
made
a
stout
resistance
,
and
he
went
on
to
Taunton
,
where
he
came
in
sight
of
the
King
's
army
.
 
<EOS>
The
stout
Cornish
men
,
although
they
were
few
in
number
,
and
badly
armed
,
were
so
bold
,
that
they
never
thought
of
retreating
;
but
bravely
looked
forward
to
a
battle
on
the
morrow
.
 
<EOS>
Unhappily
for
them
,
the
man
who
was
possessed
of
so
many
engaging
qualities
,
and
who
attracted
so
many
people
to
his
side
when
he
had
nothing
else
with
which
to
tempt
them
,
was
not
as
brave
as
they
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
night
,
when
the
two
armies
lay
opposite
to
each
other
,
he
mounted
a
swift
horse
and
fled
.
 
<EOS>
When
morning
dawned
,
the
poor
confiding
Cornish
men
,
discovering
that
they
had
no
leader
,
surrendered
to
the
King
's
power
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
them
were
hanged
,
and
the
rest
were
pardoned
and
went
miserably
home
.
  
<EOS>
Before
the
King
pursued
Perkin
Warbeck
to
the
sanctuary
of
Beaulieu
in
the
New
Forest
,
where
it
was
soon
known
that
he
had
taken
refuge
,
he
sent
a
body
of
horsemen
to
St
Michael
's
Mount
,
to
seize
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
soon
taken
and
brought
as
a
captive
before
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
was
so
beautiful
,
and
so
good
,
and
so
devoted
to
the
man
in
whom
she
believed
,
that
the
King
regarded
her
with
compassion
,
treated
her
with
great
respect
,
and
placed
her
at
Court
,
near
the
Queen
's
person
.
 
<EOS>
And
many
years
after
Perkin
Warbeck
was
no
more
,
and
when
his
strange
story
had
become
like
a
nursery
tale
,
SHE
was
called
the
White
Rose
,
by
the
people
,
in
remembrance
of
her
beauty
.
  
<EOS>
The
sanctuary
at
Beaulieu
was
soon
surrounded
by
the
King
's
men
;
and
the
King
,
pursuing
his
usual
dark
,
artful
ways
,
sent
pretended
friends
to
Perkin
Warbeck
to
persuade
him
to
come
out
and
surrender
himself
.
 
<EOS>
This
he
soon
did
;
the
King
having
taken
a
good
look
at
the
man
of
whom
he
had
heard
so
much
---
from
behind
a
screen
---
directed
him
to
be
well
mounted
,
and
to
ride
behind
him
at
a
little
distance
,
guarded
,
but
not
bound
in
any
way
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
entered
London
with
the
King
's
favourite
show
---
a
procession
;
and
some
of
the
people
hooted
as
the
Pretender
rode
slowly
through
the
streets
to
the
Tower
;
but
the
greater
part
were
quiet
,
and
very
curious
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
From
the
Tower
,
he
was
taken
to
the
Palace
at
Westminster
,
and
there
lodged
like
a
gentleman
,
though
closely
watched
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
examined
every
now
and
then
as
to
his
imposture
;
but
the
King
was
so
secret
in
all
he
did
,
that
even
then
he
gave
it
a
consequence
,
which
it
can
not
be
supposed
to
have
in
itself
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
Perkin
Warbeck
ran
away
,
and
took
refuge
in
another
sanctuary
near
Richmond
in
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
From
this
he
was
again
persuaded
to
deliver
himself
up
;
and
,
being
conveyed
to
London
,
he
stood
in
the
stocks
for
a
whole
day
,
outside
Westminster
Hall
,
and
there
read
a
paper
purporting
to
be
his
full
confession
,
and
relating
his
history
as
the
King
's
agents
had
originally
described
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
then
shut
up
in
the
Tower
again
,
in
the
company
of
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
who
had
now
been
there
for
fourteen
years
:
 
ever
since
his
removal
out
of
Yorkshire
,
except
when
the
King
had
had
him
at
Court
,
and
had
shown
him
to
the
people
,
to
prove
the
imposture
of
the
Baker
's
boy
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
but
too
probable
,
when
we
consider
the
crafty
character
of
Henry
the
Seventh
,
that
these
two
were
brought
together
for
a
cruel
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
A
plot
was
soon
discovered
between
them
and
the
keepers
,
to
murder
the
Governor
,
get
possession
of
the
keys
,
and
proclaim
Perkin
Warbeck
as
King
Richard
the
Fourth
.
 
<EOS>
That
there
was
some
such
plot
,
is
likely
;
that
they
were
tempted
into
it
,
<EOS>
is
at
least
as
likely
;
that
the
unfortunate
Earl
of
Warwick
---
last
male
of
the
Plantagenet
line
---
was
too
unused
to
the
world
,
and
too
ignorant
and
simple
to
know
much
about
it
,
whatever
it
was
,
is
perfectly
certain
;
and
that
it
was
the
King
's
interest
to
get
rid
of
him
,
is
no
less
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
beheaded
on
Tower
Hill
,
and
Perkin
Warbeck
was
hanged
at
Tyburn
.
  
<EOS>
Such
was
the
end
of
the
pretended
Duke
of
York
,
whose
shadowy
history
was
made
more
shadowy
---
and
ever
will
be
---
by
the
mystery
and
craft
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
turned
his
great
natural
advantages
to
a
more
honest
account
,
he
might
have
lived
a
happy
and
respected
life
,
even
in
those
days
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
died
upon
a
gallows
at
Tyburn
,
leaving
the
Scottish
lady
,
who
had
loved
him
so
well
,
kindly
protected
at
the
Queen
's
Court
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
time
she
forgot
her
old
loves
and
troubles
,
as
many
people
do
with
Time
's
merciful
assistance
,
and
married
a
Welsh
gentleman
.
 
<EOS>
Her
second
husband
,
SIR
MATTHEW
CRADOC
,
more
honest
and
more
happy
than
her
first
,
lies
beside
her
in
a
tomb
in
the
old
church
of
Swansea
.
  
<EOS>
The
ill
-
blood
between
France
and
England
in
this
reign
,
arose
out
of
the
continued
plotting
of
the
Duchess
of
Burgundy
,
and
disputes
respecting
the
affairs
of
Brittany
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
feigned
to
be
very
patriotic
,
indignant
,
and
warlike
;
but
he
always
contrived
so
as
never
to
make
war
in
reality
,
and
always
to
make
money
.
 
<EOS>
His
taxation
of
the
people
,
on
pretence
of
war
with
France
,
involved
,
at
one
time
,
a
very
dangerous
insurrection
,
headed
by
Sir
John
Egremont
,
and
a
common
man
called
John
a
Chambre
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
was
subdued
by
the
royal
forces
,
under
the
command
of
the
Earl
of
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
The
knighted
John
escaped
to
the
Duchess
of
Burgundy
,
who
was
ever
ready
to
receive
any
one
who
gave
the
King
trouble
;
and
the
plain
John
was
hanged
at
York
,
in
the
midst
of
a
number
of
his
men
,
but
on
a
much
higher
gibbet
,
as
being
a
greater
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
Hung
high
or
hung
low
,
however
,
hanging
is
much
the
same
to
the
person
hung
.
  
<EOS>
Within
a
year
after
her
marriage
,
the
Queen
had
given
birth
to
a
son
,
who
was
called
Prince
Arthur
,
in
remembrance
of
the
old
British
prince
of
romance
and
story
;
and
who
,
when
all
these
events
had
happened
,
being
then
in
his
fifteenth
year
,
was
married
to
CATHERINE
,
the
daughter
of
the
Spanish
monarch
,
with
great
rejoicings
and
bright
prospects
;
but
in
a
very
few
months
he
sickened
and
died
.
 
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
King
had
recovered
from
his
grief
,
he
thought
it
a
pity
that
the
fortune
of
the
Spanish
Princess
,
amounting
to
two
hundred
thousand
crowns
,
should
go
out
of
the
family
;
and
therefore
arranged
that
the
young
widow
should
marry
his
second
son
HENRY
,
then
twelve
years
of
age
,
when
he
too
should
be
fifteen
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
objections
to
this
marriage
on
the
part
of
the
clergy
;
but
,
as
the
infallible
Pope
was
gained
over
,
and
,
as
he
MUST
be
right
,
that
settled
the
business
for
the
time
.
<EOS>
The
King
's
eldest
daughter
was
provided
for
,
and
a
long
course
of
disturbance
was
considered
to
be
set
at
rest
,
by
her
being
married
to
the
Scottish
King
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
Queen
died
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
King
had
got
over
that
grief
too
,
his
mind
once
more
reverted
to
his
darling
money
for
consolation
,
and
he
thought
of
marrying
the
Dowager
Queen
of
Naples
,
who
was
immensely
rich
:
 
<EOS>
but
,
as
it
turned
out
not
to
be
practicable
to
gain
the
money
however
practicable
it
might
have
been
to
gain
the
lady
,
he
gave
up
the
idea
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
fond
of
her
but
that
he
soon
proposed
to
marry
the
Dowager
Duchess
of
Savoy
;
and
,
soon
afterwards
,
the
widow
of
the
King
of
Castile
,
who
was
raving
mad
.
<EOS>
But
he
made
a
money
-
bargain
instead
,
and
married
neither
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duchess
of
Burgundy
,
among
the
other
discontented
people
to
whom
she
had
given
refuge
,
had
sheltered
EDMUND
DE
LA
POLE
(
younger
brother
of
that
Earl
of
Lincoln
who
was
killed
at
Stoke
)
,
now
Earl
of
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
had
prevailed
upon
him
to
return
to
the
marriage
of
Prince
Arthur
;
but
,
he
soon
afterwards
went
away
again
;
and
then
the
King
,
suspecting
a
conspiracy
,
resorted
to
his
favourite
plan
of
sending
him
some
treacherous
friends
,
and
buying
of
those
scoundrels
the
secrets
they
disclosed
or
invented
.
 
<EOS>
Some
arrests
and
executions
took
place
in
consequence
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
end
,
the
King
,
on
a
promise
of
not
taking
his
life
,
obtained
possession
of
the
person
of
Edmund
de
la
Pole
,
and
shut
him
up
in
the
Tower
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
his
last
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
had
lived
much
longer
he
would
have
made
many
more
among
the
people
,
by
the
grinding
exaction
to
which
he
constantly
exposed
them
,
and
by
the
tyrannical
acts
of
his
two
prime
favourites
in
all
money
-
raising
matters
,
EDMUND
DUDLEY
and
RICHARD
EMPSON
.
 
<EOS>
But
Death
---
the
enemy
who
is
not
to
be
bought
off
or
deceived
,
and
on
whom
no
money
,
and
no
treachery
has
any
effect
---
presented
himself
at
this
juncture
,
and
ended
the
King
's
reign
.
<EOS>
He
died
of
the
gout
,
on
the
twenty
-
second
of
April
,
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
nine
,
and
in
the
fifty
-
third
year
of
his
age
,
after
reigning
twenty
-
four
years
;
he
was
buried
in
the
beautiful
Chapel
of
Westminster
Abbey
,
which
he
had
himself
founded
,
and
which
still
bears
his
name
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
this
reign
that
the
great
CHRISTOPHER
COLUMBUS
,
on
behalf
of
Spain
,
discovered
what
was
then
called
The
New
World
.
 
<EOS>
Great
wonder
,
interest
,
and
hope
of
wealth
being
awakened
in
England
<EOS>
thereby
,
the
King
and
the
merchants
of
London
and
Bristol
fitted
out
an
English
expedition
for
further
discoveries
in
the
New
World
,
and
entrusted
it
to
SEBASTIAN
CABOT
,
of
Bristol
,
the
son
of
a
Venetian
pilot
there
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
successful
in
his
voyage
,
and
gained
high
reputation
,
both
for
himself
and
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry

Called

<EOS>
the
First
    
WE
now
come
to
King
Henry
the
Eighth
,
whom
it
has
been
too
much
the
fashion
to
call
"
Bluff
King
Hal
,
"
and
"
Burly
King
Harry
,
"
and
other
fine
names
;
but
whom
<EOS>
I
shall
take
the
liberty
to
call
,
plainly
,
one
of
the
most
detestable
villains
that
ever
drew
breath
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
be
able
to
judge
,
long
before
we
come
to
the
end
of
his
life
,
whether
he
deserves
the
character
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
just
eighteen
years
of
age
when
he
came
to
the
throne
.
<EOS>
People
said
he
was
handsome
then
;
but
I
do
n't
believe
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
big
,
burly
,
noisy
,
small
-
eyed
,
large
-
faced
,
double
-
chinned
,
swinish
-
looking
fellow
in
later
life
(
as
we
know
from
the
likenesses
of
him
,
painted
by
the
famous
HANS
HOLBEIN
)
,
and
it
is
not
easy
to
believe
that
so
bad
a
character
can
ever
have
been
veiled
under
a
prepossessing
appearance
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
anxious
to
make
himself
popular
;
and
the
people
,
who
had
long
disliked
the
late
King
,
were
very
willing
to
believe
that
he
deserved
to
be
so
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
extremely
fond
of
show
and
display
,
and
so
were
they
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
there
was
great
rejoicing
when
he
married
the
Princess
Catherine
,
and
when
they
were
both
crowned
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
King
fought
at
tournaments
and
always
came
off
victorious
---
for
the
courtiers
took
care
of
that
---
and
there
was
a
general
outcry
that
he
was
a
wonderful
man
.
 
<EOS>
Empson
,
Dudley
,
and
their
supporters
were
accused
of
a
variety
of
crimes
they
had
never
committed
,
instead
of
the
offences
of
which
they
really
had
been
guilty
;
and
they
were
pilloried
,
and
set
upon
horses
with
their
faces
to
the
tails
,
and
knocked
about
and
beheaded
,
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
,
and
the
enrichment
of
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
The
Pope
,
so
indefatigable
in
getting
the
world
into
trouble
,
had
mixed
himself
up
in
a
war
on
the
continent
of
Europe
,
occasioned
by
the
reigning
Princes
of
little
quarrelling
states
in
Italy
<EOS>
having
at
various
times
married
into
other
Royal
families
,
and
so
led
to
THEIR
claiming
a
share
in
those
petty
Governments
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
discovered
that
he
was
very
fond
of
the
Pope
,
sent
a
herald
to
the
King
of
France
,
to
say
that
he
must
not
make
war
upon
that
holy
personage
,
because
he
was
the
father
of
all
Christians
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
French
King
did
not
mind
this
relationship
in
the
least
,
and
also
refused
to
admit
a
claim
King
Henry
made
to
certain
lands
in
France
,
war
was
declared
between
the
two
countries
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
perplex
this
story
with
an
account
of
the
tricks
and
designs
of
all
the
sovereigns
who
were
engaged
in
it
,
it
is
enough
to
say
that
England
made
a
blundering
alliance
with
Spain
,
and
got
stupidly
taken
in
by
that
country
;
which
made
its
own
terms
with
France
when
it
could
and
left
England
in
the
lurch
.
 
<EOS>
SIR
EDWARD
HOWARD
,
a
bold
admiral
,
son
of
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
distinguished
himself
by
his
bravery
against
the
French
in
this
business
;
but
,
unfortunately
,
he
was
more
brave
than
wise
,
for
,
skimming
into
the
French
harbour
of
Brest
with
only
a
few
row
-
boats
<EOS>
,
he
attempted
(
in
revenge
for
the
defeat
and
death
of
SIR
THOMAS
KNYVETT
,
another
bold
English
admiral
)
to
take
some
strong
French
ships
,
well
defended
with
batteries
of
cannon
.
 
<EOS>
The
upshot
was
,
that
he
was
left
on
board
of
one
of
them
(
in
consequence
of
its
shooting
away
from
his
own
boat
)
,
with
not
more
than
about
a
dozen
men
,
and
was
thrown
into
the
sea
and
drowned
:
 
though
not
until
he
had
taken
from
his
breast
his
gold
chain
and
gold
whistle
,
which
were
the
signs
of
his
office
,
and
had
cast
them
into
the
sea
to
prevent
their
being
made
a
boast
of
by
the
enemy
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
defeat
---
which
was
a
great
one
,
for
Sir
Edward
Howard
was
a
man
of
valour
and
fame
---
the
King
took
it
into
his
head
to
invade
France
in
person
;
first
executing
that
dangerous
Earl
of
Suffolk
whom
his
father
had
left
in
the
Tower
,
and
appointing
Queen
Catherine
to
the
charge
of
his
kingdom
in
his
absence
.
 
<EOS>
He
sailed
to
Calais
,
where
he
was
joined
by
MAXIMILIAN
,
Emperor
of
Germany
,
who
pretended
to
be
his
soldier
,
and
who
took
pay
in
his
service
:
 
with
a
good
deal
of
nonsense
of
that
sort
,
flattering
enough
to
the
vanity
of
a
vain
blusterer
.
<EOS>
The
King
might
be
successful
enough
in
sham
fights
;
but
his
idea
of
real
battles
chiefly
consisted
in
pitching
silken
tents
of
bright
colours
that
were
ignominiously
blown
down
by
the
wind
,
and
in
making
a
vast
display
of
gaudy
flags
and
golden
curtains
.
 
<EOS>
Fortune
,
however
,
favoured
him
better
than
he
deserved
;
for
,
after
much
waste
of
time
in
tent
pitching
,
flag
flying
,
gold
curtaining
,
and
other
such
masquerading
,
he
gave
the
French
battle
at
a
place
called
Guinegate
:
 
where
they
took
such
an
unaccountable
panic
,
and
fled
with
such
swiftness
,
that
it
was
ever
afterwards
called
by
the
English
the
Battle
of
Spurs
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
following
up
his
advantage
,
the
King
,
finding
that
he
had
had
enough
of
real
fighting
,
came
home
again
.
  
<EOS>
The
Scottish
King
,
though
nearly
related
to
Henry
by
marriage
,
had
taken
part
against
him
in
this
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Surrey
,
as
the
English
general
,
advanced
to
meet
him
when
he
came
out
of
his
own
dominions
and
crossed
the
river
Tweed
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
armies
came
up
with
one
another
when
the
Scottish
King
had
also
crossed
the
river
Till
,
and
was
encamped
upon
the
last
of
the
Cheviot
Hills
,
called
the
Hill
of
Flodden
.
 
<EOS>
Along
the
plain
below
it
,
the
English
,
when
the
hour
of
battle
came
,
advanced
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
army
,
which
had
been
drawn
up
in
five
great
bodies
,
then
came
steadily
down
in
perfect
silence
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
,
in
their
turn
,
advanced
to
meet
the
English
army
,
which
came
on
in
one
long
line
;
and
they
attacked
it
with
a
body
of
spearmen
,
under
LORD
HOME
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
they
had
the
best
of
it
;
but
the
English
recovered
themselves
so
bravely
,
and
fought
with
such
valour
,
that
,
when
the
Scottish
King
had
almost
made
his
way
up
to
the
Royal
Standard
,
he
was
slain
,
and
the
whole
Scottish
power
routed
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
thousand
Scottish
men
lay
dead
that
day
on
Flodden
Field
;
and
among
them
,
numbers
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
.
<EOS>
For
a
long
time
afterwards
,
the
Scottish
peasantry
used
to
believe
that
their
King
had
not
been
really
killed
in
this
battle
,
because
no
Englishman
had
found
an
iron
belt
he
wore
about
his
body
as
a
penance
for
having
been
an
unnatural
and
undutiful
son
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whatever
became
of
his
belt
,
the
English
had
his
sword
and
dagger
,
and
the
ring
from
his
finger
,
and
his
body
too
,
covered
with
wounds
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
of
it
;
for
it
was
seen
and
recognised
by
English
gentlemen
who
had
known
the
Scottish
King
well
.
  
<EOS>
When
King
Henry
was
making
ready
to
renew
the
war
in
France
,
the
French
King
was
contemplating
peace
.
 
<EOS>
His
queen
,
dying
at
this
time
,
he
proposed
,
though
he
was
upwards
of
fifty
years
old
,
to
marry
King
Henry
's
sister
,
the
Princess
Mary
,
who
,
besides
being
only
sixteen
,
was
betrothed
to
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
inclinations
of
young
Princesses
were
not
much
considered
in
such
matters
,
the
marriage
was
concluded
,
and
the
poor
girl
was
escorted
to
France
,
where
she
was
immediately
left
as
the
French
King
's
bride
,
with
only
one
of
all
her
English
attendants
.
 
<EOS>
That
one
was
a
pretty
young
girl
named
ANNE
BOLEYN
,
niece
of
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
who
had
been
made
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
after
the
victory
of
Flodden
Field
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
's
is
a
name
to
be
remembered
,
as
you
will
presently
find
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
the
French
King
,
who
was
very
proud
of
his
young
wife
,
was
preparing
for
many
years
of
happiness
,
and
she
was
looking
forward
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
to
many
years
of
misery
,
when
he
died
within
three
months
,
and
left
her
a
young
widow
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
French
monarch
,
FRANCIS
THE
FIRST
,
seeing
how
important
it
was
to
his
interests
that
she
should
take
for
her
second
husband
no
one
but
an
Englishman
<EOS>
,
advised
her
first
lover
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
when
King
Henry
sent
him
over
to
France
to
fetch
her
home
,
to
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
The
Princess
being
herself
so
fond
of
that
Duke
,
as
to
tell
him
that
he
must
either
do
so
then
,
or
for
ever
lose
her
,
they
were
wedded
;
and
Henry
afterwards
forgave
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
making
interest
with
the
King
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
had
addressed
his
most
powerful
favourite
and
adviser
,
THOMAS
WOLSEY
---
a
name
very
famous
in
history
for
its
rise
and
downfall
.
  
<EOS>
Wolsey
was
the
son
of
a
respectable
butcher
at
Ipswich
,
in
Suffolk
and
received
so
excellent
an
education
that
he
became
a
tutor
to
the
family
of
the
Marquis
of
Dorset
,
who
afterwards
got
him
appointed
one
of
the
late
King
's
chaplains
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
accession
of
Henry
the
Eighth
,
he
was
promoted
and
taken
into
great
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
Archbishop
of
York
;
the
Pope
had
made
him
a
Cardinal
besides
;
and
whoever
wanted
influence
in
England
or
favour
with
the
King
---
whether
he
were
a
foreign
monarch
or
an
English
nobleman
---
was
obliged
to
make
a
friend
of
the
great
Cardinal
Wolsey
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
gay
man
,
who
could
dance
and
jest
,
and
sing
and
drink
;
and
those
were
the
roads
to
so
much
,
or
rather
so
little
,
of
a
heart
as
King
Henry
had
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
wonderfully
fond
of
pomp
and
glitter
,
and
so
was
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
knew
a
good
deal
of
the
Church
learning
of
that
time
;
much
of
which
consisted
in
finding
artful
excuses
and
pretences
for
almost
any
wrong
thing
,
and
in
arguing
that
black
was
white
,
or
any
other
colour
.
 
<EOS>
This
kind
of
learning
pleased
the
King
too
.
 
<EOS>
For
many
such
reasons
,
the
Cardinal
was
high
in
estimation
with
the
King
;
and
,
being
a
man
of
far
greater
ability
,
knew
as
well
how
to
manage
him
,
as
a
clever
keeper
may
know
how
to
manage
a
wolf
or
a
tiger
,
or
any
other
cruel
and
uncertain
beast
<EOS>
,
that
may
turn
upon
him
and
tear
him
any
day
.
 
<EOS>
Never
had
there
been
seen
in
England
<EOS>
such
state
as
my
Lord
Cardinal
kept
.
 
<EOS>
His
wealth
was
enormous
;
equal
,
it
was
reckoned
,
to
the
riches
of
the
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
His
palaces
were
as
splendid
as
the
King
's
,
and
his
retinue
was
eight
hundred
strong
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
his
Court
,
dressed
out
from
top
to
toe
in
flaming
scarlet
;
and
his
very
shoes
were
golden
,
set
with
precious
stones
.
 
<EOS>
His
followers
rode
on
blood
horses
;
while
he
,
with
a
wonderful
affectation
of
humility
in
the
midst
of
his
great
splendour
,
ambled
on
a
mule
with
a
red
velvet
saddle
and
bridle
and
golden
stirrups
.
  
<EOS>
Through
the
influence
of
this
stately
priest
,
a
grand
meeting
was
arranged
to
take
place
between
the
French
and
English
Kings
in
France
;
but
on
ground
belonging
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
A
prodigious
show
of
friendship
and
rejoicing
was
to
be
made
on
the
occasion
;
and
heralds
were
sent
to
proclaim
with
brazen
trumpets
through
all
the
principal
cities
of
Europe
,
that
,
on
a
certain
day
,
the
Kings
of
France
and
England
,
as
companions
and
brothers
in
arms
,
each
attended
by
eighteen
followers
,
would
hold
a
tournament
against
all
knights
who
might
choose
to
come
.
  
<EOS>
CHARLES
,
the
new
Emperor
of
Germany
(
the
old
one
being
dead
)
,
wanted
to
prevent
too
cordial
an
alliance
between
these
sovereigns
,
and
came
over
to
England
before
the
King
could
repair
to
the
place
of
meeting
;
and
,
besides
making
an
agreeable
impression
upon
him
,
secured
Wolsey
's
interest
by
promising
that
his
influence
should
make
him
Pope
when
the
next
vacancy
occurred
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
day
when
the
Emperor
left
England
,
the
King
and
all
the
Court
went
over
to
Calais
,
and
thence
to
the
place
of
meeting
,
between
Ardres
and
Guisnes
,
commonly
called
the
Field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
all
manner
of
expense
and
prodigality
was
lavished
on
the
decorations
of
the
show
;
many
of
the
knights
and
gentlemen
being
so
superbly
dressed
that
it
was
said
they
carried
their
whole
estates
upon
their
shoulders
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
sham
castles
,
temporary
chapels
,
fountains
running
wine
,
great
cellars
full
of
wine
free
as
water
to
all
comers
,
silk
tents
,
gold
lace
and
foil
,
gilt
lions
,
and
such
things
without
end
;
and
,
in
the
midst
of
all
,
the
rich
Cardinal
out
-
shone
and
out
-
glittered
all
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
treaty
made
between
the
two
Kings
with
as
much
solemnity
as
if
they
had
intended
to
keep
it
,
the
lists
---
nine
hundred
feet
long
,
and
three
hundred
and
twenty
broad
---
were
opened
for
the
tournament
;
the
Queens
of
France
and
England
looking
on
with
great
array
of
lords
and
ladies
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
for
ten
days
,
the
two
sovereigns
fought
five
combats
every
day
,
and
always
beat
their
polite
adversaries
;
though
they
DO
write
that
the
King
of
England
,
being
thrown
in
a
wrestle
one
day
by
the
King
of
France
,
lost
his
kingly
temper
with
his
brother
-
in
-
arms
,
and
wanted
to
make
a
quarrel
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
there
is
a
great
story
belonging
to
this
Field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
,
showing
how
the
English
were
distrustful
of
the
French
,
and
the
French
of
the
English
,
until
Francis
rode
alone
one
morning
to
Henry
's
tent
;
and
,
going
in
before
he
was
out
of
bed
,
told
him
in
joke
that
he
was
his
prisoner
;
and
how
Henry
jumped
out
of
bed
and
embraced
Francis
;
and
how
Francis
helped
Henry
to
dress
,
and
warmed
his
linen
for
him
;
and
how
Henry
gave
Francis
a
splendid
jewelled
collar
,
and
how
Francis
gave
Henry
,
in
return
,
a
costly
bracelet
.
<EOS>
All
this
and
a
great
deal
more
was
so
written
about
,
and
sung
about
,
and
talked
about
at
that
time
(
and
,
indeed
,
since
that
time
too
)
,
that
the
world
has
had
good
cause
to
be
sick
of
it
,
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
nothing
came
of
all
these
fine
doings
but
a
speedy
renewal
of
the
war
between
England
and
France
,
in
which
the
two
Royal
companions
and
brothers
in
arms
longed
very
earnestly
to
damage
one
another
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
before
it
broke
out
again
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
was
shamefully
executed
on
Tower
Hill
,
on
the
evidence
of
a
discharged
servant
---
really
for
nothing
,
except
the
folly
of
having
believed
in
a
friar
of
the
name
of
HOPKINS
,
who
had
pretended
to
be
a
prophet
,
and
who
had
mumbled
and
jumbled
out
some
nonsense
about
the
Duke
's
son
being
destined
to
be
very
great
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
believed
that
the
unfortunate
Duke
had
given
offence
to
the
great
Cardinal
by
expressing
his
mind
freely
about
the
expense
and
absurdity
of
the
whole
business
of
the
Field
of
the
Cloth
of
Gold
.
 
<EOS>
At
any
rate
,
he
was
beheaded
,
as
I
have
said
,
for
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
And
the
people
who
saw
it
done
were
very
angry
,
and
cried
out
that
it
was
the
work
of
"
the
butcher
's
son
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
new
war
was
a
short
one
,
though
the
Earl
of
Surrey
invaded
France
again
,
and
did
some
injury
to
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
It
ended
in
another
treaty
of
peace
between
the
two
kingdoms
,
and
in
the
discovery
that
the
Emperor
of
Germany
was
not
such
a
good
friend
to
England
in
reality
,
as
he
pretended
to
be
.
 
<EOS>
Neither
did
he
keep
his
promise
to
Wolsey
to
make
him
Pope
,
though
the
King
urged
him
.
 
<EOS>
Two
Popes
died
in
pretty
quick
succession
;
but
the
foreign
priests
were
too
much
for
the
Cardinal
,
and
kept
him
out
of
the
post
.
 
<EOS>
So
the
Cardinal
and
King
together
found
out
that
the
Emperor
of
Germany
was
not
a
man
to
keep
faith
with
;
broke
off
a
projected
marriage
between
the
King
's
daughter
MARY
,
Princess
of
Wales
,
and
that
sovereign
;
and
began
to
consider
whether
it
might
not
be
well
to
marry
the
young
lady
,
either
to
Francis
himself
,
or
to
his
eldest
son
.
  
<EOS>
There
now
arose
at
Wittemberg
,
in
Germany
,
the
great
leader
of
the
mighty
change
in
England
which
is
called
The
Reformation
,
and
which
set
the
people
free
from
their
slavery
to
the
priests
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
a
learned
Doctor
,
named
MARTIN
LUTHER
,
who
knew
all
about
them
,
for
he
had
been
a
priest
,
and
even
a
monk
,
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
preaching
and
writing
of
Wickliffe
had
set
a
number
of
men
thinking
on
this
subject
;
and
Luther
,
finding
one
day
to
his
great
surprise
,
that
there
really
was
a
book
called
the
New
Testament
which
the
priests
did
not
allow
to
be
read
,
and
which
contained
truths
that
they
suppressed
,
began
to
be
very
vigorous
against
the
whole
body
,
from
the
Pope
downward
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
,
while
he
was
yet
only
beginning
his
vast
work
of
awakening
the
nation
,
that
an
impudent
fellow
named
TETZEL
,
a
friar
of
very
bad
character
,
came
into
his
neighbourhood
selling
what
were
called
Indulgences
,
by
wholesale
,
to
raise
money
for
beautifying
the
great
Cathedral
of
St
Peter
's
,
at
Rome
.
 
<EOS>
Whoever
bought
an
Indulgence
of
the
Pope
was
supposed
to
buy
himself
off
from
the
punishment
of
Heaven
for
his
offences
.
<EOS>
Luther
told
the
people
that
these
Indulgences
were
worthless
bits
of
paper
,
before
God
,
and
that
Tetzel
and
his
masters
were
a
crew
of
impostors
in
selling
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
and
the
Cardinal
were
mightily
indignant
at
this
presumption
;
and
the
King
(
with
the
help
of
SIR
THOMAS
MORE
,
a
wise
man
,
whom
he
afterwards
repaid
by
striking
off
his
head
)
even
wrote
a
book
about
it
,
with
which
the
Pope
was
so
well
pleased
that
he
gave
the
King
the
title
of
Defender
of
the
Faith
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
and
the
Cardinal
also
issued
flaming
warnings
to
the
people
not
to
read
Luther
's
books
,
on
pain
of
excommunication
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
did
read
them
for
all
that
;
and
the
rumour
of
what
was
in
them
spread
far
and
wide
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
great
change
was
thus
going
on
,
the
King
began
to
show
himself
in
his
truest
and
worst
colours
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
Boleyn
,
the
pretty
little
girl
who
had
gone
abroad
to
France
with
his
sister
,
was
by
this
time
grown
up
to
be
very
beautiful
,
and
was
one
of
the
ladies
in
attendance
on
Queen
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
Queen
Catherine
was
no
longer
young
or
handsome
,
and
it
is
likely
that
she
was
not
particularly
good
-
tempered
;
having
been
always
rather
melancholy
,
and
having
been
made
more
so
by
the
deaths
of
four
of
her
children
when
they
were
very
young
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
King
fell
in
love
with
the
fair
Anne
Boleyn
,
and
said
to
himself
,
"
How
can
I
be
best
rid
of
my
own
troublesome
wife
whom
I
am
tired
of
,
and
marry
Anne
?
"
  
<EOS>
You
recollect
that
Queen
Catherine
had
been
the
wife
of
Henry
's
brother
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
the
King
do
,
after
thinking
it
over
,
but
calls
his
favourite
priests
about
him
,
and
says
,
O
!
<EOS>
his
mind
is
in
such
a
dreadful
state
,
and
he
is
so
frightfully
uneasy
,
because
he
is
afraid
it
was
not
lawful
for
him
to
marry
the
Queen
!
 
<EOS>
Not
one
of
those
priests
had
the
courage
to
hint
that
it
was
rather
curious
he
had
never
thought
of
that
before
,
and
that
his
mind
seemed
to
have
been
in
a
tolerably
jolly
condition
during
a
great
many
years
,
in
which
he
certainly
had
not
fretted
himself
thin
;
but
,
they
all
said
,
Ah
!
<EOS>
that
was
very
true
,
and
it
was
a
serious
business
;
and
perhaps
the
best
way
to
make
it
right
,
would
be
for
his
Majesty
to
be
divorced
!
 
<EOS>
The
King
replied
,
Yes
,
he
thought
that
would
be
the
best
way
,
certainly
;
so
they
all
went
to
work
.
  
<EOS>
If
I
were
to
relate
to
you
the
intrigues
and
plots
that
took
place
in
the
endeavour
to
get
this
divorce
,
you
would
think
the
History
of
England
the
most
tiresome
book
in
the
world
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
shall
say
no
more
,
than
that
after
a
vast
deal
of
negotiation
and
evasion
,
the
Pope
issued
a
commission
to
Cardinal
Wolsey
and
CARDINAL
CAMPEGGIO
(
whom
he
sent
over
from
Italy
for
the
purpose
)
,
to
try
the
whole
case
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
supposed
---
and
I
think
with
reason
---
that
Wolsey
was
the
Queen
's
enemy
,
because
she
had
reproved
him
for
his
proud
and
gorgeous
manner
of
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
did
not
at
first
know
that
the
King
wanted
to
marry
Anne
Boleyn
;
and
when
he
did
know
it
,
he
even
went
down
on
his
knees
,
in
the
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
Cardinals
opened
their
court
in
the
Convent
of
the
Black
Friars
,
near
to
where
the
bridge
of
that
name
in
London
now
stands
;
and
the
King
and
Queen
,
that
they
might
be
near
it
,
took
up
their
lodgings
at
the
adjoining
palace
of
Bridewell
,
of
which
nothing
now
remains
but
a
bad
prison
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
opening
of
the
court
,
when
the
King
and
Queen
were
called
on
to
appear
,
that
poor
ill
-
used
lady
,
with
a
dignity
and
firmness
and
yet
with
a
womanly
affection
worthy
to
be
always
admired
,
went
and
kneeled
at
the
King
's
feet
,
and
said
that
she
had
come
,
a
stranger
,
to
his
dominions
;
that
she
had
been
a
good
and
true
wife
to
him
for
twenty
years
;
and
that
she
could
acknowledge
no
power
in
those
Cardinals
to
try
whether
she
should
be
considered
his
wife
after
all
that
time
,
or
should
be
put
away
.
<EOS>
With
that
,
she
got
up
and
left
the
court
,
and
would
never
afterwards
come
back
to
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
pretended
to
be
very
much
overcome
,
and
said
,
O
!
<EOS>
my
lords
and
gentlemen
,
what
a
good
woman
she
was
to
be
sure
,
and
how
delighted
he
would
be
to
live
with
her
unto
death
,
but
for
that
terrible
uneasiness
in
his
mind
which
was
quite
wearing
him
away
!
<EOS>
So
,
the
case
went
on
,
and
there
was
nothing
but
talk
for
two
months
.
 
<EOS>
Then
Cardinal
Campeggio
,
who
,
on
behalf
of
the
Pope
,
wanted
nothing
so
much
as
delay
,
adjourned
it
for
two
more
months
;
and
before
that
time
was
elapsed
,
the
Pope
himself
adjourned
it
indefinitely
,
by
requiring
the
King
and
Queen
to
come
to
Rome
and
have
it
tried
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
by
good
luck
for
the
King
,
word
was
brought
to
him
by
some
of
his
people
,
that
they
had
happened
to
meet
at
supper
,
THOMAS
CRANMER
,
a
learned
Doctor
of
Cambridge
,
who
had
proposed
to
urge
the
Pope
on
,
by
referring
the
case
to
all
the
learned
doctors
and
bishops
,
here
and
there
and
everywhere
,
and
getting
their
opinions
that
the
King
's
marriage
was
unlawful
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
was
now
in
a
hurry
to
marry
Anne
Boleyn
,
thought
this
such
a
good
idea
,
that
he
sent
for
Cranmer
,
post
haste
,
and
said
to
LORD
ROCHFORT
,
Anne
Boleyn
's
father
,
"
Take
this
learned
Doctor
down
to
your
country
-
house
,
and
there
let
him
have
a
good
room
for
a
study
,
and
no
end
of
books
out
of
which
to
prove
that
I
may
marry
your
daughter
.
"
 
<EOS>
Lord
Rochfort
,
not
at
all
reluctant
,
made
the
learned
Doctor
as
comfortable
as
he
could
;
and
the
learned
Doctor
went
to
work
to
prove
his
case
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
King
and
Anne
Boleyn
were
writing
letters
to
one
another
almost
daily
,
full
of
impatience
to
have
the
case
settled
;
and
Anne
Boleyn
was
showing
herself
(
as
I
think
)
very
worthy
of
the
fate
which
afterwards
befel
her
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
bad
for
Cardinal
Wolsey
that
he
had
left
Cranmer
to
render
this
help
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
worse
for
him
that
he
had
tried
to
dissuade
the
King
from
marrying
Anne
Boleyn
.
 
<EOS>
Such
a
servant
as
he
,
to
such
a
master
as
Henry
,
would
probably
have
fallen
in
any
case
;
but
,
between
the
hatred
of
the
party
of
the
Queen
that
was
,
and
the
hatred
of
the
party
of
the
Queen
that
was
to
be
,
he
fell
suddenly
and
heavily
.
 
<EOS>
Going
down
one
day
to
the
Court
of
Chancery
,
where
he
now
presided
,
he
was
waited
upon
by
the
Dukes
of
Norfolk
and
Suffolk
,
who
told
him
that
they
brought
an
order
to
him
to
resign
that
office
,
and
to
withdraw
quietly
to
a
house
he
had
at
Esher
,
in
Surrey
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cardinal
refusing
,
they
rode
off
to
the
King
;
and
next
day
came
back
with
a
letter
from
him
,
on
reading
which
,
the
Cardinal
submitted
.
 
<EOS>
An
inventory
was
made
out
of
all
the
riches
in
his
palace
at
York
Place
(
now
Whitehall
)
,
and
he
went
sorrowfully
up
the
river
,
in
his
barge
,
to
Putney
.
 
<EOS>
An
abject
man
he
was
,
in
spite
of
his
pride
;
for
being
overtaken
,
riding
out
of
that
place
towards
Esher
,
by
one
of
the
King
's
chamberlains
who
brought
him
a
kind
message
and
a
ring
,
he
alighted
from
his
mule
,
took
off
his
cap
,
and
kneeled
down
in
the
dirt
.
 
<EOS>
His
poor
Fool
,
whom
in
his
prosperous
days
he
had
always
kept
in
his
palace
to
entertain
him
,
cut
a
far
better
figure
than
he
;
for
,
when
the
Cardinal
said
to
the
chamberlain
that
he
had
nothing
to
send
to
his
lord
the
King
as
a
present
,
but
that
jester
who
was
a
most
excellent
one
,
it
took
six
strong
yeomen
to
remove
the
faithful
fool
from
his
master
.
  
<EOS>
The
once
proud
Cardinal
was
soon
further
disgraced
,
and
wrote
the
most
abject
letters
to
his
vile
sovereign
;
who
humbled
him
one
day
and
encouraged
him
the
next
,
according
to
his
humour
,
until
he
was
at
last
ordered
to
go
and
reside
in
his
diocese
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
was
too
poor
;
but
I
do
n't
know
how
he
made
that
out
,
for
he
took
a
hundred
and
sixty
servants
with
him
,
and
seventy
-
two
cart
-
loads
of
furniture
,
food
,
and
wine
.
 
<EOS>
He
remained
in
that
part
of
the
country
for
the
best
part
of
a
year
,
and
showed
himself
so
improved
by
his
misfortunes
,
and
was
so
mild
and
so
conciliating
,
that
he
won
all
hearts
.
 
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
even
in
his
proud
days
,
he
had
done
some
magnificent
things
for
learning
and
education
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
was
arrested
for
high
treason
;
and
,
coming
slowly
on
his
journey
towards
London
,
got
as
far
as
Leicester
.
 
<EOS>
Arriving
at
Leicester
Abbey
after
dark
,
and
very
ill
,
he
said
---
when
the
monks
came
out
at
the
gate
with
lighted
torches
to
receive
him
---
that
he
had
come
to
lay
his
bones
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
indeed
;
for
he
was
taken
to
a
bed
,
from
which
he
never
rose
again
.
 
<EOS>
His
last
words
were
,
"
Had
I
but
served
God
as
diligently
as
I
have
served
the
King
,
He
would
not
have
given
me
over
,
in
my
grey
hairs
.
 
<EOS>
Howbeit
,
this
is
my
just
reward
for
my
pains
and
diligence
,
not
regarding
my
service
to
God
,
but
only
my
duty
to
my
prince
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
news
of
his
death
was
quickly
carried
to
the
King
,
who
was
amusing
himself
with
archery
in
the
garden
of
the
magnificent
Palace
at
Hampton
Court
,
which
that
very
Wolsey
had
presented
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
greatest
emotion
his
royal
mind
displayed
at
the
loss
of
a
servant
<EOS>
so
faithful
and
so
ruined
,
was
a
particular
desire
to
lay
hold
of
fifteen
hundred
pounds
which
the
Cardinal
was
reported
to
have
hidden
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
The
opinions
concerning
the
divorce
,
of
the
learned
doctors
and
bishops
and
others
,
being
at
last
collected
,
and
being
generally
in
the
King
's
favour
,
were
forwarded
to
the
Pope
,
with
an
entreaty
that
he
would
now
grant
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Pope
,
who
was
a
timid
man
,
was
half
distracted
between
his
fear
of
his
authority
being
set
aside
in
England
if
he
did
not
do
as
he
was
asked
,
and
his
dread
of
offending
the
Emperor
of
Germany
,
who
was
Queen
Catherine
's
nephew
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
mind
he
still
evaded
and
did
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
THOMAS
CROMWELL
,
who
had
been
one
of
Wolsey
's
faithful
attendants
,
and
had
remained
so
even
in
his
decline
,
advised
the
King
to
take
the
matter
into
his
own
hands
,
and
make
himself
the
head
of
the
whole
Church
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
the
King
by
various
artful
means
,
began
to
do
;
but
he
recompensed
the
clergy
by
allowing
them
to
burn
as
many
people
as
they
pleased
,
for
holding
Luther
's
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
You
must
understand
that
Sir
Thomas
More
,
the
wise
man
who
had
helped
the
King
with
his
book
,
had
been
made
Chancellor
in
Wolsey
's
place
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
was
truly
attached
to
the
Church
as
it
was
even
in
its
abuses
,
he
,
in
this
state
of
things
,
resigned
.
  
<EOS>
Being
now
quite
resolved
to
get
rid
of
Queen
Catherine
,
and
to
marry
Anne
Boleyn
without
more
ado
,
the
King
made
Cranmer
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
and
directed
Queen
Catherine
to
leave
the
Court
.
 
<EOS>
She
obeyed
;
but
replied
that
wherever
she
went
,
she
was
Queen
of
England
still
,
and
would
remain
so
,
to
the
last
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
then
married
Anne
Boleyn
privately
;
and
the
new
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
within
half
a
year
,
declared
his
marriage
with
Queen
Catherine
void
,
and
crowned
Anne
Boleyn
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
She
might
have
known
that
no
good
could
ever
come
from
such
wrong
,
and
that
the
corpulent
brute
who
had
been
so
faithless
and
so
cruel
to
his
first
wife
,
could
be
more
faithless
and
more
cruel
to
his
second
.
 
<EOS>
She
might
have
known
that
,
even
when
he
was
in
love
with
her
,
he
had
been
a
mean
and
selfish
coward
,
running
away
,
like
a
frightened
cur
,
from
her
society
and
her
house
,
when
a
dangerous
sickness
broke
out
in
it
,
and
when
she
might
easily
have
taken
it
and
died
,
as
several
of
the
household
did
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Anne
Boleyn
arrived
at
all
this
knowledge
too
late
,
and
bought
it
at
a
dear
price
.
 
<EOS>
Her
bad
marriage
with
a
worse
man
came
to
its
natural
end
.
<EOS>
Its
natural
end
was
not
,
as
we
shall
too
soon
see
,
a
natural
death
for
her
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Henry
the
Eighth
Part
<EOS>
the
Second
    
THE
Pope
was
thrown
into
a
very
angry
state
of
mind
when
he
heard
of
the
King
's
marriage
,
and
fumed
exceedingly
.
 
<EOS>
Many
of
the
English
monks
and
friars
,
seeing
that
their
order
was
in
danger
,
did
the
same
;
some
even
declaimed
against
the
King
in
church
before
his
face
,
and
were
not
to
be
stopped
until
he
himself
roared
out
"
Silence
!
"
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
not
much
the
worse
for
this
,
took
it
pretty
quietly
;
and
was
very
glad
when
his
Queen
gave
birth
to
a
daughter
,
who
was
christened
ELIZABETH
,
and
declared
Princess
of
Wales
as
her
sister
Mary
had
already
been
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
atrocious
features
of
this
reign
was
that
Henry
the
Eighth
was
always
trimming
between
the
reformed
religion
and
the
unreformed
one
;
so
that
the
more
he
quarrelled
with
the
Pope
,
the
more
of
his
own
subjects
he
roasted
alive
for
not
holding
the
Pope
's
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
an
unfortunate
student
named
John
Frith
,
and
a
poor
simple
tailor
named
Andrew
Hewet
who
loved
him
very
much
,
and
said
that
whatever
John
Frith
believed
HE
believed
,
were
burnt
in
Smithfield
---
to
show
what
a
capital
<EOS>
Christian
the
King
was
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
these
were
speedily
followed
by
two
much
greater
victims
,
Sir
Thomas
More
,
and
John
Fisher
,
the
Bishop
of
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
,
who
was
a
good
and
amiable
old
man
,
had
committed
no
greater
offence
than
believing
in
Elizabeth
Barton
,
called
the
Maid
of
Kent
---
another
of
those
ridiculous
women
who
pretended
to
be
inspired
,
and
to
make
all
sorts
of
heavenly
revelations
,
though
they
indeed
uttered
nothing
but
evil
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
offence
---
as
it
was
pretended
,
but
really
for
denying
the
King
to
be
the
supreme
Head
of
the
Church
---
he
got
into
trouble
,
and
was
put
in
prison
;
but
,
even
then
,
he
might
have
been
suffered
to
die
naturally
(
short
work
having
been
made
of
executing
the
Kentish
Maid
and
her
principal
followers
)
,
but
that
the
Pope
,
to
spite
the
King
,
resolved
to
make
him
a
cardinal
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
the
King
made
a
ferocious
joke
to
the
effect
that
the
Pope
might
send
Fisher
a
red
hat
---
which
is
the
way
they
make
a
cardinal
---
but
he
should
have
no
head
on
which
to
wear
it
;
and
he
was
tried
with
all
unfairness
and
injustice
,
and
sentenced
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
like
a
noble
and
virtuous
old
man
,
and
left
a
worthy
name
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
supposed
,
I
dare
say
,
that
Sir
Thomas
More
would
be
frightened
by
this
example
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
was
not
to
be
easily
terrified
,
and
,
thoroughly
believing
in
the
Pope
,
had
made
up
his
mind
that
the
King
was
not
the
rightful
Head
of
the
Church
,
he
positively
refused
to
say
that
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
crime
he
too
was
tried
and
sentenced
,
after
having
been
in
prison
a
whole
year
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
doomed
to
death
,
and
came
away
from
his
trial
with
the
edge
of
the
executioner
's
axe
<EOS>
turned
towards
him
---
as
was
always
done
in
those
times
when
a
state
prisoner
came
to
that
hopeless
pass
<EOS>
---
he
bore
it
quite
serenely
,
and
gave
his
blessing
to
his
son
,
who
pressed
through
the
crowd
in
Westminster
Hall
and
kneeled
down
to
receive
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
when
he
got
to
the
Tower
Wharf
on
his
way
back
to
his
prison
,
and
his
favourite
daughter
,
MARGARET
ROPER
,
a
very
good
woman
,
rushed
through
the
guards
again
and
again
,
to
kiss
him
and
to
weep
upon
his
neck
,
he
was
overcome
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
recovered
,
and
never
more
showed
any
feeling
but
cheerfulness
and
courage
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
going
up
the
steps
of
the
scaffold
to
his
death
,
he
said
jokingly
to
the
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
,
observing
that
they
were
weak
and
shook
beneath
his
tread
<EOS>
,
"
I
pray
you
,
master
Lieutenant
,
see
me
safe
up
;
and
,
for
my
coming
down
,
I
can
shift
for
myself
.
"
 
<EOS>
Also
he
said
to
the
executioner
,
after
he
had
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
,
"
Let
me
put
my
beard
out
of
the
way
;
for
that
,
at
least
,
has
never
committed
any
treason
.
"
<EOS>
Then
his
head
was
struck
off
at
a
blow
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
executions
were
worthy
of
King
Henry
the
Eighth
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Thomas
More
was
one
of
the
most
virtuous
men
in
his
dominions
,
and
the
Bishop
was
one
of
his
oldest
and
truest
friends
.
 
<EOS>
But
to
be
a
friend
of
that
fellow
was
almost
as
dangerous
as
to
be
his
wife
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
news
of
these
two
murders
got
to
Rome
,
the
Pope
raged
against
the
murderer
more
than
ever
<EOS>
Pope
raged
since
the
world
began
,
and
prepared
a
Bull
,
ordering
his
subjects
to
take
arms
against
him
and
dethrone
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
took
all
possible
precautions
to
keep
that
document
out
of
his
dominions
,
and
set
to
work
in
return
to
suppress
a
great
number
of
the
English
monasteries
and
abbeys
.
  
<EOS>
This
destruction
was
begun
by
a
body
of
commissioners
,
of
whom
Cromwell
(
whom
the
King
had
taken
into
great
favour
)
was
the
head
;
and
was
carried
on
through
some
few
years
to
its
entire
completion
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
many
of
these
religious
establishments
were
religious
in
nothing
but
in
name
,
and
were
crammed
with
lazy
,
indolent
,
and
sensual
monks
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
they
imposed
upon
the
people
in
every
possible
way
;
that
they
had
<EOS>
images
moved
by
wires
,
which
they
pretended
were
miraculously
moved
by
Heaven
;
that
they
had
among
them
a
whole
tun
measure
full
of
teeth
,
all
purporting
to
have
come
out
of
the
head
of
one
saint
,
who
must
indeed
have
been
a
very
extraordinary
person
with
that
enormous
allowance
of
grinders
;
that
they
had
bits
of
coal
which
they
said
had
fried
Saint
Lawrence
,
and
bits
of
toe
-
nails
which
they
said
belonged
to
other
famous
saints
;
penknives
,
and
boots
,
and
girdles
,
which
they
said
belonged
to
others
;
and
that
all
these
bits
of
rubbish
were
called
Relics
,
and
adored
by
the
ignorant
people
.
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
other
hand
,
there
is
no
doubt
either
,
that
the
King
's
officers
and
men
punished
the
good
monks
with
the
bad
;
did
great
injustice
;
demolished
many
beautiful
things
and
many
valuable
libraries
;
destroyed
numbers
of
paintings
,
stained
glass
windows
,
fine
pavements
,
and
carvings
;
and
that
the
whole
court
were
ravenously
greedy
and
rapacious
for
the
division
of
this
great
spoil
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
seems
to
have
grown
almost
mad
in
the
ardour
of
this
pursuit
;
for
he
declared
Thomas
a
Becket
a
traitor
,
though
he
had
been
dead
so
many
years
,
and
had
his
body
dug
up
out
of
his
grave
.
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
as
miraculous
as
the
monks
pretended
,
if
they
had
told
the
truth
,
for
he
was
found
with
one
head
on
his
shoulders
,
and
they
had
shown
another
as
his
undoubted
and
genuine
head
ever
since
his
death
;
it
had
brought
them
vast
sums
of
money
,
too
.
 
<EOS>
The
gold
and
jewels
on
his
shrine
filled
two
great
chests
,
and
eight
men
tottered
as
they
carried
them
away
.
<EOS>
How
rich
the
monasteries
were
you
may
infer
from
the
fact
that
,
when
they
were
all
suppressed
,
one
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
pounds
a
year
---
in
those
days
an
immense
sum
---
came
to
the
Crown
.
  
<EOS>
These
things
were
not
done
without
causing
great
discontent
among
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
The
monks
had
been
good
landlords
and
hospitable
entertainers
of
all
travellers
,
and
had
been
accustomed
to
give
away
a
great
deal
of
corn
,
and
fruit
,
and
meat
,
and
other
things
.
<EOS>
In
those
days
it
was
difficult
to
change
goods
into
money
,
in
consequence
of
the
roads
being
very
few
and
very
bad
,
and
the
carts
,
and
waggons
of
the
worst
description
;
and
they
must
either
have
given
away
some
of
the
good
things
they
possessed
in
enormous
quantities
,
or
have
suffered
them
to
spoil
and
moulder
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
many
of
the
people
missed
what
it
was
more
agreeable
to
get
idly
than
to
work
for
;
and
the
monks
who
were
driven
out
of
their
homes
and
wandered
about
encouraged
their
discontent
;
and
there
were
,
consequently
,
great
risings
in
Lincolnshire
and
Yorkshire
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
put
down
by
terrific
executions
,
from
which
the
monks
themselves
did
not
escape
,
and
the
King
went
on
grunting
and
growling
in
his
own
fat
way
,
like
a
Royal
pig
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
told
all
this
story
of
the
religious
houses
at
one
time
,
to
make
it
plainer
,
and
to
get
back
to
the
King
's
domestic
affairs
.
  
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
Queen
Catherine
was
by
this
time
dead
;
and
the
King
was
by
this
time
as
tired
of
his
second
Queen
as
he
had
been
of
his
first
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
fallen
in
love
with
Anne
when
she
was
in
the
service
of
Catherine
,
so
he
now
fell
in
love
with
another
lady
in
the
service
of
Anne
.
 
<EOS>
See
how
wicked
deeds
are
punished
,
and
how
bitterly
and
self
-
reproachfully
the
Queen
must
now
have
thought
of
her
own
rise
to
the
throne
!
 
<EOS>
The
new
fancy
was
a
LADY
JANE
SEYMOUR
;
and
the
King
no
sooner
set
his
mind
on
her
,
than
he
resolved
to
have
Anne
Boleyn
's
head
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
brought
a
number
of
charges
against
Anne
,
accusing
her
of
dreadful
crimes
which
she
had
never
committed
,
and
implicating
in
them
her
own
brother
and
certain
gentlemen
in
her
service
:
 
among
whom
one
Norris
,
and
Mark
Smeaton
a
musician
,
are
best
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
lords
and
councillors
were
as
afraid
of
the
King
and
as
subservient
to
him
as
the
meanest
peasant
in
England
was
,
they
brought
in
Anne
Boleyn
guilty
,
and
the
other
unfortunate
persons
accused
with
her
,
guilty
too
.
 
<EOS>
Those
gentlemen
died
like
men
,
with
the
exception
of
Smeaton
,
who
had
been
tempted
by
the
King
into
telling
lies
,
which
he
called
confessions
,
and
who
had
expected
to
be
pardoned
;
but
who
,
I
am
very
glad
to
say
,
was
not
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
then
only
the
Queen
to
dispose
of
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
surrounded
in
the
Tower
with
women
spies
;
had
been
monstrously
persecuted
and
foully
slandered
;
and
had
received
no
justice
.
 
<EOS>
But
her
spirit
rose
with
her
afflictions
;
and
,
after
having
in
vain
tried
to
soften
the
King
by
writing
an
affecting
letter
to
him
which
still
exists
,
"
from
her
doleful
prison
in
the
Tower
,
"
she
resigned
herself
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
to
those
about
her
,
very
cheerfully
,
that
she
had
heard
say
the
executioner
was
a
good
one
,
and
that
she
had
a
little
neck
(
she
laughed
and
clasped
it
with
her
hands
as
she
said
that
)
,
and
would
soon
be
out
of
her
pain
.
 
<EOS>
And
she
WAS
soon
out
of
her
pain
,
poor
creature
,
on
the
Green
inside
the
Tower
,
and
her
body
was
flung
into
an
old
box
and
put
away
in
the
ground
under
the
chapel
.
  
<EOS>
There
is
a
story
that
the
King
sat
in
his
palace
listening
very
anxiously
for
the
sound
of
the
cannon
which
was
to
announce
this
new
murder
;
and
that
,
when
he
heard
it
come
booming
on
the
air
,
he
rose
up
in
great
spirits
and
ordered
out
his
dogs
to
go
a
-
hunting
.
<EOS>
He
was
bad
enough
to
do
it
;
but
whether
he
did
it
or
not
,
it
is
certain
that
he
married
Jane
Seymour
the
very
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
I
have
not
much
pleasure
in
recording
that
she
lived
just
long
enough
to
give
birth
to
a
son
who
was
christened
EDWARD
,
and
then
to
die
of
a
fever
:
 
for
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
but
think
that
any
woman
who
married
such
a
ruffian
,
and
knew
what
innocent
blood
was
on
his
hands
,
deserved
the
axe
that
would
assuredly
have
fallen
on
the
neck
of
Jane
Seymour
,
if
she
had
lived
much
longer
.
  
<EOS>
Cranmer
had
done
what
he
could
to
save
some
of
the
Church
property
for
purposes
of
religion
and
education
;
but
,
the
great
families
had
been
so
hungry
to
get
hold
of
it
,
that
very
little
could
be
rescued
for
such
objects
.
 
<EOS>
Even
MILES
COVERDALE
,
who
did
the
people
the
inestimable
service
of
translating
the
Bible
into
English
(
which
the
unreformed
religion
never
permitted
to
be
done
)
,
was
left
in
poverty
while
the
great
families
clutched
the
Church
lands
and
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
had
been
told
that
when
the
Crown
came
into
possession
of
these
funds
,
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
tax
them
;
but
they
were
taxed
afresh
directly
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
fortunate
for
them
,
indeed
,
that
so
many
nobles
were
so
greedy
for
this
wealth
;
since
,
if
it
had
remained
with
the
Crown
,
there
might
have
been
no
end
to
tyranny
for
hundreds
of
years
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
most
active
writers
on
the
Church
's
side
against
the
King
was
a
member
of
his
own
family
---
a
sort
of
distant
cousin
,
REGINALD
POLE
by
name
---
who
attacked
him
in
the
most
violent
manner
(
though
he
received
a
pension
from
him
all
the
time
)
,
and
fought
for
the
Church
with
his
pen
,
day
and
night
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
was
beyond
the
King
's
reach
---
being
in
Italy
---
the
King
politely
invited
him
over
to
discuss
the
subject
;
but
he
,
knowing
better
than
to
come
,
and
wisely
staying
where
he
was
,
the
King
's
rage
fell
upon
his
brother
Lord
Montague
,
the
Marquis
of
Exeter
,
and
some
other
gentlemen
:
 
who
were
tried
for
high
treason
in
corresponding
with
him
and
aiding
him
---
which
they
probably
did
---
and
were
all
executed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
made
Reginald
Pole
a
cardinal
;
but
,
so
much
against
his
will
,
that
it
is
thought
he
even
aspired
in
his
own
mind
to
the
vacant
throne
of
England
,
and
had
hopes
of
marrying
the
Princess
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
His
being
made
a
high
priest
,
however
,
put
an
end
to
all
that
.
 
<EOS>
His
mother
,
the
venerable
Countess
of
Salisbury
---
who
was
,
unfortunately
for
herself
,
within
the
tyrant
's
reach
---
was
the
last
of
his
relatives
on
whom
his
wrath
fell
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
was
told
to
lay
her
grey
head
upon
the
block
,
she
answered
the
executioner
,
"
No
!
 
<EOS>
My
head
never
committed
treason
,
and
if
you
want
it
,
you
shall
seize
it
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
she
ran
round
and
round
the
scaffold
with
the
executioner
striking
at
her
,
and
her
grey
hair
bedabbled
with
blood
;
and
even
when
they
held
her
down
upon
the
block
she
moved
her
head
about
to
the
last
,
resolved
to
be
no
party
to
her
own
barbarous
murder
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
the
people
bore
,
as
they
had
borne
everything
else
.
  
<EOS>
Indeed
they
bore
much
more
;
for
the
slow
fires
of
Smithfield
were
continually
burning
,
and
people
were
constantly
being
roasted
to
death
---
still
to
show
what
a
good
Christian
the
King
was
.
 
<EOS>
He
defied
the
Pope
and
his
Bull
,
which
was
now
issued
,
and
had
come
into
England
;
but
he
burned
innumerable
people
whose
only
offence
was
that
they
differed
from
the
Pope
's
religious
opinions
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
wretched
man
named
LAMBERT
,
among
others
,
who
was
tried
for
this
before
the
King
,
and
with
whom
six
bishops
argued
one
after
another
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
quite
exhausted
(
as
well
he
might
be
,
after
six
bishops
)
,
he
threw
himself
on
the
King
's
mercy
;
but
the
King
blustered
out
that
he
had
no
mercy
for
heretics
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
HE
too
fed
the
fire
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
the
people
bore
,
and
more
than
all
this
yet
.
 
<EOS>
The
national
spirit
seems
to
have
been
banished
from
the
kingdom
at
this
time
.
<EOS>
The
very
people
who
were
executed
for
treason
,
the
very
wives
and
friends
of
the
"
bluff
"
King
,
spoke
of
him
on
the
scaffold
as
a
good
prince
,
and
a
gentle
prince
---
just
as
serfs
in
similar
circumstances
have
been
known
to
do
,
under
the
Sultan
and
Bashaws
of
the
East
,
or
under
the
fierce
old
tyrants
of
Russia
,
who
poured
boiling
and
freezing
water
on
them
alternately
,
until
they
died
.
<EOS>
The
Parliament
were
as
bad
as
the
rest
,
and
gave
the
King
whatever
he
wanted
;
among
other
vile
accommodations
,
they
gave
him
new
powers
of
murdering
,
at
his
will
and
pleasure
,
any
one
whom
he
might
choose
to
call
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
worst
measure
they
passed
was
an
Act
of
Six
Articles
,
commonly
called
at
the
time
"
the
whip
with
six
strings
;
"
which
punished
offences
against
the
Pope
's
opinions
,
without
mercy
,
and
enforced
the
very
worst
parts
of
the
monkish
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Cranmer
would
have
modified
it
,
if
he
could
;
but
,
being
overborne
by
the
Romish
party
,
had
not
the
power
.
 
<EOS>
As
one
of
the
articles
declared
that
priests
should
not
marry
,
and
as
he
was
married
himself
,
he
sent
his
wife
and
children
into
Germany
,
and
began
to
tremble
at
his
danger
;
none
the
less
because
he
was
,
and
had
long
been
,
the
King
's
friend
.
 
<EOS>
This
whip
of
six
strings
was
made
under
the
King
's
own
eye
.
 
<EOS>
It
should
never
be
forgotten
of
him
<EOS>
how
cruelly
he
supported
the
worst
of
the
Popish
doctrines
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
by
opposing
them
.
  
<EOS>
This
amiable
monarch
now
thought
of
taking
another
wife
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposed
to
the
French
King
to
have
some
of
the
ladies
of
the
French
Court
exhibited
before
him
,
that
he
might
make
his
Royal
choice
;
but
the
French
King
answered
that
he
would
rather
not
have
his
ladies
trotted
out
to
be
shown
like
horses
at
a
fair
.
 
<EOS>
He
proposed
to
the
Dowager
Duchess
of
Milan
,
who
replied
that
she
might
have
thought
of
such
a
match
if
she
had
had
two
heads
;
but
,
that
only
owning
one
,
she
must
beg
to
keep
it
safe
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
Cromwell
represented
that
there
was
a
Protestant
Princess
in
Germany
---
those
who
held
the
reformed
religion
were
called
Protestants
,
because
their
leaders
had
Protested
against
the
abuses
and
impositions
of
the
unreformed
Church
---
named
ANNE
OF
CLEVES
,
who
was
beautiful
,
and
would
answer
the
purpose
admirably
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
said
was
she
a
large
woman
,
because
he
must
have
a
fat
wife
?
"
<EOS>
O
yes
,
"
said
Cromwell
;
<EOS>
"
she
was
very
large
,
just
the
thing
.
"
 
<EOS>
On
hearing
this
the
King
sent
over
his
famous
painter
,
Hans
Holbein
,
to
take
her
portrait
.
 
<EOS>
Hans
made
her
out
to
be
so
good
-
looking
that
the
King
was
satisfied
,
and
the
marriage
was
arranged
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
whether
anybody
had
paid
Hans
to
touch
up
the
picture
;
or
whether
Hans
,
like
one
or
two
other
painters
,
flattered
a
princess
in
the
ordinary
way
of
business
<EOS>
,
I
can
not
say
:
 
all
I
know
is
,
that
when
Anne
came
over
and
the
King
went
to
Rochester
to
meet
her
,
and
first
saw
her
without
her
seeing
him
,
he
swore
she
was
"
a
great
Flanders
mare
,
"
and
said
he
would
never
marry
her
.
 
<EOS>
Being
obliged
to
do
it
now
<EOS>
matters
had
gone
so
far
,
he
would
not
give
her
the
presents
he
had
prepared
,
and
would
never
notice
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
forgave
Cromwell
his
part
in
the
affair
.
 
<EOS>
His
downfall
dates
from
that
time
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
quickened
by
his
enemies
,
in
the
interests
of
the
unreformed
religion
,
putting
in
the
King
's
way
,
at
a
state
dinner
,
a
niece
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
CATHERINE
HOWARD
,
a
young
lady
of
fascinating
manners
,
though
small
in
stature
and
not
particularly
beautiful
.
<EOS>
Falling
in
love
with
her
on
the
spot
,
the
King
soon
divorced
Anne
of
Cleves
after
making
her
the
subject
of
much
brutal
talk
,
on
pretence
that
she
had
been
previously
betrothed
to
some
one
else
---
which
would
never
do
for
one
of
his
dignity
---
and
married
Catherine
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
on
his
wedding
day
,
of
all
days
in
the
year
,
he
sent
his
faithful
Cromwell
to
the
scaffold
,
and
had
his
head
struck
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
celebrated
the
occasion
by
burning
at
one
time
,
and
causing
to
be
drawn
to
the
fire
on
the
same
hurdles
,
some
Protestant
prisoners
for
denying
the
Pope
's
doctrines
,
and
some
Roman
Catholic
prisoners
for
denying
his
own
supremacy
.
 
<EOS>
Still
the
people
bore
it
,
and
not
a
gentleman
in
England
raised
his
hand
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
by
a
just
retribution
,
it
soon
came
out
that
Catherine
Howard
,
before
her
marriage
,
had
been
really
guilty
of
such
crimes
as
the
King
had
falsely
attributed
to
his
second
wife
Anne
Boleyn
;
so
,
again
the
dreadful
axe
made
the
King
a
widower
,
and
this
Queen
passed
away
as
so
many
in
that
reign
had
passed
away
before
her
.
<EOS>
As
an
appropriate
pursuit
under
the
circumstances
,
Henry
then
applied
himself
to
superintending
the
composition
of
a
religious
book
called
"
A
necessary
doctrine
for
any
Christian
Man
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
must
have
been
a
little
confused
in
his
mind
,
I
think
,
at
about
this
period
;
for
he
was
so
false
to
himself
as
to
be
true
to
some
one
:
that
some
one
being
Cranmer
,
whom
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
and
others
of
his
enemies
tried
to
ruin
;
but
to
whom
the
King
was
steadfast
,
and
to
whom
he
one
night
gave
his
ring
,
charging
him
when
he
should
find
himself
,
next
day
,
accused
of
treason
,
to
show
it
to
the
council
board
.
 
<EOS>
This
Cranmer
did
to
the
confusion
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
King
thought
he
might
want
him
a
little
longer
.
  
<EOS>
He
married
yet
once
more
.
 
<EOS>
Yes
,
strange
to
say
,
he
found
in
England
another
woman
who
would
become
his
wife
,
and
she
was
CATHERINE
PARR
,
widow
of
Lord
Latimer
.
 
<EOS>
She
leaned
towards
the
reformed
religion
;
and
it
is
some
comfort
to
know
,
that
she
tormented
the
King
considerably
by
arguing
a
variety
of
doctrinal
points
with
him
on
all
possible
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
very
nearly
done
this
to
her
own
destruction
.
 
<EOS>
After
one
of
these
conversations
the
King
in
a
very
black
mood
actually
instructed
GARDINER
,
one
of
his
Bishops
who
favoured
the
Popish
opinions
,
to
draw
a
bill
of
accusation
against
her
,
which
would
have
inevitably
brought
her
to
the
scaffold
where
her
predecessors
had
died
,
but
that
one
of
her
friends
picked
up
the
paper
of
instructions
which
had
been
dropped
in
the
palace
,
and
gave
her
timely
notice
.
 
<EOS>
She
fell
ill
with
terror
;
but
managed
the
King
so
well
when
he
came
to
entrap
her
into
further
statements
---
by
saying
that
she
had
only
spoken
on
such
points
to
divert
his
mind
and
to
get
some
information
from
his
extraordinary
wisdom
---
that
he
gave
her
a
kiss
and
called
her
his
sweetheart
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
when
the
Chancellor
came
next
day
actually
to
take
her
to
the
Tower
,
the
King
sent
him
about
his
business
,
and
honoured
him
with
the
epithets
of
a
beast
,
a
knave
,
and
a
fool
.
 
<EOS>
So
near
was
Catherine
Parr
to
the
block
,
and
so
narrow
was
her
escape
!
  
<EOS>
There
was
war
with
Scotland
in
this
reign
,
and
a
short
clumsy
war
with
France
for
favouring
Scotland
;
but
,
the
events
at
home
were
so
dreadful
,
and
leave
such
an
enduring
stain
on
the
country
,
<EOS>
that
I
need
say
no
more
of
what
happened
abroad
.
  
<EOS>
A
few
more
horrors
,
and
this
reign
is
over
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
lady
,
ANNE
ASKEW
,
in
Lincolnshire
,
who
inclined
to
the
Protestant
opinions
,
and
whose
husband
being
a
fierce
Catholic
,
turned
her
out
of
his
house
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
to
London
,
and
was
considered
as
offending
against
the
six
articles
,
and
was
taken
to
the
Tower
,
and
put
upon
the
rack
---
probably
because
it
was
hoped
that
she
might
,
in
her
agony
,
criminate
some
obnoxious
persons
;
if
falsely
,
so
much
the
better
.
<EOS>
She
was
tortured
without
uttering
a
cry
,
until
the
Lieutenant
of
the
Tower
would
suffer
his
men
to
torture
her
no
more
;
and
then
two
priests
who
were
present
actually
pulled
off
their
robes
,
and
turned
the
wheels
of
the
rack
with
their
own
hands
,
so
rending
and
twisting
and
breaking
her
that
she
was
afterwards
carried
to
the
fire
in
a
chair
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
burned
with
three
others
,
a
gentleman
,
a
clergyman
,
and
a
tailor
;
and
so
the
world
went
on
.
  
<EOS>
Either
the
King
became
afraid
of
the
power
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
and
his
son
the
Earl
of
Surrey
,
or
they
gave
him
some
offence
,
but
he
resolved
to
pull
THEM
down
,
to
follow
all
the
rest
who
were
gone
.
 
<EOS>
The
son
was
tried
first
---
of
course
for
nothing
---
and
defended
himself
bravely
;
but
of
course
he
was
found
guilty
,
and
of
course
he
was
executed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
his
father
was
laid
hold
of
,
and
left
for
death
too
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
King
himself
was
left
for
death
by
a
Greater
King
,
and
the
earth
was
to
be
rid
of
him
at
last
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
now
a
swollen
,
hideous
spectacle
,
with
a
great
hole
in
his
leg
,
and
so
odious
to
every
sense
that
it
was
dreadful
to
approach
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
found
to
be
dying
,
Cranmer
was
sent
for
from
his
palace
at
Croydon
,
and
came
with
all
speed
,
but
found
him
speechless
.
 
<EOS>
Happily
,
in
that
hour
he
perished
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
in
the
fifty
-
sixth
year
of
his
age
,
and
the
thirty
-
eighth
of
his
reign
.
  
<EOS>
Henry
the
Eighth
has
been
favoured
by
some
Protestant
writers
,
because
the
Reformation
was
achieved
in
his
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
mighty
merit
of
it
lies
with
other
men
and
not
with
him
;
and
it
can
be
rendered
none
the
worse
by
this
monster
's
crimes
,
and
none
the
better
by
any
defence
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
plain
truth
is
,
that
he
was
a
most
intolerable
ruffian
,
a
disgrace
to
human
nature
,
and
a
blot
of
blood
and
grease
upon
the
History
of
England
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Edward
<EOS>
the
Sixth
    
HENRY
THE
EIGHTH
had
made
a
will
,
appointing
a
council
of
sixteen
to
govern
the
kingdom
for
his
son
while
he
was
under
age
<EOS>
(
he
was
now
only
ten
years
old
)
,
and
another
council
of
twelve
to
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
powerful
of
the
first
council
was
the
EARL
OF
HERTFORD
,
the
young
King
's
uncle
,
who
lost
no
time
in
bringing
his
nephew
with
great
state
up
to
Enfield
,
and
thence
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
considered
at
the
time
a
striking
proof
of
virtue
in
the
young
King
that
he
was
sorry
for
his
father
's
death
;
but
,
as
common
subjects
have
that
virtue
too
,
<EOS>
sometimes
,
we
will
say
no
more
about
it
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
curious
part
of
the
late
King
's
will
,
requiring
his
executors
to
fulfil
whatever
promises
he
had
made
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
court
wondering
what
these
might
be
,
the
Earl
of
Hertford
and
the
other
noblemen
interested
,
said
that
they
were
promises
to
advance
and
enrich
THEM
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
Earl
of
Hertford
made
himself
DUKE
OF
SOMERSET
,
and
made
his
brother
EDWARD
SEYMOUR
a
baron
;
and
there
were
various
similar
promotions
,
all
very
agreeable
to
the
parties
concerned
,
and
very
dutiful
,
no
doubt
,
to
the
late
King
's
memory
.
<EOS>
To
be
more
dutiful
still
,
they
made
themselves
rich
out
of
the
Church
lands
,
and
were
very
comfortable
.
 
<EOS>
The
new
Duke
of
Somerset
caused
himself
to
be
declared
PROTECTOR
of
the
kingdom
,
and
was
,
indeed
,
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
As
young
Edward
the
Sixth
had
been
brought
up
in
the
principles
of
the
Protestant
religion
,
everybody
knew
that
they
would
be
maintained
.
 
<EOS>
But
Cranmer
,
to
whom
they
were
chiefly
entrusted
,
advanced
them
steadily
and
temperately
.
 
<EOS>
Many
superstitious
and
ridiculous
practices
were
stopped
;
but
practices
which
were
harmless
were
not
interfered
with
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Somerset
,
the
Protector
,
was
anxious
to
have
the
young
King
engaged
in
marriage
to
the
young
Queen
of
Scotland
,
in
order
to
prevent
that
princess
from
making
an
alliance
with
any
foreign
power
;
but
,
as
a
large
party
in
Scotland
were
unfavourable
to
this
plan
,
he
invaded
that
country
.
 
<EOS>
His
excuse
for
doing
so
was
,
that
the
Border
men
---
that
is
,
the
Scotch
who
lived
in
that
part
of
the
country
where
England
and
Scotland
joined
---
troubled
the
English
very
much
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
were
two
sides
to
this
question
;
for
the
English
Border
men
troubled
the
Scotch
too
;
and
,
through
many
long
years
,
there
were
perpetual
border
quarrels
which
gave
rise
to
numbers
of
old
tales
and
songs
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
Protector
invaded
Scotland
;
and
ARRAN
,
the
Scottish
Regent
,
with
an
army
twice
as
large
as
his
,
advanced
to
meet
him
.
 
<EOS>
They
encountered
on
the
banks
of
the
river
Esk
,
within
a
few
miles
of
Edinburgh
;
and
there
,
after
a
little
skirmish
,
the
Protector
made
such
moderate
proposals
,
in
offering
to
retire
if
the
Scotch
would
only
engage
not
to
marry
their
princess
to
any
foreign
prince
,
that
the
Regent
thought
the
English
were
afraid
.
 
<EOS>
But
in
this
he
made
a
horrible
mistake
;
for
the
English
soldiers
on
land
,
and
the
English
sailors
on
the
water
,
so
set
upon
the
Scotch
,
that
they
broke
and
fled
,
and
more
than
ten
thousand
of
them
were
killed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
dreadful
battle
,
for
the
fugitives
were
slain
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
The
ground
for
four
miles
,
all
the
way
to
Edinburgh
,
was
strewn
with
dead
men
,
and
with
arms
,
and
legs
,
and
heads
.
 
<EOS>
Some
hid
themselves
in
streams
and
were
drowned
;
some
threw
away
their
armour
and
were
killed
running
,
almost
naked
;
but
in
this
battle
of
Pinkey
the
English
lost
only
two
or
three
hundred
men
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
much
better
clothed
than
the
Scotch
;
at
the
poverty
of
whose
appearance
and
country
they
were
exceedingly
astonished
.
  
<EOS>
A
Parliament
was
called
when
Somerset
came
back
,
and
it
repealed
the
whip
with
six
strings
,
and
did
one
or
two
other
good
things
;
though
it
unhappily
retained
the
punishment
of
burning
for
those
people
who
did
not
make
believe
to
believe
,
in
all
religious
matters
,
what
the
Government
had
declared
that
they
must
and
should
believe
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
made
a
foolish
law
(
meant
to
put
down
beggars
)
,
that
any
man
who
lived
idly
and
loitered
about
for
three
days
together
,
should
be
burned
with
a
hot
iron
,
made
a
slave
,
and
wear
an
iron
fetter
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
savage
absurdity
soon
came
to
an
end
,
and
went
the
way
of
a
great
many
other
foolish
laws
.
  
<EOS>
The
Protector
was
now
so
proud
that
he
sat
in
Parliament
before
all
the
nobles
,
on
the
right
hand
of
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
Many
other
noblemen
,
who
only
wanted
to
be
as
proud
if
they
could
get
a
chance
,
became
his
enemies
of
course
;
and
it
is
supposed
that
he
came
back
suddenly
from
Scotland
because
he
had
received
news
that
his
brother
,
LORD
SEYMOUR
,
was
becoming
dangerous
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
lord
was
now
High
Admiral
of
England
;
a
very
handsome
man
,
and
a
great
favourite
with
the
Court
ladies
---
even
with
the
young
Princess
Elizabeth
,
who
romped
with
him
a
little
more
than
young
princesses
in
these
times
do
with
any
one
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
married
Catherine
Parr
,
the
late
King
's
widow
,
who
was
now
dead
;
and
,
to
strengthen
his
power
,
he
secretly
supplied
the
young
King
with
money
.
 
<EOS>
He
may
even
have
engaged
with
some
of
his
brother
's
enemies
in
a
plot
to
carry
the
boy
off
.
 
<EOS>
On
these
and
other
accusations
,
at
any
rate
,
he
was
confined
in
the
Tower
,
impeached
,
and
found
guilty
;
his
own
brother
's
name
being
---
unnatural
and
sad
to
tell
---
the
first
signed
to
the
warrant
of
his
execution
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
executed
on
Tower
Hill
,
and
died
denying
his
treason
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
his
last
proceedings
in
this
world
was
to
write
two
letters
,
one
to
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
and
one
to
the
Princess
Mary
,
which
a
servant
of
his
took
charge
of
,
and
concealed
in
his
shoe
.
 
<EOS>
These
letters
are
supposed
to
have
urged
them
against
his
brother
,
and
to
revenge
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
What
they
truly
contained
is
not
known
;
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
,
at
one
time
,
obtained
great
influence
over
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
while
,
the
Protestant
religion
was
making
progress
.
 
<EOS>
The
images
which
the
people
had
gradually
come
to
worship
,
were
removed
from
the
churches
;
the
people
were
informed
that
they
need
not
confess
themselves
to
priests
unless
they
chose
;
a
common
prayer
-
book
was
drawn
up
in
the
English
language
,
which
all
could
understand
,
and
many
other
improvements
were
made
;
still
moderately
.
 
<EOS>
For
Cranmer
was
a
very
moderate
man
,
and
even
restrained
the
Protestant
clergy
from
violently
abusing
the
unreformed
religion
---
as
they
very
often
did
,
and
which
was
not
a
good
example
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
people
were
at
this
time
in
great
distress
.
<EOS>
The
rapacious
nobility
who
had
come
into
possession
of
the
Church
lands
,
were
very
bad
landlords
.
 
<EOS>
They
enclosed
great
quantities
of
ground
for
the
feeding
of
sheep
,
which
was
then
more
profitable
than
the
growing
of
crops
;
and
this
increased
the
general
distress
.
<EOS>
So
the
people
,
who
still
understood
little
of
what
was
going
on
about
them
,
and
still
readily
believed
what
the
homeless
monks
told
them
---
many
of
whom
had
been
their
good
friends
in
their
better
days
---
took
it
into
their
heads
that
all
this
was
owing
to
the
reformed
religion
,
and
therefore
rose
,
in
many
parts
of
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
The
most
powerful
risings
were
in
Devonshire
and
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
In
Devonshire
,
the
rebellion
was
so
strong
that
ten
thousand
men
united
within
a
few
days
,
and
even
laid
siege
to
Exeter
.
 
<EOS>
But
LORD
RUSSELL
,
coming
to
the
assistance
of
the
citizens
who
defended
that
town
,
defeated
the
rebels
;
and
,
not
only
hanged
the
Mayor
of
one
place
,
but
hanged
the
vicar
of
another
from
his
own
church
steeple
.
<EOS>
What
with
hanging
and
killing
by
the
sword
,
four
thousand
of
the
rebels
are
supposed
to
have
fallen
in
that
one
county
.
 
<EOS>
In
Norfolk
(
where
the
rising
was
more
against
the
enclosure
of
open
lands
than
against
the
reformed
religion
)
,
the
popular
leader
was
a
man
named
ROBERT
KET
,
a
tanner
of
Wymondham
.
 
<EOS>
The
mob
were
,
in
the
first
instance
,
excited
against
the
tanner
by
one
JOHN
FLOWERDEW
,
a
gentleman
who
owed
him
a
grudge
:
 
but
the
tanner
was
more
than
a
match
for
the
gentleman
,
since
he
soon
got
the
people
on
his
side
,
and
established
himself
near
Norwich
with
quite
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
large
oak
-
tree
in
that
place
,
on
a
spot
called
Moushold
Hill
,
which
Ket
named
the
Tree
of
Reformation
;
and
under
its
green
boughs
,
he
and
his
men
sat
,
in
the
midsummer
weather
,
holding
courts
of
justice
,
and
debating
affairs
of
state
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
even
impartial
enough
to
allow
some
rather
tiresome
public
speakers
to
get
up
into
this
Tree
of
Reformation
,
and
point
out
their
errors
to
them
,
in
long
discourses
,
while
they
lay
listening
(
not
always
without
some
grumbling
and
growling
)
in
the
shade
below
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
one
sunny
July
day
,
a
herald
appeared
below
the
tree
,
and
proclaimed
Ket
and
all
his
men
traitors
,
unless
from
that
moment
they
dispersed
and
went
home
:
 
in
which
case
they
were
to
receive
a
pardon
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
Ket
and
his
men
made
light
of
the
herald
and
became
stronger
than
ever
,
until
the
Earl
of
Warwick
went
after
them
with
a
sufficient
force
,
and
cut
them
all
to
pieces
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
were
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
,
as
traitors
,
and
their
limbs
were
sent
into
various
country
places
to
be
a
terror
to
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
Nine
of
them
were
hanged
upon
nine
green
branches
of
the
Oak
of
Reformation
;
and
<EOS>
so
,
for
the
time
,
that
tree
may
be
said
to
have
withered
away
.
  
<EOS>
The
Protector
,
though
a
haughty
man
,
had
compassion
for
the
real
distresses
of
the
common
people
,
and
a
sincere
desire
to
help
them
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
too
proud
and
too
high
in
degree
to
hold
even
their
favour
steadily
;
and
many
of
the
nobles
always
envied
and
hated
him
,
because
they
were
as
proud
and
not
as
high
as
he
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
at
this
time
building
a
great
Palace
in
the
Strand
:
 
to
get
the
stone
for
which
he
blew
up
church
steeples
with
gunpowder
,
and
pulled
down
bishops
"
houses
:
 
thus
making
himself
still
more
disliked
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
,
his
principal
enemy
,
the
Earl
of
Warwick
---
Dudley
by
name
,
and
the
son
of
that
Dudley
who
had
made
himself
so
odious
with
Empson
,
in
the
reign
of
Henry
the
Seventh
---
joined
with
seven
other
members
of
the
Council
against
him
,
formed
a
separate
Council
;
and
,
becoming
stronger
in
a
few
days
,
sent
him
to
the
Tower
under
twenty
-
nine
articles
of
accusation
.
 
<EOS>
After
being
sentenced
by
the
Council
to
the
forfeiture
of
all
his
offices
and
lands
,
he
was
liberated
and
pardoned
,
on
making
a
very
humble
submission
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
even
taken
back
into
the
Council
again
,
after
having
suffered
this
fall
,
and
married
his
daughter
,
LADY
ANNE
SEYMOUR
,
to
Warwick
's
eldest
son
.
 
<EOS>
But
such
a
reconciliation
was
little
likely
to
last
,
and
did
not
outlive
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
Warwick
,
having
got
himself
made
Duke
of
Northumberland
,
and
having
advanced
the
more
important
of
his
friends
,
then
finished
the
history
by
causing
the
Duke
of
Somerset
and
his
friend
LORD
GREY
,
and
others
,
to
be
arrested
for
treason
,
in
having
conspired
to
seize
and
dethrone
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
also
accused
of
having
intended
to
seize
the
new
Duke
of
Northumberland
,
with
his
friends
LORD
NORTHAMPTON
and
LORD
PEMBROKE
;
to
murder
them
if
they
found
need
;
and
to
raise
the
City
to
revolt
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
the
fallen
Protector
positively
denied
;
except
that
he
confessed
to
having
spoken
of
the
murder
of
those
three
noblemen
,
but
having
never
designed
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
acquitted
of
the
charge
of
treason
,
and
found
guilty
of
the
other
charges
;
so
when
the
people
---
who
remembered
his
having
been
their
friend
,
now
that
he
was
disgraced
and
in
danger
,
saw
him
come
out
from
his
trial
with
the
axe
turned
from
him
---
they
thought
he
was
altogether
acquitted
,
and
sent
up
a
loud
shout
of
joy
.
  
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
of
Somerset
was
ordered
to
be
beheaded
on
Tower
Hill
,
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
proclamations
were
issued
bidding
the
citizens
keep
at
home
until
after
ten
.
 
<EOS>
They
filled
the
streets
,
however
,
and
crowded
the
place
of
execution
as
soon
as
it
was
light
;
and
,
with
sad
faces
and
sad
hearts
,
saw
the
once
powerful
Protector
ascend
the
scaffold
to
lay
his
head
upon
the
dreadful
block
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
yet
saying
his
last
words
to
them
with
manly
courage
,
and
telling
them
,
in
particular
,
how
it
comforted
him
,
at
that
pass
,
to
have
assisted
in
reforming
the
national
religion
,
a
member
of
the
Council
was
seen
riding
up
on
horseback
.
 
<EOS>
They
again
thought
that
the
Duke
was
saved
by
his
bringing
a
reprieve
,
and
again
shouted
for
joy
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
himself
told
them
they
were
mistaken
,
and
laid
down
his
head
and
had
it
struck
off
at
a
blow
.
  
<EOS>
Many
of
the
bystanders
rushed
forward
and
steeped
their
handkerchiefs
in
his
blood
,
as
a
mark
of
their
affection
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
,
indeed
,
been
capable
of
many
good
acts
,
and
one
of
them
was
discovered
after
he
was
no
more
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
Durham
,
a
very
good
man
,
had
been
informed
against
to
the
Council
,
when
the
Duke
was
in
power
,
as
having
answered
a
treacherous
letter
proposing
a
rebellion
against
the
reformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
answer
could
not
be
found
,
he
could
not
be
declared
guilty
;
but
it
was
now
discovered
,
hidden
by
the
Duke
himself
among
some
private
papers
,
in
his
regard
for
that
good
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
lost
his
office
,
and
was
deprived
of
his
possessions
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
very
pleasant
to
know
that
while
his
uncle
lay
in
prison
under
sentence
of
death
,
the
young
King
was
being
vastly
entertained
by
plays
,
and
dances
,
and
sham
fights
:
 
<EOS>
but
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
,
for
he
kept
a
journal
himself
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
pleasanter
to
know
that
not
a
single
Roman
Catholic
was
burnt
in
this
reign
for
holding
that
religion
;
though
two
wretched
victims
suffered
for
heresy
.
 
<EOS>
One
,
a
woman
named
JOAN
BOCHER
,
for
professing
some
opinions
that
even
she
could
only
explain
in
unintelligible
jargon
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
a
Dutchman
,
named
VON
PARIS
,
who
practised
as
a
surgeon
in
London
.
 
<EOS>
Edward
was
,
to
his
credit
,
exceedingly
unwilling
to
sign
the
warrant
for
the
woman
's
execution
:
 
shedding
tears
before
he
did
so
,
and
telling
Cranmer
,
who
urged
him
to
do
it
(
though
Cranmer
really
would
have
spared
the
woman
at
first
,
but
for
her
own
determined
obstinacy
)
,
that
the
guilt
was
not
his
,
but
that
of
the
man
who
so
strongly
urged
the
dreadful
act
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
,
too
soon
,
whether
the
time
ever
came
when
Cranmer
is
likely
to
have
remembered
this
with
sorrow
and
remorse
.
  
<EOS>
Cranmer
and
RIDLEY
(
at
first
Bishop
of
Rochester
,
and
afterwards
Bishop
of
London
)
were
the
most
powerful
of
the
clergy
of
this
reign
.
 
<EOS>
Others
were
imprisoned
and
deprived
of
their
property
for
still
adhering
to
the
unreformed
religion
;
the
most
important
among
whom
were
GARDINER
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
HEATH
Bishop
of
Worcester
,
DAY
Bishop
of
Chichester
,
and
BONNER
that
Bishop
of
London
who
was
superseded
by
Ridley
.
 
<EOS>
The
Princess
Mary
,
who
inherited
her
mother
's
gloomy
temper
,
and
hated
the
reformed
religion
as
connected
with
her
mother
's
wrongs
and
sorrows
<EOS>
---
she
knew
nothing
else
about
it
,
always
refusing
to
read
a
single
book
in
which
it
was
truly
described
---
held
by
the
unreformed
religion
too
,
and
was
the
only
person
in
the
kingdom
for
whom
the
old
Mass
was
allowed
to
be
performed
;
nor
would
the
young
King
have
made
that
exception
even
in
her
favour
,
but
for
the
strong
persuasions
of
Cranmer
and
Ridley
.
 
<EOS>
He
always
viewed
it
with
horror
;
and
when
he
fell
into
a
sickly
condition
,
after
having
been
very
ill
,
first
of
the
measles
and
then
of
the
small
-
pox
,
he
was
greatly
troubled
in
mind
to
think
that
if
he
died
,
and
she
,
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
,
succeeded
,
the
Roman
Catholic
religion
would
be
set
up
again
.
  
<EOS>
This
uneasiness
,
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
was
not
slow
to
encourage
:
 
for
,
if
the
Princess
Mary
came
to
the
throne
,
he
,
who
had
taken
part
with
the
Protestants
,
was
sure
to
be
disgraced
.
<EOS>
Now
,
the
Duchess
of
Suffolk
was
descended
from
King
Henry
the
Seventh
;
and
,
if
she
resigned
what
little
or
no
right
<EOS>
she
had
,
in
favour
of
her
daughter
LADY
JANE
GREY
,
that
would
be
the
succession
to
promote
the
Duke
's
greatness
;
because
LORD
GUILFORD
DUDLEY
,
one
of
his
sons
,
was
,
at
this
very
time
,
newly
married
to
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
worked
upon
the
King
's
fears
,
and
persuaded
him
to
set
aside
both
the
Princess
Mary
and
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
and
assert
his
right
to
appoint
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
the
young
King
handed
to
the
Crown
lawyers
a
writing
signed
half
a
dozen
times
over
by
himself
,
appointing
Lady
Jane
Grey
to
succeed
to
the
Crown
,
and
requiring
them
to
have
his
will
made
out
according
to
law
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
much
against
it
at
first
,
and
told
the
King
so
;
but
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
---
being
so
violent
about
it
that
the
lawyers
even
expected
him
to
beat
them
,
and
hotly
declaring
that
,
stripped
to
his
shirt
,
he
would
fight
any
man
in
such
a
quarrel
---
they
yielded
.
<EOS>
Cranmer
,
also
,
at
first
hesitated
;
pleading
that
he
had
sworn
to
maintain
the
succession
of
the
Crown
to
the
Princess
Mary
;
but
,
he
was
a
weak
man
in
his
resolutions
,
and
afterwards
signed
the
document
with
the
rest
of
the
council
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
completed
none
too
soon
;
for
Edward
was
now
sinking
in
a
rapid
decline
;
and
,
by
way
of
making
him
better
,
they
handed
him
over
to
a
woman
-
doctor
who
pretended
to
be
able
to
cure
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
speedily
got
worse
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
sixth
of
July
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
fifty
-
three
,
he
died
,
very
peaceably
and
piously
,
praying
God
,
with
his
last
breath
,
to
protect
the

This
King
died
in
the
sixteenth
year
of
his
age
,
and
in
the
seventh
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
difficult
to
judge
what
the
character
of
one
so
young
might
afterwards
have
become
among
so
many
bad
,
ambitious
,
quarrelling
nobles
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
he
was
an
amiable
boy
,
of
very
good
abilities
,
and
had
nothing
coarse
or
cruel
or
brutal
in
his
disposition
---
which
in
the
son
of
such
a
father
is
rather
surprising
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Mary
    
THE
Duke
of
Northumberland
was
very
anxious
to
keep
the
young
King
's
death
a
secret
,
in
order
that
he
might
get
the
two
Princesses
into
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Princess
Mary
,
being
informed
of
that
event
as
she
was
on
her
way
to
London
to
see
her
sick
brother
,
turned
her
horse
's
head
,
and
rode
away
into
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Arundel
was
her
friend
,
and
it
was
he
who
sent
her
warning
of
what
had
happened
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
secret
could
not
be
kept
,
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
and
the
council
sent
for
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
and
some
of
the
aldermen
,
and
made
a
merit
of
telling
it
to
them
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
they
made
it
known
to
the
people
,
and
set
off
to
inform
Lady
Jane
Grey
that
she
was
to
be
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
a
pretty
girl
of
only
sixteen
,
and
was
amiable
,
learned
,
and
clever
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
lords
who
came
to
her
,
fell
on
their
knees
before
her
,
and
told
her
what
tidings
they
brought
<EOS>
,
she
was
so
astonished
that
she
fainted
.
 
<EOS>
On
recovering
,
she
expressed
her
sorrow
for
the
young
King
's
death
,
and
said
that
she
knew
she
was
unfit
to
govern
the
kingdom
;
but
that
if
she
must
be
Queen
,
she
prayed
God
to
direct
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
then
at
Sion
House
,
near
Brentford
;
and
the
lords
took
her
down
the
river
in
state
to
the
Tower
,
that
she
might
remain
there
(
as
the
custom
was
)
until
she
was
crowned
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
people
were
not
at
all
favourable
to
Lady
Jane
,
considering
that
the
right
to
be
Queen
was
Mary
's
,
and
greatly
disliking
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
put
into
a
better
humour
by
the
Duke
's
causing
a
vintner
's
servant
,
one
Gabriel
Pot
,
to
be
taken
up
for
expressing
his
dissatisfaction
among
the
crowd
,
and
to
have
his
ears
nailed
to
the
pillory
,
and
cut
off
.
 
<EOS>
Some
powerful
men
among
the
nobility
declared
on
Mary
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
They
raised
troops
to
support
her
cause
,
had
her
proclaimed
Queen
at
Norwich
,
and
gathered
around
her
at
the
castle
of
Framlingham
,
which
belonged
to
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
she
was
not
considered
so
safe
as
yet
,
but
that
it
was
best
to
keep
her
in
a
castle
on
the
sea
-
coast
,
from
whence
she
might
be
sent
abroad
,
if
necessary
.
  
<EOS>
The
Council
would
have
despatched
Lady
Jane
's
father
,
the
Duke
of
Suffolk
,
as
the
general
of
the
army
against
this
force
;
but
,
as
Lady
Jane
implored
that
her
father
might
remain
with
her
,
and
as
he
was
known
to
be
but
a
weak
man
,
they
told
the
Duke
of
Northumberland
that
he
must
take
the
command
himself
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
very
ready
to
do
so
,
as
he
mistrusted
the
Council
much
;
but
there
was
no
help
for
it
,
and
he
set
forth
with
a
heavy
heart
,
observing
to
a
lord
who
rode
beside
him
through
Shoreditch
at
the
head
of
the
troops
,
that
,
although
the
people
pressed
in
great
numbers
to
look
at
them
,
they
were
terribly
silent
.
  
<EOS>
And
his
fears
for
himself
turned
out
to
be
well
founded
.
 
<EOS>
While
he
was
waiting
at
Cambridge
for
further
help
from
the
Council
,
the
Council
took
it
into
their
heads
to
turn
their
backs
on
Lady
Jane
's
cause
,
and
to
take
up
the
Princess
Mary
's
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
chiefly
owing
to
the
before
-
mentioned
Earl
of
Arundel
,
who
represented
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
,
in
a
second
interview
with
those
sagacious
persons
,
that
,
as
for
himself
,
he
did
not
perceive
the
Reformed
religion
to
be
in
much
danger
---
which
Lord
Pembroke
backed
by
flourishing
his
sword
as
another
kind
of
persuasion
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
Mayor
and
aldermen
,
thus
enlightened
,
said
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
the
Princess
Mary
ought
to
be
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
she
was
proclaimed
at
the
Cross
by
St
Paul
's
,
and
barrels
of
wine
were
given
to
the
people
,
and
they
got
very
drunk
,
and
danced
round
blazing
bonfires
---
little
thinking
,
<EOS>
poor
wretches
,
what
other
bonfires
would
soon
be
blazing
in
Queen
Mary
's
name
.
  
<EOS>
After
a
ten
days
"
dream
of
royalty
,
Lady
Jane
Grey
resigned
the
Crown
with
great
willingness
,
saying
that
she
had
only
accepted
it
in
obedience
to
her
father
and
mother
;
and
went
gladly
back
to
her
pleasant
house
by
the
river
,
and
her
books
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
then
came
on
towards
London
;
and
at
Wanstead
in
Essex
,
was
joined
by
her
half
-
sister
,
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
They
passed
through
the
streets
of
London
to
the
Tower
,
and
there
the
new
Queen
met
some
eminent
prisoners
then
confined
in
it
,
kissed
them
,
and
gave
them
their
liberty
.
 
<EOS>
Among
these
was
that
Gardiner
,
Bishop
of
Winchester
,
who
had
been
imprisoned
in
the
last
reign
for
holding
to
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Him
<EOS>
she
soon
made
chancellor
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Northumberland
had
been
taken
prisoner
,
and
,
together
with
his
son
and
five
others
,
was
quickly
brought
before
the
Council
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
not
unnaturally
,
asked
that
Council
,
in
his
defence
,
whether
it
was
treason
to
obey
orders
that
had
been
issued
under
the
great
seal
;
and
,
if
it
were
,
whether
they
,
who
had
obeyed
them
too
,
ought
to
be
his
judges
?
 
<EOS>
But
they
made
light
of
these
points
;
and
,
being
resolved
to
have
him
out
of
the
way
,
soon
sentenced
him
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
risen
into
power
upon
the
death
of
another
man
,
and
made
but
a
poor
show
(
as
might
be
expected
)
when
he
himself
lay
low
.
 
<EOS>
He
entreated
Gardiner
to
let
him
live
,
if
it
were
only
in
a
mouse
's
hole
;
<EOS>
and
,
when
he
ascended
the
scaffold
to
be
beheaded
on
Tower
Hill
,
addressed
the
people
in
a
miserable
way
,
saying
that
he
had
been
incited
by
others
,
and
exhorting
them
to
return
to
the
unreformed
religion
,
which
he
told
them
was
his
faith
.
 
<EOS>
There
seems
reason
to
suppose
that
he
expected
a
pardon
even
then
,
in
return
for
this
confession
;
but
it
matters
little
whether
he
did
or
not
.
<EOS>
His
head
was
struck
off
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
was
now
crowned
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
thirty
-
seven
years
of
age
,
short
and
thin
,
wrinkled
in
the
face
,
and
very
unhealthy
.
 
<EOS>
But
she
had
a
great
liking
for
show
and
for
bright
colours
,
and
all
the
ladies
of
her
Court
were
magnificently
dressed
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
a
great
liking
too
for
old
customs
,
without
much
sense
in
them
;
and
she
was
oiled
in
the
oldest
way
,
and
blessed
in
the
oldest
way
,
and
done
all
manner
of
things
to
in
the
oldest
way
,
at
her
coronation
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
they
did
her
good
.
  
<EOS>
She
soon
began
to
show
her
desire
to
put
down
the
Reformed
religion
,
and
put
up
the
unreformed
one
:
 
though
it
was
dangerous
work
as
yet
,
the
people
being
something
wiser
than
they
used
to
be
.
<EOS>
They
even
cast
a
shower
of
stones
---
and
among
them
a
dagger
---
at
one
of
the
royal
chaplains
who
attacked
the
Reformed
religion
in
a
public
sermon
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Queen
and
her
priests
went
steadily
on
.
<EOS>
Ridley
,
the
powerful
bishop
of
the
last
reign
,
was
seized
and
sent
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
LATIMER
,
also
celebrated
among
the
Clergy
of
the
last
reign
,
was
likewise
sent
to
the
Tower
,
and
Cranmer
speedily
followed
.
 
<EOS>
Latimer
was
an
aged
man
;
and
,
as
his
guards
took
him
through
Smithfield
,
he
looked
round
it
,
and
said
,
"
This
is
a
place
that
hath
long
groaned
for
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
For
he
knew
well
,
what
kind
of
bonfires
would
soon
be
burning
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
knowledge
confined
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisons
were
fast
filled
with
the
chief
Protestants
,
who
were
there
left
rotting
in
darkness
,
hunger
,
dirt
,
and
separation
from
their
friends
;
many
,
who
had
time
left
them
for
escape
,
fled
from
the
kingdom
;
and
the
dullest
of
the
people
began
,
now
,
to
see
what
was
coming
.
  
<EOS>
It
came
on
fast
.
 
<EOS>
A
Parliament
was
got
together
;
not
without
strong
suspicion
of
unfairness
;
and
they
annulled
the
divorce
,
formerly
pronounced
by
Cranmer
between
the
Queen
's
mother
and
King
Henry
the
Eighth
,
and
unmade
all
the
laws
on
the
subject
of
religion
that
had
been
made
in
the
last
King
Edward
's
reign
.
 
<EOS>
They
began
their
proceedings
,
in
violation
of
the
law
,
by
having
the
old
mass
said
before
them
in
Latin
,
and
by
turning
out
a
bishop
who
would
not
kneel
down
.
 
<EOS>
They
also
declared
guilty
of
treason
,
Lady
Jane
Grey
for
aspiring
to
the
Crown
;
her
husband
,
for
being
her
husband
;
and
Cranmer
,
for
not
believing
in
the
mass
aforesaid
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
prayed
the
Queen
graciously
to
choose
a
husband
for
herself
,
as
soon
as
might
be
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
question
who
should
be
the
Queen
's
husband
had
given
rise
to
a
great
deal
of
discussion
,
and
to
several
contending
parties
.
<EOS>
Some
said
Cardinal
Pole
was
the
man
---
but
the
Queen
was
of
opinion
that
he
was
NOT
the
man
,
he
being
too
old
and
too
much
of
a
student
.
 
<EOS>
Others
said
that
the
gallant
young
COURTENAY
,
whom
the
Queen
had
made
Earl
of
Devonshire
,
was
the
man
---
and
the
Queen
thought
so
too
,
for
a
while
;
but
she
changed
her
mind
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
it
appeared
that
PHILIP
,
PRINCE
OF
SPAIN
,
was
certainly
the
man
---
though
certainly
not
the
people
's
man
;
for
they
detested
the
idea
of
such
a
marriage
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
,
and
murmured
that
the
Spaniard
would
establish
in
England
,
by
the
aid
of
foreign
soldiers
,
the
worst
abuses
of
the
Popish
religion
,
and
even
the
terrible
Inquisition
itself
.
  
<EOS>
These
discontents
gave
rise
to
a
conspiracy
for
marrying
young
Courtenay
to
the
Princess
Elizabeth
,
and
setting
them
up
,
with
popular
tumults
all
over
the
kingdom
,
against
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
discovered
in
time
by
Gardiner
;
but
in
Kent
,
the
old
bold
county
,
the
people
rose
in
their
old
bold
way
.
 
<EOS>
SIR
THOMAS
WYAT
,
a
man
of
great
daring
,
was
their
leader
.
 
<EOS>
He
raised
his
standard
at
Maidstone
,
marched
on
to
Rochester
,
established
himself
in
the
old
castle
there
,
and
prepared
to
hold
out
against
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
,
who
came
against
him
with
a
party
of
the
Queen
's
guards
,
and
a
body
of
five
hundred
London
men
.
 
<EOS>
The
London
men
,
however
,
were
all
for
Elizabeth
,
and
not
at
all
for
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
They
declared
,
under
the
castle
walls
,
for
Wyat
;
the
Duke
retreated
;
and
Wyat
came
on
to
Deptford
,
at
the
head
of
fifteen
thousand
men
.
  
<EOS>
But
these
,
in
their
turn
,
fell
away
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
Southwark
,
there
were
only
two
thousand
left
.
 
<EOS>
Not
dismayed
by
finding
the
London
citizens
in
arms
,
and
the
guns
at
the
Tower
ready
to
oppose
his
crossing
the
river
there
,
Wyat
led
them
off
to
Kingston
-
upon
-
Thames
,
intending
to
cross
the
bridge
that
he
knew
to
be
in
that
place
,
and
so
to
work
his
way
round
to
Ludgate
,
one
of
the
old
gates
of
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
He
found
the
bridge
broken
down
,
but
mended
it
,
came
across
,
and
bravely
fought
his
way
up
Fleet
Street
to
Ludgate
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
the
gate
closed
against
him
,
he
fought
his
way
back
again
,
sword
in
hand
,
to
Temple
Bar
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
being
overpowered
,
he
surrendered
himself
,
and
three
or
four
hundred
of
his
men
were
taken
,
besides
a
hundred
killed
.
 
<EOS>
Wyat
,
in
a
moment
of
weakness
(
and
perhaps
of
torture
)
was
afterwards
made
to
accuse
the
Princess
Elizabeth
as
his
accomplice
to
some
very
small
extent
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
manhood
soon
returned
to
him
,
and
he
refused
to
save
his
life
by
making
any
more
false
confessions
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
quartered
and
distributed
in
the
usual
brutal
way
,
and
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
of
his
followers
were
hanged
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
were
led
out
,
with
halters
round
their
necks
,
to
be
pardoned
,
and
to
make
a
parade
of
crying
out
,
"
God
save
Queen
Mary
!
"
  
<EOS>
In
the
danger
of
this
rebellion
,
the
Queen
showed
herself
to
be
a
woman
of
courage
and
spirit
.
 
<EOS>
She
disdained
to
retreat
to
any
place
of
safety
,
and
went
down
to
the
Guildhall
,
sceptre
in
hand
,
and
made
a
gallant
speech
to
the
Lord
Mayor
and
citizens
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
the
day
after
Wyat
's
defeat
,
she
did
the
most
cruel
act
,
even
of
her
cruel
reign
,
in
signing
the
warrant
for
the
execution
of
Lady
Jane
Grey
.
  
<EOS>
They
tried
to
persuade
Lady
Jane
to
accept
the
unreformed
religion
;
but
she
steadily
refused
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
morning
when
she
was
to
die
,
she
saw
from
her
window
the
bleeding
and
headless
body
of
her
husband
brought
back
in
a
cart
from
the
scaffold
on
Tower
Hill
where
he
had
laid
down
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
she
had
declined
to
see
him
before
his
execution
,
lest
she
should
be
overpowered
and
not
make
a
good
end
,
so
,
she
even
now
showed
a
constancy
and
calmness
that
will
never
be
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
She
came
up
to
the
scaffold
with
a
firm
step
and
a
quiet
face
,
and
addressed
the
bystanders
in
a
steady
voice
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
numerous
;
for
she
was
too
young
,
too
innocent
and
fair
,
to
be
murdered
before
the
people
on
Tower
Hill
,
as
her
husband
had
just
been
;
so
,
the
place
of
her
execution
was
within
the
Tower
itself
.
 
<EOS>
She
said
that
she
had
done
an
unlawful
act
in
taking
what
was
<EOS>
Queen
Mary
's
right
;
but
that
she
had
done
so
with
no
bad
intent
,
and
that
she
died
a
humble
Christian
.
 
<EOS>
She
begged
the
executioner
to
despatch
her
quickly
,
and
she
asked
him
,
"
Will
you
take
my
head
off
before
I
lay
me
down
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
answered
,
"
No
,
Madam
,
"
<EOS>
and
then
she
was
very
quiet
while
they
bandaged
her
eyes
.
 
<EOS>
Being
blinded
,
and
unable
to
see
the
block
on
which
she
was
to
lay
her
young
head
,
she
was
seen
to
feel
about
for
it
with
her
hands
,
and
was
heard
to
say
,
confused
,
"
O
what
shall
I
do
!
 
<EOS>
Where
is
it
?
"
<EOS>
Then
they
guided
her
to
the
right
place
,
and
the
executioner
struck
off
her
head
.
 
<EOS>
You
know
<EOS>
too
well
,
now
,
what
dreadful
deeds
the
executioner
did
in
England
,
through
many
,
many
years
,
and
how
his
axe
descended
on
the
hateful
block
through
the
necks
of
some
of
the
bravest
,
wisest
,
and
best
in
the
land
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
never
struck
so
cruel
and
so
vile
a
blow
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
The
father
of
Lady
Jane
soon
followed
,
but
was
little
pitied
.
<EOS>
Queen
Mary
's
next
object
was
to
lay
hold
of
Elizabeth
,
and
this
was
pursued
with
great
eagerness
.
 
<EOS>
Five
hundred
men
were
sent
to
her
retired
house
at
Ashridge
,
by
Berkhampstead
,
with
orders
to
bring
her
up
,
alive
or
dead
.
 
<EOS>
They
got
there
at
ten
at
night
,
when
she
was
sick
in
bed
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
their
leaders
followed
her
lady
into
her
bedchamber
,
whence
she
was
brought
out
betimes
next
morning
,
and
put
into
a
litter
to
be
conveyed
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
so
weak
and
ill
,
that
she
was
five
days
on
the
road
;
still
,
she
was
so
resolved
to
be
seen
by
the
people
that
she
had
the
curtains
of
the
litter
opened
;
and
so
,
very
pale
and
sickly
,
passed
through
the
streets
.
<EOS>
She
wrote
to
her
sister
,
saying
she
was
innocent
of
any
crime
,
and
asking
why
she
was
made
a
prisoner
;
but
she
got
no
answer
,
and
was
ordered
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
They
took
her
in
by
the
Traitor
's
Gate
,
to
which
she
objected
,
but
in
vain
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
lords
who
conveyed
her
offered
to
cover
her
with
his
cloak
,
as
it
was
raining
,
but
she
put
it
away
from
her
,
proudly
and
scornfully
,
and
passed
into
the
Tower
,
and
sat
down
in
a
court
-
yard
on
a
stone
.
 
<EOS>
They
besought
her
to
come
in
out
of
the
wet
;
but
she
answered
that
it
was
better
sitting
there
,
than
in
a
worse
place
.
 
<EOS>
At
length
she
went
to
her
apartment
,
where
she
was
kept
a
prisoner
,
though
not
so
close
a
prisoner
as
at
Woodstock
,
whither
she
was
afterwards
removed
,
and
where
she
is
said
to
have
one
day
envied
a
milkmaid
whom
she
heard
singing
in
the
sunshine
as
she
went
through
the
green
fields
.
<EOS>
Gardiner
,
than
whom
there
were
not
many
worse
men
among
the
fierce
and
sullen
priests
,
cared
little
to
keep
secret
his
stern
desire
for
her
death
:
 
being
used
to
say
that
it
was
of
little
service
to
shake
off
the
leaves
,
and
lop
the
branches
of
the
tree
of
heresy
,
if
its
root
,
the
hope
of
heretics
,
were
left
.
 
<EOS>
He
failed
,
however
,
in
his
benevolent
design
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
was
,
at
length
,
released
;
and
Hatfield
House
was
assigned
to
her
as
a
residence
,
under
the
care
of
one
SIR
THOMAS
POPE
.
  
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
Philip
,
the
Prince
of
Spain
,
was
a
main
cause
of
this
change
in
Elizabeth
's
fortunes
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
an
amiable
man
,
being
,
on
the
contrary
,
proud
,
overbearing
,
and
gloomy
;
but
he
and
the
Spanish
lords
who
came
over
with
him
,
assuredly
did
discountenance
the
idea
of
doing
any
violence
to
the
Princess
.
 
<EOS>
It
may
have
been
mere
prudence
,
but
we
will
hope
it
was
manhood
and
honour
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
had
been
expecting
her
husband
with
great
impatience
,
and
at
length
he
came
,
to
her
great
joy
,
though
he
never
cared
much
for
her
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
married
by
Gardiner
,
at
Winchester
,
and
there
was
more
holiday
-
making
among
the
people
;
but
they
had
their
old
distrust
of
this
Spanish
marriage
,
in
which
even
the
Parliament
shared
.
 
<EOS>
Though
the
members
of
that
Parliament
were
far
from
honest
,
and
were
strongly
suspected
to
have
been
bought
with
Spanish
money
,
they
would
pass
no
bill
to
enable
the
Queen
to
set
aside
the
Princess
Elizabeth
and
appoint
her
own
successor
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Gardiner
failed
in
this
object
,
as
well
as
in
the
darker
one
of
bringing
the
Princess
to
the
scaffold
,
he
went
on
at
a
great
pace
in
the
revival
of
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
A
new
Parliament
was
packed
,
in
which
there
were
no
Protestants
.
 
<EOS>
Preparations
were
made
to
receive
Cardinal
Pole
in
England
as
the
Pope
's
messenger
,
bringing
his
holy
declaration
that
all
the
nobility
who
had
acquired
Church
property
,
should
keep
it
---
which
was
done
to
enlist
their
selfish
interest
on
the
Pope
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
Then
a
great
scene
was
enacted
,
which
was
the
triumph
of
the
Queen
's
plans
.
 
<EOS>
Cardinal
Pole
arrived
in
great
splendour
and
dignity
,
and
was
received
with
great
pomp
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
joined
in
a
petition
expressive
of
their
sorrow
at
the
change
in
the
national
religion
,
and
praying
him
to
receive
the
country
again
into
the
Popish
Church
.
 
<EOS>
With
the
Queen
sitting
on
her
throne
,
and
the
King
on
one
side
of
her
,
and
the
Cardinal
on
the
other
,
and
the
Parliament
present
,
Gardiner
read
the
petition
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
The
Cardinal
then
made
a
great
speech
,
and
was
so
obliging
as
to
say
that
all
was
forgotten
and
forgiven
,
and
that
the
kingdom
was
solemnly
made
Roman
Catholic
again
.
  
<EOS>
Everything
was
now
ready
for
the
lighting
of
the
terrible
bonfires
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
having
declared
to
the
Council
,
in
writing
,
that
she
would
wish
none
of
her
subjects
to
be
burnt
without
some
of
the
Council
being
present
,
and
that
she
would
particularly
wish
there
to
be
good
sermons
at
all
burnings
,
the
Council
knew
pretty
well
what
was
to
be
done
next
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
the
Cardinal
had
blessed
all
the
bishops
as
a
preface
to
the
burnings
,
the
Chancellor
Gardiner
opened
a
High
Court
at
Saint
Mary
Overy
,
on
the
Southwark
side
of
London
Bridge
,
for
the
trial
of
heretics
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
two
of
the
late
Protestant
clergymen
,
HOOPER
,
Bishop
of
Gloucester
,
and
ROGERS
,
a
Prebendary
of
St
Paul
's
,
were
brought
to
be
tried
.
 
<EOS>
Hooper
was
tried
first
for
being
married
,
though
a
priest
,
and
for
not
believing
in
the
mass
.
 
<EOS>
He
admitted
both
of
these
accusations
,
and
said
that
the
mass
was
a
wicked
imposition
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
tried
Rogers
,
who
said
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
two
were
brought
up
to
be
sentenced
;
and
then
Rogers
said
that
his
poor
wife
,
being
a
German
woman
and
a
stranger
in
the
land
,
he
hoped
might
be
allowed
to
come
to
speak
to
him
before
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
the
inhuman
Gardiner
replied
,
that
she
was
not
his
wife
.
 
<EOS>
"
Yea
,
but
she
is
,
my
lord
,
"
said
Rogers
,
"
and
<EOS>
she
hath
been
my
wife
these
eighteen
years
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
His
request
was
still
refused
,
and
they
were
both
sent
to
Newgate
;
all
those
who
stood
in
the
streets
to
sell
things
,
being
ordered
to
put
out
their
lights
that
the
people
might
not
see
them
.
<EOS>
But
,
the
people
stood
at
their
doors
with
candles
in
their
hands
,
and
prayed
for
them
as
they
went
by
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
Rogers
was
taken
out
of
jail
to
be
burnt
in
Smithfield
;
and
,
in
the
crowd
as
he
went
along
,
he
saw
his
poor
wife
and
his
ten
children
,
of
whom
the
youngest
was
a
little
baby
.
 
<EOS>
And
so
he
was
burnt
to
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
next
day
,
Hooper
,
who
was
to
be
burnt
at
Gloucester
,
was
brought
out
to
take
his
last
journey
,
and
was
made
to
wear
a
hood
over
his
face
that
he
might
not
be
known
by
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
they
did
know
him
for
all
that
,
down
in
his
own
part
of
the
country
;
and
,
when
he
came
near
Gloucester
,
they
lined
the
road
,
making
prayers
and
lamentations
.
 
<EOS>
His
guards
took
him
to
a
lodging
,
where
he
slept
soundly
all
night
.
 
<EOS>
At
nine
o'clock
next
morning
,
he
was
brought
forth
leaning
on
a
staff
;
for
he
had
taken
cold
in
prison
,
and
was
infirm
.
 
<EOS>
The
iron
stake
,
and
the
iron
chain
which
was
to
bind
him
to
it
,
were
fixed
up
near
a
great
elm
-
tree
in
a
pleasant
open
place
before
the
cathedral
,
where
,
on
peaceful
Sundays
,
he
had
been
accustomed
to
preach
and
to
pray
,
when
he
was
bishop
of
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
This
tree
,
which
had
no
leaves
then
,
it
being
February
,
was
filled
with
people
;
and
the
priests
of
Gloucester
College
were
looking
complacently
on
from
a
window
,
and
there
was
a
great
concourse
of
spectators
in
every
spot
from
which
a
glimpse
of
the
dreadful
sight
could
be
beheld
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
old
man
kneeled
down
on
the
small
platform
at
the
foot
of
the
stake
,
and
prayed
aloud
,
the
nearest
people
were
observed
to
be
so
attentive
to
his
prayers
that
they
were
ordered
to
stand
farther
back
;
for
it
did
not
suit
the
Romish
Church
to
have
those
Protestant
words
heard
.
 
<EOS>
His
prayers
concluded
,
he
went
up
to
the
stake
and
was
stripped
to
his
shirt
,
and
chained
ready
for
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
his
guards
had
such
compassion
on
him
that
,
to
shorten
his
agonies
,
he
tied
some
packets
of
gunpowder
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
heaped
up
wood
and
straw
and
reeds
,
and
set
them
all
alight
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
unhappily
,
the
wood
was
green
and
damp
,
and
there
was
a
wind
blowing
that
blew
what
flame
there
was
,
away
.
 
<EOS>
Thus
,
through
three
-
quarters
of
an
hour
,
the
good
old
man
was
scorched
and
roasted
and
smoked
,
as
the
fire
rose
and
sank
;
and
all
that
time
they
saw
him
,
as
he
burned
,
moving
his
lips
in
prayer
,
and
beating
his
breast
with
one
hand
,
even
after
the
other
was
burnt
away
and
had
fallen
off
.
  
<EOS>
Cranmer
,
Ridley
,
and
Latimer
,
were
taken
to
Oxford
to
dispute
with
a
commission
of
priests
and
doctors
about
the
mass
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
shamefully
treated
;
and
it
is
recorded
that
the
Oxford
scholars
hissed
and
howled
and
groaned
,
and
misconducted
themselves
in
an
anything
but
a
scholarly
way
.
 
<EOS>
The
prisoners
were
taken
back
to
jail
,
and
afterwards
tried
in
St
Mary
's
Church
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
all
found
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
sixteenth
of
the
month
of
October
,
Ridley
and
Latimer
were
brought
out
,
to
make
another
of
the
dreadful
bonfires
.
  
<EOS>
The
scene
of
the
suffering
of
these
two
good
Protestant
men
was
in
the
City
ditch
,
near
Baliol
College
.
 
<EOS>
On
coming
to
the
dreadful
spot
,
they
kissed
the
stakes
,
and
then
embraced
each
other
.
 
<EOS>
And
then
a
learned
doctor
got
up
into
a
pulpit
which
was
placed
there
,
and
preached
a
sermon
from
the
text
,
"
<EOS>
Though
I
give
my
body
to
be
burned
,
and
have
not
charity
,
it
profiteth
me
nothing
.
"
 
<EOS>
When
you
think
of
the
charity
of
burning
men
alive
,
you
may
imagine
that
this
learned
doctor
had
a
rather
brazen
face
.
 
<EOS>
Ridley
would
have
answered
his
sermon
when
it
came
to
an
end
,
but
was
not
allowed
.
<EOS>
When
Latimer
was
stripped
,
it
appeared
that
he
had
dressed
himself
under
his
other
clothes
,
in
a
new
shroud
;
and
,
as
he
stood
in
it
before
all
the
people
,
it
was
noted
of
him
,
and
long
remembered
,
that
,
whereas
he
had
been
stooping
and
feeble
but
a
few
minutes
before
,
he
now
stood
upright
and
handsome
,
in
the
knowledge
that
he
was
dying
for
a
just
and
a
great
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Ridley
's
brother
-
in
-
law
was
there
with
bags
of
gunpowder
;
and
when
they
were
both
chained
up
,
he
tied
them
round
their
bodies
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
light
was
thrown
upon
the
pile
to
fire
it
.
 
<EOS>
"
Be
of
good
comfort
,
Master
Ridley
,
"
said
Latimer
,
at
that
awful
moment
,
"
and
play
the
man
!
 
<EOS>
We
shall
this
day
light
such
a
candle
,
by
God
's
grace
,
in
England
,
as
I
trust
shall
never
be
put
out
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
then
he
was
seen
to
make
motions
with
his
hands
as
if
he
were
washing
them
in
the
flames
,
and
to
stroke
his
aged
face
with
them
,
and
was
heard
to
cry
,
"
Father
of
Heaven
,
receive
my
soul
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
died
quickly
,
but
the
fire
,
after
having
burned
the
legs
of
Ridley
,
sunk
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
lingered
,
chained
to
the
iron
post
,
and
crying
,
"
O
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
burn
!
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
for
Christ
's
sake
let
the
fire
come
unto
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
And
still
,
when
his
brother
-
in
-
law
had
heaped
on
more
wood
,
he
was
heard
through
the
blinding
smoke
,
still
dismally
crying
,
"
O
!
 
<EOS>
I
can
not
burn
,
I
can
not
burn
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
gunpowder
caught
fire
,
and
ended
his
miseries
.
  
<EOS>
Five
days
after
this
fearful
scene
,
Gardiner
went
to
his
tremendous
account
before
God
,
for
the
cruelties
he
had
so
much
assisted
in
committing
.
  
<EOS>
Cranmer
remained
still
alive
and
in
prison
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
brought
out
again
in
February
,
for
more
examining
and
trying
,
by
Bonner
,
Bishop
of
London
:
 
<EOS>
another
man
of
blood
,
who
had
succeeded
to
Gardiner
's
work
,
even
in
his
lifetime
,
when
Gardiner
was
tired
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
Cranmer
was
now
degraded
as
a
priest
,
and
left
for
death
;
but
,
if
the
Queen
hated
any
one
on
earth
,
she
hated
him
,
and
it
was
resolved
that
he
should
be
ruined
and
disgraced
to
the
utmost
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
doubt
that
the
Queen
and
her
husband
personally
urged
on
these
deeds
,
because
they
wrote
to
the
Council
,
urging
them
to
be
active
in
the
kindling
of
the
fearful
fires
.
 
<EOS>
As
Cranmer
was
known
not
to
be
a
firm
man
,
a
plan
was
laid
for
surrounding
him
with
artful
people
,
and
inducing
him
to
recant
to
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Deans
and
friars
visited
him
,
played
at
bowls
with
him
,
showed
him
various
attentions
,
talked
persuasively
with
him
,
gave
him
money
for
his
prison
comforts
,
and
induced
him
to
sign
,
I
fear
,
as
many
as
six
recantations
.
 
<EOS>
But
when
,
after
all
,
he
was
taken
out
to
be
burnt
,
he
was
nobly
true
to
his
better
self
,
and
made
a
glorious
end
.
  
<EOS>
After
prayers
and
a
sermon
,
Dr.
Cole
,
the
preacher
of
the
day
(
who
had
been
one
of
the
artful
priests
about
Cranmer
in
prison
)
,
required
him
to
make
a
public
confession
of
his
faith
before
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
Cole
did
,
expecting
that
he
would
declare
himself
a
Roman
Catholic
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
will
make
a
profession
of
my
faith
,
"
said
Cranmer
,
"
and
with
a
good
will
too
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Then
,
he
arose
before
them
all
,
and
took
from
the
sleeve
of
his
robe
a
written
prayer
and
read
it
aloud
.
 
<EOS>
That
done
,
he
kneeled
and
said
the
Lord
's
Prayer
,
all
the
people
joining
;
and
then
he
arose
again
and
told
them
that
he
believed
in
the
Bible
,
and
that
in
what
he
had
lately
written
,
he
had
written
what
was
not
the
truth
,
and
that
,
because
his
right
hand
had
signed
those
papers
,
he
would
burn
his
right
hand
first
when
he
came
to
the
fire
.
 
<EOS>
As
for
the
Pope
,
he
did
refuse
him
and
denounce
him
as
the
enemy
of
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
Hereupon
the
pious
Dr.
Cole
cried
out
to
the
guards
to
stop
that
heretic
's
mouth
and
take
him
away
.
  
<EOS>
So
they
took
him
away
,
and
chained
him
to
the
stake
,
where
he
hastily
took
off
his
own
clothes
to
make
ready
for
the
flames
.
 
<EOS>
And
he
stood
before
the
people
with
a
bald
head
and
a
white
and
flowing
beard
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
firm
now
when
the
worst
was
come
,
that
he
again
declared
against
his
recantation
,
and
was
so
impressive
and
so
undismayed
,
that
a
certain
lord
,
who
was
one
of
the
directors
of
the
execution
,
called
out
to
the
men
to
make
haste
!
 
<EOS>
When
the
fire
was
lighted
,
Cranmer
,
true
to
his
latest
word
,
stretched
out
his
right
hand
,
and
crying
out
,
"
This
hand
hath
offended
!
"
held
it
among
the
flames
,
until
it
blazed
and
burned
away
.
 
<EOS>
His
heart
was
found
entire
among
his
ashes
,
and
he
left
at
last
a
memorable
name
in
English
history
.
 
<EOS>
Cardinal
Pole
celebrated
the
day
by
saying
his
first
mass
,
and
next
day
he
was
made
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
in
Cranmer
's
place
.
  
<EOS>
The
Queen
's
husband
,
who
was
now
mostly
abroad
in
his
own
dominions
,
and
generally
made
a
coarse
jest
of
her
to
his
more
familiar
courtiers
,
was
at
war
with
France
,
and
came
over
to
seek
the
assistance
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
England
was
very
unwilling
to
engage
in
a
French
war
for
his
sake
;
but
it
happened
that
the
King
of
France
,
at
this
very
time
,
aided
a
descent
upon
the
English
coast
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
war
was
declared
,
greatly
to
Philip
's
satisfaction
;
and
the
Queen
raised
a
sum
of
money
with
which
to
carry
it
on
,
by
every
unjustifiable
means
in
her
power
.
 
<EOS>
It
met
with
no
profitable
return
,
for
the
French
Duke
of
Guise
surprised
Calais
,
and
the
English
sustained
a
complete
defeat
.
 
<EOS>
The
losses
they
met
with
in
France
greatly
mortified
the
national
pride
,
and
the
Queen
never
recovered
the
blow
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
bad
fever
raging
in
England
at
this
time
,
and
I
am
glad
to
write
that
the
Queen
took
it
,
and
the
hour
of
her
death
came
.
<EOS>
"
When
I
am
dead
and
my
body
is
opened
,
"
she
said
to
those
around
those
around
her
,
"
ye
shall
find
CALAIS
written
on
my
heart
.
"
 
<EOS>
I
should
have
thought
,
if
anything
were
written
on
it
,
they
would
have
found
the
words
---
JANE
GREY
,
HOOPER
,
ROGERS
,
RIDLEY
,
LATIMER
,
CRANMER
,
AND
THREE
HUNDRED
<EOS>
PEOPLE
<EOS>
BURNT
ALIVE
WITHIN
FOUR
YEARS
OF
MY
WICKED
REIGN
,
INCLUDING
SIXTY
WOMEN
AND
FORTY
<EOS>
LITTLE
CHILDREN
.
<EOS>
But
it
is
enough
that
their
deaths
were
written
in
Heaven
.
  
<EOS>
The
Queen
died
on
the
seventeenth
of
November
,
fifteen
hundred
and
fifty
-
eight
,
after
reigning
not
quite
five
years
and
a
half
,
and
in
the
forty
-
fourth
year
of
her
age
.
 
<EOS>
Cardinal
Pole
died
of
the
same
fever
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
As
BLOODY
QUEEN
MARY
,
this
woman
has
become
famous
,
and
as
BLOODY
QUEEN
MARY
,
she
will
ever
be
justly
remembered
with
horror
and
detestation
in
Great
Britain
.
 
<EOS>
Her
memory
has
been
held
in
such
abhorrence
that
some
writers
have
arisen
in
later
years
to
take
her
part
,
and
to
show
that
she
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
quite
an
amiable
and
cheerful
sovereign
!
 
<EOS>
"
By
their
fruits
ye
shall
know
them
,
"
said
OUR
SAVIOUR
.
 
<EOS>
The
stake
and
the
fire
were
the
fruits
of
this
reign
,
and
you
will
judge
this
Queen
by
nothing
else
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Elizabeth
    
THERE
was
great
rejoicing
all
over
the
land
when
the
Lords
of
the
Council
went
down
to
Hatfield
,
to
hail
the
Princess
Elizabeth
as
the
new
Queen
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Weary
of
the
barbarities
of
Mary
's
reign
,
the
people
looked
with
hope
and
gladness
to
the
new
Sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
The
nation
seemed
to
wake
from
a
horrible
dream
;
and
Heaven
,
so
long
hidden
by
the
smoke
of
the
fires
that
roasted
men
and
women
to
death
,
appeared
to
brighten
once
more
.
  
<EOS>
Queen
Elizabeth
was
five
-
and
-
twenty
years
of
age
when
she
rode
through
the
streets
of
London
,
from
the
Tower
to
Westminster
Abbey
,
to
be
crowned
.
 
<EOS>
Her
countenance
was
strongly
marked
,
but
on
the
whole
,
commanding
and
dignified
;
her
hair
was
red
,
and
her
nose
something
too
long
and
sharp
for
a
woman
's
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
not
the
beautiful
creature
her
courtiers
made
out
;
but
she
was
well
enough
,
and
no
doubt
looked
all
the
better
for
coming
after
the
dark
and
gloomy
Mary
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
well
educated
,
but
a
roundabout
writer
,
and
rather
a
hard
swearer
and
coarse
talker
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
clever
,
but
cunning
and
deceitful
,
and
inherited
much
of
her
father
's
violent
temper
.
 
<EOS>
I
mention
this
now
,
because
she
has
been
so
over
-
praised
by
one
party
,
and
so
over
-
abused
by
another
,
that
it
is
hardly
possible
to
understand
the
greater
part
of
her
reign
without
first
understanding
what
kind
of
woman
she
really
was
.
  
<EOS>
She
began
her
reign
with
the
great
advantage
of
having
a
very
wise
and
careful
Minister
,
SIR
WILLIAM
CECIL
,
whom
she
afterwards
made
LORD
BURLEIGH
.
 
<EOS>
Altogether
,
the
people
had
greater
reason
for
rejoicing
than
they
usually
had
,
when
there
were
processions
in
the
streets
;
and
they
were
happy
with
some
reason
.
 
<EOS>
All
kinds
of
shows
and
images
were
set
up
;
GOG
and
MAGOG
were
hoisted
to
the
top
of
Temple
Bar
,
and
(
which
was
more
to
the
purpose
)
<EOS>
the
Corporation
dutifully
presented
the
young
Queen
with
the
sum
of
a
thousand
marks
in
gold
---
so
heavy
a
present
,
that
she
was
obliged
to
take
it
into
her
carriage
with
both
hands
.
 
<EOS>
The
coronation
was
a
great
success
;
and
,
on
the
next
day
,
one
of
the
courtiers
presented
a
petition
to
the
new
Queen
,
praying
that
as
it
was
the
custom
to
release
some
prisoners
on
such
occasions
,
she
would
have
the
goodness
to
release
the
four
Evangelists
,
Matthew
,
Mark
,
Luke
,
and
John
,
and
also
the
Apostle
Saint
Paul
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
shut
up
in
a
strange
language
so
that
the
people
could
not
get
at
them
.
  
<EOS>
To
this
,
the
Queen
replied
that
it
would
be
better
first
to
inquire
of
themselves
whether
they
desired
to
be
released
or
not
;
and
,
as
a
means
of
finding
out
,
a
great
public
discussion
---
a
sort
of
religious
tournament
---
was
appointed
to
take
place
between
certain
champions
of
the
two
religions
,
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
You
may
suppose
that
it
was
soon
made
pretty
clear
to
common
sense
,
that
for
people
to
benefit
by
what
they
repeat
or
read
,
it
is
rather
necessary
they
should
understand
something
about
it
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
a
Church
Service
in
plain
English
was
settled
,
and
other
laws
and
regulations
were
made
,
completely
establishing
the
great
work
of
the
Reformation
.
 
<EOS>
The
Romish
bishops
and
champions
were
not
harshly
dealt
with
,
all
things
considered
;
and
the
Queen
's
Ministers
were
both
prudent
and
merciful
.
  
<EOS>
The
one
great
trouble
of
this
reign
,
and
the
unfortunate
cause
of
the
greater
part
of
such
turmoil
and
bloodshed
as
occurred
in
it
,
was
MARY
STUART
,
QUEEN
OF
SCOTS
.
 
<EOS>
We
will
try
to
understand
,
in
as
few
words
as
possible
,
who
Mary
was
,
what
she
was
,
and
how
she
came
to
be
a
thorn
in
the
royal
pillow
of
Elizabeth
.
  
<EOS>
She
was
the
daughter
of
the
Queen
Regent
of
Scotland
,
MARY
OF
GUISE
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
been
married
,
when
a
mere
child
,
to
the
Dauphin
,
the
son
and
heir
of
the
King
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
The
Pope
,
who
pretended
that
no
one
could
rightfully
wear
the
crown
of
England
without
his
gracious
permission
,
was
strongly
opposed
to
Elizabeth
,
who
had
not
asked
for
the
said
gracious
permission
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
would
have
inherited
the
English
crown
in
right
of
her
birth
,
supposing
the
English
Parliament
not
to
have
altered
the
succession
,
the
Pope
himself
,
and
most
of
the
discontented
who
were
followers
of
his
,
maintained
that
Mary
was
the
rightful
Queen
of
England
,
and
Elizabeth
the
wrongful
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
being
so
closely
connected
with
France
,
and
France
being
jealous
of
England
<EOS>
,
there
was
far
greater
danger
in
this
than
there
would
have
been
if
she
had
had
no
alliance
with
that
great
power
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
her
young
husband
,
on
the
death
of
his
father
,
became
FRANCIS
THE
SECOND
,
King
of
France
,
the
matter
grew
very
serious
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
young
couple
styled
themselves
King
and
Queen
of
England
,
and
the
Pope
was
disposed
to
help
them
by
doing
all
the
mischief
he
could
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
reformed
religion
,
under
the
guidance
of
a
stern
and
powerful
preacher
,
named
JOHN
KNOX
,
and
other
such
men
,
had
been
making
fierce
progress
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
still
a
half
savage
country
,
where
there
was
a
great
deal
of
murdering
and
rioting
continually
going
on
;
and
the
Reformers
,
instead
of
reforming
those
evils
as
they
should
have
done
<EOS>
,
went
to
work
in
the
ferocious
old
Scottish
spirit
,
laying
churches
and
chapels
waste
,
pulling
down
pictures
and
altars
,
and
knocking
about
the
Grey
Friars
,
and
the
Black
Friars
,
and
the
White
Friars
,
and
the
friars
of
all
sorts
of
colours
,
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
This
obdurate
and
harsh
spirit
of
the
Scottish
Reformers
<EOS>
(
the
Scotch
have
always
been
rather
a
sullen
and
frowning
people
in
religious
matters
)
<EOS>
put
up
the
blood
of
the
Romish
French
court
,
and
caused
France
to
send
troops
over
to
Scotland
,
with
the
hope
of
setting
the
friars
of
all
sorts
of
colours
on
their
legs
again
;
of
conquering
that
country
first
,
and
England
afterwards
;
and
so
crushing
the
Reformation
all
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
The
Scottish
Reformers
,
who
had
formed
a
great
league
which
they
called
The
Congregation
of
the
Lord
,
secretly
represented
to
Elizabeth
that
,
if
the
reformed
religion
got
the
worst
of
it
with
them
,
it
would
be
likely
to
get
the
worst
of
it
in
England
too
;
and
thus
,
Elizabeth
,
though
she
had
a
high
notion
of
the
rights
of
Kings
and
Queens
to
do
anything
they
liked
,
sent
an
army
to
Scotland
to
support
the
Reformers
,
who
were
in
arms
against
their
sovereign
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
proceedings
led
to
a
treaty
of
peace
at
Edinburgh
,
under
which
the
French
consented
to
depart
from
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
By
a
separate
treaty
,
Mary
and
her
young
husband
engaged
to
renounce
their
assumed
title
of
King
and
Queen
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
treaty
they
never
fulfilled
.
  
<EOS>
It
happened
,
soon
after
matters
had
got
to
this
state
,
that
the
young
French
King
died
,
leaving
Mary
a
young
widow
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
then
invited
by
her
Scottish
subjects
to
return
home
and
reign
over
them
;
and
as
she
was
not
now
happy
where
she
was
,
she
,
after
a
little
time
,
complied
.
  
<EOS>
Elizabeth
had
been
Queen
three
years
,
when
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
embarked
at
Calais
for
her
own
rough
,
quarrelling
country
.
 
<EOS>
As
she
came
out
of
the
harbour
,
a
vessel
was
lost
before
her
eyes
,
and
she
said
,
"
O
!
<EOS>
good
God
!
<EOS>
what
an
omen
this
is
for
such
a
voyage
!
"
 
<EOS>
She
was
very
fond
of
France
,
and
sat
on
the
deck
,
looking
back
at
it
and
weeping
,
until
it
was
quite
dark
.
 
<EOS>
When
she
went
to
bed
,
she
directed
to
be
called
at
daybreak
,
if
the
French
coast
were
still
visible
,
that
she
might
behold
it
for
the
last
time
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
proved
to
be
a
clear
morning
,
this
was
done
,
and
she
again
wept
for
the
country
she
was
leaving
,
and
said
many
times
,
"
Farewell
,
France
!
<EOS>
Farewell
,
France
!
 
<EOS>
I
shall
never
see
thee
again
!
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
long
remembered
afterwards
,
as
sorrowful
and
interesting
in
a
fair
young
princess
of
nineteen
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
afraid
it
gradually
came
,
together
with
her
other
distresses
,
to
surround
her
with
greater
sympathy
than
she
deserved
.
  
<EOS>
When
she
came
to
Scotland
,
and
took
up
her
abode
at
the
palace
of
Holyrood
in
Edinburgh
,
she
found
herself
among
uncouth
strangers
and
wild
uncomfortable
customs
very
different
from
her
experiences
in
the
court
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
people
who
were
disposed
to
love
her
,
made
her
head
ache
when
she
was
tired
out
by
her
voyage
,
with
a
serenade
of
discordant
music
---
a
fearful
concert
of
bagpipes
,
I
suppose
---
and
brought
her
and
her
train
home
to
her
palace
on
miserable
little
Scotch
horses
that
appeared
to
be
half
starved
.
<EOS>
Among
the
people
who
were
not
disposed
to
love
her
,
she
found
the
powerful
leaders
of
the
Reformed
Church
,
who
were
bitter
upon
her
amusements
,
however
innocent
,
and
denounced
music
and
dancing
as
works
of
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
John
Knox
himself
often
lectured
her
,
violently
and
angrily
,
and
did
much
to
make
her
life
unhappy
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
reasons
confirmed
her
old
attachment
to
the
Romish
religion
,
and
caused
her
,
there
is
no
doubt
,
most
imprudently
and
dangerously
both
for
herself
and
for
England
too
,
to
give
a
solemn
pledge
to
the
heads
of
the
Romish
Church
that
if
she
ever
succeeded
to
the
English
crown
,
she
would
set
up
that
religion
again
.
 
<EOS>
In
reading
her
unhappy
history
,
you
must
always
remember
this
;
and
also
that
during
her
whole
life
she
was
constantly
put
forward
against
the
Queen
,
in
some
form
or
other
,
by
the
Romish
party
.
  
<EOS>
That
Elizabeth
,
on
the
other
hand
,
was
not
inclined
to
like
her
,
is
pretty
certain
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
was
very
vain
and
jealous
,
and
had
an
extraordinary
dislike
to
people
being
married
.
 
<EOS>
She
treated
Lady
Catherine
Grey
,
sister
of
the
beheaded
Lady
Jane
,
with
such
shameful
severity
,
for
no
other
reason
than
her
being
secretly
married
,
that
she
died
and
her
husband
was
ruined
;
so
,
when
a
second
marriage
for
Mary
began
to
be
talked
about
,
probably
Elizabeth
disliked
her
more
.
 
<EOS>
Not
that
Elizabeth
wanted
suitors
of
her
own
,
for
they
started
up
from
Spain
,
Austria
,
Sweden
,
and
England
.
 
<EOS>
Her
English
lover
at
this
time
,
and
one
whom
she
much
favoured
too
,
was
LORD
ROBERT
DUDLEY
,
Earl
of
Leicester
---
himself
secretly
married
to
AMY
ROBSART
,
the
daughter
of
an
English
gentleman
,
whom
he
was
strongly
suspected
of
causing
to
be
murdered
,
down
at
his
country
seat
,
Cumnor
Hall
in
Berkshire
,
that
he
might
be
free
to
marry
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
story
,
the
great
writer
,
SIR
WALTER
SCOTT
,
has
founded
one
of
his
best
romances
.
<EOS>
But
if
Elizabeth
knew
how
to
lead
her
handsome
favourite
on
,
for
her
own
vanity
and
pleasure
,
she
knew
how
to
stop
him
for
her
own
pride
;
and
his
love
,
and
all
the
other
proposals
,
came
to
nothing
.
<EOS>
The
Queen
always
declared
in
good
set
speeches
,
that
she
would
never
be
married
at
all
,
but
would
live
and
die
a
Maiden
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
very
pleasant
and
meritorious
declaration
,
I
suppose
;
but
it
has
been
puffed
and
trumpeted
so
much
,
that
I
am
rather
tired
of
it
myself
.
  
<EOS>
Divers
princes
proposed
to
marry
Mary
,
but
the
English
court
had
reasons
for
being
jealous
of
them
all
,
and
even
proposed
as
a
matter
of
policy
that
she
should
marry
that
very
Earl
of
Leicester
who
had
aspired
to
be
the
husband
of
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
LORD
DARNLEY
,
son
of
the
Earl
of
Lennox
,
and
himself
descended
from
the
Royal
Family
of
Scotland
,
went
over
with
Elizabeth
's
consent
to
try
his
fortune
at
Holyrood
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
tall
simpleton
;
and
could
dance
and
play
the
guitar
;
but
I
know
of
nothing
else
he
could
do
,
unless
it
were
to
get
very
drunk
,
and
eat
gluttonously
,
and
make
a
contemptible
spectacle
of
himself
in
many
mean
and
vain
ways
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
gained
Mary
's
heart
,
not
disdaining
in
the
pursuit
of
his
object
to
ally
himself
with
one
of
her
secretaries
,
DAVID
RIZZIO
,
who
had
great
influence
with
her
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
married
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
This
marriage
does
not
say
much
for
her
,
but
what
followed
will
presently
say
less
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
's
brother
,
the
EARL
OF
MURRAY
,
and
head
of
the
Protestant
party
in
Scotland
,
had
opposed
this
marriage
,
partly
on
religious
grounds
,
and
partly
perhaps
from
personal
dislike
of
the
very
contemptible
bridegroom
.
 
<EOS>
When
it
had
taken
place
,
through
Mary
's
gaining
over
to
it
the
more
powerful
of
the
lords
about
her
,
she
banished
Murray
for
his
pains
;
and
,
when
he
and
some
other
nobles
rose
in
arms
to
support
the
reformed
religion
,
she
herself
,
within
a
month
of
her
wedding
day
,
rode
against
them
in
armour
with
loaded
pistols
in
her
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
Driven
out
of
Scotland
,
they
presented
themselves
before
Elizabeth
---
who
called
them
traitors
in
public
,
and
assisted
them
in
private
,
according
to
her
crafty
nature
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
had
been
married
but
a
little
while
,
when
she
began
to
hate
her
husband
,
who
,
in
his
turn
,
began
to
hate
that
David
Rizzio
,
with
whom
he
had
leagued
to
gain
her
favour
,
and
whom
he
now
believed
to
be
her
lover
.
 
<EOS>
He
hated
Rizzio
to
that
extent
,
that
he
made
a
compact
with
LORD
RUTHVEN
and
three
other
lords
to
get
rid
of
him
by
murder
.
 
<EOS>
This
wicked
agreement
they
made
in
solemn
secrecy
upon
the
first
of
March
,
fifteen
hundred
and
sixty
-
six
,
and
on
the
night
of
Saturday
the
ninth
,
the
conspirators
were
brought
by
Darnley
up
a
private
staircase
,
dark
and
steep
,
into
a
range
of
rooms
where
they
knew
that
Mary
was
sitting
at
supper
with
her
sister
,
Lady
Argyle
,
and
this
doomed
man
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
went
into
the
room
,
Darnley
took
the
Queen
round
the
waist
,
and
Lord
Ruthven
,
who
had
risen
from
a
bed
of
sickness
to
do
this
murder
,
came
in
,
gaunt
and
ghastly
,
leaning
on
two
men
.
 
<EOS>
Rizzio
ran
behind
the
Queen
for
shelter
and
protection
.
 
<EOS>
"
Let
him
come
out
of
the
room
,
"
said
Ruthven
.
 
<EOS>
"
He
shall
not
leave
the
room
,
"
replied
the
Queen
;
"
I
read
his
danger
in
your
face
,
and
it
is
my
will
that
he
remain
here
.
<EOS>
"
They
then
set
upon
him
,
struggled
with
him
,
overturned
the
table
,
dragged
him
out
,
and
killed
him
with
fifty
-
six
stabs
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Queen
heard
that
he
was
dead
,
she
said
,
"
No
more
tears
.
 
<EOS>
I
will
think
now
of
revenge
!
"
  
<EOS>
Within
a
day
or
two
,
she
gained
her
husband
over
,
and
prevailed
on
the
tall
idiot
to
abandon
the
conspirators
and
fly
with
her
to
Dunbar
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
issued
a
proclamation
,
audaciously
and
falsely
denying
that
he
had
any
knowledge
of
the
late
bloody
business
;
and
there
they
were
joined
by
the
EARL
BOTHWELL
and
some
other
nobles
.
<EOS>
With
their
help
,
they
raised
eight
thousand
men
;
returned
to
Edinburgh
,
and
drove
the
assassins
into
England
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
soon
afterwards
gave
birth
to
a
son
---
still
thinking
of
revenge
.
  
<EOS>
That
she
should
have
had
a
greater
scorn
for
her
husband
after
his
late
cowardice
and
treachery
than
she
had
had
before
,
was
natural
enough
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
little
doubt
that
she
now
began
to
love
Bothwell
instead
,
and
to
plan
with
him
means
of
getting
rid
of
Darnley
.
<EOS>
Bothwell
had
such
power
over
her
that
he
induced
her
even
to
pardon
the
assassins
of
Rizzio
.
 
<EOS>
The
arrangements
for
the
Christening
of
the
young
Prince
were
entrusted
to
him
,
and
he
was
one
of
the
most
important
people
at
the
ceremony
,
where
the
child
was
named
JAMES
:
<EOS>
Elizabeth
being
his
godmother
,
though
not
present
on
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
A
week
afterwards
,
Darnley
,
who
had
left
Mary
and
gone
to
his
father
's
house
at
Glasgow
,
being
taken
ill
with
the
small
-
pox
,
she
sent
her
own
physician
to
attend
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
there
is
reason
to
apprehend
that
this
was
merely
a
show
and
a
pretence
,
and
that
she
knew
what
was
doing
,
when
Bothwell
within
another
month
proposed
to
one
of
the
late
conspirators
against
Rizzio
,
to
murder
Darnley
,
"
for
that
it
was
the
Queen
's
mind
that
he
should
be
taken
away
.
<EOS>
"
It
is
certain
that
on
that
very
day
she
wrote
to
her
ambassador
in
France
,
complaining
of
him
,
and
yet
went
immediately
to
Glasgow
,
feigning
to
be
very
anxious
about
him
,
and
to
love
him
very
much
.
<EOS>
If
she
wanted
to
get
him
in
her
power
,
she
succeeded
to
her
heart
's
content
;
for
she
induced
him
to
go
back
with
her
to
Edinburgh
,
and
to
occupy
,
instead
of
the
palace
,
a
lone
house
outside
the
city
called
the
Kirk
of
Field
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
he
lived
for
about
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
One
Sunday
night
,
she
remained
with
him
until
ten
o'clock
,
and
then
left
him
,
to
go
to
Holyrood
to
be
present
at
an
entertainment
given
in
celebration
of
the
marriage
of
one
of
her
favourite
servants
.
<EOS>
At
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
the
city
was
shaken
by
a
great
explosion
,
and
the
Kirk
of
Field
was
blown
to
atoms
.
  
<EOS>
Darnley
's
body
was
found
next
day
lying
under
a
tree
at
some
distance
.
 
<EOS>
How
it
came
there
,
undisfigured
and
unscorched
by
gunpowder
,
and
how
this
crime
came
to
be
so
clumsily
and
strangely
committed
,
it
is
impossible
to
discover
.
 
<EOS>
The
deceitful
character
of
Mary
,
and
the
deceitful
character
of
Elizabeth
,
have
rendered
almost
every
part
of
their
joint
history
uncertain
and
obscure
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
fear
that
Mary
was
unquestionably
a
party
to
her
husband
's
murder
,
and
that
this
was
the
revenge
she
had
threatened
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scotch
people
universally
believed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Voices
cried
out
in
the
streets
of
Edinburgh
in
the
dead
of
the
night
,
for
justice
on
the
murderess
.
 
<EOS>
Placards
were
posted
by
unknown
hands
in
the
public
places
denouncing
Bothwell
as
the
murderer
,
and
the
Queen
as
his
accomplice
;
and
,
when
he
afterwards
married
her
(
though
himself
already
married
)
,
previously
making
a
show
of
taking
her
prisoner
by
force
,
the
indignation
of
the
people
knew
no
bounds
.
 
<EOS>
The
women
particularly
are
described
as
having
been
quite
frantic
against
the
Queen
,
and
to
have
hooted
and
cried
after
her
in
the
streets
with
terrific
vehemence
.
  
<EOS>
Such
guilty
unions
seldom
prosper
.
 
<EOS>
This
husband
and
wife
had
lived
together
but
<EOS>
a
month
,
when
they
were
separated
for
ever
by
the
successes
of
a
band
of
Scotch
nobles
who
associated
against
them
for
the
protection
of
the
young
Prince
:
 
whom
Bothwell
had
vainly
endeavoured
to
lay
hold
of
,
and
whom
he
would
certainly
have
murdered
,
if
the
EARL
OF
MAR
,
in
whose
hands
the
boy
was
,
had
not
been
firmly
and
honourably
faithful
to
his
trust
.
 
<EOS>
Before
this
angry
power
,
Bothwell
fled
abroad
,
where
he
died
,
a
prisoner
and
mad
,
nine
miserable
years
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
Mary
being
found
by
the
associated
lords
to
deceive
them
at
every
turn
,
was
sent
a
prisoner
to
Lochleven
Castle
;
which
,
as
it
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
lake
,
could
only
be
approached
by
boat
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
one
LORD
LINDSAY
,
who
was
so
much
of
a
brute
that
the
nobles
would
have
done
better
if
they
had
chosen
a
mere
gentleman
for
their
messenger
,
made
her
sign
her
abdication
,
and
appoint
Murray
,
Regent
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
too
,
Murray
saw
her
in
a
sorrowing
and
humbled
state
.
  
<EOS>
She
had
better
have
remained
in
the
castle
of
Lochleven
,
dull
prison
as
it
was
,
with
the
rippling
of
the
lake
against
it
,
and
the
moving
shadows
of
the
water
on
the
room
walls
;
but
she
could
not
rest
there
,
and
more
than
once
tried
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
time
she
had
nearly
succeeded
,
dressed
in
the
clothes
of
her
own
washer
-
woman
,
but
,
putting
up
her
hand
to
prevent
one
of
the
boatmen
from
lifting
her
veil
,
the
men
suspected
her
,
seeing
how
white
it
was
,
and
rowed
her
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
A
short
time
afterwards
,
her
fascinating
manners
enlisted
in
her
cause
a
boy
in
the
Castle
,
called
the
little
DOUGLAS
,
who
,
while
the
family
were
at
supper
,
stole
the
keys
of
the
great
gate
,
went
softly
out
with
the
Queen
,
locked
the
gate
on
the
outside
,
and
rowed
her
away
across
the
lake
,
sinking
the
keys
as
they
went
along
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
opposite
shore
she
was
met
by
another
Douglas
,
and
some
few
lords
;
and
,
so
accompanied
,
rode
away
on
horseback
to
Hamilton
,
where
they
raised
three
thousand
men
.
<EOS>
Here
,
she
issued
a
proclamation
declaring
that
the
abdication
she
had
signed
in
her
prison
was
illegal
,
and
requiring
the
Regent
to
yield
to
his
lawful
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Being
a
steady
soldier
,
and
in
no
way
discomposed
although
he
was
without
an
army
,
Murray
pretended
to
treat
with
her
,
until
he
had
collected
a
force
about
half
equal
to
her
own
,
and
then
he
gave
her
battle
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
quarter
of
an
hour
he
cut
down
all
her
hopes
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
another
weary
ride
on
horse
-
back
of
sixty
long
Scotch
miles
,
and
took
shelter
at
Dundrennan
Abbey
,
whence
she
fled
for
safety
to
Elizabeth
's
dominions
.
  
<EOS>
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
came
to
England
---
to
her
own
ruin
,
the
trouble
of
the
kingdom
,
and
the
misery
and
death
of
many
---
in
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
sixty
-
eight
.
 
<EOS>
How
she
left
it
and
the
world
,
nineteen
years
afterwards
,
we
have
now
to
see
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
WHEN
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
arrived
in
England
,
without
money
and
even
without
any
other
clothes
than
those
she
wore
,
she
wrote
to
Elizabeth
,
representing
herself
as
an
innocent
and
injured
piece
of
Royalty
,
and
entreating
her
assistance
to
oblige
her
Scottish
subjects
to
take
her
back
again
and
obey
her
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
her
character
was
already
known
in
England
to
be
a
very
different
one
from
what
she
made
it
out
to
be
,
she
was
told
in
answer
that
she
must
first
clear
herself
.
 
<EOS>
Made
uneasy
by
this
condition
,
Mary
,
rather
than
stay
in
England
,
would
have
gone
to
Spain
,
or
to
France
,
or
would
even
have
gone
back
to
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
as
her
doing
either
would
have
been
likely
to
trouble
England
afresh
,
it
was
decided
that
she
should
be
detained
here
.
 
<EOS>
She
first
came
to
Carlisle
,
and
,
after
that
,
was
moved
about
from
castle
to
castle
,
as
was
considered
necessary
;
but
England
she
never
left
again
.
  
<EOS>
After
trying
very
hard
to
get
rid
of
the
necessity
of
clearing
herself
,
Mary
,
advised
by
LORD
HERRIES
,
her
best
friend
in
England
,
agreed
to
answer
the
charges
against
her
,
if
the
Scottish
noblemen
who
made
them
would
attend
to
maintain
them
before
such
English
noblemen
as
Elizabeth
might
appoint
for
that
purpose
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
such
an
assembly
,
under
the
name
of
a
conference
,
met
,
first
at
York
,
and
afterwards
at
Hampton
Court
.
 
<EOS>
In
its
presence
Lord
Lennox
,
Darnley
's
father
,
openly
charged
Mary
with
the
murder
of
his
son
;
and
whatever
Mary
's
friends
may
now
say
or
write
in
her
behalf
,
there
is
no
doubt
that
,
when
her
brother
Murray
produced
against
her
a
casket
containing
certain
guilty
letters
and
verses
which
he
stated
to
have
passed
between
her
and
Bothwell
,
she
withdrew
from
the
inquiry
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
it
is
to
be
supposed
that
she
was
then
considered
guilty
by
those
who
had
the
best
opportunities
of
judging
of
the
truth
,
and
that
the
feeling
which
afterwards
arose
in
her
behalf
was
a
very
generous
but
not
a
very
reasonable
one
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
the
DUKE
OF
NORFOLK
,
an
honourable
but
rather
weak
nobleman
,
partly
because
Mary
was
captivating
,
partly
because
he
was
ambitious
,
partly
because
he
was
over
-
persuaded
by
artful
plotters
against
Elizabeth
,
conceived
a
strong
idea
that
he
would
like
to
marry
the
Queen
of
Scots
---
though
he
was
a
little
frightened
,
too
,
by
the
letters
in
the
casket
.
 
<EOS>
This
idea
being
secretly
encouraged
by
some
of
the
noblemen
of
Elizabeth
's
court
,
and
even
by
the
favourite
Earl
of
Leicester
(
because
it
was
objected
to
by
other
favourites
who
were
his
rivals
)
,
Mary
expressed
her
approval
of
it
,
and
the
King
of
France
and
the
King
of
Spain
are
supposed
to
have
done
the
same
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
not
so
quietly
planned
,
though
,
but
that
it
came
to
Elizabeth
's
ears
,
who
warned
the
Duke
"
to
be
careful
what
sort
of
pillow
he
was
going
to
lay
his
head
upon
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
humble
reply
at
the
time
;
but
turned
sulky
soon
afterwards
,
and
,
being
considered
dangerous
,
was
sent
to
the
Tower
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
from
the
moment
of
Mary
's
coming
to
England
<EOS>
she
began
to
be
the
centre
of
plots
and
miseries
.
  
<EOS>
A
rise
of
the
Catholics
in
the
north
was
the
next
of
these
,
and
it
was
only
checked
by
many
executions
and
much
bloodshed
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
followed
by
a
great
conspiracy
of
the
Pope
and
some
of
the
Catholic
sovereigns
of
Europe
to
depose
Elizabeth
,
place
Mary
on
the
throne
,
and
restore
the
unreformed
religion
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
almost
impossible
to
doubt
that
Mary
knew
and
approved
of
this
;
and
the
Pope
himself
was
so
hot
in
the
matter
that
he
issued
a
bull
,
in
which
he
openly
called
Elizabeth
the
"
pretended
Queen
"
of
England
,
excommunicated
her
,
and
excommunicated
all
her
subjects
who
should
continue
to
obey
her
.
 
<EOS>
A
copy
of
this
miserable
paper
got
into
London
,
and
was
found
one
morning
publicly
posted
on
the
Bishop
of
London
's
gate
.
<EOS>
A
great
hue
and
cry
being
raised
<EOS>
,
another
copy
was
found
in
the
chamber
of
a
student
of
Lincoln
's
Inn
,
who
confessed
,
being
put
upon
the
rack
,
that
he
had
received
it
from
one
JOHN
FELTON
,
a
rich
gentleman
who
lived
across
the
Thames
,
near
Southwark
.
 
<EOS>
This
John
Felton
,
being
put
upon
the
rack
too
,
confessed
that
he
had
posted
the
placard
on
the
Bishop
's
gate
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
offence
he
was
,
within
four
days
,
taken
to
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
and
there
hanged
and
quartered
.
 
<EOS>
As
to
the
Pope
's
bull
,
the
people
by
the
reformation
having
thrown
off
the
Pope
,
did
not
care
much
,
you
may
suppose
,
for
the
Pope
's
throwing
off
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
mere
dirty
piece
of
paper
,
and
not
half
so
powerful
as
a
street
ballad
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
when
Felton
was
brought
to
his
trial
,
the
poor
Duke
of
Norfolk
was
released
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
well
for
him
if
he
had
kept
away
from
the
Tower
evermore
,
and
from
the
snares
that
had
taken
him
there
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
even
while
he
was
in
that
dismal
place
he
corresponded
with
Mary
,
and
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
it
,
he
began
to
plot
again
.
 
<EOS>
Being
discovered
in
correspondence
with
the
Pope
,
with
a
view
to
a
rising
in
England
which
should
force
Elizabeth
to
consent
to
his
marriage
with
Mary
and
to
repeal
the
laws
against
the
Catholics
,
he
was
re
-
committed
to
the
Tower
and
brought
to
trial
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
found
guilty
by
the
unanimous
verdict
of
the
Lords
who
tried
him
,
and
was
sentenced
to
the
block
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
very
difficult
to
make
out
,
at
this
distance
of
time
,
and
between
opposite
accounts
,
whether
Elizabeth
really
was
a
humane
woman
,
or
desired
to
appear
so
,
or
was
fearful
of
shedding
the
blood
of
people
of
great
name
who
were
popular
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Twice
she
commanded
and
countermanded
the
execution
of
this
Duke
,
and
it
did
not
take
place
until
five
months
after
his
trial
.
 
<EOS>
The
scaffold
was
erected
on
Tower
Hill
,
and
there
he
died
like
a
brave
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
refused
to
have
his
eyes
bandaged
,
saying
that
he
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
death
;
and
he
admitted
the
justice
of
his
sentence
,
and
was
much
regretted
by
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
Although
Mary
had
shrunk
at
the
most
important
time
from
disproving
her
guilt
,
she
was
very
careful
never
to
do
anything
that
would
admit
it
.
 
<EOS>
All
such
proposals
as
were
made
to
her
by
Elizabeth
for
her
release
,
required
that
admission
in
some
form
or
other
,
and
therefore
came
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
Moreover
,
both
women
being
artful
and
treacherous
,
and
neither
ever
trusting
the
other
,
it
was
not
likely
that
they
could
ever
make
an
agreement
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
Parliament
,
aggravated
by
what
the
Pope
had
done
,
made
new
and
strong
laws
against
the
spreading
of
the
Catholic
religion
in
England
,
and
declared
it
treason
in
any
one
to
say
that
the
Queen
and
her
successors
were
not
the
lawful
sovereigns
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
done
more
than
this
,
but
for
Elizabeth
's
moderation
.
  
<EOS>
Since
the
Reformation
,
there
had
come
to
be
three
great
sects
of
religious
people
---
or
people
who
called
themselves
so
---
in
England
;
that
is
to
say
,
those
who
belonged
to
the
Reformed
Church
,
those
who
belonged
to
the
Unreformed
Church
,
and
those
who
were
called
the
Puritans
,
because
they
said
that
they
wanted
to
have
everything
very
pure
and
plain
in
all
the
Church
service
.
 
<EOS>
These
last
were
for
the
most
part
an
uncomfortable
people
,
who
thought
it
highly
meritorious
to
dress
in
a
hideous
manner
,
talk
through
their
noses
,
and
oppose
all
harmless
enjoyments
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
were
powerful
too
,
and
very
much
in
earnest
,
and
they
were
one
and
all
the
determined
enemies
of
the
Queen
of
Scots
.
 
<EOS>
The
Protestant
feeling
in
England
was
further
strengthened
by
the
tremendous
cruelties
to
which
Protestants
were
exposed
in
France
and
in
the
Netherlands
.
 
<EOS>
Scores
of
thousands
of
them
were
put
to
death
in
those
countries
with
every
cruelty
that
can
be
imagined
,
and
at
last
,
in
the
autumn
of
the
year
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
seventy
-
two
,
one
of
the
greatest
barbarities
ever
committed
in
the
world
took
place
at
Paris
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
called
in
history
,
THE
MASSACRE
OF
SAINT
BARTHOLOMEW
,
because
it
took
place
on
Saint
Bartholomew
's
Eve
.
 
<EOS>
The
day
fell
on
Saturday
the
twenty
-
third
of
August
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
day
all
the
great
leaders
of
the
Protestants
(
who
were
there
called
HUGUENOTS
)
were
assembled
together
,
for
the
purpose
,
as
was
represented
to
them
,
of
doing
honour
to
the
marriage
of
their
chief
,
the
young
King
of
Navarre
,
with
the
sister
of
CHARLES
THE
NINTH
:
 
a
miserable
young
King
who
then
occupied
the
French
throne
.
 
<EOS>
This
dull
creature
was
made
to
believe
by
his
mother
and
other
fierce
Catholics
about
him
that
the
Huguenots
meant
to
take
his
life
;
and
he
was
persuaded
to
give
secret
orders
that
,
on
the
tolling
of
a
great
bell
,
they
should
be
fallen
upon
by
an
overpowering
force
of
armed
men
,
and
slaughtered
wherever
they
could
be
found
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
appointed
hour
was
close
at
hand
,
the
stupid
wretch
,
trembling
from
head
to
foot
,
was
taken
into
a
balcony
by
his
mother
to
see
the
atrocious
work
begun
.
 
<EOS>
The
moment
the
bell
tolled
,
the
murderers
broke
forth
.
 
<EOS>
During
all
that
night
and
the
two
next
days
,
they
broke
into
the
houses
,
fired
the
houses
,
shot
and
stabbed
the
Protestants
,
men
,
women
,
and
children
,
and
flung
their
bodies
into
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
shot
at
in
the
streets
as
they
passed
along
,
and
their
blood
ran
down
the
gutters
.
<EOS>
Upwards
of
ten
thousand
Protestants
were
killed
in
Paris
alone
;
in
all
France
four
or
five
times
that
number
.
 
<EOS>
To
return
thanks
to
Heaven
for
these
diabolical
murders
,
the
Pope
and
his
train
actually
went
in
public
procession
at
Rome
,
and
as
if
this
were
not
shame
enough
for
them
,
they
had
a
medal
struck
to
commemorate
the
event
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
however
comfortable
the
wholesale
murders
were
to
these
high
authorities
,
they
had
not
that
soothing
effect
upon
the
doll
-
King
.
 
<EOS>
I
am
happy
to
state
that
he
never
knew
a
moment
's
peace
afterwards
;
that
he
was
continually
crying
out
that
he
saw
the
Huguenots
covered
with
blood
and
wounds
falling
dead
before
him
;
and
that
he
died
within
a
year
,
shrieking
and
yelling
and
raving
to
that
degree
,
that
if
all
the
Popes
who
had
ever
lived
had
been
rolled
into
one
,
they
would
not
have
afforded
His
guilty
Majesty
the
slightest
consolation
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
terrible
news
of
the
massacre
arrived
in
England
,
it
made
a
powerful
impression
indeed
upon
the
people
.
 
<EOS>
If
they
began
to
run
a
little
wild
against
the
Catholics
at
about
this
time
,
this
fearful
reason
for
it
,
coming
so
soon
after
the
days
of
bloody
Queen
Mary
,
must
be
remembered
in
their
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
The
Court
was
not
quite
so
honest
as
the
people
---
but
perhaps
it
sometimes
is
not
.
<EOS>
It
received
the
French
ambassador
,
with
all
the
lords
and
ladies
dressed
in
deep
mourning
,
and
keeping
a
profound
silence
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
a
proposal
of
marriage
which
he
had
made
to
Elizabeth
only
two
days
before
the
eve
of
Saint
Bartholomew
,
on
behalf
of
the
Duke
of
Alenáon
,
the
French
King
's
brother
,
a
boy
of
seventeen
,
still
went
on
;
while
on
the
other
hand
,
in
her
usual
crafty
way
,
the
Queen
secretly
supplied
the
Huguenots
with
money
and
weapons
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
that
for
a
Queen
who
made
all
those
fine
speeches
,
of
which
I
have
confessed
myself
to
be
rather
tired
,
about
living
and
dying
a
Maiden
Queen
<EOS>
,
Elizabeth
was
"
going
"
to
be
married
pretty
often
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
always
having
some
English
favourite
or
other
whom
she
by
turns
encouraged
and
swore
at
and
knocked
about
---
for
the
maiden
Queen
was
very
free
with
her
fists
---
she
held
this
French
Duke
off
and
on
through
several
years
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
at
last
came
over
to
England
,
the
marriage
articles
were
actually
drawn
up
,
and
it
was
settled
that
the
wedding
should
take
place
in
six
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
was
then
so
bent
upon
it
,
that
she
prosecuted
a
poor
Puritan
named
STUBBS
,
and
a
poor
bookseller
named
PAGE
,
for
writing
and
publishing
a
pamphlet
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
Their
right
hands
were
chopped
off
for
this
crime
;
and
poor
Stubbs
---
more
loyal
than
I
should
have
been
myself
under
the
circumstances
---
immediately
pulled
off
his
hat
with
his
left
hand
,
and
cried
,
"
God
save
the
Queen
!
"
 
<EOS>
Stubbs
was
cruelly
treated
;
for
the
marriage
never
took
place
after
all
,
though
the
Queen
pledged
herself
to
the
Duke
with
a
ring
from
her
own
finger
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
away
,
no
better
than
he
came
,
when
the
courtship
had
lasted
some
ten
years
altogether
;
and
he
died
a
couple
of
years
afterwards
,
mourned
by
Elizabeth
,
who
appears
to
have
been
really
fond
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
not
much
to
her
credit
,
for
he
was
a
bad
enough
member
of
a
bad
family
.
  
<EOS>
To
return
to
the
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
There
arose
two
orders
of
priests
,
who
were
very
busy
in
England
,
and
who
were
much
dreaded
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
the
JESUITS
(
who
were
everywhere
in
all
sorts
of
disguises
)
,
and
the
SEMINARY
PRIESTS
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
had
a
great
horror
of
the
first
,
because
they
were
known
to
have
taught
that
murder
was
lawful
if
it
were
done
with
an
object
of
which
they
approved
;
and
they
had
a
great
horror
of
the
second
,
because
they
came
to
teach
the
old
religion
,
and
to
be
the
successors
of
"
Queen
Mary
's
priests
,
"
as
those
yet
lingering
in
England
were
called
,
when
they
should
die
out
.
 
<EOS>
The
severest
laws
were
made
against
them
,
and
were
most
unmercifully
executed
.
 
<EOS>
Those
who
sheltered
them
in
their
houses
often
suffered
heavily
for
what
was
an
act
of
humanity
;
and
the
rack
,
that
cruel
torture
which
tore
men
's
limbs
asunder
,
was
constantly
kept
going
.
 
<EOS>
What
these
unhappy
men
confessed
,
or
what
was
ever
confessed
by
any
one
under
that
agony
,
must
always
be
received
with
great
doubt
,
as
it
is
certain
that
people
have
frequently
owned
to
the
most
absurd
and
impossible
crimes
to
escape
such
dreadful
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
can
not
doubt
it
to
have
been
proved
by
papers
,
that
there
were
many
plots
,
both
among
the
Jesuits
,
and
with
France
,
and
with
Scotland
,
and
with
Spain
,
for
the
destruction
of
Queen
Elizabeth
,
for
the
placing
of
Mary
on
the
throne
,
and
for
the
revival
of
the
old
religion
.
  
<EOS>
If
the
English
people
were
too
ready
to
believe
in
plots
,
there
were
,
as
I
have
said
,
good
reasons
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
massacre
of
Saint
Bartholomew
was
yet
fresh
in
their
recollection
,
a
great
Protestant
Dutch
hero
,
the
PRINCE
OF
ORANGE
,
was
shot
by
an
assassin
,
who
confessed
that
he
had
been
kept
and
trained
for
the
purpose
in
a
college
of
Jesuits
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dutch
,
in
this
surprise
and
distress
,
offered
to
make
Elizabeth
their
sovereign
,
but
she
declined
the
honour
,
and
sent
them
a
small
army
instead
,
under
the
command
of
the
Earl
of
Leicester
,
who
,
although
a
capital
Court
favourite
,
was
not
much
of
a
general
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
so
little
in
Holland
,
that
his
campaign
there
would
probably
have
been
forgotten
,
but
for
its
occasioning
the
death
of
one
of
the
best
writers
,
the
best
knights
,
and
the
best
gentlemen
,
of
that
or
any
age
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
SIR
PHILIP
SIDNEY
,
who
was
wounded
by
a
musket
ball
in
the
thigh
as
he
mounted
a
fresh
horse
,
after
having
had
his
own
killed
under
him
.
<EOS>
He
had
to
ride
back
wounded
,
a
long
distance
,
and
was
very
faint
with
fatigue
and
loss
of
blood
,
when
some
water
,
for
which
he
had
eagerly
asked
,
was
handed
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
so
good
and
gentle
even
then
,
that
seeing
a
poor
badly
wounded
common
soldier
lying
on
the
ground
,
looking
at
the
water
with
longing
eyes
,
he
said
,
"
Thy
necessity
is
greater
than
mine
,
"
and
gave
it
up
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
touching
action
of
a
noble
heart
is
perhaps
as
well
known
as
any
incident
in
history
---
is
as
famous
far
and
wide
as
the
blood
-
stained
Tower
of
London
,
with
its
axe
,
and
block
,
and
murders
out
of
number
.
 
<EOS>
So
delightful
is
an
act
of
true
humanity
,
and
so
glad
are
mankind
to
remember
it
.
  
<EOS>
At
home
,
intelligence
of
plots
began
to
thicken
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
I
suppose
the
people
never
did
live
under
such
continual
terrors
as
those
by
which
they
were
possessed
now
,
of
Catholic
risings
,
and
burnings
,
and
poisonings
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
we
must
always
remember
that
they
lived
near
and
close
to
awful
realities
of
that
kind
,
and
that
with
their
experience
it
was
not
difficult
to
believe
in
any
enormity
.
 
<EOS>
The
government
had
the
same
fear
,
and
did
not
take
the
best
means
of
discovering
the
truth
---
for
,
besides
torturing
the
suspected
,
it
employed
paid
spies
,
who
will
always
lie
for
their
own
profit
.
 
<EOS>
It
even
made
some
of
the
conspiracies
it
brought
to
light
,
by
sending
false
letters
to
disaffected
people
,
inviting
them
to
join
in
pretended
plots
,
which
they
too
readily
did
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
one
great
real
plot
was
at
length
discovered
,
and
it
ended
the
career
of
Mary
,
Queen
of
Scots
.
 
<EOS>
A
seminary
priest
named
BALLARD
,
and
a
Spanish
soldier
named
SAVAGE
,
set
on
and
encouraged
by
certain
French
priests
,
imparted
a
design
to
one
ANTONY
BABINGTON
---
a
gentleman
of
fortune
in
Derbyshire
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
a
secret
agent
of
Mary
's
---
for
murdering
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Babington
then
confided
the
scheme
to
some
other
Catholic
gentlemen
who
were
his
friends
,
and
they
joined
in
it
heartily
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
vain
,
weak
-
headed
young
men
,
ridiculously
confident
,
and
preposterously
proud
of
their
plan
;
for
they
got
a
gimcrack
painting
made
,
of
the
six
choice
spirits
who
were
to
murder
Elizabeth
,
with
Babington
in
an
attitude
for
the
centre
figure
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
their
number
,
however
,
one
of
whom
was
a
priest
,
kept
Elizabeth
's
wisest
minister
,
SIR
FRANCIS
WALSINGHAM
,
acquainted
with
the
whole
project
from
the
first
.
 
<EOS>
The
conspirators
were
completely
deceived
to
the
final
point
,
when
Babington
gave
Savage
,
because
he
was
shabby
,
a
ring
from
his
finger
,
and
some
money
from
his
purse
,
wherewith
to
buy
himself
new
clothes
in
which
to
kill
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
Walsingham
,
having
then
full
evidence
against
the
whole
band
,
and
two
letters
of
Mary
's
besides
,
resolved
to
seize
them
.
 
<EOS>
Suspecting
something
wrong
,
they
stole
out
of
the
city
,
one
by
one
,
and
hid
themselves
in
St
John
's
Wood
,
and
other
places
which
really
were
hiding
places
then
;
but
they
were
all
taken
,
and
all
executed
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
were
seized
,
a
gentleman
was
sent
from
Court
to
inform
Mary
of
the
fact
,
and
of
her
being
involved
in
the
discovery
.
 
<EOS>
Her
friends
have
complained
that
she
was
kept
in
very
hard
and
severe
custody
.
 
<EOS>
It
does
not
appear
very
likely
,
for
she
was
going
out
a
hunting
that
very
morning
.
  
<EOS>
Queen
Elizabeth
had
been
warned
long
ago
,
by
one
in
France
who
had
good
information
of
what
was
secretly
doing
,
that
in
holding
Mary
alive
,
she
held
"
the
wolf
who
would
devour
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Bishop
of
London
had
,
more
lately
,
given
the
Queen
's
favourite
minister
the
advice
in
writing
,
"
forthwith
to
cut
off
the
Scottish
Queen
's
head
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
question
now
was
,
what
to
do
with
her
?
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Leicester
wrote
a
little
note
home
from
Holland
,
recommending
that
she
should
be
quietly
poisoned
;
that
noble
favourite
having
accustomed
his
mind
,
it
is
possible
,
to
remedies
of
that
nature
.
<EOS>
His
black
advice
,
however
,
was
disregarded
,
and
she
was
brought
to
trial
at
Fotheringay
Castle
in
Northamptonshire
,
before
a
tribunal
of
forty
,
composed
of
both
religions
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
and
in
the
Star
Chamber
at
Westminster
,
the
trial
lasted
a
fortnight
.
 
<EOS>
She
defended
herself
with
great
ability
,
but
could
only
deny
the
confessions
that
had
been
made
by
Babington
and
others
;
could
only
call
her
own
letters
,
produced
against
her
by
her
own
secretaries
,
forgeries
;
and
,
in
short
,
could
only
deny
everything
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
found
guilty
,
and
declared
to
have
incurred
the
penalty
of
death
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
met
,
approved
the
sentence
,
and
prayed
the
Queen
to
have
it
executed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
replied
that
she
requested
them
to
consider
whether
no
means
could
be
found
of
saving
Mary
's
life
without
endangering
her
own
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
rejoined
,
No
;
and
the
citizens
illuminated
their
houses
and
lighted
bonfires
,
in
token
of
their
joy
that
all
these
plots
and
troubles
were
to
be
ended
by
the
death
of
the
Queen
of
Scots
.
  
<EOS>
She
,
feeling
sure
that
her
time
was
now
come
,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
Queen
of
England
,
making
three
entreaties
;
first
,
that
she
might
be
buried
in
France
;
secondly
,
that
she
might
not
be
executed
in
secret
,
but
before
her
servants
and
some
others
;
thirdly
,
that
after
her
death
,
her
servants
should
not
be
molested
,
but
should
be
suffered
to
go
home
with
the
legacies
she
left
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
an
affecting
letter
,
and
Elizabeth
shed
tears
over
it
,
but
sent
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
a
special
ambassador
from
France
,
and
another
from
Scotland
,
to
intercede
for
Mary
's
life
;
and
then
the
nation
began
to
clamour
,
more
and
more
,
for
her
death
.
  
<EOS>
What
the
real
feelings
or
intentions
of
Elizabeth
were
,
can
never
be
known
now
;
but
I
strongly
suspect
her
of
only
wishing
one
thing
more
than
Mary
's
death
,
and
that
was
to
keep
free
of
the
blame
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
first
of
February
,
one
thousand
five
hundred
and
eighty
-
seven
,
Lord
Burleigh
having
drawn
out
the
warrant
for
the
execution
,
the
Queen
sent
to
the
secretary
DAVISON
to
bring
it
to
her
,
that
she
might
sign
it
:
 
which
she
did
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
when
Davison
told
her
it
was
sealed
,
she
angrily
asked
him
why
such
haste
was
necessary
?
 
<EOS>
Next
day
but
one
,
she
joked
about
it
,
and
swore
a
little
.
 
<EOS>
Again
,
next
day
but
one
,
she
seemed
to
complain
that
it
was
not
yet
done
,
but
still
she
would
not
be
plain
with
those
about
her
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
on
the
seventh
,
the
Earls
of
Kent
and
Shrewsbury
,
with
the
Sheriff
of
Northamptonshire
,
came
with
the
warrant
to
Fotheringay
,
to
tell
the
Queen
of
Scots
to
prepare
for
death
.
  
<EOS>
When
those
messengers
of
ill
omen
were
gone
,
Mary
made
a
frugal
supper
,
drank
to
her
servants
,
read
over
her
will
,
went
to
bed
,
slept
for
some
hours
,
and
then
arose
and
passed
the
remainder
of
the
night
saying
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
morning
she
dressed
herself
in
her
best
clothes
;
and
,
at
eight
o'clock
when
the
sheriff
came
for
her
to
her
chapel
,
took
leave
of
her
servants
who
were
there
assembled
praying
with
her
,
and
went
down
-
stairs
,
carrying
a
Bible
in
one
hand
and
a
crucifix
in
the
other
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
her
women
and
four
of
her
men
were
allowed
to
be
present
in
the
hall
;
where
a
low
scaffold
,
only
two
feet
from
the
ground
,
was
erected
and
covered
with
black
;
and
where
the
executioner
from
the
Tower
,
and
his
assistant
,
stood
,
dressed
in
black
velvet
.
 
<EOS>
The
hall
was
full
of
people
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
sentence
was
being
read
she
sat
upon
a
stool
;
and
,
when
it
was
finished
,
she
again
denied
her
guilt
,
as
she
had
done
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Kent
and
the
Dean
of
Peterborough
,
in
their
Protestant
zeal
,
made
some
very
unnecessary
speeches
to
her
;
to
which
she
replied
that
she
died
in
the
Catholic
religion
,
and
they
need
not
trouble
themselves
about
that
matter
.
 
<EOS>
When
her
head
and
neck
were
uncovered
by
the
executioners
,
she
said
that
she
had
not
been
used
to
be
undressed
by
such
hands
,
or
before
so
much
company
.
 
<EOS>
Finally
,
one
of
her
women
fastened
a
cloth
over
her
face
,
and
she
laid
her
neck
upon
the
block
,
and
repeated
more
than
once
in
Latin
,
"
Into
thy
hands
,
<EOS>
O
Lord
,
I
commend
my
spirit
!
"
 
<EOS>
Some
say
her
head
was
struck
off
in
two
blows
,
some
say
in
three
.
 
<EOS>
However
that
be
,
when
it
was
held
up
,
streaming
with
blood
,
the
real
hair
beneath
the
false
hair
she
had
long
worn
was
seen
to
be
as
grey
as
that
of
a
woman
of
seventy
,
though
she
was
at
that
time
only
in
her
forty
-
sixth
year
.
 
<EOS>
All
her
beauty
was
gone
.
  
<EOS>
But
she
was
beautiful
enough
to
her
little
dog
,
who
cowered
under
her
dress
,
frightened
,
when
she
went
upon
the
scaffold
,
and
who
lay
down
beside
her
headless
body
when
all
her
earthly
sorrows
were
over
.
  
<EOS>
Third
Part
    
ON
its
being
formally
made
known
to
Elizabeth
that
the
sentence
had
been
executed
on
the
Queen
of
Scots
,
she
showed
the
utmost
grief
and
rage
,
drove
her
favourites
from
her
with
violent
indignation
,
and
sent
Davison
to
the
Tower
;
from
which
place
he
was
only
released
in
the
end
by
paying
an
immense
fine
which
completely
ruined
him
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
not
only
over
-
acted
her
part
in
making
these
pretences
,
but
most
basely
reduced
to
poverty
one
of
her
faithful
servants
for
no
other
fault
than
obeying
her
commands
.
  
<EOS>
James
,
King
of
Scotland
,
Mary
's
son
,
made
a
show
likewise
of
being
very
angry
on
the
occasion
;
but
he
was
a
pensioner
of
England
to
the
amount
of
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
he
had
known
very
little
of
his
mother
,
and
he
possibly
regarded
her
as
the
murderer
of
his
father
,
and
he
soon
took
it
quietly
.
  
<EOS>
Philip
,
King
of
Spain
,
however
,
threatened
to
do
greater
things
than
ever
had
been
done
yet
,
to
set
up
the
Catholic
religion
and
punish
Protestant
England
.
 
<EOS>
Elizabeth
,
hearing
that
he
and
the
Prince
of
Parma
were
making
great
preparations
for
this
purpose
,
in
order
to
be
beforehand
with
them
sent
out
ADMIRAL
DRAKE
(
a
famous
navigator
,
who
had
sailed
about
the
world
,
and
had
already
brought
great
plunder
from
Spain
)
to
the
port
of
Cadiz
,
where
he
burnt
a
hundred
vessels
full
of
stores
.
 
<EOS>
This
great
loss
obliged
the
Spaniards
to
put
off
the
invasion
for
a
year
;
but
it
was
none
the
less
formidable
for
that
,
amounting
to
one
hundred
and
thirty
ships
,
nineteen
thousand
soldiers
,
eight
thousand
sailors
,
two
thousand
slaves
,
and
between
two
and
three
thousand
great
guns
.
<EOS>
England
was
not
idle
in
making
ready
to
resist
this
great
force
.
<EOS>
All
the
men
between
sixteen
years
old
and
sixty
,
were
trained
and
drilled
;
the
national
fleet
of
ships
<EOS>
(
in
number
only
thirty
-
four
at
first
)
was
enlarged
by
public
contributions
and
by
private
ships
,
fitted
out
by
noblemen
;
the
city
of
London
,
of
its
own
accord
,
furnished
double
the
number
of
ships
and
men
that
it
was
required
to
provide
;
and
,
if
ever
the
national
spirit
was
up
in
England
,
it
was
up
all
through
the
country
to
resist
the
Spaniards
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
Queen
's
advisers
were
for
seizing
the
principal
English
Catholics
,
and
putting
them
to
death
;
but
the
Queen
---
who
,
to
her
honour
,
used
to
say
,
that
she
would
never
believe
any
ill
of
her
subjects
,
which
a
parent
would
not
believe
of
her
own
children
---
rejected
the
advice
,
and
only
confined
a
few
of
those
who
were
the
most
suspected
,
in
the
fens
in
Lincolnshire
.
 
<EOS>
The
great
body
of
Catholics
deserved
this
confidence
;
for
they
behaved
most
loyally
,
nobly
,
and
bravely
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
with
all
England
firing
up
like
one
strong
,
angry
man
,
and
with
both
sides
of
the
Thames
fortified
,
and
with
the
soldiers
under
arms
,
and
with
the
sailors
in
their
ships
,
the
country
waited
for
the
coming
of
the
proud
Spanish
fleet
,
which
was
called
THE
INVINCIBLE
ARMADA
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
herself
,
riding
in
armour
on
a
white
horse
,
and
the
Earl
of
Essex
and
the
Earl
of
Leicester
holding
her
bridal
rein
,
made
a
brave
speech
to
the
troops
at
Tilbury
Fort
opposite
Gravesend
,
which
was
received
with
such
enthusiasm
as
is
seldom
known
.
 
<EOS>
Then
came
the
Spanish
Armada
into
the
English
Channel
,
sailing
along
in
the
form
of
a
half
moon
,
of
such
great
size
that
it
was
seven
miles
broad
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
English
were
quickly
upon
it
,
and
woe
then
to
all
the
Spanish
ships
that
dropped
a
little
out
of
the
half
moon
,
for
the
English
took
them
instantly
!
<EOS>
And
it
soon
appeared
that
the
great
Armada
was
anything
but
invincible
,
for
on
a
summer
night
,
bold
Drake
sent
eight
blazing
fire
-
ships
right
into
the
midst
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
In
terrible
consternation
the
Spaniards
tried
to
get
out
to
sea
,
and
so
became
dispersed
;
the
English
pursued
them
at
a
great
advantage
;
a
storm
came
on
,
and
drove
the
Spaniards
among
rocks
and
shoals
;
and
the
swift
end
of
the
Invincible
fleet
was
,
that
it
lost
thirty
great
ships
and
ten
thousand
men
,
and
,
defeated
and
disgraced
,
sailed
home
again
.
<EOS>
Being
afraid
to
go
by
the
English
Channel
,
it
sailed
all
round
Scotland
and
Ireland
;
some
of
the
ships
getting
cast
away
on
the
latter
coast
in
bad
weather
,
the
Irish
,
who
were
a
kind
of
savages
,
plundered
those
vessels
and
killed
their
crews
.
 
<EOS>
So
ended
this
great
attempt
to
invade
and
conquer
England
.
 
<EOS>
And
I
think
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
any
other
invincible
fleet
coming
to
England
with
the
same
object
,
will
fare
much
better
than
the
Spanish
Armada
.
  
<EOS>
Though
the
Spanish
king
had
had
this
bitter
taste
of
English
bravery
,
he
was
so
little
the
wiser
for
it
,
as
still
to
entertain
his
old
designs
,
and
even
to
conceive
the
absurd
idea
of
placing
his
daughter
on
the
English
throne
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
SIR
WALTER
RALEIGH
,
SIR
THOMAS
HOWARD
,
and
some
other
distinguished
leaders
,
put
to
sea
from
Plymouth
,
entered
the
port
of
Cadiz
once
more
,
obtained
a
complete
victory
over
the
shipping
assembled
there
,
and
got
possession
of
the
town
.
 
<EOS>
In
obedience
to
the
Queen
's
express
instructions
,
they
behaved
with
great
humanity
;
and
the
principal
loss
of
the
Spaniards
was
a
vast
sum
of
money
which
they
had
to
pay
for
ransom
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
one
of
many
gallant
achievements
on
the
sea
,
effected
in
this
reign
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
himself
,
after
marrying
a
maid
of
honour
and
giving
offence
to
the
Maiden
Queen
thereby
,
had
already
sailed
to
South
America
in
search
of
gold
.
  
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Leicester
was
now
dead
,
and
so
was
Sir
Thomas
Walsingham
,
whom
Lord
Burleigh
was
soon
to
follow
.
 
<EOS>
The
principal
favourite
was
the
EARL
OF
ESSEX
,
a
spirited
and
handsome
man
,
a
favourite
with
the
people
too
as
well
as
with
the
Queen
,
and
possessed
of
many
admirable
qualities
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
much
debated
at
Court
whether
there
should
be
peace
with
Spain
or
no
,
and
he
was
very
urgent
for
war
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
tried
hard
to
have
his
own
way
in
the
appointment
of
a
deputy
to
govern
in
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
while
this
question
was
in
dispute
,
he
hastily
took
offence
,
and
turned
his
back
upon
the
Queen
;
as
a
gentle
reminder
of
which
impropriety
,
the
Queen
gave
him
a
tremendous
box
on
the
ear
,
and
told
him
to
go
to
the
devil
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
home
instead
,
and
did
not
reappear
at
Court
for
half
a
year
or
so
,
when
he
and
the
Queen
were
reconciled
,
though
never
(
as
some
suppose
)
thoroughly
.
  
<EOS>
From
this
time
the
fate
of
the
Earl
of
Essex
and
that
of
the
Queen
seemed
to
be
blended
together
.
 
<EOS>
The
Irish
were
still
perpetually
quarrelling
and
fighting
among
themselves
,
and
he
went
over
to
Ireland
as
Lord
Lieutenant
,
to
the
great
joy
of
his
enemies
<EOS>
(
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
among
the
rest
)
,
who
were
glad
to
have
so
dangerous
a
rival
far
off
.
 
<EOS>
Not
being
by
any
means
successful
there
,
and
knowing
that
his
enemies
would
take
advantage
of
that
circumstance
to
injure
him
with
the
Queen
,
he
came
home
again
,
though
against
her
orders
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
being
taken
by
surprise
when
he
appeared
before
her
,
gave
him
her
hand
to
kiss
,
and
he
was
overjoyed
---
though
it
was
not
a
very
lovely
hand
by
this
time
---
<EOS>
but
in
the
course
of
the
same
day
she
ordered
him
to
confine
himself
to
his
room
,
and
two
or
three
days
afterwards
had
him
taken
into
custody
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
sort
of
caprice
---
and
as
capricious
an
old
woman
she
now
was
,
as
ever
wore
a
crown
or
a
head
either
---
she
sent
him
broth
from
her
own
table
on
his
falling
ill
from
anxiety
,
and
cried
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
a
man
who
could
find
comfort
and
occupation
in
his
books
,
and
he
did
so
for
a
time
;
not
the
least
happy
time
<EOS>
,
I
dare
say
,
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
happened
unfortunately
for
him
,
that
he
held
a
monopoly
in
sweet
wines
:
 
which
means
that
nobody
could
sell
them
without
purchasing
his
permission
.
 
<EOS>
This
right
,
which
was
only
for
a
term
<EOS>
,
expiring
,
he
applied
to
have
it
renewed
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
refused
,
with
the
rather
strong
observation
---
but
she
DID
make
strong
observations
---
that
an
unruly
beast
must
be
stinted
in
his
food
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
angry
Earl
,
who
had
been
already
deprived
of
many
offices
,
thought
himself
in
danger
of
complete
ruin
,
and
turned
against
the
Queen
,
whom
he
called
a
vain
old
woman
who
had
grown
as
crooked
in
her
mind
as
she
had
in
her
figure
.
 
<EOS>
These
uncomplimentary
expressions
the
ladies
of
the
Court
immediately
snapped
up
and
carried
to
the
Queen
,
whom
they
did
not
put
in
a
better
tempter
,
you
may
believe
.
 
<EOS>
The
same
Court
ladies
,
when
they
had
beautiful
dark
hair
of
their
own
,
used
to
wear
false
red
hair
,
to
be
like
the
Queen
.
 
<EOS>
So
they
were
not
very
high
-
spirited
ladies
,
however
high
in
rank
.
  
<EOS>
The
worst
object
of
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
and
some
friends
of
his
who
used
to
meet
at
LORD
SOUTHAMPTON
'S
house
,
was
to
obtain
possession
of
the
Queen
,
and
oblige
her
by
force
to
dismiss
her
ministers
and
change
her
favourites
.
 
<EOS>
On
Saturday
the
seventh
of
February
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
one
,
the
council
suspecting
this
,
summoned
the
Earl
to
come
before
them
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
pretending
to
be
ill
,
declined
;
it
was
then
settled
among
his
friends
,
that
as
the
next
day
would
be
Sunday
,
when
many
of
the
citizens
usually
assembled
at
the
Cross
by
St
Paul
's
Cathedral
,
he
should
make
one
bold
effort
to
induce
them
to
rise
and
follow
him
to
the
Palace
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
on
the
Sunday
morning
,
he
and
a
small
body
of
adherents
started
out
of
his
house
---
<EOS>
Essex
House
by
the
Strand
,
with
steps
to
the
river
---
<EOS>
having
first
shut
up
in
it
,
as
prisoners
,
some
members
of
the
council
who
came
to
examine
him
---
and
hurried
into
the
City
with
the
Earl
at
their
head
crying
out
"
For
the
Queen
!
 
<EOS>
For
the
Queen
!
 
<EOS>
A
plot
is
laid
for
my
life
!
"
 
<EOS>
No
one
heeded
them
,
however
,
and
when
they
came
to
St
Paul
's
there
were
no
citizens
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
the
prisoners
at
Essex
House
had
been
released
by
one
of
the
Earl
's
own
friends
;
he
had
been
promptly
proclaimed
a
traitor
in
the
City
itself
;
and
the
streets
were
barricaded
with
carts
and
guarded
by
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
got
back
to
his
house
by
water
,
with
difficulty
,
and
after
an
attempt
to
defend
his
house
against
the
troops
and
cannon
by
which
it
was
soon
surrounded
,
gave
himself
up
that
night
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
brought
to
trial
on
the
nineteenth
,
and
found
guilty
;
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
,
he
was
executed
on
Tower
Hill
,
where
he
died
,
at
thirty
-
four
years
old
,
both
courageously
and
penitently
.
 
<EOS>
His
step
-
father
suffered
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
His
enemy
,
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,
stood
near
the
scaffold
all
the
time
---
but
not
so
near
it
as
we
shall
see
him
stand
,
before
we
finish
his
history
.
  
<EOS>
In
this
case
,
as
in
the
cases
of
the
Duke
of
Norfolk
and
Mary
Queen
of
Scots
,
the
Queen
had
commanded
,
and
countermanded
,
and
again
commanded
,
the
execution
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
probable
that
the
death
of
her
young
and
gallant
favourite
in
the
prime
of
his
good
qualities
,
was
never
off
her
mind
afterwards
,
but
she
held
out
,
the
same
vain
,
obstinate
and
capricious
woman
,
for
another
year
.
 
<EOS>
Then
she
danced
before
her
Court
on
a
state
occasion
---
and
cut
,
I
should
think
,
a
mighty
ridiculous
figure
,
doing
so
in
an
immense
ruff
,
stomacher
and
wig
,
at
seventy
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
For
another
year
still
,
she
held
out
,
but
,
without
any
more
dancing
,
and
as
a
moody
,
sorrowful
,
broken
creature
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
on
the
tenth
of
March
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
three
,
having
been
ill
of
a
very
bad
cold
,
and
made
worse
by
the
death
of
the
Countess
of
Nottingham
who
was
her
intimate
friend
,
she
fell
into
a
stupor
and
was
supposed
to
be
dead
.
 
<EOS>
She
recovered
her
consciousness
,
however
,
and
then
nothing
would
induce
her
to
go
to
bed
;
for
she
said
that
she
knew
that
if
she
did
,
she
should
never
get
up
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
she
lay
for
ten
days
,
on
cushions
on
the
floor
,
without
any
food
,
until
the
Lord
Admiral
got
her
into
bed
at
last
,
partly
by
persuasions
and
partly
by
main
force
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
asked
her
who
should
succeed
her
,
she
replied
that
her
seat
had
been
the
seat
of
Kings
,
and
that
she
would
have
for
her
successor
,
"
No
rascal
's
son
,
but
a
King
's
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
,
the
lords
present
stared
at
one
another
,
and
took
the
liberty
of
asking
whom
she
meant
;
to
which
she
replied
,
"
Whom
should
I
mean
,
but
our
cousin
of
Scotland
!
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
on
the
twenty
-
third
of
March
.
 
<EOS>
They
asked
her
once
again
that
day
,
after
she
was
speechless
,
whether
she
was
still
in
the
same
mind
?
 
<EOS>
She
struggled
up
in
bed
,
and
joined
her
hands
over
her
head
in
the
form
of
a
crown
,
as
the
only
reply
she
could
make
.
 
<EOS>
At
three
o'clock
next
morning
,
she
very
quietly
died
,
in
the
forty
-
fifth
year
of
her
reign
.
  
<EOS>
That
reign
had
been
a
glorious
one
,
and
is
made
for
ever
memorable
by
the
distinguished
men
who
flourished
in
it
.
 
<EOS>
Apart
from
the
great
voyagers
,
statesmen
,
and
scholars
,
whom
it
produced
,
the
names
of
BACON
,
SPENSER
,
and
SHAKESPEARE
,
will
always
be
remembered
with
pride
and
veneration
by
the
civilised
world
,
and
will
always
impart
(
though
with
no
great
reason
,
perhaps
)
some
portion
of
their
lustre
to
the
name
of
Elizabeth
herself
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
reign
for
discovery
,
for
commerce
,
and
for
English
enterprise
and
spirit
in
general
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
great
reign
for
the
Protestant
religion
and
for
the
Reformation
which
made

The
Queen
was
very
popular
,
and
in
her
progresses
,
or
journeys
about
her
dominions
,
was
everywhere
received
with
the
liveliest
joy
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
the
truth
is
,
that
she
was
not
half
so
good
as
she
has
been
made
out
,
and
not
half
so
bad
as
she
has
been
made
out
.
 
<EOS>
She
had
her
fine
qualities
,
but
she
was
coarse
,
capricious
,
and
treacherous
,
and
had
all
the
faults
of
an
excessively
vain
young
woman
long
after
she
was
an
old
one
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
she
had
a
great
deal
too
much
of
her
father
in
her
,
to
please
me
.
  
<EOS>
Many
improvements
and
luxuries
were
introduced
in
the
course
of
these
five
-
and
-
forty
years
in
the
general
manner
of
living
;
but
cock
-
fighting
,
bull
-
baiting
,
and
bear
-
baiting
,
were
still
the
national
amusements
;
and
a
coach
was
so
rarely
seen
,
and
was
such
an
ugly
and
cumbersome
affair
when
it
was
seen
,
that
even
the
Queen
herself
,
on
many
high
occasions
,
rode
on
horseback
on
a
pillion
behind
the
Lord
Chancellor
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
James
<EOS>
the
First
    
"
OUR
cousin
of
Scotland
"
was
ugly
,
awkward
,
and
shuffling
both
in
mind
and
person
.
 
<EOS>
His
tongue
was
much
too
large
for
his
mouth
,
his
legs
were
much
too
weak
for
his
body
,
and
his
dull
goggle
-
eyes
stared
and
rolled
like
an
idiot
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
cunning
,
covetous
,
wasteful
,
idle
,
drunken
,
greedy
,
dirty
,
cowardly
,
a
great
swearer
,
and
the
most
conceited
man
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
His
figure
---
<EOS>
what
is
commonly
called
rickety
from
his
birth
---
presented
a
most
ridiculous
appearance
,
dressed
in
thick
padded
clothes
,
as
a
safeguard
against
being
stabbed
(
of
which
he
lived
in
continual
fear
)
,
of
a
grass
-
green
colour
from
head
to
foot
,
with
a
hunting
-
horn
dangling
at
his
side
instead
of
a
sword
,
and
his
hat
and
feather
sticking
over
one
eye
,
or
hanging
on
the
back
of
his
head
,
as
he
happened
to
toss
it
on
.
 
<EOS>
He
used
to
loll
on
the
necks
of
his
favourite
courtiers
,
and
slobber
their
faces
,
and
kiss
and
pinch
their
cheeks
;
and
the
greatest
favourite
he
ever
had
,
used
to
sign
himself
in
his
letters
to
his
royal
master
,
His
Majesty
's
"
dog
and
slave
,
"
and
used
to
address
his
majesty
as
"
his
Sowship
.
"
 
<EOS>
His
majesty
was
the
worst
rider
ever
seen
,
and
thought
himself
the
best
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
most
impertinent
talkers
(
in
the
broadest
Scotch
)
ever
heard
,
and
boasted
of
being
unanswerable
in
all
manner
of
argument
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
some
of
the
most
wearisome
treatises
ever
read
---
among
others
,
a
book
upon
witchcraft
,
in
which
he
was
a
devout
believer
---
and
thought
himself
a
prodigy
of
authorship
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
,
and
wrote
,
and
said
,
that
a
king
had
a
right
to
make
and
unmake
what
laws
he
pleased
,
and
ought
to
be
accountable
to
nobody
on
earth
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
plain
,
true
character
of
the
personage
whom
the
greatest
men
about
the
court
praised
and
flattered
to
that
degree
,
that
I
doubt
if
there
be
anything
much
more
shameful
in
the
annals
of
human
nature
.
  
<EOS>
He
came
to
the
English
throne
with
great
ease
.
 
<EOS>
The
miseries
of
a
disputed
succession
had
been
felt
so
long
,
and
so
dreadfully
,
that
he
was
proclaimed
within
a
few
hours
of
Elizabeth
's
death
,
and
was
accepted
by
the
nation
,
even
without
being
asked
to
give
any
pledge
that
he
would
govern
well
,
or
that
he
would
redress
crying
grievances
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
a
month
to
come
from
Edinburgh
to
London
;
and
,
by
way
of
exercising
his
new
power
,
hanged
a
pickpocket
on
the
journey
without
any
trial
,
and
knighted
everybody
he
could
lay
hold
of
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
two
hundred
knights
before
he
got
to
his
palace
in
London
,
and
seven
hundred
before
he
had
been
in
it
three
months
.
<EOS>
He
also
shovelled
sixty
-
two
new
peers
into
the
House
of
Lords
---
and
there
was
a
pretty
large
sprinkling
of
Scotchmen
among
them
,
you
may
believe
.
  
<EOS>
His
Sowship
's
prime
Minister
,
CECIL
(
for
I
can
not
do
better
than
call
his
majesty
<EOS>
what
his
favourite
called
him
)
,
was
the
enemy
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,
and
also
of
Sir
Walter
's
political
friend
,
LORD
COBHAM
;
and
his
Sowship
's
first
trouble
was
a
plot
originated
by
these
two
,
and
entered
into
by
some
others
,
with
the
old
object
of
seizing
the
King
and
keeping
him
in
imprisonment
until
he
should
change
his
ministers
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
Catholic
priests
in
the
plot
,
and
there
were
Puritan
noblemen
too
;
for
,
although
the
Catholics
and
Puritans
were
strongly
opposed
to
each
other
,
they
united
at
this
time
against
his
Sowship
,
because
they
knew
that
he
had
a
design
against
both
,
after
pretending
to
be
friendly
to
each
;
this
design
being
to
have
only
one
high
and
convenient
form
of
the
Protestant
religion
,
which
everybody
should
be
bound
to
belong
to
,
whether
they
liked
it
or
not
.
 
<EOS>
This
plot
was
mixed
up
with
another
,
which
may
or
may
not
have
had
some
reference
to
placing
on
the
throne
,
at
some
time
,
the
LADY
ARABELLA
STUART
;
whose
misfortune
it
was
,
to
be
the
daughter
of
the
younger
brother
of
his
Sowship
's
father
,
but
who
was
quite
innocent
of
any
part
in
the
scheme
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
was
accused
on
the
confession
of
Lord
Cobham
---
a
miserable
creature
,
who
said
one
thing
at
one
time
,
and
another
thing
at
another
time
,
and
could
be
relied
upon
in
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
The
trial
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
lasted
from
eight
in
the
morning
until
nearly
midnight
;
he
defended
himself
with
such
eloquence
,
genius
,
and
spirit
against
all
accusations
,
and
against
the
insults
of
COKE
,
the
Attorney
-
General
---
who
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
time
,
foully
abused
him
---
that
those
who
went
there
detesting
the
prisoner
,
came
away
admiring
him
,
and
declaring
that
anything
so
wonderful
and
so
captivating
was
never
heard
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
found
guilty
,
nevertheless
,
and
sentenced
to
death
.
 
<EOS>
Execution
was
deferred
,
and
he
was
taken
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
The
two
Catholic
priests
,
less
fortunate
,
were
executed
with
the
usual
atrocity
;
and
Lord
Cobham
and
two
others
were
pardoned
on
the
scaffold
.
 
<EOS>
His
Sowship
thought
it
wonderfully
knowing
in
him
to
surprise
the
people
by
pardoning
these
three
at
the
very
block
;
but
,
blundering
,
and
bungling
,
as
usual
,
he
had
very
nearly
overreached
himself
.
 
<EOS>
For
,
the
messenger
on
horseback
who
brought
the
pardon
,
came
so
late
,
that
he
was
pushed
to
the
outside
of
the
crowd
,
and
was
obliged
to
shout
and
roar
out
what
he
came
for
.
 
<EOS>
The
miserable
Cobham
did
not
gain
much
by
being
spared
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
He
lived
,
both
as
a
prisoner
and
a
beggar
,
utterly
despised
,
and
miserably
poor
,
for
thirteen
years
,
and
then
died
in
an
old
outhouse
belonging
to
one
of
his
former
servants
.
  
<EOS>
This
plot
got
rid
of
,
and
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
safely
shut
up
in
the
Tower
,
his
Sowship
held
a
great
dispute
with
the
Puritans
on
their
presenting
a
petition
to
him
,
and
had
it
all
his
own
way
---
not
so
very
wonderful
,
as
he
would
talk
continually
,
and
would
not
hear
anybody
else
---
and
filled
the
Bishops
with
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
comfortably
settled
that
there
was
to
be
only
one
form
of
religion
,
and
that
all
men
were
to
think
exactly
alike
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
although
this
was
arranged
two
centuries
and
a
half
ago
,
and
although
the
arrangement
was
supported
by
much
fining
and
imprisonment
,
I
do
not
find
that
it
is
quite
successful
,
even
yet
.
  
<EOS>
His
Sowship
,
having
that
uncommonly
high
opinion
of
himself
as
a
king
,
had
a
very
low
opinion
of
Parliament
as
a
power
that
audaciously
wanted
to
control
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
called
his
first
Parliament
after
he
had
been
king
a
year
,
he
accordingly
thought
he
would
take
pretty
high
ground
with
them
,
and
told
them
that
he
commanded
them
"
as
an
absolute
king
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
thought
those
strong
words
,
and
saw
the
necessity
of
upholding
their
authority
.
<EOS>
His
Sowship
had
three
children
:
 
Prince
Henry
,
Prince
Charles
,
and
the
Princess
Elizabeth
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
well
for
one
of
these
,
and
we
shall
too
soon
see
which
,
if
he
had
learnt
a
little
wisdom
concerning
Parliaments
from
his
father
's
obstinacy
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
the
people
still
labouring
under
their
old
dread
of
the
Catholic
religion
,
this
Parliament
revived
and
strengthened
the
severe
laws
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
this
so
angered
ROBERT
CATESBY
,
a
restless
Catholic
gentleman
of
an
old
family
,
that
he
formed
one
of
the
most
desperate
and
terrible
designs
ever
conceived
in
the
mind
of
man
;
no
less
a
scheme
than
the
Gunpowder
Plot
.
  
<EOS>
His
object
was
,
when
the
King
,
lords
,
and
commons
,
should
be
assembled
at
the
next
opening
of
Parliament
,
to
blow
them
up
,
one
and
all
,
with
a
great
mine
of
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
person
to
whom
he
confided
this
horrible
idea
was
THOMAS
WINTER
,
a
Worcestershire
gentleman
who
had
served
in
the
army
abroad
,
and
had
been
secretly
employed
in
Catholic
projects
.
 
<EOS>
While
Winter
was
yet
undecided
,
and
when
he
had
gone
over
to
the
Netherlands
,
to
learn
from
the
Spanish
Ambassador
there
whether
there
was
any
hope
of
Catholics
being
relieved
through
the
intercession
of
the
King
of
Spain
with
his
Sowship
,
he
found
at
Ostend
a
tall
,
dark
,
daring
man
,
whom
he
had
known
when
they
were
both
soldiers
abroad
,
and
whose
name
was
GUIDO
---
or
GUY
---
FAWKES
.
 
<EOS>
Resolved
to
join
the
plot
,
he
proposed
it
to
this
man
,
knowing
him
to
be
the
man
for
any
desperate
deed
,
and
they
two
came
back
to
England
together
.
 
<EOS>
Here
,
they
admitted
two
other
conspirators
;
THOMAS
PERCY
,
related
to
the
Earl
of
Northumberland
,
and
JOHN
WRIGHT
,
his
brother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
All
these
met
together
in
a
solitary
house
in
the
open
fields
which
were
then
near
Clement
's
Inn
,
now
a
closely
blocked
-
up
part
of
London
;
and
when
they
had
all
taken
a
great
oath
of
secrecy
,
Catesby
told
the
rest
what
his
plan
was
.
 
<EOS>
They
then
went
up
-
stairs
into
a
garret
,
and
received
the
Sacrament
from
FATHER
GERARD
,
a
Jesuit
,
who
is
said
not
to
have
known
actually
of
the
Gunpowder
Plot
,
but
who
,
I
think
,
must
have
had
his
suspicions
that
there
was
something
desperate
afoot
.
  
<EOS>
Percy
was
a
Gentleman
Pensioner
,
and
as
he
had
occasional
duties
to
perform
about
the
Court
,
then
kept
at
Whitehall
,
there
would
be
nothing
suspicious
in
his
living
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
having
looked
well
about
him
,
and
having
found
a
house
to
let
,
the
back
of
which
joined
the
Parliament
House
,
he
hired
it
of
a
person
named
FERRIS
,
for
the
purpose
of
undermining
the
wall
.
 
<EOS>
Having
got
possession
of
this
house
,
the
conspirators
hired
another
on
the
Lambeth
side
of
the
Thames
,
which
they
used
as
a
storehouse
for
wood
,
gunpowder
,
and
other
combustible
matters
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
to
be
removed
at
night
(
and
afterwards
were
removed
)
,
bit
by
bit
,
to
the
house
at
Westminster
;
and
,
that
there
might
be
some
trusty
person
to
keep
watch
over
the
Lambeth
stores
,
they
admitted
another
conspirator
,
by
name
ROBERT
KAY
,
a
very
poor
Catholic
gentleman
.
  
<EOS>
All
these
arrangements
had
been
made
some
months
,
and
it
was
a
dark
,
wintry
,
December
night
,
when
the
conspirators
,
who
had
been
in
the
meantime
dispersed
to
avoid
observation
,
met
in
the
house
at
Westminster
,
and
began
to
dig
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
laid
in
a
good
stock
of
eatables
,
to
avoid
going
in
and
out
,
and
they
dug
and
dug
with
great
ardour
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
wall
being
tremendously
thick
,
and
the
work
very
severe
,
they
took
into
their
plot
CHRISTOPHER
WRIGHT
,
a
younger
brother
of
John
Wright
,
that
they
might
have
a
new
pair
of
hands
to
help
.
 
<EOS>
And
Christopher
Wright
fell
to
like
a
fresh
man
,
and
they
dug
and
dug
by
night
and
by
day
,
and
Fawkes
stood
sentinel
all
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
if
any
man
's
heart
seemed
to
fail
him
at
all
,
Fawkes
said
,
"
Gentlemen
,
we
have
abundance
of
powder
and
shot
here
,
and
there
is
no
fear
of
our
being
taken
alive
,
even
if
discovered
.
"
<EOS>
The
same
Fawkes
,
who
,
in
the
capacity
of
sentinel
,
was
always
prowling
about
,
soon
picked
up
the
intelligence
that
the
King
had
prorogued
the
Parliament
again
,
from
the
seventh
of
February
,
the
day
first
fixed
upon
,
until
the
third
of
October
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
conspirators
knew
this
,
they
agreed
to
separate
until
after
the
Christmas
holidays
,
and
to
take
no
notice
of
each
other
in
the
meanwhile
,
and
never
to
write
letters
to
one
another
on
any
account
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
house
in
Westminster
was
shut
up
again
,
and
I
suppose
the
neighbours
thought
that
those
strange
-
looking
men
who
lived
there
so
gloomily
,
and
went
out
so
seldom
,
were
gone
away
to
have
a
merry
Christmas
somewhere
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
beginning
of
February
,
sixteen
hundred
and
five
,
when
Catesby
met
his
fellow
-
conspirators
again
at
this
Westminster
house
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
now
admitted
three
more
;
JOHN
GRANT
,
a
Warwickshire
gentleman
of
a
melancholy
temper
,
who
lived
in
a
doleful
house
near
Stratford
-
upon
-
Avon
,
with
a
frowning
wall
all
round
it
,
and
a
deep
moat
;
ROBERT
WINTER
,
eldest
brother
of
Thomas
;
and
Catesby
's
own
servant
,
THOMAS
BATES
,
who
,
Catesby
thought
,
had
had
some
suspicion
of
what
his
master
was
about
.
 
<EOS>
These
three
had
all
suffered
more
or
less
for
their
religion
in
Elizabeth
's
time
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
,
they
all
began
to
dig
again
,
and
they
dug
and
dug
by
night
and
by
day
.
  
<EOS>
They
found
it
dismal
work
alone
there
,
underground
,
with
such
a
fearful
secret
on
their
minds
,
and
so
many
murders
before
them
.
<EOS>
They
were
filled
with
wild
fancies
.
 
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
they
thought
they
heard
a
great
bell
tolling
,
deep
down
in
the
earth
under
the
Parliament
House
;
sometimes
,
they
thought
they
heard
low
voices
muttering
about
the
Gunpowder
Plot
;
once
in
the
morning
,
they
really
did
hear
a
great
rumbling
noise
over
their
heads
,
as
they
dug
and
sweated
in
their
mine
.
 
<EOS>
Every
man
stopped
and
looked
aghast
at
his
neighbour
,
wondering
what
had
happened
,
when
that
bold
prowler
,
Fawkes
,
who
had
been
out
to
look
,
came
in
and
told
them
that
it
was
only
a
dealer
in
coals
who
had
occupied
a
cellar
under
the
Parliament
House
,
removing
his
stock
in
trade
to
some
other
place
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
conspirators
,
who
with
all
their
digging
and
digging
had
not
yet
dug
through
the
tremendously
thick
wall
,
changed
their
plan
;
hired
that
cellar
,
which
was
directly
under
the
House
of
Lords
;
put
six
-
and
-
thirty
barrels
of
gunpowder
in
it
,
and
covered
them
over
with
fagots
and
coals
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
all
dispersed
again
till
September
,
when
the
following
new
conspirators
were
admitted
;
SIR
EDWARD
BAYNHAM
,
of
Gloucestershire
;
SIR
EVERARD
DIGBY
,
of
Rutlandshire
;
AMBROSE
ROOKWOOD
,
of
Suffolk
;
FRANCIS
TRESHAM
,
of
Northamptonshire
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
these
were
rich
,
and
were
to
assist
the
plot
,
some
with
money
and
some
with
horses
on
which
the
conspirators
were
to
ride
through
the
country
and
rouse
the
Catholics
after
the
Parliament
should
be
blown
into
air
.
  
<EOS>
Parliament
being
again
prorogued
from
the
third
of
October
to
the
fifth
of
November
,
and
the
conspirators
being
uneasy
lest
their
design
should
have
been
found
out
<EOS>
,
Thomas
Winter
said
he
would
go
up
into
the
House
of
Lords
on
the
day
of
the
prorogation
,
and
see
how
matters
looked
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
better
.
 
<EOS>
The
unconscious
Commissioners
were
walking
about
and
talking
to
one
another
,
just
over
the
six
-
and
-
thirty
barrels
of
gunpowder
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
back
and
told
the
rest
so
,
and
they
went
on
with
their
preparations
.
 
<EOS>
They
hired
a
ship
,
and
kept
it
ready
in
the
Thames
,
in
which
Fawkes
was
to
sail
for
Flanders
after
firing
with
a
slow
match
the
train
that
was
to
explode
the
powder
.
 
<EOS>
A
number
of
Catholic
gentlemen
not
in
the
secret
,
were
invited
,
on
pretence
of
a
hunting
party
,
to
meet
Sir
Everard
Digby
at
Dunchurch
on
the
fatal
day
,
that
they
might
be
ready
to
act
together
.
 
<EOS>
And
now
all
was
ready
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
now
,
the
great
wickedness
and
danger
which
had
been
all
along
at
the
bottom
of
this
wicked
plot
,
began
to
show
itself
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
fifth
of
November
drew
near
,
most
of
the
conspirators
,
remembering
that
they
had
friends
and
relations
who
would
be
in
the
House
of
Lords
that
day
,
felt
some
natural
relenting
,
and
a
wish
to
warn
them
to
keep
away
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
not
much
comforted
by
Catesby
's
declaring
that
in
such
a
cause
he
would
blow
up
his
own
son
.
 
<EOS>
LORD
MOUNTEAGLE
,
Tresham
's
brother
-
in
-
law
,
was
certain
to
be
in
the
house
;
and
when
Tresham
found
that
he
could
not
prevail
upon
the
rest
to
devise
any
means
of
sparing
their
friends
,
he
wrote
a
mysterious
letter
to
this
lord
and
left
it
at
his
lodging
in
the
dusk
,
urging
him
to
keep
away
from
the
opening
of
Parliament
,
"
since
God
and
man
had
concurred
to
punish
the
wickedness
of
the
times
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
It
contained
the
words
"
that
the
Parliament
should
receive
a
terrible
blow
,
and
yet
should
not
see
who
hurt
them
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
it
added
,
"
the
danger
is
past
,
as
soon
as
you
have
burnt
the
letter
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
ministers
and
courtiers
made
out
that
his
Sowship
,
by
a
direct
miracle
from
Heaven
,
found
out
what
this
letter
meant
.
 
<EOS>
The
truth
is
,
that
they
were
not
long
(
as
few
men
would
be
)
in
finding
out
for
themselves
;
and
it
was
decided
to
let
the
conspirators
alone
,
until
the
very
day
before
the
opening
of
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
conspirators
had
their
fears
,
is
certain
;
for
,
Tresham
himself
said
before
them
all
,
that
they
were
every
one
dead
men
;
and
,
although
even
he
did
not
take
flight
,
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
he
had
warned
other
persons
besides
Lord
Mounteagle
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
they
were
all
firm
;
and
Fawkes
,
who
was
a
man
of
iron
,
went
down
every
day
and
night
to
keep
watch
in
the
cellar
as
usual
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
there
about
two
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
,
when
the
Lord
Chamberlain
and
Lord
Mounteagle
threw
open
the
door
and
looked
in
.
 
<EOS>
"
Who
are
you
,
friend
?
"
said
they
.
 
<EOS>
"
Why
,
"
said
Fawkes
,
"
I
am
Mr
Percy
's
servant
,
and
am
looking
after
his
store
of
fuel
here
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
Your
master
has
laid
in
a
pretty
good
store
,
"
they
returned
,
and
shut
the
door
,
and
went
away
.
 
<EOS>
Fawkes
,
upon
this
,
posted
off
to
the
other
conspirators
to
tell
them
all
was
quiet
,
and
went
back
and
shut
himself
up
in
the
dark
,
black
cellar
again
,
where
he
heard
the
bell
go
twelve
o'clock
and
usher
in
the
fifth
of
November
.
 
<EOS>
About
two
hours
afterwards
,
he
slowly
opened
the
door
,
and
came
out
to
look
about
him
,
in
his
old
prowling
way
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
instantly
seized
and
bound
,
by
a
party
of
soldiers
under
SIR
THOMAS
KNEVETT
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
watch
upon
him
,
some
touchwood
,
some
tinder
,
some
slow
matches
;
and
there
was
a
dark
lantern
with
a
candle
in
it
,
lighted
,
behind
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
had
his
boots
and
spurs
on
---
to
ride
to
the
ship
,
I
suppose
---
and
it
was
well
for
the
soldiers
that
they
took
him
so
suddenly
.
<EOS>
If
they
had
left
him
but
a
moment
's
time
to
light
a
match
,
he
certainly
would
have
tossed
it
in
among
the
powder
,
and
blown
up
himself
and
them
.
  
<EOS>
They
took
him
to
the
King
's
bed
-
chamber
first
of
all
,
and
there
the
King
(
causing
him
to
be
held
very
tight
,
and
keeping
a
good
way
off
)
,
asked
him
how
he
could
have
the
heart
to
intend
to
destroy
so
many
innocent
people
?
 
<EOS>
"
Because
,
"
said
Guy
Fawkes
,
"
desperate
diseases
need
desperate
remedies
.
"
 
<EOS>
To
a
little
Scotch
favourite
,
with
a
face
like
a
terrier
,
who
asked
him
(
with
no
particular
wisdom
)
why
he
had
collected
so
much
gunpowder
,
he
replied
,
because
he
had
meant
to
blow
Scotchmen
back
to
Scotland
,
and
it
would
take
a
deal
of
powder
to
do
that
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
he
was
carried
to
the
Tower
,
but
would
make
no
confession
.
 
<EOS>
Even
after
being
horribly
tortured
,
he
confessed
nothing
that
the
Government
did
not
already
know
;
though
he
must
have
been
in
a
fearful
state
---
as
his
signature
,
still
preserved
,
in
contrast
with
his
natural
hand
-
writing
before
he
was
put
upon
the
dreadful
rack
,
most
frightfully
shows
.
 
<EOS>
Bates
,
a
very
different
man
,
soon
said
the
Jesuits
had
had
to
do
with
the
plot
,
and
probably
,
under
the
torture
,
would
as
readily
have
said
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Tresham
,
taken
and
put
in
the
Tower
too
,
made
confessions
and
unmade
them
,
and
died
of
an
illness
that
was
heavy
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Rookwood
,
who
had
stationed
relays
of
his
own
horses
all
the
way
to
Dunchurch
,
did
not
mount
to
escape
until
the
middle
of
the
day
,
when
the
news
of
the
plot
was
all
over
London
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
road
,
he
came
up
with
the
two
Wrights
,
Catesby
,
and
Percy
;
and
they
all
galloped
together
into
Northamptonshire
.
 
<EOS>
Thence
to
Dunchurch
,
where
they
found
the
proposed
party
assembled
.
 
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
that
there
had
been
a
plot
,
and
that
it
had
been
discovered
,
the
party
disappeared
in
the
course
of
the
night
,
and
left
them
alone
with
Sir
Everard
Digby
.
 
<EOS>
Away
they
all
rode
again
,
through
Warwickshire
and
Worcestershire
,
to
a
house
called
Holbeach
,
on
the
borders
of
Staffordshire
.
 
<EOS>
They
tried
to
raise
the
Catholics
on
their
way
,
but
were
indignantly
driven
off
by
them
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
they
were
hotly
pursued
by
the
sheriff
of
Worcester
,
and
a
fast
increasing
concourse
of
riders
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
resolving
to
defend
themselves
at
Holbeach
,
they
shut
themselves
up
in
the
house
,
and
put
some
wet
powder
before
the
fire
to
dry
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
blew
up
,
and
Catesby
was
singed
and
blackened
,
and
almost
killed
,
and
some
of
the
others
were
sadly
hurt
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
knowing
that
they
must
die
,
they
resolved
to
die
there
,
and
with
only
their
swords
in
their
hands
appeared
at
the
windows
to
be
shot
at
by
the
sheriff
and
his
assistants
.
 
<EOS>
Catesby
said
to
Thomas
Winter
,
after
Thomas
had
been
hit
in
the
right
arm
which
dropped
powerless
by
his
side
,
"
Stand
by
me
,
Tom
,
and
we
will
die
together
!
"
<EOS>
---
which
they
did
,
being
shot
through
the
body
by
two
bullets
from
one
gun
.
 
<EOS>
John
Wright
,
and
Christopher
Wright
,
and
Percy
,
were
also
shot
.
 
<EOS>
Rookwood
and
Digby
were
taken
:
 
the
former
with
a
broken
arm
and
a
wound
in
his
body
too
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
fifteenth
of
January
,
before
the
trial
of
Guy
Fawkes
,
and
such
of
the
other
conspirators
as
were
left
alive
,
came
on
.
<EOS>
They
were
all
found
guilty
,
all
hanged
,
drawn
,
and
quartered
:
<EOS>
some
,
in
St
Paul
's
Churchyard
,
on
the
top
of
Ludgate
-
hill
;
some
,
before
the
Parliament
House
.
 
<EOS>
A
Jesuit
priest
,
named
HENRY
GARNET
,
to
whom
the
dreadful
design
was
said
to
have
been
communicated
,
was
taken
and
tried
;
and
two
of
his
servants
,
as
well
as
a
poor
priest
who
was
taken
with
him
,
were
tortured
without
mercy
.
 
<EOS>
He
himself
was
not
tortured
,
but
was
surrounded
in
the
Tower
by
tamperers
and
traitors
,
and
so
was
made
unfairly
to
convict
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
upon
his
trial
,
that
he
had
done
all
he
could
to
prevent
the
deed
,
and
that
he
could
not
make
public
what
had
been
told
him
in
confession
---
though
I
am
afraid
he
knew
of
the
plot
in
other
ways
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
found
guilty
and
executed
,
after
a
manful
defence
,
and
the
Catholic
Church
made
a
saint
of
him
;
some
rich
and
powerful
persons
,
who
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
project
,
were
fined
and
imprisoned
for
it
by
the
Star
Chamber
;
the
Catholics
,
in
general
,
who
had
recoiled
with
horror
from
the
idea
of
the
infernal
contrivance
,
were
unjustly
put
under
more
severe
laws
than
before
;
and
this
was
the
end
of
the
Gunpowder
Plot
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
<EOS>
His
Sowship
would
pretty
willingly
,
I
think
,
have
blown
the
House
of
Commons
into
the
air
himself
;
for
,
his
dread
and
jealousy
of
it
knew
no
bounds
all
through
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
hard
pressed
for
money
he
was
obliged
to
order
it
to
meet
,
as
he
could
get
no
money
without
it
;
and
when
it
asked
him
first
to
abolish
some
of
the
monopolies
in
necessaries
of
life
which
were
a
great
grievance
to
the
people
,
and
to
redress
other
public
wrongs
,
he
flew
into
a
rage
and
got
rid
of
it
again
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
he
wanted
it
to
consent
to
the
Union
of
England
with
Scotland
,
and
quarrelled
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
At
another
time
it
wanted
him
to
put
down
a
most
infamous
Church
abuse
,
called
the
High
Commission
Court
,
and
he
quarrelled
with
it
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
At
another
time
it
entreated
him
not
to
be
quite
so
fond
of
his
archbishops
and
bishops
who
made
speeches
in
his
praise
too
awful
to
be
related
,
but
to
have
some
little
consideration
for
the
poor
Puritan
clergy
who
were
persecuted
for
preaching
in
their
own
way
,
and
not
according
to
the
archbishops
and
bishops
;
and
they
quarrelled
about
that
.
 
<EOS>
In
short
,
what
with
hating
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
pretending
not
to
hate
it
;
and
what
with
now
sending
some
of
its
members
who
opposed
him
,
to
Newgate
or
to
the
Tower
,
and
now
telling
the
rest
that
they
must
not
presume
to
make
speeches
about
the
public
affairs
which
could
not
possibly
concern
them
;
and
what
with
cajoling
,
and
bullying
,
and
fighting
,
and
being
frightened
;
the
House
of
Commons
was
the
plague
of
his
Sowship
's
existence
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
pretty
firm
,
however
,
in
maintaining
its
rights
,
and
insisting
that
the
Parliament
should
make
the
laws
,
and
not
the
King
by
his
own
single
proclamations
(
which
he
tried
hard
to
do
)
;
and
his
Sowship
was
so
often
distressed
for
money
,
in
consequence
,
that
he
sold
every
sort
of
title
and
public
office
as
if
they
were
merchandise
,
and
even
invented
a
new
dignity
called
a
Baronetcy
,
which
anybody
could
buy
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
  
<EOS>
These
disputes
with
his
Parliaments
,
and
his
hunting
,
and
his
drinking
,
and
his
lying
in
bed
---
for
he
was
a
great
sluggard
---
occupied
his
Sowship
pretty
well
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
his
time
he
chiefly
passed
in
hugging
and
slobbering
his
favourites
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
was
SIR
PHILIP
HERBERT
,
who
had
no
knowledge
<EOS>
whatever
,
except
of
dogs
,
and
horses
,
and
hunting
,
but
whom
he
soon
made
EARL
OF
MONTGOMERY
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
,
and
a
much
more
famous
one
,
was
ROBERT
CARR
,
or
KER
<EOS>
(
for
it
is
not
certain
which
was
his
right
name
)
,
who
came
from
the
Border
country
,
and
whom
he
soon
made
VISCOUNT
ROCHESTER
,
and
afterwards
,
EARL
OF
SOMERSET
.
 
<EOS>
The
way
in
which
his
Sowship
doted
on
this
handsome
young
man
,
is
even
more
odious
to
think
of
,
than
the
way
in
which
the
really
great
men
of
England
condescended
to
bow
down
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
favourite
's
great
friend
was
a
certain
SIR
THOMAS
OVERBURY
,
who
wrote
his
love
-
letters
for
him
,
and
assisted
him
in
the
duties
of
his
many
high
places
,
which
his
own
ignorance
prevented
him
from
discharging
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
same
Sir
Thomas
having
just
manhood
enough
to
dissuade
the
favourite
from
a
wicked
marriage
with
the
beautiful
Countess
of
Essex
,
who
was
to
get
a
divorce
from
her
husband
for
the
purpose
,
<EOS>
the
said
Countess
,
in
her
rage
,
got
Sir
Thomas
put
into
the
Tower
,
and
there
poisoned
him
.
<EOS>
Then
the
favourite
and
this
bad
woman
were
publicly
married
by
the
King
's
pet
bishop
,
with
as
much
to
-
do
and
rejoicing
,
as
if
he
had
been
the
best
man
,
and
she
the
best
woman
,
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
after
a
longer
sunshine
than
might
have
been
expected
---
of
seven
years
or
so
,
that
is
to
say
---
another
handsome
young
man
started
up
and
eclipsed
the
EARL
OF
SOMERSET
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
GEORGE
VILLIERS
,
the
youngest
son
of
a
Leicestershire
gentleman
:
 
who
came
to
Court
with
all
the
Paris
fashions
on
him
,
and
could
dance
as
well
as
the
best
mountebank
that
ever
was
seen
.
 
<EOS>
He
soon
danced
himself
into
the
good
graces
of
his
Sowship
,
and
danced
the
other
favourite
out
of
favour
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
it
was
all
at
once
discovered
that
the
Earl
and
Countess
of
Somerset
had
not
deserved
all
those
great
promotions
and
mighty
rejoicings
,
and
they
were
separately
tried
for
the
murder
of
Sir
Thomas
Overbury
,
and
for
other
crimes
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
King
was
so
afraid
of
his
late
favourite
's
publicly
telling
some
disgraceful
things
he
knew
of
him
---
which
he
darkly
threatened
to
do
---
that
he
was
even
examined
with
two
men
standing
,
one
on
either
side
of
him
,
each
with
a
cloak
in
his
hand
,
ready
to
throw
it
over
his
head
and
stop
his
mouth
if
he
should
break
out
with
what
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
tell
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
a
very
lame
affair
was
purposely
made
of
the
trial
,
and
his
punishment
was
an
allowance
of
four
thousand
pounds
a
year
in
retirement
,
while
the
Countess
was
pardoned
,
and
allowed
to
pass
into
retirement
too
.
 
<EOS>
They
hated
one
another
by
this
time
,
and
lived
to
revile
and
torment
each
other
some
years
.
  
<EOS>
While
these
events
were
in
progress
,
and
while
his
Sowship
was
making
such
an
exhibition
of
himself
,
from
day
to
day
and
from
year
to
year
,
as
is
not
often
seen
in
any
sty
,
three
remarkable
deaths
took
place
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
was
that
of
the
Minister
,
Robert
Cecil
,
Earl
of
Salisbury
,
who
was
past
sixty
,
and
had
never
been
strong
,
being
deformed
from
his
birth
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
at
last
that
he
had
no
wish
to
live
;
and
no
Minister
need
have
had
,
with
his
experience
of
the
meanness
and
wickedness
of
those
disgraceful
times
.
 
<EOS>
The
second
was
that
of
the
Lady
Arabella
Stuart
,
who
alarmed
his
Sowship
mightily
,
by
privately
marrying
WILLIAM
SEYMOUR
,
son
of
LORD
BEAUCHAMP
,
who
was
a
descendant
of
King
Henry
the
Seventh
,
and
who
,
his
Sowship
thought
,
might
consequently
increase
and
strengthen
any
claim
she
might
one
day
set
up
to
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
separated
from
her
husband
(
who
was
put
in
the
Tower
)
and
thrust
into
a
boat
to
be
confined
at
Durham
.
 
<EOS>
She
escaped
in
a
man
's
dress
to
get
away
in
a
French
ship
from
Gravesend
to
France
,
but
unhappily
missed
her
husband
,
who
had
escaped
too
,
and
was
soon
taken
.
 
<EOS>
She
went
raving
mad
in
the
miserable
Tower
,
and
died
there
after
four
years
.
 
<EOS>
The
last
,
and
the
most
important
of
these
three
deaths
,
was
that
of
Prince
Henry
,
the
heir
to
the
throne
,
in
the
nineteenth
year
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
promising
young
prince
,
and
greatly
liked
;
a
quiet
,
well
-
conducted
youth
,
of
whom
two
very
good
things
are
known
:
 
first
,
that
his
father
was
jealous
of
him
;
secondly
,
that
he
was
the
friend
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,
languishing
through
all
those
years
in
the
Tower
,
and
often
said
that
no
man
but
his
father
would
keep
such
a
bird
in
such
a
cage
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
occasion
of
the
preparations
for
the
marriage
of
his
sister
the
Princess
Elizabeth
with
a
foreign
prince
(
and
an
unhappy
marriage
it
turned
out
)
,
he
came
from
Richmond
,
where
he
had
been
very
ill
,
to
greet
his
new
brother
-
in
-
law
,
at
the
palace
at
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
played
a
great
game
at
tennis
,
in
his
shirt
,
though
it
was
very
cold
weather
,
and
was
seized
with
an
alarming
illness
,
and
died
within
a
fortnight
of
a
putrid
fever
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
young
prince
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
wrote
,
in
his
prison
in
the
Tower
,
the
beginning
of
a
History
of
the
World
:
 
<EOS>
a
wonderful
instance
how
little
his
Sowship
could
do
to
confine
a
great
man
's
mind
<EOS>
,
however
long
he
might
imprison
his
body
.
  
<EOS>
And
this
mention
of
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
,
who
had
many
faults
,
but
who
never
showed
so
many
merits
as
in
trouble
and
adversity
,
may
bring
me
at
once
to
the
end
of
his
sad
story
.
 
<EOS>
After
an
imprisonment
in
the
Tower
of
twelve
long
years
,
he
proposed
to
resume
those
old
sea
voyages
of
his
,
and
to
go
to
South
America
in
search
of
gold
.
 
<EOS>
His
Sowship
,
divided
between
his
wish
to
be
on
good
terms
with
the
Spaniards
through
whose
territory
Sir
Walter
must
pass
(
he
had
long
had
an
idea
of
marrying
Prince
Henry
to
a
Spanish
Princess
)
,
and
his
avaricious
eagerness
to
get
hold
of
the
gold
,
did
not
know
what
to
do
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
end
,
he
set
Sir
Walter
free
,
taking
securities
for
his
return
;
and
Sir
Walter
fitted
out
an
expedition
at
his
own
coast
and
,
on
the
twenty
-
eighth
of
March
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
seventeen
,
sailed
away
in
command
of
one
of
its
ships
,
which
he
ominously
called
the
Destiny
.
 
<EOS>
The
expedition
failed
;
the
common
men
,
not
finding
the
gold
they
had
expected
,
mutinied
;
a
quarrel
broke
out
between
Sir
Walter
and
the
Spaniards
,
who
hated
him
for
old
successes
of
his
against
them
;
and
he
took
and
burnt
a
little
town
called
SAINT
THOMAS
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
he
was
denounced
to
his
Sowship
by
the
Spanish
Ambassador
as
a
pirate
;
and
returning
almost
broken
-
hearted
,
with
his
hopes
and
fortunes
shattered
,
his
company
of
friends
dispersed
,
and
his
brave
son
(
who
had
been
one
of
them
)
killed
,
he
was
taken
---
through
the
treachery
of
SIR
LEWIS
STUKELY
,
his
near
relation
,
a
scoundrel
and
a
Vice
-
Admiral
 
---
and
was
once
again
immured
in
his
prison
-
home
of
so
many
years
.
  
<EOS>
His
Sowship
being
mightily
disappointed
in
not
getting
any
gold
,
Sir
Walter
Raleigh
was
tried
as
unfairly
,
and
with
as
many
lies
and
evasions
as
the
judges
and
law
officers
and
every
other
authority
in
Church
and
State
habitually
practised
under
such
a
King
.
 
<EOS>
After
a
great
deal
of
prevarication
on
all
parts
but
his
own
,
it
was
declared
that
he
must
die
under
his
former
sentence
,
now
fifteen
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
on
the
twenty
-
eighth
of
October
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighteen
,
he
was
shut
up
in
the
Gate
House
at
Westminster
to
pass
his
late
night
on
earth
,
and
there
he
took
leave
of
his
good
and
faithful
lady
who
was
worthy
to
have
lived
in
better
days
.
 
<EOS>
At
eight
o'clock
next
morning
,
after
a
cheerful
breakfast
,
and
a
pipe
,
and
a
cup
of
good
wine
,
he
was
taken
to
Old
Palace
Yard
in
Westminster
,
where
the
scaffold
was
set
up
,
and
where
so
many
people
of
high
degree
were
assembled
to
see
him
die
,
that
it
was
a
matter
of
some
difficulty
to
get
him
through
the
crowd
.
 
<EOS>
He
behaved
most
nobly
,
but
if
anything
lay
heavy
on
his
mind
,
it
was
that
Earl
of
Essex
,
whose
head
he
had
seen
roll
off
;
and
he
solemnly
said
that
he
had
had
no
hand
in
bringing
him
to
the
block
,
and
that
he
had
shed
tears
for
him
when
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
morning
was
very
cold
,
the
Sheriff
said
,
would
he
come
down
to
a
fire
for
a
little
space
,
and
warm
himself
?
 
<EOS>
But
Sir
Walter
thanked
him
,
and
said
no
,
he
would
rather
it
were
done
at
once
,
for
he
was
ill
of
fever
and
ague
,
and
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
his
shaking
fit
would
come
upon
him
if
he
were
still
alive
,
and
his
enemies
might
then
suppose
that
he
trembled
for
fear
.
 
<EOS>
With
that
,
he
kneeled
and
made
a
very
beautiful
and
Christian
prayer
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
laid
his
head
upon
the
block
he
felt
the
edge
of
the
axe
,
and
said
,
with
a
smile
upon
his
face
,
that
it
was
a
sharp
medicine
,
but
would
cure
the
worst
disease
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
bent
down
ready
for
death
,
he
said
to
the
executioner
,
finding
that
he
hesitated
,
"
What
dost
thou
fear
?
 
<EOS>
Strike
,
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
axe
came
down
and
struck
his
head
off
,
in
the
sixty
-
sixth
year
of
his
age
.
  
<EOS>
The
new
favourite
got
on
fast
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
made
a
viscount
,
he
was
made
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
he
was
made
a
marquis
,
he
was
made
Master
of
the
Horse
,
he
was
made
Lord
High
Admiral
---
and
the
Chief
Commander
of
the
gallant
English
forces
that
had
dispersed
the
Spanish
Armada
,
was
displaced
to
make
room
for
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
whole
kingdom
at
his
disposal
,
and
his
mother
sold
all
the
profits
and
honours
of
the
State
,
as
if
she
had
kept
a
shop
.
 
<EOS>
He
blazed
all
over
with
diamonds
and
other
precious
stones
,
from
his
hatband
and
his
earrings
to
his
shoes
.
 
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
an
ignorant
presumptuous
,
swaggering
compound
of
knave
and
fool
,
with
nothing
but
his
beauty
and
his
dancing
to
recommend
him
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
the
gentleman
who
called
himself
his
Majesty
's
dog
and
slave
,
and
called
his
Majesty
Your
Sowship
.
 
<EOS>
His
Sowship
called
him
STEENIE
;
it
is
supposed
,
because
that
was
a
nickname
for
Stephen
,
and
because
St
Stephen
was
generally
represented
in
pictures
as
a
handsome
saint
.
  
<EOS>
His
Sowship
was
driven
sometimes
to
his
wits'-end
by
his
trimming
between
the
general
dislike
of
the
Catholic
religion
at
home
,
and
his
desire
to
wheedle
and
flatter
it
abroad
,
as
his
only
means
of
getting
a
rich
princess
for
his
son
's
wife
:
 
a
part
of
whose
fortune
he
might
cram
into
his
greasy
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
Prince
Charles
---
<EOS>
or
as
his
Sowship
called
him
,
Baby
Charles
---
<EOS>
being
now
PRINCE
OF
WALES
,
the
old
project
of
a
marriage
with
the
Spanish
King
's
daughter
had
been
revived
for
him
;
and
as
she
could
not
marry
a
Protestant
without
leave
from
the
Pope
,
his
Sowship
himself
secretly
and
meanly
wrote
to
his
Infallibility
,
asking
for
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
negotiation
for
this
Spanish
marriage
takes
up
a
larger
space
in
great
books
,
than
you
can
imagine
,
but
the
upshot
of
it
all
is
,
that
when
it
had
been
held
off
by
the
Spanish
Court
for
a
long
time
,
Baby
Charles
and
Steenie
set
off
in
disguise
as
Mr
Thomas
Smith
and
Mr
John
Smith
,
to
see
the
Spanish
Princess
;
that
Baby
Charles
pretended
to
be
desperately
in
love
with
her
,
and
jumped
off
walls
to
look
at
her
,
and
made
a
considerable
fool
of
himself
in
a
good
many
ways
;
that
she
was
called
Princess
of
Wales
and
that
the
whole
Spanish
Court
believed
Baby
Charles
to
be
all
but
dying
for
her
sake
,
as
he
expressly
told
them
he
was
;
that
Baby
Charles
and
Steenie
came
back
to
England
,
and
were
received
with
as
much
rapture
as
if
they
had
been
a
blessing
to
it
;
that
Baby
Charles
had
actually
fallen
in
love
with
HENRIETTA
MARIA
,
the
French
King
's
sister
,
whom
he
had
seen
in
Paris
;
that
he
thought
it
a
wonderfully
fine
and
princely
thing
to
have
deceived
the
Spaniards
,
all
through
;
and
that
he
openly
said
,
with
a
chuckle
,
as
soon
as
he
was
safe
and
sound
at
home
again
,
that
the
Spaniards
were
great
fools
to
have
believed
him
.
  
<EOS>
Like
most
dishonest
men
,
the
Prince
and
the
favourite
complained
that
the
people
whom
they
had
deluded
were
dishonest
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
such
misrepresentations
of
the
treachery
of
the
Spaniards
in
this
business
of
the
Spanish
match
,
that
the
English
nation
became
eager
for
a
war
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Although
the
gravest
Spaniards
laughed
at
the
idea
of
his
Sowship
in
a
warlike
attitude
,
the
Parliament
granted
money
for
the
beginning
of
hostilities
,
and
the
treaties
with
Spain
were
publicly
declared
to
be
at
an
end
.
 
<EOS>
The
Spanish
ambassador
in
London
---
probably
with
the
help
of
the
fallen
favourite
,
the
Earl
of
Somerset
---
being
unable
to
obtain
speech
with
his
Sowship
,
slipped
a
paper
into
his
hand
,
declaring
that
he
was
a
prisoner
in
his
own
house
,
and
was
entirely
governed
by
Buckingham
and
his
creatures
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
effect
of
this
letter
was
that
his
Sowship
began
to
cry
and
whine
,
and
took
Baby
Charles
away
from
Steenie
,
and
went
down
to
Windsor
,
gabbling
all
sorts
of
nonsense
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
it
was
that
his
Sowship
hugged
his
dog
and
slave
,
and
said
he
was
quite
satisfied
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
given
the
Prince
and
the
favourite
almost
unlimited
power
to
settle
anything
with
the
Pope
as
to
the
Spanish
marriage
;
and
he
now
,
with
a
view
to
the
French
one
,
signed
a
treaty
that
all
Roman
Catholics
in
England
should
exercise
their
religion
freely
,
and
should
never
be
required
to
take
any
oath
contrary
thereto
.
 
<EOS>
In
return
for
this
,
and
for
other
concessions
much
less
to
be
defended
,
Henrietta
Maria
was
to
become
the
Prince
's
wife
,
and
was
to
bring
him
a
fortune
of
eight
hundred
thousand
crowns
.
  
<EOS>
His
Sowship
's
eyes
were
getting
red
with
eagerly
looking
for
the
money
,
when
the
end
of
a
gluttonous
life
came
upon
him
;
and
,
after
a
fortnight
's
illness
,
on
Sunday
the
twenty
-
seventh
of
March
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
twenty
-
five
,
he
died
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
reigned
twenty
-
two
years
,
and
was
fifty
-
nine
years
old
.
 
<EOS>
I
know
of
nothing
more
abominable
in
history
than
the
adulation
that
was
lavished
on
this
King
,
and
the
vice
and
corruption
that
such
a
barefaced
habit
of
lying
produced
in
his
court
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
much
to
be
doubted
whether
one
man
of
honour
,
and
not
utterly
self
-
disgraced
,
kept
his
place
near
James
the
First
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Bacon
,
that
able
and
wise
philosopher
,
as
the
First
Judge
in
the
Kingdom
in
this
reign
,
became
a
public
spectacle
of
dishonesty
and
corruption
;
and
in
his
base
flattery
of
his
Sowship
,
and
in
his
crawling
servility
to
his
dog
and
slave
,
disgraced
himself
even
more
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
a
creature
like
his
Sowship
set
upon
a
throne
is
like
the
Plague
,
and
everybody
receives
infection
from
him
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Charles
<EOS>
the
First
    
BABY
CHARLES
became
KING
CHARLES
THE
FIRST
,
in
the
twenty
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
Unlike
his
father
,
he
was
usually
amiable
in
his
private
character
,
and
grave
and
dignified
in
his
bearing
;
but
,
like
his
father
,
he
had
monstrously
exaggerated
notions
of
the
rights
of
a
king
,
and
was
evasive
,
and
not
to
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
If
his
word
could
have
been
relied
upon
,
his
history
might
have
had
a
different
end
.
  
<EOS>
His
first
care
was
to
send
over
that
insolent
upstart
,
Buckingham
,
to
bring
Henrietta
Maria
from
Paris
to
be
his
Queen
;
<EOS>
upon
which
occasion
Buckingham
---
with
his
usual
audacity
---
made
love
to
the
young
Queen
of
Austria
,
and
was
very
indignant
indeed
with
CARDINAL
RICHELIEU
,
the
French
Minister
,
for
thwarting
his
intentions
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
people
were
very
well
disposed
to
like
their
new
Queen
,
and
to
receive
her
with
great
favour
when
she
came
among
them
as
a
stranger
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
she
held
the
Protestant
religion
in
great
dislike
,
and
brought
over
a
crowd
of
unpleasant
priests
,
who
made
her
do
some
very
ridiculous
things
,
and
forced
themselves
upon
the
public
notice
in
many
disagreeable
ways
.
 
<EOS>
Hence
,
the
people
soon
came
to
dislike
her
,
and
she
soon
came
to
dislike
them
;
and
she
did
so
much
all
through
this
reign
in
setting
the
King
(
who
was
dotingly
fond
of
her
)
against
his
subjects
,
that
it
would
have
been
better
for
him
if
she
had
never
been
born
.
  
<EOS>
Now
,
you
are
to
understand
that
King
Charles
the
First
---
of
his
own
determination
to
be
a
high
and
mighty
King
not
to
be
called
to
account
by
anybody
,
and
urged
on
by
his
Queen
besides
---
deliberately
set
himself
to
put
his
Parliament
down
and
to
put
himself
up
.
<EOS>
You
are
also
to
understand
,
that
even
in
pursuit
of
this
wrong
idea
(
enough
in
itself
to
have
ruined
any
king
)
<EOS>
he
never
took
a
straight
course
,
but
always
took
a
crooked
one
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
bent
upon
war
with
Spain
,
though
neither
the
House
of
Commons
nor
the
people
were
quite
clear
as
to
the
justice
of
that
war
,
now
that
they
began
to
think
a
little
more
about
the
story
of
the
Spanish
match
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
rushed
into
it
hotly
,
raised
money
by
illegal
means
to
meet
its
expenses
,
and
encountered
a
miserable
failure
at
Cadiz
,
in
the
very
first
year
of
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
An
expedition
to
Cadiz
had
been
made
in
the
hope
of
plunder
,
but
as
it
was
not
successful
,
it
was
necessary
to
get
a
grant
of
money
from
the
Parliament
;
and
when
they
met
,
in
no
very
complying
humour
,
the
,
King
told
them
,
"
to
make
haste
to
let
him
have
it
,
or
it
would
be
the
worse
for
themselves
.
"
 
<EOS>
Not
put
in
a
more
complying
humour
by
this
,
they
impeached
the
King
's
favourite
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
as
the
cause
(
which
he
undoubtedly
was
)
of
many
great
public
grievances
and
wrongs
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
to
save
him
,
dissolved
the
Parliament
without
getting
the
money
he
wanted
;
and
when
the
Lords
implored
him
to
consider
and
grant
a
little
delay
,
he
replied
,
"
No
,
not
one
minute
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
began
to
raise
money
for
himself
by
the
following
means
among
others
.
  
<EOS>
He
levied
certain
duties
called
tonnage
and
poundage
which
had
not
been
granted
by
the
Parliament
,
and
could
lawfully
be
levied
by
no
other
power
;
he
called
upon
the
seaport
towns
to
furnish
,
and
to
pay
all
the
cost
for
three
months
of
,
a
fleet
of
armed
ships
;
and
he
required
the
people
to
unite
in
lending
him
large
sums
of
money
,
the
repayment
of
which
was
very
doubtful
.
 
<EOS>
If
the
poor
people
refused
,
they
were
pressed
as
soldiers
or
sailors
;
if
the
gentry
refused
,
they
were
sent
to
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Five
gentlemen
,
named
SIR
THOMAS
DARNEL
,
JOHN
CORBET
,
WALTER
EARL
,
JOHN
HEVENINGHAM
,
and
EVERARD
HAMPDEN
,
for
refusing
were
taken
up
by
a
warrant
of
the
King
's
privy
council
,
and
were
sent
to
prison
without
any
cause
but
the
King
's
pleasure
being
stated
for
their
imprisonment
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
question
came
to
be
solemnly
tried
,
whether
this
was
not
a
violation
of
Magna
Charta
,
and
an
encroachment
by
the
King
on
the
highest
rights
of
the
English
people
.
 
<EOS>
His
lawyers
contended
<EOS>
No
,
because
to
encroach
upon
the
rights
of
the
English
people
would
be
to
do
wrong
,
and
the
King
could
do
no
wrong
.
 
<EOS>
The
accommodating
judges
decided
in
favour
of
this
wicked
nonsense
;
and
here
was
a
fatal
division
between
the
King
and
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
For
all
this
,
it
became
necessary
to
call
another
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
,
sensible
of
the
danger
in
which
their
liberties
were
,
chose
for
it
those
who
were
best
known
for
their
determined
opposition
to
the
King
;
but
still
the
King
,
quite
blinded
by
his
determination
to
carry
everything
before
him
,
addressed
them
when
they
met
,
in
a
contemptuous
manner
,
and
just
told
them
in
so
many
words
that
he
had
only
called
them
together
because
he
wanted
money
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
,
strong
enough
and
resolute
enough
to
know
that
they
would
lower
his
tone
,
cared
little
for
what
he
said
,
and
laid
before
him
one
of
the
great
documents
of
history
,
which
is
called
the
PETITION
OF
RIGHT
,
requiring
that
the
free
men
of
England
should
no
longer
be
called
upon
to
lend
the
King
money
,
and
should
no
longer
be
pressed
or
imprisoned
for
refusing
to
do
so
;
further
,
that
the
free
men
of
England
should
no
longer
be
seized
by
the
King
's
special
mandate
or
warrant
,
it
being
contrary
to
their
rights
and
liberties
and
the
laws
of
their
country
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
King
returned
an
answer
to
this
petition
,
in
which
he
tried
to
shirk
it
altogether
;
but
,
the
House
of
Commons
then
showing
their
determination
to
go
on
with
the
impeachment
of
Buckingham
,
the
King
in
alarm
returned
an
answer
,
giving
his
consent
to
all
that
was
required
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
not
only
afterwards
departed
from
his
word
and
honour
on
these
points
,
over
and
over
again
,
but
,
at
this
very
time
,
he
did
the
mean
and
dissembling
act
of
publishing
his
first
answer
and
not
his
second
---
merely
that
the
people
might
suppose
that
the
Parliament
had
not
got
the
better
of
him
.
  
<EOS>
That
pestilent
Buckingham
,
to
gratify
his
own
wounded
vanity
,
had
by
this
time
involved
the
country
in
war
with
France
,
as
well
as
with
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
For
such
miserable
causes
and
such
miserable
creatures
are
wars
sometimes
made
!
 
<EOS>
But
he
was
destined
to
do
little
more
mischief
in
this
world
.
 
<EOS>
One
morning
,
as
he
was
going
out
of
his
house
to
his
carriage
,
he
turned
to
speak
to
a
certain
Colonel
FRYER
who
was
with
him
;
and
he
was
violently
stabbed
with
a
knife
,
which
the
murderer
left
sticking
in
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
This
happened
in
his
hall
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
had
angry
words
up
-
stairs
,
just
before
,
with
some
French
gentlemen
,
who
were
immediately
suspected
by
his
servants
,
and
had
a
close
escape
from
being
set
upon
and
killed
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
the
noise
,
the
real
murderer
,
who
had
gone
to
the
kitchen
and
might
easily
have
got
away
,
drew
his
sword
and
cried
out
,
"
I
am
the
man
!
"
 
<EOS>
His
name
was
JOHN
FELTON
,
a
Protestant
and
a
retired
officer
in
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
had
no
personal
ill
-
will
to
the
Duke
,
but
had
killed
him
as
a
curse
to
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
aimed
his
blow
well
,
for
Buckingham
had
only
had
time
to
cry
out
,
"
Villain
!
"
<EOS>
and
then
he
drew
out
the
knife
,
fell
against
a
table
,
and
died
.
  
<EOS>
The
council
made
a
mighty
business
of
examining
John
Felton
about
this
murder
,
though
it
was
a
plain
case
enough
,
one
would
think
.
<EOS>
He
had
come
seventy
miles
to
do
it
,
he
told
them
,
and
he
did
it
for
the
reason
he
had
declared
;
if
they
put
him
upon
the
rack
,
as
that
noble
MARQUIS
OF
DORSET
whom
he
saw
before
him
,
had
the
goodness
to
threaten
,
he
gave
that
marquis
warning
,
that
he
would
accuse
HIM
as
his
accomplice
!
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
unpleasantly
anxious
to
have
him
racked
,
nevertheless
;
but
as
the
judges
now
found
out
that
torture
was
contrary
to
the
law
of
England
---
it
is
a
pity
they
did
not
make
the
discovery
a
little
sooner
---
John
Felton
was
simply
executed
for
the
murder
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
A
murder
it
undoubtedly
was
,
and
not
in
the
least
to
be
defended
:
 
though
he
had
freed
England
from
one
of
the
most
profligate
,
contemptible
,
and
base
court
<EOS>
favourites
to
whom
it
has
ever
yielded
.
  
<EOS>
A
very
different
man
now
arose
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
SIR
THOMAS
WENTWORTH
,
a
Yorkshire
gentleman
,
who
had
sat
in
Parliament
for
a
long
time
,
and
who
had
favoured
arbitrary
and
haughty
principles
,
but
who
had
gone
over
to
the
people
's
side
on
receiving
offence
from
Buckingham
.
<EOS>
The
King
,
much
wanting
such
a
man
---
for
,
besides
being
naturally
favourable
to
the
King
's
cause
,
he
had
great
abilities
---
made
him
first
a
Baron
,
and
then
a
Viscount
,
and
gave
him
high
employment
,
and
won
him
most
completely
.
  
<EOS>
A
Parliament
,
however
,
was
still
in
existence
,
and
was
NOT
to
be
won
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
twentieth
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
twenty
-
nine
,
SIR
JOHN
ELIOT
,
a
great
man
who
had
been
active
in
the
Petition
of
Right
,
brought
forward
other
strong
resolutions
against
the
King
's
chief
instruments
,
and
called
upon
the
Speaker
to
put
them
to
the
vote
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
the
Speaker
answered
,
"
he
was
commanded
otherwise
by
the
King
,
"
and
got
up
to
leave
the
chair
---
which
,
according
to
the
rules
of
the
House
of
Commons
would
have
obliged
it
to
adjourn
without
doing
anything
more
---
when
two
members
,
named
Mr
HOLLIS
and
Mr
VALENTINE
,
held
him
down
.
 
<EOS>
A
scene
of
great
confusion
arose
among
the
members
;
and
while
many
swords
were
drawn
and
flashing
about
,
the
King
,
who
was
kept
informed
of
all
that
was
going
on
,
told
the
captain
of
his
guard
to
go
down
to
the
House
and
force
the
doors
.
 
<EOS>
The
resolutions
were
by
that
time
,
however
,
voted
,
and
the
House
adjourned
.
 
<EOS>
Sir
John
Eliot
and
those
two
members
who
had
held
the
Speaker
down
,
were
quickly
summoned
before
the
council
.
 
<EOS>
As
they
claimed
it
to
be
their
privilege
not
to
answer
out
of
Parliament
for
anything
they
had
said
in
it
,
they
were
committed
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
then
went
down
and
dissolved
the
Parliament
,
in
a
speech
wherein
he
made
mention
of
these
gentlemen
as
"
Vipers
"
---
which
did
not
do
him
much
good
that
ever
I
have
heard
of
.
  
<EOS>
As
they
refused
to
gain
their
liberty
by
saying
they
were
sorry
for
what
they
had
done
,
the
King
,
always
remarkably
unforgiving
,
never
overlooked
their
offence
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
demanded
to
be
brought
up
before
the
court
of
King
's
Bench
,
he
even
resorted
to
the
meanness
of
having
them
moved
about
from
prison
to
prison
,
so
that
the
writs
issued
for
that
purpose
should
not
legally
find
them
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
they
came
before
the
court
and
were
sentenced
to
heavy
fines
,
and
to
be
imprisoned
during
the
King
's
pleasure
.
 
<EOS>
When
Sir
John
Eliot
's
health
had
quite
given
way
,
and
he
so
longed
for
change
of
air
and
scene
as
to
petition
for
his
release
,
the
King
sent
back
the
answer
(
worthy
of
his
Sowship
himself
)
that
the
petition
was
not
humble
enough
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
sent
another
petition
by
his
young
son
,
in
which
he
pathetically
offered
to
go
back
to
prison
when
his
health
was
restored
,
if
he
might
be
released
for
its
recovery
,
the
King
still
disregarded
it
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
died
in
the
Tower
,
and
his
children
petitioned
to
be
allowed
to
take
his
body
down
to
Cornwall
,
there
to
lay
it
among
the
ashes
of
his
forefathers
,
the
King
returned
for
answer
,
"
Let
Sir
John
Eliot
's
body
be
buried
in
the
church
of
that
parish
where
he
died
.
"
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
like
a
very
little
King
indeed
,
I
think
.
  
<EOS>
And
now
,
for
twelve
long
years
,
steadily
pursuing
his
design
of
setting
himself
up
and
putting
the
people
down
,
the
King
called
no
Parliament
;
but
ruled
without
one
.
 
<EOS>
If
twelve
thousand
volumes
were
written
in
his
praise
(
as
a
good
many
have
been
)
<EOS>
it
would
still
remain
a
fact
,
impossible
to
be
denied
,
that
for
twelve
years
King
Charles
the
First
reigned
in
England
unlawfully
and
despotically
,
seized
upon
his
subjects
"
goods
and
money
at
his
pleasure
,
and
punished
according
to
his
unbridled
will
all
who
ventured
to
oppose
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
a
fashion
with
some
people
to
think
that
this
King
's
career
was
cut
short
;
but
I
must
say
myself
that
I
think
he
ran
a
pretty
long
one
.
  
<EOS>
WILLIAM
LAUD
,
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
was
the
King
's
right
-
hand
man
in
the
religious
part
of
the
putting
down
of
the
people
's
liberties
.
 
<EOS>
Laud
,
who
was
a
sincere
man
,
of
large
learning
but
small
sense
---
for
the
two
things
sometimes
go
together
in
very
different
quantities
---
though
a
Protestant
,
held
opinions
so
near
those
of
the
Catholics
,
that
the
Pope
wanted
to
make
a
Cardinal
of
him
,
if
he
would
have
accepted
that
favour
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
vows
,
robes
,
lighted
candles
,
images
,
and
so
forth
,
as
amazingly
important
in
religious
ceremonies
;
and
he
brought
in
an
immensity
of
bowing
and
candle
-
snuffing
.
 
<EOS>
He
also
regarded
archbishops
and
bishops
as
a
sort
of
miraculous
persons
,
and
was
inveterate
in
the
last
degree
against
any
who
thought
otherwise
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
offered
up
thanks
to
Heaven
,
and
was
in
a
state
of
much
pious
pleasure
,
when
a
Scotch
clergyman
,
named
LEIGHTON
,
was
pilloried
,
whipped
,
branded
in
the
cheek
,
and
had
one
of
his
ears
cut
off
and
one
of
his
nostrils
slit
,
for
calling
bishops
trumpery
and
the
inventions
of
men
.
 
<EOS>
He
originated
on
a
Sunday
morning
the
prosecution
of
WILLIAM
PRYNNE
,
a
barrister
who
was
of
similar
opinions
,
and
who
was
fined
a
thousand
pounds
;
who
was
pilloried
;
who
had
his
ears
cut
off
on
two
occasions
---
<EOS>
one
ear
at
a
time
---
<EOS>
and
who
was
imprisoned
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
highly
approved
of
the
punishment
of
DOCTOR
BASTWICK
,
a
physician
;
who
was
also
fined
a
thousand
pounds
;
and
who
afterwards
had
HIS
ears
cut
off
,
and
was
imprisoned
for
life
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
gentle
methods
of
persuasion
,
some
will
tell
you
:
 
I
think
,
they
were
rather
calculated
to
be
alarming
to
the
people
.
  
<EOS>
In
the
money
part
of
the
putting
down
of
the
people
's
liberties
,
the
King
was
equally
gentle
,
as
some
will
tell
you
:
 
as
I
think
,
equally
alarming
.
 
<EOS>
He
levied
those
duties
of
tonnage
and
poundage
,
and
increased
them
as
he
thought
fit
.
 
<EOS>
He
granted
monopolies
to
companies
of
merchants
on
their
paying
him
for
them
,
notwithstanding
the
great
complaints
that
had
,
for
years
and
years
,
been
made
on
the
subject
of
monopolies
.
 
<EOS>
He
fined
the
people
for
disobeying
proclamations
issued
by
his
Sowship
in
direct
violation
of
law
.
 
<EOS>
He
revived
the
detested
Forest
laws
,
and
took
private
property
to
himself
as
his
forest
right
.
 
<EOS>
Above
all
,
he
determined
to
have
what
was
called
Ship
Money
;
that
is
to
say
,
money
for
the
support
of
the
fleet
---
not
only
from
the
seaports
,
but
from
all
the
counties
of
England
:
 
<EOS>
having
found
out
that
,
in
some
ancient
time
or
other
,
all
the
counties
paid
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
grievance
of
this
ship
money
being
somewhat
too
strong
,
JOHN
CHAMBERS
,
a
citizen
of
London
,
refused
to
pay
his
part
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
the
Lord
Mayor
ordered
John
Chambers
to
prison
,
and
for
that
John
Chambers
brought
a
suit
against
the
Lord
Mayor
.
 
<EOS>
LORD
SAY
,
also
,
behaved
like
a
real
nobleman
,
and
declared
he
would
not
pay
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
sturdiest
and
best
opponent
of
the
ship
money
was
JOHN
HAMPDEN
,
a
gentleman
of
Buckinghamshire
,
who
had
sat
among
the
"
vipers
"
in
the
House
of
Commons
when
there
was
such
a
thing
,
and
who
had
been
the
bosom
friend
of
Sir
John
Eliot
.
 
<EOS>
This
case
was
tried
before
the
twelve
judges
in
the
Court
of
Exchequer
,
and
again
the
King
's
lawyers
said
it
was
impossible
that
ship
money
could
be
wrong
,
because
the
King
could
do
no
wrong
,
however
hard
he
tried
---
and
he
really
did
try
very
hard
during
these
twelve
years
.
 
<EOS>
Seven
of
the
judges
said
that
was
quite
true
,
and
Mr
Hampden
was
bound
to
pay
:
 
<EOS>
five
of
the
judges
said
that
was
quite
false
,
and
Mr
Hampden
was
not
bound
to
pay
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
King
triumphed
(
as
he
thought
)
,
by
making
Hampden
the
most
popular
man
in
England
;
where
matters
were
getting
to
that
height
now
,
that
many
honest
Englishmen
could
not
endure
their
country
,
and
sailed
away
across
the
seas
to
found
a
colony
in
Massachusetts
Bay
in
America
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
said
that
Hampden
himself
and
his
relation
OLIVER
CROMWELL
were
going
with
a
company
of
such
voyagers
,
and
were
actually
on
board
ship
,
when
they
were
stopped
by
a
proclamation
,
prohibiting
sea
captains
to
carry
out
such
passengers
without
the
royal
license
.
 
<EOS>
But
O
!
<EOS>
it
would
have
been
well
for
the
King
if
he
had
let
them
go
!
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
state
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
If
Laud
had
been
a
madman
just
broke
loose
,
he
could
not
have
done
more
mischief
than
he
did
in
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
In
his
endeavours
(
in
which
he
was
seconded
by
the
King
,
then
in
person
in
that
part
of
his
dominions
)
to
force
his
own
ideas
of
bishops
,
and
his
own
religious
forms
and
ceremonies
upon
the
Scotch
,
he
roused
that
nation
to
a
perfect
frenzy
.
 
<EOS>
They
formed
a
solemn
league
,
which
they
called
The
Covenant
,
for
the
preservation
of
their
own
religious
forms
;
they
rose
in
arms
throughout
the
whole
country
;
they
summoned
all
their
men
to
prayers
and
sermons
twice
a
day
by
beat
of
drum
;
they
sang
psalms
,
in
which
they
compared
their
enemies
to
all
the
evil
spirits
that
ever
were
heard
of
;
and
they
solemnly
vowed
to
smite
them
with
the
sword
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
the
King
tried
force
,
then
treaty
,
then
a
Scottish
Parliament
which
did
not
answer
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
tried
the
EARL
OF
STRAFFORD
,
formerly
Sir
Thomas
Wentworth
;
who
,
as
LORD
WENTWORTH
,
had
been
governing
Ireland
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
had
carried
it
with
a
very
high
hand
there
,
though
to
the
benefit
and
prosperity
of
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
Strafford
and
Laud
were
for
conquering
the
Scottish
people
by
force
of
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Other
lords
who
were
taken
into
council
,
recommended
that
a
Parliament
should
at
last
be
called
;
to
which
the
King
unwillingly
consented
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
on
the
thirteenth
of
April
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
,
that
then
strange
sight
,
a
Parliament
,
was
seen
at
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
called
the
Short
Parliament
,
for
it
lasted
a
very
little
while
.
 
<EOS>
While
the
members
were
all
looking
at
one
another
,
doubtful
who
would
dare
to
speak
,
MR
.
<EOS>
PYM
arose
and
set
forth
all
that
the
King
had
done
unlawfully
during
the
past
twelve
years
,
and
what
was
the
position
to
which
England
was
reduced
.
 
<EOS>
This
great
example
set
,
other
members
took
courage
and
spoke
the
truth
freely
,
though
with
great
patience
and
moderation
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
a
little
frightened
,
sent
to
say
that
if
they
would
grant
him
a
certain
sum
on
certain
terms
,
no
more
ship
money
should
be
raised
.
 
<EOS>
They
debated
the
matter
for
two
days
;
and
then
,
as
they
would
not
give
him
all
he
asked
without
promise
or
inquiry
,
he
dissolved
them
.
  
<EOS>
But
they
knew
very
well
that
he
must
have
a
Parliament
now
;
and
he
began
to
make
that
discovery
too
,
though
rather
late
in
the
day
.
<EOS>
Wherefore
,
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
September
,
being
then
at
York
with
an
army
collected
against
the
Scottish
people
,
but
his
own
men
sullen
and
discontented
like
the
rest
of
the
nation
,
the
King
told
the
great
council
of
the
Lords
,
whom
he
had
called
to
meet
him
there
,
that
he
would
summon
another
Parliament
to
assemble
on
the
third
of
November
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
of
the
Covenant
had
now
forced
their
way
into
England
and
had
taken
possession
of
the
northern
counties
,
where
the
coals
are
got
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
would
never
do
to
be
without
coals
,
and
as
the
King
's
troops
could
make
no
head
against
the
Covenanters
so
full
of
gloomy
zeal
,
a
truce
was
made
,
and
a
treaty
with
Scotland
was
taken
into
consideration
.
 
<EOS>
Meanwhile
the
northern
counties
paid
the
Covenanters
to
leave
the
coals
alone
,
and
keep
quiet
.
  
<EOS>
We
have
now
disposed
of
the
Short
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
We
have
next
to
see
what
memorable
things
were
done
by
the
Long
one
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
<EOS>
THE
Long
Parliament
assembled
on
the
third
of
November
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
one
.
 
<EOS>
That
day
week
the
Earl
of
Strafford
arrived
from
York
,
very
sensible
that
the
spirited
and
determined
men
who
formed
that
Parliament
were
no
friends
towards
him
,
who
had
not
only
deserted
the
cause
of
the
people
,
but
who
had
on
all
occasions
opposed
himself
to
their
liberties
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
told
him
,
for
his
comfort
,
that
the
Parliament
"
should
not
hurt
one
hair
of
his
head
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
very
next
day
Mr
Pym
,
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
with
great
solemnity
,
impeached
the
Earl
of
Strafford
as
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
taken
into
custody
and
fell
from
his
proud
height
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
twenty
-
second
of
March
before
he
was
brought
to
trial
in
Westminster
Hall
;
where
,
although
he
was
very
ill
and
suffered
great
pain
,
he
defended
himself
with
such
ability
and
majesty
,
that
it
was
doubtful
whether
he
would
not
get
the
best
of
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
on
the
thirteenth
day
of
the
trial
,
Pym
produced
in
the
House
of
Commons
a
copy
of
some
notes
of
a
council
,
found
by
young
SIR
HARRY
VANE
in
a
red
velvet
cabinet
belonging
to
his
father
(
Secretary
Vane
,
who
sat
at
the
council
-
table
with
the
Earl
)
,
in
which
Strafford
had
distinctly
told
the
King
that
he
was
free
from
all
rules
and
obligations
of
government
,
and
might
do
with
his
people
whatever
he
liked
;
and
in
which
he
had
added
---
"
You
have
an
army
in
Ireland
that
you
may
employ
to
reduce
this
kingdom
to
obedience
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
not
clear
whether
by
the
words
"
<EOS>
this
kingdom
,
"
he
had
really
meant
England
or
Scotland
;
but
the
Parliament
contended
that
he
meant
England
,
and
this
was
treason
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
same
sitting
of
the
House
of
Commons
it
was
resolved
to
bring
in
a
bill
of
attainder
declaring
the
treason
to
have
been
committed
:
 
in
preference
to
proceeding
with
the
trial
by
impeachment
,
which
would
have
required
the
treason
to
be
proved
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
a
bill
was
brought
in
at
once
,
was
carried
through
the
House
of
Commons
by
a
large
majority
,
and
was
sent
up
to
the
House
of
Lords
.
<EOS>
While
it
was
still
uncertain
whether
the
House
of
Lords
would
pass
it
and
the
King
consent
to
it
,
Pym
disclosed
to
the
House
of
Commons
that
the
King
and
Queen
had
both
been
plotting
with
the
officers
of
the
army
to
bring
up
the
soldiers
and
control
the
Parliament
,
and
also
to
introduce
two
hundred
soldiers
into
the
Tower
of
London
to
effect
the
Earl
's
escape
.
 
<EOS>
The
plotting
with
the
army
was
revealed
by
one
GEORGE
GORING
,
the
son
of
a
lord
of
that
name
:
 
a
bad
fellow
who
was
one
of
the
original
plotters
,
and
turned
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
had
actually
given
his
warrant
for
the
admission
of
the
two
hundred
men
into
the
Tower
,
and
they
would
have
got
in
too
,
but
for
the
refusal
of
the
governor
---
a
sturdy
Scotchman
of
the
name
of
BALFOUR
---
to
admit
them
.
 
<EOS>
These
matters
being
made
public
,
great
numbers
of
people
began
to
riot
outside
the
Houses
of
Parliament
,
and
to
cry
out
for
the
execution
of
the
Earl
of
Strafford
,
as
one
of
the
King
's
chief
instruments
against
them
.
 
<EOS>
The
bill
passed
the
House
of
Lords
while
the
people
were
in
this
state
of
agitation
,
and
was
laid
before
the
King
for
his
assent
,
together
with
another
bill
declaring
that
the
Parliament
then
assembled
should
not
be
dissolved
or
adjourned
without
their
own
consent
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
---
not
unwilling
to
save
a
faithful
servant
,
though
he
had
no
great
attachment
for
him
---
was
in
some
doubt
what
to
do
;
but
he
gave
his
consent
to
both
bills
,
although
he
in
his
heart
believed
that
the
bill
against
the
Earl
of
Strafford
was
unlawful
and
unjust
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
had
written
to
him
,
telling
him
that
he
was
willing
to
die
for
his
sake
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
not
expected
that
his
royal
master
would
take
him
at
his
word
quite
so
readily
;
for
,
when
he
heard
his
doom
,
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
,
and
said
,
"
Put
not
your
trust
in
Princes
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
never
could
be
straightforward
and
plain
,
through
one
single
day
or
through
one
single
sheet
of
paper
,
wrote
a
letter
to
the
Lords
,
and
sent
it
by
the
young
Prince
of
Wales
,
entreating
them
to
prevail
with
the
Commons
that
"
that
unfortunate
man
should
fulfil
the
natural
course
of
his
life
in
a
close
imprisonment
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
a
postscript
to
the
very
same
letter
,
he
added
,
"
If
he
must
die
,
it
were
charity
to
reprieve
him
till
Saturday
.
<EOS>
"
 
If
there
had
been
any
doubt
of
his
fate
,
this
weakness
and
meanness
would
have
settled
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
very
next
day
,
which
was
the
twelfth
of
May
,
he
was
brought
out
to
be
beheaded
on
Tower
Hill
.
  
<EOS>
Archbishop
Laud
,
who
had
been
so
fond
of
having
people
's
ears
cropped
off
and
their
noses
slit
,
was
now
confined
in
the
Tower
too
;
and
when
the
Earl
went
by
his
window
to
his
death
,
he
was
there
,
at
his
request
,
to
give
him
his
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
been
great
friends
in
the
King
's
cause
,
and
the
Earl
had
written
to
him
in
the
days
of
their
power
that
he
thought
it
would
be
an
admirable
thing
to
have
Mr
Hampden
publicly
whipped
for
refusing
to
pay
the
ship
money
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
those
high
and
mighty
doings
were
over
now
,
and
the
Earl
went
his
way
to
death
with
dignity
and
heroism
.
 
<EOS>
The
governor
wished
him
to
get
into
a
coach
at
the
Tower
gate
,
for
fear
the
people
should
tear
him
to
pieces
;
but
he
said
it
was
all
one
to
him
whether
he
died
by
the
axe
or
by
the
people
's
hands
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
walked
,
with
a
firm
tread
and
a
stately
look
,
and
sometimes
pulled
off
his
hat
to
them
as
he
passed
along
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
profoundly
quiet
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
speech
on
the
scaffold
from
some
notes
he
had
prepared
(
the
paper
was
found
lying
there
after
his
head
was
struck
off
)
,
and
one
blow
of
the
axe
killed
him
,
in
the
forty
-
ninth
year
of
his
age
.
  
<EOS>
This
bold
and
daring
act
,
the
Parliament
accompanied
by
other
famous
measures
,
all
originating
(
as
even
this
did
)
in
the
King
's
having
so
grossly
and
so
long
abused
his
power
.
 
<EOS>
The
name
of
DELINQUENTS
was
applied
to
all
sheriffs
and
other
officers
who
had
been
concerned
in
raising
the
ship
money
,
or
any
other
money
,
from
the
people
,
in
an
unlawful
manner
;
the
Hampden
judgment
was
reversed
;
the
judges
who
had
decided
against
Hampden
were
called
upon
to
give
large
securities
that
they
would
take
such
consequences
as
Parliament
might
impose
upon
them
;
and
one
was
arrested
as
he
sat
in
High
Court
,
and
carried
off
to
prison
.
 
<EOS>
Laud
was
impeached
;
the
unfortunate
victims
whose
ears
had
been
cropped
and
whose
noses
had
been
slit
,
were
brought
out
of
prison
in
triumph
;
and
a
bill
was
passed
declaring
that
a
Parliament
should
be
called
every
third
year
,
and
that
if
the
King
and
the
King
's
officers
did
not
call
it
,
the
people
should
assemble
of
themselves
and
summon
it
,
as
of
their
own
right
and
power
.
 
<EOS>
Great
illuminations
and
rejoicings
took
place
over
all
these
things
,
and
the
country
was
wildly
excited
.
 
<EOS>
That
the
Parliament
took
advantage
of
this
excitement
and
stirred
them
up
by
every
means
,
there
is
no
doubt
;
but
you
are
always
to
remember
those
twelve
long
years
,
during
which
the
King
had
tried
so
hard
whether
he
really
could
do
any
wrong
or
not
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
there
was
a
great
religious
outcry
against
the
right
of
the
Bishops
to
sit
in
Parliament
;
to
which
the
Scottish
people
particularly
objected
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
were
divided
on
this
subject
,
and
,
partly
on
this
account
and
partly
because
they
had
had
foolish
expectations
that
the
Parliament
would
be
able
to
take
off
nearly
all
the
taxes
,
numbers
of
them
sometimes
wavered
and
inclined
towards
the
King
.
  
<EOS>
I
believe
myself
,
that
if
,
at
this
or
almost
any
other
period
of
his
life
,
the
King
could
have
been
trusted
by
any
man
not
out
of
his
senses
,
he
might
have
saved
himself
and
kept
his
throne
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
on
the
English
army
being
disbanded
,
he
plotted
with
the
officers
again
,
as
he
had
done
before
,
and
established
the
fact
beyond
all
doubt
by
putting
his
signature
of
approval
to
a
petition
against
the
Parliamentary
leaders
,
which
was
drawn
up
by
certain
officers
.
<EOS>
When
the
Scottish
army
was
disbanded
,
he
went
to
Edinburgh
in
four
days
---
which
was
going
very
fast
at
that
time
---
to
plot
again
,
and
so
darkly
too
,
that
it
is
difficult
to
decide
what
his
whole
object
was
.
 
<EOS>
Some
suppose
that
he
wanted
to
gain
over
the
Scottish
Parliament
,
as
he
did
in
fact
gain
over
,
by
presents
and
favours
,
many
Scottish
lords
and
men
of
power
.
 
<EOS>
Some
think
that
he
went
to
get
proofs
against
the
Parliamentary
leaders
in
England
of
their
having
treasonably
invited
the
Scottish
people
to
come
and
help
them
.
 
<EOS>
With
whatever
object
he
went
to
Scotland
,
he
did
little
good
by
going
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
instigation
of
the
EARL
OF
MONTROSE
,
a
desperate
man
who
was
then
in
prison
for
plotting
,
he
tried
to
kidnap
three
Scottish
lords
who
escaped
.
 
<EOS>
A
committee
of
the
Parliament
at
home
,
who
had
followed
to
watch
him
,
writing
an
account
of
this
INCIDENT
,
as
it
was
called
,
to
the
Parliament
<EOS>
,
the
Parliament
made
a
fresh
stir
about
it
;
were
,
or
feigned
to
be
,
much
alarmed
for
themselves
;
and
wrote
to
the
EARL
OF
ESSEX
,
the
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
for
a
guard
to
protect
them
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
not
absolutely
proved
that
the
King
plotted
in
Ireland
besides
,
but
it
is
very
probable
that
he
did
,
and
that
the
Queen
did
,
and
that
he
had
some
wild
hope
of
gaining
the
Irish
people
over
to
his
side
by
favouring
a
rise
among
them
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
or
no
,
they
did
rise
in
a
most
brutal
and
savage
rebellion
;
in
which
,
encouraged
by
their
priests
,
they
committed
such
atrocities
upon
numbers
of
the
English
,
of
both
sexes
and
of
all
ages
,
as
nobody
could
believe
,
but
for
their
being
related
on
oath
by
eye
-
witnesses
.
<EOS>
Whether
one
hundred
thousand
or
two
hundred
thousand
Protestants
were
murdered
in
this
outbreak
,
is
uncertain
;
but
,
that
it
was
as
ruthless
and
barbarous
an
outbreak
as
ever
was
known
among
any
savage
people
,
is
certain
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
came
home
from
Scotland
,
determined
to
make
a
great
struggle
for
his
lost
power
.
 
<EOS>
He
believed
that
,
through
his
presents
and
favours
,
Scotland
would
take
no
part
against
him
;
and
the
Lord
Mayor
of
London
received
him
with
such
a
magnificent
dinner
that
he
thought
he
must
have
become
popular
again
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
take
a
good
many
Lord
Mayors
,
however
,
to
make
a
people
,
and
the
King
soon
found
himself
mistaken
.
  
<EOS>
Not
so
soon
,
though
,
but
that
there
was
a
great
opposition
in
the
Parliament
to
a
celebrated
paper
put
forth
by
Pym
and
Hampden
and
the
rest
,
called
"
THE
REMONSTRANCE
,
"
which
set
forth
all
the
illegal
acts
that
the
King
had
ever
done
,
but
politely
laid
the
blame
of
them
on
his
bad
advisers
.
 
<EOS>
Even
when
it
was
passed
and
presented
to
him
,
the
King
still
thought
himself
strong
enough
to
discharge
Balfour
from
his
command
in
the
Tower
,
and
to
put
in
his
place
a
man
of
bad
character
;
to
whom
the
Commons
instantly
objected
,
and
whom
he
was
obliged
to
abandon
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
time
,
the
old
outcry
about
the
Bishops
became
louder
than
ever
,
and
the
old
Archbishop
of
York
was
so
near
being
murdered
as
he
went
down
to
the
House
of
Lords
---
being
laid
hold
of
by
the
mob
and
violently
knocked
about
,
in
return
for
very
foolishly
scolding
a
shrill
boy
who
was
yelping
out
"
No
Bishops
!
"
<EOS>
---
that
he
sent
for
all
the
Bishops
who
were
in
town
,
and
proposed
to
them
to
sign
a
declaration
that
,
as
they
could
no
longer
without
danger
to
their
lives
attend
their
duty
in
Parliament
,
they
protested
against
the
lawfulness
of
everything
done
in
their
absence
.
 
<EOS>
This
they
asked
the
King
to
send
to
the
House
of
Lords
,
which
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
House
of
Commons
impeached
the
whole
party
of
Bishops
and
sent
them
off
to
the
Tower
:
  
<EOS>
Taking
no
warning
from
this
;
but
encouraged
by
there
being
a
moderate
party
in
the
Parliament
who
objected
to
these
strong
measures
,
the
King
,
on
the
third
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
two
,
took
the
rashest
step
that
ever
was
taken
by
mortal
man
.
  
<EOS>
Of
his
own
accord
and
without
advice
,
he
sent
the
Attorney
-
General
to
the
House
of
Lords
,
to
accuse
of
treason
certain
members
of
Parliament
who
as
popular
leaders
were
the
most
obnoxious
to
him
;
LORD
KIMBOLTON
,
SIR
ARTHUR
HASELRIG
,
DENZIL
HOLLIS
,
JOHN
PYM
(
they
used
to
call
him
King
Pym
,
he
possessed
such
power
and
looked
so
big
)
,
JOHN
HAMPDEN
,
and
WILLIAM
STRODE
.
 
<EOS>
The
houses
of
those
members
he
caused
to
be
entered
,
and
their
papers
to
be
sealed
up
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
sent
a
messenger
to
the
House
of
Commons
demanding
to
have
the
five
gentlemen
who
were
members
of
that
House
immediately
produced
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
the
House
replied
that
they
should
appear
as
soon
as
there
was
any
legal
charge
against
them
,
and
immediately
adjourned
.
  
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
House
of
Commons
send
into
the
City
to
let
the
Lord
Mayor
know
that
their
privileges
are
invaded
by
the
King
,
and
that
there
is
no
safety
for
anybody
or
anything
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
five
members
are
gone
out
of
the
way
,
down
comes
the
King
himself
,
with
all
his
guard
and
from
two
to
three
hundred
gentlemen
and
soldiers
,
of
whom
the
greater
part
were
armed
.
 
<EOS>
These
he
leaves
in
the
hall
;
and
<EOS>
then
,
with
his
nephew
at
his
side
,
goes
into
the
House
,
takes
off
his
hat
,
and
walks
up
to
the
Speaker
's
chair
.
 
<EOS>
The
Speaker
leaves
it
,
the
King
stands
in
front
of
it
,
looks
about
him
steadily
for
a
little
while
,
and
says
he
has
come
for
those
five
members
.
<EOS>
No
one
speaks
,
and
then
he
calls
John
Pym
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
speaks
,
and
then
he
calls
Denzil
Hollis
by
name
.
 
<EOS>
No
one
speaks
,
and
then
he
asks
the
Speaker
of
the
House
where
those
five
members
are
?
 
<EOS>
The
Speaker
,
answering
on
his
knee
,
nobly
replies
that
he
is
the
servant
of
that
House
,
and
that
he
has
neither
eyes
to
see
,
nor
tongue
to
speak
,
anything
but
<EOS>
what
the
House
commands
him
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
King
,
beaten
from
that
time
evermore
,
replies
that
he
will
seek
them
himself
,
for
they
have
committed
treason
;
and
goes
out
,
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
amid
some
audible
murmurs
from
the
members
.
  
<EOS>
No
words
can
describe
the
hurry
that
arose
out
of
doors
when
all
this
was
known
.
 
<EOS>
The
five
members
had
gone
for
safety
to
a
house
in
Coleman
-
street
,
in
the
City
,
where
they
were
guarded
all
night
;
and
indeed
the
whole
city
watched
in
arms
like
an
army
.
 
<EOS>
At
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
King
,
already
frightened
at
what
he
had
done
,
came
to
the
Guildhall
,
with
only
half
a
dozen
lords
,
and
made
a
speech
to
the
people
,
hoping
they
would
not
shelter
those
whom
he
accused
of
treason
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
,
he
issued
a
proclamation
for
the
apprehension
of
the
five
members
;
but
the
Parliament
minded
it
so
little
that
they
made
great
arrangements
for
having
them
brought
down
to
Westminster
in
great
state
,
five
days
afterwards
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
so
alarmed
now
at
his
own
imprudence
,
if
not
for
his
own
safety
,
that
he
left
his
palace
at
Whitehall
,
and
went
away
with
his
Queen
and
children
to
Hampton
Court
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
eleventh
of
May
,
when
the
five
members
were
carried
in
state
and
triumph
to
Westminster
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
taken
by
water
.
 
<EOS>
The
river
could
not
be
seen
for
the
boats
on
it
;
and
the
five
members
were
hemmed
in
by
barges
full
of
men
and
great
guns
,
ready
to
protect
them
,
at
any
cost
.
 
<EOS>
Along
the
Strand
<EOS>
a
large
body
of
the
train
-
bands
of
London
,
under
their
commander
,
SKIPPON
,
marched
to
be
ready
to
assist
the
little
fleet
.
 
<EOS>
Beyond
them
,
came
a
crowd
who
choked
the
streets
,
roaring
incessantly
about
the
Bishops
and
the
Papists
,
and
crying
out
contemptuously
as
they
passed
Whitehall
,
"
What
has
become
of
the
King
?
"
 
<EOS>
With
this
great
noise
outside
the
House
of
Commons
,
and
with
great
silence
within
,
Mr
Pym
rose
and
informed
the
House
of
the
great
kindness
with
which
they
had
been
received
in
the
City
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
the
House
called
the
sheriffs
in
and
thanked
them
,
and
requested
the
train
-
bands
,
under
their
commander
Skippon
,
to
guard
the
House
of
Commons
every
day
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
came
four
thousand
men
on
horseback
out
of
Buckinghamshire
,
offering
their
services
as
a
guard
too
,
and
bearing
a
petition
to
the
King
,
complaining
of
the
injury
that
had
been
done
to
Mr
Hampden
,
who
was
their
county
man
and
much
beloved
and
honoured
.
  
<EOS>
When
the
King
set
off
for
Hampton
Court
,
the
gentlemen
and
soldiers
who
had
been
with
him
followed
him
out
of
town
as
far
as
Kingston
-
upon
-
Thames
;
next
day
,
Lord
Digby
came
to
them
from
the
King
at
Hampton
Court
,
in
his
coach
and
six
,
to
inform
them
that
the
King
accepted
their
protection
.
 
<EOS>
This
,
the
Parliament
said
,
was
making
war
against
the
kingdom
,
and
Lord
Digby
fled
abroad
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
then
immediately
applied
themselves
to
getting
hold
of
the
military
power
of
the
country
,
well
knowing
that
the
King
was
already
trying
hard
to
use
it
against
them
,
and
that
he
had
secretly
sent
the
Earl
of
Newcastle
to
Hull
,
to
secure
a
valuable
magazine
of
arms
and
gunpowder
that
was
there
.
 
<EOS>
In
those
times
,
every
county
had
its
own
magazines
of
arms
and
powder
,
for
its
own
train
-
bands
or
militia
;
so
,
the
Parliament
brought
in
a
bill
claiming
the
right
(
which
up
to
this
time
had
belonged
to
the
King
)
of
appointing
the
Lord
Lieutenants
of
counties
,
who
commanded
these
train
-
bands
;
also
,
of
having
all
the
forts
,
castles
,
and
garrisons
in
the
kingdom
,
put
into
the
hands
of
such
governors
as
they
,
the
Parliament
,
could
confide
in
.
 
<EOS>
It
also
passed
a
law
depriving
the
Bishops
of
their
votes
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
gave
his
assent
to
that
bill
,
but
would
not
abandon
the
right
of
appointing
the
Lord
Lieutenants
,
though
he
said
he
was
willing
to
appoint
such
as
might
be
suggested
to
him
by
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Earl
of
Pembroke
asked
him
whether
he
would
not
give
way
on
that
question
for
a
time
,
he
said
,
"
By
God
!
<EOS>
not
for
one
hour
!
"
<EOS>
and
upon
this
he
and
the
Parliament
went
to
war
.
  
<EOS>
His
young
daughter
was
betrothed
to
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
 
<EOS>
On
pretence
of
taking
her
to
the
country
of
her
future
husband
,
the
Queen
was
already
got
safely
away
to
Holland
,
there
to
pawn
the
Crown
jewels
for
money
to
raise
an
army
on
the
King
's
side
.
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
Admiral
being
sick
,
the
House
of
Commons
now
named
the
Earl
of
Warwick
to
hold
his
place
for
a
year
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
named
another
gentleman
;
the
House
of
Commons
took
its
own
way
,
and
the
Earl
of
Warwick
became
Lord
Admiral
without
the
King
's
consent
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
sent
orders
down
to
Hull
to
have
that
magazine
removed
to
London
;
the
King
went
down
to
Hull
to
take
it
himself
.
 
<EOS>
The
citizens
would
not
admit
him
into
the
town
,
and
the
governor
would
not
admit
him
into
the
castle
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
resolved
that
whatever
the
two
Houses
passed
,
and
the
King
would
not
consent
to
,
should
be
called
an
ORDINANCE
,
and
should
be
as
much
a
law
as
if
he
did
consent
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
protested
against
this
,
and
gave
notice
that
these
ordinances
were
not
to
be
obeyed
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
attended
by
the
majority
of
the
House
of
Peers
,
and
by
many
members
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
established
himself
at
York
.
 
<EOS>
The
Chancellor
went
to
him
with
the
Great
Seal
,
and
the
Parliament
made
a
new
Great
Seal
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
sent
over
a
ship
full
of
arms
and
ammunition
,
and
the
King
issued
letters
to
borrow
money
at
high
interest
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
raised
twenty
regiments
of
foot
and
seventy
-
five
troops
of
horse
;
and
the
people
willingly
aided
them
with
their
money
,
plate
,
jewellery
,
and
trinkets
---
the
married
women
even
with
their
wedding
-
rings
.
 
<EOS>
Every
member
of
Parliament
who
could
raise
a
troop
or
a
regiment
in
his
own
part
of
the
country
,
dressed
it
according
to
his
taste
and
in
his
own
colours
,
and
commanded
it
.
 
<EOS>
Foremost
among
them
all
,
OLIVER
CROMWELL
raised
a
troop
of
horse
---
thoroughly
in
earnest
and
thoroughly
well
armed
---
who
were
,
perhaps
,
the
best
soldiers
that
ever
were
seen
.
  
<EOS>
In
some
of
their
proceedings
,
this
famous
Parliament
passed
the
bounds
of
previous
law
and
custom
,
yielded
to
and
favoured
riotous
assemblages
of
the
people
,
and
acted
tyrannically
in
imprisoning
some
who
differed
from
the
popular
leaders
.
 
<EOS>
But
again
,
you
are
always
to
remember
that
the
twelve
years
during
which
the
King
had
had
his
own
wilful
way
,
had
gone
before
;
and
that
nothing
could
make
the
times
what
they
might
,
could
,
would
,
or
should
have
been
,
if
those
twelve
years
had
never
rolled
away
.
  
<EOS>
Third
Part
    
<EOS>
I
SHALL
not
try
to
relate
the
particulars
of
the
great
civil
war
between
King
Charles
the
First
and
the
Long
Parliament
,
which
lasted
nearly
four
years
,
and
a
full
account
of
which
would
fill
many
large
books
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
thing
that
Englishmen
should
once
more
be
fighting
against
Englishmen
on
English
ground
;
but
,
it
is
some
consolation
to
know
that
on
both
sides
there
was
great
humanity
,
forbearance
,
and
honour
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
of
the
Parliament
were
far
more
remarkable
for
these
good
qualities
than
the
soldiers
of
the
King
(
many
of
whom
fought
for
mere
pay
without
much
caring
for
the
cause
)
;
but
those
of
the
nobility
and
gentry
who
were
on
the
King
's
side
were
so
brave
,
and
so
faithful
to
him
,
that
their
conduct
can
not
but
command
our
highest
admiration
.
 
<EOS>
Among
them
were
great
numbers
of
Catholics
,
who
took
the
royal
side
because
the
Queen
was
so
strongly
of
their
persuasion
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
might
have
distinguished
some
of
these
gallant
spirits
,
if
he
had
been
as
generous
a
spirit
himself
,
by
giving
them
the
command
of
his
army
.
 
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
,
however
,
true
to
his
old
high
notions
of
royalty
,
he
entrusted
it
to
his
two
nephews
,
PRINCE
RUPERT
and
PRINCE
MAURICE
,
who
were
of
royal
blood
and
came
over
from
abroad
to
help
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
have
been
better
for
him
if
they
had
stayed
away
;
since
Prince
Rupert
was
an
impetuous
,
hot
-
headed
fellow
,
whose
only
idea
was
to
dash
into
battle
at
all
times
and
seasons
,
and
lay
about
him
.
  
<EOS>
The
general
-
in
-
chief
of
the
Parliamentary
army
was
the
Earl
of
Essex
,
a
gentleman
of
honour
and
an
excellent
soldier
.
 
<EOS>
A
little
while
before
the
war
broke
out
,
there
had
been
some
rioting
at
Westminster
between
certain
officious
law
students
and
noisy
soldiers
,
and
the
shopkeepers
and
their
apprentices
,
and
the
general
people
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
At
that
time
the
King
's
friends
called
the
crowd
,
Roundheads
,
because
the
apprentices
wore
short
hair
;
the
crowd
,
in
return
,
called
their
opponents
Cavaliers
,
meaning
that
they
were
a
blustering
set
,
who
pretended
to
be
very
military
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
words
now
began
to
be
used
to
distinguish
the
two
sides
in
the
civil
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
Royalists
also
called
the
Parliamentary
men
Rebels
and
Rogues
,
while
the
Parliamentary
men
called
THEM
Malignants
,
and
spoke
of
themselves
as
the
Godly
,
the
Honest
,
and
so
forth
.
  
<EOS>
The
war
broke
out
at
Portsmouth
,
where
that
double
traitor
Goring
had
again
gone
over
to
the
King
and
was
besieged
by
the
Parliamentary
troops
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
King
proclaimed
the
Earl
of
Essex
and
the
officers
serving
under
him
,
traitors
,
and
called
upon
his
loyal
subjects
to
meet
him
in
arms
at
Nottingham
on
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
August
.
 
<EOS>
But
his
loyal
subjects
came
about
him
in
scanty
numbers
,
and
it
was
a
windy
,
gloomy
day
,
and
the
Royal
Standard
got
blown
down
,
and
the
whole
affair
was
very
melancholy
.
 
<EOS>
The
chief
engagements
after
this
,
took
place
in
the
vale
of
the
Red
Horse
near
Banbury
,
at
Brentford
,
at
Devizes
,
at
Chalgrave
Field
(
where
Mr
Hampden
was
so
sorely
wounded
while
fighting
at
the
head
of
his
men
,
that
he
died
within
a
week
)
,
at
Newbury
(
in
which
battle
LORD
FALKLAND
,
one
of
the
best
noblemen
on
the
King
's
side
,
was
killed
)
,
at
Leicester
,
at
Naseby
,
at
Winchester
,
at
Marston
Moor
near
York
,
at
Newcastle
,
and
in
many
other
parts
of
England
and
Scotland
.
<EOS>
These
battles
were
attended
with
various
successes
.
 
<EOS>
At
one
time
,
the
King
was
victorious
;
at
another
time
,
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
But
almost
all
the
great
and
busy
towns
were
against
the
King
;
and
when
it
was
considered
necessary
to
fortify
London
,
all
ranks
of
people
,
from
labouring
men
and
women
,
up
to
lords
and
ladies
,
worked
hard
together
with
heartiness
and
good
will
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
distinguished
leaders
on
the
Parliamentary
side
were
HAMPDEN
,
SIR
THOMAS
FAIRFAX
,
and
,
above
all
,
OLIVER
CROMWELL
,
and
his
son
-
in
-
law
IRETON
.
  
<EOS>
During
the
whole
of
this
war
,
the
people
,
to
whom
it
was
very
expensive
and
irksome
,
and
to
whom
it
was
made
the
more
distressing
by
almost
every
family
being
divided
---
some
of
its
members
attaching
themselves
to
one
side
and
some
to
the
other
---
were
over
and
over
again
most
anxious
for
peace
.
 
<EOS>
So
were
some
of
the
best
men
in
each
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
treaties
of
peace
were
discussed
between
commissioners
from
the
Parliament
and
the
King
;
at
York
,
at
Oxford
(
where
the
King
held
a
little
Parliament
of
his
own
)
,
and
at
Uxbridge
.
 
<EOS>
But
they
came
to
nothing
.
 
<EOS>
In
all
these
negotiations
,
and
in
all
his
difficulties
,
the
King
showed
himself
at
his
best
.
<EOS>
He
was
courageous
,
cool
,
self
-
possessed
,
and
clever
;
but
,
the
old
taint
of
his
character
was
always
in
him
,
and
he
was
never
for
one
single
moment
to
be
trusted
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Clarendon
,
the
historian
,
one
of
his
highest
admirers
,
supposes
that
he
had
unhappily
promised
the
Queen
never
to
make
peace
without
her
consent
,
and
that
this
must
often
be
taken
as
his
excuse
.
 
<EOS>
He
never
kept
his
word
from
night
to
morning
.
 
<EOS>
He
signed
a
cessation
of
hostilities
with
the
blood
-
stained
Irish
rebels
for
a
sum
of
money
,
and
invited
the
Irish
regiments
over
,
to
help
him
against
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
battle
of
Naseby
,
his
cabinet
was
seized
and
was
found
to
contain
a
correspondence
with
the
Queen
,
in
which
he
expressly
told
her
that
he
had
deceived
the
Parliament
---
a
mongrel
Parliament
,
he
called
it
now
,
as
an
improvement
on
his
old
term
of
vipers
---
in
pretending
to
recognise
it
and
to
treat
with
it
;
and
from
which
it
further
appeared
that
he
had
long
been
in
secret
treaty
with
the
Duke
of
Lorraine
for
a
foreign
army
of
ten
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
this
,
he
sent
a
most
devoted
friend
of
his
,
the
EARL
OF
GLAMORGAN
,
to
Ireland
,
to
conclude
a
secret
treaty
with
the
Catholic
powers
,
to
send
him
an
Irish
army
of
ten
thousand
men
;
in
return
for
which
he
was
to
bestow
great
favours
on
the
Catholic
religion
.
 
<EOS>
And
,
when
this
treaty
was
discovered
in
the
carriage
of
a
fighting
Irish
Archbishop
who
was
killed
in
one
of
the
many
skirmishes
of
those
days
,
he
basely
denied
and
deserted
his
attached
friend
,
the
Earl
,
on
his
being
charged
with
high
treason
;
and
---
even
worse
than
this
---
<EOS>
had
left
blanks
in
the
secret
instructions
he
gave
him
with
his
own
kingly
hand
,
expressly
that
he
might
thus
save
himself
.
  
<EOS>
At
last
,
on
the
twenty
-
seventh
day
of
April
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
six
,
the
King
found
himself
in
the
city
of
Oxford
,
so
surrounded
by
the
Parliamentary
army
who
were
closing
in
upon
him
on
all
sides
that
he
felt
that
if
he
would
escape
he
must
delay
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
that
night
,
having
altered
the
cut
of
his
hair
and
beard
,
he
was
dressed
up
as
a
servant
and
put
upon
a
horse
with
a
cloak
strapped
behind
him
,
and
rode
out
of
the
town
behind
one
of
his
own
faithful
followers
,
with
a
clergyman
of
that
country
who
knew
the
road
well
,
for
a
guide
.
 
<EOS>
He
rode
towards
London
as
far
as
Harrow
,
and
then
altered
his
plans
and
resolved
,
it
would
seem
,
to
go
to
the
Scottish
camp
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
men
had
been
invited
over
to
help
the
Parliamentary
army
,
and
had
a
large
force
then
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
so
desperately
intriguing
in
everything
he
did
,
that
it
is
doubtful
what
he
exactly
meant
by
this
step
.
 
<EOS>
He
took
it
,
anyhow
,
and
delivered
himself
up
to
the
EARL
OF
LEVEN
,
the
Scottish
general
-
in
-
chief
,
who
treated
him
as
an
honourable
prisoner
.
 
<EOS>
Negotiations
between
the
Parliament
on
the
one
hand
and
the
Scottish
authorities
on
the
other
,
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
him
,
lasted
until
the
following
February
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
when
the
King
had
refused
to
the
Parliament
the
concession
of
that
old
militia
point
for
twenty
years
,
and
had
refused
to
Scotland
the
recognition
of
its
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
,
Scotland
got
a
handsome
sum
for
its
army
and
its
help
,
and
the
King
into
the
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
taken
,
by
certain
Parliamentary
commissioners
appointed
to
receive
him
,
to
one
of
his
own
houses
,
called
Holmby
House
,
near
Althorpe
,
in
Northamptonshire
.
  
<EOS>
While
the
Civil
War
was
still
in
progress
,
John
Pym
died
,
and
was
buried
with
great
honour
in
Westminster
Abbey
---
not
with
greater
honour
than
he
deserved
,
for
the
liberties
of
Englishmen
owe
a
mighty
debt
to
Pym
and
Hampden
.
 
<EOS>
The
war
was
but
newly
over
when
the
Earl
of
Essex
died
,
of
an
illness
brought
on
by
his
having
overheated
himself
in
a
stag
hunt
in
Windsor
Forest
.
 
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
was
buried
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
with
great
state
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
it
were
not
necessary
to
add
that
Archbishop
Laud
died
upon
the
scaffold
when
the
war
was
not
yet
done
.
 
<EOS>
His
trial
lasted
in
all
nearly
a
year
,
and
,
it
being
doubtful
even
then
whether
the
charges
brought
against
him
amounted
to
treason
,
the
odious
old
contrivance
of
the
worst
kings
was
resorted
to
,
and
a
bill
of
attainder
was
brought
in
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
violently
prejudiced
and
mischievous
person
;
had
had
strong
ear
-
cropping
and
nose
-
splitting
propensities
,
as
you
know
;
and
had
done
a
world
of
harm
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
died
peaceably
,
and
like
a
brave
old
man
.
  
<EOS>
Fourth
Part
    
WHEN
the
Parliament
had
got
the
King
into
their
hands
,
they
became
very
anxious
to
get
rid
of
their
army
,
in
which
Oliver
Cromwell
had
begun
to
acquire
great
power
;
not
only
because
of
his
courage
and
high
abilities
,
but
because
he
professed
to
be
very
sincere
in
the
Scottish
sort
of
Puritan
religion
that
was
then
exceedingly
popular
among
the
soldiers
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
as
much
opposed
to
the
Bishops
as
to
the
Pope
himself
;
and
the
very
privates
,
drummers
,
and
trumpeters
,
had
such
an
inconvenient
habit
of
starting
up
and
preaching
long
-
winded
discourses
,
that
I
would
not
have
belonged
to
that
army
on
any
account
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
the
Parliament
,
being
far
from
sure
but
that
the
army
might
begin
to
preach
and
fight
against
them
now
<EOS>
it
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
proposed
to
disband
the
greater
part
of
it
,
to
send
another
part
to
serve
in
Ireland
against
the
rebels
,
and
to
keep
only
a
small
force
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
army
would
not
consent
to
be
broken
up
,
except
upon
its
own
conditions
;
and
,
when
the
Parliament
showed
an
intention
of
compelling
it
,
it
acted
for
itself
in
an
unexpected
manner
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
cornet
,
of
the
name
of
JOICE
,
arrived
at
Holmby
House
one
night
,
attended
by
four
hundred
horsemen
,
went
into
the
King
's
room
with
his
hat
in
one
hand
and
a
pistol
in
the
other
,
and
told
the
King
that
he
had
come
to
take
him
away
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
willing
enough
to
go
,
and
only
stipulated
that
he
should
be
publicly
required
to
do
so
next
morning
.
 
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
accordingly
,
he
appeared
on
the
top
of
the
steps
of
the
house
,
and
asked
Comet
Joice
before
his
men
and
the
guard
set
there
by
the
Parliament
,
what
authority
he
had
for
taking
him
away
?
 
<EOS>
To
this
Cornet
Joice
replied
,
"
The
authority
of
the
army
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
Have
you
a
written
commission
?
"
said
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
Joice
,
pointing
to
his
four
hundred
men
on
horseback
,
replied
,
"
That
is
my
commission
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
"
said
the
King
,
smiling
,
as
if
he
were
pleased
,
"
I
never
before
read
such
a
commission
;
but
it
is
written
in
fair
and
legible
characters
.
 
<EOS>
This
is
a
company
of
as
handsome
proper
gentlemen
as
I
have
seen
a
long
while
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
He
was
asked
where
he
would
like
to
live
,
and
he
said
at
Newmarket
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
to
Newmarket
he
and
Cornet
Joice
and
the
four
hundred
horsemen
rode
;
the
King
remarking
,
in
the
same
smiling
way
,
that
he
could
ride
as
far
at
a
spell
as
Cornet
Joice
,
or
any
man
there
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
quite
believed
,
I
think
,
that
the
army
were
his
friends
.
<EOS>
He
said
as
much
to
Fairfax
when
that
general
,
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
Ireton
,
went
to
persuade
him
to
return
to
the
custody
of
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
He
preferred
to
remain
as
he
was
,
and
resolved
to
remain
as
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
And
when
the
army
moved
nearer
and
nearer
London
to
frighten
the
Parliament
into
yielding
to
their
demands
,
they
took
the
King
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
deplorable
thing
that
England
should
be
at
the
mercy
of
a
great
body
of
soldiers
with
arms
in
their
hands
;
but
the
King
certainly
favoured
them
at
this
important
time
of
his
life
,
as
compared
with
the
more
lawful
power
that
tried
to
control
him
.
 
<EOS>
It
must
be
added
,
however
,
that
they
treated
him
,
as
yet
,
more
respectfully
and
kindly
than
the
Parliament
had
done
.
<EOS>
They
allowed
him
to
be
attended
by
his
own
servants
,
to
be
splendidly
entertained
at
various
houses
,
and
to
see
his
children
---
at
Cavesham
House
,
near
Reading
---
for
two
days
.
 
<EOS>
Whereas
,
the
Parliament
had
been
rather
hard
with
him
,
and
had
only
allowed
him
to
ride
out
and
play
at
bowls
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
much
to
be
believed
that
if
the
King
could
have
been
trusted
,
even
at
this
time
,
he
might
have
been
saved
.
 
<EOS>
Even
Oliver
Cromwell
expressly
said
that
he
did
believe
that
no
man
could
enjoy
his
possessions
in
peace
,
unless
the
King
had
his
rights
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
not
unfriendly
towards
the
King
;
he
had
been
present
when
he
received
his
children
,
and
had
been
much
affected
by
the
pitiable
nature
of
the
scene
;
he
saw
the
King
often
;
he
frequently
walked
and
talked
with
him
in
the
long
galleries
and
pleasant
gardens
of
the
Palace
at
Hampton
Court
,
whither
he
was
now
removed
;
and
in
all
this
risked
something
of
his
influence
with
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
King
was
in
secret
hopes
of
help
from
the
Scottish
people
;
and
the
moment
he
was
encouraged
to
join
them
he
began
to
be
cool
to
his
new
friends
,
the
army
,
and
to
tell
the
officers
that
they
could
not
possibly
do
without
him
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
very
time
,
too
,
when
he
was
promising
to
make
Cromwell
and
Ireton
noblemen
,
if
they
would
help
him
up
to
his
old
height
,
he
was
writing
to
the
Queen
that
he
meant
to
hang
them
.
<EOS>
They
both
afterwards
declared
that
they
had
been
privately
informed
that
such
a
letter
would
be
found
,
on
a
certain
evening
,
sewed
up
in
a
saddle
which
would
be
taken
to
the
Blue
Boar
in
Holborn
to
be
sent
to
Dover
;
and
that
they
went
there
,
disguised
as
common
soldiers
,
and
sat
drinking
in
the
inn
-
yard
until
a
man
came
with
the
saddle
,
which
they
ripped
up
with
their
knives
,
and
therein
found
the
letter
.
 
<EOS>
I
see
little
reason
to
doubt
the
story
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
certain
that
Oliver
Cromwell
told
one
of
the
King
's
most
faithful
followers
that
the
King
could
not
be
trusted
,
and
that
he
would
not
be
answerable
if
anything
amiss
were
to
happen
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
even
after
that
,
he
kept
a
promise
he
had
made
to
the
King
,
by
letting
him
know
that
there
was
a
plot
with
a
certain
portion
of
the
army
to
seize
him
.
 
<EOS>
I
believe
that
,
in
fact
,
he
sincerely
wanted
the
King
to
escape
abroad
,
and
so
to
be
got
rid
of
without
more
trouble
or
danger
.
 
<EOS>
That
Oliver
himself
had
work
enough
with
the
army
<EOS>
is
pretty
plain
;
for
some
of
the
troops
were
so
mutinous
against
him
,
and
against
those
who
acted
with
him
at
this
time
,
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
have
one
man
shot
at
the
head
of
his
regiment
to
overawe
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
,
when
he
received
Oliver
's
warning
,
made
his
escape
from
Hampton
Court
;
after
some
indecision
and
uncertainty
,
he
went
to
Carisbrooke
Castle
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
 
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
was
pretty
free
there
;
but
,
even
there
,
he
carried
on
a
pretended
treaty
with
the
Parliament
,
while
he
was
really
treating
with
commissioners
from
Scotland
to
send
an
army
into
England
to
take
his
part
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
broke
off
this
treaty
with
the
Parliament
(
having
settled
with
Scotland
)
and
was
treated
as
a
prisoner
,
his
treatment
was
not
changed
too
soon
,
for
he
had
plotted
to
escape
that
very
night
to
a
ship
sent
by
the
Queen
,
which
was
lying
off
the
island
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
doomed
to
be
disappointed
in
his
hopes
from
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
The
agreement
he
had
made
with
the
Scottish
Commissioners
was
not
favourable
enough
to
the
religion
of
that
country
to
please
the
Scottish
clergy
;
and
they
preached
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
was
,
that
the
army
raised
in
Scotland
and
sent
over
,
was
too
small
to
do
much
;
and
that
,
although
it
was
helped
by
a
rising
of
the
Royalists
in
England
and
by
good
soldiers
from
Ireland
,
it
could
make
no
head
against
the
Parliamentary
army
under
such
men
as
Cromwell
and
Fairfax
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
eldest
son
,
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
came
over
from
Holland
with
nineteen
ships
(
a
part
of
the
English
fleet
having
gone
over
to
him
)
to
help
his
father
;
but
nothing
came
of
his
voyage
,
and
he
was
fain
to
return
.
 
<EOS>
The
most
remarkable
event
of
this
second
civil
war
was
the
cruel
execution
by
the
Parliamentary
General
,
of
SIR
CHARLES
LUCAS
and
SIR
GEORGE
LISLE
,
two
grand
Royalist
generals
,
who
had
bravely
defended
Colchester
under
every
disadvantage
of
famine
and
distress
for
nearly
three
months
.
 
<EOS>
When
Sir
Charles
Lucas
was
shot
,
Sir
George
Lisle
kissed
his
body
,
and
said
to
the
soldiers
who
were
to
shoot
him
,
"
Come
nearer
,
and
make
sure
of
me
.
"
 
<EOS>
"
I
warrant
you
,
Sir
George
,
"
said
one
of
the
soldiers
,
"
we
shall
hit
you
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
AY
?
<EOS>
"
he
returned
with
a
smile
,
"
but
I
have
been
nearer
to
you
,
my
friends
,
many
a
time
,
and
you
have
missed
me
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Parliament
,
after
being
fearfully
bullied
by
the
army
---
who
demanded
to
have
seven
members
whom
they
disliked
given
up
to
them
---
had
voted
that
they
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
King
.
<EOS>
On
the
conclusion
,
however
,
of
this
second
civil
war
(
which
did
not
last
more
than
six
months
)
,
they
appointed
commissioners
to
treat
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
then
so
far
released
again
as
to
be
allowed
to
live
in
a
private
house
at
Newport
in
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
managed
his
own
part
of
the
negotiation
with
a
sense
that
was
admired
by
all
who
saw
him
,
and
gave
up
,
in
the
end
,
all
that
was
asked
of
him
---
even
yielding
(
which
he
had
steadily
refused
,
so
far
)
to
the
temporary
abolition
of
the
bishops
,
and
the
transfer
of
their
church
land
to
the
Crown
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
with
his
old
fatal
vice
upon
him
,
when
his
best
friends
joined
the
commissioners
in
beseeching
him
to
yield
all
those
points
as
the
only
means
of
saving
himself
from
the
army
,
he
was
plotting
to
escape
from
the
island
;
he
was
holding
correspondence
with
his
friends
and
the
Catholics
in
Ireland
,
though
declaring
that
he
was
not
;
and
he
was
writing
,
with
his
own
hand
,
that
in
what
he
yielded
he
meant
nothing
but
to
get
time
to
escape
.
  
<EOS>
Matters
were
at
this
pass
when
the
army
,
resolved
to
defy
the
Parliament
,
marched
up
to
London
.
 
<EOS>
The
Parliament
,
not
afraid
of
them
now
,
and
boldly
led
by
Hollis
,
voted
that
the
King
's
concessions
were
sufficient
ground
for
settling
the
peace
of
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
that
,
COLONEL
RICH
and
COLONEL
PRIDE
went
down
to
the
House
of
Commons
with
a
regiment
of
horse
soldiers
and
a
regiment
of
foot
;
and
Colonel
Pride
,
standing
in
the
lobby
with
a
list
of
the
members
who
were
obnoxious
to
the
army
in
his
hand
,
had
them
pointed
out
to
him
as
they
came
through
,
and
took
them
all
into
custody
.
 
<EOS>
This
proceeding
was
afterwards
called
by
the
people
,
for
a
joke
,
PRIDE
'S
PURGE
.
 
<EOS>
Cromwell
was
in
the
North
,
at
the
head
of
his
men
,
at
the
time
,
but
when
he
came
home
,
approved
of
what
had
been
done
.
  
<EOS>
What
with
imprisoning
some
members
and
causing
others
to
stay
away
,
the
army
had
now
reduced
the
House
of
Commons
to
some
fifty
or
so
.
<EOS>
These
soon
voted
that
it
was
treason
in
a
king
to
make
war
against
his
parliament
and
his
people
,
and
sent
an
ordinance
up
to
the
House
of
Lords
for
the
King
's
being
tried
as
a
traitor
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
of
Lords
,
then
sixteen
in
number
,
to
a
man
rejected
it
.
 
<EOS>
Thereupon
,
the
Commons
made
an
ordinance
of
their
own
,
that
they
were
the
supreme
government
of
the
country
,
and
would
bring
the
King
to
trial
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
had
been
taken
for
security
to
a
place
called
Hurst
Castle
:
 
a
lonely
house
on
a
rock
in
the
sea
,
connected
with
the
coast
of
Hampshire
by
a
rough
road
two
miles
long
at
low
water
.
<EOS>
Thence
,
he
was
ordered
to
be
removed
to
Windsor
;
thence
,
after
being
but
rudely
used
there
,
and
having
none
but
soldiers
to
wait
upon
him
at
table
,
he
was
brought
up
to
St
James
's
Palace
in
London
,
and
told
that
his
trial
was
appointed
for
next
day
.
  
<EOS>
On
Saturday
,
the
twentieth
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
forty
-
nine
,
this
memorable
trial
began
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
had
settled
that
one
hundred
and
thirty
-
five
persons
should
form
the
Court
,
and
these
were
taken
from
the
House
itself
,
from
among
the
officers
of
the
army
,
and
from
among
the
lawyers
and
citizens
.
<EOS>
JOHN
BRADSHAW
,
serjeant
-
at
-
law
,
was
appointed
president
.
 
<EOS>
The
place
was
Westminster
Hall
.
 
<EOS>
At
the
upper
end
,
in
a
red
velvet
chair
,
sat
the
president
,
with
his
hat
(
lined
with
plates
of
iron
for
his
protection
)
on
his
head
.
 
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
Court
sat
on
side
benches
,
also
wearing
their
hats
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
seat
was
covered
with
velvet
,
like
that
of
the
president
,
and
was
opposite
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
brought
from
St
James
's
to
Whitehall
,
and
from
Whitehall
he
came
by
water
to
his
trial
.
  
<EOS>
When
he
came
in
,
he
looked
round
very
steadily
on
the
Court
,
and
on
the
great
number
of
spectators
,
and
then
sat
down
:
 
presently
he
got
up
and
looked
round
again
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
indictment
"
against
Charles
Stuart
,
for
high
treason
,
"
being
read
,
he
smiled
several
times
,
and
he
denied
the
authority
of
the
Court
,
saying
that
there
could
be
no
parliament
without
a
House
of
Lords
,
and
that
he
saw
no
House
of
Lords
there
.
 
<EOS>
Also
,
that
the
King
ought
to
be
there
,
and
that
he
saw
no
King
in
the
King
's
right
place
.
 
<EOS>
Bradshaw
replied
,
that
the
Court
was
satisfied
with
its
authority
,
and
that
its
authority
was
God
's
authority
and
the
kingdom
's
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
adjourned
the
Court
to
the
following
Monday
.
 
<EOS>
On
that
day
,
the
trial
was
resumed
,
and
went
on
all
the
week
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Saturday
came
,
as
the
King
passed
forward
to
his
place
in
the
Hall
,
some
soldiers
and
others
cried
for
"
justice
!
"
and
execution
on
him
.
 
<EOS>
That
day
,
too
,
Bradshaw
,
like
an
angry
Sultan
,
wore
a
red
robe
,
instead
of
the
black
robe
he
had
worn
before
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
was
sentenced
to
death
that
day
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
went
out
,
one
solitary
soldier
said
,
"
God
bless
you
,
Sir
!
"
 
<EOS>
For
this
,
his
officer
struck
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
said
he
thought
the
punishment
exceeded
the
offence
.
 
<EOS>
The
silver
head
of
his
walking
-
stick
had
fallen
off
while
he
leaned
upon
it
,
at
one
time
of
the
trial
.
 
<EOS>
The
accident
seemed
to
disturb
him
,
as
if
he
thought
it
ominous
of
the
falling
of
his
own
head
;
and
he
admitted
as
much
,
now
it
was
all
over
.
  
<EOS>
Being
taken
back
to
Whitehall
,
he
sent
to
the
House
of
Commons
,
saying
that
as
the
time
of
his
execution
might
be
nigh
<EOS>
,
he
wished
he
might
be
allowed
to
see
his
darling
children
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
granted
.
<EOS>
On
the
Monday
he
was
taken
back
to
St
James
's
;
and
his
two
children
then
in
England
,
the
PRINCESS
ELIZABETH
thirteen
years
old
,
and
the
DUKE
OF
GLOUCESTER
nine
years
old
,
were
brought
to
take
leave
of
him
,
from
Sion
House
,
near
Brentford
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
sad
and
touching
scene
,
when
he
kissed
and
fondled
those
poor
children
,
and
made
a
little
present
of
two
diamond
seals
to
the
Princess
,
and
gave
them
tender
messages
to
their
mother
(
who
little
deserved
them
,
for
she
had
a
lover
of
her
own
whom
she
married
soon
afterwards
)
,
and
told
them
that
he
died
"
for
the
laws
and
liberties
of
the
land
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
I
am
bound
to
say
that
I
do
n't
think
he
did
,
but
I
dare
say
he
believed
so
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
ambassadors
from
Holland
that
day
,
to
intercede
for
the
unhappy
King
,
whom
you
and
I
both
wish
the
Parliament
had
spared
;
but
they
got
no
answer
.
 
<EOS>
The
Scottish
Commissioners
interceded
too
;
so
did
the
Prince
of
Wales
,
by
a
letter
in
which
he
offered
as
the
next
heir
to
the
throne
,
to
accept
any
conditions
from
the
Parliament
;
so
did
the
Queen
,
by
letter
likewise
.
  
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
,
the
warrant
for
the
execution
was
this
day
signed
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
a
story
that
as
Oliver
Cromwell
went
to
the
table
with
the
pen
in
his
hand
to
put
his
signature
to
it
,
he
drew
his
pen
across
the
face
of
one
of
the
commissioners
,
who
was
standing
near
,
and
marked
it
with
ink
.
 
<EOS>
That
commissioner
had
not
signed
his
own
name
yet
,
and
the
story
adds
that
when
he
came
to
do
it
he
marked
Cromwell
's
face
with
ink
in
the
same
way
.
  
<EOS>
The
King
slept
well
,
untroubled
by
the
knowledge
that
it
was
his
last
night
on
earth
,
and
rose
on
the
thirtieth
of
January
,
two
hours
before
day
,
and
dressed
himself
carefully
.
 
<EOS>
He
put
on
two
shirts
lest
he
should
tremble
with
the
cold
,
and
had
his
hair
very
carefully
combed
.
 
<EOS>
The
warrant
had
been
directed
to
three
officers
of
the
army
,
COLONEL
HACKER
,
COLONEL
HUNKS
,
and
COLONEL
PHAYER
.
 
<EOS>
At
ten
o'clock
,
the
first
of
these
came
to
the
door
and
said
it
was
time
to
go
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
,
who
had
always
been
a
quick
walker
,
walked
at
his
usual
speed
through
the
Park
,
and
called
out
to
the
guard
,
with
his
accustomed
voice
of
command
,
"
March
on
apace
!
"
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
to
Whitehall
,
he
was
taken
to
his
own
bedroom
,
where
a
breakfast
was
set
forth
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
had
taken
the
Sacrament
,
he
would
eat
nothing
more
;
but
,
at
about
the
time
when
the
church
bells
struck
twelve
at
noon
(
for
he
had
to
wait
,
through
the
scaffold
not
being
ready
)
,
he
took
the
advice
of
the
good
BISHOP
JUXON
who
was
with
him
,
and
ate
a
little
bread
and
drank
a
glass
of
claret
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
after
he
had
taken
this
refreshment
,
Colonel
Hacker
came
to
the
chamber
with
the
warrant
in
his
hand
,
and
called
for
Charles
Stuart
.
  
<EOS>
And
then
,
through
the
long
gallery
of
Whitehall
Palace
,
which
he
had
often
seen
light
and
gay
and
merry
and
crowded
,
in
very
different
times
,
the
fallen
King
passed
along
,
until
he
came
to
the
centre
window
of
the
Banqueting
House
,
through
which
he
emerged
upon
the
scaffold
,
which
was
hung
with
black
.
 
<EOS>
He
looked
at
the
two
executioners
,
who
were
dressed
in
black
and
masked
;
he
looked
at
the
troops
of
soldiers
on
horseback
and
on
foot
,
and
all
looked
up
at
him
in
silence
;
he
looked
at
the
vast
array
of
spectators
,
filling
up
the
view
beyond
,
and
turning
all
their
faces
upon
him
;
he
looked
at
his
old
Palace
of
St
James
's
;
and
he
looked
at
the
block
.
 
<EOS>
He
seemed
a
little
troubled
to
find
that
it
was
so
low
,
and
asked
,
"
if
there
were
no
place
higher
?
"
 
<EOS>
Then
,
to
those
upon
the
scaffold
,
he
said
,
"
that
it
was
the
Parliament
who
had
begun
the
war
,
and
not
he
;
but
he
hoped
they
might
be
guiltless
too
,
as
ill
instruments
had
gone
between
them
.
 
<EOS>
In
one
respect
,
"
he
said
,
"
he
suffered
justly
;
and
that
was
because
he
had
permitted
an
unjust
sentence
to
be
executed
on
another
.
"
 
<EOS>
In
this
he
referred
to
the
Earl
of
Strafford
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
all
afraid
to
die
;
but
he
was
anxious
to
die
easily
.
<EOS>
When
some
one
touched
the
axe
while
he
was
speaking
,
he
broke
off
and
called
out
,
"
<EOS>
Take
heed
of
the
axe
!
<EOS>
take
heed
of
the
axe
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
also
said
to
Colonel
Hacker
,
"
Take
care
that
they
do
not
put
me
to
pain
.
"
 
<EOS>
He
told
the
executioner
,
"
I
shall
say
but
very
short
prayers
,
and
then
thrust
out
my
hands
"
---
as
the
sign
to
strike
.
  
<EOS>
He
put
his
hair
up
,
under
a
white
satin
cap
which
the
bishop
had
carried
,
and
said
,
"
I
have
a
good
cause
and
a
gracious
God
on
my
side
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
The
bishop
told
him
that
he
had
but
one
stage
more
to
travel
in
this
weary
world
,
and
that
,
though
it
was
a
turbulent
and
troublesome
stage
,
it
was
a
short
one
,
and
would
carry
him
a
great
way
---
all
the
way
from
earth
to
Heaven
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
last
word
,
as
he
gave
his
cloak
and
the
George
---
the
decoration
from
his
breast
---
to
the
bishop
,
was
,
"
Remember
!
"
 
<EOS>
He
then
kneeled
down
,
laid
his
head
on
the
block
,
spread
out
his
hands
,
and
was
instantly
killed
.
<EOS>
One
universal
groan
broke
from
the
crowd
;
and
the
soldiers
,
who
had
sat
on
their
horses
and
stood
in
their
ranks
immovable
as
statues
,
were
of
a
sudden
all
in
motion
,
clearing
the
streets
.
  
<EOS>
Thus
,
in
the
forty
-
ninth
year
of
his
age
,
falling
at
the
same
time
of
his
career
as
Strafford
had
fallen
in
his
,
perished
Charles
the
First
.
 
<EOS>
With
all
my
sorrow
for
him
,
I
can
not
agree
with
him
that
he
died
"
the
martyr
of
the
people
;
"
for
the
people
had
been
martyrs
to
him
,
and
to
his
ideas
of
a
King
's
rights
,
long
before
.
 
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
am
afraid
that
he
was
but
a
bad
judge
of
martyrs
;
for
he
had
called
that
infamous
Duke
of
Buckingham
"
the
Martyr
of
his
Sovereign
.
"
    
<EOS>
England
under
Oliver
Cromwell
    
<EOS>
BEFORE
sunset
on
the
memorable
day
on
which
King
Charles
the
First
was
executed
,
the
House
of
Commons
passed
an
act
declaring
it
treason
in
any
one
to
proclaim
the
Prince
of
Wales
---
or
anybody
else
---
King
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
it
declared
that
the
House
of
Lords
was
useless
and
dangerous
,
and
ought
to
be
abolished
;
and
directed
that
the
late
King
's
statue
should
be
taken
down
from
the
Royal
Exchange
in
the
City
and
other
public
places
.
<EOS>
Having
laid
hold
of
some
famous
Royalists
who
had
escaped
from
prison
,
and
having
beheaded
the
DUKE
OF
HAMILTON
,
LORD
HOLLAND
,
and
LORD
CAPEL
,
in
Palace
Yard
(
all
of
whom
died
very
courageously
)
,
they
then
appointed
a
Council
of
State
to
govern
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
It
consisted
of
forty
-
one
members
,
of
whom
five
were
peers
.
 
<EOS>
Bradshaw
was
made
president
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
also
re
-
admitted
members
who
had
opposed
the
King
's
death
,
and
made
up
its
numbers
to
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
it
still
had
an
army
of
more
than
forty
thousand
men
to
deal
with
,
and
a
very
hard
task
it
was
to
manage
them
.
 
<EOS>
Before
the
King
's
execution
,
the
army
had
appointed
some
of
its
officers
to
remonstrate
between
them
and
the
Parliament
;
and
now
the
common
soldiers
began
to
take
that
office
upon
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
regiments
under
orders
for
Ireland
mutinied
;
one
troop
of
horse
in
the
city
of
London
seized
their
own
flag
,
and
refused
to
obey
orders
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
,
the
ringleader
was
shot
:
 
<EOS>
which
did
not
mend
the
matter
,
for
,
both
his
comrades
and
the
people
made
a
public
funeral
for
him
,
and
accompanied
the
body
to
the
grave
with
sound
of
trumpets
and
with
a
gloomy
procession
of
persons
carrying
bundles
of
rosemary
steeped
in
blood
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
was
the
only
man
to
deal
with
such
difficulties
as
these
,
and
he
soon
cut
them
short
by
bursting
at
midnight
into
the
town
of
Burford
,
near
Salisbury
,
where
the
mutineers
were
sheltered
,
taking
four
hundred
of
them
prisoners
,
and
shooting
a
number
of
them
by
sentence
of
court
-
martial
.
 
<EOS>
The
soldiers
soon
found
,
as
all
men
did
,
that
Oliver
was
not
a
man
to
be
trifled
with
.
 
<EOS>
And
there
was
an
end
of
the
mutiny
.
  
<EOS>
The
Scottish
Parliament
did
not
know
Oliver
yet
;
so
,
on
hearing
of
the
King
's
execution
,
it
proclaimed
the
Prince
of
Wales
King
Charles
the
Second
,
on
condition
of
his
respecting
the
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
.
 
<EOS>
Charles
was
abroad
at
that
time
,
and
so
was
Montrose
,
from
whose
help
he
had
hopes
enough
to
keep
him
holding
on
and
off
with
commissioners
from
Scotland
,
just
as
his
father
might
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
These
hopes
were
soon
at
an
end
;
for
,
Montrose
,
having
raised
a
few
hundred
exiles
in
Germany
,
and
landed
with
them
in
Scotland
,
found
that
the
people
there
,
instead
of
joining
him
,
deserted
the
country
at
his
approach
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
soon
taken
prisoner
and
carried
to
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
There
he
was
received
with
every
possible
insult
,
and
carried
to
prison
in
a
cart
,
his
officers
going
two
and
two
before
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sentenced
by
the
Parliament
to
be
hanged
on
a
gallows
thirty
feet
high
,
to
have
his
head
set
on
a
spike
in
Edinburgh
,
and
his
limbs
distributed
in
other
places
,
according
to
the
old
barbarous
manner
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
he
had
always
acted
under
the
Royal
orders
,
and
only
wished
he
had
limbs
enough
to
be
distributed
through
Christendom
,
that
it
might
be
the
more
widely
known
how
loyal
he
had
been
.
 
<EOS>
He
went
to
the
scaffold
in
a
bright
and
brilliant
dress
,
and
made
a
bold
end
at
thirty
-
eight
years
of
age
.
 
<EOS>
The
breath
was
scarcely
out
of
his
body
when
Charles
abandoned
his
memory
,
and
denied
that
he
had
ever
given
him
orders
to
rise
in
his
behalf
.
 
<EOS>
O
the
family
failing
was
strong
in
that
Charles
then
!
  
<EOS>
Oliver
had
been
appointed
by
the
Parliament
to
command
the
army
in
Ireland
,
where
he
took
a
terrible
vengeance
for
the
sanguinary
rebellion
,
and
made
tremendous
havoc
,
particularly
in
the
siege
of
Drogheda
,
where
no
quarter
was
given
,
and
where
he
found
at
least
a
thousand
of
the
inhabitants
shut
up
together
in
the
great
church
:
every
one
of
whom
was
killed
by
his
soldiers
,
usually
known
as
OLIVER
'S
IRONSIDES
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
numbers
of
friars
and
priests
among
them
,
and
Oliver
gruffly
wrote
home
in
his
despatch
that
these
were
"
knocked
on
the
head
"
like
the
rest
.
  
<EOS>
But
,
Charles
having
got
over
to
Scotland
where
the
men
of
the
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
led
him
a
prodigiously
dull
life
and
made
him
very
weary
with
long
sermons
and
grim
Sundays
,
the
Parliament
called
the
redoubtable
Oliver
home
to
knock
the
Scottish
men
on
the
head
for
setting
up
that
Prince
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
left
his
son
-
in
-
law
,
Ireton
,
as
general
in
Ireland
in
his
stead
(
he
died
there
afterwards
)
,
and
he
imitated
the
example
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
with
such
good
will
that
he
brought
the
country
to
subjection
,
and
laid
it
at
the
feet
of
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
end
,
they
passed
an
act
for
the
settlement
of
Ireland
,
generally
pardoning
all
the
common
people
,
but
exempting
from
this
grace
such
of
the
wealthier
sort
as
had
been
concerned
in
the
rebellion
,
or
in
any
killing
of
Protestants
,
or
who
refused
to
lay
down
their
arms
.
 
<EOS>
Great
numbers
of
Irish
were
got
out
of
the
country
to
serve
under
Catholic
powers
abroad
,
and
a
quantity
of
land
was
declared
to
have
been
forfeited
by
past
offences
,
and
was
given
to
people
who
had
lent
money
to
the
Parliament
early
in
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
These
were
sweeping
measures
;
but
,
if
Oliver
Cromwell
had
had
his
own
way
fully
,
and
had
stayed
in
Ireland
,
he
would
have
done
more
yet
.
  
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
have
said
,
the
Parliament
wanted
Oliver
for
Scotland
;
so
,
home
Oliver
came
,
and
was
made
Commander
of
all
the
Forces
of
the
Commonwealth
of
England
,
and
in
three
days
away
he
went
with
sixteen
thousand
soldiers
to
fight
the
Scottish
men
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
Scottish
men
,
being
then
---
as
you
will
generally
find
them
now
---
mighty
cautious
,
reflected
that
the
troops
they
had
were
not
used
to
war
like
the
Ironsides
,
and
would
be
beaten
in
an
open
fight
.
<EOS>
Therefore
they
said
,
"
If
we
live
quiet
in
our
trenches
in
Edinburgh
here
,
and
if
all
the
farmers
come
into
the
town
and
desert
the
country
,
the
Ironsides
will
be
driven
out
by
iron
hunger
and
be
forced
to
go
away
.
"
 
<EOS>
This
was
,
no
doubt
,
the
wisest
plan
;
but
as
the
Scottish
clergy
WOULD
interfere
with
what
they
knew
nothing
about
,
and
would
perpetually
preach
long
sermons
exhorting
the
soldiers
to
come
out
and
fight
,
the
soldiers
got
it
in
their
heads
that
they
absolutely
must
come
out
and
fight
.
 
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
in
an
evil
hour
for
themselves
,
they
came
out
of
their
safe
position
.
<EOS>
Oliver
fell
upon
them
instantly
,
and
killed
three
thousand
,
and
took
ten
thousand
prisoners
.
  
<EOS>
To
gratify
the
Scottish
Parliament
,
and
preserve
their
favour
,
Charles
had
signed
a
declaration
they
laid
before
him
,
reproaching
the
memory
of
his
father
and
mother
,
and
representing
himself
as
a
most
religious
Prince
,
to
whom
the
Solemn
League
and
Covenant
was
as
dear
as
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
meant
no
sort
of
truth
in
this
,
and
soon
afterwards
galloped
away
on
horseback
to
join
some
tiresome
Highland
friends
,
who
were
always
flourishing
dirks
and
broadswords
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
overtaken
and
induced
to
return
;
but
this
attempt
,
which
was
called
"
The
Start
,
"
did
him
just
so
much
service
,
that
they
did
not
preach
quite
such
long
sermons
at
him
afterwards
as
they
had
done
before
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
first
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
one
,
the
Scottish
people
crowned
him
at
Scone
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
took
the
chief
command
of
an
army
of
twenty
thousand
men
,
and
marched
to
Stirling
.
 
<EOS>
His
hopes
were
heightened
,
I
dare
say
,
by
the
redoubtable
Oliver
being
ill
of
an
ague
;
but
Oliver
scrambled
out
of
bed
in
no
time
,
and
went
to
work
with
such
energy
that
he
got
behind
the
Royalist
army
and
cut
it
off
from
all
communication
with
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
for
it
then
,
but
to
go
on
to
England
;
so
it
went
on
as
far
as
Worcester
,
where
the
mayor
and
some
of
the
gentry
proclaimed
King
Charles
the
Second
straightway
.
 
<EOS>
His
proclamation
,
however
,
was
of
little
use
to
him
,
for
very
few
Royalists
appeared
;
and
,
on
the
very
same
day
,
two
people
were
publicly
beheaded
on
Tower
Hill
for
espousing
his
cause
.
 
<EOS>
Up
came
Oliver
to
Worcester
too
,
at
double
quick
speed
,
and
he
and
his
Ironsides
so
laid
about
them
in
the
great
battle
which
was
fought
there
,
that
they
completely
beat
the
Scottish
men
,
and
destroyed
the
Royalist
army
;
though
the
Scottish
men
fought
so
gallantly
that
it
took
five
hours
to
do
.
  
<EOS>
The
escape
of
Charles
after
this
battle
of
Worcester
did
him
good
service
long
afterwards
,
for
it
induced
many
of
the
generous
English
people
to
take
a
romantic
interest
in
him
,
and
to
think
much
better
of
him
than
he
ever
deserved
.
 
<EOS>
He
fled
in
the
night
,
with
not
more
than
sixty
followers
,
to
the
house
of
a
Catholic
lady
in
Staffordshire
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
for
his
greater
safety
,
the
whole
sixty
left
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
cropped
his
hair
,
stained
his
face
and
hands
brown
as
if
they
were
sunburnt
,
put
on
the
clothes
of
a
labouring
countryman
,
and
went
out
in
the
morning
with
his
axe
in
his
hand
,
accompanied
by
four
wood
-
cutters
who
were
brothers
,
and
another
man
who
was
their
brother
-
in
-
law
.
 
<EOS>
These
good
fellows
made
a
bed
for
him
under
a
tree
,
as
the
weather
was
very
bad
;
and
the
wife
of
one
of
them
brought
him
food
to
eat
;
and
the
old
mother
of
the
four
brothers
came
and
fell
down
on
her
knees
before
him
in
the
wood
,
and
thanked
God
that
her
sons
were
engaged
in
saving
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
At
night
,
he
came
out
of
the
forest
and
went
on
to
another
house
which
was
near
the
river
Severn
,
with
the
intention
of
passing
into
Wales
;
but
the
place
swarmed
with
soldiers
,
and
the
bridges
were
guarded
,
and
all
the
boats
were
made
fast
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
after
lying
in
a
hayloft
covered
over
with
hay
,
for
some
time
,
he
came
out
of
his
place
,
attended
by
COLONEL
CARELESS
,
a
Catholic
gentleman
who
had
met
him
there
,
and
with
whom
he
lay
hid
,
all
next
day
,
up
in
the
shady
branches
of
a
fine
old
oak
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
lucky
for
the
King
that
it
was
September
-
time
,
and
that
the
leaves
had
not
begun
to
fall
,
since
he
and
the
Colonel
,
perched
up
in
this
tree
,
could
catch
glimpses
of
the
soldiers
riding
about
below
,
and
could
hear
the
crash
in
the
wood
as
they
went
about
beating
the
boughs
.
  
<EOS>
After
this
,
he
walked
and
walked
until
his
feet
were
all
blistered
;
and
,
having
been
concealed
all
one
day
in
a
house
which
was
searched
by
the
troopers
while
he
was
there
,
went
with
LORD
WILMOT
,
another
of
his
good
friends
,
to
a
place
called
Bentley
,
where
one
MISS
LANE
,
a
Protestant
lady
,
had
obtained
a
pass
to
be
allowed
to
ride
through
the
guards
to
see
a
relation
of
hers
near
Bristol
.
<EOS>
Disguised
as
a
servant
,
he
rode
in
the
saddle
before
this
young
lady
to
the
house
of
SIR
JOHN
WINTER
,
while
Lord
Wilmot
rode
there
boldly
,
like
a
plain
country
gentleman
,
with
dogs
at
his
heels
.
 
<EOS>
It
happened
that
Sir
John
Winter
's
butler
had
been
servant
in
Richmond
Palace
,
and
knew
Charles
the
moment
he
set
eyes
upon
him
;
but
,
the
butler
was
faithful
and
kept
the
secret
.
 
<EOS>
As
no
ship
could
be
found
to
carry
him
abroad
,
it
was
planned
that
he
should
go
---
still
travelling
with
Miss
Lane
as
her
servant
---
to
another
house
,
at
Trent
near
Sherborne
in
Dorsetshire
;
and
then
Miss
Lane
and
her
cousin
,
MR
.
<EOS>
LASCELLES
,
who
had
gone
on
horseback
beside
her
all
the
way
,
went
home
.
 
<EOS>
I
hope
Miss
Lane
was
going
to
marry
that
cousin
,
for
I
am
sure
she
must
have
been
a
brave
,
kind
girl
.
 
<EOS>
If
I
had
been
that
cousin
,
I
should
certainly
have
loved
Miss
Lane
.
  
<EOS>
When
Charles
,
lonely
for
the
loss
of
Miss
Lane
,
was
safe
at
Trent
,
a
ship
was
hired
at
Lyme
,
the
master
of
which
engaged
to
take
two
gentlemen
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
evening
of
the
same
day
,
the
King
---
now
riding
as
servant
before
another
young
lady
---
set
off
for
a
public
-
house
at
a
place
called
Charmouth
,
where
the
captain
of
the
vessel
was
to
take
him
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
captain
's
wife
,
being
afraid
of
her
husband
getting
into
trouble
,
locked
him
up
and
would
not
let
him
sail
.
 
<EOS>
Then
they
went
away
to
Bridport
;
and
,
coming
to
the
inn
there
,
found
the
stable
-
yard
full
of
soldiers
who
were
on
the
look
-
out
for
Charles
,
and
who
talked
about
him
while
they
drank
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
such
presence
of
mind
,
that
he
led
the
horses
of
his
party
through
the
yard
as
any
other
servant
might
have
done
,
and
said
,
"
Come
out
of
the
way
,
you
soldiers
<EOS>
;
let
us
have
room
to
pass
here
!
"
 
<EOS>
As
he
went
along
,
he
met
a
half
-
tipsy
ostler
,
who
rubbed
his
eyes
and
said
to
him
,
"
Why
,
I
was
formerly
servant
to
Mr
Potter
at
Exeter
,
and
surely
I
have
sometimes
seen
you
there
,
young
man
?
"
 
<EOS>
He
certainly
had
,
for
Charles
had
lodged
there
.
 
<EOS>
His
ready
answer
was
,
"
Ah
,
I
did
live
with
him
once
;
but
I
have
no
time
to
talk
now
.
 
<EOS>
We
'll
have
a
pot
of
beer
together
when
I
come
back
.
"
  
<EOS>
From
this
dangerous
place
he
returned
to
Trent
,
and
lay
there
concealed
several
days
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
escaped
to
Heale
,
near
Salisbury
;
where
,
in
the
house
of
a
widow
lady
,
he
was
hidden
five
days
,
until
the
master
of
a
collier
lying
off
Shoreham
in
Sussex
,
undertook
to
convey
a
"
gentleman
"
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
the
fifteenth
of
October
,
accompanied
by
two
colonels
and
a
merchant
,
the
King
rode
to
Brighton
,
<EOS>
then
a
little
fishing
village
,
to
give
the
captain
of
the
ship
a
supper
before
going
on
board
;
but
,
so
many
people
knew
him
,
that
this
captain
knew
him
too
,
and
not
only
he
,
but
the
landlord
and
landlady
also
.
 
<EOS>
Before
he
went
away
,
the
landlord
came
behind
his
chair
,
kissed
his
hand
,
and
said
he
hoped
to
live
to
be
a
lord
and
to
see
his
wife
a
lady
;
at
which
Charles
laughed
.
 
<EOS>
They
had
had
a
good
supper
by
this
time
,
and
plenty
of
smoking
and
drinking
,
at
which
the
King
was
a
first
-
rate
hand
;
so
,
the
captain
assured
him
that
he
would
stand
by
him
,
and
he
did
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
the
captain
should
pretend
to
sail
to
Deal
,
and
that
Charles
should
address
the
sailors
and
say
he
was
a
gentleman
in
debt
who
was
running
away
from
his
creditors
,
and
that
he
hoped
they
would
join
him
in
persuading
the
captain
to
put
him
ashore
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
King
acted
his
part
very
well
indeed
,
and
gave
the
sailors
twenty
shillings
to
drink
,
they
begged
the
captain
to
do
what
such
a
worthy
gentleman
asked
.
 
<EOS>
He
pretended
to
yield
to
their
entreaties
,
and
the
King
got
safe
to
Normandy
.
  
<EOS>
Ireland
being
now
subdued
,
and
Scotland
kept
quiet
by
plenty
of
forts
and
soldiers
put
there
by
Oliver
,
the
Parliament
would
have
gone
on
quietly
enough
,
as
far
as
fighting
with
any
foreign
enemy
went
,
but
for
getting
into
trouble
with
the
Dutch
,
who
in
the
spring
of
the
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
one
sent
a
fleet
into
the
Downs
under
their
ADMIRAL
VAN
TROMP
,
to
call
upon
the
bold
English
ADMIRAL
BLAKE
(
who
was
there
with
half
as
many
ships
as
the
Dutch
)
to
strike
his
flag
.
 
<EOS>
Blake
fired
a
raging
broadside
instead
,
and
beat
off
Van
Tromp
;
who
,
in
the
autumn
,
came
back
again
with
seventy
ships
,
and
challenged
the
bold
Blake
---
who
still
was
only
half
as
strong
---
to
fight
him
.
 
<EOS>
Blake
fought
him
all
day
;
but
,
finding
that
the
Dutch
were
too
many
for
him
,
got
quietly
off
at
night
.
 
<EOS>
What
does
Van
Tromp
upon
this
,
but
goes
cruising
and
boasting
about
the
Channel
,
between
the
North
Foreland
and
the
Isle
of
Wight
,
with
a
great
Dutch
broom
tied
to
his
masthead
,
as
a
sign
that
he
could
and
would
sweep
the
English
of
the
sea
!
 
<EOS>
Within
three
months
,
Blake
lowered
his
tone
though
,
and
his
broom
too
;
for
,
he
and
two
other
bold
commanders
,
DEAN
and
MONK
,
fought
him
three
whole
days
,
took
twenty
-
three
of
his
ships
,
shivered
his
broom
to
pieces
,
and
settled
his
business
.
  
<EOS>
Things
were
no
sooner
quiet
again
,
than
the
army
began
to
complain
to
the
Parliament
that
they
were
not
governing
the
nation
properly
,
and
to
hint
that
they
thought
they
could
do
it
better
themselves
.
<EOS>
Oliver
,
who
had
now
made
up
his
mind
to
be
the
head
of
the
state
,
or
nothing
at
all
,
supported
them
in
this
,
and
called
a
meeting
of
officers
and
his
own
Parliamentary
friends
,
at
his
lodgings
in
Whitehall
,
to
consider
the
best
way
of
getting
rid
of
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
It
had
now
lasted
just
as
many
years
as
the
King
's
unbridled
power
had
lasted
,
before
it
came
into
existence
.
 
<EOS>
The
end
of
the
deliberation
was
,
that
Oliver
went
down
to
the
House
in
his
usual
plain
black
dress
,
with
his
usual
grey
worsted
stockings
,
but
with
an
unusual
party
of
soldiers
behind
him
.
 
<EOS>
These
last
he
left
in
the
lobby
,
and
then
went
in
and
sat
down
.
 
<EOS>
Presently
he
got
up
,
made
the
Parliament
a
speech
,
told
them
that
the
Lord
had
done
with
them
,
stamped
his
foot
and
said
,
"
You
are
no
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
Bring
them
in
!
 
<EOS>
Bring
them
in
!
"
 
<EOS>
At
this
signal
the
door
flew
open
,
and
the
soldiers
appeared
.
 
<EOS>
"
This
is
not
honest
,
"
said
Sir
Harry
Vane
,
one
of
the
members
.
 
<EOS>
"
Sir
Harry
Vane
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Cromwell
;
"
O
,
Sir
Harry
Vane
!
 
<EOS>
The
Lord
deliver
me
from
Sir
Harry
Vane
!
"
 
<EOS>
Then
he
pointed
out
members
one
by
one
,
and
said
this
man
was
a
drunkard
,
and
that
man
a
dissipated
fellow
,
and
that
man
a
liar
,
and
so
on
.
<EOS>
Then
he
caused
the
Speaker
to
be
walked
out
of
his
chair
,
told
the
guard
to
clear
the
House
,
called
the
mace
upon
the
table
---
which
is
a
sign
that
the
House
is
sitting
---
"
a
fool
's
bauble
,
"
and
said
,
"
here
,
carry
it
away
!
"
 
<EOS>
Being
obeyed
in
all
these
orders
,
he
quietly
locked
the
door
,
put
the
key
in
his
pocket
,
walked
back
to
Whitehall
again
,
and
told
his
friends
,
who
were
still
assembled
there
,
what
he
had
done
.
  
<EOS>
They
formed
a
new
Council
of
State
after
this
extraordinary
proceeding
,
and
got
a
new
Parliament
together
in
their
own
way
:
which
Oliver
himself
opened
in
a
sort
of
sermon
,
and
which
he
said
was
the
beginning
of
a
perfect
heaven
upon
earth
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
Parliament
there
sat
a
well
-
known
leather
-
seller
,
who
had
taken
the
singular
name
of
Praise
God
Barebones
,
and
from
whom
it
was
called
,
for
a
joke
,
Barebones
's
Parliament
,
though
its
general
name
was
the
Little
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
As
it
soon
appeared
that
it
was
not
going
to
put
Oliver
in
the
first
place
,
it
turned
out
to
be
not
at
all
like
the
beginning
of
heaven
upon
earth
,
and
Oliver
said
it
really
was
not
to
be
borne
with
.
 
<EOS>
So
he
cleared
off
that
Parliament
in
much
the
same
way
as
he
had
disposed
of
the
other
;
and
then
the
council
of
officers
decided
that
he
must
be
made
the
supreme
authority
of
the
kingdom
,
under
the
title
of
the
Lord
Protector
of
the
Commonwealth
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
on
the
sixteenth
of
December
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
three
,
a
great
procession
was
formed
at
Oliver
's
door
,
and
he
came
out
in
a
black
velvet
suit
and
a
big
pair
of
boots
,
and
got
into
his
coach
and
went
down
to
Westminster
,
attended
by
the
judges
,
and
the
lord
mayor
,
and
the
aldermen
,
and
all
the
other
great
and
wonderful
personages
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
in
the
Court
of
Chancery
,
he
publicly
accepted
the
office
of
Lord
Protector
.
<EOS>
Then
he
was
sworn
,
and
the
City
sword
was
handed
to
him
,
and
the
seal
was
handed
to
him
,
and
all
the
other
things
were
handed
to
him
which
are
usually
handed
to
Kings
and
Queens
on
state
occasions
.
<EOS>
When
Oliver
had
handed
them
all
back
,
he
was
quite
made
and
completely
finished
off
as
Lord
Protector
;
and
several
of
the
Ironsides
preached
about
it
at
great
length
,
all
the
evening
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
OLIVER
CROMWELL
---
whom
the
people
long
called
OLD
NOLL
---
in
accepting
the
office
of
Protector
,
had
bound
himself
by
a
certain
paper
which
was
handed
to
him
,
called
"
the
Instrument
,
"
to
summon
a
Parliament
,
consisting
of
between
four
and
five
hundred
members
,
in
the
election
of
which
neither
the
Royalists
nor
the
Catholics
were
to
have
any
share
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
also
pledged
himself
that
this
Parliament
should
not
be
dissolved
without
its
own
consent
until
it
had
sat
five
months
.
  
<EOS>
When
this
Parliament
met
,
Oliver
made
a
speech
to
them
of
three
hours
long
,
very
wisely
advising
them
what
to
do
for
the
credit
and
happiness
of
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
To
keep
down
the
more
violent
members
,
he
required
them
to
sign
a
recognition
of
what
they
were
forbidden
by
"
the
Instrument
"
to
do
;
which
was
,
chiefly
,
to
take
the
power
from
one
single
person
at
the
head
of
the
state
or
to
command
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
dismissed
them
to
go
to
work
.
 
<EOS>
With
his
usual
vigour
and
resolution
he
went
to
work
himself
with
some
frantic
preachers
---
who
were
rather
overdoing
their
sermons
in
calling
him
a
villain
and
a
tyrant
---
by
shutting
up
their
chapels
,
and
sending
a
few
of
them
off
to
prison
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
not
at
that
time
,
in
England
or
anywhere
else
,
a
man
so
able
to
govern
the
country
as
Oliver
Cromwell
.
 
<EOS>
Although
he
ruled
with
a
strong
hand
,
and
levied
a
very
heavy
tax
on
the
Royalists
(
but
not
until
they
had
plotted
against
his
life
)
,
he
ruled
wisely
,
and
as
the
times
required
.
 
<EOS>
He
caused
England
to
be
so
respected
abroad
,
that
I
wish
some
lords
and
gentlemen
who
have
governed
it
under
kings
and
queens
in
later
days
would
have
taken
a
leaf
out
of
Oliver
Cromwell
's
book
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
bold
Admiral
Blake
to
the
Mediterranean
Sea
,
to
make
the
Duke
of
Tuscany
pay
sixty
thousand
pounds
for
injuries
he
had
done
to
British
subjects
,
and
spoliation
he
had
committed
on
English
merchants
.
 
<EOS>
He
further
despatched
him
and
his
fleet
to
Algiers
,
Tunis
,
and
Tripoli
,
to
have
every
English
ship
and
every
English
man
delivered
up
to
him
that
had
been
taken
by
pirates
in
those
parts
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
was
gloriously
done
;
and
it
began
to
be
thoroughly
well
known
,
all
over
the
world
,
that
England
was
governed
by
a
man
in
earnest
,
who
would
not
allow
the
English
name
to
be
insulted
or
slighted
anywhere
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
not
all
his
foreign
triumphs
.
 
<EOS>
He
sent
a
fleet
to
sea
against
the
Dutch
;
and
the
two
powers
,
each
with
one
hundred
ships
upon
its
side
,
met
in
the
English
Channel
off
the
North
Foreland
,
where
the
fight
lasted
all
day
long
.
 
<EOS>
Dean
was
killed
in
this
fight
;
but
Monk
,
who
commanded
in
the
same
ship
with
him
,
threw
his
cloak
over
his
body
,
that
the
sailors
might
not
know
of
his
death
,
and
be
disheartened
.
 
<EOS>
Nor
were
they
.
 
<EOS>
The
English
broadsides
so
exceedingly
astonished
the
Dutch
that
they
sheered
off
at
last
,
though
the
redoubtable
Van
Tromp
fired
upon
them
with
his
own
guns
for
deserting
their
flag
.
 
<EOS>
Soon
afterwards
,
the
two
fleets
engaged
again
,
off
the
coast
of
Holland
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
the
valiant
Van
Tromp
was
shot
through
the
heart
,
and
the
Dutch
gave
in
,
and
peace
was
made
.
  
<EOS>
Further
than
this
,
Oliver
resolved
not
to
bear
the
domineering
and
bigoted
conduct
of
Spain
,
which
country
not
only
claimed
a
right
to
all
the
gold
and
silver
that
could
be
found
in
South
America
,
and
treated
the
ships
of
all
other
countries
who
visited
those
regions
,
as
pirates
,
but
put
English
subjects
into
the
horrible
Spanish
prisons
of
the
Inquisition
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
Oliver
told
the
Spanish
ambassador
that
English
ships
must
be
free
to
go
wherever
they
would
,
and
that
English
merchants
must
not
be
thrown
into
those
same
dungeons
,
no
,
not
for
the
pleasure
of
all
the
priests
in
Spain
.
 
<EOS>
To
this
,
the
Spanish
ambassador
replied
that
the
gold
and
silver
country
,
and
the
Holy
Inquisition
,
were
his
King
's
two
eyes
,
neither
of
which
he
could
submit
to
have
put
out
.
 
<EOS>
Very
well
,
said
Oliver
,
then
he
was
afraid
he
(
Oliver
)
must
damage
those
two
eyes
directly
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
another
fleet
was
despatched
under
two
commanders
,
PENN
and
VENABLES
,
for
Hispaniola
;
where
,
however
,
the
Spaniards
got
the
better
of
the
fight
.
 
<EOS>
Consequently
,
the
fleet
came
home
again
,
after
taking
Jamaica
on
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
,
indignant
with
the
two
commanders
who
had
not
done
what
bold
Admiral
Blake
would
have
done
,
clapped
them
both
into
prison
,
declared
war
against
Spain
,
and
made
a
treaty
with
France
,
in
virtue
of
which
it
was
to
shelter
the
King
and
his
brother
the
Duke
of
York
no
longer
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
he
sent
a
fleet
abroad
under
bold
Admiral
Blake
,
which
brought
the
King
of
Portugal
to
his
senses
---
just
to
keep
its
hand
in
---
and
then
engaged
a
Spanish
fleet
,
sunk
four
great
ships
,
and
took
two
more
,
laden
with
silver
to
the
value
of
two
millions
of
pounds
:
 
which
dazzling
prize
was
brought
from
Portsmouth
to
London
in
waggons
,
with
the
populace
of
all
the
towns
and
villages
through
which
the
waggons
passed
,
shouting
with
all
their
might
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
victory
,
bold
Admiral
Blake
sailed
away
to
the
port
of
Santa
Cruz
to
cut
off
the
Spanish
treasure
-
ships
coming
from
Mexico
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
found
them
,
ten
in
number
,
with
seven
others
to
take
care
of
them
,
and
a
big
castle
,
and
seven
batteries
,
all
roaring
and
blazing
away
at
him
with
great
guns
.
 
<EOS>
Blake
cared
no
more
for
great
guns
than
for
pop
-
guns
---
no
more
for
their
hot
iron
balls
than
for
snow
-
balls
.
<EOS>
He
dashed
into
the
harbour
,
captured
and
burnt
every
one
of
the
ships
,
and
came
sailing
out
again
triumphantly
,
with
the
victorious
English
flag
flying
at
his
masthead
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
the
last
triumph
of
this
great
commander
,
who
had
sailed
and
fought
until
he
was
quite
worn
out
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
,
as
his
successful
ship
was
coming
into
Plymouth
Harbour
amidst
the
joyful
acclamations
of
the
people
,
and
was
buried
in
state
in
Westminster
Abbey
.
 
<EOS>
Not
to
lie
there
,
long
.
  
<EOS>
Over
and
above
all
this
,
Oliver
found
that
the
VAUDOIS
,
or
Protestant
people
of
the
valleys
of
Lucerne
,
were
insolently
treated
by
the
Catholic
powers
,
and
were
even
put
to
death
for
their
religion
,
in
an
audacious
and
bloody
manner
.
 
<EOS>
Instantly
,
he
informed
those
powers
that
this
was
a
thing
which
Protestant
England
would
not
allow
;
and
he
speedily
carried
his
point
,
through
the
might
of
his
great
name
,
and
established
their
right
to
worship
God
in
peace
after
their
own
harmless
manner
.
  
<EOS>
Lastly
,
his
English
army
won
such
admiration
in
fighting
with
the
French
against
the
Spaniards
,
that
,
after
they
had
assaulted
the
town
of
Dunkirk
together
,
the
French
King
in
person
gave
it
up
to
the
English
,
that
it
might
be
a
token
to
them
of
their
might
and
valour
.
  
<EOS>
There
were
plots
enough
against
Oliver
among
the
frantic
religionists
(
who
called
themselves
Fifth
Monarchy
Men
)
,
and
among
the
disappointed
Republicans
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
difficult
game
to
play
,
for
the
Royalists
were
always
ready
to
side
with
either
party
against
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
"
King
over
the
water
,
"
too
,
as
Charles
was
called
,
had
no
scruples
about
plotting
with
any
one
against
his
life
;
although
there
is
reason
to
suppose
that
he
would
willingly
have
married
one
of
his
daughters
,
if
Oliver
would
have
had
such
a
son
-
in
-
law
.
<EOS>
There
was
a
certain
COLONEL
SAXBY
of
the
army
,
once
a
great
supporter
of
Oliver
's
but
now
turned
against
him
,
who
was
a
grievous
trouble
to
him
through
all
this
part
of
his
career
;
and
who
came
and
went
between
the
discontented
in
England
and
Spain
,
and
Charles
who
put
himself
in
alliance
with
Spain
on
being
thrown
off
by
France
.
 
<EOS>
This
man
died
in
prison
at
last
;
but
not
until
there
had
been
very
serious
plots
between
the
Royalists
and
Republicans
,
and
an
actual
rising
of
them
in
England
,
when
they
burst
into
the
city
of
Salisbury
,
on
a
Sunday
night
,
seized
the
judges
who
were
going
to
hold
the
assizes
there
next
day
,
and
would
have
hanged
them
but
for
the
merciful
objections
of
the
more
temperate
of
their
number
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
was
so
vigorous
and
shrewd
that
he
soon
put
this
revolt
down
,
as
he
did
most
other
conspiracies
;
and
it
was
well
for
one
of
its
chief
managers
---
<EOS>
that
same
Lord
Wilmot
who
had
assisted
in
Charles
's
flight
,
and
was
now
EARL
OF
ROCHESTER
---
that
he
made
his
escape
.
 
<EOS>
Oliver
seemed
to
have
eyes
and
ears
everywhere
,
and
secured
such
sources
of
information
as
his
enemies
little
dreamed
of
.
 
<EOS>
There
was
a
chosen
body
of
six
persons
,
called
the
Sealed
Knot
,
who
were
in
the
closest
and
most
secret
confidence
of
Charles
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
the
foremost
of
these
very
men
,
a
SIR
RICHARD
WILLIS
,
reported
to
Oliver
everything
that
passed
among
them
,
and
had
two
hundred
a
year
for
it
.
  
<EOS>
MILES
SYNDARCOMB
,
also
of
the
old
army
,
was
another
conspirator
against
the
Protector
.
 
<EOS>
He
and
a
man
named
CECIL
,
bribed
one
of
his
Life
Guards
to
let
them
have
good
notice
when
he
was
going
out
---
intending
to
shoot
him
from
a
window
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
owing
either
to
his
caution
or
his
good
fortune
,
they
could
never
get
an
aim
at
him
.
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
this
design
,
they
got
into
the
chapel
in
Whitehall
,
with
a
basketful
of
combustibles
,
which
were
to
explode
by
means
of
a
slow
match
in
six
hours
;
then
,
in
the
noise
and
confusion
of
the
fire
,
they
hoped
to
kill
Oliver
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
Life
Guardsman
himself
disclosed
this
plot
;
and
they
were
seized
,
and
Miles
died
(
or
killed
himself
in
prison
)
a
little
while
before
he
was
ordered
for
execution
.
 
<EOS>
A
few
such
plotters
Oliver
caused
to
be
beheaded
,
a
few
more
to
be
hanged
,
and
many
more
,
including
those
who
rose
in
arms
against
him
,
to
be
sent
as
slaves
to
the
West
Indies
.
 
<EOS>
If
he
were
rigid
,
he
was
impartial
too
,
in
asserting
the
laws
of
England
.
<EOS>
When
a
Portuguese
nobleman
,
the
brother
of
the
Portuguese
ambassador
,
killed
a
London
citizen
in
mistake
for
another
man
with
whom
he
had
had
a
quarrel
,
Oliver
caused
him
to
be
tried
before
a
jury
of
Englishmen
and
foreigners
,
and
had
him
executed
in
spite
of
the
entreaties
of
all
the
ambassadors
in
London
.
  
<EOS>
One
of
Oliver
's
own
friends
,
the
DUKE
OF
OLDENBURGH
,
in
sending
him
a
present
of
six
fine
coach
-
horses
,
was
very
near
doing
more
to
please
the
Royalists
than
all
the
plotters
put
together
.
 
<EOS>
One
day
,
Oliver
went
with
his
coach
,
drawn
by
these
six
horses
,
into
Hyde
Park
,
to
dine
with
his
secretary
and
some
of
his
other
gentlemen
under
the
trees
there
.
 
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
being
merry
,
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
put
his
friends
inside
and
to
drive
them
home
:
 
a
postillion
riding
one
of
the
foremost
horses
,
as
the
custom
was
.
<EOS>
On
account
of
Oliver
's
being
too
free
with
the
whip
,
the
six
fine
horses
went
off
at
a
gallop
,
the
postillion
got
thrown
,
and
Oliver
fell
upon
the
coach
-
pole
and
narrowly
escaped
being
shot
by
his
own
pistol
,
which
got
entangled
with
his
clothes
in
the
harness
,
and
went
off
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
dragged
some
distance
by
the
foot
,
until
his
foot
came
out
of
the
shoe
,
and
then
he
came
safely
to
the
ground
under
the
broad
body
of
the
coach
,
and
was
very
little
the
worse
.
 
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
inside
were
only
bruised
,
and
the
discontented
people
of
all
parties
were
much
disappointed
.
  
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
history
of
the
Protectorate
of
Oliver
Cromwell
is
a
history
of
his
Parliaments
.
 
<EOS>
His
first
one
not
pleasing
him
at
all
,
he
waited
until
the
five
months
were
out
,
and
then
dissolved
it
.
<EOS>
The
next
was
better
suited
to
his
views
;
and
from
that
he
desired
to
get
---
if
he
could
with
safety
to
himself
---
the
title
of
King
.
<EOS>
He
had
had
this
in
his
mind
some
time
:
 
whether
because
he
thought
that
the
English
people
,
being
more
used
to
the
title
,
were
more
likely
to
obey
it
;
or
whether
because
he
really
wished
to
be
a
king
himself
,
and
to
leave
the
succession
to
that
title
in
his
family
,
is
far
from
clear
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
already
as
high
,
in
England
and
in
all
the
world
,
as
he
would
ever
be
,
and
I
doubt
if
he
cared
for
the
mere
name
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
a
paper
,
called
the
"
Humble
Petition
and
Advice
,
"
was
presented
to
him
by
the
House
of
Commons
,
praying
him
to
take
a
high
title
and
to
appoint
his
successor
.
 
<EOS>
That
he
would
have
taken
the
title
of
King
<EOS>
there
is
no
doubt
,
but
for
the
strong
opposition
of
the
army
.
 
<EOS>
This
induced
him
to
forbear
,
and
to
assent
only
to
the
other
points
of
the
petition
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
which
occasion
there
was
another
grand
show
in
Westminster
Hall
,
when
the
Speaker
of
the
House
of
Commons
formally
invested
him
with
a
purple
robe
lined
with
ermine
,
and
presented
him
with
a
splendidly
bound
Bible
,
and
put
a
golden
sceptre
in
his
hand
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
time
the
Parliament
met
,
he
called
a
House
of
Lords
of
sixty
members
,
as
the
petition
gave
him
power
to
do
;
but
as
that
Parliament
did
not
please
him
either
,
and
would
not
proceed
to
the
business
of
the
country
,
he
jumped
into
a
coach
one
morning
,
took
six
Guards
with
him
,
and
sent
them
to
the
right
-
about
.
 
<EOS>
I
wish
this
had
been
a
warning
to
Parliaments
to
avoid
long
speeches
,
and
do
more
work
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
the
month
of
August
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
fifty
-
eight
,
when
Oliver
Cromwell
's
favourite
daughter
,
ELIZABETH
CLAYPOLE
(
who
had
lately
lost
her
youngest
son
)
,
lay
very
ill
,
and
his
mind
was
greatly
troubled
,
because
he
loved
her
dearly
.
<EOS>
Another
of
his
daughters
was
married
to
LORD
FALCONBERG
,
another
to
the
grandson
of
the
Earl
of
Warwick
,
and
he
had
made
his
son
RICHARD
one
of
the
Members
of
the
Upper
House
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
very
kind
and
loving
to
them
all
,
being
a
good
father
and
a
good
husband
;
but
he
loved
this
daughter
the
best
of
the
family
,
and
went
down
to
Hampton
Court
to
see
her
,
and
could
hardly
be
induced
to
stir
from
her
sick
room
until
she
died
.
 
<EOS>
Although
his
religion
had
been
of
a
gloomy
kind
,
his
disposition
had
been
always
cheerful
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
been
fond
of
music
in
his
home
,
and
had
kept
open
table
once
a
week
for
all
officers
of
the
army
not
below
the
rank
of
captain
,
and
had
always
preserved
in
his
house
a
quiet
,
sensible
dignity
.
 
<EOS>
He
encouraged
men
of
genius
and
learning
,
and
loved
to
have
them
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
MILTON
was
one
of
his
great
friends
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
good
humoured
too
,
with
the
nobility
,
whose
dresses
and
manners
were
very
different
from
his
;
and
to
show
them
what
good
information
he
had
,
he
would
sometimes
jokingly
tell
them
when
they
were
his
guests
,
where
they
had
last
drunk
the
health
of
the
"
King
over
the
water
,
"
and
would
recommend
them
to
be
more
private
(
if
they
could
)
another
time
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
had
lived
in
busy
times
,
had
borne
the
weight
of
heavy
State
affairs
,
and
had
often
gone
in
fear
of
his
life
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
ill
of
the
gout
and
ague
;
and
when
the
death
of
his
beloved
child
came
upon
him
in
addition
,
he
sank
,
never
to
raise
his
head
again
.
 
<EOS>
He
told
his
physicians
on
the
twenty
-
fourth
of
August
that
the
Lord
had
assured
him
that
he
was
not
to
die
in
that
illness
,
and
that
he
would
certainly
get
better
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
only
his
sick
fancy
,
for
on
the
third
of
September
,
which
was
the
anniversary
of
the
great
battle
of
Worcester
,
and
the
day
of
the
year
which
he
called
his
fortunate
day
,
he
died
,
in
the
sixtieth
year
of
his
age
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
delirious
,
and
had
lain
insensible
some
hours
,
but
he
had
been
overheard
to
murmur
a
very
good
prayer
the
day
before
.
<EOS>
The
whole
country
lamented
his
death
.
 
<EOS>
If
you
want
to
know
the
real
worth
of
Oliver
Cromwell
,
and
his
real
services
to
his
country
,
you
can
hardly
do
better
than
compare
England
under
him
,
with
England
under
CHARLES
THE
SECOND
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
appointed
his
son
Richard
to
succeed
him
,
and
after
there
had
been
,
at
Somerset
House
in
the
Strand
,
a
lying
in
state
more
splendid
than
sensible
---
as
all
such
vanities
after
death
are
,
I
think
---
Richard
became
Lord
Protector
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
an
amiable
country
gentleman
,
but
had
none
of
his
father
's
great
genius
,
and
was
quite
unfit
for
such
a
post
in
such
a
storm
of
parties
.
 
<EOS>
Richard
's
Protectorate
,
which
only
lasted
a
year
and
a
half
,
is
a
history
of
quarrels
between
the
officers
of
the
army
and
the
Parliament
,
and
between
the
officers
among
themselves
;
and
of
a
growing
discontent
among
the
people
,
who
had
far
too
many
long
sermons
and
far
too
few
amusements
,
and
wanted
a
change
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
General
Monk
got
the
army
well
into
his
own
hands
,
and
then
in
pursuance
of
a
secret
plan
he
seems
to
have
entertained
from
the
time
of
Oliver
's
death
,
declared
for
the
King
's
cause
.
 
<EOS>
He
did
not
do
this
openly
;
but
,
in
his
place
in
the
House
of
Commons
,
as
one
of
the
members
for
Devonshire
,
strongly
advocated
the
proposals
of
one
SIR
JOHN
GREENVILLE
,
who
came
to
the
House
with
a
letter
from
Charles
,
dated
from
Breda
,
and
with
whom
he
had
previously
been
in
secret
communication
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
plots
and
counterplots
,
and
a
recall
of
the
last
members
of
the
Long
Parliament
,
and
an
end
of
the
Long
Parliament
,
and
risings
of
the
Royalists
that
were
made
too
soon
;
and
most
men
being
tired
out
,
and
there
being
no
one
to
head
the
country
<EOS>
now
great
Oliver
was
dead
,
it
was
readily
agreed
to
welcome
Charles
Stuart
.
 
<EOS>
Some
of
the
wiser
and
better
members
said
---
what
was
most
true
---
that
in
the
letter
from
Breda
,
he
gave
no
real
promise
to
govern
well
,
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
make
him
pledge
himself
beforehand
as
to
what
he
should
be
bound
to
do
for
the
benefit
of
the
kingdom
.
 
<EOS>
Monk
said
,
however
,
it
would
be
all
right
when
he
came
,
and
he
could
not
come
too
soon
.
  
<EOS>
So
,
everybody
found
out
all
in
a
moment
that
the
country
MUST
be
prosperous
and
happy
,
having
another
Stuart
to
condescend
to
reign
over
it
;
and
there
was
a
prodigious
firing
off
of
guns
,
lighting
of
bonfires
,
ringing
of
bells
,
and
throwing
up
of
caps
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
drank
the
King
's
health
by
thousands
in
the
open
streets
,
and
everybody
rejoiced
.
 
<EOS>
Down
came
the
Arms
of
the
Commonwealth
,
up
went
the
Royal
Arms
instead
,
and
out
came
the
public
money
.
 
<EOS>
Fifty
thousand
pounds
for
the
King
,
ten
thousand
pounds
for
his
brother
the
Duke
of
York
,
five
thousand
pounds
for
his
brother
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
.
 
<EOS>
Prayers
for
these
gracious
Stuarts
were
put
up
in
all
the
churches
;
commissioners
were
sent
to
Holland
(
which
suddenly
found
out
that
Charles
was
a
great
man
,
and
that
it
loved
him
)
to
invite
the
King
home
;
Monk
and
the
Kentish
grandees
went
to
Dover
,
to
kneel
down
before
him
as
he
landed
.
 
<EOS>
He
kissed
and
embraced
Monk
,
made
him
ride
in
the
coach
with
himself
and
his
brothers
,
came
on
to
London
amid
wonderful
shoutings
,
and
passed
through
the
army
at
Blackheath
on
the
twenty
-
ninth
of
May
(
his
birthday
)
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
sixty
.
 
<EOS>
Greeted
by
splendid
dinners
under
tents
,
by
flags
and
tapestry
streaming
from
all
the
houses
,
by
delighted
crowds
in
all
the
streets
,
by
troops
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
in
rich
dresses
,
by
City
companies
,
train
-
bands
,
drummers
,
trumpeters
,
the
great
Lord
Mayor
,
and
the
majestic
Aldermen
,
the
King
went
on
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
On
entering
it
,
he
commemorated
his
Restoration
with
the
joke
that
it
really
would
seem
to
have
been
his
own
fault
that
he
had
not
come
long
ago
,
since
everybody
told
him
that
he
had
always
wished
for
him
with
all
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
England
under
Charles
the
Second
,
Called
the
Merry
Monarch
    
THERE
never
were
such
profligate
times
in
England
as
under
Charles
the
Second
.
 
<EOS>
Whenever
you
see
his
portrait
,
with
his
swarthy
,
ill
-
looking
face
and
great
nose
,
you
may
fancy
him
in
his
Court
at
Whitehall
,
surrounded
by
some
of
the
very
worst
vagabonds
in
the
kingdom
(
though
they
were
lords
and
ladies
)
,
drinking
,
gambling
,
indulging
in
vicious
conversation
,
and
committing
every
kind
of
profligate
excess
.
 
<EOS>
It
has
been
a
fashion
to
call
Charles
the
Second
"
The
Merry
Monarch
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Let
me
try
to
give
you
a
general
idea
of
some
of
the
merry
things
that
were
done
,
in
the
merry
days
when
this
merry
gentleman
sat
upon
his
merry
throne
,
in
merry
England
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
merry
proceeding
was
---
of
course
---
to
declare
that
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
,
the
wisest
,
and
the
noblest
kings
that
ever
shone
,
like
the
blessed
sun
itself
,
on
this
benighted
earth
.
 
<EOS>
The
next
merry
and
pleasant
piece
of
business
was
,
for
the
Parliament
,
in
the
humblest
manner
,
to
give
him
one
million
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
to
settle
upon
him
for
life
that
old
disputed
tonnage
and
poundage
which
had
been
so
bravely
fought
for
.
<EOS>
Then
,
General
Monk
being
made
EARL
OF
ALBEMARLE
,
and
a
few
other
Royalists
similarly
rewarded
,
the
law
went
to
work
to
see
what
was
to
be
done
to
those
persons
(
they
were
called
Regicides
)
who
had
been
concerned
in
making
a
martyr
of
the
late
King
.
 
<EOS>
Ten
of
these
were
merrily
executed
;
that
is
to
say
,
six
of
the
judges
,
one
of
the
council
,
Colonel
Hacker
and
another
officer
who
had
commanded
the
Guards
,
and
HUGH
PETERS
,
a
preacher
who
had
preached
against
the
martyr
with
all
his
heart
.
 
<EOS>
These
executions
were
so
extremely
merry
,
that
every
horrible
circumstance
which
Cromwell
had
abandoned
was
revived
with
appalling
cruelty
.
 
<EOS>
The
hearts
of
the
sufferers
were
torn
out
of
their
living
bodies
;
their
bowels
were
burned
before
their
faces
;
the
executioner
cut
jokes
to
the
next
victim
,
as
he
rubbed
his
filthy
hands
together
,
that
were
reeking
with
the
blood
of
the
last
;
and
the
heads
of
the
dead
were
drawn
on
sledges
with
the
living
to
the
place
of
suffering
.
 
<EOS>
Still
,
even
so
merry
a
monarch
could
not
force
one
of
these
dying
men
to
say
that
he
was
sorry
for
what
he
had
done
.
 
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
most
memorable
thing
said
among
them
was
,
that
if
the
thing
were
to
do
again
they
would
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Sir
Harry
Vane
,
who
had
furnished
the
evidence
against
Strafford
,
and
was
one
of
the
most
staunch
of
the
Republicans
,
was
also
tried
,
found
guilty
,
and
ordered
for
execution
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
came
upon
the
scaffold
on
Tower
Hill
,
after
conducting
his
own
defence
with
great
power
,
his
notes
of
what
he
had
meant
to
say
to
the
people
were
torn
away
from
him
,
and
the
drums
and
trumpets
were
ordered
to
sound
lustily
and
drown
his
voice
;
for
,
the
people
had
been
so
much
impressed
by
what
the
Regicides
had
calmly
said
with
their
last
breath
,
that
it
was
the
custom
now
,
to
have
the
drums
and
trumpets
always
under
the
scaffold
,
ready
to
strike
up
.
 
<EOS>
Vane
said
no
more
than
this
:
 
<EOS>
"
It
is
a
bad
cause
which
can
not
bear
the
words
of
a
dying
man
:
"
and
bravely
died
.
  
<EOS>
These
merry
scenes
were
succeeded
by
another
,
perhaps
even
merrier
.
<EOS>
On
the
anniversary
of
the
late
King
's
death
,
the
bodies
of
Oliver
Cromwell
,
Ireton
,
and
Bradshaw
,
were
torn
out
of
their
graves
in
Westminster
Abbey
,
dragged
to
Tyburn
,
hanged
there
on
a
gallows
all
day
long
,
and
then
beheaded
.
 
<EOS>
Imagine
the
head
of
Oliver
Cromwell
set
upon
a
pole
to
be
stared
at
by
a
brutal
crowd
,
not
one
of
whom
would
have
dared
to
look
the
living
Oliver
in
the
face
for
half
a
moment
!
 
<EOS>
Think
,
after
you
have
read
this
reign
,
what
England
was
under
Oliver
Cromwell
who
was
torn
out
of
his
grave
,
and
what
it
was
under
this
merry
monarch
who
sold
it
,
like
a
merry
Judas
,
over
and
over
again
.
  
<EOS>
Of
course
,
the
remains
of
Oliver
's
wife
and
daughter
were
not
to
be
spared
either
,
though
they
had
been
most
excellent
women
.
 
<EOS>
The
base
clergy
of
that
time
gave
up
their
bodies
,
which
had
been
buried
in
the
Abbey
,
and
---
to
the
eternal
disgrace
of
England
---
they
were
thrown
into
a
pit
,
together
with
the
mouldering
bones
of
Pym
and
of
the
brave
and
bold
old
Admiral
Blake
.
  
<EOS>
The
clergy
acted
this
disgraceful
part
because
they
hoped
to
get
the
nonconformists
,
or
dissenters
,
thoroughly
put
down
in
this
reign
,
and
to
have
but
one
prayer
-
book
and
one
service
for
all
kinds
of
people
,
no
matter
what
their
private
opinions
were
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
pretty
well
,
I
think
,
for
a
Protestant
Church
,
which
had
displaced
the
Romish
Church
because
people
had
a
right
to
their
own
opinions
in
religious
matters
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
they
carried
it
with
a
high
hand
,
and
a
prayer
-
book
was
agreed
upon
,
in
which
the
extremest
opinions
of
Archbishop
Laud
were
not
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
An
Act
was
passed
,
too
,
preventing
any
dissenter
from
holding
any
office
under
any
corporation
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
the
regular
clergy
in
their
triumph
were
soon
as
merry
as
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
army
being
by
this
time
disbanded
,
and
the
King
crowned
,
everything
was
to
go
on
easily
for
evermore
.
  
<EOS>
I
must
say
a
word
here
about
the
King
's
family
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
long
upon
the
throne
when
his
brother
the
Duke
of
Gloucester
,
and
his
sister
the
PRINCESS
OF
ORANGE
,
died
within
a
few
months
of
each
other
,
of
small
-
pox
.
 
<EOS>
His
remaining
sister
,
the
PRINCESS
HENRIETTA
,
married
the
DUKE
OF
ORLEANS
,
the
brother
of
LOUIS
THE
FOURTEENTH
,
King
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
His
brother
JAMES
,
DUKE
OF
YORK
,
was
made
High
Admiral
,
and
by
-
and
-
by
became
a
Catholic
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
gloomy
,
sullen
,
bilious
sort
of
man
,
with
a
remarkable
partiality
for
the
ugliest
women
in
the
country
.
 
<EOS>
He
married
,
under
very
discreditable
circumstances
,
ANNE
HYDE
,
the
daughter
of
LORD
CLARENDON
,
then
the
King
's
principal
Minister
---
not
at
all
a
delicate
minister
either
,
but
doing
much
of
the
dirty
work
of
a
very
dirty
palace
.
 
<EOS>
It
became
important
now
that
the
King
himself
should
be
married
;
and
divers
foreign
Monarchs
,
not
very
particular
about
the
character
of
their
son
-
in
-
law
,
proposed
their
daughters
to
him
.
 
<EOS>
The
KING
OF
PORTUGAL
offered
his
daughter
,
CATHERINE
OF
BRAGANZA
,
and
fifty
thousand
pounds
:
 
in
addition
to
which
,
the
French
King
,
who
was
favourable
to
that
match
,
offered
a
loan
of
another
fifty
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
of
Spain
,
on
the
other
hand
,
offered
any
one
out
of
a
dozen
of
Princesses
,
and
other
hopes
of
gain
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
ready
money
carried
the
day
,
and
Catherine
came
over
in
state
to
her
merry
marriage
.
  
<EOS>
The
whole
Court
was
a
great
flaunting
crowd
of
debauched
men
and
shameless
women
;
and
Catherine
's
merry
husband
insulted
and
outraged
her
in
every
possible
way
,
until
she
consented
to
receive
those
worthless
creatures
as
her
very
good
friends
,
and
to
degrade
herself
by
their
companionship
.
 
<EOS>
A
MRS
.
PALMER
,
whom
the
King
made
LADY
CASTLEMAINE
,
and
afterwards
DUCHESS
OF
CLEVELAND
,
was
one
of
the
most
powerful
of
the
bad
women
about
the
Court
,
and
had
great
influence
with
the
King
nearly
all
through
his
reign
.
 
<EOS>
Another
merry
lady
named
MOLL
DAVIES
,
a
dancer
at
the
theatre
,
was
afterwards
her
rival
.
 
<EOS>
So
was
NELL
GWYN
,
first
an
orange
girl
and
then
an
actress
,
who
really
had
good
in
her
,
and
of
whom
one
of
the
worst
things
I
know
is
,
that
actually
she
does
seem
to
have
been
fond
of
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
first
DUKE
OF
ST
.
<EOS>
ALBANS
was
this
orange
girl
's
child
.
 
<EOS>
In
like
manner
the
son
of
a
merry
waiting
-
lady
,
whom
the
King
created
DUCHESS
OF
PORTSMOUTH
,
became
the
DUKE
OF
RICHMOND
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
the
whole
it
is
not
so
bad
a
thing
to
be
a
commoner
.
  
<EOS>
The
Merry
Monarch
was
so
exceedingly
merry
among
these
merry
ladies
,
and
some
equally
merry
(
and
equally
infamous
)
lords
and
gentlemen
,
that
he
soon
got
through
his
hundred
thousand
pounds
,
and
then
,
by
way
of
raising
a
little
pocket
-
money
,
made
a
merry
bargain
.
 
<EOS>
He
sold
Dunkirk
to
the
French
King
for
five
millions
of
livres
.
 
<EOS>
When
I
think
of
the
dignity
to
which
Oliver
Cromwell
raised
England
in
the
eyes
of
foreign
powers
,
and
when
I
think
of
the
manner
in
which
he
gained
for
England
this
very
Dunkirk
,
I
am
much
inclined
to
consider
that
if
the
Merry
Monarch
had
been
made
to
follow
his
father
for
this
action
,
he
would
have
received
his
just
deserts
.
  
<EOS>
Though
he
was
like
his
father
in
none
of
that
father
's
greater
qualities
,
he
was
like
him
in
being
worthy
of
no
trust
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
sent
that
letter
to
the
Parliament
,
from
Breda
,
he
did
expressly
promise
that
all
sincere
religious
opinions
should
be
respected
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
was
no
sooner
firm
in
his
power
than
he
consented
to
one
of
the
worst
Acts
of
Parliament
ever
passed
.
 
<EOS>
Under
this
law
,
every
minister
who
should
not
give
his
solemn
assent
to
the
Prayer
-
Book
by
a
certain
day
,
was
declared
to
be
a
minister
no
longer
,
and
to
be
deprived
of
his
church
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
this
was
that
some
two
thousand
honest
men
were
taken
from
their
congregations
,
and
reduced
to
dire
poverty
and
distress
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
followed
by
another
outrageous
law
,
called
the
Conventicle
Act
,
by
which
any
person
above
the
age
of
sixteen
who
was
present
at
any
religious
service
not
according
to
the
Prayer
-
Book
,
was
to
be
imprisoned
three
months
for
the
first
offence
,
six
for
the
second
,
and
to
be
transported
for
the
third
.
 
<EOS>
This
Act
alone
filled
the
prisons
,
which
were
then
most
dreadful
dungeons
,
to
overflowing
.
  
<EOS>
The
Covenanters
in
Scotland
had
already
fared
no
better
.
 
<EOS>
A
base
Parliament
,
usually
known
as
the
Drunken
Parliament
,
in
consequence
of
its
principal
members
being
seldom
sober
,
had
been
got
together
to
make
laws
against
the
Covenanters
,
and
to
force
all
men
to
be
of
one
mind
in
religious
matters
.
 
<EOS>
The
MARQUIS
OF
ARGYLE
,
relying
on
the
King
's
honour
,
had
given
himself
up
to
him
;
but
,
he
was
wealthy
,
and
his
enemies
wanted
his
wealth
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tried
for
treason
,
on
the
evidence
of
some
private
letters
in
which
he
had
expressed
opinions
---
as
well
he
might
---
more
favourable
to
the
government
of
the
late
Lord
Protector
than
of
the
present
merry
and
religious
King
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
executed
,
as
were
two
men
of
mark
among
the
Covenanters
;
and
SHARP
,
a
traitor
who
had
once
been
the
friend
of
the
Presbyterians
and
betrayed
them
,
was
made
Archbishop
of
St
Andrew
's
,
to
teach
the
Scotch
how
to
like
bishops
.
  
<EOS>
Things
being
in
this
merry
state
at
home
,
the
Merry
Monarch
undertook
a
war
with
the
Dutch
;
principally
because
they
interfered
with
an
African
company
,
established
with
the
two
objects
of
buying
gold
-
dust
and
slaves
,
of
which
the
Duke
of
York
was
a
leading
member
.
 
<EOS>
After
some
preliminary
hostilities
,
the
said
Duke
sailed
to
the
coast
of
Holland
with
a
fleet
of
ninety
-
eight
vessels
of
war
,
and
four
fire
-
ships
.
 
<EOS>
This
engaged
with
the
Dutch
fleet
,
of
no
fewer
than
one
hundred
and
thirteen
ships
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
great
battle
between
the
two
forces
,
the
Dutch
lost
eighteen
ships
,
four
admirals
,
and
seven
thousand
men
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
English
on
shore
were
in
no
mood
of
exultation
when
they
heard
the
news
.
  
<EOS>
For
,
this
was
the
year
and
the
time
of
the
Great
Plague
in
London
.
<EOS>
During
the
winter
of
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
sixty
-
four
it
had
been
whispered
about
,
that
some
few
people
had
died
here
and
there
of
the
disease
called
the
Plague
,
in
some
of
the
unwholesome
suburbs
around
London
.
 
<EOS>
News
was
not
published
at
that
time
as
it
is
now
,
and
some
people
believed
these
rumours
,
and
some
disbelieved
them
,
and
they
were
soon
forgotten
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
in
the
month
of
May
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
sixty
-
five
,
it
began
to
be
said
all
over
the
town
that
the
disease
had
burst
out
with
great
violence
in
St
Giles
's
,
and
that
the
people
were
dying
in
great
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
This
soon
turned
out
to
be
awfully
true
.
 
<EOS>
The
roads
out
of
London
were
choked
up
by
people
endeavouring
to
escape
from
the
infected
city
,
and
large
sums
were
paid
for
any
kind
of
conveyance
.
<EOS>
The
disease
soon
spread
so
fast
,
that
it
was
necessary
to
shut
up
the
houses
in
which
sick
people
were
,
and
to
cut
them
off
from
communication
with
the
living
.
 
<EOS>
Every
one
of
these
houses
was
marked
on
the
outside
of
the
door
with
a
red
cross
,
and
the
words
,
Lord
,
have
mercy
upon
us
!
 
<EOS>
The
streets
were
all
deserted
,
grass
grew
in
the
public
ways
,
and
there
was
a
dreadful
silence
in
the
air
.
 
<EOS>
When
night
came
on
,
dismal
rumblings
used
to
be
heard
,
and
these
were
the
wheels
of
the
death
-
carts
,
attended
by
men
with
veiled
faces
and
holding
cloths
to
their
mouths
,
who
rang
doleful
bells
and
cried
in
a
loud
and
solemn
voice
,
"
Bring
out
your
dead
!
"
<EOS>
The
corpses
put
into
these
carts
were
buried
by
torchlight
in
great
pits
;
no
service
being
performed
over
them
;
all
men
being
afraid
to
stay
for
a
moment
on
the
brink
of
the
ghastly
graves
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
general
fear
,
children
ran
away
from
their
parents
,
and
parents
from
their
children
.
 
<EOS>
Some
who
were
taken
ill
,
died
alone
,
and
without
any
help
.
 
<EOS>
Some
were
stabbed
or
strangled
by
hired
nurses
who
robbed
them
of
all
their
money
,
and
stole
the
very
beds
on
which
they
lay
.
 
<EOS>
Some
went
mad
,
dropped
from
the
windows
,
ran
through
the
streets
,
and
in
their
pain
and
frenzy
flung
themselves
into
the
river
.
  
<EOS>
These
were
not
all
the
horrors
of
the
time
.
 
<EOS>
The
wicked
and
dissolute
,
in
wild
desperation
,
sat
in
the
taverns
singing
roaring
songs
,
and
were
stricken
as
they
drank
,
and
went
out
and
died
.
 
<EOS>
The
fearful
and
superstitious
persuaded
themselves
that
they
saw
supernatural
sights
---
burning
swords
in
the
sky
,
gigantic
arms
and
darts
.
 
<EOS>
Others
pretended
that
at
nights
vast
crowds
of
ghosts
walked
round
and
round
the
dismal
pits
.
 
<EOS>
One
madman
,
naked
,
and
carrying
a
brazier
full
of
burning
coals
upon
his
head
,
stalked
through
the
streets
,
crying
out
that
he
was
a
Prophet
,
commissioned
to
denounce
the
vengeance
of
the
Lord
on
wicked
London
.
 
<EOS>
Another
always
went
to
and
fro
,
exclaiming
,
"
Yet
forty
days
,
and
London
shall
be
destroyed
!
"
 
<EOS>
A
third
awoke
the
echoes
in
the
dismal
streets
,
by
night
and
by
day
,
and
made
the
blood
of
the
sick
run
cold
,
by
calling
out
incessantly
,
in
a
deep
hoarse
voice
,
"
O
,
the
great
and
dreadful
God
!
"
  
<EOS>
Through
the
months
of
July
and
August
and
September
,
the
Great
Plague
raged
more
and
more
.
 
<EOS>
Great
fires
were
lighted
in
the
streets
,
in
the
hope
of
stopping
the
infection
;
but
there
was
a
plague
of
rain
too
,
and
it
beat
the
fires
out
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
the
winds
which
usually
arise
at
that
time
of
the
year
which
is
called
the
equinox
,
when
day
and
night
are
of
equal
length
all
over
the
world
,
began
to
blow
,
and
to
purify
the
wretched
town
.
 
<EOS>
The
deaths
began
to
decrease
,
the
red
crosses
slowly
to
disappear
,
the
fugitives
to
return
,
the
shops
to
open
,
pale
frightened
faces
to
be
seen
in
the
streets
.
 
<EOS>
The
Plague
had
been
in
every
part
of
England
,
but
in
close
and
unwholesome
London
it
had
killed
one
hundred
thousand
people
.
  
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
Merry
Monarch
was
as
merry
as
ever
,
and
as
worthless
as
ever
.
 
<EOS>
All
this
time
,
the
debauched
lords
and
gentlemen
and
the
shameless
ladies
danced
and
gamed
and
drank
,
and
loved
and
hated
one
another
,
according
to
their
merry
ways
.
  
<EOS>
So
little
humanity
did
the
government
learn
from
the
late
affliction
,
that
one
of
the
first
things
the
Parliament
did
when
it
met
at
Oxford
(
being
as
yet
afraid
to
come
to
London
)
,
was
to
make
a
law
,
called
the
Five
Mile
Act
,
expressly
directed
against
those
poor
ministers
who
,
in
the
time
of
the
Plague
,
had
manfully
come
back
to
comfort
the
unhappy
people
.
 
<EOS>
This
infamous
law
,
by
forbidding
them
to
teach
in
any
school
,
or
to
come
within
five
miles
of
any
city
,
town
,
or
village
,
doomed
them
to
starvation
and
death
.
  
<EOS>
The
fleet
had
been
at
sea
,
and
healthy
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
of
France
was
now
in
alliance
with
the
Dutch
,
though
his
navy
was
chiefly
employed
in
looking
on
while
the
English
and
Dutch
fought
.
 
<EOS>
The
Dutch
gained
one
victory
;
and
the
English
gained
another
and
a
greater
;
and
Prince
Rupert
,
one
of
the
English
admirals
,
was
out
in
the
Channel
one
windy
night
,
looking
for
the
French
Admiral
,
with
the
intention
of
giving
him
something
more
to
do
than
he
had
had
yet
,
when
the
gale
increased
to
a
storm
,
and
blew
him
into
Saint
Helen
's
.
 
<EOS>
That
night
was
the
third
of
September
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
sixty
-
six
,
and
that
wind
fanned
the
Great
Fire
of
London
.
  
<EOS>
It
broke
out
at
a
baker
's
shop
near
London
Bridge
,
on
the
spot
on
which
the
Monument
now
stands
as
a
remembrance
of
those
raging
flames
.
 
<EOS>
It
spread
and
spread
,
and
burned
and
burned
,
for
three
days
.
 
<EOS>
The
nights
were
lighter
than
the
days
;
in
the
daytime
there
was
an
immense
cloud
of
smoke
,
and
in
the
night
-
time
there
was
a
great
tower
of
fire
mounting
up
into
the
sky
,
which
lighted
the
whole
country
landscape
for
ten
miles
round
.
 
<EOS>
Showers
of
hot
ashes
rose
into
the
air
and
fell
on
distant
places
;
flying
sparks
carried
the
conflagration
to
great
distances
,
and
kindled
it
in
twenty
new
spots
at
a
time
;
church
steeples
fell
down
with
tremendous
crashes
;
<EOS>
houses
crumbled
into
cinders
by
the
hundred
and
the
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
The
summer
had
been
intensely
hot
and
dry
,
the
streets
were
very
narrow
,
and
the
houses
mostly
built
of
wood
and
plaster
.
 
<EOS>
Nothing
could
stop
the
tremendous
fire
,
but
the
want
of
more
houses
to
burn
;
nor
did
it
stop
until
the
whole
way
from
the
Tower
to
Temple
Bar
was
a
desert
,
composed
of
the
ashes
of
thirteen
thousand
houses
and
eighty
-
nine
churches
.
  
<EOS>
This
was
a
terrible
visitation
at
the
time
,
and
occasioned
great
loss
and
suffering
to
the
two
hundred
thousand
burnt
-
out
people
,
who
were
obliged
to
lie
in
the
fields
under
the
open
night
sky
,
or
in
hastily
-
made
huts
of
mud
and
straw
,
while
the
lanes
and
roads
were
rendered
impassable
by
carts
which
had
broken
down
as
they
tried
to
save
their
goods
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Fire
was
a
great
blessing
to
the
City
afterwards
,
for
it
arose
from
its
ruins
very
much
improved
---
<EOS>
built
more
regularly
,
more
widely
,
more
cleanly
and
carefully
,
and
therefore
much
more
healthily
.
 
<EOS>
It
might
be
far
more
healthy
than
it
is
,
but
there
are
some
people
in
it
still
---
even
now
<EOS>
,
at
this
time
,
nearly
two
hundred
years
later
---
so
selfish
,
so
pig
-
headed
,
and
so
ignorant
,
that
I
doubt
if
even
another
Great
Fire
would
warm
them
up
to
do
their
duty
.
  
<EOS>
The
Catholics
were
accused
of
having
wilfully
set
London
in
flames
;
one
poor
Frenchman
,
who
had
been
mad
for
years
,
even
accused
himself
of
having
with
his
own
hand
fired
the
first
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
is
no
reasonable
doubt
,
however
,
that
the
fire
was
accidental
.
 
<EOS>
An
inscription
on
the
Monument
long
attributed
it
to
the
Catholics
;
but
it
is
removed
now
,
and
was
always
a
malicious
and
stupid
untruth
.
  
<EOS>
Second
Part
    
<EOS>
THAT
the
Merry
Monarch
might
be
very
merry
indeed
,
in
the
merry
times
when
his
people
were
suffering
under
pestilence
and
fire
,
he
drank
and
gambled
and
flung
away
among
his
favourites
the
money
which
the
Parliament
had
voted
for
the
war
.
 
<EOS>
The
consequence
of
this
was
that
the
stout
-
hearted
English
sailors
were
merrily
starving
of
want
,
and
dying
in
the
streets
;
while
the
Dutch
,
under
their
admirals
DE
WITT
and
DE
RUYTER
,
came
into
the
River
Thames
,
and
up
the
River
Medway
as
far
as
Upnor
,
burned
the
guard
-
ships
,
silenced
the
weak
batteries
,
and
did
what
they
would
to
the
English
coast
for
six
whole
weeks
.
 
<EOS>
Most
of
the
English
ships
that
could
have
prevented
them
had
neither
powder
nor
shot
on
board
;
in
this
merry
reign
,
public
officers
made
themselves
as
merry
as
the
King
did
with
the
public
money
;
and
when
it
was
entrusted
to
them
to
spend
in
national
defences
or
preparations
,
they
put
it
into
their
own
pockets
with
the
merriest
grace
in
the
world
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Clarendon
had
,
by
this
time
,
run
as
long
a
course
as
is
usually
allotted
to
the
unscrupulous
ministers
of
bad
kings
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
impeached
by
his
political
opponents
,
but
unsuccessfully
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
then
commanded
him
to
withdraw
from
England
and
retire
to
France
,
which
he
did
,
after
defending
himself
in
writing
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
no
great
loss
at
home
,
and
died
abroad
some
seven
years
afterwards
.
  
<EOS>
There
then
came
into
power
a
ministry
called
the
Cabal
Ministry
,
because
it
was
composed
of
LORD
CLIFFORD
,
the
EARL
OF
ARLINGTON
,
the
DUKE
OF
BUCKINGHAM
(
a
great
rascal
,
and
the
King
's
most
powerful
favourite
)
,
LORD
ASHLEY
,
and
the
DUKE
OF
LAUDERDALE
,
C*A*B*A*L.
 
<EOS>
As
the
French
were
making
conquests
in
Flanders
,
the
first
Cabal
proceeding
was
to
make
a
treaty
with
the
Dutch
,
for
uniting
with
Spain
to
oppose
the
French
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
no
sooner
made
than
the
Merry
Monarch
,
who
always
wanted
to
get
money
without
being
accountable
to
a
Parliament
for
his
expenditure
,
<EOS>
apologised
to
the
King
of
France
for
having
had
anything
to
do
with
it
,
and
concluded
a
secret
treaty
with
him
,
making
himself
his
infamous
pensioner
to
the
amount
of
two
millions
of
livres
down
,
and
three
millions
more
a
year
;
and
engaging
to
desert
that
very
Spain
,
to
make
war
against
those
very
Dutch
,
and
to
declare
himself
a
Catholic
when
a
convenient
time
should
arrive
.
 
<EOS>
This
religious
king
had
lately
been
crying
to
his
Catholic
brother
on
the
subject
of
his
strong
desire
to
be
a
Catholic
;
and
now
he
merrily
concluded
this
treasonable
conspiracy
against
the
country
he
governed
,
by
undertaking
to
become
one
as
soon
as
he
safely
could
.
 
<EOS>
For
all
of
which
,
though
he
had
had
ten
merry
heads
instead
of
one
,
he
richly
deserved
to
lose
them
by
the
headsman
's
axe
.
  
<EOS>
As
his
one
merry
head
might
have
been
far
from
safe
,
if
these
things
had
been
known
,
they
were
kept
very
quiet
,
and
war
was
declared
by
France
and
England
against
the
Dutch
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
a
very
uncommon
man
,
afterwards
most
important
to
English
history
and
to
the
religion
and
liberty
of
this
land
,
arose
among
them
,
and
for
many
long
years
defeated
the
whole
projects
of
France
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
WILLIAM
OF
NASSAU
,
PRINCE
OF
ORANGE
,
son
of
the
last
Prince
of
Orange
of
the
same
name
,
who
married
the
daughter
of
Charles
the
First
of
England
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
young
man
at
this
time
,
only
just
of
age
;
but
he
was
brave
,
cool
,
intrepid
,
and
wise
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
had
been
so
detested
that
,
upon
his
death
,
the
Dutch
had
abolished
the
authority
to
which
this
son
would
have
otherwise
succeeded
(
Stadtholder
it
was
called
)
,
and
placed
the
chief
power
in
the
hands
of
JOHN
DE
WITT
,
who
educated
this
young
prince
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
the
Prince
became
very
popular
,
and
John
de
Witt
's
brother
CORNELIUS
was
sentenced
to
banishment
on
a
false
accusation
of
conspiring
to
kill
him
.
 
<EOS>
John
went
to
the
prison
where
he
was
,
to
take
him
away
to
exile
,
in
his
coach
;
and
a
great
mob
who
collected
on
the
occasion
,
then
and
there
cruelly
murdered
both
the
brothers
.
 
<EOS>
This
left
the
government
in
the
hands
of
the
Prince
,
who
was
really
the
choice
of
the
nation
;
and
from
this
time
he
exercised
it
with
the
greatest
vigour
,
against
the
whole
power
of
France
,
under
its
famous
generals
CONDE
and
TURENNE
,
and
in
support
of
the
Protestant
religion
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
full
seven
years
before
this
war
ended
in
a
treaty
of
peace
made
at
Nimeguen
,
and
its
details
would
occupy
a
very
considerable
space
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
say
that
William
of
Orange
established
a
famous
character
with
the
whole
world
;
and
that
the
Merry
Monarch
,
adding
to
and
improving
on
his
former
baseness
,
bound
himself
to
do
everything
the
King
of
France
liked
,
and
nothing
the
King
of
France
did
not
like
,
for
a
pension
of
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
which
was
afterwards
doubled
.
<EOS>
Besides
this
,
the
King
of
France
,
by
means
of
his
corrupt
ambassador
---
who
wrote
accounts
of
his
proceedings
in
England
,
which
are
not
always
to
be
believed
,
I
think
---
bought
our
English
members
of
Parliament
,
as
he
wanted
them
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
in
point
of
fact
,
during
a
considerable
portion
of
this
merry
reign
,
the
King
of
France
was
the
real
King
of
this
country
.
  
<EOS>
But
there
was
a
better
time
to
come
,
and
it
was
to
come
(
though
his
royal
uncle
little
thought
so
)
through
that
very
William
,
Prince
of
Orange
.
 
<EOS>
He
came
over
to
England
,
saw
Mary
,
the
elder
daughter
of
the
Duke
of
York
,
and
married
her
.
 
<EOS>
We
shall
see
by
-
and
-
by
what
came
of
that
marriage
,
and
why
it
is
never
to
be
forgotten
.
  
<EOS>
This
daughter
was
a
Protestant
,
but
her
mother
died
a
Catholic
.
<EOS>
She
and
her
sister
ANNE
,
also
a
Protestant
,
were
the
only
survivors
of
eight
children
.
 
<EOS>
Anne
afterwards
married
GEORGE
,
PRINCE
OF
DENMARK
,
brother
to
the
King
of
that
country
.
  
<EOS>
Lest
you
should
do
the
Merry
Monarch
the
injustice
of
supposing
that
he
was
even
good
humoured
(
except
when
he
had
everything
his
own
way
)
,
or
that
he
was
high
spirited
and
honourable
,
I
will
mention
here
what
was
done
to
a
member
of
the
House
of
Commons
,
SIR
JOHN
COVENTRY
.
 
<EOS>
He
made
a
remark
in
a
debate
about
taxing
the
theatres
,
which
gave
the
King
offence
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
agreed
with
his
illegitimate
son
,
who
had
been
born
abroad
,
and
whom
he
had
made
DUKE
OF
MONMOUTH
,
to
take
the
following
merry
vengeance
.
 
<EOS>
To
waylay
him
at
night
,
fifteen
armed
men
to
one
,
and
to
slit
his
nose
with
a
penknife
.
 
<EOS>
Like
master
,
like
man
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
favourite
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
was
strongly
suspected
of
setting
on
an
assassin
to
murder
the
DUKE
OF
ORMOND
as
he
was
returning
home
from
a
dinner
;
and
that
Duke
's
spirited
son
,
LORD
OSSORY
,
was
so
persuaded
of
his
guilt
,
that
he
said
to
him
at
Court
,
<EOS>
even
as
he
stood
beside
the
King
,
"
My
lord
,
I
know
very
well
that
you
are
at
the
bottom
of
this
late
attempt
upon
my
father
.
 
<EOS>
But
I
give
you
warning
,
<EOS>
if
he
ever
come
to
a
violent
end
,
his
blood
shall
be
upon
you
,
and
wherever
I
meet
you
I
will
pistol
you
!
 
<EOS>
I
will
do
so
,
though
I
find
you
standing
behind
the
King
's
chair
;
and
I
tell
you
this
in
his
Majesty
's
presence
,
that
you
may
be
quite
sure
of
my
doing
what
I
threaten
.
"
 
<EOS>
Those
were
merry
times
indeed
.
  
<EOS>
There
was
a
fellow
named
BLOOD
,
who
was
seized
for
making
,
with
two
companions
,
an
audacious
attempt
to
steal
the
crown
,
the
globe
,
and
sceptre
,
from
the
place
where
the
jewels
were
kept
in
the
Tower
.
<EOS>
This
robber
,
who
was
a
swaggering
ruffian
,
being
taken
,
declared
that
he
was
the
man
who
had
endeavoured
to
kill
the
Duke
of
Ormond
,
and
that
he
had
meant
to
kill
the
King
too
,
but
was
overawed
by
the
majesty
of
his
appearance
,
when
he
might
otherwise
have
done
it
,
as
he
was
bathing
at
Battersea
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
being
but
an
ill
-
looking
fellow
<EOS>
,
I
do
n't
believe
a
word
of
this
.
 
<EOS>
Whether
he
was
flattered
,
or
whether
he
knew
that
Buckingham
had
really
set
Blood
on
to
murder
the
Duke
,
is
uncertain
.
 
<EOS>
But
it
is
quite
certain
that
he
pardoned
this
thief
,
gave
him
an
estate
of
five
hundred
a
year
in
Ireland
(
which
had
had
the
honour
of
giving
him
birth
)
,
and
presented
him
at
Court
to
the
debauched
lords
and
the
shameless
ladies
,
who
made
a
great
deal
of
him
---
as
I
have
no
doubt
they
would
have
made
of
the
Devil
himself
,
if
the
King
had
introduced
him
.
  
<EOS>
Infamously
pensioned
as
he
was
,
the
King
still
wanted
money
,
and
consequently
was
obliged
to
call
Parliaments
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
,
the
great
object
of
the
Protestants
was
to
thwart
the
Catholic
Duke
of
York
,
who
married
a
second
time
;
his
new
wife
being
a
young
lady
only
fifteen
years
old
,
the
Catholic
sister
of
the
DUKE
OF
MODENA
.
 
<EOS>
In
this
they
were
seconded
by
the
Protestant
Dissenters
,
though
to
their
own
disadvantage
:
 
since
,
to
exclude
Catholics
from
power
,
they
were
even
willing
to
exclude
themselves
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
's
object
was
to
pretend
to
be
a
Protestant
,
while
he
was
really
a
Catholic
;
to
swear
to
the
bishops
that
he
was
devoutly
attached
to
the
English
Church
,
while
he
knew
he
had
bargained
it
away
to
the
King
of
France
;
and
by
cheating
and
deceiving
them
,
and
all
who
were
attached
to
royalty
,
to
become
despotic
and
be
powerful
enough
to
confess
what
a
rascal
he
was
.
 
<EOS>
Meantime
,
the
King
of
France
,
knowing
his
merry
pensioner
well
,
intrigued
with
the
King
's
opponents
in
Parliament
,
as
well
as
with
the
King
and
his
friends
.
  
<EOS>
The
fears
that
the
country
had
of
the
Catholic
religion
being
restored
,
if
the
Duke
of
York
should
come
to
the
throne
,
and
the
low
cunning
of
the
King
in
pretending
to
share
their
alarms
,
led
to
some
very
terrible
results
.
 
<EOS>
A
certain
DR
.
<EOS>
TONGE
,
a
dull
clergyman
in
the
City
,
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
certain
TITUS
OATES
,
a
most
infamous
character
,
who
pretended
to
have
acquired
among
the
Jesuits
abroad
a
knowledge
of
a
great
plot
for
the
murder
of
the
King
,
and
the
re
-
establishment
if
the
Catholic
religion
.
 
<EOS>
Titus
Oates
,
being
produced
by
this
unlucky
Dr.
Tonge
and
solemnly
examined
before
the
council
,
contradicted
himself
in
a
thousand
ways
,
told
the
most
ridiculous
and
improbable
stories
,
and
implicated
COLEMAN
,
the
Secretary
of
the
Duchess
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
Now
,
although
what
he
charged
against
Coleman
was
not
true
,
and
although
you
and
I
know
very
well
that
the
real
dangerous
Catholic
plot
was
that
one
with
the
King
of
France
of
which
the
Merry
Monarch
was
himself
the
head
,
there
happened
to
be
found
among
Coleman
's
papers
,
some
letters
,
in
which
he
did
praise
the
days
of
Bloody
Queen
Mary
,
and
abuse
the
Protestant
religion
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
great
good
fortune
for
Titus
,
as
it
seemed
to
confirm
him
;
but
better
still
was
in
store
.
 
<EOS>
SIR
EDMUNDBURY
GODFREY
,
the
magistrate
who
had
first
examined
him
,
being
unexpectedly
found
dead
near
Primrose
Hill
,
was
confidently
believed
to
have
been
killed
by
the
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
I
think
there
is
no
doubt
that
he
had
been
melancholy
mad
,
and
that
he
killed
himself
;
but
he
had
a
great
Protestant
funeral
,
and
Titus
was
called
the
Saver
of
the
Nation
,
and
received
a
pension
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
Oates
's
wickedness
had
met
with
this
success
,
up
started
another
villain
,
named
WILLIAM
BEDLOE
,
who
,
attracted
by
a
reward
of
five
hundred
pounds
offered
for
the
apprehension
of
the
murderers
of
Godfrey
,
came
forward
and
charged
two
Jesuits
and
some
other
persons
with
having
committed
it
at
the
Queen
's
desire
.
<EOS>
Oates
,
going
into
partnership
with
this
new
informer
,
had
the
audacity
to
accuse
the
poor
Queen
herself
of
high
treason
.
 
<EOS>
Then
appeared
a
third
informer
,
as
bad
as
either
of
the
two
,
and
accused
a
Catholic
banker
named
STAYLEY
of
having
said
that
the
King
was
the
greatest
rogue
in
the
world
(
which
would
not
have
been
far
from
the
truth
)
,
and
that
he
would
kill
him
with
his
own
hand
.
 
<EOS>
This
banker
,
being
at
once
tried
and
executed
,
Coleman
and
two
others
were
tried
and
executed
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
a
miserable
wretch
named
PRANCE
,
a
Catholic
silversmith
,
being
accused
by
Bedloe
,
was
tortured
into
confessing
that
he
had
taken
part
in
Godfrey
's
murder
,
and
into
accusing
three
other
men
of
having
committed
it
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
five
Jesuits
were
accused
by
Oates
,
Bedloe
,
and
Prance
together
,
and
were
all
found
guilty
,
and
executed
on
the
same
kind
of
contradictory
and
absurd
evidence
.
 
<EOS>
The
Queen
's
physician
and
three
monks
were
next
put
on
their
trial
;
but
Oates
and
Bedloe
had
for
the
time
gone
far
enough
and
these
four
were
acquitted
.
 
<EOS>
The
public
mind
,
however
,
was
so
full
of
a
Catholic
plot
,
and
so
strong
against
the
Duke
of
York
,
that
James
consented
to
obey
a
written
order
from
his
brother
,
and
to
go
with
his
family
to
Brussels
,
<EOS>
provided
that
his
rights
should
never
be
sacrificed
in
his
absence
to
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
,
not
satisfied
with
this
as
the
King
hoped
,
passed
a
bill
to
exclude
the
Duke
from
ever
succeeding
to
the
throne
.
 
<EOS>
In
return
,
the
King
dissolved
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
deserted
his
old
favourite
,
the
Duke
of
Buckingham
,
who
was
now
in
the
opposition
.
  
<EOS>
To
give
any
sufficient
idea
of
the
miseries
of
Scotland
in
this
merry
reign
,
would
occupy
a
hundred
pages
.
 
<EOS>
Because
the
people
would
not
have
bishops
,
and
were
resolved
to
stand
by
their
solemn
League
and
Covenant
,
such
cruelties
were
inflicted
upon
them
as
make
the
blood
run
cold
.
 
<EOS>
Ferocious
dragoons
galloped
through
the
country
to
punish
the
peasants
for
deserting
the
churches
;
sons
were
hanged
up
at
their
fathers
"
doors
for
refusing
to
disclose
where
their
fathers
were
concealed
;
wives
were
tortured
to
death
for
not
betraying
their
husbands
;
people
were
taken
out
of
their
fields
and
gardens
,
and
shot
on
the
public
roads
without
trial
;
lighted
matches
were
tied
to
the
fingers
of
prisoners
,
and
a
most
horrible
torment
called
the
Boot
was
invented
,
and
constantly
applied
,
which
ground
and
mashed
the
victims
"
legs
with
iron
wedges
.
 
<EOS>
Witnesses
were
tortured
as
well
as
prisoners
.
 
<EOS>
All
the
prisons
were
full
;
all
the
gibbets
were
heavy
with
bodies
;
murder
and
plunder
devastated
the
whole
country
.
 
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
,
the
Covenanters
were
by
no
means
to
be
dragged
into
the
churches
,
and
persisted
in
worshipping
God
as
they
thought
right
.
 
<EOS>
A
body
of
ferocious
Highlanders
,
turned
upon
them
from
the
mountains
of
their
own
country
,
had
no
greater
effect
than
the
English
dragoons
under
GRAHAME
OF
CLAVERHOUSE
,
the
most
cruel
and
rapacious
of
all
their
enemies
,
whose
name
will
ever
be
cursed
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
Scotland
.
 
<EOS>
Archbishop
Sharp
had
ever
aided
and
abetted
all
these
outrages
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
fell
at
last
;
for
,
when
the
injuries
of
the
Scottish
people
were
at
their
height
,
he
was
seen
,
in
his
coach
-
and
-
six
coming
across
a
moor
,
by
a
body
of
men
,
headed
by
one
JOHN
BALFOUR
,
who
were
waiting
for
another
of
their
oppressors
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
they
cried
out
that
Heaven
had
delivered
him
into
their
hands
,
and
killed
him
with
many
wounds
.
 
<EOS>
If
ever
a
man
deserved
such
a
death
,
I
think
Archbishop
Sharp
did
.
  
<EOS>
It
made
a
great
noise
directly
,
and
the
Merry
Monarch
---
strongly
suspected
of
having
goaded
the
Scottish
people
on
,
that
he
might
have
an
excuse
for
a
greater
army
than
the
Parliament
were
willing
to
give
him
---
sent
down
his
son
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
as
commander
-
in
-
chief
,
with
instructions
to
attack
the
Scottish
rebels
,
or
Whigs
as
they
were
called
,
whenever
he
came
up
with
them
.
 
<EOS>
Marching
with
ten
thousand
men
from
Edinburgh
,
he
found
them
,
in
number
four
or
five
thousand
,
drawn
up
at
Bothwell
Bridge
,
by
the
Clyde
.
 
<EOS>
They
were
soon
dispersed
;
and
Monmouth
showed
a
more
humane
character
towards
them
,
than
he
had
shown
towards
that
Member
of
Parliament
whose
nose
he
had
caused
to
be
slit
with
a
penknife
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
Duke
of
Lauderdale
was
their
bitter
foe
,
and
sent
Claverhouse
to
finish
them
.
  
<EOS>
As
the
Duke
of
York
became
more
and
more
unpopular
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
became
more
and
more
popular
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
decent
in
the
latter
not
to
have
voted
in
favour
of
the
renewed
bill
for
the
exclusion
of
James
from
the
throne
;
but
he
did
so
,
much
to
the
King
's
amusement
,
who
used
to
sit
in
the
House
of
Lords
by
the
fire
,
hearing
the
debates
,
which
he
said
were
as
good
as
a
play
.
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
passed
the
bill
by
a
large
majority
,
and
it
was
carried
up
to
the
House
of
Lords
by
LORD
RUSSELL
,
one
of
the
best
of
the
leaders
on
the
Protestant
side
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
rejected
there
,
chiefly
because
the
bishops
helped
the
King
to
get
rid
of
it
;
and
the
fear
of
Catholic
plots
revived
again
.
 
<EOS>
There
had
been
another
got
up
,
by
a
fellow
out
of
Newgate
,
named
DANGERFIELD
,
which
is
more
famous
than
it
deserves
to
be
,
under
the
name
of
the
MEAL
-
TUB
PLOT
.
 
<EOS>
This
jail
-
bird
having
been
got
out
of
Newgate
by
a
MRS
.
CELLIER
,
a
Catholic
nurse
,
had
turned
Catholic
himself
,
and
pretended
that
he
knew
of
a
plot
among
the
Presbyterians
against
the
King
's
life
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
very
pleasant
to
the
Duke
of
York
,
who
hated
the
Presbyterians
,
who
returned
the
compliment
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
Dangerfield
twenty
guineas
,
and
sent
him
to
the
King
his
brother
.
<EOS>
But
Dangerfield
,
breaking
down
altogether
in
his
charge
,
and
being
sent
back
to
Newgate
,
almost
astonished
the
Duke
out
of
his
five
senses
by
suddenly
swearing
that
the
Catholic
nurse
had
put
that
false
design
into
his
head
,
and
that
what
he
really
knew
about
,
was
,
a
Catholic
plot
against
the
King
;
the
evidence
of
which
would
be
found
in
some
papers
,
concealed
in
a
meal
-
tub
in
Mrs
Cellier
's
house
.
 
<EOS>
There
they
were
,
of
course
---
<EOS>
for
he
had
put
them
there
himself
---
and
so
the
tub
gave
the
name
to
the
plot
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
the
nurse
was
acquitted
on
her
trial
,
and
it
came
to
nothing
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Ashley
,
of
the
Cabal
,
was
now
Lord
Shaftesbury
,
and
was
strong
against
the
succession
of
the
Duke
of
York
.
 
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
,
aggravated
to
the
utmost
extent
,
as
we
may
well
suppose
,
by
suspicions
of
the
King
's
conspiracy
with
the
King
of
France
,
made
a
desperate
point
of
the
exclusion
,
still
,
and
were
bitter
against
the
Catholics
generally
.
 
<EOS>
So
unjustly
bitter
were
they
,
<EOS>
I
grieve
to
say
,
that
they
impeached
the
venerable
Lord
Stafford
,
a
Catholic
nobleman
seventy
years
old
,
of
a
design
to
kill
the
King
.
 
<EOS>
The
witnesses
were
that
atrocious
Oates
and
two
other
birds
of
the
same
feather
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
found
guilty
,
on
evidence
quite
as
foolish
as
it
was
false
,
and
was
beheaded
on
Tower
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
people
were
opposed
to
him
when
he
first
appeared
upon
the
scaffold
;
but
,
when
he
had
addressed
them
and
shown
them
how
innocent
he
was
and
how
wickedly
he
was
sent
there
,
their
better
nature
was
aroused
,
and
they
said
,
"
We
believe
you
,
my
Lord
.
 
<EOS>
God
bless
you
,
my
Lord
!
"
  
<EOS>
The
House
of
Commons
refused
to
let
the
King
have
any
money
until
he
should
consent
to
the
Exclusion
Bill
;
but
,
as
he
could
get
it
and
did
get
it
from
his
master
the
King
of
France
,
he
could
afford
to
hold
them
very
cheap
.
 
<EOS>
He
called
a
Parliament
at
Oxford
,
to
which
he
went
down
with
a
great
show
of
being
armed
and
protected
as
if
he
were
in
danger
of
his
life
,
and
to
which
the
opposition
members
also
went
armed
and
protected
,
alleging
that
they
were
in
fear
of
the
Papists
,
who
were
numerous
among
the
King
's
guards
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
went
on
with
the
Exclusion
Bill
,
and
were
so
earnest
upon
it
that
they
would
have
carried
it
again
,
if
the
King
had
not
popped
his
crown
and
state
robes
into
a
sedan
-
chair
,
bundled
himself
into
it
along
with
them
,
hurried
down
to
the
chamber
where
the
House
of
Lords
met
,
and
dissolved
the
Parliament
.
 
<EOS>
After
which
he
scampered
home
,
and
the
members
of
Parliament
scampered
home
too
,
as
fast
as
their
legs
could
carry
them
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
York
,
then
residing
in
Scotland
,
had
,
under
the
law
which
excluded
Catholics
from
public
trust
,
<EOS>
no
right
whatever
to
public
employment
.
 
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
was
openly
employed
as
the
King
's
representative
in
Scotland
,
and
there
gratified
his
sullen
and
cruel
nature
to
his
heart
's
content
by
directing
the
dreadful
cruelties
against
the
Covenanters
.
 
<EOS>
There
were
two
ministers
named
CARGILL
and
CAMERON
who
had
escaped
from
the
battle
of
Bothwell
Bridge
,
and
who
returned
to
Scotland
,
and
raised
the
miserable
but
still
brave
and
unsubdued
Covenanters
afresh
,
under
the
name
of
Cameronians
.
 
<EOS>
As
Cameron
publicly
posted
a
declaration
that
the
King
was
a
forsworn
tyrant
,
no
mercy
was
shown
to
his
unhappy
followers
after
he
was
slain
in
battle
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
York
,
who
was
particularly
fond
of
the
Boot
and
derived
great
pleasure
from
having
it
applied
,
offered
their
lives
to
some
of
these
people
,
if
they
would
cry
on
the
scaffold
"
God
save
the
King
!
"
 
<EOS>
But
their
relations
,
friends
,
and
countrymen
,
had
been
so
barbarously
tortured
and
murdered
in
this
merry
reign
,
that
they
preferred
to
die
,
and
did
die
.
 
<EOS>
The
Duke
then
obtained
his
merry
brother
's
permission
to
hold
a
Parliament
in
Scotland
,
which
first
,
with
most
shameless
deceit
,
confirmed
the
laws
for
securing
the
Protestant
religion
against
Popery
,
and
then
declared
that
nothing
must
or
should
prevent
the
succession
of
the
Popish
Duke
.
 
<EOS>
After
this
double
-
faced
beginning
,
it
established
an
oath
which
no
human
being
could
understand
,
but
<EOS>
which
everybody
was
to
take
,
as
a
proof
that
his
religion
was
the
lawful
religion
.
 
<EOS>
The
Earl
of
Argyle
,
taking
it
with
the
explanation
that
he
did
not
consider
it
to
prevent
him
from
favouring
any
alteration
either
in
the
Church
or
State
which
was
not
inconsistent
with
the
Protestant
religion
or
with
his
loyalty
,
was
tried
for
high
treason
before
a
Scottish
jury
of
which
the
MARQUIS
OF
MONTROSE
was
foreman
,
and
was
found
guilty
.
 
<EOS>
He
escaped
the
scaffold
,
for
that
time
,
by
getting
away
,
in
the
disguise
of
a
page
,
in
the
train
of
his
daughter
,
LADY
SOPHIA
LINDSAY
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
absolutely
proposed
,
by
certain
members
of
the
Scottish
Council
,
that
this
lady
should
be
whipped
through
the
streets
of
Edinburgh
.
 
<EOS>
But
this
was
too
much
even
for
the
Duke
,
who
had
the
manliness
then
<EOS>
(
he
had
very
little
at
most
times
)
to
remark
that
Englishmen
were
not
accustomed
to
treat
ladies
in
that
manner
.
<EOS>
In
those
merry
times
nothing
could
equal
the
brutal
servility
of
the
Scottish
fawners
,
but
the
conduct
of
similar
degraded
beings
in
England
.
  
<EOS>
After
the
settlement
of
these
little
affairs
,
the
Duke
returned
to
England
,
and
soon
resumed
his
place
at
the
Council
,
and
his
office
of
High
Admiral
---
all
this
by
his
brother
's
favour
,
and
in
open
defiance
of
the
law
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
no
loss
to
the
country
,
if
he
had
been
drowned
when
his
ship
,
in
going
to
Scotland
to
fetch
his
family
,
struck
on
a
sand
-
bank
,
and
was
lost
with
two
hundred
souls
on
board
.
 
<EOS>
But
he
escaped
in
a
boat
with
some
friends
;
and
the
sailors
were
so
brave
and
unselfish
,
that
,
when
they
saw
him
rowing
away
,
they
gave
three
cheers
,
while
they
themselves
were
going
down
for
ever
.
  
<EOS>
The
Merry
Monarch
,
having
got
rid
of
his
Parliament
,
went
to
work
to
make
himself
despotic
,
with
all
speed
.
 
<EOS>
Having
had
the
villainy
to
order
the
execution
of
OLIVER
PLUNKET
,
BISHOP
OF
ARMAGH
,
falsely
accused
of
a
plot
to
establish
Popery
in
that
country
by
means
of
a
French
army
---
the
very
thing
this
royal
traitor
was
himself
trying
to
do
at
home
---
and
having
tried
to
ruin
Lord
Shaftesbury
,
and

he
turned
his

to
controlling
the

all
over

only
do
that

he

what

<EOS>
These
merry
times
produced
,
and
made
Chief
Justice
of
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
,
a
drunken
ruffian
of
the
name
of
JEFFREYS
;
a
red
-
faced
,
swollen
,
bloated
,
horrible
creature
,
with
a
bullying
,
roaring
voice
,
and
a
more
savage
nature
perhaps
than
was
ever
lodged
in
any
human
breast
.
 
<EOS>
This
monster
was
the
Merry
Monarch
's
especial
favourite
,
and
he
testified
his
admiration
of
him
by
giving
him
a
ring
from
his
own
finger
,
which
the
people
used
to
call
Judge
Jeffreys
's
Bloodstone
.
 
<EOS>
Him
the
King
employed
to
go
about
and
bully
the
corporations
,
beginning
with
London
;
or
,
as
Jeffreys
himself
elegantly
called
it
,
"
to
give
them
a
lick
with
the
rough
side
of
his
tongue
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
did
it
<EOS>
so
thoroughly
,
that
they
soon
became
the
basest
and
most
sycophantic
bodies
in
the
kingdom
---
except
the
University
of
Oxford
,
which
,
in
that
respect
,
was
quite
pre
-
eminent
and
unapproachable
.

Lord
Shaftesbury
(
who
died
soon
after
the
King
's
failure
against
him
)
,
<EOS>
LORD
WILLIAM
RUSSELL
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
LORD
HOWARD
,
LORD
JERSEY
,
ALGERNON
SIDNEY
,
JOHN
HAMPDEN
(
grandson
of
the
great
Hampden
)
,
and
some
others
,
used
to
hold
a
council
together
after
the
dissolution
of
the
Parliament
,
arranging
what
it
might
be
necessary
to
do
,
if
the
King
carried
his
Popish
plot
to
the
utmost
height
.
 
<EOS>
Lord
Shaftesbury
having
been
much
the
most
violent
of
this
party
,
brought
two
violent
men
into
their
secrets
---
RUMSEY
,
who
had
been
a
soldier
in
the
Republican
army
;
and
WEST
,
a
lawyer
.
 
<EOS>
These
two
knew
an
old
officer
of
CROMWELL
'S
,
called
RUMBOLD
,
who
had
married
a
maltster
's
widow
,
and
so
had
come
into
possession
of
a
solitary
dwelling
called
the
Rye
House
,
near
Hoddesdon
,
in
Hertfordshire
.
 
<EOS>
Rumbold
said
to
them
what
a
capital
place
this
house
of
his
would
be
from
which
to
shoot
at
the
King
,
who
often
passed
there
going
to
and
fro
from
Newmarket
.
 
<EOS>
They
liked
the
idea
,
and
entertained
it
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
one
of
their
body
gave
information
;
and
they
,
together
with
SHEPHERD
<EOS>
a
wine
merchant
,
Lord
Russell
,
Algernon
Sidney
,
LORD
ESSEX
,
LORD
HOWARD
,
and
Hampden
,
were
all
arrested
.
  
<EOS>
Lord
Russell
might
have
easily
escaped
,
but
scorned
to
do
so
,
being
innocent
of
any
wrong
;
Lord
Essex
might
have
easily
escaped
,
but
scorned
to
do
so
,
lest
his
flight
should
prejudice
Lord
Russell
.
<EOS>
But
it
weighed
upon
his
mind
that
he
had
brought
into
their
council
,
Lord
Howard
---
who
now
turned
a
miserable
traitor
---
against
a
great
dislike
Lord
Russell
had
always
had
of
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
could
not
bear
the
reflection
,
and
destroyed
himself
before
Lord
Russell
was
brought
to
trial
at
the
Old
Bailey
.
  
<EOS>
He
knew
very
well
that
he
had
nothing
to
hope
,
having
always
been
manful
in
the
Protestant
cause
against
the
two
false
brothers
,
the
one
on
the
throne
,
and
the
other
standing
next
to
it
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
a
wife
,
one
of
the
noblest
and
best
of
women
,
who
acted
as
his
secretary
on
his
trial
,
who
comforted
him
in
his
prison
,
who
supped
with
him
on
the
night
before
he
died
,
and
whose
love
and
virtue
and
devotion
have
made
her
name
imperishable
.
 
<EOS>
Of
course
,
he
was
found
guilty
,
and
was
sentenced
to
be
beheaded
in
Lincoln
's
Inn
-
fields
,
not
many
yards
from
his
own
house
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
parted
from
his
children
on
the
evening
before
his
death
,
his
wife
still
stayed
with
him
until
ten
o'clock
at
night
;
and
when
their
final
separation
in
this
world
was
over
,
and
he
had
kissed
her
many
times
,
he
still
sat
for
a
long
while
in
his
prison
,
talking
of
her
goodness
.
 
<EOS>
Hearing
the
rain
fall
fast
at
that
time
,
he
calmly
said
,
"
Such
a
rain
to
-
morrow
will
spoil
a
great
show
,
which
is
a
dull
thing
on
a
rainy
day
.
"
 
<EOS>
At
midnight
he
went
to
bed
,
and
slept
till
four
;
even
when
his
servant
called
him
,
he
fell
asleep
again
while
his
clothes
were
being
made
ready
.
 
<EOS>
He
rode
to
the
scaffold
in
his
own
carriage
,
attended
by
two
famous
clergymen
,
TILLOTSON
and
BURNET
,
and
sang
a
psalm
to
himself
very
softly
,
as
he
went
along
.
<EOS>
He
was
as
quiet
and
as
steady
as
if
he
had
been
going
out
for
an
ordinary
ride
.
 
<EOS>
After
saying
that
he
was
surprised
to
see
so
great
a
crowd
,
he
laid
down
his
head
upon
the
block
,
as
if
upon
the
pillow
of
his
bed
,
and
had
it
struck
off
at
the
second
blow
.
 
<EOS>
His
noble
wife
was
busy
for
him
even
then
;
for
that
true
-
hearted
lady
printed
and
widely
circulated
his
last
words
,
of
which
he
had
given
her
a
copy
.
 
<EOS>
They
made
the
blood
of
all
the
honest
men
in
England
boil
.
  
<EOS>
The
University
of
Oxford
distinguished
itself
on
the
very
same
day
by
pretending
to
believe
that
the
accusation
against
Lord
Russell
was
true
,
and
by
calling
the
King
,
in
a
written
paper
,
the
Breath
of
their
Nostrils
and
the
Anointed
of
the
Lord
.
 
<EOS>
This
paper
<EOS>
the
Parliament
afterwards
caused
to
be
burned
by
the
common
hangman
;
which
I
am
sorry
for
,
as
I
wish
it
had
been
framed
and
glazed
and
hung
up
in
some
public
place
,
as
a
monument
of
baseness
for
the
scorn
of
mankind
.
  
<EOS>
Next
,
came
the
trial
of
Algernon
Sidney
,
at
which
Jeffreys
presided
,
like
a
great
crimson
toad
,
sweltering
and
swelling
with
rage
.
 
<EOS>
"
I
pray
God
,
Mr
Sidney
,
"
said
this
Chief
Justice
of
a
merry
reign
,
after
passing
sentence
,
"
to
work
in
you
a
temper
fit
to
go
to
the
other
world
,
for
I
see
you
are
not
fit
for
this
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
"
My
lord
,
"
said
the
prisoner
,
composedly
holding
out
his
arm
,
"
feel
my
pulse
,
and
see
if
I
be
disordered
.
 
<EOS>
I
thank
Heaven
<EOS>
I
never
was
in
better
temper
than
I
am
now
.
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
Algernon
Sidney
was
executed
on
Tower
Hill
,
on
the
seventh
of
December
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
three
.
 
<EOS>
He
died
a
hero
,
and
died
,
in
his
own
words
,
"
For
that
good
old
cause
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
from
his
youth
,
and
for
which
God
had
so
often
and
so
wonderfully
declared
himself
.
"
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Monmouth
had
been
making
his
uncle
,
the
Duke
of
York
,
very
jealous
,
by
going
about
the
country
in
a
royal
sort
of
way
,
playing
at
the
people
's
games
,
becoming
godfather
to
their
children
,
and
even
touching
for
the
King
's
evil
,
or
stroking
the
faces
of
the
sick
to
cure
them
---
<EOS>
though
,
for
the
matter
of
that
,
I
should
say
he
did
them
about
as
much
good
as
any
crowned
king
could
have
done
.
 
<EOS>
His
father
had
got
him
to
write
a
letter
,
confessing
his
having
had
a
part
in
the
conspiracy
,
for
which
Lord
Russell
had
been
beheaded
;
but
he
was
ever
a
weak
man
,
and
as
soon
as
he
had
written
it
,
he
was
ashamed
of
it
and
got
it
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
For
this
,
he
was
banished
to
the
Netherlands
;
but
he
soon
returned
and
had
an
interview
with
his
father
,
unknown
to
his
uncle
.
 
<EOS>
It
would
seem
that
he
was
coming
into
the
Merry
Monarch
's
favour
again
,
and
that
the
Duke
of
York
was
sliding
out
of
it
,
when
Death
appeared
to
the
merry
galleries
at
Whitehall
,
and
astonished
the
debauched
lords
and
gentlemen
,
and
the
shameless
ladies
,
very
considerably
.
  
<EOS>
On
Monday
,
the
second
of
February
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
,
the
merry
pensioner
and
servant
of
the
King
of
France
fell
down
in
a
fit
of
apoplexy
.
 
<EOS>
By
the
Wednesday
his
case
was
hopeless
,
and
on
the
Thursday
he
was
told
so
.
 
<EOS>
As
he
made
a
difficulty
about
taking
the
sacrament
from
the
Protestant
Bishop
of
Bath
,
the
Duke
of
York
got
all
who
were
present
away
from
the
bed
,
and
asked
his
brother
,
in
a
whisper
,
if
he
should
send
for
a
Catholic
priest
?
  
<EOS>
The
King
replied
,
"
For
God
's
sake
,
brother
,
do
!
"
<EOS>
The
Duke
smuggled
in
,
up
the
back
stairs
,
disguised
in
a
wig
and
gown
,
a
priest
named
HUDDLESTON
,
who
had
saved
the
King
's
life
after
the
battle
of
Worcester
:
 
telling
him
that
this
worthy
man
in
the
wig
had
once
saved
his
body
,
and
was
now
come
to
save
his
soul
.
  
<EOS>
The
Merry
Monarch
lived
through
that
night
,
and
died
before
noon
on
the
next
day
,
which
was
Friday
,
the
sixth
.
 
<EOS>
Two
of
the
last
things
he
said
were
of
a
human
sort
,
and
your
remembrance
will
give
him
the
full
benefit
of
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Queen
sent
to
say
she
was
too
unwell
to
attend
him
and
to
ask
his
pardon
,
he
said
,
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
poor
woman
,
SHE
beg
MY
pardon
!
 
<EOS>
I
beg
hers
with
all
my
heart
.
 
<EOS>
Take
back
that
answer
to
her
.
"
 
<EOS>
And
he
also
said
,
in
reference
to
Nell
Gwyn
,
"
Do
not
let
poor
Nelly
starve
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
He
died
in
the
fifty
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
,
and
the
twenty
-
fifth
of
his
reign
.
    
<EOS>
England
Under
<EOS>
James
The
Second
    
KING
JAMES
<EOS>
THE
SECOND
was
a
man
so
very
disagreeable
,
that
even
the
best
of
historians
has
favoured
his
brother
Charles
,
as
becoming
,
by
comparison
,
quite
a
pleasant
character
.
 
<EOS>
The
one
object
of
his
short
reign
was
to
re
-
establish
the
Catholic
religion
in
England
;
and
this
he
doggedly
pursued
with
such
a
stupid
obstinacy
,
that
his
career
very
soon
came
to
a
close
.
  
<EOS>
The
first
thing
he
did
,
was
,
to
assure
his
council
that
he
would
make
it
his
endeavour
to
preserve
the
Government
,
both
in
Church
and
State
,
as
it
was
by
law
established
;
and
that
he
would
always
take
care
to
defend
and
support
the
Church
.
 
<EOS>
Great
public
acclamations
were
raised
over
this
fair
speech
,
and
a
great
deal
was
said
,
from
the
pulpits
and
elsewhere
,
about
the
word
of
a
King
which
was
never
broken
,
by
credulous
people
who
little
supposed
that
he
had
formed
a
secret
council
for
Catholic
affairs
,
of
which
a
mischievous
Jesuit
,
called
FATHER
PETRE
,
was
one
of
the
chief
members
.
 
<EOS>
With
tears
of
joy
in
his
eyes
,
he
received
,
as
the
beginning
of
HIS
pension
from
the
King
of
France
,
five
hundred
thousand
livres
;
yet
,
with
a
mixture
of
meanness
and
arrogance
that
belonged
to
his
contemptible
character
,
he
was
always
jealous
of
making
some
show
of
being
independent
of
the
King
of
France
,
while
he
pocketed
his
money
.
 
<EOS>
As
---
notwithstanding
his
publishing
two
papers
in
favour
of
Popery
(
and
not
likely
to
do
it
much
service
,
I
should
think
)
written
by
the
King
,
his
brother
,
and
found
in
his
strong
-
box
;
and
his
open
display
of
himself
attending
mass
---
the
Parliament
was
very
obsequious
,
and
granted
him
a
large
sum
of
money
,
he
began
his
reign
with
a
belief
that
he
could
do
what
he
pleased
,
and
with
a
determination
to
do
it
.
  
<EOS>
Before
we
proceed
to
its
principal
events
,
let
us
dispose
of
Titus
Oates
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
tried
for
perjury
,
a
fortnight
after
the
coronation
,
and
besides
being
very
heavily
fined
,
was
sentenced
to
stand
twice
in
the
pillory
,
to
be
whipped
from
Aldgate
to
Newgate
one
day
,
and
from
Newgate
to
Tyburn
two
days
afterwards
,
and
to
stand
in
the
pillory
five
times
a
year
as
long
as
he
lived
.
 
<EOS>
This
fearful
sentence
was
actually
inflicted
on
the
rascal
.
 
<EOS>
Being
unable
to
stand
after
his
first
flogging
,
he
was
dragged
on
a
sledge
from
Newgate
to
Tyburn
,
and
flogged
as
he
was
drawn
along
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
so
strong
a
villain
that
he
did
not
die
under
the
torture
,
but
lived
to
be
afterwards
pardoned
and
rewarded
,
though
not
to
be
ever
believed
in
any
more
.
 
<EOS>
Dangerfield
,
the
only
other
one
of
that
crew
left
alive
,
was
not
so
fortunate
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
almost
killed
by
a
whipping
from
Newgate
to
Tyburn
,
and
,
as
if
that
were
not
punishment
enough
,
a
ferocious
barrister
of
Gray
's
Inn
gave
him
a
poke
in
the
eye
with
his
cane
,
which
caused
his
death
;
for
which
the
ferocious
barrister
was
deservedly
tried
and
executed
.
  
<EOS>
As
soon
as
James
was
on
the
throne
,
Argyle
and
Monmouth
went
from
Brussels
to
Rotterdam
,
and
attended
a
meeting
of
Scottish
exiles
held
there
,
to
concert
measures
for
a
rising
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
agreed
that
Argyle
should
effect
a
landing
in
Scotland
,
and
Monmouth
in
England
;
and
that
two
Englishmen
should
be
sent
with
Argyle
to
be
in
his
confidence
,
and
two
Scotchmen
with
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
.
  
<EOS>
Argyle
was
the
first
to
act
upon
this
contract
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
two
of
his
men
being
taken
prisoners
at
the
Orkney
Islands
,
the
Government
became
aware
of
his
intention
,
and
was
able
to
act
against
him
with
such
vigour
as
to
prevent
his
raising
more
than
two
or
three
thousand
Highlanders
,
although
he
sent
a
fiery
cross
,
by
trusty
messengers
,
from
clan
to
clan
and
from
glen
to
glen
,
as
the
custom
then
was
when
those
wild
people
were
to
be
excited
by
their
chiefs
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
moving
towards
Glasgow
with
his
small
force
,
he
was
betrayed
by
some
of
his
followers
,
taken
,
and
carried
,
with
his
hands
tied
behind
his
back
,
to
his
old
prison
in
Edinburgh
Castle
.
<EOS>
James
ordered
him
to
be
executed
,
on
his
old
shamefully
unjust
sentence
,
within
three
days
;
and
he
appears
to
have
been
anxious
that
his
legs
should
have
been
pounded
with
his
old
favourite
the
boot
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
the
boot
was
not
applied
;
he
was
simply
beheaded
,
and
his
head
was
set
upon
the
top
of
Edinburgh
Jail
.
 
<EOS>
One
of
those
Englishmen
who
had
been
assigned
to
him
was
that
old
soldier
Rumbold
,
the
master
of
the
Rye
House
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
sorely
wounded
,
and
within
a
week
after
Argyle
had
suffered
with
great
courage
,
was
brought
up
for
trial
,
lest
he
should
die
and
disappoint
the
King
.
<EOS>
He
,
too
,
was
executed
,
after
defending
himself
with
great
spirit
,
and
saying
that
he
did
not
believe
that
God
had
made
the
greater
part
of
mankind
to
carry
saddles
on
their
backs
and
bridles
in
their
mouths
,
and
to
be
ridden
by
a
few
,
booted
and
spurred
for
the
purpose
---
in
which
I
thoroughly
agree
with
Rumbold
.
  
<EOS>
The
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
partly
through
being
detained
and
partly
through
idling
his
time
away
,
was
five
or
six
weeks
behind
his
friend
when
he
landed
at
Lyme
,
in
Dorset
:
 
having
at
his
right
hand
an
unlucky
nobleman
called
LORD
GREY
OF
WERK
,
who
of
himself
would
have
ruined
a
far
more
promising
expedition
.
 
<EOS>
He
immediately
set
up
his
standard
in
the
market
-
place
,
and
proclaimed
the
King
a
tyrant
,
and
a
Popish
usurper
,
and
I
know
not
what
else
;
charging
him
,
not
only
with
what
he
had
done
,
which
was
bad
enough
,
but
with
what
neither
he
nor
anybody
else
had
done
,
such
as
setting
fire
to
London
,
and
poisoning
the
late
King
.
 
<EOS>
Raising
some
four
thousand
men
by
these
means
,
he
marched
on
to
Taunton
,
where
there
were
many
Protestant
dissenters
who
were
strongly
opposed
to
the
Catholics
.
<EOS>
Here
,
both
the
rich
and
poor
turned
out
to
receive
him
,
ladies
waved
a
welcome
to
him
from
all
the
windows
as
he
passed
along
the
streets
,
flowers
were
strewn
in
his
way
,
and
every
compliment
and
honour
that
could
be
devised
was
showered
upon
him
.
 
<EOS>
Among
the
rest
,
twenty
young
ladies
came
forward
,
in
their
best
clothes
,
and
in
their
brightest
beauty
,
and
gave
him
a
Bible
ornamented
with
their
own
fair
hands
,
together
with
other
presents
.
  
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
homage
,
he
proclaimed
himself
King
,
and
went
on
to
Bridgewater
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
here
the
Government
troops
,
under
the
EARL
OF
FEVERSHAM
,
were
close
at
hand
;
and
he
was
so
dispirited
at
finding
that
he
made
but
few
powerful
friends
after
all
,
that
it
was
a
question
whether
he
should
disband
his
army
and
endeavour
to
escape
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
resolved
,
at
the
instance
of
that
unlucky
Lord
Grey
,
to
make
a
night
attack
on
the
King
's
army
,
as
it
lay
encamped
on
the
edge
of
a
morass
called
Sedgemoor
.
 
<EOS>
The
horsemen
were
commanded
by
the
same
unlucky
lord
,
who
was
not
a
brave
man
.
 
<EOS>
He
gave
up
the
battle
almost
at
the
first
obstacle
---
which
was
a
deep
drain
;
and
although
the
poor
countrymen
,
who
had
turned
out
for
Monmouth
,
fought
bravely
with
scythes
,
poles
,
pitchforks
,
and
such
poor
weapons
as
they
had
,
they
were
soon
dispersed
by
the
trained
soldiers
,
and
fled
in
all
directions
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
himself
fled
,
was
not
known
in
the
confusion
;
but
the
unlucky
Lord
Grey
was
taken
early
next
day
,
and
then
another
of
the
party
was
taken
,
who
confessed
that
he
had
parted
from
the
Duke
only
four
hours
before
.
 
<EOS>
Strict
search
being
made
<EOS>
,
he
was
found
disguised
as
a
peasant
,
hidden
in
a
ditch
under
fern
and
nettles
,
with
a
few
peas
in
his
pocket
which
he
had
gathered
in
the
fields
to
eat
.
 
<EOS>
The
only
other
articles
he
had
upon
him
were
a
few
papers
and
little
books
:
 
<EOS>
one
of
the
latter
being
a
strange
jumble
,
in
his
own
writing
,
of
charms
,
songs
,
recipes
,
and
prayers
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
completely
broken
.
 
<EOS>
He
wrote
a
miserable
letter
to
the
King
,
beseeching
and
entreating
to
be
allowed
to
see
him
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
taken
to
London
,
and
conveyed
bound
into
the
King
's
presence
,
he
crawled
to
him
on
his
knees
,
and
made
a
most
degrading
exhibition
.
 
<EOS>
As
James
never
forgave
or
relented
towards
anybody
,
he
was
not
likely
to
soften
towards
the
issuer
of
the
Lyme
proclamation
,
so
he
told
the
suppliant
to
prepare
for
death
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
fifteenth
of
July
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
five
,
this
unfortunate
favourite
of
the
people
was
brought
out
to
die
on
Tower
Hill
.
 
<EOS>
The
crowd
was
immense
,
and
the
tops
of
all
the
houses
were
covered
with
gazers
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
seen
his
wife
,
the
daughter
of
the
Duke
of
Buccleuch
,
in
the
Tower
,
and
had
talked
much
of
a
lady
whom
he
loved
far
better
---
the
LADY
HARRIET
WENTWORTH
---
<EOS>
who
was
one
of
the
last
persons
he
remembered
in
this
life
.
 
<EOS>
Before
laying
down
his
head
upon
the
block
he
felt
the
edge
of
the
axe
,
and
told
the
executioner
that
he
feared
it
was
not
sharp
enough
,
and
that
the
axe
was
not
heavy
enough
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
executioner
replying
that
it
was
of
the
proper
kind
<EOS>
,
the
Duke
said
,
"
I
pray
you
have
a
care
,
and
do
not
use
me
so
awkwardly
as
you
used
my
Lord
Russell
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
executioner
,
made
nervous
by
this
,
and
trembling
,
struck
once
and
merely
gashed
him
in
the
neck
.
 
<EOS>
Upon
this
,
the
Duke
of
Monmouth
raised
his
head
and
looked
the
man
reproachfully
in
the
face
.
 
<EOS>
Then
he
struck
twice
,
and
then
thrice
,
and
then
threw
down
the
axe
,
and
cried
out
in
a
voice
of
horror
that
he
could
not
finish
that
work
.
<EOS>
The
sheriffs
,
however
,
threatening
him
with
what
should
be
done
to
himself
if
he
did
not
,
he
took
it
up
again
and
struck
a
fourth
time
and
a
fifth
time
.
 
<EOS>
Then
the
wretched
head
at
last
fell
off
,
and
James
,
Duke
of
Monmouth
,
was
dead
,
in
the
thirty
-
sixth
year
of
his
age
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
a
showy
,
graceful
man
,
with
many
popular
qualities
,
and
had
found
much
favour
in
the
open
hearts
of
the
English
.
  
<EOS>
The
atrocities
,
committed
by
the
Government
,
which
followed
this
Monmouth
rebellion
,
form
the
blackest
and
most
lamentable
page
in
English
history
.
 
<EOS>
The
poor
peasants
,
having
been
dispersed
with
great
loss
,
and
their
leaders
having
been
taken
,
one
would
think
that
the
implacable
King
might
have
been
satisfied
.
 
<EOS>
But
no
<EOS>
;
he
let
loose
upon
them
,
among
other
intolerable
monsters
,
a
COLONEL
KIRK
,
who
had
served
against
the
Moors
,
and
whose
soldiers
---
called
by
the
people
Kirk
's
lambs
,
because
they
bore
a
lamb
upon
their
flag
,
as
the
emblem
of
Christianity
---
were
worthy
of
their
leader
.
 
<EOS>
The
atrocities
committed
by
these
demons
in
human
shape
are
far
too
horrible
to
be
related
here
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
enough
to
say
,
that
besides
most
ruthlessly
murdering
and
robbing
them
,
and
ruining
them
by
making
them
buy
their
pardons
at
the
price
of
all
they
possessed
,
it
was
one
of
Kirk
's
favourite
amusements
,
as
he
and
his
officers
sat
drinking
after
dinner
,
and
toasting
the
King
,
to
have
batches
of
prisoners
hanged
outside
the
windows
for
the
company
's
diversion
;
and
that
when
their
feet
quivered
in
the
convulsions
of
death
,
he
used
to
swear
that
they
should
have
music
to
their
dancing
,
and
would
order
the
drums
to
beat
and
the
trumpets
to
play
.
 
<EOS>
The
detestable
King
informed
him
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
these
services
,
that
he
was
"
very
well
satisfied
with
his
proceedings
.
"
 
<EOS>
But
the
King
's
great
delight
was
in
the
proceedings
of
Jeffreys
,
now
a
peer
,
who
went
down
into
the
west
,
with
four
other
judges
,
to
try
persons
accused
of
having
had
any
share
in
the
rebellion
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
pleasantly
called
this
"
Jeffreys
's
campaign
.
<EOS>
"
The
people
down
in
that
part
of
the
country
remember
it
to
this
day
as
The
Bloody
Assize
.
  
<EOS>
It
began
at
Winchester
,
where
a
poor
deaf
old
lady
,
MRS
.
<EOS>
ALICIA
LISLE
,
the
widow
of
one
of
the
judges
of
Charles
the
First
(
who
had
been
murdered
abroad
by
some
Royalist
assassins
)
,
was
charged
with
having
given
shelter
in
her
house
to
two
fugitives
from
Sedgemoor
.
<EOS>
Three
times
the
jury
refused
to
find
her
guilty
,
until
Jeffreys
bullied
and
frightened
them
into
that
false
verdict
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
had
extorted
it
from
them
,
he
said
,
"
Gentlemen
,
if
I
had
been
one
of
you
,
and
she
had
been
my
own
mother
,
I
would
have
found
her
guilty
;
"
---
as
I
dare
say
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
He
sentenced
her
to
be
burned
alive
,
that
very
afternoon
.
 
<EOS>
The
clergy
of
the
cathedral
and
some
others
interfered
in
her
favour
,
and
she
was
beheaded
within
a
week
.
 
<EOS>
As
a
high
mark
of
his
approbation
,
the
King
made
Jeffreys
Lord
Chancellor
;
and
he
then
went
on
to
Dorchester
,
to
Exeter
,
to
Taunton
,
and
to
Wells
.
 
<EOS>
It
is
astonishing
,
when
we
read
of
the
enormous
injustice
and
barbarity
of
this
beast
,
to
know
that
no
one
struck
him
dead
on
the
judgment
-
seat
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
enough
for
any
man
or
woman
to
be
accused
by
an
enemy
,
before
Jeffreys
,
to
be
found
guilty
of
high
treason
.
 
<EOS>
One
man
who
pleaded
not
guilty
,
he
ordered
to
be
taken
out
of
court
upon
the
instant
,
and
hanged
;
and
this
so
terrified
the
prisoners
in
general
that
they
mostly
pleaded
guilty
at
once
.
 
<EOS>
At
Dorchester
alone
,
in
the
course
of
a
few
days
,
Jeffreys
hanged
eighty
people
;
besides
whipping
,
transporting
,
imprisoning
,
and
selling
as
slaves
,
great
numbers
.
 
<EOS>
He
executed
,
in
all
,
two
hundred
and
fifty
,
or
three
hundred
.
  
<EOS>
These
executions
took
place
,
among
the
neighbours
and
friends
of
the
sentenced
,
in
thirty
-
six
towns
and
villages
.
 
<EOS>
Their
bodies
were
mangled
,
steeped
in
caldrons
of
boiling
pitch
and
tar
,
and
hung
up
by
the
roadsides
,
in
the
streets
,
over
the
very
churches
.
 
<EOS>
The
sight
and
smell
of
heads
and
limbs
,
the
hissing
and
bubbling
of
the
infernal
caldrons
,
and
the
tears
and
terrors
of
the
people
,
were
dreadful
beyond
all
description
.
 
<EOS>
One
rustic
,
who
was
forced
to
steep
the
remains
in
the
black
pot
,
was
ever
afterwards
called
"
Tom
Boilman
.
"
 
<EOS>
The
hangman
has
ever
since
been
called
Jack
Ketch
,
because
a
man
of
that
name
went
hanging
and
hanging
,
all
day
long
,
in
the
train
of
Jeffreys
.
 
<EOS>
You
will
hear
much
of
the
horrors
of
the
great
French
Revolution
.
 
<EOS>
Many
and
terrible
they
were
,
there
is
no
doubt
;
but
I
know
of
nothing
worse
,
done
by
the
maddened
people
of
France
in
that
awful
time
,
than
was
done
by
the
highest
judge
in
England
,
with
the
express
approval
of
the
King
of
England
,
in
The
Bloody
Assize
.
  
<EOS>
Nor
was
even
this
all
.
 
<EOS>
Jeffreys
was
as
fond
of
money
for
himself
as
of
misery
for
others
,
and
he
sold
pardons
wholesale
to
fill
his
pockets
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
ordered
,
at
one
time
,
a
thousand
prisoners
to
be
given
to
certain
of
his
favourites
,
in
order
that
they
might
bargain
with
them
for
their
pardons
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
ladies
of
Taunton
who
had
presented
the
Bible
,
were
bestowed
upon
the
maids
of
honour
at
court
;
and
those
precious
ladies
made
very
hard
bargains
with
them
indeed
.
 
<EOS>
When
The
Bloody
Assize
was
at
its
most
dismal
height
,
the
King
was
diverting
himself
with
horse
-
races
in
the
very
place
where
Mrs
Lisle
had
been
executed
.
 
<EOS>
When
Jeffreys
had
done
his
worst
,
and
came
home
again
,
he
was
particularly
complimented
in
the
Royal
Gazette
;
and
when
the
King
heard
that
through
drunkenness
and
raging
he
was
very
ill
,
his
odious
Majesty
remarked
that
such
another
man
could
not
easily
be
found
in
England
.
 
<EOS>
Besides
all
this
,
a
former
sheriff
of
London
,
named
CORNISH
,
was
hanged
within
sight
of
his
own
house
,
after
an
abominably
conducted
trial
,
for
having
had
a
share
in
the
Rye
House
Plot
,
on
evidence
given
by
Rumsey
,
which
that
villain
was
obliged
to
confess
was
directly
opposed
to
the
evidence
he
had
given
on
the
trial
of
Lord
Russell
.
<EOS>
And
on
the
very
same
day
,
a
worthy
widow
,
named
ELIZABETH
GAUNT
,
was
burned
alive
at
Tyburn
,
for
having
sheltered
a
wretch
who
himself
gave
evidence
against
her
.
 
<EOS>
She
settled
the
fuel
about
herself
with
her
own
hands
,
so
that
the
flames
should
reach
her
quickly
:
 
and
nobly
said
,
with
her
last
breath
,
that
she
had
obeyed
the
sacred
command
of
God
,
to
give
refuge
to
the
outcast
,
and
not
to
betray
the
wanderer
.
  
<EOS>
After
all
this
hanging
,
beheading
,
burning
,
boiling
,
mutilating
,
exposing
,
robbing
,
transporting
,
and
selling
into
slavery
,
of
his
unhappy
subjects
,
the
King
not
unnaturally
thought
that
he
could
do
whatever
he
would
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
went
to
work
to
change
the
religion
of
the
country
with
all
possible
speed
;
and
what
he
did
was
this
.
  
<EOS>
He
first
of
all
tried
to
get
rid
of
what
was
called
the
Test
Act
---
which
prevented
the
Catholics
from
holding
public
employments
---
by
his
own
power
of
dispensing
with
the
penalties
.
 
<EOS>
He
tried
it
in
one
case
,
and
,
eleven
of
the
twelve
judges
deciding
in
his
favour
,
he
exercised
it
in
three
others
,
being
those
of
three
dignitaries
of
University
College
,
Oxford
,
who
had
become
Papists
,
and
whom
he
kept
in
their
places
and
sanctioned
.
 
<EOS>
He
revived
the
hated
Ecclesiastical
Commission
,
to
get
rid
of
COMPTON
,
Bishop
of
London
,
who
manfully
opposed
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
solicited
the
Pope
to
favour
England
with
an
ambassador
,
which
the
Pope
(
who
was
a
sensible
man
then
)
rather
unwillingly
did
.
 
<EOS>
He
flourished
Father
Petre
before
the
eyes
of
the
people
on
all
possible
occasions
.
 
<EOS>
He
favoured
the
establishment
of
convents
in
several
parts
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
delighted
to
have
the
streets
,
and
even
the
court
itself
,
filled
with
Monks
and
Friars
in
the
habits
of
their
orders
.
 
<EOS>
He
constantly
endeavoured
to
make
Catholics
of
the
Protestants
about
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
held
private
interviews
,
which
he
called
"
closetings
,
"
with
those
Members
of
Parliament
who
held
offices
,
to
persuade
them
to
consent
to
the
design
he
had
in
view
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
did
not
consent
,
they
were
removed
,
or
resigned
of
themselves
,
and
their
places
were
given
to
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
He
displaced
Protestant
officers
from
the
army
,
by
every
means
in
his
power
,
and
got
Catholics
into
their
places
too
.
<EOS>
He
tried
the
same
thing
with
the
corporations
,
and
also
(
though
not
so
successfully
)
with
the
Lord
Lieutenants
of
counties
.
 
<EOS>
To
terrify
the
people
into
the
endurance
of
all
these
measures
,
he
kept
an
army
of
fifteen
thousand
men
encamped
on
Hounslow
Heath
,
where
mass
was
openly
performed
in
the
General
's
tent
,
and
where
priests
went
among
the
soldiers
endeavouring
to
persuade
them
to
become
Catholics
.
 
<EOS>
For
circulating
a
paper
among
those
men
advising
them
to
be
true
to
their
religion
,
a
Protestant
clergyman
,
named
JOHNSON
,
the
chaplain
of
the
late
Lord
Russell
,
was
actually
sentenced
to
stand
three
times
in
the
pillory
,
and
was
actually
whipped
from
Newgate
to
Tyburn
.
 
<EOS>
He
dismissed
his
own
brother
-
in
-
law
from
his
Council
because
he
was
a
Protestant
,
and
made
a
Privy
Councillor
of
the
before
-
mentioned
Father
Petre
.
 
<EOS>
He
handed
Ireland
over
to
RICHARD
TALBOT
,
EARL
OF
TYRCONNELL
,
a
worthless
,
dissolute
knave
,
who
played
the
same
game
there
for
his
master
,
and
who
played
the
deeper
game
for
himself
of
one
day
putting
it
under
the
protection
of
the
French
King
.
 
<EOS>
In
going
to
these
extremities
,
every
man
of
sense
and
judgment
among
the
Catholics
,
from
the
Pope
to
a
porter
,
knew
that
the
King
was
a
mere
bigoted
fool
,
who
would
undo
himself
and
the
cause
he
sought
to
advance
;
but
he
was
deaf
to
all
reason
,
and
,
happily
for
England
ever
afterwards
,
went
tumbling
off
his
throne
in
his
own
blind
way
.
  
<EOS>
A
spirit
began
to
arise
in
the
country
,
which
the
besotted
blunderer
little
expected
.
 
<EOS>
He
first
found
it
out
in
the
University
of
Cambridge
.
 
<EOS>
Having
made
a
Catholic
a
dean
at
Oxford
without
any
opposition
,
he
tried
to
make
a
monk
a
master
of
arts
at
Cambridge
:
which
attempt
the
University
resisted
,
and
defeated
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
then
went
back
to
his
favourite
Oxford
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
death
of
the
President
of
Magdalen
College
,
he
commanded
that
there
should
be
elected
to
succeed
him
,
one
MR
.
<EOS>
ANTHONY
FARMER
,
whose
only
recommendation
was
,
that
he
was
of
the
King
's
religion
.
 
<EOS>
The
University
plucked
up
courage
at
last
,
and
refused
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
substituted
another
man
,
and
it
still
refused
,
resolving
to
stand
by
its
own
election
of
a
MR
.
HOUGH
.
 
<EOS>
The
dull
tyrant
,
upon
this
,
punished
Mr
Hough
,
and
five
-
and
-
twenty
more
,
by
causing
them
to
be
expelled
and
declared
incapable
of
holding
any
church
preferment
;
then
he
proceeded
to
what
he
supposed
to
be
his
highest
step
,
but
to
what
was
,
in
fact
,
his
last
plunge
head
-
foremost
in
his
tumble
off
his
throne
.
  
<EOS>
He
had
issued
a
declaration
that
there
should
be
no
religious
tests
or
penal
laws
,
in
order
to
let
in
the
Catholics
more
easily
;
but
the
Protestant
dissenters
,
unmindful
of
themselves
,
had
gallantly
joined
the
regular
church
in
opposing
it
tooth
and
nail
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
and
Father
Petre
now
resolved
to
have
this
read
,
on
a
certain
Sunday
,
in
all
the
churches
,
and
to
order
it
to
be
circulated
for
that
purpose
by
the
bishops
.
 
<EOS>
The
latter
took
counsel
with
the
Archbishop
of
Canterbury
,
who
was
in
disgrace
;
and
they
resolved
that
the
declaration
should
not
be
read
,
and
that
they
would
petition
the
King
against
it
.
 
<EOS>
The
Archbishop
himself
wrote
out
the
petition
,
and
six
bishops
went
into
the
King
's
bedchamber
the
same
night
to
present
it
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
.
 
<EOS>
Next
day
was
the
Sunday
fixed
for
the
reading
,
and
it
was
only
read
by
two
hundred
clergymen
out
of
ten
thousand
.
 
<EOS>
The
King
resolved
against
all
advice
to
prosecute
the
bishops
in
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
,
and
within
three
weeks
they
were
summoned
before
the
Privy
Council
,
and
committed
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
As
the
six
bishops
were
taken
to
that
dismal
place
,
by
water
,
the
people
who
were
assembled
in
immense
numbers
fell
upon
their
knees
,
and
wept
for
them
,
and
prayed
for
them
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
got
to
the
Tower
,
the
officers
and
soldiers
on
guard
besought
them
for
their
blessing
.
 
<EOS>
While
they
were
confined
there
,
the
soldiers
every
day
drank
to
their
release
with
loud
shouts
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
were
brought
up
to
the
Court
of
King
's
Bench
for
their
trial
,
which
the
Attorney
-
General
said
was
for
the
high
offence
of
censuring
the
Government
,
and
giving
their
opinion
about
affairs
of
state
,
they
were
attended
by
similar
multitudes
,
and
surrounded
by
a
throng
of
noblemen
and
gentlemen
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
jury
went
out
at
seven
o'clock
at
night
to
consider
of
their
verdict
,
everybody
(
except
the
King
)
knew
that
they
would
rather
starve
than
yield
to
the
King
's
brewer
,
who
was
one
of
them
,
and
wanted
a
verdict
for
his
customer
.
 
<EOS>
When
they
came
into
court
next
morning
,
after
resisting
the
brewer
all
night
,
and
gave
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
,
such
a
shout
rose
up
in
Westminster
Hall
as
it
had
never
heard
before
;
and
it
was
passed
on
among
the
people
away
to
Temple
Bar
,
and
away
again
to
the
Tower
.
 
<EOS>
It
did
not
pass
only
to
the
east
,
but
passed
to
the
west
too
,
until
it
reached
the
camp
at
Hounslow
,
where
the
fifteen
thousand
soldiers
took
it
up
and
echoed
it
.
 
<EOS>
And
still
,
when
the
dull
King
,
who
was
then
with
Lord
Feversham
,
heard
the
mighty
roar
,
asked
in
alarm
what
it
was
,
and
was
told
that
it
was
"
nothing
but
the
acquittal
of
the
bishops
,
"
he
said
,
in
his
dogged
way
,
"
Call
you
that
nothing
?
 
<EOS>
It
is
so
much
the
worse
for
them
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Between
the
petition
and
the
trial
,
the
Queen
had
given
birth
to
a
son
,
which
Father
Petre
rather
thought
was
owing
to
Saint
Winifred
.
<EOS>
But
I
doubt
if
Saint
Winifred
had
much
to
do
with
it
as
the
King
's
friend
,
inasmuch
as
the
entirely
new
prospect
of
a
Catholic
successor
(
for
both
the
King
's
daughters
were
Protestants
)
determined
the
EARLS
OF
SHREWSBURY
,
DANBY
,
and
DEVONSHIRE
,
LORD
LUMLEY
,
the
BISHOP
OF
LONDON
,
ADMIRAL
RUSSELL
,
and
COLONEL
SIDNEY
,
to
invite
the
Prince
of
Orange
over
to
England
.
 
<EOS>
The
Royal
Mole
,
seeing
his
danger
at
last
,
made
,
in
his
fright
,
many
great
concessions
,
besides
raising
an
army
of
forty
thousand
men
;
but
the
Prince
of
Orange
was
not
a
man
for
James
the
Second
to
cope
with
.
<EOS>
His
preparations
were
extraordinarily
vigorous
,
and
his
mind
was
resolved
.
  
<EOS>
For
a
fortnight
after
the
Prince
was
ready
to
sail
for
England
,
<EOS>
a
great
wind
from
the
west
prevented
the
departure
of
his
fleet
.
<EOS>
Even
when
the
wind
lulled
,
and
it
did
sail
,
it
was
dispersed
by
a
storm
,
and
was
obliged
to
put
back
to
refit
.
 
<EOS>
At
last
,
on
the
first
of
November
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
,
the
Protestant
east
wind
,
as
it
was
long
called
,
began
to
blow
;
and
on
the
third
,
the
people
of
Dover
and
the
people
of
Calais
saw
a
fleet
twenty
miles
long
sailing
gallantly
by
,
between
the
two
places
.
 
<EOS>
On
Monday
,
the
fifth
,
it
anchored
at
Torbay
in
Devonshire
,
and
the
Prince
,
with
a
splendid
retinue
of
officers
and
men
,
marched
into
Exeter
.
 
<EOS>
But
the
people
in
that
western
part
of
the
country
had
suffered
so
much
in
The
Bloody
Assize
,
that
they
had
lost
heart
.
<EOS>
Few
people
joined
him
;
and
he
began
to
think
of
returning
,
and
publishing
the
invitation
he
had
received
from
those
lords
,
as
his
justification
for
having
come
at
all
.
 
<EOS>
At
this
crisis
,
some
of
the
gentry
joined
him
;
the
Royal
army
began
to
falter
;
an
engagement
was
signed
,
by
which
all
who
set
their
hand
to
it
declared
that
they
would
support
one
another
in
defence
of
the
laws
and
liberties
of
the
three
Kingdoms
,
of
the
Protestant
religion
,
and
of
the
Prince
of
Orange
.
 
<EOS>
From
that
time
,
the
cause
received
no
check
;
the
greatest
towns
in
England
began
,
one
after
another
,
to
declare
for
the
Prince
;
and
he
knew
that
it
was
all
safe
with
him
when
the
University
of
Oxford
offered
to
melt
down
its
plate
,
if
he
wanted
any
money
.
  
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
King
was
running
about
in
a
pitiable
way
,
touching
people
for
the
King
's
evil
in
one
place
,
reviewing
his
troops
in
another
,
and
bleeding
from
the
nose
in
a
third
.
 
<EOS>
The
young
Prince
was
sent
to
Portsmouth
,
Father
Petre
went
off
like
a
shot
to
France
,
and
there
was
a
general
and
swift
dispersal
of
all
the
priests
and
friars
.
 
<EOS>
One
after
another
,
the
King
's
most
important
officers
and
friends
deserted
him
and
went
over
to
the
Prince
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
night
,
his
daughter
Anne
fled
from
Whitehall
Palace
;
and
the
Bishop
of
London
,
who
had
once
been
a
soldier
,
rode
before
her
with
a
drawn
sword
in
his
hand
,
and
pistols
at
his
saddle
.
 
<EOS>
"
God
help
me
,
"
cried
the
miserable
King
:
 
<EOS>
"
my
very
children
have
forsaken
me
!
"
 
<EOS>
In
his
wildness
,
after
debating
with
such
lords
as
were
in
London
,
whether
he
should
or
should
not
call
a
Parliament
,
and
after
naming
three
of
them
to
negotiate
with
the
Prince
,
he
resolved
to
fly
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
He
had
the
little
Prince
of
Wales
brought
back
from
Portsmouth
;
and
the
child
and
the
Queen
crossed
the
river
to
Lambeth
in
an
open
boat
,
on
a
miserable
wet
night
,
and
got
safely
away
.
 
<EOS>
This
was
on
the
night
of
the
ninth
of
December
.
  
<EOS>
At
one
o'clock
on
the
morning
of
the
eleventh
,
the
King
,
who
had
,
in
the
meantime
,
received
a
letter
from
the
Prince
of
Orange
,
stating
his
objects
,
got
out
of
bed
,
told
LORD
NORTHUMBERLAND
who
lay
in
his
room
not
to
open
the
door
until
the
usual
hour
in
the
morning
,
and
went
down
the
back
stairs
(
the
same
,
I
suppose
,
by
which
the
priest
in
the
wig
and
gown
had
come
up
to
his
brother
)
and
crossed
the
river
in
a
small
boat
:
 
sinking
the
great
seal
of
England
by
the
way
.
 
<EOS>
Horses
having
been
provided
,
he
rode
,
accompanied
by
SIR
EDWARD
HALES
,
to
Feversham
,
where
he
embarked
in
a
Custom
House
Hoy
.
 
<EOS>
The
master
of
this
Hoy
,
wanting
more
ballast
,
ran
into
the
Isle
of
Sheppy
to
get
it
,
where
the
fishermen
and
smugglers
crowded
about
the
boat
,
and
informed
the
King
of
their
suspicions
that
he
was
a
"
hatchet
-
faced
Jesuit
.
"
 
<EOS>
As
they
took
his
money
and
would
not
let
him
go
,
he
told
them
who
he
was
,
and
that
the
Prince
of
Orange
wanted
to
take
his
life
;
and
he
began
to
scream
for
a
boat
---
and
then
to
cry
,
because
he
had
lost
a
piece
of
wood
on
his
ride
which
he
called
a
fragment
of
Our
Saviour
's
cross
.
<EOS>
He
put
himself
into
the
hands
of
the
Lord
Lieutenant
of
the
county
,
and
his
detention
was
made
known
to
the
Prince
of
Orange
at
Windsor
---
who
,
only
wanting
to
get
rid
of
him
,
and
not
caring
where
he
went
,
so
that
he
went
away
,
was
very
much
disconcerted
that
they
did
not
let
him
go
.
 
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
have
him
brought
back
,
with
some
state
in
the
way
of
Life
Guards
,
to
Whitehall
.
 
<EOS>
And
as
soon
as
he
got
there
,
in
his
infatuation
,
he
heard
mass
,
and
set
a
Jesuit
to
say
grace
at
his
public
dinner
.
  
<EOS>
The
people
had
been
thrown
into
the
strangest
state
of
confusion
by
his
flight
,
and
had
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
the
Irish
part
of
the
army
were
going
to
murder
the
Protestants
.
 
<EOS>
Therefore
,
they
set
the
bells
a
ringing
,
and
lighted
watch
-
fires
,
and
burned
Catholic
Chapels
,
and
looked
about
in
all
directions
for
Father
Petre
and
the
Jesuits
,
while
the
Pope
's
ambassador
was
running
away
in
the
dress
of
a
footman
.
 
<EOS>
They
found
no
Jesuits
;
but
a
man
,
who
had
once
been
a
frightened
witness
before
Jeffreys
in
court
,
saw
a
swollen
,
drunken
face
looking
through
a
window
down
at
Wapping
,
which
he
well
remembered
.
 
<EOS>
The
face
was
in
a
sailor
's
dress
,
but
he
knew
it
to
be
the
face
of
that
accursed
judge
,
and
he
seized
him
.
<EOS>
The
people
,
to
their
lasting
honour
,
did
not
tear
him
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
After
knocking
him
about
a
little
,
they
took
him
,
in
the
basest
agonies
of
terror
,
to
the
Lord
Mayor
,
who
sent
him
,
at
his
own
shrieking
petition
,
to
the
Tower
for
safety
.
 
<EOS>
There
,
he
died
.
  
<EOS>
Their
bewilderment
continuing
,
the
people
now
lighted
bonfires
and
made
rejoicings
,
as
if
they
had
any
reason
to
be
glad
to
have
the
King
back
again
.
 
<EOS>
But
,
his
stay
was
very
short
,
for
the
English
guards
were
removed
from
Whitehall
<EOS>
,
Dutch
guards
were
marched
up
to
it
,
and
he
was
told
by
one
of
his
late
ministers
that
the
Prince
would
enter
London
,
next
day
,
and
he
had
better
go
to
Ham
.
 
<EOS>
He
said
,
Ham
was
a
cold
,
damp
place
,
and
he
would
rather
go
to
Rochester
.
 
<EOS>
He
thought
himself
very
cunning
in
this
,
as
he
meant
to
escape
from
Rochester
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
The
Prince
of
Orange
and
his
friends
knew
that
,
perfectly
well
,
and
desired
nothing
more
.
 
<EOS>
So
,
he
went
to
Gravesend
,
in
his
royal
barge
,
attended
by
certain
lords
,
and
watched
by
Dutch
troops
,
and
pitied
by
the
generous
people
,
who
were
far
more
forgiving
than
he
had
ever
been
,
when
they
saw
him
in
his
humiliation
.
 
<EOS>
On
the
night
of
the
twenty
-
third
of
December
,
not
even
then
understanding
that
everybody
wanted
to
get
rid
of
him
,
he
went
out
,
absurdly
,
through
his
Rochester
garden
,
down
to
the
Medway
,
and
got
away
to
France
,
where
he
rejoined
the
Queen
.
  
<EOS>
There
had
been
a
council
in
his
absence
,
of
the
lords
,
and
the
authorities
of
London
.
 
<EOS>
When
the
Prince
came
,
on
the
day
after
the
King
's
departure
,
he
summoned
the
Lords
to
meet
him
,
and
soon
afterwards
,
all
those
who
had
served
in
any
of
the
Parliaments
of
King
Charles
the
Second
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
finally
resolved
by
these
authorities
that
the
throne
was
vacant
by
the
conduct
of
King
James
the
Second
;
that
it
was
inconsistent
with
the
safety
and
welfare
of
this
Protestant
kingdom
,
to
be
governed
by
a
Popish
prince
;
that
the
Prince
and
Princess
of
Orange
should
be
King
and
Queen
during
their
lives
and
the
life
of
the
survivor
of
them
;
and
that
their
children
should
succeed
them
,
if
they
had
any
.
 
<EOS>
That
if
they
had
none
,
the
Princess
Anne
and
her
children
should
succeed
;
that
if
she
had
none
,
the
heirs
of
the
Prince
of
Orange
should
succeed
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
thirteenth
of
January
,
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
nine
,
the
Prince
and
Princess
,
sitting
on
a
throne
in
Whitehall
,
bound
themselves
to
these
conditions
.
 
<EOS>
The
Protestant
religion
was
established
in
England
,
and
England
's
great
and
glorious
Revolution
was
complete
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXXVII
    
<EOS>
I
HAVE
now
arrived
at
the
close
of
my
little
history
.
 
<EOS>
The
events
which
succeeded
the
famous
Revolution
of
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
-
eight
,
would
neither
be
easily
related
nor
easily
understood
in
such
a
book
as
this
.
  
<EOS>
William
and
Mary
reigned
together
,
five
years
.
 
<EOS>
After
the
death
of
his
good
wife
,
William
occupied
the
throne
,
alone
,
for
seven
years
longer
.
 
<EOS>
During
his
reign
,
on
the
sixteenth
of
September
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
one
,
the
poor
weak
creature
who
had
once
been
James
the
Second
of
England
,
died
in
France
.
 
<EOS>
In
the
meantime
he
had
done
his
utmost
(
which
was
not
much
)
to
cause
William
to
be
assassinated
,
and
to
regain
his
lost
dominions
.
 
<EOS>
James
's
son
was
declared
,
by
the
French
King
,
the
rightful
King
of
England
;
and
was
called
in
France
THE
CHEVALIER
SAINT
GEORGE
,
and
in
England
THE
PRETENDER
.
 
<EOS>
Some
infatuated
people
in
England
,
and
particularly
in
Scotland
,
took
up
the
Pretender
's
cause
from
time
to
time
---
as
if
the
country
had
not
had
Stuarts
enough
!
---
and
many
lives
were
sacrificed
,
and
much
misery
was
occasioned
.
 
<EOS>
King
William
died
on
Sunday
,
the
seventh
of
March
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
two
,
of
the
consequences
of
an
accident
occasioned
by
his
horse
stumbling
with
him
.
 
<EOS>
He
was
always
a
brave
,
patriotic
Prince
,
and
a
man
of
remarkable
abilities
.
 
<EOS>
His
manner
was
cold
,
and
he
made
but
few
friends
;
but
he
had
truly
loved
his
queen
.
 
<EOS>
When
he
was
dead
,
a
lock
of
her
hair
,
in
a
ring
,
was
found
tied
with
a
black
ribbon
round
his
left
arm
.
  
<EOS>
He
was
succeeded
by
the
PRINCESS
ANNE
,
a
popular
Queen
,
who
reigned
twelve
years
.
 
<EOS>
In
her
reign
,
in
the
month
of
May
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
seven
,
the
Union
between
England
and
Scotland
was
effected
,
and
the
two
countries
were
incorporated
under
the
name
of
GREAT
BRITAIN
.
 
<EOS>
Then
,
from
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
fourteen
to
the
year
one
thousand
,
eight
hundred
and
thirty
,
reigned
the
four
GEORGES
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
reign
of
George
the
Second
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
forty
-
five
,
that
the
Pretender
did
his
last
mischief
,
and
made
his
last
appearance
.
 
<EOS>
Being
an
old
man
by
that
time
,
he
and
the
Jacobites
---
as
his
friends
were
called
---
put
forward
his
son
,
CHARLES
EDWARD
,
known
as
the
young
Chevalier
.
 
<EOS>
The
Highlanders
of
Scotland
,
an
extremely
troublesome
and
wrong
-
headed
race
on
the
subject
of
the
Stuarts
,
espoused
his
cause
,
and
he
joined
them
,
and
there
was
a
Scottish
rebellion
to
make
him
king
,
in
which
many
gallant
and
devoted
gentlemen
lost
their
lives
.
 
<EOS>
It
was
a
hard
matter
for
Charles
Edward
to
escape
abroad
again
,
with
a
high
price
on
his
head
;
but
the
Scottish
people
were
extraordinarily
faithful
to
him
,
and
,
after
undergoing
many
romantic
adventures
,
not
unlike
those
of
Charles
the
Second
,
he
escaped
to
France
.
 
<EOS>
A
number
of
charming
stories
and
delightful
songs
arose
out
of
the
Jacobite
feelings
,
and
belong
to
the
Jacobite
times
.
 
<EOS>
Otherwise
I
think
the
Stuarts
were
a
public
nuisance
altogether
.
  
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
reign
of
George
the
Third
that
England
lost
North
America
,
by
persisting
in
taxing
her
without
her
own
consent
.
 
<EOS>
That
immense
country
,
made
independent
under
WASHINGTON
,
and
left
to
itself
,
became
the
United
States
;
one
of
the
greatest
nations
of
the
earth
.
 
<EOS>
In
these
times
in
which
I
write
,
it
is
honourably
remarkable
for
protecting
its
subjects
,
wherever
they
may
travel
,
with
a
dignity
and
a
determination
which
is
a
model
for
England
.
<EOS>
Between
you
and
me
,
England
has
rather
lost
ground
in
this
respect
since
the
days
of
Oliver
Cromwell
.
  
<EOS>
The
Union
of
Great
Britain
with
Ireland
---
which
had
been
getting
on
very
ill
by
itself
---
took
place
in
the
reign
of
George
the
Third
,
on
the
second
of
July
,
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
-
eight
.
  
<EOS>
WILLIAM
THE
FOURTH
succeeded
George
the
Fourth
,
in
the
year
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
,
and
reigned
seven
years
.
 
<EOS>
QUEEN
VICTORIA
,
his
niece
,
the
only
child
of
the
Duke
of
Kent
,
the
fourth
son
of
George
the
Third
,
came
to
the
throne
on
the
twentieth
of
June
,
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty
-
seven
.
 
<EOS>
She
was
married
to
PRINCE
ALBERT
of
Saxe
Gotha
on
the
tenth
of
February
,
one
thousand
eight
hundred
and
forty
.
 
<EOS>
She
is
very
good
,
and
much
beloved
.
 
<EOS>
So
I
end
,
like
the
crier
,
with
  
GOD
SAVE
THE
QUEEN
!
