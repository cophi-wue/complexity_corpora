Chapter
I
An
account
of
Mr
Gamaliel
Pickle
.
<EOS>
The
disposition
of
his
sister
described
.
<EOS>
He
yields
to
her
sollicitations
,
and
retires
to
the
country
.
  
<EOS>
In
a
certain
county
of
England
,
bounded
on
one
side
by
the
sea
,
and
at
the
distance
of
one
hundred
miles
from
the
metropolis
,
lived
Gamaliel
Pickle
Esq
;
the
father
of
that
hero
whose
adventures
we
propose
to
record
.
<EOS>
He
was
the
son
of
a
merchant
in
London
,
who
(
like
Rome
)
from
small
beginnings
,
had
raised
himself
to
the
highest
honours
of
the
city
,
and
acquired
a
plentiful
fortune
,
tho
'
,
to
his
infinite
regret
,
he
died
before
it
amounted
to
a
Plum
,
conjuring
his
son
,
as
he
respected
the
last
injunction
of
a
parent
,
to
imitate
his
industry
and
adhere
to
his
maxims
,
until
he
should
have
made
up
the
deficiency
,
which
was
a
sum
considerably
less
than
fifteen
thousand
pounds
.
    
<EOS>
This
pathetic
remonstrance
had
the
desired
effect
upon
his
representative
,
who
spared
no
pains
to
fulfil
the
request
of
the
deceased
;
but
exerted
all
the
capacity
with
which
nature
had
endowed
him
,
in
a
series
of
efforts
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
succeed
;
for
,
by
that
time
he
had
been
fifteen
years
in
trade
,
he
found
himself
five
thousand
pounds
worse
than
he
was
when
he
first
took
possession
of
his
father
's
effects
:
a
circumstance
that
affected
him
so
nearly
,
as
to
detach
his
inclinations
from
business
,
and
induce
him
to
retire
from
the
world
,
to
some
place
where
he
might
at
leisure
deplore
his
misfortunes
,
and
,
by
frugality
,
secure
himself
from
want
,
and
the
apprehensions
of
a
jail
,
with
which
his
imagination
was
incessantly
haunted
.
<EOS>
He
was
often
heard
to
express
his
fears
of
coming
upon
the
parish
;
and
to
bless
God
,
that
,
on
account
of
his
having
been
so
long
a
housekeeper
,
he
was
intitled
to
that
provision
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
his
talents
were
not
naturally
active
,
and
there
was
a
sort
of
inconsistency
in
his
character
;
for
,
with
all
the
desire
of
amassing
which
any
citizen
could
possibly
entertain
,
he
was
encumbered
by
a
certain
indolence
and
sluggishness
that
prevailed
over
every
interested
consideration
,
and
even
hindered
him
from
profiting
by
that
singleness
of
apprehension
,
and
moderation
of
appetites
,
which
have
so
frequently
conduced
to
the
acquisition
of
immense
fortunes
,
and
which
he
possessed
in
a
very
remarkable
degree
.
<EOS>
Nature
,
in
all
probability
,
had
mixed
little
or
nothing
inflammable
in
his
composition
;
or
,
whatever
seeds
of
excess
she
might
have
sown
within
him
,
were
effectually
stifled
and
destroyed
by
the
austerity
of
his
education
.
    
<EOS>
The
sallies
of
his
youth
,
far
from
being
inordinate
or
criminal
,
never
exceeded
the
bounds
of
that
decent
jollity
which
an
extraordinary
pot
,
on
extraordinary
occasions
,
may
be
supposed
to
have
produced
in
a
club
of
sedate
book
-
keepers
,
whose
imaginations
were
neither
very
warm
nor
luxuriant
.
<EOS>
Little
subject
to
refined
sensations
,
he
was
scarce
ever
disturbed
with
violent
emotions
of
any
kind
.
<EOS>
The
passion
of
love
never
interrupted
his
tranquillity
;
and
if
,
as
Mr
Creech
says
after
Horace
,
    
Not
to
admire
is
all
the
art
,
I
know
;
  
To
make
men
happy
,
and
to
keep
them
so
;
    
Mr
Pickle
was
undoubtedly
possessed
of
that
invaluable
secret
;
at
least
,
he
was
never
known
to
betray
the
faintest
symptom
of
transport
,
except
one
evening
at
the
club
,
where
he
observed
,
with
some
demonstrations
of
vivacity
,
that
he
had
dined
upon
a
delicate
loin
of
veal
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
appearance
of
phlegm
,
he
could
not
help
feeling
his
disappointments
in
trade
;
and
upon
the
failure
of
a
certain
underwriter
,
by
which
he
lost
five
hundred
pounds
,
declared
his
design
of
relinquishing
business
,
and
retiring
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
In
this
resolution
he
was
comforted
and
encouraged
by
his
only
sister
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
had
managed
his
family
,
since
the
death
of
his
father
,
and
was
now
in
the
thirtieth
year
of
her
maidenhood
,
with
a
fortune
of
five
thousand
pounds
,
and
a
large
stock
of
oeconomy
and
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
These
qualifications
,
one
would
think
,
might
have
been
the
means
of
abridging
the
term
of
her
celibacy
,
as
she
never
expressed
any
aversion
for
wedlock
;
but
,
it
seems
,
she
was
too
delicate
in
her
choice
,
to
find
a
mate
to
her
inclination
in
the
city
:
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
suppose
that
she
remained
so
long
unsollicited
;
tho
'
the
charms
of
her
person
were
not
altogether
enchanting
,
nor
her
manner
over
and
above
agreeable
.
<EOS>
Exclusive
of
a
very
wan
<EOS>
(
not
to
call
it
a
sallow
)
complexion
,
which
perhaps
was
the
effect
of
her
virginity
and
mortification
,
she
had
a
cast
in
her
eyes
that
was
not
at
all
engaging
,
and
such
an
extent
of
mouth
,
as
no
art
or
affectation
could
contract
into
any
proportionable
dimension
:
then
her
piety
was
rather
peevish
than
resigned
,
and
did
not
in
the
least
diminish
a
certain
stateliness
in
her
demeanour
and
conversation
,
that
delighted
in
communicating
the
importance
and
honour
of
her
family
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
was
not
to
be
traced
two
generations
back
,
by
all
the
power
of
heraldry
or
tradition
.
    
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
have
renounced
all
the
ideas
she
had
acquired
before
her
father
served
the
office
of
sheriff
;
and
the
aera
which
regulated
the
dates
of
all
her
observations
,
was
the
mayoralty
of
her
papa
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
sollicitous
was
this
good
lady
for
the
support
and
propagation
of
the
family
-
name
,
that
,
suppressing
every
selfish
motive
,
she
actually
prevailed
upon
her
brother
to
combat
his
own
disposition
,
and
even
surmount
it
so
far
,
as
to
declare
a
passion
for
the
person
whom
he
afterwards
wedded
,
as
we
shall
see
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
was
the
spur
that
instigated
him
in
all
his
extraordinary
undertakings
;
and
I
question
whether
or
not
he
would
have
been
able
to
disengage
himself
from
that
course
of
life
in
which
he
had
so
long
mechanically
moved
,
unless
he
had
been
roused
and
actuated
by
her
incessant
exhortations
.
    
<EOS>
London
,
she
observed
,
was
a
receptacle
of
iniquity
,
where
an
honest
unsuspecting
man
was
every
day
in
danger
of
falling
a
sacrifice
to
craft
;
where
innocence
was
exposed
to
continual
temptations
,
and
virtue
eternally
persecuted
by
malice
and
slander
;
where
every
thing
was
ruled
by
caprice
and
corruption
,
and
merit
utterly
discouraged
and
despised
.
<EOS>
This
last
imputation
she
pronounced
with
such
emphasis
and
chagrin
,
as
plainly
denoted
how
far
she
considered
herself
an
example
of
what
she
advanced
;
and
really
,
the
charge
was
justified
by
the
constructions
that
were
put
upon
her
retreat
by
her
female
friends
,
who
,
far
from
imputing
it
to
the
laudable
motives
that
induced
her
,
insinuated
,
in
sarcastic
commendations
,
that
she
had
good
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
a
place
where
she
had
been
so
long
overlooked
;
and
that
it
was
certainly
her
wisest
course
to
make
her
last
effort
in
the
country
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
her
talents
would
be
less
eclipsed
,
and
her
fortune
more
attractive
.
    
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
will
,
her
admonitions
<EOS>
,
tho
'
they
were
powerful
enough
to
convince
,
would
have
been
insufficient
to
overcome
the
languor
and
vis
inertiae
of
her
brother
,
had
she
not
reinforced
her
arguments
,
by
calling
in
question
the
credit
of
two
or
three
merchants
,
with
whom
he
was
embarked
in
trade
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
these
hints
of
intelligence
,
he
exerted
himself
effectually
;
and
having
withdrawn
his
money
,
which
he
had
laid
out
in
Bank
stock
and
India
bonds
,
removed
to
a
house
in
the
country
,
that
his
father
had
built
near
the
sea
-
side
,
for
the
convenience
of
carrying
on
a
certain
branch
of
traffick
in
which
he
had
been
deeply
concerned
.
    
<EOS>
Here
then
Mr
Pickle
fixed
his
habitation
for
life
,
in
the
six
-
and
-
thirtieth
year
of
his
age
;
and
tho
'
the
pangs
he
felt
at
parting
with
his
intimate
companions
,
and
quitting
all
his
former
connexions
,
were
not
quite
so
keen
as
to
produce
any
dangerous
disorder
in
his
constitution
,
he
did
not
fail
to
be
extremely
disconcerted
at
his
first
entrance
into
a
scene
of
life
to
which
he
was
totally
a
stranger
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
he
met
with
abundance
of
people
in
the
country
,
who
,
in
consideration
of
his
fortune
,
courted
his
acquaintance
,
and
breathed
nothing
but
friendship
and
hospitality
:
yet
even
the
trouble
of
receiving
and
returning
these
civilities
,
was
an
intolerable
fatigue
to
a
man
of
his
habits
and
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
left
the
care
of
the
ceremonial
to
his
sister
,
who
indulged
herself
in
all
the
pride
of
formality
,
while
he
himself
,
having
made
a
discovery
of
a
public
house
in
the
neighbourhood
,
went
thither
every
evening
,
and
enjoyed
his
pipe
and
cann
;
being
very
well
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
the
landlord
,
whose
communicative
temper
was
a
great
comfort
to
his
own
taciturnity
;
for
he
shunned
all
superfluity
of
speech
,
as
much
as
he
avoided
any
other
unnecessary
expence
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
II
<EOS>
He
is
made
acquainted
with
the
characters
of
Commodore
Trunnion
and
his
adherents
;
meets
with
them
by
accident
,
and
contracts
an
intimacy
with
that
commander
.
  
<EOS>
This
loquacious
publican
soon
gave
him
sketches
of
all
the
characters
in
the
county
;
and
,
among
others
,
described
that
of
his
next
neighbour
Commodore
Trunnion
,
which
was
altogether
singular
and
odd
.
    
<EOS>
"
The
commodore
and
your
worship
(
said
he
)
will
in
a
short
time
be
hand
and
glove
;
he
has
a
power
of
money
,
and
spends
like
a
prince
 
that
is
,
in
his
own
way
  
for
to
be
sure
he
is
a
little
humoursome
,
as
the
saying
is
,
and
swears
woundily
;
tho
'
I
'll
be
sworn
<EOS>
he
means
no
more
harm
than
a
sucking
babe
.
<EOS>
Lord
help
us
!
<EOS>
it
will
do
your
honour
's
heart
good
to
hear
him
tell
a
story
,
as
how
he
lay
along
-
side
of
the
French
,
yard
-
arm
and
yard
-
arm
,
board
and
board
,
and
of
heaving
grapplings
,
and
stink
-
pots
,
and
grapes
,
and
round
and
double
-
headed
partridges
,
crows
and
carters
 
Laud
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
he
has
been
a
great
warrior
in
his
time
,
and
lost
an
eye
and
a
heel
in
the
service
  
<EOS>
Then
,
he
does
not
live
like
any
other
Christian
land
-
man
;
but
keeps
garrison
in
his
house
,
as
if
he
were
in
the
midst
of
his
enemies
,
and
makes
his
servants
turn
out
in
the
night
,
watch
and
watch
(
as
he
calls
it
)
<EOS>
all
the
year
round
.
<EOS>
His
habitation
is
defended
by
a
ditch
,
over
which
he
has
laid
a
draw
-
bridge
,
and
planted
his
court
-
yard
with
patereroes
continually
loaded
with
shot
,
under
the
direction
of
one
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
had
one
of
his
legs
shot
away
,
while
he
acted
as
lieutenant
on
board
of
the
commodore
's
ship
;
and
now
,
being
on
half
-
pay
,
lives
with
him
as
his
companion
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
is
a
very
brave
man
,
a
great
joker
,
and
,
as
the
saying
is
,
hath
got
the
length
of
his
commander
's
foot
 
Tho
'
he
has
another
favourite
in
the
house
called
Tom
Pipes
<EOS>
,
that
was
his
boatswain
's
mate
,
and
now
keeps
the
servants
in
order
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
is
a
man
of
few
words
,
but
an
excellent
hand
at
a
song
concerning
the
boatswain
's
whistle
,
husslecap
and
chuck
-
farthing
 
there
is
not
such
another
pipe
in
the
county
 
So
that
the
commodore
lives
very
happy
in
his
own
manner
;
thof
he
be
sometimes
thrown
into
perilous
passions
and
quandaries
,
by
the
application
of
his
poor
kinsmen
,
whom
he
ca
n't
abide
,
because
as
how
some
of
them
were
the
first
occasion
of
his
going
to
sea
.
<EOS>
Then
he
sweats
with
agony
at
the
sight
of
an
attorney
;
just
for
all
the
world
,
as
some
people
have
an
antipathy
at
a
cat
;
for
it
seems
he
was
once
at
law
,
for
striking
one
of
his
officers
,
and
cast
in
a
swinging
sum
.
<EOS>
He
is
,
moreover
,
exceedingly
afflicted
with
goblins
that
disturb
his
rest
,
and
keep
such
a
racket
in
his
house
,
that
you
would
think
(
God
bless
us
!
)
<EOS>
all
the
devils
in
hell
had
broke
loose
upon
him
.
<EOS>
It
was
no
longer
ago
than
last
year
about
this
time
,
that
he
was
tormented
the
live
-
long
night
by
two
mischievous
spirits
that
got
into
his
chamber
,
and
played
a
thousand
pranks
about
his
hammock
,
<EOS>
(
for
there
is
not
one
bed
within
his
walls
.
)
<EOS>
Well
,
Sir
,
he
rung
his
bell
,
called
up
all
his
servants
,
got
lights
,
and
made
a
thorough
search
;
but
the
devil
a
goblin
was
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
turned
in
again
,
and
the
rest
of
the
family
gone
to
sleep
,
than
the
foul
fiends
began
their
game
anew
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
got
up
in
the
dark
,
drew
his
cutlass
,
and
attacked
them
both
so
manfully
,
that
,
in
five
minutes
,
every
thing
in
the
apartment
went
to
pieces
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
hearing
the
noise
,
came
to
his
assistance
;
and
Tom
Pipes
being
told
what
was
the
matter
,
lighted
his
match
,
and
going
down
to
the
yard
,
fired
all
the
patereroes
,
as
signals
of
distress
.
    
<EOS>
Well
,
to
be
sure
,
the
whole
parish
was
in
a
pucker
:
some
thought
the
French
had
landed
;
others
imagined
the
commodore
's
house
was
beset
by
thieves
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
called
up
two
dragoons
that
are
quartered
upon
me
;
and
they
swore
with
deadly
oaths
,
it
was
a
gang
of
smugglers
engaged
with
a
party
of
their
regiment
that
lies
in
the
next
village
;
and
mounting
their
horses
like
lusty
fellows
,
rode
up
into
the
country
as
fast
as
their
beasts
could
carry
them
.
<EOS>
Ah
,
Master
!
<EOS>
these
are
hard
times
,
when
an
industrious
body
can
not
earn
his
bread
,
without
fear
of
the
gallows
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
's
father
(
God
rest
his
soul
!
)
was
a
good
gentleman
,
and
as
well
respected
in
this
parish
,
as
e'er
a
<EOS>
he
that
walks
upon
neat
's
leather
.
<EOS>
And
if
your
honour
should
want
a
small
parcel
of
fine
tea
,
or
a
few
anchors
of
right
Nantz
,
I
'll
be
bound
you
shall
be
furnished
to
your
heart
's
content
.
<EOS>
But
,
as
I
was
saying
,
the
hubbub
continued
till
morning
,
when
the
parson
being
sent
for
,
conjured
the
spirits
into
the
Red
Sea
;
and
the
house
has
been
pretty
quiet
ever
since
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
Mr
Hatchway
makes
a
mock
of
the
whole
affair
;
and
told
his
commander
in
this
very
blessed
spot
,
that
the
two
goblins
were
no
other
than
a
couple
of
jackdaws
which
had
fallen
down
the
chimney
,
and
made
a
flapping
with
their
wings
up
and
down
the
apartment
.
<EOS>
But
the
commodore
,
who
is
very
choleric
,
and
does
not
like
to
be
jeered
,
fell
into
a
main
high
passion
,
and
stormed
like
a
perfect
hurricane
,
swearing
that
he
knew
a
devil
from
a
jack
-
daw
as
well
as
e'er
a
man
in
the
three
kingdoms
.
<EOS>
He
owned
,
indeed
,
that
the
birds
were
found
,
but
denied
that
they
were
the
occasion
of
the
uproar
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
Master
,
I
believe
much
may
be
said
on
both
sides
of
the
question
;
thof
to
be
sure
,
the
devil
is
always
going
about
,
as
the
saying
is
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
circumstantial
account
,
extraordinary
as
it
was
,
never
altered
one
feature
in
the
countenance
of
Mr
Pickle
,
who
having
heard
it
to
an
end
,
took
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
saying
,
with
a
look
of
infinite
sagacity
and
deliberation
,
"
I
do
suppose
he
is
of
the
Cornish
Trunnions
.
<EOS>
What
sort
of
a
woman
is
his
spouse
?
"
<EOS>
"
Spouse
!
<EOS>
cried
the
other
;
odd
's
heart
!
<EOS>
I
do
n't
think
he
would
marry
the
queen
of
Sheba
.
<EOS>
Lack
a
day
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
he
wo
n't
suffer
his
own
maids
to
lie
in
the
garrison
,
but
turns
them
into
an
out
-
house
,
every
night
,
before
the
watch
is
set
.
<EOS>
Bless
your
honour
's
soul
!
<EOS>
he
is
,
as
it
were
,
a
very
oddish
kind
of
a
gentleman
.
<EOS>
Your
worship
would
have
seen
him
before
now
;
for
,
when
he
is
well
,
he
and
my
good
master
Hatchway
come
hither
every
evening
,
and
drink
a
couple
of
canns
of
rumbo
apiece
;
but
he
has
been
confined
to
his
house
this
fortnight
,
by
a
plaguy
fit
of
the
gout
,
which
,
I
'll
assure
your
worship
,
is
a
good
penny
out
of
my
pocket
.
"
    
<EOS>
At
that
instant
,
Mr
Pickle
's
ears
were
saluted
with
such
a
strange
noise
,
as
even
discomposed
the
muscles
of
his
face
,
which
gave
immediate
indications
of
alarm
.
<EOS>
This
composition
of
notes
at
first
resembled
the
crying
of
quails
,
and
croaking
of
bull
-
frogs
;
but
,
as
it
approached
nearer
,
he
could
distinguish
articulate
sounds
pronounced
with
great
violence
,
in
such
a
cadence
as
one
would
expect
from
a
human
creature
scolding
thro
'
the
organs
of
an
ass
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
neither
speaking
nor
braying
,
but
a
surprising
mixture
of
both
,
employed
in
the
utterance
of
terms
absolutely
unintelligible
to
our
wondering
merchant
,
who
had
just
opened
his
mouth
to
express
his
curiosity
,
when
the
landlord
,
starting
up
at
the
well
known
sound
,
cried
,
"
Odd
's
niggers
!
<EOS>
there
is
the
commodore
with
his
company
,
as
sure
as
I
live
!
"
<EOS>
and
with
his
apron
began
to
wipe
the
dust
off
an
elbow
-
chair
placed
at
one
side
of
the
fire
,
and
kept
sacred
for
the
ease
and
convenience
of
this
infirm
commander
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
occupied
,
a
voice
still
more
uncouth
than
the
former
,
bawled
aloud
,
"
<EOS>
Ho
!
<EOS>
the
house
,
a
hoy
!
"
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
publican
,
clapping
an
hand
to
each
side
of
his
head
,
with
his
thumbs
fixed
on
his
ears
,
rebellowed
in
the
same
tone
,
which
he
had
learned
to
imitate
,
"
Hilloah
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
voice
again
exclaimed
,
"
Have
you
got
any
attorneys
aboard
?
"
<EOS>
and
when
the
landlord
replied
,
"
No
,
no
;
"
this
man
of
strange
expectation
came
in
,
supported
by
his
two
dependants
,
and
displayed
a
figure
every
way
answerable
to
the
oddity
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
was
in
stature
at
least
six
feet
high
,
tho
'
he
had
contracted
an
habit
of
stooping
,
by
living
so
long
on
board
;
his
complexion
was
tawny
,
and
his
aspect
rendered
hideous
by
a
large
scar
across
his
nose
,
and
a
patch
that
covered
the
place
of
one
eye
.
<EOS>
Being
seated
in
his
chair
,
with
great
formality
the
landlord
complimented
him
upon
his
being
able
to
come
abroad
again
;
and
having
,
in
a
whisper
,
communicated
the
name
of
his
fellow
-
guest
,
whom
the
commodore
already
knew
by
report
,
went
to
prepare
,
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
,
the
first
allowance
of
his
favourite
liquor
,
in
three
separate
canns
,
<EOS>
(
for
each
was
accommodated
with
his
own
portion
apart
)
while
the
lieutenant
sat
down
on
the
blind
-
side
of
his
commander
;
and
<EOS>
Tom
Pipes
,
knowing
his
distance
,
with
great
modesty
took
his
station
in
the
rear
.
    
<EOS>
After
a
pause
of
some
minutes
,
the
conversation
was
begun
by
this
ferocious
chief
,
who
fixing
his
eye
upon
the
lieutenant
with
a
sternness
of
countenance
not
to
be
described
,
addressed
him
in
these
words
:
"
D####n
<EOS>
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
I
always
took
you
to
be
a
better
seaman
than
to
overset
our
chaise
in
such
fair
weather
.
<EOS>
Blood
!
<EOS>
did
n't
I
tell
you
we
were
running
bump
ashore
,
and
bid
you
set
in
the
lee
-
brace
,
and
haul
upon
a
wind
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
replied
the
other
with
an
arch
sneer
.
<EOS>
I
do
confess
as
how
you
did
give
such
orders
,
after
you
had
run
us
foul
of
a
post
,
so
as
that
the
carriage
lay
along
,
and
could
not
right
herself
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
run
you
foul
of
a
post
!
<EOS>
cried
the
commander
;
d####n
my
heart
!
<EOS>
you
're
a
pretty
dog
,
an't
<EOS>
you
,
to
tell
me
so
above
board
to
my
face
?
<EOS>
Did
I
take
charge
of
the
chaise
?
<EOS>
Did
I
stand
at
the
helm
?
"
<EOS>
No
,
answered
Hatchway
;
that
I
must
confess
you
did
not
steer
;
but
howsomever
,
you
cunned
all
the
way
,
and
so
,
as
you
could
not
see
how
the
land
lay
,
being
blind
of
your
larboard
eye
,
we
were
fast
ashore
,
before
you
knew
any
thing
of
the
matter
.
<EOS>
Pipes
,
who
stood
abaft
,
can
testify
the
truth
of
what
I
say
.
"
<EOS>
"
D####n
my
limbs
!
<EOS>
resumed
the
commodore
,
I
do
n't
value
what
you
or
Pipes
says
,
a
rope
yarn
.
<EOS>
You
're
a
couple
of
mutinous
 
<EOS>
I
'll
say
no
more
;
<EOS>
but
,
you
sha
n't
run
your
rig
upon
me
.
<EOS>
Damn
ye
,
I
am
the
man
that
learnt
you
,
Jack
Hatchway
,
to
splice
a
rope
,
and
raise
a
perpendicular
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
who
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
trim
of
his
captain
,
did
not
chuse
to
carry
on
the
altercation
any
farther
;
but
,
taking
up
his
cann
,
drank
to
the
health
of
the
stranger
,
who
very
courteously
returned
the
compliment
,
without
,
however
,
presuming
to
join
in
the
conversation
,
which
suffered
a
considerable
pause
.
    
<EOS>
During
this
interruption
,
Mr
Hatchway
's
wit
display'd
itself
in
several
practical
jokes
upon
the
commodore
,
with
whom
,
he
knew
,
it
was
dangerous
to
tamper
in
any
other
way
.
<EOS>
Being
without
the
sphere
of
his
vision
,
he
securely
pilfered
his
tobacco
,
drank
his
rumbo
,
made
wry
faces
,
and
(
to
use
the
vulgar
phrase
)
cocked
his
eye
at
him
,
to
the
no
small
entertainment
of
the
spectators
,
Mr
Pickle
himself
not
excepted
,
who
gave
evident
tokens
of
uncommon
satisfaction
at
the
dexterity
of
this
marine
pantomime
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
captain
's
choler
gradually
subsided
,
and
he
was
pleased
to
desire
Hatchway
by
the
familiar
and
friendly
diminutive
of
Jack
,
to
read
a
news
-
paper
that
lay
on
the
table
before
him
.
<EOS>
This
task
was
accordingly
undertaken
by
the
lame
lieutenant
,
who
,
among
other
paragraphs
,
read
that
which
follows
,
with
an
elevation
of
voice
that
seemed
to
prognosticate
something
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
"
We
are
informed
that
admiral
Bower
will
very
soon
be
created
a
British
peer
,
for
his
eminent
services
during
the
war
,
particularly
in
his
late
engagement
with
the
French
fleet
.
<EOS>
"
Trunnion
was
thunder
-
struck
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
.
<EOS>
The
mug
dropt
from
his
hand
,
and
shivered
into
a
thousand
pieces
;
his
eye
glistened
like
that
of
a
rattle
-
snake
,
and
some
minutes
elapsed
before
he
could
pronounce
,
"
Avast
!
<EOS>
overhaul
that
article
again
.
<EOS>
"
It
was
no
sooner
read
the
second
time
,
than
smiting
the
table
with
his
fist
,
he
started
up
,
and
with
the
most
violent
emphasis
of
rage
and
indignation
,
exclaimed
,
"
D####n
my
heart
and
liver
?
'
<EOS>
tis
a
land
lie
,
d'ye
see
;
and
I
will
maintain
it
to
be
a
lie
,
from
the
sprit
-
sail
-
yard
to
the
mizzen
top
-
sail
haulyards
!
<EOS>
blood
and
thunder
!
    
<EOS>
Will
.
<EOS>
Bower
a
peer
of
this
realm
!
<EOS>
a
fellow
of
yesterday
,
that
scarce
knows
a
mast
from
a
manger
;
a
snotty
-
nose
boy
,
whom
I
myself
have
ordered
to
the
gun
,
for
stealing
eggs
out
of
the
hen
-
coops
!
<EOS>
and
I
Hawser
Trunnion
,
who
commanded
a
ship
before
he
could
keep
a
reckoning
,
am
laid
aside
,
d'ye
see
,
and
forgotten
!
<EOS>
If
so
be
,
as
this
be
the
case
,
there
is
a
rotten
plank
in
our
constitution
,
which
ought
to
be
hove
down
and
repaired
,
damn
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
d'ye
see
,
I
was
none
of
your
Guinea
-
pigs
;
I
did
not
rise
in
the
service
by
parliamenteering
interest
,
or
a
handsome
bitch
of
a
wife
.
<EOS>
I
was
not
hoisted
over
the
bellies
of
better
men
,
nor
strutted
athwart
the
quarter
-
deck
in
a
laced
doublet
and
thingumbobs
at
the
wrists
.
<EOS>
Damn
my
limbs
!
<EOS>
I
have
been
a
hard
-
working
man
,
and
served
all
offices
on
board
from
cook
's
shifter
to
the
command
of
a
vessel
.
<EOS>
Here
,
you
Tunley
,
there
's
the
hand
of
a
seaman
,
you
dog
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
laid
hold
on
the
landlord
's
fist
,
and
honoured
him
with
such
a
squeeze
,
as
compelled
him
to
roar
with
great
vociferation
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
the
commodore
,
whose
features
were
a
little
unbended
,
by
this
acknowledgment
of
his
vigour
;
and
he
thus
proceeded
in
a
less
outrageous
strain
:
"
They
make
a
damned
noise
about
this
engagement
with
the
French
:
but
,
agad
!
<EOS>
it
was
no
more
than
a
bum
-
boat
battle
,
in
comparison
with
some
that
I
have
seen
.
<EOS>
There
was
old
Rook
and
Jennings
,
and
another
whom
I
'll
be
damned
before
I
name
,
that
knew
what
fighting
was
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
share
,
d'ye
see
,
I
am
none
of
those
that
hollow
in
their
own
commendation
:
but
if
so
be
that
I
were
minded
to
stand
my
own
trumpeter
<EOS>
,
some
of
those
little
fellows
that
hold
their
heads
so
high
,
would
be
taken
all
aback
,
as
the
saying
is
;
they
would
be
ashamed
to
shew
their
colours
,
d####n
my
eyes
!
<EOS>
I
once
lay
eight
glasses
along
-
side
of
the
Floor
de
Louse
,
a
French
man
of
war
,
tho
'
<EOS>
her
metal
was
heavier
,
and
her
complement
larger
by
an
hundred
hands
than
mine
.
<EOS>
You
,
Jack
Hatchway
,
damn
ye
,
<EOS>
what
d'ye
grin
at
?
<EOS>
D'ye
think
I
tell
a
story
,
because
you
never
heard
it
before
?
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
ye
,
Sir
,
answered
the
lieutenant
,
I
'm
glad
to
find
you
can
stand
your
own
trumpeter
,
on
occasion
;
thof
I
wish
you
would
change
the
tune
;
for
that
is
the
same
you
have
been
piping
every
watch
,
for
these
ten
months
past
.
<EOS>
Tunley
himself
will
tell
you
,
he
has
heard
it
five
hundred
times
.
"
<EOS>
"
God
forgive
you
,
Mr
Hatchway
,
said
the
landlord
,
interrupting
him
;
as
I
'm
an
honest
man
,
and
a
housekeeper
,
I
never
heard
a
syllab
of
the
matter
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
declaration
,
tho
'
not
strictly
true
,
was
extremely
agreeable
to
Mr
Trunnion
,
who
,
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
observed
,
"
Aha
!
<EOS>
Jack
,
I
thought
I
should
bring
you
up
,
with
your
gibes
and
your
jokes
.
<EOS>
But
suppose
you
had
heard
it
before
,
is
that
any
reason
why
it
should
n't
be
told
to
another
person
?
    
<EOS>
There
's
the
stranger
,
belike
<EOS>
he
has
heard
it
five
hundred
times
too
;
han't
ye
,
brother
?
"
addressing
himself
to
Mr
Pickle
;
who
,
replying
with
a
look
expressing
curiosity
,
"
No
,
never
;
"
he
thus
went
on
:
"
<EOS>
Well
,
you
seem
to
be
an
honest
,
quiet
sort
of
a
man
;
and
therefore
,
you
must
know
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
fell
in
with
a
French
man
of
war
,
Cape
Finisterre
bearing
about
six
leagues

the

three

going

<EOS>
whereupon
I
set
my
studding
-
sails
,
and
coming
up
with
her
,
hoisted
my
jack
and
ensign
,
and
poured
in
a
whole
broadside
,
before
you
could
count
three
rattlins
in
the
mizzen
shrouds
;
for
I
always
keep
a
good
look

out

and
love
to
have
the
first
fire
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
I
'll
be
sworn

said
Hatchway
;
for
the
day
we
made
the
Triumph

you
ordered
the
men
to
fire

when
she
was

by
the

token
<EOS>
we
below
pointed
the
guns
at
a
flight
of
gulls
;
and
I
won
a
cann
of
punch
from
the
gunner
,
by
killing
the
first
bird
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Exasperated
at
this
sarcasm
,
he
replied
with
great
vehemence
,
"
You
lie
,
lubber

<EOS>
d####n
<EOS>

<EOS>
what
business
have
you
to
come
<EOS>
always
athwart
my
hawse
in
this
manner

<EOS>
You
,
Pipes

was
upon
deck
,
and
can
bear
witness
,
whether
or
not
I
fired
too
soon

<EOS>
Speak

<EOS>

upon
the
word
of
a

:
how
did
the
chace

of
us
,
when
I
gave
orders
to
fire
?
"
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
who
hitherto
had
sat
silent
,
being
thus
called
upon
to
give
his
evidence
,
after
diverse
strange
gesticulations
,
opened
his
mouth
like
a
gasping
cod
,
and
with
a
cadence
like
that
of
the
east
wind
singing
through
a
cranny
,
pronounced
,
"
<EOS>
Half
a
quarter

Nearer

<EOS>
(
cried
the
commodore
)
nearer
by
twelve
fathom
:
<EOS>
but
,
howsomever
,
that
's
enough
to
prove
the
falsehood
of
Hatchway
's
jaw
 
and
so
,
brother
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
(
turning
to
Mr
Pickle
)
<EOS>
I
lay
along
-
side
of
the
Floor
de
Louse
,
yard
-
arm
and
yard

,
plying
our
great
guns
and
small
arms
,
and
heaving
in
stink
-
pots
,
powder
-
bottles
,
and
hand
-
grenades
,
till
our
shot
was
all
expended
,
double

headed
,
partridge
and
grape
:
then
we
loaded
with
iron
crows
,
marlin
spikes
,
and
old
nails
,
but
finding
the
Frenchman
took
a
great
deal
of
drubbing
,
and
that
he
had
shot
away
all
our
rigging
,
and
killed
and
wounded
a
great
number
of
our
men
,
d'ye
see
,
I
resolved
to
run
him
on
board
upon
his
quarter
,
and
so
ordered
our
grapplings
to
be
got
ready
;
but
Monsieur
perceiving
what
we
were
about
,
filled
his
topsails
and
sheered
off
,
leaving
us
like
a
log
upon
the
water
,
and
our
scuppers
running
with
blood
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
and
the
landlord
paid
such
extraordinary
attention
to
the
rehearsal
of
this
exploit
,
that
Trunnion
was
encouraged
to
entertain
them
with
more
stories
of
the
same
nature
,
after
which
he
observed
by
way
of
encomium
on
the
government
,
that
all
he
had
gained
in
the
service
was
a
lame
foot
and
the
loss
of
an
eye
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
who
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
lose
any
opportunity
of
being
witty
at
the
expence
of
his
commander
,
gave
a
loose
to
his
satirical
talent
once
more
,
saying
,
"
I
have
heard
as
how
you
came
by
your
lame
foot
,
by
having
your
upper
-
decks
overstowed
with
liquor
,
whereby
you
became
crank
,
and
rolled
,
d'ye
see
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
by
a
pitch
of
the
ship
,
your
starboard
heel
was
jammed
in
one
of
the
scuppers
;
and
as
for
the
matter
of
your
eye
,
that
was
knocked
out
by
your
own
crew
when
the
Lightning
was
paid
off
:
there
's
poor
Pipes
,
who
was
beaten
into
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
for
taking
your
part
,
and
giving
you
time
to
sheer
off
;
and
I
do
n't
find
as
how
you
have
rewarded
him
according
as
he
deserves
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
As
the
commodore
could
not
deny
the
truth
of
these
anecdotes
,
however
unseasonably
they
were
introduced
,
he
affected
to
receive
them
with
good
humour
,
as
jokes
of
the
lieutenant
's
own
inventing
;
and
reply'd
,
"
Ay
,
ay
,
Jack
,
every
body
knows
your
tongue
is
no
slander
;
but
,
howsomever
,
I
'll
work
you
to
an
oil
for
this
,
you
dog
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
lifted
up
one
of
his
crutches
,
intending
to
lay
it
gently
a
-
cross
Mr
Hatchway
's
pate
;
but
,
Jack
,
with
great
agility
,
tilted
up
his
wooden
leg
,
with
which
he
warded
off
the
blow
,
to
the
no
small
admiration
of
Mr
Pickle
,
and
utter
astonishment
of
the
landlord
,
who
,
by
the
bye
,
had
expressed
the
same
amazement
,
at
the
same
feat
,
at
the
same
hour
,
every
night
,
for
three
months
before
.
<EOS>
Trunnion
then
directing
his
eye
to
the
boatswain
's
mate
,
"
You
,
Pipes
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
do
you
go
about
and
tell
people
that
I
did
not
reward
you
for
standing
by
me
,
when
I
was
hussled
by
those
rebellious
rapscallions
;
damn
you
,
ha'n't
<EOS>
you
been
rated
on
the
books
ever
since
?
<EOS>
"
Tom
,
who
indeed
had
no
words
to
spare
,
sat
smoaking
his
pipe
with
great
indifference
,
and
never
dreamed
of
paying
any
regard
to
these
interrogations
,
which
being
repeated
and
reinforced
with
many
oaths
,
that
(
however
)
produced
no
effect
,
the
commodore
pulled
out
his
purse
,
saying
,
"
Here
,
you
bitch
's
baby
,
here
's
something
better
than
a
smart
ticket
;
and
threw
it
at
his
silent
deliverer
,
who
received
and
pocketed
his
bounty
,
without
the
least
demonstration
of
surprize
or
satisfaction
;
while
the
donor
turning
to
Mr
Pickle
,
"
You
see
brother
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
make
good
the
old
saying
,
we
sailors
get
money
like
horses
,
and
spend
it
like
asses
;
come
,
Pipes
,
<EOS>
let
's
have
the
boatswain
's
whistle
,
and
be
jovial
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
musician
accordingly
,
applied
to
his
mouth
the
silver
instrument
that
hung
at
a
button
-
hole
of
his
jacket
,
by
a
chain
of
the
same
metal
,
and
though
not
quite
so
ravishing
as
the
pipe
of
Hermes
,
produced
a
found
so
loud
and
shrill
,
that
the
stranger
(
as
it
were
instinctively
)
stopped
his
ears
,
to
preserve
his
organs
of
hearing
from
such
a
dangerous
invasion
.
<EOS>
The
prelude
being
thus
executed
,
Pipes
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
egg
of
an
ostrich
that
depended
from
the
cieling
,
and
without
once
moving
them
from
that
object
,
performed
the
whole
cantata
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
seemed
to
be
the
joint
issue
of
an
Irish
bagpipe
,
and
a
sow
-
gelder
's
horn
;
the
commodore
,
the
lieutenant
and
landlord
joined
in
the
chorus
,
repeating
this
elegant
stanza
,
    
Bustle
,
bustle
,
brave
boys
!
<EOS>
Let
us
sing
,
let
us
toil
,
And
drink
all
the
while
,
Since
labour
's
the
price
of
our
joys
.
    
<EOS>
The
third
line
was
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
the
cann
was
lifted
to
every
man
's
mouth
with
admirable
uniformity
;
and
the
next
word
taken
up
at
the
end
of
their
draught
,
with
a
twang
equally
expressive
and
harmonious
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
company
began
to
understand
one
another
;
Mr
Pickle
seemed
to
relish
the
entertainment
,
and
a
correspondence
immediately
commenced
between
him
and
Trunnion
,
who
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
drank
to
further
acquaintance
,
and
even
invited
him
to
a
mess
of
pork
and
pease
in
the
garrison
.
<EOS>
The
compliment
was
returned
,
good
fellowship
prevailed
,
and
the
night
was
pretty
far
advanced
,
when
the
merchant
's
man
arrived
with
a
lanthorn
to
light
his
master
home
;
upon
which
,
the
new
friends
parted
,
after
a
mutual
promise
of
meeting
next
evening
in
the
same
place
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
III
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
exerts
herself
in
finding
a
proper
match
for
her
brother
;
who
is
accordingly
introduced
to
the
young
lady
whom
he
marries
in
due
season
.
   
<EOS>
I
have
been
the
more
circumstantial
in
opening
the
character
of
Trunnion
,
because
he
bears
a
considerable
share
in
the
course
of
these
memoirs
;
but
,
now
it
is
high
time
to
resume
the
consideration
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
,
since
her
arrival
in
the
country
,
had
been
engrossed
by
a
double
care
,
namely
,
that
of
finding
a
suitable
match
for
her
brother
,
and
a
comfortable
yoke
-
fellow
for
herself
.
    
<EOS>
Neither
was
this
aim
the
result
of
any
sinister
or
frail
suggestion
,
but
the
pure
dictates
of
that
laudable
ambition
,
which
prompted
her
to
the
preservation
of
the
family
name
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
disinterested
was
she
in
this
pursuit
,
that
,
postponing
her
nearest
concern
,
or
at
least
leaving
her
own
fate
to
the
silent
operation
of
her
charms
,
she
laboured
with
such
indefatigable
zeal
in
behalf
of
her
brother
,
that
before
they
had
been
three
months
settled
in
the
country
,
the
general
topick
of
conversation
in
the
neighbourhood
,
was
an
intended
match
between
the
rich
Mr
Pickle
and
the
fair
miss
Appleby
,
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
next
parish
,
and
who
,
though
he
had
but
little
fortune
to
bestow
upon
his
children
,
had
to
(
use
his
own
phrase
)
replenished
their
veins
with
some
of
the
best
blood
in
the
county
.
    
<EOS>
This
young
lady
,
whose
character
and
disposition
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
had
investigated
to
her
own
satisfaction
,
was
destined
for
the
spouse
of
Mr
Pickle
,
and
an
overture
accordingly
made
to
her
father
,
who
being
overjoyed
at
the
proposal
,
gave
his
consent
without
hesitation
,
and
even
recommended
the
immediate
execution
of
the
project
with
such
eagerness
,
as
seemed
to
indicate
either
a
suspicion
of
Mr
Pickle
's
constancy
,
or
a
diffidence
of
his
own
daughter
's
complexion
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
thought
too
sanguine
,
to
keep
much
longer
cool
.
<EOS>
The
previous
point
being
thus
settled
,
our
merchant
,
at
the
instigation
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
went
to
visit
his
future
father
-
in
-
law
,
and
was
introduced
to
the
daughter
,
with
whom
he
had
,
that
same
afternoon
,
an
opportunity
of
being
alone
.
<EOS>
What
passed
in
that
interview
,
I
never
could
learn
,
though
from
the
character
of
the
suitor
,
the
reader
may
justly
conclude
that
she
was
not
much
teized
with
the
impertinence
of
his
addresses
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
I
believe
,
the
less
welcome
for
that
reason
;
certain
it
is
,
she
made
no
objection
to
his
taciturnity
,
and
when
her
father
communicated
his
resolution
,
acquiesced
with
the
most
pious
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
Mrs
Grizzle
,
in
order
to
give
the
lady
a
more
favourable
idea
of
his
intellects
than
what
his
conversation
could
possibly
inspire
,
was
resolved
to
dictate
a
letter
,
which
her
brother
should
transcribe
and
transmit
to
his
mistress
,
as
the
produce
of
his
own
understanding
;
and
had
actually
composed
a
very
tender
billet
for
this
purpose
;
yet
her
intention
was
intirely
frustrated
by
the
misapprehension
of
the
lover
himself
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
his
sister
's
repeated
admonitions
,
anticipated
her
scheme
,
by
writing
for
himself
,
and
dispatching
the
letter
one
afternoon
,
while
Mrs
Grizzle
was
visiting
at
the
parson
's
.
    
<EOS>
Neither
was
this
step
the
effect
of
his
vanity
or
precipitation
;
but
having
been
often
assured
by
his
sister
,
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
him
to
make
a
declaration
of
his
love
in
writing
,
he
took
this
opportunity
of
acting
in
conformity
to
her
advice
,
when
his
imagination
was
unengaged
or
undisturbed
by
any
other
suggestion
,
without
suspecting
in
the
least
,
that
she
intended
to
save
him
the
trouble
of
exercising
his
own
genius
.
<EOS>
Left
,
therefore
,
as
he
imagined
,
to
his
own
inventions
,
he
sat
down
and
produced
the
following
morceau
,
which
was
transmitted
to
miss
Appleby
,
before
his
sister
and
counsellor
had
the
least
intimation
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Miss
Sally
Appleby

Madam

<EOS>
Understanding
<EOS>
you
have
a
parcel
of
heart
,
warranted
sound
,
to
be
disposed
of
,
shall
be
willing
to
treat
for
said
commodity
,
on
reasonable
terms
;
doubt
not
,

agree
for

;
shall
wait

further

<EOS>
This
the
needful
from
 
Yours

&
c.
Gam
Pickle

<EOS>
This
laconic
epistle
,
simple
and
unadorned
as
it
was
,
met
with
as
cordial
a
reception
from
the
person
to
whom
it
was
addressed
,
as
if
it
had
been
couched
in
the
most
elegant
terms
that
delicacy
of
passion
and
cultivated
genius
could
supply
<EOS>
:
nay
,
I
believe
,
was
the
more
welcome
,
on
account
of
its
mercantile
plainness
;
because
when
an
advantageous
match
is
in
view
,
a
sensible
woman
often
considers
the
flowery
professions
and
rapturous
exclamations
of
love
,
as
ensnaring
ambiguities
,
or
at
best
impertinent
preliminaries
,
that
retard
the
treaty
they
are
designed
to
promote
:
whereas
Mr
Pickle
removed
all
disagreeable
uncertainty
,
by
descending
at
once
to
the
most
interesting
particular
.
    
<EOS>
She
had
no
sooner
,
as
a
dutiful
child
,
communicated
this
billet
-
doux
to
her
father
,
than
he
as
a
careful
parent
visited
Mr
Pickle
,
and
in
presence
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
demanded
a
formal
explanation
of
his
sentiments
with
regard
to
his
daughter
Sally
.
<EOS>
Mr
Gamaliel
,
without
any
ceremony
,
assured
him
he
had
a
respect
for
the
young
woman
,
and
with
his
good
leave
,
would
take
her
for
better
for
worse
;
and
<EOS>
Mr
Appleby
,
after
having
expressed
his
satisfaction
that
he
had
fixed
his
affections
in
his
family
,
and
comforted
the
lover
with
the
assurance
of
his
being
agreeable
to
the
young
lady
,
they
forthwith
proceeded
to
the
articles
of
the
marriage
-
settlement
,
which
being
discussed
and
determined
,
a
lawyer
was
ordered
to
engross
them
;
the
wedding
cloaths
were
bought
,
and
in
short
,
a
day
was
appointed
for
the
celebration
of
their
nuptials
,
to
which
every
body
of
any
fashion
in
the
neighbourhood
was
invited
.
<EOS>
Among
these
commodore
Trunnion
and
Mr
Hatchway
were
not
forgotten
,
being
the
sole
companions
of
the
bridegroom
,
with
whom
,
by
this
time
,
they
had
contracted
a
sort
of
intimacy
at
their
nocturnal
rendezvous
.
    
<EOS>
They
had
received
a
previous
intimation
of
what
was
on
the
anvil
,
from
the
landlord
,
before
Mr
Pickle
thought
proper
to
declare
himself
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
topick
of
the
one
eyed
commander
's
discourse
at
their
meeting
for
several
evenings
before
,
had
been
the
folly
and
plague
of
matrimony
;
on
which
he
held
forth
with
great
vehemence
of
abuse
,
levelled
at
the
fair
sex
,
whom
he
represented
as
devils
incarnate
sent
from
hell
,
to
torment
mankind
;
and
in
particular
,
inveighed
against
old
maids
,
for
whom
he
seemed
to
entertain
a
singular
aversion
;
while
his
friend
Jack
confirmed
the
truth
of
all
his
allegations
,
and
gratified
his
own
malignant
vein
at
the
same
time
,
by
clenching
every
sentence
with
a
sly
joke
upon
the
married
state
,
built
upon
some
allusion
to
a
ship
or
sea
-
faring
life
.
<EOS>
He
compared
a
woman
to
a
great
gun
loaded
with
fire
,
brimstone
and
noise
,
which
being
violently
heated
,
will
bounce
and
fly
,
and
play
the
devil
,
if
you
do
n't
take
special
care
of
her
breechings
.
<EOS>
He
said
she
was
like
a
hurricane
that
never
blows
from
one
quarter
,
but
veers
about
to
all
points
of
the
compass
:
he
likened
her
to
a
painted
galley
curiously
rigged
,
with
a
leak
in
her
hold
,
which
her
husband
would
never
be
able
to
stop
.
<EOS>
He
observed
that
her
inclinations
were
like
the
Bay
of
Biscay
;
for
why
?
<EOS>
because
you
may
heave
your
deep
sea
lead
long
enough
,
without
ever
reaching
the
bottom
.
<EOS>
That
he
who
comes
to
an
anchor
on
a
wife
,
may
find
himself
moored
in
damned
foul
ground
,
and
after
all
,
ca
n't
for
his
blood
slip
his
cable
;
and
that
for
his
own
part
,
thof
he
might
make
short
trips
for
pastime
,
he
would
never
embark
in
woman
on
the
voyage
of
life
,
because
he
was
afraid
of
foundering
in
the
first
foul
weather
.
    
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
these
insinuations
made
some
impression
on
the
mind
of
Mr
Pickle
,
who
was
not
very
much
inclined
to
run
great
risks
of
any
kind
;
but
the
injunctions
and
importunities
of
his
sister
,
who
was
bent
upon
the
match
,
over
-
balanced
the
opinion
of
his
sea
friends
,
who
finding
him
determined
to
marry
,
notwithstanding
all
the
hints
of
caution
they
had
thrown
out
,
resolved
to
accept
his
invitation
,
and
honoured
his
nuptials
with
their
presence
accordingly
.

Chapter
IV
<EOS>
The
behaviour
of
Mrs
Grizzle
at
the
wedding
,
with
an
account
of
the
guests
.
   
<EOS>
I
hope
it
will
not
be
thought
uncharitable
,
if
I
advance
by
way
of
conjecture
,
that
Mrs
Grizzle
,
on
this
grand
occasion
,
summoned
her
whole
exertion
,
to
play
off
the
artillery
of
her
charms
,
upon
the
single
gentlemen
who
were
invited
to
the
entertainment
:
<EOS>
sure
I
am
,
she
displayed
to
the
best
advantage
all
the
engaging
qualities
she
possessed
:
<EOS>
her
affability
at
dinner
was
altogether
uncommon
,
her
attention
to
the
guests
was
superfluously
hospitable
,
her
tongue
was
sheathed
with
a
most
agreeable
and
infantine
lisp
,
her
address
was
perfectly
obliging
;
and
though
,
conscious
of
the
extraordinary
capacity
of
her
mouth
,
she
would
not
venture
to
hazard
a
laugh
,
she
modelled
her
lips
into
an
enchanting
simper
,
which
played
upon
her
countenance
all
day
long
;
nay
<EOS>
,
she
even
profited
by
that
defect
in
her
vision
we
have
already
observed
,
and
securely
contemplated
those
features
which
were
most
to
her
likeing
,
while
the
rest
of
the
company
believed
her
regards
were
disposed
in
a
quite
contrary
direction
.
    
<EOS>
With
what
humility
of
complaisance
did
she
receive
the
compliments
of
those
who
could
not
help
praising
the
elegance
of
the
banquet
!
<EOS>
and
how
piously
did
she
seize
that
opportunity
of
commemorating
the
honours
of
her
fire
,
by
observing
that
it
was
no
merit
in
her
to
understand
something
of
entertainments
,
as
she
had
occasion
to
preside
at
so
many
,
during
the
mayoralty
of
her
papa
!
<EOS>
Far
from
discovering
the
least
symptom
of
pride
and
exultation
,
when
the
opulence
of
her
family
became
the
subject
of
conversation
,
she
assumed
a
severity
of
countenance
;
and
after
having
moralized
on
the
vanity
of
riches
,
declared
that
those
who
looked
upon
her
as
a
fortune
,
were
very
much
mistaken
;
for
her
father
had
left
her
no
more
than
poor
five
thousand
pounds
,
which
,
with
what
little
she
had
saved
of
the
interest
since
his
death
,
was
all
she
had
to
depend
upon
:
indeed
,
if
she
had
placed
her
chief
felicity
in
wealth
,
she
should
not
have
been
so
forward
in
destroying
her
own
expectations
,
by
advising
and
promoting
the
event
at
which
they
were
now
so
happily
assembled
;
but
she
hoped
she
should
always
have
virtue
enough
to
postpone
any
interested
consideration
,
when
it
should
happen
to
clash
with
the
happiness
of
her
friends
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
such
was
her
modesty
and
self
denial
,
that
she
industriously
informed
those
whom
it
might
concern
,
that
she
was
no
less
than
three
years
older
than
the
bride
;
though
had
she
added
ten
to
the
reckoning
,
she
would
have
committed
no
mistake
in
point
of
computation
.
    
<EOS>
To
contribute
as
much
as
lay
in
her
power
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
present
,
she
in
the
afternoon
regaled
them
with
a
tune
on
the
harpsichord
,
accompanied
with
her
voice
,
which
,
though
not
the
most
melodious
in
the
world
,
I
dare
say
,
would
have
been
equally
at
their
service
,
could
she
have
vyed
with
Philomel
in
song
;
and
as
the
last
effort
of
her
complaisance
when
dancing
was
proposed
,
she
was
prevailed
upon
,
at
the
request
of
her
new
sister
,
to
open
the
ball
in
person
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
Mrs
Grizzle
was
the
principal
figure
in
this
festival
,
and
almost
eclipsed
the
bride
,
who
far
from
seeming
to
dispute
the
preheminence
,
very
wisely
allowed
her
to
make
the
best
of
her
talents
;
contenting
herself
with
the
lot
to
which
fortune
had
already
called
her
,
and
which
she
imagined
would
not
be
the
less
desirable
,
if
her
sister
-
in
-
law
were
detached
from
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
I
need
scarce
advertise
the
reader
,
that
during
this
whole
entertainment
,
the
commodore
and
his
lieutenant
were
quite
out
of
their
element
;
and
this
indeed
,
was
the
case
with
the
bridegroom
himself
,
who
being
utterly
unacquainted
with
any
sort
of
polite
commerce
,
found
himself
under
a
very
disagreeable
restraint
during
the
whole
scene
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
,
who
had
scarce
ever
been
on
shore
till
he
was
paid
off
,
and
never
once
in
his
whole
life
,
in
the
company
of
any
females
above
the
rank
of
those
who
herd
upon
the
point
at
Portsmouth
,
was
more
embarrassed
about
his
behaviour
than
if
he
had
been
surrounded
at
sea
by
the
whole
French
navy
.
<EOS>
He
had
never
pronounced
the
word
Madam
since
he
was
born
,
so
that
far
from
entering
into
conversation
with
the
ladies
,
he
would
not
even
return
the
compliment
,
or
give
the
least
nod
of
civility
when
they
drank
to
his
health
;
and
I
verily
believe
,
would
rather
have
suffered
suffocation
,
than
allowed
the
simple
phrase
,
your
servant
,
to
proceed
from
his
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
altogether
as
inflexible
with
respect
to
the
attitudes
of
his
body
;
for
,
either
through
obstinacy
or
bashfulness
,
he
sat
upright
without
motion
,
insomuch
that
he
provoked
the
mirth
of
a
certain
wag
,
who
addressing
himself
to
the
lieutenant
,
asked
whether
that
was
the
commodore
himself
,
or
the
wooden
lion
that
used
to
stand
at
his
gate
?
<EOS>
An
image
to
which
,
it
must
be
owned
,
Mr
Trunnion
's
person
bore
no
faint
resemblance
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
was
not
quite
so
unpolished
as
the
commodore
,
and
had
certain
notions
that
seemed
to
approach
the
ideas
of
common
life
,
made
a
less
uncouth
appearance
;
but
then
he
was
a
wit
,
and
though
of
a
very
peculiar
genius
,
partook
largely
of
that
disposition
which
is
common
to
all
wits
,
who
never
enjoy
themselves
,
except
when
their
talents
meet
with
those
marks
of
distinction
and
veneration
,
which
(
in
their
own
opinion
)
they
deserve
.
    
<EOS>
These
circumstances
being
premised
,
it
is
not
to
be
wondered
at
,
if
this
triumvirate
made
no
objections
to
the
proposal
,
when
some
of
the
grave
personages
of
the
company
made
a
motion
for
adjourning
into
another
apartment
,
where
they
might
enjoy
their
pipes
and
bottles
,
while
the
young
folks
indulged
themselves
in
the
continuance
of
their
own
favourite
diversion
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
rescued
,
as
it
were
,
from
a
state
of
annihilation
,
the
first
use
the
two
lads
of
the
castle
made
of
their
existence
,
was
to
ply
the
bridegroom
so
hard
with
bumpers
,
that
in
less
than
an
hour
he
made
divers
efforts
to
sing
,
and
soon
after
was
carried
to
bed
,
deprived
of
all
manner
of
sensation
,
to
the
utter
disappointment
of
the
bridemen
and
maids
,
who
,
by
this
accident
,
were
prevented
from
throwing
the
stocking
,
and
performing
certain
other
ceremonies
practised
on
such
occasions
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
bride
,
she
bore
this
misfortune
with
great
good
humour
,
and
indeed
,
on
all
occasions
,
behaved
like
a
discreet
woman
,
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
her
own
situation
.

Chapter
V
Mrs
Pickle
assumes
the
reins
of
government
in
her
own
family
;
her
sister
-
in
-
law
undertakes
an
enterprize
of
great
moment
;
but
is
for
some
time
diverted
from
her
purpose
,
by
a
very
interesting
consideration
.
   
<EOS>
Whatever
deference
,
not
to
say
submission
,
she
had
paid
to
Mrs
Grizzle
before
she
was
so
nearly
allied
to
her
family
,
she
no
sooner
became
Mrs
Pickle
,
than
she
thought
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
act
up
to
the
dignity
of
the
character
;
and
the
very
day
after
the
marriage
,
ventured
to
dispute
with
her
sister
in
-
law
on
the
subject
of
her
own
pedigree
,
which
she
affirmed
to
be
more
honourable
in
all
respects
than
that
of
her
husband
;
observing
that
several
younger
brothers
of
her
house
had
arrived
at
the
station
of
lord
mayor
of
London
,
which
was
the
highest
pitch
of
greatness
that
any
of
Mr
Pickle
's
predecessors
had
ever
attained
.
    
<EOS>
This
presumption
was
like
a
thunderbolt
to
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
began
to
perceive
that
she
had
not
succeeded
quite
so
well
as
she
imagined
,
in
selecting
for
her
brother
a
gentle
and
obedient
yoke
-
fellow
,
who
would
always
treat
her
with
that
profound
respect
which
she
thought
due
to
her
superior
genius
,
and
be
entirely
regulated
by
her
advice
and
direction
:
however
,
she
still
continued
to
manage
the
reins
of
government
in
the
house
,
reprehending
the
servants
as
usual
;
an
office
she
performed
with
great
capacity
,
and
in
which
she
seemed
to
take
singular
delight
,
until
Mrs
Pickle
,
on
pretence
of
consulting
her
ease
,
told
her
one
day
she
would
take
that
trouble
upon
herself
,
and
for
the
future
assume
the
management
of
her
own
family
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
mortifying
to
Mrs
Grizzle
than
such
a
declaration
,
to
which
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
and
strange
distortion
of
look
<EOS>
,
she
replied
,
"
I
shall
never
refuse
or
repine
at
any
trouble
that
may
conduce
to
my
brother
's
advantage
.
"
<EOS>
"
Dear
madam
,
"
answered
the
sister
,
"
I
am
infinitely
obliged
to
your
kind
concern
for
Mr
Pickle
's
interest
,
which
I
consider
as
my
own
,
but
I
can
not
bear
to
see
you
a
sufferer
by
your
friendship
;
and
therefore
,
insist
upon
exempting
you
from
the
fatigue
you
have
borne
so
long
.
"
    
<EOS>
In
vain
did
the
other
protest
that
she
took
pleasure
in
the
task
;
Mrs
Pickle
ascribed
the
assurance
to
her
excess
of
complaisance
,
and
expressed
such
tenderness
of
zeal
for
her
dear
sister
's
health
and
tranquillity
,
that
the
reluctant
maiden
found
herself
obliged
to
resign
her
authority
,
without
enjoying
the
least
pretext
for
complaining
of
her
being
deposed
.
    
<EOS>
This
disgrace
was
attended
by
a
fit
of
peevish
devotion
that
lasted
three
or
four
weeks
;
during
which
period
,
she
had
the
additional
chagreen
of
seeing
the
young
lady
gain
an
absolute
ascendency
over
the
mind
of
her
brother
,
who
was
persuaded
to
set
up
a
gay
equipage
,
and
improve
his
housekeeping
,
by
an
augmentation
in
his
expence
,
to
the
amount
of
a
thousand
a
year
at
least
:
tho
'
this
alteration
in
the
oeconomy
of
his
houshold
,
effected
no
change
in
his
own
disposition
,
or
manner
of
life
;
for
,
soon
as
the
painful
ceremony
of
receiving
and
returning
visits
was
performed
,
he
had
recourse
again
to
the
company
of
his
sea
-
friends
,
with
whom
he
spent
the
best
part
of
his
time
.
<EOS>
But
,
if
he
was
satisfied
with
his
condition
,
the
case
was
otherwise
with
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
finding
her
importance
in
the
family
greatly
diminished
,
her
attractions
neglected
by
all
the
male
-
sex
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
the
withering
hand
of
time
hang
threatning
over
her
head
,
began
to
feel
the
horror
of
eternal
virginity
,
and
in
a
sort
of
desperation
,
resolved
at
any
rate
to
rescue
herself
from
that
reproachful
and
uncomfortable
situation
.
<EOS>
Thus
determined
,
she
formed
a
plan
,
the
execution
of
which
,
to
a
spirit
less
enterprizing
and
sufficient
than
her
's
,
would
have
appeared
altogether
impracticable
;
this
was
no
other
than
to
make
a
conquest
of
the
commodore
's
heart
,
which
the
reader
will
easily
believe
was
not
very
susceptible
of
tender
impressions
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
fortified
with
insensibility
and
prejudice
against
the
charms
of
the
whole
sex
,
and
particularly
prepossessed
to
the
prejudice
of
that
class
distinguished
by
the
appellation
of
old
maids
,
in
which
Mrs
Grizzle
was
,
by
this
time
,
unhappily
ranked
.
    
<EOS>
She
nevertheless
took
the
field
,
and
having
invested
this
seemingly
impregnable
fortress
,
began
to
break
ground
one
day
,
when
Trunnion
dined
at
her
brother
's
,
by
springing
certain
ensnaring
commendations
on
the
honesty
and
sincerity
of
sea
-
faring
people
,
paying
a
particular
attention
to
his
plate
,
and
affecting
a
simper
of
approbation
at
every
thing
he
said
which
by
any
means
she
could
construe
into
a
joke
,
or
with
modesty
be
supposed
to
hear
:
<EOS>
nay
,
even
when
he
left
decency
on
the
left
hand
,
(
which
was
often
the
case
)
<EOS>
she
ventured
to
reprimand
his
freedom
of
speech
with
a
gracious
grin
,
saying
,
"
Sure
you
gentlemen
belonging
to
the
sea
have
such
an
odd
way
with
you
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
all
this
complacency
was
so
ineffectual
,
that
,
far
from
suspecting
the
true
cause
of
it
,
the
commodore
,
that
very
evening
,
at
the
club
,
in
presence
of
her
brother
,
with
whom
,
by
this
time
,
he
could
take
any
manner
of
freedom
,
did
not
scruple
to
damn
her
for
a
squinting
,
block
-
faced
,
chattering
piss
-
kitchen
;
and
immediately
after
drank
despair
to
all
old
maids
;
a
toast
which
Mr
Pickle
pledged
without
the
least
hesitation
,
and
next
day
intimated
to
his
sister
,
who
bore
the
indignity
with
surprising
resignation
,
and
did
not
therefore
desist
from
her
scheme
,
unpromising
as
it
seemed
to
be
,
until
her
attention
was
called
off
,
and
engaged
in
another
care
,
which
,
for
some
time
,
interrupted
the
progress
of
this
design
.
<EOS>
Her
sister
had
not
been
married
many
months
,
when
she
exhibited
evident
symptoms
of
pregnancy
,
to
the
general
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
,
and
the
inexpressible
joy
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
(
as
we
have
already
hinted
)
was
more
interested
in
the
preservation
of
the
family
-
name
,
than
in
any
other
consideration
whatever
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
no
sooner
discovered
appearances
to
justify
and
confirm
her
hopes
,
than
postponing
her
own
purpose
,
and
laying
aside
that
pique
and
resentment
she
had
conceived
from
the
behaviour
of
Mrs
Pickle
<EOS>
,
when
she
superseded
her
authority
;
or
perhaps
,
considering
her
in
no
other
light
than
that
of
the
vehicle
which
contained
,
and
was
destined
to
convey
her
brother
's
heir
to
light
,
she
determined
to
exert
her
uttermost
most
in
nursing
,
tending
,
and
cherishing
her
,
during
the
term
of
her
important
charge
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
she
purchased
Culpepper
's
midwifery
,
which
,
with
that
sagacious
performance
dignified
with
Aristotle
's
name
,
she
studied
with
indefatigable
care
,
and
diligently
perused
the
Compleat
House
-
wife
,
together
with
Quincy
's
dispensatory
,
culling
every
jelly
,
marmalade
and
conserve
which
these
authors
recommend
as
either
salutary
or
toothsome
,
for
the
benefit
and
comfort
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
during
her
gestation
.
<EOS>
She
restricted
her
from
eating
roots
,
pot
-
herbs
,
fruit
,
and
all
sort
of
vegetables
;
and
one
day
when
Mrs
Pickle
had
plucked
a
peach
with
her
own
hand
,
and
was
in
the
very
act
of
putting
it
between
her
teeth
,
Mrs
Grizzle
perceived
the
rash
attempt
,
and
running
up
to
her
,
fell
upon
her
knees
in
the
garden
,
intreating
her
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
to
resist
such
a
pernicious
appetite
.
<EOS>
Her
request
was
no
sooner
complied
with
,
than
recollecting
that
if
her
sister
's
longing
was
baulked
,
the
child
might
be
affected
with
some
disagreeable
mark
,
or
deplorable
disease
,
she
begged
as
earnestly
that
she
would
swallow
the
fruit
,
and
in
the
mean
time
ran
for
some
cordial
water
of
her
own
composing
,
which
she
forced
upon
her
sister
,
as
an
antidote
to
the
poison
she
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
This
excessive
zeal
and
tenderness
did
not
fail
to
be
very
troublesome
to
Mrs
Pickle
,
who
having
revolved
divers
plans
for
the
recovery
of
her
own
ease
,
at
length
determined
to
engage
Mrs
Grizzle
in
such
employment
as
would
interrupt
that
close
attendance
which
she
found
so
teizing
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
Neither
did
she
wait
long
for
an
opportunity
of
putting
her
resolution
in
practice
.
    
<EOS>
The
very
next
day
,
a
gentleman
happening
to
dine
with
Mr
Pickle
,
unfortunately
mentioned
a
pine
-
apple
,
part
of
which
he
had
eaten
a
week
before
at
the
house
of
a
nobleman
who
lived
in
another
part
of
the
country
,
at
the
distance
of
an
hundred
miles
at
least
.
    
<EOS>
The
name
of
this
fatal
fruit
was
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
incessantly
watched
her
sister
's
looks
,
took
the
alarm
,
because
she
thought
they
gave
certain
indications
of
curiosity
and
desire
;
and
after
having
observed
that
she
herself
never
could
eat
pine
-
apples
,
which
were
altogether
unnatural
productions
,
extorted
by
the
force
of
artificial
fire
,
out
of
filthy
manure
,
asked
with
a
faultering
voice
,
if
Mrs
Pickle
was
not
of
her
way
of
thinking
?
<EOS>
This
young
lady
,
who
wanted
neither
slyness
nor
penetration
,
at
once
divined
her
meaning
,
and
replied
with
seeming
unconcern
,
that
for
her
own
part
she
should
never
repine
,
if
there
was
not
a
pine
-
apple
in
the
universe
,
provided
she
could
indulge
herself
with
the
fruits
of
her
own
country
.
    
<EOS>
This
answer
,
which
was
calculated
for
the
benefit
of
the
stranger
,
who
would
certainly
have
suffered
for
his
imprudence
by
the
resentment
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
had
her
sister
expressed
the
least
relish
for
the
fruit
in
question
:
I
say
,
this
answer
had
the
desired
effect
,
and
re
-
established
the
peace
of
the
company
,
which
was
not
a
little
endangered
by
the
gentleman
's
want
of
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
however
,
after
breakfast
,
the
pregnant
lady
,
in
pursuance
of
her
plan
,
yawned
(
as
it
were
by
accident
)
full
in
the
face
of
her
maiden
sister
,
who
being
infinitely
disturbed
by
this
convulsion
,
affirmed
it
was
a
symptom
of
longing
;
and
insisted
upon
knowing
the
object
in
desire
,
when
Mrs
Pickle
affecting
an
affected
smile
,
told
her
she
had
eaten
a
most
delicious
pine
-
apple
in
her
sleep
.
<EOS>
This
declaration
was
attended
with
an
immediate
scream
uttered
by
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
instantly
perceiving
her
sister
surprized
at
the
exclamation
,
clasped
her
in
her
arms
,
and
assured
her
,
with
a
sort
of
hysterical
laugh
,
importing
horror
rather
than
delight
,
that
she
could
not
help
screaming
with
joy
,
because
she
had
it
in
her
power
to
gratify
her
dear
sister
's
wish
;
a
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
having
promised
to
send
her
,
in
a
present
,
a
couple
of
fine
pine
-
apples
,
which
she
would
that
very
day
go
in
quest
of
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Pickle
would
by
no
means
consent
to
this
proposal
,
on
pretence
of
sparing
the
other
unnecessary
fatigue
;
and
assured
her
,
that
,
if
she
had
any
desire
to
eat
a
pine
-
apple
,
it
was
so
faint
,
that
the
disappointment
could
produce
no
bad
consequence
.
<EOS>
But
this
assurance
was
conveyed
in
a
manner
(
which
she
knew
very
well
how
to
adopt
)
that
instead
of
dissuading
,
rather
stimulated
Mrs
Grizzle
to
set
out
immediately
,
not
on
a
visit
to
that
lady
,
whose
promise
she
herself
had
feigned
with
a
view
of
consulting
her
sister
's
tranquillity
,
but
on
a
random
search
thro
'
the
whole
county
for
this
unlucky
fruit
,
which
was
like
to
produce
so
much
vexation
and
prejudice
to
her
and
her
father
's
house
.
    
<EOS>
During
three
whole
days
and
nights
,
did
she
,
attended
by
a
valet
,
ride
from
place
to
place
without
success
,
unmindful
of
her
health
,
and
careless
of
her
reputation
,
that
began
to
suffer
from
the
nature
of
her
inquiry
,
which
was
pursued
with
such
peculiar
eagerness
and
distraction
,
that
every
body
with
whom
she
conversed
,
looked
upon
her
as
an
unhappy
person
,
whose
intellects
were
not
a
little
disordered
.
    
<EOS>
Baffled
in
all
her
researches
within
the
county
,
she
at
length
resolved
to
visit
that
very
nobleman
,
at
whose
house
the
officious
stranger
had
been
(
for
her
)
so
unfortunately
regaled
,
and
actually
arrived
in
a
post
-
chaise
at
the
place
of
his
habitation
,
where
she
introduced
her
business
as
an
affair
on
which
the
happiness
of
a
whole
family
depended
.
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
she
had
come
too
late
;
his
lordship
lamented
,
in
very
polite
and
pathetic
terms
,
that
he
was
disabled
from
exerting
his
humanity
,
and
enjoying
the
pleasure
<EOS>
he
should
feel
in
contributing
to
the
happiness
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
,
at
such
an
easy
rate
;
telling
her
,
that
he
had
unluckily
,
the
very
day
before
,
sent
the
two
last
pine
-
apples
his
garden
had
produced
,
in
a
present
to
a
certain
lady
in
the
neighbourhood
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
was
so
affected
with
this
explanation
,
that
she
fainted
away
,
and
was
immediately
carried
to
the
public
house
,
where
she
had
left
her
horses
,
and
where
she
remained
inconsolable
for
the
disappointment
,
which
in
all
likelihood
would
have
proved
more
fatal
to
her
than
to
the
person
for
whom
she
was
so
piously
concerned
,
had
not
she
in
the
evening
,
by
the
medium
of
her
own
servant
,
received
a
hint
from
the
nobleman
's
gardener
,
that
for
five
pieces
she
should
be
furnished
with
a
couple
of
as
fine
apples
as
ever
were
seen
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
terms
(
I
scarce
need
say
)
were
greedily
embraced
,
the
fruit
secured
in
her
possession
;
and
she
departed
that
very
night
on
her
return
to
her
brother
's
house
,
where
she
safely
arrived
with
her
acquisition
,
and
was
most
cordially
received
by
her
sister
,
who
had
been
under
some
apprehensions
on
her
account
.
    
<EOS>
Neither
was
his
lordship
forgotten
in
Mrs
Grizzle
's
benediction
,
when
she
understood
from
the
valet
who
accompanied
her
,
that
he
had
,
with
his
own
eyes
,
seen
above
an
hundred
pine
-
apples
ripe
for
cutting
in
his
garden
the
evening
of
that
very
day
on
which
he
had
assured
her
that
there
was
not
one
left
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
VI
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
is
indefatigable
in
gratifying
her
sister
's
longings
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
is
born
,
and
managed
contrary
to
the
directions
and
remonstrances
of
his
aunt
,
who
is
disgusted
upon
that
account
;
and
resumes
the
plan
which
she
had
before
rejected
.
   
<EOS>
The
success
of
this
device
would
have
encouraged
Mrs
Pickle
to
practise
more
of
the
same
sort
upon
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
had
she
not
been
deterred
by
a
violent
fever
which
seized
her
zealous
ally
,
in
consequence
of
the
fatigue
and
uneasiness
she
had
undergone
;
which
,
while
it
lasted
,
as
effectually
conduced
to
her
repose
,
as
any
other
stratagem
she
could
invent
.
    
<EOS>
But
Mrs
Grizzle
's
health
was
no
sooner
restored
,
than
the
other
being
as
much
incommoded
as
ever
,
was
obliged
,
in
her
own
defence
,
to
have
recourse
to
some
other
contrivance
;
and
managed
her
artifices
in
such
a
manner
,
as
leaves
it
at
this
day
a
doubt
whether
she
was
really
so
whimsical
and
capricious
in
her
appetites
as
she
herself
pretended
to
be
;
for
her
longings
were
not
restricted
to
the
demands
of
the
palate
and
stomach
,
but
also
affected
all
the
other
organs
of
sense
,
and
even
invaded
her
imagination
,
which
at
this
period
seemed
to
be
strangely
diseased
.
    
<EOS>
One
time
she
longed
to
pinch
her
husband
's
ear
;
and
it
was
with
infinite
difficulty
that
his
sister
could
prevail
upon
him
to
undergo
the
operation
.
<EOS>
Yet
this
task
was
easy
,
in
comparison
with
another
she
undertook
for
the
gratification
of
Mrs
Pickle
's
unaccountable
desire
;
which
was
no
other
than
to
persuade
the
commodore
to
submit
his
chin
to
the
mercy
of
the
big
-
bellied
lady
,
who
ardently
wished
for
an
opportunity
of
plucking
three
black
hairs
from
his
beard
.
<EOS>
When
this
proposal
was
first
communicated
to
Mr
Trunnion
by
the
husband
,
his
answer
was
nothing
but
a
dreadful
effusion
of
oaths
,
accompanied
with
such
a
stare
,
and
delivered
in
such
a
tone
of
voice
,
as
terrified
the
poor
beseecher
into
immediate
silence
;
so
that
Mrs
Grizzle
was
fain
to
take
the
whole
enterprize
upon
herself
,
and
next
day
went
to
the
garrison
accordingly
,
where
having
obtained
entrance
by
means
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
,
while
his
commander
was
asleep
,
ordered
her
to
be
admitted
for
the
joke
's
sake
,
she
waited
patiently
till
he
turned
out
,
and
then
accosted
him
in
the
yard
,
where
he
used
to
perform
his
morning
walk
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
thunder
-
struck
at
the
appearance
of
a
woman
in
a
place
which
he
had
hitherto
kept
sacred
from
the
whole
sex
,
and
immediately
began
to
utter
an
apostrophe
to
Tom
Pipes
,
whose
turn
it
was
then
to
watch
;
when
Mrs
Grizzle
falling
on
her
knees
before
him
,
conjured
him
with
many
pathetic
supplications
,
to
hear
and
grant
her
request
,
which
was
no
sooner
signified
,
than
he
bellowed
in
such
an
outragious
manner
,
that
the
whole
court
re
-
ecchoed
the
opprobrious
term
bitch
;
and
the
word
damnation
which
he
repeated
with
surprising
volubility
,
without
any
sort
of
propriety
or
connection
;
and
retreated
into
his
penetralia
,
leaving
the
baffled
devotee
in
the
humble
posture
she
had
so
unsuccessfully
chosen
to
melt
his
obdurate
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Mortifying
<EOS>
as
this
repulse
must
have
been
to
a
lady
of
her
stately
disposition
,
she
did
not
relinquish
her
aim
,
but
endeavoured
to
interest
the
commodore
's
counsellors
and
adherents
in
her
cause
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
she
sollicited
the
interest
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
being
highly
pleased
with
a
circumstance
in
all
probability
so
productive
of
mirth
and
diversion
,
readily
entered
into
her
measures
,
and
promised
to
employ
his
whole
influence
for
her
satisfaction
:
and
as
for
the
boatswain
's
mate
,
he
was
rendered
propitious
by
the
present
of
a
guinea
which
she
slipt
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mrs
Grizzle
was
continually
engaged
in
this
negotiation
for
the
space
of
ten
days
,
during
which
the
commodore
was
so
incessantly
pestered
with
her
remonstrances
,
and
the
admonitions
of
his
associates
,
that
he
swore
his
people
had
a
design
upon
his
life
,
which
becoming
a
burthen
to
him
,
he
at
last
complied
,
and
was
conducted
to
the
scene
like
a
victim
to
the
altar
,
by
the
exulting
priests
;
or
rather
growling
like
a
reluctant
bear
,
when
he
is
led
to
the
stake
amidst
the
shouts
and
cries
of
butchers
and
their
dogs
.
    
<EOS>
After
all
,
this
victory
was
not
quite
so
decisive
as
the
conquerors
imagined
;
for
the
patient
being
set
,
and
the
performer
prepared
with
a
pair
of
pincers
,
a
small
difficulty
occurred
:
<EOS>
she
could
not
for
some
time
discern
one
black
hair
on
the
whole
superficies
of
Mr
Trunnion
's
face
;
when
Mrs
Grizzle
,
very
much
alarmed
and
disconcerted
,
had
recourse
to
a
magnifying
glass
that
stood
upon
her
toilette
;
and
after
a
most
accurate
examination
,
discovered
a
fibre
of
a
dusky
hue
,
to
which
the
instrument
being
applied
,
Mrs
Pickle
pulled
it
up
by
the
roots
,
to
the
no
small
discomposure
of
the
owner
,
who
feeling
the
smart
much
more
severe
than
he
had
expected
,
started
up
,
and
swore
he
would
not
part
with
another
hair
to
save
them
all
from
damnation
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Hatchway
exhorted
him
to
patience
and
resignation
,
Mrs
Grizzle
repeated
her
intreaties
with
great
humility
;
but
finding
him
deaf
to
all
her
prayers
,
and
absolutely
bent
upon
leaving
the
house
,
she
clasped
his
knees
,
and
begged
for
the
love
of
God
that
he
would
have
compassion
upon
a
distressed
family
,
and
endure
a
little
more
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
infant
,
who
would
otherwise
be
born
with
a
grey
beard
upon
its
chin
.
<EOS>
Far
from
being
melted
,
he
was
rather
exasperated
by
this
reflection
;
to
which
he
replied
with
great
indignation
,
"
Damn
ye
for
a
yaw
-
sighted
bitch
!
<EOS>
he
'll
be
hanged
long
enough
before
he
has
any
beard
at
all
:
"
<EOS>
so
saying
,
he
disengaged
himself
from
her
embraces
,
flung
out
at
the
door
,
and
halted
homewards
with
such
surprising
speed
,
that
the
lieutenant
could
not
overtake
him
until
he
had
arrived
at
his
own
gate
;
and
Mrs
Grizzle
was
so
much
affected
with
his
escape
,
that
her
sister
,
in
pure
compassion
,
desired
she
would
not
afflict
herself
,
protesting
that
her
own
wish
was
already
gratified
,
for
she
had
plucked
three
hairs
at
once
,
having
from
the
beginning
been
dubious
of
the
commodore
's
forbearance
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
labours
of
this
assiduous
kinswoman
did
not
end
with
the
atchievement
of
this
adventure
:
her
eloquence
or
industry
were
employed
without
ceasing
,
in
the
performance
of
other
tasks
imposed
by
the
ingenious
craft
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
at
another
time
conceived
an
insuppressible
affection
for
a
fricassee
of
frogs
,
which
should
be
the
genuine
natives
of
France
;
so
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
dispatching
a
messenger
on
purpose
to
that
kingdom
:
<EOS>
but
as
she
could
not
depend
upon
the
integrity
of
any
common
servant
,
Mrs
Grizzle
undertook
that
province
,
and
actually
set
sail
in
a
cutter
for
Bologne
,
<EOS>
from
whence
she
returned
in
eight
and
forty
hours
with
a
tub
full
of
those
live
animals
,
which
being
dressed
according
to
art
,
her
sister
would
not
taste
them
,
on
pretence
that
her
fit
of
longing
was
past
:
but
then
her
inclinations
took
a
different
turn
,
and
fixed
themselves
upon
a
curious
implement
belonging
to
a
lady
of
quality
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
was
reported
to
be
a
very
great
curiosity
;
this
was
no
other
than
a
porcelain
chamber
-
pot
of
admirable
workmanship
,
contrived
by
the
honourable
owner
,
who
kept
it
for
her
own
private
use
,
and
cherished
it
as
an
utensil
of
inestimable
value
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
shuddered
at
the
first
hint
she
received
of
her
sister
's
desire
to
possess
this
piece
of
furniture
;
because
she
knew
it
was
not
to
be
purchased
;
and
the
lady
's
character
,
which
was
none
of
the
most
amiable
in
point
of
humanity
and
condescension
,
forbad
all
hopes
of
borrowing
it
for
a
season
;
she
therefore
attempted
to
reason
down
this
capricious
appetite
,
as
an
extravagance
of
imagination
which
ought
to
be
combated
and
repressed
;
and
Mrs
Pickle
,
to
all
appearance
,
was
convinced
and
satisfied
by
her
arguments
and
advice
:
but
nevertheless
,
could
make
use
of
no
other
convenience
,
and
was
threatened
with
a
very
dangerous
suppression
.
    
<EOS>
Rouzed
at
the
peril
in
which
she
supposed
her
to
be
,
Mrs
Grizzle
flew
to
the
lady
's
house
,
and
having
obtained
a
private
audience
,
disclosed
the
melancholy
situation
of
her
sister
,
and
implored
the
benevolence
of
her
ladyship
,
who
,
contrary
to
expectation
,
received
her
very
graciously
,
and
consented
to
indulge
Mrs
Pickle
's
longing
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
had
not
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
the
family
,
she
hoped
it
would
not
be
taken
amiss
,
if
she
insisted
upon
security
for
her
own
indemnification
,
in
case
any
accident
should
happen
to
the
machine
while
under
their
protection
.
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
this
condescension
,
Mrs
Grizzle
was
loud
in
her
acknowledgments
,
embraced
the
terms
of
the
loan
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
an
hundred
guineas
were
deposited
,
and
brought
home
this
illustrious
Jordan
,
with
as
much
pleasure
and
satisfaction
,
as
the
Argonauts
enjoyed
when
they
made
themselves
masters
of
the
golden
fleece
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
her
success
was
attended
with
a
small
disaster
,
which
she
could
not
possibly
foresee
:
next
day
it
was
,
at
the
desire
of
Mrs
Pickle
,
committed
to
the
charge
of
a
trusty
servant
,
who
,
in
carrying
it
back
to
the
right
owner
,
had
the
misfortune
to
be
overturned
by
one
of
her
ladyship
's
valets
who
ran
against
him
in
the
court
;
and
this
superb
piece
of
porcelain
falling
upon
the
pavement
,
was
dashed
into
a
thousand
pieces
.
<EOS>
In
vain
did
the
poor
carrier
urge
his
own
innocence
,
by
representing
the
true
cause
of
this
misadventure
;
her
ladyship
was
deaf
to
all
his
proofs
and
protestations
,
and
without
any
ceremony
,
detained
the
pledge
which
had
been
left
in
her
hands
;
not
without
violent
suspicion
of
having
acted
as
the
auxiliary
of
chance
,
to
which
this
calamity
was
imputed
.
    
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
will
,
Mr
Pickle
began
to
be
out
of
humour
at
the
expence
to
which
he
was
exposed
by
the
caprice
of
his
wife
,
who
was
herself
alarmed
at
this
last
accident
,
and
for
the
future
kept
her
fancy
within
bounds
,
insomuch
,
that
without
being
subject
to
any
more
extraordinary
trouble
,
Mrs
Grizzle
reaped
the
long
wished
fruits
of
her
dearest
expectation
in
the
birth
of
a
fine
boy
,
whom
her
sister
in
a
few
months
brought
into
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
omit
the
description
of
the
rejoicings
,
which
were
infinite
on
this
important
occasion
,
and
only
observe
that
Mrs
Pickle
's
mother
and
aunt
stood
godmothers
,
and
the
commodore
assisted
at
the
ceremony
as
godfather
to
the
child
,
who
was
christened
by
the
name
of
Peregrine
,
in
compliment
to
the
memory
of
a
deceased
uncle
.
<EOS>
While
the
mother
was
confined
to
her
bed
,
and
incapable
of
maintaining
her
own
authority
,
Mrs
Grizzle
took
charge
of
the
infant
by
a
double
claim
;
and
superintended
with
surprizing
vigilance
the
nurse
and
midwife
in
all
the
particulars
of
their
respective
offices
,
which
were
performed
by
her
express
direction
.
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
was
Mrs
Pickle
in
a
condition
to
re
-
assume
the
management
of
her
own
affairs
,
than
she
thought
proper
to
alter
certain
regulations
concerning
the
child
,
which
had
obtained
in
consequence
of
her
sister
's
orders
,
directing
,
among
other
innovations
,
that
the
bandages
with
which
the
infant
had
been
so
neatly
rolled
up
,
like
an
Aegyptian
mummy
,
should
be
loosened
and
laid
aside
,
in
order
to
rid
nature
of
all
restraint
,
and
give
the
blood
free
scope
to
circulate
;
and
with
her
own
hands
she
plunged
him
headlong
every
morning
in
a
tub
-
full
of
cold
water
.
    
<EOS>
This
operation
seemed
so
barbarous
to
the
tender
-
hearted
Mrs
Grizzle
,
that
she
not
only
opposed
it
with
all
her
eloquence
,
shedding
abundance
of
tears
over
the
sacrifice
when
it
was
made
;
but
took
horse
immediately
,
and
departed
for
the
habitation
of
an
eminent
country
physician
,
whom
she
consulted
in
these
words
.
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
doctor
,
is
it
not
both
dangerous
and
cruel
to
be
the
means
of
letting
a
poor
tender
infant
perish
,
by
sousing
it
in
water
as
cold
as
ice
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
replied
the
doctor
,
downright
murder
,
I
affirm
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
see
you
are
a
person
of
great
learning
and
sagacity
,
said
the
other
;
and
I
must
beg
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
signify
your
opinion
in
your
own
hand
-
writing
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
doctor
immediately
complied
with
her
request
,
and
expressed
himself
upon
a
slip
of
paper
to
this
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
These
are
to
certify
whom
it
may
concern
,
that
I
firmly
believe
,
and
it
is
my
unalterable
opinion
,
that
whosoever
letteth
an
infant
perish
,
by
sousing
it
in
cold
water
,
even
though
the
said
water
should
not
be
so
cold
as
ice
,
is
in
effect
,
guilty
of
the
murder
of
the
said
infant
,
as
witness
my
hand
 
Comfit
Colocynth
.
    
<EOS>
Having
obtained
this
certificate
,
for
which
the
physician
was
handsomely
acknowledged
,
she
returned
in
triumph
,
hoping
,
with
such
authority
,
to
overthrow
all
opposition
;
and
accordingly
next
morning
,
when
her
nephew
was
about
to
undergo
his
diurnal
baptism
,
produced
the
commission
,
whereby
she
conceived
herself
impowered
to
overrule
such
inhuman
proceedings
.
    
<EOS>
But
she
was
disappointed
in
her
expectation
,
confident
as
it
was
;
not
that
Mrs
Pickle
pretended
to
differ
in
opinion
from
Dr
Colocynth
,
"
for
whose
character
and
sentiments
<EOS>
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
I
have
such
veneration
,
that
I
shall
carefully
observe
the
caution
implied
in
this
very
certificate
,
by
which
,
far
from
condemning
my
method
of
practice
,
he
only
asserts
that
killing
is
murder
;
an
asseveration
,
the
truth
of
which
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
I
shall
never
dispute
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
,
sooth
to
say
,
had
rather
too
superficially
considered
the
clause
by
which
she
thought
herself
authorized
,
perused
the
paper
with
more
accuracy
,
and
was
confounded
at
her
own
want
of
penetration
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
though
she
was
confuted
,
she
was
by
no
means
convinced
that
her
objections
to
the
cold
bath
were
unreasonable
;
on
the
contrary
,
after
having
bestowed
sundry
opprobrious
epithets
on
the
physician
,
for
his
want
of
knowledge
and
candour
,
she
protested
in
the
most
earnest
and
solemn
manner
against
the
pernicious
practice
of
dipping
the
child
;
a
piece
of
cruelty
,
which
with
God
's
assistance
,
she
should
never
suffer
to
be
inflicted
on
her
own
issue
;
and
washing
her
hands
of
the
melancholy
consequence
that
would
certainly
ensue
,
shut
herself
up
in
her
closet
,
to
indulge
her
sorrow
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
She
was
deceived
,
however
,
in
her
prognostic
;
the
boy
,
instead
of
declining
in
point
of
health
,
seemed
to
acquire
fresh
vigour
from
every
plunge
,
as
if
he
had
been
resolved
to
discredit
the
wisdom
and
foresight
of
his
aunt
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
could
never
forgive
him
for
this
want
of
reverence
and
respect
.
<EOS>
This
conjecture
is
founded
upon
her
behaviour
to
him
in
the
sequel
of
his
infancy
,
during
which
she
was
known
to
torture
him
more
than
once
,
when
she
had
opportunities
of
thrusting
pins
into
his
flesh
,
without
any
danger
of
being
detected
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
her
affections
were
in
a
little
time
altogether
alienated
from
this
hope
of
her
family
,
whom
she
abandoned
to
the
conduct
of
his
mother
,
whose
province
it
undoubtedly
was
to
manage
the
nature
of
her
own
child
;
while
she
herself
resumed
her
operations
upon
the
commodore
,
whom
she
was
resolved
at
any
rate
to
captivate
and
inslave
.
<EOS>
And
it
must
be
owned
,
that
Mrs
Grizzle
's
knowledge
of
the
human
heart
never
shone
so
conspicuous
as
in
the
methods
she
pursued
for
the
accomplishment
of
this
important
aim
.
    
<EOS>
Through
the
rough
unpolished
husk
that
cased
the
soul
of
Trunnion
,
she
could
easily
distinguish
a
large
share
of
that
vanity
and
self
-
conceit
that
generally
predominate
even
in
the
most
savage
breast
;
and
to
this
she
constantly
appealed
.
<EOS>
In
his
presence
she
always
exclaimed
against
the
craft
and
dishonest
dissimulation
of
the
world
;
and
never
failed
of
uttering
particular
invectives
against
those
arts
of
chicanry
,
in
which
the
lawyers
are
so
conversant
to
the
prejudice
and
ruin
of
their
fellow
creatures
:
observing
that
in
a
sea
-
faring
life
,
so
far
as
she
had
opportunities
of
judging
or
being
informed
,
there
was
nothing
but
friendship
,
sincerity
,
and
a
hearty
contempt
for
every
thing
that
was
mean
or
selfish
.
    
<EOS>
This
kind
of
conversation
,
with
the
assistance
of
certain
particular
civilities
,
insensibly
made
an
impression
on
the
mind
of
the
commodore
;
and
that
the
more
effectual
,
as
his
former
prepossessions
were
built
upon
very
slender
foundations
:
his
antipathy
to
old
maids
,
which
he
had
conceived
upon
hearsay
,
began
gradually
to
diminish
,
when
he
found
they
were
not
quite
such
infernal
animals
as
they
had
been
represented
;
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
was
heard
to
observe
at
the
club
,
that
Pickle
's
sister
had
not
so
much
of
the
core
of
bitch
in
her
as
he
had
imagined
.
    
<EOS>
This
negative
compliment
,
by
the
medium
of
her
brother
,
soon
reached
the
ears
of
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
thus
encouraged
,
redoubled
all
her
arts
and
attention
;
so
that
in
less
than
three
months
after
,
he
in
the
same
place
distinguished
her
with
the
epithet
of
a
damned
sensible
jade
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
taking
the
alarm
at
this
declaration
,
which
he
feared
foreboded
something
fatal
to
his
interest
,
told
his
commander
with
a
sneer
,
that
she
had
sense
enough
to
bring
him
to
,
under
her
stern
;
and
he
did
not
doubt
but
that
such
an
old
crazy
vessel
would
be
the
better
for
being
taken
in
tow
.
"
<EOS>
But
howsomever
,
added
this
arch
adviser
,
<EOS>
I
'd
have
you
take
care
of
your
upper
works
;
for
if
once
you
are
made
fast
to
her
poop
,
agad
!
<EOS>
she
'll
spank
it
away
,
and
make
every
beam
in
your
body
crack
with
straining
.
<EOS>
"
Our
she
-
projector
's
whole
plan
had
like
to
have
been
ruined
by
the
effect
which
this
malicious
hint
had
upon
Trunnion
,
whose
rage
and
suspicion
being
wakened
at
once
,
his
colour
changed
from
tawny
to
a
cadaverous
pale
,
and
then
shifting
to
a
deep
and
dusky
red
,
such
as
we
sometimes
observe
in
the
sky
when
it
is
replete
with
thunder
,
he
after
his

Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
every
morning
interrogated
her
brother
with
regard
to
the
subject
of
his
night
's
conversation
with
his
friends
,
soon
received
the
unwelcome
news
of
the
commodore
's
aversion
to
matrimony
;
and
justly
imputing
the
greatest
part
of
his
disgust
to
the
satyrical
insinuations
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
resolved
to
level
this
obstruction
to
her
success
,
and
actually
found
means
to
interest
him
in
her
scheme
.
<EOS>
She
had
indeed
,
on
some
occasions
,
a
particular
knack
at
making
converts
,
being
probably
not
unacquainted
with
that
grand
system
of
persuasion
,
which
is
adopted
by
the
greatest
personages
of
the
age
,
as
fraught
with
maxims
much
more
effectual
than
all
the
eloquence
of
Tully
or
Demosthenes
,
even
when
supported
by
the
demonstrations
of
truth
:
besides
,
Mr
Hatchway
's
fidelity
to
his
new
ally
,
was
confirmed
by
his
foreseeing
in
his
captain
's
marriage
an
infinite
fund
of
gratification
for
his
own
cynical
disposition
.
<EOS>
Thus
,
therefore
,
converted
and
properly
cautioned
,
he
for
the
future
suppressed
all
the
virulence
of
his
wit
against
the
matrimonial
state
;
and
as
he
knew
not
how
to
open
his
mouth
in
the
positive
praise
of
any
person
whatever
,
took
all
opportunities
of
excepting
Mrs
Grizzle
by
name
,
from
the
censures
he
liberally
bestowed
upon
the
rest
of
her
sex
.
<EOS>
"
She
is
not
a
drunkard
,
like
Nan
Castick
of
Deptford
,
he
would
say
;
nor
a
nincompoop
,
like
Peg
Simper
of
Woolwich
;
nor
a
brimstone
,
like
Kate
Coddle
of
Chatham
;
nor
a
shrew
,
like
Nell
Griffin
on
the
Point
Portsmouth
;
"
(
ladies
to
whom
at
different
times
,
they
had
both
paid
their
addresses
)
but
a
tight
,
good
humoured
sensible
wench
,
who
knows
very
well
how
to
box
her
compass
;
well
trimmed
aloft
,
and
well
sheathed
alow
,
with
a
good
commodity
under
her
hatches
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
commodore
at
first
imagined
this
commendation
was
ironical
,
but
hearing
it
repeated
again
and
again
,
was
filled
with
astonishment
at
this
surprising
change
in
the
lieutenant
's
behaviour
;
and
after
a
long
fit
of
musing
,
concluded
that
Hatchway
himself
harboured
a
matrimonial
design
on
the
person
of
Mrs
Grizzle
.
    
<EOS>
Pleased
with
this
conjecture
,
he
rallied
Jack
in
his
turn
,
and
one
night
toasted
her
health
as
a
compliment
to
his
passion
;
a
circumstance
which
the
lady
learning
next
day
by
the
usual
canal
of
her
intelligence
,
and
interpreting
as
the
result
of
his
own
tenderness
for
her
,
she
congratulated
herself
upon
the
victory
she
had
obtained
;
and
thinking
it
unnecessary
to
continue
the
reserve
she
had
hitherto
industriously
affected
,
resolved
from
that
day
to
sweeten
her
behaviour
towards
him
with
such
a
dash
of
affection
,
as
could
not
fail
to
persuade
him
that
he
had
inspired
her
with
a
reciprocal
flame
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
determination
he
was
invited
to
dinner
,
and
while
he
staid
,
treated
with
such
cloying
proofs
of
her
regard
,
that
not
only
the
rest
of
the
company
,
but
even
Trunnion
himself
perceived
her
drift
;
and
taking
the
alarm
accordingly
,
could
not
help
exclaiming
,
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
I
see
how
the
land
lies
,
and
if
I
do
n't
weather
the
point
,
I
'll
be
damn'd
.
<EOS>
"
Having
thus
expressed
himself
to
his
afflicted
inamorata
,
he
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
garrison
,
in
which
he
shut
himself
up
for
the
space
of
ten
days
,
and
had
no
communication
with
his
friends
and
domesticks
but
by
looks
,
which
were
most
significantly
picturesque
.

Chapter
VII
Divers
stratagems
are
invented
and
put
in
practice
,
in
order
to
overcome
the
obstinacy
of
Trunnion
,
who
at
length
is
teized
and
tortured
into
the
noose
of
wedlock
.
   
<EOS>
This
abrupt
departure
and
unkind
declaration
affected
Mrs
Grizzle
so
much
,
that
she
fell
sick
of
sorrow
and
mortification
;
and
after
having
confined
herself
to
her
bed
for
three
days
,
sent
for
her
brother
,
told
him
she
perceived
her
end
drawing
near
,
and
desired
that
a
lawyer
might
be
brought
,
in
order
to
write
her
last
will
.
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
surprised
at
her
demand
,
began
to
act
the
part
of
a
comforter
,
assuring
her
that
her
distemper
was
not
at
all
dangerous
;
and
that
he
would
instantly
send
for
a
physician
,
who
would
convince
her
that
she
was
in
no
manner
of
jeopardy
;
so
that
there
was
no
occasion
at
present
,
to
employ
any
officious
attorney
in
such
a
melancholy
task
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
this
affectionate
brother
was
of
opinion
that
a
will
was
altogether
superfluous
at
any
rate
,
as
he
himself
was
heir
at
law
to
his
sister
's
whole
real
and
personal
estate
.
<EOS>
But
she
insisted
upon
his
compliance
with
such
determined
obstinacy
,
that
he
could
no
longer
resist
her
importunities
;
and
a
scrivener
arriving
,
she
dictated
and
executed
her
will
,
in
which
she
bequeathed
to
commodore
Trunnion
one
thousand
pounds
,
to
purchase
a
mourning
ring
,
which
she
hoped
he
would
wear
as
a
pledge
of
her
friendship
and
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Her
brother
,
though
he
did
not
much
relish
this
testimony
of
her
love
,
nevertheless
that
same
evening
gave
an
account
of
this
particular
to
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
was
also
,
as
Mr
Pickle
assured
him
,
generously
remembered
by
the
testastrix
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
fraught
with
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
watched
for
an
opportunity
,
and
as
soon
as
he
perceived
the
commodore
's
features
a
little
unbended
from
that
ferocious
contraction
they
had
suffered
so
long
,
ventured
to
inform
him
that
Pickle
's
sister
lay
at
the
point
of
death
,
and
that
she
had
left
him
a
thousand
pounds
in
her
will
.
<EOS>
This
piece
of
news
overwhelmed
him
with
confusion
,
and
Mr
Hatchway
imputing
his
silence
to
remorse
,
resolved
to
take
advantage
of
that
favourable
moment
,
and
counselled
him
to
go
and
visit
the
poor
young
woman
,
who
was
dying
for
love
of
him
.
<EOS>
But
his
admonition
happened
to
be
somewhat
unseasonable
;
for
Trunnion
no
sooner
heard
him
mention
the
cause
of
her
disorder
than
his
morosity
recurring
,
he
burst
out
into
a
violent
fit
of
cursing
,
and
forthwith
betook
himself
again
to
his
hammock
,
where
he
lay
uttering
in
a
low
growling
tone
of
voice
,
a
repetition
of
oaths
and
imprecations
,
for
the
space
of
four
and
twenty
hours
,
without
ceasing
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
delicious
meal
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
eager
to
inhance
the
pleasure
of
the
entertainment
still
more
,
and
at
the
same
time
conduce
to
the
success
of
the
cause
he
had
espoused
,
invented
a
stratagem
,
the
execution
of
which
had
all
the
effect
he
could
desire
.
    
<EOS>
He
prevailed
upon
Pipes
,
who
was
devoted
to
his
service
,
to
get
upon
the
top
of
the
chimney
belonging
to
the
commodore
's
chamber
,
at
midnight
,
and
to
lower
down
by
a
rope
a
bunch
of
stinking
whitings
,
which
being
performed
,
he
put
a
speaking
-
trumpet
to
his
mouth
,
and
hollowed
down
the
vent
,
in
a
voice
like
thunder
,
"
Trunnion
!
<EOS>
Trunnion
!
<EOS>
turn
out
and
be
spliced
,
or
lie
still
and
be
damned
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
dreadful
note
,
the
terror
of
which
was
increased
by
the
silence
and
darkness
of
the
night
,
as
well
as
the
eccho
of
the
passage
through
which
it
was
conveyed
,
no
sooner
reached
the
ears
of
the
astonished
commodore
,
than
turning
his
eye
towards
the
place
from
whence
this
solemn
address
seemed
to
proceed
,
he
beheld
a
glittering
object
that
vanished
in
an
instant
;
and
just
as
his
superstitious
fear
had
improved
the
apparition
into
some
supernatural
messenger
cloathed
in
shining
array
,
his
opinion
was
confirmed
by
a
sudden
explosion
,
which
he
took
for
thunder
,
though
it
was
no
other
than
the
noise
of
a
pistol
fired
down
the
chimney
by
the
boatswain
's
mate
,
according
to
the
instructions
he
had
received
;
and
he
had
time
enough
to
descend
before
he
was
in
any
danger
of
being
detected
by
his
commander
,
who
could
not
for
a
whole
hour
recollect
himself
from
the
amazement
and
consternation
which
had
overpowered
his
faculties
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
got
up
and
rung
his
bell
with
great
agitation
.
<EOS>
He
repeated
the
summons
more
than
once
,
but
no
regard
being
paid
to
this
alarm
,
his
dread
returned
with
double
terror
,
a
cold
sweat
bedewed
his
limbs
,
his
knees
knocked
together
,
his
hair
bristled
up
,
and
the
remains
of
his
teeth
were
shattered
to
pieces
in
the
convulsive
vibrations
of
his
jaws
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
agony
he
made
one
desperate
effort
,
and
bursting
open
the
door
of
his
apartment
,
bolted
into
Hatchway
's
chamber
,
which
happened
to
be
on
the
same
floor
;
and
there
found
the
lieutenant
in
a
counterfeit
swoon
,
who
pretended
to
wake
from
his
trance
in
an
ejaculation
of
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
<EOS>
And
being
questioned
by
the
terrified
commodore
with
regard
to
what
had
happened
,
assured
him
he
had
heard
the
same
voice
and
clap
of
thunder
by
which
Trunnion
himself
had
been
discomposed
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
whose
turn
it
was
to
watch
,
concurred
in
giving
evidence
to
the
same
purpose
;
and
the
commodore
not
only
owned
that
he
had
heard
the
voice
,
but
likewise
communicated
his
vision
,
with
all
the
aggravation
which
his
disturbed
fancy
suggested
.
    
<EOS>
A
consultation
immediately
ensued
,
in
which
Mr
Hatchway
very
gravely
observed
,
that
the
finger
of
God
was
plainly
perceivable
in
those
signals
;
and
that
it
would
be
both
sinful
and
foolish
to
disregard
his
commands
,
especially
as
the
match
proposed
was
,
in
all
respects
,
more
advantageous
than
any
that
one
of
his
years
and
infirmities
could
reasonably
expect
;
declaring
that
for
his
own
part
he
would
not
endanger
his
soul
and
body
by
living
one
day
longer
under
the
same
roof
with
a
man
who
despised
the
holy
will
of
heaven
;
and
Tom
Pipes
adhered
to
the
same
pious
resolution
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
's
perseverance
could
not
resist
the
number
and
diversity
of
considerations
that
assaulted
it
;
he
revolved
in
silence
all
the
opposite
motives
that
occurred
to
his
reflection
;
and
after
having
been
,
to
all
appearance
,
bewildered
in
the
labyrinth
of
his
own
thoughts
,
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
,
and
heaving
a
piteous
groan
,
yielded
to
their
remonstrances
in
these
words
:
"
<EOS>
Well
,
since
it
must
be
so
<EOS>
,
I
think
we
must
e'en
grapple
.
    
<EOS>
But
damn
my
eyes
!
'
<EOS>
tis
a
damn'd
hard
case
that
a
fellow
of
my
years
should
be
compelled
,
d'ye
see
,
to
beat
up
to
windward
all
the
rest
of
his
life
,
against
the
current
of
his
own
inclination
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
important
article
being
discussed
,
Mr
Hatchway
set
out
in
the
morning
to
visit
the
despairing
shepherdess
,
and
was
handsomely
rewarded
for
the
enlivening
tidings
with
which
he
blessed
her
ears
.
<EOS>
Sick
as
she
was
,
she
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
the
contrivance
,
in
consequence
of
which
her
swain
's
ascent
had
been
obtained
,
and
gave
the
lieutenant
ten
guineas
for
Tom
Pipes
,
in
consideration
of
the
part
he
acted
in
the
farce
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
the
commodore
suffered
himself
to
be
conveyed
to
her
apartment
,
like
a
felon
to
execution
,
and
was
received
by
her
in
a
languishing
manner
and
genteel
dishabille
,
accompanied
by
her
sister
-
in
law
;
who
was
,
for
very
obvious
reasons
,
extremely
sollicitous
about
her
success
.
<EOS>
Though
the
lieutenant
had
tutored
him
touching
his
behaviour
at
this
interview
,
he
made
a
thousand
wry
faces
before
he
could
pronounce
the
simple
salutation
of
How
d'ye
?
<EOS>
to
his
mistress
;
and
after
his
counsellor
had
urged
him
with
twenty
or
thirty
whispers
,
to
each
of
which
he
had
replied
aloud
,
"
Damn
your
eyes
I
wo
n't
,
"
he
got
up
,
and
halting
towards
the
couch
on
which
Mrs
Grizzle
reclined
in
a
state
of
strange
expectation
,
he
seized
her
hand
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
;
but
this
piece
of
gallantry
he
performed
in
such
a
reluctant
,
uncouth
,
indignant
manner
,
that
the
nymph
had
need
of
all
her
resolution
to
endure
the
compliment
without
shrinking
;
and
he
himself
was
so
disconcerted
at
what
he
had
done
,
that
he
instantly
retired
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
where
he
sat
silent
,
and
broiled
with
shame
and
vexation
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Pickle
,
like
a
sensible
matron
,
quitted
the
place
,
on
pretence
of
going
to
the
nursery
;
and
Mr
Hatchway
taking
the
hint
,
recollected
that
he
had
lest
his
tobacco
pouch
in
the
parlour
,
whither
he
immediately
descended
,
leaving
the
two
lovers
to
their
mutual
endearments
.
<EOS>
Never
had
the
commodore
found
himself
in
such
a
disagreeable
dilemma
before
.
<EOS>
He
sat
in
an
agony
of
suspence
,
as
if
he
every
moment
dreaded
the
dissolution
of
nature
;
and
the
imploring
sighs
of
his
future
bride
added
,
if
possible
,
to
the
pangs
of
his
distress
.
<EOS>
Impatient
of
his
situation
,
he
rolled
his
eye
around
in
quest
of
some
relief
,
and
unable
to
contain
himself
,
exclaimed
,
"
Damnation
seize
the
fellow
and
his
pouch
too
!
<EOS>
I
believe
he
had
sheered
off
,
and
left
me
here
in
the
stays
.
<EOS>
"
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
could
not
help
taking
some
notice
of
this
manifestation
of
chagrin
,
lamented
her
unhappy
fate
in
being
so
disagreeable
to
him
that
he
could
not
put
up
with
her
company
for
a
few
moments
without
repining
;
and
began
in
very
tender
terms
to
reproach
him
with
his
inhumanity
and
indifference
.
<EOS>
To
this
expostulation
he
replied
,
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
what
would
the
woman
have
?
<EOS>
let
the
parson
do
his
office
when
he
wool
,
here
I
am
ready
to
be
reeved
in
the
matrimonial
block
,
d'ye
see
,
and
damn
all
nonsensical
palaver
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
retreated
,
leaving
his
mistress
not
at
all
disobliged
at
his
plain
-
dealing
.
<EOS>
That
same
evening
the
treaty
of
marriage
was
brought
upon
the
carpet
,
and
by
means
of
Mr
Pickle
and
the
lieutenant
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
,
without
the
intervention
of
lawyers
,
whom
Mr
Trunnion
expressly
excluded
from
all
share
in
the
business
;
making
that
condition
the
indispensible
preliminary
of
the
whole
agreement
.
    
<EOS>
Things
being
brought
to
this
bearing
,
Mrs
Grizzle
's
heart
dilated
with
joy
;
her
health
,
which
by
the
bye
was
never
dangerously
impaired
,
she
recovered
as
if
by
inchantment
,
and
a
day
being
fixed
for
the
nuptials
,
employed
the
short
period
of
her
celibacy
in
choosing
ornaments
for
the
celebration
of
her
entrance
into
the
married
state
.

Chapter
VIII
Preparations
are
made
for
the
commodore
's
wedding
,
which
is
delayed
by
an
accident
that
hurried
him
the
Lord
knows
whither
.
   
<EOS>
The
fame
of
this
extraordinary
conjunction
spread
all
over
the
county
;
and
on
the
day
appointed
for
their
spousals
,
the
church
was
surrounded
by
an
inconceivable
multitude
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
to
give
a
specimen
of
his
gallantry
,
by
the
advice
of
his
friend
Hatchway
,
resolved
to
appear
on
horseback
on
the
grand
occasion
,
at
the
head
of
all
his
male
attendants
,
whom
he
had
rigged
with
the
white
shirts
and
black
caps
formerly
belonging
to
his
barge
's
crew
;
and
he
bought
a
couple
of
hunters
for
the
accommodation
of
himself
and
his
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
With
this
equipage
then
he
set
out
from
the
garrison
for
the
church
,
after
having
dispatched
a
messenger
to
apprize
the
bride
that
he
and
his
company
were
mounted
;
whereupon
she
got
immediately
into
the
coach
,
accompanied
by
her
brother
and
his
wife
,
and
drove
directly
to
the
place
of
assignation
,
where
several
pews
were
demolished
,
and
divers
persons
almost
pressed
to
death
,
by
the
eagerness
of
the
crowd
that
broke
in
to
see
the
ceremony
performed
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
arrived
at
the
altar
,
and
the
priest
in
attendance
,
they
waited
a
whole
half
hour
for
the
commodore
,
at
whose
slowness
they
began
to
be
under
some
apprehension
,
and
accordingly
dismissed
a
servant
to
quicken
his
pace
.
<EOS>
The
valet
having
rode
something
more
than
a
mile
,
espied
the
whole
troop
disposed
in
a
long
field
,
crossing
the
road
obliquely
,
and
headed
by
the
bridegroom
and
his
friend
Hatchway
,
who
finding
himself
hindered
by
a
hedge
from
proceeding
farther
in
the
same
direction
,
fired
a
pistol
,
and
stood
over
to
the
other
side
,
making
an
obtuse
angle
with
the
line
of
his
former
course
;
and
the
rest
of
the
squadron
followed
his
example
,
keeping
always
in
the
rear
of
each
other
,
like
a
flight
of
wild
geese
.
    
<EOS>
Surprized
at
this
strange
method
of
journeying
,
the
messenger
came
up
,
and
told
the
commodore
that
his
lady
and
her
company
expected
him
in
the
church
,
where
they
had
tarried
a
considerable
time
,
and
were
beginning
to
be
very
uneasy
at
his
delay
;
and
therefore
desired
he
would
proceed
with
more
expedition
.
<EOS>
To
this
message
Mr
Trunnion
replied
,
"
Hark
ye
,
brother
,
<EOS>
do
n't
you
see
we
make
all
possible
speed
?
<EOS>
go
back
and
tell
those
who
sent
you
,
that
the
wind
has
shifted
since
we
weighed
anchor
,
and
that
we
are
obliged
to
make
very
short
trips
in
tacking
,
by
reason
of
the
narrowness
of
the
channel
;
and
that
as
we
lie
within
six
points
of
the
wind
,
they
must
make
some
allowance
for
variation
and
leeway
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
,
Sir
!
said
the
valet
<EOS>
,
what
occasion
have
you
to
go
zig
zag
in
that
manner
?
<EOS>
Do
but
clap
spurs
to
your
horses
,
and
ride
straight
forward
,
and
<EOS>
I
'll
engage
you
shall
be
at
the
church
porch
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
right
in
the
wind
's
eye
?
<EOS>
answered
the
commander
,
ahey
!
<EOS>
brother
,
where
did
you
learn
your
navigation
?
    
<EOS>
Hawser
Trunnion
is
not
to
be
taught
at
this
time
of
day
how
to
lie
his
course
,
or
keep
his
own
reckoning
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
you
,
brother
,
you
know
best
the
trim
of
your
own
frigate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
courier
finding
he
had
to
do
with
people
who
would
not
be
easily
persuaded
out
of
their
own
opinions
,
returned
to
the
temple
,
and
made
a
report
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
,
to
the
no
small
consolation
of
the
bride
,
who
had
begun
to
discover
some
signs
of
disquiet
.
<EOS>
Composed
,
however
,
by
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
she
exerted
her
patience
for
the
space
of
another
half
hour
,
during
which
period
seeing
no
bridegroom
arrive
,
she
was
exceedingly
alarmed
;
so
that
all
the
spectators
could
easily
perceive
her
perturbation
,
which
manifested
itself
in
frequent
palpitations
,
heart
-
heavings
,
and
alterations
of
countenance
,
in
spite
of
the
assistance
of
a
smelling
-
bottle
which
she
incessantly
applied
to
her
nostrils
.
    
<EOS>
Various
were
the
conjectures
of
the
company
on
this
occasion
:
some
imagined
he
had
mistaken
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
as
he
had
never
been
at
church
since
he
first
settled
in
that
parish
;
others
believed
he
had
met
with
some
accident
,
in
consequence
of
which
his
attendants
had
carried
him
back
to
his
own
house
;
and
a
third
set
,
in
which
the
bride
herself
was
thought
to
be
comprehended
,
could
not
help
suspecting
that
the
commodore
had
changed
his
mind
.
    
<EOS>
But
all
these
suppositions
,
ingenious
as
they
were
,
happened
to
be
wide
of
the
true
cause
that
detained
him
,
which
was
no
other
than
this
:
the
commodore
and
his
crew
had
by
dint
of
turning
,
almost
weathered
the
parson
's
house
that
stood
to
windward
of
the
church
,
when
the
notes
of
a
pack
of
hounds
unluckily
reached
the
ears
of
the
two
hunters
which
Trunnion
and
the
lieutenant
bestrode
.
<EOS>
These
fleet
animals
no
sooner
heard
the
enlivening
sound
,
than
eager
for
the
chace
they
sprung
away
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
straining
every
nerve
to
partake
of
the
sport
,
flew
across
the
fields
with
incredible
speed
,
overleaping
hedges
and
ditches
,
and
every
thing
in
their
way
,
without
the
least
regard
to
their
unfortunate
riders
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
whose
steed
had
got
the
heels
of
the
other
,
finding
it
would
be
great
folly
and
presumption
in
him
to
pretend
to
keep
the
saddle
with
his
wooden
leg
,
very
wisely
took
the
opportunity
of
throwing
himself
off
in
his
passage
through
a
field
of
rich
clover
,
among
which
he
lay
at
his
ease
;
and
seeing
his
captain
advancing
at
full
gallop
,
hailed
him
with
the
salutation
of
"
What
chear
?
<EOS>
ho
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
who
was
in
infinite
distress
,
eying
him
askance
,
as
he
passed
,
replied
with
a
faultering
voice
,
"
O
damn
ye
!
<EOS>
you
are
safe
at
an
anchor
;
I
wish
to
God
I
were
as
fast
moored
.
"
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
conscious
of
his
disabled
heel
,
he
would
not
venture
to
try
the
same
experiment
which
had
succeeded
so
well
with
Hatchway
,
but
resolved
to
stick
as
close
as
possible
to
his
horse
's
back
,
until
providence
should
interpose
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
dropped
his
whip
,
and
with
his
right
hand
laid
fast
hold
on
the
pummel
,
contracting
every
muscle
in
his
body
to
secure
himself
in
the
seat
,
and
grinning
most
formidably
,
in
consequence
of
this
exertion
.
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
he
was
hurried
on
a
considerable
way
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
his
view
was
comforted
by
a
five
bar
gate
that
appeared
before
him
,
as
he
never
doubted
that
there
the
career
of
his
hunter
must
necessarily
end
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
alas
!
<EOS>
he
reckoned
without
his
host
;
far
from
halting
at
this
obstruction
,
the
horse
sprung
over
it
with
amazing
agility
,
to
the
utter
confusion
and
disorder
of
his
owner
,
who
lost
his
hat
and
periwig
in
the
leap
,
and
now
began
to
think
in
good
earnest
,
that
he
was
actually
mounted
on
the
back
of
the
devil
.
<EOS>
He
recommended
himself
to
God
,
his
reflection
forsook
him
,
his
eye
-
sight
and
all
his
other
senses
failed
,
he
quitted
the
reins
,
and
fastening
by
instinct
on
the
mane
,
was
in
this
condition
conveyed
into
the
midst
of
the
sportsmen
,
who
were
astonished
at
the
sight
of
such
an
apparition
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
their
surprize
to
be
wondered
at
,
if
we
reflect
on
the
figure
that
presented
itself
to
their
view
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
's
person
was
at
all
times
an
object
of
admiration
;
much
more
so
on
this
occasion
,
when
every
singularity
was
aggravated
by
the
circumstances
of
his
dress
and
disaster
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
put
on
in
honour
of
his
nuptials
his
best
coat
of
blue
broad
cloth
,
cut
by
a
taylor
of
Ramsgate
,
and
trimmed
with
five
dozen
of
brass
buttons
,
large
and
small
;
his
breeches
were
of
the
same
piece
,
fastened
at
the
knees
with
large
bunches
of
tape
<EOS>
;
his
waistcoat
was
of
red
pluth
lapelled
with
green
velvet
,
and
garnished
with
vellum
holes
;
his
boots
bore
an
intimate
resemblance
both
in
colour
and
shape
to
a
pair
of
leathern
buckets
;
his
shoulder
was
graced
with
a
broad
buff
belt
,
from
whence
depended
a
huge
hanger
with
a
hilt
like
that
of
a
backsword
;
and
on
each
side
of
his
pummel
appeared
a
rusty
pistol
rammed
in
a
case
covered
with
bear
-
skin
.
    
<EOS>
The
loss
of
his
tye
-
periwig
and
laced
hat
,
which
were
curiosities
of
the
kind
,
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
improvement
of
the
picture
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
by
exhibiting
his
bald
pate
,
and
the
natural
extension
of
his
lanthorn
jaws
,
added
to
the
peculiarity
and
extravagance
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
Such
a
spectacle
could
not
have
failed
of
diverting
the
whole
company
from
the
chace
,
had
his
horse
thought
proper
to
pursue
a
different
route
,
but
the
beast
was
too
keen
a
sporter
to
choose
any
other
way
than
that
which
the
stag
followed
;
and
therefore
,
without
stopping
to
gratify
the
curiosity
of
the
spectators
,
he
in
a
few
minutes
outstripped
every
hunter
in
the
field
;
and
there
being
a
deep
hollow
way
betwixt
him
and
the
hounds
,
rather
than
ride
round
about
the
length
of
a
furlong
to
a
path
that
crossed
the
lane
,
he
transported
himself
at
one
jump
,
to
the
unspeakable
astonishment
and
terror
of
a
waggoner
who
chanced
to
be
underneath
,
and
saw
this
phenomenon
fly
over
his
carriage
.
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
only
adventure
he
atchieved
.
<EOS>
The
stag
having
taken
a
deep
river
that
lay
in
his
way
,
every
man
directed
his
course
to
a
bridge
in
the
neighbourhood
;
but
our
bridegroom
's
courser
despising
all
such
conveniences
,
plunged
into
the
stream
without
hesitation
,
and
swam
in
a
twinkling
to
the
opposite
shore
.
<EOS>
This
sudden
immersion
into
an
element
of
which
Trunnion
was
properly
a
native
,
in
all
probability
helped
to
recruit
the
exhausted
spirits
of
his
rider
,
who
at
his
landing
on
the
other
side
gave
some
tokens
of
sensation
,
by
hollowing
aloud
for
assistance
,
which
he
could
not
possibly
receive
,
because
his
horse
still
maintained
the
advantage
he
had
gained
,
and
would
not
allow
himself
to
be
overtaken
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
after
a
long
chace
that
lasted
several
hours
,
and
extended
to
a
dozen
miles
at
least
,
he
was
the
first
in
at
the
death
of
the
deer
,
being
seconded
by
the
lieutenant
's
gelding
,
which
actuated
by
the
same
spirit
,
had
,
without
a
rider
,
followed
his
companion
's
example
.
    
<EOS>
Our
bridegroom
finding
himself
at
last
brought
up
,
or
in
other
words
,
at
the
end
of
his
career
,
took
the
opportunity
of
this
first
pause
,
to
desire
the
huntsmen
would
lend
him
a
hand
in
dismounting
;
and
was
by
their
condescension
safely
placed
on
the
grass
,
where
he
sat
staring
at
the
company
as
they
came
in
,
with
such
wildness
of
astonishment
in
his
looks
,
as
if
he
had
been
a
creature
of
another
species
,
dropt
among
them
from
the
clouds
.
    
<EOS>
Before
they
had
fleshed
the
hounds
,
however
,
he
recollected
himself
,
and
seeing
one
of
the
sportsmen
take
a
small
flask
out
of
his
pocket
and
apply
it
to
his
mouth
,
judged
the
cordial
to
be
no
other
than
neat
Coniac
,
which
it
really
was
;
and
expressing
a
desire
of
participation
,
was
immediately
accommodated
with
a
moderate
dose
,
which
perfectly
compleated
his
recovery
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
he
and
his
two
horses
had
engrossed
the
attention
of
the
whole
crowd
;
while
some
admired
the
elegant
proportion
and
uncommon
spirit
of
the
two
animals
,
the
rest
contemplated
the
surprising
appearance
of
their
master
,
whom
before
they
had
only
seen
en
passant
;
and
at
length
,
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
accosting
him
very
courteously
,
signified
his
wonder
at
seeing
him
in
such
an
equipage
,
and
asked
if
he
had
not
dropped
his
companion
by
the
way
.
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
ye
,
brother
,
(
replied
the
commodore
)
mayhap
<EOS>
you
think
me
an
odd
sort
of
a
fellow
,
seeing
me
in
this
trim
,
especially
as
I
have
lost
part
of
my
rigging
;
but
this
here
is
the
case
,
d'ye
see
:
    
I
weighed
anchor
from
my
own
house
this
morning
at
ten
AM
with
fair
weather
,
and
a
favourable
breeze
at
south
southeast
,
being
bound
to
the
next
church
,
on
the
voyage
of
matrimony
:
<EOS>
but
howsomever
,
we
had
not
run
down
a
quarter
of
a
league
,
when
the
wind
shifting
,
blowed
directly
in
our
teeth
;
so
that
we
were
forced
to
tack
all
the
way
,
d'ye
see
,
and
had
almost
beat
up
within
sight
of
port
,
when
these
sons
of
bitches
of
horses
,
which
I
had
bought
but
two
days
before
(
for
my
own
part
,
I
believe
they
are
devils
incarnate
)
<EOS>
luffed
round
in
a
trice
,
and
then
refusing
the
helm
,
drove
away
like
lightning
with
me
and
my
lieutenant
,
who
soon
came
to
anchor
in
an
exceeding
good
birth
.
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
part
,
I
have
been
carried
over
rocks
,
and
flats
,
and
quicksands
;
among
which
I
have
pitched
away
a
special
good
tye
-
periwig
,
and
an
iron
-
bound
hat
;
and
at
last
,
thank
God
!
<EOS>
am
got
into
smooth
water
and
safe
riding
:
<EOS>
but
if
ever
I
venture
my
carcase
upon
such
a
hare'um
scare'um
blood
of
a
bitch
again
,
my
name
is
not
Hawser
Trunnion
,
d####n
my
eyes
!
"
    
<EOS>
One
of
the
company
,
struck
with
this
name
,
which
he
had
often
heard
,
immediately
laid
hold
on
his
declaration
at
the
close
of
this
singular
account
;
and
observing
that
his
horses
were
very
vicious
,
asked
how
he
intended
to
return
?
"
<EOS>
As
for
that
matter
,
(
replied
Mr
Trunnion
)
<EOS>
I
am
resolved
to
hire
a
sledge
or
waggon
,
or
such
a
thing
as
a
jack
-
ass
;
for
I
'll
be
d####n'd
if
ever
I
cross
the
back
of
a
horse
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
these
creatures
?
<EOS>
(
said
the
other
,
pointing
to
the
hunters
)
<EOS>
they
seem
to
have
some
mettle
;
but
then
they
are
meer
colts
,
and
will
take
the
devil
and
all
of
breaking
.
<EOS>
Methinks
this
hither
one
is
shoulder
-
slipped
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Damn
them
,
(
cried
the
commodore
)
<EOS>
I
wish
both
their
necks
were
broke
,
thof
<EOS>
the
two
cost
me
forty
good
yellow
-
boys
.
"
<EOS>
"
Forty
guineas
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
stranger
,
who
was
a
squire
and
a
jocky
,
as
well
as
owner
of
the
pack
)
Lord
!
<EOS>
Lord
!
<EOS>
how
a
man
may
be
imposed
upon
!
<EOS>
Why
,
these
cattle
are
clumsy
enough
to
go
to
plow
:
mind
what
a
flat
counter
;
do
but
observe
how
sharp
this
here
one
is
in
the
withers
;
then
he
's
fired
in
the
further
fetlock
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
connoisseur
in
horse
-
flesh
,
having
discovered
in
them
all
the
defects
which
can
possibly
be
found
in
that
species
of
animals
,
offered
to
give
him
ten
guineas
for
the
two
,
saying
,
he
would
convert
them
into
beasts
of
burthen
.
<EOS>
The
owner
,
who
(
after
what
had
happened
)
was
very
well
disposed
to
listen
to
any
thing
that
was
said
to
their
prejudice
,
implicitly
believed
the
truth
of
the
stranger
's
asseverations
,
discharged
a
furious
volley
of
oaths
against
the
rascal
who
had
taken
him
in
,
and
forthwith
struck
a
bargain
with
the
squire
,
who
paid
him
instantly
for
his
purchase
;
in
consequence
of
which
he
won
the
plate
at
the
next
Canterbury
races
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
transacted
to
the
mutual
satisfaction
of
both
parties
,
as
well
as
to
the
general
entertainment
of
the
company
,
who
laughed
in
their
sleeves
at
the
dexterity
of
their
friend
,
Trunnion
was
set
upon
the
squire
's
own
horse
,
and
led
by
his
servant
in
the
midst
of
this
cavalcade
,
which
proceeded
to
a
neighbouring
village
,
where
they
had
bespoke
dinner
,
and
where
our
bridegroom
found
means
to
provide
himself
with
another
hat
and
wig
.
    
<EOS>
With
regard
to
his
marriage
,
he
bore
his
disappointment
with
the
temper
of
a
philosopher
;
and
the
exercise
he
had
undergone
having
quickened
his
appetite
,
sat
down
at
table
in
the
midst
of
his
new
acquaintance
,
making
a
very
hearty
meal
,
and
moistening
every
morsel
with
a
draught
of
the
ale
,
which
he
found
very
much
to
his
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
IX
<EOS>
He
is
found
by
the
lieutenant
;
reconducted
to
his
own
house
;
married
to
Mrs
Grizzle
,
who
meets
with
a
small
misfortune
in
the
night
,
and
asserts
her
prerogative
next
morning
;
in
consequence
of
which
her
husband
's
eye
is
endangered
.
   
<EOS>
Mean
while
lieutenant
Hatchway
made
shift
to
hobble
to
the
church
,
where
he
informed
the
company
of
what
had
happened
to
the
commodore
;
and
the
bride
behaved
with
great
decency
on
the
occasion
;
for
,
as
soon
as
she
understood
the
danger
to
which
her
future
husband
was
exposed
,
she
fainted
in
the
arms
of
her
sister
-
in
-
law
,
to
the
surprize
of
all
the
spectators
,
who
could
not
comprehend
the
cause
of
her
disorder
;
and
when
she
was
recovered
by
the
application
of
smelling
-
bottles
,
earnestly
begged
that
Mr
Hatchway
and
Tom
Pipes
would
take
her
brother
's
coach
,
and
go
in
quest
of
their
commander
.
    
<EOS>
This
task
they
readily
undertook
,
being
escorted
by
all
the
rest
of
his
adherents
on
horseback
;
while
the
bride
and
her
friends
were
invited
to
the
parson
's
house
,
and
the
ceremony
deferred
till
another
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
steering
his
course
as
near
the
line
of
direction
in
which
Trunnion
went
off
as
the
coach
-
road
would
permit
,
got
intelligence
of
his
track
from
one
farm
-
house
to
another
;
for
such
an
apparition
could
not
fail
of
attracting
particular
notice
;
and
one
of
the
horsemen
having
picked
up
his
hat
and
wig
in
a
bye
-
path
,
the
whole
troop
entered
the
village
where
he
was
lodged
,
about
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
When
they
understood
he
was
safely
housed
at
the
George
,
they
rode
up
to
the
door
in
a
body
,
and
expressed
their
satisfaction
in
three
chears
;
which
were
returned
by
the
company
within
,
as
soon
as
they
were
instructed
in
the
nature
of
the
salute
by
Trunnion
,
who
by
this
time
had
entered
into
all
the
jollity
of
his
new
friends
,
and
was
indeed
more
than
half
-
seas
over
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
was
introduced
to
all
present
as
his
sworn
brother
,
and
had
something
tossed
up
for
his
dinner
.
<EOS>
Tom
Pipes
and
the
crew
were
regaled
in
another
room
;
and
a
fresh
pair
of
horses
being
put
to
the
coach
,
about
six
in
the
evening
the
commodore
,
with
all
his
attendants
,
departed
for
the
garrison
,
after
having
shook
hands
with
every
individual
in
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
Without
any
farther
accident
he
was
conveyed
in
safety
to
his
own
gate
before
nine
,
and
committed
to
the
care
of
Pipes
,
who
carried
him
instantly
to
his
hammock
,
while
the
lieutenant
was
driven
away
to
the
place
where
the
bride
and
her
friends
remained
in
great
anxiety
,
which
vanished
when
he
assured
them
that
his
commodore
was
safe
,
being
succeeded
by
abundance
of
mirth
and
pleasantry
at
the
account
he
gave
of
Trunnion
's
adventure
.
    
<EOS>
Another
day
was
fixed
for
the
nuptials
;
and
,
in
order
to
baulk
the
curiosity
of
idle
people
,
which
had
given
great
offence
,
the
parson
was
prevailed
upon
to
perform
the
ceremony
in
the
garrison
,
which
all
that
day
was
adorned
with
flags
and
pendants
displayed
,
and
at
night
illuminated
by
the
direction
of
Hatchway
,
who
also
ordered
the
patereroes
to
be
fired
as
soon
as
the
marriage
knot
was
tied
.
<EOS>
Neither
were
the
other
parts
of
the
entertainment
neglected
by
this
ingenious
contriver
,
who
produced
undeniable
proofs
of
his
elegance
and
art
in
the
wedding
-
supper
,
which
had
been
committed
to
his
management
and
direction
.
<EOS>
This
general
banquet
was
intirely
composed
of
sea
-
dishes
;
a
huge
pillaw
,
consisting
of
a
large
piece
of
beef
sliced
,
a
couple
of
fowls
,
and
half
a
peck
of
rice
,
smoaked
in
the
middle
of
the
board
:
a
dish
of
hard
fish
swimming
in
oil
appeared
at
each
end
,
the
sides
being
furnished
with
a
mess
of
that
savoury
composition
known
by
the
name
of
lob
's
course
,
and
a
plate
of
salmagundy
.
<EOS>
The
second
course
displayed
a
goose
of
a
monstrous
magnitude
,
flanked
with
two
Guinea
hens
,
a
pig
barbecu'd
,
an
hock
of
salt
pork
in
the
midst
of
a
pease
-
pudding
,
a
leg
of
mutton
roasted
,
with
potatoes
,
and
another
boiled
,
with
yams
.
<EOS>
The
third
service
was
made
up
of
a
loin
of
fresh
pork
with
apple
-
sauce
,
a
kid
smothered
with
onions
,
and
a
terrapin
baked
in
the
shell
:
and
last
of
all
,
a
prodigious
sea
-
pye
was
presented
,
with
an
infinite
volume
of
pancakes
and
fritters
.
<EOS>
That
every
thing
might
be
answerable
to
the
magnificence
of
this
delicate
feast
,
he
had
provided
vast
quantities
of
strong
beer
,
flip
,
rumbo
,
and
burnt
brandy
,
with
plenty
of
Barbadoes
water
for
the
ladies
;
and
hired
all
the
fiddles
within
six
miles
,
who
,
with
the
addition
of
a
drum
,
bag
-
pipe
,
and
Welch
-
harp
,
regaled
the
guests
with
a
most
melodious
concert
.
    
<EOS>
The
company
,
who
were
not
at
all
exceptious
,
seemed
extremely
well
pleased
with
every
particular
of
the
entertainment
;
and
the
evening
being
spent
in
the
most
social
manner
,
the
bride
was
by
her
sister
conducted
to
her
apartment
,
where
,
however
,
a
trifling
circumstance
had
like
to
have
destroyed
the
harmony
which
had
been
hitherto
maintained
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
already
observed
,
that
there
was
not
one
standing
bed
within
the
walls
;
therefore
the
reader
will
not
wonder
that
Mrs
Trunnion
was
out
of
humour
,
when
she
found
herself
under
the
necessity
of
being
confined
with
her
spouse
in
a
hammock
,
which
tho
'
enlarged
with
a
double
portion
of
canvas
,
and
dilated
with
a
yoke
for
the
occasion
,
was
at
best
but
a
disagreeable
,
not
to
say
dangerous
situation
.
<EOS>
She
accordingly
complained
with
some
warmth
of
this
inconvenience
,
which
she
imputed
to
disrespect
,
and
at
first
absolutely
refused
to
put
up
with
the
expedient
:
but
Mrs
Pickle
soon
brought
her
to
reason
and
compliance
,
by
observing
that
one
night
would
soon
be
elapsed
,
and
next
day
she
might
regulate
her
own
oeconomy
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
persuaded
,
she
ventured
into
the
vehicle
,
and
was
visited
by
her
husband
in
less
than
an
hour
,
the
company
being
departed
to
their
own
homes
,
and
the
garrison
left
to
the
command
of
his
lieutenant
and
mate
.
<EOS>
But
it
seems
the
hooks
that
supported
this
swinging
couch
were
not
calculated
for
the
addition
of
weight
which
they
were
now
destined
to
bear
;
and
therefore
gave
way
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
to
the
no
small
terror
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
perceiving
herself
falling
,
screamed
aloud
,
and
by
that
exclamation
brought
Hatchway
with
a
light
into
the
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
she
had
received
no
injury
by
the
fall
she
was
extremely
discomposed
and
incensed
at
the
accident
,
which
she
even
openly
ascribed
to
the
obstinacy
and
whimsical
oddity
of
the
commodore
,
in
such
petulant
terms
as
evidently
declared
that
she
thought
her
great
aim
accomplished
,
and
her
authority
secured
against
all
the
shocks
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
Indeed
her
bedfellow
seemed
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
by
his
tacit
resignation
;
for
he
made
no
reply
to
her
insinuations
,
but
with
a
most
vinegar
aspect
crawled
out
of
his
nest
,
and
betook
himself
to
rest
in
another
apartment
,
while
his
irritated
spouse
dismissed
the
lieutenant
,
and
from
the
wreck
of
the
hammock
made
an
occasional
bed
for
herself
on
the
floor
,
fully
determined
to
provide
better
accommodation
for
next
night
's
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
Having
no
inclination
to
sleep
,
her
thoughts
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
night
were
engrossed
by
a
scheme
of
reformation
she
was
resolved
to
execute
in
the
family
;
and
no
sooner
did
the
first
lark
bid
salutation
to
the
morn
,
than
starting
from
her
humble
couch
,
and
huddling
on
her
cloaths
,
she
sallied
from
her
chamber
,
explored
her
way
thro
'
paths
before
unknown
,
and
in
the
course
of
her
researches
perceived
a
large
bell
,
to
which
she
made
such
effectual
application
as
alarmed
every
soul
in
the
family
.
<EOS>
In
a
moment
she
was
surrounded
by
Hatchway
,
Pipes
,
and
all
the
rest
of
the
servants
half
dressed
;
but
seeing
none
of
the
feminine
gender
appear
,
she
began
to
storm
at
the
sloth
and
laziness
of
the
maids
,
who
,
she
observed
,
ought
to
have
been
at
work
an
hour
at
least
before
she
called
;
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
understood
that
no
woman
was
permitted
to
sleep
within
the
walls
.
    
<EOS>
She
did
not
fail
to
exclaim
against
this
regulation
;
and
being
informed
that
the
cook
and
chambermaid
lodged
in
a
small
office
-
house
that
stood
without
the
gate
,
ordered
the
draw
-
bridge
to
be
let
down
,
and
in
person
beat
up
their
quarters
,
commanding
them
forthwith
to
set
about
scouring
the
rooms
,
which
had
not
been
hitherto
kept
in
a
very
decent
condition
,
while
two
men
were
immediately
employed
to
transport
the
bed
on
which
she
used
to
lie
from
her
brother
's
house
to
her
new
habitation
;
so
that
,
in
less
than
two
hours
,
the
whole
oeconomy
of
the
garrison
was
turned
topsy
-
turvy
,
and
every
thing
involved
in
such
tumult
and
noise
,
that
Trunnion
being
disturbed
and
distracted
with
the
uproar
,
turned
out
in
his
shirt
like
a
frantic
maniac
,
and
arming
himself
with
a
cudgel
of
crab
-
tree
,
made
an
irruption
into
his
wife
's
apartment
,
where
perceiving
a
couple
of
carpenters
at
work
,
in
joining
a
bedstead
,
he
,
with
many
dreadful
oaths
and
opprobrious
invectives
,
ordered
them
to
desist
,
swearing
he
would
suffer
no
bulk
-
heads
nor
hurricane
-
houses
to
stand
where
he
was
master
:
but
finding
his
remonstrances
disregarded
by
these
mechanics
,
who
believed
him
to
be
some
madman
belonging
to
the
family
,
who
had
broke
from
his
confinement
,
he
assaulted
them
both
with
great
fury
and
indignation
,
and
was
handled
so
roughly
in
the
encounter
,
that
in
a
very
short
time
he
measured
his
length
on
the
floor
,
in
consequence
of
a
blow
that
he
received
from
a
hammer
,
by
which
the
sight
of
his
remaining
eye
was
grievously
endangered
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
reduced
him
to
a
state
of
subjection
,
they
resolved
to
secure
him
with
cords
,
and
were
actually
busy
in
adjusting
his
fetters
,
when
he
was
exempted
from
the
disgrace
by
the
accidental
entrance
of
his
spouse
,
who
rescued
him
from
the
hands
of
his
adversaries
,
and
,
in
the
midst
of
her
condolance
,
imputed
his
misfortune
to
the
inconsiderate
roughness
of
his
own
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
He
breathed
nothing
but
revenge
,
and
made
some
efforts
to
chastise
the
insolence
of
the
workmen
,
who
,
as
soon
as
they
understood
his
quality
,
asked
forgiveness
for
what
they
had
done
with
great
humility
,
protesting
that
they
did
not
know
he
was
master
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
But
,
far
from
being
satisfied
with
this
apology
,
he
groped
about
for
the
bell
,
(
the
inflammation
on
his
eye
having
utterly
deprived
him
of
sight
)
and
the
rope
being
,
by
the
precaution
of
the
delinquents
,
conveyed
out
of
his
reach
,
began
to
storm
with
incredible
vociferation
,
like
a
lion
roaring
in
the
toil
,
pouring
forth
innumerable
oaths
and
execrations
,
and
calling
by
name
Hatchway
and
Pipes
,
who
being
within
hearing
,
obeyed
the
extraordinary
summons
,
and
were
ordered
to
put
the
carpenters
in
irons
,
for
having
audaciously
assaulted
him
in
his
own
house
.
    
<EOS>
His
myrmidons
seeing
he
had
been
evil
-
intreated
,
were
exasperated
at
the
insult
he
had
suffered
,
which
they
considered
as
an
affront
upon
the
dignity
of
the
garrison
;
the
more
so
,
as
the
mutineers
seemed
to
put
themselves
in
a
posture
of
defence
,
and
set
their
authority
at
defiance
:
they
therefore
unsheathed
their
cutlasses
,
which
they
commonly
wore
as
badges
of
their
commission
;
and
a
desperate
engagement
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
ensued
,
had
not
the
lady
of
the
castle
interposed
,
and
prevented
the
effects
of
their
animosity
,
by
assuring
the
lieutenant
that
the
commodore
had
been
the
aggressor
;
and
that
the
workmen
,
finding
themselves
attacked
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
,
by
a
person
whom
they
did
not
know
,
were
obliged
to
act
in
their
own
defence
,
by
which
he
had
received
that
unlucky
contusion
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Hatchway
no
sooner
learnt
the
sentiments
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
than
sheathing
his
indignation
,
he
told
the
commodore
he
should
always
be
ready
to
execute
his
lawful
commands
;
but
that
he
could
not
in
conscience
be
concerned
in
oppressing
poor
people
who
had
been
guilty
of
no
offence
.
    
<EOS>
This
unexpected
declaration
,
together
with
the
behaviour
of
his
wife
,
who
in
his
hearing
desired
the
carpenters
to
resume
their
work
,
filled
the
breast
of
Trunnion
with
rage
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
He
pulled
off
his
woollen
night
-
cap
,
pummelled
his
bare
pate
,
beat
the
floor
alternately
with
his
feet
,
swore
his
people
had
betrayed
him
,
and
cursed
himself
to
the
lowest
pit
of
hell
,
for
having
admitted
such
a
cockatrice
into
his
family
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
exclamations
did
not
avail
;
they
were
among
the
last
essays
of
his
resistance
to
the
will
of
his
wife
,
whose
influence
among
his
adherents
had
already
swallowed
up
his
own
;
and
who
now
peremptorily
told
him
,
that
he
must
leave
the
management
of
every
thing
within
doors
to
her
,
who
understood
best
what
was
for
his
honour
and
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
She
then
ordered
a
poultice
to
be
prepared
for
his
eye
,
which
being
applied
,
he
was
committed
to
the
care
of
Pipes
,
by
whom
he
was
led
about
the
house
like
a
blind
bear
growling
for
prey
,
while
his
industrious
yoke
-
fellow
executed
every
circumstance
of
the
plan
she
had
projected
;
so
that
,
when
he
recovered
his
vision
,
he
was
an
utter
stranger
in
his
own
house
.

Chapter
X
<EOS>
The
commodore
being
in
some
cases
restif
,
his
lady
has
recourse
to
artifice
in
the
establishment
of
her
throne
;
she
exhibits
symptoms
of
pregnancy
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
Trunnion
,
who
nevertheless
is
baulked
in
his
expectation
.
   
<EOS>
These
innovations
were
not
effected
without
many
loud
objections
on
his
part
;
and
divers
curious
dialogues
passed
between
him
and
his
yoke
-
fellow
,
who
always
came
off
victorious
from
the
dispute
;
insomuch
that
his
countenance
gradually
fell
;
he
began
to
suppress
,
and
at
length
intirely
devoured
his
chagrin
;
the
terrors
of
superior
authority
were
plainly
perceivable
in
his
features
,
and
in
less
than
three
months
he
became
a
thorough
-
paced
husband
.
<EOS>
Not
that
his
obstinacy
was
extinguished
,
tho
'
overcome
;
in
some
things
he
was
as
inflexible
and
muleish
as
ever
,
but
then
he
durst
not
kick
so
openly
,
and
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
being
passive
in
his
resentments
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
,
for
example
,
proposed
that
a
coach
and
six
should
be
purchased
,
as
she
could
not
ride
on
horseback
,
and
the
chaise
was
a
scandalous
carriage
for
a
person
of
her
condition
;
the
commodore
,
conscious
of
his
own
inferior
capacity
in
point
of
reasoning
,
did
not
think
proper
to
dispute
the
proposal
,
but
lent
a
deaf
ear
to
her
repeated
remonstrances
,
tho
'
they
were
inforced
with
every
argument
which
she
thought
could
sooth
,
terrify
,
shame
or
decoy
him
into
compliance
:
in
vain
did
she
urge
the
excess
of
affection
she
had
for
him
,
as
meriting
some
return
of
tenderness
and
condescension
;
he
was
even
proof
against
certain
menacing
hints
she
gave
,
touching
the
resentment
of
a
slighted
woman
;
and
he
stood
out
against
all
the
considerations
of
dignity
or
disgrace
,
like
a
bulwark
of
brass
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
he
moved
to
any
indecent
or
unkind
expressions
of
contradiction
,
even
when
she
upbraided
him
with
his
sordid
disposition
,
and
put
him
in
mind
of
the
fortune
and
honour
he
had
acquired
by
his
marriage
,
but
seemed
to
retire
within
himself
,
like
a
tortoise
when
attacked
,
that
shrinks
within
its
shell
,
and
silently
endure
the
scourge
of
her
reproaches
,
without
seeming
sensible
of
the
smart
.
    
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
the
only
point
in
which
she
had
been
baffled
since
her
nuptials
;
and
as
she
could
by
no
means
digest
the
miscarriage
,
she
tortured
her
invention
for
some
new
plan
by
which
she
might
augment
her
influence
and
authority
:
what
her
genius
refused
was
supplied
by
accident
;
for
she
had
not
lived
four
months
in
the
garrison
when
she
was
seized
with
frequent
qualms
and
reachings
,
her
breasts
began
to
harden
,
and
her
stomach
to
be
remarkably
prominent
:
in
a
word
,
she
congratulated
herself
on
the
symptoms
of
her
own
fertility
,
and
the
commodore
was
transported
with
joy
,
at
the
prospect
of
an
heir
of
his
own
begetting
.
    
<EOS>
She
knew
this
was
the
proper
season
for
vindicating
her
own
sovereignty
,
and
accordingly
employed
the
means
which
nature
had
put
in
her
power
.
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
rare
piece
of
furniture
and
apparel
for
which
she
did
not
long
;
and
one
day
as
she
went
to
church
,
seeing
lady
Stately
's
equipage
arrive
,
she
suddenly
fainted
away
.
    
<EOS>
Her
husband
,
whose
vanity
had
never
been
so
perfectly
gratified
as
with
this
promised
harvest
of
his
own
sowing
,
took
the
alarm
immediately
,
and
in
order
to
prevent
relapses
of
that
kind
,
which
might
be
attended
with
fatal
consequences
to
his
hope
,
gave
her
leave
to
bespeak
a
coach
,
horses
and
liveries
to
her
own
liking
.
<EOS>
Thus
authorized
,
she
in
a
very
little
time
exhibited
such
a
specimen
of
her
own
taste
and
magnificence
as
afforded
speculation
to
the
whole
county
,
and
made
Trunnion
's
heart
quake
within
him
,
because
he
foresaw
no
limits
to
her
extravagance
,
which
also
manifested
itself
in
the
most
expensive
preparations
for
her
lying
in
.
    
<EOS>
Her
pride
,
which
had
hitherto
regarded
the
representative
of
her
father
's
house
,
seemed
now
to
lose
all
that
hereditary
respect
,
and
prompt
her
to
outshine
and
undervalue
the
elder
branch
of
her
family
.
<EOS>
She
behaved
to
Mrs
Pickle
with
a
sort
of
civil
reserve
that
implied
a
conscious
superiority
,
and
an
emulation
in
point
of
grandeur
immediately
commenced
between
the
two
sisters
.
<EOS>
She
every
day
communicated
her
importance
to
the
whole
parish
,
under
pretence
of
taking
the
air
in
her
coach
,
and
endeavoured
to
extend
her
acquaintance
among
people
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
an
undertaking
attended
with
great
difficulty
,
for
all
persons
whatever
,
capable
of
maintaining
a
certain
appearance
,
will
always
find
admission
into
what
is
called
the
best
company
,
and
be
rated
in
point
of
character
according
to
their
own
valuation
,
without
subjecting
their
pretensions
to
the
smallest
doubt
or
examination
.
    
<EOS>
In
all
her
visits
and
parties
she
seized
every
opportunity
of
declaring
her
present
condition
,
observing
that
she
was
forbid
by
her
physicians
to
taste
such
a
pickle
,
and
that
such
a
dish
was
poison
to
a
woman
in
her
way
:
<EOS>
nay
,
where
she
was
on
a
footing
of
familiarity
,
she
affected
to
make
wry
faces
,
and
complained
that
the
young
rogue
began
to
be
very
unruly
,
writhing
herself
into
divers
contortions
,
as
if
she
had
been
grievously
incommoded
by
the
mettle
of
this
future
Trunnion
.
<EOS>
The
husband
himself
did
not
behave
with
all
the
moderation
that
might
have
been
expected
;
at
the
club
he
frequently
mention'd
<EOS>
this
circumstance
of
his
own
vigour
as
a
pretty
successful
feat
to
be
performed
by
an
old
fellow
of
fifty
-
five
,
and
confirmed
the
opinion
of
his
strength
by
redoubled
squeezes
of
the
landlord
's
hand
,
which
never
failed
of
extorting
a
satisfactory
certificate
of
his
might
.
<EOS>
When
his
companions
drank
to
the
Hans
en
kelderr
,
or
Jack
in
the
low
cellar
,
he
could
not
help
displaying
an
extraordinary
complacence
of
countenance
,
and
signified
his
intention
of
sending
the
young
dog
to
sea
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
able
to
carry
a
cartridge
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
him
an
officer
before
his
own
death
.
    
<EOS>
This
hope
helped
to
console
him
under
the
extraordinary
expence
to
which
he
was
exposed
by
the
profusion
of
his
wife
,
especially
when
he
considered
that
his
compliance
with
her
prodigality
would
be
limited
to
the
expiration
of
the
nine
months
,
of
which
the
best
part
was
by
this
time
elapsed
;
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
philosophical
resignation
,
her
fancy
sometimes
soared
to
such
a
ridiculous
and
intolerable
pitch
of
insolence
and
absurdity
,
that
his
temper
forsook
him
,
and
he
could
not
help
wishing
in
secret
,
that
her
pride
might
be
confounded
in
the
dissipation
of
her
most
flattering
hopes
,
even
tho
<EOS>
'
he
himself
should
be
a
principal
sufferer
by
the
disappointment
.
    
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
no
other
than
the
suggestions
of
temporary
disgusts
,
that
commonly
subsided
as
suddenly
as
they
arose
,
and
never
gave
the
least
disturbance
to
the
person
who
inspired
them
,
because
he
took
care
to
conceal
them
carefully
from
her
knowledge
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
she
happily
advanced
in
her
reckoning
,
with
the
promise
of
a
favourable
issue
;
the
term
of
her
computation
expired
,
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
she
was
visited
by
certain
warnings
that
seemed
to
bespeak
the
approach
of
the
critical
moment
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
got
up
with
great
alacrity
,
and
called
the
midwife
,
who
had
been
several
days
in
the
house
;
the
gossips
were
immediately
summoned
,
and
the
most
interesting
expectations
prevailed
;
but
the
symptoms
of
labour
gradually
vanished
,
and
,
as
the
matrons
sagely
observed
,
this
was
no
more
than
a
false
alarm
.
    
<EOS>
Two
nights
after
they
received
a
second
intimation
,
and
as
she
was
sensibly
diminished
in
the
waist
,
every
thing
was
supposed
to
be
in
a
fair
way
;
yet
this
visitation
was
not
more
conclusive
than
the
former
;
her
pains
wore
off
in
spite
of
all
her
endeavours
to
encourage
them
,
and
the
good
women
betook
themselves
to
their
respective
homes
,
in
expectation
of
finding
the
third
attack
decisive
,
alluding
to
the
well
-
known
maxim
,
that
number
three
is
always
fortunate
.
<EOS>
For
once
,
however
,
this
apothegm
failed
;
the
next
call
was
altogether
as
ineffectual
as
the
former
;
and
moreover
,
attended
with
a
phaenomenon
which
to
them
was
equally
strange
and
inexplicable
:
this
was
no
other
than
such
a
reduction
in
the
size
of
Mrs
Trunnion
as
might
have
been
expected
after
the
birth
of
a
full
-
grown
child
.
    
<EOS>
Startled
at
such
an
unaccountable
event
,
they
sat
in
close
divan
;
and
concluding
that
the
case
was
in
all
respects
unnatural
and
prodigious
,
desired
that
a
messenger
might
be
immediately
dispatched
for
some
male
practitioner
in
the
art
of
midwifery
.
    
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
without
guessing
the
cause
of
their
perplexity
,
ordered
Pipes
immediately
on
this
piece
of
duty
;
and
in
less
than
two
hours
they
were
assisted
by
the
advice
of
a
surgeon
of
the
neighbourhood
,
who
boldly
affirmed
that
the
patient
had
never
been
with
child
.
<EOS>
This
asseveration
was
like
a
clap
of
thunder
to
Mr
Trunnion
,
who
had
been
during
eight
whole
days
and
nights
in
continual
expectation
of
being
hailed
with
the
appellation
of
father
.
    
<EOS>
After
some
recollection
he
swore
the
surgeon
was
an
ignorant
fellow
,
and
that
he
would
not
take
his
word
for
what
he
advanced
,
being
comforted
and
confirmed
in
his
want
of
faith
by
the
insinuations
of
the
midwife
,
who
still
persisted
to
feed
Mrs
Trunnion
with
hopes
of
a
speedy
and
safe
delivery
;
observing
that
she
had
been
concerned
in
many
a
case
of
the
same
nature
,
where
a
fine
child
was
found
,
even
after
all
signs
of
the
mother
's
pregnancy
had
disappeared
.
<EOS>
Every
twig
of
hope
,
how
slender
soever
it
may
be
,
is
eagerly
caught
hold
on
by
people
who
find
themselves
in
danger
of
being
disappointed
.
<EOS>
To
every
question
proposed
by
her
to
the
lady
with
the
preamble
of
"
Han't
you
?
"
or
"
Do
n't
you
?
"
<EOS>
an
answer
was
made
in
the
affirmative
,
whether
agreeable
to
truth
or
not
,
because
the
respondent
could
not
find
in
her
heart
to
disown
any
symptom
that
might
favour
the
notion
she
had
so
long
indulged
.
    
<EOS>
This
experienced
proficient
in
the
obstetric
art
was
therefore
kept
in
close
attendance
for
the
space
of
three
weeks
,
during
which
the
patient
had
several
returns
of
what
she
pleased
herself
with
believing
to
be
labour
-
pains
,
till
at
length
she
and
her
husband
became
the
standing
joke
of
the
parish
;
and
this
infatuated
couple
could
scarce
be
prevailed
upon
to
part
with
their
hopes
,
even
when
she
appeared
as
lank
as
a
greyhound
,
and
they
were
furnished
with
other
unquestionable
proofs
of
their
having
been
deceived
.
<EOS>
But
they
could
not
for
ever
remain
under
the
influence
of
this
sweet
delusion
,
which
at
last
faded
away
,
and
was
succeeded
by
a
paroxism
of
shame
and
confusion
,
that
kept
the
husband
within
doors
for
the
space
of
a
whole
fortnight
,
and
confined
his
lady
to
her
bed
for
a
series
of
weeks
,
during
which
she
suffered
all
the
anguish
of
the
most
intense
mortification
;
yet
even
this
was
subdued
by
the
lenient
hand
of
time
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
respite
from
her
chagrin
was
employed
in
the
strict
discharge
of
what
are
called
the
duties
of
religion
,
which
she
performed
with
the
most
rancorous
severity
,
setting
on
foot
a
persecution
in
her
own
family
,
that
made
the
house
too
hot
for
all
the
menial
servants
,
even
ruffled
the
almost
invincible
indifference
of
Tom
Pipes
,
harrassed
the
commodore
himself
out
of
all
patience
,
and
spared
no
individual
but
lieutenant
Hatchway
,
whom
she
never
ventured
to
disoblige
.

Chapter
XI
Mrs
Trunnion
erects
a
tyranny
in
the
garrison
,
while
her
husband
conceives
an
affection
for
his
nephew
Perry
,
who
manifests
a
peculiarity
of
disposition
even
in
his
tender
years
.
   
<EOS>
Having
exercised
herself
three
months
in
such
pious
amusements
,
she
appeared
again
in
the
world
;
but
her
misfortune
had
made
such
an
impression
on
her
mind
,
that
she
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
child
,
and
trembled
whenever
the
conversation
happened
to
turn
upon
a
christening
.
<EOS>
Her
temper
,
which
was
naturally
none
of
the
sweetest
,
seemed
to
have
imbibed
a
double
proportion
of
souring
from
her
disappointment
;
of
consequence
her
company
was
not
much
coveted
,
and
she
found
very
few
people
disposed
to
treat
her
with
those
marks
of
consideration
which
she
looked
upon
as
her
due
.
<EOS>
This
neglect
detached
her
from
the
society
of
an
unmannerly
world
;
she
concentred
the
energy
of
all
her
talents
in
the
government
of
her
own
house
,
which
groaned
accordingly
under
her
arbitrary
sway
,
and
<EOS>
in
the
brandy
-
bottle
found
ample
consolation
for
all
the
affliction
she
had
undergone
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
commodore
,
he
in
a
little
time
weathered
his
disgrace
,
after
having
sustained
many
severe
jokes
from
the
lieutenant
;
and
now
his
chief
aim
being
to
be
absent
from
his
own
house
as
much
as
possible
,
he
frequented
the
publick
-
house
more
than
ever
,
more
assiduously
cultivated
the
friendship
of
his
brother
-
in
-
law
Mr
Pickle
,
and
in
the
course
of
their
intimacy
conceived
an
affection
for
his
nephew
Perry
,
which
did
not
end
but
with
his
life
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
must
be
owned
that
Trunnion
was
not
naturally
deficient
in
the
social
passions
of
the
soul
,
which
,
tho
'
they
were
strangely
warped
,
disguised
and
overborne
by
the
circumstances
of
his
boisterous
life
and
education
,
did
not
fail
to
manifest
themselves
occasionally
thro
'
the
whole
course
of
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
As
all
his
hopes
of
propagating
his
own
name
had
perished
,
and
his
relations
lay
under
the
interdiction
of
his
hate
,
it
is
no
wonder
that
thro
'
the
familiarity
and
friendly
intercourse
subsisting
between
him
and
Mr
Gamaliel
,
he
contracted
a
liking
for
the
boy
,
who
by
this
time
entered
the
third
year
of
his
age
,
and
was
indeed
a
very
handsome
,
healthy
and
promising
child
;
and
what
seemed
to
ingratiate
him
still
more
with
his
uncle
,
was
a
certain
oddity
of
disposition
for
which
he
had
been
remarkable
even
from
his
cradle
.
<EOS>
It
is
reported
of
him
,
that
before
the
first
year
of
his
infancy
was
elapsed
,
he
used
very
often
,
immediately
after
being
dressed
,
in
the
midst
of
the
caresses
which
were
bestowed
upon
him
by
his
mother
while
she
indulged
herself
in
the
contemplation
of
her
own
happiness
,
all
of
a
sudden
to
alarm
her
with
a
fit
of
shrieks
and
cries
,
which
continued
with
great
violence
till
he
was
stripped
to
the
skin
with
the
utmost
expedition
by
order
of
his
affrighted
parent
,
who
thought
his
tender
body
was
tortured
by
the
misapplication
of
some
unlucky
pin
;
and
when
he
had
given
them
all
this
disturbance
and
unnecessary
trouble
,
he
would
lie
sprawling
and
laughing
in
their
faces
,
as
if
he
ridiculed
the
impertinence
of
their
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
<EOS>
it
is
affirmed
,
that
one
day
,
when
an
old
woman
who
attended
in
the
nursery
had
by
stealth
conveyed
a
bottle
of
cordial
waters
to
her
mouth
,
he
pulled
his
nurse
by
the
sleeve
,
and
by
a
slight
glance
detecting
the
theft
,
tipt
her
the
wink
with
a
particular
slyness
of
countenance
,
as
if
he
had
said
with
a
sneer
,
"
<EOS>
Ay
,
ay
,
that
is
what
you
must
all
come
to
.
"
<EOS>
But
these
instances
of
reflection
in
a
babe
nine
months
old
are
so
incredible
,
that
I
look
upon
them
as
ex
post
facto
observations
,
founded
upon
imaginary
recollection
,
when
he
was
in
a
more
advanced
age
,
and
his
peculiarities
of
temper
became
much
more
remarkable
:
of
a
piece
with
the
ingenious
discoveries
of
those
sagacious
observers
,
who
can
discern
something
evidently
characteristic
in
the
features
of
any
noted
personage
whose
character
they
have
previously
heard
explained
;
yet
,
without
pretending
to
specify
at
what
period
of
his
childhood
this
singularity
first
appeared
,
<EOS>
I
can
with
great
truth
declare
,
that
when
he
first
attracted
the
notice
and
affection
of
his
uncle
,
it
was
plainly
perceivable
.
    
<EOS>
One
would
imagine
he
had
marked
out
the
commodore
as
a
proper
object
of
ridicule
,
for
almost
all
his
little
childish
satire
was
levelled
against
him
.
<EOS>
I
will
not
deny
that
he
might
have
been
influenced
in
this
particular
by
the
example
and
instruction
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
delighted
in
superintending
the
first
essays
of
his
genius
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
gout
had
taken
up
its
residence
in
Mr
Trunnion
's
great
toe
,
from
whence
it
never
removed
,
no
not
for
a
day
,
little
Perry
took
great
pleasure
in
treading
by
accident
on
this
infirm
member
;
and
when
his
uncle
,
incensed
by
the
pain
,
used
to
damn
him
for
a
hell
-
begotten
brat
,
he
would
appease
him
in
a
twinkling
by
returning
the
curse
with
equal
emphasis
,
and
asking
what
was
the
matter
with
old
Hannibal
Tough
?
<EOS>
an
appellation
by
which
the
lieutenant
had
taught
him
to
distinguish
this
grim
commander
.
    
<EOS>
Neither
was
this
the
only
experiment
he
tried
upon
the
patience
of
the
commodore
,
with
whose
nose
he
used
to
take
indecent
freedoms
even
while
he
was
fondled
on
his
knee
;
in
one
month
he
put
him
to
the
expence
of
two
guineas
in
seal
-
skin
,
by
picking
his
pocket
of
divers
tobacco
pouches
,
all
of
which
he
in
secret
committed
to
the
flames
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
caprice
of
his
disposition
abstain
from
the
favourite
beverage
of
Trunnion
,
who
more
than
once
swallowed
a
whole
draught
in
which
his
brother
's
snuff
-
box
had
been
emptied
,
before
he
perceived
the
disagreeable
infusion
:
and
one
day
,
<EOS>
when
the
commodore
had
chastised
him
by
a
gentle
tap
with
his
cane
,
he
fell
flat
on
the
floor
as
if
he
had
been
deprived
of
all
sense
and
motion
,
to
the
terror
and
amazement
of
the
striker
;
and
after
having
filled
the
whole
house
with
confusion
and
dismay
,
opened
his
eyes
and
laughed
heartily
at
the
success
of
his
own
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
endless
and
perhaps
no
very
agreeable
task
,
to
enumerate
all
the
unlucky
pranks
he
played
upon
his
uncle
and
others
,
before
he
attained
the
fourth
year
of
his
age
;
about
which
time
he
was
sent
,
with
an
attendant
,
to
a
day
-
school
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
(
to
use
his
good
mother
's
own
expression
)
<EOS>
he
might
be
out
of
harm
's
way
.
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
he
made
little
progress
,
except
in
mischief
,
which
he
practised
with
impunity
,
because
the
school
-
mistress
would
run
no
risk
of
disobliging
a
lady
of
fortune
,
by
exercising
unnecessary
severities
upon
her
only
child
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
Mrs
Pickle
was
not
so
blindly
partial
as
to
be
pleased
with
such
unseasonable
indulgence
.
<EOS>
Perry
was
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
this
courteous
teacher
,
and
committed
to
the
instruction
of
a
pedagogue
,
who
was
ordered
to
administer
such
correction
as
the
boy
should
in
his
opinion
deserve
.
<EOS>
This
authority
he
did
not
neglect
to
use
;
his
pupil
was
regularly
flogged
twice
a
day
,
and
after
having
been
subjected
to
this
course
of
discipline
for
the
space
of
eighteen
months
,
declared
the
most
obstinate
,
dull
and
untoward
genius
that
ever
had
fallen
under
his
cultivation
;
instead
of
being
reformed
,
he
seemed
rather
hardened
and
confirmed
in
his
vicious
inclinations
,
and
was
dead
to
all
sense
of
fear
as
well
as
shame
.
<EOS>
His
mother
was
extremely
mortified
at
these
symptoms
of
stupidity
,
which
she
considered
as
an
inheritance
derived
from
the
spirit
of
his
father
,
and
consequently
insurmountable
by
all
the
efforts
of
human
care
.
<EOS>
But
the
commodore
rejoiced
over
the
ruggedness
of
his
nature
,
and
was
particularly
pleased
when
upon
inquiry
he
found
that
Perry
had
beaten
all
the
boys
in
the
school
;
a
circumstance
from
which
he
prognosticated
every
thing
that
was
fair
and
fortunate
in
his
future
fate
;
observing
,
that
at
his
age
he
himself
was
just
such
another
.
<EOS>
The
boy
,
who
was
now
turned
of
six
,
having
profited
so
little
under
the
birch
of
his
unsparing
governor
,
Mrs
Pickle
was
counselled
to
send
him
to
a
boarding
-
school
not
far
from
London
,
which
was
kept
by
a
certain
person
very
eminent
for
his
successful
method
of
education
.
<EOS>
This
advice
she
the
more
readily
embraced
,
because
at
that
time
she
found
herself
pretty
far
gone
with
another
child
,
that
she
hoped
would
console
her
for
the
disappointment
she
had
met
with
in
the
unpromising
talents
of
Perry
,
or
at
any
rate
divide
her
concern
,
so
as
to
enable
her
to
endure
the
absence
of
either
.

Chapter
XII
Peregrine
is
sent
to
a
boarding
-
school
,
becomes
remarkable
for
his
genius
and
ambition
.
   
<EOS>
The
commodore
understanding
her
determination
,
to
which
her
husband
did
not
venture
to
make
the
least
objection
,
interested
himself
so
much
in
behalf
of
his
favourite
,
as
to
fit
him
out
at
his
own
charge
,
and
accompany
him
in
person
to
the
place
of
his
destination
;
where
he
defrayed
the
expence
of
his
entrance
,
and
left
him
to
the
particular
care
and
inspection
of
the
usher
,
who
having
been
recommended
to
him
as
a
person
of
parts
and
integrity
,
received
per
advance
a
handsome
consideration
for
the
task
he
undertook
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
better
judged
than
this
piece
of
liberality
;
the
assistant
was
actually
a
man
of
learning
,
probity
,
and
good
sense
;
and
though
obliged
by
the
scandalous
administration
of
fortune
to
act
in
the
character
of
an
inferior
teacher
,
had
by
his
sole
capacity
and
application
,
brought
the
school
to
that
degree
of
reputation
which
it
never
could
have
obtained
from
the
talents
of
his
superior
.
<EOS>
He
had
established
an
oeconomy
,
which
though
regular
,
was
not
at
all
severe
,
by
enacting
a
body
of
laws
suited
to
the
age
and
comprehension
of
every
individual
;
and
each
transgressor
was
fairly
tried
by
his
peers
,
and
punished
according
to
the
verdict
of
the
jury
.
    
<EOS>
No
boy
was
scourged
for
want
of
apprehension
,
but
a
spirit
of
emulation
was
raised
by
well
-
timed
praise
and
artful
comparison
,
and
maintained
by
a
distribution
of
small
prizes
,
which
were
adjudged
to
those
who
signalized
themselves
either
by
their
industry
,
sobriety
or
genius
.
<EOS>
This
tutor
,
whose
name
was
Jennings
,
began
with
Perry
,
according
to
his
constant
maxim
,
by
examining
the
soil
;
that
is
,
studying
his
temper
,
in
order
to
consult
the
biass
of
his
disposition
,
which
was
strangely
perverted
by
the
absurd
discipline
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
He
found
him
in
a
state
of
sullen
insensibility
,
which
the
child
had
gradually
contracted
in
a
long
course
of
stupifying
correction
;
and
at
first
he
was
not
in
the
least
actuated
by
that
commendation
which
animated
the
rest
of
his
school
-
fellows
;
nor
was
it
in
the
power
of
reproach
to
excite
his
ambition
,
which
had
been
buried
,
as
it
were
,
in
the
grave
of
disgrace
:
the
usher
therefore
had
recourse
to
contemptuous
neglect
,
with
which
he
affected
to
treat
this
stubborn
spirit
;
foreseeing
that
if
he
retained
any
seeds
of
sentiment
,
this
weather
would
infallibly
raise
them
into
vegetation
:
his
judgment
was
justified
by
the
event
;
the
boy
in
a
little
time
began
to
make
observations
;
he
perceived
the
marks
of
distinction
with
which
virtue
was
rewarded
,
grew
ashamed
of
the
despicable
figure
he
himself
made
amongst
his
companions
,
who
far
from
courting
,
rather
shunned
his
conversation
;
and
actually
pined
at
his
own
want
of
importance
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jennings
saw
and
rejoiced
at
his
mortification
,
which
he
suffered
to
proceed
as
far
as
possible
,
without
endangering
his
health
.
<EOS>
The
child
lost
all
relish
for
diversion
,
loathed
his
food
,
grew
pensive
,
solitary
,
and
was
frequently
found
weeping
by
himself
.
    
<EOS>
These
symptoms
plainly
evinced
the
recovery
of
his
feelings
,
to
which
his
governor
thought
it
now
high
time
to
make
application
;
and
therefore
by
little
and
little
altered
his
behaviour
from
the
indifference
he
had
put
on
,
to
the
appearance
of
more
regard
and
attention
.
<EOS>
This
produced
a
favourable
change
in
the
boy
,
whose
eyes
sparkled
with
satisfaction
one
day
,
when
his
master
expressed
himself
with
a
shew
of
surprize
in
these
words
,
"
So
,
Perry
!
<EOS>
I
find
you
do
n't
want
genius
,
when
you
think
proper
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Such
encomiums
kindled
the
spirit
of
emulation
in
his
little
breast
;
he
exerted
himself
with
surprising
alacrity
,
by
which
he
soon
acquitted
himself
of
the
imputation
of
dullness
,
and
obtained
sundry
honorary
silver
pennies
,
as
acknowledgements
of
his
application
:
his
schoolfellows
now
sollicited
his
friendship
as
eagerly
as
they
had
avoided
it
before
;
and
in
less
than
a
twelvemonth
after
his
arrival
,
this
supposed
dunce
was
remarkable
for
the
brightness
of
his
parts
;
having
in
that
short
period
learnt
to
read
English
perfectly
well
,
made
great
progress
in
writing
,
enabled
himself
to
speak
the
French
language
without
hesitation
,
and
acquired
some
knowledge
in
the
rudiments
of
the
Latin
tongue
.
<EOS>
The
usher
did
not
fail
to
transmit
an
account
of
his
proficiency
to
the
commodore
,
who
received
it
with
transport
,
and
forthwith
communicated
the
happy
tidings
to
the
parents
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Gamaliel
Pickle
,
who
was
never
subject
to
violent
emotions
,
heard
them
with
a
sort
of
phlegmatic
satisfaction
that
scarce
manifested
itself
either
in
his
countenance
or
expressions
;
nor
did
the
child
's
mother
break
forth
into
that
rapture
and
admiration
which
might
have
been
expected
,
when
she
understood
how
much
the
talents
of
her
first
-
born
had
exceeded
the
hope
of
her
warmest
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
Not
but
that
she
professed
herself
well
pleased
with
Perry
's
reputation
;
though
she
observed
that
in
these
commendations
the
truth
was
always
exaggerated
by
school
-
masters
,
for
their
own
interest
;
and
pretended
to
wonder
that
the
usher
had
not
mingled
more
probability
with
his
praise
.
<EOS>
Trunnion
was
offended
at
her
indifference
and
want
of
faith
,
and
believing
that
she
refined
too
much
in
her
discernment
,
swore
that
Jennings
had
declared
the
truth
,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
;
for
he
himself
had
prophecied
from
the
beginning
,
that
the
boy
would
turn
out
a
credit
to
his
family
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
Mrs
Pickle
was
blessed
with
a
daughter
,
whom
she
had
brought
into
the
world
about
six
months
before
the
intelligence
arrived
;
so
that
her
care
and
affection
being
otherwise
engrossed
,
<EOS>
the
praise
of
Perry
was
the
less
greedily
devoured
.
<EOS>
The
abatement
of
her
fondness
was
an
advantage
to
his
education
,
which
would
have
been
retarded
,
and
perhaps
ruined
by
pernicious
indulgence
and
preposterous
interposition
,
had
her
love
considered
him
as
an
only
child
;
whereas
her
concern
being
now
diverted
to
another
object
that
shared
,
at
least
,
one
half
of
her
affection
,
he
was
left
to
the
management
of
his
preceptor
,
who
tutored
him
according
to
his
own
plan
,
without
any
lett
or
interruption
.
<EOS>
Indeed
all
his
sagacity
and
circumspection
were
but
barely
sufficient
to
keep
the
young
gentleman
in
order
;
for
now
that
he
had
won
the
palm
of
victory
from
his
rivals
in
point
of
scholarship
,
his
ambition
dilated
,
and
he
was
seized
with
the
desire
of
subjecting
the
whole
school
by
the
valour
of
his
arm
.
<EOS>
Before
he
could
bring
this
project
to
bear
,
innumerable
battles
were
fought
with
various
success
;
every
day
a
bloody
nose
and
complaint
were
presented
against
him
,
and
his
own
visage
commonly
bore
some
livid
marks
of
obstinate
contention
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
accomplished
his
aim
;
his
adversaries
were
subdued
,
his
prowess
acknowledged
,
and
he
obtained
the
laurel
in
war
as
well
as
wit
.
<EOS>
Thus
triumphant
,
he
was
intoxicated
with
success
.
<EOS>
His
pride
rose
in
proportion
to
his
power
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
endeavours
of
Jennings
,
who
practised
every
method
he
could
invent
for
curbing
his
licentious
conduct
,
without
depressing
his
spirit
,
he
contracted
a
large
proportion
of
insolence
,
which
a
series
of
misfortunes
that
happened
to
him
in
the
sequel
could
scarce
effectually
tame
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
there
was
a
fund
of
good
nature
and
generosity
in
his
composition
;
and
though
he
established
a
tyranny
among
his
comrades
,
the
tranquillity
of
his
reign
was
maintained
by
the
love
rather
than
by
the
fear
of
his
subjects
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
enjoyment
of
empire
,
he
never
once
violated
that
respectful
awe
with
which
the
usher
had
found
means
to
inspire
him
;
but
he
by
no
means
preserved
the
same
regard
for
the
principal
master
,
an
old
illiterate
German
quack
,
who
had
formerly
practised
corn
-
cutting
among
the
quality
,
and
sold
cosmetic
washes
to
the
ladies
,
together
with
teeth
-
powders
,
hair
-
dying
liquors
,
prolifick
elixirs
,
and
tinctures
to
sweeten
the
breath
.
<EOS>
These
nostrums
,
recommended
by
the
art
of
cringing
,
in
which
he
was
consummate
,
ingratiated
him
so
much
with
people
of
fashion
,
that
he
was
enabled
to
set
up
-
school
with
five
and
twenty
boys
of
the
best
families
,
whom
he
boarded
on
his
own
terms
,
and
undertook
to
instruct
in
the
French
and
Latin
languages
,
so
as
to
qualify
them
for
the
colleges
of
Westminster
or
Eaton
.
    
<EOS>
While
this
plan
was
in
its
infancy
,
he
was
so
fortunate
as
to
meet
with
Jennings
,
who
for
the
paultry
consideration
of
thirty
pounds
a
year
,
which
his
necessities
compelled
him
to
accept
,
took
the
whole
trouble
of
educating
the
children
upon
himself
,
contrived
an
excellent
system
for
that
purpose
,
and
by
his
assiduity
and
knowledge
executed
all
the
particulars
to
the
entire
satisfaction
of
those
concerned
,
who
by
the
bye
,
never
inquired
into
his
qualifications
,
but
suffered
the
other
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
labour
and
ingenuity
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
a
large
stock
of
avarice
,
ignorance
and
vanity
,
this
superior
had
certain
ridiculous
peculiarities
in
his
person
,
such
as
a
hunch
upon
his
back
,
and
distorted
limbs
,
that
seemed
to
attract
the
satirical
notice
of
Peregrine
,
who
,
young
as
he
was
,
took
offence
at
his
want
of
reverence
for
his
usher
,
over
whom
he
sometimes
chose
opportunities
of
displaying
his
authority
,
that
the
boys
might
not
misplace
their
veneration
.
<EOS>
Mr
Keypstick
,
therefore
,
such
as
I
have
described
him
,
incurred
the
contempt
and
displeasure
of
this
enterprising
pupil
,
who
now
being
in
the
tenth
year
of
his
age
,
had
capacity
enough
to
give
him
abundance
of
vexation
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XIII
<EOS>
He
exercises
his
talents
at
the
expence
of
the
school
-
master
,
whose
character
and
business
declining
,
he
desires
to
be
recalled
.
   
<EOS>
As
the
German
professed
himself
a
man
of
learning
,
and
sometimes
affected
to
make
a
parade
of
it
,
by
examining
the
younger
boys
on
the
rudiments
or
grammar
,
which
he
made
shift
to
comprehend
;
Peregrine
,
who
was
advanced
as
far
as
Cornelius
Nepos
,
used
to
teize
and
perplex
him
,
by
frequently
begging
his
explanation
of
certain
sentences
in
that
author
,
while
the
usher
was
engaged
in
some
other
employment
.
    
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
he
practised
a
thousand
pitiful
shifts
to
conceal
his
own
nakedness
;
sometimes
reprehending
the
boy
for
disturbing
him
in
his
meditations
,
sometimes
pleading
the
weakness
of
his
eyes
,
that
hindered
him
from
considering
the
passage
;
and
sometimes
remitting
him
to
the
dictionary
,
as
a
punishment
for
his
inattention
when
it
was
construed
by
Mr
Jennings
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
evasions
,
he
was
persecuted
by
his
tormentor
with
such
perseverance
,
that
he
could
find
no
other
resource
than
that
of
pretending
to
be
in
a
violent
hurry
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
always
quitted
the
place
;
so
that
whenever
Perry
and
his
companions
were
incommoded
by
his
presence
,
they
had
recourse
to
this
expedient
,
which
never
failed
to
expel
him
in
a
trice
.
    
<EOS>
Not
contented
with
having
thus
rendered
him
contemptible
in
the
eyes
of
his
disciples
,
this
indefatigable
wag
exercised
his
invention
in
various
contrivances
,
to
plague
,
disturb
and
expose
him
.
    
<EOS>
Conscious
of
his
own
defect
in
point
of
stature
and
proportion
,
the
little
pedant
used
all
the
additions
of
art
and
address
to
improve
his
person
,
and
raise
himself
as
near
as
possible
to
the
standard
dimensions
of
nature
;
with
this
view
he
wore
shoes
with
heels
three
inches
high
,
strutted
like
a
peacock
in
walking
,
and
erected
his
head
with
such
muscular
exertion
,
as
rendered
it
impossible
for
him
to
extend
his
vision
downwards
blow
the
preternatural
prominence
of
his
breast
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
therefore
,
taking
advantage
of
this
foppery
,
used
to
strew
his
way
with
bean
-
shells
,
on
which
whenever
he
chanced
to
tread
,
his
heels
slipped
from
under
him
,
his
hunch
pitched
upon
the
ground
,
and
the
furniture
of
his
head
fell
off
in
the
shock
;
so
that
he
lay
in
a
very
ludicrous
attitude
for
the
entertainment
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
He
moreover
seized
opportunities
of
studding
his
breeches
with
large
pins
,
which
when
he
sat
down
with
a
sudden
jirk
,
penetrated
the
skin
of
his
posteriors
,
and
compelled
him
to
start
up
again
with
infinite
expedition
,
and
roar
hideously
with
the
pain
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
perceiving
that
he
was
extremely
penurious
in
his
house
-
keeping
,
he
spoilt
many
a
pot
of
excellent
soup
maigre
,
by
slily
conveying
into
it
handfuls
of
salt
or
soot
,
and
even
drove
needles
into
the
heads
of
sundry
fowls
,
that
from
the
suddenness
of
their
death
he
might
conclude
some
infection
was
communicated
to
his
poultry
,
and
dispose
of
them
accordingly
for
the
half
of
their
value
.
<EOS>
But
no
instance
of
young
Pickle
's
mischievous
talents
affected
him
with
such
immediate
perplexity
and
confusion
as
this
that
I
am
going
to
recount
.
    
<EOS>
Being
apprized
by
one
of
his
friends
that
a
lady
of
fashion
intended
to
visit
his
school
on
a
certain
day
,
without
giving
any
previous
notice
of
her
coming
,
that
she
might
be
an
eye
-
witness
of
the
accommodation
in
his
house
before
she
would
commit
her
son
to
his
care
,
he
ordered
his
boarders
and
apartments
to
be
dished
out
for
the
occasion
,
spared
no
pains
in
adorning
his
own
person
,
and
in
particular
employed
a
whole
hour
in
adjusting
a
voluminous
tye
,
in
which
he
proposed
to
make
his
appearance
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
prepared
,
he
waited
with
great
confidence
and
tranquillity
,
and
no
sooner
saw
the
coach
appear
at
a
distance
,
than
he
went
to
his
closet
in
order
to
put
on
the
periwig
,
which
he
had
deposited
in
a
box
,
that
no
accident
might
ruffle
or
discompose
it
before
it
was
presented
to
her
ladyship
;
but
neither
the
box
nor
its
contents
were
to
be
found
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
thought
it
might
be
misplaced
by
some
of
the
servants
,
to
whom
he
called
with
great
eagerness
and
vociferation
,
while
he
himself
ran
from
room
to
room
in
quest
of
what
he
wanted
:
the
domesticks
could
give
him
no
intelligence
of
his
tye
;
he
heard
the
gates
opened
to
admit
the
equipage
,
his
impatience
increased
,
he
swore
in
high
Dutch
,
the
noise
of
the
wheels
on
his
pavement
saluted
his
ears
,
his
vexation
redoubled
,
and
tossing
his
night
-
cap
on
the
floor
,
he
waddled
down
stairs
to
the
hall
for
his
ordinary
periwig
,
which
he
now
found
himself
compelled
to
wear
.
<EOS>
How
shall
I
describe
his
distraction
when
he
understood
that
too
was
missing
!
<EOS>
he
became
quite
delirious
,
foamed
at
the
mouth
,
danced
to
and
fro
in
the
passage
like
one
bereft
of
his
senses
,
blasphemed
alternately
in
English
and
French
,
and
must
have
been
found
by
the
lady
in
that
frantic
condition
,
had
not
his
servants
conveyed
him
to
his
own
chamber
by
force
.
    
<EOS>
The
noble
visitant
was
received
by
Jennings
,
who
told
her
that
Mr
Keypstick
was
confined
to
his
bed
,
and
explained
the
whole
oeconomy
of
the
school
so
much
to
her
satisfaction
,
that
she
resolved
to
honour
them
with
the
charge
of
her
own
offspring
.
<EOS>
Keypstick
fell
sick
in
good
earnest
,
and
his
intellects
seemed
to
have
received
a
rude
shock
from
the
violence
of
the
passion
into
which
he
had
been
precipitated
by
the
roguery
of
Peregrine
,
who
had
concealed
both
periwigs
in
the
cellar
,
and
now
having
enjoyed
his
trick
,
carried
them
back
unperceived
to
the
places
from
which
they
had
been
removed
.
    
<EOS>
A
whole
week
elapsed
before
the
master
recovered
so
much
temper
as
to
appear
decently
in
public
;
and
even
then
his
countenance
was
stormy
,
and
his
resentment
against
the
authors
of
his
disgrace
so
intense
,
that
he
promised
a
reward
of
five
guineas
to
any
boy
that
would
discover
the
principal
actor
,
or
any
of
the
accomplices
concerned
in
this
audacious
intrigue
;
declaring
that
no
consideration
should
screen
the
offenders
from
condign
punishment
,
could
they
once
be
convicted
of
the
trick
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
had
not
conducted
this
Jeu
d'esprit
without
participation
,
and
some
there
were
privy
to
the
affair
whose
fidelity
was
not
incorruptible
;
but
their
secrecy
was
secured
by
the
terror
of
Peregrine
,
whose
authority
and
influence
was
such
as
to
baffle
the
master
in
all
his
endeavours
to
unravel
the
conspiracy
.
    
<EOS>
This
extraordinary
reserve
,
and
the
recollection
of
several
other
mortifying
jokes
he
had
undergone
,
inspired
him
with
ungenerous
suspicions
of
Mr
Jennings
,
who
he
could
not
help
thinking
had
been
at
the
bottom
of
them
all
,
and
spirited
up
principles
of
rebellion
in
the
school
,
with
a
view
of
making
himself
independent
.
<EOS>
Possessed
with
this
chimera
,
which
was
void
of
all
foundation
,
the
German
descended
so
low
as
to
tamper
in
private
with
the
boys
,
from
whom
he
hoped
to
draw
some
very
important
discovery
;
but
he
was
disappointed
in
his
expectation
;
and
this
mean
practice
reaching
the
ears
of
his
usher
<EOS>
,
he
voluntarily
resigned
his
employment
,
and
finding
interest
to
obtain
holy
orders
in
a
little
time
after
,
left
the
kingdom
,
hoping
to
find
a
settlement
in
some
of
our
American
plantations
.
    
<EOS>
The
departure
of
Mr
Jennings
produced
a
great
revolution
in
the
affairs
of
Keypstick
,
which
declined
from
that
moment
,
because
he
had
neither
authority
to
enforce
obedience
,
nor
prudence
to
maintain
order
among
his
scholars
;
so
that
the
school
degenerated
into
anarchy
and
confusion
,
and
he
himself
dwindled
in
the
opinion
of
his
imployers
,
who
looked
upon
him
as
superannuated
,
and
withdrew
their
children
from
his
tuition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
seeing
this
dissolution
of
their
society
,
and
finding
himself
every
day
deprived
of
some
companion
,
began
to
repine
at
his
situation
,
and
resolved
,
if
possible
,
to
procure
his
release
from
the
jurisdiction
of
a
person
whom
he
both
detested
and
despised
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
went
to
work
,
and
composed
the
following
billet
,
addressed
to
the
commodore
,
which
was
the
first
specimen
of
his
composition
in
the
epistolary
way
.
    
<EOS>
Honoured
and
loving
uncle
,
<EOS>
Hoping
you
are
in
good
health
,
this
serves
to
inform
you
,
that
Mr
Jennings
is
gone
,
and
Mr
Keypstick
will
never
meet
with
his
fellow
.
<EOS>
The
school
is
already
almost
broke
up
,
and
the
rest
daily
going
away
;
and
I
beg
of
you
of
all
love
to
have
me
fetched
away
also
,
<EOS>
for
I
can
not
bear
to
be
any
longer
under
one
who
is
a
perfect
ignoramus
,
who
scarce
knows
the
declination
of
musa
,
and
is
more
fit
to
be
a
scare
-
crow
than
a
schoolmaster
;
hoping
you
will
send
for
me
soon
,
with
my
love
to
my
aunt
and
my
duty
to
my
honoured
parents
,
craving
their
blessing
and
yours
.
<EOS>
And
this
is
all
at
present
from
,
honoured
uncle
,
your
well
-
beloved
and

<EOS>
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
was
overjoyed
at
the
receit
of
this
letter
,
which
he
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
greatest
efforts
of
human
genius
,
and
as
such
communicated
the
contents
to
his
lady
,
whom
he
had
disturbed
for
the
purpose
in
the
middle
of
her
devotion
,
by
sending
a
message
to
her
closet
,
whither
<EOS>
it
was
her
custom
very
frequently
to
retire
.
<EOS>
She
was
out
of
humour
at
being
interrupted
,
and
therefore
did
not
peruse
this
specimen
of
her
nephew
's
understanding
with
all
the
relish
that
the
commodore
himself
had
enjoyed
;
on
the
contrary
,
after
sundry
paralytical
endeavours
to
speak
,
(
for
her
tongue
sometimes
refused
its
office
)
<EOS>
she
observed
that
the
boy
was
a
pert
jackanapes
,
and
deserved
to
be
severely
chastised
for
treating
his
betters
with
such
disrespect
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
undertook
his
godson
's
defence
,
representing
with
great
warmth
that
he
knew
Keypstick
to
be
a
good
for
nothing
pimping
old
rascal
,
and
that
Perry
shewed
a
great
deal
of
spirit
and
good
sense
in
desiring
to
be
taken
from
under
his
command
;
he
therefore
declared
that
the
boy
should
not
live
a
week
longer
with
such
a
shambling
son
of
a
bitch
,
and
sanctioned
his
declaration
with
abundance
of
oaths
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
composing
her
countenance
into
a
look
of
religious
demureness
,
rebuked
him
for
his
profane
way
of
talking
,
and
asked
in
a
magisterial
tone
if
he
intended
never
to
lay
aside
that
brutal
behaviour
?
<EOS>
Irritated
at
this
reproach
,
he
answered
in
terms
of
indignation
,
that
he
knew
how
to
behave
himself
as
well
as
e'er
<EOS>
a
woman
that
wore
a
head
,
had
her
mind
her
own
affairs
,
and
with
another
repetition
of
oaths
gave
her
to
understand
that
he
would
be
master
in
his
own
house
.
    
<EOS>
This
insinuation
operated
upon
her
spirits
like
friction
upon
a
glass
globe
,
her
face
gleamed
with
resentment
,
and
every
pore
seemed
to
emit
particles
of
flame
.
<EOS>
She
replied
with
incredible
fluency
of
the
bitterest
expressions
.
<EOS>
He
retorted
equal
rage
in
broken
hints
and
incoherent
imprecations
.
<EOS>
She
rejoined
with
redoubled
fury
,
and
in
conclusion
he
was
fain
to
betake
himself
to
flight
,
ejaculating
curses
against
her
;
and
muttering
something
concerning
the
brandy
-
bottle
,
which
,
however
,
he
took
care
should
never
reach
her
ears
.
    
<EOS>
From
his
own
house
he
went
directly
to
visit
Mrs
Pickle
,
to
whom
he
imparted
Peregrine
's
epistle
with
many
encomiums
upon
the
boy
's
promising
parts
;
and
finding
his
commendations
but
coldly
received
,
desired
she
would
permit
him
to
take
his
godson
under
his
own
care
.
    
<EOS>
This
lady
,
whose
family
was
now
increased
by
another
son
that
seemed
to
engross
her
care
for
the
present
,
had
not
seen
Perry
during
a
course
of
four
years
,
and
with
regard
to
him
,
was
perfectly
weaned
of
that
infirmity
known
by
the
name
of
maternal
fondness
;
she
therefore
consented
to
the
commodore
's
request
with
great
condescension
,
and
a
polite
compliment
to
him
on
the
concern
he
had
all
along
manifested
for
the
welfare
of
the
child
.

Chapter
XIV
<EOS>
The
commodore
takes
Peregrine
under
his
own
care
.
<EOS>
The
boy
arrives
at
the
garrison
;
 
is
strangely
received
by
his
own
mother
;
 
enters
into
a
confederacy
with
Hatchway
and
Pipes
,
and
executes
a
couple
of
waggish
enterprizes
upon
his
aunt
.
   
<EOS>
Trunnion
having
obtained
this
permission
that
very
afternoon
,
dispatched
the
lieutenant
in
a
post
chaise
to
Keypstick
's
house
,
from
whence
in
two
days
<EOS>
he
returned
with
our
young
hero
;
who
being
now
in
the
eleventh
year
of
his
age
,
had
outgrown
the
expectation
of
all
his
family
,
and
was
remarkable
for
the
beauty
and
elegance
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
His
godfather
was
transported
at
his
arrival
,
as
if
he
had
been
actually
the
issue
of
his
own
loins
.
<EOS>
He
shook
him
heartily
by
the
hand
,
turned
him
round
and
round
,
surveyed
him
from
top
to
bottom
,
bad
Hatchway
take
notice
how
handsomely
he
was
built
;
squeezed
his
hand
again
,
saying
,
"
Damn
ye
,
you
dog
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
you
do
n't
value
such
an
old
crazy
son
of
a
bitch
as
me
,
a
rope
's
end
.
<EOS>
You
have
forgot
how
I
wo
nt
to
dandle
you
on
my
knee
,
when
you
was
a
little
urchin
no
higher
than
the
David
,
and
played
a
thousand
tricks
upon
me
,
burning
my
bacco
-
pouches
and
poisoning
my
rumbo
:
O
!
<EOS>
damn
ye
,
you
can
grin
fast
enough
<EOS>
I
see
;
I
warrant
you
have
learnt
more
things
than
writing
and
the
Latin
lingo
.
<EOS>
"
Even
Tom
Pipes
expressed
uncommon
satisfaction
on
this
joyful
occasion
;
and
coming
up
to
Perry
,
thrust
forth
his
forepaw
,
and
accosted
him
with
the
salutation
of
"
What
chear
,
my
young
master
?
    
<EOS>
I
am
glad
<EOS>
see
thee
with
all
my
heart
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
These
compliments
being
passed
,
his
uncle
halted
to
the
door
of
his
wife
's
chamber
,
at
which
he
stood
hollowing
,
"
Here
's
your
kinsman
Perry
,
belike
<EOS>
you
wo
n't
come
and
bid
him
welcome
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
Mr
Trunnion
,
said
she
,
why
will
you
continually
harrass
me
in
this
manner
with
your
impertinent
intrusion
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
harrow
you
,
replied
the
commodore
,
'
sblood
!
<EOS>
I
believe
your
upper
works
are
damaged
.
<EOS>
I
only
came
to
inform
you
that
here
was
your
cousin
,
whom
you
have
not
seen
these
four
long
years
;
and
I
'll
be
damned
if
there
is
such
another
of
his
age
within
the
king
's
dominions
,
d'ye
see
,
either
for
make
or
mettle
;
he
's
a
credit
to
the
name
,
d'ye
see
,
but
damn
my
eyes
<EOS>
I
'll
say
no
more
of
the
matter
;
if
you
come
<EOS>
you
may
,
if
you
wo
n't
you
may
let
it
alone
.
"
<EOS>
"
Well
,
I
wo
n't
come
then
(
answered
his
yoke
-
fellow
)
for
I
am
at
present
more
agreeably
employed
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oho
!
<EOS>
you
are
?
<EOS>
I
believe
so
too
;
"
cried
the
commodore
,
making
wry
faces
and
mimicking
the
action
of
dram
-
drinking
.
<EOS>
Then
addressing
himself
to
Hatchway
,
"
Prithee
Jack
,
said
he
,
go
and
try
thy
skill
on
that
stubborn
hulk
;
if
any
body
can
bring
her
about
I
know
you
wool
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
accordingly
taking
his
station
at
the
door
,
conveyed
his
perswasion
in
these
words
,
"
What
wo
n't
you
turn
out
and
hail
little
Perry
?
<EOS>
It
will
do
your
heart
good
to
see
such
a
handsome
young
dog
;
I
'm
sure
he
is
the
very
moral
of
you
,
and
as
like
as
if
he
had
been
spit
out
of
your
own
mouth
,
as
the
saying
is
;
do
shew
a
little
respect
for
your
kinsman
,
ca
n't
you
.
"
    
<EOS>
To
this
remonstrance
she
replied
in
a
mild
tone
of
voice
,
"
Dear
Mr
Hatchway
,
you
are
always
teazing
one
in
such
a
manner
;
sure
I
am
,
no
body
can
tax
me
with
unkindness
,
or
want
of
natural
affection
;
"
so
saying
,
she
opened
the
door
,
and
advancing
to
the
hall
where
her
nephew
stood
,
received
him
very
graciously
,
and
observed
that
he
was
the
very
image
of
her
papa
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
he
was
conducted
by
the
commodore
to
the
house
of
his
parents
;
and
strange
to
tell
,
<EOS>
no
sooner
was
he
presented
to
his
mother
than
her
countenance
changed
,
she
eyed
him
with
tokens
of
affliction
and
surprize
,
and
bursting
into
tears
,
exclaimed
her
child
was
dead
,
and
this
was
no
other
than
an
impostor
whom
they
had
brought
to
defraud
her
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Trunnion
was
confounded
at
this
unaccountable
passion
,
which
had
no
other
foundation
than
caprice
and
whim
;
and
Gamaliel
himself
so
disconcerted
and
unsettled
in
his
own
belief
,
which
began
to
waver
,
that
he
knew
not
how
to
behave
towards
the
boy
,
whom
his
godfather
immediately
carried
back
to
the
garrison
,
swearing
all
the
way
that
Perry
should
never
cross
their
threshold
again
with
his
goodwill
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
much
was
he
incensed
at
this
unnatural
and
absurd
renunciation
,
that
he
refused
to
carry
on
any
further
correspondence
with
Pickle
,
until
he
was
appeased
by
his
sollicitations
and
submission
,
and
Peregrine
owned
as
his
son
and
heir
.
<EOS>
But
this
acknowledgment
was
made
without
the
privity
of
his
wife
,
whose
vicious
aversion
he
was
obliged
,
in
appearance
,
to
adopt
.
<EOS>
Thus
exiled
from
his
father
's
house
,
the
young
gentleman
was
left
entirely
to
the
disposal
of
the
commodore
,
whose
affection
for
him
daily
increased
,
insomuch
,
that
he
could
scarce
prevail
upon
himself
to
part
with
him
,
when
his
education
absolutely
required
that
he
should
be
otherwise
disposed
of
.
    
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
this
extraordinary
attachment
was
,
if
not
produced
,
at
least
rivetted
by
that
peculiar
turn
in
Peregrine
's
imagination
,
which
we
have
already
observed
;
and
which
,
during
his
residence
in
the
castle
,
appeared
in
sundry
stratagems
he
practised
upon
his
uncle
and
aunt
,
under
the
auspices
of
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
assisted
him
in
the
contrivance
and
execution
of
all
his
schemes
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Pipes
exempted
from
a
share
in
their
undertakings
;
for
,
being
a
trusty
fellow
,
not
without
dexterity
in
some
cases
,
and
altogether
resigned
to
their
will
,
they
found
him
a
serviceable
instrument
for
their
purpose
,
and
used
him
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
sample
of
their
art
was
exhibited
upon
Mrs
Trunnion
,
from
whose
chamber
Peregrine
having
secreted
a
certain
utensil
,
divers
holes
were
drilled
through
the
bottom
of
it
by
their
operator
;
and
then
it
was
replaced
in
a
curious
case
that
stood
by
the
bed
-
side
,
in
which
it
was
reserved
for
midnight
-
occasions
.
<EOS>
The
good
lady
had
that
evening
made
several
extraordinary
visits
to
her
closet
,
and
that
sort
of
exercise
never
failed
of
having
a
diuretic
effect
upon
her
constitution
;
so
that
she
and
her
husband
were
scarce
warm
in
bed
,
when
she
found
it
convenient
to
reach
out
her
hand
,
and
introduce
this
receptacle
under
the
cloaths
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Peregrine
's
roguery
took
effect
.
    
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
who
had
just
composed
himself
to
rest
,
was
instantly
alarmed
with
a
strange
sensation
in
his
right
shoulder
,
on
which
something
warm
seemed
to
descend
in
various
streams
:
he
no
sooner
comprehended
the
nature
of
this
shower
,
which
in
a
twinkling
bedewed
him
from
head
to
foot
,
than
he
exclaimed
,
"
Blood
and
oons
!
<EOS>
I
'm
afloat
?
"
and
starting
up
,
asked
with
great
bitterness
if
she
had
pissed
through
a
watering
can
.
<EOS>
Equally
surprized
and
offended
at
the
indecent
question
,
she
began
to
regale
him
with
a
lecture
on
the
subject
of
that
respect
in
which
she
thought
him
so
deficient
;
but
perceiving
the
source
of
his
displeasure
,
was
silenced
in
the
middle
of
the
first
sentence
;
and
after
a
short
pause
of
astonishment
,
screamed
with
vexation
.
    
<EOS>
As
there
was
a
necessity
for
shifting
the
bed
-
linnen
,
she
got
up
with
great
reluctance
,
rung
her
bell
,
and
when
her
maid
entered
,
presented
this
new
fashioned
cullender
,
and
threatened
with
many
choleric
expressions
to
split
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
on
her
skull
.
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
the
phaenomenon
<EOS>
,
it
was
some
time
before
the
attendant
could
open
her
lips
in
her
own
vindication
;
at
length
,
however
,
she
protested
she
was
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
,
and
that
the
pot
was
sound
and
intire
when
she
rinsed
it
in
the
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
Her
suspicion
was
of
consequence
transferred
upon
Perry
,
against
whom
she
uttered
many
menacing
invectives
;
though
she
was
afterwards
ashamed
of
disclosing
her
resentment
,
and
in
the
mean
time
was
fain
to
take
up
her
night
's
lodging
in
another
apartment
;
while
Trunnion
,
after
a
string
of
unmeaning
oaths
,
which
were
extorted
from
him
by
his
present
uncomfortable
situation
,
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
adventure
;
and
Peregrine
with
his
confederates
,
applauded
themselves
in
secret
for
having
reduced
them
to
such
ridiculous
distress
.
    
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
the
impunity
with
which
they
performed
this
feat
,
our
associates
atchieved
another
,
that
had
like
to
have
been
attended
with
very
serious
consequences
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
having
one
day
received
a
sudden
call
which
she
could
not
help
obeying
,
her
nephew
,
who
was
always
on
the
scout
,
took
that
opportunity
of
gliding
unseen
into
her
closet
,
and
finding
her
case
open
,
infused
into
one
of
the
bottles
a
good
quantity
of
powdered
jallap
,
which
had
been
purchased
by
the
lieutenant
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
He
had
desired
the
apothecary
from
whom
he
bought
it
,
to
give
him
as
much
as
would
impregnate
two
quarts
of
brandy
,
which
,
he
guessed
,
each
bottle
might
contain
;
and
never
dreamed
that
the
patient
,
though
left
to
her
own
discretion
,
was
in
any
danger
of
taking
an
over
-
dose
;
he
therefore
directed
Perry
to
convey
the
whole
proportion
into
one
of
the
full
bottles
that
stood
at
some
distance
from
that
which
he
would
perceive
was
in
present
use
,
that
the
spirits
might
have
time
to
extract
the
virtues
of
the
root
before
it
should
come
to
their
turn
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
was
done
according
to
his
prescription
,
and
a
very
small
hole
being
bored
in
the
wainscot
,
through
which
they
could
reconnoitre
her
from
another
room
;
they
observed
her
motions
by
turns
,
with
a
view
of
seeing
whether
or
not
she
would
be
alarmed
by
the
extraordinary
taste
of
the
tincture
they
had
made
.
    
<EOS>
When
they
had
watched
in
this
manner
for
three
or
four
days
,
Pipes
being
upon
duty
,
perceived
her
take
the
first
cup
of
the
composition
,
which
she
had
no
sooner
swallowed
,
than
she
began
to
shut
her
eyes
,
smack
her
lips
,
spit
and
express
all
the
marks
of
loathing
and
disgust
:
nevertheless
,
she
seemed
to
doubt
her
own
sense
,
rather
than
the
flavour
of
the
Coniac
,
the
neatness
of
which
she
had
already
experienced
,
and
therefore
repeated
the
cordial
,
as
if
in
defiance
to
her
own
distaste
;
taking
care
,
however
,
to
arm
her
palate
with
a
large
lump
of
sugar
,
through
which
it
was
strained
in
its
passage
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
was
startled
when
he
understood
she
had
taken
such
a
dangerous
draught
of
the
medicine
,
especially
as
she
had
immediately
after
stepped
into
the
coach
to
go
to
church
,
where
he
feared
she
might
catch
cold
,
or
be
otherwise
affected
,
to
the
jeopardy
of
her
person
and
the
prejudice
of
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
fear
altogether
disappointed
.
<EOS>
The
service
was
not
half
performed
,
when
Mrs
Trunnion
was
suddenly
taken
ill
;
her
face
underwent
violent
flushings
and
vicissitudes
of
complexion
;
a
cold
clammy
sweat
bedewed
her
forehead
,
and
her
bowels
were
afflicted
with
such
agonies
,
as
compelled
her
to
retire
in
the
face
of
the
congregation
.
    
<EOS>
She
was
brought
home
in
torture
,
which
was
a
little
assuaged
when
the
dose
began
to
operate
;
but
such
was
the
excess
of
evacuation
she
sustained
,
that
her
spirits
were
quite
exhausted
,
and
she
suffered
a
succession
of
fainting
fits
that
reduced
her
to
the
brink
of
the
grave
,
in
spite
of
all
the
remedies
that
were
administered
by
a
physician
who
was
called
in
the
beginning
of
her
disorder
,
and
who
,
after
having
examined
the
symptoms
,
declared
that
the
patient
had
been
poisoned
with
arsenic
,
and
prescribed
oily
draughts
and
lubricating
injections
to
defend
the
coats
of
the
stomach
and
intestines
from
the
vellicating
particles
of
that
pernicious
mineral
;
at
the
same
time
hinting
,
with
a
look
of
infinite
sagacity
,
that
it
was
not
difficult
to
divine
the
whole
mystery
;
and
affecting
to
deplore
the
poor
lady
,
as
if
she
was
exposed
to
more
attempts
of
the
same
nature
;
thereby
glancing
obliquely
at
the
innocent
commodore
,
whom
the
officious
son
of
Aesculapius
suspected
as
the
author
of
this
expedient
,
to
rid
his
hands
of
a
yoke
-
fellow
,
for
whom
he
was
well
known
to
have
no
great
devotion
.
<EOS>
This
impertinent
and
malicious
insinuation
made
some
impression
upon
the
by
-
standers
,
and
furnished
ample
field
for
slander
,
to
asperse
the
morals
of
Trunnion
,
who
was
represented
through
the
whole
district
as
a
monster
of
barbarity
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
sufferer
herself
,
though
she
behaved
with
great
decency
and
prudence
,
could
not
help
entertaining
some
small
diffidence
of
her
husband
:
not
that
she
imagined
he
had
any
design
upon
her
life
,
but
that
he
had
been
at
pains
to
adulterate
the
brandy
,
with
the
view
of
detaching
her
from
that
favourite
liquor
.
    
<EOS>
On
this
supposition
she
resolved
to
act
with
more
caution
for
the
future
,
without
setting
on
foot
any
inquiry
about
the
affair
;
while
the
commodore
imputing
her
indisposition
to
some
natural
cause
,
after
the
danger
was
past
,
never
bestowed
a
thought
upon
the
subject
;
so
that
the
perpetrators
were
quit
for
their
fear
,
which
,
however
,
had
punished
them
so
effectually
,
that
they
never
would
hazard
any
more
jokes
of
the
same
nature
.

Chapter
XV
<EOS>
The
triumvirate
turn
the
stream
of
their
wit
upon
the
commodore
,
who
by
their
means
is
embroiled
with
an
attorney
,
and
terrified
with
an
apparition
.
   
<EOS>
The
shafts
of
their
wit
were
now
directed
against
the
commander
himself
,
whom
they
teized
and
terrified
almost
out
of
his
senses
.
<EOS>
One
day
while
he
was
at
dinner
,
Pipes
came
and
told
him
that
there
was
a
person
below
that
wanted
to
speak
with
him
immediately
about
an
affair
of
the
greatest
importance
,
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
;
upon
which
he
ordered
the
stranger
to
be
told
that
he
was
engaged
,
and
that
he
must
send
up
his
name
and
business
.
<EOS>
To
this
demand
he
received
for
answer
a
message
,
importing
that
the
person
's
name
was
unknown
to
him
,
and
his
business
of
such
a
nature
,
that
it
could
not
be
disclosed
to
any
one
but
the
commodore
himself
,
whom
he
earnestly
desired
to
see
without
loss
of
time
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
,
surprised
at
this
importunity
,
got
up
with
great
reluctance
in
the
middle
of
his
meal
,
and
descending
to
a
parlour
where
the
stranger
was
,
asked
in
a
surly
tone
what
he
wanted
with
him
in
such
a
damned
hurry
,
that
he
could
not
wait
till
he
had
made
an
end
of
his
mess
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
not
at
all
disconcerted
at
this
rough
address
,
advanced
close
up
to
him
on
his
tiptoes
,
and
with
a
look
of
confidence
and
conceit
,
laying
his
mouth
to
one
side
of
the
commodore
's
head
,
whispered
softly
in
his
ear
,
"
Sir
,
I
am
the
attorney
whom
you
wanted
to
converse
with
in
private
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
The
attorney
!
"
<EOS>
cried
Trunnion
,
staring
and
half
choaked
with
choler
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
,
at
your
service
,
replied
this
retainer
to
the
law
,
and
if
you
please
,
the
sooner
we
dispatch
the
affair
the
better
;
for
'
tis
an
old
observation
,
that
delay
breeds
danger
.
"
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
brother
,
said
the
commodore
,
who
could
no
longer
contain
himself
,
I
do
confess
that
I
am
very
much
of
your
way
of
thinking
,
d'ye
see
;
and
therefore
you
shall
be
dispatched
in
a
trice
;
"
so
saying
,
he
lifted
up
his
walking
staff
,
which
was
something
between
a
crutch
and
a
cudgel
,
and
discharged
it
with
such
energy
on
the
seat
of
the
attorney
's
understanding
,
that
if
there
had
been
any
thing
but
solid
bone
,
the
contents
of
his
skull
must
have
been
evacuated
.
    
<EOS>
Fortified
as
he
was
by
nature
against
all
such
assaults
,
he
could
not
withstand
the
momentum
of
the
blow
,
which
in
an
instant
laid
him
flat
on
the
floor
,
deprived
of
all
sense
and
motion
;
and
Trunnion
hopped
up
stairs
to
dinner
,
applauding
himself
in
ejaculations
all
the
way
for
the
vengeance
he
had
taken
on
such
an
impudent
petti
-
fogging
miscreant
.
    
<EOS>
The
attorney
no
sooner
awaked
from
this
trance
,
into
which
he
had
been
so
unexpectedly
lulled
,
than
he
cast
his
eyes
around
in
quest
of
evidence
,
by
which
he
might
be
enabled
the
more
easily
to
prove
the
injury
he
had
sustained
;
but
not
a
soul
appearing
,
he
made
shift
to
get
upon
his
legs
again
,
and
with
the
blood
trickling
over
his
nose
,
followed
one
of
the
servants
into
the
dining
-
room
,
resolved
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
the
assailant
,
and
either
extort
money
from
him
by
way
of
satisfaction
,
or
provoke
him
to
a
second
application
before
witnesses
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
entered
the
room
in
a
peal
of
clamour
,
to
the
amazement
of
all
present
,
and
the
terror
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
shrieked
at
the
appearance
of
such
a
spectacle
;
and
addressing
himself
to
the
commodore
,
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
Sir
,
said
he
,
if
there
be
law
in
England
,
I
'll
make
you
smart
for
this
here
assault
;
you
think
you
have
screened
yourself
from
a
prosecution
,
by
sending
all
your
servants
out
of
the
way
,
but
that
circumstance
will
appear
upon
trial
to
be
a
plain
proof
of
the
malice
propense
with
which
the
fact
was
committed
;
especially
when
corroborated
by
the
evidence
of
this
here
letter
,
under
your
own
hand
,
whereby
I
am
desired
to
come
to
your
own
house
to
transact
an
affair
of
consequence
;
"
so
saying
,
he
produced
the
writing
,
and
read
the
contents
in
these
words
.
<EOS>
$
$
	
<EOS>
Mr
Roger
Ravine
.
      
<EOS>
Sir
,
Being
in
a
manner
prisoner
in
my
own
house
,
I
desire
you
will
give
me
a
call
precisely
at
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
insist
upon
seeing
myself
,
as
I
have
an
affair
of
great
consequence
,
in
which
your
particular
advice
is
wanted
by
your
humble
servant
 
Hawser
Trunnion
.
    
<EOS>
The
one
-
eyed
commander
who
had
been
satisfied
with
the
chastisement
he
had
already
bestowed
upon
the
plaintiff
,
hearing
him
read
this
audacious
piece
of
forgery
,
which
he
considered
as
the
effect
of
his
own
villany
,
started
up
from
table
,
and
seizing
a
huge
turkey
that
lay
in
a
dish
before
him
,
would
have
applied
it
sauce
and
all
by
way
of
poultice
to
his
wound
,
had
he
not
been
restrained
by
Hatchway
,
who
laid
fast
hold
on
both
his
arms
,
and
fixed
him
to
his
chair
again
,
advising
the
attorney
to
sheer
off
with
what
he
had
got
.
<EOS>
Far
from
following
this
salutary
counsel
,
he
redoubled
his
threats
,
and
set
Trunnion
at
defiance
,
telling
him
he
was
not
a
man
of
true
courage
,
although
he
had
commanded
a
ship
of
war
,
or
else
he
would
not
have
attacked
any
person
in
such
a
cowardly
and
clandestine
manner
.
<EOS>
This
provocation
would
have
answered
his
purpose
effectually
,
had
not
his
adversary
's
indignation
been
repressed
by
the
suggestions
of
the
lieutenant
who
desired
his
friend
in
a
whisper
to
be
easy
,
for
he
would
take
care
to
have
the
attorney
tossed
in
a
blanket
for
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
This
proposal
,
which
he
received
with
great
approbation
,
pacified
him
in
a
moment
;
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
,
and
his
features
relaxed
into
a
grim
smile
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
disappeared
,
and
Ravine
proceeded
with
great
fluency
of
abuse
,
until
he
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Pipes
,
who
,
without
any
expostulation
,
led
him
out
by
the
hand
,
and
conducted
him
to
the
yard
,
where
he
was
put
into
a
carpet
,
and
in
a
twinkling
sent
into
the
air
by
the
strength
and
dexterity
of
five
stout
operators
,
whom
the
lieutenant
had
selected
from
the
number
of
domesticks
for
that
singular
spell
of
duty
.
    
<EOS>
In
vain
did
the
astonished
vaulter
beg
for
the
love
of
God
and
passion
of
Christ
,
that
they
would
take
pity
upon
him
,
and
put
an
end
to
his
involuntary
gambols
;
they
were
deaf
to
his
prayers
and
protestations
,
even
when
he
swore
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
if
they
would
cease
tormenting
him
,
he
would
forget
and
forgive
what
was
passed
,
and
depart
in
peace
to
his
own
habitation
;
and
continued
the
game
till
they
were
fatigued
with
the
exercise
.
    
<EOS>
Ravine
being
dismissed
in
a
most
melancholy
plight
,
brought
an
action
of
assault
and
battery
against
the
commodore
,
and
<EOS>
subpoena'd
all
the
servants
as
evidences
in
the
cause
;
but
as
none
of
them
had
seen
what
happened
,
he
did
not
find
his
account
in
the
prosecution
,
though
he
himself
examined
all
the
witnesses
,
and
among
other
questions
,
asked
whether
they
had
not
seen
him
come
in
like
another
man
?
<EOS>
and
whether
they
had
ever
seen
any
other
man
in
such
a
condition
as
that
in
which
he
had
crawled
off
?
<EOS>
But
this
last
interrogation
they
were
not
obliged
to
answer
,
because
it
had
reference
to
the
second
discipline
he
had
undergone
,
in
which
they
,
and
they
only
were
concerned
;
and
no
person
is
bound
to
give
testimony
against
himself
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
attorney
was
nonsuited
,
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
who
knew
him
,
and
found
himself
under
the
necessity
of
proving
that
he
had
received
in
course
of
post
,
the
letter
which
was
declared
in
court
a
scandalous
forgery
,
in
order
to
prevent
an
indictment
with
which
he
was
threatened
by
the
commodore
,
who
little
dreamt
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
planned
and
executed
by
Peregrine
and
his
associates
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
enterprize
in
which
this
triumvirate
engaged
,
was
a
scheme
to
frighten
Trunnion
with
an
apparition
,
which
they
prepared
and
exhibited
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
To
the
hide
of
a
large
ox
Pipes
fitted
a
leathern
vizor
of
a
most
terrible
appearance
,
stretched
on
the
jaws
of
a
shark
which
he
had
brought
from
sea
,
and
accommodated
with
a
couple
of
broad
glasses
instead
of
eyes
.
<EOS>
On
the
inside
of
these
he
placed
two
rush
lights
,
and
with
a
composition
of
sulphur
and
salt
-
petre
,
made
a
pretty
large
fuse
,
which
he
fixed
between
two
rows
of
the
teeth
.
<EOS>
This
equipage
being
finished
,
he
,
one
dark
night
chosen
for
the
purpose
,
put
it
on
,
and
following
the
commodore
into
a
long
passage
in
which
he
was
preceded
by
Perry
with
a
light
in
his
hand
,
kindled
his
fire
-
work
with
a
match
,
and
began
to
bellow
like
a
bull
.
<EOS>
The
boy
,
as
it
was
concerted
,
looking
behind
him
,
screamed
aloud
,
and
dropped
the
light
,
which
was
extinguished
in
the
fall
:
when
Trunnion
alarmed
at
his
nephew
's
consternation
,
exclaimed
,
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
what
's
the
matter
?
"
<EOS>
And
turning
about
to
see
the
cause
of
his
dismay
,
beheld
a
hideous
phantom
vomiting
blue
flame
,
which
aggravated
the
horrors
of
its
aspect
.
<EOS>
He
was
instantly
seized
with
an
agony
of
fear
,
which
divested
him
of
his
reason
;
nevertheless
,
he
,
as
it
were
mechanically
,
raised
his
trusty
supporter
in
his
own
defence
,
and
the
apparition
advancing
towards
him
,
aimed
it
at
this
dreadful
annoyance
with
such
a
convulsive
exertion
of
strength
,
that
had
not
the
blow
chanced
to
light
upon
one
of
the
horns
,
Mr
Pipes
would
have
had
no
cause
to
value
himself
upon
his
invention
.
<EOS>
Misapplied
as
it
was
,
he
did
not
fail
to
stagger
at
the
shock
,
and
dreading
another
such
salutation
,
closed
with
the
commodore
,
and
having
tripped
up
his
heels
,
retreated
with
great
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
then
that
Peregrine
,
pretending
to
recollect
himself
a
little
,
ran
with
all
the
marks
of
disturbance
and
affright
,
and
called
up
the
servants
to
the
assistance
of
their
master
,
whom
they
found
in
a
cold
sweat
upon
the
floor
,
his
features
betokening
horror
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
Hatchway
raised
him
up
,
and
having
comforted
him
with
a
cup
of
Nantz
,
began
to
inquire
into
the
cause
of
his
disorder
:
but
he
could
not
extract
one
word
of
answer
from
his
friend
,
who
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
during
which
he
seemed
to
be
wrapped
up
in
profound
contemplation
,
pronounced
aloud
,
"
By

<EOS>
Jack
,
you
may
say
what
you
wool
;
but
I
'll
be
damned
if
it
was
not
Davy
Jones
himself
<EOS>
:
I
know
him
by
his
saucer
-
eyes
,
his
three
rows
of
teeth
,
his
horns
and
tail
,
and
the
blue
smoak
that
came
out
of
his
nostrils
.
<EOS>
What
does
the
black
-
guard
,
hell
's
baby
want
with
me
?
<EOS>
I
'm
sure
I
never
committed
murder
,
nor
wronged
any
man
whatsomever
,
since
I
first
went
to
sea
.
"
<EOS>
This
same
Davy
Jones
,
according
to
the
mythology
of
sailors
,
is
the
fiend
that
presides
over
all
the
evil
spirits
of
the
deep
,
and
is
often
seen
in
various
shapes
,
perching
among
the
rigging
on
the
eve
of
hurricanes
,
shipwrecks
,
and
other
disasters
,
to
which
a
sea
-
faring
life
is
exposed
;
warning
the
devoted
wretch
of
death
and
woe
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
that
Trunnion
was
disturbed
by
a
supposed
visit
of
this
daemon
,
which
,
in
his
opinion
,
foreboded
some
dreadful
calamity
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XVI
<EOS>
He
is
also
by
their
device
engaged
in
an
adventure
with
the
exciseman
,
who
does
not
find
his
account
in
his
own
drollery
.
   
<EOS>
Howsoever
preposterous
and
unaccountable
that
passion
may
be
,
which
prompts
persons
,
otherwise
generous
and
sympathising
,
to
afflict
and
perplex
their
fellow
-
creatures
,
<EOS>
certain
it
is
our
confederates
entertained
such
a
large
proportion
of
it
,
that
not
satisfied
with
the
pranks
they
had
already
played
,
they
still
persecuted
the
commodore
without
ceasing
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
his
own
history
,
the
particulars
of
which
he
delighted
to
recount
,
he
had
often
rehearsed
an
adventure
of
deer
-
stealing
,
in
which
(
during
the
unthinking
impetuosity
of
his
youth
)
he
had
been
unfortunately
concerned
.
<EOS>
Far
from
succeeding
in
that
atchievement
,
he
and
his
associates
had
(
it
seems
)
been
made
prisoners
,
after
an
obstinate
engagement
with
the
keepers
,
and
carried
before
a
neighbouring
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
used
Trunnion
with
great
indignity
,
and
with
his
companions
committed
him
to
jail
.
    
<EOS>
His
own
relations
,
and
in
particular
an
uncle
on
whom
he
chiefly
depended
,
treated
him
during
his
confinement
with
great
rigour
and
inhumanity
,
and
absolutely
refused
to
interpose
his
influence
in
his
behalf
,
unless
he
would
sign
a
writing
,
obliging
himself
to
go
to
sea
within
thirty
days
after
his
release
,
under
the
penalty
of
being
proceeded
against
as
a
felon
.
<EOS>
The
alternative
was
either
to
undergo
this
voluntary
exile
,
or
remain
in
prison
disowned
and
deserted
by
every
body
,
and
after
all
suffer
an
ignominious
trial
,
that
might
end
in
a
sentence
of
transportation
for
life
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
without
much
hesitation
,
embraced
the
proposal
of
his
kinsman
,
and
(
as
he
observed
)
was
in
less
than
a
month
after
his
discharge
turned
adrift
to
the
mercy
of
the
wind
and
waves
.
    
<EOS>
Since
that
period
he
had
never
maintained
any
correspondence
with
his
relations
,
all
of
whom
had
concurred
in
sending
him
off
;
nor
would
he
ever
pay
the
least
regard
to
the
humiliations
and
supplications
of
some
among
them
,
who
had
prostrated
themselves
before
him
,
on
the
advancement
of
his
fortune
:
but
he
retained
a
most
inveterate
resentment
for
his
uncle
,
who
was
still
in
being
,
tho
'
extremely
old
and
infirm
,
and
frequently
mentioned
his
name
with
all
the
bitterness
of
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
Perry
being
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
particulars
of
this
story
,
which
he
had
heard
so
often
repeated
,
proposed
to
Hatchway
,
that
a
person
should
be
hired
to
introduce
himself
to
the
commodore
,
with
a
supposititious
letter
of
recommendation
from
this
detested
kinsman
;
an
imposition
that
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
afford
abundance
of
diversion
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
relished
the
scheme
,
and
young
Pickle
having
composed
an
epistle
for
the
occasion
,
the
exciseman
of
the
parish
,
a
fellow
of
great
impudence
and
some
humour
,
in
whom
Hatchway
could
confide
,
undertook
to
transcribe
and
deliver
it
with
his
own
hand
,
and
also
personate
the
man
in
whose
favour
it
was
feigned
to
be
writ
.
<EOS>
He
,
accordingly
,
one
morning
arrived
on
horseback
at
the
garrison
,
two
hours
at
least
before
Trunnion
used
to
get
up
,
and
gave
Pipes
,
who
admitted
him
,
to
understand
,
that
he
had
a
letter
for
his
master
,
which
he
was
ordered
to
deliver
to
none
but
the
commodore
himself
.
<EOS>
This
message
was
no
sooner
communicated
,
than
the
indignant
chief
(
who
had
been
waked
for
the
purpose
)
began
to
curse
the
messenger
for
breaking
his
rest
,
and
swore
he
would
not
budge
till
his
usual
time
of
turning
out
.
    
<EOS>
This
resolution
being
conveyed
to
the
stranger
,
he
desired
the
carrier
to
go
back
and
tell
him
,
he
had
such
joyful
tidings
to
impart
,
that
he
was
sure
the
commodore
would
think
himself
amply
rewarded
for
his
trouble
,
even
if
he
had
been
raised
from
the
grave
to
receive
them
.
    
<EOS>
This
assurance
,
flattering
as
it
was
,
would
not
have
been
powerful
enough
to
persuade
him
,
had
it
not
been
assisted
with
the
exhortations
of
his
spouse
,
which
never
failed
to
influence
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
crept
out
of
bed
,
tho
'
not
without
great
repugnance
,
and
wrapping
himself
in
his
morning
-
gown
,
was
supported
down
stairs
,
rubbing
his
eye
,
yawning
fearfully
,
and
grumbling
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
popt
his
head
into
the
parlour
,
the
supposed
stranger
made
divers
awkward
bows
,
and
with
a
grinning
aspect
accosted
him
in
these
words
:
"
Your
most
humble
servant
,
most
noble
commodore
!
<EOS>
I
hope
you
are
in
good
health
;
you
look
pure
and
hearty
;
and
if
it
was
not
for
that
misfortune
of
your
eye
,
one
would
not
desire
to
see
a
more
pleasant
countenance
in
a
summer
's
day
.
<EOS>
Sure
as
I
am
a
living
soul
,
one
would
take
you
to
be
on
this
side
of
three
-
score
.
<EOS>
Laud
help
us
!
<EOS>
I
should
have
known
you
to
be
a
Trunnion
if
I
had
met
with
you
in
the
midst
of
Salisbury
-
plain
,
as
the
saying
is
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
who
was
not
at
all
in
the
humour
of
relishing
such
an
impertinent
preamble
,
interrupted
him
in
this
place
,
saying
with
a
peevish
accent
,
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
pshaw
!
<EOS>
brother
,
there
's
no
occasion
to
bowss
out
so
much
unnecessary
gum
;
if
you
ca
n't
bring
your
discourse
to
bear
on
the
right
subject
,
you
had
much
better
clap
a
stopper
on
your
tongue
,
and
bring
yourself
up
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
:
<EOS>
I
was
told
you
had
something
to
deliver
.
"
<EOS>
"
Deliver
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
waggish
impostor
)
odds
heart
!
    
<EOS>
I
have
got
something
for
you
that
will
make
your
very
intrails
rejoice
within
your
body
.
<EOS>
Here
's
a
letter
from
a
dear
and
worthy
friend
of
yours
.
<EOS>
Take
,
read
it
and
be
happy
.
<EOS>
Blessings
on
his
old
heart
!
<EOS>
one
would
think
he
had
renewed
his
age
,
like
the
eagles
.
<EOS>
"
Trunnion
's
expectation
being
thus
raised
,
he
called
for
his
spectacles
,
adjusted
them
to
his
eye
,
took
the
letter
,
and
being
curious
to
know
the
subscription
,
no
sooner
perceived
his
uncle
's
name
,
than
he
started
back
,
his
lip
quivered
,
and
he
began
to
shake
in
every
limb
with
resentment
and
surprize
:
nevertheless
,
eager
to
know
the
subject
of
an
epistle
from
a
person
who
had
never
before
troubled
him
with
any
sort
of
address
,
he
endeavoured
to
recollect
himself
,
and
perused
the
contents
,
which
were
these
:
    
"
Loving
Nephew
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
but
you
will
be
rejoiced
to
hear
of
my
welfare
;
and
well
you
may
,
considering
what
a
kind
uncle
I
have
been
to
you
in
the
days
of
your
youth
,
and
how
little
you
deserved
any
such
thing
;
for
you
was
always
a
graceless
young
man
,
given
to
wicked
courses
and
bad
company
,
whereby
you
would
have
come
to
a
shameful
end
,
had
it
not
been
for
my
care
in
sending
you
out
of
mischief
's
way
.
<EOS>
But
this
is
not
the
cause
of
my
present
writing
.
<EOS>
The
bearer
,
Mr
Timothy
Trickle
,
is
a
distant
relation
of
yours
,
being
the
son
of
the
cousin
of
your
aunt
Margery
,
and
is
not
over
and
above
<EOS>
well
as
to
worldly
matters
.
<EOS>
He
thinks
of
going
to
London
,
to
see
for
some
post
in
the
excise
or
customs
,
if
so
be
that
you
will
recommend
him
to
some
great
man
of
your
acquaintance
,
and
give
him
a
small
matter
to
keep
him
till
he
is
provided
.
    
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
,
nephew
,
but
you
will
be
glad
to
serve
him
,
if
it
was
no
more
but
for
the
respect
you
bear
to
me
,
who
am
,
 
Loving
Nephew
,
Your
affectionate
Uncle
,
and
Servant
to
command

Tobiah
Trunnion

"
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
a
difficult
task
for
the
inimitable
Hogarth
himself
to
exhibit
the
ludicrous
expression
of
the
commodore
's
countenance
,
while
he
read
this
letter
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
stare
of
astonishment
,
a
convulsion
of
rage
,
or
a
ghastly
grin
of
revenge
,
but
an
association
of
all
three
,
that
took
possession
of
his
features
.
<EOS>
At
length
he
hawked
up
,
with
incredible
straining
,
the
interjection
ah
!
<EOS>
that
seemed
to
have
stuck
some
time
in
his
windpipe
,
and
thus
gave
vent
to
his
indignation
:
"
Have
I
come
along
side
of
you
at
last
,
you
old
stinking
curmudgeon
!
<EOS>
you
lie
,
<EOS>
you
lousy
hulk
,
ye
lie
!
<EOS>
you
did
all
in
your
power
to
founder
me
when
I
was
a
stripling
;
and
as
for
being
graceless
,
and
wicked
,
and
keeping
bad
company
,
you
tell
a
damned
lie
again
,
you
thief
;
there
was
not
a
more
peaceable
lad
in
the
county
,
and
I
kept
no
bad
company
but
your
own
,
d'ye
see
.
<EOS>
Therefore
,
you
Trickle
,
or
what
's
your
name
,
tell
the
old
rascal
that
sent
you
hither
,
that
I
spit
in
his
face
,
and
call
him
Horse
;
that
I
tear
his
letter
into
rags
,
so
;
and
that
I
trample
upon
it
as
I
would
upon
his
own
villainous
carcase
,
d'ye
see
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
danced
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
upon
the
fragments
of
the
paper
which
he
had
scattered
about
the
room
,
to
the
inexpressible
satisfaction
of
the
triumvirate
,
who
beheld
the
scene
.
    
<EOS>
The
exciseman
having
got
between
him
and
the
door
,
which
was
left
open
for
his
escape
,
in
case
of
necessity
,
affected
great
confusion
and
surprize
at
this
behaviour
,
saying
,
with
an
air
of
mortification
,
"
Lord
,
be
merciful
unto
me
!
<EOS>
is
this
the
way
you
treat
your
own
relations
,
and
the
recommendation
of
your
best
friend
?
<EOS>
Surely
all
gratitude
and
virtue
has
left
this
sinful
world
!
<EOS>
What
will
cousin
Tim
,
and
Dick
,
and
Tom
,
and
good
mother
Pipkin
,
and
her
daughters
,
cousin
Sue

and
Prue

Peg

with
all
the
rest
of
our
kinsfolks
say
,
when
they
hear
of
this
unconscionable
reception
that
I
have
met
with
.
<EOS>
Consider
,
Sir
,
that
ingratitude
is
worse
than
the
sin
of
witchcraft
,
as
the
apostle
wisely
observes
;
and
do
not
send
me
away
with
such
unchristian
usage
,
which
will
lay
a
heavy
load
of
guilt
upon
your
poor
miserable
soul

"
<EOS>
"
What
you
are
on
the
cruize
for
a
post
,
brother
Trickle
,
an't
ye
?
<EOS>
(
said
Trunnion
,
interrupting
him
)
<EOS>
we
shall
find
a
post
for
you
in
a
trice
,
my
boy
.
<EOS>
Here
,
Pipes
,
take
this
saucy
son
of
a
bitch
,
belay
him
to
the
whipping
post
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
I
'll
teach
you
to
rowce
me
in
a
morning
with
such
impertinent
messages
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
who
wanted
to
carry
the
joke
farther
than
the
exciseman
dreamt
of
,
laid
hold
on
him
in
a
twinkling
,
and
executed
the
orders
of
his
commander
,
notwithstanding
all
his
nods
,
winking
,
and
significant
gestures
,
which
the
boatswain
's
mate
would
by
no
means
understand
:
so
that
he
began
to
repent
of
the
part
he
acted
in
this
performance
,
which
was
like
to
end
so
tragically
,
and
stood
fastened
to
the
stake
,
in
a
very
disagreeable
state
of
suspence
;
casting
many
a
rueful
look
over
his
left
shoulder
,
(
while
Pipes
was
absent
in
quest
of
a
cat
and
nine
tails
)
in
expectation
of
being
relieved
by
the
interposition
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
did
not
,
however
,
appear
;
and
Tom
returning
with
the
instrument
of
correction
,
undressed
the
delinquent
in
a
trice
,
and
whispering
in
his
ear
,
that
he
was
very
sorry
for
being
employed
in
such
an
office
,
but
durst
not
for
his
soul
disobey
the
orders
of
his
commander
,
flourished
the
scourge
about
his
head
,
and
with
admirable
dexterity
made
such
a
smarting
application
to
the
offenders
back
and
shoulders
,
that
the
distracted
gauger
performed
sundry
new
cuts
with
his
feet
,
and
bellowed
hideously
with
pain
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
the
spectators
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
when
he
was
almost
flead
from
his
rump
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
,
Hatchway
,
who
had
purposely
absented
himself
hitherto
,
appeared
in
the
yard
,
and
interposing
in
his
behalf
,
prevailed
upon
Trunnion
to
call
off
the
executioner
,
and
order
the
malefactor
to
be
released
.
    
<EOS>
The
exciseman
,
mad
with
the
catastrophe
he
had
undergone
,
threatened
to
be
revenged
upon
his
employers
,
by
making
a
candid
confession
of
the
whole
plot
;
but
the
lieutenant
giving
him
to
understand
,
that
in
so
doing
he
would
bring
upon
himself
a
prosecution
for
fraud
,
forgery
and
imposture
,
he
was
fain
to
put
up
with
his
loss
,
and
sneaked
out
of
the
garrison
,
attended
with
a
volley
of
curses
discharged
upon
him
by
the
commodore
,
who
was
exceedingly
irritated
by
the
disturbance
and
disappointment
he

Chapter
XVII
<EOS>
The
commodore
detects
the
machinations
of
the
conspirators
,
and
hires
a
tutor
for
Peregrine
,
whom
he
settles
at
Winchester
school
.
   
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
last
affliction
he
suffered
from
the
unwearied
endeavours
and
inexhausted
invention
of
his
tormentors
,
who
harrassed
him
with
such
a
variety
of
mischievous
pranks
,
that
he
began
to
think
all
the
devils
in
hell
had
conspired
against
his
peace
;
and
accordingly
became
very
serious
and
contemplative
on
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
his
meditations
,
when
he
recollected
and
compared
the
circumstances
of
every
mortification
to
which
he
had
been
lately
exposed
,
he
could
not
help
suspecting
that
some
of
them
must
have
been
contrived
to
vex
him
;
and
as
he
was
not
ignorant
of
his
lieutenant
's
disposition
,
nor
unacquainted
with
the
talents
of
Peregrine
,
he
resolved
to
observe
them
both
for
the
future
with
the
utmost
care
and
circumspection
.
<EOS>
This
resolution
,
aided
by
the
incautious
conduct
of
the
conspirators
,
whom
,
by
this
time
,
success
had
rendered
heedless
and
indiscreet
,
was
attended
with
the
desired
effect
.
<EOS>
He
in
a
little
time
detected
Perry
in
a
new
plot
,
and
by
dint
of
a
little
chastisement
,
and
a
great
many
threats
,
extorted
from
him
a
consession
of
all
the
contrivances
in
which
he
had
been
concerned
.
    
<EOS>
The
commodore
was
thunderstruck
at
the
discovery
,
and
so
much
incensed
against
Hatchway
for
the
part
he
had
acted
in
the
whole
,
that
he
deliberated
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
demand
satisfaction
with
sword
and
pistol
,
or
dismiss
him
from
the
garison
,
and
renounce
all
friendship
with
him
at
once
.
<EOS>
But
he
had
been
so
long
accustomed
to
Jack
's
company
,
that
he
could
not
live
without
him
;
and
upon
more
cool
reflection
,
perceiving
that
what
he
had
done
was
rather
the
effect
of
wantonness
than
malice
,
which
he
himself
would
have
laughed
to
see
take
place
upon
any
other
person
,
he
determined
to
devour
his
chagrin
,
and
extend
his
forgiveness
even
to
Pipes
,
whom
in
the
first
sally
of
his
passion
he
had
looked
upon
in
a
more
criminal
light
than
that
of
a
simple
mutineer
.
<EOS>
This
determination
was
seconded
by
another
,
which
he
thought
absolutely
necessary
for
his
own
repose
,
and
in
which
his
own
interest
and
that
of
his
nephew
concurred
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
now
turned
of
twelve
,
had
made
such
advances
under
the
instruction
of
Jennings
,
that
he
often
disputed
upon
grammar
,
and
was
sometimes
thought
to
have
the
better
in
his
contests
with
the
parish
-
priest
,
who
,
notwithstanding
this
acknowledged
superiority
of
his
antagonist
,
did
great
justice
to
his
genius
,
which
he
assured
Mr
Trunnion
would
be
lost
for
want
of
cultivation
,
if
the
boy
was
not
immediately
sent
to
prosecute
his
studies
at
some
proper
seminary
of
learning
.
    
<EOS>
This
maxim
had
more
than
once
been
inculcated
upon
the
commodore
by
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
,
over
and
above
the
deference
she
paid
to
the
parson
's
opinion
,
had
a
reason
of
her
own
for
wishing
to
see
the
house
clear
of
Peregrine
,
at
whose
prying
disposition
she
began
to
be
very
uneasy
.
    
<EOS>
Induced
by
these
motive
,
which
were
joined
by
the
sollicitation
of
the
youth
himself
,
who
ardently
longed
to
see
a
little
more
of
the
world
,
his
uncle
determined
to
send
him
forthwith
to
Winchester
,
under
the
immediate
care
and
inspection
of
a
governor
,
to
whom
he
allowed
a
very
handsome
appointment
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
whose
name
was
Mr
Jacob
Jolter
,
had
been
schoolfellow
with
the
parson
of
the
parish
,
who
recommended
him
to
Mrs
Trunnion
as
a
person
of
great
worth
and
learning
,
in
every
respect
qualified
for
the
office
of
a
tutor
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
added
,
by
way
of
eulogium
,
that
he
was
a
man
of
exemplary
piety
,
and
particularly
zealous
for
the
honour
of
the
church
of
which
he
was
a
member
,
having
been
many
years
in
holy
orders
,
tho
'
he
did
not
then
exercise
any
function
of
the
priesthood
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Mr
Jolter
's
zeal
was
so
exceedingly
fervent
,
as
,
on
some
occasions
,
to
get
the
better
of
his
discretion
:
for
,
being
an
high
-
churchman
,
and
of
consequence
<EOS>
a
malecontent
,
his
resentment
was
habituated
into
an
insurmountable
prejudice
against
the
present
disposition
of
affairs
,
which
,
by
confounding
the
nation
with
the
ministry
,
sometimes
led
him
into
erroneous
,
not
to
say
absurd
calculations
;
otherwise
,
a
man
of
good
morals
,
well
versed
in
mathematicks
and
school
-
divinity
,
studies
which
had
not
at
all
contributed
to
sweeten
and
unbend
the
natural
sourness
and
severity
of
his
complexion
.
    
<EOS>
This
gentleman
being
destined
to
the
charge
of
superintending
Perry
's
education
,
every
thing
was
prepared
for
their
departure
;
and
Tom
Pipes
,
in
consequence
of
his
own
petition
,
put
into
livery
,
and
appointed
footman
to
the
young
squire
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
before
they
set
out
,
the
commodore
paid
the
compliment
of
communicating
his
design
to
Mr
Pickle
,
who
approved
of
the
plan
,
tho
'
he
durst
not
venture
to
see
the
boy
;
so
much
was
he
intimidated
by
the
remonstrances
of
his
wife
,
whose
aversion
to
her
first
-
born
became
every
day
more
inveterate
and
unaccountable
.
<EOS>
This
unnatural
caprice
seemed
to
be
supported
by
a
consideration
which
(
one
would
imagine
)
might
have
rather
vanquished
her
disgust
.
<EOS>
Her
second
son
Gam
,
who
was
now
in
the
fourth
year
of
his
age
,
had
been
ricketty
from
the
cradle
,
and
as
remarkably
unpromising
in
appearance
as
Perry
was
agreeable
in
his
person
.
<EOS>
As
the
deformity
increased
,
the
mother
's
fondness
was
augmented
,
and
the
virulence
of
her
hate
against
the
other
son
seemed
to
prevail
in
the
same
proportion
.
    
<EOS>
Far
from
allowing
Perry
to
enjoy
the
common
privileges
of
a
child
,
she
would
not
suffer
him
to
approach
his
father
's
house
,
expressed
uneasiness
whenever
his
name
happened
to
be
mentioned
,
sickened
at
his
praise
,
and
in
all
respects
behaved
like
a
most
rancorous
step
-
mother
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
she
no
longer
retained
that
ridiculous
notion
of
his
being
an
impostor
,
she
still
continued
to
abhor
him
,
as
if
she
really
believed
him
to
be
such
;
and
when
any
person
desired
to
know
the
cause
of
her
surprising
dislike
,
she
always
lost
her
temper
,
and
peevishly
replied
,
that
she
had
reasons
of
her
own
,
which
she
was
not
obliged
to
declare
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
much
was
she
infected
by
this
vicious
partiality
,
that
she
broke
off
all
commerce
with
her
sister
-
in
-
law
and
the
commodore
,
because
they
favoured
the
poor
child
with
their
countenance
and
protection
.
    
<EOS>
Her
malice
,
however
,
was
frustrated
by
the
love
and
generosity
of
Trunnion
,
who
having
adopted
him
as
his
own
son
,
equipped
him
accordingly
,
and
carried
him
and
his
governor
in
his
own
coach
to
the
place
of
destination
,
where
they
were
settled
on
a
very
genteel
footing
,
and
every
thing
regulated
according
to
their
desires
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
behaved
with
great
decency
at
the
departure
of
her
nephew
,
to
whom
,
with
a
great
many
pious
advices
,
and
injunctions
to
behave
with
submission
and
reverence
towards
his
tutor
,
she
presented
a
diamond
ring
of
small
value
,
and
a
gold
medal
,
as
tokens
of
her
affection
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
lieutenant
,
he
accompanied
them
in
the
coach
;
and
such
was
the
friendship
he
had
contracted
for
Perry
,
that
when
the
commodore
proposed
to
return
,
after
having
accomplished
the
intent
of
his
journey
,
Jack
absolutely
refused
to
attend
him
,
and
signified
his
resolution
to
stay
where
he
was
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
was
the
more
startled
at
this
declaration
,
as
Hatchway
was
become
so
necessary
to
him
in
almost
all
the
purposes
of
his
life
,
that
he
foresaw
he
should
not
be
able
to
exist
without
his
company
.
<EOS>
Not
a
little
affected
with
this
consideration
,
he
turned
his
eye
ruefully
upon
the
lieutenant
,
saying
in
a
piteous
tone
,
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
leave
me
at
last
,
Jack
,
after
we
have
weathered
so
many
hard
gales
together
?
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
my
limbs
!
<EOS>
I
thought
you
had
been
more
of
an
honest
heart
:
I
looked
upon
you
as
my
foremast
,
and
Tom
Pipes
as
my
mizzen
;
now
he
is
carried
away
,
if
so
be
as
you
go
too
,
my
standing
rigging
being
decayed
,
d'ye
see
,
the
first
squall
will
bring
me
by
the
board
.
<EOS>
D####n
ye
,
if
in
case
I
have
given
offence
,
ca
n't
ye
speak
above
-
board
?
<EOS>
and
I
shall
make
you
amends
.
"
    
<EOS>
Jack
being
ashamed
to
own
the
true
situation
of
his
thoughts
,
after
some
hesitation
,
answered
with
perplexity
and
incoherence
,
"
No
,
damme
!
<EOS>
that
an't
<EOS>
the
case
neither
:
to
be
sure
you
always
used
me
in
an
officer
-
like
manner
,
that
I
must
own
,
to
give
the
devil
his
due
,
as
the
saying
is
;
<EOS>
but
for
all
that
,
this
here
is
the
case
,
I
have
some
thoughts
of
going
to
school
myself
to
learn
your
Latin
lingo
;
for
,
as
the
saying
is
,
Better
late
mend
than
never
do
well
:
<EOS>
and
I
am
informed
as
how
one
can
get
more
for
the
money
here
than
any
where
else
.
"
    
<EOS>
In
vain
did
Trunnion
endeavour
to
convince
him
of
the
folly
of
going
to
school
at
his
years
,
by
representing
that
the
boys
would
make
game
of
him
,
and
that
he
would
become
a
laughing
-
stock
to
all
the
world
;
he
persisted
in
his
resolution
to
stay
,
and
the
commodore
was
fain
to
have
recourse
to
the
mediation
of
Pipes
and
Perry
,
who
employed
their
influence
with
Jack
,
and
at
last
prevailed
upon
him
to
return
to
the
garison
,
after
Trunnion
had
promised
he
should
be
at
liberty
to
visit
them
once
a
month
.
<EOS>
This
stipulation
being
settled
,
he
and
his
friend
took
leave
of
the
pupil
,
governor
and
attendant
,
and
next
morning
set
out
for
their
habitation
,
which
they
reached
in
safety
that
same
night
.
    
<EOS>
Such
was
Hatchway
's
reluctance
to
leave
Peregrine
,
that
he
is
said
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
to
have
looked
misty
at
parting
:
certain
I
am
,
that
on
the
road
homewards
,
after
a
long
pause
of
silence
,
which
the
commodore
never
dreamt
of
interrupting
,
he
exclaimed
all
of
a
sudden
,
"
I
'll
be
damned
if
the
dog
han't
given
me
some
stuff
to
make
me
love
him
.
"
    
<EOS>
Indeed
there
was
something
congenial
in
the
disposition
of
these
two
friends
,
which
never
failed
to
manifest
itself
in
the
sequel
,
howsoever
different
<EOS>
their
education
,
circumstances
and
connexions
happened
to
be
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XVIII
Peregrine
distinguishes
himself
among
his
school
-
fellows
,
exposes
his
tutor
,
and
attracts
the
particular
notice
of
the
master
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
left
to
the
prosecution
of
his
studies
,
Peregrine
was
in
a
little
time
a
distinguished
character
,
not
only
for
his
acuteness
of
apprehension
,
but
also
for
that
mischievous
fertility
of
fancy
,
of
which
we
have
already
given
such
pregnant
examples
.
<EOS>
But
as
there
was
a
great
number
of
such
luminaries
in
this
new
sphere
to
which
he
belonged
,
his
talents
were
not
so
conspicuous
,
while
they
shone
in
his
single
capacity
,
as
they
afterwards
appeared
,
when
they
concentrated
and
reflected
the
rays
of
the
whole
constellation
.
    
<EOS>
At
first
he
confined
himself
to
piddling
game
,
exercising
his
genius
upon
his
own
tutor
,
who
attracted
this
attention
,
by
endeavouring
to
season
his
mind
with
certain
political
maxims
,
the
fallacy
of
which
he
had
discernment
enough
to
perceive
.
<EOS>
Scarce
a
day
passed
,
on
which
he
did
not
find
means
to
render
Mr
Jolter
the
object
of
ridicule
;
his
violent
prejudices
,
ludicrous
vanity
,
aukward
solemnity
and
ignorance
of
mankind
,
afforded
continual
food
for
the
raillery
,
petulance
and
satire
of
his
pupil
,
who
never
neglected
an
opportunity
of
laughing
,
and
making
others
laugh
at
his
expence
.
    
<EOS>
Sometimes
in
their
parties
,
by
mixing
brandy
in
his
wine
,
he
decoyed
this
pedagogue
into
a
debauch
,
during
which
his
caution
forsook
him
,
and
he
exposed
himself
to
the
censure
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
,
when
the
conversation
turned
upon
intricate
subjects
,
he
practised
upon
him
the
Socratic
method
of
confutation
,
and
,
under
pretence
of
being
informed
,
by
an
artful
train
of
puzzling
questions
,
insensibly
betrayed
him
into
self
-
contradiction
:
and
at
one
time
he
,
in
a
most
dexterous
manner
,
set
on
foot
a
correspondence
between
him
and
the
chambermaid
of
the
house
,
which
ended
in
his
utter
shame
and
confusion
.
<EOS>
The
wench
was
handsome
,
Jolter
was
frail
;
and
one
evening
,
while
in
his
cups
,
beheld
her
with
a
carnal
eye
.
    
<EOS>
Perry
,
who
was
ever
on
the
catch
,
discovered
his
longing
,
and
prevailed
upon
the
object
of
his
passion
to
feed
his
flame
with
small
favours
,
until
it
became
too
violent
to
be
restrained
:
he
then
urged
his
addresses
with
redoubled
ardor
,
promised
,
vowed
,
bribed
and
intreated
;
the
inamorata
seemed
to
yield
,
and
blessed
him
with
a
declaration
,
that
her
chamber
-
door
should
be
left
open
at
midnight
.
    
<EOS>
True
to
the
assignation
,
he
rose
at
the
hour
appointed
,
and
full
of
the
most
vigorous
expectation
,
in
his
shirt
,
darkling
explored
his
way
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
.
    
<EOS>
His
heart
throbbed
with
joy
when
he
found
immediate
admittance
;
he
saw
the
cap
of
his
Dulcinea
,
who
seemed
to
be
asleep
;
he
sprung
into
bed
,
and
clasped
in
his
arms
 
<EOS>
oh
heavens
!
<EOS>
no
other
than
the
traitor
Pipes
,
who
,
by
his
master
's
direction
,
personated
the
maid
;
and
returned
the
embrace
with
such
muscular
contraction
,
that
the
unfortunate
lover
felt
the
disappointment
,
and
the
impossibility
of
disengaging
himself
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
His
malicious
pupil
,
attended
by
another
scholar
who
lived
in
the
same
house
,
and
the
fly
jilt
who
was
the
cause
of
this
disaster
,
immediately
entered
the
room
with
lights
,
and
detected
the
forlorn
governor
in
all
the
mortification
of
disgrace
.
    
<EOS>
This
adventure
destroyed
all
the
remains
of
authority
which
he
had
hitherto
preserved
over
Peregrine
;
so
that
,
for
the
future
,
no
sort
of
ceremony
subsisted
between
them
,
and
all
Mr
Jolter
's
precepts
were
conveyed
in
hints
of
friendly
advice
,
which
the
other
might
either
follow
or
neglect
at
his
own
pleasure
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
that
Peregrine
gave
a
loose
to
his
inclinations
,
and
by
dint
of
genius
and
an
enterprising
temper
,
made
a
figure
among
the
younger
class
of
heroes
in
the
college
.
    
<EOS>
Before
he
had
been
a
full
year
at
Winchester
,
he
had
signalized
himself
in
so
many
atchievements
,
in
defiance
to
the
laws
and
regulations
of
the
place
,
that
he
was
looked
upon
with
admiration
,
and
actually
chosen
Dux
,
or
leader
,
by
a
large
body
of
his
contemporaries
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
his
fame
reached
the
ears
of
the
master
,
who
sent
for
Mr
Jolter
,
communicated
to
him
the
information
he
had
received
,
and
desired
him
to
check
the
vivacity
of
his
charge
,
and
redouble
his
vigilance
in
time
to
come
,
else
he
should
be
obliged
to
make
a
public
example
of
his
pupil
for
the
benefit
of
the
school
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
,
conscious
of
his
own
unimportance
,
was
not
a
little
disconcerted
at
this
injunction
,
which
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
fulfil
by
any
compulsive
means
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
went
home
in
a
very
pensive
mood
,
and
after
mature
deliberation
,
resolved
to
expostulate
with
Peregrine
in
the
most
familiar
terms
,
and
endeavour
to
dissuade
him
from
practices
which
might
affect
his
character
as
well
as
interest
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
frankly
told
him
the
subject
of
the
master
's
discourse
,
represented
the
disgrace
he
might
incur
by
neglecting
this
warning
;
and
putting
him
in
mind
of
his
own
situation
,
hinted
the
consequences
of
the
commodore
's
displeasure
,
in
case
he
should
be
brought
to
disapprove
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
These
insinuations
made
the
greater
impression
,
as
they
were
delivered
with
many
expressions
of
friendship
and
concern
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
not
so
raw
,
but
that
he
could
perceive
the
solidity
of
Mr
Jolter
's
advice
,
to
which
he
promised
to
conform
,
because
his
pride
was
interested
in
the
affair
;
and
he
considered
his
own
reformation
as
the
only
means
of
avoiding
that
infamy
which
even
in
idea
he
could
not
bear
.
    
<EOS>
His
governor
finding
him
so
reasonable
,
profited
by
these
moments
of
reflection
,
and
<EOS>
in
order
to
prevent
a
relapse
,
proposed
that
he
should
engage
in
some
delightful
study
that
would
agreeably
amuse
his
imagination
,
and
gradually
detach
him
from
those
connexions
which
had
involved
him
in
so
many
troublesome
adventures
.
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
,
he
,
with
many
rapturous
encomiums
,
recommended
the
mathematics
,
as
yielding
more
rational
and
sensible
pleasure
to
a
youthful
fancy
than
any
other
subject
of
contemplation
;
and
actually
began
to
read
Euclid
with
him
that
same
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
entered
upon
this
branch
of
learning
with
all
that
warmth
of
application
which
boys
commonly
yield
on
the
first
change
of
study
;
but
he
had
scarce
advanced
beyond
the
Pons
Asinorum
,
when
his
ardor
abated
,
the
test
of
truth
by
demonstration
did
not
elevate
him
to
those
transports
of
joy
with
which
his
preceptor
had
regaled
his
expectation
;
and
before
he
arrived
at
the
fortieth
and
seventh
proposition
,
he
began
to
yawn
drearily
,
make
abundance
of
wry
faces
,
and
thought
himself
but
indifferently
paid
for
his
attention
,
when
he
shared
the
vast
discovery
of
Pythagoras
,
and
understood
that
the
square
of
the
hypothenuse
was
equal
to
the
squares
of
the
other
two
sides
of
a
right
-
angled
triangle
.
<EOS>
He
was
ashamed
,
however
,
to
fail
in
his
undertaking
,
and
persevered
with
great
industry
,
until
he
had
finished
the
first
four
books
,
acquired
plain
trigonometry
,
with
the
method
of
algebraical
calculation
,
and
made
himself
well
acquainted
with
the
principles
of
surveying
.
<EOS>
But
no
consideration
could
prevail
upon
him
to
extend
his
inquiries
farther
in
this
science
;
and
he
returned
with
double
relish
to
his
former
avocations
,
like
a
stream
which
being
dammed
,
accumulates
more
force
,
and
bursting
o'er
its
mounds
,
rushes
down
with
double
impetuosity
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
saw
with
astonishment
and
chagrin
,
but
could
not
resist
the
torrent
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
was
now
no
other
than
a
series
of
licence
and
effrontery
;
prank
succeeded
prank
,
and
outrage
followed
outrage
with
surprising
velocity
.
    
<EOS>
Complaints
were
every
day
preferred
against
him
;
in
vain
were
admonitions
bestowed
by
the
governor
in
private
,
and
menaces
discharged
by
the
masters
in
publick
;
he
disregarded
the
first
,
despised
the
latter
,
divested
himself
of
all
manner
of
restraint
,
and
proceeded
in
his
career
to
such
a
pitch
of
audacity
,
that
a
consultation
was
held
upon
the
subject
,
in
which
it
was
determined
that
this
untoward
spirit
should
be
humbled
by
a
severe
and
ignominious
flogging
for
the
very
next
offence
he
should
commit
;
and
in
the
mean
time
that
Mr
Jolter
should
be
desired
to
write
in
the
master
's
name
to
the
commodore
,
requesting
him
to
remove
Tom
Pipes
from
the
person
of
his
nephew
,
the
said
Pipes
being
a
principal
actor
and
abettor
in
all
his
malversations
;
and
to
put
a
stop
to
the
monthly
visitations
of
the
mutilated
lieutenant
,
who
had
never
once
failed
to
use
his
permission
,
but
came
punctual
to
a
day
,
always
fraught
with
some
new
invention
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
by
this
time
,
Mr
Hatchway
was
as
well
known
,
and
much
better
beloved
by
every
boy
in
the
school
than
the
master
who
instructed
him
,
and
always
received
by
a
number
of
the
scholars
who
used
to
attend
Peregrine
when
he
went
forth
to
meet
his
friend
,
and
conduct
him
to
his
lodging
with
public
testimonies
of
joy
and
applause
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
Tom
Pipes
<EOS>
he
was
not
so
properly
the
attendant
of
Peregrine
,
as
master
of
the
revels
to
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
He
mingled
in
all
their
parties
,
and
superintended
the
diversions
,
deciding
between
boy
and
boy
,
as
if
he
acted
by
commission
under
the
great
seal
.
    
<EOS>
He
regulated
their
motions
by
his
whistle
,
instructed
the
young
boys
in
the
games
of
hussle
-
cap
,
leap
-
frog
,
and
chuck
farthing
;
imparted
to
those
of
a
more
advanced
age
the
sciences
of
cribbidge
and
all
-
fours
,
together
with
the
method
of
storming
the
castle
,
acting
the
comedy
of
Prince
Arthur
,
and
other
pantomimes
,
as
they
are
commonly
exhibited
at
sea
;
and
instructed
the
seniors
who
were
distinguished
by
the
appellation
of
bloods
,
in
cudgel
playing
,
dancing
the
St
Giles
's
hornpipe
,
drinking
flip
and
smoaking
tobacco
.
<EOS>
These
qualifications
had
rendered
him
so
necessary
and
acceptable
to
the
scholars
,
that
exclusive
of
Perry
's
concern
in
the
affair
,
his
dismission
in
all
probability
,
would
have
produced
some
dangerous
convulsion
in
the
community
.
<EOS>
Jolter
,
therefore
,
knowing
his
importance
,
informed
his
pupil
of
the
directions
he
had
received
,
and
very
candidly
asked
how
he
should
demean
himself
in
the
execution
;
for
he
durst
not
write
to
the
commodore
without
this
previous
notice
,
fearing
that
the
young
gentleman
,
as
soon
as
he
should
get
an
inkling
of
the
affair
,
would
follow
the
example
,
and
make
his
uncle
acquainted
with
certain
anecdotes
,
which
it
was
the
governor
's
interest
to
keep
concealed
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
of
opinion
that
he
should
spare
himself
the
trouble
of
conveying
any
complaints
to
the
commodore
;
and
if
questioned
by
the
master
,
assure
him
he
had
complied
with
his
desire
;
at
the
same
time
he
promised
faithfully
to
conduct
himself
with
such
circumspection
for
the
future
,
that
the
masters
should
have
no
temptation
to
revive
the
inquiry
.
<EOS>
But
the
resolution
attending
this
extorted
promise
was
too
frail
to
last
,
and
in
less
than
a
fortnight
our
young
hero
found
himself
intangled
in
an
adventure
from
which
he
was
not
extricated
with
his
usual
good
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XIX
<EOS>
He
is
concerned
in
a
dangerous
adventure
with
a
certain
gardener
;
heads
an
insurrection
in
the
school
;
takes
the
field
with
his
adherents
,
marches
up
into
the
country
,
and
fixes
his
head
quarters
at
an
inn
.
   
<EOS>
He
and
some
of
his
companions
one
day
entered
a
garden
in
the
suburbs
,
and
having
indulged
their
appetites
,
desired
to
know
what
satisfaction
they
must
make
for
the
fruit
they
had
pulled
.
<EOS>
The
gardener
demanded
what
(
in
their
opinion
)
was
an
exorbitant
price
,
and
they
with
many
opprobious
terms
refused
to
pay
it
.
<EOS>
The
peasant
being
surly
and
intractable
,
insisted
upon
his
right
;
neither
was
he
deficient
or
sparing
in
the
eloquence
of
vulgar
abuse
.
<EOS>
His
guests
attempted
to
retreat
,
a
scuffle
ensued
,
in
which
Peregrine
lost
his
cap
,
and
the
gardener
being
in
danger
from
the
number
of
his
foes
,
called
to
his
wife
to
let
loose
the
dog
,
who
instantly
flew
to
his
master
's
assistance
;
and
after
having
tore
the
leg
of
one
,
and
the
shoulder
of
another
,
put
the
whole
body
of
scholars
to
flight
.
<EOS>
Enraged
at
the
indignity
which
had
been
offered
to
them
,
they
solicited
a
reinforcement
of
their
friends
,
and
with
Tom
Pipes
at
their
head
,
marched
back
to
the
field
of
battle
.
<EOS>
Their
adversary
seeing
them
approach
,
called
his
apprentice
,
who
worked
at
the
other
end
of
the
ground
,
to
his
assistance
,
armed
him
with
a
mattock
,
while
he
himself
wielded
an
hoe
,
bolted
his
door
on
the
inside
,
and
flanked
with
his
man
and
mastiff
,
waited
the
attack
without
flinching
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
not
remained
three
minutes
in
this
posture
of
defence
,
when
Pipes
,
who
acted
as
the
enemy
's
forlorn
hope
,
advanced
to
the
gate
with
great
intrepidity
,
and
clapping
his
foot
to
the
door
,
which
was
none
of
the
stoutest
,
with
the
execution
and
dispatch
of
a
petard
,
split
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
.
<EOS>
This
sudden
execution
had
an
immediate
effect
upon
the
'
prentice
,
who
retreated
with
great
precipitation
,
and
escaped
at
a
postern
gate
.
<EOS>
But
the
master
placed
himself
like
another
Hercules
in
the
breach
;
and
when
Pipes
brandishing
his
cudgel
,
stepped
forward
to
engage
him
,
levelled
his
weapon
with
such
force
and
dexterity
at
his
head
,
that
had
the
skull
been
made
of
penetrable
stuff
,
the
iron
edge
must
have
cleft
his
pate
in
twain
.
<EOS>
Casemated
as
he
was
,
the
instrument
cut
sheer
even
to
the
bone
,
on
which
it
struck
with
such
amazing
violence
,
that
sparks
of
real
fire
were
produced
by
the
collision
.
<EOS>
And
let
not
the
incredulous
reader
pretend
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
phaenomenon
,
until
he
shall
have
first
perused
the
ingenious
Peter
Kolben
's
Natural
History
of
the
Cape
of
Good
Hope
,
where
the
inhabitants
commonly
use
to
strike
fire
with
the
shin
-
bones
of
lions
which
have
been
killed
in
that
part
of
Africk
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
though
a
little
disconcerted
,
far
from
being
disabled
by
the
blow
,
in
a
trice
retorted
the
compliment
with
his
truncheon
,
<EOS>
which
,
had
not
his
antagonist
expeditiously
slipped
his
head
aside
,
would
have
laid
him
breathless
across
his
own
threshold
;
but
,
happily
for
him
,
he
received
the
salutation
upon
his
right
shoulder
,
which
crashed
beneath
the
stroke
,
and
the
hoe
dropped
instantly
from
his
tingling
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
perceiving
,
and
being
unwilling
to
forego
the
advantage
he
had
gained
,
darted
his
head
into
the
bosom
of
this
son
of
earth
,
and
overturned
him
on
the
plain
,
being
himself
that
instant
assaulted
by
the
mastif
,
who
fastened
upon
the
outside
of
his
thigh
.
<EOS>
Feeling
himself
incommoded
by
this
assailant
in
his
rear
,
he
quitted
the
prostrate
gardener
to
the
resentment
of
his
associates
,
who
poured
upon
him
in
shoals
,
and
turning
about
,
laid
hold
with
both
his
hands
of
this
ferocious
animal
's
throat
,
which
he
squeezed
with
such
incredible
force
and
perseverance
,
that
the
creature
quitted
his
hold
;
his
tongue
lolled
out
of
his
jaws
,
the
blood
started
from
his
eyes
,
and
he
swung
a
lifeless
trunk
between
the
hands
of
his
vanquisher
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
well
for
his
master
that
he
did
not
longer
exist
;
for
by
this
time
he
was
overwhelmed
by
such
a
multitude
of
foes
,
that
his
whole
body
scarce
afforded
points
of
contact
to
all
the
fists
that
drummed
upon
it
,
consequently
,
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase
,
his
wind
was
almost
knocked
out
,
before
Pipes
had
leisure
to
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
and
persuade
his
offenders
to
desist
,
by
representing
that
the
wife
had
gone
to
alarm
the
neighbourhood
,
and
that
in
all
probability
,
they
would
be
intercepted
in
their
return
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
listened
to
his
remonstrances
,
and
marched
homewards
in
triumph
,
leaving
the
gardener
in
the
embraces
of
his
mother
earth
,
from
which
he
had
not
power
to
move
when
he
was
found
by
his
disconsolate
helpmate
and
some
friends
whom
she
had
assembled
for
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
Among
these
was
a
blacksmith
and
farrier
,
who
took
cognizance
of
his
carcase
,
every
limb
of
which
having
examined
,
he
declared
there
was
no
bone
broke
,
and
taking
out
his
fleam
,
blooded
him
plentifully
as
he
lay
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
then
conveyed
to
his
bed
,
from
which
he
was
not
able
to
stir
during
a
whole
month
,
and
his
family
coming
upon
the
parish
,
a
formal
complaint
was
made
to
the
master
of
the
college
,
and
Peregrine
represented
as
the
ring
-
leader
of
those
who
committed
this
barbarous
assault
.
<EOS>
An
inquiry
was
immediately
set
on
foot
,
and
the
articles
of
impeachment
being
fully
proved
,
our
hero
was
sentenced
to
be
severely
chastised
in
the
face
of
the
whole
school
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
disgrace
the
thoughts
of
which
his
proud
heart
could
not
brook
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
make
his
elopement
rather
than
undergo
the
punishment
to
which
he
was
doomed
;
and
having
signified
his
sentiments
to
his
confederates
,
they
promised
,
one
and
all
,
to
stand
by
him
,
and
either
screen
him
from
chastisement
,
or
share
his
fate
.
    
<EOS>
Confiding
in
this
friendly
protestation
,
he
appeared
unconcerned
on
the
day
that
was
appointed
for
his
punishment
;
and
when
he
was
called
to
his
destiny
,
advanced
towards
the
scene
,
attended
by
the
greatest
part
of
the
scholars
,
who
intimated
their
determination
to
the
master
,
and
proposed
that
Peregrine
should
be
forgiven
.
<EOS>
The
superior
behaved
with
that
dignity
of
demeanor
which
became
his
place
,
represented
the
folly
and
presumption
of
their
demand
,
reprehended
them
for
their
audacious
proceeding
,
and
ordered
every
boy
to
his
respective
station
;
but
they
had
gone
too
far
to
retract
,
and
instead
of
obeying
the
injunction
they
had
received
,
marched
directly
out
of
the
college
,
with
their
captain
in
the
midst
of
them
,
and
halting
on
a
rising
ground
at
the
distance
of
a
short
mile
from
town
,
held
a
council
to
deliberate
on
what
was
to
be
done
.
    
<EOS>
This
consultation
was
too
tumultuous
to
end
in
any
unanimous
decision
,
so
that
Mr
Pickle
put
himself
at
their
head
,
and
proceeded
straight
forward
till
the
hurry
and
confusion
that
prevailed
among
them
should
subside
;
while
Tom
Pipes
,
who
had
by
this
time
joined
the
company
,
brought
up
the
rear
with
great
calmness
and
tranquillity
,
and
never
once
inquired
into
the
reason
of
this
extraordinary
migration
.
<EOS>
They
pursued
this
indeterminate
course
for
six
miles
,
when
a
public
-
house
presenting
itself
to
their
view
,
there
was
a
proposal
made
to
halt
for
refreshment
,
and
they
disposed
of
themselves
accordingly
,
as
the
conveniencies
of
the
place
would
permit
.
<EOS>
Having
made
a
very
hearty
breakfast
on
bread
and
butter
and
cheese
,
which
they
took
care
to
dilute
with
a
proportionable
quantity
of
ale
;
a
motion
was
made
for
holding
another
board
,
from
which
the
younger
boys
were
excluded
,
that
they
might
,
as
much
as
possible
,
avoid
clamour
and
distraction
in
their
counsels
.
    
<EOS>
Here
Peregrine
being
invested
with
the
supreme
command
,
made
a
public
speech
to
his
constituents
,
wherein
having
thanked
them
for
their
generous
interposition
in
his
favour
,
and
the
great
honour
they
now
conferred
upon
him
,
he
observed
that
in
all
likelihood
,
they
should
in
a
little
time
reap
the
fruits
of
their
resolution
,
and
be
recalled
with
honour
to
the
studies
they
had
left
;
but
as
it
would
be
necessary
to
persevere
a
little
longer
,
that
the
masters
might
see
they
were
not
mere
boys
whom
they
had
disobliged
,
he
proposed
that
they
should
dismiss
the
minor
brothers
who
were
not
capable
of
enduring
a
little
fatigue
,
and
deposit
all
their
money
in
the
hands
of
one
person
who
should
be
chosen
for
that
trust
,
and
to
regulate
their
expence
upon
the
road
;
while
they
advanced
farther
into
the
country
,
and
waited
patiently
for
the
terms
which
would
undoubtedly
be
propounded
unto
them
.
<EOS>
The
proposal
was
unanimously
embraced
,
the
money
produced
,
to
the
amount
of
ten
guineas
,
and
put
into
the
hands
of
Pipes
,
who
was
elected
caterer
and
purser
to
the
whole
community
;
and
the
young
boys
being
exhorted
to
return
,
the
rest
,
to
the
number
of
five
and
twenty
,
departed
under
the
auspices
of
Peregrine
,
who
conducted
them
ten
miles
farther
to
a
certain
village
,
where
they
took
up
their
lodging
at
an
inn
,
and
bespoke
something
hot
for
supper
;
after
which
they
called
for
punch
and
strong
beer
,
and
indulged
themselves
in
such
intemperance
,
that
in
a
little
time
riot
and
disorder
prevailing
,
they
sallied
forth
in
quest
of
willing
dames
to
crown
their
enjoyment
,
and
committed
many
other
excesses
which
the
prudence
and
authority
of
Peregrine
could
not
restrain
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
morning
the
landlord
saved
them
the
trouble
of
calling
for
a
bill
,
and
they
had
the
mortification
to
see
that
their
night
's
extravagance
had
mounted
up
their
expence
to
one
half
of
their
whole
stock
.
<EOS>
They
discharged
the
reckoning
,
and
as
few
or
none
of
them
had
any
inclination
or
appetite
for
breakfast
,
put
themselves
in
motion
,
and
marched
onwards
for
seven
miles
before
they
made
another
halt
.
<EOS>
This
happened
on
the
edge
of
a
common
,
where
they
perceived
the
sign
of
the
George
,
to
the
no
small
comfort
and
satisfaction
of
some
among
them
,
whose
tongues
by
this
time
cleaved
to
the
roofs
of
their
mouths
,
in
consequence
of
the
debauch
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
Here
then
they
paused
,
and
having
moistened
their
throats
with
plentiful
streams
of
ale
,
began
to
relish
the
situation
,
and
ordered
their
steward
to
provide
something
for
dinner
.
    
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
house
would
have
gladly
dispensed
with
their
custom
,
as
they
had
no
great
faith
either
in
the
finances
or
principles
of
their
guests
,
who
seemed
too
young
to
be
possessed
of
much
money
or
consideration
.
<EOS>
But
as
they
lived
in
a
solitary
place
,
unprovided
with
defence
against
the
insults
to
which
they
might
be
exposed
from
the
resentment
of
such
a
disorderly
crowd
,
they
would
not
venture
to
signify
their
distrust
,
and
lamented
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
house
with
which
they
could
entertain
them
.
<EOS>
Tom
Pipes
,
who
had
observed
a
flock
of
geese
upon
the
common
,
and
abundance
of
poultry
in
the
yard
,
took
no
notice
of
the
landlord
's
declaration
,
but
went
out
,
and
in
less
than
five
minutes
returned
with
provision
sufficient
to
regale
twice
the
number
of
his
associates
.
<EOS>
The
woman
durst
not
venture
to
disapprove
of
what
he
had
done
,
but
after
having
assured
him
that
the
fowls
were
none
of
her
own
,
very
peaceably
employed
her
whole
family
in
preparing
them
for
the
fire
,
and
some
bacon
and
greens
being
added
to
the
repast
,
our
company
disposed
themselves
in
different
groups
upon
the
grass
,
and
dined
with
great
mirth
and
satisfaction
,
without
once
recollecting
that
another
such
meal
would
utterly
exhaust
their
common
fund
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
sweet
insensibility
did
not
long
prevail
;
about
four
o'clock
they
called
to
pay
,
and
were
very
much
startled
to
find
themselves
charged
no
less
than
two
pounds
eleven
and
sixpence
for
the
entertainment
they
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
They
looked
upon
this
reckoning
as
unconscionable
,
and
disputed
every
article
accordingly
;
but
the
landlady
solemnly
protested
that
the
sum
would
barely
indemnify
her
,
and
imputed
great
part
of
the
charge
to
the
unnecessary
number
of
geese
and
chickens
which
had
been
slaughtered
without
her
knowledge
or
consent
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
who
on
certain
subjects
,
thought
a
little
too
much
at
large
,
proposed
to
punish
her
for
her
exorbitant
demand
,
by
marching
off
without
paying
one
farthing
;
but
this
advice
Peregrine
declined
with
disdain
,
looking
upon
such
an
expedient
as
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
the
corps
which
he
had
the
honour
to
command
;
and
ordered
that
the
bill
should
be
immediately
discharged
.
<EOS>
This
affair
being
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
concerned
,
they
resumed
their
march
,
and
in
the
evening
arrived
at
a
certain
market
town
,
where
they
resolved
to
fix
their
quarters
until
they
should
hear
tidings
from
the
college
which
they
had
left
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
they
chose
their
residence
at
the
best
inn
belonging
to
the
place
,
and
determined
to
manage
the
remains
of
their
fortune
with
great
frugality
.
<EOS>
But
the
spirits
of
some
amongst
them
beginning
to
flag
,
in
consequence
of
the
fatigue
of
their
journey
,
and
their
own
reflection
that
now
represented
the
folly
of
their
design
,
with
the
uncomfortable
circumstances
that
must
in
a
few
hours
attend
the
consumption
of
their
stock
;
this
prudent
scheme
of
oeconomy
was
over
-
ruled
,
a
huge
bowl
of
punch
prepared
,
and
Pipes
ordered
to
enliven
the
company
with
a
song
.
<EOS>
Their
cares
were
in
a
little
time
overwhelmed
,
and
the
greatest
part
of
the
night
was
consumed
in
mirth
and
jollity
;
though
next
morning
they
waked
in
the
horrors
,
and
universal
despondence
took
place
,
when
they
learnt
that
their
bank
was
scarce
able
to
defray
the
expence
of
their
bill
,
which
they
received
next
their
stomachs
,
and
were
obliged
to
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
They
were
now
reduced
to
a
dilemma
that
occasioned
another
general
consultation
,
in
which
they
agreed
to
club
their
pocket
-
pieces
and
silver
buckles
for
present
support
,
and
give
notice
by
letters
of
their
situation
to
their
respective
relations
,
taking
care
to
ascribe
their
distress
to
the
ill
usage
they
had
met
with
at
school
:
on
this
occasion
Peregrine
produced
the
ring
and
medal
he
had
received
from
Mrs
Trunnion
,
and
Pipes
not
only
presented
his
own
purse
,
which
was
pretty
well
furnished
,
but
even
made
a
proffer
of
his
silver
whistle
,
with
the
chain
by
which
it
had
for
many
years
depended
from
his
neck
.
<EOS>
They
thanked
him
for
his
disinterested
attachment
,
but
all
his
sollicitations
could
not
prevail
upon
the
chiefs
to
profit
by
this
instance
of
his
good
fellowship
;
because
they
considered
him
as
a
person
whose
assistance
in
this
particular
it
was
neither
just
nor
honourable
to
use
.

Chapter
XX
<EOS>
The
governors
tamper
with
their
pupils
.
<EOS>
Peregrineis
deserted
,
prevailed
upon
to
return
,
and
submit
to
correction
;
sublimes
his
ideas
,
commences
gallant
,
and
becomes
acquainted
with
Miss
Emily
Gauntlet
.
   
<EOS>
Mean
while
the
master
,
surprised
and
disconcerted
at
such
an
unprecedented
secession
,
convened
all
the
tutors
of
those
who
were
concerned
in
this
dangerous
association
,
in
order
to
concert
proper
measures
for
recalling
them
;
and
after
mature
deliberation
,
as
it
was
the
opinion
of
every
body
,
that
such
a
number
of
raw
,
hot
-
headed
boys
,
without
money
,
conduct
,
experience
or
plan
,
could
not
possibly
cohere
for
any
length
of
time
<EOS>
,
they
resolved
to
leave
them
to
the
operation
of
their
own
passions
;
not
doubting
that
as
the
first
impulse
gradually
weakened
,
they
would
drop
off
one
by
one
,
and
the
whole
confederacy
be
thus
melted
down
.
<EOS>
The
return
of
the
young
boys
justified
the
prognostic
;
but
the
masters
were
not
a
little
alarmed
,
when
they
understood
that
the
rest
had
chosen
a
general
,
submitted
to
certain
regulations
,
and
adopted
a
determinate
design
.
<EOS>
They
resolved
,
nevertheless
,
to
give
them
a
little
more
scope
,
and
waited
four
and
twenty
hours
for
the
effect
of
their
forbearance
;
when
hearing
no
accounts
from
the
deserters
,
they
began
to
consider
this
revolt
as
a
very
serious
affair
;
and
in
pursuance
of
their
advice
and
direction
,
the
governors
set
out
in
quest
of
their
stray
pupils
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
difficult
to
discover
the
rout
they
had
taken
;
such
a
remarkable
caravan
could
not
pass
unheeded
;
they
got
intimation
of
their
advances
from
stage
to
stage
,
and
at
night
arrived
at
an
inn
that
stood
on
the
road
,
about
two
miles
short
of
the
town
where
the
adventurers
had
settled
their
head
quarters
.
<EOS>
From
hence
they
repaired
in
a
body
to
the
house
of
a
neighbouring
justice
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
their
representations
,
granted
a
warrant
to
apprehend
and
secure
the
body
of
Thomas
Pipes
,
as
an
idle
vagabond
and
seducer
of
youth
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
authorised
,
they
went
early
next
morning
to
the
town
,
and
set
up
their
horses
at
another
inn
,
where
they
remained
incognito
,
until
they
had
engaged
the
constable
with
a
competent
number
of
assistants
;
then
a
person
was
sent
to
inform
Mr
Pipes
,
that
his
company
was
desired
at
the
White
Hart
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
received
this
message
immediately
after
the
contribution
of
effects
,
already
mentioned
;
and
imparted
the
contents
to
his
master
,
who
rightly
judging
that
it
concerned
the
common
cause
,
desired
him
to
obey
the
summons
.
<EOS>
He
followed
the
messenger
accordingly
;
and
no
sooner
set
his
nose
within
the
room
to
which
he
was
directed
,
than
the
constable
and
his
posse
sprung
upon
him
,
before
he
had
the
least
intimation
of
his
design
,
or
any
opportunity
of
acting
in
his
own
defence
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
overpowered
,
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
being
arrested
,
which
,
in
all
appearance
,
did
not
give
him
a
great
deal
of
concern
,
and
in
private
committed
to
jail
,
where
he
was
left
to
his
own
meditations
.
    
<EOS>
This
previous
measure
being
successfully
taken
,
the
tutors
went
into
separate
apartments
,
and
sending
for
their
respective
pupils
,
each
plied
his
own
charge
in
particular
with
such
arguments
as
he
judged
most
conducive
to
dissuade
him
from
persevering
in
the
imprudent
scheme
which
he
had
already
prosecuted
too
far
.
<EOS>
No
great
eloquence
was
required
to
accomplish
this
aim
,
which
was
already
more
than
half
effected
by
their
own
reflections
;
and
therefore
the
greatest
part
of
them
yielded
to
such
reasonable
remonstrances
,
and
consented
to
return
to
school
,
provided
they
might
be
indulged
with
a
general
amnesty
for
what
they
had
done
.
<EOS>
This
they
were
impowered
to
promise
to
all
of
them
,
except
Peregrine
,
whom
,
as
ringleader
and
first
cause
of
this
disturbance
,
the
master
had
marked
out
for
a
public
example
.
    
<EOS>
For
this
reason
he
stood
out
against
all
the
admonitions
of
Mr
Jolter
,
who
in
vain
conjured
him
to
put
up
with
a
little
correction
,
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
being
ignominiously
expelled
,
and
of
forfeiting
the
friendship
of
his
uncle
,
on
whom
he
knew
his
chief
dependance
was
built
;
till
at
length
,
seeing
his
adherents
persuaded
out
of
their
allegiance
,
and
himself
bereft
of
all
company
and
means
of
subsistence
,
he
with
great
reluctance
resigned
himself
to
his
fate
;
and
having
obtained
the
discharge
of
Pipes
,
was
reconducted
to
the
college
,
where
,
notwithstanding
the
intercession
of
his
governor
,
who
begged
earnestly
that
his
punishment
might
be
mitigated
,
our
unfortunate
hero
was
publickly
horsed
,
in
terrorem
of
all
whom
it
might
concern
.
    
<EOS>
This
disgrace
had
a
very
sensible
effect
upon
the
mind
of
Peregrine
,
who
having
,
by
this
time
,
passed
the
fourteenth
year
of
his
age
,
began
to
adopt
the
pride
and
sentiments
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
Thus
dishonourably
stigmatized
,
he
was
ashamed
to
appear
in
public
as
usual
;
he
was
incensed
against
his
companions
for
their
infidelity
and
irresolution
,
and
plunged
into
a
profound
reverie
that
lasted
several
weeks
,
during
which
he
shook
off
his
boyish
connections
,
and
fixed
his
view
upon
objects
which
he
thought
more
worthy
of
his
attention
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
his
gymnastic
exercises
,
at
which
he
was
very
expert
,
he
contracted
intimacies
with
several
youths
who
were
greatly
his
superiors
in
point
of
age
,
and
who
,
pleased
with
his
aspiring
genius
and
address
,
introduced
him
into
parties
of
gallantry
,
which
strongly
captivated
his
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
by
nature
particularly
adapted
for
succeeding
in
adventures
of
this
kind
;
over
and
above
a
most
engaging
person
that
improved
with
his
years
,
he
possessed
a
dignified
assurance
,
an
agreeable
ferocity
which
inhanced
the
conquest
of
the
fair
who
had
the
good
fortune
to
enslave
him
,
unlimited
generosity
,
and
a
fund
of
humour
which
never
failed
to
please
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
deficient
in
the
more
solid
accomplishments
of
youth
;
he
had
profited
in
his
studies
beyond
expectation
,
and
besides
that
sensibility
of
discernment
which
is
the
foundation
of
taste
,
and
in
consequence
of
which
he
distinguished
and
enjoyed
the
beauties
of
the
Classics
,
he
had
already
given
several
specimens
of
a
very
promising
poetic
talent
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
complexion
and
these
qualifications
,
no
wonder
that
our
hero
attracted
the
notice
and
affection
of
the
young
Delias
in
town
,
whose
hearts
had
just
begun
to
flutter
for
they
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
Inquiries
were
made
concerning
his
condition
;
and
no
sooner
were
his
expectations
known
,
than
he
was
invited
and
caressed
by
all
the
parents
,
while
their
daughters
vyed
with
each
other
in
treating
him
with
particular
complacency
.
<EOS>
He
inspired
love
and
emulation
wherever
he
appeared
;
envy
and
jealous
rage
followed
of
course
;
so
that
he
became
a
very
desirable
,
though
a
very
dangerous
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
His
moderation
was
not
equal
to
his
success
;
his
vanity
took
the
lead
of
his
passions
,
dissipating
his
attention
,
which
might
otherwise
have
fixed
him
to
one
object
;
and
he
was
possessed
with
the
rage
of
increasing
the
number
of
his
conquests
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
frequented
public
walks
,
concerts
and
assemblies
,
became
remarkably
rich
and
fashionable
in
his
cloaths
,
gave
entertainments
to
the
ladies
,
and
was
in
the
utmost
hazard
of
turning
out
a
most
egregious
coxcomb
.
    
<EOS>
While
his
character
thus
wavered
between
the
ridicule
of
some
,
and
the
regard
of
others
,
an
accident
happened
,
which
,
by
contracting
his
view
to
one
object
,
detached
him
from
those
vain
pursuits
that
would
in
time
have
plunged
him
into
an
abyss
of
folly
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
Being
one
evening
at
the
ball
which
is
always
given
to
the
ladies
at
the
time
of
the
races
,
the
person
who
acted
as
master
of
the
ceremonies
,
knowing
how
fond
Mr
Pickle
was
of
every
opportunity
to
display
himself
,
came
up
and
told
him
,
that
there
was
a
fine
young
creature
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
who
seemed
to
have
a
great
inclination
to
dance
a
minuet
,
but
wanted
a
partner
,
the
gentleman
who
attended
her
being
in
boots
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
vanity
being
arroused
at
this
intimation
,
he
went
up
to
reconnoitre
the
young
lady
,
and
was
struck
with
admiration
at
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
be
of
his
own
age
,
was
tall
,
and
tho
'
slender
,
exquisitely
shaped
;
her
hair
was
auburn
,
and
in
such
plenty
,
that
the
barbarity
of
dress
had
not
been
able
to
prevent
it
from
shading
both
sides
of
her
forehead
,
which
was
high
and
polished
;
the
contour
of
her
face
was
oval
,
her
nose
very
little
raised
into
the
aquiline
form
,
that
contributed
to
the
spirit
and
dignity
of
her
aspect
;
her
mouth
was
small
,
her
lips
plump
,
juicy
and
delicious
,
her
teeth
regular
and
white
as
driven
snow
,
her
complexion
incredibly
delicate
and
glowing
with
health
,
and
her
full
blue
eyes
beamed
forth
vivacity
and
love
:
her
mein
was
at
the
same
time
commanding
and
engaging
,
her
address
perfectly
genteel
,
and
her
whole
appearance
so
captivating
,
that
our
young
Adonis
looked
,
and
was
overcome
.
    
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
recollected
himself
from
his
astonishment
,
than
he
advanced
to
her
with
a
graceful
air
of
respect
,
and
begged
she
would
do
him
the
honour
to
walk
a
minuet
with
him
.
<EOS>
She
seemed
particularly
pleased
with
his
application
,
and
very
frankly
complied
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
This
pair
was
too
remarkable
to
escape
the
particular
notice
of
the
company
:
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
was
well
known
by
almost
every
body
in
the
room
,
but
his
partner
was
altogether
a
new
face
,
and
of
consequence
underwent
the
criticism
of
all
the
ladies
in
the
assembly
;
one
whispered
,
"
She
has
a
good
complexion
,
but
do
n't
you
think
she
is
a
little
awry
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
A
second
pitied
her
for
her
masculine
nose
;
a
third
observed
,
that
she
was
aukward
for
want
of
seeing
company
;
a
fourth
distinguished
something
very
bold
in
her
countenance
;
and
in
short
,
there
was
not
a
beauty
in
her
whole
composition
,
which
the
glass
of
envy
did
not
pervert
into
a
blemish
.
    
<EOS>
The
men
,
however
,
looked
upon
her
with
different
eyes
;
among
them
her
appearance
produced
an
universal
murmur
of
applause
;
they
encircled
the
space
on
which
she
danced
,
and
were
enchanted
by
her
graceful
motion
.
<EOS>
While
they
launched
out
in
the
praise
of
her
,
they
expressed
their
displeasure
at
the
good
fortune
of
her
partner
,
whom
they
damned
for
a
little
finical
coxcomb
,
that
was
too
much
engrossed
by
the
contemplation
of
his
own
person
,
to
discern
or
deserve
the
favour
of
his
fate
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
hear
,
therefore
could
not
repine
at
these
invectives
;
but
while
they
imagined
he
indulged
his
vanity
,
a
much
more
generous
passion
had
taken
possession
of
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
petulance
of
gaiety
for
which
he
had
been
distinguished
in
his
public
appearance
,
he
now
gave
manifest
signs
of
confusion
and
concern
;
he
danced
with
an
anxiety
which
impeded
his
performance
,
and
blushed
to
the
eyes
at
every
false
step
he
made
.
<EOS>
Though
this
extraordinary
agitation
was
overlooked
by
the
men
,
it
could
not
escape
the
observation
of
the
ladies
,
who
perceived
it
with
equal
surprize
and
resentment
;
and
when
Peregrine
led
this
fair
unknown
to
her
seat
,
expressed
their
pique
in
an
affected
titter
,
which
broke
from
every
mouth
at
the
same
instant
,
as
if
all
of
them
had
been
informed
by
the
same
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
nettled
at
this
unmannerly
mark
of
disapprobation
,
and
,
in
order
to
increase
their
chagrin
,
endeavoured
to
enter
into
particular
conversation
with
their
fair
rival
.
<EOS>
The
young
lady
herself
,
who
neither
wanted
penetration
,
nor
the
consciousness
of
her
own
accomplishments
,
resented
their
behaviour
,
though
she
triumphed
at
the
cause
of
it
,
and
gave
her
partner
all
the
encouragement
he
could
desire
.
<EOS>
Her
mother
,
who
was
present
,
thanked
him
for
his
civility
in
taking
such
notice
of
a
stranger
,
and
he
received
a
compliment
of
the
same
nature
from
the
young
gentleman
in
boots
,
who
was
her
own
brother
.
    
<EOS>
If
he
was
charmed
with
her
appearance
,
he
was
quite
ravished
with
her
discourse
,
which
was
sensible
,
spirited
and
gay
.
    
<EOS>
Her
frank
and
sprightly
demeanour
excited
his
own
confidence
and
good
humour
;
and
he
described
to
her
the
characters
of
those
females
who
had
honoured
them
with
such
a
spiteful
mark
of
distinction
,
in
terms
so
replete
with
humorous
satire
,
that
she
seemed
to
listen
with
particular
complacency
of
attention
,
and
distinguished
every
nymph
thus
ridiculed
with
such
a
significant
glance
,
as
overwhelmed
her
with
chagrin
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
they
seemed
to
relish
each
other
's
conversation
,
during
which
our
young
Damon
acquitted
himself
with
great
skill
in
all
the
duties
of
gallantry
;
he
laid
hold
of
proper
opportunities
to
express
his
admiration
of
her
charms
,
had
recourse
to
the
silent
rhetoric
of
tender
looks
,
breathed
divers
insidious
sighs
,
and
attached
himself
wholly
to
her
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
company
broke
up
,
he
attended
her
to
her
lodgings
,
and
took
leave
of
her
with
a
squeeze
of
the
hand
,
after
having
obtained
permission
to
visit
her
next
morning
,
and
been
informed
by
the
mother
that
her
name
was
Miss
Emilia
Gauntlet
.
    
<EOS>
All
night
long
he
closed
not
an
eye
,
but
amused
himself
with
plans
of
pleasure
,
which
his
imagination
suggested
,
in
consequence
of
this
new
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
arose
with
the
lark
,
adjusted
his
air
into
an
agreeable
negligence
of
curl
,
and
dressing
himself
in
a
genteel
grey
frock
trimmed
with
silver
binding
,
waited
with
the
utmost
impatience
for
the
hour
of
ten
,
which
no
sooner
struck
,
than
he
hied
him
to
the
place
of
appointment
,
and
inquiring
for
Miss
Gauntlet
,
was
shewn
into
a
parlour
.
<EOS>
Here
he
had
not
waited
above
ten
minutes
,
when
Emilia
entered
in
a
most
inchanting
undress
,
with
all
the
graces
of
nature
playing
about
her
person
,
and
in
a
moment
rivetted
the
chains
of
his
slavery
beyond
the
power
of
accident
to
unbind
.
    
<EOS>
Her
mother
being
still
abed
,
and
her
brother
gone
to
give
orders
about
the
chaise
,
in
which
they
proposed
to
return
that
same
day
to
their
own
habitation
,
he
enjoyed
her
company
<EOS>
tte
a
tte
a
whole
hour
,
during
which
he
declared
his
love
in
the
most
passionate
terms
,
and
begged
that
he
might
be
admitted
into
the
number
of
those
admirers
whom
she
permitted
to
visit
and
adore
her
.
    
<EOS>
She
affected
to
look
upon
his
vows
and
protestations
as
the
ordinary
effects
of
gallantry
,
and
very
obligingly
assured
him
,
that
were
she
to
live
in
that
place
,
she
should
be
glad
to
see
him
often
;
but
as
the
spot
on
which
she
resided
was
at
a
considerable
distance
,
she
could
not
expect
he
would
go
so
far
upon
such
a
trifling
occasion
,
or
take
the
trouble
of
providing
himself
with
her
mamma
's
permission
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
favourable
hint
he
answered
with
all
the
eagerness
of
the
most
fervid
passion
,
that
he
had
uttered
nothing
but
the
genuine
dictates
of
his
heart
,
and
desired
nothing
so
much
as
an
opportunity
of
evincing
the
sincerity
of
his
professions
;
and
that
though
she
lived
at
the
extremity
of
the
kingdom
,
he
would
find
means
to
lay
himself
at
her
feet
,
provided
he
could
visit
her
with
her
mother
's
consent
,
which
he
assured
her
he
would
not
fail
to
sollicit
.
    
<EOS>
She
then
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
her
habitation
was
about
sixteen
miles
from
Winchester
,
in
a
village
which
she
named
,
and
where
(
as
he
could
easily
collect
from
her
discourse
)
<EOS>
he
would
be
no
unwelcome
guest
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
communication
they
were
joined
by
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
who
received
him
with
great
courtesy
,
thanked
him
again
for
his
politeness
to
Emy
at
the
Ball
,
and
anticipated
his
intention
,
by
saying
that
she
should
be
very
glad
to
see
him
at
her
house
,
if
ever
his
occasions
should
call
him
that
way
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXI
He
inquires
into
the
situation
of
this
young
lady
with
whom
he
is
enamoured
;
elopes
from
school
;
is
found
by
the
lieutenant
,
reconveyed
to
Winchester
,
and
sends
a
letter
with
a
copy
of
verses
to
his
mistress
.
   
<EOS>
He
was
transported
with
pleasure
at
this
invitation
,
which
he
assured
her
he
should
not
neglect
;
and
after
a
little
more
conversation
on
general
topics
,
took
his
leave
of
the
charming
Emilia
and
her
prudent
mamma
,
who
had
perceived
the
first
emotions
of
Mr
Pickle
's
passion
for
her
daughter
,
and
been
at
some
pains
to
inquire
about
his
family
and
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Neither
was
Peregrine
less
inquisitive
about
the
situation
and
pedigree
of
his
new
mistress
,
who
,
he
learned
,
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
field
-
officer
,
who
died
before
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
make
suitable
provision
for
his
children
;
that
the
widow
lived
in
a
frugal
,
though
decent
manner
,
on
the
pension
,
assisted
by
the
bounty
of
her
relations
;
that
the
son
carried
arms
as
volunteer
in
the
company
which
his
father
had
commanded
;
and
that
Emilia
had
been
educated
in
London
,
at
the
expence
of
a
rich
uncle
,
who
was
seized
with
the
whim
of
marrying
at
the
age
of
fifty
-
five
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
his
niece
had
returned
to
her
mother
,
without
any
visible
dependance
,
except
on
her
own
conduct
and
qualifications
.
    
<EOS>
This
account
,
though
it
could
not
diminish
his
affection
,
nevertheless
alarmed
his
pride
;
for
his
warm
imagination
had
exaggerated
all
his
own
prospects
;
and
he
began
to
fear
,
that
his
passion
for
Emilia
might
be
thought
to
derogate
from
the
dignity
of
his
situation
.
<EOS>
The
struggle
between
his
interest
and
love
produced
a
perplexity
which
had
an
evident
effect
upon
his
behaviour
;
he
became
pensive
,
solitary
and
peevish
,
avoided
all
publick
diversions
,
and
grew
so
remarkably
negligent
in
his
dress
,
that
he
was
scarce
distinguishable
by
his
own
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
This
contention
of
thoughts
continued
several
weeks
,
at
the
end
of
which
the
charms
of
Emilia
triumphed
over
every
other
consideration
;
and
having
received
a
supply
of
money
from
the
commodore
,
who
acted
towards
him
with
great
generosity
,
he
ordered
Pipes
to
put
up
some
linnen
,
and
other
necessaries
,
in
a
sort
of
knapsack
which
he
could
conveniently
carry
,
and
thus
attended
set
out
early
one
morning
on
foot
for
the
village
where
his
charmer
lived
,
at
which
he
arrived
before
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
having
chosen
this
method
of
travelling
,
that
his
rout
might
not
be
so
easily
discovered
,
as
it
must
have
been
,
had
he
hired
horses
,
or
taken
a
place
in
the
stage
-
coach
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
thing
he
did
was
to
secure
a
convenient
lodging
at
the
inn
where
he
dined
;
then
he
shifted
himself
,
and
according
to
the
direction
he
had
received
,
went
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
in
a
transport
of
joyous
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
As
he
approached
the
gate
his
agitation
increased
,
he
knocked
with
impatience
and
concern
,
the
door
opened
,
and
he
had
actually
asked
if
Mrs
Gauntlet
was
at
home
,
before
he
perceived
that
the
portress
was
no
other
than
his
dear
Emilia
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
without
emotion
at
the
unexpected
sight
of
her
lover
,
who
instantly
recognizing
his
charmer
,
obeyed
the
irresistible
impulse
of
his
love
,
and
caught
the
fair
creature
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
she
seem
offended
at
this
forwardness
of
bahaviour
,
which
might
have
displeased
another
of
a
less
open
disposition
,
or
less
used
to
the
freedom
of
a
sensible
education
;
but
her
natural
frankness
had
been
encouraged
and
improved
by
the
easy
and
familiar
intercourse
in
which
she
had
been
bred
;
and
therefore
,
instead
of
reprimanding
him
with
a
severity
of
look
,
she
with
great
good
humour
rallied
him
upon
his
assurance
,
which
,
she
observed
,
was
undoubtedly
the
effect
of
his
own
conscious
merit
,
and
conducted
him
into
a
parlour
,
where
he
found
her
mother
,
who
in
very
polite
terms
expressed
her
satisfaction
at
seeing
him
within
her
house
.
    
<EOS>
Having
drank
tea
together
,
Miss
Emy
proposed
an
evening
walk
,
which
they
enjoyed
through
a
variety
of
little
copses
and
lawns
,
watered
by
a
most
romantic
stream
,
that
quite
enchanted
the
imagination
of
Peregrine
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
late
before
they
returned
from
this
agreeable
excursion
,
and
when
our
lover
wished
the
ladies
good
night
,
Mrs
Gauntlet
insisted
upon
his
staying
to
supper
,
and
treated
him
with
particular
demonstrations
of
regard
and
affection
.
<EOS>
As
her
oeconomy
was
not
encumbered
with
an
unnecessary
number
of
domestics
,
her
own
presence
was
often
required
in
different
parts
of
the
house
,
so
that
the
young
gentleman
was
supplied
with
frequent
opportunities
of
promoting
his
suit
,
by
all
the
tender
oaths
and
insinuations
that
his
passion
could
suggest
.
    
<EOS>
He
protested
,
that
her
idea
had
taken
such
entire
possession
of
his
heart
,
that
finding
himself
unable
to
support
her
absence
one
day
longer
,
he
had
quitted
his
studies
,
and
left
his
governor
by
stealth
,
that
he
might
visit
the
object
of
his
adoration
,
and
be
blessed
in
her
company
for
a
few
days
without
interruption
.
    
<EOS>
She
listened
to
his
addresses
with
such
affability
as
denoted
approbation
and
delight
,
and
gently
chid
him
as
a
thoughtless
truant
,
but
carefully
avoided
the
confession
of
a
mutual
flame
;
because
she
discerned
,
in
the
midst
of
all
his
tenderness
,
a
levity
of
pride
which
she
durst
not
venture
to
trust
with
such
a
declaration
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
she
was
confirmed
in
this
caution
by
her
mother
,
who
very
wisely
,
in
her
civilities
to
him
,
maintained
a
sort
of
ceremonious
distance
,
which
she
thought
not
only
requisite
for
the
honour
and
interest
of
her
family
,
but
likewise
for
her
own
exculpation
,
should
she
ever
be
taxed
with
having
encouraged
or
abetted
him
in
the
imprudent
sallies
of
his
youth
:
<EOS>
Yet
notwithstanding
this
affected
reserve
,
he
was
treated
with
such
distinction
both
by
one
and
t'other
,
that
he
was
ravished
with
his
situation
,
and
became
more
and
more
enamoured
every
day
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
remained
under
the
influence
of
this
sweet
intoxication
,
his
absence
produced
great
disturbance
at
Winchester
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
was
grievously
afflicted
at
his
abrupt
departure
,
which
alarmed
him
the
more
,
as
it
happened
after
a
long
fit
of
melancholy
which
he
had
perceived
in
his
pupil
.
    
<EOS>
He
communicated
his
apprehensions
to
the
master
of
the
school
,
who
advised
him
to
apprize
the
commodore
of
his
nephew
's
disappearance
,
and
in
the
mean
time
inquire
at
all
the
inns
in
town
,
whether
he
had
hired
horses
,
or
any
sort
of
carriage
,
for
his
conveyance
,
or
was
not
met
with
on
the
road
by
any
person
who
could
give
an
account
of
the
direction
in
which
he
travelled
.
    
<EOS>
This
scrutiny
,
though
performed
with
great
diligence
and
minuteness
,
was
altogether
ineffectual
;
they
could
obtain
no
intelligence
of
the
runaway
.
<EOS>
Mr
Trunnion
was
well
nigh
distracted
at
the
news
of
his
flight
;
he
raved
with
great
fury
at
the
imprudence
of
Peregrine
,
whom
in
his
first
transports
he
damned
as
an
ungrateful
deserter
;
then
he
cursed
Hatchway
and
Pipes
,
who
he
swore
had
foundered
the
lad
by
their
pernicious
counsels
;
and
,
lastly
,
transferred
his
execrations
upon
Jolter
,
because
he
had
not
kept
a
better
look
-
out
:
finally
,
he
made
an
apostrophe
to
that
son
of
a
bitch
the
gout
,
which
for
the
present
disabled
him
from
searching
for
his
nephew
in
person
.
<EOS>
That
he
might
not
,
however
,
neglect
any
means
in
his
power
,
he
immediately
dispatched
expresses
to
all
the
sea
-
port
towns
on
that
coast
,
that
he
might
be
prevented
from
leaving
the
kingdom
;
and
the
lieutenant
,
at
his
own
desire
,
was
sent
across
the
country
,
in
quest
of
this
young
fugitive
.
    
<EOS>
Four
days
had
he
unsuccessfully
carried
on
his
inquiries
with
great
accuracy
,
when
resolving
to
return
by
Winchester
,
where
he
hoped
to
meet
with
some
hints
of
intelligence
,
by
which
he
might
profit
in
his
future
search
,
he
struck
off
the
common
road
,
to
take
the
benefit
of
a
nearer
cut
;
and
finding
himself
benighted
near
a
village
,
took
up
his
lodging
at
the
first
inn
to
which
his
horse
directed
him
.
    
<EOS>
Having
bespoke
something
for
supper
,
and
retired
to
his
chamber
,
where
he
amused
himself
with
a
pipe
,
he
heard
a
confused
noise
of
rustic
jollity
,
which
being
all
of
a
sudden
interrupted
,
after
a
short
pause
his
ear
was
saluted
by
the
voice
of
Pipes
,
who
,
at
the
sollicitation
of
the
company
,
began
to
entertain
them
with
a
song
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
instantly
recognized
the
well
-
known
sound
,
in
which
indeed
he
could
not
possibly
be
mistaken
,
as
nothing
in
nature
bore
the
least
resemblance
to
it
;
he
threw
his
pipe
into
the
chimney
,
and
snatching
up
one
of
his
pistols
,
ran
immediately
to
the
apartment
from
whence
the
voice
issued
:
he
no
sooner
entered
,
than
distinguishing
his
old
ship
-
mate
in
a
crowd
of
country
peasants
,
he
in
a
moment
sprung
upon
him
,
and
clapping
his
pistol
to
his
breast
,
exclaimed
,
"
<EOS>
Damn
you
,
Pipes
,
you
're
a
dead
man
,
if
you
do
n't
immediately
produce
young
master
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
menacing
application
had
a
much
greater
effect
upon
the
company
than
upon
Tom
,
who
looking
at
the
lieutenant
with
great
tranquillity
,
replied
,
"
Why
so
I
can
,
Master
Hatchway
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
safe
and
sound
?
<EOS>
"
cried
the
other
.
"
<EOS>
As
a
roach
,
"
answered
Pipes
,
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
friend
Jack
,
that
he
shook
him
by
the
hand
,
and
desired
him
to
proceed
with
his
song
.
<EOS>
This
being
performed
,
and
the
reckoning
discharged
,
the
two
friends
adjourned
to
the
other
room
,
where
the
lieutenant
was
informed
of
the
manner
in
which
the
young
gentleman
had
made
his
elopement
from
college
,
as
well
as
of
the
other
particulars
of
his
present
situation
,
as
far
as
they
had
fallen
within
the
sphere
of
his
comprehension
.
    
<EOS>
While
they
sat
thus
conferring
together
,
Peregrine
having
taken
his
leave
of
his
mistress
for
the
night
,
came
home
,
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
,
when
Hatchway
entering
his
chamber
in
his
sea
attitude
,
thrust
out
his
hand
by
way
of
salutation
.
<EOS>
His
old
pupil
received
him
as
usual
,
with
great
cordiality
,
and
expressed
his
astonishment
at
meeting
him
in
that
place
;
but
when
he
understood
the
cause
and
intention
of
his
arrival
,
he
started
with
concern
;
and
his
visage
glowing
with
indignation
,
told
him
he
was
old
enough
to
be
judge
of
his
own
conduct
,
and
when
he
should
see
it
convenient
,
would
return
of
himself
;
but
those
who
thought
he
was
to
be
compelled
to
his
duty
,
would
find
themselves
egregiously
mistaken
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
assured
him
,
that
for
his
own
part
he
had
no
intention
to
offer
him
the
least
violence
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
represented
to
him
the
danger
of
incensing
the
commodore
,
who
was
already
almost
distracted
on
account
of
his
absence
:
and
in
short
,
conveyed
his
arguments
,
which
were
equally
obvious
and
valid
,
in
such
expressions
of
friendship
and
respect
,
that
Peregrine
yielded
to
his
remonstrances
,
and
promised
to
accompany
him
next
day
to
Winchester
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
overjoyed
at
the
success
of
his
negociation
,
went
immediately
to
the
hostler
and
bespoke
a
post
-
chaise
for
Mr
Pickle
and
his
man
,
with
whom
he
afterwards
indulged
himself
in
a
double
cann
of
rumbo
,
and
when
the
night
was
pretty
far
advanced
,
left
the
lover
to
his
repose
,
or
rather
to
the
thorns
of
his
own
meditation
;
for
he
slept
not
one
moment
,
being
incessantly
tortured
with
the
prospect
of
parting
from
his
divine
Emilia
,
who
had
now
acquired
the
most
absolute
empire
over
his
soul
.
    
<EOS>
One
minute
he
proposed
to
depart
early
in
the
morning
,
without
seeing
this
enchantress
,
in
whose
bewitching
presence
he
durst
not
trust
his
own
resolution
.
<EOS>
Then
the
thoughts
of
leaving
her
in
such
an
abrupt
and
disrespectful
manner
,
interposed
in
favour
of
his
love
and
honour
.
<EOS>
This
war
of
sentiments
kept
him
all
night
upon
the
rack
,
and
it
was
time
to
rise
before
he
had
determined
to
visit
his
charmer
,
and
candidly
impart
the
motives
that
induced
him
to
leave
her
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
repaired
to
her
mother
's
house
with
a
heavy
heart
,
being
attended
to
the
gate
by
Hatchway
,
who
did
not
choose
to
leave
him
alone
;
and
being
admitted
,
found
Emilia
just
risen
,
and
in
his
opinion
,
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
his
early
visit
,
and
the
gloom
that
overspread
his
countenance
,
she
stood
in
silent
expectation
of
hearing
some
melancholy
tidings
;
and
it
was
not
till
after
a
considerable
pause
,
that
he
collected
resolution
enough
to
tell
her
he
was
come
to
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
Though
she
strove
to
conceal
her
sorrow
,
nature
was
not
to
be
suppressed
;
every
feature
of
her
countenance
saddened
in
a
moment
,
and
it
was
not
without
the
utmost
difficulty
that
she
kept
her
lovely
eyes
from
overflowing
.
<EOS>
He
saw
the
situation
of
her
thoughts
,
and
in
order
to
alleviate
her
concern
,
assured
her
he
should
find
means
to
see
her
again
in
a
very
few
weeks
;
mean
while
he
communicated
his
reasons
for
departing
,
in
which
she
readily
acquiesced
;
and
having
mutually
consoled
each
other
,
their
transports
of
grief
subsided
,
and
before
Mrs
Gauntlet
came
down
stairs
they
were
in
a
condition
to
behave
with
great
decency
and
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
This
good
lady
expressed
her
concern
when
she
learnt
his
resolution
,
saying
,
she
hoped
his
occasions
and
inclinations
would
permit
him
to
favour
them
with
his
agreeable
company
another
time
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
who
began
to
be
uneasy
at
Peregrine
's
stay
,
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
being
introduced
by
his
friend
,
had
the
honour
of
breakfasting
with
the
ladies
;
on
which
occasion
his
heart
received
such
a
rude
shock
from
the
charms
of
Emilia
,
that
he
afterwards
made
a
merit
with
his
friend
of
having
constrained
himself
so
far
,
as
to
forbear
commencing
his
professed
rival
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
they
bad
adieu
to
their
kind
entertainers
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
setting
out
from
the
inn
,
arrived
about
two
o'clock
in
Winchester
,
where
Mr
Jolter
was
overwhelmed
with
joy
at
their
appearance
.
    
<EOS>
The
nature
of
this
adventure
being
unknown
to
all
except
those
who
could
be
depended
upon
,
every
body
who
inquired
about
the
cause
of
Peregrine
's
absence
,
was
told
that
he
had
been
with
a
relation
in
the
country
,
and
the
master
condescended
to
overlook
his
indiscretion
;
so
that
Hatchway
seeing
every
thing
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
his
friend
,
returned
to
the
garrison
,
and
gave
the
commodore
an
account
of
his
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
was
very
much
startled
when
he
heard
there
was
a
lady
in
the
case
,
and
very
emphatically
observed
,
that
a
man
had
better
be
sucked
into
the
gulph
of
Florida
than
once
get
into
the
indraught
of
woman
;
because
in
one
case
,
he
may
with
good
pilotage
bring
out
his
vessel
safe
between
the
Bahama
's
and
the
Indian
shore
;
but
in
the
other
there
is
no
outlet
at
all
,
and
it
is
in
vain
to
strive
against
the
current
;
so
that
of
course
he
must
be
embayed
,
and
run
chuck
upon
a
lee
-
shore
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
,
therefore
,
to
lay
the
state
of
the
case
before
Mr
Gamaliel
Pickle
,
and
concert
such
measures
with
him
as
should
be
thought
likeliest
to
detach
his
son
from
the
pursuit
of
an
idle
amour
,
which
could
not
fail
of
interfering
in
a
dangerous
manner
with
the
plan
of
his
education
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Perry
's
ideas
were
totally
engrossed
by
his
amiable
mistress
,
who
,
whether
he
slept
or
waked
,
was
still
present
in
his
imagination
,
which
produced
the
following
stanza
's
in
her
praise
.
    
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
*
Adieu
,
ye
streams
that
smoothly
flow
,
Ye
vernal
airs
that
softly
blow
,
Ye
plains
by
blooming
spring
array'd
,
Ye
birds
that
warble
thro
'
the
shade
.
    
<EOS>
II
Unhurt
from
you
my
soul
could
fly
,
Nor
drop
one
tear
,
nor
heave
one
sigh
,
But
forc'd
from
Celia
's
charms
to
part
,
All
joy
deserts
my
drooping
heart
.

<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
fairer
than
the
rosy
morn
,
When
flowers
the
dewy
fields
adorn
;
Unsullied
as
the
genial
ray
,
That
warms
the
balmy
breeze
of
May.

Thy
charms
divinely
bright
appear
,
And
add
new
splendor
to
the
year

Improve
the
day
with
fresh
delight
,
And
gild
with
joy
the
dreary
night
!
    
<EOS>
This
juvenile
production
was
inclosed
in
a
very
tender
billet
to
Emilia
,
and
committed
to
the
charge
of
Pipes
,
who
was
ordered
to
set
out
for
Mrs
Gauntlet
's
habitation
with
a
present
of
venison
,
and
a
compliment
to
the
ladies
;
and
directed
to
take
some
opportunity
of
delivering
the
letter
to
miss
,
without
the
knowledge
of
her
mamma
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXII
<EOS>
His
messenger
meets
with
a
misfortune
,
to
which
he
applies
a
very
extraordinary
expedient
that
is
attended
with
strange
consequences
.
   
<EOS>
As
a
stage
coach
passed
within
two
miles
of
the
village
where
she
lived
,
Tom
bargained
with
the
driver
for
a
seat
on
the
box
,
and
accordingly
departed
on
this
message
,
though
he
was
but
indifferently
qualified
for
commissions
of
such
a
nature
:
having
received
particular
injunctions
about
the
letter
,
he
resolved
to
make
that
the
chief
object
of
his
care
,
and
very
sagaciously
conveyed
it
between
his
stocking
and
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
where
he
thought
it
would
be
perfectly
secure
from
all
injury
and
accident
.
<EOS>
Here
it
remained
until
he
arrived
at
the
inn
where
he
had
formerly
lodged
,
when
after
having
refreshed
himself
with
a
draught
of
beer
,
he
pulled
off
his
stocking
,
and
found
the
poor
billet
sullied
with
dust
,
and
torn
into
a
thousand
tatters
by
the
motion
of
his
foot
in
walking
the
last
two
miles
of
his
journey
.
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
this
phaenomenon
,
he
uttered
a
long
and
loud
whew
!
<EOS>
which
was
succeeded
by
an
exclamation
of
"
Damn
my
old
shoes
!
<EOS>
a
bite
by
G
#
#
#
#
!
"
<EOS>
then
he
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
and
his
forehead
upon
his
two
fists
,
and
in
that
attitude
deliberated
with
himself
upon
the
means
of
remedying
this
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
As
he
was
not
distracted
by
a
vast
number
of
ideas
,
he
soon
concluded
that
his
best
expedient
would
be
to
employ
the
clerk
of
the
parish
,
who
he
knew
was
a
great
scholar
,
to
write
another
epistle
according
to
the
directions
he
should
give
him
;
and
never
dreaming
that
the
mangled
original
would
in
the
least
facilitate
this
scheme
,
he
very
wisely
committed
it
to
the
flames
,
that
it
might
never
rise
up
in
judgment
against
him
.
    
<EOS>
Having
taken
this
wise
step
,
he
went
in
quest
of
his
scribe
,
to
whom
he
communicated
his
business
,
and
promised
a
full
-
pot
by
way
of
gratification
.
<EOS>
The
clerk
,
who
was
also
school
-
master
,
proud
of
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
his
talents
,
readily
undertook
the
task
;
and
repairing
with
his
employer
to
the
inn
,
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
<EOS>
produced
a
morsel
of
eloquence
so
much
to
the
satisfaction
of
Pipes
,
that
he
squeezed
his
hand
by
way
of
acknowledgment
,
and
doubled
his
allowance
of
beer
,
which
being
discussed
,
our
courier
betook
himself
to
the
house
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
with
the
haunch
of
venison
and
this
succedaneous
letter
,
and
delivered
his
message
to
the
mother
,
who
received
it
with
great
respect
,
and
many
kind
inquiries
about
the
health
and
welfare
of
his
master
,
attempting
to
tip
the
messenger
a
crown
,
which
he
absolutely
refused
to
accept
,
in
consequence
of
Mr
Pickle
's
repeated
caution
.
    
<EOS>
While
the
old
gentlewoman
turned
to
a
servant
,
in
order
to
give
directions
about
the
disposal
of
this
present
,
Pipes
looked
upon
this
as
a
favourable
occasion
to
transact
his
business
with
Emilia
,
and
therefore
,
shutting
one
eye
,
with
a
jirk
of
his
thumb
towards
his
left
shoulder
,
and
a
most
significant
twist
of
his
countenance
,
he
beckoned
the
young
lady
into
another
room
,
as
if
he
had
been
fraught
with
something
of
consequence
,
which
he
wanted
to
impart
.
<EOS>
She
understood
the
hint
howsoever
strangely
communicated
,
and
by
steping
to
one
side
of
the
room
,
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
slipping
the
epistle
into
her
hand
,
which
he
gently
squeezed
at
the
same
time
in
token
of
regard
;
then
throwing
a
side
-
glance
at
the
mother
,
whose
back
was
turned
,
clapped
his
finger
to
one
side
of
his
nose
,
thereby
recommending
secrecy
and
discretion
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
conveying
the
letter
into
her
bosom
,
could
not
help
smiling
at
Tom
's
politeness
and
dexterity
;
but
lest
her
mamma
should
detect
him
in
the
execution
of
his
pantomime
,
she
broke
off
this
intercourse
of
signs
,
by
asking
aloud
when
he
proposed
to
set
out
on
his
return
to
Winchester
;
and
when
he
answered
"
To
-
morrow
morning
,
"
Mrs
Gauntlet
recommended
him
to
the
hospitality
of
her
own
footman
,
desiring
him
to
make
much
of
Mr
Pipes
below
,
where
he
was
kept
to
supper
,
and
very
cordially
entertained
.
<EOS>
Our
young
heroine
,
impatient
to
read
her
lover
's
billet
,
which
made
her
heart
throb
with
rapturous
expectation
,
retired
to
her
chamber
as
soon
as
possible
,
with
a
view
of
perusing
the
contents
,
which
were
these
.
     
<EOS>
Divine
empress
of
my
soul
!
<EOS>
If
the
refulgent
flames
of
your
beauty
had
not
evaporated
the
particles
of
my
transported
brain
,
and
scorched
my
intellects
into
a
cinder
of
stolidity
,
perhaps
the
resplendency
of
my
passion
might
shine
illustrious
through
the
sable
curtain
of
my
ink
,
and
in
sublimity
transcend
the
galaxy
itself
,
though
wasted
on
the
pinions
of
a
grey
goose
quill
!
<EOS>
But
ah
!
celestial
enchantress
!
<EOS>
the
negromancy
of
thy
tyrannical
charms
hath
fettered
my
faculties
with
adamantine
chains
,
which
unless
thy
compassion
shall
melt
,
I
must
eternally
remain
in
the
tartarean
gulph
of
dismal
despair
.
<EOS>
Vouchsafe
therefore
,
O
thou
brightest
luminary
of
this
terrestrial
sphere
!
<EOS>
to
warm
as
well
as
shine
;
and
let
the
genial
rays
of
thy
benevolence
melt
the
icy
emanations
of
thy
disdain
,
which
hath
frozen
up
the
spirits
of
,
angelic
preheminence
!
<EOS>
thy
most
egregious
admirer
and
superlative
slave
 
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
Never
was
astonishment
more
perplexing
than
that
of
Emilia
,
when
she
read
this
curious
composition
,
which
she
repeated
verbatim
three
times
before
she
would
credit
the
evidence
of
her
own
senses
.
<EOS>
She
began
to
fear
in
good
earnest
that
love
had
produced
a
disorder
in
her
lover
's
understanding
;
but
after
a
thousand
conjectures
by
which
she
attempted
to
account
for
this
extraordinary
fustian
of
stile
,
she
concluded
that
it
was
the
effect
of
mere
levity
,
calculated
to
ridicule
the
passion
he
had
formerly
professed
.
<EOS>
Irritated
by
this
supposition
,
she
resolved
to
baulk
his
triumph
with
affected
indifference
,
and
in
the
mean
time
endeavour
to
expel
him
from
that
place
which
he
possessed
within
her
heart
.
    
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
such
a
victory
over
her
inclinations
might
have
been
obtained
without
great
difficulty
;
for
she
enjoyed
an
easiness
of
temper
that
could
accommodate
itself
to
the
emergencies
of
her
fate
;
and
her
vivacity
by
amusing
her
imagination
,
preserved
her
from
the
keener
sensations
of
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Thus
determined
and
disposed
,
she
did
not
send
any
sort
of
answer
,
or
the
least
token
of
remembrance
by
Pipes
,
who
was
suffered
to
depart
with
a
general
compliment
from
the
mother
,
and
arrived
at
Winchester
the
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
eyes
sparkled
when
he
saw
his
messenger
come
in
,
and
he
stretched
out
his
hand
in
full
confidence
of
receiving
some
particular
mark
of
his
Emilia
's
affection
;
but
how
was
he
confounded
,
when
he
felt
his
hope
so
cruelly
disappointed
!
<EOS>
In
an
instant
his
countenance
fell
.
<EOS>
He
stood
for
some
time
silent
and
abashed
,
then
thrice
repeated
the
interrogation
of
"
What
!
<EOS>
not
one
word
from
Emilia
?
"
<EOS>
And
dubious
of
his
courier
's
discretion
,
inquired
minutely
into
all
the
particulars
of
his
reception
.
<EOS>
He
asked
if
he
had
seen
the
young
lady
,
if
she
was
in
good
health
,
if
he
had
found
an
opportunity
of
delivering
his
letter
,
and
how
she
looked
when
he
put
it
into
her
hand
?
<EOS>
Pipes
answered
,
that
he
had
never
seen
her
in
better
health
or
higher
spirits
;
that
he
had
managed
matters
so
as
not
only
to
present
the
billet
unperceived
,
but
also
to
ask
her
commands
in
private
before
he
took
his
leave
,
when
she
told
him
that
the
letter
required
no
reply
.
<EOS>
This
last
circumstance
he
considered
as
a
manifest
mark
of
disrespect
,
and
gnawed
his
lips
with
resentment
.
<EOS>
Upon
further
reflexion
,
however
,
he
supposed
that
she
could
not
conveniently
write
by
the
messenger
,
and
would
undoubtedly
favour
him
by
the
post
.
    
<EOS>
This
consideration
consoled
him
for
the
present
,
and
he
waited
impatiently
for
the
fruits
of
his
hope
;
but
after
he
had
seen
eight
days
elapsed
without
reaping
the
satisfaction
with
which
he
had
flattered
himself
,
his
temper
forsook
him
<EOS>
,
he
raved
against
the
whole
sex
,
and
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
sullen
chagrin
;
but
his
pride
in
a
little
time
came
to
his
assistance
,
and
rescued
him
from
the
horrors
of
the
melancholy
fiend
.
<EOS>
He
resolved
to
retort
her
own
neglect
upon
his
ungrateful
mistress
,
his
countenance
gradually
resumed
its
former
serenity
;
and
though
by
this
time
he
was
pretty
well
cured
of
his
foppery
,
he
appeared
again
at
public
diversions
with
an
air
of
gaiety
and
unconcern
,
that
Emilia
might
have
a
chance
of
hearing
how
much
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
disregarded
her
disdain
.
    
<EOS>
There
are
never
wanting
certain
officious
persons
,
who
take
pleasure
in
promoting
intelligence
of
this
sort
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
soon
reached
the
ears
of
Miss
Gauntlet
,
and
confirmed
her
in
the
opinion
she
had
conceived
from
his
letter
;
so
that
she
fortified
herself
in
her
former
sentiments
,
and
bore
his
indifference
with
great
philosophy
.
<EOS>
Thus
a
correspondence
which
had
commenced
with
all
the
tenderness
and
sincerity
of
love
,
and
every
promise
of
duration
,
was
interrupted
in
its
infancy
by
a
misunderstanding
occasioned
by
the
simplicity
of
Pipes
,
who
never
once
reflected
upon
the
consequences
of
his
deceit
.
    
<EOS>
Though
their
mutual
passion
was
by
these
means
suppressed
for
the
present
,
it
was
not
altogether
extinguished
,
but
glowed
in
secret
,
though
even
to
themselves
unknown
,
until
an
occasion
which
afterwards
offered
,
blew
up
the
latent
flame
,
and
love
resumed
his
empire
in
their
breasts
.
    
<EOS>
While
they
moved
,
as
it
were
,
without
the
sphere
of
each
other
's
attraction
,
the
commodore
fearing
that
Perry
was
in
danger
of
involving
himself
in
some
pernicious
engagement
,
resolved
by
advice
of
Mr
Jolter
and
his
friend
the
parish
priest
,
to
recal
him
from
the
place
where
he
had
contracted
such
imprudent
connexions
,
and
send
him
to
the
university
,
where
his
education
might
be
compleated
,
and
his
fancy
weaned
from
all
puerile
amusements
.
    
<EOS>
This
plan
had
been
proposed
to
his
own
father
,
who
,
as
hath
been
already
observed
,
stood
always
neuter
in
every
thing
that
concerned
his
eldest
son
;
and
as
for
Mrs
Pickle
,
she
had
never
heard
his
name
mentioned
since
his
departure
with
any
degree
of
temper
or
tranquillity
,
except
when
her
husband
informed
her
that
he
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
ruined
by
this
indiscreet
amour
.
<EOS>
It
was
then
she
began
to
applaud
her
own
foresight
,
which
had
discerned
the
mark
of
reprobation
in
that
vicious
boy
,
and
launched
out
in
comparisons
between
him
and
Gammy
,
who
,
she
observed
,
was
a
child
of
uncommon
parts
and
solidity
,
and
with
the
blessing
of
God
,
would
be
a
comfort
to
his
parents
,
and
an
ornament
to
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
Should
I
affirm
that
this
favourite
whom
she
commended
so
much
,
was
in
every
respect
the
reverse
of
what
she
described
;
that
he
was
a
boy
of
mean
capacity
,
and
though
remarkably
distorted
in
his
body
,
much
more
crooked
in
his
disposition
;
and
that
she
had
persuaded
her
husband
to
espouse
her
opinion
,
though
it
was
contrary
to
common
sense
,
as
well
as
to
his
own
perception
;
I
am
afraid
the
reader
will
think
I
represent
a
monster
that
never
existed
in
nature
,
and
be
apt
to
condemn
the
oeconomy
of
my
invention
;
nevertheless
,
there
is
nothing
more
true
than
every
circumstance
of
what
I
have
advanced
;
and
I
wish
the
picture
,
singular
as
it
is
,
may
not
be
thought
to
resemble
more
than
one
original
.

Chapter
XXIII
Peregrine
is
summoned
to
attend
his
uncle
,
is
more
and
more
hated
by
his
own
mother
;
appeals
to
his
father
,
whose
condescension
is
defeated
by
the
dominion
of
his
wife
.
   
<EOS>
But
waving
these
reflections
,
let
us
return
to
Peregrine
,
who
received
a
summons
to
attend
his
uncle
,
and
in
a
few
days
arrived
with
Mr
Jolter
and
Pipes
at
the
garrison
,
which
he
filled
with
joy
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
alteration
,
which
,
during
his
absence
,
had
happened
in
his
person
,
was
very
favourable
to
his
appearance
,
which
from
that
of
a
comely
boy
,
was
converted
into
that
of
a
most
engaging
youth
.
<EOS>
He
was
already
taller
than
a
middle
-
sized
man
,
his
shape
ascertained
,
his
sinews
well
knit
,
his
mien
greatly
improved
,
and
his
whole
figure
as
elegant
and
graceful
,
as
if
it
had
been
cast
in
the
same
mould
with
the
Apollo
of
Belvidere
.
    
<EOS>
Such
an
outside
could
not
fail
of
prepossessing
people
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
notwithstanding
the
advantageous
reports
he
had
heard
,
found
his
expectation
exceeded
in
the
person
of
Peregrine
,
and
signified
his
approbation
in
the
most
sanguine
terms
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
was
struck
with
his
genteel
address
,
and
received
him
with
uncommon
marks
of
complacency
and
affection
;
he
was
caressed
by
all
the
people
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
,
while
they
admired
his
accomplishments
,
could
not
help
pitying
his
infatuated
mother
,
who
was
deprived
of
that
unutterable
delight
which
any
other
parent
would
have
enjoyed
in
the
contemplation
of
such
an
amiable
son
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
efforts
were
made
by
some
well
-
disposed
people
,
to
conquer
,
if
possible
,
this
monstrous
prejudice
;
but
their
endeavours
,
instead
of
curing
,
served
only
to
inflame
the
distemper
,
and
she
never
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
indulge
him
in
the
least
mark
of
maternal
regard
.
<EOS>
On
the
contrary
,
her
original
disgust
degenerated
into
such
inveteracy
of
hatred
,
that
she
left
no
stone
unturned
to
alienate
the
commodore
's
affection
for
this
her
innocent
child
,
and
even
practised
the
most
malicious
defamation
to
accomplish
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
Every
day
did
she
abuse
her
husband
's
ear
with
some
forged
instance
of
Peregrine
's
ingratitude
to
his
uncle
,
<EOS>
well
knowing
that
it
would
reach
the
commodore
's
knowledge
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
Mr
Pickle
used
to
tell
him
at
the
club
,
that
his
hopeful
favourite
had
ridiculed
him
in
such
a
company
,
and
aspersed
his
spouse
upon
another
occasion
;
and
thus
retail
the
little
scandalous
issue
of
his
own
wife
's
invention
.
<EOS>
Luckily
for
Peregrine
,
the
commodore
paid
no
great
regard
to
the
authority
of
his
informer
,
because
he
knew
from
what
canal
his
intelligence
flowed
;
besides
,
the
youth
had
a
staunch
friend
in
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
never
failed
to
vindicate
him
when
he
was
thus
unjustly
accused
,
and
always
found
argument
enough
to
confute
the
assertions
of
his
enemies
.
<EOS>
But
,
though
Trunnion
had
been
dubious
of
the
young
gentleman
's
principles
,
and
deaf
to
the
remonstrances
of
the
lieutenant
,
Perry
was
provided
with
a
bulwark
strong
enough
to
defend
him
from
all
such
assaults
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
no
other
than
his
aunt
,
whose
regard
for
him
was
perceived
to
increase
in
the
same
proportion
as
his
own
mother
's
diminished
;
and
indeed
,
the
augmentation
of
the
one
was
,
in
all
probability
,
owing
to
the
decrease
of
the
other
;
for
the
two
ladies
,
with
great
civility
,
performed
all
the
duties
of
good
neighbourhood
,
and
hated
each
other
most
piously
in
their
hearts
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Pickle
having
been
disobliged
at
the
splendor
of
her
sister
's
new
equipage
,
had
ever
since
that
time
,
in
the
course
of
her
visiting
,
endeavoured
to
make
people
merry
with
satirical
jokes
on
that
poor
lady
's
infirmities
;
and
Mrs
Trunnion
seized
the
very
first
opportunity
of
making
reprisals
,
by
inveighing
against
her
unnatural
behaviour
to
her
own
child
;
so
that
Peregrine
,
as
on
the
one
hand
he
was
abhorred
,
so
<EOS>
on
the
other
was
he
caressed
in
consequence
of
this
contention
;
and
I
firmly
believe
that
the
most
effectual
method
of
destroying
his
interest
at
the
garrison
,
would
have
been
the
shew
of
countenancing
him
at
his
father
's
house
:
but
,
whether
this
conjecture
be
reasonable
or
chimerical
,
certain
it
is
the
experiment
was
never
tried
,
and
therefore
Mr
Peregrine
ran
no
risk
of
being
disgraced
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
who
assumed
,
and
justly
too
,
the
whole
merit
of
his
education
,
was
now
as
proud
of
the
youth
's
improvements
,
as
if
he
had
actually
been
his
own
offspring
;
and
sometimes
his
affection
rose
to
such
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
that
he
verily
believed
him
to
be
the
issue
of
his
own
loins
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
favourable
predicament
in
which
our
hero
stood
with
his
aunt
and
her
husband
,
he
could
not
help
feeling
the
injury
he
suffered
from
the
caprice
of
his
mother
;
and
though
the
gaiety
of
his
disposition
hindered
him
from
afflicting
himself
with
reflexions
of
any
gloomy
cast
,
he
did
not
fail
to
forsee
that
if
any
sudden
accident
should
deprive
him
of
the
commodore
,
he
would
in
all
likelihood
find
himself
in
a
very
disagreeable
situation
.
<EOS>
Prompted
by
this
consideration
,
he
one
evening
accompanied
his
uncle
to
the
club
,
and
was
introduced
to
his
father
,
before
that
worthy
gentleman
had
the
least
inkling
of
his
arrival
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Gamaliel
was
never
so
disconcerted
as
at
this
rencounter
.
<EOS>
His
own
disposition
would
not
suffer
him
to
do
any
thing
that
might
create
the
least
disturbance
,
or
interrupt
his
evening
's
enjoyment
;
and
so
strongly
was
he
impressed
with
the
terror
of
his
wife
,
that
he
durst
not
yield
to
the
tranquillity
of
his
temper
:
and
,
as
I
have
already
observed
,
his
inclination
was
perfectly
neutral
.
<EOS>
Thus
distracted
between
different
motives
,
when
Perry
was
presented
to
him
,
he
sat
silent
and
absorpt
,
as
if
he
did
not
or
would
not
perceive
the
application
;
and
when
he
was
urged
to
declare
himself
by
the
youth
,
who
pathetically
begged
to
know
how
he
had
incurred
his
displeasure
,
he
answered
in
a
peevish
strain
,
"
Why
,
good
now
,
child
,
what
would
you
have
me
to
do
?
<EOS>
your
mother
ca
n't
abide
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
my
mother
is
so
unkind
,
I
will
not
call
it
unnatural
,
(
said
Peregrine
,
the
tears
of
indignation
starting
from
his
eyes
)
<EOS>
as
to
banish
me
from
her
presence
and
affection
,
without
the
least
cause
assigned
;
I
hope
you
will
not
be
so
unjust
as
to
espouse
her
barbarous
prejudice
.
"
<EOS>
Before
Mr
Pickle
had
time
to
reply
to
this
expostulation
,
for
which
he
was
not
at
all
prepared
,
the
commodore
interposed
,
and
enforced
his
favourite
's
remonstrance
,
by
telling
Mr
Gamaliel
that
he
was
ashamed
to
see
any
man
drive
in
such
a
miserable
manner
under
his
wife
's
petticoat
.
"
    
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
part
,
(
said
he
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
assuming
a
look
of
importance
and
command
)
before
I
would
suffer
myself
to
be
steered
all
weathers
by
any
woman
in
Christendom
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
I
'd
raise
such
a
hurricane
about
her
ears
that
"
 
Here
he
was
interrupted
by
Mr
Hatchway
,
who
thrusting
his
head
towards
the
door
,
in
the
attitude
of
one
that
listens
,
cried
"
Ahey
!
<EOS>
there
's
your
spouse
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
.
<EOS>
"
Trunnion
's
features
that
instant
adopted
a
new
disposition
:
fear
and
confusion
took
possession
of
his
countenance
;
his
voice
from
a
tone
of
vociferation
sunk
into
a
whisper
of
"
Sure
you
must
be
mistaken
,
Jack
;
"
and
in
great
perplexity
he
wiped
off
the
sweat
which
had
started
on
his
forehead
at
this
false
alarm
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
having
thus
punished
him
for
the
rhodomontade
he
had
uttered
,
told
him
with
an
arch
sneer
,
that
he
was
deceived
by
the
sound
of
the
outward
door
creaking
upon
its
hinges
,
which
he
mistook
for
Mrs
Trunnion
's
voice
,
and
desired
him
to
proceed
with
his
admonitions
to
Mr
Pickle
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
denied
that
this
arrogance
was
a
little
unseasonable
in
the
commodore
,
who
was
in
all
respects
as
effectually
subdued
to
the
dominion
of
his
wife
,
as
the
person
whose
submission
he
then
ventured
to
condemn
;
with
this
difference
of
disposition
:
Trunnion
's
subjection
was
like
that
of
a
bear
,
chequered
with
fits
of
surliness
and
rage
;
whereas
Pickle
bore
the
yoke
like
an
ox
,
without
repining
.
    
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
that
this
indolence
,
this
sluggishness
,
this
stagnation
of
temper
,
rendered
Gamaliel
incapable
of
withstanding
the
arguments
and
importunity
of
his
friends
,
to
which
he
at
length
surrendered
,
acquiesced
in
the
justice
of
their
observations
,
and
taking
his
son
by
the
hand
,
promised
to
favour
him
for
the
future
with
his
love
and
fatherly
protection
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
laudable
resolution
did
not
last
;
Mrs
Pickle
still
dubious
of
his
constancy
,
and
jealous
of
his
communication
with
the
commodore
,
never
failed
to
interrogate
him
every
night
about
the
conversation
that
happened
at
the
club
;
and
regulate
her
exhortations
according
to
the
intelligence
she
received
.
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
,
therefore
,
safely
conveyed
to
bed
,
(
that
academy
in
which
all
notable
wives
communicate
their
lectures
)
when
her
catechism
began
;
and
she
in
a
moment
perceived
something
reluctant
and
equivocal
in
her
husband
's
answers
.
<EOS>
Arroused
at
this
discovery
,
she
employed
her
influence
and
skill
with
such
success
,
that
he
disclosed
every
circumstance
of
what
had
happened
;
and
after
having
sustained
a
most
severe
rebuke
for
his
simplicity
and
indiscretion
,
humbled
himself
so
far
as
to
promise
that
he
would
next
day
annul
the
condescensions
he
had
made
,
and
for
ever
renounce
the
ungracious
object
of
her
disgust
.
<EOS>
This
undertaking
was
punctually
performed
in
a
letter
to
the
commodore
,
which
she
herself
dictated
in
these
words
.
     
<EOS>
Sir
,
Whereas
my
good
-
nature
being
last
night
imposed
upon
,
I
was
persuaded
to
countenance
and
promise
<EOS>
I
know
not
what
to
that
vicious
youth
,
whose
parent
I
have
the
misfortune
to
be
;
I
desire
you
will
take
notice
that
I
revoke
all
such
countenance
and
promises
,
and
shall
never
look
upon
that
man
as
my
friend
,
who
will
henceforth
in
such
a
cause
solicit
,
 
Sir
,
yours
,
&
c.
Gam
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXIV
Trunnion
is
enraged
at
the
conduct
of
Pickle
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
resents
the
injustice
of
his
mother
,
to
whom
he
explains
his
sentiments
in
a
letter
.
<EOS>
Is
entered
at
the
University
of
Oxford
,
where
he
signalizes
himself
as
a
youth
of
an
enterprising
genius
.
   
<EOS>
Unspeakable
were
the
transports
of
rage
to
which
Trunnion
was
incensed
by
this
absurd
renunciation
:
he
tore
the
letter
with
his
gums
,
(
<EOS>
teeth
he
had
none
)
<EOS>
spit
with
furious
grimaces
,
in
token
of
the
contempt
he
entertained
for
the
author
,
whom
he
not
only
damned
as
a
lousy
,
scabby
,
nasty
,
scurvy
,
sculking
,
lubberly
noodle
,
but
resolved
to
challenge
to
single
combat
with
fire
and
sword
;
but
he
was
dissuaded
from
this
violent
measure
,
and
appeased
by
the
intervention
and
advice
of
the
lieutenant
and
Mr
Jolter
,
who
represented
the
message
as
the
effect
of
the
poor
man
's
infirmity
,
for
which
he
was
rather
an
object
of
pity
than
of
resentment
;
and
turned
the
stream
of
his
indignation
against
the
wife
,
whom
he
reviled
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
Peregrine
himself
bear
with
patience
this
injurious
declaration
,
the
nature
of
which
he
no
sooner
understood
from
Hatchway
,
than
equally
shocked
and
exasperated
,
he
retired
to
his
apartment
,
and
in
the
first
emotions
of
his
ire
,
produced
the
following
epistle
,
which
was
immediately
conveyed
to
his
mother
.
     
<EOS>
Madam
,
Had
nature
formed
me
a
bugbear
to
the
fight
,
and
inspired
me
with
a
soul
as
vicious
as
my
body
was
detestable
,
perhaps
I
might
have
enjoyed
particular
marks
of
your
affection
and
applause
;
seeing
you
have
persecuted
me
with
such
unnatural
aversion
,
for
no
other
visible
reason
than
that
of
my
differing
so
widely
in
shape
as
well
as
disposition
,
from
that
deformed
urchin
who
is
the
object
of
your
tenderness
and
care
.
<EOS>
If
those
be
the
terms
on
which
alone
I
can
obtain
your
favour
,
I
pray
God
you
may
never
cease
to
hate
,
Madam
,
Your
most
injured
son
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
This
letter
,
which
nothing
but
his
passion
and
inexperience
could
excuse
,
had
such
an
effect
upon
his
mother
,
as
may
be
easily
conceived
.
<EOS>
She
was
enraged
to
a
degree
of
frenzy
against
the
writer
;
though
at
the
same
time
she
considered
the
whole
as
the
production
of
Mrs
Trunnion
's
particular
pique
,
and
represented
it
to
her
husband
as
an
insult
,
that
he
was
bound
in
honour
to
resent
,
by
breaking
off
all
correspondence
with
the
commodore
and
his
family
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
bitter
pill
to
Gamaliel
,
who
,
through
a
long
course
of
years
,
was
so
habituated
to
Trunnion
's
company
,
that
he
could
as
easily
have
parted
with
a
limb
,
as
have
relinquished
the
club
all
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
ventured
to
represent
his
own
incapacity
to
follow
her
advice
,
and
begged
that
he
might
at
least
be
allowed
to
drop
the
connexion
gradually
;
protesting
that
he
would
do
his
endeavour
to
give
her
all
manner
of
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
preparations
were
made
for
Peregrine
's
departure
to
the
university
,
and
in
a
few
weeks
he
set
out
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
his
age
,
accompanied
by
the
same
attendants
who
lived
with
him
at
Winchester
,
after
his
uncle
had
laid
strong
injunctions
upon
him
to
avoid
the
company
of
modest
women
,
to
mind
his
learning
,
to
let
him
hear
of
his
welfare
as
often
as
he
could
spare
time
to
write
,
and
had
settled
his
appointments
at
the
rate
of
five
hundred
a
year
,
including
his
governor
's
salary
,
which
was
one
fifth
part
of
the
sum
.
<EOS>
The
heart
of
our
young
gentleman
dilated
at
the
prospect
of
the
figure
he
should
make
with
such
an
handsome
annuity
,
the
management
of
which
was
left
to
his
own
discretion
;
and
he
amused
his
imagination
with
the
most
agreeable
reveries
during
his
journey
to
Oxford
,
which
he
performed
in
two
days
.
<EOS>
Here
being
introduced
to
the
head
of
the
college
,
to
whom
he
had
been
recommended
,
accommodated
with
genteel
apartments
,
entered
as
gentleman
commoner
in
the
books
,
and
provided
with
a
judicious
tutor
,
instead
of
returning
to
the
study
of
Greek
and
Latin
,
in
which
he
thought
himself
already
sufficiently
instructed
;
he
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
some
of
his
old
school
-
fellows
,
whom
he
found
in
the
same
situation
,
and
was
by
them
initiated
in
all
the
fashionable
diversions
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
he
made
himself
remarkable
for
his
spirit
and
humour
,
which
were
so
acceptable
to
the
bucks
of
the
university
,
that
he
was
admitted
as
a
member
of
their
corporation
,
and
in
a
very
little
time
became
the
most
conspicuous
personage
of
the
whole
fraternity
;
not
that
he
valued
himself
upon
his
ability
in
smoaking
the
greatest
number
of
pipes
,
and
drinking
the
largest
quantity
of
ale
;
these
were
qualifications
of
too
gross
a
nature
to
captivate
his
refined
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
piqued
himself
on
his
talent
for
raillery
,
his
genius
and
taste
,
his
personal
accomplishments
,
and
his
success
at
intrigue
;
nor
were
his
excursions
confined
to
the
small
villages
in
the
neighbourhood
,
which
are
commonly
visited
once
a
week
by
the
students
for
the
sake
of
carnal
recreation
.
<EOS>
He
kept
his
own
horses
,
traversed
the
whole
country
in
parties
of
pleasure
,
attended
all
the
races
within
fifty
miles
of
Oxford
,
and
made
frequent
jaunts
to
London
,
where
he
used
to
lie
incognito
during
the
best
part
of
many
a
term
.
    
<EOS>
The
rules
of
the
university
were
too
severe
to
be
observed
by
a
youth
of
his
vivacity
;
and
therefore
he
became
acquainted
with
the
proctor
,
by
times
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
checks
he
received
were
insufficient
to
moderate
his
career
;
he
frequented
taverns
and
coffee
-
houses
,
committed
midnight
frolics
in
the
streets
,
insulted
all
the
sober
and
pacific
class
of
his
fellow
-
students
;
the
tutors
themselves
were
not
sacred
from
his
ridicule
;
he
laughed
at
the
magistrate
,
and
neglected
every
particular
of
college
-
discipline
.
    
<EOS>
In
vain
did
they
attempt
to
restrain
his
irregularities
by
the
imposition
of
fines
;
he
was
liberal
to
profusion
,
and
therefore
paid
without
reluctance
.
    
<EOS>
Thrice
<EOS>
did
he
scale
the
windows
of
a
tradesman
,
with
whose
daughter
he
had
an
affair
of
gallantry
,
as
often
was
he
obliged
to
seek
his
safety
by
a
precipitate
leap
;
and
one
night
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
an
ambuscade
that
was
laid
by
the
father
,
had
not
his
trusty
squire
Pipes
interposed
in
his
behalf
,
and
manfully
rescued
him
from
the
clubs
of
his
enemies

<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
excesses
,
Mr
Jolter
finding
his
admonitions
neglected
,
and
his
influence
utterly
destroyed
,
attempted
to
wean
his
pupil
from
his
extravagant
courses
,
by
engaging
his
attention
in
some
more
laudable
pursuit
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
introduced
him
into
a
club
of
politicians
,
who
received
him
with
great
demonstrations
of
regard
,
accommodated
themselves
more
than
he
could
have
expected
to
his
jovial
disposition
,
and
while
they
revolved
schemes
for
the
reformation
of
the
state
,
drank
with
such
devotion
to
the
accomplishment
of
their
plans
,
that
before
parting
the
cares
of
their
patriotism
were
quite
overwhelmed
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
could
not
approve
of
their
doctrine
,
resolved
to
attach
himself
for
some
time
to
their
company
;
because
he
perceived
ample
subject
for
his
ridicule
,
in
the
characters
of
these
wrong
-
headed
enthusiasts
.
<EOS>
It
was
a
constant
practice
with
them
,
in
their
midnight
consistories
,
to
swallow
such
plentiful
draughts
of
inspiration
,
that
their
mysteries
commonly
ended
like
those
of
the
Bacchanalian
Orgia
;
and
they
were
seldom
capable
of
maintaining
that
solemnity
of
decorum
which
by
the
nature
of
their
functions
most
of
them
were
obliged
to
profess
.
<EOS>
Now
as
Peregrine
's
satirical
disposition
was
never
more
gratified
than
when
he
had
an
opportunity
of
exposing
grave
characters
in
ridiculous
attitudes
,
he
laid
a
mischievous
snare
for
his
new
confederates
,
which
took
effect
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
In
one
of
their
nocturnal
deliberations
,
he
promoted
such
a
spirit
of
good
fellowship
,
by
the
agreeable
sallies
of
his
wit
,
which
were
purposely
levelled
against
their
political
adversaries
,
that
by
ten
o'clock
they
were
all
ready
to
join
in
the
most
extravagant
proposal
that
could
be
made
.
<EOS>
They
had
already
broke
their
glasses
in
consequence
of
his
suggestion
,
drank
healths
out
of
their
shoes
,
caps
,
and
the
bottoms
of
the
candlesticks
that
stood
before
them
,
sometimes
standing
with
one
foot
on
a
chair
,
and
the
knee
bent
on
the
edge
of
the
table
;
and
when
they
could
no
longer
stand
in
that
posture
,
setting
their
bare
posteriors
on
the
cold
floor
,
they
huzza'd
,
hollowed
,
danced
and
sung
,
and
in
short
were
elevated
to
such
a
pitch
of
intoxication
,
that
when
Peregrine
proposed
that
they
should
burn
their
perriwigs
,
the
hint
was
immediately
approved
,
and
they
executed
the
frolick
as
one
man
;
their
shoes
and
caps
underwent
the
same
fate
by
the
same
instigation
,
and
in
this
trim
he
led
them
forth
into
the
street
,
where
they
resolved
to
compel
every
body
they
should
find
to
subscribe
to
their
political
creed
,
and
pronounce
the
Shiboleth
of
their
party
.
<EOS>
In
the
atchievement
of
this
enterprize
,
they
met
with
more
opposition
than
they
expected
;
they
were
encountered
with
arguments
which
they
could
not
well
withstand
;
the
noses
of
some
,
and
eyes
of
others
,
in
a
very
little
time
bore
the
marks
of
obstinate
disputation
;
and
their
conductor
having
at
length
engaged
the
whole
body
in
a
fray
with
another
squadron
which
was
pretty
much
in
the
same
condition
,
he
very
fairly
gave
them
the
slip
,
and
slyly
retreated
to
his
apartment
,
foreseeing
that
his
companions
would
soon
be
favoured
with
the
notice
of
their
superiors
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
deceived
in
his
prognostic
;
the
proctor
going
his
round
,
chanced
to
fall
in
with
this
tumultuous
uproar
,
and
interposing
his
authority
,
found
means
to
quiet
the
disturbance
,
and
,
after
having
taken
cognizance
of
their
names
,
dismissed
the
rioters
to
their
respective
chambers
,
not
a
little
scandalized
at
the
behaviour
of
some
among
them
,
whose
business
and
duty
it
was
to
set
far
other
examples
to
the
youth
under
their
care
and
direction
.
    
<EOS>
About
midnight
Pipes
,
who
had
orders
to
attend
at
a
distance
,
and
keep
an
eye
upon
Jolter
,
brought
home
that
unfortunate
governor
upon
his
back
<EOS>
(
Peregrine
having
beforehand
secured
his
admittance
into
the
college
)
and
among
other
bruises
,
he
was
found
to
have
received
a
couple
of
contusions
on
his
face
,
which
next
morning
appeared
in
a
black
circle
that
surrounded
each
eye
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
mortifying
circumstance
to
a
man
of
his
character
and
deportment
,
especially
as
he
had
received
a
message
from
the
proctor
,
who
desired
to
see
him
forthwith
.
<EOS>
With
great
humility
and
contrition
he
begged
the
advice
of
his
pupil
,
who
being
used
to
amuse
himself
with
painting
,
assured
Mr
Jolter
,
that
he
would
cover
those
signs
of
disgrace
with
a
slight
coat
of
flesh
-
colour
,
so
dextrously
,
that
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
distinguish
the
artificial
from
the
natural
skin
.
    
<EOS>
The
rueful
governor
,
rather
than
expose
such
opprobrious
tokens
to
the
observation
and
censure
of
the
magistrate
,
submitted
to
the
expedient
;
and
although
his
counsellor
had
over
-
rated
his
own
skill
,
was
persuaded
to
confide
in
the
disguise
,
and
actually
attended
the
proctor
,
with
such
a
staring
addition
to
the
natural
ghastliness
of
his
features
,
that
his
visage
bore
a
very
apt
resemblance
to
some
of
those
ferocious
countenances
that
hang
over
the
doors
of
certain
taverns
and
alehouses
,
under
the
denomination
of
the
Saracen
's
head
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
remarkable
alteration
of
phisiognomy
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
the
most
undiscerning
beholder
,
much
less
the
penetrating
eye
of
this
severe
judge
,
already
whetted
with
what
he
had
seen
over
-
night
.
<EOS>
He
was
therefore
upbraided
with
his
ridiculous
and
shallow
artifice
,
and
,
together
with
the
companions
of
his
debauch
,
underwent
such
a
cutting
reprimand
for
the
scandalous
irregularity
of
his
conduct
,
that
all
of
them
remained
crest
-
fallen
,
and
were
ashamed
,
for
many
weeks
,
to
appear
in
the
publick
execution
of
their
duty
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
too
vain
of
his
finesse
,
to
conceal
the
part
he
acted
in
this
comedy
,
with
the
particulars
of
which
he
regaled
his
companions
,
and
thereby
intailed
upon
himself
the
hate
and
resentment
of
the
community
,
whose
maxims
and
practices
he
had
disclosed
;
for
he
was
considered
as
a
spy
,
who
had
intruded
himself
into
their
society
with
a
view
of
betraying
it
;
or
,
at
best
,
an
apostate
and
renegado
from
the
faith
and
principles
which
he
had
professed
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXV
He
is
insulted
by
his
tutor
,
whom
he
lampoons
;
makes
considerable
progress
in
polite
literature
;
and
in
an
excursion
to
Windsor
meets
with
Emilia
by
accident
,
and
is
very
coldly
received
.
   
<EOS>
Among
those
who
suffered
by
his
craft
and
infidelity
was
Mr
Jumble
his
own
tutor
,
who
could
not
at
all
digest
the
mortifying
affront
he
had
received
,
and
was
resolved
to
be
revenged
on
the
insulting
author
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
watched
the
conduct
of
Mr
Pickle
with
the
utmost
rancour
of
vigilance
,
and
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
treating
him
with
disrespect
,
which
he
knew
the
disposition
of
his
pupil
could
less
brook
than
any
other
severity
it
was
in
his
power
to
exercise
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
had
been
several
mornings
absent
from
chapel
;
and
as
Mr
Jumble
never
failed
to
question
him
in
a
very
peremptory
stile
about
his
non
-
attendance
,
he
invented
some
very
plausible
excuses
;
but
,
at
length
,
his
ingenuity
was
exhausted
;
he
received
a
very
galling
rebuke
for
his
profligacy
of
morals
,
and
that
he
might
feel
it
the
more
sensibly
,
was
ordered
,
by
way
of
exercise
,
to
compose
a
paraphrase
in
English
verse
,
upon
these
two
lines
in
Virgil
,
Vane
ligur
,
frustraque
animis
elate
superbis
,
Necquicquam
,
patrias
,
tentasti
lubricus
,
artes
.
    
<EOS>
The
imposition
of
this
invidious
theme
had
all
the
desired
effect
upon
Peregrine
,
who
not
only
considered
it
as
a
piece
of
unmannerly
abuse
levelled
against
his
own
conduct
,
but
also
as
a
retrospective
insult
on
the
memory
of
his
grandfather
,
who
(
as
he
had
been
informed
)
was
in
his
life
-
time
more
noted
for
his
cunning
than
candour
in
trade
.
    
<EOS>
Exasperated
at
this
instance
of
the
pedant
's
audacity
,
he
had
well
nigh
(
in
his
first
transports
)
taken
corporal
satisfaction
on
the
spot
;
but
foreseeing
the
troublesome
consequences
that
would
attend
such
a
flagrant
outrage
against
the
laws
of
the
university
,
he
checked
his
indignation
,
and
resolved
to
revenge
the
injury
in
a
more
cool
and
contemptuous
manner
.
<EOS>
Thus
determined
,
he
set
on
foot
an
inquiry
into
the
particulars
of
Jumble
's
parentage
and
education
,
and
learnt
that
the
father
of
this
insolent
tutor
was
a
bricklayer
,
and
that
his
mother
sold
pies
,
and
that
the
son
,
at
different
periods
of
his
youth
,
had
amused
himself
in
both
occupations
,
before
he
converted
his
views
to
the
study
of
learning
.
<EOS>
Fraught
with
this
intelligence
,
he
composed
the
following
ballad
in
doggerel
rhymes
,
and
next
day
presented
it
as
a
gloss
upon
the
text
which
the
tutor
had
chosen
.
    
<EOS>
I
<EOS>
*
Come
,
listen
ye
students
of
ev'ry
degree
<EOS>
,
I
sing
of
a
wit
and
a
tutor
perdie
,
A
statesman
profound
,
a
critick
immense
,
<EOS>
In
short
,
a
meer
jumble
of
learning
and
sense
;
And
yet
of
his
talents
,
tho
'
laudably
vain
,
His
own
family
arts
he
could
never
attain
.
    
<EOS>
II
<EOS>
His
father
intending
his
fortune
to
build
,
In
his
youth
would
have
taught
him
the
trowel
to
wield
,
But
the
mortar
of
discipline
never
would
stick
,
For
his
skull
was
secur'd
by
a
facing
of
brick
,
And
with
all
his
endeavours
of
patience
and
pain
,
The
skill
of
his
fire
he
could
never
attain
.
    
<EOS>

<EOS>
His
mother
an
housewife
neat
,
artful
and
wise
<EOS>
,
Renown'd
for
her
delicate
biscuit
and
pies
,
Soon
alter'd
<EOS>
his
studies
,
by
flatt'ring
his
taste
,
From
the
raising
of
walls
to
the
rearing
of
paste
;
But
all
her
instructions
were
fruitless
and
vain
,
The
pye
-
making
myst'ry
he
ne'er
could
attain
.
    
<EOS>
IV
<EOS>
Yet
true
to
his
race
,
in
his
labours
was
seen
A
jumble
of
both
their
professions
,
<EOS>
I
ween
;
For
,
obliged
to
his
own
understanding
to
trust
,
His
pies
seem'd
of
brick
,
and
his
houses
of
crust
.
<EOS>
Then
,
good
Mr
Tutor
,
pray
be
not
so
vain
,
Since
your
family
arts
you
could
never
attain
.
    
<EOS>
This
impudent
production
was
the
most
effectual
vengeance
he
could
have
taken
on
his
tutor
,
who
had
all
the
supercilious
arrogance
and
ridiculous
pride
of
a
low
-
born
pedant
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
overlooking
this
petulant
piece
of
satire
with
that
temper
and
decency
of
disdain
that
became
a
person
of
his
gravity
and
station
,
he
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
over
the
performance
,
than
the
blood
rushed
into
his
countenance
,
which
immediately
after
exhibited
a
ghastly
pale
colour
,
and
with
a
quivering
lip
he
told
his
pupil
that
he
was
an
impertinent
jackanapes
,
and
he
would
take
care
that
he
should
be
expelled
from
the
university
,
for
having
presumed
to
write
and
deliver
such
a
licentious
and
scurrilous
libel
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
answered
with
great
resolution
,
that
when
the
provocation
he
had
received
should
be
known
,
he
was
persuaded
that
he
should
be
acquitted
by
the
opinion
of
all
impartial
people
;
and
that
he
was
ready
to
submit
the
whole
to
the
decision
of
the
master
.
    
<EOS>
This
arbitration
he
proposed
,
because
he
knew
the
master
and
Jumble
were
at
variance
;
and
for
that
reason
the
tutor
durst
not
venture
to
put
the
cause
on
such
an
issue
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
when
this
reference
was
mentioned
,
Jumble
,
who
was
naturally
jealous
,
suspected
that
Peregrine
had
a
promise
of
protection
before
he
undertook
to
commit
such
an
outrageous
insult
;
and
this
notion
had
such
an
effect
upon
him
,
that
he
resolved
to
devour
his
vexation
,
and
wait
for
a
more
proper
opportunity
of
gratifying
his
hate
.
<EOS>
Mean
while
copies
of
the
ballad
were
distributed
among
the
students
,
who
sung
it
under
the
very
nose
of
Mr
Jumble
,
to
the
tune
of
a
Cobler
there
was
,
&
c.
and
the
triumph
of
our
hero
was
compleat
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
his
whole
time
devoted
to
the
riotous
extravagancies
of
youth
.
<EOS>
He
enjoyed
many
lucid
intervals
,
during
which
he
contracted
a
more
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
classicks
,
applied
himself
to
the
reading
of
history
,
improved
his
taste
for
painting
and
musick
,
in
which
he
made
some
progress
;
and
above
all
things
,
cultivated
the
study
of
natural
philosophy
.
<EOS>
It
was
generally
after
a
course
of
close
attention
to
some
of
these
arts
and
sciences
,
that
his
disposition
broke
out
into
those
irregularities
and
wild
sallies
of
a
luxuriant
imagination
,
for
which
he
became
so
remarkable
;
and
he
was
perhaps
the
only
young
man
in
Oxford
,
who
at
the
same
time
maintained
an
intimate
and
friendly
intercourse
with
the
most
unthinking
,
as
well
as
with
the
most
sedate
students
at
the
university
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
young
man
of
Peregrine
's
vanity
,
inexperience
and
profusion
,
could
suit
his
expence
to
his
allowance
,
liberal
as
it
was
;
for
he
was
not
one
of
those
fortunate
people
who
are
born
oeconomists
,
and
knew
not
the
art
of
with
-
holding
his
purse
when
he
saw
his
companion
in
difficulty
:
thus
naturally
generous
and
expensive
,
he
squandered
away
his
money
,
and
made
a
most
splendid
appearance
upon
the
receipt
of
his
quarterly
appointment
;
but
long
before
the
third
month
was
elapsed
,
his
finances
were
consumed
,
and
as
he
could
not
stoop
to
ask
an
extraordinary
supply
,
was
too
proud
to
borrow
,
and
too
haughty
to
run
in
debt
with
tradesmen
,
he
devoted
those
periods
of
poverty
to
the
prosecution
of
his
studies
,
and
shone
forth
again
at
the
revolution
of
quarter
day
.
    
<EOS>
In
one
of
these
irruptions
he
and
some
of
his
companions
went
to
Windsor
,
in
order
to
see
the
royal
apartments
in
the
castle
,
whither
they
repaired
in
the
afternoon
,
and
as
Peregrine
stood
contemplating
the
picture
of
Hercules
and
Omphale
,
one
of
his
fellow
-
students
whispered
in
his
ear
,
"
Z####ds
!
<EOS>
Pickle
,
there
are
two
fine
girls
.
"
<EOS>
He
turned
instantly
about
,
and
in
one
of
them
recognized
his
almost
forgotten
Emilia
:
her
appearance
acted
upon
his
imagination
like
a
spark
of
fire
that
falls
among
gun
-
powder
;
that
passion
which
had
lain
dormant
for
the
space
of
two
years
flashed
up
in
a
moment
,
and
he
was
seized
with
an
universal
trepidation
.
<EOS>
She
perceived
and
partook
of
his
emotion
;
for
their
souls
,
like
unisons
,
vibrated
with
the
same
impulse
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
called
her
pride
and
resentment
to
her
aid
,
and
found
resolution
enough
to
retire
from
such
a
dangerous
scene
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
her
retreat
,
he
recollected
all
his
assurance
,
and
impelled
by
love
which
he
could
no
longer
resist
,
followed
her
into
the
next
room
,
where
in
the
most
disconcerted
manner
he
accosted
her
with
"
Your
humble
servant
,
Miss
Gauntlet
;
"
To
which
salutation
she
replied
,
with
an
affectation
of
indifference
that
did
not
,
however
,
conceal
her
agitation
,
"
Your
servant
,
Sir
;
"
and
immediately
extending
her
finger
towards
the
picture
of
Duns
Scotus
,
which
is
fixed
over
one
of
the
doors
,
asked
her
companion
in
a
strange
sort
of
giggling
tone
,
if
she
did
not
think
he
looked
like
a
conjurer
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
nettled
into
spirits
by
this
reception
,
answered
for
the
other
lady
,
"
that
it
was
an
easy
matter
to
be
a
conjurer
in
those
times
,
when
the
simplicity
of
the
age
assisted
his
divination
;
but
were
he
,
or
Merlin
himself
to
rise
from
the
dead
now
,
<EOS>
when
such
deceit
and
dissimulation
prevail
,
they
would
not
be
able
to
earn
their
bread
by
the
profession
.
"
<EOS>
"
 
<EOS>
O
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
said
she
,
(
turning
full
upon
him
)
without
doubt
they
would
adopt
new
maxims
;
'
tis
no
disparagement
in
this
enlightened
age
for
one
to
alter
one
's
opinion
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
No
sure
,
Madam
,
replied
the
youth
with
some
precipitation
,
provided
the
change
be
for
the
better
;
"
"
and
should
it
happen
otherwise
,
retorted
the
nymph
with
a
flirt
of
her
fan
,
inconstancy
will
never
want
countenance
from
the
practice
of
mankind
.
"
<EOS>
"
True
,
Madam
,
resumed
our
hero
,
fixing
his
eyes
upon
her
,
examples
of
levity
are
every
where
to
be
met
with
.
"
<EOS>
"
O
Lord
,
Sir
,
cried
Emilia
,
tossing
her
head
,
you
'll
scarce
ever
find
a
fop
without
it
.
"
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
his
companion
seeing
him
engaged
with
one
of
the
ladies
,
entered
into
conversation
with
the
other
;
and
in
order
to
favour
his
friend
's
gallantry
,
conducted
her
into
the
next
apartment
,
on
pretence
of
entertaining
her
with
the
sight
of
a
remarkable
piece
of
painting
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
laying
hold
on
this
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
the
object
of
his
love
,
assumed
a
most
seducing
tenderness
of
look
,
and
heaving
a
profound
sigh
,
asked
if
she
had
utterly
discarded
him
from
her
remembrance
.
<EOS>
Reddening
at
this
pathetic
question
,
which
recalled
the
memory
of
the
imagined
slight
he
had
put
upon
her
,
she
answered
in
great
confusion
,
"
Sir
,
I
believe
I
once
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
at
a
ball
in
Windchester
.
"
<EOS>
"
Miss
Emilia
,
said
he
,
very
gravely
,
will
you
be
so
candid
as
to
tell
me
what
misbehaviour
of
mine
you
are
pleased
to
punish
,
by
restricting
your
remembrance
to
that
single
occasion
?
"
<EOS>
"
Mr
Pickle
,
she
replied
in
the
same
tone
,
it
is
neither
my
province
nor
inclination
to
judge
your
conduct
;
and
therefore
you
misapply
your
question
when
you
ask
such
an
explanation
of
me
.
"
<EOS>
"
At
least
,
resumed
our
lover
,
give
me
the
melancholy
satisfaction
to
know
for
what
offence
of
my
committing
you
refused
to
take
the
least
notice
of
that
letter
which
I
had
the
honour
to
write
from
Winchester
by
your
own
express
permission
.
"
<EOS>
"
Your
letter
,
said
Miss
with
great
vivacity
,
neither
required
,
nor
in
my
opinion
,
deserved
an
answer
;
and
to
be
free
with
you
,
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
,
it
was
but
a
shallow
artifice
to
rid
yourself
of
a
correspondence
you
had
deigned
to
sollicit
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Peregrine
confounded
at
this
repartee
,
replied
that
howsoever
he
might
have
failed
in
point
of
elegance
or
discretion
,
he
was
sure
he
had
not
been
deficient
in
expressions
of
respect
and
devotion
for
those
charms
which
it
was
his
pride
to
adore
:
    
"
<EOS>
As
for
the
verses
,
said
he
,
I
own
they
were
unworthy
of
the
theme
,
but
I
flattered
myself
that
they
would
have
merited
your
acceptance
,
though
not
your
approbation
,
and
been
considered
not
so
much
as
the
proof
of
my
genius
,
as
the
genuine
effusion
of
my
love
.
"
<EOS>
"
Verses
?
<EOS>
cried
Emilia
with
an
air
of
astonishment
,
<EOS>
what
verses
?
<EOS>
I
really
do
n't
understand
you
.
"
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
thunderstruck
at
this
exclamation
,
to
which
,
after
a
long
pause
,
he
answered
,
"
I
begin
to
suspect
,
and
heartily
wish
it
may
appear
that
we
have
misunderstood
each
other
from
the
beginning
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
Miss
Gauntlet
,
did
not
you
find
a
copy
of
verses
inclosed
in
that
unfortunate
letter
?
"
<EOS>
"
Truly
,
Sir
,
(
said
the
lady
)
<EOS>
I
am
not
so
much
of
a
connoiseur
as
to
distinguish
whether
that
facetious
production
which
you
merrily
stile
an
unfortunate
letter
was
composed
in
verse
or
prose
;
but
,
methinks
,
the
jest
is
a
little
too
stale
to
be
brought
upon
the
carpet
again
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
tripped
away
to
her
companion
,
and
left
her
lover
in
a
most
tumultuous
suspence
.
<EOS>
He
now
perceived
that
her
neglect
of
his
addresses
when
he
was
at
Winchester
,
must
have
been
owing
to
some
mystery
which
he
could
not
comprehend
;
and
she
began
to
suspect
and
to
hope
that
the
letter
which
she
received
was
spurious
,
though
she
could
not
conceive
how
that
could
possibly
happen
,
as
it
had
been
delivered
to
her
by
the
hands
of
his
own
servant
.
    
<EOS>
However
,
she
resolved
to
leave
the
task
of
unravelling
the
affair
,
to
him
who
,
she
knew
,
would
infallibly
exert
himself
for
his
own
as
well
as
her
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
She
was
not
deceived
in
her
opinion
;
he
went
up
to
her
again
at
the
staircase
,
and
as
they
were
unprovided
with
a
male
attendant
,
insisted
upon
squiring
the
ladies
to
their
lodgings
.
<EOS>
Emilia
saw
his
drift
,
which
was
no
other
than
to
know
where
she
lived
;
and
though
she
approved
of
his
finesse
,
thought
it
was
incumbent
upon
her
for
the
support
of
her
own
dignity
to
decline
his
civility
:
she
therefore
thanked
him
for
his
polite
offer
,
but
would
by
no
means
consent
to
his
giving
himself
such
unnecessary
trouble
,
especially
as
they
had
a
very
little
way
to
walk
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
repulsed
by
this
refusal
,
the
nature
of
which
he
perfectly
understood
;
nor
was
she
sorry
to
see
him
persevere
in
his
determination
;
he
therefore
accompanied
them
in
their
return
,
and
made
divers
efforts
to
speak
with
Emilia
in
particular
:
but
she
had
a
spice
of
the
coquette
in
her
disposition
,
and
being
determined
to
whet
his
impatience
,
artfully
baffled
all
his
endeavours
,
by
keeping
her
companion
continually
engaged
in
the
conversation
,
which
turned
upon
the
venerable
appearance
and
imperial
situation
of
the
place
.
<EOS>
Thus
tantalized
,
he
lounged
with
them
to
the
door
of
the
house
in
which
they
lodged
,
when
his
mistress
perceiving
by
the
countenance
of
her
comrade
,
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
desiring
him
to
walk
in
,
checked
her
intention
with
a
frown
,
then
turning
to
Mr
Pickle
,
dropped
him
a
very
formal
curt'sey
,
seized
the
other
young
lady
by
the
arm
,
and
saying
"
Come
,
cousin
Sophy
,
"
vanished
in
a
moment
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXVI
<EOS>
After
sundry
unsuccessful
efforts
,
he
finds
means
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
his
mistress
;
and
a
reconciliation
ensues
.
   
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
disconcerted
at
their
sudden
disappearance
,
stood
for
some
minutes
gapping
in
the
street
,
before
he
could
get
the
better
of
his
surprize
;
and
then
deliberated
with
himself
whether
he
should
demand
immediate
admittance
to
his
mistress
,
or
choose
some
other
method
of
application
.
<EOS>
Piqued
at
her
abrupt
behaviour
,
though
pleased
with
her
spirit
,
he
set
his
invention
to
work
,
in
order
to
contrive
some
means
of
seeing
her
;
and
in
a
fit
of
musing
arrived
at
the
inn
,
where
he
found
his
companions
whom
he
had
left
at
the
Castle
-
gate
.
<EOS>
They
had
already
made
inquiry
about
the
ladies
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
learnt
that
Miss
Sophy
was
daughter
of
a
gentleman
in
town
to
whom
his
mistress
was
related
;
that
an
intimate
friendship
subsisted
between
the
two
young
ladies
;
that
Emilia
had
lived
about
a
month
with
her
cousin
,
and
appeared
at
the
last
assembly
,
where
she
was
universally
admired
;
and
that
several
young
gentlemen
of
fortune
had
since
that
time
teized
her
with
addresses
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
ambition
was
flattered
,
and
his
passion
inflamed
with
this
intelligence
;
and
he
swore
within
himself
that
he
would
not
quit
the
spot
until
he
should
have
obtained
an
indisputed
victory
over
all
his
rivals
.
    
<EOS>
That
same
evening
he
composed
a
most
eloquent
epistle
,
in
which
he
earnestly
intreated
that
she
would
favour
him
with
an
opportunity
of
vindicating
his
conduct
;
but
she
would
neither
receive
his
billet
nor
see
his
messenger
.
<EOS>
Baulked
in
this
effort
,
he
inclosed
it
in
a
new
cover
directed
by
another
hand
,
and
ordered
Pipes
to
ride
next
morning
to
London
,
on
purpose
to
deliver
it
at
the
post
-
office
;
that
coming
by
such
conveyance
,
she
might
have
no
suspicion
of
the
author
,
and
open
it
before
she
should
be
aware
of
the
deceit
.
    
<EOS>
Three
days
he
waited
patiently
for
the
effect
of
this
stratagem
,
and
in
the
afternoon
of
the
fourth
,
ventured
to
hazard
a
formal
visit
,
in
quality
of
an
old
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
But
here
too
he
failed
in
his
attempt
;
she
was
indisposed
and
could
not
see
company
.
<EOS>
These
obstacles
served
only
to
increase
his
eagerness
;
he
still
adhered
to
his
former
resolution
;
and
his
companions
understanding
his
determination
,
left
him
next
day
to
his
own
inventions
.
<EOS>
Thus
relinquished
to
his
own
ideas
,
he
doubled
his
assiduity
,
and
practised
every
method
his
imagination
could
suggest
,
in
order
to
promote
his
plan
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
was
stationed
all
day
long
within
sight
of
her
door
,
that
he
might
be
able
to
give
his
master
an
account
of
her
motions
;
but
she
never
went
abroad
except
to
visit
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
was
always
housed
before
Peregrine
could
be
apprized
of
her
appearance
.
<EOS>
He
went
to
church
with
a
view
of
attracting
her
notice
,
and
humbled
his
deportment
before
her
;
but
she
was
so
mischievously
devout
as
to
look
at
nothing
but
her
book
,
so
that
he
was
not
favoured
with
one
glance
of
regard
.
    
<EOS>
He
frequented
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
attempted
to
contract
an
acquaintance
with
Miss
Sophy
's
father
,
who
,
he
hoped
,
would
invite
him
to
his
house
;
this
expectation
was
also
defeated
.
<EOS>
The
prudent
gentleman
looked
upon
him
as
one
of
those
forward
fortune
-
hunters
who
go
about
the
country
seeking
whom
they
may
devour
,
and
warily
discouraged
all
his
advances
.
<EOS>
Chagrined
by
so
many
unsuccessful
endeavours
,
he
began
to
despair
of
accomplishing
his
aim
,
and
as
the
last
suggestion
of
his
art
,
paid
off
his
lodging
,
took
horse
at
noon
,
and
departed
,
in
all
appearance
,
for
the
place
from
whence
he
had
come
.
<EOS>
He
rode
,
however
,
but
a
few
miles
,
and
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
returned
unseen
,
alighted
at
another
inn
,
ordered
Pipes
to
stay
within
doors
,
and
keeping
himself
incognito
,
employed
another
person
as
a
centinel
upon
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
he
reaped
the
fruits
of
his
ingenuity
.
<EOS>
Next
day
in
the
afternoon
he
was
informed
by
his
spy
,
that
the
two
young
ladies
were
gone
to
walk
in
the
park
,
whither
he
followed
them
on
the
instant
,
fully
determined
to
come
to
an
explanation
with
his
mistress
,
even
in
presence
of
her
friend
,
who
might
possibly
be
prevailed
upon
to
interest
herself
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
saw
them
at
such
a
distance
that
they
could
not
return
to
town
before
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
putting
his
resolution
in
practice
,
he
mended
his
pace
,
and
found
means
to
appear
before
them
so
suddenly
,
that
Emilia
could
not
help
expressing
her
surprize
in
a
scream
.
<EOS>
Our
lover
putting
on
a
mein
of
humility
and
mortification
,
begged
to
know
if
her
resentment
was
implacable
;
and
asked
why
she
had
so
cruelly
refused
to
grant
him
the
common
privilege
that
every
criminal
enjoyed
.
    
<EOS>
"
Dear
Miss
Sophy
,
said
he
,
addressing
himself
to
her
companion
,
give
me
leave
to
implore
your
intercession
with
your
cousin
;
I
am
sure
you
have
humanity
enough
to
espouse
my
cause
,
did
you
but
know
the
justice
of
it
;
and
I
flatter
myself
,
that
by
your
kind
interposition
,
I
may
be
able
to
rectify
that
fatal
misunderstanding
which
hath
made
me
wretched
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
said
Sophy
,
you
appear
like
a
gentleman
,
<EOS>
and
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
your
behaviour
has
been
always
suitable
to
your
appearance
;
but
you
must
excuse
me
from
undertaking
any
such
office
in
behalf
of
a
person
whom
I
have
not
the
honour
to
know
.
"
<EOS>
"
Madam
,
answered
Peregrine
,
I
hope
Miss
Emy
will
justify
my
pretensions
to
that
character
,
notwithstanding
the
mystery
of
her
displeasure
,
which
upon
my
honour
I
can
not
for
my
soul
explain
.
"
<EOS>
"
Lord
!
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
,
said
Emilia
,
(
who
had
by
this
time
recollected
herself
)
<EOS>
I
never
questioned
your
gallantry
and
taste
,
but
I
am
resolved
that
you
shall
never
have
cause
to
exercise
your
talents
at
my
expence
;
so
that
you
teize
yourself
and
me
to
no
purpose
:
come
,
Sophy
<EOS>
,
let
us
walk
home
again
.
"
<EOS>
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
madam
,
(
cried
the
lover
with
great
emotion
)
why
will
you
distract
me
with
such
barbarous
indifference
?
<EOS>
Stay
,
dear
Emilia
!
<EOS>
I
conjure
you
on
my
knees
to
stay
and
hear
me
:
by
all
that
is
sacred
!
<EOS>
I
was
not
to
blame
,
you
must
have
been
imposed
upon
by
some
villain
who
envied
my
good
fortune
,
and
took
some
treacherous
method
to
ruin
my
love
.
"
    
<EOS>
Miss
Sophy
,
who
possessed
a
large
stock
of
good
nature
,
and
to
whom
her
cousin
had
communicated
the
cause
of
her
reserve
,
seeing
the
young
gentleman
so
much
affected
with
that
disdain
which
she
knew
to
be
feigned
,
laid
hold
on
Emilia
's
sleeve
,
saying
with
a
smile
,
"
Not
quite
so
fast
,
Emily
<EOS>
;
I
begin
to
perceive
that
this
is
a
love
-
quarrel
,
and
therefore
there
may
be
hopes
of
a
reconciliation
;
for
I
suppose
both
parties
are
open
to
conviction
.
"
<EOS>
"
For
my
own
part
,
(
cried
Peregrine
with
great
eagerness
)
<EOS>
I
appeal
to
Miss
Sophy
's
decision
.
<EOS>
But
why
do
I
say
appeal
?
<EOS>
Tho
<EOS>
'
I
am
conscious
of
having
committed
no
offence
,
I
am
ready
to
submit
to
any
penance
,
let
it
be
never
so
rigorous
,
that
my
fair
enslaver
herself
shall
impose
,
provided
it
will
intitle
me
to
her
favour
and
forgiveness
at
last
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Emily
well
nigh
overcome
by
this
declaration
,
told
him
that
as
she
taxed
him
with
no
guilt
,
she
expected
no
attonement
;
and
pressed
her
companion
to
return
into
town
.
<EOS>
But
Sophy
,
who
was
too
indulgent
to
her
friend
's
real
inclination
to
comply
with
her
request
,
observed
that
the
gentleman
seemed
so
reasonable
in
his
concessions
,
she
began
to
think
her
cousin
was
in
the
wrong
,
and
felt
herself
disposed
to
act
as
umpire
in
the
dispute
.
    
<EOS>
Overjoyed
at
this
condescension
,
Mr
Pickle
thanked
her
in
the
most
rapturous
terms
,
and
in
the
transport
of
his
expectation
,
kissed
the
hand
of
his
kind
mediatrix
;
a
circumstance
which
had
a
remarkable
effect
on
the
countenance
of
Emilia
,
who
did
not
seem
to
relish
the
warmth
of
his
acknowledgement
.
    
<EOS>
After
many
supplications
on
one
hand
,
and
pressing
remonstrances
on
the
other
,
she
yielded
at
length
,
and
turning
to
her
lover
,
while
her
face
was
overspread
with
blushes
,
"
Well
,
Sir
,
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
supposing
I
were
to
put
the
difference
on
that
issue
,
how
could
you
excuse
the
ridiculous
letter
which
you
sent
to
me
from
Winchester
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
expostulation
introduced
a
discussion
of
the
whole
affair
,
in
which
all
the
circumstances
were
canvassed
;
and
Emilia
still
affirmed
with
great
heat
,
that
the
letter
must
have
been
calculated
to
affront
her
;
for
she
could
not
suppose
the
author
was
so
weak
as
to
design
it
for
any
other
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
still
retained
in
his
memory
the
substance
of
this
unlucky
epistle
,
as
well
as
the
verses
which
were
inclosed
,
could
recollect
no
particular
expression
which
could
have
justly
given
the
least
umbrage
;
and
therefore
in
the
agonies
of
perplexity
,
begged
that
the
whole
might
be
submitted
to
the
judgment
of
Miss
Sophy
;
and
faithfully
promised
to
stand
to
her
award
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
proposal
was
with
seeming
reluctance
embraced
by
Emilia
,
and
an
appointment
made
to
meet
next
day
in
the
same
place
,
whither
both
parties
were
desired
to
come
provided
with
their
credentials
,
according
to
which
definitive
sentence
would
be
pronounced
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
having
succeeded
thus
far
,
overwhelmed
Sophy
with
acknowledgments
on
account
of
her
generous
mediation
,
and
in
the
course
of
their
walk
,
which
Emilia
was
now
in
no
hurry
to
conclude
,
whispered
a
great
many
tender
protestations
in
the
ear
of
his
mistress
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
continued
to
act
upon
the
reserve
,
until
her
doubts
should
be
more
fully
resolved
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
having
found
means
to
amuse
them
in
the
fields
till
the
twilight
,
was
obliged
to
wish
them
good
even
,
after
having
obtained
a
solemn
repetition
of
their
promise
to
meet
him
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
;
and
then
retreated
to
his
apartment
,
where
he
spent
the
whole
night
in
various
conjectures
on
the
subject
of
this
letter
,
the
gordian
knot
of
which
he
could
by
no
means
untie
.
    
<EOS>
One
<EOS>
while
he
imagined
that
some
wag
had
played
a
trick
upon
his
messenger
,
in
consequence
of
which
Emilia
had
received
a
supposititious
letter
;
but
upon
further
reflection
,
he
could
not
conceive
the
practicability
of
any
such
deceit
.
<EOS>
Then
he
began
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
mistress
,
who
,
perhaps
,
had
only
made
that
an
handle
for
discarding
him
,
at
the
request
of
some
favoured
rival
;
but
his
own
integrity
forbad
him
to
harbour
this
mean
suspicion
;
and
therefore
he
was
again
involved
in
the
labyrinth
of
perplexity
.
<EOS>
Next
day
he
waited
on
the
rack
of
impatience
for
the
hour
of
five
in
the
afternoon
,
which
no
sooner
struck
,
than
he
ordered
Pipes
to
attend
him
,
in
case
there
should
be
occasion
for
his
evidence
;
and
repaired
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
he
had
not
tarried
five
minutes
before
the
ladies
appeared
.
<EOS>
Mutual
compliments
being
passed
,
and
the
attendant
stationed
at
a
convenient
distance
,
Peregrine
persuaded
them
to
sit
down
upon
the
grass
,
under
the
shade
of
a
spreading
oak
,
that
they
might
be
more
at
their
ease
;
while
he
stretched
himself
at
their
feet
,
and
desired
that
the
paper
on
which
his
doom
depended
might
be
examined
.
<EOS>
It
was
accordingly
put
into
the
hand
of
his
fair
arbitress
,
who
read
it
immediately
with
an
audible
voice
.
<EOS>
The
first
two
words
of
it
were
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
he
started
with
great
emotion
,
and
raised
himself
upon
his
hand
and
knee
,
in
which
posture
he
listened
to
the
rest
of
the
sentence
;
and
then
sprung
upon
his
feet
in
the
utmost
astonishment
,
and
glowing
with
resentment
at
the
same
time
,
exclaimed
"
Hell
and
the
devil
!
<EOS>
what
's
all
that
?
<EOS>
Sure
you
make
a
jest
of
me
,
madam
.
"
<EOS>
"
Pray
,
Sir
,
(
said
Sophy
)
give
me
the
hearing
for
a
few
moments
,
and
then
urge
what
you
shall
think
proper
in
your
own
defence
.
"
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
cautioned
him
,
she
proceeded
;
but
before
she
had
finished
one
half
of
the
performance
,
her
gravity
forsook
her
,
and
she
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
,
in
which
neither
of
the
lovers
could
help
joining
,
notwithstanding
the
resentment
which
at
that
instant
prevailed
in
the
breasts
of
both
.
<EOS>
The
judge
,
however
,
in
a
little
time
,
resumed
her
solemnity
,
and
having
read
the
remaining
part
of
this
curious
epistle
,
all
three
continued
staring
at
each
other
alternately
for
the
space
of
half
a
minute
,
and
then
broke
forth
at
the
same
instant
in
another
paroxism
of
mirth
.
<EOS>
From
this
unanimous
convulsion
,
one
would
have
thought
that
both
parties
were
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
joke
;
yet
this
was
by
no
means
the
case
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
imagined
that
notwithstanding
his
affected
surprize
,
her
lover
in
spite
of
himself
had
renewed
the
laugh
at
her
expence
,
and
in
so
doing
,
applauded
his
own
unmannerly
ridicule
.
<EOS>
This
supposition
could
not
not
fail
of
raising
and
reviving
her
indignation
,
while
Peregrine
highly
resented
the
indignity
with
which
he
supposed
himself
treated
,
in
their
attempting
to
make
him
the
dupe
of
such
a
gross
and
ludicrous
artifice
.
<EOS>
This
being
the
situation
of
their
thoughts
,
their
mirth
was
succeeded
by
a
mutual
gloominess
of
aspect
,
and
the
judge
addressing
herself
to
Mr
Pickle
,
<EOS>
asked
if
he
had
any
thing
to
offer
why
sentence
should
not
be
pronounced
.
"
<EOS>
Madam
,
answered
the
culprit
,
I
am
sorry
to
find
myself
so
low
in
the
opinion
of
your
cousin
,
as
to
be
thought
capable
of
being
deceived
by
such
a
shallow
contrivance
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Sir
,
said
Emily
,
the
contrivance
is
your
own
,
and
I
can
not
help
admiring
your
confidence
in
imputing
it
to
me
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
honour
,
Miss
Emily
,
resumed
our
hero
,
you
wrong
my
understanding
as
well
as
my
love
,
in
accusing
me
of
having
written
such
a
silly
impertinent
performance
:
the
very
appearance
and
address
of
it
is
so
unlike
the
letter
which
I
did
myself
the
honour
to
write
,
that
I
dare
say
my
man
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
will
remember
the
difference
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
extended
his
voice
,
and
beckoned
to
Pipes
,
who
immediately
drew
near
.
<EOS>
His
mistress
seemed
to
object
to
the
evidence
,
by
observing
that
to
be
sure
Mr
Pipes
had
his
cue
;
when
Peregrine
begging
she
would
spare
him
the
mortification
of
considering
him
in
such
a
dishonourable
light
,
desired
his
valet
to
examine
the
outside
of
the
letter
,
and
recollect
if
it
was
the
same
which
he
had
delivered
to
Miss
Gauntlet
about
two
years
ago
.
<EOS>
Pipes
having
taken
a
superficial
view
of
it
,
pulled
up
his
breeches
,
saying
,
"
Mayhap
it
is
,
but
we
have
made
so
many
trips
,
and
been
in
so
many
creeks
and
corners
since
that
time
,
that
I
ca
n't
pretend
to
be
certain
;
for
I
neither
keep
journal
nor
logbook
of
our
proceedings
.
<EOS>
"
Emilia
commended
him
for
his
candour
,
at
the
same
darting
a
sarcastic
look
at
his
master
,
as
if
she
thought
he
had
tampered
with
his
servant
's
integrity
in
vain
;
and
Peregrine
began
to
rave
and
curse
his
fate
for
having
subjected
him
to
such
mean
suspicion
,
attesting
heaven
and
earth
in
the
most
earnest
manner
,
that
far
from
having
composed
and
conveyed
that
stupid
production
,
he
had
never
seen
it
before
,
nor
been
privy
to
the
least
circumstance
of
the
plan
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
now
for
the
first
time
,
perceived
the
mischief
which
he
had
occasioned
,
and
moved
with
the
transports
of
his
master
,
for
whom
he
had
a
most
inviolable
attachment
,
frankly
declared
he
was
ready
to
make
oath
that
Mr
Pickle
had
no
hand
in
the
letter
which
he
delivered
.
<EOS>
All
three
were
amazed
at
this
confession
,
the
meaning
of
which
they
could
not
comprehend
;
and
Peregrine
after
some
pause
,
leaped
upon
Pipes
,
and
seizing
him
by
the
throat
,
exclaimed
in
an
extasy
of
rage
,
"
Rascal
!
<EOS>
tell
me
this
instant
<EOS>
what
became
of
the
letter
I
intrusted
to
your
care
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
patient
valet
,
half
strangled
<EOS>
as
he
was
,
squirted
a
collection
of
tobacco
juice
out
of
one
corner
of
his
mouth
,
and
with
great
deliberation
replied
,
"
Why
burnt
it
,
you
would
n't
have
me
give
the
young
woman
a
thing
that
shook
all
in
the
wind
in
tatters
,
would
you
?
"
<EOS>
The
ladies
interposed
in
behalf
of
the
distressed
squire
,
from
whom
,
by
dint
of
questions
which
he
had
neither
art
nor
inclination
to
evade
,
they
extorted
an
explanation
of
the
whole
affair
.
    
<EOS>
Such
ridiculous
simplicity
and
innocence
of
intention
appeared
in
the
composition
of
his
expedient
,
that
even
the
remembrance
of
all
the
chagrin
which
it
had
produced
,
could
not
rouse
their
indignation
,
or
enable
them
to
resist
a
third
eruption
of
laughter
which
they
forthwith
underwent
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
was
dismissed
with
many
menacing
injunctions
,
to
beware
of
such
conduct
for
the
future
;
Emilia
stood
with
a
confusion
of
joy
and
tenderness
in
her
countenance
;
Peregrine
's
eyes
kindled
into
rapture
,
and
when
Miss
Sophy
pronounced
the
sentence
of
reconciliation
,
advanced
to
his
mistress
,
saying
,
"
Truth
is
mighty
,
and
will
prevail
;
"
then
clasping
her
in
his
arms
,
very
impudently
ravished
a
kiss
,
which
she
had
not
power
to
refuse
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
,
such
was
the
impulse
of
his
joy
,
that
he
took
the
same
freedom
with
the
lips
of
Sophy
,
calling
her
his
kind
mediatrix
and
guardian
angel
,
and
behaved
with
such
extravagance
of
transport
,
as
plainly
evinced
the
fervour
and
sincerity
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
repeat
the
tender
protestations
that
were
uttered
on
one
side
,
or
describe
the
bewitching
glances
of
approbation
with
which
they
were
received
on
the
other
;
suffice
it
to
say
,
that
the
endearing
intimacy
of
their
former
connexion
was
instantly
renewed
,
and
Sophy
,
who
congratulated
them
upon
the
happy
termination
of
their
quarrel
,
favoured
with
their
mutual
confidence
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
happy
pacification
,
they
deliberated
upon
the
means
of
seeing
each
other
often
;
and
as
he
could
not
without
some
previous
introduction
visit
her
openly
at
the
house
of
her
relation
,
they
agreed
to
meet
every
afternoon
in
the
park
till
the
next
assembly
,
at
which
he
would
solicit
her
as
a
partner
,
and
she
be
unengaged
,
in
expectation
of
his
request
.
<EOS>
By
this
connexion
he
would
be
intitled
to
visit
her
next
day
,
and
thus
an
avowed
correspondence
would
of
course
commence
.
<EOS>
This
plan
was
actually
put
in
execution
,
and
attended
with
a
circumstance
which
had
well
nigh
produced
some
mischievous
consequence
,
had
not
Peregrine
's
good
fortune
been
superior
to
his
discretion
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXVII
<EOS>
He
atchieves
an
adventure
at
the
assembly
,
and
quarrels
with
his
governor
.
   
<EOS>
At
the
assembly
,
were
no
fewer
than
three
gentlemen
of
fortune
,
who
rivalled
our
lover
in
his
passion
for
Emilia
,
and
who
had
severally
begged
the
honour
of
dancing
with
her
upon
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
She
had
excused
herself
to
each
,
on
pretence
of
a
slight
indisposition
that
she
foresaw
would
detain
her
from
the
ball
,
and
desired
they
would
provide
themselves
with
other
partners
.
<EOS>
Obliged
to
admit
her
excuse
,
they
accordingly
followed
her
advice
;
and
after
they
had
engaged
themselves
beyond
the
power
of
retracting
,
had
the
mortification
to
see
her
there
unclaimed
.
    
<EOS>
They
in
their
turns
made
up
to
her
,
and
expressed
their
surprize
and
concern
at
finding
her
in
the
assembly
unprovided
,
after
she
had
declined
their
invitation
;
but
she
told
them
that
her
cold
had
forsaken
her
since
she
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
,
and
that
she
would
rely
upon
accident
for
a
partner
.
<EOS>
Just
as
she
pronounced
these
words
to
the
last
of
the
three
,
Peregrine
advanced
as
an
utter
stranger
,
bowed
with
great
respect
,
<EOS>
told
her
he
understood
she
was
disengaged
,
and
would
think
himself
highly
honoured
in
being
accepted
as
her
partner
for
the
night
;
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
succeed
in
his
application
.
    
<EOS>
As
they
were
by
far
the
handsomest
and
best
accomplished
couple
in
the
room
,
they
could
not
fail
of
attracting
the
notice
and
admiration
of
the
spectators
,
which
inflamed
the
jealousy
of
his
three
competitors
,
who
immediately
entered
into
a
conspiracy
against
this
gaudy
stranger
,
whom
as
their
rival
,
they
resolved
to
affront
in
publick
.
<EOS>
Pursuant
to
the
plan
which
they
projected
for
this
purpose
,
the
first
country
-
dance
was
no
sooner
concluded
,
than
one
of
them
with
his
partner
took
place
of
Peregrine
and
his
mistress
,
contrary
to
the
regulations
of
the
ball
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
imputing
this
behaviour
to
inadvertency
,
informed
the
gentleman
of
his
mistake
,
and
civilly
desired
he
would
rectify
his
error
.
<EOS>
The
other
told
him
,
in
an
imperious
tone
,
that
he
wanted
none
of
his
advice
,
and
bad
<EOS>
him
mind
his
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
answered
with
some
warmth
,
and
insisted
upon
his
right
;
a
dispute
commenced
,
high
words
ensued
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
our
impetuous
youth
hearing
himself
reviled
with
the
appellation
of
scoundrel
,
pulled
off
his
antagonist
's
periwig
,
and
flung
it
in
his
face
.
<EOS>
The
ladies
immediately
shriek'd
,
the
gentlemen
interposed
,
Emilia
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
,
and
conducted
to
her
seat
by
her
youthful
admirer
,
who
begged
pardon
for
having
discomposed
her
,
and
vindicated
what
he
had
done
,
by
representing
the
necessity
he
was
under
to
resent
the
provocation
he
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
Though
she
could
not
help
owning
the
justice
of
his
plea
,
she
was
not
the
less
concerned
at
the
dangerous
situation
in
which
he
had
involved
himself
,
and
in
the
utmost
consternation
and
anxiety
,
insisted
upon
going
directly
home
<EOS>
:
he
could
not
resist
her
importunities
,
and
her
cousin
being
determined
to
accompany
her
,
he
escorted
them
to
their
lodgings
,
where
he
wished
them
good
night
,
after
having
,
in
order
to
quiet
their
apprehensions
,
protested
that
if
his
opponent
was
satisfied
,
he
should
never
take
any
step
towards
the
prosecution
of
the
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Mean
while
the
assembly
-
room
became
a
scene
of
tumult
and
uproar
;
the
person
who
conceived
himself
injured
,
seeing
Peregrine
retire
,
struggled
with
his
companions
who
with
-
held
him
,
in
order
to
pursue
and
take
satisfaction
of
our
hero
,
whom
he
loaded
with
terms
of
abuse
,
and
challenged
to
single
combat
.
    
<EOS>
The
director
of
the
ball
held
a
consultation
with
all
the
subscribers
who
were
present
,
and
it
was
determined
by
a
majority
of
votes
,
that
the
two
gentlemen
who
had
occasioned
the
disturbance
,
should
be
desired
to
withdraw
.
<EOS>
This
resolution
being
signified
to
one
of
the
parties
then
present
,
he
made
some
difficulty
of
complying
,
but
was
persuaded
to
submit
by
his
two
confederates
,
who
accompanied
him
to
the
street
-
door
,
where
he
was
met
by
Peregrine
on
his
return
to
the
assembly
.
    
<EOS>
This
choleric
gentleman
,
who
was
a
country
squire
,
no
sooner
saw
his
rival
,
than
he
began
to
brandish
his
cudgel
in
a
menacing
posture
,
when
our
adventurous
youth
stepping
back
with
one
foot
,
laid
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
his
sword
,
which
he
drew
half
way
out
of
the
scabbard
.
<EOS>
This
attitude
,
and
the
sight
of
the
blade
which
glittened
by
moonlight
in
his
face
,
checked
in
some
sort
,
the
ardour
of
his
assailant
,
who
desired
he
would
lay
aside
his
toaster
,
and
take
a
bout
with
him
at
equal
arms
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
an
expert
cudgel
-
player
,
accepted
the
invitation
,
and
exchanging
weapons
with
Pipes
who
stood
behind
him
,
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defence
,
and
received
the
attack
of
his
adversary
,
who
struck
at
random
without
either
skill
or
oeconomy
.
<EOS>
Pickle
could
have
beaten
the
cudgel
out
of
his
hand
at
the
first
blow
,
but
as
in
that
case
he
would
have
been
obliged
in
honour
to
give
immediate
quarter
,
he
resolved
to
discipline
his
antagonist
without
endeavouring
to
disable
him
until
he
should
be
heartily
satisfied
with
the
vengeance
he
had
taken
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
returned
the
salute
,
and
raised
such
a
clatter
about
the
squire
's
pate
,
that
one
who
had
heard
without
seeing
the
application
,
would
have
mistaken
the
sound
for
that
of
a
salt
-
box
,
in
the
hand
of
a
dext'rous
Merry
Andrew
,
belonging
to
one
of
the
booths
at
Bartholomew
Fair
.
<EOS>
Neither
was
this
salutation
confined
to
his
head
;
his
shoulders
,
arms
,
thighs
,
ancles
and
ribs
,
were
visited
with
amazing
rapidity
,
while
Tom
Pipes
founded
the
charge
through
his
fist
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
tired
-
with
this
exercise
,
which
had
almost
bereft
his
enemy
of
sensation
,
at
last
struck
the
decisive
blow
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
squire
's
weapon
flew
out
of
his
grasp
,
and
he
allowed
our
hero
to
be
the
better
man
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
acknowledgment
,
the
victor
walked
up
stairs
with
such
elevation
of
spirits
and
insolence
of
mein
,
that
no
body
chose
to
intimate
the
resolution
which
had
been
taken
in
his
absence
,
and
having
amused
himself
for
some
time
in
beholding
the
country
dances
<EOS>
,
he
retreated
to
his
lodging
,
where
he
indulged
himself
all
night
in
the
contemplation
of
his
own
success
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
in
the
forenoon
he
went
to
visit
his
partner
,
and
the
gentleman
at
whose
house
she
lived
,
having
been
informed
of
his
family
and
condition
,
received
him
with
great
courtesy
,
as
the
acquaintance
of
his
cousin
Gauntlet
,
and
invited
him
to
dinner
that
same
day
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
was
remarkably
well
pleased
,
when
she
understood
the
issue
of
his
adventure
,
which
began
to
make
some
noise
in
town
,
even
though
it
deprived
her
of
a
wealthy
admirer
;
for
the
squire
having
consulted
an
attorney
about
the
nature
of
the
dispute
,
in
hopes
of
being
able
to
prosecute
Peregrine
for
an
assault
,
and
finding
little
encouragement
to
go
to
law
,
resolved
to
pocket
the
insult
and
injury
he
had
undergone
,
and
to
discontinue
his
addresses
to
her
who
was
the
cause
of
both
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
being
told
by
his
mistress
that
she
proposed
to
stay
a
fortnight
longer
at
Windsor
,
determined
to
enjoy
her
company
all
that
time
,
and
then
to
give
her
a
convoy
to
the
house
of
her
mother
,
whom
he
longed
to
see
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
plan
,
he
every
day
contrived
some
fresh
party
of
pleasure
for
the
ladies
,
to
whom
he
had
by
this
time
free
access
;
and
intangled
himself
so
much
in
the
snares
of
love
,
that
he
seemed
quite
enchanted
by
Emilia
's
charms
,
which
were
now
indeed
almost
irresistible
.
<EOS>
While
he
thus
heedlessly
roved
in
the
flowery
paths
of
pleasure
,
his
governor
at
Oxford
alarmed
at
the
unusual
duration
of
his
absence
,
went
to
the
young
gentlemen
who
had
accompanied
him
in
his
excursion
,
and
very
earnestly
intreated
them
to
tell
him
what
they
knew
concerning
his
pupil
;
they
accordingly
gave
him
an
account
of
the
rencounter
that
happened
between
Peregrine
and
Miss
Emily
Gauntlet
in
the
castle
,
and
mentioned
circumstances
sufficient
to
convince
him
that
his
charge
was
very
dangerously
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
Far
from
having
an
authority
over
Peregrine
,
Mr
Jolter
durst
not
even
disoblige
him
,
and
therefore
,
instead
of
writing
to
the
commodore
,
he
took
horse
immediately
,
and
that
same
night
reached
Windsor
,
where
he
found
his
stray
sheep
very
much
surprised
at
his
unexpected
arrival
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
desiring
to
have
some
serious
conversation
with
him
,
they
shut
themselves
up
in
an
apartment
,
when
Jolter
with
great
solemnity
,
communicated
the
cause
of
his
journey
,
which
was
no
other
than
his
concern
for
his
pupil
's
welfare
;
and
very
gravely
undertook
to
prove
by
mathematical
demonstration
,
that
this
intrigue
,
if
further
pursued
,
would
tend
to
the
young
gentleman
's
ruin
and
disgrace
.
<EOS>
This
singular
proposition
raised
the
curiosity
of
Peregrine
,
who
promised
to
yield
all
manner
of
attention
,
and
desired
him
to
begin
without
further
preamble
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
,
encouraged
by
this
appearance
of
candour
,
expressed
his
satisfaction
in
finding
him
so
open
to
conviction
,
and
told
him
he
would
proceed
upon
geometrical
principles
.
<EOS>
Then
hemming
thrice
,
observed
,
that
no
mathematical
inquiries
could
be
carried
on
,
except
upon
certain
data
,
or
concessions
to
truths
,
that
were
self
-
evident
;
and
therefore
he
must
crave
his
assent
to
a
few
axioms
,
which
he
was
sure
Mr
Pickle
would
see
no
reason
to
dispute
.
<EOS>
"
In
the
first
place
then
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
you
will
grant
,
I
hope
,
that
youth
and
discretion
are
with
respect
to
each
other
as
two
parallel
lines
,
which
though
infinitely
produced
,
remain
still
equi
-
distant
,
and
will
never
coincide
:
then
you
must
allow
that
passion
acts
upon
the
human
mind
,
in
a
ratio
compounded
of
the
acuteness
of
sense
,
and
constitutional
heat
:
and
thirdly
,
you
will
not
deny
that
the
angle
of
remorse
is
equal
to
that
of
precipitation
.
<EOS>
These
postulata
being
admitted
,
(
added
he
,
taking
paper
,
pen
and
ink
,
and
drawing
a
parallelogram
)
<EOS>
let
youth
be
represented
by
the
right
line
a%
,
b%
,
and
discretion
by
another
right
line
c%
,
d%
,
parallel
to
the
former
.
<EOS>
Compleat
the
parallelogram
a%
,
b%
,
c%
,
d%
,
and
let
the
point
of
intersection
,
b%
,
represent
perdition
.
<EOS>
Let
passion
,
represented
under
the
letter
c%
,
have
a
motion
in
the
direction
c%
,
a%
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
let
another
motion
be
communicated
to
it
,
in
the
direction
c%
,
d%
,
it
will
proceed
in
the
diagonal
c%
,
b%
,
and
describe
it
in
the
same
time
that
it
would
have
described
the
side
c%
,
a%
,
by
the
first
motion
,
or
the
side
c%
,
d%
,
by
the
second
.
<EOS>
To
understand
the
demonstration
of
this
corollary
,
we
must
premise
this
obvious
principle
,
that
when
a
body
is
acted
upon
by
a
motion
or
power
parallel
to
a
right
line
given
in
position
,
this
power
,
or
motion
,
has
no
effect
to
cause
the
body
to
approach
towards
that
line
,
or
recede
from
it
,
but
to
move
in
a
line
parallel
to
a
right
line
only
;
as
appears
from
the
second
law
of
motion
:
therefore
c%
,
a%
,
being
parallel
to
d%

b%
,

His
pupil
having
listened
to
him
thus
far
,
could
contain
himself
no
longer
,
but
interrupted
the
investigation
with
a
loud
laugh
,
and
told
him
that
his
postulata
put
him
in
mind
of
a
certain
learned
and
ingenious
gentleman
,
who
undertook
to
disprove
the
existence
of
natural
evil
,
and
asked
no
other
datum
on
which
to
found
his
demonstration
,
but
an
acknowledgment
that
every
thing
that
is
,
is
right
.
<EOS>
"
You
may
therefore
(
said
he
,
in
a
peremptory
tone
)
spare
yourself
the
trouble
of
torturing
your
invention
;
for
,
after
all
,
I
am
pretty
certain
that
I
shall
want
capacity
to
comprehend
the
discussion
of
your
lemma
,
and
consequently
be
obliged
to
refuse
my
assent
to
your
deduction
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
was
disconcerted
at
this
declaration
,
and
so
much
offended
at
Peregrine
's
disrespect
,
that
he
could
not
help
expressing
his
displeasure
,
by
telling
him
flatly
,
that
he
was
too
violent
and
headstrong
to
be
reclaimed
by
reason
and
gentle
means
;
that
he
(
the
tutor
)
must
be
obliged
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
and
conscience
,
to
inform
the
commodore
of
his
nephew
's
imprudence
;
that
if
the
laws
of
this
realm
were
effectual
,
they
would
take
cognizance
of
the
gipsy
who
had
led
him
astray
;
and
observed
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
that
if
such
a
preposterous
intrigue
had
happened
in
France
,
she
would
have
been
clapt
up
in
a
convent
two
years
ago
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
's
eyes
kindled
with
indignation
,
when
he
heard
his
mistress
treated
with
such
irreverence
;
he
could
scarce
refrain
from
inflicting
manual
chastisement
on
the
blasphemer
,
whom
he
reproached
in
his
wrath
as
an
arrogant
pedant
,
without
either
delicacy
or
sense
,
and
cautioned
him
against
using
any
such
impertinent
freedoms
with
his
affairs
for
the
future
,
on
pain
of
incurring
more
severe
effects
of
his
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
who
entertained
very
high
notions
of
that
veneration
to
which
he
thought
himself
intitled
by
his
character
and
qualifications
,
had
not
bore
without
repining
,
his
want
of
influence
and
authority
over
his
pupil
,
against
whom
he
cherished
a
particular
grudge
,
ever
since
the
adventure
of
the
painted
eye
;
and
therefore
,
on
this
occasion
,
his
politic
forbearance
had
been
overcome
by
the
accumulated
motives
of
his
disgust
.
<EOS>
Indeed
he
would
have
resigned
his
charge
with
disdain
,
had
not
he
been
encouraged
to
persevere
,
by
the
hopes
of
a
good
living
which
Trunnion
had
in
his
gift
,
or
known
how
to
dispose
of
himself
for
the
present
to
better
advantage

Chapter
XXVIII
<EOS>
He
receives
a
letter
from
his
aunt
,
breaks
with
the
commodore
,
and
disobliges
the
lieutenant
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
undertakes
his
cause
.
   
<EOS>
Mean
while
he
quitted
the
youth
in
high
dudgeon
,
and
that
same
evening
dispatched
a
letter
for
Mrs
Trunnion
,
which
was
dictated
by
the
first
transports
of
his
passion
,
and
of
course
replete
with
severe
animadversions
on
the
misconduct
of
his
pupil
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
complaint
,
it
was
not
long
before
Peregrine
received
an
epistle
from
his
aunt
,
wherein
she
commemorated
all
the
circumstances
of
the
commodore
's
benevolence
towards
him
,
when
he
was
helpless
and
forlorn
,
deserted
and
abandoned
by
his
own
parents
,
upbraided
him
for
his
misbehaviour
and
neglect
of
his
tutor
's
advice
,
and
insisted
upon
his
breaking
off
all
intercourse
with
that
girl
who
had
seduced
his
youth
,
as
he
valued
the
continuance
of
her
affection
and
her
husband
's
regard
.
    
<EOS>
As
our
lover
's
own
ideas
of
generosity
were
extremely
refined
,
he
was
shocked
at
the
indelicate
insinuations
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
and
felt
all
the
pangs
of
an
ingenuous
mind
,
that
labours
under
obligations
to
a
person
whom
it
contemns
;
<EOS>
far
from
obeying
her
injunction
,
or
humbling
himself
by
a
submissive
answer
to
her
reprehension
,
his
resentment
buoyed
him
up
above
every
selfish
consideration
;
he
resolved
to
attach
himself
to
Emilia
,
if
possible
,
more
than
ever
;
and
although
he
was
tempted
to
punish
the
officiousness
of
Jolter
,
by
recriminating
upon
his
life
and
conversation
,
he
generously
withstood
the
impulse
of
his
passion
,
because
he
knew
that
his
governor
had
no
other
dependance
than
the
good
opinion
of
the
commodore
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
,
however
,
digest
in
silence
the
severe
expostulations
of
his
aunt
;
to
which
he
replied
by
the
following
letter
,
addressed
to
her
husband
.
    
<EOS>
SIR
,
Tho
'
<EOS>
my
temper
could
never
stoop
to
offer
,
nor
,
I
believe
,
your
disposition
deign
to
receive
that
gross
incense
which
the
illiberal
only
expect
,
and
none
but
the
base
-
minded
condescend
to
pay
;
my
sentiments
have
always
done
justice
to
your
generosity
,
and
my
intention
scrupulously
adhered
to
the
dictates
of
my
duty
.
<EOS>
Conscious
of
this
integrity
of
heart
,
I
can
not
but
severely
feel
your
lady
's
unkind
(
I
will
not
call
it
ungenerous
)
recapitulation
of
the
favours
I
have
received
;
and
as
I
take
it
for
granted
,
that
you
knew
and
approved
of
her
letter
,
I
must
beg
leave
to
assure
you
,
that
far
from
being
swayed
by
menaces
and
reproach
,
I
am
determined
to
embrace
the
most
abject
extremity
of
fortune
,
rather
than
submit
to
such
dishonourable
compulsion
.
<EOS>
When
I
am
treated
in
a
more
delicate
and
respectful
manner
,
I
hope
I
shall
behave
as
becomes
,
 
<EOS>
SIR

Your
obliged
P

<EOS>
The
commodore
,
who
did
not
understand
those
nice
distinctions
of
behaviour
,
and
dreaded
the
consequence
of
Peregrine
's
amour
,
against
which
he
was
strangely
prepossessed
,
was
exasperated
at
the
insolence
and
obstinacy
of
this
adopted
son
;
to
whose
epistle
he
wrote
the
following
answer
,
which
was
transmitted
by
the
hands
of
Hatchway
,
who
had
orders
to
bring
the
delinquent
along
with
him
to
the
garison
.
    
<EOS>
"
Heark
ye
,
child
,
You
need
not
bring
your
fine
speeches
to
bear
upon
me
.
<EOS>
You
only
expend
your
ammunition
to
no
purpose

<EOS>
Your

told

nothing

truth

for
it
is
always
fair
and
honest
to
be

I
am
informed

keep
a

out

a
surer
reckoning
than
you
have
hitherto
done

I
have
sent
Jack

see
how
the

lies

warn
you
of
your
danger

if
so
be

shall
meet

yours

you
behave

<EOS>
Peregrine
was
equally
piqued
and
disconcerted
at
the
receit
of
this
letter
,
which
was
quite
different
from
what
he
had
expected
,
and
declared
in
a
resolute
tone
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
brought
it
,
that
he
might
return
as
soon
as
he
pleased
;
for
he
was
determined
to
consult
his
own
inclination
,
and
remain
for
some
time
longer
where
he
was
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
by
all
the
arguments
which
his
sagacity
and
friendship
could
supply
,
to
shew
a
little
more
deference
for
the
desire
of
the
old
man
,
who
was
by
this
time
rendered
fretful
and
peevish
by
the
gout
,
which
now
hindered
him
from
enjoying
himself
as
usual
,
and
who
might
,
in
his
passion
,
take
some
step
very
much
to
the
detriment
of
the
young
gentleman
,
whom
he
had
hitherto
considered
as
his
own
son
.
<EOS>
Among
other
remonstrances
,
Jack
observed
that
mayhap
Peregrine
had
got
under
Emilia
's
hatches
,
and
did
not
choose
to
set
her
adrift
;
and
if
that
was
the
case
,
he
himself
would
take
charge
of
the
vessel
,
and
see
her
cargo
safely
delivered
;
for
he
had
a
respect
for
the
young
woman
,
and
his
needle
pointed
towards
matrimony
;
and
as
,
in
all
probability
,
she
could
not
be
much
the
worse
for
the
wear
,
he
would
make
shift
to
scud
thro
'
life
with
her
under
an
easy
sail
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
was
deaf
to
all
his
admonitions
,
and
having
thanked
him
for
this
last
instance
of
his
complaisance
,
repeated
his
resolution
of
adhering
to
his
first
purpose
.
<EOS>
Hatchway
having
profited
so
little
by
mild
exhortations
,
assumed
a
more
peremptory
aspect
,
and
plainly
told
him
he
neither
could
nor
would
go
home
without
him
;
so
he
had
best
make
immediate
preparation
for
the
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
made
no
other
reply
to
this
declaration
than
by
a
contemptuous
smile
,
and
rose
from
his
seat
in
order
to
retire
;
upon
which
the
lieutenant
started
up
,
and
posting
himself
by
the
door
,
protested
with
some
menacing
gestures
,
that
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
run
a
-
head
neither
.
    
<EOS>
The
other
,
incensed
at
his
presumption
in
attempting
to
detain
him
by
force
,
tripped
up
his
wooden
leg
,
and
laid
him
on
his
back
in
a
moment
;
then
walked
deliberately
towards
the
park
,
in
order
to
indulge
his
reflection
,
which
at
that
time
teemed
with
disagreeable
thoughts
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
proceeded
two
hundred
steps
,
when
he
heard
something
blowing
and
stamping
behind
him
;
and
looking
back
,
perceived
the
lieutenant
at
his
heels
,
with
rage
and
indignation
in
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
This
exasperated
seaman
,
impatient
of
the
affront
he
had
received
,
and
forgetting
all
the
circumstances
of
their
former
intimacy
,
advanced
with
great
eagerness
to
his
old
friend
,
saying
,
"
Look
ye
,
brother
<EOS>
,
you
're
a
saucy
boy
,
and
if
you
was
at
sea
,
I
would
have
your
arse
brought
to
the
David
for
your
disobedience
;
but
as
we
are
on
shore
,
you
and
I
must
crack
a
pistol
at
one
another
;
here
is
a
brace
,
you
shall
take
which
you
please
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
upon
recollection
,
was
sorry
for
having
been
laid
under
the
necessity
of
disobliging
honest
Jack
,
and
very
frankly
asked
his
pardon
for
what
he
had
done
.
<EOS>
But
this
condescension
was
misinterpreted
by
the
other
,
who
refused
any
other
satisfaction
but
that
which
an
officer
ought
to
claim
;
and
,
with
some
irreverent
expressions
,
asked
if
Perry
was
afraid
of
his
bacon
.
<EOS>
The
youth
,
inflamed
at
this
unjust
insinuation
,
darted
a
ferocious
look
at
the
challenger
,
told
him
he
had
paid
but
too
much
regard
to
his
infirmities
,
and
bad
him
walk
forward
to
the
park
,
where
he
would
soon
convince
him
of
his
error
,
if
he
thought
his
concession
proceeded
from
fear
.
    
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
they
were
overtaken
by
Pipes
,
who
having
heard
the
lieutenant
's
fall
,
and
seen
him
pocket
his
pistols
,
suspected
that
there
was
a
quarrel
in
the
case
,
and
followed
him
with
a
view
of
protecting
his
master
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
seeing
him
arrive
,
and
guessing
his
intention
,
assumed
an
air
of
serenity
,
and
pretending
that
he
had
left
his
handkerchief
at
the
inn
,
ordered
his
man
to
go
thither
and
fetch
it
to
him
in
the
park
,
where
he
would
find
them
at
his
return
.
<EOS>
This
command
was
twice
repeated
before
Tom
would
take
any
other
notice
of
the
message
,
except
by
shaking
his
head
:
but
being
urged
with
many
threats
and
curses
to
obedience
,
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
knew
their
drift
too
well
to
trust
them
by
themselves
.
"
<EOS>
As
for
you
,
lieutenant
Hatchway
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
been
your
ship
-
mate
,
and
know
you
to
be
a
sailor
<EOS>
,
that
's
enough
;
and
as
for
master
,
I
know
him
to
be
<EOS>
as
good
a
man
as
ever
stept
betwixt
stem
and
stern
,
whereby
,
if
you
have
any
thing
to
say
to
him
,
I
am
your
man
,
as
the
saying
is
.
<EOS>
Here
's
my
sapling
,
and
I
do
n't
value
your
crackers
of
a
rope
's
end
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
oration
,
the
longest
that
ever
Pipes
was
known
to
make
<EOS>
,
he
concluded
with
a
flourish
of
his
cudgel
,
and
enforced
with
such
determined
refusals
to
leave
them
,
that
they
found
it
impossible
to
bring
the
cause
to
mortal
arbitrement
at
that
time
,
and
strolled
about
the
park
in
profound
silence
;
during
which
,
Hatchway
's
indignation
subsiding
,
he
all
of
a
sudden
thrust
out
his
hand
as
an
advance
to
reconciliation
,
which
being
cordially
shaken
by
Peregrine
,
a
general
pacification
ensued
;
and
was
followed
by
a
consultation
about
the
means
of
extricating
the
youth
from
his
present
perplexity
.
    
<EOS>
Had
his
disposition
been
like
that
of
most
other
young
men
,
it
would
have
been
no
difficult
task
to
overcome
his
difficulties
;
but
such
was
the
obstinacy
of
his
pride
,
that
he
deemed
himself
bound
in
honour
to
resent
the
letters
he
had
received
;
and
,
instead
of
submitting
to
the
pleasure
of
the
commodore
,
<EOS>
expected
an
acknowledgment
from
him
,
without
which
he
would
listen
to
no
terms
of
accommodation
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Had
I
been
his
own
son
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
should
have
bore
his
reproof
,
and
sued
for
forgiveness
;
but
knowing
myself
to
be
on
the
footing
of
an
orphan
who
depends
entirely
upon
his
benevolence
,
I
am
jealous
of
every
thing
that
can
be
construed
into
disrespect
,
and
insist
upon
being
treated
with
the
most
punctual
regard
.
<EOS>
I
shall
now
make
application
to
my
father
,
who
is
obliged
to
provide
for
me
by
the
ties
of
nature
,
as
well
as
the
laws
of
the
land
;
and
if
he
shall
refuse
to
do
me
justice
,
I
can
never
want
employment
while
men
are
required
for
his
majesty
's
service
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
alarmed
at
this
intimation
,
begged
he
would
take
no
new
step
,
until
he
should
hear
from
him
;
and
that
very
evening
set
out
for
the
garison
,
where
he
gave
Trunnion
an
account
of
the
miscarriage
of
his
negotiation
,
told
him
how
highly
Peregrine
was
offended
at
the
letter
,
communicated
the
young
gentleman
's
sentiments
and
resolution
;
and
finally
assured
him
,
that
unless
he
should
think
proper
to
ask
pardon
for
the
offence
he
had
committed
,
he
would
,
in
all
appearance
,
never
more
behold
the
face
of
his
godson
.
    
<EOS>
The
old
commodore
was
utterly
confounded
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
;
he
had
expected
all
the
humility
of
obedience
and
contrition
from
the
young
man
;
and
instead
of
that
,
received
nothing
but
the
most
indignant
opposition
,
and
even
found
himself
in
the
predicament
of
an
offender
,
obliged
to
make
atonement
,
or
forfeit
all
correspondence
with
his
favourite
.
<EOS>
These
insolent
conditions
at
first
threw
him
into
an
agony
of
wrath
,
and
he
vented
execrations
with
such
rapidity
,
that
he
left
himself
no
time
to
breathe
,
and
had
almost
been
suffocated
with
his
choler
.
<EOS>
He
inveighed
bitterly
against
the
ingratitude
of
Peregrine
,
whom
he
mentioned
with
many
opprobrious
epithets
,
and
swore
that
he
ought
to
be
keel
-
hauled
for
his
presumption
;
but
when
he
began
to
reflect
more
coolly
upon
the
spirit
of
the
young
gentleman
,
which
had
already
manifested
itself
on
many
occasions
,
and
listened
to
the
suggestions
of
Hatchway
,
whom
he
had
always
considered
as
an
oracle
in
his
way
,
his
resentment
abated
,
and
he
determined
to
take
Perry
into
favour
again
;
this
placability
being
not
a
little
facilitated
by
Jack
's
narrative
of
our
hero
's
intrepid
behaviour
at
the
assembly
,
as
well
as
in
the
contest
with
him
in
the
park
.
<EOS>
But
still
this
plaguy
amour
occurred
like
a
bug
-
bear
to
his
imagination
;
for
he
held
it
as
an
infallible
maxim
,
that
woman
was
an
eternal
source
of
misery
to
man
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
apothegm
he
seldom
repeated
since
his
marriage
,
except
in
the
company
of
a
very
few
intimates
,
to
whose
secrecy
and
discretion
he
could
trust
.
    
<EOS>
Finding
Jack
himself
at
a
nonplus
in
the
affair
of
Emilia
<EOS>
,
he
consulted
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
was
equally
surprised
and
offended
,
when
she
understood
that
her
letter
did
not
produce
the
desired
effect
;
and
after
having
imputed
the
youth
's
obstinacy
to
his
uncle
's
unseasonable
indulgence
,
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
the
parson
,
who
,
still
with
an
eye
to
his
friend
's
advantage
,
counselled
them
to
send
the
young
gentleman
on
his
travels
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
would
,
in
all
probability
,
forget
the
amusements
of
his
greener
years
.
<EOS>
The
proposal
was
judicious
,
and
immediately
approved
,
when
Trunnion
going
into
his
closet
,
after
divers
efforts
,
produced
the
following
billet
,
with
which
Jack
departed
for
Windsor
that
same
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
My
good
lad
<EOS>
,
If
I
gave
offence
in
my
last
letter
,
I
'm
sorry
for
it
,
d'ye
see
;
I
thought
it
was
the
likeliest
way
to
bring
you
up
;
but
,
in
time
to
come
,
you
shall
have
a
larger
swing
of
cable
.
<EOS>
When
you
can
spare
time
,
I
shall
be
glad
if
you
will
make
a
short
trip
,
and
see
your
aunt
,
and
him
who
is
 
Your
loving
godfather
,
and
humble
servant
,

Chapter
XXIX
<EOS>
He
becomes
melancholy
and
despondent
;
is
favoured
with
a
condescending
letter
from
his
uncle
,
reconciles
himself
to
his
governor
,
and
sets
out
with

<EOS>
Peregrine
,
fortified
as
he
was
with
pride
and
indignation
,
did
not
fail
to
feel
the
smarting
suggestions
of
his
present
situation
:
<EOS>
after
having
lived
so
long
in
an
affluent
and
imperious
manner
,
he
could
ill
brook
the
thoughts
of
submitting
to
the
mortifying
exigencies
of
life
;
all
the
gaudy
schemes
of
pomp
and
pleasure
,
which
his
luxuriant
imagination
had
formed
,
began
to
dissolve
;
a
train
of
melancholy
ideas
took
possession
of
his
thoughts
,
and
the
prospect
of
losing
Emilia
was
not
the
least
part
of
his
affliction
.
<EOS>
Though
he
endeavoured
to
suppress
the
chagrin
that
preyed
upon
his
heart
,
he
could
not
conceal
the
disturbance
of
his
mind
from
the
penetration
of
that
amiable
young
lady
,
who
sympathized
with
him
in
her
heart
,
though
she
could
not
give
her
tongue
the
liberty
of
asking
the
cause
of
his
disorder
;
for
,
notwithstanding
all
the
ardour
of
his
addresses
,
he
never
could
obtain
from
her
the
declaration
of
a
mutual
flame
;
because
,
tho
'
he
had
hitherto
treated
her
with
the
utmost
reverence
of
respect
<EOS>
,
he
had
never
once
mentioned
the
final
aim
of
his
passion
;
and
however
honourable
she
supposed
it
to
be
,
she
had
discernment
enough
to
foresee
,
that
vanity
or
interest
co
-
operating
with
the
levity
of
youth
,
might
one
day
deprive
her
of
her
lover
,
and
she
was
too
proud
to
give
him
any
handle
of
exulting
at
her
expence
;
so
that
,
although
he
was
received
by
her
with
the
most
distinguished
civility
,
and
even
an
intimacy
of
friendship
,
all
his
sollicitations
could
never
extort
from
her
an
acknowledgment
of
love
;
on
the
contrary
,
being
of
a
gay
disposition
,
she
sometimes
coquetted
with
other
admirers
,
that
his
attention
thus
whetted
might
never
abate
,
and
that
he
might
see
she
had
other
resources
,
in
case
he
should
flagg
in
his
affection
.
    
<EOS>
This
being
the
prudential
plan
on
which
she
acted
,
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
she
would
condescend
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
his
thoughts
,
when
she
saw
him
thus
affected
;
but
she
,
nevertheless
,
imposed
that
task
on
her
cousin
and
confidante
,
who
,
as
they
walked
together
in
the
park
,
observed
that
he
seemed
to
be
out
of
humour
.
<EOS>
When
this
is
the
case
,
such
a
question
generally
increases
the
disease
;
at
least
it
had
that
effect
upon
Peregrine
,
who
replied
somewhat
peevishly
,
<EOS>
"
I
assure
you
,
Madam
,
you
never
was
more
mistaken
in
your
observations
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
so
too
(
said
Emilia
)
for
I
never
saw
Mr
Pickle
in
higher
spirits
.
<EOS>
"
This
ironical
encomium
compleated
his
confusion
;
he
affected
to
smile
,
but
it
was
a
smile
of
anguish
,
and
in
his
heart
cursed
the
vivacity
of
both
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
for
his
soul
recollect
himself
,
so
as
to
utter
one
connected
sentence
;
and
the
suspicion
that
they
observed
every
circumstance
of
his
behaviour
,
threw
such
a
damp
on
his
spirits
,
that
he
was
quite
overwhelmed
with
shame
and
resentment
,
when
Sophy
casting
her
eyes
towards
the
gate
,
said
,
"
Yonder
is
your
servant
,
Mr
Pickle
,
with
another
man
who
seems
to
have
a
wooden
leg
.
<EOS>
"
Peregrine
started
at
this
intelligence
,
and
immediately
underwent
sundry
changes
of
complexion
,
knowing
that
his
fate
,
in
a
great
measure
,
depended
upon
the
information
he
would
receive
from
his
friend
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
advancing
to
the
company
,
after
a
brace
of
sea
-
bows
to
the
ladies
,
took
the
youth
aside
,
and
put
the
commodore
's
letter
into
his
hand
,
which
threw
him
into
such
an
agitation
,
that
he
could
scarce
pronounce
,
<EOS>
"
Ladies
,
will
you
give
me
leave
?
"
    
<EOS>
And
when
,
in
consequence
of
their
permission
,
he
attempted
to
open
the
billet
,
he
fumbled
with
such
manifest
disorder
,
that
his
mistress
,
who
watched
his
motions
,
began
to
think
there
was
something
very
interesting
in
the
message
;
and
so
much
was
she
affected
with
his
concern
,
that
she
was
fain
to
turn
her
head
another
way
,
and
wipe
the
tears
from
her
lovely
eyes
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Peregrine
no
sooner
read
the
first
sentence
,
than
his
countenance
,
which
before
was
overcast
with
a
deep
gloom
,
began
to
be
lighted
up
,
and
every
feature
unbending
by
degrees
,
he
recovered
his
serenity
;
and
having
perused
the
letter
,
his
eyes
sparkling
with
joy
and
gratitude
,
he
hugged
the
lieutenant
in
his
arms
,
and
presented
him
to
the
ladies
as
one
of
his
best
friends
.
<EOS>
Jack
met
with
a
most
gracious
reception
,
and
shook
Emilia
by
the
hand
,
telling
her
,
with
the
familiar
appellation
of
old
acquaintance
,
that
he
did
not
care
how
soon
he
was
master
of
such
another
clean
-
going
frigate
as
herself
.
    
<EOS>
The
whole
company
partook
of
this
favourable
change
that
evidently
appeared
in
our
lover
's
recollection
,
and
enlivened
his
conversation
with
such
an
uncommon
flow
of
sprightliness
and
good
humour
,
as
even
made
an
impression
on
the
iron
countenance
of
Pipes
himself
,
who
actually
smiled
with
satisfaction
as
he
walked
behind
them
.
    
<EOS>
The
evening
being
pretty
far
advanced
,
they
directed
their
course
homeward
;
and
while
the
valet
attended
Hatchway
to
the
inn
,
Peregrine
escorted
the
ladies
to
their
lodgings
,
where
he
owned
the
justness
of
Sophy
's
remark
,
in
saying
he
was
out
of
humour
,
and
told
them
he
had
been
extremely
chagrined
at
a
difference
which
happened
between
him
and
his
uncle
,
to
whom
(
by
the
letter
which
they
had
seen
him
receive
)
he
now
found
himself
happily
reconciled
.
    
<EOS>
Having
received
their
congratulations
,
and
declined
staying
to
sup
with
them
,
on
account
of
the
longing
desire
he
had
to
converse
with
his
friend
Jack
,
he
took
his
leave
,
and
repaired
to
the
inn
,
where
Hatchway
informed
him
of
every
thing
that
had
happened
in
the
garison
upon
his
representations
;
and
far
from
being
disgusted
,
he
was
perfectly
well
pleased
with
the
prospect
of
going
abroad
,
which
flattered
his
vanity
and
ambition
,
gratified
his
thirst
after
knowledge
,
and
indulged
that
turn
for
observation
,
for
which
he
had
been
remarkable
from
his
most
tender
years
:
neither
did
he
believe
a
short
absence
would
tend
to
the
prejudice
of
his
love
,
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
inhance
the
value
of
his
heart
,
because
he
should
return
better
accomplished
,
and
consequently
a
more
welcome
offering
to
his
mistress
.
<EOS>
Elevated
with
these
sentiments
,
his
heart
dilated
with
joy
,
and
the
sluices
of
his
natural
benevolence
being
opened
by
this
happy
turn
of
his
affairs
,
he
sent
his
compliments
to
Mr
Jolter
,
to
whom
he
had
not
spoken
during
a
whole
week
,
and
desired
he
would
favour
Mr
Hatchway
and
him
with
his
company
at
supper
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
was
not
weak
enough
to
decline
this
invitation
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
forthwith
appeared
,
and
was
cordially
welcomed
by
the
relenting
pupil
,
who
expressed
his
sorrow
for
the
misunderstanding
which
had
prevailed
between
them
,
and
assured
him
,
that
for
the
future
he
would
avoid
giving
him
any
just
cause
of
complaint
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
did
not
want
affections
,
was
melted
by
this
acknowledgment
,
which
he
could
not
have
expected
,
and
earnestly
protested
,
that
his
chief
study
had
always
been
,
and
ever
should
be
,
to
promote
Mr
Pickle
's
interest
and
happiness
.
    
<EOS>
The
best
part
of
the
night
being
spent
in
the
circulation
of
a
chearful
glass
,
the
company
broke
up
;
and
next
morning
Peregrine
went
out
,
with
a
view
of
making
his
mistress
acquainted
with
his
uncle
's
intention
of
sending
him
out
of
the
kingdom
for
his
improvement
,
and
of
saying
every
thing
which
he
thought
necessary
for
the
interest
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
He
found
her
at
breakfast
with
her
cousin
;
and
as
he
was
very
full
of
the
subject
of
his
visit
,
had
scarce
fixed
himself
in
his
seat
,
when
he
brought
it
upon
the
carpet
,
by
asking
with
a
smile
,
if
the
ladies
had
any
commands
for
Paris
?
<EOS>
Emilia
at
this
question
began
to
stare
,
and
her
confidante
desired
to
know
who
was
going
thither
?
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
he
himself
intended
in
a
short
time
to
visit
that
capital
,
than
his
mistress
,
with
great
precipitation
,
wished
him
a
good
journey
,
and
affected
to
talk
with
indifference
about
the
pleasures
he
would
enjoy
in
France
:
but
when
he
seriously
assured
Sophy
,
who
asked
if
he
was
in
earnest
,
that
his
uncle
actually
insisted
upon
his
making
a
short
tour
,
than
the
tears
gushed
in
poor
Emilia
's
eyes
,
and
she
was
at
great
pains
to
conceal
her
concern
,
by
observing
that
the
tea
was
so
scalding
hot
,
as
to
make
her
eyes
water
.
<EOS>
This
pretext
was
too
thin
to
impose
upon
her
lover
,
or
even
deceive
the
observation
of
her
friend
Sophy
,
who
after
breakfast
took
an
opportunity
of
quitting
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
left
by
themselves
,
Peregrine
imparted
to
her
what
he
had
learnt
of
the
commodore
's
intention
,
without
,
however
,
mentioning
a
syllable
of
his
being
offended
at
their
correspondence
;
and
accompanied
his
information
with
such
fervent
vows
of
eternal
constancy
,
and
solemn
promises
of
a
speedy
return
,
that
Emily
's
heart
,
which
had
been
invaded
by
a
suspicion
,
that
this
scheme
of
travelling
was
the
effect
of
her
lover
's
inconstancy
,
began
to
be
more
at
ease
;
and
she
could
not
help
signifying
her
approbation
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
amicably
compromised
,
he
asked
how
soon
she
proposed
to
set
out
for
her
mother
's
house
;
and
understanding
that
her
departure
was
fixed
for
next
day
but
one
,
and
that
her
cousin
Sophy
intended
to
accompany
her
in
her
father
's
chariot
,
he
repeated
his
intention
of
attending
her
,
and
in
the
mean
time
dismissed
his
governor
and
the
lieutenant
to
the
garison
,
with
his
compliments
to
his
aunt
and
the
commodore
,
and
a
faithful
promise
of
his
being
with
them
in
six
days
at
farthest
.
    
<EOS>
These
previous
measures
being
taken
,
he
,
attended
by
Pipes
,
set
out
with
the
ladies
;
and
they
had
also
a
convoy
for
twelve
miles
from
Sophy
's
father
,
who
,
at
parting
,
recommended
them
piously
to
the
care
of
Peregrine
,
with
whom
,
by
this
time
,
he
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
.

Chapter
XXX
<EOS>
They
meet
with
a
dreadful
alarm
on
the
road
,
arrive
at
their
journey
's
end
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
is
introduced
to
Emily
's
brother
;
these
two
young
gentlemen
misunderstand
each
other
.
<EOS>
Pickle
departs
for
the
garison
.
   
<EOS>
As
they
travelled
at
an
easy
rate
,
they
had
performed
something
more
than
one
half
of
their
journey
,
when
they
were
benighted
near
an
inn
,
at
which
they
resolved
to
lodge
;
the
accommodation
was
very
good
,
they
supped
together
with
great
mirth
and
enjoyment
,
and
it
was
not
till
after
he
had
been
warned
by
the
yawns
of
the
ladies
,
that
he
conducted
them
to
their
apartment
;
and
wishing
them
good
night
,
retired
to
his
own
,
and
went
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
The
house
was
crowded
with
country
people
who
had
been
at
a
neighbouring
fair
,
and
now
regaled
themselves
with
ale
and
tobacco
in
the
yard
;
so
that
their
consideration
,
which
at
any
time
was
but
slender
,
<EOS>
being
now
overwhelmed
by
this
debauch
,
they
staggered
in
to
their
respective
kennels
,
and
left
a
lighted
candle
sticking
to
one
of
the
wooden
pillars
that
supported
the
gallery
.
<EOS>
The
flame
in
a
little
time
laid
hold
on
the
wood
,
which
was
as
dry
as
tinder
,
and
the
whole
gallery
was
on
fire
,
when
Peregrine
suddenly
waked
,
and
found
himself
almost
suffocated
.
<EOS>
He
sprung
up
in
an
instant
,
slipped
on
his
breeches
,
and
throwing
open
the
door
of
his
chamber
,
saw
the
whole
entry
in
a
blaze
.
    
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
were
the
emotions
of
his
soul
,
when
he
beheld
the
volumes
of
flame
and
smoke
rolling
towards
the
room
where
his
dear
Emilia
lay
!
<EOS>
Regardless
of
his
own
danger
,
he
darted
himself
through
the
thickest
of
the
gloom
,
when
knocking
hard
,
and
calling
at
the
same
time
to
the
ladies
,
with
the
most
anxious
intreaty
to
be
admitted
;
the
door
was
opened
by
Emilia
in
her
shift
,
who
asked
with
the
utmost
trepidation
<EOS>
,
what
was
the
matter
?
<EOS>
He
made
no
reply
,
but
snatching
her
up
in
his
arms
,
like
another
Aeneas
,
bore
her
through
the
flames
to
a
place
of
safety
;
where
leaving
her
,
before
she
could
recollect
hersel
,
or
pronounce
one
word
,
but
"
Alas
!
<EOS>
my
cousin
Sophy
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
flew
back
to
the
rescue
of
that
young
lady
,
and
found
her
already
delivered
by
Pipes
,
who
having
been
alarmed
by
the
smell
of
fire
,
had
got
up
,
rushed
immediately
to
the
chamber
where
he
knew
these
companions
lodged
,
and
(
Emily
being
saved
by
her
lover
)
<EOS>
brought
off
Miss
Sophy
,
with
the
loss
of
his
own
shockhead
of
hair
,
which
was
singed
off
in
his
retreat
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
whole
inn
was
alarmed
,
every
lodger
,
as
well
as
servant
,
exerted
himself
,
in
order
to
stop
the
progress
of
this
calamity
;
and
there
being
a
well
replenished
horsepond
in
the
yard
,
in
less
than
an
hour
<EOS>
the
fire
was
totally
extinguished
,
without
having
done
any
other
damage
than
that
of
consuming
about
two
yards
of
the
wooden
gallery
.
    
<EOS>
All
this
time
our
young
gentleman
closely
attended
his
fair
charge
,
each
of
whom
had
swooned
with
apprehension
;
but
as
their
constitutions
were
good
,
and
their
spirits
not
easily
dissipated
,
when
upon
reflection
they
found
themselves
and
their
company
safe
,
and
that
the
flames
were
happily
quenched
,
the
tumult
of
their
fears
subsided
,
they
put
on
their
cloaths
,
recovered
their
good
humour
,
and
began
to
rally
each
other
on
the
trim
in
which
they
had
been
secured
.
<EOS>
Sophy
observed
,
that
now
Mr
Pickle
had
an
indisputable
claim
to
her
cousin
's
affection
;
and
therefore
she
ought
to
lay
aside
all
affected
reserve
for
the
future
,
and
frankly
avow
the
sentiments
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Emily
retorted
the
argument
,
putting
her
in
mind
,
that
by
the
same
claim
Mr
Pipes
was
intitled
to
the
like
return
from
her
.
<EOS>
Her
friend
admitted
the
force
of
the
conclusion
,
provided
she
could
not
find
means
of
satisfying
her
deliverer
in
another
shape
;
and
turning
to
the
valet
,
who
happened
to
be
present
,
asked
if
his
heart
was
not
otherwise
engaged
?
<EOS>
Tom
,
who
did
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
the
question
,
stood
silent
according
to
custom
;
and
the
interrogation
being
repeated
,
answered
with
a
grin
,
"
Heart
-
whole
as
a
biscuit
,
I
'll
assure
you
,
Mistress
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
(
said
Emilia
)
<EOS>
have
you
never
been
in
love
,
Thomas
?
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
forfooth
,
(
replied
the
valet
,
without
hesitation
)
sometimes
of
a
morning
.
<EOS>
"
Peregrine
could
not
help
laughing
,
and
his
mistress
looked
a
little
disconcerted
at
this
blunt
repartee
;
while
Sophy
,
slipping
a
purse
into
his
hand
,
told
him
there
was
something
to
purchase
a
periwig
.
<EOS>
Tom
having
consulted
his
master
's
eyes
,
refused
the
present
,
saying
,
"
No
,
thank
ye
as
much
as
if
I
did
.
"
<EOS>
And
though
she
insisted
upon
his
putting
it
in
his
pocket
,
as
a
small
testimony
of
her
gratitude
,
he
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
avail
himself
of
her
generosity
;
but
following
her
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
thrust
it
into
her
sleeve
without
ceremony
,
exclaiming
,
"
I
'll
be
damned
to
hell
if
I
do
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
checked
him
for
his
boorish
behaviour
,
sent
him
out
of
the
room
,
and
begged
that
Miss
Sophy
would
not
endeavour
to
debauch
the
morals
of
his
servant
,
who
rough
and
uncultivated
as
he
was
,
had
sense
enough
to
perceive
that
he
had
no
pretension
to
any
such
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
But
she
argued
with
great
vehemence
,
that
she
should
never
be
able
to
make
an
acknowledgment
adequate
to
the
service
he
had
done
her
,
and
that
she
should
never
be
perfectly
easy
in
her
own
mind
,
until
she
found
some
opportunity
of
manifesting
the
sense
she
had
of
the
obligation
:
"
I
do
not
pretend
(
said
she
)
to
reward
Mr
Pipes
;
but
I
shall
be
absolutely
unhappy
,
unless
I
am
allowed
to
give
him
some
token
of
my
regard
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
thus
earnestly
sollicited
,
desired
that
since
she
was
bent
upon
displaying
her
generosity
,
she
would
not
bestow
upon
him
any
pecuniary
gratification
,
but
honour
him
with
some
trinket
,
as
a
mark
of
consideration
;
because
he
himself
had
such
a
particular
value
for
the
fellow
,
on
account
of
his
attachment
and
fidelity
,
that
he
should
be
sorry
to
see
him
treated
on
the
footing
of
a
common
mercenary
domestick
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
not
one
jewel
in
the
possession
of
this
grateful
young
lady
,
that
she
would
not
have
gladly
given
as
a
recompence
,
or
badge
of
distinction
,
to
her
rescuer
:
but
his
master
pitched
upon
a
seal
ring
of
no
great
value
that
hung
at
her
watch
;
and
Pipes
being
called
in
,
had
permission
to
accept
that
testimony
of
Miss
Sophy
's
favour
.
<EOS>
Tom
received
it
accordingly
with
sundry
scrapes
,
and
having
kissed
it
with
great
devotion
,
put
it
on
his
little
finger
,
and
strutted
off
,
extremely
proud
of
his
acquisition
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
with
a
most
enchanting
sweetness
of
aspect
,
told
her
lover
,
that
he
had
instructed
her
how
to
behave
towards
him
;
and
taking
a
diamond
ring
from
her
finger
,
desired
he
would
wear
it
for
her
sake
.
<EOS>
He
received
the
pledge
as
became
him
,
and
presented
another
in
exchange
,
which
she
at
first
refused
,
alledging
that
it
would
destroy
the
intent
of
her
acknowledgment
;
but
Peregrine
assured
her
,
he
had
accepted
her
jewel
,
not
as
a
proof
of
her
gratitude
,
but
as
the
mark
of
her
love
;
and
that
if
she
refused
a
mutual
token
,
he
should
look
upon
himself
as
the
object
of
her
disdain
.
<EOS>
Her
eyes
kindled
,
and
her
cheeks
glowed
with
resentment
at
this
impudent
intimation
,
which
she
considered
as
an
unseasonable
insult
;
and
the
young
gentleman
perceiving
her
emotion
,
stood
corrected
for
his
temerity
,
and
asked
pardon
for
the
liberty
of
his
remonstrance
,
which
he
hoped
she
would
ascribe
to
the
prevalence
of
that
principle
alone
,
which
he
had
always
taken
pride
in
avowing
.
    
<EOS>
Sophy
seeing
him
disconcerted
,
interposed
in
his
behalf
,
and
chid
her
cousin
for
having
practised
such
unnecessary
affectation
;
upon
which
Emilia
,
softened
into
compliance
,
held
out
her
finger
as
a
signal
of
her
condescension
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
put
on
the
ring
with
great
eagerness
,
mumbled
her
soft
white
hand
in
an
extasy
,
which
would
not
allow
him
to
confine
his
embraces
to
that
limb
,
but
urged
him
to
seize
her
by
the
waist
,
and
snatch
a
delicious
kiss
from
her
love
-
pouting
lips
;
nor
would
he
leave
her
a
butt
to
the
ridicule
of
Sophy
,
on
whose
mouth
he
instantly
committed
a
rape
of
the
same
nature
;
so
that
the
two
friends
,
countenanced
by
each
other
,
reprehended
him
with
such
gentleness
of
rebuke
,
that
he
was
almost
tempted
to
repeat
the
offence
.
    
<EOS>
The
morning
being
now
lighted
up
,
and
the
servants
of
the
inn
on
foot
,
he
ordered
some
chocolate
for
breakfast
,
and
at
the
desire
of
the
ladies
sent
Pipes
to
see
the
horses
fed
,
and
the
chariot
prepared
,
while
he
went
to
the
bar
,
and
discharged
the
bill
.
    
<EOS>
These
measures
being
taken
,
they
set
out
about
five
o'clock
,
and
having
refreshed
themselves
and
their
cattle
at
another
inn
on
the
road
,
during
the
heat
of
the
day
,
they
proceeded
in
the
afternoon
;
and
,
without
meeting
with
any
other
accident
,
safely
arrived
at
the
place
of
their
destination
,
where
Mrs
Gauntlet
expressed
her
joy
at
seeing
her
old
friend
Mr
Pickle
,
whom
,
however
,
she
kindly
reproached
for
the
long
discontinuance
of
his
regard
.
<EOS>
Without
explaining
the
cause
of
that
interruption
,
he
protested
that
his
love
and
esteem
had
never
been
discontinued
,
and
that
for
the
future
he
should
omit
no
occasion
of
testifying
how
much
he
had
her
friendship
at
heart
.
<EOS>
She
then
made
him
acquainted
with
her
son
,
who
at
that
time
was
in
the
house
,
being
excused
from
his
duty
by
furlow
.
    
<EOS>
This
young
man
,
whose
name
was
Godfrey
,
was
about
the
age
of
twenty
,
of
a
middling
size
,
vigorous
make
,
remarkably
well
shaped
,
and
the
scars
of
the
small
pox
,
of
which
he
bore
a
good
number
,
added
a
peculiar
manliness
to
the
air
of
his
countenance
.
<EOS>
His
capacity
was
good
,
and
his
disposition
naturally
frank
and
easy
;
but
he
had
been
a
soldier
from
his
infancy
,
and
his
education
was
altogether
in
the
military
stile
.
    
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
taste
and
letters
as
meer
pedantry
,
beneath
the
consideration
of
a
gentleman
,
and
every
civil
station
of
life
as
mean
,
when
compared
with
the
profession
of
arms
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
great
progress
in
the
gymnastic
sciences
of
dancing
,
fencing
and
riding
,
played
perfectly
well
on
the
German
flute
,
and
above
all
things
valued
himself
upon
a
scrupulous
observance
of
all
the
points
of
honour
.
    
<EOS>
Had
Peregrine
<EOS>
and
he
considered
themselves
upon
equal
footing
,
in
all
probability
they
would
have
immediately
entered
into
a
league
of
intimacy
and
friendship
;
but
this
sufficient
soldier
looked
upon
his
sister
's
admirer
as
a
young
student
raw
from
the
university
,
and
utterly
ignorant
of
mankind
,
while
squire
Pickle
beheld
Godfrey
in
the
light
of
a
needy
volunteer
,
greatly
inferior
to
himself
in
fortune
,
as
well
as
every
other
accomplishment
.
<EOS>
This
mutual
misunderstanding
could
not
fail
of
producing
animosities
.
<EOS>
The
very
next
day
after
Peregrine
's
arrival
,
some
sharp
repartees
passed
between
them
in
presence
of
the
ladies
,
before
whom
each
endeavoured
to
assert
his
own
superiority
.
<EOS>
In
these
contests
our
hero
never
failed
of
obtaining
the
victory
,
because
his
genius
was
more
acute
,
and
his
talents
better
cultivated
than
those
of
his
antagonist
,
who
therefore
took
umbrage
at
his
success
,
became
jealous
of
his
reputation
,
and
began
to
treat
him
with
marks
of
scorn
and
disrespect
.
    
<EOS>
His
sister
saw
,
and
dreading
the
consequence
of
his
ferocity
,
not
only
took
him
to
talk
in
private
for
his
impolite
behaviour
,
but
also
intreated
her
lover
to
make
allowances
for
the
roughness
of
her
brother
's
education
.
    
<EOS>
He
kindly
assured
her
,
that
whatever
pains
it
might
cost
him
to
vanquish
his
own
impetuous
temper
,
he
would
for
her
sake
endure
all
the
mortifications
to
which
her
brother
's
arrogance
might
expose
him
;
and
after
having
stayed
with
her
two
days
,
and
enjoyed
several
private
interviews
,
during
which
he
acted
the
part
of
a
most
passionate
lover
,
he
took
his
leave
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
over
-
night
,
and
told
the
young
ladies
he
would
call
early
next
morning
,
to
bid
them
farewel
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
neglect
this
piece
of
duty
,
and
found
the
two
friends
and
breakfast
already
prepared
in
the
parlour
.
<EOS>
All
three
being
extremely
affected
with
the
thoughts
of
parting
,
a
most
pathetic
silence
for
some
time
prevailed
,
till
Peregrine
put
an
end
to
it
,
by
lamenting
his
fate
,
in
being
obliged
to
exile
himself
so
long
from
the
dear
object
of
his
most
interesting
wish
;
and
begged
with
the
most
earnest
supplications
,
that
she
would
now
,
in
consideration
of
the
cruel
absence
he
must
suffer
,
give
him
the
consolation
which
she
had
hitherto
refused
,
namely
,
that
of
knowing
he
possessed
a
place
within
her
heart
.
<EOS>
The
confidante
seconded
his
request
,
representing
that
it
was
now
no
time
to
disguise
her
sentiments
,
when
her
lover
was
about
to
leave
the
kingdom
,
and
might
be
in
danger
of
contracting
other
connexions
,
unless
he
was
confirmed
in
his
constancy
,
by
knowing
how
far
he
could
depend
upon
her
love
;
and
in
short
,
she
was
plied
with
such
irresistible
importunities
,
that
she
answered
in
the
utmost
confusion
,
"
Tho
'
<EOS>
I
have
avoided
literal
acknowledgments
,
methinks
the
circumstances
of
my
behavior
might
have
convinced
Mr
Pickle
,
that
I
do
not
regard
him
as
a
common
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
My
charming
Emily
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
impatient
lover
,
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
)
<EOS>
why
will
you
deal
out
my
happiness
in
such
scanty
portions
?
<EOS>
Why
will
you
thus
mince
the
declaration
which
would
overwhelm
me
with
pleasure
,
and
chear
my
lonely
reflection
,
while
I
sigh
amid
the
solitude
of
separation
?
"
<EOS>
His
fair
mistress
,
melted
by
this
image
,
replied
,
with
the
tears
gushing
from
her
eyes
,
"
I
'm
afraid
I
shall
feel
that
separation
more
severely
than
you
imagine
<EOS>
"
Transported
at
this
flattering
confession
,
he
pressed
her
to
his
breast
,
and
while
her
head
reclined
upon
his
neck
,
mingled
his
tears
with
hers
in
great
abundance
,
and
breathed
the
most
tender
vows
of
eternal
fidelity
.
<EOS>
The
gentle
heart
of
Sophy
could
not
bear
this
scene
unmoved
,
she
wept
with
sympathy
,
and
encouraged
the
lovers
to
resign
themselves
to
the
will
of
fate
,
and
support
their
spirits
with
the
hope
of
meeting
again
on
happier
terms
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
after
mutual
promises
,
exhortations
and
endearments
,
Peregrine
took
his
leave
,
his
heart
being
so
full
,
that
he
could
scarce
pronounce
the
word
"
Adieu
!
"
<EOS>
and
mounting
his
horse
at
the
door
,
set
out
with
Pipes
for
the
garison
.

Chapter
XXXI
   
<EOS>
In
order
to
expel
the
melancholy
images
that
took
possession
of
his
fancy
,
at
parting
from
his
mistress
,
he
called
in
the
flattering
ideas
of
those
pleasures
he
expected
to
enjoy
in
France
;
and
before
he
had
rode
ten
miles
,
his
imagination
was
effectually
amused
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
prosecuted
his
travels
by
anticipation
,
and
indulged
himself
in
all
the
insolence
of
hope
,
at
the
turning
of
a
lane
he
was
all
of
a
sudden
overtaken
by
Emilia
's
brother
on
horseback
,
who
told
him
he
was
riding
the
same
way
,
and
should
be
glad
of
his
company
.
    
<EOS>
This
young
gentleman
,
whether
prompted
by
personal
pique
,
or
actuated
with
zeal
for
the
honour
of
his
family
,
had
followed
our
hero
,
with
a
view
of
obliging
him
to
explain
the
nature
of
his
attachment
to
his
sister
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
returned
his
compliment
with
such
disdainful
civility
,
as
gave
him
room
to
believe
that
he
suspected
his
errand
;
and
therefore
,
without
further
preamble
,
he
declared
his
business
in
these
words
:
"
Mr
Pickle
,
you
have
carried
on
a
correspondence
with
my
sister
for
some
time
,
and
I
should
be
glad
to
know
the
nature
of
it
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
To
this
question
our
lover
replied
,
"
Sir
,
I
should
be
glad
to
know
what
title
you
have
to
demand
that
satisfaction
?
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
answered
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
demand
it
in
the
capacity
of
a
brother
,
jealous
of
his
own
honour
,
as
well
as
of
his
sister
's
reputation
;
and
if
your
intentions
are
honourable
,
you
will
not
refuse
it
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
said
Peregrine
)
<EOS>
I
am
not
at
present
disposed
to
appeal
to
your
opinion
for
the
rectitude
of
my
intentions
;
and
I
think
you
assume
a
little
too
much
importance
,
in
pretending
to
judge
my
conduct
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
replied
the
soldier
)
<EOS>
I
pretend
to
judge
the
conduct
of
every
man
who
interferes
with
my
concerns
,
and
even
to
chastise
him
,
if
I
think
he
acts
amiss
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
Chastise
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
youth
,
with
indignation
in
his
looks
)
<EOS>
sure
you
dare
not
apply
that
term
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
mistaken
(
said
Godfrey
)
<EOS>
I
dare
do
any
thing
that
becomes
the
character
of
a
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
"
Gentleman
,
God
wot
!
<EOS>
(
replied
the
other
,
looking
contemptuously
at
his
equipage
,
which
was
none
of
the
most
superb
)
a
very
pretty
gentleman
,
truly
!
"
<EOS>
The
soldier
's
wrath
was
inflamed
by
this
ironical
repetition
,
the
contempt
of
which
his
conscious
poverty
made
him
feel
;
and
he
called
his
antagonist
presumptuous
boy
,
insolent
upstart
,
with
other
epithets
,
which
Perry
retorted
with
great
bitterness
:
and
a
formal
challenge
having
passed
between
them
,
they
alighted
at
the
first
inn
,
and
walked
into
the
next
field
,
in
order
to
decide
their
quarrel
by
the
sword
.
<EOS>
Having
pitched
upon
the
spot
,
helped
to
pull
off
each
other
's
boots
,
and
laid
aside
their
coats
and
waistcoats
,
Mr
Gauntlet
told
his
opponent
,
that
he
himself
was
looked
upon
in
the
army
as
an
expert
swordsman
,
and
that
if
Mr
Pickle
had
not
made
that
science
his
particular
study
,
they
should
be
upon
a
more
equal
footing
in
using
pistols
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
too
much
incensed
to
thank
him
for
his
plain
dealing
,
and
too
confident
of
his
own
skill
to
relish
the
other
's
proposal
,
which
he
accordingly
rejected
;
and
drawing
his
sword
,
observed
,
<EOS>
that
were
he
to
treat
Mr
Gauntlet
according
to
his
deserts
,
he
would
order
his
man
to
punish
his
audacity
with
an
horse
-
whip
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
at
this
expression
,
which
he
considered
as
an
indelible
affront
,
he
made
no
reply
,
but
attacked
his
adversary
with
equal
ferocity
and
address
.
<EOS>
The
youth
parried
his
first
and
second
thrust
,
but
received
the
third
in
the
outside
of
his
sword
-
arm
.
    
<EOS>
Though
the
wound
was
superficial
,
he
was
transported
with
rage
at
sight
of
his
own
blood
,
and
returned
the
assault
with
such
fury
and
precipitation
,
that
Gauntlet
,
loath
to
take
advantage
of
his
unguarded
heat
,
stood
upon
the
defensive
;
and
in
the
second
longe
,
Peregrine
's
weapon
entering
a
kind
of
net
work
in
the
shell
of
Godfrey
's
sword
,
the
blade
snapped
in
two
,
and
left
him
at
the
mercy
of
the
soldier
,
who
,
far
from
making
an
insolent
use
of
the
victory
he
had
gained
,
put
up
his
Toledo
with
great
deliberation
,
like
a
man
who
had
been
used
to
that
kind
of
rencounters
,
observed
that
such
a
blade
as
Peregrine
's
was
not
to
be
trusted
with
a
man
's
life
,
and
advising
the
owner
to
treat
a
gentleman
in
distress
with
more
respect
for
the
future
,
slipped
on
his
boots
,
and
with
sullen
dignity
of
demeanour
stalked
back
to
the
inn
.
    
<EOS>
Though
Pickle
was
extremely
mortified
at
his
miscarriage
in
this
adventure
,
he
was
also
struck
with
the
behaviour
of
his
antagonist
,
which
affected
him
the
more
,
as
he
understood
that
Godfrey
's
fiert
had
proceeded
from
the
jealous
sensibility
of
a
gentleman
declined
into
the
vale
of
misfortune
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
's
valour
and
moderation
induced
him
to
put
a
favourable
construction
on
all
those
circumstances
of
that
young
soldier
's
conduct
,
which
before
had
given
him
disgust
;
and
though
in
any
other
case
he
would
have
industriously
avoided
the
least
appearance
of
submission
,
he
followed
his
conqueror
to
the
inn
,
with
a
view
of
thanking
him
for
his
generous
forbearance
,
and
of
solliciting
his
friendship
and
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
had
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
to
mount
,
when
Peregrine
coming
up
to
him
,
desired
he
would
defer
his
departure
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
favour
him
with
a
little
private
conversation
.
<EOS>
The
soldier
,
who
mistook
the
meaning
of
the
request
,
immediately
quitted
his
horse
,
and
followed
Pickle
into
a
chamber
,
where
he
expected
to
find
a
brace
of
pistols
loaded
on
the
table
;
but
he
was
very
agreeably
deceived
,
when
our
hero
,
in
the
most
respectful
terms
,
acknowledged
his
noble
deportment
in
the
field
,
owned
that
till
then
he
had
misunderstood
his
character
,
and
begged
that
he
would
honour
him
with
his
intimacy
and
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
had
seen
undoubted
proofs
of
Peregrine
's
courage
,
which
had
considerably
raised
him
in
his
esteem
,
and
had
sense
enough
to
perceive
that
this
concession
was
not
owing
to
any
sordid
or
sinister
motive
,
embraced
his
offer
with
demonstrations
of
infinite
satisfaction
;
and
when
he
understood
the
terms
on
which
Mr
Pickle
was
with
his
sister
,
proffered
his
service
in
his
turn
,
either
as
agent
,
mediator
,
or
confidant
:
<EOS>
nay
,
to
give
this
new
friend
a
convincing
proof
of
his
sincerity
,
he
disclosed
to
him
a
passion
which
he
had
for
some
time
entertained
for
his
cousin
Miss
Sophy
,
though
he
durst
not
reveal
his
sentiments
to
her
father
,
lest
he
should
be
offended
at
his
presumption
,
and
withdraw
his
protection
from
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
generous
heart
was
wrung
with
anguish
,
when
he
understood
that
this
young
gentleman
,
who
was
the
only
son
of
a
distinguished
officer
,
had
carried
arms
for
the
space
of
five
years
,
without
being
able
to
obtain
a
subaltern
's
commission
,
though
he
had
always
behaved
with
remarkable
regularity
and
spirit
,
and
acquired
the
friendship
and
esteem
of
all
the
officers
under
whom
he
had
served
.
    
<EOS>
He
would
,
at
that
time
,
with
the
utmost
pleasure
,
have
shared
his
finances
with
him
;
but
as
he
would
not
run
the
risk
of
offending
the
young
soldier
's
delicacy
of
honour
,
by
a
premature
exertion
of
his
liberality
,
he
resolved
to
insinuate
himself
into
an
intimacy
with
him
,
before
he
would
venture
to
take
such
freedoms
;
and
with
that
view
pressed
Mr
Gauntlet
to
accompany
him
to
the
garison
,
where
he
did
not
doubt
of
having
influence
enough
to
make
him
a
welcome
guest
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
thanked
him
very
courteously
for
his
invitation
,
which
he
said
he
could
not
immediately
accept
,
but
promised
if
he
would
favour
him
with
a
letter
,
and
fix
the
time
at
which
he
proposed
to
set
out
for
France
,
he
would
endeavour
to
visit
him
at
the
commodore
's
habitation
,
and
from
thence
give
him
a
convoy
to
Dover
.
<EOS>
This
new
treaty
being
settled
,
and
a
dossil
of
lint
with
a
snip
of
plaister
applied
to
our
adventurer
's
wound
,
he
parted
from
the
brother
of
his
dear
Emilia
,
to
whom
and
his
friend
Sophy
<EOS>
he
sent
his
kindest
wishes
;
and
having
lodged
one
night
upon
the
road
,
arrived
next
day
in
the
afternoon
at
the
garison
,
where
he
found
all
his
friends
in
good
health
,
and
overjoyed
at
his
return
.
    
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
who
was
by
this
time
turned
of
seventy
,
and
altogether
crippled
by
the
gout
,
seldom
went
abroad
;
and
as
his
conversation
was
not
very
entertaining
,
had
but
little
company
within
doors
;
so
that
his
spirits
must
have
quite
stagnated
,
had
not
they
been
kept
in
motion
by
the
conversation
of
Hatchway
,
and
received
at
different
times
an
wholesome
fillip
from
the
discipline
of
his
spouse
,
who
,
by
the
force
of
pride
,
religion
and
Coniac
,
had
erected
a
most
terrible
tyranny
in
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
such
a
quick
circulation
of
domesticks
in
the
family
,
that
every
suit
of
livery
had
been
worn
by
figures
of
all
dimensions
:
<EOS>
Trunnion
himself
had
long
before
this
time
yielded
to
the
torrent
of
her
arbitrary
sway
;
though
not
without
divers
obstinate
efforts
to
maintain
his
liberty
;
and
now
,
that
he
was
disabled
by
his
iufirmities
,
when
he
used
to
hear
his
empress
singing
the
loud
Orthyan
song
among
the
servants
below
,
he
would
often
in
whispers
communicate
to
the
lieutenant
,
<EOS>
hints
of
what
he
would
do
if
so
be
he
was
not
deprived
of
the
use
of
his
precious
limbs
.
<EOS>
Hatchway
was
the
only
person
whom
the
temper
of
Mrs
Trunnion
respected
,
either
because
she
dreaded
his
ridicule
,
or
looked
upon
his
person
with
the
eyes
of
affection
.
<EOS>
This
being
the
situation
of
things
in
the
garison
,
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
the
old
gentleman
highly
enjoyed
the
presence
of
Peregrine
,
who
found
means
to
ingratiate
himself
so
effectually
with
his
aunt
,
that
while
he
remained
at
home
,
she
seemed
to
have
exchanged
the
disposition
of
a
tygress
,
for
that
of
a
gentle
kid
;
but
he
found
his
own
mother
as
implacable
,
and
his
father
as
much
hen
-
pecked
as
ever
.
    
<EOS>
Gamaliel
,
who
now
very
seldom
enjoyed
the
conversation
of
his
old
friend
the
commodore
,
had
some
time
ago
entered
into
an
amicable
society
,
consisting
of
the
barber
,
apothecary
,
attorney
and
exciseman
of
the
parish
,
among
whom
he
used
to
spend
the
evening
at
Tunley
's
,
and
listen
to
their
disputes
upon
philosophy
and
politicks
,
with
great
comfort
and
edification
,
while
his
sovereign
lady
domineered
at
home
as
usual
,
visited
with
great
pomp
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
employed
her
chief
care
in
the
education
of
her
darling
son
Gam
,
who
was
now
in
the
fifteenth
year
of
his
age
,
and
so
remarkable
for
his
perverse
disposition
,
that
in
spite
of
his
mother
's
influence
and
authority
,
he
was
not
only
hated
,
but
also
despised
both
at
home
and
abroad
.
<EOS>
She
had
put
him
under
the
tuition
of
the
curate
who
lived
in
the
family
,
and
was
obliged
to
attend
him
in
all
his
exercises
and
excursions
.
<EOS>
This
governor
was
a
low
bred
fellow
,
who
had
neither
experience
nor
ingenuity
,
but
possessed
a
large
fund
of
adulation
and
servile
complaisance
,
by
which
he
had
gained
the
good
graces
of
Mrs
Pickle
,
and
presided
over
all
her
deliberations
in
the
same
manner
as
his
superior
managed
those
of
Mrs
Trunnion
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
one
day
rode
out
to
take
the
air
with
his
pupil
,
who
,
as
I
have
already
observed
,
was
odious
to
the
poor
people
,
for
having
killed
their
dogs
and
broken
their
inclosures
,
and
on
account
of
his
hump
,
distinguished
by
the
title
of
my
lord
;
when
in
a
narrow
lane
they
chanced
to
meet
Peregrine
on
horseback
.
    
<EOS>
The
young
squire
no
sooner
perceived
his
elder
brother
,
for
whom
he
had
been
instructed
to
entertain
the
most
inveterate
grudge
,
than
he
resolved
to
insult
him
en
passant
,
and
actually
rode
against
him
full
gallop
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
guessing
his
aim
,
fixed
himself
in
his
stirrups
,
and
by
a
dexterous
management
of
the
reins
,
avoided
the
shock
in
such
a
manner
,
as
that
their
legs
only
should
encounter
,
by
which
means
my
lord
was
tilted
out
of
his
saddle
,
and
in
a
twinkling
laid
sprawling
in
the
dirt
.
<EOS>
The
governor
enraged
at
the
disgrace
of
his
charge
,
advanced
with
great
insolence
and
fury
,
and
struck
at
Peregrine
with
his
whip
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
our
young
gentleman
than
this
assault
,
which
furnished
him
with
an
opportunity
of
chastising
an
officious
wretch
,
whose
petulance
and
malice
he
had
longed
to
punish
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
spurring
up
his
horse
towards
his
antagonist
,
overthrew
him
in
the
middle
of
a
hedge
;
and
before
he
had
time
to
recollect
himself
from
the
confusion
of
the
fall
,
alighted
in
a
trice
,
and
exercised
his
horse
-
whip
with
such
agility
about
the
curate
's
face
and
ears
,
that
he
was
fain
to
prostrate
himself
before
his
enraged
conqueror
,
and
implore
his
forbearance
in
the
most
abject
terms
.
<EOS>
While
Peregrine
was
thus
employed
,
his
brother
Gam
had
made
shift
to
rise
,
and
attack
him
in
the
rear
;
for
which
reason
,
when
the
tutor
was
quelled
,
the
victor
faced
about
,
snatched
the
weapon
out
of
his
hand
,
and
having
broken
it
to
pieces
,
remounted
his
horse
,
and
rode
off
,
without
deigning
to
honour
him
with
any
other
notice
.
    
<EOS>
The
condition
in
which
they
returned
produced
infinite
clamour
against
the
conqueror
,
who
was
represented
as
a
ruffian
who
had
lain
in
ambush
to
make
away
with
his
brother
,
in
whose
defence
the
curate
was
said
to
have
received
those
cruel
stripes
,
that
hindered
him
from
appearing
for
three
whole
weeks
in
the
performance
of
his
duty
at
church
.
    
<EOS>
Complaints
were
made
to
the
commodore
,
who
having
inquired
into
the
circumstances
of
the
affair
,
approved
of
what
his
nephew
had
done
;
adding
,
with
many
oaths
,
that
,
provided
Peregrine
had
been
out
of
the
scrape
,
he
wished
Crookback
had
broke
his
neck
in
the
fall
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXXII
He
projects
a
plan
of
revenge
,
which
is
executed
against
the
curate
.
   
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
exasperated
at
the
villainy
of
the
curate
,
in
the
treacherous
misrepresentation
he
had
made
of
this
rencounter
,
determined
to
practise
upon
him
a
method
of
revenge
,
which
should
be
not
only
effectual
,
but
also
unattended
with
any
bad
consequence
to
himself
.
<EOS>
For
this
purpose
he
and
Hatchway
,
to
whom
he
imparted
his
plan
,
went
to
the
alehouse
one
evening
,
and
called
for
an
empty
room
,
knowing
there
was
no
other
but
that
which
they
had
chosen
for
the
scene
of
action
.
    
<EOS>
This
apartment
was
a
sort
of
a
parlour
that
fronted
the
kitchen
,
with
a
window
towards
the
yard
;
where
,
after
they
had
sat
some
time
,
the
lieutenant
found
means
to
amuse
the
landlord
in
discourse
,
while
Peregrine
stepping
out
into
the
yard
,
by
the
talent
of
mimickry
,
which
he
possessed
in
a
surprising
degree
,
counterfeited
a
dialogue
beteen
the
curate
and
Tunley
's
wife
;
which
reaching
the
ears
of
the
publican
,
for
whose
hearing
it
was
calculated
,
inflamed
his
naturally
jealous
disposition
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
not
conceal
his
emotion
,
but
made
an
hundred
efforts
to
quit
the
room
;
while
the
lieutenant
,
smoaking
his
pipe
with
great
gravity
,
as
if
he
neither
heard
what
passed
,
nor
took
notice
of
the
landlord
's
disorder
,
detained
him
on
the
spot
by
a
succession
of
questions
which
he
could
not
refuse
to
answer
;
though
he
stood
sweating
with
agony
all
the
time
,
stretching
his
neck
every
instant
towards
the
window
thro
'
which
the
voices
were
conveyed
,
scratching
his
head
,
and
exhibiting
sundry
other
symptoms
of
impatience
and
agitation
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
the
supposed
conversation
came
to
such
a
pitch
of
amorous
complaisance
,
that
the
husband
,
quite
frantic
with
his
imaginary
disgrace
,
rushed
out
at
the
door
,
crying
,
"
Coming
,
Sir
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
he
was
obliged
to
make
a
circuit
round
one
half
of
the
house
,
Peregrine
had
got
in
by
the
window
,
before
Tunley
arrived
in
the
yard
.
    
<EOS>
According
to
the
feigned
intelligence
he
had
received
,
he
ran
directly
to
the
barn
,
in
expectation
of
making
some
very
extraordinary
discovery
;
and
having
employed
some
minutes
in
rummaging
the
straw
to
no
purpose
,
returned
in
a
state
of
distraction
to
the
kitchen
,
just
as
his
wife
chanced
to
enter
at
the
other
door
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
of
her
appearance
confirmed
him
in
the
opinion
,
that
the
deed
was
done
;
but
as
the
disease
of
being
hen
-
peck'd
was
epidemic
in
the
parish
,
he
durst
not
express
the
least
hint
of
his
uneasiness
to
her
,
but
resolved
to
take
vengeance
on
the
libidinous
priest
,
who
,
he
imagined
,
had
corrupted
the
chastity
of
his
spouse
.
    
<EOS>
The
two
confederates
,
in
order
to
be
certified
that
their
scheme
had
taken
effect
,
as
well
as
to
blow
up
the
flame
which
they
had
kindled
,
called
for
Tunley
,
in
whose
countenance
they
could
easily
discern
his
confusion
;
and
Peregrine
desiring
him
to
sit
down
and
drink
a
glass
with
them
,
began
to
interrogate
him
about
his
family
,
and
among
other
things
,
asked
him
how
long
he
had
been
married
to
that
handsome
wife
?
    
<EOS>
This
question
,
which
was
put
with
an
arch
significance
of
look
,
alarmed
the
publican
,
who
began
to
fear
that
Pickle
had
overheard
his
dishonour
;
and
this
suspicion
was
not
at
all
removed
,
when
the
lieutenant
,
with
a
sly
regard
,
pronounced
,
"
Tunley
,
wan't
you
noosed
by
the
curate
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
was
,
"
(
replied
the
landlord
,
with
an
eagerness
and
perplexity
of
tone
,
as
if
he
thought
the
lieutenant
knew
,
that
thereby
hangs
a
tale
;
)
and
Hatchway
supported
this
suspicion
,
by
answering
,
"
Nay
,
as
for
that
matter
,
the
curate
may
be
a
very
sufficient
man
in
his
way
.
<EOS>
"
This
transition
from
his
wife
to
the
curate
,
convinced
him
that
his
shame
was
known
to
his
guests
;
and
in
the
transport
of
his
indignation
,
he
pronounced
with
great
emphasis
,
"
A
sufficient
man
!
<EOS>
Odds
heart
!
<EOS>
I
believe
they
are
all
wolves
in
sheeps
cloathing
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
God
I
could
see
the
day
,
master
,
when
there
shall
not
be
a
priest
,
an
exciseman
,
or
a
custom
-
house
officer
in
this
kingdom
.
<EOS>
As
for
that
fellow
of
a
curate
,
if
I
do
catch
him
 
It
do
n't
signify
talking
 
<EOS>
But
,
by
the
Lord
!
  
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
my
service
to
you
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
associates
being
satisfied
by
these
abrupt
insinuations
,
that
they
had
so
far
succeeded
in
their
aim
,
waited
with
impatience
two
or
three
days
,
in
expectation
of
hearing
that
Tunley
had
fallen
upon
some
method
of
being
revenged
for
this
imaginary
wrong
:
but
finding
that
either
his
invention
was
too
shallow
,
or
his
inclination
too
languid
to
gratify
their
desire
of
his
own
accord
<EOS>
,
they
determined
to
bring
the
affair
to
such
a
crisis
,
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
withstand
the
opportunity
of
executing
his
vengeance
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
they
one
evening
hired
a
boy
to
run
to
Mr
Pickle
's
house
,
and
tell
the
curate
,
that
Mrs
Tunley
being
taken
suddenly
ill
,
her
husband
desired
he
would
come
immediately
,
and
pray
with
her
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
they
had
taken
possession
of
a
room
in
the
house
;
and
Hatchway
engaging
the
landlord
in
conversation
,
Peregrine
in
his
return
from
the
yard
observed
,
as
if
by
accident
,
that
the
parson
was
gone
into
the
kitchen
,
in
order
,
as
he
supposed
,
to
catechise
Tunley
's
wife
.
    
<EOS>
The
publican
started
at
this
intelligence
,
and
under
pretence
of
serving
another
company
in
the
next
room
,
went
out
to
the
barn
,
and
arming
himself
with
a
flail
,
repaired
to
a
lane
thro
'
which
the
curate
was
under
a
necessity
of
passing
in
his
way
home
.
<EOS>
There
he
lay
in
ambush
,
with
fell
intent
;
and
when
the
supposed
author
of
his
shame
arrived
,
greeted
him
in
the
dark
with
such
a
salutation
,
as
forced
him
to
stagger
backward
three
paces
at
least
.
<EOS>
If
the
second
application
had
taken
effect
,
in
all
probability
that
spot
would
have
been
the
boundary
of
the
parson
's
mortal
peregrination
;
but
,
luckily
for
him
,
his
antagonist
was
not
expert
in
the
management
of
his
weapon
,
which
,
by
a
twist
of
the
thong
that
connected
the
legs
,
instead
of
pitching
upon
the
head
of
the
astonished
curate
,
descended
in
an
oblique
direction
on
his
own
pate
,
with
such
a
swing
,
that
the
skull
actually
rung
like
an
apothecary
's
mortar
,
and
ten
thousand
lights
seemed
to
dance
before
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
The
curate
recollecting
himself
during
the
respite
he
obtained
from
this
accident
,
and
believing
his
aggressor
to
be
some
thief
who
lurked
in
that
place
for
prey
,
resolved
to
make
a
running
fight
,
until
he
should
arrive
within
cry
of
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
With
this
design
he
raised
up
his
cudgel
for
the
defence
of
his
head
,
and
betaking
himself
to
his
heels
,
began
to
roar
for
help
with
the
lungs
of
a
Stentor
.
    
<EOS>
Tunley
throwing
away
the
flail
,
which
he
durst
no
longer
trust
with
the
execution
of
his
revenge
,
pursued
the
fugitive
with
all
the
speed
he
could
exert
;
and
the
other
,
either
unnerv'd
by
fear
,
or
stumbling
over
a
stone
,
was
overtaken
before
he
had
run
an
hundred
paces
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
felt
the
wind
of
the
publican
's
fist
that
whistled
round
his
ears
,
than
he
fell
flat
upon
the
earth
at
full
length
,
and
the
cudgel
flew
from
his
unclasping
hand
;
when
Tunley
springing
like
a
tyger
upon
his
back
,
rained
such
a
shower
of
blows
upon
his
carcase
,
that
he
imagined
himself
under
the
discipline
of
ten
pair
of
fists
at
least
:
yet
the
imaginary
cuckold
,
not
satisfied
with
annoying
the
priest
in
this
manner
,
laid
hold
on
one
of
his
ears
with
his
teeth
,
and
bit
so
unmercifully
,
that
the
curate
was
found
almost
intranced
with
pain
by
two
labourers
,
at
whose
approach
the
assailant
retreated
unperceived
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
had
posted
himself
at
the
window
,
in
order
to
see
the
landlord
at
his
first
return
;
and
no
sooner
perceived
him
enter
the
yard
,
than
he
called
him
into
the
apartment
,
impatient
to
learn
the
effects
of
their
stratagem
.
<EOS>
Tunley
obeyed
the
summons
,
and
appeared
before
his
guests
in
all
the
violence
of
rage
,
disorder
and
fatigue
;
his
nostrils
were
dilated
more
than
one
half
beyond
their
natural
capacity
,
his
eyes
rolled
,
his
teeth
chattered
,
he
snored
in
breathing
as
if
he
had
been
oppressed
by
the
nightmare
,
and
streams
of
sweat
flowed
down
each
side
of
his
forehead
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
affecting
to
start
at
the
approach
of
such
an
uncouth
figure
,
asked
if
he
had
been
wrestling
with
a
spirit
;
upon
which
he
answered
with
great
vehemence
,
"
Spirit
!
<EOS>
No
,
no
,
master
,
I
have
had
a
roll
and
tumble
with
the
flesh
.
    
<EOS>
A
dog
!
<EOS>
I
'll
teach
him
to
come
a
caterwauling
about
my
doors
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Guessing
from
this
reply
,
that
his
aim
was
accomplished
,
and
curious
to
know
the
particulars
of
the
rencounter
,
"
Well
then
,
(
said
the
youth
)
<EOS>
I
hope
you
have
prevailed
against
the
flesh
,
Tunley
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
yes
,
(
answered
the
publican
)
<EOS>
I
have
cooled
his
capissens
,
as
the
saying
is
;
I
have
played
such
a
tune
about
his
ears
,
that
I
'll
be
bound
he
sha
n't
long
for
musick
this
month
.
<EOS>
A
goatish
ram
-
fac'd
rascal
!
<EOS>
Why
,
he
's
a
perfect
parish
bull
,
as
I
hope
to
live
.
"
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
observing
that
he
seemed
to
have
made
a
stout
battle
,
desired
he
would
sit
down
and
recover
wind
;
and
after
he
had
swallowed
a
brace
of
bumpers
,
his
vanity
prompted
him
to
expatiate
upon
his
own
exploit
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
confederates
,
without
seeming
to
know
the
curate
was
his
antagonist
,
became
acquainted
with
every
circumstance
of
the
ambuscade
.
    
<EOS>
Tunley
had
scarce
got
the
better
of
his
agitation
,
when
his
wife
entering
the
room
,
told
them
by
way
of
news
,
that
some
waggish
body
had
sent
Mr
Sackbut
the
curate
to
pray
with
her
.
<EOS>
This
name
inflamed
the
husband
's
choler
anew
,
and
forgetting
all
his
complaisance
for
his
spouse
,
he
replied
with
a
rancorous
grin
,
"
Add
rabbit
him
!
<EOS>
I
doubt
not
<EOS>
but
you
found
his
admonitions
deadly
comfortable
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
landlady
,
looking
at
her
vassal
with
a
sovereign
aspect
,
"
What
crotchets
(
said
she
)
have
you
got
in
your
fool
's
head
<EOS>
,
I
trow
?
<EOS>
I
know
no
business
you
have
to
sit
here
like
a
gentleman
with
you
<EOS>
arms
akimbe
,
when
there
's
another
company
in
the
house
to
be
served
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
submissive
husband
took
the
hint
,
and
without
further
expostulation
,
sneaked
out
of
the
room
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
it
was
reported
,
that
Mr
Sackbut
had
been
way
-
laid
,
and
almost
murdered
by
robbers
,
and
an
advertisement
pasted
upon
the
church
-
door
,
offering
a
reward
to
any
person
that
should
discover
the
assassin
;
but
he
reaped
no
satisfaction
from
this
expedient
,
and
was
confined
to
his
chamber
a
whole
fortnight
,
by
the
bruises
he
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXXIII
   
<EOS>
When
he
considered
the
circumstances
of
the
ambuscade
,
he
could
not
persuade
himself
that
he
had
been
assaulted
by
a
common
thief
,
because
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
a
robber
would
have
amused
himself
in
pummeling
rather
than
in
rifling
his
prey
;
he
therefore
ascribed
his
misfortune
to
the
secret
enmity
of
some
person
who
had
a
design
upon
his
life
;
and
upon
mature
deliberation
,
fixed
his
suspicion
upon
Peregrine
,
who
was
the
only
man
on
earth
from
whom
he
thought
he
deserved
such
treatment
.
<EOS>
He
communicated
this
conjecture
to
his
pupil
,
who
readily
adopted
his
opinion
,
and
advised
him
strenuously
to
revenge
the
wrong
by
a
like
contrivance
,
without
seeking
to
make
a
narrower
inquiry
,
lest
his
enemy
should
be
thereby
put
upon
his
guard
.
    
<EOS>
This
proposal
being
relished
,
they
in
concert
revolved
the
means
of
retorting
the
ambush
with
interest
,
and
actually
laid
such
a
villainous
plan
for
attacking
our
hero
in
the
dark
,
that
,
had
it
been
executed
according
to
their
intention
,
the
young
gentleman
's
scheme
of
travelling
would
have
been
effectually
marred
.
<EOS>
But
their
machinations
were
overheard
by
Miss
Pickle
,
who
was
now
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
her
age
,
and
,
in
spite
of
the
prejudice
of
education
,
entertained
in
secret
a
most
sisterly
affection
for
her
brother
Perry
,
though
she
had
never
spoke
to
him
,
and
was
deterred
by
the
precepts
,
vigilance
and
menaces
of
her
mother
,
from
attempting
any
means
of
meeting
him
in
private
.
<EOS>
She
was
not
,
however
,
insensible
to
his
praise
,
which
was
loudly
sounded
forth
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
never
failed
of
going
to
church
,
and
every
other
place
,
where
she
thought
she
might
have
an
opportunity
of
seeing
this
amiable
brother
.
<EOS>
With
these
sentiments
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
she
would
hear
the
conspiracy
without
emotion
.
<EOS>
She
was
shocked
at
the
treacherous
barbarity
of
Gam
,
and
shuddered
at
the
prospect
of
the
danger
to
which
Peregrine
would
be
exposed
from
their
malice
.
<EOS>
She
durst
not
communicate
this
plot
to
her
mother
,
because
she
was
afraid
that
lady
's
unaccountable
aversion
for
her
first
-
born
would
hinder
her
from
interposing
in
his
behalf
,
and
consequently
render
her
a
sort
of
accomplice
in
the
guilt
of
his
assassins
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
resolved
to
warn
Peregrine
of
the
conspiracy
,
an
account
of
which
she
transmitted
to
him
in
an
affectionate
letter
,
by
means
of
a
young
gentleman
in
that
neighbourhood
,
who
made
his
addresses
to
her
at
that
time
,
and
who
,
at
her
request
,
offered
his
service
to
our
hero
,
in
defeating
the
projects
of
his
adversaries
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
startled
when
he
read
the
particulars
of
their
scheme
,
which
was
no
other
than
an
intention
to
sally
upon
him
when
he
should
be
altogether
unprovided
against
such
an
attack
,
cut
off
his
ears
,
and
otherwise
mutilate
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
should
have
no
cause
to
be
vain
of
his
person
for
the
future
.
    
<EOS>
Incensed
as
he
was
against
the
brutal
disposition
of
his
own
father
's
son
,
he
could
not
help
being
moved
at
the
integrity
and
tenderness
of
his
sister
,
of
whose
inclinations
towards
him
he
had
been
hitherto
kept
in
ignorance
.
<EOS>
He
thanked
the
gentleman
for
his
honourable
dealing
,
and
expressed
a
desire
of
being
better
acquainted
with
his
virtues
;
told
him
,
that
now
he
was
cautioned
,
he
hoped
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
giving
him
any
further
trouble
,
and
wrote
by
him
a
letter
of
acknolwedgment
to
his
sister
,
for
whom
he
expressed
the
utmost
love
and
regard
,
beseeching
her
to
favour
him
with
an
interview
before
his
departure
,
that
he
might
indulge
his
fraternal
fondness
,
and
be
blessed
with
the
company
and
countenance
of
one
at
least
belonging
to
his
own
family
.
    
<EOS>
Having
imparted
this
discovery
to
his
friend
Hatchway
,
they
came
to
a
resolution
of
countermining
the
plan
of
their
enemies
;
and
as
they
did
not
choose
to
expose
themselves
to
the
insinuations
of
slander
,
which
would
have
exerted
itself
at
their
expence
,
had
they
,
even
in
defending
themselves
,
employed
any
harsh
means
of
retaliation
,
they
invented
a
method
of
disappointing
and
disgracing
their
foes
,
and
immediately
set
Pipes
at
work
to
forward
the
preparations
.
    
<EOS>
Miss
Pickle
having
described
the
spot
which
the
assassins
had
pitched
upon
for
the
scene
of
their
vengeance
,
our
triumvirate
intended
to
have
placed
a
centinel
among
the
corn
,
who
should
come
and
give
them
intelligence
when
the
ambuscade
was
laid
;
and
in
consequence
of
that
information
,
they
would
steal
softly
towards
the
place
,
attended
by
three
or
four
of
the
domesticks
,
and
draw
a
large
net
over
the
conspirators
,
who
being
intangled
in
the
toil
,
should
be
disarmed
,
fettered
,
heartily
scourged
,
and
suspended
between
two
trees
in
the
snare
,
as
a
spectacle
to
all
passengers
that
should
chance
to
travel
that
way
.
    
<EOS>
The
plan
being
thus
digested
,
and
the
commodore
made
acquainted
with
the
whole
affair
,
the
spy
was
sent
upon
duty
,
and
every
body
within
doors
prepared
to
go
forth
upon
the
first
notice
.
<EOS>
One
whole
evening
did
they
spend
in
the
most
impatient
expectation
,
but
on
the
second
their
scout
crept
into
the
garison
,
and
assured
them
that
he
had
perceived
three
men
skulking
behind
the
hedge
,
on
the
road
that
led
to
the
publick
house
from
which
Peregrine
and
the
lieutenant
used
every
night
to
return
about
that
hour
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
intelligence
the
confederates
set
out
immediately
with
all
their
implements
,
and
approaching
the
scene
with
as
little
noise
as
possible
,
they
heard
the
sound
of
blows
;
and
though
the
night
was
dark
,
perceived
a
sort
of
tumultuous
conflict
on
the
very
spot
which
the
conspirators
had
possessed
.
    
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
occurrence
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
,
Peregrine
ordered
his
myrmidons
to
halt
and
reconnoitre
;
and
immediately
his
ears
were
saluted
with
an
exclamation
of
"
You
sha
n't
scape
me
,
rascal
.
"
<EOS>
The
voice
being
quite
familiar
to
him
,
he
all
at
once
divined
the
cause
of
that
confusion
which
they
had
observed
;
and
running
up
to
the
assistance
of
the
exclaimer
,
found
a
fellow
on
his
knees
begging
his
life
of
Mr
Gauntlet
,
who
stood
over
him
with
a
naked
hanger
in
his
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
instantly
made
himself
known
to
his
friend
,
who
told
him
,
that
having
left
his
horse
at
Tunley
's
,
he
was
in
his
way
to
the
garison
set
upon
by
three
ruffians
,
one
of
whom
,
being
the
very
individual
person
now
in
his
power
,
had
come
behind
him
,
and
struck
with
a
bludgeon
at
his
head
,
which
however
he
missed
,
and
the
instrument
descended
on
his
left
shoulder
;
that
upon
drawing
his
hanger
,
and
laying
abut
him
in
the
dark
,
the
other
two
fled
,
leaving
their
companion
,
whom
he
had
disabled
,
in
the
lurch
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
congratulated
him
upon
his
safety
,
and
having
ordered
Pipes
to
secure
the
prisoner
,
conducted
Mr
Gauntlet
to
the
garison
,
where
he
met
with
a
very
hearty
reception
from
the
commodore
,
to
whom
he
was
introduced
as
his
nephew
's
intimate
friend
;
not
but
that
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
would
have
abated
somewhat
of
his
hospitality
,
had
he
known
that
he
was
the
brother
of
Perry
's
mistress
;
but
her
name
the
old
gentleman
had
never
thought
of
asking
,
when
he
inquired
into
the
particulars
of
his
godson
's
amour
.
    
<EOS>
The
captive
being
examined
,
in
presence
of
Trunnion
and
all
his
adherents
,
touching
the
ambuscade
,
owned
,
that
being
in
the
service
of
Gam
Pickle
,
he
had
been
prevailed
upon
by
the
sollicitations
of
his
master
and
the
curate
,
to
accompany
them
in
their
expedition
,
and
undertake
the
part
which
he
had
acted
against
the
stranger
,
whom
he
and
his
employers
mistook
for
Peregrine
.
<EOS>
In
consideration
of
this
frank
acknowledgment
,
and
a
severe
wound
he
had
received
in
his
right
arm
,
they
resolved
to
inflict
no
other
punishment
on
this
malefactor
,
than
to
detain
him
all
night
in
the
garison
,
and
next
morning
carry
him
before
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
to
whom
he
repeated
all
that
he
had
said
overnight
,
and
with
his
own
hand
subscribed
his
confession
,
copies
of
which
were
handed
about
the
neighbourhood
,
to
the
unspeakable
confusion
and
disgrace
of
the
curate
and
his
promising
pupil
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Trunnion
treated
the
young
soldier
with
uncommon
marks
of
respect
,
being
prepossessed
in
his
favour
by
this
adventure
,
which
he
had
so
gallantly
atchieved
,
as
well
as
by
the
encomiums
that
Peregrine
bestowed
upon
his
valour
and
generosity
.
<EOS>
He
liked
his
countenance
,
which
was
bold
and
hardy
,
admired
his
Herculean
limbs
,
and
delighted
in
asking
questions
concerning
the
service
he
had
seen
.
    
<EOS>
The
day
after
his
arrival
,
while
the
conversation
turned
on
this
last
subject
,
the
commodore
,
taking
the
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
,
"
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
brother
,
(
said
he
)
five
and
forty
years
ago
,
when
I
was
third
lieutenant
of
the
Warwick
man
of
war
,
there
was
a
very
stout
young
fellow
on
board
,
a
subaltern
officer
of
marines
;
his
name
was
not
unlike
your
own
,
d'ye
see
,
being
Guntlet
,
with
a
G.
    
<EOS>
I
remember
he
and
I
could
not
abide
one
another
at
first
,
because
,
d'ye
see
,
I
was
a
sailor
and
he
a
land
-
man
,
till
we
fell
in
with
a
Frenchman
,
whom
we
engaged
for
eight
glasses
,
and
at
length
boarded
and
took
.
<EOS>
I
was
the
first
man
that
stood
on
the
enemy
's
deck
,
and
should
have
come
scurvily
off
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
if
Guntlet
had
not
jumped
to
my
assistance
;
but
we
soon
cleared
ship
,
and
drove
them
to
close
quarters
,
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
strike
;
and
from
that
day
Guntlet
and
I
were
sworn
brothers
as
long
as
he
remained
on
board
.
<EOS>
He
was
exchanged
into
a
marching
regiment
,
and
what
became
of
him
afterwards
,
Lord
in
heaven
knows
;
but
this
I
'll
say
of
him
,
whether
he
be
dead
or
alive
,
he
feared
no
man
that
ever
wore
a
head
,
and
was
,
moreover
,
a
very
hearty
messmate
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
stranger
's
breast
glowed
at
this
eulogium
,
which
was
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
he
eagerly
asked
,
if
the
French
ship
was
not
the
Diligence
?
<EOS>
The
commodore
replied
with
a
stare
,
"
The
very
same
,
my
lad
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
(
said
Gauntlet
)
<EOS>
the
person
of
whom
you
are
pleased
to
make
such
honourable
mention
was
my
own
father
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
devil
he
was
!
<EOS>
(
cried
Trunnion
,
shaking
him
by
the
hand
)
<EOS>
I
am
rejoiced
to
see
a
son
of
Ned
Gauntlet
in
my
house
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
discovery
introduced
a
thousand
questions
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
the
old
gentleman
learnt
the
situation
of
his
friend
's
family
,
and
discharged
innumerable
execrations
upon
the
ingratitude
and
injustice
of
the
ministry
,
which
had
failed
to
provide
for
the
son
of
such
a
brave
soldier
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
friendship
confined
to
such
ineffectual
expressions
;
he
that
same
evening
signified
to
Peregrine
a
desire
of
doing
something
for
his
friend
;
and
this
inclination
was
so
much
praised
,
encouraged
and
promoted
by
his
godson
,
and
even
supported
by
his
counsellor
Hatchway
,
that
our
hero
was
empowered
to
present
him
with
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
purchase
a
commission
.
    
<EOS>
Though
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
Pickle
than
this
permission
,
he
was
afraid
that
Godfrey
's
scrupulous
disposition
would
hinder
him
from
subjecting
himself
to
any
such
obligation
;
and
therefore
proposed
that
he
should
be
decoyed
into
his
own
interest
by
a
feigned
story
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
would
be
prevailed
upon
to
accept
of
the
money
,
as
a
debt
which
the
commodore
had
contracted
of
his
father
at
sea
.
<EOS>
Trunnion
made
wry
faces
at
this
expedient
,
the
necessity
of
which
he
could
not
conceive
,
without
calling
in
question
the
common
sense
of
Gauntlet
,
as
he
took
it
for
granted
,
that
such
offers
as
those
were
not
to
be
rejected
on
any
consideration
whatever
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
could
not
digest
an
artifice
,
by
which
he
himself
must
own
that
he
had
lived
so
many
years
,
without
manifesting
the
least
intention
of
doing
justice
to
his
creditor
.
<EOS>
All
these
objections
,
however
,
were
removed
by
the
zeal
and
rhetoric
of
Peregrine
,
who
represented
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
befriend
him
on
any
other
terms
;
that
his
silence
hitherto
would
be
imputed
to
his
want
of
information
touching
the
circumstances
and
condition
of
his
friend
;
and
that
his
remembring
and
insisting
upon
discharging
the
obligation
,
after
such
an
interval
of
time
,
when
the
whole
affair
was
in
oblivion
,
would
be
the
greatest
compliment
he
could
pay
to
his
own
honour
and
integrity
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
persuaded
,
he
took
an
opportunity
of
Gauntlet
's
being
alone
with
him
to
broach
the
affair
,
telling
the
young
man
,
that
his
father
had
advanced
a
sum
of
money
for
him
,
when
they
sailed
together
,
on
account
of
the
mess
,
as
well
as
to
stop
the
mouth
of
a
clamorous
creditor
at
Portsmouth
;
and
that
the
said
sum
,
with
interest
,
amounted
to
about
four
hundred
pounds
,
which
he
would
now
,
with
great
thankfulness
,
repay
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
amazed
at
this
declaration
,
and
after
a
considerable
pause
replied
,
that
he
had
never
heard
his
parents
mention
any
such
debt
;
that
no
memorandum
or
voucher
of
it
was
found
among
his
father
's
papers
;
and
that
,
in
all
probability
,
it
must
have
been
discharged
long
ago
,
although
the
commodore
,
in
such
a
long
course
of
time
and
hurry
of
occupation
,
might
have
forgot
the
repayment
:
he
therefore
desired
to
be
excused
from
accepting
what
in
his
own
conscience
he
believed
was
not
his
due
;
and
complimented
the
old
gentleman
upon
his
being
so
scrupulously
just
and
honourable
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
's
refusal
,
which
was
matter
of
astonishment
to
Trunnion
,
increased
his
inclination
to
assist
him
;
and
,
on
pretence
of
acquitting
his
own
character
,
he
urged
his
beneficence
with
such
obstinacy
,
that
Gauntlet
,
afraid
of
disobliging
him
,
was
in
a
manner
compelled
to
receive
a
draught
for
the
money
,
for
which
he
subscribed
an
ample
discharge
,
and
immediately
transmitted
the
order
to
his
mother
,
whom
at
the
same
time
he
informed
of
the
circumstances
by
which
they
had
so
unexpectedly
gained
this
accession
of
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
piece
of
news
could
not
fail
of
being
agreeable
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
who
by
the
first
post
wrote
a
polite
letter
of
acknowledgment
to
the
commodore
,
another
to
her
own
son
,
importing
,
that
she
had
already
sent
the
draught
to
a
friend
in
London
,
with
directions
to
deposit
it
in
the
hands
of
a
certain
banker
,
for
the
purchase
of
the
first
ensigncy
to
be
sold
;
and
she
took
the
liberty
of
sending
a
third
to
Peregrine
,
couched
in
very
affectionate
terms
,
with
a
kind
postscript
,
signed
by
Miss
Sophy
and
his
charming
Emily
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
transacted
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
concerned
,
preparations
were
set
on
foot
for
the
departure
of
our
hero
,
on
whom
his
uncle
settled
an
annuity
of
eight
hundred
pounds
,
being
little
less
than
one
half
of
his
whole
income
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
indeed
the
old
gentleman
could
easily
afford
to
alienate
such
a
part
of
his
fortune
,
because
he
entertained
little
or
no
company
,
kept
few
servants
,
was
remarkably
plain
and
frugal
in
his
house
-
keeping
;
and
Mrs
Trunnion
being
now
some
years
on
the
wrong
side
of
fifty
,
her
infirmities
began
to
increase
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
her
pride
had
suffered
no
diminution
,
her
vanity
was
altogether
subdued
by
her
avarice
.
    
<EOS>
A
Swiss
valet
de
chambre
,
who
had
already
made
the
tour
of
Europe
,
was
hired
for
the
care
of
Peregrine
's
own
person
;
and
Pipes
being
ignorant
of
the
French
language
,
as
well
as
otherwise
unfit
for
the
office
of
a
fashionable
attendant
,
it
was
resolved
that
he
should
remain
in
garison
,
and
his
place
was
immediately
supplied
by
a
Parisian
lacquey
engaged
at
London
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
Pipes
did
not
seem
to
relish
this
disposition
of
things
;
and
though
he
made
no
verbal
objections
to
it
,
looked
remarkably
sour
at
his
successor
upon
his
first
arrival
;
but
this
sullen
fit
seemed
gradually
to
wear
off
;
and
long
before
his
master
's
departure
,
he
had
recovered
his
natural
tranquility
and
unconcern
.

Chapter
XXXIV
<EOS>
The
two
young
gentlemen
display
their
talents
for
gallantry
,
in
the
course
of
which
they
are
involved
in
a
ludicrous
circumstance
of
distress
,
and
afterwards
take
vengeance
on
the
author
of
their
mishap
.
   
<EOS>
Mean
while
our
hero
and
his
new
friend
,
together
with
honest
Jack
Hatchway
,
made
daily
excursions
into
the
country
,
visited
the
gentlemen
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
frequently
accompanied
them
to
the
chace
;
all
three
being
exceedingly
caressed
on
account
of
their
talents
,
which
could
accommodate
themselves
with
great
facility
to
the
tempers
and
turns
of
their
entertainers
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
was
a
droll
in
his
way
,
Peregrine
possessed
a
great
fund
of
sprightliness
and
good
humour
,
and
Godfrey
,
among
his
other
qualifications
already
recited
,
sung
a
most
excellent
song
;
so
that
the
company
of
this
triumvirate
was
courted
in
all
parties
,
whether
male
or
female
;
and
if
the
hearts
of
our
young
gentlemen
had
not
been
pre
-
engaged
,
they
would
have
met
with
opportunities
in
abundance
of
displaying
their
address
in
the
art
of
love
;
<EOS>
not
but
that
they
gave
a
loose
to
their
gallantry
without
much
interesting
their
affections
,
and
amused
themselves
with
little
intrigues
,
which
,
in
the
opinion
of
a
man
of
pleasure
,
do
not
affect
his
fidelity
to
the
acknowledged
sovereign
of
his
soul
.
    
<EOS>
Had
they
used
those
advantages
which
their
skill
and
accomplishments
gave
them
over
the
warm
unpractised
minds
of
the
young
ladies
to
whom
they
had
access
,
almost
every
family
in
the
county
,
might
have
had
cause
to
rue
their
acquaintance
;
but
our
adventurers
,
wild
and
licentious
as
they
were
,
governed
their
actions
by
certain
notions
of
honour
,
which
they
never
presumed
to
infringe
,
and
therefore
,
no
domestic
tragedies
took
rise
from
their
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Among
the
lower
class
of
people
,
they
did
not
act
with
the
same
virtuous
moderation
,
but
laid
close
siege
to
every
buxom
country
damsel
that
fell
in
their
way
;
imagining
that
their
dalliance
with
such
Dulcineas
could
produce
no
fatal
effects
;
and
that
it
would
be
in
their
power
to
attone
for
any
damage
these
inamorata
's
might
sustain
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
prosecution
of
these
amours
,
Gauntlet
could
not
help
discovering
a
particular
biass
towards
married
women
,
and
when
questioned
by
his
friend
,
defended
his
singularity
of
taste
,
by
observing
that
such
connections
,
if
discreetly
managed
,
are
attended
by
none
of
those
bad
consequences
which
commonly
pursue
an
amorous
correspondence
with
single
persons
;
because
the
wedded
dame
's
fortune
is
already
made
,
and
her
husband
stands
as
a
buttress
before
her
reputation
.
    
<EOS>
Though
Peregrine
could
not
approve
of
this
maxim
which
the
soldier
had
adopted
in
the
course
of
a
military
education
,
he
could
not
avoid
engaging
as
a
second
and
confidant
to
his
friend
,
in
an
intrigue
which
he
carried
on
with
a
farmer
's
wife
in
the
neighbourhood
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
had
practised
all
his
arts
in
attempting
to
overcome
the
chastity
of
this
woman
,
who
was
an
hale
rosy
wench
,
lately
married
;
and
at
length
succeeded
so
far
in
his
addresses
,
that
she
promised
to
admit
him
one
night
when
her
husband
would
be
absent
on
business
,
which
called
him
once
a
fortnight
to
the
next
market
town
.
    
<EOS>
He
communicated
his
good
fortune
to
Perry
,
desiring
that
he
would
accompany
him
to
the
place
,
in
case
of
accident
;
and
our
young
gentleman
having
undertaken
the
office
of
standing
centinel
over
his
friend
,
while
he
should
enjoy
his
conquest
,
they
set
out
at
the
time
appointed
,
and
arriving
at
the
door
,
the
gallant
made
the
signal
which
had
been
agreed
upon
,
and
was
let
in
accordingly
,
after
having
assured
his
confidant
that
he
would
be
with
him
again
in
two
hours
at
farthest
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
left
to
his
own
meditations
,
our
hero
began
his
patrole
,
beguiling
the
time
with
the
most
amusing
fancies
of
a
glowing
imagination
,
and
enjoying
by
anticipation
all
the
pleasures
attending
affluence
and
youth
,
till
at
length
his
reverie
was
interrupted
by
a
plump
shower
that
compelled
him
to
seek
for
shelter
in
a
sort
of
shed
,
the
door
of
which
stood
open
to
his
view
.
<EOS>
Thither
therefore
he
betook
himself
,
and
groping
about
as
he
entered
in
the
dark
,
chanced
to
lay
hold
on
a
bushy
beard
,
to
his
infinite
surprize
and
consternation
.
<EOS>
Before
he
had
time
to
form
any
conjecture
concerning
this
strange
object
of
his
touch
,
he
received
a
sudden
shock
upon
his
forehead
that
felled
him
to
the
ground
in
an
instant
,
and
as
he
lay
,
underwent
the
trampling
of
a
huge
body
that
rushed
over
him
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
In
this
attitude
he
remained
extended
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
,
before
he
recovered
the
use
of
sensation
which
he
had
lost
,
and
then
he
perceived
the
blood
trickling
down
from
his
temples
in
a
double
stream
.
    
<EOS>
The
cause
of
this
misfortune
was
still
a
mystery
to
him
,
and
he
made
shift
to
rise
,
cursing
his
fate
for
having
sustained
such
visible
marks
of
disgrace
in
the
exercise
of
such
a
ridiculous
office
;
when
strolling
about
with
his
handkerchief
applied
to
his
hurts
,
he
discerned
on
the
farther
side
of
a
tree
a
pair
of
large
eyes
glancing
like
two
coals
of
fire
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
unsheathed
his
hanger
,
in
the
belief
that
now
he
had
found
the
author
of
his
mischance
;
and
springing
forward
on
his
adversary
,
aimed
a
furious
stroke
that
entered
the
body
of
the
tree
,
in
which
his
weapon
stuck
so
fast
,
that
he
could
not
disengage
it
without
some
difficulty
;
while
the
object
of
his
wrath
made
a
precipitate
retreat
,
and
by
an
exclamation
,
gave
him
to
know
that
his
assailant
was
no
other
than
an
he
-
goat
.
    
<EOS>
Mad
as
he
was
with
indignation
and
shame
,
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ludicrous
adventure
,
and
had
just
set
his
invention
at
work
to
find
some
plausible
excuse
which
he
might
make
to
the
world
,
for
the
patches
he
knew
he
must
wear
on
his
face
,
when
a
window
of
the
first
story
flying
open
,
he
saw
something
white
descend
with
astonishing
velocity
,
and
running
to
the
spot
,
found
his
friend
Godfrey
naked
to
the
shirt
.
<EOS>
Confounded
at
his
condition
,
he
began
to
inquire
into
the
reason
of
his
precipitation
,
but
received
no
answer
until
he
had
followed
the
fugitive
to
a
place
where
they
could
not
be
overheard
.
    
<EOS>
There
he
understood
that
the
soldier
had
been
decoyed
into
the
snare
by
the
connivance
of
the
husband
,
by
whose
direction
he
had
(
without
all
doubt
)
been
admitted
not
only
into
the
house
,
but
even
into
his
wife
's
own
bed
,
where
the
jilt
had
left
him
undressed
,
on
pretence
of
fastening
the
doors
,
but
in
reality
with
a
view
of
giving
the
hint
to
the
farmer
,
who
armed
with
a
pitchfork
and
supported
by
his
man
,
entered
the
room
before
he
was
aware
,
secured
his
sword
and
cloaths
,
and
obliged
him
to
take
refuge
in
a
closet
,
from
the
window
of
which
he
had
thrown
himself
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
resentment
of
the
boor
,
and
the
disgrace
as
well
as
expence
of
being
taken
in
that
situation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
tempted
to
laugh
at
the
ridiculous
issue
of
this
adventure
,
but
restrained
himself
in
consideration
of
his
friend
's
temper
and
condition
,
neither
of
which
were
at
that
time
proper
objects
of
mirth
;
and
stripping
off
his
own
coat
,
accommodated
Godfrey
's
naked
shoulders
;
then
after
mature
deliberation
,
they
determined
to
leave
the
spoil
in
the
hands
of
the
enemy
,
because
they
foresaw
it
would
be
altogether
impracticable
to
retrieve
it
,
as
well
as
hazardous
both
to
their
persons
and
reputation
,
to
make
any
attempt
towards
the
recovery
of
what
was
lost
;
the
two
friends
,
therefore
,
made
their
retreat
in
this
trim
to
the
garison
,
and
the
farmer
remained
in
possession
of
all
the
soldier
's
cloaths
,
sword
and
ready
money
,
to
the
amount
of
ten
pounds
.
<EOS>
But
here
the
disaster
did
not
end
,
the
malicious
peasant
propagated
the
whole
story
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
an
advertisement
was
pasted
on
the
church
door
,
for
the
perusal
of
the
whole
parish
,
giving
a
description
of
the
goods
,
signifying
the
place
where
they
were
found
,
and
offering
to
restore
them
to
any
person
who
should
prove
himself
the
right
owner
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
mortifying
joke
to
Gauntlet
,
who
was
ashamed
to
shew
himself
for
a
whole
week
;
nor
was
Peregrine
exempted
from
a
share
of
the
disgrace
,
to
which
he
was
exposed
by
the
marks
on
his
forehead
,
that
confined
him
also
to
the
house
,
and
subjected
him
to
the
ridicule
of
the
commodore
,
who
having
heard
the
story
,
rallied
the
two
adventurers
,
observing
that
it
was
well
<EOS>
Gauntlet
's
mast
had
not
gone
along
with
his
rigging
;
and
asking
if
the
cuckold
's
horns
had
run
foul
of
Peregrine
's
bows
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
chanced
to
be
present
,
very
demurely
checked
her
husband
for
his
profane
scoffing
,
and
in
a
severe
lecture
,
rebuked
the
young
men
for
their
profligate
courses
,
which
,
if
they
were
not
relinquished
in
time
,
would
bring
their
bodies
into
trouble
in
this
life
,
and
their
souls
into
perdition
in
that
which
is
to
come
.
<EOS>
While
these
fellow
-
sufferers
were
obliged
to
keep
within
doors
,
they
held
frequent
consultations
with
the
lieutenant
,
concerning
some
means
of
revenge
,
which
the
soldier
was
bent
upon
taking
;
because
he
could
not
forgive
the
double
dealing
of
his
mistress
,
who
,
he
thought
,
might
have
declined
his
solicitations
,
without
inveigling
him
into
such
a
disgraceful
situation
.
<EOS>
After
much
deliberation
,
they
resolved
to
wait
patiently
,
and
watch
for
the
husband
's
absence
,
when
by
a
stratagem
they
had
concerted
,
they
would
endeavour
to
obtain
admittance
,
and
punish
the
wife
's
perfidy
,
by
fixing
her
as
a
monument
,
with
her
posteriors
thrust
out
at
a
window
,
for
the
contemplation
of
her
spouse
when
he
should
return
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
The
plan
being
laid
<EOS>
,
Peregrine
found
means
to
make
himself
acquainted
with
the
farmer
's
voice
and
manner
of
speaking
,
which
he
overheard
one
night
at
Tunley
's
;
and
likewise
to
procure
information
of
the
day
upon
which
he
always
went
to
a
certain
market
,
in
order
to
dispose
of
his
wheat
,
at
such
a
distance
,
that
he
seldom
failed
of
being
abroad
all
night
.
    
<EOS>
According
to
this
intelligence
,
the
confederates
attended
by
Pipes
,
set
out
one
evening
about
nine
o'clock
for
the
house
of
the
delinquent
,
where
the
lieutenant
and
Tom
being
placed
at
different
avenues
to
prevent
interruption
,
the
two
young
gentlemen
approached
the
door
which
was
locked
,
and
Peregrine
in
the
rustic
tone
of
the
farmer
demanded
entrance
;
the
wife
never
doubting
that
her
husband
was
returned
,
in
consequence
of
having
met
with
a
speedier
sale
than
usual
,
sent
her
maid
to
let
him
in
,
and
the
door
was
no
sooner
opened
,
than
our
adventurers
rushed
into
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
mistress
was
struck
dumb
with
consternation
,
mistaking
them
for
robbers
,
because
they
wore
vizors
,
and
were
otherwise
disguised
;
while
the
servant
wench
,
terrified
with
the
same
apprehension
,
fell
upon
her
knees
,
and
begged
they
would
spare
her
life
and
take
all
she
had
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
taking
the
wife
by
the
hand
,
led
her
trembling
into
that
very
chamber
which
had
been
the
scene
of
his
misfortune
,
where
pulling
off
his
mask
,
he
upbraided
her
with
the
treachery
she
had
practised
upon
him
,
and
intimated
the
intention
of
his
present
visit
.
<EOS>
The
lady
asked
pardon
for
what
she
had
done
with
such
submission
,
and
deprecated
his
wrath
so
pathetically
,
that
his
heart
relented
,
and
he
proposed
terms
of
accommodation
,
which
with
some
seeming
reluctance
she
embraced
,
and
he
forthwith
enjoyed
a
more
agreeable
revenge
than
that
which
he
in
his
ire
had
projected
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
Peregrine
guessing
the
good
fortune
of
his
friend
,
and
allured
by
the
attractions
of
the
maid
,
who
was
a
cleanly
florid
girl
,
employed
his
address
to
such
effectual
purpose
,
that
she
yielded
to
his
efforts
;
and
he
was
as
happy
as
such
a
conquest
could
make
him
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
and
his
companion
having
thus
obtained
all
the
satisfaction
they
required
,
and
settled
a
correspondence
which
they
did
not
afterwards
neglect
,
retired
in
peace
,
applauding
themselves
on
their
success
,
and
found
their
two
centinels
on
their
posts
,
whom
they
amused
with
a
feigned
story
of
having
been
so
much
moved
by
the
tears
and
supplications
of
the
criminal
,
that
they
desisted
from
their
scheme
of
exposing
her
,
and
only
inflicted
the
punishment
of
flagellation
,
which
,
they
said
,
she
had
undergone
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
was
not
well
pleased
when
he
found
himself
disappointed
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
her
in
the
attitude
to
which
she
had
been
in
council
decreed
;
and
Hatchway
,
though
he
pretended
to
acquiesce
in
their
account
,
saw
through
the
pretence
,
and
ascribed
their
long
stay
to
the
true
motive
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXXV
   
<EOS>
Two
days
after
this
atchievement
was
so
happily
accomplished
,
our
hero
received
an
intimation
from
his
sister
,
that
she
should
be
overjoyed
to
meet
him
next
day
,
at
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
at
the
house
of
her
nurse
,
who
lived
in
a
cottage
hard
by
her
father
's
habitation
,
she
being
debarred
from
all
opportunity
of
seeing
him
in
any
other
place
by
the
severity
of
her
mother
,
who
suspected
her
inclination
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
obeyed
the
summons
,
and
went
at
the
time
appointed
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
he
met
this
affectionate
young
lady
,
who
when
he
entered
the
room
,
ran
towards
him
with
all
the
eagerness
of
transport
;
flung
her
arms
about
his
neck
,
and
shed
a
flood
of
tears
in
his
bosom
before
she
could
utter
one
word
,
except
a
repetition
of
my
dear
,
dear
brother
!
<EOS>
He
embraced
her
with
all
the
piety
of
fraternal
tenderness
,
wept
over
her
in
his
turn
,
assured
her
that
this
was
one
of
the
happiest
moments
of
his
life
,
and
kindly
thanked
her
for
having
resisted
the
example
,
and
disobeyed
the
injunctions
of
his
mother
's
unnatural
aversion
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
ravished
to
find
by
her
conversation
,
that
she
possessed
a
great
share
of
sensibility
and
prudent
reflexion
;
for
she
lamented
the
infatuation
of
her
parents
with
the
most
filial
regret
,
and
expressed
such
abhorrence
and
concern
at
the
villainous
disposition
of
her
younger
brother
,
as
a
humane
sister
may
be
supposed
to
have
entertained
.
<EOS>
He
made
her
acquainted
with
all
the
circumstances
of
his
own
fortune
,
and
as
he
supposed
she
spent
her
time
very
disagreeably
at
home
,
among
characters
which
must
be
shockingly
interesting
,
professed
a
desire
of
moving
her
into
some
other
sphere
,
where
she
could
live
with
more
tranquillity
and
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
She
objected
to
this
proposal
as
an
expedient
that
would
infallibly
subject
her
to
the
implacable
resentment
of
her
mother
,
whose
favour
and
affection
she
at
present
enjoyed
but
in
a
very
inconsiderable
degree
;
and
they
had
canvassed
divers
schemes
of
corresponding
for
the
future
when
the
voice
of
Mrs
Pickle
was
heard
at
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
Miss
July
(
that
was
the
young
lady
's
name
)
<EOS>
finding
herself
betrayed
,
was
seized
with
a
violent
agitation
of
fear
,
and
Peregrine
scarce
had
time
to
encourage
her
with
a
promise
of
protection
,
before
the
door
of
the
apartment
being
flung
open
,
this
irreconcileable
parent
rushed
in
,
and
with
a
furious
aspect
flew
directly
at
her
trembling
daughter
,
when
the
son
interposing
,
received
the
first
discharge
of
her
fury
.
    
<EOS>
Her
eyes
gleamed
with
all
the
rage
of
indignation
,
which
choaked
up
her
utterance
,
and
seemed
to
convulse
her
whole
frame
;
she
twisted
her
left
hand
in
his
hair
,
and
with
the
other
buffeted
him
about
the
face
,
till
the
blood
gushed
from
his
nostrils
and
mouth
;
while
he
defended
his
sister
from
the
cruelty
of
Gam
,
who
assaulted
her
from
another
quarter
,
seeing
his
brother
engaged
.
<EOS>
This
attack
lasted
several
minutes
with
great
violence
,
till
at
length
Peregrine
finding
himself
in
danger
of
being
overpowered
,
if
he
should
remain
any
longer
on
the
defensive
,
laid
his
brother
on
his
back
;
and
before
he
could
get
up
again
,
disentangled
his
mother
's
hand
from
his
own
hair
,
and
having
pushed
her
gently
out
of
the
room
,
bolted
the
door
on
the
inside
;
then
turning
to
Gam
,
threw
him
out
at
the
window
,
among
a
parcel
of
hogs
that
fed
under
it
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Julia
was
almost
quite
distracted
with
terror
;
she
knew
she
had
offended
beyond
all
hope
of
forgiveness
,
and
from
that
moment
considered
herself
as
an
exile
from
her
father
's
house
;
in
vain
did
her
brother
strive
to
console
her
with
fresh
protestations
of
love
and
protection
,
she
counted
herself
extremely
miserable
in
being
obliged
to
endure
the
eternal
resentment
of
a
parent
with
whom
she
had
hitherto
lived
,
and
dreaded
the
censure
of
the
world
,
which
from
her
mother
's
misrepresentation
she
was
sensible
would
condemn
her
unheard
.
    
<EOS>
That
she
might
not
however
neglect
any
means
in
her
power
of
averting
this
storm
,
she
resolved
to
appease
,
if
possible
,
her
mother
's
wrath
with
humiliation
,
and
even
appeal
to
the
influence
of
her
father
,
weak
as
it
was
,
before
she
would
despair
of
being
forgiven
.
<EOS>
But
the
good
lady
spared
her
this
unnecessary
application
,
by
telling
her
through
the
key
-
hole
<EOS>
,
that
she
must
never
expect
to
come
within
her
father
's
door
again
;
for
from
that
hour
she
renounced
her
as
unworthy
of
her
affection
and
regard
.
<EOS>
Julia
weeping
bitterly
,
endeavoured
to
soften
the
rigour
of
this
sentence
,
by
the
most
submissive
and
reasonable
remonstrances
;
but
as
in
her
vindication
she
of
necessity
espoused
her
elder
brother
's
cause
,
her
endeavours
instead
of
soothing
,
served
only
to
exasperate
her
mother
to
an
higher
pitch
of
indignation
,
which
discharged
itself
in
invectives
against
Peregrine
,
whom
she
reviled
with
the
epithets
of
a
worthless
abandoned
reprobate
.
    
<EOS>
The
youth
hearing
these
unjust
aspersions
,
trembled
with
resentment
through
every
limb
,
assuring
the
upbraider
that
he
considered
her
as
an
object
of
compassion
;
"
for
without
all
doubt
,
said
he
,
your
diabolic
rancour
must
be
severely
punished
by
the
thorns
of
your
own
conscience
,
which
this
very
instant
taxes
you
with
the
malice
and
falsehood
of
your
reproaches
.
<EOS>
As
for
my
sister
,
I
bless
God
that
you
have
not
been
able
to
infect
her
with
your
unnatural
prejudice
,
which
because
she
is
too
just
,
too
virtuous
,
too
humane
to
imbibe
,
you
reject
her
as
an
alien
to
your
blood
,
and
turn
her
out
unprovided
into
a
barbarous
world
.
    
<EOS>
But
even
there
your
vitious
purpose
shall
be
defeated
;
that
same
providence
that
screened
me
from
the
cruelty
of
your
hate
shall
extend
its
protection
to
her
,
until
I
shall
find
it
convenient
to
assert
by
law
that
right
of
maintenance
<EOS>
which
nature
,
it
seems
,
hath
bestowed
upon
us
in
vain
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
you
will
enjoy
the
satisfaction
of
paying
an
undivided
attention
to
that
darling
son
,
whose
amiable
qualities
have
so
long
engaged
and
engrossed
your
love
and
esteem
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
freedom
of
expostulation
exalted
his
mother
's
ire
to
meer
frenzy
;
she
cursed
him
with
the
bitterest
imprecations
,
and
raved
like
a
Bedlamite
at
the
door
,
which
she
attempted
to
burst
open
.
<EOS>
Her
efforts
were
seconded
by
her
favourite
son
,
who
denounced
vengeance
against
Peregrine
,
made
furious
assaults
against
the
lock
,
which
resisted
all
their
applications
,
until
our
hero
espying
his
friend
Gauntlet
and
Pipes
stepping
over
a
style
that
stood
about
a
furlong
from
the
window
,
called
them
to
his
assistance
;
and
giving
them
to
understand
how
he
was
besieged
,
desired
they
would
keep
off
his
mother
,
that
he
might
the
more
easily
secure
his
sister
Julia
's
retreat
.
<EOS>
The
young
soldier
entered
accordingly
,
and
posting
himself
between
Mrs
Pickle
and
the
door
,
gave
the
signal
to
his
friend
,
who
lifting
up
his
sister
in
his
arms
,
carried
her
safe
without
the
clutches
of
this
she
-
dragon
,
while
Pipes
with
his
cudgel
kept
young
master
at
bay
.
    
<EOS>
The
mother
being
thus
deprived
of
her
prey
,
sprung
upon
Gauntlet
like
a
lioness
robbed
of
her
whelps
,
and
he
must
have
suffered
sorely
in
the
flesh
,
had
he
not
prevented
her
mischievous
intent
by
seizing
both
her
wrists
,
and
so
keeping
her
at
due
distance
.
<EOS>
In
attempting
to
disengage
herself
from
his
grasp
,
she
struggled
with
such
exertion
,
and
suffered
such
agony
of
passion
at
the
same
time
,
that
she
actually
fell
into
a
severe
fit
,
during
which
she
was
put
to
bed
,
and
<EOS>
the
confederates
retired
without
further
molestation
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Peregrine
was
not
a
little
perplexed
about
the
disposal
of
his
sister
whom
he
had
rescued
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
endure
the
thoughts
of
saddling
the
commodore
with
a
new
expence
;
and
he
was
afraid
of
undertaking
the
charge
of
Julia
,
without
his
benefactor
's
advice
and
direction
:
for
the
present
,
however
,
he
carried
her
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
whose
lady
was
her
godmother
,
where
she
was
received
with
great
tenderness
and
condolance
;
and
he
proposed
to
inquire
for
some
creditable
house
,
where
she
might
be
genteelly
boarded
in
his
absence
,
resolving
to
maintain
her
from
the
savings
of
his
own
allowance
,
which
he
thought
might
very
well
bear
such
deduction
.
<EOS>
But
this
intention
was
frustrated
by
the
publication
of
the
whole
affair
,
which
was
divulged
next
day
,
and
soon
reached
the
ears
of
Trunnion
,
who
chid
his
godson
for
having
concealed
the
adventure
;
and
,
with
the
approbation
of
his
wife
,
ordered
him
to
bring
Julia
forthwith
to
the
garison
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
with
tears
of
gratitude
in
his
eyes
,
explained
his
design
of
maintaining
her
at
his
own
expence
,
and
earnestly
begged
that
he
might
not
be
deprived
of
that
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
But
his
uncle
was
deaf
to
all
his
intreaties
,
and
insisted
upon
her
living
in
the
garison
,
though
for
no
other
reason
than
that
of
being
company
to
her
aunt
,
who
,
he
observed
,
was
lost
for
want
of
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
Julia
was
accordingly
brought
home
,
and
setled
under
the
tuition
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
,
whatever
face
she
might
put
on
the
matter
,
could
have
dispensed
with
the
society
of
her
niece
;
though
she
was
not
without
hope
of
gratifying
her
pique
at
Mrs
Pickle
,
by
the
intelligence
she
would
receive
from
the
daughter
,
of
that
lady
's
oeconomy
and
domestic
behaviour
.
<EOS>
The
mother
herself
seemed
conscious
of
this
advantage
which
her
sister
-
in
-
law
had
now
gained
over
her
,
being
as
much
chagrined
at
the
news
of
Julia
's
reception
at
the
garison
,
as
if
she
had
heard
of
her
own
husband
's
death
.
<EOS>
She
even
tortured
her
invention
to
propagate
calumnies
against
the
reputation
of
her
own
daughter
,
whom
she
slandered
in
all
companies
;
she
exclaimed
against
the
commodore
as
an
old
ruffian
who
spirited
up
a
rebellion
among
her
children
,
and
imputed
the
hospitality
of
his
wife
,
in
countenancing
them
,
to
nothing
else
but
her
inveterate
enmity
to
their
mother
,
whom
they
had
disobliged
.
<EOS>
She
now
insisted
,
in
the
most
peremptory
terms
,
upon
her
husband
's
renouncing
all
commerce
with
the
old
lad
of
the
castle
and
his
adherents
;
and
Mr
Gamaliel
having
by
this
time
contracted
other
friendships
,
readily
submitted
to
her
will
,
and
even
refused
to
communicate
with
the
commodore
one
night
,
when
they
happened
to
meet
by
accident
at
the
public
house
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXXVI
<EOS>
The
commodore
sends
a
challenge
to
Gamaliel
,
and
is
imposed
upon
by
a
waggish
invention
of
the
lieutenant
,
Peregrine
and
Gauntlet
.
   
<EOS>
This
affront
Trunnion
could
by
no
means
digest
<EOS>
:
he
advised
with
the
lieutenant
upon
the
subject
;
and
the
result
of
their
consultation
was
a
defiance
which
the
old
commander
sent
to
Pickle
,
demanding
that
he
would
meet
him
at
such
a
place
on
horseback
with
a
brace
of
pistols
,
and
give
satisfaction
for
the
slight
he
had
put
upon
him
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
afforded
more
pleasure
to
Jack
,
than
the
acceptance
of
this
challenge
,
which
he
delivered
verbally
to
Mr
Gamaliel
,
who
was
called
out
from
the
club
at
Tunley
's
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
this
message
had
an
instantaneous
effect
upon
the
constitution
of
the
pacific
Pickle
,
whose
bowels
yearned
with
apprehension
,
and
underwent
such
violent
agitation
on
the
spot
,
that
one
would
have
thought
the
operation
proceeded
from
some
severe
joke
of
the
apothecary
which
he
had
swallowed
in
his
beer
.
    
<EOS>
The
messenger
despairing
of
a
satisfactory
answer
,
left
him
in
this
woeful
condition
;
and
being
loath
to
lose
any
opportunity
of
raising
the
laugh
against
the
commodore
,
went
immediately
and
communicated
the
whole
affair
to
the
young
gentlemen
,
intreating
them
,
for
the
love
of
God
,
to
concert
some
means
of
bringing
old
Hannibal
into
the
field
.
<EOS>
The
two
friends
relished
the
proposal
,
and
after
some
deliberation
,
it
was
resolved
that
Hatchway
should
tell
Trunnion
his
invitation
was
accepted
by
Gamaliel
,
who
would
meet
him
at
the
place
appointed
,
with
his
second
,
to
-
morrow
in
the
twilight
,
because
if
either
should
fall
,
the
other
would
have
the
better
chance
for
escaping
in
the
dark
;
that
Godfrey
should
personate
old
Pickle
's
friend
,
and
Peregrine
represent
his
own
father
,
while
the
lieutenant
should
take
care
in
loading
the
pistols
to
keep
out
the
shot
,
so
as
that
no
damage
might
be
done
in
the
rencounter
.
    
<EOS>
These
circumstances
being
adjusted
,
the
lieutenant
returned
to
his
principal
with
a
most
thundering
reply
from
his
antagonist
,
whose
courageous
behaviour
,
though
it
could
not
intimidate
,
did
not
fail
to
astonish
the
commodore
,
who
ascribed
it
to
the
spirit
of
his
wife
,
which
had
inspired
him
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
that
instant
desired
his
counsellor
to
prepare
his
cartridge
-
box
,
and
order
the
quietest
horse
in
the
stable
to
be
kept
ready
saddled
for
the
occasion
;
his
eye
seemed
to
lighten
with
alacrity
and
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
smelling
gun
-
powder
once
more
before
his
death
;
and
when
Jack
advised
him
to
make
his
will
,
in
case
of
accident
,
he
rejected
his
counsel
with
disdain
,
saying
,
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
dost
think
that
Hawser
Trunnion
,
who
has
stood
the
fire
of
so
many
floating
batteries
,
runs
any
risk
from
the
lousy
pops
of
a
land
-
man
?
<EOS>
Thou
shalt
see
,
thou
shalt
see
how
I
will
make
him
lower
his
top
-
sails
.
<EOS>
"
Next
day
Peregrine
and
the
soldier
provided
themselves
with
horses
at
the
public
house
,
from
whence
,
at
the
destined
hour
,
they
rode
to
the
field
of
battle
,
each
of
them
being
muffled
in
a
great
coat
,
which
,
with
the
dimness
of
the
light
,
effectually
shielded
them
from
the
knowledge
of
the
one
-
eyed
commander
,
who
having
taken
horse
,
on
pretence
of
enjoying
the
fresh
air
,
soon
appeared
with
Hatchway
in
his
rear
.
<EOS>
When
they
came
within
sight
of
each
other
,
the
seconds
advanced
,
in
order
to
divide
the
ground
,
and
regulate
the
measures
of
the
combat
;
when
it
was
determined
by
mutual
consent
,
that
two
pistols
should
be
discharged
on
each
side
,
and
that
if
neither
should
prove
decisive
,
recourse
must
be
had
to
the
broad
-
swords
,
in
order
to
ascertain
the
victory
.
<EOS>
These
articles
being
settled
,
the
opponents
rode
forward
to
their
respective
stations
,
when
Peregrine
cocking
his
pistol
,
and
presenting
,
counterfeited
his
father
's
voice
,
and
bad
Trunnion
take
care
of
his
remaining
eye
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
took
his
advice
,
being
unwilling
to
hazard
his
day
-
light
,
and
very
deliberately
opposed
the
patched
side
of
his
face
to
the
muzzle
of
his
antagonist
's
piece
,
desiring
him
to
do
his
duty
without
further
jaw
.
    
<EOS>
The
young
man
accordingly
fired
,
and
the
distance
being
small
,
the
wad
of
his
pistol
took
place
with
a
smart
stroke
on
the
forehead
of
Trunnion
,
who
mistaking
it
for
the
ball
,
which
he
thought
was
lodged
in
his
brain
,
spurred
up
his
steed
in
a
state
of
desperation
towards
his
antagonist
,
and
holding
his
piece
within
two
yards
of
his
body
,
let
it
off
,
without
any
regard
to
the
laws
of
battle
.
<EOS>
Surprised
and
enraged
to
see
it
had
made
no
impression
,
he
hollowed
in
a
terrible
tone
,
"
O
!
<EOS>
damn
ye
,
you
have
got
your
netting
stuffed
,
I
see
;
"
and
advancing
,
discharged
his
second
pistol
so
near
his
godson
's
head
,
that
had
he
not
been
defended
by
his
great
coat
,
the
powder
must
have
scorched
his
face
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
thrown
away
his
fire
,
he
remained
at
the
mercy
of
Peregrine
,
who
clapping
the
piece
he
had
in
reserve
to
his
head
,
commanded
him
to
beg
his
life
,
and
ask
pardon
for
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
The
commodore
made
no
reply
to
this
imperious
injunction
,
but
dropping
his
pistol
,
and
unsheathing
his
broad
-
sword
with
a
jirk
,
attacked
our
hero
with
such
incredible
agility
,
that
if
he
had
not
made
shift
to
ward
off
the
stroke
with
his
piece
,
the
adventure
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
have
turned
out
a
very
tragical
joke
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
finding
it
would
be
in
vain
for
him
to
think
of
drawing
his
weapon
,
and
standing
on
the
defensive
against
this
furious
aggressor
,
very
fairly
clapt
spurs
to
his
nag
,
and
sought
his
safety
in
flight
.
<EOS>
Trunnion
pursued
him
with
infinite
eagerness
,
and
his
steed
being
the
better
of
the
two
,
would
have
overtaken
the
fugitive
to
his
peril
,
had
he
not
been
unfortunately
encountered
by
the
boughs
of
a
tree
that
happened
to
stand
on
his
blind
side
,
and
incommoded
him
so
much
,
that
he
was
fain
to
quit
his
sword
,
and
lay
hold
on
the
mane
,
in
order
to
maintain
his
seat
.
    
<EOS>
Perry
perceiving
his
disaster
,
wheeled
about
,
and
now
finding
leisure
to
produce
his
weapon
,
returned
upon
his
disarmed
foe
,
and
brandishing
his
Ferrara
,
<EOS>
threatened
to
make
him
shorter
by
the
head
,
if
he
would
not
immediately
crave
quarter
,
and
yield
.
<EOS>
There
was
nothing
farther
from
the
intention
of
the
old
gentleman
than
such
submission
,
which
he
flatly
refused
to
pay
,
alledging
that
he
had
already
compelled
his
enemy
to
clap
on
all
his
sails
,
and
that
his
own
present
misfortune
was
owing
to
accident
,
all
one
as
if
a
ship
should
be
attacked
,
after
she
had
been
obliged
to
heave
her
guns
over
-
board
in
a
storm
.
    
<EOS>
Before
Peregrine
had
time
to
answer
this
remonstrance
,
the
lieutenant
interposed
,
and
taking
cognizance
of
the
case
,
established
a
truce
,
until
he
and
the
other
second
should
discuss
and
decide
upon
the
merits
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
retired
to
a
small
distance
,
and
after
having
conferred
a
few
minutes
,
Hatchway
returned
,
and
pronounced
the
commodore
vanquished
by
the
chance
of
war
.
    
<EOS>
Never
was
rage
more
transporting
than
that
which
took
possession
of
old
Hannibal
,
when
he
heard
the
sentence
;
it
was
some
time
before
he
could
utter
aught
,
except
the
reproachful
expression
,
You
lie
!
<EOS>
which
he
repeated
more
than
twenty
times
,
in
a
sort
of
delirious
insensibility
;
and
when
he
recovered
the
further
use
of
speech
,
abused
the
arbitrators
with
such
bitter
invectives
,
renouncing
their
sentence
,
and
appealing
to
another
trial
,
that
the
confederates
began
to
repent
of
having
carried
the
joke
so
far
;
and
Peregrine
,
in
order
to
appease
his
choler
,
owned
himself
overcome
.
    
<EOS>
This
acknowledgement
calmed
the
tumult
of
his
wrath
,
though
he
could
not
for
some
days
forgive
the
lieutenant
;
and
the
two
young
gentlemen
rode
back
to
Tunley
's
,
while
Hatchway
,
taking
the
commodore
's
horse
by
the
bridle
,
reconducted
him
to
his
mansion
,
growling
all
the
way
at
Jack
for
his
unjust
and
unfriendly
decree
;
though
he
could
not
help
observing
,
as
how
he
had
made
his
words
good
,
in
making
his
adversary
strike
his
top
-
sails
:
"
<EOS>
And
yet
(
said
he
)
before
God
!
<EOS>
I
think
the
fellow
's
head
is
made
of
a
wool
-
pack
;
for
my
shot
rebounded
from
his
face
like
a
wad
of
spun
-
yarn
from
the
walls
of
a
ship
.
<EOS>
But
if
so
be
that
son
of
a
bitch
of
a
tree
had
n't
come
athwart
my
weather
-
bow
,
d'ye
<EOS>
see
,
I
'll
be
damned
if
I
had
n't
snapt
his
main
-
yard
in
the
slings
,
and
mayhap
let
out
his
bulge
-
water
into
the
bargain
.
"
<EOS>
He
seemed
particularly
vain
of
this
exploit
,
which
dwelt
upon
his
imagination
,
and
was
cherished
as
the
child
of
his
old
age
;
for
though
he
could
not
with
decency
rehearse
it
to
the
young
men
and
his
wife
at
supper
,
he
gave
shrewd
hints
of
his
own
manhood
,
even
at
these
years
,
and
attested
Hatchway
as
a
voucher
for
his
mettle
,
while
the
triumvirate
,
diverted
by
his
vanity
,
enjoyed
in
secret
the
success
of
their
imposition
.

Chapter
XXXVII
Peregrine
takes
leave
of
his
aunt
and
sister
,
sets
out
from
the
garison
,
parts
with
his
uncle
and
Hatchway
on
the
road
,
and
with
his
governor
arrives
in
safety
at
Dover
.
   
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
the
last
effort
of
invention
which
they
practised
upon
him
;
and
every
thing
being
now
prepared
for
the
departure
of
his
godson
,
that
hopeful
youth
in
two
days
took
leave
of
all
his
friends
in
the
neighbourhood
,
was
closeted
two
whole
hours
with
his
aunt
,
who
inriched
him
with
many
pious
advices
,
recapitulated
all
the
benefits
which
,
through
her
means
,
had
been
conferred
upon
him
since
his
infancy
,
cautioned
him
against
the
temptations
of
lewd
women
,
who
bring
many
a
man
to
a
morsel
of
bread
,
laid
strict
injunctions
upon
him
,
to
live
in
the
fear
of
the
Lord
and
the
true
protestant
faith
,
to
eschew
quarrels
and
contention
,
to
treat
Mr
Jolter
with
reverence
and
regard
,
and
above
all
things
to
abstain
from
the
beastly
sin
of
drunkenness
,
which
exposeth
a
man
to
the
scorn
and
contempt
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
,
and
by
divesting
him
of
reason
and
reflection
,
renders
him
fit
for
all
manner
of
vice
and
debauchery
.
<EOS>
She
recommended
to
him
oeconomy
and
the
care
of
his
health
,
bad
him
remember
the
honour
of
his
family
,
and
in
all
the
circumstances
of
his
behaviour
,
assured
him
,
that
he
might
always
depend
upon
the
friendship
and
generosity
of
the
commodore
;
and
finally
,
presenting
him
with
her
own
picture
set
in
gold
,
and
an
hundred
guineas
from
her
privy
purse
,
embraced
him
affectionately
,
and
wished
him
all
manner
of
happiness
and
prosperity
.
    
<EOS>
Being
thus
kindly
dismissed
by
Mrs
Trunnion
,
he
locked
himself
up
with
his
sister
Julia
,
whom
he
admonished
to
cultivate
her
aunt
with
the
most
complaisant
and
respectful
attention
,
without
stooping
to
any
circumstance
of
submission
that
she
should
judge
unworthy
of
her
practice
;
he
protested
,
that
his
chief
study
should
be
to
make
her
amends
for
the
privilege
she
had
forfeited
by
her
affection
for
him
;
intreated
her
to
enter
into
no
engagement
without
his
knowledge
and
approbation
,
put
into
her
hand
the
purse
which
he
had
received
from
his
aunt
,
to
defray
her
pocket
expences
in
his
absence
,
and
parted
from
her
,
not
without
tears
,
after
she
had
for
some
minutes
hung
about
his
neck
,
kissing
him
and
weeping
in
the
most
pathetic
silence
.
    
<EOS>
Having
performed
these
duties
of
affection
and
consanguinity
over
-
night
,
he
went
to
bed
,
and
was
by
his
own
direction
,
called
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
he
found
the
post
-
chaise
,
coach
and
riding
-
horses
ready
at
the
gate
,
his
friends
Gauntlet
and
Hatchway
on
foot
,
the
commodore
himself
almost
dressed
,
and
every
servant
in
the
garison
assembled
in
the
yard
,
to
wish
him
a
good
journey
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
shook
each
of
these
humble
friends
by
the
hand
,
tipping
them
at
the
same
time
with
marks
of
his
bounty
;
and
was
very
much
surprized
when
he
could
not
perceive
his
old
attendant
Pipes
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
When
he
expressed
his
wonder
at
this
disrespectful
omission
of
Tom
,
some
of
those
present
ran
to
his
chamber
,
in
order
to
give
him
a
call
,
but
his
hammock
and
room
were
both
deserted
,
and
they
soon
returned
with
an
account
of
his
having
eloped
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
disturbed
at
this
information
,
believing
that
the
fellow
had
taken
some
desperate
course
,
in
consequence
of
his
being
dismissed
from
his
service
,
and
began
to
wish
that
he
had
indulged
his
inclination
,
by
retaining
him
still
about
his
person
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
there
was
now
no
other
remedy
,
he
recommended
him
strenuously
to
the
particular
favour
and
distinction
of
his
uncle
and
Hatchway
,
in
case
he
should
appear
again
;
and
as
he
went
out
at
the
gate
,
was
saluted
with
three
chears
by
all
the
domestics
in
the
family
.
    
<EOS>
The
commodore
,
Gauntlet
,
lieutenant
,
Peregrine
and
Jolter
went
into
the
coach
together
,
that
they
might
enjoy
each
other
's
conversation
as
much
as
possible
,
resolving
to
breakfast
at
an
inn
upon
the
road
,
where
Trunnion
and
Hatchway
intended
to
bid
our
adventurer
farewel
;
the
valet
de
chambre
got
into
the
post
-
chaise
,
the
French
lacquey
rode
one
horse
and
led
another
,
one
of
the
valets
of
the
garison
mounted
at
the
back
of
the
coach
;
and
thus
the
cavalcade
set
out
on
the
road
to
Dover
.
<EOS>
As
the
commodore
could
not
bear
the
fatigue
of
jolting
,
they
travelled
at
an
easy
pace
during
the
first
stage
;
so
that
the
old
gentleman
had
an
opportunity
of
communicating
his
exhortations
to
his
godson
,
with
regard
to
his
conduct
abroad
<EOS>
;
he
advised
him
,
now
that
he
was
going
into
foreign
parts
,
to
be
upon
his
guard
against
the
fair
weather
of
the
French
politesse
,
which
was
no
more
to
be
trusted
than
a
whirlpool
at
sea
.
<EOS>
He
observed
that
many
young
men
had
gone
to
Paris
with
good
cargoes
of
sense
,
and
returned
with
a
great
deal
of
canvas
,
and
no
ballast
at
all
,
whereby
they
became
crank
all
the
days
of
their
lives
,
and
sometimes
carried
their
keels
above
water
.
<EOS>
He
desired
Mr
Jolter
to
keep
his
pupil
out
of
the
clutches
of
those
sharking
priests
who
lie
in
wait
to
make
converts
of
all
young
strangers
,
and
in
a
particular
manner
cautioned
the
youth
against
carnal
conversation
with
the
Parisian
dames
,
who
,
he
understood
,
were
no
better
than
gaudy
fire
-
ships
ready
primed
with
death
and
destruction
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
listened
with
great
respect
,
thanking
him
for
his
kind
admonitions
,
which
he
faithfully
promised
to
observe
.
<EOS>
They
halted
and
breakfasted
at
the
end
of
the
stage
,
where
Jolter
provided
himself
with
a
horse
,
and
the
commodore
settled
the
method
of
corresponding
with
his
nephew
;
and
the
minute
of
parting
being
arrived
,
the
old
commander
wrung
his
godson
by
the
hand
,
saying
,
"
I
wish
thee
a
prosperous
voyage
and
good
cheer
,
my
lad
;
my
timbers
are
now
a
little
crazy
,
d'ye
see
;
and
God
knows
if
I
shall
keep
afloat
till
such
time
as
I
see
thee
again
;
but
,
howsomever
,
<EOS>
hap
<EOS>
what
will
,
thou
wilt
find
thyself
in
a
condition
to
keep
in
the
line
with
the
best
of
thy
fellows
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
then
reminded
Gauntlet
of
his
promise
to
call
at
the
garison
in
his
return
from
Dover
,
and
imparted
something
in
a
whisper
to
the
governor
,
while
Jack
Hatchway
unable
to
speak
,
pulled
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
and
squeezing
Peregrine
by
the
hand
,
gave
him
an
iron
pistol
of
curious
workmanship
,
as
a
memorial
of
his
friendship
.
<EOS>
Our
youth
,
who
was
not
unmoved
on
this
occasion
,
received
the
pledge
,
which
he
acknowledged
with
the
present
of
a
silver
tobacco
-
box
,
that
he
had
bought
for
that
purpose
;
and
the
two
lads
of
the
castle
getting
into
the
coach
,
were
driven
homewards
,
in
a
state
of
silent
dejection
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
and
Peregrine
seated
themselves
in
the
post
-
chaise
,
and
Jolter
,
the
valet
de
chambre
and
lacquey
bestriding
their
beasts
,
they
proceeded
for
the
place
of
their
destination
,
at
which
they
arrived
in
safety
that
same
night
,
and
bespoke
a
passage
in
the
pacquet
-
boat
which
was
to
sail
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XXXVIII
<EOS>
He
adjusts
the
method
of
his
correspondence
with
Gauntlet
;
meets
by
accident
with
an
Italian
Charlatan
,
and
a
certain
apothecary
,
who
proves
to
be
a
noted
character
.
   
<EOS>
There
the
two
friends
adjusted
the
articles
of
their
future
correspondence
,
and
Peregrine
having
written
a
letter
to
his
mistress
,
wherein
he
renewed
his
former
vows
of
eternal
fidelity
,
it
was
intrusted
to
the
care
of
her
brother
,
while
Mr
Jolter
,
at
the
desire
of
his
pupil
,
provided
an
elegant
supper
,
and
some
excellent
Burgundy
,
that
they
might
spend
this
eve
of
his
departure
with
the
greater
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
Things
being
thus
disposed
,
and
a
servant
employed
in
laying
the
cloth
,
their
ears
were
of
a
sudden
invaded
by
a
strange
tumultuous
noise
in
the
next
room
,
occasioned
by
the
overthrow
of
tables
,
chairs
and
glasses
,
with
odd
unintelligible
exclamations
in
broken
French
,
and
a
jargon
of
threats
in
the
Welsh
dialect
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentlemen
ran
immediately
into
the
apartment
from
whence
this
clamour
seemed
to
proceed
,
and
found
a
thin
meagre
swarthy
figure
gasping
in
all
the
agony
of
fear
,
under
the
hands
of
a
squat
,
thick
,
hard
-
featured
man
,
who
collared
him
with
great
demonstrations
of
wrath
,
saying
,
"
If
you
was
as
mighty
a
magician
as
Owen
Glendower
,
or
the
witch
of
Entor
,
look
you
,
ay
,
or
as
Paul
Beor
himself
,
I
will
make
pold
,
by
the
assistance
of
Got
,
and
in
his
Majesty
's
naam
,
to
seize
and
secure
,
and
confine
and
confront
you
,
until
such
time
as
you
suffer
and
endure
and
undergo
the
pains
and
penalties
of
the
law
,
for
your
diabolical
practices
.
<EOS>
Shentlemens
,
added
he
,
turning
to
our
adventurers
,
I
take
you
to
witness
that
I
protest
and
assert
and
avow
that
this
person
is
as
pig
a
necromancer
as
you
would
desire
to
behold
;
and
I
supplicate
and
beseech
and
intreat
of
you
,
that
he
may
be
<EOS>
prought
pefore
his
petters
,
and
compelled
to
give
an
account
of
his
compact
and
commerce
with
the
imps
of
darkness
,
look
you
;
for
as
I
am
a
christian
soul
,
and
hope
for
joyful
resurrection
<EOS>
,
I
have
this
plessed
evening
seen
him
perform
such
things
as
could
not
be
done
without
the
aid
and
instruction
and
connivance
of
the
Tevil
.
"
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
seemed
to
enter
into
the
sentiments
of
this
Welch
reformer
,
and
actually
laid
hold
on
the
delinquent
's
shoulder
,
crying
,
"
Damn
the
rascal
!
<EOS>
I
'll
lay
any
wager
that
he
's
a
jesuit
;
for
none
of
his
order
travel
without
a
familiar
.
"
    
<EOS>
But
Peregrine
,
who
looked
upon
the
affair
in
another
point
of
view
,
interposed
in
behalf
of
the
stranger
,
whom
he
freed
from
his
aggressors
,
observing
that
there
was
no
occasion
to
use
violence
,
and
asked
in
French
what
he
had
done
to
incur
the
censure
of
the
informer
.
<EOS>
The
poor
foreigner
,
more
dead
than
alive
,
answered
that
he
was
an
Italian
charlatan
,
who
had
practised
with
some
reputation
in
Padua
,
until
he
had
the
misfortune
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
Inquisition
,
by
exhibiting
certain
wonderful
performances
by
his
skill
in
natural
knowledge
,
which
that
tribunal
considered
as
the
effects
of
sorcery
,
and
persecuted
him
accordingly
;
so
that
he
had
been
fain
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
into
France
,
where
not
finding
his
account
in
his
talents
,
he
was
now
arrived
in
England
,
with
a
view
of
practising
his
art
in
London
;
and
that
in
consequence
of
a
specimen
which
he
had
given
to
a
company
below
,
the
choleric
gentleman
had
followed
him
up
stairs
to
his
own
apartment
,
and
assaulted
him
in
that
inhospitable
manner
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
earnestly
begged
that
our
hero
would
take
him
under
his
protection
;
and
if
he
entertained
the
least
suspicion
of
his
employing
preternatural
means
in
the
operations
of
his
art
,
he
would
freely
communicate
all
the
secrets
in
his
possession
.
    
<EOS>
The
youth
dispelled
his
apprehension
,
by
assuring
him
that
he
was
in
no
danger
of
suffering
for
his
art
in
England
,
where
,
if
ever
he
should
be
questioned
by
the
zeal
of
superstitious
individuals
,
he
had
nothing
to
do
but
appeal
to
the
next
justice
of
the
peace
,
who
would
immediately
acquit
him
of
the
charge
,
and
punish
his
accusers
for
their
impertinence
and
indiscretion
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
told
Gauntlet
and
the
Welshman
,
that
the
stranger
had
a
good
action
against
them
for
an
assault
,
by
virtue
of
an
act
of
parliament
,
which
makes
it
criminal
for
any
person
to
accuse
another
of
sorcery
and
witchcraft
,
these
idle
notions
being
now
justly
exploded
by
all
sensible
men
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
who
had
by
this
time
joined
the
company
,
could
not
help
signifying
his
dissent
from
this
opinion
of
his
pupil
,
which
he
endeavoured
to
invalidate
by
the
authority
of
scripture
,
quotations
from
the
fathers
,
and
the
confession
of
many
wretches
who
suffered
death
for
having
carried
on
correspondence
with
evil
spirits
,
together
with
the
evidence
of
Satan
's
Invisible
World
,
and
Moreton
's
history
of
witchcraft
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
corroborated
these
testimonies
by
facts
that
had
happened
within
the
sphere
of
his
own
knowledge
,
and
in
particular
mentioned
the
case
of
an
old
woman
of
the
parish
in
which
he
was
born
,
who
used
to
transform
herself
into
the
shapes
of
sundry
animals
,
and
was
at
last
killed
by
small
-
shot
,
in
the
character
of
an
hare
.
    
<EOS>
The
Welchman
thus
supported
,
expressed
his
surprize
at
hearing
that
the
legislature
had
shewn
such
tenderness
for
criminals
of
so
dark
a
hue
;
and
offered
to
prove
by
undeniable
instances
,
that
there
was
not
a
mountain
in
Wales
,
which
had
not
been
in
his
memory
the
scene
of
necromancy
and
witchcraft
;
"
Wherefore
,
said
he
,
I
am
assuredly
more
than
apove
astonished
and
confounded
and
concerned
,
that
the
parliament
of
Great
Pritain
should
in
their
great
wisdoms
and
their
prudence
,
and
their
penetration
,
give
countenance
and
encouragement
,
look
you
,
to
the
works
of
darkness
and
the
empire
of
Pelzepup
;
ofer
and
apove
the
evidence
of
holy
writ
,
and
those
writers
who
have
been
quoted
by
that
aggurate
and
learned
shentleman
,
we
are
informed
by
profane
history
,
of
the
pribbles
and
pranks
of
the
old
serpent
,
in
the
bortents
and
oragles
of
antiquity
;
as
you
will
find
in
that
most
excellent
historian
Bolypius
,
and
Titus
Lifius
;
ay
,
and
moreofer
,
in
the
commentaries
of
Julius
Caesar
himself
,
who
,
as
the
'
ole
'
orld
knows
,
was
a
most
famous
,
and
a
most
faliant
,
and
a
most
wise
,
and
a
most
prudent
,
and
a
most
fortunate
cheiftan
,
and
a
most
renowned
orator
;
ay
,
and
a
most
elegant
writer
to
boot
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
did
not
think
proper
to
enter
the
lists
of
dispute
with
three
such
obstinate
antagonists
;
but
contented
himself
with
saying
,
that
he
believed
it
would
be
no
difficult
matter
to
impugn
the
arguments
they
had
advanced
;
though
he
did
not
find
himself
at
all
disposed
to
undertake
the
task
,
which
must
of
course
break
in
upon
the
evening
's
entertainment
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
invited
the
Italian
to
supper
,
and
asked
the
same
favour
of
his
accuser
,
who
seemed
to
have
something
curious
and
characteristic
in
his
manner
and
disposition
,
resolving
to
make
himself
an
eye
-
witness
of
those
surprising
feats
,
which
had
given
offence
to
the
choleric
Briton
.
<EOS>
This
scrupulous
gentleman
thanked
our
hero
for
his
courtesy
,
but
declined
communicating
with
the
stranger
,
until
his
character
should
be
further
explained
;
upon
which
his
inviter
,
after
some
conversation
with
the
charlatan
,
assured
him
that
he
would
himself
undertake
for
the
innocence
of
his
art
;
and
then
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
favour
them
with
his
company
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
the
conversation
,
Peregrine
learnt
that
the
Welchman
was
a
surgeon
of
Canterbury
,
who
had
been
called
in
to
a
consultation
at
Dover
,
and
understanding
that
his
name
was
Morgan
,
took
the
liberty
of
asking
if
he
was
not
the
person
so
respectfully
mentioned
in
the
Adventures
of
Roderick
Random
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Morgan
assumed
a
look
of
gravity
and
importance
at
this
interrogation
,
and
screwing
up
his
mouth
,
answered
,
"
Mr
Rantum
,
my
goot
sir
,
I
believe
upon
my
conscience
and
salfation
,
is
my
very
goot
frient
and
wellwisher
;
and
he
and
I
have
been
companions
and
messmates
and
fellow
-
sufferers
,
look
you
;
but
nevertheless
,
for
all
that
,
peradventure
,
he
hath
not
pehaved
with
so
much
complaisance
and
affability
and
respect
,
as
I
might
have
expected
from
him
;
pecause
he
hath
revealed
and
tivulged
and
buplished
our
private
affairs
,
without
my
knowledge
and
privity
and
consent
;
but
as
Got
is
my
safiour
,
I
think
he
had
no
evil
intention
in
his
pelly
;
and
though
there
be
certain
persons
,
look
you
,
who
,
as
I
am
told
,
take
upon
them
to
laugh
at
his
descriptions
of
my
person
,
deportment
and
conversation
,
I
do
affirm
and
maintain
,
and
insist
with
my
heart
,
and
my
plood
and
my
soul
,
that
those
persons
are
no
petter
than
ignorant
asses
,
and
that
they
know
not
how
to
discern
and
distinguish
and
define
true
ridicule
,
or
as
Aristotle
calls
it
,
the
to
geloion
,
no
more
,
look
you
,
than
a
herd
of
mountain
goats
;
for
I
will
make
pold
to
observe
,
and
I
hope
this
goot
company
will
be
of
the
same
opinion
,
that
there
is
nothing
said
of
me
in
that
performance
,
which
is
unworthy
of
a
christian
and
a
shentleman
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
and
his
friends
acquiesced
in
the
justness
of
his
observation
,
and
Peregrine
particularly
assured
him
,
that
from
reading
the
book
,
he
had
conceived
the
utmost
regard
and
veneration
for
his
character
;
and
that
he
thought
himself
extremely
fortunate
in
having
this
opportunity
of
enjoying
his
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
Morgan
,
not
a
little
proud
of
such
advances
from
a
person
of
Peregrine
's
appearance
,
returned
the
compliment
with
a
profusion
of
civility
,
and
in
the
warmth
of
acknowledgement
,
expressed
a
desire
of
seeing
him
and
his
company
at
his
house
in
Canterbury
:
"
I
will
not
pretend
,
or
presume
,
kind
sir
,
said
he
,
to
entertain
you
according
to
your
merits
and
deserts
;
but
you
shall
be
as
welcome
to
my
poor
cottage
,
and
my
wife
and
family
,
as
the
Prince
of
Wales
himself
;
and
it
shall
go
hard
,
if
one
way
or
other
,
I
do
not
find
ways
and
means
of
making
you
confess
that
there
is
some
goot
fellowship
in
an
ancient
Priton
:
for
though
I
am
no
petter
than
a
simple
apothecary
<EOS>
,
I
have
as
goot
plood
circulating
in
my
veins
,
as
any
he
in
the
county
;
and
I
can
describe
and
delineate
and
demonstrate
my
pedigree
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
'
ole
'
orld
;
and
moreofer
,
by
Got
's
goot
providence
and
assistance
,
I
can
afford
to
treat
my
friend
with
a
joint
of
goot
mutton
,
and
a
pottle
of
excellent
wine
,
and
no
tradesman
can
peard
me
with
a
bill
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
He
was
congratulated
on
his
happy
situation
,
and
assured
that
our
youth
would
visit
him
on
his
return
from
France
,
provided
he
should
take
Canterbury
in
his
route
;
and
as
Peregrine
manifested
an
inclination
of
being
acquainted
with
the
state
of
his
affairs
,
he
very
complaisantly
satisfied
his
curiosity
,
by
giving
him
to
know
that
his
spouse
had
left
off
breeding
,
after
having
blessed
him
with
two
boys
and
a
girl
,
who
were
still
alive
and
well
;
that
he
lived
in
good
esteem
with
his
neighbours
,
and
by
his
practice
,
which
was
considerably
extended
immediately
after
the
publication
of
Roderick
Random
,
<EOS>
had
saved
some
thousand
pounds
,
and
begun
to
think
of
retiring
among
his
own
relations
in
Glamorganshire
,
where
he
had
already
pitched
upon
a
spot
for
his
residence
,
though
his
wife
had
made
objections
to
this
proposal
,
and
opposed
the
execution
of
it
with
such
obstinacy
,
that
he
had
been
at
infinite
pains
in
asserting
his
own
prerogative
,
by
convincing
her
both
from
reason
and
example
,
that
he
was
king
and
priest
in
his
own
family
,
and
that
she
owed
the
most
implicit
submission
to
his
will
:
he
likewise
informed
the
company
,
that
he
had
lately
seen
his
friend
Roderick
,
who
had
come
from
London
on
purpose
to
visit
him
,
after
having
gained
his
lawsuit
with
Mr
Topehall
,
who
was
obliged
to
pay
Narcissa
's
fortune
;
that
Mr
Random
,
in
all
appearance
,
led
a
very
happy
life
in
the
conversation
of
his
father
and
bedfellow
,
by
whom
he
enjoyed
a
son
and
daughter
;
and
that
Morgan
had
received
in
a
present
from
him
,
a
piece
of
very
fine
linnen
of
his
wife
's
own
making
,
several
kits
of
salmon
,
and
two
casks
of
pickled
pork
,
the
most
delicate
he
had
ever
tasted
;
together
with
a
barrel
of
excellent
herrings
for
salmagundy
,
which
he
knew
to
be
his
favourite
dish
.
    
<EOS>
This
topick
of
conversation
being
discussed
,
the
Italian
was
desired
to
exhibit
a
specimen
of
his
art
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
conducted
the
company
into
the
next
room
,
where
to
their
great
astonishment
and
affright
,
they
beheld
a
thousand
serpents
winding
along
the
cieling
.
<EOS>
Morgan
struck
with
this
phaenomenon
,
which
he
had
not
seen
before
,
began
to
utter
exorcisms
with
great
devotion
,
Mr
Jolter
ran
terrified
out
of
the
room
,
Gauntlet
drew
his
hanger
,
and
Peregrine
himself
was
disconcerted
.
<EOS>
The
operator
perceiving
their
confusion
,
desired
them
to
retire
,
and
calling
them
back
in
an
instant
,
there
was
not
a
viper
to
be
seen
.
    
<EOS>
He
raised
their
admiration
by
sundry
other
performances
,
and
the
Welchman
's
former
opinion
and
abhorrence
of
his
character
began
to
recur
,
when
in
consideration
of
the
civility
with
which
he
had
been
treated
,
this
Italian
imparted
to
them
all
the
methods
by
which
he
had
acted
such
wonders
,
that
were
no
other
than
the
effects
of
natural
causes
curiously
combined
;
so
that
Morgan
became
a
convert
to
his
skill
,
asked
pardon
for
the
suspicion
he
had
entertained
,
and
invited
the
stranger
to
pass
a
few
days
with
him
at
Canterbury
.
<EOS>
The
scruples
of
Godfrey
and
Jolter
were
removed
at
the
same
time
,
and
Peregrine
testified
his
satisfaction
by
an
handsome
gratuity
which
he
bestowed
upon
their
entertainer
.
    
<EOS>
The
evening
being
spent
in
this
sociable
manner
,
every
man
retired
to
his
respective
chamber
,
and
next
morning
they
breakfasted
together
,
when
Morgan
declared
he
would
stay
till
he
should
see
our
hero
fairly
embarked
,
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
Mr
Gauntlet
's
company
to
his
own
habitation
;
<EOS>
mean
while
,
by
the
skipper
's
advice
,
the
servants
were
ordered
to
carry
a
store
of
wine
and
provision
on
board
in
case
of
accident
;
and
as
the
packet
-
boat
could
not
sail
before
one
o'clock
,
the
company
walked
up
hill
to
visit
the
castle
,
where
they
saw
the
sword
of
Julius
Caesar
and
Queen
Elizabeth
's
pocket
pistol
,
repeated
Shakespear
's
description
,
while
they
surveyed
the
chalky
cliffs
on
each
side
,
and
cast
their
eyes
towards
the
city
of
Calais
,
that
was
obscured
by
a
thick
cloud
which
did
not
much
regale
their
eyesight
,
because
it
seemed
to
portend
foul
weather
.
   
<EOS>
Having
viewed
every
thing
remarkable
in
this
place
,
they
returned
to
the
pier
,
where
after
the
compliments
of
parting
,
and
an
affectionate
embrace
between
the
two
young
gentlemen
,
Peregrine
and
his
governor
stept
on
board
,
the
sails
were
hoisted
,
and
they
went
to
sea
with
a
fair
wind
,
while
Godfrey
,
Morgan
and
the
conjurer
walked
back
to
the
inn
,
from
whence
<EOS>
they
set
out
for
Canterbury
before
dinner
.

Chapter
XXXIX
<EOS>
He
embarks
for
France
;
is
overtaken
by
a
storm
;
is
surprised
with
the
appearance
of
Pipes
;
lands
at
Calais
,
and
has
an
affair
with
the
officers
of
the
custom
-
house
.
   
<EOS>
Scarce
had
the
vessel
proceeded
two
leagues
on
the
passage
,
when
the
wind
shifting
,
blew
directly
in
their
teeth
;
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
haul
upon
a
wind
,
and
alter
their
course
;
and
the
sea
running
pretty
high
at
the
same
time
,
our
hero
,
who
was
below
in
his
cabbin
,
began
to
be
squeamish
,
and
in
consequence
of
the
skipper
's
advice
,
went
upon
deck
for
the
comfort
of
his
stomach
;
while
the
governor
,
experienced
in
these
disasters
,
slipt
into
bed
,
where
he
lay
at
his
ease
,
amusing
himself
with
a
treatise
on
the
Cycloid
,
with
algebraical
demonstrations
,
which
never
failed
to
engage
his
imagination
in
the
most
agreeable
manner
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
the
wind
increased
to
a
very
hard
gale
,
the
vessel
pitched
with
great
violence
,
the
sea
washed
over
the
decks
,
the
master
was
alarmed
,
the
crew
were
confounded
,
the
passengers
were
overwhelmed
with
sickness
and
fear
,
and
universal
distraction
ensued
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
uproar
,
Peregrine
holding
fast
by
the
taffril
,
and
looking
ruefully
ahead
,
the
countenance
of
Pipes
presented
itself
to
his
astonished
view
,
rising
as
it
were
from
the
hold
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
At
first
he
imagined
it
was
a
fear
-
formed
shadow
of
his
own
brain
;
though
he
did
not
long
remain
in
this
error
,
but
plainly
perceived
that
it
was
no
other
than
the
real
person
of
Thomas
,
who
jumping
on
the
quarter
-
deck
,
took
charge
of
the
helm
,
and
dictated
to
the
sailors
with
as
much
authority
as
if
he
had
been
commander
of
the
ship
.
<EOS>
The
skipper
looked
upon
him
as
an
angel
sent
to
his
assistance
,
and
the
crew
soon
discovering
him
to
be
a
thorough
-
bred
seaman
,
notwithstanding
his
livery
-
frock
,
obeyed
his
orders
with
such
alacrity
that
in
a
little
time
the
confusion
vanished
,
and
every
necessary
step
taken
to
weather
the
gale
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
immediately
conceived
the
meaning
of
Tom
's
appearance
on
board
,
and
when
the
tumult
was
a
little
subsided
,
went
up
and
encouraged
him
to
exert
himself
for
the
preservation
of
the
ship
,
promising
to
take
him
again
into
his
service
,
from
which
he
should
never
be
dismissed
,
except
by
his
own
desire
.
    
<EOS>
This
assurance
had
a
surprising
effect
upon
Pipes
,
who
,
though
he
made
no
manner
of
reply
,
thrust
the
helm
into
the
master
's
hand
,
saying
,
"
Here
,
you
old
bum
-
boat
woman
,
take
hold
of
the
tiller
,
and
keep
her
thus
,
boy
,
thus
;
"
and
skipped
about
the
vessel
,
trimming
the
sails
,
and
managing
the
ropes
with
such
agility
and
skill
,
that
every
body
on
deck
stood
amazed
at
his
dexterity
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
was
far
from
being
unconcerned
at
the
uncommon
motion
of
the
vessel
,
the
singing
of
the
wind
,
and
the
uproar
which
he
heard
above
him
;
he
looked
towards
the
cabbin
-
door
with
the
most
wishful
expectation
,
in
hope
of
seeing
some
person
who
could
give
some
account
of
the
weather
,
and
what
was
doing
upon
deck
;
but
not
a
soul
appeared
,
and
he
was
too
well
acquainted
with
the
disposition
of
his
own
bowels
to
alter
his
own
attitude
in
the
least
.
<EOS>
When
he
had
lain
a
good
while
in
all
the
agony
of
suspence
,
the
boy
tumbled
headlong
into
his
apartment
with
such
noisy
ruin
,
that
he
believed
the
mast
had
gone
by
the
board
,
and
starting
upright
in
his
bed
,
asked
with
all
the
symptoms
of
horror
,
what
was
the
cause
of
that
disturbance
?
<EOS>
The
boy
,
half
stunned
by
his
fall
,
answered
in
a
dolorous
tone
,
"
I
'm
come
to
put
up
the
dead
-
lights
.
"
    
<EOS>
At
the
mention
of
dead
-
lights
,
the
meaning
of
which
he
did
not
understand
,
the
poor
governor
's
heart
died
within
him
;
he
shivered
with
despair
,
and
his
recollection
forsaking
him
,
he
fell
upon
his
knees
in
the
bed
,
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
the
book
which
was
in
his
hand
,
began
to
pronounce
aloud
,
with
great
fervor
,
"
The
time
of
a
compleat
oscillation
in
the
cycloid
,
is
to
the
time
in
which
a
body
would
fall
through
the
axis
of
the
cycloid
DV
,
as
the
circumference
of
a
circle
to
its
diameter
 
<EOS>
"
He
would
in
all
likelihood
have
proceeded
with
the
demonstration
of
this
proposition
,
had
he
not
been
seized
with
such
a
qualm
as
compelled
him
to
drop
the
book
,
and
accommodate
himself
to
the
emergency
of
his
distemper
;
he
therefore
stretched
himself
at
full
length
,
and
putting
up
ejaculations
to
heaven
,
began
to
prepare
himself
for
his
latter
end
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
noise
above
was
intermitted
;
and
as
he
could
not
conceive
the
cause
of
this
tremendous
silence
,
he
imagined
that
either
the
men
were
washed
overboard
,
or
that
despairing
of
safety
,
they
had
ceased
to
oppose
the
tempest
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
harrowed
by
this
miserable
incertainty
,
which
,
however
,
was
not
altogether
unenlightened
by
some
scattered
rays
of
hope
,
the
master
entered
the
cabbin
,
and
he
asked
with
a
voice
half
extinguished
by
fear
,
how
matters
went
upon
deck
?
<EOS>
The
skipper
,
with
a
large
bottle
of
brandy
applied
to
his
mouth
,
answered
in
a
hollow
tone
,
"
All
's
over
now
,
master
.
"
<EOS>
Upon
which
Mr
Jolter
,
giving
himself
over
for
lost
,
exclaimed
with
the
utmost
horror
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
Christ
have
mercy
upon
us
!
"
and
repeated
this
supplication
as
it
were
mechanically
,
until
the
master
undeceived
him
,
by
explaining
the
meaning
of
what
he
had
said
,
and
assuring
him
that
the
squall
was
over
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
sudden
transition
from
fear
to
joy
,
occasioned
a
violent
agitation
both
in
his
mind
and
body
;
and
it
was
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
recovered
the
right
use
of
his
organs
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
weather
cleared
up
,
the
wind
began
to
blow
again
from
the
right
corner
,
and
the
spires
of
Calais
appeared
at
the
distance
of
five
leagues
;
so
that
the
countenances
of
all
on
board
were
lighted
up
with
joyous
expectation
;
and
Peregrine
venturing
to
go
down
into
the
cabbin
,
comforted
his
governor
with
an
account
of
the
happy
turn
of
their
affairs
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
transported
with
the
thought
of
a
speedy
landing
,
began
to
launch
out
in
praise
of
that
country
for
which
they
were
bound
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
France
was
the
land
of
politeness
and
hospitality
,
which
were
conspicuous
in
the
behaviour
of
all
ranks
and
degrees
,
from
the
peer
to
the
peasant
;
that
a
gentleman
and
a
foreigner
,
far
from
being
insulted
and
imposed
upon
by
the
lower
class
of
people
,
as
in
England
,
was
treated
with
the
utmost
reverence
,
candour
and
respect
;
that
their
fields
were
fertile
,
their
climate
pure
and
healthy
,
their
farmers
rich
and
industrious
,
and
the
subjects
in
general
the
happiest
of
men
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
prosecuted
this
favourite
theme
still
farther
,
had
not
his
pupil
been
obliged
to
run
upon
deck
,
in
consequence
of
certain
warnings
he
received
from
his
stomach
.
    
<EOS>
The
skipper
seeing
his
condition
,
very
honestly
reminded
him
of
the
cold
ham
and
fowls
,
with
a
basket
of
wine
,
which
he
had
ordered
to
be
sent
on
board
,
and
asked
if
he
would
have
the
cloth
laid
below
.
<EOS>
He
could
not
have
chosen
a
more
seasonable
opportunity
of
manifesting
his
own
disinterestedness
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
made
wry
faces
at
the
mention
of
food
,
bidding
him
,
for
Christ
's
sake
,
talk
no
more
on
that
subject
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
descended
into
the
cabbin
,
and
put
the
same
question
to
Mr
Jolter
,
who
,
he
knew
,
entertained
the
same
abhorrence
for
his
proposal
;
and
meeting
with
the
like
reception
from
him
,
went
between
decks
,
and
repeated
his
courteous
proffer
to
the
valet
de
chambre
and
lacquey
,
who
lay
sprawling
in
all
the
pangs
of
a
double
evacuation
,
and
rejected
his
civility
with
the
most
horrible
loathing
.
<EOS>
Thus
baffled
in
all
his
kind
endeavours
,
he
ordered
his
boy
to
secure
the
provision
in
one
of
his
own
lockers
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
ship
;
and
he
would
have
enjoyed
a
pretty
comfortable
booty
,
had
not
Pipes
interposed
,
and
divided
the
store
among
the
sailors
,
who
,
he
thought
,
were
most
deserving
of
such
indulgence
;
so
that
the
skipper
had
the
mortification
of
seeing
his
plan
miscarry
by
his
own
precipitate
conduct
;
for
,
had
he
held
his
tongue
,
no
body
would
have
dreamt
of
asking
for
the
provision
,
and
he
would
have
possessed
his
prize
in
peace
.
    
<EOS>
It
being
low
water
when
they
arrived
on
the
French
coast
,
the
vessel
could
not
enter
the
harbour
,
and
they
were
obliged
to
bring
to
,
and
wait
for
a
boat
,
which
in
less
than
half
an
hour
came
along
-
side
from
the
shore
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
now
came
upon
deck
,
and
snuffing
up
the
French
air
with
symptoms
of
infinite
satisfaction
,
asked
of
the
boatmen
,
with
the
friendly
appellation
of
Mes
enfans
,
what
they
must
have
for
transporting
them
and
their
baggage
to
the
pier
.
<EOS>
But
how
was
he
disconcerted
,
when
those
polite
,
candid
,
reasonable
watermen
,
demanded
a
Louis
d'or
for
that
service
!
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
with
a
sarcastic
sneer
,
observed
,
that
he
already
began
to
perceive
the
justice
of
his
encomiums
on
the
French
;
and
the
disappointed
governor
could
say
nothing
in
his
own
vindication
,
but
that
they
were
debauched
by
their
intercourse
with
the
inhabitants
of
Dover
.
    
<EOS>
His
pupil
,
however
,
was
so
much
offended
at
their
extortion
,
that
he
absolutely
refused
to
employ
them
,
even
when
they
abated
one
half
in
their
demand
,
and
swore
he
would
stay
on
board
till
the
packet
should
be
able
to
enter
the
harbour
,
rather
than
encourage
such
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
The
master
,
who
in
all
probability
had
some
sort
of
fellow
-
feeling
with
the
boatmen
,
in
vain
represented
,
that
he
could
not
with
safety
lie
to
,
or
anchor
upon
a
lee
-
shore
;
our
hero
having
consulted
Pipes
,
answered
,
that
he
had
hired
his
vessel
to
transport
him
to
Calais
,
and
that
he
would
oblige
him
to
perform
what
he
had
undertaken
.
    
<EOS>
The
skipper
,
very
much
mortified
at
this
peremptory
reply
,
which
was
not
over
and
above
agreeable
to
Mr
Jolter
,
dismissed
the
boat
,
notwithstanding
the
sollicitations
and
condescension
of
the
watermen
,
who
promised
to
submit
to
the
generosity
of
their
employer
;
and
running
a
little
farther
in
-
shore
,
came
to
an
anchor
,
and
waited
till
there
was
water
enough
to
float
them
over
the
bar
.
<EOS>
Then
they
stood
in
to
the
harbour
,
and
our
gentleman
,
with
his
attendants
and
baggage
,
were
landed
on
the
pier
by
the
sailors
,
whom
he
liberally
rewarded
for
their
trouble
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
plied
by
a
great
number
of
porters
,
who
,
like
so
many
hungry
wolves
,
laid
hold
on
his
luggage
,
and
began
to
carry
it
off
piece
-
meal
,
without
his
order
or
direction
.
<EOS>
Incensed
at
this
officious
insolence
,
he
commanded
them
to
desist
,
with
many
oaths
and
opprobrious
terms
that
his
anger
suggested
;
and
perceiving
that
one
of
them
did
not
seem
to
pay
any
regard
to
what
he
said
,
but
marched
off
with
his
burthen
,
he
snatched
a
cudgel
out
of
his
lacquey
's
hand
,
and
overtaking
the
fellow
in
a
twinkling
,
brought
him
to
the
ground
with
one
blow
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
instantly
surrounded
by
the
whole
congregration
of
this
canaille
,
who
resented
the
injury
which
their
brother
had
sustained
,
and
would
have
taken
immediate
satisfaction
of
the
aggressor
,
had
not
Pipes
,
seeing
his
master
involved
,
brought
the
whole
crew
to
his
assistance
,
and
exerted
himself
so
manfully
,
that
the
enemy
were
obliged
to
retreat
with
many
marks
of
defeat
,
and
menaces
of
interesting
the
commandant
in
their
quarrel
.
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
knew
and
dreaded
the
power
of
the
French
governor
,
began
to
shake
with
apprehension
,
when
he
heard
their
repeated
threats
;
but
they
durst
not
apply
to
this
magistrate
,
who
,
upon
a
fair
representation
of
the
case
,
would
have
punished
them
severely
for
their
rapacious
and
insolent
behaviour
;
and
Peregrine
,
without
farther
molestation
,
availed
himself
of
his
own
attendants
,
who
shouldered
his
baggage
,
and
followed
him
to
the
gate
,
where
they
were
stopt
by
the
centinels
,
until
their
names
should
be
registered
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
who
had
undergone
this
examination
before
,
resolved
to
profit
by
his
experience
,
and
cunningly
represented
his
pupil
as
a
young
English
lord
.
<EOS>
This
intimation
,
supported
by
the
appearance
of
his
equipage
,
was
no
sooner
communicated
to
the
officer
,
than
he
turned
out
the
guard
,
and
ordered
his
soldiers
to
rest
upon
their
arms
,
while
his
lordship
passed
in
great
state
to
the
Lion
d
'
Argent
,
where
he
took
up
his
lodging
for
the
night
,
resolving
to
set
out
for
Paris
next
morning
in
a
post
-
chaise
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
triumphed
greatly
in
this
piece
of
complaisance
and
respect
with
which
they
had
been
honoured
,
and
resumed
his
beloved
topic
of
discourse
,
in
applauding
the
method
and
subordination
of
the
French
government
,
which
was
better
calculated
for
maintaining
order
,
and
protecting
the
people
,
than
any
constitution
upon
earth
;
and
of
their
courteous
attention
to
strangers
,
there
needed
no
other
proof
than
the
compliment
which
had
been
paid
to
them
,
together
with
the
governor
's
connivance
at
Peregrine
's
employing
his
own
servants
in
carrying
the
baggage
to
the
inn
,
contrary
to
the
privilege
of
the
inhabitants
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
expatiated
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
self
-
indulgence
on
this
subject
,
the
valet
de
chambre
coming
into
the
room
,
interrupted
his
harangue
,
by
telling
his
master
,
that
their
trunks
and
portmanteaus
must
be
carried
to
the
custom
-
house
,
in
order
to
be
searched
,
and
sealed
with
lead
,
which
must
remain
untouched
until
their
arrival
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
made
no
objection
to
this
practice
,
which
was
in
itself
reasonable
enough
;
but
when
he
understood
that
the
gate
was
besieged
by
another
multitude
of
porters
,
who
insisted
upon
their
right
of
carrying
the
goods
,
and
also
of
fixing
their
own
price
,
he
absolutely
refused
to
comply
with
their
demand
;
and
chastising
some
of
the
most
clamorous
among
them
with
his
foot
,
told
them
,
that
if
their
custom
-
house
officers
had
a
mind
to
examine
his
baggage
,
they
might
come
to
the
inn
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
valet
de
chambre
was
abashed
at
this
boldness
of
his
master
's
behaviour
,
which
the
lacquey
,
shrugging
up
his
shoulders
,
observed
was
bien
a
l'Angloise
;
while
the
governor
represented
it
as
an
indignity
to
the
whole
nation
,
and
endeavoured
to
persuade
his
pupil
to
comply
with
the
custom
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
But
Peregrine
's
natural
haughtiness
of
disposition
hindered
him
from
giving
ear
to
Jolter
's
wholesome
advice
;
and
in
less
than
half
an
hour
they
perceived
a
file
of
musqueteers
marching
up
to
the
gate
.
<EOS>
At
sight
of
this
detachment
the
tutor
trembled
,
the
valet
grew
pale
,
and
the
lacquey
crossed
himself
;
but
our
hero
,
without
exhibiting
any
other
symptoms
than
those
of
indignation
,
met
them
on
the
threshold
,
and
with
a
ferocious
air
demanded
their
business
.
<EOS>
The
corporal
who
commanded
the
file
answered
with
great
deliberation
,
that
he
had
orders
to
convey
his
baggage
to
the
custom
-
house
;
and
seeing
the
trunks
standing
in
the
entry
,
placed
his
men
between
them
and
the
owner
,
while
the
porters
that
followed
,
took
them
up
,
and
proceeded
to
the
Douane
without
opposition
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
was
not
mad
enough
to
dispute
the
authority
of
this
message
;
but
,
in
order
to
gall
,
and
specify
his
contempt
for
those
who
brought
it
,
he
called
aloud
to
his
valet
,
desiring
him
,
in
French
,
to
accompany
his
things
,
and
see
that
none
of
his
linen
and
effects
should
be
stolen
by
the
searchers
.
<EOS>
The
corporal
,
mortified
at
this
satirical
insinuation
,
darted
a
look
of
resentment
at
the
author
,
as
if
he
had
been
interested
for
the
glory
of
his
nation
;
and
told
him
,
that
he
could
perceive
he
was
a
stranger
in
France
,
or
else
he
would
have
saved
himself
the
trouble
of
such
a
needless
precaution
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
expression
had
no
sooner
escaped
our
young
gentleman
,
than
he
was
ashamed
of
his
own
petulance
;
for
nothing
was
farther
from
his
principles
than
the
least
encouragement
of
ungenerous
suspicion
.

Chapter
XL
<EOS>
He
makes
a
fruitless
attempt
in
gallantry
;
departs
for
Boulogne
,
where
he
spends
the
evening
with
certain
English
exiles
.
   
<EOS>
Having
thus
yielded
to
the
hand
of
power
,
he
inquired
if
there
was
any
other
English
company
in
the
house
;
and
understanding
that
a
gentleman
and
lady
lodged
in
the
next
apartment
,
and
had
bespoke
a
post
-
chaise
for
Paris
,
he
ordered
Pipes
to
ingratiate
himself
with
their
footman
,
and
,
if
possible
,
learn
their
names
and
condition
,
while
he
and
Mr
Jolter
,
attended
by
the
lacquey
,
took
a
turn
round
the
ramparts
,
and
viewed
the
particulars
of
the
fortification
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
was
so
very
successful
in
his
inquiry
,
that
when
his
master
returned
,
he
was
able
to
give
him
a
very
satisfactory
account
of
his
fellow
-
lodgers
,
in
consequence
of
having
treated
his
brother
with
a
bottle
of
wine
.
<EOS>
The
people
in
question
were
a
gentleman
and
his
lady
,
lately
arrived
from
England
,
in
their
way
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
husband
was
a
man
of
good
fortune
,
who
had
been
a
libertine
in
his
youth
,
and
a
professed
declaimer
against
matrimony
.
<EOS>
He
neither
wanted
sense
nor
experience
,
and
piqued
himself
in
particular
upon
his
art
in
avoiding
the
snares
of
the
female
sex
,
in
which
he
pretended
to
be
deeply
versed
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
all
his
caution
and
skill
,
he
had
lately
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
attractions
of
an
oyster
-
wench
,
who
had
found
means
to
decoy
him
into
the
bands
of
wedlock
;
and
,
in
order
to
evade
the
compliments
and
congratulations
of
his
friends
and
acquaintance
,
he
had
come
so
far
on
a
tour
to
Paris
,
where
he
intended
to
initiate
his
spouse
in
the
beau
-
monde
;
though
in
the
mean
time
he
chose
to
live
upon
the
reserve
,
because
her
natural
talents
had
as
yet
received
but
little
cultivation
;
and
he
had
not
the
most
implicit
confidence
in
her
virtue
and
discretion
,
which
,
it
seems
,
had
like
to
have
yielded
to
the
addresses
of
an
officer
at
Canterbury
,
who
had
made
shift
to
insinuate
himself
into
her
acquaintance
and
favour
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
curiosity
being
inflamed
by
this
information
,
he
lounged
about
the
yard
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
the
Dulcinea
who
had
captivated
the
old
batchelor
,
and
at
length
observing
her
at
a
window
,
took
the
liberty
of
bowing
to
her
with
great
respect
.
<EOS>
She
returned
the
compliment
with
a
curt'sie
,
and
appeared
so
decent
in
her
dress
and
manner
,
that
unless
he
had
been
previously
informed
of
her
former
life
and
conversation
,
he
never
would
have
dreamt
that
her
education
was
different
from
that
of
other
ladies
of
fashion
;
so
easy
it
is
to
acquire
that
external
deportment
on
which
people
of
condition
value
themselves
so
much
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
Mr
Pickle
pretended
to
distinguish
a
certain
vulgar
audacity
in
her
countenance
,
which
in
a
lady
of
birth
and
fortune
would
have
passed
for
an
agreeable
vivacity
that
enlivens
the
aspect
,
and
gives
a
poignancy
to
every
feature
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
she
possessed
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
and
a
clear
complexion
,
overspread
with
the
glow
of
health
,
which
never
fails
of
recommending
the
owner
,
he
could
not
help
gazing
at
her
with
desire
,
and
forming
the
design
of
making
a
conquest
of
her
heart
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
sent
his
compliments
to
her
husband
,
whose
name
was
Hornbeck
,
with
an
intimation
,
that
he
proposed
to
set
out
next
day
for
Paris
,
and
as
he
understood
that
he
was
resolved
upon
the
same
journey
,
he
should
be
extremely
glad
of
his
company
on
the
road
,
if
he
was
not
better
engaged
.
<EOS>
Hornbeck
,
who
in
all
probability
did
not
chuse
to
accommodate
his
wife
with
a
squire
of
our
hero
's
appearance
,
sent
a
civil
answer
to
his
message
,
professing
infinite
mortification
at
his
being
unable
to
embrace
the
favour
of
his
kind
offer
,
by
reason
of
the
indisposition
of
his
wife
,
who
,
he
was
afraid
,
would
not
be
in
a
condition
for
some
days
to
bear
the
fatigue
of
travelling
.
<EOS>
This
rebuff
,
which
Peregrine
ascribed
to
the
husband
's
jealousy
,
stifled
his
project
in
embrio
;
he
ordered
his
French
servant
to
take
a
place
for
himself
in
the
Diligence
,
where
all
his
luggage
was
stowed
,
except
a
small
trunk
with
some
linen
and
other
necessaries
that
was
fixed
upon
the
post
-
chaise
which
they
hired
of
the
landlord
;
and
early
next
morning
he
and
Mr
Jolter
departed
from
Calais
,
attended
by
his
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
They
proceeded
without
any
accident
as
far
as
Boulogne
,
where
they
breakfasted
and
visited
old
father
Graham
,
a
Scottish
gentleman
of
the
governor
's
acquaintance
,
who
had
lived
as
a
capuchin
in
that
place
for
the
space
of
threescore
years
,
and
during
that
period
conformed
to
all
the
austerities
of
the
order
,
with
the
most
rigorous
exactness
;
being
equally
remarkable
for
the
frankness
of
his
conversation
,
the
humanity
of
his
disposition
,
and
the
simplicity
of
his
manners
.
    
<EOS>
From
Boulogne
they
took
their
departure
about
noon
,
and
as
they
proposed
to
sleep
that
night
at
Abbe
Ville
,
commanded
the
postilion
to
drive
with
extraordinary
speed
;
and
perhaps
it
was
well
for
his
cattle
that
the
axle
-
tree
gave
way
,
and
the
chaise
of
course
overturned
before
they
had
travelled
one
third
part
of
the
stage
.
    
<EOS>
This
accident
compelled
them
to
return
to
the
place
from
whence
they
had
set
out
,
and
as
they
could
not
procure
another
convenience
,
they
found
themselves
under
the
necessity
of
staying
till
their
chaise
could
be
refitted
.
<EOS>
Understanding
that
this
operation
would
detain
them
a
whole
day
,
our
young
gentleman
had
recourse
to
his
patience
,
and
demanded
to
know
what
they
could
have
for
dinner
;
the
garon
,
or
waiter
thus
questioned
,
vanished
in
a
moment
,
and
immediately
they
were
surprized
with
the
appearance
of
a
strange
figure
,
which
from
the
extravagance
of
its
dress
and
gesticulation
,
Peregrine
mistook
for
a
madman
of
the
growth
of
France
.
<EOS>
This
phantome
(
which
by
the
bye
,
happened
to
be
no
other
than
the
cook
)
was
a
tall
,
long
-
legged
,
meagre
,
swarthy
fellow
,
that
stooped
very
much
;
his
cheekbones
were
remarkably
raised
,
his
nose
bent
into
the
shape
and
size
of
a
powder
-
horn
,
and
the
sockets
of
his
eyes
as
raw
round
the
edges
,
as
if
the
skin
had
been
pared
off
;
on
his
head
he
wore
an
handkerchief
which
had
once
been
white
,
and
now
served
to
cover
the
upper
part
of
a
black
periwig
,
to
which
was
attached
a
bag
,
at
least
a
foot
square
,
with
a
solitaire
and
rose
that
stuck
up
on
each
side
to
his
ear
;
so
that
he
looked
like
a
criminal
in
the
pillory
;
his
back
was
accommodated
with
a
linnen
waistcoat
,
his
hands
adorned
with
long
ruffles
of
the
same
piece
,
his
middle
was
girded
by
an
apron
tucked
up
,
that
it
might
not
conceal
his
white
silk
stockings
rolled
;
and
at
his
entrance
he
brandished
a
bloody
weapon
full
three
feet
in
length
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
when
he
first
saw
him
approach
in
this
menacing
attitude
,
put
himself
upon
his
guard
,
but
being
informed
of
his
quality
,
perused
his
list
,
and
having
bespoke
three
or
four
things
for
dinner
,
walked
out
with
Mr
Jolter
to
view
both
towns
,
which
they
had
not
leisure
to
consider
minutely
before
.
<EOS>
In
their
return
from
the
harbour
they
met
with
four
or
five
gentlemen
,
all
of
whom
seemed
to
look
with
an
air
of
dejection
,
and
perceiving
our
hero
and
his
governor
to
be
English
by
their
dress
,
bowed
with
great
respect
as
they
passed
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
was
naturally
compassionate
,
felt
an
emotion
of
sympathy
;
and
seeing
a
person
,
who
by
his
habit
he
judged
to
be
one
of
their
servants
,
accosted
him
in
English
,
and
asked
who
the
gentlemen
were
.
<EOS>
The
lacquey
gave
him
to
understand
that
they
were
his
own
countrymen
,
exiled
from
their
native
homes
,
in
consequence
of
their
adherence
to
an
unfortunate
and
ruined
cause
;
and
that
they
were
gone
to
the
sea
-
side
,
according
to
their
daily
practice
,
in
order
to
indulge
their
longing
eyes
,
with
a
prospect
of
the
white
cliffs
of
Albion
,
which
they
must
never
more
approach
.
    
<EOS>
Though
our
young
gentleman
differed
widely
from
them
in
point
of
political
principles
,
he
was
not
one
of
those
enthusiasts
who
look
upon
every
schism
from
the
established
articles
of
faith
,
as
damnable
,
and
exclude
the
sceptick
from
every
benefit
of
humanity
and
christian
forgiveness
:
he
could
easily
comprehend
how
a
man
of
the
most
unblemished
morals
might
,
by
the
prejudice
of
education
,
or
indispensible
attachments
,
be
ingaged
in
such
a
blame
-
worthy
and
pernicious
undertaking
;
and
thought
that
they
had
already
suffered
severely
for
their
imprudence
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
affected
with
the
account
of
their
diurnal
pilgrimage
to
the
sea
-
side
,
which
he
considered
as
a
pathetic
proof
of
their
affliction
,
and
invested
Mr
Jolter
with
the
agreeable
office
of
going
to
them
with
a
compliment
in
his
name
,
and
begging
the
honour
of
drinking
a
glass
with
them
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
They
accepted
the
proposal
with
great
satisfaction
and
respectful
acknowledgement
,
and
in
the
afternoon
waited
upon
the
kind
inviter
,
who
treated
them
with
coffee
,
and
would
have
detained
them
to
supper
;
but
they
intreated
the
favour
of
his
company
at
the
house
which
they
frequented
,
so
earnestly
,
that
he
yielded
to
their
solicitations
,
and
with
his
governor
was
conducted
by
them
to
the
place
,
where
they
had
provided
an
elegant
repast
,
and
regaled
them
with
some
of
the
best
claret
in
France
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
easy
for
them
to
perceive
that
their
principal
guest
was
no
favourer
of
their
state
maxims
,
and
therefore
they
industriously
avoided
every
subject
of
conversation
which
could
give
the
least
offence
;
not
but
that
they
lamented
their
own
situation
,
which
cut
them
off
from
all
their
dearest
connexions
,
and
doomed
them
to
perpetual
banishment
from
their
families
and
friends
:
but
they
did
not
even
by
the
most
distant
hint
,
impeach
the
justice
of
that
sentence
by
which
they
were
condemned
;
although
one
among
them
,
who
seemed
to
be
about
the
age
of
thirty
,
wept
bitterly
over
his
misfortune
,
which
had
involved
a
beloved
wife
and
three
children
in
misery
and
distress
;
and
in
the
impatience
of
his
grief
,
cursed
his
own
fate
with
frantic
imprecations
.
    
<EOS>
His
companions
,
with
a
view
of
beguiling
his
sorrow
,
and
manifesting
their
own
hospitality
at
the
same
time
,
changed
the
topic
of
discourse
,
and
circulated
the
bumpers
with
great
assiduity
;
so
that
all
their
cares
were
overwhelmed
and
forgotten
,
several
drinking
French
catches
were
sung
,
and
mirth
and
good
fellowship
prevailed
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
elevation
,
which
commonly
unlocks
the
most
hidden
sentiment
,
and
dispels
every
consideration
of
caution
and
constraint
,
one
of
the
entertainers
being
more
intoxicated
than
his
fellows
,
proposed
a
toast
,
to
which
Peregrine
with
some
warmth
excepted
,
as
an
unmannerly
insult
.
<EOS>
The
other
maintained
his
proposition
with
indecent
heat
,
and
the
dispute
beginning
to
grow
very
serious
,
the
company
interposed
,
and
gave
judgment
against
their
friend
,
who
was
so
keenly
reproached
and
rebuked
for
his
impolite
behaviour
,
by
the
gentleman
whose
sensibility
hath
been
mentioned
,
that
he
retired
in
high
dudgeon
,
threatening
to
relinquish
their
society
,
and
branding
them
with
the
appellation
of
apostates
from
the
common
cause
.
<EOS>
Mortified
at
the
behaviour
of
their
companion
,
those
that
remained
were
earnest
in
their
apologies
to
their
guests
,
whom
they
besought
to
forgive
his
intemperance
;
assuring
them
with
great
confidence
,
that
he
would
upon
the
recovery
of
his
reflection
,
wait
upon
them
in
person
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
umbrage
he
had
given
.
<EOS>
Pickle
was
satisfied
with
their
remonstrances
,
resumed
his
good
humour
,
and
the
night
being
pretty
far
advanced
,
resisted
all
their
importunities
with
which
he
was
intreated
to
see
another
bottle
go
round
,
and
was
escorted
to
his
own
lodgings
,
more
than
half
seas
over
.
<EOS>
Next
morning
about
eight
o'clock
,
he
was
waked
by
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
told
him
that
two
of
the
gentlemen
with
whom
he
had
spent
the
evening
were
in
the
house
,
and
desired
the
favour
of
being
admitted
into
his
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
He
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
visit
,
and
ordering
his
man
to
shew
them
into
his
apartment
,
beheld
the
person
who
had
affronted
him
enter
with
the
gentleman
who
had
reprehended
his
rudeness
.
    
<EOS>
He
who
had
given
the
offence
,
after
having
made
an
apology
for
disturbing
Mr
Pickle
,
told
him
that
his
friend
there
present
had
been
with
him
early
that
morning
,
and
proposed
the
alternative
of
either
fighting
with
him
immediately
,
or
coming
to
beg
pardon
for
his
unmannerly
deportment
over
night
;
that
though
he
had
courage
enough
to
face
any
man
in
the
field
in
a
righteous
cause
,
he
was
not
so
brutal
as
to
disobey
the
dictates
of
his
own
duty
and
reflection
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
and
not
out
of
any
regard
to
the
other
's
menaces
,
which
he
despised
,
he
had
now
taken
the
liberty
of
interrupting
his
repose
,
that
he
might
as
soon
us
possible
,
atone
for
the
injury
he
had
done
him
,
which
he
protested
was
the
effect
of
intoxication
alone
,
and
begged
his
forgiveness
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
accepted
of
this
acknowledgment
very
graciously
,
thanked
the
other
gentleman
for
the
gallant
part
<EOS>
he
had
acted
in
his
behalf
;
and
perceiving
that
his
companion
was
a
little
irritated
at
his
officious
interposition
,
effected
a
reconciliation
,
by
convincing
him
that
what
he
had
done
was
for
the
honour
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
He
then
kept
them
to
breakfast
,
expressed
a
desire
of
seeing
their
situation
altered
for
the
better
,
and
the
chaise
being
repaired
,
took
his
leave
of
his
entertainers
,
who
came
to
wish
him
a
good
journey
,
and
with
his
attendants
left
.
<EOS>
Boulogne
for
the
second
time

Chapter
XLI
   
<EOS>
During
this
day
's
expedition
,
Mr
Jolter
took
an
opportunity
of
imparting
to
his
pupil
the
remarks
he
had
made
upon
the
industry
of
the
French
,
as
an
undeniable
proof
of
which
he
bad
him
cast
his
eyes
around
,
and
observe
with
what
care
every
spot
of
ground
was
cultivated
;
and
from
the
fertility
of
that
province
,
which
is
reckoned
the
poorest
in
France
,
conceive
the
wealth
and
affluence
of
the
nation
in
general
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
amazed
as
well
as
disgusted
at
this
infatuation
,
answered
that
what
he
ascribed
to
industry
,
was
the
effect
of
meer
wretchedness
;
the
miserable
peasants
being
obliged
to
plough
up
every
inch
of
ground
to
satisfy
their
oppressive
landlords
,
while
they
themselves
and
their
cattle
looked
like
so
many
images
of
famine
;
that
their
extreme
poverty
was
evident
from
the
face
of
the
country
,
on
which
there
was
not
one
inclosure
to
be
seen
,
or
any
other
object
,
except
scanty
crops
of
barley
and
oats
,
which
could
never
reward
the
toil
of
the
husbandman
;
that
their
habitations
were
no
better
than
paultry
huts
;
that
in
twenty
miles
of
extent
,
not
one
gentleman
's
house
appeared
;
that
nothing
was
more
abject
and
forlorn
than
the
attire
of
their
country
people
;
and
lastly
,
that
the
equipage
of
their
travelling
chaises
was
infinitely
inferior
to
that
of
a
dungcart
in
England
;
and
that
the
postilion
who
then
drove
their
carriage
,
had
neither
stockings
to
his
legs
,
nor
a
shirt
to
his
back
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
finding
his
charge
so
intractable
,
resolved
to
leave
him
in
the
mist
of
his
own
ignorance
and
prejudice
,
and
reserve
his
observations
for
those
who
would
pay
more
deference
to
his
opinion
;
and
indeed
this
resolution
he
had
often
made
,
and
as
often
broke
,
in
the
transports
of
his
zeal
,
that
frequently
hurried
him
out
of
the
plan
of
conduct
which
in
his
cooler
moments
he
had
laid
down
.
<EOS>
They
halted
for
a
refreshment
at
Montreuil
,
and
about
eight
in
the
evening
arrived
at
a
village
called
Bernay
,
where
while
they
waited
for
fresh
horses
,
they
were
informed
by
the
landlord
,
that
the
gates
of
Abbe
Ville
were
shut
every
night
punctually
at
nine
o'clock
;
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
get
admittance
;
and
that
there
was
not
another
place
of
entertainment
on
the
road
where
they
could
pass
the
night
;
he
therefore
,
as
a
friend
,
advised
them
to
stay
at
his
house
,
where
they
would
find
the
best
of
accommodation
,
and
proceed
upon
their
journey
by
times
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
though
he
had
travelled
on
that
road
before
,
could
not
recollect
whether
or
not
mine
host
spoke
truth
;
but
his
remonstrance
being
very
plausible
,
our
hero
determined
to
follow
his
advice
,
and
being
conducted
into
an
apartment
,
asked
what
they
could
have
for
supper
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
mentioned
every
thing
that
was
eatable
in
the
house
,
and
the
whole
being
ingrossed
for
the
use
of
him
and
his
attendants
,
he
amused
himself
till
such
time
as
it
could
be
dressed
,
in
conversing
with
the
daughter
,
who
was
a
sprightly
damsel
about
the
age
of
seventeen
;
and
in
strolling
about
the
house
,
which
stands
in
a
very
rural
situation
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
loitered
away
the
time
that
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
,
another
chaise
arrived
at
the
inn
,
and
upon
inquiry
he
found
that
the
new
comers
were
Mr
Hornbeck
and
his
lady
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
,
conscious
of
his
inability
to
entertain
this
second
company
,
came
and
begged
with
great
humiliation
that
Mr
Pickle
would
spare
them
some
part
of
the
victuals
he
had
bespoke
;
but
he
refused
to
part
with
so
much
as
the
wing
of
a
partridge
,
though
at
the
same
time
he
sent
his
compliments
to
the
strangers
,
and
giving
them
to
understand
how
ill
the
house
was
provided
for
their
reception
,
invited
them
to
partake
of
his
supper
.
<EOS>
Mr
Hornbeck
,
who
was
not
deficient
in
point
of
politeness
,
and
extremely
well
disposed
for
a
relishing
meal
,
which
he
had
reason
to
expect
from
the
savoury
steam
that
issued
from
the
kitchen
,
could
not
resist
this
second
instance
of
our
young
gentleman
's
civility
,
which
he
acknowledged
by
a
message
,
importing
that
he
and
his
wife
would
do
themselves
the
pleasure
of
profiting
by
his
courteous
offer
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
cheeks
glowed
when
he
found
himself
on
the
eve
of
being
acquainted
with
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
of
whose
heart
he
had
already
made
a
conquest
in
imagination
;
and
he
forthwith
set
his
invention
at
work
,
to
contrive
some
means
of
defeating
her
husband
's
vigilance
.
    
<EOS>
When
supper
was
ready
,
he
in
person
gave
notice
to
his
guests
,
and
leading
the
lady
into
his
apartments
,
seated
her
in
an
elbow
chair
at
the
upper
end
of
the
table
,
squeezing
her
hand
and
darting
a
most
insidious
glance
at
the
same
time
.
    
<EOS>
This
abrupt
behaviour
he
practised
on
the
presumption
,
that
a
lady
of
her
breeding
was
not
to
be
addressed
with
the
tedious
forms
that
must
be
observed
in
one
's
advances
to
a
person
of
birth
and
genteel
education
;
and
in
all
probability
his
calculation
was
just
,
for
Mrs
Hornbeck
gave
no
signs
of
discontent
at
this
sort
of
treatment
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
seemed
to
consider
it
as
a
proof
of
the
young
gentleman
's
regard
;
and
though
she
did
not
venture
to
open
her
mouth
three
times
during
the
whole
repast
,
she
shewed
herself
particularly
well
satisfied
with
her
entertainer
,
by
sundry
sly
and
significant
looks
,
while
her
husband
's
eyes
were
directed
another
way
,
and
divers
loud
peals
of
laughter
,
signifying
her
approbation
of
the
sallies
which
he
uttered
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
.
<EOS>
Her
spouse
began
to
be
very
uneasy
at
the
frank
demeanour
of
his
yokefellow
,
whom
he
endeavoured
to
check
in
her
vivacity
,
by
assuming
a
severity
of
aspect
;
but
whether
she
obeyed
the
dictates
of
her
own
disposition
,
which
,
perhaps
,
was
merry
and
unreserved
,
or
wanted
to
punish
Mr
Hornbeck
for
his
jealousy
of
temper
;
certain
it
is
,
her
gaiety
increased
to
such
a
degree
,
that
her
husband
was
grievously
alarmed
and
incensed
at
her
conduct
,
and
resolved
to
make
her
sensible
of
his
displeasure
,
by
treading
in
secret
upon
her
toes
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
so
disconcerted
by
his
indignation
,
that
he
mistook
his
mark
,
and
applied
the
sharp
heel
of
his
shoe
to
the
side
of
Mr
Jolter
's
foot
,
comprehending
his
little
toe
that
was
studded
with
an
angry
corn
,
which
he
invaded
with
such
a
sudden
jerk
,
that
the
governor
,
unable
to
endure
the
torture
in
silence
,
started
up
,
and
dancing
on
the
floor
,
roared
hideously
with
repeated
bellowings
,
to
the
unspeakable
enjoyment
of
Peregrine
and
the
lady
,
who
laughed
themselves
almost
into
convulsions
at
the
joke
.
    
<EOS>
Hornbeck
,
confounded
at
the
mistake
he
had
committed
,
begged
pardon
of
the
injured
tutor
with
great
contrition
,
protesting
that
the
blow
he
had
so
unfortunately
received
,
was
intended
for
an
ugly
cur
,
which
he
thought
had
posted
himself
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
It
was
lucky
for
him
that
there
was
actually
a
dog
in
the
room
,
to
justify
this
excuse
,
which
Jolter
admitted
with
the
tears
running
over
his
cheeks
,
and
the
oeconomy
of
the
table
was
re
-
composed
.
    
<EOS>
As
soon
,
however
,
as
the
strangers
could
with
decency
withdraw
,
this
suspicious
husband
took
his
leave
of
the
youth
,
on
pretence
of
being
fatigued
with
his
journey
,
after
having
,
by
way
of
compliment
,
proposed
that
they
should
travel
together
next
day
;
and
Peregrine
handed
the
lady
to
her
chamber
,
where
he
wished
her
good
night
with
another
warm
squeeze
,
which
she
returned
.
<EOS>
This
favourable
hint
made
his
heart
bound
with
a
transport
of
joy
;
he
lay
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
of
declaring
himself
,
and
seeing
the
husband
go
down
into
the
yard
with
a
candle
,
he
glided
softly
into
his
apartment
,
and
found
her
almost
undressed
.
<EOS>
Impelled
by
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
which
was
still
more
inflamed
by
her
present
luscious
appearance
,
and
encouraged
by
the
approbation
she
had
already
expressed
,
he
ran
towards
her
with
eagerness
,
crying
,
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
madam
,
your
charms
are
irresistible
!
"
<EOS>
and
without
further
ceremony
would
have
clasped
her
in
his
arms
,
had
not
she
begged
him
for
the
love
of
God
to
retire
,
for
should
<EOS>
Mr
Hornbeck
return
and
find
him
there
<EOS>
,
she
would
be
undone
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
not
so
blinded
by
his
passion
but
that
he
saw
the
reasonableness
of
her
fear
,
and
as
he
could
not
pretend
to
crown
his
wishes
at
that
interview
,
he
avowed
himself
her
lover
,
assured
her
that
he
would
exhaust
his
whole
invention
in
finding
a
proper
opportunity
for
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
;
and
in
the
mean
time
he
ravished
sundry
small
favours
,
which
she
in
the
hurry
of
her
fright
could
not
with
-
hold
from
his
impudence
of
address
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
happily
settled
the
preliminaries
,
he
withdrew
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
spent
the
whole
night
in
contriving
stratagems
to
elude
the
jealous
caution
of
his
fellow
-
traveller
.

Chapter
XLII
<EOS>
They
set
out
in
company
,
breakfast
at
Abbe
Ville
,
dine
at
Amiens
,
and
about
eleven
o'clock
arrive
at
Chantilly
,
where
Peregrine
executes
a
plan
which
he
had
concerted
upon
Hornbeck
.
   
<EOS>
The
whole
company
by
agreement
rose
and
departed
before
day
,
and
breakfasted
at
Abbe
Ville
,
where
they
became
acquainted
with
the
finesse
of
their
Bernay
landlord
,
who
had
imposed
upon
them
,
in
affirming
that
they
would
not
have
been
admitted
after
the
gates
were
shut
.
<EOS>
From
thence
they
proceeded
to
Amiens
,
where
they
dined
and
were
pestered
by
begging
friars
;
and
the
roads
being
deep
<EOS>
,
it
was
eleven
o'clock
at
night
before
they
reached
Chantilly
,
where
they
found
supper
already
dressed
,
in
consequence
of
having
dispatched
the
valet
de
chambre
before
them
on
horseback
.
    
<EOS>
The
constitution
of
Horneck
being
very
much
impaired
by
a
life
of
irregularity
<EOS>
,
he
found
himself
so
fatigued
with
this
day
's
journey
,
which
amounted
to
upwards
of
an
hundred
miles
,
that
when
he
sat
down
at
table
,
he
could
scarce
sit
upright
;
and
in
less
than
three
minutes
began
to
nod
in
his
chair
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
had
foreseen
and
provided
for
this
occasion
,
advised
him
to
exhilarate
his
spirits
with
a
glass
of
wine
;
and
the
proposal
being
embraced
,
tipt
his
valet
de
chambre
the
wink
,
who
,
according
to
the
instructions
he
had
received
,
qualified
the
Burgundy
with
thirty
drops
of
laudanum
,
which
this
unfortunate
husband
swallowed
in
one
glass
.
<EOS>
The
dose
cooperating
with
his
former
drowsiness
,
lulled
him
so
fast
asleep
,
as
it
were
instantaneously
,
that
it
was
found
necessary
to
convey
him
to
his
own
chamber
,
where
his
footman
undressed
and
put
him
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Jolter
(
naturally
of
a
sluggish
disposition
)
able
to
resist
his
propensity
to
sleep
,
without
suffering
divers
dreadful
yawns
,
which
encouraged
his
pupil
to
administer
the
same
dose
to
him
,
which
had
operated
so
successfully
upon
the
other
Argus
.
<EOS>
This
cordial
had
not
such
a
gentle
effect
upon
the
rugged
organs
of
Jolter
as
upon
the
more
delicate
nerves
of
Hornbeck
;
but
discovered
itself
in
certain
involuntary
startings
,
and
convulsive
motions
in
the
muscles
of
his
face
;
and
when
his
nature
at
length
yielded
to
the
power
of
this
medicine
,
he
sounded
the
trumpet
so
loud
through
his
nostrils
,
that
our
adventurer
was
afraid
the
noise
would
awake
his
other
patient
,
and
consequently
prevent
the
accomplishment
of
his
aim
.
<EOS>
The
governor
was
therefore
committed
to
the
care
of
Pipes
,
who
lugged
him
into
the
next
room
,
and
having
stripped
off
his
cloaths
,
tumbled
him
into
his
nest
,
while
the
two
lovers
remained
at
full
liberty
to
indulge
their
mutual
passion
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
the
impatience
of
his
inclination
,
would
have
finished
the
fate
of
Hornbeck
immediately
;
but
his
inamorata
disapproved
of
his
intention
,
and
represented
that
their
being
together
by
themselves
for
any
length
of
time
,
would
be
observed
by
her
servant
,
who
was
kept
as
a
spy
upon
her
actions
;
so
that
they
had
recourse
to
another
scheme
,
which
was
executed
in
this
manner
:
He
conducted
her
into
her
own
apartment
,
in
presence
of
her
footman
,
who
lighted
them
thither
,
and
wishing
her
good
rest
,
returned
to
his
own
chamber
,
where
he
waited
till
every
thing
was
quiet
in
the
house
;
and
then
stealing
softly
to
her
door
,
which
had
been
left
open
for
his
admission
in
the
dark
<EOS>
,
he
found
the
husband
still
secure
in
the
embraces
of
sleep
,
and
the
lady
in
a
loose
gown
,
ready
to
seal
his
happiness
.
<EOS>
He
seized
opportunity
by
the
forelock
,
and
bearing
her
in
his
arms
to
the
place
from
whence
he
came
,
she
was
revenged
upon
the
cuckold
for
the
uneasy
life
he
had
made
her
lead
,
and
our
hero
enjoyed
the
luscious
fruits
of
his
conquest
.
    
<EOS>
Their
guilty
raptures
,
however
,
were
not
without
allay
.
<EOS>
The
opium
which
had
been
given
to
Jolter
,
together
with
the
wine
he
had
drank
,
produced
such
a
perturbation
in
his
fancy
,
that
he
was
visited
with
horrible
dreams
,
and
among
other
miserable
situations
,
imagined
himself
in
danger
of
perishing
in
the
flames
,
which
he
thought
had
taken
hold
on
his
apartment
.
<EOS>
This
vision
made
such
an
impression
upon
his
faculties
,
that
he
alarmed
the
whole
house
with
the
repeated
cries
of
Fire
!
<EOS>
Fire
!
<EOS>
and
even
leaped
out
of
his
bed
,
though
he
still
remained
fast
asleep
.
<EOS>
The
lovers
were
very
disagreeably
disturbed
by
this
dreadful
exclamation
,
and
Mrs
Hornbeck
running
in
great
confusion
to
the
door
,
had
the
mortification
to
see
the
footman
with
a
light
in
his
hand
,
enter
her
husband
's
chamber
,
in
order
to
give
them
notice
of
this
accident
.
    
<EOS>
She
knew
that
she
would
be
instantly
missed
,
and
could
easily
divine
the
consequence
,
unless
her
invention
could
immediately
trump
up
some
plausible
excuse
for
her
absence
.
    
<EOS>
Women
are
naturally
fruitful
of
expedients
in
cases
of
such
emergency
;
she
employed
but
a
few
seconds
in
recollection
,
and
rushing
directly
towards
the
apartment
of
the
governor
,
who
still
continued
to
hollow
in
the
same
note
,
exclaimed
in
a
screaming
tone
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
where
!
where
!
"
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
all
the
servants
were
assembled
in
strange
attire
;
Peregrine
slipt
on
his
breeches
,
burst
into
Jolter
's
room
,
and
seeing
him
stalking
in
his
shirt
with
his
eyes
shut
,
bestowed
such
a
slap
upon
his
buttocks
,
as
in
a
moment
dissolved
his
dream
,
and
restored
him
to
the
use
of
his
senses
.
<EOS>
He
was
astonished
and
ashamed
at
being
discovered
in
such
an
indecent
attitude
;
and
taking
refuge
under
the
cloaths
,
asked
pardon
of
all
present
for
the
disturbance
he
had
occasioned
;
solliciting
with
great
humility
the
forgiveness
of
the
lady
,
who
,
to
a
miracle
,
counterfeited
the
utmost
agitation
of
terror
and
surprize
.
<EOS>
Mean
while
,
Hornbeck
being
awakened
by
the
repeated
efforts
of
his
man
,
no
sooner
understood
that
his
wife
was
missing
,
than
all
the
chimera
's
of
jealousy
taking
possession
of
his
imagination
,
he
started
up
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
,
and
snatching
his
sword
,
flew
straight
to
Peregrine
's
chamber
,
where
,
though
he
found
not
that
which
he
looked
for
,
he
unluckily
perceived
upon
the
bed
an
under
-
petticoat
,
which
his
wife
had
forgot
in
the
hurry
of
her
retreat
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
added
fuel
to
the
flame
of
his
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
He
seized
the
fatal
proof
of
his
dishonour
,
and
meeting
his
spouse
in
her
return
to
bed
,
presented
it
to
her
view
,
saying
,
with
a
most
expressive
countenance
,
"
Madam
,
you
have
dropped
your
under
-
petticoat
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
who
inherited
from
nature
a
most
admirable
presence
of
mind
,
looked
earnestly
at
the
object
in
question
,
and
with
incredible
serenity
of
countenance
,
affirmed
that
the
petticoat
must
belong
to
the
house
,
for
she
had
none
such
in
her
possession
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
walked
behind
her
,
hearing
this
asseveration
,
immediately
interposed
,
and
pulling
Hornbeck
by
the
sleeve
into
his
chamber
,
"
Gadszooks
!
<EOS>
said
he
,
what
business
had
you
with
that
petticoat
?
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
let
a
young
fellow
enjoy
a
little
amour
with
an
innkeeper
's
daughter
,
without
exposing
his
infirmities
to
your
wife
?
<EOS>
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
that
's
so
malicious
,
because
you
have
quitted
these
adventures
yourself
,
to
spoil
the
sport
of
other
people
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
poor
husband
was
so
confounded
at
the
effrontery
of
his
wife
,
and
this
cavalier
declaration
of
the
young
man
,
that
his
faith
began
to
waver
;
he
distrusted
his
own
conscious
diffidence
of
temper
,
which
that
he
might
not
expose
,
he
expressed
no
doubts
of
Peregrine
's
veracity
,
but
asking
pardon
for
the
mistake
he
had
committed
,
retired
with
a
grim
look
,
not
yet
satisfied
with
the
behaviour
of
his
ingenious
helpmate
,
but
on
the
contrary
determined
to
inquire
more
minutely
into
the
circumstances
of
this
adventure
;
which
turned
out
so
little
to
his
satisfaction
,
that
he
ordered
his
servant
to
get
every
thing
ready
for
his
departure
by
break
of
day
;
and
when
our
adventurer
rose
next
morning
,
he
found
that
his
fellow
-
travellers
were
gone
above
three
hours
,
though
they
had
agreed
to
stay
all
the
forenoon
,
with
a
view
of
seeing
the
prince
of
Conde
's
palace
,
and
to
proceed
all
together
for
Paris
in
the
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
a
little
chagrined
,
when
he
understood
that
he
was
so
suddenly
deprived
of
this
almost
untasted
morsel
;
and
Jolter
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
their
abrupt
and
uncivil
disappearance
,
which
after
many
profound
conjectures
,
he
accounted
for
,
by
supposing
that
Hornbeck
was
some
sharper
who
had
run
away
with
an
heiress
,
whom
he
found
it
necessary
to
conceal
from
the
inquiry
of
her
friends
.
    
<EOS>
The
pupil
,
who
was
well
assured
of
the
true
motive
,
allowed
his
governor
to
enjoy
the
triumph
of
his
own
penetration
,
and
consoled
himself
with
the
hope
of
seeing
his
Dulcinea
again
at
some
of
the
public
places
in
Paris
,
which
he
proposed
to
frequent
.
<EOS>
Thus
comforted
,
he
visited
the
magnificent
stables
and
palace
of
Chantilly
,
and
immediately
after
dinner
set
out
for
Paris
,
where
they
arrived
in
the
evening
,
and
hired
apartments
at
an
hotel
in
the
Fauxbourg
St
Germaine
,
not
far
from
the
playhouse
.

Chapter
XLIII
   
<EOS>
They
were
no
sooner
settled
in
these
lodgings
,
than
our
hero
wrote
to
his
uncle
an
account
of
their
safe
arrival
,
and
sent
another
letter
to
his
friend
Gauntlet
,
with
a
very
tender
billet
inclosed
for
his
dear
Emilia
,
to
whom
he
repeated
all
his
former
vows
of
constancy
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
care
that
ingrossed
him
was
that
of
bespeaking
several
suits
of
cloaths
suitable
to
the
French
mode
,
and
in
the
mean
time
he
never
appeared
abroad
,
except
in
the
English
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
soon
became
acquainted
with
some
of
his
own
countrymen
,
who
were
at
Paris
on
the
same
footing
with
himself
.
<EOS>
The
third
evening
after
his
journey
,
he
was
engaged
in
a
party
of
those
young
sparks
,
at
the
house
of
a
noted
Traiteur
,
whose
wife
was
remarkably
handsome
,
and
otherwise
extremely
well
qualified
for
alluring
customers
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
To
this
lady
our
young
gentleman
was
introduced
as
a
stranger
fresh
from
England
;
and
he
was
charmed
with
her
personal
accomplishments
,
as
well
as
with
the
freedom
and
gaiety
of
her
conversation
:
having
sat
with
them
about
an
hour
,
she
got
up
in
order
to
retire
,
but
being
earnestly
intreated
to
favour
them
with
her
company
at
supper
,
she
promised
to
gratify
their
desire
,
and
told
them
,
without
any
ceremony
or
circumlocution
,
that
she
would
only
step
into
the
next
room
to
make
water
,
and
return
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
This
frank
declaration
sounded
so
oddly
in
the
ears
of
Peregrine
,
that
he
concluded
he
might
,
without
offence
,
take
any
sort
of
liberty
with
a
woman
who
could
thus
behave
so
wide
of
decency
and
decorum
;
and
on
this
supposition
,
he
followed
her
cavalierly
to
her
closet
,
where
he
addressed
her
in
such
palpable
terms
,
as
he
thought
her
character
intitled
him
to
use
.
    
<EOS>
She
was
surprised
at
his
confidence
,
which
she
began
to
rally
as
a
specimen
of
English
plain
dealing
,
while
she
very
deliberately
executed
in
his
presence
the
intent
of
her
withdrawing
;
and
he
still
more
encouraged
by
this
deportment
,
urged
his
suit
with
such
impetuosity
,
that
the
fair
Burgeoise
was
compelled
to
cry
aloud
in
defence
of
her
own
virtue
.
<EOS>
Her
husband
ran
immediately
to
her
assistance
,
and
finding
her
in
a
very
alarming
situation
,
flew
upon
her
ravisher
with
such
fury
,
that
he
was
fain
to
quit
his
prey
,
and
turn
against
the
exasperated
Traiteur
,
whom
he
punished
without
mercy
for
his
impudent
intrusion
.
<EOS>
The
lady
seeing
her
yokefellow
treated
with
so
little
respect
,
espoused
his
cause
,
and
fixing
her
nails
in
his
antagonist
's
face
,
scarified
all
one
side
of
his
nose
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
this
encounter
brought
all
the
servants
of
the
house
to
the
rescue
of
their
master
,
and
Peregrine
's
company
arriving
at
the
same
time
,
a
general
battle
ensued
,
in
which
the
French
were
totally
routed
,
the
wife
being
insulted
,
and
the
husband
kicked
down
stairs
.
    
<EOS>
The
publican
enraged
at
the
indignity
which
had
been
offered
to
him
and
his
family
,
went
out
into
the
street
,
and
implored
the
protection
of
the
guet
or
city
-
guard
,
which
having
heard
his
complaint
,
fixed
their
bayonets
and
surrounded
the
door
,
to
the
number
of
twelve
or
fourteen
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentlemen
flushed
with
their
success
,
and
considering
the
soldiers
as
so
many
London
watchmen
,
whom
they
had
often
put
to
flight
,
drew
their
swords
,
and
sallied
out
,
with
Peregrine
at
their
head
.
<EOS>
Whether
the
guard
respected
them
as
foreigners
,
or
inexperienced
youths
intoxicated
with
liquor
,
they
opened
to
right
and
left
,
and
gave
them
room
to
pass
,
without
opposition
.
    
<EOS>
This
complaisance
,
which
was
the
effect
of
compassion
,
being
misinterpreted
by
the
English
leader
,
he
out
of
meer
wantonness
attempted
to
trip
up
the
heels
of
the
soldier
that
stood
next
him
,
but
failed
in
the
execution
,
and
received
a
blow
on
his
breast
with
the
butt
end
of
a
fusil
,
that
made
him
stagger
several
paces
backward
.
<EOS>
Incensed
at
this
audacious
application
,
the
whole
company
charged
the
detachment
sword
in
hand
,
and
after
an
obstinate
engagement
,
in
which
divers
wounds
were
given
and
received
,
every
soul
of
them
was
taken
,
and
conveyed
to
the
main
-
guard
,
where
the
commanding
officer
being
made
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
the
quarrel
,
in
consideration
of
their
youth
and
national
ferocity
,
for
which
the
French
make
large
allowances
,
set
them
all
at
liberty
,
after
having
gently
rebuked
them
for
the
irregularity
and
insolence
of
their
conduct
:
so
that
all
our
hero
acquired
by
his
gallantry
and
courage
,
was
a
number
of
scandalous
marks
upon
his
visage
,
that
confined
him
a
whole
week
to
his
chamber
.
<EOS>
It
was
impossible
to
conceal
this
disaster
from
Mr
Jolter
,
who
having
got
intelligence
of
the
particulars
,
did
not
fail
to
remonstrate
against
the
rashness
of
the
adventure
,
which
,
he
observed
,
must
have
been
fatal
to
them
,
had
their
enemies
been
other
than
Frenchmen
,
who
of
all
nations
under
the
sun
,
most
rigorously
observe
the
laws
of
hospitality
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
governor
's
acquaintance
lay
chiefly
among
Irish
and
English
priests
,
and
a
set
of
low
people
,
who
live
by
making
themselves
necessary
to
strangers
,
either
in
teaching
the
French
language
,
or
executing
small
commissions
with
which
they
are
intrusted
,
he
was
not
the
most
proper
person
in
the
world
for
regulating
the
taste
of
a
young
gentleman
who
travelled
for
improvement
,
in
expectation
of
making
a
figure
one
day
in
his
own
country
;
and
being
conscious
of
his
own
incapacity
,
he
contented
himself
with
the
office
of
a
steward
,
and
kept
a
faithful
account
of
all
the
money
that
was
disbursed
in
the
course
of
their
family
expence
:
not
but
that
he
was
acquainted
with
all
the
places
which
are
visited
by
strangers
on
their
first
arrival
at
Paris
;
and
knew
to
a
liard
what
was
commonly
given
to
the
Swiss
of
each
remarkable
hotel
;
though
,
with
respect
to
the
curious
painting
and
statuary
that
every
where
abound
in
that
metropolis
,
he
was
more
ignorant
than
the
domestic
that
attends
for
a
livre
a
day
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
Mr
Jolter
could
give
a
very
good
account
of
the
stages
on
the
road
,
and
save
the
expence
of
Antonini
's
detail
of
the
curiosities
in
Paris
;
he
was
a
connoisseur
in
ordinaries
,
from
twelve
to
five
and
thirty
livres
,
knew
all
the
rates
of
a
Fiacre
and
Remise
,
could
dispute
with
a
Tailleur
or
Traiteur
upon
the
articles
of
his
bill
,
and
scold
the
servants
in
tolerable
French
.
<EOS>
But
the
laws
,
customs
and
genius
of
the
people
,
the
characters
of
individuals
,
and
scenes
of
polished
life
,
were
subjects
which
he
had
neither
opportunities
to
observe
,
inclination
to
consider
,
or
discernment
to
distinguish
.
<EOS>
All
his
maxims
were
the
suggestions
of
pedantry
and
prejudice
;
so
that
his
perception
was
obscured
,
his
judgment
biassed
,
his
address
aukward
,
and
his
conversation
absurd
and
unentertaining
:
yet
such
as
I
have
represented
this
tutor
,
is
the
greatest
part
of
those
animals
who
lead
raw
boys
about
the
world
,
under
the
denomination
of
travelling
governors
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
therefore
,
being
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
extent
of
Mr
Jolter
's
abilities
,
never
dreamt
of
consulting
him
in
the
disposition
of
his
conduct
,
but
parcelled
out
his
time
according
to
the
dictates
of
his
own
reflection
,
and
the
information
and
direction
of
his
companions
,
who
had
lived
longer
in
France
,
and
consequently
were
better
acquainted
with
the
pleasures
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
As
soon
as
he
was
in
a
condition
to
appear
a
la
Franoise
,
he
hired
a
genteel
chariot
by
the
month
,
made
the
tour
of
the
Luxembourg
gallery
,
Palais
Royal
,
all
the
remarkable
hotels
,
churches
and
celebrated
places
in
Paris
;
visited
St
Cloud
,
Marli
,
Versailles
,
Trianon
,
St
Germain
,
and
Fountainbleau
;
enjoyed
the
opera
,
masquerades
,
Italian
and
French
comedy
;
and
seldom
failed
of
appearing
in
the
public
walks
,
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
or
some
adventure
suited
to
his
romantic
disposition
.
<EOS>
He
never
doubted
that
his
person
would
attract
the
notice
of
some
distinguished
inamorata
,
and
was
vain
enough
to
believe
that
few
female
hearts
were
able
to
resist
the
artillery
of
his
accomplishments
,
if
once
he
had
an
opportunity
of
planting
it
to
advantage
.
<EOS>
He
presented
himself
,
however
,
at
all
the
Spectacles
for
many
weeks
,
without
reaping
the
fruits
of
his
expectation
;
and
began
to
entertain
a
very
indifferent
idea
of
the
French
discernment
,
which
had
overlooked
him
so
long
,
when
one
day
in
his
way
to
the
opera
,
his
chariot
was
stopped
by
an
embarras
in
the
street
,
occasioned
by
two
peasants
,
who
having
driven
their
carts
against
each
other
,
quarrelled
,
and
went
to
loggerheads
on
the
spot
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
rencounter
is
so
uncommon
in
France
,
that
the
people
shut
up
their
shops
,
and
from
their
windows
threw
cold
water
upon
the
combatants
,
with
a
view
of
putting
an
end
to
the
battle
,
which
was
maintained
with
great
fury
and
very
little
skill
,
until
one
of
them
receiving
an
accidental
fall
,
the
other
took
the
advantage
of
this
misfortune
,
and
fastening
upon
him
as
he
lay
,
began
to
thump
the
pavement
with
his
head
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
equipage
being
detained
close
by
the
field
of
this
contention
,
Pipes
could
not
bear
to
see
the
laws
of
boxing
so
scandalously
transgressed
,
and
leaping
from
his
station
,
pulled
the
offender
from
his
antagonist
,
whom
he
raised
up
,
and
in
the
English
language
,
encouraged
to
a
second
essay
,
instructing
him
at
the
same
time
,
by
clenching
his
fists
according
to
art
,
and
putting
himself
in
a
proper
attitude
.
<EOS>
Thus
confirmed
,
the
enraged
carman
sprung
upon
his
foe
,
and
in
all
appearance
would
have
effectually
revenged
the
injury
he
had
sustained
,
if
he
had
not
been
prevented
by
the
interposition
of
a
lacquey
belonging
to
a
nobleman
,
whose
coach
was
obliged
to
halt
in
consequence
of
the
dispute
.
<EOS>
This
footman
,
who
was
distinguished
by
a
cane
,
descending
from
his
post
,
without
the
least
ceremony
or
expostulation
,
began
to
employ
his
weapon
upon
the
head
and
shoulders
of
the
peasant
who
had
been
patronized
by
Pipes
;
upon
which
Thomas
resenting
such
ungenerous
behaviour
,
bestowed
such
a
stomacher
upon
the
officious
intermeddler
,
as
discomposed
the
whole
oeconomy
of
his
entrails
,
and
obliged
him
to
discharge
the
interjection
ah
!
<EOS>
with
demonstrations
of
great
anguish
and
amazement
.
<EOS>
The
other
two
footmen
who
stood
behind
the
coach
,
seeing
their
fellow
-
servant
so
insolently
assaulted
,
flew
to
his
assistance
,
and
rained
a
most
disagreeable
shower
upon
the
head
of
his
aggressor
,
who
had
no
means
of
diversion
or
defence
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
did
not
approve
of
Tom
's
conduct
,
could
not
bear
to
see
him
so
roughly
handled
,
especially
as
he
thought
his
own
honour
concerned
in
the
fray
,
and
therefore
quitting
his
machine
,
came
to
the
rescue
of
his
attendant
,
and
charged
his
adversaries
sword
in
hand
.
<EOS>
Two
of
them
no
sooner
perceived
this
reinforcement
,
than
they
betook
themselves
to
flight
;
and
Pipes
having
twisted
the
cane
out
of
the
hands
of
the
third
,
belaboured
him
so
unmercifully
,
that
our
hero
thought
proper
to
interpose
his
authority
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
The
common
people
stood
aghast
at
this
unprecedented
boldness
of
Pickle
,
who
understanding
that
the
person
whose
servants
he
had
disciplined
,
was
a
general
and
prince
of
the
blood
,
went
up
to
the
coach
,
and
asked
pardon
for
what
he
had
done
,
imputing
his
own
behaviour
to
his
ignorance
of
the
other
's
quality
.
<EOS>
The
old
nobleman
accepted
of
his
apology
with
great
politeness
,
thanking
him
for
the
trouble
he
had
taken
to
reform
the
manners
of
his
domesticks
;
and
guessing
from
our
youth
's
appearance
that
he
was
some
stranger
of
condition
,
very
courteously
invited
him
into
the
coach
,
on
the
supposition
that
they
were
both
bound
for
the
opera
.
<EOS>
Pickle
gladly
embraced
this
opportunity
of
becoming
acquainted
with
a
person
of
such
rank
,
and
ordering
his
own
chariot
to
follow
,
accompanied
the
count
to
his
loge
,
where
he
conversed
with
him
during
the
whole
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
He
soon
perceived
that
Peregrine
was
not
deficient
in
spirit
or
sense
,
and
seemed
particularly
pleased
with
his
engaging
manner
and
easy
deportment
,
qualifications
for
which
the
English
nation
is
by
no
means
remarkable
in
France
,
and
therefore
the
more
conspicuous
and
agreeable
in
the
character
of
our
hero
,
whom
the
nobleman
carried
home
that
same
evening
,
and
introduced
to
his
lady
,
and
several
persons
of
fashion
who
supped
at
his
house
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
quite
captivated
by
their
affable
behaviour
and
the
vivacity
of
their
discourse
;
and
after
having
been
honoured
with
particular
marks
of
consideration
,
took
his
leave
,
fully
determined
to
cultivate
such
a
valuable
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
His
vanity
suggested
,
that
now
the
time
was
come
when
he
should
profit
by
his
talents
among
the
fair
sex
,
on
whom
he
resolved
to
employ
his
utmost
art
and
address
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
assiduously
engaged
in
all
parties
to
which
he
had
access
,
by
means
of
his
noble
friend
,
who
let
slip
no
opportunity
of
gratifying
his
ambition
.
<EOS>
He
for
some
time
shared
in
all
his
amusements
,
and
was
entertained
in
many
of
the
best
families
of
France
;
but
he
did
not
long
enjoy
that
elevation
of
hope
which
had
flattered
his
imagination
.
<EOS>
He
soon
perceived
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
maintain
the
honourable
connexions
he
had
made
,
without
engaging
every
day
at
quadrille
,
or
in
other
words
,
losing
his
money
;
for
every
person
of
rank
,
whether
male
or
female
,
was
a
professed
gamester
,
who
knew
and
practised
all
the
finesse
of
the
art
,
of
which
he
was
intirely
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
began
to
find
himself
a
meer
novice
in
French
gallantry
,
which
is
supported
by
an
amazing
volubility
of
tongue
,
an
obsequious
and
incredible
attention
to
trifles
,
a
surprising
faculty
of
laughing
out
of
pure
complaisance
,
and
a
nothingness
of
conversation
,
which
he
could
never
attain
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
our
hero
,
who
among
his
own
countrymen
would
have
passed
for
a
sprightly
entertaining
fellow
,
was
considered
in
the
brilliant
assemblies
of
France
as
a
youth
of
a
very
phlegmatic
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
that
his
pride
was
mortified
at
his
own
want
of
importance
,
which
he
did
not
fail
to
ascribe
to
their
defect
in
point
of
judgment
and
taste
<EOS>
:
he
conceived
a
disgust
at
the
mercenary
conduct
,
as
well
as
the
shallow
intellects
of
the
ladies
;
and
after
he
had
spent
some
months
,
and
a
round
sum
of
money
,
in
fruitless
attendance
and
addresses
,
he
fairly
quitted
the
pursuit
,
and
consoled
himself
with
the
conversation
of
a
merry
Fille
de
joye
,
whose
good
graces
he
acquired
by
an
allowance
of
twenty
Louis
per
month
;
and
that
he
might
the
more
easily
afford
this
expence
,
dismissed
his
chariot
and
French
lacquey
at
the
same
time
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
entered
himself
in
a
noted
academy
,
in
order
to
finish
his
exercises
,
and
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
a
few
sensible
people
,
whom
he
distinguished
at
the
coffee
-
house
and
ordinary
to
which
he
resorted
,
and
who
contributed
not
a
little
to
the
improvement
of
his
knowledge
and
taste
;
for
,
prejudice
apart
,
it
must
be
owned
that
France
abounds
with
men
of
consummate
honour
,
profound
sagacity
,
and
the
most
liberal
education
.
<EOS>
From
the
conversation
of
such
,
he
obtained
a
distinct
idea
of
their
government
and
constitution
;
and
though
he
could
not
help
admiring
the
excellent
order
and
oeconomy
of
their
police
,
the
result
of
all
his
inquiries
was
self
-
congratulation
on
his
title
to
the
privileges
of
a
British
subject
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
invaluable
birthright
was
rendered
conspicuous
by
such
flagrant
occurrences
,
which
fell
every
day
almost
under
his
observation
,
that
nothing
but
the
grossest
prejudice
could
dispute
its
existence
.

Acquires

whom
he
afterwards
fights
and

for

amorous
recreations
.
   
<EOS>
Among
many
other
instances
of
the
same
nature
,
I
believe
it
will
not
be
amiss
to
exhibit
a
few
specimens
of
their
administration
,
which
happened
during
his
abode
at
Paris
,
that
those
who
have
not
the
opportunity
of
observing
for
themselves
,
or
are
in
danger
of
being
influenced
by
misrepresentation
,
may
compare
their
own
condition
with
that
of
their
neighbours
,
and
do
justice
to
the
constitution
under
which
they
live
.
    
<EOS>
A
lady
of
distinguished
character
having
been
lampooned
by
some
obscure
scribler
,
who
could
not
be
discovered
,
the
ministry
,
in
consequence
of
her
complaint
,
ordered
no
fewer
than
five
and
twenty
abbes
to
be
apprehended
and
sent
to
the
Bastile
,
on
the
maxim
of
Herod
,
when
he
commanded
the
innocents
to
be
murdered
,
hoping
that
the
principal
object
of
his
cruelty
would
not
escape
in
the
general
calamity
;
and
the
friends
of
those
unhappy
prisoners
durst
not
even
complain
of
the
unjust
persecution
,
but
shrugged
up
their
shoulders
,
and
in
silence
deplored
their
misfortune
,
uncertain
whether
or
not
they
should
ever
set
eyes
on
them
again
.
    
<EOS>
About
the
same
time
,
a
gentleman
of
family
,
who
had
been
oppressed
by
a
certain
powerful
duke
that
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
,
found
means
to
be
introduced
to
the
king
,
who
receiving
his
petition
very
graciously
,
asked
in
what
regiment
he
served
;
and
when
the
memorialist
answered
,
that
he
had
not
the
honour
of
being
in
the
service
,
returned
the
paper
unopened
,
and
refused
to
hear
one
circumstance
of
his
complaint
;
so
that
,
far
from
being
redressed
,
he
remained
more
than
ever
exposed
to
the
tyranny
of
his
oppressors
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
notorious
is
the
discouragement
of
all
those
who
presume
to
live
independent
of
court
-
favour
and
connexions
,
that
one
of
the
gentlemen
,
whose
friendship
Peregrine
cultivated
,
frankly
owned
he
was
in
possession
of
a
most
romantic
place
in
one
of
the
provinces
,
and
deeply
enamoured
of
a
country
life
;
and
yet
he
durst
not
reside
upon
his
own
estate
,
lest
by
slackening
in
his
attendance
upon
the
great
,
who
honoured
him
with
their
protection
,
he
should
fall
a
prey
to
some
rapacious
intendant
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
common
people
,
they
are
so
much
inured
to
the
scourge
and
insolence
of
power
,
<EOS>
that
every
shabby
subaltern
,
every
beggarly
cadet
of
the
noblesse
,
every
low
retainer
to
the
court
,
insults
and
injures
them
with
impunity
.
<EOS>
A
certain
Ecuyer
,
or
horse
-
dealer
,
belonging
to
the
king
,
being
one
day
under
the
hands
of
a
barber
,
who
by
accident
cut
the
head
of
a
pimple
on
his
face
<EOS>
,
he
started
up
,
and
drawing
his
sword
,
wounded
him
desperately
in
the
shoulder
.
<EOS>
The
poor
tradesman
,
hurt
as
he
was
,
made
an
effort
to
retire
,
and
was
followed
by
this
barbarous
assassin
,
who
not
contented
with
the
vengeance
he
had
taken
,
plunged
his
sword
a
second
time
into
his
body
,
and
killed
him
on
the
spot
.
    
<EOS>
Having
performed
this
inhuman
exploit
,
he
dressed
himself
with
great
deliberation
,
and
going
to
Versailles
,
immediately
obtained
a
pardon
for
what
he
had
done
;
triumphing
in
his
brutality
with
such
insolence
,
that
the
very
next
time
he
had
occasion
to
be
shaved
,
he
sat
with
his
sword
ready
drawn
,
in
order
to
repeat
the
murder
,
in
case
the
barber
should
commit
the
same
mistake
.
<EOS>
Yet
so
tamed
are
those
poor
people
to
subjection
,
that
when
Peregrine
mentioned
this
assassination
to
his
own
trimmer
,
with
expressions
of
horror
and
detestation
,
the
infatuated
wretch
replied
,
that
without
all
doubt
it
was
a
misfortune
,
but
it
proceeded
from
the
gentleman
's
passion
;
and
observed
,
by
way
of
encomium
on
the
government
,
that
such
vivacity
is
never
punished
in
France
.
    
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
this
outrage
was
committed
,
our
youth
,
who
was
a
professed
enemy
to
all
oppression
,
being
in
one
of
the
first
loges
at
the
comedy
,
was
eye
-
witness
of
an
adventure
which
filled
him
with
indignation
:
a
tall
,
ferocious
fellow
in
the
parterre
,
without
the
least
provocation
,
but
prompted
by
the
meer
wantonness
of
pride
,
took
hold
of
the
hat
of
a
very
decent
young
man
who
happened
to
stand
before
him
,
and
twirled
it
round
upon
his
head
.
<EOS>
The
party
thus
offended
turned
to
his
aggressor
,
and
civilly
asked
the
reason
of
such
treatment
;
but
he
received
no
answer
;
and
when
he
looked
the
other
way
,
the
insult
was
repeated
:
upon
which
he
expressed
his
resentment
as
became
a
man
of
spirit
,
and
desired
the
offender
to
walk
out
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
No
sooner
did
he
thus
signify
his
intention
,
than
his
adversary
,
swelling
with
rage
,
cocked
his
hat
fiercely
in
his
face
,
and
fixing
his
hands
in
his
sides
,
pronounced
with
the
most
imperious
tone
,
"
Heark
ye
,
Mr
Round
Periwig
<EOS>
,
you
must
know
that
I
am
a
mousquetaire
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Scarce
had
this
awful
word
escaped
from
his
lips
,
when
the
blood
forsook
the
lips
of
the
poor
challenger
,
who
with
the
most
abject
submission
begged
pardon
for
his
presumption
,
and
with
difficulty
obtained
it
,
on
condition
that
he
should
immediately
quit
the
place
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
exercised
his
authority
,
he
turned
to
one
of
his
companions
,
and
with
an
air
of
disdainful
ridicule
,
told
him
he
was
like
to
have
had
an
affair
with
a
Bourgeois
;
adding
,
by
way
of
heightening
the
irony
,
"
Egad
!
<EOS>
I
believe
he
's
a
physician
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
was
so
much
shocked
and
irritated
at
this
licentious
behaviour
,
that
he
could
not
suppress
his
resentment
,
which
he
manifested
,
by
saying
to
this
Hector
,
"
Sir
,
a
physician
may
be
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
remonstrance
,
which
was
delivered
with
a
very
significant
countenance
,
the
mousquetaire
made
no
other
reply
,
but
that
of
ecchoing
his
assertion
with
a
loud
laugh
,
in
which
he
was
joined
by
his
confederates
;
and
Peregrine
glowing
with
resentment
,
called
him
a
Fanfaron
,
and
withdrew
,
in
expectation
of
being
followed
into
the
street
.
<EOS>
The
other
understood
the
hint
,
and
a
rencounter
must
have
ensued
,
had
not
the
officer
of
the
guard
,
who
overheard
what
passed
,
prevented
their
meeting
,
by
putting
the
mousquetaire
immediately
under
arrest
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
waited
at
the
door
of
the
parterre
,
until
he
was
informed
of
this
interposition
,
and
then
went
home
very
much
chagrined
at
his
disappintment
;
for
he
was
an
utter
stranger
to
fear
and
diffidence
on
these
occasions
,
and
had
set
his
heart
upon
chastising
the
insolence
of
this
bully
,
who
had
treated
him
with
such
disrespect
.
    
<EOS>
This
adventure
was
not
so
private
but
that
it
reached
the
ears
of
Mr
Jolter
,
by
the
canal
of
some
English
gentlemen
who
were
present
when
it
happened
;
and
the
governor
,
who
entertained
a
most
dreadful
idea
of
the
mousquetaires
,
being
alarmed
at
a
quarrel
,
the
consequence
of
which
might
be
fatal
to
his
charge
,
waited
on
the
British
embassador
,
and
begged
he
would
take
Peregrine
under
his
immediate
protection
.
<EOS>
His
excellency
having
heard
the
circumstances
of
the
dispute
,
sent
one
of
his
gentlemen
to
invite
the
youth
to
dinner
;
and
after
having
assured
him
that
he
might
depend
upon
his
countenance
and
regard
,
represented
the
rashness
and
impetuosity
of
his
conduct
so
much
to
his
conviction
,
that
he
promised
to
act
more
circumspectly
for
the
future
,
and
drop
all
thoughts
of
the
mousquetaire
from
that
moment
.
    
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
he
had
taken
this
laudable
resolution
,
Pipes
,
who
had
carried
a
billet
to
his
mistress
,
informed
him
,
that
he
had
perceived
a
laced
hat
lying
upon
a
marble
slab
in
her
apartment
;
and
that
when
she
came
out
of
her
own
chamber
to
receive
the
letter
,
she
appeared
in
manifest
disorder
.
    
<EOS>
From
these
hints
of
intelligence
,
our
young
gentleman
suspected
,
or
rather
made
no
doubt
of
her
infidelity
;
and
being
by
this
time
<EOS>
well
nigh
cloyed
with
possession
,
was
not
sorry
to
find
that
she
had
given
him
cause
to
renounce
her
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
That
he
might
therefore
detect
her
in
the
very
breach
of
duty
,
and
at
the
same
time
punish
the
gallant
who
had
the
presumption
to
invade
his
territories
,
he
concerted
with
himself
a
plan
,
which
was
executed
in
this
manner
:
During
his
next
interview
with
his
Dulcinea
,
far
from
discovering
the
least
sign
of
jealousy
or
discontent
,
he
affected
the
appearance
of
extraordinary
fondness
;
and
after
having
spent
the
afternoon
with
the
shew
of
uncommon
satisfaction
,
told
her
he
was
engaged
in
a
party
for
Fountainbleau
,
and
would
set
out
from
Paris
that
same
evening
;
so
that
he
should
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
again
for
some
days
.
    
<EOS>
The
lady
,
who
was
very
well
versed
in
the
arts
of
her
occupation
,
pretended
to
receive
this
piece
of
news
with
great
affliction
,
and
conjured
him
with
such
marks
of
real
tenderness
,
to
return
as
soon
as
possible
to
her
longing
arms
,
that
he
went
away
almost
convinced
of
her
sincerity
.
<EOS>
Determined
,
however
,
to
prosecute
his
scheme
,
he
actually
departed
from
Paris
with
two
or
three
gentlemen
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
had
hired
a
Remise
for
a
jaunt
to
Versailles
;
and
having
accompanied
them
as
far
as
the
village
of
Passe
,
returned
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
on
foot
.
    
<EOS>
He
waited
impatiently
till
midnight
,
and
then
arming
himself
with
a
pair
of
pocket
-
pistols
,
and
attended
by
trusty
Tom
with
a
cudgel
in
his
hand
,
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
his
suspected
inamorata
;
and
having
given
Pipes
his
cue
,
knocked
gently
at
the
door
,
which
was
no
sooner
opened
by
the
lacquey
than
he
bolted
in
,
before
the
fellow
could
recollect
himself
from
the
confusion
occasioned
by
his
unexpected
appearance
;
and
leaving
Tom
to
guard
the
door
,
ordered
the
trembling
valet
to
light
him
up
stairs
into
his
lady
's
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
view
,
when
he
entered
the
antichamber
,
was
a
sword
upon
the
table
,
which
he
immediately
seized
,
exclaiming
in
a
loud
and
menacing
voice
,
that
his
mistress
was
false
,
and
then
in
bed
with
another
gallant
,
whom
he
would
instantly
put
to
death
.
<EOS>
This
declaration
,
confirmed
by
many
terrible
oaths
,
he
calculated
for
the
hearing
of
his
rival
,
who
understanding
his
sanguinary
purpose
,
started
up
in
great
trepidation
,
and
naked
as
he
was
,
dropt
from
the
balcony
into
the
street
,
while
Peregrine
thundered
at
the
door
for
admittance
;
and
guessing
his
design
,
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
making
this
precipitate
retreat
.
<EOS>
Pipes
,
who
stood
centinel
at
the
door
,
observing
the
fugitive
descend
,
attacked
him
with
his
cudgel
,
and
sweating
him
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
,
at
last
committed
him
to
the
guet
,
by
whom
he
was
conveyed
to
the
officer
on
duty
in
a
most
disgraceful
and
deplorable
condition
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Peregrine
<EOS>
having
burst
open
the
chamber
-
door
,
found
the
lady
in
the
utmost
dread
and
consternation
,
and
the
spoils
of
her
favourite
scattered
about
the
room
:
but
his
resentment
was
doubly
gratified
,
when
he
learnt
upon
inquiry
,
that
the
person
who
had
been
so
disagreeably
interrupted
,
was
no
other
than
that
individual
mousquetaire
with
whom
he
had
quarreled
at
the
comedy
.
<EOS>
He
upbraided
the
nymph
with
her
perfidy
and
ingratitude
,
and
telling
her
that
she
must
not
expect
the
continuance
of
his
regard
,
or
the
appointments
which
she
had
hitherto
enjoyed
from
his
bounty
,
went
home
to
his
own
lodgings
,
overjoyed
at
the
issue
of
the
adventure
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
,
exasperated
at
the
disgrace
he
had
undergone
,
as
well
as
at
the
outragious
insult
of
the
English
valet
,
whom
he
believed
his
master
had
tutored
for
that
purpose
,
no
sooner
extricated
himself
from
the
opprobrious
situation
he
had
incurred
,
than
breathing
vengeance
against
the
author
of
the
affront
,
he
came
to
Peregrine
's
apartment
,
and
demanded
satisfaction
upon
the
ramparts
next
morning
before
sun
-
rise
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
assured
him
,
he
would
not
fail
to
pay
his
respects
to
him
at
the
time
and
place
appointed
;
and
foreseeing
that
he
might
be
prevented
from
keeping
this
engagement
by
the
officious
care
of
his
governor
,
who
saw
the
mousquetaire
come
in
,
he
told
Mr
Jolter
,
that
the
Frenchman
had
visited
him
in
consequence
of
an
order
he
had
received
from
his
superiors
,
to
make
an
apology
for
his
rude
behaviour
to
him
in
the
playhouse
,
and
that
they
had
parted
very
good
friends
.
<EOS>
This
assurance
,
together
with
Pickle
's
tranquil
and
unconcerned
behaviour
thro
'
the
day
,
quieted
the
terrors
which
had
begun
to
take
possession
of
his
tutor
's
imagination
;
so
that
the
youth
had
an
opportunity
of
giving
him
the
slip
at
night
,
when
he
betook
himself
to
the
lodgings
of
a
friend
,
whom
he
engaged
as
his
second
,
and
with
whom
he
immediately
took
the
field
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
search
which
Jolter
,
upon
missing
him
,
might
set
on
foot
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
necessary
precaution
;
for
as
he
did
not
appear
at
supper
,
and
Pipes
,
who
usually
attended
him
in
his
excursions
,
could
give
no
account
of
his
motions
,
the
governor
was
dreadfully
alarmed
at
his
absence
,
and
ordered
his
man
to
run
in
quest
of
his
master
to
all
the
places
which
he
used
to
frequent
,
while
he
himself
went
to
the
commissaire
,
and
communicating
his
suspicions
,
was
accommodated
with
a
party
of
the
horse
-
guards
,
who
patroled
round
all
the
environs
of
the
city
,
with
a
view
of
preventing
the
rencounter
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
might
have
directed
them
to
the
lady
,
by
whose
information
they
could
have
learnt
the
name
and
lodgings
of
the
mousquetaire
,
who
being
apprehended
,
the
duel
would
not
have
happened
;
but
he
did
not
choose
to
run
the
risk
of
disobliging
his
master
,
by
intermeddling
in
the
affair
,
and
was
,
moreover
,
very
desirous
that
the
Frenchman
should
be
humbled
;
for
he
never
doubted
that
Peregrine
was
more
than
a
match
for
any
two
men
in
France
.
<EOS>
In
this
confidence
,
therefore
,
he
sought
his
master
with
great
diligence
,
not
with
a
view
of
disappointing
his
intention
,
but
in
order
to
attend
him
to
the
battle
,
that
he
might
stand
by
him
,
and
see
justice
done
.
    
<EOS>
While
this
inquiry
was
carried
on
,
our
hero
and
his
companion
concealed
themselves
among
some
weeds
that
grew
on
the
edge
of
the
parapet
,
a
few
yards
from
the
spot
where
he
had
agreed
to
meet
the
mousquetaire
;
and
scarce
had
the
morning
rendered
objects
distinguishable
,
when
they
perceived
their
men
advancing
boldly
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
seeing
them
approach
,
sprung
forward
to
the
ground
,
that
he
might
have
the
glory
of
anticipating
his
antagonist
;
and
swords
being
drawn
,
all
four
were
engaged
in
a
twinkling
.
<EOS>
Pickle
's
eagerness
had
well
nigh
cost
him
his
life
;
for
,
without
minding
his
footing
,
he
flew
directly
to
his
opposite
,
and
stumbling
over
a
stone
,
was
wounded
on
one
side
of
his
head
before
he
could
recover
his
attitude
.
    
<EOS>
Far
from
being
disspirited
at
this
check
,
it
served
only
to
animate
him
the
more
;
being
endowed
with
uncommon
agility
,
he
retrieved
his
posture
in
a
moment
,
and
having
parried
a
second
thrust
,
returned
the
longe
with
such
incredible
speed
,
that
the
soldier
had
not
time
to
resume
his
guard
,
but
was
immediately
run
through
the
bend
of
his
right
arm
;
and
the
sword
dropping
out
of
his
hand
,
our
hero
's
victory
was
compleat
.
    
<EOS>
Having
dispatched
his
own
business
,
and
received
the
acknowledgment
of
his
adversary
,
who
with
a
look
of
infinite
mortification
observed
,
that
his
was
the
fortune
of
the
day
,
he
ran
to
part
the
seconds
,
just
as
the
weapon
was
twisted
out
of
his
companion
's
hand
:
upon
which
he
took
his
place
;
and
,
in
all
likelihood
,
an
obstinate
dispute
would
have
ensued
,
had
they
not
been
interrupted
by
the
guard
,
at
sight
of
whom
the
two
Frenchmen
scampered
off
,
while
our
young
gentleman
and
his
friend
allowed
themselves
to
be
taken
prisoners
by
the
detachment
which
had
been
sent
out
for
that
purpose
,
and
were
carried
before
the
magistrate
,
who
having
sharply
reprimanded
them
for
presuming
to
act
in
contempt
of
the
laws
,
set
them
at
liberty
,
in
consideration
of
their
being
strangers
,
cautioning
them
at
the
same
time
to
beware
of
such
exploits
for
the
future
.
    
<EOS>
When
Peregrine
returned
to
his
own
lodgings
,
Pipes
seeing
the
blood
trickling
down
upon
his
master
's
neckcloth
and
solitaire
,
gave
evident
tokens
of
surprize
and
concern
,
not
for
the
consequences
of
the
wound
,
which
he
did
not
suppose
dangerous
,
but
for
the
glory
of
Old
England
,
which
he
was
afraid
had
suffered
in
the
engagement
;
for
,
he
could
not
help
saying
,
with
an
air
of
chagrin
,
as
he
followed
the
youth
into
his
chamber
,
"
I
do
suppose
as
how
you
gave
that
lubberly
Frenchman
as
good
as
he
brought
.

Chapter
XLV
   
<EOS>
Though
Mr
Jolter
was
extremely
well
pleased
at
the
safety
of
his
pupil
,
he
could
not
forgive
him
for
the
terror
and
anxiety
he
had
undergone
on
his
account
;
and
roundly
told
him
,
that
notwithstanding
the
inclination
and
attachment
he
had
to
his
person
,
he
would
immediately
depart
for
England
,
if
ever
he
should
hear
of
his
being
involved
in
such
another
adventure
;
for
it
could
not
be
expected
that
he
would
sacrifice
his
own
quiet
,
to
an
unrequited
regard
for
one
who
seemed
determined
to
keep
him
in
continual
uneasiness
and
apprehension
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
declaration
Pickle
made
answer
,
that
Mr
Jolter
,
by
this
time
,
ought
to
be
convinced
of
the
attention
he
had
always
paid
to
his
ease
and
satisfaction
;
since
he
well
knew
,
that
he
had
ever
looked
upon
him
in
the
light
of
a
friend
rather
than
as
a
counsellor
or
tutor
,
and
desired
his
company
in
France
with
a
view
of
promoting
his
interest
,
and
not
for
any
emolument
he
could
expect
from
his
instruction
.
    
<EOS>
This
being
the
case
,
he
was
at
liberty
to
consult
his
own
inclinations
with
regard
to
going
or
staying
;
though
he
could
not
help
owning
himself
obliged
by
the
concern
he
expressed
for
his
safety
,
and
would
endeavour
,
for
his
own
sake
,
to
avoid
giving
him
any
cause
of
disturbance
in
time
to
come
.
    
<EOS>
No
man
was
more
capable
of
moralizing
upon
Peregrine
's
misconduct
than
himself
;
his
reflections
were
extremely
just
and
sagacious
,
and
attended
with
no
other
disadvantage
,
but
that
of
occurring
too
late
.
<EOS>
He
projected
a
thousand
salutary
schemes
of
deportment
,
but
,
like
other
projectors
,
he
never
had
interest
enough
with
the
ministry
of
his
passions
to
bring
any
one
of
them
to
bear
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
in
the
heyday
of
his
gallantry
,
received
a
letter
from
his
friend
Gauntlet
,
with
a
kind
postscript
from
his
charming
Emilia
;
but
it
arrived
at
a
very
unseasonable
juncture
,
when
his
imagination
was
engrossed
by
conquests
that
more
agreeably
flattered
his
ambition
;
so
that
he
could
not
find
leisure
and
inclination
,
from
that
day
,
to
honour
the
correspondence
which
he
himself
had
sollicited
;
and
his
vanity
had
,
by
this
time
,
disapproved
of
the
engagement
he
had
contracted
in
the
rawness
and
inexperience
of
youth
;
suggesting
,
that
he
was
born
to
make
such
an
important
figure
in
life
,
as
ought
to
raise
his
ideas
above
the
consideration
of
any
such
middling
connections
,
and
fix
his
attention
upon
objects
of
the
most
sublime
attraction
.
<EOS>
These
dictates
of
ridiculous
pride
had
almost
effaced
the
remembrance
of
his
amiable
mistress
,
or
at
least
so
far
warped
his
morals
and
integrity
,
that
he
actually
began
to
conceive
hopes
of
her
altogether
unworthy
of
his
own
character
and
her
deserts
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
being
destitute
of
a
toy
for
the
dalliance
of
his
idle
hours
,
he
employed
several
spies
,
and
almost
every
day
made
a
tour
of
the
public
places
in
person
,
with
a
view
of
procuring
intelligence
of
Mr
Hornbeck
,
with
whose
wife
he
longed
to
have
another
interview
;
and
in
this
course
of
expectation
had
he
exercised
himself
a
whole
fortnight
,
when
chancing
to
be
at
the
hospital
of
the
invalids
with
a
gentleman
lately
arrived
from
England
,
he
no
sooner
entered
the
church
than
he
perceived
this
lady
,
attended
by
her
spouse
,
who
at
sight
of
our
hero
changed
colour
,
and
looked
another
way
,
in
order
to
discourage
any
communication
between
them
.
<EOS>
But
the
young
man
,
who
was
not
so
easily
repulsed
,
advanced
with
great
assurance
to
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
and
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
this
unexpected
meeting
;
and
kindly
upbraiding
him
for
his
precipitate
retreat
from
Chantilly
,
before
Hornbeck
could
make
any
reply
,
he
went
up
to
his
wife
,
whom
he
complimented
in
the
same
manner
,
assuring
her
with
some
significant
glances
,
he
was
extremely
mortified
,
that
she
had
put
it
out
of
his
power
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
,
on
his
first
arrival
at
Paris
;
and
then
turning
to
her
husband
,
who
thought
proper
to
keep
close
to
him
in
this
conference
,
begged
to
know
where
he
could
have
the
honour
of
waiting
upon
him
;
observing
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
himself
lived
a
l'academie
de
Palfrenier
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Hornbeck
,
without
making
an
apology
for
his
elopement
on
the
road
,
thanked
Mr
Pickle
for
his
complaisance
in
a
very
cool
and
disobliging
manner
;
saying
,
that
as
he
intended
to
shift
his
lodgings
in
a
day
or
two
,
he
could
not
expect
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
,
until
he
should
be
settled
,
when
he
would
call
at
the
academy
,
and
conduct
him
to
his
new
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
was
not
unacquainted
with
the
sentiments
of
this
jealous
gentleman
,
did
not
put
much
confidence
in
his
promise
,
and
therefore
made
divers
efforts
to
enjoy
a
little
private
conversation
with
his
wife
;
but
he
was
baffled
in
all
his
attempts
by
the
indefatigable
vigilance
of
her
keeper
,
and
reaped
no
other
immediate
pleasure
from
this
accidental
meeting
,
than
that
of
a
kind
squeeze
while
he
handed
her
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
he
had
been
witness
to
some
instances
of
her
invention

the

of

he
entertained
some
faint
hopes
of

and
was
not

in
his

;
for
the
very
next
forenoon
a
Savoyard
called
at
the
academy
,
and
put
the
following

Our
young
gentleman
was
ravished
at
the
receit
of
this
elegant
epistle
,
which
was
directed
,
A
Monsieur
Monsieur
Pickhell
,
a
la
Gaddamme
de
Paul
Freny
,
and
did
not
fail
to
obey
the
summons
at
the
hour
of
assignation
;
when
the
lady
,
true
to
her
appointment
,
beckoned
him
up
stairs
,
and
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
admitted
unseen
.
    
<EOS>
After
the
first
transports
of
their
mutual
joy
at
meeting
,
she
told
him
,
that
her
husband
had
been
very
surly
and
cross
ever
since
the
adventure
at
Chantilly
,
which
he
had
not
yet
digested
;
that
he
had
laid
severe
injunctions
upon
her
to
avoid
all
commerce
with
Pickle
,
and
even
threatened
to
shut
her
up
in
a
convent
for
life
,
if
ever
she
should
discover
the
least
inclination
to
renew
that
acquaintance
;
that
she
had
been
cooped
up
in
her
chamber
since
her
arrival
at
Paris
,
without
being
permitted
to
see
the
place
,
or
indeed
any
company
,
except
that
of
her
landlady
,
whose
language
she
did
not
understand
;
so
that
her
spirit
being
broke
,
and
her
health
impaired
,
he
was
prevailed
upon
some
days
ago
to
indulge
her
in
a
few
airings
,
during
which
she
had
seen
the
gardens
of
the
Luxembourg
,
the
Thuilleries
and
Palais
Royal
,
though
at
those
times
when
there
was
no
company
in
the
walks
;
and
that
it
was
in
one
of
those
excursions
she
had
the
happiness
of
meeting
with
him
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
she
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
rather
than
continue
longer
in
such
confinement
with
the
man
whom
she
could
not
love
,
she
would
instantly
give
him
the
slip
,
and
put
herself
under
the
protection
of
her
lover
.
    
<EOS>
Rash
and
unthinking
as
this
declaration
might
be
,
the
young
gentleman
was
so
much
of
a
gallant
,
that
he
would
not
baulk
the
lady
's
inclinations
,
and
too
infatuated
by
his
passion
to
foresee
the
consequences
of
such
a
dangerous
step
;
he
therefore
,
without
hesitation
,
embraced
the
proposal
,
and
the
coast
being
clear
,
they
sallied
into
the
street
,
where
Peregrine
calling
a
Fiacre
,
ordered
the
coachman
to
drive
them
to
a
tavern
:
but
knowing
it
would
not
be
in
his
power
to
conceal
her
from
the
search
of
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
if
she
should
remain
within
the
walls
of
Paris
,
he
hired
a
Remise
,
and
carried
her
that
same
evening
to
Villejuif
,
about
four
leagues
from
town
,
where
he
stayed
with
her
all
night
;
and
having
boarded
her
on
a
genteel
pension
,
and
settled
the
oeconomy
of
his
future
visits
,
returned
next
day
to
his
own
lodgings
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
enjoyed
his
success
,
her
husband
endured
the
tortures
of
the
damned
.
<EOS>
When
he
returned
from
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
understood
that
his
wife
had
eloped
,
without
being
perceived
by
any
person
in
the
family
,
he
began
to
rave
and
foam
at
the
mouth
with
rage
and
jealousy
,
and
in
the
fury
of
distraction
,
accused
the
landlady
of
being
an
accomplice
in
her
escape
,
threatening
to
complain
of
her
to
the
commissaire
.
<EOS>
The
woman
could
not
conceive
how
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
who
she
knew
was
an
utter
stranger
to
the
French
language
,
and
kept
no
sort
of
company
,
could
elude
the
caution
of
her
husband
,
and
find
any
refuge
in
a
place
where
she
had
no
acquaintance
,
and
began
to
suspect
the
lodger
's
emotion
was
no
other
than
an
affected
passion
to
conceal
his
own
practices
upon
his
wife
,
who
had
perhaps
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
his
jealous
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
spared
him
the
trouble
of
putting
his
menaces
in
execution
,
by
going
to
the
magistrate
without
any
further
deliberation
,
and
giving
an
account
of
what
she
knew
concerning
this
mysterious
affair
,
with
certain
insinuations
against
Hornbeck
's
character
,
which
she
represented
as
peevish
and
capricious
to
the
last
degree
.
    
<EOS>
While
she
thus
anticipated
the
purpose
of
the
plaintiff
,
her
information
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
party
himself
,
who
exhibited
his
complaint
with
such
evident
marks
of
perturbation
,
anger
and
impatience
,
that
the
commissaire
could
easily
perceive
that
he
had
no
share
in
the
disappearance
of
his
wife
;
and
directed
him
to
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
whose
province
it
is
to
take
cognizance
of
such
occurrences
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
who
presides
over
the
city
of
Paris
,
having
heard
the
particulars
of
Hornbeck
's
misfortune
,
asked
if
he
suspected
any
individual
person
as
the
seducer
of
his
yoke
-
fellow
;
and
when
he
mentioned
Peregrine
as
the
object
of
his
suspicion
,
granted
a
warrant
and
a
detachment
of
soldiers
,
to
search
for
and
retrieve
the
fugitive
.
    
<EOS>
The
husband
conducted
them
immediately
to
the
academy
where
our
hero
lodged
,
and
having
rummaged
the
whole
place
,
to
the
astonishment
of
Mr
Jolter
,
without
finding
either
his
wife
or
the
supposed
ravisher
,
accompanied
them
to
all
the
public
houses
in
the
Fauxbourg
;
which
having
examined
also
without
success
<EOS>
,
he
returned
to
the
magistrate
in
a
state
of
despair
,
and
obtained
a
promise
of
his
making
such
an
effectual
inquiry
,
that
in
three
days
he
should
have
an
account
of
her
,
provided
she
was
alive
,
and
within
the
walls
of
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
who
had
foreseen
all
this
disturbance
,
was
not
at
all
surprized
when
his
governor
told
him
what
had
happened
;
and
being
conjured
to
restore
the
woman
to
the
right
owner
,
with
many
pathetic
remonstrances
touching
the
heinous
sin
of
adultery
,
the
distraction
of
the
unfortunate
husband
,
and
the
danger
of
incurring
the
resentment
of
an
arbitrary
government
,
which
,
upon
application
being
made
,
would
not
fail
of
espousing
the
cause
of
the
injured
;
he
denied
,
with
great
effrontery
,
that
he
had
the
least
concern
in
the
matter
,
pretended
to
resent
the
deportment
of
Hornbeck
,
whom
he
threatened
to
chastise
for
his
scandalous
suspicion
,
and
expressed
his
displeasure
at
the
credulity
of
Jolter
,
who
seemed
to
doubt
the
veracity
of
his
asseveration
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
confident
behaviour
,
Jolter
could
not
help
entertaining
doubts
of
his
sincerity
;
and
visiting
the
disconsolate
swain
,
begged
he
would
,
for
the
honour
of
his
country
,
as
well
as
for
the
sake
of
his
own
reputation
,
discontinue
his
addresses
to
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
and
apply
to
the
British
Embassador
,
who
by
dint
of
friendly
admonitions
,
would
certainly
prevail
upon
Mr
Pickle
to
do
him
all
the
justice
in
his
power
,
if
he
was
really
the
author
of
the
injury
he
had
sustained
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
urged
this
advice
with
the
appearance
of
so
much
sympathy
and
concern
,
promising
to
co
-
operate
with
all
his
influence
in
his
behalf
,
that
Hornbeck
embraced
the
proposal
,
communicated
his
purpose
to
the
magistrate
,
who
commended
the
resolution
as
the
most
decent
and
desirable
expedient
he
could
use
,
and
then
waited
upon
his
excellency
,
who
readily
espoused
his
cause
,
and
sending
for
the
young
gentleman
that
same
evening
,
read
him
such
a
lecture
in
private
,
as
extorted
a
confession
of
the
whole
affair
;
not
that
he
assailed
him
with
sour
and
supercilious
maxims
,
or
severe
rebuke
,
because
he
had
penetration
enough
to
discern
,
that
Peregrine
's
disposition
was
impregnable
to
all
such
attacks
;
but
he
first
of
all
rallied
him
upon
his
intriguing
genius
,
then
,
in
an
humorous
manner
,
described
the
distraction
of
the
poor
cuckold
,
who
he
owned
was
justly
punished
for
the
absurdity
of
his
conduct
;
and
lastly
,
upon
the
supposition
,
that
it
would
be
no
great
effort
in
Pickle
to
part
with
such
a
conquest
,
especially
after
it
was
for
some
time
possessed
,
represented
the
necessity
and
expediency
of
restoring
her
,
not
only
out
of
regard
to
his
own
character
,
and
that
of
his
nation
,
but
also
with
a
view
to
his
ease
,
which
would
in
a
little
time
be
very
much
invaded
by
such
an
incumbrance
,
that
in
all
probability
would
involve
him
in
a
thousand
difficulties
and
disgusts
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
he
assured
him
,
that
he
was
already
,
by
order
of
the
lieutenant
de
police
,
surrounded
with
spies
,
who
would
watch
all
his
motions
,
and
immediately
discover
the
retreat
in
which
he
had
deposited
his
prize
.
<EOS>
These
arguments
,
and
the
frank
familiar
manner
in
which
they
were
delivered
,
but
above
all
,
the
last
consideration
,
induced
the
young
gentleman
to
disclose
the
whole
of
his
proceedings
to
the
Embassador
,
and
promise
to
be
governed
by
his
direction
,
provided
the
lady
should
not
suffer
for
the
step
she
had
taken
,
but
be
received
by
her
husband
with
due
reverence
and
respect
.
    
<EOS>
These
stipulations
being
agreed
to
,
he
undertook
to
produce
her
in
eight
and
forty
hours
;
and
taking
coach
immediately
,
drove
to
the
place
of
her
residence
,
where
he
spent
a
whole
day
and
a
night
in
convincing
her
of
the
impossibility
of
their
enjoying
each
other
in
that
manner
;
and
returning
to
Paris
,
delivered
her
into
the
hands
of
the
Embassador
,
who
having
assured
her
,
that
she
might
depend
upon
his
friendship
and
protection
,
in
case
she
should
find
herself
aggrieved
by
the
jealous
temper
of
Mr
Hornbeck
,
restored
her
to
her
legitimate
lord
,
whom
he
counselled
to
exempt
her
from
that
restraint
which
,
in
all
probability
,
had
been
the
cause
of
her
elopement
,
and
endeavour
to
conciliate
her
affection
by
tender
and
respectful
usage
.
    
<EOS>
The
husband
behaved
with
great
humility
and
compliance
,
protesting
that
his
chief
study
should
be
to
contrive
parties
for
her
pleasure
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
But
no
sooner
did
he
regain
possession
of
his
stray
-
sheep
,
than
he
locked
her
up
more
closely
than
ever
;
and
after
having
revolved
various
schemes
for
her
reformation
,
determined
to
board
her
in
a
convent
,
under
the
inspection
of
a
prudent
abbess
,
who
should
superintend
her
morals
,
and
recal
her
to
the
paths
of
virtue
,
which
she
had
forsaken
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
consulted
an
English
priest
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
advised
him
to
settle
her
in
a
monastery
at
Lisle
,
that
she
might
be
as
far
as
possible
from
the
machinations
of
her
lover
;
and
gave
him
a
letter
of
recommendation
to
the
superior
of
a
certain
convent
in
that
place
,
for
which
Mr
Hornbeck
set
out
in
a
few
days
with
his
troublesome
charge
.

Chapter
XLVI
Peregrine
resolves
to
return
to
England
,
is
diverted
with
the
odd
characters
of
two
of
his
countrymen
,
with
whom
he
contracts
an
acquaintance
in
the
apartments
of
the
Palais
Royal
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
our
hero
received
a
letter
from
his
aunt
,
importing
that
the
commodore
was
in
a
very
declining
way
,
and
longed
much
to
see
him
at
the
garison
;
and
at
the
same
time
he
heard
from
his
sister
,
who
gave
him
to
understand
that
the
young
gentleman
who
had
for
some
time
made
his
addresses
to
her
,
was
become
very
pressing
in
his
solicitations
;
so
that
she
wanted
to
know
in
what
manner
she
should
answer
his
repeated
intreaties
.
<EOS>
These
two
considerations
determined
the
young
gentleman
to
return
to
his
native
country
,
a
resolution
that
was
far
from
being
disagreeable
to
Jolter
,
who
knew
that
the
incumbent
on
a
living
which
was
in
the
gift
of
Trunnion
,
was
extremely
old
,
and
that
it
would
be
his
interest
to
be
upon
the
spot
at
the
said
incumbent
's
decease
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
had
resided
about
fifteen
months
in
France
,
thought
he
was
now
sufficiently
qualified
for
eclipsing
most
of
his
cotemporaries
in
England
,
and
therefore
prepared
for
his
departure
with
infinite
alacrity
,
being
moreover
inflamed
with
the
most
ardent
desire
of
revisiting
his
friends
,
and
renewing
his
connections
,
particularly
with
Emilia
,
<EOS>
whose
heart
,
he
by
this
time
,
thought
he
was
able
to
reduce
on
his
own
terms
.
    
<EOS>
As
he
proposed
to
make
the
tour
of
Flanders
and
Holland
in
his
return
to
England
,
he
resolved
to
stay
in
Paris
a
week
or
two
after
his
affairs
were
settled
,
in
hopes
of
finding
some
agreeable
companion
disposed
for
the
same
journey
,
and
in
order
to
refresh
his
memory
,
made
a
second
circuit
round
all
the
places
in
that
capital
,
where
any
curious
production
of
art
is
to
be
seen
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
second
examination
he
chanced
to
enter
the
Palais
Royal
,
just
as
two
gentlemen
alighted
from
a
Fiacre
at
the
gate
,
and
all
three
being
admitted
at
the
same
time
,
he
soon
perceived
that
the
strangers
were
of
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
One
of
them
was
a
young
man
,
in
whose
air
and
countenance
appeared
all
the
uncouth
gravity
and
supercilious
self
-
conceit
of
a
physician
piping
hot
from
his
studies
,
while
the
other
,
to
whom
his
companion
spoke
by
the
appellation
of
Mr
Pallet
,
displayed
at
first
sight
a
strange
composition
of
levity
and
assurance
.
<EOS>
Indeed
their
characters
,
dress
and
address
were
strongly
contrasted
;
the
doctor
wore
a
suit
of
black
,
and
a
huge
tyewig
,
neither
suitable
to
his
own
age
,
nor
the
fashion
of
the
country
where
he
then
lived
;
whereas
the
other
,
though
seemingly
turned
of
fifty
,
strutted
in
a
gay
summer
dress
of
the
Parisian
cut
,
with
a
bag
to
his
own
grey
hair
,
and
a
red
feather
in
his
hat
,
which
he
carried
under
his
arm
.
<EOS>
As
these
figures
seemed
to
promise
something
entertaining
,
Pickle
entered
into
conversation
with
them
immediately
,
and
soon
discovered
that
the
old
gentleman
was
a
painter
from
London
,
who
had
stole
a
fortnight
from
his
occupation
,
in
order
to
visit
the
remarkable
paintings
of
France
and
Flanders
;
and
that
the
doctor
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
accompanying
him
in
his
tour
.
<EOS>
Being
extremely
talkative
,
he
not
only
communicated
these
particulars
to
our
hero
in
a
very
few
minutes
after
their
meeting
,
but
also
took
occasion
to
whisper
in
his
ear
,
that
his
fellow
traveller
was
a
man
of
vast
learning
,
and
beyond
all
doubt
,
the
greatest
poet
of
the
age
.
<EOS>
As
for
himself
,
he
was
under
no
necessity
of
making
his
own
elogium
;
for
he
soon
gave
such
specimens
of
his
taste
and
talents
,
as
left
Pickle
no
room
to
doubt
of
his
capacity
.
    
<EOS>
While
they
stood
considering
the
pictures
in
one
of
the
first
apartments
,
which
are
by
no
means
the
most
masterly
compositions
,
the
Swiss
,
who
sets
up
for
a
connoisseur
,
looking
at
a
certain
piece
,
pronounced
the
word
magnifique
!
<EOS>
with
a
note
of
admiration
;
upon
which
Mr
Pallet
,
who
was
not
at
all
a
critick
in
the
French
language
,
replied
with
great
vivacity
,
"
Manufac
,
you
mean
,
and
a
very
indifferent
piece
of
manufacture
it
is
;
pray
gentleman
take
notice
,
there
is
no
keeping
in
those
heads
upon
the
back
ground
,
nor
no
relief
in
the
principal
figure
:
then
you
'll
observe
the
shadings
are
harsh
to
the
last
degree
;
and
come
a
little
closer
this
way
  
<EOS>
do
n't
you
perceive
that
the
fore
-
shortening
of
that
arm
is
monstrous
 
agad
,
sir
!
<EOS>
there
is
an
absolute
fracture
in
the
limb
 
doctor
,
you
understand
anatomy
,
do
n't
you
think
that
muscle
evidently
misplaced
?
<EOS>
Heark
ye
,
<EOS>
Mr
what
d'ye
call
um
,
(
turning
to
the
attendant
)
<EOS>
what
is
the
name
of
the
dauber
who
painted
that
miserable
performance
?
"
<EOS>
The
Swiss
imagining
that
he
was
all
this
time
expressing
his
satisfaction
,
sanctioned
his
supposed
commendation
,
by
exclaiming
sans
prix
.
<EOS>
"
Right
,
cried
Pallet
,
I
could
not
recollect
his
name
,
though
his
manner
is
quite
familiar
to
me
.
<EOS>
We
have
a
few
pieces
in
England
,
done
by
that
same
sangpree
;
but
there
they
are
in
no
estimation
;
we
have
more
taste
among
us
,
than
to
relish
the
productions
of
such
a
miserable
gout
.
<EOS>
Is
n't
he
an
ignorant
coxcomb
,
doctor
?
"
<EOS>
The
physician
ashamed
of
his
companion
's
blunder
,
thought
it
was
necessary
for
the
honour
of
his
own
character
,
to
take
notice
of
it
before
the
stranger
,
and
therefore
answered
his
question
,
by
repeating
this
line
from
Horace
,
Mutato
nomine
,
de
te
fabula
narratur
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
,
who
was
rather
more
ignorant
of
Latin
than
of
French
,
taking
it
for
granted
that
this
quotation
of
his
friend
,
conveyed
an
assent
to
his
opinion
,
"
Very
true
,
said
he
,
a
most
sensible
observation
!
<EOS>
mute
aye
toe
numbing
he
,
(
what
is't
?
)
<EOS>
Deity
,
fable
honour
hate
her
.
<EOS>
It
is
indeed
a
most
mute
benumbing
piece
;
and
the
fable
shews
that
the
painter
was
very
little
honoured
by
the
deity
.
"
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
astonished
at
this
surprising
perversion
of
the
words
and
meaning
of
a
Latin
line
,
which
,
at
first
,
he
could
not
help
thinking
was
a
premeditated
joke
;
but
upon
second
thoughts
,
he
saw
no
reason
to
doubt
that
it
was
the
extemporaneous
effect
of
sheer
pertness
and
ignorance
,
at
which
he
broke
out
into
an
immoderate
fit
of
laughter
.
<EOS>
Pallet
believing
that
the
gentleman
's
mirth
was
occasioned
by
his
arch
animadversion
upon
the
work
of
sangpree
,
underwent
the
same
emotion
in
a
much
louder
strain
,
and
endeavoured
to
heighten
the
jest
,
by
more
observations
of
the
same
nature
;
while
the
doctor
confounded
at
his
impudence
and
want
of
knowledge
,
reprimanded
him
in
these
words
of
Homer
,
Siga
,
mh
tiV
<EOS>
alloV
Axaiwn
,
touton
akoush
muqon
.
    
<EOS>
This
rebuke
,
the
reader
will
easily
perceive
,
was
not
calculated
for
the
meridian
of
his
friend
's
intellects
,
but
uttered
with
a
view
of
raising
his
own
character
in
the
opinion
of
Mr
Pickle
,
who
retorted
this
parade
of
learning
in
three
verses
from
the
same
author
,
being
part
of
the
speech
of
Polydamas
to
Hector
,
importing
that
it
is
impossible
for
one
man
to
excel
in
every
thing
.
    
<EOS>
The
self
-
sufficient
physician
,
who
did
not
expect
such
a
repartee
from
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
appearance
,
looked
upon
his
reply
as
a
fair
challenge
,
and
instantly
rehearsed
forty
or
fifty
lines
of
the
Iliad
in
a
breath
;
and
observing
that
the
stranger
made
no
effort
to
match
this
effusion
,
interpreted
his
silence
into
submission
;
then
,
in
order
to
ascertain
his
victory
,
insulted
him
with
divers
fragments
of
authors
,
whom
his
supposed
competitor
did
not
even
know
by
name
;
while
Mr
Pallet
stared
with
admiration
at
the
profound
scholarship
of
his
companion
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
far
from
repining
at
this
superiority
,
laughed
within
himself
at
the
ridiculous
ambition
of
the
pedantic
doctor
,
who
must
have
been
at
infinite
pains
in
conning
these
detached
pieces
,
with
a
view
of
retailing
them
in
company
for
the
credit
of
his
genius
and
knowledge
.
<EOS>
He
rated
him
in
his
own
mind
as
a
meer
index
-
hunter
,
who
held
the
eel
of
science
by
the
tail
,
and
foresaw
an
infinite
fund
of
diversion
in
his
solemnity
and
pride
,
if
properly
extracted
by
means
of
his
fellow
-
traveller
's
vanity
and
assurance
.
<EOS>
Prompted
by
these
considerations
,
he
resolved
to
cultivate
their
acquaintance
,
and
,
if
possible
,
amuse
himself
at
their
expence
in
his
journey
through
Flanders
,
understanding
that
they
were
determined
upon
the
same
route
.
<EOS>
In
this
view
he
treated
them
with
extraordinary
attention
,
and
seemed
to
pay
particular
deference
to
the
remarks
of
the
painter
,
who
with
great
intrepidity
pronounced
judgment
upon
every
picture
in
the
palace
,
or
in
other
words
,
exposed
his
own
nakedness
,
in
every
sentence
that
proceeded
from
his
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
When
they
came
to
consider
the
murder
of
the
innocents
by
Le
Brun
,
the
Swiss
observed
that
it
was
un
beau
moreau
,
and
Mr
Pallet
replied
,
"
Yes
,
yes
,
one
may
see
with
half
an
eye
,
that
it
can
be
the
production
of
no
other
;
for
Bomorsos
's
stile
,
both
in
colouring
and
drapery
,
is
altogether
peculiar
;
then
his
design
is
tame
,
and
his
expression
antic
and
unnatural
.
<EOS>
Doctor
,
you
have
seen
my
judgment
of
Solomon
,
I
think
I
may
without
presumption
 
<EOS>
but
,
I
do
n't
choose
to
make
comparisons
,
I
leave
that
odious
task
to
other
people
,
and
let
my
works
speak
for
themselves
.
<EOS>
France
,
to
be
sure
,
is
rich
in
the
arts
,
but
what
is
the
reason
?
<EOS>
the
king
encourages
men
of
genius
with
honour
and
rewards
:
whereas
,
in
England
,
we
are
obliged
to
stand
upon
our
own
feet
,
and
combat
the
envy
and
malice
of
our
brethren
;
agad
!
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
come
and
settle
here
in
Paris
;
I
should
like
to
have
an
apartment
in
the
Louvre
,
with
a
snug
pension
of
so
many
thousand
livres
.
<EOS>
"
In
this
manner
did
Pallet
proceed
with
an
eternal
rotation
of
tongue
,
floundering
from
one
mistake
to
another
,
until
it
was
the
turn
of
Poussin
's
seven
sacraments
to
be
examined
.
<EOS>
Here
again
the
Swiss
out
of
the
abundance
of
his
zeal
,
expressed
his
admiration
,
by
saying
,
these
pieces
were
impayable
;
when
the
painter
turning
to
him
with
an
air
of
exultation
,
"
Pardon
me
,
friend
,
there
you
happen
to
be
mistaken
,
these
are
none
of
impayable
's
,
but
done
by
Nicholas
Pouseen
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
prints
of
them
in
England
,
so
that
none
of
your
tricks
upon
travellers
,
Mr
Swish
or
Swash
,
or
what
's
your
name
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
elated
by
this
imaginary
triumph
of
his
understanding
,
which
animated
him
to
persevere
in
his
curious
observations
upon
all
the
other
pieces
of
that
celebrated
collection
;
but
perceiving
that
the
doctor
manifested
no
signs
of
pleasure
and
satisfaction
,
but
rather
beheld
them
with
a
silent
air
of
disdain
,
he
could
not
digest
his
indifference
,
and
asked
with
a
waggish
sneer
,
if
ever
he
had
seen
such
a
number
of
master
-
pieces
before
?
<EOS>
The
physician
eying
him
with
a
look
of
compassion
mingled
with
contempt
,
observed
that
there
was
nothing
there
which
deserved
the
attention
of
any
person
acquainted
with
the
ideas
of
the
ancients
;
and
that
the
author
of
the
finest
piece
now
in
being
,
was
unworthy
to
clean
the
brushes
of
one
of
those
great
masters
,
who
are
celebrated
by
the
Greek
and
Roman
writers
.
"

O

<EOS>
O

<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
painter
,
with
a
loud
laugh
)
<EOS>
you
have
fairly
brought
yourself
into
a
dilemma
at
last
,
dear
doctor
;
for
it
is
well
known
that
your
ancient
Greek
and
Roman
artists
knew
nothing
at
all
of
the
matter
,
in
comparison
with
our
modern
masters
;
for
this
good
reason
,
because
they
had
but
three
or
four
colours
,
and
knew
not
how
to
paint
with
oil
:
besides
,
which
of
all
your
old
fusty
Grecians
would
you
put
upon
a
footing
with
the
divine
Raphael
,
the
most
excellent
Michael

,
Bona
Roti

the
graceful
Guido

bewitching
Titian

all
others

He
would
have
proceeded
with
a
long
catalogue
of
names
which
he
had
got
by
heart
for
the
purpose
,
without
retaining
the
least
idea
of
their
several
qualifications
,
had
not
he
been
interrupted
by
his
friend
,
whose
indignation
being
kindled
by
the
irreverence
with
which
he
mentioned
the
Greeks
;
he
called
him
blasphemer
,
Goth
,
Baeotian
,
and
in
his
turn
,
asked
with
great
vehemence
,
which
of
those
puny
moderns
could
match
with
Panaenus
of
Athens
,
and
his
brother
Phidias
,
Polycletus
of
Sicyon
,
Polygnotus
the
Thrasian
,
Parrhasius
of
Ephesus
,
sirnamed
AbrodiaitoV
,
and
Apelles
the
prince
of
painters
?
<EOS>
He
challenged
him
to
shew
any
portrait
of
these
days
that
could
vye
with
the
Helen
of
Zeuxis
the
Heraclean
,
or
any
composition
equal
to
the
sacrifice
of
Iphigenia
,
by
Timanthes
the
Sicyonian
;
not
to
mention
the
twelve
gods
of
Asclepiadorus
the
Athenian
,
for
which
Mnason
,
tyrant
of
Elatea
,
gave
him
about
three
hundred
pounds
a
piece
,
or
Homer

by
Nicias
,
who
refused
sixty
talents
,
amounting
to
upwards
of
eleven
thousand
pounds
,
and
generously
made
a
present
of
it
to
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
He
desired
him
to
produce
a
collection
equal
to
that
in
the
temple
of
Delphos
,
mentioned
in
the
Iwn
of
Euripedes
;
where
Hercules
and

<EOS>
The
painter
was
astonished
and
confounded
at
this
rhapsody
of
names
and
instances
,
which
was
uttered
with
surprising
eagerness
and
rapidity
;
suspecting
at
first
that
the
whole
was
the
creation
of
his
own
brain
;
but
when
Pickle
,
with
a
view
of
flattering
the
doctor
's
self
-
conceit
,
espoused
his
side
of
the
question
,
and
confirmed
the
truth
of
every
thing
he
advanced
,
Mr
Pallet
changed
his
opinion
,
and
in
emphatic
silence
adored
the
immensity
of
his
friend
's
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
Peregrine
easily
perceived
that
they
were
false
enthusiasts
,
without
the
smallest
pretensions
to
taste
and
sensibility
;
and
pretended
to
be
in
raptures
with
<EOS>
they
knew
not
what
;
the
one
thinking
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
express
transports
on
seeing
the
works
of
those
who
had
been
most
eminent
in
his
profession
,
whether
they
did
or
did
not
really
raise
his
admiration
;
and
the
other
as
a
scholar
deeming
it
his
duty
to
magnify
the
ancients
above
all
competition
,
with
an
affected
fervour
,
which
the
knowledge
of
their
excellencies
never
inspired
.
<EOS>
Indeed
our
young
gentleman
so
successfully
accommodated
himself
to
the
disposition
of
each
,
that
long
before
their
review
was
finished
,
he
was
become
a
particular
favourite
with
both
.
    
<EOS>
From
the
Palais
Royal
he
accompanied
them
to
the
cloisters
of
the
Carthusians
,
where
they
considered
the
history
of
St
Bruno
,
by
Le
Sueur
,
whose
name
being
utterly
unknown
to
the
painter
,
he
gave
judgment
against
the
whole
composition
,
as
pitiful
and
paultry
;
though
in
the
opinion
of
all
good
judges
,
it
is
a
most
masterly
performance
.
    
<EOS>
Having
satisfied
their
curiosity
in
this
place
,
Peregrine
sollicited
them
to
favour
him
with
their
company
at
dinner
;
but
whether
out
of
caution
against
the
insinuations
of
one
whose
character
they
did
not
know
,
or
by
reason
of
a
prior
engagement
,
they
declined
his
invitation
on
pretence
of
having
an
appointment
at
a
certain
ordinary
,
though
they
expressed
a
desire
of
being
farther
acquainted
with
him
;
and
Mr
Pallet
took
the
freedom
of
asking
his
name
,
which
he
not
only
declared
,
but
promised
,
as
they
were
strangers
in
Paris
,
to
wait
upon
them
next
day
in
the
forenoon
,
in
order
to
conduct
them
to
the
hotel
de
Tholouse
,
and
the
houses
of
several
other
noblemen
,
remarkable
for
painting
or
curious
furniture
.
<EOS>
They
thankfully
embraced
his
proposal
,
and
that
same
day
made
inquiry
among
the
English
gentlemen
,
about
the
character
of
our
hero
,
which
they
found
so
much
to
their
satisfaction
,
that
upon
their
second
meeting
,
they
courted
his
good
graces
without
reserve
;
and
as
they
had
heard
of
his
intended
departure
,
begged
earnestly
to
have
the
honour
of
accompanying
him
through
the
Low
Countries
.
<EOS>
He
assured
them
that
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
to
him
,
than
the
prospect
of
having
such
fellow
-
travellers
;
and
they
immediately
appointed
a
day
for
setting
out
on
that
tour
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XLVII
<EOS>
He
introduces
his
new
friends
to
Mr
Jolter
,
with
whom
the
doctor
enters
into
a
dispute
upon
government
,
which
had
well
nigh
terminated
in
open
war
.
   
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
not
only
made
them
acquainted
with
every
thing
worth
seeing
in
town
,
but
attended
them
in
their
excursions
to
all
the
king
's
houses
within
a
day
's
journey
of
Paris
;
and
in
the
course
of
these
parties
,
treated
them
with
an
elegant
dinner
at
his
own
apartments
,
where
a
dispute
arose
between
the
doctor
and
Mr
Jolter
,
which
had
well
nigh
terminated
in
an
irreconcileable
animosity
.
    
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
,
with
an
equal
share
of
pride
,
pedantry
and
saturnine
disposition
,
were
by
the
accidents
of
education
and
company
,
diametrically
opposite
in
political
maxims
;
the
one
,
as
we
have
already
observed
,
being
a
bigotted
high
churchman
,
and
the
other
a
rank
republican
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
article
of
the
governor
's
creed
,
that
the
people
could
not
be
happy
,
nor
the
earth
yield
its
fruits
in
abundance
,
under
a
restricted
clergy
and
limited
government
:
whereas
,
in
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
it
was
an
eternal
truth
,
that
no
constitution
was
so
perfect
as
the
democracy
,
and
that
no
country
could
flourish
,
but
under
the
administration
of
the
mob
.
    
<EOS>
These
considerations
being
premised
,
no
wonder
that
they
happened
to
disagree
in
the
freedom
of
an
unreserved
conversation
,
especially
as
their
entertainer
took
all
opportunities
of
encouraging
and
inflaming
the
contention
.
<EOS>
The
first
source
of
their
difference
was
an
unlucky
remark
of
the
painter
,
who
observed
that
the
partridge
of
which
he
was
then
eating
,
had
the
finest
relish
of
any
he
had
ever
tasted
.
<EOS>
His
friend
owned
that
the
birds
were
the
best
of
the
kind
he
had
seen
in
France
;
but
affirmed
that
they
were
neither
so
plump
nor
delicious
as
those
that
were
caught
in
England
.
<EOS>
The
governor
considering
this
observation
as
the
effect
of
prejudice
and
inexperience
,
said
with
a
sarcastical
smile
,
"
I
believe
,
sir
,
you
are
very
well
disposed
to
find
every
thing
here
inferior
to
the
productions
of
your
own
country
.
"
<EOS>
"
True
,
sir
,
(
answered
the
physician
with
a
certain
solemnity
of
aspect
)
and
not
without
good
reason
I
hope
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
pray
,
(
resumed
the
tutor
)
why
may
not
the
partridges
of
France
be
as
good
as
those
of
England
?
"
<EOS>
"
For
a
very
plain
reason
,
replied
the
other
,
because
they
are
not
so
well
fed
.
<EOS>
The
iron
hand
of
oppression
is
extended
to
all
animals
within
the
French
dominions
,
even
to
the
beasts
of
the
field
and
the
fowls
of
the
air
.

<EOS>
"
Egad
!
cried
the
painter
,
that
is
a
truth
not
to
be
controverted
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
am
none
of
your
tit
-
bits
,
one
would
think
,
but
yet
there
's
a
freshness
in
the
English
complexion
,
a
ginseekeye
<EOS>
,
I
think
you
call
it
,
so
inviting
to
a
hungry
Frenchman
,
that
I
have
caught
several
in
the
very
act
of
viewing
me
with
an
eye
of
extreme
appetite
,
as
I
passed
;
and
as
for
their
curs
,
or
rather
their
wolves
,
(
for
by
jingo
they
are
more
liker
the
one
than
t'other
)
<EOS>
whenever
I
set
eyes
on
one
of
'em
,
<EOS>
Aha
!
<EOS>
your
humble
servant
<EOS>
Mr
son
of
a
bitch
,
I
am
upon
my
guard
in
an
instant
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
can
testify
that
their
very
horses
,
or
more
properly
their
live
carrion
that
drew
our
chaise
,
used
to
reach
back
their
long
necks
and
smell
at
us
,
as
a
couple
of
delicious
morsels
.
<EOS>
"
This
sally
of
Mr
Pallet
,
which
was
received
with
a
general
laugh
of
approbation
,
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
stifled
the
dispute
in
embrio
,
had
not
Mr
Jolter
with
a
self
-
applauding
simper
,
ironically
complimented
the
strangers
on
their
talking
like
true
Englishmen
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
affronted
at
the
insinuation
,
told
him
with
some
warmth
,
that
he
was
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
,
his
affections
and
ideas
being
confined
to
no
particular
country
;
for
he
considered
himself
as
a
citizen
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
He
owned
himself
more
attached
to
England
than
to
any
other
kingdom
,
but
this
preference
was
the
effect
of
reflexion
,
and
not
of
prejudice
;
because
the
British
constitution
approached
nearer
than
any
other
,
to
that
perfection
of
government
,
the
democracy
of
Athens
,
which
he
hoped
one
day
to
see
revived
:
he
mentioned
the
death
of
Charles
the
first
,
and
the
expulsion
of
his
son
,
with
raptures
of
applause
,
inveighed
with
great
acrimony
against
the
kingly
name
;
and
in
order
to
sanction
his
opinion
,
repeated
forty
or
fifty
lines
from
one
of
the
Philippicks
of
Demosthenes
.
<EOS>
Jolter
hearing
him
speak
so
disrespectfully
of
the
higher
powers
,
glowed
with
indignation
.
<EOS>
He
said
his
doctrines
were
detestable
and
destructive
of
all
right
,
order
and
society
;
that
monarchy
was
of
divine
institution
,
therefore
indefeasible
by
any
human
power
;
and
of
consequence
those
events
in
the
English
history
,
which
he
had
so
liberally
commended
,
were
no
other
than
flagrant
instances
of
sacrilege
,
perfidy
,
and
sedition
;
that
the
democracy
of
Athens
was
a
most
absurd
constitution
,
productive
of
anarchy
and
mischief
,
which
must
always
happen
when
the
government
of
a
nation
depends
upon
the
caprice
of
the
ignorant
hair
-
brained
vulgar
:
that
it
was
in
the
power
of
the
most
profligate
member
of
the
common
-
wealth
,
<EOS>
provided
he
was
endowed
with
eloquence
,
to
ruin
the
most
deserving
,
by
a
desperate
exertion
of
his
talents
upon
the
populace
,
who
had
been
often
persuaded
to
act
in
the
most
ungrateful
and
imprudent
manner
,
against
the
greatest
patriots
that
their
country
had
produced
:
and
finally
,
he
averred
,
that
the
liberal
arts
and
sciences
had
never
flourished
so
much
in
a
republick
,
as
under
the
encouragement
and
protection
of
absolute
power
;
witness
the
Augustan
age
,
and
the
reign
of
Lewis
the
fourteenth
:
nor
was
it
to
be
supposed
that
genius
and
merit
could
ever
be
so
amply
recompensed
by
the
individuals
,
or
distracted
councils
of
a
common
-
wealth
,
as
by
the
generosity
and
magnificence
of
one
,
who
had
the
whole
treasures
at
his
own
command
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
pleased
to
find
the
contest
grow
warm
,
observed
that
there
seemed
to
be
a
good
deal
of
truth
in
what
Mr
Jolter
advanced
;
and
the
painter
,
whose
opinion
began
to
waver
,
looked
with
a
face
of
expectation
at
his
friend
,
who
modelling
his
features
into
an
expression
of
exulting
disdain
,
asked
of
his
antagonist
,
if
he
did
not
think
that
very
power
of
rewarding
merit
,
enabled
an
absolute
prince
to
indulge
himself
in
the
most
arbitrary
licence
over
the
lives
and
fortunes
of
his
people
?
<EOS>
Before
the
governor
had
time
to
answer
this
question
,
Pallet
broke
forth
into
an
exclamation
of
"
By
the
Lord
!
<EOS>
that
is
certainly
fact
,
egad
!
<EOS>
that
was
a
home
thrust
,
doctor
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Mr
Jolter
chastising
this
shallow
intruder
with
a
contempt'ous
look
,
affirmed
that
though
supreme
power
furnished
a
good
prince
with
the
means
of
exerting
his
virtues
,
it
would
not
support
a
tyrant
in
the
exercise
of
cruelty
and
oppression
;
because
in
all
nations
,
the
genius
of
the
people
must
be
consulted
by
their
governors
,
and
the
burthen
proportioned
to
the
shoulders
on
which
it
is
laid
,
"
Else
,
what
follows
?
<EOS>
"
said
the
physician
,
"
The
consequence
is
plain
,
replied
the
governor
,
insurrection
,
revolt
,
and
his
own
destruction
:
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
subjects
of
any
nation
would
be
so
abject
and
pusilanimous
,
as
to
neglect
the
means
which
heaven
hath
put
in
their
power
for
their
own
preservation
.
"
<EOS>
"
Gadzooks
!
<EOS>
you
're
in
the
right
,
sir
,
cried
Pallet
,
<EOS>
that
I
grant
you
must
be
confessed
:
<EOS>
doctor
,
I
'm
afraid
we
have
got
into
the
wrong
box
.
<EOS>
"
This
son
of
Paean
,
however
,
far
from
being
of
his
friend
's
opinion
,
observed
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
that
he
would
not
only
demonstrate
the
sophistry
of
the
gentleman
's
last
allegation
,
by
argument
and
facts
,
but
even
confute
him
with
his
own
words
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
's
eyes
kindling
at
this
presumptuous
declaration
,
he
told
his
antagonist
,
while
his
lip
quivered
with
resentment
,
that
if
his
arguments
were
no
better
than
his
breeding
,
he
was
sure
he
would
make
very
few
converts
to
his
opinion
;
and
the
doctor
,
with
all
the
insolence
of
triumph
,
advised
him
to
beware
of
disputes
for
the
future
,
until
he
should
have
made
himself
more
master
of
his
subject
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
both
wished
and
hoped
to
see
the
disputants
proceed
to
arguments
of
more
weight
and
conviction
;
and
the
painter
dreading
the
same
issue
,
interposed
with
the
usual
exclamation
of
"
For
God
's
sake
,
gentlemen
!
"
<EOS>
when
the
governor
rose
from
table
in
great
dudgeon
,
and
left
the
room
,
muttering
some
ejaculation
,
of
which
the
word
coxcomb
only
could
be
distinctly
heard
.
<EOS>
The
physician
being
thus
left
master
of
the
field
of
battle
,
was
complimented
on
his
victory
by
Peregrine
,
and
so
elevated
by
his
success
,
that
he
declaimed
a
full
hour
on
the
absurdity
of
Jolter
's
proposition
,
and
the
beauty
of
the
democratic
administration
;
canvassed
the
whole
scheme
of
Plato
's
republic
,
with
many
quotations
from
that
ideal
author
;
touching
the
to
kalon
:
from
thence
he
made
a
transition
to
the
moral
sense
of
Shaftsbury
,
and
concluded
his
harangue
with
the
greatest
part
of
that
frothy
writer
's
rhapsody
,
which
he
repeated
with
all
the
violence
of
enthusiastic
agitation
;
to
the
unspeakable
satisfaction
of
his
entertainer
,
and
the
unutterable
admiration
of
Pallet
,
who
looked
upon
him
as
something
supernatural
and
divine
.
    
<EOS>
So
intoxicated
was
this
vain
young
man
with
the
ironical
praises
of
Pickle
,
that
he
forthwith
shook
off
all
reserve
,
and
having
professed
a
friendship
for
our
hero
,
whose
taste
and
learning
<EOS>
he
did
not
fail
to
extol
,
intimated
in
plain
terms
,
that
he
was
the
only
person
in
these
latter
ages
,
who
professed
that
sublime
genius
,
that
portion
of
the
divinity
or
ti
qeion
,
which
immortalized
the
Grecian
poets
;
that
as
Pythagoras
affirmed
the
spirit
of
Euphorbus
had
transmigrated
into
his
body
,
he
,
the
doctor
,
was
strangely
possessed
with
the
opinion
that
he
himself
was
inspired
by
the
soul
of
Pindar
;
because
,
making
allowance
for
the
difference
of
languages
,
in
which
they
wrote
,
there
was
a
surprising
affinity
between
his
own
works
and
those
of
that
celebrated
Theban
;
and
as
a
confirmation
of
this
truth
,
he
immediately
produced
a
sample
of
each
,
which
though
in
spirit
and
versification
,
as
different
as
the
Odes
of
Horace
and
our
present
laureat
,
Peregrine
did
not
scruple
to
pronounce
altogether
congenial
;
notwithstanding
the
violence
<EOS>
he
by
this
sentence
offered
to
his
own
conscience
,
and
a
certain
alarm
of
his
pride
,
that
was
weak
enough
to
be
disturbed
by
the
physician
's
ridiculous
vanity
and
presumption
,
which
not
contented
with
displaying
his
importance
in
the
world
of
taste
and
polite
literature
,
manifested
itself
in
arrogating
certain
material
discoveries
in
the
province
of
physick
,
which
could
not
fail
to
advance
him
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
that
profession
,
considering
the
recommendation
of
his
other
talents
,
together
with
a
liberal
fortune
which
he
inherited
from
his
father
.

Chapter
XLVIII
<EOS>
The
doctor
prepares
an
entertainment
in
the
manner
of
the
ancients
,
which
is
attended
with
divers
ridiculous
circumstances
.
   
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
our
young
gentleman
,
by
his
insinuating
behaviour
,
obtained
the
full
confidence
of
the
doctor
,
who
invited
him
to
an
entertainment
,
which
he
intended
to
prepare
in
the
manner
of
the
ancients
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
struck
with
this
idea
,
eagerly
embraced
the
proposal
,
which
he
honoured
with
many
encomiums
,
as
a
plan
in
all
respects
worthy
of
his
genius
and
apprehension
;
and
the
day
was
appointed
at
some
distance
of
time
,
that
the
treater
might
have
leisure
to
compose
certain
pickles
and
confections
which
were
not
to
be
found
among
the
culinary
preparations
of
these
degenerate
days
.
    
<EOS>
With
a
view
of
rendering
the
physician
's
taste
more
conspicuous
,
and
extracting
from
it
the
more
diversion
,
Peregrine
proposed
that
some
foreigners
should
partake
of
the
banquet
;
and
the
task
being
left
to
his
care
and
discretion
,
he
actually
bespoke
the
company
of
a
French
marquis
,
an
Italian
count
and
a
German
baron
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
egregious
coxcombs
,
and
therefore
more
likely
to
enhance
the
joy
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
hour
being
arrived
,
he
conducted
them
to
the
hotel
where
the
physician
lodged
,
after
having
regaled
their
expectations
with
an
elegant
meal
in
the
genuine
old
Roman
taste
;
and
they
were
received
by
Mr
Pallet
,
who
did
the
honours
of
the
house
,
while
his
friend
superintended
the
rotisseur
below
.
<EOS>
By
this
communicative
painter
,
the
guests
understood
that
the
doctor
had
met
with
numerous
difficulties
in
the
execution
of
his
design
;
that
no
fewer
than
five
cooks
had
been
dismissed
,
because
they
could
not
prevail
upon
their
own
consciences
to
obey
his
directions
in
things
that
were
contrary
to
the
present
practice
of
their
art
;
and
that
although
he
had
at
last
engaged
a
person
,
by
an
extraordinary
premium
,
to
comply
with
his
orders
,
the
fellow
was
so
astonished
,
mortified
and
incensed
at
the
commands
he
had
received
,
that
his
hair
stood
on
end
,
and
he
begged
on
his
knees
,
to
be
released
from
the
agreement
he
had
made
:
but
finding
that
his
employer
insisted
upon
the
performance
of
his
contract
,
and
threatened
to
introduce
him
to
the
commissaire
,
if
he
should
flinch
from
the
bargain
,
he
had
,
in
the
discharge
of
his
office
,
wept
,
sung
,
cursed
and
capered
for
two
whole
hours
without
intermission
;
so
that
his
brain
seemed
to
have
received
a
rude
shock
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
he
would
never
be
his
own
man
again
.
    
<EOS>
While
the
company
listened
to
this
odd
information
,
by
which
they
were
prepossessed
with
strange
notions
of
the
dinner
,
their
ears
were
invaded
by
a
piteous
voice
that
exclaimed
in
French
,
"
For
the
love
of
God
!
<EOS>
dear
Sir
!
<EOS>
for
the
passion
of
Jesus
Christ
!
<EOS>
spare
me
the
mortification
of
the
honey
and
oil
!
"
    
<EOS>
But
this
pathetic
supplication
having
no
effect
upon
the
physician
,
who
in
all
likelihood
poured
in
,
with
his
own
hand
,
the
sauce
against
which
the
cook
had
objected
,
the
same
voice
was
heard
to
utter
a
sort
of
yell
,
which
was
followed
by
a
string
of
execrations
in
the
French
language
,
that
gradually
died
away
,
as
if
the
swearer
had
been
forcibly
conveyed
into
a
more
distant
apartment
.
<EOS>
Their
ears
still
vibrated
with
the
sound
,
when
the
doctor
entering
,
was
by
Peregrine
made
acquainted
with
the
strangers
,
to
whom
he
,
in
the
transports
of
his
wrath
,
could
not
help
of
complaining
of
the
want
of
complaisance
he
had
found
in
the
Parisian
vulgar
,
by
which
his
plan
had
been
almost
entirely
ruined
and
set
aside
.
<EOS>
The
French
marquis
,
who
thought
the
honour
of
his
nation
was
concerned
at
this
declaration
,
professed
his
sorrow
for
what
had
happened
,
so
contrary
to
the
established
character
of
the
people
,
and
undertook
to
see
the
delinquents
severely
punished
,
provided
he
could
be
informed
of
their
names
or
places
of
abode
.
<EOS>
The
mutual
compliments
that
passed
on
this
occasion
were
scarce
finished
,
when
a
servant
coming
into
the
room
,
announced
dinner
;
and
the
entertainer
led
the
way
into
another
apartment
,
where
they
found
a
long
table
,
or
rather
two
boards
joined
together
,
and
furnished
with
a
variety
of
dishes
,
the
steams
of
which
had
such
evident
effect
upon
the
nerves
of
the
company
,
that
the
marquis
made
frightful
grimaces
,
under
pretence
of
taking
snuff
;
the
Italian
's
eyes
watered
,
the
German
's
visage
underwent
violent
distortion
of
features
;
our
hero
found
means
to
exclude
the
odour
from
his
sense
of
smelling
,
by
breathing
only
through
his
mouth
;
and
the
poor
painter
running
into
another
room
,
plugged
his
nostrils
with
tobacco
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
himself
,
who
was
the
only
person
then
present
whose
organs
were
not
discomposed
,
pointing
to
a
couple
of
couches
placed
on
each
side
of
the
table
,
told
his
guests
,
that
he
was
sorry
<EOS>
he
could
not
procure
the
exact
triclinia
of
the
ancients
,
which
were
somewhat
different
from
these
conveniencies
,
and
desired
they
would
have
the
goodness
to
repose
themselves
without
ceremony
,
each
in
his
respective
couchette
,
while
he
and
his
friend
Mr
Pallet
would
place
themselves
upright
at
the
ends
,
that
they
might
have
the
pleasure
of
serving
those
that
lay
along
.
<EOS>
This
disposition
,
of
which
the
strangers
had
no
previous
idea
,
disconcerted
and
perplexed
them
in
a
most
ridiculous
manner
;
the
marquis
and
baron
stood
bowing
to
each
other
,
on
pretence
of
disputing
the
lower
seat
,
but
in
reality
with
a
view
of
profiting
by
the
example
of
one
another
,
for
neither
of
them
understood
the
manner
in
which
they
were
to
loll
;
and
Peregrine
,
who
enjoyed
their
confusion
,
handed
the
count
to
the
other
side
,
where
,
with
the
most
mischievous
politeness
,
he
insisted
upon
his
taking
possession
of
the
upper
place
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
disagreeable
and
ludicrous
suspence
they
continued
acting
a
pantomime
of
gesticulations
,
until
the
doctor
earnestly
intreated
them
to
wave
all
compliment
and
form
,
lest
the
dinner
should
be
spoiled
before
the
ceremonial
could
be
adjusted
.
<EOS>
Thus
conjured
,
Peregrine
took
the
lower
couch
on
the
left
-
hand
side
,
laying
himself
gently
down
,
with
his
face
towards
the
table
.
<EOS>
The
marquis
,
in
imitation
of
this
pattern
(
though
he
would
have
much
rather
fasted
three
days
than
run
the
risk
of
discomposing
his
dress
by
such
an
attitude
)
stretched
himself
upon
the
opposite
place
,
reclining
upon
his
elbow
in
a
most
painful
and
aukward
situation
,
with
his
head
raised
above
the
end
of
the
couch
,
that
the
oeconomy
of
his
hair
might
not
suffer
by
the
projection
of
his
body
.
    
<EOS>
The
Italian
being
a
thin
,
limber
creature
,
planted
himself
next
to
Pickle
,
without
sustaining
any
misfortune
,
but
that
of
his
stocking
being
torn
by
a
ragged
nail
of
the
seat
,
as
he
raised
his
legs
on
a
level
with
the
rest
of
his
limbs
.
<EOS>
But
the
baron
,
who
was
neither
so
wieldy
nor
supple
in
his
joints
as
his
companions
,
flounced
himself
down
with
such
precipitation
,
that
his
feet
suddenly
tilting
up
,
came
in
furious
contact
with
the
head
of
the
marquis
,
and
demolished
every
curl
in
a
twinkling
,
while
his
own
skull
,
at
the
same
instant
,
descended
upon
the
side
of
his
couch
with
such
violence
,
that
his
periwig
was
struck
off
,
and
the
whole
room
filled
with
pulvilio
.
    
<EOS>
The
drollery
of
distress
that
attended
this
disaster
entirely
vanquished
the
affected
gravity
of
our
young
gentleman
,
who
was
obliged
to
suppress
his
laughter
by
cramming
his
handkerchief
in
his
mouth
;
for
the
bare
-
headed
German
asked
pardon
with
such
ridiculous
confusion
,
and
the
marquis
admitted
his
apology
with
such
rueful
complaisance
,
as
were
sufficient
to
awake
the
mirth
of
a
quietist
,
whose
insensibility
was
not
utterly
extinguished
.
    
<EOS>
This
misfortune
being
repaired
as
well
as
the
circumstances
of
the
occasion
would
permit
,
and
every
one
settled
according
to
the
arrangement
already
described
,
the
doctor
graciously
undertook
to
give
some
account
of
the
dishes
as
they
occurred
,
that
the
company
might
be
directed
in
their
choice
;
and
with
an
air
of
infinite
satisfaction
thus
began
:
    
"
This
here
,
gentlemen
,
is
a
boiled
goose
,
served
up
in
a
sauce
composed
of
pepper
,
lovage
,
coriander
,
mint
,
rue
,
anchovies
and
oil
;
I
wish
for
your
sakes
,
gentlemen
,
it
was
one
of
the
geese
of
Ferrara
,
so
much
celebrated
among
the
ancients
for
the
magnitude
of
their
livers
,
one
of
which
is
said
to
have
weighed
upwards
of
two
pounds
:
with
this
food
,
exquisite
as
it
was
,
did
the
tyrant
Heliogabalus
regale
his
hounds
.
<EOS>
But
I
beg
pardon
,
I
had
almost
forgot
the
soup
,
which
I
hear
is
so
necessary
an
article
at
all
tables
in
France
.
<EOS>
At
each
end
there
are
dishes
of
the
salacacabia
of
the
Romans
,
one
is
made
of
parsley
,
pennyroyal
,
cheese
,
pine
-
tops
,
honey
,
vinegar
,
brine
,
eggs
,
cucumbers
,
onions
and
hen
livers
;
the
other
is
much
the
same
as
the
soup
-
maigre
of
this
country
.
<EOS>
Then
there
is
a
loin
of
veal
boiled
with
fennel
and
caraway
-
seed
,
on
a
pottage
composed
of
pickle
,
oil
,
honey
and
flour
,
and
a
curious
hachis
of
the
lights
,
liver
and
blood
of
an
hare
,
together
with
a
dish
of
roasted
pigeons
.
<EOS>
Monsieur
le
baron
,
shall
I
help
you
to
a
plate
of
this
soup
?
"
<EOS>
The
German
,
who
did
not
at
all
disapprove
of
the
ingredients
,
assented
to
the
proposal
,
and
seemed
to
relish
the
composition
;
while
the
marquis
,
being
asked
by
the
painter
which
of
the
silly
-
kickabys
he
chose
,
was
in
consequence
of
his
desire
accommodated
with
a
portion
of
the
soup
maigre
;
and
the
count
,
in
lieu
of
spoon
-
meat
,
of
which
he
said
he
was
no
great
admirer
,
supplied
himself
with
a
pigeon
,
therein
conforming
to
the
choice
of
our
young
gentleman
,
whose
example
he
determined
to
follow
through
the
whole
course
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
The
Frenchman
having
swallowed
the
first
spoonful
,
made
a
full
pause
<EOS>
,
his
throat
swelled
,
as
if
an
egg
had
stuck
in
his
gullet
,
his
eyes
rolled
,
and
his
mouth
underwent
a
series
of
involuntary
contractions
and
dilatations
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
,
who
looked
stedfastly
at
this
connoisseur
,
with
a
view
of
consulting
his
taste
,
before
he
himself
would
venture
upon
the
soup
,
began
to
be
disturbed
at
these
emotions
,
and
observed
with
some
concern
,
that
the
poor
gentleman
seemed
to
be
going
into
a
fit
;
when
Peregrine
assured
him
that
these
were
symptoms
of
extasy
,
and
for
further
confirmation
,
asked
the
marquis
how
he
found
the
soup
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
infinite
difficulty
that
his
complaisance
could
so
far
master
his
disgust
,
as
to
enable
him
to
answer
,
"
Altogether
excellent
,
upon
my
honour
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
painter
being
certified
of
his
approbation
,
lifted
the
spoon
to
his
mouth
without
scruple
;
but
,
far
from
justifying
the
elogium
of
his
taster
,
when
this
precious
composition
diffused
itself
upon
his
palate
,
he
seemed
to
be
deprived
of
all
sense
and
motion
,
and
sat
like
the
leaden
statue
of
some
river
god
,
with
the
liquor
flowing
out
at
both
sides
of
his
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
alarmed
at
this
indecent
phaenomenon
,
earnestly
inquired
into
the
cause
of
it
;
and
when
Pallet
recovered
his
recollection
,
and
swore
that
he
would
rather
swallow
porridge
made
of
burning
brimstone
,
than
such
an
infernal
mess
as
that
which
he
had
tasted
,
the
physician
,
in
his
own
vindication
,
assured
the
company
,
that
,
except
the
usual
ingredients
,
he
had
mixed
nothing
in
the
soup
but
some
sal
armoniac
instead
of
the
ancient
nitrum
,
which
could
not
now
be
procured
;
and
appealed
to
the
marquis
,
whether
such
a
succedaneum
was
not
an
improvement
on
the
whole
.
    
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
petit
maitre
,
driven
to
the
extremity
of
his
condescension
,
acknowledged
it
to
be
a
masterly
refinement
;
and
deeming
himself
obliged
,
in
point
of
honour
,
to
evince
his
sentiments
by
his
practice
,
forced
a
few
more
mouthfuls
of
this
disagreeable
potion
down
his
throat
,
till
his
stomach
was
so
much
offended
,
that
he
was
compelled
to
start
up
of
a
sudden
,
and
in
the
hurry
of
his
elevation
overturned
his
plate
into
the
bosom
of
the
baron
.
<EOS>
The
emergency
of
his
occasions
would
not
permit
him
to
stay
and
make
apologies
for
this
abrupt
behaviour
,
so
that
he
flew
into
another
apartment
,
where
Pickle
found
him
puking
,
and
crossing
himself
with
great
devotion
;
and
a
chair
,
at
his
desire
,
being
brought
to
the
door
,
he
slipt
into
it
more
dead
than
alive
,
conjuring
his
friend
Pickle
to
make
his
peace
with
the
company
,
and
in
particular
excuse
him
to
the
baron
,
on
account
of
the
violent
fit
of
illness
with
which
he
had
been
seized
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
without
reason
that
he
employed
a
mediator
;
for
when
our
hero
returned
to
the
dining
-
room
,
the
German
got
up
,
and
was
under
the
hands
of
his
own
lacquey
,
who
wiped
the
grease
from
a
rich
embroidered
waistcoat
,
while
he
,
almost
frantic
with
his
misfortune
,
stamped
upon
the
ground
,
and
in
High
Dutch
cursed
the
unlucky
banquet
,
and
the
impertinent
entertainer
,
who
all
this
time
,
with
great
deliberation
,
consoled
him
for
the
disaster
,
by
assuring
him
,
that
the
damage
might
be
repaired
with
some
oil
of
turpentine
and
an
hot
iron
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
could
scarce
refrain
from
laughing
in
his
face
,
appeased
his
indignation
,
by
telling
him
how
much
the
whole
company
,
and
especially
the
marquis
,
was
mortified
at
the
accident
;
and
the
unhappy
salacacabia
being
removed
,
the
places
were
filled
with
two
pies
,
one
of
dormice
liquored
with
syrup
of
white
poppies
,
which
the
doctor
had
substituted
in
the
room
of
toasted
poppy
-
seed
,
formerly
eaten
with
honey
,
as
a
desert
;
and
the
other
composed
of
an
hock
of
pork
baked
in
honey
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
hearing
the
first
of
these
dishes
described
,
lifted
up
his
hands
and
eyes
,
and
with
signs
of
loathing
and
amazement
pronounced
,
"
A
pye
made
of
dormice
and
syrup
of
poppies
;
Christ
in
heaven
!
<EOS>
what
beastly
fellows
these
Romans
were
!
"
<EOS>
His
friend
checked
him
for
his
irreverent
exclamation
with
a
severe
look
,
and
recommended
the
veal
,
of
which
he
himself
chearfully
ate
,
with
such
encomiums
to
the
company
,
that
the
baron
resolved
to
imitate
his
example
,
after
having
called
for
a
bumper
of
Burgundy
,
which
the
physician
,
for
his
sake
,
wished
to
have
been
the
true
wine
of
Falernum
.
<EOS>
The
painter
seeing
nothing
else
upon
the
table
which
he
would
venture
to
touch
,
made
a
merit
of
necessity
,
and
had
recourse
to
the
veal
also
;
although
he
could
not
help
saying
,
that
he
would
not
give
one
slice
of
the
roast
beef
of
old
England
for
all
the
dainties
of
a
Roman
emperor
's
table
.
<EOS>
But
all
the
doctor
's
invitations
and
assurances
could
not
prevail
upon
his
guests
to
honour
the
hachis
and
the
goose
;
and
that
course
was
succeeded
by
another
,
in
which
he
told
them
were
divers
of
those
dishes
,
which
among
the
antients
had
obtained
the
appellation
of
politeles
,
or
magnificent
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
That
which
smoaks
in
the
middle
(
said
he
)
is
a
sow
's
stomach
,
filled
with
a
composition
of
minced
pork
,
hog
's
brains
,
eggs
,
pepper
,
cloves
,
garlick
,
anniseed
,
rue
,
ginger
,
oil
,
wine
and
pickle
.
<EOS>
On
the
right
hand
side
are
the
teats
and
belly
of
a
sow
,
just
farrowed
,
fried
with
sweet
wine
,
oil
,
flour
,
lovage
and
pepper
.
<EOS>
On
the
left
is
a
fricassee
of
snails
,
fed
,
or
rather
purged
with
milk
.
    
<EOS>
At
that
end
next
Mr
Pallet
are
fritters
of
pompions
,
lovage
,
origanum
and
oil
;
and
here
are
a
couple
of
pullets
,
roasted
and
stuffed
in
the
manner
of
Apicius
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
,
who
had
by
wry
faces
,
testify'd
his
abhorrence
of
the
sow
's
stomach
,
which
he
compared
to
a
bagpipe
,
and
the
snails
which
had
undergone
purgation
,
no
sooner
heard
him
mention
the
roasted
pullets
,
than
he
eagerly
sollicited
a
wing
of
the
fowl
;
upon
which
the
doctor
desired
he
would
take
the
trouble
of
cutting
them
up
,
and
accordingly
sent
them
round
,
while
Mr
Pallet
tucked
the
table

cloth
under
his
chin
,
and
brandished
his
knife
and
fork
with
singular
address
:
but
scarce
were
they
set
down
before
him
,
when
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
and
he
called
aloud
,
in
manifest
disorder
,
"
Z####ds
<EOS>
!
<EOS>
this
is
the
essence
of
a
whole
bed
of
garlic
!
"
<EOS>
That
he
might
not
,
however
,
disappoint
or
disgrace
the
entertainer
,
he
applied
his
instruments
to
one
of
the
birds
,
and
when
he
opened
up
the
cavity
,
was
assaulted
by
such
an
irruption
of
intolerable
smells
,
that
without
staying
to
disengage
himself
from
the
cloth
,
he
sprung
away
,
with
an
exclamation
of
,
"
Lord
Jesus
!
"
<EOS>
and
involved
the
whole
table
in
havock
,
ruin
and
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
Before
Pickle
could
accomplish
his
escape
,
he
was
sauced
with
the
syrup
of
the
dormouse
pye
,
which
went
to
pieces
in
the
general
wreck
;
and
as
for
the
Italian
count
,
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
sow
's
stomach
,
which
bursting
in
the
fall
,
discharged
its
contents
upon
his
leg
and
thigh
,
and
scalded
him
so
miserably
,
that
he
shrieked
with
anguish
,
and
grinned
with
a
most
ghastly
and
horrible
aspect
.
    
<EOS>
The
baron
,
who
sat
secure
without
the
vortex
of
this
tumult
,
was
not
at
all
displeased
at
seeing
his
companions
involved
in
such
a
calamity
as
that
which
he
had
already
shared
;
but
the
doctor
was
confounded
with
shame
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
After
having
prescribed
an
application
of
oil
to
the
count
's
leg
,
he
expressed
his
sorrow
for
the
misadventure
,
which
he
openly
ascribed
to
want
of
taste
and
prudence
in
the
painter
,
who
did
not
think
proper
to
return
,
and
make
an
apology
in
person
;
and
protested
,
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
fowls
which
could
give
offence
to
a
sensible
nose
,
the
stuffing
being
a
mixture
of
pepper
,
lovage
and
assa
foetida
,
and
the
sauce
consisting
of
wine
and
herring
-
pickle
,
which
he
had
used
instead
of
the
celebrated
garum
of
the
Romans
;
that
famous
pickle
having
been
prepared
sometimes
of
the
scombri
,
which
were
a
sort
of
tunny
fish
,
and
sometimes
of
the
silurus
,
or
shad
-
fish
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
observed
that
there
was
a
third
kind
,
called
garum
haemation
,
made
of
the
guts
,
gills
and
blood
of
the
thynnus
.
    
<EOS>
The
physician
,
finding
it
would
be
impracticable
to
re
-
establish
the
order
of
the
banquet
,
by
presenting
again
the
dishes
which
had
been
discomposed
,
ordered
every
thing
to
be
removed
,
a
clean
cloth
to
be
laid
,
and
the
desert
to
be
brought
in
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
regretted
his
incapacity
to
give
them
a
specimen
of
the
alieus
,
or
fish
meals
of
the
ancients
,
such
as
the
jus
diabaton
,
the
conger
-
eel
,
which
in
Galen
's
opinion
is
hard
of
digestion
,
the
cornuta
,
or
gurnard
,
described
by
Pliny
in
his
Natural
History
,
who
says
,
the
horns
of
many
of
them
were
a
foot
and
a
half
in
length
;
the
mullet
and
lamprey
,
that
were
in
the
highest
estimation
of
old
,
of
which
last
Julius
Caesar
borrowed
six
thousand
for
one
triumphal
supper
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
the
manner
of
dressing
them
was
described
by
Horace
,
in
the
account
he
gives
of
the
entertainment
to
which
Maecenas
was
invited
by
the
epicure
<EOS>
Nasiedenus
:
<EOS>
Affertur
squillas
inter
Murena
natantes
,
&
c.
    
<EOS>
And
told
them
,
that
they
were
commonly
eaten
with
the
rhus
syriacum
,
a
certain
anodyne
and
astringent
seed
,
which
qualified
the
purgative
nature
of
the
fish
.
<EOS>
Finally
,
this
learned
physician
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
though
this
was
reckoned
a
luxurious
dish
in
the
zenith
of
the
Roman
taste
,
it
was
by
no
means
comparable
,
in
point
of
expence
,
to
some
preparations
in
vogue
about
the
time
of
that
absurd
voluptuary
Heliogabalus
,
who
ordered
the
brains
of
six
hundred
ostriches
to
be
compounded
in
one
mess
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
the
desert
appeared
,
and
the
company
were
not
a
little
rejoiced
to
see
plain
olives
in
salt
and
water
:
but
what
the
master
of
the
feast
valued
himself
upon
,
was
a
sort
of
jelly
,
which
he
affirmed
to
be
preferable
to
the
hypotrimma
of
Hesychius
,
being
a
mixture
of
vinegar
,
pickle
and
honey
,
boiled
to
a
proper
consistence
,
and
candied
assa
foetida
,
which
he
asserted
,
in
contradiction
to
Humelbergius
and
Lister
,
was
no
other
than
the
laser
syriacum
,
so
precious
,
as
to
be
sold
among
the
ancients
to
the
weight
of
a
silver
penny
.
    
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
took
his
word
for
the
excellency
of
this
gum
,
but
contented
themselves
with
the
olives
,
which
gave
such
an
agreeable
relish
to
the
wine
,
that
they
seemed
very
well
disposed
to
console
themselves
for
the
disgraces
they
had
endured
;
and
Pickle
,
unwilling
to
lose
the
least
circumstance
of
entertainment
that
could
be
enjoyed
in
their
company
,
went
in
quest
of
the
painter
,
who
remained
in
his
penitentials
in
another
apartment
,
and
could
not
be
persuaded
to
re
-
enter
the
banqueting
-
room
,
until
Peregrine
undertook
to
procure
his
pardon
from
those
whom
he
had
injured
.
<EOS>
Having
assured
him
of
this
indulgence
,
our
young
gentleman
led
him
in
like
a
criminal
,
bowing
on
all
hands
with
an
air
of
humility
and
contrition
;
and
particularly
addressing
himself
to
the
count
,
to
whom
he
swore
in
English
,
as
God
was
his
saviour
,
he
had
no
intent
to
affront
man
,
woman
,
or
child
;
but
was
fain
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
,
that
he
might
not
give
the
honourable
company
cause
of
offence
,
by
obeying
the
dictates
of
nature
in
their
presence
.
    
<EOS>
When
Pickle
interpreted
this
apology
to
the
Italian
,
Pallet
was
forgiven
in
very
polite
terms
,
and
even
received
into
favour
by
his
friend
the
doctor
,
in
consequence
of
our
hero
's
intercession
:
so
that
all
the
guests
forgot
their
chagrin
,
and
paid
their
respects
so
piously
to
the
bottle
,
that
in
a
short
time
the
Champaigne
produced
very
evident
effects
in
the
behaviour
of
all
present

Chapter
XLIX
<EOS>
The
Italian
marquis
and
German
baron
are
disgraced
;
the
painter
is
persuaded
to
accompany
Pickle
to
a
masquerade
in
woman
's
apparel
;
is
engaged
in
a
troublesome
adventure
,
and
with
his
companion
conveyed
to
the
Bastile
.
   
<EOS>
The
painter
,
at
the
request
of
Pickle
,
who
had
a
design
upon
the
count
's
sense
of
hearing
,
favoured
the
company
with
the
song
of
Bumper
Squire
Jones
,
which
yielded
infinite
satisfaction
to
the
baron
;
but
affected
the
delicate
ears
of
the
Italian
in
such
a
manner
,
that
his
features
expressed
astonishment
and
disquiet
;
and
by
his
sudden
and
repeated
journeys
to
the
door
,
it
plainly
appeared
,
that
he
was
in
the
same
predicament
with
those
who
,
as
Shakespear
observes
,
when
the
bagpipe
sings
in
the
nose
,
can
not
contain
their
urine
for
affection
.
    
<EOS>
With
a
view
,
therefore
,
of
vindicating
music
from
such
a
barbarous
taste
,
Mr
Pallet
had
no
sooner
performed
his
task
,
than
the
count
honoured
his
friends
with
some
favourite
airs
of
his
own
country
,
which
he
warbled
with
infinite
grace
and
expression
,
though
they
had
not
energy
sufficient
to
engage
the
attention
of
the
German
,
who
fell
fast
asleep
upon
his
couch
,
and
snored
so
loud
,
as
to
interrupt
,
and
totally
annul
this
ravishing
entertainment
;
so
that
they
were
fain
to
have
recourse
again
to
the
glass
,
which
made
such
innovation
upon
the
brain
of
the
physician
,
that
he
sung
divers
odes
of
Anacreon
to
a
tune
of
his
own
composing
,
and
held
forth
upon
the
music
and
recitative
of
the
ancients
with
great
erudition
;
while
Pallet
,
having
found
means
to
make
the
Italian
acquainted
with
the
nature
of
his
profession
,
harangued
upon
painting
with
wonderful
volubility
,
in
a
language
which
(
it
was
well
for
his
own
credit
)
<EOS>
the
stranger
did
not
understand
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
the
doctor
was
seized
with
such
a
qualm
,
that
he
begged
Peregrine
to
lead
him
to
his
chamber
;
and
the
count
,
tired
with
the
eternal
babble
of
the
painter
,
reeled
towards
the
sleeping
baron
,
whom
he
viewed
with
rapture
,
repeating
from
the
Il
Pastor
Fido
of
Guarini
,
Come
assetato
infermo
Che
bram
lungamente
<EOS>
Il
vietato

<EOS>

E

<EOS>
Then
boldly
ravished
a
kiss
,
and
began
to
tickle
him
under
the
ribs
,
with
such
expressions
of
tenderness
,
as
scandalized
the
virtuous
painter
,
who
,
conscious
of
his
own
attractions
,
was
alarmed
for
his
person
,
and
staggered
in
great
hurry
and
discomposure
into
the
next
room
,
where
he
put
himself
under
the
protection
of
our
hero
,
to
whom
he
imparted
his
suspicion
of
the
count
's
morals
,
by
describing
the
indecency
of
his
deportment
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
entertained
a
just
detestation
for
all
such
abominable
practices
,
was
incensed
at
this
information
;
and
stepping
to
the
door
of
the
dining
-
room
where
the
two
strangers
were
left
together
,
saw
with
his
own
eyes
enough
to
convince
him
,
that
Pallet
's
complaint
was
not
without
foundation
,
and
that
the
baron
was
not
averse
to
the
addresses
of
the
count
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
's
indignation
had
well
nigh
prompted
him
to
rush
in
,
and
take
immediate
vengeance
on
the
offenders
;
but
,
considering
that
such
a
precipitate
step
might
be
attended
with
troublesome
consequences
to
himself
,
he
resisted
the
impulse
of
his
wrath
,
and
tasked
his
invention
with
some
method
of
inflicting
upon
them
a
disgrace
suited
to
the
grossness
of
their
ideas
.
<EOS>
After
having
revolved
sundry
schemes
of
punishment
,
and
even
consulted
Mr
Pipes
,
who
being
present
at
the
discovery
,
undertook
to
sew
them
up
in
bags
,
with
a
reasonable
quantity
of
ballast
in
each
,
and
throw
them
over
the
Pont
Neuf
into
the
river
;
his
imagination
could
not
supply
him
with
an
expedient
to
his
liking
,
and
he
was
at
a
loss
how
to
behave
,
when
the
landlady
of
the
house
,
whom
he
knew
to
be
a
dame
of
remarkable
vivacity
,
chancing
to
pass
,
furnished
him
with
a
hint
,
of
which
he
immediately
took
the
advantage
,
by
begging
she
would
do
him
the
favour
to
step
into
the
next
room
,
and
tell
the
gentlemen
,
that
he
would
be
with
them
as
soon
as
the
doctor
could
be
put
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
The
lady
very
graciously
undertook
the
office
,
and
entering
the
apartment
,
was
so
much
offended
and
enraged
at
the
mutual
endearments
of
the
two
lovers
,
that
instead
of
delivering
the
message
with
which
she
had
been
entrusted
,
she
set
the
trumpet
of
reproach
to
her
mouth
,
and
seizing
the
baron
's
cane
,
which
she
found
upon
the
side
-
table
,
belaboured
them
both
with
such
eagerness
of
animosity
,
that
they
found
themselves
obliged
to
make
a
very
disorderly
retreat
,
and
were
actually
driven
down
stairs
,
in
a
most
disgraceful
condition
,
by
this
exasperated
virago
,
who
loaded
them
with
just
invectives
all
the
way
,
publishing
their
shame
,
not
only
to
those
of
her
own
family
,
but
likewise
to
the
populace
,
who
began
to
crowd
about
the
door
,
and
in
all
probability
would
have
espoused
her
revenge
,
had
not
their
lacqueys
,
who
were
in
waiting
,
conveyed
the
delinquents
into
the
Remise
,
and
carried
them
off
with
great
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
so
delighted
with
the
manner
of
the
chastisement
they
had
undergone
,
that
he
embraced
the
mistress
of
the
hotel
with
transport
,
for
the
spirit
she
had
exerted
;
and
being
rendered
frolicksome
with
the
wine
he
had
drank
,
proposed
that
he
and
Pallet
should
go
to
a
masquerade
,
which
he
recollected
<EOS>
was
to
be
given
that
night
.
<EOS>
The
painter
did
not
want
curiosity
and
inclination
to
accompany
him
,
but
expressed
his
apprehension
of
losing
him
in
the
ball
;
an
accident
which
could
not
fail
to
be
very
disagreeable
,
as
he
was
an
utter
stranger
to
the
language
and
the
town
.
<EOS>
To
obviate
this
objection
,
the
landlady
,
who
was
of
their
council
,
advised
him
to
appear
in
a
woman
's
dress
,
which
would
lay
his
companion
under
the
necessity
of
attending
him
with
more
care
,
as
he
could
not
with
decency
detach
himself
from
the
lady
whom
he
should
introduce
:
<EOS>
besides
,
such
a
supposed
connexion
would
hinder
the
ladies
of
pleasure
from
accosting
,
and
employing
their
seducing
arts
upon
a
person
already
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
foreseeing
abundance
of
diversion
in
the
execution
of
this
project
,
seconded
the
proposal
with
such
importunity
and
address
,
that
the
painter
allowed
himself
to
be
habited
in
a
suit
belonging
to
the
landlady
,
who
also
procured
for
him
a
mask
and
domino
,
while
Pickle
provided
himself
with
a
Spanish
dress
.
<EOS>
In
this
disguise
,
which
they
put
on
about
eleven
o'clock
,
did
they
,
attended
by
Pipes
,
set
out
in
a
Fiacre
for
the
ball
-
room
,
into
which
Pickle
led
this
supposititious
female
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
whole
company
,
who
had
never
seen
such
an
uncouth
figure
in
the
appearance
of
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
After
they
had
taken
a
view
of
all
the
remarkable
masques
,
and
the
painter
had
been
treated
with
a
glass
of
liqueur
,
his
mischievous
companion
gave
him
the
slip
,
and
vanishing
in
an
instant
,
returned
with
another
mask
and
a
domino
over
his
habit
,
that
he
might
enjoy
Pallet
's
perplexity
,
and
be
at
hand
to
protect
him
from
insult
.
    
<EOS>
The
poor
painter
having
lost
his
guide
,
was
almost
distracted
with
anxiety
,
and
stalked
about
the
room
,
in
quest
of
him
,
with
such
huge
strides
and
oddity
of
gesture
,
that
he
was
followed
by
a
whole
multitude
,
who
gazed
at
him
as
a
preternatural
phaenomenon
.
<EOS>
This
attendance
increased
his
uneasiness
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
not
help
uttering
a
soliloquy
aloud
,
in
which
he
cursed
his
fate
for
having
depended
upon
the
promise
of
such
a
wag
;
and
swore
,
that
if
once
he
was
clear
of
this
scrape
,
he
would
not
bring
himself
into
such
a
premunire
again
for
the
whole
kingdom
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
Divers
petit
maitres
understanding
the
masque
was
a
foreigner
,
who
in
all
probability
could
not
speak
French
,
made
up
to
him
in
their
turns
,
in
order
to
display
their
wit
and
address
,
and
teized
him
with
several
arch
questions
;
to
which
he
made
no
other
answer
than
,
"
No
parly
Francy
.
<EOS>
Damn
your
chattering
!
<EOS>
Go
about
your
business
,
ca
n't
ye
?
"
    
<EOS>
But
,
what
most
of
all
contributed
to
his
torture
and
mortification
,
was
a
pressing
call
from
nature
,
in
consequence
of
the
Champaign
he
had
so
liberally
swallowed
in
the
afternoon
.
<EOS>
In
the
character
of
a
woman
,
he
neither
knew
whither
to
retire
,
nor
,
had
he
known
,
durst
he
run
the
risk
of
being
discovered
,
in
such
a
situation
,
by
the
individuals
of
that
sex
;
and
if
he
should
use
the
privilege
of
a
man
,
in
his
present
appearance
,
he
foresaw
that
he
must
subject
himself
to
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
company
;
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
suffer
the
most
racking
pangs
of
retention
,
and
coursed
round
and
round
the
whole
place
,
casting
many
a
woeful
look
among
the
crowd
in
search
of
Pickle
,
against
whom
he
uttered
innumerable
execrations
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
was
compelled
to
yield
to
the
urgent
dictates
of
necessity
,
and
following
several
gentlemen
into
a
small
adjoining
room
furnished
for
the
occasion
,
discharged
the
source
of
his
vexation
in
presence
of
them
all
,
crying
in
his
own
excuse
,
"
By
your
leave
,
by
your
leave
.
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
necessity
has
no
law
.
<EOS>
"
The
circumstances
of
this
operation
were
so
extraordinary
and
ridiculous
,
that
some
of
those
who
were
witnesses
of
it
,
held
up
their
hands
in
token
of
amazement
;
while
others
ran
into
the
ballroom
,
and
called
their
companions
to
see
such
an
unheard
-
of
spectacle
.
    
<EOS>
Among
the
masques
that
,
upon
this
intimation
,
came
to
see
the
painter
's
attitude
,
was
a
person
of
great
quality
,
who
being
a
little
acquainted
with
the
English
language
,
waited
till
Pallet
turned
about
;
and
going
up
to
him
,
"
<EOS>
Madam
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
give
you
joy
of
your
happy

<EOS>
It

"
    
<EOS>
"
Yes
,
thank
God
,
Monsieur
,
(
replied
the
painter
)
<EOS>
I
never
was
troubled
with
the
stone
.
"
<EOS>
"
Oho

<EOS>
(
resumed
the
masque
)
<EOS>
so

<EOS>
You

"
<EOS>
"
Gadzooks
!
<EOS>
my
dear
,
you
have
nicked
it
to
an
hair
!
<EOS>
That
is
the
very
case
,
as
I
hope
to
be
saved
,
"
cried
Pallet
,
bursting
into
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
;
which
divesting
the
Frenchman
of
all
ceremony
and
reserve
,
he
began
to
be
very
free
with
the
supposed
lady
,
and
attempted
to
plunge
his
hand
into
her
bosom
:
but
the
painter
was
too
modest
to
suffer
such
indecent
treatment
;
and
when
the
gallant
repeated
his
efforts
in
a
manner
still
more
indelicate
,
lent
him
such
a
box
on
the
ear
,
as
made
the
lights
dance
before
him
,
and
created
such
a
suspicion
of
Pallet
's
sex
,
that
the
nobleman
swore
he
was
either
a
male
or
hermaphrodite
,
and
insisted
upon
a
scrutiny
,
for
the
sake
of
his
own
honour
,
with
such
obstinacy
of
resentment
,
that
the
fictitious
nymph
was
in
imminent
danger
,
not
only
of
being
exposed
,
but
also
of
undergoing
severe
chastisement
,
for
having
made
so
free
with
the
prince
's
ear
;
when
Peregrine
,
who
saw
and
over
-
heard
every
thing
that
passed
,
thought
it
was
high
time
to
interpose
;
and
accordingly
,
asserted
his
pretensions
to
the
insulted
lady
,
who
was
overjoyed
at
this
proof
of
his
protection
.
    
<EOS>
The
affronted
gallant
persevered
in
demanding
to
know
who
she
was
,
and
our
hero
as
strenuously
refused
to
give
him
that
satisfaction
:
so
that
high
words
ensued
;
and
the
prince
threatening
to
punish
his
insolence
,
the
young
gentleman
,
who
was
not
supposed
to
know
his
quality
,
pointed
to
the
place
where
his
own
sword
used
to
hang
,
and
snapping
his
fingers
in
his
face
,
laid
hold
on
the
painter
's
arm
,
and
led
him
to
another
part
of
the
room
,
leaving
his
antagonist
to
the
meditations
of
his
own
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
having
chid
his
conductor
for
his
barbarous
desertion
,
made
him
acquainted
with
the
difficulty
in
which
he
had
been
involved
,
and
flatly
telling
him
,
he
would
not
put
it
in
his
power
to
give
him
the
slip
again
,
held
fast
by
his
arm
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
entertainment
,
to
the
no
small
diversion
of
the
company
,
whose
attention
was
altogether
engrossed
in
the
contemplation
of
such
an
aukward
,
ungainly
stalking
apparition
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
Pickle
being
tired
of
exhibiting
this
rareeshew
,
complied
with
the
repeated
desires
of
his
companion
,
and
handed
her
into
the
coach
;
which
he
himself
had
no
sooner
entered
,
than
they
were
surrounded
by
a
file
of
musqueteers
,
commanded
by
an
exempt
,
who
ordering
the
coach
-
door
to
be
opened
,
took
his
place
with
great
deliberation
,
while
one
of
his
detachment
mounted
the
box
,
in
order
to
direct
the
driver
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
at
once
conceived
the
meaning
of
this
arrest
,
and
it
was
well
for
him
that
he
had
no
weapon
wherewith
to
stand
upon
his
defence
;
for
such
was
the
impetuosity
and
rashness
of
his
temper
,
that
had
he
been
armed
,
he
would
have
run
all
risks
rather
than
surrender
himself
to
any
odds
whatever
;
but
Pallet
imagining
that
the
officer
was
some
gentleman
who
had
mistaken
their
carriage
for
his
own
,
desired
his
friend
to
undeceive
the
stranger
;
and
when
he
was
informed
of
the
real
state
of
their
condition
,
his
knees
began
to
shake
,
his
teeth
to
chatter
,
and
he
uttered
a
most
doleful
lamentation
,
importing
his
fear
of
being
carried
to
some
hideous
dungeon
of
the
Bastile
,
where
he
should
spend
the
rest
of
his
days
in
misery
and
horror
,
and
never
see
the
light
of
God
's
sun
,
nor
the
face
of
a
friend
;
but
perish
in
a
foreign
land
,
far
removed
from
his
family
and
connexions
.
<EOS>
Pickle
damned
him
for
his
pusilanimity
,
and
the
Exempt
hearing
a
lady
bemoan
herself
so
piteously
,
expressed
his
mortification
at
being
the
instrument
of
giving
her
such
pain
,
and
endeavoured
to
console
them
,
by
representing
the
lenity
of
the
French
government
,
and
the
singular
generosity
of
the
prince
,
by
whose
order
they
were
apprehended
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
whose
discretion
seemed
to
forsake
him
on
all
such
occasions
,
exclaimed
with
great
bitterness
against
the
arbitrary
administration
of
France
,
and
inveighed
with
many
expressions
of
contempt
,
against
the
character
of
the
offended
prince
,
whose
resentment
,
far
from
being
noble
,
he
said
,
was
pitiful
,
ungenerous
and
unjust
.
<EOS>
To
this
remonstrance
the
officer
made
no
reply
,
but
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
in
silent
astonishment
at
the
hardiesse
of
the
prisoner
,
and
the
Fiacre
was
just
on
the
point
of
setting
out
,
when
they
heard
the
noise
of
a
scuffle
at
the
back
of
the
coach
,
and
the
voice
of
Tom
Pipes
,
pronouncing
"
I
'll
be
damn'd
if
I
do
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
trusty
attendant
had
been
desired
by
one
of
the
guard
to
descend
from
his
station
in
the
rear
,
but
as
he
resolved
to
share
his
master
's
fate
,
he
took
no
notice
of
their
intreaties
,
until
they
were
seconded
by
force
;
and
that
he
endeavoured
to
repel
with
his
heel
,
which
he
applied
with
such
energy
to
the
jaws
of
the
soldier
who
first
came
in
contact
with
him
,
that
they
emitted
a
crashing
sound
like
a
dried
walnut
between
the
grinders
of
a
templar
in
the
pit
.
    
<EOS>
Exasperated
at
this
outrage
,
the
other
saluted
Tom
's
posteriors
with
his
bayonet
,
which
incommoded
him
so
much
,
that
he
could
no
longer
keep
his
post
,
but
leaping
upon
the
ground
,
gave
his
antagonist
a
chuck
under
the
chin
,
that
laid
him
upon
his
back
,
and
then
skipping
over
him
with
infinite
agility
,
absconded
among
the
crowd
of
coaches
,
till
he
saw
the
guard
mount
before
and
behind
upon
his
master
's
Fiacre
,
which
no
sooner
set
forward
than
he
followed
at
a
small
distance
,
to
reconnoitre
the
place
where
Peregrine
should
be
confined
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
proceeded
slowly
through
many
windings
and
turnings
to
a
part
of
Paris
,
in
which
Pipes
was
an
utter
stranger
,
the
coach
stopped
at
a
great
gate
,
with
a
wicket
in
the
middle
,
which
being
opened
at
the
approach
of
the
carriage
,
the
prisoners
were
admitted
,
and
<EOS>
the
guard
returning
with
the
Fiacre
,
Tom
determined
to
watch
in
that
place
all
night
,
that
in
the
morning
he
might
make
such
observations
,
as
might
be
conducive
to
the
enlargement
of
his
master
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
L
   
<EOS>
This
plan
he
executed
notwithstanding
the
pain
of
his
wound
,
and
the
questions
of
the
city
guard
both
horse
and
foot
,
to
which
he
could
make
no
other
answer
than
"
Anglois
,
Anglois
;
"
and
as
soon
as
it
was
light
,
taking
an
accurate
survey
of
the
castle
(
for
such
it
seemed
to
be
)
into
which
Peregrine
and
Pallet
had
been
conveyed
,
together
with
its
situation
in
respect
to
the
river
,
he
went
home
to
the
lodgings
,
and
waking
Mr
Jolter
,
gave
him
an
account
of
the
adventure
.
<EOS>
The
governor
wrung
his
hands
in
the
utmost
grief
and
consternation
,
when
he
heard
this
unfortunate
piece
of
news
;
he
did
not
doubt
that
his
pupil
was
imprisoned
in
the
Bastile
for
life
;
and
in
the
anguish
of
his
apprehension
,
cursed
the
day
on
which
he
had
undertaken
to
superintend
the
conduct
of
such
an
imprudent
young
man
,
who
had
by
reiterated
insults
provoked
the
vengeance
of
such
a
mild
forbearing
administration
.
<EOS>
That
he
might
not
,
however
,
neglect
any
means
in
his
power
to
extricate
him
from
his
present
misfortune
,
he
dispatched
Thomas
to
the
doctor
,
with
an
account
of
his
companion
's
fate
,
that
they
might
join
their
interest
in
behalf
of
the
captives
;
and
the
physician
being
informed
of
what
had
happened
,
immediately
dressed
himself
and
repaired
to
Jolter
,
whom
he
accosted
in
these
words
:
"
<EOS>
Now
,
sir
,
I
hope
you
are
convinced
of
your
error
,
in
asserting
that
oppression
can
never
be
the
effect
of
arbitrary
power
.
<EOS>
Such
a
calamity
as
this
could
never
have
happened
under
the
Athenian
democracy
:
<EOS>
nay
,
even
when
the
tyrant
Pisistratus
got
possession
of
that
commonwealth
<EOS>
,
he
durst
not
venture
to
rule
with
such
absolute
and
unjust
dominion
.
    
<EOS>
You
shall
see
now
that
Mr
Pickle
and
my
friend
Pallet
will
fall
a
sacrifice
to
the
tyrancy
of
lawless
power
;
and
in
my
opinion
,
we
shall
be
accessory
to
the
ruin
of
this
poor
enslaved
people
,
if
we
bestir
ourselves
in
demanding
,
or
imploring
the
release
of
our
unhappy
countrymen
;
as
we
may
thereby
prevent
the
commission
of
a
flagrant
crime
,
which
would
fill
up
the
vengeance
of
heaven
against
the
perpetrators
,
and
perhaps
be
the
means
of
restoring
a
whole
nation
to
the
unspeakable
fruition
of
freedom
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
should
rejoice
to
see
the
blood
of
my
father
spilt
in
such
a
glorious
cause
,
provided
such
a
victim
would
furnish
me
with
the
opportunity
of
dissolving
the
chains
of
slavery
,
and
vindicating
that
liberty
which
is
the
birth
-
right
of
man
.
<EOS>
Then
would
my
name
be
immortalized
among
the
patriot
heroes
of
antiquity
,
and
my
memory
like
that
of
Harmodius
and
Aristogiton
,
be
honoured
by
statues
erected
at
the
public
expense
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
rhapsody
,
which
was
delivered
with
great
emphasis
and
agitation
,
gave
so
much
offence
to
Jolter
,
that
without
speaking
one
word
,
he
retired
in
great
wrath
to
his
own
chamber
,
and
the
republican
returned
to
his
lodging
,
in
full
hope
of
his
prognostic
being
verified
in
the
death
and
destruction
of
Peregrine
and
the
painter
,
which
must
give
rise
to
some
renowned
revolution
,
wherein
he
himself
would
act
a
principal
part
.
<EOS>
But
the
governor
,
whose
imagination
was
not
quite
so
warm
and
prolifick
,
went
directly
to
the
Embassador
,
whom
he
informed
of
his
pupil
's
situation
,
and
besought
to
interpose
with
the
French
ministry
,
that
he
and
the
other
British
subject
might
obtain
their
liberty
.
    
<EOS>
His
excellency
asked
if
Jolter
could
guess
at
the
cause
of
his
imprisonment
,
that
he
might
be
the
better
prepared
to
vindicate
or
excuse
his
conduct
;
but
neither
he
nor
Pipes
could
give
the
smallest
hint
of
intelligence
on
that
subject
;
though
he
furnished
himself
from
Tom
's
own
mouth
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
manner
in
which
his
master
had
been
arrested
,
as
well
as
of
his
own
behaviour
,
and
the
disaster
he
had
received
on
that
occasion
.
<EOS>
His
Lordship
never
doubted
that
Pickle
had
brought
this
calamity
upon
himself
by
some
unlucky
prank
he
had
played
at
the
masquerade
;
especially
when
he
understood
that
the
young
gentleman
had
drank
freely
in
the
afternoon
,
and
been
so
whimsical
as
to
go
thither
with
a
man
in
woman
's
apparel
;
and
he
that
same
day
waited
on
the
French
minister
,
in
full
confidence
of
obtaining
his
discharge
;
but
met
with
more
difficulty
than
he
expected
,
the
court
of
France
being
extremely
punctilious
in
every
thing
that
concerns
a
prince
of
the
blood
:
the
ambassador
was
,
therefore
,
obliged
to
talk
in
very
high
terms
,
and
though
the
present
circumstances
of
the
French
politicks
would
not
allow
them
to
fall
out
with
the
British
administration
for
trifles
,
all
the
favour
he
could
procure
,
was
a
promise
that
Pickle
should
be
set
at
liberty
,
provided
he
would
ask
pardon
of
the
prince
to
whom
he
had
given
offence
.
<EOS>
His
excellency
thought
this
was
but
a
reasonable
condescension
,
supposing
Peregrine
to
have
been
in
the
wrong
;
and
Jolter
was
admitted
to
him
,
in
order
to
communicate
and
reinforce
his
Lordship
's
advice
,
which
was
that
he
should
comply
with
the
terms
proposed
.
<EOS>
The
governor
,
who
did
not
enter
this
gloomy
fortress
without
fear
and
trembling
,
found
his
pupil
in
a
dismal
apartment
void
of
all
furniture
,
but
a
stool
and
truckle
-
bed
;
the
moment
he
was
admitted
,
he
perceived
the
youth
whistling
with
great
unconcern
,
and
working
with
his
pencil
at
the
bare
wall
,
on
which
he
had
delineated
a
ludicrous
figure
labelled
with
the
name
of
the
nobleman
whom
he
had
affronted
,
and
an
English
mastiff
with
his
leg
lifted
up
,
in
the
attitude
of
making
water
in
his
shoe
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
been
even
so
presumptuous
as
to
explain
the
device
with
satirical
inscriptions
in
the
French
language
,
which
when
Jolter
perused
,
his
hair
stood
on
end
with
affright
.
<EOS>
The
very
turnkey
was
confounded
and
overawed
by
the
boldness
of
his
behaviour
,
which
he
had
never
seen
matched
by
any
inhabitant
of
that
place
;
and
actually
joined
his
friend
in
persuading
him
to
submit
to
the
easy
demand
of
the
minister
.
<EOS>
But
our
hero
,
far
from
embracing
the
counsel
of
this
advocate
,
handed
him
to
the
door
with
great
ceremony
,
and
dismissed
him
with
a
kick
on
the
breech
;
and
to
all
the
supplications
,
and
even
tears
of
Jolter
,
made
no
other
reply
,
than
that
he
would
stoop
to
no
condescension
,
because
he
had
committed
no
crime
;
but
would
leave
his
case
to
the
cognizance
and
exertion
of
the
British
court
,
whose
duty
it
was
to
see
justice
done
to
its
own
subjects
:
he
desired
,
however
,
that
Pallet
,
who
was
confined
in
another
place
,
might
avail
himself
of
his
own
disposition
,
which
was
sufficiently
plyable
.
<EOS>
But
when
the
governor
desired
to
see
his
fellow
-
prisoner
,
the
turnkey
gave
him
to
understand
that
he
had
received
no
orders
relating
to
the
lady
,
and
therefore
could
not
admit
him
into
her
apartment
;
though
he
was
complaisant
enough
to
tell
him
,
that
she
seemed
very
much
mortified
at
her
confinement
,
and
at
certain
times
behaved
as
if
her
brain
was
not
a
little
disordered
.
<EOS>
Jolter
thus
baffled
in
all
his
endeavours
,
quitted
the
Bastile
with
a
heavy
heart
,
and
reported
his
fruitless
negociation
to
the
Embassador
,
who
could
not
help
breaking
forth
into
some
acrimonious
expressions
against
the
obstinacy
and
insolence
of
the
young
man
,
who
,
he
said
,
deserved
to
suffer
for
his
folly
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
desist
from
his
representations
to
the
French
ministry
,
which
he
found
so
unyielding
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
threaten
in
plain
terms
,
to
make
it
a
national
concern
;
and
not
only
write
to
his
court
for
instructions
,
but
even
advise
the
council
to
make
reprisals
,
and
send
some
French
gentleman
in
London
to
the
Tower
.
    
<EOS>
This
intimation
had
an
effect
upon
the
ministry
at
Versailles
,
who
rather
than
run
the
risk
of
incensing
a
people
whom
it
was
neither
their
interest
nor
inclination
to
disoblige
,
consented
to
discharge
the
offenders
,
on
condition
that
they
should
leave
Paris
in
three
days
after
their
enlargement
.
<EOS>
This
proposal
was
readily
agreed
to
by
Peregrine
,
who
was
now
a
little
more
tractable
,
and
heartily
tired
of
being
cooped
up
in
such
an
uncomfortable
abode
,
for
the
space
of
three
long
days
,
without
any
sort
of
communication
or
entertainment
,
but
that
which
his
own
imagination
suggested
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LI
Peregrine
makes
himself
merry
at
the
expence
of
the
painter
,
who
curses
his
landlady
,
and
breaks
with
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
As
he
could
easily
conceive
the
situation
of
his
companion
in
adversity
,
he
was
unwilling
to
leave
the
place
,
until
he
had
reaped
some
diversion
from
his
distress
,
and
with
that
view
repaired
to
the
dungeon
of
the
afflicted
painter
,
to
which
he
had
by
this
time
free
access
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
entered
,
the
first
object
that
presented
itself
to
his
eye
,
was
so
uncommonly
ridiculous
,
that
he
could
scarce
preserve
that
gravity
of
countenance
which
he
had
affected
in
order
to
execute
the
joke
he
had
planned
.
<EOS>
The
forlorn
Pallet
sat
upright
in
his
bed
in
a
dishabille
that
was
altogether
extraordinary
.
<EOS>
He
had
laid
aside
his
monstrous
hoop
,
together
with
his
stays
,
gown
and
petticoat
,
wrapped
his
lappets
about
his
head
by
way
of
night
-
cap
,
and
wore
his
domino
as
a
loose
morning
dress
;
his
grizzled
locks
hung
down
about
his
lack
-
lustre
eyes
and
tawny
neck
,
in
all
the
disorder
of
negligence
;
his
grey
beard
bristled
about
half
an
inch
,
through
the
remains
of
the
paint
with
which
his
visage
had
been
bedaubed
,
and
every
feature
of
his
face
was
lengthened
to
the
most
ridiculous
expression
of
grief
and
dismay
.
<EOS>
Seeing
Peregrine
come
in
,
he
started
up
in
a
sort
of
frantic
extasy
,
and
running
towards
him
with
open
arms
,
no
sooner
perceived
the
woeful
appearance
into
which
our
hero
had
modelled
his
physiognomy
,
than
he
stopped
short
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
the
joy
which
had
begun
to
take
possession
of
his
heart
,
was
in
a
moment
dispelled
by
the
most
rueful
presages
;
so
that
he
stood
in
a
most
ludicrous
posture
of
dejection
,
like
a
malefactor
at
the
Old
Baily
,
when
sentence
is
about
to
be
pronounced
.
<EOS>
Pickle
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
heaved
a
profound
sigh
,
and
after
having
protested
that
he
was
extremely
mortified
at
being
pitched
upon
as
the
messenger
of
bad
news
,
told
him
with
an
air
of
sympathy
and
infinite
concern
,
that
the
French
court
having
discovered
his
sex
,
had
resolved
,
in
consideration
of
the
outrageous
indignity
he
offered
in
public
to
a
prince
of
the
blood
,
to
detain
him
in
the
Bastile
a
prisoner
for
life
;
and
that
this
sentence
was
a
mitigation
obtained
by
the
importunities
of
the
British
Embassador
;
the
punishment
ordained
by
law
being
no
other
than
breaking
alive
upon
the
wheel
.
    
<EOS>
These
tidings
aggravated
the
horrors
of
the
painter
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
roared
aloud
,
and
skipped
about
the
room
,
in
all
the
extravagance
of
distraction
;
taking
God
and
man
to
witness
that
he
would
rather
suffer
immediate
death
,
than
endure
one
year
's
imprisonment
in
such
a
hideous
place
;
and
cursing
the
hour
of
his
birth
,
and
the
moment
on
which
he
departed
from
his
own
country
.
<EOS>
"
For
my
own
part
,
(
said
his
tormenter
in
an
hypocritical
tone
)
<EOS>
I
was
obliged
to
swallow
the
bitter
pill
of
making
submissions
to
the
prince
,
who
,
as
I
had
not
presumed
to
strike
him
,
received
acknowledgments
,
in
consequence
of
which
I
shall
be
this
day
set
at
liberty
;
and
there
is
even
one
expedient
left
for
the
recovery
of
your
freedom
.
<EOS>
It
is
,
I
own
,
a
disagreeable
remedy
,
but
one
had
better
undergo
a
little
mortification
,
than
be
for
ever
wretched
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
upon
second
thoughts
,
I
begin
to
imagine
that
you
will
not
for
such
a
trifle
sacrifice
yourself
to
the
unceasing
horrors
of
a
solitary
dungeon
;
especially
as
your
condescension
will
in
all
probability
be
attended
with
advantages
which
you
could
not
otherwise
enjoy
.
"
<EOS>
Pallet
interrupting
him
with
great
eagerness
,
begged
for
the
love
of
God
that
he
would
no
longer
keep
him
in
the
torture
of
suspence
,
but
mention
that
same
remedy
,
which
he
was
resolved
to
swallow
,
<EOS>
let
it
be
never
so
unpalatable
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
thus
played
upon
his
passions
of
fear
and
hope
,
answered
,
that
as
the
offence
was
committed
in
the
habit
of
a
woman
,
which
was
a
disguise
unworthy
of
the
other
sex
;
the
French
court
was
of
opinion
that
the
delinquent
should
for
ever
forfeit
the
privileges
and
characteristic
of
a
man
,
which
he
had
so
shamefully
deposited
,
or
in
other
words
,
be
deprived
of
his
virility
;
so
that
there
was
an
alternative
at
his
own
option
,
by
which
he
had
it
in
his
power
to
regain
immediate
freedom
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
cried
the
painter
in
despair
,
part
with
my
manhood
,
and
become
a
singer
?
<EOS>
Gadzooks
!
<EOS>
and
the
devil
and
all
that
,
I
'll
rather
lie
still
where
I
am
,
and
let
myself
be
devoured
by
vermin
.
"
<EOS>
Then
thrusting
out
his
throat
,
"
Here
is
my
wind
-
pipe
,
(
said
he
)
be
so
good
,
<EOS>
my
dear
friend
,
as
to
give
it
a
slice
or
two
;
if
you
do
n't
,
I
shall
<EOS>
one
of
these
days
be
found
dangling
in
my
garters
.
<EOS>
What
an
unfortunate
rascal
I
am
!
<EOS>
What
a
blockhead
,
and
a
beast
,
and
a
fool
was
I
to
trust
myself
among
such
a
barbarous
ruffian
race
!
<EOS>
Lord
forgive
you
,
Mr
Pickle
,
for
having
been
the
immediate
cause
of
my
disaster
;
if
you
had
stood
by
me
from
the
beginning
,
according
to
your
promise
,
and
directed
me
to
a
proper
place
,
where
I
could
have
made
water
without
being
exposed
,
I
should
not
have
been
teized
by
that
coxcomb
who
has
brought
me
to
this
pass
.
<EOS>
And
why
did
I
put
on
this
damn'd
unlucky
dress
?
<EOS>
Lard
curse
that
chattering
Jezabel
of
a
landlady
,
who
advised
such
a
preposterous
disguise
!
<EOS>
a
disguise
<EOS>
which
hath
not
only
brought
me
to
this
pass
,
but
also
rendered
me
abominable
to
myself
,
and
frightful
to
others
;
for
,
when
I
this
morning
signified
to
the
turnkey
,
that
I
wanted
to
be
shaved
,
he
looked
at
my
beard
with
astonishment
,
and
crossing
himself
,
muttered
his
pater
-
noster
,
believing
me
(
I
suppose
)
to
be
a
witch
,
or
something
worse
.
<EOS>
And
heaven
confound
that
loathsome
banquet
of
the
ancients
,
which
provoked
me
to
drink
too
freely
,
that
I
might
wash
away
the
taste
of
that
accursed
sillikicaby
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
having
heard
his
lamentation
to
an
end
,
excused
himself
for
his
conduct
,
by
representing
,
that
he
could
not
possibly
foresee
the
disagreeable
consequences
that
attended
it
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
strenuously
counselled
him
to
submit
to
the
terms
of
his
enlargement
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
he
was
now
arrived
at
that
time
of
life
,
when
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
should
be
entirely
mortified
within
him
,
and
his
greatest
concern
ought
to
be
the
health
of
his
soul
,
to
which
nothing
could
more
effectually
contribute
than
the
amputation
which
was
proposed
:
that
his
body
,
as
well
as
his
mind
,
would
profit
by
the
change
,
because
he
would
have
no
dangerous
appetite
to
gratify
,
and
no
carnal
thoughts
to
divert
him
from
the
duties
of
his
profession
;
and
his
voice
,
which
was
naturally
sweet
,
would
improve
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
would
captivate
the
ears
of
all
the
people
of
fashion
and
taste
,
and
in
a
little
time
be
celebrated
under
the
appellation
of
the
English
Senesino
.
    
<EOS>
These
arguments
did
not
fail
to
make
impression
upon
the
painter
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
started
three
objections
to
his
compliance
;
namely
,
the
disgrace
of
the
punishment
,
the
pain
of
the
operation
,
and
the
dread
of
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
undertook
to
obviate
these
difficulties
,
by
assuring
him
,
that
the
sentence
would
be
executed
so
privately
,
as
never
to
transpire
;
that
the
excision
(
as
he
had
learnt
from
Motecelli
)
was
not
so
painful
as
the
drawing
of
a
tooth
,
and
that
his
wife
could
not
be
so
unconscionable
,
after
so
many
years
of
cohabitation
,
as
to
take
exceptions
to
an
expedient
,
by
which
she
would
not
only
enjoy
the
conversation
of
her
husband
,
but
even
the
fruits
of
those
talents
which
the
knife
would
so
remarkably
refine
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
shook
his
head
at
this
last
remonstrance
,
as
if
he
thought
it
would
not
be
altogether
convincing
to
his
spouse
;
but
yielded
to
the
proposal
,
provided
her
consent
could
be
obtained
.
<EOS>
Just
as
he
signified
this
condescension
,
the
goaler
entered
,
and
addressing
himself
to
the
supposed
lady
,
expressed
his
satisfaction
in
having
the
honour
to
tell
her
,
that
she
was
no
longer
a
prisoner
.
<EOS>
As
the
painter
did
not
understand
one
word
of
what
he
said
,
Peregrine
undertook
the
office
of
interpreter
,
and
made
his
friend
believe
,
the
goaler
's
speech
was
no
other
than
an
intimation
,
that
the
ministry
had
sent
a
surgeon
to
execute
what
was
proposed
,
and
that
the
instruments
and
dressings
were
prepared
in
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
Alarmed
and
terrified
at
this
sudden
appointment
,
he
flew
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
snatching
up
an
earthen
chamber
-
pot
,
which
was
the
only
offensive
weapon
in
the
place
,
put
himself
in
a
posture
of
defiance
,
and
with
many
oaths
threatened
to
try
the
temper
of
the
barber
's
skull
,
if
he
should
presume
to
set
his
nose
within
the
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
The
goaler
,
who
little
expected
such
a
reception
,
concluded
that
the
poor
gentlewoman
had
actually
lost
her
wits
,
and
retreated
with
precipitation
,
leaving
the
door
open
as
he
went
out
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
Pickle
,
gathering
up
the
particulars
of
his
dress
with
great
dispatch
,
crammed
them
into
Pallet
's
arms
,
and
taking
notice
that
now
the
coast
was
clear
,
exhorted
him
to
follow
his
footsteps
to
the
gate
,
where
a
hackney
-
coach
flood
for
his
reception
.
    
<EOS>
There
being
no
time
for
hesitation
,
the
painter
took
his
advice
,
and
without
quitting
the
utensil
,
which
in
his
hurry
he
forgot
to
lay
down
,
sallied
out
in
the
rear
of
our
hero
,
with
all
that
wildness
of
terror
and
impatience
which
may
be
reasonably
supposed
to
take
possession
of
a
man
who
flies
from
castration
or
perpetual
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
tumult
of
his
agitation
,
that
his
faculty
of
thinking
was
for
the
present
utterly
overwhelmed
,
and
he
saw
no
object
but
his
conductor
,
whom
he
followed
by
a
sort
of
instinctive
impulse
,
without
regarding
the
keepers
and
centinels
,
who
,
as
he
passed
with
his
cloaths
under
one
arm
,
and
his
chamber
-
pot
brandished
above
his
head
,
were
confounded
,
and
even
dismayed
at
the
strange
apparition
.
    
<EOS>
During
the
whole
course
of
this
irruption
,
he
ceased
not
to
cry
with
great
vociferation
,
"
Drive
,
coachman
,
drive
in
the
name
of
God
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
carriage
had
proceeded
the
length
of
a
whole
street
,
before
he
manifested
the
least
sign
of
reflection
,
but
stared
like
the
Gorgon
's
head
,
with
his
mouth
wide
open
,
and
each
particular
hair
crawling
and
twining
like
an
animated
serpent
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
began
to
recover
the
use
of
his
senses
,
and
asked
if
Peregrine
thought
him
now
out
of
all
danger
of
being
retaken
.
<EOS>
This
unrelenting
wag
,
not
yet
satisfied
with
the
affliction
he
had
imposed
upon
the
sufferer
,
answered
with
an
air
of
doubt
and
concern
,
that
he
hoped
they
would
not
be
overtaken
,
and
prayed
to
God
they
might
not
be
retarded
by
an
Embaras
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
fervently
joined
in
this
supplication
,
and
they
advanced
a
few
yards
further
,
when
the
noise
of
a
coach
at
full
speed
behind
them
,
invaded
their
ears
;
and
Pickle
having
looked
out
at
the
window
,
withdrew
his
head
in
seeming
confusion
,
and
exclaimed
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
I
wish
that
may
not
be
a
guard
sent
after
us
.
<EOS>
Methinks
<EOS>
I
saw
the
muzzle
of
a
fusil
sticking
out
of
the
coach
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
painter
hearing
these
tidings
,
that
instant
thrust
himself
half
out
at
the
window
,
with
his
helmet
still
in
his
hand
,
bellowing
to
the
coachman
as
loud
as
he
could
roar
,
"
Drive
,
damn
ye
drive
!
<EOS>
to
the
gates
of
Jericho
and
ends
of
the
earth
!
<EOS>
Drive
,
you
raggamuffin
,
<EOS>
you
rapscallion
,
you
hell
-
hound
!
<EOS>
drive
us
to
the
pit
of
hell
,
rather
than
we
should
be
taken
,
and
lose
the
treasures
of
virility
.
"
    
<EOS>
Such
a
phantom
could
not
pass
,
without
attracting
the
curiosity
of
the
people
,
who
ran
to
their
doors
and
windows
,
in
order
to
behold
this
object
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
With
the
same
view
that
coach
,
which
was
supposed
to
be
in
pursuit
of
him
,
stopt
just
as
the
windows
of
each
happened
to
be
opposite
;
and
Pallet
looking
behind
,
and
seeing
three
men
standing
upon
the
foot
-
board
armed
with
canes
,
which
his
fear
converted
into
fusils
,
never
doubted
that
his
friend
's
suspicion
was
just
;
but
,
shaking
his
jordan
at
the
imaginary
guard
,
swore
he
would
sooner
die
than
part
with
his
precious
ware
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
the
coach
,
who
was
a
nobleman
of
the
first
quality
,
mistook
him
for
some
unhappy
woman
deprived
of
her
senses
;
and
ordering
his
coachman
to
proceed
,
convinced
the
fugitive
,
to
his
infinite
joy
,
that
this
was
no
more
than
a
false
alarm
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
,
for
all
that
,
freed
from
anxiety
and
trepidation
;
but
our
young
gentleman
,
fearing
his
brain
would
not
bear
a
repetition
of
the
same
joke
,
permitted
him
to
gain
his
own
lodgings
,
without
further
molestation
.
    
<EOS>
His
landlady
meeting
him
on
the
stair
,
was
so
affected
at
his
appearance
,
that
she
screamed
aloud
,
and
betook
herself
to
flight
;
while
he
,
cursing
her
with
great
bitterness
,
rushed
into
the
apartment
of
the
doctor
,
who
,
instead
of
receiving
him
with
cordial
embraces
,
and
congratulating
him
upon
his
deliverance
,
gave
evident
tokens
of
umbrage
and
discontent
;
and
even
plainly
told
him
,
he
hoped
to
have
heard
that
he
and
Mr
Pickle
had
acted
the
glorious
part
of
Cato
;
an
event
which
would
have
laid
the
foundation
of
such
noble
struggles
,
as
could
not
fail
to
end
in
happiness
and
freedom
;
and
that
he
had
already
made
some
progress
in
an
ode
that
would
have
immortalized
their
names
,
and
inspired
the
flame
of
liberty
in
every
honest
breast
.
<EOS>
"
There
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
would
have
proved
,
<EOS>
that
great
talents
,
and
high
sentiments
of
liberty
,
do
reciprocally
produce
and
assist
each
other
;
and
illustrated
my
assertions
with
such
notes
and
quotations
from
the
Greek
writers
,
as
would
have
opened
the
eyes
of
the
most
blind
and
unthinking
,
and
touched
the
most
callous
and
obdurate
heart
.
<EOS>
O
fool
!
<EOS>
to
think
the
man
,
whose
ample
mind
must
grasp
whatever
yonder
stars
survey
  
<EOS>
Pray
,
Mr
Pallet
<EOS>
,
what
is
your
opinion
of
that
image
of
the
mind
's
grasping
the
whole
universe
?
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
ca
n't
help
thinking
it
the
most
happy
conception
that
ever
entered
my
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
,
who
was
not
such
a
flaming
enthusiast
in
the
cause
of
liberty
,
could
not
brook
the
doctor
's
reflexions
,
which
he
thought
savoured
a
little
too
much
of
indifference
and
deficiency
in
point
of
private
friendship
;
and
therefore
seized
the
present
opportunity
of
mortifying
his
pride
,
by
observing
,
that
the
image
was
,
without
all
doubt
,
very
grand
and
magnificent
;
but
that
he
had
been
obliged
for
the
idea
to
Mr
Bayes
in
The
Rehearsal
,
who
values
himself
upon
the
same
figure
,
conveyed
in
these
words
,
But
all
these
clouds
,
when
by
the
eye
of
reason
grasp'd
,
&
c.
Upon
any
other
occasion
,
the
painter
would
have
triumphed
greatly
in
this
detection
;
but
such
was
the
flutter
and
confusion
of
his
spirits
,
under
the
apprehension
of
being
retaken
,
that
without
further
communication
,
he
retreated
to
his
own
room
,
in
order
to
resume
his
own
dress
,
which
he
hoped
would
alter
his
appearance
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
baffle
all
search
and
examination
;
while
the
physician
remained
ashamed
and
abashed
,
to
find
himself
convicted
of
plagiarism
by
a
person
of
such
contemptible
talents
.
<EOS>
He
was
offended
at
this
proof
of
his
memory
,
and
so
much
enraged
at
his
presumption
in
exhibiting
it
,
that
he
could
never
forgive
his
want
of
reverence
,
and
took
every
opportunity
of
exposing
his
ignorance
and
folly
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
ties
of
private
affection
were
too
weak
to
engage
the
heart
of
this
republican
,
whose
zeal
for
the
community
had
entirely
swallowed
up
his
concern
for
individuals
.
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
particular
friendship
as
a
passion
unworthy
of
his
ample
soul
,
and
was
a
professed
admirer
of
L
Manlius
,
Junius
Brutus
,
and
those
later
patriots
of
the
same
name
,
who
shut
their
ears
against
the
cries
of
nature
,
and
resisted
all
the
dictates
of
gratitude
and
humanity
.

Chapter
LII
Pallet
conceives
an
hearty
contempt
for
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
and
attaches
himself
to
Pickle
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
persecutes
him
with
his
mischievous
talent
,
upon
the
road
to
Flanders
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
his
companion
having
employed
divers
pails
full
of
water
,
in
clearing
himself
from
the
squalor
of
a
jail
,
submitted
his
face
to
the
barber
,
tinged
his
eye
-
brows
with
a
sable
hue
,
and
being
dressed
in
his
own
cloaths
,
ventured
to
visit
Peregrine
,
who
was
still
under
the
hands
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
and
who
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
his
escape
had
been
connived
at
,
and
that
the
condition
of
their
deliverance
was
their
departure
from
Paris
in
three
days
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
was
transported
with
joy
,
when
he
learnt
that
he
ran
no
risque
of
being
retaken
;
and
far
from
repining
at
the
terms
of
his
enlargement
,
would
have
willingly
set
out
on
his
return
to
England
that
same
afternoon
;
for
the
Bastile
had
made
such
an
impression
upon
him
,
that
he
started
at
the
sound
of
every
coach
,
and
turned
pale
at
sight
of
a
French
soldier
.
<EOS>
In
the
fullness
of
his
heart
,
he
complained
of
the
doctor
's
indifference
,
and
related
what
had
passed
at
their
meeting
with
evident
marks
of
resentment
and
disrespect
;
which
were
not
at
all
diminished
,
when
Jolter
informed
him
of
the
physician
's
behaviour
,
when
he
sent
for
him
,
to
confer
about
the
means
of
abridging
their
confinement
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
himself
was
incensed
at
his
want
of
bowels
,
and
perceiving
how
much
he
had
sunk
in
the
opinion
of
his
fellow
-
traveller
,
resolved
to
encourage
these
sentiments
of
disgust
,
and
occasionally
foment
the
division
to
a
downright
quarrel
,
which
he
foresaw
would
produce
some
diversion
,
and
perhaps
expose
the
poet
's
character
in
such
a
light
,
as
would
effectually
punish
him
for
his
arrogance
and
barbarity
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
levelled
several
satirical
jokes
at
the
doctor
's
pedantry
and
want
of
taste
,
which
had
appeared
so
conspicuous
in
the
quotations
he
had
got
by
heart
,
from
ancient
authors
,
in
his
affected
disdain
of
the
best
pictures
in
the
world
;
which
,
had
he
been
endowed
with
the
least
share
of
discernment
,
he
could
not
have
beheld
with
such
insensibility
;
and
lastly
,
in
his
ridiculous
banquet
,
which
none
but
an
egregious
coxcomb
,
devoid
of
all
elegance
and
sense
,
would
have
prepared
,
or
presented
to
rational
beings
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
our
young
gentleman
played
the
artillery
of
his
wit
against
him
with
such
success
,
that
the
painter
seemed
to
wake
from
a
dream
,
and
went
home
with
the
most
hearty
contempt
for
the
person
he
had
formerly
adored
.
    
<EOS>
Instead
of
using
the
privilege
of
a
friend
,
to
enter
his
apartment
without
ceremony
,
he
sent
in
his
servant
with
a
message
,
importing
,
that
he
intended
to
set
out
from
Paris
next
day
,
in
company
with
Mr
Pickle
,
and
desiring
to
know
whether
or
not
he
was
,
or
would
be
prepared
for
the
journey
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
struck
with
the
manner
as
well
as
the
matter
of
this
intimation
,
went
immediately
to
Pallet
's
room
,
and
demanded
to
know
the
cause
of
such
a
sudden
determination
,
without
his
privity
or
concurrence
;
and
when
he
understood
the
necessity
of
their
affairs
,
rather
than
travel
by
himself
,
he
ordered
his
baggage
to
be
packed
up
,
and
signified
his
readiness
to
conform
to
the
emergency
of
the
case
;
though
he
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
cavalier
behaviour
of
Pallet
,
to
whom
he
threw
out
some
hints
of
his
own
importance
,
and
the
immensity
of
his
condescension
,
in
favouring
him
with
such
marks
of
regard
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
these
insinuations
had
lost
their
effect
upon
the
painter
,
who
told
him
with
an
arch
sneer
,
that
he
did
not
at
all
question
his
learning
and
abilities
,
and
particularly
his
skill
in
cookery
,
which
he
should
never
forget
while
his
palate
retained
its
function
;
but
nevertheless
advised
him
,
for
the
sake
of
the
degenerate
eaters
of
these
days
,
to
spare
a
little
of
his
sal
armoniac
in
the
next
sillykickaby
he
should
prepare
;
and
bate
somewhat
of
the
devil
's
dung
,
which
he
had
so
plentifully
crammed
into
the
roasted
fowls
,
unless
he
had
a
mind
to
convert
his
guests
into
patients
,
with
a
view
of
licking
himself
whole
for
the
expence
of
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
The
physician
,
nettled
at
these
sarcasms
,
eyed
him
with
a
look
of
indignation
and
disdain
,
and
being
unwilling
to
express
himself
in
English
,
lest
in
the
course
of
the
altercation
Pallet
should
be
so
much
irritated
as
to
depart
without
him
,
he
vented
his
anger
in
Greek
,
pronouncing
with
great
rancour
,

<EOS>
The
painter
though
by
the
sound
he
supposed
this
quotation
to
be
Greek
,
complimented
his
friend
upon
his
knowledge
in
the
Welch
language
,
and
found
means
to
rally
him
quite
out
of
temper
;
so
that
he
retired
to
his
own
chamber
in
the
utmost
wrath
and
mortification
,
and
left
his
antagonist
exulting
<EOS>
o'er
<EOS>
the
victory
he
had
won
.
    
<EOS>
While
these
things
passed
between
these
originals
,
Peregrine
waited
upon
the
Embassador
,
whom
he
thanked
for
his
kind
interposition
,
acknowledging
the
indiscretion
of
his
own
conduct
with
such
appearance
of
conviction
,
and
promises
of
reformation
,
that
his
Excellency
freely
forgave
him
for
all
the
trouble
he
had
been
put
to
on
his
account
,
fortified
him
with
sensible
advices
,
and
assuring
him
of
his
continual
favour
and
friendship
,
gave
him
at
parting
,
letters
of
introduction
to
several
persons
of
quality
belonging
to
the
British
court
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
distinguished
,
our
young
gentleman
took
leave
of
all
his
French
acquaintance
,
and
spent
the
evening
with
some
of
those
who
had
enjoyed
the
greatest
share
of
his
intimacy
and
confidence
;
while
Jolter
superintended
his
domestic
concerns
,
and
with
infinite
joy
bespoke
a
post
-
chaise
and
horses
,
in
orders
to
convey
him
from
a
place
where
he
lived
in
continual
apprehension
of
suffering
by
the
dangerous
disposition
of
his
pupil
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
being
adjusted
according
to
their
plan
,
they
and
their
fellow
-
travellers
next
day
dined
together
,
and
about
four
in
the
afternoon
took
their
departure
in
two
chaises
,
escorted
by
the
valet
de
chambre
,
Pipes
and
the
doctor
's
lacquey
on
horseback
,
well
furnished
with
arms
and
ammunition
,
in
case
of
being
attacked
by
robbers
on
the
road
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
about
eleven
o'clock
at
night
when
they
arrived
at
Senlis
,
which
was
the
place
at
which
they
proposed
to
lodge
,
and
where
they
were
obliged
to
knock
up
the
people
of
the
inn
,
before
they
could
have
their
supper
prepared
.
    
<EOS>
All
the
provision
in
the
house
was
but
barely
sufficient
to
furnish
one
indifferent
meal
;
however
,
the
painter
consoled
himself
for
the
quantity
with
the
quality
of
the
dishes
,
one
of
which
was
a
fricassee
of
rabbit
,
a
preparation
that
he
valued
above
all
the
dainties
that
ever
smoaked
upon
the
table
of
the
sumptuous
Heliogabalus
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
expressed
himself
to
this
effect
,
than
our
hero
,
who
was
almost
incessantly
laying
traps
for
diversion
at
his
neighbour
's
expence
,
laid
hold
on
the
declaration
;
and
recollecting
the
story
of
Scipio
and
the
muleteer
in
Gil
Blas
,
resolved
to
perpetrate
a
joke
upon
the
stomach
of
Pallet
,
which
seemed
particularly
well
disposed
to
an
hearty
supper
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
digested
his
plan
;
and
the
company
being
seated
at
table
,
affected
to
gaze
with
peculiar
eagerness
at
the
painter
,
who
had
helped
himself
to
a
large
portion
of
the
fricassee
,
and
began
to
swallow
it
with
infinite
relish
.
<EOS>
Pallet
,
notwithstanding
the
keenness
of
his
appetite
,
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
Pickle
's
demeanour
;
and
making
a
short
pause
in
the
exercise
of
his
grinders
,
"
You
are
surprized
(
said
he
)
to
see
me
make
so
much
dispatch
;
but
I
was
extremely
hungry
,
and
this
is
one
of
the
best
fricassees
I
ever
tasted
:
the
French
are
very
expert
in
these
dishes
,
that
I
must
allow
;
and
upon
my
conscience
,
I
would
never
desire
to
eat
a
more
delicate
rabbit
than
this
that
lies
upon
my
plate
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
made
no
other
reply
to
this
encomium
,
than
the
repetition
of
the
word
rabbit
!
<EOS>
with
a
note
of
admiration
,
and
such
a
significant
shake
of
the
head
,
as
effectually
alarmed
the
other
,
who
instantly
suspended
the
action
of
his
jaws
,
and
with
the
morsel
half
chewed
in
his
mouth
,
stared
round
him
with
a
certain
stolidity
of
apprehension
,
which
is
easier
conceived
than
described
,
until
his
eyes
encountered
the
countenance
of
Thomas
Pipes
,
who
being
instructed
,
and
posted
opposite
to
him
for
the
occasion
,
exhibited
an
arch
grin
,
that
compleated
the
painter
's
disorder
.
<EOS>
Afraid
of
swallowing
his
mouthful
,
and
ashamed
to
dispose
of
it
any
other
way
,
he
sat
some
time
in
a
most
distressed
state
of
suspence
;
and
being
questioned
by
Mr
Jolter
touching
his
calamity
,
made
a
violent
effort
of
the
muscles
of
his
gullet
,
which
with
difficulty
performed
their
office
;
and
then
,
with
great
confusion
and
concern
,
asked
if
Mr
Pickle
suspected
the
rabbit
's
identity
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
assuming
a
mysterious
air
,
pretended
ignorance
of
the
matter
,
observing
,
that
he
was
apt
to
suspect
all
dishes
of
that
kind
,
since
he
had
been
informed
of
the
tricks
which
were
commonly
played
at
inns
in
France
,
Italy
and
Spain
,
and
recounted
that
passage
in
Gil
Blas
,
which
we
have
hinted
at
above
;
saying
,
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
a
connoisseur
in
animals
,
but
the
legs
of
the
creature
which
composed
that
fricassee
did
not
,
in
his
opinion
,
resemble
those
of
the
rabbits
he
had
usually
seen
.
<EOS>
This
observation
had
an
evident
effect
upon
the
features
of
the
painter
,
who
with
certain
signs
of
loathing
and
astonishment
,
exclaimed
,
"
Lord
Jesus
!
"
and
appealed
to
Pipes
for
a
discovery
of
the
truth
,
by
asking
if
he
knew
any
thing
of
the
affair
.
<EOS>
Tom
very
gravely
replied
,
that
he
did
suppose
the
food
was
wholesome
enough
,
for
he
had
seen
the
skin
and
feet
of
a
special
ram
-
cat
,
new
flea'd
,
hanging
upon
the
door
of
a
small
pantry
adjoining
to
the
kitchen
.
    
<EOS>
Before
this
sentence
was
uttered
,
Pallet
's
belly
seemed
to
move
in
contact
with
his
back
-
bone
,
his
colour
changed
,
no
part
but
the
whites
of
his
eyes
were
to
be
seen
,
he
dropped
his
lower
jaw
,
and
fixing
his
hands
in
his
sides
,
reached
with
such
convulsive
agonies
,
as
amazed
and
disconcerted
the
whole
company
;
and
what
augmented
his
disorder
,
was
the
tenacious
retention
of
his
stomach
,
which
absolutely
refused
to
part
with
its
contents
,
notwithstanding
all
the
energy
of
his
abhorrence
,
which
threw
him
into
a
cold
sweat
,
and
almost
into
a
swoon
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
alarmed
at
his
condition
,
assured
him
it
was
a
genuine
rabbit
,
and
that
he
had
tutored
Pipes
to
say
otherwise
for
the
joke
's
sake
.
<EOS>
But
this
confession
he
considered
as
a
friendly
artifice
of
Pickle
's
compassion
,
and
therefore
it
had
little
effect
upon
his
constitution
.
<EOS>
By
the
assistance
,
however
,
of
a
large
bumper
of
brandy
,
his
spirits
were
recruited
,
and
his
recollection
so
far
recovered
,
that
he
was
able
to
declare
,
with
divers
contorsions
of
face
,
that
the
dish
had
a
particular
rankness
of
taste
,
which
he
had
imputed
partly
to
the
nature
of
the
French
coney
,
and
partly
to
the
composition
of
their
sauces
;
then
he
inveighed
against
the
infamous
practices
of
French
publicans
,
attributing
such
imposition
to
their
oppressive
government
,
which
kept
them
so
necessitous
,
that
they
were
tempted
to
exercise
all
manner
of
knavery
upon
their
unwary
guests
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
let
slip
any
opportunity
of
speaking
in
favour
of
the
French
,
told
him
that
he
was
a
very
great
stranger
to
their
police
,
else
he
would
know
,
that
if
upon
information
to
the
magistrate
,
it
should
appear
that
any
traveller
,
native
or
foreigner
,
has
been
imposed
upon
,
or
ill
-
treated
by
a
publican
,
the
offender
would
be
immediately
obliged
to
shut
up
his
house
,
and
if
his
behaviour
had
been
notorious
,
he
himself
would
be
sent
to
the
gallies
,
without
the
least
hesitation
;
and
as
for
the
dish
which
hath
been
made
the
occasion
of
your
present
disorder
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
will
take
upon
me
to
affirm
<EOS>
,
it
was
prepared
of
a
genuine
rabbit
,
which
was
skinned
in
my
presence
;
and
in
confirmation
of
what
I
assert
,
though
such
fricassees
are
not
the
favourites
of
my
taste
,
I
will
eat
a
part
of
this
without
scruple
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
swallowed
several
mouthfuls
of
the
questioned
coney
,
and
Pallet
seemed
to
eye
it
again
with
inclination
;
nay
,
he
even
resumed
his
knife
and
fork
,
and
being
just
on
the
point
of
applying
them
,
was
seized
with
another
qualm
of
apprehension
,
that
broke
out
in
an
exclamation
of
,
"
After
all
,
Mr
Jolter
,
if
it
should
be
a
real
ram
-
cat
 
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
here
is
one
of
the
claws
.
"
    
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
presented
the
tip
of
a
toe
,
of
which
Pipes
had
snipt
off
five
or
six
from
a
duck
that
was
roasted
,
and
purposely
scattered
them
in
the
fricassee
:
and
the
governor
could
not
behold
this
testimonial
without
symptoms
of
uneasiness
and
remorse
;
so
that
he
and
the
painter
sat
silenced
and
abashed
,
and
made
faces
at
each
other
,
while
the
physician
,
who
hated
them
both
,
exulted
over
their
affliction
,
bidding
them
be
of
good
chear
,
and
proceed
with
their
meal
;
for
he
was
ready
to
demonstrate
,
that
the
flesh
of
a
cat
was
as
nourishing
and
delicious
as
veal
or
mutton
,
provided
they
could
prove
,
that
the
said
cat
was
not
of
the
boar
-
kind
,
and
had
fed
chiefly
on
vegetable
diet
,
or
even
confined
its
carnivorous
appetite
to
rats
and
mice
,
which
he
affirmed
to
be
dainties
of
exquisite
taste
and
flavour
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
it
was
a
vulgar
mistake
to
think
that
all
flesh
-
deavouring
creatures
were
unfit
to
be
eaten
;
witness
the
consumption
of
swine
and
ducks
,
animals
that
delight
in
carnage
,
as
well
as
fish
,
that
prey
upon
each
other
,
and
feed
on
bait
and
carrion
;
together
with
the
demand
for
bear
,
of
which
the
best
hams
in
the
world
are
made
.
<EOS>
He
then
observed
,
that
the
Negroes
on
the
coast
of
Guinea
,
who
are
a
healthy
and
vigorous
people
,
prefer
cats
and
dogs
to
all
other
fare
;
and
mentioned
from
history
several
sieges
,
during
which
the
inhabitants
,
who
were
blocked
up
,
lived
upon
these
animals
,
and
had
recourse
even
to
human
flesh
,
which
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
was
in
all
respects
preferable
to
pork
;
for
,
in
the
course
of
his
studies
,
he
had
,
for
the
experiment
's
sake
,
eaten
a
steak
cut
from
the
buttock
of
a
person
who
had
been
hanged
.
    
<EOS>
This
dissertation
,
far
from
composing
,
increased
the
disquiet
in
the
stomachs
of
the
governor
and
painter
,
who
hearing
the
last
illustration
,
turned
their
eyes
upon
the
orator
,
at
the
same
instant
,
with
looks
of
horror
and
disgust
;
and
the
one
muttering
the
term
Cannibal
,
and
the
other
pronouncing
the
word
abomination
,
they
rose
from
table
in
a
great
hurry
,
and
running
towards
another
apartment
,
justled
with
such
violence
in
the
passage
,
that
both
were
overturned
by
the
shock
,
which
also
contributed
to
the
effect
of
their
nausea
,
that
mutually
defiled
them
as
they
lay
.

Chapter
LIII
   
<EOS>
Though
Pickle
enjoyed
their
disaster
,
he
was
resolved
to
practise
some
invention
upon
the
doctor
,
that
he
might
not
triumph
in
his
revenge
with
impunity
;
and
thus
determined
,
when
Pallet
had
overcome
the
malady
of
his
own
imagination
,
he
imparted
to
him
a
plan
of
reprizal
,
which
agreeably
flattered
his
resentment
,
and
was
executed
in
this
manner
:
as
the
painter
and
physician
lay
in
separate
beds
in
the
same
chamber
,
the
former
watched
,
till
by
the
other
's
snoring
he
was
certified
of
his
being
fast
asleep
;
then
moving
softly
to
the
door
,
where
Pipes
stood
ready
furnished
for
the
purpose
,
took
a
tea
-
kettle
full
of
warm
water
,
and
cautiously
conveying
the
spout
under
the
cloaths
of
the
doctor
's
bed
,
poured
in
the
liquor
,
imperceptibly
,
to
the
quantity
of
half
a
gallon
,
and
then
retired
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
undertaken
to
rouze
his
fellow
-
travellers
in
the
morning
,
entered
the
doctor
's
apartment
with
the
dawn
,
and
waked
them
both
with
the
same
hollow
.
<EOS>
The
painter
immediately
sprung
out
of
bed
;
but
the
physician
,
finding
himself
drenched
from
head
to
foot
,
was
equally
astonished
and
ashamed
,
never
doubting
that
he
had
unfortunately
bedewed
himself
in
his
sleep
.
    
<EOS>
This
mistake
he
thought
so
inconsistent
with
the
dignity
of
his
character
,
that
he
durst
not
venture
to
disclose
his
condition
,
especially
as
he
well
knew
how
eagerly
the
company
would
seize
such
an
occasion
of
making
merry
at
his
expence
;
and
it
would
be
impracticable
to
conceal
it
from
their
knowledge
,
if
he
should
be
obliged
to
get
up
in
their
presence
:
he
therefore
lay
still
in
the
utmost
perplexity
and
tribulation
,
while
his
two
companions
,
guessing
his
thoughts
,
and
rejoicing
at
his
anxiety
,
sat
down
by
his
bedside
,
and
exhorted
him
to
rise
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
,
that
having
sweated
profusely
all
night
,
he
could
not
,
with
any
regard
to
his
health
,
get
up
,
until
he
should
be
shifted
,
and
the
pores
of
his
skin
regularly
closed
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
desired
they
would
take
the
trouble
of
seeing
the
horses
put
to
the
chaises
,
and
the
reckoning
adjusted
;
assuring
them
,
he
should
be
ready
to
attend
them
before
their
business
could
be
dispatched
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Jolter
had
charged
himself
with
the
payment
of
the
bill
,
and
the
servants
were
now
employed
about
the
carriages
,
so
that
he
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
;
he
therefore
rung
the
bell
for
his
footman
,
and
bade
him
bring
a
clean
shirt
for
his
master
with
all
possible
speed
.
    
<EOS>
Ere
<EOS>
the
fellow
returned
,
it
was
broad
day
;
and
a
message
came
from
the
governor
,
importing
that
the
horses
were
yoked
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
's
confusion
increased
,
he
was
tortured
by
the
looks
,
and
baited
by
the
importunities
of
his
company
;
and
moreover
,
suffered
the
uncomfortable
situation
of
being
steeped
,
as
he
imagined
,
in
his
own
brine
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
Peregrine
,
impatient
of
his
delay
,
took
the
privilege
of
a
comrade
,
and
accusing
the
republican
of
sloth
,
pulled
off
the
bed
-
cloaths
at
one
snatch
,
and
displayed
him
at
full
length
,
in
this
opprobrious
condition
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
seeing
him
thus
exposed
,
lifted
up
his
hands
,
and
in
affected
astonishment
,
"
Lord
watch
over
us
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
the
doctor
is
a
dead
man
;
sure
the
whole
sap
of
his
body
is
run
out
,
or
have
you
spilt
a
whole
dish
of
sillykickaby
in
the
bed
?
<EOS>
for
it
smells
cursedly
strong
of
sal
armoniac
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
order
to
compleat
the
physician
's
overthrow
,
shut
up
his
nostrils
with
his
finger
and
thumb
,
and
asked
in
a
snuffling
tone
,
if
he
was
subject
to
that
infirmity
.
    
<EOS>
Unspeakable
were
the
shame
and
vexation
of
the
modern
Pindar
on
this
occasion
;
he
was
at
the
same
time
tormented
with
all
the
pangs
which
mortified
vanity
can
feel
,
and
agitated
by
all
the
furies
of
resentment
against
the
persons
who
had
detected
his
disgrace
,
and
who
having
thus
insulted
him
in
his
distress
,
quitted
the
room
with
a
loud
laugh
,
leaving
him
to
the
thorny
reflections
of
his
own
pride
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
could
the
painter
,
who
was
not
at
all
to
be
praised
for
his
moderation
,
abstain
from
certain
ill
-
natured
allusions
to
his
calamity
,
which
by
these
means
reached
the
ears
of
the
governor
,
from
whom
(
of
all
men
)
<EOS>
he
desired
to
keep
it
concealed
;
so
that
he
remained
sullen
and
dejected
during
the
whole
journey
:
not
but
that
he
attempted
to
recover
his
importance
,
by
haranguing
upon
the
Roman
highways
,
when
Mr
Jolter
desired
the
company
to
take
notice
of
the
fine
pavement
upon
which
they
travelled
from
Paris
into
Flanders
;
but
Pallet
,
who
thought
he
had
now
gained
the
ascendency
over
the
physician
,
exerted
himself
in
maintaining
the
superiority
he
had
acquired
,
by
venting
various
sarcasms
upon
his
self
-
conceit
and
affectation
of
learning
,
and
even
uttering
puns
and
conundrums
upon
the
remarks
which
the
republican
retailed
.
<EOS>
When
he
talked
of
the
Flaminian
Way
,
the
painter
questioned
if
it
was
a
better
pavement
than
the
Fleminian
way
on
which
they
travelled
:
and
the
doctor
having
observed
,
that
this
road
was
made
for
the
convenience
of
drawing
the
French
artillery
into
Flanders
,
which
was
often
the
seat
of
war
;
his
competitor
in
wit
replied
with
infinite
vivacity
,
"
There
are
more
great
guns
than
the
French
king
knows
of
drawn
along
this
causeway
,
doctor
.
"
    
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
the
success
of
these
efforts
,
which
tickled
the
imagination
of
Jolter
,
and
drew
smiles
(
as
he
imagined
)
of
approbation
from
our
hero
,
he
sported
in
many
other
aequivoques
of
the
same
nature
;
and
at
dinner
told
the
physician
,
that
he
was
like
the
root
of
the
tongue
,
as
being
cursedly
down
in
the
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
such
was
the
animosity
subsisting
between
these
quondam
friends
,
that
they
never
conversed
together
,
except
with
a
view
of
exposing
each
other
to
the
ridicule
or
contempt
of
their
fellow
-
travellers
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
at
great
pains
to
point
out
the
folly
and
ignorance
of
Pallet
in
private
to
Peregrine
,
who
was
often
conjured
in
the
same
manner
by
the
painter
,
to
take
notice
of
the

want

manners
and

.
<EOS>
Pickle
pretended
to
acquiesce
in
the
truth
of
their
mutual
severity
,
which
indeed
was
extremely
just
,
and
by
malicious
insinuations
blew
up
their
contention
,
with
a
view
of
bringing
it
to
open
hostility
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
both
seemed
so
averse
to
deeds
of
mortal
purpose
,
that
for
a
long
time
his
arts
were
baffled
,
and
he
could
not
spirit
them
up
to
any
pitch
of
resentment
higher
than
scurrilous
repartee
.
    
<EOS>
Before
they
reached
Arras
,
the
city
-
gates
were
shut
,
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
take
up
their
lodging
at
an
indifferent
house
in
the
suburbs
,
where
they
found
a
couple
of
French
officers
,
who
had
also
rode
post
from
Paris
,
so
far
on
their
way
to
Lisle
.
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
were
about
the
age
of
thirty
,
and
their
deportment
distinguished
by
such
an
air
of
insolence
,
as
disgusted
our
hero
,
who
,
nevertheless
,
accosted
them
politely
in
the
yard
,
and
proposed
that
they
should
sup
together
.
<EOS>
They
thanked
him
for
the
honour
of
his
invitation
,
which
,
however
,
they
declined
,
upon
pretence
of
having
ordered
something
for
themselves
;
but
promised
to
wait
upon
him
and
his
company
immediately
after
their
repast
.
    
<EOS>
This
they
accordingly
performed
;
and
after
having
drank
a
few
glasses
of
Burgundy
,
one
of
them
asked
,
if
the
young
gentleman
would
,
for
pastime
,
take
an
hand
at
quadrille
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
easily
divined
the
meaning
of
this
proposal
,
which
was
made
with
no
other
view
than
that
of
fleecing
him
and
his
fellow
-
travellers
;
for
he
well
knew
to
what
shifts
<EOS>
a
subaltern
in
the
French
service
is
reduced
,
in
order
to
maintain
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
,
and
had
reason
to
believe
that
most
of
them
were
sharpers
from
their
youth
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
depended
a
good
deal
upon
his
own
penetration
and
address
,
he
gratified
the
stranger
's
desire
;
and
a
party
was
instantly
formed
of
the
painter
,
the
physician
,
the
proposer
and
himself
,
the
other
officer
having
professed
himself
utterly
ignorant
of
the
game
;
yet
,
in
the
course
of
the
play
,
he
took
his
station
at
the
back
of
Pickle
's
chair
,
which
was
opposite
to
his
friend
,
on
pretence
of
himself
with
seeing
his
manner
of
conducting
the
cards
.
<EOS>
The
youth
was
not
such
a
novice
but
that
he
perceived
the
design
of
this
palpable
piece
of
behaviour
,
which
,
notwithstanding
,
he
overlook'd
<EOS>
for
the
present
,
with
a
view
of
flattering
their
hopes
in
the
beginning
,
that
they
might
be
the
more
effectually
punished
,
by
their
disappointment
in
the
end
.
    
<EOS>
The
game
was
scarce
begun
,
when
by
the
reflection
of
a
glass
he
discerned
the
officer
at
his
back
,
making
signs
to
his
companion
,
who
,
by
these
pre
-
concerted
gestures
,
was
perfectly
informed
of
the
contents
of
Peregrine
's
hand
,
and
of
consequence
fortunate
in
the
course
of
play
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
they
were
allowed
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
their
dexterity
,
until
their
money
amounted
to
some
Loui
's
;
when
our
young
gentleman
,
thinking
it
high
time
to
do
himself
justice
,
signified
in
very
polite
terms
to
the
gentleman
who
stood
behind
him
,
that
he
could
never
play
with
ease
and
deliberation
when
he
was
overlooked
by
any
by
-
stander
,
and
begg'd
that
he
would
have
the
goodness
to
be
seated
.
    
<EOS>
As
this
was
a
remonstrance
which
the
stranger
could
not
with
any
shew
of
breeding
resist
,
he
asked
pardon
,
and
retired
to
the
chair
of
the
physician
,
who
frankly
told
him
,
that
it
was
not
the
fashion
of
his
country
for
one
to
submit
his
hand
to
the
perusal
of
a
spectator
;
and
when
,
in
consequence
of
this
rebuff
,
he
wanted
to
quarter
himself
upon
the
painter
,
he
was
refused
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
,
and
a
shake
of
the
head
,
with
an
exclamation
of
,
Pardonnez
moi
!
<EOS>
which
was
repeated
with
such
emphasis
,
as
discomposed
his
effrontery
,
and
he
found
himself
obliged
to
sit
down
in
a
state
of
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
The
odds
being
thus
removed
,
fortune
proceeded
in
her
usual
channel
;
and
though
the
Frenchman
,
deprived
of
his
ally
,
endeavoured
to
practise
divers
strokes
of
finesse
,
the
rest
of
the
company
observed
him
with
such
vigilance
and
caution
,
as
baffled
all
his
attempts
,
and
in
a
very
little
time
he
was
compelled
to
part
with
his
winning
:
but
having
engaged
in
the
match
with
an
intention
of
taking
all
advantages
,
whether
fair
or
unfair
,
that
his
superior
skill
should
give
him
over
the
Englishmen
,
the
money
was
not
refunded
without
a
thousand
disputes
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
essayed
to
intimidate
his
antagonist
with
high
words
,
which
were
retorted
by
our
hero
with
such
interest
,
as
convinced
him
that
he
had
mistaken
his
man
,
and
persuaded
him
to
make
his
retreat
in
quiet
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
it
was
not
without
cause
that
they
repined
at
the
bad
success
of
their
enterprize
;
because
,
in
all
likelihood
,
they
had
nothing
to
depend
upon
for
the
present
but
their
own
industry
,
and
knew
not
how
to
defray
their
expences
on
the
road
,
except
by
some
acquisition
of
this
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
they
rose
at
day
-
break
,
and
resolving
to
anticipate
their
fellow
-
lodgers
,
bespoke
post
-
horses
as
soon
as
they
could
be
admitted
into
the
city
;
so
that
when
our
company
appeared
,
their
beasts
were
ready
in
the
yard
;
and
they
only
waited
to
discuss
the
bill
,
which
they
had
ordered
to
be
made
out
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
inn
presented
his
carte
with
fear
and
trembling
to
one
of
those
ferocious
cavaliers
,
who
no
sooner
cast
his
eye
upon
the
sum
total
,
than
he
discharged
a
volley
of
dreadful
oaths
,
and
asked
if
the
king
's
officers
were
to
be
treated
in
that
manner
.
    
<EOS>
The
poor
publican
protested
with
great
humility
,
that
he
had
the
utmost
respect
for
his
majesty
,
and
every
thing
that
belonged
to
him
;
and
that
,
far
from
consulting
his
own
interest
,
all
that
he
desired
was
,
to
be
barely
indemnified
for
the
expence
of
their
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
This
condescension
seemed
to
have
no
other
effect
than
that
of
encouraging
their
arrogance
.
<EOS>
They
swore
his
extortion
should
be
explained
to
the
commandant
of
the
town
,
who
would
,
by
making
him
a
public
example
,
teach
other
inn
-
keepers
how
to
behave
towards
men
of
honour
;
and
threatened
with
such
confidence
of
indignation
,
that
the
wretched
landlord
,
dreading
the
consequence
of
their
wrath
,
implored
pardon
in
the
most
abject
manner
,
begging
with
many
supplications
,
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
lodging
them
at
his
own
charge
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
favour
<EOS>
which
he
with
great
difficulty
obtained
;
they
chid
him
severely
for
his
imposition
,
exhorted
him
to
have
more
regard
for
his
own
conscience
,
as
well
as
for
the
convenience
of
his
guests
;
and
cautioning
him
in
particular
touching
his
behaviour
to
the
gentlemen
of
the
army
,
mounted
their
horses
,
and
rode
off
in
great
state
,
leaving
him
very
thankful
for
having
so
successfully
appeased
the
choler
of
two
officers
,
who
wanted
either
inclination
or
ability
to
pay
their
bill
<EOS>
:
for
experience
had
taught
him
to
be
apprehensive
of
all
such
travellers
,
who
commonly
lay
the
landlord
under
contribution
,
by
way
of
atonement
for
the
extravagance
of
his
demands
,
even
after
he
has
professed
his
willingness
to
entertain
them
on
their
own
terms
.

Chapter
LIV
   
<EOS>
These
honourable
adventurers
being
gone
,
Peregrine
,
who
was
present
during
the
transaction
,
informed
himself
of
the
particulars
from
the
mouth
of
the
inn
-
keeper
himself
,
who
took
God
and
the
saints
to
witness
,
that
he
should
have
been
a
loser
by
their
custom
,
even
if
the
bill
had
been
paid
;
because
he
was
on
his
guard
against
their
objections
,
and
had
charged
every
article
at
an
under
price
:
but
such
was
the
authority
of
officers
in
France
,
that
he
durst
not
dispute
the
least
circumstance
of
their
will
;
for
had
the
case
come
under
the
cognizance
of
the
magistrate
,
he
must
in
course
have
suffered
by
the
maxims
of
their
government
,
which
never
fail
to
abet
the
oppression
of
the
army
;
and
besides
,
run
the
risque
of
incurring
their
future
resentment
,
which
would
be
sufficient
to
ruin
him
from
top
to
bottom
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
boiled
with
indignation
at
this
instance
of
injustice
and
arbitrary
power
;
and
turning
to
his
governor
,
asked
if
this
too
was
a
proof
of
the
happiness
enjoyed
by
the
French
people
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
replied
,
that
every
human
constitution
must
in
some
things
be
imperfect
;
and
owned
,
that
in
this
kingdom
gentlemen
were
more
countenanced
than
the
vulgar
,
because
it
was
to
be
presumed
,
that
their
own
sentiments
of
honour
and
superior
qualifications
,
would
entitle
them
to
this
preheminence
,
which
had
also
a
retrospective
view
to
the
merit
of
their
ancestors
,
in
consideration
of
which
they
were
at
first
ennobled
:
but
he
affirmed
,
that
the
inn
-
keeper
had
misrepresented
the
magistracy
,
which
in
France
never
failed
to
punish
flagrant
outrages
and
abuse
,
without
respect
of
persons
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
approved
of
the
wisdom
of
the
French
government
,
in
bridling
the
insolence
of
the
mob
,
by
which
,
he
assured
them
,
he
had
often
suffered
in
his
own
person
;
having
been
often
bespattered
by
hackney
-
coachmen
,
justled
by
draymen
and
porters
,
and
reviled
in
the
most
opprobrious
terms
by
the
watermen
of
London
,
where
he
had
once
lost
his
bag
,
and
a
considerable
quantity
of
hair
,
which
had
been
cut
off
by
some
rascal
in
his
passage
through
Ludgate
,
during
the
lord
mayor
's
procession
.
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
the
doctor
with
great
warmth
alledged
,
that
those
officers
ought
to
suffer
death
,
or
banishment
at
least
,
for
having
plundered
the
people
in
this
manner
,
which
was
so
impudent
and
barefaced
,
as
plainly
to
prove
they
were
certain
of
escaping
with
impunity
,
and
that
they
were
old
offenders
in
the
same
degree
of
delinquency
.
    
<EOS>
He
said
,
that
the
greatest
man
in
Athens
would
have
been
condemned
to
perpetual
exile
,
and
seen
his
estate
confiscated
for
public
use
,
had
he
dared
in
such
a
licentious
manner
to
violate
the
rights
of
a
fellow
-
citizen
:
and
as
for
the
little
affronts
to
which
a
man
may
be
subject
,
from
the
petulance
of
the
multitude
,
he
looked
upon
them
as
glorious
indications
of
liberty
,
which
ought
not
to
be
repressed
,
and
would
at
any
time
rejoice
to
find
himself
overthrown
in
a
kennel
by
the
insolence
of
a
son
of
freedom
,
even
though
the
fall
should
cost
him
a
limb
:
adding
,
by
way
of
illustration
,
that
the
greatest
pleasure
he
ever
enjoyed
,
was
in
seeing
a
dustman
wilfully
overturn
a
gentleman
's
coach
,
in
which
two
ladies
were
bruised
,
even
to
the
danger
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
Pallet
,
shocked
at
the
extravagance
of
this
declaration
,
"
If
that
be
the
case
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
wish
you
may
see
every
bone
in
your
body
broke
,
by
the
first
carman
you
meet
in
the
streets
of
London
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
argument
being
discussed
,
and
the
reckoning
discharged
without
any
deduction
,
although
the
landlord
,
in
stating
the
articles
,
had
an
eye
to
the
loss
he
had
sustained
by
his
own
countrymen
,
they
departed
form
Arras
,
and
arrived
in
safety
at
Lisle
,
about
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
.
    
<EOS>
They
had
scarce
taken
possession
of
their
lodgings
,
in
a
large
hotel
on
the
Grande
Place
,
when
the
inn
-
keeper
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
he
kept
an
ordinary
below
,
which
was
frequented
by
several
English
gentlemen
who
resided
in
town
,
and
that
dinner
was
then
upon
the
table
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
seized
all
opportunities
of
observing
new
characters
,
persuaded
his
company
to
dine
in
public
;
and
they
were
accordingly
conducted
to
the
place
,
where
they
found
a
mixture
of
Scotch
and
Dutch
officers
,
who
had
come
from
Holland
to
learn
their
exercises
at
the
academy
,
and
some
gentlemen
in
the
French
service
,
who
were
upon
garison
-
duty
in
the
citadel
.
<EOS>
Among
these
last
was
a
person
about
the
age
of
fifty
,
of
a
remarkably
genteel
air
and
polite
address
,
dignified
with
a
Maltese
cross
,
and
distinguished
by
the
particular
veneration
of
all
those
who
knew
him
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
understood
that
Pickle
and
his
friends
were
travellers
,
he
accosted
the
youth
in
English
,
which
he
spoke
tolerably
well
;
and
as
they
were
strangers
,
offered
to
attend
them
in
the
afternoon
to
all
the
places
worth
seeing
in
Lisle
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
thanked
him
for
his
excess
of
politeness
,
which
(
he
said
)
was
peculiar
to
the
French
nation
;
and
struck
with
his
engaging
appearance
,
industriously
courted
his
conversation
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
learnt
,
that
this
chevalier
was
a
man
of
good
sense
and
great
experience
,
that
he
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
the
greatest
part
of
Europe
,
had
lived
some
years
in
England
,
and
was
no
stranger
to
the
constitution
and
genius
of
that
people
.
    
<EOS>
Having
dined
,
and
drank
to
the
healths
of
the
English
and
French
kings
,
two
Fiacres
were
called
,
in
one
of
which
the
knight
,
with
one
of
his
companions
,
the
governor
and
Peregrine
seated
themselves
,
the
other
being
occupied
by
the
physician
,
Pallet
,
and
two
Scottish
officers
,
who
proposed
to
accompany
them
in
their
circuit
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
place
they
visited
was
the
citadel
,
round
the
ramparts
of
which
they
walked
,
under
the
conduct
of
the
knight
,
who
explained
with
great
accuracy
the
intention
of
every
particular
fortification
belonging
to
that
seemingly
impregnable
fortress
;
and
when
they
had
satisfied
their
curiosity
,
took
coach
again
,
in
order
to
view
the
arsenal
,
which
stands
in
another
quarter
of
the
town
:
<EOS>
but
,
just
as
Pickle
's
carriage
had
crossed
the
Promenade
,
he
heard
his
own
name
bawled
aloud
by
the
painter
;
and
ordering
the
Fiacre
to
stop
,
saw
Pallet
with
one
half
of
his
body
thrust
out
at
the
window
of
the
other
coach
,
crying
with
a
terrified
look
,
"
<EOS>
Mr

Mr

Peregrine
,
surprized
at
this
exclamation
,
immediately
alighted
,
and
advancing
to
the
other
vehicle
,
found
one
of
their
military
companions
standing
upon
the
ground
,
at
the
further
side
of
the
coach
,
with
his
sword
drawn
,
and
fury
in
his
countenance
;
and
the
physician
,
with
a
quivering
lip
and
haggard
aspect
,
struggling
with
the
other
,
who
had
interposed
in
the
quarrel
,
and
detained
him
in
his
place
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
upon
inquiry
,
found
that
this
animosity
had
sprung
from
a
dispute
that
happened
upon
the
ramparts
,
touching
the
strength
of
the
fortification
,
which
the
doctor
,
according
to
custom
,
undervalued
,
because
it
was
a
modern
work
;
saying
,
that
by
the
help
of
the
military
engines
used
among
the
ancients
,
and
a
few
thousands
of
pioneers
,
he
would
engage
to
take
it
in
less
than
ten
days
after
he
should
sit
down
before
it
.
<EOS>
The
North
-
Briton
,
who
was
as
great
a
pedant
as
the
physician
,
having
studied
fortification
,
and
made
himself
master
of
Caesar
's
Commentaries
and
Polybius
,
with
the
observations
of
Folard
,
affirmed
,
that
all
the
methods
of
besieging
practised
by
the
ancients
,
would
be
utterly
ineffectual
against
such
a
plan
as
that
of
the
citadel
of
Lisle
;
and
began
to
compare
the
Vineae
,
Aggeres
,
Arietes
,
Scorpiones
and
Catapultae
of
the
Romans
,
with
the
trenches
,
mines
,
batteries
and
mortars
used
in
the
present
art
of
war
.
    
<EOS>
The
republican
,
finding
himself
attacked
upon
what
he
thought
his
strong
side
,
summoned
all
his
learning
to
his
aid
;
and
describing
the
famous
siege
of
Plataea
,
happened
to
misquote
a
passage
of
Thucydides
,
in
which
he
was
corrected
by
the
other
,
who
having
been
educated
for
the
church
,
was
also
a
connoisseur
in
the
Greek
language
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
incensed
at
being
detected
in
such
a
blunder
,
in
presence
of
Pallet
,
who
(
he
knew
)
would
promulgate
his
shame
,
told
the
officer
,
with
great
arrogance
,
that
his
objection
was
frivolous
,
and
that
he
must
not
pretend
to
dispute
on
these
matters
with
one
who
had
considered
them
with
the
utmost
accuracy
and
care
.
<EOS>
His
antagonist
,
piqued
at
this
supercilious
insinuation
,
replied
with
great
heat
,
that
for
ought
he
knew
,
the
doctor
might
be
a
very
expert
apothecary
,
but
that
in
the
art
of
war
,
and
knowledge
in
the
Greek
tongue
,
he
was
no
other
than
an
ignorant
pretender
.
<EOS>
This
asseveration
produced
an
answer
full
of
virulence
,
including
a
national
reflection
upon
the
soldier
's
country
;
and
the
contention
rose
to
mutual
abuse
,
when
it
was
suppressed
by
the
admonitions
of
the
other
two
,
who
begged
they
would
not
expose
themselves
in
a
strange
place
,
but
behave
themselves
like
fellow
-
subjects
and
friends
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
ceased
reviling
each
other
,
and
the
affair
was
seemingly
forgot
;
but
,
after
they
had
resumed
their
places
in
the
coach
,
the
painter
unfortunately
asked
the
meaning
of
the
word
Tortoise
,
which
he
had
heard
them
mention
among
the
Roman
implements
of
war
.
    
<EOS>
This
question
was
answered
by
the
physician
,
who
described
the
nature
of
this
expedient
so
little
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
officer
,
that
he
contradicted
him
flatly
,
in
the
midst
of
his
explanation
;
a
circumstance
which
provoked
the
republican
to
such
a
degree
,
that
in
the
temerity
of
his
passion
,
he
uttered
the
epithet
impertinent
scoundrel
;
which
was
no
sooner
pronounced
than
the
Caledonian
made
manual
application
to
his
nose
,
and
leaping
out
of
the
coach
,
stood
waiting
for
him
on
the
plain
;
while
he
(
the
physician
)
made
feeble
efforts
to
join
him
,
being
easily
retained
by
the
other
soldier
;
and
Pallet
,
dreading
the
consequence
in
which
he
himself
might
be
involved
,
bellowed
aloud
for
prevention
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
endeavoured
to
quiet
the
commotion
,
by
representing
to
the
Scot
,
that
he
had
already
taken
satisfaction
for
the
injury
he
had
received
;
and
telling
the
doctor
,
that
he
had
deserved
the
chastisement
which
was
inflicted
upon
him
:
but
the
officer
(
encouraged
perhaps
by
the
confusion
of
his
antagonist
)
insisted
upon
his
asking
pardon
for
what
he
had
said
;
and
the
doctor
,
believing
himself
under
the
protection
of
his
friend
Pickle
,
far
from
agreeing
to
such
concession
,
breathed
nothing
but
defiance
and
revenge
:
so
that
the
chevalier
,
in
order
to
prevent
mischief
,
put
the
soldier
under
arrest
,
and
sent
him
to
his
lodgings
,
under
the
care
of
the
other
French
gentleman
and
his
own
companion
;
they
being
also
accompanied
by
Mr
Jolter
,
who
having
formerly
seen
all
the
curiosities
of
Lisle
,
willingly
surrendered
his
place
to
the
physician
.

Chapter
LV
Pickle
engages
with
a
knight
of
Malta
,
in
a
conversation
upon
the
English
stage
,
which
is
followed
by
a
dissertation
on
the
theatres
of
the
ancients
,
by
the
doctor
.
   
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
company
proceeded
to
the
arsenal
,
which
having
viewed
,
together
with
some
remarkable
churches
,
they
,
in
their
return
,
went
to
the
comedy
,
and
saw
the
Cid
of
Corneille
tolerably
well
represented
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
entertainment
,
the
discourse
at
supper
turned
upon
dramatic
performances
;
and
all
the
objections
of
Mons
de
Scudery
to
the
piece
they
had
seen
acted
,
together
with
the
decision
of
the
French
academy
,
were
canvassed
and
discussed
.
<EOS>
The
knight
was
a
man
of
letters
and
taste
,
and
particularly
well
acquainted
with
the
state
of
the
English
stage
;
so
that
when
the
painter
boldly
pronounced
sentence
against
the
French
manner
of
acting
,
on
the
strength
of
having
frequented
a
Covent
-
Garden
club
of
criticks
,
and
been
often
admitted
by
virtue
of
an
order
,
into
the
pit
;
a
comparison
immediately
ensued
,
not
between
the
authors
,
but
the
actors
of
both
nations
,
to
whom
the
chevalier
and
Peregrine
were
no
strangers
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
like
a
good
Englishman
,
made
no
scruple
of
giving
the
preference
to
the
performers
of
his
own
country
,
who
,
he
alledged
,
obeyed
the
genuine
impulses
of
nature
,
in
exhibiting
the
passions
of
the
human
mind
;
and
entered
so
warmly
into
the
spirit
of
their
several
parts
,
that
they
often
fancied
themselves
the
very
heroes
they
represented
.
    
<EOS>
Whereas
,
the
action
of
the
Parisian
players
,
even
in
their
most
interesting
characters
,
was
generally
such
an
extravagance
in
voice
and
gesture
,
as
is
no
where
to
be
observed
<EOS>
but
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
To
illustrate
this
assertion
,
he
availed
himself
of
his
talent
,
and
mimicked
the
manner
and
voice
of
all
the
principal
performers
,
male
and
female
,
belonging
to
the
French
comedy
;
to
the
admiration
of
the
chevalier
,
who
having
complimented
him
upon
this
surprising
modulation
,
begged
leave
to
dissent
in
some
particulars
from
the
opinion
he
had
avowed
.
<EOS>
"
That
you
have
good
actors
in
England
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
it
would
be
unjust
and
absurd
in
me
to
deny
;
your
theatre
is
adorned
by
one
woman
,
whose
sensibility
and
sweetness
of
voice
is
such
as
I
have
never
observed
on
any
other
stage
;
she
has
,
besides
,
an
elegance
of
person
and
expression
of
features
,
that
wonderfully
adapt
her
for
the
most
engaging
characters
of
your
best
plays
;
and
I
must
freely
own
that
I
have
been
as
highly
delighted
,
and
as
deeply
affected
,
by
a
Monimia
and
Belvidera
at
London
,
as
ever
I
was
by
a
Cornelia
and
Cleopatra
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
You
can
,
moreover
,
boast
of
several
comic
actors
who
are
perfect
masters
of
buffoonery
and
grimace
;
though
,
to
be
free
with
you
,
I
think
,
in
these
qualifications
you
are
excelled
by
the
players
of
Amsterdam
:
neither
are
you
destitute
of
those
,
who
,
with
a
good
deal
of
cultivation
,
might
acquire
some
degree
of
excellence
in
the
representation
of
tragic
characters
:
but
I
shall
never
cease
to
wonder
that
the
English
,
who
are
certainly
a
sensible
and
discerning
people
should
be
so
much
infatuated
,
as
to
applaud
and
caress
with
the
most
extravagant
approbation
,
not
to
say
adoration
and
regard
,
one
or
two
gracioso
's
,
who
,
I
will
be
bold
to
say
,
would
scarce
be
able
to
earn
their
bread
by
their
talents
,
on
any
other
theatre
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
I
have
seen
one
of
these
,
in
the
celebrated
part
of
Richard
the
third
,
which
,
I
believe
,
is
not
a
character
of
ridicule
,
sollicit
and
triumph
in
the
laugh
of
the
audience
,
during
the
best
part
of
a
scene
in
which
the
author
has
represented
that
prince
as
an
object
of
abhorrence
.
<EOS>
I
have
observed
the
same
person
in
the
character
of
Hamlet
,
shake
his
fist
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
wrath
at
his
mistress
,
for
no
evident
cause
,
and
behave
like
a
ruffian
to
his
own
mother
.
<EOS>
Shocked
at
such
want
of
dignity
and
decorum
in
a
prince
,
who
seemed
the
favourite
of
the
people
,
I
condemned
the
genius
that
produced
him
,
but
,
upon
a
second
perusal
of
the
play
,
transferred
my
censure
to
the
actor
,
who
,
in
my
opinion
,
had
egregiously
mistaken
the
meaning
of
the
poet
.
<EOS>
At
a
juncture
,
when
his
whole
soul
ought
to
be
alarmed
with
terror
and
amazement
,
and
all
his
attention
engrossed
by
the
dreadful
object
in
view
,
I
mean
that
of
his
friend
whom
he
had
murthered
;
he
expresses
no
passion
but
that
of
indignation
against
a
drinking
glass
,
which
he
violently
dashes
in
pieces
on
the
floor
,
as
if
he
had
perceived
a
spider
in
his
wine
;
nay
,
while
his
eyes
are
fixed
upon
the
ground
,
he
starts
at
the
image
of
a
dagger
which
he
pretends
to
see
above
his
head
,
as
if
the
pavement
was
a
looking
-
glass
that
represented
it
by
reflexion
:
and
at
one
time
,
I
saw
him
walk
a
-
cross
the
stage
,
and
lend
an
inferior
character
a
box
on
the
ear
,
after
he
had
with
great
wrath
pronounced
<EOS>
"
Take
thou
that
,
"
or
some
equivalent
exclamation
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
scene
.
    
<EOS>
He
represents
the
grief
of
an
hero
,
by
the
tears
and
manner
of
a
whining
school
-
boy
,
and
perverts
the
genteel
deportment
of
a
gentleman
,
into
the
idle
buffoonery
of
a
miserable
tobacconist
;
his
whole
art
is
no
other
than
a
succession
of
frantic
vociferation
,
such
as
I
have
heard
in
the
cells
of
Bedlam
,
a
slowness
,
hesitation
and
oppression
of
speech
,
as
if
he
was
troubled
with
an
asthma
,
convulsive
startings
,
and
a
ductility
of
features
,
suited
to
the
most
extravagant
transitions
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
is
blessed
with
a
distinct
voice
,
and
a
great
share
of
vivacity
;
but
in
point
of
feeling
,
judgment
,
and
grace
,
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
altogether
defective
.
<EOS>
Not
to
mention
his
impropriety
in
dress
,
which
is
so
absurd
,
that
he
acts
the
part
of
a
youthful
prince
,
in
the
habit
of
an
undertaker
,
and
exhibits
the
gay
,
fashionable
Lothario
,
in
the
appearance
of
a
mountebank
.
<EOS>
I
beg
pardon
for
treating
this
darling
of
the
English
with
so
little
ceremony
;
and
to
convince
you
of
my
candour
,
frankly
confess
,
that
notwithstanding
all
I
have
said
,
he
is
qualified
to
make
a
considerable
figure
in
the
low
characters
of
humour
,
which
are
so
much
relished
by
a
London
audience
,
if
he
could
be
prevailed
upon
to
abate
of
that
monstrous
burlesque
,
which
is
an
outrage
against
nature
and
common
sense
.
<EOS>
As
for
his
competitor
in
fame
,
with
an
equal
share
of
capacity
,
he
is
inferior
to
him
in
personal
agility
,
sprightliness
and
voice
.
<EOS>
His
utterance
is
a
continual
sing
song
,
like
the
chanting
of
vespers
,
and
his
action
resembles
that
of
heaving
ballast
into
the
hold
of
a
ship
.
    
<EOS>
In
his
outward
deportment
,
he
seems
to
have
confounded
the
ideas
of
dignity
and
insolence
of
mien
,
acts
the
crafty
,
cool
,
designing
Crookback
,
as
a
loud
,
shallow
,
blustering
Hector
;
in
the
character
of
the
mild
patriot
Brutus
,
loses
all
temper
and
decorum
;
nay
,
so
ridiculous
is
the
behaviour
of
him
and
Cassius
at
their
interview
,
that
setting
foot
to
foot
,
and
grinning
at
each
other
,
with
the
aspect
of
two
coblers
enraged
,
they
thrust
their
left
sides
together
,
with
repeated
shocks
,
that
the
hilts
of
their
swords
may
clash
for
the
entertainment
of
the
audience
;
as
if
they
were
a
couple
of
Merry
Andrews
,
endeavouring
to
raise
the
laugh
of
the
vulgar
,
on
some
scaffold
at
Bartholomew
Fair
.
<EOS>
The
despair
of
a
great
man
who
falls
a
sacrifice
to
the
infernal
practices
of
a
subtle
traitor
,
that
enjoyed
his
confidence
,
this
English
Aesopus
represents
,
by
beating
his
own
forehead
,
and
bellowing
like
a
bull
;
and
indeed
,
in
almost
all
his
most
interesting
scenes
,
performs
such
strange
shakings
of
the
head
,
and
other
antic
gesticulations
,
that
when
I
first
saw
him
act
,
I
imagined
the
poor
man
laboured
under
that
paralytical
disorder
,
which
is
known
by
the
name
of
St
Vitus
's
dance
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
seems
to
be
a
stranger
to
the
more
refined
sensations
of
the
soul
,
consequently
his
expression
is
of
the
vulgar
kind
,
and
he
must
often
sink
under
the
idea
of
the
poet
;
so
that
he
has
recourse
to
such
violence
of
affected
agitation
,
as
imposes
upon
the
undiscerning
spectator
,
but
to
the
eye
of
taste
,
evinces
him
a
meer
player
of
that
class
whom
your
admired
Shakespear
justly
compares
to
nature
's
journeymen
tearing
a
passion
to
rags
.
    
<EOS>
Yet
this
man
,
in
spite
of
all
these
absurdities
,
is
an
admirable
Falstaff
,
exhibits
the
character
of
the
eighth
Henry
to
the
life
,
is
reasonably
applauded
in
the
Plain
Dealer
,
excels
in
the
part
of
Sir
John
Brute
,
and
would
be
equal
to
many
humorous
situations
in
low
comedy
,
which
his
pride
will
not
allow
him
to
undertake
.
<EOS>
I
should
not
have
been
so
severe
upon
these
rivals
,
had
not
I
seen
them
extolled
by
their
partizans
,
with
the
most
ridiculous
and
fulsome
manifestation
of
praise
,
even
in
those
very
circumstances
wherein
(
as
I
have
observed
)
<EOS>
they
chiefly

Pickle
,
not
a
little
piqued
to
hear
the
qualifications
of
the
two
most
celebrated
actors
in
England
treated
with
such
freedom
and
disrespect
,
answered
with
some
asperity
,
that
the
chevalier
was
a
true
critick
,
more
industrious
in
observing
the
blemishes
than
in
acknowledging
the
excellence
of
those
who
fell
under
his
examination
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
to
be
supposed
that
one
actor
could
shine
equally
in
all
characters
;
and
though
his
observations
were
undoubtedly
very
judicious
,
he
himself
could
not
help
wondering
that
some
of
them
had
always
escaped
his
notice
,
though
he
had
been
an
assiduous
frequenter
of
the
playhouse
.
<EOS>
"
The
two
players
in
question
,
said
he
,
have
,
in
your
own
opinion
,
a
considerable
share
of
merit
in
the
characters
of
comic
life
;
and
as
to
the
manners
of
the
great
personages
in
tragedy
,
and
the
operation
of
the
grand
passions
of
the
soul
<EOS>
,
I
apprehend
,
they
may
be
variously
represented
,
according
to
the
various
complexion
and
cultivation
of
different
men
.
    
<EOS>
A
Spaniard
,
for
example
,
though
impelled
by
the
same
passion
,
will
express
it
very
differently
from
a
Frenchman
;
and
what
is
looked
upon
as
graceful
vivacity
and
address
by
the
one
,
would
be
considered
as
impertinence
and
foppery
by
the
other
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
opposite
is
your
common
deportment
from
that
of
some
other
nations
,
that
one
of
your
own
countrymen
,
in
the
relation
of
his
travels
observes
,
that
the
Persians
even
of
this
age
,
when
they
see
any
man
perform
unnecessary
gestures
,
say
he
is
either
a
fool
or
a
Frenchman
.
<EOS>
The
standard
of
demeanour
being
thus
unsettled
,
a
Turk
,
a
Moor
,
an
Indian
,
or
inhabitant
of
any
country
,
whose
customs
and
dress
are
widely
different
from
ours
,
may
in
his
sentiments
,
possess
all
the
dignity
of
the
human
heart
,
and
be
inspired
by
the
noblest
passion
that
animates
the
soul
,
and
yet
excite
the
laughter
rather
than
the
respect
of
an
European
spectator
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
first
beheld
your
famous
Parisian
stage
-
heroine
,
in
one
of
her
principal
parts
,
her
attitudes
seemed
so
violent
,
and
she
tossed
her
arms
around
with
such
extravagance
,
that
she
put
me
in
mind
of
a
windmill
under
the
agitation
of
a
hard
gale
;
while
her
voice
and
features
exhibited
the
lively
representation
of
an
English
scold
.
<EOS>
The
action
of
your
favourite
male
-
performer
was
,
in
my
opinion
,
equally
unnatural
;
he
appeared
with
the
affected
airs
of
a
dancing
-
master
;
at
the
most
pathetic
junctures
of
his
fate
,
he
lifted
up
his
hands
above
his
head
,
like
a
tumbler
going
to
vault
,
and
spoke
as
if
his
throat
had
been
obstructed
by
an
hair
-
brush
;
yet
,
when
I
compared
their
manners
with
those
of
the
people
before
whom
they
performed
,
and
made
allowance
for
that
exaggeration
which
obtains
on
all
theatres
,
I
was
insensibly
reconciled
to
their
method
of
performance
,
and
could
distinguish
abundance
of
merit
beneath
that
oddity
of
appearance
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
chevalier
perceiving
Peregrine
a
little
irritated
at
what
he
had
said
,
asked
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
,
in
censuring
the
English
players
,
assuring
him
that
he
had
an
infinite
veneration
for
the
British
learning
,
genius
and
taste
,
which
were
so
justly
distinguished
in
the
world
of
letters
;
and
that
notwithstanding
the
severity
of
his
criticism
,
he
thought
the
theatre
of
London
much
better
supplied
with
actors
than
that
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
thanked
him
for
his
polite
condescension
,
at
which
Pallet
exulted
,
saying
with
a
shake
of
the
head
,
"
I
believe
so
too
,
Monsieur
;
"
and
the
physician
,
impatient
of
the
dispute
in
which
he
had
bore
no
share
,
observed
with
a
supercilious
air
,
that
the
modern
stage
was
altogether
beneath
the
notice
of
one
who
had
an
idea
of
ancient
magnificence
and
execution
;
that
plays
ought
to
be
exhibited
at
the
expence
of
the
state
,
as
those
of
Sophocles
were
by
the
Athenians
;
and
that
proper
judges
should
be
appointed
for
receiving
or
rejecting
all
such
performances
as
are
offered
to
the
public
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
described
the
theatre
at
Rome
,
which
contained
eighty
thousand
spectators
,
gave
them
a
learned
disquisition
into
the
nature
of
the
Persona
,
or
mask
,
worn
by
the
Roman
actors
,
which
,
he
said
,
was
a
machine
that
covered
the
whole
head
,
furnished
on
the
inside
with
a
brazen
concavity
,
that
,
by
reverberating
the
sound
as
it
issued
from
the
mouth
,
raised
the
voice
,
so
as
to
render
it
audible
to
such
an
extended
audience
.
    
<EOS>
He
explained
the
difference
between
the
Saltator
and
Declamator
,
one
of
whom
acted
,
while
the
other
rehearsed
the
part
;
and
from
thence
took
occasion
to
mention
the
perfection
of
their
pantomimes
,
who
were
so
amazingly
distinct
in
the
exercise
of
their
art
,
that
a
certain
prince
of
Pontus
being
at
the
court
of
Nero
,
and
seeing
one
of
them
represent
a
story
,
begged
him
of
the
emperor
,
in
order
to
employ
him
as
an
interpreter
among
barbarous
nations
,
whose
language
he
did
not
understand
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
divers
cynic
philosophers
,
who
had
condemned
this
entertainment
unseen
,
when
they
chanced
to
be
eye
-
witnesses
of
their
admirable
dexterity
,
expressed
their
sorrow
for
having
so
long
debarred
themselves
of
such
rational
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
He
dissented
,
however
,
from
the
opinion
of
Peregrine
,
who
,
as
a
proof
of
their
excellence
,
had
advanced
,
that
some
of
the
English
actors
fancied
themselves
the
very
thing
they
represented
,
and
recounted
a
story
from
Lucian
,
of
a
certain
celebrated
pantomime
,
who
in
acting
the
part
of
Ajax
in
his
frenzy
,
was
transported
into
a
real
fit
of
delirium
,
during
which
he
tore
to
-
pieces
the
cloaths
of
that
actor
who
stalked
before
him
,
beating
the
stage
with
iron
shoes
,
in
order
to
increase
the
noise
,
snatched
an
instrument
from
one
of
the
musicians
,
and
broke
it
over
the
head
of
him
who
represented
Ulysses
;
and
running
to
the
consular
bench
,
mistook
a
couple
of
senators
for
the
sheep
which
were
to
be
slain
.
<EOS>
The
audience
applauded
him
to
the
skies
;
but
so
conscious
was
the
mimic
of
his
own
extravagance
,
when
he
recovered
the
use
of
his
reason
,
that
he
actually
fell
sick
with
mortification
;
and
being
afterwards
desired
to
re
-
act
the
piece
,
flatly
refused
to
appear
in
any
such
character
,
saying
,
that
the
shortest
follies
were
the
best
,
and
that
it
was
sufficient
for
him
to
have
been
a
madman
once
in
his
life
.

Chapter
LVI
   
<EOS>
The
doctor
being
fairly
engaged
on
the
subject
of
the
ancients
,
would
have
proceeded
the
Lord
knows
how
far
,
without
hesitation
,
had
not
he
been
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Jolter
,
who
in
great
confusion
told
them
,
that
Pipes
having
affronted
a
soldier
,
was
then
surrounded
in
the
street
,
and
would
certainly
be
put
to
death
,
if
some
person
of
authority
did
not
immediately
interpose
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
no
sooner
<EOS>
learn'd
<EOS>
the
danger
of
his
trusty
squire
,
than
snatching
up
his
sword
,
he
ran
down
stairs
,
and
was
followed
by
the
Chevalier
,
intreating
him
to
leave
the
affair
to
his
management
.
<EOS>
Within
ten
yards
of
the
door
they
found
Tom
with
his
back
to
a
wall
,
defending
himself
manfully
with
a
mopstick
against
the
assault
of
three
or
four
soldiers
,
who
at
sight
of
the
Maltese
cross
desisted
from
the
attack
,
and
were
taken
into
custody
by
order
of
the
knight
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
aggressors
being
an
Irishman
,
begged
to
be
heard
with
great
importunity
,
before
he
should
be
sent
to
the
guard
;
and
by
the
mediation
of
Pickle
,
was
accordingly
brought
into
the
Hotel
,
with
his
companions
,
all
three
bearing
upon
their
heads
and
faces
evident
marks
of
their
adversary
's
prowess
and
dexterity
.
    
<EOS>
The
spokesman
being
confronted
with
Pipes
,
informed
the
company
,
that
having
by
accident
met
with
Mr
Pipes
,
whom
he
considered
as
his
countryman
,
though
fortune
had
disposed
of
them
in
different
services
,
he
invited
him
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
;
and
accordingly
carried
him
to
a
Cabaret
,
where
he
introduced
him
to
his
comrades
;
but
in
the
course
of
the
conversation
,
which
turned
upon
the
power
and
greatness
of
the
kings
of
France
and
England
,
Mr
Pipes
had
been
pleased
to
treat
his
Most
Christian
Majesty
with
great
disrespect
;
and
when
he
(
the
entertainer
)
expostulated
with
him
in
a
friendly
manner
about
his
impolite
behaviour
,
observing
,
that
he
being
in
the
French
service
,
would
be
under
the
necessity
of
resenting
his
abuse
,
if
he
did
not
put
a
stop
to
it
before
the
other
gentlemen
of
the
cloth
should
comprehend
his
meaning
,
he
had
set
them
all
three
at
defiance
,
dishonoured
him
in
particular
with
the
opprobrious
epithet
of
rebel
to
his
native
king
and
country
,
and
even
drank
(
in
broken
French
)
to
the
perdition
of
Lewis
and
all
his
adherents
!
<EOS>
that
compelled
by
this
outragious
conduct
,
he
,
as
the
person
who
had
recommended
him
to
their
society
,
had
,
in
vindication
of
his
own
character
,
demanded
satisfaction
of
the
delinquent
,
who
on
pretence
of
fetching
a
sword
,
had
gone
to
his
lodging
,
from
whence
he
all
of
a
sudden
sallied
upon
them
with
the
mopstick
,
which
he
employed
in
the
annoyance
of
them
all
without
distinction
,
so
that
they
were
obliged
to
draw
in
their
own
defence
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
being
questioned
by
his
master
,
with
regard
to
the
truth
of
this
account
,
owned
that
every
circumstance
was
justly
represented
;
saying
,
he
did
not
value
their
cheese
-
toasters
a
pinch
of
oakum
;
and
that
if
the
gentlemen
had
not
shot
in
betwixt
them
,
he
would
have
trimmed
them
to
such
a
tune
,
that
they
should
not
have
had
a
whole
yard
to
square
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
reprimanded
him
sharply
for
his
unmannerly
behaviour
,
and
insisted
upon
his
asking
pardon
of
those
he
had
injured
,
upon
the
spot
.
<EOS>
But
no
consideration
was
efficacious
enough
to
produce
such
concession
;
to
this
command
he
was
both
deaf
and
dumb
,
and
the
repeated
threats
of
his
master
had
no
more
effect
than
if
they
had
been
addressed
to
a
marble
statue
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
our
hero
incensed
at
his
obstinacy
,
started
up
,
and
would
have
chastised
him
with
manual
operation
,
had
not
he
been
prevented
by
the
Chevalier
,
who
found
means
to
moderate
his
indignation
so
far
,
that
he
contented
himself
with
dismissing
the
offender
from
his
service
;
and
after
having
obtained
the
discharge
of
the
prisoners
,
gave
them
a
Louis
to
drink
,
by
way
of
recompence
for
the
disgrace
and
damage
they
had
sustained
.
    
<EOS>
The
Knight
perceiving
our
young
gentleman
very
much
ruffled
at
this
accident
,
and
reflecting
upon
the
extraordinary
deportment
and
appearance
of
his
valet
,
whose
hair
had
by
this
time
adopted
a
grizzled
hue
,
imagined
he
was
some
favourite
domestic
,
who
had
grown
grey
in
the
service
of
his
master
's
family
,
and
that
,
of
consequence
,
he
was
uneasy
at
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
.
<EOS>
Swayed
by
this
conjecture
,
he
earnestly
sollicited
in
his
behalf
;
but
all
he
could
obtain
,
was
a
promise
of
re
-
admitting
him
into
favour
on
the
terms
already
proposed
,
or
at
least
on
condition
that
he
should
make
his
acknowledgment
to
the
Chevalier
,
for
his
want
of
reverence
and
respect
for
the
French
monarch
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
this
condescension
,
the
culprit
was
called
up
stairs
,
and
made
acquainted
with
the
mitigation
of
his
fate
;
upon
which
he
said
,
he
would
down
on
his
marrow
-
bones
to
his
own
master
,
but
would
be
damn'd
before
he
would
ask
pardon
of
e'er
a
Frenchman
in
Christendom
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
exasperated
at
this
blunt
declaration
,
ordered
him
out
of
his
presence
,
and
charged
him
never
to
appear
before
his
face
again
;
while
the
officer
in
vain
employed
all
his
influence
and
address
to
appease
his
resentment
,
and
about
midnight
took
his
leave
,
with
marks
of
mortification
at
his
want
of
success
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
the
company
agreed
to
travel
through
Flanders
in
the
Diligence
,
by
the
advice
of
Peregrine
,
who
was
not
without
hope
of
meeting
with
some
adventure
or
amusement
in
that
carriage
;
and
Jolter
took
care
to
secure
places
for
them
all
<EOS>
,
it
being
resolved
that
the
valet
de
chamber
and
the
doctor
's
man
should
attend
the
vehicle
on
horseback
;
and
as
for
the
forlorn
Pipes
,
he
was
left
to
reap
the
fruits
of
his
own
stubborn
disposition
,
notwithstanding
the
united
efforts
of
the
whole
triumvirate
,
who
endeavoured
to
procure
his
pardon
.
    
<EOS>
Every
previous
measure
being
thus
taken
,
they
set
out
from
Lisle
about
six
in
the
morning
,
and
found
themselves
in
the
company
of
a
female
adventurer
,
a
very
handsome
young
lady
,
a
Capuchin
,
and
a
Rotterdam
Jew
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
being
the
first
of
this
society
that
entered
,
surveyed
the
strangers
with
an
attentive
eye
,
and
seated
himself
immediately
behind
the
beautiful
unknown
,
who
at
once
attracted
his
attention
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
seeing
another
lady
uninengaged
,
in
imitation
of
his
friend
,
took
possession
of
her
neighbourhood
;
the
physician
paired
with
the
priest
,
and
Jolter
sat
down
by
the
Jew
.
    
<EOS>
The
machine
had
not
proceeded
many
furlongs
,
when
Pickle
accosting
the
fair
incognita
,
congratulated
himself
upon
his
happiness
,
in
being
the
fellow
-
traveller
of
so
charming
a
lady
.
<EOS>
She
,
without
the
least
reserve
or
affectation
,
thanked
him
for
his
compliment
,
and
replied
with
a
sprightly
air
,
that
now
they
were
embarked
in
one
common
bottom
,
they
must
club
their
endeavours
to
make
one
another
as
happy
as
the
nature
of
their
situation
would
permit
them
to
be
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
frank
intimation
,
and
captivated
by
her
fine
black
eyes
and
easy
behaviour
,
he
attached
himself
to
her
from
that
moment
;
and
in
a
little
time
the
conversation
became
so
particular
,
that
the
Capuchin
thought
proper
to
interfere
in
the
discourse
,
in
such
a
manner
as
gave
the
youth
to
understand
,
that
he
was
there
on
purpose
to
superintend
her
conduct
.
<EOS>
He
was
doubly
rejoiced
at
this
discovery
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
hoped
to
profit
in
his
addresses
,
not
only
by
the
young
lady
's
restraint
,
that
never
fails
to
operate
in
behalf
of
the
lover
,
but
also
by
the
corruptibility
of
her
guardian
,
whom
he
did
not
doubt
of
rendering
propitious
to
his
cause
.
    
<EOS>
Flushed
with
these
expectations
,
he
behaved
with
uncommon
complacency
to
the
father
,
who
was
charmed
with
the
affability
of
his
carriage
,
and
on
the
faith
of
his
generosity
abated
of
his
vigilance
so
much
,
that
our
hero
carried
on
his
suit
without
further
molestation
;
while
the
painter
,
in
signs
and
loud
bursts
of
laughter
,
conversed
with
his
Dulcinea
,
who
was
perfectly
well
versed
in
these
simple
expressions
of
satisfaction
,
and
had
already
found
means
to
make
a
dangerous
invasion
upon
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
were
the
governor
and
physician
unemployed
,
while
their
friends
interested
themselves
in
this
agreeable
manner
.
<EOS>
Jolter
no
sooner
perceived
the
Hollander
was
a
Jew
,
than
he
entered
into
an
investigation
of
the
Hebrew
tongue
,
in
which
he
was
a
connoisseur
;
and
the
doctor
at
the
same
time
attacked
the
Mendicant
on
the
ridiculous
maxims
of
his
order
,
together
with
the
impositions
of
priest
-
craft
in
general
,
which
(
he
observed
)
prevail
so
much
among
those
who
profess
the
Roman
Catholic
religion
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
coupled
,
each
committee
enjoyed
their
own
conversation
apart
,
without
any
danger
of
encroachment
;
and
all
were
so
intent
upon
their
several
topics
,
that
they
scarce
allowed
themselves
a
small
interval
in
viewing
the
desolation
of
Menin
,
as
they
passed
through
that
ruined
frontier
.
<EOS>
About
twelve
o'clock
they
arrived
at
Courtray
,
where
the
horses
are
always
,
changed
,
and
the
company
halt
an
hour
for
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Here
Peregrine
handed
his
charmer
into
an
apartment
,
where
she
was
joined
by
the
other
lady
;
and
on
pretence
of
seeing
some
of
the
churches
in
town
,
put
himself
under
the
direction
of
the
Capuchin
,
from
whom
he
learn'd
,
that
the
young
lady
was
wife
to
a
French
gentleman
,
to
whom
she
had
been
married
about
a
year
,
and
that
she
was
now
on
her
journey
to
visit
her
mother
,
who
lived
in
Brussels
,
and
who
at
that
time
laboured
under
a
lingering
distemper
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
would
soon
put
a
period
to
her
life
.
    
<EOS>
He
then
launched
out
in
praise
of
her
daughter
's
virtue
and
conjugal
affection
;
and
lastly
told
him
,
that
he
was
her
father
confessor
,
and
pitched
upon
to
be
her
conductor
through
Flanders
,
by
her
husband
,
who
,
as
well
as
his
wife
,
placed
the
utmost
confidence
in
his
prudence
and
integrity
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
easily
comprehended
the
meaning
of
this
insinuation
,
and
took
the
hint
accordingly
.
<EOS>
He
tickled
the
priest
's
vanity
with
extraordinary
encomiums
upon
the
disinterested
principles
of
his
order
,
which
were
detached
from
all
worldly
pursuits
,
and
altogether
devoted
to
the
eternal
salvation
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
He
applauded
their
patience
,
humility
and
learning
,
and
lavished
a
world
of
praise
upon
their
talent
in
preaching
,
which
(
he
said
)
had
more
than
once
operated
so
powerfully
upon
him
,
that
had
he
not
been
restrained
by
certain
considerations
which
he
could
not
possibly
wave
,
he
should
have
embraced
their
tenets
,
and
begg'd
admission
into
their
fraternity
;
but
,
as
the
circumstances
of
his
fate
would
not
permit
him
to
take
such
a
salutary
measure
for
the
present
,
he
intreated
the
good
father
to
accept
a
small
token
of
his
love
and
respect
,
for
the
benefit
of
that
convent
to
which
he
belonged
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
pulled
out
a
purse
of
ten
guineas
,
which
the
Capuchin
observing
,
turned
his
head
another
way
,
and
lifting
up
his
arm
,
displayed
a
pocket
almost
as
high
as
his
collar
-
bone
,
in
which
he
deposited
the
money
.
    
<EOS>
This
proof
of
affection
for
the
order
produced
a
sudden
and
surprising
effect
upon
the
friar
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
transport
of
his
zeal
he
wrung
this
semi
-
convert
's
hand
,
showered
a
thousand
benedictions
upon
his
head
,
and
exhorted
him
,
with
the
tears
flowing
from
his
eyes
,
to
perfect
the
great
work
which
the
finger
of
God
had
begun
in
his
heart
;
and
as
an
instance
of
his
concern
for
the
welfare
of
his
precious
soul
,
the
holy
brother
promised
to
recommend
him
strenuously
to
the
pious
admonitions
of
the
young
woman
under
his
care
,
who
was
a
perfect
saint
upon
earth
,
and
endued
with
the
peculiar
gift
of
mollifying
the
hearts
of
obdurate
sinners
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
O
father
!
<EOS>
(
cried
the
hypocritical
projector
,
who
by
this
time
perceived
that
his
money
was
not
thrown
away
)
if
I
could
be
favoured
but
for
one
half
hour
with
the
private
instructions
of
that
inspired
devotee
,
my
mind
presages
,
that
I
should
be
a
stray'd
sheep
brought
back
into
the
fold
,
and
that
I
should
find
easy
entrance
at
the
gates
of
heaven
!
<EOS>
There
is
something
supernatural
in
her
aspect
;
I
gaze
upon
her
with
the
most
pious
fervor
,
and
my
whole
soul
is
agitated
with
tumults
of
hope
and
despair
!
"
<EOS>
Having
pronounced
this
rhapsody
with
transport
half
natural
and
half
affected
,
the
priest
assured
him
,
that
these
were
operations
of
the
spirit
,
which
must
not
be
repressed
;
and
comforted
him
with
the
hope
of
enjoying
the
blessed
interview
which
he
desired
,
protesting
,
that
as
far
as
his
influence
extended
,
his
wish
should
be
that
very
evening
indulged
.
<EOS>
The
gracious
pupil
thanked
him
for
his
benevolent
concern
,
which
he
swore
should
not
be
squandered
upon
an
ungrateful
object
;
and
the
rest
of
the
company
interrupting
the
conversation
,
they
returned
in
a
body
to
the
inn
,
where
they
dined
all
together
;
and
the
ladies
were
persuaded
to
be
our
hero
's
guests
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
subjects
on
which
they
had
been
engaged
before
dinner
were
not
exhausted
,
each
brace
resumed
their
former
theme
,
when
they
were
replaced
in
the
Diligence
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
's
mistress
finished
her
conquest
,
by
exerting
her
skill
in
the
art
of
ogling
,
accompanied
by
frequent
bewitching
sighs
,
and
some
tender
French
songs
that
she
sung
with
such
pathetic
expression
,
as
quite
melted
the
resolution
of
Pallet
,
and
utterly
subdued
his
affection
:
and
he
,
to
convince
her
of
the
importance
of
her
victory
,
gave
a
specimen
of
his
own
talents
,
by
entertaining
her
with
that
celebrated
English
ditty
,
the
burthen
of
which
begins
with
,
The
pigs
they
lie
with
their
arses
bare
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LVII
<EOS>
He
makes
some
progress
in
her
affections
;
is
interrupted
by
a
dispute
between
Jolter
and
a
Jew
;
appeases
the
wrath
of
the
Capuchin
,
who
procures
for
him
an
interview
with
his
fair
enslaver
,
in
which
he
finds
himself
deceived
.
   
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
mean
while
,
employed
all
his
insinuation
and
address
in
practising
upon
the
heart
of
the
Capuchin
's
fair
charge
.
<EOS>
He
had
long
ago
declared
his
passion
,
not
in
the
superficial
manner
of
a
French
gallant
,
but
with
all
the
ardor
of
an
enthusiast
.
<EOS>
He
had
languished
,
vow'd
,
flattered
,
<EOS>
kiss'd
<EOS>
her
hand
by
stealth
,
and
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
his
reception
.
    
<EOS>
Though
by
a
man
of
a
less
sanguine
disposition
,
her
particular
complaisance
would
have
been
deemed
equivocal
,
and
perhaps
nothing
more
than
the
effect
of
French
breeding
and
constitutional
vivacity
;
he
gave
his
own
qualifications
credit
for
the
whole
,
and
with
these
sentiments
carried
on
the
attack
with
such
unabating
vigour
,
that
she
was
actually
prevailed
upon
to
accept
a
ring
,
which
he
presented
as
a
token
of
his
esteem
;
and
every
thing
proceeded
in
a
most
prosperous
train
,
when
they
were
disturbed
by
the
governor
and
Israelite
,
who
in
the
heat
of
disputation
raised
their
voices
,
and
poured
forth
such
effusions
of
gutturals
,
as
set
our
lover
's
teeth
on
edge
.
<EOS>
As
they
spoke
in
a
language
unknown
to
every
one
in
the
carriage
but
themselves
,
and
looked
at
each
other
with
mutual
animosity
and
rancour
,
Peregrine
desired
to
know
the
cause
of
their
contention
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
Jolter
exclaimed
in
a
furious
tone
,
"
This
learned
Levite
,
forsooth
,
has
the
impudence
to
tell
me
,
that
I
do
n't
understand
Hebrew
;
and
affirms
,
that
the
word
Benoni
signifies
child
of
joy
;
whereas
I
can
prove
,
and
indeed
have
already
said
enough
to
convince
any
reasonable
man
,
that
in
the
Septuagint
it
is
rightly
translated
into
son
of
my
sorrow
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
explained
himself
to
his
pupil
,
he
turned
to
the
priest
,
with
intention
to
appeal
to
his
determination
;
but
the
Jew
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
with
great
eagerness
,
saying
,
"
For
the
love
of
God
be
quiet
,
the
Capuchin
will
discover
who
we
are
!
"
<EOS>
Jolter
,
offended
at
this
conjunction
,
ecchoed
"
Who
we
are
!
"
<EOS>
with
great
emphasis
;
and
repeating
nos
poma
natamus
,
asked
ironically
,
to
which
of
the
Tribes
<EOS>
the
Jew
thought
he
belonged
?
<EOS>
The
Levite
,
affronted
at
his
comparing
him
to
a
ball
of
horse
-
dung
,
replied
with
a
most
significant
grin
,
"
To
the
tribe
of
Issachar
.
"
    
<EOS>
And
his
antagonist
,
taking
the
advantage
of
his
unwillingness
to
be
known
by
the
friar
,
and
prompted
by
revenge
for
the
freedom
he
had
used
,
answered
in
the
French
language
,
that
the
judgment
of
God
was
still
manifest
upon
their
whole
race
,
not
only
in
their
being
in
the
state
of
exiles
from
their
native
land
,
but
also
in
the
spite
of
their
hearts
and
pravity
of
their
dispositions
,
which
demonstrate
them
to
be
the
genuine
offspring
of
those
who
crucified
the
Saviour
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
His
expectation
was
,
however
,
defeated
;
the
priest
himself
was
too
deeply
engaged
,
to
attend
to
the
debates
of
other
people
.
<EOS>
The
physician
,
in
the
pride
and
insolence
of
his
learning
,
had
undertaken
to
display
the
absurdity
of
the
Christian
faith
;
having
already
(
as
he
thought
)
confuted
the
Capuchin
,
touching
the
points
of
belief
in
which
the
Roman
Catholics
differ
from
the
rest
of
the
world
.
<EOS>
But
,
not
contented
with
the
imagined
victory
he
had
gained
,
he
began
to
strike
at
the
fundamentals
of
religion
;
and
the
father
,
with
incredible
forbearance
,
suffered
him
to
make
very
free
with
the
doctrine
of
the
Trinity
:
but
,
when
he
levelled
the
shafts
of
his
ridicule
at
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
the
good
man
's
patience
forsook
him
,
his
eyes
seemed
to
kindle
with
indignation
,
he
trembled
in
every
joint
,
and
uttered
with
a
loud
voice
,
"
You
are
an
abominable
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
call
thee
heretic
,
for
thou
art
worse
(
if
possible
)
than
a
Jew
;
you
deserve
to
be
inclosed
in
a
furnace
seven
times
heated
,
and
I
have
a
good
mind
to
lodge
an
information
against
you
with
the
governor
of
Ghent
,
that
you
may
be
apprehended
and
punished
as
an
impious
blasphemer
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
This
menace
operated
like
a
charm
upon
all
present
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
was
confounded
,
the
governor
dismayed
,
the
Levite
's
teeth
chattered
,
the
painter
was
astonished
at
the
general
confusion
,
the
cause
of
which
he
could
not
comprehend
;
and
Pickle
himself
,
not
a
little
alarmed
,
was
obliged
to
use
all
his
interest
and
assiduity
in
appeasing
this
son
of
the
church
,
who
at
length
,
in
consideration
of
the
friendship
he
professed
for
the
young
gentleman
,
consented
to
forgive
what
had
passed
,
but
absolutely
refused
to
sit
in
contact
with
such
a
profane
wretch
,
whom
he
looked
upon
as
a
fiend
of
darkness
,
sent
by
the
enemy
of
mankind
to
poison
the
minds
of
weak
people
;
so
that
,
after
having
crossed
himself
,
and
muttered
certain
exorcisms
,
he
insisted
upon
the
doctor
's
changing
places
with
the
Jew
,
who
approached
the
offended
ecclesiastic
in
an
agony
of
fear
.
    
<EOS>
Matters
being
thus
compromised
,
the
conversation
flowed
in
a
more
general
channel
;
and
without
the
intervention
of
any
other
accident
,
or
bone
of
contention
,
the
carriage
arrived
at
the
city
of
Ghent
about
seven
in
the
evening
;
and
supper
being
bespoke
for
the
whole
company
,
our
adventurer
and
his
friends
went
out
to
take
a
superficial
view
of
the
place
,
leaving
his
new
mistress
to
the
pious
exhortations
of
her
confessor
,
whom
(
as
we
have
already
observed
)
<EOS>
he
had
secured
in
his
interest
.
<EOS>
This
zealous
mediator
spoke
so
warmly
in
his
commendation
,
and
interested
her
conscience
so
much
in
the
affair
,
that
she
could
not
refuse
her
helping
hand
to
the
great
work
of
his
conversion
,
and
promised
to
grant
the
interview
he
desired
.
    
<EOS>
This
agreeable
piece
of
intelligence
,
which
the
Capuchin
communicated
to
Peregrine
at
his
return
,
elevated
his
spirits
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
shone
at
supper
with
uncommon
brilliance
,
in
a
thousand
sallies
of
wit
and
pleasantry
,
to
the
admiration
and
delight
of
all
present
,
especially
of
his
fair
Fleming
,
who
seemed
quite
captivated
by
his
person
and
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
The
evening
being
thus
spent
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
parties
,
the
company
broke
up
,
and
retired
to
their
several
apartments
,
when
our
lover
,
to
his
unspeakable
mortification
,
learnt
that
the
two
ladies
were
obliged
to
lie
in
the
same
room
,
all
the
other
chambers
of
the
inn
being
preoccupied
.
<EOS>
When
he
imparted
this
difficulty
to
the
priest
,
that
charitable
father
,
who
was
very
fruitful
in
expedients
,
assured
him
,
that
his
spiritual
concerns
should
not
be
obstructed
by
such
a
slender
impediment
;
and
accordingly
availed
himself
of
his
prerogative
,
by
going
into
his
daughter
's
chamber
when
she
was
almost
undressed
,
and
leading
her
into
his
own
,
on
pretence
of
administring
salutary
food
for
her
soul
.
<EOS>
Having
brought
the
two
votaries
together
,
he
prayed
for
success
to
the
operations
of
grace
,
and
left
them
to
their
mutual
meditations
,
after
having
conjured
them
in
the
most
solemn
manner
to
let
no
impure
sentiments
,
or
temptations
of
the
flesh
,
interfere
with
the
hallowed
design
of
their
meeting
.
    
<EOS>
The
reverend
intercessor
being
gone
,
and
the
door
fastened
on
the
inside
,
the
pseudo
-
convert
,
transported
with
his
passion
,
threw
himself
at
his
Amanda
's
feet
;
and
begging
she
would
spare
him
the
tedious
form
of
addresses
,
which
the
nature
of
their
interview
would
not
permit
him
to
observe
,
began
with
all
the
impetuosity
of
love
to
profit
by
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
,
whether
she
was
displeased
at
the
intrepidity
and
assurance
of
his
behaviour
,
thinking
herself
intitled
to
more
courtship
and
respect
,
or
was
really
better
fortified
with
chastity
than
he
or
his
procurer
had
supposed
her
to
be
;
certain
it
is
,
she
expressed
resentment
and
surprize
at
his
boldness
and
presumption
,
and
upbraided
him
with
having
imposed
upon
the
charity
of
the
friar
.
    
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
really
as
much
astonished
at
this
rebuff
,
as
she
pretended
to
be
at
his
declaration
,
and
earnestly
intreated
her
to
consider
how
precious
the
moments
were
,
and
for
once
sacrifice
superfluous
ceremony
,
to
the
happiness
of
one
who
adored
her
with
such
a
flame
,
as
could
not
fail
to
consume
his
vitals
,
if
she
would
not
deign
to
bless
him
with
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
notwithstanding
all
his
tears
,
vows
and
supplications
,
his
personal
accomplishments
and
the
tempting
opportunity
,
all
that
he
could
obtain
,
was
an
acknowledgment
of
his
having
made
an
impression
upon
her
heart
,
which
she
hoped
the
dictates
of
her
duty
would
enable
her
to
erase
.
<EOS>
This
confession
he
considered
as
a
delicate
consent
;
and
obeying
the
impulse
of
his
love
,
snatched
her
up
in
his
arms
,
with
intention
of
seizing
that
which
she
declined
to
give
;
when
this
French
Lucretia
,
unable
to
defend
her
virtue
any
other
way
,
screamed
aloud
;
and
the
Capuchin
,
setting
his
shoulder
to
the
door
,
burst
it
open
,
and
entered
in
an
affected
extasy
of
amazement
.
<EOS>
He
lifted
up
his
hands
and
eyes
,
and
pretended
to
be
thunderstruck
at
the
discovery
he
had
made
;
then
,
in
broken
exclamations
,
professed
his
horror
at
the
wicked
intention
of
our
hero
,
who
had
covered
such
a
damnable
scheme
with
the
mask
of
religion
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
performed
his
cue
with
such
dexterity
,
that
the
lady
believing
him
in
earnest
,
begg'd
he
would
forgive
the
stranger
,
on
account
of
his
youth
and
education
,
which
had
been
tainted
by
the
errors
of
heresy
;
and
he
was
on
these
considerations
content
to
accept
the
submission
of
our
hero
,
who
,
far
from
renouncing
his
expectations
,
notwithstanding
this
mortifying
repulse
,
confided
so
much
in
his
own
talents
,
and
the
confession
which
his
mistress
had
made
,
that
he
resolved
to
make
another
effort
,
to
which
nothing
could
have
prompted
him
but
the
utmost
turbulence
of
unruly
desire
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LVIII
<EOS>
He
makes
another
effort
towards
the
accomplishment
of
his
wish
,
which
is
postponed
by
a
strange
accident
.
   
<EOS>
He
directed
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
was
a
thorough
-
paced
pimp
,
to
kindle
some
straw
in
the
yard
,
and
then
pass
by
the
door
of
her
apartment
,
crying
with
a
loud
voice
that
the
house
was
on
fire
.
<EOS>
This
alarm
brought
both
ladies
out
of
their
chamber
in
a
moment
,
and
Peregrine
taking
the
advantage
of
their
running
to
the
street
door
,
entered
the
room
and
concealed
himself
under
a
large
table
that
stood
in
an
unobserved
corner
.
<EOS>
The
nymphs
,
as
soon
as
they
understood
the
cause
of
his
Mercury
's
supposed
affright
,
returned
to
their
apartment
,
and
having
said
their
prayers
,
undressed
themselves
and
went
to
bed
.
<EOS>
This
scene
,
which
fell
under
the
observation
of
Pickle
,
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
cooling
of
his
concupiscence
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
inflamed
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
scarce
restrain
his
impatience
,
until
by
her
snoring
,
he
concluded
the
fellow
-
lodger
of
his
Amanda
was
asleep
.
<EOS>
This
welcome
note
no
sooner
saluted
his
ears
,
than
he
crept
to
his
charmer
's
bedside
,
and
placing
himself
on
his
knees
,
gently
laid
hold
on
her
white
hand
,
and
pressed
it
to
his
lips
.
    
<EOS>
She
had
just
begun
to
close
her
eyes
,
and
enjoy
the
agreeable
oppression
of
slumber
,
when
she
was
roused
by
this
rape
,
at
which
she
started
,
pronouncing
in
a
tone
of
surprize
and
dismay
,
"
My
God
!
<EOS>
who
's
that
?
"
<EOS>
The
lover
,
with
the
most
insinuating
humility
,
besought
her
to
hear
him
;
vowing
that
his
intention
in
approaching
her
thus
,
was
not
to
violate
the
laws
of
decency
,
or
that
indelible
esteem
which
she
had
engraven
on
his
heart
;
but
to
manifest
his
sorrow
and
contrition
for
the
umbrage
he
had
given
,
to
pour
forth
the
overflowings
of
his
soul
,
and
tell
her
that
he
neither
could
nor
would
survive
her
displeasure
.
<EOS>
These
and
many
more
pathetic
protestations
,
accompanied
with
sighs
and
tears
,
and
other
expressions
of
genuine
grief
,
which
our
hero
had
at
command
,
could
not
fail
to
melt
the
tender
heart
of
the
amiable
Fleming
,
already
prepossessed
in
favour
of
his
qualifications
.
<EOS>
She
sympathized
so
much
with
his
affliction
,
as
to
weep
in
her
turn
,
when
she
represented
the
impossibility
of
her
rewarding
his
passion
;
and
he
seizing
the
favourable
moment
,
reinforced
his
sollicitations
with
such
irresistible
transports
,
that
her
resolution
gave
way
,
she
began
to
breathe
quick
and
deep
,
expressed
her
fear
of
being
overheard
by
the
other
lady
,
and
with
an
ejaculation
of
"
O
heavens
!
<EOS>
I
'm
undone
:
"
suffered
herself
,
after
a
faint
struggle
,
to
be
overpowered
by
her
admirer
,
who
made
a
lodgment
upon
the
covered
way
of
her
bed
,
under
the
curtain
of
the
counterscarp
;
and
in
all
probability
,
would
have
in
a
few
moments
made
himself
master
of
the
place
;
when
her
honour
was
secured
for
the
present
,
by
a
strange
sort
of
knocking
upon
the
wainscot
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
hard
by
the
bed
in
which
the
female
adventurer
lay
.
    
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
circumstance
which
interrupted
our
assailant
's
operations
,
the
lady
begged
him
for
heaven
's
sake
to
retreat
,
else
her
reputation
would
be
ruined
for
ever
:
but
when
he
represented
to
her
,
that
her
character
would
run
a
much
greater
risk
,
if
he
should
be
detected
in
withdrawing
,
she
consented
with
great
trepidation
to
his
stay
,
and
they
listened
in
silence
to
the
sequel
of
the
noise
that
alarmed
them
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
other
than
an
expedient
of
the
painter
,
to
awaken
his
Dulcinea
,
with
whom
he
had
made
an
assignation
,
or
at
least
interchanged
such
signals
as
he
thought
amounted
to
a
firm
appointment
.
<EOS>
His
nymph
being
disturbed
in
her
first
fleep
,
immediately
understood
the
sound
,
and
true
to
the
agreement
,
rose
,
and
unbolting
the
door
as
softly
as
possible
,
gave
him
admittance
,
leaving
it
open
for
his
more
commodious
retreat
.
    
<EOS>
While
this
happy
gallant
was
employed
in
disengaging
himself
from
the
dishabille
in
which
he
had
entered
,
the
Capuchin
suspecting
that
Peregrine
would
make
another
attempt
upon
his
charge
,
had
crept
silently
to
the
apartment
,
in
order
to
reconnoitre
,
lest
the
adventure
should
be
atchieved
without
his
knowledge
;
a
circumstance
that
would
deprive
him
of
the
profits
he
might
expect
from
his
privity
and
concurrence
.
    
<EOS>
Finding
the
door
unlatched
,
his
suspicion
was
confirmed
,
and
he
made
no
scruple
of
creeping
into
the
chamber
on
all
-
four
;
so
that
the
painter
having
stript
himself
to
the
shirt
,
in
groping
about
for
his
Dulcinea
's
bed
,
chanced
to
lay
his
hand
upon
the
shaven
crown
of
the
father
's
head
,
which
by
a
circular
motion
,
the
priest
began
to
turn
round
in
his
grasp
,
like
a
ball
in
a
socket
,
to
the
surprize
and
consternation
of
poor
Pallet
,
who
having
neither
penetration
to
comprehend
the
case
,
nor
resolution
to
withdraw
his
fingers
from
this
strange
object
of
his
touch
,
stood
sweating
in
the
dark
,
and
vented
ejaculations
with
great
devotion
,
till
the
friar
tired
with
this
exercise
,
and
the
painful
posture
in
which
he
stooped
,
raised
himself
gradually
upon
his
feet
,
heaving
up
at
the
same
time
the
hand
of
the
painter
,
whose
terror
and
amazement
increased
to
such
a
degree
at
this
unaccountable
elevation
,
that
his
faculties
began
to
fail
;
and
his
palm
in
the
confusion
of
his
fright
sliding
over
the
priest
's
forehead
,
one
of
his
fingers
happened
to
slip
into
his
mouth
,
and
was
immediately
secured
between
the
Capuchin
's
teeth
,
with
as
firm
<EOS>
a
fixure
,
as
if
it
had
been
screwed
in
a
blacksmith
's
vice
.
<EOS>
The
painter
was
so
much
disordered
by
this
sudden
snap
,
which
tortured
him
to
the
bone
,
that
forgetting
all
other
considerations
,
he
roared
aloud
,
"
Murder
!
<EOS>
fire
!
<EOS>
a
trap
,
a
trap
!
<EOS>
help
,
christians
,
for
the
love
of
God
help
!
<EOS>
"
Our
hero
confounded
by
these
exclamations
,
which
he
knew
would
soon
fill
the
room
with
spectators
,
and
incensed
at
his
own
mortifying
disappointment
,
was
obliged
to
quit
the
untasted
banquet
,
and
approaching
the
cause
of
his
misfortune
,
just
as
his
tormentor
had
thought
proper
to
release
his
finger
,
discharged
such
a
hearty
slap
between
his
shoulders
,
as
brought
him
to
the
ground
with
hideous
bellowing
,
then
retiring
unperceived
,
to
his
own
chamber
,
was
one
of
the
first
who
returned
with
a
light
,
on
pretence
of
having
been
alarmed
with
his
cries
.
    
<EOS>
The
Capuchin
had
taken
the
same
precaution
,
and
followed
Peregrine
into
the
room
,
pronouncing
Benedicite
,
and
crossing
himself
with
many
marks
of
astonishment
;
and
the
physician
and
Jolter
appearing
at
the
same
time
,
the
unfortunate
painter
was
found
lying
naked
on
the
floor
,
in
all
the
agony
of
horror
and
dismay
,
blowing
upon
his
left
hand
,
that
hung
dangling
from
the
elbow
,
like
a
boy
who
had
burnt
his
fingers
,
in
attempting
to
snatch
roasted
chesnuts
from
the
fire
.
<EOS>
The
circumstance
of
his
being
found
in
that
apartment
,
and
the
attitude
of
his
affliction
,
which
was
extremely
ridiculous
,
provoked
the
doctor
to
a
smile
,
and
produced
a
small
relaxation
in
the
severity
of
the
governor
's
countenance
;
while
Pickle
,
testifying
surprize
and
concern
,
lifted
him
from
the
ground
,
and
enquired
into
the
cause
of
his
present
situation
.
<EOS>
Having
,
after
some
recollection
,
and
fruitless
endeavours
to
speak
,
recovered
the
use
of
his
tongue
,
he
told
them
that
the
house
was
certainly
haunted
by
evil
spirits
,
by
which
he
had
been
conveyed
(
he
knew
not
how
)
into
that
apartment
,
and
afflicted
with
all
the
tortures
of
hell
;
that
one
of
them
had
made
itself
sensible
to
his
feeling
,
in
the
shape
of
a
round
ball
of
smooth
flesh
,
that
turned
round
under
his
hand
,
like
an
astronomer
's
globe
,
and
then
rising
up
to
a
surprising
height
,
was
converted
into
a
machine
that
laid
hold
on
his
finger
,
by
a
snap
,
and
having
pinned
him
to
the
spot
,
he
continued
for
some
moments
in
unspeakable
agony
,
till
at
last
the
engine
seemed
to
melt
away
from
his
finger
,
and
he
received
a
sudden
thwack
upon
his
shoulders
,
as
if
discharged
by
the
arm
of
a
giant
,
which
overthrew
him
in
an
instant
upon
the
floor
.
<EOS>
The
priest
hearing
this
strange
account
,
pulled
out
of
one
of
his
pouches
a
piece
of
consecrated
candle
,
which
he
lighted
immediately
,
and
muttered
certain
mysterious
conjurations
.
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
imagining
that
Pallet
was
drunk
,
shook
his
head
,
saying
,
he
believed
the
spirit
was
no
where
but
in
his
own
brain
.
<EOS>
The
physician
,
for
once
,
condescended
to
be
a
wag
,
and
looking
towards
one
of
the
beds
,
observed
,
that
in
his
opinion
,
the
painter
had
been
misled
by
the
flesh
,
and
not
by
the
spirit
.
<EOS>
The
fair
Fleming
lay
in
silent
astonishment
and
affright
;
and
her
fellow
-
lodger
,
in
order
to
acquit
herself
of
all
suspicion
,
exclaimed
with
incredible
volubility
,
against
the
author
of
this
uproar
,
who
(
she
did
not
doubt
)
had
concealed
himself
in
the
apartment
,
with
a
view
of
perpetrating
some
wicked
attempt
upon
her
precious
virtue
,
and
was
punished
and
prevented
by
the
immediate
interposition
of
heaven
.
<EOS>
At
her
desire
,
therefore
,
and
the
earnest
sollicitation
of
the
other
lady
,
he
was
conducted
to
his
own
bed
,
and
the
chamber
being
evacuated
,
they
locked
their
door
,
fully
resolved
to
admit
no
more
visitants
for
that
night
:
while
Peregrine
,
mad
with
seeing
the
delicious
morsel
,
snatched
(
as
it
were
)
from
his
very
lip
,
stalked
through
the
passage
,
like
a
ghost
,
in
hopes
of
finding
some
opportunity
of
re
-
entering
,
till
the
day
beginning
to
break
,
he
was
obliged
to
retire
,
cursing
the
ideotical
conduct
of
the
painter
,
which
had
so
unluckily
interfered
with
his
delight
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LIX
   
<EOS>
Next
day
,
about
one
o'clock
,
after
having
seen
every
thing
remarkable
in
town
,
and
been
present
at
the
execution
of
two
youths
,
who
were
hanged
for
ravishing
a
whore
,
they
took
their
departure
from
Ghent
,
in
the
same
carriage
which
had
brought
them
thither
;
and
the
conversation
turning
upon
the
punishment
they
had
seen
inflicted
,
the
Flemish
beauty
expressed
great
sympathy
and
compassion
for
the
unhappy
sufferers
,
who
(
as
she
had
been
informed
)
had
fallen
victims
to
the
malice
of
the
accuser
.
<EOS>
Her
sentiments
were
espoused
by
all
the
company
,
except
the
French
lady
of
pleasure
,
who
,
thinking
the
credit
of
the
sisterhood
concerned
in
the
affair
,
bitterly
inveighed
against
the
profligacy
of
the
age
,
and
particularly
the
base
and
villainous
attempts
of
man
,
upon
the
chastity
of
the
weaker
sex
;
saying
,
with
a
look
of
indignation
directed
to
the
painter
,
that
for
her
own
part
,
she
should
never
be
able
to
manifest
the
acknowledgment
she
owed
to
providence
,
for
having
protected
her
,
last
night
,
from
the
wicked
aims
of
unbridled
lust
.
    
<EOS>
This
observation
introduced
a
series
of
jokes
,
at
the
expence
of
Pallet
,
who
hung
his
ears
,
and
sat
with
a
silent
air
of
dejection
,
fearing
that
through
the
malevolence
of
the
physician
,
his
adventure
might
reach
the
ears
of
his
wife
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
though
we
have
made
shift
to
explain
the
whole
transaction
to
the
reader
,
it
was
an
inextricable
mystery
to
every
individual
in
the
diligence
;
because
the
part
which
was
acted
by
the
Capuchin
,
was
known
to
himself
alone
;
and
even
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
Pickle
's
being
concerned
in
the
affair
;
so
that
the
greatest
share
of
the
painter
's
sufferings
were
supposed
to
be
the
exaggerations
of
his
own
extravagant
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
their
discourse
on
this
extraordinary
subject
,
the
driver
told
them
,
that
they
were
now
on
the
very
spot
where
a
detachment
of
the
allied
army
had
been
intercepted
and
cut
off
by
the
French
;
and
stopping
the
vehicle
,
entertained
them
with
a
local
description
of
the
battle
of
Melle
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
occasion
,
the
Flemish
lady
,
who
since
her
marriage
had
become
a
keen
partizan
for
the
French
,
gave
a
minute
detail
of
all
the
circumstances
,
as
they
had
been
represented
to
her
by
her
husband
's
brother
,
who
was
in
the
action
;
and
this
account
,
which
sunk
the
number
of
the
French
to
sixteen
,
and
raised
that
of
the
allies
to
twenty
thousand
men
,
was
so
disagreeable
to
truth
,
as
well
as
to
the
laudable
partiality
of
Peregrine
,
that
he
ventured
to
contradict
her
assertions
,
and
a
fierce
dispute
commenced
,
that
not
only
regarded
the
present
question
,
but
also
comprehended
all
the
battles
in
which
the
duke
of
Marlborough
had
commanded
against
Lewis
the
fourteenth
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
these
debates
,
she
divested
that
great
general
of
all
the
glory
he
had
acquired
,
by
affirming
,
that
every
victory
he
gained
,
was
purposely
lost
by
the
French
generals
,
in
order
to
bring
the
schemes
of
madam
de
Maintenon
into
discredit
;
and
as
a
particular
instance
,
alledged
that
while
the
citadel
of
Lisle
was
besieged
,
Lewis
said
,
in
presence
of
the
Dauphin
,
that
if
the
allies
should
be
obliged
to
raise
the
siege
,
he
would
immediately
declare
his
marriage
with
that
lady
;
upon
which
,
the
son
sent
private
orders
to
marshal
Boufflers
to
surrender
the
place
.
<EOS>
This
strange
allegation
was
supported
by
the
asseverations
of
the
priest
and
the
courtezan
,
and
admitted
as
truth
by
the
governor
,
who
pretended
to
have
heard
it
from
good
authority
:
while
the
doctor
sat
neutral
,
as
one
who
thought
it
scandalous
to
know
the
history
of
such
modern
events
;
and
the
Israelite
,
being
a
true
Dutchman
,
listed
himself
under
the
banners
of
our
hero
,
who
in
attempting
to
demonstrate
the
absurdity
and
improbability
of
what
they
had
advanced
,
raised
such
a
hue
and
cry
against
himself
,
and
being
insensibly
heated
in
the
altercation
,
irritated
his
Amanda
to
such
a
degree
,
that
her
charming
eyes
kindled
with
fury
,
and
he
saw
great
reason
to
think
,
that
if
he
did
not
fall
upon
some
method
to
deprecate
her
wrath
,
she
would
in
a
twinkling
sacrifice
all
her
esteem
for
him
,
to
her
own
zeal
for
the
glory
of
the
French
nation
.
<EOS>
Swayed
by
this
apprehension
,
his
ardour
cooled
by
degrees
,
and
he
insensibly
detached
himself
from
the
argument
,
leaving
the
whole
care
of
supporting
it
on
the
Jew
,
who
finding
himself
deserted
,
was
fain
to
yeild
at
discretion
;
so
that
the
French
remained
masters
of
the
field
,
and
their
young
heroine
resumed
her
good
humour
.
    
<EOS>
And
let
the
circumstances
of
this
contention
warn
the
reader
,
against
all
disputes
with
female
politicians
;
unless
he
is
desirous
of
incuring
their
animosity
and
implacable
resentment
;
for
,
in
matters
of
state
,
they
are
all
,
to
a
woman
,
enthusiasts
,
who
believe
that
all
those
who
differ
from
them
in
opinion
,
are
in
a
state
of
reprobation
;
and
,
far
from
laying
any
stress
upon
probability
,
in
the
articles
of
their
faith
,
like
believers
of
another
class
,
disdainfully
reject
the
evidence
of
reason
,
and
trust
to
the
revelation
of
their
own
fancy
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
having
therefore
prudently
submitted
to
the
superior
intelligence
of
his
fair
enslaver
,
began
to
be
harrassed
with
the
fears
of
losing
her
for
ever
,
upon
their
arrival
at
Brussels
,
and
set
his
invention
at
work
,
to
contrive
some
means
of
indemnifying
himself
for
his
assiduities
,
presents
,
and
the
disappointment
he
had
already
undergone
,
before
they
should
reach
that
city
:
on
pretence
of
enjoying
a
freer
air
,
he
mounted
the
box
,
and
employed
his
elocution
and
generosity
with
such
success
,
that
the
driver
undertook
to
disable
the
Diligence
from
proceeding
beyond
the
town
of
Alost
for
that
day
;
and
in
consequence
of
his
promise
,
gently
overturned
it
,
when
they
were
about
a
mile
short
of
that
baiting
place
.
<EOS>
He
had
taken
his
measures
so
discreetly
,
that
this
accident
was
attended
with
no
other
inconvenience
than
a
fit
of
fear
,
that
took
possession
of
the
ladies
,
and
the
necessity
to
which
they
were
reduced
,
by
the
declaration
of
the
coachman
,
who
,
upon
examining
the
carriage
,
assured
the
company
that
the
axle
-
tree
had
given
way
,
and
advised
them
to
walk
forward
to
the
inn
,
while
he
would
jog
after
them
at
a
slow
pace
,
and
do
his
endeavour
that
the
damage
should
be
immediately
repaired
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
pretended
to
be
very
much
concerned
at
what
had
happened
,
and
even
cursed
the
driver
for
his
inadvertency
,
expressing
infinite
impatience
to
be
at
Brussels
,
and
wishing
that
this
misfortune
might
not
detain
them
another
night
upon
the
road
;
but
when
his
understapper
,
according
to
his
instructions
,
came
afterwards
to
the
inn
,
and
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
the
workman
he
had
employed
,
could
not
possibly
refit
the
machine
in
less
than
six
hours
,
the
crafty
youth
affected
to
lose
all
temper
,
stormed
at
his
emissary
,
whom
he
reviled
in
the
most
opprobious
terms
,
and
threatened
to
cane
for
his
misconduct
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
protested
,
with
great
humility
,
that
their
being
overturned
was
owing
to
the
failure
of
the
axle
-
tree
,
and
not
to
his
want
of
care
or
dexterity
in
driving
;
though
rather
than
be
thought
the
cause
of
incommoding
him
,
he
would
inquire
for
a
post
-
chaise
,
in
which
he
might
depart
for
Brussels
immediately
.
<EOS>
This
expedient
Pickle
rejected
,
unless
the
whole
company
could
be
accommodated
in
the
same
manner
;
and
he
had
been
previously
informed
by
the
driver
,
that
the
town
could
not
furnish
more
than
one
vehicle
of
that
sort
.
<EOS>
His
governor
,
who
was
quite
ignorant
of
his
scheme
,
represented
that
one
night
would
soon
be
passed
,
and
exhorted
him
to
bear
this
small
disappointment
with
a
good
grace
,
especially
as
the
house
seemed
to
be
well
provided
for
their
entertainment
,
and
the
company
so
much
disposed
to
be
sociable
.
    
<EOS>
The
Capuchin
,
who
had
found
his
account
in
cultivating
the
acquaintance
of
the
young
stranger
,
was
not
ill
-
pleased
at
this
event
,
which
might
,
by
protracting
the
term
of
their
intercourse
,
yield
him
some
opportunity
of
profiting
still
further
by
his
liberality
:
he
therefore
joined
Mr
Jolter
in
his
admonitions
,
congratulating
himself
upon
the
prospect
of
enjoying
his
conversation
a
little
longer
than
he
had
expected
;
and
our
young
gentleman
received
a
compliment
to
the
same
purpose
from
the
Hebrew
,
who
had
that
day
exercised
his
gallantry
upon
the
French
coquette
,
and
was
not
without
hope
of
reaping
the
fruits
of
his
attention
,
his
rival
,
the
painter
,
being
quite
disgraced
and
dejected
by
the
adventure
of
last
night
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
doctor
,
he
was
too
much
engrossed
in
the
contemplation
of
his
own
importance
,
to
interest
himself
in
the
affair
,
or
its
consequences
,
further
than
by
observing
,
that
the
European
powers
ought
to
establish
public
games
,
like
those
that
were
celebrated
of
old
in
Greece
;
in
which
case
,
every
state
would
be
supplied
with
such
dextrous
charioteers
,
as
could
drive
a
machine
at
full
speed
,
within
a
hair
's
breadth
of
a
precipice
,
without
any
danger
of
its
being
overthrown
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
could
not
help
yielding
to
their
remonstrances
,
and
united
complaisance
,
for
which
he
thanked
them
in
very
polite
terms
,
and
his
passion
seeming
to
subside
,
proposed
that
they
should
amuse
themselves
in
walking
round
the
ramparts
,
with
a
view
of
enjoying
some
private
conversation
with
his
admired
Fleming
,
who
had
this
whole
day
behaved
with
remarkable
reserve
.
<EOS>
The
proposal
being
embraced
,
he
(
as
usual
)
handed
her
into
the
street
,
and
took
all
opportunities
of
promoting
his
suit
;
but
they
were
attended
so
closely
by
her
father
confessor
,
that
he
foresaw
it
would
be
impracticable
to
accomplish
his
aim
,
without
the
connivance
of
that
ecclesiastick
,
which
he
was
obliged
to
purchase
with
another
purse
,
that
he
offered
,
and
was
accepted
as
a
charitable
atonement
for
his
criminal
behaviour
during
the
interview
which
the
friar
had
procured
for
the
good
of
his
soul
.
    
<EOS>
This
benefaction
was
no
sooner
made
,
than
the
pious
mendicant
edged
off
by
little
and
little
,
till
he
joined
the
rest
of
the
company
,
leaving
his
generous
patron
at
full
liberty
to
prosecute
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
our
adventurer
made
a
good
use
of
this
occasion
:
he
practised
a
thousand
flowers
of
rhetoric
,
and
actually
exhausted
his
whole
address
,
in
persuading
her
to
have
compassion
upon
his
misery
,
and
indulge
him
with
another
private
audience
,
without
which
he
should
run
distracted
,
and
be
guilty
of
extravagancies
,
which
,
in
the
humanity
of
her
disposition
,
she
would
weep
to
see
.
<EOS>
But
,
instead
of
complying
with
his
request
,
she
chid
him
severely
for
his
presumption
,
in
persecuting
her
with
his
vicious
addresses
;
and
assured
him
,
that
although
she
had
secured
a
chamber
for
herself
in
this
place
,
because
she
had
no
ambition
to
be
better
acquainted
with
the
other
lady
,
he
would
be
in
the
wrong
to
disturb
her
with
another
nocturnal
visit
;
for
she
was
determined
to
deny
him
admittance
.
<EOS>
The
lover
was
comforted
by
this
hint
,
which
he
understood
in
the
true
acceptation
,
and
his
passion
being
inflamed
by
the
obstacles
he
had
met
with
in
this
intrigue
,
his
heart
beat
high
with
the
prospect
of
possession
.
<EOS>
These
raptures
of
expectation
produced
an
inquietude
,
which
disabled
him
from
bearing
that
share
of
the
conversation
for
which
he
used
to
be
distinguished
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
at
supper
was
a
vicissitude
of
startings
,
and
reveries
;
and
the
Capuchin
imputing
this
disorder
to
a
second
repulse
from
his
charge
,
began
to
be
invaded
with
the
apprehension
of
being
obliged
to
refund
,
and
in
a
whisper
forbad
our
hero
to
despair
.

Chapter
LX
<EOS>
The
French
coquet
entraps
the
heart
of
the
Jew
,
against
whom
Pallet
enters
into
a
conspiracy
;
by
which
Peregrine
is
again
disappointed
,
and
the
Hebrew
's
incontinence
exposed
.
   
<EOS>
Mean
while
the
French
syren
,
baulked
in
her
design
upon
her
English
cully
,
who
was
so
easily
disheartened
,
and
hung
his
ears
in
manifest
despondence
,
rather
than
run
the
risque
of
making
a
voyage
that
should
be
altogether
unprofitable
,
resolved
to
practise
her
charms
upon
the
Dutch
merchant
;
and
had
already
made
such
innovation
upon
his
heart
,
that
he
cultivated
her
with
peculiar
complacency
,
gazed
upon
her
with
a
most
libidinous
stare
,
and
unbended
his
aspect
into
a
grin
that
was
truly
Israelitish
.
<EOS>
The
painter
saw
,
and
was
offended
at
this
correspondence
,
which
he
considered
as
an
insult
upon
his
misfortune
,
as
well
as
an
evident
preference
of
his
rival
;
and
,
conscious
of
his
own
timidity
,
swallowed
an
extraordinary
glass
,
that
his
invention
might
be
stimulated
,
and
his
resolution
raised
to
the
contrivance
and
execution
of
some
scheme
of
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
The
wine
,
however
,
failed
in
the
expected
effect
,
and
without
inspiring
him
with
the
plan
,
served
only
to
quicken
his
desire
of
vengeance
;
so
that
he
communicated
his
purpose
to
his
friend
Peregrine
,
and
begged
the
assistance
of
his
imagination
;
but
our
young
gentleman
was
too
intent
upon
his
own
affair
,
to
mind
the
concerns
of
any
other
person
,
and
he
declining
to
be
engaged
in
the
project
,
Pallet
had
recourse
to
the
genius
of
Pickle
's
valet
de
chambre
,
who
readily
embarked
in
the
undertaking
,
and
invented
a
plan
,
which
was
executed
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
The
evening
being
pretty
far
advanced
,
and
the
company
separated
into
their
respective
apartments
,
<EOS>
Pickle
repaired
,
in
all
the
impatience
of
youth
and
desire
,
to
the
chamber
of
his
charmer
,
and
finding
the
door
unbolted
,
entered
in
a
transport
of
joy
.
<EOS>
By
the
light
of
the
moon
,
which
shone
through
the
window
,
he
was
conducted
to
her
bed
,
which
he
approached
in
the
utmost
agitation
,
and
perceiving
her
to
all
appearance
asleep
,
essayed
to
wake
her
with
a
gentle
kiss
;
but
this
method
proved
ineffectual
,
because
she
was
determined
to
save
herself
the
confusion
of
being
an
accomplice
in
his
guilt
.
<EOS>
He
repeated
the
application
,
murmured
a
most
passionate
salutation
in
her
ear
,
and
took
such
other
gentle
methods
of
signifying
his
presence
,
as
persuaded
him
that
she
was
resolved
to
sleep
,
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavours
:
flushed
with
this
agreeable
supposition
,
he
locked
the
door
,
in
order
to
prevent
interruption
,
and
stealing
himself
under
the
cloaths
,
set
fortune
at
defiance
,
while
he
held
the
fair
creature
circled
in
his
arms
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
near
as
he
seemed
to
be
to
the
happy
accomplishment
of
his
desire
,
his
hope
was
again
frustrated
by
a
fearful
noise
,
which
in
a
moment
waked
his
Amanda
in
a
fright
,
and
for
the
present
engaged
all
his
attention
:
<EOS>
his
valet
de
chambre
,
whom
Pallet
had
consulted
as
a
confederate
,
in
his
revenge
against
the
lady
of
pleasure
and
her
Jewish
gallant
,
had
hired
of
certain
Behemians
,
who
chanced
to
lodge
at
the
inn
,
a
jack
-
ass
adorned
with
bells
,
which
,
when
every
body
was
retired
to
rest
,
and
the
Hebrew
supposed
to
be
bedded
with
his
mistress
,
they
led
up
-
stairs
into
a
long
thoroughfare
,
from
which
the
chambers
were
detached
on
each
side
;
and
the
painter
,
perceiving
the
lady
's
door
a
-
jar
,
according
to
his
expectation
,
mounted
this
animal
,
with
intention
to
ride
into
the
room
,
and
disturb
the
lovers
in
the
midst
of
their
mutual
endearments
;
but
the
ass
,
true
to
his
kind
,
finding
himself
bestrid
by
an
unknown
rider
,
instead
of
advancing
,
in
obedience
to
his
conductor
,
retreated
backwards
to
the
other
end
of
the
passage
,
in
spite
of
all
the
efforts
of
the
painter
,
who
spurred
,
and
kicked
,
and
pummelled
to
no
purpose
.
<EOS>
It
was
the
noise
of
this
contention
between
Pallet
and
the
ass
,
which
invaded
the
ears
of
Peregrine
and
his
mistress
,
neither
of
whom
could
form
the
least
rational
conjecture
about
the
cause
of
such
strange
disturbance
,
which
increased
as
the
animals
approached
their
apartment
;
till
,
at
length
,
the
Bourrique
's
retrograde
motion
was
obstructed
by
their
door
,
which
it
burst
open
,
in
a
twinkling
,
with
one
kick
,
and
entered
with
such
complication
of
sound
,
as
terrified
the
lady
almost
into
a
fit
,
and
threw
her
lover
into
an
agony
of
perplexity
and
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
,
finding
himself
thus
violently
intruded
into
the
bed
-
chamber
of
he
knew
not
whom
,
and
dreading
the
resentment
of
the
possessor
,
who
might
discharge
a
pistol
at
him
,
as
a
robber
who
had
broke
into
his
apartment
,
was
overwhelmed
with
consternation
,
and
redoubled
his
exertion
,
to
accomplish
a
speedy
retreat
,
sweating
all
the
time
with
fear
,
and
putting
up
petitions
to
heaven
for
his
safety
;
but
his
obstinate
companion
,
regardless
of
his
situation
,
instead
of
submitting
to
his
conduct
,
began
to
turn
round
like
a
millstone
,
the
united
sound
of
his
feet
and
bells
producing
a
most
surprising
concert
.
<EOS>
The
unfortunate
rider
,
whirled
about
in
this
manner
,
would
have
quitted
his
seat
,
and
left
the
beast
to
his
own
amusement
,
but
the
rotation
was
so
rapid
,
that
the
terror
of
a
severe
fall
hindered
him
from
attempting
to
dismount
,
and
in
the
desperation
of
his
heart
,
he
seized
one
of
its
ears
,
which
he
pinched
so
unmercifully
,
that
the
creature
set
up
his
throat
,
and
brayed
aloud
.
<EOS>
This
hideous
exclamation
was
no
sooner
heard
by
the
fair
Fleming
,
already
chilled
with
panic
,
and
prepared
with
superstition
,
than
,
believing
herself
visited
by
the
devil
,
who
was
permitted
to
punish
her
for
her
infidelity
to
the
marriage
-
bed
,
she
uttered
a
fearful
scream
,
and
began
to
repeat
her
paternoster
with
a
loud
voice
.
<EOS>
Her
lover
,
finding
himself
under
the
necessity
of
retiring
,
started
up
,
and
stung
with
the
most
violent
pangs
of
rage
and
disappointment
,
ran
directly
to
the
spot
from
whence
this
diabolical
noise
seemed
to
proceed
,
and
encountering
the
ass
,
discharged
such
a
volley
of
blows
at
him
and
his
rider
,
that
the
creature
carried
him
off
at
a
round
trot
,
and
they
roared
in
unison
all
the
way
.
<EOS>
Having
thus
cleared
the
room
of
such
disagreeable
company
,
he
went
back
to
his
mistress
,
and
assuring
her
,
that
this
was
only
some
foolish
prank
of
Pallet
,
took
his
leave
,
with
a
promise
of
returning
after
the
quiet
of
the
inn
should
be
re
-
established
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
the
noise
of
the
Bourrique
,
the
cries
of
the
painter
,
and
the
lady
's
scream
,
had
alarmed
the
whole
house
;
and
the
ass
,
in
the
precipitation
of
his
retreat
,
seeing
people
with
lights
before
him
,
took
shelter
in
the
apartment
for
which
he
was
at
first
designed
,
just
as
the
Levite
,
arroused
at
the
uproar
,
had
quitted
his
Dulcinea
,
and
was
attempting
to
recover
his
own
chamber
,
unperceived
;
but
,
seeing
himself
opposed
by
such
an
animal
,
mounted
by
a
tall
,
meagre
,
lanthorn
-
jawed
figure
,
half
naked
,
with
a
white
night
-
cap
upon
his
head
,
which
added
to
the
natural
paleness
of
his
complexion
,
the
Jew
was
sorely
troubled
in
mind
,
and
believing
it
to
be
an
apparition
of
Balaam
and
his
ass
,
fled
backward
with
a
nimble
pace
,
and
crept
under
the
bed
,
where
he
lay
concealed
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
and
the
priest
,
who
were
the
foremost
of
those
who
had
been
arroused
by
the
noise
,
were
not
unmoved
when
they
saw
such
a
spectacle
rushing
into
this
chamber
,
from
whence
the
lady
of
pleasure
began
to
shriek
.
<EOS>
The
governor
made
a
full
halt
,
and
the
Capuchin
discovered
no
inclination
to
proceed
.
<EOS>
They
were
(
however
)
by
the
pressure
of
the
crowd
that
followed
them
,
thrust
forward
to
the
door
,
through
which
the
vision
entered
;
and
<EOS>
there
Jolter
,
with
great
ceremony
,
complimented
his
reverence
with
the
pas
,
beseeching
him
to
walk
in
.
<EOS>
The
mendicant
was
too
courteous
and
humble
to
accept
this
preheminence
,
and
a
very
earnest
dispute
ensued
;
during
which
the
ass
,
in
the
course
of
his
circuit
,
shewed
himself
and
rider
,
and
in
a
trice
decided
the
contest
;
for
,
struck
with
this
second
glimpse
,
both
,
at
one
instant
,
sprung
backward
with
such
force
,
as
overturned
their
next
men
,
who
communicated
the
impulse
to
those
that
stood
behind
them
,
and
these
again
to
others
;
so
that
the
whole
passage
was
strewed
with
a
long
file
of
people
,
that
lay
in
a
line
,
like
the
sequel
and
dependance
of
a
pack
of
cards
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
havock
,
our
hero
returned
from
his
own
room
,
with
an
air
of
astonishment
,
asking
the
cause
of
this
uproar
,
and
receiving
such
hints
of
intelligence
as
Jolter
's
consternation
would
permit
him
to
give
,
snatched
the
candle
out
of
his
hand
,
and
advanced
into
the
haunted
chamber
without
hesitation
,
being
followed
by
all
present
,
who
broke
forth
into
a
long
and
loud
peal
of
laughter
,
when
they
perceived
the
ludicrous
source
of
their
disquiet
.
<EOS>
The
painter
himself
made
an
effort
to
join
their
mirth
,
but
he
had
been
so
harrowed
by
fear
,
and
smarted
so
much
with
the
pain
of
the
discipline
he
had
received
from
Pickle
,
that
he
could
not
,
with
all
his
endeavour
,
vanquish
the
ruefulness
of
his
countenance
;
and
his
attempt
served
only
to
increase
the
aukwardness
of
his
situation
,
which
was
not
at
all
mended
by
the
behaviour
of
the
coquette
,
who
,
furious
with
her
disappointment
,
slipped
on
a
petticoat
and
bed
-
gown
,
and
springing
upon
him
,
like
another
Hecuba
,
with
her
nails
,
deprived
all
one
side
of
his
nose
of
the
skin
,
and
would
not
have
left
him
an
eye
to
see
thro
'
,
if
some
of
the
company
had
not
rescued
him
from
her
unmerciful
talons
.
    
<EOS>
Provoked
at
this
outrage
,
as
well
as
by
her
behaviour
to
him
in
the
Diligence
,
he
publickly
explained
his
intention
in
entering
her
chamber
in
this
equipage
;
and
,
missing
the
Hebrew
among
the
spectators
,
assured
them
,
that
he
must
have
absconded
somewhere
in
the
apartment
:
in
consequence
of
this
intimation
,
the
room
was
immediately
searched
,
and
the
mortified
Levite
pulled
by
the
heels
from
his
lurking
place
;
so
that
Pallet
had
the
good
fortune
,
at
last
,
to
transfer
the
laugh
from
himself
to
his
rival
,
and
the
French
inamorata
,
who
accordingly
underwent
the
ridicule
of
the
whole
audience
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXI
Pallet
,
endeavouring
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
the
treatment
he
had
received
,
falls
out
of
the
frying
pan
into
the
fire
.
   
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Pallet
was
still
confounded
,
and
chagrined
by
one
consideration
,
which
was
no
other
than
that
of
his
having
been
so
roughly
handled
in
the
chamber
,
belonging
(
as
he
found
upon
enquiry
)
to
the
handsome
young
lady
,
who
was
under
the
Capuchin
's
direction
.
<EOS>
He
recollected
,
that
the
door
was
fast
locked
,
when
his
beast
burst
it
open
,
and
he
had
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
person
followed
him
in
his
irruption
:
on
the
other
hand
,
he
could
not
imagine
,
that
such
a
gentle
creature
would
either
attempt
to
commit
,
or
be
able
to
execute
such
a
desperate
assault
as
that
which
his
body
had
sustained
;
and
her
demeanor
was
so
modest
and
circumspect
,
that
he
durst
not
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
her
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
These
reflexions
bewildered
him
in
the
labyrinth
of
thought
:
he
rummaged
his
whole
imagination
,
endeavouring
to
account
for
what
had
happened
;
and
at
length
concluded
,
that
either
Peregrine
,
or
the
devil
,
or
both
,
must
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
affair
,
and
determined
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
his
curiosity
,
to
watch
our
hero
's
motions
,
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
night
,
so
narrowly
,
that
his
conduct
,
mysterious
as
it
was
,
should
not
be
able
to
elude
his
penetration
.
    
<EOS>
With
these
sentiments
he
retired
to
his
own
room
,
after
the
ass
had
been
restored
to
the
right
owners
,
and
the
priest
had
visited
and
confirmed
his
fair
ward
,
who
had
been
almost
distracted
with
fear
;
and
silence
no
sooner
prevailed
again
,
than
he
crawled
darkling
towards
her
door
,
and
huddled
himself
up
in
an
obscure
corner
,
from
whence
he
might
observe
the
ingress
or
egress
of
any
human
creaure
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
long
remained
in
this
posture
,
when
,
fatigued
with
this
adventure
,
and
that
of
the
preceding
night
,
his
faculties
were
gradually
overpowered
with
slumber
,
and
falling
fast
asleep
,
he
began
to
snore
like
a
whole
congregation
of
presbyterians
.
<EOS>
The
Flemish
beauty
,
hearing
this
discordant
noise
in
the
passage
,
began
to
be
afraid
of
some
new
alarm
,
and
very
prudently
bolted
her
door
;
so
that
when
her
lover
wanted
to
repeat
his
visit
,
he
was
not
only
surprised
and
incensed
at
this
disagreeable
serenade
,
the
author
of
which
he
did
not
know
;
but
when
,
compelled
by
his
passion
,
which
was
by
this
time
wound
to
the
highest
pitch
,
he
ventured
to
approach
the
entrance
,
he
had
the
extreme
mortification
to
find
himself
shut
out
;
and
he
durst
not
knock
,
or
signify
his
presence
in
any
other
manner
,
on
account
of
the
lady
's
reputation
,
which
would
have
greatly
suffered
,
<EOS>
had
the
snorer
been
waked
by
his
endeavours
.
    
<EOS>
Had
he
known
that
the
person
who
thus
thwarted
his
views
,
was
the
painter
,
he
would
have
taken
some
effectual
step
to
remove
him
;
but
he
could
not
conceive
what
should
induce
Pallet
to
take
up
his
residence
in
that
corner
;
nor
could
he
use
the
assistance
of
a
light
,
to
distinguish
him
,
because
there
was
not
a
candle
burning
in
the
house
;
and
besides
,
the
sleeper
might
have
opened
his
eyes
in
the
very
moment
of
his
being
detected
by
Peregrine
,
who
would
have
incurred
suspicion
,
by
appearing
,
at
such
an
hour
,
at
that
part
of
the
inn
,
so
remote
from
his
own
bed
-
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
describe
the
rage
and
vexation
of
our
hero
,
while
he
continued
thus
tantalized
upon
the
brink
of
bliss
,
after
his
desire
had
been
exasperated
by
the
circumstances
of
his
two
former
disappointments
.
<EOS>
He
ejaculated
a
thousand
execrations
against
his
own
fortune
,
cursed
all
his
fellow
-
travellers
,
without
exception
,
vowed
revenge
against
the
painter
,
who
had
twice
confounded
his
most
interesting
scheme
,
and
was
tempted
to
execute
immediate
vengeance
upon
the
unknown
cause
of
his
present
misadventure
.
<EOS>
In
this
agony
of
distraction
did
he
sweat
two
whole
hours
in
the
passage
,
though
not
without
some
faint
hope
of
being
delivered
from
his
tormentor
,
who
(
he
imagined
)
upon
waking
,
would
undoubtedly
shift
his
quarters
,
and
leave
the
field
free
to
his
designs
;
but
when
he
heard
the
cock
repeat
his
salutation
to
the
morn
,
which
began
to
open
on
the
rear
of
night
,
he
could
no
longer
restrain
his
indignation
,
but
going
to
his
own
chamber
,
filled
a
basin
with
cold
water
,
and
,
standing
at
some
distance
,
discharged
it
full
in
the
face
of
the
gaping
snorer
,
who
,
over
and
above
the
surprize
occasioned
by
the
application
,
was
almost
suffocated
by
the
liquor
that
entered
his
mouth
,
and
ran
down
into
his
wind
-
pipe
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
gasped
like
a
person
half
drowned
,
without
knowing
the
nature
of
his
disaster
,
or
remembring
the
situation
in
which
he
fell
asleep
;
Peregrine
retired
to
his
own
door
,
and
,
to
his
no
small
astonishment
,
from
a
long
howl
that
invaded
his
ears
,
learnt
that
the
patient
was
no
other
than
Pallet
,
who
had
now
,
for
the
third
time
,
baulked
his
good
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Enraged
at
the
complicated
trespasses
of
this
unfortunate
offender
,
he
rushed
from
his
apartment
with
a
horse
-
whip
,
and
encountering
the
painter
in
his
flight
,
overturned
him
in
the
passage
,
and
exercised
the
instrument
of
his
wrath
with
great
severity
,
on
pretence
of
mistaking
him
for
some
presumptuous
cur
,
which
had
disturbed
the
repose
of
the
inn
;
nay
,
when
he
called
aloud
for
mercy
in
a
supplicating
tone
,
and
his
chastiser
could
no
longer
pretend
to
treat
him
as
a
quadruped
,
such
was
the
virulence
of
the
young
gentleman
's
indignation
,
that
he
could
not
help
declaring
his
satisfaction
,
by
telling
Pallet
he
had
richly
deserved
the
punishment
he
had
undergone
,
for
his
madness
,
folly
and
impertinence
,
in
contriving
and
executing
such
idle
schemes
,
as
had
no
other
tendency
than
that
of
plaguing
his
neighbours
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
protested
with
great
vehemence
,
that
he
was
innocent
as
the
child
unborn
of
any
intention
to
give
umbrage
to
any
person
whatever
,
except
the
Israelite
and
his
doxy
,
who
he
knew
had
incurred
his
displeasure
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
as
God
is
my
Saviour
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
believe
I
am
persecuted
with
witchcraft
,
and
begin
to
think
that
damn'd
priest
is
an
agent
of
the
devil
;
for
he
has
been
but
two
nights
in
our
company
,
during
which
I
have
not
closed
an
eye
,
but
on
the
contrary
have
been
tormented
by
all
the
fiends
of
hell
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
peevishly
replied
,
that
his
torments
had
been
occasioned
by
his
own
foolish
imagination
;
and
asked
how
he
came
to
howl
in
that
corner
.
<EOS>
The
painter
,
who
did
not
think
proper
to
own
the
truth
,
said
,
that
he
had
been
transported
thither
by
some
preternatural
conveyance
,
and
soused
in
water
by
an
invisible
hand
:
and
the
youth
,
in
hope
of
profiting
by
his
absence
,
advised
him
to
retire
immediately
to
his
bed
,
and
by
sleep
strive
to
comfort
his
brain
,
which
seemed
to
be
not
a
little
disordered
by
the
want
of
that
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Pallet
himself
began
to
be
very
much
of
the
same
way
of
thinking
,
and
in
compliance
with
such
wholesome
counsel
,
betook
himself
to
rest
,
muttering
prayers
all
the
way
for
the
recovery
of
his
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
attended
him
to
his
chamber
,
and
locking
him
up
,
put
the
key
in
his
own
pocket
,
that
he
might
not
have
it
in
his
power
to
interrupt
him
again
:
but
in
his
return
he
was
met
by
Mr
Jolter
and
the
doctor
,
who
had
been
a
second
time
alarmed
by
the
painter
's
cries
,
and
come
thither
to
inquire
about
this
new
adventure
.
<EOS>
Half
frantic
with
such
a
series
of
disappointments
,
he
cursed
them
in
his
heart
for
their
unseasonable
appearance
;
and
when
they
questioned
him
about
Pallet
,
told
them
he
had
found
him
stark
staring
mad
,
howling
in
a
corner
and
wet
to
the
skin
,
and
conducted
him
to
his
room
,
where
he
was
now
abed
.
<EOS>
The
physician
hearing
this
circumstance
,
made
a
merit
of
his
vanity
,
and
under
pretence
of
concern
for
the
patient
's
welfare
,
desired
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
examining
the
symptoms
of
his
disorder
,
without
loss
of
time
;
alledging
,
that
many
diseases
might
have
been
stifled
in
the
birth
,
which
afterwards
baffled
all
the
endeavours
of
the
medical
art
.
    
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
accordingly
delivered
the
key
,
and
once
more
withdrew
into
his
own
chamber
,
with
a
view
of
seizing
the
first
occasion
that
should
present
itself
of
renewing
his
application
to
his
Amanda
's
door
;
while
the
doctor
,
in
his
way
to
Pallet
's
apartment
,
hinted
to
the
governor
his
suspicion
,
that
the
patient
laboured
under
that
dreadful
symptom
called
the
hydrophobia
,
which
he
observed
had
sometimes
appeared
in
persons
who
were
not
previously
bit
by
a
mad
dog
.
<EOS>
This
conjecture
he
founded
upon
the
howl
he
uttered
when
he
was
soused
with
water
,
and
began
to
recollect
certain
circumstances
of
the
painter
's
behaviour
for
some
day
's
past
,
which
now
he
could
plainly
perceive
had
prognosticated
some
such
calamity
.
<EOS>
He
then
ascribed
the
distemper
to
the
violent
frights
he
had
lately
undergone
,
affirmed
that
the
affair
of
the
Bastile
had
made
such
a
violent
incroachment
upon
his
understanding
,
that
his
manner
of
thinking
and
speaking
was
intirely
altered
;
and
by
a
theory
of
his
own
invention
,
explained
the
effects
of
fear
upon
a
loose
system
of
nerves
,
and
demonstrated
the
modus
in
which
the
animal
spirits
operate
upon
the
ideas
and
power
of
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
This
disquisition
,
which
was
communicated
at
the
painter
's
door
,
might
have
lasted
till
breakfast
,
had
not
Jolter
reminded
him
of
his
own
maxim
,
Venienti
occurrite
morbo
;
upon
which
he
put
the
key
to
immediate
use
,
and
they
walked
softly
towards
the
bed
,
where
the
patient
lay
extended
at
full
length
in
the
arms
of
slumber
.
    
<EOS>
The
physician
took
notice
of
his
breathing
hard
,
and
his
mouth
being
open
;
and
from
these
diagnostics
declared
,
that
the
liquidum
nervosum
was
intimately
affected
,
and
the
saliva
impregnated
with
the
spiculated
particles
of
the
virus
,
howsoever
contracted
.
<EOS>
This
sentence
was
still
farther
confirmed
by
the
state
of
his
pulse
,
which
being
full
and
slow
,
indicated
an
oppressed
circulation
,
from
a
loss
of
elasticity
in
the
propelling
arteries
;
and
he
proposed
,
that
he
should
immediately
suffer
a
second
aspersion
of
water
,
which
would
not
only
contribute
to
the
cure
,
but
also
certify
them
beyond
all
possibility
of
doubt
,
with
regard
to
the
state
of
the
disease
:
for
it
would
evidently
appear
,
from
the
manner
in
which
he
would
bear
the
application
,
whether
or
not
his
horror
of
water
amounted
to
a
confirmed
hydrophobia
.
<EOS>
Mr
Jolter
,
in
compliance
with
this
proposal
,
began
to
empty
a
bottle
of
water
,
which
he
found
in
the
room
in
a
basin
;
when
he
was
interrupted
by
the
prescriber
,
who
advised
him
to
use
the
contents
of
the
chamber
-
pot
,
which
being
impregnated
with
salt
,
would
operate
more
effectually
than
pure
element
.
<EOS>
Thus
directed
,
the
governor
lifted
up
the
vessel
,
which
was
replete
with
medicine
,
and
with
one
turn
of
his
hands
discharged
the
whole
healing
inundation
upon
the
ill
-
omen'd
patient
,
who
waking
in
the
utmost
distraction
of
horror
,
yelled
most
hideously
,
just
at
the
time
when
Peregrine
had
brought
his
mistress
to
a
parley
,
and
entertained
hopes
of
being
admitted
into
her
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
Terrified
at
this
exclamation
,
she
instantly
broke
off
the
treaty
,
beseeching
him
to
retire
from
the
door
,
that
her
honour
might
receive
no
injury
from
his
being
found
in
that
place
;
and
he
had
just
enough
of
recollection
left
to
see
the
necessity
of
obeying
the
order
;
in
conformity
to
which
he
retreated
,
well
nigh
deprived
of
his
senses
,
and
almost
persuaded
,
that
so
many
unaccountable
disappointments
must
have
proceeded
from
some
supernatural
cause
,
of
which
the
idiot
Pallet
was
no
more
than
the
involuntary
instrument
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
doctor
having
ascertained
the
malady
of
the
patient
,
whose
cries
,
interrupted
by
frequent
sobs
and
sighs
,
he
interpreted
into
the
barking
of
a
dog
;
having
no
more
salt
-
water
at
hand
,
resolved
to
renew
the
bath
with
such
materials
as
chance
would
afford
,
and
actually
laid
hold
of
the
bottle
and
basin
.
<EOS>
But
by
this
time
,
the
painter
had
recovered
the
use
of
his
senses
so
well
,
as
to
perceive
his
drift
;
and
starting
up
,
like
a
frantic
Bedlamite
,
ran
directly
to
his
sword
,
swearing
with
many
horrid
imprecations
,
that
he
would
murder
them
both
immediately
,
if
he
should
be
hanged
before
dinner
.
<EOS>
They
did
not
choose
to
wait
the
issue
of
his
threat
,
but
retired
with
such
precipitation
,
that
the
physician
had
almost
dislocated
his
shoulder
,
by
running
against
one
side
of
the
entry
;
and
Jolter
having
pulled
the
door
after
him
,
and
turned
the
key
,
betook
himself
to
flight
,
roaring
aloud
for
assistance
.
<EOS>
His
collegue
seeing
the
door
secured
,
valued
himself
upon
his
resolution
,
and
exhorted
him
to
return
;
declaring
,
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
was
more
afraid
of
the
madman
's
teeth
than
of
his
weapon
,
and
admonishing
the
governor
to
re
-
enter
,
and
execute
what
they
had
left
undone
;
"
Go
in
(
said
he
)
without
fear
or
apprehension
,
and
if
any
accident
shall
happen
to
you
,
either
from
his
slaver
or
his
sword
,
I
will
assist
you
with
my
advice
,
which
from
this
station
I
can
more
coolly
and
distinctly
administer
,
than
I
should
be
able
to
supply
,
if
my
ideas
were
disturbed
,
or
my
attention
engaged
in
any
personal
concern
.
"
    
<EOS>
Jolter
,
who
could
make
no
objection
to
the
justness
of
the
conclusion
,
frankly
owned
,
that
he
had
no
inclination
to
try
the
experiment
;
observing
,
<EOS>
that
self
preservation
was
the
first
law
of
nature
;
that
his
connexions
with
the
unhappy
lunatic
were
but
slight
,
and
that
it
could
not
be
reasonably
expected
,
that
he
would
run
such
risks
for
his
service
,
as
were
declined
by
one
who
had
set
out
with
him
from
England
on
the
footing
of
a
companion
.
<EOS>
This
insinuation
introduced
a
dispute
upon
the
nature
of
benevolence
and
the
moral
sense
,
which
(
the
republican
argued
)
existed
independent
of
any
private
consideration
,
and
could
never
be
affected
by
any
contingent
circumstance
of
time
and
fortune
;
while
the
other
,
who
abhorred
his
principles
,
asserted
the
duties
and
excellence
of
private
friendship
,
with
infinite
rancour
of
altercation
.
    
<EOS>
During
the
hottest
of
the
argument
,
they
were
joined
by
the
Capuchin
,
who
being
astonished
to
see
them
thus
virulently
engaged
at
the
door
,
and
to
hear
the
painter
bellowing
within
the
chamber
,
conjured
them
in
the
name
of
God
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
that
confusion
,
which
had
kept
the
whole
house
in
continual
alarm
during
the
best
part
of
the
night
,
and
seemed
to
be
the
immediate
work
of
the
devil
and
his
angels
.
<EOS>
When
the
governor
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
Pallet
was
visited
with
an
evil
spirit
,
he
muttered
a
prayer
of
St
Antonio
de
Padua
,
and
undertook
to
cure
the
painter
,
provided
he
could
be
secured
so
as
that
he
might
,
without
danger
to
himself
,
burn
part
of
a
certain
relick
under
his
nose
,
which
he
assured
them
was
equal
to
the
miraculous
power
of
Eleazar
's
ring
.
    
<EOS>
They
expressed
great
curiosity
to
know
what
this
treasure
was
;
and
the
priest
was
prevailed
upon
to
tell
them
in
confidence
,
that
it
was
a
collection
of
the
parings
of
the
nails
belonging
to
those
two
madmen
whom
Jesus
purged
of
the
legion
of
devils
that
afterwards
entered
the
swine
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
pulled
from
one
of
his
pockets
a
small
box
,
containing
about
an
ounce
of
the
parings
of
an
horse
's
hoof
;
at
sight
of
which
,
the
governor
could
not
help
smiling
,
on
account
of
the
grossness
of
the
imposition
;
and
the
doctor
asked
,
with
a
supercilious
smile
,
whether
those
maniacs
whom
Jesus
cured
,
were
of
the
sorrel
complexion
,
or
dapple
grey
;
for
,
from
the
texture
of
these
parings
,
he
could
prove
,
that
the
original
owners
were
of
the
quadruped
order
,
and
even
distinguish
,
that
their
feet
had
been
fortified
with
shoes
of
iron
.
    
<EOS>
The
mendicant
,
who
bore
an
inveterate
grudge
against
this
son
of
Aesculapius
,
ever
since
he
had
made
so
free
with
the
catholic
religion
,
replied
with
great
bitterness
,
that
he
was
a
wretch
with
whom
no
Christian
ought
to
communicate
;
that
the
vengeance
of
heaven
would
one
day
overtake
him
,
on
account
of
his
profanity
;
and
that
his
heart
was
shod
with
a
metal
much
harder
than
iron
,
which
he
was
afraid
<EOS>
nothing
but
hell
-
fire
would
be
able
to
melt
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
now
broad
day
,
and
all
the
servants
of
the
inn
were
afoot
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
seeing
it
would
be
impossible
to
obtain
any
sort
of
indemnification
for
the
time
he
had
lost
,
and
the
perturbation
of
his
spirits
hindering
him
from
enjoying
repose
,
which
was
,
moreover
,
obstructed
by
the
noise
of
Pallet
and
his
attendants
,
put
on
his
cloaths
at
once
,
and
in
exceeding
ill
humour
arrived
at
the
spot
where
this
triumvirate
stood
debating
about
the
means
of
overpowering
the
furious
painter
,
who
still
continued
his
song
of
oaths
and
execrations
,
and
made
sundry
efforts
to
break
open
the
door
.
<EOS>
Chagrin'd
as
our
hero
was
,
he
could
not
help
laughing
when
he
heard
how
the
patient
had
been
treated
;
and
his
indignation
changing
into
compassion
,
he
called
to
him
through
the
keyhole
,
desiring
to
know
the
reason
of
his
distracted
behaviour
.
<EOS>
Pallet
no
sooner
recognized
his
voice
,
than
lowering
his
own
to
a
whimpering
tone
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend

<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
have
at
last
detected
the
ruffians
who
have
persecuted
me
so
much
.
<EOS>
I
caught
them
in
the
fact
of
suffocating
me
with
cold
water
;
and
by
the
Lord
!
<EOS>
I
will
be
revenged
,
or
may
I
never
live
to
finish
my
Cleopatra

<EOS>
For
the
love
of
God

<EOS>
open
the
door
,
and
I
will
make
that
conceited
pagan
,
that
pretender
to
taste
,
that
false
devotee
of
the
ancients
,
who
poisons
people
with
sillykickabies
and
devil
's
dung
<EOS>
;
I
say
,
I
will
make
him
a
monument
of
my
wrath
,
and
an
example
to
all
the
cheats
and
impostors
of
the
faculty
:
and
as
for
that
thick
-
headed
insolent
pedant
his
confederate

who
emptied
my
own
jordan
upon
me
while
I
slept
,
he
had
better
have
been
in
his
beloved
Paris
,
botching
schemes
for
his
friend
the
pretender
,

incurred
the
effects

my
resentment

"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
told
him
,
that
his
conduct
had
been
so
extravagant
,
as
to
confirm
the
whole
company
in
the
belief
,
that
he
was
actually
deprived
of
his
senses
;
on
which
supposition
,
Mr
Jolter
and
the
doctor
had
acted
the
part
of
friends
,
in
doing
that
which
they
thought
most
couoncive
to
his
recovery
;
so
that
their
concern
merited
his
thankful
acknowledgment
,
instead
of
his
frantic
menaces
:
and
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
would
be
the
first
to
condemn
him
,
as
one
utterly
bereft
of
his
wits
,
and
give
orders
for
his
being
secured
as
a
madman
,
unless
he
would
immediately
give
a
proof
of
his
sanity
,
by
laying
aside
his
sword
,
composing
his
spirits
,
and
thanking
his
injured
friends
for
their
care
of
his
person
.
    
<EOS>
This
alternative
quieted
his
transports
in
a
moment
;
he
was
terrified
at
the
apprehension
of
being
treated
like
a
Bedlamite
,
being
dubious
of
the
state
of
his
own
brain
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
had
conceived
such
an
horror
and
antipathy
for
his
tormentors
,
that
,
far
from
believing
himself
obliged
by
what
they
had
done
,
he
could
not
even
think
of
them
without
the
utmost
rage
and
detestation
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
in
the
most
tranquil
voice
he
could
assume
,
protested
,
that
he
never
was
less
out
of
his
senses
than
at
present
,
though
he
did
not
know
how
long
he
might
retain
them
,
if
he
should
be
considered
in
the
light
of
a
lunatic
;
and
that
,
in
order
to
prove
his
being
compos
mentis
,
he
was
willing
to
sacrifice
the
resentment
be
so
justly
harboured
against
those
who
by
their
malice
had
brought
him
to
this
pass
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
apprehended
,
it
would
be
the
greatest
sign
of
madness
he
could
exhibit
,
to
thank
them
for
the
mischiefs
they
had
brought
upon
him
,
he
desired
to
be
excused
from
making
any
such
concession
,
and
swore
he
would
endure
every
thing
,
rather
than
be
guilty
of
such
mean
absurdity
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
held
a
consultation
upon
this
reply
,
when
the
governor
and
physician
strenuously
argued
against
any
capitulation
with
a
maniac
,
and
proposed
that
some
method
might
be
taken
to
seize
,
fetter
and
convey
him
into
a
dark
room
,
where
he
might
be
treated
according
to
the
rules
of
art
.
<EOS>
But
the
Capuchin
understanding
the
circumstances
of
the
case
,
undertook
to
restore
him
to
his
former
state
,
without
having
recourse
to
such
violent
measures
:
and
Pickle
,
who
was
a
better
judge
of
the
affair
than
any
person
present
,
opened
the
door
without
further
hesitation
,
and
displayed
the
poor
painter
standing
with
a
woeful
countenance
,
shivering
in
his
shirt
,
which
was
as
wet
as
if
he
had
been
dragged
through
the
Dender
;
a
spectacle
which
gave
such
offence
to
the
chaste
eyes
of
the
Hebrew
's
mistress
,
who
was
by
this
time
one
of
the
spectators
,
that
she
turned
her
head
another
way
,
and
withdrew
to
her
own
room
,
exclaiming
against
the
indecent
practices
of
men
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
,
seeing
the
young
gentleman
enter
,
ran
to
him
,
and
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
called
him
his
best
friend
,
and
said
he
had
rescued
him
from
those
who
had
a
design
against
his
life
.
<EOS>
The
priest
would
have
produced
his
parings
,
and
applied
them
to
his
nose
;
but
was
hindered
by
Pickle
,
who
advised
the
patient
to
shift
himself
,
and
put
on
his
cloaths
:
and
this
being
done
with
great
order
and
deliberation
,
Mr
Jolter
,
who
,
with
the
doctor
,
had
kept
at
a
wary
distance
,
in
expectation
of
seeing
some
strange
effects
of
his
distraction
,
began
to
believe
that
he
had
been
guilty
of
a
mistake
,
and
accused
the
physician
of
having
misled
him
by
his
false
diagnostic
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
still
insisted
upon
his
former
declaration
,
assuring
him
,
that
although
Pallet
enjoyed
a
short
interval
for
the
present
,
the
delirium
would
soon
recur
,
unless
they
would
profit
by
this
momentary
calm
,
and
order
him
to
be
blooded
,
blistered
and
purged
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
,
however
,
notwithstanding
this
caution
,
advanced
to
the
injured
party
,
and
begg'd
pardon
for
the
share
he
had
in
giving
him
such
disturbance
,
declaring
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
he
had
no
other
intention
than
that
of
contributing
towards
his
welfare
,
and
that
his
behaviour
was
the
result
of
the
physician
's
prescription
,
which
he
affirmed
was
absolutely
necessary
for
the
recovery
of
his
health
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
,
who
had
very
little
gall
in
his
disposition
,
was
satisfied
with
this
apology
;
but
his
resentment
,
which
was
before
divided
,
now
glowed
with
double
fire
against
his
first
fellow
-
traveller
,
whom
he
looked
upon
as
the
author
of
all
the
mischances
he
had
undergone
,
and
marked
out
for
his
vengeance
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
doors
or
reconciliation
were
not
shut
against
the
doctor
,
who
with
great
justice
might
have
transferred
this
load
of
offence
from
himself
to
Peregrine
,
who
was
,
without
doubt
,
the
source
of
the
painter
's
misfortune
:
but
,
in
that
case
,
he
must
have
owned
himself
mistaken
in
his
medical
capacity
;
and
he
did
not
think
the
friendship
of
Pallet
important
enough
to
sway
him
to
such
condescension
;
so
that
he
resolved
to
neglect
him
intirely
,
and
gradually
forget
the
former
correspondence
he
had
maintained
with
a
person
whom
he
deemed
so
unworthy
of
his
notice
.

Things
being
thus
adjusted
,
and
all
the
company
dressed
,
they
went
to
breakfast
about
five
in
the
morning
,
and
in
less
than
an
hour
after
were
seated
in
the
Diligence
,
where
a
profound
silence
prevailed
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
used
to
be
the
life
of
the
society
,
being
extremely
pensive
and
melancholy
on
account
of
his
mishap
,
the
Israelite
and
his
Dulcinea
dejected
in
consequence
of
their
disgrace
,
the
poet
absorpt
in
lofty
meditation
,
the
painter
in
schemes
of
revenge
,
while
Jolter
,
rocked
by
the
motion
of
the
carriage
,
made
himself
amends
for
the
want
of
rest
he
had
sustained
,
and
the
Mendicant
,
with
his
fair
charge
,
were
infested
by
the
cloudy
aspect
of
our
youth
,
in
whose
disappointment
each
of
them
,
for
different
reasons
,
bore
no
inconsiderable
share
.
<EOS>
This
general
languor
and
recess
from
all
bodily
exercise
,
disposed
them
all
to
receive
the
gentle
yoke
of
slumber
,
and
in
half
an
hour
after
they
had
embarked
,
there
was
not
one
of
them
awake
,
except
our
hero
and
his
mistress
,
unless
the
Capuchin
was
pleased
to
counterfeit
sleep
,
in
order
to
indulge
our
young
gentleman
with
an
opportunity
of
enjoying
some
private
conversation
with
his
beauteous
ward
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
did
not
neglect
the
occasion
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
seized
the
first
minute
,
and
in
gentle
murmurs
lamented
his
hard
hap
in
being
thus
the
sport
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
He
assured
her
(
and
that
with
great
sincerity
)
that
all
the
cross
accidents
of
his
life
had
not
cost
him
one
half
of
the
vexation
and
keenness
of
chagrin
which
he
had
suffered
last
night
;
and
that
now
he
was
on
the
brink
of
parting
from
her
,
he
should
be
overwhelmed
with
the
blackest
despair
,
if
she
would
not
extend
her
compassion
so
far
as
to
give
him
an
opportunity
of
sighing
at
her
feet
in
Brussels
,
during
the
few
days
his
affairs
would
permit
him
to
spend
in
that
city
.
    
<EOS>
This
young
lady
,
with
an
air
of
mortification
,
expressed
her
sorrow
for
being
the
innocent
cause
of
his
anxiety
;
said
,
she
hoped
last
night
's
adventure
would
be
a
salutary
warning
to
both
their
souls
;
for
she
was
persuaded
,
that
her
virtue
was
protected
by
the
intervention
of
heaven
;
that
whatever
impression
it
might
have
made
upon
him
,
she
was
enabled
by
it
to
adhere
to
that
duty
from
which
her
passion
had
begun
to
swerve
,
and
beseeching
him
to
forget
her
for
his
own
peace
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
neither
the
plan
she
had
laid
down
for
her
own
conduct
,
nor
the
dictates
of
her
honour
,
would
allow
her
to
receive
his
visits
,
or
carry
on
any
other
correspondence
with
him
,
while
she
was
restricted
by
the
articles
of
her
marriage
-
vow
.
    
<EOS>
This
explanation
produced
such
a
violent
effect
upon
her
admirer
,
that
he
was
for
some
minutes
deprived
of
the
faculty
of
speech
,
which
he
no
sooner
recovered
,
than
he
gave
vent
to
the
most
unbridled
transports
of
passion
.
    
<EOS>
He
taxed
her
with
barbarity
and
indifference
;
told
her
that
she
had
robbed
him
of
his
reason
and
internal
peace
;
that
he
would
follow
her
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
,
and
cease
to
live
sooner
than
cease
to
love
her
;
that
he
would
sacrifice
the
innocent
fool
who
had
been
the
occasion
of
all
this
disquiet
,
and
murder
every
man
whom
he
considered
as
an
obstruction
to
his
views
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
his
passions
,
which
had
continued
so
long
in
a
state
of
the
highest
fermentation
,
together
with
the
want
of
that
repose
which
calms
and
quiets
the
perturbation
of
the
spirits
,
had
wrought
him
up
to
a
pitch
of
real
distraction
:
and
while
he
uttered
these
delirious
expressions
,
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
and
he
underwent
such
agitation
,
that
the
tender
heart
of
the
fair
Fleming
was
affected
with
his
condition
;
and
,
while
her
own
face
was
bedewed
with
the
streams
of
sympathy
,
she
begged
him
for
heaven
's
sake
to
be
composed
,
and
promised
,
for
his
satisfaction
,
to
abate
somewhat
of
the
rigor
of
her
purpose
.
<EOS>
Consoled
by
this
kind
declaration
,
he
recollected
himself
,
and
taking
out
his
pencil
,
gave
her
his
address
,
when
she
had
assured
him
,
that
he
should
hear
from
her
in
four
and
twenty
hours
at
farthest
,
after
their
separation
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
soothed
,
he
regained
the
empire
of
himself
,
and
by
degrees
recovered
his
serenity
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
case
with
his
Amanda
,
who
,
from
this
sample
of
his
disposition
,
dreaded
the
impetuosity
of
his
youth
,
and
was
effectually
deterred
from
entering
into
any
engagements
that
might
subject
her
peace
and
reputation
to
the
rash
effects
of
such
a
violent
spirit
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
captivated
by
his
person
and
accomplishments
,
she
had
reflection
enough
to
foresee
,
that
the
longer
she
countenanced
his
passion
,
her
own
heart
would
be
more
and
more
irretrievably
engaged
,
and
the
quiet
of
her
life
the
more
exposed
to
continual
interruption
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
profited
by
these
considerations
,
and
a
sense
of
religious
honour
,
which
helped
her
to
withstand
the
suggestions
of
inclination
;
and
resolved
to
amuse
her
lover
with
false
hopes
,
until
she
should
have
it
in
her
power
to
relinquish
his
conversation
,
without
running
any
risk
of
suffering
by
the
inconsiderate
sallies
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
It
was
with
this
view
,
that
she
desired
he
would
not
insist
upon
attending
her
to
her
mother
's
house
,
when
the
Diligence
arrived
at
Brussels
;
and
he
,
cajoled
by
her
artifice
,
took
a
formal
leave
of
her
,
together
with
the
other
strangers
,
fixing
his
habitation
at
the
inn
to
which
he
and
his
fellow
-
travellers
had
been
directed
,
in
the
impatient
expectation
of
receiving
a
kind
summons
from
her
,
within
the
limited
time
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
in
order
to
divert
his
imagination
,
he
went
to
see
the
stadthouse
,
park
and
arsenal
,
took
a
superficial
view
of
the
famous
bookseller
's
cabinet
of
curiosities
,
and
spent
the
evening
at
the
Italian
opera
,
which
was
at
that
time
exhibited
for
the
entertainment
of
Prince
Charles
of
Lorrain
,
then
governor
of
the
Low
Countries
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
stated
period
was
almost
elapsed
,
when
Peregrine
was
favoured
with
a
letter
to
this
purpose
:
    
"
SIR
,
If
you
knew
what
violence
I
do
my
own
heart
,
in
declaring
that
I
have
withdrawn
myself
for
ever
from
your
addresses
,
you
would
surely
applaud
the
sacrifice
I
make
to
virtue
,
and
strive
to
imitate
this
example
of
self
-
denial
.
<EOS>
Yes
,
Sir
,
heaven
hath
lent
me
grace
to
struggle
with
my
guilty
passion
,
and
henceforth
to
avoid
the
dangerous
sight
of
him
who
inspired
it
.
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
conjure
you
,
by
the
regard
you
ought
to
have
for
the
eternal
welfare
of
us
both
,
as
well
as
by
the
esteem
and
affection
you
profess
,
to
war
with
your
unruly
inclination
,
and
desist
from
all
attempts
of
frustrating
the
laudable
resolution
I
have
made
.
<EOS>
Seek
not
to
invade
the
peace
of
one
who
loves
you
,
to
disturb
the
quiet
of
a
family
that
never
did
you
wrong
,
and
alienate
the
thoughts
of
a
weak
woman
from
a
deserving
man
,
who
,
by
the
most
sacred
claim
,
is
vested
  
with
the
full
possession
of
her
heart
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
billet
,
without
either
date
or
subscription
,
banished
all
remains
of
discretion
from
the
mind
of
our
hero
,
who
ran
instantly
to
the
landlord
,
in
all
the
extasy
of
madness
,
and
demanded
to
see
the
messenger
who
brought
the
letter
,
on
pain
of
putting
his
whole
family
to
the
sword
.
<EOS>
The
innkeeper
,
terrified
by
his
looks
and
menaces
,
fell
upon
his
knees
,
protesting
in
the
face
of
heaven
,
that
he
was
utterly
ignorant
and
innocent
of
any
thing
that
could
give
him
offence
,
and
that
the
billet
was
brought
by
a
person
whom
he
did
not
know
,
and
who
retired
immediately
,
saying
,
it
required
no
answer
.
<EOS>
He
then
gave
utterance
to
his
fury
,
in
a
thousand
imprecations
and
invectives
against
the
writer
,
whom
he
dishonoured
with
the
appellations
of
a
coquette
,
a
jilt
,
an
adventurer
,
who
,
by
means
of
a
pimping
priest
,
had
defrauded
him
of
his
money
.
    
<EOS>
He
denounced
vengeance
against
the
Mendicant
,
whom
he
swore
he
would
castrate
,
if
ever
he
should
set
eyes
on
him
again
:
and
the
painter
unluckily
appearing
during
this
paroxysm
of
rage
,
he
seized
him
by
the
throat
,
saying
he
was
ruined
by
his
accursed
folly
;
and
in
all
likelihood
poor
Pallet
would
have
been
strangled
,
had
not
Jolter
interposed
in
his
behalf
,
beseeching
his
pupil
to
have
mercy
upon
the
sufferer
,
and
with
infinite
anxiety
desiring
to
know
the
cause
of
this
violent
assault
.
<EOS>
He
received
no
answer
,
but
a
string
of
incoherent
curses
,
and
when
the
painter
,
with
unspeakable
astonishment
,
took
God
to
witness
,
that
he
had
done
nothing
to
disoblige
him
,
the
governor
began
to
think
in
sad
earnest
,
that
Peregrine
's
vivacity
had
at
length
risen
to
the
transports
of
actual
madness
,
and
was
himself
almost
distracted
with
this
supposition
.
<EOS>
That
he
might
the
better
judge
what
remedy
ought
to
be
applied
,
he
used
his
whole
influence
,
and
practised
all
his
eloquence
upon
the
youth
,
in
order
to
learn
the
immediate
cause
of
his
delirium
.
<EOS>
He
employed
the
most
pathetic
intreaties
,
and
even
shed
tears
in
the
course
of
his
supplication
;
so
that
Pickle
(
the
first
violence
of
the
hurricane
being
blown
over
)
<EOS>
was
ashamed
of
his
own
imprudence
,
and
retired
to
his
chamber
,
in
order
to
recollect
his
dissipated
thoughts
:
there
he
shut
himself
up
,
and
,
for
the
second
time
,
perusing
the
fatal
epistle
,
began
to
waver
in
his
opinion
of
the
author
's
character
and
intention
.
<EOS>
He
sometimes
considered
her
as
one
of
those
nymphs
who
,
under
the
mask
of
innocence
and
simplicity
,
practise
upon
the
hearts
and
purses
of
unwary
and
unexperienced
youths
:
this
was
the
suggestion
of
his
wrath
,
inflamed
by
disappointment
;
but
,
when
he
reflected
upon
the
circumstances
of
her
behaviour
,
and
recalled
her
particular
charms
to
his
imagination
,
the
severity
of
his
censure
gave
way
,
and
his
heart
declared
in
favour
of
her
sincerity
.
    
<EOS>
Yet
even
this
consideration
aggravated
the
sense
of
his
loss
,
and
he
was
in
danger
of
relapsing
into
his
former
distraction
,
when
his
passion
was
a
little
becalmed
by
the
hope
of
seeing
her
again
,
either
by
accident
,
or
in
the
course
of
a
diligent
and
minute
inquiry
,
which
he
forthwith
resolved
to
set
on
foot
.
<EOS>
He
had
reason
to
believe
,
that
her
own
heart
would
espouse
his
cause
,
in
spite
of
her
virtue
's
determination
,
and
did
not
despair
of
meeting
with
the
Capuchin
,
<EOS>
whose
good
offices
he
knew
he
could
at
any
time
command
.
<EOS>
Comforted
with
these
reflexions
,
the
tempest
of
his
soul
subsided
,
and
in
less
than
two
hours
he
joined
his
company
with
an
air
of
composure
,
and
asked
the
painter
's
forgiveness
for
the
freedom
he
had
taken
,
the
cause
of
which
he
promised
hereafter
to
explain
.
<EOS>
Pallet
was
glad
of
being
reconciled
on
any
terms
to
one
whose
countenance
supported
him
in
aequilibrio
with
his
antagonist
the
doctor
;
and
Mr
Jolter
was
rejoiced
beyond
measure
at
his
pupil
's
recovery
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXIII
   
<EOS>
Every
thing
having
thus
resumed
its
natural
channel
,
they
dined
together
in
great
tranquillity
;
and
in
the
afternoon
,
Peregrine
,
on
pretence
of
staying
at
home
to
write
letters
,
while
his
companions
were
at
the
coffee
-
house
,
ordered
a
coach
to
be
called
,
and
with
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
was
the
only
person
acquainted
with
the
present
state
of
his
thoughts
,
set
out
for
the
Promenade
,
to
which
all
the
ladies
of
fashion
resort
in
the
evening
,
during
the
summer
-
season
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
his
fugitive
among
the
rest
.
    
<EOS>
Having
made
a
circuit
round
the
walk
,
and
narrowly
observed
every
female
in
the
place
,
he
perceived
at
some
distance
the
livery
of
Hornbeck
upon
a
lacquey
that
stood
at
the
back
of
a
coach
:
upon
which
,
he
ordered
his
man
to
reconnoitre
the
said
carriage
,
while
he
pulled
up
his
glasses
,
that
he
might
not
be
discovered
,
before
he
should
have
received
some
intelligence
,
by
which
he
might
conduct
himself
on
this
unexpected
occasion
,
that
already
began
to
interfere
with
the
purpose
of
his
coming
thither
,
though
it
could
not
dispute
his
attention
with
the
idea
of
his
charming
Unknown
.
    
<EOS>
His
Mercury
having
made
his
observations
,
reported
,
that
there
was
no
body
in
the
coach
but
Mrs
Hornbeck
and
an
elderly
woman
,
who
had
all
the
air
of
a
duenna
,
and
that
the
servant
was
not
the
same
footman
who
had
attended
them
in
France
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
information
,
our
hero
ordered
himself
to
be
driven
close
up
to
that
side
of
their
convenience
on
which
his
old
mistress
sat
,
and
accosted
her
with
the
usual
salutation
.
<EOS>
This
lady
no
sooner
beheld
her
gallant
,
than
her
cheeks
reddened
with
a
double
glow
;
and
she
exclaimed
,
"
Dear
brother
,
I
'm
overjoy'd
to
see
you
!
<EOS>
Pray
come
into
our
coach
.
"
<EOS>
He
took
the
hint
immediately
,
and
complying
with
her
request
,
embraced
this
new
sister
with
great
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Perceiving
that
her
attendant
was
very
much
surprised
and
alarmed
at
this
unexpected
meeting
,
she
,
in
order
to
banish
her
suspicion
,
and
at
the
same
time
give
her
lover
his
cue
,
told
him
that
his
brother
(
meaning
her
husband
)
was
gone
to
the
Spa
for
a
few
weeks
,
by
the
advice
of
physicians
,
on
account
of
his
ill
state
of
health
;
and
that
,
from
his
last
letter
,
she
had
the
pleasure
to
tell
him
,
he
was
in
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
this
piece
of
news
,
observing
with
an
air
of
fraternal
concern
,
that
if
his
brother
had
not
made
too
free
with
his
constitution
,
his
friends
in
England
would
have
had
no
occasion
to
repine
at
his
absence
and
want
of
health
,
by
which
he
was
banished
from
his
own
country
and
connexions
.
<EOS>
He
then
asked
with
an
affectation
of
surprize
,
why
she
had
not
accompanied
her
spouse
?
<EOS>
and
was
given
to
understand
,
that
his
tenderness
of
affection
would
not
suffer
him
to
expose
her
to
the
fatigues
of
the
journey
,
which
lay
among
rocks
that
were
almost
inaccessible
.
    
<EOS>
The
duenna
's
doubts
being
eased
by
this
preamble
of
conversation
,
he
changed
the
subject
to
the
pleasures
of
the
place
;
and
among
other
such
questions
,
inquired
if
she
had
as
yet
visited
Versailles
?
<EOS>
This
is
a
public
house
situated
upon
the
canal
,
at
the
distance
of
about
two
miles
from
town
,
and
accommodated
with
tolerable
gardens
for
the
entertainment
of
company
.
<EOS>
When
she
replied
in
the
negative
,
he
proposed
to
accompany
her
thither
immediately
;
but
the
governante
,
who
had
hitherto
sat
silent
,
objected
to
this
proposal
,
telling
them
,
in
broken
English
,
that
as
the
lady
was
under
her
care
,
she
could
not
answer
to
Mr
Hornbeck
for
allowing
her
to
visit
such
a
suspicious
place
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
As
for
that
matter
,
Madam
,
(
said
the
confident
gallant
)
give
yourself
no
trouble
,
the
consequences
shall
be
at
my
peril
;
and
I
will
undertake
to
insure
you
against
my
brother
's
resentment
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
directed
the
coachman
to
the
place
,
and
ordered
his
own
to
follow
,
under
the
auspices
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
while
the
old
gentlewoman
,
over
-
ruled
by
his
assurance
,
quietly
submitted
to
his
authority
.
    
<EOS>
Being
arrived
at
the
place
,
he
handed
the
ladies
from
the
coach
,
and
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
observed
that
the
duenna
was
lame
,
a
circumstance
of
which
he
did
not
scruple
to
take
the
advantage
;
for
they
had
scarce
alighted
,
and
drank
a
glass
of
wine
,
when
he
advised
his
sister
to
enjoy
a
walk
in
the
garden
:
and
although
the
attendant
made
shift
to
keep
them
almost
always
in
view
,
they
enjoyed
a
detached
conversation
,
in
which
Peregrine
learnt
,
that
the
true
cause
of
her
being
left
behind
at
Brussels
,
whilst
her
husband
proceeded
to
Spa
<EOS>
,
was
his
dread
of
the
company
and
familiarities
of
that
place
,
<EOS>
to
which
his
jealousy
durst
not
expose
her
;
and
that
she
had
lived
three
weeks
in
a
convent
at
Lisle
,
from
which
she
was
delivered
by
his
own
free
motion
,
because
indeed
he
could
no
longer
exist
without
her
company
;
and
lastly
,
our
lover
understood
,
that
her
governante
was
a
mere
dragon
,
who
had
been
recommended
to
him
by
a
Spanish
merchant
,
whose
wife
she
attended
to
her
dying
day
:
<EOS>
but
she
very
much
questioned
whether
or
not
her
fidelity
was
proof
enough
against
money
and
strong
waters
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
assured
her
the
experiment
should
be
tried
before
parting
;
and
they
agreed
to
pass
the
night
at
Versailles
,
provided
his
endeavours
should
succeed
.
    
<EOS>
Having
exercised
themselves
in
this
manner
,
until
his
duenna
's
spirits
were
pretty
much
exhausted
,
that
she
might
be
the
better
disposed
to
recruit
them
with
a
glass
of
liqueur
,
they
returned
to
their
apartment
,
and
the
cordial
was
recommended
and
received
in
a
bumper
:
<EOS>
but
as
it
did
not
produce
such
a
visible
alteration
as
the
sanguine
hopes
of
Pickle
had
made
him
expect
,
and
the
old
gentlewoman
observed
that
it
began
to
be
late
,
and
that
the
gates
would
be
shut
in
a
little
time
,
he
filled
up
a
parting
glass
,
and
pledged
her
in
equal
quantity
.
<EOS>
Her
blood
was
too
much
chilled
to
be
warmed
even
by
this
extraordinary
dose
,
which
made
immediate
innovation
in
the
brain
of
our
youth
,
who
in
the
gaiety
of
his
imagination
overwhelmed
this
She
-
Argus
with
such
profusion
of
gallantry
,
that
she
was
more
intoxicated
with
his
expressions
than
with
the
spirits
she
had
drank
;
and
when
in
the
course
of
toying
he
dropt
a
purse
into
her
bosom
,
she
seemed
to
forget
how
the
night
wore
,
and
with
the
approbation
of
her
charge
,
assented
to
his
proposal
of
having
something
for
supper
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
great
point
which
our
adventurer
had
gained
,
and
yet
he
plainly
perceived
that
the
governante
mistook
his
meaning
,
by
giving
herself
credit
for
all
the
passion
he
had
professed
.
<EOS>
As
this
error
could
be
rectified
by
no
other
means
than
those
of
plying
her
with
the
bottle
,
until
her
distinguishing
faculties
should
be
overpowered
,
he
promoted
a
quick
circulation
,
and
she
did
him
justice
,
without
any
manifest
signs
of
inebriation
,
so
long
,
that
his
own
eyes
began
to
reel
in
the
sockets
;
and
he
found
,
that
before
his
scheme
could
be
accomplished
,
he
should
be
effectually
unfitted
for
all
the
purposes
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
had
recourse
to
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
understood
the
hint
as
soon
as
it
was
given
,
and
readily
undertook
to
perform
the
part
,
of
which
his
master
had
play'd
<EOS>
the
prelude
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
settled
to
his
satisfaction
,
and
the
night
at
odds
with
morning
,
he
took
an
opportunity
of
imparting
to
the
ear
of
this
aged
Dulcinea
a
kind
whisper
,
importing
a
promise
of
visiting
her
,
when
his
sister
should
be
retired
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
an
earnest
desire
of
leaving
her
door
unlocked
.
    
<EOS>
This
agreeable
intimation
being
communicated
<EOS>
,
he
conveyed
a
caution
of
the
same
nature
to
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
as
he
led
her
to
her
apartment
;
and
darkness
and
silence
no
sooner
prevailed
in
the
house
,
than
he
and
his
trusty
squire
set
out
on
their
different
voyages
;
and
every
thing
would
have
succeeded
according
to
their
wish
,
had
not
the
valet
de
chambre
suffered
himself
to
fall
asleep
at
the
side
of
his
inamorata
,
and
in
the
agitation
of
a
violent
dream
,
exclaimed
in
a
voice
so
unlike
to
that
of
her
supposed
adorer
,
that
she
distinguished
the
difference
at
once
;
and
waking
him
with
a
pinch
and
a
loud
shriek
,
threatened
to
prosecute
him
for
a
rape
,
and
reviled
him
with
all
the
epithets
her
rage
and
disappointment
could
suggest
.
    
<EOS>
The
Frenchman
finding
himself
detected
,
behaved
with
great
temper
and
address
:
<EOS>
he
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
compose
herself
,
on
account
of
her
own
reputation
,
which
was
extremely
dear
to
him
;
protested
,
that
he
had
a
most
inviolable
esteem
for
her
person
;
and
that
if
he
had
not
already
given
convincing
proofs
of
his
passion
,
he
was
disposed
to
do
every
thing
in
his
power
for
her
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
These
representations
,
mingled
with
some
little
practical
expressions
of
tenderness
,
had
weight
with
the
duenna
,
who
,
upon
recollection
,
comprehended
the
whole
affair
,
and
thought
it
would
be
her
interest
to
bring
matters
to
an
accommodation
.
    
<EOS>
She
therefore
admitted
the
apologies
of
her
bedfellow
,
provided
he
would
promise
to
atone
by
marriage
for
the
injury
she
had
sustained
;
and
in
this
particular
he
set
her
heart
at
ease
by
repeated
vows
,
which
he
uttered
with
surprising
volubility
,
though
without
any
intention
to
perform
the
least
tittle
of
their
contents
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
had
been
alarmed
by
her
exclamation
,
and
run
to
the
door
with
a
view
of
interposing
,
according
to
the
emergency
of
the
case
,
over
-
hearing
the
affair
thus
compromised
,
returned
to
his
mistress
,
who
was
highly
entertained
with
an
account
of
what
had
passed
,
foreseeing
,
that
for
the
future
she
should
be
under
no
difficulty
or
restriction
from
the
severity
of
her
guard
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXIV
   
<EOS>
There
was
another
person
,
however
,
still
ungained
;
and
that
was
no
other
than
her
footman
,
whose
secrecy
our
hero
attempted
to
secure
in
the
morning
by
an
handsome
present
,
which
he
received
with
many
professions
of
gratitude
and
devotion
to
his
service
;
yet
this
complaisance
was
nothing
but
a
cloak
used
to
disguise
the
design
he
harboured
of
making
his
master
acquainted
with
the
whole
transaction
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
this
lacquey
had
been
hired
,
not
only
as
a
spy
upon
his
mistress
,
but
also
as
a
check
on
the
conduct
of
the
governante
,
with
promise
of
ample
reward
,
if
ever
he
should
discover
any
sinister
or
suspicious
practices
in
the
course
of
their
behaviour
:
and
as
for
the
footman
whom
they
had
brought
from
England
,
he
was
retained
in
attendance
upon
the
person
of
his
master
,
whose
confidence
he
had
lost
,
by
advising
him
to
gentle
methods
of
reclaiming
his
lady
,
when
her
irregularities
had
subjected
her
to
his
wrath
.
    
<EOS>
The
Flemish
valet
,
in
consequence
of
the
office
he
had
undertaken
,
wrote
to
Hornbeck
by
the
first
post
,
giving
an
exact
detail
of
the
adventure
at
Versailles
,
with
such
a
description
of
the
pretended
brother
,
as
left
the
husband
no
room
to
think
he
could
be
any
other
person
than
his
first
dishonourer
;
and
exasperated
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
resolved
to
lay
an
ambush
for
this
invader
,
and
at
once
disqualify
him
from
disturbing
his
repose
,
by
maintaining
further
correspondence
with
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
the
lovers
enjoyed
themselves
without
restraint
,
and
Peregrine
's
plan
of
inquiry
after
his
dear
Unknown
was
for
the
present
postponed
.
<EOS>
His
fellow
-
travellers
were
confounded
at
his
mysterious
motions
,
which
filled
the
heart
of
Jolter
with
anxiety
and
terror
.
<EOS>
This
careful
conductor
was
fraught
with
such
experience
of
his
pupil
's
disposition
,
that
he
trembled
with
the
apprehension
of
some
sudden
accident
,
and
lived
in
continual
alarm
,
like
a
man
that
walks
under
the
wall
of
a
nodding
tower
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
he
enjoy
any
alleviation
of
his
fears
,
when
upon
telling
the
young
gentleman
,
that
the
rest
of
the
company
were
desirous
of
departing
for
Antwerp
<EOS>
,
he
answered
,
they
were
at
liberty
to
consult
their
own
inclinations
;
but
for
his
own
part
,
he
was
resolved
to
stay
in
Brussels
a
few
days
longer
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
declaration
,
the
governor
was
confirmed
in
the
opinion
of
his
having
some
intrigue
upon
the
anvil
;
and
in
the
bitterness
of
his
vexation
,
took
the
liberty
of
signifying
his
suspicion
,
and
reminding
him
of
the
dangerous
dilemmas
to
which
he
had
been
reduced
by
his
former
precipitation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
took
his
caution
in
good
part
,
and
promised
to
behave
with
such
circumspection
,
as
would
screen
him
from
any
troublesome
consequences
for
the
future
:
but
,
nevertheless
,
behaved
that
same
evening
in
such
a
manner
,
as
plainly
shewed
,
that
his
prudence
was
nothing
else
than
vain
speculation
.
<EOS>
He
had
made
an
appointment
to
spend
the
night
,
as
usual
,
with
Mrs
Hornbeck
;
and
about
nine
o'clock
hastened
to
her
lodgings
,
when
he
was
accosted
in
the
street
by
his
old
discarded
friend
Thomas
Pipes
,
who
,
without
any
other
preamble
,
told
him
,
that
for
all
he
had
turned
him
adrift
,
he
did
not
choose
to
see
him
run
full
sail
into
his
enemy
's
harbour
,
without
giving
him
timely
notice
of
the
danger
.
<EOS>
"
I
'll
tell
you
<EOS>
what
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
mayhap
<EOS>
you
think
I
want
to
curry
favour
,
that
I
may
be
taken
in
tow
again
;
if
you
do
,
you
have
made
a
mistake
in
your
reckoning
.
<EOS>
I
am
old
enough
to
be
laid
up
,
and
have
wherewithal
to
keep
my
planks
from
the
weather
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
here
is
the
affair
;
I
have
known
you
since
you
were
no
higher
than
a
marlinespike
,
and
should
n't
care
to
see
you
deprived
of
your
carriages
at
these
years
:
whereby
I
am
informed
by
Hornbeck
's
man
,
whom
I
this
afternoon
fell
in
with
by
chance
,
as
how
his
master
has
got
intelligence
of
your
boarding
his
wife
,
and
has
steer'd
privately
into
this
port
,
with
a
large
compliment
of
hands
,
in
order
,
<EOS>
d'ye
see
,
to
secure
you
while
you
are
under
the
hatches
,
and
cut
away
your
tackle
,
without
fear
or
mercy
.
<EOS>
Now
if
so
be
as
how
you
have
a
mind
to
give
him
a
salt
eel
for
his
supper
,
here
am
I
,
without
hope
of
fee
or
reward
,
ready
to
stand
by
you
as
long
as
my
timbers
will
stick
together
;
and
if
I
expect
any
recompence
,
may
I
be
bound
to
eat
oakum
and
drink
bilge
-
water
for
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
Startled
at
this
information
,
Peregrine
examined
him
upon
the
particulars
of
his
discourse
with
the
lacquey
;
and
when
he
understood
that
Hornbeck
's
intelligence
flowed
from
the
canal
of
his
Flemish
footman
,
he
believed
every
circumstance
of
Tom
's
report
,
thanked
him
for
this
warning
,
and
after
having
reprimanded
him
for
his
misbehaviour
at
Lisle
,
assured
him
that
it
should
be
his
own
fault
if
ever
they
should
part
again
.
<EOS>
He
then
deliberated
with
himself
whether
or
not
he
should
retort
the
purpose
upon
his
adversary
;
but
,
when
he
considered
that
Hornbeck
was
not
the
aggressor
,
and
made
that
unhappy
husband
's
case
his
own
,
he
could
not
help
acquitting
his
intention
of
revenge
;
though
,
in
his
opinion
,
it
ought
to
have
been
executed
in
a
more
honourable
manner
;
and
therefore
he
determined
to
chastise
him
for
his
want
of
spirit
.
<EOS>
Nothing
surely
can
be
more
insolent
and
unjust
than
this
determination
,
which
induced
him
to
punish
a
person
,
for
his
want
of
courage
to
redress
the
injury
which
he
himself
had
done
to
his
reputation
and
peace
;
and
yet
this
barbarity
of
decision
is
sanctioned
by
the
opinion
and
practice
of
mankind
.
    
<EOS>
With
these
sentiments
he
returned
to
the
inn
,
and
putting
a
pair
of
pistols
in
his
pocket
,
ordered
his
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
to
follow
him
at
a
small
distance
,
so
as
that
they
should
be
within
call
,
in
case
of
necessity
,
and
posted
himself
within
thirty
yards
of
his
Dulcinea
's
door
.
<EOS>
There
he
had
not
been
above
half
an
hour
,
when
he
perceived
four
men
take
up
their
station
on
the
other
side
,
with
a
view
,
as
he
guessed
,
to
watch
for
his
going
in
,
that
he
might
be
taken
unaware
.
<EOS>
But
when
they
had
tarried
a
considerable
time
in
that
corner
,
without
reaping
the
fruits
of
their
expectation
,
their
leader
,
persuaded
that
the
gallant
had
gained
admittance
by
some
secret
means
,
approached
the
door
with
his
followers
,
who
,
according
to
the
instructions
they
had
received
,
no
sooner
saw
it
opened
,
than
they
rushed
in
,
leaving
their
employer
in
the
street
,
where
he
thought
his
person
would
be
least
endangered
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
seeing
him
alone
,
advanced
with
speed
,
and
clapping
a
pistol
to
his
breast
,
commanded
him
to
follow
his
footsteps
,
without
noise
,
on
pain
of
immediate
death
.
    
<EOS>
Terrified
at
this
sudden
apparition
,
Hornbeck
obeyed
in
silence
;
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
arrived
at
the
quay
,
where
Pickle
halting
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
was
no
stranger
to
his
villainous
design
;
and
told
him
,
that
if
he
conceived
himself
injured
by
any
circumstance
of
his
conduct
,
he
would
now
give
him
an
opportunity
of
resenting
the
wrong
,
in
a
manner
becoming
a
man
of
honour
.
<EOS>
"
You
have
a
sword
about
you
,
(
said
he
)
or
if
you
do
n't
choose
to
put
the
affair
on
that
issue
,
here
is
a
brace
of
pistols
,
take
which
you
please
.
<EOS>
"
Such
an
address
could
not
fail
to
disconcert
a
man
of
his
character
.
    
<EOS>
After
some
hesitation
,
he
in
a
faultering
accent
denied
that
his
design
was
to
mutilate
Mr
Pickle
,
but
that
he
thought
himself
intitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
law
,
by
which
he
would
have
obtained
a
divorce
,
if
he
could
have
procured
evidence
of
his
wife
's
infidelity
;
and
with
that
view
had
employed
people
to
take
advantage
of
the
information
he
had
received
.
<EOS>
With
regard
to
his
alternative
,
he
declined
it
intirely
,
because
he
could
not
see
what
satisfaction
he
should
enjoy
,
in
being
shot
through
the
head
,
or
run
through
the
lungs
,
by
a
person
who
had
already
wronged
him
in
an
irreparable
manner
;
and
lastly
,
his
fear
made
him
propose
,
that
the
affair
should
be
left
to
the
arbitration
of
two
creditable
men
,
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
dispute
.
    
<EOS>
To
these
remonstrances
,
Peregrine
replied
,
in
the
stile
of
a
hot
-
headed
young
man
,
conscious
of
his
own
unjustifiable
behaviour
,
that
every
gentleman
ought
to
be
a
judge
of
his
own
honour
;
and
therefore
he
would
submit
to
the
decision
of
no
umpire
whatsoever
;
that
he
would
forgive
his
want
of
courage
,
which
might
be
a
natural
infirmity
,
but
his
mean
dissimulation
he
could
not
pardon
;
and
that
,
as
he
was
certified
of
the
rascally
intent
of
his
ambuscade
,
by
undoubted
intelligence
,
he
would
treat
him
,
not
with
a
retaliation
of
his
own
treachery
,
but
with
such
indignity
as
a
scoundrel
deserves
to
suffer
;
unless
he
would
make
one
effort
to
maintain
the
character
he
assumed
in
life
:
<EOS>
so
saying
,
he
again
presented
his
pistol
,
which
being
rejected
as
before
,
he
called
his
two
ministers
,
and
ordered
them
to
duck
him
in
the
canal
.
    
<EOS>
This
command
was
pronounced
and
executed
almost
in
the
same
breath
,
to
the
unspeakable
terror
and
disorder
of
the
poor
shivering
patient
,
who
,
having
undergone
the
immersion
,
ran
about
like
a
drowned
rat
,
squeaking
for
assistance
and
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
His
cries
were
overheard
by
the
patrole
,
which
,
chancing
to
pass
that
way
,
took
him
under
their
protection
,
and
,
in
consequence
of
his
complaint
and
information
,
went
in
pursuit
of
our
adventurer
and
his
attendants
,
who
were
soon
overtaken
and
surrounded
.
<EOS>
Rash
and
inconsiderate
as
the
young
gentleman
was
,
he
did
not
pretend
to
stand
upon
the
defensive
,
against
a
file
of
musketeers
,
although
Pipes
had
drawn
his
cutlass
at
their
approach
,
but
surrendered
himself
without
opposition
,
and
was
conveyed
to
the
main
guard
,
where
the
commanding
officer
,
engaged
by
his
appearance
and
address
,
treated
him
with
all
imaginable
respect
,
and
hearing
the
particulars
of
his
adventure
,
assured
him
,
that
the
prince
would
consider
the
whole
as
a
Tour
de
jeunesse
,
and
order
him
to
be
released
without
delay
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
when
this
gentleman
gave
in
his
report
,
he
made
such
a
favourable
representation
of
the
prisoner
,
that
our
hero
was
on
the
point
of
being
discharged
;
when
Hornbeck
preferred
a
complaint
,
accusing
him
of
a
purposed
assassination
,
and
praying
that
such
punishment
should
be
inflicted
upon
him
,
as
his
highness
should
think
adequate
to
the
nature
of
the
crime
.
<EOS>
The
prince
,
perplexed
with
this
petition
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
foresaw
,
that
he
must
disoblige
a
British
subject
,
sent
for
the
plaintiff
,
of
whom
he
had
some
knowledge
,
and
in
person
exhorted
him
to
drop
the
prosecution
,
which
would
only
serve
to
propagate
his
own
shame
.
<EOS>
But
Hornbeck
was
too
much
incensed
to
listen
to
any
proposal
of
that
kind
,
and
peremptorily
demanded
justice
against
the
prisoner
,
whom
he
represented
as
an
obscure
adventurer
,
who
had
made
repeated
attempts
upon
his
honour
and
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
Prince
Charles
told
him
,
that
what
he
had
advised
was
in
the
capacity
of
a
friend
,
but
,
since
he
insisted
upon
his
acting
as
a
magistrate
,
the
affair
should
be
examined
,
and
determined
according
to
the
dictates
of
justice
and
truth
.
    
<EOS>
The
petitioner
being
dismissed
with
this
promise
,
the
defendant
was
in
his
turn
brought
before
<EOS>
the
judge
,
whose
prepossession
in
his
favour
,
was
in
a
great
measure
weakened
by
what
his
antagonist
had
said
to
the
prejudice
of
his
birth
and
reputation
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXV
   
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
understanding
from
some
expressions
which
escaped
the
prince
,
that
he
was
considered
in
the
light
of
a
sharper
and
assassin
,
begged
that
he
might
have
the
liberty
of
sending
for
some
vouchers
,
that
would
probably
vindicate
his
character
from
the
malicious
aspersions
of
his
adversary
;
and
this
permission
being
granted
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
his
governor
,
desiring
that
he
would
bring
to
him
the
letters
of
recommendation
which
he
had
received
from
the
British
embassador
at
Paris
,
and
such
other
papers
as
he
thought
conducive
to
evince
the
importance
of
his
situation
.
    
<EOS>
The
billet
was
given
in
charge
to
one
of
the
subaltern
officers
on
duty
,
who
carried
it
to
the
inn
,
and
demanded
to
speak
with
Mr
Jolter
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
,
who
happened
to
be
at
the
door
,
when
this
messenger
arrived
,
and
heard
him
enquire
for
the
tutor
,
ran
directly
to
that
gentleman
's
apartment
,
and
in
manifest
disorder
told
him
,
that
a
huge
fellow
of
a
soldier
,
with
a
monstrous
pair
of
whiskers
,
and
a
fur
-
cap
as
big
as
a
bushel
,
was
asking
for
him
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
The
poor
governor
began
to
shake
at
this
intimation
,
though
he
was
not
conscious
of
having
committed
any
thing
that
could
attract
the
attention
of
the
state
;
and
,
when
the
officer
appeared
at
his
chamber
-
door
,
his
confusion
increased
to
such
a
degree
,
that
his
perception
seemed
to
vanish
,
and
the
subaltern
repeated
the
purport
of
his
errand
three
times
,
before
he
could
comprehend
his
meaning
,
or
venture
to
receive
the
letter
which
he
presented
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
summoned
all
his
fortitude
,
and
having
perused
the
epistle
,
his
terror
sunk
into
anxiety
;
his
ingenious
fear
immediately
suggested
,
that
Peregrine
was
confined
in
a
dungeon
,
for
some
outrage
he
had
committed
;
he
ran
with
great
agitation
to
a
trunk
,
and
taking
out
a
bundle
of
papers
,
followed
his
conductor
,
being
attended
by
the
painter
,
to
whom
he
had
hinted
his
apprehension
.
<EOS>
When
they
passed
through
the
guard
,
which
was
under
arms
,
the
hearts
of
both
died
within
them
;
and
when
they
came
into
the
presence
,
there
was
such
an
expression
of
awful
horror
on
the
countenance
of
Jolter
,
that
the
prince
,
observing
his
dismay
,
was
pleased
to
encourage
him
with
an
assurance
,
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
comforted
,
he
recollected
himself
so
well
as
to
understand
his
pupil
,
when
he
desired
him
to
produce
the
Embassador
's
letters
;
some
of
which
being
open
,
were
immediately
read
by
his
highness
,
who
was
personally
acquainted
with
the
writer
,
and
knew
several
of
the
noblemen
to
whom
they
were
addressed
.
<EOS>
These
recommendations
were
so
warm
,
and
represented
the
young
gentleman
in
such
an
advantageous
light
,
that
the
prince
,
convinced
of
the
injustice
his
character
had
suffered
by
the
misrepresentation
of
Hornbeck
,
took
our
hero
by
the
hand
,
asked
pardon
for
the
doubts
he
had
entertained
of
his
honour
,
declared
him
from
that
moment
at
liberty
,
ordered
his
domesticks
to
be
enlarged
,
and
offered
him
his
countenance
and
protection
,
as
long
as
he
should
remain
in
the
Austrian
Netherlands
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
he
cautioned
him
against
indiscretion
in
the
course
of
his
gallantries
;
and
took
his
word
and
honour
,
that
he
should
drop
all
measures
of
resentment
against
the
person
of
Hornbeck
,
during
his
residence
in
that
place
.
    
<EOS>
The
delinquent
,
thus
honourably
acquitted
,
thanked
the
prince
in
the
most
respectful
manner
,
for
his
generosity
and
candour
,
and
retired
with
his
two
friends
,
who
were
amazed
and
bewildered
in
their
thoughts
,
at
what
they
had
seen
and
heard
,
the
whole
adventure
still
remaining
without
the
sphere
of
their
comprehension
,
which
was
not
at
all
enlarged
by
the
unaccountable
appearance
of
Pipes
,
who
,
with
the
valet
de
chambre
,
joined
them
at
the
castle
-
gate
.
<EOS>
Had
Jolter
been
a
man
of
a
luxuriant
imagination
,
his
brain
would
undoubtedly
have
suffered
in
the
investigation
of
his
pupil
's
mysterious
conduct
,
which
he
strove
in
vain
to
unravel
;
but
his
intellects
were
too
solid
to
be
affected
by
the
miscarriage
of
his
invention
;
and
as
Peregrine
did
not
think
proper
to
make
him
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
being
apprehended
,
he
contented
himself
with
supposing
,
that
there
was
a
lady
in
the
case
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
,
whose
imagination
was
of
a
more
flimsy
texture
,
formed
a
thousand
chimerical
conjectures
,
which
he
communicated
to
Pickle
,
in
imperfect
insinuations
,
hoping
,
by
his
answers
and
behaviour
,
to
discover
the
truth
;
but
the
youth
,
in
order
to
tantalize
him
,
eluded
all
his
enquiries
,
with
such
appearance
of
industry
and
art
,
as
heightened
his
curiosity
,
while
it
disappointed
his
aim
,
and
inflamed
him
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
his
wits
began
to
be
unsettled
,
and
Peregrine
was
fain
to
recompose
his
brain
,
by
telling
him
in
confidence
,
that
he
had
been
arrested
as
a
spy
.
<EOS>
This
secret
he
found
more
intolerable
than
his
former
uncertainty
;
he
ran
from
one
apartment
to
another
,
like
a
goose
in
the
agonies
of
egg
-
laying
,
with
intention
of
disburdening
this
important
load
;
but
,
Jolter
being
engaged
with
his
pupil
,
and
all
the
people
of
the
house
ignorant
of
the
only
language
he
could
speak
,
he
was
compelled
,
with
infinite
reluctance
,
to
address
himself
to
the
doctor
,
who
was
,
at
that
time
,
shut
up
in
his
own
chamber
.
<EOS>
Having
knocked
at
the
door
,
to
no
purpose
,
he
peeped
through
the
key
-
hole
,
and
saw
the
physician
sitting
at
a
table
,
with
a
pen
in
one
hand
,
and
paper
before
him
,
his
head
reclined
upon
his
other
hand
,
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
ceiling
,
as
if
he
had
been
intranced
.
<EOS>
Pallet
,
concluding
that
he
was
under
the
power
of
some
convulsion
,
endeavoured
to
force
the
door
open
,
and
the
noise
of
his
efforts
recalled
the
doctor
from
his
reverie
.
    
<EOS>
This
poetical
republican
,
being
so
disagreeably
disturbed
,
started
up
in
a
passion
,
and
opening
the
door
,
no
sooner
perceived
who
had
interrupted
him
,
than
he
flung
it
in
his
face
with
great
fury
,
and
cursed
him
for
his
impertinent
intrusion
,
which
had
deprived
him
of
the
most
delightful
vision
that
ever
regaled
the
human
fancy
.
<EOS>
He
imagined
,
(
as
he
afterwards
imparted
to
Peregrine
)
<EOS>
that
as
he
enjoyed
himself
in
walking
though
the
flowery
plain
that
borders
on
Parnassus
,
he
was
met
by
a
venerable
sage
,
whom
,
by
a
certain
divine
vivacity
that
lightened
from
his
eyes
,
he
instantly
knew
to
be
the
immortal
Pindar
.
<EOS>
He
was
immediately
struck
with
reverence
and
awe
,
and
prostrated
himself
before
the
apparition
,
which
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
lifted
him
gently
from
the
ground
;
and
with
words
more
sweet
than
the
honey
of
the
Hybla
bees
,
told
him
,
that
of
all
the
moderns
,
he
alone
was
visited
by
that
celestial
impulse
by
which
himself
had
been
inspired
,
when
he
produced
his
most
applauded
odes
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
led
him
up
the
sacred
hill
,
persuaded
him
to
drink
a
copious
draught
of
the
waters
of
the
Hippocrene
,
and
then
presented
him
to
the
harmonious
nine
,
who
crowned
his
temples
with
a
laurel
-
wreath
.
    
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
,
that
he
was
enraged
to
find
himself
cut
off
from
such
sublime
society
.
<EOS>
He
raved
in
Greek
against
the
invader
,
who
was
so
big
with
his
own
purpose
,
that
,
unmindful
of
the
disgrace
he
had
sustained
,
and
disregarding
all
the
symptoms
of
the
physician
's
displeasure
,
he
applied
his
mouth
to
the
door
,
and
in
eager
tone
,
"
I
'll
hold
you
any
wager
(
said
he
)
that
I
guess
the
true
cause
of
Mr
Pickle
's
imprisonment
.
"
    
<EOS>
To
this
challenge
he
received
no
reply
;
and
therefore
repeated
it
,
adding
,
"
I
suppose
you
imagine
he
was
taken
up
for
fighting
a
duel
,
or
affronting
a
nobleman
,
or
lying
with
some
man
's
wife
,
or
some
such
matter
;
but
,
agad
!
<EOS>
you
was
never
more
mistaken
in
your
life
;
and
I
'll
lay
my
Cleopatra
against
your
Homer
's
head
,
that
in
four
and
twenty
hours
you
sha
n't
light
on
the
true
reason
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
The
favourite
of
the
muses
,
exasperated
at
this
vexatious
perseverance
of
the
painter
,
who
he
imagined
had
come
thither
to
teize
and
insult
him
,
"
I
would
(
said
he
)
sacrifice
a
cock
to
Aesculapius
,
<EOS>
were
I
assured
that
any
person
had
been
taken
up
for
extirpating
such
a
troublesome
Goth
as
you
are
from
the
face
of
the
earth
;
and
as
for
your
boasted
Cleopatra
,
which
you
say
was
drawn
from
your
own
wife
,
I
believe
the
copy
has
as
much
of
the
to
kalon
as
the
original
.
<EOS>
But
,
were
it
mine
,
it
should
be
hung
up
in
the
temple
of
Cloacina
,
as
the
picture
of
that
goddess
;
for
any
other
apartment
would
be
disgraced
by
its
appearance
.
"
<EOS>
"
Hark
ye
,
Sir
,
(
replied
Pallet
,
enraged
in
his
turn
at
this
contemptuous
mention
of
his
darling
performance
)
you
may
make
as
free
with
my
wife
as
you
think
proper
;
but
'
ware
my
works
,
those
are
the
children
of
my
fancy
,
conceived
by
the
glowing
imagination
,
and
formed
by
the
art
of
my
own
hands
:
and
you
yourself
are
a
Goth
,
and
a
Turk
,
and
a
Tartar
,
and
an
impudent
pretending
jackanapes
,
to
treat
with
such
disrespect
a
production
which
,
in
the
opinions
of
all
the
connoisseurs
of
the
age
,
will
,
when
finished
,
be
a
master
-
piece
in
its
kind
,
and
do
honour
to
human
genius
and
skill
.
    
<EOS>
So
I
say
again
and
again
,
<EOS>
(
and
I
care
not
though
your
friend
Playtor
heard
me
)
that
you
have
no
more
taste
than
a
drayman
's
horse
,
and
that
those
foolish
notions
of
the
ancients
ought
to
be
drubb'd
out
of
you
with
a
good
cudgel
,
that
you
might
learn
to
treat
men
of
parts
with
more
veneration
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
you
may
not
always
be
in
the
company
of
one
who
will
hollow
for
assistance
,
when
you
are
on
the
brink
of
being
chastised
for
your
insolence
,
as
I
did
,
when
you
brought
upon
yourself
the
resentment
of
that
Scot
,
who
,
by
the
Lard
!
<EOS>
would
have
paid
you
both
scot
and
lot
,
as
Falstaf
says
,
if
the
French
officer
had
not
put
him
in
arrest
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
physician
to
this
declamation
,
which
was
conveyed
through
the
key
-
hole
,
answered
,
that
he
(
the
painter
)
was
a
fellow
so
infinitely
below
his
consideration
,
that
his
conscience
upbraided
him
with
no
action
of
his
life
,
except
that
of
choosing
such
a
wretch
for
his
companion
and
fellow
-
traveller
.
<EOS>
That
he
had
viewed
his
character
through
the
medium
of
good
nature
and
compassion
,
which
had
prompted
him
to
give
Pallet
an
opportunity
of
acquiring
some
new
ideas
under
his
immediate
instruction
;
but
he
had
abused
his
goodness
and
condescension
in
such
a
flagrant
manner
,
that
he
was
now
determined
to
discard
him
intirely
from
his
acquaintance
,
and
desired
him
,
for
the
present
,
to
take
himself
away
,
on
pain
of
being
kicked
for
his
presumption
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
was
too
much
incensed
to
be
intimidated
by
this
threat
,
which
he
retorted
with
great
virulence
,
defying
him
to
come
forth
,
that
it
might
appear
which
of
them
was
best
skilled
in
that
pedestrian
exercise
which
he
immediately
began
to
practise
against
the
door
with
such
thundering
application
,
as
reached
the
ears
of
Pickle
and
his
governor
,
who
coming
out
into
the
passage
,
and
seeing
him
thus
employed
,
asked
if
he
had
forgot
the
chamber
-
pots
of
Alost
,
that
he
ventured
to
behave
in
such
a
manner
,
as
intitled
him
to
a
second
prescription
of
the
same
nature
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
understanding
that
there
was
company
at
hand
,
opened
the
door
in
a
twinkling
,
and
springing
upon
his
antagonist
,
like
a
tyger
,
a
fierce
contention
would
have
ensued
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
our
hero
,
had
not
Jolter
,
to
the
manifest
peril
of
his
own
person
,
interposed
,
and
partly
by
force
,
and
partly
by
exhortations
,
put
a
stop
to
the
engagement
before
it
was
fairly
begun
.
<EOS>
After
having
demonstrated
the
indecency
of
such
a
vulgar
rencounter
betwixt
two
fellow
-
citizens
in
a
foreign
land
,
he
begg'd
to
know
the
cause
of
their
dissention
,
and
offered
his
good
offices
towards
an
accommodation
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
also
,
seeing
the
fray
was
finished
,
expressed
himself
to
the
same
purpose
;
and
the
painter
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
declining
an
explanation
,
his
antagonist
told
the
youth
what
a
mortifying
interruption
he
had
suffered
by
the
impertinent
intrusion
of
Pallet
,
and
gave
him
a
detail
of
the
particulars
of
his
vision
,
as
above
recited
.
<EOS>
The
arbiter
owned
,
the
provocation
was
not
to
be
endured
,
and
decreed
,
that
the
offender
should
make
some
atonement
for
his
transgression
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
the
painter
observed
,
that
howsoever
he
might
have
been
disposed
to
make
acknowledgments
,
if
the
physician
had
signified
his
displeasure
like
a
gentleman
,
the
complainant
had
now
forfeited
all
claim
to
any
such
concessions
,
by
the
vulgar
manner
in
which
he
had
reviled
him
and
his
productions
;
observing
,
that
if
he
(
the
painter
)
had
been
inclined
to
retort
his
slanderous
insinuations
,
the
republican
's
own
works
would
have
afforded
ample
subject
for
his
ridicule
and
censure
.
    
<EOS>
After
divers
disputes
and
representations
,
peace
was
at
length
concluded
,
on
condition
,
that
for
the
future
the
doctor
should
never
mention
Cleopatra
,
unless
he
could
say
something
in
her
praise
;
and
that
Pallet
,
in
consideration
of
his
having
been
the
first
aggressor
,
should
make
a
sketch
of
the
physician
's
vision
,
to
be
engraved
and
prefixed
to
the
next
edition
of
his
odes
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXVI
Peregrine
renews
his
inquiries
about
his
lost
Amanda
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
is
engaged
in
an
intrigue
with
a
nun
,
which
produces
strange
consequences
.
   
<EOS>
Though
this
treaty
was
concluded
at
the
instances
of
Peregrine
and
his
governor
,
it
was
impossible
that
a
lasting
friendship
could
subsist
between
the
two
parties
,
because
they
entertained
for
each
other
the
most
perfect
contempt
,
which
,
in
the
course
of
their
communication
,
could
not
fail
to
minister
daily
food
for
animosity
and
aversion
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
's
next
care
was
to
exercise
all
his
diligence
and
invention
to
find
his
lost
Amanda
,
who
,
now
that
he
was
detached
from
Mrs
Hornbeck
,
resumed
the
full
possession
of
his
thoughts
.
<EOS>
As
she
would
never
tell
him
her
own
name
,
or
that
of
her
mother
,
his
inquiries
were
directed
by
a
personal
description
only
;
and
that
,
in
such
a
populous
city
as
Brussels
,
could
tend
but
very
little
to
his
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
He
not
only
ordered
his
valet
de
chambre
to
exert
his
whole
address
,
in
order
to
discover
the
place
of
her
abode
,
but
this
dexterous
minister
,
who
was
very
well
acquainted
in
that
city
,
retained
half
a
dozen
of
noted
pimps
for
the
same
purpose
,
who
were
directed
to
employ
their
researches
for
a
very
handsome
young
lady
,
of
the
middle
stature
,
with
fine
black
eyes
,
and
teeth
as
white
as
snow
,
a
native
of
Brussels
,
though
married
to
a
French
gentleman
,
and
lately
arrived
from
her
husband
's
house
on
a
visit
to
her
mother
,
who
was
dangerously
ill
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
instructed
,
they
put
themselves
in
motion
,
while
the
lover
in
person
frequented
the
court
,
the
opera
,
the
churches
,
public
walks
,
and
every
place
where
he
thought
there
was
the
least
probability
of
seeing
her
.
<EOS>
The
description
his
Mercury
had
given
to
the
understrappers
of
gallantry
,
in
a
good
measure
suited
several
ladies
in
town
,
whom
Peregrine
found
means
to
see
,
in
consequence
of
the
reports
he
had
received
;
but
he
could
not
recognize
his
dear
fellow
-
traveller
among
the
number
.
<EOS>
At
last
one
of
his
terriers
gave
the
valet
de
chambre
to
understand
,
that
at
the
grate
of
a
certain
nunnery
,
he
had
observed
a
beautiful
young
creature
,
who
resembled
the
picture
he
had
drawn
,
and
that
upon
inquiry
,
he
found
she
had
not
taken
the
veil
;
but
her
mother
being
lately
dead
,
had
entered
as
a
pensionaire
,
until
her
family
-
affairs
could
be
adjusted
.
    
<EOS>
This
piece
of
intelligence
was
no
sooner
communicated
to
our
hero
,
than
he
flew
in
the
utmost
impatience
to
the
nunnery
,
and
,
without
allowing
himself
to
believe
that
this
boarder
could
be
any
other
than
the
object
of
his
pursuit
,
desired
the
portress
to
tell
the
young
lady
who
was
lately
admitted
,
that
one
of
her
relations
begg'd
to
speak
with
her
at
the
grate
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
not
waited
five
minutes
,
when
this
nymph
appeared
;
and
though
he
found
his
expectation
disappointed
,
he
was
so
struck
with
the
charms
of
this
new
figure
,
that
his
heart
throbbed
when
she
approached
;
and
after
he
had
asked
pardon
for
the
liberty
he
had
taken
,
and
explained
the
nature
of
his
mistake
,
he
could
not
help
telling
her
,
that
he
thought
himself
fortunate
in
the
misinformation
he
had
received
,
since
it
was
attended
with
the
pleasure
of
seeing
such
an
amiable
young
lady
.
<EOS>
To
this
compliment
she
replied
with
great
spirit
and
good
humour
,
that
encouraged
the
youth
to
continue
the
conversation
,
during
which
he
professed
himself
her
admirer
;
and
when
,
for
the
sake
of
decorum
,
he
was
obliged
to
take
his
leave
,
earnestly
begg'd
<EOS>
he
might
be
allow'd
to
repeat
his
visit
:
and
having
obtained
this
permission
,
and
the
knowledge
of
her
name
,
returned
to
his
lodgings
in
full
confidence
of
bringing
this
intrigue
to
a
prosperous
issue
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
had
the
young
gentleman
in
this
case
overrated
his
own
success
:
the
lady
happened
to
be
of
a
very
amorous
complexion
,
and
her
passions
being
inflamed
rather
than
mortified
,
by
the
restraint
in
which
she
lived
,
she
was
captivated
by
the
person
of
Peregrine
,
and
his
insinuating
address
had
confirmed
his
conquest
.
<EOS>
He
did
not
fail
to
be
at
the
grate
next
day
,
where
he
urged
his
suit
with
such
irresistible
recommendations
,
that
she
confessed
a
mutual
flame
,
after
having
observed
,
that
the
circumstances
of
her
situation
would
not
permit
her
to
protract
that
acknowledgment
in
the
usual
form
.
<EOS>
He
received
this
confession
with
transport
,
as
the
effusion
of
an
ingenuous
mind
,
that
soars
above
all
the
little
arts
and
disguises
of
the
sex
;
and
intreated
her
to
tell
him
when
or
where
he
should
have
the
happiness
of
conversing
with
her
,
without
the
interposition
of
these
invidious
bars
.
    
<EOS>
She
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
as
her
friends
had
put
her
under
the
direction
of
a
severe
abbess
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
go
abroad
without
the
connivance
of
the
portress
,
and
equally
impracticable
for
him
to
gain
admittance
into
the
convent
,
without
running
a
manifest
risk
of
being
discovered
,
and
consequently
punished
with
the
utmost
severity
.
    
<EOS>
When
a
fair
lady
was
in
the
case
,
our
adventurer
despised
all
danger
,
and
spared
no
expence
.
<EOS>
Thus
informed
,
he
studied
the
disposition
of
the
old
sister
who
kept
the
keys
;
and
in
her
appearance
and
conversation
,
distinguished
the
implacable
rancour
of
a
woman
who
had
spent
her
youth
in
all
the
mortification
of
detested
celibacy
.
<EOS>
She
bore
a
most
inveterate
grudge
to
all
her
juniors
,
who
still
remained
within
the
possibility
of
enjoying
those
pleasures
from
which
she
was
eternally
cut
off
,
and
observed
all
the
young
men
who
appeared
at
the
grate
with
the
most
envious
suspicion
.
<EOS>
Not
even
the
power
of
all
-
persuading
gold
could
tame
the
spite
,
or
soften
the
vigilant
asperity
of
this
indomitable
maiden
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
tampered
with
her
in
vain
;
nay
,
she
threatened
to
inform
the
abbess
of
his
sacrilegious
attempt
,
that
he
might
,
for
the
future
,
be
excluded
from
the
privilege
of
speaking
to
the
nuns
:
and
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
found
the
art
of
corruption
ineffectual
.
    
<EOS>
Baffled
in
this
endeavour
,
he
conferred
with
his
mistress
about
some
other
means
of
procuring
an
unrestricted
interview
;
and
she
,
in
the
fertility
of
her
invention
,
proposed
,
that
he
should
make
it
his
business
to
find
some
woman
,
who
,
by
her
acquaintance
in
the
convent
,
would
introduce
him
in
a
female
dress
,
as
a
stranger
desirous
of
seeing
the
oeconomy
of
the
house
.
<EOS>
The
expedient
was
wonderfully
relished
by
the
gallant
,
who
had
immediate
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
by
whom
he
was
next
day
made
acquainted
with
a
certain
good
-
natured
gentlewoman
,
who
,
for
an
handsome
consideration
,
undertook
the
task
.
<EOS>
From
this
good
lady
's
wardrobe
he
was
accordingly
accommodated
with
a
proper
suit
,
which
,
on
account
of
his
stature
,
was
pieced
for
the
purpose
:
and
his
mistress
being
previously
prepared
with
the
knowledge
of
their
intention
,
he
set
out
in
the
afternoon
with
his
conductress
,
who
had
interest
enough
to
obtain
his
admission
,
on
pretence
of
his
being
an
English
lady
,
just
arrived
from
her
own
country
,
and
curious
to
see
the
menage
and
accommodations
of
a
nunnery
.
<EOS>
Though
the
alteration
of
his
dress
,
and
a
pair
of
artificial
eye
-
brows
,
screened
him
from
the
penetrating
eye
of
the
portress
,
there
was
something
so
remarkably
singular
in
his
make
,
stature
,
countenance
and
mien
,
that
the
sisters
gazed
upon
him
as
a
prodigy
;
and
he
could
hear
them
,
as
he
passed
,
asking
of
each
other
,
with
expressions
of
astonishment
,
if
all
the
women
in
England
made
such
a
strange
appearance
.
    
<EOS>
Having
visited
the
cells
and
chapel
,
his
charmer
officiously
offered
her
service
in
conducting
the
stranger
to
the
garden
;
and
after
having
attended
them
in
walking
several
turns
,
invited
them
to
repose
in
a
small
arbour
,
that
stood
at
one
corner
,
in
the
middle
of
a
tuft
of
trees
,
which
rendered
it
impervious
to
the
view
.
    
<EOS>
The
old
gentlewoman
understanding
the
hint
,
accompanied
the
lovers
to
the
entrance
of
this
grove
,
where
she
left
them
,
on
pretence
of
being
still
unwearied
with
the
exercise
of
her
legs
;
and
their
mutual
raptures
in
this
stolen
interview
began
to
rise
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
,
when
they
were
alarmed
by
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
behind
them
;
and
turning
their
eyes
towards
the
place
,
perceived
they
were
discovered
by
a
nun
,
who
,
either
by
accident
or
design
,
had
concealed
herself
in
the
thicket
,
until
,
scandalized
by
their
behaviour
<EOS>
,
she
thought
it
high
time
to
signify
her
presence
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
our
hero
and
his
mistress
were
grievously
disconcerted
on
this
occasion
.
<EOS>
The
lady
cried
she
was
undone
,
and
had
almost
fainted
with
fear
,
which
was
not
at
all
without
foundation
,
considering
that
not
only
her
reputation
,
but
even
her
life
was
at
stake
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
could
easily
have
made
his
escape
over
the
garden
-
wall
,
had
too
much
gallantry
to
leave
his
charmer
and
friend
in
such
a
dangerous
dilemma
;
and
therefore
,
with
admirable
presence
of
mind
,
advanced
to
the
author
of
his
perplexity
,
and
without
any
ceremony
or
courtship
,
found
means
to
make
her
a
party
in
the
secret
,
before
she
could
recollect
herself
so
far
as
to
find
fault
with
his
proceeding
.
    
<EOS>
This
measure
re
-
established
the
tranquillity
of
the
scene
:
the
two
ladies
embraced
as
sisters
,
and
vowed
eternal
friendship
on
the
spot
;
and
the
young
gentleman
having
protested
that
he
would
share
his
affection
between
them
,
and
practise
the
same
method
of
visiting
them
in
a
few
days
,
rejoined
his
directress
,
and
returned
in
safety
to
his
own
lodgings
,
being
but
indifferently
satisfied
with
the
adventure
of
the
day
,
by
which
he
found
himself
obliged
,
either
to
forego
all
correspondence
with
the
woman
he
loved
,
or
carry
on
an
intrigue
with
a
person
who
was
not
at
all
to
his
liking
;
for
the
attractions
of
the
nun
were
by
no
means
inchanting
.
    
<EOS>
He
next
day
appeared
at
the
grate
in
his
own
person
,
and
intimated
his
sentiments
on
this
subject
to
his
mistress
,
who
assured
him
,
that
notwithstanding
her
behaviour
to
the
sister
,
in
the
emergency
of
yesterday
,
she
would
much
rather
be
debarred
of
his
company
for
ever
,
than
enjoy
it
upon
the
terms
which
necessity
had
obliged
him
to
propose
.
<EOS>
She
said
,
the
reflection
on
what
had
passed
in
the
grove
,
had
inspired
her
with
such
an
unconquerable
aversion
for
that
accidental
rival
,
that
she
could
not
think
of
her
without
hate
and
indignation
.
<EOS>
She
wished
she
had
run
all
risks
,
rather
than
submit
to
such
detested
partition
;
and
vowed
with
great
warmth
,
that
let
the
consequence
be
what
it
would
,
she
was
determined
to
discover
the
whole
affair
to
the
abbess
,
if
ever
he
should
introduce
himself
again
,
in
a
manner
which
must
subject
him
to
the
knowledge
and
claim
of
her
competitor
.
    
<EOS>
He
applauded
the
delicacy
of
her
sentiments
,
which
he
swore
were
exactly
conformable
to
his
own
;
and
promised
to
desist
from
those
visits
that
gave
her
umbrage
,
encouraging
her
to
hope
,
that
they
would
find
some
other
means
of
settling
an
intercourse
,
in
which
she
should
ingross
his
undivided
attention
.
<EOS>
Such
a
scheme
was
actually
the
subject
of
his
thoughts
at
that
time
;
and
a
youth
of
his
fruitful
imagination
,
assisted
with
the
counsels
of
such
a
consummate
politician
as
the
valet
de
chambre
,
would
undoubtedly
have
brought
it
to
maturation
,
had
not
his
aim
been
anticipated
by
an
unforeseen
accident
,
that
flowed
from
the
partial
administration
of
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
The
nun
who
had
been
indebted
to
chance
for
his
addresses
,
was
too
conscious
of
her
own
inferior
qualifications
,
to
think
she
could
dispute
the
heart
of
our
hero
with
the
young
lady
who
was
previously
possessed
of
his
affection
;
she
knew
,
that
her
share
of
his
good
graces
was
altogether
casual
,
and
that
the
continuance
of
his
assiduities
must
be
the
effect
of
policy
and
constrained
complaisance
;
yet
,
even
on
these
considerations
,
they
were
too
agreeable
to
be
given
up
;
and
therefore
she
resolved
to
guard
her
privilege
with
the
most
minute
vigilance
and
caution
.
<EOS>
Jealousy
was
the
natural
consequence
of
these
suggestions
:
the
assignation
in
the
garden
,
she
knew
,
must
have
been
preceded
by
some
communication
;
and
as
there
was
no
other
opportunity
of
conversing
with
the
male
sex
,
except
that
of
holding
a
conference
through
the
grate
,
she
went
to
the
portress
,
with
a
view
of
obtaining
some
intelligence
;
and
pumped
the
beldame
so
successfully
,
that
she
learnt
how
her
rival
had
that
very
forenoon
been
favoured
with
a
visit
by
a
young
gentleman
,
whom
she
supposed
to
be
no
other
than
their
common
gallant
.
<EOS>
Inflamed
with
this
information
,
she
taxed
the
young
lady
with
double
dealing
;
and
scolded
with
such
bitterness
,
that
the
other
,
already
prejudiced
against
her
pretensions
,
could
no
longer
contain
her
resentment
,
which
she
uttered
in
contemptuous
sneers
against
her
personal
attributes
;
and
in
the
pride
of
her
wrath
declared
,
that
she
ought
not
to
expect
another
interview
with
her
lover
in
the
grove
;
for
he
was
already
too
much
satiated
with
her
charms
to
return
to
such
a
banquet
,
and
had
relinquished
her
to
the
chance
of
meeting
with
another
charitable
meal
.
    
<EOS>
No
tygress
robbed
of
her
young
was
ever
exalted
to
an
higher
pitch
of
fury
than
this
nun
,
when
she
found
herself
abandoned
by
her
lover
,
and
insulted
in
this
mortifying
explanation
.
<EOS>
She
darted
upon
her
antagonist
,
like
a
hawk
upon
a
partridge
,
and
with
her
nails
disfigured
that
fair
face
which
had
defrauded
her
of
her
dearest
expectation
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
rival
tamely
bear
the
barbarity
of
her
rage
;
what
she
wanted
in
strength
she
supplied
with
spirit
,
and
twisting
her
hand
in
the
hair
of
the
aggressor
,
pulled
her
head
with
violence
to
the
ground
.
<EOS>
The
noise
of
this
contention
,
increased
by
the
cries
of
the
combatants
,
whose
tongues
were
more
active
than
their
hands
,
brought
a
croud
of
sisters
to
the
spot
;
but
so
fiercely
were
they
engaged
,
that
they
neither
minded
admonitions
nor
threats
,
nor
paid
the
least
regard
to
their
own
reputation
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
as
if
they
had
not
known
that
they
were
surrounded
by
numbers
,
who
heard
every
word
that
proceeded
from
their
mouths
,
they
made
no
secret
of
the
cause
of
their
dispute
,
which
,
in
the
precipitancy
of
their
wrath
,
they
divulged
with
all
its
circumstances
,
to
the
amazement
of
the
by
-
standers
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
the
lady
abbess
arrived
,
and
what
her
authority
could
not
accomplish
,
was
effected
by
two
lay
-
sisters
,
who
being
summoned
for
the
purpose
,
separated
the
rivals
,
who
were
by
this
time
quite
exhausted
with
the
fatigue
of
the
battle
.
<EOS>
Had
this
mutual
detection
been
made
in
any
company
of
females
,
the
secret
would
have
hardly
rested
among
those
who
heard
it
,
much
less
in
a
convent
,
where
so
many
old
maidens
happened
to
be
present
.
    
<EOS>
One
of
these
antiquated
devotees
accordingly
imparted
it
to
the
superior
,
who
having
examined
into
the
particulars
,
and
found
the
information
true
,
from
the
rash
recrimination
of
the
incensed
parties
on
their
trial
,
considered
the
affair
as
a
very
serious
matter
,
which
affected
the
good
order
and
reputation
of
her
convent
,
assembled
all
the
sisters
,
and
exhorted
them
to
suppress
the
discovery
,
as
a
circumstance
injurious
to
the
character
of
the
house
;
laid
strict
injunctions
on
the
portress
,
to
be
very
cautious
for
the
future
in
the
discharge
of
her
office
,
delivered
over
the
backsliding
nun
to
a
severe
penance
prescribed
by
her
ghostly
father
,
and
that
very
day
sent
her
boarder
back
to
her
relations
,
with
a
hint
of
what
had
happened
,
and
an
advice
to
dispose
of
her
in
some
remote
nunnery
,
where
she
would
be
less
exposed
to
the
machinations
of
her
gallant
.
    
<EOS>
Our
lover
,
utterly
ignorant
of
this
unlucky
fray
and
its
consequence
,
was
confounded
when
the
wrinkled
turnkey
refused
to
admit
him
to
the
grate
,
telling
him
,
that
his
impious
contrivance
had
come
to
light
;
that
the
lewd
young
woman
,
for
whose
sake
he
had
been
guilty
of
such
a
flagrant
crime
,
was
banished
from
the
convent
;
and
that
if
ever
he
should
make
another
attempt
to
disturb
the
tranquillity
of
their
retreat
,
a
formal
complaint
would
be
preferred
against
him
to
the
civil
magistrate
.
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
with
this
reception
<EOS>
,
he
did
not
think
proper
to
advance
any
thing
in
his
own
vindication
,
but
retreated
with
all
convenient
dispatch
,
not
ill
pleased
at
the
issue
of
an
adventure
which
might
have
proved
not
only
disagreeable
,
but
dangerous
in
the
highest
degree
.
    
<EOS>
He
at
once
conjectured
,
that
the
mutual
jealousy
of
the
ladies
had
betrayed
the
intrigue
;
and
imagined
,
that
now
his
charmer
was
delivered
from
the
restrictions
of
a
convent
,
she
would
be
more
accessible
to
his
endeavours
.
<EOS>
On
this
supposition
,
he
sent
his
couriers
upon
the
scout
;
and
as
he
knew
her
name
,
it
was
not
long
before
he
learnt
,
from
their
artful
inquiries
,
that
immediately
after
her
dismission
from
one
nunnery
,
she
had
been
entered
in
another
at
Ghent
,
in
consequence
of
the
superior
's
advice
,
and
in
all
likelihood
would
be
compelled
to
take
the
veil
by
her
guardians
,
who
were
remarkably
zealous
for
the
welfare
of
her
soul
.

Chapter
LXVII
<EOS>
The
travellers
depart
for
Antwerp
,
at
which
place
the
painter
gives
a
loose
to
his
enthusiasm
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
thus
deprived
of
an
agreeable
correspondence
,
and
baffled
in
all
his
efforts
to
retrieve
the
other
object
of
his
passion
,
yielded
at
length
to
the
remonstrances
of
his
governor
and
fellow
-
travellers
,
who
,
out
of
pure
complaisance
to
him
,
had
exceeded
their
intended
stay
by
six
days
at
least
:
and
a
couple
of
post
-
chaises
,
with
three
riding
-
horses
,
being
hired
,
they
departed
from
Brussels
in
the
morning
,
dined
at
Mechlin
,
and
arrived
about
eight
in
the
evening
at
the
venerable
city
of
Antwerp
.
<EOS>
During
this
day
's
journey
,
Pallet
was
elevated
to
an
uncommon
flow
of
spirits
,
with
the
prospect
of
seeing
the
birth
place
of
Rubens
,
for
whom
he
professed
an
enthusiastic
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
He
swore
,
that
the
pleasure
he
felt
was
equal
to
that
of
a
Mussulman
,
on
the
last
day
of
his
pilgrimage
to
Mecca
;
and
that
he
already
considered
himself
a
native
of
Antwerp
,
being
so
intimately
acqainted
with
their
so
justly
boasted
citizen
,
from
whom
,
at
certain
junctures
,
he
could
not
help
believing
himself
derived
,
because
his
own
pencil
adopted
the
manner
of
that
great
man
with
surprising
facility
,
and
his
face
wanted
nothing
but
a
pair
of
whiskers
and
a
beard
to
exhibit
the
express
image
of
the
Fleming
's
countenance
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
,
he
was
so
proud
of
this
resemblance
,
that
in
order
to
render
it
more
striking
,
he
had
at
one
time
of
his
life
resolved
to
keep
his
face
sacred
from
the
razor
;
and
in
that
purpose
had
persevered
,
notwithstanding
the
continual
reprehensions
of
Mrs
Pallet
,
who
being
then
with
child
,
said
,
his
aspect
was
so
hideous
,
that
she
dreaded
a
miscarriage
every
hour
,
until
she
threatened
,
in
plain
terms
,
to
dispute
the
sanity
of
his
intellects
,
and
apply
to
the
chancellor
for
a
committee
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
on
this
occasion
observed
,
that
a
man
who
is
not
proof
against
the
solicitations
of
a
woman
,
can
never
expect
to
make
a
great
figure
in
life
;
that
painters
and
poets
ought
to
cultivate
no
wives
but
the
muses
;
or
if
they
are
,
by
the
accidents
of
fortune
,
incumbered
with
families
,
they
should
carefully
guard
against
that
pernicious
weakness
,
falsely
honoured
with
the
appellation
of
natural
affection
,
and
pay
no
manner
of
regard
to
the
impertinent
customs
of
the

Granting

Sophocles
himself

that
celebrated
tragic
poet
,
who
for
the
sweetness
of
his
versification
,
was
stiled
melitta
,
or
the
bee
<EOS>
,
in
his
old
age
suffered
the

accusation
from
his
own
children
,
who
seeing
him
neglect
his
family
affairs
,
and
devote
himself
intirely
to
poetry
,
carried
him
before
the
magistrate
,
as
a
man
whose

were
so
much
impaired
by
the
infirmities
of
age
,
that
he
was
no
longer
fit
to
manage
his

upon
which
the
reverend

produced
his
tragedy

as
a
work
he
had
just
finished

which
being
perused
,
instead

being
declared
unsound
of

he
was
dismissed
with
admiration

"
<EOS>
The
painter
,
stung
with
this
sarcasm
,
replied
,
"
or
like
those
Virtuosi
,
who
by
repeating
Greek
,
eating
sillikickaby

and

equal
the
ancients
in
taste
and
genius
.
<EOS>
"
The
physician
retorted
,
Pallet
rejoined
,
and
the
altercation
continued
,
until
they
entered
the
gates
of
Antwerp
,
when
the
admirer
of
Rubens
broke
forth
into
a
rapturous
exclamation
,
which
put
an
end
to
the
dispute
,
and
attracted
the
notice
of
the
inhabitants
,
many
of
whom
,
by
shrugging
up
their
shoulders
,
and
pointing
to
their
foreheads
,
gave
shrewd
indications
,
that
they
believed
him
a
poor
gentleman
disordered
in
his
brain
.
    
<EOS>
They
had
no
sooner
alighted
at
the
inn
,
than
this
pseudo
-
enthusiast
proposed
to
visit
the
great
church
,
in
which
he
had
been
informed
some
of
his
master
's
pieces
were
to
be
seen
;
and
was
remarkably
chagrined
,
when
he
understood
that
he
could
not
be
admitted
till
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
He
rose
next
morning
by
day
-
break
,
and
disturbed
his
fellow
-
travellers
travellers
in
such
a
noisy
and
clamorous
manner
,
that
Peregrine
determined
to
punish
him
with
some
new
infliction
,
and
while
he
put
on
his
cloaths
,
actually
formed
the
plan
of
promoting
a
duel
between
him
and
the
doctor
;
in
the
management
of
which
he
promised
himself
store
of
entertainment
,
from
the
behaviour
of
both
.
    
<EOS>
Being
provided
with
one
of
those
domestics
who
are
always
in
waiting
to
offer
their
services
to
strangers
on
their
first
arrival
,
they
were
conducted
to
the
house
of
a
gentleman
who
had
an
excellent
collection
of
pictures
;
and
though
the
greatest
part
of
them
were
painted
by
his
favourite
artist
,
Pallet
condemned
them
all
by
the
lump
,
because
Pickle
had
told
him
beforehand
,
that
there
was
not
one
performance
of
Rubens
among
the
number
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
place
they
visited
,
was
what
is
called
the
academy
of
painting
,
furnished
with
a
number
of
paultry
pieces
,
in
which
our
painter
recognized
the
stile
of
Peter
Paul
,
with
many
expressions
of
admiration
,
on
,
the
same
sort
of
previous
intelligence
.
    
<EOS>
From
this
repository
they
went
to
the
great
church
,
and
being
led
to
the
tomb
of
Rubens
,
the
whimsical
painter
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
worshipped
,
with
such
appearance
of
devotion
,
that
the
attendant
,
scandalized
at
his
superstition
,
pulled
him
up
,
observing
with
great
warmth
,
that
the
person
buried
in
that
place
was
no
saint
,
but
as
great
a
sinner
as
himself
;
and
that
if
he
was
spiritually
disposed
,
there
was
a
chapel
of
the
Blessed
Virgin
,
at
the
distance
of
three
yards
on
the
right
hand
,
to
which
he
might
retire
.
    
<EOS>
He
thought
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
manifest
some
extraordinary
inspiration
,
while
he
resided
on
the
spot
where
Rubens
was
born
;
and
therefore
,
his
whole
behaviour
was
an
affectation
of
rapture
,
expressed
in
distracted
exclamations
,
convulsive
starts
,
and
uncouth
gesticulations
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
frantic
behaviour
,
he
saw
an
old
Capuchin
,
with
a
white
beard
,
mount
the
pulpit
,
and
hold
forth
to
the
congregation
with
such
violence
of
emphasis
and
gesture
,
as
captivated
his
fancy
;
and
bawling
aloud
,
"
Zounds
!
<EOS>
what
an
excellent
Paul
preaching
at
Athens
!
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
he
pulled
a
pencil
and
small
memorandum
-
book
from
his
pocket
,
and
began
to
take
a
sketch
of
the
orator
,
with
great
eagerness
and
agitation
,
saying
,
"
Egad
!
friend
Raphael
,
we
shall
see
whether
you
or
I
have
got
the
best
knack
at
trumping
up
an
Apostle
.
"
<EOS>
This
appearance
of
disrespect
gave
offence
to
the
audience
,
which
began
to
murmur
against
this
heretic
libertine
;
when
one
of
the
priests
belonging
to
the
choir
,
in
order
to
prevent
any
ill
consequence
from
their
displeasure
,
came
and
told
him
in
the
French
language
,
that
such
liberties
were
not
permitted
in
their
religion
,
and
advised
him
to
lay
aside
his
implements
,
lest
the
people
should
take
umbrage
at
his
design
,
and
be
provoked
to
punish
him
as
a
profane
scoffer
at
their
worship
.
    
<EOS>
The
painter
seeing
himself
addressed
by
a
friar
,
who
,
while
he
spoke
,
bowed
with
great
complaisance
,
imagined
that
he
was
a
begging
brother
come
to
supplicate
his
charity
;
and
his
attention
being
quite
ingrossed
by
the
design
he
was
making
,
he
patted
the
priest
's
shaven
crown
with
his
hand
,
saying
,
Oter
tems
,
oter
tems
;
and
then
resumed
his
pencil
with
great
earnestness
.
    
<EOS>
The
ecclesiastic
perceiving
that
the
stranger
did
not
comprehend
his
meaning
,
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
,
and
explained
himself
in
the
Latin
tongue
:
upon
which
,
Pallet
,
provoked
at
his
intrusion
,
cursed
him
aloud
for
an
impudent
beggarly
son
of
a
whore
;
and
taking
out
a
schelling
,
flung
it
upon
the
pavement
,
with
manifest
signs
of
indignation
.
    
<EOS>
Some
of
the
common
people
,
enraged
to
see
their
religion
contemned
,
and
their
priests
insulted
at
the
very
altar
,
rose
from
their
seats
,
and
surrounding
the
astonished
painter
,
one
of
the
number
snatched
his
book
from
his
hand
,
and
tore
it
into
a
thousand
pieces
.
<EOS>
Frightened
as
he
was
,
he
could
not
help
crying
,
"
Fire
and
faggots
!
<EOS>
all
my
favourite
ideas
are
gone
to
wreck
!
"
<EOS>
and
was
in
danger
of
being
very
roughly
handled
by
the
croud
,
had
not
Peregrine
stepped
in
,
and
assured
them
,
that
he
was
a
poor
unhappy
gentleman
,
who
laboured
under
a
transport
of
the
brain
.
<EOS>
Those
who
understood
the
French
language
communicated
this
information
to
the
rest
;
so
that
he
escaped
without
any
other
chastisement
,
than
that
of
being
obliged
to
retire
.
<EOS>
And
as
they
could
not
see
the
famous
descent
from
the
cross
till
after
the
service
was
finished
,
they
were
conducted
by
their
domestique
to
the
house
of
a
painter
,
where
they
found
a
beggar
standing
for
his
picture
,
and
the
artist
actually
employed
in
representing
a
huge
louse
that
crawled
upon
his
shoulder
.
    
<EOS>
Pallet
was
wonderfully
pleased
with
this
circumstance
,
which
he
said
was
altogether
a
new
thought
,
and
an
excellent
hint
,
of
which
he
would
make
his
advantage
:
<EOS>
and
in
the
course
of
his
survey
of
this
Fleming
's
performances
,
perceiving
a
piece
in
which
two
flies
were
engaged
upon
the
carcase
of
a
dog
half
devoured
,
he
ran
to
his
brother
brush
,
and
swore
he
was
worthy
of
being
a
fellow
-
citizen
of
the
immortal
Rubens
.
<EOS>
He
then
lamented
,
with
many
expressions
of
grief
and
resentment
,
that
he
had
lost
his
common
-
place
-
book
,
in
which
he
had
preserved
a
thousand
conceptions
of
the
same
sort
,
formed
by
the
accidental
objects
of
his
senses
and
imagination
;
and
took
an
opportunity
of
telling
his
fellow
-
travellers
,
that
in
execution
he
had
equalled
,
if
not
excelled
,
the
two
ancient
painters
who
vied
with
each
other
in
the
representation
of
a
curtain
and
a
bunch
of
grapes
;
for
he
had
exhibited
the
image
of
a
certain
object
so
like
to
nature
,
that
the
bare
sight
of
it
set
a
whole
hog
-
sty
in
an
uproar
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
had
examined
and
applauded
all
the
productions
of
this
minute
artist
,
they
returned
to
the
great
church
,
and
were
entertained
with
the
view
of
that
celebrated
master
-
piece
of
Rubens
,
in
which
he
has
introduced
the
portraits
of
himself
and
his
whole
family
.
<EOS>
The
doors
that
conceal
this
capital
performance
were
no
sooner
unfolded
,
than
our
enthusiast
,
debarred
the
use
of
speech
,
by
a
previous
covenant
with
his
friend
Pickle
,
lifted
up
his
hands
and
eyes
,
and
putting
himself
in
the
attitude
of
Hamlet
,
when
his
father
's
ghost
appears
,
adored
in
silent
extasy
and
awe
.
<EOS>
He
even
made
a
merit
of
necessity
;
and
when
they
had
withdrawn
from
the
place
,
protested
that
his
whole
faculties
were
swallowed
up
in
love
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
He
now
professed
himself
more
than
ever
enamoured
of
the
Flemish
school
,
raved
in
extravagant
encomiums
,
and
proposed
,
that
the
whole
company
should
pay
homage
to
the
memory
of
the
divine
Rubens
,
by
repairing
forthwith
to
the
house
in
which
he
lived
,
and
prostrating
themselves
on
the
floor
of
his
painting
room
.
    
<EOS>
As
there
was
nothing
remarkable
in
the
tenement
,
which
had
been
rebuilt
more
than
once
since
the
death
of
that
great
man
,
Peregrine
excused
himself
from
complying
with
the
proposal
,
on
pretence
of
being
fatigued
with
the
circuit
they
had
already
performed
.
<EOS>
Jolter
declined
it
for
the
same
reason
;
and
the
question
being
put
to
the
doctor
,
he
refused
his
company
with
an
air
of
disdain
.
<EOS>
Pallet
,
piqued
at
his
contemptuous
manner
,
asked
if
he
would
not
go
and
see
the
habitation
of
Pindoor
,
provided
he
was
in
the
city
where
that
poet
lived
?
<EOS>
And
when
the
physician
observed
,
that
there
was
an
infinite
difference
between
the
men
;
"
That
I
'll
allow
,
(
replied
the
painter
)
for
the
devil
a
poet
ever
lived
in
Greece
or
Troy
,
that
was
worthy
to
clean
the
pencils
of
our
beloved
Rubens
.
<EOS>
"
The
physician
could
not
with
any
degree
of
temper
and
forbearance
hear
this
outrageous
blasphemy
,
for
which
,
he
said
,
Pallet
's
eyes
ought
to
be
picked
out
by
owls
:
and
the
dispute
rose
,
as
usual
,
to
such
scurrilities
of
language
and
indecency
of
behaviour
,
that
passengers
began
to
take
notice
of
their
animosity
;
and
Peregrine
was
obliged
to
interpose
,
for
his
own
credit
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXVIII
Peregrine
artfully
foments
a
quarrel
between
Pallet
and
the
physician
,
who
fight
a
duel
on
the
ramparts
.
   
<EOS>
The
painter
betook
himself
to
the
house
of
the
Flemish
Raphael
,
and
the
rest
of
the
company
went
back
to
their
lodgings
;
where
the
young
gentleman
,
taking
the
advantage
of
being
alone
with
the
physician
,
recapitulated
all
the
affronts
he
had
sustained
from
the
painter
's
petulance
,
aggravating
every
circumstance
of
the
disgrace
,
and
advising
him
,
in
the
capacity
of
a
friend
,
to
take
care
of
his
honour
,
which
could
not
fail
to
suffer
in
the
opinion
of
the
world
,
if
he
allowed
himself
to
be
insulted
with
impunity
,
by
one
so
much
his
inferior
in
every
degree
of
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
The
physician
assured
him
,
that
Pallet
had
hitherto
escaped
chastisement
,
by
being
deemed
an
object
unworthy
his
resentment
,
and
in
consideration
of
the
wretch
's
family
,
for
which
his
compassion
was
interested
;
but
,
that
repeated
injuries
would
inflame
the
most
benevolent
disposition
:
and
although
he
could
find
no
precedent
of
duelling
among
the
Greeks
and
Romans
,
whom
he
considered
as
the
patterns
of
demeanour
,
Pallet
should
no
longer
avail
himself
of
his
veneration
for
the
ancients
,
but
be
punished
for
the
very
next
offence
he
should
commit
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
spirited
up
the
doctor
to
a
resolution
from
which
he
could
not
decently
swerve
,
our
adventurer
acted
the
incendiary
with
the
other
party
also
;
giving
him
to
understand
,
that
the
physician
treated
his
character
with
such
contempt
,
and
behaved
to
him
with
such
insolence
,
as
no
gentleman
ought
to
bear
:
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
was
every
day
put
out
of
countenance
by
their
mutual
animosity
,
which
appeared
in
nothing
but
vulgar
expressions
,
more
becoming
shoe
-
boys
and
oyster
-
women
than
men
of
honour
and
education
;
and
therefore
he
should
be
obliged
,
contrary
to
his
inclination
,
to
break
off
all
correspondence
with
them
both
,
if
they
would
not
fall
upon
some
method
to
retrieve
the
dignity
of
their
characters
.
    
<EOS>
These
representations
would
have
had
little
effect
upon
the
timidity
of
the
painter
,
who
was
likewise
too
much
of
a
Grecian
to
approve
of
single
combat
,
in
any
other
way
than
that
of
boxing
,
an
exercise
in
which
he
was
well
skill'd
,
had
not
they
been
accompanied
with
an
insinuation
,
that
his
antagonist
was
no
Hector
,
and
that
he
might
humble
him
into
any
concession
,
without
running
the
least
personal
risk
.
<EOS>
Animated
by
this
assurance
,
our
second
Rubens
set
the
trumpet
of
defiance
to
his
mouth
,
swore
that
he
valued
not
his
life
a
rush
,
when
his
honour
was
concerned
,
and
intreated
Mr
Pickle
to
be
the
bearer
of
a
challenge
,
which
he
would
instantly
commit
to
writing
.
    
<EOS>
The
mischievous
fomentor
highly
applauded
this
manifestation
of
courage
,
by
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
cultivate
his
friendship
and
society
;
but
declined
the
office
of
carrying
the
billet
,
that
his
tenderness
of
Pallet
's
reputation
might
not
be
misinterpreted
into
an
officious
desire
of
promoting
quarrels
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
recommended
Tom
Pipes
,
not
only
as
a
very
proper
messenger
on
this
occasion
,
but
also
as
a
trusty
second
in
the
field
.
    
<EOS>
The
magnanimous
painter
took
his
advice
,
and
retiring
to
his
chamber
,
penn'd
a
challenge
in
these
terms
.

,
When
I
am
heartily
provoked
,
I
fear
not
the
devil
himself
;
much
less
 
<EOS>
I
will
not
call
you
a
pedantic
coxcomb
,
nor
an
unmannerly
fellow
,
because
these
are
the
hippythets
of
the
wulgar
:
but
,
remember
,
such
as
you
are
,
I
neyther
love
you
nor
fear
you
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
expect
satisfaction
for
your
audacious
behaviour
to
me
,
on
divers
occasions
;
and
will
,
this
evening
,
in
the
twilight
,
meet
you
on
the
ramparts
with
sword
and
pistol
,
where
the
Lord
have
mercy
on
the
soul
of
one
of
us
;
for
your
body
shall
find
no
favour
with
your
incensed
defier
,
till
death
,
 
Layman
Pallet
.
    
<EOS>
This
resolute
defiance
,
after
having
been
submitted
to
the
perusal
,
and
honoured
with
the
approbation
of
our
youth
,
was
committed
to
the
charge
of
Pipes
,
who
,
according
to
his
orders
,
delivered
it
in
the
afternoon
;
and
brought
for
answer
,
that
the
physician
would
attend
him
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
The
challenger
was
evidently
discomposed
at
the
unexpected
news
of
this
acceptance
,
and
ran
about
the
house
in
great
disorder
,
in
quest
of
Peregrine
,
to
beg
his
further
advice
and
assistance
;
but
,
understanding
that
the
youth
was
engaged
in
private
with
his
adversary
,
he
began
to
suspect
some
collusion
,
and
cursed
himself
for
his
folly
and
precipitation
.
    
<EOS>
He
even
entertained
some
thoughts
of
retracting
his
invitation
,
and
submitting
to
the
triumph
of
his
antagonist
:
<EOS>
but
,
before
he
would
stoop
to
this
opprobrious
condescension
,
he
resolved
to
try
another
expedient
,
which
might
be
the
means
of
saving
both
his
character
and
person
.
<EOS>
In
this
hope
he
visited
Mr
Jolter
,
and
very
gravely
desired
he
would
be
so
good
as
to
undertake
the
office
of
his
second
,
in
a
duel
which
he
was
to
fight
that
evening
with
the
physician
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
,
instead
of
answering
his
expectation
,
in
expressing
fear
and
concern
,
and
breaking
forth
into
exclamations
of
,
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
gentlemen
,
what
d'ye
mean
?
<EOS>
You
shall
not
murther
one
another
,
while
it
is
in
my
power
to
prevent
your
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
will
go
directly
to
the
governor
of
the
place
,
who
shall
interpose
his
authority
.
<EOS>
"
I
say
,
instead
of
these
and
other
friendly
menaces
of
prevention
,
Jolter
heard
the
proposal
with
the
most
phlegmatic
tranquillity
,
and
excused
himself
from
accepting
the
honour
he
intended
for
him
,
on
account
of
his
character
and
situation
,
which
would
not
permit
him
to
be
concerned
in
any
such
rencounters
.
<EOS>
Indeed
this
mortifying
reception
was
owing
to
a
previous
hint
from
Peregrine
,
who
dreading
some
sort
of
interruption
from
his
governor
,
had
made
him
acquainted
with
his
design
,
and
assured
him
,
that
the
affair
should
not
be
brought
to
any
dangerous
issue
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
disappointed
,
the
dejected
challenger
was
overwhelmed
with
perplexity
and
dismay
;
and
in
the
terrors
of
death
or
mutilitation
,
resolved
to
deprecate
the
wrath
of
his
enemy
,
and
conform
to
any
submission
he
should
propose
;
when
he
was
accidentally
encountered
by
our
adventurer
,
who
with
demonstrations
of
infinite
satisfaction
,
told
him
in
confidence
,
that
his
billet
had
thrown
the
doctor
into
an
agony
of
consternation
;
and
that
his
acceptance
of
his
challenge
was
a
meer
effort
of
despair
,
calculated
to
confound
the
ferocity
of
the
sender
,
and
dispose
him
to
listen
to
terms
of
accommodation
:
that
he
had
imparted
the
letter
to
him
with
fear
and
trembling
,
on
pretence
of
engaging
him
as
a
second
,
but
in
reality
,
with
a
view
of
obtaining
his
good
offices
in
promoting
a
reconciliation
;
"
but
,
perceiving
the
situation
of
his
mind
,
(
added
our
hero
)
<EOS>
I
thought
it
would
be
more
for
your
honour
to
baffle
his
expectation
;
and
therefore
I
readily
undertook
the
task
of
attending
him
to
the
field
,
in
full
assurance
,
that
he
will
there
humble
himself
before
you
,
even
to
prostration
.
<EOS>
In
this
security
,
you
may
go
and
prepare
your
arms
,
and
bespeak
the
assistance
of
Pipes
,
who
will
squire
you
in
the
field
,
while
I
keep
myself
up
,
that
our
correspondence
may
not
be
suspected
by
the
physician
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Pallet
's
spirits
,
that
were
sunk
to
dejection
,
rose
at
this
encouragement
to
all
the
insolence
of
triumph
;
he
again
declared
his
contempt
of
danger
,
and
his
pistols
being
loaded
and
accommodated
with
new
flints
,
by
his
trusty
armour
-
bearer
,
he
waited
,
without
flinching
,
for
the
hour
of
battle
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
first
approach
of
twilight
,
somebody
knocked
at
his
door
,
and
Pipes
having
opened
it
at
his
desire
,
he
heard
the
voice
of
his
antagonist
pronounce
,
"
Tell
Mr
Pallet
,
that
I
am
going
to
the
place
of
appointment
.
<EOS>
"
The
painter
was
not
a
little
surprized
at
this
anticipation
,
which
so
ill
agreed
with
the
information
he
had
received
from
Pickle
;
and
his
concern
beginning
to
recur
,
he
fortified
himself
with
a
large
bumper
of
brandy
,
which
,
however
,
did
not
overcome
the
anxiety
of
his
thoughts
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
set
out
on
the
expedition
with
his
second
,
betwixt
whom
and
himself
<EOS>
the
following
dialogue
passed
,
in
their
way
to
the
ramparts
.
"
<EOS>
Mr
Pipes
,
(
said
the
painter
,
with
disordered
accent
)
methinks
the
doctor
was
in
a
pestilent
hurry
with
that
message
of
his
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ey
,
ey
,
(
answered
Tom
)
<EOS>
I
do
suppose
he
longs
to
be
foul
of
you
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
(
replied
the
other
)
d'ye
<EOS>
think
he
thirsts
after
my
blood
?
"
<EOS>
"
To
be
sure
a
does
,
"
(
said
Pipes
,
thrusting
a
large
quid
of
tobacco
in
his
cheek
,
with
great
deliberation
.
)
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
,
(
cried
Pallet
,
beginning
to
shake
)
he
is
no
better
than
a
Cannibal
,
and
no
Christian
ought
to
fight
him
on
equal
footing
.
"
<EOS>
Tom
observing
his
emotion
,
eyed
him
with
a
frown
of
indignation
,
saying
,
"
You
an't
afraid
,
are
you
?
"
<EOS>
"
God
forbid
!
<EOS>
(
replied
the
challenger
,
stammering
with
fear
.
)
<EOS>
What
should
I
be
afraid
of
?
<EOS>
The
worst
he
can
do
,
is
to
take
my
life
,
and
then
he
'll
be
answerable
both
to
God
and
man
for
the
murder
:
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
think
he
will
?
"
<EOS>
"
I
think
no
such
matter
,
(
answered
the
second
)
if
so
be
as
how
he
puts
a
brace
of
bullets
through
your
bows
,
and
kills
you
fairly
,
it
is
no
more
murder
than
if
I
was
to
bring
down
a
noddy
from
the
main
-
top
-
sail
-
yard
.
<EOS>
"
By
this
time
,
Pallet
's
teeth
chattered
with
such
violence
,
that
he
could
scarce
pronounce
this
reply
,
"
Mr
Thomas
,
you
seem
to
make
very
light
of
a
man
's
life
;
but
I
trust
in
the
Almighty
,
I
shall
not
be
so
easily
brought
down
.
<EOS>
Sure
many
a
man
has
fought
a
duel
,
without
losing
his
life
.
<EOS>
Do
you
imagine
that
I
run
such
a
hazard
of
falling
by
the
hand
of
my
adversary
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
may
,
or
you
may
not
,
(
said
the
unconcerned
Pipes
)
just
as
it
happens
.
<EOS>
What
then
?
    
<EOS>
Death
is
a
debt
that
every
man
owes
,
according
to
the
song
;
and
if
you
set
foot
to
foot
,
I
think
one
of
you
must
go
to
pot
.
"
<EOS>
"
Foot
to
foot
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
terrified
painter
)
<EOS>
that
's
downright
butchery
;
and
I
'll
be
damn'd
<EOS>
before
I
fight
any
man
on
earth
in
such
a
barbarous
way
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
d'ye
<EOS>
take
me
to
be
a
savage
beast
?
<EOS>
"
This
declaration
he
made
while
they
ascended
the
ramparts
;
and
his
attendant
perceiving
the
physician
and
his
second
at
the
distance
of
an
hundred
paces
before
them
,
gave
him
notice
of
their
appearance
,
and
advised
him
to
make
ready
,
and
behave
like
a
man
.
<EOS>
Pallet
in
vain
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
pannic
,
which
discovered
itself
in
an
universal
trepidation
of
body
,
and
the
lamentable
tone
in
which
he
answered
this
exhortation
of
Pipes
;
<EOS>
saying
,
"
I
do
behave
like
a
man
;
but
you
would
have
me
act
the
part
of
a
brute
.
<EOS>
Are
they
coming
this
way
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
When
Tom
told
him
that
they
had
faced
about
,
and
admonished
him
to
advance
,
the
nerves
of
his
arm
refused
their
office
,
he
could
not
hold
out
his
pistol
,
and
instead
of
going
forward
,
retreated
with
an
insensibility
of
motion
;
till
Pipes
,
placing
himself
in
the
rear
,
set
his
own
back
to
that
of
his
principal
,
and
swore
he
should
not
budge
an
inch
farther
in
that
direction
.
    
<EOS>
While
the
valet
thus
tutored
the
painter
,
his
master
enjoyed
the
terrors
of
the
physician
,
which
were
more
ridiculous
than
those
of
Pallet
,
because
he
was
more
intent
upon
disguising
them
.
    
<EOS>
His
declaration
to
Pickle
in
the
morning
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
start
any
objections
when
he
received
the
challenge
;
and
finding
that
the
young
gentleman
made
no
offer
of
mediating
the
affair
,
but
rather
congratulated
him
on
the
occasion
,
when
he
communicated
the
painter
's
billet
,
all
his
efforts
consisted
in
oblique
hints
,
and
general
reflections
upon
the
absurdity
of
duelling
,
which
was
first
introduced
among
civilized
nations
,
by
the
barbarous
Huns
and
Longobards
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
pretended
to
ridicule
the
use
of
fire
-
arms
,
which
confounded
all
the
distinctions
of
skill
and
address
,
and
deprived
a
combatant
of
the
opportunity
of
signalizing
his
personal
prowess
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
assented
to
the
justness
of
his
observations
;
but
at
the
same
time
represented
the
necessity
of
complying
with
the
customs
of
the
world
,
(
ridiculous
as
they
were
)
on
which
a
man
's
honour
and
reputation
depend
.
<EOS>
So
that
,
seeing
no
hopes
of
profiting
by
that
artifice
,
the
republican
's
agitation
became
more
and
more
remarkable
;
and
he
proposed
in
plain
terms
,
that
they
should
contend
in
armour
,
like
the
combatants
of
ancient
days
;
for
it
was
but
reasonable
,
that
they
should
practise
the
manner
of
fighting
,
since
they
adopted
the
disposition
of
those
iron
times
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
could
have
afforded
more
diversion
to
our
hero
,
than
the
sight
of
two
such
duellists
cased
in
iron
;
and
he
wished
that
he
had
promoted
the
quarrel
in
Brussels
,
where
he
could
have
hired
the
armour
of
Charles
the
fifth
,
and
the
valiant
duke
of
Parma
,
for
their
accommodation
:
but
,
as
there
was
no
possibility
of
furnishing
them
cap
-
a
-
pee
at
Antwerp
,
he
persuaded
him
to
conform
to
the
modern
use
of
the
sword
,
and
meet
the
painter
on
his
own
terms
;
and
suspecting
that
his
fear
would
supply
him
with
other
excuses
for
declining
the
combat
,
he
comforted
him
with
some
distant
insinuations
to
the
prejudice
of
his
adversary
's
courage
,
which
would
in
all
probability
,
evaporate
,
before
any
mischief
could
happen
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
encouragement
,
he
could
not
suppress
the
reluctance
with
which
he
went
to
the
field
,
and
cast
many
a
wishful
look
over
his
left
shoulder
,
to
see
whether
or
not
his
adversary
was
at
his
heels
;
and
when
,
by
the
advice
of
his
second
,
he
took
possession
of
the
ground
,
and
turned
about
with
his
face
to
the
enemy
,
it
was
not
so
dark
,
but
that
Peregrine
could
perceive
the
unusual
paleness
of
his
countenance
,
and
the
sweat
standing
in
large
drops
upon
his
forehead
;
nay
,
there
was
a
manifest
disorder
in
his
speech
,
when
he
regretted
his
want
of
the
Pila
and
Parma
,
with
which
he
would
have
made
a
rattling
noise
,
to
astonish
his
foe
,
in
springing
forward
,
and
singing
the
hymn
to
battle
,
in
the
manner
of
the
ancients
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
observing
the
hesitation
of
his
antagonist
,
who
,
far
from
advancing
,
seemed
to
recoil
,
and
even
struggle
with
his
second
,
he
guessed
the
situation
of
the
painter
's
thoughts
;
and
collecting
all
the
manhood
that
he
possessed
,
seized
the
opportunity
of
profiting
by
his
enemy
's
consternation
;
and
striking
his
sword
and
pistol
together
,
advanced
in
a
sort
of
trot
,
raising
a
loud
howl
,
in
which
he
repeated
,
in
lieu
of
the
Spartan
song
,
part
of
a
strophe
from
one
of
Pindar
's
Pythia
,
beginning
with
Ek
qewn
gar
maxanai
pasai
broteaiV
aretaiV
,
&
c.
    
<EOS>
This
imitation
of
the
Greeks
had
all
the
desired
effect
upon
the
painter
,
who
seeing
the
physician
running
towards
him
,
like
a
fury
,
with
a
pistol
in
his
right
hand
,
which
was
extended
,
and
hearing
the
dreadful
yell
he
uttered
,
and
the
outlandish
words
he
pronounced
,
was
seized
with
an
universal
palsy
of
his
limbs
,
and
would
have
dropp'd
<EOS>
down
upon
the
ground
,
had
not
Pipes
supported
and
encouraged
him
to
stand
upon
his
defence
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
contrary
to
his
expectation
,
finding
that
he
had
not
flinched
from
the
spot
,
though
he
had
now
performed
one
half
of
his
career
,
put
in
practice
his
last
effort
,
by
firing
his
pistol
,
the
noise
of
which
no
sooner
reached
the
ears
of
the
affrighted
painter
,
than
he
recommended
his
soul
to
God
,
and
roared
for
mercy
with
great
vociferation
.
    
<EOS>
The
republican
,
overjoyed
at
this
exclamation
,
commanded
him
to
yield
,
and
surrender
his
arms
,
on
pain
of
immediate
death
;
upon
which
he
threw
away
his
pistols
and
sword
,
in
spite
of
all
the
admonitions
and
even
threats
of
his
second
,
who
left
him
to
his
fate
,
and
went
up
to
his
master
,
stopping
his
nose
with
signs
of
loathing
and
abhorrence
.
    
<EOS>
The
victor
having
won
the
Spolia
Opima
,
granted
him
his
life
,
on
condition
,
that
he
would
on
his
knees
supplicate
his
pardon
,
acknowledge
himself
inferior
to
his
conqueror
in
every
virtue
and
qualification
,
and
promise
for
the
future
to
merit
his
favour
by
submission
and
respect
.
<EOS>
These
insolent
terms
were
readily
embraced
by
the
unfortunate
challenger
,
who
fairly
owned
,
that
he
was
not
at
all
calculated
for
the
purposes
of
war
,
and
that
henceforth
he
would
contend
with
no
weapon
but
his
pencil
.
<EOS>
He
begg'd
with
great
humility
<EOS>
,
that
Mr
Pickle
would
not
think
the
worse
of
his
morals
for
this
defect
of
courage
,
which
was
a
natural
infirmity
inherited
from
his
father
,
and
suspend
his
opinion
of
his
talents
,
until
he
should
have
an
opportunity
of
contemplating
the
charms
of
his
Cleopatra
,
which
would
be
finished
in
less
than
three
months
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
observed
with
an
affected
air
of
displeasure
,
that
no
man
could
be
justly
condemned
for
being
subject
to
the
impressions
of
fear
;
and
therefore
his
cowardice
might
easily
be
forgiven
:
but
,
there
was
something
so
presumptuous
,
dishonest
and
disingenuous
,
in
arrogating
a
quality
to
which
he
knew
he
had
not
the
smallest
pretension
,
that
he
could
not
forget
his
misbehaviour
all
at
once
,
though
he
would
condescend
to
communicate
with
him
as
formerly
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
a
reformation
in
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Pallet
protested
,
that
there
was
no
dissimulation
in
the
case
;
for
he
was
ignorant
of
his
own
weakness
,
until
his
resolution
was
put
to
the
trial
:
he
faithfully
promised
to
demean
himself
,
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
tour
,
with
that
conscious
modesty
and
penitence
which
became
a
person
in
his
condition
;
and
,
for
the
present
,
implored
the
assistance
of
Mr
Pipes
,
in
disembarassing
him
from
the
disagreeable
consequence
of
his
fear
.

Chapter
LXIX
   
<EOS>
Tom
was
accordingly
ordered
to
minister
to
his
occasions
;
and
the
conqueror
,
elated
with
his
success
,
which
he
in
a
great
measure
attributed
to
his
manner
of
attack
,
and
the
hymn
which
he
howled
,
told
Peregrine
,
that
he
was
now
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
Pindar
sung
in
these
words
,
Ossa
de
mh
pefilhke
ZeuV
,
atuzontai
 
boan
Pieridwn
aionta
;
for
he
had
no
sooner
begun
to
repeat
the
mellifluent
strains
of
that
divine
poet
,
than
the
wretch
his
antagonist
was
confounded
,
and
his
nerves
unstrung
.
    
<EOS>
On
their
return
to
the
inn
,
he
expatiated
on
the
prudence
and
tranquillity
of
his
own
behaviour
,
and
ascribed
the
consternation
of
Pallet
to
the
remembrance
of
some
crime
that
lay
heavy
upon
his
conscience
:
for
,
in
his
opinion
,
a
man
of
virtue
and
common
sense
could
not
possibly
be
afraid
of
death
,
which
is
not
only
the
peaceful
harbour
that
receives
him
shattered
on
the
tempestuous
sea
of
life
,
but
also
the
eternal
seal
of
his
fame
and
glory
,
which
it
is
no
longer
in
his
power
to
forfeit
and
forego
.
<EOS>
He
lamented
his
fate
,
in
being
doomed
to
live
in
such
degenerate
days
,
when
war
is
become
a
mercenary
trade
;
and
ardently
wished
,
that
the
day
would
come
,
when
he
should
have
such
an
opportunity
of
signalizing
his
courage
in
the
cause
of
liberty
,
as
that
of
Marathon
,
where
an
handful
of
Athenians
,
fighting
for
their
freedom
,
defeated
the
whole
strength
of
the
Persian
empire
.
"
<EOS>
Would
to
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
my
muse
were
blessed
with
an
occasion
to
emulate
that
glorious
testimony
on
the
trophy
in
Cyprus
,
erected
by
Cimon
,
for
two
great
victories
gained
on
the
same
day
over
the
Persians
by
sea
and
land
;
in
which
it
is
very
remarkable
,
that
the
greatness
of
the
occasion
has
raised
the
manner
of
expression
above
the
usual
simplicity
and
modesty
of
all
other
ancient
inscriptions
.
"
    
<EOS>
He
then
repeated
it
with
all
the
pomp
of
declamation
,
and
signified
his
hope
,
that
the
French
would
one
day
invade
us
with
such
an
army
as
that
which
Xerxes
led
into
Greece
,
that
it
might
be
in
his
power
to
devote
himself
,
like
Leonidas
,
to
the
freedom
of
his
country
.
    
<EOS>
This
memorable
combat
being
thus
determined
,
and
every
thing
that
was
remarkable
in
Antwerp
surveyed
,
they
sent
their
baggage
down
the
Scheld
to
Rotterdam
,
and
set
out
for
the
same
place
in
a
post
-
waggon
,
which
that
same
evening
brought
them
in
safety
to
the
banks
of
the
Maeze
.
<EOS>
They
put
up
at
an
English
house
of
entertainment
,
remarkable
for
the
modesty
and
moderation
of
the
landlord
;
and
next
morning
the
doctor
went
in
person
,
to
deliver
letters
of
recommendation
to
two
Dutch
gentlemen
,
from
one
of
his
acquaintance
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
Neither
of
them
happened
to
be
at
home
when
he
called
;
so
that
he
left
a
message
at
their
lodgings
,
with
his
address
;
and
in
the
afternoon
they
waited
upon
the
company
,
and
after
many
hospitable
professions
,
one
of
the
two
invited
them
to
spend
the
evening
at
his
house
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
they
had
provided
a
pleasure
-
yacht
,
in
which
they
proposed
to
treat
them
with
an
excursion
upon
the
Maeze
.
<EOS>
This
being
almost
the
only
diversion
that
place
affords
<EOS>
,
our
young
gentleman
relished
the
proposal
;
and
notwithstanding
the
remonstrances
of
Mr
Jolter
,
who
declined
the
voyage
on
account
of
the
roughness
of
the
weather
,
they
went
on
board
without
hesitation
,
and
found
a
collation
prepared
in
the
cabin
.
<EOS>
While
they
tacked
to
and
fro
in
the
river
,
under
the
impulse
of
a
mackerel
breeze
,
the
physician
expressed
his
satisfaction
,
and
Pallet
was
ravished
with
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
wind
increasing
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
the
Dutchmen
,
who
had
now
an
opportunity
of
shewing
their
dexterity
in
the
management
of
the
vessel
,
the
guests
found
it
inconvenient
to
stand
upon
deck
,
and
impossible
to
sit
below
,
on
account
of
the
clouds
of
tobacco
-
smoke
which
rolled
from
the
pipes
of
their
entertainers
,
in
such
volumes
as
annoyed
them
even
to
the
hazard
of
suffocation
.
<EOS>
This
fumigation
,
together
with
the
extraordinary
motion
of
the
ship
,
began
to
affect
the
head
and
stomach
of
the
painter
,
who
begg'd
earnestly
to
be
set
on
shore
:
but
the
Dutch
gentlemen
,
who
had
no
idea
of
his
sufferings
,
to
which
they
had
always
been
utter
strangers
,
insisted
,
with
surprising
obstinacy
of
regard
,
upon
his
staying
until
he
should
see
an
instance
of
the
skill
of
their
mariners
;
and
bringing
him
on
deck
,
commanded
the
men
to
carry
the
vessel
's
leegunwale
under
water
.
<EOS>
This
nicety
of
navigation
they
instantly
performed
,
to
the
admiration
of
Pickle
,
the
discomposure
of
the
doctor
,
and
terror
of
Pallet
,
who
blessed
himself
from
the
courtesy
of
a
Dutchman
,
and
prayed
to
heaven
for
his
deliverance
.
    
<EOS>
While
the
Hollanders
enjoyed
the
reputation
of
this
feat
,
and
the
distress
of
the
painter
at
the
same
time
,
the
yacht
was
overtaken
by
a
sudden
squall
,
that
overset
her
in
a
moment
,
and
flung
every
man
overboard
into
the
Maeze
,
before
they
could
have
the
least
warning
of
their
fate
,
much
less
,
time
to
provide
against
the
accident
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
an
expert
swimmer
,
reached
the
shore
in
safety
;
the
physician
,
in
he
agonies
of
despair
,
laid
fast
hold
on
the
trunk
-
breeches
of
one
of
the
men
,
who
dragged
him
to
the
other
side
;
the
entertainers
landed
at
the
bomb
-
keys
,
smoking
their
pipes
all
the
way
with
great
deliberation
;
and
the
poor
painter
must
have
gone
to
the
bottom
,
had
not
he
been
encountered
by
the
cable
of
a
ship
,
that
lay
at
anchor
near
the
scene
of
their
disaster
.
<EOS>
Though
his
senses
had
forsaken
him
,
his
hands
fastened
by
instinct
on
this
providential
occurrence
,
which
he
held
with
such
a
convulsive
grasp
,
that
when
a
boat
was
sent
out
to
bring
him
on
shore
,
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
that
his
fingers
were
disengaged
.
<EOS>
He
was
carried
into
a
house
,
deprived
of
the
use
of
speech
,
and
bereft
of
all
sensation
;
and
being
suspended
by
the
heels
,
a
vast
quantity
of
water
ran
out
of
his
mouth
.
<EOS>
This
evacuation
being
made
,
he
began
to
utter
dreadful
groans
,
which
gradually
increased
to
a
continued
roar
;
and
after
he
had
regained
the
use
of
his
senses
,
underwent
a
delirium
that
lasted
several
hours
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
treaters
,
they
never
dreamed
of
expressing
the
least
concern
to
Pickle
or
the
physician
for
what
had
happened
,
because
it
was
an
accident
so
common
,
as
to
pass
without
notice
;
but
they
were
very
much
surprized
to
find
,
upon
inquiry
,
that
Pallet
could
not
swim
,
it
being
as
natural
for
a
Dutchman
,
as
a
deal
-
board
,
to
float
upon
the
surface
.
    
<EOS>
Leaving
the
care
of
the
vessel
to
the
seaman
,
the
company
retired
to
their
respective
lodgings
,
in
order
to
shift
their
cloaths
;
and
in
the
evening
our
travellers
were
conducted
to
the
house
of
their
new
friend
,
who
,
with
a
view
of
making
his
invitation
the
more
agreeable
,
had
assembled
to
the
number
of
twenty
or
thirty
Englishmen
,
of
all
ranks
and
degrees
,
from
the
merchant
to
the
periwig
-
maker
's
prentice
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
this
congregation
stood
a
chasing
-
dish
with
live
-
coals
,
for
the
convenience
of
lighting
their
pipes
,
and
every
individual
was
accommodated
with
a
spitting
-
box
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
not
a
mouth
in
the
apartment
unfurnished
with
a
tube
,
so
that
they
resembled
a
convocation
of
Chimeras
breathing
fire
and
smoke
;
and
our
gentlemen
were
fain
to
imitate
their
example
in
their
own
defence
.
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
the
conversation
was
either
very
sprightly
or
polite
;
the
whole
entertainment
was
of
the
Dutch
cast
,
that
is
,
frowzy
and
phlegmatic
:
and
our
adventurer
,
as
he
returned
to
his
lodging
,
tortured
with
the
head
-
ach
,
and
disgusted
with
every
circumstance
of
his
treatment
,
cursed
the
hour
in
which
the
doctor
had
saddled
them
with
such
troublesome
companions
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
by
eight
o'clock
,
these
polite
Hollanders
returned
the
visit
,
and
after
breakfast
,
attended
their
English
friends
to
the
house
of
a
person
that
possessed
a
very
curious
cabinet
of
curiosities
,
to
which
they
had
secured
our
company
's
admission
.
<EOS>
The
owner
of
this
collection
was
a
cheesemonger
,
who
received
them
in
a
woollen
night
-
cap
,
with
straps
buttoned
under
his
chin
.
<EOS>
As
he
understood
no
language
but
his
own
,
he
told
them
,
by
the
canal
of
one
of
their
conductors
,
that
he
did
not
make
a
practice
of
shewing
his
curiosities
;
but
understanding
that
they
were
Englishmen
,
and
recommended
to
his
friends
,
he
was
content
to
submit
them
to
their
perusal
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
led
them
up
a
dark
stair
,
into
a
small
room
,
decorated
with
a
few
paltry
figures
in
plaister
of
Paris
,
two
or
three
miserable
landschapes
,
the
skins
of
an
otter
,
seal
,
and
some
fishes
stuffed
;
and
in
one
corner
stood
a
glass
-
case
,
furnished
with
newts
,
frogs
,
lizzards
and
serpents
,
preserved
in
spirits
;
a
human
foetus
,
a
calf
with
two
heads
,
and
about
two
dozen
of
butterflies
pinned
upon
paper
.
    
<EOS>
The
virtuoso
having
exhibited
these
particulars
,
eyed
the
strangers
with
a
look
solliciting
admiration
and
applause
;
and
as
he
could
not
perceive
any
symptom
of
either
in
their
gestures
or
countenances
,
withdrew
a
curtain
,
and
displayed
a
wainscot
chest
of
drawers
,
in
which
,
he
gave
them
to
understand
,
was
something
that
would
agreeably
amuse
the
imagination
.
<EOS>
Our
travellers
,
regaled
with
this
notice
,
imagined
that
they
would
be
entertained
with
the
sight
of
some
curious
medals
,
or
other
productions
of
antiquity
;
but
how
were
they
disappointed
,
when
they
saw
nothing
but
a
variety
of
shells
,
disposed
in
whimsical
figures
,
in
each
drawer
!
<EOS>
After
he
had
detained
them
full
two
hours
with
a
tedious
commentary
upon
the
shape
,
size
and
colour
of
each
department
,
he
,
with
a
supercilious
simper
,
desired
that
the
English
gentlemen
would
frankly
and
candidly
declare
,
whether
his
cabinet
,
or
that
of
mynheer
Sloane
,
at
London
,
was
the
most
valuable
.
<EOS>
When
this
request
was
signified
in
English
to
the
company
,
the
painter
instantly
exclaimed
,
"
By
the
Lard
!
<EOS>
they
are
not
to
be
named
of
a
day
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
that
matter
,
I
would
not
give
one
corner
of
Saltero
's
coffee
-
house
,
at
Chelsea
,
for
all
the
trash
he
hath
shewn
.
<EOS>
"
Peregrine
,
unwilling
to
mortify
any
person
who
had
done
his
endeavour
to
please
him
,
observed
,
that
what
they
had
seen
was
very
curious
and
entertaining
;
but
that
no
private
collection
in
Europe
was
equal
to
that
of
Sir
Hans
Sloane
,
which
,
exclusive
of
presents
,
had
cost
an
hundred
thousand
pounds
.
    
<EOS>
The
two
conductors
were
confounded
at
this
asseveration
,
which
being
communicated
to
the
cheesemonger
,
he
shook
his
head
with
a
significant
grin
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
he
did
not
choose
to
express
his
incredulity
in
words
,
gave
our
hero
to
understand
,
that
he
did
not
much
depend
upon
his
veracity
.
    
<EOS>
From
the
house
of
this
Dutch
naturalist
,
they
were
dragged
all
round
the
city
,
by
the
painful
civility
of
their
attendants
,
who
did
not
quit
them
till
the
evening
was
well
advanced
,
and
then
not
till
after
they
had
promised
to
be
with
them
before
ten
o'clock
next
day
,
in
order
to
conduct
them
to
a
country
-
house
,
situated
in
a
pleasant
village
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
was
already
so
much
fatigued
with
their
hospitality
,
that
,
for
the
first
time
of
his
life
,
he
suffered
a
dejection
of
spirits
;
and
resolved
,
at
any
rate
,
to
avoid
the
threatened
persecution
of
to
-
morrow
:
with
this
view
,
he
ordered
his
servants
to
pack
up
some
cloaths
and
linnen
in
a
portmanteau
;
and
in
the
morning
embarked
,
with
his
governor
,
in
the
Treckskuyt
,
for
the
Hague
,
wither
he
pretended
to
be
called
by
some
urgent
occasion
,
leaving
his
fellow
-
travellers
to
make
his
apology
to
their
friends
;
and
assuring
them
,
that
he
would
not
proceed
for
Amsterdam
,
without
their
society
.
<EOS>
He
arrived
at
the
Hague
in
the
forenoon
,
and
dined
at
an
ordinary
frequented
by
officers
and
people
of
fashion
;
where
being
informed
,
that
the
princess
would
see
company
in
the
evening
,
he
dressed
himself
in
a
rich
suit
of
the
Parisian
cut
,
and
went
to
court
,
without
any
introduction
.
<EOS>
A
person
of
his
appearance
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
notice
of
such
as
small
circle
.
<EOS>
The
prince
himself
understanding
he
was
an
Englishman
and
a
stranger
,
went
up
to
him
,
without
ceremony
;
and
having
welcomed
him
to
the
place
,
converted
with
him
,
for
some
minutes
,
on
the
common
topics
of
discourse

Chapter
LXX
   
<EOS>
Being
joined
by
their
fellow
-
travellers
,
in
the
morning
,
they
made
a
tour
to
all
the
remarkable
places
in
this
celebrated
village
;
saw
the
Foundery
,
the
Stadthouse
,
the
Spinhuys
,
Vauxhall
,
and
Count
Bentinck
's
gardens
,
and
in
the
evening
went
to
the
French
comedy
,
which
was
directed
by
a
noted
Harlequin
,
who
had
found
means
to
flatter
the
Dutch
taste
so
effectually
,
that
they
extolled
him
as
the
greatest
actor
that
ever
appeared
in
the
province
of
Holland
.
<EOS>
This
famous
company
did
not
represent
regular
theatrical
pieces
,
but
only
a
sort
of
impromptu
's
,
in
which
this
noted
player
always
performed
the
greatest
part
of
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
Among
other
sallies
of
wit
that
escaped
him
,
there
was
one
circumstance
so
remarkably
adapted
to
the
disposition
and
genius
of
his
audience
,
that
it
were
pity
to
pass
it
over
in
silence
:
    
A
windmill
being
exhibited
on
the
scene
,
Harlequin
,
after
having
surveyed
it
with
curiosity
and
admiration
,
asks
of
one
of
the
millers
,
the
use
of
that
machine
;
and
being
told
,
that
it
was
a
windmill
,
observes
with
some
concern
,
that
as
there
was
not
the
least
breath
of
wind
,
he
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
it
turn
around
.
<EOS>
Urged
by
this
consideration
,
he
puts
himself
into
the
attitude
of
a
person
wrapt
in
profound
meditation
;
and
having
continued
a
few
seconds
in
this
posture
,
runs
to
the
miller
with
great
eagerness
and
joy
,
and
telling
him
,
that
he
had
found
an
expedient
to
make
his
mill
work
,
very
fairly
unbuttons
his
breeches
,
and
presenting
his
posteriors
to
the
sails
of
the
machine
,
certain
explosions
are
immediately
heard
,
and
the
arms
of
the
mill
begin
to
turn
around
,
to
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
the
spectators
,
who
approve
the
joke
with
loud
peals
of
applause
.
    
<EOS>
Our
travellers
stayed
a
few
days
at
the
Hague
,
during
which
the
young
gentleman
waited
on
the
British
embassador
,
to
whom
he
was
recommended
by
his
Excellency
at
Paris
,
and
lost
about
thirty
guineas
at
billiards
to
a
French
adventurer
,
who
decoyed
him
into
the
snare
by
keeping
up
his
game
;
then
they
departed
in
a
post
-
waggon
for
Amsterdam
,
being
provided
with
letters
of
introduction
to
an
English
merchant
residing
in
that
city
,
under
whose
auspices
they
visited
every
thing
worth
seeing
,
and
among
other
excursions
went
to
see
a
Dutch
tragedy
acted
;
an
entertainment
which
,
of
all
others
,
had
the
strangest
effect
upon
the
organs
of
our
hero
:
the
dress
of
their
chief
personages
was
so
antick
,
their
manner
so
aukwardly
absurd
,
and
their
language
so
ridiculously
unfit
for
conveying
the
sentiments
of
love
and
honour
,
that
Peregrine
's
nerves
were
diuretically
affected
with
the
complicated
absurdity
,
and
he
was
compelled
to
withdraw
twenty
times
before
the
catastrophe
of
the
piece
.
    
<EOS>
The
subject
of
this
performance
was
the
famous
story
of
Scipio
's
continence
and
virtue
,
in
restoring
the
fair
captive
to
her
lover
.
<EOS>
The
young
Roman
hero
was
represented
by
a
broad
-
fac'd
Batavian
,
in
a
burgo
-
master
's
gown
and
a
fur
-
cap
,
sitting
smoaking
his
pipe
at
a
table
furnished
with
a
can
of
beer
,
a
drinking
-
glass
,
and
a
plate
of
tobacco
:
the
lady
was
such
a
person
as
Scipio
might
very
well
be
supported
to
give
away
,
with
-
out
any
great
effort
of
generosity
;
and
indeed
the
Celtiberian
prince
seemed
to
be
of
that
opinion
;
for
,
upon
receiving
her
from
the
hand
of
the
victor
,
he
discovered
none
of
those
transports
of
gratitude
and
joy
which
Livy
describes
,
in
recounting
this
event
.
<EOS>
The
Dutch
Scipio
,
however
,
was
complaisant
enough
in
his
way
;
for
he
desired
her
to
sit
at
his
right
hand
,
by
the
appellation
of
Ya
frow
,
and
with
his
own
fingers
filling
a
clean
pipe
,
presented
it
to
Mynheer
Allucio
the
lover
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
oeconomy
of
the
piece
was
in
the
same
taste
;
which
was
so
agreeable
to
the
audience
,
that
they
seemed
to
have
shaken
off
their
natural
phlegm
,
in
order
to
applaud
the
performance
.
    
<EOS>
From
the
play
our
company
adjourned
to
the
house
of
their
friend
,
where
they
spent
the
evening
;
and
the
conversation
turning
upon
poetry
,
a
Dutchman
who
was
present
,
and
understood
the
English
language
,
having
listened
very
attentively
to
the
discourse
,
lifted
up
with
both
hands
the
greatest
part
of
a
Cheshire
cheese
that
lay
upon
the
table
,
saying
,
"
I
do
know
vat
is
boetrie
.
<EOS>
Mine
brotre
be
a
great
boet
,
and
ave
vrought
a
book
as
dick
as
all
dat
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
diverted
with
this
method
of
estimating
an
author
according
to
the
quantity
of
his
works
,
inquired
about
the
subjects
of
this
bard
's
writing
;
but
of
these
his
brother
could
give
no
account
,
or
other
information
,
but
that
there
was
little
market
for
the
commodity
,
which
hung
heavy
upon
his
hands
,
and
induced
him
to
with
he
had
applied
himself
to
another
trade
.
    
<EOS>
The
only
remarkable
scene
in
Amsterdam
,
which
our
company
had
not
seen
,
was
the
Spuyl
or
musick
-
houses
,
which
,
by
the
connivance
of
the
magistrates
,
are
maintained
for
the
recreation
of
those
who
might
attempt
the
chastity
of
creditable
women
,
if
they
were
not
provided
with
such
conveniences
.
<EOS>
To
one
of
these
night
-
houses
did
our
travellers
repair
,
under
the
conduct
of
the
English
merchant
,
and
were
introduced
into
such
another
place
as
the
ever
-
memorable
coffee
-
house
of
Moll
King
;
with
this
difference
,
that
the
company
here
were
not
so
riotous
as
the
Bucks
of
Covent
-
Garden
,
but
formed
themselves
into
a
circle
,
within
which
some
of
the
number
danced
to
the
musick
of
a
scurvy
organ
and
a
few
other
instruments
,
that
uttered
tunes
very
suitable
to
the
disposition
of
the
hearers
,
while
the
whole
apartment
was
shrouded
with
clouds
of
smoke
impervious
to
the
view
.
<EOS>
When
our
gentlemen
entered
,
the
floor
was
occupied
by
two
females
and
their
gallants
,
who
,
in
the
performance
of
their
exercise
,
lifted
their
legs
like
so
many
oxen
at
plough
;
and
the
pipe
of
one
of
these
hoppers
happening
to
be
exhausted
in
the
midst
of
his
sarabrand
,
he
very
deliberately
drew
forth
his
tobacco
-
box
,
filling
and
lighting
it
again
,
without
any
interruption
to
the
dance
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
being
unchecked
by
the
presence
of
his
governor
,
who
was
too
tender
of
his
own
reputation
to
attend
them
in
this
expedition
,
made
up
to
a
sprightly
French
girl
that
sat
in
seeming
expectation
of
a
customer
,
and
prevailing
upon
her
to
be
his
partner
,
led
her
into
the
circle
,
and
,
in
his
turn
,
took
the
opportunity
of
dancing
a
minuet
,
to
the
admiration
of
all
present
.
<EOS>
He
intended
to
have
exhibited
another
specimen
of
his
ability
in
this
art
,
when
a
captain
of
a
Dutchman
of
war
chancing
to
come
in
,
and
see
a
stranger
engaged
with
the
lady
whom
,
it
seems
,
he
had
bespoke
for
his
bedfellow
,
he
advanced
,
without
any
ceremony
,
and
seizing
her
by
the
arm
,
pull'd
her
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
who
was
not
a
man
to
put
up
with
such
a
brutal
affront
,
followed
the
ravisher
with
indignation
in
his
eyes
;
and
pushing
him
on
one
side
,
retook
the
subject
of
their
contest
,
and
led
her
back
to
the
place
from
whence
she
had
been
dragged
.
<EOS>
The
Dutchman
,
enraged
at
the
youth
's
presumption
,
obeyed
the
first
dictates
of
his
choler
,
and
lent
his
rival
an
hearty
box
on
the
ear
;
which
was
immediately
repaid
with
interest
,
before
our
hero
could
recollect
himself
sufficiently
to
lay
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
and
beckon
the
aggressor
to
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
confusion
and
disorder
which
this
affair
produced
in
the
room
,
and
the
endeavours
of
Pickle
's
company
,
who
interposed
,
in
order
to
prevent
bloodshed
,
the
antagonists
gained
the
street
;
and
Peregrine
drawing
,
was
surprised
to
see
the
captain
advance
against
him
with
along
knife
,
which
he
preferred
to
the
sword
that
hung
by
his
side
.
    
<EOS>
The
youth
,
confounded
at
this
preposterous
behaviour
,
desired
him
,
in
the
French
tongue
,
to
lay
aside
that
vulgar
implement
,
and
approach
like
a
gentleman
:
but
the
Hollander
,
who
neither
understood
the
proposal
,
nor
would
have
complied
with
his
demand
had
he
been
made
acquainted
with
his
meaning
,
rushed
forward
like
a
desperado
,
before
his
adversary
could
put
himself
on
his
guard
;
and
if
the
young
gentleman
had
not
been
endued
with
surprising
agility
,
his
nose
would
have
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
the
fury
of
the
assailant
.
<EOS>
Finding
himself
in
such
imminent
jeopardy
,
he
jumped
to
one
side
,
and
the
Dutchman
passing
him
,
in
the
force
of
his
career
,
he
with
one
nimble
kick
made
such
application
to
his
enemy
's
heels
,
that
he
flew
like
lightening
into
the
canal
,
where
he
had
almost
perished
,
by
pitching
upon
one
of
the
posts
with
which
it
was
faced
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
performed
this
exploit
,
did
not
stay
for
the
captain
's
coming
on
shore
,
but
retreated
with
all
dispatch
,
by
the
advice
of
his
conductor
,
and
next
day
embarked
,
with
his
companions
,
in
the
Skuyt
,
for
Haarlem
,
where
they
dined
,
and
in
the
evening
arrived
at
the
antient
city
of
Leyden
,
where
they
meet
with
some
English
students
,
who
treated
them
with
great
hospitality
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
the
harmony
of
the
conversation
was
that
same
night
interrupted
by
a
dispute
that
arose
between
one
of
those
young
gentleman
and
the
physician
,
about
the
cold
and
hot
methods
of
prescription
in
the
gout
and
rheumatism
;
and
proceeded
to
such
a
degree
of
mutual
reviling
,
that
Pickle
ashamed
and
incensed
at
his
fellow
-
traveller
's
want
of
urbanity
,
espoused
the
others
cause
,
and
openly
rebuked
him
for
his
unmannerly
petulance
,
which
(
he
said
)
rendered
him
unfit
for
the
purposes
,
and
unworthy
of
the
benefit
of
,
society
.
<EOS>
This
unexpected
declaration
overwhelmed
the
doctor
with
amazement
and
confusion
;
he
was
instantaneously
deprived
of
his
speech
,
and
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
partie
,
sat
in
silent
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
In
all
probability
he
deliberated
with
himself
,
whether
or
not
he
should
expostulate
with
the
young
gentleman
on
the
freedom
he
had
taken
with
his
character
in
a
company
of
strangers
;
but
as
he
knew
that
he
had
not
a
Pallet
to
deal
with
,
he
very
prudently
suppressed
that
suggestion
,
and
in
secret
chewed
the
cud
of
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
After
they
had
visited
the
physic
garden
,
the
university
,
the
anatomical
hall
,
and
every
other
thing
that
was
recommended
to
their
view
,
they
returned
to
Rotterdam
,
and
held
a
consultation
upon
the
method
of
transporting
themselves
to
England
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
whose
grudge
against
Peregrine
was
rather
inflamed
than
allayed
by
our
hero
's
indifference
and
neglect
,
had
tampered
with
the
simplicity
of
the
painter
,
who
was
proud
of
his
advances
towards
a
perfect
reconciliation
;
and
now
took
the
opportunity
of
parting
with
our
adventurer
,
by
declaring
that
he
and
his
friend
Mr
Pallet
were
resolved
to
take
their
passage
in
a
trading
sloop
,
after
he
had
heard
Peregrine
object
against
that
tedious
,
disagreeable
,
and
uncertain
method
of
conveyance
.
<EOS>
Pickle
immediately
saw
his
intention
;
and
,
without
using
the
least
argument
to
dissuade
them
from
their
design
,
or
expressing
the
smallest
degree
of
concern
at
their
separation
,
very
coolly
wished
them
a
prosperous
voyage
,
and
ordered
his
baggage
to
be
sent
to
Helvoetsluys
,
where
he
himself
,
and
his
retinue
,
went
on
board
of
the
pacquet
next
day
,
and
,
by
the
favour
of
a
fair
wind
,
in
eighteen
hours
arrived
at
Harwich
.

Peregrine
delivers
his
letters
of
recommendation
at
London
,
and
returns
to
the
garison
,
to
the
unspeakable
joy
of
the
commodore
and
his
whole
family
.
   
<EOS>
Now
that
our
hero
found
himself
on
English
ground
,
his
heart
dilated
with
the
proud
recollection
of
his
own
improvement
since
he
left
his
native
soil
;
he
began
to
recognize
the
interesting
ideas
of
his
tender
years
;
he
enjoyed
,
by
anticipation
,
the
pleasure
of
seeing
his
friends
in
the
garison
,
after
an
absence
of
eighteen
months
;
and
the
image
of
his
charming
Emily
,
which
other
lets
worthy
considerations
had
depressed
,
resumed
the
full
possession
of
his
breast
.
<EOS>
He
remembered
,
with
shame
,
that
he
had
neglected
the
correspondence
with
her
brother
,
which
he
himself
had
sollicited
,
and
in
consequence
of
which
he
had
received
a
letter
from
that
young
gentleman
while
he
lived
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
these
conscientious
reflections
,
he
was
too
self
-
sufficient
to
think
he
should
find
any
difficulty
in
obtaining
forgives
for
these
sins
of
omission
;
and
began
to
imagine
,
that
his
passion
would
be
prejudicial
to
the
dignity
of
his
situation
,
if
it
could
not
be
gratified
upon
terms
which
formerly
his
imagination
durst
not
conceive
.
    
<EOS>
Sorry
am
I
,
that
the
talk
I
have
undertaken
,
lays
me
under
the
necessity
of
divulging
this
degeneracy
in
the
sentiments
of
our
imperious
youth
,
who
was
now
in
the
heyday
of
his
blood
,
flushed
with
the
consciousness
of
his
own
qualifications
,
vain
of
his
fortune
,
and
elated
on
the
wings
of
imaginary
expectation
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
he
was
deeply
enamoured
of
miss
Gauntlet
,
he
was
far
from
proposing
her
heart
as
the
ultimate
aim
of
his
gallantry
,
which
(
he
did
not
doubt
)
would
triumph
o'er
the
most
illustrious
females
of
the
land
,
and
at
once
regale
his
appetite
and
ambition
.

<EOS>
while
,
being
willing
to
make
his
appearance
at
the
garison
equally
surprising
and
agreeable
,
he
cautioned
Mr
Joker
against
writing
to
the
commodore
,
who
had
not
heard
of
them
since
their
departure
from
Paris
,
and
hired
a
post
-
chaise
and
horses
for
London

<EOS>
The
governor
going
out
to
give
orders
about
the
carriage
,
inadvertently
left
a
paper
book
open
upon
the
table
;
and
his
pupil
casting
his
eyes
upon
the
page
,
chanced
to
read
these
words
:
"
Sept.

<EOS>
Arrived
in

,
by

blessing
of
God

in
this
unhappy
kingdom
of
England
.
<EOS>
And
thus
concludes
the
journal
of
my
last
peregrination
.
<EOS>
"
Peregrine
's
curiosity
being
inflamed
by
this
extraordinary
conclusion
,
he
turned
to
the
beginning
,
and
perused
several
sheets
of
a
diary
,
such
as
is
commonly
kept
by
that
class
of
people
known
by
the
denomination
of
travelling
governors
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
themselves
and
the
parents
or
guardians
of
their
pupils
,
and
for
the
edification
and
entertainment
of
their
friends

That
the

may
have
a
clear
idea
of
Mr
Jolter

performance

we
shall
transcribe
the
transactions
of
one
day
,
as
he
had
recorded
them
;

that
abstract
will
be
a
sufficient
specimen
of
the
whole
plan
and
execution
of
the
work

Set
out

for
Nampont

<EOS>
Troubled
with
flatulencies

Mr

<EOS>
Our
hero
was
so
much
disobliged
with
certain
circumstances
of
this
amusing
and
instructing
journal
,
that
,
by
way
of
punishing
the
author
,
he
interlined
these
words
<EOS>
betwixt
two
paragraphs
,
in
a
manner
that
exactly
resembled
the
tutor
's
hand
-
writing
;
<EOS>
"
Mem
.
<EOS>
Had
the
pleasure
of
drinking
myself
into
a
sweet
intoxication
,
by
toasting
our
lawful
king
,
and
his
royal
family
,
among
some
worthy
English
fathers
of
the
society
of
Jesus
.
"
    
<EOS>
Having
taken
this
revenge
,
he
set
out
for
London
,
where
he
waited
upon
those
noblemen
to
whom
he
had
letters
of
recommendation
from
Paris
;
and
was
not
only
graciously
received
,
but
even
loaded
with
caresses
and
proffers
of
service
,
because
they
understood
he
was
a
young
gentleman
of
fortune
,
who
,
far
from
standing
in
need
of
their
countenance
or
assistance
,
would
make
an
useful
and
creditable
addition
to
the
number
of
their
adherents
.
<EOS>
He
had
the
honour
of
dining
at
their
tables
,
in
consequence
of
pressing
invitations
,
and
of
spending
several
evenings
with
the
ladies
,
to
whom
he
was
particularly
agreeable
,
on
account
of
his
person
,
address
,
and
bleeding
freely
at
play
.
    
<EOS>
Being
thus
initiated
in
the
beau
monde
,
he
thought
it
was
high
time
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
generous
benefactor
the
commodore
;
and
accordingly
departed
one
morning
,
with
his
train
,
for
the
garison
,
at
which
he
arrived
in
safety
the
same
night
.
<EOS>
When
he
entered
the
gate
,
which
was
opened
by
a
new
servant
that
did
not
know
him
,
he
found
his
old
friend
Hatchway
stalking
in
the
yard
,
with
a
night
-
cap
on
his
head
,
and
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
;
and
advancing
to
him
,
took
him
by
the
hand
,
before
he
had
any
intimation
of
his
approach
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
thus
saluted
by
a
stranger
,
stared
at
him
in
silent
astonishment
,
till
he
recollected
his
features
,
which
were
no
sooner
known
,
than
dashing
the
pipe
upon
the
pavement
,
he
exclaimed
,
"
Smite
my
cross
-
trees
!
<EOS>
the'art
welcome
to
port
;
"
and
hugg'd
him
in
his
arms
with
great
affection
.
<EOS>
He
then
,
by
a
cordial
squeeze
,
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
seeing
his
old
ship
-
mate
Tom
,
who
applying
his
whistle
to
his
mouth
,
the
whole
castle
ecchoed
with
his
performance
.
    
<EOS>
The
servants
hearing
the
well
-
known
sound
,
poured
out
in
a
tumult
of
joy
;
and
understanding
that
their
young
master
was
returned
,
raised
such
a
peal
of
acclamation
,
as
astonished
the
commodore
and
his
lady
,
and
inspired
Julia
with
such
an
interesting
presage
,
that
her
heart
began
to
throb
with
violence
;
and
running
out
in
the
hurry
and
perturbation
of
her
hope
,
she
was
so
much
overwhelmed
at
sight
of
her
brother
,
that
she
actually
fainted
in
his
arms
.
<EOS>
But
from
this
trance
she
soon
awaked
;
and
Peregrine
having
testified
his
pleasure
and
affection
,
went
up
stairs
,
and
presented
himself
before
his
godfather
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
Mrs
Trunnion
rose
,
and
received
him
with
a
gracious
embrace
,
blessing
God
for
his
happy
return
from
a
land
of
impiety
and
vice
,
in
which
she
hoped
his
morals
had
not
been
corrupted
,
nor
his
principles
of
religion
altered
or
impaired
.
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
being
confined
to
his
chair
,
was
struck
dumb
with
pleasure
at
his
appearance
;
and
having
made
divers
ineffectual
efforts
to
get
up
,
at
length
discharged
a
volley
of
curses
against
his
own
limbs
,
and
held
out
his
hand
to
his
godson
,
who
kiss'd
it
with
great
respect
.
    
<EOS>
After
he
had
finished
his
apostrophe
to
the
gout
,
which
was
the
daily
and
hourly
subject
of
his
execrations
,
"
<EOS>
Well
,
my
lad
<EOS>
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
care
not
how
soon
I
go
to
bottom
,
now
I
behold
thee
safe
in
harbour
again
:
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
tell
a
damn'd
lie
:
<EOS>
I
would
I
could
keep
afloat
,
until
I
should
see
a
lusty
boy
of
thy
begetting
.
<EOS>
Odds
my
timbers
!
<EOS>
I
love
thee
so
well
,
that
I
believe
thou
art
the
spawn
of
my
own
body
;
though
I
can
give
no
account
of
thy
being
put
upon
the
stocks
.
"
<EOS>
Then
turning
his
eye
upon
Pipes
,
who
by
this
time
had
penetrated
into
his
apartment
,
and
addressed
him
with
the
usual
salutation
of
"
What
cheer
?
"
<EOS>
"
Ahey
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
are
you
there
,
you
herring
-
fac'd
son
of
a
sea
-
calf
?
<EOS>
What
a
slippery
trick
you
played
your
old
commander
!
<EOS>
But
,
come
,
you
dog
,
there
's
my
fist
;
I
forgive
you
,
for
the
love
you
bear
to
my
godson
.
<EOS>
Go
man
your
tackle
,
and
hoist
a
cask
of
strong
beer
into
the
yard
,
knock
out
the
bung
,
and
put
a
pump
in
it
,
for
the
use
of
all
my
servants
and
neighbours
:
and
d'ye
hear
,
let
the
patereroes
be
fired
,
and
the
garison
illuminated
,
as
rejoicings
for
the
safe
arrival
of
your
master
.
<EOS>
By
the
Lord
!
<EOS>
if
I
had
the
use
of
these
damn'd
shambling
shanks
,
I
would
dance
an
hornpipe
with
the
best
of
you
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
next
object
of
his
attention
was
Mr
Jolter
,
who
was
honoured
with
particular
marks
of
distinction
,
and
the
repeated
promise
of
enjoying
the
living
in
his
gift
,
as
an
acknowledgment
of
the
care
and
discretion
with
which
he
had
superintended
the
education
and
morals
of
our
hero
.
<EOS>
The
governor
was
so
affected
by
the
generosity
of
his
patron
,
that
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
while
he
expressed
his
gratitude
,
and
the
infinite
satisfaction
he
felt
,
in
contemplating
the
accomplishments
of
his
pupil
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Pipes
did
not
neglect
the
orders
he
had
received
:
the
beer
was
produced
,
the
gates
were
thrown
open
for
the
admission
of
all
comers
,
the
whole
house
was
lighted
up
,
and
the
patereroes
discharged
in
repeated
vollies
.
<EOS>
Such
phaenomena
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
neighbourhood
.
<EOS>
The
club
at
Tunley
's
were
astonished
at
the
report
of
the
guns
,
which
produced
various
conjectures
among
the
members
of
that
sagacious
society
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
observed
,
that
in
all
likelihood
the
commodore
was
visited
by
hobgoblins
,
and
ordered
the
guns
to
be
fired
in
token
of
distress
,
as
he
had
acted
twenty
years
before
,
when
he
was
annoyed
by
the
same
grievance
.
<EOS>
The
exciseman
,
with
a
waggish
sneer
,
expressed
his
apprehension
of
Trunnion
's
death
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
patereroes
might
be
discharged
with
an
equivocal
intent
,
either
as
signals
of
his
lady
's
sorrow
or
rejoicing
.
<EOS>
The
attorney
signified
a
suspicion
of
Hatchway
's
being
married
to
Miss
Pickle
,
and
that
the
firing
and
illumination
were
in
honour
of
the
nuptials
:
upon
which
Gamaliel
discovered
some
faint
signs
of
emotion
,
and
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
gave
it
as
his
opinion
,
that
his
sister
was
brought
to
bed
.
    
<EOS>
While
they
were
thus
bewildered
in
the
maze
of
their
own
imaginations
,
a
company
of
countrymen
,
who
sat
drinking
in
the
kitchen
,
and
whose
legs
were
more
ready
than
their
invention
,
sallied
out
to
know
the
meaning
of
these
exhibitions
;
and
understanding
that
there
was
a
butt
of
strong
beer
abroach
in
the
yard
,
to
which
they
were
invited
by
the
servants
,
saved
themselves
the
trouble
and
expence
of
returning
to
spend
the
evening
at
the
public
house
,
and
listed
themselves
under
the
banner
of
Tom
Pipes
,
who
presided
as
director
of
this
festival
.
    
<EOS>
The
news
of
Peregrine
's
return
being
communicated
to
the
parish
,
the
parson
and
three
or
four
neighbouring
gentlemen
,
who
were
well
-
wishers
to
our
hero
,
immediately
repaired
to
the
garison
,
in
order
to
pay
their
compliments
on
this
happy
event
;
and
being
detained
to
supper
,
an
elegant
entertainment
was
prepared
by
the
direction
of
Miss
July
,
who
was
an
excellent
housewife
;
and
the
commodore
was
so
invigorated
with
joy
,
that
he
seemed
to
have
renewed
his
age
.
    
<EOS>
Among
those
who
honoured
the
occasion
with
his
presence
was
Mr
Clover
,
the
young
gentleman
that
made
his
addresses
to
Peregrine
's
sister
;
and
his
heart
was
so
big
with
his
passion
,
that
while
the
rest
of
the
company
were
ingrossed
by
their
cups
,
he
seized
an
opportunity
of
our
hero
's
being
detached
from
the
conversation
,
and
in
the
impatience
of
his
love
,
conjured
him
to
consent
to
his
happiness
;
protesting
,
that
he
would
comply
with
any
terms
of
settlement
that
a
man
of
his
fortune
could
embrace
,
in
favour
of
a
young
lady
who
was
absolute
mistress
of
his
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Our
youth
thanked
him
very
politely
for
his
favourable
sentiments
and
honourable
intention
towards
his
sister
,
and
told
him
,
that
at
present
he
saw
no
reason
to
obstruct
his
desire
;
that
he
would
consult
Julia
's
own
inclinations
,
and
confer
with
him
about
the
means
of
gratifying
his
wish
:
<EOS>
but
,
in
the
mean
time
,
begg'd
to
be
excused
from
discussing
any
point
of
such
importance
to
them
both
,
and
reminding
him
of
the
jovial
purpose
on
which
they
were
happily
met
,
promoted
such
a
quick
circulation
of
the
bottle
,
that
their
mirth
grew
noisy
and
obstreperous
<EOS>
:
they
broke
forth
into
repeated
peals
of
laughter
,
without
any
previous
incitement
,
except
that
of
claret
.
<EOS>
These
explosions
were
succeeded
by
Bacchanalian
songs
,
in
which
the
old
gentleman
himself
attempted
to
bear
a
share
;
the
sedate
governor
snapped
time
with
his
fingers
,
and
the
parish
-
priest
assisted
in
the
chorus
with
a
most
expressive
nakedness
of
countenance
.
<EOS>
Before
midnight
,
they
were
almost
all
pinned
to
their
chairs
,
as
if
they
had
been
fixed
by
the
power
of
inchantment
;
and
what
rendered
the
confinement
still
more
unfortunate
,
every
servant
in
the
house
was
in
the
same
situation
;
so
that
they
were
fain
to
take
their
repose
as
they
sat
,
and
nodded
to
each
other
like
a
congregation
of
anabaptists
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
Peregrine
communed
with
his
sister
on
the
subject
of
her
match
with
Mr
Clover
,
who
(
she
told
him
)
had
offered
to
settle
a
jointure
of
four
hundred
pounds
,
and
take
her
to
wife
,
without
any
expectation
of
a
dowry
.
<EOS>
She
,
moreover
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
in
his
absence
she
had
received
several
messages
from
her
mother
,
commanding
her
to
return
to
her
father
's
house
;
but
that
she
had
refused
to
obey
these
orders
,
by
the
advice
and
injunction
of
her
aunt
and
the
commodore
,
which
were
indeed
seconded
by
her
own
inclination
;
because
she
had
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
,
that
her
mother
only
wanted
an
opportunity
of
treating
her
with
severity
and
rancour
:
for
the
resentment
of
that
lady
had
been
carried
to
such
indecent
lengths
,
that
seeing
her
daughter
at
church
one
day
,
she
rose
up
before
the
parson
entered
,
and
reviled
her
with
great
bitterness
,
in
the
face
of
the
whole
congregation
.

Visits

who
receives
him
according
to
his
deserts

<EOS>
Her
brother
being
of
opinion
,
that
Mr
Clover
's
proposal
was
not
to
be
neglected
,
especially
as
Julia
's
heart
was
engaged
in
his
favour
,
communicated
the
affair
to
his
uncle
,
who
,
with
the
approbation
of
Mrs
Trunnion
,
declared
himself
well
satisfied
with
the
young
man
's
addresses
,
and
desired
that
they
might
be
buckled
with
all
expedition
,
without
the
knowledge
or
concurrence
of
her
parents
,
to
whom
(
on
account
of
their
unnatural
barbarity
)
she
was
not
bound
to
pay
the
least
regard
.
<EOS>
Though
our
adventurer
entertained
the
same
sentiments
of
the
matter
,
and
the
lover
dreading
some
obstruction
,
earnestly
begg'd
the
immediate
condescension
of
his
mistress
,
she
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
such
a
material
step
,
without
having
first
solicited
the
permission
of
her
father
,
resolved
,
nevertheless
,
to
comply
with
the
dictates
of
her
own
heart
,
should
his
objections
be
frivolous
or
unjust
.
    
<EOS>
Urged
by
this
determination
,
her
admirer
waited
upon
Mr
Gamaliel
at
the
public
house
,
and
with
the
appearance
of
great
deference
and
respect
,
made
him
acquainted
with
his
affection
for
his
daughter
,
communicated
the
particulars
of
his
fortune
,
with
the
terms
of
settlement
<EOS>
he
was
ready
to
make
;
and
in
conclusion
told
him
,
that
he
would
marry
her
without
a
portion
.
    
<EOS>
This
last
offer
seemed
to
have
some
weight
with
the
father
,
who
received
it
with
civility
,
and
promised
,
in
a
day
or
two
,
to
favour
him
with
a
final
answer
to
his
demand
.
<EOS>
He
,
accordingly
,
that
same
evening
consulted
his
wife
,
who
being
exasperated
at
the
prospect
of
her
daughter
's
independency
,
argued
with
the
most
virulent
expostulation
against
the
match
,
as
an
impudent
scheme
of
her
own
planning
,
with
a
view
of
insulting
her
parents
,
towards
whom
she
had
already
been
guilty
of
the
most
vicious
disobedience
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
used
such
remonstrances
,
as
not
only
averted
this
weak
husband
's
inclination
from
the
proposal
which
he
had
relished
before
,
but
even
instigated
him
to
apply
for
a
warrant
to
apprehend
his
daughter
,
on
the
supposition
that
she
was
about
to
bestow
herself
in
marriage
,
without
his
privity
or
consent
.
    
<EOS>
The
justice
of
peace
to
whom
this
application
was
made
,
though
he
could
not
refuse
the
order
,
yet
,
being
no
stranger
to
the
malevolence
of
the
mother
,
which
,
together
with
Gamaliel
's
simplicity
,
was
notorious
in
the
county
,
he
sent
an
intimation
of
what
had
happened
to
the
garison
;
upon
which
,
a
couple
of
centinels
were
placed
on
the
gate
,
and
at
the
pressing
solicitation
of
the
lover
,
as
well
as
the
desire
of
the
commodore
,
her
brother
and
aunt
,
Julia
was
wedded
without
further
delay
;
the
ceremony
being
performed
by
Mr
Jolter
,
because
the
parish
-
priest
prudently
declined
any
occasion
of
giving
offence
,
and
the
curate
was
too
much
in
the
interest
of
their
enemies
,
to
be
employed
in
that
office
.
    
<EOS>
This
domestic
concern
being
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
our
hero
,
he
escorted
her
next
day
to
the
house
of
her
husband
,
who
immediately
wrote
a
letter
to
her
father
,
declaring
his
reasons
for
having
thus
superseded
his
authority
;
and
Mrs
Pickle
's
mortification
was
unspeakable
.
    
<EOS>
That
the
new
-
married
couple
might
be
guarded
against
all
insult
,
our
young
gentleman
and
his
friend
Hatchway
,
with
their
adherents
,
lodged
in
Mr
Clover
's
house
for
some
weeks
;
during
which
,
they
visited
their
acquaintance
in
the
neighbourhood
,
according
to
custom
;
and
when
the
tranquillity
of
their
family
was
perfectly
established
,
and
the
contract
of
marriage
executed
in
the
presence
of
the
old
commodore
and
his
lady
,
who
gave
her
niece
five
hundred
pounds
to
purchase
jewels
and
cloaths
,
Mr
Peregrine
could
no
longer
restrain
his
impatience
to
see
his
dear
Emily
;
and
told
his
uncle
,
that
next
day
he
proposed
to
ride
across
the
country
,
in
order
to
visit
his
friend
Gauntlet
,
from
whom
he
had
not
heard
of
a
long
time
.
    
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
,
looking
steadfastly
in
his
face
,
"
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
damn
your
cunning
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
find
the
anchor
holds
fast
:
I
did
suppose
as
how
you
would
have
slipt
your
cable
,
and
changed
your
birth
;
but
,
<EOS>
I
see
,
when
a
young
fellow
is
once
brought
up
by
a
pretty
wench
,
he
may
man
his
capstans
and
viol
-
block
,
if
he
wool
;
but
he
'll
as
soon
heave
up
the
Pike
of
Teneriff
,
as
bring
his
anchor
aweigh
!
<EOS>
Odds

<EOS>
had
I
known
the
young
woman
was
Ned
Gauntlet
's
daughter
,
I
shoul'dn't
have
thrown
out
signal
for
leaving
off
chace
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
was
not
a
little
surprized
to
hear
the
commodore
talk
in
this
stile
;
and
immediately
conjectured
,
that
his
friend
Godfrey
had
informed
him
of
the
whole
affair
.
    
<EOS>
Instead
of
listening
to
this
approbation
of
his
flame
,
with
those
transports
of
joy
which
he
would
have
felt
,
had
he
retained
his
former
sentiments
,
he
was
chagrined
at
Trunnion
's
declaration
,
and
offended
ar
the
presumption
of
the
young
soldier
,
in
pretending
to
disclose
the
secret
with
which
he
had
intrusted
him
.
<EOS>
Reddening
with
these
reflections
,
he
assured
the
commodore
,
that
he
never
had
serious
thoughts
of
matrimony
:
so
that
,
if
any
person
had
told
him
he
was
under
any
engagement
of
that
kind
,
he
had
abused
his
ear
;
for
,
he
protested
,
that
he
would
never
contract
such
attachments
,
without
his
knowledge
and
express
permission
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
commended
him
for
his
prudent
resolution
,
and
observed
,
that
though
no
person
mentioned
to
him
what
promises
had
passed
betwixt
him
and
his
sweetheart
,
it
was
very
plain
that
he
had
made
love
to
her
;
and
therefore
,
it
was
to
be
supposed
,
that
his
intentions
were
honourable
:
<EOS>
for
,
he
could
not
believe
he
was
such
a
rogue
in
his
heart
,
as
to
endeavour
to
debauch
the
daughter
of
a
brave
officer
,
who
had
served
his
country
with
credit
and
reputation
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
remonstrance
,
which
Pickle
imputed
to
the
commodore
's
ignorance
of
the
world
,
he
set
out
for
the
habitation
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
with
the
unjustifiable
sentiments
of
a
man
of
pleasure
,
who
sacrifices
every
consideration
to
the
desire
of
his
ruling
appetite
;
and
as
Winchester
lay
in
his
way
,
resolved
to
visit
some
of
his
friends
who
lived
in
that
place
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
the
house
of
one
of
these
,
that
he
was
informed
of
Emilia
's
being
then
in
town
with
her
mother
;
upon
which
,
he
excused
himself
from
staying
to
drink
tea
,
and
immediately
repaired
to
their
lodgings
,
according
to
the
direction
he
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
arrived
at
the
door
,
instead
of
undergoing
that
perturbation
of
spirits
,
which
a
lover
,
in
his
interesting
situation
,
might
be
supposed
to
feel
,
he
suffered
no
emotion
but
that
of
vanity
and
pride
,
favoured
with
an
opportunity
of
self
-
gratification
,
and
entered
his
Emilia
's
apartment
with
the
air
of
a
conceited
petit
maitre
,
rather
than
that
of
the
respectful
admirer
,
when
he
visits
the
object
of
his
passion
,
after
an
absence
of
seventeen
months
.
    
<EOS>
The
young
lady
having
been
very
much
disobliged
at
his
mortifying
neglect
of
her
brother
's
letter
,
had
summoned
all
her
own
pride
and
resolution
to
her
aid
;
and
by
means
of
a
happy
disposition
,
so
far
overcame
her
chagrin
at
his
indifference
,
that
she
was
able
to
behave
in
his
presence
with
apparent
tranquillity
and
ease
.
<EOS>
She
was
even
pleased
to
find
,
he
had
by
accident
chosen
a
time
for
his
visit
,
when
she
was
surrounded
by
two
or
three
young
gentlemen
,
who
professed
themselves
her
admirers
.
<EOS>
Our
gallant
was
no
sooner
anounced
,
than
she
collected
all
her
coquettry
,
put
on
the
gayest
air
she
could
assume
,
and
contrived
to
giggle
just
as
he
appeared
at
the
room
-
door
.
<EOS>
The
compliments
of
salutation
being
performed
,
she
welcomed
him
to
England
in
a
careless
manner
,
asked
the
news
of
Paris
,
and
,
before
he
could
make
any
reply
,
desired
one
of
the
other
gentlemen
to
proceed
with
the
sequel
of
that
comical
adventure
,
in
the
relation
of
which
he
had
been
interrupted
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
smiled
within
himself
at
this
behaviour
,
which
(
without
all
doubt
he
believed
)
<EOS>
she
had
affected
to
punish
him
for
his
unkind
silence
,
while
he
was
abroad
;
being
fully
persuaded
,
that
her
heart
was
absolutely
at
his
devotion
.
    
<EOS>
On
this
supposition
,
he
practised
his
Parisian
improvements
on
the
art
of
conversation
,
and
uttered
a
thousand
prettinesses
in
the
way
of
compliment
,
with
such
incredible
rotation
of
tongue
,
that
his
rivals
were
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
;
and
Emilia
fretted
out
of
all
temper
,
at
seeing
herself
deprived
of
the
prerogative
of
the
sex
.
<EOS>
He
persisted
,
however
,
in
this
surprising
loquacity
,
until
the
rest
of
the
company
thought
proper
to
withdraw
,
and
then
contracted
his
discourse
into
the
focus
of
love
,
which
now
put
on
a
very
different
appearance
from
that
which
it
had
formerly
worn
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
that
awful
veneration
which
her
presence
used
to
inspire
,
that
chastity
of
sentiment
and
delicacy
of
expression
,
he
now
gazed
upon
her
with
the
eyes
of
a
libertine
,
he
glowed
with
the
impatience
of
desire
,
talked
in
a
strain
that
barely
kept
within
the
bounds
of
decency
,
and
attempted
to
snatch
such
favours
as
she
,
in
the
tenderness
of
mutual
acknowledgement
,
had
once
vouchsafed
to
bestow
.
    
<EOS>
Grieved
and
offended
as
she
was
,
at
this
palpable
alteration
in
his
carriage
<EOS>
,
she
disdained
to
remind
him
of
his
former
deportment
,
and
with
dissembled
good
humour
,
rallied
him
on
the
progress
he
had
made
in
gallantry
and
address
:
but
,
far
from
submitting
to
the
liberties
he
would
have
taken
,
she
kept
her
person
sacred
from
his
touch
,
and
would
not
even
suffer
him
to
ravish
a
kiss
of
her
fair
hand
:
so
that
he
reaped
no
other
advantage
from
the
exercise
of
his
talents
,
during
this
interview
,
which
lasted
a
whole
hour
,
than
that
of
knowing
he
had
over
-
rated
his
own
importance
;
and
that
Emily
's
heart
was
not
a
garison
likely
to
surrender
at
discretion
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
his
addresses
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
the
mother
,
who
had
gone
abroad
to
visit
by
herself
;
and
the
conversation
becoming
more
general
,
he
understood
,
that
Godfrey
was
at
London
,
soliciting
for
a
lieutenancy
that
had
fallen
vacant
in
the
regiment
to
which
he
belonged
;
and
that
Miss
Sophy
was
at
home
with
her
father
.
    
<EOS>
Though
our
adventurer
had
not
met
with
all
the
success
he
expected
in
his
first
visit
,
he
did
not
despair
of
reducing
the
fortress
,
believing
that
in
time
there
would
be
a
mutiny
in
his
favour
;
and
accordingly
,
carried
on
the
siege
for
several
days
,
without
profiting
by
his
perseverance
;
till
at
length
,
having
attended
the
ladies
to
their
own
house
in
the
country
,
he
began
to
look
upon
this
adventure
as
time
mispent
,
and
resolved
to
discontinue
his
attack
,
in
hopes
of
meeting
with
a
more
favourable
occasion
;
being
,
in
the
mean
time
,
ambitious
of
displaying
,
in
an
higher
sphere
,
those
qualifications
which
his
vanity
told
him
,
were
at
present
misapplied
.

He

his

with
great

,
during
a
fit
of
illness
.
<EOS>
Sets
out
again
for
London
;
meets
with
his
friend
Godfrey
,
who
is
prevailed
upon
to
accompany
him
to
Bath
;
on
the
road
to
which
place
,
they
chance
to
dine
with
a
person
,
who
entertains
them
with
a
curious
account
of
a
certain
company
of
adventurers
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
determined
,
he
took
leave
of
Emilia
and
her
mother
,
on
pretence
of
going
to
London
upon
some
urgent
business
,
and
returned
turned
to
the
garison
,
leaving
the
good
old
lady
very
much
concerned
,
and
the
daughter
incensed
at
his
behaviour
,
which
was
the
more
unexpected
,
because
Godfrey
had
told
them
,
that
the
commodore
approved
of
his
nephew
's
passion
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
found
his
uncle
so
ill
of
the
gout
,
which
,
for
the
first
time
,
had
taken
possession
of
his
stomach
,
that
his
life
was
in
imminent
danger
,
and
the
whole
family
in
disorder
:
he
therefore
took
the
reins
of
government
in
his
own
hands
,
sent
for
all
the
physicians
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
attended
him
in
person
with
the
most
affectionate
care
,
during
the
whole
fit
,
which
lasted
a
fortnight
,
and
then
retired
before
the
strength
of
his
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
old
gentleman
recovered
his
health
,
he
was
so
penetrated
with
Peregrine
's
behaviour
,
that
he
actually
would
have
made
over
to
him
his
whole
fortune
,
and
depended
upon
him
for
his
own
subsistence
,
had
not
our
youth
opposed
the
execution
of
the
deed
with
all
his
influence
and
might
,
and
even
persuaded
him
to
make
a
will
,
in
which
his
friend
Hatchway
,
and
all
his
other
adherents
,
were
liberally
remembered
,
and
his
aunt
provided
for
,
on
her
own
terms
.
<EOS>
This
material
point
being
settled
,
he
,
with
his
uncle
's
permission
,
departed
for
London
,
after
having
seen
the
family
-
affairs
established
under
the
direction
and
administration
of
Mr
Jolter
and
the
lieutenant
:
for
,
by
this
time
,
Mrs
Trunnion
was
wholly
occupied
with
her
spiritual
concerns
.
    
<EOS>
On
his
first
arrival
at
London
,
he
sent
a
card
to
the
lodgings
of
Gauntlet
,
in
consequence
of
a
direction
from
his
mother
;
and
that
young
gentleman
waited
on
him
next
morning
,
though
not
with
that
alacrity
of
countenance
and
warmth
of
friendship
,
which
might
have
been
expected
from
the
intimacy
of
their
former
connexion
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
Peregrine
himself
actuated
by
the
same
unreserved
affection
for
the
soldier
,
which
he
had
formerly
entertained
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
over
and
above
the
offence
he
had
taken
at
Pickle
's
omission
,
in
point
of
corresponding
with
him
,
had
been
informed
,
by
a
letter
from
his
mother
,
of
the
youth
's
cavalier
behaviour
to
Emilia
,
during
his
last
residence
at
Winchester
;
and
our
young
gentleman
(
as
we
have
already
observed
)
was
disgusted
at
the
supposed
discovery
which
the
soldier
had
made
,
in
his
absence
,
to
the
commodore
.
<EOS>
They
perceived
their
mutual
umbrage
at
meeting
,
and
received
each
other
with
that
civility
of
reserve
,
which
commonly
happens
between
two
persons
,
when
their
friendship
is
in
the
wane
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
at
once
divined
the
cause
of
the
other
's
displeasure
;
and
,
in
order
to
vindicate
his
own
character
,
after
the
first
compliments
were
passed
,
took
the
opportunity
of
inquiring
after
the
health
of
the
commodore
,
to
tell
Peregrine
,
that
while
he
tarried
at
the
garison
,
in
his
return
from
Dover
,
the
subject
of
the
conversation
,
one
night
,
happening
to
turn
on
our
hero
's
passion
,
the
old
gentleman
had
expressed
his
concern
about
that
affair
;
and
,
among
other
observations
,
said
,
he
supposed
the
object
of
his
love
was
some
paultry
hussy
,
whom
he
had
picked
up
when
he
was
a
boy
at
school
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
Mr
Hatchway
assured
him
,
that
she
was
a
young
woman
of
as
good
a
family
as
any
in
the
county
;
and
after
having
prepossessed
him
in
her
favour
,
ventured
(
out
of
the
zeal
of
his
friendship
)
to
tell
who
she
was
:
wherefore
,
the
discovery
was
not
to
be
imputed
to
any
other
cause
:
and
he
hoped
Mr
Pickle
would
acquit
him
of
all
share
in
the
transaction
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
very
well
pleased
to
be
thus
undeceived
;
his
countenance
immediately
cleared
up
,
the
formality
of
his
behaviour
relaxed
into
his
usual
familiarity
;
he
asked
pardon
for
his
unmannerly
neglect
of
Godfrey
's
letter
,
which
,
he
protested
,
was
not
owing
to
any
disregard
,
or
abatement
of
friendship
,
but
to
a
hurry
of
youthful
engagements
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
had
procrastinated
his
answer
from
time
to
time
,
until
he
was
ready
to
return
in
person
.
    
<EOS>
The
young
soldier
was
contented
with
this
apology
;
and
as
Pickle
's
intention
,
with
respect
to
his
sister
,
was
still
dubious
and
undeclared
,
he
did
not
think
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
,
as
yet
,
to
express
any
resentment
on
that
score
;
but
was
wise
enough
to
foresee
,
that
the
renewal
of
his
intimacy
with
our
young
gentleman
,
might
be
the
means
of
reviving
that
flame
which
had
been
dissipated
by
a
variety
of
new
ideas
.
<EOS>
With
those
sentiments
he
laid
aside
all
reserve
,
and
their
communication
immediately
resumed
its
former
channel
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
made
him
acquainted
with
all
the
adventures
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
since
their
parting
;
and
he
,
with
the
same
confidence
,
related
the
remarkable
incidents
of
his
own
fate
;
among
other
things
,
giving
him
to
understand
,
that
upon
obtaining
a
commission
in
the
army
,
the
father
of
his
dear
Sophy
,
without
once
inquiring
about
the
occasion
of
his
promotion
,
had
not
only
favoured
him
with
his
countenance
in
a
much
greater
degree
than
heretofore
,
but
also
contributed
his
interest
,
and
even
promised
the
assistance
of
his
purse
,
in
procuring
for
him
a
lieutenancy
,
which
he
was
then
soliciting
with
all
his
power
;
whereas
,
if
he
had
not
been
enabled
,
by
a
most
accidental
piece
of
good
fortune
,
to
lift
himself
into
the
sphere
of
an
officer
,
he
had
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
,
that
this
gentleman
,
and
all
the
rest
of
his
wealthy
relations
,
would
have
suffered
him
to
languish
in
obscurity
and
distress
;
and
,
by
turning
his
misfortune
into
reproach
,
made
it
a
plea
for
their
own
want
of
generosity
and
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
understanding
this
situation
of
his
friend
's
affairs
,
would
have
accommodated
him
,
upon
the
instant
,
with
a
sum
to
accelerate
the
passage
of
his
commission
through
the
offices
;
but
,
being
too
well
acquainted
with
his
scrupulous
disposition
,
to
manifest
his
benevolence
in
that
manner
,
he
found
means
to
introduce
himself
to
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
the
war
-
office
,
who
was
so
well
satisfied
with
the
arguments
he
used
in
behalf
of
his
friend
,
that
Godfrey
's
business
was
transacted
in
a
very
few
days
,
though
he
himself
knew
nothing
of
his
interest
's
being
thus
reinforced
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
season
at
Bath
was
begun
;
and
our
hero
,
panting
with
the
desire
of
distinguishing
himself
at
that
resort
of
the
fashionable
world
,
communicated
his
design
of
going
thither
to
his
friend
Godfrey
,
whom
he
importuned
to
accompany
him
in
the
excursion
:
and
leave
of
absence
from
his
regiment
being
obtained
,
by
the
influence
of
Peregrine
's
new
quality
-
friends
,
the
two
companions
departed
from
London
in
a
post
-
chaise
,
attended
,
as
usual
,
by
the
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
,
who
were
become
almost
as
necessary
to
our
adventurer
as
any
two
of
his
own
organs
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
inn
,
when
they
alighted
for
dinner
,
Godfrey
perceived
a
person
walking
by
himself
in
the
yard
,
with
a
very
pensive
air
,
and
upon
observing
him
more
narrowly
,
recognized
him
to
be
a
professed
gamester
,
whom
he
had
formerly
known
at
Tunbridge
.
<EOS>
On
the
strength
of
this
acquaintance
,
he
accosted
the
peripatetic
,
who
knew
him
immediately
;
and
,
in
the
fulness
of
his
grief
and
vexation
,
told
him
,
that
he
was
now
on
his
return
from
Bath
,
where
he
had
been
stripp'd
by
a
company
of
sharpers
,
who
resented
that
he
should
presume
to
trade
upon
his
own
bottom
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
extremely
curious
in
his
inquiries
,
imagining
that
he
might
learn
some
entertaining
and
useful
anecdotes
from
this
artist
,
invited
him
to
dinner
,
and
was
accordingly
fully
informed
of
all
the
political
systems
at
the
Bath
.
<EOS>
He
understood
,
that
there
was
at
London
one
great
company
of
adventurers
,
who
employed
agents
,
in
all
the
different
branches
of
imposition
,
throughout
the
whole
kingdom
of
England
,
allowing
these
ministers
a
certain
proportion
of
the
profits
accruing
from
their
industry
and
skill
,
and
reserving
the
greatest
share
for
the
benefit
of
the
common
stock
,
which
was
chargeable
with
the
expence
of
fitting
out
individuals
in
their
various
pursuits
,
as
well
as
with
the
loss
sustained
in
the
course
of
their
adventures
.
    
<EOS>
Some
,
whose
persons
and
qualifications
are
by
the
company
judged
adequate
to
the
task
,
exert
their
talents
in
making
love
to
ladies
of
fortune
,
being
accommodated
with
money
and
accoutrements
for
that
purpose
,
after
having
given
their
bonds
payable
to
one
or
other
of
the
directors
,
on
the
day
of
marriage
,
for
certain
sums
,
proportioned
to
the
dowries
they
are
to
receive
.
<EOS>
Others
,
versed
in
the
doctrine
of
chances
,
and
certain
secret
expedients
,
frequent
all
those
places
where
games
of
hazard
are
allowed
;
and
such
as
are
masters
in
the
arts
of
billiards
,
tennis
and
bowls
,
are
continually
lying
in
wait
,
in
all
the
scenes
of
these
diversions
,
for
the
ignorant
and
unwary
.
<EOS>
A
fourth

attend
horse
-
races
,
being
skilled
in
those
mysterious
practices
,
by
which
the
knowing

ones
are
taken
in
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
community
unfurnished
with
those
who
lay
wanton
wives
and
old
rich
widows
under
contribution
,
and
extort
money
,
by
prostituting
themselves
to
the
embraces
of
their
own
sex
,
and
then
threatening
their
admirers
with
prosecution
.
<EOS>
But
their
most
important
returns
are
made
by
that
body
of
their
undertakers
who
exercise
their
understandings
in
the
innumerable
stratagems
of
the
card
-
table
,
at
which
no
sharper
can
be
too
infamous
to
be
received
,
and
even
caressed
by
persons
of
the
highest
rank
and
distinction
.
<EOS>
Among
other
articles
of
intelligence
,
our
young
gentleman
learn'd
,
that
those
agents
,
by
whom
their
guest
was
broke
,
and
expelled
from
Bath
,
had
constituted
a
bank
against
all
sporters
,
and
monopolized
the
advantage
in
all
sorts
of
play
.
<EOS>
He
then
told
Gauntlet
,
that
if
he
would
put
himself
under
his
direction
,
he
would
return
with
them
,
and
lay
such
a
scheme
,
as
would
infallibly
ruin
the
whole
society
at
billiards
,
as
he
knew
that
Godfrey
excelled
them
all
in
his
knowledge
of
that
game
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
excused
himself
from
engaging
in
any
party
of
that
kind
;
and
after
dinner
the
travellers
parted
;
but
,
as
the
conversation
between
the
two
friends
turned
upon
the
information
they
had
received
,
Peregrine
projected
a
plan
for
punishing
those
villanous
pests
of
society
,
who
prey
upon
their
fellow
creatures
;
and
it
was
put
in
execution
by
Gauntlet
,
in
this
manner
.

Chapter
LXXIV
Godfrey
executes
a
scheme
at
Bath
,
by
which
a
whole
company
of
sharpers
is
ruined
.
   
<EOS>
On
the
evening
after
their
arrival
at
Bath
,
Godfrey
,
who
had
kept
himself
up
all
day
for
that
purpose
,
went
in
boots
to
the
billiard
table
;
and
two
gentlemen
being
at
play
,
began
to
bet
with
so
little
appearance
of
judgment
,
that
one
of
the
adventurers
then
present
was
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
profiting
by
his
inexperience
;
and
when
the
table
was
vacant
,
invited
him
to
take
a
game
for
amusement
.
<EOS>
The
soldier
,
assuming
the
air
of
a
self
-
conceited
dupe
,
answered
,
that
he
did
not
choose
to
throw
away
his
time
for
nothing
,
but
,
if
he
pleased
,
would
piddle
for
a
crown
a
game
.
<EOS>
This
declaration
was
very
agreeable
to
the
other
,
who
wanted
to
be
further
confirmed
in
the
opinion
he
had
conceived
of
the
stranger
,
before
he
would
play
for
any
thing
of
consequence
.
<EOS>
The
partie
being
accepted
,
Gauntlet
put
off
his
coat
,
and
beginning
with
seeming
eagerness
,
won
the
first
game
,
because
his
antagonist
kept
up
his
play
,
with
a
view
of
encouraging
him
to
wager
a
greater
sum
.
<EOS>
The
soldier
purposely
bit
at
the
hook
,
the
stakes
were
doubled
,
and
he
was
again
victorious
,
by
the
permission
of
his
competitor
.
    
<EOS>
He
now
began
to
yawn
;
and
observing
,
that
it
was
not
worth
his
while
to
proceed
in
such
a
childish
manner
,
the
other
swore
,
in
an
affected
passion
,
that
he
would
play
with
him
for
twenty
guineas
.
<EOS>
The
proposal
being
embraced
(
thro
'
the
connivance
of
Godfrey
)
<EOS>
the
money
was
won
by
the
sharper
,
who
exerted
his
dexterity
to
the
uttermost
,
fearing
that
otherwise
his
adversary
would
decline
continuing
the
game
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
thus
conquered
,
pretended
to
lose
his
temper
,
<EOS>
curs'd
his
own
ill
luck
,
swore
that
the
table
had
a
cast
,
and
that
the
balls
did
not
run
true
,
changed
his
mast
,
and
with
great
warmth
challenged
his
enemy
to
double
the
sum
.
<EOS>
The
gamester
,
with
feigned
reluctance
,
complied
with
his
desire
,
and
having
got
the
first
two
hazards
,
offered
to
lay
one
hundred
guineas
to
fifty
on
the
game
.
<EOS>
The
odds
were
taken
;
and
Godfrey
having
allowed
himself
to
be
overcome
,
began
to
rage
with
great
violence
,
broke
the
mast
to
pieces
,
threw
the
balls
out
at
the
window
,
and
,
in
the
fury
of
his
indignation
,
defied
his
antagonist
to
meet
him
to
-
morrow
,
when
he
should
be
refreshed
from
the
fatigue
of
travelling
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
very
welcome
invitation
to
the
gamester
,
who
imagining
that
the
soldier
would
turn
out
a
most
beneficial
prize
,
assured
him
,
that
he
would
not
fail
to
be
there
next
forenoon
,
in
order
to
give
him
his
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
went
home
to
his
lodgings
,
fully
certified
of
his
own
superiority
;
and
took
his
measures
with
Peregrine
,
touching
the
prosecution
of
their
scheme
;
while
his
opponent
made
a
report
of
his
success
to
the
brethren
of
the
gang
,
who
resolved
to
be
present
at
the
decision
of
the
match
,
with
the
view
of
taking
advantage
of
the
stranger
's
passionate
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
Affairs
being
thus
concerted
on
both
sides
,
the
players
met
,
according
to
appointment
,
and
the
room
was
immediately
filled
with
spectators
,
who
either
came
thither
by
accident
,
curiosity
,
or
design
.
<EOS>
The
match
was
fixed
for
one
hundred
pounds
a
game
,
the
principals
chose
their
instruments
,
and
laid
aside
their
coats
,
and
one
of
the
knights
of
the
order
proffered
to
lay
another
hundred
on
the
head
of
his
associate
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
took
him
up
on
the
instant
.
<EOS>
A
second
worthy
of
the
same
class
<EOS>
seeing
him
so
eager
,
challenged
him
to
treble
the
sum
;
and
his
proposal
met
with
the
same
reception
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
company
,
whose
expectation
was
raised
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
.
<EOS>
The
game
was
begun
,
and
the
soldier
having
lost
the
first
hazard
,
the
odds
were
offered
by
the
confederacy
,
with
great
vociferation
;
but
no
body
would
run
such
a
risk
,
in
favour
of
a
person
who
was
utterly
unknown
.
<EOS>
The
sharper
having
gained
the
second
also
,
the
noise
increased
to
a
surprising
clamour
,
not
only
of
the
gang
,
but
likewise
of
almost
all
the
spectators
,
who
desired
to
lay
two
to
one
against
the
brother
of
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
present
,
perceiving
the
cupidity
of
the
association
sufficiently
inflamed
,
all
of
a
sudden
opened
his
mouth
,
and
answered
their
betts
,
to
the
amount
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
;
which
were
immediately
deposited
,
on
both
sides
,
in
money
and
notes
:
so
that
this
was
(
perhaps
)
the
most
important
game
that
ever
was
plaid
at
billiards
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
seeing
the
agreement
settled
,
struck
his
antagonist
's
ball
into
the
pocket
,
in
a
twinkling
,
tho
'
it
was
in
one
of
those
situations
which
are
supposed
to
be
against
the
striker
.
<EOS>
The
betters
were
a
little
discomposed
at
this
event
,
for
which
,
however
,
they
consoled
themselves
,
by
imputing
the
success
to
accident
;
but
when
,
at
the
very
next
stroke
,
he
sprung
it
over
the
table
,
their
countenances
underwent
an
instantaneous
distraction
of
feature
,
and
they
waited
,
in
the
most
dreadful
suspense
,
for
the
next
hazard
,
which
being
likewise
taken
,
with
infinite
ease
,
by
the
soldier
,
the
blood
forsook
their
cheeks
,
and
the
interjection
Zounds
!
<EOS>
pronounced
with
a
look
of
consternation
,
and
in
a
tone
of
despair
,
proceeded
from
every
mouth
,
at
the
same
instant
of
time
.
<EOS>
They
were
overwhelmed
with
horror
and
astonishment
at
seeing
three
hazards
taken
in
as
many
strokes
,
from
a
person
of
their
friend
's
dexterity
;
and
shrewdly
suspected
,
that
the
whole
was
a
scheme
preconcerted
for
their
destruction
:
on
this
supposition
they
changed
the
note
,
and
attempted
to
effect
their
own
indemnification
,
by
proposing
to
lay
the
odds
in
favour
of
Gauntlet
;
but
so
much
was
the
opinion
of
the
company
altered
by
that
young
gentleman
's
success
,
that
no
body
would
venture
to
espouse
the
cause
of
his
competitor
,
who
chancing
to
improve
his
game
by
the
addition
of
another
lucky
hit
,
diminished
the
concern
,
and
revived
the
hopes
of
his
adherents
.
<EOS>
But
,
this
gleam
of
fortune
,
did
not
long
continue
:
Godfrey
collected
his
whole
art
and
capacity
,
and
augmenting
his
score
to
number
ten
,
indulged
himself
with
a
view
of
the
whole
fraternity
.
    
<EOS>
The
visages
of
these
professors
had
adopted
different
shades
of
complexion
,
at
every
hazard
he
had
taken
;
from
their
natural
colour
they
had
shifted
into
a
sallow
hue
;
from
thence
into
pale
;
from
pale
into
yellow
,
which
degenerated
into
a
mahogony
tint
;
and
now
they
saw
seventeen
hundred
pounds
of
their
stock
depending
upon
a
single
stroke
,
they
stood
like
so
many
swarthy
Moors
,
jaundiced
with
terror
and
vexation
.
<EOS>
The
fire
which
naturally
glowed
in
the
cheeks
and
nose
of
the
player
,
seemed
utterly
extinct
,
and
his
carbuncles
exhibited
a
livid
appearance
,
as
if
a
gangrene
had
already
made
some
progress
in
his
face
;
his
hand
began
to
shake
,
and
his
whole
frame
was
seized
with
such
trepidation
,
that
he
was
fain
to
swallow
a
bumper
of
brandy
,
in
order
to
re
-
establish
the
tranquillity
of
his
nerves
.
<EOS>
This
expedient
,
however
,
did
not
produce
the
desired
effect
;
for
he
aimed
the
ball
at
the
lead
with
such
discomposure
,
that
it
struck
on
the
wrong
side
,
and
came
off
at
an
angle
which
directed
it
full
in
the
middle
hole
.
<EOS>
This
fatal
accident
was
attended
with
an
universal
groan
,
as
if
the
whole
universe
had
gone
to
wreck
:
and
notwithstanding
that
tranquillity
for
which
adventurers
are
so
remarkable
,
this
loss
made
such
an
impression
upon
them
all
,
that
each
,
in
particular
,
manifested
his
chagrin
,
by
the
most
violent
emotions
.
<EOS>
One
turned
up
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
and
bit
his
nether
lip
;
another
gnawed
his
fingers
,
while
he
stalked
across
the
room
;
a
third
blasphemed
with
horrible
imprecations
;
and
he
who
played
the
partie
,
sneaked
off
,
grinding
his
teeth
together
,
with
a
look
that
baffles
all
description
,
and
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
,
exclaiming
,
"
A
damn'd
bite
,
by
G####d
!
"
    
<EOS>
The
victors
,
after
having
insulted
them
,
by
asking
if
they
were
disposed
for
another
chance
,
carried
off
their
winning
,
with
the
appearance
of
great
composure
,
though
in
their
hearts
they
were
transported
with
unspeakable
joy
;
not
so
much
on
account
of
the
booty
they
had
gained
,
as
in
consideration
of
having
so
effectually
destroyed
such
a
nest
of
pernicious
miscreants
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
believing
,
that
now
he
had
found
an
opportunity
of
serving
his
friend
,
without
giving
offence
to
the
delicacy
of
his
honour
,
told
him
,
upon
their
arrival
at
their
lodgings
,
that
fortune
had
at
length
enabled
him
to
become
in
a
manner
independent
,
or
at
least
to
make
himself
easy
in
his
circumstances
,
by
purchasing
a
company
with
the
money
he
had
won
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
put
his
share
of
the
success
in
Gauntlet
's
hand
,
as
a
sum
that
of
right
belonged
to
him
,
and
promised
to
write
in
his
behalf
to
a
nobleman
,
who
had
interest
enough
to
promote
such
a
quick
rise
in
the
service
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
thanked
him
for
his
obliging
intention
,
but
absolutely
refused
,
with
great
loftiness
of
demeanour
,
to
appropriate
to
his
own
use
any
part
of
the
money
which
Pickle
had
gained
,
and
seemed
affronted
at
the
other
's
entertaining
a
sentiment
so
unworthy
of
his
character
.
<EOS>
He
would
not
even
accept
,
in
the
way
of
loan
,
such
an
addition
to
his
own
stock
,
as
would
amount
to
the
price
of
a
company
of
foot
;
but
expressed
great
confidence
in
the
future
exertion
of
that
talent
which
had
been
blessed
with
such
a
prosperous
beginning
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
finding
him
thus
obstinately
deaf
to
the
voice
of
his
own
interest
,
resolved
to
govern
himself
in
his
next
endeavours
of
friendship
,
by
his
experience
of
this
ticklish
punctilio
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
gave
a
handsome
benefaction
to
the
hospital
,
out
of
these
first
fruits
of
his
success
in
play
,
and
reserved
two
hundred
pounds
for
a
set
of
diamond
ear
-
rings
and
solitaire
,
which
he
intended
for
a
present
to
Miss
Emily
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXV
<EOS>
The
two
friends
eclipse
all
their
competitors
in
gallantry
,
and
practise
a
pleasant
project
of
revenge
upon
the
physicians
of
the
place
.
   
<EOS>
The
fame
of
their
exploit
against
the
sharpers
,
was
immediately
diffused
through
all
companies
at
the
Bath
;
so
that
when
our
adventurers
appeared
in
public
,
they
were
pointed
out
by
an
hundred
extended
fingers
,
and
considered
as
consummate
artists
in
all
the
different
species
of
finesse
,
which
they
would
not
fail
to
practise
with
the
first
opportunity
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
opinion
of
their
characters
any
obstacle
to
their
reception
into
the
fashionable
parties
in
the
place
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
such
a
recommendation
,
which
(
as
I
have
already
hinted
)
never
fails
to
operate
for
the
advantage
of
the
possessor
.
    
<EOS>
This
first
adventure
,
therefore
,
served
them
as
an
introduction
to
the
company
at
Bath
,
who
were
not
a
little
surprized
to
find
their
expectations
baffled
by
the
conduct
of
the
two
companions
;
because
,
far
from
engaging
deeply
at
play
,
they
rather
shunned
all
occasions
of
gaming
,
and
directed
their
attention
to
gallantry
,
in
which
our
hero
shone
unrivalled
.
    
<EOS>
His
external
qualifications
,
exclusive
of
any
other
merit
,
were
strong
enough
to
captivate
the
common
run
of
the
female
sex
;
and
these
,
reinforced
with
a
sprightliness
of
conversation
,
and
a
most
insinuating
address
,
became
irresistible
,
even
by
those
who
were
fortified
with
pride
,
caution
or
indifference
.
<EOS>
But
,
among
all
the
nymphs
of
this
gay
place
,
he
did
not
meet
with
one
object
that
disputed
the
empire
of
his
heart
with
Emilia
;
and
therefore
he
divided
his
attachment
according
to
the
suggestions
of
vanity
and
whim
;
so
that
,
before
he
had
resided
a
fortnight
at
the
Bath
,
he
had
set
all
the
ladies
by
the
ears
,
and
furnished
all
the
hundred
tongues
of
scandal
with
full
employment
.
<EOS>
The
splendor
of
his
appearance
excited
the
inquiries
of
envy
,
which
,
instead
of
discovering
any
circumstance
to
his
prejudice
,
was
cursed
with
the
information
of
his
being
a
young
gentleman
of
a
good
family
,
and
heir
to
an
immense
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
The
countenance
of
some
of
his
quality
-
friends
,
who
arrived
at
Bath
,
confirmed
this
piece
of
intelligence
:
upon
which
,
his
acquaintance
was
courted
and
cultivated
with
great
assiduity
;
and
he
met
with
such
advances
from
some
of
the
fair
sex
,
as
rendered
him
extremely
fortunate
in
his
amours
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
friend
Godfrey
a
stranger
to
favours
of
the
same
kind
;
his
accomplishments
were
exactly
calculated
for
the
meridian
of
female
taste
;
and
with
certain
individuals
of
that
sex
,
his
muscular
frame
,
and
the
robust
connection
of
his
limbs
,
were
more
attractive
than
the
delicate
proportions
of
his
companion
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
reigned
paramount
among
those
inamorata
's
who
were
turned
of
thirty
,
without
being
under
the
necessity
of
proceeding
by
tedious
addresses
;
and
was
thought
to
have
cooperated
with
the
waters
,
in
removing
the
sterility
of
certain
ladies
,
who
had
long
undergone
the
reproach
and
disgust
of
their
husbands
:
while
Peregrine
set
up
his
throne
among
those
who
laboured
under
the
disease
of
celibacy
,
from
the
pert
miss
of
fifteen
,
who
,
with
a
fluttering
heart
,
tosses
her
head
,
bridles
up
,
and
giggles
involuntarily
at
sight
of
an
handsome
young
man
,
to
the
staid
maiden
of
twenty
-
eight
,
who
with
a
demure
aspect
moralizes
on
the
vanity
of
beauty
,
the
folly
of
youth
and
simplicity
of
woman
,
and
expatiates
on
friendship
,
benevolence
and
good
sense
,
in
the
stile
of
a
platonic
philosopher
.
    
<EOS>
In
such
a
diversity
of
dispositions
,
his
conquests
were
attended
with
all
the
heart
-
burnings
,
animosities
and
turmoils
of
jealousy
and
spite
.
<EOS>
The
younger
class
took
all
opportunities
of
mortifying
their
seniors
in
public
,
by
treating
them
with
that
indignity
which
(
contrary
to
the
general
privilege
of
age
)
is
by
the
consent
and
connivance
of
mankind
,
levelled
against
those
who
have
the
misfortune
to
come
under
the
denomination
of
old
maids
;
and
these
last
retorted
their
hostilities
in
the
private
machinations
of
slander
,
supported
by
experience
and
subtility
of
invention
.
<EOS>
Not
one
day
passed
,
in
which
some
new
story
did
not
circulate
,
to
the
prejudice
of
one
or
other
of
those
rivals
.
    
<EOS>
If
our
hero
,
in
the
long
-
room
,
chanced
to
quit
one
of
the
moralists
,
with
whom
he
had
been
engaged
in
conversation
,
he
was
immediately
accosted
by
a
number
of
the
opposite
faction
,
who
,
with
ironical
smiles
,
upbraided
him
with
cruelty
to
the
poor
lady
he
had
left
,
exhorted
him
to
have
compassion
on
her
sufferings
,
and
turning
their
eyes
towards
the
object
of
their
intercession
,
broke
forth
into
an
universal
peal
of
laughter
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
when
Peregrine
,
in
consequence
of
having
danced
with
one
of
the
minors
over
-
night
,
visited
her
in
the
morning
,
the
Platonists
immediately
laid
hold
on
the
occasion
,
tasked
their
imaginations
,
associated
ideas
,
and
in
sage
insinuations
retailed
a
thousand
circumstances
of
the
interview
,
which
never
had
any
foundation
in
truth
.
<EOS>
They
observed
,
that
if
girls
are
determined
to
behave
with
such
indiscretion
,
they
must
lay
their
accounts
with
incurring
the
censure
of
the
world
;
that
she
in
question
,
was
old
enough
to
act
more
circumspectly
;
and
wondered
that
her
mother
would
permit
any
young
fellow
to
approach
the
chamber
,
while
her
daughter
was
in
naked
bed
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
servant
's
peeping
through
the
key
-
hole
,
to
be
sure
it
was
an
unlucky
accident
;
but
people
ought
to
be
upon
their
guard
against
such
curiosity
,
and
give
their
domestics
no
cause
to
employ
their
penetration
.
<EOS>
These
,
and
other
such
reflections
,
were
occasionally
whispered
as
secrets
among
those
who
were
known
to
be
communicative
;
so
that
,
in
a
few
hours
,
it
became
the
general
topic
of
discourse
;
and
as
it
had
been
divulged
under
injunctions
of
secrecy
,
it
was
almost
impossible
to
trace
the
scandal
to
its
origin
;
because
every
person
concerned
,
must
have
promulgated
her
own
breach
of
trust
,
in
discovering
her
author
of
the
report
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
instead
of
allaying
,
rather
exasperated
this
contention
,
by
an
artful
distribution
of
his
attention
among
the
competitors
;
<EOS>
well
knowing
,
that
should
his
regard
be
converged
into
one
point
,
he
would
soon
forfeit
the
pleasure
he
enjoyed
,
in
seeing
them
at
variance
;
for
both
parties
would
join
against
the
common
enemy
,
and
his
favourite
would
be
persecuted
by
the
whole
coalition
.
    
<EOS>
He
perceived
,
that
among
the
secret
agents
of
scandal
,
none
were
so
busy
as
the
physicians
,
a
class
of
animals
who
live
in
this
place
,
like
so
many
ravens
hovering
about
a
carcase
,
and
even
ply
for
employment
,
like
scullers
at
Hungerford
-
stairs
.
<EOS>
The
greatest
part
of
them
have
correspondents
in
London
,
who
make
it
their
business
to
inquire
into
the
history
,
character
,
and
distemper
of
every
one
that
repairs
to
Bath
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
waters
;
and
if
they
can
not
procure
interest
to
recommend
their
medical
friends
to
these
patients
,
before
they
set
out
,
they
at
least
furnish
them
with
a
previous
account
of
what
they
could
collect
,
that
their
correspondents
may
use
this
intelligence
for
their
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
By
these
means
,
and
the
assistance
of
flattery
and
assurance
,
they
often
insinuate
themselves
into
the
acquaintance
of
strangers
,
and
by
consulting
their
dispositions
,
become
necessary
and
subservient
to
their
prevailing
passions
.
<EOS>
By
their
connexion
with
apothecaries
and
nurses
,
they
are
informed
of
all
the
private
occurrences
in
each
family
;
and
therefore
,
enabled
to
gratify
the
rancour
of
malice
,
amuse
the
spleen
of
peevish
indisposition
,
and
entertain
the
eagerness
of
impertinent
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
these
occupations
,
which
frequently
affected
the
reputation
of
our
two
adventurers
,
this
whole
body
fell
under
the
displeasure
of
our
hero
,
who
,
after
divers
consultations
with
his
friend
,
concerted
a
stratagem
,
which
was
practised
upon
the
faculty
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
Among
those
who
frequented
the
pumproom
,
was
an
old
officer
,
whose
temper
,
naturally
impatient
,
was
,
by
repeated
attacks
of
the
gout
,
which
had
almost
deprived
him
of
the
use
of
his
limbs
,
sublimated
into
a
remarkable
degree
of
virulence
and
perverseness
:
he
imputed
the
inveteracy
of
his
distemper
to
the
male
practice
of
a
surgeon
who
had
administered
to
him
,
while
he
laboured
under
the
consequences
of
an
unfortunate
amour
;
and
this
supposition
had
inspired
him
with
an
insurmountable
antipathy
to
all
the
professors
of
the
medical
art
,
which
was
more
and
more
confirmed
by
the
information
of
a
friend
at
London
,
who
had
told
him
,
that
it
was
a
common
practice
among
the
physicians
at
Bath
,
to
dissuade
their
patients
from
drinking
the
water
,
that
the
cure
,
and
of
consequence
their
attendance
,
might
be
the
longer
protracted
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
prepossessed
,
he
had
come
to
Bath
,
and
,
conformable
to
a
few
general
instructions
he
had
received
,
used
the
waters
without
any
farther
direction
,
taking
all
occasions
of
manifesting
his
hatred
and
contempt
of
the
sons
of
Aesculapius
,
both
by
speech
and
gesticulations
,
and
even
by
pursuing
a
regimen
quite
contrary
to
that
which
he
knew
they
prescribed
to
others
,
who
seemed
to
be
exactly
in
his
condition
.
<EOS>
But
he
did
not
find
his
account
in
this
method
,
how
successful
soever
it
may
have
been
in
other
cases
.
<EOS>
His
complaints
,
instead
of
vanishing
,
were
every
day
more
and
more
enraged
;
and
at
length
he
was
confined
to
his
bed
,
where
he
lay
blaspheming
from
morn
to
night
,
and
from
night
to
morn
,
though
still
more
determined
than
ever
to
adhere
to
his
former
maxims
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
his
torture
,
which
was
become
the
common
joke
of
the
town
,
being
circulated
through
the
industry
of
the
physicians
,
who
triumphed
in
his
disaster
;
Peregrine
,
by
means
of
Mr
Pipes
,
employed
a
country
-
fellow
,
who
had
come
to
market
,
to
run
with
great
haste
,
early
one
morning
,
to
the
lodgings
of
all
the
doctors
in
town
,
and
desire
them
to
attend
the
colonel
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
summons
,
the
whole
faculty
put
themselves
in
motion
;
and
three
of
the
foremost
arriving
at
the
same
instant
of
time
,
far
from
complimenting
one
another
with
the
door
,
each
separately
essayed
to
enter
,
and
the
whole
triumvirate
stuck
in
the
passage
.
<EOS>
While
they
remained
thus
wedged
together
,
they
descried
two
of
their
brethren
posting
towards
the
same
goal
,
with
all
the
speed
that
God
had
enabled
them
to
exert
;
upon
which
they
came
to
a
parley
,
and
agreed
to
stand
by
one
another
.
<EOS>
This
covenant
being
made
,
they
disentangled
themselves
,
and
inquiring
about
the
patient
,
were
told
by
the
servant
,
that
he
had
just
fallen
asleep
.
    
<EOS>
Having
received
this
intelligence
,
they
took
possession
of
his
anti
-
chamber
,
and
shut
the
door
,
while
the
rest
of
the
tribe
posted
themselves
on
the
outside
,
as
they
arrived
;
so
that
the
whole
passage
was
filled
,
from
the
top
of
the
stair
-
case
to
the
street
-
door
;
and
the
people
of
the
house
,
together
with
the
colonel
's
servant
,
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
three
leaders
of
this
learned
gang
had
no
sooner
made
their
lodgment
good
,
than
they
began
to
consult
about
the
patient
's
malady
,
which
every
one
of
them
pretended
to
have
considered
with
great
care
and
assiduity
.
<EOS>
The
first
who
gave
his
opinion
,
said
,
the
distemper
was
an
obstinate
Arthritis
;
the
second
affirmed
,
that
it
was
no
other
than
a
confirmed
pox
;
and
the
third
swore
it
was
an
inveterate
scurvy
.
    
<EOS>
This
diversity
of
opinions
was
supported
by
a
variety
of
quotations
from
medical
authors
,
ancient
as
well
as
modern
:
but
these
were
not
of
sufficient
authority
,
or
at
least
not
explicit
enough
to
decide
the
dispute
;
for
there
are
many
schisms
in
medicine
,
as
well
as
in
religion
,
and
each
sect
can
quote
the
fathers
,
in
support
of
the
tenets
they
profess
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
contention
rose
to
such
a
pitch
of
clamour
,
as
not
only
alarmed
their
brethren
on
the
stair
,
but
also
waked
the
patient
from
the
first
nap
he
had
enjoyed
in
the
space
of
ten
whole
days
.
<EOS>
Had
it
been
simply
waking
,
he
would
have
been
obliged
to
them
for
the
noise
that
disturbed
him
;
for
,
in
that
case
,
he
would
have
been
relieved
from
the
tortures
of
hell
-
fire
,
to
which
,
in
his
dream
,
he
fancied
himself
exposed
:
but
this
dreadful
vision
had
been
the
result
of
that
impression
which
was
made
upon
his
brain
,
by
the
intolerable
anguish
of
his
joints
;
so
that
,
when
he
waked
,
the
pain
,
instead
of
being
allayed
,
was
rather
aggravated
by
a
greater
acuteness
of
sensation
;
and
the
confused
vociferation
in
the
next
room
,
invading
his
ears
at
the
same
time
,
he
began
to
think
his
dream
was
realized
;
and
,
in
the
pangs
of
despair
,
applied
himself
to
a
bell
that
stood
by
his
bed
-
side
,
which
he
rung
with
great
violence
and
perseverance
.
    
<EOS>
This
alarm
put
an
immediate
stop
to
the
disputation
of
the
three
doctors
,
who
,
upon
this
notice
of
his
being
awake
,
rushed
into
his
chamber
without
ceremony
;
and
each
seizing
an
arm
,
the
third
made
the
like
application
to
one
of
his
temples
.
    
<EOS>
Before
the
patient
could
recollect
himself
from
the
amazement
which
had
laid
hold
on
him
,
at
this
unexpected
irruption
,
the
room
was
filled
by
the
rest
of
the
faculty
,
who
followed
the
servant
that
entered
,
in
obedience
to
his
master
's
call
;
and
the
bed
was
,
in
a
moment
,
surrounded
by
these
gaunt
ministers
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
colonel
,
seeing
himself
beset
with
such
an
assemblage
of
solemn
visages
and
figures
,
which
he
had
always
considered
with
the
utmost
detestation
and
abhorrence
,
was
incensed
to
a
most
inexpressible
degree
of
indignation
;
and
so
inspirited
by
his
rage
,
that
though
his
tongue
denied
its
office
,
his
other
limbs
performed
their
function
;
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
triumvirate
,
who
had
taken
possession
of
his
body
,
sprung
out
of
bed
with
incredible
agility
,
and
seizing
one
of
his
crutches
,
applied
it
so
effectually
to
one
of
the
three
,
just
as
he
stooped
to
examine
the
patient
's
water
,
that
his
tye
-
periwig
dropped
into
the
pot
,
while
he
himself
fell
motionless
on
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
This
significant
explanation
disconcerted
the
whole
fraternity
;
every
man
turned
his
face
,
as
if
it
were
by
instinct
,
towards
the
door
;
and
the
retreat
of
the
community
being
obstructed
by
the
efforts
of
individuals
,
confusion
and
tumultuous
uproar
ensued
:
for
the
colonel
,
far
from
limiting
his
prowess
to
the
first
exploit
,
handled
his
weapon
with
astonishing
vigour
and
dexterity
,
without
respect
of
persons
;
so
that
few
or
none
of
them
had
escaped
without
marks
of
his
displeasure
,
when
his
spirits
failed
,
and
he
sunk
down
again
,
quite
exhausted
,
on
his
bed
.
<EOS>
Favoured
by
this
respite
,
the
discomfited
faculty
collected
their
hats
and
wigs
,
which
had
fallen
off
in
the
fray
;
and
perceiving
the
assailant
too
much
enfeebled
to
renew
the
attack
,
set
up
their
throats
together
,
and
loudly
threatened
to
prosecute
him
severely
for
such
an
outrageous
assault
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
the
landlord
had
interposed
;
and
inquiring
into
the
cause
of
the
disturbance
,
was
informed
of
what
had
happened
by
the
complainants
,
who
,
at
the
same
time
,
giving
him
to
understand
,
that
they
had
been
severally
summoned
to
attend
the
colonel
that
morning
,
he
assured
them
,
that
they
had
been
imposed
upon
by
some
wag
;
for
his
lodger
had
never
<EOS>
dream'd
of
consulting
any
one
of
their
profession
.
    
<EOS>
Thunderstruck
at
this
declaration
,
the
general
clamour
instantaneously
ceased
;
and
each
,
in
particular
,
at
once
comprehending
the
nature
of
the
joke
,
they
sneaked
silently
off
with
the
loss
they
had
sustained
,
in
unutterable
shame
and
mortification
;
while
Peregrine
and
his
friend
,
who
took
care
to
be
passing
that
way
by
accident
,
made
a
full
stop
at
sight
of
such
an
extraordinary
efflux
,
and
enjoyed
the
countenance
and
condition
of
every
one
as
he
appeared
:
<EOS>
nay
,
even
made
up
to
some
of
those
who
seemed
most
affected
with
their
situation
,
and
mischievously
tormented
them
with
questions
touching
this
unusual
congregation
;
then
,
in
consequence
of
the
information
they
received
from
the
landlord
and
the
colonel
's
valet
,
subjected
the
sufferers
to
the
ridicule
of
all
the
company
in
town
.
<EOS>
As
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
the
authors
of
this
farce
to
keep
themselves
concealed
from
the
indefatigable
inquiries
of
the
physicians
,
they
made
no
secret
of
their
having
directed
the
whole
;
though
they
took
care
to
own
it
in
such
an
ambiguous
manner
,
as
afforded
no
handle
of
prosecution
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXVI
   
<EOS>
This
adventure
was
attended
with
another
small
tour
,
that
involved
almost
all
the
inhabitants
of
Bath
in
a
very
ludicrous
scene
of
distress
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
among
his
other
remarks
,
had
observed
,
that
in
this
place
there
was
no
such
utensil
as
a
jack
,
and
that
all
the
spits
were
turned
by
dogs
,
which
never
failed
to
appear
,
at
the
hour
of
employment
,
with
surprising
exactness
and
regularity
:
so
that
every
family
depended
with
great
confidence
upon
their
known
punctuality
,
without
taking
the
trouble
to
secure
them
before
-
hand
.
    
<EOS>
Our
companions
therefore
,
by
means
of
their
understrappers
,
who
employed
several
chairmen
for
the
purpose
,
apprehended
all
these
useful
animals
,
on
Saturday
at
night
,
and
confined
them
in
an
out
-
house
,
with
a
view
of
perplexing
the
people
with
regard
to
their
Sunday
's
dinner
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
they
disappointed
in
their
expectations
;
the
surloins
being
spitted
at
the
usual
time
,
the
cook
-
maid
appeared
at
every
door
almost
at
the
same
instant
;
and
after
having
earnestly
cast
their
eyes
around
,
they
began
to
run
about
the
street
,
and
whistle
with
great
vehemence
,
ejaculating
curses
between
whiles
against
the
innocent
curs
<EOS>
,
that
were
disabled
from
obeying
the
dictates
of
their
duty
.
    
<EOS>
Frivolous
as
this
circumstance
may
seem
to
be
<EOS>
,
it
was
here
considered
as
a
family
-
concern
of
some
consequence
;
for
the
maids
having
communicated
the
affair
to
their
respective
mistresses
,
every
house
in
a
twinkling
sent
forth
its
master
in
a
night
-
cap
,
slippers
,
and
morning
-
gown
,
in
order
to
find
some
remedy
for
this
dreadful
calamity
;
and
a
second
concert
of
whistling
was
performed
in
vain
.
<EOS>
They
even
assembled
in
committees
in
the
street
,
to
deliberate
on
this
unheard
-
of
defection
of
the
dogs
;
and
having
cudgelled
their
brains
to
no
purpose
,
returned
to
their
several
homes
,
in
manifest
terror
of
losing
a
favourite
meal
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
this
their
distraction
,
which
our
young
gentlemen
in
person
enjoyed
,
they
afterwards
understood
,
that
the
affliction
in
many
houses
was
increased
,
by
the
miscarriage
of
the
shifts
to
which
they
were
reduced
on
this
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
One
master
of
a
family
,
through
the
perverseness
of
his
servants
,
was
obliged
to
undertake
the
office
of
turnspit
in
propria
persona
,
to
the
destruction
of
his
appetite
,
and
the
danger
of
his
health
;
another
being
driven
to
the
necessity
of
cutting
the
roast
into
steaks
,
fell
sick
of
mortification
,
and
had
well
nigh
lost
his
wits
;
and
a
third
having
contrived
to
suspend
the
surloin
before
the
fire
,
in
order
to
be
twirled
about
by
the
hand
of
an
attendant
,
the
pack
-
thread
gave
way
towards
the
end
of
the
operation
,
and
the
meat
falling
down
,
discharged
the
contents
of
the
dripping
-
pan
upon
his
leg
,
which
was
scalded
in
a
miserable
manner
:
and
what
added
to
their
vexation
,
about
one
o'clock
,
when
the
disappointment
was
most
severely
felt
,
and
the
misfortune
irretrievable
,
Peregrine
ordered
the
prisoners
to
be
discharged
,
and
every
kitchen
was
visited
by
one
of
these
quadrupeds
,
as
if
they
had
come
on
purpose
to
insult
the
distress
they
had
occasioned
.
<EOS>
These
,
and
a
variety
of
other
stratagems
,
practised
upon
the
objects
of
ridicule
,
hatred
and
contempt
,
confirmed
and
augmented
the
reputation
of
our
adventurers
,
who
had
,
by
this
time
,
rendered
themselves
terrible
to
all
sorts
of
delinquents
of
both
sexes
,
from
the
brazen
-
fronted
gamester
and
female
libertine
,
to
the
stale
maiden
that
deals
in
scandal
and
strong
waters
,
and
the
puny
flutterer
,
who
seems
to
have
resigned
all
pretensions
to
manhood
.
<EOS>
Among
those
who
never
failed
to
reside
at
Bath
,
during
the
season
,
was
a
certain
person
,
who
,
from
the
most
abject
misery
,
had
by
his
industry
and
art
at
play
,
amassed
about
fifteen
thousand
pounds
;
and
though
his
character
was
notorious
,
insinuated
himself
so
far
into
the
favour
of
what
is
called
the
best
company
,
that
very
few
private
parties
of
pleasure
took
place
,
in
which
he
was
not
principally
concerned
.
<EOS>
He
was
of
a
gigantic
stature
,
a
most
intrepid
countenance
;
and
his
disposition
,
naturally
over
-
bearing
,
had
in
the
course
of
his
adventures
and
success
,
acquired
a
most
intolerable
degree
of
insolence
and
vanity
.
<EOS>
By
the
ferocity
of
his
features
,
and
audacity
of
his
behaviour
,
he
had
obtained
a
reputation
for
the
most
undaunted
courage
,
which
had
been
confirmed
by
divers
adventures
,
in
which
he
had
humbled
the
most
assuming
heroes
of
his
own
fraternity
;
so
that
he
now
reigned
chief
Hector
of
the
place
,
with
unquestioned
authority
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
son
of
fortune
was
Peregrine
one
evening
engaged
at
play
,
and
so
successful
,
that
he
could
not
help
informing
his
friend
of
his
good
luck
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
hearing
the
description
of
the
loser
,
immediately
recognized
the
person
,
whom
he
had
known
at
Tunbridge
;
and
assuring
Pickle
,
that
he
was
a
sharper
of
the
first
water
,
cautioned
him
against
any
future
connexion
with
such
a
dangerous
companion
,
who
(
he
affirmed
)
had
suffered
him
to
win
a
small
sum
,
that
he
might
be
encouraged
to
lose
a
much
greater
,
upon
some
other
occasion
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
treasured
up
this
advice
;
and
though
he
did
not
scruple
to
give
the
gamester
an
opportunity
of
retrieving
his
loss
,
when
he
next
day
demanded
his
revenge
,
he
absolutely
refused
to
proceed
,
after
he
had
refunded
his
winning
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
who
considered
him
as
a
hot
-
headed
unthinking
youth
,
endeavoured
to
inflame
his
pride
to
a
continuance
of
the
game
,
by
treating
his
skill
with
scorn
and
contempt
;
and
,
among
other
sarcastic
expressions
,
advising
him
to
go
to
school
again
,
before
he
pretended
to
engage
with
masters
of
the
art
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
incensed
at
his
arrogance
,
replied
with
great
warmth
,
that
he
knew
himself
sufficiently
qualified
for
playing
with
men
of
honour
,
who
deal
upon
the
square
,
and
hoped
he
should
always
deem
it
infamous
,
either
to
learn
or
practise
the
tricks
of
a
professed
gamester
.
"
<EOS>
Blood
and
thunder
!
<EOS>
meaning
me
,
Sir
?
<EOS>
(
cried
this
artist
,
raising
his
voice
,
and
curling
his
visage
into
a
most
intimidating
frown
.
)
<EOS>
Zounds
!
<EOS>
I
'll
cut
the
throat
of
any
scoundrel
who
has
the
presumption
to
suppose
,
that
I
do
n't
play
as
honourably
as
e'er
a
nobleman
in
the
kingdom
:
and
I
insist
upon
an
explanation
from
you
,
Sir
;
or
,
by
hell
and
brimstone
!
<EOS>
I
shall
expect
other
sort
of
satisfaction
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
(
whose
blood
by
this
time
boiled
within
him
)
answered
without
hesitation
;
"
Far
from
thinking
your
demand
unreasonable
,
I
will
immediately
explain
myself
without
reserve
,
and
tell
you
,
that
,
upon
unquestionable
authority
,
I
believe
you
to
be
an
impudent
rascal
and
common
cheat
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
Hector
was
so
amazed
and
confounded
at
the
freedom
of
this
declaration
,
which
he
thought
no
man
on
earth
would
venture
to
make
in
his
presence
,
that
for
some
minutes
he
could
not
recollect
himself
;
but
,
at
length
,
whispered
a
challenge
in
the
ear
of
our
hero
,
which
was
accordingly
accepted
.
<EOS>
When
they
arrived
next
morning
upon
the
field
,
the
gamester
,
arming
his
countenance
with
all
its
terrors
,
advanced
with
a
sword
of
a
monstrous
length
,
and
putting
himself
in
a
posture
,
called
aloud
in
a
most
terrific
voice
,
"
Draw
,
damn
ye
,
draw
;
I
will
this
instant
send
you
to
your
fathers
.
<EOS>
"
The
youth
was
not
slow
in
complying
with
his
desire
;
his
weapon
was
unsheathed
in
a
moment
,
and
he
began
the
attack
with
such
unexpected
spirit
and
address
,
that
his
adversary
,
having
made
shift
with
great
difficulty
to
parry
the
first
pass
,
retreated
a
few
paces
,
and
demanded
a
parley
,
in
which
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
the
young
man
,
that
to
lay
a
man
of
his
character
under
the
necessity
of
chastising
his
insolence
,
was
the
most
rash
and
inconsiderate
step
that
he
could
possibly
have
taken
;
but
,
that
he
had
compassion
upon
his
youth
,
and
was
willing
to
spare
him
,
if
he
would
surrender
his
sword
,
and
promise
to
ask
pardon
in
public
for
the
offence
he
had
given
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
was
so
much
exasperated
at
this
unparallelled
effrontery
,
that
,
without
deigning
to
make
the
least
reply
,
he
flung
his
own
hat
in
the
proposer
's
face
,
and
renewed
the
charge
with
such
undaunted
agility
,
that
the
gamester
,
finding
himself
in
manifest
hazard
of
his
life
,
betook
himself
to
his
heels
,
and
fled
homewards
with
incredible
speed
,
being
closely
pursued
by
Peregrine
,
who
having
sheathed
his
sword
,
pelted
him
with
stones
as
he
ran
,
and
compelled
him
to
go
,
that
same
day
,
into
banishment
from
Bath
,
where
he
had
domineered
so
long
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
atchievement
,
which
was
the
subject
of
astonishment
to
all
the
company
,
who
had
looked
upon
the
fugitive
as
a
person
of
heroic
courage
,
our
adventurer
's
reputation
was
rendered
formidable
in
all
its
circumstances
;
although
he
thereby
disobliged
a
good
many
people
of
fashion
,
who
had
contracted
an
intimacy
of
friendship
with
the
exile
,
and
who
resented
his
disgrace
,
as
if
it
had
been
the
misfortune
of
a
worthy
man
.
<EOS>
These
generous
patrons
,
however
,
bore
a
very
small
proportion
to
those
who
were
pleased
with
the
event
of
the
duel
;
because
,
in
the
course
of
their
residence
at
Bath
,
they
had
either
been
insulted
or
defrauded
by
the
challenger
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
instance
of
our
hero
's
courage
unacceptable
to
the
ladies
,
few
of
whom
could
now
resist
the
united
force
of
such
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
neither
he
nor
his
friend
Godfrey
would
have
found
much
difficulty
in
picking
up
an
agreeable
companion
for
life
;
but
Gauntlet
's
heart
was
preengaged
to
Sophy
;
and
Pickle
,
exclusive
of
his
attachment
to
Emily
,
which
was
stronger
than
he
himself
imagined
,
possessed
such
a
share
of
ambition
,
as
could
not
be
satisfied
with
the
conquest
of
any
female
he
beheld
at
Bath
.
    
<EOS>
His
visits
were
,
therefore
,
promiscuous
,
without
any
other
view
than
that
of
amusement
;
and
though
his
pride
was
flattered
by
the
advances
of
the
fair
whom
he
had
captivated
,
he
never
harboured
one
thought
of
proceeding
beyond
the
limits
of
common
gallantry
,
and
carefully
avoided
all
particular
explanations
.
<EOS>
But
,
what
above
all
other
enjoyments
yielded
him
the
most
agreeable
entertainment
,
was
the
secret
history
of
characters
,
which
he
learn'd
from
a
very
extraordinary
person
,
with
whom
he
became
acquainted
in
this
manner
.
    
<EOS>
Being
at
the
house
of
a
certain
lady
,
on
a
visiting
-
day
,
he
was
struck
with
the
appearance
of
an
old
man
,
who
no
sooner
entered
the
room
than
the
mistress
of
the
house
very
kindly
desired
one
of
the
wits
present
to
roast
the
old
put
.
<EOS>
This
petit
maitre
,
proud
of
the
employment
,
went
up
to
the
senior
,
who
had
something
extremely
peculiar
and
significant
in
his
countenance
,
and
saluting
him
with
divers
fashionable
conges
,
accosted
him
in
these
words
:
"
Your
servant
,
you
old
rascal
.
<EOS>
I
hope
to
have
the
honour
of
seeing
you
<EOS>
hang'd
.
<EOS>
I
vow
to
Gad
!
<EOS>
you
look
extremely
shocking
,
with
these
gummy
eyes
,
lanthorn
jaws
,
and
toothless
chaps
.
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
you
squint
at
the
ladies
<EOS>
,
you
old
rotten
medlar
?
<EOS>
Yes
,
yes
,
we
understand
your
ogling
;
but
you
must
content
yourself
with
a
cook
-
maid
,
sink
me
!
<EOS>
I
see
you
want
to
sit
.
<EOS>
These
wither'd
shanks
of
yours
tremble
under
their
burthen
:
<EOS>
but
you
must
have
a
little
patience
,
old
Hirco
;
indeed
you
must
.
<EOS>
I
intend
to
mortify
you
a
little
longer
,
curse
me
!
"
    
<EOS>
The
company
was
so
tickled
with
this
address
,
which
was
delivered
with
much
grimace
and
gesticulation
,
that
they
burst
out
into
a
loud
fit
of
laughter
,
which
they
fathered
upon
a
monkey
that
was
chained
in
the
room
;
and
when
the
peal
was
over
,
the
wit
renewed
his
attack
,
in
these
words
:
"
I
suppose
you
are
fool
enough
to
think
this
mirth
was
occasioned
by
Pug
:
<EOS>
ay
,
there
he
is
;
you
had
best
survey
him
;
he
is
of
your
own
family
,
switch
me
:
but
the
laugh
was
at
your
expence
;
and
you
ought
to
thank
heaven
for
making
you
so
ridiculous
.
<EOS>
"
While
he
uttered
these
ingenious
ejaculations
,
the
old
gentleman
bowed
alternately
to
him
and
the
monkey
,
that
seemed
to
grin
and
chatter
in
imitation
of
the
beau
,
and
with
an
arch
solemnity
of
visage
,
pronounced
,
"
Gentlemen
,
as
I
have
not
the
honour
to
understand
your
compliments
,
they
will
be
much
better
bestowed
on
each
other
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
seated
himself
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
to
see
the
laugh
returned
upon
the
aggressor
,
who
remained
confounded
and
abashed
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
left
the
room
,
muttering
,
as
he
retired
,
"
the
old
fellow
grows
scurrilous
,
stap
my
breath
.
"
    
<EOS>
While
Peregrine
wondered
in
silence
at
this
extraordinary
scene
,
the
lady
of
the
house
perceiving
his
surprize
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
the
ancient
visitant
was
utterly
bereft
of
the
sense
of
hearing
;
that
his
name
was
Cadwallader
Crabtree
;
his
disposition
altogether
misanthropical
;
and
that
he
was
admitted
into
company
on
account
of
the
entertainment
he
afforded
by
his
sarcastic
observations
,
and
the
pleasant
mistakes
to
which
he
was
subject
from
his
infirmity
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
our
hero
wait
a
long
time
for
an
illustration
of
this
odd
character
.
<EOS>
Every
sentence
he
spoke
was
replete
with
gall
;
nor
did
his
satire
consist
in
general
reflections
,
but
in
a
series
of
remarks
,
which
had
been
made
through
the
medium
of
a
most
whimsical
peculiarity
of
opinion
.
    
<EOS>
Among
those
who
were
present
at
this
assembly
was
a
young
officer
,
who
having
by
dint
of
interest
obtained
a
seat
in
the
lower
house
,
thought
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
talk
of
affairs
of
state
;
and
accordingly
regaled
the
company
with
an
account
of
a
secret
expedition
which
the
French
were
busied
in
preparing
;
assuring
them
,
that
he
had
it
from
the
mouth
of
the
minister
,
to
whom
it
had
been
transmitted
by
one
of
his
agents
abroad
.
<EOS>
In
descanting
upon
the
particulars
of
the
armament
,
he
observed
,
that
they
had
twenty
ships
of
the
line
,
ready
manned
and
victualled
at
Brest
,
which
were
destined
for
Toulon
,
where
they
would
be
joined
by
as
many
more
;
and
from
thence
proceed
to
the
execution
of
their
scheme
,
which
he
imparted
as
a
secret
not
fit
to
be
divulged
.
    
<EOS>
This
piece
of
intelligence
being
communicated
to
all
the
company
,
except
Mr
Crabtree
,
who
suffered
by
his
loss
of
hearing
,
that
cynic
was
soon
after
accosted
by
a
lady
,
who
,
by
means
of
an
artificial
alphabet
,
formed
by
a
certain
conjunction
and
disposition
of
the
fingers
,
asked
if
he
had
heard
any
extraordinary
news
of
late
?
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
with
his
usual
complaisance
,
replied
,
that
he
supposed
she
took
him
for
a
courier
or
spy
,
by
teizing
him
eternally
with
that
question
.
<EOS>
He
then
expatiated
upon
the
foolish
curiosity
of
mankind
,
which
,
he
said
,
must
either
proceed
from
idleness
or
want
of
ideas
;
and
repeated
almost
verbatim
the
officer
's
information
,
as
a
vague
ridiculous
report
,
invented
by
some
ignorant
coxcomb
,
who
wanted
to
give
himself
airs
of
importance
,
and
believed
only
by
those
who
were
utterly
unacquainted
with
the
politics
and
strength
of
the
French
nation
.
    
<EOS>
In
confirmation
of
what
he
had
advanced
,
he
endeavoured
to
demonstrate
how
impossible
it
must
be
for
that
people
to
fit
out
even
the
third
part
of
such
a
navy
,
so
soon
after
the
losses
they
had
sustained
during
the
war
;
and
confirmed
his
proof
by
asserting
,
that
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
the
harbours
of
Brest
and
Toulon
could
not
at
that
time
produce
a
squadron
of
eight
ships
of
the
line
.
    
<EOS>
The
member
,
who
was
an
utter
stranger
to
this
misanthrope
,
hearing
his
own
asseverations
treated
with
such
contempt
,
glowed
with
confusion
and
resentment
,
and
raising
his
voice
,
began
to
defend
his
own
veracity
with
great
eagerness
and
trepidation
,
mingling
with
his
arguments
many
blustering
invectives
against
the
insolence
and
ill
manners
of
his
supposed
contradictor
,
who
sat
with
the
most
mortifying
composure
of
countenance
,
till
the
officer
's
patience
was
quite
exhausted
;
and
then
,
to
the
manifest
increase
of
his
vexation
,
he
was
informed
,
that
his
antagonist
was
so
deaf
,
that
,
in
all
probability
,
the
last
trumpet
would
make
no
impression
upon
him
,
without
a
previous
renovation
of
his
organs
.

LXXVII
<EOS>
He
cultivates
an
acquaintance
with
the
Misanthrope
,
who
favours
him
with
a
short
sketch
of
his
own
history
.
   
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
extremely
well
pleased
at
this
occasional
rebuke
,
which
occurred
so
seasonably
,
that
he
could
scarce
believe
it
accidental
.
    
<EOS>
He
looked
upon
Cadwallader
as
the
greatest
curiosity
he
had
ever
known
,
and
cultivated
the
old
man
's
acquaintance
with
such
insinuating
address
,
that
in
less
than
a
fortnight
he
obtained
his
confidence
;
and
as
they
one
day
walked
into
the
fields
together
,
the
Manhater
disclos'd
himself
,
in
these
words
:
<EOS>
"
Tho
'
the
term
of
our
communication
has
been
but
short
,
you
must
have
perceived
,
that
I
treat
you
with
uncommon
marks
of
regard
;
which
,
I
assure
you
,
is
not
owing
to
your
personal
accomplishments
,
nor
the
pains
you
take
to
oblige
me
;
for
the
first
I
overlook
,
and
the
last
I
see
through
:
but
there
is
something
in
your
disposition
which
indicates
a
rooted
contempt
for
the
world
,
and
I
understand
you
have
made
some
successful
efforts
,
in
exposing
one
part
of
it
to
the
ridicule
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
It
is
upon
this
assurance
,
that
I
offer
you
my
advice
and
assistance
,
in
prosecuting
other
schemes
of
the
same
nature
;
and
to
convince
you
that
such
an
alliance
is
not
to
be
rejected
,
I
will
now
give
you
a
short
sketch
of
my
history
,
which
will
be
published
after
my
death
,
in
forty
seven
volumes
of
my
own
compiling
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
born
about
forty
miles
from
this
place
,
of
parents
who
having
a
very
old
family
-
name
to
support
,
bestowed
their
whole
fortune
on
my
elder
brother
;
so
that
I
inherited
of
my
father
little
else
than
a
large
share
of
choler
,
to
which
I
am
indebted
for
a
great
many
adventures
that
did
not
always
end
to
my
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
age
of
eighteen
I
was
sent
up
to
town
,
with
a
recommendation
to
a
certain
peer
,
who
found
means
to
amuse
me
with
the
promise
of
a
commission
,
for
seven
whole
years
;
and
'
tis
odds
<EOS>
but
I
should
have
made
my
fortune
by
my
perseverance
,
had
not
I
been
arrested
,
and
thrown
into
the
Marshalsea
by
my
landlord
,
on
whose
credit
I
had
subsisted
three
years
,
after
my
father
had
renounced
me
as
an
idle
vagabond
.
<EOS>
There
I
remained
six
months
,
among
those
prisoners
who
have
no
other
support
than
chance
charity
;
and
contracted
a
very
valuable
acquaintance
,
which
was
of
great
service
to
me
in
the
future
emergencies
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
no
sooner
discharged
,
in
consequence
of
an
act
of
parliament
for
the
relief
of
insolvent
debtors
,
than
I
went
to
the
house
of
my
creditor
,
whom
I
cudgelled
without
mercy
;
and
that
I
might
leave
nothing
undone
of
those
things
which
I
ought
to
have
done
,
my
next
stage
was
to
Westminster
-
hall
,
where
I
waited
until
my
patron
came
forth
from
the
house
,
and
saluted
him
with
a
blow
that
laid
him
senseless
on
the
pavement
:
but
my
retreat
was
not
so
fortunate
as
I
could
have
wished
,
the
chairmen
and
lacquies
in
waiting
having
surrounded
and
disarmed
me
in
a
trice
,
I
was
committed
to
Newgate
,
and
loaded
with
chains
;
and
a
very
sagacious
gentleman
,
who
was
afterwards
hanged
,
having
sat
in
judgment
upon
my
case
,
pronounced
me
guilty
of
a
capital
crime
,
and
foretold
my
condemnation
at
the
Old
Baily
.
<EOS>
His
prognostic
,
however
,
was
disappointed
;
for
no
body
appearing
to
prosecute
me
at
the
next
sessions
,
I
was
discharged
,
by
order
of
the
court
.
<EOS>
It
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
recount
,
in
the
compass
of
one
day
's
conversation
,
<EOS>
all
the
particular
exploits
in
which
I
bore
a
considerable
share
:
suffice
it
to
say
,
I
have
been
,
at
different
times
,
prisoner
in
all
the
jails
within
the
bills
of
mortality
.
<EOS>
I
have
broke
from
every
round
-
house
on
this
side
Temple
-
bar
.
    
<EOS>
No
bailiff
,
in
the
days
of
my
youth
and
desperation
,
durst
execute
a
writ
upon
me
without
a
dozen
followers
;
and
the
justices
themselves
trembled
when
I
was
brought
before
them
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
once
maimed
by
a
carman
,
with
whom
I
quarrelled
,
because
he
ridiculed
my
leek
on
St
David
's
day
;
my
skull
was
fractured
by
a
butcher
's
cleaver
,
on
the
like
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
have
been
run
thro
'
the
body
five
times
,
and
lost
the
tip
of
my
left
ear
by
a
pistol
bullet
.
<EOS>
In
a
rencounter
of
this
kind
,
having
left
my
antagonist
for
dead
,
I
was
wise
enough
to
make
my
retreat
into
France
;
and
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
at
Paris
entering
into
conversation
with
some
officers
on
the
subject
of
politics
,
a
dispute
arose
,
in
which
I
lost
my
temper
,
and
spoke
so
irreverently
of
the
Grand
Monarque
,
that
next
morning
I
was
sent
to
the
bastile
,
by
virtue
of
a
Lettre
de
Cachet
.
<EOS>
There
I
remained
for
some
months
,
deprived
of
all
intercourse
with
rational
creatures
;
a
circumstance
for
which
I
was
not
sorry
,
as
I
had
the
more
time
to
project
schemes
of
revenge
against
the
tyrant
who
confined
me
,
and
the
wretch
who
had
betrayed
my
private
conversation
:
but
tired
,
at
length
,
with
these
fruitless
suggestions
,
I
was
fain
to
unbend
the
severity
of
my
thoughts
by
a
correspondence
with
some
industrious
spiders
,
who
had
hung
my
dungeon
with
their
ingenious
labours
.
    
<EOS>
I
considered
their
work
with
such
attention
,
that
I
soon
became
an
adept
in
the
mystery
of
weaving
,
and
furnished
myself
with
as
many
useful
observations
and
reflections
on
that
art
,
as
will
compose
a
very
curious
treatise
,
which
I
intend
to
bequeath
to
the
Royal
Society
,
for
the
benefit
of
our
woolen
manufacture
;
and
this
with
a
view
to
perpetuate
my
own
name
,
rather
than
befriend
my
country
:
for
,
thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
I
am
weaned
from
all
attachments
of
that
kind
,
and
look
upon
myself
as
one
very
little
obliged
to
any
society
whatsoever
.
<EOS>
Although
I
presided
with
absolute
power
over
this
long
-
legg'd
community
,
and
distributed
rewards
and
punishments
to
each
,
according
to
his
deserts
,
I
grew
impatient
of
my
situation
;
and
my
natural
disposition
,
one
day
,
prevailing
,
like
a
fire
which
had
long
been
smothered
,
I
wreaked
the
fury
of
my
indignation
upon
my
innocent
subjects
,
and
in
a
twinkling
destroyed
the
whole
race
.
<EOS>
While
I
was
employed
in
this
general
massacre
,
the
turnkey
,
who
brought
me
food
,
opening
the
door
,
and
perceiving
my
transport
,
shrugged
up
his
shoulders
,
and
leaving
my
allowance
,
went
out
,
pronouncing
,
Le
pauvre
diable
!
<EOS>
la
tete
lui
tourne
.
<EOS>
My
passion
no
sooner
subsided
than
I
resolved
to
profit
by
this
opinion
of
the
jailor
,
and
from
that
day
counterfeited
lunacy
with
such
success
,
that
in
less
than
three
months
I
was
delivered
from
the
bastile
,
and
sent
to
the
gallies
,
in
which
they
thought
my
bodily
vigour
might
be
of
service
,
although
the
faculties
of
my
mind
were
decayed
.
<EOS>
Before
I
was
chained
to
the
oar
,
I
received
three
hundred
stripes
by
way
of
welcome
,
that
I
might
thereby
be
rendered
more
tractable
,
notwithstanding
I
used
all
the
arguments
in
my
power
to
persuade
them
,
I
was
only
mad
north
,
north
west
,
and
when
the
wind
was
southerly
,
knew
a
hawk
from
an
hand
-
saw
.
    
<EOS>
In
our
second
cruize
we
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
overtaken
by
a
tempest
,
during
which
the
slaves
were
unbound
,
that
they
might
contribute
the
more
to
the
preservation
of
the
galley
,
and
have
a
chance
for
their
lives
,
in
case
of
a
shipwreck
.
<EOS>
We
were
no
sooner
at
liberty
,
than
making
ourselves
masters
of
the
vessel
,
we
robbed
the
officers
,
and
ran
her
on
shore
among
rocks
on
the
coast
of
Portugal
;
from
whence
I
hastened
to
Lisbon
,
with
a
view
of
obtaining
my
passage
in
some
ship
bound
for
England
,
where
,
by
this
time
,
I
hoped
my
affair
would
be
forgotten
.
    
<EOS>
But
before
this
scheme
could
be
accomplished
,
my
evil
genius
led
me
into
company
;
and
being
intoxicated
,
I
began
to
broach
doctrines
on
the
subject
of
religion
,
at
which
some
of
the
partie
were
scandalized
and
incensed
;
and
I
was
next
day
dragged
out
of
bed
by
the
officers
of
the
inquisition
,
and
conveyed
to
a
cell
in
the
prison
belonging
to
that
tribunal
.
    
<EOS>
At
my
first
examination
my
resentment
was
strong
enough
to
support
me
under
the
torture
,
which
I
endured
without
flinching
;
but
my
resolution
abated
,
and
my
zeal
immediately
cooled
,
when
I
understood
from
a
fellow
-
prisoner
,
who
groaned
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
,
that
in
a
short
time
there
would
be
an
Auto
da
Fe
;
in
consequence
of
which
I
would
,
in
all
probability
,
be
doomed
to
the
flames
,
if
I
would
not
renounce
my
heretical
errors
,
and
submit
to
such
penance
as
the
church
should
think
fit
to
prescribe
.
<EOS>
This
miserable
wretch
was
convicted
of
Judaism
,
which
he
had
privately
practised
,
by
connivance
,
for
many
years
,
until
he
had
amassed
a
fortune
sufficient
to
attract
the
regard
of
the
church
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
he
fell
a
sacrifice
,
and
accordingly
prepared
himself
for
the
stake
;
while
I
,
not
at
all
ambitious
of
the
crown
of
martyrdom
,
resolved
to
temporize
:
so
that
,
when
I
was
brought
to
the
question
the
second
time
,
I
made
a
solemn
recantation
;
and
,
as
I
had
no
worldly
fortune
to
obstruct
my
salvation
,
was
received
into
the
bosom
of
the
church
,
and
,
by
way
of
penance
,
enjoined
to
walk
barefoot
to
Rome
,
in
the
habit
of
a
pilgrim
.
    
<EOS>
During
my
peregrination
thro
'
Spain
,
I
was
detained
as
a
spy
,
until
I
could
procure
credentials
from
the
inquisition
at
Lisbon
;
and
behaved
with
such
resolution
and
reserve
,
that
,
after
being
released
,
I
was
deemed
a
proper
person
to
be
employed
in
quality
of
a
secret
intelligencer
,
at
a
certain
court
.
<EOS>
This
office
I
undertook
,
without
hesitation
;
and
being
furnished
with
money
and
bills
of
credit
,
crossed
the
Pyrenees
,
with
intention
to
revenge
myself
upon
the
Spaniard
for
the
severities
I
had
undergone
,
during
my
captivity
.
    
<EOS>
Having
therefore
effectually
disguised
myself
,
by
a
change
of
dress
,
and
a
large
patch
on
one
eye
,
I
hired
an
equipage
,
and
appeared
at
Bologna
,
in
quality
of
an
itinerant
physician
;
in
which
capacity
I
succeeded
tolerably
well
,
till
my
servants
decamped
in
the
night
,
with
my
baggage
,
and
left
me
in
the
condition
of
Adam
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
have
travelled
over
the
greatest
part
of
Europe
,
as
a
beggar
,
pilgrim
,
priest
,
soldier
,
gamester
,
and
quack
;
and
felt
the
extremes
of
indigence
and
opulence
,
with
the
inclemency
of
weather
,
in
all
its
vicissitudes
.
<EOS>
I
have
learned
that
the
characters
of
mankind
are
every
where
the
same
;
that
common
sense
and
honesty
bear
an
infinitely
small
proportion
to
folly
and
vice
;
and
that
life
is
at
best
a
paulty
province
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
suffered
innumerable
hardships
,
dangers
,
and
disgraces
,
I
returned
to
London
,
where
I
lived
some
years
in
a
garret
,
and
picked
up
a
subsistence
,
such
as
it
was
,
by
vending
purges
in
the
streets
,
from
the
back
of
a
pied
horse
;
in
which
situation
I
used
to
harrangue
the
mob
,
in
broken
English
,
under
pretence
of
being
an
High
German
doctor
.
    
<EOS>
At
last
an
uncle
died
,
by
whom
I
inherit
an
estate
of
three
hundred
pounds
per
annum
,
tho
'
,
<EOS>
in
his
life
-
time
,
he
would
not
have
parted
with
a
six
-
pence
,
to
save
my
soul
and
body
from
perdition
.
    
<EOS>
I
now
appear
in
the
world
,
not
as
a
member
of
any
community
,
or
what
is
called
a
social
creature
;
but
merely
as
a
spectator
,
who
entertains
himself
with
the
grimaces
of
a
jack
-
pudding
,
and
banquets
his
spleen
in
beholding
his
enemies
at
loggerheads
.
<EOS>
That
I
may
enjoy
this
disposition
,
abstracted
from
all
interruption
,
danger
,
and
participation
,
I
feign
myself
deaf
;
an
expedient
by
which
I
not
only
avoid
all
disputes
,
and
their
consequences
,
but
also
become
master
of
a
thousand
little
secrets
,
<EOS>
which
are
every
day
whispered
in
my
presence
,
without
any
suspicion
of
their
being
overheard
.
<EOS>
You
saw
how
I
handled
that
shallow
politician
at
my
lady
<EOS>
Plausible
's
the
other
day
.
<EOS>
The
same
method
I
practise
upon
the
crazed
tory
,
the
bigot
whig
,
the
sour
supercilious
pedant
,
the
petulant
critic
,
the
blustering
coward
,
the
fawning
tool
,
the
pert
pimp
,
sly
sharper
,
and
every
other
species
of
knaves
and
fools
with
which
this
kingdom
abounds
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
my
rank
and
character
I
obtain
free
admission
to
the
ladies
,
among
whom
I
have
obtained
the
appellation
of
the
Scandalous
Chronicle
;
and
as
I
am
considered
(
while
silent
)
in
no
other
light
than
that
of
a
footstool
or
elbow
chair
,
they
divest
their
conversation
of
all
restraint
before
me
,
and
gratify
my
sense
of
hearing
with
strange
things
,
which
(
if
I
could
prevail
upon
myself
to
give
the
world
that
satisfaction
)
would
compose
a
curious
piece
of
secret
history
,
and
exhibit
a
quite
different
idea
of
characters
from
what
is
commonly
entertained
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
young
gentleman
,
you
may
perceive
,
that
I
have
it
in
my
power
to
be
a
valuable
correspondent
;
and
that
it
will
be
your
interest
to
deserve
my
confidence
.

Chapter
LXXVIII
<EOS>
A
treaty
is
concluded
betwixt
Cadwallader
and
our
hero
;
in
consequence
of
which
divers
pleasant
adventures
occur
,
until
the
young
gentleman
is
summoned
to
the
garison
on
a
very
interesting
occasion
.
   
<EOS>
Here
the
Misanthrope
left
off
speaking
,
desirous
to
know
the
sentiments
of
our
hero
,
who
embraced
the
proffered
alliance
,
in
a
transport
of
joy
and
surprize
;
and
the
treaty
was
no
sooner
concluded
than
Mr
Crabtree
began
to
perform
articles
,
by
imparting
to
him
a
thousand
delicious
secrets
,
from
the
possession
of
which
he
promised
himself
innumerable
scenes
of
mirth
and
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
By
means
of
this
associate
,
whom
he
considered
as
the
ring
of
Gyges
,
he
foresaw
that
he
should
be
enabled
to
penetrate
not
only
into
the
chambers
but
even
to
the
inmost
thoughts
of
the
female
sex
;
and
,
in
order
to
ward
off
suspicion
,
they
agreed
to
revile
each
other
in
public
,
and
meet
at
a
certain
private
rendezvous
,
to
communicate
their
mutual
discoveries
,
and
concert
their
future
operations
.
<EOS>
So
precious
did
Peregrine
esteem
this
treasure
,
that
he
would
not
even
make
his
friend
Godfrey
acquainted
with
his
good
fortune
,
tho
'
the
first
use
he
made
of
it
,
was
in
behalf
of
that
young
gentleman
,
whom
he
undeceived
in
two
very
interesting
particulars
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
's
addresses
were
,
at
that
time
,
shared
betwixt
two
ladies
,
who
received
them
in
a
very
different
manner
.
<EOS>
By
one
of
them
he
was
caress'd
with
marks
of
particular
regard
,
and
by
small
favours
flattered
with
the
expectation
of
supreme
success
;
while
the
other
treated
him
with
such
severity
and
shyness
,
that
he
could
never
find
an
opportunity
or
resolution
to
make
an
unrestricted
declaration
of
his
flame
.
<EOS>
As
every
woman
has
a
confidant
,
to
whom
she
pours
forth
her
heart
on
these
occasions
,
Mr
Crabtree
happened
to
be
present
when
each
of
them
disburthened
herself
of
her
sentiments
with
regard
to
her
lover
;
and
learned
from
their
own
confessions
,
that
the
frank
lady
cajoled
him
for
the
sake
of
the
money
which
he
suffered
himself
to
lose
at
cards
,
though
she
had
not
the
least
intention
to
extend
her
complaisance
beyond
the
limits
of
exterior
civilities
;
while
the
prude
was
actually
enamoured
of
his
person
,
and
through
a
remnant
of
modesty
avoided
him
for
no
other
reason
,
but
because
she
knew
herself
incapable
of
resisting
his
sollicitations
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Gauntlet
profited
by
this
discovery
,
which
was
communicated
to
him
through
the
canal
of
his
friend
,
relinquished
the
mercenary
coquet
,
and
found
means
to
vanquish
the
reserve
of
the
other
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
himself
was
,
in
like
manner
,
set
to
rights
,
in
certain
opinions
he
had
conceived
of
his
own
influence
with
particular
ladies
;
and
as
no
person
ever
offended
him
with
impunity
,
he
projected
a
scheme
of
vengeance
against
a
remarkable
inamorato
,
who
to
his
assiduities
preferred
those
of
a
brawny
fellow
,
that
,
from
the
place
of
a
private
trooper
in
the
horse
-
guards
,
had
been
preferred
to
the
rank
of
a
lieutenant
,
by
the
interest
of
a
dowager
lately
deceased
.
<EOS>
With
this
favourite
did
the
lady
make
an
assignation
,
in
the
hearing
of
Cadwallader
,
who
gave
our
hero
to
understand
,
that
he
was
to
be
received
by
her
woman
,
in
the
dark
,
at
a
parlour
-
door
that
opened
into
a
small
garden
,
the
wall
of
which
he
could
easily
overleap
,
after
the
servants
should
be
retired
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
fraught
with
this
intelligence
,
resolved
to
anticipate
his
rival
;
and
accordingly
,
by
the
ministration
of
his
companion
,
engaged
a
couple
of
stout
chairmen
,
who
being
posted
on
the
spot
,
seized
the
lover
in
his
endeavours
to
surmount
the
wall
,
and
conveyed
him
to
a
place
of
confinement
,
on
pretence
of
supposing
his
design
was
to
rob
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
secured
in
this
manner
,
than
Pickle
,
being
determined
to
prosecute
the
adventure
,
transported
himself
into
the
garden
,
and
personating
the
lieutenant
,
went
to
the
door
,
made
the
signal
which
had
been
agreed
upon
,
was
admitted
by
the
attendant
,
conducted
to
her
lady
's
apartment
<EOS>
,
that
was
darkened
for
her
reception
;
and
having
enjoyed
his
revenge
,
with
every
circumstance
of
satisfaction
,
made
his
retreat
before
day
,
without
being
discovered
,
after
having
been
gratified
with
a
valuable
ring
,
as
a
testimony
of
her
ladyship
's
affection
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
while
the
disappointed
captive
finding
himself
involved
in
a
troublesome
affair
,
that
must
end
either
in
his
own
disgrace
,
or
in
that
of
his
mistress
,
whom
he
could
not
with
honour
expose
,
employed
all
his
art
in
tampering
with
his
detainers
,
who
pretended
to
have
detected
him
as
they
passed
that
way
by
accident
,
and
who
would
not
listen
to
the
terms
he
proposed
for
his
release
until
it
was
almost
day
;
and
then
,
by
the
permission
of
their
employers
,
they
set
him
at
liberty
,
in
consideration
of
five
guineas
,
which
he
divided
between
them
.
<EOS>
From
the
time
of
his
discharge
he
waited
with
the
utmost
impatience
for
the
hour
of
breakfast
,
and
when
it
approached
hied
him
to
the
house
of
his
Dulcinea
,
with
a
view
of
excusing
himself
for
the
breach
of
punctuality
he
was
obliged
to
commit
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
confounded
at
the
air
of
satisfaction
and
complacency
that
manifested
itself
in
the
lady
's
appearance
;
but
believing
it
was
no
other
than
affectation
,
to
conceal
her
inward
disquiet
and
chagrin
,
he
assumed
a
most
dejected
look
,
and
with
many
expressions
of
mortification
recounted
the
cursed
accident
which
had
disabled
him
from
reaping
the
delicious
fruits
of
his
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
The
nymph
,
who
was
not
all
subject
to
the
vulgar
symptoms
of
confusion
,
hearing
this
circumstantial
detail
,
fixed
her
eyes
upon
the
soldier
's
countenance
,
and
regarding
him
attentively
for
some
minutes
;
"
If
this
declaration
(
said
she
)
be
an
effort
of
your
delicacy
,
you
may
spare
such
ridiculous
reserve
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
When
things
are
come
to
a
certain
pass
,
such
ceremony
is
superfluous
and
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
But
perhaps
you
remember
your
good
fortune
with
regret
,
and
actually
wish
you
had
met
with
that
adventure
<EOS>
you
have
been
at
such
pains
to
feign
,
rather
than
have
enjoyed
so
cheap
a
conquest
.
<EOS>
Indeed
you
was
so
impatient
to
be
gone
before
morning
,
that
you
seemed
rather
tired
of
your
stay
,
than
sollicitous
about
my
reputation
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
trooper
,
amazed
and
alarmed
at
this
unexpected
address
,
swore
with
many
vulgar
execrations
,
that
he
could
prove
he
was
in
custody
from
twelve
till
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
and
that
he
began
to
perceive
he
had
been
finely
flung
by
some
rascal
,
who
had
visited
her
in
his
place
.
<EOS>
He
even
hinted
a
suspicion
,
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
transacted
by
her
connivance
;
and
became
extremely
rough
and
unmannerly
in
his
expostulations
:
so
that
the
lady
,
who
had
more
of
the
tygress
than
of
the
lamb
in
her
disposition
,
being
exasperated
at
the
freedom
of
his
behaviour
,
ordered
him
down
stairs
,
and
(
to
use
the
common
phrase
)
forbad
him
her
house
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
retired
,
not
without
many
invectives
and
threats
,
which
he
bawled
aloud
in
his
march
;
while
his
incensed
patroness
,
by
this
time
sensible
that
she
had
been
the
dupe
of
some
stratagem
,
remained
in
a
state
of
unspeakable
anxiety
and
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
Being
blessed
,
however
,
with
a
great
share
of
penetration
,
she
forthwith
set
it
at
work
;
and
,
after
some
recollection
,
concluded
that
the
substitute
could
be
no
other
than
Peregrine
,
who
had
either
learned
the
circumstance
of
the
assignation
from
her
maid
,
or
extracted
them
from
the
vanity
and
indiscretion
of
the
gallant
himself
.
    
<EOS>
Now
that
she
had
an
opportunity
of
being
acquainted
with
all
our
young
gentleman
's
qualifications
,
she
did
not
repine
at
the
qui
pro
quo
which
had
been
played
upon
her
,
and
resolved
to
transfer
her
good
graces
to
Peregrine
,
without
reserve
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
she
favoured
him
with
the
most
palpable
advances
and
allusions
,
which
he
would
not
understand
,
but
on
the
contrary
,
conveyed
the
ring
to
her
in
a
letter
,
written
in
a
counterfeited
character
,
with
a
feigned
name
,
importing
,
that
as
he
had
reason
to
believe
the
token
was
intended
for
another
,
he
could
not
in
conscience
reserve
it
for
his
own
use
:
and
to
crown
her
vexation
,
by
his
contrivance
,
every
circumstance
of
the
story
was
divulged
,
except
the
name
of
the
person
who
had
represented
the
lover
.
    
<EOS>
While
our
adventurer
thus
enjoyed
his
disposition
,
he
was
summoned
to
the
castle
by
an
express
from
his
friend
Hatchway
,
representing
that
the
commodore
lay
at
the
point
of
death
;
and
in
less
than
an
hour
after
the
receipt
of
this
melancholy
piece
of
news
,
he
set
out
post
for
his
uncle
's
habitation
,
having
previously
taken
leave
of
his
associate
Crabtree
,
who
promised
to
meet
him
in
two
months
at
London
,
and
settled
a
correspondence
with
Gauntlet
,
who
proposed
to
remain
at
Bath
during
the
remaining
part
of
the
season
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXIX
   
About
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
our
hero
arrived
at
the
garison
,
where
he
found
his
generous
uncle
in
extremity
,
supported
in
bed
,
by
Julia
on
one
side
,
and
lieutenant
Hatchway
on
the
other
;
while
Mr
Jolter
administered
spiritual
consolation
to
his
soul
,
and
between
whiles
comforted
Mrs
Trunnion
,
who
,
with
her
maid
,
sat
by
the
fire
,
weeping
with
great
decorum
;
the
physician
having
just
taken
his
last
fee
,
and
retired
,
after
pronouncing
the
fatal
prognostic
,
in
which
he
anxiously
wished
he
might
not
be
mistaken
.
    
<EOS>
Though
the
commodore
's
speech
was
interrupted
by
a
violent
hiccup
,
he
still
retained
the
use
of
his
senses
;
and
when
Peregrine
approached
,
stretched
out
his
hand
with
manifest
signs
of
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
whose
heart
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
affection
,
could
not
behold
such
a
spectacle
,
unmoved
.
<EOS>
He
endeavoured
to
conceal
his
tenderness
,
which
in
the
wildness
of
his
youth
,
and
in
the
pride
of
his
disposition
,
he
considered
as
a
derogation
from
his
manhood
;
but
,
in
spite
of
all
his
endeavours
,
the
tears
gushed
from
his
eyes
,
while
he
kissed
the
old
man
's
hand
;
and
he
was
so
utterly
disconcerted
by
his
grief
,
that
when
he
attempted
to
speak
,
his
tongue
denied
its
office
:
so
that
the
commodore
,
perceiving
his
disorder
,
made
a
last
effort
of
strength
,
and
consoled
him
in
these
words
:
<EOS>
"
Swab
the
spray
from
your
bowsprit
,
my
good
lad
,
and
coil
up
your
spirits
.
<EOS>
You
must
not
let
the
top
-
lifts
of
your
heart
give
way
,
because
you
see
me
ready
to
go
down
at
these
years
;
many
a
better
man
has
foundered
before
he
has
made
half
my
way
;
thof
I
trust
,
by
the
mercy
of
God
,
I
shall
be
sure
in
port
in
a
very
few
glasses
,
and
fast
moored
in
a
most
blessed
riding
:
for
my
good
friend
Jolter
hath
overhauled
the
journal
of
my
sins
;
and
by
the
observation
he
hath
taken
of
the
state
of
my
soul
,
I
hope
I
shall
happily
conclude
my
voyage
,
and
be
brought
up
in
the
latitude
of
heaven
.
    
<EOS>
Here
has
been
a
doctor
that
wanted
to
stow
me
chock
-
full
of
physic
;
but
,
when
a
man
's
hour
is
come
,
what
signifies
his
taking
his
departure
with
a
'
pothecary
's
shop
in
his
hold
?
<EOS>
Those
fellows
come
along
side
of
dying
men
,
like
the
messengers
of
the
admiralty
with
sailing
orders
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
told
him
as
how
I
could
slip
my
cable
without
his
direction
or
assistance
,
and
so
he
hauled
off
in
dudgeon
.
<EOS>
This
cursed
hiccup
(
damnation
seize
it
)
makes
such
a
rippling
in
the
current
of
my
speech
,
that
mayhap
you
do
n't
understand
what
I
say
.
<EOS>
Now
,
while
the
sucker
of
my
wind
pump
will
go
,
I
would
willingly
mention
a
few
things
,
which
I
hope
you
will
set
down
in
the
log
-
book
of
your
remembrance
,
when
I
am
stiff
,
d'ye
see
.
<EOS>
There
's
your
aunt
sitting
whimpering
by
the
fire
,
I
desire
you
will
keep
her
tight
,
warm
,
and
easy
in
her
old
age
;
she
's
an
honest
heart
in
her
own
way
,
and
thof
<EOS>
she
goes
a
little
crank
and
humoursome
,
by
being
often
over
-
stowed
with
Nantz
and
religion
,
she
has
been
a
faithful
ship
-
mate
to
me
,
and
I
dare
say
never
turned
in
with
another
man
,
since
we
first
embarked
in
the
same
bottom
.
<EOS>
Jack
Hatchway
,
you
know
the
trim
of
her
as
well
as
e'er
a
man
in
England
,
and
I
believe
she
has
a
kindness
for
you
;
whereby
,
if
you
two
will
grapple
in
the
way
of
matrimony
,
when
I
am
gone
,
I
do
suppose
,
that
my
godson
,
for
love
of
me
,
will
allow
you
to
live
in
the
garison
all
the
days
of
your
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
assured
him
,
he
would
with
pleasure
comply
with
any
request
he
should
make
,
in
behalf
of
two
persons
whom
he
esteemed
so
much
;
and
the
lieutenant
,
with
a
waggish
sneer
,
which
even
the
gravity
of
the
situation
could
not
prevent
,
thanked
them
both
for
their
good
will
,
telling
the
commodore
,
he
was
obliged
to
him
for
his
friendship
,
in
seeking
to
promote
him
to
the
command
of
a
vessel
which
he
himself
had
wore
out
in
the
service
:
that
notwithstanding
,
he
should
be
content
to
take
charge
of
her
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
could
not
help
being
shy
of
coming
after
such
an
able
navigator
.
    
<EOS>
Trunnion
,
exhausted
as
he
was
,
smiled
at
this
sally
,
and
after
some
pause
,
resumed
his
admonitions
in
this
manner
:
"
I
need
not
talk
of
Pipes
,
because
I
know
you
will
do
for
him
,
without
my
recommendation
;
the
fellow
has
sailed
with
me
in
many
a
hard
gale
,
and
I
'll
warrant
him
as
stout
a
seaman
as
ever
set
face
to
the
weather
:
but
I
hope
you
will
take
care
of
the
rest
of
my
crew
,
and
not
disrate
them
after
I
am
dead
,
in
favour
of
new
followers
.
<EOS>
As
for
that
young
woman
,
Ned
Gauntlet
's
daughter
,
I
am
informed
as
how
she
is
an
excellent
wench
,
and
has
a
respect
for
you
;
whereby
,
if
you
run
her
on
board
in
an
unlawful
way
,
I
leave
my
curse
upon
you
,
and
trust
you
will
never
prosper
in
the
voyage
of
life
:
but
,
I
believe
you
are
more
of
an
honest
man
,
than
to
behave
so
much
like
a
pirate
.
<EOS>
I
beg
of
all
love
,
you
wool
take
care
of
your
constitution
,
and
beware
of
running
foul
of
harlots
,
who
are
no
better
than
so
many
mermaids
,
that
sit
upon
rocks
in
the
sea
,
and
hang
out
a
fair
face
for
the
destruction
of
passengers
;
thof
I
must
say
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
never
met
with
any
of
those
sweet
singers
,
and
yet
I
have
gone
to
sea
for
the
space
of
thirty
years
.
<EOS>
But
,
howsomever
,
steer
your
course
clear
of
all
such
brimstone
bitches
;
shun
going
to
law
as
you
would
shun
the
devil
,
and
look
upon
all
attornies
as
devouring
sharks
,
or
ravenous
fish
of
prey
.
    
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
breath
is
out
of
my
body
,
let
minute
guns
be
fired
,
till
I
am
safe
under
ground
:
I
would
also
be
buried
in
the
red
jacket
I
had
on
,
when
I
boarded
and
took
the
Renummy
.
<EOS>
Let
my
pistols
,
cutlass
,
and
pocket
-
compass
be
laid
in
the
coffin
along
with
me
.
<EOS>
Let
me
be
carried
to
the
grave
by
my
own
men
,
dressed
in
the
black
caps
and
white
shirts
which
my
barge
's
crew
were
wo
nt
to
wear
;
and
they
must
keep
a
good
lookout
,
that
none
of
your
pilfering
rapscallions
may
come
and
heave
me
up
again
,
for
the
lucre
of
what
they
can
get
,
until
my
carcase
is
belayed
by
a
tomb
-
stone
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
motto
,
or
what
you
call
it
,
I
leave
that
to
you
and
Mr
Jolter
,
who
are
scholars
;
but
I
do
desire
,
that
it
may
not
be
ingraved
in
the
Greek
or
Latin
lingos
,
and
much
less
in
the
French
,
which
I
abominate
,
but
in
plain
English
,
that
when
the
angel
comes
to
pipe
all
hands
at
the
great
day
,
he
may
know
that
I
am
a
British
man
,
and
speak
to
me
in
my
mother
tongue
.
<EOS>
And
now
I
have
no
more
to
say
,
but
God
in
heaven
have
mercy
upon
my
soul
,
and
send
you
all
fair
weather
,
wheresoever
you
are
bound
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
regarded
every
individual
around
him
with
a
look
of
complacency
,
and
closing
his
eye
,
composed
himself
to
rest
,
while
the
whole
audience
(
Pipes
himself
not
excepted
)
were
melted
with
sorrow
;
and
Mrs
Trunnion
consented
to
quit
the
room
,
that
she
might
not
be
exposed
to
the
unspeakable
anguish
of
seeing
him
expire
.
    
<EOS>
His
last
moments
,
however
,
were
not
so
near
as
they
imagined
;
he
began
to
dose
,
and
enjoyed
small
intervals
of
ease
,
till
next
day
in
the
afternoon
;
during
which
remissions
,
he
was
heard
to
pour
forth
many
pious
ejaculations
,
expressing
his
hope
,
that
,
for
all
the
heavy
cargo
of
his
sins
,
he
should
be
able
to
surmount
the
foothook
-
shrouds
of
despair
,
and
get
aloft
to
the
cross
-
trees
of
God
's
good
favour
.
<EOS>
At
last
,
his
voice
sunk
so
low
,
as
not
to
be
distinguished
;
and
having
lain
about
an
hour
,
almost
without
any
perceptible
signs
of
life
,
he
gave
up
the
ghost
,
with
a
groan
which
anounced
his
decease
.
    
<EOS>
Julia
was
no
sooner
certified
of
this
melancholy
event
,
than
she
ran
to
her
aunt
's
chamber
,
weeping
aloud
;
and
immediately
a
very
decent
concert
was
performed
by
the
good
widow
and
her
attendants
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
and
Hatchway
retired
till
the
corpse
should
be
laid
out
;
and
Pipes
having
surveyed
the
body
,
with
a
face
of
rueful
attention
,
"
Well
fare
thy
soul
!
<EOS>
old
Hawser
Trunnion
,
(
said

)
man
and
boy
<EOS>
I
have
known
thee
these
five
and
thirty
years
,
and
sure
a
truer
heart
never
broke
biscuit
.
<EOS>
Many
a
hard
gale
hast
thou
weathered
;
but
now
thy
spells
are
all
over
,
and
thy
hull
fairly
laid
up
.
<EOS>
A
better
commander
I
'd
never
desire
to
serve
;
and
who
knows
but
I
may
help
to
set
up
thy
standing
rigging
in
another
world
?
"
    
<EOS>
All
the
servants
of
the
house
were
affected
with
the
loss
of
their
old
master
,
and
the
poor
people
in
the
neighbourhood
assembled
at
the
gate
,
and
by
repeated
howlings
expressed
their
sorrow
for
the
death
of
their
charitable
benefactor
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
though
he
felt
every
thing
which
love
and
gratitude
could
inspire
on
this
occasion
,
was
not
so
much
overwhelmed
with
affliction
,
as
to
be
incapable
of
taking
the
management
of
the
family
into
his
own
hands
.
    
<EOS>
He
gave
directions
about
the
funeral
with
great
discretion
,
after
having
paid
the
compliments
of
condolance
to
his
aunt
,
whom
he
consoled
with
the
assurance
of
his
inviolable
esteem
and
affection
.
<EOS>
He
ordered
suits
of
mourning
to
be
made
for
every
person
in
the
garison
,
and
invited
all
the
neighbouring
gentlemen
to
the
burial
,
not
even
excepting
his
father
and
brother
Gam
,
who
did
not
,
however
,
honour
the
ceremony
with
their
presence
;
nor
was
his
mother
humane
enough
to
visit
her
sister
-
in
-
law
in
her
distress
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
method
of
interment
,
the
commodore
's
injunctions
were
obeyed
to
a
tittle
;
and
at
the
same
time
our
hero
made
a
donation
of
fifty
pounds
to
the
poor
of
the
parish
,
as
a
benefaction
which
his
uncle
had
forgot
to
bequeath
.
    
<EOS>
Having
performed
these
obsequies
with
the
most
pious
punctuality
,
he
examined
the
will
,
to
which
there
was
no
addition
since
it
had
been
first
executed
,
adjusted
the
payment
of
all
the
legacies
,
and
being
sole
executor
,
took
an
account
of
the
estate
to
which
he
had
succeeded
,
and
which
,
after
all
deductions
,
amounted
to
thirty
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
possession
of
such
a
fortune
,
of
which
he
was
absolute
master
,
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
humiliation
of
his
spirit
,
but
inspired
him
with
new
ideas
of
grandeur
and
magnificence
,
and
elevated
his
hope
to
the
highest
pinnacle
of
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
His
domestic
affairs
being
settled
,
he
was
visited
by
almost
all
the
gentlemen
of
the
county
,
who
came
to
pay
their
compliments
of
congratulation
,
on
his
accession
to
the
estate
;
and
some
of
them
offered
their
good
offices
towards
a
reconciliation
betwixt
his
father
and
him
,
induced
by
the
general
detestation
which
was
entertained
for
<EOS>
his
brother
Gam
,
who
was
by
this
time
looked
upon
by
his
neighbours
as
a
prodigy
of
insolence
and
malice
.
<EOS>
Our
young
squire
thanked
them
for
their
kind
proposal
,
which
he
accepted
;
and
old
Gamaliel
,
at
their
intreaties
,
seemed
very
well
disposed
to
an
accommodation
:
but
,
as
he
would
not
venture
to
declare
himself
,
before
he
had
consulted
his
wife
,
that
favourable
disposition
was
rendered
altogether
ineffectual
,
by
the
instigations
of
that
implacable
woman
;
and
our
hero
resigned
all
expectation
of
being
reunited
to
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
His
brother
,
as
usual
,
took
all
opportunities
of
injuring
his
character
,
by
false
aspersions
and
stories
misrepresented
,
in
order
to
prejudice
his
reputation
:
nor
was
his
sister
Julia
suffered
to
enjoy
her
good
fortune
in
peace
.
<EOS>
Had
he
undergone
such
persecution
from
an
alien
to
his
blood
,
the
world
would
have
heard
of
his
revenge
;
but
,
notwithstanding
his
indignation
,
he
was
too
much
tinctured
by
the
prejudices
of
consanguinity
,
to
lift
his
arm
in
judgment
against
the
son
of
his
own
parents
;
and
this
consideration
abridged
the
term
of
his
residence
at
the
garison
,
where
he
had
proposed
to
stay
for
some
months
.

Chapter
LXXX
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
having
settled
his
domestic
affairs
,
arrives
in
London
,
and
sets
up
a
gay
equipage
.
<EOS>
He
meets
with
Emilia
,
and
is
introduced
to
her
uncle
.
   
<EOS>
His
aunt
,
at
the
earnest
solicitation
of
Julia
and
her
husband
,
took
up
her
quarters
at
the
house
of
that
affectionate
kinswoman
,
who
made
it
her
chief
study
to
comfort
and
cherish
the
disconsolate
widow
;
and
Jolter
,
in
expectation
of
the
living
,
which
was
not
yet
vacant
,
remained
in
garison
,
in
quality
of
land
-
steward
upon
our
hero
's
country
-
estate
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
lieutenant
,
our
young
gentleman
communed
with
him
,
in
a
serious
manner
,
about
the
commodore
's
proposal
of
his
taking
Mrs
Trunnion
to
wife
;
and
Jack
,
being
quite
tired
of
the
solitary
situation
of
a
batchelor
,
which
nothing
but
the
company
of
his
old
commander
could
have
enabled
him
to
support
so
long
,
far
from
discovering
aversion
to
the
match
,
observed
with
an
arch
smile
,
that
it
was
not
the
first
time
he
had
commanded
a
vessel
in
the
absence
of
Captain
Trunnion
;
and
therefore
,
if
the
widow
was
willing
,
he
would
chearfully
stand
by
her
helm
,
and
,
as
he
hoped
the
duty
would
not
be
of
long
continuance
,
do
his
endeavour
to
steer
her
safe
into
the
port
,
where
the
commodore
might
come
on
board
,
and
take
charge
of
her
again
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
declaration
,
it
was
determined
that
Mr
Hatchway
should
make
his
addresses
to
Mrs
Trunnion
,
as
soon
as
decency
would
permit
her
to
receive
them
;
and
Mr
Clover
and
his
wife
promised
to
exert
their
influence
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
Mean
while
,
Jack
was
desired
to
live
at
the
castle
as
usual
,
and
assured
,
that
it
should
be
put
wholly
in
his
possession
,
as
soon
as
he
should
be
able
to
accomplish
this
matrimonial
scheme
.
    
<EOS>
When
Peregrine
had
settled
all
these
points
to
his
own
satisfaction
,
he
took
leave
of
all
his
friends
,
and
repairing
to
the
great
city
,
purchased
a
new
chariot
and
horses
,
put
Pipes
and
another
lacquey
into
rich
liveries
,
took
elegant
lodgings
in
Pall
-
mall
,
and
made
a
most
remarkable
appearance
among
people
of
fashion
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
owing
to
this
equipage
,
and
the
gaiety
of
his
personal
deportment
,
that
common
fame
,
which
is
always
a
common
liar
,
represented
him
as
a
young
gentleman
who
had
just
succeeded
to
an
estate
of
five
thousand
pounds
per
annum
,
by
the
death
of
an
uncle
;
that
he
was
intitled
to
an
equal
fortune
at
the
decease
of
his
own
father
,
exclusive
of
two
considerable
jointures
,
which
would
devolve
upon
him
,
at
the
demise
of
his
mother
and
aunt
.
<EOS>
This
report
(
false
and
ridiculous
as
it
was
)
he
could
not
find
in
his
heart
to
contradict
;
not
but
that
he
was
sorry
to
find
himself
so
misrepresented
:
but
his
vanity
would
not
allow
him
to
take
any
step
that
might
diminish
his
importance
in
the
opinion
of
those
who
courted
his
acquaintance
,
on
the
supposition
that
his
circumstances
were
actually
as
affluent
as
they
were
said
to
be
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
much
was
he
infatuated
by
this
weakness
,
that
he
resolved
to
encourage
the
deception
,
by
living
up
to
the
report
;
and
accordingly
,
engaged
in
the
most
expensive
parties
of
pleasure
;
believing
,
that
before
his
present
finances
should
be
exhausted
,
his
fortune
would
be
effectually
made
,
by
the
personal
accomplishments
he
should
have
occasion
to
display
to
the
beau
monde
,
in
the
course
of
his
extravagance
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
vanity
and
pride
were
the
ruling
foibles
of
our
adventurer
,
who
imagined
himself
sufficiently
qualified
to
retrieve
his
fortune
in
various
shapes
,
long
before
he
could
have
any
idea
of
want
or
difficulty
.
    
<EOS>
He
thought
he
should
have
it
in
his
power
,
at
any
time
,
to
make
prize
of
a
rich
heiress
,
or
opulent
widow
;
his
ambition
had
already
aspired
to
the
heart
of
a
young
handsome
duchess
dowager
,
to
whose
acquaintance
he
had
found
means
to
be
introduced
:
or
,
should
matrimony
chance
to
be
unsuitable
to
his
inclinations
,
he
never
doubted
,
that
by
the
interest
he
might
acquire
among
the
nobility
,
he
should
be
favoured
with
some
lucrative
post
,
that
would
amply
recompense
him
for
the
liberality
of
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
There
are
many
young
men
,
who
entertain
the
same
expectations
,
with
half
the
reason
he
had
to
be
so
presumptuous
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
chimerical
calculations
,
his
passion
for
Emilia
did
not
subside
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
began
to
rage
to
such
an
inflammation
of
desire
,
that
her
idea
interfered
with
every
other
reflection
,
and
absolutely
disabled
him
from
prosecuting
the
other
lofty
schemes
which
his
imagination
had
projected
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
laid
down
the
honest
resolution
of
visiting
her
in
all
the
splendor
of
his
situation
,
in
order
to
practise
upon
her
virtue
with
all
his
art
and
address
,
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
influence
and
fortune
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
effectually
had
his
guilty
passion
<EOS>
absorb'd
<EOS>
his
principles
of
honour
,
conscience
,
humanity
,
and
regard
for
the
commodore
's
last
words
,
that
he
was
base
enough
to
rejoice
at
the
absence
of
his
friend
Godfrey
,
who
being
then
with
his
regiment
in
Ireland
,
could
not
dive
into
his
purpose
,
or
take
measures
for
frustrating
his
vicious
design
.
    
<EOS>
Fraught
with
these
heroic
sentiments
,
he
determined
to
set
out
for
Sussex
in
his
chariot
and
six
,
attended
by
his
valet
de
chambre
and
two
footmen
;
and
as
he
was
now
sensible
,
that
in
his
last
essay
he
had
mistaken
his
cue
,
he
determined
to
change
his
battery
,
and
sap
the
fortress
,
by
the
most
submissive
,
soft
,
and
insinuating
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
evening
that
preceded
this
purposed
expedition
,
he
went
into
one
of
the
boxes
at
the
play
-
house
,
as
usual
,
to
shew
himself
to
the
ladies
;
and
in
reconnoitring
the
company
through
a
glass
,
(
for
no
other
reason
,
but
because
it
was
fashionable
to
be
purblind
)
perceived
his
mistress
very
plainly
dressed
,
in
one
of
the
seats
above
the
stage
,
talking
to
another
young
woman
of
a
very
homely
appearance
.
<EOS>
Though
his
heart
beat
the
alarm
with
the
utmost
impatience
at
sight
of
his
Emilia
,
he
was
for
some
minutes
deterred
from
obeying
the
impulse
of
his
love
,
by
the
presence
of
some
ladies
of
fashion
,
who
,
he
feared
,
would
think
the
worse
of
him
,
should
they
see
him
make
his
compliments
in
public
to
a
person
of
her
figure
.
<EOS>
Nor
would
the
violence
of
his
inclination
have
so
far
prevailed
over
his
pride
,
as
to
lead
him
thither
,
had
not
he
recollected
,
that
his
quality
-
friends
would
look
upon
her
as
some
handsome
Abigail
,
with
whom
he
had
an
affair
of
gallantry
,
and
of
consequence
gave
him
credit
for
the
intrigue
.
    
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
suggestion
,
he
complied
with
the
dictates
of
love
,
and
flew
to
the
place
where
his
charmer
sat
.
<EOS>
His
air
and
dress
were
so
remarkable
,
that
it
was
almost
impossible
he
should
have
escaped
the
eyes
of
a
curious
observer
,
especially
as
he
had
chosen
a
time
for
coming
in
,
when
his
entrance
could
not
fail
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
spectators
;
I
mean
,
when
the
whole
house
was
hushed
in
attention
to
the
performance
on
the
stage
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
therefore
,
had
perceived
him
at
his
first
approach
;
she
found
herself
discovered
by
the
direction
of
his
glass
,
and
guessing
his
intention
by
his
abrupt
retreat
from
the
box
,
summoned
all
her
fortitude
to
her
aid
,
and
prepared
for
his
reception
.
<EOS>
He
advanced
to
her
with
an
air
of
eagerness
and
joy
,
tempered
with
modesty
and
respect
,
and
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
seeing
her
,
with
a
seeming
reverence
of
regard
.
<EOS>
Though
she
was
extremely
well
pleased
at
this
unexpected
behaviour
,
she
suppressed
the
emotions
of
her
heart
,
and
answered
his
compliments
with
affected
ease
and
unconcern
,
such
as
might
denote
the
good
humour
of
a
person
who
meets
by
accident
with
an
indifferent
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
After
having
certified
himself
of
her
own
good
health
,
he
very
kindly
inquired
about
her
mother
and
Miss
Sophy
,
gave
her
to
understand
,
that
he
had
lately
been
favoured
with
a
letter
from
Godfrey
,
and
that
he
had
actually
intended
to
set
out
next
morning
on
a
visit
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
which
(
now
that
he
was
so
happy
as
to
meet
with
her
)
he
would
postpone
,
until
he
should
have
the
pleasure
of
attending
her
to
the
country
.
<EOS>
After
having
thanked
him
for
his
polite
intention
,
she
told
him
,
that
her
mother
was
expected
in
town
in
a
few
days
,
and
that
she
herself
had
come
to
London
some
weeks
ago
,
to
give
her
attendance
upon
her
aunt
,
who
had
been
dangerously
ill
,
but
was
now
pretty
well
recovered
.
    
<EOS>
Although
the
conversation
of
course
turned
upon
general
topics
,
during
the
entertainment
,
he
took
all
opportunities
of
being
particular
with
his
eyes
,
through
which
he
conveyed
a
thousand
tender
protestations
.
<EOS>
She
saw
,
and
inwardly
rejoiced
at
the
humility
of
his
looks
;
but
,
far
from
rewarding
it
with
one
approving
glance
,
she
industriously
avoided
this
ocular
intercourse
,
and
rather
coquetted
with
a
young
gentleman
that
ogled
her
from
the
opposite
box
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
penetration
easily
detected
her
sentiments
,
and
he
was
nettled
at
her
dissimulation
,
which
served
to
confirm
him
in
his
unwarrantable
designs
upon
her
person
.
<EOS>
He
persisted
in
his
assiduities
with
indefatigable
perseverance
;
when
the
play
was
concluded
,
handed
her
and
her
companion
to
an
hackney
-
coach
,
and
with
difficulty
was
permitted
to
escort
them
to
the
house
of
Emilia
's
uncle
,
to
whom
our
hero
was
introduced
by
the
young
lady
,
as
an
intimate
friend
of
her
brother
Godfrey
.
    
<EOS>
The
old
gentleman
,
who
was
no
stranger
to
the
nature
of
Peregrine
's
connexion
with
his
sister
's
family
,
prevailed
upon
him
to
stay
supper
,
and
seemed
particularly
well
pleased
with
his
conversation
and
deportment
,
which
,
by
help
of
his
natural
sagacity
,
he
wonderfully
adapted
to
the
humour
of
his
entertainer
.
<EOS>
After
supper
,
when
the
ladies
were
withdrawn
,
and
the
citizen
called
for
his
pipe
,
our
sly
adventurer
followed
his
example
;
and
though
he
abhorred
the
plant
,
smoaked
with
an
air
of
infinite
satisfaction
,
and
expatiated
upon
the
virtues
of
tobacco
,
as
if
he
had
been
deeply
concerned
in
the
Virginia
trade
.
<EOS>
In
the
progress
of
the
discourse
,
he
consulted
the
merchant
's
disposition
;
and
the
national
debt
coming
upon
the
carpet
,
held
forth
upon
the
funds
like
a
professed
broker
.
    
<EOS>
When
the
alderman
complained
of
the
restrictions
and
discouragement
of
trade
,
his
guest
inveighed
against
exorbitant
duties
,
with
the
nature
of
which
he
seemed
as
well
acquainted
as
any
commissioner
of
the
customs
;
so
that
the
uncle
was
astonished
at
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
,
and
expressed
his
surprize
,
that
a
gay
young
gentleman
,
like
him
,
should
have
found
either
leisure
or
inclination
to
consider
subjects
so
foreign
to
the
fashionable
amusements
of
youth
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
laid
hold
on
this
opportunity
to
tell
him
,
that
he
was
descended
from
a
race
of
merchants
;
and
that
,
early
in
life
,
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
instruct
himself
in
the
different
branches
of
trade
,
which
he
not
only
studied
as
his
family
-
profession
,
but
also
as
the
source
of
all
our
national
riches
and
power
.
<EOS>
He
then
launched
out
in
praise
of
commerce
,
and
the
promoters
thereof
;
and
,
by
way
of
contrast
,
employed
all
his
ridicule
,
in
drawing
such
ludicrous
pictures
of
the
manners
and
education
of
what
is
called
high
life
,
that
the
trader
's
sides
were
shaken
by
laughter
,
even
to
the
danger
of
his
life
;
and
he
looked
upon
our
adventurer
as
a
miracle
of
sobriety
and
good
sense
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
ingratiated
himself
with
the
uncle
,
Peregrine
took
his
leave
,
and
next
day
in
the
forenoon
visited
the
niece
in
his
chariot
,
after
she
had
been
admonished
by
her
kinsman
to
behave
with
circumspection
,
and
cautioned
against
neglecting
or
discouraging
the
addresses
of
such
a
valuable
admirer
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXXI
<EOS>
He
prosecutes
his
design
upon
Emilia
with
great
art
and
perseverance
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
having
by
his
hypocrisy
obtained
free
access
to
his
mistress
,
began
the
siege
,
by
professing
the
most
sincere
contrition
for
his
former
levity
,
and
imploring
her
forgiveness
with
such
earnest
supplication
,
that
,
guarded
as
she
was
against
his
flattering
arts
<EOS>
,
she
began
to
believe
his
protestations
,
which
were
even
accompanied
with
tears
,
and
abated
a
good
deal
of
that
severity
and
distance
she
had
proposed
to
maintain
,
during
this
interview
.
<EOS>
She
would
not
,
however
,
favour
him
with
the
least
acknowledgment
of
a
mutual
passion
,
because
,
in
the
midst
of
his
vows
of
eternal
constancy
and
truth
,
he
did
not
mention
one
syllable
of
wedlock
,
though
he
was
now
intirely
master
of
his
own
conduct
;
and
this
consideration
created
a
doubt
,
which
fortified
her
against
all
his
attacks
:
yet
,
what
her
discretion
would
have
concealed
,
was
discovered
by
her
eyes
,
which
,
in
spite
of
all
her
endeavours
,
breathed
forth
complacency
and
love
.
<EOS>
For
,
her
inclination
was
flattered
by
her
own
self
-
sufficiency
,
which
imputed
her
admirer
's
silence
,
in
that
particular
,
to
the
hurry
and
perturbation
of
his
spirits
,
and
persuaded
her
,
that
he
could
not
possibly
regard
her
with
any
other
than
honourable
intentions
.
    
<EOS>
The
insidious
lover
exulted
in
the
tenderness
of
her
looks
,
from
which
he
presaged
a
compleat
victory
:
but
,
that
he
might
not
over
-
shoot
himself
by
his
own
precipitation
,
he
would
not
run
the
risk
of
declaring
himself
,
until
her
heart
should
be
so
far
entangled
within
his
snares
,
as
that
neither
the
suggestions
of
honour
,
prudence
,
or
pride
should
be
able
to
disengage
it
.
    
<EOS>
Armed
with
this
resolution
,
he
restrained
the
impatience
of
his
temper
within
the
limits
of
the
most
delicate
deportment
;
and
after
having
solicited
and
obtained
permission
to
attend
her
to
the
next
opera
,
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
in
the
most
respectful
manner
,
went
away
,
leaving
her
in
a
most
whimsical
state
of
suspence
,
checquered
with
an
interesting
vicissitude
of
hope
and
fear
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
appointed
day
,
he
appeared
again
about
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
and
found
her
native
charms
so
much
improved
by
the
advantages
of
dress
,
that
he
was
transported
with
admiration
and
delight
;
and
while
he
conducted
her
to
the
Hay
-
market
,
could
scarce
bridle
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
so
as
to
observe
the
forbearing
maxims
he
had
adopted
.
<EOS>
When
she
entered
the
pit
,
he
had
abundance
of
food
for
the
gratification
of
his
vanity
;
for
,
in
a
moment
,
she
eclipsed
all
the
female
part
of
the
audience
,
each
individual
allowing
in
her
own
heart
,
that
the
stranger
was
by
far
the
handsomest
woman
there
present
,
except
herself
.
    
<EOS>
Here
it
was
that
our
hero
enjoyed
a
double
triumph
;
he
was
vain
of
this
opportunity
to
enhance
his
reputation
for
gallantry
among
the
ladies
of
fashion
,
who
knew
him
,
and
proud
of
an
occasion
to
display
his
quality
-
acquaintance
to
Emilia
,
that
she
might
entertain
the
greater
idea
of
the
conquest
she
had
made
,
and
pay
the
more
deference
to
his
importance
in
the
sequel
of
his
addresses
.
<EOS>
That
he
might
profit
as
much
as
possible
by
this
situation
,
he
went
up
and
accosted
every
person
in
the
pit
,
with
whom
he
ever
had
the
least
communication
,
whispered
and
laughed
with
an
affected
air
of
familiarity
,
and
even
bowed
at
a
distance
to
some
of
the
nobility
,
on
the
slender
foundation
of
having
stood
near
them
at
court
,
or
presented
them
with
a
pinch
of
Rappee
at
White
's
chocolate
-
house
.
    
<EOS>
This
ridiculous
ostentation
,
though
now
practised
with
a
view
of
promoting
his
design
,
was
a
weakness
that
,
in
some
degree
,
infected
the
whole
of
his
behaviour
;
for
nothing
gave
him
so
much
joy
in
conversation
,
as
an
opportunity
of
giving
the
company
to
understand
,
how
well
he
was
with
persons
of
distinguished
rank
and
character
:
he
would
often
(
for
example
)
observe
,
as
it
were
occasionally
,
that
the
duke
of
G
#
#
#
#
was
one
of
the
best
natured
men
in
the
world
,
and
illustrate
his
assertion
by
some
instance
of
his
affability
,
<EOS>
in
which
he
himself
was
concerned
:
then
,
by
an
abrupt
transition
,
he
would
repeat
some
repartee
of
lady
T
#
#
#
#
,
and
mention
a
certain
bon
mot
of
the
earl
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
which
was
uttered
in
his
hearing
.
    
<EOS>
Abundance
of
young
men
,
in
this
manner
,
make
free
with
the
names
,
though
they
have
never
had
access
to
the
persons
of
the
nobility
:
<EOS>
but
,
this
was
not
the
case
with
Peregrine
,
who
,
in
consideration
of
his
appearance
and
supposed
fortune
,
together
with
the
advantage
of
his
introduction
,
was
by
this
time
freely
admitted
to
the
tables
of
the
great
.
    
<EOS>
In
his
return
with
Emilia
from
the
opera
,
though
he
still
maintained
the
most
scrupulous
decorum
in
his
behaviour
,
he
plied
her
with
the
most
passionate
expressions
of
love
,
squeezed
her
hand
with
great
fervency
,
protested
that
his
whole
soul
was
ingrossed
by
her
idea
,
and
that
he
could
not
exist
independent
of
her
favour
.
<EOS>
Pleased
as
she
was
with
his
warm
and
pathetic
addresses
,
together
with
the
respectful
manner
of
his
making
love
,
she
yet
had
prudence
and
resolution
sufficient
to
contain
her
tenderness
,
which
was
ready
to
run
over
;
being
fortified
against
his
arts
,
by
reflecting
,
that
if
his
aim
was
honourable
,
it
was
now
his
business
to
declare
it
.
    
<EOS>
On
this
consideration
,
she
refused
to
make
any
serious
reply
to
his
earnest
expostulations
,
but
affected
to
receive
them
as
the
undetermined
effusions
of
gallantry
and
good
breeding
.
    
<EOS>
This
fictitious
gaiety
and
good
humour
,
though
it
baffled
his
hope
of
extorting
from
her
an
acknowledgment
of
which
he
might
have
taken
immediate
advantage
,
nevertheless
encouraged
him
to
observe
,
(
as
the
chariot
passed
along
the
Strand
)
that
the
night
was
far
advanced
;
that
supper
would
certainly
be
over
,
before
they
could
reach
her
uncle
's
house
;
and
to
propose
,
that
he
should
wait
upon
her
to
some
place
,
where
they
might
be
accommodated
with
a
slight
refreshment
.
<EOS>
She
was
offended
at
the
freedom
of
this
proposal
,
which
,
however
,
she
treated
as
a
joke
,
thanking
him
for
his
courteous
offer
,
and
assuring
him
,
that
when
she
should
be
disposed
for
a
tavern
-
treat
,
he
alone
should
have
the
opportunity
of
bestowing
it
.
    
<EOS>
Her
kinsman
being
engaged
with
company
abroad
,
and
her
aunt
retired
to
rest
,
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
enjoy
a
tte
a
tte
with
her
during
a
whole
hour
,
which
he
employed
with
such
consummate
skill
,
that
her
caution
was
almost
overcome
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
assailed
her
with
the
artillery
of
sighs
,
vows
,
prayers
and
tears
,
but
even
pawned
his
honour
in
behalf
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
He
swore
with
many
imprecations
,
that
although
her
heart
were
surrendered
to
him
at
discretion
,
there
was
a
principle
within
him
,
which
would
never
allow
him
to
injure
such
innocence
and
beauty
;
and
the
transports
of
his
passion
had
,
upon
this
occasion
,
so
far
overshot
his
purpose
,
that
if
she
had
demanded
an
explanation
,
while
he
was
thus
agitated
,
he
would
have
engaged
himself
to
her
wish
by
such
ties
,
as
he
could
not
possibly
break
,
with
any
regard
to
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
But
,
from
such
expostulation
,
she
was
deterred
partly
by
pride
,
and
partly
by
the
dread
of
finding
herself
mistaken
in
such
an
interesting
conjecture
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
enjoyed
the
present
flattering
appearance
of
her
fate
,
was
prevailed
upon
to
accept
the
jewels
which
he
had
purchased
with
part
of
his
winning
at
Bath
,
and
with
the
most
inchanting
condescension
submitted
to
a
warm
embrace
,
when
he
took
his
leave
,
after
having
obtained
permission
to
visit
her
,
as
often
as
his
inclination
and
convenience
would
permit
.
    
<EOS>
In
his
return
to
his
own
lodgings
,
he
was
buoyed
up
with
his
success
to
an
extravagance
of
hope
,
already
congratulated
himself
upon
his
triumph
over
Emilia
's
virtue
,
and
began
to
project
future
conquests
among
the
most
dignified
characters
of
the
female
sex
.
<EOS>
But
his
attention
was
not
at
all
dissipated
by
these
vain
reflections
;
he
resolved
to
concentrate
the
whole
exertion
of
his
soul
upon
the
execution
of
his
present
plan
,
desisted
,
in
the
mean
time
,
from
all
other
schemes
of
pleasure
,
interest
and
ambition
,
and
took
lodgings
in
the
city
,
for
the
more
commodious
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
While
our
lover
's
imagination
was
thus
agreeably
regaled
,
his
mistress
did
not
enjoy
her
expectations
,
without
the
intervention
of
doubts
and
anxiety
.
<EOS>
His
silence
touching
the
final
aim
of
his
addresses
was
a
mystery
on
which
she
was
afraid
of
exercising
her
sagacity
;
and
her
uncle
tormented
her
with
inquiries
into
the
circumstances
of
Peregrine
's
professions
and
deportment
.
    
<EOS>
Rather
than
give
this
relation
the
least
cause
of
suspicion
,
which
must
have
cut
off
all
intercourse
betwixt
her
and
her
admirer
,
she
said
every
thing
which
she
thought
would
satisfy
his
care
and
concern
for
her
welfare
;
and
in
consequence
of
such
representation
,
she
enjoyed
,
without
reserve
,
the
company
of
our
adventurer
,
who
prosecuted
his
plan
with
surprising
eagerness
and
perseverance
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXXII
He
prevails
upon
Emilia
to
accompany
him
to
a
masquerade
,
makes
a
treacherous
attempt
upon
her
affection
,
and
meets
with
a
deserved
repulse
.
   
<EOS>
Scarce
a
night
elapsed
in
which
he
did
not
conduct
her
to
some
public
entertainment
;
and
when
,
by
dint
of
his
insidious
carriage
,
he
thought
himself
in
full
possession
of
her
confidence
and
affection
,
he
lay
in
wait
for
an
opportunity
;
and
hearing
her
observe
in
conversation
,
that
she
had
never
been
at
a
masquerade
,
begged
leave
to
attend
her
to
the
next
ball
;
at
the
same
time
,
extending
his
invitation
to
the
young
lady
,
in
whose
company
he
had
found
her
at
the
play
,
she
being
present
when
this
subject
of
discourse
was
introduced
.
<EOS>
He
had
flattered
himself
,
that
this
gentlewoman
would
decline
the
proposal
,
as
she
was
a
person
seemingly
of
a
demure
disposition
,
who
had
been
born
and
bred
in
the
city
,
where
such
diversions
are
looked
upon
as
scenes
of
lewdness
and
debauchery
.
<EOS>
For
once
,
however
,
he
reckoned
without
his
host
;
curiosity
is
as
prevalent
in
the
city
as
at
the
court
-
end
of
the
town
:
    
Emilia
no
sooner
signified
her
assent
to
his
proposal
,
than
her
friend
,
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
,
agreed
to
make
one
of
the
partie
;
and
he
was
obliged
to
thank
her
for
that
complaisance
which
laid
him
under
infinite
mortification
.
<EOS>
He
set
his
genius
at
work
,
to
invent
some
scheme
for
preventing
her
unseasonable
intrusion
.
<EOS>
Had
an
opportunity
offered
,
he
would
have
acted
as
her
physician
,
and
administered
a
medicine
that
would
have
laid
her
under
the
necessity
of
staying
at
home
:
but
his
acquaintance
with
her
being
too
slight
to
furnish
him
with
the
means
of
executing
this
expedient
,
he
devised
another
,
which
was
practised
with
all
imaginable
success
.
<EOS>
Understanding
that
her
grandmother
had
left
her
a
sum
of
money
independent
of
her
parents
,
he
conveyed
a
letter
to
her
mother
,
intimating
,
that
her
daughter
,
on
pretence
of
going
to
the
masquerade
,
intended
to
bestow
herself
in
marriage
to
a
certain
person
,
and
that
in
a
few
days
she
would
be
informed
of
the
circumstances
of
the
whole
intrigue
,
provided
she
would
keep
this
information
secret
,
and
contrive
some
excuse
for
detaining
the
young
lady
at
home
,
without
giving
her
cause
to
believe
she
was
apprized
of
her
intention
.
<EOS>
This
billet
,
subscribed
,
Your
well
-
wisher
and
unknown
humble
servant
,
had
the
desired
effect
upon
the
careful
matron
,
who
,
on
the
ball
-
day
,
feigned
herself
so
extremely
ill
,
that
miss
could
not
,
with
any
decency
,
quit
her
mamma
's
apartment
;
and
therefore
sent
her
apology
to
Emilia
in
the
afternoon
,
immediately
after
the
arrival
of
Peregrine
,
who
pretended
to
be
very
much
afflicted
with
the
disappointment
,
while
his
heart
throbbed
with
a
transport
of
joy
.
    
<EOS>
About
ten
o'clock
the
lovers
set
out
for
the
Hay
-
market
,
he
being
dressed
in
the
habit
of
Pantaloon
,
and
she
in
that
of
Columbine
;
and
they
had
scarce
entered
the
house
,
when
the
music
struck
up
,
the
curtain
was
withdrawn
,
and
the
whole
scene
displayed
at
once
,
to
the
admiration
of
Emilia
,
whose
expectation
was
infinitely
surpassed
by
this
exhibition
.
<EOS>
Our
gallant
having
conducted
her
through
all
the
different
apartments
,
and
described
the
oeconomy
of
the
place
,
led
her
into
the
circle
,
and
,
in
their
turn
,
they
danced
several
minuets
;
then
going
to
the
sideboard
,
he
prevailed
upon
her
to
eat
some
sweetmeets
and
drink
a
glass
of
Champagne
;
and
,
after
a
second
review
of
the
company
,
they
engaged
in
country
-
dances
,
at
which
exercise
they
continued
,
until
our
adventurer
concluded
,
that
his
partner
's
blood
was
sufficiently
warmed
for
the
prosecution
of
his
design
.
<EOS>
On
this
supposition
,
which
was
built
upon
her
declaring
,
that
she
was
thirsty
and
fatigued
,
he
persuaded
her
to
take
a
little
refreshment
and
repose
;
and
for
that
purpose
,
handed
her
down
stairs
into
the
eating
-
room
,
where
having
seated
her
on
the
floor
,
he
presented
her
with
a
glass
of
wine
and
water
;
and
as
she
complained
of
being
faint
,
enriched
the
draught
with
some
drops
of
a
certain
elixir
,
which
he
recommended
as
a
most
excellent
restorative
,
though
it
was
no
other
than
a
stimulating
tincture
,
which
he
had
treacherously
provided
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
Having
swallowed
this
potion
,
by
which
her
spirits
were
manifestly
exhilerated
,
she
ate
a
slice
of
ham
with
the
wing
of
a
cold
pullet
,
and
concluded
the
meal
with
a
glass
of
Burgundy
,
which
she
drank
at
the
earnest
intreaty
of
her
admirer
.
<EOS>
These
extraordinary
cordials
co
-
operating
with
the
ferment
of
her
blood
,
which
was
heated
by
violent
motion
,
could
not
fail
to
affect
the
constitution
of
a
delicate
young
creature
,
who
was
naturally
sprightly
and
volatile
.
    
<EOS>
Her
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
unusual
usual
fire
and
vivacity
,
a
thousand
brilliant
sallies
of
wit
escaped
her
,
and
every
mask
that
accosted
her
,
underwent
some
smarting
repartee
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
overjoyed
at
the
success
of
his
administration
,
proposed
that
they
should
resume
their
places
at
the
country
-
dances
,
with
a
view
to
promote
and
assist
the
efficacy
of
his
elixir
;
and
when
he
thought
her
disposition
was
properly
adapted
for
the
theme
,
began
to
ply
her
with
all
the
elocution
of
love
.
<EOS>
In
order
to
elevate
his
own
spirits
to
that
pitch
of
resolution
which
his
scheme
required
,
he
drank
two
whole
bottles
of
Burgundy
,
which
inflamed
his
passion
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
found
himself
capable
of
undertaking
and
perpetrating
any
scheme
for
the
gratification
of
his
desire
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
warmed
by
so
many
concurring
incentives
,
in
favour
of
the
man
she
loved
,
abated
considerably
of
her
wonted
reserve
,
listened
to
his
protestations
with
undissembled
pleasure
,
and
in
the
confidence
of
her
satisfaction
,
even
owned
him
absolute
master
of
her
affections
.
<EOS>
Ravished
with
this
confession
,
he
now
deemed
himself
on
the
brink
of
reaping
the
delicious
fruits
of
his
art
and
assiduity
;
and
the
morning
being
already
pretty
far
advanced
,
assented
with
rapture
to
the
first
proposal
she
made
of
retiring
to
her
lodgings
.
<EOS>
The
blinds
of
the
chariot
being
pulled
up
,
he
took
advantage
of
the
favourable
situation
of
her
thoughts
;
and
on
pretence
of
being
whimsical
,
in
consequence
of
the
wine
he
had
swallowed
,
clasped
her
in
his
arms
,
and
imprinted
a
thousand
kisses
on
her
pouting
lips
,
a
freedom
which
she
pardoned
as
the
privilege
of
intoxication
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
indulged
himself
with
impunity
,
the
carriage
halted
,
and
Pipes
opening
the
door
,
his
master
handed
her
into
the
passage
,
before
she
perceived
that
it
was
not
her
uncle
's
house
,
at
which
they
had
alighted
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
this
discovery
,
she
with
some
confusion
desired
to
know
his
reason
for
conducting
her
to
a
strange
place
at
these
hours
:
but
he
made
no
reply
,
until
he
had
led
her
into
an
apartment
,
when
he
gave
her
to
understand
,
that
as
her
uncle
's
family
must
be
disturbed
by
her
going
thither
so
late
in
the
night
,
and
the
streets
near
Temple
-
bar
were
infested
by
a
multitude
of
robbers
and
cut
-
throats
,
he
had
ordered
his
coachman
to
halt
at
this
house
,
which
was
kept
by
a
relation
of
his
,
a
mighty
good
sort
of
a
gentlewoman
,
who
was
proud
of
an
opportunity
to
accommodate
a
person
for
whom
he
was
known
to
entertain
such
tenderness
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
had
too
much
penetration
to
be
imposed
upon
by
this
plausible
pretext
:
in
spite
of
her
partiality
for
Peregrine
,
which
had
never
been
inflamed
to
such
a
pitch
of
complacency
before
,
she
comprehended
his
whole
plan
in
a
twinkling
;
and
though
her
blood
boiled
with
indignation
,
thanked
him
,
with
an
affected
air
of
serenity
,
for
his
kind
concern
,
and
expressed
her
obligation
to
his
cousin
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
insisted
upon
going
home
,
lest
her
absence
should
terrify
her
uncle
and
aunt
,
who
she
knew
would
not
retire
to
rest
,
till
her
return
.
    
<EOS>
He
urged
her
,
with
a
thousand
remonstrances
,
to
consult
her
own
ease
and
safety
,
promising
to
send
Pipes
into
the
city
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
her
relations
:
but
finding
her
obstinately
deaf
to
his
intreaties
,
he
assured
her
,
that
he
would
in
a
few
minutes
comply
with
her
request
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
begg'd
she
would
fortify
herself
against
the
cold
with
a
cordial
,
which
he
poured
out
in
her
presence
,
and
which
(
now
that
her
suspicion
was
aroused
)
<EOS>
she
refused
to
taste
,
notwithstanding
all
his
importunities
.
<EOS>
He
then
fell
upon
his
knees
before
her
,
and
the
tears
gushing
from
his
eyes
,
swore
that
his
passion
was
wound
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
impatience
,
that
he
could
no
longer
live
upon
the
unsubstantial
food
of
expectation
;
and
that
,
if
she
would
not
vouchsafe
to
crown
his
happiness
,
he
would
forthwith
sacrifice
himself
to
her
disdain
.
<EOS>
Such
an
abrupt
address
,
accompanied
with
all
the
symptoms
of
frantic
agitation
,
could
not
fail
to
perplex
and
affright
the
gentle
Emilia
,
who
,
after
some
recollection
,
replied
with
a
resolute
tone
,
that
she
could
not
see
what
reason
he
had
to
complain
of
her
reserve
,
which
she
was
not
at
liberty
to
lay
intirely
aside
,
until
he
should
have
avowed
his
intentions
in
form
,
and
obtained
the
sanction
of
those
whom
it
was
her
duty
to
obey
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Divine
creature
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
,
seizing
her
hand
,
and
pressing
it
to
his
lips
)
<EOS>
it
is
from
you
alone
<EOS>
I
hope
for
that
condescension
,
which
would
overwhelm
me
with
transports
of
celestial
bliss
.
<EOS>
The
sentiments
of
parents
are
sordid
,
silly
,
and
confined
;
seek
not
then
to
subject
my
passion
to
such
low
restrictions
as
were
calculated
for
the
purposes
of
common
life
.
<EOS>
My
love
is
too
delicate
and
refined
,
to
wear
those
vulgar
fetters
,
which
serve
only
to
destroy
the
merit
of
voluntary
affection
,
and
to
upbraid
a
man
incessantly
with
the
articles
of
compulsion
,
under
which
he
lies
.
<EOS>
My
dear
angel
!
<EOS>
spare
me
the
mortification
of
being
compelled
to
love
you
,
and
reign
sole
empress
of
my
heart
and
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
not
affront
you
so
much
as
to
talk
of
settlements
;
my
all
is
at
your
disposal
.
<EOS>
In
this
pocket
-
pook
are
notes
to
the
amount
of
two
thousand
pounds
;
do
me
the
pleasure
to
accept
of
them
;
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
will
lay
ten
thousand
more
in
your
lap
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
you
shall
be
mistress
of
my
whole
estate
,
and
I
shall
think
myself
happy
in
living
dependent
on
your
bounty
!
"
    
<EOS>
Heavens
!
<EOS>
what
were
the
emotions
of
the
virtuous
,
the
sensible
,
the
delicate
,
the
tender
Emilia
's
heart
,
when
she
heard
this
insolent
declaration
from
the
mouth
of
a
man
,
whom
she
had
honoured
with
her
affection
and
esteem
!
<EOS>
It
was
not
simply
horror
,
grief
,
or
indignation
that
she
felt
,
in
consequence
of
this
unworthy
treatment
,
but
the
united
pangs
of
all
together
,
which
produced
a
sort
of
hysteric
laugh
,
while
she
told
him
,
that
she
could
not
help
admiring
his
generosity
.
    
<EOS>
Deceived
by
this
convulsion
,
and
the
ironical
compliment
that
attended
it
,
the
lover
thought
he
had
already
made
great
progress
in
his
operations
,
and
that
it
was
now
his
business
to
storm
the
fort
by
a
vigorous
assault
,
that
he
might
spare
her
the
confusion
of
yielding
without
resistance
.
<EOS>
Possessed
by
this
vain
suggestion
,
he
started
up
,
and
folding
her
in
his
arms
,
began
to
obey
the
furious
dictates
of
his
unruly
and
ungenerous
desire
;
upon
which
,
with
an
air
of
cool
determination
,
she
demanded
a
parley
;
and
when
,
upon
her
repeated
request
,
he
granted
it
,
addressed
herself
to
him
in
these
words
,
while
her
eyes
gleamed
with
all
the
dignity
of
the
most
awful
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
I
scorn
to
upbraid
you
with
a
repetition
of
your
former
vows
and
protestations
,
nor
will
I
recapitulate
the
little
arts
you
have
practised
to
ensnare
my
heart
;
because
,
though
by
dint
of
the
most
perfidious
dissimulation
,
you
have
found
means
to
deceive
my
opinion
,
your
utmost
efforts
have
never
been
able
to
lull
the
vigilance
of
my
conduct
,
or
to
engage
my
affection
beyond
the
power
of
discarding
you
without
a
tear
,
whenever
my
honour
should
demand
such
a
sacrifice
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
are
unworthy
of
my
concern
or
regret
,
and
the
sigh
that
now
struggles
from
my
breast
,
is
the
result
of
sorrow
,
for
my
own
want
of
discernment
.
<EOS>
As
for
your
present
attempt
upon
my
chastity
,
I
despise
your
power
,
as
I
detest
your
intention
.
<EOS>
Though
,
under
the
mask
of
the
most
delicate
respect
,
you
have
decoyed
me
from
the
immediate
protection
of
my
friends
,
and
contrived
other
impious
stratagems
to
ruin
my
peace
and
reputation
,
I
confide
too
much
in
my
own
innocence
,
and
the
authority
of
the
law
,
to
admit
one
thought
of
fear
,
much
less
to
sink
under
the
horror
of
this
shocking
situation
,
into
which
I
have
been
seduced
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
your
behaviour
on
this
occasion
,
is
in
all
respects
low
and
contemptible
:
for
,
ruffian
as
you
are
,
you
durst
not
harbour
one
thought
of
executing
your
execrable
scheme
,
while
you
knew
my
brother
was
near
enough
to
prevent
,
or
revenge
the
insult
;
so
that
you
must
not
only
be
a
treacherous
villain
,
but
also
a
most
despicable
coward
.
"
<EOS>
Having
expressed
herself
in
this
manner
,
with
a
most
majestic
severity
of
aspect
,
she
opened
the
door
,
and
walked
down
stairs
with
surprising
resolution
,
committed
herself
to
the
care
of
a
watchman
,
who
accommodated
her
with
a
hackney
-
chair
,
in
which
she
was
safely
conveyed
to
her
uncle
's
house
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
lover
was
so
confounded
and
over
-
awed
,
by
these
cutting
reproaches
,
and
her
animated
behaviour
,
that
all
his
resolution
forsook
him
,
and
he
found
himself
not
only
incapable
of
obstructing
her
retreat
,
but
even
of
uttering
one
syllable
to
deprecate
her
wrath
,
or
extenuate
the
guilt
of
his
own
conduct
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
his
disappointment
,
and
the
keen
remorse
that
seized
him
,
when
he
reflected
upon
the
dishonourable
predicament
in
which
his
character
stood
with
Emilia
,
raised
such
perturbation
in
his
mind
,
that
his
silence
was
succeeded
by
a
violent
fit
of
distraction
,
during
which
he
raved
like
A
Bedlamite
,
and
acted
a
thousand
extravagancies
,
which
convinced
the
people
of
the
house
,
(
a
certain
bagnio
)
that
he
had
actually
lost
his
wits
.
<EOS>
Pipes
,
with
great
concern
,
adopted
the
same
opinion
;
and
,
being
assisted
by
the
waiters
,
hindered
him
,
by
main
force
,
from
running
out
and
pursuing
the
fair
fugitive
,
whom
,
in
his
delirium
,
he
alternately
cursed
and
commended
,
with
horrid
imprecations
,
and
lavish
applause
.
<EOS>
His
faithful
valet
,
having
waited
two
whole
hours
,
in
hope
of
seeing
this
gust
of
passion
overblown
,
and
perceiving
that
the
paroxysm
seemed
rather
to
increase
,
very
prudently
sent
for
a
physician
of
his
master
's
acquaintance
,
who
having
considered
the
circumstances
and
symptoms
of
the
disorder
,
directed
,
that
he
should
be
plentifully
blooded
,
without
loss
of
time
,
and
prescribed
a
draught
to
compose
the
tumult
of
his
spirits
.
    
<EOS>
These
orders
being
punctually
performed
,
he
grew
more
calm
and
tractable
,
recovered
his
reflection
so
far
,
as
to
be
ashamed
of
the
extasy
he
had
undergone
,
suffered
himself
quietly
to
be
undressed
,
and
put
to
bed
,
where
the
fatigue
occasioned
by
his
exercise
at
the
masquerade
,
co
-
operated
with
the
present
dissipation
of
his
spirits
to
lull
him
in
a
profound
found
sleep
,
which
greatly
tended
to
the
preservation
of
his
intellects
:
not
that
he
found
himself
in
a
state
of
perfect
tranquillity
,
when
he
waked
about
noon
;
the
remembrance
of
what
had
passed
overwhelmed
him
with
mortification
.
<EOS>
Emilia
's
invectives
still
sounded
in
his
ears
;
and
while
he
deeply
resented
her
disdain
,
he
could
not
help
admiring
her
spirit
,
and
in
his
heart
did
homage
to
her
charms
.

In
this
state
of
division
,
he
went
home
to
his
own
lodgings
in
a
chair
;
and
while
he
deliberated
with
himself
,
whether
he
should
relinquish
the
pursuit
,
and
endeavour
to
banish
her
idea
from
his
breast
,
or
go
immediately
and
humble
himself
before
his
exasperated
mistress
,
and
offer
his
hand
as
an
atonement
for
his
crime
,
his
servant
put
in
his
hand
a
packet
,
which
had
been
delivered
by
a
ticket
-
porter
at
the
door
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
perceived
that
the
superscription
was
in
Emilia
's
hand
-
writing
,
than
he
guessed
the
nature
of
the
contents
;
and
opening
the
seal
with
disordered
eagerness
,
found
the
jewels
he
had
given
to
her
,
inclosed
in
a
billet
couched
in
these
words
.
     
<EOS>
"
That
I
may
have
no
cause
to
reproach
myself
with
having
retained
the
least
memorial
of
a
wretch
whom
I
equally
despise
and
abhor
<EOS>
,
I
take
this
opportunity
of
restoring
these
ineffectual
instruments
of
his
infamous
design
upon
the
honour
of
 
Emilia
.
"
    
<EOS>
His
chagrin
was
so
much
galled
and
inflamed
by
the
bitterness
of
this
contemptuous
message
,
that
he
gnawed
his
fingers
till
the
blood
ran
over
his
nails
,
and
even
wept
with
vexation
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
vowed
revenge
against
her
haughty
virtue
,
and
reviled
himself
for
his
precipitate
declaration
,
before
his
scheme
was
brought
to
maturity
;
then
he
would
consider
her
behaviour
with
reverence
and
regard
,
and
bow
before
the
irresistible
power
of
her
attractions
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
his
breast
was
torn
by
conflicting
passions
;
love
,
shame
,
and
remorse
contended
with
vanity
,
ambition
,
and
revenge
;
and
the
superiority
was
still
doubtful
,
when
headstrong
desire
interposed
,
and
decided
in
favour
of
an
attempt
towards
a
reconciliation
with
the
offended
fair
.
    
<EOS>
Impelled
by
this
motive
,
he
set
out
in
the
afternoon
for
the
house
of
her
uncle
,
not
without
hopes
of
that
tender
enjoyment
,
which
never
fails
to
attend
an
accommodation
betwixt
two
lovers
of
taste
and
sensibility
.
<EOS>
Though
the
consciousness
of
his
trespass
encumbered
him
with
an
air
of
awkward
confusion
,
he
was
too
confident
of
his
own
qualifications
and
address
to
despair
of
forgiveness
;
and
by
that
time
he
arrived
at
the
citizen
's
gate
,
he
had
conned
a
very
artful
and
pathetic
harangue
,
which
he
proposed
to
utter
in
his
own
behalf
,
laying
the
blame
of
his
conduct
on
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
incensed
by
the
Burgundy
,
which
he
had
too
liberally
drank
:
but
he
did
not
meet
with
an
opportunity
to
avail
himself
of
this
preparation
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
suspecting
that
he
would
take
some
step
of
this
kind
to
retrieve
her
favour
,
had
gone
abroad
on
pretence
of
visiting
,
after
having
signified
to
her
kinsman
,
her
resolution
to
avoid
the
company
of
Peregrine
,
on
account
of
some
ambiguities
which
(
she
said
)
were
last
night
remarkable
in
his
demeanour
,
at
the
masquerade
.
<EOS>
She
chose
to
insinuate
her
suspicions
in
these
hints
,
rather
than
give
an
explicit
detail
of
the
young
man
's
dishonourable
contrivance
,
which
might
have
kindled
the
resentment
of
the
family
to
some
dangerous
pitch
of
animosity
and
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
finding
himself
baffled
in
his
expectation
of
seeing
her
,
inquired
for
the
old
gentleman
,
with
whom
he
thought
he
had
influence
enough
to
make
his
apology
good
,
in
case
he
should
find
him
prepossessed
by
the
young
lady
's
information
.
<EOS>
But
here
too
he
was
disappointed
;
the
uncle
had
gone
to
dine
in
the
country
,
and
his
wife
was
indisposed
;
so
that
he
had
no
pretext
for
staying
in
the
house
,
till
the
return
of
his
charmer
.
<EOS>
Being
,
however
,
fruitful
of
expedients
,
he
dismissed
his
chariot
,
and
took
possession
of
a
room
in
a
tavern
,
the
windows
of
which
fronted
the
merchant
's
gate
;
and
there
he
proposed
to
watch
until
he
should
see
her
approach
.
<EOS>
This
scheme
he
put
in
practice
with
indefatigable
patience
,
though
it
was
not
attended
with
the
expected
success
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
whose
caution
was
equally
vigilant
and
commendable
,
foreseeing
that
she
might
be
exposed
to
the
fertility
of
his
invention
,
came
home
by
a
private
passage
,
and
entered
by
a
postern
,
which
was
altogether
unknown
to
her
admirer
;
and
her
uncle
did
not
arrive
,
until
it
was
so
late
,
that
he
could
not
with
any
decency
demand
a
conference
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
he
did
not
fail
to
present
himself
at
the
door
,
and
his
mistress
being
denied
by
her
own
express
direction
,
insisted
upon
seeing
the
master
of
the
house
,
who
received
him
with
such
coldness
of
civility
,
as
plainly
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
displeasure
of
his
niece
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
with
an
air
of
candour
,
told
the
citizen
,
he
could
easily
perceive
,
by
his
behaviour
,
that
he
was
the
confidant
of
Miss
Emily
,
of
whom
he
was
come
to
ask
pardon
for
the
offence
he
had
given
;
and
did
not
doubt
,
if
he
could
be
admitted
to
her
presence
,
that
he
should
be
able
to
convince
her
,
that
he
had
not
erred
intentionally
,
or
at
least
propose
such
reparation
,
as
would
effectually
atone
for
his
fault
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
remonstrance
<EOS>
the
merchant
,
without
any
ceremony
or
circumlocution
,
answered
,
that
though
he
was
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
his
offence
,
he
was
very
certain
,
that
it
must
have
been
something
very
flagrant
,
that
could
irritate
his
niece
to
such
a
degree
,
against
a
person
for
whom
she
had
formerly
a
most
particular
regard
.
<EOS>
He
owned
,
she
had
declared
her
intention
to
renounce
his
acquaintance
for
ever
,
and
,
doubtless
,
she
had
good
reason
for
so
doing
;
neither
would
he
undertake
to
promote
an
accommodation
,
unless
he
would
give
him
full
power
to
treat
on
the
score
of
matrimony
,
which
he
supposed
would
be
the
only
means
of
evincing
his
own
sincerity
,
and
obtaining
Emilia
's
forgiveness
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
pride
was
kindled
by
this
blunt
declaration
,
which
he
could
not
help
considering
as
the
result
of
a
scheme
concerted
betwixt
the
young
lady
and
her
uncle
,
in
order
to
take
the
advantage
of
his
heat
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
replied
,
with
manifest
signs
of
disgust
,
that
he
did
not
apprehend
there
was
any
occasion
for
a
mediator
to
reconcile
<EOS>
the
difference
betwixt
Emilia
and
him
;
and
that
all
he
desired
,
was
an
opportunity
of
pleading
in
his
own
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
The
citizen
frankly
told
him
,
that
as
his
niece
had
expressed
an
earnest
desire
of
avoiding
his
company
,
he
would
not
put
the
least
constraint
upon
her
inclination
;
and
in
the
mean
time
gave
him
to
know
,
that
he
was
particularly
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
glowing
with
indignation
at
this
supercilious
treatment
;
"
I
was
in
the
wrong
(
said
he
)
to
look
for
good
manners
,
so
far
on
this
side
of
Temple
-
bar
:
<EOS>
but
,
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
Sir
,
that
unless
I
am
favoured
with
an
interview
with
Miss
Gauntlet
,
I
shall
conclude
,
that
you
have
actually
laid
a
constraint
upon
her
inclination
,
for
some
sinister
purposes
of
your
own
.
"
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
replied
the
old
gentleman
)
<EOS>
you
are
welcome
to
make
what
conclusions
shall
seem
good
unto
your
own
imagination
;
but
,
pray
be
so
good
as
to
allow
me
the
privilege
of
being
master
in
my
own
house
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
very
complaisantly
shewed
him
to
the
door
;
and
our
lover
,
being
diffident
of
his
own
temper
,
as
well
as
afraid
of
being
used
with
greater
indignity
,
in
a
place
where
his
personal
prowess
would
only
serve
to
heighten
his
disgrace
,
quitted
the
house
in
a
transport
of
rage
which
he
could
not
wholly
suppress
,
telling
the
landlord
,
that
if
his
age
did
not
protect
him
,
he
would
have
chastised
him
for
his
insolent
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
LXXXIV
<EOS>
He
projects
a
violent
scheme
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
is
involved
in
a
most
fatiguing
adventure
,
which
greatly
tends
towards
the
augmentation
of
his
chagrin
.
   
<EOS>
Thus
debarred
of
personal
communication
with
his
mistress
,
he
essayed
to
retrieve
her
good
graces
by
the
most
submissive
and
pathetic
letters
,
which
he
conveyed
by
<EOS>
divers
artifices
to
her
perusal
;
but
reaping
no
manner
of
benefit
from
these
endeavours
,
his
passion
acquired
a
degree
of
impatience
,
little
inferior
to
downright
frenzy
;
and
he
determined
to
run
every
risk
of
life
,
fortune
,
and
reputation
,
rather
than
desist
from
his
unjustifiable
pursuit
.
<EOS>
Indeed
his
resentment
was
now
as
deeply
concerned
as
his
love
,
and
each
of
these
passions
equally
turbulent
and
loud
in
demanding
gratification
.
<EOS>
He
kept
centinels
continually
in
pay
,
to
give
him
notice
of
her
outgoings
,
in
expectation
of
finding
some
opportunity
to
carry
her
off
;
but
her
circumspection
entirely
frustrated
this
design
;
for
she
suspected
every
thing
of
that
sort
from
a
disposition
like
his
,
and
regulated
her
motions
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
Baffled
by
her
prudence
and
penetration
,
he
altered
his
plan
,
and
,
on
pretence
of
being
called
to
his
country
-
house
by
some
affair
of
importance
,
he
departed
from
London
,
and
taking
lodgings
at
a
farmer
's
house
,
that
stood
near
the
road
through
which
she
must
have
necessarily
passed
,
in
her
return
to
her
mother
,
concealed
himself
from
all
intercourse
,
except
with
his
valet
de
chambre
and
Pipes
,
who
had
orders
to
scour
the
country
,
and
reconnoitre
every
horse
,
coach
,
or
carriage
,
that
should
appear
on
that
high
way
,
with
a
view
of
intercepting
his
Amanda
in
her
passage
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
waited
in
this
ambuscade
a
whole
week
,
when
his
valet
gave
him
notice
,
that
he
and
his
fellow
-
scout
had
discovered
a
chaise
and
six
,
driving
at
full
speed
towards
them
;
upon
which
,
they
had
flapped
their
hats
over
their
eyes
,
so
as
that
they
might
not
be
known
,
in
case
they
should
be
seen
,
and
concealed
themselves
behind
a
hedge
,
from
whence
they
could
perceive
in
the
carriage
,
as
it
passed
,
a
young
man
plainly
dressed
,
with
a
lady
in
a
mask
,
of
the
exact
size
,
shape
,
and
air
of
Emilia
;
and
that
Pipes
followed
them
at
a
distance
,
while
he
rode
back
to
communicate
this
piece
of
intelligence
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
would
scarce
allow
him
time
to
conclude
his
information
;
he
ran
down
to
the
stable
,
where
his
horse
was
kept
ready
saddled
for
the
purpose
,
and
never
doubting
that
the
lady
in
question
was
his
mistress
,
attended
by
one
of
her
uncle
's
clerks
,
mounted
immediately
,
and
rode
full
gallop
after
the
chaise
,
which
(
when
he
had
proceeded
about
two
miles
)
<EOS>
he
understood
from
Pipes
,
had
put
up
at
a
neighbouring
inn
.
    
<EOS>
Though
his
inclination
prompted
him
to
enter
her
apartment
without
farther
delay
,
he
suffered
himself
to
be
dissuaded
from
taking
such
a
precipitate
step
,
by
his
privy
counsellor
,
who
observed
,
that
it
would
be
impracticable
to
execute
his
purpose
of
conveying
her
against
her
will
from
a
public
inn
,
that
stood
in
the
midst
of
a
populous
village
,
which
would
infallibly
rise
in
her
defence
;
and
advised
him
to
lie
in
wait
for
the
chaise
,
in
some
remote
and
private
part
of
the
road
,
where
they
might
accomplish
their
aim
without
difficulty
or
danger
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
admonition
,
our
adventurer
ordered
Pipes
to
reconnoitre
the
inn
,
that
she
might
not
escape
another
way
,
while
he
and
the
valet
,
in
order
to
avoid
being
seen
,
took
a
circuit
by
an
unfrequented
path
,
and
placed
themselves
in
ambush
,
on
a
spot
which
they
chose
for
the
scene
of
their
atchievement
.
<EOS>
Here
they
tarried
a
full
hour
,
without
seeing
the
carriage
,
or
hearing
from
their
centinel
;
so
that
the
youth
,
unable
to
exert
his
patience
one
moment
longer
,
left
the
foreigner
in
his
station
,
and
rode
back
to
his
faithful
lacquey
,
who
assured
him
,
that
the
travellers
had
not
yet
hove
up
their
anchor
,
or
proceeded
on
their
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
intimation
,
Pickle
began
to
entertain
such
alarming
suspicions
,
that
he
could
not
refrain
from
advancing
to
the
gate
,
and
inquiring
for
the
company
which
had
lately
arrived
in
a
chaise
and
six
.
<EOS>
The
inn
-
keeper
,
who
was
not
at
all
pleased
with
the
behaviour
of
those
passengers
,
did
not
think
proper
to
observe
the
instructions
he
had
received
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
plainly
told
him
,
that
the
chaise
did
not
halt
,
but
only
entered
at
one
door
,
and
went
out
at
the
other
,
with
a
view
to
deceive
those
who
pursued
it
,
as
he
guessed
from
the
words
of
the
gentleman
,
who
had
earnestly
desired
,
that
his
route
might
be
concealed
from
any
person
who
should
inquire
about
their
motions
.
"
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
peart
,
measter
,
(
continued
this
charitable
publican
)
<EOS>
I
believes
as
how
they
are
no
better
than
they
should
be
,
else
they
would
n't
be
in
such
a
deadly
fear
of
being
overtaken
.
    
<EOS>
Methinks
,
(
said
I
)
when
I
saw
them
in
such
a
woundy
pother
to
be
gone
,
oddsheartikins
!
<EOS>
this
must
be
some
Lundon
prentice
running
away
with
his
measter
's
daughter
,
as
sure
as
I
'm
a
living
soul
.
<EOS>
But
,
be
he
who
will
,
sartain
it
is
,
a
has
nothing
of
the
gentleman
about
en
;
for
,
thof
a
axed
such
a
favour
,
a
never
once
put
hand
in
pocket
,
or
said
,
"
Dog
,
will
you
drink
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Howsomever
,
that
do
n't
argufy
in
reverence
of
his
being
in
a
hurry
;
and
a
man
may
be
sometimes
a
little
too
judgmatical
in
his
conjunctures
.
<EOS>
"
In
all
probability
,
this
loquacious
landlord
would
have
served
the
travellers
effectually
,
had
Peregrine
heard
him
to
an
end
;
but
this
impetuous
youth
,
far
from
listening
to
the
sequel
of
his
observations
,
interrupted
him
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
by
asking
eagerly
,
which
road
they
followed
;
and
having
received
the
inn
-
keeper
's
directions
,
clapp'd
spurs
to
his
horse
,
commanding
Pipes
to
make
the
valet
acquainted
with
his
course
,
that
they
might
attend
him
with
all
imaginable
dispatch
.
    
<EOS>
By
the
publican
's
account
of
their
conduct
,
his
former
opinion
was
fully
confirmed
;
he
plied
his
steed
to
the
height
of
his
mettle
,
and
so
much
was
his
imagination
ingrossed
by
the
prospect
of
having
Emilia
in
his
power
,
that
he
did
not
perceive
the
road
on
which
he
travelled
,
was
quite
different
from
that
which
led
to
the
habitation
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
.
<EOS>
The
valet
de
chambre
was
an
utter
stranger
to
that
part
of
the
country
;
and
as
for
Mr
Pipes
,
such
considerations
were
altogether
foreign
to
the
oeconomy
of
his
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
Ten
long
miles
had
our
hero
rode
,
when
his
eyes
were
blessed
with
the
sight
of
the
chaise
ascending
an
hill
,
at
the
distance
of
a
good
league
;
upon
which
,
he
doubled
his
diligence
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
gained
upon
the
carriage
every
minute
,
and
at
length
approached
so
near
to
it
that
he
could
discern
the
lady
and
her
conductor
,
with
their
heads
thrust
out
at
the
windows
,
looking
back
,
and
speaking
to
the
driver
alternately
,
as
if
they
earnestly
besought
him
to
augment
the
speed
of
his
cattle
.
    
<EOS>
Being
thus
,
as
it
were
,
in
sight
of
port
,
while
he
crossed
the
road
,
his
horse
happened
to
plunge
into
a
cart
-
rut
,
with
such
violence
,
that
he
was
thrown
several
yards
over
his
head
;
and
the
beast
's
shoulder
being
slipt
by
the
fall
,
he
found
himself
disabled
from
plucking
the
fruit
,
which
was
almost
within
his
reach
;
for
he
had
left
his
servants
at
a
considerable
distance
behind
him
;
and
although
they
had
been
at
his
back
,
and
supplied
him
with
another
horse
,
they
were
so
indifferently
mounted
,
that
he
could
not
reasonably
expect
to
overtake
the
flyers
,
who
profited
so
much
by
this
disaster
,
that
the
chaise
vanished
in
a
moment
.
    
<EOS>
It
may
be
easily
conceived
,
how
a
young
man
of
his
disposition
passed
his
time
,
in
this
tantalizing
situation
.
<EOS>
He
ejaculated
with
great
fervency
,
but
his
prayers
were
not
the
effects
of
resignation
.
<EOS>
He
ran
back
on
foot
with
incredible
speed
,
in
order
to
meet
his
valet
,
whom
he
unhorsed
in
a
twinkling
;
and
taking
his
seat
,
began
to
exercise
his
whip
and
spurs
,
after
having
ordered
the
Swiss
to
follow
him
on
the
other
gelding
,
and
commit
the
lame
hunter
to
the
care
of
Pipes
.
    
<EOS>
Matters
being
adjusted
in
this
manner
,
our
adventurer
prosecuted
the
race
with
all
his
might
;
and
having
made
some
progress
,
was
informed
by
a
countryman
,
that
the
chaise
had
struck
off
into
another
road
,
and
,
according
to
his
judgment
,
was
by
that
time
about
three
miles
ahead
;
though
,
in
all
probability
,
the
horses
would
not
be
able
to
hold
out
much
longer
,
because
they
seemed
to
be
quite
spent
when
they
passed
his
door
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
intimation
,
Peregrine
pushed
on
with
great
alacrity
;
though
he
could
not
regain
sight
of
the
desired
object
,
till
the
clouds
of
night
began
to
deepen
,
and
even
then
he
enjoyed
nothing
more
than
a
transient
glimpse
;
for
the
carriage
was
no
sooner
seen
,
than
shrouded
again
from
his
view
.
<EOS>
These
vexatious
circumstances
animated
his
endeavours
,
while
they
irritated
his
chagrin
;
and
in
short
,
he
continued
his
pursuit
till
the
night
was
far
advanced
,
and
himself
so
uncertain
about
the
object
of
his
care
,
that
he
entered
a
solitary
inn
,
with
a
view
of
obtaining
some
intelligence
,
and
to
his
infinite
joy
,
perceived
the
chaise
standing
by
itself
,
and
the
horses
panting
in
the
yard
.
<EOS>
In
full
confidence
of
his
having
arrived
at
last
at
the
goal
of
all
his
wishes
,
he
alighted
instantaneously
,
and
running
up
to
the
coachman
,
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
,
commanded
him
,
in
an
imperious
tone
,
to
conduct
him
to
the
lady
's
chamber
,
on
pain
of
death
.
<EOS>
The
driver
,
affrighted
at
this
menacing
address
,
protested
with
great
humility
,
that
he
did
not
know
whither
his
fare
had
retired
;
for
that
he
himself
was
paid
and
dismissed
from
this
service
,
because
he
would
not
undertake
to
drive
them
all
night
cross
the
country
,
without
stopping
to
refresh
his
horses
:
but
he
promised
to
go
in
quest
of
the
waiter
,
who
would
shew
him
to
their
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
accordingly
detached
on
that
errand
,
while
our
hero
stood
centinel
at
the
gate
,
till
the
arrival
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
joining
him
by
accident
,
before
the
coachman
returned
,
relieved
him
in
his
watch
;
and
then
the
young
gentleman
,
exasperated
at
his
messenger
's
delay
,
rushed
with
fury
in
his
eyes
from
room
to
room
,
denouncing
vengeance
upon
the
whole
family
;
but
he
did
not
meet
with
one
living
soul
,
until
he
entered
the
garret
,
where
he
found
the
landlord
and
his
wife
in
bed
.
<EOS>
This
chicken
-
hearted
couple
,
by
the
light
of
a
rush
-
candle
that
burned
on
the
hearth
,
seeing
a
stranger
burst
into
the
chamber
,
in
such
a
terrible
attitude
,
were
seized
with
consternation
;
and
exalting
their
voices
,
in
a
most
lamentable
strain
,
begg'd
for
the
passion
of
Christ
,
that
he
would
spare
their
lives
,
and
take
all
they
had
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
guessing
from
this
exclamation
,
and
the
circumstance
of
their
being
abed
,
that
they
mistook
him
for
a
robber
,
and
were
ignorant
of
that
which
he
wanted
to
know
,
dispelled
their
terror
,
by
making
them
acquainted
with
the
cause
of
his
visit
,
and
desired
the
husband
to
get
up
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
in
order
to
assist
and
attend
him
in
his
search
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
reinforced
,
he
rummaged
every
corner
of
the
inn
,
and
at
last
finding
the
ostler
in
the
stable
,
was
by
him
informed
,
(
to
his
unspeakable
mortification
)
that
the
gentleman
and
lady
who
arrived
in
the
chaise
,
had
immediately
hired
post
-
horses
for
a
certain
village
at
the
distance
of
fifteen
miles
,
and
departed
without
halting
for
the
least
refreshment
.
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
mad
with
his
disappointment
,
mounted
his
horse
in
an
instant
,
and
,
with
his
attendant
,
took
the
same
road
,
with
full
determination
to
die
,
rather
than
desist
from
the
prosecution
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
,
by
this
time
,
rodeupwards
of
thirty
miles
since
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
so
that
the
horses
were
almost
quite
jaded
,
and
travelled
this
stage
so
slowly
,
that
it
was
morning
before
they
reached
the
place
of
their
destination
,
where
,
far
from
finding
the
fugitives
,
he
understood
,
that
no
such
persons
as
he
described
had
passed
that
way
,
and
that
,
in
all
likelihood
,
they
had
taken
a
quite
contrary
direction
,
while
,
in
order
to
mislead
him
in
his
pursuit
,
they
had
amused
the
hostler
with
a
false
route
.
<EOS>
This
conjecture
was
strengthned
,
by
his
perceiving
(
now
for
the
first
time
)
that
he
had
deviated
a
considerable
way
from
the
road
,
through
which
they
must
have
journeyed
,
in
order
to
arrive
at
the
place
of
her
mother
's
residence
;
and
these
suggestions
utterly
deprived
him
of
the
small
remains
of
recollection
,
which
he
had
hitherto
retained
.
<EOS>
His
eyes
rolled
about
,
witnessing
rage
and
distraction
;
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
,
stamped
upon
the
ground
with
great
violence
,
uttered
incoherent
imprecations
against
himself
and
all
mankind
,
and
would
have
sallied
forth
again
he
knew
not
whither
,
upon
the
same
horse
,
which
he
had
already
almost
killed
with
fatigue
,
had
not
his
confident
found
means
to
quiet
the
tumult
of
his
thoughts
,
and
recal
his
reflection
,
by
representing
the
condition
of
the
poor
animals
,
and
advising
him
to
hire
fresh
horses
,
and
ride
post
across
the
country
,
to
the
village
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Mrs
Gauntlet
's
habitation
,
where
they
should
infallibly
intercept
the
daughter
,
provided
they
could
get
the
start
of
her
upon
the
road
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
not
only
relished
,
but
forthwith
acted
in
conformity
with
this
good
counsel
.
    
<EOS>
His
own
horses
were
committed
to
the
charge
of
the
landlord
,
with
directions
for
Pipes
,
in
case
he
should
come
thither
in
quest
of
his
master
;
and
a
couple
of
stout
geldings
being
prepared
<EOS>
,
he
and
his
valet
took
the
road
again
,
steering
their
course
according
to
the
motions
of
the
post
-
boy
,
who
undertook
to
be
their
guide
.
<EOS>
They
had
almost
finished
the
first
stage
,
when
they
descried
a
post
-
chaise
just
halting
at
the
inn
where
they
proposed
to
change
horses
;
upon
which
,
our
adventurer
,
glowing
with
a
most
interesting
presage
,
put
his
beast
to
the
full
speed
,
and
approached
near
enough
to
distinguish
,
(
as
the
travellers
quitted
the
carriage
)
<EOS>
that
he
had
at
last
come
up
with
the
very
individual
persons
whom
he
had
pursued
so
long
.
    
<EOS>
Flushed
with
the
discovery
,
he
galloped
into
the
yard
so
suddenly
,
that
the
lady
and
her
conductor
scarce
had
time
to
shut
themselves
up
in
a
chamber
,
to
which
they
retreated
with
great
precipitation
;
so
that
the
pursuer
was
now
certain
of
having
housed
his
prey
.
<EOS>
That
he
might
,
however
,
leave
nothing
to
fortune
,
he
placed
himself
upon
the
stair
,
by
which
they
had
ascended
to
the
apartment
,
and
sent
up
his
compliments
to
the
young
lady
,
desiring
the
favour
of
being
admitted
to
her
presence
,
otherwise
he
should
be
obliged
to
wave
all
ceremony
,
and
take
that
liberty
which
she
would
not
give
.
<EOS>
The
servant
having
conveyed
this
message
through
the
keyhole
,
returned
with
an
answer
,
importing
,
that
she
would
adhere
to
the
resolution
she
had
taken
,
and
perish
rather
than
comply
with
his
will
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
,
without
staying
to
make
any
rejoinder
to
this
reply
,
ran
up
stairs
,
and
thundering
at
the
door
for
entrance
,
was
given
to
understand
by
the
nymph
's
attendant
,
that
a
blunderbuss
was
ready
primed
for
his
reception
,
and
that
he
would
do
well
to
spare
him
the
necessity
of
shedding
blood
,
in
defence
of
a
person
who
had
put
herself
under
his
protection
.
<EOS>
"
All
the
laws
of
the
land
(
said
he
)
can
not
now
untie
the
knots
by
which
we
are
bound
together
;
and
therefore
I
will
guard
her
as
my
own
property
;
so
that
you
had
better
desist
from
your
fruitless
attempt
,
and
thereby
consult
your
own
safety
:
for
,
by
the
God
that
made
me
!
<EOS>
I
will
discharge
my
piece
upon
you
,
as
soon
as
you
set
your
nose
within
the
door
;
and
your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head
.
"
<EOS>
These
menaces
from
a
citizen
's
clerk
,
would
have
been
sufficient
motives
for
Pickle
to
storm
the
breach
,
although
they
had
not
been
reinforced
by
that
declaration
,
which
informed
him
of
Emilia
's
having
bestowed
herself
in
marriage
upon
such
a
contemptible
rival
.
<EOS>
This
sole
consideration
added
wings
to
his
impetuosity
,
and
he
applied
his
foot
to
the
door
with
such
irresistible
force
,
as
bursted
it
open
in
an
instant
,
entering
at
the
same
time
with
a
pistol
ready
<EOS>
cock'd
<EOS>
in
his
hand
.
<EOS>
His
antagonist
,
instead
of
firing
his
blunderbuss
,
when
he
saw
him
approach
,
started
back
,
with
evident
signs
of
surprize
and
consternation
,
exclaiming
,
"
Lord
Jesus
!
<EOS>
Sir
,
you
are
not
the
man
!
<EOS>
and
,
without
doubt
,
are
under
some
mistake
with
regard
to
us
.
"
    
<EOS>
Before
Peregrine
had
time
to
answer
this
salutation
,
the
lady
hearing
it
,
advanced
to
him
,
and
pulling
off
a
mask
,
discovered
a
face
which
he
had
never
seen
before
.
<EOS>
The
Gorgon
's
head
,
according
to
the
fables
of
antiquity
,
never
had
a
more
instantaneous
or
petrifying
effect
,
than
that
which
this
countenance
produced
upon
the
astonished
youth
.
    
<EOS>
His
eyes
were
fixed
upon
this
unknown
object
,
as
if
they
had
been
attracted
by
the
power
of
inchantment
,
his
feet
seemed
rivetted
to
the
ground
,
and
after
having
stood
motionless
for
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
,
he
dropped
down
in
an
apoplexy
of
disappointment
and
despair
.
<EOS>
The
Swiss
,
who
had
followed
him
,
seeing
his
master
in
this
condition
,
lifted
him
up
,
and
laying
him
upon
a
bed
in
the
next
room
,
let
him
blood
immediately
,
without
hesitation
,
being
always
provided
with
a
case
of
lancets
,
against
all
accidents
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
To
this
foresight
our
hero
,
in
all
probability
,
was
indebted
for
his
life
.
<EOS>
By
virtue
of
a
very
copious
evacuation
,
he
recovered
the
use
of
his
senses
;
but
the
complication
of
fatigues
,
and
violent
transports
which
he
had
undergone
,
brewed
up
a
dangerous
fever
in
his
blood
;
and
a
physician
being
called
from
the
next
market
-
town
,
several
days
elapsed
before
he
would
answer
for
his
life
.

Chapter
LXXXV
Peregrine
sends
a
message
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
who
rejects
his
proposal
.
<EOS>
He
repairs
to
the
garison
.
   
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
his
constitution
overcame
his
disease
,
though
not
before
it
had
in
a
great
measure
tamed
the
fury
of
his
disposition
,
and
brought
him
to
a
serious
consideration
of
his
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
humiliation
of
his
spirits
,
he
reflected
with
shame
and
remorse
upon
his
treachery
to
the
fair
,
the
innocent
Emilia
;
he
remembered
his
former
sentiments
in
her
favour
,
as
well
as
the
injunctions
of
his
dying
uncle
;
he
recollected
his
intimacy
with
her
brother
,
against
which
he
had
so
basely
sinned
;
and
revolving
all
the
circumstances
of
her
conduct
,
found
it
so
commendable
,
spirited
,
and
noble
,
that
he
deemed
her
an
object
of
sufficient
dignity
to
merit
his
honourable
addresses
,
even
though
his
duty
had
not
been
concerned
in
the
decision
:
but
,
obligated
as
he
was
,
to
make
reparation
to
a
worthy
family
,
which
he
had
so
grosly
injured
,
he
thought
he
could
not
manifest
his
reformation
too
soon
;
and
,
whenever
he
found
himself
able
to
hold
the
pen
,
wrote
a
letter
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
wherein
he
acknowledged
,
with
many
expressions
of
sorrow
and
contrition
,
that
he
had
acted
a
part
altogether
unbecoming
a
man
of
honour
,
and
should
never
enjoy
the
least
tranquillity
of
mind
,
until
he
should
have
merited
her
forgiveness
.
<EOS>
He
protested
,
that
although
his
happiness
intirely
depended
upon
the
determination
of
Emilia
,
he
would
even
renounce
all
hope
of
being
blessed
with
her
favour
,
if
she
could
point
out
any
other
method
of
making
reparation
to
that
amiable
young
lady
,
but
by
laying
his
heart
and
fortune
at
her
feet
,
and
submitting
himself
to
her
pleasure
during
the
remaining
part
of
his
life
.
<EOS>
He
conjured
her
,
therefore
,
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
,
to
pardon
him
,
in
consideration
of
his
sincere
repentance
,
and
use
her
maternal
influence
with
her
daughter
,
so
as
that
he
might
be
permitted
to
wait
upon
her
with
a
wedding
-
ring
,
as
soon
as
his
health
would
allow
him
to
undertake
the
journey
.
    
<EOS>
This
explanation
being
dispatched
by
Pipes
,
who
had
,
by
this
time
,
found
his
master
,
the
young
gentleman
inquired
about
the
couple
whom
he
had
so
unfortunately
pursued
,
and
understood
from
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
learn'd
the
story
from
their
own
mouths
,
that
the
lady
was
the
only
daughter
of
a
rich
Jew
,
and
her
attendant
no
other
than
his
apprentice
,
who
had
converted
her
to
christianity
,
and
married
her
at
the
same
time
;
that
this
secret
having
taken
air
,
the
old
Israelite
had
contrived
a
scheme
to
separate
them
for
ever
;
and
they
being
apprized
of
his
intention
,
had
found
means
to
elope
from
his
house
,
with
a
view
of
sheltering
themselves
in
France
,
until
the
affair
could
be
made
up
:
that
seeing
three
men
ride
after
them
with
such
eagerness
and
speed
,
they
never
doubted
that
the
pursuers
were
her
father
,
accompanied
by
some
friends
or
domestics
,
and
on
that
supposition
had
fled
with
the
utmost
dispatch
and
trepidation
,
until
they
had
found
themselves
happily
undeceived
,
at
that
very
instant
,
when
they
expected
nothing
but
mischief
and
misfortune
:
and
lastly
,
the
Swiss
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
after
having
professed
some
concern
for
his
deplorable
situation
,
and
enjoyed
a
slight
refreshment
,
they
had
taken
their
departure
for
Dover
,
and
,
in
all
likelihood
,
were
safely
arrived
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
In
four
and
twenty
hours
after
Pipes
was
charged
with
his
commission
,
he
brought
back
an
answer
from
the
mother
of
Emilia
,
couched
in
these
words
.
    
<EOS>
"
SIR
,
I
received
the
favour
of
yours
,
and
am
glad
,
for
your
own
sake
,
that
you
have
attained
a
due
sense
and
conviction
of
your
unkind
and
unchristian
behaviour
to
poor
Emy
.
<EOS>
I
thank
God
,
none
of
my
children
were
ever
so
insulted
before
.
    
<EOS>
Give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
<EOS>
Sir
,
my
daughter
was
no
upstart
,
without
friends
or
education
,
but
a
young
lady
as
well
bred
,
and
better
born
,
than
most
private
gentlewomen
in
the
kingdom
:
and
therefore
,
though
you
had
no
esteem
for
her
person
,
you
ought
to
have
paid
some
regard
to
her
family
,
which
(
no
disparagement
to
you
,
Sir
)
is
more
honourable
than
your
own
.
<EOS>
As
for
your
proposal
,
Miss
Gauntlet
will
not
hear
of
it
,
being
,
that
she
thinks
her
honour
will
not
allow
her
to
listen
to
any
terms
of
reconciliation
;
and
she
is
not
yet
so
destitute
,
as
to
embrace
an
offer
to
which
she
has
the
least
objection
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
she
is
so
much
indisposed
,
that
she
can
not
possibly
see
company
;
so
I
beg
you
will
not
take
the
trouble
of
making
a
fruitless
journey
to
this
place
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
your
future
conduct
may
deserve
her
forgiveness
;
and
really
,
as
I
am
concerned
for
your
happiness
,
which
(
you
assure
me
)
depends
upon
her
condescension
,
I
wish
with
all
my
heart
it
may
;
and
am
(
notwithstanding
all
that
has
happened
)
 
Your
sincere
well
-
wisher
,
Cecilia
Gauntlet
.
"
    
<EOS>
From
this
epistle
,
and
the
information
of
his
messenger
,
our
hero
learn'd
,
that
his
mistress
had
actually
profited
by
his
wild
-
goose
-
chace
,
so
as
to
make
a
safe
retreat
to
her
mother
's
house
;
and
,
though
sorry
to
hear
of
her
indisposition
,
he
was
also
piqued
at
her
implacability
,
as
well
as
at
some
stately
paragraphs
of
the
letter
,
in
which
(
he
thought
)
<EOS>
the
good
lady
had
consulted
her
own
vanity
rather
than
her
good
sense
.
<EOS>
These
motives
of
resentment
helped
him
to
bear
his
disappointment
like
a
philosopher
,
especially
as
he
had
now
quieted
his
conscience
,
in
proffering
to
redress
the
injury
he
had
done
;
and
,
moreover
,
found
himself
,
with
regard
to
his
love
,
in
a
calm
state
of
hope
and
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
A
reasonable
fit
of
illness
is
an
excellent
medicine
for
the
turbulence
of
passion
.
<EOS>
Such
a
reformation
had
the
fever
produced
in
the
oeconomy
of
his
thoughts
,
that
he
moralized
like
an
apostle
,
and
projected
several
prudential
schemes
for
his
future
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
as
soon
as
his
health
was
sufficiently
re
-
established
,
he
took
a
trip
to
the
garison
,
in
order
to
visit
his
friends
;
and
learn'd
from
Hatchway
's
own
mouth
,
that
he
had
broke
the
ice
of
courtship
to
his
aunt
,
and
that
his
addresses
were
now
fairly
afloat
;
though
when
he
first
declared
himself
to
the
widow
,
after
she
had
been
duly
prepared
for
the
occasion
,
by
her
niece
and
the
rest
of
her
friends
,
she
had
received
his
proposal
with
a
becoming
reserve
,
and
piously
wept
at
the
remembrance
of
her
husband
,
observing
,
that
she
should
never
meet
with
his
fellow
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
promoted
the
lieutenant
's
suit
with
all
his
influence
;
and
all
Mrs
Trunnion
's
objections
to
the
match
being
surmounted
,
it
was
determined
,
that
the
day
of
marriage
should
be
put
off
for
three
months
,
that
her
reputation
might
not
suffer
by
a
precipitate
engagement
.
<EOS>
His
next
care
was
to
give
orders
for
erecting
a
plain
marble
monument
to
the
memory
of
his
uncle
,
on
which
the
following
inscription
,
composed
posed
by
the
bridegroom
,
actually
appeared
in
golden
letters
.

Here

Foundered

Threescore

He
kept
his

always
loaded

And
his
tackle
ready
manned
,
And
never
shewed
his

Except
when
he
took

But
,
his

being

His

burnt

And
his
upper

He
was
sunk
By

Nevertheless

He

Chapter
LXXXVI
<EOS>
He
returns
to
London
,
and
meets
with
Cadwallader
,
who
entertains
him
with
a
curious
dialogue
.
   
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
having
performed
these
last
offices
,
in
honour
of
his
deceased
benefactor
,
and
presented
Mr
Jolter
to
the
long
-
expected
living
,
which
at
this
time
happened
to
be
vacant
,
returned
to
London
,
and
resumed
his
former
gaiety
:
not
that
he
was
able
to
shake
Emilia
from
his
thoughts
,
or
even
to
remember
her
without
violent
emotions
;
for
,
as
he
recovered
his
vigour
,
his
former
impatience
recurred
,
and
therefore
he
resolved
to
plunge
himself
headlong
into
some
intrigue
,
that
might
engage
his
passions
,
and
amuse
his
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
A
man
of
his
accomplishments
could
not
fail
to
meet
with
a
variety
of
subjects
,
on
which
his
gallantry
would
have
been
properly
exercised
;
and
this
abundance
distracted
his
choice
,
which
at
any
time
was
apt
to
be
influenced
by
caprice
and
whim
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
already
observed
,
that
he
had
lifted
his
view
,
through
a
matrimonial
perspective
,
as
high
as
a
lady
of
the
first
quality
and
distinction
;
and
now
,
that
he
was
refused
by
Miss
Gauntlet
,
and
enjoyed
a
little
respite
from
the
agonies
of
that
flame
which
her
charms
had
kindled
in
his
heart
,
he
renewed
his
assiduities
to
her
grace
;
and
,
though
he
durst
not
yet
risk
an
explanation
,
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
seeing
himself
so
well
received
in
quality
of
a
particular
acquaintance
,
that
he
flattered
himself
with
the
belief
of
his
having
made
some
progress
in
her
heart
;
and
was
confirmed
in
this
conceited
notion
,
by
the
assurances
of
her
woman
,
whom
,
by
liberal
largesses
,
he
retained
in
his
interest
,
because
she
found
means
to
persuade
him
,
that
she
was
in
the
confidence
of
her
lady
.
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
this
encouragement
,
and
the
sanguine
suggestions
of
his
own
vanity
,
he
dreaded
the
thoughts
of
exposing
himself
to
her
ridicule
and
resentment
,
by
a
premature
declaration
,
and
determined
to
postpone
his
addresses
,
until
he
should
be
more
certified
of
the
probability
of
succeeding
in
his
attempt
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
remained
in
this
hesitation
and
suspence
,
he
was
one
morning
very
agreeably
surprized
with
the
appearance
of
his
friend
Crabtree
,
who
,
by
the
permission
of
Pipes
,
to
whom
he
was
well
known
,
entered
his
chamber
before
he
was
awake
,
and
,
by
a
violent
shake
of
the
shoulder
,
disengaged
him
from
the
arms
of
sleep
.
<EOS>
The
first
compliments
having
mutually
passed
,
Cadwallader
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
had
arrived
in
town
over
-
night
in
the
stage
-
coach
from
Bath
,
and
entertained
him
with
such
a
ludicrous
account
of
his
fellow
-
travellers
,
that
Peregrine
,
for
the
first
time
since
their
parting
,
indulged
himself
in
mirth
,
even
to
the
hazard
of
suffocation
.
    
<EOS>
This
relation
was
confined
to
a
curious
dialogue
that
passed
betwixt
a
woollen
-
draper
and
his
wife
,
who
were
his
only
companions
during
the
best
part
of
the
journey
.
    
<EOS>
The
lady
laboured
under
a
Diabetes
,
in
consequence
of
having
used
the
waters
injudiciously
for
another
complaint
;
and
,
that
she
might
not
be
an
impediment
to
the
carriage
,
by
ordering
it
to
halt
,
as
often
as
she
should
have
occasion
to
disembogue
,
she
had
provided
herself
with
a
leathern
convenience
,
which
her
husband
carried
in
the
pocket
of
his
great
coat
,
conveying
it
privately
to
her
,
when
she
found
herself
necessitated
to
use
it
;
and
afterwards
,
taking
the
opportunity
to
empty
it
out
at
the
window
,
when
the
Misanthrope
's
head
chanced
to
be
turned
another
way
.
    
<EOS>
As
this
couple
embarked
with
Crabtree
,
in
the
full
persuasion
of
his
being
utterly
bereft
of
the
sense
of
hearing
,
they
kept
no
sort
of
reserve
in
their
conversation
;
and
at
last
fairly
quarrelled
,
on
account
of
the
good
man
's
want
of
alertness
,
in
handing
the
commodity
,
when
his
help
-
mate
's
occasions
were
so
extremely
pressing
,
that
her
flood
-
gates
gave
way
,
before
she
was
prepared
for
the
irruption
.
<EOS>
Smarting
with
this
disagreeable
circumstance
,
"
Odds
plague
!
<EOS>
you
nincompoop
,
(
cried
she
)
<EOS>
you
have
fumbled
so
long
about
the
pot
,
that
I
have
drenched
myself
all
over
.
<EOS>
I
wish
to
God
you
had
received
the
stream
in
your
mouth
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
thank
you
for
your
good
-
will
,
my
dear

(
answered
the
patient
husband
)
<EOS>
you
would
promote
me
to
the
honour
of
being
a
pissing
-
post
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
'm
sure
,
(
retorted
his
yoke
-
fellow
,
snatching
the
utensil
from
his
hand
)
<EOS>
you
are
fit
for
no
other
post
;
and
,
accordingly
,
suffer
yourself
to
be
piss'd
upon
by
every
body
.
<EOS>
Witness
your
pitiful
behaviour
at
the
E
O%
table
,
when
that
officer
bullied
you
out
of
twenty
guineas
,
which
you
wan't
obliged
to
pay
.
"
<EOS>
"
There
you
happen
to
be
wide
of
the
matter
,
(
said
the
draper
)
<EOS>
the
whole
company
gave
it
against
me
,
as
a
fair
bett
;
besides
,
the
captain
threatened
to
cut
my
throat
,
and
I
did
not
choose
to
give
him
that
trouble
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Cut
your
throat
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
virago
)
<EOS>
I
would
a
durst
;
you
had
a
good
action
against
him
for
putting
you
in
fear
of
your
life
.
<EOS>
But
you
are
a
poor
tool
,
good
for
nothing
but
squandering
away
my
money
.
<EOS>
If
you
had
possessed
spirit
enough
to
follow
my
advice
,
you
might
have
been
a
deputy
of
the
ward
,
by
this
time
.
<EOS>
But
,
all
your
care
is
to
sit
among
your
companions
of
the
garden
,
and
sing
bunting
-
songs
,
till
you
get
drunk
,
leaving
your
trade
at
sixes
and
sevens
,
and
your
family
to
go
to
the
dogs
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
husband
(
pacific
as
he
was
)
being
nettled
at
these
insinuations
,
frankly
told
her
,
that
his
affairs
had
never
prospered
,
since
she
had
persuaded
him
to
swear
a
book
-
debt
against
a
gentleman
's
executor
,
after
he
had
been
paid
by
the
deceased
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
her
eyes
lightened
with
fury
,
and
she
called
him
a
mean
-
spirited
sorry
fellow
,
for
upbraiding
her
,
a
weak
woman
,
with
what
she
had
done
for
his
own
good

Sirrah

said
she

<EOS>
I
suppose
you
would
be
base
enough
to
turn
evidence

if
you
thought
you
could
get
any

had
uttered

fine
children
,
that
must
be
allowed
;
but
,
whether
or
not
they
are
of
my
begetting
,
is
a
question
that
I
am
not
quite
so
clear
about
.
"
<EOS>
"
How
,
fellor
!
<EOS>
(
replied
the
wife
)
<EOS>
do
you
doubt
my
vartue
?
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
not
I
,
(
answered
the
shopkeeper
)
<EOS>
I
have
no
doubts
about
the
matter
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
a
long
time
since
surgeon
C
#
#
#
#
assured
me
,
that
he
would
suckle
upon
his
thumb
all
the
children
I
should
ever
beget
;
and
I
have
other
convincing
reasons
to
support
his
opinion
.
"
    
<EOS>
These
last
words
had
scarce
proceeded
from
his
mouth
,
when
his
sweet
-
blooded
spouse
,
leaving
her
duty
and
obedience
on
the
left
hand
,
and
forgetting
that
she
was
subject
to
the
eye
of
any
unconcerned
spectator
,
lifted
up
the
machine
she
had
just
replenished
,
and
made
such
application
with
it
to
the
forehead
of
her
husband
,
as
pressed
the
two
sides
of
it
together
,
by
which
means
,
the
contents
were
squirted
out
in
a
full
stream
,
that
played
upon
the
visage
of
the
astonished
Misanthrope
;
and
,
not
satisfied
with
the
vengeance
she
had
taken
,
she
quitted
her
weapon
,
and
assaulted
him
with
tooth
and
nail
,
exclaiming
all
the
time
,
"
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
pitiful
cuckoldy
scrub
,
have
you
the
impudence
to
own
to
my
face
,
that
you
married
a
woman
of
my
character
,
when
you
knew
your
own
infirmities
?
<EOS>
You
had
a
base
design
upon
my
fortune
,
you
slave
,
although
you
was
sensible
that
you
could
never
deserve
it
.
<EOS>
But
,
I
'll
be
revenged
of
you
,
if
there
be
a
man
to
be
had
for
love
or
money
.
"
    
<EOS>
Thus
,
far
from
attempting
to
clear
herself
from
the
imputation
implied
in
her
husband
's
words
,
she
construed
his
declaration
into
an
acknowledgment
of
the
ill
usage
she
had
suffered
;
and
while
she
trumpeted
her
own
wrongs
,
with
great
vociferation
,
exercised
her
claws
with
such
rancour
and
agility
,
that
the
poor
draper
was
fain
to
roar
aloud
for
assistance
;
and
as
Cadwallader
had
no
inclination
to
interpose
,
he
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
met
with
the
fate
of
Orpheus
,
had
not
his
cries
reached
the
ears
of
the
coachman
,
who
descended
from
his
box
,
and
partly
by
threats
,
and
partly
by
intreaties
,
put
an
end
to
her
operations
.

Chapter
LXXXVII
Crabtree
sounds
the
duchess
,
and
undeceives
Pickle
,
who
,
by
an
extraordinary
accident
,
becomes
acquainted
with
another
lady
of
quality
.
   
<EOS>
Crabtree
<EOS>
having
rehearsed
this
adventure
,
in
such
a
peculiarity
of
manner
,
as
added
infinite
ridicule
to
every
circumstance
,
and
repeated
every
scandalous
report
which
had
circulated
at
the
Bath
,
after
Peregrine
's
departure
,
was
informed
by
the
youth
,
that
he
harboured
a
design
upon
the
person
of
such
a
duchess
,
and
in
all
appearance
had
no
reason
to
complain
of
his
reception
;
but
,
that
he
would
not
venture
to
declare
himself
,
until
he
should
be
more
ascertained
of
her
sentiments
:
and
therefore
,
he
begg'd
leave
to
depend
upon
the
intelligence
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
who
,
he
knew
,
was
admitted
to
her
parties
.
    
<EOS>
The
Misanthrope
,
before
he
would
promise
his
assistance
,
asked
if
his
prospect
verged
towards
matrimony
?
<EOS>
and
our
adventurer
(
who
guessed
the
meaning
of
his
question
)
replying
in
the
negative
,
he
undertook
the
office
of
reconnoitring
her
inclination
,
protesting
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
would
never
concern
himself
in
any
scheme
<EOS>
,
that
did
not
tend
to
the
disgrace
and
deception
of
all
the
sex
.
    
<EOS>
On
these
conditions
,
he
espoused
the
interest
of
our
hero
,
and
a
plan
was
immediately
concerted
,
in
consequence
of
which
they
met
by
accident
at
her
grace
's
table
;
and
Pickle
having
stayed
all
the
fore
-
part
of
the
evening
,
and
sat
out
all
the
company
,
except
the
Misanthrope
and
a
certain
widow
-
lady
,
who
was
said
to
be
in
the
secrets
of
my
lady
duchess
,
went
away
,
on
pretence
of
an
indispensible
engagement
,
that
Crabtree
might
have
a
proper
opportunity
of
making
him
the
subject
of
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
he
had
scarce
quitted
the
apartment
,
when
this
Cynic
attending
him
to
the
door
,
with
a
look
of
morose
disdain
,
"
Were
I
an
absolute
prince
,
(
said
he
)
and
that
fellow
one
of
my
subjects
,
I
would
order
him
to
be
<EOS>
cloath'd
in
sack
-
cloth
,
and
he
should
drive
my
asses
to
water
,
that
his
lofty
spirit
might
be
lowered
to
the
level
of
his
deserts
.
<EOS>
The
pride
of
a
peacock
is
downright
self
-
denial
,
when
compared
with
the
vanity
of
that
coxcomb
,
which
was
naturally
arrogant
,
but
is
now
rendered
altogether
intolerable
,
by
the
reputation
he
acquired
at
Bath
,
or
kicking
a
bully
,
outwitting
a
club
of
raw
harpers
,
and
divers
other
pranks
,
in
the
execution
of
which
he
was
more
lucky
than
wise
.
<EOS>
But
nothing
has
contributed
so
much
to
the
increase
of
his
insolence
and
self
-
conceit
,
as
the
favour
he
found
among
the
ladies
.
<EOS>
Ay
,
the
ladies
,
Madam
,
I
care
not
who
knows
it
:
the
ladies
,
who
(
to
their
honour
be
it
spoken
)
never
fail
to
patronize
foppery
and
folly
,
provided
they
solicit
their
encouragement
.
    
<EOS>
And
yet
,
this
dog
was
not
on
the
footing
of
those
hermaphroditical
animals
,
who
may
be
reckoned
among
the
number
of
waiting
-
women
,
who
air
your
shifts
,
comb
your
lap
-
dogs
,
examine
your
noses
with
magnifying
glasses
,
in
order
to
squeeze
out
the
worms
,
clean
your
teeth
-
brushes
,
sweeten
your
handkerchiefs
,
and
soften
waste
paper
for
your
occasions
.
<EOS>
This
fellow
Pickle
was
entertained
for
more
important
purposes
;
his
turn
of
duty
never
came
till
all
those
lapwings
were
gone
to
roost
;
then
he
scaled
windows
,
leaped
over
garden
-
walls
,
and
was
let
in
by
Mrs
Betty
,
in
the
dark
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
the
magistrates
of
Bath
complimented
him
with
the
freedom
of
the
corporation
,
merely
because
,
through
his
means
,
the
waters
had
gained
extraordinary
credit
;
for
every
female
of
a
tolerable
appearance
,
that
went
thither
on
account
of
her
sterility
,
got
the
better
of
her
complaint
,
during
his
residence
at
the
Bath
:
and
now
,
the
fellow
thinks
no
woman
can
withstand
his
addresses
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
been
here
three
minutes
,
when
I
could
perceive
with
half
an
eye
,
that
he
had
marked
out
your
grace
for
a
conquest
;
I
mean
in
an
honourable
way
;
though
the
rascal
has
impudence
enough
to
attempt
any
thing
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
fixed
his
eyes
upon
the
duchess
,
who
(
while
her
face
glowed
with
indignation
)
turning
to
her
confidant
,
expressed
herself
in
these
words
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
believe
there
is
actually
some
truth
in
what
this
old
ruffian
says
;
I
have
myself
observed
that
young
fellow
eying
me
with
a
very
particular
stare
.
"
<EOS>
"
It
is
not
to
be
at
all
wondered
at
,
(
said
her
friend
)
that
a
youth
of
his
complexion
should
be
sensible
to
the
charms
of
your
grace
;
but
I
dare
say
,
he
would
not
presume
to
entertain
any
,
but
the
most
honourable
and
respectful
sentiments
.
"
<EOS>
"
Respectful
sentiments
!
<EOS>
(
cried
my
lady
,
with
a
look
of
ineffable
disdain
)
if
I
thought
the
fellow
had
assurance
enough
to
think
of
me
in
any
shape
,
I
protest
I
would
forbid
him
my
house
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
my
honour
,
such
instances
of
audacity
should
induce
persons
of
quality
to
keep
your
small
gentry
at
a
greater
distance
;
for
they
are
very
apt
to
grow
impudent
,
upon
the
least
countenance
or
encouragement
.
"
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
changed
the
subject
of
discourse
,
and
next
day
communicated
his
discovery
to
his
friend
Pickle
,
who
,
upon
this
occasion
,
felt
the
most
stinging
sensations
of
mortifying
pride
,
and
resolved
to
quit
his
prospect
with
a
good
grace
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
execution
of
this
self
-
denying
scheme
cost
him
one
moment
's
uneasiness
;
for
his
heart
had
never
been
interested
in
the
pursuit
,
and
his
vanity
triumphed
in
the
thoughts
of
manifesting
his
indifference
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
very
next
time
he
visited
her
grace
,
his
behaviour
was
remarkably
frank
,
sprightly
,
and
disengaged
;
and
the
subject
of
love
being
artfully
introduced
by
the
widow
,
who
had
been
directed
to
sound
his
inclinations
,
he
rallied
the
passion
with
great
ease
and
severity
,
and
made
no
scruple
of
declaring
himself
heartwhole
.
    
<EOS>
Though
the
duchess
had
resented
his
supposed
affection
,
she
was
now
offended
at
his
insensibility
,
and
even
signified
her
disgust
,
by
observing
,
that
perhaps
his
attention
to
his
own
qualifications
screened
him
from
the
impression
of
all
other
objects
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
enjoyed
this
sarcasm
,
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
which
he
could
plainly
discern
,
the
company
was
joined
by
a
certain
virtuoso
,
who
had
gained
free
access
to
all
the
great
families
of
the
land
,
by
his
notable
talent
of
gossiping
and
buffoonery
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
now
in
the
seventy
-
fifth
year
of
his
age
;
his
birth
was
so
obscure
,
that
he
scarce
knew
his
father
's
name
,
his
education
suitable
to
the
dignity
of
his
descent
,
his
character
publickly
branded
with
homicide
,
profligacy
,
and
breach
of
trust
;
yet
this
man
,
by
the
happy
inheritance
of
impregnable
effrontery
,
and
a
lucky
prostitution
of
all
principle
,
in
rendering
himself
subservient
to
the
appetites
of
the
great
,
had
attained
to
an
independency
of
fortune
,
as
well
as
to
such
a
particular
share
of
favour
among
the
quality
,
that
although
he
was
well
known
to
have
pimped
for
three
generations
of
the
nobility
,
there
was
not
a
lady
of
fashion
in
the
kingdom
,
who
scrupled
to
admit
him
to
her
toilette
,
or
even
to
be
squired
by
him
,
in
any
public
place
of
entertainment
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
this
sage
was
occasionally
useful
to
his
fellow
-
creatures
,
by
these
connexions
with
people
of
fortune
;
for
,
he
often
undertook
to
solicite
charity
in
behalf
of
distressed
objects
,
with
a
view
of
embezzling
one
half
of
the
benefactions
.
<EOS>
It
was
an
errand
of
this
kind
that
now
brought
him
to
the
house
of
her
grace
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
sat
a
few
minutes
,
he
told
the
company
,
that
he
would
favour
them
with
a
very
proper
opportunity
to
extend
their
benevolence
,
for
the
relief
of
a
poor
gentlewoman
,
who
was
reduced
to
the
most
abject
misery
,
by
the
death
of
her
husband
,
and
just
delivered
of
a
couple
of
fine
boys
.
    
<EOS>
They
,
moreover
,
understood
from
his
information
,
that
this
object
was
daughter
of
a
good
family
,
who
had
renounced
her
,
in
consequence
of
her
marrying
an
ensign
without
a
fortune
;
and
even
obstructed
his
promotion
with
all
their
influence
and
power
;
a
circumstance
of
barbarity
,
which
had
made
such
an
impression
upon
his
mind
,
as
disordered
his
brain
,
and
drove
him
to
despair
,
in
a
fit
of
which
he
had
made
away
with
himself
,
leaving
his
wife
then
big
with
child
,
to
all
the
horrors
of
indigence
and
grief
.
    
<EOS>
Various
were
the
criticisms
on
this
pathetic
picture
,
which
the
old
man
drew
with
great
expression
.
<EOS>
My
lady
duchess
concluded
,
that
she
must
be
a
creature
void
of
all
feeling
and
reflection
,
who
could
survive
such
aggravated
misery
;
therefore
,
did
not
deserve
to
be
relieved
,
except
in
the
character
of
a
common
beggar
;
and
was
generous
enough
to
offer
a
recommendation
,
by
which
she
would
be
admitted
into
an
infirmary
,
to
which
her
grace
was
a
subscriber
;
at
the
same
time
,
advising
the
sollicitor
to
send
the
twins
to
the
Foundling
-
hospital
,
where
they
would
be
carefully
nursed
and
brought
up
,
so
as
to
become
useful
members
of
the
commonwealth
.
<EOS>
Another
lady
,
with
all
due
deference
to
the
opinion
of
the
duchess
,
was
free
enough
to
blame
the
generosity
of
her
grace
,
which
would
only
serve
to
encourage
children
in
their
disobedience
to
their
parents
,
and
might
be
the
means
not
only
of
prolonging
the
distress
of
the
wretched
creature
,
but
also
of
ruining
the
constitution
of
some
young
heir
,
perhaps
the
hope
of
a
great
family
;
for
,
she
did
suppose
that
madam
,
when
her
month
should
be
up
,
and
her
brats
disposed
of
,
would
spread
her
attractions
to
the
public
,
(
provided
she
could
profit
by
her
person
)
and
,
in
the
usual
way
,
make
a
regular
progress
from
St
James
's
to
Drury
-
lane
.
<EOS>
She
apprehended
,
for
these
reasons
,
that
their
compassion
would
be
most
effectually
shewn
,
in
leaving
her
to
perish
in
her
present
necessity
;
and
that
the
old
gentleman
would
be
unpardonable
,
should
he
persist
in
his
endeavours
to
relieve
her
.
    
<EOS>
A
third
member
of
this
tender
-
hearted
society
,
after
having
asked
if
the
young
woman
was
handsome
?
and
been
answered
in
the
negative
,
allowed
,
that
there
was
a
great
deal
of
reason
in
what
had
been
said
by
the
honourable
person
who
had
spoke
last
nevertheless
,
she
humbly
conceived
,
her
sentence
would
admit
of
some
mitigation
.
"
<EOS>
Let
the
bantlings
(
said
she
)
be
sent
to
the
hospital
,
according
to
the
advice
of
her
grace
,
and
a
small
collection
be
made
for
the
present
support
of
the
mother
;
and
when
her
health
is
recovered
,
I
will
take
her
into
my
family
,
in
quality
of
an
upper
-
servant
,
or
medium
between
me
and
my
woman
;
for
,
upon
my
life
!
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
endure
to
chide
,
or
give
directions
to
a
creature
,
who
is
in
point
of
birth
and
education
,
but
one
degree
above
the
vulgar
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
This
proposal
met
with
universal
approbation
.
<EOS>
The
duchess
(
to
her
immortal
honour
)
began
the
contribution
with
a
crown
;
so
that
the
rest
of
the
company
were
obliged
to
restrict
their
liberality
to
half
the
sum
,
that
her
grace
might
not
be
affronted
;
and
the
proposer
demanding
the
poor
woman
's
name
and
place
of
abode
,
the
old
mediator
could
not
help
giving
her
ladyship
verbal
direction
,
though
he
was
extremely
mortified
(
on
more
accounts
than
one
)
to
find
such
an
issue
to
his
solicitation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
,
though
humorous
as
winter
had
a
tear
for
pity
,
and
an
hand
open
as
day
for
melting
charity
,
was
shocked
at
the
nature
and
result
of
this
ungenerous
consultation
.
<EOS>
He
contributed
his
half
-
crown
,
however
;
and
retiring
from
the
company
,
betook
himself
to
the
lodging
of
the
forlorn
lady
in
the
straw
,
according
to
the
direction
he
had
heard
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
inquiry
,
he
understood
,
that
she
was
then
visited
by
some
charitable
gentlewoman
,
who
had
sent
for
a
nurse
,
and
waited
the
return
of
the
messenger
;
and
he
sent
up
his
respects
,
desiring
he
might
be
permitted
to
see
her
,
on
pretence
of
having
been
intimate
with
her
late
husband
.
    
<EOS>
Though
the
poor
woman
had
never
heard
of
his
name
,
she
did
not
think
proper
to
deny
his
request
;
and
he
was
conducted
to
a
paultry
chamber
in
the
third
story
,
where
he
found
this
unhappy
widow
sitting
up
in
a
truckle
-
bed
,
and
suckling
one
of
her
infants
,
with
the
most
piteous
expression
of
anguish
in
her
features
,
which
were
naturally
regular
and
sweet
,
while
the
other
was
fondled
on
the
knee
of
a
person
,
whose
attention
was
so
much
ingrossed
by
her
little
charge
,
that
for
the
present
she
could
mind
nothing
else
:
and
it
was
not
till
after
the
first
compliments
passed
betwixt
<EOS>
the
hapless
mother
and
our
adventurer
,
that
he
perceived
the
stranger
's
countenance
,
which
inspired
him
with
the
highest
esteem
and
admiration
.
<EOS>
He
beheld
all
the
graces
of
elegance
and
beauty
,
breathing
sentiment
and
beneficence
,
and
softened
into
the
most
inchanting
tenderness
of
weeping
sympathy
:
and
when
he
declared
the
cause
of
his
visit
,
which
was
no
other
than
the
desire
of
befriending
the
distressed
lady
,
to
whom
he
presented
a
bank
-
note
for
twenty
pounds
,
he
was
favoured
with
such
a
look
of
complacency
by
this
amiable
phantom
,
who
might
have
been
justly
taken
for
an
angel
ministering
to
the
necessities
of
mortals
,
that
his
whole
soul
was
transported
with
love
and
veneration
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
prepossession
diminished
by
the
information
of
the
widow
,
who
,
after
having
manifested
her
gratitude
in
a
flood
of
tears
,
told
him
,
that
the
unknown
object
of
his
esteem
was
a
person
of
honour
,
who
having
heard
by
accident
of
her
deplorable
situation
,
had
immediately
obeyed
the
dictates
of
her
humanity
,
and
come
in
person
to
relieve
her
distress
;
that
she
had
not
only
generously
supplied
her
with
money
for
present
sustenance
,
but
also
undertaken
to
provide
a
nurse
for
her
babes
,
and
even
promised
to
favour
her
with
protection
<EOS>
,
should
she
survive
her
present
melancholy
situation
.
<EOS>
To
these
articles
of
intelligence
she
added
,
that
the
name
of
her
benefactress
was
the
celebrated
lady
 
,
to
whose
character
the
youth
was
no
stranger
,
though
he
had
never
seen
her
person
before
.
<EOS>
The
killing
edge
of
her
charms
was
a
little
blunted
by
the
accidents
of
time
and
fortune
;
but
no
man
of
taste
and
imagination
,
whose
nerves
were
not
quite
chilled
with
the
frost
of
age
,
could
,
even
at
that
time
look
upon
her
with
impunity
:
<EOS>
and
as
Peregrine
saw
her
attractions
heightened
by
the
tender
office
in
which
she
was
engaged
,
he
was
smitten
with
her
beauty
,
and
so
ravished
with
her
compassion
,
that
he
could
not
suppress
his
emotions
,
but
applauded
her
benevolence
with
all
the
warmth
of
enthusiasm
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
received
his
compliments
with
great
politeness
and
affability
;
and
the
occasion
on
which
they
met
being
equally
interesting
to
both
,
and
acquaintance
commenced
between
them
and
they
concerted
measures
for
the
benefit
of
the
widow
and
her
two
children
,
one
of
whom
our
hero
bespoke
for
his
own
godson
;
for
Pickle
was
not
so
obscure
in
the
beau
monde
,
but
that
his
fame
had
reached
the
ears
of
this
lady
,
who
therefore
,
did
not
discourage
his
advances
toward
her
friendship
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
All
the
particulars
relating
to
their
charge
being
adjusted
,
he
attended
her
ladyship
to
her
own
house
;
and
,
by
her
conversation
,
had
the
pleasure
of
finding
her
understanding
suitable
to
her
other
accomplishments
.
<EOS>
Nor
had
she
any
reason
to
think
,
that
our
hero
's
qualifications
had
been
exaggerated
by
common
report
.
    
<EOS>
One
of
their
adopted
children
died
before
it
was
baptized
;
so
that
their
care
concentered
in
the
other
,
for
whom
they
stood
sponsors
;
and
understanding
that
the
old
agent
was
become
troublesome
in
his
visits
to
the
mother
,
to
whom
he
now
began
to
administer
such
counsel
as
shocked
the
delicacy
of
her
virtue
,
they
removed
her
into
another
lodging
,
where
she
would
not
be
exposed
to
his
machinations
;
and
in
less
than
a
month
,
our
hero
learn'd
from
a
nobleman
of
his
acquaintance
,
that
the
hoary
pandar
had
actually
engaged
to
procure
for
him
,
this
poor
afflicted
gentlewoman
;
and
being
frustrated
in
his
intention
,
substituted
in
her
room
a
nymph
from
the
purlieus
of
Covent
-
garden
,
that
made
his
lordship
smart
severely
for
the
favours
she
bestowed
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Peregrine
cultivated
his
new
acquaintance
with
all
his
art
and
assiduity
,
presuming
,
from
the
circumstance
of
her
reputation
and
fate
,
as
well
as
on
the
strength
of
his
own
merit
,
that
,
in
time
,
he
should
be
able
to
indulge
that
passion
which
had
begun
to
glow
within
his
breast
.
    
<EOS>
As
her
ladyship
had
undergone
a
vast
variety
of
fortune
and
adventure
,
which
he
had
heard
instinctly
related
,
with
numberless
errors
and
mispresentations
,
he
was
no
sooner
intitled
,
by
the
familiarity
of
communication
,
to
ask
such
a
favour
,
than
he
earnestly
intreated
her
to
entertain
him
with
the
particulars
of
her
story
;
and
,
by
dint
of
importunity
<EOS>
,
she
was
at
length
prevailed
upon
(
in
a
select
partie
)
to
gratify
his
curiosity
in
these
words
.

Chapter
LXXXVIII
<EOS>
The
memoirs
of
a
lady
of
quality
.
   
<EOS>
By
the
circumstances
of
the
story
which
I
am
going
to
relate
,
you
will
be
convinced
of
my
candour
,
while
you
are
informed
of
my
indiscretion
;
and
be
enabled
,
I
hope
,
to
perceive
,
that
howsoever
<EOS>
my
head
may
have
erred
,
my
heart
hath
always
been
uncorrupted
,
and
that
I
have
been
unhappy
,
because
I
loved
,
and
was
a
woman
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
I
need
not
observe
,
that
I
was
the
only
child
of
a
man
of
good
fortune
,
who
indulged
me
,
in
my
infancy
,
with
all
the
tenderness
of
paternal
affection
;
and
when
I
was
six
years
old
,
sent
me
to
a
private
school
,
where
I
stayed
till
my
age
was
doubled
,
and
became
such
a
favourite
,
that
I
was
(
even
in
those
early
days
)
<EOS>
carried
to
all
the
places
of
public
diversion
,
the
court
itself
not
excepted
;
an
indulgence
that
flattered
my
love
of
pleasure
,
to
which
I
was
naturally
addicted
,
and
encouraged
those
ideas
of
vanity
and
ambition
,
which
spring
up
so
early
in
the
human
mind
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
lively
and
good
-
natured
,
my
imagination
apt
to
run
riot
,
my
heart
liberal
and
disinterested
;
though
I
was
so
obstinately
attached
to
my
own
opinions
,
that
I
could
not
well
brook
contradiction
;
and
in
the
whole
of
my
disposition
,
resembled
that
of
Henry
the
fifth
,
as
described
by
Shakespear
.
    
<EOS>
In
my
thirteenth
year
I
went
to
Bath
,
where
I
was
first
introduced
into
the
world
as
a
woman
,
having
been
intitled
to
that
privilege
by
my
person
,
which
was
remarkably
tall
for
my
years
;
and
there
my
fancy
was
quite
captivated
by
the
variety
of
diversions
in
which
I
was
continually
engaged
:
not
that
the
parties
were
altogether
new
to
me
,
but
because
I
now
found
myself
considered
as
a
person
of
consequence
,
and
surrounded
by
a
croud
of
admirers
,
who
courted
my
acquaintance
,
and
fed
my
vanity
with
praise
and
adulation
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
whether
or
not
I
deserved
their
encomiums
,
I
leave
the
world
to
judge
;
but
my
person
was
commended
,
and
my
talent
in
dancing
met
with
universal
applause
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
,
that
every
thing
appeared
joyous
to
a
young
creature
,
who
was
so
void
of
experience
and
dissimulation
,
that
she
believed
every
body
's
heart
as
sincere
as
her
own
,
and
every
object
such
as
it
appeared
to
be
.
    
<EOS>
Among
the
swains
who
sighed
,
or
pretended
to
sigh
for
me
,
were
two
that
bore
a
pretty
equal
share
of
my
favour
;
(
it
was
too
superficial
to
deserve
the
name
of
love
.
)
<EOS>
One
of
these
was
a
forward
youth
of
sixteen
,
extremely
handsome
,
lively
,
and
impudent
,
who
attended
in
quality
of
page
upon
the
princess
Amelia
,
who
spent
that
season
at
the
Bath
;
the
other
was
a
Scotch
nobleman
turned
of
thirty
,
who
was
graced
with
a
red
ribbon
,
and
danced
particularly
well
,
two
qualifications
of
great
weight
with
a
girl
of
my
age
,
whose
heart
was
not
deeply
interested
in
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
the
page
prevailed
over
this
formidable
rival
;
though
our
amour
went
no
farther
than
a
little
flirting
,
and
ceased
intirely
when
I
left
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
Next
year
,
however
,
I
revisited
this
agreeable
scene
,
and
passed
my
time
in
the
same
circle
of
amusements
;
in
which
,
indeed
,
each
season
at
Bath
is
exactly
resembled
by
that
which
succeeds
,
allowing
for
the
difference
of
company
,
which
is
continually
varying
.
<EOS>
There
I
met
with
the
same
incense
,
and
again
had
my
favourite
,
who
was
a
North
Briton
,
and
captain
of
foot
,
near
forty
years
of
age
,
and
a
little
lame
,
an
impediment
which
I
did
not
discover
,
until
it
was
pointed
out
by
some
of
my
companions
,
who
rallied
me
upon
my
choice
.
<EOS>
He
was
always
chearful
,
and
very
amorous
,
had
a
good
countenance
and
an
excellent
understanding
,
possessed
a
great
deal
of
art
,
and
would
have
persuaded
me
to
marry
him
,
had
I
not
been
restrained
by
the
authority
of
my
father
,
whose
consent
was
not
to
be
obtained
in
favour
of
a
man
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
many
proposals
of
marriage
were
made
to
my
parents
;
but
,
as
they
came
from
people
whom
I
did
not
like
,
I
rejected
them
all
,
being
determined
to
refuse
every
man
who
did
not
make
his
addresses
to
myself
in
person
,
because
I
had
no
notion
of
marrying
for
any
thing
but
love
.
    
<EOS>
Among
these
formal
proposers
was
a
Scottish
earl
,
whose
pretensions
were
broke
off
by
some
difference
about
settlements
;
and
the
son
of
an
English
baron
,
with
whom
my
father
was
in
treaty
,
when
he
carried
me
to
town
,
on
a
visit
to
a
young
lady
,
with
whom
I
had
been
intimate
from
my
infancy
.
    
<EOS>
She
was
just
delivered
of
her
first
son
,
for
whom
we
stood
sponsors
;
so
that
this
occasion
detained
us
a
whole
month
,
<EOS>
during
which
,
I
went
to
a
ball
at
court
on
the
queen
's
birth
-
day
,
and
there
,
for
the
first
time
,
felt
what
love
and
beauty
were
.
    
<EOS>
The
second
son
of
duke
 
,
who
had
just
returned
from
his
travels
,
was
dancing
with
the
princess
royal
,
when
a
young
lady
came
and
desired
me
to
go
and
see
a
stranger
,
whom
all
the
world
admired
:
upon
which
,
I
followed
her
into
the
circle
,
and
observed
this
object
of
admiration
.
<EOS>
He
was
dressed
in
a
coat
of
white
cloth
,
faced
with
blue
sattin
embroidered
with
silver
,
of
the
same
piece
with
his
waistcoat
;
his
fine
hair
hung
down
his
back
in
ringlets
below
his
waist
,
and
his
hat
was
laced
with
silver
,
and
garnished
with
a
white
feather
;
but
his
person
beggared
all
description
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
and
graceful
,
neither
corpulent
nor
meagre
,
his
limbs
finely
proportioned
,
his
countenance
open
and
majestic
,
his
eyes
full
of
sweetness
and
vivacity
,
his
teeth
regular
,
and
his
pouting
lips
of
the
complexion
of
the
damask
rose
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
was
formed
for
love
,
and
inspired
it
wherever
he
appeared
;
nor
was
he
a
niggard
of
his
talents
,
but
liberally
returned
it
;
at
least
what
passed
for
such
:
for
he
had
a
flow
of
gallantry
,
for
which
many
ladies
of
this
land
can
vouch
from
their
own
experience
:
but
he
exclaimed
against
marriage
,
because
he
had
,
as
yet
,
met
with
no
woman
,
to
whose
charms
he
would
surrender
his
liberty
,
though
a
princess
of
France
,
and
a
lady
of
the
same
rank
in
 
,
were
said
to
be
,
at
that
time
,
enamoured
of
his
person
.
    
<EOS>
I
went
home
,
totally
ingrossed
by
his
idea
,
flattering
myself
,
that
he
had
observed
me
with
some
attention
;
for
I
was
young
and
new
,
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
attract
the
notice
and
approbation
of
the
queen
herself
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
being
at
the
opera
,
I
was
agreeably
surprised
with
the
appearance
of
this
amiable
stranger
,
who
no
sooner
saw
me
enter
,
than
he
approached
so
near
to
the
place
where
I
sat
,
that
I
overheard
what
he
said
to
his
companions
;
and
was
so
happy
as
to
find
myself
the
subject
of
his
discourse
,
which
abounded
with
rapturous
expressions
of
love
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
listen
to
these
transports
without
emotion
;
my
colour
changed
,
my
heart
throbbed
with
unusual
violence
,
and
mine
eyes
betrayed
my
inclinations
in
sundry
favourable
glances
,
which
he
seemed
to
interpret
aright
,
though
he
could
not
then
avail
himself
of
his
success
,
so
far
as
to
communicate
his
sentiments
by
speech
,
because
we
were
strangers
to
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
I
passed
that
night
in
the
most
anxious
suspence
,
and
several
days
elapsed
,
before
I
saw
him
again
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
being
at
court
on
a
ballnight
,
and
determined
against
dancing
,
I
perceived
him
among
the
croud
,
and
,
to
my
unspeakable
joy
,
saw
him
advance
with
my
lord
P
#
#
#
#
,
who
introduced
him
to
my
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
soon
found
means
to
alter
my
resolution
;
and
I
condescended
to
be
his
partner
all
the
evening
;
during
which
,
he
declared
his
passion
in
the
most
tender
and
persuasive
terms
that
real
love
could
dictate
,
or
fruitful
imagination
invent
.
    
<EOS>
I
believed
his
protestations
,
because
I
wished
them
true
,
and
was
an
unexperienced
girl
of
fifteen
.
    
<EOS>
I
complied
with
his
earnest
request
of
being
permitted
to
visit
me
,
and
even
invited
him
to
breakfast
next
morning
;
so
that
you
may
imagine
<EOS>
(
I
speak
to
those
that
feel
)
<EOS>
I
did
not
,
that
night
,
enjoy
much
repose
.
<EOS>
Such
was
the
hurry
and
flutter
of
my
spirits
,
that
I
rose
at
six
to
receive
him
at
ten
.
<EOS>
I
dressed
myself
in
a
new
pink
sattin
-
gown
and
my
best
laced
night
-
cloaths
,
and
was
so
animated
by
the
occasion
,
that
if
ever
I
deserved
a
compliment
upon
my
looks
,
it
was
my
due
at
this
meeting
.
    
<EOS>
The
wished
-
for
moment
came
,
that
brought
my
lover
to
my
view
<EOS>
:
I
was
overwhelmed
with
joy
,
modesty
,
and
fear
of
<EOS>
I
knew
not
what
.
<EOS>
We
sat
down
to
breakfast
,
but
did
not
eat
.
<EOS>
He
renewed
his
addresses
with
irresistible
eloquence
,
and
pressed
me
to
accept
of
his
hand
,
without
farther
hesitation
:
<EOS>
but
,
to
such
a
precipitate
step
,
I
objected
,
as
a
measure
repugnant
to
decency
,
as
well
as
to
that
duty
which
I
owed
to
my
father
,
whom
I
tenderly
loved
.
    
<EOS>
Though
I
withstood
this
premature
proposal
,
I
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
situation
of
my
thoughts
;
and
thus
commenced
a
tender
correspondence
,
which
was
maintained
by
letters
while
I
remained
in
the
country
,
and
carried
on
(
when
I
was
in
town
)
by
private
interviews
,
twice
or
thrice
a
week
,
at
the
house
of
my
milliner
,
where
such
endearments
passed
as
refined
and
happy
lovers
know
,
and
others
can
only
guess
.
<EOS>
Truth
and
innocence
prevailed
on
my
side
,
while
his
heart
was
fraught
with
sincerity
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
Such
frequent
intercourse
created
an
intimacy
which
I
began
to
think
dangerous
,
and
therefore
yielded
to
his
repeated
desire
,
that
we
might
be
united
for
ever
:
<EOS>
nay
,
I
resolved
to
avoid
him
,
until
the
day
should
be
fixed
,
and
very
innocently
(
though
not
very
wisely
)
told
him
my
reason
for
this
determination
,
which
was
no
other
than
a
consciousness
of
my
incapacity
to
refuse
him
any
thing
he
should
demand
as
a
testimony
of
my
love
.
    
<EOS>
The
time
was
accordingly
appointed
,
at
the
distance
of
a
few
days
,
during
which
I
intended
to
have
implored
my
father
's
consent
,
though
I
had
but
<EOS>
faint
hopes
of
obtaining
it
:
<EOS>
but
,
he
was
by
some
means
or
other
apprized
of
our
design
,
before
I
could
prevail
upon
myself
to
make
him
acquainted
with
our
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
had
danced
with
my
lover
at
the
Ridotto
on
the
preceding
evening
,
and
there
,
perhaps
,
our
eyes
betrayed
us
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
several
of
lord
W####m
's
relations
,
who
disapproved
of
the
match
,
came
up
and
rallied
him
on
his
passion
;
<EOS>
lord
S####k
in
particular
,
used
this
remarkable
expression
,
"
Nephew
,
as
much
love
as
you
please
,
but
no
matrimony
.
"
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
the
priest
being
prepared
,
and
the
bridegroom
waiting
for
me
at
the
appointed
place
,
in
all
the
transports
of
impatient
expectation
,
I
was
,
without
any
previous
warning
,
carried
into
the
country
by
my
father
,
who
took
no
notice
of
the
intelligence
he
had
received
,
but
decoyed
me
into
the
coach
,
on
pretence
of
taking
the
air
;
and
when
we
had
proceeded
as
far
as
Turnham
green
,
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
he
would
dine
in
that
place
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
no
remedy
:
I
was
obliged
to
bear
my
disappointment
,
though
with
an
aching
heart
,
and
followed
him
up
stairs
into
an
apartment
,
where
he
told
me
he
was
minutely
informed
of
my
matrimonial
scheme
.
    
<EOS>
I
did
not
attempt
to
disguise
the
truth
,
but
assured
him
,
while
the
tears
gushed
from
my
eyes
,
that
my
want
of
courage
alone
had
hindered
me
from
making
him
privy
to
my
passion
;
though
I
owned
,
I
should
have
married
lord
W####m
,
even
though
he
had
disapproved
of
my
choice
.
<EOS>
I
reminded
him
of
the
uneasy
life
I
led
at
home
,
and
frankly
acknowledged
,
that
I
loved
my
admirer
too
well
to
live
without
him
;
though
if
he
wou'd
favour
me
with
his
consent
,
I
would
defer
my
intention
,
and
punctually
observe
any
day
he
should
fix
for
our
nuptials
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
begged
he
would
permit
me
to
send
a
message
to
lord
W####m
,
who
was
waiting
in
expectation
of
my
coming
,
and
might
(
without
such
notice
)
imagine
I
was
playing
the
jilt
.
<EOS>
He
granted
this
last
request
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
I
sent
a
letter
to
my
lover
,
who
,
when
he
received
it
,
had
almost
fainted
away
,
believing
that
I
should
be
locked
up
in
the
country
,
and
snatched
for
ever
from
his
arms
.
<EOS>
Tortured
with
these
apprehensions
,
he
changed
cloaths
immediately
,
and
taking
horse
,
resolved
to
follow
me
whithersoever
<EOS>
we
should
go
.
    
<EOS>
After
dinner
,
we
proceeded
as
far
as
Brentford
,
where
we
lay
,
intending
to
be
at
my
father
's
country
-
house
next
night
;
and
my
admirer
putting
up
at
the
same
inn
,
practised
every
expedient
his
invention
could
suggest
,
to
procure
an
interview
;
but
all
his
endeavours
were
unsuccessful
,
because
I
,
who
little
dream'd
of
his
being
so
near
,
had
gone
to
bed
upon
our
first
arrival
,
overwhelmed
with
affliction
and
tears
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
morning
I
threw
myself
at
my
father
's
feet
,
and
conjured
him
by
all
the
ties
of
paternal
affection
,
to
indulge
me
with
an
opportunity
of
seeing
my
admirer
once
more
,
before
I
should
be
conveyed
from
his
wishes
.
    
<EOS>
The
melancholy
condition
in
which
I
preferred
this
supplication
,
melted
the
tender
heart
of
my
parent
,
who
yielded
to
my
solicitation
,
and
carried
me
back
to
town
,
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
,
who
had
watched
our
motions
,
and
arrived
at
his
own
lodgings
,
before
we
alighted
at
my
father
's
house
,
obeyed
my
summons
on
the
instant
,
and
appeared
before
me
like
an
angel
.
<EOS>
Our
faculties
were
,
for
some
minutes
,
suspended
by
a
conflict
of
grief
and
joy
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
I
recovered
the
use
of
speech
,
and
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
I
was
come
to
town
,
in
order
to
take
my
leave
of
him
,
by
the
permission
of
my
father
,
whom
I
had
promised
to
attend
into
the
country
next
day
,
before
he
would
consent
to
my
return
;
the
chief
cause
and
pretence
of
which
,
was
my
earnest
desire
to
convince
him
,
that
I
was
not
to
blame
for
the
disappointment
he
had
suffered
,
and
that
I
should
see
him
again
in
a
month
,
when
the
nuptial
knot
should
be
tied
in
spite
of
all
opposition
.
    
<EOS>
My
lover
,
who
was
better
acquainted
with
the
world
,
had
well
nigh
run
distracted
with
this
information
.
<EOS>
He
swore
he
would
not
leave
me
,
until
I
should
promise
to
meet
and
marry
him
next
day
;
or
,
if
I
refused
to
grant
that
request
,
he
would
immediately
leave
the
kingdom
,
to
which
he
would
never
more
return
;
and
before
his
departure
,
sacrifice
lord
S
#
#
#
#
B
#
#
#
#
,
son
to
the
duke
of
S
A
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
the
only
person
upon
earth
who
could
have
betrayed
us
to
my
father
,
because
he
alone
was
trusted
with
the
secret
of
our
intended
marriage
,
and
had
actually
undertaken
to
give
me
away
;
an
office
which
he
afterwards
declined
.
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
also
affirmed
,
that
my
father
decoyed
me
into
the
country
,
with
a
view
of
cooping
me
up
,
and
sequestering
me
intirely
from
his
view
and
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
In
vain
I
pleaded
my
father
's
well
-
known
tenderness
,
and
used
all
the
arguments
I
could
recollect
to
divert
him
from
his
revenge
upon
lord
H
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
He
was
deaf
to
all
my
representations
,
and
nothing
,
I
found
,
would
prevail
upon
him
to
suppress
his
resentment
,
but
a
positive
promise
to
comply
with
his
former
desire
.
<EOS>
I
told
him
,
I
would
hazard
every
thing
to
make
him
happy
;
but
could
not
,
with
any
regard
to
my
duty
,
take
such
a
step
,
without
the
knowledge
of
my
parent
;
or
,
if
I
were
so
inclined
,
it
would
be
impracticable
to
elude
his
vigilance
and
suspicion
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
employed
such
pathetic
remonstrances
,
and
retained
such
a
powerful
advocate
within
my
own
breast
,
that
before
we
parted
,
I
assured
him
,
my
whole
power
should
be
exerted
for
his
satisfaction
;
and
he
signified
his
resolution
of
sitting
up
all
night
,
in
expectation
of
seeing
me
at
his
lodgings
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
retired
,
than
I
went
into
the
next
room
,
and
desired
my
father
to
fix
a
day
for
the
marriage
;
in
which
case
,
I
would
chearfully
wait
upon
him
into
the
country
;
whereas
,
should
he
deny
my
request
,
on
pretence
of
staying
for
the
consent
of
my
lover
's
relations
,
which
was
very
uncertain
,
I
would
seize
the
first
opportunity
of
marrying
lord
W####m
,
cost
what
it
would
.
<EOS>
He
consented
to
the
match
,
but
would
not
appoint
a
day
for
the
ceremony
,
which
he
proposed
to
defer
until
all
parties
should
be
agreed
;
and
such
a
favourable
crisis
,
I
feared
,
would
never
happen
.
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
resolved
within
myself
to
gratify
my
lover
's
expectation
,
by
eloping
,
if
possible
,
that
very
night
;
though
the
execution
of
this
plan
was
extremely
difficult
,
because
my
father
was
upon
the
alarm
,
and
my
own
maid
,
who
was
my
bedfellow
,
altogether
in
his
interest
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
considerations
,
I
found
means
to
engage
one
of
the
house
-
maids
in
my
behalf
,
who
bespoke
an
hackney
-
coach
,
to
be
kept
in
waiting
all
night
;
and
to
bed
I
went
with
my
Abigail
,
whom
(
as
I
had
not
closed
an
eye
)
<EOS>
I
waked
about
five
in
the
morning
,
and
sent
to
pack
up
some
things
for
our
intended
journey
.
    
<EOS>
While
she
was
thus
employed
,
I
got
up
,
and
huddled
on
my
cloaths
,
standing
upon
my
pillow
,
lest
my
father
,
who
lay
in
the
chamber
below
,
should
hear
me
afoot
,
and
suspect
my
design
.
    
<EOS>
Having
dressed
myself
with
great
dispatch
and
disorder
,
I
flounced
down
stairs
,
stalking
as
heavily
as
I
could
tread
,
that
he
might
mistake
me
for
one
of
the
servants
;
and
my
confederate
opening
the
door
,
I
sallied
out
into
the
street
,
though
I
knew
not
which
way
to
turn
,
and
,
to
my
unspeakable
mortification
,
neither
coach
nor
chair
appeared
.
    
<EOS>
Having
travelled
on
foot
a
good
way
,
in
hope
of
finding
a
convenience
;
and
being
not
only
disappointed
in
that
particular
,
but
also
bewildered
in
my
peregrination
,
I
began
to
be
exceedingly
alarmed
with
the
apprehension
of
being
met
by
some
person
who
might
know
me
;
because
,
in
that
case
,
my
design
would
undoubtedly
have
been
discovered
,
from
every
circumstance
of
my
appearance
at
that
time
of
day
;
for
I
had
put
on
the
very
cloaths
which
I
had
pulled
off
over
night
,
so
that
my
dress
was
altogether
odd
and
peculiar
:
my
shoes
were
very
fine
,
and
over
a
large
hoop
<EOS>
I
wore
a
pink
sattin
quilted
petticoat
trimmed
with
silver
,
which
was
partly
covered
by
a
white
dimity
night
-
gown
,
a
full
quarter
of
a
yard
too
short
:
my
handkerchief
and
apron
were
hurried
on
without
pinning
;
my
night
-
cap
could
not
contain
my
hair
,
which
hung
about
my
ears
in
great
disorder
,
and
my
countenance
denoted
a
mixture
of
hope
and
fear
,
joy
and
shame
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
I
made
my
addresses
to
that
honourable
member
of
society
a
shoe
-
black
,
whom
I
earnestly
intreated
to
provide
me
with
a
coach
or
chair
,
promising
to
reward
him
liberally
for
his
trouble
:
but
he
having
the
misfortune
to
be
lame
,
was
unable
to
keep
up
with
my
pace
;
so
that
,
by
his
advice
and
direction
,
I
went
into
the
first
public
-
house
I
found
open
,
where
I
stayed
some
time
,
in
the
utmost
consternation
,
among
a
crew
of
wretches
whom
I
thought
proper
to
bribe
for
their
civility
,
not
without
the
terror
of
being
stripped
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
my
messenger
returned
with
a
chair
,
of
which
I
took
immediate
possession
;
and
fearing
that
,
by
this
time
,
my
family
would
be
alarmed
,
and
send
directly
to
lord
W####m
's
lodgings
,
I
ordered
myself
to
be
carried
thither
backwards
,
that
so
I
might
pass
undiscovered
.
    
<EOS>
This
stratagem
succeeded
according
to
my
wish
;
I
ran
up
stairs
,
in
a
state
of
trepidation
,
to
my
faithful
lover
,
who
called
an
hackneycoach
,
in
which
we
went
to
church
and
were
married
.
    
<EOS>
His
fears
were
then
all
over
,
but
mine
recurred
with
double
aggravation
:
    
<EOS>
I
dreaded
the
sight
of
my
father
,
and
shared
all
the
sorrow
he
suffered
on
account
of
my
undutiful
behaviour
:
for
I
loved
him
with
such
piety
of
affection
,
that
I
would
have
endured
every
other
species
of
distress
,
rather
than
have
given
him
the
least
uneasiness
:
but
love
(
where
he
reigns
in
full
empire
)
is
altogether
irresistible
,
surmounts
every
difficulty
,
and
swallows
up
all
other
considerations
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
case
with
me
;
and
now
the
irrevocable
step
was
taken
,
my
first
care
was
to
avoid
his
sight
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
I
begged
that
lord
W####m
would
think
of
some
remote
place
in
the
country
,
to
which
we
might
retire
for
the
present
;
and
he
forthwith
conducted
me
to
an
house
on
Blackheath
,
where
we
were
very
civilly
received
by
a
laughter
-
loving
dame
,
who
seemed
to
mistake
me
for
one
of
her
own
sisterhood
.
    
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
perceived
her
opinion
,
than
I
desired
lord
W####m
to
undeceive
her
;
upon
which
she
was
made
acquainted
with
the
predicament
in
which
I
stood
,
and
shewed
us
into
a
private
room
,
where
I
called
for
pen
and
paper
,
and
wrote
an
apology
to
my
father
,
for
having
acted
contrary
to
his
will
,
in
so
important
a
concern
.
    
<EOS>
This
task
being
performed
,
the
bridegroom
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
our
being
bedded
immediately
,
in
order
to
render
the
marriage
binding
,
lest
my
father
should
discover
and
part
us
before
consummation
.
<EOS>
I
pleaded
hard
for
a
respite
till
the
evening
,
objecting
to
the
indecency
of
going
to
bed
before
noon
;
but
he
found
means
to
invalidate
all
my
arguments
,
and
to
convince
me
,
that
it
was
now
my
duty
to
obey
.
    
<EOS>
Rather
than
hazard
the
imputation
of
being
obstinate
and
refractory
on
the
first
day
of
my
probation
,
I
suffered
myself
to
be
led
into
a
chamber
,
which
was
darkened
by
my
express
stipulation
,
that
my
shame
and
confusion
might
be
the
better
concealed
,
and
yielded
to
the
privilege
of
a
dear
husband
,
who
loved
me
to
adoration
.
    
<EOS>
About
five
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
we
were
called
to
dinner
,
which
we
had
ordered
to
be
ready
at
four
;
but
such
a
paultry
care
had
been
forgot
,
amidst
the
transports
of
our
mutual
bliss
.
<EOS>
We
got
up
,
however
,
and
when
we
came
down
stairs
,
I
was
ashamed
to
see
the
light
of
day
,
or
meet
the
eyes
of
my
beloved
lord
.
<EOS>
I
ate
little
,
said
less
,
was
happy
,
though
overwhelmed
with
confusion
,
underwent
a
thousand
agitations
,
some
of
which
were
painful
,
but
by
far
the
greater
part
belonged
to
rapture
and
delight
;
we
were
imparadised
in
the
gratification
of
our
mutual
wishes
,
and
felt
all
that
love
can
bestow
,
and
sensibility
enjoy
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
twilight
,
we
returned
to
lord
W####m
's
lodgings
in
town
,
where
I
received
a
letter
from
my
father
,
importing
,
that
he
would
never
see
me
again
.
<EOS>
But
there
was
one
circumstance
in
his
manner
of
writing
,
from
which
I
conceived
an
happy
presage
of
his
future
indulgence
.
<EOS>
He
had
begun
with
his
usual
appellation
of
Dear
Fanny
,
which
,
though
it
was
expunged
to
make
way
for
the
word
Madam
,
encouraged
me
to
hope
that
his
paternal
fondness
was
not
yet
extinguished
.
    
<EOS>
At
supper
,
we
were
visited
by
lord
W####m
's
youngest
sister
,
who
laughed
at
us
for
our
inconsiderate
match
,
though
,
she
owned
,
she
envied
our
happiness
,
and
offered
me
the
use
of
her
cloaths
,
until
I
could
retrieve
my
own
.
<EOS>
She
was
a
woman
of
a
great
deal
of
humour
,
plain
but
genteel
,
civil
,
friendly
,
and
perfectly
well
-
bred
.
<EOS>
She
favoured
us
with
her
company
till
the
night
was
pretty
far
advanced
,
and
did
not
take
her
leave
till
we
retired
to
our
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
As
our
lodgings
were
not
spacious
or
magnificent
,
we
resolved
to
see
little
company
;
but
this
resolution
was
frustrated
by
the
numerous
acquaintance
of
lord
W####m
,
who
let
in
half
the
town
;
so
that
I
ran
the
gauntlet
for
a
whole
week
among
a
set
of
wits
,
who
always
delight
in
teazing
a
young
creature
of
any
note
,
when
she
happens
to
make
such
a
stolen
match
.
<EOS>
Among
those
that
visited
us
upon
this
occasion
,
was
my
lord
's
younger
brother
,
who
was
at
that
time
in
keeping
with
a
rich
heiress
of
masculine
memory
,
and
took
that
opportunity
of
making
a
parade
with
his
equipage
,
which
was
indeed
very
magnificent
,
but
altogether
disregarded
by
us
,
whose
happiness
consisted
in
the
opulence
of
mutual
love
.
    
<EOS>
This
ceremony
of
receiving
visits
being
performed
,
we
went
to
wait
on
his
mother
the
duchess
of
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
hearing
I
was
an
heiress
,
readily
forgave
her
son
for
marrying
without
her
knowledge
and
consent
,
and
favoured
us
with
a
very
cordial
reception
;
insomuch
that
,
for
several
months
,
we
dined
almost
constantly
at
her
table
;
and
I
must
own
,
I
always
found
her
unaltered
in
her
civility
and
affection
,
contrary
to
her
general
character
,
which
was
haughty
and
capricious
.
<EOS>
She
was
undoubtedly
a
woman
of
great
spirit
and
understanding
,
but
subject
to
an
infirmity
which
very
much
impairs
and
disguises
every
other
qualification
.
    
<EOS>
In
about
three
weeks
after
our
marriage
,
I
was
so
happy
as
to
obtain
the
forgiveness
of
my
father
,
to
whose
house
we
repaired
,
in
order
to
pay
our
respects
and
submission
.
    
<EOS>
At
sight
of
me
he
wept
;
nor
did
I
behold
his
tears
unmoved
:
<EOS>
my
heart
was
over
-
charged
with
tenderness
and
sorrow
,
for
having
offended
such
an
indulgent
parent
;
so
that
I
mingled
my
tears
with
his
,
while
my
dear
husband
,
whose
soul
was
of
the
softest
and
gentlest
mould
,
melted
with
sympathy
at
the
affecting
scene
.
    
<EOS>
Being
thus
reconciled
to
my
father
,
we
attended
him
into
the
country
,
where
we
were
received
by
my
mother
,
who
was
a
sensible
good
woman
,
though
not
susceptible
of
love
,
and
therefore
less
apt
to
excuse
a
weakness
,
to
which
she
was
an
utter
stranger
.
<EOS>
This
was
likewise
the
case
with
an
uncle
,
from
whom
I
had
great
expectations
.
<EOS>
He
was
a
plain
good
-
natured
man
,
and
treated
us
with
great
courtesy
;
though
his
notions
,
in
point
of
love
,
were
not
exactly
conformable
to
ours
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
was
,
and
seemed
to
be
so
happy
in
my
choice
,
that
my
family
not
only
became
satisfied
with
the
match
,
but
exceedingly
fond
of
lord
W####m
.
    
<EOS>
After
a
short
stay
with
them
in
the
country
,
we
returned
to
London
,
in
order
to
be
introduced
at
court
,
and
then
set
out
for
the
North
,
on
a
visit
to
my
brother
-
in
-
law
the
duke
of
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
,
by
a
letter
to
lord
W####m
,
invited
us
to
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
My
father
accordingly
equipped
us
with
horses
and
money
;
for
our
own
finances
were
extremely
slender
,
consisting
only
of
a
small
pension
allowed
by
his
grace
,
upon
whom
the
brothers
were
intirely
dependent
,
the
father
having
died
suddenly
,
before
suitable
provision
could
be
made
for
his
younger
children
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
took
my
leave
of
my
relations
,
bidding
adieu
to
my
paternal
home
,
and
found
myself
launching
into
a
world
of
care
and
trouble
,
though
the
voyage
on
which
I
had
embarked
was
altogether
voluntary
,
and
my
companion
the
person
on
whom
I
doated
to
distraction
,
I
could
not
help
feeling
some
melancholy
sensations
,
which
,
however
,
in
a
little
time
,
gave
way
to
a
train
of
more
agreeable
ideas
.
<EOS>
I
was
visited
in
town
by
almost
all
the
women
of
fashion
,
many
of
whom
,
I
perceived
,
envied
me
the
possession
of
a
man
who
had
made
strange
havock
among
their
hearts
,
and
some
of
them
knew
the
value
of
his
favour
.
<EOS>
One
in
particular
endeavoured
to
cultivate
my
friendship
with
singular
marks
of
regard
;
but
I
thought
proper
to
discourage
her
advances
,
by
keeping
within
the
bounds
of
bare
civility
;
and
indeed
,
to
none
of
them
was
I
lavish
of
my
complaisance
;
for
I
dedicated
my
whole
time
to
the
object
of
my
affection
,
who
engrossed
my
wishes
to
such
a
degree
,
<EOS>
that
although
I
was
never
jealous
(
because
I
had
no
reason
to
be
so
)
I
envied
the
happiness
of
every
woman
whom
he
chanced
at
any
time
to
hand
into
a
coach
.
    
<EOS>
The
duchess
of
 
,
who
was
newly
married
to
the
earl
of
P
#
#
#
#
,
a
particular
friend
of
lord
W####m
's
,
carried
me
to
court
,
and
presented
me
to
the
queen
,
who
expressed
her
approbation
of
my
person
in
very
particular
terms
,
and
observed
the
satisfaction
that
appeared
in
my
countenance
with
marks
of
admiration
;
desiring
her
ladies
to
take
notice
,
how
little
happiness
depended
upon
wealth
,
since
there
was
more
joy
in
my
face
than
in
all
her
court
beside
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
declaration
could
not
fail
to
overwhelm
me
with
blushes
,
which
her
majesty
seemed
to
behold
with
pleasure
;
for
she
frequently
repeated
the
remark
,
and
shewed
me
to
all
the
foreigners
of
distinction
,
with
many
gracious
expressions
of
favour
.
    
<EOS>
She
wished
lord
W####m
happiness
instead
of
joy
,
and
was
pleased
to
promise
,
that
she
would
provide
for
her
pretty
beggars
:
and
poor
enough
we
certainly
were
in
every
article
but
love
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
we
felt
no
necessities
,
but
passed
the
summer
in
a
variety
of
pleasures
and
parties
,
the
greatest
part
of
which
were
planned
by
lord
W####m
's
sister
and
another
lady
,
who
was
at
that
time
mistress
to
the
prime
minister
.
<EOS>
The
first
was
a
wit
,
but
homely
in
her
person
;
the
other
,
a
woman
of
great
beauty
and
masculine
understanding
;
and
a
particular
friendship
subsisted
between
them
,
though
they
were
both
lovers
of
power
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
This
lady
,
who
sat
at
the
helm
,
was
extremely
elegant
as
well
as
expensive
in
her
diversions
,
in
many
of
which
we
bore
a
share
;
particularly
in
her
parties
upon
the
water
,
which
were
contrived
in
all
the
magnificence
of
taste
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
these
amusements
,
a
trifling
circumstance
occurred
,
which
I
shall
relate
as
an
instance
of
that
jealous
sensibility
which
characterised
lord
W
#
#
#
#
's
disposition
.
<EOS>
A
large
company
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
having
agreed
to
dine
at
Vauxhall
,
and
sup
at
Marblehall
,
where
we
proposed
to
conclude
the
evening
with
a
dance
,
one
barge
being
insufficient
to
contain
the
whole
company
,
we
were
divided
by
lots
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
my
husband
and
I
were
parted
.
<EOS>
This
separation
was
equally
mortifying
to
us
both
,
who
,
though
married
,
were
still
lovers
;
and
my
chagrin
was
increased
,
when
I
perceived
that
I
was
doomed
to
sit
by
Sir
W
#
#
#
#
Y
#
#
#
#
,
a
man
of
professed
gallantry
:
for
,
<EOS>
although
lord
W####m
had
,
before
his
marriage
,
made
his
addresses
to
every
woman
he
saw
,
I
knew
very
well
he
did
not
desire
that
any
person
should
make
love
to
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
That
I
might
not
therefore
give
umbrage
,
by
talking
to
this
gallant
<EOS>
,
I
conversed
with
a
Scotch
nobleman
,
who
,
according
to
common
report
,
had
formerly
sighed
among
my
admirers
:
by
these
means
,
in
seeking
to
avoid
one
error
,
I
unwittingly
plunged
myself
into
a
greater
;
and
disobliged
Lord
W####m
so
much
,
that
he
could
not
conceal
his
displeasure
;
nay
,
so
deeply
was
he
offended
at
my
conduct
,
that
in
the
evening
,
when
the
ball
began
,
he
would
scarce
deign
to
take
me
by
the
hand
in
the
course
of
dancing
,
and
darted
such
unkind
looks
as
pierced
me
to
the
very
soul
;
and
what
augmented
my
concern
,
was
my
ignorance
of
the
trespass
I
had
committed
.
<EOS>
I
was
tortured
with
a
thousand
uneasy
reflections
;
I
began
to
fear
that
I
had
mistaken
his
temper
,
and
given
my
heart
to
a
man
who
was
tired
of
possession
;
tho
'
I
resolved
to
bear
without
complaining
the
misfortune
I
had
entailed
upon
myself
.
    
<EOS>
I
seized
the
first
opportunity
of
speaking
to
him
,
and
thereby
discovered
the
cause
of
his
chagrin
;
<EOS>
but
,
as
there
was
no
time
for
expostulation
,
the
misunderstanding
continued
on
his
side
,
with
such
evident
marks
of
uneasiness
,
that
every
individual
of
the
company
made
up
to
me
,
and
inquired
about
the
cause
of
his
disorder
;
so
that
I
was
fain
to
amuse
their
concern
,
by
saying
that
he
had
been
ill
the
day
before
,
and
dancing
did
not
agree
with
his
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
So
much
was
he
incensed
by
this
unhappy
circumstance
of
my
conduct
,
which
was
void
of
all
intention
to
offend
him
,
that
he
determined
to
be
revenged
of
me
,
for
my
indiscretion
,
and
at
supper
,
chancing
to
sit
between
two
very
handsome
ladies
,
(
one
of
whom
is
lately
dead
,
and
the
other
,
at
present
,
my
neighbour
in
the
country
)
<EOS>
he
affected
an
air
of
gaiety
,
and
openly
coquetted
with
them
both
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
not
the
only
punishment
he
inflicted
on
his
innocent
wife
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
our
entertainment
,
we
engaged
in
some
simple
diversion
,
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
gentlemen
were
ordered
to
salute
the
ladies
;
when
Lord
W####m
,
in
performing
this
command
,
unkindly
neglected
me
in
my
turn
;
and
I
had
occasion
for
all
my
discretion
and
pride
,
to
conceal
from
the
company
the
agonies
I
felt
at
this
mark
of
indifference
and
disrespect
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
obtained
the
victory
over
myself
,
and
pretended
to
laugh
at
his
husband
-
like
behaviour
,
while
the
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
,
and
my
heart
swelled
even
to
bursting
.
    
<EOS>
We
broke
up
about
five
,
after
having
spent
the
most
tedious
evening
I
had
ever
known
;
and
this
offended
lover
went
to
bed
in
a
state
of
sullen
silence
and
disgust
.
<EOS>
Whatever
desire
I
had
to
come
to
an
explanation
<EOS>
,
I
thought
myself
so
much
aggrieved
by
his
unreasonable
prejudice
,
that
I
could
not
prevail
upon
myself
to
demand
a
conference
,
till
after
his
first
nap
,
when
my
pride
giving
way
to
my
tenderness
,
I
clasped
him
in
my
arms
,
though
he
pretended
to
discourage
these
advances
of
my
love
:
I
asked
how
he
could
be
so
unjust
as
to
take
umbrage
at
my
civility
to
a
man
whom
,
he
knew
,
I
had
refused
for
his
sake
.
    
<EOS>
I
chid
him
for
his
barbarous
endeavours
to
awake
my
jealousy
,
and
used
such
irresistible
arguments
in
my
own
vindication
,
that
he
was
convinced
of
my
innocence
,
sealed
my
acquittal
with
a
kind
embrace
,
and
we
mutually
enjoyed
the
soft
transports
of
a
fond
reconciliation
.
    
<EOS>
Never
was
passion
more
eager
,
delicate
,
or
unreserved
,
than
that
which
glowed
within
our
breasts
.
<EOS>
Far
from
being
cloyed
with
the
possession
of
each
other
,
our
raptures
seemed
to
increase
with
the
term
of
our
union
.
<EOS>
When
we
were
parted
,
though
but
for
a
few
hours
,
by
the
necessary
avocations
of
life
,
we
were
unhappy
during
that
brief
separation
,
and
met
again
,
like
lovers
who
knew
no
joy
but
in
one
another
's
presence
.
<EOS>
How
many
delicious
evenings
did
we
spend
together
,
in
our
own
little
apartment
,
after
we
had
ordered
the
candles
to
be
taken
away
,
that
we
might
enjoy
the
agreeable
reflection
of
the
moon
,
in
a
fine
summer
's
evening
.
<EOS>
Such
a
mild
and
solemn
scene
naturally
disposes
the
mind
to
peace
and
benevolence
;
but
when
improved
with
the
conversation
of
the
man
one
loves
,
it
fills
the
imagination
with
ideas
of
ineffable
delight
!
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
can
safely
say
,
my
heart
was
so
wholly
ingrossed
by
my
husband
,
that
I
never
took
pleasure
in
any
diversion
,
where
he
was
not
personally
concerned
;
nor
was
I
ever
guilty
of
one
thought
repugnant
to
my
duty
and
my
love
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
autumn
we
set
out
for
the
north
,
and
were
met
on
the
road
by
the
duke
and
twenty
gentlemen
,
who
conducted
us
to
H####n
,
where
we
lived
in
all
imaginable
splendor
.
<EOS>
His
grace
,
at
that
time
,
maintained
above
an
hundred
servants
,
with
a
band
of
music
,
which
always
performed
at
dinner
,
kept
open
table
,
and
was
visited
by
a
great
deal
of
company
.
    
<EOS>
The
oeconomy
of
his
house
was
superintended
by
his
eldest
sister
,
a
beautiful
young
lady
of
an
amiable
temper
,
with
whom
I
soon
contracted
an
intimate
friendship
.
<EOS>
She
and
the
duke
used
to
rally
me
upon
my
fondness
for
lord
W####m
,
who
was
a
sort
of
an
humourist
,
and
apt
to
be
in
a
pet
,
in
which
case
he
would
leave
the
company
,
and
go
to
bed
by
seven
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
<EOS>
On
these
occasions
I
always
disappeared
,
giving
up
every
consideration
to
that
of
pleasing
my
husband
,
notwithstanding
the
ridicule
of
his
relations
,
who
taxed
me
with
having
spoiled
him
with
too
much
indulgence
.
<EOS>
But
how
could
I
express
too
much
tenderness
and
condescension
for
a
man
,
who
doated
upon
me
to
such
excess
,
that
when
business
obliged
him
to
leave
me
,
he
always
snatched
the
first
opportunity
to
return
,
and
often
rode
through
darkness
,
storms
and
tempests
to
my
arms
.
    
<EOS>
Having
stayed
about
seven
months
in
this
place
,
I
found
myself
in
a
fair
way
of
being
a
mother
;
and
that
I
might
be
near
my
own
relations
,
in
such
an
interesting
situation
,
I
and
my
dear
companion
departed
from
H####n
,
not
without
great
reluctance
;
for
I
was
fond
of
the
Scots
in
general
,
who
treated
me
with
great
hospitality
and
respect
;
and
to
this
day
,
they
pay
me
the
compliment
of
saying
,
I
was
one
of
the
best
wives
in
that
country
,
which
is
so
justly
celebrated
for
good
women
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
having
attended
me
to
my
father
's
house
,
was
obliged
to
return
to
Scotland
,
to
support
his
interest
in
being
elected
member
of
parliament
;
so
that
he
took
his
leave
of
me
,
with
a
full
resolution
of
seeing
me
again
,
before
the
time
of
my
lying
-
inn
;
and
all
the
comfort
I
enjoyed
in
his
absence
,
was
the
perusal
of
his
letters
,
which
I
punctually
received
,
together
with
those
of
his
sister
,
who
,
from
time
to
time
,
favoured
me
with
assurances
of
his
constancy
and
devotion
.
<EOS>
Indeed
these
testimonials
were
necessary
to
one
of
my
disposition
;
for
I
was
none
of
those
who
could
be
contented
with
half
an
heart
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
even
spare
one
complacent
look
to
any
other
woman
,
but
expected
the
undivided
homage
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
Had
I
been
disappointed
in
this
expectation
,
I
should
(
though
a
wife
)
have
rebelled
or
died
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
my
parents
treated
me
with
great
tenderness
,
intending
that
lord
W####m
should
be
settled
in
a
house
of
his
own
,
and
accommodated
with
my
fortune
;
and
his
expectations
from
the
queen
were
very
sanguine
,
when
I
was
taken
ill
,
and
delivered
of
a
dead
child
:
an
event
which
affected
me
so
much
,
that
when
I
understood
the
extent
of
my
misfortune
,
my
heart
throbbed
with
such
violence
,
that
my
breast
could
scarce
contain
it
;
and
my
anxiety
being
aggravated
by
the
absence
of
my
lord
,
produced
a
dangerous
fever
,
of
which
he
was
no
sooner
apprized
by
letter
,
than
he
came
post
from
Scotland
;
but
before
his
arrival
,
I
was
supposed
to
be
in
a
fair
way
.
    
<EOS>
During
this
journey
,
he
was
tortured
with
all
that
terrible
suspence
which
prevails
in
the
minds
of
those
who
are
in
danger
of
losing
that
which
is
most
dear
to
them
;
and
when
he
entered
the
house
,
was
so
much
overwhelmed
with
apprehension
,
that
he
durst
not
inquire
about
the
state
of
my
health
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
my
part
,
I
never
closed
an
eye
from
the
time
on
which
I
expected
his
return
;
and
when
I
heard
his
voice
,
threw
open
my
curtains
,
and
sat
up
in
the
bed
to
receive
him
,
though
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
.
<EOS>
He
ran
towards
me
with
all
the
eagerness
of
passion
,
and
clasp'd
me
in
his
arms
;
he
kneeled
by
my
bed
-
side
,
kissed
my
hand
a
thousand
times
,
and
wept
with
transports
of
tenderness
and
joy
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
meeting
was
so
pathetic
,
as
to
overcome
my
enfeebled
constitution
;
and
we
were
parted
by
those
who
were
wiser
than
ourselves
,
and
saw
that
nothing
was
so
proper
for
us
as
a
little
repose
.
    
<EOS>
But
how
shall
I
relate
the
deplorable
transition
from
envied
happiness
to
excess
of
misery
,
which
I
now
sustained
!
<EOS>
My
month
was
hardly
up
,
when
my
dear
husband
was
taken
ill
:
perhaps
the
fatigue
of
body
as
well
as
mind
,
which
he
had
undergone
on
my
account
,
occasioned
a
fatal
ferment
in
his
blood
,
and
his
health
fell
a
sacrifice
to
his
love
.
<EOS>
Physicians
were
called
from
London
;
but
alas
!
<EOS>
they
brought
no
hopes
of
his
recovery
.
<EOS>
By
their
advice
,
he
was
removed
to
town
,
for
the
convenience
of
being
punctually
attended
.
<EOS>
Every
moment
was
too
precious
to
be
thrown
away
;
he
was
therefore
immediately
put
into
the
coach
,
though
the
day
was
far
spent
;
and
I
,
though
exceedingly
weak
,
accompanied
him
in
the
journey
,
which
was
performed
by
the
light
of
flambeaus
,
and
rendered
unspeakably
shocking
,
by
the
dismal
apprehension
of
losing
him
every
moment
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
we
arrived
at
our
lodgings
on
Pall
-
mall
,
where
I
lay
by
him
on
the
floor
,
and
attended
the
issue
of
his
distemper
,
in
all
the
agonies
of
horror
and
despair
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
his
malady
settled
upon
his
brain
,
and
in
his
delirium
,
he
uttered
such
dreadful
exclamations
,
as
were
sufficient
to
pierce
the
most
savage
heart
.
    
<EOS>
What
effect
then
must
they
have
had
on
mine
,
which
was
fraught
with
every
sentiment
of
the
most
melting
affection
!
<EOS>
It
was
not
a
common
grief
that
took
possession
of
my
soul
;
I
felt
all
the
aggravation
of
the
most
acute
distress
.
<EOS>
I
sometimes
ran
down
to
the
street
in
a
fit
of
distraction
:
I
sent
for
the
doctors
every
minute
:
I
wearied
heaven
with
my
prayers
;
even
now
my
heart
akes
at
the
remembrance
of
what
I
suffered
,
and
I
can
not
without
trembling
proceed
with
the
woeful
story
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
lain
insensible
some
days
,
he
recovered
the
use
of
speech
,
and
called
upon
my
name
,
which
he
had
a
thousand
times
repeated
,
while
he
was
bereft
of
reason
.
<EOS>
All
hopes
of
his
life
were
now
relinquished
,
and
I
was
led
to
his
bed
-
side
to
receive
his
last
adieu
,
being
directed
to
summon
all
my
fortitude
,
and
suppress
my
sorrow
,
that
he
might
not
be
disturbed
by
my
agitation
.
<EOS>
I
collected
all
my
resolution
to
support
me
in
this
affecting
scene
:
I
saw
my
dear
lord
in
extremity
;
the
beauties
of
his
youth
were
all
decayed
,
yet
his
eyes
,
though
languid
,
retained
unspeakable
sweetness
and
expression
.
<EOS>
He
felt
his
end
approaching
,
put
forth
his
hand
,
and
with
a
look
full
of
complacency
and
benevolence
,
uttered
such
a
tender
tale
 
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
how
had
I
deserved
such
accumulated
affliction
!
<EOS>
the
bare
remembrance
of
which
now
melts
me
into
tears
.
<EOS>
Human
nature
could
not
undergo
my
situation
,
without
suffering
an
extasy
of
grief
!
<EOS>
I
clasped
him
in
my
arms
,
and
kissed
him
a
thousand
times
,
with
the
most
violent
emotions
of
woe
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
torn
from
his
embrace
,
and
in
a
little
time
he
was
ravished
for
ever
from
my
view
.
    
<EOS>
On
that
fatal
morning
,
which
put
a
period
to
his
life
,
I
saw
the
duchess
of
L
#
#
#
#
approach
my
bed
,
and
,
from
her
appearance
,
concluded
that
he
was
no
more
;
yet
I
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
not
confirm
the
unhappy
presage
,
by
announcing
his
death
;
and
she
accordingly
preserved
the
most
emphatic
silence
.
<EOS>
I
got
up
,
and
trod
softly
over
his
head
,
as
if
I
had
been
afraid
of
interrupting
his
repose
.
<EOS>
Alas
!
<EOS>
he
was
no
longer
sensible
of
such
disturbance
.
<EOS>
I
was
seized
with
a
stupification
of
sorrow
:
I
threw
up
the
window
,
and
looking
around
,
thought
the
sun
shone
with
the
most
dismal
aspect
;
every
thing
was
solitary
,
chearless
,
and
replete
with
horror
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
condition
I
was
,
by
the
direction
of
my
friend
,
conveyed
to
her
house
,
where
my
faculties
were
so
overpowered
by
the
load
of
anguish
which
oppressed
me
,
that
I
know
not
what
passed
during
the
first
days
of
my
unhappy
widowhood
:
this
only
I
know
,
the
kind
duchess
treated
me
with
all
imaginable
care
and
compassion
,
and
carried
me
to
her
country
-
house
,
where
I
stayed
some
months
;
during
which
,
she
endeavoured
to
comfort
me
with
all
the
amusements
she
could
invent
,
and
laid
me
under
such
obligations
,
as
shall
never
be
erased
from
my
remembrance
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
all
her
care
and
concern
,
I
was
,
by
my
excess
of
grief
,
plunged
into
a
languishing
distemper
,
for
which
my
physicians
advised
me
to
drink
the
Bath
waters
.
    
<EOS>
In
compliance
with
this
prescription
,
I
went
thither
towards
the
end
of
summer
,
and
found
some
benefit
by
adhering
to
their
directions
;
though
I
seldom
went
abroad
,
except
when
I
visited
my
sister
-
in
-
law
,
who
was
there
with
the
princess
;
and
upon
these
occasions
,
I
never
failed
to
attract
the
notice
of
the
company
,
who
were
struck
with
the
appearance
of
such
a
young
creature
in
weeds
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
I
free
from
the
persecution
of
professed
admirers
;
but
being
dead
to
all
joy
,
I
was
deaf
to
the
voice
of
adulation
.
    
<EOS>
About
Christmas
,
I
repaired
to
my
father
's
house
,
where
my
sorrows
were
revived
by
every
object
that
recalled
the
idea
of
my
dear
lamented
lord
.
<EOS>
But
these
melancholy
reflections
I
was
obliged
to
bear
,
because
I
had
no
other
home
or
habitation
,
being
left
an
unprovided
widow
,
altogether
dependant
on
the
affection
of
my
own
family
.
    
<EOS>
During
this
winter
,
divers
overtures
were
made
to
my
father
,
by
people
who
demanded
me
in
marriage
;
but
my
heart
was
not
yet
sufficiently
weaned
from
my
former
passion
,
to
admit
the
thoughts
of
another
master
.
<EOS>
Among
those
that
presented
their
proposals
,
was
a
certain
young
nobleman
,
who
upon
the
first
news
of
lord
W####m
's
death
,
came
post
from
Paris
,
in
order
to
declare
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
first
appearance
in
a
hired
chariot
and
six
,
accompanied
by
a
big
fat
fellow
,
whom
(
as
I
afterwards
learn'd
)
he
had
engaged
to
sound
his
praises
,
with
the
promise
of
a
thousand
pounds
,
in
lieu
of
which
he
paid
him
with
forty
.
<EOS>
Whether
it
was
with
a
view
of
screening
himself
from
the
cold
,
or
of
making
a
comfortable
medium
in
case
of
being
overturned
,
and
falling
under
his
weighty
companion
,
I
know
not
;
but
certain
it
is
,
the
carriage
was
stuffed
with
hay
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
when
he
arrived
,
the
servants
were
at
some
pains
in
rummaging
and
removing
it
,
before
they
could
come
at
their
master
,
or
help
him
to
alight
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
was
lifted
out
of
the
chariot
,
he
exhibited
a
very
ludicrous
figure
to
the
view
:
he
was
a
thin
,
meagre
,
shivering
creature
,
of
a
low
stature
,
with
little
black
eyes
,
a
long
nose
,
sallow
complexion
,
and
pitted
with
the
small
pox
,
dressed
in
a
coat
of
light
brown
frize
,
lined
with
pink
-
coloured
shag
,
a
monstrous
solitaire
and
bag
,
and
(
if
I
remember
aright
)
a
pair
of
huge
jack
-
boots
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
his
whole
appearance
was
so
little
calculated
for
inspiring
love
,
that
I
had
(
on
the
strength
of
seeing
him
once
before
at
Oxford
)
set
him
down
as
the
last
man
on
earth
,
whom
I
would
chuse
to
we
d
;
and
I
will
venture
to
affirm
,
that
he
was
,
in
every
particular
,
the
very
reverse
of
my
late
husband
.
    
<EOS>
As
my
father
was
not
at
home
,
he
stayed
but
one
evening
,
and
left
his
errand
with
my
mother
,
to
whom
he
was
as
disagreeable
as
to
myself
;
so
that
his
proposal
was
absolutely
rejected
;
and
I
heard
no
more
of
him
during
the
space
of
three
whole
months
,
at
the
expiration
of
which
,
I
went
to
town
,
where
this
mortifying
figure
presented
itself
again
,
and
renewed
his
suit
,
offering
such
advantageous
terms
of
settlement
,
that
my
father
began
to
relish
the
match
,
and
warmly
recommended
it
to
my
consideration
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
W####m
's
relations
advised
me
to
embrace
the
opportunity
of
making
myself
independent
;
all
my
acquaintance
plied
me
with
with
arguments
to
the
same
purpose
:
I
was
uneasy
at
home
,
and
indifferent
to
all
mankind
.
<EOS>
I
weighed
the
motives
with
the
objections
,
and
with
reluctance
yielded
to
the
importunity
of
my
friends
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
determination
,
the
little
gentleman
was
permitted
to
visit
me
;
and
the
manner
of
his
address
did
not
at
all
alter
the
opinion
I
had
conceived
of
his
character
and
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
even
shocked
at
the
prospect
of
marrying
a
man
whom
I
could
not
love
;
and
,
in
order
to
disburthen
my
own
conscience
,
took
an
opportunity
of
telling
him
one
evening
,
as
we
sat
opposite
to
each
other
,
that
it
was
not
in
my
power
to
command
my
affection
,
and
therefore
he
could
not
expect
the
possession
of
my
heart
,
lord
W####m
's
indulgence
having
spoiled
me
for
a
wife
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
would
endeavour
to
contract
a
friendship
for
him
,
which
would
intirely
depend
upon
his
own
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
declaration
he
replied
(
to
my
great
surprize
)
that
he
did
not
desire
me
to
love
him
,
my
friendship
was
sufficient
;
and
next
day
,
repeated
this
strange
instance
of
moderation
in
a
letter
,
which
I
communicated
to
my
sister
,
who
laughed
heartily
at
the
contents
,
and
persuaded
me
,
that
since
I
could
love
no
man
,
he
was
the
properest
person
to
be
my
husband
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
wedding
cloaths
and
equipage
being
prepared
,
the
day
 
the
fatal
day
was
fixed
!
<EOS>
on
the
morning
of
which
,
I
went
to
the
house
of
my
brother
-
in
-
law
duke
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
loved
me
tenderly
,
and
took
my
leave
of
the
family
;
a
family
which
I
shall
always
remember
with
love
,
honour
,
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
His
grace
received
me
in
the
most
affectionate
manner
,
saying
at
parting
,
"
Lady
W####m
,
if
he
does
not
use
you
well
,
I
will
take
you
back
again
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
and
I
met
at
Ox
 
chapel
,
where
the
ceremony
was
performed
by
the
bishop
of
W
#
#
#
#
,
in
presence
of
his
mother
,
my
father
,
and
another
lady
;
and
the
nuptial
knot
being
tied
,
we
set
out
for
my
father
's
house
in
the
country
,
and
proceeded
full
twenty
miles
on
our
journey
,
before
my
lord
opened
his
mouth
;
my
thoughts
having
been
all
that
time
employed
on
something
quite
foreign
to
my
present
situation
;
for
I
was
then
but
a
giddy
girl
of
eighteen
.
<EOS>
At
length
my
father
broke
silence
,
and
clapping
his
lordship
on
the
shoulder
,
told
him
he
was
but
<EOS>
a
dull
bridegroom
;
upon
which
,
my
lord
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
was
out
of
spirits
.
<EOS>
This
dejection
continued
all
the
day
,
notwithstanding
the
refreshment
of
a
plentiful
dinner
,
which
he
ate
upon
the
road
;
and
in
the
evening
we
arrived
at
the
place
of
destination
,
where
we
were
kindly
received
by
my
mother
,
though
she
had
no
liking
to
the
match
;
and
after
supper
,
we
retired
to
our
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
here
that
I
had
occasion
to
perceive
the
most
disagreeable
contrast
between
my
present
help
-
mate
and
my
former
lord
:
instead
of
flying
to
my
arms
with
all
the
eagerness
of
love
and
rapture
,
this
manly
representative
sat
moping
in
a
corner
,
like
a
criminal
on
execution
-
day
,
and
owned
he
was
ashamed
to
bed
a
woman
,
whose
hand
he
had
scarce
ever
touched
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
being
affected
with
this
pusilanimous
behaviour
:
I
remembered
lord
W####m
,
while
I
surveyed
the
object
before
me
,
and
made
such
a
comparison
as
filled
me
with
horror
and
disgust
:
nay
,
to
such
a
degree
did
my
aversion
to
this
phantom
prevail
,
that
I
began
to
sweat
with
anguish
at
the
thought
of
being
subjected
to
his
pleasure
:
and
when
,
after
a
long
hesitation
,
he
ventured
to
approach
me
,
I
trembled
as
if
I
had
been
exposed
to
the
embraces
of
a
rattlesnake
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
efforts
of
his
love
diminish
this
antipathy
;
his
attempts
were
like
the
pawings
of
an
imp
,
sent
from
hell
to
teize
and
torment
some
guilty
wretch
,
<EOS>
such
as
are
exhibited
in
some
dramatic
performance
,
which
I
never
see
acted
,
without
remembering
my
wedding
-
night
.
    
<EOS>
By
such
shadowy
,
unsubstantial
,
vexatious
behaviour
,
was
I
tantalized
,
and
robb'd
of
my
repose
;
and
early
next
morning
I
got
up
,
with
a
most
sovereign
contempt
for
my
bedfellow
,
who
indulged
himself
in
bed
till
eleven
.
    
<EOS>
Having
passed
a
few
days
in
this
place
,
I
went
home
with
him
to
his
house
at
Twickenham
;
and
soon
after
we
were
presented
at
court
,
when
the
queen
was
pleased
to
say
to
my
lord
's
mother
,
she
did
not
doubt
that
we
should
be
an
happy
couple
,
for
I
had
been
a
good
wife
to
my
former
husband
.
    
<EOS>
Whatever
deficiencies
I
had
to
complain
of
in
my
new
spouse
,
he
was
not
wanting
in
point
of
liberality
:
I
was
presented
with
a
very
fine
chariot
studded
with
silver
nails
,
and
such
a
profusion
of
jewels
as
furnished
a
joke
to
some
of
my
acquaintance
,
who
observed
that
I
was
formerly
queen
of
hearts
,
but
now
metamorphosed
into
the
queen
of
diamonds
.
<EOS>
This
uncommon
splendour
attracted
the
eyes
and
envy
of
my
competitors
,
who
were
the
more
implacable
in
their
resentments
,
because
,
notwithstanding
my
marriage
,
I
was
as
much
as
ever
followed
by
the
men
of
gallantry
and
pleasure
,
among
whom
it
is
a
constant
maxim
,
that
a
woman
never
with
-
holds
her
affections
from
her
husband
,
without
an
intention
to
bestow
them
somewhere
else
.
<EOS>
I
never
appeared
without
a
train
of
admirers
,
and
my
house
in
the
country
was
always
crouded
with
gay
young
men
of
quality
.
    
<EOS>
Among
those
who
cultivated
my
good
graces
with
the
greatest
skill
and
assiduity
,
were
the
earl
C
#
#
#
#
,
and
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
brother
to
lord
F
#
#
#
#
.
    
<EOS>
The
former
of
whom
,
in
the
course
of
his
addresses
,
treated
me
with
an
entertainment
of
surprising
magnificence
,
disposed
into
a
dinner
,
supper
,
and
ball
;
to
which
I
,
at
his
desire
,
invited
eleven
ladies
,
whom
he
paired
with
the
like
number
of
his
own
sex
:
so
that
the
whole
company
amounted
to
twenty
-
four
.
<EOS>
We
were
regaled
with
a
most
elegant
dinner
,
in
an
apartment
which
was
altogether
superb
,
and
served
by
gentlemen
only
,
no
livery
-
servant
being
permited
to
come
within
the
door
.
<EOS>
In
the
afternoon
we
embarked
in
two
splendid
barges
,
being
attended
by
a
band
of
musick
,
in
a
third
;
and
enjoyed
a
delightful
evening
upon
the
river
,
till
the
twilight
,
when
we
returned
,
and
began
the
ball
,
which
was
conducted
with
such
order
and
taste
,
that
mirth
and
good
humour
prevailed
,
and
no
dissatisfaction
appeared
,
except
in
the
countenance
of
one
old
maid
,
since
married
to
a
son
of
the
duke
of
 
,
who
,
tho
'
she
would
not
refuse
to
partake
of
such
an
agreeable
entertainment
,
was
displeased
that
I
should
have
the
honour
of
inviting
her
.
<EOS>
O
baleful
Envy
!
<EOS>
thou
self
-
tormenting
fiend
!
<EOS>
How
do'st
thou
predominate
in
all
assemblies
,
from
the
grand
gala
of
a
court
to
the
meeting
of
simple
peasants
at
their
harvest
-
home
!
<EOS>
Nor
is
the
prevalence
of
this
sordid
passion
to
be
wondered
at
,
if
we
consider
the
weakness
,
pride
,
and
vanity
of
our
sex
.
<EOS>
The
presence
of
one
favourite
man
shall
poison
the
enjoyment
of
a
whole
company
,
and
produce
the
most
rancorous
enmity
betwixt
the
closest
friends
.
    
<EOS>
I
danced
with
the
master
of
the
ball
,
who
employed
all
the
artillery
of
his
eloquence
in
making
love
;
yet
I
did
not
listen
to
his
addresses
,
for
he
was
not
to
my
taste
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
possessed
an
agreeable
person
,
and
a
good
acquired
understanding
;
but
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
that
gentle
prevailing
art
which
I
afterwards
experienced
in
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
and
which
was
the
only
method
he
could
have
successfully
practised
,
in
seducing
a
young
woman
like
me
,
born
with
sentiments
of
honour
,
and
trained
up
in
the
paths
of
religion
and
virtue
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
indeed
,
absolutely
master
of
those
insinuating
qualifications
which
few
women
of
passion
and
sensibility
can
resist
;
and
had
a
person
every
way
adapted
for
profiting
by
these
insidious
talents
.
<EOS>
He
was
well
acquainted
with
the
human
heart
,
conscious
of
his
own
power
and
capacity
,
and
exercised
these
endowments
with
unwearied
perseverance
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
and
thin
,
which
was
perfectly
agreeable
to
my
taste
,
with
large
blue
eloquent
eyes
,
good
teeth
,
and
a
long
head
turned
to
gallantry
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
was
the
standard
of
politeness
,
and
all
his
advances
were
conducted
with
the
most
profound
respect
;
which
is
the
most
effectual
expedient
a
man
can
use
against
us
,
if
he
can
find
means
to
persuade
us
,
that
it
proceeds
from
the
excess
and
delicacy
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
It
is
no
other
than
a
silent
compliment
,
by
which
our
accomplishments
are
continually
flattered
,
and
pleases
in
proportion
to
the
supposed
understanding
of
him
who
pays
it
.
    
<EOS>
By
these
arts
and
advantages
this
consummate
politician
in
love
began
by
degrees
to
sap
the
foundations
of
my
conjugal
faith
;
he
stole
imperceptibly
into
my
affection
,
and
,
by
dint
of
opportunity
,
which
he
well
knew
how
to
improve
,
triumphed
,
at
last
,
over
all
his
rivals
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
was
he
the
only
person
that
disputed
my
heart
with
Earl
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
also
rivaled
by
lord
C
#
#
#
#
H
#
#
#
#
,
a
Scotchman
,
who
had
been
an
intimate
and
relation
of
my
former
husband
.
    
<EOS>
This
gentleman
I
would
have
preferred
to
most
of
his
competitors
,
and
I
coqueted
with
him
for
some
time
:
but
this
amour
was
interrupted
by
his
going
to
Ireland
;
upon
which
occasion
,
understanding
that
he
was
but
indifferently
provided
with
money
,
I
made
him
a
present
of
a
gold
snuff
-
box
,
in
which
was
inclosed
a
bank
-
note
;
a
trifling
mark
of
my
esteem
,
which
he
afterwards
justified
by
the
most
grateful
,
friendly
,
and
genteel
behaviour
;
and
as
we
corresponded
by
letters
,
I
frankly
told
him
,
that
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
had
stept
in
,
and
won
the
palm
from
all
the
rest
of
my
admirers
.
    
<EOS>
This
new
favourite
's
mothers
and
sisters
,
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
,
were
my
constant
companions
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
this
intimacy
,
he
never
let
a
day
pass
without
paying
his
respects
to
me
in
person
;
<EOS>
nay
,
so
ingenious
was
he
in
contriving
the
means
of
promoting
his
suit
,
that
whether
I
rode
or
walked
,
went
abroad
or
stayed
at
home
,
he
was
always
of
course
one
of
the
party
:
so
that
his
design
seemed
to
ingross
his
whole
vigilance
and
attention
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
studied
my
disposition
,
and
established
himself
in
my
good
opinion
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
He
found
my
heart
was
susceptible
of
every
tender
impression
,
and
saw
that
I
was
not
free
from
the
vanity
of
youth
;
he
had
already
acquired
my
friendship
and
esteem
,
from
which
he
knew
there
was
a
short
and
easy
transition
to
love
;
and
by
his
penetration
choosing
proper
seasons
for
the
theme
,
urged
it
with
such
pathetic
vows
and
artful
adulation
,
as
well
might
captivate
a
young
woman
of
my
complexion
and
inexperience
,
and
circumstanced
as
I
was
,
with
a
husband
whom
I
had
such
reason
to
despise
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
he
thus
made
an
insensible
progress
in
my
heart
,
he
did
not
find
my
virtue
an
easy
conquest
;
and
I
myself
was
ignorant
of
the
advantage
he
had
gained
,
with
regard
to
my
inclinations
,
until
I
was
convinced
of
his
success
by
an
alarm
of
jealousy
which
I
one
day
felt
,
at
seeing
him
engaged
in
conversation
with
another
lady
.
<EOS>
I
forthwith
recognized
this
symptom
of
love
,
with
which
I
had
been
formerly
acquainted
,
and
trembled
at
the
discovery
of
my
own
weakness
.
<EOS>
I
underwent
a
strange
agitation
and
mixture
of
contrary
sensations
:
I
was
pleased
with
the
passion
,
yet
ashamed
of
avowing
it
even
to
my
own
mind
.
<EOS>
The
rights
of
a
husband
(
tho
'
mine
was
but
a
nominal
one
)
<EOS>
occurred
to
my
reflexion
,
and
virtue
,
modesty
and
honour
forbad
me
to
cherish
the
guilty
flame
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
encouraged
these
laudable
scruples
,
and
resolved
to
sacrifice
my
love
to
duty
and
reputation
,
my
lord
was
almost
every
day
employed
in
riding
post
to
my
father
,
with
complaints
of
my
conduct
,
which
was
hitherto
irreproachable
;
tho
'
the
greatest
grievance
which
he
pretended
to
have
suffered
,
was
my
refusing
to
comply
with
his
desire
,
when
he
intreated
me
to
lie
a
whole
hour
every
morning
,
with
my
neck
uncovered
,
<EOS>
that
by
gazing
he
might
quiet
the
perturbation
of
his
spirits
.
<EOS>
From
this
request
you
may
judge
of
the
man
,
as
well
as
of
the
regard
I
must
entertain
for
his
character
and
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
During
the
whole
summer
I
was
besieged
by
my
artful
undoer
,
and
in
the
autumn
set
out
with
my
lord
for
Bath
,
where
,
by
reason
of
the
intimacy
that
subsisted
between
our
families
,
we
lived
in
the
same
house
with
my
lover
and
his
sister
,
who
,
with
another
agreeable
young
lady
,
accompanied
us
in
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
had
extorted
from
me
a
confession
of
a
mutual
flame
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
assured
him
that
it
should
never
induce
me
to
give
up
the
valuable
possessions
of
an
unspotted
character
,
and
a
conscience
void
of
offence
.
<EOS>
I
offered
him
all
the
enjoyment
he
could
reap
from
an
unreserved
intercourse
of
souls
,
abstracted
from
any
sensual
consideration
;
and
he
eagerly
embraced
the
Platonic
proposal
,
because
he
had
sagacity
enough
to
foresee
the
issue
of
such
chimerical
contracts
,
and
knew
me
too
well
to
think
he
could
accomplish
his
purpose
without
seeming
to
acquiesce
in
my
own
terms
,
and
cultivating
my
tenderness
under
the
specious
pretext
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
agreement
we
took
all
opportunities
of
seeing
each
other
in
private
;
and
these
interviews
were
spent
in
mutual
protestations
of
disinterested
love
.
<EOS>
This
correspondence
,
tho
'
dangerous
,
was
(
on
my
side
)
equally
innocent
and
endearing
;
and
many
happy
hours
<EOS>
we
pass'd
,
before
my
sentiments
were
discovered
.
<EOS>
At
length
my
lover
was
taken
ill
,
and
then
my
passion
burst
out
beyond
the
power
of
concealment
;
my
grief
and
anxiety
became
so
conspicuous
in
my
countenance
,
and
my
behaviour
was
so
indiscreet
,
that
every
body
in
the
house
perceived
the
situation
of
my
thoughts
,
and
blamed
my
conduct
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
Certain
<EOS>
it
is
I
was
extremely
imprudent
,
tho
'
intentionally
innocent
.
<EOS>
I
have
lain
whole
nights
by
my
lord
,
who
teized
and
tormented
me
for
that
which
neither
I
could
give
nor
he
could
take
,
and
ruminated
on
the
fatal
consequence
of
this
unhappy
flame
,
until
I
was
worked
into
a
fever
of
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
I
saw
there
was
no
safety
but
in
flight
,
and
often
determined
to
banish
myself
for
ever
from
the
sight
of
this
dangerous
intruder
.
<EOS>
But
my
resolution
always
failed
at
the
approach
of
day
,
and
my
desire
of
seeing
him
as
constantly
recurred
.
<EOS>
So
far
was
I
from
persisting
in
such
commendable
determinations
,
that
,
on
the
eve
of
our
departure
from
Bath
,
I
felt
the
keenest
pangs
of
sorrow
at
our
approaching
separation
;
and
as
we
could
not
enjoy
our
private
interviews
at
my
house
in
town
,
I
promised
to
visit
him
at
his
own
apartments
,
after
he
had
sworn
by
all
that
's
sacred
,
that
he
would
take
no
sinister
advantage
of
my
condescension
,
by
presuming
upon
the
opportunities
I
should
give
.
    
<EOS>
He
kept
his
word
;
for
he
saw
I
trusted
to
it
with
fear
and
trembling
,
and
perceived
that
my
apprehension
was
not
affected
,
but
the
natural
concern
of
a
young
creature
,
distracted
between
love
and
duty
,
whom
,
had
he
alarmed
,
he
never
would
have
seen
within
his
doors
again
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
pressing
me
with
sollicitations
in
favour
of
his
passion
,
he
was
more
than
ever
respectful
and
complaisant
;
so
that
I
found
myself
disengaged
of
all
restraint
,
conducted
the
conversation
,
shortened
and
repeated
my
visits
,
at
my
own
pleasure
,
till
,
at
last
<EOS>
,
I
became
so
accustomed
to
this
communication
,
that
his
house
was
as
familiar
to
me
as
my
own
.
    
<EOS>
Having
in
this
manner
secured
himself
in
my
confidence
,
he
resumed
the
favourite
topic
of
love
,
and
warming
my
imagination
by
gradual
advances
on
the
subject
,
my
heart
began
to
pant
;
and
when
he
saw
me
thus
,
he
snatched
the
favourable
occasion
to
practise
all
his
eloquence
and
art
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
resist
his
energy
,
nor
even
fly
from
the
temptation
that
assailed
me
,
until
he
had
obtained
a
promise
that
he
should
,
at
our
next
meeting
,
reap
the
fruits
of
his
tedious
expectation
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
condition
I
was
permitted
to
retire
,
and
blessed
heaven
for
my
escape
,
fully
determined
to
continue
in
the
path
of
virtue
I
had
hitherto
trod
,
and
stifle
the
criminal
flame
,
by
which
my
peace
and
reputation
were
endangered
.
<EOS>
But
his
idea
,
which
reigned
within
my
heart
,
without
controul
,
soon
baffled
all
those
prudent
suggestions
.
    
<EOS>
I
saw
him
again
;
and
he
reminded
me
of
my
promise
,
which
I
endeavoured
to
evade
with
affected
pleasantry
;
upon
which
he
manifested
the
utmost
displeasure
and
chagrin
,
shedding
some
crocodile
tears
,
and
upbraiding
me
with
levity
and
indifference
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
he
had
sollicited
my
favour
for
ten
long
months
,
without
intermission
,
and
imagined
I
had
held
out
so
long
on
virtuous
motives
only
;
but
now
he
could
plainly
perceive
that
his
want
of
success
had
been
owing
to
my
want
of
affection
;
and
that
all
my
professions
were
insincere
:
in
a
word
,
he
persuaded
me
,
that
his
remonstrances
were
just
and
reasonable
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
see
the
affliction
of
a
man
I
loved
,
when
I
knew
it
was
in
my
power
to
remove
it
;
and
rather
than
forfeit
his
opinion
of
my
sincerity
and
love
,
I
consented
to
his
wish
.
<EOS>
My
heart
now
flutters
at
the
remembrance
of
the
dear
,
tho
'
fatal
indiscretion
;
yet
I
reflect
without
remorse
,
and
even
remember
it
with
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
If
I
could
not
avoid
the
censure
of
the
world
,
I
was
resolved
to
bear
it
without
repining
;
and
sure
the
guilt
(
if
there
was
any
in
my
conduct
)
was
but
venial
;
for
I
considered
myself
as
a
person
absolved
of
all
matrimonial
ties
,
by
the
insignificance
of
lord
  
,
who
,
tho
'
a
nominal
husband
,
was
,
in
fact
,
a
mere
non
-
entity
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
contracted
a
new
engagement
with
my
lover
,
to
which
I
resolved
to
adhere
with
the
most
scrupulous
fidelity
,
without
the
least
intention
of
injuring
my
lord
or
his
relations
;
for
had
our
mutual
passion
produced
any
visible
effects
,
I
would
immediately
have
renounced
and
abandoned
my
husband
for
ever
,
that
the
fruit
of
my
love
for
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
might
not
have
inherited
,
to
the
detriment
of
the
right
heir
.
<EOS>
This
was
my
determination
,
which
I
thought
just
,
if
not
prudent
;
and
for
which
I
have
incurred
the
imputation
of
folly
,
in
the
opinion
of
this
wise
and
honest
generation
,
by
whose
example
and
advice
I
have
,
since
that
time
,
been
a
little
reformed
in
point
of
prudentials
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
still
retain
a
strong
tendency
to
return
to
my
primitive
way
of
thinking
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
quitted
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
after
the
sacrifice
I
had
made
,
and
returned
to
my
own
bed
,
it
may
perhaps
be
supposed
that
I
slept
but
little
.
<EOS>
True
:
I
was
kept
awake
by
the
joyful
impatience
of
revisiting
my
lover
.
<EOS>
Indeed
I
neglected
no
opportunity
of
flying
to
his
arms
:
when
lord
   
was
in
the
country
we
enjoyed
each
other
's
company
without
interruption
,
but
when
he
resided
in
town
our
correspondence
was
limited
to
stolen
interviews
,
which
were
unspeakably
delicious
,
as
genuine
love
presided
at
the
entertainment
.
    
<EOS>
Such
was
my
happiness
,
in
the
course
of
this
tender
communication
,
that
to
this
day
I
remember
it
with
pleasure
,
tho
'
<EOS>
it
has
cost
me
dear
in
the
sequel
,
and
was
at
that
time
enjoyed
at
a
considerable
expence
;
for
I
devoted
myself
so
intirely
to
my
lover
,
who
was
desirous
of
engrossing
my
time
and
thoughts
,
that
my
acquaintance
,
which
was
very
numerous
,
justly
accused
me
of
neglect
,
and
of
consequence
cooled
in
their
friendships
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
all
for
love
,
or
the
world
well
lost
.
<EOS>
And
were
the
same
opportunity
to
offer
,
I
would
act
the
same
conduct
over
again
.
    
<EOS>
Some
there
are
who
possibly
may
wonder
how
I
could
love
twice
with
such
violence
of
affection
:
but
all
such
observers
must
be
unacquainted
with
the
human
heart
.
<EOS>
Mine
was
naturally
adapted
for
the
tender
passions
,
and
had
been
so
fortunate
,
so
cherished
,
in
its
first
impressions
,
that
it
felt
with
joy
the
same
sensations
revive
,
when
influenced
by
the
same
engaging
qualifications
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
I
loved
the
second
time
as
well
as
the
first
,
and
better
was
impossible
.
<EOS>
I
gave
up
my
all
for
both
:
fortune
and
my
father
's
favour
for
the
one
;
reputation
,
friends
,
and
fortune
for
the
other
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
notwithstanding
this
intimate
connexion
,
I
did
not
relinquish
the
world
all
at
once
;
on
the
contrary
I
still
appeared
at
court
,
and
attracted
the
notice
and
approbation
of
my
royal
patroness
;
I
danced
with
the
p
#
#
#
#
of
W
#
#
#
#
;
a
circumstance
which
so
nearly
affected
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
present
,
that
,
in
order
to
manifest
his
resentment
,
he
chose
the
ugliest
woman
in
the
ball
for
his
partner
;
and
I
no
sooner
perceived
his
uneasiness
than
I
gave
over
,
with
a
view
of
appeasing
his
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
Without
repeating
particular
circumstances
,
let
it
suffice
to
say
,
our
mutual
passion
was
a
perfect
copy
of
that
which
had
subsisted
between
me
and
my
dear
lord
W####m
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
jealous
,
melting
and
delicate
,
and
checquered
with
little
accidents
,
which
serve
to
animate
and
maintain
the
flame
,
in
its
first
ardency
of
rapture
.
<EOS>
When
my
lover
was
sick
,
I
attended
and
nursed
him
with
indefatigable
tenderness
and
care
;
and
during
an
indisposition
which
I
caught
in
the
performance
of
this
agreeable
office
,
he
discharged
the
obligation
with
all
the
warmth
of
sympathy
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
,
however
,
judged
necessary
by
the
physicians
,
that
I
should
use
the
Bath
-
waters
for
the
recovery
of
my
health
;
and
I
set
out
for
that
place
,
glad
of
a
pretence
to
be
absent
from
lord
  
,
with
whom
I
lived
on
very
unhappy
terms
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
about
nine
months
after
our
marriage
,
desired
that
we
might
sleep
in
separate
beds
,
and
gave
a
very
whimsical
reason
for
this
proposal
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
the
immensity
of
his
love
deprived
him
of
the
power
of
gratification
,
and
that
some
commerce
with
an
object
,
to
which
his
heart
was
not
attached
,
might
,
by
diminishing
the
transports
of
his
spirits
,
recompose
his
nerves
,
and
enable
him
to
enjoy
the
fruits
of
his
good
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
You
may
be
sure
I
made
no
objections
to
this
plan
,
which
was
immediately
put
in
execution
.
<EOS>
He
made
his
addresses
to
a
nymph
of
Drury
-
lane
,
whose
name
(
as
he
told
me
)
was
Mrs
Rock
.
<EOS>
She
made
shift
to
extract
some
money
from
her
patient
;
but
his
infirmity
was
beyond
the
power
of
her
art
;
though
she
made
some
mischief
between
us
;
and
I
communicated
my
suspicion
to
duke
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
intended
to
have
expostulated
with
her
upon
the
subject
;
but
she
got
intimation
of
his
design
,
and
saved
him
the
trouble
,
by
a
precipitate
retreat
.
    
<EOS>
After
my
return
from
the
Bath
,
where
Mr
S
and
I
had
lived
happily
,
until
we
were
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
my
husband
,
his
lordship
expressed
an
inclination
to
be
my
bedfellow
again
;
but
in
this
particular
I
desired
to
be
excused
:
for
though
I
would
not
be
the
first
to
propose
the
separation
,
which
,
though
usual
in
other
countries
,
is
contrary
to
the
custom
of
England
,
being
unwilling
to
furnish
the
least
handle
for
censure
,
as
my
character
was
still
unblemished
;
yet
,
when
the
proposal
came
from
himself
,
I
thought
myself
intitled
to
refuse
a
re
-
union
,
to
which
I
accordingly
objected
.
    
<EOS>
This
opposition
produced
a
quarrel
,
which
rose
to
a
state
of
perpetual
animosity
;
so
that
we
began
to
talk
of
parting
.
<EOS>
My
lord
relished
the
expedient
,
agreeing
to
add
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
to
my
pin
-
money
,
which
(
by
the
bye
)
was
never
paid
;
and
I
renounced
all
state
and
grandeur
,
to
live
in
a
small
house
that
I
hired
at
Casehorton
,
where
I
passed
my
time
for
two
months
,
in
the
most
agreeable
retirement
,
with
my
dear
over
,
till
I
was
disturbed
by
the
intrusion
of
my
Lord
,
who
molested
me
with
visits
and
solicitations
to
return
,
pretending
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
,
and
insisting
upon
my
compliance
with
his
desire
.
    
<EOS>
I
exhausted
my
invention
in
endeavours
to
evade
his
request
;
but
he
persecuted
me
without
ceasing
:
so
that
I
was
fain
to
capitulate
,
on
condition
that
we
should
immediately
set
out
for
France
;
and
that
he
should
not
presume
to
approach
my
bed
,
till
our
arrival
at
Calais
.
<EOS>
We
accordingly
departed
for
that
kingdom
;
and
,
far
from
infringing
the
last
article
of
our
treaty
,
his
lordship
did
not
insist
upon
his
privilege
,
before
we
reached
the
capital
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
began
to
feel
the
effect
of
my
passion
in
a
very
interesting
manner
,
and
communicated
my
discovery
to
the
dear
author
of
it
,
who
would
not
leave
me
in
such
an
affecting
situation
,
but
took
the
first
opportunity
of
following
us
to
France
.
    
<EOS>
In
our
road
to
Paris
,
we
stopp'd
to
visit
Chantilly
,
a
magnificent
Chateau
belonging
to
the
prince
of
Conde
,
and
there
met
by
accident
with
some
English
noblemen
,
to
whom
I
was
known
.
<EOS>
The
prince
and
his
sisters
invited
me
very
politely
into
the
gallery
where
they
sat
.
<EOS>
They
complimented
me
on
my
person
,
and
seemed
to
admire
my
dress
,
which
was
altogether
new
to
them
,
being
a
blue
English
riding
-
habit
trimmed
with
gold
,
and
an
hat
with
a
feather
.
<EOS>
They
were
particularly
well
pleased
with
my
hair
,
which
hung
down
to
my
waist
,
and
pressed
me
to
stay
a
fortnight
at
their
house
;
an
invitation
which
I
was
very
much
mortified
at
being
obliged
to
refuse
,
because
my
lord
did
not
understand
the
French
language
.
<EOS>
I
was
inchanted
with
the
place
and
the
company
,
the
women
being
amiable
and
the
men
polite
;
nor
were
they
strangers
to
my
name
and
story
;
for
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
calling
at
the
same
place
a
few
days
after
,
they
rallied
him
on
my
account
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
at
Paris
,
the
first
thing
I
did
was
to
metamorphose
myself
into
a
French
woman
.
<EOS>
I
cut
off
my
hair
,
hid
a
very
good
complexion
of
my
own
with
Rouge
,
reconciled
myself
to
powder
,
which
I
had
never
used
before
,
put
on
a
robe
with
a
large
hoop
,
and
went
to
the
Thuilleries
,
full
of
spirits
and
joy
;
for
at
that
time
every
thing
conspired
to
make
me
happy
:
    
<EOS>
I
had
health
,
youth
and
beauty
,
love
,
vanity
and
affluence
,
and
found
myself
surrounded
with
diversions
,
which
were
gay
,
new
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
My
appearance
drew
upon
me
the
eyes
of
the
whole
company
,
who
considered
me
as
a
stranger
,
but
not
a
foreigner
,
so
compleatly
was
I
equipped
in
the
fashion
of
the
French
;
and
when
they
understood
who
I
was
,
they
applauded
my
person
with
the
most
lavish
encomiums
,
according
to
their
known
politeness
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
made
a
circuit
round
all
the
public
places
of
entertainment
in
Paris
,
I
was
introduced
into
company
,
by
an
English
family
residing
in
that
city
;
and
,
among
others
,
became
acquainted
with
a
French
lady
,
whose
charms
were
remarkably
attractive
.
<EOS>
The
duke
of
K
#
#
#
#
was
her
admirer
;
but
she
lived
in
reputation
with
her
mother
and
an
agreeable
sister
,
whose
lover
was
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
(
for
almost
every
lady
in
France
has
her
Amant
.
)
    
<EOS>
With
this
charming
woman
,
whose
name
was
Madam
De
la
T
#
#
#
#
,
I
often
made
parties
of
pleasure
.
<EOS>
The
duke
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
she
and
I
,
used
to
meet
in
the
Bois
de
Boulogne
,
which
is
a
pleasant
wood
at
a
small
distance
from
Paris
,
whither
the
company
repairs
,
in
the
summer
-
season
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
;
and
after
having
amused
ourselves
among
the
groves
,
embarked
in
his
grace
's
equipage
,
which
was
extremely
elegant
,
being
a
calash
drawn
by
six
fine
long
-
tailed
greys
,
adorned
with
ribbons
in
the
French
taste
;
and
thus
we
were
conducted
to
a
little
inchanted
,
or
at
least
inchanting
palace
,
possessed
by
the
duke
,
at
one
end
of
the
town
.
    
<EOS>
The
lower
apartment
,
appropriated
to
me
,
was
furnished
with
yellow
and
silver
,
the
bed
surrounded
with
looking
-
glasses
,
and
the
door
opened
into
a
garden
,
laid
out
in
a
cradle
-
walk
,
and
intervening
parterres
of
roses
and
other
flowers
.
<EOS>
Above
stairs
my
female
companion
lodged
,
in
a
chamber
furnished
with
chintz
.
<EOS>
We
supped
all
together
in
the
saloon
,
which
,
though
small
,
was
perfectly
elegant
.
<EOS>
The
company
was
always
good
-
humoured
,
the
conversation
sprightly
and
joyous
,
and
the
scene
,
though
often
repeated
,
still
delightful
and
entertaining
.
    
<EOS>
At
other
times
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
and
I
used
to
pass
our
evenings
at
the
palace
of
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
which
his
highness
lent
us
for
our
accommodation
.
<EOS>
The
apartments
opened
into
the
gardens
of
the
Luxembourg
,
and
were
,
in
point
of
magnificence
,
suitable
to
the
owner
.
<EOS>
Thither
I
used
to
repair
in
a
flaming
equipage
,
on
pretence
of
visiting
,
and
spent
the
best
part
of
the
night
with
him
,
who
was
dearer
to
me
than
all
the
princes
in
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
was
happily
engaged
in
these
ravishing
parties
,
my
little
lord
was
employed
in
efforts
to
recover
his
health
by
restoratives
,
and
I
know
not
what
;
for
he
still
lamented
the
enfeebling
effects
of
his
passion
,
and
complained
,
that
he
loved
me
more
like
an
angel
than
a
woman
,
though
he
strove
to
govern
his
affection
according
to
the
doctrines
of
the
christian
religion
,
as
he
regulated
his
life
by
the
maxims
of
Charles
the
twelfth
of
Sweden
.
<EOS>
The
meaning
of
this
declaration
I
could
never
learn
;
and
indeed
,
I
have
been
often
tempted
to
believe
he
had
no
meaning
at
all
.
    
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
will
,
I
found
my
size
visibly
increasing
,
and
my
situation
extremely
uneasy
,
on
account
of
the
perpetual
wrangling
which
prevailed
betwixt
us
,
in
consequence
of
his
desiring
to
sleep
with
me
again
,
after
we
had
parted
beds
for
the
second
time
:
and
,
that
I
might
be
no
longer
exposed
to
such
disagreeable
persecution
,
I
resolved
to
leave
him
,
though
at
the
hazard
of
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
determined
,
I
went
to
the
British
embassador
in
an
hackney
coach
;
and
,
in
order
to
disguise
my
youth
,
which
might
have
prepossessed
him
against
my
judgment
,
muffled
myself
up
in
a
black
hood
,
which
(
as
he
said
)
instead
of
lending
an
air
of
gravity
to
my
countenance
,
added
a
wildness
to
my
looks
,
which
was
far
from
being
disagreeable
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
a
gallant
man
in
his
youth
,
and
even
then
,
though
well
stricken
in
years
,
was
not
insensible
to
the
power
of
beauty
.
<EOS>
This
disposition
,
perhaps
,
rendered
him
more
favourable
to
my
cause
,
though
he
at
first
advised
me
to
return
to
my
husband
;
but
finding
me
obstinate
,
he
undertook
to
serve
me
in
my
own
way
,
and
procure
a
protection
from
the
French
king
,
by
virtue
of
which
,
I
could
live
at
Paris
unmolested
by
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
advised
me
(
if
I
was
determined
to
leave
him
)
to
make
the
best
of
my
way
to
England
,
and
sue
for
a
divorce
.
    
<EOS>
I
relished
his
opinion
,
and
concealed
myself
about
three
days
in
Paris
,
during
which
I
borrowed
some
linen
;
for
,
as
it
was
impossible
to
convey
any
thing
out
of
my
own
house
without
suspicion
,
I
had
neither
cloaths
for
my
accommodation
,
nor
a
servant
to
wait
on
me
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
solitary
condition
I
took
the
road
to
Flanders
,
after
I
had
put
my
lord
upon
a
wrong
scent
,
by
writing
a
letter
to
him
,
dated
at
Calais
,
and
travelled
through
an
unknown
country
,
without
any
other
attendant
than
the
postilion
,
being
subjected
to
this
inconvenience
by
the
laws
of
France
,
which
are
so
severe
in
some
particulars
,
that
if
any
person
had
been
apprehended
with
me
,
he
would
have
suffered
death
,
for
going
off
with
a
man
's
wife
;
though
any
man
might
go
to
bed
with
the
same
woman
,
without
fear
of
incurring
any
legal
punishment
.
    
<EOS>
I
proceeded
night
and
day
without
intermission
,
that
I
might
the
sooner
reach
Flanders
,
where
I
knew
I
should
be
safe
;
and
as
the
nights
were
excessively
cold
,
I
was
fain
to
wrap
myself
up
in
flannel
,
which
I
bought
for
the
purpose
,
as
I
had
no
cloaths
to
keep
me
warm
,
and
travelled
in
an
open
chaise
.
<EOS>
While
we
passed
through
dreary
woods
,
quite
remote
from
the
habitations
of
men
,
I
was
not
without
apprehension
of
being
stripped
and
murthered
by
the
postilion
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
owed
my
safety
to
the
indigence
of
my
appearance
,
which
might
also
protect
me
in
two
miserable
places
where
I
was
obliged
to
lie
,
before
I
got
out
of
the
territories
of
France
;
for
,
as
I
could
not
reach
the
great
towns
where
I
intended
to
lodge
,
I
was
under
the
necessity
of
putting
up
at
little
wretched
hovels
,
where
no
provision
was
to
be
had
,
but
four
brown
bread
and
sourer
cheese
;
and
every
thing
seemed
to
denote
the
dens
of
despair
and
assassination
.
    
<EOS>
I
made
shift
,
however
,
to
subsist
on
this
fare
,
uncomfortable
as
it
was
,
confided
in
the
meanness
of
my
equipage
for
the
security
of
my
person
;
and
at
length
arriving
at
Brussels
,
fixed
my
quarters
in
the
Hotel
de
Flandre
<EOS>
(
so
well
known
to
the
English
since
)
where
I
thought
myself
extremely
happy
in
the
accomplishment
of
my
flight
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
full
two
days
in
this
place
,
when
I
was
blessed
with
the
sight
of
my
lover
;
and
having
concerted
measures
for
proceeding
to
England
,
I
hired
a
tall
fine
Liegeoise
for
a
maid
;
and
setting
out
for
Ostend
<EOS>
,
we
embarked
in
a
vessel
,
in
which
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
had
bespoke
our
passage
.
<EOS>
Our
voyage
was
short
and
prosperous
,
and
the
time
most
agreeably
spent
in
the
company
of
my
dear
partner
,
who
was
a
most
engaging
man
in
all
respects
,
as
I
dare
say
my
lady
O
#
#
#
#
has
since
found
him
.
    
<EOS>
I
assumed
a
fictitious
name
,
took
private
lodgings
in
Poland
-
street
,
retained
lawyers
,
and
commenced
a
suit
for
separation
against
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
communicated
the
reasons
of
my
elopement
to
my
father
,
who
was
shocked
and
surprised
at
my
conduct
,
which
he
condemned
with
expressions
of
sorrow
and
resentment
.
<EOS>
But
the
step
was
taken
;
nor
did
I
repent
of
what
I
had
done
,
except
on
his
account
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
morning
after
my
arrival
at
London
,
I
waited
upon
the
lord
-
chief
-
justice
,
to
whom
I
complained
of
the
usage
I
had
received
from
my
lord
,
whose
temper
was
teazing
,
tiresome
,
and
intolerably
capricious
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
was
a
strange
compound
of
madness
and
folly
,
seasoned
with
a
small
proportion
of
sense
:
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
that
I
,
who
am
hot
and
hasty
,
should
be
wretched
,
under
the
persecution
of
such
a
perverse
humourist
,
who
used
to
terrify
me
,
and
scold
at
me
the
whole
night
without
intermission
,
and
shake
my
pillow
from
time
to
time
,
that
I
might
not
sleep
,
while
he
tormented
me
with
his
disagreeable
expostulations
.
    
<EOS>
I
have
been
often
frightened
almost
out
of
my
senses
,
at
seeing
him
convulsed
by
the
most
unreasonable
passion
;
and
chagrined
to
the
highest
degree
of
disgust
,
to
find
(
by
repeated
observation
)
his
disposition
so
preposterous
,
that
his
satisfaction
and
displeasure
never
depended
upon
the
cause
he
had
to
be
satisfied
or
disobliged
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
when
he
had
most
reason
to
be
pleased
,
he
was
always
most
discontented
,
and
very
often
in
good
humour
,
when
he
had
reason
enough
for
vexation
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
lived
in
Poland
-
street
,
I
was
engaged
with
lawyers
,
and
so
often
visited
by
my
father
,
that
I
could
not
dedicate
my
whole
time
,
as
usual
,
to
my
lover
;
nor
was
it
convenient
that
he
should
be
seen
in
my
company
:
he
therefore
took
a
small
house
at
Camberwell
,
whither
<EOS>
I
went
as
often
as
I
had
an
opportunity
;
and
maintained
the
correspondence
with
such
eagerness
and
industry
,
that
although
I
was
six
months
gone
with
child
,
I
have
often
,
by
myself
,
set
out
for
his
habitation
,
in
an
hackney
-
coach
,
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
and
returned
by
six
in
the
morning
,
that
I
might
be
in
my
own
bed
,
when
my
father
came
to
see
me
;
for
I
concealed
my
amour
,
as
well
as
the
effects
of
it
,
from
his
knowledge
,
and
frequently
took
water
from
the
Bridge
,
that
my
motions
might
not
be
discovered
.
<EOS>
Nothing
but
the
most
passionate
love
could
have
supported
my
spirits
under
such
vicissitudes
of
fatigue
,
or
enabled
my
admirer
to
spend
whole
days
by
himself
,
in
such
a
solitary
retirement
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
my
lord
was
arrived
in
England
,
and
employed
in
discovering
the
place
of
my
retreat
;
so
that
I
lived
in
continual
alarm
,
and
provided
myself
with
a
speaking
-
trumpet
,
which
stood
by
my
bed
side
,
to
be
used
in
calling
for
assistance
,
in
case
my
pursuer
should
make
an
attack
upon
my
lodgings
.
    
<EOS>
This
situation
being
extremely
uncomfortable
<EOS>
I
had
no
sooner
begun
my
process
against
him
,
than
I
put
myself
intirely
under
the
protection
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
conducted
me
to
the
house
of
a
friend
of
his
who
lived
in
the
country
,
where
I
was
secure
from
the
attempts
of
my
husband
.
    
<EOS>
The
world
had
now
given
me
up
,
and
I
had
renounced
the
world
with
the
most
perfect
resignation
.
<EOS>
I
weighed
in
my
own
breast
what
I
should
lose
in
point
of
character
,
with
what
I
suffered
in
my
peace
at
home
,
and
found
,
that
my
reputation
was
not
to
be
preserved
,
except
at
the
expence
of
my
quiet
,
(
for
his
lordship
was
not
disposed
to
make
me
easy
,
had
I
been
never
so
discreet
.
)
<EOS>
I
therefore
determined
to
give
up
a
few
ceremonial
visits
,
and
empty
professions
,
for
the
more
substantial
enjoyments
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
We
passed
our
time
very
agreeably
,
in
various
amusements
,
with
this
friend
of
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
until
the
term
of
my
reckoning
was
almost
expired
,
then
returned
to
London
,
and
took
lodgings
in
Southampton
-
street
,
where
I
began
to
make
preparations
for
the
approaching
occasion
.
<EOS>
Here
I
proposed
to
live
with
the
utmost
circumspection
.
<EOS>
I
disguised
my
name
,
saw
nobody
but
my
lawyer
and
lover
,
and
never
approached
the
window
,
lest
I
should
be
discovered
by
accident
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
precautions
,
my
French
maid
,
whom
I
had
sent
for
some
of
my
cloaths
,
was
dogged
in
her
return
,
and
next
morning
my
lord
took
my
lodgings
by
storm
.
<EOS>
Had
he
given
the
assault
in
his
own
person
only
<EOS>
,
I
make
no
doubt
but
he
would
have
suffered
a
repulse
,
from
the
opposition
of
the
Ligeoise
,
who
made
all
the
resistance
in
her
power
,
but
was
obliged
to
give
way
to
superior
number
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
at
that
time
abed
,
and
hearing
an
unusual
noise
below
,
rung
my
bell
,
in
order
to
know
the
cause
of
such
disturbance
.
<EOS>
I
drew
my
curtain
at
the
same
time
,
and
who
should
I
see
entering
my
chamber
but
his
lordship
,
attended
by
a
constable
,
and
the
footman
who
had
detected
my
retreat
!
    
<EOS>
Such
an
unexpected
visit
could
not
fail
to
affect
me
with
surprize
and
consternation
:
however
,
I
summoned
all
my
fortitude
to
my
aid
,
and
perceiving
the
fellows
were
about
to
open
my
window
-
shutters
,
desired
their
principal
to
order
them
down
stairs
.
<EOS>
He
readily
complied
with
my
request
,
and
sitting
down
by
my
bed
-
side
,
told
me
with
an
air
of
triumph
,
that
he
had
found
me
at
last
;
and
I
frankly
owned
,
that
I
was
heartily
sorry
for
his
success
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
upbraiding
me
with
my
escape
,
he
proceeded
to
entertain
me
with
all
the
news
in
town
,
and
gave
me
a
minute
detail
of
every
thing
which
had
happened
to
him
since
our
parting
;
among
other
articles
of
intelligence
,
giving
me
to
understand
,
that
he
had
challenged
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
refused
to
fight
him
,
and
was
in
disgrace
with
the
prince
of
W
#
#
#
#
on
that
account
.
    
<EOS>
But
here
his
lordship
did
not
strictly
adhere
to
the
naked
truth
:
he
had
indeed
,
before
our
departure
for
the
country
,
gone
to
my
lover
,
and
insisted
upon
having
satisfaction
in
Hyde
-
park
,
two
days
from
the
date
of
his
demand
,
and
at
three
o
'
clock
in
the
afternoon
;
S
#
#
#
#
believing
him
in
earnest
,
accepted
the
invitation
;
though
he
observed
,
that
these
affairs
could
not
be
discussed
too
soon
,
and
wished
the
time
of
meeting
might
be
at
an
earlier
hour
.
    
<EOS>
But
his
lordship
did
not
choose
to
alter
the
circumstances
of
his
first
proposal
;
and
when
he
went
away
,
said
he
should
expect
him
at
the
appointed
time
and
place
,
if
it
did
not
rain
.
    
<EOS>
His
antagonist
gave
me
an
account
of
the
conversation
,
when
I
assured
him
the
whole
business
would
end
in
smoke
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
my
lord
sent
him
a
letter
on
Monday
,
desiring
that
the
assignation
might
be
deferred
till
Thursday
,
that
he
might
have
time
to
settle
his
affairs
,
and
pay
S
#
#
#
#
an
hundred
pounds
,
which
he
had
formerly
borrowed
of
him
.
<EOS>
When
Thursday
came
,
he
was
favoured
with
another
epistle
,
importing
,
that
the
challenger
had
changed
his
mind
,
and
would
seek
satisfaction
at
law
.
<EOS>
Thus
ended
that
heroic
exploit
,
which
his
lordship
now
boasted
of
with
such
arrogant
misrepresentation
.
    
<EOS>
Whilst
he
regaled
me
with
these
interesting
particulars
,
I
was
contriving
a
scheme
to
frustrate
the
discovery
he
had
made
;
so
that
I
did
not
contradict
his
assertions
,
but
told
him
,
that
if
he
would
go
down
stairs
,
I
would
rise
and
come
to
breakfast
.
<EOS>
He
consented
to
this
proposal
with
great
chearfulness
;
and
I
own
,
I
was
not
a
little
surprized
to
find
him
,
at
this
first
interview
,
in
as
good
humour
,
as
if
nothing
had
happened
to
interrupt
the
felicity
of
our
matrimonial
union
.
    
<EOS>
It
cost
me
some
invention
to
conceal
my
condition
from
his
notice
,
being
now
within
a
week
of
the
expected
crisis
:
<EOS>
but
I
knew
I
had
to
do
with
a
man
of
no
great
penetration
,
and
succeeded
in
my
attempt
accordingly
.
<EOS>
We
breakfasted
with
great
harmony
,
and
I
invited
him
to
dinner
,
after
having
prevailed
upon
him
to
send
away
his
myrmidons
,
whom
,
nevertheless
,
he
ordered
to
return
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
We
conversed
together
with
great
gaiety
and
mirth
;
and
when
I
rallied
him
for
visiting
me
in
such
a
dishabille
,
he
stood
a
tiptoe
to
view
himself
in
the
glass
;
and
owning
I
was
in
the
right
,
said
he
would
go
and
dress
himself
before
dinner
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
went
away
,
charging
my
maid
to
give
him
entrance
at
his
return
;
and
he
was
no
sooner
gone
than
I
wrote
to
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
giving
him
an
account
of
what
had
happened
;
then
,
without
having
determined
upon
any
certain
plan
,
huddled
on
my
cloaths
,
muffled
myself
up
,
and
calling
a
chair
,
went
to
the
next
tavern
,
where
I
stayed
no
longer
than
was
sufficient
to
change
my
vehicle
;
and
,
to
the
astonishment
of
the
drawers
,
who
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
my
perturbation
,
proceeded
to
a
shop
in
the
neighbourhood
,
where
I
dismissed
my
second
chair
,
and
procured
an
hackney
coach
,
in
which
I
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
my
lawyer
,
whom
I
could
trust
.
<EOS>
Having
made
him
acquainted
with
the
circumstances
of
my
distress
,
and
consulted
him
about
a
proper
place
of
retreat
,
after
some
recollection
he
directed
me
to
a
little
house
in
a
court
,
to
which
,
by
the
assistance
,
of
my
lover
,
my
woman
and
cloaths
were
safely
conveyed
that
same
evening
.
    
<EOS>
My
lord
,
however
,
came
to
dinner
,
according
to
invitation
,
and
did
not
seem
at
all
alarmed
when
my
maid
told
him
I
was
gone
,
but
stepped
to
my
lawyer
,
to
know
if
he
thought
I
should
return
;
and
upon
his
answering
in
the
affirmative
,
and
advising
his
lordship
to
go
back
in
the
mean
time
,
and
eat
the
dinner
I
had
provided
,
he
very
deliberately
took
his
advice
,
made
a
very
hearty
meal
,
drank
his
bottle
of
wine
,
and
,
as
I
did
not
return
,
according
to
his
expectation
,
withdrew
,
in
order
to
consult
his
associates
.
    
<EOS>
This
motion
of
his
furnished
my
woman
with
an
opportunity
of
making
her
retreat
;
and
when
he
returned
at
night
,
the
coast
was
clear
,
and
he
found
no
body
in
the
house
but
a
porter
,
who
had
been
left
to
take
care
of
the
furniture
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
enraged
at
this
disappointment
,
that
he
made
a
furious
noise
,
which
raised
the
whole
neighbourhood
,
reinforced
his
crew
with
the
authority
of
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
tarried
in
the
street
till
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
discharged
a
lodging
he
had
hired
at
a
barber
's
shop
,
opposite
to
the
house
from
which
I
had
escaped
,
and
retired
with
the
comfortable
reflexion
of
having
done
every
thing
which
man
could
do
to
retrieve
me
.
    
<EOS>
The
hurry
of
spirits
,
and
surprize
I
had
undergone
in
effecting
this
retreat
,
produced
such
a
disorder
in
my
constitution
,
that
I
began
to
fear
I
should
be
delivered
before
I
could
be
provided
with
necessaries
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
I
signified
my
apprehension
to
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
with
infinite
care
and
concern
endeavoured
to
find
a
more
convenient
place
;
and
,
after
all
his
inquiries
,
was
obliged
to
fix
upon
a
paultry
apartment
in
the
city
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
tenderness
was
extremely
shocked
at
the
necessity
of
choosing
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
no
remedy
,
nor
time
to
be
lost
:
to
this
miserable
habitation
I
was
carried
in
an
hackney
coach
;
and
,
tho
'
extremely
ill
,
bore
my
fate
with
spirit
and
resignation
,
in
testimony
of
my
sincere
and
indelible
attachment
to
my
lover
,
for
whose
ease
and
pleasure
I
could
have
suffered
every
inconvenience
,
and
even
sacrificed
my
life
.
    
<EOS>
Immediately
after
I
had
taken
possession
of
my
wretched
apartment
,
I
was
constrained
by
my
indisposition
to
go
to
bed
,
and
send
for
the
necessary
help
;
and
in
a
few
hours
a
living
pledge
of
my
love
and
indiscretion
saw
the
light
,
tho
'
the
terrors
and
fatigue
<EOS>
I
had
undergone
had
affected
this
little
innocent
so
severely
,
that
it
scarce
discovered
any
visible
signs
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
My
grief
at
this
misfortune
was
inexpressible
:
I
forthwith
dispatched
a
message
to
the
dear
,
the
anxious
father
,
who
flew
to
my
arms
,
and
shared
my
sorrow
,
with
all
the
gentleness
of
love
and
parental
fondness
;
yet
our
fears
were
happily
disappointed
by
the
recovery
of
our
infant
daughter
,
who
was
committed
to
the
charge
of
a
nurse
in
the
neighbourhood
;
so
that
I
could
every
day
be
satisfied
in
my
inquiries
about
her
health
.
<EOS>
Thus
I
continued
a
whole
fortnight
,
in
a
state
of
happiness
and
tranquillity
,
being
blessed
with
the
conversation
and
tender
offices
of
my
admirer
,
whose
love
and
attention
I
wholly
ingrossed
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
gave
up
all
business
and
amusement
,
and
concentred
all
his
care
and
assiduity
in
ministring
to
my
ease
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
And
sure
I
had
no
cause
to
regret
what
I
had
suffered
on
his
account
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
my
agreeable
situation
was
one
day
disturbed
by
a
most
alarming
accident
,
by
which
my
life
was
drawn
into
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
The
room
under
my
bed
-
chamber
took
fire
;
I
immediately
smelled
it
,
and
saw
the
people
about
me
in
the
utmost
perplexity
and
consternation
,
tho
'
they
would
not
own
the
true
cause
of
their
confusion
,
lest
my
health
should
suffer
in
the
fright
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
I
was
so
calm
in
my
inquiries
,
that
they
ventured
to
tell
me
my
suspicion
was
but
<EOS>
too
just
:
upon
which
I
gave
such
directions
as
I
thought
would
secure
me
from
catching
cold
,
in
case
there
should
be
a
necessity
for
removing
me
;
but
the
fire
being
happily
extinguished
,
I
escaped
that
ceremony
,
which
might
have
cost
me
my
life
.
<EOS>
Indeed
it
was
surprising
,
that
the
agitation
of
my
spirits
did
not
produce
some
fatal
effect
upon
my
constitution
;
and
I
looked
upon
my
deliverance
as
the
protection
of
a
particular
providence
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
I
escaped
the
hazard
of
a
sudden
removal
,
I
found
it
was
high
time
to
change
my
lodgings
,
because
the
neighbours
rushing
into
the
house
,
upon
the
alarm
of
fire
,
had
discovered
my
situation
,
though
they
were
ignorant
of
my
name
;
and
I
did
not
think
myself
safe
,
in
being
the
subject
of
their
conjectures
.
<EOS>
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
therefore
procured
another
apartment
,
with
better
accommodation
,
to
which
I
was
carried
,
as
soon
as
my
health
would
admit
of
my
removal
;
and
soon
after
my
lord
wrote
to
me
,
by
the
hands
of
my
lawyer
,
earnestly
intreating
me
to
drop
my
prosecution
,
and
come
home
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
not
comply
with
his
request
;
and
nothing
was
farther
from
my
intention
than
the
desire
of
receiving
any
favours
at
his
hands
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
repulsed
,
he
set
on
foot
a
most
accurate
search
for
my
person
;
in
the
course
of
which
he
is
said
to
have
detected
several
ladies
and
young
girls
,
who
had
reasons
for
keeping
themselves
concealed
;
and
had
like
to
have
been
very
severely
handled
for
his
impertinent
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
Being
unsuccessful
in
all
his
attempts
,
he
entered
into
treaty
with
one
Sir
R
#
#
#
#
H
#
#
#
#
,
a
person
of
a
very
indifferent
character
,
who
undertook
to
furnish
him
with
an
infallible
expedient
to
discover
the
place
of
my
abode
,
if
he
would
gratify
him
with
a
bond
for
a
thousand
pounds
;
which
being
executed
accordingly
,
this
worthy
knight
advertised
me
and
my
maid
in
the
public
papers
,
offering
one
hundred
pounds
as
a
reward
to
any
person
who
should
disclose
the
place
of
our
retirement
.
    
<EOS>
As
soon
as
the
paper
fell
into
my
hands
I
was
again
involved
in
perplexity
;
and
being
afraid
of
staying
in
town
,
resolved
,
with
the
concurrence
of
my
lover
,
to
accept
of
an
invitation
I
had
received
from
the
duke
of
K
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
by
this
time
arrived
in
England
,
with
that
lady
whom
I
have
already
mentioned
,
as
one
of
our
parties
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
Having
visited
my
little
infant
,
I
next
day
set
out
for
the
duke
's
country
-
seat
,
which
is
a
most
elegant
chateau
,
and
stands
in
a
charming
situation
:
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
followed
in
a
few
days
;
we
met
with
a
very
cordial
reception
;
his
grace
was
civil
and
good
-
natured
,
lived
nobly
and
loved
pleasure
;
Madam
la
T
#
#
#
#
was
formed
to
please
:
there
was
always
a
great
deal
of
good
company
in
the
house
;
so
that
we
passed
our
time
agreeably
in
playing
at
billiards
and
cards
,
hunting
,
walking
,
reading
and
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
But
my
terms
of
happiness
were
generally
of
short
duration
.
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
all
this
felicity
I
was
overtaken
by
a
most
severe
affliction
,
in
the
death
of
my
dear
hapless
infant
,
who
had
ingrossed
a
greater
share
of
my
tenderness
than
perhaps
I
even
should
have
paid
to
the
offspring
of
a
legitimate
contract
,
because
the
circumstance
of
her
birth
would
have
been
an
unsurmountable
misfortune
to
her
thro
'
the
whole
course
of
her
life
,
and
rendered
her
absolutely
dependent
on
my
love
and
protection
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
still
lamented
the
untimely
fate
of
this
fair
blossom
,
lord
   
came
down
,
and
demanded
me
as
his
wife
;
but
the
suit
which
I
then
maintained
against
him
deprived
him
,
for
the
present
,
of
an
husband
's
right
;
and
therefore
the
duke
would
not
deliver
me
into
his
hands
.
    
<EOS>
In
six
months
he
repeated
his
visit
and
demand
;
and
an
agreement
was
patched
up
,
in
consequence
of
which
I
consented
to
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
,
on
condition
that
he
should
never
desire
to
sleep
with
me
,
or
take
any
other
measure
to
disturb
my
peace
;
otherwise
I
should
be
at
liberty
to
leave
him
again
,
and
intitled
to
the
provision
of
a
separate
maintenance
.
<EOS>
To
these
articles
I
assented
,
by
the
advice
of
my
lawyers
,
with
a
view
of
obtaining
the
payment
of
my
pin
-
money
,
which
I
had
never
received
since
our
parting
,
but
subsisted
on
the
sale
of
my
jewels
,
which
were
very
considerable
,
and
had
been
presented
to
me
with
full
power
of
alienation
.
<EOS>
As
to
my
lover
,
he
had
no
fortune
to
support
me
;
and
for
that
reason
I
was
scrupulously
cautious
of
augmenting
his
expence
.
    
<EOS>
We
had
now
enjoyed
each
other
's
company
for
three
years
,
during
which
our
mutual
passion
had
suffered
no
abatement
,
nor
had
my
happiness
been
mixed
with
any
considerable
allay
,
except
that
late
stroke
of
providence
which
I
have
already
mentioned
,
and
the
reflexion
of
the
sorrow
that
my
conduct
had
intailed
upon
my
dear
father
,
whom
I
loved
beyond
expression
,
and
whom
nothing
could
have
compelled
me
to
disoblige
but
a
more
powerful
flame
,
that
prevailed
over
every
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
As
I
was
now
forced
to
break
off
this
inchanting
correspondence
,
it
is
not
to
be
doubted
that
our
parting
cost
us
the
most
acute
sensations
of
grief
and
disappointment
.
<EOS>
However
,
there
was
no
remedy
:
    
I
tore
myself
from
his
arms
,
took
my
leave
of
the
family
,
after
having
acknowledged
my
obligations
to
the
duke
,
and
set
out
for
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
I
was
met
by
my
lord
,
attended
by
a
steward
whom
he
had
lately
engaged
,
and
who
was
one
chief
cause
of
our
future
separations
.
<EOS>
My
lord
having
quitted
his
house
in
town
,
conducted
me
to
his
lodgings
in
Pall
-
Mall
,
and
insisted
upon
sleeping
with
me
the
first
night
;
but
I
refused
to
gratify
his
desire
,
on
the
authority
of
our
agreement
.
    
<EOS>
This
dispute
produced
a
quarrel
,
in
consequence
of
which
I
attempted
to
leave
the
house
;
and
he
endeavouring
to
prevent
my
retreat
,
I
fairly
locked
him
in
,
ran
down
stairs
,
and
calling
a
hackney
coach
,
made
the
best
of
my
way
into
the
city
,
to
my
father
's
lodgings
,
where
I
lay
,
the
family
being
in
town
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
himself
was
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
him
immediately
,
and
when
he
came
to
London
,
declared
my
intention
of
separating
from
my
lord
,
with
which
,
seeing
me
obstinate
and
determined
,
he
at
length
acquiesced
,
and
a
formal
separation
accordingly
ensued
,
which
at
that
time
I
thought
binding
and
immutable
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
now
sheltered
under
the
wings
of
an
indulgent
father
,
who
had
taken
me
into
favour
again
,
on
the
supposition
that
my
commerce
with
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
was
absolutely
at
an
end
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
tho
'
we
had
separated
,
in
all
appearance
,
for
ever
,
we
had
previously
agreed
to
maintain
our
correspondence
in
private
interviews
,
which
should
escape
the
notice
of
the
world
,
with
which
I
was
again
obliged
to
keep
some
measures
.
    
<EOS>
Our
parting
at
the
duke
of
K
#
#
#
#
's
house
in
the
country
was
attended
with
all
the
genuine
marks
of
sincere
and
reciprocal
affection
,
and
I
lived
in
the
sweet
hope
of
seeing
him
again
,
in
all
the
transport
of
his
former
passion
,
when
my
lawyer
,
who
received
my
letters
,
brought
me
a
billet
one
night
,
just
as
I
had
gone
to
bed
.
<EOS>
Seeing
the
superscription
of
S
#
#
#
#
's
hand
-
writing
,
I
opened
it
with
all
the
impatience
of
an
absent
lover
;
but
how
shall
I
describe
the
astonishment
and
consternation
with
which
I
was
seized
,
when
I
perused
the
contents
!
<EOS>
Instead
of
the
most
tender
vows
and
protestations
,
this
fatal
epistle
began
with
,
Madam
,
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
return
to
your
father
;
or
some
cold
and
killing
expression
,
to
that
effect
.
    
<EOS>
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
what
did
I
feel
at
this
dire
conjuncture
!
<EOS>
The
light
forsook
my
eyes
,
a
cold
sweat
bedewed
my
limbs
,
and
I
was
overwhelmed
with
such
a
torrent
of
sorrow
and
surprize
,
that
every
body
present
believed
I
would
have
died
under
the
violent
agitation
.
<EOS>
They
endeavoured
to
support
my
spirits
with
repeated
draughts
of
strong
liquor
,
which
had
no
sensible
effect
upon
my
constitution
,
tho
'
for
eight
whole
years
<EOS>
I
had
drank
nothing
stronger
than
water
;
and
I
must
have
infallibly
perished
in
the
first
extasy
of
my
grief
,
had
it
not
made
its
way
in
a
fit
of
tears
and
exclamation
,
in
which
I
continued
all
night
,
to
the
amazement
of
the
family
,
whom
my
condition
had
alarmed
,
and
raised
from
their
repose
.
<EOS>
My
father
was
the
only
person
who
guessed
the
cause
of
my
affliction
;
he
said
he
was
sure
I
had
received
some
ill
usage
in
a
letter
or
message
from
that
rascal
S
#
#
#
#
(
so
he
termed
him
in
the
bitterness
of
passion
)
.
    
<EOS>
At
mention
of
that
name
my
agony
redoubled
to
such
a
degree
,
that
all
who
were
present
wept
at
sight
of
my
deplorable
condition
.
    
<EOS>
My
poor
father
shed
a
flood
of
tears
,
and
conjured
me
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
my
disquiet
:
upon
which
,
rather
than
confess
the
truth
,
I
amused
his
concern
,
by
pretending
that
my
lover
was
ill
.
<EOS>
The
whole
family
having
stayed
by
me
till
I
was
a
little
more
composed
,
left
me
to
the
care
of
my
maid
,
who
put
me
into
bed
about
six
in
the
morning
;
but
I
enjoyed
no
rest
<EOS>
:
I
revolved
every
circumstance
of
my
conduct
,
endeavouring
to
find
out
the
cause
of
this
fatal
change
in
S
#
#
#
#
's
disposition
;
and
as
I
could
recollect
nothing
which
could
justly
give
offence
,
concluded
that
some
malicious
persons
had
abused
his
ears
with
stories
to
my
prejudice
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
conjecture
I
got
up
,
and
sent
my
lawyer
to
him
with
a
letter
,
wherein
I
insisted
upon
seeing
him
,
that
I
might
have
an
opportunity
of
justifying
myself
in
person
;
a
task
which
would
be
easily
performed
,
as
I
had
never
offended
,
but
in
loving
too
well
.
<EOS>
I
waited
with
the
most
anxious
impatience
for
the
return
of
my
messenger
,
who
brought
me
an
answer
couched
in
the
coldest
terms
of
civility
which
indifference
could
dictate
;
acknowledging
,
however
,
that
he
had
nothing
to
lay
to
my
charge
,
but
that
it
was
for
the
good
of
us
both
we
should
part
.
  
<EOS>
He
ought
to
have
reflected
on
that
before
,
not
after
I
had
sacrificed
my
all
for
his
love
!
<EOS>
I
was
well
nigh
distracted
by
this
confirmation
of
his
inconstancy
;
and
I
wonder
to
this
day
how
I
retained
the
use
of
reason
,
under
such
circumstances
of
horror
and
despair
!
<EOS>
My
grief
laid
aside
all
decorum
and
restraint
;
I
told
my
father
that
S
#
#
#
#
was
dying
,
and
that
I
would
visit
him
with
all
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Startled
at
the
proposal
,
this
careful
parent
demonstrated
the
fatal
consequence
of
such
an
unguarded
step
,
reminded
me
of
the
difficulty
with
which
he
had
prevailed
upon
my
mother
and
uncle
to
forgive
my
former
imprudence
,
observed
that
his
intention
was
to
carry
me
into
the
country
next
day
,
in
order
to
effect
a
perfect
reconciliation
;
but
now
I
was
on
the
brink
of
forfeiting
all
pretensions
to
their
regard
,
by
committing
another
fatal
error
,
which
could
not
possibly
be
retrieved
;
and
that
for
his
part
,
whatever
pangs
it
might
cost
him
,
he
was
resolved
to
banish
me
from
his
sight
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
uttered
this
declaration
the
tears
trickled
down
his
cheeks
,
and
he
seemed
overwhelmed
with
the
keenest
sorrow
and
mortification
;
so
it
may
be
easily
conceived
what
were
the
impressions
of
my
grief
,
reinforced
with
the
affliction
of
a
father
whom
I
dearly
loved
,
and
the
consciousness
of
being
the
cause
of
all
his
disquiet
!
<EOS>
I
was
struck
dumb
with
remorse
and
woe
;
and
when
I
recovered
the
use
of
speech
,
I
told
him
how
sensible
I
was
of
his
great
goodness
and
humanity
,
and
owned
how
little
I
deserved
his
favour
and
affection
;
that
the
sense
of
my
own
unworthiness
was
one
cause
of
my
present
distraction
;
for
such
was
the
condition
of
my
fate
,
that
I
must
either
see
S
#
#
#
#
or
die
.
<EOS>
I
said
,
tho
<EOS>
'
I
could
not
expect
his
forgiveness
,
I
was
surely
worthy
of
his
compassion
;
that
nothing
but
the
most
irresistible
passion
could
have
misled
me
at
first
from
my
duty
,
or
tempted
me
to
incur
the
least
degree
of
his
displeasure
;
that
the
same
fatal
influence
still
prevailed
,
and
would
,
in
all
probability
,
continue
to
the
grave
,
which
was
the
only
abode
in
which
I
hoped
for
peace
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
expressed
myself
in
this
manner
,
my
dear
good
father
wept
with
the
most
tender
sympathy
,
and
saying
I
might
do
as
I
pleased
,
for
he
had
done
with
me
,
quitted
the
room
,
leaving
me
to
the
cruel
sensations
of
my
own
heart
,
which
almost
bursted
with
anguish
,
upbraiding
me
with
a
fault
which
I
could
not
help
committing
.
    
<EOS>
I
immediately
hired
a
chariot
and
six
,
and
would
have
set
out
by
myself
,
had
not
my
father
's
affection
,
which
all
my
errors
could
not
efface
,
provided
an
attendant
.
<EOS>
He
saw
me
quite
delirious
and
desperate
;
and
therefore
engaged
a
relation
of
my
own
to
accompany
and
take
care
of
me
in
this
rash
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
During
this
journey
,
which
lasted
two
days
,
I
felt
no
remission
of
grief
and
anxiety
,
but
underwent
the
most
intolerable
sorrow
and
suspense
:
at
last
we
arrived
at
a
little
house
called
the
Hut
,
on
Salisbury
<EOS>
plain
,
where
,
in
the
most
frantic
agitation
,
I
wrote
a
letter
to
S
#
#
#
#
,
describing
the
miserable
condition
to
which
I
was
reduced
by
his
unkindness
,
and
desiring
to
see
him
,
with
the
most
earnest
sollicitations
.
    
<EOS>
This
billet
I
committed
to
the
care
of
my
attendant
,
and
laid
strong
injunctions
upon
him
to
tell
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
my
injuries
were
so
great
,
and
my
despair
so
violent
,
that
if
he
did
not
favour
me
with
a
visit
,
I
would
go
to
him
,
though
at
his
sister
's
house
,
where
he
then
was
.
    
<EOS>
He
received
my
message
with
great
coldness
,
and
told
my
friend
,
that
if
I
would
return
to
London
,
without
insisting
upon
the
interview
I
demanded
,
he
would
in
a
little
time
follow
me
to
town
,
and
every
thing
should
be
amicably
adjusted
.
    
<EOS>
But
when
the
messenger
assured
him
,
that
I
was
too
much
transported
with
grief
,
to
hear
of
such
a
proposal
,
he
consented
to
meet
me
in
the
middle
of
Salisbury
-
plain
,
that
we
might
avoid
all
observation
:
and
though
I
was
little
able
to
walk
,
I
set
out
on
foot
for
the
place
of
assignation
,
<EOS>
my
companion
following
at
a
small
distance
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
saw
him
leading
his
horse
down
the
hill
,
I
collected
all
my
fortitude
,
and
advanced
to
him
with
all
the
speed
I
could
exert
;
but
when
I
made
an
effort
to
speak
,
my
tongue
denied
its
office
;
and
so
lively
was
the
expression
of
unutterable
sorrow
in
my
countenance
,
<EOS>
that
his
heart
(
hard
as
it
was
)
melted
at
sight
of
my
sufferings
,
which
he
well
knew
proceeded
from
the
sincerity
of
my
love
.
<EOS>
At
length
I
recovered
the
use
of
speech
,
enough
to
tell
him
,
that
I
was
come
to
take
my
leave
;
and
when
I
would
have
proceeded
,
my
voice
failed
me
again
:
but
,
after
a
considerable
pause
,
I
found
means
,
with
great
difficulty
,
to
let
him
know
how
sensible
I
was
of
my
own
incapacity
to
retrieve
his
lost
affections
;
but
that
I
was
willing
(
if
possible
)
to
retain
his
esteem
,
of
which
,
could
I
be
assured
,
I
would
endeavour
to
compose
myself
;
that
I
was
determined
to
leave
the
kingdom
,
because
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
those
places
where
we
had
been
so
happy
in
our
mutual
love
;
and
that
,
till
my
departure
,
I
hoped
he
would
visit
me
sometimes
,
that
I
might
,
by
degrees
,
wean
myself
from
his
company
;
for
,
I
should
not
be
able
to
survive
the
shock
of
being
deprived
of
him
all
at
once
.
    
<EOS>
This
address
may
seem
very
humble
to
an
unconcerned
observer
;
but
love
will
tame
the
proudest
disposition
,
as
plainly
appeared
in
my
case
;
for
I
had
naturally
as
much
spirit
,
or
more
,
than
the
generality
of
people
have
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
was
so
much
confounded
at
the
manner
of
my
behaviour
,
that
he
scarce
knew
what
answer
to
make
;
for
(
as
he
afterwards
owned
)
he
expected
to
hear
himself
upbraided
;
but
he
was
not
proof
against
my
tenderness
.
<EOS>
After
some
hesitation
,
he
said
he
never
meant
to
forsake
me
intirely
,
that
his
affection
was
still
unimpaired
,
and
that
he
would
follow
me
directly
to
London
.
<EOS>
I
imposed
upon
myself
,
and
believed
what
he
said
,
because
I
could
not
bear
to
think
of
parting
with
him
for
ever
,
and
returned
to
town
in
a
more
tranquil
state
of
mind
than
that
in
which
I
had
left
my
father
,
though
my
heart
was
far
from
being
at
ease
;
my
fears
being
ingenious
enough
to
foresee
,
that
I
should
never
be
able
to
overcome
his
indifference
.
    
<EOS>
I
took
lodgings
in
Mount
-
street
,
and
my
maid
having
disposed
of
herself
in
marriage
,
hired
another
,
who
supplied
her
place
very
much
to
my
satisfaction
;
she
was
a
good
girl
,
had
a
particular
attachment
to
me
,
and
for
many
years
,
during
which
she
lived
in
my
service
,
was
indefatigably
assiduous
in
contributing
to
my
ease
,
or
rather
,
in
alleviating
my
affliction
:
for
,
though
S
#
#
#
#
came
up
to
town
according
to
promise
,
and
renewed
a
sort
of
correspondence
with
me
for
the
space
of
five
months
,
his
complaisance
would
extend
no
farther
;
and
he
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
he
had
determined
to
go
abroad
with
Mr
V
#
#
#
#
,
whom
he
accordingly
accompanied
in
his
envoyship
to
D####n
.
    
<EOS>
I
understood
the
real
cause
of
this
expedition
,
which
,
notwithstanding
his
oaths
and
protestations
of
unabated
love
and
regard
,
I
construed
into
a
palpable
mark
of
dislike
and
disrespect
;
not
could
the
repeated
assurances
I
received
from
him
in
letters
,
mitigate
the
anguish
and
mortification
that
preyed
upon
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
therefore
gave
up
all
hopes
of
recovering
the
happiness
I
had
lost
:
I
told
him
,
on
the
eve
of
his
departure
,
that
he
might
exercise
his
gallantry
a
great
while
,
before
he
would
meet
with
my
fellow
,
in
point
of
sincerity
and
love
;
for
I
would
rather
have
been
a
servant
in
his
house
,
with
the
privilege
of
seeing
him
,
than
the
queen
of
England
,
debarred
of
that
pleasure
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
took
his
leave
,
and
went
down
stairs
,
I
shrunk
at
every
step
he
made
,
as
if
a
new
wound
had
been
inflicted
upon
me
;
and
when
I
heard
the
door
shut
behind
him
,
my
heart
died
within
me
.
<EOS>
(
I
had
the
satisfaction
to
hear
afterwards
<EOS>
,
he
lamented
the
loss
of
me
prodigiously
,
and
that
he
had
never
been
so
happy
since
.
)
<EOS>
I
sat
down
to
write
a
letter
,
in
which
I
forgave
his
indifference
,
because
I
knew
the
affections
are
altogether
involuntary
,
and
wished
him
all
the
happiness
he
deserved
.
<EOS>
I
then
walked
up
and
down
the
room
in
the
most
restless
anxiety
,
was
put
to
bed
by
my
maid
,
rose
at
six
,
mounted
my
horse
,
and
rode
forty
miles
,
in
order
to
fatigue
myself
,
that
I
might
,
next
night
,
enjoy
some
repose
.
<EOS>
This
exercise
I
daily
underwent
for
months
together
;
and
when
it
did
not
answer
my
purpose
,
I
used
to
walk
round
Hydepark
in
the
evening
,
when
the
place
was
quite
solitary
,
and
unvisited
by
any
other
human
creature
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
melancholy
perambulation
,
I
was
one
day
accosted
by
a
very
great
man
,
who
,
after
the
first
salutation
,
asked
whether
or
not
my
intercourse
with
S
#
#
#
#
was
at
an
end
;
and
if
I
had
any
allowance
from
my
husband
?
    
<EOS>
To
the
first
of
these
questions
I
replied
in
the
affirmative
;
and
to
the
last
answered
,
that
my
lord
did
not
allow
me
a
great
deal
;
indeed
I
might
have
truly
said
,
nothing
at
all
:
<EOS>
but
I
was
too
proud
to
own
my
indigence
.
<EOS>
He
then
expressed
his
wonder
,
how
one
like
me
,
who
had
been
used
to
splendor
and
affluence
from
my
cradle
,
could
make
shift
to
live
in
my
present
narrow
circumstances
;
and
when
I
told
him
that
I
could
make
a
very
good
shift
,
so
I
had
peace
,
he
seemed
to
lament
my
situation
,
and
very
kindly
invited
me
to
sup
with
his
wife
,
at
his
house
.
<EOS>
I
accepted
the
invitation
,
without
any
apprehension
of
the
consequence
;
and
when
I
went
to
the
place
,
was
introduced
into
an
apartment
,
magnificently
lighted
up
(
I
suppose
)
for
my
reception
.
    
<EOS>
After
I
had
stayed
alone
for
some
time
in
this
mysterious
situation
,
without
seeing
a
living
soul
,
my
inviter
appeared
,
and
said
,
he
hoped
I
would
not
take
it
amiss
,
that
he
and
I
were
to
sup
by
ourselves
,
as
he
had
something
to
say
,
which
could
not
be
so
properly
communicated
before
company
or
servants
.
<EOS>
I
then
,
for
the
first
time
,
perceived
his
drift
,
to
my
no
small
surprize
and
indignation
;
and
with
evident
marks
of
displeasure
told
him
,
I
was
sure
he
had
nothing
to
propose
that
would
be
agreeable
to
my
inclination
,
and
that
I
would
immediately
leave
the
house
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
he
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
I
could
not
possibly
retire
,
because
he
had
sent
away
my
chair
,
and
all
his
servants
were
disposed
to
obey
his
orders
.
    
<EOS>
Incensed
at
this
declaration
,
which
I
considered
as
an
insult
,
I
answered
with
an
air
of
resolution
,
it
was
very
well
;
I
despised
his
contrivance
,
and
was
afraid
of
nobody
.
<EOS>
Seeing
me
,
thus
alarmed
,
he
assured
me
I
had
no
reason
to
be
afraid
;
that
he
had
loved
me
long
,
and
could
find
no
other
opportunity
of
declaring
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
the
Q
#
#
#
#
had
told
him
,
that
lord
C
#
#
#
#
had
renewed
his
addresses
to
me
;
and
as
he
understood
from
my
own
mouth
,
my
correspondence
with
S
#
#
#
#
was
absolutely
broke
off
,
he
thought
himself
as
well
intitled
as
another
to
my
regard
.
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
he
told
me
,
that
I
might
command
his
purse
,
and
that
he
had
power
enough
to
bring
me
into
the
world
again
with
eclat
.
<EOS>
To
these
advances
I
replied
,
that
he
was
very
much
mistaken
in
his
opinion
of
my
character
,
if
he
imagined
I
was
to
be
won
by
any
temptations
of
fortune
,
and
very
frankly
declared
,
that
I
would
rather
give
myself
to
a
footman
,
than
sell
myself
to
a
prince
.
    
<EOS>
Supper
being
served
,
we
sat
down
together
;
but
I
would
neither
eat
nor
drink
any
thing
,
except
a
little
bread
and
water
;
for
I
was
an
odd
whimsical
girl
;
and
it
came
into
my
head
,
that
he
might
,
perhaps
,
have
mixed
something
in
the
victuals
or
wine
,
which
would
alter
my
way
of
thinking
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
finding
himself
baffled
in
all
his
endeavours
,
he
permitted
me
,
about
twelve
o'clock
,
to
depart
in
peace
,
and
gave
up
his
suit
,
as
a
desperate
cause
.
    
<EOS>
This
uncomfortable
life
did
I
lead
for
a
whole
twelvemonth
,
without
feeling
the
least
abatement
of
my
melancholy
;
and
finding
myself
worn
to
a
skeleton
,
I
resumed
my
former
resolution
of
trying
to
profit
by
change
of
place
,
and
actually
went
abroad
with
no
other
attendant
but
my
woman
,
and
the
utmost
indifference
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
My
intention
was
to
have
gone
to
the
South
of
France
,
where
I
thought
I
could
have
subsisted
on
the
little
I
had
left
,
which
amounted
to
five
hundred
pounds
,
until
the
issue
of
my
law
-
suit
,
by
which
I
hoped
to
obtain
some
provision
from
my
lord
;
and
,
without
all
doubt
,
my
expectation
would
have
been
answered
,
had
I
put
this
my
plan
in
execution
:
but
being
at
Paris
,
<EOS>
from
whence
I
purposed
to
set
forward
in
a
few
days
,
I
sent
to
Mr
K
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
been
formerly
intimate
with
my
father
,
and
shewn
me
many
civilities
during
my
first
residence
in
France
.
    
<EOS>
This
gentleman
favoured
me
with
a
visit
,
and
when
I
made
him
acquainted
with
my
scheme
,
dissuaded
me
from
it
,
as
an
uncomfortable
determination
,
and
advised
me
to
stay
at
Paris
,
where
,
with
good
oeconomy
,
I
could
live
as
cheap
as
in
any
other
place
,
and
enjoy
the
conversation
and
countenance
of
my
friends
,
among
which
number
he
declared
himself
one
of
the
most
faithful
;
assuring
me
,
that
I
should
be
always
welcome
to
his
table
,
and
want
for
nothing
;
and
promising
to
recommend
me
as
a
lodger
to
a
friend
of
his
,
with
whom
I
would
live
in
a
frugal
and
decent
manner
;
and
that
,
as
the
woman
was
well
known
and
esteemed
by
all
the
English
company
in
Paris
,
it
would
be
the
most
reputable
step
I
could
take
,
(
<EOS>
considering
my
youth
and
situation
)
to
lodge
with
a
creditable
person
,
who
could
answer
for
my
conduct
.
<EOS>
Thus
persuaded
,
I
very
simply
followed
his
advice
;
I
say
simply
,
because
,
notwithstanding
his
representations
,
I
soon
found
my
money
melt
away
,
without
any
prospect
of
a
fresh
supply
.
    
<EOS>
In
lieu
of
this
,
however
,
I
passed
my
time
very
agreeably
in
several
English
,
and
some
French
families
,
where
,
in
a
little
time
,
I
became
quite
intimate
,
saw
a
great
deal
of
company
,
and
was
treated
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
regard
;
yet
,
in
the
midst
of
these
pleasures
,
many
a
melancholy
sigh
would
rise
at
the
remembrance
of
my
beloved
S
#
#
#
#
,
whom
for
several
years
I
could
not
recollect
without
emotion
;
but
time
,
company
,
amusements
,
and
change
of
place
,
in
a
great
measure
dissipated
these
ideas
,
and
enabled
me
to
bear
my
fate
with
patience
and
resignation
.
    
<EOS>
On
my
last
arrival
at
Paris
,
I
was
surrounded
by
a
croud
of
professed
admirers
,
who
sighed
and
flattered
in
the
usual
forms
;
but
,
besides
that
my
heart
was
not
yet
in
a
condition
to
contract
new
engagements
,
I
was
prepossessed
against
them
all
,
by
supposing
that
they
presumed
upon
the
knowledge
of
my
indiscretion
with
S
#
#
#
#
;
and
therefore
rejected
their
addresses
with
detestation
and
disdain
:
for
,
as
I
have
already
observed
,
I
was
not
to
be
won
,
but
by
the
appearance
of
esteem
and
the
most
respectful
carriage
;
and
though
,
by
a
false
step
,
I
had
,
in
my
own
opinion
,
forfeited
my
title
to
the
one
,
I
was
resolved
to
discourage
the
advances
of
any
man
who
seemed
deficient
in
the
other
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
manner
,
my
lovers
were
,
one
by
one
,
repulsed
,
almost
as
soon
as
they
presented
themselves
,
and
I
preserved
the
independance
of
my
heart
,
until
I
became
acquainted
with
a
certain
peer
,
whom
I
often
saw
at
the
house
of
Mrs
P
#
#
#
#
,
an
English
lady
then
resident
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
This
young
nobleman
professed
himself
deeply
enamoured
of
me
,
in
a
stile
so
different
from
that
of
my
other
admirers
,
that
I
heard
his
protestations
without
disgust
;
and
though
my
inclinations
were
still
free
,
could
not
find
in
my
heart
to
discountenance
his
addresses
,
which
were
preferred
with
the
most
engaging
modesty
,
disinterestedness
and
respect
.
    
<EOS>
By
these
never
-
failing
arts
,
he
gradually
conquered
my
indifference
,
and
gained
the
preference
in
my
esteem
from
lord
C####y
and
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
were
at
that
time
his
rivals
.
<EOS>
But
what
contributed
(
more
than
any
consideration
)
to
his
success
,
was
his
declaring
openly
,
that
he
would
marry
me
without
hesitation
,
as
soon
as
I
could
obtain
a
divorce
from
my
present
husband
,
which
,
in
all
probability
,
might
have
been
easily
procured
;
for
before
I
left
England
,
lord
   
had
offered
me
five
thousand
pounds
,
if
I
would
consent
to
such
a
mutual
release
,
that
he
might
be
at
liberty
to
espouse
one
Miss
W
#
#
#
#
of
Kent
,
to
whom
he
then
made
love
upon
honourable
terms
:
but
I
was
fool
enough
to
refuse
his
proposal
,
by
the
advice
of
S
#
#
#
#
:
and
whether
or
not
his
lordship
finding
it
impracticable
to
we
d
<EOS>
his
new
mistress
,
began
to
make
love
upon
another
footing
,
I
know
not
;
but
certain
it
is
,
the
mother
forbad
him
the
house
,
a
circumstance
which
he
took
so
heinously
ill
,
that
he
appealed
to
the
world
in
a
public
advertisement
,
beginning
with
,
<EOS>
Whereas
,
for
some
time
,
I
have
passionately
loved
Miss
W
#
#
#
#
,
and
upon
my
not
complying
with
the
mother
's
proposals
,
they
have
turned
me
out
of
doors
;
this
is
to
justify
,
&
c.
    
<EOS>
This
declaration
,
signed
with
his
name
,
was
actually
printed
in
a
number
of
detached
advertisements
,
which
he
ordered
to
be
distributed
to
the
public
;
and
afterwards
,
being
convinced
by
some
of
his
friends
,
that
he
had
done
a
very
silly
thing
,
he
recalled
them
at
half
a
guinea
apiece
.
<EOS>
A
copy
of
one
of
them
was
sent
to
me
at
Paris
;
and
I
believe
my
father
has
now
one
of
the
originals
in
his
possession
.
    
<EOS>
After
this
wise
vindication
of
his
conduct
,
he
made
an
attempt
to
carry
off
the
lady
from
church
,
by
force
of
arms
;
but
she
was
rescued
by
the
neighbours
,
headed
by
her
brother
,
who
being
an
attorney
,
had
like
to
have
made
his
lordship
smart
severely
for
this
exploit
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
my
new
admirer
had
made
some
progress
in
my
heart
;
and
my
finances
being
exhausted
,
I
was
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
returning
to
lord
   
again
,
or
accepting
earl
B
#
#
#
#
's
love
.
<EOS>
When
my
affairs
were
brought
to
that
issue
,
I
made
no
hesitation
in
my
choice
,
putting
myself
under
the
protection
of
a
man
of
honour
,
whom
I
esteemed
,
rather
than
suffer
every
sort
of
mortification
,
from
a
person
who
was
the
object
of
my
abhorrence
and
contempt
.
<EOS>
From
a
mistaken
pride
,
I
chose
to
live
in
lord
B####k
's
house
,
rather
than
be
maintained
at
his
expence
in
any
other
place
.
<EOS>
We
spent
several
months
agreeably
in
balls
and
other
diversions
,
visited
lord
B####k
,
who
lived
at
the
distance
of
a
few
leagues
from
Paris
,
and
stayed
some
days
at
his
house
,
where
the
entertainment
was
,
in
all
respects
,
delightful
,
elegant
,
and
refined
.
<EOS>
Their
habitation
was
the
rendezvous
of
the
best
company
in
France
;
and
lady
<EOS>
B####k
maintained
the
same
superiority
in
her
own
sex
,
for
which
her
lord
is
so
justly
distinguished
among
the
men
.
    
<EOS>
About
Christmas
we
set
out
for
England
,
accompanied
by
a
little
North
Briton
,
who
lived
with
lord
B
#
#
#
#
as
his
companion
,
and
did
not
at
all
approve
of
our
correspondence
;
whether
out
of
real
friendship
for
his
patron
,
or
apprehension
that
in
time
I
might
supersede
his
own
influence
with
my
lord
,
I
shall
not
pretend
to
determine
.
    
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
will
,
the
frost
was
so
severe
,
that
we
were
detained
ten
days
at
Calais
,
before
we
could
get
out
of
the
harbour
;
and
during
that
time
,
I
reflected
seriously
on
what
my
new
lover
had
proposed
:
as
he
was
very
young
,
and
unacquainted
with
the
world
<EOS>
,
I
thought
my
story
might
have
escaped
him
;
and
therefore
determined
to
give
him
a
faithful
detail
of
the
whole
,
that
he
might
not
have
any
thing
to
reproach
me
with
in
the
sequel
;
besides
,
I
did
not
think
it
honest
to
engage
him
to
do
more
for
me
than
he
might
afterwards
,
perhaps
,
think
I
was
worth
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
communicated
to
him
every
particular
of
my
life
;
and
the
narration
,
far
from
altering
his
sentiments
,
rather
confirmed
his
good
opinion
,
by
exhibiting
an
undoubted
proof
of
my
frankness
and
sincerity
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
behaved
with
such
generosity
,
as
made
an
absolute
conquest
of
my
heart
:
but
my
love
was
of
a
different
kind
from
that
which
had
formerly
reigned
within
my
breast
,
being
founded
upon
the
warmest
gratitude
and
esteem
,
exclusive
of
any
other
consideration
,
though
his
person
was
very
agreeable
,
and
his
address
engaging
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
arrived
in
England
,
I
went
directly
to
his
country
-
seat
,
about
twelve
miles
from
London
,
where
he
soon
joined
me
,
and
we
lived
some
time
in
perfect
retirement
,
his
relations
being
greatly
alarmed
with
the
apprehension
that
lord
   
would
bring
an
action
against
him
;
though
he
himself
desired
nothing
more
,
and
lived
so
easily
under
that
expectation
,
that
they
soon
laid
aside
their
fears
on
his
account
.

We

,
a
relation
of
my
lord
,
and
one
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
of
the
guards
,
who
,
with
the
little
Scotch
gentleman
and
my
lover
,
made
an
agreeable
set
,
among
whom
I
enjoyed
hunting
,
and
all
manner
of
country
diversions
.
    
<EOS>
As
to
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
B
#
#
#
#
,
if
ever
there
was
perfection
in
one
man
<EOS>
,
it
centered
in
him
;
or
at
least
,
<EOS>
he
,
of
all
the
men
I
ever
knew
,
approached
nearest
to
that
idea
which
I
had
conceived
of
a
perfect
character
.
<EOS>
He
was
both
good
and
great
,
possessed
an
uncommon
genius
and
the
best
of
hearts
.
<EOS>
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
was
a
very
sociable
man
,
had
a
good
person
and
cultivated
understanding
;
and
my
lord
was
excessively
good
humoured
;
so
that
,
with
such
companions
,
no
place
could
be
dull
or
insipid
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
conducted
the
family
;
and
as
I
endeavoured
to
please
and
make
every
body
happy
,
I
had
the
good
fortune
to
succeed
.
<EOS>
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
told
me
,
that
before
he
saw
me
,
he
heard
I
was
a
fool
;
but
finding
(
as
he
was
pleased
to
say
)
that
I
had
been
egregiously
misrepresented
,
he
courted
my
friendship
,
and
a
correspondence
commenced
between
us
:
indeed
,
it
was
impossible
for
any
person
to
know
him
,
without
entertaining
the
utmost
esteem
and
veneration
for
his
virtue
.
    
<EOS>
After
I
had
lived
some
time
in
this
agreeable
retreat
,
my
husband
began
to
make
a
bustle
:
he
sent
a
message
,
demanding
me
from
lord
B
#
#
#
#
;
then
came
in
person
,
with
his
night
-
cap
in
his
pocket
,
intending
to
have
stayed
all
night
,
had
he
been
asked
,
and
attended
by
a
relation
,
whom
he
assured
that
I
was
very
fond
of
him
,
and
detained
by
force
from
his
arms
.
    
<EOS>
Finding
himself
disappointed
in
his
expectations
,
he
commenced
a
law
-
suit
against
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
though
not
for
a
divorce
,
as
we
desired
,
but
with
a
view
to
reclaim
me
as
his
lawful
wife
.
    
<EOS>
His
lawyers
,
however
,
attempted
to
prove
criminal
conversation
,
in
hopes
of
extorting
money
from
my
lover
;
but
their
endeavours
were
altogether
fruitless
;
for
no
servant
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
or
mine
,
could
with
justice
say
,
we
were
ever
seen
to
trespass
against
modesty
and
decorum
;
so
that
the
plaintiff
was
nonsuited
.
    
<EOS>
While
this
cause
was
depending
,
all
my
lover
's
friends
expressed
fear
and
concern
for
the
issue
,
while
he
himself
behaved
with
the
utmost
resolution
,
and
gave
me
such
convincing
proofs
of
a
strong
and
steady
affection
,
as
augmented
my
gratitude
,
and
rivetted
the
ties
of
my
love
,
which
was
unblemished
,
faithful
and
sincere
.
    
<EOS>
Soon
after
this
event
,
I
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
illness
,
in
which
I
was
visited
by
my
father
,
and
attended
by
two
physicians
,
one
of
whom
despaired
of
my
life
,
and
took
his
leave
accordingly
;
but
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
the
other
,
persisted
in
his
attendance
,
and
,
in
all
human
appearance
,
saved
my
life
;
a
circumstance
by
which
he
acquired
a
great
share
of
reputation
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
all
his
assistance
,
I
was
confined
to
my
bed
for
ten
weeks
;
during
which
,
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
grief
was
immoderate
,
his
care
and
generosity
unlimited
.
<EOS>
Whilst
I
lay
in
this
extremity
,
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
penetrated
by
my
melancholy
condition
,
which
revived
his
tenderness
,
begg'd
leave
to
be
admitted
to
my
presence
;
and
lord
B
#
#
#
#
would
have
complied
with
his
request
,
had
I
not
been
judged
too
weak
to
bear
the
shock
of
such
an
interview
.
    
<EOS>
My
constitution
,
however
,
agreeably
disappointed
their
fears
;
and
the
fever
had
no
sooner
left
me
,
than
I
was
removed
to
a
hunting
-
seat
belonging
to
my
lover
,
from
whence
,
<EOS>
after
I
had
recovered
my
strength
,
we
went
to
B
#
#
#
#
Castle
,
where
we
kept
open
house
:
and
while
we
remained
at
this
place
,
lord
B
#
#
#
#
received
a
letter
from
lord
  
,
dated
in
November
,
challenging
him
to
single
combat
in
May
,
upon
the
frontiers
of
France
and
Flanders
.
<EOS>
This
defiance
was
sent
in
consequence
of
what
had
passed
betwixt
them
long
before
my
indisposition
,
at
a
meeting
in
a
certain
tavern
,
where
they
quarrelled
,
and
in
the
fray
my
lover
threw
his
antagonist
under
the
table
.
<EOS>
I
counselled
him
to
take
no
notice
of
this
rhodomontade
,
which
I
knew
was
void
of
all
intention
of
performance
;
and
he
was
wise
enough
to
follow
my
advice
;
resolved
,
however
,
should
the
message
be
repeated
,
to
take
the
challenger
at
his
word
.
    
<EOS>
Having
resided
some
time
in
this
place
,
we
returned
to
the
other
country
-
house
which
we
had
left
,
where
lord
B
#
#
#
#
addicted
himself
so
much
to
hunting
,
and
other
male
diversions
,
that
I
began
to
think
he
neglected
me
,
and
apprized
him
of
my
suspicion
;
assuring
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
I
would
leave
him
as
soon
as
my
opinion
should
be
confirmed
.
    
<EOS>
This
declaration
had
no
effect
upon
his
behaviour
,
which
became
so
remarkably
cold
,
that
even
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
,
who
lived
with
us
,
imagined
that
his
affection
was
palpably
diminished
.
<EOS>
When
I
went
to
town
,
I
was
usually
attended
by
his
cousin
,
or
this
gentleman
,
or
both
,
but
seldom
favoured
with
his
company
;
nay
,
when
I
repaired
to
Bath
,
for
the
re
-
establishment
of
my
health
,
he
permitted
me
to
go
alone
;
so
that
I
was
quite
persuaded
of
his
indifference
;
and
<EOS>
yet
,
I
was
mistaken
in
my
opinion
:
<EOS>
but
,
I
had
been
spoiled
by
the
behaviour
of
my
first
husband
,
and
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
never
quitted
me
for
the
sake
of
any
amusement
,
and
often
resisted
the
calls
of
the
most
urgent
business
,
rather
than
part
from
me
,
tho
'
<EOS>
but
for
a
few
hours
.
    
<EOS>
I
thought
every
man
who
loved
me
truly
,
would
act
in
the
same
manner
;
and
whether
I
am
right
or
wrong
in
my
conjectures
,
I
leave
wiser
casuists
to
judge
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
such
sacrifice
and
devotion
is
the
most
pleasing
proof
of
an
admirer
's
passion
;
and
Voyez
moi
plus
souvent
,
&
ne
me
<EOS>
donnez
rien
,
is
one
of
my
favourite
maxims
.
<EOS>
A
man
may
give
money
,
because
he
is
profuse
;
he
may
be
violently
fond
,
because
he
is
of
a
sanguine
constitution
;
but
if
he
gives
me
his
time
,
he
gives
me
an
unquestionable
proof
of
my
being
in
full
possession
of
his
heart
.
    
<EOS>
My
appearance
at
Bath
,
without
the
company
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
occasioned
a
general
surprize
,
and
encouraged
the
men
to
pester
me
with
addresses
;
every
new
admirer
endeavouring
to
advance
his
suit
,
by
demonstrating
the
unkind
and
disrespectful
behaviour
of
his
lordship
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
this
was
the
most
effectual
string
they
could
touch
:
my
pride
and
resentment
were
alarmed
,
and
I
was
weak
enough
to
listen
to
one
man
,
who
had
like
to
have
insinuated
himself
into
my
inclinations
.
<EOS>
He
was
tall
and
large
boned
,
with
white
hair
,
inclining
to
what
is
called
sandy
,
and
had
the
reputation
of
being
handsome
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
think
he
scarce
deserved
that
epithet
.
<EOS>
He
possessed
a
large
fortune
,
loved
mischief
,
and
stuck
at
nothing
for
the
accomplishment
of
his
designs
;
one
of
his
chief
pleasures
,
being
that
of
setting
any
two
lovers
at
variance
.
<EOS>
He
employed
his
address
upon
me
with
great
assiduity
,
and
knew
so
well
how
to
manage
my
resentment
,
that
I
was
pleased
with
his
manner
,
heard
his
vows
without
disgust
,
and
,
in
a
word
,
promised
to
deliberate
with
myself
upon
his
proposals
,
and
give
him
an
account
of
my
determination
in
writing
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
resolved
,
I
went
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
in
Wiltshire
,
whither
<EOS>
I
was
followed
by
this
pretender
to
my
heart
,
who
visited
us
on
the
footing
of
an
acquaintance
;
but
when
I
reflected
on
what
I
had
done
,
I
condemned
my
own
conduct
,
as
indiscreet
,
though
nothing
decisive
had
passed
between
us
,
and
began
to
hate
him
in
proportion
to
the
self
-
conviction
I
felt
;
perceiving
that
I
had
involved
myself
in
a
difficulty
from
which
I
should
not
be
easily
disengaged
.
<EOS>
For
the
present
,
however
,
I
found
means
to
postpone
my
declaration
;
he
admitted
my
excuse
,
and
I
returned
to
London
with
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
again
summoned
to
the
field
by
his
former
challenger
.
    
<EOS>
H####d####n
,
governor
,
counsellor
,
and
steward
to
this
little
hero
,
came
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
with
a
verbal
message
,
importing
,
that
his
lordship
had
changed
his
mind
about
going
to
Flanders
,
but
expected
to
meet
him
,
on
such
a
day
and
hour
,
in
the
burying
-
ground
near
Red
-
lion
-
square
.
<EOS>
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
accepted
the
challenge
,
and
gave
me
an
account
of
what
had
passed
;
but
he
had
been
anticipated
by
the
messenger
,
who
had
already
tried
to
alarm
my
fears
,
from
the
consideration
of
the
consequence
,
that
I
might
take
some
measures
to
prevent
their
meeting
.
<EOS>
But
I
perceived
his
drift
,
and
told
him
plainly
that
lord
   
had
no
intention
to
risque
his
person
,
tho
'
he
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
persuade
me
,
that
his
principal
was
desperate
and
determined
.
<EOS>
I
knew
my
little
husband
too
well
,
to
think
he
would
bring
matters
to
any
dangerous
issue
,
and
was
apprehensive
of
nothing
but
foul
play
,
from
the
villainy
of
H####n
,
with
which
I
was
equally
well
acquainted
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
I
signified
my
doubts
on
that
score
to
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
would
have
attended
his
kinsman
to
the
field
,
had
he
not
thought
he
might
be
liable
to
censure
,
if
any
thing
should
happen
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
because
he
himself
was
heir
at
law
:
for
that
reason
,
he
judiciously
declined
being
personally
concerned
;
and
we
pitched
upon
the
earl
of
A
#
#
#
#
,
his
lordship
's
uncle
,
who
willingly
undertook
the
office
.
    
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
they
went
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
,
where
they
had
not
waited
long
when
the
challenger
appeared
,
in
a
new
pink
satin
waistcoat
,
which
he
had
put
on
for
the
occasion
,
with
his
sword
under
his
arm
,
and
his
steward
by
him
,
leaving
,
in
an
hackney
coach
,
at
some
distance
,
a
surgeon
whom
he
had
provided
for
the
care
of
his
person
.
<EOS>
Thus
equipped
,
he
advanced
to
his
antagonist
,
and
desired
him
to
choose
his
ground
;
upon
which
lord
B
#
#
#
#
told
him
,
that
if
he
must
fall
,
it
was
not
material
which
grave
he
should
tumble
over
.
    
<EOS>
Our
little
hero
finding
him
<EOS>
so
jocose
and
determined
,
turned
to
lord
A
#
#
#
#
,
and
desired
to
speak
with
him
,
that
he
might
disburden
his
conscience
before
they
should
begin
the
work
of
death
.
<EOS>
They
accordingly
went
aside
;
and
he
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
his
motive
for
fighting
was
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
detaining
his
wife
from
him
,
by
compulsion
.
<EOS>
The
earl
of
A
#
#
#
#
assured
him
,
he
was
egregiously
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
;
that
his
nephew
used
no
force
or
undue
influence
,
to
keep
me
in
his
house
;
but
it
could
not
be
expected
that
he
would
turn
me
out
of
doors
.
    
<EOS>
This
explanation
was
altogether
satisfactory
to
lord
  
,
who
said
he
was
far
from
being
so
unreasonable
as
to
expect
lord
B
#
#
#
#
would
commit
such
a
breach
of
hospitality
;
and
all
he
desired
was
,
that
his
wife
should
be
left
to
her
own
inclinations
.
<EOS>
Upon
these
articles
peace
was
concluded
,
and
they
parted
without
bloodshed
.
<EOS>
At
least
these
are
the
particulars
of
the
story
,
as
they
were
related
by
lord
A
#
#
#
#
,
with
whom
I
laugh'd
<EOS>
heartily
at
the
adventure
;
for
I
never
doubted
that
the
challenger
would
find
some
expedient
to
prevent
the
duel
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
wondered
how
he
mustered
up
resolution
enough
to
carry
it
so
far
.
    
<EOS>
That
he
might
not
,
however
,
give
us
any
more
trouble
,
we
resolved
to
go
and
enjoy
ourselves
in
France
,
whither
<EOS>
I
went
by
myself
,
in
hopes
of
being
soon
joined
by
my
lover
,
who
was
obliged
to
stay
some
time
longer
in
England
,
to
settle
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
much
affected
at
our
parting
<EOS>
(
tho
'
<EOS>
but
for
a
few
weeks
)
that
he
was
almost
distracted
;
and
this
affliction
renewed
my
tenderness
for
him
,
because
it
was
an
undoubted
proof
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
I
wrote
to
him
every
post
from
France
;
and
,
as
I
had
no
secrets
,
desired
him
to
take
care
of
all
the
letters
that
should
come
to
his
house
,
directed
to
me
,
after
my
departure
from
England
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
an
unfortunate
office
for
him
,
in
the
execution
of
which
he
chanced
to
open
a
letter
from
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
A
#
#
#
#
,
with
whom
(
as
I
have
already
observed
)
<EOS>
I
had
some
correspondence
at
Bath
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
,
according
to
my
promise
,
given
this
gentleman
a
decisive
answer
,
importing
,
that
I
was
determined
to
remain
in
my
present
situation
;
but
as
lord
B
#
#
#
#
was
ignorant
of
my
sentiments
in
that
particular
,
and
perceived
from
the
letter
that
something
extraordinary
had
passed
between
us
,
and
that
I
was
earnestly
sollicited
to
leave
him
,
he
was
seized
with
the
utmost
consternation
and
concern
;
and
having
previously
obtained
the
king
's
leave
to
go
abroad
,
set
out
that
very
night
for
France
,
leaving
his
affairs
in
the
greatest
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
T
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
A
#
#
#
#
hearing
<EOS>
I
was
gone
,
without
understanding
the
cause
of
my
departure
,
took
the
same
rout
,
and
both
arrived
at
Dover
next
day
.
<EOS>
They
heard
of
each
other
's
motions
:
<EOS>
each
bribed
the
master
of
a
packet
-
boat
to
transport
him
with
expedition
;
but
that
depending
upon
the
wind
,
both
reached
Calais
at
the
same
time
,
tho
'
in
different
vessels
.
<EOS>
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
sent
his
valet
de
chambre
,
post
,
with
a
letter
,
intreating
me
to
accompany
him
into
Italy
,
where
he
would
make
me
mistress
of
his
whole
fortune
,
and
to
set
out
directly
for
that
country
,
that
he
might
not
lose
me
by
the
arrival
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
promising
to
join
me
on
the
road
,
if
I
would
consent
to
make
him
happy
.
<EOS>
I
sent
his
messenger
back
with
an
answer
,
wherein
I
expressed
surprize
at
his
proposals
,
after
having
signified
my
resolution
to
him
before
I
left
England
;
and
he
was
scarce
dismissed
,
when
I
received
another
letter
from
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
beseeching
me
to
meet
him
at
Clermont
,
upon
the
road
from
Calais
;
and
conjuring
me
to
avoid
the
sight
of
his
rival
<EOS>
,
should
he
get
the
start
of
him
in
travelling
.
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
not
likely
to
be
the
case
,
as
lord
B
#
#
#
#
rode
post
,
and
the
other
was
,
by
his
corpulence
,
obliged
to
travel
in
a
chaise
;
yet
,
that
I
might
not
increase
his
anxiety
,
I
left
Paris
immediately
on
the
receit
of
his
message
,
and
met
him
at
the
appointed
place
,
where
he
received
me
with
all
the
agitation
of
joy
and
fear
,
and
asked
if
I
had
ever
encouraged
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
A
#
#
#
#
in
his
addresses
.
    
<EOS>
I
very
candidly
told
him
the
whole
transaction
,
at
which
he
was
incensed
;
but
his
indignation
was
soon
appeased
,
when
I
professed
my
penitence
,
and
assured
him
,
that
I
had
totally
rejected
his
rival
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
approve
of
my
behaviour
to
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
who
(
I
own
)
was
ill
used
in
this
affair
;
but
surely
it
was
more
excusable
to
halt
here
,
than
proceed
farther
in
my
indiscretion
.
    
<EOS>
My
lover
being
satisfied
with
my
declaration
,
we
went
together
to
Paris
,
being
attended
by
the
Scotchman
whom
I
have
already
mentioned
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
believe
he
was
not
over
and
above
well
pleased
to
see
matters
thus
amicably
compromised
.
<EOS>
The
furious
knight
followed
us
to
the
capital
;
insisted
upon
seeing
me
in
person
;
told
this
North
Briton
,
that
I
was
actually
engaged
to
him
;
wrote
every
hour
,
and
railed
at
my
perfidious
conduct
.
<EOS>
I
took
no
notice
of
these
delirious
transports
,
which
were
also
disregarded
by
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
till
one
night
he
was
exasperated
by
the
insinuations
of
Mr
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
I
believe
,
inflamed
his
jealousy
,
by
hinting
a
suspicion
that
I
was
really
in
love
with
his
rival
.
<EOS>
What
passed
betwixt
them
<EOS>
I
know
not
,
but
he
sent
for
me
from
the
opera
,
by
a
physician
of
Paris
,
who
was
a
sort
of
go
-
between
among
us
all
,
and
who
told
me
,
that
if
I
did
not
come
home
on
the
instant
,
a
duel
would
be
fought
on
my
account
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
shocked
at
this
information
;
but
by
being
used
to
alarms
from
the
behaviour
of
lord
  
,
I
had
acquired
a
pretty
good
share
of
resolution
,
and
with
great
composure
entered
the
room
where
lord
B
#
#
#
#
was
,
with
his
companion
,
whom
I
immediately
ordered
to
withdraw
.
    
<EOS>
I
then
gave
his
lordship
to
understand
,
that
I
was
informed
of
what
had
passed
,
and
thought
myself
so
much
injured
by
the
person
who
had
just
quitted
the
apartment
,
that
I
would
no
longer
live
under
the
same
roof
with
him
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
raved
like
a
bedlamite
,
taxing
me
with
want
of
candour
and
affection
;
but
I
easily
justified
my
own
integrity
,
and
gave
him
such
assurances
of
my
love
,
that
his
jealousy
subsided
,
and
his
spirits
were
recomposed
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
I
insisted
upon
his
dismissing
Mr
C
#
#
#
#
,
on
pain
of
my
leaving
the
house
,
as
I
could
not
help
thinking
he
had
used
his
endeavours
to
prejudice
me
in
the
opinion
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
If
his
conduct
was
the
result
of
friendship
for
his
patron
,
he
certainly
acted
the
part
of
an
honest
and
trusty
adherent
.
<EOS>
But
I
could
not
easily
forgive
him
,
because
,
a
few
weeks
before
,
he
had
,
by
my
interest
,
obtained
a
considerable
addition
to
his
allowance
;
and
even
after
the
steps
he
had
taken
to
disoblige
me
,
I
was
not
so
much
his
enemy
but
that
I
prevailed
upon
lord
B
#
#
#
#
to
double
his
salary
,
that
his
leaving
the
family
might
be
no
detriment
to
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
having
complied
with
my
demand
,
this
gentleman
,
after
having
stayed
three
days
in
the
house
,
to
prepare
for
his
departure
,
during
which
I
would
not
suffer
him
to
be
admitted
into
my
presence
,
made
his
retreat
with
a
fine
young
girl
who
was
my
companion
;
and
I
have
never
seen
him
since
that
time
.
    
<EOS>
Sir
T
#
#
#
#
still
continued
furious
,
and
would
not
take
a
denial
,
except
from
my
own
mouth
;
upon
which
,
with
the
approbation
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
I
indulged
him
with
an
interview
.
<EOS>
He
entered
the
apartment
with
a
stern
countenance
,
and
told
me
I
had
<EOS>
us'd
him
ill
.
<EOS>
I
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
,
and
begg'd
his
pardon
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
I
attempted
to
reason
the
case
with
him
,
but
he
would
hear
no
arguments
except
his
own
,
and
even
tried
to
intimidate
me
with
threats
;
which
provoked
me
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
defied
his
vengeance
,
telling
him
that
I
feared
nothing
but
the
reproach
of
my
own
conscience
;
that
tho
'
I
had
acted
a
simple
part
,
he
durst
not
say
there
was
any
thing
criminal
in
my
conduct
;
and
that
,
from
his
present
frantic
and
unjust
behaviour
,
I
thought
myself
happy
in
having
escaped
him
.
<EOS>
He
swore
I
was
the
most
inflexible
of
all
creatures
,
<EOS>
asked
if
nothing
would
move
me
?
<EOS>
and
when
I
answered
,
"
Nothing
,
"
took
his
leave
,
and
never
afterwards
persecuted
me
with
his
addresses
;
tho
'
<EOS>
I
have
heard
he
was
vain
and
false
enough
to
boast
of
favours
,
which
,
upon
my
honour
,
he
never
received
,
as
he
himself
,
at
one
time
,
owned
to
doctor
Cantwell
at
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
underwent
all
this
frenzy
and
distraction
upon
my
account
,
he
was
loved
with
the
same
violence
of
passion
by
a
certain
Scotch
lady
of
quality
,
who
,
when
he
followed
me
to
France
,
pursued
him
thither
with
the
same
eagerness
and
expedition
;
and
,
far
from
being
jealous
of
me
as
a
rival
,
us'd
to
come
to
my
house
,
implore
my
good
offices
with
the
object
of
her
love
,
and
laying
herself
on
the
floor
at
full
length
,
before
the
fire
,
weep
and
cry
like
a
person
bereft
of
her
senses
.
<EOS>
She
bitterly
complained
,
that
he
had
never
obliged
her
but
once
;
and
begg'd
,
with
the
most
earnest
supplications
,
that
I
would
give
her
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
at
my
house
.
<EOS>
But
I
thought
proper
to
avoid
her
company
,
as
soon
as
I
perceived
her
intention
.
    
<EOS>
We
continued
at
Paris
for
some
time
,
during
which
I
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
the
sister
of
madam
la
T
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
She
was
the
supposed
mistress
of
the
prince
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
endowed
with
a
great
share
of
understanding
,
and
loved
pleasure
to
excess
,
tho
'
she
maintained
her
reputation
on
a
respectable
footing
,
by
living
with
her
husband
and
mother
.
<EOS>
This
lady
,
perceiving
that
I
had
inspired
her
lover
with
a
passion
,
which
gave
me
uneasiness
on
her
account
,
actually
practised
all
her
eloquence
and
art
,
in
persuading
me
to
listen
to
his
love
;
for
it
was
a
maxim
with
her
,
to
please
him
at
any
rate
.
<EOS>
I
was
shocked
at
her
indelicate
complaisance
,
and
rejected
the
proposal
,
as
repugnant
to
my
present
engagement
,
which
I
held
as
sacred
as
any
nuptial
tie
,
and
much
more
binding
than
a
forced
or
unnatural
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
our
return
to
England
we
lived
in
great
harmony
and
peace
;
and
nothing
was
wanting
to
my
happiness
,
but
the
one
thing
to
me
most
needful
<EOS>
;
I
mean
the
inchanting
tenderness
and
delightful
enthusiasm
of
love
.
<EOS>
Lord
B
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
's
heart
(
I
believe
)
felt
the
soft
impressions
;
and
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
loved
him
with
the
most
faithful
affection
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
not
enough
to
say
I
wished
him
well
;
I
had
the
most
delicate
,
the
most
genuine
esteem
for
his
virtue
,
I
had
an
intimate
regard
and
anxiety
for
his
interest
,
and
felt
for
him
as
if
he
had
been
my
own
son
:
<EOS>
but
still
there
was
a
vacancy
in
my
heart
;
there
was
not
that
fervour
,
that
transport
,
that
ecstasy
of
passion
which
I
had
formerly
known
;
my
bosom
was
not
filled
with
the
little
deity
;
I
could
not
help
recalling
to
my
remembrance
the
fond
,
the
ravishing
moments
I
had
passed
with
S
#
#
#
#
;
and
had
I
understood
the
conditions
of
life
,
those
pleasures
were
happily
exchanged
for
my
present
situation
,
because
,
if
I
was
now
deprived
of
those
rapturous
enjoyments
,
I
was
also
exempted
from
the
cares
and
anxiety
that
attended
them
;
but
I
was
generally
extravagant
in
my
notions
of
happiness
,
and
therefore
construed
my
present
tranquillity
into
an
insipid
languor
and
stagnation
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
remained
in
this
inactivity
of
sentiment
,
lord
   
having
received
a
very
considerable
addition
to
his
fortune
,
sent
a
message
to
me
,
promising
,
that
if
I
would
leave
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
he
would
make
me
a
present
of
an
house
and
furniture
,
where
I
should
live
at
my
ease
,
without
being
exposed
to
his
visits
,
except
when
I
should
be
disposed
to
receive
them
.
<EOS>
This
proposal
he
made
,
in
consequence
of
what
I
had
always
declared
,
namely
,
that
if
he
had
not
reduced
me
to
the
necessity
of
putting
myself
under
the
protection
of
some
person
or
other
,
by
depriving
me
of
any
other
means
of
subsistence
,
I
should
never
have
given
the
world
the
least
cause
to
scandalize
my
reputation
;
and
that
I
would
withdraw
myself
from
my
present
dependance
,
as
soon
as
he
should
enable
me
to
live
by
myself
.
<EOS>
I
was
therefore
resolved
to
be
as
good
as
my
word
,
and
accepted
his
offer
,
on
condition
that
I
should
be
wholly
at
my
own
disposal
,
and
that
he
should
never
enter
my
door
but
as
a
visitant
or
common
friend
.
    
<EOS>
These
articles
being
sanctioned
by
his
word
and
honour
(
the
value
of
which
I
did
not
then
know
)
<EOS>
an
house
was
furnished
according
to
my
directions
;
and
I
signified
my
intention
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
consented
to
my
removal
,
with
this
proviso
,
that
I
should
continue
to
see
him
.
    
<EOS>
I
wrote
also
to
his
relation
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
in
his
answer
,
observed
,
that
it
was
too
late
to
advise
when
I
was
actually
determined
.
<EOS>
All
my
friends
and
acquaintance
approved
of
the
scheme
,
tho
'
it
was
one
of
the
most
unjustifiable
steps
I
had
ever
taken
,
being
a
real
act
of
ingratitude
to
my
benefactor
;
which
I
soon
did
,
and
always
shall
regret
and
condemn
.
<EOS>
So
little
is
the
world
qualified
to
judge
of
private
affairs
!
    
<EOS>
When
the
time
of
our
parting
drew
near
,
lord
B
#
#
#
#
became
gloomy
and
discontended
,
and
even
intreated
me
to
postpone
my
resolution
;
but
I
told
him
,
that
now
every
thing
was
prepared
for
my
reception
,
I
could
not
retract
without
incurring
the
imputation
of
folly
and
extravagance
.
<EOS>
On
the
very
day
of
my
departure
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
endeavoured
,
with
all
the
arguments
he
could
suggest
,
to
dissuade
me
from
my
purpose
;
and
I
made
use
of
the
same
answer
which
had
satisfied
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Finding
me
determined
upon
removing
,
he
burst
out
into
a
flood
of
tears
,
exclaiming
,
"
By
G####d
,
if
lord
B
#
#
#
#
can
bear
it
,
I
ca
n't
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
thunderstruck
at
this
expression
;
for
tho
'
I
had
been
told
that
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
was
in
love
with
me
,
I
gave
no
credit
to
the
report
,
because
he
had
never
declared
his
passion
,
and
this
was
the
first
hint
of
it
that
ever
escaped
him
in
my
heating
.
<EOS>
I
was
therefore
so
much
amazed
at
the
circumstance
of
this
abrupt
explanation
,
that
I
could
make
no
answer
;
but
having
taken
my
leave
,
went
away
,
ruminating
on
the
unforeseen
event
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
B
#
#
#
#
(
as
I
was
informed
)
spoke
not
a
word
that
whole
night
,
and
took
my
leaving
him
so
much
to
heart
,
that
two
years
elapsed
before
he
got
the
better
of
his
grief
.
    
<EOS>
This
intelligence
I
afterwards
received
from
his
own
mouth
,
and
asked
his
forgiveness
for
my
unkind
retreat
,
tho
<EOS>
'
I
shall
never
be
able
to
obtain
my
own
.
<EOS>
As
for
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
he
was
overwhelmed
with
sorrow
,
and
made
such
efforts
to
suppress
his
concern
,
as
had
well
nigh
cost
him
his

Dr
S
#
#
#
#
was
called
to
him
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
and
found
him
almost
suffocated
.
<EOS>
He
soon
guessed
the
cause
,
when
he
understood
that
I
had
left
the
house
:
so
that
I
myself
was
the
only
person
concerned
who
was
utterly
ignorant
of
his
affection
;
for
I
solemnly
declare
he
never
gave
me
the
least
reason
to
suspect
it
while
I
lived
with
his
relation
,
because
he
had
too
much
honour
to
entertain
a
thought
of
supplanting
his
friend
,
and
too
good
an
opinion
of
me
to
believe
he
should
have
succeeded
in
the
attempt
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
my
love
for
lord
B
#
#
#
#
was
not
so
tender
and
interesting
as
the
passion
I
had
felt
for
S
#
#
#
#
,
my
fidelity
was
inviolable
,
and
I
never
harboured
the
most
distant
thought
of
any
other
person
,
till
after
I
had
resolved
to
leave
him
,
when
(
I
own
)
<EOS>
I
afforded
some
small
encouragement
to
the
addresses
of
a
new
admirer
,
by
telling
him
,
that
I
should
,
in
a
little
time
,
be
my
own
mistress
<EOS>
,
tho
'
I
was
not
now
at
my
own
disposal
.
    
<EOS>
I
enjoyed
my
new
house
as
a
little
paradise
:
it
was
accommodated
with
all
sorts
of
conveniences
;
every
thing
was
new
,
and
therefore
pleasing
,
and
the
whole
absolutely
at
my
command
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
the
company
of
a
relation
,
a
very
good
woman
,
with
whom
I
lived
in
the
most
amicable
manner
;
was
visited
by
the
best
people
in
town
(
I
mean
those
of
the
male
sex
,
the
ladies
having
long
ago
forsaken
me
;
)
<EOS>
I
frequented
all
reputable
places
of
publick
entertainment
,
and
had
a
concert
at
home
once
a
week
:
so
that
my
days
rolled
on
in
happiness
and
quiet
,
till
all
my
sweets
were
imbittered
by
the
vexatious
behaviour
of
my
husband
,
who
began
to
importune
me
again
to
live
with
him
;
and
by
the
increasing
anxiety
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
(
tho
'
I
still
admitted
his
visits
)
plainly
perceived
that
I
wanted
to
relinquish
his
correspondence
.
<EOS>
This
discovery
raised
such
tempests
of
jealousy
and
despair
within
his
breast
,
that
he
kept
me
in
continual
alarms
:
he
sent
messages
to
me
every
hour
,
signed
his
letters
with
his
own
blood
,
raved
like
a
man
in
an
ecstasy
of
madness
,
railed
at
my
ingratitude
,
and
praised
my
conduct
,
by
turns
;
offered
to
sacrifice
every
thing
for
my
love
,
to
leave
the
kingdom
forthwith
,
and
live
with
me
for
ever
in
any
part
of
the
world
where
I
should
choose
to
reside
.
    
<EOS>
These
were
generous
and
tempting
proposals
;
but
I
was
beset
with
counsellors
who
were
not
totally
disinterested
,
and
who
dissuaded
me
from
embracing
the
proffers
of
my
lover
,
on
pretence
that
lord
   
would
be
highly
injured
by
my
compliance
.
<EOS>
I
listened
to
their
advice
,
and
hardened
my
heart
against
lord
B
#
#
#
#
's
sorrow
and
solicitations
.
<EOS>
My
behaviour
on
this
occasion
is
altogether
unaccountable
;
this
was
the
only
time
that
ever
I
was
a
slave
to
admonition
.
<EOS>
The
condition
of
lord
B
#
#
#
#
would
have
melted
any
heart
but
mine
,
and
yet
mine
was
one
of
the
most
sensible
:
he
employed
his
cousin
as
an
advocate
with
me
,
till
that
gentleman
actually
refused
the
office
,
telling
him
candidly
,
that
his
own
inclinations
were
too
much
engaged
,
to
permit
him
to
perform
the
task
with
fidelity
and
truth
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
resolved
to
avoid
my
presence
,
until
my
lord
and
I
should
come
to
some
final
determination
,
which
was
greatly
retarded
by
the
perseverance
of
his
lordship
,
who
would
not
resign
his
hopes
even
when
I
pretended
that
another
man
had
engaged
my
heart
,
but
said
,
that
in
time
my
affection
might
return
.
    
<EOS>
Our
correspondence
,
however
,
gradually
wore
off
;
upon
which
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
renewed
his
visits
,
and
many
agreeable
and
happy
hours
we
passed
together
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
,
or
any
other
person
whom
I
now
saw
,
succeeded
to
the
privilege
of
a
fortunate
lover
:
I
knew
he
loved
me
to
madness
;
but
I
would
not
gratify
his
passion
any
other
way
than
by
the
most
profound
esteem
and
veneration
for
his
virtues
,
which
were
altogether
amiable
and
sublime
;
and
I
would
here
draw
his
character
minutely
,
but
it
wou'd
take
up
too
much
time
to
set
forth
his
merits
;
the
only
man
living
of
my
acquaintance
who
resembles
him
is
lord
F
#
#
#
#
,
of
whom
I
shall
speak
in
the
sequel
.
    
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
I
underwent
a
very
interesting
change
in
the
situation
of
my
heart
.
<EOS>
I
had
sent
a
message
to
my
old
lover
S
#
#
#
#
,
desiring
he
would
allow
my
picture
,
which
was
in
his
possession
,
to
be
copied
;
and
he
now
transmitted
it
to
me
by
my
lawyer
,
whom
he
directed
to
ask
,
if
I
intended
to
be
at
the
next
masquerade
.
<EOS>
This
curiosity
had
a
strange
effect
upon
my
spirits
;
my
heart
fluttered
at
the
question
,
and
my
imagination
glowed
with
a
thousand
fond
presages
.
<EOS>
I
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
and
we
met
by
accident
at
the
ball
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
behold
him
without
emotion
;
when
he
accosted
me
,
his
well
-
known
voice
made
my
heart
vibrate
,
like
a
musical
chord
,
when
its
unison
is
struck
.
    
<EOS>
All
the
ideas
of
our
past
love
,
which
the
lapse
of
time
and
absence
had
enfeebled
and
lulled
asleep
,
now
awoke
,
and
were
reinspired
by
his
appearance
;
so
that
his
artful
excuses
were
easily
admitted
:
I
forgave
him
all
that
I
had
suffered
on
his
account
,
because
he
was
the
natural
lord
of
my
affection
;
and
our
former
correspondence
was
renewed
.
    
<EOS>
I
thought
myself
in
a
new
world
of
bliss
,
in
consequence
of
this
reconciliation
,
the
raptures
of
which
continued
unimpaired
for
the
space
of
four
months
,
during
which
time
he
was
fonder
of
me
,
if
possible
,
than
before
,
repeated
his
promise
of
marriage
,
if
we
should
ever
have
it
in
our
power
;
assured
me
he
had
never
been
happy
since
he
left
me
;
that
he
believed
no
woman
had
ever
loved
like
me
:
and
indeed
,
to
have
a
notion
of
my
passion
for
that
man
,
you
must
first
have
loved
as
I
did
:
but
,
through
a
strange
caprice
,
I
broke
off
the
correspondence
,
out
of
apprehension
that
he
would
forsake
me
again
.
<EOS>
From
his
past
conduct
,
I
dreaded
what
might
happen
;
and
the
remembrance
of
what
I
had
undergone
by
his
inconstancy
,
filled
my
imagination
with
such
horror
,
that
I
could
not
endure
the
shocking
prospect
,
and
prematurely
plunged
myself
into
the
danger
,
rather
than
endure
the
terrors
of
expectation
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
desertion
,
I
received
a
letter
from
him
,
acknowledging
that
he
was
rightly
served
,
but
that
it
gave
him
inexpressible
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
lord
   
continued
to
act
in
the
character
of
a
fiend
,
tormenting
me
with
his
nauseous
importunities
:
he
prevailed
upon
the
duke
of
L
#
#
#
#
to
employ
his
influence
in
persuading
me
to
live
with
him
;
assuring
his
grace
,
that
I
had
actually
promised
to
give
him
that
proof
of
my
obedience
,
and
that
I
would
come
home
the
sooner
for
being
pressed
to
compliance
by
a
person
of
his
rank
and
character
.
    
<EOS>
Induced
by
these
representations
,
the
duke
honoured
me
with
a
visit
;
and
in
the
course
of
his
exhortations
I
understood
how
he
had
been
thus
misinformed
:
upon
which
I
sent
for
lord
  
,
and
in
his
presence
convicted
him
of
the
falshood
,
by
communicating
to
his
grace
the
articles
of
our
last
agreement
,
which
he
did
not
think
proper
to
deny
;
and
the
duke
being
undeceived
,
declared
that
he
would
not
have
given
me
the
trouble
of
vindicating
myself
,
had
he
not
been
misled
by
the
insincerity
of
my
lord
.
    
<EOS>
Baffled
in
this
attempt
,
he
engaged
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
V
#
#
#
#
,
and
afterwards
my
own
father
,
in
the
same
task
;
and
tho
'
I
still
adhered
to
my
first
resolution
,
persisted
with
such
obstinacy
in
his
endeavours
to
make
me
unhappy
,
that
I
determined
to
leave
the
kingdom
;
and
accordingly
,
after
I
had
spent
the
evening
with
him
at
Ranelagh
,
I
went
away
about
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
leaving
my
companion
,
with
directions
to
restore
to
my
lord
his
house
,
furniture
,
plate
,
and
every
thing
he
had
given
me
since
our
last
accommodation
;
so
far
was
I
,
upon
this
occasion
,
or
at
any
other
time
of
my
life
,
from
embezzling
any
part
of
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
My
friend
followed
my
instructions
most
punctually
;
and
his
lordship
knows
,
and
will
acknowledge
,
the
truth
of
this
assertion
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
have
I
explained
the
true
cause
of
my
first
expedition
to
Flanders
,
whither
the
world
was
good
-
natured
enough
to
say
I
followed
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
and
the
whole
army
,
which
happened
to
be
sent
abroad
that
summer
.
<EOS>
Before
my
departure
I
likewise
transmitted
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
the
dressing
-
plate
,
china
,
and
a
very
considerable
settlement
,
of
which
he
had
been
generous
enough
to
make
me
a
present
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
an
instance
of
my
integrity
,
which
I
thought
due
to
a
man
who
had
laid
me
under
great
obligations
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
I
have
lived
to
be
refused
a
small
sum
both
by
him
and
S
#
#
#
#
,
I
do
not
repent
of
my
disinterested
behaviour
;
and
all
the
revenge
I
harbour
against
the
last
of
these
lovers
,
is
the
desire
of
having
it
in
my
power
to
do
him
good
.
    
<EOS>
I
now
found
myself
adrift
in
the
world
again
,
and
very
richly
deserved
the
hardships
of
my
condition
,
for
my
indiscretion
in
leaving
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
and
in
trusting
to
the
word
of
lord
  
,
without
some
farther
security
;
but
I
have
dearly
paid
for
my
imprudence
.
<EOS>
The
more
I
saw
into
the
character
of
this
man
whom
destiny
hath
appointed
my
scourge
,
the
more
was
I
determined
to
avoid
his
fellowship
and
communication
;
for
he
and
I
are
,
in
point
of
disposition
,
as
opposite
as
any
two
principles
in
nature
.
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
he
is
one
of
the
most
unsocial
beings
that
ever
existed
;
when
I
was
pleased
and
happy
he
was
always
out
of
temper
,
but
if
he
could
find
means
to
overcast
and
cloud
my
mirth
,
tho
'
never
so
innocent
,
he
then
discovered
the
signs
of
uncommon
satisfaction
and
content
,
because
,
by
this
disagreeable
temper
,
he
banished
all
company
from
his
house
.
<EOS>
He
is
extremely
weak
of
understanding
,
tho
'
he
possesses
a
good
share
of
low
cunning
,
which
has
so
egregiously
imposed
upon
some
people
,
that
they
have
actually
believed
him
a
good
-
natured
easy
creature
,
and
blamed
me
because
I
did
not
manage
him
to
better
purpose
;
but
,
upon
further
acquaintance
,
they
have
always
found
him
obstinate
as
a
mule
,
and
capricious
as
a
monkey
.
    
<EOS>
Not
that
he
is
utterly
void
of
all
commendable
qualities
:
he
is
punctual
in
paying
his
debts
,
liberal
when
in
good
humour
,
and
would
be
well
bred
,
were
he
not
subject
to
fits
of
absence
,
during
which
he
is
altogether
unconversable
;
but
he
is
proud
,
naturally
suspicious
,
jealous
,
equally
with
and
without
cause
,
never
made
a
friend
,
and
is
an
utter
stranger
to
the
joys
of
intimacy
;
in
short
,
he
hangs
like
a
damp
upon
society
,
and
may
be
properly
called
Kill
-
joy
,
an
epithet
which
he
has
justly
acquired
.
<EOS>
He
honours
me
with
constant
professions
of
love
,
but
his
conduct
is
so
opposite
to
my
sentiments
of
that
passion
,
as
to
have
been
the
prime
source
of
all
my
misfortunes
and
affliction
;
and
I
have
often
wished
myself
the
object
of
his
hate
,
in
hopes
of
profiting
by
a
change
in
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
has
not
been
able
to
make
me
more
unhappy
than
<EOS>
,
I
believe
,
he
is
in
his
own
mind
;
for
he
is
literally
a
self
-
tormentor
,
who
never
enjoyed
one
gleam
of
satisfaction
,
except
at
the
expence
of
another
's
quiet
;
and
yet
with
this
(
I
had
almost
called
it
diabolical
)
quality
,
he
expects
that
I
should
cherish
him
with
all
the
tenderness
of
affection
;
and
after
he
has
been
at
pains
to
incur
my
aversion
,
punishes
my
disgust
,
by
contriving
schemes
to
mortify
and
perplex
me
,
which
have
often
succeeded
so
effectually
,
as
to
endanger
my
life
and
constitution
;
for
I
have
been
fretted
and
frighted
into
sundry
fits
of
illness
,
and
then
I
own
<EOS>
I
have
experienced
his
care
and
concern
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
the
oddities
I
have
mentioned
,
he
is
so
unsteady
in
his
oeconomy
,
that
he
is
always
new
modelling
his
affairs
,
and
exhausting
his
fortune
,
by
laying
out
ten
pounds
,
in
order
to
save
a
shilling
;
he
inquires
into
the
character
of
a
servant
after
he
has
lived
two
years
in
his
family
,
and
is
so
ridiculously
stocked
with
vanity
and
self
-
conceit
,
that
notwithstanding
my
assurance
before
,
and
the
whole
series
of
my
conduct
since
our
marriage
,
which
ought
to
have
convinced
him
of
my
dislike
,
he
is
still
persuaded
,
that
at
bottom
,
I
must
admire
and
be
enamoured
of
his
agreeable
person
and
accomplishments
,
and
that
I
would
not
fail
to
manifest
my
love
,
were
I
not
spirited
up
against
him
by
his
own
relations
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
it
might
be
their
interest
to
foment
the
misunderstanding
betwixt
us
;
but
really
,
they
give
themselves
no
trouble
about
our
affairs
;
and
,
so
far
as
I
know
them
,
are
a
very
good
sort
of
people
.
<EOS>
On
the
whole
,
I
think
I
may
with
justice
pronounce
<EOS>
my
precious
yoke
-
fellow
a
trifling
,
teazing
,
insufferable
,
inconsistent
creature
.
    
<EOS>
With
the
little
money
which
remained
of
what
I
had
received
from
his
lordship
,
for
housekeeping
,
I
transported
myself
to
Flanders
,
and
arrived
in
Ghent
,
a
few
days
after
our
troops
were
quartered
in
that
city
,
which
was
so
much
crowded
with
these
new
visitants
,
that
I
should
have
found
it
impracticable
to
procure
a
lodging
,
had
I
not
been
accommodated
by
lord
R
#
#
#
#
B
#
#
#
#
,
the
duke
of
A
#
#
#
#
's
youngest
brother
,
who
very
politely
gave
me
up
his
own
.
<EOS>
Here
I
saw
my
friend
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
overjoyed
at
my
arrival
,
though
jealous
of
every
man
of
his
acquaintance
;
for
he
loved
me
with
all
the
ardour
of
passion
,
and
I
regarded
him
with
all
the
perfection
of
friendship
,
which
,
had
he
lived
,
<EOS>
in
time
might
have
produced
love
;
but
it
never
did
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
his
earnest
solicitations
to
the
contrary
,
I
stayed
but
<EOS>
a
week
in
Ghent
,
from
whence
I
proceeded
to
Brussels
,
and
fixed
my
abode
in
the
Hotel
de
Flandre
,
among
an
agreeable
set
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
with
whom
I
spent
my
time
very
chearfully
.
<EOS>
There
being
a
sort
of
court
in
this
city
,
it
was
frequented
by
all
the
officers
,
who
could
obtain
permission
to
go
thither
;
and
the
place
in
general
was
gay
and
agreeable
.
<EOS>
I
was
introduced
to
the
best
families
,
and
very
happy
in
my
acquaintance
;
for
the
ladies
were
polite
,
good
tempered
,
and
obliging
,
and
treated
me
with
the
utmost
hospitality
and
respect
.
<EOS>
Among
others
,
I
contracted
a
friendship
with
Madam
la
comtesse
de
C
#
#
#
#
,
and
her
two
daughters
,
who
were
very
amiable
young
ladies
;
and
became
intimate
with
the
princess
C
#
#
#
#
and
countess
W
#
#
#
#
,
lady
of
the
bed
-
chamber
to
the
queen
of
Hungary
,
and
a
great
favourite
of
the
governor
Monsieur
D'H
#
#
#
#
,
in
whose
house
she
lived
with
his
wife
,
who
was
also
a
lady
of
a
very
engaging
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
Soon
after
I
had
fixed
my
habitation
in
Brussels
,
the
company
at
our
Hotel
was
increased
by
three
officers
,
who
professed
themselves
my
admirers
,
and
came
from
Ghent
,
with
a
view
of
soliciting
my
love
.
<EOS>
This
triumvirate
consisted
of
the
Scotch
earl
of
 
,
lord
R
#
#
#
#
M
#
#
#
#
,
and
another
young
officer
:
the
first
was
a
man
of
a
very
genteel
figure
and
amorous
complexion
,
danced
well
,
and
had
a
great
deal
of
good
humour
,
with
a
mixture
of
vanity
and
self
-
conceit
.
<EOS>
The
second
had
a
good
face
,
though
a
clumsy
person
,
and
a
very
sweet
disposition
,
very
much
adapted
for
the
sentimental
passion
of
love
:
and
the
third
<EOS>
(
Mr
W
#
#
#
#
by
name
)
was
tall
,
thin
,
and
well
-
bred
,
with
a
great
stock
of
good
nature
and
vivacity
.
    
<EOS>
These
adventurers
began
their
addresses
in
general
acts
of
gallantry
,
that
comprehended
several
of
my
female
friends
,
with
whom
we
used
to
engage
in
parties
of
pleasure
,
both
in
the
city
and
the
environs
,
which
are
extremely
agreeable
;
and
when
they
thought
they
had
taken
the
preliminary
steps
of
securing
themselves
in
my
good
opinion
and
esteem
,
they
agreed
to
go
on
without
farther
delay
,
and
that
lord
   
should
make
the
first
attack
upon
my
heart
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
laid
siege
to
me
,
with
such
warmth
and
assiduity
,
<EOS>
that
I
believe
he
deceived
himself
,
and
began
to
think
he
was
actually
in
love
;
though
at
bottom
,
he
felt
no
impulse
that
deserved
the
sacred
name
.
<EOS>
Though
I
discouraged
him
in
the
beginning
,
he
persecuted
me
with
his
addresses
;
he
always
sat
by
me
at
dinner
,
and
imparted
a
thousand
trifles
in
continual
whispers
,
which
attracted
the
notice
of
the
company
so
much
,
that
I
began
to
fear
his
behaviour
would
give
rise
to
some
report
to
my
prejudice
;
and
therefore
avoided
him
with
the
utmost
caution
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
my
care
,
however
,
he
found
means
one
night
,
while
my
maid
,
who
lay
in
my
room
,
went
down
stairs
,
to
get
into
my
chamber
after
I
was
abed
:
upon
which
,
I
started
up
,
and
told
him
,
that
if
he
should
approach
me
,
I
would
alarm
the
house
;
for
I
never
wanted
courage
and
resolution
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
my
displeasure
,
he
kneeled
by
the
bed
-
side
,
<EOS>
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
have
pity
on
his
sufferings
,
and
swore
I
should
have
carte
blanche
to
the
utmost
extent
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
To
these
proposals
I
made
no
other
reply
,
but
that
of
protesting
I
would
never
speak
to
him
again
,
if
he
did
not
quit
my
apartment
that
moment
;
upon
which
,
he
thought
proper
to
withdraw
;
and
I
never
afterwards
gave
him
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
me
on
the
same
subject
:
so
that
,
in
a
few
weeks
,
he
separated
himself
from
our
society
;
though
the
ladies
of
Brussels
considered
him
as
my
lover
,
because
,
of
all
the
other
officers
,
he
was
their
greatest
favourite
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
being
thus
repulsed
,
Mr
W
#
#
#
#
took
the
field
,
and
assailed
my
heart
in
a
very
different
manner
.
<EOS>
He
said
,
he
knew
not
how
to
make
love
,
but
was
a
man
of
honour
,
would
keep
the
secret
,
and
so
forth
.
<EOS>
To
this
cavalier
address
I
answered
,
that
I
was
not
angry
,
as
I
otherwise
should
have
been
at
his
blunt
declaration
,
because
I
found
,
by
his
own
confession
,
he
did
not
know
what
was
due
to
the
sex
;
and
my
unhappy
situation
in
some
shape
excused
him
for
a
liberty
,
which
he
would
not
have
dream'd
of
taking
,
had
not
my
misfortunes
encouraged
his
presumption
.
<EOS>
But
I
would
deal
with
him
in
his
own
way
;
and
far
from
assuming
the
prude
,
frankly
assured
him
,
that
he
was
not
at
all
to
my
taste
,
hoping
he
would
consider
my
dislike
as
a
sufficient
reason
to
reject
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
R
#
#
#
#
began
to
feel
the
symptoms
of
a
genuine
passion
,
which
he
carefully
cherished
in
silence
,
being
naturally
diffident
and
bashful
;
but
,
by
the
very
means
he
used
to
conceal
it
from
my
observation
,
I
plainly
discerned
the
situation
of
his
heart
,
and
was
not
at
all
displeased
at
the
progress
I
had
made
in
his
inclinations
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
cultivated
my
acquaintance
with
great
assiduity
and
respect
,
attended
me
in
all
my
excursions
,
and
particularly
in
an
expedition
to
Antwerp
,
with
two
other
gentlemen
,
where
,
in
downright
gaiet
de
coeur
,
we
sat
for
our
pictures
,
which
were
drawn
in
one
piece
;
one
of
the
partie
being
represented
in
the
dress
of
an
hussar
,
and
another
in
that
of
a
running
footman
.
<EOS>
This
incident
I
mention
,
because
the
performance
,
which
is
now
in
my
possession
,
gave
birth
to
a
thousand
groundless
reports
,
that
circulated
in
England
at
our
expence
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
immediately
after
this
jaunt
,
that
lord
R
#
#
#
#
began
to
disclose
his
passion
;
though
he
,
at
the
same
time
,
started
such
objections
as
seemed
well
nigh
to
extinguish
his
hopes
,
lamenting
,
that
even
if
he
should
have
the
happiness
to
engage
my
affections
,
his
fortune
was
too
inconsiderable
to
support
us
against
the
efforts
of
lord
  
,
should
he
attempt
to
interrupt
our
felicity
;
and
that
he
himself
was
obliged
to
follow
the
motions
of
the
army
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
seemed
to
consider
my
felicity
more
than
his
own
,
and
behaved
with
such
delicacy
,
as
gradually
made
an
impression
on
my
heart
;
so
that
when
we
parted
,
we
agreed
to
renew
our
correspondence
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
agreeable
amusements
,
which
I
enjoyed
in
almost
all
the
different
towns
of
Flanders
,
I
happened
to
be
at
Ghent
one
day
,
sitting
among
a
good
deal
of
company
,
in
one
of
their
Hotels
,
when
a
post
-
chaise
stopped
at
the
gate
;
upon
which
we
went
to
the
windows
to
satisfy
our
curiosity
,
when
who
should
step
out
of
the
convenience
,
but
my
little
insignificant
lord
.
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
announced
him
to
the
company
,
than
all
the
gentlemen
asked
whether
they
should
stay
and
protect
me
,
or
withdraw
;
and
when
I
assured
them
,
that
their
protection
was
not
necessary
,
one
and
all
of
them
retired
;
though
lord
R
#
#
#
#
M
#
#
#
#
went
no
farther
than
the
parlour
below
,
being
determined
to
screen
me
against
all
violence
and
compulsion
.
    
<EOS>
I
sent
a
message
to
my
lord
,
desiring
him
to
walk
up
into
my
apartment
;
but
although
his
sole
errand
was
to
see
and
carry
me
off
,
he
would
not
venture
to
accept
of
my
invitation
,
till
he
had
demanded
me
in
form
,
from
the
governor
of
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
That
gentleman
being
altogether
a
stranger
to
his
person
and
character
,
referred
him
to
the
commanding
officer
of
the
English
troops
,
who
was
a
man
of
humour
,
and
upon
his
lordship
's
application
,
pretended
to
doubt
his
identity
;
observing
,
that
he
had
always
heard
lord
   
represented
as
a
jolly
corpulent
man
.
<EOS>
He
gave
him
to
understand
,
however
,
that
even
granting
him
to
be
the
person
<EOS>
,
I
was
by
no
means
subject
to
military
law
,
unless
he
could
prove
,
that
I
had
ever
inlisted
in
his
majesty
's
service
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
disappointed
in
his
endeavours
,
he
returned
to
the
inn
,
and
,
with
much
persuasion
,
trusted
himself
in
my
dining
-
room
,
after
having
stationed
his
attendant
at
the
door
,
in
case
of
accidents
.
<EOS>
When
I
asked
,
what
had
procured
me
the
honour
of
this
visit
;
he
told
me
,
his
business
and
intention
were
to
carry
me
home
;
and
this
declaration
produced
a
conference
,
in
which
I
argued
the
case
with
him
;
and
matters
were
accommodated
for
the
present
,
by
my
promising
to
be
in
England
some
time
in
September
,
on
condition
that
he
would
permit
me
to
live
by
myself
,
as
before
,
and
immediately
order
the
arrears
of
my
pin
-
money
to
be
paid
.
<EOS>
He
assented
to
every
thing
I
proposed
,
returned
in
peace
to
his
own
country
,
and
the
deficiencies
of
my
allowance
were
made
good
;
while
I
returned
to
Brussels
,
where
I
stayed
until
my
departure
for
England
,
which
I
regulated
in
such
a
manner
as
was
consistent
with
my
engagement
.
    
<EOS>
I
took
lodgings
in
Pall
-
mall
,
and
sending
for
my
lord
,
convinced
him
of
my
punctuality
,
and
put
him
in
mind
of
his
promise
;
when
,
to
my
utter
astonishment
and
confusion
,
he
owned
,
that
his
promise
was
no
more
than
a
decoy
to
bring
me
over
,
and
that
I
must
lay
my
account
with
living
in
his
house
,
like
a
dutiful
and
obedient
wife
.
<EOS>
I
heard
him
with
the
indignation
such
treatment
deserved
,
upbraided
him
with
his
perfidious
dealing
,
which
I
told
him
would
have
determined
me
against
cohabitation
with
him
,
had
I
not
been
already
resolved
:
and
being
destitute
of
all
resource
,
repaired
to
Bath
,
where
I
afterwards
met
with
Mr
D
#
#
#
#
and
Mr
R
#
#
#
#
,
two
gentlemen
who
had
been
my
fellow
-
passengers
in
the
yacht
from
Flanders
,
and
treated
me
with
great
friendship
and
politeness
,
without
either
talking
or
thinking
of
love
.
    
<EOS>
With
these
gentlemen
,
who
were
as
idle
as
myself
,
I
went
to
the
jubilee
at
Preston
,
which
was
no
other
than
a
great
number
of
people
assembled
in
a
small
town
extremely
ill
accommodated
,
to
partake
of
diversions
that
were
bad
imitations
of
plays
,
concerts
,
and
masquerades
.
<EOS>
If
the
world
should
place
to
the
account
of
my
indiscretion
,
my
travelling
in
this
manner
,
with
gentlemen
to
whom
I
had
no
particular
attachment
;
let
it
also
be
considered
,
as
an
alleviation
,
that
I
always
lived
in
terror
of
my
lord
,
and
consequently
was
often
obliged
to
shift
my
quarters
;
so
that
my
finances
being
extremely
slender
,
I
stood
the
more
in
need
of
assistance
and
protection
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
,
besides
,
young
,
inconsiderate
,
and
so
simple
,
as
to
suppose
the
figure
of
an
ugly
man
would
always
secure
me
from
censure
on
his
account
:
<EOS>
neither
did
I
ever
dream
of
any
man
's
addresses
,
until
he
made
an
actual
declaration
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
my
return
to
Bath
,
I
was
again
harrassed
by
lord
  
,
who
came
thither
accompanied
by
my
father
,
whom
I
was
very
glad
to
see
,
though
he
importuned
me
to
comply
with
my
husband
's
desire
,
and
for
the
future
keep
measures
with
the
world
.
<EOS>
This
remonstrance
about
living
with
my
lord
,
which
he
constantly
repeated
,
was
the
only
instance
of
his
unkindness
which
I
ever
felt
.
<EOS>
But
all
his
admonitions
were
not
of
force
sufficient
to
shake
my
resolution
in
that
particular
;
though
the
debate
continued
so
late
,
that
I
told
his
lordship
,
it
was
high
time
to
retire
,
for
I
could
not
accommodate
him
with
a
bed
.
<EOS>
He
then
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
he
would
stay
where
he
was
;
upon
which
my
father
took
his
leave
,
on
pretence
of
looking
out
for
a
lodging
to
himself
.
    
<EOS>
The
little
gentleman
being
now
left
tte
a
tte
with
me
,
began
to
discover
some
signs
of
apprehension
in
his
looks
;
but
mustering
up
all
his
resolution
,
he
went
to
the
door
,
called
up
three
of
his
servants
,
whom
he
placed
as
centinels
upon
the
stair
,
and
flung
himself
in
my
elbow
-
chair
,
where
he
resigned
himself
to
rest
.
<EOS>
Intending
to
go
to
bed
,
I
thought
it
was
<EOS>
but
just
and
decent
that
I
should
screen
myself
from
the
intrusion
of
his
footmen
,
and
with
that
view
bolted
the
door
.
<EOS>
Lord
   
hearing
himself
locked
in
,
started
up
in
the
utmost
terror
and
consternation
,
kicked
the
door
with
his
heel
,
and
screamed
aloud
,
as
if
he
had
been
in
the
hands
of
an
assassin
.
    
<EOS>
My
father
,
who
had
not
yet
quitted
the
house
,
hearing
these
outcries
,
ran
up
stairs
again
,
and
coming
through
my
bed
-
chamber
,
into
the
dining
-
room
where
we
were
,
found
me
almost
suffocated
with
laughter
,
and
his
heroic
son
-
in
-
law
staring
like
one
who
had
lost
his
wits
,
with
his
hair
standing
on
end
.
    
<EOS>
When
my
father
asked
the
meaning
of
his
exclamations
,
he
told
him
with
all
the
symptoms
of
dismay
,
that
I
had
lock'd
him
in
,
and
he
did
not
understand
such
usage
:
but
I
explained
the
whole
mystery
,
by
saying
,
I
had
bolted
the
door
,
because
I
did
not
like
the
company
of
his
servants
,
and
could
not
imagine
the
cause
of
his
pannic
,
unless
he
thought
I
designed
to
ravish
him
;
an
insult
,
than
which
nothing
was
farther
from
my
intention
.
<EOS>
My
father
himself
could
scarce
refrain
from
laughing
at
his
ridiculous
fear
;
but
seeing
him
in
great
confusion
,
took
pity
on
his
condition
,
and
carried
him
off
to
his
own
lodgings
,
after
I
had
given
my
word
,
that
I
would
not
attempt
to
escape
,
but
give
him
audience
next
morning
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
kept
my
promise
,
and
found
means
to
persuade
them
to
leave
me
at
my
own
discretion
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
I
was
rallied
upon
the
stratagem
I
had
contrived
to
frighten
lord
  
;
and
a
thousand
idle
stories
were
told
about
this
adventure
,
which
happened
literally
as
I
have
related
it
.
    
<EOS>
From
Bath
I
betook
myself
to
a
small
house
near
Lincoln
,
which
I
hired
of
the
d
#
#
#
#
of
A
#
#
#
#
,
because
a
country
life
suited
best
with
my
income
,
which
was
no
more
than
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
and
that
not
well
paid
.
    
<EOS>
I
continued
some
months
in
this
retirement
,
and
saw
no
company
,
except
lord
R
#
#
#
#
M
#
#
#
#
,
who
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
visited
me
twice
;
till
finding
myself
indisposed
,
I
was
obliged
to
remove
to
London
,
and
took
lodgings
in
Maddox
-
street
,
where
my
garison
was
taken
by
storm
,
by
my
lord
and
his
steward
,
reinforced
by
Mr
L
#
#
#
#
V
#
#
#
#
,
(
who
,
as
my
lord
told
me
,
had
a
subsidy
of
five
and
twenty
pounds
,
before
he
would
take
the
field
)
and
a
couple
of
hardy
footmen
.
<EOS>
This
formidable
band
rushed
into
my
apartment
,
laid
violent
hands
upon
me
,
dragged
me
down
stairs
,
without
gloves
or
a
cloak
,
and
thrusting
me
into
a
coach
that
stood
at
the
door
,
conveyed
me
to
my
lord
's
lodgings
in
Gloucester
-
street
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
this
occasion
,
his
lordship
courageously
drew
his
sword
upon
my
woman
,
who
attempted
to
defend
me
from
his
insults
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
intimidated
him
from
proceeding
;
for
he
looked
pale
and
aghast
,
his
knees
knocked
together
,
and
he
breathed
thick
and
hard
,
with
his
nostrils
dilated
,
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
encouraged
by
his
mercenary
associate
,
who
,
for
the
five
and
twenty
pounds
,
stood
by
him
in
the
day
of
trouble
,
and
spirited
him
on
to
this
gallant
enterprize
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
exploit
,
I
was
cooped
up
in
a
paultry
apartment
in
Gloucester
-
street
,
where
I
was
close
beset
by
his
lordship
,
and
his
worthy
steward
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
,
with
a
set
of
servants
that
were
the
creatures
of
this
fellow
,
of
whom
lord
   
himself
stood
in
awe
;
so
that
I
could
not
help
thinking
myself
in
Newgate
,
among
thieves
and
ruffians
:
and
to
such
a
degree
<EOS>
did
my
terror
prevail
,
that
I
actually
believed
I
was
in
danger
of
being
poisoned
,
and
would
not
receive
any
sustenance
,
except
from
the
hands
of
one
harmless
-
looking
fellow
,
a
foreigner
,
who
was
my
lord
's
valet
de
chambre
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
not
pretend
to
say
my
fears
were
just
;
but
such
was
my
opinion
of
H####n
,
that
I
never
doubted
he
would
put
me
out
of
the
way
,
if
he
thought
my
life
interfered
with
his
interest
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
second
day
of
my
imprisonment
,
I
was
visited
by
the
duke
of
L
#
#
#
#
,
a
friend
of
my
lord
,
who
found
me
sitting
upon
a
trunk
,
in
a
poor
little
dining
-
room
filled
with
lumber
,
and
lighted
with
two
bits
of
tallow
-
candle
,
which
had
been
left
over
night
.
<EOS>
He
perceived
in
my
countenance
a
mixture
of
rage
,
indignation
,
terror
and
despair
:
he
compassionated
my
sufferings
,
though
he
could
not
alleviate
my
distress
,
any
other
way
than
by
interceding
with
my
tyrant
to
mitigate
my
oppression
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
remained
eleven
days
in
this
comfortable
situation
:
I
was
watched
like
a
criminal
all
day
,
and
one
of
the
servants
walked
from
one
room
to
another
all
night
,
in
the
nature
of
a
patrole
;
while
my
lord
,
who
lay
in
the
chamber
above
me
,
got
out
of
bed
,
and
tripp'd
<EOS>
to
the
window
,
at
the
sound
of
every
coach
that
chanced
to
pass
through
the
street
.
<EOS>
H####n
,
who
was
consummate
in
the
arts
of
a
sycophant
,
began
to
court
my
favour
,
by
condoling
my
affliction
,
and
assuring
me
,
that
the
only
method
by
which
I
could
regain
my
liberty
,
was
a
chearful
compliance
with
the
humour
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
I
was
fully
convinced
of
the
truth
of
this
observation
;
and
though
my
temper
is
altogether
averse
to
dissimulation
,
attempted
to
affect
an
air
of
serenity
and
resignation
.
<EOS>
But
this
disguise
,
I
found
,
would
not
answer
my
purpose
;
and
therefore
I
had
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
my
maid
,
who
was
permitted
to
attend
me
in
my
confinement
.
    
<EOS>
With
her
I
frequently
consulted
about
the
means
of
accomplishing
my
escape
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
our
deliberations
,
she
directed
a
coach
and
six
to
be
ready
at
a
certain
part
of
the
town
,
and
to
wait
for
me
three
days
in
the
same
place
,
in
case
I
could
not
come
before
the
expiration
of
that
term
.
    
<EOS>
This
previous
measure
being
taken
according
to
my
instructions
,
the
next
necessary
step
was
to
elude
the
vigilance
of
my
guard
:
and
in
this
manner
did
I
effectuate
my
purpose
.
<EOS>
Being
,
by
this
time
,
indulged
in
the
liberty
of
going
out
in
the
coach
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
,
attended
by
two
footmen
,
who
had
orders
to
watch
all
my
motions
,
I
made
use
of
this
privilege
one
forenoon
,
when
lord
   
expected
some
company
to
dinner
,
and
bad
the
coachman
drive
to
the
lodgings
of
a
man
who
wrote
with
his
mouth
,
intending
to
give
my
spies
the
slip
,
on
pretence
of
seeing
this
curiosity
:
but
they
were
too
alert
in
their
duty
to
be
thus
outwitted
,
and
followed
me
up
stairs
into
the
very
apartment
.
    
<EOS>
Disappointed
in
this
hope
,
I
revolved
another
scheme
,
which
was
attended
with
success
:
I
bought
some
olives
at
an
oil
-
shop
;
and
telling
the
servants
I
would
proceed
to
St
James
's
gate
,
and
take
a
turn
in
the
park
,
broke
one
of
the
bottles
by
the
way
,
complained
of
the
misfortune
when
I
was
set
down
,
and
desired
that
my
coach
might
be
cleaned
before
my
return
.
<EOS>
While
my
attendants
were
employed
in
this
office
,
I
tripp'd
<EOS>
across
the
parade
to
the
horse
-
guards
,
and
chanced
to
meet
with
an
acquaintance
in
the
park
,
who
said
,
he
saw
by
my
countenance
,
that
I
was
upon
some
expedition
.
<EOS>
I
owned
his
supposition
was
just
;
but
,
as
I
had
not
time
to
relate
particulars
,
I
quickened
my
pace
,
and
took
possession
of
a
hackney
-
coach
,
in
which
I
proceeded
to
the
vehicle
which
I
had
appointed
to
be
in
waiting
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
thus
compassed
my
escape
,
there
was
nothing
but
perplexity
and
confusion
at
home
;
dinner
was
delayed
till
six
o'clock
;
my
lord
ran
half
over
the
town
in
quest
of
his
equipage
,
which
at
last
returned
,
with
an
account
of
my
elopement
.
<EOS>
My
maid
was
brought
to
the
question
,
and
grievously
threatened
;
but
(
like
all
the
women
I
ever
had
)
remained
unshaken
in
her
fidelity
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
I
travelled
night
and
day
towards
my
retreat
in
Lincolnshire
,
of
which
his
lordship
had
not
,
as
yet
,
got
the
least
intelligence
;
and
as
my
coachman
was
but
an
unexperienced
driver
,
I
was
obliged
to
make
use
of
my
own
skill
in
that
exercise
,
and
direct
his
endeavours
the
whole
way
,
without
venturing
to
go
to
bed
,
or
take
the
least
repose
,
until
I
reached
my
own
habitation
,
where
I
lived
in
peace
and
tranquillity
for
the
space
of
six
weeks
,
when
I
was
alarmed
by
one
of
my
lord
's
myrmidons
,
who
came
into
the
neighbourhood
,
blustering
and
swearing
,
that
he
would
carry
me
off
,
either
dead
or
alive
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
I
was
perfectly
easy
,
when
I
was
made
acquainted
with
his
purpose
and
declaration
,
as
my
whole
family
consisted
of
no
more
than
a
couple
of
women
and
one
footman
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
summoned
up
my
courage
,
which
had
been
often
tried
,
and
never
forsook
me
in
the
day
of
danger
;
and
sent
him
word
,
that
if
ever
he
should
presume
to
approach
my
house
,
I
would
order
him
to
be
shot
,
without
ceremony
.
<EOS>
The
fellow
did
not
choose
to
put
me
to
the
trial
,
and
returned
to
town
without
his
errand
.
<EOS>
But
as
the
place
of
my
abode
was
now
discovered
,
I
laid
my
account
with
having
a
visit
from
his
employer
:
    
<EOS>
I
therefore
planted
spies
upon
the
road
,
with
a
promise
of
reward
to
him
who
should
bring
me
the
first
intelligence
of
his
lordship
's
approach
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
was
one
morning
apprized
of
his
coming
;
and
mounting
horse
immediately
,
with
my
woman
and
valet
,
away
we
rode
,
in
defiance
of
winter
,
and
in
two
days
got
through
the
wilds
of
Lincolnshire
and
hundreds
of
Essex
,
crossed
the
river
at
Tilbury
,
breakfasted
at
Chatham
,
by
the
help
of
a
guide
and
moon
-
light
,
arrived
at
Dover
the
same
evening
,
and
embarked
for
Calais
,
in
which
place
I
found
myself
next
day
at
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
;
and
being
heartily
tired
with
my
journey
,
betook
myself
to
rest
.
<EOS>
My
maid
,
who
was
not
able
to
travel
with
such
expedition
,
followed
me
at
an
easier
pace
;
and
the
footman
was
so
astonished
at
my
perseverance
,
that
he
could
not
help
asking
upon
the
road
,
if
ever
I
was
weary
in
my
life
.
<EOS>
Certain
it
is
,
my
spirits
and
resolution
have
enabled
me
to
undergo
fatigues
that
are
almost
incredible
.
<EOS>
From
Calais
I
went
to
Brussels
,
where
I
again
set
up
my
rest
in
private
lodgings
;
was
again
perfectly
well
received
by
the
fashionable
people
of
that
place
;
and
,
by
the
interest
of
my
friends
,
obtained
the
queen
of
Hungary
's
protection
against
the
persecution
of
my
husband
,
while
I
should
reside
in
the
Austrian
Netherlands
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
secured
,
I
lived
uncensured
,
conversing
with
the
English
company
,
with
which
this
city
was
crouded
,
but
spent
the
most
agreeable
part
of
my
time
with
the
countess
of
Calemberg
,
in
whose
house
I
generally
dined
and
supped
;
and
I
also
contracted
an
intimacy
with
the
princess
of
Chemay
,
who
was
a
great
favourite
with
Madam
D'Harrach
,
the
governor
's
lady
.
    
<EOS>
I
had
not
been
long
in
this
happy
situation
,
when
I
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
lord
  
,
who
demanded
me
of
the
governor
;
but
finding
me
sheltered
from
his
power
,
he
set
out
for
Vienna
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
his
representations
,
strengthened
with
the
duke
of
N
#
#
#
#
's
name
,
my
protection
was
withdrawn
.
<EOS>
But
,
before
this
application
,
he
had
gone
to
the
camp
,
and
addressed
himself
to
my
lord
Stair
,
who
was
my
particular
friend
,
and
ally
by
my
first
marriage
,
desiring
he
would
compel
me
to
return
to
his
house
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
told
him
,
that
I
was
in
no
shape
subject
to
his
command
;
but
invited
him
to
dinner
,
with
a
view
of
diverting
himself
and
company
,
at
the
expence
of
his
guest
.
<EOS>
In
the
evening
,
he
was
plied
with
so
many
bumpers
to
my
health
,
that
he
became
intoxicated
,
and
extremely
obstreperous
,
insisted
upon
seeing
lord
Stair
,
after
he
was
retired
to
rest
,
and
quarrelled
with
lord
D
#
#
#
#
,
who
being
a
tall
,
large
,
raw
-
boned
Scotchman
,
could
have
swallowed
him
at
one
mouthful
;
but
he
thought
he
might
venture
to
challenge
him
,
in
hopes
of
being
put
under
arrest
by
the
general
:
though
he
reckoned
without
his
host
;
lord
Stair
knew
his
disposition
,
and
,
in
order
to
punish
his
presumption
,
winked
at
the
affair
.
<EOS>
The
challenger
,
finding
himself
mistaken
in
his
conjecture
,
got
up
early
in
the
morning
,
and
went
off
post
for
Vienna
:
and
lord
Stair
desired
a
certain
man
of
quality
to
make
me
a
visit
,
and
give
me
an
account
of
his
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Being
now
deprived
of
my
protection
and
pin
-
money
,
which
my
generous
husband
would
no
longer
pay
,
I
was
reduced
to
great
difficulty
and
distress
.
    
<EOS>
The
duchess
D'Aremberg
,
lord
G
#
#
#
#
,
and
many
other
persons
of
distinction
,
interceded
in
my
behalf
with
his
majesty
,
who
was
then
abroad
;
<EOS>
but
he
refused
to
interpose
between
man
and
wife
.
<EOS>
The
countess
of
Calemberg
wrote
a
letter
to
my
father
,
in
which
she
represented
my
uncomfortable
situation
,
and
undertook
to
answer
for
my
conduct
,
in
case
he
would
allow
me
a
small
annuity
,
on
which
I
could
live
independant
of
lord
  
,
who
,
by
all
accounts
,
was
a
wretch
with
whom
I
could
never
enjoy
the
least
happiness
or
quiet
;
otherwise
,
she
would
be
the
first
to
advise
me
to
an
accommodation
.
<EOS>
She
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
her
character
was
neither
doubtful
nor
obscure
;
and
that
if
my
conduct
there
had
not
been
irreproachable
,
she
should
not
have
taken
me
under
her
protection
:
that
as
I
proposed
to
board
in
a
convent
,
a
small
sum
would
answer
my
occasions
;
but
,
if
that
should
be
denied
,
I
would
actually
go
to
service
,
or
take
some
other
desperate
step
,
to
avoid
the
man
who
was
my
bane
and
aversion
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
kind
remonstrance
my
father
answered
,
that
his
fortune
would
not
allow
him
to
assist
me
;
he
had
now
a
young
family
;
and
that
I
ought
,
at
all
events
,
to
return
to
my
husband
.
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
such
was
the
extremity
of
my
circumstances
,
that
I
was
forced
to
pawn
my
cloaths
,
and
every
trifling
trinket
in
my
possession
,
and
even
to
descend
so
far
as
to
sollicit
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
for
a
loan
of
fifty
pounds
,
which
he
refused
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
was
I
deserted
,
in
my
distress
,
by
two
persons
,
to
whom
,
in
the
season
of
my
affluence
,
my
purse
had
been
always
open
.
    
<EOS>
Nothing
so
effectually
subdues
a
spirit
unused
to
supplicate
,
as
want
:
repulsed
in
this
manner
,
I
had
recourse
to
lord
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
also
(
it
seems
)
unable
to
relieve
my
necessities
.
<EOS>
This
mortification
I
deserved
at
his
hands
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
had
once
put
it
in
my
power
to
be
above
all
such
paultry
demands
;
and
I
should
not
have
been
compelled
to
the
disagreeable
task
of
troubling
my
friends
,
had
not
I
voluntarily
resigned
what
he
formerly
gave
me
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
other
gentleman
to
whom
I
addressed
myself
,
on
this
occasion
,
I
think
he
might
have
shewn
more
regard
to
my
application
,
not
only
for
the
reasons
already
mentioned
,
but
because
he
knew
me
too
well
to
be
ignorant
of
what
I
must
have
suffered
,
in
condescending
to
make
such
a
request
.
    
<EOS>
Several
officers
,
who
guess'd
my
adversity
,
generously
offered
to
supply
me
with
money
;
but
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
make
use
of
their
friendship
,
or
even
to
own
my
distress
,
except
to
one
person
,
of
whom
I
borrowed
a
small
sum
.
<EOS>
To
crown
my
misfortunes
,
I
was
taken
very
ill
,
at
a
time
when
there
was
no
other
way
of
avoiding
the
clutches
of
my
persecutor
,
but
by
a
precipitate
flight
.
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
,
I
applied
to
a
worthy
gentleman
of
Brussels
,
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
,
but
no
lover
.
<EOS>
I
say
no
lover
,
because
every
man
is
supposed
to
act
in
that
capacity
who
befriends
a
young
woman
in
distress
.
<EOS>
This
generous
Fleming
set
out
with
me
,
in
the
night
,
from
Brussels
,
and
conducted
me
to
the
frontiers
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
Being
very
much
indisposed
both
in
mind
and
body
when
I
was
obliged
to
undertake
this
expedition
,
I
should
,
in
all
probability
,
have
sunk
under
the
fatigue
of
travelling
,
had
not
my
spirits
been
kept
up
by
the
conversation
of
my
companion
,
who
was
a
man
of
business
and
consequence
,
and
undertook
to
manage
my
affairs
in
such
a
manner
as
would
enable
me
to
re
-
establish
my
residence
in
the
place
I
had
left
.
<EOS>
He
was
young
and
active
,
attended
me
with
the
utmost
care
and
assiduity
,
and
left
nothing
undone
which
he
thought
would
contribute
to
my
ease
and
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
I
believe
his
friendship
for
me
was
a
little
tinctured
with
another
passion
;
but
he
was
married
,
and
lived
very
well
with
his
wife
,
who
was
also
my
friend
;
so
that
he
knew
I
would
never
think
of
him
in
the
light
of
a
lover
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
our
arrival
at
Valenciennes
,
he
accommodated
me
with
a
little
money
(
for
a
little
was
all
I
would
take
)
and
returned
to
his
own
city
,
after
we
had
settled
a
correspondence
by
letters
.
<EOS>
I
was
detained
a
day
or
two
in
this
place
by
my
indisposition
,
which
increased
;
but
nevertheless
proceeded
to
Paris
,
to
make
interest
for
a
protection
from
the
king
of
France
,
which
that
monarch
graciously
accorded
me
,
in
three
days
after
my
first
application
;
and
his
minister
sent
orders
to
all
the
governors
and
intendants
of
the
province
towns
,
to
protect
me
against
the
efforts
of
lord
  
,
in
whatever
place
I
should
choose
to
reside
.
    
<EOS>
Having
returned
my
thanks
at
Versailles
for
this
favour
,
and
tarried
a
few
days
at
Paris
,
which
was
a
place
altogether
unsuitable
to
the
low
ebb
of
my
fortune
,
I
repaired
to
Lisle
,
where
I
intended
to
fix
my
habitation
;
and
there
my
disorder
recurred
with
such
violence
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
send
for
a
physician
,
who
seemed
to
have
been
a
disciple
of
Sangrado
;
for
he
scarce
left
a
drop
of
blood
in
my
body
,
and
yet
I
found
myself
never
a
whit
the
better
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
I
was
so
much
exhausted
by
these
evacuations
,
and
my
constitution
so
much
impaired
by
fatigue
and
perturbation
of
mind
<EOS>
,
that
I
had
no
other
hope
of
recovering
but
<EOS>
that
of
reaching
England
,
and
putting
myself
under
the
direction
of
a
physician
on
whose
ability
I
could
depend
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
doubtful
prospect
,
therefore
,
I
determined
to
attempt
a
return
to
my
native
air
,
and
actually
departed
from
Lisle
,
in
such
a
melancholy
enfeebled
condition
,
that
I
had
almost
fainted
when
I
was
put
into
the
coach
.
<EOS>
But
before
I
resolved
upon
this
journey
I
was
reduced
to
the
utmost
exigence
of
fortune
;
so
that
I
could
scarce
afford
to
buy
provisions
,
had
it
been
in
my
power
to
eat
,
and
should
not
have
been
able
to
defray
my
travelling
expences
,
had
I
not
been
generously
befriended
by
lord
R
#
#
#
#
M
#
#
#
#
who
(
I
am
sure
)
would
have
done
any
thing
for
my
ease
and
accommodation
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
has
unjustly
incurred
the
imputation
of
being
parsimonious
,
and
I
had
no
reason
to
expect
any
such
favour
at
his
hands
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
deplorable
state
of
health
I
was
conveyed
to
Calais
,
being
all
the
way
(
as
it
were
)
in
the
arms
of
death
,
without
having
swallowed
the
least
sustenance
on
the
road
;
and
so
much
was
my
indisposition
augmented
by
the
fatigue
of
the
journey
,
that
I
swooned
when
I
was
brought
into
the
inn
,
and
had
almost
expired
before
I
could
receive
the
least
assistance
or
advice
:
<EOS>
however
,
my
spirits
were
a
little
revived
by
some
bread
and
wine
,
which
I
took
at
the
persuasion
of
a
French
surgeon
,
who
chancing
to
pass
by
the
door
,
was
called
up
to
my
relief
;
and
having
sent
my
servant
to
Brussels
to
take
care
of
my
cloaths
,
embarked
in
the
packet
-
boat
,
and
by
that
time
we
arrived
at
Dover
,
was
almost
in
extremity
.
    
<EOS>
Here
I
found
a
return
coach
,
in
which
I
was
carried
to
London
,
and
was
put
to
bed
in
the
house
at
which
we
put
up
,
more
dead
than
alive
.
<EOS>
The
people
of
the
inn
sent
for
an
apothecary
,
who
administred
some
cordial
that
recalled
me
to
life
;
and
when
I
recovered
the
use
of
speech
,
I
told
him
who
I
was
,
and
desired
him
to
wait
upon
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
and
inform
him
of
my
situation
.
<EOS>
A
young
girl
who
was
niece
to
the
landlord
's
wife
,
seeing
me
unattended
,
made
a
tender
of
her
service
to
me
,
and
I
accepted
the
offer
,
as
well
as
of
a
lodging
in
the
apothecary
's
house
,
to
which
I
was
conveyed
as
soon
as
my
strength
would
admit
of
my
removal
;
and
there
was
visited
by
my
physician
,
who
was
shocked
to
find
me
in
such
a
dangerous
condition
:
however
,
having
considered
my
case
,
he
perceived
that
my
indisposition
proceeded
from
the
calamities
I
had
undergone
,
and
encouraged
me
with
the
hope
of
a
speedy
cure
,
<EOS>
provided
I
could
be
kept
easy
and
undisturbed
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
accordingly
tended
with
all
imaginable
care
;
my
lord
's
name
being
never
mentioned
in
my
hearing
,
because
I
considered
him
as
the
fatal
source
of
all
my
misfortunes
;
and
in
a
month
I
recovered
my
health
,
by
the
great
skill
and
tenderness
of
my
doctor
,
who
now
finding
me
strong
enough
to
encounter
fresh
troubles
,
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
,
that
it
would
be
my
wisest
step
to
return
to
my
husband
,
whom
,
at
that
time
,
he
had
often
occasion
to
see
.
<EOS>
But
I
rejected
his
proposal
,
commenced
a
new
lawsuit
for
separation
,
and
took
a
small
house
in
St
James
's
Square
.
    
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
my
woman
returned
from
Brussels
,
but
without
my
cloaths
,
which
were
detained
on
account
of
the
money
I
owed
in
that
place
;
and
asking
her
dismission
from
my
service
,
set
up
shop
for
herself
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
lived
many
weeks
in
my
new
habitation
,
when
my
persecutor
renewed
his
attempts
to
make
himself
master
of
my
person
;
but
I
had
learn'd
from
experience
,
to
redouble
my
vigilance
,
and
he
was
frustrated
in
all
his
endeavours
.
<EOS>
I
was
again
happy
in
the
conversation
of
my
former
acquaintance
,
and
visited
by
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
,
mostly
persons
of
probity
and
sense
,
who
cultivated
my
friendship
,
without
any
other
motive
of
attachment
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
was
unsolicited
on
the
article
of
love
;
that
was
a
theme
on
which
I
never
wanted
orators
;
and
could
I
have
prevailed
upon
myself
to
profit
by
the
advances
that
were
made
,
I
might
have
managed
my
opportunities
,
so
as
to
have
set
fortune
at
defiance
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
But
I
was
none
of
those
oeconomists
,
who
can
sacrifice
their
hearts
to
interested
considerations
.
    
<EOS>
One
evening
,
while
I
was
conversing
with
three
or
four
of
my
friends
,
my
lawyer
came
in
,
and
told
me
he
had
something
of
consequence
to
impart
:
upon
which
,
all
the
gentlemen
but
one
went
away
;
and
he
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
my
suit
would
immediately
come
to
trial
;
and
though
he
hoped
the
best
,
the
issue
was
uncertain
:
that
if
it
should
be
given
against
me
,
the
decision
would
inspire
my
lord
with
fresh
spirits
to
disturb
my
peace
;
and
therefore
it
would
be
convenient
for
me
to
retire
,
until
the
affair
should
be
brought
to
a
determination
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
very
much
disconcerted
at
this
intelligence
;
and
the
gentleman
who
stayed
perceiving
my
concern
,
asked
what
I
intended
to
do
,
or
if
he
could
serve
me
in
any
shape
,
and
desired
to
know
whither
I
proposed
to
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
affected
to
laugh
,
and
answered
,
"
To
a
garret
I
believe
.
<EOS>
"
To
this
over
-
strained
raillery
he
replied
,
that
if
I
should
,
his
friendship
and
regard
would
find
the
way
to
my
apartment
;
and
I
had
no
reason
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
his
declaration
.
<EOS>
We
consulted
about
the
measures
I
should
take
,
and
I
determined
to
remove
into
the
country
,
where
I
was
soon
favoured
with
a
letter
from
him
,
wherein
he
expressed
the
infinite
pleasure
he
had
,
in
being
able
to
assure
me
,
that
my
suit
had
been
successful
,
and
that
I
might
appear
again
with
great
safety
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
I
returned
to
town
in
his
coach
and
six
,
which
he
had
sent
for
my
convenience
,
and
the
same
evening
went
with
him
to
the
masquerade
,
where
we
passed
the
night
very
agreeably
,
his
spirits
,
as
well
as
mine
,
being
elevated
to
a
joyous
pitch
,
by
the
happy
event
of
my
process
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
was
a
person
of
great
honour
,
worth
and
good
nature
;
he
loved
me
extremely
,
but
did
not
care
that
I
should
know
the
extent
of
his
passion
:
on
the
contrary
,
he
endeavoured
to
persuade
me
,
he
had
laid
it
down
as
a
maxim
,
that
no
woman
should
ever
have
power
enough
over
his
heart
,
to
give
him
the
least
pain
or
disquiet
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
had
made
a
progress
in
my
affection
,
and
to
his
generosity
was
I
indebted
for
my
subsistence
two
whole
years
;
during
which
,
he
was
continually
professing
this
philosophic
indifference
,
while
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
was
giving
me
daily
assurances
of
his
friendship
and
esteem
,
and
treating
me
with
incessant
marks
of
the
most
passionate
love
:
<EOS>
so
that
I
concluded
his
intention
was
cold
,
though
his
temper
was
warm
;
and
considering
myself
as
an
incumbrance
upon
his
fortune
,
I
redoubled
my
endeavours
to
obtain
a
separate
maintenance
from
my
lord
,
and
removed
from
St
James
's
Square
to
lodgings
at
Kensington
,
where
I
had
not
long
enjoyed
myself
in
tranquillity
,
before
it
was
interrupted
by
a
very
unexpected
visit
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
was
busy
one
day
dressing
in
my
dining
-
room
,
I
found
his
lordship
at
my
elbow
,
before
I
was
aware
of
his
approach
,
although
his
coach
was
at
the
door
,
and
the
house
already
in
the
possession
of
his
servants
.
<EOS>
He
accosted
me
in
the
usual
stile
,
as
if
we
had
parted
the
night
before
;
and
I
answered
him
with
an
appearance
of
the
same
careless
familiarity
,
desiring
him
to
sit
down
,
while
I
retreated
to
my
chamber
,
<EOS>
lock'd
<EOS>
the
door
,
and
fairly
went
to
bed
;
being
,
perhaps
,
the
first
woman
who
went
thither
for
protection
from
the
insults
of
a
man
.
<EOS>
Here
then
I
immured
myself
with
my
faithful
Abigail
;
and
my
lord
finding
me
secured
,
knocked
at
the
door
,
and
through
the
key
-
hole
begg'd
to
be
admitted
;
assuring
me
,
that
all
he
wanted
was
a
conference
.
<EOS>
I
desired
to
be
excused
,
though
I
believed
his
assurance
;
but
I
had
no
inclination
to
converse
with
him
,
because
I
knew
from
experience
the
nature
of
his
conversation
,
which
was
so
disagreeable
and
tormenting
,
that
I
would
have
exchanged
it
at
any
time
for
a
good
beating
,
and
thought
myself
a
gainer
by
the
bargain
.
    
<EOS>
However
,
he
persisted
in
his
importunities
to
such
a
degree
,
that
I
assented
to
his
proposal
,
on
condition
that
the
duke
of
L
#
#
#
#
should
be
present
at
the
interview
;
and
he
immediately
sent
a
message
to
his
grace
,
while
I
in
peace
ate
my
breakfast
,
conveyed
in
a
basket
,
which
was
hoisted
up
to
the
window
of
my
bed
-
chamber
.
    
<EOS>
The
duke
was
so
kind
as
to
come
at
my
lord
's
request
,
and
before
I
would
open
the
door
,
gave
me
his
word
,
that
I
should
be
protected
from
all
violence
and
compulsion
.
<EOS>
Thus
assured
,
they
were
permitted
to
enter
;
and
my
little
gentleman
sitting
down
by
the
bed
-
side
,
began
to
repeat
the
old
hackneyed
arguments
he
had
formerly
used
,
with
the
view
of
inducing
me
to
live
with
him
;
and
I
,
on
my
side
,
repeated
my
former
objections
,
or
pretended
to
listen
to
his
representations
,
while
my
imagination
was
employed
in
contriving
the
means
of
effecting
an
escape
,
as
the
duke
easily
perceived
by
my
countenance
.
    
<EOS>
Finding
all
his
remonstrances
ineffectual
,
he
quitted
the
chamber
,
and
left
his
cause
to
the
eloquence
of
his
grace
,
who
sat
with
me
a
whole
half
hour
,
without
exerting
himself
much
in
behalf
of
his
client
,
because
he
knew
I
was
altogether
obstinate
,
and
determined
on
that
score
;
but
joked
upon
the
behaviour
of
his
lordship
,
who
(
though
jealous
of
most
people
)
had
left
him
alone
with
me
in
my
bed
-
chamber
,
observing
,
that
he
must
either
have
great
confidence
in
his
virtue
,
or
a
very
bad
opinion
of
him
otherwise
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
found
means
to
defer
the
categorical
answer
till
next
day
,
and
invited
the
duke
and
his
lordship
to
dine
with
me
to
-
morrow
.
    
<EOS>
My
wife
yoke
-
fellow
seemed
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
this
invitation
,
and
was
very
much
disposed
to
keep
possession
of
my
fort
:
but
,
by
the
persuasions
of
his
grace
,
and
the
advice
of
H####n
,
who
was
his
chief
counsellor
and
back
,
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
take
my
word
,
and
for
the
present
left
me
.
    
<EOS>
They
were
no
sooner
retired
,
than
I
rose
with
great
expedition
,
pack'd
<EOS>
up
my
cloaths
,
and
took
shelter
in
Essex
for
the
first
time
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
my
lord
and
his
noble
friend
came
to
dinner
,
according
to
appointment
;
and
being
informed
of
my
escape
by
my
woman
,
whom
I
had
left
in
the
house
,
his
lordship
discovered
some
signs
of
discontent
,
and
insisted
upon
seeing
my
papers
;
upon
which
,
my
maid
produced
a
parcel
of
bills
which
I
owed
to
different
people
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
disappointment
,
he
sat
down
to
what
was
provided
for
dinner
,
and
with
great
deliberation
ate
up
a
leg
of
lamb
,
the
best
part
of
a
fowl
,
and
something
else
,
which
I
do
not
now
remember
;
and
then
very
peaceably
went
away
,
giving
my
maid
an
opportunity
of
following
me
to
the
place
of
my
retreat
.
    
<EOS>
My
intention
was
to
have
sought
refuge
,
as
formerly
,
in
another
country
;
but
I
was
prevented
from
putting
my
design
in
execution
by
a
fit
of
illness
,
during
which
I
was
visited
by
my
physician
and
some
of
my
own
relations
,
particularly
a
distant
cousin
of
mine
,
whom
my
lord
had
engaged
in
his
interests
,
by
promising
to
recompence
her
amply
,
if
she
could
persuade
me
to
comply
with
his
desire
.
<EOS>
In
this
office
she
was
assisted
by
the
doctor
,
who
was
my
friend
,
and
a
man
of
sense
,
for
whom
I
have
the
most
perfect
esteem
,
though
he
and
I
have
often
differed
in
point
of
opinion
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
I
was
exposed
to
the
incessant
importunities
of
all
my
acquaintance
,
which
,
added
to
the
desperate
circumstances
of
my
fortune
,
compelled
me
to
embrace
the
terms
that
were
offered
,
and
I
again
returned
to
the
domestic
duties
of
a
wife
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
conducted
to
my
lord
's
house
by
an
old
friend
of
mine
,
a
gentleman
turned
of
fifty
,
of
admirable
parts
and
understanding
;
he
was
a
pleasing
companion
,
chearful
and
humane
,
and
had
acquired
a
great
share
of
my
esteem
and
respect
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
his
advice
had
great
weight
in
my
deliberations
,
because
it
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
experience
and
disinterested
friendship
.
<EOS>
Without
all
doubt
,
he
had
an
unfeigned
concern
for
my
welfare
;
but
,
being
an
admirable
politician
,
his
scheme
was
to
make
my
interest
coincide
with
his
own
inclinations
;
for
I
had
unwittingly
made
an
innovation
upon
his
heart
;
and
as
he
thought
I
should
hardly
favour
his
passion
,
while
I
was
at
liberty
to
converse
with
the
rest
of
my
admirers
,
he
counselled
me
to
surrender
that
freedom
,
well
knowing
that
my
lord
would
be
easily
persuaded
to
banish
all
his
rivals
from
the
house
;
in
which
case
,
he
did
not
doubt
of
his
being
able
to
insinuate
himself
into
my
affections
;
because
he
laid
it
down
as
an
eternal
truth
,
that
if
any
two
persons
of
different
sexes
were
obliged
to
live
together
in
a
desart
,
where
they
would
be
excluded
from
all
other
human
intercourse
,
they
would
naturally
and
inevitably
contract
an
inclination
for
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
How
just
this
hypothesis
may
be
,
I
leave
to
the
determination
of
the
curious
;
though
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
judge
from
my
own
disposition
,
a
couple
so
situated
would
be
apt
to
imbibe
mutual
disgusts
,
from
the
nature
and
necessity
of
their
union
;
unless
their
association
was
at
first
the
effect
of
reciprocal
affection
and
esteem
.
    
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
will
,
I
honour
the
gentleman
man
for
his
plan
,
which
was
ingeniously
contrived
,
and
artfully
conducted
:
but
I
happened
to
have
too
much
address
for
him
in
the
sequel
,
cunning
as
he
was
,
though
at
first
I
did
not
perceive
his
drift
;
and
his
lordship
was
much
less
likely
to
comprehend
his
meaning
.
    
<EOS>
Immediately
after
this
new
accommodation
,
I
was
carried
to
a
country
-
house
belonging
to
my
lord
,
and
was
simple
enough
to
venture
myself
(
unattended
by
any
servant
on
whose
integrity
I
could
depend
)
in
the
hands
of
his
lordship
and
H####n
,
whose
villainy
I
always
dreaded
;
tho
'
at
this
time
my
apprehensions
were
considerably
increased
,
by
recollecting
,
that
it
was
not
his
interest
to
let
me
live
in
the
house
,
lest
his
conduct
should
be
inquired
into
;
and
by
remembering
,
that
the
very
house
to
which
we
were
going
,
had
been
twice
burnt
down
in
a
very
short
space
of
time
,
not
without
suspicion
of
his
having
been
the
incendiary
,
on
account
of
some
box
of
writings
,
which
was
lost
in
the
conflagration
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
this
imputation
was
never
made
good
;
and
perhaps
he
was
altogether
innocent
of
the
charge
,
which
nevertheless
affected
my
spirits
in
such
a
manner
,
as
rendered
me
the
most
miserable
of
all
mortals
;
and
in
this
terror
did
I
remain
,
till
my
consternation
was
weakened
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Bal
#
#
#
#
,
a
good
natured
worthy
man
,
whom
my
lord
had
invited
to
his
house
,
and
I
thought
would
not
see
me
ill
used
;
and
in
a
few
weeks
,
we
were
joined
by
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
and
his
lady
,
who
visited
us
according
to
their
promise
;
and
it
was
resolved
that
we
should
set
out
for
Tunbridge
,
on
a
partie
of
pleasure
,
and
at
our
return
examine
H####n
's
accounts
.
    
<EOS>
This
last
part
of
our
scheme
was
not
all
relished
by
our
worthy
steward
,
who
,
therefore
,
determined
to
overturn
our
whole
plan
,
and
succeeded
accordingly
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
declared
himself
against
the
jaunt
we
had
projected
,
and
insisted
upon
my
staying
at
home
,
without
assigning
any
reason
for
this
peremptory
behaviour
;
his
countenance
became
cloudy
,
and
for
the
space
of
three
days
he
did
not
open
his
mouth
.
    
<EOS>
At
last
,
he
one
night
entered
my
bed
-
chamber
,
to
which
he
now
had
free
access
,
with
his
sword
under
his
arm
,
and
,
if
I
remember
aright
,
it
was
ready
drawn
.
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
taking
notice
of
this
alarming
circumstance
,
which
shocked
me
the
more
,
as
it
happened
immediately
after
a
gloomy
fit
of
discontent
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
seemed
to
overlook
the
incident
,
and
dismissing
my
maid
,
went
to
bed
;
because
I
was
ashamed
to
acknowledge
,
even
to
my
own
heart
,
any
dread
of
a
person
whom
I
despised
so
much
.
<EOS>
However
,
the
strength
of
my
constitution
was
not
equal
to
the
fortitude
of
my
mind
:
<EOS>
I
was
taken
ill
,
and
the
servants
were
obliged
to
be
called
up
;
while
my
lord
himself
,
terrified
at
my
situation
,
ran
up
stairs
to
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
in
bed
,
told
her
,
with
evident
perturbation
of
spirits
,
that
I
was
very
much
indisposed
,
and
said
,
he
believed
I
was
frightened
by
his
entering
my
chamber
with
his
sword
in
hand
.
    
<EOS>
This
lady
was
so
startled
at
his
information
,
that
she
ran
into
my
apartment
half
-
naked
,
and
as
she
went
down
stairs
,
asked
what
reason
could
induce
him
to
have
carried
his
sword
with
him
?
<EOS>
Upon
which
he
gave
her
to
understand
,
that
his
intention
was
to
kill
the
bats
.
    
<EOS>
I
believe
and
hope
he
had
no
other
design
than
that
of
intimidating
me
,
but
when
the
affair
happened
,
I
was
of
a
different
opinion
.
<EOS>
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
having
put
on
her
cloaths
,
sat
up
all
night
by
my
bed
-
side
,
and
was
so
good
as
to
assure
me
,
that
she
would
not
leave
me
,
until
I
should
be
safely
delivered
from
the
apprehensions
that
surrounded
me
in
this
house
,
to
which
she
and
the
doctor
had
been
the
principal
cause
of
my
coming
;
for
my
lord
had
haunted
and
importuned
them
incessantly
on
this
subject
,
protesting
that
he
loved
me
with
the
most
inviolable
affection
;
and
all
he
desired
was
,
that
I
would
sit
at
his
table
,
manage
his
family
,
and
share
his
fortune
.
<EOS>
By
these
professions
,
uttered
with
an
air
of
honesty
and
good
-
nature
,
he
had
imposed
himself
upon
them
,
for
the
best
tempered
creature
upon
earth
;
and
they
used
all
their
influence
with
me
to
take
him
into
favour
.
<EOS>
This
hath
been
the
case
with
a
great
many
people
,
who
had
but
a
superficial
knowledge
of
his
disposition
;
but
,
in
the
course
of
their
acquaintance
,
they
have
never
failed
to
discern
and
acknowledge
their
mistake
.
    
<EOS>
The
doctor
,
on
his
return
from
Tunbridge
,
to
which
place
he
had
made
a
trip
by
himself
,
found
me
ill
a
-
bed
,
and
the
whole
family
in
confusion
:
surprized
and
concerned
at
this
disorder
,
he
entered
into
expostulation
with
my
lord
,
who
owned
,
that
the
cause
of
his
displeasure
and
disquiet
was
no
other
than
jealousy
:
H
#
#
#
#
had
informed
him
,
that
I
had
been
seen
to
walk
out
with
Mr
Bal
#
#
#
#
in
a
morning
;
and
that
our
correspondence
had
been
observed
with
many
additional
circumstances
,
which
were
absolutely
false
and
groundless
.
    
<EOS>
This
imputation
was
no
sooner
understood
,
than
it
was
resolved
that
the
accuser
should
be
examined
,
in
presence
of
us
all
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
appeared
,
exceedingly
drunk
,
tho
'
<EOS>
it
was
morning
,
and
repeated
the
articles
of
the
charge
,
as
an
information
he
had
received
from
a
man
who
came
from
town
to
hang
the
bells
,
and
was
long
ago
returned
to
London
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
an
instance
of
his
cunning
and
address
,
which
did
not
forsake
him
even
in
his
hours
of
intoxication
.
<EOS>
Had
he
fixed
the
calumny
on
any
one
of
the
servants
,
he
would
have
been
confronted
and
detected
in
his
falshood
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
tho
'
he
could
not
be
legally
convicted
,
it
plainly
appeared
that
he
was
the
author
of
this
defamation
,
which
incensed
Mr
Bal
#
#
#
#
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
could
scarce
be
with
-
held
from
punishing
him
on
the
spot
,
by
manual
chastisement
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
abstain
from
such
immediate
vengeance
,
as
a
step
unworthy
of
his
character
;
and
the
affair
was
brought
to
this
issue
,
that
his
lordship
should
either
part
with
me
or
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
for
I
was
fully
determined
against
living
under
the
same
roof
with
such
an
incendiary
.
    
<EOS>
This
alternative
being
proposed
,
my
lord
dismiss'd
<EOS>
his
steward
,
and
we
returned
to
town
with
the
doctor
and
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
;
for
I
had
imbibed
such
horror
and
aversion
for
this
country
seat
<EOS>
(
tho
'
one
of
the
pleasantest
in
England
)
that
I
could
not
bear
to
live
in
it
.
    
<EOS>
We
therefore
removed
to
an
house
in
Bond
-
street
,
where
,
according
to
the
advice
of
my
friends
,
I
exerted
my
whole
power
and
complaisance
,
in
endeavours
to
keep
my
husband
in
good
humour
;
but
was
so
unsuccessful
in
my
attempts
,
that
if
ever
he
was
worse
tempered
,
more
capricious
,
or
intolerable
,
at
one
time
than
at
another
,
this
was
the
season
in
which
his
ill
-
humour
predominated
to
the
most
rancorous
degree
.
<EOS>
I
was
scarce
ever
permitted
to
stir
abroad
,
saw
no
-
body
at
home
<EOS>
but
my
old
male
-
friend
whom
I
have
mentioned
above
,
and
the
doctor
with
his
lady
,
from
whose
conversation
also
I
was
at
last
excluded
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
contrived
to
steal
a
meeting
,
now
and
then
,
with
my
late
benefactor
,
for
whom
I
entertained
a
great
share
of
affection
,
exclusive
of
that
gratitude
which
was
due
to
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
his
fault
that
I
compromised
matters
with
my
lord
;
for
he
was
as
free
of
his
purse
as
I
was
unwilling
to
use
it
.
<EOS>
It
would
,
therefore
,
have
been
unfriendly
,
unkind
,
and
ungrateful
in
me
(
now
that
I
was
in
affluence
)
to
avoid
all
intercourse
with
a
man
who
had
supported
me
in
adversity
.
  
<EOS>
I
think
people
can
not
be
too
shy
and
scrupulous
in
receiving
favours
;
but
once
they
are
conferred
,
they
ought
never
to
forget
the
obligation
:
and
I
was
never
more
concerned
at
any
incident
of
my
life
,
than
at
hearing
that
this
gentleman
did
not
receive
a
letter
,
in
which
I
acknowledged
the
last
proof
of
his
friendship
and
liberality
which
I
had
occasion
to
use
,
because
I
have
since
learned
,
that
he
suspected
me
of
neglect
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
to
return
to
my
situation
in
Bond
-
street
,
I
bore
it
as
well
as
I
could
for
the
space
of
three
months
,
during
which
I
lived
in
the
midst
of
spies
who
were
employed
to
watch
my
conduct
;
and
underwent
every
mortification
that
malice
,
power
,
and
folly
could
inflict
.
    
<EOS>
Nay
,
so
ridiculous
,
so
unreasonable
was
my
tyrant
in
his
spleen
,
that
he
declared
he
would
even
be
jealous
of
Heydigger
,
if
there
was
no
other
man
to
incur
his
suspicion
<EOS>
:
he
expected
that
I
should
spend
my
whole
time
with
him
,
tte
a
tte
;
and
when
I
sacrificed
my
enjoyment
to
these
comfortable
parties
,
he
never
failed
to
lay
hold
on
some
innocent
expression
of
mine
,
which
he
made
the
foundation
of
a
quarrel
;
and
when
I
strove
to
avoid
these
disagreeable
misinterpretations
,
by
reading
or
writing
,
he
incessantly
teized
and
tormented
me
with
the
imputation
of
being
peevish
,
sullen
and
reserved
.
    
<EOS>
Harrassed
by
this
insufferable
behaviour
,
I
communicated
my
case
to
Dr
S
#
#
#
#
and
his
lady
,
intimating
that
I
neither
could
nor
would
expose
myself
any
longer
to
such
usage
.
<EOS>
The
doctor
exhorted
me
to
bear
my
fate
with
patience
,
and
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
was
silent
on
the
subject
;
so
that
I
still
hesitated
between
staying
and
going
,
when
the
doctor
being
one
night
at
supper
,
happened
to
have
some
words
with
my
lord
,
who
was
so
violently
transported
with
passion
,
that
I
was
actually
afraid
of
going
to
bed
with
him
;
and
next
morning
when
he
waked
,
there
was
such
an
expression
of
frantic
wildness
in
his
countenance
,
<EOS>
that
I
imagined
he
was
actually
distracted
.
    
<EOS>
This
alarming
circumstance
confirmed
me
in
my
resolution
of
decamping
;
and
I
accordingly
moved
my
quarters
to
an
house
in
Sackville
-
street
,
where
I
had
lodged
when
I
was
a
widow
;
and
when
I
was
settled
,
sent
a
message
to
the
duke
of
L
#
#
#
#
,
desiring
he
would
make
my
lord
acquainted
with
the
place
of
my
abode
,
my
reasons
for
removing
,
and
my
intention
to
defend
myself
against
all
his
attempts
.
<EOS>
The
first
night
of
this
separation
I
went
to
bed
by
myself
,
with
as
much
pleasure
as
a
man
could
do
in
going
to
bed
to
his
mistress
,
whom
he
had
long
solicited
in
vain
.
<EOS>
So
rejoiced
was
I
to
be
delivered
from
my
obnoxious
bedfellow
!
    
<EOS>
I
had
not
long
changed
my
lodgings
,
which
I
did
to
Brook
-
street
,
and
enjoyed
the
sweets
of
my
escape
,
when
I
was
importuned
to
return
,
by
a
new
steward
whom
my
lord
had
engaged
in
the
room
of
H####n
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
who
bore
a
very
fair
character
,
made
such
judicious
representations
,
and
behaved
so
candidly
in
the
discharge
of
his
function
,
that
I
agreed
he
should
act
as
umpire
in
the
difference
between
us
;
and
once
more
a
reconciliation
was
effected
,
tho
'
his
lordship
began
to
be
dissatisfied
even
before
the
execution
of
our
agreement
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
attended
me
to
Bath
,
whither
I
went
for
the
benefit
of
my
health
,
which
was
not
a
little
impaired
.
    
<EOS>
This
accommodation
had
a
surprising
effect
upon
my
lover
,
who
,
notwithstanding
his
repeated
declarations
,
that
no
woman
should
ever
gain
such
an
ascendency
over
his
heart
,
as
to
be
able
to
give
him
pain
,
suffered
all
the
agonies
of
disappointed
love
,
when
he
now
found
himself
deprived
of
the
opportunities
of
seeing
me
,
and
behaved
very
differently
from
what
he
had
imagined
he
should
:
his
words
and
actions
were
desperate
;
one
of
his
expressions
to
me
was
,
"
It
is
like
twisting
my
heart
-
strings
,
and
tearing
it
out
of
my
body
.
"
<EOS>
And
I
should
never
have
done
it
,
<EOS>
had
I
thought
he
would
have
suffered
;
but
I
protest
I
believed
him
when
he
said
otherwise
so
much
,
that
it
was
the
occasion
of
my
giving
him
up
;
and
it
was
now
too
late
to
retract
.
    
<EOS>
In
our
expedition
to
the
Bath
<EOS>
I
was
accompanied
by
a
very
agreeable
young
lady
,
with
whom
I
pass'd
my
time
very
happily
,
amid
the
diversions
of
the
place
,
which
screened
me
,
in
a
good
measure
,
from
the
vexatious
society
of
my
hopeful
partner
.
<EOS>
From
this
place
we
repaired
to
his
seat
in
the
country
,
where
we
spent
a
few
months
,
and
thence
returned
again
to
our
house
in
Bond
-
street
.
<EOS>
Here
,
while
I
was
confined
to
my
bed
by
illness
,
it
was
supposed
my
indisposition
was
no
other
than
a
private
lying
in
<EOS>
,
tho
'
I
was
under
the
roof
with
my
lord
,
and
attended
by
his
servants
.
    
<EOS>
While
my
distemper
continued
,
my
lord
(
to
do
him
justice
)
behaved
with
all
imaginable
tenderness
and
care
;
and
his
concern
on
these
occasions
I
have
already
mentioned
,
as
a
strange
inconsistency
in
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
If
his
actions
were
at
all
accountable
,
I
should
think
he
took
pains
to
fret
me
into
a
fever
first
,
in
order
to
manifest
his
love
and
humanity
afterwards
.
<EOS>
When
I
recovered
my
strength
and
spirits
,
I
went
abroad
,
saw
company
,
and
should
have
been
easy
,
had
he
been
contented
;
but
as
my
satisfaction
increased
,
his
good
humour
decayed
,
and
he
banished
,
from
his
house
,
one
by
one
,
all
the
people
whose
conversation
could
have
made
my
life
agreeable
.
    
<EOS>
I
often
expostulated
with
him
upon
this
malignant
behaviour
,
protesting
my
desire
of
living
peaceably
with
him
;
and
begging
he
would
not
lay
me
under
the
necessity
of
changing
my
measures
.
<EOS>
He
was
deaf
to
all
my
remonstrances
,
(
tho
'
I
warned
him
more
than
once
of
the
event
)
persisted
in
his
maxims
of
persecution
;
and
,
after
repeated
quarrels
,
I
again
left
his
house
,
fully
determined
to
suffer
all
sorts
of
extremity
,
rather
than
subject
myself
to
the
tyranny
of
his
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
This
year
was
productive
of
one
fatal
event
,
which
I
felt
with
the
utmost
sensibility
of
sorrow
,
and
shall
always
remember
with
regret
:
<EOS>
I
mean
the
death
of
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
with
whom
I
had
constantly
maintained
an
intimate
correspondence
since
the
first
commencement
of
our
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
He
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
men
,
and
promised
to
be
one
of
the
brightest
ornaments
that
this
or
any
other
age
had
produced
.
<EOS>
I
enjoyed
his
friendship
,
without
reserve
;
and
such
was
the
confidence
he
reposed
in
my
integrity
,
from
long
experience
of
my
truth
,
that
he
often
said
he
would
believe
my
bare
assertion
,
even
tho
<EOS>
'
it
should
contradict
the
evidence
of
his
own
senses
.
<EOS>
These
being
the
terms
upon
which
we
lived
,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
I
bore
the
loss
of
him
without
repining
:
indeed
my
grief
was
unspeakable
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
the
edge
of
it
be
now
smoothed
by
the
lenient
hand
of
time
,
I
shall
never
cease
to
cherish
his
memory
with
the
most
tender
remembrance
.
    
<EOS>
During
the
last
period
of
my
living
with
my
lord
,
I
had
agreed
to
the
expediency
of
obtaining
an
act
of
parliament
,
which
would
enable
him
to
pay
his
debts
;
on
which
occasion
there
was
a
necessity
for
cancelling
a
deed
that
subsisted
between
us
,
relating
to
a
separate
maintenance
;
to
which
,
on
certain
provisos
,
I
was
intitled
:
and
this
was
to
be
set
aside
,
so
far
as
it
interfered
with
the
above
mentioned
scheme
,
while
the
rest
of
it
should
remain
in
force
.
    
<EOS>
When
this
affair
was
about
to
be
transacted
,
my
lord
very
generously
insisted
upon
my
concurrence
,
in
annulling
the
whole
settlement
;
and
when
I
refused
to
comply
with
this
demand
,
because
this
was
the
sole
resource
I
had
against
his
ill
usage
,
he
would
not
proceed
in
the
execution
of
his
plan
,
tho
'
by
dropping
it
<EOS>
he
hurt
no
-
body
but
himself
;
and
accused
me
of
having
receded
from
my
word
,
after
I
had
drawn
him
into
a
considerable
expence
.
    
<EOS>
This
imputation
of
breaking
my
word
,
which
I
defy
the
whole
world
to
prove
I
ever
did
,
incensed
me
the
more
,
as
I
myself
had
proposed
the
scheme
for
his
service
,
altho
'
<EOS>
I
knew
the
accomplishment
of
it
would
endanger
the
validity
of
my
own
settlement
;
and
my
indignation
was
still
more
augmented
by
the
behaviour
of
Mr
G
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
always
professed
a
regard
for
my
interest
,
and
upon
my
last
accommodation
with
my
lord
,
undertaken
to
effect
a
reconciliation
between
my
father
and
me
:
but
when
he
was
questioned
about
the
particulars
of
this
difference
,
and
desired
to
declare
whether
his
lordship
or
I
was
to
blame
,
he
declined
the
office
of
arbitrator
,
refused
to
be
explicit
on
the
subject
,
and
by
certain
shrewd
hums
and
ha
's
signified
his
disapprobation
of
my
conduct
;
and
yet
this
very
man
,
when
I
imparted
to
him
,
in
confidence
,
my
intention
of
making
another
retreat
,
and
frankly
asked
his
opinion
of
my
design
,
seemed
to
acquiesce
in
the
justice
of
it
,
in
these
remarkable
words
:
"
Madam
,
if
I
thought
,
or
had
hopes
of
my
lord
's
growing
better
,
I
would
down
on
my
knees
,
to
desire
you
to
stay
;
but
as
I
have
not
,
I
say
nothing
.
"
    
<EOS>
If
he
connived
at
my
conduct
in
this
particular
,
why
should
he
disapprove
of
it
,
when
all
I
asked
was
but
common
justice
?
<EOS>
But
he
was
a
dependent
;
and
therefore
I
excuse
his
phlegmatic
(
not
to
call
it
unfriendly
)
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
he
could
not
be
too
cautious
of
giving
offence
to
his
lordship
,
who
sometimes
made
him
feel
the
effects
of
that
wrath
which
other
people
had
kindled
;
particularly
,
in
consequence
of
a
small
adventure
which
happened
about
this
very
period
of
time
.
    
<EOS>
A
very
agreeable
,
sprightly
,
good
-
natured
young
man
,
a
near
relation
of
my
lord
,
happening
to
be
at
our
house
one
evening
,
when
there
was
a
fire
in
the
neighbourhood
,
we
agreed
to
go
and
sup
at
a
tavern
,
en
famille
;
and
having
spent
the
evening
with
great
mirth
and
good
humour
,
this
young
gentleman
,
who
was
naturally
facetious
,
in
taking
his
leave
,
saluted
us
all
round
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
who
had
before
entertained
some
jealousy
of
his
kinsman
,
was
very
much
provoked
by
this
trifling
incident
,
but
very
prudently
suppressed
his
displeasure
till
he
returned
to
his
own
house
,
where
his
rage
co
-
operating
with
the
Champagne
he
had
drank
,
inflamed
him
to
such
a
degree
of
resolution
,
that
he
sprung
upon
the
innocent
G####n
,
and
collared
him
with
great
fury
,
though
he
was
altogether
unconcerned
in
the
cause
of
his
indignation
.
    
<EOS>
This
extravagant
and
frantic
behaviour
,
added
to
the
other
grievances
under
which
I
laboured
,
hastened
my
resolution
of
leaving
him
;
and
he
to
this
day
blames
his
relation
,
as
the
immediate
cause
of
my
escape
,
whereas
he
ought
to
place
it
to
the
account
of
his
own
madness
and
indiscretion
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
retired
to
Park
-
street
,
he
cautioned
all
my
tradesmen
(
not
even
excepting
my
baker
)
against
giving
me
credit
,
assuring
them
that
he
would
not
pay
any
debts
I
should
contract
;
and
the
difficulties
to
which
I
was
reduced
,
in
consequence
of
this
charitable
declaration
,
together
with
the
reflection
of
what
I
had
suffered
,
and
might
undergo
,
from
the
caprice
and
barbarity
of
his
disposition
,
affected
my
health
so
much
,
that
I
was
taken
again
ill
,
and
my
life
thought
in
danger
.
    
<EOS>
My
constitution
,
however
,
got
the
better
of
my
distemper
,
and
I
was
ordered
into
the
country
by
my
physicians
,
for
the
benefit
of
the
air
;
<EOS>
so
that
I
found
myself
under
the
necessity
of
keeping
two
houses
,
when
I
was
little
able
to
support
one
,
and
set
up
my
chariot
,
because
I
could
not
defray
the
expence
of
an
hackney
coach
;
for
I
had
as
much
credit
given
me
as
I
ask'd
for
,
<EOS>
notwithstanding
my
lord
's
orders
to
the
contrary
.
    
<EOS>
Having
recruited
my
spirits
in
the
country
,
I
returned
to
town
,
and
was
visited
by
my
friends
,
who
never
forsook
me
in
adversity
,
and
in
the
summer
removed
to
an
house
in
Essex
,
where
I
lived
a
few
months
in
great
tranquillity
,
unmolested
by
my
tyrant
,
who
sometimes
gave
me
a
whole
year
's
respite
.
<EOS>
Here
I
used
to
ride
and
drive
by
turns
(
as
my
humour
dictated
)
with
horses
which
were
lent
me
;
and
I
had
the
company
of
my
lover
,
and
another
gentleman
,
who
was
a
very
agreeable
companion
,
and
of
singular
service
to
me
in
the
sequel
.
    
<EOS>
At
last
,
my
lord
having
received
intelligence
of
the
place
of
my
abode
,
and
<EOS>
his
tormenting
humour
recurring
<EOS>
,
he
set
out
for
my
habitation
,
and
in
the
morning
appeared
in
his
coach
and
fix
,
attended
by
Mr
G####n
,
and
another
person
,
whom
he
had
engaged
for
the
purpose
,
with
several
domesticks
armed
.
<EOS>
I
immediately
shut
up
my
doors
at
his
approach
,
and
refused
him
admittance
,
which
he
endeavoured
to
obtain
by
a
succession
of
prayers
and
threats
;
but
I
was
deaf
to
both
,
and
resolved
to
hold
out
to
the
last
.
    
<EOS>
Seeing
me
determined
,
he
began
his
attack
,
and
his
servants
actually
forced
their
way
into
the
house
;
upon
which
I
retreated
up
stairs
,
and
fortified
myself
in
an
apartment
,
which
the
assailants
stormed
with
such
fury
,
that
the
door
began
to
give
way
,
and
I
retired
into
another
room
.
    
<EOS>
Whilst
<EOS>
I
remained
in
this
post
,
Mr
G####n
demanded
a
parley
,
in
which
he
begg'd
<EOS>
I
would
favour
my
lord
with
an
interview
,
otherwise
he
knew
not
what
would
be
the
consequence
.
<EOS>
To
this
remonstrance
I
replied
,
that
I
was
not
disposed
to
comply
with
his
request
;
and
that
though
their
design
should
be
murder
,
I
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
death
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
declaration
they
renewed
their
attacks
,
which
they
carried
on
with
indifferent
success
till
the
afternoon
,
when
my
lord
(
as
if
he
had
been
at
play
)
sent
a
formal
message
to
me
,
desiring
that
all
hostilities
should
cease
,
till
after
both
parties
should
have
dined
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
my
own
servants
came
for
instructions
;
and
I
ordered
them
to
let
him
have
every
thing
which
he
should
call
for
,
as
far
as
the
house
would
afford
.
    
<EOS>
He
did
not
fail
to
make
use
of
this
permission
;
but
,
sitting
down
with
his
companions
,
ate
up
my
dinner
without
hesitation
,
after
he
had
paid
me
the
compliment
,
of
desiring
to
know
what
he
should
send
up
to
my
apartment
.
<EOS>
Far
from
having
any
stomach
to
partake
of
his
meal
,
I
sat
solitary
upon
my
bed
,
in
a
state
of
melancholy
expectation
,
having
fastened
the
door
of
the
outward
room
for
my
security
,
while
I
kept
my
chamber
open
for
the
convenience
of
air
,
the
weather
being
excessively
hot
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
having
indulged
his
appetite
,
resumed
his
attempt
,
and
all
of
a
sudden
I
heard
a
noise
in
the
next
room
;
upon
which
I
started
up
,
and
perceiving
that
he
had
got
into
my
anti
-
chamber
,
by
the
help
of
a
bench
that
stood
under
the
window
<EOS>
,
I
flung
to
the
door
of
my
room
,
which
I
locked
with
great
expedition
,
and
opening
another
that
communicated
with
the
staircase
,
ran
out
of
the
house
,
through
a
croud
of
more
than
an
hundred
people
,
whom
this
fray
had
gathered
together
.
    
<EOS>
Being
universally
beloved
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
respected
by
my
lord
's
servants
,
I
passed
among
them
untouched
,
and
took
refuge
in
a
neighbouring
cottage
;
while
his
lordship
bawled
and
roared
for
assistance
,
being
afraid
to
come
out
as
he
had
got
in
.
<EOS>
Without
waiting
for
his
deliberations
,
I
changed
cloaths
with
the
poor
woman
who
had
given
me
shelter
,
and
in
her
blue
apron
and
straw
-
hat
sallied
out
into
the
fields
,
intending
to
seek
protection
at
the
house
of
a
gentleman
not
far
off
,
though
I
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
road
that
led
to
it
.
<EOS>
However
,
it
was
my
good
fortune
to
meet
with
a
farmer
,
who
undertook
to
conduct
me
to
the
place
;
otherwise
I
should
have
missed
my
way
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
lain
in
the
fields
;
for
,
by
this
time
,
it
was
eight
o'clock
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
Under
the
direction
of
this
guide
,
I
traversed
hedges
and
ditches
,
(
for
I
would
not
venture
to
travel
in
the
highway
,
lest
I
should
fall
into
the
hands
of
my
pursuer
)
and
after
I
had
actually
tumbled
in
the
mire
,
and
walked
six
or
seven
long
miles
,
by
the
help
of
a
good
spirit
,
which
never
failed
me
on
such
occasions
<EOS>
,
I
arrived
at
the
place
,
and
rung
the
bell
at
the
garden
-
gate
for
admittance
.
    
<EOS>
Seeing
my
figure
,
which
was
very
uncouth
,
together
with
my
draggled
condition
,
they
denied
me
entrance
;
but
when
they
understood
who
I
was
,
immediately
opened
the
door
,
and
I
was
hospitably
entertained
,
after
having
been
the
subject
of
mirth
,
on
account
of
my
dress
and
adventure
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
I
returned
,
and
took
possession
of
my
house
again
,
where
I
resumed
my
former
amusements
,
which
I
enjoyed
in
quiet
,
for
the
space
of
a
whole
month
,
waiting
with
resignation
for
the
issue
of
my
law
-
suit
;
when
one
afternoon
,
I
was
apprized
of
his
lordship
's
approach
,
by
one
of
my
spies
,
whom
I
always
employed
to
reconnoitre
the
road
;
and
so
fortunate
was
I
in
the
choice
of
these
scouts
,
that
I
never
was
betrayed
by
one
of
them
,
though
they
were
often
bribed
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
I
no
sooner
received
this
intelligence
,
than
I
ordered
my
horse
to
be
saddled
,
and
mounting
,
rode
out
of
sight
immediately
,
directing
my
course
a
different
way
from
the
London
road
.
<EOS>
I
had
not
long
proceeded
in
this
tract
,
when
my
career
was
all
of
a
sudden
stopp'd
<EOS>
by
a
five
-
bar
gate
,
which
,
after
some
hesitation
,
I
resolved
to
leap
(
my
horse
being
an
old
hunter
)
if
I
should
find
myself
pursued
.
<EOS>
However
,
with
much
difficulty
I
made
shift
to
open
it
,
and
arrived
in
safety
at
the
house
of
my
very
good
friend
Mr
G
#
#
#
#
,
who
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
had
promised
me
his
protection
,
if
it
should
be
wanted
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
secured
for
the
present
,
I
sent
out
spies
to
bring
information
of
his
lordship
's
proceedings
,
and
understood
that
he
had
taken
possession
of
my
house
,
turned
my
servants
adrift
,
and
made
himself
master
of
all
my
moveables
,
cloaths
and
papers
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
the
papers
,
they
were
of
no
consequence
,
but
of
cloaths
I
had
a
good
stock
;
and
when
I
had
reason
to
believe
that
he
did
not
intend
to
relinquish
his
conquest
,
I
thought
it
was
high
time
for
me
to
remove
to
a
greater
distance
from
his
quarters
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
two
days
after
my
escape
,
I
set
out
at
eleven
o'clock
at
night
,
in
a
chariot
and
four
,
which
I
borrowed
of
my
friend
,
attended
by
a
footman
,
who
was
a
stout
fellow
and
well
armed
,
I
myself
being
provided
with
a
brace
of
good
pistols
,
which
I
was
fully
determined
to
use
,
against
any
person
who
should
presume
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
me
,
except
my
lord
,
for
whom
a
less
mortal
weapon
would
have
sufficed
,
such
as
a
bodkin
or
a
tinder
-
box
.
<EOS>
Nothing
could
be
farther
from
my
intention
,
than
the
desire
of
hurting
any
living
creature
,
much
less
<EOS>
my
husband
<EOS>
;
my
design
was
only
to
defend
myself
from
cruelty
and
oppression
,
which
I
knew
,
by
fatal
experience
,
would
infallibly
be
my
lot
,
should
he
get
me
into
his
power
:
and
I
thought
I
had
as
good
a
right
to
preserve
my
happiness
,
as
that
which
every
individual
has
to
preserve
his
life
,
especially
against
a
set
of
ruffians
,
who
were
engaged
to
rob
me
of
it
,
for
a
little
dirty
lucre
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
our
journey
,
the
footman
came
up
,
and
told
me
I
was
dogg'd
;
upon
which
I
looked
out
,
and
seeing
a
man
riding
by
the
chariot
-
side
,
presented
one
of
my
pistols
out
at
the
window
,
and
preserved
that
posture
of
defence
,
until
he
thought
proper
to
retreat
,
and
rid
me
of
the
fears
that
attended
his
company
.
<EOS>
I
arrived
in
town
,
and
changing
my
equipage
,
hired
an
open
chaise
,
in
which
(
though
I
was
almost
starved
with
cold
)
<EOS>
I
travelled
to
Reading
,
which
I
reached
by
ten
next
morning
;
and
from
thence
proceeded
farther
in
the
country
,
with
a
view
of
taking
refuge
with
Mrs
C
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
my
particular
friend
.
    
<EOS>
Here
I
should
have
found
shelter
,
though
my
lord
had
been
beforehand
with
me
,
and
endeavoured
to
prepossess
her
against
my
conduct
,
had
not
the
house
been
crouded
with
company
,
among
whom
I
could
not
possibly
have
been
concealed
,
especially
from
her
brother
,
who
was
an
intimate
friend
of
my
persecutor
.
    
<EOS>
Things
being
thus
situated
,
I
enjoyed
but
a
very
short
interview
with
her
,
in
which
her
sorrow
and
perplexity
on
my
account
appeared
with
great
expression
in
her
countenance
;
and
though
it
was
not
in
her
power
to
afford
me
the
relief
I
expected
,
she
,
in
the
most
genteel
manner
,
sent
after
me
a
small
sum
of
money
,
thinking
that
,
considering
the
hurry
in
which
I
left
my
house
,
I
might
have
occasion
for
it
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
was
by
this
time
benumbed
with
cold
,
fatigued
with
travelling
,
and
almost
fretted
to
death
by
my
disappointment
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
was
no
time
to
indulge
despondence
;
since
no
body
could
,
or
would
,
assist
me
,
I
stood
the
more
in
need
of
my
own
resolution
and
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
After
some
deliberation
,
I
steered
my
course
back
to
London
;
and
being
unwilling
to
return
by
the
same
road
in
which
I
came
,
as
well
as
impatient
to
be
at
the
end
of
my
journey
,
I
chose
the
Bagshot
way
,
and
ventured
to
cross
the
heath
by
moon
-
light
.
    
<EOS>
Here
I
was
attacked
by
a
foot
-
pad
armed
with
a
broad
-
sword
,
who
came
up
,
and
demanded
my
money
.
<EOS>
My
stock
amounted
to
twelve
guineas
;
and
I
foresaw
,
that
should
I
be
stripp'd
of
the
whole
sum
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
travel
without
discovering
who
I
was
,
and
,
consequently
,
running
the
risk
of
being
detected
by
my
pursuer
.
    
<EOS>
On
these
considerations
,
I
gave
the
fellow
three
guineas
and
some
silver
;
with
which
he
was
so
far
from
being
satisfied
,
that
he
threatened
to
search
me
for
more
:
<EOS>
but
I
ordered
the
coachman
to
proceed
,
and
by
good
fortune
escaped
that
ceremony
;
though
I
was
under
some
apprehension
of
being
overtaken
with
a
pistol
-
bullet
in
my
flight
,
and
therefore
held
down
my
head
in
the
chaise
,
in
imitation
of
some
great
men
,
who
are
said
to
have
ducked
in
the
same
manner
,
in
the
day
of
battle
.
    
<EOS>
My
fears
happened
to
be
disappointed
:
I
lay
at
an
inn
upon
the
road
,
and
next
day
arrived
in
town
,
in
the
utmost
difficulty
and
distress
;
for
I
knew
not
where
to
fix
my
habitation
,
and
was
destitute
of
all
means
of
support
.
<EOS>
In
this
dilemma
,
I
applied
to
my
lawyer
,
who
recommended
me
to
the
house
of
a
tradesman
in
Westminster
,
where
I
lodged
and
boarded
,
upon
credit
,
with
my
faithful
Abigail
,
(
whom
I
shall
distinguish
by
the
name
of
Mrs
S####r
)
for
the
space
of
ten
weeks
,
during
which
I
saw
nobody
,
and
never
once
stirred
abroad
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
was
thus
harrassed
out
of
all
enjoyment
of
life
,
and
reduced
to
the
utmost
indigence
,
by
the
cruelty
of
my
persecutor
,
who
had
even
stripp'd
<EOS>
me
of
my
wearing
apparel
<EOS>
,
I
made
a
conquest
of
lord
D
#
#
#
#
,
a
nobleman
who
is
now
dead
,
and
therefore
I
shall
say
little
of
his
character
,
which
is
perfectly
well
known
:
<EOS>
this
only
will
I
observe
,
that
,
next
to
my
own
tyrant
,
he
was
the
only
person
of
whom
I
had
the
greatest
abhorrence
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
when
these
two
came
in
competition
,
I
preferred
the
offers
of
this
new
lover
,
which
were
very
considerable
;
and
as
an
asylum
was
the
chief
thing
I
wanted
,
agreed
to
follow
him
to
his
country
-
seat
,
whither
<EOS>
I
actually
sent
my
cloaths
,
which
I
had
purchased
upon
credit
.
    
<EOS>
However
,
upon
mature
deliberation
,
I
changed
my
mind
,
and
signified
my
resolution
in
a
letter
,
desiring
at
the
same
time
,
that
my
baggage
might
be
sent
back
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
message
,
I
expected
a
visit
from
him
,
in
all
the
rage
of
indignation
and
disappointment
,
and
gave
orders
,
that
he
should
not
be
admitted
into
my
house
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
this
precaution
,
he
found
means
to
procure
entrance
;
and
one
of
the
first
objects
that
I
saw
,
next
morning
,
in
my
bed
-
chamber
,
was
my
lover
,
armed
with
his
horse
-
whip
,
against
which
(
from
the
knowledge
of
the
man
)
<EOS>
I
did
not
think
myself
altogether
secure
;
though
I
was
not
much
alarmed
,
because
I
believed
myself
superior
to
him
in
point
of
bravery
,
should
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
:
<EOS>
but
,
contrary
to
my
expectation
,
and
his
usual
behaviour
to
our
sex
,
he
accosted
me
very
politely
,
and
began
to
expostulate
upon
the
contents
of
my
letter
.
<EOS>
I
freely
told
him
,
that
I
had
rashly
assented
to
his
proposal
,
for
my
own
convenience
only
;
that
when
I
reflected
on
what
I
had
done
,
I
thought
it
ungenerous
in
me
to
live
with
him
upon
these
terms
;
and
that
,
as
I
did
not
like
him
,
and
could
not
dissemble
,
such
a
correspondence
could
never
tend
to
the
satisfaction
of
either
.
<EOS>
He
allowed
the
inference
was
just
,
though
he
was
very
much
chagrined
at
my
previous
proceeding
:
he
relinquished
his
claim
,
restored
my
cloaths
,
and
never
afterwards
upbraided
me
with
my
conduct
in
this
affair
;
though
he
at
one
time
owned
,
that
he
still
loved
me
,
and
ever
should
,
because
I
had
used
him
ill
;
a
declaration
that
strongly
marks
the
peculiarity
of
his
character
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
part
,
I
own
that
my
behaviour
on
this
occasion
,
is
no
other
way
excusable
,
than
on
account
of
the
miserable
perplexity
of
my
circumstances
,
which
were
often
so
calamitous
,
that
I
wonder
I
have
not
been
compelled
to
take
such
steps
,
as
would
have
rendered
my
conduct
much
more
exceptionable
than
it
really
is
.
    
<EOS>
At
last
,
all
my
hopes
were
blasted
by
the
issue
of
my
suit
,
which
was
determined
in
favour
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Even
then
I
refused
to
yield
;
on
the
contrary
,
coming
out
of
retirement
,
I
took
lodgings
in
Suffolk
-
street
,
and
set
my
tyrant
at
defiance
.
<EOS>
But
,
being
unwilling
to
trust
my
doors
to
the
care
of
other
people
,
I
took
an
house
in
Conduit
-
street
;
and
no
sooner
appeared
in
the
world
again
,
than
I
was
surrounded
by
divers
and
sundry
sorts
of
admirers
.
<EOS>
I
believe
I
received
the
incense
and
addresses
of
all
kinds
under
the
sun
,
except
that
sort
which
was
most
to
my
liking
,
a
man
capable
of
contracting
and
inspiring
a
mutual
attachment
;
but
such
a
one
is
equally
rare
and
inestimable
:
not
but
that
I
own
myself
greatly
obliged
to
all
those
who
cultivated
my
good
graces
,
though
they
were
very
little
beholden
to
me
;
for
,
where
I
did
not
really
love
,
I
could
never
profess
that
passion
:
that
sort
of
dissimulation
is
a
slavery
that
no
honest
nature
will
undergo
.
<EOS>
Except
one
worthy
young
man
whom
I
sometimes
saw
,
they
were
a
strange
medley
of
insignificant
beings
;
one
was
insipid
,
another
ridiculously
affected
,
a
third
void
of
all
education
,
a
fourth
altogether
inconsistent
;
and
in
short
,
I
found
as
many
trifling
characters
among
the
men
,
as
ever
I
observed
in
my
own
sex
.
    
<EOS>
Some
of
them
<EOS>
I
endeavoured
to
bring
over
to
my
maxims
,
while
they
attempted
to
make
a
proselyte
of
me
;
but
finding
the
task
impracticable
on
both
sides
,
we
very
wisely
dropt
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
I
was
blessed
with
the
acquaintance
of
one
nobleman
,
who
is
,
perhaps
,
the
first
character
in
England
,
in
point
of
honour
,
integrity
,
with
,
sense
and
benevolence
:
when
I
have
thus
distinguished
him
,
I
need
scarce
mention
<EOS>
lord
  
.
<EOS>
This
great
,
this
good
man
,
possesses
every
accomplishment
requisite
to
inspire
admiration
,
love
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
With
infinitely
more
merit
than
almost
ever
fell
to
one
man
's
share
,
he
manifests
such
diffidence
of
his
own
qualifications
,
as
can
not
fail
to
prepossess
every
company
in
his
favour
.
<EOS>
He
seems
to
observe
nothing
,
yet
sees
every
thing
;
his
manner
of
telling
a
story
,
and
making
trifles
elegant
,
is
peculiar
to
himself
;
and
though
he
has
a
thousand
oddities
,
they
serve
only
to
make
him
more
agreeable
.
<EOS>
After
what
I
have
said
,
it
may
be
supposed
that
I
was
enamoured
of
his
person
:
but
this
was
not
the
case
;
love
is
altogether
capricious
and
fanciful
;
yet
I
admire
,
honour
,
and
esteem
him
to
the
highest
degree
;
and
when
I
observe
,
that
his
character
resembled
that
of
my
dear
departed
friend
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
;
or
rather
,
that
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
,
had
he
lived
,
would
have
resembled
lord
  
,
I
pay
the
highest
compliment
I
can
conceive
both
to
the
living
and
the
dead
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
nobleman
's
friendship
and
conversation
I
thought
myself
happy
;
though
I
was
,
as
usual
,
exposed
to
the
indefatigable
efforts
of
my
lord
,
who
,
one
day
,
while
I
was
favoured
with
the
company
of
this
generous
friend
,
appeared
at
my
door
in
his
coach
,
attended
by
another
gentleman
,
who
demanded
entrance
,
with
an
air
of
authority
.
    
<EOS>
A
very
honest
footman
,
who
had
been
long
in
my
service
,
ran
up
stairs
in
the
utmost
consternation
,
and
gave
me
an
account
of
what
had
happened
below
.
<EOS>
Upon
which
,
I
told
him
he
had
nothing
to
answer
for
,
and
ordered
him
to
keep
the
door
fast
shut
against
all
opposition
:
though
I
was
so
much
affected
with
this
unexpected
assault
,
that
lord
   
said
,
he
was
never
more
surprized
and
shocked
in
his
life
,
than
at
the
horror
which
appeared
in
my
countenance
,
when
I
saw
the
coach
stop
at
my
door
.
    
<EOS>
My
little
hero
being
refused
admittance
,
went
away
,
threatening
to
return
speedily
with
a
reinforcement
;
and
during
this
interval
,
I
provided
myself
with
a
soldier
,
whom
I
placed
centinel
at
the
door
withinside
,
to
guard
me
from
the
danger
of
such
assaults
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
My
lord
,
true
to
his
promise
,
marched
back
with
his
auxiliaries
,
reinforced
with
a
constable
,
and
repeated
his
demand
of
being
admitted
;
and
my
soldier
opening
the
sash
,
in
order
to
answer
him
according
to
my
directions
,
he
no
sooner
perceived
the
red
coat
,
than
he
was
seized
with
such
a
pannic
,
that
he
instantly
fled
with
great
precipitation
;
and
when
he
recounted
the
adventure
,
like
Falstaff
in
the
play
,
multiplied
my
guard
into
a
whole
file
of
musqueteers
.
<EOS>
He
also
made
shift
to
discover
the
gentleman
,
who
had
been
so
kind
as
to
lend
me
one
of
his
company
,
and
complained
of
him
to
the
duke
of
N
#
#
#
#
,
in
hopes
of
seeing
him
broke
for
this
misdemeanour
;
but
in
that
expectation
he
was
luckily
disappointed
.
    
<EOS>
Perceiving
that
in
England
I
should
never
enjoy
peace
,
but
be
continually
subject
to
those
alarms
and
disquiets
which
had
already
impaired
my
health
and
spirits
,
I
resolved
to
repair
again
to
France
,
my
best
refuge
and
sure
retreat
from
the
persecution
of
my
tyrant
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
before
I
took
this
step
,
I
endeavoured
,
by
the
advice
of
my
friends
,
to
conceal
myself
near
Windsor
;
but
was
in
a
little
time
discovered
by
my
lord
,
and
hunted
out
of
my
lurking
place
,
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
then
removed
to
Chelsea
,
where
I
suffered
inconceivable
uneasiness
and
agitation
of
mind
,
from
the
nature
of
my
situation
,
my
tranquillity
being
thus
incessantly
invaded
by
a
man
who
could
not
be
satisfied
with
me
,
and
yet
could
not
live
without
me
:
so
that
,
though
I
was
very
much
indisposed
,
I
set
out
for
France
,
by
the
way
of
the
Hague
,
as
the
war
had
shut
up
all
other
communication
,
having
no
other
attendant
but
my
woman
S####r
,
who
,
though
she
dreaded
the
sea
,
and
was
upon
the
brink
of
matrimony
,
would
not
quit
me
in
such
a
calamitous
condition
,
until
I
was
joined
by
my
footman
and
other
maid
,
whom
I
ordered
to
follow
me
with
the
baggage
.
<EOS>
But
,
before
my
departure
,
I
sent
a
message
to
lord
  
,
demanding
my
cloaths
,
which
he
had
seized
in
Essex
;
and
he
refusing
to
deliver
them
,
I
was
obliged
to
equip
myself
anew
,
upon
credit
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
supplied
with
money
for
my
journey
by
my
good
friend
L
#
#
#
#
;
and
after
a
short
and
pleasant
passage
,
arrived
at
the
Hague
,
where
I
stayed
two
months
,
and
parted
with
S####r
,
on
whom
I
settled
an
annuity
of
five
and
twenty
pounds
,
payable
out
of
the
provision
which
I
had
or
might
obtain
from
my
husband
.
<EOS>
The
same
allowance
had
I
prevailed
upon
lord
B
#
#
#
#
to
grant
to
another
maid
,
who
attended
me
while
I
lived
in
his
house
.
    
<EOS>
I
did
not
much
relish
the
people
in
Holland
,
because
they
seemed
entirely
devoted
to
self
-
interest
,
without
any
taste
for
pleasure
or
politeness
;
a
species
of
disposition
that
could
not
be
very
agreeable
to
me
,
who
always
despised
money
,
had
an
unbounded
benevolence
of
heart
,
and
loved
pleasure
beyond
every
other
consideration
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
pleasure
,
I
would
not
be
understood
to
mean
sensuality
,
which
constitutes
the
supreme
happiness
of
those
only
,
who
are
void
of
sentiment
and
imagination
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
received
some
civilities
in
this
place
;
and
among
the
rest
,
the
reputation
of
having
for
my
lover
the
king
of
P
#
#
#
#
's
minister
,
who
was
young
and
airy
,
and
visited
me
often
;
circumstances
that
were
sufficient
to
lay
me
under
the
imputation
of
an
amour
,
which
I
frequently
incurred
,
without
having
given
the
least
cause
of
suspicion
.
    
<EOS>
Having
taken
leave
of
my
Dutch
friends
,
I
departed
from
the
Hague
,
in
company
with
an
Englishwoman
,
whom
I
had
chose
for
that
purpose
,
and
arrived
at
Antwerp
,
with
much
difficulty
and
danger
,
the
highway
being
infested
with
robbers
.
<EOS>
After
having
reposed
myself
a
few
days
in
this
city
,
I
hired
a
coach
for
myself
,
and
set
out
,
with
my
companion
,
for
Brussels
;
but
,
before
we
reached
Mechlin
,
our
vehicle
was
attacked
by
two
hussars
,
who
,
with
their
sabres
drawn
,
obliged
the
coachman
to
drive
into
a
wood
near
the
road
.
<EOS>
I
at
first
imagined
they
wanted
to
examine
our
passports
,
but
was
soon
too
well
convinced
of
their
design
;
and
though
very
much
shocked
at
the
discovery
,
found
resolution
enough
to
suppress
my
concern
,
so
that
it
should
not
aggravate
the
terrors
of
the
young
woman
,
who
had
almost
died
with
apprehension
.
    
<EOS>
I
even
encouraged
her
to
hope
for
the
best
;
and
addressing
myself
to
the
robbers
in
French
,
begg'd
in
the
most
suppliant
manner
,
that
they
would
spare
our
lives
;
upon
which
,
one
of
them
,
who
was
a
little
fellow
,
assured
me
in
the
same
language
,
that
we
had
nothing
to
fear
for
our
persons
.
    
<EOS>
When
we
were
conveyed
in
a
state
of
dreadful
suspence
about
three
quarters
of
a
mile
into
the
wood
,
the
ruffians
came
into
the
coach
,
and
taking
my
keys
,
which
I
kept
ready
in
my
hand
for
them
,
opened
three
large
trunks
,
that
contained
my
baggage
,
and
emptying
them
of
every
thing
but
my
hoops
and
a
few
books
,
packed
up
their
booty
in
a
cloth
;
then
robbing
me
of
my
money
and
jewels
,
even
to
my
shoe
-
buckles
and
sleeve
-
buttons
,
took
my
footman
's
laced
hat
,
and
gave
it
,
by
way
of
gratification
,
to
a
peasant
,
who
came
from
behind
the
bushes
,
and
assisted
them
in
packing
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
dispatched
,
they
ordered
us
to
return
to
the
road
,
by
a
different
way
from
that
in
which
we
were
carried
into
the
wood
;
and
mounting
their
horses
,
rode
off
with
the
plunder
,
though
not
before
the
little
fellow
,
who
was
the
least
ferocious
of
the
two
,
had
come
and
shaken
me
by
the
hand
,
wishing
us
a
good
journey
;
a
compliment
which
I
heartily
returned
,
being
extremely
well
pleased
at
the
retreat
of
two
such
companions
,
who
had
detained
us
a
whole
half
hour
;
during
which
,
notwithstanding
the
assurance
I
had
received
,
I
was
in
continual
apprehension
of
seeing
their
operation
conclude
with
the
murder
of
us
all
;
for
I
supposed
they
were
of
that
gang
,
who
had
some
time
before
murthered
a
French
officer
,
and
used
a
lady
extremely
ill
,
after
having
rifled
her
of
all
she
had
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
undergone
pillage
,
and
being
reduced
to
the
extremity
of
indigence
in
a
foreign
land
,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
my
reflections
were
very
comfortable
;
and
yet
,
though
I
sustained
the
whole
damage
,
I
was
the
only
person
in
the
company
who
bore
the
accident
with
any
resolution
and
presence
of
mind
.
<EOS>
My
coachman
and
valet
seemed
quite
petrified
with
fear
;
and
it
was
not
,
till
I
had
repeated
my
directions
,
that
the
former
drove
farther
into
the
wood
,
and
took
the
first
turning
to
the
right
,
in
order
to
regain
the
road
,
according
to
the
command
of
the
robbers
,
which
I
did
not
choose
to
disobey
.
    
<EOS>
This
misfortune
I
suffered
by
the
misinformation
I
received
at
Antwerp
,
where
I
would
have
provided
myself
with
an
escort
,
had
I
not
been
assured
,
that
there
was
not
the
least
occasion
to
put
myself
to
such
extraordinary
expence
:
and
indeed
,
the
robbers
took
the
only
half
hour
in
which
they
could
have
had
an
opportunity
of
plundering
us
;
for
we
no
sooner
returned
into
the
Highway
,
than
we
met
with
the
French
artillery
coming
from
Brussels
,
which
was
a
security
to
us
,
during
the
rest
of
our
journey
.
<EOS>
We
were
afterwards
informed
at
a
small
village
,
that
there
was
actually
a
large
gang
of
deserters
,
who
harboured
in
that
wood
,
from
which
they
made
excursions
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
kept
the
peasants
in
continual
alarms
.
    
<EOS>
Having
proceeded
a
little
way
,
we
were
stopp'd
by
the
artillery
crossing
a
bridge
;
and
as
the
train
was
very
long
,
must
have
been
detained
till
night
,
had
not
a
soldier
informed
me
,
that
if
I
would
take
the
trouble
to
come
out
of
my
coach
,
and
apply
to
the
commandant
,
he
would
order
them
to
halt
,
and
allow
me
to
pass
.
    
<EOS>
I
took
the
man
's
advice
,
and
was
by
him
conducted
,
with
much
difficulty
,
through
the
croud
to
some
officers
,
who
seemed
scarce
to
deserve
the
name
;
for
,
when
I
signified
my
request
,
they
neither
rose
up
,
nor
desired
me
to
sit
down
;
but
lolling
in
their
chairs
,
with
one
leg
stretched
out
,
asked
,
with
an
air
of
disrespectful
raillery
,
where
I
was
going
;
and
when
I
answered
,
"
To
Paris
;
"
desired
to
know
what
I
would
do
there
.
    
<EOS>
I
,
who
am
naturally
civil
where
I
am
civilly
used
,
and
saucy
enough
where
I
think
myself
treated
with
disregard
,
was
very
much
piqued
at
their
insolent
and
unmannerly
behaviour
,
and
began
to
reply
to
their
impertinent
questions
,
very
abruptly
;
so
that
a
very
tart
dialogue
would
have
ensued
,
had
not
the
conversation
been
interrupted
by
a
tall
,
thin
,
genteel
young
French
nobleman
,
an
officer
in
the
army
,
who
chancing
to
come
in
,
asked
with
great
politeness
,
what
I
would
please
to
have
.
<EOS>
I
then
repeated
my
desire
,
and
produced
my
passports
,
<EOS>
by
which
he
learn'd
who
I
was
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
gave
orders
,
that
my
coach
should
pass
;
and
afterwards
visited
me
at
Paris
,
having
obtained
my
permission
,
and
taken
my
address
at
parting
;
while
the
others
,
understanding
my
name
and
quality
,
asked
pardon
for
their
impolite
carriage
,
which
they
told
me
was
owing
to
the
representation
of
the
soldier
,
who
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
I
was
a
strolling
actress
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
at
this
mistake
,
which
might
have
proceeded
from
the
circumstances
of
my
appearance
,
my
footman
having
been
obliged
to
change
hats
with
the
peasant
,
and
myself
being
without
buckles
in
my
shoes
,
and
buttons
in
my
riding
-
shirt
,
while
my
countenance
still
retained
marks
of
the
fear
and
confusion
I
had
undergone
.
    
<EOS>
After
all
,
perhaps
the
fellow
was
a
droll
,
and
wanted
to
entertain
himself
at
my
expence
.
    
<EOS>
The
day
was
so
far
consumed
in
these
adventures
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
take
up
my
lodging
at
Mechlin
,
where
I
addressed
myself
to
the
intendant
,
giving
him
an
account
of
the
disaster
I
had
met
with
,
and
desiring
I
might
have
credit
at
the
inn
,
as
our
whole
company
could
not
raise
the
value
of
a
six
-
pence
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
,
tho
'
<EOS>
a
provincial
,
was
polite
in
his
way
,
and
not
only
granted
my
request
,
but
invited
me
to
lodge
at
his
own
house
.
<EOS>
I
accordingly
gave
him
my
company
at
supper
,
but
did
not
choose
to
sleep
in
his
quarters
,
because
he
appeared
to
be
what
the
French
call
un
vieux
debauche
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
,
he
sent
a
trumpet
to
the
general
,
with
a
detail
of
my
misfortune
,
in
hopes
of
retrieving
what
I
had
lost
;
but
,
notwithstanding
all
possible
search
,
I
was
fain
to
put
up
with
my
damage
,
which
,
in
linen
,
laces
,
cloaths
and
baubles
,
amounted
to
upwards
of
seven
hundred
pounds
:
a
loss
which
never
deprived
me
of
one
moment
's
rest
;
for
though
I
lodged
at
a
miserable
inn
,
and
lay
in
a
paultry
bed
,
I
slept
as
sound
as
if
nothing
extraordinary
had
happened
,
after
I
had
written
to
London
and
Paris
,
directing
that
the
payment
of
my
bills
of
credit
might
be
stopp'd
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
know
<EOS>
but
of
two
misfortunes
in
life
,
capable
of
depressing
my
spirits
,
namely
,
the
loss
of
health
and
friends
;
all
others
may
be
prevented
,
or
endured
.
<EOS>
The
articles
of
that
calamity
,
which
I
chiefly
regretted
,
were
a
picture
of
lord
W####m
,
and
some
inimitable
letters
from
Mr
B
#
#
#
#
.
    
<EOS>
From
Mechlin
I
proceeded
to
Brussels
,
where
being
known
,
I
got
credit
for
some
necessaries
,
and
borrowed
twenty
guineas
,
to
defray
the
expence
of
my
journey
to
Paris
.
<EOS>
Having
consulted
with
my
friends
,
about
the
safest
method
of
travelling
through
Flanders
,
I
was
persuaded
to
take
places
in
the
public
Voiture
;
and
accordingly
departed
,
not
without
fears
of
finding
one
part
of
the
country
as
much
infested
with
robbers
as
another
.
<EOS>
Nor
were
these
apprehensions
assuaged
by
the
conversation
of
my
fellow
-
travellers
,
who
being
of
the
lower
sort
of
people
,
that
delight
in
exaggerating
dangers
,
entertained
me
all
the
way
,
with
an
account
of
all
the
robberies
and
murders
which
had
been
committed
on
that
road
,
with
many
additional
circumstances
of
their
own
invention
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
been
two
days
exposed
to
this
comfortable
conversation
,
among
very
disagreeable
company
,
which
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
disagreeable
situations
in
life
,
I
arrived
at
Lisle
,
where
,
thinking
the
dangerous
part
of
the
journey
was
now
past
,
I
hired
a
post
-
chaise
,
and
in
two
days
more
reached
Paris
,
without
any
farther
molestation
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
my
arrival
in
this
capital
,
I
was
immediately
visited
by
my
old
acquaintances
,
who
hearing
my
disaster
,
offered
me
their
cloaths
,
and
insisted
upon
my
wearing
them
,
until
I
could
be
otherwise
provided
.
<EOS>
They
likewise
engaged
me
in
parties
,
with
a
view
of
amusing
my
imagination
,
that
I
might
not
grow
melancholy
in
reflecting
upon
my
loss
;
and
desired
me
to
repeat
the
particulars
of
my
story
forty
times
over
,
expressing
great
surprize
at
our
not
being
murthered
,
or
ravished
at
least
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
this
last
species
of
outrage
,
the
fear
of
it
never
once
entered
my
head
,
otherwise
I
should
have
been
more
shocked
and
alarmed
than
I
really
was
:
but
it
seems
this
was
the
chief
circumstance
of
my
companion
's
apprehension
;
and
I
can
not
help
observing
,
that
an
homely
woman
is
always
more
apt
to
entertain
those
fears
,
than
one
whose
person
exposes
her
to
much
more
imminent
danger
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
now
learned
,
that
the
risk
I
ran
was
much
greater
than
I
imagined
it
to
be
,
those
ruffians
being
familiarized
to
rape
as
well
as
murder
.
    
<EOS>
Soon
after
my
appearance
in
Paris
,
I
was
favoured
with
the
addresses
of
several
French
lovers
;
but
I
never
had
any
taste
for
foreigners
,
or
indeed
for
any
amusement
of
that
kind
,
except
such
as
were
likely
to
be
lasting
,
and
settled
upon
a
more
agreeable
footing
than
that
of
common
gallantry
.
<EOS>
When
I
deviated
from
this
principle
,
my
conduct
was
the
effect
of
compulsion
,
and
therefore
I
was
never
easy
under
it
,
having
been
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
two
evils
,
the
least
of
which
I
was
obliged
to
choose
,
as
a
man
leaps
into
the
sea
,
in
order
to
escape
from
a
ship
that
is
on
fire
.
    
<EOS>
Though
I
rejected
their
love
,
I
did
not
refuse
their
company
and
conversation
;
and
though
my
health
was
considerably
impaired
by
the
shock
I
received
in
my
last
adventure
,
which
was
considerably
greater
than
I
at
first
imagined
,
and
affected
my
companion
so
much
,
that
she
did
not
recover
her
spirits
,
till
she
returned
to
England
:
    
I
say
,
though
I
was
for
some
time
a
valetudinarian
,
I
enjoyed
myself
in
great
tranquillity
for
the
space
of
ten
months
,
during
which
I
was
visited
by
English
,
Scotch
,
and
French
,
of
all
parties
and
persuasions
;
for
pleasure
is
of
no
faction
,
and
that
was
the
chief
object
of
my
pursuit
;
neither
was
I
so
ambitious
of
being
a
politician
,
as
to
employ
my
time
and
thoughts
upon
subjects
which
I
did
not
understand
.
<EOS>
I
had
admirers
of
all
sides
,
and
should
have
spent
my
time
very
much
to
my
liking
,
<EOS>
had
not
I
felt
my
funds
sensibly
diminish
,
without
any
prospect
of
their
being
repaired
;
for
I
had
been
obliged
to
lay
out
a
great
part
of
the
sum
allotted
for
my
subsistence
,
in
supplying
my
companion
,
my
servant
and
myself
with
necessaries
,
in
lieu
of
those
which
we
had
lost
.
    
<EOS>
Having
before
mine
eyes
the
uncomfortable
prospect
of
wanting
money
in
a
strange
place
,
I
found
myself
under
the
necessity
of
returning
to
England
,
where
I
had
more
resources
than
I
could
possibly
have
among
foreigners
;
and
with
that
view
wrote
to
lord
  
's
agents
,
desiring
that
I
might
be
enabled
to
discharge
my
obligations
at
Paris
,
by
the
payment
of
my
pin
-
money
.
<EOS>
Thus
a
negotiation
commenced
,
and
his
lordship
promised
to
remit
money
for
the
clearance
of
my
Paris
debts
,
which
amounted
to
four
hundred
pounds
:
but
he
would
not
advance
one
farthing
more
,
though
I
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
while
he
protracted
the
agreement
,
I
must
inevitably
be
adding
to
my
incumbrances
,
and
that
I
should
be
as
effectually
detained
by
a
debt
of
twenty
pounds
,
as
if
I
owed
a
thousand
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
my
representation
,
he
would
not
part
with
one
shilling
over
the
neat
sum
which
I
had
at
first
stipulated
;
so
that
all
my
measures
were
rendered
abortive
,
and
I
found
it
altogether
impracticable
to
execute
those
resolutions
I
had
formed
in
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
did
he
,
for
a
meer
trifle
,
embarrass
the
woman
for
<EOS>
he
professes
the
most
unlimited
love
,
and
whose
principles
he
pretends
to
hold
in
the
utmost
veneration
.
<EOS>
Indeed
his
confidence
in
my
integrity
is
not
without
foundation
;
for
many
wives
,
with
one
half
of
my
provocation
,
would
have
ruined
him
to
all
intents
and
purposes
;
whereas
,
notwithstanding
all
the
extraordinary
expences
,
to
which
I
have
been
exposed
by
his
continual
persecution
,
he
never
paid
a
shilling
on
my
account
,
except
one
thousand
pounds
,
exclusive
of
the
small
allowance
which
was
my
due
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
so
much
time
elapsed
before
my
lord
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
advance
the
bare
four
hundred
,
that
I
was
involved
in
fresh
difficulties
,
from
which
I
found
it
impossible
to
extricate
myself
:
and
though
I
had
occasion
to
write
a
letter
to
my
benefactor
<EOS>
lord
  
,
in
which
I
expressed
my
acknowledgment
for
past
favours
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
venture
to
sollicit
more
;
even
when
I
was
encouraged
by
a
very
obliging
answer
,
wherein
he
declared
,
that
the
good
qualities
of
my
mind
and
heart
,
would
bind
him
to
me
in
friendship
for
ever
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
ruminated
on
my
uncomfortable
situation
,
which
would
neither
permit
me
to
return
to
England
,
nor
to
stay
much
longer
where
I
was
,
a
young
Englishman
of
immense
fortune
took
Paris
in
his
way
from
Italy
,
accompanied
by
a
most
agreeable
Scotchman
of
very
good
sense
and
great
vivacity
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
my
good
or
ill
fortune
to
become
acquainted
with
these
gentlemen
,
who
having
seen
me
at
the
opera
,
expressed
a
desire
of
being
known
to
me
,
and
accordingly
favoured
me
with
a
visit
one
afternoon
,
when
the
brisk
North
Briton
ingrossed
the
whole
conversation
;
while
the
other
seemed
fearful
and
diffident
even
to
a
degree
of
bashfulness
,
through
which
,
however
,
I
could
discern
a
delicate
sensibility
and
uncommon
understanding
:
there
was
in
his
person
(
which
was
very
agreeable
)
as
well
as
in
his
behaviour
,
a
certain
naivet
that
was
very
pleasing
;
and
at
this
first
interview
,
we
relished
each
other
's
company
so
well
,
that
a
sort
of
intimacy
immediately
commenced
,
and
was
carried
on
in
a
succession
of
parties
of
pleasure
,
in
the
course
of
which
I
found
him
fraught
with
all
the
tenderness
and
sentiment
that
render
the
heart
susceptible
of
the
most
refined
love
;
a
disposition
that
immediately
made
me
partial
to
him
,
while
it
subjected
his
own
heart
to
all
the
violent
impressions
of
a
passion
,
which
I
little
imagined
our
correspondence
would
have
produced
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
was
far
from
being
displeased
with
my
conquest
,
because
his
person
and
qualifications
,
as
well
as
his
manner
of
address
,
were
very
much
to
my
liking
,
and
recommended
him
in
a
particular
manner
to
my
affection
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
made
a
greater
progress
in
my
heart
than
I
myself
suspected
;
for
there
was
something
congenial
in
our
souls
,
which
from
our
first
meeting
I
believe
had
attracted
us
(
unknown
to
ourselves
)
under
the
notions
of
friendship
and
regard
,
and
now
disclosed
itself
in
the
most
passionate
love
.
    
<EOS>
I
listened
to
his
addresses
,
and
we
were
truly
happy
.
<EOS>
His
attachment
was
the
quintessence
of
tenderness
and
sincerity
,
while
his
generosity
knew
no
bounds
.
<EOS>
Not
contented
with
having
paid
twelve
hundred
pounds
on
my
account
,
in
the
space
of
one
fortnight
,
he
would
have
loaded
me
with
present
after
present
,
had
not
I
absolutely
refused
to
accept
such
expensive
marks
of
his
munificence
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
even
mortified
at
those
instances
of
his
liberality
,
which
my
situation
compelled
me
to
receive
,
lest
,
being
but
little
acquainted
with
my
disposition
,
he
should
suspect
me
of
being
interested
in
my
love
,
and
judge
my
conduct
by
the
malicious
reports
of
common
fame
,
which
(
he
afterwards
owned
)
had
at
first
obtained
such
credit
with
him
,
that
he
believed
our
mutual
attachment
would
not
be
of
long
duration
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
this
particular
,
he
was
soon
undeceived
:
his
heart
,
though
naturally
adapted
for
the
melting
passion
,
had
hitherto
escaped
untouched
by
all
the
ladies
of
Italy
and
France
;
and
therefore
the
first
impressions
were
the
more
deeply
fixed
.
<EOS>
As
he
was
unpractised
in
the
ways
of
common
gallantry
and
deceit
,
the
striking
simplicity
in
his
character
was
the
more
likely
to
engage
the
heart
of
one
who
knew
the
perfidy
of
the
world
,
and
despised
all
the
farce
and
bombast
of
fashionable
profession
,
which
I
had
always
considered
as
the
phrase
of
vanity
and
ostentation
,
rather
than
the
genuine
language
of
love
.
<EOS>
Besides
,
gratitude
had
a
considerable
share
in
augmenting
my
affection
,
which
manifested
itself
in
such
a
warm
,
cordial
,
artless
manner
,
as
increased
his
esteem
,
and
rivetted
his
attachment
;
for
he
could
easily
perceive
,
from
the
whole
tenour
of
my
conduct
,
that
my
breast
was
an
utter
stranger
to
craft
and
dissimulation
:
yet
I
was
at
first
fearful
of
contracting
any
engagement
with
him
,
because
,
being
younger
than
me
,
he
might
be
the
more
apt
to
change
,
and
the
world
might
be
malicious
enough
to
suppose
I
had
practised
upon
his
inexperience
;
but
,
conscious
of
my
own
integrity
,
I
set
slander
at
defiance
,
trusting
to
my
own
behaviour
,
and
his
natural
probity
,
for
the
continuance
of
his
love
.
    
<EOS>
Though
we
did
not
live
together
in
the
same
house
,
the
greatest
part
of
our
time
was
spent
in
each
other
's
company
;
we
dined
and
supped
at
the
same
table
,
frequented
public
places
,
went
upon
parties
to
the
country
,
and
never
parted
,
but
for
a
few
hours
in
the
night
,
which
we
passed
in
the
utmost
impatience
to
meet
again
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
agreeable
manner
did
the
days
roll
on
,
when
my
felicity
was
interrupted
by
a
fit
of
jealousy
with
which
I
happened
to
be
seized
.
<EOS>
I
had
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
a
young
married
lady
,
who
,
though
her
personal
attractions
were
but
slender
,
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
an
agreeable
,
chearful
,
good
-
natured
companion
,
with
a
little
dash
of
the
coquette
in
her
composition
.
<EOS>
This
woman
being
in
very
indigent
circumstances
,
occasioned
by
some
losses
her
husband
had
sustained
,
no
sooner
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
my
lover
,
than
she
formed
the
design
of
making
a
conquest
of
him
.
<EOS>
I
should
have
forgiven
her
for
this
scheme
,
whatever
pangs
it
might
have
cost
me
,
<EOS>
had
I
believed
it
the
effect
of
real
passion
;
but
I
knew
her
too
well
,
to
suppose
her
heart
was
susceptible
of
love
,
and
accordingly
resented
it
.
<EOS>
In
the
execution
of
her
plan
,
she
neglected
nothing
which
she
thought
capable
of
engaging
his
attention
.
<EOS>
She
took
all
opportunities
of
sitting
near
him
at
table
,
ogled
him
in
the
most
palpable
manner
,
directed
her
whole
discourse
to
him
,
trod
upon
his
toes
;
nay
,
I
believe
,
squeezed
his
hand
.
<EOS>
My
blood
boiled
at
her
,
though
my
pride
,
for
some
time
,
enabled
me
to
conceal
my
uneasiness
;
till
at
length
her
behaviour
became
so
arrogant
and
gross
,
that
I
could
no
longer
suppress
my
indignation
,
and
one
day
told
my
lover
,
that
I
would
immediately
renounce
his
correspondence
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
greatly
alarmed
at
this
unexpected
declaration
;
and
when
he
understood
the
cause
of
it
,
assured
me
,
that
for
the
future
he
would
never
exchange
one
word
with
her
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
mark
of
his
sincerity
and
regard
,
I
released
him
from
this
promise
,
which
he
could
not
possibly
keep
,
while
she
and
I
lived
upon
any
terms
;
and
we
continued
to
visit
each
other
as
usual
,
though
she
still
persisted
in
her
endeavours
to
rival
me
in
his
affection
,
and
contracted
an
intimacy
with
his
companion
,
who
seemed
to
entertain
a
passion
for
her
,
that
she
might
have
the
more
frequent
opportunities
of
being
among
us
;
for
she
had
no
objection
against
favouring
the
addresses
of
both
.
<EOS>
One
evening
,
I
remember
,
we
set
out
in
my
coach
for
the
opera
;
and
in
the
way
,
this
inamorata
was
so
busy
with
her
feet
,
that
I
was
incensed
at
her
behaviour
;
and
when
we
arrived
at
the
place
,
refused
to
alight
;
but
,
setting
them
down
,
declared
my
intention
of
returning
home
immediately
.
<EOS>
She
was
so
much
pleased
with
this
intimation
,
that
she
could
not
conceal
the
joy
she
felt
at
the
thoughts
of
conversing
with
him
,
uninterrupted
by
my
presence
;
an
opportunity
with
which
I
had
never
favoured
her
before
.
<EOS>
This
open
exultation
increased
my
anger
and
anxiety
:
I
went
home
;
but
,
being
still
tortured
with
the
reflection
of
having
left
them
together
,
adjusted
myself
in
the
glass
,
though
I
was
too
angry
to
take
notice
of
my
own
figure
,
and
without
farther
delay
returned
to
the
opera
.
    
<EOS>
Having
inquired
for
the
box
in
which
they
sat
,
I
took
possession
of
one
that
fronted
them
,
and
reconnoitring
them
,
without
being
perceived
,
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
him
removed
to
as
great
a
distance
from
her
as
the
place
would
permit
,
and
his
head
turned
another
way
.
<EOS>
Composed
by
this
examination
,
I
joined
them
without
further
scruple
,
when
my
young
gentleman
expressed
great
joy
at
my
appearance
,
and
told
me
he
was
determined
to
have
left
the
entertainment
,
and
come
in
quest
of
me
,
had
not
I
returned
at
that
instant
.
    
<EOS>
In
our
way
homewards
,
my
rival
repeated
her
usual
hints
,
and
with
her
large
hoop
almost
overshadowed
my
lover
from
my
view
:
upon
which
my
jealousy
and
wrath
recurred
with
such
violence
,
that
I
pulled
the
string
,
as
a
signal
for
the
coachman
to
stop
,
with
a
view
of
getting
out
,
and
going
home
afoot
;
a
step
which
would
have
afforded
a
new
spectacle
to
the
people
of
Paris
.
<EOS>
But
I
reflected
,
in
a
moment
,
upon
the
folly
of
such
a
resolution
,
and
soon
recollected
myself
,
by
calling
my
pride
to
my
assistance
.
<EOS>
I
determined
,
however
,
that
she
should
act
no
more
scenes
of
this
kind
in
my
presence
,
and
that
same
night
insisted
upon
my
lover
's
dropping
all
intercourse
and
connexion
with
this
tormentor
.
<EOS>
He
very
chearfully
complied
with
my
desire
,
and
was
even
glad
of
an
occasion
to
break
off
his
acquaintance
with
a
person
about
whom
I
had
plagued
him
so
much
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
was
I
freed
from
the
persecution
of
one
of
those
creatures
,
who
,
tho
'
of
little
consequence
in
themselves
,
are
yet
the
pests
of
society
,
and
find
means
to
destroy
that
harmony
which
reigns
between
two
lovers
,
by
the
intrusion
of
a
loose
appetite
,
void
of
all
sensibility
and
discretion
:
having
no
feeling
themselves
<EOS>
,
they
can
not
sympathize
with
that
of
other
people
,
and
do
mischief
out
of
meer
wantonness
.
    
<EOS>
My
lover
being
obliged
to
go
to
England
,
had
settled
me
in
a
genteel
house
in
Paris
,
with
a
view
of
returning
when
his
affairs
should
be
adjusted
;
but
when
the
time
of
his
departure
approached
,
he
began
to
be
uneasy
at
the
prospect
of
separation
,
and
,
in
order
to
alleviate
his
anxiety
,
desired
me
to
accompany
him
to
Calais
,
where
we
stayed
together
three
or
four
days
,
during
which
the
dread
of
parting
became
more
and
more
intense
:
<EOS>
so
that
we
determined
upon
my
following
him
into
England
,
by
the
first
opportunity
,
where
I
should
live
altogether
incog
,
that
I
might
be
concealed
from
the
inquiries
and
attempts
of
my
lord
.
<EOS>
Even
after
this
resolution
was
fixed
,
we
parted
with
all
the
agonies
of
lovers
who
despair
of
ever
meeting
again
;
and
the
wind
blowing
very
high
after
he
had
imbarked
,
increased
my
fears
.
<EOS>
But
by
the
return
of
the
packet
-
boat
,
I
was
blessed
with
the
report
of
his
being
safe
arrived
in
England
,
and
had
the
satisfaction
of
perusing
his
letters
by
every
post
.
    
<EOS>
My
admirer
being
thus
detached
from
me
,
my
thoughts
were
intirely
employed
in
concerting
some
private
method
of
conveying
myself
to
him
.
<EOS>
As
I
would
not
trust
myself
in
the
common
packet
,
for
fear
of
being
discovered
,
after
having
revolved
divers
schemes
,
I
determined
to
transport
myself
in
one
of
the
Dutch
fishing
-
boats
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
knew
the
passage
would
be
hazardous
;
but
,
in
a
case
of
such
interesting
concern
,
I
overlooked
all
danger
and
inconvenience
.
    
<EOS>
Before
I
put
this
resolution
in
practice
,
I
was
so
fortunate
as
to
hear
of
a
small
English
vessel
that
arrived
at
Calais
with
a
prisoner
of
war
,
in
which
I
embarked
with
my
companion
,
and
another
lady
,
who
lived
with
me
for
some
time
afterwards
;
and
when
we
came
on
board
,
discovered
that
the
ship
was
no
other
than
a
light
collier
,
and
that
her
whole
company
amounted
to
no
more
than
three
men
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
tho
'
the
sea
was
so
rough
,
and
the
weather
so
unpromising
,
that
no
other
boat
would
venture
to
put
to
sea
,
we
set
sail
,
and
between
two
storms
,
in
about
three
hours
arrived
in
safety
at
Dover
.
    
<EOS>
From
hence
my
first
companion
went
to
her
friends
,
in
the
stage
-
coach
,
while
the
other
lady
and
I
hired
an
open
post
-
chaise
(
tho
'
it
snowed
very
hard
)
and
without
any
accident
performed
our
journey
to
London
,
where
I
met
with
my
lover
,
who
flew
to
my
arms
in
all
the
transports
of
impatient
joy
;
and
,
doubtless
,
I
deserved
his
affection
,
for
the
hardships
,
perils
,
and
difficulties
I
had
undergone
to
be
with
him
;
for
I
never
scrupled
to
undertake
any
thing
practicable
,
in
order
to
demonstrate
the
sincerity
of
what
I
professed
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
our
plan
,
I
assumed
a
fictitious
name
,
and
never
appeared
in
publick
,
being
fully
satisfied
and
happy
in
the
company
and
conversation
of
the
man
I
loved
;
and
when
he
went
into
the
country
,
contented
myself
with
his
correspondence
,
which
he
punctually
maintained
,
in
a
series
of
letters
equally
sensible
,
sincere
and
affectionate
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
his
return
to
town
for
the
remainder
of
the
season
,
he
devoted
the
greatest
part
of
his
time
to
our
mutual
enjoyment
;
left
me
with
reluctance
,
when
he
was
called
away
by
indispensible
business
,
and
the
civility
which
was
due
to
his
acquaintance
,
and
very
seldom
went
to
any
place
of
publick
entertainment
,
because
I
could
not
accompany
and
share
with
him
in
the
diversion
:
<EOS>
nay
,
so
much
did
I
ingross
his
attention
,
that
one
evening
,
after
he
had
been
teized
into
an
agreement
of
meeting
some
friends
at
a
play
,
he
went
thither
precisely
at
the
appointed
hour
,
and
as
they
did
not
arrive
punctually
at
the
very
minute
,
he
returned
to
me
immediately
,
as
much
rejoiced
at
his
escape
as
if
he
had
met
with
some
signal
deliverance
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
constancy
inferior
to
the
ardour
of
his
love
:
we
went
once
together
to
a
ball
in
the
Hay
-
market
,
where
,
in
the
midst
of
a
thousand
fine
women
,
whose
charms
were
inhanced
by
the
peculiarity
of
the
dresses
they
wore
,
he
remained
unshaken
,
unseduced
,
preserving
his
attachment
for
me
,
in
spite
of
all
temptation
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
summer
he
provided
me
with
a
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
his
own
;
but
the
accommodations
being
bad
,
and
that
country
affording
no
other
place
fit
for
my
residence
,
he
brought
me
home
to
his
own
seat
,
and
by
that
step
raised
an
universal
clamour
,
tho
'
<EOS>
I
saw
no
company
,
and
led
such
a
solitary
life
,
that
nothing
but
excessive
love
could
have
supported
my
spirits
:
not
but
that
he
gave
me
as
much
of
his
time
as
he
could
possibly
spare
from
the
necessary
duties
of
paying
and
receiving
visits
,
together
with
the
avocations
of
hunting
,
and
other
country
amusements
,
which
I
could
not
partake
.
<EOS>
Formerly
,
indeed
,
I
used
to
hunt
and
shoot
,
but
I
had
left
off
both
;
so
that
I
was
now
reduced
to
the
alternative
of
reading
and
walking
by
myself
:
but
,
Love
made
up
for
all
deficiencies
to
me
,
who
think
nothing
else
worth
the
living
for
!
  
<EOS>
Had
I
been
blessed
with
a
partner
for
life
,
who
could
have
loved
sincerely
,
and
inspired
me
with
a
mutual
flame
,
I
would
have
asked
no
more
of
fate
.
<EOS>
Interest
and
ambition
have
no
share
in
my
composition
;
love
which
is
pleasure
,
or
pleasure
which
is
love
,
makes
up
the
whole
.
<EOS>
A
heart
so
disposed
can
not
be
devoid
of
other
good
qualities
;
it
must
be
subject
to
the
impressions
of
humanity
and
benevolence
,
and
enemy
to
nothing
but
itself
.
<EOS>
This
you
will
give
me
leave
to
affirm
,
in
justice
to
myself
,
as
I
have
frankly
owned
my
failings
and
misconduct
.
    
<EOS>
Towards
the
end
of
summer
my
heart
was
a
little
alarmed
by
a
report
that
prevailed
,
of
my
lover
's
being
actually
engaged
in
a
treaty
of
marriage
:
however
,
I
gave
little
credit
to
this
rumour
,
till
I
was
obliged
to
go
to
town
about
business
,
and
there
I
heard
the
same
information
confidently
affirmed
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
I
still
considered
it
as
a
vague
surmise
,
I
wrote
to
him
an
account
of
what
I
had
heard
;
and
in
his
answer
,
which
is
still
in
my
possession
,
he
assured
me
,
with
repeated
vows
and
protestations
,
that
the
report
was
altogether
false
.
<EOS>
Satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
I
returned
to
his
house
;
and
tho
'
the
tale
was
incessantly
thundered
in
my
ears
,
still
believed
it
void
of
all
foundation
,
till
my
suspicion
was
awaked
by
a
very
inconsiderable
circumstance
.
    
<EOS>
One
day
,
on
his
return
from
hunting
,
I
perceived
he
had
a
very
fine
pair
of
Dresden
ruffles
on
his
shirt
,
which
I
could
not
suppose
he
would
wear
at
such
a
rustic
exercise
;
and
therefore
my
fears
immediately
took
the
alarm
.
    
<EOS>
When
I
questioned
him
about
this
particular
of
his
dress
,
his
colour
changed
;
and
tho
'
he
attempted
to
elude
my
suspicion
,
by
imputing
it
to
a
mistake
of
his
servant
<EOS>
,
I
could
not
rest
satisfied
with
this
account
of
the
matter
,
but
inquired
into
the
truth
with
such
eagerness
and
penetration
,
that
he
could
not
deny
he
had
been
to
make
a
visit
;
and
,
by
degrees
,
I
even
extorted
from
him
a
confession
,
that
he
had
engaged
himself
farther
than
he
ought
to
have
proceeded
,
without
making
me
acquainted
with
his
design
,
tho
'
he
endeavoured
to
excuse
his
conduct
,
and
pacify
my
displeasure
,
by
saying
that
the
affair
would
not
be
brought
to
bear
for
a
great
while
,
and
perhaps
might
never
come
to
a
determination
:
but
he
was
in
great
confusion
,
and
indeed
hardly
knew
what
he
said
.
    
<EOS>
I
would
have
quitted
his
house
that
moment
,
had
not
he
,
before
-
hand
,
obtained
a
promise
that
I
would
take
no
rash
resolution
of
that
kind
,
and
put
it
out
of
my
power
to
procure
any
method
of
conveyance
by
which
I
could
make
my
retreat
.
<EOS>
I
gave
no
vent
to
reproaches
,
and
only
upbraided
him
with
his
having
permitted
me
to
return
in
ignorance
to
the
country
,
<EOS>
after
I
was
once
fairly
gone
:
upon
which
he
swore
that
he
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
parting
with
me
.
<EOS>
This
declaration
was
a
mystery
at
that
time
,
but
I
have
been
since
so
fully
satisfied
of
his
reasons
for
his
conduct
,
that
I
heartily
acquit
him
of
all
injustice
to
me
.
<EOS>
And
indeed
,
it
is
my
sincere
opinion
,
that
if
ever
young
man
deserved
to
be
happy
,
he
is
certainly
intitled
to
that
privilege
;
and
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
judge
,
has
an
heart
susceptible
of
the
most
refined
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
The
violence
of
the
grief
and
consternation
which
I
suffered
from
this
stroke
,
having
a
little
subsided
<EOS>
,
I
deliberated
with
myself
about
the
measures
I
should
take
,
and
determined
to
leave
his
house
some
day
when
he
should
be
abroad
.
    
<EOS>
I
was
encouraged
in
this
resolution
by
the
advice
of
our
Scotch
friend
,
who
came
about
this
time
from
London
,
on
a
visit
to
his
fellow
-
traveller
:
we
thought
such
an
abrupt
departure
would
be
less
shocking
than
to
stay
and
take
a
formal
leave
of
my
lover
,
whose
heart
was
of
such
a
delicate
frame
,
that
after
I
told
him
I
should
one
day
withdraw
myself
,
in
his
absence
,
he
never
came
home
from
the
chace
,
or
any
other
avocation
,
without
trembling
with
apprehension
that
I
had
escaped
.
    
<EOS>
After
he
had
been
some
time
accustomed
to
these
fears
by
my
previous
intimation
,
I
at
length
decamped
,
in
good
earnest
,
tho
'
my
heart
aked
upon
the
occasion
,
because
I
left
him
loving
and
beloved
;
for
his
affection
was
evident
,
notwithstanding
the
step
he
had
taken
,
by
the
advice
and
importunity
of
all
his
relations
,
who
laid
a
disagreeable
restraint
upon
his
inclinations
,
while
they
consulted
his
interest
in
every
other
particular
.
    
<EOS>
While
I
halted
in
the
next
great
town
,
until
I
could
be
supplied
with
fresh
horses
,
I
was
visited
by
a
gentleman
who
had
been
formerly
intimate
with
my
lover
;
but
a
breach
had
happened
in
their
friendship
,
and
he
now
came
to
complain
of
the
treatment
he
had
received
.
<EOS>
Perceiving
that
I
was
not
in
a
humour
to
listen
to
his
story
,
he
shifted
the
conversation
to
my
own
,
and
observed
,
that
I
had
been
extremely
ill
used
.
    
<EOS>
I
told
him
I
was
of
a
different
opinion
:
<EOS>
that
it
was
not
only
just
,
but
expedient
,
that
a
young
man
of
Mr
  
's
fortune
should
think
of
making
some
alliance
to
strengthen
and
support
the
interest
of
his
family
;
and
that
I
had
nothing
to
accuse
him
of
<EOS>
but
his
letting
me
remain
so
long
in
ignorance
of
his
intention
.
<EOS>
He
then
gave
me
to
understand
,
that
I
was
still
ignorant
of
a
great
part
of
the
ill
usage
I
had
received
,
affirming
,
that
while
I
lived
in
his
house
,
he
had
amused
himself
with
all
the
common
women
in
that
town
,
to
some
of
whom
this
gentleman
had
personally
introduced
him
.
    
<EOS>
At
first
,
I
could
not
believe
this
imputation
;
but
he
supported
his
assertions
with
so
many
convincing
circumstances
,
that
I
could
no
longer
doubt
the
truth
of
them
;
and
I
felt
so
much
resentment
,
that
my
love
vanished
immediately
into
air
.
<EOS>
Instead
of
proceeding
in
my
journey
to
London
,
I
went
back
a
considerable
way
,
and
sent
a
message
,
desiring
to
see
him
in
a
little
house
,
about
mid
way
between
his
own
habitation
and
the
town
from
whence
<EOS>
I
came
.
<EOS>
He
obeyed
my
summons
,
and
appeared
at
the
place
appointed
,
where
I
reproached
him
with
great
bitterness
.
<EOS>
He
pleaded
guilty
to
the
charge
,
so
far
as
acknowledging
that
he
had
corresponded
with
other
women
lately
,
in
order
to
get
the
better
of
his
affection
for
me
,
but
the
experiment
had
failed
,
and
he
found
that
he
should
be
for
ever
miserable
.
    
<EOS>
I
did
not
look
upon
this
candid
confession
as
a
sufficient
atonement
for
his
past
dissimulation
,
and
,
in
the
sharpness
of
my
revenge
,
demanded
a
settlement
,
which
he
peremptorily
refused
;
so
that
,
for
the
present
,
we
held
each
other
in
the
utmost
contempt
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
afterwards
despised
myself
for
my
condescension
,
which
was
owing
to
the
advice
of
my
companion
,
supported
and
inflamed
by
the
spirit
of
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
begged
that
I
would
return
to
his
house
,
or
stay
all
night
where
I
was
;
but
I
was
deaf
to
his
intreaties
,
and
,
after
a
great
deal
of
ironical
civility
on
my
side
,
I
took
my
leave
,
and
went
away
;
<EOS>
yet
,
before
I
set
out
,
I
looked
back
,
and
saw
him
on
horseback
,
with
such
an
air
of
simplicity
and
truth
,
as
called
up
a
profound
sigh
,
notwithstanding
all
that
had
passed
in
our
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
my
arrival
in
London
,
I
took
lodgings
in
Leicester
-
Fields
,
and
answered
a
letter
which
I
had
some
months
before
received
from
my
lord
;
telling
him
,
that
I
would
go
home
to
him
,
without
stipulating
for
any
terms
,
to
try
what
effect
my
confidence
would
have
upon
his
generosity
.
<EOS>
He
readily
embraced
the
offer
,
and
took
an
house
in
St
James
's
street
,
where
I
proposed
to
comply
with
his
humour
in
every
thing
that
was
consistent
with
my
own
peace
and
tranquillity
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
my
lover
passed
his
time
very
disagreeably
in
the
country
,
with
his
friend
,
of
whom
(
it
seems
)
he
had
conceived
some
jealousy
,
which
was
increased
by
a
letter
I
wrote
to
that
gentleman
,
till
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
contents
,
which
he
read
over
forty
times
;
and
then
his
passion
breaking
out
with
more
violence
than
ever
<EOS>
,
he
not
only
expressed
his
feeling
,
in
an
epistle
which
I
immediately
received
,
but
when
he
came
to
town
,
suffered
such
agonies
of
despair
as
I
had
never
seen
before
,
except
in
lord
B
#
#
#
#
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
then
in
my
power
to
have
taken
ample
revenge
upon
him
,
as
well
as
upon
my
insolent
rival
,
who
had
insisted
upon
my
leaving
his
house
,
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
,
tho
'
he
absolutely
refused
to
gratify
her
malice
;
for
he
was
now
disposed
to
do
any
thing
for
my
satisfaction
:
but
I
knew
his
worth
,
and
had
too
much
regard
for
his
reputation
to
advise
him
to
act
inconsistent
with
his
honour
.
    
<EOS>
About
this
time
,
many
tender
meetings
and
sorrowful
partings
happened
between
us
,
till
the
marriage
-
knot
was
tied
,
when
he
sent
me
a
bank
-
note
for
a
thousand
pounds
,
by
way
of
specimen
(
as
he
called
it
)
of
his
friendship
,
and
of
what
he
would
do
for
me
,
should
I
ever
want
his
assistance
.
<EOS>
This
mark
of
his
generosity
I
received
in
a
most
tender
billet
,
which
I
shall
never
part
with
,
together
with
his
picture
set
in
diamonds
.
    
<EOS>
I
now
employed
my
thoughts
in
keeping
measures
with
my
lord
;
we
lay
in
the
same
apartment
,
and
for
the
first
four
or
five
months
I
neither
dined
nor
supped
abroad
,
above
twice
;
and
then
he
knew
where
I
was
,
and
approved
of
my
company
.
<EOS>
But
all
this
complacency
and
circumspection
had
no
effect
upon
his
temper
,
which
remained
as
capricious
and
dissatisfied
as
ever
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
to
such
a
provoking
degree
did
this
unhappy
humour
prevail
,
that
one
day
,
in
the
presence
of
his
lawyer
,
he
harrangued
upon
my
misconduct
since
our
last
re
-
union
;
and
very
freely
affirmed
,
that
every
step
I
had
taken
was
diametrically
opposite
to
his
will
.
    
<EOS>
Conscious
of
the
pains
I
had
been
at
to
please
him
<EOS>
,
I
was
so
incensed
at
these
unjust
invectives
,
<EOS>
that
starting
up
,
I
told
him
he
was
a
little
dirty
fellow
;
and
would
have
left
the
house
immediately
,
had
not
his
lawyer
,
and
others
,
who
were
in
the
next
room
,
interposed
,
and
by
dint
of
argument
and
importunity
diverted
me
from
my
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
I
have
been
informed
by
a
person
of
rank
,
that
my
lord
discovered
exactly
the
same
disposition
in
his
father
's
life
-
time
,
and
only
changes
the
subject
of
his
complaint
from
the
word
father
to
that
of
wife
.
<EOS>
Indeed
he
takes
all
opportunities
of
plaguing
my
dear
parent
,
as
he
has
just
sagacity
enough
to
know
,
that
this
is
the
most
effectual
way
he
can
take
to
distress
me
.
    
<EOS>
After
repeated
trials
,
I
have
given
up
all
hopes
of
making
him
happy
,
or
of
finding
myself
easy
in
my
situation
;
and
live
with
him
at
present
to
avoid
a
greater
inconvenience
.
<EOS>
Not
that
his
ill
-
nature
is
all
the
grievance
of
which
I
complain
:
exclusive
of
the
personal
disgust
I
entertain
for
him
,
his
folly
is
of
that
species
which
disobliges
rather
than
diverts
,
and
his
vanity
and
affectation
altogether
intolerable
;
for
he
actually
believes
himself
,
or
at
least
would
impose
himself
upon
mankind
,
as
a
pattern
in
gallantry
and
taste
;
and
,
in
point
of
business
,
a
person
of
infinite
sagacity
and
penetration
:
but
the
most
ridiculous
part
of
his
character
is
his
pretended
talent
for
politics
,
in
which
he
so
deeply
concerns
himself
,
that
he
has
dismissed
many
a
good
servant
,
because
he
suspected
him
of
having
wrong
connexions
;
a
theme
upon
which
he
has
often
quarrelled
with
me
,
even
almost
to
parting
,
accusing
me
of
holding
correspondence
with
the
earls
of
B
#
#
#
#
and
C
#
#
#
#
,
and
Mr
H
#
#
#
#
V
#
#
#
#
tho
<EOS>
'
I
never
had
the
least
acquaintance
with
any
of
these
gentlemen
,
except
the
earl
of
C
#
#
#
#
,
to
whom
I
have
not
spoke
for
these
ten
years
past
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
have
often
been
at
a
loss
to
know
,
whether
he
was
more
mad
or
malicious
in
those
fits
of
enthusiasm
<EOS>
,
wherein
he
seemed
transported
with
zeal
for
the
commonwealth
,
and
tormented
me
with
his
admonitions
,
out
of
all
temper
and
patience
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
I
contrived
an
expedient
which
freed
me
from
these
troublesome
expostulations
,
and
silenced
him
effectually
on
the
score
of
politicks
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
other
than
an
open
avowal
of
being
connected
with
all
those
people
whom
I
have
named
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
knew
him
too
well
to
believe
there
was
any
thing
solid
in
his
intention
or
professions
,
even
when
he
carried
them
so
far
as
to
demand
a
private
audience
of
the
K
#
#
#
#
,
in
order
to
communicate
a
scheme
for
suppressing
the
rebellion
;
and
that
being
denied
,
sollicited
the
duke
of
D
#
#
#
#
's
interest
,
for
permission
to
raise
and
head
a
regiment
of
Kentish
smugglers
:
nay
,
to
<EOS>
such
a
pitch
did
his
loyalty
soar
,
that
he
purchased
a
firelock
of
particular
mechanism
,
calculated
for
the
safety
of
the
bearer
,
in
case
he
had
been
placed
centinel
at
his
majesty
's
door
;
and
kept
his
horses
ready
caparisoned
,
with
a
view
of
attending
his
sovereign
to
the
field
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
these
pompous
preparations
,
had
he
been
put
to
the
proof
,
he
would
have
infallibly
crept
out
of
his
engagements
,
thro
'
some
sneaking
evasion
,
his
imagination
being
very
fertile
in
such
saving
pretences
.
<EOS>
Yet
he
will
talk
sometimes
so
fervently
,
and
even
sensibly
,
on
the
subject
,
that
a
stranger
would
mistake
him
for
a
man
of
understanding
,
and
determined
zeal
for
the
good
of
his
country
.
    
<EOS>
Since
my
last
return
to
his
house
,
that
act
of
parliament
passed
,
by
which
he
was
enabled
to
pay
his
debts
,
and
among
the
rest
,
a
thousand
pounds
of
my
contracting
,
the
only
burden
of
that
kind
I
ever
intailed
upon
him
,
exclusive
of
my
pin
-
money
,
which
was
never
regularly
paid
;
nor
would
he
have
been
subject
to
this
,
had
he
not
,
by
his
persecution
and
pursuit
,
exposed
me
to
an
extraordinary
expence
.
<EOS>
I
have
also
had
it
in
my
power
to
reward
some
of
my
faithful
Abigails
;
in
particular
,
to
relieve
from
extreme
distress
that
maid
to
whom
(
as
I
have
already
observed
)
lord
B
<EOS>
#
#
#
#
granted
an
annuity
,
which
she
had
sold
:
so
that
she
was
reduced
to
the
most
abject
poverty
,
and
I
found
her
in
a
dismal
hole
,
with
two
infants
,
perishing
for
want
;
a
spectacle
which
drew
tears
from
my
eyes
,
and
indeed
could
not
but
make
a
deep
impression
upon
an
heart
like
mine
,
which
the
misery
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
never
failed
to
melt
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
did
I
,
upon
this
occasion
,
forget
the
attachment
and
fidelity
of
my
other
woman
Mrs
S
#
#
#
#
,
who
hearing
I
was
robbed
in
my
passage
thro
'
Flanders
,
had
generously
relinquished
the
allowance
I
had
settled
upon
her
at
parting
.
    
<EOS>
The
exercise
of
such
acts
of
humanity
and
benevolence
,
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
my
dear
and
tender
parent
often
,
in
some
measure
alleviate
the
chagrin
to
which
I
am
subject
,
from
the
disagreeable
disposition
of
my
lord
,
who
,
consistent
with
his
former
inconsistency
,
upon
our
last
reconciliation
chearfully
agreed
to
a
proposal
I
made
of
having
concerts
in
the
house
,
and
even
approved
of
the
scheme
with
marks
of
particular
satisfaction
:
but
before
one
half
of
the
winter
was
expired
,
he
found
means
to
banish
all
the
company
,
beginning
with
lord
R
#
#
#
#
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
as
he
walked
up
stairs
one
evening
,
was
stopped
by
a
footman
,
who
plainly
told
him
he
had
orders
to
say
to
him
in
particular
,
that
his
lordship
was
not
at
home
:
yet
the
very
next
day
perceiving
that
nobleman
and
me
walking
together
in
the
park
,
he
joined
us
with
an
air
of
alacrity
,
as
if
no
such
thing
had
happened
,
and
even
behaved
to
lord
R
#
#
#
#
with
the
most
fawning
complaisance
.
<EOS>
His
deportment
was
equally
absurd
and
impertinent
to
the
rest
of
our
friends
,
who
forsook
us
gradually
,
being
tired
of
maintaining
any
friendly
communication
with
such
a
disagreeable
composition
of
ignorance
and
arrogance
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
look
upon
him
as
utterly
incorrigible
;
and
as
fate
hath
subjected
me
to
his
power
,
endeavour
to
make
the
bitter
draught
go
down
,
by
detaching
myself
,
as
much
as
possible
,
from
the
supposition
that
there
is
any
such
existence
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
if
I
had
not
fatal
experience
of
the
contrary
,
I
should
be
apt
to
believe
that
such
a
character
is
not
to
be
found
among
the
sons
of
men
;
because
his
conduct
is
altogether
unaccountable
by
the
known
rules
and
maxims
of
life
,
and
falls
intirely
under
the
poet
's
observation
,
when
he
says
,
@@@Tis
true
,
no
meaning
puzzles
more
than
wit
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
having
thus
concluded
her
story
,
to
the
entertainment
of
the
company
,
and
the
admiration
of
Peregrine
,
who
expressed
his
astonishment
at
the
variety
of
adventure
<EOS>
she
had
undergone
,
which
was
such
as
he
thought
sufficient
to
destroy
the
most
hardy
and
robust
constitution
,
and
therefore
infinitely
more
than
enough
to
overwhelm
one
of
her
delicate
frame
;
one
of
the
gentlemen
present
,
roundly
taxed
her
with
want
of
candour
,
in
suppressing
some
circumstances
of
her
life
,
which
he
thought
essential
in
the
consideration
of
her
character
.
    
<EOS>
She
reddened
at
this
peremptory
charge
,
which
had
an
evident
effect
upon
the
countenances
of
the
whole
audience
,
<EOS>
when
the
accuser
proceeded
to
explain
his
imputation
,
by
observing
,
that
,
in
the
course
of
her
narration
,
she
had
omitted
to
mention
a
thousand
acts
of
uncommon
charity
,
of
which
he
himself
knew
her
to
be
guilty
;
that
she
had
concealed
a
great
many
advantageous
proposals
of
marriage
,
which
she
might
have
accepted
,
before
she
was
engaged
;
that
she
had
not
spoke
one
word
of
her
first
husband
's
debts
,
which
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
she
had
paid
out
of
her
own
privy
purse
,
after
her
second
marriage
,
and
on
that
account
received
the
thanks
of
lord
W
#
#
#
#
's
elder
brother
,
who
,
though
he
had
undertaken
to
discharge
them
,
delayed
the
execution
of
his
purpose
longer
than
she
thought
they
should
remain
unpaid
:
and
that
,
in
relating
her
inducements
for
leaving
Mr
S
#
#
#
#
,
(
whether
out
of
forgetfulness
,
or
from
tenderness
to
a
lover
once
so
dear
to
her
,
he
would
not
pretend
to
say
)
<EOS>
she
had
omitted
a
very
cogent
motive
for
her
own
conduct
;
for
as
he
had
first
courted
her
favour
in
her
rising
fortune
,
and
left
her
in
its
decline
,
she
could
not
avoid
reflecting
,
that
,
after
this
precipitate
re
-
engagement
,
when
the
first
transports
of
their
meeting
were
over
,
he
would
again
act
the
same
conduct
,
as
soon
as
her
tranquillity
should
be
disturbed
by
the
persecution
of
her
lord
.
    
<EOS>
The
company
were
agreeably
undeceived
by
this
explanation
;
which
her
ladyship
acknowledged
in
very
polite
terms
,
as
a
compliment
equally
genteel
and
unexpected
:
and
our
hero
,
after
having
testified
the
sense
he
had
of
her
complaisance
and
condescension
,
in
regaling
him
with
such
a
mark
of
her
confidence
and
esteem
,
took
his
leave
,
and
went
home
in
a
state
of
confusion
and
perplexity
;
for
,
from
the
circumstances
of
the
tale
he
had
heard
,
he
plainly
perceived
,
that
her
ladyship
's
heart
was
too
delicate
to
receive
such
incense
,
as
he
,
in
the
capacity
of
an
admirer
,
could
at
present
pay
;
because
,
though
he
had
in
some
measure
abridged
the
empire
of
Emilia
in
his
own
breast
,
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
restrain
it
so
effectually
,
but
that
it
would
interfere
with
any
other
sovereign
whom
his
thoughts
should
adopt
:
and
,
unless
lady
 
could
ingross
his
whole
love
,
time
and
attention
,
he
foresaw
,
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
support
the
passion
which
he
might
have
the
good
fortune
to
inspire
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
moreover
,
deterred
from
declaring
his
love
,
by
the
fate
of
her
former
admirers
,
who
seemed
to
have
been
wound
up
to
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
,
that
looked
more
like
the
effect
of
inchantment
,
than
the
inspiration
of
human
attractions
;
an
extasy
of
passion
which
he
durst
not
venture
to
undergo
;
therefore
resolved
to
combat
with
the
impressions
he
had
already
received
,
and
,
if
possible
,
cultivate
her
friendship
without
soliciting
her
affection
:
but
,
before
he
could
fix
upon
this
determination
,
he
desired
to
know
the
predicament
in
which
he
stood
in
her
opinion
;
and
by
the
intelligence
of
Crabtree
,
obtained
in
the
usual
manner
,
understood
that
her
sentiments
of
him
were
very
favourable
,
though
without
the
least
tincture
of
love
.
<EOS>
He
would
have
been
transported
with
joy
,
had
her
thoughts
of
him
been
of
a
more
tender
texture
;
though
his
reason
was
better
pleased
with
the
information
he
received
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
mustered
up
the
ideas
of
his
first
passion
,
and
set
them
in
opposition
to
those
of
this
new
and
dangerous
attachment
;
by
which
means
,
he
kept
the
balance
in
equilibrio
,
and
his
bosom
tolerably
quiet
.

Chapter
LXXXIX
Peregrine
amuses
his
imagination
,
by
slight
incursions
upon
the
territory
of
vice
and
folly
;
reforms
a
back
-
sliding
brother
,
and
sends
a
celebrated
sharper
into
exile
.
   
<EOS>
His
heart
being
thus
,
<EOS>
as
it
were
,
suspended
between
two
objects
that
lessened
the
force
of
each
other
's
attraction
,
he
took
this
opportunity
of
enjoying
some
respite
,
and
for
the
present
detached
his
sentiments
from
both
;
resolving
to
indulge
himself
in
the
exercise
of
that
practical
satire
,
which
was
so
agreeable
and
peculiar
to
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
In
this
laudable
determination
he
was
confirmed
by
the
repeated
suggestions
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
who
taxed
him
with
letting
his
talents
rust
in
indolence
,
and
stimulated
his
natural
vivacity
,
with
a
succession
of
fresh
discoveries
in
the
world
of
scandal
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
reinforced
,
they
took
the
field
,
and
performed
various
exploits
,
to
the
mortification
,
astonishment
and
dismay
of
all
those
coxcombs
,
whether
male
or
female
,
fierce
or
feeble
,
insolent
or
tame
,
that
hang
like
tatters
on
the
skirts
of
gallantry
,
and
bring
the
fashion
into
disgrace
.
<EOS>
As
I
might
trespass
upon
the
patience
of
the
reader
,
in
giving
a
minute
detail
of
each
adventure
of
this
kind
which
they
atchieved
,
I
shall
content
myself
with
relating
two
only
,
to
which
indeed
all
the
rest
bore
some
resemblance
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
intelligencer
,
who
(
as
we
have
already
observed
)
was
a
privileged
person
in
all
parties
,
happened
one
morning
to
breakfast
with
a
sort
of
a
great
man
,
who
,
with
a
large
stock
of
timorous
superstition
and
exterior
piety
,
had
at
bottom
a
spice
of
carnality
,
which
all
his
religion
could
not
extinguish
.
<EOS>
Among
the
rest
of
his
dependants
,
there
was
a
certain
favourite
,
who
by
the
most
assiduous
attention
to
his
humour
,
in
a
course
of
artful
flattery
and
servile
complaisance
,
had
insinuated
himself
so
far
into
his
confidence
and
esteem
,
that
he
now
acted
in
the
capacity
of
his
counsellor
and
director
,
both
in
his
spiritual
and
temporal
concerns
.
    
<EOS>
This
cunning
parasite
having
discovered
his
patron
's
infirmity
,
began
to
be
afraid
,
that
in
the
instigations
of
the
flesh
,
he
might
be
tempted
to
employ
some
other
agent
for
the
gratification
of
his
appetite
:
and
foreseeing
that
any
minister
of
this
kind
would
infallibly
prove
a
dangerous
rival
to
him
,
in
the
good
graces
of
his
master
,
he
resolved
to
anticipate
the
misfortune
,
and
,
with
his
other
offices
,
monopolize
the
functions
of
a
Mercury
,
for
which
his
talents
were
perfectly
well
adapted
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
not
the
whole
of
his
task
;
he
knew
there
were
certain
qualms
and
scruples
of
conscience
to
be
removed
,
as
well
as
other
motives
of
shyness
and
distrust
,
which
he
durst
not
leave
to
the
operation
of
his
friend
's
own
desires
,
lest
he
should
choose
some
other
confident
;
he
therefore
observed
the
different
seasons
of
his
constitution
,
and
culled
the
proper
opportunities
of
expressing
a
relaxation
in
his
sentiments
of
chastity
;
which
being
gratefully
received
,
he
proceeded
in
the
work
of
conversion
,
already
half
effected
by
his
patron
's
own
passions
;
and
in
conclusion
,
found
a
willing
dame
to
quench
this
fire
that
scorched
his
vitals
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
overnight
obtained
her
consent
,
and
the
particulars
of
their
meeting
were
adjusted
,
in
presence
of
Cadwallader
,
lader
,
who
gave
his
associate
to
understand
that
,
with
a
view
of
keeping
the
rendezvous
secret
and
mysterious
,
as
well
as
of
saving
the
lovers
that
mutual
confusion
which
the
light
must
have
produced
,
the
scene
of
their
interview
was
laid
in
a
summer
-
house
,
that
stood
at
the
end
of
his
garden
,
to
which
the
lady
and
her
conductor
would
be
admitted
in
the
dark
,
through
backdoor
that
should
be
left
open
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
being
made
acquainted
with
these
particulars
,
together
with
the
hour
of
assignation
,
ordered
Pipes
to
purchase
a
live
calf
,
and
carried
it
in
a
sack
,
about
the
twilight
,
to
the
back
-
garden
-
door
,
which
our
hero
entered
without
hesitation
,
disposing
himself
and
his
attendants
in
a
dark
alcove
immediately
under
the
summer
-
house
,
where
(
without
disengaging
the
animal
from
its
covering
)
he
besmeared
its
front
with
liquid
phosphorus
,
and
directed
Tom
to
unveil
,
and
present
it
to
the
company
at
their
approach
,
while
he
himself
absconded
behind
a
pillar
,
from
whence
he
could
view
the
entertainment
.
<EOS>
They
had
continued
a
whole
hour
in
this
situation
,
when
they
perceived
by
star
-
light
,
three
persons
enter
the
postern
,
and
advance
towards
the
place
where
they
lay
;
upon
which
,
Pipes
began
to
disentangle
his
charge
,
that
he
might
be
ready
to
play
it
off
at
the
proper
time
;
but
,
as
he
was
not
very
expert
in
this
business
,
the
calf
finding
itself
disengaged
from
its
confinement
,
sprung
all
of
a
sudden
out
of
his
hands
,
and
running
directly
forwards
,
encountered
those
that
approached
,
and
as
it
passed
them
,
uttered
a
loud
Baa
.
    
<EOS>
The
gallant
,
whose
passions
were
exalted
to
a
pitch
of
enthusiasm
,
as
susceptible
of
religious
horror
as
of
love
,
seeing
such
an
apparition
,
when
he
was
at
the
point
of
indulging
a
criminal
appetite
,
and
hearing
the
dreadful
cry
,
accompanied
with
the
terrible
word
damnation
,
which
Pipes
,
in
his
peculiar
tone
,
exclaimed
from
the
alcove
,
when
the
animal
made
its
escape
;
he
was
seized
with
consternation
and
remorse
,
and
falling
upon
his
face
,
lay
in
all
the
agonies
of
terror
,
believing
himself
warned
by
a
particular
message
from
above
.
<EOS>
His
trusty
squire
,
who
was
not
quite
so
visionary
,
recollecting
himself
from
the
surprize
he
had
suffered
at
the
first
appearance
of
such
a
glaring
phaenomenon
,
which
had
also
such
an
effect
upon
the
lady
,
that
she
ran
out
into
the
fields
,
screaming
all
the
way
:
<EOS>
I
say
,
he
no
sooner
recovered
the
faculty
of
reflection
,
which
this
accident
had
for
some
minutes
taken
away
,
than
he
observed
his
patron
's
prostration
;
and
guessing
the
condition
of
his
thoughts
,
resolved
to
profit
by
his
sagacity
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
laid
himself
gently
down
upon
the
cold
walk
,
and
lay
very
quietly
,
till
the
lover
,
having
in
a
faultring
voice
called
thrice
upon
his
name
,
without
being
favoured
with
an
answer
,
raised
himself
up
,
and
coming
to
the
spot
,
shook
him
by
the
arm
;
upon
which
he
seemed
to
wake
from
his
trance
,
and
in
a
most
penitent
tone
pronounced
a
very
pious
ejaculation
,
which
confirmed
the
opinion
of
his
principal
who
asked
him
with
fear
and
trembling
,
if
he
had
heard
the
voice
and
seen
the
light
.
<EOS>
Being
an
excellent
actor
,
he
replied
with
all
the
marks
of
amazement
,
that
he
was
struck
blind
with
a
gush
of
light
,
far
exceeding
that
of
the
sun
at
noon
,
and
his
ears
appalled
with
a
voice
,
like
the
sound
of
many
waters
,
denouncing
damnation
to
those
who
obey
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
.
    
<EOS>
The
converted
lover
,
though
he
was
not
sensible
of
such
extraordinary
circumstances
of
visitation
,
implicitly
believed
every
tittle
of
his
account
,
imputing
the
difference
of
his
own
perception
to
the
weakness
of
his
organs
,
which
were
sooner
disturbed
than
those
of
his
purveyor
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
proposed
,
that
they
should
adjourn
to
the
chamber
which
had
been
destined
for
the
scene
of
his
transgression
,
and
with
sorrow
and
contrition
ask
pardon
of
heaven
for
his
intended
offence
,
acknowledging
at
the
same
time
,
the
seasonable
and
salutary
interposition
of
providence
.
<EOS>
This
duty
was
accordingly
performed
,
after
they
had
searched
in
vain
for
the
nymph
,
who
(
the
squire
seemed
to
think
)
was
conveyed
by
some
supernatural
means
from
the
garden
;
for
he
said
,
as
he
lay
intranced
upon
the
ground
,
he
heard
a
rattling
like
the
chariots
of
Aminadab
,
and
the
shrieks
of
the
young
woman
gradually
sinking
in
a
distant
cadence
,
as
if
she
had
been
transported
through
the
air
.
    
<EOS>
As
this
pair
of
penitents
walked
up
stairs
to
the
summer
-
house
,
the
patron
,
in
an
extasy
of
faith
,
pronounced
,
"
After
this
tremendous
scene
,
who
can
be
so
incredulous
,
so
dead
to
all
conviction
,
as
to
doubt
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
,
or
the
amazing
circumstances
that
attended
the
conversion
of
St
Paul
?
"
    
<EOS>
While
they
were
employed
in
the
exercise
of
their
devotion
,
our
hero
and
his
attendant
retired
by
the
back
-
door
,
which
opened
into
the
fields
;
and
while
Pipes
went
in
pursuit
of
his
calf
,
which
had
taken
shelter
under
the
wall
,
his
master
proceeded
forwards
to
the
place
from
whence
he
had
come
,
where
he
had
agreed
to
meet
Cadwallader
,
and
communicate
the
success
of
his
enterprize
,
with
which
he
was
perfectly
well
pleased
.
<EOS>
In
crossing
the
field
that
lay
betwixt
him
and
that
part
of
the
town
for
which
he
was
bound
,
he
chanced
to
pass
by
a
heap
of
wood
,
upon
which
he
perceived
a
woman
,
tolerably
well
dressed
,
sitting
,
and
holding
a
smelling
-
bottle
to
her
nose
.
<EOS>
He
immediately
guessed
her
to
be
the
lady
whom
he
had
interrupted
in
her
assignation
;
and
thinking
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
some
atonement
for
the
injury
he
had
done
,
he
accosted
her
with
great
politeness
and
respect
,
telling
her
,
he
presumed
,
from
her
being
in
such
a
solitary
place
,
at
such
an
hour
,
that
she
had
met
with
some
misfortune
;
and
that
,
if
she
would
put
herself
under
his
protection
,
he
would
defend
her
from
any
farther
insult
.
    
<EOS>
His
conjecture
was
right
;
this
was
the
individual
inamorata
who
had
fled
from
the
garden
,
and
who
was
so
terrified
at
the
vision
,
<EOS>
the
meaning
of
which
she
could
not
comprehend
,
that
she
found
herself
unable
to
proceed
farther
homewards
,
and
sat
down
on
a
log
of
wood
,
to
enjoy
a
little
pause
of
rest
,
and
endeavour
to
recollect
her
dissipated
spirits
.
<EOS>
She
had
not
yet
got
the
better
of
her
apprehension
,
which
was
rather
increased
by
the
darkness
of
the
night
and
the
loneliness
of
the
place
;
so
that
she
,
without
scruple
,
embraced
the
offer
of
a
person
who
behaved
with
such
gentle
address
:
and
as
she
was
enervated
by
fear
,
he
carefully
supported
her
in
walking
,
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
,
encouraging
her
all
the
way
with
assurances
of
safety
,
and
expressing
his
curiosity
to
know
the
adventure
,
in
consequence
of
which
she
had
occasion
for
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
She
spoke
very
little
during
her
passage
through
the
field
,
because
,
notwithstanding
his
professions
and
appearance
,
he
was
still
a
stranger
;
and
therefore
she
could
not
be
altogether
easy
,
while
she
thought
herself
absolutely
in
his
power
:
<EOS>
but
,
when
they
entered
the
town
,
and
mingled
with
the
concourse
of
people
that
pass
and
repass
through
all
the
streets
of
this
metropolis
,
her
diffidence
intirely
vanished
,
and
her
conversation
became
altogether
unreserved
.
    
<EOS>
The
remembrance
of
what
had
discomposed
her
so
much
in
the
garden
,
now
afforded
subject
for
her
mirth
;
and
when
her
conductor
still
repeated
his
desire
of
information
,
she
could
not
help
laughing
heartily
,
at
the
circumstances
which
his
questions
recalled
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
manifestation
of
good
humour
,
he
observed
,
that
as
her
spirits
were
exhausted
by
the
fatigue
and
disquiet
<EOS>
she
had
undergone
,
it
would
be
impossible
for
her
to
walk
much
farther
,
and
begg'd
she
would
step
with
him
into
the
next
tavern
,
where
they
might
send
for
an
hackney
-
coach
or
chair
,
in
which
she
would
be
conveyed
to
her
own
lodging
.
<EOS>
After
much
intreaty
,
she
consented
to
his
proposal
;
and
he
had
the
pleasure
to
see
,
that
she
was
a
very
handsome
young
woman
,
about
the
age
of
eighteen
.
    
<EOS>
The
joy
he
felt
at
this
discovery
lightened
in
his
eyes
;
nor
was
she
able
to
conceal
a
certain
alacrity
and
satisfaction
that
appeared
in
her
countenance
,
when
she
obtained
a
distinct
view
of
her
protector
's
person
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
was
prevailed
upon
to
drink
a
glass
of
wine
;
and
Peregrine
presuming
upon
his
knowledge
of
her
adventure
,
began
to
make
love
with
great
vehemence
.
    
<EOS>
At
first
,
she
pretended
to
take
offence
at
his
presumption
;
but
,
perceiving
from
certain
insinuations
which
he
artfully
dropp'd
,
that
he
was
better
acquainted
with
her
character
than
she
had
imagined
,
her
shyness
gradually
wore
off
,
and
they
soon
came
to
a
satisfactory
explanation
;
in
the
beginning
of
which
,
he
frankly
unravelled
the
whole
mystery
of
the
apparition
:
a
discovery
which
had
almost
proved
fatal
to
her
,
from
the
violence
of
mirth
it
produced
;
and
she
as
candidly
disclosed
her
own
private
history
.
<EOS>
She
told
him
,
that
her
lover
's
honourable
agent
had
formerly
lived
in
the
house
of
her
mother
,
who
being
a
poor
widow
,
supported
her
family
by
letting
lodgings
;
that
he
had
,
by
the
opportunities
of
familiarity
and
friendship
,
employed
his
arts
upon
her
,
and
actually
debauched
this
girl
,
when
she
was
no
more
than
fifteen
years
of
age
;
that
upon
the
remonstrances
of
her
mother
,
who
detected
their
correspondence
,
by
perceiving
she
was
with
child
,
he
had
quitted
the
house
,
with
an
absolute
refusal
to
provide
for
her
;
so
that
she
was
obliged
to
sue
him
for
the
maintenance
of
the
infant
,
and
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
receiving
gallants
in
private
;
though
she
had
always
managed
her
occupation
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
preserve
her
character
unsuspected
in
the
neighbourhood
:
and
lastly
,
that
her
first
seducer
had
lately
renewed
his
correspondence
,
by
dint
of
presents
and
apologies
,
and
procured
her
as
a
virgin
for
his
patron
,
who
had
promised
to
settle
some
small
provision
upon
her
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
comforted
her
for
her
disappointment
,
by
reciting
what
he
had
overheard
of
the
conversation
that
passed
in
the
garden
,
after
she
made
her
elopement
;
from
whence
he
inferred
,
that
her
interest
would
suffer
no
prejudice
from
that
interruption
;
because
,
in
all
probability
,
her
intended
lover
's
flesh
would
soon
get
the
better
of
the
spirit
again
,
in
spite
of
a
thousand
apparitions
;
in
which
case
,
he
would
again
have
recourse
to
her
compliance
;
or
,
should
his
superstition
prevail
,
he
would
look
upon
himself
as
in
duty
and
conscience
bound
,
to
enable
her
,
by
a
suitable
settlement
,
to
withstand
such
temptations
for
the
future
.
    
<EOS>
She
seemed
to
concur
with
his
opinion
,
and
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
that
expectation
,
while
our
hero
was
more
and
more
engaged
by
her
easy
and
agreeable
deportment
.
<EOS>
Her
conversation
was
that
of
a
gay
libertine
,
who
had
a
good
share
of
sense
and
imagination
,
which
,
with
a
natural
vivacity
,
she
employed
in
accommodating
herself
to
the
humour
of
her
gallant
:
but
his
ears
were
not
disgusted
with
the
nauseous
ribaldry
and
vulgar
-
execrations
which
characterise
the
discourse
of
those
nymphs
,
whose
temporary
endearments
are
solicited
by
the
distinguishing
youth
of
this
refined
age
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
this
accidental
meeting
was
productive
of
very
agreeable
consequences
to
both
;
and
an
intimacy
of
intercourse
immediately
commenced
,
the
result
of
which
was
,
her
promising
to
reserve
her
favours
for
him
alone
,
till
farther
notice
,
and
to
enter
into
no
measures
with
the
visionary
,
but
such
as
he
should
know
and
approve
.
    
<EOS>
Having
passed
the
evening
with
this
new
acquaintance
,
and
informed
himself
of
the
particulars
necessary
to
be
known
,
for
the
support
of
the
correspondence
they
had
established
,
he
favoured
her
with
some
marks
of
his
bounty
,
and
repaired
to
the
lodgings
of
his
friend
Crabtree
,
who
was
so
much
incensed
at
his
breach
of
punctuality
,
that
he
ordered
himself
to
be
denied
;
and
when
the
young
gentleman
forced
his
entrance
into
his
chamber
,
vi
&
armis
,
would
not
open
his
mouth
;
but
assuming
the
most
grim
contraction
of
his
countenance
,
sat
in
sullen
silence
,
till
the
circumstances
of
the
adventure
,
which
his
associate
knew
how
to
relate
to
the
greatest
advantage
,
gradually
unbended
his
features
to
an
involuntary
smile
,
which
soon
dilated
into
an
unrestrained
laugh
,
assuring
Peregrine
of
his
forgiveness
and
approbation
:
for
though
(
as
I
have
already
observed
)
<EOS>
this
Misanthrope
had
gained
an
absolute
ascendency
over
the
muscles
of
his
face
,
and
,
when
under
the
eye
of
the
world
,
could
laugh
inwardly
,
without
betraying
the
least
symptom
of
mirth
,
this
self
-
denial
was
not
exerted
without
pains
;
and
therefore
he
,
in
private
,
indemnified
himself
for
the
trouble
he
was
at
,
in
preserving
that
inflexible
gravity
in
public
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
in
the
evening
,
our
adventurer
visited
his
fair
Phillis
,
and
understood
that
she
had
a
message
from
the
new
convert
,
exhorting
her
to
repentance
and
reformation
,
and
promising
to
support
her
in
her
laudable
endeavours
,
as
soon
as
she
should
be
disposed
to
begin
the
great
work
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
his
trusty
messenger
had
talked
of
his
patron
's
conversion
in
the
most
ludicrous
terms
,
accounted
for
the
apparition
,
by
affirming
,
that
it
was
no
other
than
a
dog
,
with
a
paper
-
lanthorn
hanging
to
his
neck
,
equipped
in
that
manner
by
some
prentices
for
their
diversion
;
that
he
had
been
thrown
over
the
wall
,
with
a
view
to
frighten
the
servants
of
the
family
;
and
not
liking
his
quarters
,
no
sooner
perceived
the
garden
-
door
opened
,
than
he
naturally
ran
towards
it
,
in
order
to
make
his
escape
.
    
<EOS>
He
likewise
wise
<EOS>
frankly
owned
,
that
he
had
,
with
a
view
to
his
own
interest
,
encouraged
his
lord
and
master
in
his
superstitious
fears
,
and
even
counselled
him
to
execute
,
in
the
course
of
his
penitence
,
a
plan
which
he
had
formerly
laid
,
of
commencing
author
,
and
espousing
in
print
the
cause
of
miracles
,
against
the
children
of
perverseness
and
incredulity
:
and
in
conclusion
,
this
faithful
adviser
had
made
strong
love
on
his
own
score
,
proposing
to
maintain
a
correspondence
with
her
,
for
which
she
would
be
amply
recompenced
by
the
bounty
of
his
patron
,
whom
he
undertook
to
deceive
with
a
feigned
account
of
her
repentance
.
    
<EOS>
The
wench
,
having
an
aversion
to
the
character
of
this
parasite
,
whom
she
had
too
great
reason
to
know
,
instead
of
embracing
his
proposal
with
chearfulness
and
alacrity
,
told
him
with
an
affected
air
of
severity
,
that
howsoever
his
heart
might
be
hardened
against
the
warnings
of
heaven
,
she
had
the
internal
comfort
to
find
her
own
breast
touched
with
a
due
sense
of
her
unworthiness
,
and
would
,
by
the
blessing
of
providence
,
imitate
the
salutary
example
of
his
good
friend
,
to
whom
she
intended
to
write
an
account
of
her
inward
workings
,
which
she
hoped
were
no
other
than
the
motions
of
the
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Mercury
hearing
this
unexpected
declaration
,
which
was
delivered
with
a
face
of
pious
resolution
,
immediately
availed
himself
of
that
hypocrisy
,
which
he
possessed
to
such
a
consummate
degree
;
and
after
having
protested
with
great
earnestness
,
that
what
he
had
said
,
was
uttered
with
a
view
to
try
whether
or
not
she
was
intirely
mortified
to
all
the
lusts
of
the
flesh
,
he
applauded
her
determination
with
the
most
lofty
encomiums
,
and
admonished
her
to
perseverance
,
in
an
enthusiastic
harangue
;
during
which
,
the
tears
actually
gushed
from
his
eyes
,
and
his
looks
adopted
a
sort
of
wildness
and
extatic
stare
,
as
if
he
had
been
really
transported
.
    
<EOS>
Though
she
saw
through
the
disguise
,
she
seemed
convinced
of
his
sincerity
;
as
a
confirmation
of
which
,
he
gave
her
his
purse
,
and
took
his
leave
,
assuring
her
that
she
should
never
want
,
so
long
as
she
could
retain
grace
enough
to
persist
in
the
happy
work
she
had
so
righteously
begun
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
approved
of
her
behaviour
,
and
having
instructed
her
with
regard
to
her
future
conduct
,
returned
to
his
auxiliary
and
intelligencer
,
with
whom
he
concerted
another
stratagem
,
to
be
practised
upon
a
certain
she
-
gamester
of
fashion
,
and
a
French
adventurer
,
who
,
under
the
title
of
count
,
supported
with
invincible
effrontery
,
and
a
large
stock
of
finesse
,
had
found
means
to
introduce
himself
among
the
quality
,
from
many
of
whom
he
had
extracted
large
sums
of
money
at
play
.
<EOS>
Among
those
whom
he
laid
under
contribution
,
was
this
lady
,
who
with
all
the
inclination
of
a
rank
sharper
,
had
fallen
a
sacrifice
to
his
superior
talents
,
and
become
his
debtor
for
five
hundred
pounds
,
which
she
could
not
pay
without
the
assistance
of
her
husband
,
whom
she
did
not
think
proper
to
inform
of
the
loss
.
<EOS>
She
had
for
some
days
evaded
the
demands
of
her
creditor
,
by
divers
specious
pretences
,
which
,
however
,
were
soon
exhausted
;
and
he
grew
so
disagreeably
importunate
,
as
to
threaten
an
application
to
her
lord
,
if
she
would
not
discharge
the
debt
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
The
lady
being
a
latitudinarian
in
her
principles
,
and
reduced
to
great
perplexity
by
these
menaces
,
could
think
of
no
other
expedient
to
extricate
herself
,
than
that
of
practising
upon
the
foreigner
's
heart
,
which
she
accordingly
assailed
with
all
the
arts
of
coquetry
,
reinforced
by
a
very
agreeable
person
,
to
which
she
had
been
often
indebted
for
sundry
fortunate
events
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
in
all
probability
she
would
have
found
the
count
impregnable
,
had
not
he
,
at
this
crisis
,
luckily
met
with
such
a
flow
of
success
,
as
elevated
his
fancy
,
and
opened
his
heart
to
amorous
impressions
.
<EOS>
In
this
state
of
exultation
did
he
first
perceive
,
or
at
least
acknowledge
the
attractions
of
his
debtor
,
to
whom
he
,
in
a
billet
,
declared
his
passion
,
and
frankly
proposed
the
alternative
,
which
it
was
her
sole
aim
to
procure
.
    
<EOS>
After
the
necessary
scruples
of
decent
reluctance
,
the
affair
was
compromised
,
in
the
hearing
of
Cadwallader
,
who
reported
to
his
associate
,
that
she
had
given
the
count
an
assignation
at
the
house
of
a
discreet
matron
,
who
,
under
the
denomination
of
a
milliner
,
kept
commodious
apartments
for
interviews
of
this
kind
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
not
unknown
to
this
priestess
of
love
,
no
sooner
received
this
intelligence
,
than
he
went
and
bespoke
one
of
her
chambers
,
contiguous
to
that
which
the
foreigner
had
chosen
for
his
accommodation
;
and
some
time
before
the
hour
of
their
appointment
,
took
possession
of
it
,
accompanied
by
Crabtree
,
whom
he
had
dressed
in
woman
's
apparel
,
because
the
Misanthrope
would
not
run
the
risque
of
being
observed
in
propria
persona
.
    
<EOS>
The
lovers
,
true
to
their
contract
,
met
precisely
at
the
hour
;
the
lady
having
disguised
herself
in
an
ordinary
dishabille
,
with
a
capuchin
,
the
hood
of
which
effectually
concealed
her
countenance
;
and
the
door
of
their
apartment
being
shut
,
the
count
found
himself
on
the
brink
of
enjoying
his
good
fortune
,
when
all
of
a
sudden
,
Peregrine
,
placing
himself
at
the
door
,
pronounced
aloud
,
in
the
very
voice
and
manner
of
her
lord
,
whom
he
personally
knew
,
"
Stand
firm
upon
your
post
,
Mr
Constable
,
and
take
care
that
none
shall
pass
,
while
I
break
open
the
door
,
and
make
sure
of
the
delinquent
;
for
now
I
think
her
ladyship
is
fairly
caught
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
exclamation
produced
an
instantaneous
effect
in
the
chamber
:
the
count
,
terrified
at
the
prospect
of
immediate
death
or
prosecution
,
ran
directly
to
the
window
,
and
throwing
up
the
sash
,
would
have
made
his
exit
into
the
street
,
without
ceremony
;
but
my
lady
,
who
never
doubted
that
her
husband
was
at
the
door
,
had
recourse
to
that
presence
of
mind
,
which
never
forsook
her
upon
such
occasions
;
and
seizing
her
gallant
by
the
collar
,
exalted
her
voice
,
crying
,
"
Rape
!
<EOS>
Murder
!
<EOS>
Rape
!
<EOS>
Ah
villain
!
<EOS>
do
you
attempt
my
virtue
?
<EOS>
Are
these
the
laces
you
invited
me
to
come
and
see
?
<EOS>
Ah
,
you
beastly
monster
!
<EOS>
Help
,
good
people
,
help
!
"
    
<EOS>
The
noise
of
these
outcries
,
(
in
consequence
of
which
Pickle
immediately
retreated
to
his
den
)
alarmed
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
The
landlady
,
whose
reputation
was
at
stake
,
ran
up
stairs
,
accompanied
by
two
chairmen
,
who
waited
for
my
lady
below
;
and
the
door
being
burst
open
by
her
directions
,
they
found
her
ladyship
in
a
violent
agitation
,
holding
fast
by
the
count
,
who
stood
without
his
perriwig
,
shaking
from
head
to
foot
,
in
all
the
agony
of
horror
and
dismay
.
    
<EOS>
My
lady
,
finding
herself
delivered
from
the
attempts
of
this
ravisher
,
sunk
down
upon
the
couch
in
a
swoon
;
and
while
the
matron
of
the
house
administered
to
her
nostrils
,
the
chairmen
secured
the
poor
gallant
,
whose
faculties
were
actually
suppressed
by
the
extasy
of
his
fear
.
    
<EOS>
The
lady
having
a
little
recollected
her
spirits
,
and
looking
around
,
without
perceiving
her
husband
,
concluded
that
he
was
satisfied
of
her
innocence
,
by
the
artifice
of
her
behaviour
,
and
omitted
to
shew
himself
,
that
she
might
not
be
shocked
at
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
On
this
supposition
,
she
renewed
her
clamour
against
the
count
,
whom
she
reviled
with
the
epithets
of
perfidious
wretch
,
and
abominable
ruffian
;
and
expressed
her
doubts
about
the
honesty
of
the
house
,
to
which
(
she
said
)
<EOS>
he
had
decoyed
her
,
on
pretence
of
shewing
some
laces
of
a
new
pattern
,
that
the
milliner
had
received
from
abroad
.
    
<EOS>
The
landlady
was
no
stranger
to
her
person
or
character
,
and
therefore
had
never
doubted
the
truth
of
the
count
's
information
,
when
he
made
her
privy
to
the
nature
of
this
interview
;
but
her
ladyship
's
present
behaviour
,
(
the
true
cause
of
which
she
did
not
know
)
intirely
altered
her
opinion
;
and
she
now
believed
,
that
the
count
intended
to
have
made
her
house
the
scene
of
a
rape
in
good
earnest
.
<EOS>
This
suggestion
divested
her
of
all
regard
for
her
customer
,
against
whom
she
exclaimed
with
great
virulence
,
as
a
person
who
had
endeavoured
to
intail
the
curse
of
infamy
upon
her
house
;
and
assured
the
plaintiff
,
that
he
had
hired
the
apartment
for
a
young
lady
,
whom
he
pretended
to
have
privately
espoused
,
without
the
consent
of
her
parents
,
from
whose
inquiries
he
had
reasons
to
conceal
the
place
of
her
abode
.
    
<EOS>
The
rueful
foreigner
,
baited
with
their
joint
invectives
,
and
more
than
half
distracted
with
the
terrors
of
an
English
jury
,
never
dream'd
of
attempting
to
vindicate
himself
from
the
imputation
he
had
incurred
;
because
he
imagined
the
whole
affair
was
the
result
of
a
conspiracy
against
his
life
and
fortune
;
but
falling
upon
his
knees
before
his
accuser
,
in
the
most
suppliant
manner
,
implored
her
pardon
,
which
he
offered
to
acknowledge
by
a
present
of
a
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Had
these
terms
been
seasonably
proposed
,
matters
would
soon
have
been
brought
to
an
accommodation
;
but
she
could
not
decently
enter
into
a
treaty
with
him
,
in
presence
of
such
witnesses
;
and
besides
,
she
believed
herself
still
under
the
inspection
of
her
husband
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
rejected
his
proffer
with
disdain
,
observing
,
that
his
guilt
was
of
such
a
nature
,
as
to
preclude
all
hopes
of
forgiveness
;
and
ordered
the
chairmen
to
take
charge
of
his
person
,
until
he
should
be
taken
into
custody
by
an
officer
properly
authorized
.
    
<EOS>
Having
given
these
directions
,
at
which
the
poor
prisoner
wrung
his
hands
in
horror
and
despair
,
she
withdrew
with
the
matron
into
another
room
,
in
expectation
of
being
visited
by
her
husband
;
and
after
having
waited
some
time
with
manifest
impatience
,
could
not
forbear
asking
if
there
were
any
other
lodgers
in
the
house
:
when
the
landlady
replied
in
the
negative
,
she
began
to
sift
her
with
a
variety
of
questions
,
in
the
course
of
which
she
learn'd
,
that
not
a
soul
had
entered
the
house
after
her
own
arrival
;
and
then
conjectured
,
that
the
voice
she
had
mistaken
for
her
husband
's
,
must
have
been
part
of
a
conversation
that
passed
in
the
next
house
,
from
which
she
was
separated
by
a
thin
party
-
wall
.
    
<EOS>
This
discovery
mortified
her
in
one
respect
,
and
pleased
her
in
another
;
she
was
chagrined
at
the
disagreeable
interruption
,
because
it
laid
her
under
the
necessity
of
exposing
her
character
to
the
inquiries
of
those
whom
her
cries
had
brought
to
her
assistance
;
though
she
was
at
the
same
time
very
well
satisfied
to
find
that
her
lord
was
ignorant
of
the
adventure
,
and
that
it
was
now
in
her
power
to
be
revenged
upon
the
count
,
for
the
severity
of
his
behaviour
,
when
he
acted
in
the
capacity
of
her
creditor
.
<EOS>
She
therefore
resolved
to
extort
a
sum
of
money
from
him
,
by
way
of
composition
;
and
,
under
pretence
of
hushing
up
an
affair
,
which
might
(
otherwise
)
give
scandal
an
opportunity
to
be
free
with
her
reputation
,
signified
to
her
hostess
,
a
desire
of
seeing
matters
compromised
.
    
<EOS>
The
prudent
milliner
applauded
her
moderation
,
by
which
she
foresaw
that
her
own
character
would
escape
censure
;
and
being
favoured
with
her
ladyship
's
confidence
,
went
out
immediately
,
in
order
to
communicate
her
proposals
to
the
prisoner
;
but
while
these
deliberations
were
upon
the
carpet
,
he
had
employed
his
rhetoric
so
successfully
upon
his
guard
,
that
they
were
prevailed
upon
to
set
him
at
liberty
,
and
make
their
own
retreat
,
at
the
same
time
.
<EOS>
So
that
her
ladyship
's
scheme
proved
abortive
,
and
she
was
fain
to
retire
to
her
own
house
,
meditating
further
vengeance
upon
the
fugitive
,
who
did
not
think
proper
to
stand
the
brunt
of
her
indignation
;
but
decamped
that
night
for
his
native
country
,
in
which
he
happily
secured
his
retreat
,
fully
persuaded
,
that
his
ruin
had
been
planned
by
a
powerful
confederacy
in
England
,
of
which
my
lady
was
the
chief
instrument
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
our
young
gentleman
and
his
tutor
enjoyed
the
consternation
and
perplexity
which
they
had
produced
,
as
an
wholesome
chastisement
bestowed
upon
a
profligate
virago
,
lost
to
all
sense
of
oeconomy
and
decorum
,
and
a
just
punishment
inflicted
upon
an
infamous
adventurer
,
who
not
only
pillaged
,
but
also
disgraced
the
company
by
whom
he
was
caressed
.
<EOS>
It
was
in
consequence
of
this
adventure
,
that
Peregrine
conceived
a
very
ludicrous
project
,
the
execution
of
which
furnished
entertainment
and
admiration
to
all
the
fashionable
people
in
town
.
<EOS>
The
appearance
of
Cadwallader
in
a
female
dress
,
was
so
uncouth
and
preternatural
,
that
the
good
milliner
,
who
chanced
to
be
favoured
with
a
glimpse
of
him
,
as
he
went
up
stairs
with
his
supposed
gallant
,
was
not
only
astonished
,
but
affrighted
at
the
peculiarity
of
his
countenance
;
and
notwithstanding
her
well
-
tried
discretion
,
which
had
never
permitted
her
curiosity
to
exceed
the
bounds
of
complaisance
,
she
could
not
forbear
calling
her
son
Pickle
into
another
room
,
after
her
ladyship
's
retreat
;
and
asking
with
manifest
marks
of
confusion
and
disquiet
,
if
the
person
whom
he
had
brought
into
her
house
,
was
really
and
bona
fide
a
woman
and
a
christian
;
at
the
same
time
,
expressing
her
suspicion
,
from
the
disposition
of
his
companion
's
wrinkles
,
and
the
bristles
that
appeared
upon
her
chin
,
that
she
was
no
better
than
a
witch
or
a
conjurer
,
whom
he
had
employed
to
embroil
and
expose
her
customers
by
the
art
of
sorcery
,
for
which
she
prayed
God
would
forgive
him
.
    
<EOS>
"
Certain
I
am
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
the
count
and
my
lady
went
into
the
chamber
with
the
disposition
of
two
lambs
,
and
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
(
Lord
have
mercy
upon
us
!
)
<EOS>
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
but
discord
and
desperation
!
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
,
Mr
Pickle
!
<EOS>
it
was
for
no
charitable
end
,
that
you
was
so
anxious
to
occupy
the
next
room
.
<EOS>
I
thought
there
was
something
unnatural
in
the
case
,
when
I
saw
you
lead
up
that
old
beldame
with
the
beard
.
<EOS>
You
have
ruined
the
reputation
of
my
house
,
Mr
Pickle
.
<EOS>
My
good
friends
the
countess
of
Peppermarsh
,
lady
Tickletoe
,
and
Mrs
Riggle
,
will
never
enter
my
doors
again
.
<EOS>
I
shall
be
deprived
of
getting
an
honest
livelihood
;
and
all
by
the
cruelty
of
one
that
I
loved
as
well
as
if
I
had
been
the
mother
that
bore
him
.
<EOS>
O
that
<EOS>
ever
I
was
born
to
see
this
unlucky
day
!
<EOS>
"
These
words
she
accompanied
with
sundry
sobs
,
and
a
few
extempore
tears
,
the
nature
of
which
he
perfectly
understood
;
and
therefore
prescribed
a
cordial
which
in
a
moment
set
her
heart
at
ease
.
    
Chapter
XC
He
persuades
Cadwallader
to
assume
the
character
of
a
magician
,
in
which
he
acquires
a
great
share
of
reputation
,
by
his
responses
to
three
females
of
distinction
,
who
severally
consult
the
researches
of
his
art
.
   
<EOS>
Her
suspicion
of
his
associate
,
while
it
afforded
him
subject
for
mirth
,
struck
his
imagination
with
an
idea
which
he
could
not
help
indulging
;
and
when
he
communicated
the
conceit
to
Cadwallader
,
it
in
a
moment
acquired
his
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
This
notion
he
imparted
in
a
proposal
,
to
subject
the
town
to
their
ridicule
,
by
giving
responses
in
the
character
of
a
professed
conjurer
,
to
be
personated
by
the
old
Misanthrope
,
whose
aspect
was
extremely
well
calculated
for
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
The
plan
was
immediately
adjusted
in
all
its
parts
;
an
apartment
hired
in
an
house
accommodated
with
a
public
stair
;
so
that
people
might
have
free
ingress
and
egress
,
without
being
exposed
to
observation
;
and
this
tenement
being
furnished
with
the
apparatus
of
a
magician
,
such
as
globes
,
telescopes
,
a
magic
lanthorn
,
a
skeleton
,
a
dried
monkey
,
together
with
the
skins
of
an
alligator
,
otter
and
snake
,
the
conjurer
himself
took
possession
of
his
castle
,
after
having
distributed
printed
advertisements
,
containing
the
particulars
of
his
undertaking
.
    
<EOS>
These
bills
soon
operated
according
to
the
wish
of
the
projectors
.
<EOS>
As
the
price
of
the
oracle
was
fixed
at
half
a
guinea
,
the
public
naturally
concluded
,
that
the
author
was
no
common
fortune
-
teller
;
and
the
very
next
day
,
Peregrine
found
some
ladies
of
his
quality
-
acquaintance
,
infected
with
the
desire
of
making
an
experiment
upon
the
skill
of
this
new
conjurer
,
who
pretended
to
be
just
arrived
from
the
Mogul
's
empire
,
where
he
had
learned
the
art
from
a
Brachman
philosopher
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
affected
to
talk
of
the
pretensions
of
this
sage
with
ridicule
and
contempt
,
and
with
seeming
reluctance
,
undertook
to
attend
them
to
his
apartment
,
observing
,
that
it
would
be
a
very
easy
matter
to
detect
the
fellow
's
ignorance
,
and
no
more
than
common
justice
to
chastise
him
for
his
presumption
.
    
<EOS>
Though
he
could
easily
perceive
a
great
fund
of
credulity
in
the
company
,
they
affected
to
espouse
his
opinion
,
and
under
the
notion
of
a
frolic
,
agreed
,
that
one
particular
lady
should
endeavour
to
baffle
his
art
,
by
appearing
before
him
in
the
dress
of
her
woman
,
who
should
,
at
the
same
time
,
personate
her
mistress
,
and
be
treated
as
such
by
our
adventurer
,
who
promised
to
squire
them
to
the
place
.
<EOS>
These
measures
being
concerted
,
and
the
appointment
fixed
for
the
next
audience
-
day
,
Peregrine
furnished
his
friend
with
the
necessary
information
;
and
when
the
hour
of
assignation
arrived
,
conducted
his
charge
to
this
oraculous
seer
.
    
<EOS>
They
were
admitted
by
our
hero
's
valet
de
chambre
,
whose
visage
being
naturally
meagre
and
swarthy
,
was
adorned
with
artificial
whiskers
;
so
that
he
became
the
Persian
dress
which
he
wore
,
and
seemed
a
very
proper
master
of
the
ceremonies
to
an
oriental
Necromancer
.
<EOS>
Having
crossed
his
arms
upon
his
breast
,
with
an
inclination
of
the
head
,
he
stalked
in
solemn
silence
before
them
into
the
Penetralia
of
the
temple
,
where
they
found
the
conjurer
sitting
at
a
table
,
provided
with
pen
,
ink
and
paper
,
divers
books
and
mathematical
instruments
,
and
a
long
white
wand
lying
across
the
whole
.
<EOS>
He
was
habited
in
a
black
gown
and
fur
-
cap
,
and
his
countenance
,
over
and
above
a
double
proportion
of
philosophic
gravity
which
he
had
assumed
for
the
occasion
,
was
improved
by
a
thick
beard
white
as
snow
,
that
reached
to
his
middle
,
and
upon
each
shoulder
sat
a
prodigious
large
black
cat
which
had
been
tutored
for
the
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
figure
,
which
would
have
startled
Peregrine
himself
,
had
not
he
been
concerned
in
the
mystery
,
could
not
fail
to
make
an
impression
upon
those
whom
he
accompanied
.
    
<EOS>
The
fictitious
chambermaid
,
in
spite
of
all
her
natural
pertness
and
vivacity
,
changed
colour
when
she
entered
the
room
,
and
the
pretended
lady
,
whose
intellects
were
not
quite
so
enlightened
,
began
to
tremble
in
every
joint
,
and
ejaculate
petitions
to
heaven
for
her
safety
.
<EOS>
Their
conductor
advancing
to
the
table
,
presented
his
offering
,
and
pointing
to
the
suivante
,
told
him
,
that
lady
desired
to
know
what
would
be
her
destiny
in
point
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
The
philosopher
,
without
lifting
up
his
eyes
to
view
the
person
in
whose
behalf
he
was
consulted
,
turned
his
ear
to
one
of
the
sable
familiars
that
purred
upon
his
shoulder
,
and
taking
up
the
pen
,
wrote
upon
a
detached
slip
of
paper
these
words
,
which
Peregrine
,
at
the
desire
of
the
ladies
,
repeated
aloud
,
"
Her
destiny
will
,
in
a
great
measure
,
depend
upon
what
happened
to
her
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
on
the
third
day
of
last
December
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
sentence
was
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
the
counterfeit
lady
uttered
a
fearful
scream
,
and
ran
out
into
the
antichamber
,
exclaiming
,
"
Christ
have
mercy
upon
us
!
<EOS>
Sure
he
is
the
devil
incarnate
!
"
<EOS>
Her
mistress
,
who
followed
her
with
great
consternation
,
insisted
upon
knowing
the
transaction
to
which
the
response
alluded
;
and
Mrs
Abigail
,
after
some
recollection
,
gave
her
to
understand
,
that
she
had
an
admirer
,
who
,
on
the
very
hour
and
day
mentioned
by
the
cunning
man
,
had
addressed
himself
to
her
in
a
serious
proposal
of
marriage
.
<EOS>
This
explanation
,
however
,
was
more
ingenious
than
candid
;
for
the
admirer
was
no
other
than
the
identical
Mr
Pickle
himself
,
who
was
a
meer
dragon
among
the
chambermaids
,
and
,
in
his
previous
information
communicated
to
his
associate
,
<EOS>
had
given
an
account
of
this
assignation
,
with
which
he
had
been
favoured
by
the
damsel
in
question
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
seeing
his
company
very
much
affected
with
this
circumstance
of
the
wizzard
's
art
,
which
had
almost
frighted
both
mistress
and
maid
into
hysteric
fits
,
pretended
to
laugh
them
out
of
their
fears
,
by
observing
that
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
this
instance
of
his
knowledge
,
which
might
have
been
acquired
by
some
of
those
secret
emissaries
whom
such
impostors
are
obliged
to
employ
for
intelligence
,
or
imparted
by
the
lover
himself
,
who
had
,
perhaps
,
come
to
consult
him
about
the
success
of
his
amour
.
<EOS>
Encouraged
by
this
observation
,
or
rather
prompted
by
an
insatiable
curiosity
,
which
was
proof
against
all
sort
of
apprehension
,
the
disguised
lady
returned
to
the
magician
's
own
apartment
,
and
assuming
the
air
of
a
pert
chambermaid
,
"
Mr
Conjurer
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
now
you
have
satisfied
my
mistress
,
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
,
if
ever
I
shall
be
married
?
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
sage
,
without
the
least
hesitation
,
favoured
her
with
an
answer
,
in
the
following
words
:
"
You
can
not
be
married
before
you
are
a
widow
;
and
whether
or
not
that
will
ever
be
the
case
,
is
a
question
which
my
art
can
not
resolve
,
because
my
foreknowledge
exceeds
not
the
term
of
thirty
years
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
reply
,
which
at
once
cut
her
off
from
the
pleasing
prospect
of
seeing
herself
independent
in
the
enjoyment
of
youth
and
fortune
,
in
a
moment
clouded
her
aspect
;
all
her
good
humour
was
overcast
,
and
she
went
away
,
without
further
inquiry
,
muttering
,
in
the
rancour
of
her
chagrin
,
that
he
was
a
silly
impertinent
fellow
,
and
a
meer
quack
in
his
profession
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
the
prejudice
of
this
resentment
,
her
conviction
soon
recurred
;
and
when
the
report
of
his
answers
was
made
to
those
confederates
by
whom
she
had
been
deputed
to
make
trial
of
his
skill
,
they
were
universally
persuaded
that
his
art
was
altogether
supernatural
,
tho
'
each
affected
to
treat
it
with
contempt
,
resolving
,
in
her
own
breast
,
to
have
recourse
to
him
in
private
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
the
maid
,
tho
'
laid
under
the
most
peremptory
injunctions
of
secrecy
,
was
so
full
of
the
circumstance
which
related
to
her
own
conduct
,
that
she
extolled
his
prescience
,
in
whispers
to
all
her
acquaintance
,
assuring
them
,
that
he
had
told
her
all
the
particulars
of
her
life
;
so
that
his
fame
was
almost
instantaneously
conveyed
,
thro
'
a
thousand
different
channels
,
<EOS>
to
all
parts
of
the
town
;
and
the
very
next
time
he
assumed
the
chair
,
his
doors
were
besieged
by
curious
people
of
all
sects
and
denominations
.
    
<EOS>
Being
an
old
practitioner
in
this
art
,
Cadwallaner
knew
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
support
his
reputation
in
the
promiscuous
exercise
of
fortune
-
telling
,
because
every
person
that
should
come
to
consult
him
would
expect
a
sample
of
his
skill
,
relating
to
things
past
;
and
it
could
not
be
supposed
,
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
private
concerns
of
every
individual
who
might
apply
to
him
for
that
purpose
:
he
therefore
ordered
his
minister
,
whom
he
distinguished
by
the
name
of
Hadgi
Rourk
,
to
signify
to
all
those
who
demanded
entrance
,
that
his
price
was
half
a
guinea
;
and
that
all
such
as
were
not
disposed
to
gratify
him
with
that
consideration
would
do
well
to
leave
the
passage
free
for
the
rest
.
    
<EOS>
This
declaration
succeeded
to
his
wish
;
for
this
congregation
consisted
chiefly
of
footmen
,
chambermaids
,
prentices
,
and
the
lower
class
of
tradesmen
,
who
could
not
afford
to
purchase
prescience
at
such
a
price
;
so
that
,
after
fruitless
offers
of
shillings
and
half
crowns
,
they
dropped
off
one
by
one
,
and
left
the
field
open
for
customers
of
an
higher
rank
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
person
of
this
species
who
appeared
was
dressed
like
the
wife
of
a
substantial
tradesman
;
but
this
disguise
could
not
screen
her
from
the
penetration
of
the
conjurer
,
who
at
first
sight
knew
her
to
be
one
of
the
ladies
of
whose
coming
he
had
been
apprized
by
Peregrine
,
on
the
supposition
that
their
curiosity
was
rather
inflamed
than
allayed
by
the
intelligence
they
had
received
from
his
first
client
.
<EOS>
This
lady
approached
the
philosopher
with
that
intrepidity
of
countenance
so
conspicuous
in
matrons
of
her
dignified
sphere
,
and
in
a
soft
voice
,
asked
with
a
simper
,
of
what
complexion
her
next
child
would
be
?
<EOS>
The
necromancer
,
who
was
perfectly
well
acquainted
with
her
private
history
,
forthwith
delivered
his
response
in
the
following
question
,
written
in
the
usual
form
,
"
How
long
has
Pompey
the
black
been
dismissed
from
your
ladyship
's
service
?
"
    
<EOS>
Endued
<EOS>
as
she
was
with
a
great
share
of
that
fortitude
which
is
distinguished
by
the
appellation
of
effrontery
,
her
face
exhibited
some
signs
of
shame
and
confusion
at
the
receit
of
this
oracular
interrogation
,
by
which
she
was
convinced
of
his
extraordinary
intelligence
;
and
accosting
him
in
a
very
serious
tone
,
"
Doctor
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
you
are
a
person
of
great
abilities
in
the
art
you
profess
;
and
therefore
,
without
pretending
to
dissemble
,
I
will
own
you
have
touched
the
true
string
of
my
apprehensions
.
<EOS>
I
am
persuaded
I
need
not
be
more
particular
in
my
inquiries
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
purse
of
money
;
take
it
,
and
deliver
me
from
a
most
alarming
and
uneasy
suspence
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
deposited
her
offering
upon
the
table
,
and
waited
for
his
answer
with
a
face
of
fearful
expectation
,
while
he
was
employed
in
writing
this
sentence
for
her
perusal
:
"
Tho
'
I
see
into
the
womb
of
time
,
the
prospect
is
not
perfectly
distinct
;
the
seeds
of
future
events
lie
mingled
and
confused
:
so
that
I
am
under
the
necessity
of
assisting
my
divination
in
some
cases
,
by
analogy
and
human
intelligence
;
and
can
not
possibly
satisfy
your
present
doubts
,
unless
you
will
condescend
to
make
me
privy
to
all
those
occurrences
which
you
think
might
have
interfered
with
the
cause
of
your
apprehension
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
lady
having
read
the
declaration
,
affected
a
small
emotion
of
shyness
and
repugnance
,
and
seating
herself
upon
a
settee
,
after
having
cautiously
informed
herself
of
the
privacy
of
the
apartment
,
gave
such
a
detail
of
the
succession
of
her
lovers
,
as
amazed
while
it
entertained
the
necromancer
,
as
well
as
his
friend
Pickle
,
who
from
a
closet
in
which
he
had
concealed
himself
,
overheard
every
syllable
of
her
confession
.
<EOS>
Cadwallader
listened
to
her
story
with
a
look
of
infinite
importance
and
sagacity
,
and
after
a
short
pause
told
her
,
that
he
would
not
pretend
to
give
a
categorical
answer
,
until
he
should
have
deliberated
maturely
upon
the
various
circumstances
of
the
affair
;
but
if
she
would
take
the
trouble
of
honouring
him
with
another
visit
on
his
next
public
day
,
he
hoped
he
should
be
able
to
give
her
full
satisfaction
.
    
<EOS>
Conscious
of
the
importance
of
her
doubts
,
she
could
not
help
commending
his
caution
,
and
took
her
leave
,
with
a
promise
of
returning
at
the
appointed
time
;
then
the
conjurer
being
joined
by
his
associate
,
they
gave
a
loose
to
their
mirth
,
which
having
indulged
,
they
began
to
concert
measures
for
inflicting
some
disgraceful
punishment
on
the
shameless
and
insatiate
termagant
who
had
so
impudently
avowed
her
own
prostitution
.
    
<EOS>
They
were
interrupted
,
however
,
in
their
conference
,
by
the
arrival
of
a
new
guest
,
who
being
announced
by
Hadgi
<EOS>
,
our
hero
retreated
to
his
lurking
-
place
,
and
Cadwallader
resumed
his
mysterious
appearance
.
<EOS>
This
new
client
,
tho
'
she
hid
her
face
in
a
mask
,
could
not
conceal
herself
from
the
knowledge
of
the
conjurer
,
who
by
her
voice
recognized
her
to
be
an
unmarried
lady
of
his
own
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
She
had
,
within
a
small
compass
of
time
,
made
herself
remarkable
for
two
adventures
,
which
had
not
at
all
succeeded
to
her
expectation
:
being
very
much
addicted
to
play
,
she
had
,
at
a
certain
route
,
indulged
that
passion
to
such
excess
,
as
not
only
got
the
better
of
her
justice
,
but
also
of
her
circumspection
;
so
that
she
was
unfortunately
detected
in
her
endeavours
to
appropriate
to
herself
what
was
not
lawfully
her
due
.
<EOS>
This
small
slip
was
attended
with
another
indiscretion
,
which
had
likewise
an
unlucky
effect
upon
her
reputation
.
<EOS>
She
had
been
favoured
with
the
addresses
of
one
of
those
hopeful
heirs
who
swarm
and
swagger
about
town
,
under
the
denomination
of
Bucks
;
and
in
the
confidence
of
his
honour
consented
to
be
one
of
a
partie
that
made
an
excursion
as
far
as
Windsor
,
thinking
herself
secured
from
scandal
by
the
company
of
another
young
lady
,
who
had
also
condescended
to
trust
her
person
to
the
protection
of
her
admirer
.
    
<EOS>
The
two
gallants
,
in
the
course
of
this
expedition
,
were
said
to
use
the
most
perfidious
means
to
intoxicate
the
passions
of
their
mistresses
,
by
mixing
drugs
with
their
wine
,
which
inflamed
their
constitutions
to
such
a
degree
,
that
they
fell
an
easy
sacrifice
to
the
appetites
of
their
conductors
,
who
,
upon
their
return
to
town
,
were
so
base
and
inhuman
as
to
boast
among
their
companions
of
the
exploit
they
had
atchieved
.
<EOS>
Thus
the
story
was
circulated
,
with
a
thousand
additional
circumstances
to
the
prejudice
of
the
sufferers
,
one
of
whom
had
thought
proper
to
withdraw
into
the
country
,
until
the
scandal
raised
at
her
expence
should
subside
;
while
the
other
,
who
was
not
so
easily
put
out
of
countenance
,
resolved
to
outface
the
report
,
as
a
treacherous
aspersion
,
invented
by
her
lover
as
an
excuse
for
his
own
inconstancy
;
and
actually
appeared
in
public
,
as
usual
,
till
she
found
herself
neglected
by
the
greatest
part
of
her
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
disgrace
,
which
she
knew
not
whether
to
impute
to
the
card
affair
,
or
to
the
last
faux
pas
she
had
committed
,
she
now
came
to
consult
the
conjurer
,
and
signified
her
errand
,
by
asking
whether
the
cause
of
her
present
disquiet
was
of
the
town
or
country
?
<EOS>
Cadwallader
at
once
perceiving
her
allusion
,
answered
her
question
in
these
terms
.
<EOS>
"
This
honest
world
will
forgive
a
young
gamester
for
indiscretion
at
play
,
but
a
favour
granted
to
a
blabbing
coxcomb
is
an
unpardonable
offence
.
"
<EOS>
This
reponse
she
received
with
equal
astonishment
and
chagrin
;
and
,
fully
convinced
of
the
necromancer
's
omniscience
,
implored
his
advice
touching
the
retrieval
of
her
reputation
:
upon
which
he
counselled
her
to
we
d
with
the
first
opportunity
;
and
she
seemed
so
well
pleased
with
his
admonition
,
that
she
gratified
him
with
a
double
fee
,
and
dropping
a
low
curt'sy
,
retired
.
    
<EOS>
Our
undertakers
now
thought
it
high
time
to
silence
the
oracle
for
the
day
,
and
Hadgi
was
accordingly
ordered
to
exclude
all
comers
,
while
Peregrine
and
his
friend
renewed
the
deliberations
,
which
had
been
interrupted
,
and
settled
a
plan
of
operations
for
the
next
occasion
:
<EOS>
mean
while
it
was
resolved
,
that
Hadgi
should
not
only
exercise
his
own
talents
,
but
also
employ
inferior
agents
,
in
procuring
general
intelligence
for
the
support
of
their
scheme
;
that
the
expence
of
this
ministry
should
be
defrayed
from
the
profits
of
their
profession
;
and
the
remainder
be
distributed
to
poor
families
in
distress
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XCI
Peregrine
and
his
friend
Cadwallader
proceed
in
the
exercise
of
the
mystery
of
fortune
-
telling
,
in
the
course
of
which
they
atchieve
various
adventures
.
   
<EOS>
These
preliminaries
being
adjusted
,
our
hero
forthwith
repaired
to
a
card
assembly
,
which
was
frequented
by
some
of
the
most
notable
gossips
in
town
,
and
having
artfully
turned
the
conversation
upon
the
subject
of
the
fortune
-
teller
,
whose
talents
he
pretended
to
ridicule
,
incensed
their
itch
of
knowing
secrets
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
their
curiosity
became
flagrant
,
and
he
took
it
for
granted
,
that
all
or
some
of
them
would
visit
Albumazar
on
his
very
first
visiting
-
day
.
    
<EOS>
While
Peregrine
was
thus
engaged
,
his
associate
made
his
appearance
in
another
convocation
of
fashionable
people
,
where
he
soon
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
conjurer
brought
upon
the
carpet
by
an
elderly
gentlewoman
,
remarkable
for
her
inquisitive
disposition
,
who
addressing
herself
to
Cadwallader
,
asked
,
by
the
help
of
the
finger
-
alphabet
,
if
he
knew
any
thing
of
the
magician
that
made
such
a
noise
in
town
?
<EOS>
The
misanthrope
answered
as
usual
,
in
a
surly
tone
,
"
By
your
question
you
must
either
take
me
for
a
pimp
or
an
ideot
.
<EOS>
What
,
in
the
name
of
nonsense
,
should
I
know
of
such
a
rascal
,
unless
I
were
to
court
his
acquaintance
with
a
view
to
feast
my
own
spleen
,
in
seeing
him
fool
the
whole
nation
out
of
their
money
?
<EOS>
Tho
'
,
I
suppose
,
his
chief
profits
arise
from
his
practice
,
in
quality
of
pander
.
<EOS>
All
fortune
-
tellers
are
bawds
,
and
for
that
reason
are
so
much
followed
by
people
of
fashion
.
<EOS>
This
fellow
(
I
warrant
)
has
got
sundry
convenient
apartments
for
the
benefit
of
procreation
;
for
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
those
who
visit
him
on
the
pretence
of
consulting
his
supernatural
art
,
can
be
such
fools
,
such
drivelers
,
as
to
believe
that
he
can
actually
prognosticate
future
events
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
company
,
according
to
his
expectation
,
imputed
his
remarks
to
the
rancour
of
his
disposition
,
which
could
not
bear
to
think
that
any
person
upon
earth
was
wiser
than
himself
;
and
his
ears
were
regaled
with
a
thousand
instances
of
the
conjurer
's
wonderful
prescience
,
for
which
he
was
altogether
indebted
to
fiction
.
<EOS>
Some
of
these
specimens
being
communicated
to
him
,
by
way
of
appeal
to
his
opinion
,
"
They
are
(
said
he
)
meer
phantoms
of
ignorance
and
credulity
,
swelled
up
in
the
repetition
,
like
those
unsubstantial
bubbles
which
the
boys
blow
up
in
soap
-
suds
with
a
tobacco
pipe
.
    
<EOS>
And
this
will
ever
be
the
case
in
the
propagation
of
all
extraordinary
intelligence
:
the
imagination
naturally
magnifies
      
seeing
him
very
much
irritated
<EOS>
,
positively
denied
that
he
had
mentioned
a
brace
;
one
indeed
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
own
I
took
notice
of
,
upon
the
authority
of
your
own
physician
,
who
gave
me
an
account
of
it
this
morning
.
"
<EOS>
"
By
the
Lord
!
(
cried
the
sufferer
in
a
rage
which
he
could
no
longer
contain
)
that
rascal
has
been
suborned
by
my
rival
,
to
slander
my
character
in
this
manner
;
but
I
'll
be
revenged
,
if
there
be
either
law
or
equity
in
England
.
"
<EOS>
He
had
scarce
pronounced
these
words
,
when
the
doctor
happened
to
enter
the
room
;
when
his
exasperated
patient
lifting
up
his
cane
,
"
Sirrah
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
if
I
live
,
I
'll
make
that
black
crow
the
blackest
circumstance
of
thy
whole

The
physician
,
confounded
at
this
address
,
assured
him
that
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
his
meaning
,
and
when
the
other
gentleman
explained
it
,
absolutely
denied
the
charge
,
affirming
he
had
said
no
more
than
that
he
had
vomited
a
quantity
of
something
as
black
as
a
crow
.
<EOS>
The
landlord
of
the
house
acknowledged
that
he
might
have
been
mistaken
;
and
thus
the
whole
mystery
was
explained
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
company
seemed
to
relish
the
story
of
the
three
black
crows
,
which
they
considered
as
an
impromptu
of
Cadwallader
's
own
invention
;
but
,
granting
it
to
be
true
,
they
unanimously
declared
that
it
could
have
no
weight
in
invalidating
the
testimony
of
divers
persons
of
honour
,
who
had
been
witnesses
of
the
magician
's
supernatural
skill
.
    
<EOS>
On
the
next
day
of
consultation
,
the
necromancer
being
in
the
chair
,
and
his
friend
behind
the
curtain
,
the
outward
door
was
scarce
opened
,
when
a
female
visitant
flounced
in
,
and
discovered
to
the
magician
the
features
of
one
of
those
inquisitive
ladies
,
whose
curiosity
,
he
knew
,
his
confederate
had
aroused
,
in
the
manner
above
described
.
<EOS>
She
addressed
herself
to
him
with
a
familiar
air
,
observing
,
that
she
had
heard
much
of
his
great
knowledge
,
and
was
come
to
be
a
witness
of
his
art
,
which
she
desired
him
to
display
,
in
declaring
what
he
knew
to
be
her
ruling
passion
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
who
was
no
stranger
to
her
disposition
,
assumed
the
pen
without
hesitation
,
and
furnished
her
with
an
answer
,
importing
,
that
the
love
of
money
predominated
,
and
scandal
possessed
the
next
place
in
her
heart
.
<EOS>
Far
from
being
offended
at
his
freedom
,
she
commended
his
frankness
with
a
smile
;
and
,
satisfied
of
his
uncommon
talents
,
expressed
a
desire
of
being
better
acquainted
with
his
person
:
<EOS>
nay
,
she
began
to
catechise
him
,
upon
the
private
history
of
divers
great
families
,
in
which
he
happened
to
be
well
versed
;
and
he
,
in
a
mysterious
manner
,
dropt
such
artful
hints
of
his
knowledge
,
that
she
was
amazed
at
his
capacity
,
and
actually
asked
if
his
art
was
communicable
.
<EOS>
The
conjurer
replied
in
the
affirmative
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
gave
her
to
understand
,
that
it
was
attainable
by
those
only
who
were
pure
and
undefiled
in
point
of
chastity
and
honour
;
or
such
as
,
by
a
long
course
of
penitence
,
had
weaned
themselves
from
all
attachments
to
the
flesh
.
    
<EOS>
She
not
only
disapproved
,
but
seemed
to
doubt
the
truth
of
this
assertion
;
telling
him
,
with
a
look
of
disdain
,
that
his
art
was
not
worth
having
,
if
one
could
not
use
it
for
the
benefit
of
one
's
pleasure
:
she
had
even
penetration
enough
to
take
notice
of
an
inconsistency
in
what
he
had
advanced
;
and
asked
,
why
he
himself
exercised
his
knowledge
for
hire
,
if
he
was
so
much
detached
from
all
worldly
concerns
.
<EOS>
"
Come
,
come
,
doctor
,
added
she
,
you
are
in
the
right
to
be
cautious
against
impertinent
curiosity
;
but
,
perhaps
,
I
may
make
it
worth
your
while
to
be
communicative
.
"
    
<EOS>
These
overtures
were
interrupted
by
a
rap
at
the
door
,
signifying
the
approach
of
another
client
;
upon
which
the
lady
inquired
for
his
private
passage
,
thro
'
which
she
might
retire
,
without
the
risque
of
being
seen
:
and
when
she
understood
he
was
deficient
in
that
convenience
,
she
withdrew
into
an
empty
room
,
adjoining
to
the
audience
-
chamber
,
in
order
to
conceal
herself
from
the
observation
of
the
new
-
comer
.
<EOS>
This
was
no
other
than
the
inamorata
,
who
came
by
appointment
to
receive
the
solution
of
her
doubts
:
and
the
Misanthrope
,
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
expose
her
to
the
censure
of
such
an
indefatigable
minister
of
fame
as
the
person
,
who
(
he
knew
)
would
listen
from
the
next
apartment
;
laid
her
under
the
necessity
of
refreshing
his
remembrance
with
a
recapitulation
of
her
former
confession
,
which
was
almost
finished
,
when
she
was
alarmed
by
a
noise
at
the
door
,
occasioned
by
two
gentlemen
who
attempted
to
enter
by
force
.
    
<EOS>
Terrified
at
this
uproar
,
which
disconcerted
the
magician
himself
,
she
ran
for
shelter
into
the
place
which
was
pre
-
occupied
by
the
other
lady
,
who
,
hearing
this
disturbance
,
had
closed
the
window
-
shutters
,
that
she
might
have
the
better
chance
of
remaining
unknown
.
    
<EOS>
Here
they
ensconced
themselves
,
in
the
utmost
consternation
,
while
the
necromancer
,
after
some
recollection
,
ordered
Hadgi
to
open
the
door
,
and
admit
the
rioters
,
who
(
he
hoped
)
would
be
over
-
awed
by
the
authority
of
his
appearance
.
<EOS>
The
janitor
had
no
sooner
obeyed
his
instructions
,
than
in
rushed
a
young
libertine
,
who
had
been
for
some
time
upon
the
town
,
together
with
his
tutor
,
who
was
a
worn
-
out
debauchee
,
well
known
to
the
magician
.
<EOS>
They
were
both
in
that
degree
of
intoxication
necessary
to
prepare
such
dispositions
for
what
they
commonly
call
frolicks
,
and
the
sober
part
of
mankind
feel
to
be
extravagant
outrages
against
the
laws
of
their
country
,
and
the
peace
of
their
fellow
-
subjects
.
<EOS>
Having
staggered
up
to
the
table
,
the
senior
,
who
undertook
to
be
spokesman
,
saluted
Cadwallader
with
"
How
do'st
do
,
old
Capricorn
?
<EOS>
Thou
seem'st
to
be
a
most
venerable
pimp
,
and
<EOS>
,
I
doubt
not
,
hast
abundance
of
discretion
.
<EOS>
Here
is
this
young
whoremaster
(
a
true
chip
of
the
old
venereal
block
his
father
)
and
myself
,
come
for
a
comfortable
cast
of
thy
function
.
<EOS>
I
do
n't
mean
that
stale
pretence
of
conjuring
:
damn
futurity
;
let
us
live
for
the
present
,
old
Haly
.
<EOS>
Conjure
me
up
a
couple
of
hale
wenches
,
and
,
I
warrant
,
we
shall
get
into
the
magic
circle
in
a
twinkling
.
<EOS>
What
says
Galileo
?
<EOS>
What
says
the
reverend
Brahe
?
<EOS>
Here
is
a
purse
,
you
pimp
:
hark
<EOS>
,
how
it
chinks
!
<EOS>
This
is
sweeter
than
the
musick
of
the
spheres
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
necromancer
,
perplexed
at
this
rencounter
,
made
no
reply
;
but
taking
up
his
wand
,
waved
it
around
his
head
in
a
very
mysterious
motion
,
with
a
view
of
intimidating
these
forward
visitants
,
who
,
far
from
being
awed
by
this
sort
of
evolution
,
became
more
and
more
obstreperous
,
and
even
threatened
to
pull
him
by
the
beard
,
if
he
would
not
immediately
comply
with
their
desire
.
    
<EOS>
Had
he
called
his
associate
,
or
even
Hadgi
,
to
his
aid
,
he
knew
he
could
have
soon
calmed
their
turbulence
;
but
,
being
unwilling
to
run
the
risque
of
a
discovery
,
or
even
of
a
riot
,
he
bethought
himself
of
chastising
their
insolence
in
another
manner
that
would
be
less
hazardous
,
and
rather
more
effectual
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
suggestion
,
he
pointed
his
wand
towards
the
door
of
the
apartment
in
which
the
ladies
had
taken
sanctuary
;
and
the
two
rakes
,
understanding
the
hint
,
rushed
in
without
hesitation
.
    
<EOS>
The
females
finding
their
place
of
retreat
taken
by
assault
,
ran
about
the
room
in
great
consternation
,
and
were
immediately
taken
prisoners
by
the
assailants
,
who
pulling
them
towards
the
windows
,
opened
the
shutters
at
the
same
instant
of
time
,
when
(
strange
to
tell
!
)
<EOS>
one
of
the
heroes
discovered
,
in
the
prize
he
had
made
,
the
very
wife
of
his
bosom
;
and
his
companion
perceived
that
he
had
stumbled
in
the
dark
upon
his
own
mother
.
<EOS>
Their
mutual
astonishment
was
unspeakable
at
this
eclaircissement
,
which
produced
an
universal
silence
for
the
space
of
several
minutes
;
and
during
this
pause
the
ladies
having
recollected
themselves
,
an
expostulation
was
begun
by
the
elder
of
the
two
,
who
roundly
took
her
son
to
task
for
his
disorderly
life
,
which
laid
her
under
the
disagreeable
necessity
of
watching
his
motions
,
and
detecting
him
in
such
an
infamous
place
.
    
<EOS>
While
the
careful
mother
thus
exercised
her
talent
for
reprehension
,
the
hopeful
young
gentleman
,
with
an
hand
in
each
fob
,
stood
whistling
an
opera
-
tune
,
without
seeming
to
pay
the
most
profound
regard
to
his
parent
's
reproof
:
and
the
other
lady
,
in
imitation
of
such
a
consummate
pattern
,
began
to
open
upon
her
husband
,
whom
she
bitterly
reproached
with
his
looseness
and
intemperance
,
demanding
to
know
what
he
had
to
alledge
in
alleviation
of
his
present
misconduct
.
<EOS>
The
surprize
occasioned
by
such
an
unexpected
meeting
had
already
in
a
great
measure
destroyed
the
effects
of
the
wine
he
had
so
plentifully
drank
,
and
the
first
use
he
made
of
his
recovered
sobriety
,
was
to
revolve
within
himself
the
motives
that
could
possibly
induce
his
wife
to
give
him
the
rendezvous
in
this
manner
.
<EOS>
As
he
had
good
reason
to
believe
she
was
utterly
void
of
jealousy
,
he
naturally
placed
this
rencontre
to
the
account
of
another
passion
;
and
his
chagrin
was
not
at
all
impaired
by
the
effrontery
with
which
she
now
presumed
to
reprimand
him
.
<EOS>
He
listened
to
her
,
therefore
,
with
a
grave
,
or
rather
grim
aspect
;
and
to
the
question
with
which
she
concluded
her
rebuke
,
answered
with
great
composure
,
"
All
that
I
have
to
alledge
,
madam
,
is
that
the
bawd
has
committed
a
mistake
,
in
consequence
of
which
we
are
both
disappointed
:
and
so
,
ladies
,
your
humble
servant
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
retired
with
manifest
confusion
in
his
looks
;
and
as
he
passed
through
the
audience
-
chamber
,
eying
the
conjurer
askance
,
pronounced
the
epithet
of
precious
rascal
,
with
great
emphasis
.
<EOS>
Mean
while
,
the
junior
,
like
a
dutiful
child
,
handed
his
mamma
to
her
chair
;
and
the
other
client
,
after
having
reviled
the
necromancer
,
because
he
could
not
foresee
this
event
,
went
away
in
a
state
of
mortification
.
    
<EOS>
The
coast
being
clear
,
Peregrine
came
forth
from
his
den
,
and
congratulated
his
friend
upon
the
peaceable
issue
of
the
adventure
which
he
had
overheard
:
<EOS>
but
,
that
he
might
not
be
exposed
to
such
inconvenience
for
the
future
,
they
resolved
,
that
a
grate
should
be
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
outward
door
,
through
which
the
conjurer
himself
should
reconnoitre
all
the
visitants
,
before
their
admission
;
so
that
,
to
those
whose
appearance
he
should
not
like
,
Hadgi
should
,
without
opening
,
give
notice
,
that
his
master
was
engaged
.
<EOS>
By
this
expedient
too
,
they
provided
against
those
difficulties
which
Cadwallader
must
have
encountered
,
in
giving
satisfaction
to
strangers
,
whom
he
did
not
know
;
for
the
original
intention
of
the
founders
was
to
confine
the
practice
of
their
art
to
people
of
fashion
only
,
most
of
whom
were
personally
known
to
the
counterfeit
magician
and
his
coadjutor
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
these
associates
,
Cadwallader
in
particular
,
notwithstanding
his
boasted
insight
into
the
characters
of
life
,
never
imagined
that
his
pretended
skill
would
be
consulted
by
any
but
the
weaker
-
minded
of
the
female
sex
,
incited
by
that
spirit
of
curiosity
which
he
knew
was
implanted
in
their
nature
:
but
,
in
the
course
of
his
practice
,
he
found
himself
cultivated
in
his
preternatural
capacity
,
by
people
of
all
sexes
,
complexions
,
and
degrees
of
reputation
,
and
had
occasion
to
observe
,
that
when
the
passions
are
concerned
,
howsoever
cool
,
cautious
and
deliberate
,
the
disposition
may
otherwise
be
,
there
is
nothing
so
idle
,
frivolous
,
or
absurd
,
to
which
they
will
not
apply
for
encouragement
and
gratification
.
    
<EOS>
The
last
occurrence
,
according
to
the
hopes
and
expectation
of
the
confederates
,
was
whispered
about
by
the
ladies
concerned
,
in
such
a
manner
,
that
the
whole
affair
was
,
in
a
few
days
,
the
universal
topic
of
discourse
,
in
which
it
was
retailed
with
numberless
embellishments
,
invented
by
the
parties
themselves
,
who
had
long
indulged
a
pique
at
each
other
,
and
took
this
opportunity
of
enjoying
their
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
These
incidents
,
while
they
regaled
the
spleen
,
at
the
same
time
augmented
the
renown
of
the
conjurer
,
who
was
described
on
both
sides
as
a
very
extraordinary
person
in
his
way
;
and
the
alteration
in
his
door
was
no
sooner
performed
,
than
he
had
occasion
to
avail
himself
of
it
,
against
the
intrusion
of
a
great
many
,
with
whom
he
would
have
found
it
very
difficult
to
support
the
fame
he
had
acquired
.
    
<EOS>
Among
those
who
appeared
at
his
grate
,
he
perceived
a
certain
clergyman
,
whom
he
had
long
known
an
humble
attendant
on
the
great
,
and
with
some
the
reputed
minister
of
their
pleasures
:
This
Levite
had
disguised
himself
in
a
great
coat
,
boots
,
and
dress
quite
foreign
to
the
habit
worn
by
those
of
his
function
;
and
being
admitted
,
attempted
to
impose
himself
as
a
country
squire
upon
the
conjurer
,
who
calling
him
by
his
name
,
desired
him
to
sit
down
.
    
<EOS>
This
reception
corresponding
with
the
report
he
had
heard
,
touching
our
magician
's
art
,
the
doctor
said
he
would
lay
aside
all
dissimulation
;
and
after
having
professed
an
implicit
belief
,
that
his
supernatural
knowledge
did
not
proceed
from
any
communication
with
evil
spirits
,
but
was
the
immediate
gift
of
heaven
,
he
declared
the
intention
of
his
coming
was
to
inquire
into
the
health
of
a
good
friend
and
brother
of
his
,
who
possessed
a
certain
living
in
the
country
,
which
he
named
;
and
,
as
he
was
old
and
infirm
,
to
know
what
space
of
time
was
allotted
to
him
in
this
frail
state
of
mortality
,
that
he
might
have
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
attending
him
in
his
last
moments
,
and
assisting
him
in
his
preparations
for
eternity
.
    
<EOS>
The
,
conjurer
,
who
at
once
perceived
the
purport
of
this
question
,
after
a
solemn
pause
,
during
which
he
seemed
absorpt
in
contemplation
,
delivered
this
response
to
his
consulter
,
"
Tho
'
<EOS>
I
foresee
some
occurrences
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
be
omniscient
.
<EOS>
I
know
not
to
what
age
that
clergyman
's
life
will
extend
,
but
so
far
I
can
penetrate
into
the
womb
of
time
,
as
to
discern
,
that
the

"
This
dreadful
sentence
in
a
moment
banished
the
blood
from
the
face
of
the
appalled
consulter
,
who
hearing
his
own
doom
pronounced
,
began
to
tremble
in
every
joint
;
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
in
the
agony
of
fear
,
and
saying
,
"
The
will
of
God
be
done
,
"
withdrew
in
silent
despondence
,
his
teeth
chattering
with
terror
and
dismay
.
    
<EOS>
This
client
was
succeeded
by
an
old
man
about
the
age
of
seventy
-
five
,
who
being
resolved
to
purchase
a
lease
,
desired
to
be
determined
in
the
term
of
years
by
the
necromancer
's
advice
,
observing
,
that
as
he
had
no
children
of
his
own
body
,
and
had
no
regard
for
his
heirs
at
law
,
the
purchase
would
be
made
with
a
view
to
his
own
convenience
only
;
and
therefore
,
considering
his
age
,
he
himself
hesitated
in
the
period
of
the
lease
,
between
thirty
and
threescore
years
.
    
<EOS>
The
conjurer
,
upon
due
deliberation
,
advised
him
to
double
the
last
specified
term
,
because
he
distinguished
in
his
features
something
portending
extreme
old
age
and
second
childhood
,
and
he
ought
to
provide
for
that
state
of
incapacity
,
which
otherwise
would
be
attended
with
infinite
misery
and
affliction
.
    
<EOS>
The
superannuated
wretch
,
thunderstruck
with
this
prediction
,
held
up
his
hands
,
and
,
in
the
first
transports
of
his
apprehension
,
exclaimed
,
"
Lord
have
mercy
upon
me
!
<EOS>
I
have
not
wherewithal
to
purchase
such
a
long
lease
,
and
I
have
long
outlived
all
my
friends
;
what
then
must
become
of
me
,
sinner
that
I
am
,
one
hundred
and
twenty
years
hence
!
"
<EOS>
Cadwallader
(
who
enjoyed
his
terror
)
under
pretence
of
alleviating
his
concern
,
told
him
,
that
what
he
had
prognosticated
did
not
deprive
him
of
the
means
which
he
and
every
person
had
in
their
power
,
to
curtail
a
life
of
misfortune
;
and
the
old
gentleman
went
away
,
seemingly
comforted
with
the
assurance
,
that
it
would
always
be
in
his
power
to
employ
an
halter
for
his
own
deliverance
.
    
<EOS>
"
Soon
after
the
retreat
of
this
elder
,
the
magician
was
visited
by
one
of
those
worthies
known
among
the
Romans
by
the
appellation
of
Heredipetes
,
who
had
amassed
a
large
fortune
by
a
close
attention
to
the
immediate
wants
and
weakness
of
raw
unexperienced
heirs
.
<EOS>
This
honourable
usurer
had
sold
an
annuity
upon
the
life
of
a
young
spendthrift
,
being
thereto
induced
by
the
affirmation
of
his
physician
,
who
had
assured
him
his
patient
's
constitution
was
so
rotten
,
that
he
could
not
live
one
year
to
an
end
:
he
had
,
nevertheless
,
made
shift
to
weather
eighteen
months
,
and
now
seemed
more
vigorous
and
healthy
than
he
had
ever
been
known
;
for
he
was
supposed
to
have
nourished
an
hereditary
pox
from
his
cradle
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
at
this
alteration
,
the
seller
came
to
consult
Cadwallader
not
only
about
the
life
of
the
annuitant
,
but
also
concerning
the
state
of
his
health
at
the
time
of
his
purchasing
the
annuity
,
purposing
to
sue
the
physician
for
false
intelligence
,
should
the
conjurer
declare
that
the
young
man
was
found
,
when
the
doctor
pronounced
him
diseased
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
a
piece
of
satisfaction
he
did
not
obtain
from
the
Misanthrope
,
who
,
in
order
to
punish
his
sordid
disposition
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
the
physician
had
told
him
the
truth
,
and
nothing
but
the
truth
;
and
that
the
young
gentleman
was
in
a
fair
way
of
attaining
a
comfortable
old
age
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
is
to
say
(
cried
the
client
,
in
the
impatience
of
his
mortification
at
this
answer
)
bating
accidents
;
for
,
thank
God
,
the
annuitant
does
not
lead
the
most
regular
life
:
besides
,
I
am
credibly
informed
he
is
choleric
and
rash
;
so
that
he
may
be
concerned
in
a
duel
:
then
there
are
such
things
as
riots
in
the
street
,
in
which
a
rake
's
skull
may
be
casually
cracked
;
he
may
be
overturned
in
a
coach
,
overset
in
the
river
,
thrown
from
a
vicious
horse
,
overtaken
with
a
cold
,
endangered
by
a
surfeit
;
but
what
I
place
my
chief
confidence
in
,
is
an
hearty
pox
,
a
distemper
which
hath
been
fatal
to
his
whole
family
.
<EOS>
Not
but
that
the
issue
of
all
these
things
is
uncertain
;
and
expedients
might
be
found
,
which
would
more
effectually
answer
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
I
know
they
have
arts
in
India
,
by
which
a
man
can
secure
his
own
interest
,
in
the
salutation
of
a
friendly
shake
by
the
hand
;
and
I
do
n't
doubt
that
you
who
have
lived
in
that
country
,
are
master
of
the
secret
.
<EOS>
To
be
sure
,
if
you
was
inclined
to
communicate
such
a
nostrum
,
there
are
abundance
of
people
who
would
purchase
it
,
at
a
very
high
price
.
"
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
understood
this
insinuation
,
and
was
tempted
to
amuse
him
in
such
a
manner
as
would
tend
to
his
disgrace
and
confusion
;
but
,
considering
that
the
case
was
of
too
criminal
a
nature
to
be
tampered
with
,
he
withstood
his
desire
of
punishing
this
rapacious
cormorant
any
other
way
than
by
telling
him
,
he
would
not
impart
that
secret
for
his
whole
fortune
ten
times
doubled
;
so
that
the
usurer
retired
,
very
much
dissatisfied
with
the
issue
of
his
consultation
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
person
who
presented
himself
at
this
altar
of
intelligence
,
was
an
author
,
who
recommended
himself
to
a
gratis
advice
,
by
observing
that
a
prophet
and
poet
were
known
by
the
same
appellation
among
the
antients
;
and
that
,
at
this
day
,
both
the
one
and
the
other
spoke
by
inspiration
.
<EOS>
The
conjurer
refused
to
own
this
affinity
,
which
,
he
said
,
formerly
subsisted
,
because
both
species
of
the
Vates
were
the
children
of
fiction
;
but
as
he
himself
did
not
fall
under
that
predicament
,
he
begged
leave
to
disown
all
connexion
with
the
family
of
the
poets
;
and
the
poor
author
would
have
been
dismissed
without
his
errand
,
tho
'
he
offered
to
leave
an
ode
as
security
for
the
magician
's
fee
,
to
be
paid
from
the
profits
of
his
first
third
night
,
had
not
Cadwallader
's
curiosity
prompted
him
to
know
the
subject
of
this
gentleman
's
inquiry
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
told
him
,
that
in
consideration
of
his
genius
,
he
would
for
once
satisfy
him
,
without
a
fee
;
and
desired
him
to
specify
the
doubts
in
which
he
wished
to
be
resolved
.
    
<EOS>
The
son
of
Parnassus
,
glad
of
this
condescension
,
for
which
he
thanked
the
necromancer
,
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
had
some
time
before
presented
a
play
in
manuscript
to
a
certain
great
man
,
at
the
head
of
taste
,
who
had
not
only
read
and
approved
the
performance
,
but
also
undertaken
to
introduce
and
support
it
on
the
stage
;
that
he
(
the
author
)
was
assured
by
this
patron
,
that
the
play
was
already
(
in
consequence
of
his
recommendation
)
<EOS>
accepted
by
one
of
the
managers
,
who
had
faithfully
promised
to
bring
it
to
light
;
but
that
,
when
he
waited
on
this
same
manager
,
to
know
when
he
intended
to
put
his
production
into
rehearsal
,
the
man
declared
he
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
the
piece
:
"
Now
,
Mr
Conjurer
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
want
to
know
whether
or
not
my
play
has
been
presented
,
and
if
I
have
any
sort
of
chance
of
seeing
it
acted
this
winter
?
"
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
who
had
,
in
his
younger
days
,
sported
among
the
theatrical
muses
,
began
to
lose
his
temper
at
this
question
,
which
recalled
the
remembrance
of
his
own
disappointments
;
and
dispatched
the
author
with
an
abrupt
answer
,
importing
,
that
the
affairs
of
the
stage
were
altogether
without
the
sphere
of
his
divination
,
being
intirely
regulated
by
the
daemons
of
dissimulation
,
ignorance
,
and
caprice
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
an
endless
task
to
recount
every
individual
response
which
our
magician
delivered
,
in
the
course
of
his
conjuration
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
consulted
in
all
cases
of
law
,
physic
,
and
trade
,
over
and
above
the
ordinary
subjects
of
marriage
and
fornication
;
his
advice
and
assistance
were
sollicited
by
sharpers
who
desired
to
possess
an
infallible
method
of
cheating
,
unperceived
;
by
fortune
-
hunters
who
wanted
to
make
prize
of
widows
and
heiresses
;
by
debauchees
who
were
disposed
to
lye
with
other
men
's
wives
;
by
coxcombs
who
longed
for
the
death
of
their
fathers
;
by
wenches
with
child
,
who
wished
themselves
rid
of
their
burthens
;
by
merchants
who
had
insured
above
value
,
and
thirsted
after
the
news
of
a
wreck
;
by
under
-
writers
who
prayed
for
the
gift
of
prescience
,
that
they
might
venture
money
upon
such
ships
only
,
as
should
perform
the
voyage
in
safety
;
by
Jews
who
wanted
to
foresee
the
fluctuations
of
stock
;
by
usurers
who
advance
money
upon
undecided
causes
;
by
clients
who
were
dubious
of
the
honesty
of
their
council
:
in
short
,
all
matters
of
uncertain
issue
were
appealed
to
this
tribunal

in
point
of
calculation
,
De

utterly
neglected

Chapter
XCII
<EOS>
The
conjurer
and
his
associate
execute
a
plan
of
vengeance
against
certain
infidels
who
pretend
to
despise
their
art
;
and
Peregrine
atchieves
an
adventure
with
a
young
nobleman
.
   
<EOS>
By
these
means
,
the
whole
variety
of
character
undisguised
,
passed
as
it
were
in
review
before
the
confederates
,
who
,
by
divers
ingenious
contrivances
,
punished
the
most
flagrant
offenders
with
as
much
severity
as
the
nature
of
their
plan
would
allow
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
they
projected
a
scheme
for
chastising
a
number
of
their
own
acquaintance
,
who
had
all
along
professed
the
utmost
contempt
for
the
talents
of
this
conjurer
,
which
they
endeavoured
to
ridicule
in
all
companies
,
where
his
surprising
art
was
the
subject
of
discourse
;
not
that
they
had
sense
and
discernment
enough
to
perceive
the
absurdity
of
his
pretensions
,
but
affected
a
singularity
of
opinion
,
with
a
view
of
insulting
the
inferior
understandings
of
those
who
were
deceived
by
such
an
idle
impostor
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
indeed
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
had
always
espoused
their
judgment
in
this
case
,
and
joined
them
in
reviling
the
public
character
of
his
friend
;
but
he
knew
how
far
the
capacities
of
those
virtuosi
extended
,
and
had
frequently
caught
them
in
the
fact
of
recounting
their
exploits
against
the
conjurer
,
which
were
the
productions
of
their
own
invention
only
.
<EOS>
On
these
considerations
,
his
wrath
was
kindled
against
them
,
and
he
accordingly
concerted
measures
with
his
coadjutor
,
for
overwhelming
them
with
confusion
and
dismay
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
first
place
,
a
report
was
spread
by
his
emissaries
,
that
the
magician
had
undertaken
to
entertain
the
view
with
the
appearance
of
any
person
whom
his
customers
should
desire
to
see
,
whether
dead
,
or
at
the
distance
of
a
thousand
leagues
.
<EOS>
This
extraordinary
proposal
chancing
to
be
the
subject
of
conversation
,
in
a
place
where
most
of
those
infidels
were
assembled
,
they
talked
of
it
in
the
usual
stile
,
and
some
of
them
swore
,
the
fellow
ought
to
be
pillory'd
for
his
presumption
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
seizing
this
favourable
opportunity
,
acquiesced
in
their
remarks
,
and
observed
with
great
vehemence
,
that
it
would
be
a
meritorious
action
to
put
the
rascal
to
the
proof
,
and
then
toss
him
in
a
blanket
for
non
-
performance
.
<EOS>
They
were
wonderfully
pleased
with
this
suggestion
,
and
forthwith
determined
to
try
the
experiment
;
though
,
as
they
understood
the
apparition
would
be
produced
to
one
only
at
a
time
,
they
could
not
immediately
agree
in
the
choice
of
the
person
who
should
stand
the
first
brunt
of
the
magician
's
skill
.
    
<EOS>
While
each
of
them
severally
excused
himself
from
this
preference
on
various
pretences
,
Peregrine
readily
undertook
the
post
,
expressing
great
confidence
of
the
conjurer
's
incapacity
to
give
him
the
least
cause
of
apprehension
.
    
<EOS>
This
point
being
settled
,
they
detached
one
of
their
number
to
Crabtree
,
in
order
to
bespeak
and
adjust
the
hours
and
terms
of
the
operation
,
which
he
insisted
upon
performing
at
his
own
apartment
,
where
every
thing
was
prepared
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
At
the
appointed
time
,
they
went
thither
in
a
body
,
to
the
number
of
seven
,
in
full
expectation
of
detecting
the
impostor
;
and
were
received
with
such
gloomy
formality
,
as
seemed
to
have
an
effect
upon
the
countenances
of
some
among
them
;
though
they
were
encouraged
by
the
vivacity
of
Pickle
,
who
affected
a
double
share
of
petulance
,
for
the
more
effectual
accomplishment
of
his
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
made
no
reply
to
the
interrogations
they
uttered
,
in
the
levity
of
their
insolence
,
at
their
first
entrance
,
but
ordered
Hadgi
to
conduct
them
through
the
next
room
,
that
they
might
see
there
was
no
previous
apparatus
to
affright
their
deputy
with
objects
foreign
to
his
undertaking
.
<EOS>
They
found
nothing
but
a
couple
of
wax
-
tapers
burning
on
a
table
that
stood
with
a
chair
by
it
,
in
the
middle
of
the
apartment
,
and
returned
to
the
audience
-
chamber
,
leaving
Peregrine
by
himself
,
to
encounter
the
phantom
of
that
person
,
whom
they
should
(
without
his
knowledge
)
desire
the
magician
to
conjure
up
to
his
view
.
    
<EOS>
All
the
doors
being
shut
,
and
the
company
seated
,
a
profound
silence
ensued
,
together
with
a
face
of
dreadful
expectation
,
encouraged
by
the
blue
flame
of
the
candles
,
which
were
tipt
with
sulphur
for
that
purpose
,
and
heightened
by
the
dismal
sound
of
a
large
bell
,
which
Hadgi
tolled
in
the
anti
-
chamber
.
<EOS>
Cadwallader
having
thus
practised
upon
their
ignorance
and
fear
,
desired
them
to
name
the
person
to
be
produced
;
and
after
some
whispers
among
themselves
,
one
of
them
took
the
pen
,
and
writing
the
name
of
commodore
Trunnion
upon
a
slip
of
paper
,
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
magician
,
who
rose
from
his
seat
,
and
opening
the
door
of
his
closet
,
displayed
to
their
view
a
scull
,
with
thigh
-
bones
crossed
upon
a
table
covered
with
black
cloth
.
    
<EOS>
This
melancholy
spectacle
made
a
remarkable
impression
upon
the
imaginations
of
the
company
,
already
prepossessed
by
the
previous
ceremony
;
and
they
began
to
survey
one
another
with
looks
of
consternation
,
while
Cadwallader
shutting
himself
in
the
closet
,
that
was
contiguous
to
the
chamber
in
which
his
friend
Peregrine
was
stationed
,
thrust
the
label
with
his
uncle
's
name
through
a
small
chink
in
the
partition
,
according
to
agreement
,
muttering
all
the
time
a
sort
of
gibberish
,
that
increased
the
pannic
of
his
audience
;
then
returning
to
his
chair
,
the
knell
was
knolled
again
,
and
Pickle
called
aloud
,
"
Damn
your
mummery
,
why
do
n't
you
dispatch
?
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
signal
to
Crabtree
,
who
thus
certified
of
his
having
received
the
paper
,
stood
up
and
waved
his
wand
in
the
figure
of
an
S.
<EOS>
The
motion
being
thrice
performed
,
their
ears
were
all
of
a
sudden
invaded
by
a
terrible
noise
in
the
next
room
,
accompanied
with
the
voice
of
Peregrine
,
who
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
horror
and
amazement
,
"
Guard
me
,
heaven
!
<EOS>
my
uncle
Trunnion
!
"
    
<EOS>
This
ejaculation
had
such
an
effect
upon
the
hearers
,
that
two
of
them
swooned
with
fear
,
a
third
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
prayed
aloud
,
while
the
other
three
,
in
a
transport
of
dismay
and
distraction
,
burst
open
the
door
,
and
rushed
into
the
haunted
chamber
,
where
they
found
the
table
and
chair
overturned
,
and
Peregrine
extended
(
in
all
appearance
)
without
sense
or
motion
,
upon
the
floor
.
    
<EOS>
They
immediately
began
to
chase
his
temples
,
and
the
first
symptom
of
his
recovery
,
which
they
perceived
,
was
an
hollow
groan
;
after
which
,
he
pronounced
these
words
:
"
Merciful
powers
!
<EOS>
if
I
live
,
I
saw
the
commodore
with
his
black
patch
,
in
the
very
cloaths
he
wore
at
my
sister
's
wedding
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
declaration
compleated
their
astonishment
and
terror
;
they
observed
a
wildness
in
his
looks
,
which
he
seemed
to
bend
on
something
concealed
from
their
view
;
and
were
infected
by
his
appearance
to
such
a
pitch
of
superstition
,
that
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
to
persuade
them
,
that
the
chair
and
table
were
apparitions
of
their
forefathers
.
<EOS>
However
,
they
conducted
Peregrine
into
the
council
chamber
,
where
the
conjurer
and
Hadgi
were
employed
in
ministring
to
those
who
had
fainted
:
and
the
patients
having
retrieved
the
use
of
their
faculties
,
Cadwallader
assuming
a
double
portion
of
severity
in
his
aspect
,
asked
if
they
were
not
ashamed
of
their
former
incredulity
;
declaring
,
that
he
was
ready
to
give
them
more
convincing
proofs
of
his
art
upon
the
spot
,
and
would
immediately
recal
three
generations
of
their
progenitors
from
the
dead
,
if
they
were
disposed
to
relish
such
company
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
one
of
them
,
whose
great
grandfather
had
been
hanged
,
"
Are
you
(
said
he
)
ambitious
of
seeing
the
first
remarkable
personage
of
your
family
?
<EOS>
Say
the
word
;
and
he
shall
appear
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
youth
,
who
had
been
the
most
insolent
and
obstreperous
of
the
whole
society
,
and
was
now
depressed
with
the
same
proportion
of
fear
,
alarmed
at
the
proposal
,
assured
the
magician
,
he
had
no
curiosity
of
that
sort
remaining
;
and
that
,
what
he
had
already
seen
,
would
(
he
hoped
)
have
a
good
effect
upon
his
future
life
and
conversation
.
<EOS>
Every
one
of
these
heroes
made
an
acknowledgment
and
profession
of
the
same
kind
,
some
of
which
were
attended
with
tears
;
and
Hadgi
having
provided
chairs
for
the
whole
company
,
they
departed
exceedingly
crest
-
fallen
;
and
two
of
the
number
actually
sickened
with
the
agitation
they
had
undergone
,
while
our
hero
and
his
associate
made
themselves
merry
with
the
success
of
their
enterprize
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
scheme
of
fortune
-
telling
did
not
engross
his
whole
attention
;
he
still
continued
to
maintain
his
appearance
in
the
beau
monde
;
and
as
his
expence
far
exceeded
his
income
,
strove
to
contract
intimacies
with
people
of
interest
and
power
:
he
shewed
himself
regularly
at
court
,
paid
his
respects
to
them
in
all
places
of
public
diversion
,
and
frequently
entered
into
their
parties
,
either
of
pleasure
or
cards
.
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
cultivation
,
he
happened
one
evening
,
at
a
certain
chocolate
-
house
,
to
overlook
a
match
at
piquet
,
in
which
he
perceived
a
couple
of
sharpers
making
prey
of
a
young
nobleman
,
who
had
neither
temper
nor
skill
sufficient
to
cope
with
such
antagonists
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
being
a
professed
enemy
to
all
knights
of
industry
,
could
not
bear
to
see
them
cheat
in
publick
with
such
insolent
audacity
;
and
therefore
,
under
pretence
of
communicating
some
business
of
importance
,
he
begg'd
the
favour
of
speaking
to
the
young
gentleman
in
another
corner
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
friendly
manner
cautioned
him
against
the
arts
of
his
opponents
.
<EOS>
This
hot
-
headed
representative
,
far
from
thinking
or
owning
himself
obliged
to
Pickle
for
his
good
counsel
,
looked
upon
the
advice
as
an
insult
upon
his
understanding
;
and
replied
with
an
air
of
ferocious
displeasure
,
that
he
knew
how
to
take
care
of
his
own
concerns
,
and
would
not
suffer
either
him
or
them
to
bubble
him
out
of
one
shilling
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
offended
at
the
association
,
as
well
as
at
the
ingratitude
and
folly
of
this
conceited
coxcomb
,
expressed
his
resentment
,
by
telling
him
,
that
he
expected
at
least
an
acknowledgement
for
his
candid
intention
;
but
he
found
his
intellects
too
much
warped
by
his
vanity
,
to
perceive
his
own
want
of
capacity
and
experience
.
<EOS>
Inflamed
by
this
reproof
,
the
young
nobleman
challenged
him
to
play
for
five
hundred
pounds
,
with
many
opprobrious
,
or
at
least
contemptuous
terms
of
defiance
,
which
provoked
our
hero
to
accept
the
proposal
;
and
after
the
other
had
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
rooks
,
who
were
extremely
mortified
at
the
interruption
,
the
two
young
champions
sat
down
,
and
fortune
acting
with
uncommon
impartiality
,
Pickle
,
by
the
superiority
of
his
talents
,
in
two
hours
won
to
the
amount
of
as
many
thousand
pounds
,
for
which
he
was
obliged
to
take
his
antagonist
's
note
,
the
sharpers
having
previously
secured
his
ready
money
.
    
<EOS>
Frantic
with
his
loss
,
the
rash
young
man
would
have
continued
the
game
,
and
doubled
stakes
every
time
;
so
that
Peregrine
might
have
increased
his
acquisition
to
ten
times
the
sum
he
had
gained
;
but
he
thought
he
had
already
sufficiently
chastised
the
presumption
of
the
challenger
,
and
was
unwilling
to
impower
fortune
to
ravish
from
him
the
fruits
of
his
success
:
he
therefore
declined
my
lord
's
proposal
,
unless
he
would
play
for
ready
money
;
and
his
lordship
having
in
vain
tried
his
credit
among
the
company
,
our
adventurer
withdrew
,
leaving
him
in
an
extasy
of
rage
and
disappointment
.
    
<EOS>
As
the
insolence
of
his
behaviour
had
increased
with
his
ill
luck
,
and
he
had
given
vent
to
divers
expressions
,
which
Peregrine
took
amiss
,
our
young
gentleman
resolved
to
augment
his
punishment
,
by
teazing
him
with
demands
which
could
not
,
he
knew
,
be
immediately
satisfied
;
and
next
day
,
sent
Pipes
to
his
father
's
house
with
the
note
,
which
was
drawn
payable
upon
demand
.
<EOS>
The
debtor
,
who
had
gone
to
bed
half
distracted
with
his
misfortune
,
finding
himself
waked
with
such
a
disagreeable
dun
,
lost
all
patience
,
cursed
Pickle
,
threatened
his
messenger
,
blasphemed
with
horrible
execrations
,
and
made
such
a
noise
,
as
reached
the
ears
of
his
father
,
who
ordering
his
son
to
be
called
into
his
presence
,
examined
him
about
the
cause
of
that
uproar
,
which
had
disturbed
the
whole
family
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
after
having
essayed
to
amuse
him
with
sundry
equivocations
,
which
served
only
to
increase
his
suspicion
,
and
desire
of
knowing
the
truth
,
acknowledged
that
he
had
lost
some
money
overnight
at
cards
,
to
a
gamester
,
who
had
been
so
impertinent
as
to
send
a
message
,
demanding
it
that
morning
,
though
he
had
told
the
fellow
,
it
would
not
suit
him
to
pay
it
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
The
father
,
who
was
a
man
of
honour
,
reproached
him
with
great
severity
for
his
profligate
behaviour
in
general
,
and
this
scandalous
debt
in
particular
,
which
he
believed
to
be
some
trifle
,
and
giving
him
a
bank
note
for
five
hundred
pounds
,
commanded
him
to
go
and
discharge
it
,
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
This
well
-
principled
heir
took
the
money
,
but
instead
of
waiting
upon
his
creditor
,
he
forthwith
repaired
to
the
gaming
-
house
,
in
hopes
of
retrieving
his
loss
;
and
before
he
rose
from
the
table
,
saw
his
note
mortgaged
for
seven
eighths
of
its
value
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Pickle
,
incensed
at
the
treatment
which
his
servant
had
received
,
and
informed
of
his
lordship
's
second
loss
,
which
aggravated
his
resentment
,
determined
to
preserve
no
medium
;
and
taking
out
a
writ
that
same
day
,
put
it
immediately
in
execution
upon
the
body
of
his
debtor
,
just
as
he
stepp'd
into
his
chair
,
at
the
door
of
White
's
Chocolate
-
house
.
<EOS>
The
prisoner
being
naturally
fierce
and
haughty
,
attempted
to
draw
upon
the
bailiffs
,
who
disarmed
him
in
a
twinkling
;
and
this
effort
served
only
to
heighten
his
disgrace
,
which
was
witnessed
by
a
thousand
people
,
most
of
whom
laughed
very
heartily
,
at
the
adventure
of
a
lord
's
being
arrested
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
public
transaction
could
not
long
escape
the
knowledge
of
his
father
,
who
(
that
very
day
)
had
the
satisfaction
to
hear
that
his
son
was
in
a
spunging
-
house
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
information
,
he
sent
his
steward
to
learn
the
particulars
of
the
arrest
,
and
was
equally
offended
,
surprized
,
and
concerned
,
when
he
understood
the
nature
of
the
debt
,
which
he
imagined
his
son
had
already
discharged
.
    
<EOS>
Unwilling
to
pay
such
a
considerable
sum
for
a
spendthrift
,
whom
he
had
but
too
much
indulged
,
and
who
in
less
than
one
week
might
involve
himself
in
such
another
difficulty
,
the
old
gentleman
wrote
a
letter
to
Peregrine
,
representing
what
a
hardship
it
would
be
upon
him
to
forfeit
such
sums
by
the
indiscretion
of
a
son
,
whose
engagements
he
was
not
bound
to
fulfil
,
and
desiring
some
mitigation
in
his
demand
,
as
it
was
not
a
debt
contracted
for
value
received
,
but
incurred
without
subjecting
him
to
the
least
damage
or
inconvenience
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
no
sooner
received
this
letter
,
than
he
went
in
person
to
wait
upon
the
author
,
to
whom
he
,
in
a
candid
manner
,
related
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
match
,
together
with
the
ingratitude
and
audacity
of
his
son
,
which
he
owned
had
stimulated
him
to
such
measures
as
he
,
otherwise
,
would
have
scorned
to
take
.
<EOS>
The
nobleman
acknowledged
,
that
the
revenge
was
hardly
adequate
to
the
provocation
,
and
condemned
the
conduct
of
his
son
with
such
justice
and
integrity
,
as
disarmed
Peregrine
of
his
resentment
,
and
disposed
him
to
give
an
undoubted
proof
of
his
own
disinterestedness
,
which
he
immediately
exhibited
,
by
producing
the
note
,
and
tearing
it
to
pieces
,
after
having
assured
his
lordship
,
that
the
writ
should
be
withdrawn
,
and
the
prisoner
discharged
before
night
.
    
<EOS>
The
earl
,
who
perfectly
well
understood
the
value
of
money
,
and
was
no
stranger
to
the
characters
of
mankind
,
stood
amazed
at
this
sacrifice
which
Pickle
protested
was
offered
by
his
esteem
for
his
lordship
;
and
after
having
complimented
him
upon
his
generosity
,
in
a
very
uncommon
strain
of
encomium
,
begg'd
<EOS>
the
favour
of
his
acquaintance
,
and
insisted
upon
his
dining
with
him
next
day
.
    
<EOS>
The
youth
,
proud
of
having
met
with
such
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
,
in
less
than
an
hour
performed
every
article
of
his
promise
;
and
in
the
morning
was
visited
by
the
debtor
,
who
came
,
by
the
express
order
of
his
father
,
to
thank
him
for
the
obligation
under
which
he
was
laid
,
and
ask
pardon
for
the
offence
he
had
given
.
    
<EOS>
This
condescension
was
very
glorious
for
our
hero
,
who
graciously
received
his
submission
,
and
accompanied
him
to
dinner
,
where
he
was
caressed
by
the
old
earl
with
marks
of
particular
affection
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
gratitude
confined
to
exterior
civility
;
he
offered
him
the
use
of
his
interest
at
court
,
which
was
very
powerful
,
and
repeated
his
desire
of
serving
him
so
pressingly
,
that
Peregrine
thought
he
could
not
dispense
with
the
opportunity
of
assisting
his
absent
friend
Godfrey
,
in
whose
behalf
he
begg'd
the
influence
of
his
lordship
.
    
<EOS>
The
earl
,
pleased
with
this
request
,
which
was
another
proof
of
the
young
gentleman
's
benevolence
,
said
,
he
would
not
fail
to
pay
the
utmost
regard
to
his
recommendation
;
and
in
six
weeks
a
captain
's
commission
was
actually
signed
for
the
brother
of
Emilia
,
who
was
very
agreeably
surprized
at
the
intimation
he
received
from
the
war
-
office
,
though
he
was
utterly
ignorant
of
the
canal
through
which
he
obtained
that
promotion
.

Chapter
XCIII
Peregrine
is
celebrated
as
a
wit
and
patron
,
and
proceeds
to
entertain
himself
at
the
expence
of
whom
it
did
concern
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Peregrine
flourished
in
the
gay
scenes
of
life
,
and
(
as
I
have
already
observed
)
had
divers
opportunities
of
profiting
in
the
way
of
marriage
,
had
not
his
ambition
been
a
little
too
inordinate
,
and
his
heart
still
biassed
by
a
passion
,
which
all
the
levity
of
youth
could
not
balance
,
nor
all
the
pride
of
vanity
overcome
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
our
hero
unmarked
in
the
world
of
letters
and
taste
:
he
had
signalized
himself
in
several
poetical
productions
,
by
which
he
had
acquired
a
good
share
of
reputation
;
not
that
the
pieces
were
such
as
ought
to
have
done
much
honour
to
his
genius
;
but
any
tolerable
performance
from
a
person
of
his
figure
and
supposed
fortune
,
will
always
be
considered
,
by
the
bulk
of
readers
,
as
an
instance
of
astonishing
capacity
;
though
the
very
same
production
,
ushered
into
the
world
with
the
name
of
an
author
in
less
affluent
circumstances
,
would
be
justly
disregarded
and
despised
;
so
much
is
the
opinion
of
most
people
influenced
and
over
-
awed
by
ridiculous
considerations
.
    
<EOS>
Be
this
as
it
will
,
our
young
gentleman
was
no
sooner
distinguished
as
an
author
,
than
he
was
marked
out
as
a
patron
,
by
all
the
starving
retainers
to
poetry
:
he
was
solemnized
in
odes
,
celebrated
in
epigrams
,
and
fed
with
the
milk
of
soft
dedication
.
<EOS>
His
vanity
even
relished
this
incense
;
and
though
his
reason
could
not
help
despising
those
that
offered
it
,
not
one
of
them
was
sent
away
,
unowned
by
his
munificence
.
<EOS>
He
began
to
think
himself
,
in
good
earnest
,
that
superior
genius
which
their
flattery
had
described
;
he
cultivated
acquaintance
with
the
wits
of
fashion
,
and
even
composed
in
secret
a
number
of
bons
mots
,
which
he
uttered
in
company
as
the
impromptu
's
of
his
imagination
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
practice
indeed
,
he
imitated
some
of
the
most
renowned
geniuses
of
the
age
,
who
(
if
the
truth
were
known
)
have
laboured
in
secret
,
with
the
sweat
of
their
brows
,
for
many
a
repartee
which
they
have
vended
as
the
immediate
production
of
fancy
and
expression
.
<EOS>
He
was
so
successful
in
this
exercise
of
his
talents
,
that
his
fame
actually
came
in
competition
with
that
of
a
great
man
,
who
had
long
sat
at
the
helm
of
wit
;
and
in
a
dialogue
that
once
happened
between
them
,
on
the
subject
of
a
cork
-
screw
,
wherein
the
altercation
was
discharged
(
according
to
Bayes
)
slap
for
slap
,
dash
for
dash
,
our
hero
was
judged
to
have
the
better
of
his
lordship
,
by
some
of
the
minor
satellites
,
that
commonly
surround
and
reflect
the
rays
of
such
mighty
luminaries
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
he
dipped
himself
so
far
in
these
literary
amusements
,
that
he
took
the
management
of
the
pit
into
his
direction
,
putting
himself
at
the
head
of
those
critics
who
call
themselves
the
town
;
and
in
that
capacity
chastised
several
players
,
who
had
been
rendered
insolent
and
refractory
by
unmerited
success
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
new
productions
of
the
stage
,
though
generally
unspirited
and
insipid
,
they
always
enjoyed
the
benefit
of
his
influence
and
protection
;
because
he
never
disliked
the
performance
so
much
as
he
sympathized
with
the
poor
author
,
who
stood
behind
the
scenes
in
the
most
dreadful
suspence
,
trembling
,
as
it
were
,
on
the
very
brink
of
damnation
:
<EOS>
yet
,
though
he
extended
his
generosity
and
compassion
to
the
humble
and
needy
,
he
never
let
slip
one
opportunity
of
mortifying
villainy
and
arrogance
.
<EOS>
Had
the
executive
power
of
the
legislature
been
vested
in
him
,
he
would
have
doubtless
devised
strange
species
of
punishment
for
all
offenders
against
humanity
and
decorum
;
but
,
restricted
as
he
was
,
he
employed
his
invention
in
subjecting
them
to
the
ridicule
and
contempt
of
their
fellow
-
subjects
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
with
that
view
he
set
on
foot
the
scheme
of
conjuration
,
<EOS>
which
was
still
happily
carried
on
,
and
made
use
of
the
intelligence
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
;
though
he
sometimes
converted
this
advantage
to
the
purposes
of
gallantry
,
being
(
as
the
reader
may
have
perceived
)
of
a
very
amorous
complexion
.
<EOS>
He
not
only
acted
the
reformer
,
or
rather
the
castigator
,
in
the
fashionable
world
,
but
also
exercised
his
talents
among
the
inferior
class
of
people
,
who
chanced
to
incur
his
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
Being
one
day
insulted
by
a
couple
of
chairmen
,
who
demanded
more
than
their
fare
,
he
took
particular
notice
of
their
number
;
and
next
day
,
Pipes
,
being
dressed
in
one
of
his
old
suits
,
went
by
his
direction
to
a
coffee
-
house
near
their
stand
,
after
he
had
loaded
himself
with
an
additional
weight
,
amounting
to
an
hundred
pounds
at
least
;
and
calling
the
same
individual
partners
who
had
affronted
his
master
<EOS>
,
he
took
possession
of
their
chair
,
and
ordered
them
to
carry
him
to
a
place
at
the
distance
of
two
long
miles
.
<EOS>
The
burthen
was
so
extraordinary
,
that
when
they
attempted
to
take
him
up
,
they
imagined
the
vehicle
was
detained
by
some
crack
or
crevice
of
the
pavement
,
and
one
of
them
actually
went
to
disengage
it
;
but
finding
it
clear
,
he
began
a
song
of
imprecations
upon
his
fare
,
who
he
swore
had
got
a
backside
of
block
-
tin
;
but
,
being
obliged
to
accomplish
his
undertaking
,
he
bent
his
shoulders
once
more
to
the
load
,
bidding
his
comrade
lift
fair
and
be
damn'd
.
    
<EOS>
The
task
was
not
performed
in
silence
;
while
they
staggered
along
,
he
cursed
in
a
strain
peculiar
to
himself
,
and
in
vain
endeavoured
to
provoke
the
patient
Pipes
with
opprobrious
language
,
hoping
that
he
would
either
dismiss
them
from
his
service
,
or
be
so
incensed
at
his
abuse
,
as
to
proceed
to
manual
chastisement
;
in
which
case
,
the
fellow
would
have
an
opportunity
of
gratifying
his
choler
upon
the
author
of
his
present
grievance
.
<EOS>
Finding
,
however
,
that
the
gentleman
bore
his
reproaches
with
the
most
philosophic
indifference
,
he
lost
all
patience
;
and
being
restrained
,
by
the
fear
of
the
law
,
from
an
assault
upon
his
fare
,
he
turned
the
stream
of
his
indignation
upon
his
own
partner
,
who
,
he
alledged
,
did
not
bear
his
share
of
the
burthen
.
<EOS>
This
imputation
created
a
dispute
,
which
was
maintained
on
both
sides
with
such
virulence
of
obloquy
,
as
produced
a
quarrel
,
and
mutual
defiance
to
single
combat
,
on
the
spot
.
    
<EOS>
The
chair
was
accordingly
set
down
,
without
ceremony
,
the
antagonists
stripped
themselves
in
a
moment
;
and
a
fierce
battle
ensuing
,
Peregrine
,
who
followed
at
a
distance
,
enjoyed
the
pleasure
of
seeing
them
both
beaten
almost
to
jelly
,
before
the
contest
was
determined
.
<EOS>
As
for
Pipes
,
he
sat
still
,
and
viewed
the
engagement
with
great
composure
;
and
perceiving
his
carriers
disabled
by
their
mutual
prowess
and
perseverance
,
opened
the
chair
,
and
very
deliberately
walked
home
to
his
master
's
lodging
,
where
he
disincumbered
himself
of
his
load
.
    
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
the
atchievement
of
this
exploit
,
one
of
our
hero
's
friends
,
who
lodged
at
the
house
of
an
old
peevish
puritanical
widow
,
that
kept
an
hosier
's
shop
,
was
obliged
to
quit
his
apartment
at
a
minute
's
warning
,
because
he
had
scandalized
the
house
,
by
treating
a
female
cousin
at
supper
over
-
night
.
    
<EOS>
On
this
occasion
,
a
great
deal
of
sharp
repartee
had
passed
between
him
and
his
landlady
,
who
not
only
subjected
him
to
infinite
inconvenience
,
from
such
a
precipitate
removal
,
but
had
likewise
given
her
tongue
such
disagreeable
liberties
,
at
his
expence
,
that
he
vowed
revenge
,
and
now
sollicited
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
friend
.
<EOS>
Pickle
having
inquired
into
the
character
of
the
delinquent
,
who
was
hated
by
her
neighbours
,
for
her
insolent
and
fretful
disposition
,
undertook
the
cause
of
his
companion
,
to
whom
he
dictated
the
following
advertisement
,
which
was
immediately
inserted
in
one
of
the
news
-
papers
:
"
Any
person
possessed
of
a
male
black
cat
,
with
white
feet
,
and
a
bushy
tail
,
not
exceeding
the
age
of
two
or
three
years
,
will
find
a
purchaser
,
by
carrying
it
to
the
sign
of
the
kid
near
St
James
's
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
projector
and
his
associate
having
obtained
the
promise
of
the
publisher
,
that
this
intimation
should
appear
next
day
,
went
early
in
the
morning
to
a
public
house
,
and
occupying
a
room
,
the
windows
of
which
fronted
the
hosier
's
door
,
sat
with
joyful
expectation
to
see
the
effect
of
their
scheme
,
which
soon
yielded
them
all
the
satisfaction
they
could
desire
.
<EOS>
The
shop
was
no
sooner
opened
,
than
it
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
the
Cannaille
,
who
having
heard
the
advertisement
read
in
ale
-
houses
,
came
(
each
with
a
cat
under
his
arm
)
in
hopes
of
making
an
advantageous
bargain
;
for
though
many
of
them
were
too
inconsiderable
to
produce
such
an
animal
of
their
own
property
,
they
had
made
free
with
the
first
cats
they
could
pick
up
,
and
every
one
repaired
with
all
possible
dispatch
to
the
appointed
place
,
with
a
view
of
forestalling
the
market
;
so
that
,
in
disputing
the
precedence
,
the
whole
crew
went
to
loggerheads
about
the
door
,
to
the
utter
astonishment
of
the
shopkeeper
,
who
could
not
conceive
the
meaning
of
such
a
congregation
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
began
to
harangue
them
in
her
usual
stile
,
which
was
not
the
mildest
sort
of
expostulation
;
and
one
of
the
multitude
,
who
found
means
to
detach
himself
from
the
general
uproar
and
confusion
,
told
her
,
he
had
brought
a
cat
,
which
,
he
supposed
,
would
answer
the
marks
of
her
advertisement
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
,
(
said
he
,
presenting
the
creature
)
<EOS>
look
at
him
,
mistress
;
I
'll
be
damn'd
<EOS>
if
you
ever
saw
a
finer
boar
in
your
life
.
<EOS>
Do
but
mind
his
tusks
and
his
tail
;
his
tail
is
for
all
the
world
like
a
squirrel
's
,
and
yet
he
's
no
more
than
a
kitten
;
I
'm
the
son
of
a
bitch
,
if
he
's
a
day
more
than
six
months
old
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
address
,
while
it
compleated
her
amazement
,
kindled
her
rage
to
such
a
degree
,
that
she
spit
in
his
face
,
calling
him
a
cat
,
and
a
rat
,
and
a
rascal
;
and
shutting
the
hatch
,
threatened
the
whole
assembly
with
Bridewell
and
imprisonment
,
if
they
would
not
immediately
disperse
.
<EOS>
Her
declamation
was
so
shrill
,
as
to
command
the
attention
of
the
whole
audience
,
who
finding
their
hopes
frustrated
,
and
hearing
themselves
so
bitterly
reviled
,
put
an
end
to
their
own
jars
,
and
held
a
momentary
conference
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
one
of
them
was
deputed
to
ask
,
whether
or
not
she
had
advertised
for
a
black
cat
.
<EOS>
This
question
being
answered
in
the
negative
,
with
a
string
of
reproachful
epithets
,
the
interrogator
approaching
the
door
,
"
Why
,
ye
bitch
of
Babel
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
if
you
wo
n't
give
money
for
my
cat
,
you
shall
have
him
for
love
.
"
    
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
threw
it
into
the
shop
,
and
retired
;
while
his
brethren
,
in
obedience
to
this
signal
,
lifted
up
their
hands
as
one
man
,
and
like
soldiers
at
the
word
of
command
,
discharged
about
forty
cats
at
the
same
instant
of
time
,
upon
the
confounded
hosier
,
who
finding
herself
overwhelmed
by
such
a
number
of
animals
,
which
she
looked
upon
as
so
many
fiends
sent
to
torment
her
,
ran
aghast
into
the
street
with
dismal
outcries
,
imploring
the
assistance
of
her
neighbours
,
who
(
as
well
as
our
confederates
)
enjoyed
her
distress
;
and
after
having
indulged
their
animosity
,
contributed
their
aid
,
in
ridding
her
of
such
a
dangerous
annoyance
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
mischievous
plan
that
entered
our
hero
's
imagination
,
was
suggested
by
two
advertisements
published
in
the
same
paper
,
by
persons
who
wanted
to
borrow
certain
sums
of
money
,
for
which
they
promised
to
give
undeniable
security
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
from
the
stile
and
manner
of
both
,
concluded
they
were
written
by
attornies
,
a
species
of
people
for
whom
he
entertained
his
uncle
's
aversion
:
and
in
order
to
amuse
himself
,
and
some
of
his
friends
,
with
their
disappointment
,
he
wrote
a
letter
signed
A%
B
to
each
advertiser
,
according
to
the
address
specified
in
the
news
-
paper
,
importing
,
that
if
he
would
come
with
his
writings
,
to
a
certain
coffee
-
house
near
the
Temple
,
precisely
at
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
he
would
find
a
person
sitting
in
the
right
-
hand
box
,
next
to
the
window
,
who
would
be
glad
to
treat
with
him
about
the
subject
of
his
advertisement
,
and
,
should
his
security
be
liked
,
would
accommodate
him
with
the
sum
which
he
wanted
to
raise
.
<EOS>
Before
the
hour
of
this
double
appointment
,
Pickle
with
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
and
a
few
more
gentlemen
,
to
whom
he
had
thought
proper
to
communicate
the
plan
,
went
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
seated
themselves
near
the
place
that
was
destined
for
their
meeting
.
    
<EOS>
The
hope
of
getting
money
had
such
an
evident
effect
upon
their
punctuality
,
that
one
of
them
arrived
a
considerable
time
before
the
hour
;
and
having
reconnoitred
the
room
,
took
his
station
according
to
the
direction
he
had
received
,
fixing
his
eye
upon
a
clock
that
stood
before
him
,
and
asking
of
the
bar
-
keeper
if
it
was
not
too
slow
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
remained
in
this
posture
many
minutes
,
when
he
was
joined
by
a
strange
figure
,
that
waddled
into
the
room
,
with
a
bundle
of
papers
in
his
bosom
,
and
the
sweat
running
over
his
nose
.
<EOS>
Seeing
a
man
in
the
box
to
which
he
had
been
directed
,
he
took
it
for
granted
<EOS>
he
was
the
lender
;
and
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
his
breath
,
which
was
almost
exhausted
by
the
dispatch
he
had
made
,
"
Sir
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
presume
you
are
the
gentleman
I
was
to
meet
,
about
that
loan
.
<EOS>
"
  
<EOS>
Here
he
was
interrupted
by
the
other
,
who
eagerly
replied
,
"
A%
B.
Sir
,
I
suppose
.
"
<EOS>
"
The
same
,
(
cried
the
last
comer
)
<EOS>
I
was
afraid
I
should
be
too
late
;
for
I
was
detained
beyond
my
expectation
,
by
a
nobleman
in
the
other
end
of
the
town
,
that
wants
to
mortgage
a
small
trifle
of
his
estate
,
about
a
thousand
a
year
;
and
my
watch
happens
to
be
in
the
hands
of
the
maker
,
having
met
with
an
accident
a
few
nights
ago
,
which
set
it
asleep
.
<EOS>
But
howsomever
,
there
's
no
time
lost
,
and
I
hope
this
affair
will
be
transacted
to
the
satisfaction
of
us
both
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
love
to
do
good
offices
myself
,
and
therefore
I
expect
nothing
<EOS>
but
what
is
fair
and
honest
of
other
people
.
"
    
<EOS>
His
new
friend
was
exceedingly
comforted
by
this
declaration
,
which
he
considered
as
a
happy
omen
of
his
success
;
and
the
hope
of
fingering
the
cash
operated
visibly
in
his
countenance
,
while
he
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
meeting
with
a
person
of
such
candour
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
"
The
pleasure
(
said
he
)
of
dealing
with
an
easy
conscientious
man
,
is
,
in
my
opinion
,
superior
to
that
of
touching
all
the
money
upon
earth
;
for
what
joy
can
be
compared
with
what
a
generous
mind
feels
,
in
befriending
its
fellow
-
creatures
?
<EOS>
I
was
never
so
happy
in
my
life
,
as
at
one
time
,
in
lending
five
hundred
pounds
to
a
worthy
gentleman
in
distress
,
without
insisting
upon
rigid
security
.
<EOS>
Sir
,
one
may
easily
distinguish
an
upright
man
by
his
countenance
;
for
example
now
,
I
think
I
could
take
your
word
for
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
The
other
with
great
joy
protested
,
that
he
was
right
in
his
conjecture
,
and
returned
the
compliment
a
thousand
fold
:
by
which
means
,
the
expectation
of
both
was
wound
up
to
a
very
interesting
pitch
;
and
both
,
at
the
same
instant
,
began
to
produce
their
papers
,
in
the
untying
of
which
,
their
hands
shook
with
transports
of
eagerness
and
impatience
;
while
their
eyes
were
so
intent
upon
their
work
,
that
they
did
not
perceive
the
occupation
of
each
other
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
one
of
them
,
having
got
the
start
of
the
other
,
and
unrolled
several
skins
of
musty
parchment
,
directed
his
view
to
the
employment
of
his
friend
;
and
seeing
him
fumbling
at
his
bundle
,
asked
if
that
was
a
blank
bond
and
conveyance
,
which
he
had
brought
along
with
him
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
without
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
or
desisting
from
his
endeavours
to
loose
the
knot
,
which
by
this
time
he
had
applied
to
his
teeth
,
answered
this
question
in
the
negative
,
observing
,
that
the
papers
in
his
hand
were
the
security
which
he
proposed
to
give
for
the
money
.
    
<EOS>
This
reply
converted
the
looks
of
the
inquirer
into
a
stare
of
infinite
stolidity
,
accompanied
with
the
word
,
Anan
!
<EOS>
which
he
pronounced
in
a
tone
of
fear
and
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
other
,
alarmed
at
this
note
,
cast
his
eyes
towards
the
supposed
lender
,
and
was
in
a
moment
infected
by
his
aspect
.
<EOS>
All
the
exultation
of
hope
that
sparkled
in
their
eyes
,
was
now
succeeded
by
disappointment
and
dismay
;
and
while
they
gazed
ruefully
at
each
other
,
their
features
were
gradually
elongated
,
like
the
transient
curls
of
a
Middle
-
row
periwig
.
    
<EOS>
This
emphatic
silence
was
,
however
,
broke
by
the
last
comer
,
who
,
in
a
faultering
accent
,
desired
the
other
to
recollect
the
contents
of
his
letter
.
<EOS>
"
Of
your
letter
!
"
cried
the
first
,
putting
into
his
hand
the
advertisement
he
had
received
from
Pickle
;
which
he
had
no
sooner
perused
,
than
he
produced
his
own
,
for
the
satisfaction
of
the
other
party
:
so
that
another
gloomy
pause
ensued
,
at
the
end
of
which
,
each
uttered
a
profound
sigh
,
or
rather
groan
,
and
rising
up
,
sneak'd
off
,
without
farther
communication
;
he
who
seemed
to
be
the
most
afflicted
of
the
two
,
taking
his
departure
,
with
an
exclamation
of
"
Humbugged
,
egad
!
"
    
<EOS>
Such
were
the
amusements
of
our
hero
,
tho
'
<EOS>
they
did
not
engross
his
whole
time
,
some
part
of
which
was
dedicated
to
nocturnal
riots
and
revels
,
among
a
set
of
young
noblemen
,
who
had
denounced
war
against
temperance
,
oeconomy
,
and
common
sense
,
and
were
indeed
the
devoted
sons
of
tumult
,
waste
,
and
prodigality
.
    
<EOS>
Not
that
Peregrine
relished
those
scenes
,
which
were
a
succession
of
absurd
extravagance
,
devoid
of
all
true
spirit
,
taste
,
or
enjoyment
:
but
his
vanity
prompted
him
to
mingle
with
those
who
were
intitled
the
choice
spirits
of
the
age
;
and
his
disposition
was
so
pliable
,
as
to
adapt
itself
easily
to
the
measures
of
his
company
,
where
he
had
not
influence
enough
to
act
in
the
capacity
of
director
.
<EOS>
The
rendezvous
was
at
a
certain
tavern
,
which
might
be
properly
stiled
the
temple
of
excess
,
where
they
left
the
choice
of
their
fare
to
the
discretion
of
the
landlord
,
that
they
might
save
themselves
the
pains
of
exercising
their
own
reason
;
and
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
trouble
of
adjusting
the
bill
,
ordered
the
waiter
to
declare
how
much
every
individual
must
pay
,
without
specifying
the
articles
of
the
charge
;
and
this
proportion
generally
amounted
to
two
guineas
per
head
for
each
dinner
and
supper
,
and
frequently
exceeded
that
sum
;
of
which
the
landlord
durst
not
abate
,
without
running
the
risque
of
having
his
nose
slit
for
his
moderation
.
    
<EOS>
But
this
was
a
puny
expence
,
compared
with
that
which
they
often
incurred
,
by
the
damage
done
to
the
furniture
and
servants
,
in
the
madness
of
their
intoxication
,
as
well
as
the
loss
they
sustained
at
hazard
,
an
amusement
to
which
all
of
them
had
recourse
,
in
the
progress
of
their
debauches
.
<EOS>
This
elegant
diversion
was
introduced
,
encouraged
,
and
promoted
by
a
crew
of
rapacious
sharpers
,
who
had
made
themselves
necessary
companions
to
this
hopeful
generation
,
by
the
talents
of
pimping
and
buffoonery
:
and
though
they
were
universally
known
,
even
by
those
they
preyed
upon
,
to
have
no
other
means
of
earning
their
livelihood
,
than
the
most
infamous
and
fraudulent
practices
,
they
were
caressed
and
courted
by
these
infatuated
dupes
,
when
a
man
of
honour
,
who
would
not
join
in
their
excesses
,
would
have
been
treated
with
the
utmost
indignity
and
contempt
.
    
<EOS>
Though
Peregrine
,
in
his
heart
,
detested
those
abandoned
courses
,
and
was
a
professed
enemy
to
the
whole
society
of
gamesters
,
whom
he
considered
,
and
always
treated
as
the
foes
of
human
kind
,
he
was
insensibly
accustomed
to
licentious
riot
,
and
even
led
imperceptibly
into
play
by
those
cormorants
,
who
are
no
less
dangerous
in
the
art
of
cheating
,
than
by
their
consummate
skill
in
working
upon
the
passions
of
unwary
youth
.
<EOS>
They
are
,
for
the
most
part
,
naturally
cool
,
phlegmatic
and
crafty
,
and
by
a
long
habit
of
dissimulation
,
have
gained
an
absolute
dominion
over
the
hasty
passions
of
the
heart
;
so
that
they
engage
with
manifest
advantage
over
the
impatience
and
impetuosity
of
a
warm
,
undesigning
temper
,
like
that
of
our
young
gentleman
,
who
,
when
he
was
heated
with
wine
,
misled
by
example
,
invited
on
one
hand
,
and
defied
on
the
other
,
forgot
all
his
maxims
of
caution
and
sobriety
,
and
plunging
into
the
reigning
folly
of
the
place
,
had
frequent
occasions
to
moralize
in
the
morning
,
upon
the
loss
of
the
preceding
night
.
    
<EOS>
These
penitential
reflections
were
attended
with
many
laudable
resolutions
of
profiting
by
the
expence
which
he
had
so
dearly
purchased
;
but
he
was
one
of
those
philosophers
,
who
always
put
off
,
till
another
day
,
the
commencement
of
their
reformation
.

Chapter

Peregrine
receives
a
letter
from
Hatchway
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
repairs
to
the
garison
,
and
performs
the
last
offices
to
his
aunt
.
<EOS>
He
is
visited
by
Mr
Gauntlet
,
who
invites
him
to
his
marriage
.
   
<EOS>
In
this
circle
of
amusements
our
hero
's
time
was
parcelled
out
,
and
few
young
gentlemen
of
the
age
enjoyed
life
with
greater
relish
,
notwithstanding
those
intervening
checks
of
reason
,
which
served
only
to
whet
his
appetite
for
a
repetition
of
the
pleasures
she
so
prudently
condemned
;
when
he
received
the
following
letter
,
by
which
he
was
determined
to
visit
his
estate
in
the
country
.
    
<EOS>
Cousin
Pickle
,
I
hope
you
are
in
a
better
trim
than
your
aunt
,
who
hath
been
fast
moored
to
her
bed
these
seven
weeks
,
by
several
feet
of
under
-
water
logging
in
her
hold
and
hollop
,
<EOS>
whereby
I
doubt
her
planks
are
rotted
,
so
as
she
can
not
chuse
but
fall
to
pieces
in
a
short
time
.
<EOS>
I
have
done
all
in
my
power
to
keep
her
tight
and
easy
,
and
free
from
sudden
squalls
that
might
overstrain
her
.
<EOS>
And
here
have
been
the
doctors
,
who
have
skuttled
her
lower
deck
,
and
let
out
six
gallons
water
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
wonder
how
the
devil
it
came
there
;
for
you
know
as
how
it
was
a
liquor
she
never
took
in
.
<EOS>
But
as
for
those
fellows
the
doctors
,
they
are
like
unskilful
carpenters
,
that
in
mending
one
leak
,
make
a
couple
;
and
so
she
fills
again
apace
.
<EOS>
But
the
worst
sign
of
all
is
this
here
,
she
wo
n't
let
a
drop
of
Nantz
go
betwixt
<EOS>
the
combings
of
her
teeth
,
and
has
quite
lost
the
rudder
of
her
understanding
,
whereby
she
yaws
woundily
in
her
speech
,
palavering
about
some
foreign
part
called
the
New
Geereusalem
,
and
wishing
herself
in
a
safe
birth
in
the
river
Geordun
.
<EOS>
The
parson
,
I
must
say
,
strives
to
keep
her
steady
,
concerning
the
navigation
of
her
soul
,
and
talks
very
sensibly
of
charity
and
the
poor
,
whereof
<EOS>
she
hath
left
a
legacy
of
two
hundred
pounds
in
her
will
.
<EOS>
And
here
has
been
Mr
Gamaliel
and
your
brother
my
lord
,
demanding
entrance
at
the
gate
,
in
order
to
see
her
;
but
I
would
not
suffer
them
to
come
aboard
,
and
pointed
my
patereroes
,
which
made
them
sheer
off
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
Mrs
Clover
keeps
close
watch
upon
her
kinswoman
,
without
ever
turning
in
,
and
a
kind
-
hearted
young
woman
it
is
.
    
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
see
you
at
the
garison
,
if
the
wind
of
your
inclination
sits
that
way
;
and
mayhap
it
may
be
a
comfort
to
your
aunt
,
to
behold
you
along
-
side
of
her
,
when
her
anchor
is
speak
.
<EOS>
So
no
more
at
present
,
but
rests
 
Your
friend
And
humble
servant
to
command
,
Jno
Hatchway
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
,
after
the
receipt
of
this
epistle
,
Peregrine
,
in
order
to
manifest
his
regard
to
his
aunt
,
as
well
as
his
friendship
for
honest
Jack
,
set
out
on
horseback
for
their
habitation
,
attended
by
Pipes
,
who
longed
to
see
his
old
messmate
;
but
,
before
he
reached
the
garison
,
Mrs
Hatchway
had
given
up
the
ghost
,
in
the
threescore
and
fifth
year
of
her
age
.
<EOS>
The
widower
seemed
to
bear
his
loss
with
resignation
,
and
behaved
very
decently
upon
the
occasion
,
though
he
did
not
undergo
those
dangerous
transports
of
sorrow
,
which
some
tender
-
hearted
husbands
have
felt
at
the
departure
of
their
yoke
-
fellows
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
was
naturally
a
philosopher
,
and
so
well
disposed
to
acquiesce
in
the
dispensations
of
providence
,
that
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
every
other
emergency
of
his
life
,
he
firmly
believed
,
that
every
thing
which
happened
was
for
the
best
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
task
,
therefore
,
was
not
so
great
in
comforting
him
,
as
in
consoling
his
own
sister
,
who
with
great
poignancy
and
sincerity
of
grief
,
lamented
the
death
of
the
only
relation
with
whom
she
had
maintained
any
intimacy
of
correspondence
;
for
her
mother
was
as
implacable
as
ever
,
in
her
enmity
against
her
and
Peregrine
,
and
rather
more
determined
in
her
rancour
,
that
which
was
originally
a
sudden
transport
of
indignation
,
being
by
this
time
settled
into
a
confirmed
inveteracy
of
hate
.
<EOS>
As
for
Gam
,
who
was
now
dignified
by
the
country
-
people
with
the
appellation
of
the
young
squire
,
he
still
acted
in
the
capacity
of
minister
to
the
caprice
and
vengeance
of
his
mother
,
taking
all
opportunities
of
disturbing
Julia
's
peace
,
slandering
her
reputation
,
and
committing
outrages
against
the
tenants
and
domestics
of
her
husband
,
who
was
a
man
of
a
quiet
and
timorous
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
chief
amusement
of
young
Pickle
,
in
his
later
years
,
was
the
chace
,
in
which
he
acquired
some
renown
by
his
intrepidity
and
remarkable
figure
,
which
improved
every
day
in
deformity
;
insomuch
,
as
to
suggest
a
ludicrous
scheme
of
revenge
to
a
gentleman
in
the
neighbourhood
,
who
having
been
affronted
by
the
insolence
of
Crookback
,
cloathed
a
large
baboon
that
was
in
his
possession
,
in
a
dress
that
resembled
the
hunting
-
equipage
of
Gam
;
and
ordering
the
animal
to
be
set
astride
,
and
tied
upon
the
back
of
his
keenest
hunter
,
turned
them
out
one
day
after
the
hounds
;
and
the
horse
in
a
little
time
outstripping
all
the
rest
in
the
field
,
the
rider
was
mistaken
for
Gam
by
the
whole
company
,
who
saluted
him
as
he
passed
with
a
hollow
,
observing
,
that
the
squire
had
his
usual
good
luck
,
in
being
better
mounted
than
his
neighbours
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
afterwards
appearing
in
his
own
person
,
created
great
astonishment
in
the
spectators
,
one
of
whom
asked
if
he
had
split
himself
in
twain
,
and
pointed
out
his
representative
,
who
was
by
this
time
almost
up
with
the
hounds
:
upon
which
,
the
identical
Gam
went
in
pursuit
of
the
impostor
;
and
when
he
overtook
him
was
so
much
enraged
at
the
counterfeit
,
that
he
attacked
the
baboon
whip
in
hand
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
would
have
sacrificed
him
to
his
resentment
,
had
not
he
been
prevented
by
the
other
foxhunters
,
who
interposed
,
in
order
to
make
up
the
difference
betwixt
two
brothers
of
the
sport
,
and
were
equally
surprised
and
diverted
,
when
they
distinguished
the
quality
of
Crookback
's
antagonist
,
which
they
rescued
from
his
rage
,
and
reconveyed
to
its
master
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
at
the
request
of
his
friend
Jack
,
took
charge
of
his
aunt
's
funeral
,
to
which
his
parents
were
invited
,
though
they
did
not
think
proper
to
appear
,
or
pay
the
least
regard
to
his
sollicitations
,
when
he
desired
permission
to
wait
upon
them
in
person
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
old
Gamaliel
,
at
the
instigation
of
his
wife
,
afterwards
obtained
an
order
from
Doctor
's
Commons
,
obliging
Hatchway
to
produce
the
will
of
his
wife
,
on
the
supposition
that
she
had
bequeathed
to
him
some
part
of
the
money
which
(
she
knew
)
was
at
her
own
disposal
.
<EOS>
But
from
this
step
he
reaped
no
other
satisfaction
than
that
of
finding
himself
altogether
neglected
by
the
testatrix
,
who
had
left
all
her
effects
to
her
husband
,
except
one
thousand
pounds
,
with
her
jewels
,
to
Julia
's
daughter
,
the
benefaction
mentioned
in
the
lieutenant
's
letter
,
and
some
inconsiderable
legacies
to
her
favourite
domesticks
.
    
<EOS>
A
few
days
after
the
interment
of
this
good
lady
,
our
hero
was
agreeably
surprised
with
a
visit
from
his
friend
Godfrey
,
who
had
come
to
England
in
consequence
of
that
promotion
which
he
owed
to
his
interest
,
tho
'
the
soldier
himself
placed
it
to
the
credit
of
a
certain
courtier
who
had
formerly
promised
to
befriend
him
,
and
now
finding
his
advancement
unowned
,
very
modestly
arrogated
the
merit
of
it
to
himself
.
<EOS>
He
communicated
his
good
fortune
to
Pickle
,
who
complimented
him
upon
it
as
an
event
of
which
he
had
no
precognition
;
and
at
the
same
time
told
him
,
that
,
in
consequence
of
his
preferment
,
his
cousin
at
Windsor
had
consented
to
his
being
immediately
united
in
the
bands
of
wedlock
with
his
lovely
Sophy
;
that
the
wedding
-
day
was
already
fixed
;
and
that
nothing
would
be
wanting
to
his
happiness
,
if
Peregrine
would
honour
the
nuptials
with
his
presence
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
accepted
the
invitation
with
great
eagerness
,
when
he
learned
that
Emilia
would
be
there
in
quality
of
bride
's
maid
;
and
now
repeated
what
he
had
formerly
written
to
his
friend
,
namely
,
that
he
was
not
only
willing
,
but
extremely
impatient
to
attone
for
his
mad
behaviour
to
that
young
lady
,
by
laying
himself
and
his
whole
fortune
at
her
feet
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
thanked
him
for
his
honourable
intention
,
and
promised
to
use
his
influence
,
and
that
of
Sophy
,
in
his
behalf
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
seemed
dubious
of
their
success
,
on
account
of
his
sister
's
delicacy
,
which
could
not
pardon
the
least
shadow
of
disrespect
.
<EOS>
He
owned
,
indeed
,
he
was
not
certain
that
she
would
appear
in
the
same
company
with
Pickle
;
but
as
she
had
made
no
stipulations
on
that
score
,
he
would
interpret
her
silence
in
the
most
favourable
manner
,
and
keep
her
in
ignorance
of
his
design
,
until
she
should
find
it
too
late
to
retract
with
any
decency
.
    
<EOS>
The
hope
of
seeing
and
conversing
with
Emilia
,
and
perhaps
of
being
reconciled
to
her
,
after
having
suffered
so
much
and
so
long
from
her
displeasure
,
raised
a
tumult
of
ideas
in
his
breast
,
and
produced
a
strange
inquietude
of
joy
and
perturbation
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
having
stayed
with
him
a
few
days
,
and
signified
the
time
appointed
for
his
spousals
,
took
his
leave
,
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
occasion
;
while
Peregrine
,
with
his
friend
Hatchway
,
made
a
tour
among
his
acquaintance
in
the
country
,
with
a
view
of
sounding
their
inclinations
touching
a
project
which
he
had
lately
conceived
,
of
offering
himself
as
a
candidate
for
a
certain
borough
in
the
neighbourhood
,
at
the
ensuing
election
for
members
of
parliament
.
    
<EOS>
This
scheme
,
which
was
suggested
to
him
by
one
of
his
quality
patrons
,
would
have
succeeded
according
to
his
wish
,
had
the
election
taken
place
immediately
;
but
before
that
happened
,
his
interest
was
overbalanced
by
some
small
accidents
that
will
be
recorded
in
the
sequel
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
he
repaired
to
Windsor
on
the
eve
of
his
friend
's
marriage
,
and
understood
from
Godfrey
,
that
it
was
with
the
utmost
difficulty
he
and
Sophy
could
prevail
upon
his
sister
to
be
present
at
the
wedding
,
when
she
was
informed
that
her
lover
was
invited
,
and
that
her
consent
had
not
been
obtained
until
they
had
promised
,
on
the
part
of
Peregrine
,
that
he
should
not
renew
the
old
topic
,
nor
even
speak
to
her
in
the
stile
of
a
former
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
was
nettled
at
this
preliminary
,
to
which
,
however
,
he
said
he
would
adhere
;
and
so
well
did
he
think
himself
fortified
with
pride
and
resentment
,
that
he
resolved
to
behave
towards
her
with
such
indifference
,
as
would
,
he
hoped
,
mortify
her
vanity
,
and
thereby
punish
her
for
the
implacability
of
her
disposition
.
    
<EOS>
Armed
with
these
sentiments
,
he
was
next
day
introduced
by
Godfrey
to
the
bride
,
who
received
him
with
her
usual
sweetness
of
temper
and
affability
;
and
Emilia
being
present
,
he
saluted
her
with
a
distant
bow
,
which
she
acknowledged
with
a
cold
curt'sy
,
and
an
aspect
of
ice
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
this
deportment
confirmed
his
displeasure
,
her
beauty
undermined
his
resolution
;
he
thought
her
charms
were
infinitely
improved
since
their
last
parting
,
and
a
thousand
fond
images
recurring
to
his
imagination
,
he
felt
his
whole
soul
dissolving
into
tenderness
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
In
order
to
banish
those
dangerous
ideas
,
he
endeavoured
to
enter
into
a
gay
conversation
with
Sophy
,
on
the
subject
of
the
approaching
ceremony
;
but
his
tongue
performed
its
office
very
aukwardly
,
his
eyes
were
attracted
towards
Emilia
,
as
if
they
had
been
subject
to
the
power
of
fascination
;
in
spite
of
all
his
efforts
,
a
deep
sigh
escaped
from
his
bosom
,
and
his
whole
appearance
indicated
anxiety
and
confusion
.
    
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
perceiving
his
condition
,
abridged
the
visit
,
and
having
conducted
his
companion
to
his
own
lodgings
,
expressed
his
concern
at
having
been
the
innocent
occasion
of
his
uneasiness
,
by
exposing
him
to
the
sight
of
Emilia
,
which
he
perceived
had
given
him
pain
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
had
by
this
time
recollected
the
dictates
of
his
pride
,
assured
him
,
that
he
was
very
much
mistaken
in
the
cause
of
his
disorder
,
which
was
no
other
than
a
sudden
qualm
,
to
which
he
had
been
for
some
time
subject
;
and
to
shew
him
how
philosophically
he
could
bear
the
disdain
of
Emilia
,
which
,
with
all
deference
to
her
conduct
,
he
could
not
help
thinking
a
little
too
severe
,
he
desired
,
as
the
bridegroom
had
made
preparations
for
a
private
ball
in
the
evening
,
that
he
would
provide
him
with
an
agreeable
partner
;
in
which
case
he
would
exhibit
undoubted
proofs
of
the
tranquillity
of
his
heart
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
in
hopes
(
answered
Godfrey
)
of
being
able
,
with
the
assistance
of
Sophy
,
to
make
up
matters
between
you
and
my
sister
,
and
for
that
reason
kept
her
unengaged
to
any
other
gentleman
for
the
night
;
but
since
she
is
so
peevishly
obstinate
,
I
shall
take
care
to
accommodate
you
with
a
very
handsome
young
lady
,
whose
partner
will
not
be
sorry
to
exchange
her
for
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
The
thoughts
of
having
an
opportunity
to
coquet
with
another
woman
,
under
the
eye
of
this
implacable
mistress
,
supported
his
spirits
during
the
ceremony
which
put
Gauntlet
in
possession
of
his
heart
's
desire
;
and
,
by
means
of
this
cordial
,
he
found
himself
so
undisturbed
at
dinner
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
sat
opposite
to
his
fair
enemy
,
that
he
was
able
to
pass
some
occasional
jokes
upon
the
new
-
married
couple
,
with
some
appearance
of
mirth
and
good
humour
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
Emily
any
otherwise
seem
affected
by
his
presence
,
than
by
excepting
him
from
the
participation
of
those
genial
regards
which
she
distributed
to
the
rest
of
the
company
.
<EOS>
This
easiness
of
behaviour
on
her
side
,
reinforced
his
resolution
,
by
giving
him
pretence
to
call
her
sensibility
in
question
;
for
he
could
not
conceive
how
any
woman
of
acute
feelings
could
sit
unmoved
,
in
presence
of
a
man
with
whom
she
had
such
recent
and
intimate
connexion
:
not
considering
,
that
she
had
much
more
reason
to
condemn
his
affectation
of
unconcern
,
and
that
her
external
deportment
might
,
like
his
own
,
be
an
effort
of
pride
and
resentment
.
    
<EOS>
This
contest
,
in
point
of
dissimulation
,
continued
till
night
,
when
the
company
was
paired
for
dancing
,
and
Peregrine
began
the
ball
by
walking
a
minuet
with
the
bride
;
then
he
took
out
the
young
lady
to
whom
he
was
recommended
by
Gauntlet
,
being
very
well
pleased
to
see
that
her
person
was
such
as
might
have
inspired
even
Emily
herself
with
jealousy
,
though
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
perceived
his
mistress
coupled
with
a
gay
young
officer
,
whom
(
with
all
due
deference
to
his
own
qualifications
)
he
considered
as
no
despicable
rival
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
himself
first
began
hostilities
,
by
becoming
all
of
a
sudden
particular
with
his
partner
,
whom
he
forthwith
assailed
with
flattering
compliments
,
that
soon
introduced
the
subject
of
love
,
upon
which
he
expatiated
with
great
art
and
elocution
,
using
not
only
the
faculty
of
speech
,
but
also
the
language
of
the
eyes
,
in
which
he
was
a
perfect
connoisseur
.
    
<EOS>
This
behaviour
soon
manifested
itself
to
the
whole
assembly
,
the
greatest
part
of
whom
believed
that
he
was
in
good
earnest
captivated
by
the
heart
of
his
partner
,
<EOS>
while
Emilia
,
penetrating
into
his
design
,
turned
his
own
artillery
upon
himself
,
by
seeming
to
listen
with
pleasure
to
the
addresses
of
his
rival
,
who
was
no
novice
in
the
art
of
making
love
:
she
even
affected
uncommon
vivacity
,
and
giggled
aloud
at
every
whisper
which
he
conveyed
into
her
ear
,
insomuch
that
she
,
in
her
turn
,
afforded
speculation
to
the
company
,
who
imagined
the
young
soldier
had
made
a
conquest
of
the
bridegroom
's
sister
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
himself
began
to
cherish
the
same
opinion
,
which
gradually
invaded
his
good
humour
,
and
,
at
length
,
filled
his
bosom
with
rage
.
    
<EOS>
He
strove
to
suppress
his
indignation
,
and
called
every
consideration
of
vanity
and
revenge
to
his
aid
<EOS>
:
he
endeavoured
to
wean
his
eyes
from
the
fatal
object
that
disturbed
him
,
but
they
would
not
obey
his
direction
and
command
;
he
wished
himself
deprived
of
all
sensation
,
when
he
heard
her
laugh
,
and
saw
her
smile
upon
the
officer
;
and
,
in
the
course
of
country
-
dancing
,
when
he
was
obliged
to
join
hands
with
her
,
the
touch
thrill'd
thro
'
all
his
nerves
,
and
kindled
a
flame
within
him
which
he
could
not
contain
.
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
his
endeavours
to
conceal
the
situation
of
his
thoughts
,
were
so
violent
,
that
his
constitution
could
not
endure
the
shock
;
the
sweat
ran
down
his
forehead
in
a
stream
,
the
colour
vanished
from
his
cheeks
,
his
knees
began
to
totter
,
and
his
eyesight
to
fail
:
so
that
he
must
have
fallen
at
his
full
length
upon
the
floor
,
had
not
he
retired
very
abruptly
into
another
room
,
where
he
threw
himself
upon
a
couch
,
and
fainted
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
condition
he
was
found
by
his
friend
,
who
seeing
him
withdraw
with
such
symptoms
of
disorder
,
followed
him
thither
;
and
when
he
recovered
the
use
of
his
faculties
,
pressed
him
to
make
use
of
a
bed
in
that
house
,
rather
than
expose
himself
to
the
night
air
,
by
going
home
to
his
own
lodgings
:
but
not
being
able
to
prevail
upon
him
to
accept
the
offer
,
he
wrapped
him
up
in
a
cloak
,
and
conducting
him
to
the
inn
where
he
lodged
,
helped
him
to
undress
and
go
to
bed
,
where
he
was
immediately
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
the
ague
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
behaved
with
great
tenderness
,
and
would
have
actually
bore
him
company
all
night
,
notwithstanding
the
circumstances
of
his
own
situation
,
had
not
his
friend
insisted
upon
his
returning
to
the
company
,
and
making
his
apology
to
his
partner
for
his
sudden
departure
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
step
absolutely
necessary
towards
maintaining
the
quiet
of
the
assembly
,
which
he
found
in
great
consternation
,
occasioned
by
his
absence
;
for
some
of
the
ladies
seeing
the
bridegroom
follow
the
stranger
in
his
retreat
,
the
meaning
of
which
they
did
not
comprehend
,
began
to
be
afraid
of
a
quarrel
;
and
Emilia
,
upon
pretence
of
that
supposition
,
was
so
much
alarmed
,
that
she
could
not
stand
,
and
was
fain
to
have
recourse
to
a
smelling
bottle
.
    
<EOS>
The
bride
,
who
understood
the
whole
mystery
,
was
the
only
person
that
acted
with
deliberation
and
composure
;
she
imputed
Emilia
's
disorder
to
the
right
cause
,
which
was
no
other
than
concern
for
the
condition
of
her
lover
,
and
assured
the
ladies
there
was
nothing
extraordinary
in
Mr
Pickle
's
going
off
,
he
being
subject
to
fainting
fits
,
by
which
he
was
often
overtaken
without
any
previous
notice
.
<EOS>
The
arrival
of
Gauntlet
confirmed
the
truth
of
this
declaration
;
he
made
an
apology
to
the
company
,
in
the
name
of
his
friend
,
who
,
he
told
them
,
was
suddenly
taken
ill
;
and
they
returned
to
their
diversion
of
dancing
,
with
this
variation
:
Emilia
was
so
disordered
and
fatigued
,
that
she
begged
to
be
excused
from
continuing
the
exercise
;
and
Peregrine
's
partner
being
disengaged
,
was
paired
with
the
young
officer
for
whom
she
was
originally
designed
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
bride
withdrew
into
another
apartment
,
with
her
sister
,
and
expostulated
with
her
upon
her
cruelty
to
Mr
Pickle
,
assuring
her
,
from
Godfrey
's
information
,
that
he
had
undergone
a
severe
fit
on
her
account
,
which
,
in
all
likelihood
,
would
have
a
dangerous
effect
upon
his
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
Emily
was
inflexible
in
her
answers
to
the
kind
remonstrances
of
the
gentle
Sophy
,
her
heart
was
melting
with
the
impressions
of
pity
and
love
;
and
finding
herself
unable
to
perform
the
duty
of
her
function
,
in
putting
the
bride
to
bed
,
she
retired
to
her
own
chamber
,
and
,
in
secret
,
sympathized
with
the
distemper
of
her
lover
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
morning
,
as
early
as
decency
would
permit
him
to
leave
the
arms
of
his
dear
wife
,
captain
Gauntlet
made
a
visit
to
Peregrine
,
who
had
passed
a
very
tedious
and
uneasy
night
,
having
been
subject
to
short
intervals
of
delirium
,
during
which
Pipes
had
found
it
very
difficult
to
keep
him
fast
belayed
.
<EOS>
He
owned
indeed
to
Godfrey
,
that
his
imagination
had
been
haunted
by
the
ideas
of
Emilia
and
her
officer
,
which
tormented
him
to
an
unspeakable
degree
of
anguish
and
distraction
;
and
that
he
would
rather
suffer
death
than
a
repetition
of
such
excruciating
reflections
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
comforted
by
his
friend
,
who
assured
him
,
that
his
sister
's
inclinations
would
,
in
time
,
prevail
over
all
the
endeavours
of
resentment
and
pride
,
illustrating
this
asseveration
by
an
account
of
the
manner
in
which
she
was
affected
by
the
knowledge
of
his
disorder
,
and
advising
him
to
implore
the
mediation
of
Sophy
,
in
a
letter
which
she
should
communicate
to
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
an
opportunity
which
our
hero
thought
too
favourable
to
be
neglected
;
and
therefore
calling
for
paper
,
he
sat
up
in
his
bed
,
and
,
in
the
first
transports
of
his
emotion
,
wrote
the
following
petition
to
Godfrey
's
amiable
wife
.
    
<EOS>
Dear
madam
,
The
affliction
of
a
contrite
heart
can
never
appeal
to
your
benevolence
in
vain
;
and
therefore
I
presume
to
approach
you
,
in
this
season
of
delight
,
with
the
language
of
sorrow
,
requesting
that
you
will
espouse
the
cause
of
an
unhappy
lover
,
who
mourns
with
unutterable
anguish
over
his
ruined
hope
,
and
interceed
for
my
pardon
with
that
divine
creature
,
whom
,
in
the
intemperance
and
excess
of
passion
,
I
have
so
mortally
offended
.
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
is
my
guilt
inexpiable
?
<EOS>
Am
I
excluded
from
all
hope
of
remission
?
<EOS>
Am
I
devoted
to
misery
and
despair
?
<EOS>
I
have
offered
all
the
atonement
which
the
most
perfect
and
sincere
penitence
could
suggest
,
and
she
rejects
my
humility
and
repentance
.
<EOS>
If
her
resentment
would
pursue
me
to
the
grave
,
let
her
signify
her
pleasure
;
and
may
I
be
branded
with
the
name
of
villain
,
and
remembered
with
infamy
and
detestation
to
all
posterity
,
if
I
hesitate
one
moment
in
sacrificing
a
life
which
is
odious
to
Emilia
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
madam
,
while
I
thus
pour
forth
the
effusions
of
my
grief
and
distraction
,
I
look
around
the
apartment
in
which
I
lie
,
and
every
well
-
known
object
that
salutes
my
view
,
recals
to
my
remembrance
<EOS>
that
fond
,
that
happy
day
,
on
which
the
fair
,
the
good
,
the
tender
hearted
Sophy
became
my
advocate
,
though
I
was
a
stranger
to
her
acquaintance
,
and
effected
a
transporting
reconciliation
between
me
and
that
same
inchanting
beauty
,
that
is
now
so
implacably
incensed
.
    
<EOS>
If
she
is
not
satisfied
with
the
pangs
of
remorse
and
disappointment
,
the
transports
of
madness
I
have
undergone
;
let
her
prescribe
<EOS>
what
farther
penance
<EOS>
she
thinks
I
ought
to
endure
;
and
when
I
decline
her
sentence
,
let
me
be
the
object
of
her
eternal
disdain
.
      
<EOS>
I
commit
myself
,
dear
madam
!
<EOS>
dear
Sophy
!
<EOS>
dear
partner
of
my
friend
!
<EOS>
to
your
kind
interposition
.
<EOS>
I
know
you
will
manage
my
cause
,
as
a
concern
on
which
my
happiness
intirely
depends
;
and
I
hope
every
thing
from
your
compassion
and
benefience
,
while
I
fear
every
thing
from
her
rigour
and
barbarity
.
<EOS>
Yes
!
<EOS>
I
call
it
barbarity
,
a
savageness
of
delicacy
altogether
inconsistent
with
the
tenderness
of
human
nature
;
and
may
the
most
abject
contempt
be
my
portion
,
if
I
live
under
its
infliction
!
<EOS>
But
I
begin
to
rave
.
<EOS>
I
conjure
you
by
your
own
humanity
and
sweetness
of
disposition
,
I
conjure
you
by
your
love
for
the
man
whom
heaven
hath
decreed
your
protector
,
to
employ
your
influence
with
that
angel
of
wrath
,
in
behalf
of
 
Your
obliged
and
Obedient
servant
,
P
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
This
epistle
was
immediately
transmitted
by
Godfrey
to
his
wife
,
who
perused
it
with
marks
of
the
most
humane
sympathy
;
and
carrying
it
into
her
sister
's
chamber
,
"
<EOS>
Here
is
something
(
said
she
,
presenting
the
paper
)
which
I
must
recommend
to
your
serious
attention
.
"
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
who
immediately
guessed
the
meaning
of
this
address
,
absolutely
refused
to
look
upon
it
,
or
even
to
hear
it
read
,
till
her
brother
entering
the
apartment
,
reprimanded
her
sharply
for
her
obstinacy
and
pride
,
accused
her
of
folly
and
dissimulation
,
and
entered
so
warmly
into
the
interests
of
his
friend
,
that
she
thought
him
unkind
in
his
remonstrances
,
and
bursting
into
a
flood
of
tears
,
reproached
him
with
partiality
and
want
of
affection
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
who
entertained
the
most
perfect
love
and
veneration
for
his
sister
,
asked
pardon
for
having
given
offence
,
and
kissing
the
drops
from
her
fair
eyes
,
begg'd
<EOS>
she
would
,
for
his
sake
,
listen
to
the
declaration
of
his
friend
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
sollicited
,
she
could
not
refuse
to
hear
the
letter
,
which
when
he
had
repeated
,
she
lamented
her
own
fate
,
in
being
the
occasion
of
so
much
uneasiness
<EOS>
,
desired
her
brother
to
assure
Mr
Pickle
,
that
she
was
not
a
voluntary
enemy
to
his
peace
;
on
the
contrary
,
she
wished
him
all
happiness
,
tho
'
<EOS>
she
hoped
he
would
not
blame
her
for
consulting
her
own
,
in
avoiding
any
future
explanation
or
connexion
with
a
person
whose
correspondence
she
found
herself
under
a
necessity
to
renounce
.
    
<EOS>
In
vain
did
the
new
-
married
couple
exhaust
their
eloquence
in
attempting
to
prove
,
that
the
reparation
which
our
hero
had
offered
was
adequate
to
the
injury
she
had
sustained
;
that
in
reconciling
herself
to
a
penitent
lover
,
who
subscribed
to
her
own
terms
of
submission
,
her
honour
would
be
acquitted
by
the
most
scrupulous
and
severe
judges
of
decorum
;
and
that
her
inflexibility
would
be
justly
ascribed
to
the
pride
and
insensibility
of
her
heart
.
<EOS>
She
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
their
arguments
,
exhortations
and
intreaties
,
and
threatened
to
leave
the
house
immediately
,
if
they
would
not
promise
to
drop
that
subject
of
discourse
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
very
much
chagrined
at
the
bad
success
of
his
endeavours
,
returned
to
his
friend
,
and
made
as
favourable
a
report
of
the
affair
,
as
the
nature
of
his
conversation
with
Emilia
would
permit
;
but
as
he
could
not
avoid
mentioning
her
resolution
in
the
close
,
Peregrine
was
obliged
to
drink
again
the
bitter
draught
of
disappointment
,
which
put
his
passions
into
such
a
state
of
agitation
,
as
produced
a
short
extasy
of
despair
,
in
which
he
acted
a
thousand
extravagancies
.
<EOS>
This
paroxysm
,
however
,
soon
subsided
into
a
settled
reserve
of
gloomy
resentment
,
which
he
in
secret
indulged
,
detaching
himself
as
soon
as
possible
from
the
company
of
the
soldier
,
on
pretence
of
retiring
to
rest
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
lay
ruminating
upon
the
circumstances
of
his
present
situation
,
his
friend
Pipes
,
who
knew
the
cause
of
his
anxiety
,
and
firmly
believed
that
Emilia
loved
his
master
in
her
heart
,
howsoever
she
might
attempt
to
disguise
her
sentiments
;
I
say
,
Thomas
was
taken
with
a
conceit
which
he
thought
would
set
every
thing
to
rights
,
and
therefore
put
it
in
execution
,
without
farther
delay
.
<EOS>
Laying
aside
his
hat
,
he
ran
directly
to
the
house
of
Sophy
's
father
,
and
affecting
an
air
of
surprize
and
consternation
,
to
which
he
had
never
before
been
subject
,
thundered
at
the
door
with
such
an
alarming
knock
,
as
in
a
moment
brought
the
whole
family
into
the
hall
.
<EOS>
When
he
was
admitted
,
he
began
to
gape
,
stare
,
and
pant
at
the
same
time
,
and
made
no
reply
,
when
Godfrey
asked
what
was
the
matter
,
till
Mrs
Gauntlet
expressed
her
apprehensions
about
his
master
;
at
whose
name
being
mentioned
,
he
seemed
to
make
an
effort
to
speak
,
and
in
a
bellowing
tone
pronounced
"
Brought
himself
up
,
split
my
top
-
sails
!
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
pointed
to
his
own
neck
,
and
rose
upon
his
tiptoes
,
by
way
of
explaining
the
meaning
of
his
words
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
without
staying
to
ask
another
question
,
rushed
out
,
and
flew
towards
the
inn
,
with
the
utmost
horror
and
concern
;
while
Sophy
,
who
did
not
rightly
understand
the
language
of
the
messenger
,
addressing
herself
to
him
a
second
time
,
said
with
great
earnestness
,
"
I
hope
no
accident
has
happened
to
Mr
Pickle
!
"
<EOS>
"
No
accident
at
all
,
(
replied
Tom
)
<EOS>
he
has
only
hanged
himself
for
love
.
<EOS>
"
These
words
had
scarce
proceeded
from
his
mouth
,
when
Emilia
,
who
stood
listening
at
the
parlour
-
door
,
shrieked
aloud
,
and
dropped
down
senseless
upon
the
floor
;
while
her
sister
,
who
was
almost
equally
shocked
at
the
intelligence
,
had
recourse
to
the
assistance
of
her
maid
,
by
whom
she
was
supported
from
falling
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
hearing
Emily
's
voice
,
congratulated
himself
upon
the
success
of
his
stratagem
,
he
sprung
to
her
assistance
,
and
lifting
her
up
into
an
easy
chair
,
stood
by
her
,
until
he
saw
her
recover
from
her
swoon
,
and
heard
her
call
upon
his
master
's
name
,
with
all
the
frenzy
of
despairing
love
.
<EOS>
Then
he
bent
his
course
back
to
the
inn
,
overjoyed
at
the
opportunity
of
telling
Peregrine
what
a
confession
he
had
extorted
from
his
mistress
,
and
extremely
vain
of
this
proof
of
his
own
sagacity
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
Godfrey
arriving
at
the
house
,
in
which
he
supposed
this
fatal
catastrophe
had
happened
,
ran
up
stairs
to
Peregrine
's
chamber
,
without
staying
to
make
any
inquiry
below
;
and
finding
the
door
locked
,
burst
it
open
with
one
stroke
of
his
foot
.
<EOS>
But
,
what
was
his
amazement
,
when
,
upon
entrance
,
our
hero
starting
up
from
the
bed
,
saluted
him
with
a
boisterous
exclamation
of
"
Z####ds
!
who
's
there
?
"
    
<EOS>
He
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
,
which
also
rivetted
him
to
the
place
where
he
stood
,
scarce
crediting
the
testimony
of
his
own
senses
,
'
till
Peregrine
,
with
an
air
of
discontent
which
denoted
him
displeased
with
his
intrusion
,
dispelled
his
apprehension
by
a
second
address
,
saying
,
"
I
see
you
consider
me
as
a
friend
,
by
your
using
me
without
ceremony
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
,
thus
convinced
of
the
falsehood
of
the
information
he
had
received
,
began
to
imagine
,
that
Pickle
had
projected
the
plan
which
was
executed
by
his
servant
;
and
looking
upon
it
as
a
piece
of
unjustifiable
finesse
,
which
might
be
attended
with
very
melancholy
consequences
to
his
sister
or
wife
,
he
answered
in
a
supercilious
tone
,
that
he
must
blame
himself
for
the
interruption
of
his
repose
,
which
was
intirely
owing
to
the
sorry
jest
he
had
set
on
foot
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
was
the
child
of
passion
,
and
more
than
half
mad
with
impatience
before
this
visit
,
hearing
himself
treated
in
such
a
cavalier
manner
,
advanced
close
up
to
Godfrey
's
breast
,
and
assuming
a
stern
,
or
rather
frantic
countenance
,
"
Heark
ye
,
Sir
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
you
are
mistaken
<EOS>
if
you
think
I
jest
;
I
am
in
downright
earnest
<EOS>
I
assure
you
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
was
not
a
man
to
be
brow
beaten
,
seeing
himself
thus
bearded
by
a
person
of
whose
conduct
he
had
<EOS>
,
he
thought
,
reason
to
complain
,
put
on
his
military
look
of
defiance
,
and
erecting
his
chest
,
replied
with
an
exalted
voice
,
"
Mr
Pickle
,
whether
you
was
in
jest
or
earnest
,
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
that
the
scheme
was
childish
,
unseasonable
,
and
unkind
,
not
to
give
it
an
harsher
term
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Death
,
Sir
,
(
cried
our
adventurer
)
<EOS>
you
trifle
with
my
disquiet
:
if
there
is
any
meaning
in
your
insinuation
,
explain
yourself
,
and
then
I
shall
know
what
answer
it
will
befit
me
to
give
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
came
with
very
different
sentiments
,
(
resumed
the
soldier
)
but
since
you
urge
me
to
expostulation
,
and
behave
with
such
unprovoked
loftiness
of
displeasure
,
I
will
,
without
circumlocution
,
tax
you
with
having
committed
an
outrage
upon
the
peace
of
my
family
,
in
sending
your
fellow
to
alarm
us
with
such
an
abrupt
account
of
your
having
done
violence
upon
yourself
.
"
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
confounded
at
this
imputation
,
stood
silent
,
with
a
most
savage
aspect
of
surprize
,
eager
to
know
the
circumstance
to
which
his
accuser
alluded
,
and
incensed
to
find
it
without
the
sphere
of
his
comprehension
.
    
<EOS>
While
these
two
irritated
friends
stood
fronting
each
other
with
mutual
indignation
in
their
eyes
and
attitudes
,
they
were
joined
by
Pipes
,
who
without
taking
the
least
notice
of
the
situation
in
which
he
found
them
,
told
his
master
,
that
he
might
up
with
the
top
-
gallant
-
masts
of
his
heart
,
and
out
with
his
rejoicing
pendants
;
for
as
to
mistress
Emily
,
he
had
clapt
her
helm
a
-
weather
,
the
vessel
wore
,
and
now
she
was
upon
the
other
tack
,
standing
right
into
the
harbour
of
his
good
will
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
not
yet
a
connoisseur
in
the
terms
of
his
lacquey
,
commanded
him
,
upon
pain
of
his
displeasure
,
to
be
more
explicit
in
his
intelligence
;
and
by
dint
of
divers
questions
,
obtained
a
perfect
knowledge
of
the
scheme
which
he
had
put
in
execution
for
his
service
.
    
<EOS>
This
information
perplexed
him
not
a
little
;
he
would
have
chastised
his
servant
upon
the
spot
,
for
his
temerity
,
had
not
he
plainly
perceived
,
that
the
fellow
's
intention
was
to
promote
his
ease
and
satisfaction
;
and
on
the
other
hand
,
he
knew
not
how
to
acquit
himself
of
the
suspicion
which
he
saw
Godfrey
entertain
of
his
being
the
projector
of
the
plan
,
without
condescending
to
an
explanation
,
which
his
present
disposition
could
not
brook
.
<EOS>
After
some
pause
,
however
,
turning
to
Pipes
,
with
a
severe
frown
,
"
Rascal
!
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
this
is
the
second
time
I
have
suffered
in
the
opinion
of
that
lady
by
your
ignorance
and
presumption
;
if
ever
you
intermeddle
in
my
affairs
for
the
future
,
without
express
order
and
direction
,
by
all
that
's
sacred
!
<EOS>
I
will
put
you
to
death
without
mercy
.
<EOS>
Away
,
and
let
my
horse
be
saddled
this
instant
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pipes
having
withdrawn
,
in
order
to
perform
this
piece
of
duty
,
our
young
gentleman
,
addressing
himself
again
to
the
soldier
,
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
breast
,
said
with
a
solemnity
of
regard
,
"
Captain
Gauntlet
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
am
altogether
innocent
of
that
shallow
device
which
you
impute
to
my
invention
;
and
I
do
n't
think
you
do
justice
either
to
my
intellects
or
honour
,
in
supposing
me
capable
of
such
insolent
absurdity
.
<EOS>
As
for
your
sister
,
I
have
once
in
my
life
affronted
her
in
the
madness
and
impetuosity
of
desire
;
but
I
have
made
such
acknowledgements
,
and
offered
such
atonement
,
as
few
women
of
her
sphere
would
have
refused
;
and
before
God
!
<EOS>
I
am
determined
to
endure
every
torment
of
disappointment
and
despair
,
rather
than
prostrate
myself
again
to
the
cruelty
of
her
unjustifiable
pride
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
stalked
suddenly
down
stairs
,
and
took
horse
immediately
,
his
spirits
being
supported
by
resentment
,
which
prompted
him
to
vow
within
himself
,
that
he
would
seek
consolation
for
the
disdain
of
Emilia
,
in
the
possession
of
the
first
willing
wench
he
should
meet
upon
the
road
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
set
out
for
the
garison
with
these
sentiments
,
Gauntlet
,
in
a
suspence
between
anger
,
shame
and
concern
,
returned
to
the
house
of
his
father
-
in
-
law
,
where
he
found
his
sister
still
violently
agitated
from
the
news
of
Peregrine
's
death
,
the
mystery
of
which
he
forthwith
unravelled
,
recounting
at
the
same
time
the
particulars
of
the
conversation
which
had
happened
at
the
inn
,
and
describing
the
demeanour
of
Pickle
with
some
expressions
of
asperity
,
which
were
neither
agreeable
to
Emilia
,
nor
approved
by
the
gentle
Sophy
,
who
tenderly
chid
him
,
for
allowing
Peregrine
to
depart
in
terms
of
misunderstanding
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XCV
Peregrine
sets
out
for
the
garison
,
and
meets
with
a
nymph
of
the
road
,
whom
he
takes
into
keeping
,
and
metamorphoses
into
a
fine
lady
.
   
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
our
hero
jogged
along
in
a
profound
reverie
,
which
was
disturbed
by
a
beggar
-
woman
and
her
daughter
,
who
solicited
him
for
alms
,
as
he
passed
them
on
the
road
.
<EOS>
The
girl
was
about
the
age
of
sixteen
,
and
notwithstanding
the
wretched
equipage
in
which
she
appeared
,
exhibited
to
his
view
a
set
of
agreeable
features
,
enlivened
with
the
complexion
of
health
and
chearfulness
.
<EOS>
The
resolution
I
have
already
mentioned
was
still
warm
in
his
imagination
;
and
he
looked
upon
this
young
mendicant
as
a
very
proper
object
for
the
performance
of
his
vow
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
entered
into
a
conference
with
the
mother
,
and
for
a
small
sum
of
money
purchased
her
property
in
the
wench
,
who
did
not
require
much
courtship
and
intreaty
,
before
she
consented
to
accompany
him
to
any
place
that
he
should
appoint
for
her
habitation
.
    
<EOS>
This
contract
being
settled
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
ordered
Pipes
to
seat
his
acquisition
behind
him
upon
the
crupper
,
and
alighting
at
the
first
public
house
which
they
found
upon
the
road
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
Hatchway
,
desiring
him
to
receive
this
hedge
-
inamorata
,
and
direct
her
to
be
cleaned
and
cloathed
in
a
decent
manner
,
with
all
expedition
,
so
that
she
should
be
touchable
upon
his
arrival
,
which
(
on
that
account
)
he
would
defer
for
the
space
of
one
day
.
<EOS>
This
billet
,
together
with
the
girl
,
he
committed
to
the
charge
of
Pipes
,
after
having
laid
strong
injunctions
upon
him
to
abstain
from
all
attempts
upon
her
chastity
,
and
ordered
him
to
make
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
garison
,
while
he
himself
crossed
the
country
to
a
market
-
town
,
where
he
proposed
to
spend
the
night
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
thus
cautioned
,
proceeded
with
his
charge
,
and
being
naturally
taciturn
,
opened
not
his
lips
,
until
he
had
performed
the
best
half
of
his
journey
.
<EOS>
But
Thomas
,
notwithstanding
his
irony
appearance
,
was
in
reality
composed
of
flesh
and
blood
;
and
his
desire
being
titillated
by
the
contact
of
a
buxome
wench
,
whose
right
arm
embraced
his
middle
as
he
rode
,
his
thoughts
began
to
mutiny
against
his
master
,
and
he
found
it
almost
impossible
to
withstand
the
temptation
of
making
love
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
wrestled
with
these
rebellious
suggestions
with
all
the
reason
that
God
had
enabled
him
to
exert
;
and
that
being
totally
overcome
,
his
victorious
passion
suddenly
broke
out
in
this
address
.
    
<EOS>
"
'
Sblood
!
<EOS>
a
believe
<EOS>
master
thinks
I
have
no
more
stuff
in
my
body
than
a
dried
haddock
,
to
turn
me
adrift
in
the
dark
with
such
a
spanker
.
<EOS>
D'ye
think
he
do
n't
,
my
dear
?
<EOS>
"
To
this
question
his
fellow
traveller
replied
,
"
Swanker
!
<EOS>
Anan
!
"
<EOS>
And
the
lover
resumed
his
suit
,
saying
,
"
Oons
!
<EOS>
how
you
tickle
my
timbers
!
<EOS>
Something
shoots
from
your
arm
,
through
my
stowage
,
to
the
very
keel
-
stone
.
<EOS>
Han't
<EOS>
you
got
quick
-
silver
in
your
hand
?
"
<EOS>
"
Quicksilver

(
said
the
lady
)
<EOS>
D####n
<EOS>
the
silver
that
has
crossed
my
hand
this
month
.
<EOS>
D'ye
think
if
I
had
silver
,
I
should
n't
buy
me
a
smock
?
"
<EOS>
"
Addsooks
!
<EOS>
ye
baggage
,
(
cried
the
lover
)
<EOS>
you
should
n't
want
a
smock
nor
a
petticoat
<EOS>
neither
,
if
you
could
have
a
kindness
for
a
true
-
hearted
sailor
,
as
sound
and
strong
as
a
nine
inch
cable
,
that
would
keep
all
clear
above
-
board
,
and
every
thing
snug
under
the
hatches
.
"
<EOS>
"
Curse
your
gum
(
said
the
charmer
)
<EOS>
what
's
your
gay
balls
and
your
hatchets
to
me
?
"
<EOS>
"
Do
but
let
us
bring
to
a
little
,
(
answered
the
woer
,
whose
appetite
was
by
this
time
whetted
to
a
most
ravenous
degree
)
and
I
'll
teach
you
to
box
the
compass
,
my
dear
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
you
strapper
,
what
a
jolly
bitch
you
are
!
"
<EOS>
"
Bitch
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
this
modern
Dulcinea
,
incensed
at
the
opprobrious
term
)
such
a
bitch
as
your
mother
,
you
dog
.
<EOS>
D####n
ye
,
I
've
a
good
mind
to
box
your
jaws
instead
of
your
comepiss
.
<EOS>
I
'll
let
you
know
as
how
I
am
meat
for
your
master
,
you
saucy
blackguard
.
<EOS>
You
are
worse
than
a
dog
,
you
old
flinty
-
faced
,
flea
-
bitten
scrub
:
a
dog
wears
his
own
coat
,
but
you
wear
your
master
's
.
"
    
<EOS>
Such
a
torrent
of
disgraceful
epithets
from
a
person
who
had
no
cloaths
at
all
,
converted
the
gallant
's
love
into
choler
,
and
he
threatened
to
dismount
and
seize
her
to
a
tree
,
when
she
should
have
a
taste
of
his
cat
and
<EOS>
nine
tails
athwart
her
quarters
;
but
,
instead
of
being
intimidated
by
his
menaces
,
she
set
him
at
defiance
,
and
held
forth
with
such
a
flow
of
eloquence
,
as
would
have
intitled
her
to
a
considerable
share
of
reputation
,
even
among
the
nymphs
of
Billingsgate
;
for
this
young
lady
,
over
and
above
a
natural
genius
for
altercation
,
had
her
talents
cultivated
among
the
venerable
society
of
weeders
,
podders
,
and
hoppers
,
with
whom
she
had
associated
from
her
tender
years
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
,
that
she
soon
obtained
a
compleat
victory
over
Pipes
,
who
(
as
the
reader
may
have
observed
)
was
very
little
addicted
to
the
exercise
of
speech
:
indeed
he
was
utterly
disconcerted
by
her
volubility
of
tongue
;
and
being
altogether
unfurnished
with
answers
to
the
distinct
periods
of
her
discourse
,
very
wisely
chose
to
save
himself
the
expence
of
breath
and
argument
,
by
giving
her
a
full
swing
of
cable
,
so
that
she
might
bring
herself
up
;
while
he
rode
onwards
,
in
silent
composure
,
without
taking
any
farther
notice
of
his
fair
fellow
-
traveller
than
if
she
had
been
his
master
's
cloak
-
bag
.
    
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
the
dispatch
he
could
make
,
it
was
late
before
he
arrived
at
the
garison
,
where
he
delivered
the
letter
and
the
lady
to
the
lieutenant
,
who
no
sooner
understood
the
intention
of
his
friend
,
than
he
ordered
all
the
tubs
in
the
house
to
be
carried
into
the
hall
,
and
filled
with
water
;
and
Tom
having
provided
himself
with
swabs
and
brushes
,
divested
the
fair
stranger
of
her
variegated
drapery
,
which
was
immediately
committed
to
the
flames
,
and
performed
upon
her
soft
and
sleek
person
the
ceremony
of
scrubbing
,
as
it
is
practised
on
board
of
the
king
's
ships
of
war
.
<EOS>
Yet
the
nymph
herself
did
not
submit
to
this
purification
without
repining
:
<EOS>
she
curs'd
<EOS>
the
director
,
who
was
upon
the
spot
,
with
many
abusive
allusions
to
his
wooden
leg
:
<EOS>
and
as
for
Pipes
the
operator
,
she
employed
her
talons
so
effectually
upon
his
face
,
that
the
blood
ran
over
his
nose
in
sundry
streams
;
and
next
morning
,
when
those
rivulets
were
dry
,
his
countenance
resembled
the
rough
bark
of
a
plumb
-
tree
,
plastered
with
gum
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
did
his
duty
with
great
perseverance
,
cut
off
her
hair
close
to
the
scalp
,
handled
his
brushes
with
dexterity
,
applied
his
swabs
of
different
magnitude
and
texture
,
as
the
case
required
,
and
lastly
,
rinsed
her
whole
body
with
a
dozen
pails
of
cold
water
,
discharged
upon
her
head
.
    
<EOS>
These
ablutions
being
executed
,
he
dried
her
with
towels
,
accommodated
her
with
a
clean
shift
,
and
acting
the
part
of
a
valet
de
chambre
,
cloathed
her
from
head
to
foot
,
in
clean
and
decent
apparel
which
had
belonged
to
Mrs
Hatchway
;
by
which
means
her
appearance
was
altered
so
much
for
the
better
,
that
when
Peregrine
arrived
next
day
,
he
would
scarce
believe
his
own
eyes
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
for
that
reason
,
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
purchase
,
and
now
resolved
to
indulge
a
whim
which
seized
him
at
the
very
instant
of
his
arrival
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
(
as
I
believe
the
reader
will
readily
allow
)
made
considerable
progress
in
the
study
of
character
,
from
the
highest
rank
to
the
most
humble
station
of
life
,
and
found
it
diversified
in
the
same
manner
,
thro
'
every
degree
of
subordination
and
precedency
:
nay
<EOS>
,
he
moreover
observed
,
that
the
conversation
of
those
who
are
dignified
with
the
appellation
of
polite
company
,
is
neither
more
edifying
nor
entertaining
than
that
which
is
met
with
among
the
lower
classes
of
mankind
;
and
that
the
only
essential
difference
in
point
of
demeanor
,
is
the
form
of
an
education
,
which
the
meanest
capacity
can
acquire
,
without
much
study
or
application
.
<EOS>
Possessed
of
this
notion
,
he
determined
to
take
the
young
mendicant
under
his
own
tutorage
and
instruction
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
which
he
hoped
he
should
,
in
a
few
weeks
,
be
able
to
produce
her
in
company
,
as
an
accomplished
young
lady
of
uncommon
wit
,
and
an
excellent
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
This
extravagant
plan
he
forthwith
began
to
execute
with
great
eagerness
and
industry
;
and
his
endeavours
succeeded
even
beyond
his
expectation
.
<EOS>
The
obstacle
,
in
surmounting
of
which
he
found
the
greatest
difficulty
,
was
an
inveterate
habit
of
swearing
,
which
had
been
indulged
from
her
infancy
,
and
confirmed
by
the
example
of
those
among
whom
she
had
lived
.
<EOS>
However
,
she
had
the
rudiments
of
good
sense
from
nature
,
which
taught
her
to
listen
to
wholesome
advice
,
and
was
so
docile
as
to
comprehend
and
retain
the
lessons
which
her
governor
recommended
to
her
attention
;
insomuch
,
that
he
ventured
,
in
a
few
days
,
to
present
her
at
table
,
among
a
set
of
country
squires
,
to
whom
she
was
introduced
as
a
niece
of
the
lieutenant
.
<EOS>
In
that
capacity
she
sat
with
becoming
easiness
of
mien
(
for
she
was
as
void
of
the
mauvaise
honte
as
any
dutchess
in
the
land
)
bowed
very
graciously
to
the
compliments
of
the
gentlemen
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
she
said
little
or
nothing
,
because
she
was
previously
cautioned
on
that
score
,
she
more
than
once
gave
way
to
laughter
,
and
her
mirth
happened
to
be
pretty
well
timed
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
she
attracted
the
applause
and
admiration
of
the
guests
,
who
,
after
she
was
withdrawn
,
complimented
Mr
Hatchway
upon
the
beauty
,
breeding
and
good
humour
of
his
kinswoman
.
    
<EOS>
But
what
contributed
more
than
any
other
circumstance
to
her
speedy
improvement
,
was
some
small
insight
into
the
primer
,
which
she
had
acquired
at
a
day
-
school
,
during
the
life
of
her
father
,
who
was
a
day
-
labourer
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
Upon
this
foundation
did
Peregrine
build
a
most
elegant
superstructure
;
he
culled
out
choice
sentences
from
Shakespear
,
Otway
,
and
Pope
,
and
taught
her
to
repeat
them
with
emphasis
and
theatrical
cadence
:
he
then
instructed
her
in
the
names
and
epithets
of
the
most
celebrated
players
,
which
he
directed
her
to
pronounce
occasionally
,
with
an
air
of
careless
familiarity
;
and
perceiving
that
her
voice
was
naturally
clear
,
he
enriched
it
with
remnants
of
opera
tunes
,
to
be
hummed
during
a
pause
in
conversation
,
which
is
generally
supplied
with
the
circulation
of
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
<EOS>
By
means
of
this
cultivation
,
she
became
a
wonderful
proficient
in
the
polite
graces
of
the
age
;
she
,
with
great
facility
,
comprehended
the
scheme
of
whist
,
tho
'
cribbidge
was
her
favourite
game
,
with
which
she
had
amused
herself
in
her
vacant
hours
,
from
her
first
entrance
into
the
profession
of
hopping
;
and
brag
soon
grew
familiar
to
her
practice
and
conception
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
prepared
,
she
was
exposed
to
the
company
of
her
own
sex
,
being
first
of
all
visited
by
the
parson
's
daughter
,
who
could
not
avoid
shewing
that
civility
to
Mr
Hatchway
's
niece
,
after
she
had
made
her
public
appearance
at
church
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Clover
,
who
had
a
great
share
of
penetration
,
could
not
help
entertaining
some
doubts
about
this
same
relation
,
whose
name
she
had
never
heard
the
uncle
mention
,
during
the
whole
term
of
her
residence
at
the
garison
;
but
as
the
young
lady
was
treated
in
that
character
,
she
would
not
refuse
her
acquaintance
,
and
after
having
seen
her
at
the
castle
,
actually
invited
Miss
Hatchway
to
her
house
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
she
made
a
progress
thro
'
almost
all
the
families
in
the
neighbourhood
;
and
,
by
dint
of
her
quotations
,
(
which
,
by
the
bye
,
were
not
always
judiciously
used
)
<EOS>
she
passed
for
a
sprightly
young
lady
,
of
uncommon
learning
and
taste
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
,
in
this
manner
,
initiated
her
in
the
beau
monde
of
the
country
,
conducted
her
to
London
,
where
she
was
provided
with
private
lodgings
and
a
female
attendant
;
and
put
her
immediately
under
the
tuition
of
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
had
orders
to
instruct
her
in
dancing
and
the
French
language
.
<EOS>
He
attended
her
to
plays
and
concerts
,
three
or
four
times
a
week
;
and
when
our
hero
thought
her
sufficiently
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
great
company
,
he
squired
her
in
person
to
a
public
assembly
,
and
danced
with
her
among
all
the
gay
ladies
of
fashion
:
not
but
that
there
was
still
an
evident
air
of
rusticity
and
aukwardness
in
her
demeanor
,
which
was
interpreted
into
an
agreeable
wildness
of
spirit
,
superior
to
the
forms
of
common
breeding
.
    
<EOS>
He
afterwards
found
means
to
make
her
acquainted
with
some
distinguished
patterns
of
her
own
sex
,
by
whom
she
was
admitted
into
their
most
elegant
parties
,
and
continued
to
make
good
her
pretensions
to
gentility
,
with
great
circumspection
,
till
one
evening
,
being
at
cards
with
a
certain
lady
,
whom
she
detected
in
the
very
fact
of
unfair
conveyance
,
she
taxed
her
roundly
with
the
fraud
,
and
brought
upon
herself
such
a
torrent
of
sarcastic
reproof
,
as
overbore
all
her
maxims
of
caution
,
and
burst
open
the
floodgates
of
her
own
natural
repartee
,
twanged
off
with
the
appellations
of
b
#
#
#
#
and
w
#
#
#
#
,
which
she
repeated
with
great
vehemence
,
in
an
attitude
of
manual
defiance
,
to
the
terror
of
her
antagonist
,
and
the
astonishment
of
all
present
:
<EOS>
nay
,
to
such
an
unguarded
pitch
was
she
provoked
,
that
starting
up
,
she
snapt
her
fingers
,
in
testimony
of
disdain
,
and
,
as
she
quitted
the
room
,
applied
her
hand
to
that
part
which
was
the
last
of
her
that
disappeared
,
inviting
the
company
to
kiss
it
,
by
one
of
its
coarsest
denominations
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
a
little
disconcerted
at
this
oversight
in
her
behaviour
,
which
,
by
the
daemon
of
intelligence
,
was
in
a
moment
<EOS>
conveyed
to
all
the
private
companies
in
town
;
so
that
she
was
absolutely
excluded
from
all
polite
communication
,
and
Peregrine
,
for
the
present
,
disgraced
among
the
modest
part
of
his
female
acquaintance
,
many
of
whom
not
only
forbad
him
their
houses
,
on
account
of
the
impudent
insult
he
had
committed
upon
their
honour
as
well
as
understanding
,
in
palming
a
common
trull
upon
them
,
as
a
young
lady
of
birth
and
education
,
but
also
aspersed
his
family
,
by
affirming
that
she
was
actually
his
own
counsin
-
german
,
whom
he
had
precipitately
raised
from
the
most
abject
state
of
humility
and
contempt
.
    
<EOS>
In
revenge
for
this
calumny
,
our
young
gentleman
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
her
promotion
,
together
with
the
motives
that
induced
him
to
bring
her
into
the
fashionable
world
;
and
repeated
among
his
companions
,
the
extravagant
encomiums
which
had
been
bestowed
upon
her
by
the
most
discerning
matrons
of
the
age
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
the
infanta
herself
being
rebuked
by
her
benefactor
,
for
this
instance
of
misbehaviour
,
promised
faithfully
to
keep
a
stricter
guard
for
the
future
over
her
conduct
,
and
applied
herself
with
great
assiduity
to
the
studies
,
in
which
she
was
assisted
by
the
Swiss
,
who
gradually
lost
the
freedom
of
his
heart
,
while
she
was
profiting
by
his
instruction
.
<EOS>
In
other
words
,
she
made
a
conquest
of
her
preceptor
,
who
yielding
to
the
instigations
of
the
flesh
,
chose
a
proper
opportunity
to
declare
his
passion
,
which
was
powerfully
recommended
by
his
personal
qualifications
;
and
his
intentions
being
honourable
,
she
listened
to
his
proposals
of
espousing
her
in
private
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
agreement
,
they
made
an
elopement
together
;
and
being
buckled
at
the
fleet
,
consummated
their
nuptials
in
private
lodgings
,
by
the
Seven
Dials
,
from
which
the
husband
next
morning
sent
a
letter
to
our
hero
,
begging
forgiveness
for
the
clandestine
step
he
had
taken
,
which
he
solemnly
protested
was
not
owing
to
any
abatement
in
his
inviolable
regard
for
his
master
,
whom
he
should
always
honour
and
esteem
to
his
latest
breath
,
but
intirely
to
the
irresistible
charms
of
the
young
lady
,
to
whom
he
was
now
so
happy
as
to
be
joined
in
the
silken
bonds
of
marriage
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
tho
'
at
first
offended
at
his
valet
's
presumption
,
was
,
upon
second
thoughts
,
reconciled
to
the
event
by
which
he
was
delivered
from
an
incumbrance
;
for
by
this
time
he
had
performed
his
frolick
,
and
begun
to
be
tired
of
his
acquisition
.
    
<EOS>
He
reflected
on
the
former
fidelity
of
the
Swiss
,
which
had
been
manifested
in
a
long
course
of
service
and
attachment
;
and
thinking
it
would
be
cruelly
severe
to
abandon
him
to
poverty
and
distress
for
one
venial
trespass
,
he
resolved
to
pardon
what
he
had
done
,
and
enable
him
in
some
shape
to
provide
for
the
family
which
he
had
intailed
upon
himself
.
    
<EOS>
With
these
sentiments
,
he
sent
a
favourable
answer
to
the
delinquent
,
desiring
to
see
him
as
soon
as
his
passion
would
permit
him
to
leave
the
arms
of
his
spouse
,
for
an
hour
or
two
;
and
Hadgi
,
in
obedience
to
this
intimation
,
repaired
immediately
to
the
lodgings
of
his
master
,
before
whom
he
appeared
with
a
most
penitential
aspect
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
could
scarce
help
laughing
at
his
rueful
length
of
face
,
reprimanded
him
sharply
for
his
disrespect
and
ingratitude
,
in
taking
that
by
stealth
which
he
might
have
had
for
asking
;
and
the
culprit
assured
him
,
that
next
to
the
vengeance
of
God
,
his
displeasure
was
that
which
,
of
all
evils
,
he
dreaded
to
incur
;
but
that
love
had
distracted
his
brain
in
such
a
manner
,
as
to
banish
every
other
consideration
but
<EOS>
that
of
gratifying
his
desire
;
and
he
owned
,
that
he
should
not
have
been
able
to
preserve
his
fidelity
and
duty
to
his
own
father
,
had
they
interfered
with
the
interest
of
his
passion
.
<EOS>
He
then
appealed
to
his
master
's
own
heart
for
the
remission
of
his
guilt
,
alluding
to
certain
circumstances
of
our
hero
's
conduct
,
which
evinced
the
desperate
effects
of
love
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
he
made
such
an
apology
as
extorted
a
smile
from
his
offended
judge
,
who
not
only
forgave
his
transgression
,
but
also
promised
to
put
him
in
some
fair
way
of
earning
a
comfortable
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
The
Swiss
was
so
much
affected
with
this
instance
of
generosity
,
that
he
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
kissed
his
hand
,
praying
to
heaven
,
with
great
fervour
,
to
make
him
worthy
of
such
goodness
and
condescension
.
<EOS>
His
scheme
,
he
said
,
was
to
open
a
coffeehouse
and
tavern
in
some
creditable
part
of
the
town
,
in
hopes
of
being
favoured
with
the
custom
of
a
numerous
acquaintance
he
had
made
among
upper
servants
and
reputable
tradesmen
,
not
doubting
that
his
wife
would
be
an
ornament
to
his
bar
,
and
a
careful
manager
of
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
approved
of
the
plan
,
towards
the
execution
of
which
he
made
him
and
his
wife
a
present
of
five
hundred
pounds
,
together
with
a
promise
of
erecting
a
weekly
club
among
his
friends
,
for
the
reputation
and
advantage
of
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
Hadgi
was
so
transported
with
his
good
fortune
,
that
he
ran
to
Pipes
,
who
was
in
the
room
,
and
having
hugged
him
with
great
cordiality
,
and
made
his
obeisance
to
his
master
,
hied
him
home
to
his
yokefellow
,
to
communicate
his
happiness
,
cutting
capers
,
and
talking
to
himself
all
the
way
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XCVI
<EOS>
He
is
visited
by
Pallet
;
contracts
an
intimacy
with
a
New
-
market
nobleman
;
and
is
by
the
knowing
-
ones
taken
in
.
   
<EOS>
This
affair
being
settled
,
and
our
adventurer
,
for
the
present
,
free
of
all
female
connexions
,
he
returned
to
his
former
course
of
fast
living
,
among
the
bucks
of
the
town
,
and
performed
innumerable
exploits
among
whores
,
bullies
,
rooks
,
constables
,
and
justices
of
the
peace
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
midst
of
these
occupations
,
he
was
one
morning
visited
by
his
old
fellow
-
traveller
Pallet
,
whose
appearance
gave
him
equal
surprize
and
concern
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
the
weather
was
severe
,
he
was
cloathed
in
the
thin
summer
-
dress
which
he
had
wore
at
Paris
,
and
was
now
not
only
threadbare
,
but
in
some
parts
actually
patched
;
his
stockings
,
by
a
repetition
of
that
practice
known
among
oeconomists
by
the
term
of
coaxing
,
hung
like
pudding
-
bags
about
his
ankles
;
his
shirt
,
tho
'
new
-
wash'd
,
was
of
the
saffron
hue
,
and
in
divers
places
appeared
through
the
crannies
of
his
breeches
;
he
had
exchanged
his
own
hair
for
a
smoke
-
dry'd
tye
-
periwig
,
which
all
the
flour
in
his
drudging
-
box
had
not
been
able
to
whiten
;
his
eyes
were
sunk
,
his
jaws
lengthened
beyond
their
usual
extension
;
and
he
seemed
twenty
years
older
than
he
looked
when
he
and
our
hero
parted
at
Rotterdam
.
    
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
these
evidences
of
decay
,
he
accosted
him
with
a
meagre
affectation
of
content
and
good
humour
,
struggled
piteously
to
appear
gay
and
unconcerned
,
professed
his
joy
at
seeing
him
in
England
,
excused
himself
for
having
delayed
so
long
to
come
and
present
his
respects
;
alledging
,
that
since
his
return
he
had
been
a
meer
slave
to
the
satisfaction
of
some
persons
of
quality
and
taste
,
who
had
insisted
upon
his
finishing
some
pieces
with
the
utmost
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
received
him
with
that
compassion
and
complaisance
which
was
natural
to
his
disposition
,
inquired
about
the
healths
of
Mrs
Pallet
and
his
family
,
and
asked
if
his
friend
the
doctor
was
in
town
.
<EOS>
The
painter
seemed
to
have
resumed
his
resentment
against
that
gentleman
,
of
whom
he
spoke
in
contemptuous
terms
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
doctor
(
said
he
)
is
so
much
overshadowed
with
presumption
and
self
-
conceit
,
that
his
merit
has
no
relief
.
<EOS>
It
does
not
rise
.
<EOS>
There
is
no
keeping
in
the
picture
,
my
dear
Sir
.
<EOS>
All
the
same
as
if
I
were
to
represent
the
moon
under
a
cloud
;
there
would
be
nothing
but
a
deep
mass
of
shade
,
with
a
little
tiny
speck
of
light
in
the
middle
,
which
would
only
serve
to
make
,
as
it
were
,
the
darkness
visible
.
<EOS>
You
understand
me
.
<EOS>
Had
he
taken
my
advice
,
it
might
have
been
better
for
him
;
but
he
's
bigotted
to
his
own
opinion
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Mr
Pickle
,
upon
our
return
to
England
,
I
counselled
him
to
compose
a
little
,
smart
,
clever
ode
upon
my
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
As
Gad
shall
judge
me
,
I
thought
it
would
have
been
of
some
service
,
in
helping
him
out
of
obscurity
;
for
you
know
,
as
Sir
Richard
observes
,
Soon
will
that
die
,
which
adds
thy
fame
to
mine
.
<EOS>
Let
me
then
live
,
join'd
to
a
work
of
thine
.
    
<EOS>
By
the
bye
,
there
is
a
most
picturesque
contrast
in
these
lines
,
of
thy
and
me
,
living
and
dying
,
and
thine
and
mine
.
<EOS>
Ah
!
<EOS>
a
pize
upon
it
!
<EOS>
Dick
,
after
all
,
was
the
man
.
<EOS>
Ecod
!
<EOS>
he
rounded
it
off
.
<EOS>
But
,
to
return
to
this
unhappy
young
man
,
would
you
believe
it
,
he
tossed
up
his
nose
at
my
friendly
proposal
,
and
gabbled
something
in
Greek
,
which
is
not
worth
repeating
.
<EOS>
The
case
was
this
,
my
dear
Sir
,
he
was
out
of
humour
at
the
neglect
of
the
world
.
    
<EOS>
He
thought
the
poets
of
the
age
were
jealous
of
his
genius
,
and
strove
to
crush
it
accordingly
,
while
the
rest
of
mankind
wanted
taste
sufficient
to
discern
it
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
profess
myself
one
of
these
;
and
as
the
clown
in
Billy
Shakespear
says
of
the
courtier
's
oath
,
had
I
sworn
by
the
doctor
's
genius
,
that
the
pancakes
were
naught
<EOS>
,
they
might
have
been
for
all
that
very
good
,
yet
should
n't
I
have
been
forsworn
.
<EOS>
Let
that
be
as
it
will
,
he
retired
from
town
in
great
dudgeon
,
and
set
up
his
rest
near
a
hill
in
Derbyshire
,
with
two
tops
,
resembling
Parnassus
,
and
a
well
at
the
bottom
,
which
he
had
christened
Hyp
-
o
-
the
-
Green
.
<EOS>
Egad
!
<EOS>
if
he
stays
in
that
habitation
,
'
tis
my
opinion
<EOS>
he
'll
soon
grow
green
with
the
hip
indeed
.
<EOS>
He
'll
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
to
return
to
the
flesh
-
pots
of
Egypt
,
and
pay
his
court
to
the
slighted
queen
Cleopatra
.
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
well
remembered
,
by
this
light
.
<EOS>
You
shall
know
,
my
good
Sir
,
that
this
same
Egyptian
princess
has
been
courted
by
so
many
gallants
of
taste
,
that
as
I
hope
to
live
,
I
found
myself
in
some
sort
of
a
dilemma
,
because
in
parting
with
her
to
one
,
I
should
have
disobliged
all
his
rivals
.
<EOS>
Now
a
man
would
not
chuse
to
give
offence
to
his
friends
,
at
least
I
lay
it
down
as
a
maxim
,
to
avoid
the
smallest
appearance
of
ingratitude
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
I
may
be
in
the
wrong
.
<EOS>
But
every
man
has
his
way
.
<EOS>
For
this
reason
,
I
proposed
to
all
the
candidates
,
that
a
lottery
or
raffle
should
be
set
on
foot
,
by
which
every
individual
would
have
an
equal
chance
for
her
good
graces
,
and
the
prize
to
be
left
to
the
decision
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
The
scheme
was
mightily
relished
,
and
the
terms
being
such
a
trifle
as
half
a
guinea
,
the
whole
town
crouded
into
my
house
,
in
order
to
subscribe
.
    
<EOS>
But
there
I
was
their
humble
servant
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
you
must
have
a
little
patience
till
my
own
particular
friends
are
served
.
<EOS>
Among
that
number
,
I
do
myself
the
honour
to
consider
Mr
Pickle
.
<EOS>
Here
is
a
copy
of
the
proposals
;
and
if
the
list
should
be
adorned
with
his
name
,
I
hope
,
notwithstanding
his
merited
success
among
the
young
ladies
<EOS>
,
he
will
for
once
be
shunned
by
that
little
vixen
called
Miss
Fortune
;
he
,
he
,
he
!
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
bowed
with
a
thousand
apish
congs
,
and
presented
his
paper
to
Peregrine
,
who
seeing
the
number
of
subscribers
was
limited
to
one
hundred
,
said
he
thought
him
too
moderate
in
his
expectations
,
as
he
did
not
doubt
that
his
picture
would
be
a
cheap
purchase
at
five
hundred
,
instead
of
fifty
pounds
,
at
which
the
price
was
fixed
.
<EOS>
To
this
unexpected
remark
Pallet
answered
,
that
among
connoisseurs
he
would
not
pretend
to
appraise
his
picture
;
but
that
,
in
valuing
his
works
,
he
was
obliged
to
have
an
eye
to
the
Gothic
ignorance
of
the
age
in
which
he
lived
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
saw
at
once
into
the
nature
of
this
raffle
,
which
was
no
other
than
a
begging
shift
to
dispose
of
a
paultry
piece
,
that
he
could
not
otherwise
have
sold
for
twenty
shillings
.
<EOS>
However
,
far
from
shocking
the
poor
man
in
distress
,
by
dropping
the
least
hint
of
his
conjecture
,
he
desired
to
be
favoured
with
six
chances
,
if
the
circumstances
of
his
plan
would
indulge
him
so
far
;
and
the
painter
,
after
some
hesitation
,
condescended
to
comply
with
his
request
,
out
of
pure
friendship
and
veneration
;
tho
'
he
observed
,
that
in
so
doing
he
must
exclude
some
of
his
most
intimate
companions
.
    
<EOS>
Having
received
the
money
,
he
gave
Pickle
his
address
,
desiring
he
would
,
with
his
convenience
,
visit
the
princess
,
who
,
he
was
sure
,
would
display
her
most
engaging
attractions
,
in
order
to
captivate
his
fancy
;
and
took
his
leave
,
extremely
well
pleased
with
the
success
of
his
application
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
Peregrine
was
tempted
with
the
curiosity
of
seeing
this
portrait
,
which
he
imagined
must
contain
some
analogy
to
the
ridiculous
oddity
of
the
painter
,
he
would
not
expose
himself
to
the
disagreeable
alternative
of
applauding
the
performance
,
contrary
to
the
dictates
of
conscience
and
common
sense
,
or
of
condemning
it
,
to
the
unspeakable
mortification
of
the
miserable
author
;
and
therefore
never
dreamt
of
returning
the
painter
's
visit
:
nor
did
he
ever
hear
of
the
lottery
's
being
drawn
.
    
<EOS>
About
this
time
he
was
invited
to
spend
a
few
weeks
at
the
country
-
seat
of
a
certain
nobleman
,
with
whom
he
had
contracted
an
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
his
debauches
,
which
we
have
already
described
;
and
his
lordship
being
remarkable
for
his
skill
and
success
in
horse
-
racing
,
his
house
was
continually
filled
with
the
connoisseurs
and
admirers
of
that
sport
,
upon
which
the
whole
conversation
turned
,
insomuch
that
Peregrine
gradually
imbibed
some
knowledge
in
horse
-
flesh
,
and
the
diversions
of
the
course
;
for
the
whole
occupation
of
the
day
,
exclusive
of
eating
and
drinking
,
consisted
in
viewing
,
managing
and
exercising
his
lordship
's
stud
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
looked
upon
these
amusements
with
an
eye
of
taste
,
as
well
as
curiosity
;
he
contemplated
the
animal
as
a
beautiful
and
elegant
part
of
the
creation
,
and
relished
the
surprising
exertion
of
its
speed
with
a
refined
and
classical
delight
.
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
he
became
personally
acquainted
with
every
horse
in
the
stable
,
and
interested
himself
in
the
reputation
of
each
;
while
he
also
gratified
his
appetite
for
knowledge
,
in
observing
the
methods
of
preparing
their
bodies
,
and
training
them
to
the
race
.
<EOS>
His
landlord
saw
and
encouraged
his
eagerness
,
from
which
he
promised
himself
some
advantage
;
he
formed
several
private
matches
for
his
entertainment
,
and
flattered
his
discernment
,
by
permitting
him
to
be
successful
in
the
first
betts
he
made
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
he
artfully
decoyed
into
a
spirit
of
keenness
and
adventure
,
and
disposed
to
depend
upon
his
own
judgment
,
in
opposition
to
that
of
people
who
had
made
coursing
the
sole
study
of
their
lives
.
<EOS>
He
accompanied
my
lord
to
Newmarket
,
and
entering
at
once
into
the
genius
of
the
place
,
was
marked
as
fair
game
,
by
all
the
knowing
ones
there
assembled
,
many
of
whom
found
means
to
take
him
in
,
in
spite
of
all
the
cautions
and
admonitions
of
his
lordship
,
who
wanted
to
reserve
him
for
his
own
use
.
    
<EOS>
It
is
almost
impossible
for
any
man
,
let
him
be
never
so
fearful
or
phlegmatic
,
to
be
an
unconcerned
spectator
in
this
busy
scene
.
<EOS>
The
daemon
of
play
hovers
in
the
air
,
like
a
pestilential
vapour
,
tainting
the
minds
of
all
present
with
infallible
infection
,
which
communicates
from
one
person
to
another
,
like
the
circulation
of
a
general
pannic
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
seized
with
this
epidemic
distemper
to
a
violent
degree
;
and
after
having
lost
a
few
loose
hundreds
,
in
his
progress
through
the
various
rookeries
of
the
place
,
entered
into
partnership
with
his
noble
friend
in
a
grand
match
,
upon
the
issue
of
which
he
ventured
no
less
than
three
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
would
not
have
risqued
such
a
considerable
sum
,
had
not
his
own
confidence
been
reinforced
by
the
opinion
and
concurrence
of
his
lordship
,
who
hazarded
an
equal
bett
upon
the
same
event
.
<EOS>
These
two
associates
engaged
themselves
in
the
penalty
of
six
thousand
pounds
,
to
run
one
chaise
and
four
against
another
,
three
times
round
the
course
;
and
our
adventurer
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
his
antagonists
distanced
in
the
first
and
second
heat
;
but
all
of
a
sudden
,
one
of
the
horses
of
his
machine
was
knocked
up
,
by
which
accident
,
the
victory
was
ravished
almost
from
his
very
grasp
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
endure
the
damage
and
the
scorn
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
deeply
affected
with
this
misfortune
,
which
he
imputed
to
his
own
extravagance
and
temerity
,
but
discovered
no
external
signs
of
affliction
,
because
his
illustrious
partner
bore
his
loss
with
the
most
philosophic
resignation
,
consoling
himself
,
as
well
as
Pickle
,
with
the
hope
of
making
it
up
,
on
some
other
occasion
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
our
young
gentleman
could
not
help
admiring
and
even
envying
his
equanimity
,
not
knowing
that
his
lordship
had
managed
matters
so
as
to
be
a
gainer
by
the
misfortune
;
which
to
retrieve
,
Peregrine
purchased
several
horses
,
at
the
recommendation
of
his
friend
;
and
instead
of
returning
to
London
,
made
a
tour
with
him
to
all
the
celebrated
races
in
England
,
at
which
,
after
several
vicissitudes
of
fortune
,
he
made
shift
,
before
the
end
of
the
season
,
to
treble
his
loss
.
    
<EOS>
But
his
hopes
seemed
to
increase
with
his
ill
luck
;
and
in
the
beginning
of
winter
he
came
to
town
,
fully
persuaded
that
fortune
must
necessarily
change
,
and
that
next
season
he
should
reap
the
happy
fruits
of
his
experience
.
<EOS>
In
this
confidence
,
he
seemed
to
drown
all
ideas
of
prudence
and
oeconomy
;
his
former
expence
was
mere
parsimony
,
compared
with
that
which
he
now
incurred
:
he
subscribed
to
the
opera
,
and
half
a
dozen
concerts
at
different
parts
of
the
town
;
was
a
benefactor
to
several
hospitals
,
purchased
a
collection
of
valuable
pictures
,
took
an
house
,
and
furnished
it
in
a
most
magnificent
taste
,
laid
in
a
large
stock
of
French
wines
,
and
gave
extravagant
entertainments
to
his
quality
-
friends
,
who
in
return
loaded
him
with
compliment
,
and
insisted
upon
his
making
use
of
their
interest
and
good
-
will
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XCVII
<EOS>
He
is
taken
into
the
protection
of
a
great
man
;
sets
up
for
member
of
parliament
;
is
disappointed
in
his
expectation
,
and
finds
himself
egregiously
outwitted
.
   
<EOS>
Among
these
professed
patrons
,
the
greatest
part
of
whom
Peregrine
saw
thro
'
,
there
was
one
great
personage
,
who
seemed
to
support
with
dignity
the
sphere
in
which
fortune
had
placed
him
.
<EOS>
His
behaviour
to
Pickle
was
not
a
series
of
grinning
complaisance
,
in
a
flat
repetition
of
general
expressions
of
friendship
and
regard
.
    
<EOS>
He
demeaned
himself
with
a
seemingly
honest
reserve
,
in
point
of
profession
;
his
advances
to
Peregrine
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
deliberation
and
experiment
;
he
chid
the
young
gentleman
for
his
extravagance
with
the
authority
of
a
parent
,
and
the
sincerity
of
a
fast
friend
;
and
having
,
by
gradual
inquiries
,
made
himself
acquainted
with
the
state
of
his
private
affairs
,
condemned
his
conduct
with
an
air
of
candour
and
concern
.
<EOS>
He
represented
to
him
the
folly
and
dangerous
consequences
of
the
profligate
life
in
which
he
had
plunged
himself
,
counselled
him
with
great
warmth
to
sell
off
his
race
-
horses
,
which
would
otherwise
insensibly
eat
him
up
;
to
retrench
all
superfluous
expence
,
which
would
only
serve
to
expose
him
to
the
ridicule
and
ingratitude
of
those
who
were
benefited
by
it
;
to
lay
out
his
money
upon
secure
mortgages
,
at
good
interest
;
and
carry
into
execution
his
former
design
of
standing
candidate
for
a
borough
,
at
the
ensuing
election
for
a
new
parliament
;
in
which
case
,
this
nobleman
promised
to
assist
him
with
his
influence
and
advice
;
assuring
him
,
that
if
he
could
once
procure
a
seat
in
the
house
,
he
might
look
upon
his
fortune
as
already
made
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
perceived
the
wisdom
and
sanity
of
this
advice
,
for
which
he
made
his
acknowledgments
to
his
generous
monitor
,
protesting
that
he
would
adhere
to
it
in
every
particular
,
and
immediately
set
about
a
reformation
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
took
cognizance
of
his
most
minute
affairs
,
and
after
an
exact
scrutiny
,
gave
his
patron
to
understand
,
that
,
exclusive
of
his
furniture
,
his
fortune
was
reduced
to
fourteen
thousand
three
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
,
in
Bank
and
South
-
Sea
annuities
,
over
and
above
the
garison
and
its
appendages
,
which
he
reckoned
at
sixty
pounds
a
year
.
    
<EOS>
He
therefore
desired
,
that
as
his
lordship
had
been
so
kind
as
to
favour
him
with
his
friendship
and
advice
,
he
would
extend
his
generosity
still
farther
,
by
putting
him
in
a
way
of
making
the
most
advantage
of
his
money
.
<EOS>
My
lord
said
,
that
for
his
own
part
he
did
not
chuse
to
meddle
in
money
-
matters
;
that
he
would
find
abundance
of
people
ready
to
borrow
it
upon
land
-
security
;
but
that
he
ought
to
be
extremely
cautious
in
a
transaction
of
such
consequence
;
promising
at
the
same
time
,
to
employ
his
own
steward
,
in
seeking
out
a
mortgager
to
whom
it
might
be
safely
lent
.
    
<EOS>
This
agent
was
accordingly
set
at
work
,
and
for
a
few
days
made
a
fruitless
inquiry
;
so
that
the
young
gentleman
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
his
own
intelligence
,
by
which
he
got
notice
of
several
people
of
reputed
credit
,
who
offered
him
mortgages
for
the
whole
sum
;
but
when
he
made
a
report
of
the
particulars
to
his
noble
friend
,
his
lordship
started
such
doubts
and
objections
relating
to
each
,
that
he
was
deterred
from
entering
into
any
engagements
with
the
proposers
;
congratulating
himself
,
in
the
mean
time
,
on
his
good
fortune
,
in
being
favoured
with
the
advice
and
direction
of
such
a
sage
counsellor
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
began
to
be
impatient
,
after
having
unsuccessfully
consulted
all
the
money
-
brokers
and
conveyancers
about
town
,
and
resolved
to
try
the
expedient
of
a
public
advertisement
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
persuaded
by
my
lord
to
postpone
that
experiment
,
until
every
other
method
should
have
failed
,
because
it
would
attract
the
attention
of
all
the
pettifoggers
in
London
,
who
(
though
they
might
not
be
able
to
overreach
)
<EOS>
would
infallibly
harrass
and
teize
him
out
of
all
tranquillity
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
on
the
back
of
this
conversation
that
Peregrine
,
chancing
to
meet
the
steward
near
his
lord
's
house
,
stopped
him
in
the
street
,
to
give
him
an
account
of
his
bad
luck
;
at
which
the
other
expressed
some
concern
,
and
rubbing
his
chin
with
his
hand
,
in
a
musing
posture
,
told
Pickle
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
thought
just
come
into
his
head
,
pointing
out
one
way
of
doing
his
business
effectually
.
<EOS>
The
youth
,
upon
this
intimation
,
begg'd
he
would
accompany
him
to
the
next
coffee
-
house
,
in
which
having
chosen
a
private
situation
,
this
grave
manager
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
a
part
of
my
lord
's
estate
was
mortgaged
,
in
consequence
of
a
debt
contracted
by
his
grandfather
,
for
provision
to
the
younger
children
of
the
family
;
and
that
the
equity
of
redemption
would
be
foreclosed
in
a
few
months
,
unless
the
burthen
could
be
discharged
.
<EOS>
"
My
lord
(
said
he
)
has
always
lived
in
a
splendid
manner
,
and
notwithstanding
his
ample
fortune
,
together
with
the
profits
accruing
from
the
posts
he
enjoys
,
he
saves
so
little
money
,
that
,
upon
this
occasion
,
I
know
he
will
be
obliged
to
borrow
ten
thousand
pounds
,
to
make
up
the
sum
that
is
requisite
to
redeem
the
mortgage
.
<EOS>
Now
,
certain
I'am
,
that
when
his
design
comes
to
be
known
,
he
will
be
sollicited
on
all
hands
,
by
people
desirous
of
lending
money
upon
such
undoubted
security
;
and
'
tis
odds
<EOS>
but
he
has
already
promised
the
preference
to
some
particular
acquaintance
.
<EOS>
However
,
as
I
know
he
has
your
interest
very
much
at
heart
,
I
will
(
if
you
please
)
sound
his
lordship
upon
the
subject
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
give
you
notice
of
my
success
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
ravished
with
the
prospect
of
settling
this
affair
so
much
to
his
satisfaction
,
thanked
the
steward
for
his
friendly
hint
and
undertaking
,
which
he
assured
him
should
be
acknowledged
by
a
more
solid
proof
of
his
gratitude
,
provided
the
business
could
be
brought
to
bear
;
and
next
day
,
he
was
visited
by
this
kind
manager
,
with
the
happy
news
of
his
lordship
's
having
consented
to
borrow
ten
thousand
pounds
of
his
stock
,
upon
mortgage
,
at
the
interest
of
five
per
Cent
.
<EOS>
This
information
he
received
as
an
instance
of
the
singular
esteem
of
his
noble
patron
;
and
the
papers
being
immediately
drawn
and
executed
,
the
money
was
deposited
in
the
hands
of
the
mortgager
,
who
,
in
the
hearing
of
the
lender
,
laid
strong
injunctions
on
his
steward
to
pay
the
interest
punctually
at
quarter
-
day
.
    
<EOS>
The
best
part
of
our
hero
's
fortune
being
thus
happily
deposited
,
and
the
agent
gratified
with
a
present
of
fifty
pieces
,
he
began
to
put
his
retrenching
scheme
in
execution
;
all
his
servants
(
Pipes
excepted
)
were
discharged
,
his
chariot
and
running
-
horses
disposed
of
,
his
house
-
keeping
broke
up
,
and
his
furniture
sold
by
auction
:
nay
,
the
heat
of
his
disposition
was
as
remarkable
in
this
,
as
in
any
other
transaction
of
his
life
;
for
every
step
of
his
saving
project
was
taken
with
such
eagerness
,
and
even
precipitation
,
that
most
of
his
companions
thought
he
was
either
ruined
or
mad
.
<EOS>
But
he
answered
all
their
expostulations
with
a
string
of
prudent
apophthegms
,
such
as
,
"
The
shortest
follies
are
the
best
;
"
"
Better
to
retrench
upon
conviction
than
compulsion
;
"
and
divers
other
wise
maxims
,
seemingly
the
result
of
experience
and
philosophic
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
To
such
a
degree
of
enthusiasm
did
his
present
oeconomy
prevail
,
that
he
was
actually
seized
with
the
desire
of
amassing
;
and
as
he
every
day
received
proposals
,
from
those
brokers
whom
he
had
employed
,
about
the
disposal
of
his
cash
,
he
at
length
ventured
fifteen
hundred
pounds
upon
bottomry
,
being
tempted
by
the
excessive
premium
.
    
<EOS>
But
it
must
be
observed
,
for
the
honour
of
our
adventurer
,
that
this
reformation
did
not
at
all
interfere
with
the
good
qualities
of
his
heart
:
he
was
still
as
friendly
and
benevolent
as
ever
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
liberality
was
more
subjected
to
the
restraint
of
reason
;
and
he
might
have
justly
pleaded
,
in
vindication
of
his
generosity
,
that
he
retrenched
the
superfluities
in
his
own
way
of
living
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
power
of
assisting
his
fellow
-
creatures
in
distress
.
<EOS>
Numberless
were
the
objects
to
which
he
extended
his
charity
in
private
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
exerted
this
virtue
in
secret
,
not
only
on
account
of
avoiding
the
charge
of
ostentation
,
but
also
because
he
was
ashamed
of
being
detected
in
such
an
awkward
unfashionable
practice
,
by
the
censorious
observers
of
this
humane
generation
.
<EOS>
In
this
particular
,
he
seemed
to
confound
the
ideas
of
virtue
and
vice
;
for
he
did
good
as
other
people
do
evil
,
that
is
,
by
stealth
;
and
was
so
capricious
in
point
of
behaviour
,
that
frequently
,
in
public
,
he
wagged
his
tongue
in
satirical
animadversions
upon
that
poverty
,
which
his
hand
had
,
in
private
,
relieved
.
<EOS>
Yet
,
far
from
shunning
the
acquaintance
,
or
discouraging
the
solicitation
of
those
who
,
he
thought
,
wanted
his
assistance
,
he
was
always
accessible
,
open
,
and
complacent
to
them
,
even
when
the
haughtiness
of
his
temper
kept
his
superiors
at
a
distance
;
and
often
saved
a
modest
man
the
anguish
and
confusion
of
declaring
himself
,
by
penetrating
into
his
necessity
,
and
anticipating
his
request
,
in
a
frank
offer
of
his
purse
and
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
Not
that
he
practised
this
beneficence
to
all
the
needy
of
his
acquaintance
,
without
distinction
;
there
is
always
a
set
of
idle
profligate
fellows
,
who
having
squandered
away
their
own
fortunes
,
and
conquered
all
sense
of
honour
and
shame
,
maintain
themselves
by
borrowing
from
those
who
have
not
yet
finished
the
same
career
,
and
want
resolution
to
resist
their
importunate
demands
.
<EOS>
To
these
he
was
always
inflexible
;
though
he
could
not
absolutely
detach
himself
from
their
company
,
because
,
by
dint
of
effrontery
,
and
such
of
their
original
connexions
as
they
have
been
able
to
retain
,
they
find
admission
to
all
places
of
fashionable
resort
.
    
<EOS>
Several
insuccessful
attacks
had
been
made
upon
his
pocket
,
by
beggars
of
this
class
,
one
of
the
most
artful
of
whom
,
having
one
day
joined
him
in
the
Mall
,
and
made
the
usual
observation
on
the
weather
,
damned
the
fogs
of
London
,
and
began
a
dissertation
on
the
difference
of
air
,
preferring
that
of
the
county
in
which
he
was
born
,
to
any
climate
under
the
sun
.
<EOS>
"
Was
you
ever
in
Gloucestershire
?
"
(
said
he
to
Peregrine
)
who
replying
in
the
negative
,
he
thus
went
on
:
"
I
have
got
a
house
there
,
where
I
should
be
glad
to
see
you
.
<EOS>
Let
us
go
down
together
,
during
the
Easter
-
holidays
;
I
can
promise
you
good
country
-
fare
and
wholesome
exercise
;
for
I
have
every
thing
within
myself
,
and
as
good
a
pack
of
fox
-
hounds
as
any
in
the
three
kingdoms
.
<EOS>
I
sha
n't
pretend
to
expatiate
upon
the
elegance
of
the
house
,
which
to
be
sure
is
an
old
building
;
and
these
,
you
know
,
are
generally
cold
,
and
not
very
convenient
.
<EOS>
But
,
curse
the
house
!
<EOS>
the
dirty
acres
about
it
are
the
thing
;
and
a
damn'd
fine
parcel
they
are
,
to
be
sure
.
    
<EOS>
If
my
old
grandmother
was
dead
 
<EOS>
she
ca
n't
live
another
season
,
for
she
's
turned
of
fourscore
,
and
quite
wore
out
:
<EOS>
nay
,
as
for
that
matter
,
I
believe
I
have
got
a
letter
in
my
pocket
,
giving
an
account
of
her
being
despaired
of
by
the
doctors
.
<EOS>
Let
me
see
 
<EOS>
No
,
<EOS>
d####n
it
,
I
left
it
at
home
,
in
the
pocket
of
another
coat
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
from
the
beginning
of
this
harangue
,
saw
its
tendency
,
seemed
to
yield
the
most
serious
attention
to
what
he
said
;
breaking
in
upon
it
,
every
now
and
then
,
with
the
interjections
,
Hum
!
<EOS>
Ha
!
<EOS>
The
deuce
!
<EOS>
and
several
civil
questions
,
from
which
the
other
conceived
happy
omens
of
success
;
till
perceiving
they
had
advanced
as
far
as
the
passage
into
St
James
's
,
the
mischievous
youth
interrupted
him
all
at
once
,
saying
,
"
I
see
you
are
for
the
end
of
the
walk
;
this
is
my
way
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
he
took
his
leave
of
the
saunterer
,
who
would
have
delayed
his
retreat
,
by
calling
to
him
aloud
,
that
he
had
not
yet
described
the
situation
of
his
castle
.
<EOS>
But
Peregrine
,
without
stopping
,
answered
in
the
same
tone
,
"
Another
time
will
do
as
well
;
"
and
in
a
moment
disappeared
,
leaving
the
projector
very
much
mortified
with
his
disappointment
;
for
his
intention
was
to
close
the
description
,
with
a
demand
of
twenty
pieces
,
to
be
repaid
out
of
the
first
remittance
he
should
receive
from
his
estate
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
have
been
well
for
our
hero
,
had
he
always
acted
with
the
same
circumspection
:
but
he
had
his
unguarded
moments
,
in
which
he
fell
a
prey
to
the
unsuspecting
integrity
of
his
own
heart
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
a
person
among
the
number
of
his
acquaintances
,
whose
conversation
he
particularly
relished
,
because
it
was
frank
,
agreeable
,
and
fraught
with
many
sensible
observations
upon
the
craft
and
treachery
of
mankind
.
<EOS>
This
gentleman
had
made
shift
to
discuss
a
very
genteel
fortune
,
though
it
was
spent
with
taste
and
reputation
,
and
now
was
reduced
to
his
shifts
for
the
maintenance
of
his
family
,
which
consisted
of
a
wife
and
child
.
<EOS>
Not
that
he
was
destitute
of
the
necessaries
of
life
,
being
comfortably
supplied
by
the
bounty
of
his
friends
:
but
this
was
a
provision
not
at
all
suited
to
his
inclination
;
and
he
had
endeavoured
,
by
divers
unsuccessful
schemes
,
to
retrieve
his
former
independency
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
happened
one
evening
to
be
sitting
alone
in
a
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
over
-
heard
a
conversation
between
this
schemer
and
another
gentleman
,
touching
an
affair
that
engaged
his
attention
.
<EOS>
The
stranger
had
been
left
trustee
for
fifteen
hundred
pounds
bequeathed
to
the
other
's
daughter
by
an
aunt
,
and
was
strongly
solicited
to
pay
the
money
to
the
child
's
father
,
who
assured
him
,
he
had
then
an
opportunity
to
lay
it
out
in
such
a
manner
,
as
would
greatly
conduce
to
the
advantage
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
The
trustee
reminded
him
of
the
nature
of
his
charge
,
which
made
him
accountable
for
the
money
,
until
the
child
should
have
attained
the
age
of
eighteen
;
but
at
the
same
time
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
if
he
could
procure
such
security
as
would
indemnify
him
from
the
consequences
,
he
would
forthwith
pay
the
legacy
into
his
hands
.
    
<EOS>
To
this
proposal
the
father
replied
,
that
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
he
would
risque
the
fortune
of
his
only
child
,
upon
any
idle
or
precarious
issue
;
and
therefore
he
thought
it
reasonable
,
that
he
should
have
the
use
of
it
in
the
mean
time
;
and
that
,
as
to
security
,
he
was
loth
to
trouble
any
of
his
friends
about
an
affair
which
might
be
compromised
without
their
interposition
;
observing
,
that
he
would
not
look
upon
his
condescension
as
a
favour
,
if
obtained
by
a
security
,
on
which
he
could
borrow
the
same
sum
from
any
usurer
in
town
.
    
<EOS>
After
much
importunity
on
one
side
,
and
evasion
on
the
other
,
the
money'd
gentleman
told
him
,
that
though
he
would
not
surrender
the
sum
deposited
in
his
hands
,
for
the
use
of
his
daughter
,
he
would
lend
him
what
he
should
have
occasion
for
,
in
the
mean
time
;
and
if
,
upon
her
being
of
age
,
he
should
be
able
to
obtain
her
concurrence
,
the
money
should
be
placed
to
her
account
;
provided
he
could
find
any
person
of
credit
,
who
would
join
with
him
in
a
bond
,
for
the
assurance
of
the
lender
.
<EOS>
This
proviso
was
an
obstruction
which
the
other
would
not
have
been
able
to
surmount
,
without
great
difficulty
,
had
not
his
cause
been
espoused
by
our
hero
,
who
thought
it
was
pity
<EOS>
a
man
of
honour
and
understanding
should
suffer
in
his
principal
concerns
,
on
such
a
paultry
consideration
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
presuming
on
his
acquaintance
,
interposed
in
the
conversation
as
a
friend
,
who
interested
himself
in
the
affair
;
and
being
fully
informed
of
the
particulars
,
offered
himself
as
a
security
for
the
lender
.
    
<EOS>
This
gentleman
being
a
stranger
to
Peregrine
,
was
next
day
made
acquainted
with
his
funds
;
and
,
without
farther
scruple
,
accommodated
his
friend
with
one
thousand
pounds
,
for
which
he
took
their
bond
,
payable
in
six
months
,
though
he
protested
that
the
money
should
never
be
demanded
,
until
the
infant
should
be
of
age
,
unless
some
accident
should
happen
which
he
could
not
then
foresee
.
<EOS>
Pickle
believed
this
declaration
sincere
,
because
he
could
have
no
interest
in
dissembling
:
but
what
he
chiefly
depended
upon
,
for
his
own
security
,
was
the
integrity
and
confidence
of
the
borrower
,
who
assured
him
,
that
happen
what
will
,
he
should
be
able
to
stand
between
him
and
all
danger
;
the
nature
of
his
plan
being
such
,
as
would
infallibly
treble
the
sum
in
a
very
few
months
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
little
time
after
this
transaction
,
writs
being
issued
out
for
electing
a
new
parliament
,
our
adventurer
,
by
the
advice
of
his
patron
,
went
into
the
country
,
in
order
to
canvass
for
a
borough
,
and
lined
his
pockets
with
a
competent
share
of
bank
-
notes
for
the
occasion
.
<EOS>
But
,
in
this
project
,
he
unfortunately
happened
to
interfere
with
the
interest
of
a
great
family
in
the
opposition
,
who
,
for
a
long
series
of
years
,
had
made
members
for
that
place
;
and
were
now
so
much
offended
at
the
intrusion
of
our
young
gentleman
,
that
they
threatened
to
spend
ten
thousand
pounds
in
frustrating
his
design
.
<EOS>
This
menace
was
no
other
than
an
incitement
to
Peregrine
,
who
confided
so
much
in
his
own
influence
and
address
,
that
he
verily
believed
he
should
be
able
to
baffle
his
grace
,
even
in
his
own
territories
,
and
by
that
victory
establish
his
reputation
and
interest
with
the
minister
,
who
,
through
the
recommendation
of
his
noble
friend
,
countenanced
his
cause
,
and
would
have
been
very
well
pleased
to
see
one
of
his
greatest
enemies
suffer
such
a
disgraceful
overthrow
,
which
would
have
,
moreover
,
in
a
great
measure
shaken
his
credit
with
his
faction
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
intoxicated
with
the
ideas
of
pride
and
ambition
,
put
all
his
talents
to
the
test
,
in
the
execution
of
this
project
.
<EOS>
He
spared
no
expence
in
treating
the
electors
;
but
finding
himself
rivalled
,
in
this
respect
,
by
his
competitor
,
who
was
powerfully
supported
,
he
had
recourse
to
those
qualifications
in
which
he
thought
himself
superior
.
<EOS>
He
made
balls
for
the
ladies
,
visited
the
matrons
of
the
corporation
,
adapted
himself
to
their
various
humours
with
surprising
facility
,
drank
with
those
who
loved
a
cherishing
cup
in
private
,
made
love
to
the
amorous
,
prayed
with
the
religious
,
gossiped
with
those
who
delighted
in
scandal
,
and
with
great
sagacity
contrived
agreeable
presents
to
them
all
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
most
effectual
method
of
engaging
such
electors
as
were
under
the
influence
of
their
wives
;
and
as
for
the
rest
,
he
assailed
them
in
their
own
way
,
setting
whole
hogsheads
of
beer
and
wine
abroach
,
for
the
benefit
of
all
comers
;
and
into
those
sordid
hearts
that
liquor
would
not
open
,
he
found
means
to
convey
himself
by
the
help
of
a
golden
key
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
exerted
himself
,
his
antagonist
was
not
idle
;
his
age
and
infirmities
would
not
permit
him
to
enter
personally
into
their
parties
;
but
his
steward
and
adherents
bestirred
themselves
with
great
industry
and
perseverance
;
and
the
market
for
votes
ran
so
high
,
that
Pickle
's
ready
money
was
exhausted
before
the
day
of
election
;
and
he
was
obliged
to
write
to
his
patron
an
account
of
the
dilemma
to
which
he
was
reduced
;
intreating
him
to
take
such
speedy
measures
,
as
would
enable
him
to
finish
the
business
which
he
had
so
happily
begun
.
    
<EOS>
This
nobleman
communicated
the
circumstances
of
the
case
to
the
minister
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
<EOS>
our
candidate
found
credit
with
the
receiver
-
general
of
the
county
,
who
lent
him
twelve
hundred
pounds
on
his
personal
note
,
payable
on
demand
.
<EOS>
By
means
of
this
new
supply
,
he
managed
matters
so
successfully
,
that
an
evident
majority
of
votes
was
secured
in
his
interest
;
and
nothing
could
have
obstructed
his
election
,
had
not
the
noble
peer
who
set
up
his
competitor
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
shame
and
mortification
of
being
foiled
in
his
own
borough
,
offered
to
compromise
the
affair
with
his
honour
,
by
giving
up
two
members
in
another
place
,
provided
the
opposition
should
cease
in
his
own
corporation
.
<EOS>
This
proposal
was
greedily
embraced
;
and
,
on
the
eve
of
election
,
Peregrine
received
an
intimation
from
his
patron
,
desiring
him
to
quit
his
pretensions
,
on
pain
of
his
and
the
minister
's
displeasure
;
and
promising
that
he
should
be
elected
for
another
place
.
    
<EOS>
No
other
disappointment
in
life
could
have
given
him
such
chagrin
as
he
felt
at
the
receit
of
this
tantalizing
order
,
by
which
the
cup
of
success
was
snatched
from
his
lip
,
and
all
the
vanity
of
his
ambitious
hope
humbled
in
the
dust
.
<EOS>
He
curs'd
<EOS>
the
whole
chain
of
his
court
connexions
,
inveighed
with
great
animosity
against
the
rascally
scheme
of
politicks
,
to
which
he
was
sacrificed
;
and
in
conclusion
swore
he
would
not
give
up
the
fruits
of
his
own
address
for
the
pleasure
of
any
minister
upon
earth
.
    
<EOS>
This
laudable
resolution
,
however
,
was
rendered
ineffectual
by
his
friend
the
receiver
-
general
,
who
was
bearer
of
the
message
,
and
(
after
having
,
in
vain
,
endeavoured
to
persuade
him
to
submission
)
<EOS>
fairly
arrested
him
upon
the
spot
for
the
money
he
had
advanced
;
this
expedient
being
performed
by
virtue
of
a
writ
which
he
had
been
advised
to
take
out
,
in
case
the
young
man
should
prove
refractory
.
    
<EOS>
The
reader
,
who
,
by
this
time
,
must
be
pretty
well
acquainted
with
the
disposition
of
our
adventurer
,
may
easily
conceive
how
he
relished
this
imprisonment
.
<EOS>
At
first
,
all
the
faculties
of
his
soul
were
swallowed
up
in
astonishment
and
indignation
;
and
some
minutes
elapsed
before
his
nerves
would
obey
the
impulse
of
his
rage
,
which
manifested
itself
in
such
an
application
to
the
temples
of
the
plaintiff
,
as
laid
him
sprawling
on
the
floor
.
<EOS>
This
assault
,
which
was
committed
in
a
tavern
whither
he
had
been
purposely
decoyed
,
attracted
the
regard
of
the
bailiff
and
his
followers
,
who
,
to
the
number
of
four
,
rushed
upon
him
at
once
,
in
order
to
overpower
him
;
but
his
wrath
inspired
him
with
such
additional
strength
and
agility
,
that
he
disengaged
himself
from
them
in
a
trice
,
and
seizing
a
poker
,
which
was
the
first
weapon
that
presented
itself
to
his
hand
,
exercised
it
upon
their
skulls
with
incredible
dexterity
and
execution
.
    
<EOS>
The
officer
himself
,
who
had
been
the
first
that
presumed
to
lay
violent
hands
upon
him
,
felt
the
first
effects
of
his
fury
,
in
a
blow
upon
the
jaws
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
lost
three
of
his
teeth
,
and
fell
athwart
the
body
of
the
receiver
,
with
which
he
form'd
<EOS>
the
figure
of
a
St
Andrew
's
cross
:
one
of
his
myrmidons
seeing
the
fate
of
his
chief
,
would
not
venture
to
attack
the
victor
in
front
,
but
wheeling
to
one
side
,
made
an
attempt
upon
him
in
flank
,
and
was
received
obliquely
by
our
hero
's
left
hand
and
foot
,
so
masterly
disposed
to
the
right
side
of
his
leg
,
and
the
left
side
of
his
neck
,
that
he
bolted
head
foremost
into
the
chimney
,
where
his
chin
was
encountered
by
the
grate
,
which
,
in
a
moment
,
seared
him
to
the
bone
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
the
detachment
did
not
think
proper
to
maintain
the
dispute
,
but
evacuating
the
room
with
great
expedition
,
locked
the
door
on
the
outside
,
and
bellowed
aloud
to
the
receiver
's
servants
,
beseeching
them
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
their
master
,
who
was
in
danger
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
this
gentleman
having
recollected
himself
,
demanded
a
parley
;
which
having
with
difficulty
obtained
of
our
incensed
candidate
,
in
consequence
of
the
most
submissive
application
,
he
complained
grievously
of
the
young
gentleman
's
intemperance
and
heat
of
disposition
,
and
very
calmly
represented
the
danger
of
his
rashness
and
indiscretion
.
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
that
nothing
could
be
more
outrageous
or
idle
,
than
the
resistance
he
had
made
against
the
laws
of
his
country
,
because
he
would
find
it
impracticable
to
withstand
the
whole
executive
power
of
the
county
,
which
he
could
easily
raise
to
apprehend
and
secure
him
;
that
over
and
above
the
disgrace
that
would
accrue
to
him
from
this
imprudent
conduct
,
he
would
knock
his
own
interest
on
the
head
,
by
disobliging
his
friends
in
the
administration
,
who
were
,
to
his
knowledge
,
at
present
very
well
disposed
to
do
him
service
;
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
what
he
had
done
was
by
the
express
order
of
his
superiors
,
and
not
out
of
any
desire
of
distressing
him
;
and
that
,
far
from
being
his
enemy
,
notwithstanding
the
shocking
insult
he
had
sustained
,
he
was
ready
to
withdraw
the
writ
,
provided
he
would
listen
to
any
reasonable
terms
of
accommodation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
not
more
prone
to
anger
than
open
to
conviction
,
being
appeased
by
his
condescension
,
moved
by
his
arguments
,
and
chid
by
his
own
reflection
for
what
he
had
done
in
the
precipitation
of
his
wrath
,
began
to
give
ear
to
his
remonstrances
;
and
the
bailiffs
being
ordered
to
withdraw
,
they
entered
into
a
conference
,
the
result
of
which
was
our
adventurer
's
immediate
departure
for
London
:
so
that
next
day
his
competitor
was
unanimously
chosen
,
because
no
body
appeared
to
oppose
his
election
.
    
<EOS>
The
discontented
Pickle
,
on
his
arrival
in
town
,
went
directly
to
the
house
of
his
patron
,
to
whom
,
in
the
anguish
of
his
disappointment
,
he
bitterly
complained
of
the
treatment
he
had
received
,
by
which
,
besides
the
disgrace
of
his
overthrow
,
he
was
no
less
than
two
thousand
pounds
out
of
pocket
,
exclusive
of
the
debt
for
which
he
stood
engaged
to
the
receiver
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
who
was
prepared
for
this
expostulation
,
on
his
knowledge
of
the
young
man
's
impetuous
temper
,
answered
all
the
articles
of
his
charge
with
great
deliberation
,
giving
him
to
understand
the
motives
that
induced
the
minister
to
quit
his
interest
in
that
borough
;
and
soothing
him
with
assurances
that
his
loss
would
be
amply
rewarded
by
his
honour
,
to
whom
he
was
next
day
introduced
by
this
nobleman
,
in
the
warmest
stile
of
recommendation
.
<EOS>
The
minister
,
who
was
a
pattern
of
complaisance
,
received
him
with
the
most
engaging
affability
;
thanked
him
very
kindly
for
his
endeavours
to
support
and
strengthen
the
interest
of
the
administration
;
and
faithfully
promised
to
lay
hold
on
the
first
opportunity
to
express
the
sense
he
had
of
his
zeal
and
attachment
;
desiring
to
see
him
often
at
his
levee
,
that
in
the
multiplicity
of
business
he
might
not
be
in
danger
of
forgetting
his
services
and
desert
.

Chapter
XCVIII
Peregrine
commences
minister
's
dependent
;
meets
by
accident
with
Mrs
Gauntlet
;
and
descends
gradually
,
in
the
condition
of
life
.
   
<EOS>
This
reception
,
favourable
as
it
was
<EOS>
,
did
not
please
Peregrine
,
who
had
too
much
discernment
to
be
cajoled
with
general
promises
,
at
a
time
when
he
thought
himself
intitled
to
the
most
particular
assurance
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
signified
his
disgust
to
his
introductor
,
giving
him
to
understand
,
that
he
had
laid
his
account
with
being
chosen
representative
of
one
of
those
boroughs
for
which
he
had
been
sacrificed
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
agreed
to
the
reasonableness
of
his
expectation
,
observing
,
however
,
that
he
could
not
suppose
the
minister
would
enter
upon
business
with
him
,
on
his
first
visit
;
and
that
it
would
be
time
enough
,
at
his
next
audience
,
to
communicate
his
demand
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
remonstrance
,
our
hero
continued
to
indulge
his
suspicion
and
chagrin
,
and
even
made
a
point
of
it
with
his
patron
,
that
his
lordship
should
next
day
make
application
in
his
behalf
,
lest
the
two
seats
should
be
filled
up
,
on
pretence
of
his
inclination
's
being
unknown
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
importuned
,
my
lord
went
to
his
principal
,
and
returned
with
an
answer
,
importing
that
his
honour
was
extremely
sorry
that
Mr
Pickle
had
not
signified
his
request
before
the
boroughs
in
question
were
promised
to
two
gentlemen
whom
he
could
not
now
disappoint
,
with
any
regard
to
his
own
credit
or
interest
;
but
as
several
persons
who
would
be
chosen
were
,
to
his
certain
knowledge
,
very
aged
and
infirm
,
he
did
not
doubt
that
there
would
be
plenty
of
vacant
seats
in
a
very
short
time
;
and
then
the
young
gentleman
might
depend
upon
his
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
so
much
irritated
at
this
intimation
,
that
in
the
first
transports
of
his
anger
he
forgot
the
respect
he
owed
to
his
friend
,
and
in
his
presence
inveighed
against
the
minister
,
as
a
person
devoid
of
gratitude
and
candour
,
protesting
,
that
if
ever
an
opportunity
should
offer
itself
,
he
would
spend
the
whole
remains
of
his
fortune
in
opposing
his
measures
.
<EOS>
The
nobleman
having
given
him
time
to
exhaust
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
rebuked
him
very
calmly
for
his
disrespectful
expressions
,
which
were
equally
injurious
and
indiscreet
;
assured
him
that
his
project
of
revenge
,
if
ever
put
in
execution
,
would
redound
to
his
own
prejudice
and
confusion
;
and
advised
him
to
cultivate
and
improve
,
with
patience
and
assiduity
,
<EOS>
the
footing
he
had
already
obtained
in
the
minister
's
good
graces
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
convinced
of
the
truth
,
tho
'
not
satisfied
with
the
occasion
of
his
admonitions
,
took
his
leave
in
a
fit
of
sullen
discontent
,
and
began
to
ruminate
upon
the
shattered
posture
of
his
affairs
.
    
<EOS>
All
that
now
remained
of
the
ample
fortune
he
had
inherited
,
was
the
sum
he
had
deposited
in
his
lordship
's
hands
,
together
with
fifteen
hundred
pounds
he
had
ventured
on
bottomry
,
and
the
garison
,
which
he
had
left
for
the
use
and
accommodation
of
the
lieutenant
;
and
on
the
per
contra
side
of
his
account
he
was
debtor
for
the
supply
he
had
received
from
the
receiver
-
general
,
and
the
money
for
which
he
was
bound
in
behalf
of
his
friend
;
so
that
he
found
himself
,
for
the
first
time
of
his
life
,
very
much
embarassed
in
his
circumstances
:
<EOS>
for
,
of
the
first
half
year
's
interest
of
his
ten
thousand
,
which
was
punctually
paid
,
he
had
but
fourscore
pounds
in
bank
,
without
any
prospect
of
a
farther
supply
,
till
the
other
term
,
which
was
at
the
distance
of
four
long
months
.
<EOS>
He
seriously
reflected
upon
the
uncertainty
of
human
affairs
;
the
ship
with
his
fifteen
hundred
pounds
might
be
lost
,
the
gentleman
for
whom
he
was
security
,
might
miscarry
in
this
,
as
well
as
in
his
former
projects
,
and
the
minister
might
one
day
,
through
policy
or
displeasure
,
expose
him
to
the
mercy
of
his
dependant
,
who
was
in
possession
of
his
notes
.
    
<EOS>
These
suggestions
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
ease
of
our
adventurer
's
mind
,
already
ruffled
by
his
disappointment
.
<EOS>
He
cursed
his
own
folly
and
extravagance
,
by
which
he
was
reduced
to
such
an
uncomfortable
situation
.
<EOS>
He
compared
his
own
conduct
with
that
of
some
young
gentlemen
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
,
while
he
was
squandering
away
the
best
part
of
his
inheritance
,
had
improved
their
fortunes
,
strengthened
their
interest
,
and
increased
their
reputation
.
<EOS>
He
was
abandoned
by
his
gayety
and
good
humour
,
his
countenance
gradually
contracted
itself
into
a
representation
of
severity
and
care
,
he
dropped
all
his
amusements
and
the
companions
of
his
pleasure
,
and
turned
his
whole
attention
to
the
minister
,
at
whose
levee
he
never
failed
to
appear
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
laboured
in
the
wheel
of
dependance
,
with
all
that
mortification
which
a
youth
of
his
pride
and
sensibility
may
be
supposed
to
feel
from
such
a
disagreeable
necessity
,
he
one
day
heard
himself
called
by
name
,
as
he
crossed
the
Park
;
and
turning
,
perceived
the
wife
of
captain
Gauntlet
,
with
another
lady
.
<EOS>
He
no
sooner
recognized
the
kind
Sophy
,
than
he
accosted
her
with
his
wonted
civility
of
friendship
;
but
his
former
sprightly
air
was
metamorphosed
into
such
an
austerity
,
or
rather
dejection
of
feature
,
that
she
could
scarce
believe
her
own
eyes
;
and
in
her
astonishment
"
Is
it
possible
(
said
she
)
that
the
gay
Mr
Pickle
should
be
so
much
altered
in
such
a
short
space
of
time
!
"
<EOS>
He
made
no
other
reply
to
this
exclamation
,
but
by
a
languid
smile
;
and
asked
how
long
she
had
been
in
town
;
observing
,
that
he
would
have
paid
his
compliments
to
her
at
her
own
lodgings
,
had
he
been
favoured
with
the
least
intimation
of
her
arrival
.
<EOS>
After
having
thanked
him
for
his
politeness
,
she
told
him
,
it
was
not
owing
to
any
abatement
of
her
friendship
and
esteem
for
him
,
that
she
had
omitted
to
give
him
that
notice
;
but
his
abrupt
departure
from
Windsor
,
and
the
manner
in
which
he
quitted
Mr
Gauntlet
,
had
given
her
just
grounds
to
believe
,
that
they
had
incurred
his
displeasure
;
<EOS>
which
suspicion
was
reinforced
by
his
long
silence
and
neglect
from
that
period
,
to
the
present
time
;
when
she
observed
,
it
was
still
farther
confirmed
,
by
his
forbearing
to
inquire
for
Emilia
and
her
brother
:
<EOS>
"
Judge
then
,
(
said
she
)
if
I
had
any
reason
to
believe
that
you
would
be
pleased
to
hear
that
I
was
in
town
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
will
not
detain
you
at
present
,
because
you
seem
to
be
engaged
about
some
particular
business
;
but
,
if
you
will
favour
me
with
your
company
at
breakfast
to
-
morrow
,
I
shall
be
much
pleased
,
and
honoured
to
boot
,
by
the
visit
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
gave
him
a
direction
to
her
lodgings
;
and
he
took
his
leave
,
with
a
faithful
promise
of
seeing
her
at
the
appointed
time
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
very
much
affected
with
this
advance
of
Sophy
,
which
he
considered
as
an
instance
of
her
uncommon
sweetness
of
temper
;
he
felt
strange
longings
of
returning
friendship
towards
Godfrey
;
and
the
remembrance
of
Emilia
melted
his
heart
,
already
softened
with
grief
and
mortification
.
<EOS>
Next
day
,
he
did
not
neglect
his
engagement
,
and
had
the
pleasure
of
enjoying
a
long
conversation
with
this
sensible
young
lady
,
who
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
her
husband
was
with
his
regiment
;
and
presented
to
him
a
fine
boy
,
the
first
fruits
of
their
love
,
whom
they
had
christened
by
the
name
of
Peregrine
,
in
memory
of
the
friendship
which
had
subsisted
between
Godfrey
and
our
youth
.
    
<EOS>
This
proof
of
their
regard
,
notwithstanding
the
interruption
in
their
correspondence
,
made
a
deep
impression
upon
the
mind
of
our
adventurer
,
who
having
made
the
warmest
acknowledgements
for
this
undeserved
mark
of
respect
,
took
the
child
in
his
arms
,
and
almost
devoured
him
with
kisses
,
protesting
before
God
,
that
he
should
always
consider
him
with
the
tenderness
of
a
parent
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
highest
compliment
he
could
pay
to
the
gentle
Sophy
,
who
again
kindly
chid
him
for
his
disdainful
and
precipitate
retreat
,
immediately
after
her
marriage
;
and
expressed
an
earnest
desire
of
seeing
him
and
the
captain
reconciled
.
    
<EOS>
He
assured
her
,
nothing
could
give
him
greater
satisfaction
than
such
an
event
,
to
which
he
would
contribute
all
that
lay
in
his
power
,
though
he
could
not
help
looking
upon
himself
as
injured
by
captain
Gauntlet
's
behaviour
,
which
denoted
a
suspicion
of
his
honour
,
as
well
as
contempt
for
his
understanding
.
<EOS>
The
lady
undertook
for
the
concession
of
her
husband
,
who
(
she
told
him
)
had
been
extremely
sorry
for
his
own
heat
,
after
Mr
Pickle
's
departure
,
and
would
have
followed
him
to
the
garison
,
in
order
to
solicit
his
forgiveness
,
had
not
he
been
restrained
by
certain
punctilio
's
,
occasioned
by
some
acrimonious
expressions
that
dropt
from
Peregrine
at
the
inn
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
cleared
up
this
misunderstanding
,
she
proceeded
to
give
an
account
of
Emilia
,
<EOS>
whose
behaviour
,
at
that
juncture
,
plainly
indicated
a
continuance
of
affection
for
her
first
lover
;
and
desired
,
that
he
would
give
her
full
powers
to
bring
that
matter
also
to
an
accommodation
:
"
<EOS>
For
I
am
not
more
certain
of
my
own
existence
(
said
she
)
than
that
you
are
still
in
possession
of
my
sister
's
heart
.
<EOS>
"
At
this
declaration
,
the
tear
started
in
his
eye
,
while
he
shook
his
head
,
and
declined
her
good
offices
,
wishing
that
the
young
lady
might
be
much
more
happy
than
ever
he
should
be
able
to
make
her
.
    
<EOS>
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
confounded
at
these
expressions
,
and
moved
by
the
despondent
manner
in
which
they
were
delivered
,
begg'd
to
know
if
any
new
obstacle
was
raised
,
by
some
late
change
in
his
sentiments
or
situation
:
and
he
,
in
order
to
avoid
a
painful
explanation
,
told
her
,
that
he
had
long
despaired
of
being
able
to
vanquish
Emilia
's
resentment
,
and
for
that
reason
quitted
the
pursuit
,
which
he
would
never
renew
,
howsoever
his
heart
might
suffer
by
that
resolution
;
though
he
took
heaven
to
witness
,
that
his
love
,
esteem
,
and
admiration
of
her
were
not
in
the
least
impaired
:
but
the
true
motive
of
his
laying
aside
this
design
,
was
the
consciousness
of
his
decayed
fortune
,
which
,
by
adding
to
the
sensibility
of
his
pride
,
increased
the
horror
of
another
repulse
.
<EOS>
She
expressed
her
concern
for
this
determination
,
both
on
his
own
account
,
and
in
behalf
of
Emilia
,
whose
happiness
(
in
her
opinion
)
depended
upon
his
constancy
and
affection
;
and
she
would
have
questioned
him
more
minutely
about
the
state
of
his
affairs
,
had
not
he
discouraged
the
inquiry
,
by
seeking
to
introduce
another
subject
of
conversation
.
    
<EOS>
After
mutual
protestations
of
friendship
and
regard
,
he
promised
to
visit
her
often
,
during
her
residence
in
town
;
and
took
his
leave
in
a
strange
perplexity
of
mind
,
occasioned
by
the
images
of
love
,
intruding
upon
the
remonstrances
of
carking
care
.
<EOS>
He
had
some
time
ago
forsaken
those
extravagant
companions
with
whom
he
had
rioted
in
the
heyday
of
his
fortune
,
and
began
to
consort
with
a
grave
and
more
sober
species
of
acquaintance
:
but
he
now
found
himself
disabled
from
cultivating
the
society
of
these
also
,
who
were
men
of
ample
estates
and
liberal
dispositions
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
their
parties
were
too
expensive
for
the
consumptive
state
of
his
finances
;
so
that
he
was
obliged
to
descend
another
degree
,
and
mingle
with
a
set
of
old
batchelors
and
younger
brothers
,
who
subsisted
on
slender
annuities
,
or
what
is
called
a
bare
competency
in
the
public
funds
.
    
<EOS>
This
association
was
composed
of
second
-
hand
politicians
and
minor
critics
,
who
in
the
forenoon
saunter
in
the
Mall
,
or
lounge
at
shews
of
pictures
,
appear
in
the
drawing
-
room
once
or
twice
a
week
,
dine
at
an
ordinary
,
decide
disputes
in
a
coffee
-
house
,
with
an
air
of
superior
intelligence
,
frequent
the
pit
of
the
playhouse
,
and
once
in
a
month
spend
an
evening
with
some
noted
actor
,
whose
remarkable
sayings
they
repeat
for
the
entertainment
of
their
ordinary
friends
.
    
<EOS>
After
all
,
he
found
something
comfortable
enough
in
the
company
of
these
gentlemen
,
who
never
interested
his
passions
to
any
violence
of
transport
,
nor
teazed
him
with
impertinent
curiosity
about
his
private
affairs
:
for
though
many
of
them
had
maintained
a
very
long
,
close
,
and
friendly
correspondence
with
each
other
,
they
never
dreamt
of
inquiring
into
particular
concerns
;
and
if
one
of
the
two
who
were
most
intimately
connected
,
had
been
asked
how
the
other
made
shift
to
live
,
he
would
have
answered
,
with
great
truth
,
"
Really
,
that
is
more
than
I
know
.
<EOS>
"
Notwithstanding
this
phlegmatic
indifference
,
which
is
of
the
true
English
production
,
they
were
all
inoffensive
,
good
-
natured
people
,
who
loved
a
joke
and
a
song
,
delighted
in
telling
a
merry
story
,
and
prided
themselves
in
the
art
of
catering
,
especially
in
the
articles
of
fresh
venison
and
wild
fowl
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
was
not
received
among
them
on
the
footing
of
a
common
member
,
who
makes
interest
for
his
admission
;
he
was
courted
as
a
person
of
superior
genius
and
importance
,
and
his
compliance
looked
upon
as
an
honour
to
their
society
.
<EOS>
This
their
idea
of
his
preheminence
was
supported
by
his
conversation
,
which
,
while
it
was
more
liberal
and
learned
than
that
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
,
was
tinctured
with
an
assuming
air
,
so
agreeably
diffused
,
that
instead
of
producing
aversion
,
it
commanded
respect
.
    
<EOS>
They
not
only
appealed
to
him
,
in
all
doubts
relating
to
foreign
parts
,
to
which
one
and
all
of
them
were
strangers
,
but
also
consulted
his
knowledge
in
history
and
divinity
,
which
were
frequently
the
topics
of
their
debates
;
and
in
poetry
of
all
kinds
,
he
decided
with
such
magisterial
authority
,
as
even
weighed
against
the
opinions
of
the
players
themselves
.
<EOS>
The
variety
of
characters
he
had
seen
and
observed
,
and
the
high
spheres
of
life
in
which
he
had
so
lately
moved
,
furnished
him
with
a
thousand
entertaining
anecdotes
;
and
when
he
became
a
little
familiarized
to
his
disappointments
,
so
that
his
natural
vivacity
began
to
revive
,
he
flashed
among
them
in
such
a
number
of
bright
sallies
,
as
struck
them
with
admiration
,
and
constituted
himself
a
classic
in
wit
:
<EOS>
insomuch
that
they
began
to
retail
his
remnants
,
and
even
invited
some
particular
friends
to
come
and
hear
him
hold
forth
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
players
,
who
had
for
many
years
strutted
about
the
taverns
in
the
neighbourhood
of
Covent
-
garden
,
as
the
Grand
Turk
of
wit
and
humour
,
began
to
find
his
admirers
melt
away
;
and
a
certain
petulant
physician
,
who
had
shone
at
almost
all
the
Port
-
clubs
in
that
end
of
the
town
,
was
actually
obliged
to
import
his
talents
into
the
city
,
where
he
has
now
happily
taken
root
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
success
to
be
wondered
at
,
if
we
consider
that
,
over
and
above
his
natural
genius
and
education
,
our
adventurer
still
had
the
opportunity
of
knowing
every
thing
which
happened
among
the
great
,
by
means
of
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
with
whom
he
still
maintained
his
former
intimacy
,
though
it
was
now
checquered
with
many
occasional
tists
,
owing
to
the
sarcastic
remonstrances
of
the
Misanthrope
,
who
disapproved
of
those
schemes
which
miscarried
with
Peregrine
,
and
now
took
unseasonable
methods
of
valuing
himself
upon
his
own
foresight
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
was
between
whiles
like
a
raven
croaking
presages
of
more
ill
luck
from
the
deceit
of
the
minister
,
the
dissimulation
of
his
patron
,
the
folly
of
the
projector
for
whom
he
was
bound
,
the
uncertainty
of
the
seas
,
and
the
villainy
of
those
with
whom
he
had
entrusted
his
cash
:
for
Crabtree
saw
and
considered
every
thing
through
a
perspective
of
spleen
,
that
always
reflected
the
worst
side
of
human
nature
.
    
<EOS>
For
these
reasons
,
our
young
gentleman
began
to
be
disgusted
,
at
certain
intervals
,
with
the
character
of
this
old
man
,
whom
he
now
thought
a
morose
cynic
,
not
so
much
incensed
against
the
follies
and
vices
of
mankind
,
as
delighted
with
the
distress
of
his
fellow
creatures
.
<EOS>
Thus
he
put
the
most
unfavourable
construction
on
the
principles
of
his
friend
,
because
he
found
himself
justly
fallen
under
the
lash
of
his
animadversion
.
<EOS>
This
self
-
accusation
very
often
dissolves
the
closest
friendship
:
<EOS>
a
man
,
conscious
of
his
own
indiscretion
,
is
implacably
offended
at
the
rectitude
of
his
companion
's
conduct
,
which
he
considers
as
an
insult
upon
his
failings
,
never
to
be
forgiven
,
even
though
he
has
not
tasted
the
bitterness
of
reproof
,
which
no
sinner
can
commodiously
digest
.
<EOS>
The
friendship
,
therefore
,
subsisting
between
Crabtree
and
Pickle
,
had
of
late
suffered
several
symptomatic
shocks
that
seemed
to
prognosticate
a
total
dissolution
;
a
great
deal
of
smart
dialogue
had
passed
in
their
private
conversations
,
and
the
senior
began
to
repent
of
having
placed
his
confidence
in
such
an
imprudent
,
headstrong
,
ungovernable
youth
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
in
such
paroxysms
of
displeasure
,
that
he
prophesied
misfortune
to
Peregrine
,
and
even
told
him
one
morning
,
that
he
had
dream'd
<EOS>
of
the
shipwreck
of
the
two
East
-
Indiamen
on
board
of
which
he
had
hazarded
his
money
.
<EOS>
But
this
was
no
other
than
a
false
vision
;
for
,
in
a
few
weeks
,
one
of
them
arrived
at
her
moorings
in
the
river
,
and
he
received
a
thousand
,
in
lieu
of
eight
hundred
pounds
which
he
had
lent
upon
bond
to
one
of
the
mates
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
he
was
informed
,
that
the
other
ship
,
in
which
he
was
concerned
,
had
,
in
all
probability
,
lost
her
passage
for
the
season
,
by
being
unable
to
weather
the
Cape
.
<EOS>
He
was
not
at
all
concerned
at
that
piece
of
news
,
knowing
,
that
the
longer
he
should
lie
out
of
his
money
,
he
would
have
the
more
interest
to
receive
;
and
finding
his
present
difficulties
removed
by
this
supply
,
his
heart
began
to
dilate
,
and
his
countenance
to
resume
its
former
alacrity
.
    
<EOS>
This
state
of
exultation
,
however
,
was
soon
interrupted
by
a
small
accident
,
which
he
could
not
foresee
:
<EOS>
he
was
visited
one
morning
by
the
person
who
had
lent
his
friend
a
thousand
pounds
on
his
security
,
and
given
to
understand
,
that
the
borrower
had
absconded
,
in
consequence
of
a
disappointment
,
by
which
he
had
lost
the
whole
sum
,
and
all
hopes
of
retrieving
it
;
so
that
our
hero
was
now
liable
for
the
debt
,
which
he
besought
him
to
discharge
according
to
the
bond
,
that
he
(
the
lender
)
might
not
suffer
by
his
humanity
.
<EOS>
It
may
be
easily
conceived
,
that
Peregrine
did
not
receive
this
intelligence
in
cold
blood
.
    
<EOS>
He
cursed
his
own
imprudence
in
contracting
such
engagements
with
an
adventurer
,
whom
he
did
not
sufficiently
know
,
exclaimed
against
the
treachery
of
the
projector
;
and
having
for
some
time
indulged
his
resentment
in
threats
and
imprecations
,
inquired
into
the
nature
of
the
scheme
which
had
miscarried
.
    
<EOS>
The
lender
,
who
had
informed
himself
of
the
whole
affair
,
gratified
his
curiosity
in
this
particular
,
by
telling
him
that
the
fugitive
had
been
cajoled
by
a
certain
knight
of
the
post
,
who
undertook
to
manage
the
thousand
pounds
in
such
a
manner
,
as
would
,
in
a
very
little
time
,
make
him
perfectly
independent
;
and
thus
he
delineated
the
plan
:
"
One
half
of
the
sum
(
said
he
)
shall
be
laid
out
in
jewels
,
which
I
will
pawn
to
certain
persons
of
credit
and
fortune
,
who
lend
money
upon
such
pledges
at
an
exorbitant
interest
.
<EOS>
The
other
shall
be
kept
for
relieving
them
,
so
that
they
may
be
again
deposited
with
a
second
set
of
those
honourable
usurers
;
and
when
they
shall
have
been
circulated
in
this
manner
through
a
variety
of
hands
,
we
will
extort
money
from
each
of
the
pawn
-
brokers
,
by
threatening
them
with
a
public
prosecution
,
for
exacting
illegal
interest
;
and
I
know
that
they
will
bleed
freely
,
rather
than
be
exposed
to
the
infamy
attending
such
an
accusation
.
<EOS>
"
The
scheme
was
feasible
,
and
though
not
very
honourable
,
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
needy
borrower
,
that
he
assented
to
the
proposal
;
and
,
by
our
hero
's
credit
,
the
money
was
raised
.
<EOS>
The
jewels
were
accordingly
purchased
,
pawned
,
relieved
,
and
re
-
pledged
by
the
agent
,
who
undertook
to
manage
the
whole
affair
;
and
so
judiciously
was
the
project
executed
,
that
he
could
have
easily
proved
each
lender
guilty
of
the
charge
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
far
successfully
transacted
the
business
,
this
faithful
agent
visited
them
severally
on
his
own
account
,
to
give
them
intimation
,
that
his
employer
intended
to
sue
them
on
the
statute
of
usury
;
upon
which
,
every
one
,
for
himself
,
bribed
the
informer
to
withdraw
his
evidence
,
by
which
alone
he
could
be
convicted
;
and
having
received
these
gratifications
,
he
had
thought
proper
to
retreat
into
France
,
with
the
whole
booty
,
including
the
original
thousand
that
put
them
in
motion
.
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
decampment
,
the
borrower
had
withdrawn
himself
;
so
that
the
lender
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
his
security
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
very
mortifying
account
to
our
young
gentleman
,
who
in
vain
reminded
the
narrator
of
his
promise
,
importing
,
that
he
would
not
demand
the
money
,
until
he
should
be
called
to
an
account
by
his
ward
;
and
observed
,
that
long
before
that
period
,
the
fugitive
might
appear
and
discharge
the
debt
.
<EOS>
But
the
other
was
deaf
to
these
remonstrances
;
alledging
,
that
his
promise
was
provisional
,
on
the
supposition
that
the
borrower
would
deal
candidly
and
fairly
;
that
he
had
forfeited
all
title
to
his
friendship
and
trust
,
by
the
scandalous
scheme
in
which
he
had
embarked
;
and
that
his
treacherous
flight
from
his
security
was
no
proof
of
his
honesty
and
intended
return
;
but
on
the
contrary
,
a
warning
,
by
which
he
(
the
lender
)
was
taught
to
take
care
of
himself
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
insisted
upon
his
being
indemnified
immediately
,
on
pain
of
letting
the
law
take
its
course
;
and
Peregrine
was
actually
obliged
to
part
with
the
whole
sum
he
had
so
lately
received
.
<EOS>
But
this
payment
was
not
made
without
extreme
reluctance
,
indignation
,
and
denunciation
of
eternal
war
against
the
absconder
,
and
the
rigid
creditor
,
betwixt
whom
he
suspected
some
collusion
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
XCIX
Cadwallader
acts
the
part
of
a
comforter
to
his
friend
;
and
is
in
his
turn
consoled
by
Peregrine
,
who
begins
to
find
himself
a
most
egregious
dupe
.
   
<EOS>
This
new
misfortune
,
which
he
justly
charged
to
the
account
of
his
own
folly
,
recalled
his
chagrin
;
and
though
he
endeavoured
with
all
his
might
to
conceal
the
affair
from
the
knowledge
of
Cadwallader
,
that
prying
observer
perceived
his
countenance
overcast
;
and
the
projector
's
sudden
disappearance
alarming
his
suspicion
,
he
managed
his
inquiries
with
so
much
art
,
that
in
a
few
days
he
made
himself
acquainted
with
every
particular
of
the
transaction
,
and
resolved
to
gratify
his
spleen
at
the
expence
of
the
impatient
dupe
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
took
an
opportunity
to
accost
him
with
a
very
serious
air
,
saying
,
a
friend
of
his
had
immediate
occasion
for
a
thousand
pounds
,
and
as
Peregrine
had
the
exact
sum
lying
by
him
,
he
would
take
it
as
a
great
favour
,
if
he
would
part
with
it
for
a
few
months
on
undoubted
security
.
<EOS>
Had
Pickle
known
the
true
motive
of
this
demand
,
he
would
,
in
all
likelihood
,
have
made
a
very
disagreeable
answer
;
but
Crabtree
had
wrapt
himself
up
so
securely
in
the
dissimulation
of
his
features
,
that
the
youth
could
not
possibly
penetrate
into
his
intention
;
and
in
the
most
galling
suspence
replied
,
that
the
money
was
otherwise
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
The
Misanthrope
,
not
contented
with
this
irritation
,
assumed
the
prerogative
of
a
friend
,
and
questioned
him
so
minutely
about
the
disposal
of
the
cash
,
that
after
numberless
evasions
,
which
cost
him
a
world
of
torture
to
invent
,
he
could
contain
his
vexation
no
longer
,
but
exclaimed
in
a
rage
,
"
Damn
your
impertinence
!
'
<EOS>
tis
gone
to
the
devil
,
and
that
's
enough
!
"
<EOS>
"
Thereafter
as
it
may
be
(
said
this
tormentor
,
with
a
most
provoking
indifference
of
aspect
)
I
should
be
glad
to
know
upon
what
footing
;
for
I
suppose
you
have
some
expectation
of
advantage
from
that
quarter
.
"
<EOS>
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
Sir
(
cried
the
impatient
youth
)
if
I
had
any
expectation
from
hell
,
I
would
make
interest
with
you
,
for
I
believe
from
my
soul
,
you
are
one
of
its
most
favoured
ministers
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
With
these
words
,
he
flung
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
Cadwallader
very
well
satisfied
with
the
chastisement
he
had
bestowed
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
cooled
himself
with
a
solitary
walk
in
the
park
,
during
which
the
violence
of
his
choler
gradually
evaporated
,
and
his
reflection
was
called
to
a
serious
deliberation
upon
the
posture
of
his
affairs
;
he
resolved
to
redouble
his
diligence
and
importunity
with
his
patron
and
the
minister
,
in
order
to
obtain
some
fine
-
cure
,
which
would
indemnify
him
for
the
damage
he
had
sustained
on
their
account
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
went
to
his
lordship
,
and
signified
his
demand
,
after
having
told
him
,
that
he
had
suffered
several
fresh
losses
,
which
rendered
an
immediate
provision
of
that
sort
necessary
to
his
credit
and
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
His
noble
friend
commended
him
for
the
regard
he
manifested
for
his
own
interest
,
which
he
considered
as
a
proof
of
his
being
at
last
detached
from
the
careless
inadvertency
of
youth
;
he
approved
of
his
demand
,
which
,
he
assured
him
,
should
be
faithfully
transmitted
to
the
minister
,
and
backed
with
all
his
influence
;
and
encouraged
his
hope
,
by
observing
,
that
some
profitable
places
were
at
that
time
vacant
,
and
,
so
far
as
he
knew
,
unengaged
.
    
<EOS>
This
conversation
helped
to
restore
the
tranquillity
of
Pickle
's
breast
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
still
harboured
resentment
against
Cadwallader
,
on
account
of
the
last
insult
;
and
on
the
instant
he
formed
a
plan
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
He
knew
the
misanthrope
's
remittances
from
his
estate
in
the
country
,
had
been
of
late
very
scanty
,
in
consequence
of
repairs
and
bankruptcies
among
his
tenants
:
so
that
,
in
spite
of
all
his
frugality
,
he
had
been
but
barely
able
to
maintain
his
credit
,
and
even
that
was
engaged
on
the
strength
of
his
running
rent
.
<EOS>
Being
therefore
intimately
acquainted
with
the
particulars
of
his
fortune
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
Crabtree
,
subscribed
with
the
name
of
his
principal
farmer
's
wife
,
importing
,
that
her
husband
being
lately
dead
,
and
the
greatest
part
of
her
cattle
destroyed
by
the
infectious
distemper
<EOS>
,
she
found
herself
utterly
incapable
of
paying
the
rent
which
was
due
,
or
even
of
keeping
the
farm
,
unless
he
would
,
out
of
his
great
goodness
,
be
pleased
to
give
her
some
assistance
,
and
allow
her
to
sit
free
for
a
twelvemonth
to
come
.
<EOS>
This
intimation
he
found
means
to
convey
by
post
from
a
market
-
town
adjoining
to
the
farm
,
directed
in
the
usual
stile
to
the
cynic
,
who
seeing
it
stamped
with
the
known
marks
,
could
not
possibly
suspect
any
imposition
.
    
<EOS>
Hackneyed
as
he
was
in
the
ways
of
life
,
and
steeled
with
his
boasted
stoicism
<EOS>
,
this
epistle
threw
him
into
such
an
agony
of
vexation
,
that
a
double
proportion
of
sowering
was
visible
in
his
aspect
,
when
he
was
visited
by
the
author
,
who
having
observed
and
followed
the
postman
at
a
proper
distance
,
introduced
a
conversation
upon
his
own
disappointments
,
in
which
,
among
other
circumstances
of
his
own
ill
-
luck
,
he
told
him
,
that
his
patron
's
steward
had
desired
to
be
excused
from
paying
the
last
quarter
of
his
interest
precisely
at
the
appointed
term
;
for
which
reason
,
he
should
be
utterly
void
of
cash
;
and
therefore
requested
,
that
Crabtree
would
accommodate
him
with
an
hundred
pieces
out
of
his
next
remittance
from
the
country
.
    
<EOS>
This
demand
galled
and
perplexed
the
old
man
to
such
a
degree
,
that
the
muscles
of
his
face
assumed
a
contraction
most
peculiarly
virulent
,
and
exhibited
the
character
of
Diogenes
with
a
most
lively
expression
:
he
knew
that
a
confession
of
his
true
situation
would
furnish
Pickle
with
an
opportunity
to
make
reprisals
upon
him
,
with
intolerable
triumph
;
and
that
,
by
a
downright
refusal
to
supply
his
wants
,
he
would
for
ever
forfeit
his
friendship
and
esteem
,
and
might
provoke
him
to
take
ample
vengeance
for
his
sordid
behaviour
,
by
exposing
him
,
in
his
native
colours
,
to
the
resentment
of
those
whom
he
had
so
long
deceived
.
<EOS>
These
considerations
kept
him
some
time
in
a
most
rancorous
state
of
suspence
,
which
Peregrine
affected
to
misinterpret
,
by
bidding
him
freely
declare
his
suspicion
,
if
he
did
not
think
it
safe
to
comply
with
his
request
,
and
he
would
make
shift
elsewhere
.
    
<EOS>
This
seeming
misconstruction
increased
the
torture
of
the
misanthrope
,
who
,
with
the
utmost
irritation
of
feature
,
"
Oons
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
)
<EOS>
what
villainy
have
you
noted
in
my
conduct
,
that
you
treat
me
like
a
rascally
usurer
?
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
very
gravely
replied
,
that
the
question
needed
no
answer
;
"
for
(
said
he
)
had
I
considered
you
as
an
usurer
,
I
would
have
come
with
a
security
under
my
arm
;
but
,
all
evasion
apart
,
will
you
stead
me
?
<EOS>
will
you
pleasure
me
?
<EOS>
shall
I
have
the
money
?
"
<EOS>
"
Would
it
were
in
your
belly
,
with
a
barrel
of
gunpowder
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
enraged
cynic
)
since
I
must
be
excruciated
,
read
that
plaguy
paper
!
 
<EOS>
'
sblood
!
<EOS>
why
did
n't
nature
clap
a
pair
of
long
ears
and
a
tail
upon
me
,
that
I
might
be
a
real
ass
,
and
champ
thistles
on
some
common
,
independent
of
my
fellow
-
creatures
?
<EOS>
Would
I
were
a
worm
,
that
I
might
creep
into
the
earth
,
and
thatch
my
habitation
with
a
single
straw
;
or
rather
a
wasp
or
a
viper
,
that
I
might
make
the
rascally
world
feel
my
resentment
:
<EOS>
but
why
do
I
talk
of
rascality
?
<EOS>
folly
,
folly
is
the
scourge
of
life
!
<EOS>
Give
me
a
scoundrel
<EOS>
(
so
he
be
a
sensible
one
)
and
I
will
put
him
in
my
heart
of
hearts
!
<EOS>
but
a
fool
is
more
mischievous
than
famine
,
pestilence
and
war
.
<EOS>
The
idiotical
hag
that
writes
,
or
causes
to
be
writ
,
this
same
letter
,
has
ruined
her
family
,
and
broke
her
husband
's
heart
,
by
ignorance
and
mismanagement
;
and
she
imputes
her
calamity
to
providence
with
a
vengeance
;
and
so
I
am
defrauded
of
three
hundred
pounds
,
the
greatest
part
of
which
I
owe
to
tradesmen
whom
I
have
promised
to
pay
this
very
quarter
.
<EOS>
Pox
upon
her
!
<EOS>
I
would
she
were
an
horned
beast
,
that
the
distemper
might
lay
hold
on
her
.
<EOS>
The
beldame
has
the
impudence
too
(
after
she
has
brought
me
into
this
dilemma
)
to
solicit
my
assistance
to
stock
the
farm
anew
!
<EOS>
Before
God
,
I
have
a
good
mind
to
send
her
an
halter
,
and
perhaps
I
might
purchase
another
for
myself
,
but
that
I
would
not
furnish
food
for
laughter
to
knaves
and
coxcombs
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
having
perused
the
billet
,
and
listened
to
this
ejaculation
,
replied
with
great
composure
,
that
he
was
ashamed
to
see
a
man
of
his
years
and
pretensions
to
philosophy
,
so
ruffled
by
a
trifle
.
<EOS>
"
What
signify
all
the
boasted
hardships
you
have
overcome
(
said
he
)
and
the
shrewd
observations
you
pretend
to
have
made
on
human
nature
?
<EOS>
Where
is
that
stoical
indifference
you
affirm
you
have
attained
,
if
such
a
paultry
disappointment
can
disturb
you
in
this
manner
?
<EOS>
What
is
the
loss
of
three
hundred
pounds
,
compared
with
the
misfortunes
which
I
myself
have
undergone
within
these
two
years
?
<EOS>
Yet
you
will
take
upon
you
to
act
the
censor
,
and
inveigh
against
the
impatience
and
impetuosity
of
youth
,
as
if
you
yourself
had
gained
an
absolute
conquest
over
all
the
passions
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
You
was
so
kind
as
to
insult
me
t'other
day
in
my
affliction
,
by
reproaching
me
with
indiscretion
and
misconduct
;
suppose
I
were
now
to
retort
the
imputation
,
and
ask
how
a
man
of
your
profound
sagacity
could
leave
your
fortune
at
the
discretion
of
ignorant
peasants
?
<EOS>
How
could
you
be
so
blind
as
not
to
foresee
the
necessity
of
repairs
,
together
with
the
danger
of
a
bankruptcy
,
murrain
,
or
thin
crop
?
<EOS>
Why
did
not
you
convert
your
land
into
ready
money
,
and
(
as
you
have
no
connexions
in
life
)
purchase
an
annuity
,
on
which
you
might
have
lived
at
your
ease
,
without
any
fear
of
the
consequence
?
<EOS>
Ca
n't
you
,
from
the
whole
budget
of
your
philosophy
,
cull
one
apophthegm
to
console
you
in
this
trivial
mischance
?
"
    
<EOS>
"
Rot
your
rapidity
!
<EOS>
(
said
the
cynic
,
half
-
choaked
with
gall
)
<EOS>
if
the
cancer
or
the
pox
were
in
your
throat
,
I
should
not
be
thus
tormented
with
your
tongue
:
and
yet
a
magpye
shall
speak
infinitely
more
to
the
purpose
.
<EOS>
Do
n't
you
know
,
Mr
Wiseacre
,
that
my
case
does
not
fall
within
the
province
of
philosophy
?
<EOS>
Had
I
been
curtailed
of
all
my
members
,
racked
by
the
gout
and
gravel
,
deprived
of
liberty
,
robbed
of
an
only
child
,
or
visited
with
the
death
of
a
dear
friend
like
you
,
philosophy
might
have
contributed
to
my
consolation
;
but
will
philosophy
pay
my
debts
,
or
free
me
from
the
burden
of
obligation
to
a
set
of
fellows
whom
I
despise
?
<EOS>
Speak
 
pronounce
  
demonstrate
 
or
may
heaven
close
your
mouth
for
ever
!
"
    
<EOS>
"
These
are
the
comfortable
fruits
of
your
misanthropy
(
answered
the
youth
)
<EOS>
your
laudable
scheme
of
detaching
yourself
from
the
bonds
of
society
,
and
of
moving
in
a
superior
sphere
of
your
own
.
<EOS>
Had
not
you
been
so
peculiarly
sage
,
and
intent
upon
laughing
at
mankind
,
you
could
never
have
been
disconcerted
by
such
a
pitiful
inconvenience
:
any
friend
would
have
accommodated
you
with
the
sum
in
question
.
<EOS>
But
now
the
world
may
retort
the
laugh
;
for
you
stand
upon
such
an
agreeable
footing
with
your
acquaintance
,
that
nothing
could
please
them
better
than
an
account
of
your
having
given
disappointment
the
slip

by
the
help
of
a
noose
properly
applied

This
I
mention
by
way
of
hint
,
upon
which
I
would
have
you
chew
the
cud
of
reflection
;
and
should
it
come
to
that
issue
,
I
will
use
my
whole
interest
with
the
coroner
,
to
bring
in
his
verdict
Lunacy
,
that
your
carcase
may
have
christian
burial
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
withdrew
,
very
well
satisfied
with
the
revenge
he
had
taken
,
which
operated
so
violently
upon
Crabtree
,
that
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
sole
consideration
mentioned
above
,
he
would
,
in
all
probability
,
have
had
recourse
to
the
remedy
proposed
.
<EOS>
But
his
unwillingness
to
oblige
and
entertain
his
fellow
-
creatures
,
hindered
him
from
practising
that
expedient
,
till
,
by
course
of
post
,
he
was
happily
undeceived
with
regard
to
the
situation
of
his
affairs
;
and
that
information
had
such
an
effect
upon
him
,
that
he
not
only
forgave
our
hero
for
the
stratagem
,
which
he
immediately
ascribed
to
the
right
author
,
but
also
made
him
a
tender
of
his
purse
:
so
that
matters
,
for
the
present
,
were
brought
to
an
amicable
accommodation
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
Peregrine
never
slackened
in
his
attendance
upon
the
great
;
he
never
omitted
to
appear
upon
every
levee
-
day
,
employed
his
industry
and
penetration
in
getting
intelligence
of
posts
that
were
unfilled
,
and
every
day
recommended
himself
to
the
good
offices
of
his
patron
,
who
seemed
to
espouse
his
interest
with
great
cordiality
:
<EOS>
nevertheless
,
he
was
always
too
late
in
his
application
,
or
the
place
he
demanded
chanced
to
be
out
of
the
minister
's
gift
.
    
<EOS>
These
intimations
,
tho
'
communicated
in
the
most
warm
professions
of
friendship
and
regard
,
gave
great
umbrage
to
the
young
gentleman
,
who
considered
them
as
the
evasions
of
an
insincere
courtier
,
and
loudly
complained
of
them
as
such
to
his
lordship
,
signifying
,
at
the
same
time
,
an
intention
to
sell
his
mortgage
for
ready
money
,
which
he
would
expend
to
the
last
farthing
in
thwarting
his
honour
,
in
the
very
first
election
he
should
patronize
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
never
wanted
a
proper
exhortation
upon
these
occasions
:
he
did
not
now
endeavour
to
pacify
him
with
assurances
of
the
minister
's
favour
,
because
he
perceived
that
these
medicines
had
,
by
repeated
use
,
lost
their
effect
upon
our
adventurer
,
whose
menaces
he
now
combated
,
by
representing
that
the
minister
's
purse
was
heavier
than
that
of
Mr
Pickle
<EOS>
;
that
therefore
,
should
he
make
a
point
of
opposing
his
interest
,
the
youth
must
infallibly
fail
in
the
contest
:
in
which
case
he
would
find
himself
utterly
destitute
of
the
means
of
subsistence
,
and
consequently
precluded
from
all
hope
of
provision
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
an
observation
,
the
truth
of
which
our
young
gentleman
could
not
pretend
to
doubt
,
tho
'
<EOS>
it
did
not
at
all
tend
to
the
vindication
of
his
honour
's
conduct
.
<EOS>
Indeed
Pickle
began
to
suspect
the
sincerity
of
his
own
patron
,
who
,
in
his
opinion
,
had
trifled
with
his
impatience
,
and
even
eluded
,
by
sorry
excuses
,
his
desire
of
having
another
private
audience
of
the
first
mover
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
also
began
to
be
less
accessible
than
usual
;
and
Peregrine
had
been
obliged
to
dun
the
steward
with
repeated
demands
,
before
he
could
finger
the
last
quarter
of
his
interest
.
    
<EOS>
Alarmed
by
these
considerations
,
he
went
and
consulted
the
nobleman
whom
he
had
obliged
in
the
affair
of
his
son
;
and
had
the
mortification
to
hear
but
a
very
indifferent
character
of
the
person
in
whom
he
had
so
long
confided
.
<EOS>
This
new
adviser
,
who
(
though
a
courtier
)
was
a
rival
of
the
other
,
gave
our
adventurer
to
understand
,
that
he
had
been
leaning
upon
a
broken
reed
;
that
his
professed
patron
was
a
man
of
a
shattered
fortune
and
decayed
interest
,
which
extended
no
farther
than
a
smile
and
a
whisper
;
that
for
his
own
part
,
he
should
have
been
proud
of
an
opportunity
to
use
his
influence
with
the
minister
in
behalf
of
Mr
Pickle
:
    
<EOS>
"
But
,
since
you
have
put
yourself
under
the
protection
of
another
peer
,
(
said
he
)
whose
connexions
interfere
with
mine
,
I
can
not
now
espouse
your
cause
,
without
incurring
the
imputation
of
seducing
that
nobleman
's
adherents
;
a
charge
which
,
of
all
others
,
I
would
most
carefully
avoid
.
<EOS>
However
,
I
shall
always
be
ready
to
assist
you
with
my
private
advice
,
as
a
specimen
of
which
,
I
now
counsel
you
to
insist
upon
having
another
interview
with
Sir
Steady
Steerwell
himself
,
that
you
may
in
person
explain
your
pretensions
,
without
any
risque
of
being
misrepresented
;
and
endeavour
,
if
possible
,
to
draw
him
into
some
particular
promise
,
from
which
he
can
not
retract
,
with
any
regard
to
his
reputation
:
for
general
profession
is
a
necessary
armour
worn
by
all
ministers
in
their
own
defence
,
against
the
importunity
of
those
whom
they
will
not
befriend
,
and
would
not
disoblige
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
advice
was
so
conformable
to
his
own
sentiments
,
that
our
adventurer
seized
the
first
opportunity
to
demand
an
hearing
;
and
plainly
told
his
patron
,
that
if
he
could
not
be
indulged
with
that
favour
,
he
should
look
upon
his
lordship
's
influence
to
be
very
small
,
and
his
own
hopes
to
be
altogether
desperate
;
in
which
case
,
he
was
resolved
to
dispose
of
the
mortgage
,
purchase
an
annuity
,
and
live
independant
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
C
   
<EOS>
If
the
young
gentleman
's
money
had
been
in
other
hands
,
perhaps
the
peer
would
have
been
at
very
little
pains
,
either
in
gratifying
his
demand
,
or
opposing
his
revenge
;
but
he
knew
that
a
sale
of
the
mortgage
could
not
be
effected
without
an
inquiry
,
to
which
he
did
not
wish
to
be
exposed
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
employed
all
his
interest
in
procuring
the
solicited
audience
;
which
being
granted
,
Peregrine
,
with
great
warmth
and
elocution
,
expatiated
upon
the
injury
his
fortune
had
suffered
in
the
affair
of
the
borough
,
for
which
he
had
stood
candidate
;
he
took
notice
of
the
disappointment
he
had
sustained
in
the
other
election
,
reminded
him
of
the
promises
with
which
he
had
been
amused
,
and
in
conclusion
,
desired
to
know
what
he
had
to
expect
from
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
The
minister
having
patiently
heard
him
to
an
end
,
replied
with
a
most
gracious
aspect
,
that
he
was
very
well
informed
of
his
merit
and
attachment
,
and
very
much
disposed
to
convince
him
of
the
regard
which
he
paid
to
both
;
that
till
of
late
,
he
did
not
know
the
nature
of
his
expectations
,
neither
had
he
the
power
of
creating
posts
for
those
whom
he
was
inclined
to
serve
;
but
if
Mr
Pickle
would
chalk
out
any
feasible
method
,
by
which
he
could
manifest
his
sentiments
of
friendship
,
he
should
not
be
backward
in
executing
the
plan
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
laying
hold
on
this
declaration
,
mentioned
several
places
which
he
knew
to
be
vacant
;
but
the
old
evasion
was
still
used
:
one
of
them
was
not
in
his
department
of
business
;
another
had
been
promised
to
the
third
-
son
of
a
certain
earl
,
before
the
death
of
the
last
possessor
;
and
a
third
was
incumbered
with
a
pension
that
ate
up
a
good
half
of
the
appointments
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
such
obstructions
were
started
to
all
his
proposals
,
as
he
could
not
possibly
surmount
;
though
he
plainly
perceived
,
they
were
no
other
than
specious
pretexts
to
cover
the
mortifying
side
of
a
refusal
.
<EOS>
Exasperated
,
therefore
,
at
this
lack
of
sincerity
and
gratitude
,
"
I
can
easily
foresee
,
(
said
he
)
that
such
difficulties
will
never
be
wanting
,
when
I
have
any
thing
to
ask
;
and
for
that
reason
,
will
save
myself
the
trouble
of
any
farther
application
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
withdrew
in
a
very
abrupt
manner
,
breathing
defiance
and
revenge
.
<EOS>
But
this
patron
,
who
did
not
think
proper
to
drive
him
to
extremities
,
found
means
to
persuade
his
honour
,
to
do
something
for
the
pacification
of
the
young
man
's
choler
:
and
that
same
evening
our
adventurer
received
a
message
from
his
lordship
,
desiring
to
see
him
immediately
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
intimation
,
Pickle
went
to
his
house
,
and
appeared
before
him
with
a
very
cloudy
aspect
,
which
signified
to
whom
it
might
concern
,
that
his
temper
was
at
present
too
much
galled
to
endure
reproof
;
and
therefore
the
sagacious
peer
forbore
taking
him
to
task
for
his
behaviour
during
the
audience
he
had
obtained
;
but
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
the
minister
,
in
consideration
of
his
services
,
had
sent
him
a
bank
-
note
for
three
hundred
pounds
,
with
a
promise
of
the
like
sum
yearly
,
until
he
could
be
otherwise
provided
for
.
<EOS>
This
declaration
in
some
measure
appeased
the
youth
,
who
condescended
to
accept
the
present
;
and
next
levee
-
day
,
made
his
acknowledgment
to
the
donor
,
who
favoured
him
with
a
smile
of
infinite
complacency
,
which
intirely
dissipated
all
the
remains
of
his
resentment
;
for
,
as
he
could
not
possibly
divine
the
true
cause
of
his
being
temporized
with
,
he
looked
upon
his
condescension
as
an
undoubted
proof
of
Sir
Steady
's
sincerity
,
and
firmly
believed
,
that
he
would
settle
him
in
some
place
with
the
first
opportunity
,
rather
than
continue
to
pay
this
pension
out
of
his
own
pocket
.
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
this
prediction
would
have
been
verified
,
had
not
an
unforeseen
accident
in
a
moment
overwhelmed
the
bark
of
his
interest
at
court
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
this
short
gleam
of
good
fortune
recalled
the
ideas
of
pride
and
ambition
,
which
he
had
formerly
cherished
.
<EOS>
His
countenance
was
again
lifted
up
,
his
good
humour
retrieved
,
and
his
mien
re
-
exalted
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
began
to
be
considered
as
a
rising
man
by
his
fellow
-
dependants
,
who
saw
the
particular
notice
with
which
he
was
favoured
at
the
public
levee
;
and
some
of
them
,
for
that
reason
,
were
at
pains
to
court
his
good
graces
.
<EOS>
He
no
longer
shunned
his
former
intimates
,
with
whom
a
good
part
of
his
fortune
had
been
spent
,
but
made
up
to
them
in
all
places
of
public
resort
,
with
the
same
ease
and
familiarity
as
he
had
been
used
to
express
,
and
even
reimbarked
in
some
of
their
excesses
,
upon
the
strength
of
his
sanguine
expectation
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
<EOS>
and
he
renewed
their
consultations
in
the
court
of
ridicule
;
and
divers
exploits
were
atchieved
,
to
the
confusion
of
those
who
had
sailed
into
the
North
of
their
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
But
these
enjoyments
were
soon
interrupted
by
a
misfortune
equally
fatal
and
unexpected
:
his
noble
patron
was
seized
with
an
apoplectic
fit
,
from
which
he
was
recovered
by
the
physicians
,
that
they
might
dispatch
him
according
to
rule
;
and
accordingly
,
in
two
months
after
they
were
called
,
he
went
the
way
of
all
flesh
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
very
much
afflicted
at
this
event
,
not
only
on
account
of
his
friendship
for
the
deceased
,
to
whom
he
thought
himself
under
many
and
great
obligations
,
but
also
,
because
he
feared
that
his
own
interest
would
suffer
a
severe
shock
,
by
the
removal
of
this
nobleman
,
whom
he
considered
as
its
chief
support
.
<EOS>
He
put
himself
therefore
in
mourning
,
out
of
regard
to
the
memory
of
his
departed
friend
,
and
exhibited
genuine
marks
of
sorrow
and
concern
;
though
he
had
,
in
reality
,
more
cause
to
grieve
than
he
as
yet
imagined
.
    
<EOS>
When
quarter
day
came
about
,
he
applied
to
the
steward
of
his
lordship
's
heir
for
the
interest
of
his
money
,
as
usual
;
and
the
reader
will
readily
own
he
had
some
reason
to
be
surprized
,
when
he
was
told
he
had
no
claim
either
to
principal
or
interest
.
<EOS>
True
it
is
,
the
manager
talked
very
civilly
as
well
as
sensibly
on
the
subject
.
    
<EOS>
"
Your
appearance
,
Sir
,
(
said
he
to
Pickle
)
screens
you
from
all
suspicion
of
an
intended
fraud
;
but
the
mortgage
upon
those
lands
you
mention
,
was
granted
to
another
person
many
years
before
you
pretend
to
have
lent
that
sum
;
and
I
have
,
<EOS>
this
very
morning
,
paid
one
quarter
's
interest
,
as
appears
from
this
receipt
,
which
you
may
peruse
for
your
satisfaction
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
so
thunder
-
struck
at
this
information
,
which
stripped
him
of
his
all
,
that
he
could
not
utter
one
word
;
a
circumstance
that
did
no
great
honour
to
his
character
,
in
the
opinion
of
the
steward
,
who
,
in
good
earnest
,
began
to
entertain
some
doubts
of
his
integrity
:
for
,
among
the
papers
of
the
deceased
,
which
he
had
examined
,
there
was
no
writing
,
memorandum
,
or
receipt
,
relating
to
this
incumbrance
.
<EOS>
After
a
long
pause
of
stupefaction
,
Peregrine
recollected
himself
so
far
,
as
to
observe
,
that
either
he
was
egregiously
mistaken
,
or
the
predecessor
of
his
lord
the
greatest
villain
upon
earth
.
"
<EOS>
But
,
Mr
Whatdyecallum
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
you
must
give
me
leave
to
tell
you
,
that
your
bare
assertion
,
in
this
affair
,
will
by
no
means
induce
me
to
put
up
quietly
with
the
loss
of
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
expressed
himself
,
he
retired
from
the
house
,
so
discontented
at
this
demur
,
that
he
scarce
knew
whether
he
moved
upon
his
head
or
heels
;
and
the
park
chancing
to
lie
in
his
way
<EOS>
,
he
sauntered
about
,
giving
vent
to
a
soliloquy
in
praise
of
his
departed
friend
,
the
burden
of
which
was
a
string
of
incoherent
curses
imprecated
upon
himself
;
till
his
transports
,
by
degrees
,
giving
way
to
his
reflection
,
he
deliberated
seriously
and
sorrowfully
upon
his
misfortune
,
and
resolved
to
consult
lawyers
,
without
loss
of
time
.
<EOS>
But
,
first
of
all
,
he
proposed
to
make
personal
application
to
the
heir
,
who
,
by
a
candid
representation
of
the
case
,
might
be
inclined
to
do
him
justice
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
determination
,
he
next
morning
put
his
writings
in
his
pocket
,
and
went
in
a
chair
to
the
house
of
the
young
nobleman
,
to
whom
being
admitted
by
virtue
of
his
appearance
,
and
a
small
gratification
to
the
porter
,
he
explained
the
whole
affair
,
corroborating
his
assertions
with
the
papers
which
he
produced
,
and
describing
the
disgrace
that
would
be
intailed
upon
the
memory
of
the
deceased
,
should
he
be
obliged
to
seek
redress
in
a
public
court
of
justice
.
    
<EOS>
The
executor
,
who
was
a
person
of
good
breeding
,
condoled
him
upon
his
loss
with
great
good
nature
,
though
he
did
not
seem
much
surprized
at
his
account
of
the
matter
;
but
wished
,
that
since
the
fraud
must
have
been
committed
,
the
damage
had
fallen
upon
the
first
mortgager
,
who
(
he
said
)
was
a
thievish
usurer
,
grown
rich
by
the
distresses
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
In
answer
to
our
hero
's
remonstrances
,
he
observed
,
that
he
did
not
look
upon
himself
as
obliged
to
pay
the
least
regard
to
the
character
of
his
predecessor
,
who
had
used
him
with
great
barbarity
and
injustice
,
not
only
in
excluding
him
from
his
countenance
and
assistance
,
but
also
in
prejudicing
his
inheritance
,
as
much
as
lay
in
his
power
;
so
that
it
could
not
be
reasonably
expected
,
that
he
would
pay
ten
thousand
pounds
of
his
debt
,
for
which
he
had
received
no
value
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
spite
of
his
chagrin
,
could
not
help
owning
within
himself
,
that
there
was
a
good
deal
of
reason
in
this
refusal
;
and
after
having
given
loose
to
his
indignation
,
in
the
most
violent
invectives
against
the
defunct
,
took
his
leave
of
the
complaisant
heir
,
and
had
immediate
recourse
to
the
advice
of
counsel
,
who
assured
him
that
he
had
an
excellent
plea
,
and
was
accordingly
retained
in
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
All
these
measures
were
taken
in
the
first
vigour
of
his
exertion
,
during
which
his
spirits
were
so
flustered
with
the
diversity
of
passions
produced
by
his
mischance
,
that
he
mistook
for
equanimity
that
which
was
no
other
than
intoxication
;
and
two
whole
days
elapsed
,
before
he
arrived
at
a
due
sense
of
his
misfortune
.
<EOS>
Then
indeed
he
underwent
a
woeful
self
-
examination
;
every
circumstance
of
the
inquiry
added
fresh
pangs
to
his
reflection
;
and
the
result
of
the
whole
was
a
discovery
,
that
his
fortune
was
totally
consumed
,
and
himself
reduced
to
a
state
of
the
most
deplorable
dependance
.
<EOS>
This
suggestion
alone
might
(
in
the
anguish
of
his
despondency
)
have
driven
him
to
some
desperate
course
,
had
not
it
been
in
some
measure
qualified
by
the
confidence
of
his
lawyers
,
and
the
assurance
of
the
minister
,
which
(
slender
as
the
world
hath
generally
found
them
)
were
the
only
bulwarks
between
misery
and
him
.
    
<EOS>
The
mind
is
naturally
pliable
,
and
,
provided
it
has
the
least
hope
to
lean
upon
,
adapts
itself
wonderfully
to
the
emergencies
of
fortune
,
especially
when
the
imagination
is
gay
and
luxuriant
.
<EOS>
This
was
the
case
with
our
adventurer
;
instead
of
indulging
the
melancholy
ideas
which
his
loss
inspired
,
he
had
recourse
to
the
flattering
delusions
of
hope
,
soothing
himself
with
unsubstantial
plans
of
future
greatness
,
and
endeavouring
to
cover
what
was
past
with
the
veil
of
oblivion
.
    
<EOS>
After
some
hesitation
,
he
resolved
to
make
Crabtree
acquainted
with
his
misfortune
,
that
once
for
all
he
might
pass
the
ordeal
of
his
satire
,
without
subjecting
himself
to
a
long
series
of
sarcastic
hints
and
doubtful
allusions
,
which
he
could
not
endure
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
took
the
first
opportunity
of
telling
him
,
that
he
was
absolutely
ruined
by
the
perfidy
of
his
patron
,
and
desired
that
he
would
not
aggravate
his
affliction
,
by
those
cynical
remarks
which
were
peculiar
to
men
of
his
misanthropical
disposition
.
<EOS>
Cadwallader
listened
to
this
declaration
with
internal
surprize
,
which
,
however
,
produced
no
alteration
in
his
countenance
;
and
,
after
some
pause
,
observed
,
that
our
hero
had
no
reason
to
look
for
any
new
observation
from
him
upon
this
event
,
which
he
had
long
foreseen
,
and
daily
expected
;
and
exhorted
him
,
with
an
ironical
sneer
,
to
console
himself
with
the
promise
of
the
minister
,
who
would
doubtless
discharge
the
debts
of
his
deceased
bosom
-
friend
.

Chapter
CI
Peregrine
commits
himself
to
the
publick
,
and
is
admitted
member
of
a
college
of
authors
.
   
<EOS>
The
bitterness
of
this
explanation
being
passed
,
our
young
gentleman
began
to
revolve
within
himself
schemes
for
making
up
the
deficiencies
of
his
yearly
income
,
which
was
now
so
grievously
reduced
,
and
determined
to
profit
,
in
some
shape
or
other
,
by
those
talents
which
he
owed
to
nature
and
education
.
<EOS>
He
had
,
in
his
affluence
,
heard
of
several
authors
,
who
,
without
any
pretensions
to
genius
,
or
human
literature
,
earned
a
very
genteel
subsistence
,
by
undertaking
work
for
booksellers
,
in
which
reputation
was
not
at
all
concerned
.
    
<EOS>
One
(
for
example
)
professed
all
manner
of
translation
,
at
so
much
per
sheet
,
and
actually
kept
five
or
six
amanuenses
continually
employed
,
like
so
many
clerks
in
a
compting
-
house
;
by
which
means
,
he
was
enabled
to
live
at
his
ease
,
and
enjoy
his
friend
and
his
bottle
,
ambitious
of
no
other
character
than
that
of
an
honest
man
,
and
a
good
neighbour
.
<EOS>
Another
projected
a
variety
of
plans
for
new
dictionaries
,
which
were
executed
under
his
eye
by
day
-
labourers
;
and
the
province
of
a
third
was
history
and
voyages
,
collected
or
abridged
by
understrappers
of
the
same
class
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Pickle
,
in
his
comparisons
,
paid
such
deference
to
his
own
capacity
,
as
banished
all
doubts
of
his
being
able
to
excel
any
of
those
undertakers
,
in
their
different
branches
of
profession
,
if
ever
he
should
be
driven
to
that
experiment
:
but
his
ambition
prompted
him
to
make
his
interest
and
glory
coincide
,
by
attempting
some
performance
which
should
do
him
honour
with
the
publick
,
and
at
the
same
time
establish
his
importance
among
the
copy
-
purchasers
in
town
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
worshipped
the
muse
;
and
,
conscious
of
the
little
regard
which
is
,
in
this
age
,
paid
to
every
species
of
poetic
composition
,
in
which
neither
satire
nor
obscenity
occurs
,
he
produced
an
imitation
of
Juvenal
,
and
lashed
some
conspicuous
characters
,
with
equal
truth
,
spirit
,
and
severity
.
<EOS>
Though
his
name
did
not
appear
in
the
title
-
page
of
this
production
,
he
managed
matters
so
,
as
that
the
work
was
universally
imputed
to
the
true
author
,
who
was
not
altogether
disappointed
in
his
expectations
of
success
;
for
the
impression
was
immediately
sold
off
,
and
the
piece
became
the
subject
of
conversation
in
all
assemblies
of
taste
.
    
<EOS>
This
happy
exordium
not
only
attracted
the
addresses
of
the
booksellers
,
who
made
interest
for
his
acquaintance
,
but
also
roused
the
notice
of
a
society
of
authors
,
who
stiled
themselves
the
college
,
from
which
he
was
honoured
with
a
deputation
,
offering
to
enroll
him
a
member
,
by
unanimous
consent
.
<EOS>
The
person
employed
for
this
purpose
being
a
bard
who
had
formerly
tasted
of
our
hero
's
bounty
,
used
all
his
eloquence
to
persuade
him
to
comply
with
the
advances
of
their
fraternity
,
which
he
described
in
such
a
manner
,
as
inflamed
the
curiosity
of
Pickle
,
who
dismissed
the
embassador
,
with
an
acknowledgement
of
the
great
honour
they
conferred
upon
him
,
and
a
faithful
promise
of
endeavouring
to
merit
the
continuance
of
their
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
afterwards
,
by
the
same
minister
,
instructed
in
the
ceremonies
of
the
college
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
his
information
,
composed
an
ode
,
to
be
publickly
recited
on
the
evening
of
his
introduction
.
<EOS>
He
understood
,
that
this
constitution
was
no
other
than
a
body
of
authors
,
incorporated
by
mutual
consent
,
for
their
joint
advantage
and
satisfaction
,
opposed
to
another
assembly
of
the
same
kind
,
their
avowed
enemies
and
detractors
.
<EOS>
No
wonder
then
,
that
they
sought
to
strengthen
themselves
with
such
a
valuable
acquisition
as
our
hero
was
like
to
prove
.
<EOS>
The
college
consisted
of
authors
only
,
and
these
of
all
degrees
in
point
of
reputation
,
from
the
fabricator
of
a
song
set
to
music
,
and
sung
at
Marybone
,
to
the
dramatic
bard
who
had
appeared
in
buskins
upon
the
stage
:
nay
,
one
of
the
members
had
actually
finished
eight
books
of
an
epic
poem
,
for
the
publication
of
which
,
he
was
,
at
that
time
,
soliciting
subscriptions
.
    
<EOS>
It
can
not
be
supposed
that
such
a
congregation
of
the
sons
of
Apollo
would
sit
a
whole
evening
with
order
and
decorum
,
unless
they
were
under
the
check
of
some
established
authority
:
and
this
inconvenience
having
been
foreseen
<EOS>
,
they
had
elected
a
president
,
vested
with
full
power
to
silence
any
member
or
members
,
that
should
attempt
to
disturb
the
harmony
and
subordination
of
the
whole
.
<EOS>
The
sage
,
who
at
this
time
possessed
the
chair
,
was
a
person
in
years
,
whose
countenance
was
a
lively
portraiture
of
that
rancorous
discontent
which
follows
repeated
damnation
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
extremely
unfortunate
in
his
theatrical
productions
,
and
was
(
to
use
the
words
of
a
prophane
wag
,
who
assisted
at
the
condemnation
of
his
last
play
)
by
this
time
damn'd
beyond
redemption
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
he
still
tarried
about
the
skirts
of
Parnassus
,
translating
some
of
the
classics
,
and
writing
miscellanies
;
and
,
by
dint
of
an
invincible
assurance
,
insolence
untamed
,
the
most
undaunted
virulence
of
tongue
,
and
some
knowledge
of
life
,
he
made
shift
to
acquire
and
maintain
the
character
of
a
man
of
learning
and
wit
,
in
the
opinion
of
people
who
had
neither
;
that
is
,
thirty
-
nine
in
forty
of
those
with
whom
he
associated
himself
.
<EOS>
He
was
even
looked
upon
in
this
light
by
some
few
of
the
college
;
though
the
major
part
of
those
who
favoured
his
election
,
were
such
as
dreaded
his
malice
,
respected
his
experience
and
seniority
,
or
hated
his
competitor
,
who
was
the
epic
poet
.
    
<EOS>
The
chief
end
of
this
society
(
as
I
have
already
hinted
)
was
to
assist
and
support
each
other
in
their
productions
,
which
they
mutually
recommended
to
sale
,
with
all
their
art
and
influence
,
not
only
in
private
conversation
,
but
also
in
occasional
epigrams
,
criticisms
,
and
advertisements
inserted
in
the
public
papers
.
    
<EOS>
This
science
,
which
is
known
by
the
vulgar
appellation
of
puffing
,
they
carried
to
such
a
pitch
of
finesse
,
that
an
author
very
often
wrote
an
abusive
answer
to
his
own
performance
,
in
order
to
inflame
the
curiosity
of
the
town
,
by
which
it
had
been
overlook'd
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
general
unanimity
in
the
college
,
a
private
animosity
had
long
subsisted
between
the
two
rivals
I
have
mentioned
,
on
account
of
precedence
,
to
which
both
laid
claim
,
though
,
by
a
majority
of
votes
,
it
had
been
decided
in
favour
of
the
present
chairman
.
<EOS>
The
grudge
indeed
never
proceeded
to
any
degree
of
outrage
or
defiance
,
but
manifested
itself
at
every
meeting
,
in
attempts
to
eclipse
each
other
in
smart
sayings
and
pregnant
repartee
;
so
that
there
was
always
a
delicate
mess
of
this
kind
of
wit
served
up
in
the
front
of
the
evening
,
for
the
entertainment
and
example
of
the
junior
members
,
who
never
failed
to
divide
upon
this
occasion
,
declaring
themselves
for
one
or
other
of
the
combatants
,
whom
they
encouraged
by
their
looks
,
gestures
,
and
applause
,
according
to
the
circumstances
of
the
dispute
.
    
<EOS>
This
honourable
consistory
was
held
in
the
best
room
of
an
ale
-
house
,
which
afforded
wine
,
punch
,
or
beer
,
suitable
to
the
purse
or
inclination
of
every
individual
,
who
separately
paid
for
his
own
choice
:
and
here
was
our
hero
introduced
,
in
the
midst
of
twenty
strangers
,
who
,
by
their
looks
and
equipage
,
formed
a
very
picturesque
variety
.
<EOS>
He
was
received
with
a
most
gracious
solemnity
,
and
placed
upon
the
right
hand
of
the
president
,
who
having
commanded
silence
,
recited
aloud
his
introductory
ode
,
which
met
with
universal
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
Then
was
tendered
to
him
the
customary
oath
,
obliging
him
to
consult
the
honour
and
advantage
of
the
society
,
as
far
as
it
should
lie
in
his
power
,
in
every
station
of
life
:
and
this
being
taken
,
his
temples
were
bound
with
a
wreath
of
laurel
,
which
was
kept
sacred
for
such
inauguration
.
    
<EOS>
When
these
rites
were
performed
with
all
due
ceremony
,
the
new
member
cast
his
eyes
around
the
place
,
and
took
a
more
accurate
survey
of
his
brethren
;
among
whom
he
observed
a
strange
collection
of
periwigs
,
with
regard
to
the
colour
,
fashion
,
and
dimensions
,
which
were
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
.
<EOS>
Those
who
sat
on
each
side
,
nearest
the
president
,
were
generally
distinguished
by
venerable
tyes
,
the
foretops
of
which
exhibited
a
surprising
diversity
;
some
of
them
rose
slanting
backwards
,
like
the
glacis
of
a
fortification
;
some
were
elevated
in
two
distinct
eminences
,
like
the
hills
Helicon
and
Parnassus
;
and
others
were
curled
and
reflected
,
as
the
horns
of
Jupiter
Ammon
.
<EOS>
Next
to
these
,
the
majors
took
place
,
many
of
which
were
mere
succedanea
,
made
by
the
application
of
an
occasional
rose
to
the
tail
of
a
lank
bob
;
and
in
the
lower
form
appeared
masses
of
hair
,
which
would
admit
of
no
description
.
    
<EOS>
Their
cloaths
were
tolerably
well
suited
to
the
furniture
of
their
heads
,
the
apparel
of
the
upper
bench
being
decent
and
clean
,
while
that
of
the
second
class
was
thread
-
bare
and
soiled
;
and
at
the
lower
end
of
the
room
,
he
perceived
divers
efforts
made
to
conceal
rent
breeches
and
dirty
linen
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
could
distinguish
by
their
countenances
,
the
different
kinds
of
poetry
in
which
they
exercised
the
muse
;
he
saw
Tragedy
conspicuous
in
a
grave
solemnity
of
regard
,
Satire
louring
in
a
frown
of
envy
and
discontent
,
Elegy
whining
in
a
funeral
aspect
,
<EOS>
Pastoral
dozing
in
a
most
insipid
languor
of
face
<EOS>
,
Ode
-
writing
delineated
in
a
distracted
stare
,
and
Epigram
squinting
with
a
pert
sneer
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
our
hero
refined
too
much
in
his
penetration
,
when
he
affirmed
,
that
over
and
above
these
discoveries
,
he
could
plainly
perceive
the
state
of
every
one
's
finances
,
and
would
have
undertaken
to
have
guessed
each
particular
sum
,
without
varying
three
farthings
from
the
truth
.
    
<EOS>
The
conversation
,
instead
of
becoming
general
,
began
to
fall
into
parties
;
and
the
epic
poet
had
actually
attracted
the
attention
of
a
private
committee
,
when
the
chairman
interposed
,
calling
aloud
,
"
No
cabals
,
no
conspiracies
,
gentleman
.
"
<EOS>
His
rival
,
thinking
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
make
some
reply
to
this
rebuke
,
answered
,
"
We
have
no
secrets
;
he
that
hath
ears
,
let
him
hear
.
<EOS>
"
This
was
spoke
as
an
intimation
to
the
company
,
whose
looks
were
instantly
whetted
with
the
expectation
of
their
ordinary
meal
:
but
the
president
seemed
to
decline
the
contest
;
for
,
without
putting
on
his
fighting
face
,
he
calmly
replied
,
that
he
had
seen
Mr
Metaphor
tip
the
wink
,
and
whisper
to
one
of
his
confederates
;
and
thence
judged
,
that
there
was
something
mysterious
on
the
carpet
.
    
<EOS>
The
epic
poet
,
believing
his
antagonist
crestfallen
,
resolved
to
take
the
advantage
of
his
dejection
,
that
he
might
inhance
his
own
character
in
the
opinion
of
the
stranger
;
and
with
that
view
asked
,
with
an
air
of
exultation
,
if
a
man
might
not
be
allowed
to
have
a
convulsion
in
his
eye
,
without
being
suspected
of
a
conspiracy
.
    
<EOS>
The
president
,
perceiving
his
drift
,
and
piqued
at
his
presumption
,
"
To
be
sure
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
a
man
of
a
weak
head
may
be
very
well
supposed
to
have
convulsions
in
his
eyes
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
repartee
produced
a
laugh
of
triumph
among
the
chairman
's
adherents
;
one
of
whom
observed
,
that
his
rival
had
got
a
smart
rap
on
the
pate
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
(
replied
the
bard
)
in
that
respect
Mr
Chairman
has
the
advantage
of
me
.
<EOS>
Had
my
head
been
fortified
with
a
horn
-
work
,
I
should
not
have
been
so
sensible
of
the
stroke
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
This
retort
,
which
carried
a
severe
allusion
to
the
president
's
wife
,
lighted
up
the
countenances
of
the
aggressor
's
friends
,
which
had
begun
to
be
a
little
obumbrated
;
and
had
a
contrary
effect
upon
the
other
faction
,
till
their
chief
,
collecting
all
his
capacity
,
returned
the
salute
,
by
observing
,
that
there
was
no
occasion
for
an
horn
-
work
,
when
the
covered
way
was
not
worth
defending
.
    
<EOS>
Such
a
reprizal
upon
Mr
Metaphor
's
yokefellow
,
who
was
by
no
means
remarkable
for
her
beauty
,
could
not
fail
to
operate
upon
the
hearers
;
and
as
for
the
bard
himself
,
he
was
evidently
ruffled
by
the
reflection
;
to
which
,
however
,
he
,
without
hesitation
,
replied
,
"
Egad
!
'
<EOS>
tis
my
opinion
,
that
if
your
covered
way
was
laid
open
,
few
people
would
venture
to
give
the
assault
.
"
<EOS>
"
Not
unless
their
batteries
were
more
effectual
than
the
fire
of
your
wit
,
"
(
said
the
president
.
)
<EOS>
"
As
for
that
matter
,
(
cried
the
other
with
precipitation
)
<EOS>
they
would
have
no
occasion
to
batter
in
breach
;
they
would
find
the
angle
of
the
la
pucelle
bastion
demolished
to
their
hands
:
<EOS>
he
he
!
"
<EOS>
"
But
I
believe
it
would
surpass
your
understanding
,
(
resumed
the
chairman
)
to
fill
up
the
foss
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
,
I
own
,
is
impracticable
,
(
replied
the
bard
)
there
<EOS>
I
should
meet
with
an
hiatus
maxime
deflendus
!
"
    
<EOS>
The
president
,
exasperated
at
this
insinuation
,
in
presence
of
the
new
member
,
exclaimed
with
indignation
in
his
looks
,
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
if
a
body
of
pioneers
were
set
at
work
upon
your
skull
,
they
would
find
rubbish
enough
to
choak
up
all
the
common
sewers
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Here
a
groan
was
uttered
by
the
admirers
of
the
epic
poet
,
who
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
with
great
composure
,
"
When
a
man
grows
scurrilous
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
take
it
for
an
undoubted
proof
of
his
overthrow
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
,
(
cried
the
other
)
<EOS>
you
yourself
must
be
the
vanquished
party
;
for
you
was
the
first
that
was
driven
to
personal
abuse
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
appeal
(
answered
the
bard
)
to
those
who
can
distinguish
.
<EOS>
Gentlemen
,
your
judgment
?
"
    
<EOS>
This
reference
produced
an
universal
clamour
,
and
the
whole
college
was
involved
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
Every
man
entered
into
dispute
with
his
neighbour
,
on
the
merits
of
this
cause
.
<EOS>
The
chairman
interposed
his
authority
in
vain
;
the
noise
grew
louder
and
louder
;
the
disputants
waxed
warm
;
the
epithets
of
blockhead
,
fool
,
and
scoundrel
were
bandied
about
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
enjoyed
the
uproar
,
and
leaping
upon
the
table
,
sounded
the
charge
to
battle
,
which
was
immediately
commenced
in
ten
different
duels
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
lights
were
extinguished
;
the
combatants
threshed
one
another
without
distinction
;
the
mischievous
Pickle
distributed
sundry
random
blows
in
the
dark
;
and
the
people
below
,
being
alarmed
with
the
sound
of
application
,
the
overturning
of
chairs
,
and
the
outcries
of
those
who
were
engaged
,
came
up
stairs
in
a
body
,
with
lights
,
to
reconnoitre
,
and
,
if
possible
,
quell
this
hideous
tumult
.
    
<EOS>
Objects
were
no
sooner
rendered
visible
,
than
the
field
of
battle
exhibited
strange
groupes
of
the
standing
and
the
fallen
.
<EOS>
Each
of
Mr
Metaphor
's
eyes
was
surrounded
with
a
circle
of
a
livid
hue
;
and
the
president
's
nose
distilled
a
quantity
of
clotted
blood
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
tragic
authors
,
finding
himself
assaulted
in
the
dark
,
had
,
by
way
of
poinard
,
employed
upon
his
adversary
's
throat
a
knife
which
lay
upon
the
table
,
for
the
convenience
of
cutting
cheese
;
but
,
by
the
blessing
of
God
,
the
edge
of
it
was
not
keen
enough
to
enter
the
skin
,
which
it
had
only
scratched
in
divers
places
.
<EOS>
A
satirist
had
almost
bit
off
the
ear
of
a
lyric
bard
.
<EOS>
Shirts
and
neckcloaths
were
torn
to
rags
;
and
there
was
such
a
woeful
wreck
of
periwigs
on
the
floor
,
that
no
examination
could
adjust
the
property
of
the
owners
,
the
greatest
part
of
whom
were
obliged
to
use
handkerchiefs
,
by
way
of
night
-
cap
.
    
<EOS>
The
fray
,
however
,
ceased
at
the
approach
of
those
who
interposed
;
part
of
the
combatants
being
tired
of
an
exercise
,
in
which
they
had
received
nothing
but
hard
blows
;
part
of
them
being
intimidated
by
the
remonstrances
of
the
landlord
and
his
company
,
who
threatened
to
call
the
watch
;
and
a
very
few
being
ashamed
of
the
scandalous
dispute
in
which
they
were
detected
.
<EOS>
But
though
the
battle
was
ended
,
it
was
impossible
,
for
that
evening
,
to
restore
harmony
and
good
order
to
the
society
,
which
broke
up
,
after
the
president
had
pronounced
a
short
and
confused
apology
to
our
adventurer
,
for
the
indecent
uproar
which
had
unfortunately
happened
on
the
first
night
of
his
admission
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
Peregrine
deliberated
with
himself
,
whether
or
not
his
reputation
would
allow
him
to
appear
again
among
this
venerable
fraternity
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
knew
some
of
them
to
be
men
of
real
genius
,
how
ridiculous
soever
their
carriage
might
be
modified
,
and
was
of
that
laughing
disposition
,
which
is
always
seeking
food
for
mirth
,
as
Horace
observes
of
Philippus
,
Risus
undique
quaerit
;
    
he
resolved
to
frequent
the
college
,
notwithstanding
this
accident
,
which
happened
at
his
inauguration
;
being
thereto
,
moreover
,
induced
by
his
desire
of
knowing
the
private
history
of
the
stage
,
with
which
he
supposed
some
of
the
members
perfectly
well
acquainted
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
visited
,
before
the
next
meeting
,
by
his
introductor
,
who
assured
him
,
that
such
a
tumult
had
never
happened
since
the
institution
of
the
assembly
,
till
that
very
night
;
and
promised
,
that
for
the
future
,
he
should
have
no
cause
to
be
scandalized
at
their
behaviour
.
    
<EOS>
Persuaded
by
these
motives
and
assurances
,
he
trusted
himself
once
more
in
the
midst
of
their
community
,
and
every
thing
proceeded
with
great
decorum
;
all
dispute
and
altercation
was
avoided
,
and
the
college
applied
itself
seriously
to
the
purposes
of
its
meeting
;
namely
,
to
hear
the
grievances
of
individuals
,
and
assist
them
with
salutary
advice
.
<EOS>
The
first
person
that
craved
redress
,
was
a
noisy
North
Briton
,
who
complained
(
in
a
strange
dialect
)
that
he
had
,
in
the
beginning
of
the
season
,
presented
a
comedy
to
the
manager
of
a
certain
theatre
,
who
,
after
it
had
lain
six
weeks
in
his
hands
,
returned
it
to
the
author
,
affirming
there
was
neither
sense
nor
English
in
the
performance
.
    
<EOS>
The
president
,
(
who
,
by
the
bye
)
had
revised
the
piece
)
thinking
his
own
reputation
concerned
,
declared
,
in
presence
of
the
whole
society
,
that
with
regard
to
sense
,
he
would
not
undertake
to
vindicate
the
production
;
but
,
in
point
of
language
,
no
fault
could
be
justly
laid
to
its
charge
:
"
The
case
,
however
,
is
very
plain
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
the
manager
never
gave
himself
the
trouble
to
peruse
the
play
,
but
formed
a
judgment
of
it
from
the
conversation
of
the
author
,
never
dreaming
that
it
had
undergone
the
revisal
of
an
English
writer
:
<EOS>
be
that
as
it
will
,
you
are
infinitely
obliged
to
him
,
for
having
dispatched
you
so
soon
,
and
I
shall
have
the
better
opinion
of
him
for
it
so
long
as
I
live
;
for
I
have
know
other
-
guess
authors
than
you
(
that
is
,
in
point
of
interest
and
fame
)
kept
in
continual
attendance
and
dependance
during
the
best
part
of
their
lives
,
and
after
all
,
disappointed
in
the
expectation
of
seeing
their
performances
exhibited
on
the
stage
.
<EOS>
There
are
only
two
methods
,
by
which
you
have
any
chance
of
introducing
your
play
upon
the
theatre
;
one
is
compulsive
,
by
the
interposition
of
the
great
,
whom
a
patentee
dares
not
disoblige
;
the
other
,
insinuation
,
by
ingratiating
yourself
with
the
manager
:
you
must
be
recommended
to
his
notice
;
you
must
cultivate
his
good
graces
with
all
the
humility
of
adulation
;
write
poems
in
his
praise
;
if
he
be
an
actor
,
support
his
performance
against
all
censure
,
though
it
should
be
founded
upon
demonstration
;
and
in
public
coffee
-
houses
,
as
well
as
in
private
parties
,
magnify
the
virtues
of
his
heart
,
in
despite
of
truth
and
illustration
.
    
<EOS>
This
,
indeed
,
is
the
most
effectual
expedient
,
and
what
I
advise
you
to
practise
,
after
you
shall
have
been
introduced
to
his
acquaintance
,
by
some
person
of
weight
;
and
if
,
by
these
means
,
and
dint
of
perseverance
,
you
can
,
in
three
or
four
years
,
see
your
comedy
in
rehearsal
,
you
may
think
yourself
extremely
fortunate
in
your
application
:
for
a
man
,
without
interest
or
pretension
,
may
present
a
petition
to
the
captain
-
general
of
his
majesty
's
forces
,
demanding
a
commission
for
the
first
company
that
shall
become
vacant
,
and
be
as
likely
to
meet
with
success
,
as
an
unsupported
author
that
offers
a
performance
to
the
stage
.
<EOS>
Though
a
patentee
had
no
friends
of
his
own
to
oblige
,
why
the
devil
should
he
put
himself
to
the
expence
and
trouble
attending
the
representation
of
a
new
play
,
and
part
with
three
benefit
-
nights
,
to
please
the
vanity
and
fill
the
pockets
of
a
stranger
?
"
    
<EOS>
The
northern
bard
began
to
argue
with
great
vehemence
and
vociferation
,
against
the
advice
and
observations
of
the
chairman
,
undertaking
to
prove
from
reason
,
as
well
as
from
experience
,
that
one
poet
is
of
greater
dignity
and
importance
to
the
commonwealth
,
than
all
the
patentees
or
players
that
ever
existed
.
<EOS>
But
he
was
over
-
ruled
and
silenced
in
the
beginning
of
his
harangue
,
by
a
decree
of
the
council
,
which
was
unanimously
of
opinion
,
that
the
advice
he
had
received
was
equally
judicious
and
expedient
,
and
that
it
would
be
his
own
fault
,
if
he
did
not
profit
by
the
admonition
.

CII
Further
proceedings
of
the
college
.
   
<EOS>
This
affair
was
no
sooner
discussed
,
than
another
gentleman
exhibited
a
complaint
,
signifying
,
that
he
had
undertaken
to
translate
into
English
,
a
certain
celebrated
author
,
who
had
been
cruelly
mangled
by
former
attempts
;
and
that
,
soon
as
his
design
took
air
,
the
proprietors
of
those
miserable
translations
had
endeavoured
to
prejudice
his
work
,
by
industrious
insinuations
,
contrary
to
truth
and
fair
dealing
,
importing
,
that
he
did
not
understand
one
word
of
the
language
which
he
pretended
to
translate
.
<EOS>
This
being
a
case
that
nearly
concerned
the
greatest
part
of
the
audience
,
it
was
taken
into
serious
deliberation
:
some
observed
,
that
it
was
not
only
a
malicious
effort
against
the
plaintiff
,
but
also
a
spiteful
advertisement
to
the
public
,
tending
to
promote
an
inquiry
into
the
abilities
of
all
other
translator
,
few
of
whom
(
it
was
well
known
)
were
so
qualified
,
as
to
stand
the
test
of
such
examination
.
<EOS>
Others
said
,
that
over
and
above
this
consideration
,
which
ought
to
have
its
due
weight
with
the
college
,
there
was
a
necessity
for
concerting
measures
to
humble
the
presumption
of
booksellers
,
who
had
,
from
time
immemorial
,
taken
all
opportunities
to
oppress
and
enslave
their
authors
;
not
only
by
limiting
men
of
genius
to
the
wages
of
a
journeyman
taylor
,
without
even
allowing
them
one
sabbath
in
the
week
,
but
also
in
taking
such
advantages
of
their
necessities
,
as
were
inconsistent
with
justice
and
humanity
.
    
<EOS>
"
For
example
,
(
said
one
of
the
members
)
after
I
myself
had
acquired
a
little
reputation
with
the
town
,
I
was
caressed
by
one
of
those
tyrants
who
professed
a
friendship
for
me
,
and
even
supplied
me
with
money
,
according
to
the
exigencies
of
my
situation
;
so
that
I
looked
upon
him
as
the
mirrour
of
disinterested
benevolence
;
and
had
he
known
my
disposition
,
and
treated
me
accordingly
,
I
should
have
writ
for
him
upon
his
own
terms
.
<EOS>
After
had
used
his
friendship
in
this
manner
for
some
time
,
I
happened
to
have
occasion
for
a
small
sum
of
money
,
and
with
great
confidence
made
another
application
to
my
good
friend
;
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
put
a
stop
to
his
generosity
,
refused
to
accommodate
me
in
the
most
abrupt
and
mortifying
style
;
and
though
I
was
at
that
time
pretty
far
advanced
in
a
work
for
his
benefit
,
which
was
a
sufficient
security
for
what
I
owed
him
,
he
roundly
asked
,
how
I
proposed
to
pay
the
money
which
I
had
already
borrowed
.
<EOS>
Thus
was
I
used
like
a
young
whore
just
come
upon
the
town
,
whom
the
bawd
allows
to
run
into
her
debt
,
that
she
may
have
it
in
her
power
to
oppress
her
at
pleasure
;
and
if
the
sufferer
complains
,
she
is
treated
like
the
most
ungrateful
wretch
upon
earth
;
and
that
too
with
such
appearance
of
reason
,
as
may
easily
mislead
an
unconcerned
spectator
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
You
unthankful
drab
!
<EOS>
(
she
will
say
)
did
n't
I
take
you
into
my
house
when
you
had
n't
a
shift
to
your
back
,
a
petticoat
to
your
tail
,
nor
a
morsel
of
bread
to
put
into
your
belly
?
    
<EOS>
Ha'n't
<EOS>
I
cloathed
you
from
head
to
foot
like
a
gentlewoman
,
supported
you
with
board
,
lodging
,
and
all
necessaries
,
till
your
own
extravagance
hath
brought
you
into
distress
;
and
now
you
have
the
impudence
,
you
nasty
,
stinking
brimstone
bungaway
!
<EOS>
to
say
you
are
hardly
dealt
with
,
when
I
demand
no
more
than
my
own
.
"
<EOS>
Thus
the
whore
and
the
author
are
equally
oppressed
,
and
even
left
without
the
melancholy
privilege
of
complaining
;
so
that
they
are
fain
to
subscribe
to
such
terms
as
their
creditors
shall
please
to
impose
.
    
<EOS>
This
illustration
operated
so
powerfully
upon
the
conviction
and
resentment
of
the
whole
college
,
that
revenge
was
universally
denounced
against
those
who
had
aggrieved
the
plaintiff
;
and
after
some
debate
,
it
was
agreed
,
that
he
should
make
a
new
translation
of
some
other
saleable
book
,
in
opposition
to
a
former
version
belonging
to
the
delinquents
,
and
print
it
in
such
a
small
size
,
as
would
enable
him
to
undersell
their
property
;
and
that
this
new
translation
should
be
recommended
and
introduced
into
the
world
,
with
the
whole
art
and
influence
of
the
society
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
settled
to
the
satisfaction
of
all
present
,
an
author
of
some
character
stood
up
,
and
craved
the
advice
and
assistance
of
his
fellows
,
in
punishing
a
certain
nobleman
of
great
pretensions
to
taste
,
who
,
in
consequence
of
a
production
which
this
gentleman
had
ushered
into
the
world
,
with
universal
applause
,
not
only
desired
,
but
even
eagerly
courted
his
acquaintance
.
"
<EOS>
He
invited
me
to
his
house
(
said
he
)
where
I
was
overwhelmed
with
civility
and
professions
of
friendship
.
<EOS>
He
insisted
upon
my
treating
him
as
an
intimate
,
and
calling
upon
him
at
all
hours
,
without
ceremony
;
he
made
me
promise
to
breakfast
with
him
at
least
three
times
a
week
:
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
looked
upon
myself
as
very
fortunate
,
in
meeting
with
such
advances
from
a
man
of
his
interest
and
reputation
,
who
had
it
in
his
power
to
befriend
me
effectually
in
my
passage
through
life
;
and
,
that
I
might
not
give
him
any
cause
to
think
I
neglected
his
friendship
,
I
went
to
his
house
in
two
days
,
with
a
view
of
drinking
chocolate
,
according
to
appointment
:
but
he
had
been
so
much
fatigued
with
dancing
at
an
assembly
over
night
,
that
his
valet
de
chambre
would
not
venture
to
wake
him
so
early
;
and
I
left
my
compliments
to
his
lordship
,
with
a
performance
in
manuscript
,
which
he
had
expressed
a
most
eager
desire
to
peruse
.
<EOS>
I
repeated
my
visit
next
morning
,
that
his
impatience
to
see
me
might
not
have
some
violent
effect
upon
his
constitution
;
and
received
a
message
from
his
minister
,
signifying
,
that
he
had
been
highly
entertained
with
the
manuscript
I
had
left
,
a
great
part
of
which
he
had
read
,
but
was
at
present
so
busy
in
contriving
a
proper
dress
for
a
private
masquerade
,
which
would
be
given
that
same
evening
,
that
he
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
my
company
at
breakfast
.
<EOS>
This
was
a
feasible
excuse
,
which
I
admitted
accordingly
,
and
in
a
day
or
two
appeared
again
,
when
his
lordship
was
particularly
engaged
.
<EOS>
This
might
possibly
be
the
case
;
and
therefore
I
returned
the
fourth
time
,
in
hopes
of
finding
him
more
at
leisure
;
but
he
had
gone
out
about
half
an
hour
before
my
arrival
,
and
left
my
performance
with
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
assured
me
,
that
his
lord
had
perused
it
with
infinite
pleasure
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
might
have
retired
very
well
satisfied
with
this
declaration
,
had
not
I
,
in
my
passage
through
the
hall
,
heard
one
of
the
footmen
,
upon
the
top
of
the
stair
-
case
,
pronounce
with
an
audible
voice
,
"
Will
your
lordship
please
to
be
at
home
,
when
he
calls
?
"
    
<EOS>
It
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
I
was
pleased
at
this
discovery
,
which
I
no
sooner
made
,
than
turning
to
my
conductor
,
"
I
find
,
(
said
I
)
<EOS>
his
lordship
is
disposed
to
be
abroad
to
more
people
than
me
this
morning
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
fellow
(
though
a
valet
de
chambre
)
blushed
at
this
observation
;
and
I
withdrew
,
not
a
little
irritated
at
the
silly
peer
's
disingenuity
,
and
fully
resolved
to
spare
him
my
visits
for
the
future
.
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
after
this
occasion
,
that
I
happened
to
meet
him
in
the
park
,
and
being
naturally
civil
,
I
could
not
pass
him
without
a
salutation
of
the
hat
,
which
he
returned
in
the
most
distant
manner
,
though
we
were
both
solitary
,
and
not
a
soul
within
view
;
and
when
that
very
performance
,
which
he
had
applauded
so
warmly
,
was
lately
published
by
subscription
,
he
did
not
bespeak
so
much
as
one
copy
.
<EOS>
I
have
often
reflected
with
wonder
upon
this
ridiculous
inconsistency
in
the
man
's
conduct
,
which
looks
like
the
result
of
a
settled
design
to
render
himself
odious
and
contemptible
.
<EOS>
I
never
courted
his
patronage
,
nor
indeed
thought
of
his
name
,
until
he
made
interest
for
my
acquaintance
;
and
if
he
was
disappointed
in
my
conversation
,
why
did
he
press
me
so
much
to
further
connexion
?
"
    
<EOS>
"
The
case
is
very
clear
,
(
cried
the
chairman
,
interrupting
him
)
<EOS>
he
is
one
of
those
coxcombs
who
set
up
for
taste
,
and
value
themselves
upon
knowing
all
men
of
genius
,
whom
they
would
be
thought
to
assist
in
their
productions
.
    
<EOS>
I
will
lay
an
even
bet
with
any
man
,
that
his
lordship
,
on
the
strength
of
that
slender
interview
,
together
with
the
opportunity
of
having
seen
your
performance
in
manuscript
,
has
already
hinted
to
every
company
in
which
he
is
conversant
,
that
you
solicited
his
assistance
in
retouching
the
piece
,
which
you
have
now
offered
to
the
publick
,
and
that
he
was
pleased
to
favour
you
with
his
advice
,
but
found
you
obstinately
bigotted
to
your
own
opinion
,
in
some
points
relating
to
those
very
passages
which
have
not
met
with
the
approbation
of
the
town
.
<EOS>
And
as
for
his
caresses
,
there
was
nothing
at
all
extraordinary
in
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
By
that
time
you
have
lived
to
my
age
,
you
will
not
be
surprized
to
see
a
courtier
's
promise
and
performance
of
a
different
complexion
:
not
but
that
I
would
willingly
act
as
an
auxiliary
to
your
resentment
,
if
I
thought
it
was
possible
to
make
him
repent
of
his
pitiful
dissimulation
;
but
,
if
I
guess
aright
,
the
person
you
mean
,
has
long
ago
conquered
all
sense
of
probity
and
shame
,
and
therefore
is
effectually
shielded
against
the
revenge
of
an
author
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
opinion
of
the
president
was
sanctioned
by
the
concurrence
of
all
the
members
;
and
all
other
complaints
and
memorials
being
deferred
till
another
sitting
,
the
college
proceeded
to
an
exercise
of
wit
,
which
was
generally
performed
once
every
fortnight
,
with
a
view
to
promote
the
expectoration
of
genius
.
<EOS>
The
subject
was
occasionally
chosen
by
the
chairman
,
who
opened
the
game
with
some
shrewd
remark
naturally
arising
from
the
conversation
;
and
then
the
ball
was
tossed
about
from
one
corner
of
the
room
to
the
other
,
according
to
the
motions
of
the
spirit
.
    
<EOS>
That
the
reader
may
have
a
just
idea
of
this
sport
,
and
of
the
abilities
of
those
who
carried
it
on
<EOS>
,
I
shall
repeat
the
sallies
of
this
evening
,
according
to
the
order
and
succession
in
which
they
escaped
.
    
<EOS>
One
of
the
members
observing
that
Mr
Metaphor
was
absent
,
was
told
by
the
person
who
sat
next
to
him
,
that
the
poet
had
foul
weather
at
home
,
and
could
not
stir
abroad
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
What
!
<EOS>
(
said
the
president
,
interposing
,
with
the
signal
upon
his
countenance
)
is
he
wind
-
bound
in
port
?
"
<EOS>
"
Wine
-
bound
,
I
suppose
,
"
(
cried
another
.
)
<EOS>
"
Hooped
with
wine
!
<EOS>
a
strange
metaphor
!
"
<EOS>
(
said
a
third
.
)
<EOS>
"
Not
if
he
has
got
into
a
hogshead
,
"
(
answered
a
fourth
.
)
<EOS>
"
The
hogshead
will
sooner
get
into
him
,
(
replied
a
fifth
)
<EOS>
it
must
be
a
tun
or
an
ocean
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
wonder
then
,
if
he
should
be
overwhelmed
,
"
(
said
a
sixth
.
)
<EOS>
"
If
she
should
,
(
cried
a
seventh
)
<EOS>
he
will
cast
up
when
his
gall
breaks
.
"
<EOS>
"
That
must
be
very
soon
,
(
roared
an
eighth
)
for
it
has
been
long
ready
to
burst
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
(
observed
a
ninth
)
<EOS>
he
'll
stick
fast
at
the
bottom
,
take
my
word
for
it
;
he
has
a
natural
alacrity
in
sinking
.
"
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
And
yet
,
(
remarked
a
tenth
)
<EOS>
I
have
seen
him
in
the
clouds
.
"
<EOS>
"
Then
was
he
cloudy
<EOS>
,
I
suppose
,
(
cried
the
eleventh
.
)
<EOS>
"
So
dark
,
(
replied
the
other
)
that
his
meaning
could
not
be
perceived
.
"
<EOS>
"
For
all
that
,
(
said
the
twelfth
)
<EOS>
he
is
easily
seen
through
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
talk
,
(
answered
a
thirteenth
)
as
if
his
head
was
made
of
glass
.
"
<EOS>
"
No
,
no
,
(
cried
a
fourteenth
)
<EOS>
his
head
is
made
of
more
durable
stuff
;
it
will
bend
before
it
breaks
.
"
<EOS>
"
Yet
I
have
seen
it
broken
,
"
(
resumed
the
president
.
)
<EOS>
"
Did
you
perceive
any
wit
come
out
at
the
hole
?
"
(
said
another
.
)
<EOS>
"
His
wit
(
replied
the
chairman
)
is
too
subtile
to
be
perceived
.
"
    
<EOS>
A
third
mouth
was
just
opened
,
when
the
exercise
was
suddenly
interrupted
by
the
dreadful
cry
of
fire
,
which
issued
from
the
kitchen
,
and
involved
the
whole
college
in
confusion
.
<EOS>
Every
man
endeavouring
to
be
the
first
in
making
his
exit
,
the
door
and
passage
were
blocked
up
;
each
individual
was
pummelled
by
the
person
that
happened
to
be
behind
him
.
<EOS>
This
communication
produced
noise
and
exclamation
;
clouds
of
smoke
rolled
upwards
into
the
apartment
,
and
terror
sat
on
every
brow
;
when
Peregrine
seeing
no
prospect
of
retreating
by
the
door
,
opened
one
of
the
windows
,
and
fairly
leapt
into
the
street
,
where
he
found
a
crowd
of
people
assembled
to
contribute
their
assistance
in
extinguishing
the
flames
.
<EOS>
Several
members
of
the
college
followed
his
example
,
and
happily
accomplished
their
escape
:
the
chairman
himself
being
unwilling
to
use
the
same
expedient
,
stood
trembling
on
the
brink
of
descent
,
dubious
of
his
own
agility
,
and
dreading
the
consequence
of
such
a
leap
,
when
a
chair
happening
to
pass
,
he
laid
hold
on
the
opportunity
,
and
by
an
exertion
of
his
muscles
pitched
upon
the
top
of
the
carriage
,
which
was
immediately
overturned
in
the
kennel
,
to
the
grievous
annoyance
of
the
fare
,
which
happened
to
be
a
certain
effeminate
beau
,
in
full
dress
,
on
his
way
to
a
private
assembly
.
    
<EOS>
This
phantom
of
a
man
,
hearing
the
noise
overhead
,
and
feeling
the
shock
of
being
overthrown
,
at
the
same
time
,
thought
that
some
whole
tenement
had
fallen
upon
the
chair
,
and
,
in
the
terror
of
being
crushed
to
pieces
,
uttered
a
scream
which
the
populace
supposed
to
proceed
from
the
mouth
of
a
woman
;
and
therefore
went
to
his
assistance
,
while
the
chairmen
,
instead
of
ministring
to
his
occasions
,
no
sooner
recollected
themselves
,
than
they
ran
in
pursuit
of
their
overthrower
,
who
being
accustomed
to
escapes
from
bailiffs
,
dived
into
a
dark
alley
,
and
vanishing
in
a
trice
,
was
not
visible
to
any
living
soul
,
until
he
appeared
next
day
on
Tower
-
hill
.
    
<EOS>
The
humane
part
of
the
mob
,
who
bestirred
themselves
for
the
relief
of
the
supposed
lady
,
no
sooner
perceived
their
mistake
,
in
the
appearance
of
the
beau
,
who
stared
around
him
with
horror
and
affright
,
than
their
compassion
was
changed
into
mirth
,
and
they
began
to
pass
a
great
many
unsavoury
jokes
upon
his
misfortune
,
which
they
now
discovered
no
inclination
to
alleviate
;
and
he
found
himself
very
uncomfortably
beset
,
when
Pickle
pitying
his
situation
,
interposed
in
his
behalf
,
and
prevailed
upon
the
chairmen
to
carry
him
into
the
house
of
an
apothecary
in
the
neighbourhood
,
to
whom
his
mischance
proved
a
very
advantageous
accident
;
for
the
fright
operated
so
violently
upon
his
nerves
,
that
he
was
seized
with
a
delirium
,
and
lay
a
whole
fortnight
,
deprived
of
his
senses
;
during
which
period
he
was
not
neglected
in
point
of
medicines
,
food
and
attendance
,
but
royally
regaled
,
as
appeared
by
the
contents
of
his
landlord
's
bill
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
having
seen
this
unfortunate
beau
safely
housed
,
returned
to
the
scene
of
the
other
calamity
,
which
,
as
it
was
no
other
than
a
foul
vent
,
soon
yielded
to
the
endeavours
of
the
family
,
and
was
happily
overcome
,
without
any
other
bad
consequence
than
that
of
alarming
the
neighbours
,
disturbing
the
college
,
and
disordering
the
brain
of
beau
.
    
<EOS>
Eager
to
be
acquainted
with
the
particular
constitutions
of
a
society
which
seemed
to
open
upon
him
by
degrees
,
Mr
Pickle
did
not
fail
to
appear
at
the
next
meeting
,
when
several
petitions
were
laid
before
the
board
,
in
behalf
of
those
members
who
were
confined
in
the
prisons
of
the
Fleet
,
Marshalsea
,
and
King
's
bench
.
<EOS>
As
those
unhappy
authors
expected
nothing
from
their
brethren
but
advice
and
good
offices
,
which
did
not
concern
the
purse
,
their
memorials
were
considered
with
great
care
and
humanity
;
and
,
upon
this
occasion
,
Peregrine
had
it
in
his
power
to
manifest
his
importance
to
the
community
;
for
he
happened
to
be
acquainted
with
the
creditor
of
one
of
the
prisoners
,
and
knew
that
gentleman
's
severity
was
owing
to
his
resentment
at
the
behaviour
of
the
debtor
,
who
had
lampooned
him
in
print
,
because
he
refused
to
comply
with
a
fresh
demand
,
after
he
had
lent
him
money
to
the
amount
of
a
considerable
sum
.
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
therefore
understanding
that
the
author
was
penitent
,
and
disposed
to
make
a
reasonable
submission
,
promised
to
employ
his
influence
with
the
creditor
towards
an
accommodation
;
and
,
in
a
few
days
,
actually
obtained
his
release
.
    
<EOS>
These
social
duties
being
discharged
,
the
conversation
took
a
general
turn
,
and
several
new
productions
were
freely
criticised
;
those
especially
which
belonged
to
authors
who
were
either
unconnected
with
,
or
unknown
to
the
college
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
the
profession
of
stage
-
playing
escape
the
cognizance
of
the
assembly
:
a
deputation
of
the
most
judicious
members
being
sent
weekly
to
each
theatre
,
with
a
view
of
making
remarks
upon
the
performance
of
the
actors
.
<EOS>
The
two
censors
for
the
preceding
week
were
accordingly
called
upon
to
give
in
their
report
;
and
the
plays
which
they
had
reviewed
were
the
Fair
Penitent
and
the
Revenge
.
    
<EOS>
The
person
who
had
examined
the
former
of
these
tragedies
,
owned
that
he
had
made
no
material
observations
upon
the
principal
performers
:
he
said
he
was
,
upon
the
whole
,
very
well
entertained
,
tho
'
he
had
,
at
first
,
mistaken
Lothario
,
by
his
dress
,
for
a
puppet
-
shew
man
,
hired
for
the
entertainment
of
the
guests
at
Calista
's
wedding
;
and
was
afterwards
a
little
surprised
at
his
unreasonable
demand
,
when
,
in
challenging
Horatio
to
single
combat
,
he
desired
such
an
unweildy
antagonist
to
meet
him
a
whole
mile
among
rocks
;
an
expedition
which
could
not
be
performed
without
imminent
danger
of
broken
bones
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
imagining
that
this
remark
proceeded
from
his
ignorance
of
the
play
,
observed
that
the
critick
might
possibly
be
misled
by
the
words
of
the
defiance
,
which
run
thus
:
West
of
the
town
a
mile
,
among
the
rocks
,
Two
hours
ere
noon
to
-
morrow
<EOS>
I
expect
thee
.
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
(
answered
the
censor
)
<EOS>
I
am
not
acquainted
with
the
text
,
else
I
should
have
placed
my
observation
to
the
account
of
the
author
,
instead
of
the
actor
,
who
made
a
full
stop
at
the
word
town
,
and
then
pronounced
 
a
mile
among
the
rocks
,
without
the
least
pause
of
distinction
.
    
<EOS>
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
in
the
researches
of
his
great
penetration
,
he
may
have
discovered
that
this
is
the
genuine
pointing
of
the
poet
,
and
that
Lothario
had
actually
a
design
upon
the
shins
of
Altamont
's
friend
:
in
which
case
he
is
to
be
commended
for
this
,
among
his
other
improvements
in
the
art
of
acting
;
yet
I
can
not
approve
of
his
refinements
in
the
mystery
of
dying
hard
;
his
fall
,
and
the
circumstances
of
his
death
,
in
the
character
of
this
gay
libertine
,
being
,
in
my
opinion
,
a
lively
representation
of
a
tinker
oppressed
with
gin
,
who
staggers
against
a
post
,
tumbles
into
the
kennel
,
while
his
hammer
and
saucepan
drop
from
his
hands
,
makes
divers
convulsive
efforts
to
rise
,
and
finding
himself
unable
to
get
up
,
with
many
intervening
hiccups
,
addresses
himself
to
the
surrounding
mob
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
I
confess
(
replied
Pickle
)
<EOS>
the
action
of
that
same
player
is
not
free
from
unnatural
violence
and
ridiculous
gesticulation
:
a
kind
of
false
fire
in
which
he
finds
his
account
with
the
audience
,
who
never
fail
to
honour
it
with
particular
marks
of
applause
;
but
I
think
the
simile
of
the
tinker
is
too
severe
,
and
rather
one
of
those
grotesque
comparisons
which
may
subject
the
most
grave
and
solemn
incidents
to
ridicule
,
than
a
fair
and
candid
illustration
of
the
fact
:
as
for
the
perversion
of
the
author
's
sense
,
by
an
impropriety
in
the
declamation
,
it
so
commonly
occurs
,
even
in
the
most
celebrated
actors
,
that
one
would
think
it
was
an
obstacle
not
to
be
surmounted
:
the
delightful
lullaby
of
the
stage
is
an
established
recitative
,
which
seems
to
have
been
composed
on
the
supposition
that
the
sentence
is
always
concluded
at
the
end
of
the
line
;
and
when
the
last
word
happens
to
begin
a
new
period
,
the
sense
of
the
whole
must
suffer
accordingly
.
<EOS>
I
have
heard
the
Aesopus
of
the
age
,
who
values
himself
upon
accurate
speaking
,
commit
innumerable
blunders
of
this
kind
,
one
of
which
I
,
at
present
,
recollect
,
in
a
passage
of
a
late
play
,
which
he
repeated
in
this
manner
:
To
beg
protection
for
the
men
who
lie
,
 
Trembling
behind
their
ramparts
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
he
brought
the
poor
Romans
under
the
imputation
of
falshood
as
well
as
fear
;
for
,
according
to
his
pause
,
they
told
lies
,
as
well
as
trembled
behind
their
ramparts
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
These
are
no
other
than
petty
oversights
:
(
said
the
second
censor
)
<EOS>
that
gentleman
(
take
him
all
in
all
)
is
certainly
the
most
compleat
and
unblemished
performer
that
ever
appeared
on
our
stage
,
notwithstanding
the
blind
adoration
which
is
paid
to
his
rival
.
<EOS>
I
went
two
nights
ago
,
with
an
express
design
to
criticize
his
action
:
I
could
find
no
room
for
censure
,
but
infinite
subject
for
admiration
and
applause
.
<EOS>
In
Pierre
he
is
great
,
in
Othello
excellent
,
but
in
Zanga
beyond
all
imitation
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
the
distinctness
of
pronunciation
,
the
dignity
of
attitude
and
expression
of
face
,
his
gestures
are
so
just
and
significant
,
that
a
man
,
tho
'
utterly
bereft
of
the
sense
of
hearing
,
might
,
by
seeing
him
only
,
understand
the
meaning
of
every
word
he
speaks
!
<EOS>
Sure
nothing
can
be
more
exquisite
than
his
manner
of
telling
Isabella
how
Alonzo
behaved
when
he
found
the
incendiary
letter
which
she
had
dropt
by
the
Moor
's
direction
;
and
when
,
to
crown
his
vengeance
,
he
discovers
himself
to
be
the
contriver
of
all
the
mischief
that
had
happened
,
he
manifests
a
perfect
master
piece
of
action
,
in
pronouncing
these
four
little
mono
-
syllables
,
Know
then
,
'
twas
 
<EOS>
I.
    
Peregrine
having
eyed
the
critick
some
minutes
,
"
I
fancy
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
your
praise
must
be
ironical
,
because
,
in
the
very
two
situations
you
mention
,
I
think
I
have
seen
that
player
out
-
herod
Herod
,
or
,
in
other
words
,
exceed
all
his
other
extravagances
.
    
<EOS>
The
intention
of
the
author
is
,
that
the
Moor
should
communicate
to
his
confidante
a
piece
of
information
contained
in
a
few
lines
,
which
,
doubtless
,
ought
to
be
repeated
with
an
air
of
eagerness
and
satisfaction
,
not
with
the
ridiculous
grimace
of
a
monkey
,
to
which
,
methought
,
his
action
bore
an
intimate
resemblance
,
in
uttering
this
plain
sentence
:
  
he
took
it
up
;
But
scarce
was
it
unfolded
to
his
sight
,
When
he
,
as
if
an
arrow
pierc'd
his
eye
,
Started
,
and
trembling
dropt
it
on
the
ground
.
    
<EOS>
In
pronouncing
the
first
two
words
,
this
egregious
actor
stoops
down
,
and
seems
to
take
up
something
from
the
stage
,
then
proceeding
to
repeat
what
follows
,
mimicks
the
manner
of
unfolding
a
letter
;
when
he
mentions
the
simile
of
an
arrow
piercing
the
eye
,
he
darts
his
forefinger
towards
that
organ
,
then
recoils
with
great
violence
when
the
word
started
is
expressed
;
and
when
he
comes
to
trembling
dropt
it
on
the
ground
,
he
throws
all
his
limbs
into
a
tremulous
motion
,
and
shakes
the
imaginary
paper
from
his
hand
.
<EOS>
The
latter
part
of
the
description
is
carried
on
with
the
same
minute
gesticulation
,
while
he
says
,
Pale
and
aghast
a
while
my
victim
stood
,
Disguised
a
sigh
or
two
,
and
puff'd
them
from
him
;
Then
rubb'd
<EOS>
his
brow
,
and
took
it
up
again
.
    
<EOS>
The
player
's
countenance
assumes
a
wild
stare
,
he
sighs
twice
most
piteously
,
as
if
he
were
on
the
point
of
suffocation
,
scrubs
his
forehead
,
and
bending
his
body
,
apes
the
action
of
snatching
an
object
from
the
floor
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
this
dexterity
of
dumb
shew
omitted
,
when
he
concludes
his
intimation
in
these
three
lines
:
    
<EOS>
At
first
,
he
look'd
<EOS>
as
if
he
meant
to
read
it
;
But
,
check'd
by
rising
fears
,
he
crush'd
it
thus
,
And
thrust
it
,
like
an
adder
,
in
his
bosom
.
    
<EOS>
Here
the
judicious
performer
imitates
the
confusion
and
concern
of
Alonzo
,
seems
to
cast
his
eyes
upon
something
,
from
which
they
are
immediately
withdrawn
,
with
horror
and
precipitation
,
then
shutting
his
fist
with
a
violent
squeeze
,
as
if
he
intended
to
make
immediate
application
to
Isabella
's
nose
,
he
rams
it
in
his
own
bosom
,
with
all
the
horror
and
agitation
of
a
thief
taken
in
the
manner
.
<EOS>
Were
the
player
debarred
the
use
of
speech
,
and
obliged
to
act
to
the
eyes
only
of
the
audience
,
this
mimickry
might
be
a
necessary
conveyance
of
his
meaning
;
but
when
he
is
at
liberty
to
signify
his
ideas
by
language
,
nothing
can
be
more
trivial
,
forced
,
unnatural
and
antick
,
than
this
superfluous
mummery
.
<EOS>
Not
that
I
would
exclude
from
the
representation
the
graces
of
action
,
without
which
the
choicest
sentiments
,
cloathed
in
the
most
exquisite
expression
,
would
appear
unanimated
and
insipid
;
but
these
are
as
different
from
this
ridiculous
burlesque
,
as
is
the
demeanor
of
a
Tully
in
the
rostrum
,
from
the
tricks
of
a
Jack
-
pudding
on
a
mountebank
's
stage
and
for
the
truth
of
what
I
alledge
,
I
appeal
to
the
observation
of
any
person
who
has
considered
the
elegance
of
attitude
and
propriety
of
gesture
,
as
they
are
universally
acknowledged
in
the
real
characters
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
I
have
known
as
Gascon
,
whose
limbs
were
as
eloquent
as
his
tongue
he
never
mentioned
the
word
sleep
without
reclining
his
head
upon
his
hand
;
when
he
had
occasion
to
talk
of
an
horse
,
he
always
started
up
and
trotted
across
the
room
,
except
when
he
was
so
situated
that
he
could
not
stir
without
incommoding
the
company
,
and
in
that
case
he
contented
himself
with
neighing
aloud
:
if
a
dog
happened
to
be
the
subject
of
his
conversation
,
he
wagged
his
tail
,
and
grinned
in
a
most
significant
manner
;
and
one
day
he
expressed
his
desire
of
going
backwards
with
such
natural
imitation
of
his
purpose
,
that
every
body
in
the
room
firmly
believed
he
had
actually
overshot
himself
,
and
fortified
their
nostrils
accordingly
.
<EOS>
Yet
no
man
ever
looked
upon
this
virtuoso
to
be
the
standard
of
propriety
in
point
of
speaking
and
deportment
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
confess
the
player
in
question
<EOS>
would
,
by
dint
of
these
qualifications
,
make
a
very
good
figure
in
the
character
of
Pantaloon
's
lacquey
,
in
the
entertainment
of
Perseus
and
Andromeda
,
and
perhaps
might
acquire
some
reputation
,
by
turning
the
Revenge
into
a
pantomime
;
in
which
cause
,
I
would
advise
him
to
come
upon
the
stage
,
provided
with
an
handful
of
flour
,
in
order
to
besmear
his
face
,
when
he
pronounces
pale
and
aghast
,
&
c.
and
methinks
<EOS>
he
ought
to
illustrate
the
adder
with
an
hideous
hiss
.
<EOS>
But
let
us
now
come
to
the
other
situation
,
in
which
this
modern
Aesopus
is
supposed
to
distinguish
himself
so
much
,
I
mean
that
same
eclaircissement
comprehended
in
Know
<EOS>
then
'
twas
 
I.
    
<EOS>
His
manner
,
I
own
,
may
be
altered
since
I
was
present
at
the
representation
of
that
performance
;
but
certain
I
am
,
when
I
beheld
him
in
that
critical
conjuncture
,
his
behaviour
appeared
to
me
so
uncouth
,
<EOS>
that
I
really
imagined
he
was
visited
by
some
epileptic
distemper
;
for
he
stood
tottering
and
gasping
for
the
space
of
two
minutes
,
like
a
man
suddenly
struck
with
the
palsy
;
and
after
various
distorsions
and
side
-
shakings
,
as
if
he
had
got
fleas
in
his
doublet
,
heaved
up
from
his
lungs
the
letter
<EOS>
I
,
like
a
huge
anchor
from
foul
ground
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
criticism
was
acceptable
to
the
majority
of
the
college
,
who
had
no
great
veneration
for
the
player
in
question
;
and
his
admirer
,
without
making
any
reply
,
asked
in
a
whisper
,
of
the
gentleman
who
sat
next
to
him
,
if
Pickle
had
not
offered
some
production
to
the
stage
,
and
met
with
a
repulse
.
<EOS>
This
question
was
not
conveyed
so
softly
,
but
that
it
reached
the
ears
of
our
adventurer
,
who
seemed
disposed
to
make
some
answer
,
when
he
was
prevented
by
the
interposition
of
another
member
,
who
begged
the
opinion
and
advice
of
the
community
,
touching
a
pastoral
which
he
had
just
composed
.
<EOS>
Before
he
had
time
to
produce
the
performance
to
the
inspection
of
the
society
,
the
chairman
observed
,
with
a
splenetic
air
,
that
he
ought
to
have
employed
his
time
in
some
more
profitable
amusement
,
than
a
species
of
writing
in
which
he
had
formerly
met
with
so
little
success
.
    
<EOS>
"
True
it
is
(
replied
the
author
)
<EOS>
my
last
production
of
this
kind
was
not
very
favourably
received
;
a
circumstance
intirely
owing
to
the
nature
of
the
subject
,
which
did
not
at
all
interest
the
passions
of
the
heart
:
but
here
,
my
dear
Sir
,
the
case
is
otherwise
;
this
pastoral
I
composed
upon
the
death
of
my
own
grandmother
,
who
was
a
woman
,
in
all
respects
,
worthy
of
the
tears
I
have
shed
over
her
tomb
;
and
this
small
composition
is
the
genuine
offspring
of
unfeigned
sorrow
:
the
blots
which
are
still
visible
on
the
paper
,
indicate
the
grief
with
which
I
wrote
it
.
<EOS>
Lachrymae
fecre
lituras
.
    
<EOS>
And
sure
he
must
have
a
flinty
heart
who
can
hear
it
read
with
an
unmoistened
eye
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
If
that
be
the
case
(
said
the
president
)
<EOS>
I
wish
you
would
spare
us
the
affliction
of
hearing
it
rehears'd
:
all
of
us
,
I
believe
,
have
real
grievances
of
our
own
;
so
that
we
need
not
hunt
after
imaginary
sorrows
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
poet
,
notwithstanding
this
discouragement
,
begg'd
hard
that
he
might
exhibit
a
specimen
of
his
performance
;
and
being
restricted
to
a
few
lines
,
he
repeated
the
following
stanzas
,
with
the
most
rueful
emphasis
.
    
<EOS>
Where
wast
thou

,
when
hapless

From

weak
arms
mine

<EOS>
These
pious

<EOS>
too

,
To

<EOS>
Could

illustrious

<EOS>
Could

For

Thy

Nor

<EOS>
Ill

That

When

And

the

<EOS>
Her

The

The

Did

The

daily

And
turky
with
his

so
red
;
Of

careful
as
the
pious

Nor
did
she
overlook
the

<EOS>
While

hopp'd
before

in

,
As
if

<EOS>
For
my
distracted
mind
,
What
comfort
can
I
find
?
<EOS>
O
best
of
grannams
!
<EOS>
thou
art
dead
and
gone
,
<EOS>
And
I
am
left
behind
to
weep
and
moan
,
<EOS>
To
sing
thy
dirge
in
sad
funereal
lay
,
Ah

<EOS>
woe

<EOS>
alack

<EOS>
and

<EOS>
These
interjections
at
the
close
of
this
pathetic
elegy
,
were
not
pronounced
without
the
sobs
and
tears
of
the
author
,
who
looked
wishfully
around
him
for
applause
,
and
having
wiped
his
eyes
,
asked
the
chairman
's
opinion
of
what
he
had
read
.
<EOS>
That
cynical
gentleman
,
who
had
no
great
devotion
for
the
Arcadian
,
answered
with
a
most
equivocal
aspect
,
"
Sad
,
very
sad
!
<EOS>
sad
enough
to
draw
tears
from
the
eyes
of
a
bumbailiff
.
<EOS>
"
But
as
the
performance
was
submitted
to
the
criticism
of
the
whole
society
,
the
epic
poet
stood
up
,
and
thus
communicated
his
sentiments
.
    
<EOS>
"
Without
entering
upon
a
minute
inquiry
into
the
poetical
merits
of
particular
images
,
I
must
in
general
observe
,
that
the
stanzas
are
so
irregular
in
point
of
measure
,
as
well
as
in
the
number
of
the
lines
,
that
they
can
not
be
comprehended
under
any
species
of
the
ancient
versification
.
<EOS>
Then
there
are
many
dark
allusions
in
the
Antistrophe
,
which
no
reader
can
possibly
understand
,
together
with
a
catalogue
of
the
names
of
places
,
for
which
the
author
seems
to
have
rambled
strangely
from
his
subject
,
more
studious
of
making
a
silly
parade
of
his
skill
in
poetical
geography
,
than
of
interesting
the
passions
of
the
heart
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
one
would
be
apt
to
conclude
from
this
circumstance
,
that
his
grief
was
mere
affectation
,
did
not
he
blubber
<EOS>
so
piteously
in
the
last
verse
.
<EOS>
I
could
have
wished
,
that
more
dignity
had
been
preserved
in
the
stanza
which
describes
the
old
gentlewoman
's
benevolence
,
and
that
the
last
line
had
been
altogether
omitted
,
because
it
conjures
up
a
most
ridiculous
image
of
her
having
actually
hatched
that
same
poultry
,
which
she
is
said
to
have
tended
with
such
maternal
care
.
"
    
<EOS>
To
these
animadversions
the
censured
bard
replied
,
that
the
verse
,
in
being
irregular
,
the
more
nearly
resembled
the
natural
exclamations
of
real
affliction
,
and
that
such
irregularity
had
not
only
been
excused
,
but
even
considered
as
a
beauty
in
many
modern
productions
.
<EOS>
He
owned
,
that
the
allusions
might
be
obscure
to
some
readers
,
and
therefore
he
intended
to
explain
them
in
notes
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
.
<EOS>
As
to
the
topical
descriptions
which
the
critic
had
censured
so
severely
,
he
said
they
were
inserted
to
amuse
and
relieve
the
imagination
of
the
reader
,
that
he
might
not
be
too
much
affected
with
the
Pathos
of
the
subject
;
and
with
regard
to
the
line
,
    
<EOS>
As
if
she
common
mother
were
of
all
,
    
far
from
carrying
that
ludicrous
implication
he
had
mentioned
,
it
certainly
conveyed
the
most
amiable
and
parental
idea
of
the
deceased
;
and
he
did
not
doubt
,
that
he
should
find
his
own
opinion
confirmed
by
that
of
the
public
,
in
a
very
comfortable
sale
of
the
work
.
    
<EOS>
"
So
,
after
all
this
profession
of
filial
tenderness
,
(
cried
the
epic
bard
)
<EOS>
the
world
will
have
some
reason
to
say
,
you
wanted
to
make
a
job
of
your
grandmother
's
death
.
"
<EOS>
"
Perhaps
(
answered
the
other
)
<EOS>
I
shall
make
a
present
of
the
copy
to
my
bookseller
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
you
desire
to
be
thought
altogether
disinterested
in
the
affair
,
(
resumed
the
critic
)
<EOS>
you
ought
to
print
a
few
copies
at
your
own
expence
,
and
distribute
them
gratis
among
your
friends
;
by
these
means
,
you
will
have
as
good
a
chance
to
see
your
own
talents
admired
,
and
the
memory
of
your
grandame
immortalized
,
as
if
you
had
sold
the
property
of
the
piece
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
proposal
seemed
to
disconcert
the
elegiac
writer
;
when
the
chairman
interposing
,
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
why
the
devil
should
he
be
more
delicate
in
that
respect
,
than
those
people
who
sit
at
the
head
of
taste
?
<EOS>
In
every
single
circumstance
to
which
you
have
objected
,
he
has
expressly
imitated
,
not
to
say
copied
,
the
celebrated
production
of
the
universal
patron
.
"
<EOS>
"
What
!
<EOS>
(
replied
the
other
)
<EOS>
you
mean
the
famous
Gosling
Scrag
Esq
;
son
and
heir
of
Sir
Marmaduke
Scrag
,
who
seats
himself
in
the
chair
of
judgment
,
and
gives
sentence
upon
the
authors
of
the
age
.
    
<EOS>
I
should
be
glad
to
know
,
upon
what
pretensions
to
genius
<EOS>
this
preheminence
is
founded
.
<EOS>
Do
a
few
flimsy
odes
,
barren
epistles
,
pointless
epigrams
,
and
the
superstitious
suggestions
of
an
half
-
witted
enthusiast
,
intitle
him
to
that
eminent
rank
he
maintains
in
the
world
of
letters
?
<EOS>
or
did
he
acquire
the
reputation
of
a
wit
,
by
a
repetition
of
trite
invectives
against
a
minister
,
conveyed
in
a
theatrical
cadence
,
accompanied
with
the
most
ridiculous
gestures
,
before
he
believed
it
was
his
interest
to
desert
his
master
,
and
renounce
his
party
?
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
never
perused
any
of
his
performances
,
I
never
saw
him
open
his
mouth
in
public
<EOS>
,
I
never
heard
him
speak
in
private
conversation
,
without
recollecting
and
applying
these
two
lines
in
Pope
's
Dunciad
,
Dulness
delighted
,
ey'd
the
lively
dunce
,
Remembring
she
herself
was
pertness
once
.
    
<EOS>
Yet
this
antick
piece
of
futility
will
decide
dogmatically
upon
the
merits
of
every
new
work
;
and
if
the
author
has
not
previously
scratched
himself
into
his
favour
,
will
pronounce
upon
it
,
with
all
the
insolence
and
contempt
of
supercilious
presumption
.
<EOS>
Nor
is
the
levity
of
his
head
less
provoking
than
his
arrogance
and
self
-
conceit
;
the
very
performance
which
he
yesterday
applauded
,
will
he
to
-
morrow
condemn
through
mere
caprice
;
and
that
which
he
yesterday
mentioned
in
terms
of
disdain
,
will
he
to
-
morrow
extol
to
the
skies
,
provided
the
author
will
humble
himself
so
far
,
as
to
adore
his
superior
genius
,
and
meanly
beg
his
protection
.
    
<EOS>
Never
did
he
befriend
a
man
of
poetical
merit
,
who
did
not
court
and
retain
his
favour
by
such
slavish
prostitution
,
except
one
author
,
lately
deceased
;
and
even
he
extended
his
complaisance
too
far
,
in
complimental
lines
,
which
the
warmth
of
his
gratitude
inspired
,
though
he
would
never
submit
to
the
tame
criticisms
of
his
patron
,
or
offer
such
an
outrage
to
his
own
judgment
,
as
to
adopt
the
alterations
which
he
proposed
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
One
would
imagine
,
(
said
the
chairman
)
that
you
had
made
an
unsuccessful
application
to
his
patronage
;
but
,
notwithstanding
all
this
eloquent
declamation
,
the
truth
of
which
I
shall
not
pretend
to
invalidate
,
I
do
aver
,
that
Gosling
Scrag
Esq
;
is
at
this
day
the
best
milch
-
cow
that
any
author
ever
stroaked
:
for
,
over
and
above
his
vanity
,
which
lays
him
open
to
the
necessities
of
all
writers
who
can
tickle
,
<EOS>
though
never
so
awkwardly
,
he
possesses
such
a
comfortable
share
of
simplicity
,
or
rather
lack
of
penetration
,
as
can
not
fail
to
turn
to
account
with
those
who
practise
upon
it
.
    
<EOS>
Let
a
scribbler
(
for
example
)
creep
into
his
notice
by
the
most
abject
veneration
,
implore
his
judgment
upon
some
performance
,
assume
a
look
of
awful
admiration
at
his
remarks
,
receive
and
read
his
emendations
with
pretended
extasy
,
exert
himself
officiously
about
his
person
,
make
interest
to
be
employed
in
running
upon
his
errands
,
bawl
for
him
upon
all
occasions
in
common
conversation
,
prose
and
rhime
,
sit
in
presence
of
this
great
man
,
with
an
apparent
sense
of
his
own
nothingness
,
and
when
he
opens
his
mouth
,
listen
with
a
foolish
face
of
praise
;
happy
!
<EOS>
if
he
has
an
opportunity
to
feed
him
with
the
soft
pap
of
dedication
,
or
by
affecting
an
idiotical
ignorance
of
the
manners
of
life
,
to
insinuate
himself
into
his
opinion
,
as
a
person
absolutely
detached
from
all
worldly
pursuits
;
like
a
sly
brother
of
the
quill
,
who
,
in
going
out
,
dropped
a
bank
note
upon
the
floor
of
his
apartment
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
that
it
could
not
escape
the
notice
of
Gosling
,
who
viewing
it
accordingly
,
"
Heavens
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
,
with
his
hands
and
eyes
lifted
up
)
<EOS>
what
philosophical
contempt
must
that
man
have
for
the
pleasures
of
wealth
!
"
<EOS>
Yes
,
I
insist
upon
it
,
these
are
arts
which
will
never
fail
to
engage
the
friendship
of
Mr
Scrag
,
which
will
be
sooner
or
later
manifested
in
some
warm
sine
-
cure
,
ample
subscription
,
post
or
reversion
;
and
I
advise
Mr
Spondy
to
give
him
the
refusal
of
this
same
pastoral
:
who
knows
but
he
may
have
the
good
fortune
of
being
listed
in
the
number
of
his
beef
-
eaters
;
in
which
case
he
may
,
in
process
of
time
,
be
provided
for
in
the
customs
or
church
;
when
he
is
inclined
to
marry
his
own
cook
-
wench
,
his
gracious
patron
may
condescend
to
give
the
bride
away
;
and
finally
settle
him
in
his
old
age
,
as
a
trading
Westminster
-
justice
.
"
    
<EOS>
Mr
Spondy
thanked
the
president
for
his
wholesome
counsel
,
which
he
assured
him
should
not
be
neglected
;
and
the
evening
being
far
advanced
,
the
assembly
broke
up
,
without
any
other
remarkable
occurrence

Chapter
CIII
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
is
introduced
to
a
virtuoso
of
the
first
order
,
and
commences
Yelper
.
   
<EOS>
Hitherto
Peregrine
had
professed
himself
an
author
,
without
reaping
the
fruits
of
that
occupation
,
except
the
little
fame
he
had
acquired
by
his
late
satire
;
but
now
he
thought
it
high
time
to
weigh
solid
pudding
against
empty
praise
;
and
therefore
engaged
with
some
booksellers
in
a
certain
translation
,
which
he
obliged
himself
to
perform
for
the
consideration
of
two
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
articles
of
agreement
being
drawn
,
he
began
his
task
with
great
eagerness
,
rose
early
in
the
morning
to
his
work
,
at
which
he
laboured
all
day
long
,
went
abroad
with
the
bats
in
the
evening
,
and
appeared
in
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
amused
himself
with
the
news
-
papers
and
conversation
till
nine
o'clock
;
then
he
retired
to
his
own
apartment
,
and
after
a
slight
repast
,
betook
himself
to
rest
,
that
he
might
be
able
to
unroost
with
the
cock
.
<EOS>
This
sudden
change
from
his
former
way
of
life
agreed
so
ill
with
his
disposition
,
that
,
for
the
first
time
,
he
was
troubled
with
flatulencies
and
indigestion
,
which
produced
anxiety
and
dejection
of
spirits
,
and
the
nature
of
his
situation
began
in
some
measure
to
discompose
his
brain
;
a
discovery
which
he
no
sooner
made
,
than
he
had
recourse
to
the
advice
of
a
young
physician
,
who
was
a
member
of
the
college
,
and
at
this
time
one
of
our
hero
's
most
intimate
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
This
son
of
Aesculapius
having
considered
his
case
,
imputed
his
disorder
to
the
right
cause
,
namely
,
want
of
exercise
;
dissuaded
him
from
such
close
application
to
study
,
until
he
should
be
gradually
familiarized
to
a
sedentary
life
,
advised
him
to
enjoy
his
friend
and
his
bottle
in
moderation
,
and
wean
himself
from
his
former
customs
by
degrees
;
and
,
above
all
things
,
to
rise
immediately
after
his
first
sleep
,
and
exercise
himself
in
a
morning
-
walk
.
    
<EOS>
In
order
to
render
this
last
part
of
the
prescription
the
more
palatable
,
the
doctor
promised
to
attend
him
in
these
early
excursions
,
and
even
to
introduce
him
to
a
certain
personage
of
note
,
who
gave
a
sort
of
public
breakfasting
to
the
minor
virtuosi
of
the
age
,
and
often
employed
his
interest
in
behalf
of
those
who
properly
cultivated
his
countenance
and
approbation
.
    
<EOS>
This
proposal
was
extremely
acceptable
to
our
young
gentleman
,
who
,
besides
the
advantage
which
might
accrue
to
him
from
such
a
valuable
connexion
,
foresaw
much
entertainment
and
satisfaction
in
the
discourse
of
so
many
learned
guests
.
<EOS>
The
occasions
of
his
health
and
interest
,
moreover
,
coincided
in
another
circumstance
,
the
minister
's
levee
being
kept
betimes
in
the
morning
;
so
that
he
could
perform
his
walk
,
yield
his
attendance
,
and
breakfast
at
this
philosophical
board
,
without
incroaching
a
great
deal
upon
his
other
avocations
.
    
<EOS>
Measures
being
thus
preconcerted
,
the
physician
conducted
our
adventurer
to
the
house
of
this
celebrated
sage
,
to
whom
he
recommended
him
as
a
gentleman
of
genius
and
taste
,
who
craved
the
honour
of
his
acquaintance
;
but
he
had
previously
smoothed
the
way
to
this
introduction
,
by
representing
Peregrine
as
a
young
fellow
of
great
ambition
,
spirit
and
address
,
who
could
not
fail
to
make
a
figure
in
the
world
;
that
,
therefore
,
he
would
be
a
creditable
addition
to
the
subordinates
of
such
a
patron
,
and
by
his
qualifications
,
intrepidity
and
warmth
of
temper
,
turn
out
a
consummate
herald
of
his
fame
.
<EOS>
Upon
these
considerations
,
he
met
with
a
most
engaging
reception
from
the
entertainer
,
who
was
a
well
-
bred
man
,
of
some
learning
,
generosity
and
taste
;
but
his
foible
was
the
desire
of
being
thought
the
inimitable
pattern
of
all
three
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
with
a
view
to
acquire
and
support
this
character
,
that
his
house
was
open
to
all
those
who
had
any
pretensions
to
literature
;
consequently
he
was
surrounded
by
a
strange
variety
of
pretenders
;
but
none
were
discouraged
,
because
he
knew
that
even
the
most
insignificant
might
,
in
some
shape
,
conduce
to
the
propagation
of
his
praise
.
<EOS>
A
babbler
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
can
not
run
upon
the
scent
,
may
spring
the
game
,
and
by
his
yelping
help
to
fill
up
the
cry
:
<EOS>
no
wonder
then
,
that
a
youth
of
Pickle
's
accomplishments
was
admitted
and
even
invited
into
the
pack
.
<EOS>
After
having
enjoyed
a
very
short
private
audience
in
the
closet
,
our
young
gentleman
was
shewn
into
another
room
,
where
half
a
dozen
of
his
fellow
-
adherents
waited
for
their
Maecenas
,
who
in
a
few
minutes
appeared
,
with
a
most
gracious
aspect
,
received
the
compliments
of
the
morning
,
and
sat
down
to
breakfast
,
in
the
midst
of
them
,
without
any
further
ceremony
.
    
<EOS>
The
conversation
at
first
turned
upon
the
weather
,
which
was
investigated
in
a
very
philosophical
manner
by
one
of
the
company
,
who
seemed
to
have
consulted
all
the
barometers
and
thermometers
that
ever
were
invented
,
before
he
would
venture
to
affirm
that
it
was
a
chill
morning
.
<EOS>
This
subject
being
accurately
discussed
,
the
chief
inquired
about
the
news
of
the
learned
world
;
and
his
inclination
was
no
sooner
expressed
than
every
guest
opened
his
mouth
,
in
order
to
gratify
his
curiosity
:
but
he
that
first
captivated
his
attention
was
a
meager
,
shrivelled
antiquary
,
who
looked
like
an
animated
mummy
,
which
had
been
scorched
among
the
sands
of
the
desert
.
    
<EOS>
He
told
the
patron
,
that
he
had
by
accident
met
with
a
medal
,
which
,
tho
'
it
was
defaced
by
time
,
he
would
venture
to
pronounce
a
genuine
antique
,
from
the
ringing
and
taste
of
the
metal
,
as
well
as
from
the
colour
and
composition
of
the
rust
:
<EOS>
so
saying
,
he
produced
a
piece
of
copper
coin
,
so
consumed
and
disguised
by
age
,
that
scarce
a
vestige
of
the
impression
was
to
be
perceived
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
this
connoisseur
pretended
to
distinguish
a
face
in
profil
,
from
which
he
concluded
that
the
piece
was
of
the
Upper
empire
,
and
on
the
reverse
he
endeavoured
to
point
out
the
bulb
of
the
spear
,
and
part
of
the
parazonium
,
which
were
the
insignia
of
the
Roman
Virtus
,
together
with
the
fragment
of
one
fold
of
the
multicium
in
which
she
was
cloathed
.
<EOS>
He
likewise
had
discovered
one
angle
of
the
letter
N
,
and
,
at
some
distance
,
an
intire
<EOS>
I
:
from
these
circumstances
conjecturing
,
and
indeed
concluding
,
that
the
medal
was
struck
by
Severus
,
in
honour
of
the
victory
he
obtained
over
his
rival
Niger
,
after
he
had
forced
the
passes
of
mount
Taurus
.
<EOS>
This
criticism
seemed
very
satisfactory
to
the
entertainer
,
who
having
examined
the
coin
by
the
help
of
his
spectacles
,
plainly
discerned
the
particulars
which
the
owner
had
mentioned
,
and
was
pleased
to
term
his
account
of
the
matter
a
very
ingenious
explanation
.
    
<EOS>
The
curiosity
was
circulated
through
the
hands
of
all
present
,
and
every
virtuoso
,
in
his
turn
,
licked
the
copper
,
and
rung
it
upon
the
hearth
,
declaring
his
assent
to
the
judgment
which
had
been
pronounced
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
,
it
fell
under
the
inspection
of
our
young
gentleman
,
who
,
tho
'
no
antiquarian
,
was
very
well
acquainted
with
the
current
coin
of
his
own
country
,
and
no
sooner
cast
his
eyes
upon
this
valuable
antique
,
than
he
affirmed
,
without
hesitation
,
that
it
was
no
other
than
the
ruins
of
an
English
farthing
,
and
that
same
spear
,
parazonium
,
and
multicium
,
the
remains
of
the
emblems
and
drapery
with
which
the
figure
of
Britannia
is
delineated
on
our
copper
-
money
.
    
<EOS>
This
hardy
asseveration
seemed
to
disconcert
the
patron
,
while
it
incensed
the
medallist
,
who
grinning
like
an
enraged
baboon
,
"
What
d'ye
tell
me
of
a
brass
farthing
?
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
Did
you
ever
know
modern
brass
of
such
a
relish
?
<EOS>
Do
but
taste
it
,
young
gentleman
;
and
sure
I
am
,
if
you
have
ever
been
conversant
with
subjects
of
this
kind
,
you
will
find
as
wide
a
difference
in
the
favour
between
this
and
an
English
farthing
,
as
can
possibly
be
perceived
betwixt
an
onion
and
a
turnip
:
<EOS>
besides
,
this
medal
has
the
true
Corinthian
ring
;
then
the
attitude
is
upright
,
whereas
that
of
Britannia
is
reclining
;
and
how
is
it
possible
to
mistake
a
branch
of
palm
for
a
parazonium
?
"
    
<EOS>
All
the
rest
of
the
company
espoused
the
virtuoso
's
side
of
the
question
,
because
the
reputation
of
each
was
concerned
;
and
the
patron
finding
himself
in
the
same
predicament
,
assumed
a
solemnity
of
feature
,
dashed
with
a
small
mixture
of
displeasure
,
and
told
Peregrine
,
that
as
he
had
not
made
that
branch
of
literature
his
particular
study
,
he
was
not
surprised
to
see
him
mistaken
in
his
opinion
.
<EOS>
Pickle
immediately
understood
the
reproof
;
and
tho
'
<EOS>
he
was
shocked
at
the
vanity
or
infatuation
of
his
entertainer
and
fellow
-
guests
,
asked
pardon
for
his
presumption
,
which
was
accordingly
excused
,
in
consideration
of
his
inexperience
;
and
the
English
farthing
dignified
with
the
title
of
a
true
antique
.
    
<EOS>
The
next
person
that
addressed
himself
to
the
chief
was
a
gentleman
of
a
very
mathematical
turn
,
who
valued
himself
upon
the
improvements
he
had
made
in
several
domestic
machines
,
and
now
presented
the
plan
of
a
new
contrivance
for
cutting
cabbages
,
in
such
a
manner
as
would
secure
the
stock
against
the
rotting
rain
,
and
enable
it
to
produce
a
plenteous
after
-
crop
of
delicious
sprouts
.
<EOS>
In
this
important
machine
he
had
united
the
whole
mechanic
powers
,
with
such
massy
complication
of
iron
and
wood
,
that
it
could
not
have
been
moved
without
the
assistance
of
an
horse
,
and
a
road
made
for
the
convenience
of
the
draught
.
<EOS>
These
objections
were
so
obvious
,
that
they
occurred
at
first
sight
to
the
inspector
-
general
,
who
greatly
commended
the
invention
,
which
,
he
observed
,
might
be
applied
to
several
other
useful
purposes
,
could
it
once
be
rendered
a
little
more
portable
and
commodious
.
    
<EOS>
The
inventor
,
who
had
not
foreseen
these
difficulties
,
was
not
prepared
to
surmount
them
;
but
he
took
the
hint
in
good
part
,
and
promised
to
task
his
abilities
anew
,
in
altering
the
constitution
of
his
design
.
    
<EOS>
Not
but
that
he
underwent
some
severe
irony
from
the
rest
of
the
virtuosi
,
who
complimented
him
upon
the
momentous
improvement
he
had
made
,
by
which
a
family
might
save
a
dish
of
greens
in
a
quarter
,
for
so
trifling
an
expence
as
that
of
purchasing
,
working
and
maintaining
such
a
stupendous
machine
:
<EOS>
but
no
man
was
more
sarcastic
in
his
remarks
upon
this
piece
of
mechanism
than
the
naturalist
,
who
next
appealed
to
the
patron
's
approbation
for
a
curious
disquisition
he
had
made
,
touching
the
procreation
of
muck
flies
,
in
which
he
had
laid
down
a
curious
method
of
collecting
,
preserving
and
hatching
the
eggs
of
these
insects
,
even
in
the
winter
,
by
certain
modifications
of
artificial
heat
.
<EOS>
The
nature
of
this
discovery
was
no
sooner
communicated
,
than
Peregrine
,
unable
to
contain
himself
,
burst
into
a
fit
of
laughter
,
which
infected
every
person
at
the
table
,
the
landlord
himself
not
excepted
,
who
found
it
impossible
to
preserve
his
wonted
gravity
of
face
.
    
<EOS>
Such
unmannerly
mirth
did
not
fail
to
mortify
the
philosopher
,
who
,
after
some
pause
,
during
which
indignation
and
disdain
were
painted
in
his
countenance
,
reprehended
our
young
gentleman
for
his
unphilosophical
behaviour
,
and
undertook
to
prove
,
that
the
subject
of
his
inquiry
was
of
infinite
consequence
to
the
progress
and
increase
of
natural
knowledge
:
but
he
found
no
quarter
from
the
vengeful
engineer
,
who
now
retorted
his
ironical
compliments
,
with
great
emphasis
,
upon
this
hot
-
bed
for
the
generation
of
vermin
,
and
advised
him
to
lay
the
whole
process
before
the
Royal
Society
,
which
would
,
doubtless
,
present
him
with
a
medal
,
and
give
him
a
place
among
their
memoirs
,
as
a
distinguished
promoter
of
the
useful
arts
.
<EOS>
If
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
you
had
employed
your
studies
in
finding
out
some
effectual
method
to
destroy
those
insects
which
prejudice
and
annoy
mankind
,
<EOS>
in
all
probability
you
must
have
been
contented
with
the
contemplation
of
the
good
you
had
done
;
but
this
curious
expedient
for
multiplying
maggots
,
will
surely
intitle
you
to
an
honourable
rank
in
the
list
of
learned
philosophers
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
do
n't
wonder
(
replied
the
naturalist
)
that
you
should
be
so
much
adverse
to
the
propagation
of
insects
,
because
,
in
all
likelihood
,
you
are
afraid
that
they
will
not
leave
you
a
cabbage
to
cut
down
with
that
same
miraculous
machine
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
(
answered
the
mechanic
,
with
great
bitterness
of
voice
and
aspect
)
<EOS>
if
the
cabbage
be
as
light
-
headed
as
some
muck
-
worm
philosophers
,
it
will
not
be
worth
cutting
down
.
"
<EOS>
"
I
never
dispute
upon
cabbage
with
the
son
of
a
cucumber
,
"
said
the
fly
-
breeder
,
alluding
to
the
pedigree
of
his
antagonist
;
who
,
impatient
of
the
affront
,
started
up
with
fury
in
his
looks
,
exclaiming
,
"
'
Sdeath
!
<EOS>
meaning
me
,
Sir
?
"
    
<EOS>
Here
the
patron
,
perceiving
things
drawing
towards
a
rupture
,
interposed
his
authority
,
rebuking
them
for
their
intemperance
,
and
recommending
to
them
amity
and
concord
against
the
Goths
and
Vandals
of
the
age
,
who
took
all
opportunities
of
ridiculing
and
discouraging
the
adherents
of
knowledge
and
philosophy
.
<EOS>
After
this
exhortation
,
they
had
no
pretence
for
carrying
on
the
dispute
,
which
was
dropt
,
in
all
appearance
,
tho
'
<EOS>
the
mechanick
still
retained
his
resentment
;
and
after
breakfast
,
when
the
company
broke
up
,
accosted
his
adversary
in
the
street
,
desiring
to
know
how
he
durst
be
so
insolent
as
to
make
that
scurrilous
reflection
upon
his
family
<EOS>
:
the
fly
-
fancier
,
thus
questioned
,
accused
the
mathematician
of
having
been
the
aggressor
,
in
likening
his
head
to
a
light
cabbage
;
and
here
the
altercation
being
renewed
,
the
engineer
proceeded
to
the
illustration
of
his
mechanicks
,
tilting
up
his
hand
like
a
ballance
,
thrusting
it
forward
by
way
of
lever
,
embracing
the
naturalist
's
nose
like
a
wedge
betwixt
two
of
his
fingers
,
and
turning
it
round
,
with
the
momentum
of
a
screw
or
peritrochium
.
    
<EOS>
Had
they
been
obliged
to
decide
the
dispute
,
with
equal
arms
,
the
assailant
would
have
had
a
great
advantage
over
the
other
,
who
was
very
much
his
inferior
in
muscular
strength
;
but
the
philosopher
,
being
luckily
provided
with
a
cane
,
no
sooner
disengaged
himself
from
this
opprobrious
application
,
than
he
handled
his
weapon
with
great
dexterity
about
the
head
and
shoulders
of
his
antagonist
,
who
,
finding
this
shower
of
blows
very
disagreeable
,
was
fain
to
betake
himself
to
his
heels
for
shelter
,
and
was
pursued
by
the
angry
victor
,
who
chased
him
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
,
affording
unspeakable
satisfaction
to
the
multitude
,
as
well
as
to
our
hero
and
his
introductor
,
who
were
spectators
of
the
whole
scene
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
was
our
adventurer
initiated
in
the
society
of
Yelpers
,
tho
'
<EOS>
he
did
not
as
yet
fully
understand
the
nature
of
his
office
,
which
was
explained
by
the
young
physician
,
who
chid
him
for
his
blunt
behaviour
in
the
case
of
the
medal
;
and
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
their
patron
's
favour
was
neither
to
be
gained
,
nor
preserved
by
any
man
that
would
pretend
to
convict
him
of
a
mistake
:
he
therefore
counselled
him
to
respect
this
foible
,
and
cultivate
the
old
gentleman
with
all
the
zeal
and
veneration
,
which
a
regard
to
his
own
character
would
permit
him
to
pay
.
<EOS>
This
task
was
the
easier
to
one
of
our
young
gentleman
's
pliant
disposition
,
because
the
virtuoso
's
behaviour
was
absolutely
free
from
that
insolent
self
-
conceit
,
which
he
could
not
bear
without
disgust
:
<EOS>
the
senior
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
mild
and
beneficent
;
and
Pickle
was
rather
pleased
than
shocked
at
this
weakness
,
because
it
flattered
his
vanity
with
the
supposition
of
his
own
superior
sense
.
    
<EOS>
Cautioned
in
this
manner
,
Peregrine
profited
so
much
by
his
insinuating
qualifications
,
that
,
in
a
very
little
time
,
he
was
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
chief
favourites
of
the
patron
,
to
whom
he
dedicated
a
small
occasional
poem
;
and
every
body
believed
he
would
reap
the
fruits
of
his
attachment
,
among
the
first
of
the
old
gentleman
's
dependants
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
CIV
Peregrine
finding
himself
neglected
by
Sir
Steady
Steerwell
,
expostulates
with
him
in
a
letter
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
is
forbid
his
house
,
loses
his
pension
,
and
incurs
the
reputation
of
a
lunatick
.
   
<EOS>
This
prospect
of
success
,
together
with
his
expectations
from
the
minister
,
whom
he
did
not
neglect
,
helped
to
comfort
him
under
the
reverse
of
fortune
which
he
had
undergone
,
and
the
uncertainty
of
the
law
-
suit
,
which
he
still
maintained
for
the
recovery
of
his
ten
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
lawyers
,
indeed
,
continued
to
drain
his
pocket
of
money
,
while
they
filled
his
brain
with
unsubstantial
hope
;
and
he
was
actually
obliged
to
borrow
money
from
his
book
-
seller
,
on
the
strength
of
the
translation
,
in
order
to
satisfy
the
demands
of
those
ravenous
harpies
,
rather
than
lay
the
misanthrope
under
any
difficulties
,
or
have
recourse
to
his
friend
Hatchway
,
who
lived
at
the
garrison
,
intirely
ignorant
of
his
distress
:
and
this
was
not
at
all
alleviated
by
the
arrival
of
the
Indiaman
,
in
which
he
had
ventured
seven
hundred
pounds
,
as
we
have
already
observed
;
for
he
was
given
to
understand
,
that
the
borrower
was
left
dangerously
ill
at
Bombay
when
the
ship
sailed
,
and
that
his
chance
for
retrieving
his
money
was
extremely
slender
.
    
<EOS>
So
situated
,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
led
a
life
of
tranquillity
,
tho
'
he
made
a
shift
to
struggle
with
the
remonstrances
of
misfortune
:
yet
such
a
gush
of
affliction
would
sometimes
rush
upon
his
thought
,
as
overwhelmed
all
the
ideas
of
his
hope
,
and
sunk
him
to
the
very
bottom
of
despondence
.
<EOS>
Every
equipage
that
passed
him
in
the
street
,
every
person
of
rank
and
fortune
that
occurred
to
his
view
,
recalled
the
gay
images
of
his
former
life
,
with
such
mortifying
reflection
as
stabbed
him
to
the
very
soul
.
<EOS>
He
lived
,
therefore
,
incessantly
exposed
to
all
the
pangs
of
envy
and
disquiet
.
<EOS>
When
I
say
envy
,
I
do
not
mean
that
sordid
passion
,
in
consequence
of
which
a
man
repines
at
his
neighbour
's
success
,
howsoever
deserved
;
but
that
self
-
tormenting
indignation
which
is
inspired
by
the
prosperity
of
folly
,
ignorance
and
vice
.
<EOS>
Without
the
intervening
gleams
of
enjoyment
,
which
he
felt
in
the
conversation
of
a
few
friends
,
he
could
not
have
supported
his
existence
;
or
,
at
least
,
he
must
,
have
suffered
some
violent
discomposure
of
the
brain
:
but
one
is
still
finding
some
circumstance
of
alleviation
,
even
in
the
worst
of
conjunctures
;
and
Pickle
was
so
ingenious
in
these
researches
,
that
he
maintained
a
good
battle
with
disappointment
,
till
the
revolution
of
the
term
at
which
he
had
received
his
pension
of
three
hundred
pounds
.
    
<EOS>
However
,
seeing
the
day
elapse
,
without
touching
his
allowance
,
notwithstanding
his
significant
method
of
presenting
himself
at
the
minister
's
levee
,
when
the
year
was
expired
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
Sir
Steady
,
reminding
him
of
his
situation
and
promise
,
and
giving
him
to
understand
,
that
his
occasions
were
such
,
as
compelled
him
to
demand
his
salary
for
the
ensuing
year
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
morning
after
this
letter
was
conveyed
,
the
author
went
to
his
honour
's
house
,
in
expectation
of
being
admitted
by
particular
order
;
but
was
mistaken
in
his
hope
,
the
minister
not
being
visible
.
<EOS>
He
then
made
his
appearance
at
the
levee
,
in
hopes
of
being
closetted
;
but
though
he
took
all
opportunities
of
watching
Sir
Steady
's
eyes
,
he
could
not
obtain
one
glance
,
and
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
retire
,
without
being
favoured
with
the
least
notice
.
<EOS>
These
circumstances
of
wilful
neglect
were
not
over
and
above
agreeable
to
our
hero
,
who
,
in
the
agonies
of
vexation
and
resentment
,
went
home
,
and
composed
a
most
acrimonious
remonstrance
to
his
honour
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
was
not
only
deprived
of
all
pretensions
to
a
private
audience
,
but
expressly
denied
admittance
on
a
public
day
,
by
Sir
Steady
's
own
order
.
    
<EOS>
This
prohibition
,
which
announced
his
total
ruin
,
filled
him
with
rage
,
horror
and
despair
:
he
cursed
the
porter
who
signified
the
minister
's
command
,
threatening
to
chastise
him
upon
the
spot
for
his
presumption
,
and
vented
the
most
virulent
imprecations
upon
his
master
,
to
the
astonishment
of
those
who
chanced
to
enter
during
this
conference
.
<EOS>
Having
exhausted
himself
in
these
vain
exclamations
,
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
in
a
most
frantic
condition
,
biting
his
lips
so
that
the
blood
ran
from
his
mouth
,
dashing
his
head
and
fists
against
the
sides
of
his
chimney
,
and
weeping
with
the
most
bitter
expressions
of
woe
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
,
whose
perception
had
been
just
sufficient
to
let
him
see
,
that
there
was
some
difference
between
the
present
and
former
situation
of
his
master
,
over
-
hearing
his
transports
,
essayed
to
enter
his
apartment
,
with
a
view
of
administring
consolation
;
and
finding
the
door
locked
on
the
inside
,
desired
admittance
,
protesting
,
that
otherwise
he
would
down
with
the
bulk
-
head
,
in
the
turning
of
an
hand
-
spike
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
ordered
him
to
retire
,
on
pain
of
his
displeasure
,
and
swore
,
that
if
he
should
offer
to
break
open
the
door
,
he
would
instantly
shoot
him
through
the
head
.
<EOS>
Tom
,
without
paying
the
least
regard
to
this
injunction
,
set
himself
at
work
immediately
;
and
his
master
,
exasperated
at
his
want
of
reverence
and
respect
,
which
,
in
his
present
paroxysm
,
appeared
with
the
most
provoking
aggravation
,
flew
into
his
closet
,
and
snatching
up
one
of
his
pistols
already
loaded
<EOS>
,
no
sooner
saw
his
valet
enter
the
apartment
,
in
consequence
of
having
forced
the
lock
,
than
he
presented
full
at
his
face
,
and
drew
the
trigger
,
but
happily
the
priming
flashed
in
the
pan
,
without
communicating
with
the
charge
;
so
that
his
furious
purpose
did
not
take
effect
upon
the
countenance
of
honest
Pipes
,
who
disregardful
of
the
attempt
,
though
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
piece
,
asked
,
without
the
least
alteration
of
feature
,
if
it
must
be
foul
weather
through
the
whole
voyage
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
mad
as
he
was
,
repented
of
his
mischievous
intent
against
such
a
faithful
adherent
,
in
the
very
moment
of
execution
;
and
had
it
proved
fatal
,
according
to
the
design
,
in
all
probability
he
would
have
applied
another
to
his
own
head
.
    
<EOS>
There
are
certain
considerations
that
strike
upon
the
mind
with
irresistible
force
,
even
in
the
midst
of
its
distraction
;
the
momentary
recollection
of
some
particular
scene
,
occasioned
by
the
features
of
the
devoted
victim
,
hath
often
struck
the
dagger
from
the
assassin
's
hand
.
<EOS>
By
such
an
impulse
was
Pipes
protected
from
any
repeated
effort
of
his
master
's
rage
;
the
friendly
cause
of
his
present
disobedience
flashed
upon
the
conviction
of
Peregrine
,
when
he
beheld
the
rugged
front
of
his
valet
,
in
which
also
stood
disclosed
his
long
and
faithful
service
,
together
with
the
recommendation
of
the
deceased
commodore
.
    
<EOS>
Though
his
wrath
was
immediately
suppressed
,
and
his
heart
torn
with
remorse
for
what
he
had
done
,
his
brows
remained
still
contracted
;
and
darting
a
most
ferocious
regard
at
the
intruder
,
"
Villain
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
how
dare
you
treat
me
with
such
disrespect
?
"
<EOS>
"
Why
should
n't
I
lend
a
hand
for
the
preservation
of
the
ship
,
(
answered
the
unruffled
Pipes
)
when
there
is
more
sail
than
ballast
aboard
,
and
the
pilot
quits
the
helm
in
despair
?
<EOS>
What
signifies
one
or
two
broken
voyages
,
so
long
as
our
timbers
are
strong
,
and
our
vessel
in
good
trim
:
if
she
loses
upon
one
tack
,
mayhap
she
may
gain
upon
another
;
and
I
'll
be
damn'd
,
if
one
day
or
other
we
do
n't
fetch
up
our
lee
-
way
:
as
for
the
matter
of
provision
,
you
have
started
a
pretty
good
stock
of
money
into
my
hold
,
and
you
are
welcome
to
hoist
it
up
again
when
you
wool
?
"
    
<EOS>
Here
Tom
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Mr
Crabtree
,
who
seeing
Peregrine
with
a
pistol
in
his
hand
,
and
such
wild
disorder
in
his
looks
,
his
head
,
hands
and
mouth
besmeared
with
blood
,
and
,
moreover
,
smelling
the
gunpowder
which
had
been
burnt
,
actually
believed
he
had
either
committed
,
or
was
bent
upon
murder
,
and
,
accordingly
,
retreated
down
stairs
with
infinite
dispatch
;
though
all
his
speed
could
not
convey
him
without
the
reach
of
Pipes
,
who
overtaking
him
in
the
passage
,
carried
him
back
into
his
master
's
apartment
,
observing
by
the
way
,
that
this
was
no
time
to
sheer
off
,
when
his
consort
stood
in
need
of
his
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
something
so
ruefully
severe
in
the
countenance
of
Cadwallader
,
thus
compelled
,
that
at
any
other
time
,
our
hero
would
have
laughed
at
his
concern
;
but
at
present
,
there
was
nothing
risible
in
his
disposition
:
he
had
,
however
,
laid
aside
his
pistol
,
and
endeavoured
,
though
in
vain
,
to
compose
his
internal
disturbance
;
for
he
could
not
utter
one
syllable
to
the
Misanthrope
,
but
stood
staring
at
him
in
silence
,
with
a
most
delirious
aspect
,
which
did
not
tend
to
dispel
the
dismay
of
his
friend
,
who
,
after
some
recollection
,
"
I
wonder
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
that
you
have
never
killed
your
man
before
.
<EOS>
Pray
,
how
may
you
have
disposed
of
the
body
?
<EOS>
"
Pickle
having
recovered
the
faculty
of
speech
,
ordered
his
lacquey
out
of
the
room
,
and
in
a
most
incoherent
detail
,
made
Crabtree
acquainted
with
the
perfidious
conduct
of
the
minister
.
    
<EOS>
The
confident
was
very
glad
to
find
his
fears
disappointed
;
for
he
had
really
concluded
,
that
some
life
was
lost
:
and
perceiving
the
youth
too
much
agitated
to
be
treated
by
him
in
his
usual
stile
,
he
owned
that
Sir
Steady
was
a
rascal
,
encouraged
Pickle
with
the
hope
of
being
one
day
able
to
make
reprisals
upon
him
;
in
the
mean
time
,
offered
hi
money
for
his
immediate
occasions
,
exhorted
him
to
exert
his
own
qualifications
in
rendering
himself
independent
of
such
miscreants
,
and
finally
,
counselled
him
to
represent
his
wrongs
to
the
nobleman
whom
he
had
formerly
obliged
,
with
a
view
of
interesting
that
peer
in
his
behalf
,
or
at
least
of
obtaining
a
satisfactory
explanation
from
the
minister
,
that
he
might
take
no
premature
measures
of
revenge
.
    
<EOS>
These
admonitions
were
so
much
milder
,
and
more
agreeable
than
our
hero
expected
from
the
Misanthrope
,
that
they
had
a
very
favourable
effect
upon
his
transports
,
which
gradually
subsided
,
until
he
became
so
tractable
,
as
to
promise
that
he
would
conform
to
his
advice
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
next
morning
waited
upon
his
lordship
,
who
received
him
very
politely
,
as
usual
,
and
with
great
patience
heard
his
complaint
,
which
,
by
the
bye
,
he
could
not
repeat
without
some
hasty
ebullitions
of
passionate
resentment
.
<EOS>
This
peer
,
after
having
gently
disapproved
of
the
letter
of
postulation
,
which
had
produced
such
unfortunate
effects
,
kindly
undertook
to
recommend
his
case
to
the
minister
,
and
actually
performed
his
promise
that
same
day
,
when
Sir
Steady
informed
him
,
to
his
utter
astonishment
,
that
the
poor
young
gentleman
was
disordered
in
his
brain
,
so
that
he
could
not
possibly
be
provided
for
in
a
place
of
importance
,
with
any
regard
to
the
service
;
and
it
could
not
be
expected
that
he
(
Sir
Steady
)
would
support
his
extravagance
from
his
own
private
purse
:
that
he
had
indeed
,
at
the
solicitation
of
a
nobleman
deceased
,
made
him
a
present
of
three
hundred
pounds
,
in
consideration
of
some
loss
that
he
pretended
to
have
sustained
in
an
election
;
but
,
since
that
time
,
had
perceived
in
him
such
indisputable
marks
of
lunacy
,
both
by
his
distracted
letters
and
personal
behaviour
,
as
obliged
him
to
give
order
,
that
he
should
not
be
admitted
into
the
house
.
    
<EOS>
To
corroborate
this
assertion
,
the
minister
actually
called
in
the
evidence
of
his
own
porter
,
and
one
of
the
gentlemen
of
his
houshold
,
who
had
heard
the
execrations
that
escaped
our
youth
,
when
he
first
found
himself
excluded
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
the
nobleman
was
convinced
,
that
Peregrine
was
certainly
and
bona
fide
mad
as
a
March
hare
;
and
,
by
the
help
of
this
intimation
,
began
to
recollect
some
symptoms
of
distraction
which
appeared
in
his
last
visit
;
he
remembered
a
certain
incoherence
in
his
speech
,
a
violence
of
gesture
and
wildness
of
look
,
that
now
evidently
denoted
a
disturbed
understanding
:
and
he
determined
,
for
his
own
credit
and
security
,
to
disentangle
himself
from
such
a
dangerous
acquaintance
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
view
,
he
,
in
imitation
of
Sir
Steady
,
commanded
his
gate
to
be
shut
against
our
adventurer
;
so
that
when
he
went
to
know
the
result
of
his
lordship
's
conference
with
the
minister
,
the
door
was
flung
in
his
face
,
and
the
janitor
told
him
through
an
iron
grate
,
that
he
needed
not
give
himself
the
trouble
of
calling
again
,
for
his
lord
desired
to
be
excused
from
seeing
him
.
<EOS>
He
spoke
not
a
word
in
answer
to
this
declaration
,
which
he
immediately
imputed
to
the
ill
offices
of
the
minister
,
against
whom
he
breathed
defiance
and
revenge
,
in
his
way
to
the
lodgings
of
Cadwallader
;
who
being
made
acquainted
with
the
manner
of
his
reception
,
begg'd
<EOS>
he
would
desist
from
all
schemes
of
vengeance
,
until
he
(
Crabtree
)
should
be
able
to
unriddle
the
mystery
of
the
whole
,
which
he
did
not
doubt
of
unveiling
,
by
means
of
his
acquaintance
with
a
family
,
in
which
his
lordship
often
spent
the
evening
at
whist
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
long
before
he
had
the
desired
opportunity
;
the
nobleman
being
under
no
injunctions
or
obligation
to
keep
the
affair
secret
,
discovered
the
young
gentleman
's
misfortune
,
by
way
of
news
,
to
the
first
company
in
which
he
happened
to
be
;
and
Peregrine
's
name
was
not
so
obscure
in
the
fashionable
world
,
but
that
his
disorder
became
the
general
topic
of
conversation
for
a
day
;
so
that
his
friend
soon
partook
of
the
intelligence
,
and
found
means
to
learn
the
particulars
of
the
minister
's
information
,
as
above
related
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
was
in
danger
of
becoming
a
proselyte
to
Sir
Steady
's
opinion
,
when
he
recalled
and
compared
every
circumstance
which
he
knew
of
Pickle
's
impatience
and
impetuosity
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
nothing
more
easily
gains
credit
than
an
imputation
of
madness
fixed
upon
any
person
whatsoever
:
for
when
the
suspicion
of
the
world
is
roused
,
and
its
observation
once
set
at
work
,
the
wisest
,
the
coolest
man
upon
earth
,
will
,
by
some
particulars
in
his
behaviour
,
convict
himself
of
the
charge
:
every
singularity
in
his
dress
and
manner
(
and
such
are
observable
in
every
person
)
<EOS>
that
before
passed
unheeded
,
now
rises
up
in
judgment
against
him
,
with
all
the
exaggeration
of
the
observer
's
fancy
;
and
the
sagacious
examiner
perceives
distraction
in
every
glance
of
the
eye
,
turn
of
the
finger
,
and
motion
of
the
head
:
when
he
speaks
,
there
is
a
strange
peculiarity
in
his
argument
and
expression
;
when
he
holds
his
tongue
,
his
imagination
teems
with
some
extravagant
reverie
;
his
sobriety
of
demeanour
is
no
other
than
a
lucid
interval
,
and
his
passion
mere
delirium
.
    
<EOS>
If
people
of
the
most
sedate
and
insipid
life
and
conversation
are
subject
to
such
criticisms
,
no
wonder
that
they
should
take
place
upon
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
fiery
disposition
,
which
,
on
some
occasions
,
would
have
actually
justified
any
remarks
of
this
kind
,
which
his
greatest
enemies
could
make
.
<EOS>
He
was
accordingly
represented
as
one
of
those
enterprizing
Bucks
,
who
,
after
having
spent
their
fortunes
in
riot
and
excess
,
are
happily
bereft
of
their
understanding
,
and
consequently
insensible
of
the
want
and
disgrace
which
they
have
intailed
upon
themselves
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
himself
was
so
much
affected
with
the
report
,
that
for
some
time
he
hesitated
in
his
deliberations
upon
our
hero
,
before
he
could
prevail
upon
himself
to
communicate
to
him
the
information
he
had
received
,
or
to
treat
him
in
other
respects
as
a
man
of
sound
intellects
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
he
ventured
to
make
Pickle
acquainted
with
the
particulars
he
had
learn'd
,
imparting
them
with
such
caution
and
circumlocution
,
as
he
thought
necessary
to
prevent
the
young
gentleman
from
transgressing
all
bounds
of
temper
and
moderation
:
but
,
for
once
,
he
was
agreably
deceived
in
his
prognostic
.
<EOS>
Incensed
as
our
hero
was
at
the
conduct
of
the
minister
,
he
could
not
help
laughing
at
the
ridiculous
aspersion
,
which
,
he
told
his
friend
,
he
would
soon
refute
in
a
manner
that
should
not
be
very
agreeable
to
his
calumniator
;
observing
that
it
was
a
common
practice
with
this
state
pilot
,
thus
to
slander
those
people
to
whom
he
lay
under
obligations
which
he
had
no
mind
to
discharge
.
    
<EOS>
"
True
it
is
,
(
said
Peregrine
)
<EOS>
he
has
succeeded
more
than
once
in
contrivances
of
this
kind
,
having
actually
reduced
divers
people
of
weak
heads
to
such
extremity
of
despair
,
as
hath
issued
in
downright
distraction
,
whereby
he
was
rid
of
their
importunities
,
and
his
judgment
confirmed
at
the
same
time
:
<EOS>
but
I
have
now
(
thank
heaven
)
attained
to
such
a
pitch
of
philosophical
resolution
,
as
will
support
me
against
all
his
machinations
;
and
I
will
forthwith
exhibit
the
monster
to
the
public
,
in
his
true
lineaments
of
craft
,
perfidy
and
ingratitude
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
indeed
was
the
plan
with
which
Mr
Pickle
had
amused
himself
during
the
researches
of
Crabtree
;
and
by
this
time
it
so
effectually
flattered
his
imagination
,
that
he
believed
he
should
be
able
to
bring
his
adversary
(
in
spite
of
all
his
power
)
to
his
own
terms
of
submission
,
by
distinguishing
himself
in
the
list
of
those
who
,
at
that
period
,
wrote
against
the
administration
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
this
scheme
so
extravagant
as
it
may
seem
to
be
,
had
not
he
overlooked
one
material
circumstance
,
which
Cadwallader
himself
did
not
recollect
,
when
he
approved
of
this
project
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
meditated
vengeance
,
the
fame
of
his
disorder
,
in
due
course
of
circulation
,
reached
the
ears
of
that
lady
of
quality
,
whose
memoirs
have
appeared
in
the
third
volume
of
these
adventures
.
<EOS>
The
correspondence
with
which
she
had
honoured
our
hero
had
been
long
broke
off
,
for
the
reason
already
advanced
,
namely
,
his
dread
of
being
exposed
to
her
infatuating
charms
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
candid
enough
to
make
her
acquainted
with
this
cause
of
exiling
himself
from
her
presence
;
and
she
admitted
the
prudence
of
his
self
-
restraint
,
although
she
could
have
been
very
well
satisfied
with
the
continuance
of
his
intimacy
and
conversation
,
which
were
not
at
all
beneath
the
desire
of
any
lady
in
the
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
interruption
,
she
still
retained
a
friendship
and
regard
for
his
character
,
and
felt
all
the
affliction
of
a
humane
heart
,
at
the
news
of
his
misfortunes
and
deplorable
distemper
.
    
<EOS>
She
had
seen
him
courted
and
cultivated
in
the
sun
-
shine
of
his
prosperity
;
but
she
knew
from
sad
experience
,
how
all
those
insect
followers
shrink
away
in
the
winter
of
distress
.
<EOS>
Her
compassion
represented
him
as
a
poor
unhappy
lunatic
,
destitute
of
all
the
necessaries
of
life
,
dragging
about
the
ruins
of
human
nature
,
and
exhibiting
the
spectacle
of
blasted
youth
,
to
the
scorn
and
abhorrence
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
Aking
with
these
charitable
considerations
,
she
found
means
to
learn
in
what
part
of
the
town
he
lodged
;
and
laying
aside
all
superfluous
ceremony
,
went
in
a
hackney
-
chair
to
his
door
,
which
was
opened
by
the
ever
-
faithful
Pipes
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
immediately
recollected
the
features
of
this
trusty
follower
,
whom
she
could
not
help
loving
in
her
heart
,
for
his
attachment
and
fidelity
,
which
,
after
she
had
applauded
with
a
most
gracious
commendation
,
she
kindly
inquired
after
the
state
of
his
master
's
health
,
and
asked
if
he
was
in
a
condition
to
be
seen
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
,
who
could
not
suppose
that
the
visit
of
a
fine
lady
would
be
unacceptable
to
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
complexion
,
made
no
verbal
reply
to
the
question
;
but
beckoning
her
ladyship
with
an
arch
significance
of
feature
,
at
which
she
could
not
forbear
smiling
,
he
walked
softly
up
stairs
;
and
she
,
in
obedience
to
the
signal
,
followed
her
guide
into
the
apartment
of
our
hero
,
whom
she
found
at
a
writing
-
table
,
in
the
very
act
of
composing
an
eulogium
upon
his
good
friend
Sir
Steady
.
    
<EOS>
The
nature
of
his
work
had
animated
his
countenance
with
an
uncommon
degree
of
vivacity
;
and
being
dressed
in
a
neat
dishabille
,
his
figure
could
not
have
appeared
to
more
advantage
,
in
the
eye
of
a
person
who
despised
the
tinsel
of
unnecessary
ornament
.
<EOS>
She
was
extremely
well
pleased
to
see
the
expectations
so
agreeably
disappointed
;
for
,
instead
of
the
squalid
circumstances
and
wretched
looks
attending
indigence
and
distraction
,
every
thing
was
decent
and
genteel
;
and
the
patient
's
aspect
<EOS>
such
,
as
betokened
internal
satisfaction
.
<EOS>
Hearing
the
rustling
of
silk
in
his
room
,
he
lifted
up
his
eyes
from
the
paper
,
and
seeing
her
ladyship
,
was
struck
with
astonishment
and
awe
,
as
at
the
unexpected
apparition
of
some
supernatural
being
.
    
<EOS>
Before
he
could
recollect
himself
from
his
confusion
,
which
called
the
blood
into
his
cheeks
,
she
told
him
,
that
,
on
the
strength
of
old
acquaintance
,
she
was
come
to
visit
him
,
though
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
given
her
good
reason
to
believe
,
he
had
absolutely
forgot
that
there
was
such
a
person
as
she
in
being
.
<EOS>
After
having
made
the
most
warm
acknowledgments
for
this
unforeseen
honour
,
he
assured
her
ladyship
,
that
the
subject
of
her
reproach
was
not
his
fault
,
but
rather
his
very
great
misfortune
;
and
that
if
it
had
been
in
his
power
to
forget
her
so
easily
,
as
she
seemed
to
imagine
,
he
should
never
have
given
her
cause
to
tax
him
with
want
of
duty
and
respect
.
    
<EOS>
Still
dubious
of
his
situation
,
she
began
to
converse
with
him
on
different
subjects
;
and
he
acquitted
himself
so
well
in
every
particular
,
that
she
no
longer
doubted
his
having
been
misrepresented
by
the
malice
of
his
enemies
;
and
candidly
told
him
the
cause
and
intent
of
her
coming
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
not
deficient
in
expressions
of
gratitude
for
this
instance
of
her
generosity
and
friendship
,
which
even
drew
tears
from
his
eyes
;
and
as
to
the
imputation
of
madness
,
he
explained
it
so
much
to
her
ladyship
's
satisfaction
,
that
she
evidently
perceived
he
had
been
barbarously
dealt
with
,
and
that
the
charge
was
no
other
than
a
most
villainous
aspersion
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
all
his
endeavours
to
conceal
the
true
state
of
his
finances
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
give
this
detail
,
without
disclosing
some
of
the
difficulties
under
which
he
laboured
;
and
her
ladyship
's
sagacity
divining
the
rest
,
she
not
only
made
him
a
tender
of
assistance
,
but
presenting
a
bank
-
note
for
a
considerable
sum
,
insisted
upon
his
acceptance
of
it
,
as
a
trifling
mark
of
her
esteem
,
and
a
specimen
of
what
she
was
inclined
to
do
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
But
this
mark
of
her
benevolence
he
would
by
no
means
receive
;
assuring
her
,
that
though
his
affairs
were
at
present
a
little
perplexed
,
he
had
never
felt
the
least
circumstance
of
distress
,
and
begging
that
she
would
not
subject
him
to
the
burthen
of
such
an
unnecessary
obligation
.
    
<EOS>
Being
obliged
to
put
up
with
this
refusal
,
she
protested
she
would
never
forgive
him
,
should
she
ever
hear
that
he
rejected
her
offer
,
when
he
stood
in
need
of
her
aid
;
or
if
in
time
to
come
,
he
should
not
apply
to
her
friendship
,
if
ever
he
should
find
himself
incommoded
in
point
of
fortune
:
"
An
over
-
delicacy
in
this
respect
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
I
shall
look
upon
as
a
disapprobation
of
my
own
conduct
;
because
I
myself
have
been
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
my
friends
,
in
such
emergencies
.
"
    
<EOS>
These
generous
remonstrances
and
marks
of
particular
friendship
,
could
not
fail
to
make
deep
impression
upon
the
heart
of
our
hero
,
which
still
smarted
from
the
former
impulse
of
her
charms
:
he
not
only
felt
all
those
transports
which
a
man
of
honour
and
sensibility
may
be
supposed
to
feel
upon
such
an
occasion
,
but
the
sentiments
of
a
more
tender
passion
awaking
in
his
breast
,
he
could
not
help
expressing
himself
in
terms
adapted
to
the
emotions
of
his
soul
;
and
at
length
plainly
told
her
,
that
were
he
disposed
to
be
a
beggar
,
he
would
ask
something
of
infinitely
more
importance
to
his
peace
,
than
the
charitable
assistance
she
had
proffered
.
    
<EOS>
Her
ladyship
had
too
much
penetration
to
mistake
his
meaning
;
but
as
she
did
not
chuse
to
encourage
his
advances
,
pretended
to
interpret
his
intimation
into
a
general
compliment
of
gallantry
,
and
in
a
jocose
manner
,
desired
he
would
not
give
her
any
reason
to
believe
his
lucid
interval
was
past
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
In
faith
,
my
lady
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
perceive
the
fit
coming
on
;
and
I
do
n't
see
why
I
may
not
use
the
privilege
of
my
distemper
,
so
far
as
to
declare
myself
one
of
your
most
passionate
admirers
.
"
<EOS>
"
If
you
do
,
(
replied
her
ladyship
)
<EOS>
I
shall
not
be
fool
enough
to
believe
a
madman
,
unless
I
were
assured
that
your
disorder
proceeded
from
your
love
:
and
that
this
was
the
case
,
I
suppose
you
would
find
it
difficult
to
prove
.
"
<EOS>
"
Nay
,
Madam
,
(
cried
the
youth
)
<EOS>
I
have
in
this
drawer
,
what
will
convince
you
of
my
having
been
mad
on
that
strain
;
and
since
you
doubt
my
pretensions
,
you
must
give
me
leave
to
produce
my
testimonials
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
opened
a
scrutore
,
and
taking
out
a
paper
,
presented
her
with
the
following
song
,
which
he
had
written
in
her
praise
,
immediately
after
he
was
made
acquainted
with
the
particulars
of
her
story
.

perused
this
production

"
Were
I
inclined
to
be
suspicious
,
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
I
should
believe
that
I
had
no
share
in
producing
this
composition
,
which
seems
to
have
been
inspired
by
a
much
more
amiable
object

However

I
will
take
your
word
for
your
intention
,
and
thank
you
for
the
unmerited
compliment
,
though
I
have
met
with
it
in
such
an
accidental
manner
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
must
be
so
free
as
to
tell
you
,
it
is
now
high
time
for
you
to
contract
that
unbounded
spirit
of
gallantry
,
which
you
have
indulged
so
long
,
into
a
sincere
attachment
for
the
fair
Emilia
,
who
,
by
all
accounts
,
deserves
the
whole
of
your
attention
and
regard
.

<EOS>
His
nerves
thrilled
at
mention
of
that
name
,
which
he
never
heard
pronounced
without
agitation
;
and
rather
than
undergo
the
consequence
of
a
conversation
upon
this
subject
,
he
chose
to
drop
the
theme
of
love
altogether
,
and
industriously
introduced
some
other
topic
of
discourse

My
lady
having
prolonged
her
stay
beyond
the
period
of
a
common
visit
,
and
repeated
her
protestations
in
the
most
frank
and
obliging
manner
,
took
her
leave
of
our

who
promised
to
pay
his
respects
to
her
in
a
few
days
,
at
her
own
house
.

Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
resumed
his
task
;
and
having
finished
a
most
severe
remonstrance
against
Sir
Steady
,
not
only
with
regard
to
his
private
ingratitude
,
but
also
to
his
male
-
administration
of
public
affairs
,
he
sent
it
to
the
author
of
a
weekly
paper
,
who
had
been
long
a
professed
reformer
in
politics
;
and
it
appeared
in
a
very
few
days
,
with
a
note
of
the
publisher
,
desiring
the
favour
of
a
further
correspondence
with
the
author
.
    
<EOS>
The
animadversions
contained
in
this
small
essay
were
so
spirited
and
judicious
,
and
a
great
many
new
lights
thrown
upon
the
subject
with
such
perspicuity
,
as
attracted
the
notice
of
the
public
in
an
extraordinary
manner
,
and
helped
to
raise
the
character
of
the
paper
in
which
it
was
inserted
.
<EOS>
The
minister
was
not
the
last
who
examined
the
performance
,
which
,
in
spite
of
all
his
boasted
temper
,
provoked
him
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
set
his
emissaries
at
work
,
and
by
dint
of
corruption
,
procured
a
sight
of
the
manuscript
in
Peregrine
's
own
hand
-
writing
,
which
he
immediately
recognized
;
and
,
for
further
confirmation
of
his
opinion
,
compared
with
the
two
letters
which
he
had
received
from
our
adventurer
.
<EOS>
Had
he
known
the
young
gentleman
's
talents
for
declamation
were
so
acute
,
perhaps
he
would
never
have
given
him
cause
to
complain
,
but
employed
him
in
the
vindication
of
his
own
measures
;
nay
,
he
might
still
have
treated
him
like
some
other
authors
whom
he
had
brought
over
from
the
opposition
,
had
not
the
keenness
of
this
first
assault
incensed
him
to
a
desire
of
revenge
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
no
sooner
made
this
discovery
,
than
he
conveyed
his
directions
to
his
dependant
,
the
receiver
general
,
who
was
possessed
of
Pickle
's
notes
;
and
next
day
,
while
our
author
stood
within
a
circle
of
his
acquaintance
,
at
a
certain
coffee
-
house
,
holding
forth
with
great
eloquence
upon
the
diseases
of
the
state
,
he
was
accosted
by
a
bailiff
,
who
entering
the
room
with
five
or
six
followers
,
told
him
aloud
,
that
he
had
a
writ
against
him
for
twelve
hundred
pounds
,
at
the
suit
of
Mr
Ravage
Gleanum
.
    
<EOS>
The
whole
company
were
astonished
at
this
address
,
which
did
not
fail
to
discompose
the
defendant
himself
,
who
(
as
it
were
instinctively
)
in
the
midst
of
his
confusion
,
saluted
the
officer
across
the
head
with
his
cane
;
in
consequence
of
which
application
,
he
was
surrounded
and
disarmed
in
an
instant
by
the
gang
,
who
carried
him
off
to
the
next
tavern
in
the
most
opprobrious
manner
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
one
of
the
spectators
interpose
in
his
behalf
,
or
visit
him
in
his
confinement
with
the
least
tender
of
advice
or
assistance
;
such
is
the
zeal
of
a
coffee
-
house
friendship
.
    
<EOS>
This
stroke
was
the
more
severe
upon
our
hero
,
as
it
was
altogether
unexpected
;
for
he
had
utterly
forgot
the
debt
for
which
he
was
arrested
.
<EOS>
His
present
indignation
was
,
however
,
chiefly
kindled
against
the
bailiff
,
who
had
done
his
office
in
such
a
disrespectful
manner
:
and
the
first
use
he
made
of
his
recollection
in
the
house
to
which
they
conducted
him
,
was
to
chastise
him
for
the
insolence
and
indecency
of
his
behaviour
.
<EOS>
This
task
he
performed
with
his
bare
fists
,
every
other
weapon
being
previously
conveyed
out
of
his
reach
;
and
the
delinquent
underwent
his
discipline
with
surprising
patience
and
resignation
,
asking
pardon
with
great
humility
,
and
protesting
before
God
,
that
he
had
never
willingly
and
wittingly
used
any
gentleman
with
ill
manners
,
but
had
been
commanded
to
arrest
our
adventurer
according
to
the
express
direction
of
the
creditor
,
on
pain
of
forfeiting
his
place
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
declaration
Peregrine
was
appeased
,
and
out
of
a
delirium
of
passion
,
waked
to
all
the
horrors
of
reflection
.
    
<EOS>
All
the
glory
of
his
youth
was
now
eclipsed
,
all
the
blossoms
of
his
hope
were
blasted
,
and
he
saw
himself
doomed
to
the
miseries
of
a
jail
,
without
the
least
prospect
of
enlargement
,
except
in
the
issue
of
his
law
-
suit
,
of
which
he
had
,
for
some
time
past
,
grown
less
and
less
confident
every
day
.
<EOS>
What
would
become
of
the
unfortunate
,
if
the
constitution
of
the
mind
did
not
permit
them
to
bring
one
passion
into
the
field
against
another
?
<EOS>
passions
that
operate
in
the
human
breast
,
like
poisons
of
a
different
nature
,
extinguishing
each
other
's
effect
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
's
grief
reigned
in
full
despotism
,
until
it
was
deposed
by
revenge
;
during
the
predominancy
of
which
,
he
considered
every
thing
which
had
happened
as
a
circumstance
conducive
to
its
gratification
:
"
If
I
must
be
prisoner
for
life
,
(
said
he
to
himself
)
if
I
must
relinquish
all
my
gay
expectations
,
let
me
at
least
have
the
satisfaction
of
clanking
my
chains
so
as
to
interrupt
the
repose
of
my
adversary
;
and
let
me
search
in
my
own
breast
for
that
peace
and
contentment
,
which
I
have
not
been
able
to
find
in
all
the
scenes
of
my
success
.
<EOS>
In
being
detached
from
the
world
,
I
shall
be
delivered
from
folly
and
ingratitude
,
as
well
as
exempted
from
an
expence
,
which
I
should
have
found
it
very
difficult
,
if
not
impracticable
,
to
support
;
I
shall
have
little
or
no
temptation
to
mispend
my
time
,
and
more
undisturbed
opportunity
to
earn
my
subsistence
,
and
prosecute
my
revenge
.
<EOS>
After
all
,
a
jail
is
the
best
tub
to
which
a
cynic
philosopher
can
retire
.
"
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
these
comfortable
reflections
,
he
sent
a
letter
to
Mr
Crabtree
,
with
an
account
of
his
misfortune
,
signifying
his
resolution
to
move
himself
immediately
into
the
Fleet
,
and
desiring
that
he
would
send
him
some
understanding
attorney
of
his
acquaintance
,
who
would
direct
him
in
the
steps
necessary
to
be
taken
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
The
Misanthrope
,
upon
the
receit
of
this
intimation
,
went
in
person
to
a
lawyer
,
whom
he
accompanied
to
the
spunging
-
house
,
whither
the
prisoner
had
by
this
time
retired
;
and
Peregrine
was
,
under
the
auspices
of
this
director
,
conducted
to
the
judge
's
chamber
,
where
he
was
left
in
the
custody
of
a
tipstaff
;
and
after
having
paid
for
a
warrant
of
Habeas
Corpus
,
by
him
conveyed
to
the
Fleet
,
and
delivered
to
the
care
of
the
warden
.
    
<EOS>
Here
he
was
introduced
to
the
lodge
,
in
which
he
was
obliged
to
expose
himself
a
full
half
hour
to
the
eyes
of
all
the
turnkeys
and
door
-
keepers
,
who
took
an
accuracy
survey
of
his
person
,
that
they
might
know
him
again
at
first
sight
;
and
then
he
was
turned
loose
into
the
place
called
the
master
's
side
,
having
given
a
valuable
consideration
for
that
privilege
.
<EOS>
This
is
a
large
range
of
building
,
containing
some
hundreds
of
lodging
-
rooms
for
the
convenience
of
the
prisoners
,
who
pay
so
much
per
week
for
that
accommodation
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
this
community
is
like
a
city
detached
from
all
communication
with
the
neighbouring
parts
,
regulated
by
its
own
laws
,
and
furnished
with
peculiar
conveniences
,
for
the
use
of
the
inhabitants
.
    
<EOS>
There
is
a
coffee
-
house
for
the
resort
of
gentlemen
,
in
which
all
sorts
of
liquors
are
kept
,
and
a
public
kitchen
,
where
any
quantity
of
meat
is
sold
at
a
very
reasonable
rate
,
or
any
kind
of
provision
boiled
and
roasted
gratis
,
for
the
poor
prisoners
:
<EOS>
nay
,
there
are
certain
servants
of
the
public
,
who
are
obliged
to
go
to
market
,
at
the
pleasure
of
individuals
,
without
see
or
reward
from
those
who
employ
them
:
nor
are
they
cooped
up
,
so
as
to
be
excluded
from
the
benefit
of
fresh
air
,
there
being
an
open
area
of
a
considerable
extent
adjacent
to
the
building
,
on
which
they
may
exercise
themselves
in
walking
,
skittles
,
bowls
,
and
variety
of
other
diversions
,
according
to
the
inclination
of
each
.
    
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
being
admitted
a
denizen
of
this
community
,
found
himself
bewildered
in
the
midst
of
strangers
,
who
,
by
their
appearance
,
did
not
at
all
prepossess
him
in
their
favour
;
and
after
having
strolled
about
the
place
with
his
friend
Cadwallader
,
repaired
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
in
order
to
be
further
informed
of
the
peculiar
customs
which
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
know
.
    
<EOS>
There
,
while
he
endeavoured
to
pick
up
intelligence
from
the
bar
-
keeper
,
he
was
accosted
by
a
person
in
canonicals
,
who
very
civilly
asking
if
he
was
a
new
-
comer
,
and
being
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
gave
him
the
salutation
of
welcome
to
the
society
,
and
,
with
great
hospitality
,
undertook
to
initiate
him
in
the
constitutions
of
the
brotherhood
.
    
<EOS>
This
humane
clergyman
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
his
first
care
ought
to
be
that
of
securing
a
lodging
;
telling
him
,
there
was
a
certain
number
of
apartments
in
the
prison
let
at
the
same
price
,
though
some
were
more
commodious
than
others
;
and
that
when
the
better
sort
became
vacant
,
by
the
removal
of
their
possessors
,
those
who
succeeded
in
point
of
seniority
,
had
the
privilege
of
occupying
the
empty
tenements
,
preferable
to
the
rest
of
the
inhabitants
,
howsoever
respectable
they
might
otherwise
be
:
that
when
the
jail
was
very
much
crowded
,
there
was
but
one
chamber
allotted
for
two
lodgers
;
but
this
was
not
considered
as
any
great
hardship
on
the
prisoners
,
because
,
in
that
case
,
there
was
always
a
sufficient
number
of
males
,
who
willingly
admitted
the
females
to
a
share
of
their
apartments
and
beds
:
<EOS>
not
but
the
time
had
been
,
when
this
expedient
would
not
answer
the
occasion
,
because
,
after
a
couple
had
been
quartered
in
every
room
<EOS>
,
there
was
a
considerable
residue
still
unprovided
with
lodging
;
so
that
for
the
time
being
,
the
last
comers
were
obliged
to
take
up
their
habitation
in
Mount
Scoundrel
,
an
apartment
most
miserably
furnished
,
in
which
they
lay
promiscuously
amidst
filth
and
vermin
,
until
they
could
be
better
accommodated
in
due
course
of
rotation
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
hearing
the
description
of
this
place
,
began
to
be
very
impatient
about
his
night
's
lodging
;
and
the
parson
perceiving
his
anxiety
,
conducted
him
,
without
loss
of
time
,
to
the
warden
,
who
forthwith
put
him
in
possession
of
a
paultry
chamber
,
for
which
he
agreed
to
pay
half
a
crown
a
week
.
<EOS>
This
point
being
settled
,
his
director
gave
him
an
account
of
the
different
methods
of
eating
,
either
singly
,
in
a
mess
,
or
at
an
ordinary
;
and
advised
him
to
chuse
the
last
,
as
the
most
reputable
,
offering
to
introduce
him
next
day
to
the
best
company
in
the
Fleet
,
who
always
dined
together
in
public
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
having
thanked
this
gentleman
for
his
civilities
,
and
promised
to
be
governed
by
his
advice
,
invited
him
to
pass
the
evening
at
his
apartment
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
shut
himself
up
with
Crabtree
,
in
order
to
deliberate
upon
the
wreck
of
his
affairs
.
<EOS>
Of
all
his
ample
fortune
,
nothing
now
remained
but
his
wardrobe
,
which
was
not
very
sumptuous
,
about
thirty
guineas
in
cash
,
and
the
garison
,
which
the
Misanthrope
counselled
him
to
convert
into
ready
money
,
for
his
present
subsistence
.
    
<EOS>
This
advice
,
however
,
he
absolutely
rejected
,
not
only
on
account
of
his
having
already
bestowed
it
upon
Hatchway
,
during
the
term
of
his
natural
life
,
but
also
with
a
view
of
retaining
some
memorial
of
the
commodore
's
generosity
.
<EOS>
He
proposed
,
therefore
,
to
finish
in
this
retreat
the
translation
which
he
had
undertaken
,
and
earn
his
future
subsistence
by
labour
of
the
same
kind
.
<EOS>
He
desired
Cadwallader
to
take
charge
of
his
moveables
,
and
send
to
him
such
linen
and
cloaths
as
he
should
have
occasion
for
in
his
confinement
.
<EOS>
But
,
among
all
his
difficulties
,
nothing
embarassed
him
so
much
as
his
faithful
Pipes
,
whom
he
could
no
longer
entertain
in
his
service
.
<EOS>
He
knew
Tom
had
made
shift
to
pick
up
a
competency
in
the
course
of
his
ministration
;
but
that
reflection
,
though
it
in
some
measure
alleviated
,
could
not
wholly
prevent
the
mortification
he
must
suffer
in
parting
with
an
affectionate
adherent
,
who
was
by
this
time
become
as
necessary
to
him
as
one
of
his
own
members
,
and
who
was
so
accustomed
to
live
under
his
command
and
protection
,
that
he
did
not
believe
the
fellow
could
reconcile
himself
to
any
other
way
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
Crabtree
,
in
order
to
make
himself
easy
on
that
score
,
offered
to
adopt
him
in
the
room
of
his
own
valet
,
whom
he
would
dismiss
;
though
he
observed
,
that
Pipes
had
been
quite
spoiled
in
our
hero
's
service
.
<EOS>
But
Peregrine
did
not
chuse
to
lay
his
friend
under
that
inconvenience
,
knowing
that
his
present
lacquey
understood
and
complied
with
all
the
peculiarities
of
his
humour
,
which
Pipes
would
never
be
able
to
study
or
regard
;
and
therefore
determined
to
send
him
back
to
his
ship
-
mate
Hatchway
,
with
whom
he
had
spent
the
fore
-
part
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
These
points
being
adjusted
,
the
two
friends
adjourned
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
with
a
view
of
inquiring
into
the
character
of
the
clergyman
,
to
whose
beneficence
<EOS>
our
adventurer
was
so
much
indebted
;
and
they
learned
he
was
a
person
who
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
the
bishop
in
whose
diocese
he
was
settled
,
and
,
being
unequal
in
power
to
his
antagonist
,
had
been
driven
to
the
Fleet
,
in
consequence
of
his
obstinate
opposition
;
tho
'
<EOS>
he
still
found
means
to
enjoy
a
pretty
considerable
income
,
by
certain
irregular
practices
in
the
way
of
his
function
,
which
income
was
chiefly
consumed
in
acts
of
humanity
to
his
fellow
-
creatures
in
distress
.
    
<EOS>
His
eulogium
was
scarce
finished
,
when
he
entered
the
room
,
according
to
appointment
with
Peregrine
,
who
ordering
wine
and
something
for
supper
to
be
carried
to
his
apartment
,
the
triumvirate
went
thither
;
and
Cadwallader
taking
his
leave
for
the
night
,
the
two
fellow
-
prisoners
passed
the
evening
very
sociably
,
our
hero
being
entertained
by
his
new
companion
with
the
private
history
of
the
place
,
some
particulars
of
which
were
extremely
curious
.
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
that
the
person
who
attended
them
at
supper
,
bowing
with
the
most
abject
servility
,
and
worshipping
them
,
every
time
he
opened
his
mouth
,
with
the
epithets
of
your
Lordship
and
your
Honour
,
had
,
a
few
years
before
,
been
actually
a
captain
in
the
guards
;
who
,
after
having
run
his
career
in
the
great
world
,
had
threaded
every
station
in
their
community
,
from
that
of
a
buck
of
the
first
order
,
who
swaggers
about
the
Fleet
in
a
laced
coat
,
with
a
footman
and
whore
,
to
the
degree
of
a
tapster
,
in
which
he
was
now
happily
settled
.
    
<EOS>
"
If
you
will
take
the
trouble
of
going
into
the
cook
's
kitchen
(
said
he
)
,
you
will
perceive
a
beau
metamorphosed
into
a
turn
-
spit
;
and
there
are
some
hewers
of
wood
and
drawers
of
water
in
this
microcosm
,
who
have
had
forests
and
fish
-
ponds
of
their
own
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
such
a
miserable
reverse
of
fortune
,
they
are
neither
objects
of
regard
or
compassion
,
because
their
misfortunes
are
the
fruits
of
the
most
vicious
extravagance
,
and
they
are
absolutely
insensible
of
the
misery
which
is
their
lot
.
<EOS>
Those
of
our
fellow
-
sufferers
,
who
have
been
reduced
by
undeserved
losses
,
or
the
precipitation
of
unexperienced
youth
,
never
fail
to
meet
with
the
most
brotherly
assistance
,
provided
they
behave
with
decorum
,
and
a
due
sense
of
their
unhappy
circumstances
.
<EOS>
Nor
are
we
destitute
of
power
to
chastise
the
licentious
,
who
refuse
to
comply
with
the
regulations
of
the
place
,
and
disturb
the
peace
of
the
community
,
with
riot
and
disorder
.
<EOS>
Justice
is
here
impartially
administered
,
by
a
court
of
equity
,
consisting
of
a
select
number
of
the
most
respectable
inhabitants
,
who
punish
all
offenders
with
equal
judgment
,
and
resolution
,
after
they
have
been
fairly
convicted
of
the
crimes
laid
to
their
charge
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
clergyman
having
thus
explained
the
oeconomy
of
the
place
,
as
well
as
the
cause
of
his
own
confinement
,
began
to
discover
signs
of
curiosity
,
touching
our
hero
's
situation
;
and
Pickle
,
thinking
he
could
do
no
less
for
the
satisfaction
of
a
man
,
who
had
treated
him
in
such
an
hospitable
manner
,
favoured
him
with
a
detail
of
the
circumstances
which
produced
his
imprisonment
:
at
the
same
time
,
gratifying
his
resentment
against
the
minister
,
which
delighted
in
recapitulating
the
injuries
he
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
The
parson
,
who
had
been
prepossessed
in
favour
of
our
youth
at
first
sight
,
understanding
what
a
considerable
part
he
had
acted
on
the
stage
of
life
,
felt
his
veneration
increase
;
and
,
pleased
with
the
opportunity
of
introducing
a
stranger
of
his
consequence
to
the
club
,
left
him
to
his
repose
,
or
rather
to
ruminate
on
an
event
which
he
had
not
as
yet
seriously
considered
.
    
<EOS>
I
might
here
,
in
imitation
of
some
celebrated
writers
,
furnish
out
a
page
or
two
,
with
the
reflections
he
made
upon
the
instability
of
human
affairs
,
the
treachery
of
the
world
,
and
the
temerity
of
youth
;
and
endeavour
to
decoy
the
reader
into
a
smile
,
by
some
quaint
observation
of
my
own
,
touching
the
sagacious
moralizer
:
but
,
besides
that
I
look
upon
this
practice
as
an
impertinent
anticipation
of
the
peruser
's
thoughts
<EOS>
,
I
have
too
much
matter
of
importance
upon
my
hands
,
to
give
the
reader
the
least
reason
to
believe
that
I
am
driven
to
such
paultry
shifts
,
in
order
to
eke
out
the
volume
.
<EOS>
Suffice
it
then
,
to
say
,
our
adventurer
passed
a
very
uneasy
night
,
not
only
from
the
thorny
suggestions
of
his
mind
,
but
likewise
from
the
anguish
of
his
body
,
which
suffered
from
the
hardness
of
his
couch
,
as
well
as
from
the
natural
inhabitants
thereof
,
which
did
not
tamely
suffer
his
intrusion
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
morning
he
was
waked
by
Pipes
,
who
brought
upon
his
shoulder
a
portmanteau
filled
with
necessaries
,
according
to
the
direction
of
Cadwallader
;
and
tossing
it
down
upon
the
floor
,
regaled
himself
with
a
quid
,
without
the
least
manifestation
of
concern
.
<EOS>
After
some
pause
,
"
You
see
,
Pipes
,
(
said
his
master
)
to
what
I
have
brought
myself
.
"
<EOS>
"
Ey
,
ey
,
(
answered
the
valet
)
once
the
vessel
is
ashore
,
what
signifies
talking
?
    
<EOS>
We
must
bear
a
hand
to
tow
her
off
,
if
we
can
:
if
she
wo
n't
budge
for
all
the
anchors
and
capstans
aboard
,
after
we
have
lightened
her
,
by
cutting
away
her
masts
,
and
heaving
our
guns
and
cargo
overboard
,
why
then
,
mayhap
,
a
brisk
gale
of
wind
,
a
tide
,
or
current
setting
from
shore
,
may
float
her
again
in
the
blast
of
a
whistle
.
<EOS>
Here
is
two
hundred
and
ten
guineas
by
the
tale
,
in
this
here
canvas
-
bag
;
and
upon
this
scrap
of
paper
 
no
,
avast
 
<EOS>
that
's
my
discharge
from
the
parish
for
Moll
Trundle
 
<EOS>
ey
,
here
it
is
 
an
order
for
thirty
pounds
upon
the
what

d'ye

call-'em
in
the
city
;
and
two
tickets
for
twenty
-
five
and
eighteen
,
which
I
lent
,
d'ye
see
,
to
Sam
Studding
to
buy
a
cargo
of
rum
,
when
he
hoisted
the
sign
of
the
Commodore
at
St
Catherine
's
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
spread
his
whole
stock
upon
the
table
,
for
the
acceptance
of
Peregrine
;
who
,
being
very
much
affected
with
this
fresh
instance
of
his
attachment
,
expressed
his
satisfaction
at
seeing
he
had
been
such
a
good
oeconomist
,
paid
his
wages
up
to
that
very
day
,
thanked
him
for
his
faithful
services
,
and
,
observing
that
he
himself
was
no
longer
in
a
condition
to
maintain
a
domestick
,
advised
him
to
retire
to
the
garison
,
where
he
would
be
kindly
received
by
his
friend
Hatchway
,
to
whom
he
would
recommend
him
in
the
strongest
terms
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
looked
blank
at
this
unexpected
intimation
,
to
which
he
replied
,
that
he
wanted
neither
pay
nor
provision
,
but
only
to
be
employed
as
a
tender
;
and
that
he
would
not
steer
his
course
for
the
garison
,
unless
his
master
would
first
take
his
lumber
aboard
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
however
,
peremptorily
refused
to
touch
a
farthing
of
the
money
,
which
he
commanded
him
to
put
up
;
and
Pipes
was
so
mortified
at
his
refusal
,
that
,
twisting
the
notes
together
,
he
threw
them
into
the
fire
without
hesitation
,
crying
,
"
<EOS>
Damn
the
money
!
"
and
the
canvas
-
bag
,
with
its
contents
,
would
have
shared
the
same
fate
,
had
not
Peregrine
started
up
,
and
snatching
the
paper
from
the
flames
,
ordered
his
valet
to
forbear
,
on
pain
of
being
banished
for
ever
from
his
sight
.
<EOS>
He
told
him
,
that
,
for
the
present
,
there
was
a
necessity
for
his
being
dismissed
,
and
he
discharged
him
accordingly
;
but
if
he
would
go
and
live
quietly
with
the
lieutenant
,
he
promised
,
on
the
first
favourable
turn
of
his
fortune
,
to
take
him
again
into
his
service
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
he
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
neither
wanted
,
nor
would
make
any
use
of
his
money
,
which
he
insisted
upon
his
pocketing
immediately
,
on
pain
of
forfeiting
all
title
to
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
Pipes
was
very
much
chagrined
at
these
injunctions
,
to
which
he
made
no
reply
;
but
sweeping
the
money
into
his
bag
,
stalked
off
,
in
silence
,
with
a
look
of
grief
and
mortification
,
which
his
countenance
had
never
exhibited
before
.
<EOS>
Nor
was
the
proud
heart
of
Pickle
unmoved
upon
this
occasion
:
he
could
scarce
suppress
his
sorrow
in
the
presence
of
Pipes
,
and
,
soon
as
he
was
gone
,
it
vented
itself
in
tears
.
    
<EOS>
Having
no
great
pleasure
in
conversing
with
his
own
thoughts
,
he
dressed
himself
with
all
convenient
dispatch
,
being
attended
by
one
of
the
occasional
valets
of
the
place
,
who
had
formerly
been
a
rich
mercer
in
the
city
;
and
this
operation
being
performed
,
he
went
to
breakfast
at
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
happened
to
meet
with
his
friend
the
clergyman
,
and
several
persons
of
genteel
appearance
,
to
whom
the
doctor
introduced
him
as
a
new
mess
-
mate
.
    
<EOS>
By
these
gentlemen
he
was
conducted
to
a
place
,
where
they
spent
the
forenoon
in
playing
at
fives
,
an
exercise
in
which
our
hero
took
singular
delight
;
and
about
one
o'clock
a
court
was
held
,
for
the
trial
of
two
delinquents
,
who
had
transgressed
the
laws
of
honesty
and
good
order
.
    
<EOS>
The
first
who
appeared
at
the
bar
was
an
attorney
,
accused
of
having
picked
a
gentleman
's
pocket
of
his
handkerchief
;
and
the
fact
being
proved
by
incontestible
evidence
,
he
received
sentence
:
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
immediately
carried
to
the
public
pump
,
and
subjected
to
a
severe
cascade
of
cold
water
.
<EOS>
This
cause
being
discussed
<EOS>
,
they
proceeded
to
the
trial
of
the
other
offender
,
who
was
a
lieutenant
of
a
man
of
war
,
indicted
for
a
riot
,
which
he
had
committed
in
company
with
a
female
not
yet
taken
,
against
the
laws
of
the
place
,
and
the
peace
of
his
fellow
-
prisoners
.
<EOS>
The
culprit
had
been
very
obstreperous
,
and
absolutely
refused
to
obey
the
summons
,
with
many
expressions
of
contempt
and
defiance
against
the
authority
of
the
court
;
upon
which
the
constables
were
ordered
to
bring
him
to
the
bar
,
vi
&
armis
;
and
he
was
accordingly
brought
before
the
judge
,
after
having
made
a
most
desperate
resistance
with
a
hanger
,
by
which
one
of
the
officers
was
dangerously
wounded
.
<EOS>
This
outrage
was
such
an
aggravation
of
his
crime
,
that
the
court
would
not
venture
to
decide
upon
it
,
but
remitted
him
to
the
sentence
of
the
warden
;
who
,
by
virtue
of
his
dictatorial
power
,
ordered
the
rioter
to
be
loaded
with
irons
,
and
confined
in
the
strong
-
room
,
which
is
a
dismal
dungeon
,
situated
upon
the
side
of
the
ditch
,
infested
with
toads
and
vermin
,
surcharged
with
noisome
damps
,
and
impervious
to
the
least
ray
of
light
.
    
<EOS>
Justice
being
done
upon
the
criminals
,
our
adventurer
and
his
company
adjourned
to
the
ordinary
,
which
was
kept
at
the
coffee
-
house
;
and
he
found
,
upon
enquiry
,
that
his
mess
-
mates
consisted
of
one
officer
,
two
under
-
writers
,
three
projectors
,
an
alchymist
,
an
attorney
,
a
parson
,
a
brace
of
poets
,
a
baronet
,
and
a
knight
of
the
bath
.
<EOS>
The
dinner
,
tho
'
not
sumptuous
,
nor
very
elegantly
served
up
,
was
nevertheless
substantial
,
and
pretty
well
dressed
:
the
wine
was
tolerable
,
and
all
the
guests
as
chearful
as
if
they
had
been
utter
strangers
to
calamity
;
so
that
our
adventurer
began
to
relish
the
company
,
and
mix
in
the
conversation
,
with
that
sprightliness
and
ease
which
were
peculiar
to
his
disposition
.
<EOS>
The
repast
being
ended
,
the
reckoning
paid
,
and
part
of
the
gentlemen
withdrawn
to
cards
,
or
other
avocations
,
those
who
remained
,
among
whom
Peregrine
made
one
,
agreed
to
spend
the
afternoon
in
conversation
over
a
bowl
of
punch
;
and
the
liquor
being
produced
,
they
passed
the
time
very
socially
in
various
topicks
of
discourse
,
including
many
curious
anecdotes
relating
to
their
own
affairs
.
<EOS>
No
man
scrupled
to
own
the
nature
of
the
debt
for
which
he
was
confined
,
unless
it
happened
to
be
some
piddling
affair
;
but
,
on
the
contrary
,
boasted
of
the
importance
of
the
sum
,
as
a
circumstance
that
implied
his
having
been
a
person
of
consequence
in
life
;
and
he
who
had
made
the
most
remarkable
escapes
from
bailiffs
,
was
looked
upon
as
a
man
of
superior
genius
and
address
.
    
<EOS>
Among
other
extraordinary
adventures
of
this
kind
,
none
was
more
romantic
than
the
last
elopement
atchieved
by
the
officer
;
who
told
them
,
he
had
been
arrested
for
a
debt
of
two
hundred
pounds
,
at
a
time
when
he
could
not
command
as
many
pence
,
and
conveyed
to
the
bailiff
's
house
,
in
which
he
continued
a
whole
fortnight
,
moving
his
lodgings
higher
and
higher
,
from
time
to
time
,
in
proportion
to
the
decay
of
his
credit
;
until
,
from
the
parlour
,
he
had
made
a
regular
ascent
to
the
garret
.
<EOS>
There
while
he
ruminated
on
his
next
step
,
which
would
have
been
to
the
Marshalsea
,
and
saw
the
night
come
on
,
attended
with
hunger
and
cold
,
the
wind
began
to
blow
,
and
the
tiles
of
the
house
rattled
with
the
storm
:
his
imagination
was
immediately
struck
with
the
idea
of
escaping
unperceived
,
amidst
the
darkness
and
noise
of
the
tempest
,
by
creeping
out
at
the
window
of
his
apartment
,
and
making
his
way
over
the
tops
of
the
adjoining
houses
.
<EOS>
Glowing
with
this
prospect
,
he
examined
the
passage
,
which
,
to
his
infinite
mortification
,
he
found
grated
with
iron
-
bars
on
the
outside
;
but
even
this
difficulty
did
not
divert
him
from
his
purpose
.
<EOS>
Conscious
of
his
own
strength
,
he
believed
himself
able
to
make
an
hole
thro
'
the
roof
,
which
seemed
to
be
slender
and
crazy
;
and
,
on
this
supposition
,
he
barricadoed
the
door
with
the
whole
furniture
of
the
room
:
then
,
setting
himself
to
work
with
a
poker
,
he
in
a
few
minutes
effected
a
passage
for
his
hand
,
with
which
he
gradually
stript
off
the
boards
and
tiling
,
so
as
to
open
a
sally
-
port
for
his
whole
body
,
thro
'
which
he
fairly
set
himself
free
,
groping
his
way
towards
the
next
tenement
.
    
<EOS>
Here
,
however
,
he
met
with
an
unlucky
accident
:
his
hat
,
being
blown
off
his
head
,
chanced
to
tumble
into
the
court
,
just
as
one
of
the
bailiff
's
followers
was
knocking
at
the
door
;
and
this
myrmidon
recognizing
it
immediately
,
gave
the
alarm
to
his
chief
,
who
,
running
up
stairs
to
the
garret
,
forced
open
the
door
in
a
twinkling
,
notwithstanding
the
precautions
which
the
prisoner
had
taken
,
and
,
with
his
attendant
,
pursued
the
fugitive
thro
'
his
own
track
.
"
<EOS>
After
this
chace
had
continued
some
time
,
(
said
the
officer
)
to
the
imminent
danger
of
all
three
,
I
found
my
progress
suddenly
stopt
by
a
sky
-
light
,
through
which
I
perceived
seven
taylors
,
sitting
at
work
upon
a
board
.
<EOS>
Without
the
least
hesitation
or
previous
notice
,
I
plunged
among
them
,
with
my
backside
foremost
;
and
,
before
they
could
recollect
themselves
from
the
consternation
occasioned
by
such
a
strange
visit
,
told
them
my
situation
,
and
gave
them
to
understand
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
lost
.
<EOS>
One
of
the
number
,
taking
the
hint
,
led
me
instantly
down
stairs
,
and
dismissed
me
at
the
street
-
door
;
while
the
bailiff
and
his
follower
,
arriving
at
the
breach
,
were
deterred
from
entering
by
the
brethren
of
my
deliverer
,
who
presenting
their
shears
,
like
a
range
of
chevaux
de
frise
,
commanded
them
to
retire
,
on
pain
of
immediate
death
:
and
the
catchpole
,
rather
than
risque
his
carcase
,
consented
to
discharge
the
debt
,
comforting
himself
with
the
hope
of
making
me
prisoner
again
.
<EOS>
There
,
however
,
he
was
disappointed
:
    
I
kept
snug
,
and
laughed
at
his
escape
-
warrant
,
until
I
was
ordered
abroad
with
the
regiment
,
when
I
convey'd
myself
in
a
hearse
to
Gravesend
,
where
I
embarked
for
Flanders
;
but
,
being
obliged
to
come
over
again
on
the
recruiting
service
,
I
was
nabb'd
on
another
score
:
and
all
the
satisfaction
my
first
captor
has
been
able
to
obtain
,
is
a
writ
of
detainer
;
which
,
I
believe
,
will
fix
me
in
this
place
,
until
the
parliament
,
in
its
great
goodness
,
shall
think
proper
to
discharge
my
debts
,
by
a
new
act
of
insolvency
.
"
    
<EOS>
Every
body
owned
,
that
the
captain
's
success
was
equal
to
the
hardiness
of
his
enterprize
,
which
was
altogether
in
the
stile
of
a
soldier
:
but
one
of
the
merchants
observed
,
that
he
must
have
been
a
bailiff
of
small
experience
,
who
would
trust
a
prisoner
of
that
consequence
in
such
an
unguarded
place
.
<EOS>
"
If
the
captain
(
said
he
)
had
fallen
into
the
hands
of
such
a
cunning
rascal
as
the
fellow
that
arrested
me
,
he
would
not
have
found
it
such
an
easy
matter
to
escape
;
for
the
manner
in
which
I
was
caught
,
is
perhaps
the
most
extraordinary
that
ever
was
practised
in
these
realms
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
gentlemen
<EOS>
,
I
suffered
such
losses
by
insuring
vessels
,
during
the
war
,
that
I
was
obliged
to
stop
payment
,
tho
'
<EOS>
my
expectations
were
such
as
encouraged
me
to
manage
one
branch
of
business
,
without
coming
to
any
immediate
composition
with
my
creditors
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
I
received
consignments
from
abroad
as
usual
;
and
that
I
might
not
be
subject
to
the
visits
of
those
catchpoles
,
I
never
stirred
abroad
,
but
,
turning
my
first
floor
into
a
warehouse
,
ordered
all
my
goods
to
be
hoisted
up
by
a
crane
,
fixed
to
the
upper
story
of
my
house
.
<EOS>
Divers
were
the
stratagems
practised
by
those
ingenious
ferrets
,
with
a
view
of
decoying
me
from
the
walls
of
my
fortification
.
<EOS>
I
received
innumerable
messages
from
people
,
who
wanted
to
see
me
at
certain
taverns
,
upon
particular
business
:
I
was
summoned
into
the
country
,
to
see
my
own
mother
,
who
was
said
to
be
at
the
point
of
death
.
    
<EOS>
A
gentlewoman
,
one
night
,
was
taken
in
labour
on
my
threshold
:
at
another
time
,
I
was
disturbed
with
the
cry
of
murder
in
the
street
;
and
once
I
was
alarmed
by
a
false
fire
.
<EOS>
But
,
being
still
upon
my
guard
,
I
baffled
all
their
attempts
,
and
thought
myself
quite
secure
from
their
invention
;
when
one
of
those
blood
-
hounds
,
inspired
,
I
believe
,
by
the
devil
himself
,
contrived
a
snare
by
which
I
was
at
last
entrapped
.
<EOS>
He
made
it
his
business
to
enquire
into
the
particulars
of
my
traffick
;
and
understanding
that
,
among
other
things
,
there
were
several
chests
of
Florence
entered
at
the
custom
-
house
on
my
behalf
,
he
ordered
himself
to
be
inclosed
in
a
box
of
the
same
dimensions
,
with
air
-
holes
in
the
bottom
,
for
the
benefit
of
breathing
,
and
No%
III
/
CD
marked
/
VBN
upon
the
cover
;
and
being
conveyed
to
my
door
in
a
cart
,
among
other
goods
,
was
,
in
his
turn
,
hoisted
up
to
my
warehouse
,
where
I
stood
with
a
hammer
,
in
order
to
open
the
chests
,
that
I
might
compare
the
contents
with
the
invoice
.
<EOS>
You
may
guess
my
surprize
and
consternation
,
when
,
upon
uncovering
the
box
,
I
saw
a
bailiff
rearing
up
his
head
,
like
Lazarus
from
the
grave
,
and
heard
him
declare
that
he
had
a
writ
against
me
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
I
aimed
the
hammer
at
his
head
;
but
,
in
the
hurry
of
my
confusion
,
missed
my
mark
:
and
before
I
could
repeat
the
blow
,
he
started
up
with
great
agility
,
and
executed
his
office
in
sight
of
several
evidences
,
whom
he
had
assembled
in
the
street
for
that
purpose
;
so
that
I
could
not
possibly
disentangle
myself
from
the
toil
,
without
incurring
an
escape
-
warrant
,
from
which
I
had
no
protection
.
<EOS>
But
,
had
I
known
the
contents
of
the
chest
,
by
all
that
's
good
!
<EOS>
I
would
have
ordered
my
porter
to
raise
it
up
,
as
high
as
the
crane
would
permit
,
and
then
have
cut
the
rope
by
accident
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
"
That
expedient
,
(
said
the
knight
with
the
red
ribbon
)
would
have
discouraged
him
from
such
hazardous
adventures
for
the
future
,
and
would
have
been
an
example
in
terrorem
of
all
his
brethren
.
<EOS>
The
story
puts
me
in
mind
of
a
deliverance
achieved
by
Tom
Hackabout
,
a
very
stout
honest
fellow
,
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
,
who
had
been
so
famous
for
maiming
bailiffs
,
that
another
gentleman
having
been
ill
used
at
a
sponging
house
,
no
sooner
obtained
his
liberty
than
,
with
a
view
of
being
revenged
upon
the
landlord
,
he
,
for
five
shillings
,
bought
one
of
Tom
's
notes
,
which
sold
at
a
very
large
discount
,
and
taking
out
a
writ
upon
it
,
put
it
into
the
hands
of
the
bailiff
who
had
used
him
ill
.
<EOS>
The
catchpole
,
after
a
diligent
search
,
had
an
opportunity
of
executing
the
writ
upon
the
defendant
,
who
,
without
ceremony
,
broke
one
of
his
arms
,
fractured
his
skull
,
and
belaboured
him
in
such
a
manner
,
that
he
lay
without
sense
and
motion
on
the
spot
.
<EOS>
By
such
exploits
,
this
hero
became
so
formidable
,
that
no
single
bailiff
would
undertake
to
arrest
him
;
so
that
he
appeared
in
all
public
places
,
untouched
.
<EOS>
At
length
,
however
,
several
officers
of
the
Marshalsea
-
court
entered
into
a
confederacy
against
him
;
and
two
of
the
number
,
attended
by
three
desperate
followers
,
ventured
to
arrest
him
one
day
in
the
Strand
,
near
Hungerford
-
market
:
he
found
it
impossible
to
make
resistance
,
because
the
whole
gang
sprung
upon
him
at
once
,
like
so
many
tygers
,
and
pinioned
his
arms
so
fast
,
that
he
could
not
wag
a
finger
.
    
<EOS>
Perceiving
himself
fairly
overpowered
,
he
desired
to
be
conducted
forthwith
to
jail
,
and
was
stowed
in
a
boat
accordingly
:
<EOS>
by
that
time
they
had
reached
the
middle
of
the
river
,
he
found
means
to
overset
the
wherry
by
accident
,
and
every
man
disregarding
the
prisoner
,
consulted
his
own
safety
.
<EOS>
As
for
Hackabout
,
to
whom
that
element
was
quite
familiar
,
he
mounted
astride
upon
the
keel
of
the
boat
,
which
was
uppermost
,
and
exhorted
the
bailiffs
to
swim
for
their
lives
;
protesting
,
before
God
,
that
they
had
no
other
chance
to
be
saved
.
    
<EOS>
The
watermen
were
immediately
taken
up
by
some
of
their
own
friends
,
who
,
far
from
yielding
any
assistance
to
the
catch
-
poles
,
kept
aloof
,
and
exulted
in
their
calamity
.
<EOS>
In
short
,
two
of
the
five
went
to
the
bottom
,
and
never
saw
the
light
of
God
's
sun
,
and
the
other
three
,
with
great
difficulty
,
saved
themselves
by
laying
hold
on
the
rudder
of
a
dung
-
barge
,
to
which
they
were
carried
by
the
stream
,
while
Tom
,
with
great
deliberation
,
swam
across
to
the
Surry
shore
.
<EOS>
After
this
atchievement
,
he
was
so
much
dreaded
by
the
whole
fraternity
,
that
they
shivered
at
the
very
mention
of
his
name
;
and
this
character
,
which
some
people
would
think
an
advantage
to
a
man
in
debt
,
was
the
greatest
misfortune
that
could
possibly
happen
to
him
;
because
no
tradesman
would
give
him
credit
for
the
least
trifle
,
on
this
supposition
,
that
he
could
not
indemnify
himself
in
the
common
course
of
law
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
parson
did
not
approve
of
Mr
Hackabout
's
method
of
escaping
,
which
he
considered
as
a
very
unchristian
attempt
upon
the
lives
of
his
fellow
-
subjects
:
    
<EOS>
"
It
is
enough
(
said
he
)
that
we
elude
the
laws
of
our
country
,
without
murthering
the
officers
of
justice
:
for
my
own
part
,
I
can
lay
my
hand
upon
my
heart
,
and
safely
say
,
that
I
forgive
from
my
soul
the
fellow
by
whom
I
was
made
prisoner
,
although
the
circumstances
of
his
behaviour
were
treacherous
,
wicked
and
profane
.
<EOS>
You
must
know
,
Mr
Pickle
,
I
was
one
day
called
into
my
chapel
,
in
order
to
join
a
couple
in
the
holy
bands
of
matrimony
:
and
my
affairs
being
at
that
time
<EOS>
so
situated
,
as
to
lay
me
under
apprehensions
of
an
arrest
,
I
cautiously
surveyed
the
man
through
a
lettice
which
was
made
for
that
purpose
,
before
I
would
venture
to
come
within
his
reach
.
<EOS>
He
was
cloathed
in
a
seaman
's
jacket
and
troussers
,
and
had
such
an
air
of
simplicity
in
his
countenance
,
as
divested
me
of
all
suspicion
:
I
,
therefore
,
without
further
scruple
,
trusted
myself
in
his
presence
,
began
to
exercise
the
duty
of
my
function
,
and
had
actually
performed
one
half
of
the
ceremony
,
when
the
supposed
woman
,
pulling
out
a
paper
from
her
bosom
,
exclaimed
with
a
masculine
voice
,
"
Sir
,
you
are
my
prisoner
,
I
have
got
a
writ
against
you
for
five
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
"
I
was
thunderstruck
at
this
declaration
,
not
so
much
on
account
of
my
own
misfortune
,
which
(
thank
heaven
!
)
<EOS>
I
can
bear
with
patience
and
resignation
,
as
at
the
impiety
of
the
wretch
,
firstly
,
in
disguising
such
a
worldly
aim
,
under
the
cloak
of
religion
;
and
,
secondly
,
in
prostituting
the
service
,
when
there
was
no
occasion
for
so
doing
,
his
design
having
previously
taken
effect
.
<EOS>
Yet
I
forgive
him
,
poor
soul
!
<EOS>
because
he
knew
not
what
he
did
;
and
I
hope
you
,
Sir
Sipple
,
will
exert
the
same
christian
virtue
towards
the
man
by
whom
you
was
likewise
over
-
reached
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
O
!
<EOS>
damn
the
rascal
,
(
cried
the
knight
)
were
I
his
judge
,
he
should
be
condemned
to
flames
everlasting
.
    
<EOS>
A
villain
!
<EOS>
to
disgrace
me
in
such
a
manner
,
before
almost
all
the
fashionable
company
in
town
.
<EOS>
"
Our
hero
expressing
a
curiosity
to
know
the
particulars
of
this
adventure
,
the
knight
gratified
his
desire
,
by
telling
him
,
that
one
evening
,
while
he
was
engaged
in
a
partie
of
cards
,
at
a
drum
in
the
house
of
a
certain
lady
of
quality
,
he
was
given
to
understand
by
one
of
the
servants
,
that
a
stranger
,
very
richly
dressed
,
was
just
arrived
in
a
chair
,
preceded
by
five
footmen
with
flambeaus
,
and
that
he
refused
to
come
up
stairs
,
until
he
should
be
introduced
by
Sir
Sipple
.
<EOS>
"
Upon
this
notice
(
continued
the
knight
)
I
judged
it
was
some
of
my
quality
-
friends
;
and
having
obtained
her
ladyship
's
permission
to
bring
him
up
,
went
down
to
the
hall
,
and
perceived
a
person
,
whom
,
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
,
I
had
never
seen
before
.
<EOS>
However
,
his
appearance
was
so
magnificent
,
that
I
could
not
harbour
the
least
suspicion
of
his
true
quality
;
and
seeing
me
advance
,
he
saluted
me
with
a
very
genteel
bow
,
observing
,
that
though
he
had
not
the
honour
of
my
acquaintance
,
he
could
not
dispense
with
waiting
upon
me
,
even
on
that
occasion
,
in
consequence
of
a
letter
which
he
had
received
from
a
particular
friend
.
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
put
a
paper
into
my
hand
,
intimating
,
that
he
had
got
a
writ
against
me
for
ten
thousand
pounds
,
and
that
it
would
be
my
interest
to
submit
without
resistance
;
for
he
was
provided
with
a
guard
of
twenty
men
,
who
surrounded
the
door
in
different
disguises
,
determined
to
secure
me
against
all
opposition
.
<EOS>
Enraged
at
the
scoundrel
's
finesse
,
and
trusting
to
the
assistance
of
the
real
footmen
assembled
in
the
hall
,
"
So
,
you
are
a
rascally
bailiff
,
(
said
I
)
who
have
assumed
the
garb
of
a
gentleman
,
in
order
to
disturb
her
ladyship
's
company
.
    
<EOS>
Take
this
fellow
,
my
lads
,
and
roll
him
in
the
kennel
:
here
are
ten
guineas
for
your
trouble
.
<EOS>
"
These
words
were
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
I
was
seized
,
lifted
up
,
placed
in
a
chair
,
and
carried
off
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
:
<EOS>
not
but
that
the
servants
of
the
house
,
and
some
other
footmen
,
made
a
motion
towards
my
rescue
,
and
alarmed
all
the
company
above
:
but
the
bailiff
affirming
with
undaunted
effrontery
,
that
I
was
taken
up
upon
an
affair
of
state
,
and
so
many
people
appearing
in
his
behalf
,
the
countess
would
not
suffer
the
supposed
messenger
to
be
insulted
;
and
he
carried
me
to
the
county
-
jail
,
without
further
lett
or
molestation
.

Chapter
CVI
   
<EOS>
The
knight
had
scarce
finished
this
narrative
,
when
our
hero
was
told
,
that
a
gentleman
in
the
coffee
-
room
wanted
to
see
him
;
and
when
he
went
thither
,
he
found
his
friend
Crabtree
,
who
had
transacted
all
his
affairs
,
according
to
the
determination
of
the
preceding
day
;
and
now
gave
him
an
account
of
the
remarks
he
had
over
-
heard
on
the
subject
of
his
misfortune
:
for
the
manner
of
the
arrest
was
so
public
and
extraordinary
,
that
those
who
were
present
,
immediately
propagated
it
among
their
acquaintance
;
and
it
was
that
same
evening
discoursed
upon
at
several
tea
and
card
-
tables
,
with
this
variation
from
the
truth
,
that
the
debt
amounted
to
twelve
thousand
,
instead
of
twelve
hundred
pounds
:
from
which
circumstance
it
was
conjectured
,
that
Peregrine
was
a
bite
from
the
beginning
,
who
had
found
credit
on
account
of
his
effrontery
and
appearance
,
and
imposed
himself
upon
the
town
as
a
young
gentleman
of
fortune
.
<EOS>
They
rejoiced
,
therefore
,
at
his
calamity
,
which
they
considered
as
a
just
punishment
for
his
fraud
and
presumption
,
and
began
to
review
certain
particulars
of
his
conduct
,
that
plainly
demonstrated
him
to
be
a
rank
adventurer
,
long
before
he
had
arrived
at
this
end
of
his
career
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
who
now
believed
his
glory
was
set
for
ever
,
received
this
intelligence
with
that
disdain
which
enables
a
man
to
detach
himself
effectually
from
the
world
,
and
,
with
great
tranquillity
,
gave
the
Misanthrope
an
entertaining
detail
of
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
since
their
last
parting
.
<EOS>
While
they
amused
themselves
in
this
manner
over
a
dish
of
coffee
,
they
were
joined
by
the
parson
,
who
congratulated
our
hero
upon
his
bearing
mischance
with
such
philosophic
quiet
,
and
began
to
regale
the
two
friends
with
some
curious
circumstances
relating
to
the
private
history
of
the
several
prisoners
,
as
they
happened
to
come
in
.
    
<EOS>
At
length
a
gentleman
entered
,
at
sight
of
whom
the
clergyman
rose
up
,
and
saluted
him
with
a
most
reverential
bow
,
which
was
graciously
returned
by
the
stranger
,
who
,
with
a
young
man
that
attended
him
,
retired
,
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
.
<EOS>
They
were
no
sooner
out
of
hearing
,
than
the
communicative
priest
desired
his
company
to
take
particular
notice
of
this
person
to
whom
he
had
paid
his
respects
:
    
"
That
man
(
said
he
)
is
this
day
one
of
the
most
flagrant
instances
of
neglected
virtue
which
the
world
can
produce
.
<EOS>
Over
and
above
a
cool
,
discerning
head
,
fraught
with
uncommon
learning
and
experience
,
he
is
possessed
of
such
fortitude
and
resolution
,
as
no
difficulties
can
discourage
,
and
no
danger
impair
;
and
so
indefatigable
is
his
humanity
,
that
even
now
,
while
he
is
surrounded
with
such
embarassments
,
as
would
distract
the
brain
of
any
ordinary
mortal
,
he
has
added
considerably
to
his
incumbrances
,
by
taking
under
his
protection
that
young
gentleman
,
who
,
induced
by
his
character
,
appealed
to
his
benevolence
for
redress
of
the
grievances
under
which
he
labours
from
the
villainy
of
his
guardian
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
's
curiosity
being
excited
by
this
encomium
<EOS>
,
he
asked
the
name
of
this
generous
patron
,
of
which
when
he
was
informed
,
"
I
am
no
stranger
(
said
he
)
to
the
fame
of
that
gentleman
,
who
has
made
a
considerable
noise
in
the
world
,
on
account
of
<EOS>
that
great
cause
he
undertook
in
defence
of
an
unhappy
orphan
;
and
since
he
is
a
person
of
such
an
amiable
disposition
,
I
am
heartily
sorry
to
find
that
his
endeavours
have
not
met
with
that
successful
issue
which
their
good
fortune
in
the
beginning
seemed
to
promise
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
circumstance
of
his
espousing
that
cause
was
so
uncommon
and
romantic
,
and
the
depravity
of
the
human
heart
so
universal
,
that
some
people
,
unacquainted
with
his
real
character
,
imagined
his
views
were
altogether
selfish
;
and
some
were
not
wanting
,
who
affirmed
he
was
a
mere
adventurer
.
    
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
must
do
him
the
justice
to
own
,
I
have
heard
some
of
the
most
virulent
of
those
who
were
concerned
on
the
other
side
of
the
question
,
bear
testimony
in
his
favour
,
observing
,
that
he
was
deceived
into
the
expence
of
the
whole
,
by
the
plausible
story
which
at
first
engaged
his
compassion
.
<EOS>
Your
description
of
his
character
confirms
me
in
the
same
opinion
;
though
I
am
quite
ignorant
of
the
affair
,
the
particulars
of
which
I
should
be
glad
to
learn
,
as
well
as
a
genuine
account
of
his
own
life
,
many
circumstances
of
which
are
by
his
enemies
,
I
believe
,
egregiously
misrepresented
.
"
    
<EOS>
"
Sir
,
(
answered
the
priest
)
that
is
a
piece
of
satisfaction
which
I
am
glad
to
find
myself
capable
of
giving
you
:
I
have
had
the
pleasure
of
being
acquainted
with
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
from
his
youth
,
and
every
thing
which
I
shall
relate
concerning
him
,
you
may
depend
upon
as
a
fact
which
hath
fallen
under
my
own
cognizance
,
or
been
vouched
upon
the
credit
of
undoubted
evidence
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
's
father
was
a
minister
of
the
established
church
of
Scotland
,
descended
from
a
very
ancient
clan
,
and
his
mother
nearly
related
to
a
noble
family
in
the
northern
part
of
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
While
the
son
was
boarded
at
a
public
school
,
where
he
made
good
progress
in
the
Latin
tongue
,
his
father
died
,
and
he
was
left
an
orphan
to
the
care
of
an
uncle
,
who
,
finding
him
determined
against
any
servile
employment
,
kept
him
at
school
,
that
he
might
prepare
himself
for
the
university
,
with
a
view
of
being
qualified
for
his
father
's
profession
.
    
<EOS>
Here
his
imagination
was
so
heated
by
the
warlike
atchievements
he
found
recorded
in
the
Latin
authors
,
such
as
Caesar
,
Curtius
and
Buchanan
,
that
he
was
seized
with
an
irresistible
thirst
of
military
glory
,
and
desire
of
trying
his
fortune
in
the
army
;
and
his
majesty
's
troops
taking
the
field
,
in
consequence
of
the
rebellion
which
happened
in
the
year
seventeen
hundred
and
fifteen
,
this
young
adventurer
,
thinking
no
life
equal
to
that
of
a
soldier
,
found
means
to
furnish
himself
with
a
fusil
and
bayonet
,
and
leaving
the
school
,
repaired
to
the
camp
near
Stirling
,
with
a
view
of
signalizing
himself
in
the
field
,
though
he
was
at
that
time
but
just
turned
of
thirteen
.
<EOS>
He
offered
his
service
to
several
officers
,
in
hope
of
being
inlisted
in
their
companies
;
but
they
would
not
receive
him
,
because
they
rightly
concluded
that
he
was
some
school
-
boy
broke
loose
,
without
the
knowledge
or
consent
of
his
relations
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
discouragement
,
he
continued
in
camp
,
curiously
prying
into
every
part
of
the
service
;
and
such
was
the
resolution
conspicuous
in
him
,
even
at
such
a
tender
age
,
that
after
his
small
finances
were
exhausted
,
he
persisted
in
his
design
;
and
,
because
he
would
not
make
his
wants
known
,
actually
subsisted
for
several
days
on
hips
,
haws
and
sloes
,
and
other
spontaneous
fruits
which
he
gathered
in
the
woods
and
fields
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
never
failed
to
be
present
,
when
any
regiment
,
or
corps
of
men
,
were
drawn
out
to
be
exercised
and
reviewed
,
and
accompanied
them
in
all
their
evolutions
,
which
he
had
learned
to
great
perfection
,
by
observing
the
companies
which
were
quartered
in
the
place
where
he
was
at
school
.
    
<EOS>
This
eagerness
and
perseverance
attracted
the
notice
of
many
officers
,
who
after
having
commended
his
spirit
and
zeal
,
pressed
him
to
return
to
his
parents
,
and
even
threatened
to
expel
him
from
the
camp
,
if
he
would
not
comply
with
their
advice
.
    
<EOS>
These
remonstrances
having
no
other
effect
than
that
of
warning
him
to
avoid
his
monitors
,
they
thought
proper
to
alter
their
behaviour
towards
him
,
took
him
into
their
protection
,
and
even
into
their
mess
;
and
what
above
all
other
marks
of
favour
,
pleased
the
young
soldier
most
,
permitted
him
to
incorporate
in
the
battalion
,
and
take
his
turn
of
duty
with
the
other
men
.
<EOS>
In
this
happy
situation
he
was
discovered
by
a
relation
of
his
mother
,
who
was
a
captain
in
the
army
,
and
who
used
all
his
authority
and
influence
in
persuading
M
#
#
#
#
to
return
to
school
,
but
finding
him
deaf
to
his
admonitions
and
threats
,
he
took
him
under
his
own
care
,
and
when
the
army
marched
to
Dumblane
,
left
him
at
Stirling
,
with
express
injunction
to
keep
himself
within
the
walls
.
    
<EOS>
He
temporized
with
his
kinsman
,
fearing
that
should
he
seem
refractory
,
the
captain
would
have
ordered
him
to
be
shut
up
in
the
castle
;
and
inflamed
with
the
desire
of
seeing
a
battle
,
no
sooner
saw
his
relation
marched
off
the
ground
,
than
he
mixed
in
with
another
regiment
,
to
which
his
former
patrons
belonged
,
and
proceeded
to
the
field
,
where
he
distinguished
himself
,
even
at
that
early
time
of
life
,
by
his
gallantry
,
in
helping
to
retrieve
a
pair
of
colours
belonging
to
M####n
's
regiment
;
so
that
after
the
affair
,
he
was
presented
to
the
duke
of
Argyle
,
and
recommended
strongly
to
brigadier
Grant
,
who
invited
him
into
his
regiment
,
and
promised
to
provide
for
him
with
the
first
opportunity
:
    
But
that
gentleman
in
a
little
time
lost
his
command
upon
the
duke
's
disgrace
,
and
the
regiment
was
ordered
for
Ireland
,
being
given
to
colonel
Nassau
,
whose
favour
,
the
young
volunteer
acquired
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
was
recommended
to
the
king
for
an
ensigncy
,
which
in
all
probability
he
would
have
obtained
,
had
not
the
regiment
been
unluckily
reduced
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
reduction
,
which
happened
in
the
most
severe
season
of
the
year
,
he
was
obliged
to
return
to
his
own
country
,
thro
'
infinite
hardships
,
to
which
he
was
exposed
from
the
narrowness
of
his
circumstances
;
and
continuing
still
enamoured
of
a
military
life
,
he
entered
into
the
regiment
of
Scotch
greys
,
at
that
time
commanded
by
the
late
Sir
James
Campbell
,
who
being
acquainted
with
his
family
and
character
,
encouraged
him
with
the
promise
of
speedy
preferment
.
<EOS>
In
this
corps
he
remained
three
years
,
during
which
,
he
had
no
opportunity
of
seeing
actual
service
,
except
at
the
affair
of
Glensheel
;
and
this
life
of
insipid
quiet
,
must
have
hung
heavy
upon
a
youth
of
M
#
#
#
#
's
active
disposition
,
had
not
he
found
exercise
for
the
mind
,
in'reading
books
of
amusement
,
history
,
voyages
,
and
geography
,
together
with
those
that
treated
of
the
art
of
war
ancient
and
modern
,
for
which
he
contracted
such
an
eager
appetite
,
that
he
used
to
spend
sixteen
hours
a
day
in
this
employment
.
<EOS>
About
that
time
,
he
became
acquainted
with
a
gentleman
of
learning
and
taste
,
who
observing
his
indefatigable
application
,
and
insatiable
thirst
after
knowledge
,
took
upon
himself
the
charge
of
superintending
his
studies
;
and
by
the
direction
of
such
an
able
guide
,
the
young
soldier
converted
his
attention
to
a
more
solid
and
profitable
course
of
reading
.
    
<EOS>
So
inordinate
was
his
desire
of
making
speedy
advances
in
the
paths
of
learning
,
that
within
the
compass
of
three
months
,
he
diligently
perused
the
writings
of
Lock
,
and
Malbranche
,
and
made
himself
master
of
the
first
six
,
and
of
the
eleventh
and
twelfth
books
of
Euclid
's
elements
.
<EOS>
He
considered
Puffendorf
and
Grotius
with
uncommon
care
,
acquired
a
tolerable
degree
of
knowledge
in
the
French
language
,
and
his
imagination
was
so
captivated
with
the
desire
of
learning
,
that
seeing
no
prospect
of
a
war
,
or
views
of
being
provided
for
in
the
service
,
he
quitted
the
army
,
and
went
through
a
regular
course
of
university
education
.
<EOS>
Having
made
such
progress
in
his
studies
,
he
resolved
to
qualify
himself
for
the
church
,
and
acquired
such
a
stock
of
school
divinity
under
the
instructions
of
a
learned
professor
at
Edinburgh
,
that
he
more
than
once
mounted
the
rostrum
,
in
the
public
hall
,
and
held
forth
with
uncommon
applause
:
But
being
discouraged
from
a
prosecution
of
his
plan
,
by
the
unreasonable
austerity
of
some
of
the
Scotch
clergy
,
by
whom
,
the
most
indifferent
and
innocent
words
and
actions
,
were
often
misconstrued
into
levity
and
misconduct
;
he
resolved
to
embrace
the
first
favourable
opportunity
of
going
abroad
,
being
enflamed
with
the
desire
of
seeing
foreign
countries
,
and
actually
set
out
for
Holland
,
where
for
the
space
of
two
years
,
he
studied
the
Roman
law
,
with
the
law
of
nature
and
nations
,
under
the
famous
professors
Tolieu
and
Barbyrac
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
finished
his
school
education
,
he
set
out
for
Paris
,
with
a
view
to
make
himself
perfect
in
the
French
language
,
and
learn
such
useful
exercises
,
as
might
be
acquired
with
the
wretched
remnant
of
his
slender
estate
,
which
was
by
that
time
reduced
very
low
.
<EOS>
In
his
journey
through
the
Netherlands
,
he
went
to
Namure
,
and
paid
his
respects
to
bishop
Strickland
and
general
Collier
,
by
whom
we
was
received
with
great
civility
,
in
consequence
of
letters
of
recommendation
,
with
which
he
was
provided
from
the
Hague
,
and
the
old
general
assured
him
of
his
protection
and
interest
for
a
pair
of
colours
,
if
he
was
disposed
to
enter
into
the
Dutch
Service
.
    
<EOS>
Tho
'
<EOS>
he
was
by
that
time
,
pretty
well
cured
of
his
military
Don
Quixotism
<EOS>
,
he
would
not
totally
decline
the
generous
proffer
,
for
which
he
thanked
him
in
the
most
grateful
terms
,
telling
the
general
that
he
would
pay
his
duty
to
him
on
his
return
from
France
,
and
then
,
if
he
could
determine
upon
returning
to
the
army
,
should
think
himself
highly
honoured
in
being
under
his
command
.
    
<EOS>
After
a
stay
of
two
months
in
Flanders
,
he
proceeded
to
Paris
,
and
far
from
taking
up
his
habitation
in
the
suburbs
of
St
Germain
,
according
to
the
custom
of
English
travellers
,
he
hired
a
private
lodging
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
,
and
associated
chiefly
with
French
officers
,
who
(
their
youthful
sallies
being
over
)
are
allowed
to
be
the
politest
gentlemen
of
that
kingdom
.
<EOS>
In
this
scheme
he
found
his
account
so
much
,
that
he
could
not
but
wonder
at
the
folly
of
his
countrymen
,
who
lose
the
main
scope
of
their
going
abroad
,
by
spending
their
time
and
fortune
idly
with
one
another
.
    
<EOS>
During
his
residence
in
Holland
,
he
had
made
himself
acquainted
with
the
best
authors
in
the
French
language
,
so
that
he
was
able
to
share
in
their
conversation
;
a
circumstance
from
which
he
found
great
benefit
;
for
,
it
not
only
improved
him
in
his
knowledge
of
that
tongue
,
but
also
tended
to
the
enlargement
of
his
acquaintance
,
in
the
course
of
which
,
he
contracted
intimacies
in
some
families
of
good
fashion
,
especially
those
of
the
long
robe
,
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
pass
his
time
very
agreeably
,
had
he
been
a
little
easier
in
point
of
fortune
:
but
his
finances
,
notwithstanding
the
most
rigid
oeconomy
,
being
,
in
a
few
months
,
reduced
to
a
very
low
ebb
,
the
prospect
of
indigence
threw
a
damp
upon
all
his
pleasures
<EOS>
,
tho
'
he
never
suffered
himself
to
be
thereby
,
in
any
degree
,
dispirited
;
being
in
that
respect
,
of
so
happy
<EOS>
a
disposition
,
that
conscious
poverty
or
abundance
made
very
slight
impressions
upon
his
mind
.
    
<EOS>
This
consumption
of
his
cash
,
however
,
involved
him
in
some
perplexity
;
and
he
deliberated
with
himself
whether
he
should
return
to
general
Collier
,
or
repair
to
London
,
where
he
might
possibly
fall
into
some
business
not
unbecoming
a
gentleman
;
tho
'
he
was
very
much
mortified
to
find
himself
incapable
of
gratifying
an
inordinate
desire
which
possessed
him
of
making
the
grand
tour
,
or
at
least
,
of
visiting
the
southern
parts
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
thus
hesitated
between
different
suggestions
,
he
was
one
morning
,
visited
by
a
gentleman
who
had
sought
and
cultivated
his
friendship
,
and
for
whom
he
had
done
a
good
office
,
in
supporting
him
with
spirit
,
against
a
brutal
German
,
with
whom
he
had
an
affair
of
honour
.
    
<EOS>
This
gentleman
came
to
propose
a
party
for
a
fortnight
,
to
Fontainbleau
,
where
the
court
then
was
;
and
the
proposal
being
declined
by
M
#
#
#
#
with
more
than
usual
stiffness
,
his
friend
was
very
urgent
to
know
the
reason
of
his
refusal
,
and
at
length
,
with
some
confusion
,
said
,
"
Perhaps
your
finances
are
low
.
"
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
replied
,
that
he
had
wherewithal
to
defray
the
expence
of
his
journey
to
London
,
where
he
could
be
furnished
with
a
fresh
supply
;
and
this
answer
was
no
sooner
made
,
than
the
other
taking
him
by
the
hand
,
"
<EOS>
My
dear
friend
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
am
not
unacquainted
with
your
affairs
,
and
would
have
offered
you
my
credit
long
ago
,
<EOS>
if
I
had
thought
it
would
be
acceptable
;
even
now
,
I
do
not
pretend
to
give
you
money
,
but
desire
and
insist
upon
it
,
that
you
will
accept
of
the
loan
of
these
two
pieces
of
paper
,
to
be
repayed
when
you
marry
a
woman
with
a
fortune
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
or
obtain
an
employment
of
a
thousand
a
year
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
he
presented
him
with
two
actions
of
above
two
thousand
livres
each
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
was
astonished
at
this
unexpected
instance
of
generosity
in
a
stranger
,
and
with
suitable
acknowledgment
,
peremptorily
refused
to
incur
such
an
obligation
;
but
at
length
,
he
was
,
by
dint
of
importunity
,
and
warm
expostulation
prevailed
upon
to
accept
one
of
the
actions
,
on
condition
that
the
gentleman
would
take
his
note
for
the
sum
;
and
this
he
absolutely
rejected
,
until
M
#
#
#
#
promised
to
draw
upon
him
for
double
the
value
,
or
more
,
in
case
he
should
at
any
time
want
a
further
supply
.
<EOS>
This
uncommon
act
of
friendship
and
generosity
,
M
#
#
#
#
afterwards
had
an
opportunity
to
repay
ten
-
fold
,
tho
'
he
could
not
help
regretting
the
occasion
,
on
his
friend
's
account
.
    
<EOS>
That
worthy
man
having
,
by
placing
too
much
confidence
in
a
villanous
lawyer
,
and
a
chain
of
other
misfortunes
,
involved
himself
and
his
amiable
lady
in
a
labyrinth
of
difficulties
,
which
threatened
the
total
ruin
of
his
family
;
M
#
#
#
#
felt
the
inexpressible
satisfaction
of
delivering
his
benefactor
from
the
snare
.
    
<EOS>
Being
thus
reinforced
by
the
generosity
of
his
friend
,
M
#
#
#
#
resolved
to
execute
his
former
plan
of
seeing
the
south
of
France
,
together
with
the
seaports
of
Spain
,
as
far
as
Cadiz
,
<EOS>
from
whence
he
proposed
to
take
a
passage
for
London
by
sea
,
and
with
this
view
,
sent
forwards
his
trunks
by
the
diligence
to
Lyons
,
determined
to
ride
post
,
in
order
to
enjoy
a
better
view
of
the
country
,
and
for
the
conveniency
of
stopping
at
those
places
where
there
was
any
thing
remarkable
to
be
seen
or
enquired
into
.
<EOS>
While
he
was
employed
in
taking
leave
of
his
Parisian
friends
,
who
furnished
him
with
abundant
recommendation
,
a
gentleman
of
his
own
country
,
who
spoke
little
or
no
French
,
hearing
of
his
intention
,
begged
the
favour
of
accompanying
him
in
his
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
new
companion
,
therefore
,
he
set
out
for
Lyons
,
where
he
was
perfectly
well
received
by
the
intendant
and
some
of
the
best
families
of
the
place
,
in
consequence
of
his
letters
of
recommendation
;
and
after
a
short
stay
in
that
city
,
proceeded
down
the
Rhone
,
to
Avignon
,
in
what
is
called
the
coche
d'eau
;
then
visiting
the
principal
towns
of
Dauphine
,
Languedoc
and
Provence
,
he
returned
to
the
delightful
city
of
Marseilles
,
where
he
and
his
fellow
traveller
were
so
much
captivated
by
the
serenity
of
the
air
,
the
good
nature
and
hospitality
of
the
sprightly
inhabitants
,
that
they
never
dreamed
of
changing
their
quarters
,
during
the
whole
winter
,
and
part
of
the
spring
:
    
<EOS>
Here
he
acquired
the
acquaintance
of
the
marquis
D'Argens
,
attorney
-
general
in
the
parliament
of
Aix
,
and
of
his
eldest
son
,
who
now
makes
so
great
a
figure
in
the
literary
world
;
and
when
the
affair
of
father
Girard
and
madamoiselle
Cadiere
began
to
make
a
noise
,
he
accompanied
these
two
gentlemen
to
Toulon
,
where
the
marquis
was
ordered
to
take
precognition
of
the
facts
.
    
<EOS>
On
his
return
to
Marseilles
,
he
found
a
certain
noble
lord
of
great
fortune
,
under
the
direction
of
a
Swiss
governor
,
who
had
accommodated
him
with
two
of
his
own
relations
,
of
the
same
country
,
by
way
of
companions
,
together
with
five
servants
in
his
train
.
<EOS>
They
being
absolute
strangers
in
the
place
,
M
#
#
#
#
introduced
them
to
the
intendant
,
and
several
other
good
families
;
and
had
the
good
fortune
to
be
so
agreeable
to
his
lordship
,
that
he
proposed
,
and
even
pressed
him
to
live
with
him
in
England
,
as
a
friend
and
companion
;
and
to
take
upon
him
the
superintendance
of
his
affairs
,
in
which
case
,
he
would
settle
upon
him
four
hundred
a
year
for
life
.
    
<EOS>
This
proposal
was
too
advantageous
to
be
slighted
by
a
person
of
no
fortune
,
or
fixed
establishment
;
he
,
therefore
,
made
no
difficulty
of
closing
with
it
:
but
as
his
lordship
's
departure
was
fixed
to
a
short
day
,
and
he
urged
him
to
accompany
him
to
Paris
,
and
from
thence
to
England
,
M
#
#
#
#
thought
it
would
be
improper
and
indecent
to
interfere
with
the
office
of
his
governor
,
who
might
take
umbrage
at
his
favour
,
and
therefore
excused
himself
from
a
compliance
with
his
lordship
's
request
,
until
his
minority
should
be
expired
,
as
he
was
within
a
few
months
of
being
of
age
.
    
<EOS>
However
,
he
repeated
his
importunities
so
earnestly
,
and
the
governor
joined
in
the
request
,
with
such
appearance
of
cordiality
,
that
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
comply
with
their
joint
desire
;
and
,
in
a
few
days
,
set
out
with
them
for
Paris
,
by
the
way
of
Lyons
.
<EOS>
But
before
they
had
been
three
days
in
this
city
,
M
#
#
#
#
perceived
a
total
change
in
the
behaviour
of
the
Swiss
and
his
two
relations
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
became
jealous
of
his
influence
with
his
lordship
;
and
he
no
sooner
made
this
discovery
,
than
he
resolved
to
withdraw
himself
from
such
a
disagreeable
participation
of
that
young
nobleman
's
favour
.
<EOS>
He
therefore
,
in
spite
of
all
his
lordship
's
intreaties
and
remonstrances
,
quitted
him
for
the
present
;
alledging
,
as
a
pretext
,
that
he
had
a
longing
desire
to
see
Switzerland
and
the
banks
of
the
Rhine
,
and
promising
to
meet
him
again
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
This
his
intention
being
made
known
to
the
governor
and
his
friends
,
their
countenances
immediately
cleared
up
,
their
courtesy
and
complaisance
returned
,
and
they
even
furnished
him
with
letters
for
Geneva
,
Lausane
,
Bern
,
and
Soleures
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
he
met
with
unusual
civilities
at
these
places
.
<EOS>
Having
made
this
tour
with
his
Scotch
friend
,
(
who
came
up
to
him
before
he
left
Lyons
)
and
visited
the
most
considerable
towns
on
both
sides
of
the
Rhine
,
and
the
courts
of
the
Electors
Palatine
,
Mentz
,
and
Cologn
,
he
arrived
in
Holland
;
and
from
thence
,
thro
'
the
Netherlands
,
repaired
to
London
,
where
he
found
my
lord
just
returned
from
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
His
lordship
received
him
with
expressions
of
uncommon
joy
,
would
not
suffer
him
to
stir
from
him
for
several
days
,
and
introduced
him
to
his
relations
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
accompanied
his
lordship
from
London
to
his
country
-
seat
,
where
he
was
indeed
treated
with
great
friendship
and
confidence
,
and
consulted
in
every
thing
;
but
the
noble
peer
never
once
made
mention
of
the
annuity
which
he
had
promised
to
settle
upon
him
;
nor
did
M
#
#
#
#
remind
him
of
it
,
because
he
conceived
<EOS>
it
was
his
affair
to
fulfil
his
engagements
of
his
own
accord
.
<EOS>
W
#
#
#
#
being
tired
of
the
manner
of
living
at
this
place
,
made
an
excursion
to
Bath
,
where
he
staid
about
a
fortnight
,
to
partake
of
the
diversions
;
and
,
upon
his
return
,
found
his
lordship
making
dispositions
for
another
journey
to
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
Surprised
at
this
sudden
resolution
,
he
endeavoured
to
dissuade
him
from
it
;
but
his
remonstrances
were
rendered
ineffectual
by
the
insinuations
of
a
foreigner
,
who
had
come
over
with
him
,
and
filled
his
imagination
with
extravagant
notions
of
pleasure
,
infinitely
superior
to
any
which
he
could
enjoy
while
he
was
in
the
trammels
,
and
under
the
restraints
of
a
governor
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
all
M
#
#
#
#
's
arguments
,
and
intreated
him
to
accompany
him
in
the
journey
:
but
this
gentleman
,
foreseeing
that
a
young
man
,
like
my
lord
,
of
strong
passions
,
and
easy
to
be
misled
,
would
,
in
all
probability
,
squander
away
great
sums
of
money
,
in
a
way
that
would
neither
do
credit
to
himself
,
or
to
those
who
were
concerned
with
him
,
resisted
all
his
solicitations
,
on
pretence
of
having
business
of
consequence
at
London
;
and
afterwards
had
reason
to
be
extremely
well
pleased
with
his
own
conduct
in
this
particular
.
    
<EOS>
Before
he
set
out
on
this
expedition
,
M
#
#
#
#
,
in
justice
to
himself
,
reminded
him
of
the
proposal
which
he
had
made
to
him
at
Marseilles
,
desiring
to
know
if
he
had
altered
his
design
in
that
particular
;
in
which
case
,
he
would
turn
his
thoughts
some
other
way
;
as
he
would
not
in
the
least
be
thought
to
intrude
or
pin
himself
upon
any
man
.
<EOS>
My
lord
protested
,
in
the
most
solemn
manner
,
that
he
still
continued
in
his
former
resolution
;
and
again
beseeching
him
to
bear
him
company
into
France
,
promised
that
every
thing
should
be
settled
to
his
satisfaction
,
upon
their
return
to
England
.
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
,
however
,
still
persisted
in
his
refusal
,
for
the
abovementioned
reasons
:
and
tho
<EOS>
'
he
never
heard
more
of
the
annuity
<EOS>
,
he
nevertheless
continued
to
serve
his
lordship
with
his
advice
and
good
offices
ever
after
;
particularly
in
directing
his
choice
to
an
alliance
with
a
lady
of
eminent
virtue
,
the
daughter
of
a
noble
lord
,
more
conspicuous
for
his
shining
parts
than
the
splendor
of
his
titles
,
(
a
circumstance
upon
which
he
always
reflected
with
particular
satisfaction
,
as
well
on
account
of
the
extraordinary
merit
of
the
lady
,
as
because
it
vested
in
her
children
a
considerable
part
of
that
great
estate
,
which
,
of
right
,
belonged
to
her
grandmother
)
and
afterwards
put
him
in
a
way
to
retrieve
his
estate
from
a
heavy
load
of
debt
he
had
contracted
.
<EOS>
When
my
lord
set
out
on
his
Paris
expedition
,
the
money
M
#
#
#
#
had
received
from
his
generous
friend
at
Paris
was
almost
reduced
to
the
last
guinea
.
<EOS>
He
had
not
yet
reaped
the
least
benefit
from
his
engagements
with
his
lordship
;
and
disdaining
to
ask
for
a
supply
from
him
,
he
knew
not
how
to
subsist
,
with
any
degree
of
credit
,
'
till
his
return
.
    
<EOS>
This
uncomfortable
prospect
was
the
more
disagreeable
to
him
,
as
,
at
that
time
of
life
,
he
was
much
inclined
to
appear
in
the
gay
world
,
had
contracted
a
taste
for
plays
,
opera
's
,
and
other
public
diversions
,
and
acquired
an
acquaintance
with
many
people
of
good
fashion
,
which
could
not
be
maintained
without
a
considerable
expence
.
<EOS>
In
this
emergency
,
he
thought
he
could
not
employ
his
idle
time
more
profitably
than
in
translating
,
from
foreign
languages
,
such
books
as
were
then
chiefly
in
vogue
;
and
upon
application
to
a
friend
,
who
was
a
man
of
letters
,
he
was
furnished
with
as
much
business
of
that
kind
as
he
could
possibly
manage
,
and
wrote
some
pamphlets
on
the
reigning
controversies
of
that
time
,
that
had
the
good
fortune
to
please
.
<EOS>
He
was
also
concerned
in
a
monthly
journal
of
literature
,
and
the
work
was
carried
on
by
the
two
friends
jointly
,
tho
'
M
#
#
#
#
did
not
at
all
appear
in
the
partnership
.
<EOS>
By
these
means
he
not
only
spent
his
mornings
in
useful
exercise
,
but
supplied
himself
with
money
for
what
the
French
call
the
menus
plaisirs
,
during
the
whole
summer
.
<EOS>
He
frequented
all
the
assemblies
in
and
about
London
,
and
considerably
enlarged
his
acquaintance
among
the
fair
sex
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
,
upon
his
first
arrival
in
England
,
become
acquainted
with
a
lady
at
an
assembly
not
far
from
London
;
and
tho
'
,
at
that
time
,
he
had
no
thoughts
of
extending
his
views
farther
than
the
usual
gallantry
of
the
place
,
he
met
with
such
distinguishing
marks
of
her
regard
in
the
sequel
,
and
was
so
particularly
encouraged
by
the
advice
of
another
lady
,
with
whom
he
had
been
intimate
in
France
,
and
who
was
now
of
their
parties
,
that
he
could
not
help
entertaining
hopes
of
making
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
his
agreeable
partner
,
who
was
a
young
lady
of
an
ample
fortune
,
and
great
expectations
.
    
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
cultivated
her
good
graces
with
all
the
assiduity
and
address
of
which
he
was
master
;
and
succeeded
so
well
in
his
endeavours
,
that
after
a
due
course
of
attendance
,
and
the
death
of
an
aunt
,
by
which
she
received
an
accession
of
fortune
,
to
the
amount
of
three
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
he
ventured
to
declare
his
passion
,
and
she
not
only
heard
him
with
patience
and
approbation
,
but
also
replied
in
terms
adequate
to
his
warmest
wish
.
    
<EOS>
Finding
himself
so
favourably
received
,
he
pressed
her
to
secure
his
happiness
by
marriage
;
but
,
to
this
proposal
,
she
objected
the
recency
of
her
kinswoman
's
death
,
which
would
have
rendered
such
a
step
highly
indecent
,
and
the
displeasure
of
her
other
relations
,
from
whom
she
had
still
greater
expectations
,
and
who
at
that
time
importuned
her
to
marry
a
cousin
of
her
own
,
whom
she
could
not
like
.
<EOS>
However
,
that
M
#
#
#
#
might
have
no
cause
to
repine
at
her
delay
,
she
freely
entered
with
him
into
an
intimacy
of
correspondence
;
during
which
,
nothing
could
have
added
to
their
mutual
felicity
,
which
was
the
more
poignant
and
refined
,
from
the
mysterious
and
romantic
manner
of
their
enjoying
it
;
for
,
tho
'
he
publickly
visited
her
as
an
acquaintance
,
<EOS>
his
behaviour
,
on
these
occasions
,
was
always
so
distant
,
respectful
,
and
reserved
,
that
the
rest
of
the
company
could
not
possibly
suspect
the
nature
of
their
reciprocal
attachment
:
in
consequence
of
which
,
they
used
to
have
private
interviews
,
unknown
to
every
soul
upon
earth
,
except
her
maid
,
who
was
necessarily
intrusted
with
the
secret
.
    
<EOS>
In
this
manner
they
enjoyed
the
conversation
of
each
other
for
above
twelve
months
,
without
the
least
interruption
;
and
tho
'
the
stability
of
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
's
fortune
intirely
depended
upon
their
marriage
,
yet
as
he
perceived
his
mistress
so
averse
to
it
,
he
never
urged
it
with
vehemence
,
nor
was
at
all
anxious
on
that
score
;
being
easily
induced
to
defer
a
ceremony
which
,
as
he
then
thought
,
could
in
no
shape
have
added
to
their
satisfaction
,
tho
'
he
hath
since
altered
his
sentiments
.
    
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
will
,
his
indulgent
mistress
,
in
order
to
set
his
mind
at
ease
in
that
particular
,
and
in
full
confidence
of
his
honour
,
insisted
on
his
accepting
a
deed
of
gift
of
her
whole
fortune
,
in
consideration
of
their
intended
marriage
;
and
after
some
difficulty
,
he
was
prevailed
upon
to
receive
this
proof
of
her
esteem
,
well
knowing
that
it
would
still
be
in
his
power
to
return
the
obligation
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
she
often
intreated
him
to
take
upon
himself
the
intire
administration
of
her
finances
,
and
upon
divers
occasions
pressed
him
to
accept
of
large
sums
,
he
never
once
abused
her
generous
disposition
,
or
solicited
her
for
money
,
except
for
some
humane
purpose
,
which
she
was
always
more
ready
to
fulfil
than
he
to
propose
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
this
correspondence
,
he
became
acquainted
with
some
of
her
female
relations
;
and
,
among
the
rest
,
with
a
young
lady
,
so
eminently
adorned
with
all
the
qualifications
of
mind
and
person
,
that
,
notwithstanding
all
his
philosophy
and
caution
,
he
could
not
behold
and
converse
with
her
,
without
being
deeply
smitten
with
her
charms
.
    
<EOS>
He
did
all
in
his
power
to
discourage
this
dangerous
invasion
in
the
beginning
,
and
to
conceal
the
least
symptom
of
it
from
her
relation
:
he
summoned
all
his
reflection
to
his
aid
;
and
thinking
it
would
be
base
and
dishonest
to
cherish
any
sentiment
,
repugnant
to
the
affection
which
he
owed
to
a
mistress
,
who
had
placed
such
unlimited
confidence
in
him
<EOS>
,
he
attempted
to
stifle
the
infant
flame
by
avoiding
the
amiable
inspirer
of
it
.
<EOS>
But
the
passion
had
taken
too
deep
a
root
in
his
heart
,
to
be
so
easily
extirpated
:
his
absence
from
the
dear
object
,
increased
the
impatience
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
The
intestine
conflict
between
that
and
gratitude
,
deprived
him
of
his
rest
and
appetite
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
in
a
short
time
,
emaciated
by
continual
watching
,
anxiety
,
and
want
of
nourishment
;
and
so
much
altered
from
his
usual
chearfulness
,
that
his
mistress
being
surprised
and
alarmed
at
the
change
,
which
,
from
the
symptoms
,
she
judged
was
owing
to
some
uneasiness
of
mind
,
took
all
imaginable
pains
to
discover
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
In
all
probability
,
it
did
not
escape
her
penetration
;
for
she
,
more
than
once
,
asked
if
he
was
in
love
with
her
cousin
;
protesting
that
,
far
from
being
an
obstacle
to
his
happiness
,
she
would
,
in
that
case
,
be
an
advocate
for
his
passion
.
<EOS>
However
,
this
declaration
was
never
made
without
manifest
signs
of
anxiety
and
uneasiness
,
which
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
heart
of
M
#
#
#
#
,
that
he
resolved
to
sacrifice
his
happiness
,
and
even
his
life
,
rather
than
take
any
step
which
might
be
construed
into
an
injury
or
insult
to
a
person
who
had
treated
him
with
such
generosity
and
goodness
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
resolution
,
he
formed
another
which
was
to
go
abroad
,
under
pretence
of
recovering
his
health
,
but
in
reality
,
to
avoid
the
temptation
,
as
well
as
the
suspicion
of
being
inconstant
;
and
in
this
design
he
was
confirmed
by
his
physician
,
who
actually
thought
him
in
the
first
stage
of
a
consumption
,
and
therefore
advised
him
to
repair
to
the
south
of
France
.
    
<EOS>
He
communicated
his
design
,
with
the
doctor
's
opinion
,
to
the
lady
,
who
agreed
to
it
with
much
less
difficulty
than
he
found
in
conquering
his
own
reluctance
,
at
parting
with
the
dear
object
of
his
love
.
<EOS>
The
consent
of
his
generous
mistress
being
obtained
,
he
waited
upon
her
with
the
instrument
whereby
she
had
made
the
conveyance
of
her
fortune
to
him
;
and
all
his
remonstrances
being
insufficient
to
persuade
her
to
take
it
back
,
he
cancelled
it
in
her
presence
,
and
placed
it
in
that
state
,
upon
her
toilet
,
while
she
was
dressing
;
whereupon
she
shed
a
torrent
of
tears
,
saying
she
now
plainly
perceived
that
he
wanted
to
tear
himself
from
her
,
and
that
his
affections
were
settled
upon
another
.
<EOS>
He
was
sensibly
affected
by
this
proof
of
her
concern
;
and
endeavoured
to
calm
the
perturbation
of
her
mind
,
by
vowing
eternal
fidelity
,
and
pressing
her
to
accept
of
his
hand
in
due
form
,
before
his
departure
.
<EOS>
By
these
means
her
transports
were
quieted
for
the
present
,
and
the
marriage
deferred
,
for
the
same
prudential
reasons
which
had
hitherto
prevented
it
.
    
<EOS>
Matters
being
thus
compromised
,
and
the
day
fixed
for
his
departure
,
she
,
together
with
her
faithful
maid
,
one
morning
visited
him
for
the
first
time
at
his
own
lodgings
;
and
after
breakfast
,
desiring
to
speak
with
him
in
private
,
he
conducted
her
into
another
room
,
where
assuming
an
unusual
gravity
of
aspect
,
"
My
dear
M
#
#
#
#
(
said
she
)
<EOS>
you
are
now
going
to
leave
me
,
and
God
alone
knows
if
ever
we
shall
meet
again
:
therefore
,
if
you
really
love
me
with
that
tenderness
which
you
profess
,
you
will
accept
of
this
mark
of
my
friendship
and
unalterable
affection
:
it
will
at
least
be
a
provision
for
your
journey
;
and
if
any
accident
should
befal
me
,
before
I
have
the
happiness
of
receiving
you
again
into
my
arms
,
I
shall
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
you
are
not
altogether
without
resource
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
she
put
an
embroidered
pocket
-
book
into
his
hand
.
<EOS>
He
expressed
the
high
sense
he
had
of
her
generosity
and
affection
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
,
and
begg'd
leave
to
suspend
his
acceptance
,
until
he
should
know
the
contents
of
her
present
,
which
was
so
extraordinary
,
that
he
absolutely
refused
to
receive
it
:
he
was
,
however
,
by
her
repeated
intreaties
,
in
a
manner
compelled
to
receive
about
one
half
,
and
she
afterwards
insisted
upon
his
taking
a
reinforcement
of
a
considerable
sum
for
the
expence
of
his
journey
.
    
<EOS>
Having
stayed
with
her
ten
days
beyond
the
time
he
had
fixed
for
his
departure
,
and
settled
the
method
of
their
correspondence
,
he
took
his
leave
with
an
heart
full
of
sorrow
,
anxiety
and
distraction
,
produced
from
the
different
suggestions
of
his
duty
and
love
.
<EOS>
He
then
set
out
for
France
,
and
after
a
short
stay
at
Paris
,
proceeded
for
Aix
in
Provence
,
and
from
thence
to
Marseilles
,
at
which
two
places
he
continued
for
some
months
:
but
nothing
he
met
with
being
able
to
dissipate
those
melancholy
ideas
which
still
preyed
upon
his
imagination
,
and
affected
his
spirits
,
he
endeavoured
to
elude
them
with
a
succession
of
new
objects
;
and
with
that
view
,
persuaded
a
counsellor
of
the
parliament
of
Aix
,
a
man
of
great
worth
,
learning
and
good
humour
,
to
accompany
him
,
in
making
a
tour
of
those
parts
of
France
which
he
had
not
yet
seen
.
    
<EOS>
On
their
return
from
this
excursion
,
they
found
at
Aix
an
Italian
Abbe
,
a
person
of
character
,
and
great
knowledge
of
men
and
books
,
who
having
travelled
all
over
Germany
and
France
,
was
so
far
on
his
return
to
his
own
country
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
having
,
by
means
of
his
friend
the
counsellor
,
contracted
an
acquaintance
with
this
gentleman
,
and
being
desirous
of
seeing
some
parts
of
Italy
,
particularly
the
carnival
at
Venice
,
they
set
out
together
from
Marseilles
,
in
a
tartan
,
for
Genoa
,
coasting
it
all
the
way
,
and
lying
on
shore
every
night
.
<EOS>
Having
shewn
him
what
was
most
remarkable
in
this
city
,
his
friend
the
Abbe
was
so
obliging
,
as
to
conduct
him
thro
'
Tuscany
,
and
the
most
remarkable
cities
in
Lombardy
,
to
Venice
,
where
M
#
#
#
#
insisted
upon
defraying
the
expence
of
the
whole
tour
,
in
consideration
of
the
Abbe
's
complaisance
,
which
had
been
of
infinite
service
to
him
,
in
the
course
of
this
expedition
.
<EOS>
Having
remained
five
weeks
at
Venice
,
he
was
preparing
to
set
out
for
Rome
with
some
English
gentlemen
whom
he
had
met
by
accident
,
when
he
was
all
of
a
sudden
obliged
to
change
his
resolution
,
by
some
disagreeable
letters
which
he
received
from
London
.
<EOS>
Ye
had
,
from
his
first
departure
,
corresponded
with
his
generous
,
though
inconstant
mistress
,
with
a
religious
exactness
and
punctuality
;
nor
was
she
,
for
some
time
,
less
observant
of
the
agreement
they
had
made
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
she
,
by
degrees
,
became
so
negligent
and
cold
in
her
expression
,
and
so
slack
in
her
correspondence
,
that
he
could
not
help
observing
and
upbraiding
her
with
such
indifference
;
and
her
endeavours
to
palliate
it
were
supported
by
pretexts
so
frivolous
,
as
to
be
easily
seen
through
by
a
lover
of
very
little
discernment
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
tortured
himself
with
conjectures
about
the
cause
of
this
unexpected
change
,
he
received
such
intelligence
from
England
,
as
,
when
joined
with
what
he
himself
had
perceived
,
by
her
manner
of
writing
,
left
him
little
or
no
room
to
doubt
of
her
fickleness
and
inconstancy
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
as
he
knew
by
experience
,
that
informations
of
that
kind
are
not
to
be
intirely
relied
upon
,
he
resolved
to
be
more
certainly
apprized
;
and
for
that
end
,
departed
immediately
for
London
,
by
the
way
of
Tirol
,
Bavaria
,
Alsace
and
Paris
.
    
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
in
England
,
he
learned
with
infinite
concern
,
that
his
intelligence
had
not
been
at
all
exaggerated
;
and
his
sorrow
was
inexpressible
,
to
find
a
person
,
endowed
with
so
many
other
noble
and
amiable
qualities
seduced
into
an
indiscretion
,
that
,
of
necessity
,
must
ruin
the
whole
plan
which
had
been
concerted
between
them
for
their
mutual
happiness
.
<EOS>
She
made
several
attempts
,
by
letters
and
interviews
,
to
palliate
her
conduct
,
and
soften
him
into
a
reconciliation
;
but
his
honour
being
concerned
,
he
remained
deaf
to
all
her
intreaties
and
proposals
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
I
have
often
heard
him
say
,
that
he
could
not
help
loving
her
,
and
revering
the
memory
of
a
person
to
whose
generosity
and
goodness
he
owed
his
fortune
,
and
one
whose
foibles
were
over
balanced
by
a
thousand
good
qualities
.
<EOS>
He
often
insisted
on
a
restitution
;
but
,
far
from
complying
with
that
proposal
,
she
hath
afterwards
often
endeavoured
to
lay
him
under
yet
greater
obligations
of
the
same
kind
,
and
importuned
him
,
with
the
warmest
solicitations
,
to
renew
their
former
correspondence
,
which
he
as
often
declined
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
took
this
instance
of
the
inconstancy
of
the
sex
so
much
to
heart
,
that
he
had
almost
resolved
,
for
the
future
,
to
keep
clear
of
all
engagements
for
life
,
and
returned
to
Paris
,
in
order
to
dissipate
his
anxiety
,
where
he
hired
an
apartment
in
one
of
the
academies
in
the
exercises
<EOS>
whereof
he
took
singular
delight
.
<EOS>
During
his
residence
at
this
place
,
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
ingratiate
himself
with
a
great
general
,
a
descendant
of
one
of
the
most
ancient
and
illustrious
families
in
France
;
having
attracted
his
notice
by
some
remarks
he
had
written
on
Folard
's
Polybius
,
which
were
accidentally
shewn
to
that
great
man
by
one
of
his
aids
du
camp
,
who
was
a
particular
friend
of
M
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
The
favour
he
had
thus
acquired
,
was
strengthened
by
his
assiduities
and
attention
.
<EOS>
Upon
his
return
to
London
,
he
sent
some
of
Handel
's
newest
compositions
to
the
prince
,
who
was
particularly
fond
of
that
gentleman
's
productions
;
together
with
Clark
's
edition
of
Caesar
;
and
in
the
spring
of
the
same
year
,
before
the
French
army
took
the
field
,
he
was
honoured
with
a
most
obliging
letter
from
the
prince
,
inviting
him
to
come
over
,
if
he
wanted
to
see
the
operations
of
the
campaign
,
and
desiring
he
would
give
himself
no
trouble
about
his
equipage
.
    
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
having
still
some
remains
of
a
military
disposition
,
and
conceiving
this
to
be
a
more
favourable
opportunity
than
any
he
should
ever
meet
with
again
,
readily
embraced
the
offer
,
and
sacrificed
the
soft
delights
of
love
,
which
at
that
time
he
enjoyed
without
controul
,
to
an
eager
,
laborious
and
dangerous
curiosity
.
    
<EOS>
In
that
and
the
following
campaign
,
during
which
he
was
present
at
the
siege
of
Philipsburg
,
and
several
other
actions
,
he
enlarged
his
acquaintance
among
the
French
officers
,
especially
those
of
the
graver
sort
,
who
had
a
taste
for
books
and
literature
;
and
the
friendship
and
interest
of
those
gentlemen
were
afterwards
of
singular
service
to
him
,
tho
'
in
an
affair
altogether
foreign
from
their
profession
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
all
along
made
diligent
inquiry
into
the
trade
and
manufactures
of
the
countries
through
which
he
had
occasion
to
travel
,
more
particularly
those
of
Holland
,
England
and
France
;
and
as
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
revenue
and
farms
of
this
last
kingdom
,
he
saw
with
concern
the
great
disadvantages
under
which
our
tobacco
-
trade
(
the
most
considerable
branch
of
our
commerce
with
that
people
)
was
carried
on
;
what
inconsiderable
returns
were
made
to
the
planters
,
out
of
the
low
price
given
by
the
French
company
;
and
how
much
it
was
in
the
power
of
that
company
to
reduce
it
still
lower
.
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
had
formed
a
scheme
to
remedy
this
evil
,
so
far
as
it
related
to
national
loss
or
gain
,
by
not
permitting
the
duty
of
one
penny
in
the
pound
,
old
subsidy
,
to
be
drawn
back
,
on
tobacco
re
-
exported
.
    
<EOS>
He
demonstrated
to
the
ministry
of
that
time
,
that
so
inconsiderable
a
duty
could
not
in
the
least
diminish
the
demand
from
abroad
,
which
was
the
only
circumstance
to
be
apprehended
,
and
that
the
yearly
produce
of
that
revenue
would
amount
to
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
without
one
shilling
additional
expence
to
the
public
:
<EOS>
but
the
ministry
having
the
excise
-
scheme
then
in
contemplation
,
could
think
of
no
other
,
till
that
should
be
tried
;
and
that
project
having
miscarried
,
he
renewed
his
application
,
when
they
approved
of
his
scheme
in
every
particular
,
but
discovered
a
surprising
backwardness
to
carry
it
into
execution
.
    
<EOS>
His
expectations
in
this
quarter
being
disappointed
,
he
,
by
the
interposition
of
his
friends
,
presented
a
plan
to
the
French
company
,
in
which
he
set
forth
the
advantages
that
would
accrue
to
themselves
,
from
fixing
the
price
,
securing
that
sort
of
tobacco
which
best
suited
the
taste
of
the
public
and
their
manufacture
;
and
finally
,
proposed
to
furnish
them
with
any
quantity
,
at
the
price
which
they
paid
in
the
port
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
After
some
dispute
,
they
agreed
to
his
proposal
,
and
contracted
with
him
for
fifteen
thousand
hogsheads
a
year
,
for
which
they
obliged
themselves
to
pay
ready
money
,
on
its
arrival
in
any
one
or
more
convenient
ports
in
the
south
or
western
coasts
of
Great
Britain
,
that
he
should
please
to
fix
upon
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
M
#
#
#
#
no
sooner
obtained
this
contract
,
than
he
immediately
set
out
for
America
,
in
order
to
put
it
in
execution
;
and
,
by
way
of
companion
,
carried
with
him
a
little
French
abbe
,
a
man
of
humour
,
wit
and
learning
,
with
whom
he
had
been
long
acquainted
,
and
for
whom
he
had
done
many
good
offices
.
    
<EOS>
On
his
arrival
in
Virginia
,
which
opportunely
happened
at
a
time
when
all
the
gentlemen
were
assembled
in
the
capital
of
that
province
,
he
published
a
memorial
,
representing
the
disadvantages
under
which
their
trade
was
carried
on
,
the
true
method
of
redressing
their
own
grievances
in
that
respect
,
and
proposing
to
contract
with
them
for
the
yearly
quantity
of
fifteen
thousand
hogsheads
of
such
tobacco
as
was
fit
for
the
French
market
,
at
a
price
which
he
demonstrated
to
be
considerably
greater
than
that
which
they
had
formerly
received
.
    
<EOS>
This
remonstrance
met
with
all
the
success
and
encouragement
he
could
expect
:
the
principal
planters
seeing
their
own
interest
concerned
,
readily
assented
to
the
proposal
,
which
,
by
their
influence
,
was
also
relished
by
the
rest
;
and
the
only
difficulty
that
remained
,
related
to
the
security
for
payment
of
the
bills
on
the
arrival
of
the
tobacco
in
England
,
and
to
the
time
stipulated
for
the
continuance
of
the
contract
.
    
<EOS>
In
order
to
remove
these
objections
,
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
returned
to
Europe
,
and
found
the
French
company
of
farmers
disposed
to
agree
to
every
thing
he
desired
for
facilitating
the
execution
of
the
contract
,
and
perfectly
well
pleased
with
the
sample
which
he
had
already
sent
:
but
his
good
friend
the
abbe
,
(
whom
he
had
left
behind
him
in
America
)
by
an
unparalleled
piece
of
treachery
,
found
means
to
overturn
the
whole
project
.
<EOS>
He
secretly
wrote
a
memorial
to
the
company
,
importing
,
that
he
found
by
experience
,
M
#
#
#
#
could
afford
to
furnish
them
at
a
much
lower
price
than
that
which
they
had
agreed
to
give
;
and
that
,
by
being
in
possession
of
the
contract
for
five
years
,
as
was
intended
according
to
the
proposal
,
he
would
have
the
company
so
much
in
his
power
,
that
they
must
afterwards
submit
to
any
price
he
should
please
to
impose
;
and
that
if
they
thought
him
worthy
of
such
a
trust
,
he
would
undertake
to
furnish
them
at
an
easier
rate
,
in
conjunction
with
some
of
the
leading
men
in
Virginia
and
Maryland
,
with
whom
,
he
said
,
he
had
already
concerted
measures
for
that
purpose
.
    
<EOS>
The
company
were
so
much
alarmed
at
these
insinuations
,
that
they
declined
complying
with
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
's
demands
until
the
abbe
's
return
;
and
though
they
afterwards
used
all
their
endeavours
to
persuade
him
to
be
concerned
with
that
little
traitor
in
his
undertaking
,
(
by
which
he
might
still
have
been
a
very
considerable
gainer
)
<EOS>
he
resisted
all
their
solicitations
,
and
plainly
told
them
in
the
abbe
's
presence
,
that
he
would
never
prostitute
his
own
principles
so
far
,
as
to
enter
into
engagements
of
any
kind
with
a
person
of
his
character
,
much
less
in
a
scheme
that
had
a
manifest
tendency
to
lower
the
market
-
price
of
tobacco
in
England
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
ended
a
project
the
most
extensive
,
simple
and
easy
,
and
(
as
appeared
by
the
trial
made
)
the
best
calculated
to
raise
an
immense
fortune
,
of
any
that
was
ever
undertaken
or
planned
by
a
private
person
;
<EOS>
a
project
,
in
the
execution
of
which
,
M
#
#
#
#
had
the
good
of
the
public
,
and
the
glory
of
putting
in
a
flourishing
condition
that
valuable
branch
of
our
trade
,
(
which
gives
employment
to
two
great
provinces
,
and
above
two
hundred
sail
of
ships
)
much
more
at
heart
than
his
own
private
interest
.
<EOS>
It
was
reasonable
to
expect
,
that
a
man
,
whose
debts
M
#
#
#
#
had
paid
more
than
once
,
whom
he
had
obliged
in
many
other
respects
,
and
whom
he
had
carried
with
him
,
at
a
very
considerable
expence
,
on
this
expedition
,
merely
with
a
view
of
bettering
his
fortune
,
would
have
acted
with
common
honesty
,
if
not
with
gratitude
:
but
such
was
the
depravity
of
this
little
monster
's
heart
,
that
on
his
death
-
bed
he
left
a
considerable
fortune
to
mere
strangers
,
with
whom
he
had
little
or
no
connexion
,
without
the
least
thought
of
refunding
the
money
advanced
for
him
by
M
#
#
#
#
,
in
order
to
prevent
his
rotting
in
jail
.
    
<EOS>
When
M
#
#
#
#
had
once
obtained
a
command
of
money
,
he
,
by
his
knowledge
in
several
branches
of
trade
,
as
well
as
by
the
assistance
of
some
intelligent
friends
at
Paris
and
London
,
found
means
to
employ
it
to
very
good
purpose
;
and
had
he
been
a
man
of
that
selfish
disposition
,
which
too
much
prevails
in
the
world
,
he
might
have
been
,
at
this
day
,
master
of
a
very
ample
fortune
:
but
his
ear
was
never
deaf
to
the
voice
of
distress
,
nor
his
beneficent
heart
shut
against
the
calamities
of
his
fellow
-
creatures
.
<EOS>
He
was
even
ingenious
in
contriving
the
most
delicate
methods
of
relieving
modest
indigence
,
and
,
by
his
industrious
benevolence
,
often
anticipated
the
requests
of
misery
.
    
<EOS>
I
could
relate
a
number
of
examples
to
illustrate
my
assertions
,
in
some
of
which
you
would
perceive
the
most
disinterested
generosity
;
but
such
a
detail
would
trespass
too
much
upon
your
time
,
and
I
do
not
pretend
to
dwell
upon
every
minute
circumstance
of
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
Let
it
suffice
to
say
,
that
,
upon
the
declaration
of
war
with
Spain
,
he
gave
up
all
his
commercial
schemes
,
and
called
in
his
money
from
all
quarters
,
with
a
view
of
sitting
down
,
for
the
rest
of
his
life
,
contented
with
what
he
had
got
,
and
restraining
his
liberalities
to
what
he
could
spare
from
his
yearly
income
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
very
prudential
resolution
,
could
he
have
kept
it
:
but
,
upon
the
breaking
out
of
that
war
,
he
could
not
,
without
concern
,
see
many
gentlemen
of
merit
,
who
had
been
recommended
to
him
,
disappointed
of
commissions
,
merely
for
want
of
money
to
satisfy
the
expectations
of
the
commission
-
brokers
of
that
time
;
and
therefore
launched
out
considerable
sums
for
them
on
their
bare
notes
,
great
part
whereof
was
lost
by
the
death
of
some
in
the
unfortunate
expedition
to
the
West
-
Indies
.
    
<EOS>
He
,
at
length
,
after
many
other
actions
of
the
like
nature
,
from
motives
of
pure
humanity
,
love
of
justice
,
and
abhorrence
of
oppression
,
embarked
in
a
cause
,
every
way
the
most
important
that
ever
came
under
the
discussion
of
the
courts
of
law
in
these
kingdoms
;
whether
it
be
considered
in
relation
to
the
extraordinary
nature
of
the
case
,
or
the
immense
property
of
no
less
than
fifty
thousand
pounds
a
year
,
and
three
peerages
,
that
depended
upon
it
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
year
1740
,
the
brave
admiral
who
at
that
time
commanded
his
majesty
's
fleet
in
the
West
-
Indies
,
among
the
other
transactions
of
his
squadron
,
transmitted
to
the
duke
of
Newcastle
,
mentioned
a
young
man
,
who
,
tho
'
in
the
capacity
of
a
common
sailor
on
board
one
of
the
ships
under
his
command
,
laid
claim
to
the
estate
and
titles
of
the
earl
of
A
#
#
#
#
.
<EOS>
These
pretensions
were
no
sooner
communicated
in
the
public
papers
,
than
they
became
the
subject
of
conversation
in
all
companies
;
and
the
person
whom
they
chiefly
affected
,
being
alarmed
at
the
appearance
of
a
competitor
,
tho
'
at
such
distance
,
began
to
put
himself
in
motion
,
and
take
all
the
precautions
which
he
thought
necessary
to
defeat
the
endeavours
of
the
young
upstart
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
the
early
intelligence
he
received
of
Mr
A####y
's
making
himself
known
in
the
West
-
Indies
,
furnished
him
with
numberless
advantages
over
that
unhappy
young
gentleman
:
for
,
being
in
possession
of
a
plentiful
fortune
,
and
lord
of
many
manors
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
very
place
where
the
claimant
was
born
,
he
knew
all
the
witnesses
who
could
give
the
most
material
evidence
of
his
legitimacy
;
and
,
if
his
probity
did
not
restrain
him
,
had
,
by
his
power
and
influence
,
sufficient
opportunity
and
means
of
applying
to
the
passions
and
interests
of
the
witnesses
,
to
silence
many
,
and
gain
over
others
to
his
side
:
while
his
competitor
,
by
an
absence
of
fifteen
or
sixteen
years
from
his
native
country
,
the
want
of
education
and
friends
,
together
with
his
present
helpless
situation
,
was
rendered
absolutely
incapable
of
taking
any
step
for
his
own
advantage
.
<EOS>
And
although
his
worthy
uncle
's
conspicuous
virtue
,
and
religious
regard
for
justice
and
truth
,
might
possibly
be
an
unconquerable
restraint
to
his
taking
any
undue
advantages
;
yet
the
consciences
of
that
huge
army
of
emissaries
he
kept
in
pay
,
were
not
altogether
so
very
tender
and
scrupulous
.
<EOS>
This
much
,
however
,
may
be
said
,
without
derogation
from
,
or
impeachment
of
the
noble
earl
's
nice
virtue
and
honour
,
that
he
took
care
to
compromise
all
differences
with
the
other
branches
of
the
family
,
whose
interests
were
,
in
this
affair
,
connected
with
his
own
,
by
sharing
the
estate
with
them
,
and
also
retained
most
of
the
eminent
council
within
the
bar
of
both
kingdoms
against
this
formidable
bastard
,
before
any
suit
was
instituted
by
him
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
was
thus
entrenching
himself
against
the
attack
of
a
poor
forlorn
youth
,
at
the
distance
of
fifteen
hundred
leagues
,
continually
exposed
to
the
dangers
of
the
sea
,
the
war
,
and
an
unhealthy
climate
,
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
,
in
the
common
course
of
conversation
,
chanced
to
ask
some
questions
relating
to
this
romantic
pretender
,
of
one
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
was
at
that
time
the
present
lord
A####y
's
chief
agent
.
    
<EOS>
This
man
,
when
pressed
,
could
not
help
owning
that
the
late
lord
A####m
actually
left
a
son
,
who
had
been
spirited
away
into
America
,
soon
after
his
father
's
death
;
but
said
he
did
not
know
whether
this
was
the
same
person
.
    
<EOS>
This
information
could
not
fail
to
make
an
impression
on
the
humanity
of
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
,
who
,
being
acquainted
with
the
genius
of
the
wicked
party
who
had
possessed
themselves
of
this
unhappy
young
man
's
estate
and
honours
,
expressed
no
small
anxiety
and
apprehension
lest
they
should
take
him
off
by
some
means
or
other
;
and
,
even
then
,
seemed
disposed
to
contribute
towards
the
support
of
the
friendless
orphan
,
and
to
enquire
more
circumstantially
into
the
nature
of
his
claim
.
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
his
occasions
called
him
to
France
;
and
,
during
his
absence
,
Mr
A####y
arrived
in
London
,
in
the
month
of
October
1741
.
 
<EOS>
"
    
Here
the
clergyman
was
interrupted
by
Peregrine
,
who
said
there
was
something
so
extraordinary
,
not
to
call
it
improbable
,
in
the
account
he
had
heard
of
the
young
gentleman
's
being
sent
into
exile
,
that
he
would
look
upon
himself
as
infinitely
obliged
to
the
doctor
,
if
he
would
favour
him
with
a
true
representation
of
that
transaction
,
as
well
as
of
the
manner
in
which
he
arrived
and
was
known
at
the
island
of
Jamaica
.
    
<EOS>
The
parson
,
in
compliance
with
our
hero
's
request
,
taking
up
the
story
from
the
beginning
,
"
Mr
A####y
(
said
he
)
is
the
son
of
Arthur
late
lord
baron
of
A####m
,
by
his
wife
Mary
Sh####d
,
natural
daughter
to
John
duke
of
B
#
#
#
#
and
N####by
,
whom
he
publickly
married
on
the
21st
day
of
July
1706
,
contrary
to
the
inclination
of
his
mother
,
and
all
his
other
relations
,
particularly
Arthur
late
earl
of
A####y
,
who
bore
an
implacable
enmity
to
the
duke
her
father
,
and
,
for
that
reason
,
did
all
that
lay
in
his
power
to
traverse
the
marriage
:
but
,
finding
his
endeavours
ineffectual
,
he
was
so
much
offended
,
that
he
would
never
be
perfectly
reconciled
to
lord
A####m
,
tho
'
he
was
his
presumptive
heir
.
<EOS>
After
their
nuptials
,
they
cohabited
together
in
England
for
the
space
of
two
or
three
years
;
during
which
she
miscarried
more
than
once
:
and
he
being
a
man
of
levity
,
and
an
extravagant
disposition
,
not
only
squandered
away
all
that
he
had
received
of
his
wife
's
fortune
,
but
also
contracted
many
considerable
debts
,
which
obliged
him
to
make
a
precipitate
retreat
into
Ireland
,
leaving
his
lady
behind
him
in
the
house
with
his
mother
and
sisters
;
who
,
having
also
been
averse
to
the
match
,
had
always
looked
upon
her
with
eyes
of
disgust
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
likely
that
harmony
should
long
subsist
in
this
family
,
especially
as
lady
<EOS>
A####m
was
a
woman
of
a
lofty
spirit
,
who
could
not
tamely
bear
insults
and
ill
-
usage
from
persons
,
who
,
she
had
reason
to
believe
,
were
her
enemies
at
heart
.
    
<EOS>
Accordingly
a
misunderstanding
soon
happened
among
them
,
which
was
fomented
by
the
malice
of
one
of
her
sisters
-
in
-
law
:
<EOS>
divers
scandalous
reports
of
her
misconduct
,
to
which
the
empty
pretensions
of
a
vain
,
wretched
coxcomb
(
who
was
made
use
of
as
an
infamous
tool
for
that
purpose
)
gave
a
colourable
pretext
,
were
trumped
up
,
and
transmitted
,
with
many
false
and
aggravating
circumstances
,
to
her
husband
in
Ireland
;
who
,
being
a
giddy
,
unthinking
man
,
was
so
much
incensed
at
these
insinuations
,
that
,
in
the
first
transports
of
his
passion
,
he
sent
to
his
mother
a
power
of
attorney
,
that
she
might
sue
for
a
divorce
in
his
behalf
.
<EOS>
A
libel
was
thereupon
exhibited
,
containing
many
scandalous
allegations
,
void
of
any
real
foundation
in
truth
;
but
being
unsupported
by
any
manner
of
proof
,
it
was
at
length
dismissed
with
costs
,
after
it
had
depended
upwards
of
two
years
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
A####m
,
finding
himself
abused
by
the
misrepresentations
of
his
mother
and
sister
,
discovered
an
inclination
to
be
reconciled
to
his
lady
:
in
consequence
of
which
,
she
was
sent
over
to
Dublin
by
her
father
,
to
the
care
of
a
gentleman
in
that
city
;
in
whose
house
she
was
received
by
her
husband
,
with
all
the
demonstrations
of
love
and
esteem
.
<EOS>
From
thence
he
conducted
her
to
his
lodgings
,
and
then
to
his
country
-
house
;
where
she
had
the
misfortune
to
suffer
a
miscarriage
,
through
fear
and
resentment
of
my
lord
's
behaviour
,
which
was
often
brutal
and
indecent
.
<EOS>
From
the
country
they
removed
to
Dublin
,
about
the
latter
end
of
July
,
or
beginning
of
August
1714
;
where
they
had
not
long
continued
,
when
her
ladyship
was
known
to
be
again
with
child
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
A####m
and
his
issue
being
next
in
remainder
to
the
honours
and
estate
of
Arthur
earl
of
A####a
,
was
extremely
solicitous
to
have
a
son
;
and
,
warned
by
the
frequent
miscarriages
of
his
lady
,
resolved
to
curb
the
natural
impatience
and
rusticity
of
his
disposition
,
that
she
might
not
,
as
formerly
,
suffer
by
his
outrageous
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
cherished
her
with
uncommon
tenderness
and
care
;
and
her
pregnancy
being
pretty
far
advanced
,
conducted
her
to
his
country
-
seat
,
where
she
was
delivered
of
Mr
A####y
,
about
the
latter
end
of
April
or
beginning
of
May
;
for
none
of
the
witnesses
have
been
able
,
at
this
distance
,
with
absolute
certainty
,
to
fix
the
precise
time
of
his
birth
,
and
there
was
no
register
kept
in
the
parish
:
and
,
as
an
additional
misfortune
,
no
gentlemen
of
fashion
lived
in
that
parish
;
nor
did
those
who
lived
at
any
considerable
distance
,
care
to
cultivate
an
acquaintance
with
a
man
of
<EOS>
lord
A####m
's
strange
conduct
.
    
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
will
,
the
occasion
was
celebrated
by
his
lordship
's
tenants
and
dependants
upon
the
spot
,
and
in
the
neighbouring
town
of
New
R####ss
,
by
bonfires
,
illuminations
,
and
other
rejoicings
;
which
have
made
such
an
impression
upon
the
minds
of
the
people
,
that
,
in
the
place
where
they
happened
,
and
the
contiguous
parishes
,
several
hundred
people
have
already
declared
their
knowledge
and
remembrance
of
this
event
,
in
spite
of
the
great
power
of
the
claimant
's
adversary
in
that
quarter
,
and
the
great
pains
and
indirect
methods
taken
by
his
numberless
agents
and
emissaries
,
as
well
as
by
those
who
are
interested
with
him
,
in
the
event
of
the
suit
,
to
corrupt
and
suppress
the
evidence
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
A####m
,
after
the
birth
of
this
son
,
who
was
sent
to
nurse
in
the
neighbourhood
,
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
,
(
where
people
of
the
highest
distinction
put
their
children
out
to
nurse
into
farm
-
houses
and
cabbins
)
lived
in
harmony
with
his
lady
for
the
space
of
two
years
:
but
having
,
by
his
folly
and
extravagance
,
reduced
himself
to
great
difficulties
,
he
demanded
the
remainder
of
her
fortune
from
her
father
the
duke
of
B
#
#
#
#
,
who
absolutely
refused
to
part
with
a
shilling
,
until
a
proper
settlement
should
be
made
on
his
daughter
,
which
by
that
time
he
had
put
out
of
his
own
power
to
do
,
by
his
folly
and
extravagance
.
    
<EOS>
As
her
ladyship
,
by
her
endeavours
to
reform
the
oeconomy
of
her
house
,
had
incurred
the
displeasure
of
some
idle
,
profligate
fellows
,
who
had
fastened
themselves
upon
her
husband
,
and
helped
to
consume
his
substance
,
they
seized
this
opportunity
of
the
duke
's
refusal
;
and
,
in
order
to
be
revenged
upon
the
innocent
lady
,
persuaded
lord
A####m
,
that
the
only
means
of
extracting
money
from
his
grace
would
be
to
turn
her
away
,
on
pretence
of
infidelity
to
his
bed
,
for
which
,
they
hinted
,
<EOS>
there
was
but
too
much
foundation
.
<EOS>
At
their
suggestions
,
a
most
infamous
plan
was
projected
;
in
the
execution
of
which
,
one
P
#
#
#
#
,
a
poor
,
unbred
,
simple
,
country
booby
,
whom
they
had
decoyed
into
a
snare
,
lost
one
of
his
ears
,
and
the
injured
lady
retired
that
same
day
to
New
R####ss
,
where
she
continued
several
years
.
<EOS>
She
did
not
,
however
,
leave
the
house
,
without
struggling
hard
to
carry
her
child
along
with
her
;
but
,
far
from
enjoying
such
indulgence
,
strict
orders
were
given
,
that
the
boy
should
not
,
for
the
future
,
be
brought
within
her
sight
.
<EOS>
This
base
,
inhuman
treatment
,
instead
of
answering
the
end
proposed
,
produced
such
a
contrary
effect
,
that
the
duke
of
B
#
#
#
#
,
by
a
codicil
to
his
will
,
in
which
he
reflects
upon
lord
A####m
's
evil
temper
,
directed
his
executors
to
pay
to
his
daughter
an
annuity
of
one
hundred
pounds
,
while
her
lord
and
she
should
continue
to
live
separate
;
and
this
allowance
ceased
on
lord
A####m
's
death
.
    
<EOS>
While
she
remained
in
this
solitary
situation
,
the
child
was
universally
known
and
received
as
the
legitimate
son
and
heir
of
her
lord
,
whose
affection
for
the
boy
was
so
conspicuous
,
that
in
the
midst
of
his
own
necessities
,
he
never
failed
to
maintain
him
in
the
dress
and
equipage
of
a
young
nobleman
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
his
infancy
,
his
father
having
often
changed
his
place
of
residence
,
the
child
was
put
under
the
instruction
of
a
great
many
different
schoolmasters
,
so
that
he
was
perfectly
well
known
in
a
great
many
different
parts
of
the
kingdom
;
and
his
mother
seized
all
opportunities
(
which
were
but
rare
,
on
account
of
his
father
's
orders
to
the
contrary
)
of
seeing
,
and
giving
him
proofs
of
her
maternal
tenderness
,
until
she
set
out
for
England
,
after
having
been
long
in
a
declining
state
of
health
,
by
a
paralytical
disorder
;
upon
the
consequence
of
which
,
such
dependance
was
placed
by
her
inconsiderate
husband
,
who
was
by
this
time
reduced
to
extreme
poverty
,
that
he
actually
married
a
woman
whom
he
had
long
kept
as
a
mistress
;
and
this
creature
no
sooner
understood
that
lady
Al####m
was
departed
from
Ireland
,
than
she
openly
avowed
her
marriage
,
and
went
about
publickly
with
lord
A####m
,
visiting
his
acquaintances
in
character
of
his
wife
.
    
<EOS>
From
this
aera
may
be
dated
the
beginning
of
Mr
A####y
's
misfortunes
:
this
artful
woman
,
who
had
formerly
treated
the
child
with
an
appearance
of
fondness
,
in
order
to
ingratiate
herself
with
the
father
,
now
looking
upon
herself
as
sufficiently
established
in
the
family
,
thought
it
was
high
time
to
alter
her
behaviour
with
regard
to
the
unfortunate
boy
;
and
accordingly
,
for
obvious
reasons
,
employed
a
thousand
artifices
to
alienate
the
heart
of
this
weak
father
from
his
unhappy
offspring
:
yet
,
notwithstanding
all
her
insinuations
<EOS>
,
nature
still
maintained
her
influence
in
his
heart
;
and
though
she
often
found
means
to
irritate
him
by
artful
and
malicious
accusations
,
his
resentment
never
extended
farther
than
fatherly
correction
;
and
she
would
have
found
it
impossible
to
accomplish
his
ruin
,
had
not
her
efforts
been
reinforced
by
a
new
auxiliary
,
who
was
no
other
than
his
uncle
,
the
present
usurper
of
his
title
and
estate
;
yet
even
this
confederacy
was
over
-
awed
,
in
some
measure
,
by
the
fear
of
alarming
the
unfortunate
mother
,
till
her
distemper
increased
to
a
most
deplorable
degree
of
the
dead
palsy
,
and
the
death
of
her
father
had
reduced
her
to
a
most
forlorn
and
abject
state
of
distress
.
<EOS>
Then
they
ventured
upon
the
execution
of
their
projects
;
and
(
though
their
aims
were
widely
different
)
concurred
in
their
endeavours
to
remove
the
hapless
boy
,
as
the
common
obstacle
to
both
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
Al####m
,
who
(
as
I
have
already
observed
)
was
a
man
of
weak
intellects
,
and
utterly
void
of
any
fixed
principle
of
action
,
being
,
by
this
time
,
reduced
to
such
a
pitch
of
misery
,
that
he
was
often
obliged
to
pawn
his
wearing
-
apparel
,
in
order
to
procure
the
common
necessaries
of
life
;
and
having
no
other
fund
remaining
,
with
which
he
could
relieve
his
present
necessities
,
except
his
sale
of
the
reversion
of
the
A####a
estate
,
to
which
the
nonage
of
his
son
was
an
effectual
bar
,
he
was
advised
by
his
virtuous
brother
,
and
the
rest
of
his
counsellors
,
to
surmount
this
difficulty
,
by
secreting
his
son
,
and
spreading
a
report
of
his
death
.
<EOS>
This
honest
project
he
the
more
readily
embraced
,
because
he
knew
that
no
act
of
his
could
frustrate
the
child
's
succession
.
<EOS>
Accordingly
,
the
boy
was
removed
from
the
school
at
which
he
was
then
boarded
,
to
the
house
of
one
K####gh
,
an
agent
and
accomplice
of
the
present
earl
of
A####a
,
where
he
was
kept
for
several
months
closely
confined
;
and
in
the
mean
time
,
it
was
industriously
reported
that
he
was
dead
.
    
<EOS>
This
previous
measure
being
taken
,
lord
A####m
published
advertisements
in
the
gazettes
,
offering
reversions
of
the
A####a
estate
to
sale
;
and
emissaries
of
various
kinds
were
employed
,
to
inveigle
such
as
were
ignorant
of
the
nature
of
the
settlement
of
these
estates
,
or
strangers
to
the
affairs
of
his
family
.
<EOS>
Some
people
,
imposed
upon
by
the
report
of
the
child
's
death
,
were
drawn
in
to
purchase
,
thinking
themselves
safe
in
the
concurrence
of
his
lordship
's
brother
,
upon
presumption
that
he
was
next
in
remainder
to
the
succession
;
others
,
tempted
by
the
smallness
of
the
price
,
(
which
rarely
exceeded
half
a
year
's
purchase
,
as
appears
by
many
deeds
)
though
they
doubted
the
truth
of
the
boy
's
being
dead
,
ran
small
risques
on
the
contingency
of
his
dying
before
he
should
be
of
age
,
or
in
hope
of
his
being
prevailed
upon
to
confirm
the
grants
of
his
father
;
and
many
more
were
treating
with
him
on
the
same
notions
,
when
their
transactions
were
suddenly
interrupted
,
and
the
scheme
of
raising
more
money
,
for
the
present
,
defeated
by
the
unexpected
appearance
of
the
boy
,
who
being
naturally
sprightly
and
impatient
of
restraint
,
had
found
means
to
break
from
his
confinement
,
and
wandered
up
and
down
the
streets
of
Dublin
,
avoiding
his
father
's
house
,
and
choosing
to
encounter
all
sorts
of
distress
,
rather
than
subject
himself
again
to
the
cruelty
and
malice
of
the
woman
who
supplied
his
mother
's
place
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
debarred
his
father
's
protection
,
and
destitute
of
any
fixed
habitation
,
he
herded
with
all
the
loose
,
idle
,
and
disorderly
youths
in
Dublin
,
skulking
chiefly
about
the
college
,
several
members
and
students
of
which
,
taking
pity
on
his
misfortunes
,
supplied
him
at
different
times
with
cloaths
and
money
.
<EOS>
In
this
unsettled
and
uncomfortable
way
of
life
did
he
remain
,
from
the
year
1725
to
the
latter
end
of
November
1727
;
at
which
time
his
father
died
so
miserably
poor
,
that
he
was
actually
buried
at
the
public
expence
.
    
<EOS>
This
unfortunate
nobleman
was
no
sooner
dead
,
than
his
brother
Richard
,
<EOS>
now
earl
of
A####a
,
taking
advantage
of
the
non
-
age
and
helpless
situation
of
his
nephew
,
seized
upon
all
the
papers
of
the
defunct
,
and
afterwards
usurped
the
title
of
lord
A####m
,
to
the
surprize
of
the
servants
,
and
<EOS>
others
who
were
acquainted
with
the
affairs
of
the
family
.
<EOS>
This
usurpation
,
bold
as
it
was
,
produced
no
other
effect
than
that
of
his
being
insulted
by
the
populace
as
he
went
through
the
streets
,
and
the
refusal
of
the
king
at
arms
to
enrol
the
certificate
of
his
brother
's
having
died
without
issue
.
<EOS>
The
first
of
these
inconveniences
he
bore
without
any
sense
of
shame
,
tho
'
not
without
repining
,
conscious
that
it
would
gradually
vanish
with
the
novelty
of
his
invasion
;
and
as
to
the
last
,
he
conquered
it
by
means
well
known
and
obvious
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
will
it
seem
strange
,
that
he
should
thus
invade
the
rights
of
an
orphan
with
impunity
,
if
people
will
consider
,
that
the
late
lord
A####m
had
not
only
squandered
away
his
fortune
,
with
the
most
ridiculous
extravagance
,
but
also
associated
himself
with
low
company
;
so
that
he
was
little
known
,
and
less
regarded
,
by
persons
of
any
rank
and
figure
in
life
;
and
his
child
,
of
consequence
,
debarred
of
the
advantages
which
might
have
accrued
from
valuable
connexions
.
    
<EOS>
And
tho
'
<EOS>
it
was
universally
known
,
that
lady
A####m
had
a
son
in
Ireland
,
such
was
the
obscurity
in
which
the
father
had
lived
,
during
the
last
years
of
his
life
,
that
few
of
the
nobility
could
be
supposed
to
be
acquainted
with
the
particular
circumstances
of
a
transaction
in
which
they
had
no
concern
,
and
which
had
happened
at
the
distance
of
twelve
years
before
the
date
of
this
usurpation
.
<EOS>
Moreover
,
as
their
first
information
was
no
other
than
common
fame
,
the
public
clamour
occasioned
by
the
separation
,
might
inspire
such
as
were
strangers
to
the
family
affairs
,
with
a
mistaken
notion
of
the
child
's
having
been
born
about
or
after
the
time
of
that
event
.
<EOS>
The
hurry
and
bustle
occasioned
by
the
arrival
of
the
lord
lieutenant
about
this
period
,
the
reports
industriously
propagated
of
the
claimant
's
death
,
the
obscurity
and
concealment
in
which
the
boy
was
obliged
to
live
,
in
order
to
elude
the
wicked
attempts
of
his
uncle
,
might
also
contribute
to
his
peaceable
enjoyment
of
an
empty
title
:
and
lastly
,
lord
chancellor
W####m
,
whose
immediate
province
it
was
to
issue
writs
for
parliament
,
was
an
utter
stranger
in
Ireland
,
unacquainted
with
the
descents
of
families
,
and
consequently
did
not
examine
farther
than
the
certificate
enrolled
in
the
books
of
the
king
at
arms
.
    
<EOS>
Over
and
above
these
circumstances
,
which
naturally
account
for
the
success
of
the
imposture
,
it
may
be
observed
,
that
the
hapless
youth
had
not
one
relation
alive
,
on
the
side
of
his
father
,
whose
interest
it
was
not
to
forward
or
connive
at
his
destruction
;
that
his
grand
-
father
the
duke
of
B####was
dead
;
and
that
his
mother
was
then
in
England
,
in
a
forlorn
,
destitute
,
dying
condition
,
secreted
from
the
world
,
and
even
from
her
own
relations
,
by
her
woman
Mary
H
#
#
#
#
,
who
had
a
particular
interest
to
secrete
her
,
and
altogether
dependant
upon
a
miserable
and
precarious
allowance
from
the
dutchess
of
B
#
#
#
#
,
to
whose
caprice
<EOS>
she
was
moreover
a
most
wretched
slave
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
concurring
circumstances
in
favour
of
the
usurper
,
he
did
not
think
himself
secure
while
the
orphan
had
any
chance
of
finding
a
friend
who
would
undertake
his
cause
;
and
therefore
laid
a
plan
for
his
being
kidnapped
,
and
sent
to
America
as
a
slave
.
<EOS>
His
coadjutor
in
this
humane
scheme
,
was
a
person
who
carried
on
the
trade
of
transporting
servants
to
our
plantations
,
and
was
deeply
interested
on
this
occasion
,
having
,
for
a
meer
trifle
,
purchased
of
the
late
lord
<EOS>
A####m
<EOS>
the
reversion
of
a
considerable
part
of
the
A####a
estate
;
which
shameful
bargain
was
confirmed
by
the
brother
,
but
could
never
take
place
,
unless
the
boy
could
be
effectually
removed
.
    
<EOS>
Every
thing
being
settled
with
this
auxiliary
,
several
ruffians
,
were
employed
in
search
of
the
unhappy
victim
;
and
the
first
attempt
that
was
made
upon
him
,
in
which
his
uncle
personally
assisted
,
happening
near
one
of
the
great
markets
of
the
city
of
Dublin
,
an
honest
butcher
,
with
the
assistance
of
his
neighbours
,
rescued
him
by
force
from
their
cruel
hands
.
    
<EOS>
This
,
however
,
was
but
a
short
respite
;
for
(
tho
'
,
warned
by
this
adventure
,
the
boy
seldom
crept
out
of
his
lurking
places
,
without
the
most
cautious
circumspection
)
<EOS>
he
was
,
in
March
1727
,
discovered
by
the
diligence
of
his
persecutors
,
and
forcibly
dragged
on
board
of
a
ship
bound
for
Newcastle
on
Delaware
river
in
America
,
where
he
was
sold
as
a
slave
,
and
kept
to
hard
labour
,
much
above
his
age
or
strength
,
for
the
space
of
thirteen
years
,
during
which
he
was
transferred
from
one
person
to
another
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
remained
in
this
servile
situation
,
he
often
mentioned
,
to
those
in
whom
he
thought
such
confidence
might
be
placed
,
the
circumstances
of
his
birth
and
title
,
together
with
the
manner
of
his
being
exiled
from
his
native
country
;
although
,
in
this
particular
,
he
neglected
a
caution
which
he
had
received
in
his
passage
,
importing
,
that
such
discovery
would
cost
him
his
life
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
the
usurper
quietly
enjoyed
his
right
;
and
to
those
who
questioned
him
about
his
brother
's
son
,
constantly
replied
,
that
the
boy
had
been
dead
for
several
years
.
<EOS>
And
Arthur
earl
of
A####a
dying
in
April
1737
,
he
,
upon
pretence
of
being
next
heir
,
succeeded
to
the
honours
and
estate
of
that
nobleman
.
    
<EOS>
The
term
of
the
nephew
's
bondage
,
which
had
been
lengthened
out
beyond
the
usual
time
,
on
account
of
his
repeated
attempts
to
escape
,
being
expired
in
the
year
1739
,
he
hired
himself
as
a
common
sailor
in
a
trading
vessel
bound
to
Jamaica
;
and
there
,
being
entered
on
board
of
one
of
his
majesty
's
ships
under
the
command
of
admiral
Vernon
,
openly
declared
his
parentage
and
pretensions
.
    
<EOS>
This
extraordinary
claim
,
which
made
a
great
noise
in
the
fleet
,
reaching
the
ears
of
one
lieutenant
<EOS>
S####n
,
nearly
related
to
the
usurper
's
Irish
wife
,
he
believed
the
young
gentleman
to
be
an
impostor
;
and
thinking
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
to
discover
the
cheat
,
he
went
on
board
of
the
ship
to
which
the
claimant
belonged
,
and
,
having
heard
the
account
which
he
gave
of
himself
,
was
,
notwithstanding
his
prepossessions
,
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
he
alledged
:
and
,
on
his
return
to
his
own
ship
,
chanced
to
mention
this
extraordinary
affair
upon
the
quarter
-
deck
,
in
the
hearing
of
Mr
B####n
,
one
of
the
midshipmen
,
who
had
formerly
been
at
school
with
Mr
A####y
.
<EOS>
This
young
gentleman
not
only
told
the
lieutenant
,
that
he
had
been
school
-
fellow
with
lord
A####m
's
son
,
but
also
declared
that
he
should
know
him
again
,
if
not
greatly
altered
,
as
he
still
retained
a
perfect
idea
of
his
countenance
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
this
intimation
,
the
lieutenant
proposed
that
the
experiment
should
be
tried
;
and
went
with
the
midshipman
on
board
the
ship
that
the
claimant
was
in
for
that
purpose
.
<EOS>
After
all
the
sailors
had
been
assembled
upon
deck
,
Mr
B####n
,
casting
his
eyes
around
,
immediately
distinguished
Mr
A####y
in
the
croud
,
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
,
"
This
is
the
man
,
"
said
he
;
<EOS>
affirming
at
the
same
time
,
that
,
while
he
continued
at
school
with
him
,
the
claimant
was
reputed
and
respected
as
lord
A####m
's
son
and
heir
,
and
maintained
in
all
respects
suitable
to
the
dignity
of
his
rank
.
<EOS>
Nay
,
he
was
,
in
like
manner
,
recognized
by
several
other
persons
in
the
fleet
,
who
had
known
him
in
his
infancy
.
    
<EOS>
These
things
being
reported
to
the
admiral
,
he
generously
ordered
him
to
be
supplied
with
necessaries
,
and
treated
like
a
gentleman
;
and
,
in
his
next
dispatches
,
transmitted
an
account
of
the
affair
to
the
duke
of
Newcastle
,
among
the
other
transactions
of
the
fleet
.
    
<EOS>
In
September
or
October
1741
,
Mr
A####y
arrived
in
London
;
and
the
first
person
to
whom
he
applied
for
advice
and
assistance
,
was
a
man
of
the
law
,
nearly
related
to
the
families
of
A####a
and
A####m
,
and
well
acquainted
with
the
particular
affairs
of
each
,
who
,
far
from
treating
him
as
a
bastard
and
impostor
,
received
him
with
civility
and
seeming
kindness
,
asked
him
to
eat
,
presented
him
with
a
piece
of
money
,
and
,
excusing
himself
from
meddling
in
the
affair
,
advised
him
to
go
to
Ireland
,
as
the
most
proper
place
for
commencing
a
suit
for
the
recovery
of
his
right
.
    
<EOS>
Before
the
young
gentleman
had
an
opportunity
,
or
indeed
any
inclination
,
to
comply
with
this
advice
,
he
was
accidentally
met
in
the
street
by
that
same
H####n
,
who
,
as
I
have
mentioned
,
gave
Mr
M####r
the
first
insight
into
the
affair
:
this
man
immediately
knew
the
claimant
,
having
been
formerly
an
agent
for
his
father
,
and
afterwards
a
creature
of
his
uncle
's
,
with
whom
he
was
,
not
without
reason
,
suspected
to
be
concerned
in
kidnapping
and
transporting
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
Be
that
as
it
will
,
his
connections
with
the
usurper
were
now
broke
off
by
a
quarrel
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
had
thrown
up
his
agency
;
and
he
invited
the
hapless
stranger
to
his
house
,
with
a
view
of
making
all
possible
advantage
of
such
a
guest
.
    
<EOS>
There
he
had
not
long
remained
,
when
his
treacherous
landlord
,
tampering
with
his
inexperience
,
effected
a
marriage
between
him
and
the
daughter
of
one
of
his
own
friends
,
who
lodged
in
his
house
at
the
same
time
:
but
afterwards
,
seeing
no
person
of
consequence
willing
to
espouse
his
cause
,
he
looked
upon
him
as
an
incumbrance
,
and
wanted
to
rid
his
hands
of
him
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
He
remembered
that
Mr
M####r
had
expressed
himself
with
all
the
humanity
of
apprehension
,
in
favour
of
the
unfortunate
young
nobleman
,
before
his
arrival
in
England
;
and
being
well
acquainted
with
the
generosity
of
his
disposition
,
he
no
sooner
understood
that
he
was
returned
from
France
,
than
he
waited
upon
him
with
an
account
of
Mr
A####y
's
being
safely
arrived
.
<EOS>
Mr
M####r
was
sincerely
rejoiced
to
find
,
that
a
person
who
had
been
so
cruelly
injured
,
and
undergone
so
long
and
continued
a
scene
of
distress
,
was
restored
to
a
country
where
he
was
sure
of
obtaining
justice
,
and
where
every
good
man
(
as
he
imagined
)
would
make
the
cause
his
own
:
and
,
being
informed
that
the
youth
was
in
want
of
necessaries
,
he
gave
twenty
guineas
to
H####n
for
his
use
,
and
promised
to
do
him
all
the
service
in
his
power
;
but
had
no
intention
to
take
upon
himself
the
whole
weight
of
such
an
important
affair
,
or
indeed
to
appear
in
the
cause
,
until
he
should
be
fully
and
thoroughly
satisfied
that
the
claimant
's
pretensions
were
well
founded
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
H####n
insinuating
that
the
young
gentleman
was
not
safe
in
his
present
lodging
,
from
the
machinations
of
his
enemies
,
M####r
accommodated
him
with
an
apartment
in
his
own
house
;
where
he
was
at
great
pains
to
remedy
the
defect
in
his
education
,
by
rendering
him
fit
to
appear
as
a
gentleman
in
the
world
:
and
having
received
from
him
all
the
intelligence
he
could
give
,
relating
to
his
own
affair
,
laid
the
case
before
council
,
and
dispatched
a
person
to
Ireland
,
to
make
further
enquiries
upon
the
same
subject
;
who
,
on
his
first
arrival
in
that
kingdom
,
found
the
claimant
's
birth
was
as
publickly
known
as
any
circumstance
of
that
kind
<EOS>
could
possibly
be
,
at
so
great
a
distance
of
time
.

The
usurper
and
his
friends
gave
all
the
interruption
in
their
power
to
any
researches
concerning
that
affair
;
and
had
recourse
to
every
art
and
expedient
that
could
be
invented
,
to
prevent
its
being
brought
to
a
legal
discussion
:
privilege
,
bills
in
chancery
,
orders
of
court
surreptitiously
and
illegally
obtained
,
and
every
other
invention
,
was
made
use
of
to
bar
and
prevent
a
fair
and
honest
trial
by
a
jury
.
<EOS>
The
usurper
himself
,
and
his
agents
,
at
the
same
time
that
they
formed
divers
conspiracies
against
his
life
,
in
vain
endeavoured
to
detach
Mr
M####r
from
the
orphan
's
cause
by
innumerable
artifices
,
insinuating
,
cajoling
,
and
misrepresenting
with
surprising
dexterity
and
perseverance
.
    
<EOS>
His
protector
,
far
from
being
satisfied
with
their
reasons
,
was
not
only
deaf
to
their
remonstrances
,
but
,
believing
him
in
danger
from
their
repeated
efforts
,
had
him
privately
conveyed
into
the
country
;
where
an
unhappy
accident
(
which
he
hath
ever
since
sincerely
regreted
)
furnished
his
adversary
a
colourable
pretext
to
cut
him
off
in
the
beginning
of
his
career
.
    
<EOS>
A
man
happening
to
lose
his
life
,
by
the
accidental
discharge
of
a
piece
,
that
chanced
to
be
in
the
young
gentleman
's
hands
,
the
account
of
this
misfortune
<EOS>
no
sooner
reached
the
ears
of
his
uncle
,
than
he
expressed
the
most
immoderate
joy
at
having
found
so
good
a
handle
for
destroying
him
,
under
colour
of
law
.
    
<EOS>
He
immediately
constituted
himself
prosecutor
,
set
his
emissaries
at
work
to
secure
a
coroner
's
inquest
suited
to
his
cruel
purposes
;
set
out
for
the
place
in
person
,
to
take
care
that
the
prisoner
should
not
escape
;
insulted
him
in
jail
,
in
the
most
inhuman
manner
;
employed
a
whole
army
of
attornies
and
agents
,
to
spirit
up
and
carry
on
a
most
virulent
prosecution
;
practised
all
the
unfair
methods
that
could
be
invented
,
in
order
that
the
unhappy
gentleman
should
be
transported
to
Newgate
,
from
the
healthy
prison
to
which
he
was
at
first
committed
;
endeavoured
to
inveigle
him
into
destructive
confessions
;
and
,
not
to
mention
other
more
infamous
arts
employed
in
the
affair
of
evidence
,
attempted
to
surprize
him
upon
his
trial
,
in
the
absence
of
his
witnesses
and
council
,
contrary
to
a
previous
agreement
with
the
prosecutor
's
own
attorney
:
<EOS>
nay
,
he
even
appeared
in
person
upon
the
bench
at
the
trial
,
in
order
to
intimidate
the
evidence
,
and
brow
-
beat
the
unfortunate
prisoner
at
the
bar
,
and
expended
above
a
thousand
pounds
in
that
prosecution
.
<EOS>
In
spite
of
all
his
wicked
efforts
,
however
,
which
were
defeated
by
the
spirit
and
indefatigable
industry
of
Mr
M####r
,
the
young
gentleman
was
honourably
acquitted
,
to
the
evident
satisfaction
of
all
the
impartial
;
the
misfortune
that
gave
a
handle
for
that
unnatural
prosecution
,
appearing
to
a
demonstration
to
have
been
a
mere
accident
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
few
months
,
his
protector
,
who
had
now
openly
espoused
his
cause
,
(
taking
with
him
two
gentlemen
to
witness
his
transactions
)
conducted
him
to
his
native
country
,
with
a
view
to
be
better
informed
of
the
strength
of
his
pretensions
,
than
he
could
be
by
the
intelligences
he
had
hitherto
received
,
or
by
the
claimant
's
own
dark
and
almost
obliterated
remembrance
of
the
facts
which
were
essential
to
be
known
.
<EOS>
Upon
their
arrival
in
Dublin
,
application
was
made
to
those
persons
whom
Mr
A####y
had
named
as
his
schoolmasters
and
companions
,
together
with
the
servants
and
neighbours
of
his
father
.
    
<EOS>
These
,
though
examined
separately
,
without
having
the
least
previous
intimation
of
what
the
claimant
had
reported
,
agreed
in
their
accounts
with
him
,
as
well
as
with
one
another
,
and
mentioned
many
other
people
as
acquainted
with
the
same
facts
to
whom
Mr
M####r
had
recourse
,
and
still
met
with
the
same
unvaried
information
.
<EOS>
By
these
means
,
he
made
such
progress
in
his
inquiries
,
that
in
less
than
two
months
no
fewer
than
one
hundred
persons
,
from
different
quarters
of
the
kingdom
,
either
personally
,
or
by
letters
,
communicated
their
knowledge
of
the
claimant
,
in
declarations
consonant
with
one
another
,
as
well
as
with
the
accounts
he
gave
of
himself
.
<EOS>
Several
servants
who
had
lived
with
his
father
,
and
been
deceived
with
the
story
of
his
death
,
so
industriously
propagated
by
his
uncle
,
no
sooner
heard
of
his
being
in
Dublin
,
than
they
came
from
different
parts
of
the
country
to
see
him
;
and
though
great
pains
were
taken
to
deceive
them
,
they
,
nevertheless
,
knew
him
at
first
sight
;
some
of
them
fell
upon
their
knees
,
to
thank
heaven
for
his
preservation
,
embraced
his
legs
,
and
shed
tears
of
joy
for
his
return
.
    
<EOS>
Although
the
conduct
of
his
adversary
,
particularly
in
the
above
-
mentioned
prosecution
,
together
with
the
evidence
that
already
appeared
,
were
sufficient
to
convince
all
mankind
of
the
truth
of
the
claimant
's
pretensions
,
Mr
M####r
,
in
order
to
be
further
satisfied
,
resolved
to
see
how
he
would
be
received
upon
the
spot
where
he
was
born
;
justly
concluding
,
that
if
he
was
really
an
impostor
,
the
bastard
of
a
kitchen
-
wench
,
produced
in
a
country
intirely
possessed
by
his
enemy
and
his
allies
,
he
must
be
looked
upon
in
that
place
with
the
utmost
detestation
and
contempt
.
    
<EOS>
This
his
intention
was
no
sooner
known
to
the
adverse
party
,
than
their
agents
and
friends
,
from
all
quarters
,
<EOS>
repaired
to
that
place
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
and
used
all
their
influence
with
the
people
,
in
remonstrances
,
threats
,
and
all
the
other
arts
they
could
devise
,
not
only
to
discountenance
the
claimant
upon
his
arrival
,
but
even
to
spirit
up
a
mob
to
insult
him
.
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
these
precautions
,
and
the
servile
awe
and
subjection
in
which
tenants
are
kept
by
their
landlords
in
that
part
of
the
country
,
as
soon
as
it
was
known
that
Mr
A####y
approached
the
town
,
the
inhabitants
crowded
out
in
great
multitudes
to
receive
and
welcome
him
,
and
accompanied
him
into
town
with
acclamations
and
other
expressions
of
joy
,
insomuch
that
the
agents
of
his
adversary
durst
not
shew
their
faces
.
<EOS>
The
sovereign
of
the
corporation
,
who
was
a
particular
creature
and
favourite
of
the
usurper
,
and
whose
all
depended
upon
the
issue
of
the
cause
,
was
so
conscious
of
the
stranger
's
right
,
and
so
much
awed
by
the
behaviour
of
the
people
,
who
knew
that
consciousness
,
that
he
did
not
think
it
safe
,
even
to
preserve
the
appearance
of
neutrality
upon
this
occasion
,
but
actually
held
the
stirrup
while
Mr
A####y
dismounted
from
his
horse
.
    
<EOS>
This
sense
of
conviction
in
the
people
,
manifested
itself
still
more
powerfully
,
when
he
returned
to
the
same
place
in
the
year
1744
,
about
which
time
lord
A####a
being
informed
of
his
resolution
,
determined
again
to
be
before
-
hand
with
him
,
and
set
out
in
person
with
his
agents
and
friends
,
some
of
whom
were
detached
before
him
,
to
prepare
for
his
reception
,
and
induce
the
people
to
meet
him
in
a
body
,
and
accompany
him
to
town
,
with
such
expressions
of
welcome
as
they
had
before
bestowed
on
his
nephew
:
but
in
spite
of
all
their
art
and
interest
,
he
was
suffered
to
pass
through
the
street
in
a
mournful
silence
;
and
though
several
barrels
of
beer
were
produced
,
to
court
the
favour
of
the
populace
,
they
had
no
other
effect
than
that
of
drawing
their
ridicule
upon
the
donor
;
whereas
,
when
Mr
A####y
,
two
days
afterwards
,
appeared
,
all
the
inhabitants
,
with
garlands
,
streamers
,
music
,
and
other
ensigns
of
joy
,
crowded
out
to
meet
him
,
and
ushered
him
into
town
with
such
demonstrations
of
pleasure
and
good
-
will
,
that
the
noble
peer
found
it
convenient
to
hide
himself
from
the
resentment
of
his
own
tenants
,
the
effects
of
which
he
must
have
severely
felt
,
had
not
he
been
screened
by
the
timely
remonstrances
of
Mr
M####r
,
and
the
other
gentlemen
who
accompanied
his
competitor
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
did
his
apprehension
vanish
with
the
transactions
of
this
day
;
the
town
was
again
in
uproar
on
the
Sunday
following
,
when
it
was
known
that
Mr
A####y
intended
to
come
thither
,
from
Dunmain
,
to
church
:
they
went
out
to
meet
him
as
before
,
and
conducted
him
to
the
church
-
door
with
acclamations
,
which
terrified
his
uncle
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
fled
with
precipitation
in
a
boat
,
and
soon
after
intirely
quitted
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
be
almost
an
endless
task
to
enumerate
the
particular
steps
that
were
taken
by
one
side
to
promote
,
and
by
the
other
to
delay
the
trial
:
<EOS>
the
young
gentleman
's
adversaries
finding
that
they
could
not
,
by
all
the
subterfuges
and
arts
they
had
used
,
evade
it
,
repeated
attempts
were
made
to
assassinate
him
and
his
protector
,
and
every
obstruction
thrown
in
the
way
of
his
cause
which
craft
could
invent
,
villany
execute
,
and
undue
influence
confirm
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
difficulties
were
surmounted
by
the
vigilance
,
constancy
,
courage
and
sagacity
of
M####r
;
and
,
at
last
,
the
affair
was
brought
to
a
very
solemn
trial
at
bar
,
which
being
continued
,
by
several
adjournments
,
from
the
eleventh
to
the
twenty
-
fifth
day
of
November
,
a
verdict
was
found
for
the
claimant
,
by
a
jury
of
gentlemen
,
which
,
in
point
of
reputation
and
property
,
can
not
be
easily
paralelled
in
the
annals
of
that
or
any
other
country
;
a
jury
that
could
by
no
means
be
suspected
of
prepossessions
in
favour
of
Mr
An####y
,
(
to
whose
person
they
were
absolute
strangers
)
especially
if
we
consider
that
a
gentleman
in
their
neighbourhood
,
who
was
nephew
to
the
foreman
,
and
nearly
related
to
some
of
the
rest
of
their
number
,
forfeited
a
considerable
estate
by
their
decision
.
    
<EOS>
This
verdict
(
said
the
parson
)
gave
the
highest
satisfaction
to
all
impartial
persons
that
were
within
reach
of
being
truly
informed
of
their
proceedings
,
and
of
the
different
genius
and
conduct
of
the
parties
engaged
in
the
contest
;
but
more
especially
to
such
as
were
in
court
(
as
I
was
)
at
the
trial
,
and
had
an
opportunity
of
observing
the
characters
and
behaviour
of
the
persons
who
appeared
there
to
give
evidence
.
      
<EOS>
To
such
it
was
very
apparent
,
that
all
the
witnesses
produced
there
on
the
part
of
the
uncle
,
were
either
his
tenants
,
dependents
,
pot
-
companions
,
or
persons
<EOS>
some
way
or
other
interested
in
the
issue
of
the
suit
,
and
remarkable
for
a
low
kind
of
cunning
:
that
many
of
them
were
persons
of
profligate
lives
,
who
deserved
no
credit
:
that
(
independent
of
the
levity
of
their
characters
)
those
of
them
who
went
under
the
denomination
of
colonels
,
(
colonel
L####fts
alone
excepted
,
who
had
nothing
to
say
,
and
was
only
brought
there
in
order
to
give
credit
to
that
party
)
made
so
ridiculous
a
figure
,
and
gave
so
absurd
,
contradictory
and
inconsistent
an
evidence
,
as
no
court
or
jury
could
give
the
least
degree
of
credit
to
.
  
<EOS>
On
the
other
hand
,
it
was
observed
,
that
the
nephew
and
Mr
M####r
<EOS>
his
chief
manager
,
(
being
absolute
strangers
in
that
country
,
and
unacquainted
with
the
characters
of
the
persons
they
had
to
deal
with
)
were
obliged
to
lay
before
the
court
and
jury
such
evidence
as
came
to
their
hand
,
some
of
whom
plainly
appeared
to
have
been
put
upon
them
by
their
adversaries
,
with
a
design
to
hurt
 
<EOS>
It
was
also
manifest
,
that
the
witnesses
produced
for
Mr
A####y
were
such
as
could
have
no
manner
of
connexion
with
him
,
nor
any
dependence
whatsoever
upon
him
,
to
influence
their
evidence
;
for
the
far
greatest
part
of
them
had
never
seen
him
from
his
infancy
,
till
the
trial
began
;
and
that
many
of
them
(
though
poor
and
undignified
with
the
title
of
colonels
)
were
people
of
unblemished
character
,
of
great
simplicity
,
and
such
as
no
man
in
his
senses
would
pitch
upon
to
support
a
bad
cause
.
  
<EOS>
It
is
plain
that
the
jury
,
(
whose
well
-
known
honour
,
impartiality
and
penetration
must
be
revered
by
all
who
are
acquainted
with
them
)
were
not
under
the
least
difficulty
about
their
verdict
;
for
they
were
not
inclosed
above
half
an
hour
,
when
they
returned
with
it
.
       
<EOS>
These
gentlemen
could
not
help
observing
the
great
inequality
of
the
parties
engaged
,
the
great
advantages
that
the
uncle
had
in
every
other
respect
(
except
the
truth
and
justice
of
his
case
)
over
the
nephew
,
by
means
of
his
vast
possessions
,
and
of
his
power
and
influence
all
round
the
place
of
his
birth
;
nor
could
the
contrast
between
the
different
genius
's
of
the
two
parties
escape
their
observation
.
  
<EOS>
They
could
not
but
see
and
conclude
,
that
a
person
who
had
confessedly
transported
and
sold
his
orphan
-
nephew
into
slavery
,
who
,
on
his
return
,
had
carried
on
so
unwarrantable
and
cruel
a
prosecution
to
take
away
his
life
,
under
colour
of
law
,
and
who
had
also
given
such
glaring
proofs
of
his
skill
and
dexterity
in
the
management
of
witnesses
for
that
cruel
purpose
,
was
in
like
manner
capable
of
exerting
the
same
happy
talent
on
this
occasion
,
when
his
all
was
at
stake
;
<EOS>
more
especially
,
as
he
had
so
many
others
who
were
equally
interested
with
himself
,
and
whose
abilities
,
in
that
respect
,
fell
nothing
short
of
his
own
,
to
second
him
in
it
.
  
<EOS>
The
gentlemen
of
the
jury
had
also
a
near
view
of
the
manner
in
which
the
witnesses
delivered
their
testimonies
,
and
had
from
thence
an
opportunity
of
observing
many
circumstances
and
distinguishing
characteristics
of
truth
and
falshood
,
from
which
a
great
deal
could
be
gathered
,
that
could
not
be
adequately
conveyed
by
any
printed
account
,
how
exact
soever
;
consequently
,
they
must
have
been
much
better
judges
of
the
evidence
on
which
they
founded
their
verdict
,
than
any
person
,
who
had
not
the
same
opportunity
,
can
possibly
be
.
    
<EOS>
These
,
Mr
Pickle
,
were
my
reflections
on
what
I
had
occasion
to
observe
concerning
that
famous
trial
;
and
on
my
return
to
England
two
years
after
,
I
could
not
help
pitying
the
self
-
sufficiency
of
some
people
,
who
,
at
this
distance
,
pretended
to
pass
their
judgment
on
that
verdict
with
as
great
positiveness
,
as
if
they
had
been
in
the
secrets
of
the
cause
,
or
upon
the
jury
who
tried
it
;
and
that
from
no
better
authority
;
than
the
declamations
of
lord
An####a
's
emissaries
,
and
some
falsified
printed
accounts
,
artfully
cooked
up
,
on
purpose
to
mislead
and
deceive
.
    
<EOS>
But
to
return
from
this
digression
,
lord
A####a
,
the
defendant
in
that
cause
,
was
so
conscious
of
the
strength
and
merits
of
his
injured
nephew
's
case
,
and
that
a
verdict
would
go
against
him
,
that
he
ordered
a
writ
of
error
to
be
made
out
before
the
trial
was
ended
;
and
the
verdict
was
no
sooner
given
,
than
he
immediately
lodged
it
,
though
he
well
knew
he
had
no
manner
of
error
to
assign
.
<EOS>
This
expedient
was
practised
merely
for
vexation
and
delay
,
in
order
to
keep
Mr
A####y
from
the
possession
of
the
small
estate
he
had
recovered
by
the
verdict
;
that
,
his
slender
funds
being
exhausted
,
he
might
be
deprived
of
other
means
to
prosecute
his
right
;
and
,
by
the
most
oppressive
contrivances
and
scandalous
chicanery
,
it
has
been
kept
up
to
this
day
,
without
his
being
able
to
assign
the
least
shadow
of
any
error
.
    
<EOS>
Lord
A####a
was
not
the
only
antagonist
that
Mr
A####y
had
to
deal
with
;
all
the
different
branches
of
the
A####a
family
,
who
had
been
worrying
one
another
at
law
ever
since
the
death
of
the
late
earl
of
A####a
,
about
the
partition
of
his
great
estate
,
were
now
firmly
united
in
an
association
against
this
unfortunate
gentleman
;
mutual
deeds
were
executed
among
them
,
by
which
many
great
lordships
and
estates
were
given
up
by
the
uncle
to
persons
who
had
no
right
to
possess
them
,
in
order
to
engage
them
to
side
with
him
against
his
nephew
,
in
withholding
the
unjust
possession
of
the
remainder
.
    
<EOS>
These
confederates
having
held
several
consultations
against
their
common
enemy
,
and
finding
that
his
cause
gathered
daily
strength
since
the
trial
,
by
the
accession
of
many
witnesses
of
figure
and
reputation
,
who
had
not
been
heard
of
before
;
and
that
the
only
chance
they
had
to
prevent
the
speedy
establishment
of
his
right
,
and
their
own
destruction
,
was
by
stripping
Mr
M####r
of
the
little
money
that
yet
remained
,
and
stopping
all
further
resources
whereby
he
might
be
enabled
to
proceed
;
they
,
therefore
,
came
to
a
determined
resolution
to
carry
that
hopeful
scheme
into
execution
;
and
,
in
pursuance
thereof
,
they
have
left
no
expedient
or
stratagem
,
how
extraordinary
or
scandalous
soever
,
unpractised
to
distress
Mr
An####y
and
that
gentleman
.
<EOS>
For
that
end
,
all
the
oppressive
arts
and
dilatory
expensive
contrivances
that
the
fertile
invention
of
the
lowest
pettifoggers
of
the
law
could
possibly
devise
,
have
with
great
dexterity
been
played
off
against
them
in
fruitless
,
quibbling
,
and
malicious
suits
,
intirely
foreign
to
the
merits
of
the
cause
.
<EOS>
Not
to
mention
numberless
other
acts
of
oppression
,
the
most
extraordinary
and
unprecedented
proceedings
,
by
means
whereof
this
sham
writ
of
error
hath
been
kept
on
foot
ever
since
November
1743
,
is
to
me
(
said
the
doctor
)
a
most
flagrant
instance
,
not
only
of
the
prevalency
of
power
and
money
,
(
<EOS>
when
employed
,
as
in
the
present
case
,
against
an
unfortunate
,
helpless
man
,
disabled
,
as
he
is
,
of
the
means
of
ascertaining
his
right
)
but
of
the
badness
of
a
cause
,
that
hath
recourse
to
so
many
iniquitous
expedients
to
support
it
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
word
,
the
whole
conduct
of
lord
A####a
and
his
party
,
from
the
beginning
to
this
time
,
hath
been
such
,
as
sufficiently
manifests
,
that
it
could
proceed
from
no
other
motives
than
a
consciousness
of
Mr
A####y
's
right
,
and
of
their
own
illegal
usurpations
,
and
from
a
terror
of
trusting
the
merits
of
their
case
to
a
fair
discussion
by
the
laws
of
their
country
:
and
that
the
intention
and
main
drift
of
all
their
proceedings
plainly
tends
to
stifle
and
smother
the
merits
of
the
case
from
the
knowledge
of
the
world
,
by
oppressive
arts
and
and
ingenious
delays
,
rather
than
trust
it
to
the
candid
determination
of
an
honest
jury
.
<EOS>
What
else
could
be
the
motives
of
kid
-
knapping
the
claimant
,
and
transporting
him
when
an
infant
?
<EOS>
of
the
various
attempts
made
upon
his
life
since
his
return
?
<EOS>
of
the
attempts
to
divest
him
of
all
assistance
to
ascertain
his
right
,
by
endeavouring
so
solicitously
to
prevail
on
Mr
M####r
to
abandon
him
in
the
beginning
?
<EOS>
of
retaining
an
army
of
counsel
,
before
any
suit
had
been
commenced
?
<EOS>
of
the
many
sinister
attempts
to
prevent
the
trial
at
bar
?
<EOS>
of
the
various
arts
made
use
of
to
terrify
any
one
from
appearing
as
witness
for
the
claimant
,
and
to
seduce
those
who
had
appeared
?
<EOS>
of
the
shameless
,
unprecedented
,
low
tricks
now
practised
,
to
keep
him
out
of
the
possession
of
that
estate
for
which
he
had
obtained
the
verdict
,
thereby
to
disable
him
from
bringing
his

up

<EOS>
Is
it
not
obvious
from
all
these
circumstances
,
as
well
as
from
the
obstruction
they
have
given
to
the
attorney
-
general
's
proceeding
to
make
a
report
to
his
majesty
,
on
the
claimant
's
petition
to
the
King
for
the
peerage
,
which
was
referred
by
his
majesty
to
that
gentleman
,
so
far
back
as
1743
;
that
all
their
efforts
are
bent
to
that
one
point
of
stifling
,
rather
than
suffering
the
merits
of
this
cause
to
come
to
a
fair
and
candid
hearing
;
and
that
the
sole
consideration
at
present
between
them
and
this
unfortunate
man
is
not
,
whether
he
is
right
or
wrong
,
but
whether
he
shall
or
shall
not
find
money
to
bring
this
cause
to
a
final
determination

<EOS>
Lord
A####a
and
his
confederates
not
thinking
themselves
safe
with
all
these
expedients
,
while
there
was
a
possibility
of
their
antagonist
's
obtaining
any
assistance
from
such
as
humanity
,
compassion
,
generosity
,
or
a
love
of
justice
might
induce
to
lay
open
their
purses
to
his
assistance
,
in
ascertaining
his
right
,
have
,
by
themselves
and
their
numerous
emissaries
,
employed
all
the
arts
of
calumny
,
slander
and
detraction
against
him
,
by
traducing
his
cause
,
vilifying
his
person
,
and
most
basely
and
cruelly
tearing
his
character
to
pieces
,
by
a
thousand
misrepresentations
,
purposely
invented
and
industriously
propagated
in
all
places
of
resort
,
which
is
a
kind
of
cowardly
assassination
that
there
is
no
guarding
against
:
yet
,
in
spite
of
all
these
machinations
,
and
the
shameful
indifference
of
mankind
,
who
stand
aloof
unconcerned
,
and
see
this
unhappy
gentleman
most
inhumanly
oppressed
by
the
weight
of
lawless
power
and
faction
,
M####r
,
far
from
suffering
himself
to
be
dejected
by
the
multiplying
difficulties
that
croud
upon
him
,
still
exerts
himself
with
amazing
fortitude
and
assiduity
,
and
will
(
I
doubt
not
)
bring
the
affair
he
began
and
carried
on
with
so
so
much
spirit
,
while
his
finances
lasted
,
to
an
happy
conclusion
.
    
<EOS>
It
would
exceed
the
bounds
of
my
intention
,
and
perhaps
trespass
too
much
upon
your
time
,
were
I
to
enumerate
the
low
artifices
and
shameful
quibbles
,
by
which
the
usurper
has
found
means
to
procrastinate
the
decision
of
the
contest
between
him
and
his
hapless
nephew
,
or
to
give
a
detail
of
the
damage
and
perplexity
which
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
has
sustained
and
been
involved
in
,
by
the
treachery
and
ingratitude
of
some
who
listed
themselves
under
him
in
the
prosecution
of
this
affair
,
and
by
the
villainy
of
others
,
who
,
under
various
pretences
of
material
discoveries
they
had
to
make
,
&
c.
had
fastened
themselves
upon
him
,
and
continued
to
do
all
the
mischief
in
their
power
,
until
the
cloven
foot
was
detected
.
    
<EOS>
One
instance
,
however
,
is
so
flagrantly
flagitious
,
that
I
can
not
resist
the
inclination
I
feel
to
relate
it
,
as
an
example
of
the
most
infernal
perfidy
that
perhaps
ever
entered
the
human
heart
.
<EOS>
I
have
already
mentioned
the
part
which
H####n
acted
in
the
beginning
of
M
#
#
#
#
's
connection
with
the
unfortunate
stranger
,
and
hinted
that
the
said
H####n
lay
under
many
obligations
to
that
gentleman
,
before
Mr
A####y
's
arrival
in
England
.
<EOS>
He
had
been
chief
agent
to
lord
A####y
,
and
,
as
it
afterwards
appeared
,
received
several
payments
of
a
secret
pension
which
that
lord
enjoyed
,
for
which
he
either
could
not
,
or
would
not
account
.
<EOS>
His
lordship
,
therefore
,
in
order
to
compel
him
to
it
,
took
out
writs
against
him
,
and
his
house
was
continually
surrounded
with
catchpoles
for
the
space
of
two
whole
years
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
believing
,
from
H####n
's
own
account
of
the
matter
,
that
the
poor
man
was
greatly
injured
,
and
persecuted
on
account
of
his
attachment
to
the
unhappy
young
gentleman
,
did
him
all
the
good
offices
in
his
power
,
and
became
security
for
him
on
several
occasions
:
<EOS>
nay
,
such
was
his
opinion
of
his
integrity
,
that
after
Mr
A####y
was
cleared
of
the
prosecution
carried
on
against
him
by
his
uncle
,
his
person
was
trusted
to
the
care
of
this
hypocrite
,
who
desired
that
the
young
gentleman
might
lodge
at
his
house
for
the
convenience
of
air
,
M
#
#
#
#
's
own
occasions
calling
him
often
into
the
country
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
,
by
his
consummate
dissimulation
,
acquired
such
a
valuable
charge
,
he
wrote
a
letter
to
one
of
lord
A####y
's
attornies
,
offering
to
betray
Mr
An####ey
;
provided
his
lordship
would
settle
his
account
,
and
give
him
a
discharge
for
eight
hundred
pounds
of
the
pension
,
which
he
had
received
,
and
not
accounted
for
.
<EOS>
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
,
informed
of
this
treacherous
proposal
,
immediately
removed
his
lodger
from
his
house
into
his
own
,
without
assigning
his
reasons
for
so
doing
,
until
he
was
obliged
to
declare
it
,
in
order
to
free
himself
from
the
importunities
of
H####n
,
who
earnestly
solicited
his
return
.
<EOS>
This
miscreant
finding
himself
detected
,
and
disappointed
in
his
villainous
design
,
was
so
much
enraged
at
his
miscarriage
,
that
,
forgetting
all
the
benefits
he
had
received
from
M
#
#
#
#
for
a
series
of
years
,
he
practised
all
the
mischief
that
his
malice
could
contrive
against
him
;
and
at
length
entered
into
a
confederacy
with
one
G####tr
 
y
,
and
several
other
abandoned
wretches
,
who
,
as
before
said
,
under
various
pretences
of
being
able
to
make
material
discoveries
,
and
otherwise
to
serve
the
cause
,
had
found
means
to
be
employed
in
some
extra
-
business
relating
to
it
,
tho
'
their
real
intention
was
to
betray
the
claimant
.
    
<EOS>
These
confederates
,
in
conjunction
with
some
other
auxiliaries
of
infamous
character
,
being
informed
that
Mr
M####r
was
on
the
point
of
securing
a
considerable
sum
,
to
enable
him
to
prosecute
Mr
An####y
's
right
,
and
to
bring
it
to
a
happy
conclusion
,
contrived
a
deep
laid
scheme
to
disappoint
him
in
it
,
and
at
once
to
ruin
the
cause
.
<EOS>
And
previous
measures
being
taken
for
that
wicked
purpose
,
they
imposed
upon
the
young
gentleman
's
inexperience
and
credulity
,
by
insinuations
equally
false
,
plausible
,
and
malicious
;
to
which
they
at
length
gained
his
belief
,
by
the
mention
of
some
circumstances
that
gave
what
they
alleged
an
air
of
probability
,
and
even
of
truth
.
<EOS>
They
swore
that
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
had
taken
out
an
action
against
him
for
a
very
large
sum
of
money
;
that
they
had
actually
seen
the
writ
;
that
the
intention
of
it
was
to
throw
him
into
prison
for
life
,
and
ruin
his
cause
,
in
consequence
of
an
agreement
made
by
him
with
lord
A####ey
,
and
his
other
enemies
,
to
retrieve
the
money
that
he
had
laid
out
in
the
cause
.
    
<EOS>
This
plausible
tale
was
enforced
with
such
an
air
of
truth
,
candor
,
and
earnest
concern
for
his
safety
,
and
was
strengthened
by
so
many
imprecations
,
and
corroborating
circumstances
of
their
invention
,
as
would
have
staggered
one
of
much
greater
experience
,
and
knowledge
of
mankind
,
than
Mr
A####ey
could
be
supposed
at
that
time
.
<EOS>
The
notion
of
perpetual
imprisonment
,
and
the
certain
ruin
they
made
him
believe
his
cause
was
threatened
with
,
worked
upon
his
imagination
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
suffered
himself
to
be
led
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
,
by
this
artful
band
of
villains
;
who
secreted
him
at
the
lodgings
of
one
Pr####nt####ce
,
an
intimate
of
G####y
's
,
for
several
days
,
under
colour
of
his
being
hunted
by
bailiffs
employed
by
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
,
where
he
was
not
only
obliged
by
them
to
change
his
name
,
but
even
his
wife
was
not
suffered
to
have
access
to
him
.
    
<EOS>
Their
design
was
to
have
sold
him
,
or
drawn
him
into
a
ruinous
compromise
with
his
adversaries
,
for
a
valuable
consideration
to
themselves
.
<EOS>
But
as
no
ties
are
binding
among
such
a
knot
of
villains
,
the
rest
of
the
conspirators
were
jockied
by
G####st####ey
;
who
,
in
order
to
monopolize
the
advantage
to
himself
,
hurried
his
prize
into
the
country
,
and
secreted
him
even
from
his
confederates
,
in
a
place
of
concealment
one
hundred
miles
from
London
,
under
the
same
ridiculous
pretence
of
M
#
#
#
#
's
having
taken
out
of
a
writ
against
him
,
and
of
bailiffs
being
in
pursuit
of
him
every
where
round
London
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
there
than
G####st####ey
,
as
a
previous
step
to
the
other
villany
he
intended
,
tricked
him
out
of
a
bond
for
six
thousand
pounds
,
under
colour
of
his
having
a
person
ready
to
advance
the
like
sum
upon
it
,
as
an
immediate
fund
for
carrying
on
his
cause
;
assuring
him
,
at
the
same
time
,
that
he
had
a
set
of
gentlemen
ready
,
who
were
willing
to
advance
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
more
for
the
same
purpose
,
and
to
allow
him

<EOS>
Mr
A####ey
,
having
by
this
time
received
some
intimations
of
the
deceit
that
had
been
put
upon
him
,
made
answer
,
that
he
should
look
upon
himself
as
a
very
ungrateful
monster
,
indeed
,
if
he
deserted
a
person
who
had
saved
his
life
,
and
so
generously
ventured
his
own
,
together
with
his
fortune
,
in
his
cause
,
until
he
should
first
be
certain
of
the
truth
of
what
was
alleged
of
him
,
and
absolutely
rejected
the
proposal
.
    
<EOS>
G####st####ey
,
who
had
no
other
view
in
making
it
than
to
cover
the
secret
villany
he
meditated
against
him
,
and
to
facilitate
the
execution
thereof
;
easily
receded
from
it
,
when
he
found
Mr
A####ey
so
averse
to
it
,
and
undertook
nevertheless
to
raise
the
money
;
adding
,
that
he
might
,
if
he
pleased
,
return
to
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
whenever
it
was
secured
.
<EOS>
The
whole
drift
of
this
pretended
undertaking
to
raise
the
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
,
was
only
to
lay
a
foundation
for
a
dexterous
contrivance
to
draw
Mr
A####ey
unwarily
into
the
execution
of
a
deed
,
relinquishing
all
his
right
and
title
,
under
a
notion
of
its
being
a
deed
to
secure
the
repayment
of
that
sum
.
    
<EOS>
G####st####ey
having
,
as
he
imagined
,
so
far
paved
the
way
for
the
execution
of
such
a
deed
,
enters
into
an
agreement
with
an
agent
,
employed
for
that
purpose
by
Mr
A####ey
's
adversaries
,
purporting
,
that
in
consideration
of
the
payment
of
a
bond
for
six
thousand
pounds
,
which
he
,
G####st####ey
,
had
,
as
he
pretended
,
laid
out
in
Mr
A####ey
's
cause
,
and
of
an
annuity
of
seven
hundred
pounds
a
year
,
he
was
to
procure
for
them
from
Mr
A####ey
<EOS>
a
deed
,
ready
executed
,
relinquishing
all
right
and
title
to
the
An####ey
estate
and
honours
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
being
prepared
for
the
execution
of
this
infernal
scheme
,
unknown
to
Mr
A####ey
,
G####st####ey
then
thought
proper
to
send
for
him
to
town
from
his
retirement
,
in
order
,
as
he
pretended
,
to
execute
a
security
for
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
.
    
<EOS>
This
intended
victim
to
that
villain
's
avarice
,
no
sooner
arrived
in
town
,
full
of
hopes
of
money
to
carry
on
his
cause
,
and
of
agreeably
surprising
his
friend
and
protector
Mr
M
#
#
#
#
with
so
seasonable
and
unexpected
a
reinforcement
,
than
an
unforeseen
difficulty
arose
,
concerning
the
payment
of
G####st####ey
's
six
thousand
pound
bond
.
<EOS>
That
money
was
to
have
been
raised
out
of
the
estate
of
a
lunatic
,
which
could
not
be
done
without
the
leave
of
the
Court
of
Chancery
,
to
whom
an
account
must
have
been
given
of
the
intended
application
of
it
.
<EOS>
While
preparations
were
making
to
rectify
this
omission
,
G####st####ey
immediately
carried
Mr
A####ey
again
into
the
country
,
lest
he
should
happen
to
be
undeceived
by
some
means
or
other
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
mean
time
,
this
wicked
machination
was
providentially
discovered
by
Mr
M####r
,
before
it
could
be
carried
into
execution
,
by
means
of
the
jealousies
that
arose
among
the
conspirators
themselves
;
and
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
confirmed
to
him
by
a
person
whom
the
very
agent
for
the
An####ey
party
had
entrusted
with
the
secret
.
<EOS>
M####r
no
sooner
detected
it
than
he
communicated
his
discovery
to
one
of
Mr
A####ey
's
council
,
a
man
of
great
worth
;
and
immediately
thereupon
,
took
proper
measures
to
defeat
it
.
<EOS>
He
then
found
means
to
lay
open
to
Mr
A####ey
himself
,
the
treacherous
scheme
that
was
laid
for
his
destruction
:
he
was
highly
sensible
of
it
;
and
could
never
afterwards
reflect
on
the
snare
that
he
had
so
unwarily
been
drawn
into
,
and
had
so
narrowly
escaped
,
without
a
mixture
of
horror
,
shame
,
and
gratitude
to
his
deliverer
.
    
<EOS>
The
consummate
assurance
of
the
monsters
who
were
engaged
in
this
plot
,
after
they
had
been
detected
,
and
upbraided
with
their
treachery
,
is
scarce
to
be
parallelled
;
for
they
not
only
owned
the
fact
of
spiriting
Mr
A####ey
away
,
in
the
manner
abovementioned
,
but
justified
their
doing
it
,
as
tending
to
his
service
.
    
<EOS>
They
also
maintained
,
that
they
had
actually
secured
the
twenty
-
five
thousand
pounds
for
him
,
tho
'
<EOS>
they
never
could
name
any
one
person
who
was
to
have
advanced
the
money
.
<EOS>
No
man
was
more
active
in
this
scheme
than
H####n
;
nor
any
man
more
solicitous
to
keep
Mr
A####ey
up
in
the
false
impressions
he
had
received
,
or
in
projecting
methods
to
ruin
his
protector
,
than
he
.
    
<EOS>
Among
many
other
expedients
for
that
purpose
,
a
most
malicious
attempt
was
made
to
lodge
an
information
against
him
,
for
treasonable
practices
,
with
the
secretary
of
state
,
notwithstanding
the
repeated
proofs
he
had
given
of
his
loyalty
;
and
,
as
a
preparatory
step
to
this
accusation
,
a
letter
,
which
this
traitor
dictated
,
was
copied
by
another
person
,
and
actually
sent
to
the
earl
of
C####d
,
importing
,
that
the
person
who
copied
the
letter
had
an
affair
of
consequence
to
communicate
to
his
lordship
,
if
he
would
appoint
a
time
for
receiving
the
information
.
<EOS>
But
that
person
,
upon
full
conviction
of
the
villany
of
the
scheme
,
absolutely
refused
to
proceed
further
in
it
;
so
that
his
malice
once
more
proved
abortive
:
and
before
he
had
time
to
execute
any
other
contrivance
of
the
same
nature
,
he
was
imprisoned
in
this
very
jail
for
debt
.
    
<EOS>
Here
,
finding
his
creditors
inexorable
,
and
himself
destitute
of
all
other
resource
,
he
made
application
to
the
very
man
whom
he
had
injured
in
such
an
outrageous
manner
,
set
forth
his
deplorable
case
in
the
most
pathetic
terms
,
and
intreated
him
,
with
the
most
abject
humility
,
to
use
his
influence
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
The
distress
of
this
varlet
immediately
disarmed
M####r
of
his
resentment
,
and
even
excited
his
compassion
;
and
,
without
sending
any
answer
to
his
remonstrances
,
he
interceded
for
him
with
his
creditors
:
and
the
person
to
whom
he
was
chiefly
indebted
,
refusing
to
release
him
without
security
,
this
unwearied
benefactor
joined
with
the
prisoner
in
a
bond
for
above
one
hundred
and
forty
pounds
,
by
which
he
obtained
his
release
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
no
sooner
discharged
,
however
,
than
he
entered
into
fresh
combinations
with
G####y
and
others
,
in
order
to
thwart
his
deliverer
in
his
schemes
of
raising
money
,
and
otherwise
to
distress
and
deprive
him
of
liberty
;
for
which
purpose
,
no
art
or
industry
(
perjury
not
excepted
)
hath
been
spared
.
<EOS>
And
,
what
is
still
more
extraordinary
,
this
perfidious
monster
having
found
money
to
take
up
the
bond
,
in
consequence
of
which
he
regained
his
freedom
,
hath
procured
a
writ
against
M####r
,
upon
that
very
obligation
;
and
taken
assignments
to
some
other
debts
of
that
gentleman
,
with
the
same
christian
intention
.
<EOS>
But
,
hitherto
,
he
hath
,
by
surprising
sagacity
and
unshaken
resolution
,
baffled
all
their
infernal
contrivances
,
and
retorted
some
of
their
machinations
on
their
own
heads
:
and
at
this
time
,
when
he
is
supposed
by
some
,
and
represented
by
others
,
as
under
the
circumstances
of
oblivion
and
despondence
,
he
proceeds
in
his
design
with
the
utmost
calmness
and
intrepidity
,
meditating
schemes
,
and
ripening
measures
,
that
will
one
day
confound
his
enemies
,
and
attract
the
notice
and
admiration
of
mankind
.

<EOS>
Peregrine
,
having
thanked
the
priest
for
his
obliging
information
,
expressed
his
surprize
at
the
scandalous
inattention
of
the
world
to
an
affair
of
such
importance
;
observing
,
that
,
by
such
inhuman
neglect
,
this
unfortunate
young
gentleman
,
Mr
A####ey
,
was
absolutely
deprived
of
all
the
benefit
of
society
;
the
sole
end
of
which
is
,
to
protect
the
rights
,
redress
the
grievances
,
and
promote
the
happiness
of
individuals
.
<EOS>
As
for
the
character
of
M####r
,
he
said
it
was
so
romantically
singular
in
all
its
circumstances
,
that
,
tho
'
other
motives
were
wanting
,
curiosity
alone
would
induce
him
to
seek
his
acquaintance
:
but
he
did
not
at
all
wonder
at
the
ungrateful
returns
which
had
been
made
to
his
generosity
by
H####n
,
and
many
others
,
whom
he
had
served
in
a
manner
that
few
,
besides
himself
,
would
have
done
;
for
he
had
been
long
convinced
of
the
truth
conveyed
in
these
lines
of
a
celebrated
Italian
author
:

The
story
which
you
have
related
of
that
young
gentleman
,
(
said
he
)
bears
a
very
strong
resemblance
to
the
fate
of
a
Spanish
nobleman
,
as
it
was
communicated
to
me
by
one
of
his
own
intimate
friends
at
Paris
.
<EOS>
The
countess
d'Alvarez
died
immediately
after
the
birth
of
a
son
,
and
the
husband
surviving
her
but
three
years
,
the
child
was
left
sole
heir
to
his
honours
and
estate
,
under
the
guardianship
of
his
uncle
,
who
had
a
small
fortune
and
a
great
many
children
.
<EOS>
This
inhuman
relation
,
coveting
the
wealth
of
his
infant
ward
,
formed
a
design
against
the
life
of
the
helpless
orphan
,
and
trusted
the
execution
of
it
to
his
valet
de
chambre
,
who
was
tempted
to
undertake
the
murder
by
the
promise
of
a
considerable
reward
.
    
<EOS>
He
accordingly
stabbed
the
boy
with
a
knife
,
in
three
different
places
,
on
the
right
side
of
his
neck
:
<EOS>
but
,
as
he
was
not
used
to
such
barbarous
attempts
,
his
hand
failed
in
the
performance
;
and
he
was
seized
with
such
remorse
,
that
,
perceiving
the
wounds
were
not
mortal
,
he
carried
the
hapless
victim
to
the
house
of
a
surgeon
,
by
whose
care
they
were
healed
:
and
in
the
mean
time
,
that
he
might
not
forfeit
his
recompence
,
found
means
to
persuade
his
employer
,
that
his
orders
were
performed
.
<EOS>
A
bundle
being
made
up
for
the
purpose
,
was
publickly
interred
as
the
body
of
the
child
,
who
was
said
to
have
been
suddenly
carried
off
by
a
convulsion
;
and
the
uncle
,
without
opposition
,
succeeded
to
his
honours
and
estate
.
<EOS>
The
boy
being
cured
of
his
hurts
,
was
,
about
the
age
of
six
,
delivered
,
with
a
small
sum
of
money
,
to
a
merchant
just
embarking
for
Turkey
;
who
was
given
to
understand
,
that
he
was
the
bastard
of
a
man
of
quality
;
and
that
,
for
family
reasons
,
it
was
necessary
to
conceal
his
birth
.
    
<EOS>
While
the
unfortunate
orphan
remained
in
this
deplorable
state
of
bondage
,
all
the
children
of
the
usurper
died
one
after
another
;
and
he
himself
being
taken
dangerously
ill
,
attributed
all
his
afflictions
to
the
just
judgment
of
God
,
and
communicated
his
anxiety
on
that
subject
to
the
valet
de
chambre
,
who
had
been
employed
in
the
murder
of
his
nephew
.
<EOS>
That
domestic
,
in
order
to
quiet
his
master
's
conscience
,
and
calm
the
perturbation
of
his
spirits
,
confessed
what
he
had
done
,
and
gave
him
hopes
of
still
finding
the
boy
,
by
dint
of
industry
and
expence
.
    
<EOS>
The
unhappy
child
being
the
only
hope
of
the
family
of
Alvarez
,
the
uncle
immediately
ordered
a
minute
inquiry
to
be
set
on
foot
;
in
consequence
of
which
he
was
informed
,
that
the
orphan
had
been
sold
to
a
Turk
,
who
had
afterwards
transferred
him
to
an
English
merchant
,
by
whom
he
was
conveyed
to
London
.
    
<EOS>
An
express
was
immediately
dispatched
to
this
capital
,
where
he
understood
that
the
unhappy
exile
had
,
in
consideration
of
his
faithful
services
,
been
bound
apprentice
to
a
French
barber
-
surgeon
;
and
after
he
had
sufficiently
qualified
himself
in
that
profession
,
been
received
into
the
family
of
the
count
de
Gallas
,
at
that
time
the
emperor
's
embassador
at
the
court
of
London
.
<EOS>
From
the
house
of
this
nobleman
,
he
was
traced
into
the
service
of
count
d'Oberstorf
,
where
he
had
married
his
lady
's
chamber
-
maid
,
and
then
gone
to
settle
as
a
surgeon
in
Bohemia
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
course
of
these
inquiries
,
several
years
elapsed
;
his
uncle
,
who
was
very
much
-
attached
to
the
house
of
Austria
,
lived
at
Barcelona
,
when
the
father
of
this
empress
queen
resided
in
that
city
,
and
lent
him
a
very
considerable
sum
of
money
in
the
most
pressing
emergency
of
his
affairs
:
and
when
that
prince
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
Germany
,
the
old
count
finding
his
end
approaching
,
sent
his
father
confessor
to
his
majesty
,
with
a
circumstantial
account
of
the
barbarity
he
had
practised
against
his
nephew
,
for
which
he
implored
forgiveness
,
and
begg'd
he
would
give
orders
,
that
the
orphan
,
when
found
,
should
inherit
the
dignities
and
fortune
which
he
had
unjustly
usurped
.
    
<EOS>
His
majesty
assured
the
old
man
,
that
he
might
make
himself
easy
on
that
score
,
and
ordered
the
confessor
to
follow
him
to
Vienna
,
immediately
after
the
count
's
death
,
in
order
to
assist
his
endeavours
in
finding
out
the
injured
heir
.
    
<EOS>
The
priest
did
not
fail
to
yield
obedience
to
this
command
:
he
informed
himself
of
certain
natural
marks
on
the
young
count
's
body
,
which
were
known
to
the
nurse
and
women
who
attended
him
in
his
infancy
;
and
,
with
a
gentleman
whom
the
emperor
ordered
to
accompany
him
,
set
out
for
Bohemia
,
where
he
soon
found
the
object
of
his
inquiry
,
in
the
capacity
of
major
domo
to
a
nobleman
of
that
country
,
he
having
quitted
his
profession
of
surgery
for
that
office
.
    
<EOS>
He
was
not
a
little
surprized
,
when
he
found
himself
circumstantially
catechised
about
the
particulars
of
his
life
,
by
persons
commissioned
for
that
purpose
by
the
emperor
.
<EOS>
He
told
them
,
that
he
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
his
own
birth
,
though
he
had
been
informed
,
during
his
residence
in
Turkey
,
that
he
was
the
bastard
of
a
Spanish
grandee
,
and
gave
them
a
minute
detail
of
the
pilgrimage
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
This
information
agreeing
with
the
intelligence
which
the
priest
had
already
received
,
and
being
corroborated
by
the
marks
upon
his
body
,
and
the
very
scars
of
the
wounds
which
had
been
inflicted
upon
him
in
his
infancy
,
the
confessor
,
without
further
hesitation
,
saluted
him
by
the
name
of
count
d'Alvarez
,
grandee
of
Spain
,
and
explained
the
whole
mystery
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
If
he
was
agreeably
amazed
at
this
explanation
,
the
case
was
otherwise
with
his
wife
,
who
thought
herself
in
great
danger
of
being
abandoned
by
an
husband
of
such
high
rank
;
but
he
immediately
dispelled
her
apprehension
,
by
assuring
her
,
that
as
she
had
shared
in
his
adversity
,
she
should
also
partake
of
his
good
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
He
set
out
immediately
for
Vienna
,
to
make
his
acknowledgements
to
the
emperor
,
who
favoured
him
with
a
very
gracious
reception
,
promised
to
use
his
influence
,
so
that
he
might
enjoy
the
honours
and
estate
of
his
family
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
acknowledged
himself
his
debtor
for
four
hundred
thousand
florins
,
which
he
had
borrowed
from
his
uncle
.
<EOS>
He
threw
himself
at
the
feet
of
his
august
protector
,
expressed
the
most
grateful
sense
of
his
goodness
,
and
begg'd
he
might
be
permitted
to
settle
in
some
of
his
imperial
majesty
's
dominions
.
    
<EOS>
This
request
was
immediately
granted
;
he
was
allowed
to
purchase
land
in
any
part
of
the
hereditary
dominions
of
the
house
of
Austria
,
to
the
amount
of
the
sum
I
have
mentioned
;
and
made
choice
of
the
country
of
Ratibor
in
Silesia
,
where
,
in
all
probability
,
he
still
resides
.
"
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
had
scarce
finished
this
narrative
,
when
he
perceived
<EOS>
Mr
M####r
slip
something
into
the
hand
of
the
young
man
with
whom
he
had
been
conversing
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
and
rise
up
from
the
table
,
in
order
to
take
his
leave
.
<EOS>
He
at
once
understood
the
meaning
of
this
conveyance
,
and
longed
for
an
opportunity
to
be
acquainted
with
such
a
rare
instance
of
primitive
benevolence
;
but
the
consciousness
of
his
present
situation
hindered
him
from
making
any
advance
,
that
might
be
construed
into
forwardness
or
presumption
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
CVII
<EOS>
He
is
surprised
with
the
appearance
of
Hatchway
and
Pipes
,
who
take
up
their
habitation
in
his
neighbourhood
,
contrary
to
his
inclination
and
express
desire
.
   
<EOS>
Being
now
regularly
initiated
in
the
mysteries
of
the
Fleet
,
and
reconciled
in
some
measure
to
the
customs
of
the
place
,
he
began
to
bear
the
edge
of
reflection
without
wincing
;
and
thinking
it
would
be
highly
imprudent
in
him
to
defer
,
any
longer
,
the
purposes
by
which
only
he
could
enjoy
any
ease
and
satisfaction
in
his
confinement
,
he
resolved
to
resume
his
task
of
translating
,
and
every
week
compose
an
occasional
paper
,
by
way
of
revenge
upon
the
minister
,
against
whom
he
had
denounced
eternal
war
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
locked
himself
up
in
his
chamber
,
and
went
to
work
with
great
eagerness
and
application
;
when
he
was
interrupted
by
a
ticket
-
porter
,
who
,
putting
a
letter
in
his
hand
,
vanished
in
a
moment
,
before
he
had
time
to
peruse
the
contents
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
opening
the
billet
,
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
a
bank
-
note
for
fifty
pounds
,
inclosed
in
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
;
and
having
exercised
his
memory
and
penetration
on
the
subject
of
this
unexpected
windfall
,
had
just
concluded
,
that
it
could
come
from
no
other
than
the
lady
who
had
so
kindly
visited
him
a
few
days
before
,
when
his
ears
were
suddenly
invaded
by
the
well
-
known
sound
of
that
whistle
which
always
hung
about
the
neck
of
Pipes
,
as
a
memorial
of
his
former
occupation
;
and
this
tune
being
performed
,
he
heard
the
noise
of
a
wooden
leg
ascending
the
stair
;
upon
which
he
opened
his
door
,
and
beheld
his
friend
Hatchway
,
with
his
old
ship
-
mate
at
his
back
.
    
<EOS>
After
a
cordial
shake
of
the
hand
,
with
the
usual
salutation
of
"
What
cheer
,
cousin
Pickle
?
"
honest
Jack
seated
himself
without
ceremony
;
and
casting
his
eyes
around
the
apartment
,
"
Split
my
topstay
-
sail
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
,
with
an
arch
sneer
)
<EOS>
you
have
got
into
a
snug
birth
,
cousin
.
<EOS>
Here
you
may
sit
all
weathers
,
without
being
turned
out
to
take
your
watch
,
and
no
fear
of
the
ship
's
dragging
her
anchor
.
<EOS>
You
ha'n't
much
room
to
spare
,
'
tis
true
:
an
'
I
had
known
as
how
you
stowed
so
close
,
Tom
should
have
slung
my
own
hammock
for
you
,
and
then
you
mought
have
knocked
down
this
great
lubberly
hurricane
house
.
<EOS>
But
,
mayhap
,
you
turn
in
double
,
and
so
you
do
n't
chuse
to
trust
yourself
and
your
doxy
to
a
clue
and
canvas
.
<EOS>
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
bore
his
jokes
with
great
good
-
humour
,
rallied
him
in
his
turn
about
the
dairy
-
maid
at
the
garrison
,
enquired
about
his
friends
in
the
country
,
asked
if
he
had
been
to
visit
his
niece
,
and
,
finally
,
expressed
a
desire
of
knowing
the
cause
of
his
journey
to
London
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
satisfied
his
curiosity
in
all
these
particulars
;
and
,
in
answer
to
the
last
question
,
observed
,
that
understanding
,
from
the
information
of
Pipes
,
that
he
was
land
-
locked
,
he
had
come
from
the
country
in
order
to
tow
him
into
the
offing
.
<EOS>
"
I
know
not
how
the
wind
sits
(
said
he
)
;
but
if
so
be
,
as
three
thousand
pounds
will
bring
you
clear
of
the
cape
,
say
the
word
,
and
you
sha
n't
lie
wind
-
bound
another
glass
,
for
want
of
the
money
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
was
an
offer
which
few
people
,
in
our
hero
's
situation
,
would
have
altogether
refused
;
especially
as
he
had
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
,
that
,
far
from
being
a
vain
,
unmeaning
compliment
,
it
was
the
genuine
tribute
of
friendship
,
which
the
lieutenant
would
have
willingly
,
ay
and
with
pleasure
,
paid
.
<EOS>
Nevertheless
,
Peregrine
peremptorily
refused
his
assistance
,
tho
'
not
without
expressing
himself
in
terms
of
acknowledgment
suitable
to
the
occasion
;
and
told
him
,
it
would
be
time
enough
to
make
use
of
his
generosity
,
when
he
should
find
himself
destitute
of
all
other
resource
.
<EOS>
Jack
employed
all
his
rhetorick
,
with
a
view
of
persuading
him
to
take
this
opportunity
to
procure
his
own
enlargement
;
and
,
finding
his
arguments
ineffectual
,
insisted
upon
his
accepting
an
immediate
supply
for
his
necessary
occasions
;
swearing
,
with
great
vehemence
,
that
he
would
never
return
to
the
garison
,
unless
he
would
put
him
upon
the
footing
of
any
other
tenant
,
and
receive
his
rent
accordingly
.
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
as
positively
swore
,
that
he
never
would
consider
him
in
that
light
;
<EOS>
remonstrating
,
that
he
had
long
ago
settled
the
house
upon
him
for
life
,
as
a
pledge
of
his
own
esteem
,
as
well
as
in
conformity
with
the
commodore
's
desire
;
and
beseeching
him
to
return
to
his
usual
avocations
,
protested
that
,
if
ever
his
situation
should
subject
him
to
the
necessity
of
borrowing
from
his
friends
,
Mr
Hatchway
should
be
the
first
man
to
whom
he
would
apply
himself
for
succour
.
    
<EOS>
To
convince
him
that
this
was
not
the
case
at
present
,
he
produced
the
bank
-
note
,
which
he
had
received
in
the
letter
,
together
with
his
own
ready
money
;
and
mentioned
some
other
funds
,
which
he
invented
extempore
,
in
order
to
amuse
the
lieutenant
's
concern
.
<EOS>
In
the
close
of
this
expostulation
,
he
desired
Pipes
to
conduct
Mr
Hatchway
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
where
he
might
entertain
himself
with
the
newspapers
for
half
an
hour
;
during
which
he
would
put
on
his
cloaths
,
and
bespeak
something
for
dinner
,
that
they
might
enjoy
each
other
's
company
,
as
long
as
his
occasions
would
permit
him
to
stay
in
that
place
.
    
<EOS>
The
two
sailors
were
no
sooner
gone
,
than
he
took
up
the
pen
,
and
wrote
the
following
letter
,
in
which
he
inclosed
the
bank
-
note
,
to
his
generous
benefactress
:
    
Madam
,
Your
humanity
is
not
more
ingenious
than
my
suspicion
.
<EOS>
In
vain
you
attempt
to
impose
upon
me
by
an
act
of
generosity
,
which
no
person
upon
earth
,
but
your
ladyship
,
is
capable
of
committing
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
your
name
was
not
subscribed
on
the
paper
,
your
sentiments
were
fully
displayed
in
the
contents
,
which
I
must
beg
leave
to
restore
,
with
the
same
sense
of
gratitude
,
and
for
the
same
reasons
I
expressed
,
when
last
I
had
the
honour
to
converse
with
you
upon
this
subject
.
<EOS>
Tho
'
I
am
deprived
of
my
liberty
,
by
the
villainy
and
ingratitude
of
mankind
,
I
am
not
yet
destitute
of
the
other
conveniencies
of
life
;
and
,
therefore
,
beg
to
be
excused
from
incurring
an
unnecessary
addition
to
that
load
of
obligation
you
have
already
laid
upon
,
 
<EOS>
Madam
,
Your
ladyship
's
most
devoted
,
Humble
servant
,
Peregrine
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
Having
dressed
himself
,
and
repaired
to
the
place
of
appointment
,
he
dispatched
this
epistle
by
the
hands
of
Pipes
,
who
was
ordered
to
leave
it
at
her
ladyship
's
house
,
without
staying
for
an
answer
;
and
in
the
mean
time
gave
directions
for
dinner
,
which
he
and
his
friend
Hatchway
ate
very
chearfully
in
his
own
apartment
,
after
he
had
entertained
him
with
a
sight
of
all
the
curiosities
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
During
their
repast
,
Jack
repeated
his
kind
offers
to
our
adventurer
,
who
declined
them
with
his
former
obstinacy
,
and
begged
he
might
be
no
more
importuned
on
that
subject
:
but
,
if
he
insisted
upon
giving
some
fresh
proofs
of
his
friendship
,
he
might
have
an
opportunity
of
exhibiting
it
in
taking
Pipes
under
his
care
and
protection
;
for
nothing
affected
him
so
much
as
his
inability
to
provide
for
such
a
faithful
adherent
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
desired
he
would
give
himself
no
trouble
upon
that
score
;
he
being
,
of
his
own
accord
,
perfectly
well
disposed
to
befriend
his
old
ship
-
mate
,
who
should
never
want
,
while
he
had
a
shilling
to
spare
.
<EOS>
But
he
began
to
drop
some
hints
of
an
intention
to
fix
his
quarters
in
the
Fleet
,
observing
,
that
the
air
seemed
to
be
very
good
in
that
place
,
and
that
he
was
tired
of
living
in
the
country
.
<EOS>
What
he
said
did
not
amount
to
a
plain
declaration
,
and
therefore
Peregrine
did
not
answer
it
as
such
,
tho
'
he
perceived
his
drift
;
and
took
an
opportunity
of
describing
the
inconveniences
of
the
place
,
in
such
a
manner
,
as
he
hoped
would
deter
him
from
putting
such
an
extravagant
plan
in
execution
.
    
<EOS>
This
expedient
,
however
,
far
from
answering
the
end
proposed
,
had
a
quite
contrary
effect
,
and
furnished
Hatchway
with
an
argument
against
his
own
unwillingness
to
quit
such
a
disagreeable
place
.
<EOS>
And
,
in
all
probability
,
Jack
would
have
been
more
explicit
,
with
regard
to
the
scheme
he
had
proposed
,
if
the
conversation
had
not
been
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
Cadwallader
,
who
never
failed
in
the
performance
of
his
diurnal
visit
.
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
conjecturing
that
this
stranger
might
have
some
private
business
with
his
friend
,
quitted
the
apartment
,
on
pretence
of
taking
a
turn
:
and
meeting
Pipes
at
the
door
,
desired
his
company
to
the
Bear
,
by
which
name
the
open
space
is
distinguished
;
where
,
during
a
course
of
perambulation
,
these
two
companions
held
a
council
upon
Pickle
:
in
consequence
of
which
it
was
determined
,
since
he
obstinately
persisted
to
refuse
their
assistance
,
that
they
should
take
lodgings
in
his
neighbourhood
,
with
a
view
of
being
at
hand
to
minister
unto
his
occasions
,
in
spite
of
his
false
delicacy
,
according
to
the
emergency
of
his
affairs
.
    
<EOS>
This
resolution
being
taken
,
they
consulted
the
bar
-
keeper
of
the
coffee
-
house
about
lodging
,
and
she
directed
them
to
the
warden
;
to
whom
the
lieutenant
,
in
his
great
wisdom
,
represented
himself
as
a
kinsman
to
Peregrine
,
who
,
rather
than
leave
that
young
gentleman
by
himself
to
the
unavoidable
discomforts
of
a
prison
,
was
inclined
to
keep
him
company
,
'
till
such
time
as
his
affairs
could
be
put
in
order
.
    
<EOS>
This
measure
he
the
more
anxiously
desired
to
take
,
because
the
prisoner
was
sometimes
subject
to
a
disordered
imagination
,
upon
which
occasion
he
stood
in
need
of
extraordinary
attendance
;
and
therefore
he
(
the
lieutenant
)
intreated
the
warden
to
accommodate
him
with
a
lodging
for
himself
and
his
servant
,
for
which
he
was
ready
to
make
any
reasonable
acknowledgment
.
<EOS>
The
warden
,
who
was
a
sensible
and
humane
man
,
could
not
help
applauding
his
resolution
;
and
several
rooms
being
at
that
time
unoccupied
,
he
put
him
immediately
in
possession
of
a
couple
,
which
were
forthwith
prepared
for
his
reception
.
    
<EOS>
This
affair
being
settled
to
his
satisfaction
,
he
dispatched
Pipes
for
his
portmanteau
;
and
returning
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
sound
Peregrine
,
with
whom
he
spent
the
remaining
part
of
the
evening
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
taking
it
for
granted
that
he
proposed
to
set
out
for
the
garison
next
day
,
wrote
a
memorandum
of
some
books
which
he
had
left
in
that
habitation
,
and
which
he
now
desired
Jack
to
send
up
to
town
by
the
waggon
,
directed
for
Mr
Crabtree
;
and
cautioned
him
against
giving
the
least
hint
of
his
misfortune
in
the
neighbourhood
,
that
it
might
remain
,
as
long
as
possible
,
concealed
from
the
knowledge
of
his
sister
,
(
who
,
he
knew
,
would
afflict
herself
immoderately
at
the
news
)
nor
reach
the
ears
of
the
rest
of
his
family
,
who
would
exult
and
triumph
over
his
distress
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
listened
to
his
injunctions
with
great
attention
,
and
promised
to
demean
himself
accordingly
:
then
the
discourse
shifted
to
an
agreeable
recapitulation
of
the
merry
scenes
they
had
formerly
acted
together
;
and
the
evening
being
pretty
far
advanced
,
Peregrine
,
with
seeming
reluctance
,
told
him
that
the
gates
of
the
Fleet
would
in
a
few
minutes
be
shut
for
the
night
,
and
that
there
was
an
absolute
necessity
for
his
withdrawing
to
his
lodging
.
    
<EOS>
Jack
replied
,
that
he
could
not
think
of
parting
with
him
so
soon
,
after
such
a
long
separation
;
and
that
he
was
determined
to
stay
with
him
an
hour
or
two
longer
,
if
he
should
be
obliged
to
take
up
his
lodging
in
the
streets
.
<EOS>
Pickle
,
rather
than
disoblige
his
guest
,
indulged
him
in
his
desire
,
and
resolved
to
give
him
a
share
of
his
own
bed
.
<EOS>
A
pair
of
chickens
and
'
sparagus
were
bespoken
for
supper
,
at
which
Pipes
attended
with
an
air
of
internal
satisfaction
;
and
the
bottle
was
bandied
about
in
a
jovial
manner
'
till
midnight
,
when
the
lieutenant
rose
up
to
take
his
leave
,
observing
,
that
being
fatigued
with
riding
,
he
was
inclined
to
turn
-
in
.
<EOS>
Pipes
,
upon
this
intimation
,
produced
a
lanthorn
ready
lighted
;
and
<EOS>
Jack
,
shaking
his
entertainer
by
the
hand
,
wished
him
good
-
night
,
and
promised
to
visit
him
again
betimes
in
the
morning
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
imagining
that
this
behaviour
proceeded
from
the
wine
,
which
he
had
plentifully
drank
,
told
him
,
that
if
he
was
disposed
to
sleep
,
his
bed
was
ready
prepared
in
the
room
,
and
ordered
his
attendant
to
undress
his
master
;
upon
which
Mr
Hatchway
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
had
no
occasion
to
incommode
his
friend
,
having
already
provided
a
lodging
for
himself
:
and
the
young
gentleman
demanding
an
explanation
,
he
frankly
owned
what
he
had
done
,
saying
,
"
You
gave
me
such
a
dismal
account
of
the
place
,
that
I
could
not
think
of
leaving
you
in
it
without
company
.
"
    
<EOS>
Our
young
gentleman
,
who
was
naturally
impatient
of
benefits
,
and
foresaw
that
this
uncommon
instance
of
Hatchway
's
friendship
would
encroach
upon
the
plan
which
he
had
formed
for
his
own
subsistence
,
by
engrossing
his
time
and
attention
,
so
as
that
he
should
not
be
able
to
prosecute
his
labours
;
closeted
the
lieutenant
next
day
,
and
demonstrated
to
him
the
folly
and
ill
consequences
of
the
step
he
had
taken
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
the
world
in
general
would
look
upon
it
as
the
effect
of
mere
madness
;
and
,
if
his
relations
were
so
disposed
,
they
might
make
it
the
foundation
of
a
statute
of
lunacy
against
him
;
that
his
absence
from
the
garison
must
be
a
very
great
detriment
to
his
private
affairs
;
and
,
lastly
,
that
his
presence
in
the
Fleet
would
be
a
very
great
hindrance
to
Pickle
himself
,
whose
hope
of
regaining
his
liberty
altogether
depended
upon
his
being
detached
from
all
company
and
interruption
.
    
<EOS>
To
these
remonstrances
Jack
replied
,
that
,
as
to
the
opinion
of
the
world
,
it
was
no
more
to
him
than
a
rotten
net
-
line
;
and
if
his
relations
had
a
mind
to
have
his
upper
works
condemned
,
he
did
not
doubt
<EOS>
but
he
should
be
able
to
stand
the
survey
,
without
being
declared
unfit
for
service
;
that
he
had
no
affairs
at
the
garison
,
but
such
as
would
keep
cold
;
and
with
regard
to
Pickle
's
being
interrupted
by
his
presence
,
he
gave
him
his
word
,
that
he
would
never
come
along
-
side
of
him
,
except
when
he
should
give
him
the
signal
for
holding
discourse
.
<EOS>
In
conclusion
,
he
signified
his
resolution
to
stay
where
he
was
,
at
all
events
,
without
making
himself
accountable
to
any
person
whatsoever
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
seeing
him
determined
,
desisted
from
any
further
importunity
;
resolving
,
however
,
to
tire
him
out
of
his
plan
by
reserve
and
supercilious
neglect
;
for
he
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
being
so
notoriously
obliged
by
any
person
upon
earth
.
<EOS>
With
this
view
he
quitted
the
lieutenant
,
upon
some
slight
pretence
;
after
having
told
him
,
that
he
could
not
have
the
pleasure
of
his
company
at
dinner
,
because
he
was
engaged
with
a
particular
club
of
his
fellow
-
prisoners
.
    
<EOS>
Jack
was
a
stranger
to
the
punctilios
of
behaviour
,
and
therefore
did
not
take
this
declaration
amiss
;
but
had
immediate
recourse
to
the
advice
of
his
counsellor
Mr
Pipes
,
who
proposed
that
he
should
go
to
the
coffee
-
house
and
kitchen
,
and
give
the
people
to
understand
that
he
would
pay
for
all
such
liquor
and
provisions
as
Mr
Pickle
should
order
to
be
sent
to
his
own
lodging
.
<EOS>
This
expedient
was
immediately
practised
;
and
,
as
there
was
no
credit
in
the
place
,
Hatchway
deposited
a
sum
of
money
,
by
way
of
security
,
to
the
cook
and
the
vintner
,
intimating
,
that
there
was
a
necessity
for
taking
that
method
of
befriending
his
cousin
Peregrine
,
who
was
subject
to
strange
whims
,
that
rendered
it
impossible
to
serve
him
any
other
way
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
these
insinuations
,
it
was
that
same
day
rumoured
about
the
Fleet
,
that
Mr
Pickle
was
an
unhappy
gentleman
disordered
in
his
understanding
,
and
that
the
lieutenant
was
his
near
relation
,
who
had
subjected
himself
to
the
inconvenience
of
living
in
a
jail
,
with
the
sole
view
of
keeping
a
strict
eye
over
his
conduct
.
<EOS>
This
report
,
however
,
did
not
reach
the
ears
of
our
hero
till
next
day
,
when
he
sent
one
of
the
runners
of
the
Fleet
,
who
attended
him
,
to
bespeak
and
pay
for
a
couple
of
pullets
,
and
something
else
,
for
dinner
,
to
which
he
had
already
invited
his
friend
Hatchway
,
in
hope
of
being
able
to
persuade
him
to
retire
into
the
country
,
after
he
had
undergone
a
whole
day
's
mortification
in
the
place
.
<EOS>
The
messenger
returned
with
an
assurance
,
that
the
dinner
should
be
made
ready
according
to
his
directions
,
and
restored
the
money
,
observing
that
his
kinsman
had
paid
for
what
was
bespoke
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
equally
surprized
and
disgusted
at
this
information
,
and
resolved
to
chide
the
lieutenant
severely
,
for
his
unseasonable
treat
,
which
he
considered
as
a
thing
repugnant
to
his
reputation
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
dispatched
his
attendant
for
wine
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
and
finding
his
credit
bolstered
up
in
that
place
by
the
same
means
,
was
enraged
at
the
presumption
of
Jack
's
friendship
,
and
questioned
the
valet
about
it
,
with
such
manifestation
of
displeasure
,
that
the
fellow
,
afraid
of
disobliging
such
a
good
master
,
frankly
communicated
the
story
which
was
circulated
at
his
expence
.
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
was
so
much
incensed
at
this
piece
of
intelligence
,
that
he
wrote
a
bitter
expostulation
to
the
lieutenant
,
wherein
he
not
only
retracted
his
invitation
,
but
declared
that
he
would
never
converse
with
him
,
while
he
should
remain
within
the
place
.
    
<EOS>
Having
thus
obeyed
the
dictates
of
his
anger
,
he
gave
notice
to
the
cook
,
that
he
should
not
have
occasion
for
what
was
ordered
;
and
repairing
to
the
coffee
-
house
,
told
the
landlord
,
that
whereas
he
understood
the
stranger
with
the
wooden
leg
had
prepossessed
him
and
others
with
ridiculous
notions
,
tending
to
bring
the
sanity
of
his
intellects
in
question
;
and
,
to
confirm
this
imputation
,
had
,
under
the
pretence
of
consanguinity
,
undertaken
to
defray
his
expences
;
he
could
not
help
(
in
justice
to
himself
)
<EOS>
declaring
,
that
the
lame
person
was
,
in
reality
,
<EOS>
the
madman
,
who
had
given
his
keepers
the
slip
;
that
,
therefore
,
he
(
the
landlord
)
would
not
find
his
account
in
complying
with
his
orders
,
and
encouraging
him
to
frequent
his
house
;
and
that
,
for
his
own
part
,
he
would
never
enter
the
door
,
or
favour
him
with
the
least
trifle
of
his
custom
,
if
ever
he
should
,
for
the
future
,
find
himself
anticipated
in
this
payments
by
that
unhappy
lunatic
.
    
<EOS>
The
vintner
was
confounded
at
this
retorted
charge
;
and
,
after
much
perplexity
and
deliberation
,
concluded
,
that
both
parties
were
distracted
;
the
stranger
,
in
paying
a
man
's
debts
against
his
will
,
and
Pickle
,
in
being
offended
at
such
forwardness
of
friendship
.

<EOS>
These
associates
commit
an
assault
upon
Crabtree
,
for
which
they
are
banished
from
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
Peregrine
begins
to
feel
the
effects
of
confinement
.
   
<EOS>
Our
adventurer
having
dined
at
the
ordinary
,
and
in
the
afternoon
retired
to
his
own
apartment
,
as
usual
,
with
his
friend
Cadwallader
;
Hatchway
and
his
associate
,
after
they
had
been
obliged
to
discuss
the
provision
for
which
they
had
paid
,
renewed
their
conference
upon
the
old
subject
;
and
Pipes
giving
his
mess
-
mate
to
understand
,
that
Peregrine
's
chief
confident
was
the
old
deaf
batchelor
,
whom
he
had
seen
at
his
lodging
the
preceding
day
,
Mr
Hatchway
,
in
his
great
penetration
,
discovered
,
that
the
young
gentleman
's
obstinacy
proceeded
from
the
advice
of
the
Misanthrope
,
whom
,
for
that
reason
,
it
was
their
business
to
chastise
.
<EOS>
Pipes
entered
into
this
opinion
the
more
willingly
,
as
he
had
all
along
believed
the
senior
to
be
a
sort
of
wizzard
,
or
some
caco
-
daemon
,
whom
it
was
not
very
creditable
to
be
acquainted
with
.
    
<EOS>
Indeed
,
he
had
been
inspired
with
this
notion
by
the
insinuations
of
Hadgi
,
who
had
formerly
dropped
some
hints
touching
.
<EOS>
Crabtree
's
profound
knowledge
in
the
magic
art
;
mentioning
,
in
particular
,
his
being
possessed
of
the
philosopher
's
stone
;
an
assertion
to
which
Tom
had
given
implicit
credit
,
until
his
master
was
sent
to
prison
for
debt
,
when
he
could
no
longer
suppose
Cadwallader
lord
of
such
a
valuable
secret
,
else
he
would
have
certainly
procured
the
enlargement
of
his
most
intimate
friend
.
    
<EOS>
With
these
sentiments
he
espoused
the
resentment
of
Hatchway
;
and
they
determined
to
seize
the
supposed
conjurer
,
with
the
first
opportunity
,
on
his
return
from
his
visit
to
Peregrine
,
and
,
without
hesitation
,
exercise
upon
him
the
discipline
of
the
pump
.
<EOS>
This
plan
they
would
have
executed
that
same
evening
,
had
not
the
misanthrope
luckily
withdrawn
himself
,
by
accident
,
before
it
was
dark
,
and
even
before
they
had
intelligence
of
his
retreat
.
<EOS>
But
,
next
day
,
they
kept
themselves
upon
the
watch
'
till
he
appeared
,
and
Pipes
lifting
his
hat
,
as
Crabtree
passed
,
"
O
damn
ye
,
old
Dunny
(
said
he
)
,
you
and
I
must
grapple
by
and
by
;
and
,
a'gad
!
<EOS>
I
shall
lie
so
near
your
quarter
,
that
your
ear
-
ports
will
let
in
the
sound
,
tho'f
they
were
double
caulked
with
oakum
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
misanthrope
's
ears
were
not
quite
so
fast
closed
,
but
that
they
received
this
intimation
;
which
,
tho
'
delivered
in
terms
that
he
did
not
well
understand
,
had
such
an
effect
upon
his
apprehension
,
that
he
signified
his
doubts
to
Peregrine
,
observing
,
that
he
did
not
much
like
the
looks
of
that
same
ruffian
with
the
wooden
leg
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
assured
him
,
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
two
sailors
,
who
could
have
no
cause
of
resentment
against
him
;
or
,
if
they
had
,
would
not
venture
to
take
any
step
,
which
they
knew
must
block
up
all
the
avenues
to
that
reconcilement
,
about
which
they
were
so
anxious
;
and
,
moreover
,
give
such
offence
to
the
governor
of
the
place
,
as
would
infallibly
induce
him
to
expel
them
both
from
his
territories
.
    
<EOS>
Notwithstanding
this
assurance
,
the
young
gentleman
was
not
so
confident
of
the
lieutenant
's
discretion
,
as
to
believe
that
Crabtree
's
fears
were
altogether
without
foundation
<EOS>
:
he
forthwith
conjectured
that
Jack
had
taken
umbrage
at
an
intimacy
,
from
which
he
found
himself
excluded
,
and
imputed
his
disgrace
to
the
insinuations
of
Cadwallader
,
whom
,
in
all
likelihood
,
he
intended
to
punish
for
his
supposed
advice
.
<EOS>
He
knew
his
friend
could
sustain
no
great
damage
from
the
lieutenant
's
resentment
,
in
a
place
which
he
could
immediately
alarm
with
his
cries
,
and
therefore
wished
he
might
fall
into
the
snare
,
because
it
would
furnish
him
with
a
pretence
of
complaint
;
in
consequence
of
which
,
the
sailors
would
be
obliged
to
shift
their
quarters
,
so
as
that
he
should
be
rid
of
their
company
,
in
which
he
at
present
could
find
no
enjoyment
.
    
<EOS>
Every
thing
happened
as
he
had
foreseen
;
the
misanthrope
,
in
his
retreat
from
Peregrine
's
chamber
,
was
assaulted
by
Hatchway
and
his
associate
,
who
seized
him
by
the
collar
without
ceremony
,
and
began
to
drag
him
towards
the
pump
,
at
which
they
would
have
certainly
complimented
him
with
a
very
disagreeable
bath
,
had
not
he
exalted
his
voice
in
such
a
manner
,
as
in
a
moment
brought
a
number
of
the
inhabitants
,
and
Pickle
himself
to
his
aid
.
    
<EOS>
The
assailants
would
have
persisted
in
their
design
,
had
the
opposition
been
such
,
as
they
could
have
faced
with
any
possibility
of
success
;
nor
did
they
quit
their
prey
,
before
a
dozen
,
at
least
,
had
come
to
his
rescue
,
and
Peregrine
,
with
a
menacing
aspect
and
air
of
authority
,
commanded
his
old
valet
to
withdraw
:
then
they
thought
proper
to
sheer
off
,
and
betake
themselves
to
close
quarters
,
while
our
hero
accompanied
the
affrighted
Cadwallader
to
the
gate
,
and
exhibited
to
the
warden
a
formal
complaint
against
the
rioters
,
upon
whom
he
retorted
the
charge
of
lunacy
,
which
was
supported
by
the
evidence
of
twenty
persons
,
who
had
been
eye
-
witnesses
of
the
outrage
committed
against
the
old
gentleman
.
    
<EOS>
The
governor
,
in
consequence
of
this
information
,
sent
a
message
to
Mr
Hatchway
,
warning
him
to
move
his
lodging
next
day
,
on
pain
of
being
expelled
;
and
the
lieutenant
contumaciously
refusing
to
comply
with
this
intimation
,
was
in
the
morning
,
while
he
amused
himself
in
walking
upon
the
bear
,
suddenly
surrounded
by
the
constables
of
the
court
,
who
took
him
and
his
adherent
prisoners
,
before
they
were
aware
,
and
delivered
them
into
the
hands
of
the
turn
-
keys
,
by
whom
they
were
immediately
dismissed
,
and
their
baggage
conveyed
to
the
side
of
the
ditch
.
    
<EOS>
This
expulsion
was
not
performed
without
an
obstinate
opposition
on
the
part
of
the
delinquents
,
who
,
had
they
not
been
surprized
,
would
have
set
the
whole
Fleet
at
defiance
,
and
,
in
all
probability
,
acted
divers
tragedies
,
before
they
could
have
been
over
-
powered
.
    
<EOS>
Things
being
circumstanced
as
they
were
,
the
lieutenant
did
not
part
with
his
conductor
,
without
tweaking
his
nose
,
by
way
of
farewel
;
and
Pipes
,
in
imitation
of
such
a
laudable
example
,
communicated
a
token
of
remembrance
,
in
an
application
to
the
sole
eye
of
his
attendant
,
who
,
scorning
to
be
out
-
done
in
this
kind
of
courtesy
,
returned
the
compliment
with
such
good
will
,
that
Tom
's
organ
performed
the
office
of
a
multiplying
glass
.
<EOS>
These
were
mutual
hints
for
stripping
;
and
accordingly
,
each
was
naked
from
the
waist
upwards
in
a
trice
.
<EOS>
A
ring
of
butchers
from
the
market
was
immediately
formed
;
a
couple
of
the
reverend
Flamens
,
who
,
in
morning
-
gowns
,
ply
for
marriages
in
that
quarter
of
the
town
,
constituted
themselves
seconds
and
umpires
of
the
approaching
contest
,
and
the
battle
began
without
further
preparation
.
<EOS>
The
combatants
were
,
in
point
of
strength
and
agility
,
pretty
equally
matched
;
but
the
jailor
had
been
regularly
trained
to
the
art
of
bruising
:
he
had
more
than
once
signalized
himself
in
public
,
for
his
prowess
and
skill
in
this
exercise
,
and
lost
one
eye
upon
the
stage
,
in
the
course
of
his
exploits
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
misfortune
of
which
Pipes
did
not
fail
to
take
the
advantage
:
he
had
already
sustained
several
hard
knocks
upon
his
temples
and
jaws
and
found
it
impracticable
to
smite
his
antagonist
upon
the
victualling
-
office
,
so
dexterously
was
it
defended
against
assault
:
upon
which
he
changed
his
battery
,
and
being
ambi
-
dexter
,
raised
such
a
clatter
upon
the
turnkey
's
blind
side
,
that
this
hero
,
believing
him
left
-
handed
,
converted
his
attention
that
way
,
and
opposed
the
unenlightened
side
of
his
face
to
the
right
-
hand
of
Pipes
,
which
being
thus
unprovided
against
,
slily
bestowed
upon
him
a
peg
under
the
fifth
rib
,
that
in
an
instant
laid
him
senseless
on
the
pavement
,
at
the
feet
of
his
conqueror
,
who
was
congratulated
upon
his
victory
,
not
only
by
his
friend
Hatchway
,
but
also
by
all
the
by
-
standers
,
particularly
the
priest
who
had
espoused
his
cause
,
and
now
invited
the
strangers
to
his
lodging
in
a
neighbouring
alehouse
,
where
they
were
entertained
so
much
to
their
liking
,
that
they
determined
to
seek
no
other
habitation
while
they
should
continue
in
town
:
and
notwithstanding
the
disgrace
and
discouragement
they
had
met
with
,
in
their
endeavours
to
serve
our
adventurer
,
they
were
still
resolved
to
persevere
in
their
good
offices
,
or
,
in
the
vulgar
phrase
,
to
see
him
out
.
    
<EOS>
While
they
settled
themselves
in
this
manner
,
and
acquired
familiar
connexions
round
all
the
purlieus
of
the
ditch
,
Peregrine
found
himself
deprived
of
the
company
of
Cadwallader
,
who
signified
by
letter
,
that
he
did
not
chuse
to
hazard
his
person
again
in
visiting
him
,
while
such
assassins
occupied
the
avenues
through
which
he
must
pass
;
for
he
had
been
at
pains
to
inquire
into
the
motions
of
the
seamen
,
and
informed
himself
exactly
of
the
harbour
in
which
they
were
moored
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
had
been
so
much
accustomed
to
the
conversation
of
Crabtree
,
which
was
altogether
suitable
to
the
singularity
of
his
own
disposition
,
that
he
could
very
ill
afford
to
be
debarred
of
it
at
this
juncture
,
when
almost
every
other
source
of
enjoyment
was
stopped
.
<EOS>
He
was
,
however
,
obliged
to
submit
to
the
hardships
of
his
situation
;
and
as
the
characters
of
his
fellow
-
prisoners
did
not
at
all
improve
upon
him
,
he
was
compelled
to
seek
for
satisfaction
within
himself
.
    
<EOS>
Not
but
that
he
had
an
opportunity
of
conversing
with
some
people
,
who
neither
wanted
sense
,
nor
were
deficient
in
point
of
principle
;
yet
there
appeared
in
the
behaviour
of
them
all
,
without
exception
,
a
certain
want
of
decorum
,
a
squalor
of
sentiment
,
a
sort
of
jailish
cast
contracted
in
the
course
of
confinement
,
which
disgusted
the
delicacy
of
our
hero
's
observation
.
<EOS>
He
,
therefore
,
detached
himself
from
their
parties
as
much
as
he
could
,
without
giving
offence
to
those
among
whom
he
was
obliged
to
live
,
and
resumed
his
labours
with
incredible
eagerness
and
perseverance
,
his
spirits
being
supported
by
the
success
of
some
severe
Philippics
,
which
he
occasionally
published
against
the
author
of
his
misfortune
.
    
<EOS>
Nor
was
his
humanity
unemployed
in
the
vacations
of
his
revenge
<EOS>
:
a
man
must
be
void
of
all
sympathy
and
compassion
,
who
can
reside
among
so
many
miserable
objects
,
without
feeling
an
inclination
to
relieve
their
distress
.
<EOS>
Every
day
almost
presented
to
his
view
such
lamentable
scenes
,
as
were
most
likely
to
attract
his
notice
,
and
engage
his
benevolence
.
<EOS>
Reverses
of
fortune
,
attended
with
the
most
deplorable
circumstances
of
domestic
woe
,
were
continually
intruding
upon
his
acquaintance
;
his
ears
were
invaded
with
the
cries
of
the
hapless
wife
,
who
from
the
enjoyment
of
affluence
and
pleasure
,
was
forced
to
follow
her
husband
to
this
abode
of
wretchedness
and
want
;
his
eyes
were
every
minute
assailed
with
the
naked
and
meagre
appearances
of
hunger
and
cold
;
and
his
fancy
teemed
with
a
thousand
aggravations
of
their
misery
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
situated
,
his
purse
was
never
shut
,
while
his
heart
remained
open
.
<EOS>
Without
reflecting
upon
the
slenderness
of
his
store
,
he
exercised
his
charity
to
all
the
children
of
distress
,
and
acquired
a
popularity
which
,
though
pleasing
,
was
far
from
being
profitable
.
    
<EOS>
In
short
,
his
bounty
kept
no
pace
with
his
circumstances
,
and
in
a
little
time
he
was
utterly
exhausted
.
<EOS>
He
had
recourse
to
his
bookseller
,
from
whom
,
with
great
difficulty
,
be
obtained
a
small
reinforcement
;
and
immediately
relapsed
into
the
same
want
of
retention
.
<EOS>
He
was
conscious
of
his
infirmity
,
and
found
it
incurable
<EOS>
:
he
foresaw
,
that
by
his
own
industry
he
should
never
be
able
to
defray
the
expence
of
these
occasions
;
and
this
reflection
sunk
deep
into
his
mind
:
<EOS>
the
approbation
of
the
public
,
which
he
had
earned
or
might
acquire
,
like
a
cordial
often
repeated
,
began
to
lose
its
effect
upon
his
imagination
;
his
health
suffered
by
his
sedentary
life
and
austere
application
;
his
eye
-
sight
failed
,
his
appetite
forsook
him
,
his
spirits
decayed
;
so
that
he
became
melancholy
,
listless
,
and
altogether
incapable
of
prosecuting
the
only
means
he
had
left
for
his
subsistence
;
and
(
what
did
not
at
all
contribute
to
the
alleviation
of
these
particulars
)
<EOS>
he
was
given
to
understand
by
his
lawyer
,
that
he
had
lost
his
cause
,
and
was
condemned
in
costs
.
<EOS>
Even
this
was
not
the
most
mortifying
piece
of
intelligence
he
received
;
he
at
the
same
time
learn'd
,
that
his
bookseller
was
bankrupt
,
and
his
friend
Crabtree
at
the
point
of
death
.
    
<EOS>
These
were
comfortable
considerations
to
a
youth
of
Peregrine
's
disposition
,
which
was
so
capricious
,
that
the
more
his
misery
increased
,
the
more
haughty
and
inflexible
he
became
.
    
<EOS>
Rather
than
be
beholden
to
Hatchway
,
who
still
hovered
about
the
gate
,
eager
for
an
opportunity
to
assist
him
,
he
chose
to
undergo
the
want
of
almost
every
convenience
of
life
,
and
actually
pledged
his
wearing
-
apparel
to
an
Irish
pawn
-
broker
in
the
Fleet
,
for
money
to
purchase
those
things
,
without
which
he
must
have
absolutely
perished
.
<EOS>
He
was
gradually
irritated
by
his
misfortunes
into
a
rancorous
resentment
against
mankind
in
general
,
and
his
heart
so
alienated
from
the
enjoyments
of
life
,
that
he
did
not
care
how
soon
he
quitted
his
miserable
existence
.
<EOS>
Though
he
had
shocking
examples
of
the
vicissitudes
of
fortune
continually
before
his
eyes
,
he
could
never
be
reconciled
to
the
idea
of
living
like
his
fellow
-
sufferers
,
in
the
most
abject
degree
of
dependance
.
<EOS>
If
he
refused
to
accept
of
favours
from
his
own
allies
and
intimate
friends
,
whom
he
had
formerly
obliged
,
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
he
would
listen
to
proposals
of
that
kind
from
any
of
his
fellow
-
prisoners
,
with
whom
he
had
contracted
acquaintance
:
he
was
even
more
cautious
than
ever
of
incurring
obligations
;
he
now
shunned
his
former
mess
-
mates
,
in
order
to
avoid
disagreeable
tenders
of
friendship
;
and
imagining
that
he
perceived
an
inclination
in
the
clergyman
,
to
learn
the
state
of
his
finances
,
he
discouraged
and
declined
the
explanation
,
and
at
length
secluded
himself
from
all
society
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
CIX
He
receives
an
unexpected
visit
;
and
the
clouds
of
misfortune
begin
to
separate
.
   
<EOS>
While
he
pined
in
this
forlorn
condition
,
with
an
equal
abhorrence
of
the
world
and
himself
,
captain
Gauntlet
arrived
in
town
,
in
order
to
employ
his
interest
for
promotion
in
the
army
;
and
,
in
consequence
of
his
wife
's
particular
desire
,
made
it
his
business
to
inquire
for
Peregrine
,
to
whom
he
longed
to
be
reconciled
,
even
at
the
expence
of
a
slight
submission
.
<EOS>
But
he
could
hear
no
tidings
of
him
,
at
the
place
to
which
he
was
directed
;
and
,
on
the
supposition
that
our
hero
had
gone
to
reside
in
the
country
,
applied
himself
to
his
own
business
,
with
intention
to
renew
his
enquiries
,
after
that
affair
should
be
transacted
.
<EOS>
He
communicated
his
demands
to
his
supposed
patron
,
who
had
assumed
the
merit
of
making
him
a
captain
,
and
been
gratified
with
a
valuable
present
on
that
consideration
;
and
was
cajoled
with
hopes
of
succeeding
in
his
present
aim
,
by
the
same
interest
.
    
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
he
became
acquainted
with
one
of
the
clerks
belonging
to
the
war
office
,
whose
advice
and
assistance
,
he
was
told
,
would
be
a
furtherance
to
his
scheme
;
and
as
he
had
occasion
to
discourse
with
this
gentleman
,
upon
the
circumstances
of
his
expectation
,
he
learned
that
the
nobleman
,
upon
whom
he
depended
,
was
a
person
of
no
consequence
in
the
state
,
and
altogether
incapable
of
assisting
him
in
his
advancement
.
<EOS>
At
the
same
time
,
his
counsellor
expressed
his
surprize
that
captain
Gauntlet
did
not
rather
interest
in
his
cause
<EOS>
the
noble
peer
,
to
whose
good
offices
he
owed
his
last
commission
.
    
<EOS>
This
remark
introduced
an
explanation
,
by
which
Godfrey
discovered
,
to
his
infinite
astonishment
,
the
mistake
in
which
he
had
continued
so
long
,
with
regard
to
his
patron
;
tho
'
he
could
not
divine
the
motive
which
induced
a
nobleman
,
with
whom
he
had
no
acquaintance
or
connection
,
to
interpose
his
influence
in
his
behalf
.
    
<EOS>
Whatsoever
that
might
be
,
he
thought
it
was
his
duty
to
make
his
acknowledgment
;
and
for
that
purpose
,
went
next
morning
to
his
house
,
where
he
was
politely
received
,
and
given
to
understand
,
that
Mr
Pickle
was
the
person
to
whose
friendship
he
was
indebted
for
his
last
promotion
.
    
<EOS>
Inexpressible
were
the
transports
of
gratitude
,
affection
,
and
remorse
,
that
took
possession
of
the
soul
of
Gauntlet
,
when
this
mystery
was
unfolded
.
"
<EOS>
Good
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
,
lifting
up
his
hands
)
<EOS>
have
I
lived
so
long
in
a
state
of
animosity
with
my
benefactor
?
<EOS>
I
intended
to
have
reconciled
myself
to
him
,
at
any
rate
,
before
I
was
sensible
of
this
obligation
;
but
now
I
shall
not
enjoy
a
moment
's
quiet
,
until
I
have
an
opportunity
of
expressing
to
him
my
sense
of
his
heroic
friendship
.
<EOS>
I
presume
,
from
the
nature
of
the
favour
conferred
upon
him
,
in
my
behalf
,
that
Mr
Pickle
is
well
known
to
your
lordship
;
and
I
should
think
myself
extremely
happy
,
if
you
could
inform
me
in
what
part
of
the
country
he
is
to
be
found
:
for
the
person
with
whom
he
lodged
,
some
time
ago
,
could
give
me
no
intelligence
of
his
motions
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
nobleman
,
touched
with
this
instance
of
generous
self
-
denial
in
Peregrine
,
as
well
as
with
the
sensibility
of
his
friend
,
lamented
the
unhappiness
of
our
hero
,
while
he
gave
Gauntlet
to
understand
that
he
had
been
long
disordered
in
his
intellects
,
in
consequence
of
having
squandered
away
his
fortune
;
and
that
his
creditors
had
thrown
him
into
the
Fleet
-
prison
:
but
whether
he
still
continued
in
that
confinement
,
or
was
released
from
his
misfortunes
by
death
,
his
lordship
did
not
know
,
because
he
had
never
enquired
.
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
no
sooner
received
this
intimation
,
than
(
his
blood
boiling
with
grief
and
impatience
)
<EOS>
he
craved
pardon
for
his
abrupt
departure
;
and
quitting
his
informer
on
the
instant
,
reimbarked
in
his
hackney
-
coach
,
and
ordered
himself
to
be
conveyed
directly
to
the
Fleet
.
<EOS>
As
the
vehicle
proceeded
along
one
side
of
the
market
,
he
was
surprised
with
the
appearance
of
Hatchway
and
Pipes
,
who
stood
cheapening
collyflowers
at
a
green
-
stall
,
their
heads
being
cased
in
worsted
night
-
caps
,
half
covered
with
their
hats
,
and
a
short
tobacco
-
pipe
in
the
mouth
of
each
.
<EOS>
He
was
rejoiced
at
sight
of
the
two
seamen
,
which
he
took
for
an
happy
omen
of
finding
his
friend
;
and
,
ordering
the
coachman
to
stop
the
carriage
,
called
to
the
lieutenant
by
his
name
.
<EOS>
Jack
replying
with
an
Hilloah
,
looked
behind
him
,
and
recognizing
the
face
of
his
old
acquaintance
,
ran
up
to
the
coach
with
great
eagerness
,
and
shaking
the
captain
heartily
by
the
hand
,
"
Odd
's
heart
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
'm
glad
<EOS>
thou
ha'st
fallen
in
with
us
<EOS>
:
we
shall
now
be
able
to
find
the
trim
of
the
vessel
,
and
lay
her
about
on
the
other
tack
.
<EOS>
For
my
own
part
,
I
have
had
many
a
consort
in
my
time
,
that
is
,
in
the
way
of
good
-
fellowship
,
and
I
always
made
shift
to
ware
'em
at
one
time
or
another
:
but
this
headstrong
toad
will
neither
obey
the
helm
nor
the
sheet
;
and
,
for
aught
I

<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
conceived
part
of
his
meaning
,
alighted
immediately
;
and
being
conducted
to
the
sailor
's
lodging
,
was
informed
of
every
thing
that
had
passed
between
the
lieutenant
and
Pickle
.
<EOS>
He
,
in
his
turn
,
communicated
to
Jack
the
discovery
which
he
had
made
,
with
regard
to
his
commission
;
at
which
the
other
gave
no
signs
of
surprize
:
but
taking
the
pipe
from
his
mouth
,
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
ye
,
captain
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
that
's
not
the
only
good
turn
you
have
owed
him
.
    
<EOS>
That
same
money
you
received
from
the
commodore
,
as
an
old
debt
,
was
all
a
sham
,
contrived
by
Pickle
for
your
service
;
but
a
'
wool
drive
under
his
bare
poles
,
without
sails
and
rigging
,
or
a
mess
of
provision
on
board
,
rather
than
take
the
same
assistance
from
another
man
.
"
    
<EOS>
Godfrey
was
not
only
amazed
,
but
chagrined
at
the
knowledge
of
this
anecdote
;
which
gave
umbrage
to
his
pride
,
while
it
stimulated
his
desire
of
doing
something
in
return
for
the
obligation
.
<EOS>
He
enquired
into
the
present
circumstances
of
the
prisoner
;
and
understanding
that
he
was
indisposed
,
and
but
indifferently
provided
with
the
common
necessaries
of
life
,
tho
'
still
deaf
to
all
offers
of
assistance
,
began
to
be
extremely
concerned
at
the
account
of
his
savage
obstinacy
and
pride
,
which
would
,
he
feared
,
exclude
him
from
the
privilege
of
relieving
him
in
his
distress
.
<EOS>
However
,
he
resolved
to
leave
no
expedient
untried
,
that
might
have
any
tendency
to
surmount
such
destructive
prejudice
;
and
,
entering
the
jail
,
was
directed
to
the
apartment
of
the
wretched
prisoner
.
<EOS>
He
knocked
softly
at
the
door
,
and
when
it
was
opened
,
started
back
with
horror
and
astonishment
:
<EOS>
the
figure
that
presented
itself
to
his
view
,
was
the
remains
of
his
once
happy
friend
;
but
so
miserably
altered
and
disguised
,
that
his
features
were
scarce
cognizable
.
<EOS>
The
florid
,
the
sprightly
,
the
gay
,
the
elevated
youth
,
was
now
metamorphosed
into
a
wan
,
dejected
,
meagre
,
squalid
spectre
;
the
hollow
-
eyed
representative
of
distemper
,
indigence
and
despair
:
yet
his
eyes
retained
a
certain
ferocity
,
which
threw
a
dismal
gleam
athwart
the
cloudiness
of
his
aspect
,
and
he
,
in
silence
,
viewed
his
old
companion
with
a
look
betokening
confusion
and
disdain
.
    
<EOS>
As
for
Gauntlet
,
he
could
not
,
without
emotion
,
behold
such
a
woful
reverse
of
fate
,
in
a
person
for
whom
he
entertained
the
noblest
sentiments
of
friendship
,
gratitude
and
esteem
:
his
sorrow
was
at
first
too
big
for
utterance
,
and
he
shed
a
flood
of
tears
before
he
could
pronounce
one
word
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
in
spite
of
his
misanthropy
,
could
not
help
being
affected
with
this
uncommon
testimony
of
regard
;
but
he
strove
to
stifle
his
sensations
:
his
brows
contracted
themselves
into
a
severer
frown
,
his
eyes
kindled
into
the
appearance
of
live
coals
;
he
waved
with
his
hand
,
in
signal
for
Godfrey
to
be
gone
,
and
leave
such
a
wretch
as
him
to
the
miseries
of
his
fate
;
and
finding
nature
too
strong
to
be
suppressed
,
uttered
a
deep
groan
,
and
wept
aloud
.
    
<EOS>
The
soldier
,
seeing
him
thus
melted
,
unable
to
restrain
the
strong
impulse
of
his
affection
,
sprung
forwards
,
and
clasping
him
in
his
arms
,
"
My
dearest
friend
,
and
best
benefactor
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
I
am
come
hither
to
humble
myself
for
the
offence
I
was
so
unhappy
as
to
give
,
at
our
last
parting
;
to
beg
a
reconciliation
,
to
thank
you
for
the
ease
and
affluence
I
have
enjoyed
through
your
means
,
and
to
rescue
you
,
in
spite
of
yourself
,
from
this
melancholy
situation
;
of
which
,
but
an
hour
ago
,
I
was
utterly
ignorant
.
<EOS>
Do
not
deny
me
the
satisfaction
of
acquitting
myself
,
in
point
of
duty
and
obligation
.
<EOS>
You
must
certainly
have
had
some
regard
for
a
person
,
in
whose
favour
you
have
exerted
yourself
so
much
;
and
if
any
part
of
that
esteem
remains
,
you
will
not
refuse
him
an
opportunity
of
approving
himself
,
in
some
measure
,
worthy
of
it
.
    
<EOS>
Let
me
not
suffer
the
most
mortifying
of
all
repulses
,
that
of
slighted
friendship
;
but
kindly
sacrifice
your
resentment
and
inflexibility
to
the
request
of
one
,
who
is
at
all
times
ready
to
sacrifice
his
life
for
your
honour
and
advantage
.
<EOS>
If
you
will
not
yield
to
my
intreaties
,
have
some
regard
to
the
wishes
of
my
Sophy
,
who
laid
me
under
the
strongest
injunctions
to
solicit
your
forgiveness
,
even
before
she
knew
how
much
I
was
indebted
to
your
generosity
;
or
,
if
that
consideration
should
be
of
no
weight
,
I
hope
you
will
relax
a
little
for
the
sake
of
poor
Emilia
,
whose
resentment
hath
been
long
subdued
by
her
affection
,
and
who
now
droops
in
secret
at
your
neglect
.
"
    
<EOS>
Every
word
of
this
address
,
delivered
in
the
most
pathetic
manner
,
made
an
impression
upon
the
mind
of
Peregrine
:
he
was
affected
with
the
submission
of
his
friend
,
who
,
in
reality
,
had
given
him
no
just
cause
to
complain
.
<EOS>
He
knew
that
no
ordinary
motive
had
swayed
him
to
a
condescension
,
so
extraordinary
in
a
man
of
his
punctilious
temper
:
he
considered
it
,
therefore
,
as
the
genuine
effect
of
eager
gratitude
and
disinterested
love
,
and
his
heart
began
to
relent
accordingly
.
<EOS>
When
he
heard
himself
conjured
in
the
name
of
the
gentle
Sophy
,
his
obstinacy
was
quite
overcome
;
and
when
Emilia
was
recalled
to
his
remembrance
,
his
whole
frame
underwent
a
violent
agitation
.
<EOS>
He
took
his
friend
by
the
hand
,
with
a
softened
look
;
and
soon
as
he
recovered
the
faculty
of
speech
,
which
had
been
overpowered
in
the
conflict
of
passions
that
transported
him
,
protested
,
that
he
retained
no
vestige
of
animosity
,
but
considered
him
in
the
light
of
an
affectionate
comrade
,
the
ties
of
whose
friendship
,
adversity
could
not
unbind
.
    
<EOS>
He
mentioned
Sophy
in
the
most
respectful
terms
;
spoke
of
Emilia
with
the
most
reverential
awe
,
as
the
object
of
his
inviolable
love
and
veneration
;
but
disclaimed
all
hope
of
ever
more
attracting
her
regard
;
and
excused
himself
from
profiting
by
Godfrey
's
kind
intention
,
declaring
,
with
a
resolute
air
,
that
he
had
broke
off
all
connection
with
mankind
,
and
that
he
impatiently
longed
for
the
hour
of
his
dissolution
,
which
,
if
it
should
not
soon
arrive
by
the
course
of
nature
,
he
was
resolved
to
hasten
with
his
own
hands
,
rather
than
be
exposed
to
the
contempt
,
and
more
intolerable
pity
,
of
a
rascally
world
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
argued
against
this
frantic
determination
with
all
the
vehemence
of
expostulating
friendship
;
but
his
remonstrances
did
not
produce
the
desired
effect
upon
our
desperate
hero
,
who
calmly
refuted
all
his
arguments
,
and
asserted
the
rectitude
of
his
design
from
the
pretended
maxims
of
reason
and
true
philosophy
.
    
<EOS>
While
this
dispute
was
carried
on
with
eagerness
on
one
side
,
and
deliberation
on
the
other
,
a
letter
was
brought
to
Peregrine
,
who
threw
it
carelesly
aside
unopened
,
tho
'
<EOS>
the
superscription
was
in
an
hand
-
writing
to
which
he
was
a
stranger
;
and
,
in
all
probability
,
the
contents
would
never
have
been
perused
,
had
not
Gauntlet
insisted
upon
his
waving
all
ceremony
,
and
reading
it
forthwith
.
<EOS>
Thus
solicited
,
Pickle
unsealed
the
billet
,
which
,
to
his
no
small
surprize
,
contained
the
following
intimation
.
     
<EOS>
Mr
P
Pickle
,
SIR
<EOS>
,
This
comes
to
inform
you
,
that
,
after
many
dangers
and
disappointments
,
I
am
,
by
the
blessing
of
God
,
safely
arrived
in
the
Downs
,
on
board
of
the
Gomberoon
Indiaman
,
having
made
a
tolerable
voyage
;
by
which
I
hope
I
shall
be
enabled
to
repay
,
with
interest
,
the
seven
hundred
pounds
which
I
borrowed
of
you
before
my
departure
from
England
.
<EOS>
I
take
this
opportunity
of
writing
by
our
purser
,
who
goes
express
with
dispatches
for
the
company
,
that
you
may
have
this
satisfactory
notice
,
as
soon
as
possible
,
relating
to
one
whom
I
suppose
you
have
long
given
over
as
lost
.
<EOS>
I
have
inclosed
it
in
a
letter
to
my
broker
,
who
,
I
hope
,
knows
your
address
,
and
will
forward
it
accordingly
:
<EOS>
and
I
am
,
with
respect
,
Sir
,
 
Your
most
humble
servant
,
Benjamin
Chintz
.
    
<EOS>
He
had
no
sooner
taken
a
cursory
view
of
this
agreeable
epistle
,
than
his
countenance
cleared
up
,
and
reaching
it
to
his
friend
,
with
a
smile
,
"
<EOS>
There
(
said
he
)
is
a
more
convincing
argument
,
on
your
side
of
the
question
,
than
all
the
casuists
in
the
universe
can
advance
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
wondering
at
this
observation
,
took
the
paper
,
and
casting
his
eyes
greedily
upon
the
contents
,
congratulated
him
upon
the
receit
of
it
,
with
extravagant
demonstrations
of
joy
:
"
Not
on
account
of
the
sum
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
which
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
would
,
with
pleasure
,
pay
three
times
over
for
your
convenience
and
satisfaction
;
but
because
it
seems
to
have
reconciled
you
to
life
,
and
disposed
your
mind
for
re
-
enjoying
the
comforts
of
society
.
"
    
<EOS>
The
instantaneous
effect
which
this
unexpected
smile
of
fortune
produced
in
the
appearance
of
our
adventurer
,
is
altogether
inconceivable
!
<EOS>
it
plumped
up
his
cheeks
in
a
moment
,
unbended
and
enlightened
every
feature
of
his
face
;
elevated
his
head
,
which
had
begun
to
sink
,
as
it
were
,
between
his
shoulders
;
and
from
a
squeaking
,
dispirited
tone
,
swelled
up
his
voice
to
a
clear
,
manly
accent
.
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
taking
advantage
of
this
favourable
change
,
began
to
regale
him
with
prospects
of
future
success
:
he
reminded
him
of
his
youth
and
qualifications
,
which
were
certainly
designed
for
better
days
than
those
he
had
as
yet
seen
;
he
pointed
out
various
paths
,
by
which
he
might
arrive
at
wealth
and
reputation
;
he
importuned
him
to
accept
of
a
sum
for
his
immediate
occasions
;
and
earnestly
begged
,
that
he
would
allow
him
to
discharge
the
debt
for
which
he
was
confined
:
observing
,
that
Sophy
's
fortune
had
enabled
him
to
exhibit
that
proof
of
his
gratitude
,
without
any
detriment
to
his
affairs
;
and
protesting
,
that
he
should
not
believe
himself
in
possession
of
Mr
Pickle
's
esteem
,
unless
he
was
permitted
to
make
some
such
return
of
good
-
will
to
the
man
,
who
had
not
only
raised
him
from
indigence
and
scorn
to
competence
and
reputable
rank
,
but
also
impowered
him
to
obtain
the
possession
of
an
excellent
woman
,
who
had
filled
up
the
measure
of
his
felicity
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
declared
himself
already
overpaid
for
all
his
good
offices
,
by
the
pleasure
he
enjoyed
in
employing
them
,
and
the
happy
effects
they
had
produced
,
in
the
mutual
satisfaction
of
two
persons
so
dear
to
his
affection
;
and
assured
his
friend
,
that
one
time
or
other
he
would
set
his
conscience
at
ease
,
and
remove
the
scruples
of
his
honour
,
by
having
recourse
to
his
assistance
:
but
,
at
present
,
he
could
not
make
use
of
his
friendship
,
without
giving
just
cause
of
offence
to
honest
Hatchway
,
who
was
prior
to
him
in
point
of
solicitation
,
and
had
manifested
his
attachment
with
surprising
obstinacy
and
perseverance
.

Chapter
CX
   
<EOS>
The
captain
,
with
reluctance
,
yielded
the
preference
in
this
particular
to
Jack
,
who
was
immediately
invited
to
a
conference
,
by
a
note
subscribed
with
Pickle
's
own
hand
.
<EOS>
He
was
found
at
the
prison
-
gate
waiting
for
Gauntlet
,
to
know
the
issue
of
his
negotiation
;
and
no
sooner
received
this
summons
than
he
set
all
his
sails
,
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
his
friend
's
apartment
;
being
admitted
by
the
turnkey
,
in
consequence
of
Peregrine
's
request
,
communicated
by
the
messenger
who
carried
the
billet
.
<EOS>
Pipes
followed
close
in
the
wake
of
his
shipmate
;
and
,
in
a
few
minutes
after
the
note
had
been
dispatched
,
Peregrine
and
Gauntlet
heard
the
sound
of
the
stump
,
ascending
the
wooden
stair
-
case
with
such
velocity
,
that
they
at
first
mistook
it
for
the
application
of
drum
-
sticks
to
the
head
of
an
empty
barrel
.
<EOS>
This
uncommon
speed
,
however
,
was
attended
with
a
misfortune
:
he
chanced
to
overlook
a
small
defect
in
one
of
the
steps
,
and
,
his
prop
plunging
into
a
hole
,
he
fell
backwards
,
to
the
imminent
danger
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
Tom
was
luckily
at
his
back
,
and
sustained
him
in
his
arms
,
so
as
that
he
escaped
without
any
other
damage
than
the
loss
of
his
wooden
leg
,
which
was
snapt
in
the
middle
,
by
the
weight
of
his
body
,
in
falling
:
and
such
was
his
impatience
,
that
he
would
not
give
himself
the
trouble
to
disengage
the
fractured
member
;
but
unbuckling
the
whole
equipage
in
a
trice
,
left
it
sticking
in
the
crevice
,
saying
a
rotten
cable
was
not
worth
heaving
up
,
and
,
in
this
natural
state
of
mutilation
,
hopp'd
into
the
room
with
infinite
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
taking
him
cordially
by
the
hand
,
seated
him
upon
one
side
of
his
bed
;
and
after
having
made
an
apology
for
that
reserve
,
of
which
he
had
so
justly
complained
,
asked
,
if
he
could
conveniently
accommodate
him
with
the
loan
of
twenty
guineas
.
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
without
opening
his
mouth
,
pulled
out
his
purse
;
and
Pipes
,
who
overheard
the
demand
,
applying
the
whistle
to
his
lips
,
performed
a
loud
overture
,
in
token
of
his
joy
.
<EOS>
Matters
being
thus
brought
to
an
accommodation
,
our
hero
told
the
captain
,
that
he
should
be
glad
of
his
company
at
dinner
,
with
their
common
friend
Hatchway
,
if
he
would
in
the
mean
time
leave
him
to
the
ministry
of
Pipes
;
and
the
soldier
went
away
for
the
present
,
in
order
to
pay
a
short
visit
to
his
uncle
,
who
,
at
that
time
,
languished
in
a
declining
state
of
health
,
promising
to
return
at
the
appointed
hour
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
having
survey'd
the
dismal
appearance
of
his
friend
,
could
not
help
being
moved
at
the
spectacle
,
and
began
to
upbraid
him
with
his
obstinate
pride
,
which
(
he
swore
)
was
no
better
than
self
-
murder
.
    
<EOS>
But
the
young
gentleman
interrupted
him
in
the
course
of
his
moralizing
,
by
telling
him
he
had
reasons
for
his
conduct
,
which
,
perhaps
,
he
should
impart
in
due
season
;
but
,
at
present
,
his
design
was
to
alter
that
plan
of
behaviour
,
and
make
himself
some
amends
for
the
misery
he
had
undergone
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
sent
Pipes
to
redeem
his
cloaths
from
the
pawnbroker
's
wardrobe
,
and
bespeak
something
comfortable
for
dinner
.
<EOS>
And
when
Godfrey
came
back
,
he
was
very
agreeably
surprised
to
see
such
a
favourable
alteration
in
his
externals
;
for
,
by
the
assistance
of
his
valet
,
he
had
purified
himself
from
the
dregs
of
his
distress
,
and
now
appeared
in
a
decent
suit
,
with
clean
linnen
,
while
his
face
was
disencumbered
of
the
hair
that
overshadowed
it
,
and
his
apartment
prepared
for
the
reception
of
company
.
    
<EOS>
They
enjoyed
their
meal
with
great
satisfaction
,
entertaining
one
another
with
a
recapitulation
of
their
former
adventures
at
the
garison
;
and
in
the
afternoon
,
Gauntlet
taking
his
leave
,
in
order
to
write
a
letter
to
his
sister
,
at
the
desire
of
his
uncle
,
who
finding
his
end
approaching
,
wanted
to
see
her
without
loss
of
time
,
Peregrine
made
his
appearance
on
the
bear
,
and
was
complimented
on
his
coming
abroad
again
,
not
only
by
his
old
mess
-
mates
,
who
had
not
seen
him
for
many
weeks
,
but
by
a
number
of
those
objects
whom
his
liberality
had
fed
,
before
his
funds
were
exhausted
.
<EOS>
Hatchway
was
,
by
his
interest
with
the
warden
,
put
in
possession
of
his
former
quarters
,
and
Pipes
dispatched
to
make
inquiry
about
Crabtree
at
his
former
lodging
,
where
he
learn'd
,
that
the
Misanthrope
,
after
a
very
severe
fit
of
illness
,
was
removed
to
Kensington
Gravel
-
pits
,
for
the
convenience
of
breathing
a
purer
air
than
that
of
London
.
    
<EOS>
In
consequence
of
this
information
,
Peregrine
,
who
knew
the
narrowness
of
the
old
gentleman
's
fortune
,
next
day
desired
his
friend
Gauntlet
to
take
the
trouble
of
visiting
him
,
in
his
name
,
with
a
letter
,
in
which
he
expressed
great
concern
for
his
indisposition
,
gave
him
notice
of
the
fortunate
intelligence
he
had
received
from
the
Downs
,
and
conjured
him
to
make
use
of
his
purse
,
if
he
was
in
the
least
hampered
in
his
circumstances
.
<EOS>
The
captain
took
coach
immediately
,
and
set
out
for
the
place
,
according
to
the
direction
which
Pipes
had
procured
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
having
seen
him
at
Bath
,
knew
him
again
at
first
sight
;
and
,
though
reduced
to
a
skeleton
,
believed
himself
in
such
a
fair
way
of
doing
well
,
that
he
would
have
accompanied
him
to
the
Fleet
immediately
,
had
not
he
been
restrained
by
his
nurse
,
who
had
been
,
by
his
physician
,
invested
with
full
authority
to
dispute
and
oppose
his
will
,
in
every
thing
that
she
should
think
prejudicial
to
his
health
;
for
he
was
considered
,
by
those
who
had
the
care
of
him
,
as
an
old
humourist
,
not
a
little
distempered
in
his
brain
.
<EOS>
He
inquired
particularly
about
the
sailors
,
who
(
he
said
)
had
deterred
him
from
carrying
on
his
usual
correspondence
with
Pickle
,
and
been
the
immediate
cause
of
his
indisposition
,
by
terrifying
him
into
a
fever
:
and
understanding
that
the
breach
between
Pickle
and
Hatchway
was
happily
cemented
,
and
that
he
was
no
longer
in
any
danger
from
the
lieutenant
's
resentment
,
he
promised
to
be
at
the
Fleet
with
the
first
convenient
opportunity
;
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
wrote
an
answer
to
Peregrine
's
letter
,
importing
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
him
for
his
offer
,
but
had
not
the
least
occasion
for
his
assistance
.
    
<EOS>
In
a
few
days
,
our
adventurer
recovered
his
vigour
,
complexion
and
vivacity
;
he
mingled
again
in
the
diversions
and
parties
of
the
place
;
he
received
,
in
a
little
time
,
the
money
he
had
lent
upon
bottomry
,
which
,
together
with
the
interest
,
amounted
to
upwards
of
eleven
hundred
pounds
.
<EOS>
The
possession
of
this
sum
,
while
it
buoyed
up
his
spirits
,
involved
him
in
perplexity
.
<EOS>
Sometimes
he
thought
it
was
incumbent
upon
him
,
as
a
man
of
honour
,
to
employ
the
greatest
part
of
it
,
in
diminishing
the
debt
for
which
he
suffered
;
on
the
other
hand
,
he
considered
that
obligation
effaced
,
by
the
treacherous
behaviour
of
his
creditor
,
who
had
injured
him
to
ten
times
the
value
of
the
sum
;
and
in
these
sentiments
,
entertained
thoughts
of
attempting
his
escape
from
prison
,
with
a
view
of
conveying
himself
,
with
the
shipwreck
of
his
fortune
,
to
another
country
,
in
which
he
might
use
it
to
better
advantage
.
    
<EOS>
Both
suggestions
were
attended
with
such
doubts
and
difficulties
,
that
he
hesitated
between
them
,
and
for
the
present
,
laid
out
a
thousand
pounds
in
stock
,
the
interest
of
which
,
together
with
the
fruits
of
his
own
industry
<EOS>
,
he
hoped
,
would
support
him
above
want
in
his
confinement
,
until
something
should
occur
,
that
would
point
out
the
expediency
of
some
other
determination
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
still
insisted
upon
having
the
honour
of
obtaining
his
liberty
,
at
the
expence
of
taking
up
his
notes
to
Gleanum
,
and
exhorted
him
to
purchase
a
commission
with
part
of
the
money
which
he
had
retrieved
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
affirmed
,
that
it
was
his
privilege
to
procure
the
release
of
his
cousin
Pickle
,
because
he
enjoyed
a
very
handsome
sum
by
his
aunt
,
which
of
right
belonged
to
the
young
gentleman
,
to
whom
he
was
,
moreover
,
indebted
for
the
use
of
his
furniture
,
and
for
the
very
house
that
stood
over
his
head
;
and
that
,
although
he
had
already
made
a
will
in
his
favour
,
he
should
never
be
satisfied
,
nor
easy
in
his
mind
,
so
long
as
he
remained
deprived
of
his
liberty
,
and
wanted
any
of
the
conveniences
of
life
.
    
<EOS>
Cadwallader
,
who
by
this
time
assisted
at
their
councils
,
and
was
best
acquainted
with
the
peculiarity
and
unbending
disposition
of
the
youth
,
proposed
,
that
seeing
he
was
so
averse
to
obligations
,
Mr
Hatchway
should
purchase
of
him
the
garison
with
its
appendages
,
which
,
at
a
moderate
price
,
would
sell
for
more
money
than
would
be
sufficient
to
discharge
his
debts
;
and
that
,
if
the
servile
subordination
of
the
army
did
not
suit
his
inclinations
,
he
might
,
with
his
reversion
,
buy
a
comfortable
annuity
,
and
retire
with
him
to
the
country
,
where
he
might
live
absolutely
independent
,
and
entertain
himself
,
as
usual
,
with
the
ridiculous
characters
of
mankind
.
    
<EOS>
This
plan
was
,
to
Pickle
,
less
disagreeable
than
any
other
project
which
had
as
yet
been
suggested
;
and
the
lieutenant
declared
himself
ready
to
execute
his
part
of
it
,
without
delay
:
but
the
soldier
was
mortified
at
the
thoughts
of
seeing
his
assistance
unnecessary
,
and
eagerly
objected
to
the
retirement
,
as
a
scheme
that
would
blast
the
fairest
promises
of
fame
and
fortune
,
and
bury
his
youth
and
talents
in
solitude
and
obscurity
.
    
<EOS>
This
earnest
opposition
on
the
part
of
Gauntlet
,
hindered
our
adventurer
from
forming
any
immediate
resolution
;
which
was
also
retarded
by
his
unwillingness
to
part
with
the
garrison
upon
any
terms
,
because
he
looked
upon
it
as
a
part
of
his
inheritance
,
which
he
could
not
dispose
of
,
without
committing
an
insult
upon
the
memory
of
the
deceased
commodore
.
    
<EOS>
Chapter
CXI
<EOS>
He
is
engaged
in
a
very
extraordinary
correspondence
,
which
is
interrupted
by
a
very
unexpected
event
.
   
<EOS>
While
this
affair
was
in
agitation
,
the
captain
told
him
,
in
the
course
of
conversation
,
that
Emilia
was
arrived
in
town
,
and
had
enquired
about
Mr
Pickle
with
such
an
eagerness
of
concern
,
as
seemed
to
proclaim
that
she
was
in
some
measure
informed
of
his
misfortune
:
he
,
therefore
,
desired
to
know
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
make
her
acquainted
with
his
situation
,
provided
he
should
be
again
importuned
by
her
on
that
subject
,
which
he
had
at
first
industriously
waved
.
    
<EOS>
This
proof
,
or
rather
presumption
of
her
sympathising
regard
,
did
not
fail
to
operate
powerfully
upon
the
bosom
of
Peregrine
,
which
was
immediately
filled
with
those
tumults
which
love
,
ill
stifled
,
frequently
excites
.
<EOS>
He
observed
,
that
his
disgrace
was
such
as
could
not
be
effectually
concealed
;
therefore
he
saw
no
reason
for
depriving
himself
of
Emilia
's
compassion
,
since
he
was
for
ever
excluded
from
her
affection
;
and
desired
Godfrey
to
present
to
his
sister
the
lowly
respects
of
a
despairing
lover
.
    
<EOS>
But
,
notwithstanding
his
declaration
of
despondence
on
this
head
,
his
imagination
involuntarily
teemed
with
more
agreeable
ideas
:
the
proposal
of
Crabtree
had
taken
root
in
his
reflection
,
and
he
could
not
help
forming
plans
of
pastoral
felicity
,
in
the
arms
of
the
lovely
Emilia
,
remote
from
those
pompous
scenes
,
which
he
now
detested
and
despised
.
<EOS>
He
amused
his
fancy
with
the
prospect
of
being
able
to
support
her
in
a
state
of
independency
,
by
means
of
the
slender
annuity
which
it
was
in
his
power
to
purchase
,
together
with
the
fruits
of
those
endeavours
,
which
would
profitably
employ
his
vacant
hours
;
and
foresaw
provision
for
his
growing
family
in
the
friendship
of
the
lieutenant
,
who
had
already
constituted
him
his
heir
.
<EOS>
He
even
parcelled
out
his
hours
,
among
the
necessary
cares
of
the
world
,
the
pleasures
of
domestic
bliss
,
and
the
enjoyments
of
a
country
life
;
and
spent
the
night
in
ideal
parties
with
his
charming
bride
,
sometimes
walking
by
the
sedgy
bank
of
some
transparent
stream
,
sometimes
pruning
the
luxuriant
vine
,
and
sometimes
sitting
in
social
converse
with
her
,
in
a
shady
grove
of
his
own
planting
.
    
<EOS>
These
,
however
,
were
no
more
than
the
shadowy
phantoms
of
imagination
,
which
,
he
well
knew
,
would
never
be
realized
:
not
that
he
believed
such
happiness
unattainable
by
a
person
in
his
circumstances
;
but
because
he
would
not
stoop
to
propose
a
scheme
,
which
might
,
in
any
shape
,
seem
to
interfere
with
the
interest
of
Emilia
,
or
subject
himself
to
a
repulse
from
that
young
lady
,
who
had
rejected
his
addresses
in
the
zenith
of
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
diverted
himself
with
these
agreeable
reveries
,
an
unexpected
event
intervened
,
in
which
she
and
her
brother
were
deeply
interested
.
    
<EOS>
The
uncle
was
tapped
for
the
dropsy
,
and
died
in
a
few
days
after
the
operation
;
having
bequeathed
,
in
his
will
,
five
thousand
pounds
to
his
nephew
,
and
twice
that
sum
to
his
niece
,
who
had
always
enjoyed
the
greatest
share
of
his
favour
.
    
<EOS>
If
our
adventurer
,
before
this
occurrence
,
looked
upon
his
love
for
Emilia
as
a
passion
which
it
was
necessary
,
at
any
rate
,
to
conquer
or
suppress
;
he
now
considered
her
accession
of
fortune
as
a
circumstance
which
confirmed
that
necessity
,
and
resolved
to
discourage
every
thought
on
that
subject
,
which
should
tend
to
the
propagation
of
hope
:
when
one
day
,
in
the
midst
of
a
conversation
calculated
for
the
purpose
,
Godfrey
put
into
his
hand
a
letter
directed
to
Mr
Pickle
,
in
the
hand
-
writing
of
Emilia
;
which
the
youth
no
sooner
recognized
,
than
his
cheeks
were
convered
with
a
crimson
dye
,
and
he
began
to
tremble
with
violent
agitation
:
for
he
,
at
once
,
guessed
the
import
of
the
billet
,
which
he
kissed
with
great
reverence
and
devotion
,
and
was
not
at
all
surprised
when
he
read
the
following
words
.
    
<EOS>
SIR
,
I
have
performed
a
sufficient
sacrifice
to
my
reputation
,
in
retaining
hitherto
the
appearance
of
that
resentment
,
which
I
had
long
ago
dismissed
;
and
as
the
late
favourable
change
in
my
situation
,
impowers
me
to
avow
my
genuine
sentiments
,
without
fear
of
censure
,
or
suspicion
of
mercenary
design
,
I
take
this
opportunity
to
assure
you
,
that
if
I
still
maintain
that
place
in
your
heart
,
which
I
was
vain
enough
to
think
I
once
possessed
,
I
am
willing
to
make
the
first
advances
to
an
accommodation
;
and
have
actually
furnished
my
brother
with
full
powers
to
conclude
it
,
in
the
name
of
your
appeased
 
Emilia
.
    
<EOS>
Pickle
,
having
kissed
the
subscription
with
great
ardour
,
fell
upon
his
knees
,
and
lifting
up
his
eyes
,
"
Thank
heaven
!
<EOS>
(
cried
he
,
with
an
air
of
transport
)
<EOS>
I
have
not
been
mistaken
in
my
opinion
of
that
generous
maid
.
<EOS>
I
believed
her
inspired
with
the
most
dignified
and
heroic
sentiments
,
and
now
she
gives
me
a
convincing
proof
of
her
magnanimity
:
it
is
now
my
business
to
approve
myself
worthy
of
her
regard
.
<EOS>
May
heaven
inflict
upon
me
the
keenest
arrows
of
its
vengeance
,
if
I
do
not
,
at
this
instant
,
contemplate
the
character
of
Emilia
with
the
most
perfect
love
and
adoration
;
yet
,
amiable
and
inchanting
as
she
is
,
I
am
,
more
than
ever
,
determined
to
sacrifice
the
interest
of
my
passion
to
my
glory
,
tho
'
<EOS>
my
life
should
fail
in
the
contest
;
and
even
to
refuse
an
offer
,
which
,
otherwise
,
the
whole
universe
should
not
bribe
me
to
forego
.
"
    
<EOS>
This
declaration
was
not
so
unexpected
as
unwelcome
to
his
friend
Gauntlet
,
who
represented
that
his
glory
was
not
at
all
interested
in
the
affair
;
because
he
had
already
vindicated
his
generosity
,
in
repeated
proffers
to
lay
his
whole
fortune
at
Emilia
's
feet
,
when
it
was
impossible
that
any
thing
selfish
could
enter
into
the
proposal
:
but
that
,
in
rejecting
her
present
purpose
,
he
would
give
the
world
an
opportunity
to
say
that
his
pride
was
capricious
,
his
obstinacy
invincible
,
and
his
sister
undeniable
reason
to
believe
,
that
either
his
passion
for
her
was
dissembled
,
or
the
ardour
of
it
considerably
abated
.
    
<EOS>
In
answer
to
these
remonstrances
,
Pickle
observed
,
that
he
had
long
set
the
world
at
defiance
;
and
as
to
the
opinion
of
Emilia
,
he
did
not
doubt
that
she
would
applaud
,
in
her
heart
,
the
resolution
he
had
taken
,
and
do
justice
to
the
purity
of
his
intention
.
    
<EOS>
It
was
not
an
easy
task
to
divert
our
hero
from
his
designs
,
at
any
time
of
life
;
but
,
since
his
confinement
,
his
inflexibility
was
become
almost
insurmountable
.
<EOS>
The
captain
,
therefore
,
after
having
discharged
his
conscience
,
in
assuring
him
that
his
sister
's
happiness
was
at
stake
,
that
his
mother
had
approved
of
the
step
she
had
taken
,
and
that
he
himself
should
be
extremely
mortified
at
his
refusal
,
forbore
to
press
him
with
further
argument
,
which
served
only
to
rivet
him
the
more
strongly
in
his
own
opinion
;
and
undertook
to
deliver
this
answer
to
Emilia
's
letter
.
    
<EOS>
Madam
,
That
I
revere
the
dignity
of
your
virtue
with
the
utmost
veneration
,
and
love
you
infinitely
more
than
life
,
I
am
at
all
times
ready
to
demonstrate
:
but
the
sacrifice
to
honour
,
it
is
now
my
turn
to
pay
,
and
such
is
the
rigour
of
my
destiny
,
that
,
in
order
to
justify
your
generosity
,
I
must
refuse
to
profit
by
your
condescension
.
<EOS>
Madam
,
I
am
doomed
to
be
for
ever
wretched
;
and
to
sigh
,
without
ceasing
,
for
the
possession
of
that
jewel
,
which
,
tho
'
now
in
my
offer
,
I
dare
not
enjoy
.
<EOS>
I
shall
not
pretend
to
express
the
anguish
that
tears
my
heart
,
whilst
I
communicate
this
fatal
renunciation
;
but
appeal
to
the
delicacy
of
your
own
sentiments
,
which
can
judge
of
my
sufferings
,
and
will
,
doubtless
,
do
justice
to
the
self
-
denial
of
your
forlorn
 
P
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
Emilia
,
who
knew
the
nicety
of
our
hero
's
pride
,
had
foreseen
the
purport
of
this
epistle
,
before
it
came
to
her
hands
:
she
did
not
,
therefore
,
despair
of
success
,
nor
desist
from
the
prosecution
of
her
plan
;
which
was
no
other
than
that
of
securing
her
own
happiness
,
in
espousing
the
man
upon
whom
she
had
fixed
her
unalterable
affection
.
<EOS>
Confident
of
his
honour
,
and
fully
satisfied
of
the
mutual
passion
with
which
they
were
inspired
,
she
gradually
decoyed
him
into
a
literary
correspondence
,
wherein
she
attempted
to
refute
the
arguments
on
which
he
grounded
his
refusal
;
and
,
without
doubt
,
the
young
gentleman
was
not
a
little
pleased
with
the
enjoyment
of
such
delightful
commerce
,
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
(
more
than
ever
)
an
opportunity
of
admiring
the
poignancy
of
her
wit
,
and
the
elegance
of
her
understanding
.
    
<EOS>
The
contemplation
of
such
excellency
,
while
it
strengthened
the
chains
with
which
she
held
him
enslaved
,
added
emulation
to
the
other
motives
that
induced
him
to
maintain
the
dispute
;
and
much
subtlety
of
reasoning
was
expended
upon
both
sides
of
this
very
particular
question
,
without
any
prospect
of
conviction
on
either
part
:
'
till
,
at
last
,
she
began
to
despair
of
making
him
a
proselyte
to
her
opinion
by
dint
of
argument
;
and
resolved
,
for
the
future
,
to
apply
herself
chiefly
to
the
irresistible
prepossessions
of
his
love
,
which
were
not
at
all
diminished
or
impaired
by
the
essays
of
her
pen
.
    
<EOS>
With
this
view
she
proposed
a
conference
,
pretending
that
it
was
impossible
to
convey
all
her
reflections
,
upon
this
subject
,
in
a
series
of
short
letters
;
and
Godfrey
undertook
to
bail
him
for
the
day
:
but
,
conscious
of
her
power
,
he
would
not
trust
himself
in
her
presence
,
tho
'
<EOS>
his
heart
throbbed
with
all
the
eagerness
of
desire
to
see
her
fair
eyes
disrobed
of
that
resentment
which
they
had
wore
so
long
,
and
to
enjoy
the
ravishing
sweets
of
a
fond
reconciliation
.
    
<EOS>
Nature
could
not
have
held
out
against
such
powerful
attacks
,
had
not
the
pride
and
caprice
of
his
disposition
been
gratified
to
the
full
in
the
triumph
of
his
resistance
:
he
looked
upon
the
contest
as
altogether
original
,
and
persevered
with
obstinacy
,
because
he
thought
himself
sure
of
favourable
terms
,
whenever
he
should
be
disposed
to
capitulate
.
<EOS>
Perhaps
he
might
have
overshot
himself
,
in
the
course
of
his
perseverance
:
a
young
lady
of
Emilia
's
fortune
and
attractions
,
could
not
fail
to
find
herself
surrounded
by
temptations
,
which
few
women
can
resist
.
<EOS>
She
might
have
misinterpreted
the
meaning
of
some
paragraph
,
or
taken
umbrage
at
an
unguarded
expression
in
one
of
Peregrine
's
letters
:
she
might
have
been
tired
out
by
his
obstinate
peculiarity
,
or
,
at
the
long
run
,
construed
it
into
madness
,
flight
,
or
indifference
;
or
,
rather
than
waste
her
prime
in
fruitless
endeavours
to
subdue
the
pride
of
an
headstrong
humorist
,
listen
to
the
voice
of
some
admirer
,
fraught
with
qualifications
sufficient
to
engage
her
esteem
and
affection
.
<EOS>
But
all
these
possibilities
were
providentially
prevented
by
an
accident
,
attended
with
more
important
consequences
than
any
we
have
hitherto
recounted
.
    
<EOS>
Early
one
morning
,
Pipes
was
disturbed
by
the
arrival
of
a
messenger
,
who
had
been
sent
express
from
the
country
by
Mr
Clover
,
with
a
packet
for
the
lieutenant
,
and
arrived
in
town
overnight
;
but
as
he
was
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
the
information
of
Jack
's
correspondent
in
the
city
,
touching
the
place
of
his
abode
,
before
he
demanded
entrance
at
the
Fleet
,
the
gate
was
shut
;
nor
would
the
turnkeys
admit
him
,
altho
'
<EOS>
he
told
them
,
that
he
was
charged
with
a
message
of
the
utmost
consequence
;
so
that
he
was
fain
to
tarry
'
till
day
-
break
,
when
he
,
at
his
earnest
solicitation
,
was
allowed
to
enter
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
opening
the
packet
,
found
a
letter
inclosed
for
Peregrine
,
with
an
earnest
request
,
that
he
would
forward
it
to
the
hands
of
that
young
gentleman
with
all
possible
dispatch
.
<EOS>
Jack
,
who
could
not
dive
into
the
meaning
of
this
extraordinary
injunction
,
began
to
imagine
that
Mrs
Clover
lay
at
the
point
of
death
,
and
wanted
to
take
her
last
farewel
of
her
brother
;
and
this
conceit
worked
so
strongly
upon
his
imagination
,
that
,
while
he
huddled
on
his
cloaths
,
and
made
the
best
of
his
way
to
the
apartment
of
our
hero
,
he
could
not
help
cursing
,
within
himself
,
the
folly
of
the
husband
in
sending
such
disagreeable
messages
to
a
man
of
Peregrine
's
impatient
temper
,
already
soured
by
his
own
uneasy
situation
.
    
<EOS>
This
reflection
would
have
induced
him
to
suppress
the
letter
,
had
not
he
been
afraid
to
tamper
with
the
ticklish
disposition
of
his
friend
,
to
whom
,
while
he
delivered
it
,
"
<EOS>
As
for
my
own
part
,
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
mayhap
<EOS>
I
may
have
as
much
natural
affection
as
another
;
<EOS>
but
,
when
my
spouse
parted
,
I
bore
my
misfortune
like
a
British
man
and
a
Christian
:
for
,
<EOS>
why
?
<EOS>
he
's
no
better
than
a
fresh
-
water
sailor
,
who
knows
not
how
to
stem
the
current
of
mischance
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
being
waked
from
a
pleasant
dream
,
in
which
the
fair
Emilia
was
principally
concerned
,
and
,
hearing
this
strange
preamble
,
sat
up
in
his
bed
,
and
unsealed
the
letter
,
in
a
state
of
mortification
and
disgust
:
<EOS>
but
what
were
the
emotions
of
his
soul
,
when
he
read
the
following
intimation
!
    
<EOS>
Dear
brother
,
It
hath
pleased
God
to
take
your
father
suddenly
off
,
by
a
fit
of
the
apoplexy
;
and
as
he
has
died
intestate
,
I
give
you
this
notice
,
that
you
may
,
with
all
speed
,
come
down
and
take
possession
of
your
right
,
in
despite
of
master
Gam
and
his
mother
,
who
,
you
may
be
sure
,
do
not
sit
easy
under
this
unexpected
dispensation
of
providence
.
<EOS>
I
have
,
by
virtue
of
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
,
taken
such
precautions
as
I
thought
necessary
for
your
advantage
;
and
the
funeral
shall
be
deferred
until
your
pleasure
be
known
.
<EOS>
Your
sister
,
tho
'
sincerely
afflicted
with
her
father
's
fate
,
submits
to
the
will
of
heaven
with
laudable
resignation
,
and
begs
you
will
set
out
for
this
place
without
delay
;
in
which
request
she
is
joined
by
,
Sir
,
 
Your
affectionate
brother
,
and
Humble
servant
,
Charles
Clover
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
at
first
,
looked
upon
this
epistle
as
a
meer
illusion
of
the
brain
,
and
a
continuation
of
the
reverie
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
.
    
<EOS>
He
read
it
ten
times
over
,
without
being
persuaded
that
he
was
actually
awake
:
he
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
shook
his
head
,
in
order
to
shake
off
the
drowsy
vapours
that
surrounded
him
:
he
hemm'd
thrice
with
great
vociferation
,
snapp'd
<EOS>
his
fingers
,
tweak'd
<EOS>
his
nose
,
started
up
from
his
bed
,
and
,
opening
the
casement
,
took
a
survey
of
the
well
-
known
objects
that
appeared
on
each
side
of
his
habitation
.
<EOS>
Every
thing
seemed
congr'ous
and
connected
,
and
he
said
,
within
himself
,
"
Sure
this
is
the
most
distinct
dream
that
ever
sleep
produced
.
<EOS>
Then
he
had
recourse
again
to
the
paper
,
which
he
carefully
perused
,
without
finding
any
variation
from
his
first
notion
of
the
contents
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
seeing
all
this
extravagance
of
action
,
accompanied
with
a
wild
stare
of
distraction
,
began
to
believe
that
his
head
was
at
length
fairly
turned
,
and
was
really
meditating
means
for
securing
his
person
;
when
Pickle
,
in
a
tone
of
surprize
,
exclaimed
,
"
Good
God
!
<EOS>
am
I
,
or
am
I
not
awake
?
"
<EOS>
"
Why
,
look
ye
,
cousin
Pickle
,
(
replied
the
lieutenant
)
<EOS>
that
is
a
question
which
the
deep
sea
-
line
of
my
understanding
is
not
long
enough
to
sound
:
but
,
howsomever
,
tho'f
<EOS>
I
ca
n't
trust
to
the
observation
I
have
taken
,
it
shall
go
hard
<EOS>
but
I
will
fall
upon
a
way
to
guess
whereabouts
we
are
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
lifted
up
a
pitcher
full
of
cold
water
,
that
stood
behind
the
outward
door
,
and
discharged
it
in
the
face
of
Peregrine
,
without
ceremony
or
hesitation
.
    
<EOS>
This
remedy
produced
the
desired
effect
:
unpalatable
as
it
was
,
the
young
gentleman
no
sooner
recovered
his
breath
,
which
was
endangered
by
such
a
sudden
application
,
than
he
<EOS>
thank'd
<EOS>
his
friend
Jack
for
the
seasonable
operation
he
had
performed
;
and
having
no
longer
any
just
reason
to
doubt
the
reality
of
what
appealed
so
convincingly
to
his
senses
,
he
shifted
himself
on
the
instant
,
not
without
hurry
and
trepidation
;
and
putting
on
his
morning
-
dress
,
sallied
forth
to
the
bear
,
in
order
to
deliberate
with
himself
on
the
important
intelligence
he
had
received
.
    
<EOS>
Hatchway
,
not
yet
fully
convinced
of
his
sanity
,
and
curious
to
know
the
purport
of
the
letter
,
which
had
affected
him
in
such
an
extraordinary
manner
,
carefully
attended
his
footsteps
in
this
excursion
,
in
hope
of
being
favoured
with
his
confidence
,
in
the
course
of
their
perambulation
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
no
sooner
appeared
at
the
street
-
door
,
than
he
was
saluted
by
the
messenger
,
who
having
posted
himself
in
the
way
for
that
purpose
,
"
God
bless
your
noble
honour
,
squire
Pickle
,
(
cried
he
)
and
give
you
joy
of
succeeding
to
your
father
's
estate
.
<EOS>
"
These
words
had
scarce
proceeded
from
his
mouth
,
when
the
lieutenant
hopping
eagerly
towards
the
countryman
,
squeezed
his
hand
with
great
affection
,
and
asked
if
the
old
gentleman
had
actually
taken
his
departure
:
"
Ay
,
master
Hatchway
,
(
replied
the
other
)
in
such
a
woundy
haste
,
that
he
forgot
to
make
a
will
.
"
<EOS>
"
Body
of
me
!
<EOS>
(
exclaimed
the
seaman
)
<EOS>
these
are
the
best
tidings
I
have
heard
since
I
first
went
to
sea
.
<EOS>
Here
,
my
lad
,
take
my
purse
,
and
stow
thyself
chocque
-
full
of
the
best
liquor
in
the
land
.
"
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
tipped
the
peasant
with
ten
pieces
,
and
immediately
the
whole
place
ecchoed
with
the
sound
of
Tom
's
instrument
;
while
Peregrine
,
repairing
to
the
walk
,
communicated
the
billet
to
his
honest
friend
,
who
,
at
his
desire
,
went
forthwith
to
the
lodgings
of
captain
Gauntlet
,
and
returned
in
less
than
half
an
hour
with
that
gentleman
,
who
(
I
need
not
say
)
was
heartily
rejoiced
at
the
occasion
.

Chapter
CXII
   
<EOS>
Nor
did
our
hero
keep
the
misanthrope
in
ignorance
of
this
happy
turn
of
fortune
:
Pipes
was
dispatched
to
the
senior
,
with
a
message
requesting
his
immediate
presence
;
and
he
accordingly
appeared
,
in
obedience
to
the
summons
,
growling
with
discontent
,
for
having
been
deprived
of
several
hours
of
his
natural
rest
.
<EOS>
His
mouth
was
immediately
stopped
with
the
letter
,
at
which
he
smiled
horrible
a
ghastly
grin
;
and
,
after
a
compliment
of
congratulation
,
they
entered
into
close
divan
,
about
the
measures
to
be
taken
in
consequence
of
this
event
.
    
<EOS>
There
was
no
room
for
much
debate
:
it
was
unanimously
agreed
,
that
Pickle
should
set
out
,
with
all
possible
dispatch
,
for
the
garison
,
to
which
Gauntlet
and
Hatchway
resolved
to
attend
him
;
and
Pipes
was
accordingly
ordered
to
prepare
a
couple
of
post
-
chaises
,
while
Godfrey
went
to
procure
bail
for
his
friend
,
and
provide
them
with
money
for
the
expence
of
the
expedition
,
but
not
before
he
was
desired
by
Peregrine
to
conceal
this
piece
of
news
from
his
sister
,
that
our
youth
might
have
an
opportunity
to
surprise
her
in
a
more
interesting
manner
,
after
he
should
have
settled
his
affairs
.
    
<EOS>
All
these
previous
steps
being
taken
in
less
than
an
hour
,
our
hero
took
his
leave
of
the
Fleet
,
after
he
had
left
twenty
guineas
with
the
warden
for
the
relief
of
the
poor
prisoners
,
a
great
number
of
whom
conveyed
him
to
the
gate
,
pouring
forth
prayers
for
his
long
life
and
prosperity
;
and
he
took
the
road
to
the
garison
,
in
the
most
elevated
transports
of
joy
,
unallayed
with
the
least
mixture
of
grief
at
the
death
of
a
parent
whose
paternal
tenderness
he
had
never
known
;
so
that
his
breast
was
absolutely
a
stranger
to
<EOS>
that
boasted
 
Storgh
,
or
instinct
of
affection
,
by
which
the
charities
are
supposed
to
subsist
.
    
<EOS>
Of
all
the
journeys
he
had
ever
made
,
this
,
sure
,
was
the
most
delightful
:
he
felt
all
the
extasy
that
must
naturally
be
produced
in
a
young
man
of
his
imagination
,
from
such
a
sudden
transition
,
in
point
of
circumstance
;
he
found
himself
delivered
from
confinement
and
disgrace
,
without
being
obliged
to
any
person
upon
earth
for
his
deliverance
;
he
had
it
now
in
his
power
to
retort
the
contempt
of
the
world
,
in
a
manner
suited
to
his
most
sanguine
wish
;
he
was
reconciled
to
his
friend
,
and
enabled
to
gratify
his
love
,
even
upon
his
own
terms
;
and
saw
himself
in
possession
of
a
fortune
more
ample
than
his
first
inheritance
,
with
a
stock
of
experience
that
would
steer
him
clear
of
all
those
quicksands
among
which
he
had
been
formerly
wrecked
.
    
<EOS>
In
the
middle
of
their
journey
,
while
they
halted
at
an
inn
for
a
short
refreshment
and
change
of
horses
,
a
postilion
ran
up
to
Peregrine
in
the
yard
,
and
falling
at
his
feet
,
clasped
his
knees
with
great
eagerness
and
agitation
,
and
presented
to
him
the
individual
face
of
his
old
valet
de
chambre
.
<EOS>
The
youth
perceiving
him
in
such
an
abject
garb
and
attitude
,
commanded
him
to
rise
,
and
tell
the
cause
of
such
a
miserable
reverse
in
his
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Upon
which
Hadgi
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
he
had
been
ruined
by
his
wife
,
who
having
robbed
him
of
all
his
cash
and
valuable
effects
,
had
eloped
from
his
house
,
with
one
of
his
own
customers
,
who
appeared
in
the
character
of
a
French
count
,
but
was
in
reality
no
other
than
an
Italian
fidler
;
that
,
in
consequence
of
this
retreat
,
he
(
the
husband
)
was
disabled
from
paying
a
considerable
sum
which
he
had
set
apart
for
his
wine
-
merchant
,
who
being
disappointed
in
his
expectation
,
took
out
an
extent
against
his
effects
;
and
the
rest
of
his
creditors
following
his
example
,
hunted
him
out
of
house
and
home
:
so
that
,
finding
his
person
in
danger
at
London
,
he
had
been
obliged
to
escape
into
the
country
,
skulking
about
from
one
village
to
another
,
till
being
quite
destitute
of
all
support
,
he
had
undertaken
his
present
office
,
to
save
himself
from
starving
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
listened
with
compassion
to
his
lamentable
tale
,
which
too
well
accounted
for
his
not
appearing
in
the
Fleet
,
with
offers
of
service
to
his
master
in
distress
,
a
circumstance
that
Pickle
had
all
along
imputed
to
his
avarice
and
ingratitude
;
and
he
assured
him
,
that
as
he
had
been
the
means
of
throwing
in
his
way
the
temptation
to
which
he
fell
a
sacrifice
,
he
would
charge
himself
with
the
retrieval
of
his
affairs
:
in
the
mean
time
,
he
made
him
taste
of
his
bounty
,
and
desired
him
to
continue
in
his
present
employment
,
until
he
should
return
from
the
garison
,
when
he
would
consider
his
situation
,
and
do
something
for
his
immediate
relief
.
    
<EOS>
Hadgi
attempted
to
kiss
his
shoe
,
and
wept
,
or
affected
to
weep
,
with
sensibility
,
at
this
gracious
reception
;
he
even
made
a
merit
of
his
unwillingness
to
exercise
his
new
occupation
,
and
earnestly
begged
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
give
immediate
attendance
upon
his
dear
master
,
from
whom
he
could
not
bear
the
thoughts
of
a
second
parting
.
<EOS>
His
intreaties
were
reinforced
by
the
intercession
of
his
two
friends
,
in
consequence
of
which
the
Swiss
was
permitted
to
follow
them
at
his
own
leisure
,
while
they
set
forwards
,
after
a
slight
repast
,
and
reached
the
place
of
their
destination
before
ten
o
'
clock
at
night
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
instead
of
alighting
at
the
garison
,
rode
straightway
to
his
father
's
house
;
and
no
person
appearing
to
receive
him
,
not
even
a
servant
to
take
care
of
his
chaise
,
he
dismounted
without
assistance
,
and
being
followed
by
his
two
friends
,
advanced
into
the
hall
,
where
perceiving
a
bell
-
rope
,
he
made
immediate
application
to
it
,
in
such
a
manner
as
brought
a
couple
of
footmen
into
his
presence
.
<EOS>
After
having
reprimanded
them
,
with
a
stern
look
,
for
their
neglect
,
in
point
of
attendance
,
he
commanded
them
to
shew
him
into
an
apartment
;
and
,
as
they
seemed
unwilling
to
yield
obedience
to
his
orders
,
asked
if
they
did
not
belong
to
the
family
?
    
<EOS>
One
of
them
,
who
took
upon
himself
the
office
of
spokesman
,
replied
with
a
sullen
air
,
that
they
had
been
in
the
service
of
old
Mr
Pickle
,
and
now
that
he
was
dead
,
thought
themselves
bound
to
obey
no
body
but
their
lady
,
and
her
son
Mr
Gamaliel
.
    
<EOS>
This
declaration
had
scarce
proceeded
from
his
mouth
,
when
our
hero
gave
them
to
understand
,
that
since
they
were
not
disposed
to
own
any
other
master
,
they
must
change
their
quarters
immediately
;
and
ordered
them
to
decamp
without
further
preparation
:
<EOS>
and
as
they
still
continued
restiff
,
they
were
kicked
out
of
doors
by
the
captain
and
his
friend
Hatchway
.
<EOS>
Squire
Gam
,
who
overheard
every
thing
that
passed
,
and
was
now
more
than
ever
inflamed
with
that
rancour
which
he
had
sucked
with
his
mother
's
milk
,
flew
to
the
assistance
of
his
adherents
,
with
a
pistol
in
each
hand
,
bellowing
Thieves
!
<EOS>
thieves
!
<EOS>
with
great
vociferation
,
as
if
he
had
mistaken
the
business
of
the
strangers
,
and
actually
believed
himself
in
danger
of
being
robbed
.
<EOS>
Under
this
pretence
he
discharged
a
piece
at
his
brother
,
who
luckily
escaping
the
shot
,
closed
with
him
in
a
moment
,
and
wresting
the
other
pistol
from
his
gripe
,
turned
him
out
into
the
court
-
yard
,
to
the
consolation
of
his
two
dependants
.
    
<EOS>
By
this
time
,
Pipes
and
the
two
postilions
had
taken
possession
of
the
stables
,
without
being
opposed
by
the
coachman
and
his
deputy
,
who
quietly
submitted
to
the
authority
of
their
new
sovereign
;
but
the
noise
of
the
pistol
had
alarmed
Mrs
Pickle
,
who
running
down
stairs
,
with
the
most
frantic
appearance
,
attended
by
two
maids
and
the
curate
,
who
still
maintained
his
place
of
chaplain
and
ghostly
director
in
the
family
,
would
have
assaulted
our
hero
with
her
nails
,
had
not
she
been
restrained
by
her
attendants
,
who
,
tho
'
they
prevented
her
from
using
her
hands
,
could
not
hinder
her
from
exercising
her
tongue
,
which
she
wagged
against
him
with
all
the
virulence
of
malice
.
    
<EOS>
She
ask'd
,
<EOS>
if
he
was
come
to
butcher
his
brother
,
to
insult
his
father
's
corpse
,
and
triumph
in
her
affliction
;
she
bestowed
upon
him
the
epithets
of
spendthrift
,
jailbird
,
and
unnatural
ruffian
;
she
begg'd
pardon
of
God
for
having
brought
such
a
monster
into
the
world
,
accused
him
of
having
brought
his
father
's
grey
hairs
with
sorrow
to
the
grave
;
and
affirmed
,
that
were
he
to
touch
the
body
,
it
would
bleed
at
his
approach
.
    
<EOS>
Without
pretending
to
refute
the
articles
of
this
ridiculous
charge
,
he
allowed
her
to
ring
out
her
alarm
;
and
then
calmly
replied
,
that
if
she
did
not
quietly
retire
to
her
chamber
,
and
behave
as
became
a
person
in
her
present
situation
,
he
should
insist
upon
her
removing
to
another
lodging
,
without
delay
;
for
he
was
determined
to
be
master
in
his
own
family
.
<EOS>
The
lady
,
who
,
in
all
probability
,
expected
that
he
would
endeavour
to
appease
her
with
all
the
tenderness
of
filial
submission
,
was
so
much
exasperated
at
his
cavalier
behaviour
,
that
her
constitution
could
not
support
the
transports
of
her
spirits
;
and
she
was
carried
off
by
her
women
,
in
a
fit
,
while
the
officious
clergyman
was
dismiss'd
<EOS>
after
his
pupil
,
with
all
the
circumstances
of
disgrace
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
having
thus
made
his
quarters
good
,
took
possession
of
the
best
apartment
in
the
house
,
and
sent
notice
of
his
arrival
to
Mr
Clover
,
who
,
with
his
wife
,
visited
him
in
less
than
an
hour
,
and
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
find
him
so
suddenly
settled
in
his
father
's
house
.
<EOS>
The
meeting
of
Julia
and
her
brother
was
extremely
pathetic
.
    
<EOS>
She
had
always
loved
him
with
uncommon
tenderness
,
and
looked
upon
him
as
the
ornament
of
her
family
;
but
she
had
heard
of
his
extravagancies
with
regret
,
and
tho
'
<EOS>
she
considered
the
stories
that
were
circulated
at
his
expence
,
as
the
malicious
exaggerations
of
his
mother
and
her
darling
son
,
her
apprehension
had
been
grievously
alarmed
by
an
account
of
his
imprisonment
and
distress
,
which
had
been
accidentally
conveyed
to
that
country
by
a
gentleman
from
London
,
who
had
been
formerly
of
his
acquaintance
:
she
could
not
,
therefore
,
without
the
most
tender
emotions
of
joy
,
see
him
,
as
it
were
,
restored
to
his
rightful
inheritance
,
and
re
-
established
in
that
station
of
life
which
she
thought
he
could
fill
with
dignity
and
importance
.
    
<EOS>
After
their
mutual
expressions
of
affection
,
she
retired
to
her
mother
's
chamber
,
with
a
view
to
make
a
second
offer
of
her
service
and
attendance
,
which
had
been
already
rejected
with
scorn
since
her
father
's
death
;
while
Peregrine
consulted
his
brother
-
in
-
law
,
about
the
affairs
of
the
family
,
so
far
as
they
had
fallen
within
his
cognizance
and
observation
.
    
<EOS>
Mr
Clover
told
him
,
that
though
he
was
never
favoured
with
the
confidence
of
the
defunct
,
he
knew
some
of
his
intimates
,
who
had
been
tampered
with
by
Mrs
Pickle
,
and
even
engaged
to
second
the
remonstrances
by
which
she
had
often
endeavoured
to
persuade
her
husband
to
settle
his
affairs
by
a
formal
will
;
but
that
he
had
from
time
to
time
evaded
their
importunities
with
surprising
excuses
of
procrastination
,
that
plainly
appeared
to
be
the
result
of
invention
and
design
,
far
above
the
supposed
pitch
of
his
capacity
;
a
circumstance
from
which
Mr
Clover
concluded
,
that
the
old
gentleman
imagined
his
life
would
not
have
been
secure
,
had
he
once
taken
such
a
step
as
must
have
rendered
it
unnecessary
to
the
independence
of
his
second
son
.
    
<EOS>
He
moreover
observed
,
that
,
in
consequence
of
this
information
,
he
no
sooner
heard
of
Mr
Pickle
's
death
,
which
happened
at
the
club
,
than
he
went
directly
,
with
a
lawyer
,
to
his
house
,
before
any
cabal
or
conspiracy
could
be
formed
against
the
rightful
heir
;
and
,
in
presence
of
witnesses
provided
for
the
purpose
,
sealed
up
all
the
papers
of
the
deceased
,
after
the
widow
had
,
in
the
first
transports
of
her
sorrow
and
vexation
,
fairly
owned
,
that
her
husband
had
died
intestate
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
was
extremely
well
satisfied
with
this
intelligence
,
by
which
all
his
doubts
were
dispelled
,
and
having
chearfully
supped
with
his
friends
on
a
cold
collation
which
his
brother
-
in
-
law
had
brought
in
his
chariot
,
they
retired
to
rest
,
in
different
chambers
,
after
Julia
had
met
with
another
repulse
from
her
capricious
mother
,
whose
overflowing
rage
had
now
subsided
into
the
former
channel
of
calm
inveteracy
.
    
<EOS>
Next
morning
the
house
was
supplied
with
some
servants
from
the
garison
,
and
preparations
made
for
the
funeral
of
the
deceased
;
and
Gam
having
taken
lodgings
in
the
neighbourhood
,
came
with
a
chaise
and
cart
to
demand
his
mother
,
together
with
his
own
cloaths
,
and
her
personal
effects
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
,
tho
'
he
would
not
suffer
him
to
enter
the
door
,
allowed
his
proposal
to
be
communicated
to
the
widow
,
who
eagerly
embraced
the
opportunity
of
removing
,
and
was
,
with
her
own
baggage
,
and
that
of
her
beloved
son
,
conveyed
to
the
place
which
he
had
prepared
for
her
reception
;
whither
she
was
followed
by
her
woman
,
who
was
desired
by
Peregrine
to
assure
her
mistress
,
that
,
until
a
regular
provision
could
be
settled
upon
her
,
she
might
command
him
,
in
point
of
money
,
or
any
other
accommodation
in
his
power
.

Chapter
CXIII
<EOS>
He
performs
the
last
offices
to
his
father
,
and
returns
to
London
,
upon
a
very
interesting
design
.
   
<EOS>
Suits
of
mourning
being
provided
for
himself
,
his
friends
and
adherents
,
and
every
other
previous
measure
taken
,
suitable
to
the
occasion
,
his
father
was
interred
,
in
a
private
manner
,
in
the
parish
-
church
;
and
his
papers
being
examined
,
in
presence
of
many
persons
of
honour
and
integrity
,
invited
for
that
purpose
<EOS>
,
no
will
was
found
,
or
any
other
deed
,
in
favour
of
the
second
son
,
tho
'
it
appeared
by
the
marriage
settlement
,
that
the
widow
was
intitled
to
a
jointure
of
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
.
<EOS>
The
rest
of
his
papers
consisted
of
East
-
India
bonds
,
South
-
sea
annuities
,
mortgages
,
notes
and
assignments
,
to
the
amount
of
fourscore
thousand
seven
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
,
exclusive
of
the
house
,
plate
and
furniture
,
horses
,
equipage
and
cattle
,
with
the
garden
and
park
adjacent
,
to
a
very
considerable
extent
.
    
<EOS>
This
was
a
sum
that
even
exceeded
his
expectation
,
and
could
not
fail
to
entertain
his
fancy
with
the
most
agreeable
ideas
.
<EOS>
He
found
himself
immediately
a
man
of
vast
consequence
among
his
country
neighbours
,
who
visited
him
with
compliments
of
congratulation
,
and
treated
him
with
such
respect
as
would
have
effectually
spoiled
any
young
man
of
his
disposition
,
who
had
not
the
same
advantages
of
experience
as
he
had
already
purchased
at
a
very
extravagant
price
.
    
<EOS>
Thus
shielded
with
caution
,
he
bore
his
prosperity
with
surprising
temperance
;
every
body
was
charmed
with
his
affability
and
moderation
;
and
when
he
made
a
circuit
round
the
gentlemen
of
the
district
,
<EOS>
in
order
to
repay
the
courtesy
which
he
owed
,
he
was
caressed
by
them
with
uncommon
assiduity
,
and
advised
to
offer
himself
as
a
candidate
for
the
county
,
at
the
next
election
,
which
,
they
supposed
,
would
soon
happen
,
because
the
present
member
was
in
a
declining
state
of
health
.
<EOS>
Nor
did
his
person
and
address
escape
unheeded
by
the
ladies
,
many
of
whom
did
not
scruple
to
spread
their
attractions
before
him
,
with
a
view
of
captivating
such
a
valuable
prize
:
nay
,
such
an
impression
did
this
legacy
make
upon
a
certain
peer
,
who
resided
in
this
part
of
the
country
,
that
he
cultivated
Pickle
's
acquaintance
with
great
eagerness
,
and
,
without
circumlocution
,
offered
to
him
in
marriage
<EOS>
his
only
daughter
,
with
a
very
considerable
fortune
.
    
<EOS>
Our
hero
expressed
himself
,
upon
this
occasion
,
as
became
a
man
of
honour
,
sensibility
and
politeness
;
and
frankly
gave
his
lordship
to
understand
,
that
his
heart
was
already
engaged
.
<EOS>
He
was
pleased
with
the
opportunity
of
making
such
a
sacrifice
to
his
passion
for
Emilia
,
which
,
by
this
time
,
inflamed
his
thoughts
to
such
a
degree
of
impatience
,
that
he
resolved
to
depart
for
London
,
with
all
possible
speed
;
and
for
that
purpose
industriously
employed
almost
every
hour
of
his
time
in
regulating
his
domestic
affairs
.
    
<EOS>
He
paid
off
all
his
father
's
servants
,
and
hired
others
,
at
the
recommendation
of
his
sister
,
who
promised
to
superintend
his
houshold
in
his
absence
:
he
advanced
the
first
half
-
yearly
payment
of
his
mother
's
jointure
;
and
as
for
his
brother
Gam
,
he
gave
him
divers
opportunities
of
acknowledging
his
faults
,
so
as
that
he
might
have
answered
to
his
own
conscience
for
taking
any
step
in
his
favour
;
but
that
young
gentleman
was
not
yet
sufficiently
humbled
by
misfortune
,
and
not
only
forbore
to
make
any
overtures
of
peace
,
but
also
took
all
occasions
to
slander
the
conduct
and
revile
the
person
of
our
hero
,
being
,
in
this
practice
,
comforted
and
abetted
by
his
righteous
mamma
.
    
<EOS>
Every
thing
being
thus
settled
for
the
present
,
the
triumvirate
set
out
on
their
return
to
town
,
in
the
same
manner
with
that
in
which
they
had
arrived
in
the
country
,
except
in
this
small
variation
,
that
Hatchway
's
chaise
-
companion
was
now
the
valet
de
chambre
refitted
,
instead
of
Pipes
,
who
,
with
another
lacquey
,
attended
them
on
horseback
.
<EOS>
When
they
had
performed
two
thirds
of
their
way
to
London
,
they
chanced
to
overtake
a
country
squire
,
on
his
return
from
a
visit
to
one
of
his
neighbours
,
who
had
entertained
him
with
such
hospitality
,
that
(
as
the
lieutenant
observed
)
<EOS>
he
rolled
himself
almost
gun
wale
to
,
at
every
motion
of
his
horse
,
which
was
a
fine
hunter
;
and
when
the
chaises
pass'd
<EOS>
him
at
full
speed
,
he
set
up
the
sportsman
's
hollow
,
in
a
voice
that
sounded
like
a
French
horn
,
clapping
spurs
to
Sorrel
at
the
same
time
,
in
order
to
keep
up
with
the
pace
of
the
machine
.
    
<EOS>
Peregrine
,
who
was
animated
with
an
uncommon
flow
of
spirits
,
ordered
his
postilion
to
proceed
more
softly
;
and
entered
into
conversation
with
the
stranger
,
touching
the
make
and
mettle
of
his
horse
,
upon
which
he
descanted
with
so
much
learning
,
that
the
squire
was
astonished
at
his
knowledge
,
and
so
engaged
with
his
manner
of
discourse
,
that
,
when
they
approached
his
habitation
,
he
invited
the
young
gentleman
and
his
company
to
halt
,
and
drink
a
bottle
of
his
ale
;
and
was
so
pressing
in
his
solicitation
,
that
they
complied
with
his
request
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
conducted
them
through
a
spacious
avenue
,
that
extended
as
far
as
the
highway
,
to
the
gate
of
a
large
chateau
,
of
a
most
noble
and
venerable
appearance
,
which
induced
them
to
alight
and
view
the
apartments
,
contrary
to
their
first
intention
of
drinking
a
glass
of
his
October
at
the
door
.
    
<EOS>
The
rooms
were
every
way
suitable
to
the
magnificence
of
the
outside
,
and
our
hero
imagined
they
had
made
a
tour
through
the
whole
sweep
,
when
the
landlord
gave
him
to
understand
that
they
had
not
yet
seen
the
best
apartment
of
the
house
,
and
immediately
led
them
into
a
spacious
dining
-
room
,
which
Peregrine
did
not
enter
without
giving
manifest
signs
of
uncommon
astonishment
.
<EOS>
The
pannels
all
round
were
covered
with
portraits
,
at
full
length
,
by
Vandyke
;
and
not
one
of
them
appeared
without
a
ridiculous
tye
-
perriwig
,
in
the
style
of
those
that
usually
hang
over
the
shops
of
two
-
penny
barbers
.
<EOS>
The
strait
boots
in
which
the
figures
had
been
originally
painted
,
and
the
other
circumstances
of
attitude
and
drapery
,
so
inconsistent
with
this
monstrous
furniture
of
the
head
,
exhibited
such
a
ludicrous
appearance
,
that
Pickle
's
wonder
,
in
a
little
time
,
gave
way
to
his
mirth
,
and
he
was
seized
with
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
,
which
had
well
nigh
deprived
him
of
his
breath
.
    
<EOS>
The
squire
,
half
pleased
and
half
offended
at
this
expression
of
ridicule
<EOS>
,
"
I
know
(
said
he
)
<EOS>
what
makes
you
laugh
so
woefully
<EOS>
:
you
think
it
strange
to
zee
my
vorefathers
booted
and
spurred
,
with
huge
three
-
tailed
perriwigs
on
their
pates
.
<EOS>
The
truth
of
the
matter
is
this
:
I
could
not
abide
to
zee
the
pictures
of
my
vamily
,
with
a
parcel
of
loose
hair
hanging
about
their
eyes
,
like
zo
many
colts
;
and
zo
I
employed
a
painter
vellow
from
Lundon
to
clap
decent
perriwigs
upon
their
skulls
,
at
the
rate
of
vive
shillings
a
head
,
and
offered
him
three
shillings
a
-
piece
to
furnish
each
with
an
handzome
pair
of
shoes
and
stockings
:
but
the
rascal
,
thinking
I
must
have
'em
done
at
any
price
,
after
their
heads
were
covered
,
haggled
with
me
for
your
shillings
a
picture
;
and
zo
,
rather
than
be
imposed
upon
,
I
turned
him
off
,
and
shall
let
'em
stand
as
they
are
,
'
till
zome
more
reasonable
brother
of
the
brush
comes
round
the
country
.
"
    
<EOS>
Pickle
commended
his
resolution
,
tho
'
,
in
his
heart
,
he
blessed
himself
from
such
a
barbarous
Goth
;
and
,
after
they
had
dispatched
two
or
three
bottles
of
his
beer
,
they
proceeded
on
their
journey
,
and
arrived
in
town
about
eleven
at
night
.

THE
LAST
<EOS>
He
enjoys
an
interview
with
Emilia
,
and
makes
himself
ample
amends
for
all
the
mortifications
of
his
life
.
   
<EOS>
Godfrey
,
who
had
taken
leave
of
his
sister
,
on
pretence
of
making
a
short
excursion
with
Peregrine
,
whose
health
required
the
enjoyment
of
fresh
air
,
after
his
long
confinement
,
sent
a
message
to
her
,
that
same
night
,
announcing
his
arrival
,
and
giving
her
notice
that
he
would
breakfast
with
her
next
morning
;
when
he
and
our
hero
,
who
had
dressed
himself
for
the
purpose
,
taking
a
hackney
-
coach
,
repaired
to
her
lodging
,
and
were
introduced
into
a
parlour
,
adjoining
to
that
in
which
the
tea
-
table
was
set
.
<EOS>
Here
they
had
not
waited
many
minutes
when
they
heard
the
sound
of
feet
,
coming
down
stairs
;
upon
which
our
hero
's
heart
began
to
beat
the
alarm
,
and
he
concealed
himself
behind
the
screen
,
by
the
direction
of
his
friend
,
whose
ears
being
saluted
with
Sophy
's
voice
from
the
next
room
,
he
flew
into
it
with
great
ardour
,
and
enjoyed
upon
her
lips
the
sweet
transports
of
a
meeting
so
unexpected
;
for
he
had
left
her
in
her
father
's
house
at
Windsor
.
    
<EOS>
Amidst
these
emotions
,
he
had
almost
forgot
the
situation
of
Peregrine
;
when
Emilia
,
assuming
an
enchanting
air
,
"
Is
not
this
(
said
she
)
a
most
provoking
scene
to
a
young
woman
like
me
,
who
am
doomed
to
wear
the
willow
,
by
the
strange
caprice
of
my
lover
?
<EOS>
Upon
my
word
,
brother
,
you
have
done
me
infinite
prejudice
,
in
promoting
this
jaunt
with
my
obstinate
correspondent
;
who
,
I
suppose
,
is
so
ravished
with
this
transient
glimpse
of
liberty
.
<EOS>
that
he
will
never
be
persuaded
to
incur
unnecessary
confinement
for
the
future
.
"
<EOS>
"
My
dear
sister
,
(
replied
the
captain
,
tauntingly
)
<EOS>
your
own
pride
set
him
the
example
;
so
you
must
<EOS>
e'en
stand
to
the
consequence
of
his
imitation
.
"
<EOS>
"
'
Tis
a
hard
case
,
however
,
(
answered
the
fair
offender
)
that
I
should
suffer
all
my
life
,
by
one
venial
trespass
.
<EOS>
Heigh
ho
!
<EOS>
who
would
imagine
that
a
sprightly
girl
,
such
as
I
,
with
ten
thousand
pounds
,
should
go
a
begging
?
    
<EOS>
I
have
a
good
mind
to
marry
the
next
person
that
asks
me
the
question
,
in
order
to
be
revenged
upon
this
unyielding
humourist
.
<EOS>
Did
the
dear
fellow
discover
no
inclination
to
see
me
,
in
all
the
term
of
his
releasement
?
<EOS>
Well
,
if
ever
I
can
catch
the
fugitive
again
,
he
shall
sing
in
his
cage
for
life
.
"
    
<EOS>
It
is
impossible
to
convey
to
the
reader
a
just
idea
of
Peregrine
's
transports
,
while
he
overheard
this
declaration
;
which
was
no
sooner
pronounced
,
than
,
unable
to
resist
the
impetuosity
of
his
passion
,
he
sprung
from
his
lurking
place
,
exclaiming
,
"
Here
I
surrender
;
"
and
rushing
into
her
presence
,
was
so
dazzled
with
her
beauty
,
that
his
speech
failed
:
he
was
fixed
,
like
a
statue
,
to
the
floor
;
and
all
his
faculties
were
absorpt
in
admiration
.
<EOS>
Indeed
,
she
was
now
in
the
full
bloom
of
her
charms
,
and
it
was
nearly
impossible
to
look
upon
her
without
emotion
.
<EOS>
What
then
must
have
been
the
extasy
of
our
youth
,
whose
passion
was
whetted
with
all
the
incitements
which
could
stimulate
the
human
heart
!
<EOS>
The
ladies
screamed
with
surprize
at
his
appearance
,
and
Emilia
underwent
such
agitation
as
flushed
every
charm
with
irresistible
energy
:
her
cheeks
glowed
with
a
most
delicate
suffusion
,
and
her
bosom
heaved
with
such
bewitching
undulation
,
that
the
cambrick
could
not
conceal
or
contain
the
snowy
hemispheres
,
that
rose
like
a
vision
of
paradise
to
his
view
.
    
<EOS>
While
he
was
almost
fainting
with
unutterable
delight
,
she
seemed
ready
to
sink
under
the
tumults
of
tenderness
and
confusion
;
when
our
hero
,
perceiving
her
condition
,
obeyed
the
impulse
of
his
love
,
and
circled
the
charmer
in
his
arms
,
without
suffering
the
least
frown
or
symptom
of
displeasure
.
    
<EOS>
Not
all
the
pleasures
of
his
life
,
had
amounted
to
the
ineffable
joy
of
this
embrace
,
in
which
he
continued
for
some
minutes
totally
entranced
.
<EOS>
He
fastened
upon
her
pouting
lips
,
with
all
the
eagerness
of
rapture
;
and
,
while
his
brain
seemed
to
whirl
round
with
transport
,
exclaimed
in
a
delirium
of
bliss
,
"
Heaven
and
earth
!
<EOS>
this
is
too
much
to
bear
!
"
    
<EOS>
His
imagination
was
accordingly
relieved
,
and
his
attention
in
some
measure
divided
,
by
the
interposition
of
Sophy
,
who
kindly
chid
him
for
his
having
overlooked
his
old
friends
:
thus
accosted
,
he
quitted
his
delicious
armful
,
and
,
saluting
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
asked
pardon
for
his
neglect
;
observing
,
that
such
rudeness
was
excuseable
,
considering
the
long
and
unhappy
exile
which
he
had
suffered
,
from
the
jewel
of
his
soul
.
<EOS>
Then
turning
to
Emilia
,
"
I
am
come
,
madam
,
(
said
he
)
to
claim
the
performance
of
your
promise
,
which
I
can
produce
under
your
own
fair
hand
:
you
may
,
therefore
,
lay
aside
all
superfluous
ceremony
and
shyness
,
and
crown
my
happiness
without
farther
delay
;
for
,
upon
my
soul
!
<EOS>
my
thoughts
are
wound
up
to
the
last
pitch
of
expectation
,
and
I
shall
certainly
run
distracted
,
if
I
am
doomed
to
any
term
of
probation
.
"
    
<EOS>
His
mistress
,
having
by
this
time
recollected
herself
,
replied
with
a
most
exhilerating
smile
,
"
I
ought
to
punish
you
,
for
your
obstinacy
,
with
the
mortification
of
a
twelve
-
month
's
trial
;
but
'
tis
dangerous
to
tamper
with
an
admirer
of
your
disposition
,
and
therefore
,
I
think
,
I
must
make
sure
of
you
while
it
is
in
my
power
.
"
<EOS>
"
You
are
willing
,
then
,
to
take
me
for
better
for
worse
,
in
presence
of
heaven
and
these
witnesses
?
"
cried
Peregrine
,
kneeling
,
and
applying
her
hand
to
his
lips
.
    
<EOS>
At
this
interrogation
,
her
features
softened
into
an
amazing
expression
of
condescending
love
;
and
while
she
darted
a
side
-
glance
,
that
thrilled
to
his
marrow
,
and
heaved
a
sigh
more
soft
than
zephyr
's
balmy
wing
,
her
answer
was
,
"
Why
 
ay
 
and
heaven
grant
me
patience
to
bear
the
humours
of
such
a
yokefellow
.
"
<EOS>
"
And
may
the
same
powers
(
replied
the
youth
)
grant
me
life
and
opportunity
to
manifest
the
immensity
of
my
love
.
<EOS>
Mean
<EOS>
while
,
I
have
eighty
thousand
pounds
,
which
shall
be
laid
immediately
in
your
lap
.
"
    
<EOS>
So
saying
,
he
sealed
the
contract
upon
her
lips
,
and
explained
the
mystery
of
his
last
words
,
which
had
begun
to
operate
upon
the
wonder
of
the
two
sisters
.
<EOS>
Sophy
was
agreeably
surprised
with
the
account
of
his
good
fortune
:
nor
was
it
,
in
all
probability
,
unacceptable
to
the
lovely
Emilia
;
tho
'
,
from
this
information
,
she
took
an
opportunity
to
upbraid
her
admirer
with
the
inflexibility
of
his
pride
,
which
(
she
scrupled
not
to
say
)
would
have
baffled
all
the
suggestions
of
his
passion
,
had
not
it
been
gratified
by
this
providential
event
.
    
<EOS>
Matters
being
thus
happily
matured
,
the
lover
begged
that
immediate
recourse
might
be
had
to
the
church
,
and
his
happiness
ascertained
before
night
.
<EOS>
But
the
bride
objected
,
with
great
vehemence
,
to
such
precipitation
,
being
desirous
of
her
mother
's
presence
at
the
ceremony
;
and
she
was
seconded
in
her
opinion
by
her
brother
's
wife
:
upon
which
Peregrine
,
maddening
with
desire
,
assaulted
her
with
the
most
earnest
intreaties
,
representing
,
that
,
as
her
mother
's
consent
was
already
obtained
,
there
was
surely
no
necessity
for
a
delay
,
that
must
infallibly
make
a
dangerous
impression
upon
his
brain
and
constitution
.
    
<EOS>
He
fell
at
her
feet
,
in
all
the
agony
of
impatience
;
swore
that
his
life
and
intellects
would
actually
be
in
jeopardy
by
her
refusal
;
and
when
she
attempted
to
argue
him
out
of
his
demand
,
began
to
rave
with
such
extravagance
,
that
Sophy
was
frightened
into
conviction
:
and
Godfrey
enforcing
the
remonstrances
of
his
friend
,
the
amiable
Emilia
was
teized
into
compliance
.
    
<EOS>
After
breakfast
the
bridegroom
and
his
companion
set
out
for
the
Commons
for
a
licence
,
having
first
agreed
upon
the
house
at
which
the
ceremony
should
be
performed
,
in
the
lodgings
of
the
bride
:
and
the
permission
being
obtained
,
they
found
means
to
engage
a
clergyman
,
who
undertook
to
attend
them
at
their
own
time
and
place
.
<EOS>
Then
a
ring
was
purchased
for
the
occasion
;
and
they
went
in
search
of
the
lieutenant
,
with
whom
they
dined
at
a
tavern
,
and
not
only
made
him
acquainted
with
the
steps
they
had
taken
,
but
desired
that
he
would
stand
god
-
father
to
the
bride
:
an
employment
which
Jack
accepted
with
demonstrations
of
particular
satisfaction
;
'
till
chancing
to
look
into
the
street
,
and
seeing
Cadwallader
approach
the
door
,
in
consequence
of
a
message
they
had
sent
to
him
by
Pipes
,
he
declined
the
office
in
favour
of
the
senior
;
who
was
accordingly
ordained
for
that
purpose
,
on
the
supposition
that
such
a
mark
of
regard
might
facilitate
his
concurrence
with
a
match
,
which
,
otherwise
,
he
would
certainly
oppose
,
as
he
was
a
professed
enemy
to
wedlock
,
and
,
as
yet
,
ignorant
of
Peregrine
's
intention
.
    
<EOS>
After
having
congratulated
Pickle
upon
his
succession
,
and
shook
his
two
friends
by
the
hand
,
the
misanthrope
asked
whose
mare
was
dead
,
that
he
was
summoned
in
such
a
plaguy
hurry
from
his
dinner
,
which
he
had
been
fain
to
gobble
up
like
a
cannibal
.
<EOS>
Our
hero
gave
him
to
understand
,
that
they
had
made
an
appointment
to
drink
tea
with
two
agreeable
ladies
,
and
were
unwilling
that
he
should
lose
the
opportunity
of
enjoying
an
entertainment
which
he
loved
so
much
.
<EOS>
Crabtree
,
shrivelling
up
his
face
,
like
an
autumn
leaf
,
at
this
intimation
,
cursed
his
complaisance
,
and
swore
they
should
keep
their
assignation
without
him
;
for
he
and
letchery
had
shook
hands
many
years
ago
.
    
<EOS>
The
bridegroom
,
however
,
likening
him
unto
an
old
coachman
,
who
still
delights
in
the
smack
of
the
whip
,
and
dropping
some
flattering
hints
of
his
manhood
,
even
at
these
years
,
he
was
gradually
prevailed
upon
to
accompany
them
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
;
where
,
being
ushered
into
a
dining
-
room
,
they
had
not
waited
three
minutes
when
they
were
joined
by
the
parson
,
who
had
observed
the
hour
with
great
punctuality
.
    
<EOS>
This
gentleman
no
sooner
entered
the
room
,
than
Cadwallader
,
in
a
whisper
to
Gauntlet
,
asked
if
that
was
not
the
cock
-
bawd
;
and
before
the
captain
could
make
any
reply
,
"
What
an
unconscionable
whore
-
master
the
rogue
is
!
<EOS>
(
said
he
)
scarce
discharged
from
confinement
,
and
sweetened
with
a
little
fresh
air
,
and
yet
be
wenches
with
a
pimp
in
canonicals
in
his
pay
.
<EOS>
"
<EOS>
The
door
again
opened
,
and
Emilia
broke
in
upon
them
,
with
such
dignity
of
mien
,
and
divinity
of
aspect
,
as
inspired
every
spectator
with
astonishment
and
admiration
.
    
<EOS>
The
lieutenant
,
who
had
not
seen
her
since
her
charms
were
ripened
into
such
perfection
,
expressed
his
wonder
and
approbation
in
an
exclamation
of
"
Add
's
zooks
!
<EOS>
what
a
glorious
galley
!
"
<EOS>
and
the
misanthrope
's
visage
was
instantly
metamorphosed
into
the
face
of
a
mountain
-
goat
;
he
licked
his
lips
instinctively
,
snuffed
the
air
,
and
squinted
with
a
most
horrible
obliquity
of
vision
.
    
<EOS>
The
bride
and
her
sister
being
seated
,
and
Hatchway
having
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
the
former
,
who
recognized
him
with
particular
civility
,
Peregrine
withdrew
into
another
apartment
with
his
friend
Crabtree
,
to
whom
he
imparted
the
design
of
this
meeting
,
which
the
latter
no
sooner
understood
,
than
he
attempted
to
retreat
,
without
making
any
other
reply
than
that
of
"
Pshaw
!
<EOS>
rot
your
matrimony
!
<EOS>
ca
n't
you
put
your
neck
in
the
noose
,
without
my
being
a
witness
of
your
folly
?
"
    
<EOS>
The
young
gentleman
,
in
order
to
vanquish
this
aversion
,
stepped
to
the
door
of
the
next
room
,
and
begged
the
favour
of
speaking
with
Emilia
,
to
whom
he
introduced
the
testy
old
batchelor
,
as
one
of
his
particular
friends
,
who
desired
to
have
the
honour
of
giving
her
away
.
<EOS>
The
bewitching
smile
with
which
she
received
his
salute
,
and
granted
his
request
,
at
once
overcame
the
disapprobration
of
the
misanthrope
,
who
with
a
relaxation
in
his
countenance
which
had
never
been
perceived
before
that
instant
,
thanked
her
in
the
most
polite
terms
for
such
an
agreeable
mark
of
distinction
.
<EOS>
He
accordingly
led
her
into
the
dining
-
room
,
where
the
ceremony
was
performed
without
delay
;
and
after
the
husband
had
asserted
his
prerogative
on
her
lips
,
the
whole
company
saluted
her
by
the
name
of
Mrs
Pickle
.
    
<EOS>
I
shall
leave
the
sensible
reader
to
judge
what
passed
at
this
juncture
,
within
the
bosoms
of
the
new
-
married
couple
:
    
Peregrine
's
heart
was
fired
with
inexpressible
ardour
and
impatience
;
while
the
transports
of
the
bride
were
mingled
with
a
dash
of
diffidence
and
apprehension
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
saw
it
would
be
too
much
for
both
,
to
bear
their
present
tantalizing
situation
till
night
,
without
some
amusement
to
diverge
their
thoughts
;
and
therefore
proposed
to
pass
part
of
the
evening
at
the
public
entertainment
in
Marybone
-
gardens
,
which
were
at
that
time
frequented
by
the
best
company
in
town
.
<EOS>
The
scheme
was
relished
by
the
discreet
Sophy
,
who
saw
the
meaning
of
the
proposal
,
and
the
bride
submitted
to
the
persuasion
of
her
sister
;
so
that
,
after
tea
,
two
coaches
were
called
,
and
Peregrine
was
forcibly
separated
from
his
charmer
,
during
the
conveyance
.
    
<EOS>
While
they
stood
before
the
orchestra
,
listening
to
an
English
ballad
,
which
was
sung
in
a
very
agreeable
manner
,
our
hero
perceived
a
taudry
Frenchman
leaning
against
a
post
,
and
entertaining
himself
with
a
soliloquy
upon
the
barbarous
want
of
taste
in
England
,
so
conspicuous
in
the
applause
which
was
given
to
that
miserable
performance
;
and
as
his
remarks
were
not
made
without
some
insolent
reflections
upon
the
nation
,
he
marked
him
as
a
proper
object
for
his
ridicule
,
and
began
to
project
some
scheme
for
exposing
him
to
the
mirth
of
the
company
,
because
he
looked
upon
him
as
some
pert
valet
de
chambre
,
who
assumed
the
character
of
a
gentleman
,
by
the
night
;
when
he
was
saved
the
trouble
of
inventing
by
an
accident
which
the
foreigner
of
himself
incurred
.
    
<EOS>
One
of
the
waiters
belonging
to
the
place
,
had
marked
with
chalk
the
score
of
a
company
whom
he
attended
,
on
the
very
post
which
the
Frenchman
had
thought
proper
to
occupy
:
so
that
,
when
he
walked
away
,
he
carried
off
the
greatest
part
of
the
reckoning
upon
his
bag
and
shoulders
.
<EOS>
The
servant
coming
to
add
another
bottle
to
the
account
,
perceived
almost
the
whole
particulars
of
the
bill
effaced
,
and
began
to
raise
an
hideous
outcry
against
the
people
that
stood
nearest
him
:
upon
which
our
hero
told
him
how
the
misfortune
had
happened
,
and
pointed
out
the
person
who
bore
the
impression
upon
his
back
.
<EOS>
This
intelligence
was
no
sooner
communicated
,
than
the
waiter
,
calling
some
of
his
brethren
to
his
assistance
,
went
in
pursuit
of
the
delinquent
(
while
Pickle
desired
his
company
to
take
notice
)
and
telling
him
,
that
he
had
carried
off
part
of
a
reckoning
,
desired
he
would
return
,
that
they
might
compare
the
marks
upon
his
bag
with
the
fragment
which
remained
upon
the
post
.
    
<EOS>
The
Frenchman
,
who
did
not
understand
one
word
of
the
English
language
,
seeing
himself
accosted
in
a
very
petulant
manner
by
this
attendant
,
at
first
imagined
that
he
and
his
companions
came
with
a
design
to
affront
him
,
because
he
was
a
foreigner
;
and
therefore
thinking
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
support
the
dignity
of
his
nation
,
began
to
talk
very
big
in
his
native
tongue
,
and
,
in
order
to
inforce
his
words
,
laid
his
hand
upon
his
sword
,
in
a
very
menacing
posture
:
upon
which
the
confederates
flew
upon
him
,
and
securing
both
his
arms
,
led
him
backward
through
a
lane
of
people
,
who
laughed
heartily
at
his
captivity
,
which
he
now
believed
to
be
the
effect
of
an
information
laid
against
him
,
for
some
trespass
upon
our
laws
,
and
,
with
a
most
ludicrous
expression
of
fear
,
protested
,
that
he
was
utterly
ignorant
and
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
apprehended
.
    
<EOS>
Being
conducted
to
the
spot
,
his
back
was
applied
to
the
post
,
and
the
separate
parts
of
the
score
matched
like
two
exchequer
tallies
;
by
which
means
they
were
able
to
ascertain
the
reckoning
,
and
then
dismiss'd
the
counterpart
,
who
had
stood
under
their
hands
,
with
a
most
rueful
face
of
expectation
,
and
afforded
merriment
to
a
whole
crowd
of
spectators
,
a
great
part
of
whom
gave
him
a
convoy
to
the
gate
,
by
which
he
made
his
retreat
with
great
expedition
.
    
<EOS>
The
new
-
married
couple
and
their
company
having
made
shift
to
spend
the
evening
,
and
supped
on
a
slight
collation
in
one
of
the
boxes
,
Peregrine
's
patience
was
almost
quite
exhausted
;
and
taking
Godfrey
aside
,
he
imparted
his
intention
to
withdraw
in
private
from
the
sea
-
wit
of
his
friend
Hatchway
,
who
would
,
otherwise
,
retard
his
bliss
,
with
unseasonable
impediments
,
which
,
at
present
,
he
could
not
possibly
bear
.
<EOS>
Gauntlet
,
who
sympathized
with
his
impatience
,
undertook
to
intoxicate
the
lieutenant
with
bumpers
to
the
joy
of
the
bride
,
and
,
in
the
mean
time
,
desired
Sophy
to
retire
with
his
sister
,
under
the
auspices
of
Cadwallader
,
who
promised
to
squire
them
home
.
    
<EOS>
The
ladies
were
accordingly
conducted
to
the
coach
,
and
Jack
proposed
to
the
captain
,
that
,
for
the
sake
of
the
joke
,
the
bridegroom
should
be
plied
with
liquor
,
in
such
a
manner
as
would
effectually
disable
him
from
enjoying
the
fruits
of
his
good
fortune
for
one
night
at
least
.
    
<EOS>
Gauntlet
seemed
to
relish
the
scheme
,
and
they
prevailed
upon
Pickle
to
accompany
them
to
a
certain
tavern
,
on
pretence
of
drinking
a
farewel
glass
to
a
single
life
;
there
the
bottle
was
circulated
,
till
Hatchway
's
brain
began
to
suffer
innovation
,
and
as
he
had
secured
our
hero
's
hat
and
sword
,
he
felt
no
apprehension
of
an
elopement
,
which
,
however
,
was
effected
;
and
the
youth
hastened
on
the
wings
of
love
to
the
arms
of
his
enchanting
bride
.
<EOS>
He
found
Crabtree
in
a
parlour
,
waiting
for
his
return
,
and
disposed
to
entertain
him
with
a
lecture
upon
temperance
;
to
which
he
paid
very
little
attention
,
but
ringing
for
Emilia
's
maid
,
desired
to
know
if
her
mistress
was
a
-
bed
.
<EOS>
Being
answered
in
the
affirmative
,
he
sent
her
up
stairs
to
announce
his
arrival
,
undressed
himself
to
a
loose
gown
and
slippers
,
and
wishing
the
misanthrope
good
-
night
,
after
having
desired
to
see
him
next
day
,
followed
in
person
to
the
delicious
scene
,
where
he
found
her
elegantly
dished
out
,
the
fairest
daughter
of
chastity
and
love
.
    
<EOS>
When
he
approached
,
she
was
overwhelmed
with
confusion
,
and
hid
her
lovely
face
from
his
transported
view
;
while
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
seeing
his
eyes
kindled
at
the
occasion
,
kissed
her
charming
sister
,
who
,
throwing
her
snowy
arms
about
her
neck
,
would
have
detained
her
in
the
room
,
had
not
Peregrine
gently
disengaged
her
confidante
from
her
embrace
,
and
conducted
her
trembling
to
the
door
;
which
having
bolted
and
barricadoed
,
he
profited
by
his
good
fortune
,
and
his
felicity
was
perfect
.
    
<EOS>
Next
day
he
rose
about
noon
,
and
found
his
three
friends
assembled
,
when
he
learned
that
Jack
had
fallen
in
his
own
snare
,
and
been
obliged
to
lie
in
the
same
tavern
where
he
fell
:
a
circumstance
of
which
he
was
so
much
ashamed
,
that
Peregrine
and
his
wife
escaped
many
jokes
,
which
he
would
have
certainly
cracked
,
had
he
not
lain
under
the
predicament
of
this
disgrace
.
    
<EOS>
In
half
an
hour
after
he
came
down
,
Mrs
Pickle
appeared
with
Sophy
,
blushing
like
Aurora
or
the
goddess
of
health
,
and
sending
forth
emanations
of
beauty
unparallelled
:
she
was
complimented
upon
her
change
of
situation
by
all
present
,
and
by
none
more
warmly
than
by
old
Crabtree
,
who
declared
himself
so
well
satisfied
with
his
friend
's
fortune
,
as
to
be
almost
reconciled
to
that
institution
,
against
which
he
had
declaimed
during
the
best
part
of
his
life
.
    
<EOS>
An
express
was
immediately
dispatched
to
Mrs
Gauntlet
,
with
an
account
of
her
daughter
's
marriage
;
a
town
-
house
was
hired
,
and
an
handsome
equipage
set
up
,
in
which
the
new
-
married
pair
appeared
at
all
public
places
,
to
the
astonishment
of
our
adventurer
's
fair
-
weather
friends
,
and
the
admiration
of
all
the
world
:
for
,
in
point
of
figure
,
such
another
couple
was
not
to
be
found
in
the
whole
united
kingdom
.
<EOS>
Envy
despaired
,
and
detraction
was
struck
dumb
,
when
our
hero
's
new
accession
of
fortune
was
consigned
to
the
celebration
of
public
fame
<EOS>
:
Emilia
attracted
the
notice
of
all
observers
,
from
the
pert
templar
to
the
Sovereign
himself
,
who
was
pleased
to
bestow
encomiums
upon
the
excellence
of
her
beauty
.
<EOS>
Many
persons
of
consequence
,
who
had
dropped
the
acquaintance
of
Peregrine
,
in
the
beginning
of
his
decline
,
now
made
open
efforts
to
cultivate
his
friendship
anew
:
but
he
discouraged
all
these
advances
with
the
most
mortifying
disdain
;
and
one
day
,
when
the
nobleman
,
whom
he
had
formerly
obliged
,
came
up
to
him
in
the
drawing
-
room
,
with
the
salutation
of
"
Your
servant
,
Mr
Pickle
,
"
he
eyed
him
with
a
look
of
ineffable
contempt
,
saying
,
"
I
suppose
your
lordship
is
mistaken
in
your
man

his
head

When
he
had
made
a
circuit
round
all
the
places
frequented
by
the
beau
-
monde
,
to
the
utter
confusion
of
those
against
whom
his
resentment
was
kindled
;
paid
off
his
debts
,
and
settled
his
money

matters
in
town
;
Hatchway
was
dismissed
to
the
country
,
in
order
to
prepare
for
the
reception
of
his
fair
Emilia
;

in
a
few
days
after
his
departure
,
the
whole
company
(
Cadwallader
himself
included
)
set
out
for
his
father
's
house
,
and
,
in
their
way
,
took
up
Mrs

,
who
was
sincerely
rejoiced
to
see
our

the
capacity
of
her
son

From
her
habitation
they
proceeded
homewards
at
an
easy
pace
,
and
,
amidst
the
acclamations
of
the
whole
parish
,
entered
their
own
house
,
where
Emilia
was
received
in
the
most
tender
manner
,
by
Mr
Clover
's
wife
,
who
had
provided
every
thing
for
her
ease
and
accommodation
,
and
,
next
day
,
surrendered
unto
her
the
management
of
her
